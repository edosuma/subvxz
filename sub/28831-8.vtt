00:00.670 --> 00:02.170
Alice: If I didn't know
any better, I'd think
you two were in love.

00:02.170 --> 00:04.170
I'm kidding! No,
you're not in love.

00:05.170 --> 00:06.000
You are in love?

00:07.380 --> 00:09.210
I have something
I need to tell you.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.330
Nice to meet you.
I'm Amanda.

00:10.330 --> 00:11.670
I know, you used
to work at Speckulate.

00:11.670 --> 00:12.880
But you quit?

00:12.880 --> 00:14.080
No, I was fired.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.000
Josh tried to kiss me.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.960
Who all here
has Josh tried to kiss?

00:17.460 --> 00:19.040
Is that Lindsay Brady?

00:19.040 --> 00:20.750
-Avery: Where?
-Alice: They followed me.

00:20.750 --> 00:22.620
It's a major promotion,
you know?

00:22.620 --> 00:24.040
I just don't trust them.

00:24.040 --> 00:25.380
Thomas: They want
something abstract

00:25.380 --> 00:26.540
using earthy materials.

00:26.540 --> 00:28.250
Which is why, when I saw
that piece on you

00:28.250 --> 00:29.460
in the KickinLA profile,

00:29.460 --> 00:30.750
I wanted to bring you in.

00:30.750 --> 00:32.619
Does he know that
you paid for that review?

00:32.619 --> 00:35.580
No, and he's not going to
because I paid for his, too.

00:35.580 --> 00:37.620
Have you given
any more thought
to moving in here?

00:37.620 --> 00:39.210
I think it might be
too soon.

00:39.210 --> 00:40.960
Do you really think Gael
would care that I bought it?

00:40.960 --> 00:42.620
It just really boosted
his confidence.

00:42.620 --> 00:44.120
I don't want
to take that from him.

00:45.380 --> 00:47.040
Hey, can I talk to you?

00:47.040 --> 00:48.080
Sure.

So, my girlfriend's been
on this whole

DNA kick recently, right?

01:32.920 --> 01:34.420
It started with our dog,

who surprise, is 34 percent
Jack Russell. Which I...

Alice:
So, Lindsay got me a spot.

01:40.960 --> 01:42.170
I'm gonna do
my tight-five.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.620
I'm impressed they actually
came through.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.460
When?

01:48.790 --> 01:51.620
Actually,
I don't want you to come.

Avery (on mic):
She says "Babe!

We should do our ancestry."

01:55.460 --> 01:57.460
Yeah. You already know
where this is going.

01:58.460 --> 02:00.620
For her, it was a blast.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.790
She found out that she was
35 percent French,

02:03.540 --> 02:05.330
two percent Cherokee,
which, you know,

02:05.330 --> 02:07.460

Oh. The one
you were meeting for

04:31.830 --> 04:33.790
when you were supposed
to be here doing your job?

04:35.960 --> 04:37.120
Congratulations.

04:46.620 --> 04:50.120
Hi, I'm Callie Adams Foster,
I'm with Public Legal Aid.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.460
-(baby crying)
-Um, I'm not sure

04:51.460 --> 04:52.710
if you're aware,
but this building

04:52.710 --> 04:54.670
was recently purchased by

04:54.670 --> 04:56.670
a C.C. Hastings
Development Corporation.

04:56.670 --> 04:59.210
They're using these
nuisance abatement orders

04:59.210 --> 05:01.290
to try and evict tenants

05:01.290 --> 05:02.960
in order to tear down
your homes

05:02.960 --> 05:05.500
-...and build luxury apartments
and retail shops.
-Hi.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.460
(knocking)

05:07.460 --> 05:08.500
But you have rights.

05:08.500 --> 05:11.000
(loud music playing)

05:11.000 --> 05:12.330
Is there an adult home?

05:14.330 --> 05:15.170
What?

05:16.250 --> 05:17.750
Lisa: I got five tenants
who are in.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.000
-Eight.
-Seven.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.170
Well, we only
need twelve to file
a class action.

05:21.170 --> 05:23.000
-So, we're good to go?
-Not quite.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.710
We need to find
a legal partner
to fund this thing.

05:25.580 --> 05:26.670
So, when do we tell Teresa?

05:27.540 --> 05:28.420
Today.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Time to decide,

05:30.000 --> 05:31.040
are you in or out?

05:33.330 --> 05:35.670
(indistinct conversation)

05:40.670 --> 05:41.580
Woman: Legal Aid.

05:48.670 --> 05:49.580
You got a minute?

05:54.880 --> 05:57.620
Patrisse: Let me tell y'all
why we do disruptions.

05:57.620 --> 06:00.120
It's one of many tactics
we use,

06:00.120 --> 06:02.290
non-violent direct action,
to challenge

06:02.290 --> 06:05.290
the business-as-usual attitude
from our local government.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.880
So, on the day of the action,
you'll get a secure text

06:08.880 --> 06:11.380
from us with a time
and location.

06:12.210 --> 06:16.460
Do not share that information
with anyone.

06:16.460 --> 06:20.120
Not your mama, not your bae,
your boyfriend.

06:20.120 --> 06:24.210
It's top-secret and come alone
and inconspicuously.

06:24.210 --> 06:26.380
Should we be prepared
to get arrested?

06:26.380 --> 06:28.080
Melina: So, this is
a low-risk action.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.960
We're not planning
any arrests,

06:29.960 --> 06:31.380
but we never know.

06:31.380 --> 06:33.670
So, we're gonna have you write
our lawyer's number down

06:33.670 --> 06:35.920
on your arm, just in case.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.170
Does that work for everybody?

06:38.290 --> 06:39.330
Tiana: That works.

06:40.420 --> 06:42.580
Great. Meeting's over.

06:42.580 --> 06:43.620
Tiana: All right.

06:46.460 --> 06:47.460
-Tiana: Hey, girl.
-Malika: Hey.

06:47.460 --> 06:48.750
Tiana: Come over here
for a second.

06:50.750 --> 06:51.920
-Hey.
-Hey.

06:52.580 --> 06:55.750
So, we have a special job
for you, if you're up to it.

06:56.620 --> 06:58.120
Yeah, of course. What is it?

06:58.120 --> 07:00.580
We need someone
to live stream the action

07:00.580 --> 07:01.790
from our BLM accounts.

07:01.790 --> 07:04.330
It's super important,
because we need to get

07:04.330 --> 07:06.790
as many eyes on this action
as possible,

07:06.790 --> 07:08.120
but we also need it
for our safety.

07:08.120 --> 07:11.830
So, that means you can't
stop filming, no matter what,

07:11.830 --> 07:13.750
no matter how hot it gets
up in there.

07:13.750 --> 07:14.960
Are you good with that?

07:17.330 --> 07:19.290
Absolutely.
Whatever you need.

07:19.290 --> 07:20.120
Patrisse: Great.

07:32.460 --> 07:33.620
Come play with us.

07:35.290 --> 07:37.620
Dennis: I can't.
I gotta go to work!

07:37.620 --> 07:39.120
Will you come
to the movie later?

07:39.790 --> 07:41.210
I'm sorry,
I gotta miss it.

07:41.210 --> 07:42.960
You miss a lot.

07:43.830 --> 07:44.880
I know.

07:45.960 --> 07:48.120
Jennifer: He's gonna
grow up and be gone
before you know it.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.790
Dennis:
You think that I want
to work all the time

07:49.790 --> 07:50.960
and miss everything?

07:50.960 --> 07:52.620
But who's gonna pay
for this house

07:52.620 --> 07:54.040
and the cars
and the private school

07:54.040 --> 07:56.420
and the boxes that show up here
every single day?

07:56.420 --> 07:58.670
-Look, I'm just saying--
-Dennis: I know exactly
what you're saying,

07:58.670 --> 08:00.250
and I feel guilty enough
as it is,

08:00.250 --> 08:01.750
but you wanted
this lifestyle.

08:01.750 --> 08:04.040
I'm not doing this
for me.
It's not like I'm happy.

08:07.380 --> 08:08.500
(knocking on door)

08:17.000 --> 08:18.500
-Hi.
-Hi.

08:21.580 --> 08:24.000
Teresa: If you choose to assist
Marcus on this class action,

08:24.000 --> 08:25.750
you'll still be expected
to fulfill

08:25.750 --> 08:27.330
all your
research responsibilities,

08:28.210 --> 08:29.920
and we don't pay overtime.

08:29.920 --> 08:30.920
I understand.

08:31.830 --> 08:34.539
You should also be aware
of how these things work.

08:34.539 --> 08:35.830
Since you haven't passed
the bar yet,

08:35.830 --> 08:37.710
you won't be listed as one
of the filing attorneys.

08:38.710 --> 08:40.919
Which means you get
no credit for your work,

08:40.919 --> 08:42.539
and because these firms

08:42.539 --> 08:45.210
we partner with dump
all the heavy lifting on us,

08:45.210 --> 08:47.290
we're talking
a lot of unpaid hours.

08:47.710 --> 08:50.540
Which is why I choose more
than just the merits of a case.

08:50.540 --> 08:53.080
I consider the return
on the time commitment

08:53.080 --> 08:54.620
and the emotional toll
that it takes

08:54.620 --> 08:56.290
on your personal
and professional life.

09:02.540 --> 09:03.620
I'm sorry.

09:06.420 --> 09:09.460
You were not
a shitty husband or father.

09:11.210 --> 09:13.420
I was just angry
and trying to hurt you.

09:14.380 --> 09:15.460
Well, I put my...

09:16.380 --> 09:17.880
work before you and Jacob,

09:19.040 --> 09:20.080
and...

09:21.170 --> 09:22.830
I wasn't around.

09:22.830 --> 09:23.830
Jennifer: You were...

09:24.830 --> 09:25.670
when it mattered.

09:25.670 --> 09:26.670
No, it all mattered.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.250
-Daddy, please.
-Dennis: Jacob, damn it!

09:29.250 --> 09:30.580
I said go back to bed!

09:30.580 --> 09:32.580
It all mattered,
every second of it.

09:37.580 --> 09:38.580
I should have known.

09:39.670 --> 09:40.500
How?

09:42.750 --> 09:45.080
It was not your fault
he got sick.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.580
You loved him
to the very end,

09:50.000 --> 09:51.250
and he loved you.

09:54.080 --> 09:56.500
I shouldn't have
pushed you away after he died.

10:00.580 --> 10:02.460
I just needed
someone to blame.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.000
We pushed each other away.

10:16.790 --> 10:17.620
Yeah.

10:20.790 --> 10:22.120
I still love you.

10:26.330 --> 10:27.830
I still love you, too.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.460
(chuckles)

10:33.120 --> 10:34.540
That was like a hundred
and thirty-eight.

10:35.290 --> 10:36.170
What?

10:36.170 --> 10:37.540
Sixty-nine, twice.

10:37.540 --> 10:40.460
Oh, my god,
you're so funny.

10:40.460 --> 10:41.790
(chuckles)

10:41.790 --> 10:43.040
You should be a comedian.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.580
Oh, and give up my dreams of
plunging the toilets around here

10:45.580 --> 10:46.540
for the rest of my life?

10:46.540 --> 10:47.580
Well...

10:48.540 --> 10:50.500
just in case...

10:51.580 --> 10:53.330
you change your mind.

10:53.330 --> 10:54.540
What's this?

10:55.420 --> 10:57.000
(both laughing)

10:57.000 --> 10:58.580
Okay.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.670
Business cards?

11:08.670 --> 11:10.710
Well, you have to have something
to hand to bookers

11:10.710 --> 11:13.000
and people who are going
to help you get gigs.

11:15.080 --> 11:18.000
Mm, that's like
the sweetest thing ever.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.250
I want you to know
I believe in you.

11:22.250 --> 11:23.330
Thank you.

11:28.380 --> 11:30.710
So, Lindsay thinks
I'm ready to go up.

11:31.380 --> 11:33.750
I will say that
I'm incredibly sexy.

11:33.750 --> 11:35.750
Seriously, I am.
Watch this.

11:38.580 --> 11:40.290
Not funny?
How about this?

11:42.420 --> 11:45.210
I think it'd be funnier
and, honestly, more surprising,

11:45.210 --> 11:47.380
you know,
if you did actual sexy,

11:47.380 --> 11:49.380
instead of, like, mock sexy.

11:49.380 --> 11:50.790
You know, something
like you did,

11:50.790 --> 11:52.250
that dance at
your friend's party.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.420
(cheering)

11:55.420 --> 11:57.710
Just for the record, I didn't
post any of that myself.

11:57.710 --> 11:59.460
(chuckles)
Why not?

11:59.460 --> 12:02.040
You looked super cool
and it was hella hot.

12:03.920 --> 12:06.670
So, are you going to tell them
that I'm your partner?

12:07.790 --> 12:08.670
Should I?

12:09.830 --> 12:13.170
I mean, do I need
to disclose it?

12:13.170 --> 12:14.620
I mean, it feels kind of random,

12:14.620 --> 12:16.290
until they ask me
if I have a partner.

12:17.120 --> 12:18.460
Yeah. Yeah, I guess you...

12:19.420 --> 12:21.000
you're better off
not mentioning me.

12:23.080 --> 12:27.080
So, can I ask you why
you're being so nice to me?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.460
I'm not nice.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.960
I just like helping
queer comics, you know.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.330
It's hard enough getting along
in comedy without being

12:33.330 --> 12:35.080
a cis dude, you know.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.920
Or a circus comedy cat.
(chuckles)

12:37.750 --> 12:39.250
That's an actual thing.
You should look it up.

12:39.250 --> 12:40.580
Millions of views.

12:40.580 --> 12:41.830
See, you're totally ready.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.080
-Oh, hey.
-Hey, Tess.

12:45.750 --> 12:47.250
This is Alice,

12:47.250 --> 12:48.830
that comic I was
telling you about.

12:48.830 --> 12:50.620
-Oh, yeah, nice to meet you.
-You too.

12:51.330 --> 12:52.830
She's ready to go up,
can you get her a spot?

12:53.540 --> 12:54.960
-Sure.
-Great.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.290
Thank you, so much.

12:56.290 --> 12:57.960
(cell phone buzzing)

12:58.880 --> 13:00.790
Ah, I have to meet
the plumber.

13:00.790 --> 13:03.000
Toilets are giving me trouble,
you know.

13:03.000 --> 13:03.880
Day in the life.
(chuckles)

13:04.380 --> 13:06.460
Okay, see you at the show.

13:06.460 --> 13:08.120
Yes, I'm very excited.

13:08.120 --> 13:08.960
Great.

13:12.170 --> 13:14.460
-So that's Joey Riverton's
new girlfriend?
-Yep.

13:15.290 --> 13:17.380
And you want to help her?

13:18.120 --> 13:20.460
Sure, why wouldn't I?

13:25.830 --> 13:26.960
(sighs)

13:26.960 --> 13:28.710
Mariana:
It's just being tasked

13:28.710 --> 13:30.500
with heading
the grievance committee,

13:30.500 --> 13:31.830
which is an unpaid position,

13:31.830 --> 13:35.330
and being a team leader,
which I am so grateful for,

13:35.330 --> 13:36.920
and helping out
with dating advice,

13:36.920 --> 13:38.170
which, you know,
I don't mind.

13:38.170 --> 13:39.830
it's just the emotional labor

13:39.830 --> 13:41.500
of it all is taking a toll,

13:41.500 --> 13:43.000
and I should have just
told you.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.920
I was wrong
to snap at you.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.880
I was wrong to ask
so much of you.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.710
Well, I'm sorry.

13:51.170 --> 13:53.750
Me too... and thank you.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.500
You're welcome. Thank you.
(chuckles)

13:57.710 --> 13:58.880
You're welcome.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.830
Um... thank you.

14:00.830 --> 14:01.920
Okay, no,
we're, we're good.

14:03.330 --> 14:04.830
And don't worry about
the chat feature,

14:04.830 --> 14:06.000
we can launch without it,

14:06.000 --> 14:07.670
and I sent the
salary laddering proposal

14:07.670 --> 14:09.000
to the board for approval,

14:09.000 --> 14:10.580
so that's off your plate
as well.

14:11.460 --> 14:12.880
That's amazing! Thank you.

14:13.620 --> 14:14.710
It's the right thing to do.

14:15.460 --> 14:17.460
And I won't bother you
with dating advice anymore.

14:17.460 --> 14:18.580
I've deleted the app.

14:19.620 --> 14:20.790
Why?

14:21.250 --> 14:23.120
Well, it's pretty obvious

14:23.120 --> 14:25.540
that I don't know how
to relate to people.

14:25.540 --> 14:26.920
You relate to people.

14:27.790 --> 14:29.380
You just apologized to me.

14:29.380 --> 14:30.790
After you yelled at me.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.380
It should be more intuitive.

14:36.120 --> 14:38.790
That's why I hired Josh
to help me manage people, but...

14:40.460 --> 14:42.040
I read him all wrong...

14:43.880 --> 14:44.790
and Amanda.

14:47.620 --> 14:50.040
I-I don't know
what you heard, but...

14:52.210 --> 14:53.750
Amanda didn't get fired.

14:54.750 --> 14:55.960
She quit...

14:57.500 --> 14:58.670
because of me.

14:59.830 --> 15:02.250
Because of something
inappropriate that I said

15:02.250 --> 15:04.000
or I did,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.460
and I didn't even realize it.

15:09.920 --> 15:13.920
So clearly, I am just
better off alone.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.460
Angela: I was complicit.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.080
There is no way
I get to keep my job

15:20.080 --> 15:21.120
if Evan finds out.

15:21.120 --> 15:24.290
Mariana, I risked
my entire career

15:24.290 --> 15:26.460
to give you that
salary information

15:26.460 --> 15:28.580
and we have to finish
what we started.

15:30.670 --> 15:31.960
Please.

15:39.380 --> 15:40.620
If I tell you something,

15:40.620 --> 15:43.330
will you promise
not to fire Angela?

15:48.210 --> 15:50.170
I have you to thank for this.

15:51.210 --> 15:52.620
If you hadn't reached out
to that blogger,

15:52.620 --> 15:54.290
I never would have gotten
this review,

15:54.290 --> 15:56.790
and I never would have gotten
this commission.

15:56.790 --> 15:59.670
You earned that review
and the commission.

15:59.670 --> 16:02.790
I just hope you can start
believing in yourself.

16:03.620 --> 16:04.790
Getting there.

16:08.460 --> 16:10.120
I found out who
the anonymous buyer

16:10.120 --> 16:12.210
of my piece
in the art show was.

16:12.210 --> 16:13.290
Who?

16:14.000 --> 16:15.500
Gael:
Why didn't you tell me
Jamie bought

16:15.500 --> 16:16.880
my piece from the art show?

16:18.920 --> 16:21.210
'Cause I didn't know
until after he bought it,

16:22.580 --> 16:24.080
and he bought it anonymously.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.500
Does he know that
you helped me make it?

16:27.330 --> 16:29.580
-No.
-You didn't tell him?

16:30.540 --> 16:32.210
Callie: Because
there's nothing to tell.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.670
I helped you make your piece.
That was all.

16:36.330 --> 16:37.670
That was all?

16:38.040 --> 16:39.500
I didn't do anything wrong.

16:39.500 --> 16:40.670
Why did he buy it?

16:41.830 --> 16:44.500
-Because he liked it.
-No, don't, don't do that to me.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.000
Don't patronize me
more than you already have.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.670
I'm not patronizing you,

16:48.500 --> 16:50.420
and neither was he.

16:50.420 --> 16:52.880
You really believe that?
Is that why it's in
the laundry room?

16:53.330 --> 16:54.380
Laundry room?

16:54.380 --> 16:55.670
Of Jamie's apartment.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.500
I went to pick up
Mariana's flash drive

16:57.500 --> 16:58.880
and I saw it
stored away in there.

17:01.710 --> 17:03.540
It's usually
in the living room,

17:04.619 --> 17:06.040
he put it away

17:06.040 --> 17:07.790
to do some paint touch-ups.

17:07.790 --> 17:09.119
You think it doesn't
make him hard

17:09.119 --> 17:11.880
seeing my piece on his wall
and know that you chose him?

17:13.380 --> 17:14.579
I didn't choose Jamie until--

17:14.579 --> 17:15.960
Until you failed the bar

17:15.960 --> 17:17.750
and panicked and went
with the safe guy

17:17.750 --> 17:19.210
with the money
and the penthouse apartment.

17:19.210 --> 17:20.460
Okay, Jamie is
more than that!

17:20.460 --> 17:22.619
I don't give a shit
what he is, Callie.

17:22.619 --> 17:24.119
You were the one
that I trusted.

17:24.119 --> 17:25.420
The one I thought had my back,

17:25.420 --> 17:27.619
but you're just
as full of shit as he is.

17:30.620 --> 17:33.040
You chose the right guy,
'cause he's perfect for you.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.580
Do you still have feelings
for her?

17:36.580 --> 17:37.580
No.

17:39.750 --> 17:40.830
You know...

17:42.750 --> 17:44.170
you can trust me.

17:47.170 --> 17:48.120
I know.

18:01.170 --> 18:02.330
Wait, you didn't tell him?

18:03.250 --> 18:04.330
I changed my mind.

18:04.790 --> 18:05.750
Why?

18:11.920 --> 18:13.750
Jennifer and I are trying
to work things out.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.290
When did this happen?

18:21.500 --> 18:22.710
Recently.

18:24.290 --> 18:26.000
Well, if that's what you want...

18:27.500 --> 18:29.290
then I wish you
the best of luck.

18:36.790 --> 18:38.960
I just realized
I haven't taken the time

18:38.960 --> 18:40.500
to process
breaking up with Jeff,

18:41.000 --> 18:43.710
and I don't want to leapfrog
from one man to the next.

18:44.460 --> 18:46.880
How do I know my feelings
for Dennis are even real?

18:46.880 --> 18:48.170
They seem pretty real.

18:51.460 --> 18:52.330
(shushes)

18:54.710 --> 18:56.670
(beeping)

18:58.790 --> 19:01.790
(beeping)

19:04.330 --> 19:06.170
I'm not using your mug. See?

19:06.540 --> 19:07.540
It's fine. You can have it.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.170
But your name's on it.

19:21.420 --> 19:22.830
Now it's no one's mug.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.330
I mean, if she doesn't want it.

19:28.330 --> 19:29.670
You told him the truth?

19:29.670 --> 19:31.330
Well, he promised
he wouldn't fire Angela,

19:31.830 --> 19:33.500
and what if Evan and Amanda
are meant to be

19:33.500 --> 19:35.170
and we're just standing
in their way

19:35.170 --> 19:36.330
because no one's being honest?

19:39.040 --> 19:40.500
Don't worry. Not staying.

19:41.170 --> 19:42.670
Just grabbing some stuff
for Jamie's.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.880
Oh, no. It's not
a Raj night. You can stay.

19:46.540 --> 19:47.790
Gee, thanks.

19:47.790 --> 19:49.920
So nice of you
to give me permission

19:49.920 --> 19:51.040
to sleep in my own bed.

19:53.250 --> 19:55.620
Anyway, I told him that
if he reached out,

19:55.620 --> 19:56.960
she'd probably be receptive.

19:56.960 --> 19:58.040
Sure about that?

19:58.040 --> 19:59.880
The way she was talking
about Evan,

19:59.880 --> 20:01.540
I'm pretty sure
the feelings were mutual

20:01.540 --> 20:02.620
and still could be.

20:03.710 --> 20:05.380
What? You think
I should have stayed out of it?

20:05.380 --> 20:08.290
Raj: I think, you know
what happens to the messenger.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.540
They get thanked
in the wedding toast?

20:11.460 --> 20:13.960
Hopefully. Callie,
what do you think?

20:13.960 --> 20:16.460
Why don't you ask
your Coterie Biatches?

20:17.880 --> 20:19.540
Callie, what do you think?

20:19.540 --> 20:21.710
Huh? Oh, I wasn't listening.

20:22.420 --> 20:23.290
Night.

20:29.750 --> 20:30.920
What's with her?

20:32.750 --> 20:35.170
I wanted to invite you
to my dad's birthday dinner.

20:35.750 --> 20:37.330
You know,
finally meet the family.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.920
If, you know,
you're cool with that.

20:40.500 --> 20:41.460
Yeah.

20:42.620 --> 20:43.620
I'd love to come.

20:44.670 --> 20:45.670
(chuckles)

20:45.670 --> 20:46.620
Bring Dom, too.

20:47.250 --> 20:48.250
Dom?

20:48.250 --> 20:50.460
Yeah, I, I want both
our families to meet.

20:52.420 --> 20:54.080
-Okay.
-Yeah?

20:54.080 --> 20:56.170
-I'll ask him.
-Cool. I'll, uh,

20:56.960 --> 20:58.580
pick you guys
up here around six?

20:58.580 --> 20:59.620
Okay.

21:00.290 --> 21:01.920
-Okay?
-Okay.

21:01.920 --> 21:03.330
-Hmm.
-Round two.

that you are trying
to work things out.

21:37.790 --> 21:38.710
That's great.

any idea what

About what?

22:55.210 --> 22:56.460
The class action?

22:56.460 --> 22:57.960
It's a lot of work,

22:57.960 --> 23:00.420
and I'm gonna
piss off Teresa.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.380
And what about having time

23:04.710 --> 23:06.710
Well, I'm not sure
I would have any.

23:08.420 --> 23:09.620

23:16.830 --> 23:17.830
No, you're right.

23:19.080 --> 23:21.330
Passing the bar should be
my first priority.

23:22.420 --> 23:23.750
I don't want to get stuck
in this job.

How's it going?

23:50.960 --> 23:52.460
Thomas (over phone):
Not great.

23:52.460 --> 23:53.790
We're pulling our offer
on the commission.

23:54.290 --> 23:56.120
-Why? What happened?
-Thomas: Check your inbox.

23:56.120 --> 23:58.170
We can't be associated
with any controversy.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.790

Uh?

24:11.460 --> 24:12.620
What?

24:16.000 --> 24:17.380

24:35.960 --> 24:37.170
I brought a few things
from home.

24:38.040 --> 24:40.710
And by few, you mean
your whole wardrobe?

24:41.210 --> 24:42.580
Well, just one
of my closets.

24:43.830 --> 24:45.670
Oh, okay. Um...

24:46.330 --> 24:47.830
well, I, I think
I'd stay away

24:47.830 --> 24:50.040

Sorry, I don't mean
to criticize your style.

24:56.170 --> 24:57.170
No, it's not my style.

24:57.170 --> 24:59.080
I have an online
personal shopping assistant.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.170
Her name is Sheila.

25:01.170 --> 25:04.420
Oh, well, (smacks lips)
Sheila has interesting taste.

25:07.670 --> 25:09.500
Uh, maybe we'll try this.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.250
Oh, okay.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.080
You didn't mean now?

25:16.710 --> 25:18.330
No, it's fine.

25:33.960 --> 25:36.460
(chuckles) Oh.
Man, you look like
you could use a drink.

25:36.460 --> 25:37.580
And a toilet.

25:37.960 --> 25:39.040
I feel like
I'm gonna throw up.

25:39.620 --> 25:40.710
That's a good sign.

25:41.380 --> 25:42.380
All right...

25:43.540 --> 25:44.620
take a sip.

25:45.790 --> 25:46.960

25:47.710 --> 25:49.250

for good luck.

25:50.580 --> 25:51.960
-Come on.
-Okay.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.790
Is this a thing
that comics do?

25:56.790 --> 25:58.790
Yeah, I mean,
everyone needs a ritual

25:58.790 --> 26:01.000
before they go on stage,
you know.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.670
Yeah. What's yours?

26:13.290 --> 26:14.620
(Marcus muttering)

26:14.620 --> 26:18.500
Hey. So, um, I've given it
a lot of thought and I--

26:18.500 --> 26:20.120
Marcus:
Hold on a second, Callie.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.000
-Sariya! Thank you
for coming to us.
-Sariya: No problem.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.580
It's nice to get
out of the office.

26:23.580 --> 26:25.960
It's my dream to work
for the ACLU.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.170
Sariya:
Once you pass the bar,

26:27.170 --> 26:29.250
I don't see why we can't make
that dream come true.

26:32.620 --> 26:35.170
-Callie.
-I remember. Yeah.

26:35.170 --> 26:37.250
So, are you working here?

26:37.250 --> 26:38.960
Uh, yeah,
as a research assistant.

26:38.960 --> 26:40.580
Marcus: Callie brought
this case to my attention.

26:41.290 --> 26:42.540
Well, good eye.

26:42.540 --> 26:44.380
These big developers
are gentrifying

26:44.380 --> 26:47.000
the only affordable
neighborhoods left in LA.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.040
I mean, we've seen homeless
districts explode in our city.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.620
This is why, we have

26:50.620 --> 26:52.460
a humanitarian crisis
in our own backyard.

26:52.460 --> 26:55.290
ACLU's interested in partnering
with us on this one.

26:55.290 --> 26:57.790
Sariya: Yeah, well,
someone's gotta fight
for affordable housing, right?

26:58.460 --> 27:00.960
We couldn't agree more.
Why don't we meet
in the conference room?

27:00.960 --> 27:01.960
Right this way.

27:04.790 --> 27:05.620
You coming?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.920

Amanda?

29:59.290 --> 30:00.290
Right.

30:02.210 --> 30:03.460
Okay, well,
have a good time.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.960
You promised me
you wouldn't fire Angela.

30:09.540 --> 30:11.330
-I didn't.
-Oh, really? Well, then who did?

30:11.330 --> 30:13.830

30:17.670 --> 30:20.000
Mariana, it is such
a pleasure to meet you.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.830
-I have heard so much about you.
-You have?

30:22.830 --> 30:25.170
Uh, I mean, it's nice
to meet you too.

30:25.170 --> 30:29.080
Kendra is here to oversee
daily operations.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.540
Oh. What does that mean?

30:32.670 --> 30:36.170
Well, um, in light of some
of the recent issues,

30:36.170 --> 30:39.670
I'm just... here to douse
any little fires

30:39.670 --> 30:41.580
and to keep Speckulate
on track.

30:42.170 --> 30:43.380
So, you doused Angela?

30:44.250 --> 30:46.420
Considering many of the issues
were personnel related.

30:46.830 --> 30:49.500
Angela was working
to rectify those.

30:49.500 --> 30:51.250
Rectify issues largely
of her own making.

30:51.250 --> 30:54.290
Well, I'm pretty sure that
Josh had a lot to do with that.

30:54.290 --> 30:57.040
And apparently, he was sexually
harassing a number of women

30:57.040 --> 30:58.290
who made complaints

30:58.290 --> 31:01.380
that Angela failed to bring
to anyone's attention.

31:01.380 --> 31:02.580
She knew?

31:02.580 --> 31:04.620
Kendra: I want to assure you
that I'm here to remedy

31:04.620 --> 31:06.210
the race and gender pay gap

31:06.210 --> 31:09.040
and to encourage
more socially conscious apps,

31:09.040 --> 31:10.420
like your Act-tivism.

31:11.210 --> 31:12.460
Well, that sounds
pretty positive.

31:13.210 --> 31:15.620
Kendra: Yeah, we'll fix
all of these issues internally.

31:17.460 --> 31:21.040
But what we can't abide
is anyone stealing information

31:21.040 --> 31:23.380
and exposing us
to public scrutiny.

31:23.380 --> 31:25.120
Which is why I'm launching
an investigation

31:25.120 --> 31:27.120
into who was responsible
for publishing

31:27.120 --> 31:28.580
the men's salaries online.

31:29.420 --> 31:31.380
And in the meantime, Mariana,
we need you

31:31.380 --> 31:33.380
to step down as team leader
of your app.

31:34.250 --> 31:35.250
Why?

31:35.250 --> 31:36.330
Uh, that's not your call.

31:36.330 --> 31:38.830
It's my understanding
from the board that it is.

31:38.830 --> 31:41.170
Well, your understanding
is incorrect.

31:41.170 --> 31:42.420
This is my company.

31:44.460 --> 31:47.500
You have some issues of your own
to deal with, Evan.

31:48.250 --> 31:49.460
What issues?

31:50.620 --> 31:53.920
You're being sued
by a former employee
for wrongful termination.

31:54.750 --> 31:56.580
-Who? Josh?
-Kendra: No.

31:57.670 --> 31:58.920
Amanda Phillips.

32:09.580 --> 32:12.250
Man: Most forced arbitration
clauses require

32:12.250 --> 32:14.120
the consumer
to waive their rights,

32:14.120 --> 32:16.710
while allowing the corporation
to sue in court,

32:16.710 --> 32:19.670
-(cell phone buzzes)
-and consumers often must pay
steep filing fees

32:19.670 --> 32:21.380
just to initiate a case

32:21.380 --> 32:24.540
and pay their share of the
arbitrator's hourly charges.

32:25.290 --> 32:28.460
In addition, forced arbitration
clauses often allow

32:28.460 --> 32:30.790
the corporation
to choose the location,

32:30.790 --> 32:32.620
-(cell phone buzzes)
-regardless of how inconvenient

32:32.620 --> 32:34.960
or costly travel will be
for the consumer.

32:35.880 --> 32:38.790
Since only businesses are
repeat users of an arbitrator,

32:38.790 --> 32:41.120
there is a disincentive
for an arbitrator

32:41.120 --> 32:44.960
to rule in favor of a consumer
if he expects further retention.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.830
All right, guys.
That's my time.
Y'all have a great night!

32:46.830 --> 32:48.790
(patrons cheering, whooping)

32:51.620 --> 32:54.330
Okay, give a hand
to our next comic,

32:54.330 --> 32:56.120
she's a virgin to the stage.

32:56.120 --> 32:57.880
Welcome, Alice Kwan!

32:58.500 --> 33:00.080
(cheering, applauding)

33:17.750 --> 33:19.540
Oh. Uh...
(chuckles)

33:19.540 --> 33:22.670
Uh, I was expecting you
to say I rub my belly,

33:22.670 --> 33:24.670
or I listen to Beyonce
or something,

33:24.670 --> 33:26.250
but you're just
out here kissing.

33:26.250 --> 33:28.500
I... I don't know
why I did that.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.580
-I'm s-- I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

33:30.580 --> 33:34.000
It's just, it's just that
I have a partner.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.540
Someone you know, actually.

33:37.540 --> 33:39.290
Joey Riverton.

33:39.960 --> 33:42.460
Yeah. I knew that.

33:43.290 --> 33:44.460
You did?

33:44.460 --> 33:47.040
Yeah, I feel ter--
I'm so sorry.

33:47.040 --> 33:48.880
I can't, uh...

33:48.880 --> 33:51.880
Man, and now I just did to Joey
what they did to me.

33:53.080 --> 33:54.710
What did Joey do to you?

33:56.120 --> 33:58.460
Joey had an affair
with my girlfriend.

33:59.580 --> 34:00.790
They broke us up.

34:04.620 --> 34:06.540
(cheering continues)

34:12.540 --> 34:13.620
(exhales forcefully)

34:14.710 --> 34:16.880
Teresa:
I need these intake interviews
typed and input

34:16.880 --> 34:18.290
into digital files by Monday.

34:18.290 --> 34:20.540
Hope you're not doing anything
this weekend.

34:23.750 --> 34:25.500
(cell phone buzzing)

34:31.170 --> 34:34.250
Why would you send Gael
to Jamie's apartment
in the first place?

34:34.250 --> 34:36.460
I was desperate!
Why'd you keep
the whole thing a secret?

34:36.460 --> 34:37.920
I was trying
to protect Gael.

34:37.920 --> 34:39.960
You know, I think you were just
trying to protect yourself.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.460
Why else did you
hide it from me?

34:41.460 --> 34:43.460
You knew that keeping it
from Gael was wrong.

34:44.420 --> 34:45.620
No wonder he's upset.

34:45.620 --> 34:47.290
I don't blame him!
I'm on his side!

34:48.750 --> 34:50.250
Of course, you are.

34:50.250 --> 34:52.120
'Cause you are never
on my side!

34:52.120 --> 34:54.330
-What are you talking about?
-You're my sister, Mariana!

34:54.330 --> 34:55.500
You're supposed
to have my back!
