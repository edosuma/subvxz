WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.037
She's coming in hot.
She's The Mick.

00:03.071 --> 00:05.173
-Yaah!
-I just built that.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.407
It didn't take.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
And check out our other Fox
programs-- Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
The Last Man on Earth and
Ghosted.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.548
I don't really know how
to do any of this stuff.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.694
What are you still doing here?

00:26.727 --> 00:28.262
School started an hour ago.

00:28.296 --> 00:29.563
I skipped first period history.

00:29.597 --> 00:30.764
It bores me.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.266
Is that my jacket?

00:32.300 --> 00:34.001
Yeah. Spilled some nail polish,

00:34.034 --> 00:35.403
and then I was looking
through your clothes

00:35.436 --> 00:37.705
for a rag to clean it up.
There it was.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.073
Pretty cute.
I can't believe it was yours.

00:39.107 --> 00:40.007
Whatever. Keep it.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.075
Jacket's bad juju.

00:41.109 --> 00:42.543
Last time I wore that,

00:42.576 --> 00:44.011
I took some bad acid,
almost lost my mind.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.045
-I don't care.
-Blind Melon,

00:45.079 --> 00:46.547
Foxboro, '93.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.716
It just started
pouring down rain

00:48.749 --> 00:50.251
right when they were playing
"No Rain."

00:51.585 --> 00:53.087
I-I couldn't make sense of it.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.522
Mm. As much as I'd love to hear

00:54.555 --> 00:56.190
-your burnout loser origin
story... -No, no, no. Nope.

00:56.224 --> 00:58.226
-Uh, what are you doing? Ow!
-Spread 'em.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.294
-Come on, Mickey.
Are you serious? -Yeah.

01:00.328 --> 01:02.630
-Ow. -You've got that Yale
interview this afternoon,

01:02.663 --> 01:04.398
and I am going to make sure
that you will be there.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.066
-How do you know about that?
-I make it my business

01:06.100 --> 01:08.469
to know anything that gets you
out of my life faster.

01:08.502 --> 01:09.803
Hmm.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.772
Planning a little beach day,
are we?

01:11.805 --> 01:14.142
Looks to me like you're prepared
for anything but school.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.377
Yeah, well, it's senior year,
and I have straight As.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.912
Plus, I'm a legacy, okay?
Pembertons go to Yale.

01:18.946 --> 01:20.381
You're going to that interview.
Nothing is more important to me

01:20.414 --> 01:22.216
than shipping you off
to college,

01:22.250 --> 01:24.885
'cause as soon as you're gone,
this house is mine.

01:24.918 --> 01:25.953
What about Chip and Ben?

01:25.986 --> 01:27.555
Chip's a coward
I can easily steamroll,

01:27.588 --> 01:29.223
and Ben can be molded
in my image.

01:29.257 --> 01:30.891
Just got to cut
the head off that snake,

01:30.924 --> 01:32.493
and everything'll fall
into place.

01:32.526 --> 01:33.661
Have a good interview.

01:35.696 --> 01:38.466
*

01:41.034 --> 01:42.836
(inhales)

01:42.870 --> 01:44.272
-(phone ringing and buzzing)
-(grunts, coughs)

01:44.305 --> 01:45.406
Hey...

01:45.439 --> 01:48.276
Ah, ah.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.110
Hola, Dagoberto.

01:50.144 --> 01:52.246
How is the family?

01:52.280 --> 01:54.982
What? Where-where?

01:55.015 --> 01:57.017
Where-- in America?

01:57.050 --> 01:58.819
Well, uh-- well...

01:58.852 --> 02:01.755
No, yeah. Y-Yes, uh, of course
you can come visit me at my job

02:01.789 --> 02:04.192
where I am always working.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.160
Okay. See you soon. Yeah. Bye.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.332
(muttering)

02:11.365 --> 02:13.133
* All I can say

02:13.167 --> 02:16.637
* Is that my life
is pretty plain *

02:16.670 --> 02:19.673
* I like watching the puddles

02:19.707 --> 02:22.810
* Gather rain

02:22.843 --> 02:24.445
* And all I can do...

02:24.478 --> 02:26.447
And that's just
a real good song.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.649
(phone ringing)

02:28.682 --> 02:30.284
-Yeah.
-SABRINA (over phone): Mickey.

02:30.318 --> 02:31.819
I-I'm kind of stuck
in this closet at school,

02:31.852 --> 02:33.053
and I need your help;
I'm freaking out.

02:33.086 --> 02:34.288
Slow down, what's going on?

02:34.322 --> 02:35.856
-I took it.
-You took what?

02:35.889 --> 02:37.291
The acid.

02:37.325 --> 02:39.126
What? What are you
talking about?

02:39.159 --> 02:40.828
-What acid?
-From the tin in your jacket.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.830
We were studying Picasso in art,
I thought-- I thought

02:42.863 --> 02:45.566
it would be fun, but I think
I might be starting to lose it.

02:45.599 --> 02:48.869
Okay. Okay.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.904
We're just... we're just gonna
ride this out.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.373
You-You've been here before,
right?

02:52.406 --> 02:55.008
-No, never.
-What? Are you insane?

02:55.042 --> 02:57.378
That is some pretty high-octane
stuff for your first time.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.079
I know, but it's, like,
a hundred years old!

02:59.112 --> 03:01.549
-I mean, how strong could it be?
-I don't know, Sabrina.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.851
I don't think there are a lot
of studies on the potency of LSD

03:03.884 --> 03:07.154
marinating inside denim jackets
for two decades.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.390
All right, okay--
I-I'll be there in 20 minutes.

03:09.423 --> 03:10.824
Just, I'll meet you out front.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.993
Uh, no way.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.695
Mm-mm, nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.697
I'm not leaving, I can't do it
and I won't do it.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.866
Yes, you can and you will.
You just open the door

03:18.899 --> 03:20.734
-and you walk out.
-And then what?

03:20.768 --> 03:22.670
I walk through another door
and out another door

03:22.703 --> 03:25.172
and through another door,
without direction or purpose?

03:25.205 --> 03:26.407
All right,
just h-h-hold on tight.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.508
-I'll be there soon.
-Oh, God.

03:27.541 --> 03:28.776
(groaning)

03:28.809 --> 03:29.910
(doorbell rings)

03:29.943 --> 03:31.845
(exhales)

03:31.879 --> 03:33.046
Dagoberto! (laughs)

03:33.080 --> 03:34.882
-Alba!
-It is so good to see you.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.084
(speaks Spanish)
I missed you so much!

03:37.117 --> 03:39.587
-Oh, we miss you. But I can see
why you left. -Yeah.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.789
This is a beautiful palace
you live in.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.223
Oh, well, maybe at first glance,

03:43.257 --> 03:45.393
but it is more like
a beautiful prison.

03:45.426 --> 03:48.929
I spend my days scrubbing
the many floors and windows.

03:48.962 --> 03:50.464
It is a hard life.

03:50.498 --> 03:52.232
-Oh, maybe I can help you?
-Oh, no, no, no.

03:52.266 --> 03:55.035
No, no. I would not subject you
to my personal hell.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.737
-Don't be silly.
It's no trouble. -Dagoberto,

03:56.770 --> 03:57.971
-yeah, I am telling you...
-I can do anything...

03:58.005 --> 04:00.608
-You need to un...
-(door opens)

04:00.641 --> 04:01.875
Uh, M-Mr. Chip,

04:01.909 --> 04:03.544
you are home so early.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.547
Okay, whatever you're doing,
just stop.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.748
Who's this guy?

04:07.781 --> 04:09.249
-Wha...
-I am Dagoberto.

04:09.283 --> 04:10.484
-It is so nice to...
-Uh, yeah.

04:10.518 --> 04:13.220
(speaking Spanish)

04:13.253 --> 04:14.588
Okay.

04:14.622 --> 04:17.124
All right, what the hell
is going on here?

04:17.157 --> 04:18.892
Okay, he is my cousin
from Guatemala.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.728
I-If word ever got back
to my family

04:20.761 --> 04:23.096
of the life that I am living,
they would disown me.

04:23.130 --> 04:26.233
I mean, to come to America
and not work is very shameful.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.735
-It's also shameful in America.
-Well...

04:27.768 --> 04:29.603
Please, I-I just need you
to pretend

04:29.637 --> 04:31.505
that I am still the keeper
of this house.

04:31.539 --> 04:34.608
So you want me to treat you
like a maid?

04:34.642 --> 04:36.777
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I can do that.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.245
Oh, thank you, Chip.
Hey, why are you here, anyway?

04:38.278 --> 04:39.680
Shouldn't you be in school?

04:39.713 --> 04:41.515
Oh, I got sent home
because I was making fun

04:41.549 --> 04:42.916
of some kid in gym class.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.284
I was destroying him
with sick burns.

04:44.318 --> 04:46.286
I made him cry in front
of everyone, so...

04:46.320 --> 04:47.788
Yeah. Whatever you say.

04:47.821 --> 04:48.689
Put this in my room.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.324
What? Oh, you s...

04:55.363 --> 04:57.030
Come on, Sabrina,
you got to give me something.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.799
I can't look in every single
closet in the school.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.434
SABRINA:
There's a mop. I see a mop.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.436
And shelves, look for shelves.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.271
You're describing
the inside of a closet.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.807
-(woodwinds playing)
-Uh, I hear music.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.209
Music or dying birds?

05:11.345 --> 05:13.547
(teacher speaking indistinctly)

05:15.349 --> 05:18.218
-(hisses)
-(shouts)

05:18.251 --> 05:19.687
Sabrina, open the door.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.788
How do I know it's you?

05:20.821 --> 05:21.889
You just saw me.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.123
You don't know what I saw.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.692
Okay, Sabrina,

05:24.725 --> 05:26.494
if you get expelled,
I will lock you in a closet

05:26.527 --> 05:27.695
for the rest of your life.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.196
(wails)

05:29.229 --> 05:30.664
All right, that--
I-I-I'm just kidding.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.400
I won't do that.
Listen to me.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.734
Please open the door.

05:33.767 --> 05:34.868
No.

05:34.902 --> 05:37.571
Devin. Only Devin can come in.

05:37.605 --> 05:38.739
Who the hell is Devin?

05:38.772 --> 05:39.873
He took it with me.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.008
He understands.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.410
(sighs)
All right.

05:42.443 --> 05:43.711
What does Devin look like?

05:43.744 --> 05:46.480
Uh, he's-he's tall-ish.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.582
Eccentric but not pretentious.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.851
And... Oh, hi-his face.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.753
It-it can-can look
like a stranger's

05:52.786 --> 05:54.755
but then can also look
as familiar as your own.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.390
Right, right. Cool.

05:56.424 --> 05:58.526
Super helpful.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.360
Are you serious?

06:00.394 --> 06:03.997
How the hell
am I supposed to find...

06:04.031 --> 06:06.534
Devin.

06:06.567 --> 06:09.770
Hey, hey. You're Devin.
You're on acid.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.204
No, no, no. You're not
in trouble. Everything's good.

06:11.238 --> 06:12.440
I'm just trying to...

06:12.473 --> 06:14.374
No, wait, I just need
to talk to you for just...

06:14.408 --> 06:16.209
Whoa!

06:16.243 --> 06:19.179
Wow.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.515
Could've approached that better,
I see that.

06:21.549 --> 06:24.384
So, uh, when
is your vacation over?

06:24.418 --> 06:26.520
-Well, I was gonna tell you
over dinner. -Uh-huh.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.288
But I am here forever.

06:28.321 --> 06:29.790
What?

06:29.823 --> 06:32.025
You have inspired me.
I see how good you are doing,

06:32.059 --> 06:34.227
and I think maybe
I can do that, too.

06:34.261 --> 06:35.563
Oh, Dag, you cannot do this.

06:35.596 --> 06:36.597
-Why not?
-Well...

06:36.630 --> 06:37.698
it-it is great,

06:37.731 --> 06:39.767
but America, oh,
it is the worst.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.435
What if I worked here with you?

06:41.469 --> 06:43.737
Then, your job
would not be so hard,

06:43.771 --> 06:45.473
and we could see each other
every day.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.775
-That would be... -Alba, I feel
like ripping some breakfast.

06:47.808 --> 06:49.743
I'm thinking... Mini-Wheats?

06:49.777 --> 06:51.779
Yeah. Right away, Mr. Chip.
(laughs)

06:51.812 --> 06:53.280
Where'd you fly in, JFK?

06:53.313 --> 06:54.548
Newark.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.283
(scoffs)
New Jersey sucks.

06:56.316 --> 06:57.885
Okay, here we go.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.319
(exhales)

06:59.352 --> 07:01.221
I'm probably gonna need a bowl.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.390
Yes. Uh, they are
in the cupboard.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.592
Let me grab one for you.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.159
-(chuckles)
-No problem.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.496
I'll just start pouring,
and if there's no bowl,

07:08.529 --> 07:10.464
looks like you're gonna have
a big mess on your hands.

07:10.498 --> 07:12.065
What? I-- oh, okay, uh...

07:12.099 --> 07:13.433
Let me just...

07:13.467 --> 07:15.636
-(dishes clattering)
-No...

07:15.669 --> 07:16.837
-And time for milk.
-No, it's-- wait,

07:16.870 --> 07:18.105
just, i-it's... ay!

07:18.138 --> 07:19.573
Wait, no, wait,
if you could just...

07:19.607 --> 07:21.174
Please! Wait!

07:21.208 --> 07:22.309
CHIP:
Whoa.

07:22.342 --> 07:23.477
Look at Charlie Hustle.

07:23.511 --> 07:24.578
(chuckles)

07:24.612 --> 07:25.913
Good for you.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.948
-What's your name again?
-Dagoberto.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.583
Where do you keep
the cleaning supplies?

07:29.617 --> 07:30.851
-I have no idea.
-ALBA: Uh...

07:30.884 --> 07:32.486
You know, they are in
the hall closet.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.955
-Can you get them for me?
-Yeah.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.525
This could actually be
a good thing. Hey, Chip.

07:37.558 --> 07:40.027
I need you to hire Dagoberto
and put him to work.

07:40.060 --> 07:43.196
E-Expose him to all the horrors
of-of being in this place.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.331
Alba, please.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.699
I'd be happy to.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.467
-Oh.
-(knock on door)

07:47.501 --> 07:49.336
Sabrina, open up.
I'm here with Devin.

07:49.369 --> 07:51.605
-Ah, got you.
-(yelps) Liar! Liar!

07:51.639 --> 07:53.006
You filthy, lying bitch!

07:53.040 --> 07:54.642
-Yup, I'm the worst.
Come on, let's go. -No!

07:54.675 --> 07:56.844
-Sabrina, just come with me,
please. Plea... -No.

07:56.877 --> 07:59.479
Whoa. Stop it.
What are you doing?

07:59.513 --> 08:01.849
I need Devin. I'm not going
anywhere without Devin.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.984
Why? What is so special
about this kid?

08:04.017 --> 08:06.453
He's on my level.
You don't understand.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.988
Sabrina, I'm trying to help you.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.489
I just need you to trust me,
okay...

08:09.523 --> 08:11.158
-Get your hands off of me!
-(shushing)

08:11.191 --> 08:13.293
Quiet, quiet. Stop it.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.995
-(muffled shout)
-Hold still. Quiet!

08:15.028 --> 08:16.496
Do you understand?
Shut up.

08:19.099 --> 08:23.571
-Okay... that's how you want
to play it... -(whimpers)

08:23.604 --> 08:25.138
so be it.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.074
-What are you doing?
-Well,

08:27.107 --> 08:30.043
if you won't come out,
then I'm going in.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.447
(sighs)

08:37.084 --> 08:38.719
What have I done?

08:38.752 --> 08:41.922
I don't even enjoy making fun
of the kid, you know.

08:41.955 --> 08:44.191
But dude's got no pubes.
I had to clown him.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.493
Everybody knows I'm super funny,

08:46.526 --> 08:48.829
so I think it was
kind of expected.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.431
I don't know, he'll be,
he'll be, he'll be fine, right?

08:51.464 --> 08:53.000
You know, I feel like he'll just
go to school tomorrow,

08:53.033 --> 08:54.401
and people won't even
remember him

08:54.434 --> 08:55.402
getting lit up like that.

08:55.435 --> 08:56.870
He's actually a really dope kid.

08:56.904 --> 08:59.873
I'm sure he'll sprout
hella pubes any day now.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.575
Uh, Mr. Chip, can I talk to you?

09:01.609 --> 09:03.911
Fine.

09:03.944 --> 09:06.346
Yo, Dag, do you think you could
trim those hedges out front

09:06.379 --> 09:07.280
and make 'em look like me?

09:08.982 --> 09:11.284
Dude's got an insane motor.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.621
Yeah, he never stops,
and I can't take it.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.455
You need to run him
into the ground.

09:15.488 --> 09:18.391
Alba, today I woke up
with no maids.

09:18.425 --> 09:20.360
But now I have two.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.896
Dag is the best thing
that's happened to this family

09:22.930 --> 09:24.197
since Jimmy left.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.099
Chip, you cannot do this.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.701
No, it's already done.

09:27.735 --> 09:29.302
So, why don't
you go up to the attic

09:29.336 --> 09:31.104
and sweep those black widows
before someone gets bit.

09:36.644 --> 09:38.578
(both laughing)

09:44.351 --> 09:45.719
What are you laughing at?

09:45.753 --> 09:49.322
Nothing.
What are you laughing at?

09:49.356 --> 09:52.225
I don't know.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.894
Whoa.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.495
Okay, let's make moves.

09:55.528 --> 09:56.797
Last time I did this,
I got claustrophobic,

09:56.830 --> 09:58.165
and I was in a football stadium.

09:58.198 --> 10:00.300
I just gotta do something
real quick.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.669
No, no-no-no-no-no, you don't.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.837
Come on, Sabrina,
I really think we should...

10:03.871 --> 10:05.706
Oh.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.308
Again.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.045
Yep. Yep. Again.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.348
Wait.

10:15.382 --> 10:17.317
-(gasps, exhales)
-Whoa.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.419
Oh...

10:19.452 --> 10:22.790
(entranced gasps)

10:22.823 --> 10:25.592
Uh-uh, uh-uh. Don't look at it.
We gotta go. Let's go.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.127
We gotta get you out of here
before you get busted.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.428
Oh, stop acting like you care.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.930
You just want me gone.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.699
I just don't want you
to sabotage yourself.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.767
But I would've killed
for the opportunities you have.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.936
-Hey.
-Hmm?

10:35.969 --> 10:38.038
You think you're capable
of killing someone?

10:38.071 --> 10:40.040
Without a doubt,
but listen to me.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.875
Your whole entire world
is about to open up.

10:41.909 --> 10:44.211
If you worry too much
about finding out who you are,

10:44.244 --> 10:46.613
then you're never gonna find out
who you are.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.515
(both gasp)

10:51.351 --> 10:54.021
-Wait.
-Huh?

10:56.489 --> 10:58.992
I wanted to be a musician.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.327
-You did?
-Yeah.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.962
I put so much time
into getting high

11:01.995 --> 11:03.797
and going to concerts.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.799
Well, that's not the same
as learning an instrument.

11:05.833 --> 11:08.235
And I see that now, but you know
what, I was afraid.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.537
And, unless you get yourself out
there, you're just gonna become

11:10.570 --> 11:14.041
a face in-in a massive crowd,
just praying to God

11:14.074 --> 11:16.176
that you double-knotted
your shoes tight enough.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.311
I don't want that.
We should go.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.780
-Yes.
-Wait.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.183
Can we bring this?

11:23.216 --> 11:25.719
Absolutely.

11:29.957 --> 11:33.026
Hmm. Okay. We just need to walk
down that hallway

11:33.060 --> 11:34.494
and right out the door.

11:34.527 --> 11:38.398
Easy-peasy, something squeezy.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.902
-Left.
-Mm-hmm.

11:41.935 --> 11:44.004
Right. Left.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.438
-(laughs)
-Right.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.174
-We're doing it.
-See?

11:47.207 --> 11:48.608
-Look at us. Oh.
-We got this.

11:48.641 --> 11:50.744
Okay. Okay.
Here we go.

11:50.778 --> 11:51.879
Nice and easy.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.446
-(school bell ringing)
-Oh.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.082
MICKEY:
Oh.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.083
SABRINA:
No.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.217
Oh, no.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.351
-Oh-- oh, no. Wait.
-Wait.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.586
Wait, no, no.

11:59.619 --> 12:01.855
(Sabrina and Mickey
shouting indistinctly)

12:01.889 --> 12:03.356
No, Mickey!

12:03.390 --> 12:05.425
No, Mickey...!

12:05.458 --> 12:07.227
(Mickey screams)

12:07.260 --> 12:10.463
-Sabrina! No!
-(bell ringing)

12:10.497 --> 12:12.232
No, no...

12:15.435 --> 12:17.637
(sighs, gasps)

12:22.409 --> 12:25.278
(gasps) Devin. Oh, thank God.
Thank God I found you.

12:25.312 --> 12:28.648
You gotta help me.
I'm on acid.

12:28.681 --> 12:29.817
(gasps)

12:29.850 --> 12:32.252
DEVIN:
Aah...!

12:32.285 --> 12:33.921
How does he do that?

12:41.194 --> 12:42.262
-BEN: Aunt Mickey?
-(gasps)

12:42.295 --> 12:44.064
Ben!

12:44.097 --> 12:46.499
My sweet, sweet little angel.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.768
What are you doing here?

12:48.802 --> 12:50.103
I go to school here.

12:53.506 --> 12:57.177
Yes. Yes, I know.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.511
Why aren't you in class?

12:58.545 --> 13:00.680
I had to poop.
What are you doing?

13:00.713 --> 13:02.749
Right this moment,
I'm shepherding Sabrina

13:02.782 --> 13:04.684
through a journey
of self-revelation.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.086
But in-in the big picture, I...

13:06.119 --> 13:07.687
oh, I-I'm sorry, I...

13:07.720 --> 13:09.857
-I don't know.
-(P.A. chimes)

13:09.890 --> 13:12.525
WOMAN (over P.A.): Geno Pinero
to the principal's office.

13:12.559 --> 13:13.861
Geno Pinero
to the principal's office.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.529
What was that?
Was that in my head?

13:16.563 --> 13:18.966
It's an announcement.
It was in my head, too.

13:18.999 --> 13:21.468
Wait, so everyone in the whole
school can hear that?

13:21.501 --> 13:23.170
Yeah, I guess so.

13:23.203 --> 13:26.339
Ben, you're a genius!

13:26.373 --> 13:28.208
Now, go poop!

13:28.241 --> 13:30.143
CHIP:
Alba!

13:30.177 --> 13:32.679
Hey, Garfield, nap time's over.

13:32.712 --> 13:35.148
-Did you not hear me calling
your name? -I heard you.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.950
All right, well,
I spilled a bunch of Bolognese

13:36.984 --> 13:38.518
in the upstairs hallway, so I'm
gonna need you to mop that up.

13:38.551 --> 13:39.987
Oh, I don't think I'll be

13:40.020 --> 13:41.554
mopping meat sauces anymore.

13:41.588 --> 13:44.124
You know, Chip,
I got to thinking about

13:44.157 --> 13:46.059
your gym class story,
and it doesn't add up.

13:46.093 --> 13:49.296
Chip, a bully?
No.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.730
Chip is a coward.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.532
So I call your school,

13:52.565 --> 13:54.534
and they said
you signed yourself out

13:54.567 --> 13:57.470
after an incident
in the boys' locker room.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.406
Uh, yeah.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.142
'Cause I was just ripping
on that pube-less loser so bad

14:02.175 --> 14:05.078
that I just wanted to get out of
there, give him time to recover.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.813
Okay. That makes sense.

14:06.846 --> 14:10.583
Oh, eh, but one more thing.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.819
You know, I am your maid,
so I clean your room.

14:12.852 --> 14:16.323
And I find something
very interesting.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.525
I don't know what that is.
What is that? Give it to me

14:18.558 --> 14:22.362
-right now. -You know,
at first, I thought to myself,

14:22.395 --> 14:24.164
what is this?
Is it a key ring,

14:24.197 --> 14:27.400
or some sort of school project
that I am not aware of?

14:27.434 --> 14:29.236
What do you think it is?

14:29.269 --> 14:32.705
-I-I-I have no idea.
-Hmm.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.341
A mystery.

14:34.374 --> 14:38.445
-Well, I guess I will just
have to burn it. -No!

14:38.478 --> 14:40.513
Please don't!
I spent a fortune on that thing.

14:40.547 --> 14:41.714
That's Arabian horse hair.

14:41.748 --> 14:43.683
Ha! Then you do admit it.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.353
Fine! I admit it!

14:46.386 --> 14:48.588
Okay, I am smooth
as a frickin' dolphin!

14:48.621 --> 14:51.291
Is that what you wanted to hear?
Are you happy now?!

14:51.324 --> 14:54.594
No.
I want you to fire Dagoberto,

14:54.627 --> 14:57.397
or this ends up
at the top of the flagpole,

14:57.430 --> 14:59.766
and your whole school will
be pledging allegiance

14:59.799 --> 15:01.301
to your little penis wig.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.040
Disgusting.

15:07.074 --> 15:08.976
(teacher speaking German)

15:17.985 --> 15:19.252
Whew.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.821
(whispering):
Hey, what class is this?

15:21.854 --> 15:23.123
(speaking German)

15:23.156 --> 15:24.924
Deutsch drei.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.393
What? (laughs)

15:26.426 --> 15:28.128
Was that English?
What are you saying?

15:28.161 --> 15:30.430
(speaks German)

15:30.463 --> 15:31.631
Bitch.

15:31.664 --> 15:34.101
Hey. Psst. Where am I?

15:34.134 --> 15:35.435
(speaks German)

15:35.468 --> 15:36.803
Nor Deutsch, fräulein.

15:36.836 --> 15:39.172
Oh. Please, dear God help me.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.907
(speaks German)

15:40.940 --> 15:42.976
(repeats German phrase)

15:43.010 --> 15:44.177
-(teacher speaks German)
-Hmm?

15:44.211 --> 15:46.813
-(Sabrina groans)
-(speaks German)

15:46.846 --> 15:50.450
Mm-hmm, you're right.
I don't speak your language.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.119
But I am a good person.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.854
I mean well.
I've been abandoned.

15:54.887 --> 15:56.723
(speaking German)

16:03.963 --> 16:07.134
All right, come on.
Let's go see Principal Gibbons.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.268
-(P.A. chimes)
-MICKEY: Let go!

16:08.301 --> 16:09.702
SECRETARY:
Ma'am, it's for office use only.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.038
MICKEY:
Give it to me!

16:11.071 --> 16:13.640
(clears throat) Now could
I please have the attention

16:13.673 --> 16:15.275
-of one student?
-(laughs)

16:15.308 --> 16:16.776
Everyone else stop listening.

16:16.809 --> 16:17.810
Shh!

16:17.844 --> 16:19.979
Please meet me a-at the closet

16:20.013 --> 16:21.514
where we mixed the colors

16:21.548 --> 16:23.450
and began the journey
to discover ourselves.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.484
I remember.

16:24.517 --> 16:25.985
May God be with you.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.354
Oh, Mickey.

16:31.924 --> 16:33.526
You wanted to see me, Mr. Chip?

16:33.560 --> 16:36.896
Y-Yeah. Uh, I...

16:36.929 --> 16:39.399
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.234
We're-we're gonna...

16:41.268 --> 16:43.303
we're gonna have to let you go.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.871
(gasps) What?

16:44.904 --> 16:47.374
But why?
Wh-What-what did I do wrong?

16:47.407 --> 16:50.043
You're straight up
just bad at your job.

16:50.077 --> 16:51.844
Please, just give me
another chance.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.980
I'll work ten times harder,
a thousand times.

16:54.013 --> 16:54.981
Yes, have some compassion.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.416
He was just trying to learn.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.551
I can teach him.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.053
Well...

17:00.087 --> 17:02.055
I mean, I guess, I guess
we could work some...

17:03.623 --> 17:05.692
No.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.427
My mind is made up.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.761
The decision is final.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.697
Ay, that is tough.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.299
I'm so sorry, primo.

17:13.933 --> 17:17.770
Wow. That took cajones, Chip.

17:17.804 --> 17:21.308
Perfectly smooth cajones.
(laughs)

17:24.544 --> 17:26.713
When did you stop
hearing the music?

17:26.746 --> 17:27.847
-Oh! Oh.
-Oh!

17:27.880 --> 17:29.216
-Sorry!
-It's okay.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.684
-Oh.
-It's okay. I'm okay.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.121
-You found me.
-Am I bleeding?

17:34.154 --> 17:37.690
Yeah, but it's really red
and so beautiful.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.192
Thank you so much
for saying that.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.428
(laughs) Let's get
the hell out of here.

17:41.461 --> 17:42.895
-Yes, please.
-Yeah.

17:45.098 --> 17:46.533
No way. What language
were they speaking?

17:46.566 --> 17:48.201
-I don't know,
but it wasn't human. -Whoa.

17:48.235 --> 17:50.937
-And then you saved me.
-I'm very brave.

17:50.970 --> 17:53.273
-Yeah, we're both incredible.
Unstoppable. -Yeah.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.541
I mean, we can do anything.

17:54.574 --> 17:55.708
-Listen.
-What?

17:55.742 --> 17:57.944
-I'm gonna get back
into my music, okay? -Yes.

17:57.977 --> 17:59.779
Really start getting lit up
and going to shows.

17:59.812 --> 18:01.314
Yes! What time is it?

18:01.348 --> 18:02.815
It's time to stop
messing around,

18:02.849 --> 18:04.251
and really give this thing a go.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.052
No, no, what time is it,
like on a clock?

18:06.085 --> 18:09.055
Oh. Yeah. 2:30. Why?

18:09.088 --> 18:10.990
-My Yale interview!
-Your Yale interview!

18:11.023 --> 18:12.959
-I'm gonna do it.
-No. Not now.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.294
No.

18:15.495 --> 18:16.596
No!

18:16.629 --> 18:17.597
-Sabrina...
-You can't stop what's supposed

18:17.630 --> 18:19.899
to happen, Mickey!

18:19.932 --> 18:23.102
Hi. Sabrina Pemberton, I am here
for the Yale interview.

18:23.136 --> 18:26.673
Ms. Pemberton, I was beginning
to think you weren't coming.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.975
Hi. Mickey. Mackenzie. Molng.

18:29.008 --> 18:30.977
I-I should be here, right?
I feel like I should be here.

18:31.010 --> 18:33.846
Generally, we like to talk
to prospective students alone.

18:33.880 --> 18:37.116
We'll have her back
to you in no time.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.585
Oh, she's good.
You don't need me.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.952
She doesn't need me.

18:39.986 --> 18:44.023
No one needs me.
I'm alone. Oh, no. Um...

18:53.733 --> 18:57.003
Oh, no. Here we go.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.808
(elephant trumpets)

19:01.841 --> 19:04.143
(animals chattering)

19:34.441 --> 19:35.475
DEVIN:
Play.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.510
I-I...

19:37.544 --> 19:39.812
I don't know if I can.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.048
I mean, I-I-I've been
to a lot of shows.

19:44.083 --> 19:45.618
Play.

20:04.804 --> 20:08.375
(playing "No Rain"
by Blind Melon)

20:38.638 --> 20:41.308
My essay, it-it was
nothing more than lies.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.876
A fairy tale about
a self-assured little girl

20:43.910 --> 20:45.978
who pretends to know
exactly what she wants

20:46.012 --> 20:47.079
and where she's going.

20:47.113 --> 20:48.915
Nope.

20:48.948 --> 20:52.785
But the truth is that I-I don't
know who I am or what I want.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.754
It's not important.
What is important

20:54.787 --> 20:57.657
is the experience
of figuring those things out.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.831
(playing tunelessly)

21:09.302 --> 21:11.137
Mickey. Mickey!

21:11.170 --> 21:13.606
-Hmm?
-What the hell are you doing?

21:13.640 --> 21:14.874
Oh, Devin encouraged me to...

21:17.877 --> 21:19.846
Nothing. What are you doing?

21:19.879 --> 21:21.280
Oh, I'm gonna go to Yale.

21:21.314 --> 21:23.583
-(gasps)
-But because I decided to.

21:23.616 --> 21:26.786
Good for you.
I became a musician.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.588
You absolutely did not.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.358
* All I can say

21:31.391 --> 21:33.826
* Is that my life
is pretty plain... *

21:33.860 --> 21:36.162
I actually feel like
I'm starting to come down.

21:36.195 --> 21:39.599
How about you? Not as bad
as Foxboro, right?

21:39.632 --> 21:41.768
You good to drive?

21:41.801 --> 21:43.503
* And all I can do

21:43.536 --> 21:47.106
-Yep. -* Is just pour
some tea for two *

21:47.139 --> 21:48.875
* And speak my point...

21:50.877 --> 21:52.445
-MICKEY: Am I bleeding?
-SABRINA: Yeah.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.414

Media Access Group at WGBH

21:56.649 --> 21:58.618
Hope you
enjoyed
kickin' it
with The Mick.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.887
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

22:03.255 --> 22:04.824
It's time we fly
this old bird.

22:04.857 --> 22:07.794
* It feels good *

22:07.827 --> 22:10.697
MULDER: I want to believe.
I would just like to see.

22:10.730 --> 22:11.498
I can help you.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.500
* It feels good *

22:13.533 --> 22:15.134
-You want to do
the honors, Alan?
-Yeah!

22:15.167 --> 22:16.503
No, you never
touch this.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.304
* You know it feels good *

22:18.337 --> 22:19.906
-(shrieks)
-* It feels good *

22:19.939 --> 22:21.874
* Oh, you know it feels good *

22:21.908 --> 22:23.976
Let's do it.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.278
Everything you thought
you knew about medicine
is wrong.

22:29.416 --> 22:30.349
Unbelievable.

22:30.383 --> 22:31.951
* It feels good *
