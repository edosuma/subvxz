03:22.000 --> 03:23.950
Leondina, what's the matter?

03:24.960 --> 03:28.910
Look, it's Jesus!
Where are they going?

03:56.920 --> 03:59.870
Where are you taking
the statue?

04:03.760 --> 04:07.710
- What?
- Where are you taking it?

04:14.200 --> 04:16.550
They're taking it to the Pope!

04:19.560 --> 04:22.510
He wants the phone number! No!

05:16.800 --> 05:19.150
Hey, you, come here, please.

05:20.160 --> 05:23.030
What did they eat at table N° 16?

05:23.120 --> 05:25.070
The prince ate snails.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.670
- What wine?
- Soave.

05:28.320 --> 05:33.710
- No, Valpolicella! Hi, Marcello!
- Hi.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.870
Snails and Valpolicella.
Let me take a picture.

05:37.960 --> 05:40.070
It's not possible!

05:40.160 --> 05:44.110
Why do you pay him?
I give out information!

06:02.640 --> 06:06.590
Manager, stop that photographer!

06:08.880 --> 06:14.150
- Give me the film!
- Oh, come on!

06:16.040 --> 06:17.990
A light.

06:28.720 --> 06:31.830
- Listen, honey, come here.
- Me?

06:31.920 --> 06:35.870
- I'm talking to you. - What's
the matter? - I must talk to you.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.950
Good evening, how are you?

06:40.960 --> 06:44.470
- Sit down.
- There's no chair.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.120
- Squat down!
- Sorry.

06:48.480 --> 06:51.040
- Naughty!
- Why?

06:51.120 --> 06:53.070
You're naughty.

06:53.640 --> 06:56.590
And I'll break your little face!

06:57.640 --> 07:02.310
Just a little publicity.

07:02.400 --> 07:05.790
You got her into trouble
with her husband.

07:05.880 --> 07:09.150
Do I worry
about your being cuckold?

07:09.240 --> 07:12.630
- You're not a journalist.
- Great journalism!

07:12.720 --> 07:17.350
- Shut up! Be careful!
- You'll kill me!

07:28.960 --> 07:31.630
- Has he arrived?
- Not yet.

07:31.720 --> 07:35.150
Tell him he's an idiot!
Whisky!

07:37.840 --> 07:40.400
This place is unbearable!

08:25.720 --> 08:29.870
Good evening, Maddalena.
Alone? Want to dance?

08:29.960 --> 08:31.910
No.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.630
Want to drink some Vodka?

08:34.720 --> 08:38.190
No. Everything's wrong tonight.
I'm leaving.

08:38.280 --> 08:42.230
- Can I accompany you?
- I don't know...

09:05.480 --> 09:10.110
- Your friends.
- Marcello, where are you going?

09:10.200 --> 09:12.950
- Miss Maddalena!
- Leave me alone tonight!

09:13.040 --> 09:16.790
Welcome back!
More beautiful than a star!

09:16.880 --> 09:19.910
Always the same song.
They never change?

09:20.000 --> 09:24.940
Paparazzo, stop it!
You're a public figure!

09:25.040 --> 09:28.110
Marcello, where are you going?

09:41.480 --> 09:44.470
I'd like to live in a new city.

09:44.560 --> 09:46.670
I like Rome very much.

09:46.760 --> 09:51.470
It's a jungle
where one can hide well.

09:54.120 --> 09:57.070
I'd like to hide too, but I can't.

10:01.480 --> 10:05.430
- What'll we do?
- Take a ride.

10:11.240 --> 10:16.310
- I'm fed up with Rome! I'd like
an island. - If you buy one.

10:16.400 --> 10:21.340
I considered the possibility.
Would I really go there?

10:22.720 --> 10:26.030
Your problem is
you have too much money.

10:26.120 --> 10:29.070
Your problem is
you don't have enough.

10:30.680 --> 10:33.630
Meanwhile here we are,
the two of us.

10:33.720 --> 10:38.470
That's not a problem. We're among
the few people to be unhappy.

10:38.560 --> 10:41.630
- What did you do here?
- Nothing.

10:41.720 --> 10:45.950
You're so rich, if you fall,
you'll land standing up.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.500
- You think so?
- Sure.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.950
I can't even stand up!

10:51.880 --> 10:54.950
I need an enthusiastic push.

10:55.920 --> 10:59.700
When I make love there's tension.

10:59.800 --> 11:03.750
- Only love gives me strength.
- Long live love!

11:04.720 --> 11:06.670
Annamaria, look here!

11:07.240 --> 11:09.800
That car looks like an apartment!

11:09.880 --> 11:13.990
- Are you Liliana?
- I'm not Liliana.

11:14.080 --> 11:16.830
- And who are you?
- Good evening.

11:16.920 --> 11:20.460
- Good evening.
- Who are you talking to?

11:20.560 --> 11:22.510
Who's there?

11:22.600 --> 11:25.870
Liliana went to Milan.

11:25.960 --> 11:28.830
- Are you coming with us?
- Me?

11:28.920 --> 11:31.750
Yes... you, come with us.

11:33.560 --> 11:37.510
She says if I go with her.
Should I?

11:39.280 --> 11:41.870
Let's take a ride with this girl.

11:41.960 --> 11:44.110
What do you want to do?

11:44.200 --> 11:48.510
Nothing. I'll take her home.
You know her?

11:48.600 --> 11:52.270
No. I don't think so.

11:54.160 --> 11:57.150
I'm going to eat.
I'll see you there.

11:57.240 --> 11:59.800
Turn off the lights, fanatic!

12:03.440 --> 12:06.110
Get paid.
They're richer than Onassis.

12:09.480 --> 12:14.670
- Are you coming? - If you
take me home, I'd appreciate it.

12:14.760 --> 12:17.710
- Are you coming?
- Nope.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.910
But I live far.

12:22.600 --> 12:25.550
- Sit on the back.
- Thanks.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.830
- Are you okay there? - Yes.
- Bye! - Bye, Annamaria.

12:30.920 --> 12:34.870
- Where do you live?
- At Cessati Spiriti.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.470
- Is that your car?
- Yes.

12:48.400 --> 12:51.750
- Did you buy it for her?
- Her father.

12:51.840 --> 12:55.310
All my father gave me
were beatings!

12:55.400 --> 12:59.390
- Do you know my father?
- You introduced him to me.

12:59.480 --> 13:02.270
Where do your parents live?

13:02.360 --> 13:06.830
- In Cesena.
- Is there the sea? - No.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.870
Well, how is it going?

13:09.440 --> 13:11.790
So, so...

13:13.320 --> 13:15.470
Things didn't go well tonight?

13:15.560 --> 13:19.310
A truffle gave me
1,000 lira and cigarettes.

13:20.360 --> 13:25.300
- Was he young or old?
- I didn't look at him in the face!

13:29.440 --> 13:33.430
- Would you go with a woman
like this one? - No.

13:33.520 --> 13:37.300
Why?
She's not worse than many others.

13:37.400 --> 13:41.950
- You don't go with women
like this? - Yes, sometimes.

13:42.840 --> 13:48.670
Listen, Gregory Peck... I'd like
to know something. What'll we do?

13:48.760 --> 13:53.430
- We'll take you home, okay?
- Yes.

13:54.840 --> 13:59.780
- Why? What did you think?
- Me, nothing!

14:09.040 --> 14:12.510
We'll wake everyone up.
Turn off the radio!

14:12.600 --> 14:16.220
- We'll leave immediately.
- Is someone home?

14:16.320 --> 14:19.390
- What's she saying?
- If someone is home.

14:19.480 --> 14:25.150
- No, my cousin is in Velletri.
- Will you offer us some coffee?

14:26.240 --> 14:28.830
Gladly. I make good coffee.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.550
Don't expect a palace!

14:39.120 --> 14:41.070
I'll lead the way.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.230
The coffee.

15:14.600 --> 15:19.270
Watch out for the stairs.
The other evening a man...

15:19.360 --> 15:24.710
Darn! It's flooded again!

15:25.360 --> 15:27.430
Wait a moment.

15:27.520 --> 15:31.630
"The engineer!"
He should have been a grave-digger!

15:31.720 --> 15:36.510
That'll be the day! I've been
absolving all the devil's sins!

15:37.720 --> 15:39.670
Damn!

15:42.560 --> 15:46.100
I'll take you to the bedroom.

15:47.720 --> 15:51.830
It's flooded here too.
I'll make some coffee.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.830
Some recommendation is needed.

15:54.920 --> 15:59.860
- I made a request two years ago
but... - Don't worry.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.480
I make some coffee, okay?

16:14.120 --> 16:16.070
Would you close the door?

16:32.800 --> 16:34.750
You want to make love here?

16:36.120 --> 16:38.070
No?

17:03.760 --> 17:05.710
I'll leave your coffee here.

17:12.319 --> 17:15.790
You didn't agree before?
Are you crazy?

17:15.880 --> 17:21.349
They did everything!
I hope they give me 2,000 lira!

17:21.440 --> 17:24.470
2,000? I set the price!

17:24.560 --> 17:28.510
- Are they husband and wife?
- Oh, come on!

18:00.600 --> 18:04.510
Here. Many thanks.
Must I back up?

18:04.600 --> 18:09.030
No. Turn right at the end.
Can I give you a little kiss?

18:09.120 --> 18:13.870
- Thanks. Come back when you want!
- Bye.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.910
Slow down with that car!

18:39.520 --> 18:42.470
Oh, my God!

19:12.680 --> 19:14.630
Emma!

19:16.080 --> 19:21.790
Emma! Emma!
Emma, answer, what happened?

19:29.480 --> 19:33.020
What did you do? Crazy fool!

19:47.600 --> 19:50.060
Emma!

19:50.160 --> 19:55.150
It's nothing. Keep calm!
I'll take you to the hospital.

19:55.240 --> 19:58.030
Why are you so crazy?

19:58.120 --> 20:01.470
You want to ruin me, huh?

20:01.560 --> 20:04.910
One day I'll just let you die!

20:08.160 --> 20:11.310
Emma... stop it now.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.750
Emma, darling...

20:24.160 --> 20:26.620
My love... Emma...

20:32.040 --> 20:33.990
Hurry up!

20:44.240 --> 20:47.630
Did you bring that woman
that poisoned herself?

20:47.720 --> 20:50.550
Giannelli,
don't write anything, please.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.750
I'll get involved with the police.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.710
What happened?
What is her name?

20:55.800 --> 20:58.670
I can't tell you.
Leave me alone.

20:58.760 --> 21:01.830
- You can come in.
- Thanks.

21:12.120 --> 21:16.270
- Emma!
- Don't tire her. She must rest.

21:18.960 --> 21:21.260
In two hours
you can take her back home.

21:21.360 --> 21:24.230
Go to the brigadier for the report.
It's obligatory.

21:24.320 --> 21:26.270
Emma!

21:33.880 --> 21:39.550
Emma, why did you do it? Why?

21:50.640 --> 21:52.590
The brigadier is waiting for you.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.990
I'll be right back.

22:09.280 --> 22:11.430
Wait, he'll be right in.

22:24.200 --> 22:28.150
- Sister, can I use the phone?
- Sure.

23:18.840 --> 23:22.790
- You can't stay here!
- I just want to take a picture!

24:05.480 --> 24:07.430
Take your glasses off.

24:44.600 --> 24:47.590
The producer Toto Scalise
has just arrived.

24:47.680 --> 24:51.870
He's signed up the star
for a great picture.

24:51.960 --> 24:53.950
Is it the Swedish woman?

24:54.040 --> 24:57.030
I'd better not see her,
otherwise I'll kill my wife!

24:57.120 --> 24:59.230
Long live Sweden!

24:59.320 --> 25:06.470
The beautiful Swedish actress
tastes a typical Italian product,

25:06.560 --> 25:11.580
which is as colourful
and joyful as our country.

25:11.680 --> 25:14.710
Hi, Marcello,
great piece of meat, huh?

25:14.800 --> 25:18.750
Toto Scalise is leading the star
through the customs...

25:45.320 --> 25:48.790
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes, thank you.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.830
What a confusion!

26:07.120 --> 26:09.990
- Come on Marcello, pass him!
- Stop it!

26:10.080 --> 26:14.030
I want to take a picture!
Pass him!

26:22.160 --> 26:25.110
Is it true you always bathe in ice?

26:40.040 --> 26:43.230
Which Italian historical figure
would you like to play?

26:43.320 --> 26:45.670
Do you like bearded men?

26:50.760 --> 26:53.710
What do you think
about Italian actresses?

27:20.480 --> 27:25.190
Do you think Italian Neo-realism
is dead or alive?

27:25.280 --> 27:28.230
Do you believe
in friendship among peoples?

27:49.720 --> 27:52.830
I couldn't call you before. Thanks.

27:56.640 --> 28:01.390
I'm working, dear.
Did you take your medicine?

28:01.480 --> 28:06.710
- Are you alone with her?
- There are at least 50 people!

28:06.800 --> 28:12.750
- Swear on your mother's life!
- Yes, I swear on my mother.

28:14.080 --> 28:17.750
Beautiful
if you like American beauty.

28:17.840 --> 28:20.430
She's like a big doll!

28:45.360 --> 28:47.310
Yes.

28:47.880 --> 28:51.070
I'll come there
and rip your eyes out!

28:51.160 --> 28:55.110
Marcello, why don't you
come here immediately?

28:55.200 --> 28:57.950
- I can't!
- I want to make love.

28:58.040 --> 29:00.070
- Pardon me?
- I want to make love!

29:02.920 --> 29:05.300
Where shall we take her?

29:05.400 --> 29:08.350
First to St. Peter's,
then to the Quirinale.

29:13.240 --> 29:15.190
Here's our Robert!

29:25.520 --> 29:29.350
- Marcello?
- What! Are you going out today?

29:29.440 --> 29:34.030
No, I'll wait for you
all day at home.

29:34.120 --> 29:39.510
What would you like to eat?
Something light. You want ravioli?

29:40.280 --> 29:43.980
I've got everything.
I'll just go down for vegetables.

29:44.080 --> 29:47.390
Then we'll go to the movies.
Whatever you want.

29:47.480 --> 29:49.430
Marcello, do you love me?

30:10.840 --> 30:12.790
Don't leave her alone!

30:44.240 --> 30:47.190
Wait, I take one more picture!

30:50.240 --> 30:52.190
She never stops a minute!

31:06.840 --> 31:09.790
I finished the film.
I'll be right back.

31:17.240 --> 31:21.190
- Where did she go?
- She's an elevator!

33:07.040 --> 33:10.230
Sylvia, you know you're everything?

33:14.320 --> 33:17.670
You're the first woman of creation.

33:18.440 --> 33:21.470
You're mother, sister,
lover, friend,

33:21.560 --> 33:24.230
an angel, a devil,
the earth, the home.

33:24.320 --> 33:27.270
That's what you are: the home!

33:33.240 --> 33:35.190
Why did you come here?

33:36.400 --> 33:41.340
Go back to America, please.
What will I do now?

33:57.240 --> 34:00.670
Our Robert is even a painter.
Bravo!

34:00.760 --> 34:04.710
I must see you!
I must talk to you at all costs!

34:23.080 --> 34:27.030
- Who's that idiot?
- Frankie Stout, a divine actor!

34:57.240 --> 34:58.590
Please.

35:17.720 --> 35:21.670
- Will you excuse me a moment?
- Go, honey, go!

35:23.360 --> 35:25.310
He's dancing with the lady!

36:55.600 --> 36:57.550
Hi, darling.

37:07.040 --> 37:10.820
He's a good dancer, very good!

37:12.480 --> 37:14.710
Banana flambé, huh?

37:14.800 --> 37:17.870
- The lady's shoes.
- I'll take them, thank you.

37:17.960 --> 37:20.830
- I found them...
- That's fine, thank you.

37:20.920 --> 37:23.590
Excuse me... one moment.

37:47.640 --> 37:50.590
- What do you want?
- Some rock music!

40:05.320 --> 40:08.390
Good! Bravo! Divine!

40:11.600 --> 40:13.550
Good!

40:16.320 --> 40:21.830
Thank you, madam.
You're divine!

40:21.920 --> 40:23.870
Thank you, sir!

40:27.000 --> 40:28.950
Marcello, open the champagne!

40:36.040 --> 40:37.390
Thanks.

41:19.160 --> 41:22.860
I don't know.
I'll bring her back immediately.

41:22.960 --> 41:25.670
Give me the shoes.
I'll be right back.

41:25.760 --> 41:29.350
- Why did she get upset?
- Stay here. I'll take care of it.

41:29.440 --> 41:32.000
- Here she is!
- Sylvia! - Sylvia!

41:32.080 --> 41:34.460
- Sylvia, the shoes!
- Marcello, what happened?

41:34.560 --> 41:36.510
Nothing happened. Go away!

41:38.720 --> 41:40.670
Marcello, wait!

41:41.400 --> 41:43.350
Great idea, Marcello!

41:51.000 --> 41:53.270
Paparazzo, get out of the car!

41:53.360 --> 41:56.790
Incredible scoop.
I'll give you 50 percent.

41:56.880 --> 42:01.820
I don't give a damn
about the 50 percent. Get out!

42:04.120 --> 42:05.550
Get lost!

42:05.640 --> 42:08.830
Marcello,
tell me where you're going!

42:08.920 --> 42:10.870
Hurry. Let's follow them!

42:30.840 --> 42:32.790
We lost them.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.550
Yes... no... of course!

43:47.720 --> 43:49.670
What?

44:15.880 --> 44:17.830
It's full of holes there!

44:35.640 --> 44:37.590
We'd better leave.

44:45.800 --> 44:49.790
Sergio will be back on the 12th.
I'm his mother.

44:49.880 --> 44:54.470
- Do you have the studio key?
- No, he takes it with him.

44:54.560 --> 44:56.790
I'm his mother. Was it for work?

44:56.880 --> 45:01.350
Yes, for work...

45:01.440 --> 45:04.350
I'll call on the 12th.
It doesn't matter.

45:04.440 --> 45:06.390
Excuse me, madam. Goodnight.

45:09.680 --> 45:13.870
- Excuse me, isn't she
the American actress? - Yes.

45:13.960 --> 45:15.910
- How beautiful!
- Goodnight.

45:26.280 --> 45:31.830
I can't bring you home.
The madwoman wouldn't understand.

45:31.920 --> 45:33.870
Un-der-stand?

45:34.760 --> 45:36.710
Wait. I've got an idea!

45:39.760 --> 45:44.110
- Miss, a phone call for you.
- Hello?

45:45.760 --> 45:49.670
Marcello! Sure you don't have
the wrong number?

45:49.760 --> 45:52.470
Can I come with someone?

45:52.560 --> 45:56.390
Someone? Who?

45:56.480 --> 45:58.430
Someone!

45:59.800 --> 46:04.190
- You're not alone?
- I'm playing cards with my father.

46:06.200 --> 46:09.950
- Your father's there?
- Tell me...

46:11.120 --> 46:13.270
What do you want?

46:13.360 --> 46:16.550
Nothing.
I'll call you soon. Goodnight.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.950
Sylvia, what are you doing?

46:42.280 --> 46:45.230
Where can I find milk
at this hour?

46:48.880 --> 46:52.150
Sylvia!
Where are you going with that cat?

46:52.240 --> 46:54.990
Come here. Stop!

46:56.200 --> 46:58.190
Come on!

46:58.280 --> 47:01.820
I'll go get the milk.
Wait in the car.

47:03.680 --> 47:06.630
I'm going... go!

47:15.920 --> 47:19.700
Excuse me,
where can I buy some milk?

47:19.800 --> 47:21.750
It doesn't matter...

48:53.480 --> 48:55.430
Yes, I'm coming too...

48:57.080 --> 48:59.030
I'm coming too!

49:03.200 --> 49:06.550
Yes, you're right.
I'm making a mistake.

49:06.640 --> 49:08.590
We're making a mistake!

49:21.680 --> 49:23.630
Sylvia, who are you?

49:59.760 --> 50:02.870
Turn him...

50:05.760 --> 50:08.190
And to think he did Tarzan.

50:08.280 --> 50:10.230
Put him back.

50:15.760 --> 50:18.790
I'll take this one from the mirror.

50:18.880 --> 50:21.830
I'll take one
while you're photographing him.

50:23.720 --> 50:25.670
Here's Marcello!

50:30.720 --> 50:32.670
Hey, wake up!

50:44.200 --> 50:47.430
- Do me a favour. Leave!
- But I've got to work!

50:47.520 --> 50:49.470
Enough!

50:51.320 --> 50:53.270
Enough!

51:00.480 --> 51:03.430
This will end up in a fight!

51:28.480 --> 51:31.110
Follow her, Mr. Robert!

51:31.720 --> 51:33.670
It's not over yet.

51:50.960 --> 51:53.190
Marcello, hit him too, no?

51:53.280 --> 51:56.950
Marcello, raise your head a bit!

51:57.040 --> 52:00.630
Mr. Robert, where are you going?
Marcello, what happened?

52:05.160 --> 52:08.860
Marcello!
It's done. Now what do I do?

52:10.040 --> 52:14.980
Put the horse on the table,
and her on the ground.

52:19.920 --> 52:25.830
- I'll be right back. - Are you
coming out with me tonight?

52:43.920 --> 52:48.510
I thought I saw you enter. How are
you? What are you doing here?

52:48.600 --> 52:52.140
And you?
I'm happy to see you again.

52:53.280 --> 52:55.230
I'm at home here.

52:56.360 --> 53:01.220
Father Franz found this book for me.

53:01.320 --> 53:03.670
It's an old Sanskrit grammar book.

53:05.720 --> 53:09.070
How long! How's your book?

53:10.160 --> 53:13.510
It's going.
I finished gathering the material.

53:13.600 --> 53:17.030
I thought I'd let you read it.
And you?

53:17.120 --> 53:20.070
I liked your recent
article very much.

53:21.120 --> 53:25.110
- No.
- Why? It was fine.

53:27.320 --> 53:31.590
It was vivid, passionate...
the best of you.

53:31.680 --> 53:34.990
A quality you insist on hiding.

53:35.080 --> 53:37.870
I don't think I know how to write.

53:37.960 --> 53:41.910
Why don't you come
some evening to see me?

53:42.640 --> 53:46.590
- Can you stay another
five minutes? - Sure.

53:48.240 --> 53:51.270
- Father, can I come up
with a friend? - Yes. Come on!

53:51.360 --> 53:54.150
- Are you sure?
- Come on!

53:54.240 --> 53:59.670
As you see,
these priests don't fear the devil.

53:59.760 --> 54:02.710
They even let me play the organ.

54:03.560 --> 54:05.710
Don't be too noisy.

54:05.800 --> 54:10.270
Don't worry.
You'll hear some jazz at the most.

54:10.360 --> 54:12.710
If It's jazz, I like it.

54:15.720 --> 54:17.670
Sorry, I won't do it again.

54:18.880 --> 54:20.830
You want to try, Marcello?

54:28.080 --> 54:31.070
We're not used to hearing it.
Anymore.

54:31.160 --> 54:35.230
Mysterious voice. It seems
to come from inside the earth.

54:35.320 --> 54:38.270
- What song?
- You choose?

55:52.360 --> 55:55.310
Where is it?
At the end of a wall?

55:55.400 --> 55:57.390
Hey, paparazzo!

55:57.480 --> 56:00.430
They told me at the 47th kilometre.

56:03.240 --> 56:05.990
- I don't want an egg at this hour!
- Eat it.

56:06.080 --> 56:08.030
- No!
- Eat it!

56:09.960 --> 56:12.190
- Chew slowly!
- Yes.

56:12.280 --> 56:17.630
We should have come yesterday.
It'll be full of photographers.

56:17.720 --> 56:22.660
- Do you have some coffee?
- Marcello needs it!

56:23.160 --> 56:25.750
I don't want a banana!

56:25.840 --> 56:28.790
- I don't want it!
- Eat it!

56:31.560 --> 56:33.510
- Chew slowly!
- Yes!

56:42.040 --> 56:43.990
- The Madonna's children?
- Yes!

56:45.400 --> 56:50.340
- Where is the miracle tree?
- Over there!

57:08.520 --> 57:10.470
Stay here.
There's too much confusion.

57:16.240 --> 57:19.780
Norman! Stay here! Norman!

57:24.200 --> 57:26.150
Where are the children?

57:26.240 --> 57:28.700
Locked up
in the carabineers' headquarters.

57:28.800 --> 57:33.110
Take me with you.
I'll tell you about the Communists.

57:33.200 --> 57:37.150
- Where is the miracle tree?
- Over there.

57:38.880 --> 57:45.140
Damned them!
Damned them!

57:53.000 --> 57:57.070
Free those creatures.
It's an abuse!

58:10.080 --> 58:12.350
- Where?
- This way!

58:12.440 --> 58:15.000
- Where are the children?
- I don't know.

58:15.080 --> 58:18.030
- Where is the marshal?
- Who knows.

58:23.280 --> 58:27.430
What about the 500 lira that you
received by that journalist?

58:27.520 --> 58:30.910
Can I go home, brigadier?

58:33.960 --> 58:37.190
I'll feel shaky
the rest of my life!

58:37.280 --> 58:39.230
Yes, I understand...

58:42.920 --> 58:44.870
Look over there.

58:53.040 --> 58:55.110
The grandfather's here too!

58:55.200 --> 58:58.670
- What are the children's names?
- Dario... - Pardon me?

58:58.760 --> 59:01.590
- Dario and Maria.
- Dario and Maria. Great!

59:01.680 --> 59:03.270
Good, cry!

59:03.360 --> 59:07.390
It's a miracle.
The Madonna remembers everyone!

59:07.480 --> 59:11.310
- Do I look good like this?
- You're perfect!

59:11.400 --> 59:14.350
- The cigar?
- Sing first.

59:18.160 --> 59:21.150
- Then It's not a miracle?
- I don't believe it.

59:21.240 --> 59:27.190
The Lord can do it anywhere,
but they are very rare events.

59:27.280 --> 59:30.630
Those youngsters aren't honest.

59:30.720 --> 59:35.840
Who sees the Madonna
doesn't speculate on her!

59:35.920 --> 59:41.710
Miracles are born out of silence
not in this confusion!

59:42.240 --> 59:47.360
- Who did you see next to the tree?
- The Madonna.

59:47.440 --> 59:50.270
- Who saw her first?
- I did! - I did!

59:50.360 --> 59:55.350
- Simultaneously!
- No, he saw her first!

59:55.440 --> 59:57.390
They are my nephews.

59:57.480 --> 01:00:02.550
The Madonna looked at us and smiled.
Her feet didn't touch the ground.

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.670
Did she tell you
she was the Madonna?

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.790
They don't want to believe it!

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.180
Could it really
have been the Madonna?

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.230
It doesn't matter.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.550
What do you mean?
Why do you say that?

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.630
Yes, it doesn't matter.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:24.840
Your Italy is filled
with supernatural forces.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.630
Everyone feels their influence.

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.750
He who looks for God,
finds him where he wants.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.990
Did you come for a miracle too?

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:37.630
No, I'm with my fiancée.
He's a journalist.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.550
All these people frighten me.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.590
You stay here. And don't laugh!

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:52.030
Higher!

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:55.590
I made a mistake.
Get down!

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.980
Let's try the children's scene!

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:03.150
The children are smaller.
Can you see me?

01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:05.510
Come on! Hurry up!

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.390
Hurry up!

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:13.470
- Here's my fiancée.
- Fine. - I'll be right back.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.590
Ready? Go!

01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:21.630
Speak up!
Why don't you pray?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.620
It's7 p.m.
We'll meet in 2 hours.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:33.470
Thank you.
See you this evening.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:51.190
Holy Madonna,
make this creature get well.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:54.230
I ask you with all my soul!

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.310
Marcello...

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:10.710
Don't worry.
The Madonna hears us. She's good!

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:48.390
A large crowd
has gathered in this area.

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.310
Many are believers,
many are curious.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.790
Among the curious,
journalists, photo reporters

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:58.150
from papers all over the world.

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:01.310
There is an innumerable number
of cars piled up.

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:06.070
The weather is nice
after so much rain.

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:09.030
The two children
are still held by the police.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:12.030
We await further word from Rome.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:15.710
We're interviewing
the children's uncle.

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:22.140
The first time they saw...
the miracle?

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:30.750
They first saw the Madonna
on March 15 of... next year.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.910
- You mean this year.
- This year.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.230
Permission from Rome arrived.
The children are coming!

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:42.310
- Really? - Yes, they are coming.
- The children are coming!

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:46.790
- Stay here... I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:48.990
- I'm going up there.
- I'm coming too.

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:52.830
No, stay here with the lady.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.750
Stay here.

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.870
Marcello, get down!

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:17.110
I just came up!

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.230
I'm coming up too.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:45.140
Marcello,
why did you change so much?

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.470
Why don't you love me anymore?

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:55.950
Holy Madonna, if only he married me,

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:59.820
I'd come here on foot
every day to thank you.

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:02.380
I'm not asking you that.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.550
I'd like him to be mine
as he was once.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.590
Here they are!

01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:14.180
Here they are!
As soon as they arrive, take shots.

01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:50.640
Wait for my sign!

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:57.270
Hi, darling, how are you?
Focus on them and then on the crowd.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.710
My wife is there too.

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:13.590
Sometimes she makes me so upset,
and sometimes...

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.950
Calm down... keep calm.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.270
One at a time.

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:42.670
- It's raining.
- It's dangerous.

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:56.630
Water makes lights have short
circuits. Shut everything off!

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:17.870
We took shelter in the bus
because it started to rain again.

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:35.630
The Madonna is over there!

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:54.190
The children are getting up.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.550
They're running
in the opposite direction.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.830
They cry out
that they see the Madonna.

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.150
The wild crowd is following them.

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:19.189
They're headed to another area!

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.590
There she is!

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:55.590
They'll catch pneumonia!

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:03.109
She said if you don't build a church
here she won't come anymore.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:08.319
She said if you don't build a church
here she won't come anymore.

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:11.430
Good night. Go home!

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.990
Leave me!

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:26.390
- Paparazzo, stop it!
- That's a nice shot!

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:31.070
Leave me!
It's impossible to be like you!

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:37.500
You're worse than hyenas!
You don't respect anyone! Slimes!

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:04.190
Alfonso!

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:12.310
Alfonso!

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:55.510
Good evening, I'm Steiner's wife.
We were waiting for you.

01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:12.630
Good evening, Marcello.
How are you?

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:15.310
Good. What a lovely home!

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:19.870
This is Emma.
I've been wanting to meet you.

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:24.510
- Thanks for coming.
- I'll be right back. - Come here!

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.470
- Hi, Anna, how are you?
- Did you finish your book?

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.270
- This is Margherita. You know
her paintings? - Of course.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.830
You didn't even come
to my exhibition!

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:38.860
She's an admirer of your writings
but she doesn't speak Italian.

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:42.310
- She said you're very decorative.
- She's right.

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:47.190
I think I know you well.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:53.670
When you understand that you love
Marcello more than he does...

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.710
you'll be happy.

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:04.510
The only real woman
is the oriental one.

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:08.430
Where was Eve?
In the Garden of Eden!

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.270
Where was the Garden of Eden?
In the orient!

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:15.230
- There is love there!
- Why did you marry me?

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:17.390
I made a big mistake!

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:21.510
Mysterious, motherly,
both lover and daughter.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:27.150
She huddles at your feet
like a tiger in love.

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:30.940
Why doesn't he stay in the Orient?

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:33.910
- Will you introduce Emma to me?
- Of course.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.470
What a lovely face!
Don't lose hold of that guy!

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:42.230
I'm saying it in his interests,
naturally...

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:47.340
The Oriental submits
both her spirit and her flesh.

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:51.950
May I introduce Marcello
and his fiancée?

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:55.510
I'm pleased to meet you.
I agree with your concept on women.

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:59.350
The Oriental woman
can teach us much!

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.430
She's remained close to nature,

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:04.550
the nature she conquered after
centuries of civilization.

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.910
What use is civilization to you?

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.470
You can't make love anymore!

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:13.910
Speak for yourself!

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.150
- Would you like something
to drink? - Yes, please.

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:20.830
I envy you:
I've read all your stories.

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:26.550
I'd like to travel too,
meet women of all races.

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:30.790
I'd like to have children
of all colours: red, yellow...

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:34.390
- Like a bouquet of country flowers.
- You can't say anything else!

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.750
You must have incredible memories.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:42.150
Memories?
Above all, I have projects!

01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:46.020
- What a magnificent creature!
Are you his fiancée? - Yes.

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.110
Are you from the South?

01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:50.150
What an extraordinary person!

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.800
He's written many important books

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:55.510
and has maintained
a childish candour.

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:59.510
I wonder
where he finds so much optimism.

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:02.630
I always watch him with stupor.

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:05.590
At times maybe I envy him.

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:09.950
I see that you have
a beautiful Morandi.

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:12.270
Yes, he's my favourite painter.

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:15.230
The objects are flooded with light

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:19.990
and yet painted with detachment,
precision, rigour...

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:24.910
It's an art
where nothing is coincidental.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.350
Steiner said
that you have two loves,

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.820
and you don't know
which one to choose.

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:35.270
Journalism or literature.
Look out for prisons!

01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:38.190
Stay free, available, like me.

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:43.110
Never get married. Never choose.

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:46.150
Even in love,
It's better to be chosen.

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:54.840
I read your poetry. I like it.
It's strong, precise.

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:56.910
It doesn't look like
a woman's writing.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.350
What do you know about women?

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:03.780
It's the art I prefer.

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:10.110
A clear, crystal art
that doesn't lie and tempt.

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:15.030
I work at a job I don't like now,
but I'm thinking about tomorrow.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:18.790
Let's not forget to live today!

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:25.030
I think if a person lives
intensively in fullness of spirit

01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:29.670
he gets younger every year!

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:40.260
- You're a prophet tonight!
- An alcoholic prophet!

01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:44.670
Friends, you think too much
about the future.

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:48.750
But you seem so different.
What do you do?

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:52.190
What do you like to do most?

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:56.080
I don't know. And you?

01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:02.670
I like the three big evasions:
drinking, smoking, and going to bed.

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:07.700
- Such wisdom!
- You never understood me.

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:12.710
You are a true primitive,
as primitive as a gothic spire.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.510
You're so tall you can't hear
any voices up there!

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:22.070
If you could see my real height...
I'm not taller than this.

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:34.230
<i>As primitive as a gothic spire. </i>

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:39.070
<i>You're so tall you can't hear</i>
<i>any voices up there! </i>

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:43.710
<i>If you could see my real height... </i>
<i>I'm not taller than this. </i>

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:52.710
It's an old recording.
I'll shut it off.

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:56.030
Why, can't we hear it?

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:58.990
I don't want to bore you.

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:01.640
They're nature sounds he's recorded.

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:05.340
- Play them again, please.
- No. - Please.

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:08.000
If they don't interest you,
why did you record them?

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:11.910
I thought they were beautiful.
Do you really want to hear them?

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.950
- I already know how interesting
they are. - As you wish.

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.310
Birds!

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.630
That's exactly the way they sound.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.510
This is a forest.

01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:09.350
What are you doing here?

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:16.150
- Why did you get out of bed?
- You'll get a cold!

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:18.590
Your storm woke him up.

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:25.710
- Did you want one more kiss?
- Dad, you've got a huge head!

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:31.710
A huge head?!
Everyone knows now!

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.750
Such lovely children!

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:38.420
- Such intelligent eyes!
- Yes, It's true.

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:40.820
When one says something
that catches his interest

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:45.470
first he thinks about it, seriously,
then he laughs cheerfully.

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:50.780
If you give him a flower,
first he looks at it,

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:54.030
then laughs because he understands
that It's beautiful.

01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:57.900
The way you smile
when you listen to music.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:03.190
Now back to sleep!
Then I'll come say goodnight.

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:06.820
- Say goodnight to everyone.
- Goodnight.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:12.630
The girl is different.
She likes combinations of words.

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.910
A new phrase enchants her.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.910
At times she invents them.
I noted some of them.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.190
For example:
"Who is the sun's mother?".

01:20:23.230 --> 01:20:26.820
Beautiful,
It's like a poet's phrase.

01:20:28.630 --> 01:20:33.300
- Do they sleep with you?
- They'd like to.

01:20:33.390 --> 01:20:40.420
At times
the little one slips into our bed.

01:20:40.510 --> 01:20:43.860
He takes her mother's finger
and squeezes it.

01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:46.300
You can't imagine how sweet it is

01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:50.340
to fall asleep
with a child next to you.

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:04.140
Have you known Steiner
for a long time?

01:21:04.230 --> 01:21:08.380
Yes, but we've not seen
each other often.

01:21:29.190 --> 01:21:33.740
One day you'll have
a house like this.

01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:45.820
We get on well together, don't we?

01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:16.710
- Let me come here more often.
- Anytime.

01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:18.940
What is it, Marcello?

01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:23.060
I should change environment,
many things.

01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:27.540
Your house is a refuge.

01:22:27.630 --> 01:22:31.820
Your wife, the children, your books,
your extraordinary friends...

01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:34.980
I'm wasting time.
I won't manage anything anymore.

01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:40.660
Once I had ambitions...
but maybe I'm losing everything.

01:22:41.630 --> 01:22:45.580
Safety is not being locked up
in one's home.

01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:52.780
I'm too serious to be a dabbler
but not enough to be a professional.

01:22:53.670 --> 01:22:57.060
A more miserable life
is better, believe me,

01:22:57.150 --> 01:23:04.860
than an existence protected
by a perfectly organized society.

01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:11.260
I'm your friend
but I can't give you any advice.

01:23:12.230 --> 01:23:20.580
I can have you meet an editor
who can give you a decent job.

01:23:21.710 --> 01:23:24.660
It's better
than writing for those papers...

01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:30.490
- Do you want to think about it?
We'll discuss it later. - Yes.

01:23:36.430 --> 01:23:38.380
Come...
