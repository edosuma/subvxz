WEBVTT

02:32.361 --> 02:33.362
Oh, G--

03:32.212 --> 03:33.755
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Eric,

03:33.755 --> 03:37.217
I need you to confirm a girl's last name.
Did you get the clip?

03:37.801 --> 03:39.761
<i>I got it. Tell me what I'm looking for.</i>

03:40.345 --> 03:44.766
Okay, so there's a little girl
who shows up at about 30 seconds,

03:44.766 --> 03:46.226
and we interviewed her.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.353
She'd had to have signed a release form, right?

03:50.314 --> 03:51.481
<i>Got a name?</i>

03:51.481 --> 03:54.276
Yeah. Leanne Grayson.

03:55.152 --> 03:57.196
She'd have been about eight or nine
at the time.

03:57.196 --> 03:58.363
<i>Gotcha. Stand by.</i>

03:58.864 --> 03:59.907
Okay.

04:01.283 --> 04:03.660
<i>The talent portion of the competition.</i>

04:03.660 --> 04:07.247
- <i>I'm Dorothy Turner, 8 News.</i>
- <i>You're ruining this for me. Get up.</i>

04:08.790 --> 04:10.792
- <i>Dorothy?</i>
- Yeah. Yes, I'm here.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.753
<i>Sorry, Dorothy.</i>

04:13.253 --> 04:16.089
<i>She must not have signed a form,
or maybe she used a different name.</i>

04:19.301 --> 04:20.677
Are you sure?

04:20.677 --> 04:21.845
<i>Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

04:37.736 --> 04:38.904
How'd you sleep?

04:40.572 --> 04:41.907
Like a baby.

04:44.868 --> 04:46.578
Don't you ever listen to anything else?

04:48.622 --> 04:49.790
Dance with me.

04:50.457 --> 04:53.126
No. I'm no good sober.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.211
Come on.

04:55.254 --> 04:56.380
I'll lead.

04:58.507 --> 05:01.093
We need to talk about
what happened at the party.

05:01.093 --> 05:02.177
No, we don't.

05:02.928 --> 05:05.180
People keep getting hurt in this house.

05:05.180 --> 05:06.265
Relax.

05:07.558 --> 05:09.059
You're safe when you're with me.

05:10.185 --> 05:11.478
What does that even mean?

05:12.145 --> 05:14.773
I need you to tell me
that I'm not alone in this.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.068
Tell me you see
how fucked-up things have gotten.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.946
Julian, shut up.

05:23.198 --> 05:24.199
Fuck.

05:25.742 --> 05:26.910
You bit me.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.371
You talk too much.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.627
<i>The emulsion will break.
I think it might be--</i>

05:35.627 --> 05:37.671
- <i>Do you hear me talking to you?</i>
- <i>Yes, Chef.</i>

05:37.671 --> 05:39.339
<i>Okay. Well, here's your fucking emulsion.</i>

05:41.216 --> 05:42.509
<i>Five minutes!</i>

05:43.844 --> 05:45.846
<i>So, your excuse is
that this is incomplete?</i>

05:46.430 --> 05:50.350
- <i>Are you crying in my kitchen?</i>
- <i>No, Chef.</i>

05:50.350 --> 05:52.769
<i>There's more salt in your tears
than there is in this XO sauce.</i>

05:52.769 --> 05:54.021
<i>Chef, I think I forgot to--</i>

05:54.021 --> 05:56.940
<i>Enough excuses, Dominic.
Get the fuck outta my kitchen.</i>

05:56.940 --> 05:59.318
<i>Get outta here! Sean! Sean! Sean!</i>

05:59.318 --> 06:00.777
Look at that.

06:03.447 --> 06:05.240
Yeah. That's right.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.911
- Dada's gone viral.
- <i>Get the fuck out.</i>

06:12.164 --> 06:13.832
- What's this?
- You know what it is.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.460
Your bedside reading.
Been doing some research?

06:18.337 --> 06:22.090
We need to talk about this. But not here.

06:25.969 --> 06:28.597
Leanne. She's the common factor.

06:29.932 --> 06:31.183
When she's angry, things go bad.

06:31.183 --> 06:33.852
When she's happy, things go well,
inexplicably well.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.897
And it all remains intact
as long as we stay loyal to her.

06:38.106 --> 06:42.653
The infestation, the house falling apart,
Dorothy's accident, Jericho.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.657
I've been searching, and there's a term
for something like that.

06:48.784 --> 06:49.910
The Faustian bargain.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.247
This is crazy. We sound insane.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.874
You thought
you found Leanne's headstone, right?

06:57.125 --> 07:00.045
We thought that was Leanne playing a trick
on us, but what if it wasn't?

07:01.755 --> 07:02.756
What if she died?

07:04.424 --> 07:06.093
What if she came back as something?

07:08.929 --> 07:10.639
The cult believes they're servants of God.

07:12.766 --> 07:13.934
Exactly.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.727
Leanne abandoned their ways when she left.

07:18.981 --> 07:21.024
Fallen angel.

07:27.489 --> 07:28.532
What's happening?

07:31.702 --> 07:32.703
Wh--

07:34.246 --> 07:35.497
You can't talk?

07:44.923 --> 07:46.049
What are you doing down here?

07:46.967 --> 07:48.802
I needed a change of scenery.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.220
Well, you should've called for me.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.563
Taking Jericho for his walk?

08:00.272 --> 08:01.273
Yeah.

08:02.191 --> 08:05.194
- Wish I could come.
- Soon.

08:07.863 --> 08:09.156
Are you gonna be okay here?

08:09.156 --> 08:12.451
Yes. I'm working on a story, actually.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.163
Can I help?

08:18.665 --> 08:19.791
No.

08:21.251 --> 08:22.461
I don't have a lead yet.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.881
It's like finding a needle in a haystack.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.051
That's a funny expression.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.136
Doesn't seem like
it'd be a very hard thing to do.

08:35.557 --> 08:36.600
You'll crack it, though.

08:38.477 --> 08:39.727
Dorothy Turner always does.

08:41.897 --> 08:42.898
Okay.

08:43.899 --> 08:47.194
You think silver bullets could stop her?
I mean, worst-case?

08:52.533 --> 08:54.076
"Werewolf." Right.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.120
Garlic?

08:59.456 --> 09:00.457
No.

09:01.583 --> 09:04.086
She loves my spaghetti <i>aglio e olio.</i>

09:05.337 --> 09:06.338
Right.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.094
Maybe water's her weakness.
I've never seen her bathe. Have you?

09:15.681 --> 09:16.682
Right.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.434
Cheers, brother.

09:23.272 --> 09:24.273
Hey.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.068
Hey.

09:28.068 --> 09:31.196
Roscoe, what the hell?
How long have you been standing there?

09:36.869 --> 09:38.537
I'm sorry to show up like this.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.040
There's someone here to see you.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.585
Someone who can answer all your questions.

09:53.802 --> 09:54.928
George.

10:02.603 --> 10:03.645
Hello, Sean.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.273
Hello, Julian.

10:06.857 --> 10:08.442
He's asked me to wait outside.

10:09.568 --> 10:10.569
Good luck.

10:14.823 --> 10:17.618
How did you get in here?
I lock this place.

10:17.618 --> 10:20.329
There are far more pertinent
things to discuss.

10:20.913 --> 10:23.415
You see, today is a very important day.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.460
Today is the day I confess.

10:28.462 --> 10:31.381
It's time I told you the truth
about Leanne Grayson.

10:32.758 --> 10:36.094
<i>"Devastating fire kills
family of three in Oneida, Wisconsin."</i>

10:36.845 --> 10:38.055
<i>"Body of the daughter,</i>

10:38.055 --> 10:41.808
<i>Leanne Grayson, never recovered.
Presumed dead."</i>

10:42.434 --> 10:45.187
<i>Blah, blah, blah.
She was eight at the time.</i>

10:47.314 --> 10:49.650
- Do we know how the fire started?
- <i>Nope.</i>

10:52.611 --> 10:55.072
I owe your family a great apology.

10:55.614 --> 10:57.741
No, it's us who should be apologizing.

10:57.741 --> 11:01.078
You tried to tell us what she was,
and we didn't believe you.

11:02.704 --> 11:07.543
I made the recent decision
to leave the Church of the Lesser Saints.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.129
I aim to right my wrongs.

11:13.549 --> 11:17.469
What we have done to your family
is the most egregious of those wrongs.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.431
You have been lied to.

11:22.933 --> 11:24.017
Fooled.

11:24.810 --> 11:25.936
Like the rest of us.

11:28.772 --> 11:33.610
I tried to hang myself once long ago.

11:35.279 --> 11:36.864
I was a very sad man.

11:39.032 --> 11:43.537
I awoke in the hospital room
with a woman staring at me.

11:45.956 --> 11:47.624
Her name was May Markham.

11:49.293 --> 11:53.714
And she told me that I had died

11:54.548 --> 11:57.759
and been reborn a servant of God.

12:01.430 --> 12:06.185
I had nothing else to live for,
and so I chose to adopt the faith.

12:07.895 --> 12:11.398
From there, we began our journey
as aunt and uncle

12:11.398 --> 12:13.066
bringing others into the gospel.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.359
We were great at it.

12:19.031 --> 12:24.453
Leanne's family died in a fire
when she was a young girl.

12:25.996 --> 12:29.416
Her mother had been very cruel to her.

12:31.793 --> 12:36.590
And so she felt the death had been,
in great part, her fault.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.761
She was the perfect candidate.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.932
And I told her what I had once been told.

12:45.474 --> 12:50.896
That she had died in that fire
and come back a servant of the Lord.

12:53.023 --> 12:56.235
But we miscalculated how broken she was.

12:58.612 --> 13:03.534
She quickly became a most vivid believer
in these extraordinary things.

13:05.202 --> 13:07.579
And when she left us,

13:07.579 --> 13:12.042
Leanne began to believe
she was becoming something else.

13:27.683 --> 13:29.017
But that is not the truth.

13:31.186 --> 13:35.774
You see, the beliefs of the church
have always been an illusion.

13:37.192 --> 13:42.865
Leanne is a confused, deranged
and completely ordinary girl.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.158
- What?
- Nothing more.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.537
That's bullshit. We've seen too much.

13:48.537 --> 13:51.915
Yesterday at Jericho's birthday,
the animals went insane.

13:52.583 --> 13:53.876
A woman nearly died.

13:53.876 --> 13:56.378
The way her face looked,
I've never seen anything like it.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.588
How do you explain that?

13:58.172 --> 14:02.593
I visited Beverly Alcott in the hospital
this morning as part of my amends.

14:03.302 --> 14:06.972
She'd suffered a snakebite
but is well on her way to a full recovery.

14:06.972 --> 14:08.056
What?

14:08.056 --> 14:11.852
The venom of a Peruvian Bothrops
can cause spontaneous swelling,

14:12.519 --> 14:14.479
discoloration of the face and limbs.

14:21.028 --> 14:24.031
The simplest solution
is almost always the right one.

14:24.615 --> 14:26.408
What do we know about the mother?

14:27.784 --> 14:28.785
<i>Laura Grayson.</i>

14:29.286 --> 14:33.540
<i>Looks like she had trouble with liquor.
There's a DUI in 2005.</i>

14:34.166 --> 14:35.167
<i>A pretty bad crash.</i>

14:35.918 --> 14:36.919
Okay.

14:38.170 --> 14:39.254
Maybe there's something there.

14:39.254 --> 14:42.758
What are some dates?
Birthday, date of incarceration,

14:42.758 --> 14:44.092
date of death, anything?

14:45.886 --> 14:47.638
There's gonna be something
with her mother.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.057
When Leanne first arrived,

14:50.057 --> 14:53.977
I lost my ability to feel and taste
when she was angry with me.

14:53.977 --> 14:57.940
Taste and feeling can be lost temporarily
during a common cold

14:58.899 --> 15:01.193
or in the presence of certain drugs.

15:01.693 --> 15:04.571
It is possible
she was putting something in your food

15:05.072 --> 15:07.241
to make you believe
you were being punished.

15:07.241 --> 15:10.327
I kept finding splinters everywhere.
Like the house was attacking me.

15:10.327 --> 15:12.996
It's one of Leanne's favorite tricks.

15:13.705 --> 15:16.625
It was not uncommon,
when I'd discipline her as a child,

15:16.625 --> 15:20.254
to find a shard of wood
or a sliver of glass

15:20.254 --> 15:22.089
in my chair the next day.

15:35.561 --> 15:38.814
Whenever Leanne leaves the house,
Jericho turns back into a doll.

15:38.814 --> 15:40.524
We've searched every inch of this place.

15:40.524 --> 15:43.485
There is nowhere she could be hiding him.
That I'm sure of.

15:44.069 --> 15:47.614
These old houses always have secrets.

15:48.699 --> 15:50.325
Yours has more than most.

15:51.451 --> 15:55.539
Baby!

15:57.916 --> 16:01.587
Baby! Wake up, little baby!

16:25.819 --> 16:28.363
<i>There is a network of tunnels
beneath this neighborhood.</i>

16:28.989 --> 16:32.534
<i>They were built in the 19th century
by opulent families</i>

16:32.534 --> 16:35.370
<i>to transport mentally ill relatives
for treatment.</i>

16:36.246 --> 16:40.792
<i>It was a way of hiding the issues
they'd rather not display to high society.</i>

16:41.919 --> 16:46.965
Leanne has known about these tunnels
since the beginning.

16:48.717 --> 16:53.680
We make it our mission to know about
the secrets of a place before we enter it.

16:55.724 --> 17:00.437
This is how
Leanne brought the child into your life.

17:02.064 --> 17:05.651
How she made him disappear
and reappear at will.

17:07.694 --> 17:08.737
An illusion.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.576
<i>Dorothy, you're a genius.</i>

17:15.117 --> 17:17.871
<i>The mother, Laura,
died two days after that fire.</i>

17:18.372 --> 17:20.958
<i>The date was April 17th, 2011.</i>

17:21.875 --> 17:24.086
<i>Check out April 17th the following year.</i>

17:29.258 --> 17:31.844
<i>Take a good look at the reflection
at the end of your tagline.</i>

17:32.594 --> 17:33.595
<i>What do you see?</i>

17:33.595 --> 17:36.098
<i>Ever hear the expression,
"So cute I could eat you up"?</i>

17:36.098 --> 17:39.810
<i>Philly's Bakeshop on 20th
has introduced a radical new concept.</i>

17:40.310 --> 17:42.271
<i>Cupcakes with faces.</i>

17:42.771 --> 17:45.732
<i>So tell us,
what inspired this delicious idea?</i>

17:46.567 --> 17:49.444
<i>Well, it was supposed to be
a Valentine's Day special,</i>

17:49.444 --> 17:53.782
<i>but it really took off.
I guess people like to eat people.</i>

17:54.658 --> 17:56.243
<i>Especially ones they don't like.</i>

17:57.244 --> 17:59.371
<i>This is my third-grade teacher.</i>

18:01.874 --> 18:02.875
<i>She's gone.</i>

18:03.959 --> 18:06.712
<i>Well,
this has certainly been a sweet addition</i>

18:06.712 --> 18:10.215
<i>to Bakeshop on 20th's popular lineup
of cookies, cakes and pies.</i>

18:10.799 --> 18:14.386
<i>And the crowds are eating it up.
I'm Dorothy Turner, 8 News.</i>

18:16.763 --> 18:17.890
<i>Do you see them?</i>

18:17.890 --> 18:18.974
Oh, my God.

18:18.974 --> 18:21.727
<i>Now take a look
at the next year's tape, same day.</i>

18:22.853 --> 18:26.440
No.
I've seen her manipulate life and death.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.108
There was the dog and--

18:28.108 --> 18:30.944
and Dorothy's colleague
on live television.

18:32.321 --> 18:35.991
We all search for meaning in dark things.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.245
What about my boy?

18:42.122 --> 18:46.168
I know he died. But that child up there,
he feels like my son.

18:47.294 --> 18:53.175
We searched for missing persons cases.
There was nothing. I know that's my son.

18:56.428 --> 19:03.060
<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i> published
an obituary in September of 2019.

19:05.521 --> 19:08.482
A woman overdosed near Fitler Square Park.

19:09.608 --> 19:10.609
An addict.

19:11.777 --> 19:14.279
Some say she was traveling with an infant.

19:15.739 --> 19:18.867
A little boy with blue eyes.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.830
But if he was never reported missing,
how could you know?

19:24.456 --> 19:27.376
We have people on the streets
who hear these things.

19:36.635 --> 19:39.137
<i>...neighborhood is out of this world.</i>

19:39.137 --> 19:40.556
<i>Just this morning,</i>

19:40.556 --> 19:45.727
<i>three residents claimed to have spotted
a large floating disk hovering in the sky.</i>

19:45.727 --> 19:48.313
<i>Skeptics argue aliens aren't real</i>

19:48.313 --> 19:51.942
<i>and that this morning's excitement is just
a product of delusion or even a hoax.</i>

19:51.942 --> 19:53.318
<i>All I can say is,</i>

19:53.318 --> 19:57.197
<i>if our extraterrestrial friends
really are out there, beam me up.</i>

20:02.703 --> 20:04.413
<i>...can say is, if our e</i>-

20:05.414 --> 20:08.792
<i>This girl's visited you
on the anniversary of her mother's death.</i>

20:09.751 --> 20:11.044
<i>That's some freaky shit.</i>

20:12.963 --> 20:14.590
<i>Why would she do this to us?</i>

20:15.591 --> 20:17.384
Why would she do this to Dorothy?

20:17.384 --> 20:21.471
Leanne saw Dorothy once
when she was very young.

20:23.599 --> 20:26.393
Soon after she lost her mother,
it became an obsession.

20:29.521 --> 20:32.941
<i>I allowed her one day each year
to visit Dorothy's work</i>

20:34.443 --> 20:36.403
<i>in hopes that it would help her grieve.</i>

20:38.530 --> 20:41.408
<i>She'd plan her outfits weeks in advance.</i>

20:43.785 --> 20:47.331
But it wasn't enough to observe.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.876
She needed to be a part of Dorothy's life.

21:03.805 --> 21:07.142
<i>She watched Dorothy for weeks.</i>

21:24.493 --> 21:27.579
<i>Your son's death was the turning point.</i>

21:40.968 --> 21:42.094
<i>It was her way in.</i>

21:49.977 --> 21:53.146
<i>I believe she saw the abandoned infant</i>

21:53.146 --> 21:58.151
<i>as an act of God. An opportunity
to get the mother she wanted.</i>

22:01.113 --> 22:02.739
<i>So she took it.</i>

22:07.035 --> 22:08.078
Hello, Jericho.

22:11.748 --> 22:15.127
I hope you know I take
no pleasure in telling you all this.

22:16.670 --> 22:17.963
My apologies.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.216
And my condolences.

22:24.094 --> 22:26.555
Healing is born from truth.

22:28.432 --> 22:30.267
I hope now you can begin.

22:31.435 --> 22:35.898
What I have to ask of you now
won't be easy...

22:38.233 --> 22:41.320
but it is the most important part
of my reform.

22:43.363 --> 22:46.825
I need your help getting Leanne back.

22:52.831 --> 22:56.084
That's all we want, George.
That and the baby.

23:04.426 --> 23:06.345
Everything you told me was a lie?

23:11.725 --> 23:14.311
I left my family for your faith.

23:15.604 --> 23:17.397
You've played your role.

23:18.857 --> 23:20.859
I believe it's time
to return to your family.

23:22.611 --> 23:24.363
The story here is nearly over.

23:57.187 --> 23:58.605
Did you cook all this by yourself?

24:02.484 --> 24:05.320
Do you mind setting the table?
Dinner's almost ready.

24:08.323 --> 24:09.741
Where have you two been?

24:09.741 --> 24:10.951
Brother bonding.

24:11.910 --> 24:12.911
Your voice.

24:13.996 --> 24:15.247
I feel much better now.

24:16.248 --> 24:17.499
Could you take this out for me?

24:33.182 --> 24:34.391
What did you do today, Leanne?

24:35.267 --> 24:37.311
I went to the market with Jericho.

24:38.478 --> 24:40.439
Julian, what happened to your voice?

24:41.023 --> 24:42.316
Allergies.

24:44.401 --> 24:46.403
- You sure about that?
- Dottie, please pass the salt?

24:46.403 --> 24:47.654
This doesn't need salt.

24:47.654 --> 24:49.823
This is exactly the way
Mom used to make it.

24:50.324 --> 24:53.118
Do you remember all those amazing dinners
she would make us?

24:53.827 --> 24:55.829
My God, she loved us so much.

24:55.829 --> 24:57.164
Sean, how was your day?

24:58.498 --> 24:59.499
I went viral today.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.210
Really? That's amazing.

25:02.252 --> 25:03.420
You must be so grateful.

25:04.004 --> 25:06.465
Happens to a lot of people.
It's not that special.

25:08.133 --> 25:09.301
That's not true.

25:09.927 --> 25:12.137
Actually, I'm thinking of
canceling my contract.

25:12.137 --> 25:14.306
- You can't do that.
- He can do whatever he wants.

25:15.516 --> 25:16.517
What?

25:22.773 --> 25:24.024
You should all be very careful.

25:36.912 --> 25:37.955
Isn't this nice?

25:39.748 --> 25:41.792
All of us dining together again?

25:50.884 --> 25:54.721
Forgive your humble servant
for his blasphemy.

25:57.182 --> 25:59.476
I have sinned with my lies.

26:06.942 --> 26:08.110
Through my deceit,

26:09.653 --> 26:12.698
I have put this family in grave danger.

26:19.705 --> 26:24.585
But we are all in danger.
It was our last hope.

26:25.711 --> 26:29.006
Please,

26:29.798 --> 26:35.262
give them the strength
to bring the Fallen one back to us.

26:41.226 --> 26:42.603
Forgive me.

26:44.605 --> 26:48.901
Forgive me.
