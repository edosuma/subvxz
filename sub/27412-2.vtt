-You're Quigley Quagmire.
-We heard you perished in a fire.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.375
I survived.

01:20.916 --> 01:22.416
My name is Lemony Snicket,

01:22.791 --> 01:24.750
and I have spent years, months,

01:24.833 --> 01:28.000
and countless consecutive
and nonconsecutive days

01:28.083 --> 01:31.000
investigating how a person
might survive a fire.

01:31.916 --> 01:34.541
A person might survive
if he was unable to sleep,

01:34.625 --> 01:36.708
so instead of being in bed
with his siblings,

01:36.791 --> 01:39.666
he was in the kitchen
drinking hot cider with his mother,

01:39.916 --> 01:41.125
who smelled the smoke...

01:41.791 --> 01:44.250
and helped him into a secret tunnel
under the house

01:44.333 --> 01:46.541
while she went to get
the rest of the family.

01:48.291 --> 01:50.208
-[gasps]
-[Quigley] She never came back.

01:51.250 --> 01:52.166
I was an orphan.

01:52.583 --> 01:53.916
We know exactly how that feels.

01:54.000 --> 01:54.958
I know you do.

01:55.375 --> 01:59.083
The survivor might follow the tunnel
until it led to a house...

02:02.791 --> 02:05.250
An empty house filled with empty cages

02:05.333 --> 02:08.500
that once held the finest
reptile collection in the world.

02:08.583 --> 02:11.333
-[Klaus]  Our Uncle Monty lived there.
- [Quigley]  No one lives there now.

02:11.625 --> 02:13.708
[Lemony]  You might find
canned peaches to eat...

02:13.791 --> 02:14.750
[screeching]

02:15.875 --> 02:17.875
[panting]

02:22.916 --> 02:24.583
And books to read.

02:29.541 --> 02:32.750
With a little research, you might learn
of a secret organization

02:32.833 --> 02:34.541
and the schism that tore it apart.

02:35.666 --> 02:36.666
[bell dings]

02:39.125 --> 02:41.000
You might learn
other startling information.

02:44.375 --> 02:45.375
[bell dings]

02:45.458 --> 02:48.250
[brakes screech]

03:00.083 --> 03:01.083

03:02.208 --> 03:04.416
Next stop, the Hinterlands,
the Mortmain Mountains,

03:04.500 --> 03:06.750
and a bunch of even more
dangerous destinations!

03:07.166 --> 03:08.250
[bell dings]

03:09.833 --> 03:12.875
He might even read
about a secret mountain headquarters

03:12.958 --> 03:15.250
and join a group of Snow Scouts as a cover

03:15.333 --> 03:18.500
in case the people who burned down
his home are still out there.

03:19.125 --> 03:22.791
This place was my last hope
to finding my brother and sister.

03:22.875 --> 03:24.166
Duncan and Isadora are safe.

03:24.250 --> 03:26.750
They escaped Count Olaf
in a self-sustaining hot air mobile home.

03:26.833 --> 03:28.250
-How do you know?
-We helped them.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.875
-They're our friends.
-Where are they?

03:29.958 --> 03:31.625
We're not sure, but they are safe.

03:32.666 --> 03:34.583
We were hoping to find
one of our parents up here.

03:35.875 --> 03:37.416
But we're glad we found you.

03:37.500 --> 03:38.583
And we'll find Sunny.

03:39.333 --> 03:41.083
You saved my siblings, Baudelaires.

03:42.125 --> 03:43.625
Let me help you save yours.

03:44.083 --> 03:45.916
[bearded man] So this is Sunny Baudelaire.

03:46.375 --> 03:49.333
[Olaf] I threw her siblings off a mountain
and I'm keeping her as my servant.

03:49.416 --> 03:51.500
Look who's not a total disappointment
after all.

03:52.791 --> 03:56.125
An infant servant. I had one of those
myself before the schism.

03:56.208 --> 03:58.625
The schism was a long time ago.
That baby must be all grown up.

03:58.708 --> 03:59.750
Not necessarily.

04:03.250 --> 04:06.250
You've caused almost as many problems
as your parents did.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.000
But we know how to solve problems,
don't we?

04:08.666 --> 04:11.125
[bearded man] Fire can solve
any problem in the world.

04:11.208 --> 04:14.541
For example, we heard a nasty rumor
that the survivor of a recent fire

04:14.625 --> 04:17.833
was hiding at V.F.D. headquarters,
so we paid it a visit.

04:18.208 --> 04:20.000
There aren't any survivors now.

04:20.916 --> 04:23.291
Sorry, just to be clear,
when you say there aren't survivors,

04:23.375 --> 04:26.125
do you mean you killed them
or didn't find them? I'm a bit confused.

04:26.208 --> 04:28.875
The place was deserted.
The rumors were obviously false.

04:28.958 --> 04:32.750
We did run into one of your
old associates, the Snicket girl.

04:34.833 --> 04:36.500
-What did you do with her?
-She got away.

04:36.583 --> 04:37.708
[woman] She won't get far.

04:37.791 --> 04:39.458
She's in the middle of the mountains.

04:39.541 --> 04:41.625
[bearded man]  And she's all alone.

04:41.708 --> 04:43.791
[coughing]

04:44.125 --> 04:45.000
You're awake!

04:45.083 --> 04:48.333
You were out cold, and I don't mean
just because of the temperature.

04:48.416 --> 04:50.708
I went to get us some breakfast.
I found these berries.

04:51.125 --> 04:51.958
Those are poisonous.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.208
-Argh!
-Mr. Poe,

04:53.291 --> 04:55.375
I'm grateful for the help,
the granola bar,

04:55.458 --> 04:57.666
and the horse blanket
that smelled like nail polish,

04:57.750 --> 05:01.250
but I need to get back to the city.
Where there's smoke, there's fire, and...

05:01.333 --> 05:02.458
[knife slashes]

05:03.041 --> 05:05.916
-[sighs] I've seen a lot of smoke.
-I was a Snow Scout in my youth,

05:06.000 --> 05:08.541
and even a peewee-level dropout can see
that you're in no condition

05:08.625 --> 05:09.958
to walk down a mountain.

05:10.041 --> 05:11.250
I'm planning to ski.

05:12.583 --> 05:15.041
Perhaps I could be accommodating
and give you a ride.

05:15.125 --> 05:17.458
-You have a car?
-I was thinking of going to the city.

05:17.541 --> 05:19.541
They say absence
makes the heart grow fonder,

05:19.625 --> 05:21.291
and I hope that's true of Mr. Tamerlane.

05:21.375 --> 05:23.083
He was very mad at me when I left.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.125
How would you like more than just a ride?

05:26.208 --> 05:30.250
How would you like a desk job
in the financial sector?

05:30.333 --> 05:32.500
-I prefer to work on my feet.
-We have an opening.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.666
My longtime secretary
recently returned to Winnipeg.

05:34.750 --> 05:37.708
It seems that her mother passed away,
and now she's the duchess of something.

05:37.791 --> 05:39.458
-It'll be plenty of excitement.
-[buzzing]

05:39.541 --> 05:42.333
[Lemony]  "Where there's smoke,
there's fire" is an expression

05:42.416 --> 05:45.666
that means if something seems wrong,
it usually is.

05:45.750 --> 05:48.250
I can promise you the office
will be buzzing with activity.

05:48.333 --> 05:49.500
I can hear it now.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.750
I need you to move toward me
very quickly and very quietly.

05:52.833 --> 05:53.791
[buzzing]

05:56.791 --> 05:59.458
[screams] Ice bees!

06:00.458 --> 06:01.625
I may need that ride.

06:01.708 --> 06:04.666
[Lemony]  I'm sorry to say
that there is a great deal of wrong

06:04.750 --> 06:06.041
at the top of Mount Fraught...

06:06.791 --> 06:08.458
mostly for Sunny Baudelaire.

06:08.541 --> 06:10.791
This is a great deal of wrong, for me!

06:11.083 --> 06:13.208
I am supposed to be
at the top of the world,

06:13.291 --> 06:16.625
but instead, those two show up,
try and berate and belittle me.

06:16.916 --> 06:18.458
Do you know how it feels

06:18.541 --> 06:22.083
to try so hard to please people
who fail to recognize your talent?

06:22.166 --> 06:23.833
-Not at all.
-I need a cigarette,

06:23.916 --> 06:25.875
or whatever these green sticks are.

06:26.875 --> 06:27.708
I got it.

06:28.250 --> 06:29.083
[Olaf] Hm.

06:31.416 --> 06:32.375
[splutters]

06:37.458 --> 06:39.416
[coughing]

06:42.000 --> 06:43.166
You seem stressed, boss.

06:43.750 --> 06:46.541
You should take some deep breaths.
Maybe a short constitutional.

06:46.625 --> 06:48.541
I don't have time
to read a bunch of amendments!

06:48.625 --> 06:52.458
I need to find a way to have my mentors
think I'm a raging success.

06:52.541 --> 06:55.208
-What if I put on a show?
-Is that a good idea?

06:55.291 --> 06:57.083
They don't seem
like they appreciate the arts.

06:57.166 --> 06:59.500
It's not a good idea.
It's a stupendous idea!

06:59.583 --> 07:01.583
A little song, a little dance,

07:01.666 --> 07:03.666
a monologue from  The Taming of Macbeth.

07:03.750 --> 07:05.625
What's more beloved than dinner theater?

07:06.125 --> 07:06.958
It's breakfast.

07:07.041 --> 07:09.041
It will be, once the baby cooks it.

07:09.625 --> 07:12.250
And it better be hot this time, baby!

07:13.416 --> 07:16.583
Sunny Baudelaire had several problems
she needed to solve.

07:16.666 --> 07:20.041
She was being held captive by villains
on top of a mountain

07:20.125 --> 07:21.416
and needed an escape.

07:21.500 --> 07:24.250
She needed to cook a hot breakfast
for those same villains

07:24.333 --> 07:27.250
with only a few cold salmon,
and she needed a way to signal

07:27.333 --> 07:30.500
to the V.F.D. agent
she'd recently heard was on the mountain,

07:31.041 --> 07:33.250
who she hoped might be able to rescue her.

07:33.333 --> 07:35.541
What kind of baby doesn't know
how to start a fire?

07:37.666 --> 07:40.375
Smoking is very, very bad for you.

07:40.958 --> 07:42.833
So only use this to cook with.

07:43.708 --> 07:44.541
Got it?

07:44.625 --> 07:45.958
Hurry, I'm famished!

07:46.041 --> 07:47.833
[Lemony]  It was a terrible situation,

07:47.916 --> 07:51.583
but Sunny had watched her siblings
escape many terrible situations

07:51.666 --> 07:53.000
with clever ideas.

07:53.291 --> 07:56.291
So when Count Olaf gave her
that odd, green cigarette,

07:56.375 --> 08:00.041
it gave her an idea
that could solve all of her problems.

08:01.541 --> 08:04.041
You're gonna use that odd, green
cigarette to smoke that salmon?

08:05.083 --> 08:06.416
Hey, that's a clever idea.

08:11.958 --> 08:13.541
[Violet] Look, green smoke.

08:14.166 --> 08:15.000
That's odd.

08:15.583 --> 08:16.791
It's coming from Mount Fraught.

08:16.875 --> 08:18.125
It's a Verdant Flammable Device.

08:18.208 --> 08:20.458
I read that V.F.D. use them
for sending signals.

08:20.541 --> 08:23.291
-So it could be someone from V.F.D.
-Or it could be Sunny.

08:24.958 --> 08:27.000
-We have to get up there.
-It's a long way to the top.

08:27.083 --> 08:29.291
We have to go back through
the Vernacularly Fastened Door,

08:29.375 --> 08:32.041
down the Vertical Flame Diversion,
and hike the same road the Scouts--

08:32.125 --> 08:35.416
-There's a more direct way to the top.
-No, there's not. Look at the map.

08:35.500 --> 08:36.833
Look at the waterfall.

08:50.666 --> 08:53.583
[Esmé] So I said, "Oh, I know!
We'll take the elevator,"

08:53.666 --> 08:54.958
and I pushed them!

08:55.041 --> 08:55.958
How elegant.

08:56.041 --> 08:57.750
-If ineffective.
-They were certainly scared.

08:57.833 --> 09:00.041
I thought their eyes were going
to pop out of their heads!

09:00.125 --> 09:04.125
Olaf could learn from you, my dear.
He's so flashy, so theatrical.

09:04.208 --> 09:06.375
He has to make everything
a big production.

09:06.458 --> 09:09.041
[Olaf] Drumroll! Curtain! Toss it up.

09:09.125 --> 09:10.458
I mean, down curtain.

09:10.541 --> 09:12.708
[drum roll continues]

09:12.791 --> 09:13.625
La...

09:15.250 --> 09:17.458
Lady and gentleman,

09:17.541 --> 09:20.791
prepare for a tale so horrifying

09:20.875 --> 09:23.333
it will make the hair on your head
stand straight up.

09:23.958 --> 09:25.125
Ooh, no.

09:25.208 --> 09:27.041
Uh, fall right out.

09:27.125 --> 09:29.041
Ooh, that's also not...

09:30.291 --> 09:32.458
It is a tale of arson...

09:33.541 --> 09:34.791
and murder.

09:35.625 --> 09:38.583
The herpetologist,
poisoned by his own venom.

09:39.166 --> 09:42.791
The fullygrown woman
fed to fullygrown leeches.

09:43.416 --> 09:46.541
The volunteers murdered to death

09:46.625 --> 09:49.208
in various scenic locales.

09:49.541 --> 09:50.666
But most of all,

09:51.166 --> 09:52.250
it is the tale...

09:53.791 --> 09:54.625
of me.

09:55.791 --> 10:00.375
For I am the one who committed
all of those terrible deeds.

10:00.666 --> 10:03.166
Me, Count Olaf,

10:03.250 --> 10:06.125
the handsomest, most successful,

10:06.208 --> 10:10.375
most deserving-of-approval person alive!

10:15.375 --> 10:16.500
[howling]

10:16.583 --> 10:18.750
Maybe we should just move along
to the production number.

10:18.833 --> 10:19.875
And a one, and a two,

10:19.958 --> 10:21.750
-and a three, four, five!
-[all singing]

10:21.833 --> 10:22.708
Enough!

10:22.791 --> 10:24.666
[music stops]

10:24.750 --> 10:28.666
When we recruited you, it was to spread
fire and destruction across the land.

10:28.750 --> 10:31.291
Not to prance around
with a bunch of talentless fools.

10:31.375 --> 10:33.166
[bearded man] Who call themselves actors.

10:33.250 --> 10:36.041
Personally, I would never want to act.
I'm in the financial sector.

10:36.541 --> 10:38.958
It was all going swimmingly
until you botched the cue!

10:39.041 --> 10:41.166
Speaking of swimming,
the smoked salmon smells great.

10:44.916 --> 10:45.750
Fools!

10:55.250 --> 10:56.125
The smoke went out.

10:56.208 --> 10:58.041
Maybe the Verdant Flammable Device
burnt out.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.791
Or maybe the person signaling got caught.

10:59.875 --> 11:03.375
What were you thinking, giving a Verdant
Flammable Device to Sunny Baudelaire?

11:03.458 --> 11:05.750
-Ow!
-How dare you give a cigarette to a baby?

11:05.833 --> 11:07.458
But I didn't. Ow!

11:07.541 --> 11:10.083
It isn't a cigarette.
It's a signaling device.

11:10.166 --> 11:14.666
That baby just broadcast our location
to every V.F.D. agent for a hundred miles!

11:14.750 --> 11:17.458
I thought you were a prisoner,
but I'm beginning to think you're a spy.

11:20.291 --> 11:23.083
-She doesn't sound like a spy.
-She sounds like a helpless baby.

11:23.166 --> 11:24.541
Yeah, listen to her baby talk.

11:24.625 --> 11:28.875
Oh, please. I've seen better performances
from a chimp with a cymbal.

11:29.166 --> 11:31.625
She's just acting like a helpless baby.

11:32.041 --> 11:34.166
I know. I'm an actor.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
[Olaf] Babies are always plotting
against people,

11:38.083 --> 11:40.083
and this one is the worst.

11:40.166 --> 11:42.791
I would throw the little traitor
off this mountain right now

11:42.875 --> 11:45.083
if I didn't need her alive
to get the Baudelaire fortune.

11:45.166 --> 11:46.625
The Baudelaire fortune?

11:46.708 --> 11:50.041
I've been after it for a long time,
and it's finally in my grasp.

11:50.125 --> 11:52.083
The Baudelaire fortune is small potatoes.

11:52.166 --> 11:53.750
No, I'm pretty sure it's money.

11:53.833 --> 11:54.916
We taught you to think big.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.833
Yeah, a big pile of money.

11:57.125 --> 11:58.875
Why settle for one fortune...

11:58.958 --> 12:00.625
When you can have them all?

12:00.708 --> 12:02.583
Well, that sounds promising.

12:03.291 --> 12:05.250
Come, Olaf. You too, Miss Squalor.

12:05.333 --> 12:08.083
It's time you learned
why we're really on this mountain.

12:16.625 --> 12:18.708
[discordant music]

12:18.791 --> 12:21.416
[Quigley] It sounds like something
terrible is happening up there.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.750
I hope Violet can invent
a way up the waterfall.

12:24.375 --> 12:25.333
Look what I found.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.583
I salvaged these from the rubble.
See the names?

12:30.416 --> 12:31.416
[Klaus] Dr. Toronado.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.708
Father took us
to her engineering lectures.

12:34.708 --> 12:37.250
C.M. Comstock.
Mother gave me her book on female pirates.

12:37.333 --> 12:39.833
I know. That's where I learned
the Devil's Tongue Knot.

12:41.625 --> 12:43.041
[Klaus] Who's L. Snicket?

12:43.125 --> 12:45.333
I read his book on maps
and his tutorial on the accordion.

12:45.416 --> 12:48.166
It's like our parents were training us
for V.F.D. and we didn't know it.

12:48.250 --> 12:50.500
As if they knew
one day they wouldn't be here.

12:50.958 --> 12:52.375
Let's use what they gave us.

12:59.291 --> 13:02.083
[Lemony]  There are often people
in our lives who are not our parents,

13:02.166 --> 13:04.166
but who teach us important things.

13:04.250 --> 13:05.916
These people are called mentors.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.333
One of the great sadnesses
of the Baudelaire case

13:08.416 --> 13:13.250
is that Violet never got to work alongside
V.F.D.'s great inventors and researchers

13:13.333 --> 13:15.750
at their secret mountain headquarters,

13:15.833 --> 13:20.416
but she had read their work
in the books her parents had given her.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.041
Quigley, hand me the candelabra.

13:22.125 --> 13:26.166
[Lemony]  So when Violet used a candelabra
to hammer some damaged forks into shape,

13:26.250 --> 13:28.666
she could almost hear Dr. Toronado saying,

13:29.125 --> 13:32.041
"Mind the tines, Violet.
They can be delicate."

13:33.791 --> 13:34.625
[sighs]

13:38.666 --> 13:41.000
[Lemony]  When she took some strings
from a burnt ukulele,

13:41.083 --> 13:43.666
she imagined my good friend
Mrs. Comstock saying,

13:43.750 --> 13:46.083
"Have you considered the Sumac knot?"

13:48.250 --> 13:49.541
And when Violet said...

13:49.958 --> 13:51.583
It's time for a durability test.

13:51.666 --> 13:55.375
...it was almost as if she could hear
a man named Snicket say, "If this works,

13:56.375 --> 13:58.125
pistachios for everyone!"

14:01.000 --> 14:01.833
It works.

14:01.916 --> 14:04.166
Pistachios for everyone!

14:04.791 --> 14:07.208
Of course, not all mentors are good.

14:08.916 --> 14:11.458
Many years ago in my own organization,

14:11.541 --> 14:14.625
there were those who prayed
on impressionable minds

14:14.708 --> 14:16.833
by taking them in at a point in their life

14:16.916 --> 14:20.083
when they might be particularly lost
or vulnerable.

14:20.166 --> 14:21.833
[bearded man] You look lost.

14:21.916 --> 14:24.000
How can I be lost?
There are signs everywhere,

14:24.083 --> 14:26.041
which seems kind of dumb
for a secret organization.

14:26.125 --> 14:27.375
[woman] We mean figuratively.

14:29.666 --> 14:31.083
Who are you? Wait.

14:31.500 --> 14:34.333
You're that man with the hair and
the woman with the beard, or vice versa.

14:34.416 --> 14:35.333
I've heard about you.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.583
And vice versa.
We know what happened at the opera.

14:37.666 --> 14:39.750
[woman] And we know how you've spent
your nights since.

14:39.833 --> 14:41.000
Wandering these tunnels.

14:41.083 --> 14:42.375
-Directionless.
-Alone.

14:42.458 --> 14:45.000
-Have you been following me?
-With great interest, for some time.

14:45.083 --> 14:46.833
Your friends in V.F.D. betrayed you,

14:46.916 --> 14:49.916
but a young man with your talents
doesn't need friends.

14:50.000 --> 14:50.833
He needs guidance.

14:50.916 --> 14:52.166
I'll pass.

14:52.250 --> 14:54.291
I'm a tortured, brooding loner now.

14:54.375 --> 14:56.000
I've even taken up journaling.

14:56.708 --> 14:57.875
I'd rather be alone.

14:57.958 --> 14:59.125
Why, what a pity.

14:59.500 --> 15:00.916
There's so much we could teach you.

15:01.791 --> 15:05.041
[Lemony]  Bad mentors can lead you down
a slippery slope,

15:05.125 --> 15:08.833
whether you encounter them
years later at the top of a mountain,

15:09.458 --> 15:11.833
or you belong to their acting troupe.

15:12.875 --> 15:15.541
They've been in that tent for a while.
I wonder what they're planning.

15:15.625 --> 15:17.750
-I hope it's a picnic.
-It's never a picnic.

15:17.833 --> 15:18.833
Not anymore.

15:18.916 --> 15:21.333
I joined Count Olaf because I thought
he could teach me things,

15:21.416 --> 15:24.916
like how to harness my natural charisma
into a career in the performing arts.

15:25.291 --> 15:26.458
[sighs]

15:26.541 --> 15:29.083
But I'm beginning to question
my life choices.

15:29.166 --> 15:31.958
I know what you mean. I get the serious
creeps from those serious creeps.

15:32.041 --> 15:33.916
They definitely killed
those carnival freaks.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.916
-Oh, yeah.
-Dead as doornails.

15:36.583 --> 15:38.500
What do you think they're up to, baby?

15:42.333 --> 15:43.958
[Violet] The waterfall will be slippery.

15:44.041 --> 15:46.125
The tines on these forks
will dig into the ice.

15:46.208 --> 15:47.833
[Klaus] I think you should see this.

15:47.916 --> 15:50.250
I was searching to see
if any of the books survived the fire.

15:50.333 --> 15:52.541
-I found this in the poetry section.
-[Quigley] "Odes"?

15:55.166 --> 15:56.166
[Violet] "Codes."

15:56.250 --> 15:58.875
V.F.D. have a secret way
to leave coded messages in case of fires.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.541
There might be a message hidden now.

16:00.625 --> 16:03.750
Then somebody needs to find it.
Quigley, how are you at cracking codes?

16:03.833 --> 16:05.666
I can try, but I'm better at reading maps.

16:05.750 --> 16:08.833
You're better at climbing too.
I saw you in the Vertical Flame Diversion.

16:08.916 --> 16:11.583
You can help by saving Sunny.
I'll stay here and see what I can learn.

16:11.666 --> 16:12.625
Are you sure?

16:12.708 --> 16:15.458
You invented a way up the mountain.
Now it's my turn to use my talents.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.291
If Sunny's up there, we'll bring her back.

16:17.375 --> 16:18.250
I know you will.

16:22.666 --> 16:24.125
Thank you for volunteering.

16:25.875 --> 16:28.916
We'll use these to pull ourselves up
and test for thin ice so we don't fall.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.666
Not falling is an excellent plan.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.333
-Are you ready?
-If we wait until we're ready...

16:35.416 --> 16:37.541
We'll be waiting
for the rest of our lives.

16:49.333 --> 16:50.333
[grunting]

17:00.500 --> 17:02.041
[Violet gasps]

17:07.375 --> 17:08.583
[Quigley] We should rest.

17:09.875 --> 17:10.916
I see a ledge.

17:11.916 --> 17:13.416
It's not much further.

17:13.916 --> 17:15.541
[babbling]

17:15.625 --> 17:17.458
Look, I'm not happy about it either, okay?

17:18.000 --> 17:18.833
No way!

17:18.916 --> 17:21.916
This is totally different from
the last time we locked you in a birdcage.

17:22.250 --> 17:23.291
This birdcage is bigger.

17:24.458 --> 17:25.833
I think it's for trapping eagles.

17:28.375 --> 17:30.375
You're asking why a grown man
would knowingly engage

17:30.458 --> 17:31.833
in morally questionable behavior?

17:32.916 --> 17:34.625
You'll understand when you're older.

17:34.708 --> 17:35.625
Here, I got you.

17:40.833 --> 17:44.208
This ledge is solid. We should sit here
for a moment to get our strength back.

17:44.291 --> 17:47.416
Good idea. You're an excellent climber.
You're an excellent inventor.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.666
Thanks. But let's not celebrate yet.
There's a long way to go.

17:50.916 --> 17:54.416
Celebrate when you're half done
and the finish won't be quite as fun.

17:55.041 --> 17:56.000
My sister wrote that.

17:56.083 --> 17:58.250
Once we find Sunny,
we'll search for Duncan and Isadora.

17:59.083 --> 18:00.166
Your glove!

18:00.250 --> 18:01.708
We'll get it on the way down.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.916
If you have to hide a headquarters,
it's a beautiful place to do it.

18:07.041 --> 18:08.208
[Violet] It's a lovely view.

18:09.791 --> 18:11.083
Very lovely, indeed.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.458
[Lemony] Many things have been taken
from the Baudelaires

18:30.541 --> 18:32.458
since they lost their parents
and their home.

18:32.541 --> 18:35.041
One of those things is their privacy,
so...

18:37.041 --> 18:40.458
Instead of telling you about
the few moments shared between two friends

18:40.541 --> 18:43.708
on a chilly afternoon
halfway up a frozen waterfall,

18:43.791 --> 18:48.250
I will offer the eldest Baudelaire
this courtesy and...

18:49.666 --> 18:52.416
allow her to keep some moments to herself.

19:14.083 --> 19:16.791
Look, I didn't set out to be a henchperson
or an actor.

19:16.875 --> 19:18.375
I was gonna be a marine biologist.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.458
[grunting]

19:24.375 --> 19:26.833
[Violet gasps] It is Sunny. She's safe.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.625
How can we rescue her
with that hook-handed man standing guard?

19:32.333 --> 19:33.166
[babbling]

19:33.666 --> 19:35.083
We've got plenty of ice water.

19:35.166 --> 19:36.875
[babbling]

19:36.958 --> 19:39.666
I saw the boss chuck a half-empty bottle
of sarsaparilla down the road,

19:39.750 --> 19:41.666
but I'm not supposed to leave you alone.

19:45.375 --> 19:47.666
[sighs] Oh, don't give me that look.

19:49.875 --> 19:50.875
All right. Wait.

20:05.541 --> 20:06.375
Sunny.

20:07.333 --> 20:09.791
He's at the headquarters.
We're here to rescue you.

20:12.500 --> 20:16.250
This is Quigley, his brother. He survived
the fire. There's so much to tell you.

20:16.708 --> 20:18.375
[Olaf] Oh, babylaire!

20:25.375 --> 20:28.291
I thought of some more demeaning tasks
for you to perform.

20:28.375 --> 20:30.750
[Esmé] You're going to cook a very fancy,
very "in" dinner.

20:30.833 --> 20:33.375
Tonight, we're celebrating False Spring!

20:33.458 --> 20:35.125
That's not all we're celebrating.

20:35.208 --> 20:37.208
[chuckles wickedly]

20:38.375 --> 20:40.375
Where's Hooky?
I told him to wait right here.

20:40.833 --> 20:42.958
You seem to have trouble
controlling your underlings.

20:43.041 --> 20:45.583
Oh, yes, I like to let them roam.

20:45.958 --> 20:48.875
-You know, free-range henchpeople.
-[woman] We have a job for you.

20:48.958 --> 20:50.625
There's a camp in the woods.

20:50.708 --> 20:54.125
There you will find a tarp.
Bring it here and lay it over the road.

20:54.208 --> 20:56.416
That sounds like work.
Why do we have to do it?

20:56.500 --> 20:58.375
You'll do it because we say so.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.500
-That's a good point.
-Yeah.

21:00.583 --> 21:03.416
We've already yelled at the baby.
There's not much else to do here anyway.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.541
You're too concerned
about that baby, Olaf.

21:05.625 --> 21:09.416
After tonight, countless orphans
and their fortunes will be ours.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.208
Are you sure that they're all orphans?

21:11.291 --> 21:12.791
Not yet, they're not.

21:22.833 --> 21:24.875
[panting] Who were those horrible people?

21:24.958 --> 21:26.625
[babbling]

21:26.708 --> 21:29.000
They're the ones
who burned down V.F.D. headquarters?

21:31.625 --> 21:34.000
Let's go. I can strap you to my shoulders
and carry you down.

21:35.083 --> 21:36.500
You are. We came here to rescue you.

21:41.583 --> 21:43.166
Who's Mata Hari?

21:43.250 --> 21:46.416
She's the Dutch courtesan who spied
on Germany during World War One.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.416
Sunny's saying she wants
to stay here and spy.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.041
[babbling]

21:51.000 --> 21:53.166
Those villains were talking about
making more orphans.

21:53.250 --> 21:55.125
If Sunny could find out
what they're planning,

21:55.208 --> 21:57.500
we could prevent
this from happening to anyone else.

21:58.416 --> 22:01.125
I can't leave her behind.
She's my baby sister!

22:05.416 --> 22:07.666
[man] Hey, baby, you'd better
not be getting in trouble!

22:08.333 --> 22:09.625
He's coming back. We have to go.

22:09.708 --> 22:11.791
I can't leave you.
How are you gonna get out?

22:25.666 --> 22:27.000
[babbling]

22:35.541 --> 22:36.958
Here, take my lock pick.

22:37.041 --> 22:39.083
[Violet] You can use that toboggan
to escape.

22:39.166 --> 22:40.000
Violet!

22:40.791 --> 22:42.458
How did you get to be so brave?

22:44.541 --> 22:45.583
[whispers] Come on.

22:52.541 --> 22:54.958
I couldn't find the sarsaparilla,
but look what I got.

22:55.583 --> 22:56.958
Parsley soda!

22:57.291 --> 22:59.291
[panting]

22:59.916 --> 23:00.916
Did you find Sunny?

23:01.541 --> 23:03.791
She was the one who was sending
the signal. She's safe.

23:03.875 --> 23:05.458
She knows
who burned down the headquarters.

23:05.541 --> 23:06.708
A man with a beard but no hair.

23:06.791 --> 23:09.458
And a woman with hair but no beard.
Count Olaf was afraid of them.

23:09.541 --> 23:11.541
-And you left her?
-They're planning something bad.

23:11.625 --> 23:13.375
They were talking about
making more orphans.

23:13.458 --> 23:16.291
[inhales deeply]
Sunny wanted to spy to find out more.

23:16.375 --> 23:19.166
-She's just a baby. She can't be a spy.
-She's not a baby anymore.

23:19.666 --> 23:22.583
She's gonna meet us down here
as soon as she finds out anything.

23:22.666 --> 23:24.250
It was her idea. She insisted.

23:24.333 --> 23:26.291
-She insisted?
-She volunteered.

23:32.333 --> 23:35.291
-Then I guess we have to trust her.
-What choice do we have?

23:39.625 --> 23:40.750
Did you find anything?

23:42.291 --> 23:44.875
I found V.F.D. If you were in a building
about to be burnt down

23:44.958 --> 23:46.250
and you had to protect something,

23:46.333 --> 23:47.875
-where would you hide it?
-A safe.

23:47.958 --> 23:49.666
Assume you didn't have time
to open the safe.

23:49.750 --> 23:51.791
-The refrigerator.
-Exactly. So I searched the fridge.

23:51.875 --> 23:52.958
[Quigley] What did you find?

23:54.541 --> 23:55.833
Verbal Fridge Dialogue.

23:56.500 --> 23:57.416
Verbal Fridge Dialogue?

23:57.500 --> 24:00.208
Verbal Fridge Dialogue. It's a code
used in emergency situations.

24:00.291 --> 24:03.708
If you can't send a message, you leave one
using the items you find in the fridge.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Listen to this.

24:06.500 --> 24:09.333
"The darkest of the jams of three
contains the sender, look and see.”

24:09.416 --> 24:11.083
That sounds like one of Isadora's poems.

24:11.166 --> 24:13.041
She learned to write couplets
from our parents.

24:13.916 --> 24:17.833
Well, the poem means that the name
of the person sending the message

24:17.916 --> 24:19.083
is in the darkest jar of jam.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.291
The darkest jam is boysenberry.

24:22.916 --> 24:23.833
J.S.

24:23.916 --> 24:25.708
-Jacques Snicket?
-But Jacques Snicket's dead.

24:25.791 --> 24:28.333
That's not the only thing that's strange
about this message.

24:28.708 --> 24:31.333
"Gatherings use
a cured fruit-based calendar,

24:31.416 --> 24:34.000
and location can be divined
via any spice-based condiment."

24:34.083 --> 24:36.750
J.S. is calling a meeting
for the whole of V.F.D.

24:38.166 --> 24:40.625
The number of olives
is the day of the week it is.

24:40.916 --> 24:42.500
One for Sunday, two for Monday.

24:42.583 --> 24:44.208
-There are five olives.
-Thursday.

24:44.291 --> 24:46.583
If this message was left during the fire,
then...

24:46.666 --> 24:48.166
the gathering's less than a week away.

24:48.250 --> 24:49.541
But where is it?

24:49.625 --> 24:51.666
The only spice-based condiment
is this jar of mustard.

24:51.750 --> 24:52.958
[Klaus] Read the ingredients.

24:53.041 --> 24:55.416
"Vinegar, mustard seed, salt, turmeric,

24:55.500 --> 24:57.291
the Last Safe Place."

24:58.250 --> 24:59.541
The Last Safe Place.

24:59.625 --> 25:01.833
If we find the Last Safe Place,
we can find V.F.D.

25:01.916 --> 25:03.291
I don't know where that is.

25:03.375 --> 25:06.041
If the answer was in this library,
then it's gone up in smoke.

25:06.875 --> 25:08.500
Maybe Sunny can learn something.

25:09.666 --> 25:11.333
We'll keep an eye out for her.

25:16.583 --> 25:18.041
False spring rolls.

25:20.041 --> 25:21.250
[muttering]

25:21.333 --> 25:22.750
The bossery.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.000
Do you see that?

25:27.083 --> 25:28.000
There it is again.

25:28.083 --> 25:29.541
A little flicker of light,

25:29.625 --> 25:31.250
-like a spyglass.
-[man] A volunteer?

25:31.333 --> 25:32.541
Go fetch them, Olaf.

25:33.375 --> 25:36.125
Me? I don't wanna. Make the baby.

25:36.208 --> 25:38.666
This is no job for a baby.
If there's a volunteer down there...

25:38.750 --> 25:40.500
-They may have the sugar bowl.
-I'll go!

25:40.583 --> 25:41.958
I'll go!   I'll go!

25:42.958 --> 25:44.083
I'm always happy to help.

25:44.166 --> 25:46.666
I'll just slip into something
more horrifying and pop right down.

25:48.875 --> 25:50.291
The baby is watching us.

25:50.375 --> 25:51.958
-Cover the cage!
-Cover the cage!

25:52.041 --> 25:54.291
Cover the cage! Shh!

25:57.541 --> 25:58.958
I was gonna say it first.

26:00.958 --> 26:02.000
Sorry, baby.

26:04.625 --> 26:06.500
[Quigley] There's someone
coming down that slope!

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
It must be Sunny!

26:10.250 --> 26:13.000
[Klaus] I don't think so. Whoever it is,
they're too tall to be Sunny.

26:14.375 --> 26:16.833
That's strange.
Yeah, it looks like they're on fire.

26:20.125 --> 26:21.333
[Violet] It's not fire.

26:21.875 --> 26:23.333
-It's fashion.
-Esmé.

26:23.416 --> 26:26.083
[whooping]

26:27.250 --> 26:30.166
[whooping]

26:30.250 --> 26:32.166
[sighing]

26:32.250 --> 26:33.625
[yelling]

26:35.208 --> 26:36.791
[crashing]

26:36.875 --> 26:38.000
[bottles tinkle]

26:45.625 --> 26:48.458
I thought you volunteers
were supposed to be smart,

26:48.541 --> 26:52.875
but if someone is still lurking around,
that's very stupid.

26:52.958 --> 26:54.666
Your headquarters are destroyed,

26:54.750 --> 26:58.875
your worst enemies
are on top of that mountain,

26:59.375 --> 27:00.666
and I'm right here...

27:01.208 --> 27:02.875
and dressed to kill.

27:06.791 --> 27:07.833
[Esmé] Boo!

27:07.916 --> 27:09.541
You're short for a volunteer,

27:09.625 --> 27:12.750
but I've always said
reading stunts your growth.

27:13.166 --> 27:15.541
Don't run. I just want to torture you

27:15.625 --> 27:18.500
until you give me the location
of the sugar bowl.

27:19.125 --> 27:21.583
You once threw a masked ball here
and didn't invite me.

27:21.666 --> 27:22.875
Not that I care.

27:23.500 --> 27:26.125
A face this gorgeous
should never be hidden behind a mask.

27:29.541 --> 27:30.583
Are you in the kitchen?

27:33.708 --> 27:37.791
Perhaps you're hiding in...
whatever this room is. The...

27:37.875 --> 27:38.958
Oh, right.

27:39.500 --> 27:40.750
It's the hot tub room.

27:41.166 --> 27:42.500
You'd better come out now.

27:43.291 --> 27:44.583
When I get my hands on you,

27:44.666 --> 27:48.166
skinning you alive will be the second
worst thing I've done in a hot tub.

27:48.250 --> 27:49.250
[snapping]

27:49.666 --> 27:51.375
-[creaking]
-Argh!

27:51.458 --> 27:53.333
[crashing]

27:53.875 --> 27:55.291
I think we just trapped Esmé Squalor

27:55.375 --> 27:57.583
at the bottom
of a surprisingly deep hot tub.

27:57.666 --> 27:58.833
Is she alive?

28:06.458 --> 28:07.833
Get me out of here at once!

28:07.916 --> 28:12.500
Being trapped in a hot tub is even less
"in" than getting in a hot tub on purpose.

28:12.583 --> 28:13.666
She's alive.

28:13.750 --> 28:16.166
-I can make a pulley to get her out.
-Or...

28:18.833 --> 28:20.416
-Or?
-Get me out of here!

28:20.500 --> 28:23.166
Count Olaf has someone you love.
Now we have someone he loves.

28:23.250 --> 28:25.250
-We could arrange a trade.
-An exchange of hostages.

28:25.333 --> 28:28.208
When my boyfriend finds out
that you trapped me down here,

28:28.291 --> 28:30.875
he is going to be so angry!

28:30.958 --> 28:32.666
Olaf captures people to get what he wants.

28:32.750 --> 28:34.541
You really want to do
the same thing as him?

28:34.625 --> 28:36.083
You have to fight fire with fire.

28:36.166 --> 28:39.041
If everyone fought fire with fire,
the world would go up in smoke.

28:39.125 --> 28:39.958
Klaus is right.

28:40.041 --> 28:41.791
-There has to be another way.
-[Esmé] Klaus?

28:42.541 --> 28:45.583
Oh, this is rich.

28:46.208 --> 28:48.833
You're not volunteers at all.
You're Baudelaires!

28:48.916 --> 28:51.416
Olaf will be so disappointed
you didn't die

28:51.500 --> 28:53.125
when he dropped you off that mountain.

28:53.208 --> 28:57.125
Of course, he'll be thrilled.
He'll get to kill you all over again.

28:58.166 --> 28:59.166
You...

28:59.250 --> 29:02.291
Didn't you float off
in a bunch of balloons?

29:02.375 --> 29:04.041
I'm Quigley Quagmire. I survived the fire.

29:04.125 --> 29:07.750
Sheesh, some days
you just can't catch a break.

29:07.833 --> 29:10.125
We'll get you out, but only
if you help get our sister back.

29:10.208 --> 29:12.750
And what if I refuse?

29:14.125 --> 29:16.541
That's the problem
with your side of the schism.

29:16.625 --> 29:19.791
Being righteous and well-read
never gets you anywhere.

29:20.541 --> 29:23.166
When I was your age, I was supposed
to waste my entire summer

29:23.250 --> 29:24.208
reading  Anna Karenina.

29:24.291 --> 29:27.791
I knew that dumb book would never
help me, so I threw it in the fireplace.

29:27.875 --> 29:29.708
And look at me now!

29:30.125 --> 29:33.333
I'm beautiful and fashionable!

29:33.416 --> 29:34.875
You're trapped in a hot tub.

29:34.958 --> 29:36.708
And I'm still better off than you!

29:36.791 --> 29:38.833
You'll never save your sister,

29:39.416 --> 29:41.291
just like you'll never save
those rich kids

29:41.375 --> 29:43.625
hiking up Mount Fraught
to celebrate False Spring.

29:43.708 --> 29:44.541
False Spring?

29:44.625 --> 29:46.375
-"Countless orphans."
-"Countless fortunes."

29:46.458 --> 29:48.833
They're gonna kidnap the Snow Scouts
and murder their parents.

29:51.833 --> 29:53.458
[Scout leader] Carmelita! Carmelita!

29:53.541 --> 29:54.375
[panting]

29:54.458 --> 29:56.458
Carmelita, maybe we could turn back.

29:56.541 --> 29:58.375
I can't feel my toes,
and this luggage is heavy.

29:59.166 --> 30:00.208
[giggles]

30:00.291 --> 30:02.500
You'll turn back
when I say you can turn back...

30:02.583 --> 30:03.666
At the top of Mount Fraught,

30:03.750 --> 30:06.708
after I've been crowned
False Spring Queen!

30:06.791 --> 30:10.333
I told you, False Spring Queen
is a democratically elected position.

30:10.416 --> 30:12.708
Only cakesniffers care about democracy!

30:12.791 --> 30:13.958
Who put you in charge?

30:14.041 --> 30:17.458
All of your extremely wealthy parents,
although I am starting to suspect

30:17.541 --> 30:19.875
they had their own reasons
for sending you out into the wild.

30:19.958 --> 30:24.166
Well, maybe I'm tired of taking orders
from a lady who smells like cats.

30:24.250 --> 30:27.083
Who wants to abandon the scout leader
on the side of the road

30:27.166 --> 30:29.333
where she'll starve and go feral

30:29.416 --> 30:31.250
and have to survive by eating dirt?

30:31.333 --> 30:33.541
[cheering]

30:33.625 --> 30:36.708
Now follow me like the queen I am!

30:37.416 --> 30:38.666
[Carmelita] Mush! Mush!

30:38.750 --> 30:39.750
[Scout leader] But...

30:44.625 --> 30:45.666
I'm free.

30:45.750 --> 30:47.625
[panting]

30:47.708 --> 30:49.791
[woman shouting] Mush! Mush!

30:49.875 --> 30:52.083
Mush, mush, mush!

30:52.166 --> 30:54.458
Mush, mush, mush!

30:54.541 --> 30:57.250
I wish you'd stop saying that.
It's not helping.

30:57.333 --> 31:00.041
Well, I wish you would mush faster.

31:00.125 --> 31:01.375
I still don't like this plan.

31:01.458 --> 31:03.458
Me neither, but what choice do we have?

31:03.541 --> 31:05.666
Mush, mush, mush!

31:05.750 --> 31:09.166
We stand on the brink
of our greatest triumph.

31:09.250 --> 31:10.750
[woman] A troupe of Snow Scouts

31:10.833 --> 31:14.416
from the wealthiest families in the city
are on their way here right now.

31:14.500 --> 31:17.083
[Bearded man] We'll capture every one
of those uniformed brats,

31:17.166 --> 31:20.583
and each of them will be offered
the exciting opportunity to join us.

31:21.833 --> 31:23.333
What if they refuse?

31:23.416 --> 31:25.125
We'll burn down their parents' homes.

31:25.208 --> 31:26.916
With their parents inside.

31:27.375 --> 31:28.666
That happened to our home.

31:28.750 --> 31:29.958
That happened to our parents.

31:30.291 --> 31:32.625
To be clear, we're going to kidnap
a bunch of rich kids,

31:32.708 --> 31:34.708
eliminate their parents
in a series of arsons,

31:34.791 --> 31:38.000
then, while waiting for them to come
of age so we can seize their fortunes,

31:38.083 --> 31:41.208
indoctrinate them via a combination
of emotionallydistant parenting

31:41.291 --> 31:42.458
and Stockholm Syndrome?

31:42.541 --> 31:45.750
Oh, Olaf, we're not emotionally distant.
You just didn't deserve praise.

31:45.833 --> 31:47.666
[man] We took you in in your darkest hour

31:47.750 --> 31:50.750
because we saw a spark in you
bright enough to light a thousand fires.

31:50.833 --> 31:51.666
But look at you now.

31:51.750 --> 31:54.166
[woman] Your obsession
with the Baudelaires is a disgrace.

31:54.250 --> 31:57.125
It has led to your defeat and humiliation.

31:57.208 --> 31:59.916
But that's all in the past.
The Baudelaires are dead to me.

32:00.458 --> 32:01.583
Not all of them.

32:04.708 --> 32:07.500
But if I kill the baby, then I'll never
get the Baudelaire fortune.

32:07.583 --> 32:08.625
[Bearded man] Precisely.

32:08.708 --> 32:10.708
You think you deserve our respect?

32:10.791 --> 32:11.708
Our love?

32:12.291 --> 32:14.708
Then do something
for once in your pathetic life!

32:14.791 --> 32:17.833
Throw Sunny Baudelaire off that cliff!

32:19.125 --> 32:19.958
[sniffs]

32:21.416 --> 32:22.250
[exhales]

32:23.416 --> 32:24.958
[exhales]

32:25.041 --> 32:28.791
[Bearded man] Be a man and slay that baby,
putz.

32:30.833 --> 32:32.916
As we say in the theater...

32:35.041 --> 32:36.000
Toss her.

32:38.833 --> 32:41.583
I gave you an order.
Throw that baby off the mountain!

32:41.666 --> 32:43.916
-No!
-What do you mean "no"?

32:44.000 --> 32:46.875
-We mean no.
-We're done participating in your schemes.

32:46.958 --> 32:49.333
We lost our parents and our home
in a fire.

32:49.416 --> 32:51.250
We're starting to think
it wasn't a coincidence.

32:51.333 --> 32:52.333
We lost our sister, too.

32:52.416 --> 32:56.083
I don't care
about some late-series backstory!

32:56.166 --> 32:58.375
You will obey my order this instant!

32:58.458 --> 33:00.416
-We love you...
-And we'd do anything for love.

33:00.500 --> 33:01.875
But we won't do that.

33:01.958 --> 33:02.791
You...

33:03.291 --> 33:06.375
Fine. I don't need
those pasty-faced prunes anyway!

33:07.875 --> 33:10.125
You! Dispose of that baby!

33:10.208 --> 33:11.541
It's a slippery slope.

33:11.625 --> 33:14.458
No, it's a frozen waterfall.
Now throw the baby off it.

33:14.541 --> 33:15.916
I meant that figuratively.

33:16.583 --> 33:17.666
I need some space.

33:17.750 --> 33:19.541
I'm definitely questioning
my life choices.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.583
[muttering] You're quest--
your life choice--

33:27.750 --> 33:28.791
Be good to Esmé.

33:41.625 --> 33:43.958
You seem to have lost all your underlings.

33:45.666 --> 33:46.750
I don't need them.

33:46.833 --> 33:48.125
I don't need any of them.

33:48.208 --> 33:52.041
I'm an individual practitioner, and I can
throw a baby off a mountain on my own!

33:52.125 --> 33:54.416
You're not on your own, boss.
You've still got me.

33:57.500 --> 33:58.708
[Hook-Handed Man groans]

34:02.333 --> 34:03.291
No!

34:04.333 --> 34:05.375
My fortune!

34:08.583 --> 34:10.541
At last, after all these years...

34:10.625 --> 34:12.583
We have eliminated the Baudelaires.

34:12.666 --> 34:15.166
I've got some bad news about that.

34:15.250 --> 34:17.708
-My fortune!
-The Baudelaires!

34:17.791 --> 34:19.125
[Esmé] And look who else I found.

34:19.208 --> 34:21.833
-That's Quigleforth Quagmire.
-Quigley.

34:21.916 --> 34:24.291
I've never been so happy
to see you brats alive!

34:24.375 --> 34:25.958
How did you capture them, my pet?

34:26.041 --> 34:28.541
She didn't capture us.
We're here to trade her as a hostage.

34:29.291 --> 34:30.291
[sniggering]

34:34.958 --> 34:37.833
Like I've never had to free myself from
a chair being hoisted up a mountain.

34:37.916 --> 34:40.666
I was going to use this big knife
to force them to carry me up,

34:40.750 --> 34:42.916
but these volunteers just volunteered.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.125
[laughing]

34:44.208 --> 34:45.625
[whispering] They're so stupid.

34:46.666 --> 34:50.041
Well, we may not have a hostage,
but we're not leaving without Sunny.

34:50.125 --> 34:51.666
Sunny Baudelaire's dead.

34:53.250 --> 34:55.125
-No!
-Oh, yes. My favorite henchperson

34:55.208 --> 34:57.208
just tossed her off that cliff
not moments ago.

34:57.291 --> 34:58.250
I'm your favorite?

34:58.333 --> 35:00.166
I'm surprised
you didn't see it on the way down.

35:00.250 --> 35:01.833
How could you do that to her?

35:01.916 --> 35:03.791
It was easy.
He just picked her up and...

35:03.875 --> 35:06.041
Eeee...

35:06.125 --> 35:07.000
No!

35:07.083 --> 35:11.125
And it all worked out
because now I have you!

35:11.208 --> 35:12.708
[laughing]

35:12.791 --> 35:14.291
[Olaf] You made me choose,

35:14.375 --> 35:16.750
and I still got everything I wanted!

35:16.833 --> 35:19.541
Because I am amazing, brainy,

35:20.125 --> 35:23.041
courageous, dashing, enchanting,

35:23.125 --> 35:26.333
famished, gifted, hilarious,

35:26.416 --> 35:29.625
in.. in... in... What's a good word
to describe me that starts with an "I"?

35:29.708 --> 35:32.000
Idiot. You disappoint us, Olaf.

35:32.416 --> 35:34.416
-We'll do better with the next recruits.
-[chanting]

35:34.500 --> 35:35.500
Here they come now.

35:35.583 --> 35:36.833
[all chanting] ...basic, calm,

35:36.916 --> 35:39.208
darling, emblematic, frisky, grinning,

35:39.291 --> 35:41.208
human, innocent, jumping, kept,

35:41.291 --> 35:44.208
limited, meek, nap-loving,
official, pretty...

35:45.250 --> 35:47.000
scheduled, tidy...

35:47.083 --> 35:49.375
-What are all you cakesniffers doing here?
-Carmelita!

35:49.458 --> 35:51.208
Hello, little girl.

35:51.291 --> 35:54.000
We're here to help you celebrate
False Spring.

35:54.083 --> 35:56.708
Carmelita, they're not here
to help you celebrate False Spring.

35:56.791 --> 35:59.708
-They're here to kidnap you!
-I'm too adorable to kidnap.

35:59.791 --> 36:00.791
Give me that Springpole!

36:00.875 --> 36:03.166
Please turn around and lead
the Snow Scouts some place safe!

36:03.250 --> 36:05.333
Pay no attention to those cry-babies.

36:05.416 --> 36:06.500
Why don't you step closer?

36:07.791 --> 36:08.708
No, Carmelita!

36:08.791 --> 36:11.833
I crown myself False Spring Queen!

36:13.208 --> 36:15.916
[woman] Now, the rest of you children,

36:16.000 --> 36:20.000
take a few steps closer
and join us in a special celebration.

36:20.083 --> 36:21.125
-No!
-It's a trap!

36:21.208 --> 36:22.083
[whistling]

36:22.166 --> 36:23.625
[roaring]

36:24.208 --> 36:25.458
[screeching]

36:30.291 --> 36:31.625
-No!
-No!

36:33.625 --> 36:34.791
[screaming]

36:34.875 --> 36:35.708
No!

36:35.791 --> 36:38.000
[screaming continues]

36:53.708 --> 36:55.791
The noble side of the schism
may have the carrier crows

36:55.875 --> 36:57.166
and the trained reptiles...

36:57.250 --> 36:58.875
But the eagles work for us,

36:58.958 --> 37:00.750
-and so will those children.
-No.

37:01.916 --> 37:03.666
We were prepared to take you back, Olaf.

37:03.750 --> 37:05.541
[man] Instead, we're taking your car.

37:07.625 --> 37:10.083
-How did you steal my keys?
-We'll be in touch.

37:10.166 --> 37:12.875
-That would be a first.
-I was talking to Ms. Squalor.

37:12.958 --> 37:14.375
[man] We're impressed with your work.

37:14.458 --> 37:16.625
We'll contact you
with your next assignment.

37:16.708 --> 37:20.083
My God! Really? Oh, you're so sweet!

37:20.166 --> 37:21.750
- Safe travels!
-[car engine starts]

37:23.541 --> 37:25.833
-We have to get out of here.
-You're not going anywhere!

37:25.916 --> 37:29.416
I only need to keep one of you alive
to get your fortune.

37:29.708 --> 37:31.458
Which one should it be?

37:31.541 --> 37:32.750
You should keep Klaus!

37:32.833 --> 37:35.333
Then you could smash his glasses
and watch him bump into things!

37:35.416 --> 37:37.791
What an adorable little girl.
Would you like to join us?

37:37.875 --> 37:39.833
We should discuss that first.

37:40.333 --> 37:41.791
Oh!

37:41.875 --> 37:45.166
Hey, cakesniffers, now I have
two sets of parents more than you!

37:45.250 --> 37:47.083
Any last words?

37:53.625 --> 37:54.916
[gasping]

37:59.875 --> 38:01.916
[screaming]

38:08.500 --> 38:10.750
After them!

38:12.666 --> 38:14.458
In what, boss? We don't have a car.

38:15.166 --> 38:17.166
[screaming]

38:24.625 --> 38:26.958
You know,
I swear she was in that cage, boss.

38:27.041 --> 38:29.125
I will deal with you later.

38:31.708 --> 38:34.250
-I'm glad to have you back, Sunny.
-Me too, but we're not safe yet.

38:41.041 --> 38:43.125
Quigley, does your map say
where this stream is headed?

38:43.208 --> 38:47.041
Streams run into larger bodies of water,
like rivers, and rivers lead into--

38:47.625 --> 38:48.708
Argh!

38:49.708 --> 38:50.833
-Quigley!
-Violet!

38:52.333 --> 38:55.083
Violet!
Quigley!

39:00.958 --> 39:04.500
Despite my many years investigating
the case of the Baudelaire orphans,

39:04.583 --> 39:06.916
there is still much I do not know.

39:07.416 --> 39:10.833
I do not know if Violet Baudelaire
ever visited the Mortmain Mountains

39:10.916 --> 39:12.541
-with Quigley Quagmire again.
-Quigley!

39:12.625 --> 39:13.666
Last Safe Place!

39:14.291 --> 39:16.250
I'll find you at the Last Safe Place!

39:24.416 --> 39:27.541
[Lemony]  I do not know what happened
to the members of Count Olaf's troupe

39:27.625 --> 39:29.458
after they walked away down Mount Fraught.

39:29.541 --> 39:31.833
Maybe we can buy a little farm
and grow rutabagas.

39:31.916 --> 39:34.583
I thought we could go to a music hall
and pick up sailors.

39:34.666 --> 39:35.916
Where do we go from here?

39:39.250 --> 39:40.541
It's a crossroads.

39:40.916 --> 39:42.875
But there is one thing I do know.

39:43.500 --> 39:45.208
I do know where the Baudelaires went next

39:45.291 --> 39:48.833
as their toboggan rushed down
the frozen waters of Stricken Stream.

39:48.916 --> 39:51.708
[cracking, rumbling]

39:52.833 --> 39:56.791
I know this because of the stanza
in a long and complicated poem

39:56.875 --> 40:00.625
circled in an old book by a woman
who was a fierce volunteer,

40:00.708 --> 40:03.375
a brave mother, and a loyal sibling.

40:03.458 --> 40:05.041
The stanza is this:

40:07.083 --> 40:09.000
That no life lives forever...

40:13.125 --> 40:15.083
That dead men rise up never...

40:18.083 --> 40:19.500
That even the weariest river...

40:21.208 --> 40:23.375
winds somewhere safe to sea.

40:24.708 --> 40:26.708
[panting]

40:28.916 --> 40:30.208
[thunder rumbles]

40:32.166 --> 40:34.166
[cracking]

40:48.208 --> 40:50.208
[rumbling]

41:03.041 --> 41:05.250
I can't thank you enough
for driving me back to the city.

41:05.333 --> 41:08.500
No trouble at all. Though when you offered
me a ride, I did assume you had a car.

41:08.583 --> 41:10.916
I completely forgot
that it fell off that cliff.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.208
Lucky it was only a half day's hike
to your taxi.

41:13.291 --> 41:16.083
-It was my brother's taxi.
-You'll have to thank him for me.

41:16.166 --> 41:17.166
He's dead.

41:17.250 --> 41:18.250
[splutters]

41:19.625 --> 41:20.500
Granola bar?

41:20.583 --> 41:22.583
-[phone ringing]
-Oh...

41:22.666 --> 41:24.000
That's me.

41:24.583 --> 41:26.208
You've had a phone this whole time?

41:26.291 --> 41:27.958
Yes, Mr. Tamerlane?
Are you in the office?

41:28.041 --> 41:30.083
No, Mr. Tamerlane.
I'm just arriving back in the city.

41:30.166 --> 41:32.666
I don't want to jinx it, but I think
I found a wonderful candidate

41:32.750 --> 41:35.041
to fill that vacant
administrative assistant position.

41:35.125 --> 41:37.416
No one cares. Get back to work.
The whole town's on fire.

41:37.500 --> 41:38.333
A fire, you say?

41:39.708 --> 41:40.875
Multiple fires?

41:41.333 --> 41:42.333
Good heavens, where?

41:43.916 --> 41:44.916
All over the city?

41:45.958 --> 41:47.041
Think of the orphans.

41:47.500 --> 41:48.666
Think of the fortunes.

41:49.666 --> 41:52.875
[Poe]  The Department of Orphan Affairs
is going to be buzzing, Mr. Tamerlane!

41:52.958 --> 41:54.458
To fighting fire with fire.

41:54.541 --> 41:56.833
And watching the world go up in smoke.

41:59.083 --> 42:01.083
[screeching]

42:04.458 --> 42:06.791
[screaming]

42:07.458 --> 42:09.458
[theme music playing]
