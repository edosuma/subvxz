WEBVTT

00:06.875 --> 00:09.291
(male on loudspeaker)
'Whoo-wee, what a doozy,
folks.'

00:09.375 --> 00:11.041
'It's only an exhibition game'

00:11.125 --> 00:13.333
'but it's had all
the drama of a seventh game'

00:13.417 --> 00:15.041
'of the World Series.'

00:15.125 --> 00:17.834
It's the bottom of the ninth
and the negro league All-Stars

00:17.917 --> 00:19.875
are dead even
with the major leaguers

00:19.959 --> 00:21.959
at three apiece.

00:22.041 --> 00:25.333
'At bat for the negro
leaguers,
Clyde Taylor'

00:25.417 --> 00:27.625
'already two doubles
and a single.'

00:27.709 --> 00:30.500
This kid has
been sensational.

00:30.583 --> 00:32.625
(male #1)
'Show him how
it's done, Rookie.'

00:36.166 --> 00:37.125
Time.

00:44.625 --> 00:46.125
Looky here

00:46.208 --> 00:48.417
what'd I tell you, Jackie?

00:48.500 --> 00:50.125
Man is shakin'
in his shoes.

00:50.208 --> 00:51.834
No, you watch.

00:51.917 --> 00:54.041
Young fella's
gonna be just fine.

00:54.125 --> 00:55.500
'He's got a ton of guts.'

00:55.583 --> 00:57.041
How's this one grab you?

01:01.000 --> 01:03.208
Just right.
Thanks, Crumbs.

01:03.291 --> 01:04.709
Make us famous, would you?

01:16.291 --> 01:19.375
Money, marbles or
chalk,
gentlemen?

01:19.458 --> 01:22.417
I'm taking all bets
my rookie hits this
ball

01:22.500 --> 01:24.500
'clear over the grandstand.'

01:25.959 --> 01:29.375
You can do it, Honey Pie.
Just one more pitch. This is
it.

01:30.875 --> 01:33.291
I'll send you back to the
cotton
fields, you hear me, boy?

01:35.959 --> 01:37.959
The count is three and two.

01:38.041 --> 01:40.792
'Here's the wind-up..'

01:40.875 --> 01:42.583
'...and the pitch.'

02:06.542 --> 02:08.041
Yes.

02:48.417 --> 02:51.041
Alright, Leonard,
you just wait for yours
now.

02:51.125 --> 02:52.917
Keep your eye on that ball.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.917
You can do it.
Wait for your
pitch.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.041
Alright, come on,
Leonard.
Good eye. You can do it.

02:58.125 --> 02:59.417
'Watch that ball.'

03:04.667 --> 03:06.917
- How old is he now?
- Eleven.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.208
He didn't get that good
Jeffries size, did he?

03:09.291 --> 03:10.792
(Will)
'His mom's an
itty-bitty thing.'

03:10.875 --> 03:13.000
I'll tell you what,
kid's got a motor on
him.

03:13.083 --> 03:14.417
He's fast, huh?

03:14.500 --> 03:16.166
Problem is, can't
hit
the ball to save his
life

03:16.250 --> 03:18.500
and never gets on base.

03:18.583 --> 03:20.166
Hey, Uncle Will.
Mr. Stillman.

03:20.250 --> 03:22.625
Hey, Leonard.
Looking good out there, son.

03:22.709 --> 03:24.208
If I could only
hit the dang ball.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.542
(Stillman)
'Aw, the hits will come.'

03:25.625 --> 03:27.750
- You've got the mechanics.
- I do?

03:27.834 --> 03:29.125
What have I been
telling you?

03:29.208 --> 03:31.458
Still, I'm no Clyde Taylor.

03:31.542 --> 03:33.667
[chuckles]
Let's get you
home.

03:33.750 --> 03:35.792
Oh, who's Clyde Taylor?

03:35.875 --> 03:38.125
- You never heard of him?
- Uh-uh.

03:38.208 --> 03:39.792
He was the best
of the best.

03:39.875 --> 03:42.291
Maybe even better
than Babe Ruth, right?

03:42.375 --> 03:44.083
That's what my pops
used to tell me.

03:44.166 --> 03:46.458
Took the old negro leagues
by storm.

03:46.542 --> 03:47.959
But not for very long.

03:48.041 --> 03:49.959
'Cause somebody
killed him, right?

03:50.041 --> 03:51.709
- That's true.
- Who?

03:51.792 --> 03:54.458
- No one ever knew.
- Not even the police?

03:54.542 --> 03:55.959
Sometimes there's
no good evidence.

03:56.041 --> 03:57.709
The police have
to put the case away.

03:57.792 --> 03:59.417
And we're left
with just a
mystery.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.125
But what if it was
the Babe who got murdered?

04:02.208 --> 04:03.792
I mean, instead of Clyde.

04:03.875 --> 04:06.834
Would the olden day cops
let that be a mystery?

04:50.917 --> 04:52.834
Clyde Taylor, 20.
Beaten to death.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.083
Next to his car
outside Connie Mack Stadium.

04:55.166 --> 04:56.875
No return to the scene
of the crime.

04:56.959 --> 04:58.750
The stadium was
torn down in the '70s.

04:58.834 --> 05:00.834
Body was found
after an exhibition game

05:00.917 --> 05:02.500
between the negro league
All-Stars

05:02.583 --> 05:04.208
and a group
of major leaguers.

05:04.291 --> 05:06.542
They found him
still in his
uniform.

05:06.625 --> 05:08.375
Assigned has down
there was a smear

05:08.458 --> 05:09.709
on the front
of his jersey.

05:09.792 --> 05:11.542
- 'Yeah?'
- A tobacco stain.

05:11.625 --> 05:13.375
(Rush)
'The backside
was caked in blood.'

05:13.458 --> 05:16.166
Oh, story went, Clyde
was attacked from
behind.

05:16.250 --> 05:17.750
Struck down with
his very own bat.

05:17.834 --> 05:20.375
Which adds up, his gear bag
and mitt were found next to
him.

05:20.458 --> 05:22.875
- The bat was missing.
- '40s was different era.

05:22.959 --> 05:24.959
Ball players lugging
around their own gear.

05:25.041 --> 05:27.542
Might explain why
Clyde had his uniform
on.

05:27.625 --> 05:30.208
Colored players probably
weren't allowed to
shower.

05:30.291 --> 05:31.875
Hmm. Suspects?

05:31.959 --> 05:35.250
They were looking at Tyler
Cage.
The losing pitcher.

05:35.333 --> 05:37.250
The one Clyde hit a home run
off to win the game.

05:37.333 --> 05:40.083
The players heard him jawing
at Clyde using racial slurs.

05:40.166 --> 05:41.834
(Will)
'But ultimately he had a
alibi.'

05:41.917 --> 05:44.041
Postgame press conference
hadn't even started.

05:44.125 --> 05:45.583
Cage was seen
across town
drinking

05:45.667 --> 05:47.792
away his postgame blues.

05:49.166 --> 05:51.208
Located the "Last to see."

05:51.291 --> 05:54.083
Mr. Joe Crumbly.
Goes by Crumbs.

06:00.208 --> 06:02.917
(Will)
'Mr. Crumbly, you were
the clubhouse manager'

06:03.000 --> 06:05.333
'for Clyde's team,
the Philly Steel-Drivers?'

06:05.417 --> 06:06.750
Check.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.000
Also on board
for the All-Star game

06:09.083 --> 06:11.250
the day Clyde was killed.

06:11.333 --> 06:13.875
You two were the last
ones
out of the locker room.

06:13.959 --> 06:15.000
Check.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.125
Clyde wanted to avoid
the spotlight.

06:17.208 --> 06:19.417
So, he waited for the mob
to die down.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.583
Hammers a homer
and then liked to lay low?

06:21.667 --> 06:23.792
That's how he was.

06:23.875 --> 06:25.959
So, I pick up the slack.

06:26.041 --> 06:27.875
'Be the braggadocios one.'

06:27.959 --> 06:30.834
See, I believe Clyde.

06:30.917 --> 06:32.834
'Had he lived,
would have been the first'

06:32.917 --> 06:34.333
to cross the color line.

06:34.417 --> 06:36.125
Not Jackie Robinson.

06:36.208 --> 06:37.375
So going back.

06:37.458 --> 06:39.125
Do you remember
if Clyde was
carrying

06:39.208 --> 06:40.375
a bat with him that night?

06:40.458 --> 06:42.291
Made sure he had it
in his bag.

06:42.375 --> 06:44.834
I-It was the bat
he hit the home run with.

06:44.917 --> 06:47.125
The home run off
of a Tyler Cage.

06:47.208 --> 06:48.792
- The opposing pitcher.
- Yes, ma'am.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.291
What was your opinion
of him?

06:50.375 --> 06:52.959
The man was lower
than oil dirt.

06:53.041 --> 06:55.959
Ask me who killed Clyde.
My money's on him.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.291
'Because of
the popping off he did'

06:57.375 --> 06:59.291
during the game, race-wise?

06:59.375 --> 07:02.917
What was said during the game
was never an issue.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.500
But off the field.

07:04.583 --> 07:08.709
Well, that was
a different story.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.208
Hey, Mr. Taylor.
Can I have your autograph?

07:16.917 --> 07:18.125
What's your name,
young fella?

07:18.208 --> 07:20.125
Troy.

07:20.208 --> 07:21.375
Okay. Troy.

07:25.625 --> 07:28.166
- Best of luck to you, son.
- Gee, thanks.

07:28.250 --> 07:31.417
Now when I go to the toilet,
I'll have something to use.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.709
Hey, you little bastards!
Get back here!

07:39.667 --> 07:42.125
Come here.

07:42.208 --> 07:44.417
I recognize you.
You're the
batboy.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.667
- So?
- You're the pitcher's son.

07:46.750 --> 07:48.834
Let me have him.

07:48.917 --> 07:52.417
Keep your cotton-pickin'
hands off me, you big
ape.

07:52.500 --> 07:53.917
What are you gonna do?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Hit a kid?

07:57.166 --> 07:58.417
I'd like my name back.

08:09.125 --> 08:10.375
I'm telling my dad.

08:10.458 --> 08:11.709
You're gonna be sorry
you didn't keep

08:11.792 --> 08:14.000
your paws to yourself, boy.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.250
Rotten to the core.
Just like his pa.

08:24.333 --> 08:26.250
You never told
the police this
story?

08:26.333 --> 08:27.917
Never figured it meant much.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.542
Just another jerk kid
being a jerk.

08:31.625 --> 08:33.583
How is it you
became
involved with

08:33.667 --> 08:35.750
what was an
all-black organization?

08:35.834 --> 08:37.542
(Crumbly)
'I knew Clyde since the war.'

08:37.625 --> 08:40.250
'Saw him play ball
with the other servicemen.'

08:40.333 --> 08:41.542
'Then we're home.'

08:41.625 --> 08:44.333
I heard the local negro team
was holding tryouts.

08:44.417 --> 08:45.917
So I rung him up.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.542
Next, Clyde makes
the team.

08:49.834 --> 08:53.625
And tells me
I'm coming along with him.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.250
Troy, we know about
that stunt you pulled

09:02.333 --> 09:04.125
on Clyde after the game.

09:04.208 --> 09:05.667
'Asking for his autograph.'

09:05.750 --> 09:07.000
So?

09:07.083 --> 09:08.417
So we also know
you ran and told

09:08.500 --> 09:10.208
your dad he put
his hands on you.

09:10.291 --> 09:12.291
That don't mean dad went
back
and did something about it.

09:12.375 --> 09:15.083
He's dead ten years.
Let him rest in
peace.

09:15.166 --> 09:16.834
That game ended
his career.

09:16.917 --> 09:19.125
- That gives him motive.
- He had an alibi.

09:19.208 --> 09:20.917
So maybe people
lied for him.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.959
Look, we know the history.

09:23.041 --> 09:25.959
A white pitcher who loses
to a black team in 1945

09:26.041 --> 09:28.291
may have just pitched
himself out of baseball.

09:28.375 --> 09:29.542
Your dad must have
hated Clyde.

09:29.625 --> 09:31.500
Not as much as Moody
he didn't.

09:33.458 --> 09:34.792
Who's Moody?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.291
Moody Brown.

09:37.375 --> 09:40.000
The player Clyde
replaced
on the lineup that day.

09:40.083 --> 09:41.959
How would you know
about that?

09:42.041 --> 09:43.542
When you're seven years old..

09:43.625 --> 09:46.709
...being a
batboy's
like, the, um..

09:46.792 --> 09:48.041
...cat's ass.

09:48.125 --> 09:51.041
Down on the field,
up close and
personal..

09:51.125 --> 09:53.333
...you hear what the
players
are really talking about.

09:53.417 --> 09:54.792
Are you saying
you saw something go down

09:54.875 --> 09:56.208
between Moody
and Clyde?

09:56.291 --> 09:58.208
Had the best
seat
in the house.

10:18.291 --> 10:20.250
Best not be thinkin'
about nothin'..

10:20.333 --> 10:22.291
...but handin' over that ball.

10:23.500 --> 10:24.834
Real nice.

10:28.542 --> 10:31.250
Mister, what's that scar
on your face?

10:33.125 --> 10:34.125
Ask around.

10:34.208 --> 10:35.583
'See what you hear.'

10:36.959 --> 10:38.709
You!

10:38.792 --> 10:40.709
Stop right there!

10:44.333 --> 10:46.792
I just heard I ain't
playing because of
you.

10:46.875 --> 10:50.208
I'm in the lineup?
I didn't know.

10:50.291 --> 10:52.792
Don't worry,
rookie.
Ha-ha-ha. We fine.

10:52.875 --> 10:54.250
We all in this
together,
right?

10:54.333 --> 10:57.208
- 'Cause we only got one day.
- One day?

10:57.291 --> 10:58.875
Tomorrow,
those major
leaguers

10:58.959 --> 11:01.375
go back to being
the boys of
summer.

11:01.458 --> 11:04.041
We go back to being the
boys
who shine their shoes.

11:04.125 --> 11:05.667
I wouldn't
look at it that way.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.208
Look here, what do you
say
you pull a lame

11:10.291 --> 11:13.500
for old Moody
one time, hmm?

11:13.583 --> 11:14.667
You're asking me
to fake an injury.

11:14.750 --> 11:16.875
Not till late
in the game.

11:16.959 --> 11:19.458
Just give me one at
bat.
One moment.

11:19.542 --> 11:21.458
Moody, I want you to play.
I do.

11:23.333 --> 11:24.583
But I couldn't live
with myself.

11:28.792 --> 11:29.834
Alright, then.

11:33.792 --> 11:35.709
Ahh.
Let me go.

11:36.792 --> 11:38.083
'You're breaking my hand.'

11:38.166 --> 11:40.917
Right, I'm
breaking
your hand.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.417
You don't see
to it I get the
bat

11:42.500 --> 11:45.542
I'm gonna break your
head.
Understand?

11:45.625 --> 11:47.208
Hey, what's going on?

11:47.291 --> 11:49.875
We just funnin', Jackie.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.500
Like a pair of old
giggling
pickaninnies over here.

11:58.750 --> 12:02.083
So, Moody made a threat.

12:02.166 --> 12:03.291
We both know players
talk smack

12:03.375 --> 12:04.583
when it comes to playing time.

12:04.667 --> 12:05.792
Yeah.

12:05.875 --> 12:08.291
But when Clyde
hit
that home run..

12:08.375 --> 12:09.667
...all the
negroes
ran out on the
field

12:09.750 --> 12:11.959
like they just won
the World Series.

12:12.041 --> 12:13.458
All except Moody.

12:13.542 --> 12:15.458
(Sutton)
'What was the deal
with the scar?'

12:15.542 --> 12:16.750
You follow up on that?

12:16.834 --> 12:18.041
Negro player told
me
he got it in a

12:18.125 --> 12:20.291
pop bottle fight
with his cousin.

12:20.375 --> 12:22.083
And?

12:22.166 --> 12:24.291
And his cousin
wasn't around no
more.

12:37.417 --> 12:39.250
Excuse me, sir.

12:39.333 --> 12:40.458
'Are you Moody Brown?'

12:45.417 --> 12:47.834
Sitting here in front
of this shop, ain't I?

12:47.917 --> 12:49.166
Who else am I gonna be?

12:50.792 --> 12:52.667
Detectives Jeffries
and Valens, Moody.

12:52.750 --> 12:55.667
We wanna talk to you
about Clyde Taylor.

12:55.750 --> 12:58.208
Why you wanna come here
drudging up that old mess?

12:58.291 --> 12:59.583
We may have a crack
in the case.

12:59.667 --> 13:02.917
From 60 years ago,
what crack you got?

13:03.000 --> 13:04.208
(Will)
'One matter concerns you.'

13:04.291 --> 13:05.542
Has to do with Clyde

13:05.625 --> 13:07.083
cutting into
your playing time.

13:07.166 --> 13:09.375
Aw, that's a stale story.

13:09.458 --> 13:11.250
And one you need
to tell us about.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.667
I played the negro leagues.

13:14.750 --> 13:17.500
I made my hundred
dollars a month.

13:17.583 --> 13:19.709
Beyond that, sorry.

13:19.792 --> 13:21.208
My memory's broke.

13:21.291 --> 13:23.709
A witness heard you tell
Clyde you'd bust his head

13:23.792 --> 13:24.917
if you didn't play.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.417
And you didn't play.

13:27.500 --> 13:30.917
I'll admit I was ready
to square off with Clyde.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.458
I'm the squaring-off type.

13:32.542 --> 13:33.959
And a game against
the major leaguers

13:34.041 --> 13:36.709
didn't come around every day.

13:36.792 --> 13:40.959
Colored player got to feel
what it was like to be
equal..

13:41.041 --> 13:44.208
...if only for three hours
on a Sunday afternoon.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.000
But you didn't get that.

13:47.375 --> 13:50.458
Sir, I wanted a career.

13:51.250 --> 13:52.917
A real one.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.959
'Negro tell you
that wasn't on his mind..'

13:56.041 --> 13:57.208
...he's a liar.

13:59.667 --> 14:00.917
Major league scouts
are out there.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.041
I can tell, they're
just a-licking their chops.

14:03.125 --> 14:06.750
Yeah, they're waiting to spot
me
throw my double wind-up.

14:09.959 --> 14:12.542
What do you think will look
best
on old Satchel there, rookie?

14:12.625 --> 14:14.250
Yankee pinstripes

14:14.333 --> 14:15.709
'or Dodger blue?'

14:15.792 --> 14:18.125
Either one should
look real sharp.

14:18.208 --> 14:19.834
So long as it
comes
with a rocking
chair.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.959
(Satchel)
'Oh, Lordy, Lordy.'

14:23.041 --> 14:25.250
Booker T. Washington
be telling a joke now.

14:27.375 --> 14:28.959
(Crumbs)
'Oh, what about
the color line?'

14:29.041 --> 14:30.917
I mean, you really think
someone's gonna break through?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.625
Satchel, any
opinions
on the subject?

14:32.709 --> 14:34.583
Well, let me see, uh..

14:34.667 --> 14:35.792
Who's the best pitcher
Joe DiMaggio

14:35.875 --> 14:37.834
said he'd ever faced?

14:37.917 --> 14:39.333
And I give a
good interview, too.

14:44.792 --> 14:46.083
Come on, Moody, calm down.

14:46.166 --> 14:47.792
Aw, he's just sore
'cause you're the
future.

14:47.875 --> 14:51.291
Truth be told,
Clyde'll
beat us all to the
majors.

14:51.375 --> 14:53.458
There a problem, gentlemen?

14:53.542 --> 14:54.625
No, sir, Mr. D.

14:55.625 --> 14:57.000
Fine.

14:57.083 --> 14:58.375
May I have a minute, Clyde?

15:03.291 --> 15:06.333
The boys are heaping
some high praise on you.

15:06.417 --> 15:08.083
All this talk
about the majors.

15:09.542 --> 15:12.125
I think it's best
to pay that no mind.

15:12.208 --> 15:13.417
That's good.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.542
Because I own your black ass..

15:15.625 --> 15:17.333
...and don't you forget it.

15:21.959 --> 15:23.667
So Dandridge saw
the writing on the wall

15:23.750 --> 15:25.000
end of the negro leagues

15:25.083 --> 15:27.417
and his millions
going down the drain.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.709
But if he could
hold onto
Clyde..

15:29.792 --> 15:31.458
...maybe his team
somehow survives.

15:33.250 --> 15:36.667
What did Dandridge mean,
saying he owned Clyde?

15:36.750 --> 15:38.333
I don't know.

15:38.417 --> 15:40.375
But back in them days..

15:40.458 --> 15:43.667
...a millionaire black man
didn't become one..

15:43.750 --> 15:45.041
...playing by the rules.

15:56.291 --> 15:58.750
(Rush)
'So the negro leagues
made you a rich man.'

15:58.834 --> 16:03.333
- A millionaire by age 24.
- Sure picked the right job.

16:03.417 --> 16:05.208
I wasn't the only one.

16:05.291 --> 16:07.500
1945 it was one
of the largest

16:07.583 --> 16:10.041
black-dominated businesses
in the United States.

16:10.125 --> 16:13.417
And in '47, Branch
Rickey
signed Jackie Robinson.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.208
So, your league
was on the way
out

16:15.291 --> 16:16.667
'and you were headed
towards bankruptcy.'

16:16.750 --> 16:19.083
Chubby young white fellow
who paid attention

16:19.166 --> 16:21.625
'during black history month.'

16:21.709 --> 16:23.500
Clyde was your
new marquee player.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.417
It'd be bad business
not to tie him up.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.458
- I won't deny that.
- 'The question is, how?'

16:27.542 --> 16:30.041
Players signed month-to-month
contracts in those days.

16:30.125 --> 16:31.417
No way you were
just gonna let him walk

16:31.500 --> 16:32.875
when the majors came calling.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.458
True.

16:34.542 --> 16:36.208
So what did you
have over Clyde?

16:36.291 --> 16:38.291
What's this you "Owned"
him stuff?

16:44.125 --> 16:45.333
You owning my ass.

16:46.333 --> 16:47.458
Is that a joke?

16:47.542 --> 16:49.667
Clyde, you got a gift
that's gonna make

16:49.750 --> 16:51.583
somebody a lotta money.

16:51.667 --> 16:54.417
And since you're mine,
it's gonna be me.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.166
If major leagues open
the game up to coloreds.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.750
Why would you think
you could stop me?

16:58.834 --> 17:00.291
Because you're in love.

17:02.333 --> 17:03.583
And I know with who.

17:04.834 --> 17:06.917
Thought you were
being careful, huh?

17:07.000 --> 17:08.709
Why?

17:08.792 --> 17:09.959
Why would you wanna
do this to me?

17:10.041 --> 17:12.750
So seasoned on the field..

17:12.834 --> 17:15.125
...and so naive off.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.375
Simply put, business.

17:20.291 --> 17:21.792
So maybe I'm not scared
of what you know.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.583
Fine, so long as you're not
scared of a noose

17:24.667 --> 17:25.875
around your neck.

17:27.792 --> 17:30.208
Because you just know
I love to talk.

17:31.583 --> 17:32.917
Suit up.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.750
We'll put this behind us.

17:37.542 --> 17:39.083
I gonna break your neck.

17:42.709 --> 17:44.792
I'm the one
who oughta be sore.

17:47.083 --> 17:49.458
That lily-white skin..

17:49.542 --> 17:52.125
Bet it's even lighter
where the sun don't shine.

17:55.959 --> 17:57.875
Mmm!

17:57.959 --> 18:00.041
What that must be like.

18:10.083 --> 18:11.625
"Lily-white skin?"

18:11.709 --> 18:15.667
Clyde's lady-friend
was as fair as you.

18:15.750 --> 18:18.333
So maybe after the game, Clyde
came looking to break your neck

18:18.417 --> 18:20.166
and you broke
his head first, hmm?

18:20.250 --> 18:23.333
If that was so, I would've
killed him on the choo-choo.

18:23.417 --> 18:26.250
An hour after the game,
I was on a train to New York.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.583
- Can you prove that?
- I'll let you do that.

18:30.583 --> 18:32.083
So who was the white girl?

18:32.166 --> 18:35.041
Some dame on the arm
of this wise guy, uh..

18:35.125 --> 18:36.125
Eddie Mason.

18:37.875 --> 18:39.625
Heard Eddie call her "Legs."

18:39.709 --> 18:43.041
So maybe Eddie knew
about Legs and Clyde..

18:43.125 --> 18:44.667
...gotta hold of that bat.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.333
And hit a home run
of his own.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.166
Leonard.

18:56.125 --> 18:57.458
What are you doing here?

18:57.542 --> 18:59.542
I got locked out.

18:59.625 --> 19:02.208
Your mother told me she
was
going on morning shift.

19:02.291 --> 19:05.000
She did. I think maybe
she's at Ronnie's house.

19:05.083 --> 19:06.208
Who's Ronnie?

19:06.291 --> 19:07.709
Dude that's been staying over.

19:14.166 --> 19:16.083
Thought your sister was seeing
some guy named Benjamin.

19:16.166 --> 19:18.500
Well, that's the problem.
You never know.

19:18.583 --> 19:21.417
Woman's 45
and acts all of
15.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.458
I ran a check on Eddie Mason.

19:23.542 --> 19:24.875
Long sheet.
Bad guy.

19:24.959 --> 19:27.208
- Is he still alive?
- No.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.500
Dead doer.
That never does it for
me.

19:29.583 --> 19:30.750
You should think
about that next time

19:30.834 --> 19:32.250
you go reaching
for a 60-year-old case.

19:32.333 --> 19:34.083
Eddie was charged
with bank embezzlement

19:34.166 --> 19:35.875
a week after
Clyde was murdered.

19:35.959 --> 19:37.500
So, he's out and about
the night of the murder.

19:37.583 --> 19:38.917
We figure out who his lady was?

19:39.000 --> 19:41.333
Seems Eddie had a thing
for showgirls.

19:41.417 --> 19:42.959
Maybe he's not such
a bad guy, after all.

19:43.041 --> 19:45.458
No, Eddie preferred
more legitimate dance.

19:45.542 --> 19:47.542
He was a regular
at Papa Bell's review

19:47.625 --> 19:50.083
home to old-school Philly's
version of the Rockettes.

19:50.166 --> 19:52.333
So maybe "Legs"
was one of them?

19:52.417 --> 19:54.208
Oh, Lil's got Joe Crumbly
looking through old

19:54.291 --> 19:56.542
publicity shots
from Papa Bell's.

19:58.625 --> 20:00.583
- Hey, Leonard.
- What?

20:00.667 --> 20:02.083
'Wanna show you something.'

20:02.166 --> 20:03.500
See that guy back there?

20:05.625 --> 20:07.709
Yeah.
He's old-looking.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.709
He knew Clyde Taylor.

20:11.792 --> 20:13.208
He did?

20:13.291 --> 20:14.792
They were best friends.

20:14.875 --> 20:16.792
[whispering]
Wow.

20:16.875 --> 20:20.333
Me and Clyde were tight
but I guess if he was drawn

20:20.417 --> 20:23.417
to a white girl
he'd keep mum about it.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.792
But you do remember
a white girl hanging around?

20:25.875 --> 20:27.834
At practice,
a time or two.

20:27.917 --> 20:31.417
But none of these gals
ring a bell.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.542
My box of doodads
are good for nothing, huh?

20:34.625 --> 20:36.083
Well, now, this is something.

20:36.166 --> 20:39.333
One of my most-prized
possessions.

20:39.417 --> 20:41.875
Not too hard to tell
which one's me.

20:42.709 --> 20:45.041
- Nice.
- Nice?

20:45.125 --> 20:47.500
Miss doesn't know who
I'm standing alongside.

20:49.959 --> 20:52.041
Alright, that's you..

20:52.125 --> 20:54.834
Clyde, Jackie Robinson.

20:54.917 --> 20:57.542
Josh Gibson,
and Satchel Paige.

20:57.625 --> 21:01.125
Puny me and four
giants of
baseball.

21:01.208 --> 21:03.834
So, what's the deal with
ballplayers and tobacco?

21:03.917 --> 21:07.000
'Every one of you guys,
except Clyde, has a big wad'

21:07.083 --> 21:09.000
of that gunk
in your mouth.

21:09.083 --> 21:11.125
Clyde liked Bazooka Joe.

21:11.208 --> 21:13.333
But most players
did enjoy dipping.

21:14.542 --> 21:16.667
Clyde had a tobacco stain
on his uniform.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.166
Kind of odd
if he didn't chew.

21:19.709 --> 21:21.500
Let's dig out that uniform,
run the stain

21:21.583 --> 21:25.125
and then do a DNA dragnet
on all of our old-timers.

21:25.208 --> 21:28.083
Boss, found three
ladies
still in the area

21:28.166 --> 21:29.333
worked at Papa Bell's.

21:29.417 --> 21:30.834
Their old publicity shots.

21:34.458 --> 21:36.542
Could one of these be her?

21:36.625 --> 21:37.709
Jeepers.

21:37.792 --> 21:40.709
Surprised I remember so well.

21:40.792 --> 21:42.375
That's "Legs".

21:42.458 --> 21:46.250
Name's Esther Davis.
Lives on the Main
Line.

21:46.333 --> 21:47.792
Say.
Hey, young fella.

21:49.083 --> 21:50.250
Hey.

22:00.417 --> 22:02.625
Ginger Rogers.

22:02.709 --> 22:04.333
That's who I wanted to be.

22:04.417 --> 22:07.041
I was 19,
new in town.

22:07.125 --> 22:08.875
Papa Bell's
was the place to be.

22:08.959 --> 22:10.542
And that's where
you met Eddie Mason?

22:10.625 --> 22:13.667
After the show, he asked me
to dine at his table.

22:14.667 --> 22:15.917
How did you meet Clyde?

22:16.000 --> 22:17.250
Eddie and his cronies
wanted to swing

22:17.333 --> 22:20.083
by the ball field,
watch some practice.

22:20.166 --> 22:23.750
While they were
yackety-yakking,
I went to find some shade.

22:23.834 --> 22:27.458
- And there he was?
- By a drinking fountain.

22:27.542 --> 22:30.792
This gorgeous man
trying to cool off.

22:30.875 --> 22:33.542
We hardly said boo
to one another but..

22:33.625 --> 22:35.709
...must have stood there
a good five minutes.

22:37.250 --> 22:39.333
It was storybook.
It really was.

22:39.417 --> 22:41.375
But now you had
two big
problems.

22:41.458 --> 22:44.083
- Yes.
- One, what to do about Eddie.

22:44.166 --> 22:48.792
And, two, falling in love
when it was still 1945.

22:48.875 --> 22:51.500
Did Eddie know
about you and Clyde?

22:51.583 --> 22:54.333
Even if he did,
he didn't kill him.

22:54.417 --> 22:58.166
Eddie was in Miami Beach
that weekend, scheming away.

22:58.250 --> 23:00.542
So, him being gone,
you must have..

23:00.625 --> 23:02.000
...been with Clyde
that last day?

23:02.083 --> 23:04.875
I went to the game,
and met him afterwards.

23:04.959 --> 23:07.792
At the water fountain...
like always.

23:10.375 --> 23:11.959
(male #2)
'How does it feel?'

23:12.041 --> 23:13.125
Feels like every other game

23:13.208 --> 23:14.500
when you name
is Satchel Paige.

23:20.291 --> 23:21.583
Clyde, what is
it?
What's wrong?

23:21.667 --> 23:24.166
- Dandridge knows about us.
- Oh, no.

23:24.250 --> 23:27.333
Says I have to play
for him forever, always.

23:27.417 --> 23:29.000
Or he's gonna
tell about us.

23:29.083 --> 23:31.333
But if you do play for him,
he'll keep his mouth shut?

23:31.417 --> 23:33.000
But then I'd have
to give up any chance

23:33.083 --> 23:34.625
of ever playing
in the majors.

23:34.709 --> 23:36.875
- So?
- So?

23:36.959 --> 23:38.417
Why is that so important?

23:38.500 --> 23:39.834
Because..

23:39.917 --> 23:41.333
...if a colored ballplayer
can show he's as good as

23:41.417 --> 23:44.917
the white players in the most
American game there is

23:45.000 --> 23:46.667
maybe a boy with skin like
mine
won't be up at night

23:46.750 --> 23:49.667
praying he could scratch the
color away so he can be normal.

23:49.750 --> 23:51.166
Honey, the world
you're dreaming
of

23:51.250 --> 23:53.333
is a long, long
way off from
now.

23:53.417 --> 23:56.000
Gotta start somewhere.

23:56.083 --> 23:58.959
Clyde, don't try
to be a pioneer.

23:59.041 --> 24:01.208
It's best to just
keep your head down.

24:01.291 --> 24:03.959
Maybe the answer is
for you to lift your head up.

24:05.667 --> 24:08.250
Hey, man of the hour,
the world is waiting for
you.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.083
[sobbing]
Oh, Clyde.

24:14.542 --> 24:17.375
Dad, look,
there he
is.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.625
Go out front, baby.

24:27.875 --> 24:29.709
So, Troy and his
father were still there

24:29.792 --> 24:30.917
during the press conference?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.208
- Yes.
- 'Did they say anything
else?'

24:33.291 --> 24:35.041
Make any threat on Clyde?

24:35.125 --> 24:38.083
No.
The father never spoke.

24:38.166 --> 24:40.917
Just stood there
so menacingly.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.583
I think that was
more frightening

24:42.667 --> 24:44.000
than had he said something.

24:56.166 --> 24:58.625
If you weren't such a looker..

24:58.709 --> 25:00.542
...I'd be losing my patience
right about now.

25:00.625 --> 25:01.750
If you didn't lie
about your dad

25:01.834 --> 25:03.083
we wouldn't need to be here.

25:03.166 --> 25:05.417
I never lied.
What'd you do with the
Spaniard?

25:05.500 --> 25:07.792
(Will)
'Detective Jeffries, Troy'

25:07.875 --> 25:09.959
heard some flattering
things about you.

25:10.041 --> 25:12.750
The way I see it, you've
been
a good boy and a bad boy.

25:12.834 --> 25:14.917
Good because you told me about
Clyde teaching you civility

25:15.000 --> 25:17.041
'and how your bratty butt
ran off to tell daddy.'

25:17.125 --> 25:19.250
But bad because
you left out the part

25:19.333 --> 25:21.875
where you and pops
doubled back for Clyde.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.041
Okay, we doubled back.

25:29.250 --> 25:30.417
Keep going.

25:31.875 --> 25:33.917
When I told him
about the autograph deal..

25:34.000 --> 25:35.208
...that was the last straw.

25:35.291 --> 25:36.959
He said he wouldn't
let that stand.

25:47.917 --> 25:49.083
Nice bat.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.500
Not real fair
sneaking up on a man.

25:53.583 --> 25:55.125
My son told me
what you did.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.291
I'm here to tell you
I'm embarrassed.

26:05.834 --> 26:08.834
- He's a kid.
- I'm talking about me.

26:08.917 --> 26:12.041
The names I used on you
during the game.

26:12.125 --> 26:13.291
Oh.

26:15.917 --> 26:19.083
Your first at-bat,
I could tell you were special.

26:19.166 --> 26:20.625
Second at-bat,
I could tell

26:20.709 --> 26:23.458
you were the best hitter
I've ever faced.

26:23.542 --> 26:27.792
After that, I throw you the
hardest ball I've ever thrown.

26:27.875 --> 26:30.083
And you cleaned my clock.

26:30.166 --> 26:32.291
It don't feel good..

26:32.375 --> 26:33.542
...but now I know.

26:44.625 --> 26:45.959
Thank you.

26:46.041 --> 26:47.917
Daddy, come on.
Can we go yet?

26:49.250 --> 26:50.375
Troy, come here.

26:53.542 --> 26:56.166
I want you to say you're sorry
to Mr. Taylor.

26:56.250 --> 26:57.375
[spitting]
No.

26:57.458 --> 26:59.250
Get that tobacco
out of your mouth!

27:01.333 --> 27:03.667
But, Daddy, you saw

27:03.750 --> 27:06.500
the jig had his mitts
on that white lady.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.834
Don't judge a book
by its cover!

27:08.917 --> 27:10.417
'You understand?'

27:12.041 --> 27:14.792
So I said sorry.
Had to.

27:14.875 --> 27:17.041
That was real tobacco
in your mouth?

27:17.125 --> 27:19.208
Used to do whatever
my dad did.

27:19.291 --> 27:22.041
That might explain
the stain on Clyde's
jersey.

27:22.125 --> 27:24.542
DNA won't help if
the tobacco was Troy's.

27:24.625 --> 27:26.667
Now can we call
this meeting, please?

27:26.750 --> 27:29.041
Yeah. Okay, Troy.

27:29.125 --> 27:30.375
At least your dad
taught you a lesson.

27:30.458 --> 27:33.750
Not really. I'm still
not real big on spooks.

27:33.834 --> 27:35.375
(Sutton)
'So "Don't judge a book
by its cover"'

27:35.458 --> 27:36.750
'didn't even dent
your knucklehead?'

27:36.834 --> 27:38.041
That part was
about the girl.

27:38.125 --> 27:40.000
So, that got
through just fine.

27:40.083 --> 27:41.375
How was that about the girl?

27:41.458 --> 27:43.208
Dad recognized the lady.

27:43.291 --> 27:45.208
She was from the same town
down south where he grew up.

27:45.291 --> 27:46.458
What are you
getting at, Troy?

27:46.542 --> 27:50.500
The white lady.
She wasn't really
white.

27:50.583 --> 27:51.625
She was black.

28:01.792 --> 28:03.542
Does your husband
know, Esther?

28:03.625 --> 28:04.709
Know what?

28:04.792 --> 28:06.250
You're black.

28:11.125 --> 28:13.041
No, he doesn't.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.583
- But Clyde did.
- 'Yes.'

28:14.667 --> 28:17.917
- He was the only one.
- Is that why he had to die?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.875
What do you mean?

28:19.959 --> 28:22.166
Your secret was
so important to you.

28:22.250 --> 28:24.250
You have a whole
lifetime as a white woman

28:24.333 --> 28:26.333
that tells just
how important.

28:31.709 --> 28:35.125
I came here from
Macon, Georgia.

28:35.208 --> 28:36.959
Had two sisters.
Dorothy and Ruby.

28:37.041 --> 28:38.375
We were dirt poor.

28:38.458 --> 28:39.709
How'd you end up here?

28:39.792 --> 28:42.458
We were living in Squalor.

28:42.542 --> 28:45.250
Auntie said I had
the lightest skin.

28:45.333 --> 28:47.458
I could make a real living
like a white person.

28:47.542 --> 28:50.709
And then, once here,
you were able to pass

28:50.792 --> 28:52.250
and got on at Papa Bell's.

28:52.333 --> 28:54.500
I had some dreams of my own.

28:54.583 --> 28:57.000
But maybe Clyde asked you
to live colored..

28:57.083 --> 28:59.125
...was going to out you.

28:59.208 --> 29:01.792
'You did ask him
to keep his head down.'

29:01.875 --> 29:03.959
And Clyde thought
the answer was
for..

29:04.041 --> 29:05.333
...you to lift
your head up.

29:05.417 --> 29:06.959
'But you wanted
your dreams, so you..'

29:07.041 --> 29:08.625
..stopped him from living his.

29:08.709 --> 29:12.834
No, but I could see
the only way for us..

29:12.917 --> 29:16.625
...to both get what we wanted
was to go our separate ways.

29:16.709 --> 29:19.083
That's not what
you said before.

29:19.166 --> 29:21.709
You wanted Clyde to
forget about the
majors.

29:21.792 --> 29:24.250
But then someone
changed my mind.

29:26.417 --> 29:27.625
(Crumbs)
'Esther.'

29:27.709 --> 29:28.667
Who's there?

29:28.750 --> 29:30.625
It's, uh, it's me.
Crumbs.

29:32.542 --> 29:34.500
Were you crying?

29:34.583 --> 29:36.333
I'm just
scared
for Clyde.

29:36.417 --> 29:37.625
He's butting
heads
with Dandridge

29:37.709 --> 29:39.166
and he might get hurt.

29:39.250 --> 29:40.667
Yeah.

29:40.750 --> 29:42.417
Yeah, I'm scared, too.

29:42.500 --> 29:44.291
But, uh..

29:44.375 --> 29:47.583
But because, you know, I think
Clyde might hurt himself.

29:47.667 --> 29:49.792
What do you mean?

29:49.875 --> 29:52.917
Well, he-he told me
about Dandridge.

29:53.000 --> 29:57.542
And about how, how the majors
are no longer even a dream.

29:57.625 --> 30:00.542
- Clyde said that?
- Yeah, just now.

30:00.625 --> 30:02.000
Because he's chosen you.

30:03.208 --> 30:05.083
- Oh.
- Yeah.

30:05.166 --> 30:07.166
You seem pretty
happy about it.

30:07.250 --> 30:08.875
Yes.

30:08.959 --> 30:11.458
- I should go.
- Esther, wait.

30:11.542 --> 30:13.834
- Ow.
- Sorry.

30:13.917 --> 30:15.083
It's just..

30:16.542 --> 30:18.375
You know, I never
seen him so down.

30:18.458 --> 30:19.959
I sure wish
you'd think about that.

30:20.041 --> 30:21.709
Think about it?

30:21.792 --> 30:23.208
Look, just scram, okay.

30:23.291 --> 30:24.625
- What?
- Just go.

30:24.709 --> 30:26.000
Take your good
foot outta here.

30:26.083 --> 30:28.750
Go to some dance hall
in New York or somewhere.

30:28.834 --> 30:30.208
That's for you.

30:30.291 --> 30:32.458
- Give Clyde his chance.
- No.

30:32.542 --> 30:34.792
It's complicated,
what's going on between
us.

30:34.875 --> 30:36.417
It's not something
you'd understand.

30:36.500 --> 30:37.959
- You think I'm stupid?
- No.

30:38.041 --> 30:40.250
Sweetheart, I know
a hell of a lot more

30:40.333 --> 30:43.166
about one thing than
anybody you could round up.

30:43.250 --> 30:44.500
I know that if
you leave Clyde alone

30:44.583 --> 30:46.625
Dandridge won't have
anything to hold over him.

30:46.709 --> 30:49.417
He'll be free to swap
places with Babe Ruth

30:49.500 --> 30:51.750
and be the best player alive.

30:51.834 --> 30:53.875
That's a fact.

30:55.625 --> 30:57.291
But only if you leave.

30:57.375 --> 30:59.750
Then why doesn't
Clyde tell me
this?

30:59.834 --> 31:01.667
Come on, he's a prince.

31:02.583 --> 31:04.083
Never tell you to your face.

31:05.125 --> 31:06.625
Please.

31:06.709 --> 31:09.000
I'm beggin' you.
Leave us alone.

31:18.208 --> 31:20.792
So, Crumbs knew all
about the two of you?

31:23.458 --> 31:25.542
Clyde made sure
of that early
on.

31:25.625 --> 31:27.917
Told me I had to pass
muster with the greatest

31:28.000 --> 31:30.875
clubhouse manager
in baseball or I was out.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.041
Okey-dokey. Next.

31:42.125 --> 31:44.083
'Who was the first
African-American'

31:44.166 --> 31:46.291
'to play in the major leagues?'

31:46.375 --> 31:47.834
(Leonard)
'Jackie Robinson.'

31:47.917 --> 31:50.291
Wrong.
Fleet Walker.

31:50.375 --> 31:52.625
He played back in 1884.

31:54.667 --> 31:56.000
(Will)
'DNA came in, Joe.'

31:56.083 --> 31:57.583
We thought you
might be wondering.

31:59.625 --> 32:01.333
You're sweating.

32:04.166 --> 32:06.625
Crumbs, tell another one
about Clyde.

32:08.166 --> 32:10.667
Sorry, kiddo, don't
know
if I have another.

32:10.750 --> 32:14.166
I heard Clyde had a special
bat he liked to use.

32:14.250 --> 32:15.625
I used to hold it for him.

32:15.709 --> 32:18.500
No, he use it on
the day he was killed?

32:18.583 --> 32:21.375
The one he hit
the home run
with.

32:21.458 --> 32:23.542
So, tell us about
that one, Crumbs.

32:24.792 --> 32:26.041
'What do you say, huh?'

32:30.291 --> 32:33.834
One day,
Clyde handed me a bat..

32:33.917 --> 32:36.834
'...and told me to always
have it on hand.'

32:36.917 --> 32:40.875
Said he only used this bat
when he really needed it.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.959
Like, when terrible pressure

32:43.041 --> 32:44.500
comes creeping up your neck.

32:44.583 --> 32:47.083
What made
that bat so special?

32:48.667 --> 32:51.917
Said because he hit
more grounders with it

32:52.000 --> 32:54.083
than any other bat
he ever used.

32:54.166 --> 32:56.667
Grounders?
But those are lame.

32:56.750 --> 33:01.458
Even so, his last time up.
That's the bat he wanted to
use.

33:01.542 --> 33:04.375
This old pressure was...
creeping up, huh?

33:04.458 --> 33:07.208
Any man would've been
shaking in his shoes.

33:08.291 --> 33:10.291
And so you gave him the bat.

33:11.667 --> 33:14.083
And he told me he was
gonna hit a grounder..

33:14.166 --> 33:15.625
...just for me.

33:15.709 --> 33:18.875
So there he was, whoo..

33:18.959 --> 33:22.750
'...looking at the fastest
fastball you ever did see.'

33:25.000 --> 33:26.250
And crack.

33:28.625 --> 33:32.083
It was the home
run
of home runs.

33:32.166 --> 33:34.417
And that grounder
he was talking about?

33:34.500 --> 33:36.125
That's what I asked.

33:36.208 --> 33:39.959
He said,
"You'll learn,
Crumbs.

33:40.041 --> 33:42.375
"Someday, you'll learn."

33:42.458 --> 33:44.834
(Valens)
'So, if a homer
and a grounder'

33:44.917 --> 33:47.083
mean the same thing to you..

33:47.166 --> 33:48.834
...your nerves
won't get to you.

33:50.500 --> 33:52.333
I sure would like
to see that bat.

33:58.750 --> 34:01.250
Won't be needing
this no more.

34:17.208 --> 34:18.458
Wow.

34:18.542 --> 34:20.500
Missing since the
night
Clyde died.

34:20.583 --> 34:22.166
Yeah, we've been
looking for that.

34:22.250 --> 34:23.125
Can I hold it?

34:23.208 --> 34:25.417
I better give it
to your uncle.

34:25.500 --> 34:27.583
Come on, Leonard.
Let's take a look at
this.

34:29.834 --> 34:33.458
Hey...thank Joe
for the nice
time.

34:34.750 --> 34:35.667
Thanks, Crumbs.

34:35.750 --> 34:37.667
When you get older, Leonard..

34:37.750 --> 34:39.750
...do me one thing,
would you?

34:41.375 --> 34:44.667
Don't remember
what that bat did to Clyde.

34:46.125 --> 34:49.458
Remember what Clyde
did with that bat.

34:54.834 --> 34:56.041
Want to sit?

35:13.250 --> 35:16.542
There he is!

35:16.625 --> 35:19.208
- Crumbs.
- Mr. Major Leagues.

35:19.291 --> 35:20.667
Here we come.

35:21.917 --> 35:24.333
You can forget
about that one.

35:24.417 --> 35:26.542
Never gonna happen
with Esther around.

35:26.625 --> 35:29.709
Oh, yeah, um,
that's the thing.

35:29.792 --> 35:30.917
I-I fixed it.

35:32.083 --> 35:33.291
What do you,
what do you mean?

35:33.375 --> 35:34.792
Esther.

35:34.875 --> 35:37.041
Yeah, she's, uh,
she's gonna go away.

35:37.125 --> 35:38.041
What?

35:38.125 --> 35:39.125
I know it's going
to hurt up front.

35:39.208 --> 35:41.542
But, yeah,
it's for the better.

35:41.625 --> 35:43.875
- Got her packing.
- Packing?

35:45.667 --> 35:47.750
- Who do you think you are?
- What?

35:47.834 --> 35:50.250
Tellin' Esther to
break it off with
me?

35:50.333 --> 35:51.417
I can't believe
you
did this to me.

35:51.500 --> 35:54.417
Whoa, I was trying
to help you.

35:54.500 --> 35:55.500
You'll see.

36:00.750 --> 36:03.417
Clyde, your bat.

36:03.500 --> 36:05.417
Keep it.
Forever.

36:05.500 --> 36:08.333
But this bat's gonna be in
the Hall of Fame one day.

36:08.417 --> 36:10.291
It's only a game.

36:10.375 --> 36:11.750
Hit a ball and run
around the bags.

36:11.834 --> 36:14.000
It's fun.
But for kids.

36:14.083 --> 36:15.917
A man has a life to live.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.000
Stupid broad.

36:21.041 --> 36:22.291
What did you say?

36:23.875 --> 36:25.917
That's what always
stops the great ones.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.291
Don't let her stop you.

36:27.375 --> 36:29.458
- She's in my soul, Crumbs.
- 'Oh, cripes!'

36:29.542 --> 36:32.583
A floozy with
a great pair a gams?

36:32.667 --> 36:33.750
Big deal.

36:36.625 --> 36:38.125
You been my friend, Crumbs.

36:39.959 --> 36:42.417
I'll always remember that.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.959
But you let this game
make your life so
small.

36:46.917 --> 36:49.417
- And now I can't even see
you.
- Oh, yeah.

36:49.500 --> 36:53.500
Hey, bub, you got any idea
what you're throwing away, huh?

36:53.583 --> 36:56.208
What some men would do
to be in your shoes..

36:56.291 --> 36:57.792
...to get just one swing?

36:59.375 --> 37:01.500
Hey!
Are you listening?

37:01.583 --> 37:03.291
Hey, slow up.

37:03.375 --> 37:05.291
- Clyde, stop.
- No.

37:05.375 --> 37:06.625
Okay, okay.

37:06.709 --> 37:08.792
Say, "Idiot."

37:08.875 --> 37:10.583
Say something.

37:10.667 --> 37:13.667
Clyde, what about
our future, huh?

37:13.750 --> 37:15.291
My future!

37:15.375 --> 37:16.625
Stop the walking.

37:16.709 --> 37:17.875
You're not
going anywhere.

37:17.959 --> 37:19.458
I will stop you.
I will.

37:19.542 --> 37:20.709
Just stop.

37:21.709 --> 37:22.917
Clyde!

37:25.792 --> 37:27.291
Oh, no.

37:27.375 --> 37:28.709
'Oh, no, no.'

37:31.750 --> 37:34.375
No, Clyde.
Don't go.

37:38.750 --> 37:42.667
[sobbing]
Please don't go.
Please.

37:42.750 --> 37:44.041
Please.
