WEBVTT

06:59.000 --> 07:00.458
Good morning, sir.

09:24.083 --> 09:26.708
Don't ask me anything.
Don't ask me nothing.

09:27.625 --> 09:31.583
Boy, I don't want to hear anything.

09:35.166 --> 09:38.333
Mom, I left Thandeka with Minata.

09:38.416 --> 09:42.166
Okay, my boy. I'll be late tonight.

09:42.250 --> 09:44.333
Don't forget to pick her up.

09:44.416 --> 09:46.333
Don't worry. Why do you worry so much?

09:50.458 --> 09:52.833
Bring her home by six, period.

09:55.583 --> 09:57.458
Hey, dawg, let's try there.

09:57.541 --> 09:59.625
-It's a waste of time, man.
-Let's go.

10:01.500 --> 10:04.541
Oh, this child. I'm telling you, my child.

10:05.041 --> 10:06.833
-Good morning, sir.
-Yes, my boy.

10:06.916 --> 10:09.458
I'm looking for a job.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.375
There is nothing here.

10:14.666 --> 10:16.125
Look at those boxes over there.

10:17.875 --> 10:19.375
You know what? I'm sorry.

10:21.166 --> 10:23.500
I can even mop, and I'm pretty good.

10:26.875 --> 10:28.583
I'm asking for three hours only.

10:28.666 --> 10:31.375
The job you're asking about,
she will do it.

10:31.458 --> 10:34.750
But, Dad, it's only three hours.

10:35.375 --> 10:36.791
Besides, I need a break.

10:37.583 --> 10:39.208
You know what? That's nonsense.

10:54.875 --> 10:56.333
Check this out, gents.

10:56.416 --> 10:58.833
This is the best local group.

10:58.916 --> 11:01.541
This group has over
100,000 views on YouTube.

11:01.625 --> 11:03.958
Leave us alone
with your stupid 100,000 views group.

11:04.041 --> 11:06.708
Now get lost.
We don't want to buy your shit.

11:06.791 --> 11:10.041
This guy's the new shit. Name is Cecil.
Remember that. Now, piss off!

11:10.666 --> 11:13.916
Do you see why
we have to release your music?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.500
Look at this guy selling bootlegs.
What's up with you?

11:19.250 --> 11:22.333
What do you mean,
''Stop rushing the process"?

11:22.416 --> 11:26.125
When you say "rush the process,"
what do you mean?

11:26.708 --> 11:28.791
Have you forgotten you're in Johannesburg?

11:28.875 --> 11:30.916
You have to hustle.
Otherwise, you'll starve.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.041
Is that what you want?

11:35.125 --> 11:37.333
No, man.
You still texting this whore of yours.

11:37.416 --> 11:38.791
-Give it back.
-I'm talking.

11:38.875 --> 11:42.166
-Give it back.
-I'm talking.

13:44.375 --> 13:47.333
Hush now, my sister

13:48.000 --> 13:51.041
It's going to be fine, my sister

13:51.958 --> 13:55.416
We're way closer now, my sister

13:55.958 --> 13:59.208
Hush now, my sister

13:59.291 --> 14:01.208
Yeah, man.

14:01.750 --> 14:02.791
My boy.

14:05.125 --> 14:06.125
That's the one.

14:10.416 --> 14:13.666
I'll tell you one thing, man,
this is your best song ever. Trust me.

14:13.750 --> 14:17.666
This is very hot. It reminds me
of Mashayabhuqe KaMamba.

14:17.750 --> 14:19.208
Or new age Ringo.

14:21.416 --> 14:23.500
Do you know where I see myself?

14:23.583 --> 14:26.666
With the likes of Big Zulu,

14:26.750 --> 14:28.250
Sjava,

14:28.333 --> 14:30.000
Zikode,

14:30.083 --> 14:31.791
Mnqobi Yazo.

14:31.875 --> 14:33.541
This will make us money though.

14:33.625 --> 14:35.208
I'm posting it now. We need money.

14:43.125 --> 14:45.375
My boy, this country needs money.
I'm telling you.

14:45.458 --> 14:49.708
Look at me right now. I'm stressed.
I can't look after my mom and my sister.

14:54.375 --> 14:57.083
This is why you'll end up
selling crystal meth.

14:57.166 --> 14:58.583
What else can I do?

14:59.250 --> 15:01.083
I'll be supplying the whole world.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.791
We will be rich.
We'll be making money. You'll see.

15:04.541 --> 15:06.041
Weed, boy.

15:06.125 --> 15:07.541
See, when you sell weed…

15:14.166 --> 15:16.458
And that's bullshit.
I just want real energy.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.041
Go on and sing.

15:19.916 --> 15:23.041
Hush now, my sister

15:23.125 --> 15:27.208
It's going to be fine, my sister

17:38.041 --> 17:39.083
What's your problem?

18:09.833 --> 18:12.583
-What are you saying?
-It's not a strip club, Thando.

18:12.666 --> 18:15.458
But look at your girl, all naked.
What do you want me to do?

18:16.083 --> 18:17.375
I'm warning you.

18:17.458 --> 18:20.833
I'm just kidding, man.

18:35.458 --> 18:36.291
Here.

19:39.916 --> 19:42.708
There's no reason to worry about the box.

19:42.791 --> 19:44.583
Everyone kept their word.

19:47.125 --> 19:52.875
True, but the higher-ups
had to pull a few more favors than usual.

19:53.708 --> 19:55.708
You know your package is huge.

20:01.666 --> 20:05.583
Or they shut down
the construction of the school.

20:07.666 --> 20:09.291
You know which one.

20:17.208 --> 20:20.083
What can I say? It's a big package.

20:31.125 --> 20:34.041
Jeez. What's making you smile like this?

20:34.708 --> 20:36.583
It's nothing.

20:36.666 --> 20:37.958
-Relax.
-What is it?

20:38.041 --> 20:39.458
Is it Given?

20:40.375 --> 20:41.958
No.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.333
Dad, please calm down.

22:17.125 --> 22:18.333
How much did we make?

22:26.000 --> 22:27.833
It's going to be fine, Dad. Don't worry.

22:29.041 --> 22:31.833
You know what? We should go home.

22:31.916 --> 22:34.250
I'll fix you that pasta dish
Mom used to make.

22:35.125 --> 22:39.250
Now you're talking.
With that tasty cream sauce?

22:40.875 --> 22:42.833
Let's get the keys and leave, my girl.

22:45.291 --> 22:47.916
It's going to work out.
Everything works out.

22:49.875 --> 22:51.000
There.

22:51.083 --> 22:55.666
This right here is the perfect place.

22:55.750 --> 22:58.583
Dad, we have our own place.

22:58.666 --> 23:00.166
And we're barely making rent.

23:00.250 --> 23:02.708
The problem is that you have no vision.

23:02.791 --> 23:06.750
This place will help this entire block.

23:06.833 --> 23:10.208
Since when did you start
thinking about expanding? Dad.

23:14.750 --> 23:17.416
This has been my dream for you.

23:18.875 --> 23:20.291
It's going to become a reality.

23:59.375 --> 24:02.625
Palesa, what did I say to you
about mixing with these people?

24:02.708 --> 24:05.541
Please don't start with that.
These people are not the same.

24:06.708 --> 24:08.750
Look at how our stores are suffering.

24:08.833 --> 24:13.833
Because of these people
who are selling stolen goods for cheap.

24:15.333 --> 24:19.166
These people are worse
than what white people did to us.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.208
That's what they said about you.

27:20.833 --> 27:22.750
This is what I'm talking about.

27:23.791 --> 27:27.041
This is how it should be.
The men need to be strong.

28:56.458 --> 28:57.875
Hey there, girl.

28:59.083 --> 29:01.500
Why are you avoiding me?

29:01.583 --> 29:03.166
I'm not avoiding you, Given.

29:03.250 --> 29:04.916
Yes, you are.

29:05.000 --> 29:08.583
Look, I can take care of you
and your family.

29:09.208 --> 29:10.208
I'm serious.

29:10.791 --> 29:15.208
I can make your problems disappear,
and all the stress you might have.

29:15.291 --> 29:18.375
You know I don't want
to get married, right? To anyone.

29:22.541 --> 29:24.875
-What's the matter, Dad?
-Please get out.

29:24.958 --> 29:26.166
I need to speak to Given.

29:26.750 --> 29:28.625
-No, what's the matter?
-Get out!

29:29.333 --> 29:30.416
Get out!

31:25.750 --> 31:26.875
Hello, Mother.

31:29.083 --> 31:31.625
Do you see it? I made it for you.

31:32.291 --> 31:33.208
Oh, wow.

31:38.333 --> 31:40.291
-Is it an elephant?
-An elephant?

31:40.958 --> 31:43.291
Where have you seen an elephant like that?

31:43.375 --> 31:45.625
Stop being an idiot.

31:46.750 --> 31:49.083
Tell me.

31:49.708 --> 31:54.500
I hear rumors all over this place

31:56.250 --> 32:00.666
that my son, who I raised with respect

32:01.666 --> 32:06.041
and dignity, is killing people.

32:06.125 --> 32:08.750
No, Mother, don't worry about rumors.

32:10.875 --> 32:13.000
You must always remember that

32:13.083 --> 32:15.666
there's no man
who is an island in this world.

32:15.750 --> 32:18.250
Yes, I hear you, Mother.

32:18.333 --> 32:21.500
You've always been a good boy

32:22.791 --> 32:24.666
who has respect.

32:24.750 --> 32:27.791
Now I'm begging you, my son.

32:28.375 --> 32:30.000
Please be smart.

32:32.958 --> 32:35.000
I will keep it right here.

32:35.625 --> 32:36.583
See?

32:37.750 --> 32:39.458
It's going to keep me safe.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
It's okay.

32:49.958 --> 32:53.375
Tell me, are you going to
come and see me tomorrow?

32:57.458 --> 32:59.375
I'll come and see you.

33:50.666 --> 33:52.208
The duck is delicious.

34:05.458 --> 34:06.416
…still battling?

34:10.916 --> 34:15.375
I hope it's not like the last two weeks.

35:23.750 --> 35:26.833
Hey, the truck is ready.

35:27.541 --> 35:28.833
Ball's in your court now.

36:29.958 --> 36:34.041
Hey, Wiseman. It's Given.

36:35.541 --> 36:36.791
Tell me,

36:36.875 --> 36:40.791
how long has Palesa
been seeing that fool Adze?

36:40.875 --> 36:42.250
What are you saying?

36:42.333 --> 36:45.625
I saw her together with that idiot.

36:46.583 --> 36:50.875
You know what?
To hell with the both of them.

36:51.666 --> 36:53.375
All right, Wiseman.

38:20.791 --> 38:22.958
Follow me to my office.

38:34.166 --> 38:37.250
Your friend has gotten himself
a nice job here in my club.

38:37.333 --> 38:38.916
Thank you, Bra Sol.

38:40.708 --> 38:42.666
I almost didn't.

38:49.125 --> 38:50.875
So, what are you going to do for me?

38:50.958 --> 38:53.958
Anything you want me to do,
Bra Sol, I will do it.

38:56.333 --> 38:58.666
I only work with people I can trust.

39:00.750 --> 39:02.541
You can trust me.

39:02.625 --> 39:05.958
Just give me a chance,
and let me show you that you can trust me.

39:08.541 --> 39:11.708
That white girl you came with…

39:12.416 --> 39:13.500
She's really sexy.

39:15.458 --> 39:16.791
She is…

39:19.000 --> 39:20.583
She's my friend's girlfriend.

39:23.500 --> 39:28.041
I need girls like her in my club.
That are sexy.

39:33.250 --> 39:36.500
Do you think you'll be able
to help me with that?

39:36.583 --> 39:39.083
As you know, one hand washes the other.

39:40.166 --> 39:42.666
I don't know about that, Bra Sol.

39:44.958 --> 39:48.541
White people took everything from you.

39:49.625 --> 39:52.541
They took your father from you.
Do you remember?

39:58.083 --> 40:00.083
You'll make yourself some money.

40:07.208 --> 40:08.541
I won't disappoint you.

40:08.625 --> 40:10.458
I know you won't let me down.

40:12.458 --> 40:15.833
Go and have fun in the club.

40:24.666 --> 40:25.833
So long, Bra Sol.

42:13.458 --> 42:14.750
Hello, neighbors.

42:15.500 --> 42:17.416
I just spoke to the landlord.

42:17.500 --> 42:20.041
He said he has rented out
that place already.

42:20.125 --> 42:22.125
He gave it to that Nigerian, Adze.

42:22.208 --> 42:25.583
He says he gave him an offer
he couldn't refuse.

42:25.666 --> 42:29.041
-The guy who stays by your apartment?
-That is my shop, man.

42:29.125 --> 42:34.291
It doesn't belong to anybody else.
Listen, I'm sure he used drug money.

42:34.375 --> 42:35.875
Right now, he's busy unpacking.

42:35.958 --> 42:40.291
This is ridiculous. We're being undermined
in our own neighborhood.

42:40.375 --> 42:43.125
Gents, these foreigners
are not here to play.

42:43.208 --> 42:45.708
They are here to make us starve.

42:45.791 --> 42:49.666
They are bringing in expired food,
and they're selling it at half price.

42:49.750 --> 42:51.458
They're making our people sick.

42:51.541 --> 42:54.083
Next thing,
they'll be selling drugs to our kids.

42:54.916 --> 42:58.416
And then they'll sell them off
as prostitutes.

42:58.500 --> 43:01.125
Listen up, gents.

43:01.208 --> 43:05.625
I'm saying, Nigerians and Zimbabweans
are all the same.

43:05.708 --> 43:06.916
They're full of shit.

43:07.000 --> 43:11.375
They are all the same.
That's why we need to show them who's who.

43:11.458 --> 43:12.375
Do you get me?

43:12.458 --> 43:17.333
These people must go back
to wherever they came from.

43:22.041 --> 43:23.666
They must go back!

43:26.791 --> 43:29.583
They must go!

43:46.208 --> 43:48.791
This is Bra Sol's stuff, man.

45:11.791 --> 45:12.916
We can go now.

52:01.208 --> 52:04.833
-Where's your Uber, man?
-Relax, it's coming.

52:18.583 --> 52:21.583
-Couldn't you call us an Uber?
-Yes, Uber.

52:23.375 --> 52:24.416
Let's go.

52:37.375 --> 52:39.375
I got this stuff from Bra Sol.

52:39.458 --> 52:41.416
I'm going to sell this car to him.

54:30.666 --> 54:32.125
Step on it, bro!

56:55.333 --> 56:57.000
Wait a minute, what are you doing?

57:27.708 --> 57:28.958
What's going on, man?

57:29.541 --> 57:31.333
Thando, let's go!

57:35.583 --> 57:36.666
I don't know, man.

57:39.416 --> 57:42.041
-Where are they taking my girl?
-Dude…

57:44.166 --> 57:46.041
You're taking me for a fool.

57:47.250 --> 57:49.000
You're taking me for a fool, man.

57:52.750 --> 57:55.041
Where's my girlfriend?

57:55.125 --> 57:58.041
Wait, man!

57:58.625 --> 58:02.250
That man promised me a lot of money.

58:02.333 --> 58:03.208
Who?

58:03.291 --> 58:04.625
Who do you think?

58:06.375 --> 58:08.500
I told you to stay away from that man.

58:12.041 --> 58:13.583
You hit me hard, man.

58:14.291 --> 58:17.750
He said he wants your girl
to work at the club.

58:18.541 --> 58:19.958
Where is she now?

58:21.208 --> 58:22.041
I don't know.

58:23.333 --> 58:25.166
-I don't know.
-Give me her dad's number.

1:00:47.875 --> 1:00:50.791
-Hi, Dad.
-I see what you're up to.

1:00:51.500 --> 1:00:53.833
You chose him after they stole from us.

1:00:54.416 --> 1:00:56.291
-Dad, no.
-Don't "Dad" me.

1:00:56.375 --> 1:00:58.500
Listen, I saw you with that Nigerian.

1:00:58.583 --> 1:01:00.083
Are you not ashamed?

1:01:00.833 --> 1:01:03.666
Dad, Adze didn't steal anything from you.

1:01:05.083 --> 1:01:06.625
Hey, don't you dare.

1:01:06.708 --> 1:01:09.166
You're telling me
that I was not fast enough?

1:01:09.250 --> 1:01:12.625
After you just broke up with Given.

1:01:12.708 --> 1:01:14.541
Now you're with a Nigerian.

1:01:14.625 --> 1:01:17.541
You know what?
I never thought that one day

1:01:17.625 --> 1:01:20.458
my daughter would be
the prostitute of this place.

1:01:24.583 --> 1:01:27.083
Where are you going?
I want you here tonight!

1:01:27.166 --> 1:01:29.333
Hey, if I see you again
with that foreigner…

1:05:26.458 --> 1:05:27.541
It's okay.

1:05:28.333 --> 1:05:29.250
Relax.

1:05:31.416 --> 1:05:33.208
Payment's in, man.

1:05:34.208 --> 1:05:38.541
Your million rand for those 50 girls
and then my 400,000 rand.

1:05:42.416 --> 1:05:46.333
I told you your stupid school idea
was a bad one.

1:05:46.416 --> 1:05:47.833
It's too close to home.

1:05:57.833 --> 1:05:59.833
Bring it here. Let's see.

1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:05.750
Oh, she's really pretty.

1:06:08.583 --> 1:06:09.916
How much?

1:06:16.666 --> 1:06:18.458
You are a trusted man.

1:06:19.625 --> 1:06:22.000
Let's close it off at 100,000 rand.

1:06:28.750 --> 1:06:31.041
This country is so rotten.

1:06:40.333 --> 1:06:42.250
I hear you, man.

1:06:43.250 --> 1:06:44.708
Look after your boys.

1:06:44.791 --> 1:06:48.125
I will give you all your money
after I get that whore.

1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:10.875
So long, man.

1:07:20.375 --> 1:07:21.250
Come in.

1:07:25.791 --> 1:07:27.041
What brings you here?

1:07:27.125 --> 1:07:29.166
My money for Nicki.

1:07:29.250 --> 1:07:32.000
You'll get it
when those girls get shipped off.

1:07:32.083 --> 1:07:33.875
Get shipped off? To where?

1:07:35.041 --> 1:07:36.375
-Overseas.
-Over…

1:07:36.958 --> 1:07:38.500
You didn't mention that to me.

1:07:39.125 --> 1:07:40.958
I don't have to tell you shit.

1:07:41.666 --> 1:07:44.250
You're screwing me over now, Bra Sol.

1:07:44.333 --> 1:07:45.750
Did you tell someone?

1:07:48.583 --> 1:07:50.000
I can see you're lying.

1:07:52.708 --> 1:07:55.416
I hope for your little sister's sake
you're not lying to me.

1:07:55.958 --> 1:07:59.125
I make a lot of money with little girls.
Do you get me?

1:08:01.583 --> 1:08:05.000
Bra Sol, I can't betray my friend.

1:08:05.708 --> 1:08:09.583
I'm sure there's another way
we can make money.

1:08:11.541 --> 1:08:13.500
There is something we can do.

1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:18.125
We need to call her father
and ask for a ransom.

1:08:20.083 --> 1:08:22.583
You collect that money and bring it to me.

1:08:22.666 --> 1:08:24.666
Then you get the girl back.

1:08:25.416 --> 1:08:29.041
It won't work.

1:08:29.125 --> 1:08:32.166
The shipment is departing in two hours.

1:10:15.333 --> 1:10:16.791
Tell them the truth, man.

1:12:16.666 --> 1:12:18.125
What are they saying?

1:12:22.583 --> 1:12:24.041
Step on it, Thando.

1:12:28.416 --> 1:12:31.208
Our mother

1:12:31.291 --> 1:12:34.708
Our mother

1:12:34.791 --> 1:12:36.791
Our mother

1:12:38.208 --> 1:12:40.583
GET LOST

1:12:41.166 --> 1:12:43.791
Our mother

1:12:44.375 --> 1:12:47.458
Our mother

1:12:47.541 --> 1:12:49.125
Our mother

1:12:49.208 --> 1:12:52.166
-Hush, don't cry
-Our mother

1:12:52.791 --> 1:12:56.666
-Wipe your tears
-Our mother

1:12:56.750 --> 1:13:00.041
Our mother

1:13:00.125 --> 1:13:02.416
Our mother

1:13:03.166 --> 1:13:05.250
Our mother

1:13:48.708 --> 1:13:51.083
Our mother

1:13:51.833 --> 1:13:53.166
Our mother

1:13:55.875 --> 1:13:57.250
Listen up, soldiers!

1:13:58.041 --> 1:14:00.625
We are here now, right?

1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.291
-To hell with the foreigners!
-To hell!

1:14:14.375 --> 1:14:15.875
-Salute to the soldiers!
-Salute!

1:14:27.625 --> 1:14:30.541
-To hell with foreigners!
-To hell!

1:18:23.125 --> 1:18:25.333
Listen up.
Some of you must take this corner,

1:18:25.416 --> 1:18:28.375
while others take this side
and lock them inside.

1:18:28.458 --> 1:18:31.666
Salute, soldiers! Let's go!

1:19:17.958 --> 1:19:21.125
Gents, this idiot is inside.

1:19:21.208 --> 1:19:23.791
We need to show him who we truly are.

1:19:23.875 --> 1:19:27.333
I want you to box him in from that side.

1:19:27.416 --> 1:19:29.375
Let's show them
who's the boss here. Right?

1:20:06.708 --> 1:20:10.166
Let's go. Lock him in.
We don't have time for this.

1:20:54.750 --> 1:20:57.000
What do you say? Should we do this?

1:21:17.666 --> 1:21:18.958
Hi, Bra Sol.

1:21:19.875 --> 1:21:21.750
It's me, Thando.

1:21:24.333 --> 1:21:26.416
Yes, the deal is on now.

1:21:28.333 --> 1:21:30.916
Yes, he's bringing
the whole half a million.

1:21:34.916 --> 1:21:38.125
You know that guy… I'm good at my job,

1:21:38.208 --> 1:21:41.583
so I got there and told him
that I need the money right now.

1:21:41.666 --> 1:21:43.916
Plus, my mom told me they have a safe.

1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:46.333
I told him
if he doesn't pay up the half a million,

1:21:46.416 --> 1:21:48.541
we're killing his daughter. No joke.

1:21:54.333 --> 1:21:56.375
I will never let you down.

1:21:57.083 --> 1:22:02.083
Can we meet at Rand Club?
Say in 20 minutes.

1:22:02.666 --> 1:22:03.625
Cool.

1:23:02.125 --> 1:23:04.791
Where are you, my child? You're late.

1:23:04.875 --> 1:23:07.208
I was just held up at work, Mom.

1:23:07.291 --> 1:23:13.625
Remember that in this family,
we are trustworthy.

1:23:13.708 --> 1:23:16.625
I'm still keeping my word.

1:23:17.916 --> 1:23:19.458
I'll see you later.

1:23:19.541 --> 1:23:20.791
That's fine.

1:25:06.541 --> 1:25:07.791
Wiseman.

1:25:08.625 --> 1:25:09.916
It's done.

1:25:11.125 --> 1:25:12.250
It's done now.

1:25:13.708 --> 1:25:15.875
We're going to show this stupid foreigner

1:25:15.958 --> 1:25:18.458
who we truly are in this neighborhood.

1:25:18.541 --> 1:25:19.791
It's deserved.

1:25:20.541 --> 1:25:21.708
Just hold on a bit.

1:25:27.333 --> 1:25:29.208
Palesa is inside.

1:25:37.875 --> 1:25:41.333
Please, guys!

1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:05.458
Wait, wait!

1:26:17.875 --> 1:26:19.625
Please open up, Dad!

1:26:20.416 --> 1:26:21.250
Wait.

1:26:25.541 --> 1:26:26.791
Thando, the cops.

1:26:34.291 --> 1:26:35.708
Maybe they can help us, man.

1:26:35.791 --> 1:26:38.958
Have you forgotten that we stole this car?
Stop being an idiot.

1:27:34.541 --> 1:27:35.750
No, man.

1:27:36.708 --> 1:27:38.958
No, man. Out, out.

1:30:04.750 --> 1:30:05.791
We lost them.

1:31:23.083 --> 1:31:24.250
Isn't that Bra Sol?

1:31:24.833 --> 1:31:26.083
It's him.

1:33:09.583 --> 1:33:10.416
What?
