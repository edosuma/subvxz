DIRECTOR:
Okay, quiet, everyone.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.064
Cameras rolling.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.234
We go live in five... four...

01:48.275 --> 01:50.027
NEWSREADER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:50.069 --> 01:54.240
the Reichsfuhrer
of North America.

01:54.281 --> 01:57.576
My fellow Americans.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.079
The last few days

02:00.120 --> 02:03.749
have been difficult for us all.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.960
Heinrich Himmler

02:06.001 --> 02:07.795
was a father to our people.

02:07.837 --> 02:10.798
We mourn his loss.

02:12.842 --> 02:16.846
But with his passing
comes an opportunity

02:16.887 --> 02:20.558
for rebirth and renewal.

02:20.599 --> 02:24.019
A change has come
to the Western states,

02:24.061 --> 02:25.479
and with it,

02:25.521 --> 02:29.149
a chance to take
our divided land

02:29.191 --> 02:31.694
and bring it back together.

02:31.735 --> 02:34.405
A great transformation
is coming.

02:34.446 --> 02:37.741
Soon,

02:37.783 --> 02:40.744
we will be one nation again.

02:40.786 --> 02:43.205
DIRECTOR:
And clear.

02:43.247 --> 02:45.583
(applause)

02:45.624 --> 02:49.670
Let's wrap it up, everyone.

02:49.712 --> 02:51.714
Thanks, Ted.

02:52.798 --> 02:54.967
-Great speech.
-Thanks, Bill.

02:55.009 --> 02:57.761
-How'd I do?
-You were wonderful, Daddy.

02:57.803 --> 03:00.180
-Good.
-Reichsfuhrer, our meeting
with high command

03:00.222 --> 03:01.599
-is about to begin, so...
-John,

03:01.640 --> 03:03.183
I need a moment in private.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.269
Give us a moment.

03:05.311 --> 03:07.563
Of course.

03:07.605 --> 03:09.023
Stay with Bridget, girls.

03:09.064 --> 03:10.900
JENNIFER:
Yes, Mother.

03:10.941 --> 03:12.484
Sorry, Helen,

03:12.526 --> 03:14.737
I haven't had the chance
to get back to the apartment

03:14.778 --> 03:17.197
since the plane touched down.

03:22.286 --> 03:24.038
So what is it?

03:24.079 --> 03:26.749
Two SS came by the apartment
this morning.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.918
They tore out a rat's nest

03:28.959 --> 03:31.670
of wires and microphones
from our walls, our phones...

03:31.712 --> 03:33.923
They were acting
on my orders, Helen.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.966
Are you sure
they got everything?

03:36.008 --> 03:39.053
Hoover is no longer a problem.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.682
Oh...

03:45.517 --> 03:47.478
But I'm not just thinking
about Hoover.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.521
No.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.484
You don't need to worry.

03:53.525 --> 03:56.236
Our family is no longer
in danger from Berlin.

04:01.659 --> 04:04.578
You know, a long time ago,

04:04.620 --> 04:06.872
we told ourselves that if
we ever had the chance,

04:06.914 --> 04:09.667
-we might do things differently.
-(knocking on door)

04:09.708 --> 04:13.128
A moment, please.

04:19.677 --> 04:21.220
John, there are things
that we need

04:21.261 --> 04:24.640
-to discuss privately.
-Yes, I know,

04:24.682 --> 04:26.642
but we can't discuss them here.

04:26.684 --> 04:29.687
-Then when?
-The day after tomorrow,

04:29.728 --> 04:32.982
I'm gonna be taking a train
to the Poconos, 11:00 a.m.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.693
I'd like you to join me.

04:35.734 --> 04:39.405
Everything's gonna be
made clear, I promise.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.533
-All right.
-Come in.

04:45.202 --> 04:48.539
Gentlemen, take your seats.

04:48.580 --> 04:52.126
Sir, this has just arrived
from Berlin.

04:52.167 --> 04:55.421
Sir, it's plans for Phase Five.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.591
AMY:
Mom? Are you coming?

05:03.804 --> 05:06.098
BELLOWS:
I am giving him cephalosporin

05:06.140 --> 05:09.018
to fight infection.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.936
His wounds are healing,

05:10.978 --> 05:12.813
but the stitches
won't be ready to come out

05:12.855 --> 05:16.400
for another week or so.

05:16.442 --> 05:18.819
Gestapo really
scoured that clinic

05:18.861 --> 05:21.280
looking for the bodyguard,
and we got the nurse to safety,

05:21.321 --> 05:23.073
-but...
-Well, it's only
a matter of time

05:23.115 --> 05:25.617
before they come
rolling through Harlem

05:25.659 --> 05:28.162
going house to house.

05:28.203 --> 05:31.331
We're gonna gamble that we're
safe for another 24 hours.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.459
You should go, though.
Get to the Poconos.

05:33.500 --> 05:34.960
What about Helen?

05:36.628 --> 05:38.088
You know, I...

05:38.130 --> 05:40.632
I'm not sure anything I said
had an effect on her, honestly.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.134
She was terrified.

05:42.176 --> 05:46.013
We've come this far.
We have to finish it.

05:46.055 --> 05:48.307
BELLOWS:
Well, you took your chance,

05:48.348 --> 05:50.768
and it, uh,
it was worth a chance.

05:50.809 --> 05:53.312
Thank you.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.355
Well, it's not over.
We've got 400 people

05:55.397 --> 05:57.107
ready to make an assault
on the portal.

05:59.943 --> 06:01.570
Something's coming, you know.

06:03.614 --> 06:06.033
I don't know what it is,
but I've been sensing it.

06:06.075 --> 06:07.451
BELLOWS:
Well, that's all the more reason

06:07.493 --> 06:09.870
to blow it to kingdom come,
right? (chuckles)

06:09.912 --> 06:12.122
It's an abomination.

06:12.164 --> 06:15.834
It's only an abomination
'cause the Nazis control it.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.587
But what if we controlled it?

06:18.629 --> 06:21.090
That's a doorway to a universe

06:21.131 --> 06:23.342
where the Allies won the war.

06:23.383 --> 06:27.262
I don't know that anyone
can control it for long.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.640
BELLOWS:
I guess we'll see you
in the Poconos?

06:29.681 --> 06:31.600
WYATT:
We'll be waiting.

06:31.642 --> 06:34.686
Take good care of our boy here.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.897
Be careful.
He, uh, he cheats at cards.

06:36.939 --> 06:38.899
Sometimes you got to even
the odds, you know what I mean?

06:38.941 --> 06:41.735
Uh-huh.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.697
(harmonica playing)

06:59.670 --> 07:01.672
(voices speaking indistinctly)

07:03.132 --> 07:05.175
OSCAR:
Hey. I said y'all can't
be back... (grunting)

07:05.217 --> 07:07.219
(metallic clanking, body thuds)

07:17.980 --> 07:20.399
He's in there, all right.
Open that.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.245
Whoa.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.289
Hmm.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.296
"Warning.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.631
Doku."

07:44.673 --> 07:46.925
That's poison.

08:05.611 --> 08:08.488
(gas hissing)

08:13.535 --> 08:15.245
That should do it, right there.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.508
(hissing stops)

08:35.182 --> 08:38.727
-Shit.
-(metallic clanging)

08:38.769 --> 08:41.521
Tank's empty.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.523
(groans)

08:43.565 --> 08:44.900
Is there another tank?

08:44.942 --> 08:47.236
DOYLE:
Fuck. Leave it.

08:47.277 --> 08:50.072
We'll string him up
like we planned.

09:04.836 --> 09:06.630
-(grunting)
-(gunshots)
-Oh, shit!

09:35.742 --> 09:36.743
It's good.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.580
Follow me.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.251
We will give you travel permits.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.880
Thank you.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.674
CHILDAN:
Okami-san, thank you
for seeing me.

09:50.716 --> 09:54.136
I have a-a unique
proposal for you.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.387
I know you'll want to

09:55.429 --> 09:57.014
hear this personally.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.599
I'm a businessman,
much like yourself.

09:59.641 --> 10:02.227
You're nothing like myself.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.895
Okay.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.859
I'm a businessman.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.945
I have a shop filled

10:11.987 --> 10:13.989
with valuable Americana.

10:14.031 --> 10:16.950
There's nothing else
like it, anywhere.

10:16.992 --> 10:20.454
Do we know this store?

10:23.081 --> 10:25.876
I understand you have a trawler

10:25.917 --> 10:29.629
that's going to Japan.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.631
These are the keys to my shop.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.884
You put me on that boat...

10:36.261 --> 10:38.221
-...and it's yours.
-(gunshots)

10:38.263 --> 10:39.765
(screaming)

10:50.233 --> 10:53.362
I want my son.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.656
Bring me Colonel Kido's son.

11:00.077 --> 11:02.120
OKAMI:
He owes.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.331
I can pay his debts.

11:04.373 --> 11:07.292
The yen is no good here anymore.

11:07.334 --> 11:10.504
We must return to the old ways.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.547
I am familiar with the old ways.

11:12.589 --> 11:15.634
I know you are, Taisa.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.303
I have no doubt you would gun us

11:18.345 --> 11:20.806
all down, but if you did,

11:20.847 --> 11:23.433
you wouldn't last long,

11:23.475 --> 11:27.437
and neither would your boy.

11:27.479 --> 11:31.108
So we must barter for his life.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.780
What do you want?

11:36.822 --> 11:40.242
I want you to serve me
as my saiko-komon,

11:40.283 --> 11:44.246
my supreme adviser.

11:44.287 --> 11:46.373
Don't do this.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.583
These are my debts.

11:52.963 --> 11:55.173
(Okami speaking Japanese)

11:55.215 --> 11:59.594
Are you prepared to become a
member of the Ninkyo Dantai?

12:02.222 --> 12:03.223
I am.

12:08.353 --> 12:09.729
For the boat.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.275
You should go now.

12:13.316 --> 12:16.945
This is not
for your eyes to see.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.128
Bow to me, Kido.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.172
As your Oyabun.

12:52.230 --> 12:57.861
Takeshi Kido is Yakuza now.

13:02.574 --> 13:06.119
There's still one last thing
left to do.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.459
(snaps, squelches)

13:54.501 --> 13:56.086
(grunts)

13:56.127 --> 13:58.129
(elevator bell dings)

13:58.171 --> 14:00.173
(thunder rumbles outside)

14:17.232 --> 14:18.650
(door knob rattles)

14:18.692 --> 14:20.694
(door closes)

14:39.129 --> 14:40.672
John.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.096
I'm working late.

14:50.265 --> 14:51.975
Maybe you should go to bed.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.899
(pen tapping)

15:03.612 --> 15:05.614
(indistinct chatter)

15:07.991 --> 15:09.993
MAN:
Yeah, go. Go 'round back.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.330
BELL:
Hide those gun positions.

15:13.371 --> 15:15.790
Make it look like a town,
not a base.

15:15.832 --> 15:18.627
-Let's get those RPGs up front.
-CARLOS: Comandante.

15:18.668 --> 15:21.713
We've marked off where Aztlan
guerrillas are setting up

15:21.755 --> 15:24.716
sniper stations and booby traps
in the Mission District.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.551
DARIUS:
We'll get you the same
on our end.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.553
We'll also set up
a chalk code to flag houses

15:28.595 --> 15:30.889
that are safe
and ones we've booby-trapped.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.140
CARLOS:
Muy bien.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.142
AVRAM:
Sabra has set up
medic stations in all

15:34.184 --> 15:36.603
of the districts, we also have
a medevac team down at the pier.

15:36.645 --> 15:38.063
But we are still evacuating

15:38.104 --> 15:41.524
children and elderly
to our camps in the Sierras.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.903
-Pablo.
-PABLO: ¿Sí?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.946
CARLOS:
Okay... (speaking Spanish)

15:50.659 --> 15:52.661
BELL:
What've you got for us, Lem?

15:52.702 --> 15:55.121
Volunteers
from the Neutral Zone.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.126
What's this?

16:00.168 --> 16:02.921
LEM:
Deserters from the Wehrmacht.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.964
They're not the only ones,
either.

16:05.006 --> 16:06.966
They just keep
crossing the border.

16:07.008 --> 16:08.468
What the hell am I
supposed to do with them?

16:08.510 --> 16:09.803
Give them a rifle?

16:09.844 --> 16:11.388
We put 'em to work.

16:11.429 --> 16:12.764
They're Nazis, Lem.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.891
No, they were Nazis.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.104
Get them out of those uniforms.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.856
We'll... put them to work
scrubbing pots.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.109
-Huh.
-Don't let Elijah
see them, either.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.152
Oh. They brought
something else, too.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.329
-I'll be damned.
-Mm-hmm.

16:40.291 --> 16:43.128
After all that bullshit,
the dumbass cracker

16:43.169 --> 16:44.754
let Kido get away.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.638
The fuck is this?

16:53.680 --> 16:56.391
Lem says there's senior Nazi
officers going cold

16:56.433 --> 16:58.059
-on the Reich.
-LEM: People there

16:58.101 --> 16:59.561
saw what happened here.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.521
They see a chance to have
their own country.

17:01.563 --> 17:02.856
The way it used to be.

17:02.897 --> 17:04.858
The way it used to be?

17:04.899 --> 17:06.609
Do you remember
how it used to be, brother?

17:06.651 --> 17:08.570
If there's one thing that can
split the Reich in two,

17:08.611 --> 17:10.655
it's this flag.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.699
All them goddamn Nazis
used to be Americans once.

17:12.741 --> 17:15.243
And all those white Americans
are Nazis now.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.455
Look.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.999
You are facing a war...

17:21.040 --> 17:24.085
which you cannot win.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.087
I'm sorry,
somebody's got to say it.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.553
Man, this flag
ain't never done shit for us.

17:33.595 --> 17:34.888
That ain't what we fought for.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.723
That America's gone.

17:36.765 --> 17:39.267
I'm sorry, Lem.

17:39.309 --> 17:41.811
I know what
you're trying to do...

17:42.896 --> 17:45.440
...but we can never go back.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.442
(clears throat)

17:47.484 --> 17:49.110
(clicks tongue)

17:49.152 --> 17:51.154
Fair enough.

17:52.197 --> 17:55.575
But you still need
to send a message.

17:55.617 --> 17:57.285
And y'all better do it quick.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.329
'Cause y'all can't
hold out too long here.

18:19.390 --> 18:21.976
The Empire TV station.
Is it still functional?

18:22.018 --> 18:23.478
-Can we get in there?
-Sure 'nough.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.480
This whole city's ours.

18:25.522 --> 18:28.608
NEWSREADER:
Now, in news
from the Western States.

18:28.650 --> 18:31.361
Letters have been streaming in
to Reich headquarters

18:31.402 --> 18:34.948
from ordinary Americans facing
the nightmare of Negro rule.

18:34.989 --> 18:37.158
Their stories
are heartbreaking.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.910
-But the Reich has heard...
-(footsteps approaching)

18:38.952 --> 18:40.620
-...their pleas for help.
-There you go, sweetie.

18:40.662 --> 18:43.790
In a matter of days,
the campaign of liberation

18:43.832 --> 18:46.042
is set to begin on orders
of Reichsfuhrer John Smith.

18:46.084 --> 18:48.878
We take you now to a report

18:48.920 --> 18:51.089
-from our armored...
-MAN (crackling): You know?

18:51.130 --> 18:52.423
-...in the Neutral Zone...
-We have the sound. Testing,

18:52.465 --> 18:53.800
-Wha-What's happening?
-one, two, three. Clear.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.510
Move the antenna.

18:55.552 --> 18:56.970
-(signal flickering, crackling)
-BELL: We good?

18:57.011 --> 18:58.346
MAN:
Go ahead, sister.

18:58.388 --> 19:00.098
Ladies and gentlemen.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.641
-Do not adjust your TV sets.
-JENNIFER: A Negro?

19:01.683 --> 19:03.685
There is nothing wrong.

19:03.726 --> 19:06.354
We have interrupted your
regularly scheduled

19:06.396 --> 19:08.147
Nazi propaganda

19:08.189 --> 19:09.899
to bring you the truth.

19:09.941 --> 19:12.902
-Something's wrong. Turn it off.
-No, I want to hear this.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.576
We are the people.

19:19.617 --> 19:21.995
Along with so many others

19:22.036 --> 19:25.081
that the Nazis tried
to exterminate in their camps.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.085
They murdered...

19:29.127 --> 19:30.753
millions of us.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.715
But they failed.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.008
Cut it off, now.

19:35.049 --> 19:36.509
BELL:
We're still here.

19:36.551 --> 19:38.636
METZGER:
It's coming out
of the former JPS.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.264
They've broken into
our broadcast band.

19:41.306 --> 19:42.640
Now we are free.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.226
The relay transmitters will be
destroyed in minutes, sir.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.812
And you... are slaves

19:47.854 --> 19:50.440
to humanity's greatest lie.

19:52.442 --> 19:54.777
But we can help you
free yourselves.

19:54.819 --> 19:57.488
A long time ago, America made

19:57.530 --> 20:00.241
a promise...
but it was never kept.

20:02.243 --> 20:03.953
We mean to deliver

20:03.995 --> 20:06.831
on that promise.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.833
We have founded a new nation.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.169
If you can hear my voice,

20:11.210 --> 20:13.254
you are already a citizen.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.757
-Holy fucking shit.
-Mom!

20:15.798 --> 20:17.091
-But the first step
to freedom...
-Shh.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.677
...you must take
inside your own mind.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.722
You don't have
to fight this war.

20:22.764 --> 20:25.892
Desert your post.

20:25.934 --> 20:27.936
Say your gun jammed.

20:27.977 --> 20:29.687
There was sand in the gears.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.856
There's a thousand ways
to resist.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.733
(crackling)

20:33.775 --> 20:36.069
(static hissing)

20:36.110 --> 20:38.905
-(test tone)
-Are we on?

20:38.947 --> 20:40.949
We take you now to a report

20:40.990 --> 20:42.575
from our armored troops
in the Neutral Zone.

20:42.617 --> 20:45.328
GENERAL:
Foolish, poking the bear.

20:45.370 --> 20:48.289
-These tanks of the 51st...
-It won't make any difference.

20:48.331 --> 20:50.708
...passing in the deserts
of New Mexico.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.669
Commanders here are readying
themselves

20:52.710 --> 20:54.337
for the order to liberate

20:54.379 --> 20:56.047
-the Western states.
-(television clicks off)

20:56.089 --> 20:57.507
Amy, go to your room.

20:57.548 --> 20:59.926
You're not my mother,
you can't tell me to go

20:59.968 --> 21:02.095
-to my room.
-You don't want to hear this.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.888
Sweetheart.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.598
It's, it's time for bed.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.101
Come on, I'll tuck you in
in a minute.

21:12.563 --> 21:15.274
It was you.

21:15.316 --> 21:17.276
You and Daddy. You killed them.

21:17.318 --> 21:20.196
Killed who?

21:20.238 --> 21:21.823
The Negroes, the Jews,
all those people.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.241
What happened to them?

21:23.282 --> 21:25.493
Oh.

21:25.535 --> 21:27.412
-I need to hear it from you.
-Okay, uh,

21:27.453 --> 21:29.372
they, they...

21:29.414 --> 21:30.832
they sent them to camps.

21:30.873 --> 21:33.251
And what did they do
in the camps?

21:33.292 --> 21:35.795
They forced them to work.

21:35.837 --> 21:37.547
Then what?

21:37.588 --> 21:39.132
Where are they now?

21:39.173 --> 21:41.592
(exhales slowly)

21:43.928 --> 21:45.221
(inhales sharply)

21:45.263 --> 21:47.348
They're gone.

21:47.390 --> 21:49.517
They killed them.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.980
And you and Daddy
were a part of it.

21:54.022 --> 21:56.524
Yes.

21:56.566 --> 21:58.651
Yes, we were.

22:05.283 --> 22:06.993
It... (sighs)

22:07.035 --> 22:08.745
It was a different time.

22:09.746 --> 22:12.790
We felt like our world...

22:14.792 --> 22:16.627
It had just ended,
it was a decision

22:16.669 --> 22:19.714
that we made for one day
that led to 20 years.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.466
You could have escaped
to the Neutral Zone.

22:21.507 --> 22:24.594
Yeah, we could have, yes.
But we didn't.

22:24.635 --> 22:27.055
So you joined the Party instead.

22:29.140 --> 22:30.975
Daddy was in the SS.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.394
I did it because I...

22:33.436 --> 22:35.605
well, I believed in it.

22:35.646 --> 22:38.649
Not at first, but later I-I...

22:38.691 --> 22:41.110
-I believed in all of it.
-The camps where they killed

22:41.152 --> 22:43.321
-the Jews and the Negroes?
-All of it.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.198
All of it. They told us
it was necessary.

22:45.239 --> 22:47.200
I didn't ask any questions.
I didn't even

22:47.241 --> 22:50.036
think about those people
until...

22:57.210 --> 22:59.378
Oh.

23:01.631 --> 23:04.592
Until we became those people.

23:06.010 --> 23:07.970
You got all this.

23:08.012 --> 23:10.389
We didn't do it for this.

23:10.431 --> 23:12.350
We did it to keep you alive.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.185
You didn't keep
Thomas alive, did you?

23:14.227 --> 23:17.271
Oh, God, Jennifer, don't you
think that I know that?

23:17.313 --> 23:18.815
-They took him away.
-I am begging you,

23:18.856 --> 23:20.483
-please, please, please.
-They poisoned him!

23:20.525 --> 23:21.818
Don't, don't do this.

23:21.859 --> 23:24.445
He was my brother.
I loved him, too.

23:24.487 --> 23:28.366
Ye-- I know how
you must see us, but...

23:28.407 --> 23:30.368
Everything we have was bought

23:30.409 --> 23:32.411
with other people's lives.

23:32.453 --> 23:34.163
You were our children.

23:34.205 --> 23:36.916
Our babies.

23:36.958 --> 23:39.669
How many were there? (sniffles)

23:39.710 --> 23:41.087
In America.

23:41.129 --> 23:42.755
In Europe,

23:42.797 --> 23:44.173
in Africa, how many?

23:44.215 --> 23:45.967
I-I don't...

23:46.008 --> 23:47.677
-I don't know.
-And they're gonna do it

23:47.718 --> 23:50.555
all over again, aren't they?
(sniffles)

23:50.596 --> 23:53.307
And Daddy's gonna be
in charge, isn't he?

23:53.349 --> 23:55.101
I don't know.

23:57.687 --> 23:59.147
(shuddering inhale)

23:59.188 --> 24:01.190
I don't ever want
to be like you.

24:04.569 --> 24:07.738
You shouldn't have to be.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.574
(shuddering breaths)

24:09.615 --> 24:10.825
(sniffles)

24:10.867 --> 24:12.869
(Jennifer sniffling)

24:32.889 --> 24:34.473
(drawer slides shut)

24:49.030 --> 24:51.032
(lock clicks)

26:28.587 --> 26:31.257
(footsteps retreating)

26:31.299 --> 26:33.301
-Thank you, gentlemen.
-(indistinct conversation)

26:36.595 --> 26:38.806
-Good night.
-(sighs)

26:43.602 --> 26:45.563
Reichsfuhrer.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.606
A word, if I may?

26:48.941 --> 26:51.444
Your wife's minder,
Agent Martha Stroud,

26:51.485 --> 26:53.487
has disappeared, sir.

26:53.529 --> 26:56.824
She was last seen
guarding your wife

26:56.866 --> 26:58.993
at the Davenport Women's Clinic.

26:59.035 --> 27:00.870
She never returned to her post.

27:00.911 --> 27:02.621
Or her apartment.

27:02.663 --> 27:05.082
A thorough search has been
conducted, but no body found.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.293
However, we did find this...

27:07.335 --> 27:09.211
in the clinic incinerator.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.635
Staatspolizei believe

27:16.677 --> 27:19.513
that she's been murdered
by the Resistance, sir.

27:25.394 --> 27:26.979
(blues song plays faintly)

27:27.021 --> 27:29.273
JULIANA:
Well, this isn't
gonna feel good.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.608
♪ Way up in... ♪

27:30.649 --> 27:33.235
-Deep breath.
-(inhales sharply)

27:37.740 --> 27:38.949
That's not too bad, actually.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.577
(soft chuckle)

27:41.619 --> 27:44.246
You know, in all honesty,
I'd be better off

27:44.288 --> 27:45.581
drinking that rotgut.

27:45.623 --> 27:47.375
Take the edge off.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.251
Well, when your dressing's
changed, maybe I'll

27:49.293 --> 27:50.503
pour two fingers
in a glass for you.

27:50.544 --> 27:53.464
Ah, see, now you're talking.

27:57.134 --> 28:00.888
What happened in that clinic...

28:00.930 --> 28:02.890
I know.

28:05.017 --> 28:09.021
I like to think I can handle
most situations, but...

28:09.063 --> 28:11.065
fuck.

28:13.442 --> 28:16.404
I don't know if I have
the stomach for this anymore.

28:16.445 --> 28:18.864
I'm sick and tired
of being Wyatt Price,

28:18.906 --> 28:20.533
I can tell you that much.

28:20.574 --> 28:23.619
Well, good news,

28:23.661 --> 28:26.539
you've always been Liam,
far as I'm concerned.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.294
Listen...

28:35.005 --> 28:38.259
I hope you can understand
why I've kept my distance.

28:41.971 --> 28:44.140
A lot of people
have gotten hurt around me.

28:44.181 --> 28:48.519
A lot of people
got hurt around me, too.

28:50.563 --> 28:53.482
I didn't want it
to happen to you.

28:53.524 --> 28:56.444
But it didn't happen.

28:56.485 --> 29:00.030
Because you were there.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.907
I'll go when it's my time.

29:03.159 --> 29:05.286
For now,

29:05.327 --> 29:07.997
I just take each day
that's given to me.

29:08.038 --> 29:11.542
(whispering):
But you can still leave.

29:11.584 --> 29:13.961
You have choices.

29:14.003 --> 29:17.089
You can live in any world
you want to.

29:17.131 --> 29:19.925
(laughs softly)

29:19.967 --> 29:24.430
You know, I've seen a lot
of versions of my life.

29:24.472 --> 29:29.518
But there's only one with people
in it who understand me.

29:29.560 --> 29:32.271
So...

29:33.481 --> 29:35.483
...no.

29:39.236 --> 29:41.405
(exhales)
Thank you.

29:41.447 --> 29:43.240
-Yeah.
-(liquid pouring)

29:45.743 --> 29:47.328
Sir?

29:47.369 --> 29:48.787
(laughs softly)

29:51.165 --> 29:56.879
What did you mean
when you told Bellows

29:56.921 --> 30:00.090
something is coming?

30:00.132 --> 30:03.761
I've seen it, in visions.

30:03.802 --> 30:07.097
-It's not complete, but it's...
-(phone ringing)

30:16.106 --> 30:18.484
(clears throat)

30:18.526 --> 30:20.152
Davenport Women's Clinic.

30:23.030 --> 30:26.825
HELEN (over phone):
I have two daughters.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.286
Yes.

30:29.328 --> 30:32.790
Amy and Jennifer.
Yes, I remember them.

30:35.376 --> 30:39.171
I need to get us out
before anything happens.

30:39.213 --> 30:42.841
I have a brother in Montana.

30:42.883 --> 30:45.427
JULIANA:
We have a network.

30:45.469 --> 30:48.222
Our people will get you
and the girls there safely.

30:49.765 --> 30:52.268
You need to promise me.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.438
You have my word.

31:05.030 --> 31:09.243
The train leaves at 11:00 a.m.
tomorrow for the Poconos.

31:09.285 --> 31:11.745
My husband will be on it.

31:35.811 --> 31:40.316
Aren't you going to eat
your grapefruit, Jennifer?

31:40.357 --> 31:42.484
I have no appetite.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.071
Teenagers.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.623
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to take a raincheck

31:55.664 --> 31:57.249
on our trip today, John.

31:57.291 --> 31:59.877
You may have to go without me.

32:01.128 --> 32:03.088
I'm not feeling well.

32:03.130 --> 32:05.090
Oh.

32:05.132 --> 32:08.761
Is this something
I should be concerned about?

32:08.802 --> 32:12.640
-Oh, it's just, uh...
-It's just what?

32:23.275 --> 32:25.903
It's nothing serious.

32:27.154 --> 32:29.156
Oh.

32:30.532 --> 32:32.493
Well, if it's nothing serious,

32:32.534 --> 32:36.747
then I'll send a car for you
at 10:00 a.m.

32:39.166 --> 32:41.877
See you on the train.

32:46.423 --> 32:48.425
(indistinct chatter)

32:57.976 --> 33:01.355
Tell me, in the gokudo,
do I outrank you?

33:01.397 --> 33:03.148
Yes, saiko-komon.

33:03.190 --> 33:05.192
Then go away.

33:08.070 --> 33:10.030
There are things
that must be said.

33:10.072 --> 33:12.449
-You don't have to...
-I have failed you as a father.

33:12.491 --> 33:15.869
The first duty of a parent
is to protect his child.

33:15.911 --> 33:18.914
-Stop.
-Let me finish.

33:18.956 --> 33:23.961
I never showed
my true affection for you.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.588
I have so many regrets.

33:26.630 --> 33:30.551
I can only say
that you will always be my son.

33:30.592 --> 33:32.594
(boat engine starts)

33:37.474 --> 33:39.810
Come home with me.

33:39.852 --> 33:44.314
-The invasion will begin soon...
-There is no going back.

33:44.356 --> 33:47.526
I have much to atone for,

33:47.568 --> 33:50.612
and I must start here.

33:56.118 --> 33:58.036
Good-bye, Father.

34:37.534 --> 34:39.870
Redline power at 15%.

34:39.912 --> 34:41.955
Follow up.

34:41.997 --> 34:44.374
(indistinct radio chatter)

34:48.879 --> 34:50.589
...6th Airborne Division
will drop on San Francisco.

34:50.631 --> 34:52.508
Helen.

34:55.260 --> 34:58.013
Thanks for being here.

34:58.055 --> 35:01.016
Give us a moment to wrap up
and we can have a private talk.

35:01.058 --> 35:03.685
The corporal
will give you some tea.

35:11.026 --> 35:13.028
-Tea, ma'am?
-Please.

35:16.824 --> 35:18.826
(tea pouring)

35:43.100 --> 35:45.102
(birds twittering)

35:47.145 --> 35:49.147
(electricity buzzing)

35:57.322 --> 35:59.283
It should be right here.

35:59.324 --> 36:01.201
Right there, lads.

36:06.123 --> 36:08.000
JEREMY:
We're at the fence line.

36:08.041 --> 36:09.376
BELLOWS (over radio):
Understood. Good luck.

36:09.418 --> 36:11.712
-Out.
-Copy that.

36:13.630 --> 36:15.757
Bellows has all four companies
in position.

36:15.799 --> 36:17.885
They're ready to move
on our word.

36:17.926 --> 36:19.720
How long have we got?

36:19.761 --> 36:22.389
Roughly 54 minutes.

36:22.431 --> 36:24.057
MAN:
Stand clear.

36:26.059 --> 36:27.686
All right, the power's off.

36:27.728 --> 36:30.439
(clears throat)

36:43.076 --> 36:44.703
Sir, it's from
General Whitcroft.

36:44.745 --> 36:47.748
Strategic Air Command
is awaiting your order

36:47.789 --> 36:50.626
to launch the assault
on San Francisco, sir.

36:55.172 --> 36:57.716
Thank you. That'll be all.

36:57.758 --> 36:58.967
Sir.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.727
Helen?

37:13.482 --> 37:15.484
Take a seat.

37:19.696 --> 37:23.367
Helen, I want to ask you
a question.

37:25.410 --> 37:28.246
And I want you
to answer truthfully.

37:30.499 --> 37:33.543
Have you ever been approached
by the Resistance?

37:41.343 --> 37:43.428
Yes.

37:43.470 --> 37:47.099
Julia Mills, you remember her.

37:50.310 --> 37:52.729
That day
at the department store.

37:54.773 --> 37:59.111
She told me Thomas was alive,
that you'd been to visit him.

37:59.152 --> 38:03.824
She also told me there were
films in our apartment.

38:03.865 --> 38:08.578
I looked, and I found them.

38:11.123 --> 38:13.291
(exhales):
There we were,

38:13.333 --> 38:18.296
all of us, together.
It... it never happened.

38:18.338 --> 38:20.799
And yet, there we were.

38:23.719 --> 38:26.471
What is going on?

38:28.306 --> 38:31.184
Julia Mills
is a terrorist, Helen.

38:33.562 --> 38:36.440
But what she told you is true.

38:38.942 --> 38:42.279
Thomas is alive
in another world, Helen,

38:42.320 --> 38:44.072
and I've been to see him.

38:46.158 --> 38:49.286
What do you mean, another world?

38:49.327 --> 38:51.288
You have to see t-the portal
yourself to understand.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.331
That's why I asked you here.

39:01.631 --> 39:03.008
Lay the charges
all around the base.

39:03.050 --> 39:04.176
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

39:04.217 --> 39:06.595
All right, come here. Come here.

39:06.636 --> 39:11.475
Fill these with sand
and pack them round the charges.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.310
All right?

39:13.351 --> 39:15.729
It'll force the blast
into the column.

39:15.771 --> 39:17.898
We're gonna down this thing
like a fucking tree.

39:21.359 --> 39:24.654
This, this portal
you're talking about...

39:24.696 --> 39:26.531
I-I mean, what?

39:26.573 --> 39:28.742
You've seen it yourself, Helen.

39:28.784 --> 39:31.912
You've seen the movies.
Well, I've been there.

39:31.953 --> 39:33.997
He's alive.

39:36.041 --> 39:38.126
I have had that fantasy
so many times,

39:38.168 --> 39:40.087
but it's just that, John,
it's a fantasy.

39:40.128 --> 39:41.880
No.

39:41.922 --> 39:43.882
He's not...

39:43.924 --> 39:46.093
I've seen him.

39:46.134 --> 39:48.345
Helen, I've seen
our beautiful boy.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.180
He's real.

39:50.222 --> 39:53.433
-(whimpers)
-He's real as you and me.

39:53.475 --> 39:57.020
I want you to... I want you
to have the same thing I had,

39:57.062 --> 39:58.688
Helen,
I want you to see him yourself.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.857
(crying): Well, of course
I want that, but...

40:00.899 --> 40:03.777
He's not sick,
he's healthy, he's strong.

40:03.819 --> 40:06.488
(laughs):
He's doing so well. He's...

40:06.530 --> 40:08.115
(stammers)

40:08.156 --> 40:10.075
There is a war,
and he is enlisted.

40:10.117 --> 40:12.327
-He is so much like our Thomas.
-(stammers)

40:12.369 --> 40:13.995
Uh, but he's-he's not.
He's not our Thomas.

40:14.037 --> 40:15.914
I can see what's gonna happen.

40:15.956 --> 40:19.000
Helen, he's gonna die all over
again unless we do something.

40:19.042 --> 40:21.169
-But we can save him.
-How?

40:24.005 --> 40:25.841
We can bring him home.

40:25.882 --> 40:29.386
You want to bring this boy here?

40:29.427 --> 40:31.346
As what, as a-a prisoner?

40:31.388 --> 40:34.015
Now, I've struggled with it.
I know it's not gonna be easy,

40:34.057 --> 40:35.976
but, uh, I don't think
we have any choice.

40:36.017 --> 40:38.061
I can't lose him again.

40:38.103 --> 40:40.313
He's gonna hate us,
but he's gonna be alive,

40:40.355 --> 40:42.607
-and I can live with that.
-Well, I can't, I can't.

40:42.649 --> 40:45.610
-I can't live with that.
-When you see him again,

40:45.652 --> 40:47.696
you're gonna change your mind.

40:48.738 --> 40:50.949
-No. No!
-Helen...

40:50.991 --> 40:52.784
No.

40:52.826 --> 40:54.661
Thomas is dead.

40:54.703 --> 40:57.414
Amy isn't ours anymore.
Her mind belongs to the state.

40:57.455 --> 41:02.377
And Jennifer, well,
Jennifer has rejected us.

41:02.419 --> 41:05.088
We had three chances
and we wasted them all.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.798
That-that's where
you're wrong, Helen.

41:06.840 --> 41:09.384
If there is a better version
of me out there somewhere,

41:09.426 --> 41:12.429
I want her to have my son,
because you and I,

41:12.470 --> 41:14.222
we don't deserve
to have a child.

41:14.264 --> 41:16.683
You're saying you have a chance
to see your son again

41:16.725 --> 41:18.351
and you're not gonna take it?

41:18.393 --> 41:22.939
I wouldn't want him
to see what we have become.

41:24.024 --> 41:26.234
(videophone buzzing)

41:44.085 --> 41:46.046
Yes.

41:46.087 --> 41:47.672
WHITCROFT:
The 500th Airborne
is ready to deploy.

41:47.714 --> 41:50.467
The Luftwaffe has
recommended we launch.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.510
Everyone's just waiting
your order, sir.

41:58.642 --> 42:00.435
-Give the order.
-Right away, sir.

42:13.990 --> 42:16.701
(distant mechanical humming)

42:17.619 --> 42:19.829
JULIANA:
Listen.

42:21.665 --> 42:24.876
Zero, this is OP. Come in,
Zero, are you receiving?

42:24.918 --> 42:26.711
-Where is it?
-It just passed the marker.

42:26.753 --> 42:29.464
OP says
five clicks out.

42:29.506 --> 42:31.007
Right, let's get
these sandbags in place.

42:31.049 --> 42:32.467
Come on, speed it up.
Let's go!

42:32.509 --> 42:34.678
(indistinct chatter)

42:52.487 --> 42:56.116
I've seen the plans, John.

42:56.157 --> 42:59.703
The plans for the camps.

43:10.213 --> 43:13.008
How did we get here?

43:13.049 --> 43:17.554
You and me, how did we get here?

43:21.558 --> 43:25.478
This thing that we have been
a part of...

43:25.520 --> 43:27.314
it is a crime.

43:27.355 --> 43:31.526
I know.

43:31.568 --> 43:34.612
It has to stop.

43:36.823 --> 43:40.118
I don't know how.

43:44.831 --> 43:46.624
WYATT:
Get to cover!

43:50.462 --> 43:54.090
(gunfire)

43:58.178 --> 44:00.096
Sir! Taking fire!

44:00.138 --> 44:01.598
Inform battalion
we're under attack!

44:01.639 --> 44:03.725
Go! Go, go!

44:03.767 --> 44:06.061
-Go, go!
-Shoot it!

44:06.102 --> 44:08.480
I made arrangements
for the girls.

44:09.898 --> 44:13.360
It was me, John.

44:17.947 --> 44:19.532
I can't stop!

44:21.368 --> 44:22.702
Ah!

44:38.843 --> 44:40.970
-(high-pitched ringing)
-(Smith breathing heavily)

44:41.971 --> 44:43.098
(groans)

44:43.139 --> 44:45.558
(panting)

44:52.565 --> 44:55.110
H... Helen?

44:58.613 --> 45:01.574
Helen?

45:26.433 --> 45:27.809
(muffled):
Sir!

45:27.851 --> 45:29.477
-(gunfire)
-(muffled): Reichsfuhrer!

45:31.354 --> 45:34.190
Sir, we have to go.
Sir, we have to go! Come on!

45:34.232 --> 45:36.401
(explosions)

45:36.443 --> 45:37.861
Get him up! Pick him up!

45:44.701 --> 45:46.661
(muffled shouting)

45:46.703 --> 45:48.705
(muffled gunfire)

46:08.308 --> 46:09.767
(muffled):
Run!

46:16.983 --> 46:18.693
Incoming!

46:38.963 --> 46:41.007
Go! We'll cover you!

46:49.682 --> 46:50.850
WYATT:
Bellows, stay back!

46:50.892 --> 46:52.602
BELLOWS: We've breached
the outer defenses.

46:52.644 --> 46:54.562
D Company is at the mine
entrance now.

46:54.604 --> 46:57.565
We'll meet you at the portal.
Good luck. Out.

47:00.401 --> 47:02.403
(birds singing)

47:04.739 --> 47:06.741
(distant gunfire)

47:40.692 --> 47:42.527
Friendlies. Clear.

47:42.569 --> 47:44.195
We're clear.

47:44.237 --> 47:45.530
(indistinct chatter)

47:45.572 --> 47:46.823
Guys, we gotta move.

47:46.864 --> 47:49.325
Let's go, let's go.

47:49.367 --> 47:52.412
Hey. Where's that bag?

47:52.453 --> 47:53.663
WYATT:
Have you seen Juliana?

47:53.705 --> 47:55.707
BELLOWS:
Haven't seen her. We gotta move.

48:52.930 --> 48:54.932
(birds calling,
insects trilling)

49:07.820 --> 49:09.781
There you are.

49:09.822 --> 49:11.074
(Smith exhales)

49:17.246 --> 49:21.834
We've seen things...
you and me.

49:26.005 --> 49:27.924
Other worlds.

49:31.719 --> 49:33.429
Other lives.

49:33.471 --> 49:37.433
We... we have that in common.

49:40.061 --> 49:43.064
It's unbearable.

49:45.942 --> 49:47.777
To be able
to look through that door

49:47.819 --> 49:50.196
and glimpse all the people
you could have been.

49:53.491 --> 49:55.368
And to know that out of
all of them...

50:01.165 --> 50:04.419
...this is the one you became.

50:12.760 --> 50:14.762
(birds squawking)

50:55.470 --> 50:58.389
(crackling)

51:03.936 --> 51:07.356
Move, move, move!
Get civilians to shelter!

51:07.398 --> 51:10.318
-Luftwaffe planes sighted.
Paratrooper divisions coming in!
-Everybody move!

51:10.359 --> 51:12.236
Move, move!
Get in position! Now!

51:12.278 --> 51:13.696
Go, go, go!

51:13.738 --> 51:15.490
(man shouts indistinctly)

51:15.531 --> 51:17.283
MAN 2:
Everyone get ready!

51:17.325 --> 51:20.453
-Enemy bombers sighted!
-Hurry!

51:20.495 --> 51:22.288
Bombers!

51:25.458 --> 51:27.960
MAN (over radio):
Alpha, this is Hotel.

51:28.002 --> 51:29.962
We have found the Reichsfuhrer.

51:30.004 --> 51:34.342
John Smith is Delta Echo.
Repeat: John Smith is dead.

51:41.098 --> 51:43.518
Sir.

51:50.942 --> 51:54.779
Get me Strategic Air Command.

51:54.821 --> 51:57.281
Now!

53:13.232 --> 53:15.234
(exhales)

53:33.878 --> 53:35.880
(crackling)

53:51.270 --> 53:53.397
(breathing shakily)

53:57.401 --> 53:59.445
(Juliana crying)

53:59.487 --> 54:01.238
(whispering):
Oh, baby.

54:01.280 --> 54:04.033
Baby.

54:15.461 --> 54:17.463
(humming)

54:24.095 --> 54:25.513
(whispering)

54:27.473 --> 54:29.558
It's happening.

54:29.600 --> 54:33.020
The door is open.

54:42.196 --> 54:44.198
JULIANA:
They're coming.

54:49.662 --> 54:51.706
From where?

54:54.208 --> 54:56.419
(whispers):
Everywhere.
