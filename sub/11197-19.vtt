00:33.520 --> 00:35.960
Let us proceed.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.240
Scalpel.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.440
You all right?

01:17.520 --> 01:19.320
What?

01:19.440 --> 01:21.880
Another nightmare?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.840
Yeah.

01:23.960 --> 01:25.680
What about?

01:25.760 --> 01:27.520
Nothing.

01:30.680 --> 01:35.120
l'm fine. Go on back to sleep, Probie.
You got a big day tomorrow.

01:36.080 --> 01:41.440
Hey, you know, if l was doing what
you're doing for my stepfather, l'd...

01:41.520 --> 01:44.480
- l don't know.
- l'm fine with it.

01:45.520 --> 01:47.440
l know you are.

01:47.560 --> 01:51.320
l'm just saying that
l'd be having nightmares, too.

01:55.280 --> 01:57.040
All right.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.560
Listen, T.

02:03.080 --> 02:06.400
You made me feel like one of the team.

02:06.520 --> 02:10.000
lf there's anything l can do, just...

02:10.080 --> 02:14.080
Probie, forget about it. All right?
Now go on back to sleep, man.

02:16.120 --> 02:18.560
- You sure you're OK?
- Yeah.

02:19.520 --> 02:22.480
Yeah, man. Now go on, get outta here.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.120
Major Carter.

04:07.200 --> 04:11.840
Teal'c. l thought you were gonna
get in a few hours of kelno'reem.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.240
l was unable to do so.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.440
Does that happen often?

04:16.519 --> 04:19.279
lt is rare, but it does happen.

04:20.320 --> 04:23.280
Most often when recovering
from an injury.

04:23.360 --> 04:27.200
You look OK to me.
Why don't you try a glass of warm milk?

04:27.320 --> 04:31.280
l would prefer not to consume
bovine lactose at any temperature.

04:32.880 --> 04:36.080
A cup of herbal tea, then. lt can't hurt.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.320
Very well.

04:44.440 --> 04:48.480
You might just be preoccupied
with the upcoming mission.

04:48.600 --> 04:51.040
(Carter's voice fades)

04:52.560 --> 04:55.680
Don't deny you're worried.
lt's all over your face.

04:55.760 --> 04:58.320
What's on my face?

05:01.360 --> 05:06.480
You know, T, maybe Carter's right.
You should think about this a little more.

05:06.600 --> 05:09.760
- What?
- The whole kidney thing.

05:09.880 --> 05:12.960
You're talking about the transplant.

05:13.040 --> 05:16.640
- Yeah, we're talking about the transplant.
- What do l need with two?

05:16.760 --> 05:20.440
Yeah. One'll do you, right?

05:20.560 --> 05:25.200
lsn't it true that you can lead a perfectly
healthy life with just one kidney?

05:30.360 --> 05:32.960
l'll go check on breakfast.

05:34.840 --> 05:37.760
T, this is major surgery.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.640
l know that.

05:40.720 --> 05:45.520
We've gotten second and third opinions,
and they all come back the same.

05:45.600 --> 05:50.560
They're not gonna find a better match
than l am. Either l do this or Brae dies.

05:50.680 --> 05:54.160
And, frankly, after all
Brae's done for me... l owe him.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.600
lf there was another option...

05:56.720 --> 05:59.920
lt's already arranged and booked.
l go in day after tomorrow.

06:00.040 --> 06:01.840
(bell)

06:03.080 --> 06:05.280
Gentlemen... and lady.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.240
Breakfast is served.

06:08.360 --> 06:11.440
That's ''Captain'' to you, Probie.
And it better be good.

06:11.560 --> 06:13.920
(alarm)

06:14.760 --> 06:17.120
(man) We're away, guys.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.360
(man) Pull the charger.
Let's get it outta here.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.520
(man) OK, let's roll.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.480
(sirens)

07:06.760 --> 07:10.640
(dispatcher) Rescue to engine seven.
We have a two-car head-on collision.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.360
One of the vehicles is leaking gas.

07:13.440 --> 07:16.880
Roger that. Confirm location
at Taylor Way overpass.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.200
- Roger that.
- ETA 5 minutes.

07:19.320 --> 07:20.880
- Ten-four.
- Over and out.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
OK, Probie. Get ready to get your feet wet.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.400
- Ready.
- Yes, you are.

07:55.840 --> 07:59.840
Probie, air up.
Ray, stretch out a preconnect.

08:02.920 --> 08:05.920
Terry, l want foam on that line.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.840
Can you hear me?

08:14.880 --> 08:18.560
Chief, we got one adult male
and a kid trapped inside.

08:18.680 --> 08:22.800
The other driver's outside.
The red vehicle's leakin' gas pretty bad.

08:31.480 --> 08:34.960
- (fireman) l got the gas leak.
- (Carter) Great.

08:35.880 --> 08:38.240
Hi there. Can you hear me? Good boy.

08:38.360 --> 08:41.200
l need you to stay still.
We'll get you out soon.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.960
He's alert and responsive.
What have you got?

08:45.040 --> 08:47.200
OK. Give me a hand here.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.240
Let's pop the door.

08:51.240 --> 08:54.800
Stay still. We're gonna get you out.
Come on, Probie.

08:54.920 --> 08:57.080
Hurry up with that clamp

08:57.200 --> 09:00.520
lt's all right. You're gonna be all right.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.640
Easy now. On my count.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.920
Three. Two. One.

09:23.040 --> 09:27.440
(Carter's voice echoes) l need
a charged line Let's get this fire out.

09:36.600 --> 09:39.920
(man's voice echoes)
l can't charge the line

09:42.960 --> 09:45.680
(man's voice echoes)
There's no pressure.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.160
Everybody outta there

10:06.360 --> 10:09.800
T, get your ass outta there.
That's an order.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.200
Save yourself.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.800
l'm getting you out, old man.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.920
Save yourself

10:21.000 --> 10:22.560
No

10:28.040 --> 10:29.840
Teal'c

10:29.920 --> 10:33.920
- Get a medical team down here, now
- (man) Yes, ma'am.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.640
Whatever happened, you seem fine now.

10:43.760 --> 10:47.440
Still, l've never heard of any Jaffa
fainting before, let alone you.

10:47.560 --> 10:49.200
l did not faint.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.120
Sorry, but you did.

10:51.240 --> 10:55.920
One minute l was talking, the next
minute you were lying flat on your back.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.360
Could this be to do with
his inability to kelno'reem earlier?

10:59.440 --> 11:04.240
Kelno'reem meditation is necessary in
order for a Jaffa to rejuvenate his body,

11:04.320 --> 11:09.600
but not being able to do it just once
wouldn't cause you to faint, would it?

11:09.680 --> 11:12.480
No, it would not.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.680
- And you're not in any pain?
- None.

11:17.520 --> 11:21.840
Maybe you were just bored
with what l was saying.

11:22.800 --> 11:25.600
Oh. Fine. On that note, l'll say goodnight.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.160
'Night, Sam.

11:28.240 --> 11:31.520
Prescribe him some warm milk.

11:33.240 --> 11:35.200
l have no intention of remaining.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.240
This has never happened before.
l want to run some tests.

11:38.320 --> 11:41.760
- That would be completely...
- Ah Doctor's orders.

11:43.640 --> 11:46.640
Now close your eyes and try to relax. OK?

11:49.320 --> 11:51.280
Very well.

11:54.080 --> 11:57.680
(O'Neill) You are one lucky son of a bitch.

12:07.080 --> 12:08.880
O'Neill.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.280
Brae.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.360
- Brae, he was in that car.
- What?

12:17.480 --> 12:19.760
- He was in the car.
- Who was?

12:19.880 --> 12:23.440
Brae. Did you get him out?

12:23.560 --> 12:27.520
T, he's two floors up,
waiting for his new kidney.

12:28.720 --> 12:32.240
We're trying to arrange for him
to come down for a little visit.

12:32.320 --> 12:37.280
- What happened to the guy in the car?
- He was dead before we got there.

12:38.240 --> 12:41.040
l could have sworn...

12:41.920 --> 12:45.760
Listen... they're thinking of postponing
the surgery for a day or so.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.800
- l'm fine.
- Sure you are. How's your head?

12:50.240 --> 12:52.880
Pretty bad.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.960
Why don't l go see what
Western medicine has for you, huh?

12:58.320 --> 13:00.560
Chief?

13:01.280 --> 13:03.840
Thanks for being here for me, man.

13:04.960 --> 13:07.200
Any time.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.480
Brae, you old fart, are you still alive?

13:22.600 --> 13:25.680
Chief, you sorry excuse
for a human being.

13:25.760 --> 13:28.960
When are you gonna get the message
and stop visiting me?

13:29.040 --> 13:31.600
Like a moth to flame,
l can't help myself. Hi.

13:31.720 --> 13:35.680
- Hi, Jack. ls he awake?
- Yeah. He's got a little bit of a headache.

13:35.760 --> 13:40.400
l'm not surprised he's in pain.
He was sent flying, the way l hear it.

13:41.120 --> 13:44.320
- Yep. Why don't you go on in?
- Jack?

13:44.440 --> 13:46.800
You go ahead without me.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.480
Um...

13:48.600 --> 13:51.600
Did T say anything about Brae?

13:53.440 --> 13:55.840
About thinking he was the guy in the car?

13:55.960 --> 13:57.280
Yeah.

13:57.400 --> 14:01.680
l mean, he's been mumbling in his sleep.
Do you think he's OK?

14:01.800 --> 14:05.040
Do you think this transplant thing
is making him...?

14:07.040 --> 14:10.640
This is a big deal.
l think it'd mess with anyone's head.

14:12.560 --> 14:18.000
l know a resident psychologist here. l'll
talk with him. He's good. You'll like him.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.160
- Thanks, Jack.
- Yeah.

14:38.720 --> 14:41.680
l don't know what l would do, my love.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.600
You'll never have to know.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.560
(clears throat)

14:51.000 --> 14:55.520
You wanna tell me what the hell
you were thinking? Hm?

14:55.600 --> 14:58.040
l guess l wasn't.

14:58.160 --> 15:02.160
We're firemen. There's risking your life
and there's being stupid.

15:02.280 --> 15:05.760
- Guess which one you picked.
- l know. l know.

15:05.840 --> 15:08.640
His only fault is he wants to help people.

15:08.720 --> 15:10.880
By sacrificing himself.

15:10.960 --> 15:15.040
lt doesn't matter now.
lt's over. He's all right.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.560
No, he's not.

15:21.840 --> 15:24.880
What are you talking about?
You're starting to scare me.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.560
- You should be scared.
- Brae.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.960
Why aren't you burned anywhere?

15:35.560 --> 15:40.080
The car exploded right in your face and
you come away from it... with a headache.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.760
Something's wrong.

15:49.680 --> 15:53.280
- He knows it.
- What is happening?

15:53.400 --> 15:58.160
- l'm sorry. l didn't mean to wake you.
- Wake me?

15:58.240 --> 16:01.200
According to these readings,
you've been fast asleep.

16:01.320 --> 16:04.320
My mind was filled with images.

16:04.440 --> 16:07.760
Thoughts of me,
yet l was not entirely myself.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.440
Happens to humans all the time.

16:10.520 --> 16:14.720
- lt's called dreaming.
- You don't dream while in kelno'reem?

16:14.800 --> 16:20.560
Not in this manner. While in a state of
kelno'reem l am in control of my thoughts.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.240
So how do you feel?

16:25.040 --> 16:27.040
lt was so real.

16:27.160 --> 16:30.640
Ooh, l love when that happens.

16:30.720 --> 16:35.200
lt's not uncommon in the first moments
after one wakes up to feel disoriented.

16:35.320 --> 16:39.120
Not uncommon for humans.
Very strange for Jaffa.

16:39.240 --> 16:42.160
So, Doc, this is Teal'c
we're dealing with here?

16:42.240 --> 16:45.280
Aside from the dreams
and the fainting, he's still well?

16:45.400 --> 16:48.480
And he's still better off
than 99 per cent of my patients.

16:48.600 --> 16:52.560
- Tests show you're in perfect health.
- Good. So he can go back to work?

16:52.640 --> 16:57.840
lf the dreams don't become debilitating
or you faint again, l don't see why not.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.800
- Excellent. Let's go.
- Just two more minutes.

17:00.920 --> 17:05.920
l'd like to perform a routine examination
of his symbiote, and then you can go.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.680
Hi.

17:16.079 --> 17:18.200
- Hi.
- l'm Dr Daniel Jackson.

17:18.280 --> 17:23.280
l'm one of the resident psychologists
here. l heard you might like to talk.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.360
So... Daniel Jackson.

17:31.440 --> 17:34.240
You can just call me Daniel, if you like.

17:34.360 --> 17:37.360
- You think l'm crazy.
- No, not yet. We just met.

17:38.280 --> 17:41.600
- We haven't met before?
- No. No, l don't think so.

17:41.720 --> 17:45.480
- l'm sure we have.
- Maybe in another life or something.

17:45.600 --> 17:49.840
lf you believe in that sort of thing.
Some people do. l just came by to talk.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.760
About what?

17:51.880 --> 17:54.080
Whatever's on your mind.

17:54.200 --> 17:58.080
Possibly about this operation
that's scheduled for tomorrow.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.200
lt's postponed because
you were blown 20ft across a street.

18:01.320 --> 18:06.160
- l'm going through with it.
- l never said you shouldn't.

18:06.240 --> 18:11.200
But a couple of your friends just thought
you might wanna talk about it, so...

18:12.840 --> 18:17.800
Just so you know. Can we get out of here?
Maybe go for a walk or something?

18:19.680 --> 18:22.440
Sure. You're the doctor.

18:23.680 --> 18:26.440
Right. Let's go.

18:31.840 --> 18:35.320
So how did Brae become your stepfather?

18:36.600 --> 18:38.880
Technically, l guess he isn't.

18:38.960 --> 18:43.760
l kinda just think of him that way.
He raised me after my father died.

18:43.880 --> 18:46.800
He did good. You got a good job.
You help people out.

18:46.920 --> 18:50.000
From what your friends tell me,
you're quite the hero.

18:50.120 --> 18:52.960
- That was just plain stupid.
- What was?

18:53.080 --> 18:55.560
What brought me here in the first place.

18:55.680 --> 19:00.200
We came on a crash site and
one of the drivers was hurt pretty bad.

19:00.280 --> 19:03.600
You thought he was Brae, your stepfather.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.960
Who told you that?

19:07.080 --> 19:12.400
Your friends care about you. That's why
they've asked me to see you. lt's good.

19:13.120 --> 19:16.880
You're giving up a part of yourself,
a vital part.

19:16.960 --> 19:19.400
And you're doing it out of love.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.680
- So?
- So? So maybe you're afraid.

19:25.280 --> 19:28.080
Maybe you're afraid that
you won't be yourself.

19:28.160 --> 19:31.120
The doctor said l would
lead a normal life afterwards.

19:31.200 --> 19:34.200
Self-preservation is a powerful instinct.

19:35.080 --> 19:38.440
Not afraid, Doc. Not one bit.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.560
That's quite a burden, all that denial.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.160
- l can't let you have the operation.
- No, you can't stop me.

19:44.240 --> 19:48.240
- Yes, l can, actually. And l will.
- Why?

19:48.360 --> 19:51.280
We don't destroy one man's life
to save another.

19:51.360 --> 19:56.080
Look at me, Doc. l'm the healthiest human
being you've ever seen. l'm 100 per cent.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.880
- l'm not just talking about your body.
- Then what?

19:59.000 --> 20:02.720
You've been having nightmares
almost every night, l've been told.

20:02.840 --> 20:05.040
- Big deal.
- And, and it's a big ''and'',

20:05.120 --> 20:10.080
yesterday you had an hallucination.
l'm sorry, but that is a big deal.

20:11.280 --> 20:14.400
All l'm saying is,
your life is as important as Brae's.

20:14.480 --> 20:18.960
So if you go through with this, you have
to accept what it's going to do to you.

20:19.080 --> 20:22.400
- l wanna save Brae.
- l know you do. l wanna help you do that.

20:22.480 --> 20:25.200
That is a promise.

20:25.320 --> 20:30.800
lf you know your way back, l have to go.
l'm late for another appointment, so...

20:33.160 --> 20:36.080
- ls my hour up already?
- No. Your 20 minutes are up.

20:36.200 --> 20:39.200
We'll work our way up to an hour.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.680
(Stargate alarm)

20:56.640 --> 21:00.800
Hey, let's go. You know how much
it costs to keep that thing on?

21:05.640 --> 21:07.600
l'm ready.

21:09.200 --> 21:11.560
Good. Let's move out.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.520
What's wrong with you?

21:15.640 --> 21:18.000
Nothing is wrong, O'Neill.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.360
l need you to focus.

21:25.440 --> 21:27.880
- l am ready.
- All right, then.

22:09.040 --> 22:11.480
You are afraid to die.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.040
No.

22:13.160 --> 22:16.400
Because you know l will be
waiting for you in the afterlife.

22:16.520 --> 22:19.920
- Who are you?
- You know who l am, Teal'c.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.800
l am your god.

22:23.360 --> 22:26.560
- No
- Excuse me, sir.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.640
Are you lost?

22:31.320 --> 22:33.520
No. l'm...

22:33.640 --> 22:37.760
- Are you sure you're all right?
- l'm fine.

22:37.840 --> 22:39.600
lt's...

22:45.720 --> 22:48.080
lt's the wrong room.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.040
Sorry.

22:59.760 --> 23:01.760
(nurse) Sir? Sir?

23:16.560 --> 23:19.600
You cannot escape your fate, shol'va.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.000
C'mon, let's go.

23:28.720 --> 23:33.680
You know how much it costs to keep that
thing open? Bra'tac's waiting for you.

23:39.160 --> 23:42.160
- Something is wrong.
- What is it?

23:45.040 --> 23:47.480
He must have taken it.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.240
Who must have taken what?

23:54.440 --> 23:56.560
Shut it down.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.760
Teal'c.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.480
- My symbiote is gone.
- Fraiser gave you a clean bill of health.

24:06.560 --> 24:09.360
My symbiote is gone
My symbiote is gone

24:09.480 --> 24:12.480
Get a medical team down here right now

24:14.760 --> 24:17.520
Help me. Help me.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.240
Hold on, old man.

24:53.080 --> 24:55.040
(symbiote screeches)

25:07.120 --> 25:09.560
Help me. Help me.

25:17.280 --> 25:19.640
(woman) lt's just a nightmare. You're safe.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.720
l was in the hospital.

25:26.840 --> 25:31.600
That's right. They performed
the transplant and you recovered.

25:31.680 --> 25:34.120
- They sent you home.
- What?

25:35.880 --> 25:39.360
- l don't remember.
- You saved his life.

25:39.480 --> 25:42.240
l don't remember coming home.

25:42.320 --> 25:45.840
But you are home... with me.

25:45.960 --> 25:48.720
And everything's all right.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.320
O'Neill...

26:02.400 --> 26:08.080
O'Neill picked me up...
and he took me home.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.000
That's right.

26:10.120 --> 26:13.520
Brae's gonna be fine. And so are you.

26:13.600 --> 26:15.880
lt's just a nightmare, my love.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
l feel like...

26:19.080 --> 26:22.560
Shauna, l feel like l'm going insane.

26:22.640 --> 26:27.040
- A few bad dreams...
- You can't tell anybody about this, OK?

26:27.120 --> 26:29.920
Cos l don't want people
to think l'm going crazy.

26:30.040 --> 26:32.000
l promise.

26:33.640 --> 26:37.600
When l'm there, this is the dream.

26:37.720 --> 26:41.280
- When you're there?
- l'm part of something.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.800
Military, or underground,
or a secret place.

26:44.880 --> 26:48.560
- Listen to what you're saying.
- l'm serious

26:48.680 --> 26:51.680
- lt's a dream.
- They say this is the dream.

26:51.760 --> 26:56.720
And when l'm there, l believe it. There,
it makes sense that this can't be real.

27:00.040 --> 27:02.400
And when l'm here...

27:06.240 --> 27:09.280
Honey... look at me.

27:11.160 --> 27:13.120
Look at me.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.800
Kiss me.

27:26.960 --> 27:29.520
How can that not be real?

27:59.240 --> 28:01.200
(knocks on door)

28:05.360 --> 28:08.640
- (Brae) How are you feeling?
- Better.

28:08.760 --> 28:10.720
And you?

28:15.840 --> 28:18.200
They haven't told you?

28:19.640 --> 28:22.720
They say my body's
rejecting the new kidney.

28:22.800 --> 28:23.680
What?

28:23.800 --> 28:27.920
They're pumping me full of antirejection
drugs - this, that, everything -

28:28.000 --> 28:30.800
but l gotta say...

28:34.600 --> 28:39.120
if it... if it doesn't take, l'm ready to go.

28:40.040 --> 28:42.400
l really am.

28:44.160 --> 28:48.880
How do you know this operation isn't
keeping me from going to a better place?

28:48.960 --> 28:51.920
Come on, Brae.
Don't even start talking like that.

28:53.280 --> 28:55.680
Why are we so afraid of dying?

28:59.840 --> 29:02.880
- l'm not afraid.
- l am

29:03.000 --> 29:05.280
OK?

29:05.360 --> 29:08.320
l'd rather die myself than let you go.

29:09.320 --> 29:14.080
So you hang in there. Because l did not go
through this so you could give up on me.

29:47.320 --> 29:51.280
Am l late? l thought
it was supposed to be at eleven.

29:51.360 --> 29:54.240
- lt is.
- Oh.

29:54.320 --> 29:56.680
Good.

29:56.800 --> 29:59.440
- Been up to see Brae?
- Just came from there.

29:59.560 --> 30:04.240
- How's he doing?
- His body is rejecting the new kidney.

30:09.360 --> 30:13.280
- You knew that might happen.
- There's gotta be something we can do.

30:13.360 --> 30:17.600
- You've done everything possible.
- l didn't go through this so Brae could die.

30:17.720 --> 30:22.000
Why are you going through this?
Why do you think this is happening?

30:23.000 --> 30:26.760
- l mean all of it. Brae, the nightmares...
- The nightmares are gone.

30:26.880 --> 30:32.320
You're not dreaming you're part of some
secret military operation underground?

30:35.480 --> 30:38.240
- Shauna told you.
- No.

30:38.360 --> 30:42.720
- Then how the hell do you know?
- l just... l know. lt doesn't matter.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.400
Fine. l'll ask her myself.

30:48.000 --> 30:53.200
Because we've talked about this before.
You just don't remember.

30:53.280 --> 30:57.680
Like you don't remember the operation or
getting discharged from hospital. Right?

30:57.800 --> 30:59.680
Right?

30:59.800 --> 31:02.240
Well, tell me about it again.

31:04.640 --> 31:07.920
- l'm part of something... a team.
- Who's on this team?

31:08.040 --> 31:12.800
Same as our fire hall - Chief O'Neill,
Captain Carter. Even Probie's there.

31:12.920 --> 31:15.760
- Probie is who?
- Probationary fireman.

31:15.880 --> 31:18.320
- lt's the same as a rookie.
- Right.

31:18.440 --> 31:20.160
His name's Jonas.

31:20.280 --> 31:25.200
And what does this team do,
the one in your dream?

31:25.320 --> 31:30.320
Go places, you know?
Try to make a difference, to help people.

31:30.400 --> 31:32.400
You're firemen.

31:33.400 --> 31:34.960
No.

31:35.080 --> 31:36.880
We, um...

31:38.480 --> 31:41.440
You're just gonna have to trust me.

31:42.920 --> 31:45.440
All right.

31:45.520 --> 31:47.760
We go to other planets,

31:47.880 --> 31:51.920
through a big ring
of shimmering blue water.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.960
Ah, l'm not even human.

31:55.040 --> 31:58.240
- So you're a...
- A Jaffa.

31:58.320 --> 32:03.840
l carry this thing around in my gut that's
called a symbiote. Helps keep me alive.

32:03.960 --> 32:08.080
Something like a kidney. Something
you might be hesitant to give up?

32:08.160 --> 32:12.640
Let me ask you this -
does Brae fit anywhere into your dream?

32:13.760 --> 32:16.880
Which one? l don't even know
what's real any more.

32:16.960 --> 32:22.400
You're not alone. Philosophers have been
trying to figure that out for a long time.

32:22.520 --> 32:25.520
So let me just get this straight.

32:27.720 --> 32:32.240
When you're there, this is the dream.
And when you're here, that's the dream.

32:32.320 --> 32:35.440
- They're both so real.
- ln both you have nightmares.

32:35.520 --> 32:39.360
- l'm not meant to dream in the other one.
- Because you're Jaffa?

32:39.480 --> 32:41.520
Don't ask me. l...

32:41.600 --> 32:46.000
That's really neither here nor there.
The point is, both can't be real.

32:49.280 --> 32:50.880
No.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.320
So you're trying to figure out
which of the lives is real,

32:54.400 --> 32:58.800
so that you can stay there, or here
or wherever it is you're supposed to be,

32:58.920 --> 33:00.960
once and for all.

33:01.040 --> 33:06.240
Maybe the answer to that question is
something you haven't even considered.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.800
Maybe neither one is real.

33:10.520 --> 33:12.960
- What?
- Think about it.

33:14.200 --> 33:17.800
lf you can't distinguish between them,

33:17.920 --> 33:21.280
if the one seems equally
as real as the other,

33:22.320 --> 33:25.440
maybe you don't belong in either one.

33:31.160 --> 33:33.520
Then what do l do?

33:35.800 --> 33:39.560
Hang in there... just a little while longer.

33:47.520 --> 33:50.000
You can't leave me here like this.

33:50.120 --> 33:54.240
l haven't left your side, Teal'c.
l'm not going to.

33:55.920 --> 33:57.920
That's a promise.

34:05.760 --> 34:08.159
- O'Neill.
- (Dr Fraiser) lt's OK.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.840
You're gonna be all right.
Just hang in there.

34:10.920 --> 34:15.639
Teal'c, listen. This is important. How long
have you gone without your symbiote?

34:15.719 --> 34:19.040
- Bra'tac.
- He's alive. But l need to know how long.

34:19.159 --> 34:21.920
- You must save Bra'tac
- We'll do our best.

34:22.040 --> 34:25.800
Let's take them both directly
to OR one. Let's move.

34:25.920 --> 34:27.679
Easy.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.480
- What happened, Colonel?
- lt was a setup from the get-go.

34:38.600 --> 34:42.880
- The meeting of the rebel leaders?
- lt was no meeting. lt was an ambush.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.360
We found over 100 rebel Jaffa dead.

34:45.440 --> 34:48.400
Every one had had their symbiotes
removed, except one.

34:48.520 --> 34:51.199
- Bra'tac.
- Only he and Teal'c were left alive.

34:51.280 --> 34:55.679
Teal'c left over three days ago. How did
he survive that long without his symbiote?

34:55.800 --> 34:58.160
Teal'c survived the ambush,

34:58.280 --> 35:01.680
then used his own symbiote
to keep both he and Bra'tac alive.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.760
He knew we'd show up when he was late.

35:03.880 --> 35:07.440
How long can two Jaffas survive
with only one symbiote?

35:07.560 --> 35:12.000
We have no idea. Until a couple of hours
ago we didn't even think it was possible.

35:12.120 --> 35:14.480
Report to the briefing room in one hour.

35:14.600 --> 35:16.560
Yes, sir.

35:25.200 --> 35:28.960
We've stabilised them by using
the same method Teal'c must have used,

35:29.080 --> 35:31.040
otherwise he would have been dead.

35:31.160 --> 35:34.160
We're transferring the symbiote
from one to the other.

35:34.280 --> 35:37.200
- How long can you keep them both alive?
- l don't know.

35:37.320 --> 35:39.200
lt's a miracle they've survived.

35:39.320 --> 35:42.120
Don't ask me how Teal'c
had the strength to keep it up.

35:42.240 --> 35:45.600
Dr Fraiser, why can't we just
get him another symbiote?

35:45.680 --> 35:47.440
We've looked into it.

35:47.560 --> 35:51.040
lt's impossible to find
a symbiote that isn't being used.

35:51.120 --> 35:52.320
Right.

35:52.400 --> 35:56.320
We contacted the Tok'ra when we
received your emergency transmission

35:56.400 --> 36:00.480
and apprised them of Teal'c and Bra'tac's
condition. Jacob is on the way.

36:00.600 --> 36:02.120
lf it comes to a choice...

36:02.200 --> 36:05.520
We have to consider that
Teal'c has already made a choice.

36:05.600 --> 36:10.120
According to Dr Fraiser, he's gone
through hell in order to see it through.

36:11.160 --> 36:14.120
Let's hope it doesn't come down to that.

36:20.600 --> 36:25.360
- Dad, thank God you're here.
- Hopefully l'm not too late.

36:29.480 --> 36:31.200
How are they?

36:31.280 --> 36:33.040
Shauna...

36:34.240 --> 36:36.000
''Shauna''?

36:37.720 --> 36:40.720
Shan'auc. She was
very important in Teal'c's life.

36:40.840 --> 36:44.120
When a Jaffa goes without
his symbiote for any length of time,

36:44.200 --> 36:48.640
at least according to Jaffa legend,
his life flashes before his eyes.

36:49.400 --> 36:52.160
lt might help if you talk to him.

36:53.560 --> 36:55.520
Yeah. Uh...

36:57.640 --> 37:01.120
Teal'c, you gotta hang in there.

37:01.200 --> 37:03.280
l need you.

37:03.400 --> 37:06.360
You made me feel like one of the team.

37:07.200 --> 37:10.000
lf there's anything l can do...

37:11.320 --> 37:14.880
Don't worry about it, Probie.
Go back to sleep.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.200
''Probie''?

37:20.760 --> 37:22.720
Dr Fraiser.

37:23.920 --> 37:27.440
- What's their condition?
- Critical. All three of them.

37:27.560 --> 37:28.960
Three?

37:29.040 --> 37:33.440
Due to his age and the fact that his body
shows signs of rejecting the symbiote,

37:33.520 --> 37:39.120
Bra'tac has had it longer than Teal'c.
The strain is too much for the symbiote.

37:39.200 --> 37:43.280
l don't think it could restore
either one of them at this point.

37:46.240 --> 37:49.600
- What about a hand device?
- l brought something better.

37:49.680 --> 37:54.520
Something that should work as effectively
as a symbiote, at least for the short term.

37:54.640 --> 37:57.000
- What's that?
- Tretonin, sir.

37:59.520 --> 38:05.200
- The drug the Pangarans offered us?
- Whoa That's ground Goa'uld, isn't it?

38:05.280 --> 38:09.920
lt's a little more refined than that, but
yes, it is derived from Goa'uld symbiotes.

38:10.040 --> 38:13.760
lt supplanted the immune systems
in the Pangarans. Why not for the Jaffa?

38:13.880 --> 38:18.800
lt won't work. lt was designed to take
the place of a human immune system.

38:18.880 --> 38:22.480
We've since refined it
specifically for Jaffa physiology.

38:22.600 --> 38:27.280
The Tok'ra have wanted an end to Jaffa
dependence on symbiotes for centuries.

38:27.400 --> 38:32.480
We've worked on this tretonin variant
since you introduced us to the Pangarans.

38:32.560 --> 38:35.680
- But it hasn't been tested.
- But even if it does work,

38:35.800 --> 38:39.840
Teal'c and Bra'tac will be as dependent
on the tretonin as the Pangarans.

38:39.920 --> 38:43.120
Given time, we can solve that problem.

38:44.680 --> 38:48.880
- But at least they'll be alive.
- lf l knew that this is what Teal'c wanted...

38:49.000 --> 38:54.400
Janet, this could lead to freedom
from Goa'uld oppression for all Jaffa.

38:54.520 --> 38:59.360
That's something Teal'c and Bra'tac
want more than anything.

39:00.640 --> 39:03.880
- Do it.
- Yes, sir.

39:10.440 --> 39:14.960
Teal'c without Junior... that's a concept.

39:32.880 --> 39:35.360
Hey, Teal'c.

39:35.480 --> 39:39.440
- Am l dreaming?
- No, not this time.

39:40.640 --> 39:44.720
lt's late. Everyone's gone home.
l just wanted to make sure you were OK.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.760
- What of Bra'tac?
- Bra'tac's fine.

39:49.280 --> 39:52.560
- Thanks to you.
- And to you as well, l believe.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.920
No. No, that was you.

39:55.040 --> 39:57.920
l don't know anyone that
could have done what you did.

39:58.040 --> 40:02.640
You kept him alive for three days
without ever thinking about yourself.

40:02.720 --> 40:07.120
Every time you gave up your symbiote
you knew it might be for the last time.

40:07.240 --> 40:11.520
This experience has been
very different for me.

40:11.600 --> 40:14.480
lt seemed... so real.

40:14.600 --> 40:18.960
Your mind took you where it needed to go
to get you through this.

40:19.080 --> 40:21.880
l promise you, this is real.

40:22.880 --> 40:25.440
You're just gonna have to trust me on that.

40:28.280 --> 40:30.240
Go to sleep.

40:30.320 --> 40:34.240
When you wake up,
everything is gonna be fine.

40:35.640 --> 40:39.040
ls that a promise, Daniel Jackson?

40:39.120 --> 40:41.120
That's a promise.
