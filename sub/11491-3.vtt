00:02.910 --> 00:05.774
I said no.
And I say, why not?

00:05.942 --> 00:08.170
- Why not?
I don't have to give you a reason.

00:08.376 --> 00:11.239
Dad, I got my learner's permit
but Mom won't let me drive.

00:11.409 --> 00:14.897
Just because they give 15-year-olds permits
doesn't mean they're ready.

00:15.075 --> 00:16.734
I've been driving for years.

00:16.907 --> 00:19.430
"Grand Theft Auto 1,"
"Grand Theft Auto 2."

00:20.740 --> 00:23.331
I never ran over anybody
but pimps and crack whores.

00:23.507 --> 00:26.563
- Jake.
- Sorry, crack prostitutes.

00:27.572 --> 00:29.060
Go get started on your homework.

00:29.239 --> 00:31.466
- After, will you take me driving?
- We'll talk.

00:31.638 --> 00:32.831
- When?
- Go to your room.

00:33.005 --> 00:35.402
- I'm available now.
- Go.

00:35.571 --> 00:39.593
Man, if I knew how to hot-wire a real car,
I'd be so out of here.

00:40.604 --> 00:44.296
- Thanks for bringing him by, I guess.
- Lf you need to reach me, Herb and I...

00:44.469 --> 00:46.900
...are going to Laguna Beach
for a weekend getaway.

00:47.102 --> 00:50.090
- How nice. Taking the baby?
- Are you insane? I said "getaway."

00:50.268 --> 00:51.666
Herb's lucky I'm taking him.

00:52.402 --> 00:55.925
- I see. So who's watching little Millie?
- My mother.

00:56.100 --> 01:00.555
- Ooh. Are we sure that's a good idea?
- Okay, first of all, there is no we here.

01:00.733 --> 01:01.926
And what are you implying?

01:02.099 --> 01:05.327
That there might be better choices
for a babysitter than a woman...

01:05.498 --> 01:08.727
...who has a sandwich named after her
at the Betty Ford clinic.

01:10.598 --> 01:13.758
She's three years clean and sober,
all the charges were dropped...

01:13.930 --> 01:16.396
...and she's great with Millie.
- All right.

01:16.563 --> 01:19.222
I gave her your number,
in case there's an emergency.

01:19.397 --> 01:22.124
I don't mind. So how is the baby anyway?

01:23.096 --> 01:24.561
- Fine.
- Good, good.

01:24.729 --> 01:26.558
Jake showed me some pictures.

01:26.728 --> 01:28.956
I gotta say,
she doesn't look much like you...

01:29.129 --> 01:30.991
...and she doesn't look like Herb.

01:31.161 --> 01:32.786
Don't go there, Alan.

01:32.961 --> 01:35.791
Go where? I'm not implying that
someone other than Herb...

01:35.961 --> 01:38.426
...could be the father,
even though that someone...

01:38.593 --> 01:42.423
...did have unprotected sex with you
nine months before the birth of a child...

01:42.593 --> 01:45.150
...that looks suspiciously
like that someone.

01:46.092 --> 01:48.148
You get that I'm talking about me, right?

01:48.325 --> 01:50.756
If we wanna beat the traffic,
we should get going.

01:50.924 --> 01:51.947
- Hey, Alan.
- Hey, Herb.

01:52.125 --> 01:55.556
You hear? Judith and I are spending
a romantic weekend in Laguna.

01:55.723 --> 01:57.780
I said weekend, Herb. That's all.

01:57.957 --> 02:00.786
Okay, fine, no romance.

02:00.956 --> 02:02.945
But sex is still on the table, right?

02:03.123 --> 02:05.111
- Just get in the car.
- Oh, can I drive?

02:05.288 --> 02:07.220
- No.
- Why not?

02:09.122 --> 02:10.747
Is she gone?

02:13.388 --> 02:14.853
Damn it!

02:17.153 --> 02:19.210
Chelsea, your cat's trying to kill me.

02:19.386 --> 02:21.750
Is he okay?
- The cat's fine.

02:21.918 --> 02:25.748
Probably off plotting his next mo...
Whoa. Whoa!

02:25.918 --> 02:27.940
- Are you okay?
- No.

02:28.717 --> 02:30.377
- What happened?
- Uncle Charlie fell.

02:30.550 --> 02:31.777
Oh.

02:31.951 --> 02:33.973
Can I drive you to the hospital?

02:35.000 --> 02:41.074

03:03.811 --> 03:05.777
Mr. Lancelot!

03:07.678 --> 03:09.836
Here, kitty, kitty!

03:12.076 --> 03:14.735
He's probably hiding
because he thinks you're mad at him.

03:16.110 --> 03:19.667
For God's sake, the cat doesn't think
anything except maybe:

03:19.842 --> 03:21.603
"Mm, fish, I'll eat it."

03:23.075 --> 03:26.097
Or, "Ooh, sand, I'll crap in it."

03:26.774 --> 03:29.797
You're wrong.
He's very intelligent and very intuitive.

03:29.973 --> 03:33.996
- He knows you resent him living here.
- Thank you, but I can defend myself.

03:36.406 --> 03:37.769
I was talking about my cat.

03:37.939 --> 03:41.268
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Mm, fish, yum.

03:43.438 --> 03:47.926
- Okay, I'm going to work. Feel better.
- Thanks.

03:48.104 --> 03:49.331
How's the shoulder?

03:51.070 --> 03:52.558
Oh, the shoulder's fine.

03:52.737 --> 03:55.668
I'm just hoping to get a little
"Oh, poor Charlie" tonight.

03:55.836 --> 04:01.234
- "Oh, poor Charlie?"
- Yeah. You know, "Oh, poor Charlie.

04:01.401 --> 04:04.663
I feel bad about your shoulder,
so you just lie still...

04:04.834 --> 04:07.823
...while I provide you
with a series of intense orgasms."

04:09.400 --> 04:12.991
Wow. I don't know what to say,
other than "oink."

04:14.899 --> 04:16.454
Is that a car? Can I drive?

04:16.632 --> 04:18.358
Relax, it was just Chelsea going to work.

04:18.531 --> 04:20.793
Oh. Uncle Charlie,
you need to go anywhere?

04:20.964 --> 04:24.418
- Yeah, away from you.
- All right. I'll drive you.

04:25.597 --> 04:28.290
You wanna drive my $80,000 Mercedes?

04:28.464 --> 04:30.157
Yes, please.

04:30.329 --> 04:34.125
It's good that he's polite.
It's a necessary quality in a doorman.

04:35.628 --> 04:38.423
- Was that a yes or a no?
- That was a no.

04:38.595 --> 04:41.617
- So the doorman thing was an insult?
- Yes.

04:42.028 --> 04:43.118
Oh.

04:45.626 --> 04:46.785
And a prophecy.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.315
Hello?

04:53.525 --> 04:55.820
No, it's Charlie. Who's this?

04:56.459 --> 04:58.481
I can't hear you, what?

04:59.858 --> 05:00.881
- Alan, it's for you.
- Oh.

05:02.824 --> 05:07.449
Hello? Oh. Oh, hi, Lenore.
It's Judith's mother.

05:07.623 --> 05:10.315
Is that the house alarm?

05:10.522 --> 05:12.919
Is the baby okay?

05:14.089 --> 05:16.919
All right, open the little panel
by the front door...

05:17.088 --> 05:20.418
...and enter pound, star and the code.

05:22.088 --> 05:24.315
Pound is the little tic-tac-toe board.

05:25.987 --> 05:29.282
<i>Yeah, like on Hollywood Squares.</i>

05:30.086 --> 05:32.449
- She still popping the pain pills?
- No.

05:32.618 --> 05:34.811
Good. See if she's got any leftovers.

05:36.151 --> 05:39.140
Okay, the code is Jake's birthday.

05:40.384 --> 05:42.611
Your grandson.

05:43.250 --> 05:47.409
Anyway, it's 0314. Oh.
No, Lenore, don't punch it into the phone.

05:47.583 --> 05:50.242
No, Lenore! Lenore! Lenore.
Okay, okay, okay. Calm down.

05:50.415 --> 05:53.869
Calm down. I'll be right there.
I will turn it off for you.

05:54.048 --> 05:57.275
Okay, okay. Bye. Ugh. I gotta go.

05:57.448 --> 06:01.107
You couldn't be more of a sucker
if you were on the end of a stick.

06:01.281 --> 06:04.610
Why? Because I'll take any excuse
to spend time with my daughter?

06:04.779 --> 06:07.870
- You don't know you're the father.
- Oh, come on.

06:08.046 --> 06:10.534
She's got my jaw line, my eyes, my ears.

06:10.712 --> 06:13.473
You left out thinning hair
and poopy pants.

06:14.911 --> 06:18.036
That was one time
and I begged you to stop at a gas station.

06:24.810 --> 06:27.275
Oh, Alan, thank God you're here.

06:27.443 --> 06:30.533
I pushed all the buttons,
but I can't get it to stop.

06:30.709 --> 06:34.800
That might be because you were
adjusting the thermostat.

06:38.940 --> 06:42.100
- Ah. There we go.
- Oh, thank God.

06:42.273 --> 06:46.069
Oh, here, let me see if I can turn
this alarm off, ha, ha. Come here, Millie.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.363
Come to Papa.

06:50.871 --> 06:54.234
<i>Was a rolling stone</i>

06:54.404 --> 06:58.597
<i>Wherever he laid his hat was his home</i>

06:58.770 --> 07:02.429
Always sang this to Jake.
Worked like a charm.

07:03.136 --> 07:06.033
<i>And when he died</i>

07:06.202 --> 07:09.225
<i>All he left us was alone</i>

07:10.735 --> 07:14.632
- Huh. Look at that.
- Well, you are a miracle worker, Alan.

07:14.801 --> 07:18.789
Oh, no. I just have a knack for babies.
And animals.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.898
It's only English-speaking adults
that don't like me.

07:22.499 --> 07:24.794
Well, I think you're a wonderful fellow.

07:24.999 --> 07:28.556
And if you don't mind my saying,
Judith was a fool to let you go.

07:28.732 --> 07:31.856
Eh. She didn't so much let me go
as drop me from an airplane...

07:32.031 --> 07:34.223
...with an anvil necklace.

07:35.364 --> 07:38.057
Okay, honey,
time to get your beauty rest.

07:38.230 --> 07:42.355
I'm afraid that's gonna have
to be a long nap.

07:42.529 --> 07:44.552
I hate to say it about my granddaughter...

07:44.729 --> 07:49.922
...but let's face it, with those big ears,
she looks a little like a fruit bat.

07:52.094 --> 07:54.026
I think her ears are the perfect size.

07:54.894 --> 07:55.951
You would.

07:57.226 --> 08:01.715
- How about some wine?
- Uh... Thank you, but I should get going.

08:01.893 --> 08:05.188
Oh, no, come on. Join me.
Just one. We'll catch up.

08:05.359 --> 08:09.415
Uh, it's none of my business,
but do you think you should be drinking?

08:10.425 --> 08:13.288
- Because I've been to Betty Ford?
- Oh, no.

08:13.490 --> 08:16.285
Because you got kicked out of Betty Ford.

08:16.457 --> 08:18.217
Hey, Britney bit me first.

08:20.222 --> 08:23.415
Anyway, I was there for pills.

08:23.588 --> 08:26.577
I've never had a problem with alcohol.

08:31.387 --> 08:33.852
See? No problem.

08:34.287 --> 08:36.582
Okay, now...

08:36.753 --> 08:41.514
...where did I hide those muscle relaxers
I picked up in Mexico?

08:44.985 --> 08:48.439
That's right, between my butt cheeks.

08:51.417 --> 08:52.883
Turn around.

09:07.315 --> 09:08.338
Uncle Charlie?

09:08.514 --> 09:10.912
- What?
- You hungry?

09:12.780 --> 09:15.940
Because if you are,
we could go get something to eat.

09:16.112 --> 09:17.771
And I'll even drive.

09:18.679 --> 09:21.873
- Jake, I'm sleeping.
- Okay.

09:25.544 --> 09:27.442
You know, you can nap in the car.

09:27.611 --> 09:30.940
I just gotta have an adult with me.
They don't have to be conscious.

09:31.677 --> 09:35.165
- I'm not hungry.
- Okay, fine.

09:38.542 --> 09:41.167
You wanna go see a movie?
Because if you do...

09:43.408 --> 09:45.169
Maybe after your nap.

09:49.974 --> 09:55.837
- Oh, crap, now I'm awake.
- Great. You hungry?

09:58.539 --> 10:01.333
You're lucky you're single, Alan.

10:01.505 --> 10:04.062
- Oh, I don't know.
- Oh, no, trust me.

10:04.238 --> 10:07.431
I've been married for 39 years.

10:09.903 --> 10:12.062
Really? But Judith's 40.

10:12.236 --> 10:14.065
Shh.

10:16.102 --> 10:20.897
Do you know what it's like to wake up
every morning, year after year...

10:21.068 --> 10:25.557
...and see the same stupid face
lying next to you?

10:26.733 --> 10:30.096
Uh, well, all I can tell you
is what I told your daughter.

10:30.266 --> 10:33.061
If you don't like it, roll over.

10:37.065 --> 10:39.895
Fred hasn't touched me in 14 years.

10:40.065 --> 10:44.587
Uh, well, in his defense,
he did have that stroke.

10:45.430 --> 10:48.487
Do you know what happens
to a woman's body...

10:48.664 --> 10:50.720
...when it goes unloved for that long?

10:50.896 --> 10:54.055
Lenore, I don't feel comfortable
talking about this with you.

10:54.229 --> 10:56.524
Oh, now, Alan, come on.
We're both grown-ups.

10:56.695 --> 10:59.661
Think about what I am saying.

11:02.861 --> 11:04.724
All right? Well...

11:06.494 --> 11:11.891
<i>I'm getting an image of a cave
from an Indiana Jones movie.</i>

11:12.659 --> 11:13.682
What?

11:14.659 --> 11:18.216
Well, you know, cobwebs...

11:18.658 --> 11:20.749
...dust...

11:20.958 --> 11:22.820
...human skulls.

11:23.457 --> 11:26.889
This is my vagina we're talking about.

11:27.056 --> 11:30.318
Oh, I am well aware
of what we're talking about.

11:32.056 --> 11:34.680
I've been so alone.

11:35.188 --> 11:37.983
Oh. Oh. I'm...

11:38.254 --> 11:40.015
I'm sorry, Lenore.

11:55.051 --> 11:56.880
A stroke's starting to look pretty good.

12:03.350 --> 12:05.975
- Can't I at least back it out?
- No.

12:06.149 --> 12:08.012
Come on, nothing's gonna happen.

12:09.383 --> 12:11.280
- Look, you wanna go eat or not?
- Fine.

12:11.448 --> 12:13.811
If we went to an empty parking lot,
could I drive?

12:13.981 --> 12:15.311
How many times I gotta tell you...?

12:20.613 --> 12:23.841
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

12:24.013 --> 12:25.536
Sounds like you ran over a cat.

12:35.077 --> 12:36.940
Told you you should have let me drive.

12:39.310 --> 12:41.742
You know,
Chelsea's gonna completely freak out.

12:41.910 --> 12:44.967
No, she will not be happy.

12:46.409 --> 12:49.636
- Doesn't even look like a cat anymore.
- Nope.

12:49.808 --> 12:53.467
More like a cat pancake. "Catcake."

12:54.974 --> 12:56.633
Sorry.

12:56.807 --> 13:00.204
- What am I gonna tell her?
- She doesn't have to know.

13:00.840 --> 13:02.033
You're right.

13:02.207 --> 13:04.899
She thinks Sir Lancelot's missing,
so he stays missing.

13:05.072 --> 13:07.697
Sir Squished-a-Lot.

13:07.872 --> 13:09.531
Let's think what we've gotta do.

13:09.705 --> 13:12.227
We have to get rid of the body,
clean up the mess...

13:12.405 --> 13:15.268
...then act like nothing's happened.
- Good plan. Except.

13:15.437 --> 13:17.232
- Except what?
- Say cheese.

13:17.737 --> 13:18.828
What are you doing?

13:19.004 --> 13:22.060
Making sure I get to drive your car
whenever I want to.

13:22.669 --> 13:26.066
- What? Give me that.
- Too late. I emailed it to myself.

13:26.235 --> 13:28.326
- You're bluffing.
- Perhaps.

13:28.502 --> 13:31.558
But can you really afford
to take that chance?

13:35.368 --> 13:39.026
<i>Hush, little baby, don't say a word</i>

13:39.200 --> 13:42.723
<i>Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird</i>

13:42.900 --> 13:45.365
<i>If that mockingbird don't sing</i>

13:45.532 --> 13:48.089
Forget it, I'm not sleepy.

13:49.864 --> 13:51.387
Let's go in the hot tub.

13:52.398 --> 13:54.693
But I don't have a bathing suit.

13:55.297 --> 13:57.388
Me neither.

13:59.529 --> 14:01.790
Come on, stroke.

14:05.896 --> 14:08.361
Judith, ah. This just keeps getting better.

14:10.327 --> 14:13.759
Oh, hey, look who's up. Hi, sweetie.

14:13.927 --> 14:17.052
You need a change? Oh, yeah.

14:17.226 --> 14:19.851
I'll let you in on a little secret.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.355
Before this day is over...

14:21.525 --> 14:24.888
...I might need to change my undies too.

14:30.458 --> 14:31.718
Uh-oh.

14:31.891 --> 14:33.379
It's your Mommy again.

14:34.323 --> 14:35.516
Shh.

14:36.056 --> 14:37.181
Hello?

14:37.357 --> 14:39.345
Oh, hey, Judith. What's up?

14:39.522 --> 14:41.953
- So how's Laguna?
- Laguna's fine.

14:42.122 --> 14:44.088
Um, my mother's
not answering the phone.

14:44.288 --> 14:46.277
I need you to go check on her
and the baby.

14:46.455 --> 14:50.477
Me? You want me to drive all the way
to Sherman Oaks...

14:50.654 --> 14:54.279
...to check on your mother,
who you assured me was clean and sober?

14:57.020 --> 14:58.212
What's that?

14:58.386 --> 15:02.079
Uh, that is TV that I am watching.

15:02.685 --> 15:05.207
The baby channel.

15:05.385 --> 15:07.850
A documentary about obese babies.

15:08.018 --> 15:09.779
Tragic.

15:11.184 --> 15:15.673
I will check up on your mother for you,
but you owe me one.

15:15.849 --> 15:17.712
Oh, Alan.

15:17.883 --> 15:19.508
Ta-da.

15:23.848 --> 15:24.939
Not bad.

15:25.915 --> 15:27.244
What's not bad?

15:27.414 --> 15:31.539
I mean, it's not a bad idea
for me to check up on her.

15:31.714 --> 15:34.736
Thank you. Call me when you get there.

15:34.913 --> 15:37.344
Oh, Judith.

15:38.412 --> 15:40.843
Look who mowed the front lawn.

15:46.178 --> 15:49.234
So we're agreed,
we will never speak of this again.

15:49.410 --> 15:52.375
Well, that kind of depends on you,
doesn't it?

15:53.010 --> 15:56.907
I've already got the shovel, Jake.
I can dig another hole.

15:57.508 --> 15:59.269
Charlie, I'm home.

16:02.774 --> 16:04.706
Hey, sweetie, how was work?

16:04.875 --> 16:07.669
Okay. I was worried about Sir Lancelot.
Have you seen him?

16:07.840 --> 16:10.102
No, haven't seen him. Not a trace.

16:10.974 --> 16:11.996
What about you, Jake?

16:12.173 --> 16:14.536
No. But if I was a cat,
I'd be out on the beach.

16:14.706 --> 16:18.160
Because the beach is one big litter box
and the ocean is a giant fish bowl.

16:18.339 --> 16:20.271
Like having a sushi bar in your bathroom.

16:22.071 --> 16:24.503
Wow, how great would that be?

16:25.137 --> 16:28.193
I guess. I'll still feel better
when he comes back.

16:28.370 --> 16:30.131
We all will.

16:32.003 --> 16:36.401
- You're quite the little liar, aren't you?
- I'm 15. My life depends on it.

16:36.568 --> 16:38.625
Chelsea, Charlie's gonna take me driving.

16:38.802 --> 16:42.165
- Can we bring you back anything?
No, thanks.

16:48.766 --> 16:50.993
That woman just cut you off.

16:51.700 --> 16:55.029
Learn how to drive, you whore!

16:55.199 --> 16:57.528
Yeah, I'm talking to you!

16:57.699 --> 17:00.028
Lenore, we should probably keep it down.

17:00.198 --> 17:02.254
- We don't wanna wake the baby.
- What baby?

17:02.865 --> 17:04.853
Oh, right.

17:05.030 --> 17:06.928
Woof.

17:13.063 --> 17:15.493
Hello, Judith.

17:15.661 --> 17:18.593
I was about to call you.
The baby's fine, nothing to worry about.

17:18.761 --> 17:21.851
Hey, Judy, Judy, Judy!

17:22.294 --> 17:24.259
Yeah, yeah. That's her.

17:24.426 --> 17:26.722
Uh-huh. Blotto.

17:26.893 --> 17:30.053
Uh, no. No need to rush home.
Everything's under control.

17:30.259 --> 17:32.850
We're in the car,
Millie's sleeping in the back seat...

17:33.025 --> 17:34.718
...and we're heading for Malibu.

17:36.025 --> 17:37.922
Ehab-ray.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.547
Ehab-ray?

17:41.290 --> 17:45.745
You said you were taking me
for crab cakes at Gladstone's.

17:45.923 --> 17:49.286
Well, I'm sorry,
but you just don't have a choice here.

17:49.456 --> 17:53.353
- The hell I don't.
- Lenore! Lenore! Lenore!

17:53.522 --> 17:56.147
Red light. Slow down, slow down, stop!

17:58.888 --> 18:01.876
You're making me really nervous,
you know that?

18:10.252 --> 18:13.082
Hey, you mind
getting me another grape soda?

18:13.252 --> 18:17.047
- Yeah, I mind. Get it yourself.
- Fine.

18:17.218 --> 18:20.706
I just have to send this JPEG
to Chelsea real fast.

18:22.083 --> 18:24.106
Okay, okay.

18:24.749 --> 18:27.374
- Look who finally came home.
- Who?

18:28.316 --> 18:32.270
Sir Lancelot. You've been a bad kitty cat.

18:32.448 --> 18:35.641
I've been so worried about you.

18:38.514 --> 18:40.343
Okay, I'm confused.

18:40.514 --> 18:43.741
If that's Sir Lancelot,
then what did we squash?

18:43.913 --> 18:47.174
Your hope of ever getting behind
the wheel of my car again.

18:48.846 --> 18:50.175
Oh, man.

18:52.945 --> 18:55.911
Leverage is a fickle bitch, my friend.

18:58.543 --> 19:00.338
I got it.

19:04.542 --> 19:06.337
- Can I help you?
- Sorry to bother you.

19:06.509 --> 19:09.202
I live down the beach
and I'm looking for my cat.

19:10.008 --> 19:13.996
I'm sorry, I haven't seen it.
In fact, I just found my little guy.

19:14.874 --> 19:16.806
I'm really worried.

19:17.874 --> 19:19.998
He's black and white, about yay big.

19:20.173 --> 19:21.502
Answers to Puss-Puss.

19:22.173 --> 19:23.866
I'll keep an eye out for him.

19:24.040 --> 19:26.800
Looks like the fickle bitch is back.

19:27.305 --> 19:33.302
