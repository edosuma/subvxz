00:01.359 --> 00:04.511
- Welcome to the dungeon.
- Why do the FBI stick their morgues

00:04.600 --> 00:06.556
in the most depressing basement?

00:06.640 --> 00:11.509
Don't be such a snob. Not everyone gets to
play in a million-dollar lab with skylights.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.797
It's because as a society we
feeI the need to hide death away

00:14.880 --> 00:18.316
and people who deaI with the
dead are viewed as freaks.

00:18.400 --> 00:21.392
This guy you're about to meet,
Harry, he's a bit twisted.

00:21.480 --> 00:24.597
You think I get a rush when
I work, that I'm titillated.

00:24.680 --> 00:26.989
Choice of words, Bones. Choice of words.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.990
- Agent Booth.
- Harry Tepper, meet Dr Temperance Brennan.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.877
- I've read her.
- Hello.

00:35.960 --> 00:41.557
She's good. Read your noveI too.
The heroine's very aggressive.

00:41.640 --> 00:43.596
Harry. You wanna...?

00:46.760 --> 00:50.150
OK, everybody, meet Ted Macy.
Body was found in a nationaI park.

00:50.240 --> 00:52.834
Coroner wrote it off as
an accidentaI drowning,

00:52.920 --> 00:55.639
but we must investigate
every death on federaI land.

00:55.720 --> 01:00.555
During my examination, I found he had a
crushed larynx that didn't seem accidentaI.

01:00.640 --> 01:03.996
- This is a corpse. With skin.
- She is good.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.196
Why am I here? I don't work with skin.

01:06.280 --> 01:10.910
I didn't bring you here to examine the body.
I want you to see what they found in his hand.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.558
Harry?

01:12.640 --> 01:14.631
Bone?

01:18.600 --> 01:21.558
- What is that?
- It's a phalanx.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.835
Finger bone. Figured she'd know that.

01:23.920 --> 01:27.754
I'd figure any medicaI examiner
would know not to compromise evidence.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.991
- Is this LysoI IC?
- We use it to decontaminate remains.

01:31.080 --> 01:35.517
Are you trying to break down the surface
of the bone? Wreak havoc on the marrow?

01:35.600 --> 01:37.556
- Did you even dilute this?
- Bones!

01:37.640 --> 01:42.839
What? You've removed particulates and trace
elements that could lead us to his killer.

01:42.920 --> 01:46.435
- Is this your first day on the job?
- 18 years next month.

01:48.360 --> 01:51.272
<i>18 years.</i>

01:51.360 --> 01:53.749
<i>She's intense.</i>

01:56.880 --> 01:59.189
- Native American.
- British coloniaI.

01:59.280 --> 02:01.714
- American revolutionary.
- What are we playing?

02:01.800 --> 02:04.394
Dr Brennan, the destroyer
of evidence is here.

02:04.480 --> 02:08.029
OK, I assume that's ajoke. Did
Harry really mess up that bone?

02:08.120 --> 02:10.714
He dissolved any
particulates on the surface.

02:10.800 --> 02:14.554
- But we were able to save valuable attributes.
- Like what?

02:14.640 --> 02:18.599
Alternating sclerotic and porotic
areas on subperiosteaI surface

02:18.680 --> 02:22.992
demonstrates that whoever this was
suffered from tertiary syphilis.

02:23.080 --> 02:26.072
Tertiary syphilis?
Wow, that's the worst.

02:26.160 --> 02:28.469
It was a common ailment
in the 17th century.

02:28.560 --> 02:31.711
- Which is where the bone dates from.
- Say what?

02:31.800 --> 02:35.839
We ran a radio carbon dating test.
The finger's over 300 years old.

02:35.920 --> 02:38.992
<i>- A unique find.
- I'll change to French trapper.</i>

02:39.080 --> 02:42.550
- You can't change yours.
- Booth, where did they find the victim?

02:42.640 --> 02:47.350
Some resort town next to a federaI seaside preserve
- Assateague Island.

02:47.440 --> 02:50.591
- That's where the money pit is.
- Money pit?

02:50.680 --> 02:55.196
Legend is Assateague Island is
where Blackbeard buried his treasure.

02:55.280 --> 03:00.354
For 300 years people have tried to find it.
They've dug it out to 150ft but found nothing.

03:00.440 --> 03:04.274
Every time they come close, they
trigger a baffle that floods the pit.

03:04.360 --> 03:07.432
- Booby traps.
- The body was found at a dig site.

03:07.520 --> 03:11.513
This is the first concrete evidence
that the treasure is more than a legend.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.956
- This is from a man who buried the treasure.
- Pure conjecture.

03:15.040 --> 03:16.996
- A pirate.
- Pirate?

03:17.080 --> 03:19.640
- It's a pirate.
- You can't change yours.

03:19.720 --> 03:22.314
The victim finds evidence
the treasure exists.

03:22.400 --> 03:26.029
Somebody else wants it. Certainly
that's a good motive for murder.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.634
We gotta get to that dig
site. I'll be glad to help.

03:28.720 --> 03:31.359
- I can handle it.
- Come on, man. Share the wealth.

03:31.440 --> 03:34.512
We are looking for
answers, Jack, not treasure.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.831
- Do you really think that treasure exists?
- What do you think?

03:39.520 --> 03:41.511
Why are you guys smiling?

03:42.080 --> 03:44.674
Pirates!

03:44.760 --> 03:47.069
It's a guy thing, sweetie.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:57.240 --> 03:59.231
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

04:09.760 --> 04:12.433
So the dead guy, Macy, ran the dig.

04:12.520 --> 04:16.308
With his partner Hardewicke. He was
hired by anyone with money to burn.

04:16.399 --> 04:18.709
People would do that? Sane people?

04:18.800 --> 04:21.837
- Look for treasure?
- Isn't that what archaeologists do?

04:21.920 --> 04:25.799
Archaeologists use evidence on
which to base their explorations,

04:25.880 --> 04:28.348
not some pirate movie they
saw when they were ten.

04:28.440 --> 04:31.637
Yeah, well, that 300-year-old
bone that we just found

04:31.720 --> 04:35.235
sort of changes things now,
doesn't it, there, matey?

04:35.320 --> 04:37.993
- What's going on over there?
- I tried to stop him.

04:38.080 --> 04:40.799
That's Branson Rose. The
mayor told me to let him in.

04:40.880 --> 04:45.078
- Branson Rose is funding this dig?
- Has for two years. Heard he was pulling out.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.754
- I'll take it from here.
- Who's Branson Rose?

04:47.840 --> 04:53.278
The billionaire adventurer. He made his
fortune making aircraft for the military.

04:53.360 --> 04:57.911
Owns about half the world. He has that reality
show that goes all over the world and...

04:58.000 --> 05:02.278
Still no TV. Why do I even bother? I...

05:02.360 --> 05:06.751
- You can't pull out now. We got a contract.
- So sue. But I doubt you have the resources.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.796
Mr Rose, we just broke 200ft.

05:08.880 --> 05:11.997
<i>If you pull out now, you'll miss out...</i>

05:12.080 --> 05:15.152
- I've been hearing that for two years.
- Uh, excuse me.

05:15.240 --> 05:18.755
- Macy knew it. He felt it. We're this close.
- Excuse me.

05:18.840 --> 05:23.197
Two years, $2 million, there's nothing
down there, Giles. Macy died for nothing.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.669
FBI! You're all under arrest.

05:26.880 --> 05:29.440
You don't get to say
that. I've got the badge.

05:29.520 --> 05:32.239
- The FBI's involved now?
- Murder on federaI land.

05:32.320 --> 05:34.959
- We like to poke around a little.
- Murder?

05:35.040 --> 05:37.235
Yeah. Murder.

05:38.320 --> 05:41.995
- You said it was an accident.
- That's what I thought.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.071
Oh, my God.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.760
He found something.

05:49.840 --> 05:52.877
Put my stuff back now!

05:52.960 --> 05:56.509
What did Macy find that would
be worth killing him for?

06:30.440 --> 06:35.719
In 1832, a team of six men looking for the
treasure were killed when a shaft collapsed.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.918
- Blackbeard's curse, man.
- A curse? We're scientists.

06:40.000 --> 06:45.632
Look at this. 1902. Two men disappeared
while digging. Never found their bodies.

06:45.720 --> 06:49.872
- Oh, that's very cursey.
- So you believe in pirates?

06:49.960 --> 06:54.875
Pirates aren't Santa, Zack. They did exist.
They did have treasures and they did bury it.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.155
I had an eye patch when I was six.

06:57.240 --> 07:00.118
Who didn't, my friend? Who didn't?

07:00.200 --> 07:02.589
It's not necessary to
lead me like a child.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.194
I'd rather not have more
evidence compromised.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.953
- You're squeezing my arm very tightly.
- Sorry.

07:08.040 --> 07:10.190
No, no. It's OK.

07:10.280 --> 07:13.158
- You can give it to Dr Hodgins.
- What is this?

07:13.240 --> 07:17.153
SoiI and water collected from
Ted Macy's throat and lungs.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.879
He was found floating
at the top of the shaft.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.030
We need you to do your dirt thing.

07:22.120 --> 07:25.795
Match the slime to the crime. Make
sure that's where he was killed.

07:25.880 --> 07:29.509
I'd like to look at X-rays
of the victim's skeleton.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.989
- Bossy.
- Do not go there.

07:32.080 --> 07:36.915
I need to determine if he died at the
top or died at the bottom and floated up.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.958
- I need silt abstracts from both levels.
- We'll get those.

07:40.040 --> 07:45.319
No, no. No. The soiI looks like an odd mixture
of clay, plagioclase feldspar, pyroxene.

07:45.400 --> 07:49.871
- I really wouldn't trust anyone else.
- You just want to look for treasure.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.188
Wha...?

07:51.280 --> 07:55.876
I am a serious scientist merely trying
to do my job as well as possible.

07:55.960 --> 08:00.636
That shaft is over 200ft deep, you
know? Requires an experienced diver.

08:00.720 --> 08:04.838
I am a certified cave diver, which
means I can go deeper than 200ft.

08:04.920 --> 08:07.480
I dove Mayan Blue, Dos Ojos, Tortuga.

08:07.560 --> 08:09.630
<i>- Ever dive Naharon?
- Once.</i>

08:09.720 --> 08:14.032
- I named Naharon.
- Well, then, how can you say no to me?

08:14.120 --> 08:16.793
OK. Butjust to collect soiI samples.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.996
Of course.

08:19.080 --> 08:23.596
- You dive too?
- I have the time because I don't own a TV.

08:23.680 --> 08:26.752
- You wear a rubber suit, then.
- Uh...

08:31.120 --> 08:35.955
Accidents happen, you know? Macy and
I were prepared for that. But murder?

08:36.039 --> 08:38.793
Murder, wow. Anything
I can do to help, OK?

08:38.880 --> 08:42.509
We'll talk about that later. I
want to get Hodgins down that shaft.

08:42.600 --> 08:47.116
Dane McGinnis. He's the best I
know. He's worked for us for years.

08:47.200 --> 08:52.354
<i>- Agent Booth? Are you Agent Booth?
- Sorry. Stay behind the yellow tape.</i>

08:52.440 --> 08:56.718
I'm Mayor Ney. Your men keep pushing
our tourists further and further back.

08:56.800 --> 09:00.315
Mayor? Wow. I hope you didn't look
like that when they elected you.

09:00.400 --> 09:04.871
Blackbeard's treasure is what keeps the
economy here running. The mayor gets that.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.633
- Sometimes too intensely.
- Hey, I'm not ashamed.

09:07.720 --> 09:10.188
I've increased tourism
63% since I took office.

09:10.280 --> 09:13.352
I can boost it more if the
tourists could get a closer look.

09:13.440 --> 09:17.035
- It's a murder scene, not a show.
- Blackbeard's curse.

09:17.120 --> 09:20.430
Macy would've wanted to give a
little back to the town he loved.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.875
The police are telling them no pictures.

09:22.960 --> 09:26.270
- Who is this? The pirate queen?
- That's right. My wife Katie.

09:26.360 --> 09:29.989
Great. You just tell the tourists
the bad view is part of the curse.

09:30.080 --> 09:33.789
Will you escort the pirate and
his wench behind the yellow tape?

09:33.880 --> 09:35.199
<i>Frank!</i>

09:35.280 --> 09:37.748
So Dane, he's an experienced guy?

09:37.840 --> 09:41.196
- I've worked with hundreds. He's the best.
- All right.

09:41.280 --> 09:45.034
I hope this guy knows what he's
doing. It's tight down there.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.554
Avast, ye lubbers!

09:52.920 --> 09:55.036
<i>Dane, let's get him ready.</i>

10:01.280 --> 10:05.512
- You think it's a pirate?
- It's a finger from the left hand of a male.

10:05.600 --> 10:09.229
- That's all I'm sure of so far.
- Worth killing for?

10:09.320 --> 10:13.029
I worked a case once where a woman
was killed, dismembered and burned

10:13.120 --> 10:15.998
because her friend thought
she'd taken her slippers.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.310
- Cheery.
- Maybe they're right.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.039
Maybe this man died
burying the treasure.

10:21.120 --> 10:25.750
Ironic. Stealing all that,
never enjoying the spoils.

10:25.840 --> 10:28.149
So you believe there's treasure?

10:28.240 --> 10:30.435
I believe there's greed.

10:31.240 --> 10:33.435
That's the reaI curse.

10:37.800 --> 10:41.031
All right, safety line, air hose.

10:41.120 --> 10:46.194
- Either one breaks, you ain't coming back up.
- You gotta work on your bedside manner.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.635
I don't wanna be
responsible for a weekender

10:48.720 --> 10:51.996
who buys it down there because
he thinks he's better than he is.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.116
You want to go down, don't you?

10:54.200 --> 10:58.079
It's my shaft, OK? I've
been working it ten years.

10:58.160 --> 11:02.073
The feds, they say it's a
crime scene, so I can't help.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.957
You're helping me.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.110
Why can't he just use the tank?

11:06.200 --> 11:10.432
Because about 100ft down
that shaft gets a little cosy.

11:10.520 --> 11:15.469
- You ain't afraid of a tight squeeze, are you?
- Gloves.

11:15.560 --> 11:19.075
Take it slow. A lot of stuff to
catch your hose on on the way down.

11:19.160 --> 11:22.038
<i>- Yeah, I saw the pictures Rose took.
- Rose.</i>

11:22.120 --> 11:25.157
He never went as far as
you're going. No one has.

11:25.240 --> 11:28.357
Maybe he shouldn't try.
People have died down there.

11:28.440 --> 11:31.159
I know. My brother was one of them.

11:33.640 --> 11:37.997
- I'm going all the way down. What's at 200ft?
- We just hit 200 last week.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.911
You're gonna have to tell me.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.468
- Well, I'm ready.
- OK.

12:14.840 --> 12:19.994
<i>- He better be as good as he says he is.
- You just take care of him, all right?</i>

12:26.280 --> 12:30.193
<i>- Hodgins, you read me?
- I hear you loud and clear.</i>

12:30.280 --> 12:34.751
<i>There's some jagged
edges. Keep clear of them.</i>

12:36.080 --> 12:37.877
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.029
Hodgins.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.793
<i>- It's warm.
- Passing the first flood trap.</i>

12:41.880 --> 12:43.916
We lost our first man there.

12:44.000 --> 12:48.312
- There's wood here below the limestone.
- Does he make any sense to you?

12:48.400 --> 12:51.278
Yeah. He's passing the site
of the first pit collapse.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.954
It's tight down here.

12:54.040 --> 12:57.669
There's a lot of debris. I'm not
sure if I can squeeze through.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.796
Hey, this guy swims like a squid.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.757
- He swims like a squint.
- What?

13:01.840 --> 13:05.071
<i>- Never mind.
- OK, I'm clear now.</i>

13:05.160 --> 13:08.709
Good picture too. We can't
get resolution like that.

13:08.800 --> 13:11.268
He's a geek. You ever
find anything down here?

13:11.360 --> 13:13.954
- Not yet.
- Ten years of nothing, you keep trying?

13:14.040 --> 13:17.555
- It's all about the search, man.
- He's at 170ft.

13:20.640 --> 13:22.949
180.

13:24.360 --> 13:27.511
90. No one's ever been this deep.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.071
He's at 200.

13:30.160 --> 13:32.993
<i>Touchdown. I am on the bottom.</i>

13:33.080 --> 13:35.753
<i>Visibility is surprisingly good.</i>

13:36.200 --> 13:39.476
<i>Wait a minute. There's...
there's something here.</i>

13:40.120 --> 13:41.678
- Holy...
- What is that?

13:41.760 --> 13:43.955
<i>- Oh, my...
- Is that...?</i>

13:46.880 --> 13:49.553
<i>- Oh, my God.
- It's there!</i>

13:52.200 --> 13:54.191
<i>Can you believe that?</i>

13:56.040 --> 13:58.508
<i>I'm amazed you found
a complete skeleton.</i>

13:58.600 --> 14:01.592
<i>C-14 dating matches at 300 years.</i>

14:01.680 --> 14:05.070
Subject is male. Early 20s.

14:05.160 --> 14:09.392
Approximately five feet six inches.

14:09.480 --> 14:12.631
Legs are bowed, result of
calcium and phosphate deficiency.

14:12.720 --> 14:16.633
He had rickets as a child but
his upper body is well developed.

14:16.720 --> 14:20.110
EpiphyseaI separation in the long bones.

14:20.200 --> 14:25.354
Sunken sternum forms scorbutic
rosary at costochondraI margin.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.750
- He had scurvy and tertiary syphilis.
- What's with "tertiary"?

14:28.840 --> 14:34.039
- Isn't plain old syphilis bad enough?
- Scurvy, syphilis... Pirate.

14:34.120 --> 14:39.877
AnthropologicaI evidence supports the claim
that Blackbeard executed his buriaI crews.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.234
OK.

14:41.320 --> 14:44.232
<i>- Let's say it's a pirate.
- Yes!</i>

14:44.320 --> 14:46.914
This would be an extraordinary find.

14:47.000 --> 14:53.075
- And opens up the reality of the treasure.
- It would be stupid to dismiss anything.

14:53.160 --> 14:58.359
But we need to discover why the ossein isn't
fully decomposed from being waterlogged.

14:58.440 --> 15:02.319
50ft down the shaft is a layer of blue
putty consisting of silicon and clay.

15:02.400 --> 15:06.109
- It forms a watertight seaI.
- That explains the bones' condition.

15:06.200 --> 15:11.558
I took samples of the same clay between 200
and 207ft. Something is buried down there.

15:11.640 --> 15:15.553
- These bones were on top of it.
- Macy was killed cos of something he found.

15:15.640 --> 15:18.677
The silt in his throat confirms
he was killed at the top.

15:18.760 --> 15:20.716
After he swam back up with the treasure.

15:21.480 --> 15:25.393
SpeciaI Agent Booth. I hate to
interrupt your investigation,

15:25.480 --> 15:30.554
but there's an angry billionaire
in my office and he won't go away.

15:30.640 --> 15:34.952
It's simple. You have something that
belongs to me and I'm not leaving without it.

15:35.040 --> 15:39.033
A day ago, you couldn't wait to leave,
cut your losses. You remember that?

15:39.120 --> 15:42.715
- A lot can change in a day.
- Yeah. For Ted Macy, a lot changed.

15:42.800 --> 15:46.839
I'm sorry about Ted, but I'll be damned
if the federaI government swoops in

15:46.920 --> 15:49.275
and steals what I've
been trying to find.

15:49.360 --> 15:53.751
- I faiI to see what this has to do with us.
- Those bones belong to me.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.876
They were uncovered at my site.

15:55.960 --> 16:01.273
I was granted a permit to dig
there and keep what was found.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.477
My attorneys assure me you
have no claim to those bones.

16:04.560 --> 16:07.393
Your attorney wants to go to
court for the next 20 years

16:07.480 --> 16:09.869
and buy himself a
vacation home in Tuscany,

16:09.960 --> 16:14.556
but the fact is when Ted Macy was
murdered, your property became our evidence.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.518
It's going to stay that way
untiI we find the killer.

16:17.600 --> 16:21.036
<i>I was hoping to settle this amicably.</i>

16:21.120 --> 16:25.113
- Really? Because we haven't seen that yet.
- Nah.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.953
This will be a headache.
He has important friends.

16:28.040 --> 16:31.032
Why is he so upset? It's
not like he needs the money.

16:31.120 --> 16:35.671
But his partners do. Macy and Hardewicke
were going to split what they found.

16:35.760 --> 16:37.955
- But Macy is dead.
- Exactly.

16:38.040 --> 16:41.510
Leaving Hardewicke with
a bigger piece of the pie.

16:41.600 --> 16:44.956
<i>This is from our very
first dig together.</i>

16:45.040 --> 16:49.716
We found this chest buried under a flood
drain up in Smith Cove in New England.

16:49.800 --> 16:54.590
There was no treasure, butjust to unearth
something that old, had that much history...

16:54.680 --> 16:57.990
- We were hooked.
- I glanced through your company history.

16:58.080 --> 17:01.072
Business was slow since you
didn't find any treasure.

17:01.160 --> 17:04.196
- You were getting fewer clients.
- It's been difficult.

17:04.280 --> 17:07.589
Branson Rose was
almost your last chance.

17:07.680 --> 17:10.240
Somebody always wants
to look for treasure.

17:10.319 --> 17:11.719
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:11.800 --> 17:16.078
If Rose pulls out you'd get a lot of
publicity. Could end up sinking your business.

17:16.160 --> 17:20.756
Macy found something and we'll share the
find with Rose. 50% for him, 50 for us.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.796
Exactly.

17:22.880 --> 17:29.274
Oh, I see. More for me if Macy's out of the
picture, right? You're forgetting one thing.

17:29.360 --> 17:31.749
- Macy was like family to me.
- Really?

17:31.840 --> 17:36.391
Look at this. See that? I got that
pulling Macy out of a sinkhole back in '93.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.710
He's got of scars on
him because of me too.

17:38.800 --> 17:43.669
How'd you get all those bruises
around your scar there, huh?

17:43.760 --> 17:46.433
- The mayor.
- How's the mayor figure into all this?

17:46.520 --> 17:50.911
His wife. You saw her, right? Well, Macy was
a bit of a hound, if you know what I mean.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.913
- He was sleeping with the pirate queen?
- The mayor got suspicious.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.515
I ended up taking the heat for
Macy because Macy's like my brother.

17:58.600 --> 18:02.559
That pirate can kick. I'm lucky he
didn't have time to load that flintlock.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.551
<i>Charlie!</i>

18:05.000 --> 18:09.516
What? No! Put that down! Leave
it there! What are you doing?

18:12.960 --> 18:14.996
Zack? Zack!

18:15.080 --> 18:17.833
- What did you do with the bones?
- Nothing.

18:17.920 --> 18:21.515
I left them on the table
just like you asked.

18:23.120 --> 18:25.759
Where the hell are my bones?

18:28.120 --> 18:31.635
Bones don'tjust disappear! I
thought this was a secure facility.

18:31.720 --> 18:37.352
You assured me this was a secure facility.
This never would've happened at Stanford!

18:37.440 --> 18:40.876
- We spend $0.75 million on security.
- Obviously not enough!

18:40.960 --> 18:43.190
I want my bones. Did you find my bones?

18:43.280 --> 18:46.033
- Whoa. Maybe you wanna chill a little?
- Chill?

18:46.120 --> 18:48.236
- You know, take a pill?
- Listen, dude.

18:48.320 --> 18:53.269
My lab was violated, my bones were stolen, so
I think I'll remain warm for a while longer.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.749
Maybe you should focus
on your breathing.

18:55.840 --> 18:58.559
- Count to ten. Have a shot of Jack.
- A shot of Jack.

18:58.640 --> 19:02.474
We're doing everything we can. I
promise you we're gonna find your bones.

19:02.560 --> 19:05.711
But you have to allow us to do ourjob.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.997
I guess I wasn't helping
all that much, was I?

19:09.560 --> 19:12.233
I...

19:12.320 --> 19:14.788
- I'm...
- "Sorry. "

19:16.280 --> 19:18.748
- It's cooI.
- Hey, look on the bright side.

19:18.840 --> 19:21.912
This whole theft thing
could be good for us, right?

19:22.000 --> 19:25.390
Whoever took the bones obviously
had something to do with the murder.

19:25.480 --> 19:28.916
On-duty security personneI are
giving an account of their rounds.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.390
<i>- Off-duty personneI as well.
- They didn't get everything.</i>

19:32.480 --> 19:36.996
- I thought all the bones were on the table?
- I was examining the originaI finger bone.

19:37.080 --> 19:39.913
So it was in my room.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.028
There is something they don't
want us to find on this bone.

19:45.120 --> 19:48.157
Everyone knew Macy.
Helped Frank get elected.

19:48.240 --> 19:51.516
So you would categorise your
relationship as just friends?

19:51.600 --> 19:55.639
Yeah, friends. It's a small
town. We're all friends.

19:55.720 --> 19:58.553
Well, whoever killed
Macy wasn't too friendly.

19:58.640 --> 20:01.438
He wouldn't hurt a souI. Macy.

20:01.520 --> 20:03.351
He was a sweet guy.

20:03.440 --> 20:09.470
The way you're talking about him, it
seems like you were more than just friends.

20:09.560 --> 20:12.438
Hardewicke told you, right?
Like he's such a saint.

20:12.520 --> 20:16.877
- How involved were the two of you?
- It was just one of those things, you know?

20:16.960 --> 20:19.872
I wasn't gonna leave Frank or anything.

20:19.960 --> 20:24.636
I guess I wanted to be with a reaI adventurer
rather than a guy who dresses up like one.

20:24.720 --> 20:27.234
Frank went after Hardewicke.
He thought it was him.

20:27.320 --> 20:30.312
You think Frank killed
him? You saw Frank.

20:30.400 --> 20:35.520
Yeah, he's a little unstable and he finds
out somebody made a fooI of him twice, I...

20:35.600 --> 20:38.512
It's Hardewicke and the
rich guy you should look at.

20:38.600 --> 20:41.637
Macy said they were fighting
over the money they spent.

20:41.720 --> 20:45.349
Said Hardewicke wanted
to break up the company.

20:45.440 --> 20:48.000
Well, we're looking
into everyone. Thanks.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.470
Sure. But all this coming up again...

20:52.960 --> 20:55.679
just try not to ruin my marriage, OK?

20:55.760 --> 21:00.914
I made a mistake. But I love that stupid
pirate and I don't want to lose him.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.993
Well, thanks for talking
to me. I'll be in touch.

21:08.600 --> 21:12.718
The surface on the phalanx doesn't have
any particulates that I can recover.

21:12.800 --> 21:18.511
The solution the ME used dissolved anything
that was lodged in any surface irregularities.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.512
Who'd clean a bone before
extracting all information?

21:21.600 --> 21:25.388
- Not everyone is as thorough as we are, Zack.
- So true. So true.

21:25.480 --> 21:29.996
- I wonder if there was gold dust on it.
- You should have a parrot on your shoulder.

21:30.080 --> 21:34.153
- You're not curious?
- Yes, about the facts.

21:34.240 --> 21:39.439
There's a small hole along the
distaI articular facet of the finger.

21:39.520 --> 21:42.159
It could be a foramen or
something else, man-made.

21:42.240 --> 21:44.435
<i>- A weapon?
- Maybe.</i>

21:44.880 --> 21:47.917
See if you can find
any possible matches.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.197
- I wonder if there are similar marks on Macy?
- I'll find out.

21:51.280 --> 21:54.989
And don't let that
bone out of your sight.

21:59.240 --> 22:02.755
Dr Brennan thought you might've
overlooked a weapon of some kind.

22:02.840 --> 22:05.149
He wasn't killed by any weapon.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.231
He was strangled.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.959
The larynx is crushed. It's plain.

22:10.040 --> 22:14.556
C2 through C4 are fractured. That wouldn't
have occurred if you were strangled.

22:14.640 --> 22:17.438
If the victim was shaken
while being strangled...

22:17.520 --> 22:22.071
The fractures are all left to right,
approximately 45º angles on each bone.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.993
That means the head was
jerked to the left and up,

22:25.080 --> 22:27.548
making sure that the
spinaI cord would tear.

22:27.640 --> 22:30.074
The larynx was crushed
when his neck broke.

22:30.160 --> 22:34.950
I'm always open to being corrected. Why do
you think there might have been a weapon?

22:35.040 --> 22:38.271
I saw a perforation in the finger
bone you put in the solvent.

22:38.360 --> 22:41.796
Did you damage the bone?
Poke it? Stick it in some way?

22:41.880 --> 22:44.553
Still angry. OK, no.

22:44.640 --> 22:49.156
I handled it according to protocoI.
Rubber gloves, right into the solvent.

22:49.240 --> 22:54.519
Something damaged that bone and
it didn't happen 300 years...

22:56.120 --> 22:58.680
Wait a minute.

23:01.520 --> 23:06.150
I have alternatives that could've caused
the hole. This is an acupuncture needle.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.310
Come on. He was healed to death?

23:08.400 --> 23:11.551
This is a filament
used for an angioplasty.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.835
Hand me the wire.

23:19.680 --> 23:22.069
<i>- What you doing?
- Diminished fluorescence.</i>

23:22.160 --> 23:25.516
That only happens if the bones
have been cleaned and treated.

23:25.600 --> 23:29.070
These bones didn't start out in
the shaft. They were placed there.

23:29.160 --> 23:30.957
What?

23:31.960 --> 23:34.269
Who's got
300-year-old bones?

23:37.720 --> 23:40.154
I assure you everything
here is authentic.

23:40.240 --> 23:43.038
I curated this exhibit for
the Jeffersonian myself.

23:43.120 --> 23:45.714
Could you please open the case?

23:46.880 --> 23:49.678
This is a beautifuI specimen

23:49.760 --> 23:51.557
found in Jamaica.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.790
We believe he sailed with Henry Morgan.

23:53.880 --> 23:57.270
- He's never been on a boat in his life.
- That's absurd.

23:58.120 --> 24:01.635
- Oh, my God.
- These bones are artificiaI. It's acrylic.

24:01.720 --> 24:03.756
Not bone.

24:03.840 --> 24:07.435
You can see on the reaI bone the
hole where the wire was threaded

24:07.520 --> 24:10.751
when the bones were
assembled for display.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.671
Then where is the rest of my sailor?

24:12.760 --> 24:16.799
He was planted in Assateague Island to
make the treasure business seem reaI.

24:16.880 --> 24:19.075
- But somebody found out.
- Who?

24:19.520 --> 24:21.909
A murderer.

24:27.120 --> 24:29.395
<i>Let me see if I got this straight.</i>

24:29.480 --> 24:34.270
The pirate bones you recovered came
from the Jeffersonian to start with.

24:34.360 --> 24:37.352
- Correct. - 300-year-old
bones from our pirate exhibit.

24:37.440 --> 24:40.352
<i>- Recovered by one of your people?
- Dr Hodgins.</i>

24:40.440 --> 24:44.592
Who brought them back to the
Jeffersonian where they were stolen again?

24:44.680 --> 24:47.717
- Restolen, sir.
- You got a security problem, Dr Goodman.

24:47.800 --> 24:50.155
And you may have a murder problem.

24:50.240 --> 24:53.391
But I'm on top of it. You didn't
have to come down here, sir.

24:53.480 --> 24:56.677
I got a call from someone
at the Department of Defense.

24:56.760 --> 24:59.797
Defense? How do they figure
into a murder investigation?

24:59.880 --> 25:02.110
Branson Rose has friends in high places.

25:02.200 --> 25:05.556
They don't like it when the guy
who builds their bombers is unhappy.

25:05.640 --> 25:10.760
- Are they afraid he'll bomb them?
- Is that squint humour? I'm not laughing.

25:10.840 --> 25:14.719
Defense doesn't need a reason to go to
war and I won't be their next target.

25:14.800 --> 25:18.952
- We haven't ruled Rose out as a suspect.
- You're too busy looking for your bones.

25:19.040 --> 25:22.350
- Let's not get personaI.
- Rose wants to keep playing in the mud

25:22.440 --> 25:27.560
and his big-shot friends will see that happens
unless we come up with some answers fast.

25:27.640 --> 25:33.192
At this point, it appears as if the stolen bones
are being used to, you know, salt the shaft.

25:33.280 --> 25:36.078
- Salt the shaft?
- An investor spends $1 million.

25:36.160 --> 25:39.550
He gets antsy when nothing
happens, then pirate bones appear

25:39.640 --> 25:43.030
and the golden goose keeps,
you know, laying those eggs.

25:43.120 --> 25:45.759
OK, that is a convoluted
metaphor, Booth.

25:45.840 --> 25:50.755
- It's a hoax, Dr Brennan, like Piltdown Man.
- Oh, got it. Why can't you be clear like that?

25:50.840 --> 25:53.798
- Assuming the bones were stolen...
- Restolen.

25:53.880 --> 25:56.997
.. so you wouldn't find out
they were bogus, how did you?

25:57.080 --> 25:59.036
- How did I what?
- From the finger.

25:59.120 --> 26:03.272
Would you like Dr Brennan to
take you through the process?

26:03.360 --> 26:06.670
- I really wouldn't. So, who do you like?
- I like the partner.

26:06.760 --> 26:08.955
- Hardewicke.
- Access, motive, ability.

26:09.040 --> 26:13.750
The FBI will provide whatever help you
need to solve your breach of security.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.751
You work the partner angle.

26:19.880 --> 26:22.440
Well, my father worked the fishing boat.

26:22.520 --> 26:26.672
His dad before that. Heck, me and my
brother, we never knew anything but the sea.

26:26.760 --> 26:30.070
Hunting for treasure just sort
of grew out of that, I guess.

26:30.160 --> 26:33.391
- Any regrets?
- Sure. My brother.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.717
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:35.800 --> 26:38.519
That and the fact that
they might shut us down.

26:38.600 --> 26:41.672
Not if we find something, huh?

26:41.760 --> 26:44.877
I thought you were gonna
be just another deskjockey

26:44.960 --> 26:48.839
who read a few books and was looking
for something to brighten up his life.

26:48.920 --> 26:50.831
I'd be down that shaft right now

26:50.920 --> 26:55.038
if Big Brother didn't have the
minimum time requirement between dives.

26:55.480 --> 26:59.439
You deserve to be here. You really do.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.511
Thanks for that.

27:02.440 --> 27:07.150
I guess it's all right to tell
you, the bones were planted.

27:09.760 --> 27:14.754
- You don't seem surprised.
- Nothing surprises me out of that pit.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.592
Nah.

27:16.680 --> 27:20.593
I mean, you dig down far
enough, you come out in hell.

27:20.680 --> 27:24.992
So, uh, if you don't find anything,
are you gonna shut us down?

27:25.080 --> 27:27.594
Hey, I'm not FBI! I'm just a scientist.

27:27.680 --> 27:30.672
It's a crime scene. I'm
surprised they let you down there.

27:30.760 --> 27:35.436
I'm an expert in silt, plants and insects.
That's right. I got three doctorates.

27:35.520 --> 27:36.157
Whoa!

27:36.240 --> 27:40.358
When you got three doctorates and you
need more samples, who's gonna argue?

27:40.440 --> 27:44.638
One doctorate, yeah, maybe
they argue. But three?

27:46.000 --> 27:49.390
You want to go back
down again, don't you?

27:51.880 --> 27:55.111
- I could use your help, man.
- You got the bug, man!

27:55.200 --> 27:58.112
Hey, like I said, I am the bug man.

28:01.640 --> 28:05.428
- How do you know the bones are fake?
- Thieves didn't get everything.

28:05.520 --> 28:10.753
- A stroke of luck for the good guys.
- We'll find out how those bones were stolen.

28:10.840 --> 28:12.671
You still think I did it, don't you?

28:12.760 --> 28:15.479
Why were you going to
break up the company?

28:15.560 --> 28:18.836
- Katie Ney told you that.
- What makes you think it was Katie?

28:18.920 --> 28:23.357
That was a stock part of Macy's seduction
technique and it was very effective.

28:23.440 --> 28:28.594
"I risk my life down in that hole
while my partner stays safe topside. "

28:28.680 --> 28:32.275
That's how he positioned
himself as the heroic explorer.

28:32.360 --> 28:36.433
- Which he was, when it came to the ladies.
- Your partnership was intact?

28:36.520 --> 28:41.878
Till death did us part. I'll tell you what, I'm
gonna give you guys full access to the books.

28:41.960 --> 28:44.235
You don't even need a search warrant.

28:44.320 --> 28:49.269
There's not a single way in which
my life is better off without Macy.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.954
Like I said, I miss the man.

28:55.200 --> 28:58.272
The bones were stolen twice.
The first time from the exhibit,

28:58.360 --> 29:00.954
the second time from
the Medico-LegaI Lab.

29:01.040 --> 29:04.237
The security in the lab is
tighter so the camera is continuous

29:04.320 --> 29:07.232
but the camera in the
rotunda is stop-action.

29:07.320 --> 29:13.111
I started with the lab theft because we know
the bones were stolen between 9pm and 6am.

29:13.200 --> 29:17.478
OK, watch... here.

29:17.560 --> 29:20.518
- The bones are gone.
- Notice the time code.

29:21.440 --> 29:24.637
<i>- What's that?
- The camera was turned off.</i>

29:24.720 --> 29:27.917
The camera was turned off
for one minute and 46 seconds.

29:28.000 --> 29:32.790
It would take a lot less time than that to
enter the room, gather up the bones and escape.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.118
Now.

29:36.200 --> 29:37.838
- Dr Goodman?
- Yes?

29:37.920 --> 29:41.674
Can I ask, why are we doing this
investigation instead of security?

29:41.760 --> 29:45.036
We shouldn't walk too quickly.
It would arouse suspicion.

29:45.120 --> 29:47.998
I'm happy to help but we
have security professionals.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.594
Can we tell if those
tapes have been doctored?

29:50.680 --> 29:54.753
Yeah, since they're physicaI
magnetic tapes, not stored digitally.

29:54.840 --> 29:57.229
I always did like
analogue. Now I know why.

29:57.320 --> 30:01.757
I'm only an amateur at this. I'm sure the
security department is better equipped...

30:01.840 --> 30:05.150
Afternoon, PauI. Best to Susan.
I hope Johnny feels better.

30:05.240 --> 30:10.792
<i>- Thank you, Dr Goodman.
- OK, you don't want to talk about it. I get it.</i>

30:10.880 --> 30:14.555
- Sir?
- Hit your stopwatch, Miss Montenegro.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.551
35.6 seconds.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.915
For a round trip, one
minute ten seconds,

30:19.000 --> 30:22.037
leaving 30 seconds to bag
the bones and get back.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.111
Get back where?

30:25.440 --> 30:27.670
Oh. Huh.

30:27.760 --> 30:30.991
- Wow. You must think I'm an idiot.
- I was grandstanding.

30:31.080 --> 30:36.996
We find out what guards were on duty during
the two thefts and we might have our thief.

30:37.080 --> 30:41.278
- I didn't see the harm.
- In stealing human remains?

30:41.360 --> 30:44.750
After 300 years it's not like
he's got a family grieving for him.

30:44.840 --> 30:48.276
- Think of me as a grieving parent.
- Grand theft, that's eight years.

30:48.360 --> 30:50.715
- If I don't kill you.
- Come on.

30:50.800 --> 30:53.951
What's a bunch of old bones
like that worth? Nothing.

30:54.040 --> 30:56.634
- How much did you get?
- A couple of hundred bucks.

30:56.720 --> 31:02.670
<i>Yeah. So this, uh... wire transfer into
your bank for ten grand, what's that?</i>

31:02.760 --> 31:04.751
Inheritance?

31:05.880 --> 31:08.758
<i>Who did you steaI them for?</i>

31:09.880 --> 31:13.236
- We didn't do the name exchange thing.
- Somebody approached you?

31:13.320 --> 31:15.311
Yeah.

31:16.640 --> 31:20.155
- Let's see. OK. Which one was it?
- Which time?

31:22.480 --> 31:24.471
The first time.

31:24.920 --> 31:26.672
<i>Him.</i>

31:26.760 --> 31:29.149
But he looked better.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.276
- And the second time?
- Uh...

31:32.040 --> 31:33.917
Him.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.389
Look, guys, I'm cooperating.

31:36.480 --> 31:41.031
All right? I will give back the money. I
will quit my job. How's about we call it even?

31:41.120 --> 31:44.396
You need a better screening
process down at the museum.

31:44.480 --> 31:48.712
- Ironic, given we contract that out to the FBI.
- The...

31:49.960 --> 31:54.272
- You think he's dangerous?
- Grand theft? Murder? Yeah.

31:54.360 --> 31:56.874
The music. Shh. It's down there.

31:56.960 --> 32:00.032
It's not music. It's bagpipes. Whoa.

32:02.400 --> 32:05.039
Mr Hardewicke?

32:10.040 --> 32:12.349
Mr Hard...

32:12.440 --> 32:13.509
Oh.

32:16.240 --> 32:19.915
Maybe we're looking for someone else.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.352
The larynx was crushed.

32:25.440 --> 32:29.035
- Is that your cause-of-death
ruling? - We gonna have another fight?

32:29.120 --> 32:33.193
If you keep pushing like that, it's
gonna be me who smacks you around.

32:33.280 --> 32:37.353
How do you know that won't
work for me just as well?

32:38.320 --> 32:40.788
You ruled that Macy died
from a crushed larynx.

32:40.880 --> 32:44.998
A crushed larynx is fataI.
Ergo, it results in death.

32:45.080 --> 32:48.789
- You were wrong then and you're wrong now.
- See? He likes it!

32:48.880 --> 32:52.714
I need to see both sets
of X-rays. His and Macy's.

32:55.720 --> 32:59.679
It's not always about
being right or wrong.

32:59.760 --> 33:06.029
It's about the dialogue. Intense conversation
is the most wonderfuI kind of intercourse.

33:06.120 --> 33:07.917
This guy is a pervert.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.834
Damage between C2 and C4, 45º angle,

33:11.920 --> 33:15.037
exact same pattern of injury as Macy.

33:15.120 --> 33:20.638
His head was wrenched around, probably
while the other hand crushed the larynx.

33:20.720 --> 33:22.915
Must frustrate you that I missed that.

33:23.000 --> 33:27.118
Wait. That's a SpeciaI Forces move.
Crush the larynx so he can't scream.

33:27.200 --> 33:31.671
- You've done that to people?
- No. Our murderer is SpeciaI Forces.

33:31.760 --> 33:35.196
Your internet bio says you spent
time in SpeciaI Air Services.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.794
Mr Rose has led a diverse and full life.

33:37.880 --> 33:40.713
How did you feeI when you
found out the site was salted?

33:40.800 --> 33:43.553
- I was disappointed.
- Just disappointed?

33:43.640 --> 33:47.155
I wasn't irked enough to kill
Ted Macy. Can we get to the point?

33:47.240 --> 33:48.832
What is SpeciaI Air Services?

33:48.920 --> 33:54.119
The SAS is widely regarded as one of the
finest SpeciaI Forces units in the world.

33:54.200 --> 33:58.432
<i>- See any active service?
- Mr Rose does not discuss specifics.</i>

33:58.520 --> 34:01.910
I don't exploit my role in
operations which cost men their lives.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.754
If all you're interested in is my
history, there's a bio on my website.

34:05.840 --> 34:12.109
We wanted to know if your reputation is for
reaI. We'll just contact the SAS. They'll tell us.

34:12.199 --> 34:14.190
- Well, look...
- Fine.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.594
Don't expect a speedy response.

34:18.120 --> 34:19.678
- Bones!
- That's assault!

34:19.760 --> 34:22.752
Would a SpeciaI Forces guy
have been able to stop that?

34:22.840 --> 34:26.833
- I don't know. You got the jump on him there.
- This one won't be a surprise.

34:26.920 --> 34:28.478
- You ready?
- What?

34:28.560 --> 34:30.949
This is common assault.
Charges will be laid.

34:31.040 --> 34:33.554
No way he's speciaI ops.
It's a bunch of PR crap.

34:33.639 --> 34:37.030
- No more questions.
- I demand she be arrested for assault!

34:37.120 --> 34:39.110
Shut up, Kendall.

34:40.880 --> 34:45.396
Think I want it all over the newspapers that
I'm taking a woman to court for slapping me?

34:45.719 --> 34:50.271
- You won't get into trouble for this?
- Three degrees. Just doing some research.

34:50.360 --> 34:55.070
I am telling you, salted or not, there
is something at the bottom of that shaft.

34:55.159 --> 34:57.276
I never got to go all the way down.

34:57.360 --> 35:00.352
The bones were on wood. I
want to see what's underneath.

35:00.440 --> 35:04.752
- I always thought it'd be me who'd find it.
- Hey, all for one and one for all, right?

35:04.840 --> 35:08.515
<i>- That was The Three Musketeers.
- They were always piratey to me.</i>

35:08.600 --> 35:10.989
- Let's do this.
- Let's do it.

35:17.360 --> 35:19.351
Hey.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.749
Dispatch, 22705.

35:46.840 --> 35:51.470
Last name McGinnis, first name Dane. I need
to know which military branch he served in.

35:51.560 --> 35:54.472
<i>Affirmative, 22705. Stand by.</i>

35:54.560 --> 35:57.074
- Why Dane?
- He said Hodgins swam like a squid.

35:57.160 --> 35:59.196
Squint. He must've said squint.

35:59.280 --> 36:04.070
No, I said squint, OK? Dane said squid,
which is military slang for a sailor.

36:04.160 --> 36:06.196
Is this what they call a HaiI Mary pass?

36:06.640 --> 36:08.995
<i>- Y ou receiving?
- Loud and clear.</i>

36:09.080 --> 36:10.911
<i>Man, it's muddy today.</i>

36:11.000 --> 36:14.788
Yeah? Usually it clears up past
the first flood channeI at 12m.

36:18.520 --> 36:23.913
Don't conjure up any ghosts. There's too
many down there waiting to claim your ass.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.594
Ghosts? Right.

36:27.840 --> 36:31.674
<i>22705, Dispatch. McGinnis,
Dane, served in the navy.</i>

36:31.760 --> 36:35.070
<i>Rating, chief petty officer,
Naval Special Warfare.</i>

36:35.160 --> 36:38.391
- Oh, yeah. Had to be.
- What?

36:48.480 --> 36:51.313
- Guy was a Navy SEAL.
- So? You were a guide.

36:51.400 --> 36:55.837
A Ranger. I was a Ranger,
Bones, OK? I was not a guide.

36:55.920 --> 36:59.799
Guides, they show you waterfalls,
they sell you cookies. I was a Ranger.

36:59.880 --> 37:03.316
<i>What's he doing at the shaft?</i>

37:03.400 --> 37:06.312
- Are Rangers afraid of SEALs?
- What? Come on. No.

37:06.400 --> 37:12.270
Rangers aren't afraid of anybody. All
right? SEALs are pretty good, though.

37:23.920 --> 37:27.151
- Hey, Dane.
- Oh, hey. What's up?

37:27.240 --> 37:29.117
- We know it was you.
- Bones.

37:29.200 --> 37:32.033
- You have a gun. What's he got?
- Somebody in the shaft.

37:32.120 --> 37:34.793
- How far down am I?
- Is that Hodgins?

37:34.880 --> 37:37.394
<i>Hey, Dane?</i>

37:37.480 --> 37:39.710
<i>I can't read my depth display.</i>

37:42.760 --> 37:44.671
Hey, is something going on?

37:45.120 --> 37:48.078
<i>Is there anybody up there?
Why don't you answer me?</i>

37:48.160 --> 37:51.436
CPO McGinnis, step
away from the air hose.

37:51.520 --> 37:55.399
Yeah? Well, I need you to
toss that gun into the shaft,

37:55.480 --> 37:59.189
and toss me your keys, and
handcuff yourselves to that crane.

37:59.280 --> 38:03.751
I take your truck. Otherwise, I am going
to cut this hose and your buddy's gonna die.

38:03.840 --> 38:07.196
- Yeah. Do that.
- Bones... Not gonna happen.

38:07.280 --> 38:10.238
<i>If you can hear me, tug on the air hose.</i>

38:10.320 --> 38:15.269
I feeI a blast of cold water. It's a spring
or some kind of conduit from the ocean.

38:15.360 --> 38:17.476
It's clear water. Visibility is better.

38:17.560 --> 38:20.154
You killed two men. I
can't let you drive away.

38:20.240 --> 38:26.315
Those guys. Putting fake bones in there,
making the whole thing into a con job.

38:26.400 --> 38:29.710
My brother died down there
looking for that treasure.

38:29.800 --> 38:34.669
A lot of good men did. This was their
life. Those men dishonoured them.

38:34.760 --> 38:38.594
Dane, can you hear me,
man? I am on the bottom.

38:38.680 --> 38:41.399
You good enough to take
that shot before I cut this?

38:41.480 --> 38:43.471
- Pretty good.
- Just pretty good?

38:43.560 --> 38:45.915
Please. I'm working.

38:47.680 --> 38:51.719
<i>I'm gonna need some more slack in the
line, Dane. I mean, what's going on?</i>

38:51.800 --> 38:54.314
<i>I'll get a sample.</i>

38:54.400 --> 38:58.154
I can see where the shaft
wall has collapsed before.

39:00.400 --> 39:03.472
<i>Oh, my God. Holy...</i>

39:03.560 --> 39:04.709
<i>Damn!</i>

39:04.800 --> 39:08.315
<i>Can you see this, Dane?</i>

39:08.400 --> 39:09.958
- What is it?
- Take a look.

39:10.040 --> 39:12.349
Yeah. I do, you'll shoot me.

39:15.080 --> 39:17.389
Dane? Can you see this, man?

39:17.480 --> 39:19.630
- It's a gold coin.
- Yeah.

39:19.720 --> 39:22.280
Probably something else
they stole from the museum.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.477
<i>This is real! It's a big...</i>

39:28.240 --> 39:31.630
You want to see it, you're going
to have to bring Hodgins up.

39:31.720 --> 39:35.508
Please. He's down there
because he believes.

39:36.320 --> 39:39.437
He's no different than you,
no different than your brother.

39:39.520 --> 39:41.590
Bring him up.

39:41.680 --> 39:44.274
<i>Do it for your brother.</i>

39:55.840 --> 39:58.798
An originaI Breen 984 half doubloon,

39:58.880 --> 40:02.077
designed by Ephraim Brasher,
engraved by Ephraim Brasher,

40:02.160 --> 40:06.551
and, hold your breath,
gentlemen and ladies, 204 grains.

40:06.640 --> 40:09.598
- A reaI gold pirate coin.
- How many more are down there?

40:09.680 --> 40:13.559
Rose agreed to have the museum do
the authentication of the treasure.

40:13.640 --> 40:16.154
- There won't be any more.
- Why do you say that?

40:16.240 --> 40:19.391
I was down there. It's not
gonna give it up that easily.

40:19.480 --> 40:22.756
- The treasure's been located.
- I'm sure it's been located before.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.831
I'll take that.

40:29.440 --> 40:34.719
- You think he's happy to be back home?
- Well, he looks that way to me.

40:38.280 --> 40:39.838
Ha.

40:39.920 --> 40:41.911
- He's not happy.
- What do you mean?

40:42.000 --> 40:45.549
Hodgins is right. He'd be a lot
happier at the bottom of that shaft.

40:45.640 --> 40:47.915
With the other pirates.

40:49.400 --> 40:53.029
- Arrr!
- Arrr, matey. Arrr!

<i>Arrr!</i>
