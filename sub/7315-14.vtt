WEBVTT

00:03.036 --> 00:05.437
Gibbs:
You ever hear of a terrorist
named benham parsa?

00:05.439 --> 00:07.172
We used a hellfire missile
to destroy

00:07.174 --> 00:11.076
Hayat parsa is benham's sister
in pakistan.

00:11.078 --> 00:12.644
I've been monitoring
her communications since parsa

00:12.646 --> 00:14.613
Showed up
on the radar in '07.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.181
Tony:
Parsa's drone wasn't destroyed.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.050
He's using it
on the conrad gala.

00:19.486 --> 00:20.753
Gibbs:
<i>Benham parsa!</i>

00:20.755 --> 00:22.087
Hands above your head!

00:26.359 --> 00:28.560
Malik:
Parsa was hidden in a car.
I smuggled him.

00:28.562 --> 00:31.230
For my own safety,
I don't know where. He is gone.

00:31.232 --> 00:33.565
Get to work.
Get this son of a bitch.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.634
You find him.

00:45.412 --> 00:47.246
If you're trying
to be stealth,

00:47.248 --> 00:49.815
A less pungent cologne
would've been a smarter choice.

00:49.817 --> 00:52.451
Nobody wears cologne
anymore, bishop.

00:52.453 --> 00:54.219
It's body spray.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.621
Mountain musk,
I think.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.222
Well, it's... Bold.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.524
I'll accept bold.

00:58.526 --> 01:01.160
I'm also irritated.

01:01.162 --> 01:04.730
Why haven't you returned
my messages?

01:04.732 --> 01:07.232
(exhales)

01:07.234 --> 01:09.168
Ncis has been keeping me busy.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.370
When exactly were you going
to tell me you're working

01:11.372 --> 01:13.338
On benham parsa?
It was assigned to me.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.674
I didn't seek it out.
I was just doing my job.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.342
And, as your supervisor,
I'm doing mine.

01:17.344 --> 01:19.445
I'm still responsible
for your actions

01:19.447 --> 01:21.713
And well-being,
both of which concern me.

01:22.816 --> 01:24.750
Look, every agency out there
is after parsa

01:24.752 --> 01:26.351
Since the attack
on the conrad gala.

01:26.353 --> 01:28.353
You can't expect me
to just take a backseat.

01:28.355 --> 01:29.688
That's not
the point.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.356
You should have told me.

01:31.358 --> 01:34.159
I'm tempted to pull
your joint duty assignment.

01:34.161 --> 01:36.361
That's exactly
why I didn't tell you.

01:38.231 --> 01:40.199
Look, this isn't like last time.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.400
Sure feels like it.

01:41.402 --> 01:42.868
(sighs)

01:42.870 --> 01:44.436
What about gibbs?

01:44.438 --> 01:45.871
Does he know
what happened?

01:45.873 --> 01:47.272
Gibbs wants parsa caught.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.108
That's all that matters.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.242
Not to me.

01:51.211 --> 01:53.378
Look, marlens, I'm...

01:53.380 --> 01:54.813
You're right.

01:54.815 --> 01:57.382
Okay, I should have
told you.

01:57.384 --> 01:58.851
Just let me see this through.

01:58.853 --> 02:00.452
It's important.

02:00.454 --> 02:03.222
(sniffs)
all right.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.457
It's too cold
and you're too stubborn

02:05.459 --> 02:07.826
For me to continue this debate
right now.

02:07.828 --> 02:11.263
T.S. Eliot was wrong--
February is the cruelest month.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.599
How do you stand it like
this, in this weather?

02:13.601 --> 02:15.467
I mean, I miss that
florida humidity.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.136
I got to go.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.640
Bishop!

02:21.642 --> 02:24.276
(whistling happily)

02:26.246 --> 02:28.547
What's with you?
You got a hot date or something?

02:28.549 --> 02:31.316
Hot, indeed.
105 degrees fahrenheit.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.684
Picture this:

02:32.686 --> 02:34.753
A bottle of pinot,
roaring fire and me,

02:34.755 --> 02:37.222
Sliding into a hot, steamy soak.

02:37.224 --> 02:38.824
Yeah, I'd rather not
picture that.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.660
Well, sometimes you got to stop
and charge the batteries, tim,

02:41.662 --> 02:43.695
Get the old
juices flowing.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.831
I'm not really a bath person.
Course not.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.432
Baths are for kids. We're men.

02:47.434 --> 02:48.700
Men soak.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.235
What's the difference?

02:50.237 --> 02:52.371
These babies.

02:54.374 --> 02:57.910
"mighty aphrodite's
moisturizing bath beads.

02:57.912 --> 03:00.412
Unlock the goddess within"?
(chuckles)

03:00.414 --> 03:03.215
This girl introduced me to 'em
and, I'm telling you,

03:03.217 --> 03:05.484
I had no idea.
Exfoliates,

03:05.486 --> 03:07.352
Makes you tingle
in all the right places,

03:07.354 --> 03:08.387
You know what I mean?

03:08.389 --> 03:09.755
I'm so sorry I asked.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.490
Gibbs:
That makes two of us.

03:11.492 --> 03:12.591
Grab your gear.

03:12.593 --> 03:13.725
Port authority
in portsmouth

03:13.727 --> 03:15.227
Found a body
in the water.

03:15.229 --> 03:18.430
We put out on parsa's bodyguard.
Bishop:
Gibbs!

03:18.432 --> 03:20.966
Good, you're still here.
What's going on?

03:20.968 --> 03:22.534
Is there a rumble between
the sharks and the jets?

03:22.536 --> 03:24.870
What? No.
I-I have a lead on parsa.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.972
Yeah, so do we.
It's in virginia. Let's go.

03:26.974 --> 03:29.575
Wait, wait!
He's not in virginia.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.544
Bishop?

03:32.546 --> 03:34.880
Speak.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.682
Uh, parsa's going
to pakistan.

03:36.684 --> 03:38.317
I-I should have
seen it sooner.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.451
It all makes sense.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.954
Slow down. Make sense now.

03:41.956 --> 03:43.222
Salted hot chocolate.

03:45.625 --> 03:48.327
It's what I was drinking
the first time I read
about parsa's parents.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.862
Raza and sabeen parsa
were innocent civilians killed

03:50.864 --> 03:54.566
In a u.S. Air strike on pakistan
February 6, 2004.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.002
This event is what triggered the
psychological shift in parsa,

03:57.004 --> 03:58.804
Making him who he is today.

03:58.806 --> 04:02.541
Now, the ten-year anniversary
of their deaths is in 48 hours.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.378
He's going back
to where it started.

04:36.809 --> 04:39.444
Bishop:
Since 2007, parsa's been
impossible to track,

04:39.446 --> 04:41.747
Constantly falling off the grid
at different points.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.482
But that's where
there's a pattern.

04:43.484 --> 04:46.485
He's been dark the first week
of February, every year.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.586
It's his mourning period.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.588
He's a sentimental terrorist.

04:49.590 --> 04:52.491
Breaking my heart.
I'm telling you,
he's in pakistan.

04:52.493 --> 04:55.327
Cia has eyes on his sister,
hayat, in karachi.

04:55.329 --> 04:57.629
He's not in karachi. He'd go
to where his parents are buried.

04:57.631 --> 04:58.630
Which is where?

04:58.632 --> 05:00.499
No official record exists.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.833
Unofficially...

05:01.835 --> 05:04.369
I believe they're buried
in the swat district.

05:04.371 --> 05:06.371
How unofficial?

05:06.373 --> 05:08.307
Her gut.

05:08.309 --> 05:09.841
I should've figured.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.743
Why the swat district?

05:11.745 --> 05:13.612
For one,
his pashto dialect

05:13.614 --> 05:15.881
Has intonations
of the northwest region.

05:15.883 --> 05:18.717
And second, remnants
of the documents bashir
malik tried to destroy

05:18.719 --> 05:20.686
Mentioned parsa
being "out to sea."

05:20.688 --> 05:23.555
I'm guessing the dead body found
at the portsmouth cargo terminal

05:23.557 --> 05:25.557
Was no coincidence.
He's tying up loose ends

05:25.559 --> 05:27.793
Before boarding a freighter
out of the country, leon.

05:27.795 --> 05:30.362
Bishop:
Yes, but-but parsa
loves symbolism

05:30.364 --> 05:32.864
And wordplay. Now, a
translation of "two,

05:32.866 --> 05:35.567
T-w-o seas" in
arabic, "bahrain."

05:35.569 --> 05:36.868
Now, the main route

05:36.870 --> 05:38.403
That cuts
through the swat district,

05:38.405 --> 05:39.538
Bahrain road.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.975
Bishop, if you're right,

05:43.977 --> 05:47.379
Parsa's a needle
in a 2,000-square-mile haystack.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.715
That's a lot of ground to cover
in very little time.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.483
I'll loop in the other agencies,

05:51.485 --> 05:53.752
Get their parsa experts
to provide any more insight

05:53.754 --> 05:54.986
Into this theory.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.822
Uh, I can save you the time.

05:57.757 --> 05:59.524
Fbi, cia, nsa--

05:59.526 --> 06:00.992
They... They'd all
refer you to me.

06:00.994 --> 06:04.496
I am the parsa expert.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.732
Just how long has nsa
had you on him?

06:06.734 --> 06:07.799
Six years, director.

06:11.738 --> 06:13.472
Excuse me?

06:14.874 --> 06:16.641
Ducky:
I've always found it
quite remarkable

06:16.643 --> 06:20.645
How freezing conditions
can preserve human remains.

06:20.647 --> 06:22.748
In 1991,

06:22.750 --> 06:27.986
A 5,000-year-old body was
discovered in the otztal alps.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.988
Yes, the man was
so well-preserved

06:29.990 --> 06:32.691
That his last meal was still
in his system.

06:32.693 --> 06:36.695
I believe it was chamois
and red deer meat.

06:36.697 --> 06:39.097
(chuckles)
yes, I wonder

06:39.099 --> 06:42.167
What your digestive system
will share with us.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.503
Mr. Popsicle thaw out yet,
ducky?

06:44.505 --> 06:47.072
No, not sufficiently
to perform an autopsy.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.740
It's a slow process.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.842
Why don't we just stick him
under the french fry lamps?

06:50.844 --> 06:52.110
Make him crispy.
(chuckles)

06:52.112 --> 06:54.746
Thank you for that
astute medical suggestion,

06:54.748 --> 06:58.583
Tony, but the human body
is a bit more complex

06:58.585 --> 07:00.619
Than a beltway burger.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.454
Any way of knowing
if he was parsa's bodyguard

07:02.456 --> 07:03.588
Before the autopsy?

07:03.590 --> 07:05.190
Well, not from his prints.

07:05.192 --> 07:07.459
The marine life...
(grunts)

07:07.461 --> 07:09.928
Did a number
on his digits.
(tony groans)

07:09.930 --> 07:11.196
How about cause of death?

07:11.198 --> 07:12.798
Well, that
gunshot wound

07:12.800 --> 07:14.199
To the neck, I'd
venture, had something

07:14.201 --> 07:16.568
To do with it. Look...
(sighs)

07:16.570 --> 07:19.104
I'll know more
when I've done my examination.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.672
Clock's ticking.

07:20.674 --> 07:23.141
Patience is a virtue, tony.

07:23.143 --> 07:24.209
Not in the gibbs-iverse.

07:26.646 --> 07:28.480
Mcgee:
Thanks.
(hangs up phone)

07:28.482 --> 07:31.516
Cia intercepted
a call from hayat parsa,

07:31.518 --> 07:34.219
And she's gonna meet her brother
tomorrow outside karachi.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.720
That doesn't make any sense.

07:35.722 --> 07:38.056
Parsa's always kept his distance
from hayat.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.958
He knows it's the only
way to protect her.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.560
And he knows
she's being watched.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.627
It's a mislead.

07:43.863 --> 07:44.963
Boss,

07:44.965 --> 07:46.965
We think that...
Bishop. Now.

07:51.604 --> 07:54.573
I asked you to tell me
what you knew about parsa.

07:54.575 --> 07:55.874
And I have.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.042
Not everything.

07:59.879 --> 08:02.647
I don't like people lying to me.

08:02.649 --> 08:05.650
I didn't lie.
You never specifically asked me

08:05.652 --> 08:06.885
About my connection
to the parsa case.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.153
I'm asking you now, bishop.

08:09.956 --> 08:11.022
What aren't you telling me?

08:12.592 --> 08:15.160
The details to that nsa
assignment are compartmented.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.928
I can't tell you
without the proper clearance.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.230
You can't tell me?

08:18.232 --> 08:19.664
Or you won't tell me?

08:19.666 --> 08:21.666
It's not relevant
to the current situation.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.602
My situation,
bishop,

08:23.604 --> 08:25.704
Is I don't work with people
I can't trust.

08:25.706 --> 08:28.707
We have 48 hours
to find parsa before he's gone

08:28.709 --> 08:30.976
Or we're back to square one.
Trust me on that.

08:44.624 --> 08:45.957
Hey, tim.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.859
Whoa. Take it
easy, mcgrabbie.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.295
I'm doing you a favor.
You do not want to go in there.

08:50.297 --> 08:51.696
Ooh...

08:52.732 --> 08:54.099
They haven't looked
at each other all morning.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.233
Yeah.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.202
You could cut that tension
with a knife.

08:57.204 --> 09:00.171
Oh, it's bad, tony.
I'm having flashbacks
to my childhood.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.840
Reminds me
of Sunday dinners with dad

09:01.842 --> 09:03.675
And stepmoms two and four.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.644
What should we do?

09:05.646 --> 09:07.078
Same thing I
did as a kid:

09:07.080 --> 09:08.713
Keep your head down,
wait to be excused,

09:08.715 --> 09:10.582
Then go to your room
and play with yourself.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.651
Play-play...
(vance clears throat)

09:14.654 --> 09:17.722
(chuckles)
I meant "play by
yourself," not...

09:17.724 --> 09:19.724
Um, "with."

09:19.726 --> 09:21.760
Always had a problem
with the stepmoms.

09:21.762 --> 09:24.195
I'm not quite sure
why. Maybe, um...

09:24.197 --> 09:26.698
I don't know. Maybe I just
wasn't being honest with them.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.800
Do I look like dr. Phil
to you, agent dinozzo?

09:28.802 --> 09:30.835
You've got the mustache.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.904
We were just getting
back to work, sir.

09:35.141 --> 09:37.142
(exhales)
you can unclench now, tim.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.744
We're in the clear.
(exhales)

09:43.983 --> 09:45.050
Hey, boss.

09:47.286 --> 09:50.355
You two have something
case-related to share?

09:50.357 --> 09:53.291
I checked the manifests
of all the freighters
that left portsmouth last week.

09:53.293 --> 09:54.960
There was one russian
cargo freighter that had

09:54.962 --> 09:57.762
An unregistered passenger on
it. Turns out that guy was

09:57.764 --> 09:59.864
Helicoptered off
once they got out to sea.

09:59.866 --> 10:03.735
I believe the details they gave
us were intentionally fuzzy.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.772
I... Um...

10:07.774 --> 10:09.908
We-we can, um...
(cell phone ringing)

10:09.910 --> 10:12.744
We... Can...

10:12.746 --> 10:14.913
Abbs.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.247
Gibbs, can you meet me
in the lab?

10:16.249 --> 10:19.150
Sure. I'll be right down.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.786
Nice work, tim.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.624
New look, abbs?

10:25.626 --> 10:29.060
Sir arthur conan doyle
would be intrigued by this...

10:29.062 --> 10:30.362
Transmogrification.

10:30.364 --> 10:32.097
I was inspired
by actual events, gibbs.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.232
What do you got?
I've got a
flimflam, gibbs.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.800
A hoodwink.
It's the old switcheroo.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.068
We've been bamboozled.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.204
Allow me to
translate, jethro.

10:39.206 --> 10:43.041
The body in autopsy is
not who we thought he was.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.109
It's not parsa's bodyguard?

10:44.111 --> 10:45.343
Our victim

10:45.345 --> 10:47.646
Is a port authority officer

10:47.648 --> 10:49.214
Named alex rio.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.949
Ducky:
Yes, I identified him

10:50.951 --> 10:54.786
Through a serial number
from his right knee prosthetic.

10:54.788 --> 10:58.023
And the clothing that rio
was wearing-- it wasn't his.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.724
These did belong,
however,

10:59.726 --> 11:01.693
To the mysterious bodyguard.

11:01.695 --> 11:02.994
I found a piece of paper

11:02.996 --> 11:05.864
With arabic lettering
in his trouser pocket.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.432
Body was staged.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.801
Yeah, and here's where it
gets really interesting.

11:09.803 --> 11:12.370
The pants
that officer rio was wearing

11:12.372 --> 11:14.939
Had a bullet hole
in the left leg,

11:14.941 --> 11:16.908
But there was no corresponding
wound on the victim.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.143
Meaning that the bodyguard
was shot in the leg

11:18.145 --> 11:19.444
Before he switched clothes.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.012
And needed
medical attention.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.213
There's no way
he could travel

11:22.215 --> 11:23.982
With that kind of injury,

11:23.984 --> 11:26.051
Especially across
international waters.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.086
He could still be in country.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.155
That's great work.

11:30.157 --> 11:34.092
It was elementary,
my dear gibbs.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.694
Alex rio's been
working security

11:35.696 --> 11:38.029
For the port
authority since 2009.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.699
Boss said he hadn't been seen
since his shift last week.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.068
Most likely when he stumbled
onto parsa and his bodyguard,

11:43.070 --> 11:44.903
Tried to intervene
and got himself killed.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.138
Not before he got a shot off.

11:47.140 --> 11:50.742
Bishop:
I contacted all hospitals within
a ten-mile radius of the port.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.143
West park had
a john doe admitted

11:52.145 --> 11:54.045
For a gunshot wound
to the thigh,

11:54.047 --> 11:55.947
But patient took off
before police questioned him.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.016
Mcgee:
He's also been using
rio's credit cards.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.018
Last charge was to a
motel in chesapeake.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.153
Front desk said he checked
out a few hours ago.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.888
(phone rings)
yeah, it's gibbs.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.157
It's marlens. Can you meet me
in the park out front?

12:06.159 --> 12:08.026
Yeah. Yeah, I'll
meet you there.

12:09.428 --> 12:11.129
Mcgee, I want to
know when another

12:11.131 --> 12:12.797
Charge is made on that card.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.232
You got it.

12:15.868 --> 12:17.502
Marlens:
Can't say I was surprised
to get your call.

12:17.504 --> 12:20.839
I saw it coming after I heard
you assigned bishop to parsa.

12:20.841 --> 12:23.408
Care to shed a little light
on that for me?
You know I can't

12:23.410 --> 12:25.810
Divulge any specific
nsa operational details

12:25.812 --> 12:30.181
Don't be specific, but you got
to give me something, marlens.

12:30.183 --> 12:33.118
Come on. I know this is
more than a case to her.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.886
Just trying
to protect my people.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.154
You can understand that.

12:36.156 --> 12:39.023
Why do you
think I'm here?

12:41.193 --> 12:43.962
When bishop first started
at nsa,

12:43.964 --> 12:46.831
She was a deployed analyst
assigned to the middle east.

12:46.833 --> 12:49.434
Her mission was
preemptive terror analysis--

12:49.436 --> 12:54.072
To predict and pinpoint who
the up-and-coming players were.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.908
She was the first to ding
benham parsa as a threat.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.076
How close she get?

12:58.078 --> 12:59.778
Almost caught him
a few times.

12:59.780 --> 13:03.047
But, uh...
Her near-misses just...

13:03.049 --> 13:05.216
Made her more determined.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.285
Well, you work with her,
you know how she is.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.053
She doesn't quit.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.922
Which means she was pulled
from the assignment.

13:10.924 --> 13:13.391
Reassigned.
Why?

13:13.393 --> 13:14.993
Nsa felt it was
in her best interest.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.427
And that's really all
I can say about it.

13:16.429 --> 13:19.130
Look, gibbs, if you really want
to look out for bishop,

13:19.132 --> 13:21.266
Distance her
from the parsa case.

13:21.268 --> 13:25.804
The deeper you let her get,
the more harm you're doing.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.015
Just calling you, boss.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.983
Charge popped up on
rio's stolen credit card

13:38.985 --> 13:40.285
For a flight to miami

13:40.287 --> 13:42.420
Departing from norfolk airport
in two hours.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.989
Parsa's network has connections
in miami.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.324
Makes sense his
bodyguard would go there.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.026
Okay, let's go.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.095
No, no, not you.

13:53.232 --> 13:55.233
Gibbs, I can't just...
I'm... (scoffs)

13:55.235 --> 13:56.568
You're riding a desk.

13:58.404 --> 14:01.105
Have a seat, bishop.

14:03.142 --> 14:04.943
(sighs)

14:04.945 --> 14:08.046
Woman (over speaker):
The transportation
security administration

14:08.048 --> 14:09.514
Has limited the size
and quantity of items

14:09.516 --> 14:13.117
That may be carried
through the security checkpoint.

14:13.119 --> 14:16.154
No liquids beyond
the security checkpoint.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.389
Please contact your air carrier
for a tsa...

14:18.391 --> 14:20.024
Alex rio?

14:21.961 --> 14:23.394
You look really good
for a dead guy.

14:26.298 --> 14:28.299
Ncis. Hi, there.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.035
Got it, boss.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.303
Get it to abby
for dna.

14:34.940 --> 14:37.108
Okay, let this be a lesson
to everyone here.

14:37.110 --> 14:40.578
When we say "no liquids
past this point," we mean it.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.088
Gibbs:
Where's benham parsa?

14:50.090 --> 14:51.923
Only met the guy
a few weeks ago.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.958
He hired me to provide security.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.927
Don't know where he is.

14:55.929 --> 14:58.630
We pulled your dna
from the water bottle, khalil.

14:58.632 --> 15:01.132
Parsa isn't just
your employer.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.367
He's your cousin.

15:04.536 --> 15:07.205
Tell me where he is.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.240
Or what?

15:09.242 --> 15:11.209
Intimidation tactics?

15:11.211 --> 15:13.511
Threats? Torture?

15:13.513 --> 15:15.213
They're all good ideas.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.481
And all pointless.

15:18.317 --> 15:20.652
You think I would turn
on my family?

15:20.654 --> 15:22.220
My blood?

15:22.222 --> 15:25.156
You don't know
what true loyalty is.

15:25.158 --> 15:28.092
Your blood left you behind
to save his own ass.

15:28.094 --> 15:30.094
His loyalty is one-sided.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.697
Family is a complicated thing.

15:37.403 --> 15:39.203
Hey, we need to talk.

15:42.474 --> 15:44.208
This is the men's room, bishop.

15:44.210 --> 15:46.644
I know. I'm waiting for you.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.112
(sighs)

15:48.114 --> 15:50.114
How did you know
when I'd be in here?

15:50.116 --> 15:51.549
Every two hours, like clockwork.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.685
(zipping)

15:53.687 --> 15:56.454
(chuckles)
all right.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.690
We're gonna need to establish
some personal boundaries.

15:58.692 --> 16:00.525
How long have you been working
with gibbs?

16:00.527 --> 16:02.460
Ah.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.996
Yeah. Well,

16:04.998 --> 16:07.231
We go way back.
It was a simpler time.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.300
Rebecca romijn
was still stamos-ed.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.269
Angelina jolie was
kissing her brother,

16:11.271 --> 16:13.738
And russell crowe
brought back the caesar.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.474
I really miss that one.
It framed my face pretty good.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.177
How long did it take
you to figure him out?

16:19.179 --> 16:20.378
Gibbs?
Mm-hmm.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.213
Any day now.

16:23.582 --> 16:25.516
You'll pick up a few cues
here and there,

16:25.518 --> 16:27.118
But don't expect an answer key.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.753
How do I convince him

16:28.755 --> 16:30.655
He's making a mistake
benching me?

16:30.657 --> 16:33.157
Well, for starters,
I wouldn't use the "m" word.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.759
I'm just stating
the facts.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.594
I mean,
whether he likes it or not,

16:36.596 --> 16:38.196
I know more about parsa
than anyone.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.498
I should be in there
questioning his cousin.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.201
First, he tells us
parsa is priority number one.

16:43.203 --> 16:46.237
Then he cuts me out
when I make progress.

16:46.239 --> 16:49.173
What game is he playing?
Gibbs doesn't play games.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.242
Except for twister.
That's been confirmed.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.777
(sighs)

16:52.779 --> 16:55.613
But you're the one
not showing him your full hand.

16:55.615 --> 16:58.249
I've done everything he's asked.

16:59.518 --> 17:00.685
What more does he need?

17:00.687 --> 17:04.322
Gibbs doesn't expect that
you'll tell him everything.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.059
But he needs to trust
that you would.

17:08.061 --> 17:11.162
(door opens)

17:11.164 --> 17:14.032
Tony, you seen bish...?

17:14.034 --> 17:15.700
Hey.
Hey.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.370
What's going on?

17:19.372 --> 17:21.205
Little bathroom campfire.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.174
Oh.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.575
Nsa dropped this off
for you.

17:25.677 --> 17:27.779
What is operation street sweep?

17:27.781 --> 17:29.447
Our leverage.

17:32.284 --> 17:33.751
Are you sure about this intel?

17:33.753 --> 17:38.189
Let's see what he's willing
to risk to protect his cousin.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.525
Our 48-hour window
is down to 24.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.794
I know you may not trust me,

17:42.796 --> 17:45.129
But I'm asking you
to trust my instincts.

17:49.535 --> 17:51.569
Where do you live in pakistan?

17:51.571 --> 17:53.104
Karachi.

17:53.106 --> 17:56.307
I would have guessed
the village of sharbaga.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.111
Ever hear of

18:00.113 --> 18:03.147
The pakistani sanitation
partnership, khalil?

18:03.149 --> 18:05.083
It's a program that organizes

18:05.085 --> 18:08.152
The residential waste management
services throughout pakistan.

18:08.154 --> 18:09.320
Your government believes

18:09.322 --> 18:10.588
It's run by a local
environmental group.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.557
In reality, it's run by the cia.

18:12.559 --> 18:13.624
Designed to create

18:13.626 --> 18:15.326
An extensive dna catalogue

18:15.328 --> 18:17.795
To track terrorists through
their familial connections.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.730
So, we ran your dna

18:19.732 --> 18:22.667
Through the system
and found a match.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.368
Three, to be exact.

18:26.805 --> 18:28.206
How are your sons doing?

18:29.508 --> 18:31.209
Do you want to keep them safe,
khalil?

18:31.211 --> 18:32.376
Don't threaten my family!

18:32.378 --> 18:33.544
Sit down!

18:43.755 --> 18:46.691
You're the one that
put them at risk.

18:47.726 --> 18:49.360
Bishop:
Our intel confirms

18:49.362 --> 18:51.395
Benham parsa is with
your family in sharbaga.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.898
Drone strike has
already been ordered.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.867
Your information is wrong!

18:55.869 --> 18:58.402
He is not with my family!

18:58.404 --> 19:00.371
Parsa is more
important to you

19:00.373 --> 19:02.306
Than you protecting
your own children?

19:12.384 --> 19:14.218
Where is he?

19:16.288 --> 19:20.391
He has a compound in mingora

19:20.393 --> 19:22.460
Off of bahrain road.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.495
Near the
gunbad graveyard,

19:24.497 --> 19:26.564
Where his parents are buried.

19:29.801 --> 19:31.502
Man:
Recon satellite images show

19:31.504 --> 19:33.337
The compound has
limited access points.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.773
Our ground intel puts
six individuals inside.

19:35.775 --> 19:39.477
How certain can you be
that this is parsa's compound?

19:39.479 --> 19:41.245
Well, from a tactical
standpoint,

19:41.247 --> 19:43.548
The structure fits the bill.
It's surrounded

19:43.550 --> 19:46.350
By ten-foot walls with barbed
wire, two security gates.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.552
Blackened windows
for limited visibility,

19:47.554 --> 19:49.253
And no telephone connection.

19:49.255 --> 19:50.555
Just like bin laden.

19:50.557 --> 19:51.889
Hmm. Are we working
in conjunction

19:51.891 --> 19:53.457
With the pakistani government?

19:53.459 --> 19:56.327
Negative. There's also
the possibility

19:56.329 --> 19:58.429
Of external forces
complicating matters.

19:58.431 --> 20:01.933
Swat district is still
a stronghold for the taliban.

20:01.935 --> 20:03.467
What are the
mission parameters?

20:03.469 --> 20:05.269
With favorable
weather conditions

20:05.271 --> 20:06.437
And a moonless night projected,

20:06.439 --> 20:08.506
A seal squad led
by lieutenant blake will

20:08.508 --> 20:10.508
Make an approach via
two black hawk helos.

20:10.510 --> 20:11.475
Lieutenant?

20:11.477 --> 20:12.877
Yes, sir.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.546
York one will circle
over the perimeter

20:15.548 --> 20:18.549
With squad alpha providing
outward security.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.586
York two will infil squad bravo
and myself into the courtyard,

20:21.588 --> 20:23.654
Where we will breach
the compound

20:23.656 --> 20:25.957
And assault from the ground up.

20:25.959 --> 20:27.725
Once jackpot is secure,
we will exfil

20:27.727 --> 20:29.627
Back to the uss <i>wilmington.</i>

20:29.629 --> 20:31.462
What's the operational
time frame?

20:31.464 --> 20:33.664
Infil to exfil
in less than 20 mikes.

20:33.666 --> 20:34.832
Keep your team
at the ready.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.234
Hooyah, sir.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.902
Thank you, admiral.

20:42.608 --> 20:45.009
Tony:
Hey.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.510
What's going on with you?

20:46.512 --> 20:47.612
I don't want to talk about it.

20:47.614 --> 20:50.548
Oh, ho, ho. Say no more.

20:50.550 --> 20:54.285
I'm hearing you
loud and clear.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.520
You want someone
to talk to?

20:56.522 --> 20:58.789
That's the exact opposite
of what I said.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.892
Come on, mcgee.
Lean on me.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.462
No, thank you, tony.

21:04.464 --> 21:07.932
Sometimes it helps to
have somebody to talk to,

21:07.934 --> 21:12.036
And... Believe it or not,
I can be a good listener.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.573
All right.

21:15.575 --> 21:17.541
It's delilah.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.310
I want to update her on parsa

21:19.312 --> 21:20.745
And tell her
about the raid, but...

21:20.747 --> 21:22.880
You don't want her
to get her hopes up

21:22.882 --> 21:24.515
In case it
doesn't pan out.

21:24.517 --> 21:25.983
Exactly.
Hmm.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.485
We've gotten close
to catching him before,

21:27.487 --> 21:29.487
And he slipped
through our fingers.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.489
Now we're on his turf, he's got
the home-court advantage.

21:31.491 --> 21:35.760
True... But that makes
us the away team.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.528
The scrappy
underdogs.

21:37.530 --> 21:40.631
The band of misfits
with something to prove.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.834
Parsa may be apollo
creed, but...

21:43.836 --> 21:46.771
We're rocky balboa.

21:46.773 --> 21:48.539
Rocky lost to apollo.

21:48.541 --> 21:49.807
But he won the rematch.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.676
And that's what this is.

21:52.644 --> 21:54.045
Feel better?

21:54.047 --> 21:56.447
Yeah, actually, I do.
Thanks, tony.

21:56.449 --> 22:00.651
I'll be the paulie to your
italian stallion any day.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.586
Gibbs:
Dinozzo, mcgee.

22:02.588 --> 22:05.423
Mtac. Where's bishop?
Haven't seen her
since she left interrogation.

22:05.425 --> 22:07.692
I could check
the men's room.
Gibbs: No.

22:07.694 --> 22:08.959
Go on. I got it.

22:16.835 --> 22:20.438
Surprised I'm not sitting
front row, center in mtac?

22:20.440 --> 22:22.773
No. I figured
you'd be here.

22:22.775 --> 22:27.578
I've waited six years
for this.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.847
So, why am I hiding down here?

22:29.849 --> 22:32.550
Catching parsa, bishop,

22:32.552 --> 22:34.585
Only ends the chase.

22:34.587 --> 22:37.021
It doesn't erase
the damage he's done.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.623
Damage I could have prevented.

22:39.625 --> 22:41.025
(sighs)

22:41.027 --> 22:42.927
I should have stopped him
sooner.

22:48.533 --> 22:51.001
Parsa made contact with me.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.572
A few years ago, he...

22:54.574 --> 22:57.641
He found out who I was,

22:57.643 --> 22:59.810
Tracked me down.

22:59.812 --> 23:02.613
Started leaving things
for me to find.

23:02.615 --> 23:06.016
Clues, taunts.

23:06.018 --> 23:08.886
Gifts. (laughs)

23:08.888 --> 23:12.723
Just his way of reminding me
that he was watching, too.

23:14.693 --> 23:16.594
The chess moves I talk about?

23:18.063 --> 23:20.464
Who do you think
taught me the game?

23:22.167 --> 23:25.136
You withheld that from the nsa.

23:25.138 --> 23:27.872
I knew they'd pull me
if they found out,

23:27.874 --> 23:30.841
Which... They did.

23:30.843 --> 23:33.677
But I thought,
if I played parsa's game,

23:33.679 --> 23:36.614
He'd eventually
slip up and...

23:36.616 --> 23:38.582
I'd get the upper hand.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.919
You spend years
studying someone,

23:41.921 --> 23:45.823
Learning everything
about them, you...

23:47.659 --> 23:49.493
...You begin to humanize them.

23:49.495 --> 23:51.028
No, that's parsa's play.

23:51.030 --> 23:54.498
He lets you inside
his head so...

23:54.500 --> 23:56.534
He can get inside yours.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.502
Well, it worked.

23:58.504 --> 24:01.439
I started to see the man,

24:01.441 --> 24:03.574
Not just the monster.

24:03.576 --> 24:05.709
They're one and
the same, kid.

24:05.711 --> 24:09.513
You really want to put an end
to parsa's game?

24:09.515 --> 24:11.048
Make your move.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.683
That's it?

24:12.685 --> 24:14.819
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

24:14.821 --> 24:17.188
Rule number 11--

24:17.190 --> 24:19.557
When the job is done...

24:19.559 --> 24:21.725
Walk away.

24:25.697 --> 24:28.632
Blake:
One mike to target.

24:28.634 --> 24:29.633
They're on final approach.

24:29.635 --> 24:31.836
Any pakistani chatter?
Nothing.

24:31.838 --> 24:33.771
Bravo squad, weapons check.

24:37.943 --> 24:41.946
Passing phase line delta.
Flare shows no contacts.

24:43.882 --> 24:47.251
Bravo squad,
stand by for doors open.

24:48.086 --> 24:49.887
Go! Go! Go!

24:53.592 --> 24:55.626
Bravo, keep containment.

24:55.628 --> 24:57.061
Switch to helmet cam.

25:09.708 --> 25:12.042
(groaning)

25:13.011 --> 25:14.278
Outside clear.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.547
Open door right. Go! Go! Go!

25:16.549 --> 25:19.149
(indistinct shouting)

25:19.151 --> 25:21.085
(rapid gunfire)

25:22.220 --> 25:23.621
Clear!

25:23.623 --> 25:25.623
All clear!

25:25.625 --> 25:27.725
Right side is breached.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.226
Hallway, moving.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.095
All clear.

25:33.131 --> 25:34.231
(yelling)

25:34.233 --> 25:37.001
(gunfire)

25:37.003 --> 25:39.703
Breacher hit.
We've got a man down.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.038
Man down!

25:41.040 --> 25:44.775
(rapid gunfire)

25:51.850 --> 25:53.851
Blake:
Repeat, breacher down.

25:53.853 --> 25:54.785
Breacher down!

25:54.787 --> 25:57.788
(gunfire, yelling)

25:57.790 --> 25:59.623
Clear.
Vance: Bring up
seal camera three.

25:59.625 --> 26:02.693
Roger that. Camera three.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.595
All clear.

26:04.597 --> 26:06.163
Stairway.

26:07.265 --> 26:08.933
Hold left.

26:08.935 --> 26:10.834
Clear.

26:10.836 --> 26:12.870
Open door, right.

26:13.805 --> 26:15.005
(yells in pashto)

26:15.007 --> 26:16.206
Drop the weapon!

26:16.208 --> 26:18.976
(gunshot, man groans)

26:18.978 --> 26:20.344
Secure.

26:23.048 --> 26:24.882
Pick him up.

26:24.884 --> 26:26.650
On your feet.

26:26.652 --> 26:27.818
Stand up!

26:30.322 --> 26:32.923
All stations, confirmed--
jackpot.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.725
Target is secure.

26:34.727 --> 26:37.227
Commence sse.
Five mikes to exfil.

26:39.998 --> 26:41.899
Not over yet, gibbs.

26:41.901 --> 26:43.334
We cut the head off one snake.

26:43.336 --> 26:44.835
There's still a whole
nest out there.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.637
What are secnav's orders?

26:46.639 --> 26:48.839
Now that we have parsa,
press him for intel.

26:48.841 --> 26:50.975
Enough to disable his
entire terrorist network.

26:50.977 --> 26:53.611
How hard?
Whatever it takes.

27:06.057 --> 27:07.791
Special agent gibbs.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.193
How's your man, lieutenant?

27:09.195 --> 27:11.061
Easy day.
He's seen worse.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.830
What's parsa's condition?

27:12.832 --> 27:14.865
Sustained a gunshot
wound to the shoulder,

27:14.867 --> 27:16.066
Intentionally
through-and-through.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.368
Doc patched him up.

27:17.370 --> 27:18.836
He say anything?

27:18.838 --> 27:21.238
Only to refuse antibiotics
and painkillers.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.674
Parsa doesn't believe
in an altered mental state.

27:23.676 --> 27:25.075
Always has to feel
in control.

27:25.077 --> 27:26.910
Well, we're in
control now, ma'am.

27:26.912 --> 27:28.946
He's in a brig
holding cell.

27:28.948 --> 27:32.383
Got a guard in with him and
another one posted outside.

27:34.319 --> 27:36.320
First class,
that's it.
Right, sir.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.155
We set you up
in here.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.957
You've got eyes in his cell,

27:39.959 --> 27:41.925
As well as everything
confiscated from the compound,

27:41.927 --> 27:43.827
Including his laptop.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.295
He have anything on him?

27:45.297 --> 27:47.031
Just this.

27:48.933 --> 27:50.868
Bishop?

27:53.104 --> 27:54.304
It's his parents.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.008
Mcgee, I want everything
on that computer.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.076
Where's the brig?

27:59.078 --> 28:01.145
This way.
What about me?

28:01.147 --> 28:03.847
You do what you do,
bishop-- analyze.

28:09.187 --> 28:11.789
Special agent gibbs.

28:11.791 --> 28:14.024
My first visitor.

28:14.026 --> 28:17.227
They say you always
remember your first.

28:19.030 --> 28:21.965
You're lucky.
Lucky is getting shot?

28:21.967 --> 28:24.368
No, you're lucky
you didn't get shot by me,

28:24.370 --> 28:26.737
Because I wouldn't have shot you
in the shoulder.

28:26.739 --> 28:28.972
And what's stopping you
from shooting me now?

28:28.974 --> 28:30.708
Not much.

28:30.710 --> 28:33.877
You're a smart man,
not a reckless one.

28:33.879 --> 28:36.480
Kill me, and you won't get
the answers you came for.

28:36.482 --> 28:39.216
Yeah, well, I'd get over that.

28:39.218 --> 28:42.453
I'm a smart man, too.

28:42.455 --> 28:44.288
That is why I will
fully cooperate

28:44.290 --> 28:46.757
And tell you what
you want to know.

28:46.759 --> 28:49.193
Under one condition.
Hey!

28:49.195 --> 28:51.361
I am not here to negotiate
with you.

28:52.797 --> 28:54.998
Well, think of what
you get in return.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.900
Names of those in
my organization,

28:56.902 --> 28:59.970
Locations of
our operations,

28:59.972 --> 29:01.371
Future targets.

29:01.373 --> 29:02.906
Yeah, well,

29:02.908 --> 29:05.242
If it sounds too good
to be true...

29:05.244 --> 29:07.010
I'd rather destroy

29:07.012 --> 29:08.378
What I've spent years building

29:08.380 --> 29:11.849
Than watch someone else
have control of it.

29:14.085 --> 29:16.153
This is what
I'm willing to give you.

29:16.955 --> 29:19.022
What do you get?

29:23.928 --> 29:26.196
A conversation.

29:29.000 --> 29:32.136
I have unfinished business
with nsa analyst

29:32.138 --> 29:34.171
Eleanor bishop.

29:42.147 --> 29:44.848
Abby?

29:44.850 --> 29:46.150
Abby, you there?

29:46.152 --> 29:47.951
Mcgee! What's going on?

29:47.953 --> 29:50.254
I need an update.
Did you see parsa?

29:50.256 --> 29:52.022
Is gibbs staring him
into submission?

29:52.024 --> 29:54.024
Oh, that's a good visual.

29:54.026 --> 29:55.826
Abby...
Hold on.

29:55.828 --> 29:58.295
Okay, gibbs has him
right where he wants him.

30:00.064 --> 30:03.033
And it's gibbs for the win! Ah!

30:03.035 --> 30:04.968
Abby...
Okay, I'm back.

30:04.970 --> 30:07.471
To what do I owe
this transatlantic chat?

30:07.473 --> 30:10.841
Well, I'm trying to decrypt
the files on parsa's laptop,

30:10.843 --> 30:13.811
And I need an extra set
of very skilled fingers.

30:13.813 --> 30:16.146
I have ten ready to go.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.148
Right.
Sending you the files now.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.216
Thanks, abbs.

30:25.023 --> 30:26.356
Eleanor.

30:26.358 --> 30:28.892
Sit down.

30:36.134 --> 30:38.101
(groans)

30:42.941 --> 30:44.041
Benham.

30:44.043 --> 30:47.177
You're looking well.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.581
You look like hell.

30:50.583 --> 30:52.382
(laughs)

30:52.384 --> 30:54.184
Will you reconsider
taking the medicine?

30:54.186 --> 30:56.553
You know I cannot.

30:56.555 --> 31:01.191
But it's nice
to know you care.

31:03.294 --> 31:06.230
At least eat something.

31:06.232 --> 31:08.265
We're going to be here a while.

31:08.267 --> 31:10.100
(laughs)

31:10.102 --> 31:12.135
My favorite.

31:12.137 --> 31:14.171
You remembered.

31:15.473 --> 31:18.475
It's your turn, benham.

31:24.349 --> 31:27.618
The main base of operations
is in peshawar.

31:27.620 --> 31:30.621
You'll find most of
my inner circle there.

31:30.623 --> 31:33.156
First in line is fu'ad hansur,

31:33.158 --> 31:36.260
Former al-shabaab
militant.

31:37.095 --> 31:38.996
How many targets
are you vetting?

31:38.998 --> 31:41.265
In your country or...

31:41.267 --> 31:43.200
Worldwide?

31:43.202 --> 31:45.402
Both.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.907
(grunts)

31:49.909 --> 31:51.141
Benham.

31:54.212 --> 31:55.479
Six.

31:58.683 --> 32:00.083
Agent gibbs,

32:00.085 --> 32:01.418
An agent dinozzo is
calling for you

32:01.420 --> 32:04.354
On the vtc.

32:15.466 --> 32:17.167
Take the call.

32:17.169 --> 32:19.269
I can handle this.
Not happening, bishop.

32:19.271 --> 32:22.272
If parsa stops talking,
he might not start again.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.541
We can't risk missing
out on the intel.

32:24.543 --> 32:27.210
He is in handcuffs,
nursing a gunshot wound,

32:27.212 --> 32:28.578
And there's an armed guard.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.247
I'm not leaving you
alone with him.

32:30.249 --> 32:32.015
It's the final move
on the chessboard.

32:32.017 --> 32:33.550
Let me do this, please.

32:37.221 --> 32:40.157
If he sneezes, shoot him.

32:40.159 --> 32:42.259
You can
ask questions later.

32:44.462 --> 32:46.730
(exhales)

32:48.499 --> 32:50.500
Tony:
<i>This connection must be bad.</i>

32:50.502 --> 32:53.236
It sounded like you said parsa
was being cooperative.

32:53.238 --> 32:54.638
He is.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.306
Am I the only one
who finds that strange?

32:56.308 --> 32:57.507
No.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.009
Oh, hey, boss. How's it going?

32:59.011 --> 33:00.377
You called me, dinozzo.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.212
Right. Well, abby tracked down

33:02.214 --> 33:04.181
The financial backers
funding parsa's operation.

33:04.183 --> 33:05.282
Abby:
I did.

33:05.284 --> 33:06.750
And guess what, gibbs.

33:06.752 --> 33:09.619
Half of parsa's bankroll
came from two

33:09.621 --> 33:12.222
Government-contracted
u.S. Corporations.

33:12.224 --> 33:14.257
Tony:
I already briefed vance.
He's updating sec now.

33:14.259 --> 33:16.259
Mcgee:
Boss, we got a
bigger problem.

33:16.261 --> 33:17.494
I just decrypted a file

33:17.496 --> 33:20.030
That was a catalogue
for surveillance photos,

33:20.032 --> 33:21.531
Date- and time-stamped
over the last two years.

33:21.533 --> 33:22.766
What's the target?

33:22.768 --> 33:25.302
It's not what-- it's who.

33:30.541 --> 33:33.210
What's after
philadelphia?

33:35.380 --> 33:37.280
What's the next target?

33:39.250 --> 33:40.517
Benham?

33:43.788 --> 33:46.089
Sorry.

33:48.159 --> 33:51.028
We need a corpsman
down here now!

33:52.296 --> 33:53.563
(bishop grunts)

33:55.566 --> 33:57.200
(alarm blaring)

33:57.202 --> 34:00.103
Man (over speaker):
Security alert. Security alert.

34:00.105 --> 34:03.073
Shots fired in the brig.

34:03.075 --> 34:04.374
Security alert.

34:04.376 --> 34:07.377
All hands not involved,
stand back.

34:09.180 --> 34:12.249
(groaning)

34:19.057 --> 34:21.291
(grunting)

34:32.503 --> 34:35.072
Man:
This brig door's built to stop
people from breaking out,

34:35.074 --> 34:37.240
Not from trying
to stay in.
How long?

34:37.242 --> 34:39.543
To cut through three-inch-thick
steel? 20, 30 minutes?

34:39.545 --> 34:41.545
No, you got to be
faster than that.

34:41.547 --> 34:43.380
Blow the damn thing
if you have to.

34:43.382 --> 34:45.315
Parsa:
You all right?

34:45.317 --> 34:47.517
Better than the two sailors
you just killed.

34:47.519 --> 34:50.587
Casualties of war, I'm afraid.

34:53.091 --> 34:56.426
I just wanted us to finish
our conversation in private.

34:56.428 --> 34:59.262
It's been a long time, eleanor.

34:59.264 --> 35:01.598
I've thought about you.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.733
You should have stopped
by the office,

35:03.735 --> 35:05.268
Said hello.

35:05.270 --> 35:08.405
(chuckles)
that's too formal.

35:08.407 --> 35:11.241
I much prefer your
apartment in dc.

35:11.243 --> 35:14.744
How is your
husband, uh, jake?

35:14.746 --> 35:17.681
He should really learn
to watch his surroundings.

35:17.683 --> 35:18.682
Stop, benham.

35:18.684 --> 35:22.219
My husband
isn't your play.

35:22.221 --> 35:23.653
So what is?

35:23.655 --> 35:28.225
Use me as a hostage?
Make a trade for your freedom?

35:28.227 --> 35:29.726
It won't work.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.661
Man:
Hold on! Hold on!
Got to get through!

35:31.663 --> 35:34.197
Bishop:
You're not getting
off this ship.

35:34.199 --> 35:35.332
Hostage?

35:35.334 --> 35:37.601
Is that what you
think you are?

35:37.603 --> 35:39.336
You know me better than that.

35:39.338 --> 35:41.738
This isn't an escape attempt.

35:46.210 --> 35:47.744
Vance: How much longer
until they can breach the door?

35:47.746 --> 35:49.646
Too long.
Any eyes inside?

35:49.648 --> 35:51.581
Parsa's taken out both
security cameras. We're blind.

35:51.583 --> 35:52.816
Marlens, any idea

35:52.818 --> 35:53.817
What his plan is?

35:53.819 --> 35:55.819
Parsa's actions towards bishop

35:55.821 --> 35:58.388
In the past
has always been psychological.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.757
He was trying to make some
sort of a connection with her

36:00.759 --> 36:02.459
To get her to
understand him.

36:05.329 --> 36:07.864
I need nsa's
recorded phone calls

36:07.866 --> 36:09.699
Between parsa and his sister.

36:09.701 --> 36:11.501
Any that mention their parents.

36:11.503 --> 36:12.702
What's the play, gibbs?

36:12.704 --> 36:14.337
Take a page out
of bishop's book.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.239
We're going to hit parsa
where it hurts-- his family.

36:18.309 --> 36:21.244
There's one thing
I've always wanted to know.

36:21.246 --> 36:24.881
What made you single me
out all those years ago?

36:24.883 --> 36:26.683
How did you see
the path I'd take?

36:26.685 --> 36:29.252
It's the same answer
for how I tracked you down.

36:36.861 --> 36:39.262
It's always been about them.

36:39.264 --> 36:41.898
I singled you out
because I knew their deaths

36:41.900 --> 36:43.867
Left a void
that you couldn't fill.

36:43.869 --> 36:46.670
I saw a scared,
angry kid

36:46.672 --> 36:49.439
Who used violence
to mask his grief.

36:49.441 --> 36:52.509
It was never about money...

36:52.511 --> 36:53.843
Or religion.

36:55.613 --> 36:57.681
It was about not feeling alone.

36:57.683 --> 37:01.351
That's why you cause
death and destruction:

37:01.353 --> 37:03.720
To make others feel
the same pain you do.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.723
And I have succeeded.

37:07.758 --> 37:09.893
I took comfort
in knowing

37:09.895 --> 37:12.996
My parents were together
when they died.

37:15.933 --> 37:18.768
Don't be scared of the end,
eleanor.

37:20.771 --> 37:22.906
You won't be alone.

37:24.742 --> 37:28.278
Hayat (over speaker):
Benham, please, come home.

37:30.815 --> 37:31.848
H-hayat?

37:31.850 --> 37:33.717
Mother and father are gone.

37:33.719 --> 37:37.454
I love them as you do, but...
Nothing will bring them back.

37:37.456 --> 37:39.022
This is not what they
would have wanted.

37:39.024 --> 37:40.590
What is going on?

37:40.592 --> 37:42.459
Where is hayat?

37:42.461 --> 37:44.828
You are all I have left
in this world, brother.

37:44.830 --> 37:46.296
I cannot lose you.

37:46.298 --> 37:48.365
Promise you won't leave me.

37:48.367 --> 37:50.000
Listen to her, benham.

37:50.002 --> 37:52.002
You don't have
to die.

37:52.004 --> 37:53.436
Spare hayat the pain.

37:53.438 --> 37:56.773
My sister will
understand!

37:56.775 --> 38:00.343
She will honor me
as I have honored my parents.

38:00.345 --> 38:02.846
Benham, please.

38:03.714 --> 38:05.282
How will your family

38:05.284 --> 38:06.750
Honor you?

38:34.312 --> 38:36.846
Hey. Heading over
to delilah's?

38:36.848 --> 38:38.882
Yep. Movie night tonight.

38:38.884 --> 38:41.418
Had the sudden urge
to watch <i>rocky.</i>

38:41.420 --> 38:43.386
You interested?
Ah.

38:43.388 --> 38:45.822
That's very nice of you,
but I've got an overdue date

38:45.824 --> 38:47.490
With aphrodite's bath beads.

38:47.492 --> 38:48.892
You did good, kid.

38:48.894 --> 38:50.527
I second that.

38:50.529 --> 38:51.995
It was a team effort.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.963
Tony:
Bottom drawer, bishop.

38:53.965 --> 38:55.031
What?

38:55.033 --> 38:56.933
Bottom drawer.

38:58.969 --> 39:00.837
(chuckles)

39:26.731 --> 39:28.998
♪

39:36.941 --> 39:39.442
(groans)

39:40.911 --> 39:43.113
(groans)

39:45.416 --> 39:47.951
(groans)

39:47.953 --> 39:50.887
You're trying too hard.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.590
Didn't know
that was a bad thing.

39:53.592 --> 39:55.425
Practice makes perfect, right?

39:57.962 --> 40:00.397
It's about reading
the signs,

40:00.399 --> 40:02.966
Staying one step
ahead of the ball.

40:02.968 --> 40:04.033
That's your
problem, bishop.

40:04.035 --> 40:05.902
Stop trying to guess
what's coming.

40:07.905 --> 40:09.873
Wait for it.

40:09.875 --> 40:12.108
Trust your instincts.

40:16.013 --> 40:18.982
(sighs)

40:18.984 --> 40:20.116
(buzzer sounds)

40:20.118 --> 40:22.919
Anticipation doesn't
get you the win.

40:22.921 --> 40:27.090
It's how you react
to the situation.

40:27.092 --> 40:30.927
Guessing we're not talking
about my swing anymore, huh?

40:31.929 --> 40:34.030
You're catching on.

40:35.933 --> 40:38.935
You're not the easiest person
to read, you know.

40:38.937 --> 40:41.938
It's kind of
frustrating.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.707
Actually,
it's-it's really frustrating.

40:44.709 --> 40:46.976
Has anyone ever told you that
to your face?

40:49.046 --> 40:51.014
So, what are you really
doing here, agent gibbs?

40:51.016 --> 40:53.483
I gave you a job to do.

40:53.485 --> 40:55.785
You stepped up,
you saw it through.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.620
So is this praise?

40:57.622 --> 40:59.856
No, it's a standard, bishop.

40:59.858 --> 41:03.960
And I'll expect that out of you
every day you're an agent.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.095
Agent?

41:06.097 --> 41:07.964
Wait.
(chuckles)

41:07.966 --> 41:10.600
Are you offering me
a permanent job at ncis?

41:10.602 --> 41:11.901
Probationary.

41:11.903 --> 41:13.102
But you've earned it.

41:13.104 --> 41:16.105
If you're still up
for a challenge.

41:16.107 --> 41:19.476
Okay, um, before I
officially start working for you

41:19.478 --> 41:21.711
And this becomes frowned upon...

41:21.713 --> 41:25.014
(both chuckle)

41:28.018 --> 41:30.653
I accept... Boss.

41:32.256 --> 41:35.024
