00:21.147 --> 00:23.105
-Unbelievable.
-What's unbelievable?

00:23.232 --> 00:24.857
My skin? I've been moisturizing.

00:24.942 --> 00:27.901
I think dad's talking about
the gigantic stage they built

00:28.029 --> 00:29.945
In front of our restaurant
for the block party.

00:29.989 --> 00:31.447
-Oh.
-But nice skin, gene.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.699
-It's really shiny.
-Even on my heinie.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.993
They were supposed to build it
in front of mort's.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.911
We were gonna have
a perfect view of the stage.

00:37.997 --> 00:39.580
[teddy] I'll bet mort
pulled some strings.

00:39.665 --> 00:41.582
Embalmed all the right people.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.625
I was actually looking forward
to this block party.

00:43.711 --> 00:44.877
I like the soul breezers.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.837
Soul breezers?
Isn't that the wine cooler

00:46.922 --> 00:48.589
Mom complains
she can't find anymore?

00:48.716 --> 00:50.340
No, the soul breezers, the band.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.051
They've been around
since the '70s.

00:52.136 --> 00:54.428
Kind of inspiring that
they've been going that long.

00:54.513 --> 00:56.096
Even though they haven't had
a hit since back then.

00:56.182 --> 00:58.140
Well, they really only had
the one hit.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.559
-What was the hit?
-It was called "gas in my car."

01:06.609 --> 01:08.233
Also there was a gas crisis
back then,

01:08.360 --> 01:09.943
So it worked on a lot of levels.

01:10.071 --> 01:12.780
I only count one level.
Oh, wait, two. Nice.

01:12.865 --> 01:14.865
Well, I am in a crisis
right now, father.

01:14.909 --> 01:16.158
Our living room window
was supposed

01:16.285 --> 01:17.743
To look out onto the stage.

01:17.861 --> 01:19.995
The best seats in the house,
literally. And I sold tickets.

01:20.122 --> 01:21.413
You did what?

01:21.499 --> 01:23.040
Yeah, there are kids
who will pay good money

01:23.167 --> 01:24.833
To watch a free concert
from up there.

01:24.960 --> 01:26.418
-Three kids.
-Four if you count

01:26.504 --> 01:27.836
Andy and ollie
as separate people.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.797
Wait, why are kids
coming to our living room

01:29.882 --> 01:31.548
To see a band from the '70s?

01:31.592 --> 01:33.801
Dad, these are children who have
never seen a concert before.

01:33.886 --> 01:36.678
All I had to tell them was, the
higher above the stage you are,

01:36.806 --> 01:38.680
The more glorious
the experience.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.599
And that our living room
was gonna be like a luxury box,

01:40.684 --> 01:44.019
With unobstructed views at one
of the premier outdoor events

01:44.105 --> 01:45.437
To be held in our lifetimes.

01:45.564 --> 01:47.648
-The bidding was fierce.
-What'd you charge them?

01:47.733 --> 01:49.024
Let's just say they have candy,

01:49.110 --> 01:51.193
I have enamel
that needs to be dissolved.

01:51.278 --> 01:52.528
-We made an arrangement.
-Mm.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.488
And I'm helping out
in exchange for ten percent.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.532
Which means I get to bite off
ten percent

01:56.617 --> 01:57.825
Of each piece of candy.

01:57.868 --> 01:59.827
-Gross but fair.
-But now we're screwed.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.620
I just looked at the stage
from every window upstairs,

02:01.747 --> 02:04.790
And the only way you can see
at all is by squeezing your face

02:04.875 --> 02:06.208
Against the window
in gene's room

02:06.293 --> 02:08.335
And closing one eye
while you stand on tiptoe.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.587
It also helps to hold your
breath, or the glass fogs up.

02:10.673 --> 02:13.465
So, you have to close one eye
and not breathe.

02:13.509 --> 02:14.800
Sounds like a good time.

02:14.969 --> 02:16.593
Well, I'm gonna make
the most of today.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.679
I've always been one of those
people that claps at concerts--

02:18.764 --> 02:20.681
The two concerts
that I've been to,

02:20.766 --> 02:22.015
One of which
I stood outside of--

02:22.101 --> 02:23.934
But today I might try out
a whoo.

02:24.019 --> 02:25.102
-Whoo.
-Eh.

02:25.187 --> 02:26.728
-Whoo...?
-Hmm.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.772
-Whoo-oo-oo.
-Getting there?

02:28.899 --> 02:30.065
-Sort of.
-You know what?

02:30.151 --> 02:31.942
This-this will be good.

02:32.027 --> 02:32.985
We'll get a little
business maybe,

02:33.112 --> 02:34.862
And the soul breezers are great.

02:34.905 --> 02:36.572
And hearing them
but not seeing them

02:36.657 --> 02:37.906
Will be fine.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.491
Just like listening
to a record that's playing

02:39.577 --> 02:42.035
On speakers that are
facing away from us.

02:42.121 --> 02:43.620
Well, I'm mad
at the soul breezers.

02:43.706 --> 02:45.497
I know it's not their fault,
but I still am.

02:45.583 --> 02:47.624
-They're just too breezy.
-Hey. Don't mind me.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.668
I'm just grabbing some buns
for little king trashmouth.

02:49.795 --> 02:52.337
And a coffee. For me.
The king only drinks decaf.

02:52.423 --> 02:54.256
And wine.
Full-bodied reds.

02:54.383 --> 02:55.340
How's he doing?

02:55.426 --> 02:56.884
You've been out there
all morning.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.218
Yeah. I'm pretty sure
you love us

02:58.304 --> 02:59.803
More than that raccoon,
but sometimes I wonder.

02:59.889 --> 03:02.097
I'm okay with little king
trashmouth being her favorite.

03:02.141 --> 03:04.516
He has those expressive hands.
Like jeff goldblum.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.560
Oh, hush. Of course
I love you guys more.

03:06.729 --> 03:08.353
Pretty sure.
No, no, I do, I do.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.063
-Phew.
-The king's hanging in there.

03:10.149 --> 03:12.524
I don't know if his paw is
broken or sprained or what.

03:12.568 --> 03:15.110
Damn it, why didn't I study
to be a raccoon doctor?

03:15.237 --> 03:16.612
That world is so cutthroat.

03:16.655 --> 03:18.447
-Okay, I'm going back out.
-I'm gonna go with you.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.948
I don't want
little king trashmouth to think

03:20.075 --> 03:21.950
I only show up for him
during the good times.

03:22.036 --> 03:24.703
Well, we better go upstairs
to try to put some lipstick

03:24.863 --> 03:26.121
On this block party poop show.

03:26.248 --> 03:27.956
Figure out which pieces
of laundry in your room

03:28.125 --> 03:29.708
Are too terrible
to leave lying around.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.084
Not the ones you'd expect.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.377
Okay, just, everybody remember

03:32.504 --> 03:34.713
That we are also running
a restaurant today.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.131
Right? And I'm gonna
need some help

03:36.217 --> 03:37.549
-Because I don't know...
-[door opens, bell jingles]

03:37.635 --> 03:38.842
...How long
your mom's gonna be doing

03:38.969 --> 03:40.219
-Raccoon stuff.
-[door closes]

03:40.304 --> 03:42.221
-Tina, where are you going?
-To...

03:42.348 --> 03:44.014
Check on little king trashmouth?

03:44.099 --> 03:46.099
Okay, but you're
coming back, right?

03:46.185 --> 03:47.684
-Yup, yup, totally.
-Tina?

03:47.770 --> 03:49.186
Not the last you've seen
of old tina.

03:49.271 --> 03:50.812
[fake chuckle]
okay, bye.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.190
[sighs]
and then he was alone.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.442
-[purrs]
-[teddy groans]

03:55.527 --> 03:58.153
-Poor guy.
-Yeah, licking his hurt paw.

03:58.239 --> 04:00.072
I don't think
that's gonna fix it, king.

04:00.241 --> 04:01.782
He's sweet, but he's dumb.

04:01.825 --> 04:02.783
I saw him limp in there.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.034
I can't think of a sadder thing

04:04.161 --> 04:05.118
Than that little guy limping.

04:05.246 --> 04:06.578
Oh, I just thought of one.

04:06.622 --> 04:07.871
Ooh, I just thought
of another one.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.414
Ooh. Ooh, they're coming
fast and furious. Ooh.

04:09.541 --> 04:10.666
Hi, mr. Huggins.

04:10.793 --> 04:12.334
He's holding it together,
but he's hurting.

04:12.378 --> 04:14.378
-Where do you think gary is?
-I don't know.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.046
Off on one of his
raccoon business trips?

04:16.131 --> 04:17.714
I know they're not really
business trips,

04:17.800 --> 04:19.967
But that's what I call them
when he goes to other dumpsters.

04:20.052 --> 04:21.677
Well, hopefully
he comes back soon.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.971
Little king trashmouth needs
his support network right now.

04:24.098 --> 04:25.055
Who's gary, again?

04:25.140 --> 04:26.390
Little king trashmouth's
husband.

04:26.517 --> 04:28.100
Oh, crap.
I've been calling him greg.

04:28.185 --> 04:29.977
The names are close.
I'm sure he gets that a lot.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.812
Well, we got to help
this little guy.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.438
We got to stay focused.
You, too, king.

04:33.524 --> 04:36.441
Licking your paw.
Less licking, more kicking.

04:36.568 --> 04:37.651
-He gets it.
-Does he?

04:37.736 --> 04:39.194
He didn't like the buns.

04:39.363 --> 04:41.280
Should I get him soup?
That's nice when you're sick.

04:41.365 --> 04:43.490
No, I'm not gonna get him soup.

04:43.575 --> 04:44.658
I'll find something.
Oh, also, I'm gonna pee.

04:44.785 --> 04:45.909
-Okay, linda.
-Sounds good.

04:45.995 --> 04:47.536
Thanks for not peeing
in the alley.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.079
It's always nice
when someone down there

04:49.206 --> 04:50.455
Resists the temptation.

04:50.541 --> 04:53.542
One candy, two candy,
three candy.

04:53.669 --> 04:54.960
You, sir, are good to go.

04:55.087 --> 04:56.920
Also, you're early.
You're the first one here.

04:57.006 --> 04:58.505
But it's fine.
We can seat you now.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.757
Dad says you should
never miss the opener.

05:00.843 --> 05:02.426
They're the stars
of tomorrow, today.

05:02.553 --> 05:05.095
Besides, it's my first concert.
I'm so pumped.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.555
Yeah, well, it's gonna be great.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.974
-Right this way, sir.
-Ah, yes. Our usher.

05:09.059 --> 05:12.561
Welcome to the premium
platinum superfan suite,

05:12.646 --> 05:14.229
Aka rump-shakers' paradise.

05:14.398 --> 05:17.274
[rudy] huh. Can you see
the band at all from up here?

05:17.359 --> 05:18.734
Of course you can.
You just have to...

05:18.819 --> 05:21.903
Smush your face to the side
of the window, like so...

05:22.031 --> 05:22.946
-[grunts]
-see?

05:23.115 --> 05:24.239
-Oh.
-Right?

05:24.325 --> 05:25.240
Uh-huh.

05:25.367 --> 05:26.533
It's like you're
practically onstage.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.785
-I-I guess.
-Sometimes I nap like this.

05:28.912 --> 05:31.371
I'm back.
I got a pickle.

05:31.498 --> 05:32.873
Let's see
if raccoons like pickles.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.293
A pickle a day is, um,
good for raccoons?

05:36.337 --> 05:37.544
[linda]
also, I made a call.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.837
I felt like we should
bring in a professional

05:38.922 --> 05:40.339
To help out our little king.

05:40.466 --> 05:41.840
-Who'd you call?
-Animal control.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.175
I figure they'll know
what to do.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.010
Wait, you called animal control?

05:45.095 --> 05:46.178
-Yeah, why?
-What did you say to 'em?

05:46.305 --> 05:48.513
I just told them
about the hurt paw,

05:48.599 --> 05:50.349
And they asked if the animal
seemed lethargic,

05:50.476 --> 05:53.185
And I said, "yeah, kinda,
I mean his paw is hurt.

05:53.312 --> 05:54.686
-Wouldn't you be, too?"
-hmm.

05:54.772 --> 05:55.812
-What?
-Uh,

05:55.939 --> 05:57.564
Animal control isn't
who you call

05:57.649 --> 05:59.024
When you want to help an animal.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.318
They're more in the business
of<i> dealing</i> with animals.

06:01.403 --> 06:02.986
That's why
they call it "control."

06:03.113 --> 06:04.863
"dealing" with animals?
What do you mean?

06:04.990 --> 06:06.865
Like disciplining them?
Giving them time-outs?

06:06.950 --> 06:08.533
No, like...
[stifled groan]

06:08.577 --> 06:09.659
-Wait, what?!
-No.

06:09.787 --> 06:10.952
I think that's right, yeah.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.371
I've seen 'em on
<i> when animals attack!</i>

06:12.498 --> 06:13.997
-They have a lot of nets.
-[gasps]

06:14.124 --> 06:15.540
-And a lot of sticks
with the loops.
-[gasps]

06:15.667 --> 06:17.834
-And a lot
of tranquilizer darts.
-[gasps]

06:17.961 --> 06:20.045
And then the animal just goes
night-night.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.713
Wh-wh-why would they do that?

06:21.840 --> 06:23.882
Oh, my god. They said
they'd send someone right away.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.093
-Call back! Call back!
-[stammers]

06:26.220 --> 06:28.261
-[band playing]
-ooh. There's the first band.

06:28.347 --> 06:30.722
[weakly] whoo...
I'll-I'll work on it.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.311
Well, can't you just tell

06:36.397 --> 06:37.646
The animal control officers
not to come?

06:37.731 --> 06:38.939
I-I don't think
it was a raccoon.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.525
At all. Uh, I think
it was just a... A wig.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.693
Someone's old wig
shaking in the wind.

06:43.779 --> 06:46.613
What? No, you don't understand
how this works.

06:46.698 --> 06:48.448
Wait, don't hang up.
[groans]

06:48.575 --> 06:50.867
Why? Why...?

06:50.994 --> 06:52.452
How'd it go?

06:52.538 --> 06:53.286
It's happening.

06:53.372 --> 06:54.704
They say the truck's coming

06:54.832 --> 06:56.081
And she's not gonna
call them off.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.207
I can't believe it.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.625
I just signed
little king trashmouth's

06:58.710 --> 06:59.876
Frigging death warrant.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.211
And I'm like
his human godmother.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.922
And I love him.
Oh, I'm a bad person.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.507
Mom, there's got to be
something we can do.

07:05.634 --> 07:07.843
Oh, it's too late.
They're on their way.

07:07.970 --> 07:10.220
The king is dead.
Dead 'cause of me.

07:10.389 --> 07:12.013
No, no, no, linda,
don't be like that.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.348
We can, uh... We can catch

07:13.475 --> 07:14.891
Little king
trashmouth ourselves,

07:14.977 --> 07:16.726
-Before animal control
gets here.
-Wha...?

07:16.812 --> 07:19.438
If they can't find him,
they can't take him, right?

07:19.523 --> 07:20.522
Maybe, yeah?

07:20.607 --> 07:22.023
Well, then,
what are we waiting for?

07:22.151 --> 07:24.526
Maybe some training
on handling injured raccoons?

07:24.570 --> 07:26.361
So we don't get clawed
or, or bitten?

07:26.447 --> 07:28.438
A lot? No?
Yeah, it's probably fine.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.991
Hey, bob, I'm gonna get
a raccoon box from the basement.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.118
All right, I'll just take care
of everything in here.

07:33.245 --> 07:34.369
Ooh, can I order some fries?

07:34.496 --> 07:35.912
Ah, never mind,
I-I'll just smell 'em.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.914
-[sniffs] mmm.
-[door opens, bell jingles]

07:38.000 --> 07:39.833
Hi, welcome.
Here's a menu.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.710
I'll have, uh,
the burger of the day, please.

07:41.795 --> 07:42.836
Uh, okay, great.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.464
Sorry, uh, are you
with one of the bands?

07:45.632 --> 07:47.424
Yeah. The soul breezers.
How did you know?

07:47.509 --> 07:49.259
'cause you look
like a music guy.

07:49.386 --> 07:50.177
You have a hat.

07:50.304 --> 07:51.636
Well, thank you for noticing.

07:51.722 --> 07:53.004
I'm their road manager.
I'm ian.

07:53.098 --> 07:55.515
Oh, hi, I'm bob.
The soul breezers are great.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.435
I love their song.
I mean, their multiple songs.

07:58.562 --> 07:59.561
-That I know.
-Mm.

07:59.688 --> 08:01.021
Also, it's kind of amazing.

08:01.106 --> 08:02.439
After all these years,

08:02.524 --> 08:04.107
They're still out there
doing what they love.

08:04.193 --> 08:05.567
-It's inspiring.
-Ha.

08:05.652 --> 08:06.776
Why "ha"?

08:06.862 --> 08:07.903
Ah-ha-ha.

08:08.071 --> 08:10.322
-Why two ha's?
-I wouldn't say they love it.

08:10.449 --> 08:12.449
-You wouldn't? Why?
-Because they're miserable.

08:12.534 --> 08:13.617
-Oh.
-And broke.

08:13.702 --> 08:14.784
-As am I.
-Oh.

08:14.953 --> 08:16.203
I wrote all about it
in my memoir

08:16.330 --> 08:18.246
<i> Soul tales</i>
<i> from beyond the breeze.</i>

08:18.332 --> 08:19.581
Still looking for a publisher

08:19.666 --> 08:21.374
And maybe a computer
so I can actually write it.

08:21.502 --> 08:23.293
If you have a spare computer,
let me know.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.795
-I-I don't think I do.
-Huh, pity.

08:25.881 --> 08:27.047
Are these napkins free to take?

08:27.132 --> 08:28.965
-Lot of spills on the bus.
-Uh... Sure.

08:29.051 --> 08:30.884
And of course toilet paper
isn't cheap.

08:30.928 --> 08:32.052
Ooh, this is good stuff.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.304
[quietly] okay, tina,
you stand on that side,

08:34.473 --> 08:35.680
And I'll stand on this side.

08:35.766 --> 08:36.806
If he tries to go that way,

08:36.892 --> 08:38.433
Make noise
and send him back to me.

08:38.519 --> 08:39.976
-Okay.
-Then I'll get him
with the blanket.

08:40.062 --> 08:42.062
I couldn't find a box,
but a blanket's fine, right?

08:42.231 --> 08:43.730
Um, I'm a little concerned?

08:43.815 --> 08:45.148
And, teddy,
on the count of three,

08:45.234 --> 08:46.483
You pull back the dumpster.

08:46.568 --> 08:48.235
Yup, yup. I'm not totally sure
I can move

08:48.320 --> 08:49.903
A heavy steel dumpster
with just my hands,

08:49.988 --> 08:52.322
-But maybe I'll get super
strength, right?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.324
You just need to get it out
like ten inches.

08:54.451 --> 08:55.909
You're doing
the lord's work there.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.536
-Thanks, mr. Huggins.
-But just to say it,

08:57.663 --> 08:58.745
He's gonna bite you.

08:58.914 --> 08:59.913
Is that what you're going for?

08:59.998 --> 09:01.122
-Uh...
-It's gonna be fine.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.123
It's gonna be fine.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.708
Ooh, I can see his foot better.

09:03.835 --> 09:06.169
It has a splinter in it.
He's almost got it out.

09:06.255 --> 09:07.963
I guess that licking was smart.

09:08.006 --> 09:09.756
Sorry, king.
Ooh, he got it out.

09:09.841 --> 09:11.916
All right, here we go.
One...

09:11.927 --> 09:13.593
-Uh...
-Two... Tina, no. Nuh-uh.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.053
-Sorry.
-Three.
-[grunts] oh.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.888
It's not that hard.
Good wheels on this thing.

09:16.974 --> 09:19.048
Here, king.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

09:19.101 --> 09:21.476
I mean, you're already hurt.
You know what I mean.

09:21.562 --> 09:22.686
-Yah.
-[growls softly]

09:22.771 --> 09:23.937
-He's getting away.
-[tina] uh-oh.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.480
No! I missed him. Ah.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.607
Animal control will be here
any minute.

09:27.693 --> 09:28.817
But the splinter.

09:28.944 --> 09:30.193
We-we can tell them
it was just a splinter.

09:30.279 --> 09:32.320
But he got it out.
So, no evidence.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.155
Now he's just a limpy,
cranky raccoon.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.658
-Oh, no.
-But he's running away,

09:36.785 --> 09:39.119
So animal control still probably
won't be able to find him.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.912
-She's right.
-They won't know where he went.

09:40.998 --> 09:42.330
They can torture us
all they want.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.291
-We're not gonna talk.
-I guess.

09:44.376 --> 09:45.834
Unless they do fingernails
or eyes.

09:45.961 --> 09:47.460
I-I can't handle
anything in my eyes.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.296
Or sleep deprivation.
I need my eight.

09:49.381 --> 09:50.630
I won't talk.

09:50.716 --> 09:52.674
Unless they try to bribe me
with some macaroons.

09:52.801 --> 09:54.843
[gasps]
oh, I love macaroons.

09:54.886 --> 09:56.261
If they have macaroons...
[chuckles]

09:56.388 --> 09:57.762
Y'all gonna have to forgive me.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.307
[whispering]
I feel like we should get
our candy back...

10:00.434 --> 10:01.433
Not sure
what's going on in there.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.101
They're not doing
any face-smushing.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.519
Yeah, what's wrong with them?

10:04.605 --> 10:06.354
Uh, what's happening?
Where are you going?

10:06.398 --> 10:07.939
The show's just getting started.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.774
Sorry, louise.
We were talking, and...

10:09.901 --> 10:12.152
Maybe it'd be easier to watch
the concert from the street?

10:12.270 --> 10:14.362
Where we could have
a clear view of the stage?

10:14.489 --> 10:16.489
From the street?
Yeah, I've got news.

10:16.617 --> 10:18.575
When you're our size
there's no such thing

10:18.660 --> 10:20.493
As a "clear view of the stage."

10:20.662 --> 10:23.204
You'll be out there watching
the tall person butt show.

10:23.332 --> 10:25.290
And, my friends,
you won't want an encore.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.958
I can get on ollie's shoulders.

10:27.044 --> 10:28.793
And I can get
on andy's shoulders.

10:28.879 --> 10:30.962
Maybe I'll hop
on their shoulders?

10:31.089 --> 10:32.422
So, this is awkward.

10:32.507 --> 10:34.883
-Can we have our candy back?
-You cannot have it back.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.469
I mean, yes, you can,
if that's what you want,

10:37.554 --> 10:40.180
But instead
how about an upgrade?

10:40.265 --> 10:42.515
-[gene] huh?
-An upgrade?
-What kind of upgrade?

10:42.601 --> 10:46.895
Uh, how do you like the sound
of an all-access backstage pass?

10:47.064 --> 10:48.772
[coughs] sort of. Look.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.315
The real show's happening
back there.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.817
We're talking human drama.
Crazy stuff.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.361
-Drugs, maybe.
-[arnold] wow.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.237
That guy at the snack table
sure seems to like

10:56.365 --> 10:58.239
What I think is black licorice?

10:58.367 --> 10:59.949
As addictive as any narcotic.

11:00.077 --> 11:01.951
Huh, that lady's
blowing her nose really hard.

11:02.079 --> 11:03.119
Let me see.

11:03.205 --> 11:05.121
She really knows her way
around a tissue.

11:05.207 --> 11:07.499
Yup, insiders-only stuff
right there.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.584
So, what do you say
we bring over the seats

11:09.670 --> 11:12.170
-And, uh, keep the show rolling?
-I don't know.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.713
-We'll throw in snacks.
-Eh...

11:13.840 --> 11:15.882
And other perks
to be named later.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.592
-Free pelotons.
-Not free pelotons.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.844
How about we get to sleep
in your bathtub?

11:19.930 --> 11:21.012
Oh, my god. Yes.

11:21.098 --> 11:22.347
Uh... Okay?

11:22.474 --> 11:24.349
-[both] yay!
-As a guy with allergies,

11:24.434 --> 11:26.559
I'm invested
in this nose-blowing lady.

11:26.603 --> 11:27.769
Ha. Very good.

11:27.896 --> 11:29.354
Gene, get the chairs.
And you know what?

11:29.398 --> 11:30.980
Throw in a few of our cushiest
seat cushions.

11:31.108 --> 11:33.441
-You mean mom and dad's pillows?
-Exactly.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.653
Uh, linda,
are-are you coming out here?

11:36.822 --> 11:38.154
Do you want me
to go in there and cook?

11:38.198 --> 11:39.906
-No, no, I'm cooking.
-I mean, I think you're just

11:39.991 --> 11:41.866
Pushing onions around
on the cutting board?

11:41.993 --> 11:43.493
Yeah, yeah,
that's part of the process.

11:43.578 --> 11:44.703
Oh, god, they're here.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.037
-Oh, no.
-I'll go talk to them.

11:46.123 --> 11:47.789
Okay. Thanks for doing that
to the onion.

11:47.833 --> 11:50.625
Afternoon. Are you the one
who called about a raccoon?

11:50.752 --> 11:51.835
No. Goodbye.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.169
Good luck with
the controlling animals.

11:53.255 --> 11:55.088
-Uh...
-Mom?
-Linda. Calm.

11:55.173 --> 11:56.881
Sorry, I mean, that was us.

11:56.967 --> 11:59.718
Yeah. But it was, uh...
Ha. It's a funny story.

11:59.803 --> 12:02.011
-How so?
-I saw a dog.

12:02.139 --> 12:04.222
And I thought it was a raccoon.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.224
-Ha! Silly linda.
-A dog?

12:06.309 --> 12:08.017
Yup, just a dog.
Total dog.

12:08.103 --> 12:11.062
He had a bone and a collar.
A waggly tail.

12:11.148 --> 12:12.439
-He was barking.
-He was.

12:12.524 --> 12:14.065
-And licking himself.
-Very true.

12:14.151 --> 12:16.568
So there is no raccoon
out in the daytime

12:16.695 --> 12:17.694
-Appearing injured?
-Nope.

12:17.863 --> 12:19.070
-Uh-uh.
-No, officer.

12:19.156 --> 12:20.655
Okay, then what is that?

12:20.782 --> 12:22.115
-[linda] oh, no.
-[teddy] ah!

12:22.159 --> 12:23.408
[officer]
hmm. He's limping.

12:23.577 --> 12:26.035
-Could be distemper.
-No. He has great temper.

12:26.163 --> 12:27.620
It was a splinter in his foot.

12:27.789 --> 12:28.830
But it fell out.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.290
I'm not just saying that
to protect him.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.532
You got to believe me.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.042
I'm a normal,
believable person, right?

12:33.170 --> 12:34.169
I need to check it out.

12:34.296 --> 12:35.879
No, no, no.
No pole. No pole.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.881
Uh... It keeps me safe
from the animal?

12:37.966 --> 12:39.382
Also, it's my lucky pole.

12:39.468 --> 12:40.967
I get 'em every time
with this thing.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.260
No, no, no, no, no, no.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.344
Oh. He's gone.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.846
Oh, well.
Thanks for coming by.

12:44.973 --> 12:46.389
-Can't catch 'em all.
-Oh, no. I catch 'em all.

12:46.475 --> 12:47.974
Everyone at work hates me
'cause of it.

12:48.143 --> 12:49.559
That, and I correct
everyone's grammar.

12:49.644 --> 12:52.020
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Don't go, don't go.

12:55.859 --> 12:57.859
Oh, my god. We can't let her
find little king trashmouth.

12:57.986 --> 12:58.818
Did anyone see where he went?

12:58.945 --> 13:00.445
-No. Sorry.
-Me neither.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.781
I was distracted by
how that pole looks like...

13:02.866 --> 13:04.532
Not a noose, but a little bit?

13:04.659 --> 13:06.242
Oh...
What do we do now?

13:06.369 --> 13:07.994
Maybe mr. Huggins saw
where he went.

13:08.079 --> 13:09.078
Shoot. He's gone.

13:09.164 --> 13:10.371
Probably went to that concert.

13:10.499 --> 13:11.790
I hope he's dancing
for all of us.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.208
But also he's got that bad hip.

13:13.376 --> 13:14.709
Maybe he's dancing
on his left leg.

13:14.753 --> 13:16.795
Maybe we could find
little king trashmouth

13:16.922 --> 13:18.546
-Before she does?
-I don't know.

13:18.673 --> 13:20.048
-Lot of alleys.
-We could split up.

13:20.175 --> 13:21.049
I could follow her

13:21.218 --> 13:22.509
And I'll shout if she finds him?

13:22.594 --> 13:23.718
Right. Uh, good.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.720
Uh, d-d-don't let her catch him.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.222
But if she does, uh, just shout.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.389
Okay, what do I shout,
what do I shout?

13:28.475 --> 13:30.767
Uh, just say, uh,
you won the lottery.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.310
-And you're excited.
-Okay.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.395
All right,
I could take that alley,

13:34.481 --> 13:36.481
-And you take the other one?
-Yeah. Yeah, okay.

13:36.650 --> 13:39.108
Actually, can we switch alleys?
I just like this one better.

13:39.194 --> 13:40.568
Yeah, sure, yeah.

13:40.654 --> 13:43.780
And there's the endless travel
to shabby little towns.

13:43.865 --> 13:45.698
-No offense.
-None taken.

13:45.784 --> 13:46.991
I mean, some taken.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.493
And we sleep
in tiny coffin-like beds

13:48.578 --> 13:51.496
On a bus that seems to somehow
store farts forever.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.915
But there must be some reason
they keep going.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.250
Sure. The fact
that there's nothing else

13:55.377 --> 13:56.626
That they could do for money.

13:56.711 --> 13:59.712
Right. But, you know,
people enjoy their music?

13:59.798 --> 14:02.048
That must make it all
feel worth it.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.466
Oh, you mean the one song

14:03.552 --> 14:04.801
That they wrote
a million years ago?

14:04.886 --> 14:06.553
Yeah, imagine
if you did one thing,

14:06.596 --> 14:08.388
One good thing, sure,

14:08.431 --> 14:11.933
But one thing over and over
and over and over

14:12.060 --> 14:13.518
For the rest of your life.

14:13.603 --> 14:16.187
-Can you picture what
a nightmare that would be?
-Um...

14:16.314 --> 14:18.106
That's what happens to a dream
when you cling to it.

14:18.191 --> 14:21.109
You can end up hating it
but doing it anyway because

14:21.194 --> 14:22.652
What the hell else
are you gonna do?

14:22.779 --> 14:25.446
-Right.
-Anyhoo, I wasn't gonna
order soft serve,

14:25.532 --> 14:27.398
But now I kind of want
soft serve.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.868
Do you give out free samples?
I would need 12.

14:29.953 --> 14:32.120
-I'll just give you a cup.
-Thank you.

14:32.247 --> 14:33.913
Best thing that's happened
to me all tour, huh?

14:33.999 --> 14:35.540
It's going in my book.

14:35.584 --> 14:37.584
Ah, the breezers
are starting their set.

14:37.627 --> 14:40.086
-Do you need to go back outside?
-Not really.

14:40.171 --> 14:41.921
It's a well-oiled machine
at this point.

14:42.007 --> 14:45.049
A well-oiled, sad,
soul-crushing machine.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.134
[sighs]

14:46.261 --> 14:47.343
[louise]
enjoying the show, folks?

14:47.429 --> 14:48.803
[rudy] that guy
down there has been

14:48.930 --> 14:50.805
Coiling a cable
for like half an hour.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.640
I know, right?
It's mesmerizing.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.934
How long is that cable?
When will it end?

14:55.061 --> 14:56.811
-It ended.
-Aw.
-I miss it.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.438
And how about that music, huh?

14:58.523 --> 15:00.481
Isn't it more fun to imagine
what the band is doing?

15:00.567 --> 15:01.524
T-shirts.

15:01.651 --> 15:02.817
Get your t-shirts.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.945
This one's 30% cotton,
but 100% rocking.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.113
Is that magic marker?

15:07.198 --> 15:08.698
-What makes you say that?
-My eyes.

15:08.783 --> 15:11.910
Look, you could pay 25 bucks
for a shirt down there

15:11.953 --> 15:13.369
Or three bucks' worth of candy
up here.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.330
Also, good luck finding
youth sizes.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.498
Or fun magic marker fragrances.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.917
I guess I'll take a shirt.
Youth medium.

15:19.044 --> 15:20.209
All right.

15:20.295 --> 15:21.961
Wear it proudly,
my medium-sized friend.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.797
Anybody else?
Ooh, this one comes with free...

15:24.883 --> 15:26.883
What I think might be
cheese crumbs.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.259
Fancy.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.053
Where is he?
Where is he?

15:30.138 --> 15:31.721
King, it's linda.

15:31.806 --> 15:33.806
Your friend,
your best human friend.

15:33.934 --> 15:36.476
Mr. Mouth.
Mr. Trashmouth. Or king.

15:36.645 --> 15:38.061
I don't know what you like
to be called.

15:38.146 --> 15:40.480
Please don't be in this alley,
mr. Little king.

15:40.649 --> 15:43.066
I hope you went to the beach,
or you hopped on a freight train

15:43.193 --> 15:45.360
And you're learning to play
the harmonica right now.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.779
-[raccoon chitters]
-aha.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.822
Okay.
I'm coming towards you.

15:49.950 --> 15:50.990
I'm just walking over there

15:51.117 --> 15:53.743
To show you this funny video
on my phone.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.036
Oh, no. I won the lottery.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.621
I won the lottery.
I can't believe it.

15:56.748 --> 15:59.540
Does anyone want to share it?
Uh, come on over here.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.667
-To me.
-Oh, boy.

16:00.752 --> 16:01.834
Oh, my god, good for tina.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.336
No, wait.
That's the distraction.

16:03.421 --> 16:04.587
Right, right, right,
right, right. That's bad.

16:04.714 --> 16:07.548
[panting] whoops. Sorry.
Oh, god. Sorry. Sorry.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.801
[panting]

16:10.512 --> 16:12.303
-[chittering]
-[linda] oh, no. King.

16:12.430 --> 16:13.972
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

16:14.057 --> 16:17.183
Ooh, on the good leg.
On the good leg.

16:21.564 --> 16:22.855
[chittering]

16:22.983 --> 16:25.066
I'm sorry, king.
I did this.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.694
I'm the reason you're gonna die.
I'm the worst.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.822
I wish it was me and not you.
Okay, not that far, but...

16:30.907 --> 16:33.324
I don't know how I'm gonna
live with myself after this.

16:33.410 --> 16:36.035
Maybe we use
some of my lottery money

16:36.162 --> 16:37.578
To buy a helicopter and fly in?

16:37.664 --> 16:40.456
I'm so confused right now.
Is that lottery stuff real?

16:40.583 --> 16:41.582
I don't know!

16:41.710 --> 16:43.001
Maybe just let me do my job,

16:43.128 --> 16:44.836
Protecting the public
from diseased wildlife?

16:44.921 --> 16:46.170
I failed you.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.464
And I'm never gonna
forgive myself, never, ever.

16:48.550 --> 16:51.175
[sighs]
got to get my head in the game.

16:51.302 --> 16:53.594
Think, linda, think.

16:55.306 --> 16:56.514
Hi, barry, just passing through.

16:56.599 --> 16:57.974
Oh... Wine lady?

16:58.101 --> 17:00.184
Uh, yeah, it's linda.
You can call me that, though.

17:00.311 --> 17:01.352
You want anything? Merlot?

17:01.479 --> 17:03.021
Ooh, merlot.
Uh, later, later.

17:03.148 --> 17:05.314
Can I borrow one of these?
Can I open this door real quick?

17:05.400 --> 17:08.526
-[chitters]
-I'm not gonna hurt you.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.028
As far as you know.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.280
-What the...?
-[both gasp]

17:12.407 --> 17:13.823
Thanks, barry.
Just got to take this box home.

17:13.908 --> 17:15.700
There's no wine in it,
just a raccoon.

17:15.827 --> 17:16.659
Okay?

17:16.745 --> 17:17.785
Raccoon box coming through.

17:17.912 --> 17:20.079
Ooh, good song.
I like it. Funky.

17:20.206 --> 17:23.791
[ian]<i> imagine if you did</i>
<i> one thing over and over</i>

17:23.877 --> 17:25.710

-Bob.
-Yeah?

17:33.470 --> 17:34.969
-They're playing
"gas in my car."
-oh.

17:35.096 --> 17:36.596
Thought you might want
to watch this one.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.347
From where I'm sitting
you can see the band.

17:38.475 --> 17:40.600
-Sort of. Sometimes.
-Oh, yeah.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.478
I can kind of make out
one of their arms.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.979
Wrinkly biceps.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.064
Hey, I know this one.

17:46.149 --> 17:47.106
My dad has it on his playlist

17:47.233 --> 17:48.224
Of songs he wants me to like.

17:48.276 --> 17:49.609
-Do you like it?
-Oh, sure.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.611
My dad has great taste.
He told me so, himself.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.988
Maybe it's just the magic marker
smell making me dizzy,

17:54.074 --> 17:55.364
But I'm into this.

17:55.492 --> 17:57.700
This song makes me want to shake
my potty parts.

17:57.786 --> 17:58.910
They're all potty parts, honey.

17:58.995 --> 18:02.121
-Yeah.
-Hey, dancing's extra.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.539
Just kidding, go nuts.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.875
[grunting]

18:05.960 --> 18:08.836
-What a day, huh, officer?
-Darn raccoons, am I right?

18:08.963 --> 18:11.130
Or dogs. Who even knows
which is which?

18:11.216 --> 18:12.340
Mm-hmm.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.424
Yeah, well.
I'm moving on to another call.

18:13.510 --> 18:14.467
See you later.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.219
I mean, we won't
see you later probably,

18:16.304 --> 18:18.513
But it's a thing that people
say to each other, I think.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.181
Yup. Goodbye.

18:21.518 --> 18:22.892
She's gone.
She's gone, right?

18:22.977 --> 18:24.477
-Is she gone?
-Mom. Oh, my god, you did it.

18:24.562 --> 18:25.645
Whoa.

18:25.730 --> 18:26.979
Linda, you saved the king.

18:27.065 --> 18:28.189
You're gonna get knighted.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.024
I mean, you almost
got him killed.

18:30.151 --> 18:31.567
But then you redeemed yourself.
How's he doing?

18:31.694 --> 18:33.653
Okay, I think.
Want to say hi?

18:33.780 --> 18:34.862
-Hi.
-[chittering]

18:34.948 --> 18:36.906
Stepping away from you.
Nothing personal.

18:36.991 --> 18:39.534
[chuckles] he's just
a little rambunctious.

18:39.619 --> 18:40.952
Wait, is that...?

18:41.079 --> 18:42.120
[all] gary.
