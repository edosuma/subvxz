02:44.702 --> 02:46.285
We will feed her.

03:34.510 --> 03:35.927
Oh, no.

03:58.701 --> 03:59.980
Molly.

03:59.982 --> 04:00.813
Molly, get up.

04:00.815 --> 04:01.648
Let me in.

04:03.319 --> 04:04.152
Bobbi.

04:05.252 --> 04:08.853
Jesus, Alvin, do you
know what time it is?

04:08.855 --> 04:12.145
Can I please just use your bathroom?

04:12.147 --> 04:13.813
Are you okay?

04:13.815 --> 04:15.742
- You look sick.
- Look, I need

04:15.744 --> 04:17.548
to use the bathroom,
can I use the bathroom?

04:17.550 --> 04:18.716
- No!
- Please.

04:55.835 --> 04:57.052
Did you hear that?

04:57.054 --> 04:58.506
What are you talking about?

04:58.508 --> 04:59.833
She's following me.

04:59.835 --> 05:01.085
Are you okay?

05:06.256 --> 05:07.920
Well, if you're not gonna talk to me,

05:07.922 --> 05:09.672
just don't come back.

05:10.980 --> 05:13.980
I don't wanna see you again, I just.

05:22.329 --> 05:24.162
Oh come on, come on.

05:36.346 --> 05:41.346
Molly, Bobbi, Molly.

05:41.447 --> 05:42.278
No.

05:46.222 --> 05:47.472
No, no, no, no.

05:58.241 --> 05:59.072
Why?

05:59.074 --> 06:01.214
Dammit, Alvin, I'll call the police.

06:25.068 --> 06:26.342
Sarah.

06:26.344 --> 06:27.177
Oh, hey.

06:28.083 --> 06:28.914
How'd you do?

06:28.916 --> 06:30.102
How do you mean?

06:30.104 --> 06:31.271
On the test.

06:32.723 --> 06:35.725
I did pretty all right, how about you?

06:35.727 --> 06:36.560
Less than.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.921
History just doesn't click with me.

06:38.923 --> 06:42.495
I could seriously use a study
buddy if you're interested.

06:42.497 --> 06:43.809
I don't know...

06:43.811 --> 06:45.438
Oh, come on, it'll be fun.

06:45.440 --> 06:46.696
You can come over to my new place,

06:46.698 --> 06:48.059
which I know you haven't been to yet,

06:48.061 --> 06:49.684
and I could make you a smoothie

06:49.686 --> 06:52.936
and you could help me get my grades up.

06:54.046 --> 06:56.121
Yeah, yeah, sure.

06:56.123 --> 06:57.053
Oh, perfect, thank you.

06:57.055 --> 06:58.405
I'll text you with the address later.

06:58.407 --> 07:00.574
- Okay, see ya then.
- Bye.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.281
Surprisingly edible.

07:31.283 --> 07:32.116
Right?

07:33.819 --> 07:36.098
Oh hey, how's that, are
you writing that one thing?

07:36.100 --> 07:36.931
What was it?

07:36.933 --> 07:38.434
I don't know.

07:38.436 --> 07:42.346
You know, sometimes I just
hate how much I love to write.

07:42.348 --> 07:45.063
Like, I've been trying to write
this book for two years now,

07:45.065 --> 07:47.005
but I just keep getting distracted

07:47.007 --> 07:51.648
and writing stupid things
that don't even matter.

07:51.650 --> 07:53.754
Like what?

07:53.756 --> 07:54.855
I don't know.

07:54.857 --> 07:57.936
I guess I'm just looking
for the right inspiration.

07:57.938 --> 07:59.355
Whatever that is.

08:02.271 --> 08:04.495
Look, all you need to know
is that the transcontinental

08:04.497 --> 08:07.914
railroad was build between 1863 and 1869,

08:09.471 --> 08:12.202
and that connected the San
Francisco Bay Area with...

08:12.204 --> 08:13.164
See that's the problem right there,

08:13.166 --> 08:16.654
I don't remember dates
and names very well, so.

08:16.656 --> 08:17.825
Okay, well, should we come up

08:17.827 --> 08:20.478
with a pneumonic device to help you out?

08:20.480 --> 08:21.897
Probably, yeah.

08:23.187 --> 08:26.714
Okay.

08:26.716 --> 08:28.891
It's my roommate.

08:28.893 --> 08:29.810
Oh, my God.

08:33.767 --> 08:35.953
Jesus, it is about frickin' time.

08:35.956 --> 08:38.448
The door was unlocked, dumb ass.

08:38.450 --> 08:40.702
- Oh, I resent that, okay?
- Great.

08:40.703 --> 08:42.409
Oh, hey you.

08:42.412 --> 08:43.768
It's Sarah.

08:43.770 --> 08:46.644
Yeah, from biology
class, what's goin' on?

08:46.646 --> 08:48.235
Okay, go away, we're studying.

08:48.237 --> 08:49.068
Oh yeah, excuse the hell

08:49.070 --> 08:49.901
out of me for trying to assault her...

08:49.903 --> 08:51.381
Also, can you pick up your shit?

08:51.383 --> 08:53.000
- Yeah, Mom.
- Great.

08:53.002 --> 08:56.274
Okay, transsexual railroad 1869.

08:56.276 --> 08:59.226
I didn't know that you
and Josh were roommates.

08:59.228 --> 09:01.348
Oh yeah, I try to forget about it.

09:01.350 --> 09:04.013
Oh, how long have you known each other?

09:04.015 --> 09:06.848
Uh, since middle school I think.

09:07.921 --> 09:11.594
We kinda grew up together,
our parents are neighbors.

09:11.596 --> 09:14.101
- Didn't know that.
- Yeah.

09:14.103 --> 09:17.020
How long have you lived together?

09:18.108 --> 09:19.843
Wait a minute.

09:19.845 --> 09:21.412
Wait, seriously?

09:21.414 --> 09:22.818
I didn't say anything.

09:22.820 --> 09:24.215
No, this would be perfect.

09:24.217 --> 09:26.109
He would totally go for your type.

09:26.111 --> 09:30.228
Forget it, it's, what
do you mean your type?

09:30.230 --> 09:32.773
Um, you know like, cute nerdy girl

09:32.775 --> 09:36.069
that likes to write and wears glasses.

09:36.071 --> 09:37.648
But honestly though,
he's a really good guy

09:37.650 --> 09:40.638
and once you get to know
him, he's pretty great.

09:40.640 --> 09:44.871
Once you get past his rock and roll shit,

09:44.873 --> 09:46.570
stick thing he's doing.

09:46.572 --> 09:48.464
So, he's single?

09:48.466 --> 09:49.963
No he's not.

09:49.965 --> 09:52.034
He has a girlfriend, but she's a bitch.

09:52.036 --> 09:53.676
So, I think that you'd
be a lot better for him.

09:53.678 --> 09:56.242
No, no, I'm not the kinda
girl to swoop in like some

09:56.244 --> 09:58.931
vulture and snatch up boys
from their girlfriends.

09:58.933 --> 10:02.716
So, Walter is having
a little shindig over

10:02.718 --> 10:05.667
at this creepy ass old
house that his uncle bought.

10:05.669 --> 10:08.559
The bud will be blowin' and
the drink will be flowin'.

10:08.561 --> 10:09.564
Did you make that up yourself?

10:09.566 --> 10:10.595
- Yeah, I did.
- You should get more.

10:10.597 --> 10:11.627
- Thank you for that.
- It's good.

10:11.629 --> 10:14.879
Yeah, so are we gonna do this or not?

10:16.050 --> 10:17.113
Hell yeah.

10:17.115 --> 10:18.143
Sweet.

10:18.145 --> 10:21.106
Oh, I think I'm just
gonna stay in tonight.

10:21.108 --> 10:25.700
Oh, well I'm gonna go
and take a shower, so.

10:25.702 --> 10:26.800
You're just gonna stay in?

10:26.802 --> 10:27.958
It's last minute.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.821
Come on, Sarah.

10:29.823 --> 10:31.278
How do you expect to be a writer

10:31.280 --> 10:33.270
if you don't have any personal experience?

10:33.272 --> 10:35.735
No, I'm serious, like two minutes
ago you were talking about

10:35.737 --> 10:37.902
how you need some inspiration.

10:37.904 --> 10:40.107
This could be it, you never know.

10:40.109 --> 10:42.404
You might make some new friends,

10:42.406 --> 10:43.677
and if you don't have any fun,

10:43.679 --> 10:46.447
I will personally escort you home.

11:01.508 --> 11:02.591
She's here.

11:09.343 --> 11:11.911
Nice of you to show up.

11:11.913 --> 11:13.867
- What did I do this time?
- What did you do?

11:13.869 --> 11:16.865
Do you see how your daughter talks to me?

11:16.867 --> 11:18.586
Where do you think you're going?

11:18.588 --> 11:20.368
To my room.

11:20.370 --> 11:25.287
We're your parents, we deserve
to know where you've been.

11:34.931 --> 11:36.320
You know, we put food on your table

11:36.322 --> 11:38.007
and a roof over your head.

11:38.009 --> 11:41.259
You live here, you live under our rule.

11:42.664 --> 11:43.942
Are you even listening to me?

11:43.944 --> 11:46.111
Get your hand off of me.

11:47.112 --> 11:47.945
God.

11:50.083 --> 11:51.000
God dammit.

11:55.347 --> 11:56.821
Okay, you know what?

11:56.823 --> 11:58.308
I thought that once I went to college,

11:58.310 --> 12:00.551
maybe things would change around here.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.442
But you just sit there and you let her go

12:02.444 --> 12:04.527
at me every god damn day.

12:07.312 --> 12:08.928
So you wanna know something, mom?

12:08.930 --> 12:11.464
I'm gonna go hang out with
my fucking friends, okay?

12:11.466 --> 12:15.049
Something you wouldn't
know anything about.

12:45.276 --> 12:46.109
Ouch.

12:47.596 --> 12:48.840
God, is this necessary?

12:48.842 --> 12:50.138
No.

12:50.140 --> 12:51.655
Then why are we doing it?

12:51.657 --> 12:52.488
Because this is what girls

12:52.490 --> 12:53.892
do to get ready for parties.

12:56.004 --> 12:59.356
See, that wasn't so bad.

12:59.358 --> 13:03.865
I am really not the type
for this sort of thing.

13:03.867 --> 13:06.913
Everybody's the type
for this sort of thing.

13:06.915 --> 13:09.889
Even guys need a little
makeover every once in a while.

13:09.891 --> 13:11.184
Their skin's always so dry.

13:12.883 --> 13:17.883
I don't know, makeovers and
makeup's just not my thing.

13:18.312 --> 13:19.895
Think I look fine without it.

13:19.897 --> 13:21.365
Oh, definitely.

13:21.367 --> 13:22.734
You're beautiful, but
this is just gonna make

13:22.736 --> 13:25.004
some of your best features pop.

13:35.112 --> 13:37.529
I'm glad you could make it.

13:41.312 --> 13:42.312
Sarah, yeah.

13:43.631 --> 13:45.005
It should be interesting.

13:45.007 --> 13:46.988
Yeah, well, at least you two look nice.

13:46.990 --> 13:49.600
Thanks.

13:49.602 --> 13:50.692
So how's the band going?

13:50.694 --> 13:52.825
Ah, it's okay, I guess.

13:52.827 --> 13:55.583
Our drummer keeps
flaking out on rehearsal.

13:55.585 --> 13:58.069
It's a little shaky right
now, but you know how it is.

13:59.733 --> 14:01.917
But, I did bring my acoustic
so I can play us some tunes.

14:01.919 --> 14:06.096
Sounds good.

14:06.098 --> 14:08.246
Sarah, what do you do?

14:08.248 --> 14:10.988
I work a bookstore on campus.

14:10.990 --> 14:13.102
Not your job, I mean,
what do you really do?

14:13.104 --> 14:15.896
Uh, I'm a writer, I guess.

14:18.257 --> 14:19.280
What, like stories?

14:19.282 --> 14:21.915
Yeah, stories mostly.

14:21.917 --> 14:23.170
That's cool.

14:23.172 --> 14:25.758
I like to think I write stories
myself through my music.

14:28.542 --> 14:29.754
So how far are we?

14:29.756 --> 14:30.974
We're not too far.

14:35.512 --> 14:37.018
What exactly is this place?

14:38.489 --> 14:39.700
I'm not really 100% sure.

14:39.702 --> 14:42.301
I guess Walter's uncle
bought this abandoned house

14:42.303 --> 14:43.429
and he's tryin' to have a party there

14:43.431 --> 14:45.009
before they tear it down or something.

14:45.011 --> 14:47.116
Makes sense to me.

14:47.118 --> 14:49.016
Wait, who's this Walter guy?

14:49.018 --> 14:50.131
He's a friend of ours.

14:50.133 --> 14:51.616
Oh you know him, he's the ginger guy

14:51.618 --> 14:54.040
with the skinny little ass.

14:54.042 --> 14:55.792
In love with his car.

14:56.897 --> 15:01.897
Yeah, I'll definitely
recognize him now, thanks Kelsey.

15:07.004 --> 15:08.754
So, what part of town are we win?

15:10.046 --> 15:13.133
Somewhere on south side,
it's a dinky little place.

15:13.135 --> 15:14.986
Barely even part of town at all.

15:14.988 --> 15:17.531
Yeah, it's kinda shitty.

15:17.533 --> 15:20.203
I don't know, I kinda like it.

15:20.205 --> 15:22.957
It's got like this small town vibe to it.

15:22.959 --> 15:24.529
I have to agree.

15:39.538 --> 15:40.791
Oh, God.

15:40.793 --> 15:42.936
I hate sitting down for
long periods of time.

15:42.938 --> 15:45.311
I get motion sickness really bad.

15:45.313 --> 15:46.309
I'm gonna...

15:46.311 --> 15:48.319
Yeah.

15:54.752 --> 15:56.419
Sup guys?

15:58.142 --> 15:59.798
Find the place all right?

15:59.800 --> 16:01.883
Ah, not too bad.

16:09.101 --> 16:09.970
Here, big guy.

16:09.972 --> 16:12.055
Hey, always a pleasure.

16:13.508 --> 16:15.271
You cut off all your hair, man.

16:15.273 --> 16:18.023
Yeah, it was time for a change.

16:19.008 --> 16:19.996
Real smart, man.

16:19.998 --> 16:22.089
I mean, I know you're
not, but you look like it.

16:22.091 --> 16:23.132
Who's this?

16:23.134 --> 16:24.247
This is Sarah.

16:24.249 --> 16:25.407
She is one of Kelsey's friends.

16:25.409 --> 16:26.672
Ah, and
where's that troublemaker?

16:26.674 --> 16:27.522
Walter!

16:27.524 --> 16:29.777
Whoa, holy shit.

16:29.779 --> 16:30.989
How are you doin' sweetheart?

16:30.991 --> 16:32.382
- I'm good.
- Good, good.

16:32.384 --> 16:33.557
Have you met my friend, Sarah?

16:33.559 --> 16:36.006
I have, Josh was just introducing us

16:36.008 --> 16:38.189
and doing a terrible job as usual.

16:38.191 --> 16:39.935
Hey.

16:41.077 --> 16:42.578
So you guys ready to check it out?

16:42.580 --> 16:43.411
Let's do it.

16:57.195 --> 17:01.278
I love this one.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.519
Are you guys ready to
get this party started?

17:03.521 --> 17:05.104
- Hell yeah.
- Yeah.

17:16.715 --> 17:20.352
So how many people are coming tonight?

17:20.354 --> 17:23.240
Well, only a couple of people actually

17:23.242 --> 17:25.193
got back to me, besides you guys.

17:25.194 --> 17:26.217
Didn't feel like calling it off since

17:26.219 --> 17:29.041
we weren't gonna have
the house much longer.

17:29.043 --> 17:30.384
So it's just us then?

17:30.386 --> 17:31.635
How is this a party?

17:31.637 --> 17:34.342
Well, Jodie and Paul stopped by earlier.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.975
Drank four of my beers and then went

17:35.977 --> 17:36.808
to get something to eat.

17:36.810 --> 17:38.462
And Bobby said he'd stop
by later with his crew,

17:38.464 --> 17:40.957
but you know those guys, so.

17:40.959 --> 17:43.320
So not really all that
popular this week, are we?

17:43.322 --> 17:44.806
Nobody wants to party with us.

17:44.808 --> 17:46.075
Oh, speak for yourself, man.

17:46.077 --> 17:48.446
I mean, we've got the
J and we've the tunes

17:48.448 --> 17:49.846
and we've got the brews.

17:49.848 --> 17:52.348
So, sounds like a party to me.

17:54.418 --> 17:58.589
Um, I've only actually
done this once before

17:58.591 --> 18:00.840
and it didn't really do anything.

18:00.842 --> 18:03.742
It's cool, nobody feels
anything their first time.

18:03.744 --> 18:07.582
It's easy, just relax and
take in a deep breath.

18:07.584 --> 18:08.415
Oh, okay

18:13.571 --> 18:17.641
Yeah, feelin' it this time?

18:17.643 --> 18:18.743
Yeah, I think so.

18:21.562 --> 18:23.080
I've always heard if
you're not coughin',

18:23.082 --> 18:23.913
you're not feelin' it.

18:23.915 --> 18:26.588
Wow, who knew you
were such a philosopher.

18:26.590 --> 18:28.257
Hey, I totally am.

18:35.260 --> 18:37.348
Who knows that we're here?

18:37.350 --> 18:40.170
- My uncle, he's cool with it.
- Oh.

18:40.172 --> 18:42.879
Does your uncle drive
like a beat down truck?

18:42.881 --> 18:44.479
No, he drives a Mercedes.

18:44.481 --> 18:48.148
Like a really nice S
Class, with a VNC TGPS.

18:49.511 --> 18:51.107
Forward lookin' infrared.

18:51.109 --> 18:53.026
It's fast as hell, man.

18:54.239 --> 18:56.499
It's like five and a half
liter, turbo charged V12

18:56.501 --> 18:58.699
with a six speed automatic.

18:58.701 --> 19:00.589
He's too loaded to drive a truck.

19:03.220 --> 19:06.618
I'm just tryin' to be that good nephew.

19:08.268 --> 19:10.189
There's a lot to be said
about a man with no kids

19:10.191 --> 19:13.482
and more money than he
spend before he dies.

19:13.484 --> 19:15.581
Wow, piece of shit.

19:15.583 --> 19:17.152
No, it's not like that.

19:17.154 --> 19:19.721
He's my uncle, I love him, but I mean,

19:19.723 --> 19:21.261
he's a racist and he hates women.

19:21.263 --> 19:22.699
So, I mean fuck him, right?

19:22.701 --> 19:24.472
You know what that reminds me of?

19:24.474 --> 19:25.821
We should take shots.

19:25.823 --> 19:27.149
Now that's an idea.

19:27.151 --> 19:28.234
All righty.

19:34.444 --> 19:36.769
So tell me about this truck.

19:36.771 --> 19:38.354
Oh, it's nothing.

19:39.401 --> 19:41.750
I think that the weed
is just getting to me,

19:41.752 --> 19:43.008
feeling paranoid or something.

19:43.010 --> 19:43.841
Here, take this.

19:43.843 --> 19:45.540
It'll help loosen you up.

19:45.542 --> 19:48.370
Um, not really sure I
wanna get drunk tonight.

19:48.372 --> 19:53.330
Who said anything about
getting drunk, it's one shot.

19:53.332 --> 19:54.546
What should we cheers to?

19:54.548 --> 19:56.667
This dope ass house.

19:56.669 --> 19:58.338
To the dope house.

19:58.340 --> 20:00.450
To the dope house.

20:14.690 --> 20:17.978
You know, this place really is cool.

20:17.980 --> 20:19.428
When was it built?

20:19.430 --> 20:21.900
I don't know, old.

20:21.902 --> 20:23.828
I bet you that, looking
at the stonework outside

20:23.830 --> 20:26.399
it's probably like the turn
of the century or something.

20:26.401 --> 20:28.464
Sarah, really? We are a
party and all you can talk

20:28.466 --> 20:30.815
about is the architecture of the house.

20:30.817 --> 20:32.157
Hey, leave her alone, man.

20:32.159 --> 20:34.597
This place is pretty legit.

20:34.599 --> 20:37.096
We should go check it out.

20:37.098 --> 20:38.116
May as well.

20:38.118 --> 20:39.917
I mean, nobody else is here, right?

20:39.919 --> 20:41.169
Guys, really?

20:42.140 --> 20:45.778
Hey, we might find like a
big bag of money or something.

20:45.780 --> 20:47.627
Or a bag full of pot.

20:47.629 --> 20:49.962
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

21:45.548 --> 21:46.379
Where do you think it goes?

21:46.381 --> 21:47.933
I don't know if we should open that.

21:47.935 --> 21:49.223
Yeah, no.

21:49.225 --> 21:50.433
No, no, no, no.

21:50.435 --> 21:51.705
There could be a bum down there

21:51.707 --> 21:53.963
that has been squattin'
for God knows how long,

21:53.965 --> 21:56.305
and he heard us partying
and I am not about

21:56.307 --> 21:57.593
to deal with a pissed off hobo.

21:57.595 --> 21:58.426
I'm just sayin'.

21:58.428 --> 21:59.687
- Oh, God.
- Not doin' it.

21:59.689 --> 22:01.116
Does anybody have a pocket knife?

22:01.118 --> 22:02.201
Ooh.

22:04.177 --> 22:07.106
- Yeah.
- What, I was a boy scout.

22:07.108 --> 22:08.455
Right.

22:08.457 --> 22:10.290
For like six months.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.638
Well all right then.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.302
Thank you, sir.

22:51.626 --> 22:54.543
You guys see anything down there?

22:56.068 --> 22:58.818
It's, it's not that impressive.

23:40.504 --> 23:41.587
Oh, my God.

24:29.665 --> 24:32.450
Walter!

24:32.452 --> 24:33.285
What?

24:37.504 --> 24:38.337
Really?

24:57.766 --> 25:00.099
Hey, check it out.

25:13.408 --> 25:14.491
What is it?

25:16.858 --> 25:17.775
Come see.

25:30.519 --> 25:32.798
What the fuck was that?

25:32.800 --> 25:34.255
I don't know, it sounded like it

25:34.257 --> 25:35.855
came from inside the house.

25:35.857 --> 25:38.946
I think it came from the front room.

25:38.948 --> 25:39.865
Let's go.

25:50.174 --> 25:51.007
Walter.

25:54.116 --> 25:57.283
Now, what the fuck is goin' on here?

25:59.046 --> 26:00.764
Excuse me, who are you?

26:00.766 --> 26:02.811
Yeah, I could ask the same question.

26:02.813 --> 26:04.525
You teenagers think you can
just come in here and break in

26:04.527 --> 26:06.864
private property and start stealin' shit?

26:06.866 --> 26:09.144
What do you think this
is, a third world country?

26:09.146 --> 26:12.104
It's god damn America boy,
and we got laws around here.

26:12.106 --> 26:13.144
Now you guys better leave before

26:13.146 --> 26:15.100
I get my gun and I make you.

26:15.102 --> 26:18.161
First of all, sir, we're not teenagers.

26:18.163 --> 26:20.580
And second of all, this property belongs

26:20.582 --> 26:23.612
to Jeffery Daniels,
I'm his nephew, Walter.

26:23.614 --> 26:24.729
Walter Daniels.

26:24.731 --> 26:26.830
Yeah, I don't know a Walter Daniels.

26:26.832 --> 26:28.660
Look, I don't mean to be
rude man, but at this point,

26:28.662 --> 26:29.999
you're the one that's trespassing,

26:30.001 --> 26:32.089
and I'm gonna have to ask
you to leave or I'm gonna be

26:32.091 --> 26:34.567
forced to call the police, all right?

26:34.569 --> 26:36.157
And tell 'em what?

26:36.159 --> 26:39.468
Explain to them what the hell
you guys are doin' in here?

26:39.470 --> 26:41.557
I mean, come on, give me a break.

26:41.559 --> 26:45.142
Now, listen here, I'll
cut you guys a deal.

26:46.260 --> 26:49.189
You don't call the cops, all right?

26:49.191 --> 26:52.098
I'll let you continue your little party,

26:52.100 --> 26:55.138
and you share some of
those goodies with me.

26:55.140 --> 26:56.717
Let me get this straight.

26:56.719 --> 26:59.607
You're gonna come in here
and ask to party with us

26:59.609 --> 27:02.757
after you barge in uninvited, unannounced,

27:02.759 --> 27:05.237
and then threaten to kick
us out with your gun?

27:05.239 --> 27:06.535
Is that about right?

27:06.537 --> 27:08.677
All right, some things were said.

27:08.679 --> 27:09.755
Yeah.

27:09.757 --> 27:11.538
It's cool now.

27:11.540 --> 27:14.877
Come on, guys, I'm just like you.

27:14.879 --> 27:16.674
I like the simple pleasures of life.

27:16.676 --> 27:18.877
I like a good beer.

27:18.879 --> 27:21.858
I like some good old
fashioned American reefer.

27:21.860 --> 27:25.193
Now just share it with me and it's good.

27:27.108 --> 27:28.275
Come on, guys.

27:30.060 --> 27:32.935
- Fuck this guy.
- I agree, fuck you, guy.

27:32.937 --> 27:34.775
Why don't you come say that
to my face, you little bitch.

27:34.777 --> 27:35.706
I just did.

27:35.708 --> 27:36.815
Hey, you know what?

27:36.817 --> 27:41.817
You know what, how about we
all just head out, all right?

27:42.249 --> 27:43.234
Seriously?

27:43.236 --> 27:45.914
You would rather leave
than party with Dewayne?

27:45.916 --> 27:46.763
- Yeah.
- Yes, yes.

27:46.765 --> 27:49.074
Definitely, absolutely would.

27:49.076 --> 27:51.576
Suit your fuckin' selves then.
You know what I'm gonna do,

27:51.578 --> 27:54.011
I'm gonna call the cops my damn self.

27:54.013 --> 27:55.893
You know, I'm gonna tell 'em
that you're over here sellin'

27:55.895 --> 27:58.554
dope and you're makin' porno movies.

27:58.556 --> 28:01.365
Oh, oh, that's a good one.

28:01.367 --> 28:04.700
You guys need to leave and I mean now.

28:13.647 --> 28:15.553
Thanks for the beer, asshole.

28:15.555 --> 28:17.381
Are you about to let
this guy kick us outa here?

28:17.383 --> 28:18.688
Yeah man, the party's over.

28:18.690 --> 28:20.739
Have a good night, Dewayne.

28:20.741 --> 28:22.127
Fuck you and your red shoes.

28:22.129 --> 28:22.962
Uh huh.

29:07.361 --> 29:08.611
Fuckin' kids.

30:36.899 --> 30:38.066
What the hell?

30:42.245 --> 30:43.245
Who's there?

30:49.172 --> 30:52.505
Jeeper.

31:16.981 --> 31:19.200
What are you doin'?

31:19.202 --> 31:20.369
Don't do this.

31:21.901 --> 31:22.734
Please.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.300
Don't do it.

33:20.062 --> 33:24.089
I don't see why we couldn't
just stay here to party.

33:24.091 --> 33:27.350
Why didn't we go to your house?
Your place is fuckin' huge.

33:27.352 --> 33:28.969
I just thought
it would be exciting.

33:28.971 --> 33:31.089
You can't say it wasn't interesting.

33:31.091 --> 33:33.436
Interesting is an
understatement, my friend.

33:33.438 --> 33:36.438
I wonder what was in the basement?

33:40.291 --> 33:41.291
Oh, sorry.

33:42.240 --> 33:43.649
You know, I'm actually
not feeling that good.

33:43.651 --> 33:46.401
I think I'm gonna turn in, sorry.

33:47.592 --> 33:49.069
It's all right.

33:49.071 --> 33:50.910
We'll hang out next time, right?

33:50.912 --> 33:51.745
Right.

33:52.889 --> 33:54.429
Want me to walk you out?

33:54.431 --> 33:56.357
Yeah, thanks.

33:59.561 --> 34:00.738
You okay?

34:00.740 --> 34:02.755
You wanna talk about something?

34:02.757 --> 34:04.946
I think that I saw
something in the basement.

34:04.948 --> 34:07.233
Yeah, like what?

34:07.235 --> 34:09.734
I don't know, I keep on trying
to convince myself that it

34:09.735 --> 34:13.152
was Walter's shadow, but I'm not so sure.

34:14.226 --> 34:15.984
Forget it, it's stupid.

34:15.985 --> 34:17.819
Sarah, just tell me.

34:19.277 --> 34:23.237
I thought that I saw a little
girl standing behind Walter,

34:23.239 --> 34:24.438
but then when he went to flash

34:24.440 --> 34:27.576
his light on her, she was gone.

34:27.578 --> 34:30.126
And I know what it sounds like, but...

34:30.128 --> 34:32.435
A little girl in the basement of a house

34:32.437 --> 34:35.525
that's been locked from the outside.

34:35.527 --> 34:36.574
She okay?

34:36.576 --> 34:37.407
Yeah, she'll be fine.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.801
She just got a little spooked is all.

34:39.803 --> 34:41.469
Where are you going?

34:47.103 --> 34:48.922
Hey.

34:48.925 --> 34:49.757
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:51.973 --> 34:53.389
Well, um, yeah.

34:54.704 --> 34:58.822
It's, the night's still sorta
young and it is a weekend.

34:58.824 --> 35:01.902
So, I don't know, I just, I
know this really cool place,

35:01.904 --> 35:03.803
it's just a few blocks away.

35:03.805 --> 35:05.232
I was thinkin' we could go

35:05.234 --> 35:08.622
and we could check it out if you want to.

35:08.624 --> 35:10.041
Um, okay, yeah.

35:13.824 --> 35:14.655
Why not.

35:14.657 --> 35:16.110
Cool, well, I'll drive.

35:16.112 --> 35:16.945
Okay.

35:21.744 --> 35:26.014
Well, I think it's probably
time that I head home.

35:26.016 --> 35:27.643
You good to drive, buddy?

35:27.645 --> 35:29.812
No, but I've been worse.

35:31.274 --> 35:32.511
Tuck Josh in for me, will ya?

35:32.513 --> 35:34.680
- Will do.
- Appreciate it.

37:19.729 --> 37:21.719
Sorry it's kind of a mess in here.

37:21.721 --> 37:24.050
We haven't really been in
here in a while, you know?

37:24.052 --> 37:25.468
Feels good though.

37:25.470 --> 37:28.387
Kinda makes me feel creative again.

37:29.481 --> 37:31.127
You should play me something.

37:31.129 --> 37:33.096
- Ooh.
- Oh, come on.

37:33.098 --> 37:34.486
I've never heard you play before.

37:34.488 --> 37:38.488
Uh, that's no surprise,
Kelsey hates our band.

38:22.782 --> 38:23.699
The fuck?

38:32.263 --> 38:33.096
Come on.

38:37.673 --> 38:38.840
Oh, thank God.

38:44.207 --> 38:45.794
What, oh, my God.

38:45.796 --> 38:46.713
Whoa, whoa.

40:27.153 --> 40:29.570
This is gonna scratch my car.

41:28.539 --> 41:29.372
What?

42:56.471 --> 42:57.304
Hello?

42:58.951 --> 42:59.784
Yeah.

43:03.410 --> 43:04.827
What do you mean?

43:25.469 --> 43:27.960
There wasn't anything
wrong with him, was there?

43:27.962 --> 43:29.488
Are you kidding?

43:29.490 --> 43:32.827
Walter was one of the
happiest people I've ever met.

43:32.829 --> 43:34.840
He had financial security.

43:34.842 --> 43:36.898
Got that new car.

43:36.900 --> 43:38.560
He loved that thing.

43:38.562 --> 43:39.748
You guys don't think it had anything

43:39.750 --> 43:41.279
to do with that house, do you?

43:41.281 --> 43:42.461
What are you talking about?

43:42.463 --> 43:46.469
You gotta admit, there was
something off about that place.

43:46.471 --> 43:49.149
Okay, the pentagram that
we found in the basement,

43:49.151 --> 43:52.170
and last night I had this crazy dream.

43:52.172 --> 43:53.836
Oh, my God, Sarah.

43:53.838 --> 43:56.486
This is not one of your story books, okay?

43:56.488 --> 43:57.988
This is real life.

43:58.947 --> 44:00.766
Our friend killed himself.

44:00.768 --> 44:01.655
Kelsey!

44:01.657 --> 44:05.485
You know, Kelsey, I
didn't mean to upset you.

44:05.487 --> 44:06.320
Kelsey.

44:07.390 --> 44:08.340
Great.

44:08.342 --> 44:09.759
She'll be fine.

44:11.109 --> 44:12.547
Yeah, I know.

44:12.549 --> 44:13.716
It's my fault.

44:14.779 --> 44:17.836
I probably shouldn't have
jumped to occult theory so soon.

44:17.838 --> 44:18.744
You don't really think it has anything

44:18.746 --> 44:20.605
to do with that house, do you?

44:20.607 --> 44:22.440
I don't know, maybe.

44:23.396 --> 44:26.765
It's just this feeling that I get.

44:26.767 --> 44:27.954
You know, maybe I'm crazy,

44:27.956 --> 44:30.873
but I think that we should go back.

44:33.196 --> 44:36.184
Well, I did leave my knife there,

44:36.186 --> 44:37.422
and there was half a joint in the ashtray.

44:37.424 --> 44:39.024
We probably need to go
back and clean that up

44:39.026 --> 44:41.434
before Walter's uncle gets there.

44:41.436 --> 44:44.485
Hope he doesn't blame anything
on our party last night,

44:44.487 --> 44:46.544
and that redneck Dewayne.

44:46.546 --> 44:48.885
He'll find any excuse to start shit.

44:48.887 --> 44:50.137
Yeah, let's go.

44:53.375 --> 44:54.208
Okay.

45:01.866 --> 45:03.485
What the hell is he doing here?

45:03.487 --> 45:05.864
I don't know.

45:05.866 --> 45:07.366
I say we find out.

45:15.116 --> 45:16.612
Do you smell that?

45:16.614 --> 45:19.966
It's even worse than last time.

45:19.968 --> 45:23.206
That is definitely not
the same smell as last time.

45:23.208 --> 45:25.815
Did somebody throw up in here last night?

45:25.817 --> 45:29.225
Not that I'm aware of.

45:31.035 --> 45:32.382
- Oh, shit.
- What?

45:32.384 --> 45:34.433
Oh, my God, oh shit.

45:34.435 --> 45:35.935
- Oh, shit!
- Shit!

45:47.072 --> 45:50.217
Oh, what the fuck happened to him?

45:50.219 --> 45:53.468
Oh, my God, I think he shot himself.

45:53.470 --> 45:55.303
Something is going on.

46:02.719 --> 46:03.552
Careful.

46:06.489 --> 46:08.096
Should we call the police?

46:08.098 --> 46:09.478
Hell no, I am not
gettin' blamed for that.

46:09.480 --> 46:11.563
We need to get outa here.

46:30.387 --> 46:31.720
So, what's next?

46:38.072 --> 46:39.989
I don't know.

47:21.904 --> 47:23.270
So the library, huh?

47:24.773 --> 47:27.043
You do know there's this cool
thing called the internet?

47:27.045 --> 47:29.091
I don't know if you've heard of it.

47:29.093 --> 47:31.358
We're at the library because
some of the information

47:31.360 --> 47:34.659
I need might not be on the internet.

47:34.661 --> 47:37.217
Also, I can always get
more work done here,

47:37.219 --> 47:40.469
rather than at some little coffee shop.

47:42.221 --> 47:45.790
And what exactly
are we looking for?

47:45.792 --> 47:47.292
Not really sure.

48:00.041 --> 48:04.279
I did have a pretty weird
dream last night, though.

48:04.281 --> 48:06.198
It was about the house.

48:07.301 --> 48:08.666
There was this little girl there

48:08.668 --> 48:11.168
and someone called her Hei'an.

48:13.949 --> 48:18.107
I think she was a child
bride or something.

48:18.109 --> 48:21.776
Wait a second, you're
basing your research

48:22.800 --> 48:25.385
on a nightmare that you had?

48:25.387 --> 48:26.387
Yeah, but.

48:27.349 --> 48:30.158
Okay, I am almost positive
that I saw that little girl

48:30.160 --> 48:32.928
in the basement, standing behind Walter.

48:32.930 --> 48:34.939
She was just standing there,

48:34.941 --> 48:37.196
and then he goes to turn his light on her,

48:37.198 --> 48:38.865
but she disappeared.

48:40.661 --> 48:42.347
- Disappeared?
- Yeah.

48:42.349 --> 48:45.739
Like a ghost, disappeared?

48:45.741 --> 48:47.048
Maybe?

48:47.050 --> 48:49.666
I'm not buyin' into it.

48:49.668 --> 48:51.427
Enough crazy shit has
happened to us since

48:51.429 --> 48:53.659
we left that house to
warrant some questions.

48:53.661 --> 48:55.337
Don't you think?

48:55.339 --> 48:56.958
Yeah, no shit.

48:56.960 --> 48:59.099
If you'da told me a week ago
that Walter was gonna commit

48:59.101 --> 49:01.347
suicide and that I was
gonna find a dead redneck

49:01.349 --> 49:02.819
on the floor of an abandoned house,

49:02.821 --> 49:04.259
I would've said that you are having

49:04.261 --> 49:06.511
a bad acid trip, my friend.

49:09.320 --> 49:10.886
What are you lookin' at?

49:10.888 --> 49:14.747
So this says that the
second owner of the house,

49:14.749 --> 49:18.568
Charlotte Morgan, was arrested
multiple times between 1900

49:18.570 --> 49:23.570
and 1904 for different counts
of prostitution and pandering.

49:24.101 --> 49:28.601
In December, 1908, she sold
the house and disappeared.

49:29.621 --> 49:33.848
Okay, what good does
that do us now, though?

49:33.850 --> 49:38.017
It doesn't, but it's the
only lead that we have.

49:39.420 --> 49:41.888
So you're saying that
this child that you may

49:41.890 --> 49:44.939
or may not have seen,
might or might not be

49:44.941 --> 49:48.274
the ghost of a Chinese child prostitute?

49:49.730 --> 49:52.480
And she made Walter kill himself?

49:58.520 --> 50:00.968
I can't believe this.

50:00.970 --> 50:02.970
No, I can't believe you.

50:04.210 --> 50:05.986
No, no, no, no, you listen to me.

50:05.988 --> 50:08.573
Walter was one of my best
friends in the entire world

50:08.575 --> 50:09.855
and I cannot believe that you are doing

50:09.857 --> 50:11.607
this to me right now.

52:26.428 --> 52:27.684
Kelsey.

52:27.686 --> 52:28.935
Kelsey?

52:28.937 --> 52:30.270
Kelsey!

52:31.228 --> 52:33.228
Kelsey are you, oh shit!

52:36.397 --> 52:37.895
Move.

52:37.897 --> 52:39.923
Kelsey, oh, my God, Kelsey.

52:39.925 --> 52:41.508
Oh, my God, Kelsey.

52:56.878 --> 52:58.211
Can I come in?

53:11.370 --> 53:13.787
I'm sorry about your friends.

53:16.650 --> 53:18.808
If you wanna talk about anything,

53:18.810 --> 53:22.310
I just want you to know, I'm here for you.

53:25.758 --> 53:28.986
It's not even anything
you could understand.

53:28.988 --> 53:29.988
Maybe not.

53:36.959 --> 53:39.792
I think something is killing us.

53:42.770 --> 53:44.597
When I went out the other night,

53:44.599 --> 53:48.027
we went to this old abandoned house.

53:48.029 --> 53:52.946
We were gonna throw a little
party away from everyone else.

53:55.250 --> 53:59.167
But, I think that a ghost,
spirit or something,

54:00.330 --> 54:03.448
has been following us ever since.

54:03.450 --> 54:05.533
Making us kill ourselves.

54:11.530 --> 54:13.488
Okay, I don't even care what you think.

54:13.490 --> 54:15.387
I just wanted to tell somebody about it.

54:15.389 --> 54:17.306
It's okay, it's okay.

54:18.810 --> 54:22.037
You just promise you
won't tell Mom, okay?

54:22.039 --> 54:25.397
Maybe if there's something
occult in the works,

54:25.399 --> 54:28.699
we could find some kind
of ritual or something.

54:28.701 --> 54:31.668
Fuck it, if we're gonna die.

54:31.670 --> 54:33.715
I say let's do it together.

54:33.717 --> 54:36.717
What are you talking about?

54:36.719 --> 54:40.469
This has been by far the
shittiest week of my life.

54:40.471 --> 54:41.917
Two of my best friends are dead

54:41.919 --> 54:45.208
and now we're being hunted
by a fucking ghost child.

54:45.210 --> 54:46.440
I'm just sayin', I don't think that there

54:46.442 --> 54:48.229
is a way out of this.

54:48.231 --> 54:52.481
Okay so, you wanna just
give up and accept death?

54:55.599 --> 54:57.099
I mean, what do you want me to do?

54:57.101 --> 54:58.916
We're runnin' out of options here.

54:58.918 --> 55:00.886
I mean, we're dyin'.

55:00.888 --> 55:01.719
What?

55:01.721 --> 55:03.715
Okay, you know, I really
didn't think that you were

55:03.717 --> 55:06.566
the kinda guy that
would give up so easily.

55:06.568 --> 55:09.143
Well I don't think you
understand the situation.

55:09.145 --> 55:10.886
We are going to die, Sarah.

55:10.888 --> 55:13.332
There's no way outa this.

55:13.334 --> 55:14.251
Says who?

55:18.485 --> 55:19.902
Sarah, come on.

55:36.805 --> 55:38.635
You know, I don't give a shit whether

55:38.637 --> 55:42.134
or not you wanna quit, but
I'm not gonna stop looking

55:42.136 --> 55:44.483
until I'm dead like Kelsey and Walter

55:44.485 --> 55:46.344
or until I can end this thing,

55:46.346 --> 55:49.846
and you can either help me or you can die.

55:56.094 --> 55:58.014
So we'll just talk to her.

55:58.016 --> 55:59.971
It will be fine.

55:59.973 --> 56:02.122
We should've called you sooner.

56:02.124 --> 56:03.451
I'm here to help.

56:03.453 --> 56:05.010
- Thank you.
- It's no problem.

56:05.012 --> 56:07.291
Oh, here she is now.

56:07.293 --> 56:08.210
Hey, Sarah.

56:10.242 --> 56:13.539
Hey, Sarah, I want you
to come meet Dr. Schafer.

56:13.541 --> 56:15.261
Pleased to meet you, Sarah.

56:15.263 --> 56:17.277
Please, sit down.

56:17.279 --> 56:19.362
Let's have a little chat.

56:20.434 --> 56:22.291
What is this?

56:22.293 --> 56:24.931
Well, actually, it's about you, Sarah.

56:24.933 --> 56:26.392
Your parents have become worried enough

56:26.394 --> 56:28.477
that they asked for help.

56:30.091 --> 56:32.032
So you're a shrink?

56:32.034 --> 56:35.201
Sarah, your mom and dad tell me that

56:36.101 --> 56:39.261
you have had some friends
commit suicide recently

56:39.263 --> 56:43.091
and that you're having
some hallucinations.

56:43.093 --> 56:45.569
We're just worried that
you've experienced some trauma

56:45.571 --> 56:49.803
from losing so many people in
such a short period of time.

56:49.805 --> 56:51.301
Sorry, I really, I can't do this.

56:51.303 --> 56:52.552
- Sarah, wait.
- Please just stop.

56:52.554 --> 56:54.760
Hold on, let her go.

56:54.762 --> 56:57.451
Let's leave her alone for now.

56:57.453 --> 56:59.752
She's gonna be okay, right?

56:59.754 --> 57:01.042
Fuck.

57:01.044 --> 57:01.877
God.

57:04.343 --> 57:05.260
Oh, my God.

57:12.652 --> 57:13.985
God, that bitch.

57:15.650 --> 57:18.233
Oh, my God, are you kidding me?

57:21.644 --> 57:22.644
Fuckin' God.

57:52.732 --> 57:54.370
Molly, go down to the basement

57:54.372 --> 57:57.789
and get us a couple more bottles of wine.

58:17.400 --> 58:18.419
Oh, God.

58:18.421 --> 58:19.671
Miss Charlotte.

58:29.200 --> 58:31.107
Go back up and tend
to the customers, child.

58:31.109 --> 58:31.940
But Miss Charlotte.

58:31.942 --> 58:33.025
I said, go.

58:36.809 --> 58:37.726
Poor child.

58:39.788 --> 58:41.455
Waste not, want not.

01:01:50.703 --> 01:01:51.534
Yes?

01:01:51.536 --> 01:01:54.619
Good morning, is Sarah in?

01:01:56.217 --> 01:01:58.717
What's this have to do with?

01:02:00.137 --> 01:02:03.554
This man here, his name is Josh Sloane.

01:02:04.815 --> 01:02:07.586
A friend of his found his body recently

01:02:07.588 --> 01:02:09.755
in a band rehearsal space.

01:02:11.063 --> 01:02:15.807
His roommate, Kelsey Cox, was
also found recently deceased.

01:02:15.809 --> 01:02:16.892
Oh, my God.

01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:20.367
Sarah was a friend of both of theirs,

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:22.138
and my understanding is she may have been

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:24.858
the last person to see him alive.

01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:28.193
I would like to ask her a few questions.

01:02:29.801 --> 01:02:30.976
Sure, she's upstairs.

01:02:30.978 --> 01:02:32.439
I'll go get her.

01:02:32.441 --> 01:02:33.858
Is she a suspect?

01:02:37.070 --> 01:02:39.327
The owner of the practice
space said he heard Sarah

01:02:39.329 --> 01:02:42.237
and Josh have an argument
the night before.

01:02:42.239 --> 01:02:44.906
We really can't assume anything.

01:02:48.761 --> 01:02:50.844
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

01:03:19.641 --> 01:03:21.058
She's not here.

01:03:25.249 --> 01:03:27.487
She must be at the library.

01:03:27.489 --> 01:03:29.787
She goes early when it's not too busy.

01:03:29.789 --> 01:03:31.807
She does a lot of research there.

01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:34.058
She's trying to be a writer.

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:37.719
Dispatch, I'm gonna need a BOLO.

01:03:37.721 --> 01:03:40.471
Person of interest, Sarah Jensen.

01:03:41.758 --> 01:03:44.091
Brunette, Caucasian, female.

01:03:46.186 --> 01:03:47.087
Five foot, nine.

01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:51.506
Five foot, nine, about
115 pounds, 24 years of age.

01:03:54.215 --> 01:03:59.215
You will need to contact me if
she calls or if she comes by.

01:04:00.997 --> 01:04:01.830
Thank you.

01:04:11.409 --> 01:04:13.992
That asshole left his folder.

01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:45.203
It's fucking ridiculous.

01:04:45.205 --> 01:04:46.038
Fuck.

01:05:04.448 --> 01:05:08.054
One other person, a young asian
girl known only as Hei'an,

01:05:08.056 --> 01:05:12.694
has said to have been seen
at the premises recently.

01:05:12.696 --> 01:05:13.529
Hei'an.

01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:48.197
Son of a bitch.

01:09:00.009 --> 01:09:02.167
Dispatch, I'm gonna need
backup at my location.

01:09:02.169 --> 01:09:03.502
I've got a body.

01:10:06.630 --> 01:10:07.776
Hey, Sarah Jensen.

01:10:07.778 --> 01:10:08.992
Oh, my God.

01:10:08.994 --> 01:10:10.992
Okay, sweetheart, I'm
gonna have to ask you to drop

01:10:10.994 --> 01:10:13.863
that weapon and get your
hands up where I can see 'em.

01:10:13.865 --> 01:10:16.198
What the fuck is going on?

01:10:17.111 --> 01:10:20.004
What's going on is we're
gonna have a little chat

01:10:20.006 --> 01:10:24.256
about your dead friends
Kelsey Cox and Josh Sloane.

01:10:26.792 --> 01:10:27.623
Drop it.

01:10:27.625 --> 01:10:28.983
But Josh Sloane isn't dead.

01:10:28.985 --> 01:10:29.816
- Drop it.
- Fuck.

01:10:29.818 --> 01:10:31.158
Turn around, get 'em up.

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:32.743
Yeah, Josh is dead.

01:10:34.007 --> 01:10:35.878
What the fuck is that?

01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:37.330
What is that?

01:10:37.332 --> 01:10:38.381
You fucked us.

01:10:38.383 --> 01:10:40.488
Don't you fuckin' move.

01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:42.457
Dispatch this is Parker,
where's that backup?

01:10:42.459 --> 01:10:43.670
Please, just let me do
this, you don't know...

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:44.505
Shut up!

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:49.464
Dispatch, this is Parker, do you copy?

01:10:49.466 --> 01:10:50.555
You don't know what the
fuck you're doing, dude.

01:10:50.557 --> 01:10:51.388
- Dispatch.
- You don't know

01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:52.279
what you're doing!

01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:54.287
- Okay, fuck you.
- Jesus christ.

01:10:55.256 --> 01:10:56.646
Get off.

01:10:56.648 --> 01:10:57.479
Hey, get off!

01:10:57.481 --> 01:10:59.940
Let's go, up, up, up.

01:10:59.942 --> 01:11:00.775
Let's go.

01:11:01.787 --> 01:11:04.152
Up, we need to talk about it.

01:11:05.025 --> 01:11:06.799
- Open the door!
- Oh, my God.

01:11:06.801 --> 01:11:07.977
Open the fucking door.

01:11:07.979 --> 01:11:11.434
This isn't
me I'm not doing this.

01:11:11.436 --> 01:11:13.982
I'm trying to, I'm only
trying to help you.

01:11:13.984 --> 01:11:15.651
Open the god damn.

01:11:30.636 --> 01:11:32.469
Officer down, officer.

01:12:58.047 --> 01:12:59.130
Oh, my God.

01:12:59.974 --> 01:13:00.807
Hei'an.

01:13:05.483 --> 01:13:07.071
Hei'an.

01:13:07.073 --> 01:13:08.733
Hei'an.

01:13:08.735 --> 01:13:09.985
Hey look at me.

01:13:13.916 --> 01:13:15.833
I can help you, please.

01:13:19.162 --> 01:13:20.804
Hei'an, I can help you.

01:13:20.806 --> 01:13:21.889
Please, quit.

01:13:56.213 --> 01:13:57.130
Oh, my God.

01:14:00.049 --> 01:14:01.161
Thank you, God.

01:14:31.885 --> 01:14:34.718
Hello, Sarah, how did you sleep?

01:14:38.181 --> 01:14:42.513
Dr. Robinson tells me that he
has changed your medication

01:14:42.515 --> 01:14:43.861
to something a little stronger

01:14:43.863 --> 01:14:46.613
to help you with your nightmares.

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.981
I know this not ideal,
but you're gonna have

01:14:51.983 --> 01:14:53.733
to work through this.

01:14:54.647 --> 01:14:56.834
These delusions that you're having

01:14:56.836 --> 01:15:00.253
about your friends and this spirit child.

01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:02.937
When did they begin?

01:15:07.485 --> 01:15:09.818
I'm just trying to help you.

01:15:11.349 --> 01:15:14.182
Things will get better, I promise.

01:15:20.667 --> 01:15:23.750
Don't make promises you can't keep.
