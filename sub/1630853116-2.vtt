for the key.

48:30.733 --> 48:33.200
What is the point
in a spinet

48:33.200 --> 48:34.433

Leonora, what are you wearing?!

48:40.566 --> 48:43.233
Miss Heywood said a woman
can dress for whatever

48:43.233 --> 48:44.733
suits her purpose.

48:44.733 --> 48:48.800
She says a girl can be whatever
she wants to be.

CHARLOTTE:
I have tried,
Mr. Colbourne.

48:52.633 --> 48:54.733
And like those before you,
you have failed.

48:54.733 --> 48:56.433
No, sir.

48:56.433 --> 48:58.200
I shall not shoulder
that burden alone.

48:58.200 --> 49:00.033
You told me I'm not here
to educate you,

49:00.033 --> 49:02.900
but there is much
you have to learn.

49:02.900 --> 49:05.833
Miss Colbourne lacks a mother
and also a father.

49:05.833 --> 49:07.166
She lost the former
to the grave

49:07.166 --> 49:08.966
and the latter to his work.

49:08.966 --> 49:11.100
And Miss Markham,

49:11.100 --> 49:13.233
were she to let anyone in,
might become a woman

49:13.233 --> 49:14.566
of lively intellect,

49:14.566 --> 49:17.100
ready to step into society,
as you desire.

49:17.100 --> 49:19.266
But who listens to her?

49:19.266 --> 49:21.266
Who even speaks
in this house of silence,

49:21.266 --> 49:23.566
this mausoleum?

49:23.566 --> 49:27.033
So, this may be the last lesson
I teach in this house,

49:27.033 --> 49:29.166
but it is decidedly
the most pertinent!

49:29.166 --> 49:32.133
You wish to leave?

49:33.400 --> 49:34.800
No, but I assumed...

49:34.800 --> 49:37.966
