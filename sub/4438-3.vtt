00:04.086 --> 00:05.805
Who wants Stan-cakes?

00:05.964 --> 00:07.341
They're like pancakes,

00:07.549 --> 00:08.516
but they probably have
some of my hair in 'em.

00:08.717 --> 00:09.639
Pass.

00:09.801 --> 00:10.597
It's here!

00:10.761 --> 00:11.887
Aahh!

00:12.095 --> 00:13.347
Oh, it's here! It's here!
It's here! It's here!

00:13.555 --> 00:14.602
I've been waiting
all morning

00:14.765 --> 00:16.233
and it's finally here!

00:16.433 --> 00:18.606
<i>The Gravity Falls Gossiper

00:21.104 --> 00:23.482
My picture is gonna be
in the newspaper!

00:23.690 --> 00:25.067
Check it!

00:25.275 --> 00:28.279
"Pacifica Northwest declares
V-necks the look of the season."

00:28.487 --> 00:29.534
What am I
looking at here?

00:29.738 --> 00:30.660
Wha-wha-what?

00:33.242 --> 00:35.665
Looks like someone bought
their way to the front page.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.122
Is it legal for a child
to wear that much make-up?

00:38.330 --> 00:39.877
Ugh. Pacifica.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.667
She always
ruins everything.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.127
Aww, cheer up,
Mabel.

00:43.335 --> 00:44.803
I mean, no one even reads
newspapers anymore.

00:44.962 --> 00:45.884
Dudes!

00:46.088 --> 00:48.307
V-neck season is upon us!

00:48.507 --> 00:50.100
Who wants to help me get
ahead of the fashion curve?

00:50.300 --> 00:51.552
I'm taking it
one step further

00:51.718 --> 00:54.062
with the W-neck!

00:54.263 --> 00:56.607
Must. Follow.
Newspaper.

01:01.770 --> 01:04.147
I need something to get
my mind off this.

you love mini-golf!

01:20.747 --> 01:22.841
She's been amazing at it
since we were kids.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.126
What do you say, Mabel?

01:24.334 --> 01:25.381
We've had a stressful
couple of days.

01:25.586 --> 01:26.883
How about
we take a break, huh?

01:27.087 --> 01:29.510
Would kicking all our butts
at mini-golf cheer you up?

01:29.715 --> 01:30.591
Maybe a little.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.517

The sport of mini-champions.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.204
The grass is fake
but the fun is real.

03:13.068 --> 03:13.990
Yes!

Ah, don't worry about it, kid.
The thing's random.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.502
Yeah, besides
the Bermuda's Triangle,

04:04.703 --> 04:06.956
how mini golf works
is the world's greatest mystery.

04:07.122 --> 04:08.374
As far as I'm concerned,

04:08.582 --> 04:11.506
you're still better than
anyone else is Gravity--

04:11.710 --> 04:12.711
(all gasp)

04:12.919 --> 04:14.546
Oh, would you
look at that?

I didn't know it was
"hobos golf free" day.

04:17.173 --> 04:19.471
Pacifica!

04:19.676 --> 04:21.599
Well, if it isn't
the Pines family.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.891
Fat, old,
lame, braces.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.567
Soos, would it be wrong
to punch a child?

04:27.768 --> 04:28.394
I've got this.

04:28.560 --> 04:29.652
Hey, Pacifica,

04:29.853 --> 04:31.605
how's that whole
your-family-being-frauds thing

04:31.813 --> 04:32.609
working out for you?

04:32.814 --> 04:33.986
Great, actually.

04:34.191 --> 04:35.317
That's the thing
about money.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.198
It makes problems
go away.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.203
Well, can't buy you skill.

04:39.362 --> 04:41.785
You walked into the game
of the mini golf champion.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.992
Sergei!

04:44.159 --> 04:45.786
This is Sergei,
my trainer.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.088
The Sportlympics had
mini golf once.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.380
I took gold!

04:49.581 --> 04:50.753
So if you don't mind

moving out of the way
of the professionals...

Stop at once!

05:33.124 --> 05:35.047
The park is now closed
due to weather.

05:35.252 --> 05:37.846

has spoken.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.597
Oh, the King is down!

You. Me. Midnight.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.311
We'll see who's best.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.308
I'll be here.

05:46.513 --> 05:47.639
( Thunder crashing )

05:52.727 --> 05:54.729
I'll be here.

05:54.938 --> 05:57.737
Peh, peh!
Hair in my mouth. Peh!

06:09.077 --> 06:10.374
( Sighs )

06:10.579 --> 06:13.332
Time to scratch mini golf off
my talents list.

06:13.540 --> 06:14.792
Aww,
don't give up, Mabel.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.673
Yeah,
if you beat her at this,

06:16.877 --> 06:18.174
she could never
rag on you again.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.300
Imagine it.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.674
Um, the section
for ugly grandma clothes

06:22.841 --> 06:23.467
is over there.

06:23.675 --> 06:24.676
Oh, yeah?

06:24.843 --> 06:25.810
Well, the section
for people

06:26.011 --> 06:28.855
who lost at mini golf
is over there!

06:31.308 --> 06:32.730
We came
as fast as we could.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.028
We heard a little girl
got seriously burned!

06:35.228 --> 06:36.605
TOGETHER: Oh!

06:36.813 --> 06:38.611
I'm ruined!

06:38.815 --> 06:39.657
Up top!

06:39.858 --> 06:40.734
TOGETHER: Yay!

06:42.277 --> 06:43.620
You're right, guys.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.697
I just need to practice
a little more before midnight.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.500
Go to the golf course
after dark, you say?

06:48.700 --> 06:50.577
I don't know.
We'd have to break in and--

06:50.785 --> 06:52.162
Just kidding!
Let's break in!

06:52.370 --> 06:53.963
( Tires screeching )

07:01.796 --> 07:03.764
0h, and, hey, Mabel!

What?
What is it?

Yeah.

Are you guys tiny humans?
Or enormous mini-humans?

Neither.
We're lilli-putt-tians!

08:16.204 --> 08:17.501
Lilli-- Lilli-putt...

08:17.706 --> 08:19.379
The name makes more sense
written out than spoken.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.586
And we control the balls!
Behold!

08:32.011 --> 08:32.979
BOTH: WOW!

08:38.934 --> 08:41.734
( Yodeling )

08:45.025 --> 08:46.618
That's incredible!

08:46.818 --> 08:48.570
And so needlessly
complicated.

08:48.778 --> 08:49.870
Aw, shucks.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.539
It's only our
life-long passion!

08:51.740 --> 08:53.868
Would you like us
to elaborate through song?

Nah, we're good.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.087
So what are you hugelings
doing here anyway?

09:02.292 --> 09:04.044
We kind of have to play
this golf tournament

09:04.252 --> 09:06.095
against my rival,
Pacifica.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.798
Oh, rivals.
Rivals, rivals.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.513
Oh, we know
all about rivals.

Put a clog in it,
ya windmill lubbers!

09:15.055 --> 09:17.558
These really bottom
popinjays are terrible

09:17.766 --> 09:19.518
at controlling the balls!

09:19.684 --> 09:22.403
We are the ball masters,
says I!

09:22.562 --> 09:24.360
( Pirates laughing
and cheering )

09:24.522 --> 09:26.775
Shut your mouths,
you showboating pirates!

09:26.983 --> 09:28.576
Everyone knows
the Eiffel Tower hole

09:28.777 --> 09:29.778
is the best!

09:32.530 --> 09:35.750
Stay thee your comments,
ye scurrilous Frenchmen!

09:37.327 --> 09:39.045
None controllable
is better

09:39.245 --> 09:40.246
than the knights of...

09:40.455 --> 09:42.128
Wiener castle.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.424
Who wrote this?

09:43.625 --> 09:44.626

which hole is best!

Attack!

09:45.794 --> 09:46.670
Charge!

09:46.878 --> 09:48.972
Ooh, I'm shiverin'
in me timbers.

09:49.172 --> 09:50.139
Get ready to die!

09:51.549 --> 09:53.847
Long live the mini king!

09:55.095 --> 09:56.688
Die, you evil scum!

09:56.888 --> 09:57.764
Ow!

09:57.972 --> 09:58.814
Ya rr!

( laughs )

10:06.564 --> 10:07.907
These guys are a riot.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.611
GUYS, guys, calm down.

10:10.819 --> 10:13.538
Your fighting is
inadvertently adorable.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.787
Adorable we are, hugeling,
but our tale, less so.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.289
Every hole in the park thinks
that it's superior.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.212
From the cowboys
in the east

10:21.412 --> 10:23.039
to the grimy minors
of the south.

10:23.248 --> 10:26.468
If only there was some way
to decide which side is best

10:26.668 --> 10:28.511
with maybe an award or,
like a trophy.

10:28.711 --> 10:29.507
I don't know.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.635
But, Franz, look!

10:33.800 --> 10:34.767
A sticker.
Sticker.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.517
The sticker.
The sticker could decide!

10:37.679 --> 10:39.556
It does say
"the best" on it.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.019
Decide for us, hugeling.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.773
Choose which mini kingdom
to give the sticker to

10:43.977 --> 10:45.445
and end our war!

10:45.603 --> 10:46.525
( Mini people cheering )

10:46.729 --> 10:47.525
Uh,

10:47.730 --> 10:48.856
I don't know, guys.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.612
I'm not sure
I want to get involved

10:50.817 --> 10:53.240
in your
weird mini blood feud.

10:53.403 --> 10:54.279
Psst!

10:54.487 --> 10:55.534
Mabel,
this is perfect.

10:55.738 --> 10:56.739
These guys
control the course.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.495
Just tell them
you'll give the sticker

10:58.700 --> 11:01.203
to whichever group does
a better job of helping us win.

11:01.411 --> 11:02.663
I'm not sure, Dipper.

11:02.871 --> 11:03.793
I want to beat Pacifica,

11:03.997 --> 11:06.671
but doesn't this seem like
cheating?

11:06.875 --> 11:10.721
Pacifica's rich, Mabel.
She's cheating at life.

11:10.879 --> 11:12.802
Hmm.

11:12.964 --> 11:13.886
( Blows horn )

11:14.090 --> 11:15.012
Thanks, man.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.684
People of the 18 holes!

11:16.843 --> 11:18.891
We're going to have
a game of mini-golf!

11:19.095 --> 11:21.314
And whoever does
the best job helping me win

11:21.514 --> 11:23.016
gets the sticker!

11:23.224 --> 11:25.943
It'll be us, lass,
not these tulip munchers.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.646
I will not be insulted

11:27.854 --> 11:30.607
by a man with no depth
perception wearing earrings.

11:30.815 --> 11:31.657
Just remember,

11:31.858 --> 11:33.155
as long as
you're helping me,

11:33.359 --> 11:34.281
no fighting.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.576
Dude, I'm cutting
"W"s into all my shirts.

11:40.783 --> 11:41.909
Got to give the public
what they want.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.870
Well, the kids
are taking their time.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.671
Looks like
it's gonna be a while.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.760
( Romantic ballad
playing on radio )

11:55.798 --> 11:57.516
Sure are a lot of stars
out tonight.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.264
Well,
this is gettin' weird.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.934
Now remember, Pacifica,
winning is everything.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.519
Oh, oh, and also looks.
Winning and looks.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.025
Dad, I've been practicing for,
like, a millions hours, okay?

12:10.230 --> 12:11.356
I've got this.

12:11.522 --> 12:12.569
You'll stay to watch,
right?

12:12.774 --> 12:14.902
Pacifica, darling.
We have a party to go to.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.907
We'll just read about
your victory in the paper.

12:18.029 --> 12:19.155
Sergei!
( snaps fingers )

12:21.282 --> 12:24.286
Oh, and whatever happens,
just remember one thing.

12:24.494 --> 12:25.495
You're a Northwest.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.125
Don't lose.

12:29.290 --> 12:32.089
How much do you want to bet
they're no shows?

12:34.420 --> 12:35.672
Looking for someone?

12:35.838 --> 12:37.932
Waiting in the dark
and not creepy at all.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.258
Seriously, though?

12:39.467 --> 12:40.639
I don't know
why you bothered to come.

12:40.802 --> 12:42.099
Unless you've got
something up your sleeve.

12:42.303 --> 12:45.557
Oh, I guess you could say
we've got a little something.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.145
Right? Right?

12:47.350 --> 12:48.818
( laughs )

12:49.018 --> 12:50.144
( giggle nervously )

12:51.604 --> 12:53.106
Eighteen holes.
Standard rules.

12:53.314 --> 12:56.363
Winner lives in glory.
Loser wallows in eternal shame.

12:56.567 --> 12:57.409
On your mark,

12:57.610 --> 13:00.238
Get set, Mini golf!

13:14.002 --> 13:15.003
What?

13:16.421 --> 13:17.388
ALL: Yeehaw!

13:26.639 --> 13:27.561
Out of my way!

13:27.724 --> 13:28.771
(grunts)

13:31.811 --> 13:33.358
Are you serious?

13:33.521 --> 13:34.864
( Cheering )

13:36.649 --> 13:38.026
Yarr, I 58V!

13:42.864 --> 13:44.582
( laughs )
Miner hole.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.376
I wonder what cute silly things
are going on down there.

13:50.496 --> 13:51.622
Stop!

13:51.831 --> 13:53.754
You can't go in there!
There's been a gas leak.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.507
Anyone who goes in there
will die!

13:56.711 --> 13:59.260
( Chattering )

13:59.464 --> 14:00.340
I will take it.

14:00.548 --> 14:01.549
[[511

14:01.758 --> 14:04.261
Don't go, Big Henry!
We need you!

14:04.469 --> 14:06.016
Go home, Polly.

14:13.144 --> 14:14.646
Ahem.

14:17.273 --> 14:20.026
Come on, Big Henry.
You can do this.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.116
( Groaning )

14:38.836 --> 14:39.803
Aah! No!

14:40.713 --> 14:42.636
Sergei! Soda! Now!

14:44.092 --> 14:47.517
Okay, guys,
that was badonkulous!

14:47.678 --> 14:48.725
Hey, hey.
Little high fives, everyone.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.056
Little high fives
all around.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.517
Nice one. You did it.
You're the man!

14:52.683 --> 14:53.775
I don't want to
call it out early,

14:53.976 --> 14:55.603
but I think
the Miners might have

14:55.812 --> 14:58.190
one of these in their future.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.025
( Miners cheering )

15:02.819 --> 15:03.866
Are you kidding me?

15:04.070 --> 15:05.697
After everything
we've worked for?

15:05.905 --> 15:07.282
Calm yourself, Franz.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.913
There may be another way
to win the hugelings' favor.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.040
Knock on wood.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.503
There's something going on,
Sergei.

15:16.707 --> 15:17.959
I can feel it.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.670
Maybe they has little people
who control where balls go.

15:20.878 --> 15:21.629
Whew!

15:21.838 --> 15:23.135
We got to get you
English lessons.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.556
I mean, think about it.
I'm globally ranked.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.259
It's ridiculous that
she's beating me.

15:28.344 --> 15:31.473
Ugh, Pitt Cola.
I always forget about the pit.

15:31.639 --> 15:34.358
Get me a different one,
Sergei.

15:34.559 --> 15:35.401
Huh?

15:35.560 --> 15:36.482
( Screams )

15:37.645 --> 15:38.646
This is bad.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.533
I can't wait to see
the look on Pacifica's face

15:42.733 --> 15:43.700
when we win.

15:43.901 --> 15:44.902
I'm thinking it will be like...

15:46.028 --> 15:47.530
You know
how she does that?

15:47.738 --> 15:48.785
Dipper, is it bad

15:48.990 --> 15:50.958
that I feel good
about her feeling bad?

15:51.159 --> 15:53.082
Just enjoy your victory,
Mabel.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.414
Trust me,
Pacifica will be fine.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.669
( Pacifica screams )

15:57.874 --> 16:00.377
What's going on here?
Let me go!

16:00.585 --> 16:03.304
( Screaming )

16:03.504 --> 16:04.471
What did I miss?

16:05.756 --> 16:07.724
Let rne go,
YOU creeps!

16:07.884 --> 16:09.511
Welcome, twins!
Welcome!

16:09.719 --> 16:10.971
I can tell
you're loving this, right?

16:11.179 --> 16:12.601
Right? No?

16:12.763 --> 16:13.889
What are you guys
doing?

16:14.098 --> 16:15.941
This wasn't part of the deal,
tiny Dutchman!

16:16.142 --> 16:18.486
Okay, so we saw
you were favoring

16:18.644 --> 16:19.896
the Miners
and we figured,

16:20.104 --> 16:21.856
what's better than
beating Pacifica?

16:22.064 --> 16:23.281
Pfft!

16:23.441 --> 16:24.613
Killing her, right?

16:24.817 --> 16:27.240
As if.
I'm calling my parents.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.370
Where is my phone?

16:28.571 --> 16:29.663
(giggling )

16:29.864 --> 16:30.490
Send.

16:30.698 --> 16:31.915
Hey, hey!

16:32.116 --> 16:34.539
So how about it, hugeling?
Who's the best now?

16:34.744 --> 16:37.998
PIRATE:
Not so fast, landlubbers!

16:38.164 --> 16:40.542
If you're going to
play dirty, so are we.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.674
Now give us the sticker
or he walks the plank.

16:43.878 --> 16:44.925
No, give us the sticker!

16:45.129 --> 16:46.472
The Miners!
The sticker's for the Miners!

16:46.672 --> 16:49.300
Give it to us!
Give it to us!

16:49.509 --> 16:50.852
Remember Big Henry!

16:51.052 --> 16:51.974
Enough!

16:53.888 --> 16:55.060
( Qasps )

16:55.264 --> 16:57.141
You know what?
No one gets the sticker!

16:57.350 --> 16:59.478
( Booing )

16:59.644 --> 17:01.146
No. No. Nuh-uh.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.356
No booing.
Stop. No.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.321
No one gets the sticker
'cause you're all being jerks.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.493
I mean,
why can't you just get along?

17:08.694 --> 17:10.742
Because
we hate each other.

17:10.946 --> 17:13.496
That's kinda
how rivalries work, lass.

17:13.699 --> 17:14.746
Well then maybe...

17:15.910 --> 17:17.412
Maybe rivalries
are dumb.

17:17.619 --> 17:20.339
Maybe you don't settle them
with petty competitions.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.792
Maybe the only way to be
"the best"

17:22.959 --> 17:24.632
is by ending the fighting

17:24.835 --> 17:25.882
and working together!

17:27.463 --> 17:29.306
<i>( Qtflps ')</i>

17:29.507 --> 17:31.885
( mini people gasp
and murmur)

17:32.093 --> 17:33.060
It's all so clear.

17:33.261 --> 17:35.389
If we work together...

17:35.596 --> 17:38.645
Then we can cut open her belly
and get the sticker.

17:38.849 --> 17:39.600
( Pirates cheering )

17:39.809 --> 17:41.482
Get the girl!
Slice her open!

17:43.312 --> 17:45.656
You guys aren't appreciating
the lesson here!

17:45.856 --> 17:48.109
ALL: Sticker!
Sticker! Sticker!

17:50.903 --> 17:53.907
( Screaming )
Help!

17:55.032 --> 17:56.204
We've got to get out of here!

17:56.409 --> 17:58.582
I have to save Pacifica first!

18:10.548 --> 18:11.765
After her!

18:11.966 --> 18:13.718
Ah, Mr. Dipper!
"Yet! <i>Nyet!</i>

18:13.926 --> 18:16.099
Don't freak out, man!
The water's shallow!

18:16.304 --> 18:18.102
There is literally
no way to drown.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.230
Seriously?

18:23.686 --> 18:25.780
Ugh, took you long enough.
And watch the earrings!

18:25.980 --> 18:27.402
They're worth
more than your house!

18:27.565 --> 18:30.159
You know, on second thought,
maybe I won't untie you.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.656
Untie me!
Untie me!

18:31.861 --> 18:33.238
That's what I thought.

18:33.404 --> 18:34.530
( 985D )

18:34.739 --> 18:36.787
We have you
on miniature pencilpoint.

18:36.991 --> 18:38.493
There's no way around us.

18:38.701 --> 18:39.918
You ready to putt?

18:40.119 --> 18:41.336
Way ahead of you.

18:42.913 --> 18:44.005
ALL: Huh?

18:45.916 --> 18:47.918
Hey, you're actually
not that terrible.

18:48.127 --> 18:48.923
A little rusty, but...

18:49.128 --> 18:50.630
Just shut up and putt!

18:54.050 --> 18:55.302
Get on! Get on!

18:55.509 --> 18:56.476

19:15.112 --> 19:16.204
I'll get a new one.

19:18.199 --> 19:19.075
They're shutting us in!

19:19.241 --> 19:20.413
( Exclaims )

19:23.537 --> 19:24.959
Don't even think about it.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.499
You call yourself a golfer?

19:26.707 --> 19:29.631
Without us, that club
is useless in your hands.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.679
Oh yeah?
What's ten minus six?

19:32.838 --> 19:33.839
Ten-- Hang on.

you dumb hugelings!

We're done with you.

19:55.069 --> 19:56.571
What did you say,
you little trolls?

19:56.779 --> 19:57.826
I will sue you.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.124
I will sue you
and I will own you.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.955
( Gasping )

20:02.159 --> 20:03.502
You two.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.376
I don't know what you did
or what's going on,

20:05.579 --> 20:07.832
but if you think just
because you saved my life, I--

20:10.793 --> 20:12.386
I'm sorry, Pacifica.

20:12.586 --> 20:13.633
We shouldn't
have cheated.

20:13.838 --> 20:16.591
You totally would've
beat me fair and square.

20:18.092 --> 20:20.220
You're just lucky this sticker
looks fantastic on me.

20:20.428 --> 20:21.429

Hey!
You're parents aren't here.

20:28.561 --> 20:29.813
You want a ride home?

Puh-leaze,
as if I'd ride in your--

♪ Can't really see
where I'm goin' ♪

20:41.198 --> 20:42.120
Ugh!

20:42.283 --> 20:43.705
Hey, I found two tacos!

20:45.828 --> 20:47.876
You're allowed
to eat in the car?

20:48.038 --> 20:51.167
Yeah, the car is where
secret surprise snacks happen.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.501
Want one?

20:52.710 --> 20:54.508
Oh, I'm not supposed
to take handouts.

20:54.712 --> 20:57.340
Handouts?
It's called sharing!

20:57.548 --> 21:00.222
You do know
what sharing is, right?

21:00.426 --> 21:02.178
Shar-- Shaar-ing?

21:02.386 --> 21:03.603
Just take it.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.566
Thanks for the ride,
or whatever.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.565
Oh, and Mabel...

21:09.769 --> 21:13.615
I can't believe I'm saying this
but I had fun.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.691
And tell your servant
I like his W neck!

21:16.734 --> 21:18.407
Yes!

21:18.611 --> 21:20.579
So are you guys, like,
cool now?

21:20.780 --> 21:22.453
I think we made
some progress.

21:22.656 --> 21:23.908
The important thing
to remember is that

21:24.116 --> 21:25.117
at the end of the day,

21:25.326 --> 21:27.704
she's just an ordinary kid
like us.

21:32.500 --> 21:33.968
Should've charged her
for that taco.
