03:09.439 --> 03:10.899
Do you like women, Jimmy?

03:13.902 --> 03:15.112
What do you think?

03:19.575 --> 03:20.701
I love 'em.

03:20.784 --> 03:21.994
Yeah?

03:32.796 --> 03:34.298
What do you like about them?

03:37.134 --> 03:41.138
I like… their softness.

03:43.098 --> 03:45.601
The way their hands feel in mine.
Making 'em laugh.

03:46.185 --> 03:47.477
Blondes or brunettes?

03:50.105 --> 03:55.027
I've dated every type.
Blonde, Asian, short, tall.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.653
Big tits, small tits?

03:58.405 --> 03:59.489
All kinds.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.741
But good tits?

04:02.659 --> 04:03.660
You don't like saggy tits,

04:03.744 --> 04:06.413
or tits that point
in different directions?

04:08.665 --> 04:09.583
Not for you.

04:09.666 --> 04:13.462
Okay. So, outside of hotness,
great tits, great ass, great hair--

04:13.545 --> 04:18.091
Wait, you don't get hung up on hair.
What do you like about women?

04:20.802 --> 04:21.803
Everything.

04:23.472 --> 04:24.598
I got sisters.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.525
Women are more…

04:36.527 --> 04:37.528
kind.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.949
I can chill with a woman
in a way I never could with a dude.

04:44.743 --> 04:47.079
I can just be.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.582
But what do you like about them?

04:55.087 --> 04:56.380
I like this.

05:00.008 --> 05:03.053
I'm not saying
anything's gonna happen, but…

05:06.974 --> 05:08.100
possibility's there.

05:10.102 --> 05:12.020
What don't you like about women?

05:13.522 --> 05:14.523
Nothing.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.318
What do you think
Larry Hall doesn't like about women?

05:20.237 --> 05:23.365
How the fuck do I know?

05:23.448 --> 05:24.867
So, what good are you to me?

05:28.453 --> 05:31.123
You show me you can find
common ground with this man,

05:31.206 --> 05:32.666
or you are wasting my time.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.716
You said you dreamed of killing women?

05:46.388 --> 05:48.640
You said you dreamed of killing women.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.270
Larry.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.399
What? I dre-- It's not like that.

05:57.482 --> 06:01.612
No, I don't dream of killing women.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.198
I just have a lot of dreams
from killing them.

06:04.281 --> 06:08.285
You know. And Gary says
that he has a lot of dreams about falling.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.912
Uh-huh. Who's Gary?

06:11.747 --> 06:12.748
My twin.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.128
Gary also once told me

06:18.212 --> 06:20.714
that he has a lot of dreams
about drowning.

06:21.423 --> 06:24.092
But not killing women, right?
That's more your thing.

06:25.511 --> 06:28.597
And tell me
what these dreams are like, Larry.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.518
The dreams are like--

06:33.769 --> 06:35.145
It's like…

06:37.606 --> 06:41.026
I'm kinda looking down on myself,
like I'm not in my body.

06:42.694 --> 06:45.030
Do you remember
what your body is doing, Larry?

06:47.908 --> 06:50.327
I can't tell you exactly.

06:52.704 --> 06:55.499
I only remember that it's something bad.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.836
Where women are being killed?

07:00.546 --> 07:01.672
Sometimes.

07:02.548 --> 07:03.549
Yeah.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.850
Do any of the women look like her?

07:16.854 --> 07:18.397
She in any of your dreams?

07:18.480 --> 07:20.023
I wanna go home now.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.608
Okay, is she, Larry?

07:27.030 --> 07:28.532
I wanna go home, Chris.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.076
Larry, just look at the photo here.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.454
-I wanna go home.
-Okay, but is she--

07:35.414 --> 07:37.207
-I wanna go home.
-Okay, I'll take you home.

07:37.291 --> 07:38.375
-I'll take you home.
-Okay.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.502
-Larry, it's okay.
-It's okay.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.462
Can I talk to you outside?

07:43.297 --> 07:44.506
It's okay. We're good.

07:49.595 --> 07:52.014
We got him in there
talking about his dreams.

07:52.097 --> 07:54.057
That's all they are.
We don't have anything.

07:54.141 --> 07:57.311
-Because you didn't let me get it.
-Larry talks big. That's it.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.730
He did the same thing with us
in the Reitler case.

07:59.813 --> 08:04.109
Well, if your high-end detective skills
can't be trusted, whose can, right?

08:04.610 --> 08:07.905
-Don't fucking talk to me like that.
-I agree. Your tone's not helping.

08:08.405 --> 08:11.742
Detective Miller,
I appreciate your passion here. I do.

08:12.326 --> 08:14.328
But we do have our guy
in the Reitler case.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.872
And it's as open and shut
as I've seen in ten years.

08:18.749 --> 08:21.960
Why not go back to Illinois,
build your case for the Roach girl,

08:22.044 --> 08:23.754
then come back to Indiana
where she was found

08:23.837 --> 08:25.005
and take another run at Hall?

08:25.797 --> 08:27.466
None of us would object to that.

08:31.303 --> 08:35.307
We'll respect your sandbox,
and you respect ours.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.831
Fuck your sandbox.

09:02.668 --> 09:03.794
I don't know.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.254
It was the way he said,

09:05.337 --> 09:08.090
"Come back to Indiana
where she was found."

09:09.091 --> 09:10.425
Made you think what?

09:10.926 --> 09:13.679
Made me think they could steal the case
right out from under me.

09:14.721 --> 09:15.973
-On what grounds?
-Thanks.

09:20.936 --> 09:23.564
Well, Jessica Roach was abducted
in Illinois.

09:23.647 --> 09:26.650
Probably killed there too.
That's inconclusive.

09:26.733 --> 09:30.279
She was found, though, in Perrysville,
Indiana, and that is conclusive.

09:30.863 --> 09:32.489
So, they can claim jurisdiction.

09:33.407 --> 09:34.449
Yeah.

09:36.493 --> 09:37.786
Except…

09:38.996 --> 09:41.498
No. You say it. Your moment.

09:41.582 --> 09:44.877
Our suspect crossed state lines to
kill her, so, you know…

09:44.960 --> 09:46.378
Federal.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.088
Yeah.

09:48.172 --> 09:51.008
Well, most US attorneys,
they don't try murder cases.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.302
When they do, they've been known
to get their asses handed to them.

09:53.385 --> 09:58.807
But Hulin just brought in
an assassin, Edmund Beaumont.

09:58.891 --> 10:01.059
He used to be state's.
Tried a ton of capital crimes.

10:01.143 --> 10:02.311
Hulin likes you?

10:03.562 --> 10:04.563
Seems to.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.735
Put a bug in her ear about Beaumont.

10:11.153 --> 10:14.406
If Hulin agrees to bring us in,
and she puts Beaumont on it…

10:15.490 --> 10:18.118
Brian, you got a shot at slamming the door
on this guy.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.457
Mark will lead the interview.

10:23.540 --> 10:27.336
If Hall throat-kills women,
I don't want Lauren in the room.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.046
Might spook him.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.173
I have a guy I'd like to use for the poly.

10:31.757 --> 10:32.966
Mark could do the poly.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.344
When are you cleared to part us?

10:35.427 --> 10:37.054
I'm in court all week.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.431
Then let's do the 15th?

10:39.932 --> 10:41.767
It's a lot of time for things to go wrong.

10:42.559 --> 10:47.022
Marion or Wabash could claim jurisdiction
at any time. Hall could get a lawyer.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.858
Jackrabbit, take off, kill again.

10:51.068 --> 10:54.029
You brought this to us.
This is how we're gonna do it.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.207
What are you smiling about?

11:09.169 --> 11:11.713
I think you already picked me for the job.

11:14.299 --> 11:15.300
Yeah?

11:15.384 --> 11:17.636
Yeah, I'm not sure
there ever was anybody else.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.806
I got black belts
in karate and tae kwon do,

11:20.889 --> 11:24.935
and I'm… charming.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.271
And you're so bashful about it.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.484
-You think it'll endear you to Hall?
-Possibly.

11:32.568 --> 11:34.695
Maybe he'll wanna hang out
with the cool guy.

11:53.839 --> 11:55.591
Here's your competition, Jimmy.

11:55.674 --> 11:56.925
Won a boxing championship

11:57.009 --> 11:59.303
while serving with the Rangers
during Desert Storm.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.513
So, I think he can handle himself.

12:01.597 --> 12:03.891
Personable, non-threatening demeanor,

12:03.974 --> 12:06.018
and he doesn't have an ego
that announces itself

12:06.101 --> 12:08.145
half an hour before he enters
a fucking room.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.147
-So, pick him.
-Beaumont wants to.

12:11.273 --> 12:14.109
You are full of yourself, and you are
full of shit. That's all he sees.

12:14.193 --> 12:17.154
-Yeah, that's all you tell him.
-'Cause that's pretty much all I see.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.822
Why'd your parents divorce?

12:22.492 --> 12:26.121
They had too much fire and passion,
but they loved us,

12:26.205 --> 12:27.873
-and they wondered what we--
-Bullshit.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.128
Look, I didn't get along
with my stepfather, okay,

12:33.212 --> 12:34.796
but I could care less if my parents were--

12:34.880 --> 12:35.881
Bullshit!

12:40.844 --> 12:43.055
Don't fucking waste my time.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.899
Are you-- You're leaving now?

12:58.028 --> 13:00.989
All right, come on.
My mother fucked around.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.120
I think.

13:11.542 --> 13:14.127
My old man was always drinking,
never home.

13:15.128 --> 13:18.215
And he might have been on the take,

13:18.298 --> 13:21.927
so it was like growing up
in an earthquake.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.064
We didn't have any choice in any of it.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.649
They just did what they did,

13:36.316 --> 13:39.486
and we had to… take it.

13:44.533 --> 13:46.785
That house was a fucking horror show.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.122
Must have been lonely.

13:51.039 --> 13:53.000
It was what it was.

14:01.967 --> 14:03.510
If you end up in with Hall,

14:04.636 --> 14:06.638
I want you to remember
who you were at eight.

14:07.723 --> 14:11.810
Tap into it. Feel it. Wear it like skin.

14:14.605 --> 14:15.981
I don't like that skin.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.026
Hall doesn't like his either.

14:32.164 --> 14:33.790
Where are you with the file?

14:35.501 --> 14:36.502
I…

14:37.461 --> 14:40.047
Yeah, I've been looking
at the Jessica Roach killing again,

14:40.130 --> 14:42.466
and I… I have a question.

14:45.886 --> 14:48.013
How'd she die? It's blacked out.

14:48.096 --> 14:49.598
She was strangled.

14:49.681 --> 14:50.682
But how?

14:50.766 --> 14:54.102
-He used his hands, or rope? What?
-You tell me if you talk to him.

14:55.354 --> 14:56.480
But you know.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.610
I know.

15:11.245 --> 15:13.247
Larry, thanks for coming down.

15:14.289 --> 15:15.958
-Hey.
-Brought along a colleague.

15:16.041 --> 15:18.919
This is Agent Ellenberg from the FBI.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.712
Glad to meet you, Mr. Hall.

15:20.796 --> 15:23.006
I'm Larry. Just call me Larry.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.758
Well, call me Mark.

15:25.300 --> 15:26.301
Mark.

15:26.385 --> 15:29.346
Do you need anything? Water? Soda?

15:30.430 --> 15:31.974
Water would be nice, yeah.

15:32.057 --> 15:35.269
Want a water? Yeah, let me get that.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.275
Wanna have a seat?

15:55.622 --> 15:57.374
What is this?

15:57.958 --> 15:59.042
Waiver of rights.

16:00.377 --> 16:03.505
It just says you're okay talking with me,

16:03.589 --> 16:05.090
answering a few questions.

16:05.174 --> 16:08.427
Do you mind if I look over it for a bit?

16:08.510 --> 16:09.678
Sure.

16:33.118 --> 16:36.371
This is consent for the polygraph.

16:36.455 --> 16:37.956
I can't take that.

16:39.875 --> 16:41.126
Why not?

16:42.002 --> 16:43.795
Because I don't believe I'll pass.

16:48.550 --> 16:50.093
Why do you think that?

16:54.598 --> 16:55.682
It would--

16:59.394 --> 17:01.396
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

17:04.942 --> 17:06.193
Could you just do--

17:06.276 --> 17:09.445
Would you mind leaving? I ju--
Your energy makes me feel itchy.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.325
Sure thing, Larry.

17:26.547 --> 17:29.591
You know, I am sorry.
I'm just so tired right now.

17:30.592 --> 17:32.010
I'm afraid to sleep.

17:32.427 --> 17:34.096
I have nightmares all the time,

17:34.179 --> 17:38.100
and I… and I get depressed, like, bad.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.602
Have you seen anyone about that?

17:41.103 --> 17:44.565
Yeah, I went to a counselor once, but it--

17:44.648 --> 17:45.858
He was young.

17:46.441 --> 17:48.151
And he wasn't very helpful.

17:48.235 --> 17:49.236
Yeah.

17:51.113 --> 17:55.492
Well, besides the nightmares,
what else depresses you?

17:56.785 --> 17:58.829
I'm very lonely.

18:00.205 --> 18:01.206
That's hard.

18:02.207 --> 18:04.626
Yeah, it is hard.
Like, I wake up alone.

18:04.710 --> 18:07.629
I go to work alone. I go to bed alone.

18:10.340 --> 18:13.385
Some other guys, they have women.

18:13.468 --> 18:17.097
They go to movies.
They eat pizza together.

18:17.598 --> 18:20.684
And you wish you had that?
A woman who loved you.

18:23.020 --> 18:24.062
Yes.

18:24.563 --> 18:27.608
But you don't feel that's possible?
You don't think women like you?

18:30.235 --> 18:32.404
No.

18:32.487 --> 18:33.655
So…

18:33.739 --> 18:38.202
What do you do with the urge…
to be with a woman?

18:40.245 --> 18:41.663
Always push it down.

18:42.164 --> 18:43.373
It's gotta be hard.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.878
And it's probably what causes
the nightmares.

18:47.961 --> 18:51.006
You know, you push it down,
it climbs right back up into your dreams.

18:51.089 --> 18:54.760
Yeah, that's why I do
such awful things in my nightmares, it--

18:54.843 --> 18:57.888
That's all that they are, though.
It's just dreams, you know.

19:03.894 --> 19:07.314
She wasn't in your dreams, Larry.
She was in your reality.

19:08.649 --> 19:12.236
I thought she was.

19:12.819 --> 19:13.820
No.

19:17.407 --> 19:18.867
Can I touch her?

19:21.578 --> 19:22.579
Sure.

19:30.879 --> 19:32.381
Tell me how you met her.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.512
She was riding her bike,

19:38.595 --> 19:42.015
and I drove up
and I stopped to talk to her.

19:42.683 --> 19:46.436
She was so very nice, you know.
Very nice at first.

19:46.979 --> 19:48.146
And then she wasn't?

19:48.230 --> 19:49.481
No, she was always nice.

19:49.565 --> 19:53.235
It's just that she got sad, real sad.

19:53.318 --> 19:54.695
Well, when was this?

19:55.487 --> 19:58.323
When she was sad, she was in m--

19:59.116 --> 20:00.784
When she was in my van.

20:02.995 --> 20:05.581
And then later in the field…

20:06.999 --> 20:08.709
The field in Georgetown?

20:08.792 --> 20:11.503
Yeah, it wa-- in Perrysville, Indiana.

20:12.963 --> 20:16.508
Right, do you remember where exactly?

20:16.592 --> 20:21.889
I do remember where it was exactly.
It was just past mile marker 16 on 1125.

20:21.972 --> 20:25.809
Normally, I wouldn't remember that.
I might not remember it, but…

20:27.227 --> 20:30.230
I didn't have time to bury her,

20:30.314 --> 20:33.859
so I had to drive past a few more times.

20:34.610 --> 20:37.946
Tried to find an opportunity,
but I never found it.

20:38.030 --> 20:39.531
It didn't happen.

20:39.615 --> 20:41.408
I mean, normally I bury all of them.

20:42.826 --> 20:43.827
Them?

20:45.454 --> 20:46.538
The girls.

20:47.706 --> 20:49.082
How many have there been?

20:50.667 --> 20:53.253
It's-- There-- It's a few.

20:53.337 --> 20:55.422
You know, I-- I'm--

20:56.215 --> 20:57.508
I just do things.

20:57.591 --> 21:01.553
I'm not in control.

21:04.765 --> 21:07.893
It's like that girl in Marion.
The college girl.

21:10.812 --> 21:12.356
Now, you know her name, Larry.

21:15.192 --> 21:16.693
Tricia Reitler, yes.

21:18.028 --> 21:20.822
You know, the Marion Police arrested
another man in that case.

21:20.906 --> 21:22.282
He didn't do it.

21:26.870 --> 21:29.998
There was one in Wisconsin,
near one of the reenactments,

21:30.999 --> 21:32.334
and some in Indiana.

21:32.417 --> 21:34.336
I can't remember which ones I hurt.

21:34.419 --> 21:37.840
It's just-- I'm so tired all the time.

21:37.923 --> 21:42.052
I'm always tired, you know, and sad.

21:47.432 --> 21:52.020
And what I don't like is
this guy in Marion

21:52.104 --> 21:53.522
trying to take credit for my act.

21:53.605 --> 21:55.858
He didn't fold the clothes.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.027
He didn't fold the clothes, did he?

21:59.528 --> 22:01.113
-No.
-No.

22:02.114 --> 22:06.577
Because he didn't break the zipper,
and he didn't feel bad about it.

22:06.660 --> 22:08.495
And that's why I folded the clothes.

22:15.919 --> 22:16.920
Yeah.

22:37.357 --> 22:40.736
I need a confession form and a computer.

22:43.655 --> 22:45.490
I'll set you up in the bullpen.

22:47.284 --> 22:49.953
What-- What's this about the clothes?

22:50.746 --> 22:54.291
Tricia Reitler's clothes were found
in a park about 10 miles from campus.

22:54.374 --> 22:56.376
That, and a bloody earring was
ripped from her ear,

22:56.460 --> 22:57.503
her blood was on her jeans,

22:57.586 --> 23:01.173
and her zipper was broken
where her jeans had been taken off of her.

23:01.256 --> 23:03.884
-She fought him.
-None of this is public information.

23:04.885 --> 23:06.803
-We need a warrant on his home.
-On it.

23:06.887 --> 23:08.180
And on his vehicles.

23:13.018 --> 23:14.895
You're a county sheriff's investigator.

23:15.562 --> 23:16.980
I'm Chief Investigator.

23:19.024 --> 23:21.109
And you just reeled in a serial killer.

23:23.028 --> 23:25.405
Well, we haven't done shit yet.
Let's close him.

23:25.489 --> 23:26.657
You're all set.

24:08.615 --> 24:10.701
-We got it?
-Yeah.

24:18.375 --> 24:20.252
He just asked
if he should contact a lawyer.

24:20.586 --> 24:21.753
Almost there.

24:21.837 --> 24:23.130
-Come on.
-Okay.

24:24.840 --> 24:26.300
-Gotta go.
-Yeah.

24:34.516 --> 24:35.726
Mark.

24:35.809 --> 24:37.477
Okay, I got it.

24:38.770 --> 24:40.355
-Go. Yeah.
-Print it?

24:43.483 --> 24:44.693
Fucking thing.

24:52.326 --> 24:54.745
This is what I did?

25:01.460 --> 25:04.171
I didn't do this.

25:05.589 --> 25:06.673
I didn't.

25:09.927 --> 25:11.595
Yeah, but you did, Larry.

25:16.767 --> 25:17.768
You did.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.786
No wonder why I can't sleep at night.

26:02.104 --> 26:04.606
Oh, God. Oh, God.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.442
Larry…

26:09.778 --> 26:11.071
it'll be all right.

26:15.909 --> 26:19.121
Nothing's ever gonna be all right again.

26:22.791 --> 26:24.918
Forget how I'm doing. How you doing?

26:25.586 --> 26:29.631
I'm, you know, whatever.

26:29.715 --> 26:31.675
I don't know, Dad. How are you?

26:36.972 --> 26:37.973
I'm weak.

26:38.056 --> 26:41.143
My left side is--

26:42.436 --> 26:46.732
I forget my keys, a lot.
You know, shit like that.

26:46.815 --> 26:48.567
What are you gonna do?

26:48.650 --> 26:50.110
It is what it is.

26:50.194 --> 26:51.445
Sammy taking care of you?

26:52.446 --> 26:53.447
Too much.

26:53.530 --> 26:57.034
I can't take a piss
without her asking me what color it is.

26:57.117 --> 27:00.537
I said, "It's yellow."
"Yeah, but dark or light?"

27:03.457 --> 27:04.541
Yeah, you.

27:06.460 --> 27:09.630
Well, good for her, you old prick.
Listen to her.

27:10.130 --> 27:11.757
Yeah, yeah.

27:11.840 --> 27:15.219
Seriously, how you doing in there?

27:15.302 --> 27:16.720
Jimmy, time's up.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.013
Dad, I gotta roll.

27:18.847 --> 27:19.848
Talk soon, okay?

27:19.932 --> 27:23.018
Yeah, sure. Stay safe.

27:23.101 --> 27:24.144
You too.

27:38.867 --> 27:39.868
What?

27:42.162 --> 27:43.163
What?

27:46.750 --> 27:47.751
You could've told him

27:47.835 --> 27:50.337
you went blind in one eye
for a couple of days last week.

27:50.420 --> 27:51.755
Who wants to hear that?

27:51.839 --> 27:55.425
Or you got trouble
walking or talking some days.

27:55.509 --> 27:57.761
-Just s-- You know, will you stop it?
-What?

27:57.845 --> 27:59.805
-Just stop!
-What?

27:59.888 --> 28:02.474
Just, you know--

28:02.558 --> 28:03.559
What?

28:04.101 --> 28:05.102
Stop.

28:08.021 --> 28:12.442
Me and my son, we have a shorthand.
We say things without having to say them.

28:12.526 --> 28:15.362
-You don't say anything at all.
-That's what I just said.

28:22.452 --> 28:23.829
Yeah, have some more wine.

28:24.621 --> 28:25.873
Take your purple pill.

28:46.143 --> 28:47.394
Hey, Jason!

28:50.772 --> 28:52.608
Thanks, we're moving on. Close it up.

28:53.108 --> 28:54.193
Seen these yet?

28:54.693 --> 28:56.612
As nasty as the house?

28:56.695 --> 28:57.905
One of 'em is.

29:00.699 --> 29:01.742
Uh-huh.

29:03.952 --> 29:05.204
What about the other one?

29:14.046 --> 29:18.175
First ERT guy said, to his expert nose,
it smells like three things.

29:18.258 --> 29:21.637
Chemical cleanser, Armor All,
and denatured alcohol.

29:22.596 --> 29:25.349
The one thing in the world
Larry Hall keeps clean.

29:26.141 --> 29:27.142
Right?

30:03.303 --> 30:04.555
So, no more dentist?

30:09.601 --> 30:10.978
Hall was a janitor.

30:11.061 --> 30:13.355
Worked nights
on the same three office buildings.

30:13.438 --> 30:16.817
Company said no janitor they ever had
cleaned half as good as Larry.

30:17.776 --> 30:20.654
That's why you never found
his victims' DNA in his van.

30:20.737 --> 30:24.491
Bingo. What's the other salient fact
that made Hall such a competent killer?

30:25.701 --> 30:27.119
He grew up digging graves?

30:28.453 --> 30:30.205
Starting to ace the quizzes now.

30:33.876 --> 30:34.960
What about his twin?

30:35.043 --> 30:36.044
Gary?

30:36.670 --> 30:38.881
You read about
fetofetal transfusion syndrome?

30:39.756 --> 30:41.300
Yeah, I didn't know what it meant.

30:41.383 --> 30:42.551
It happens in the womb

30:42.634 --> 30:46.430
when one twin imbibes
more of the placenta blood than the other.

30:47.014 --> 30:49.349
Essentially, Gary drank
crucial parts of Larry

30:49.433 --> 30:50.559
before they were born.

30:51.977 --> 30:53.437
Holy shit.

30:53.520 --> 30:57.065
So, Gary got the looks and the brains
and some athletic ability,

30:57.149 --> 31:00.819
and Larry got… being Larry.

31:01.820 --> 31:03.155
They get along?

31:03.238 --> 31:05.407
Gary is Larry's biggest defender.

31:07.075 --> 31:08.410
My brother's not well.

31:08.911 --> 31:11.079
He's weird as shit, but he's harmless.

31:12.372 --> 31:15.042
Gary, I'm gonna need you to take
two steps back.

31:21.048 --> 31:22.966
Your brother confessed to two murders.

31:24.885 --> 31:28.222
He's just-- He's so desperate,
you know? For attention.

31:28.305 --> 31:31.141
When we were kids,
he'd try out lies just to lie, all right?

31:31.225 --> 31:33.185
He lies just to get a reaction.

31:34.561 --> 31:36.688
He ever mix the truth in with those lies?

31:37.523 --> 31:38.857
See if anybody catches it?

31:39.441 --> 31:41.151
We're just regular people here. Okay?

31:41.235 --> 31:43.570
We don't kill people.
We don't know people who kill people.

31:44.279 --> 31:46.490
How'd you get him to tell that story
you wanted to hear?

31:46.990 --> 31:48.617
All I wanted to hear was the truth.

31:48.867 --> 31:52.371
All you wanted to do
was to close your fucking casebook.

31:53.038 --> 31:55.999
So you put an idea in his head because
you knew he'd say what you wanted him to,

31:56.083 --> 31:57.584
because he's impressionable.

31:58.085 --> 31:59.962
Well, that cuts both ways, motherfucker.

32:00.045 --> 32:01.547
I'm gonna check on my mother.

32:12.891 --> 32:16.353
If you can't tamp down your
natural alpha male qualities completely,

32:16.436 --> 32:20.399
and I doubt you can,
be a Gary to Larry Hall.

32:20.899 --> 32:22.651
Make him feel like you're his brother.

32:22.734 --> 32:25.654
Always looking out for him, never judging.

32:28.824 --> 32:29.825
All right.

32:32.077 --> 32:33.078
Well…

32:34.997 --> 32:36.498
We've got a plane to catch.

32:37.082 --> 32:38.083
What?

32:39.960 --> 32:41.920
Audition's over. You got the role.

32:44.339 --> 32:45.507
Jimmy.

32:46.091 --> 32:47.467
Now.

33:11.992 --> 33:13.702
-Hey, hey.
-Marshal, how you doing?

33:13.785 --> 33:15.120
Doing well.

33:16.955 --> 33:18.123
How you doing?

33:20.501 --> 33:21.793
Here.

33:22.878 --> 33:25.088
You gotta put them back on
when we get to Springfield,

33:25.172 --> 33:26.757
but until then, you good.

33:28.592 --> 33:30.594
You got mad testes, dog.

33:31.178 --> 33:32.971
Come on, you can change inside.

33:34.139 --> 33:35.140
Change?

33:51.990 --> 33:54.701
So you're in street clothes,
'cause you're not going in as a transfer.

33:54.785 --> 33:56.370
Only the warden and the chief shrink know

33:56.453 --> 33:58.455
you're anything other than
a scumbag arms dealer

33:58.539 --> 34:00.165
who got sentenced to Springfield time.

34:02.459 --> 34:03.502
You scared?

34:10.801 --> 34:12.010
I'll get over it.

34:13.762 --> 34:14.804
Don't.

34:15.889 --> 34:20.101
Comfortable people get cocky,
and cocky people fuck up.

34:21.478 --> 34:22.771
Prefer you didn't fuck up.

34:29.194 --> 34:32.155
This recent arrest
hopefully will put an end to the fears…

34:32.239 --> 34:34.157
Yeah, I'll get him to blab in the car.

34:35.993 --> 34:37.911
Well, it's a long drive, flat country.

34:37.995 --> 34:39.621
Who knows how many he'll cop to?

34:41.081 --> 34:42.708
'Cause they don't give a shit, Pat.

34:42.791 --> 34:45.127
They think they're dealing
with some harmless weirdo,

34:45.210 --> 34:47.420
who likes confessing to shit he didn't do.

34:49.715 --> 34:52.426
Yeah, I'll call you if I hear anything.

34:57.054 --> 35:01.018
We've apprehended a suspect in
the abduction and murder of Jessica Roach.

35:01.894 --> 35:04.563
But through the diligence
of the officers you see behind me…

35:06.106 --> 35:07.107
Fuck me.

35:07.191 --> 35:09.818
…we believe
Larry DeWayne Hall may be responsible

35:09.902 --> 35:12.779
for the deaths
of as many as four more young women.

35:12.863 --> 35:15.324
Are you saying
you captured a serial killer?

35:21.371 --> 35:25.083
No one likes Rob Roy
more than Braveheart. No one.

35:25.167 --> 35:28.378
-That's what I keep telling him.
-It is more historically accurate.

35:28.462 --> 35:29.796
Says who, Liam Neeson?

35:30.589 --> 35:33.300
Edward the Longshanks did not die
on the same day as William Wallace,

35:33.383 --> 35:35.052
and the Battle of Stirling
didn't take place--

35:35.135 --> 35:36.512
God, it doesn't matter.

35:36.595 --> 35:40.015
Yeah. One's a great movie,
the other stars Jessica Lange.

35:40.098 --> 35:42.559
Hey, Jim, I need you over here for a bit.

35:43.101 --> 35:44.394
Sure. Give me a minute.

35:44.978 --> 35:46.396
No minute. Come on.

35:54.571 --> 35:56.823
You wanna be out of prison yesterday,
right?

35:56.907 --> 36:00.160
And the feeling's only gotten worse
since we dangled this carrot, correct?

36:00.244 --> 36:03.455
Like a clock tick, tick, ticking away.
Right?

36:06.250 --> 36:07.835
Don't let the clock rule you.

36:07.918 --> 36:10.712
Don't approach Hall too early,
or he'll know we sent you for him.

36:11.547 --> 36:14.049
-I hear you.
-Besides the warden and Dr. Zicherman,

36:14.132 --> 36:15.592
I'm your only other safety line.

36:15.676 --> 36:17.803
When I visit you
treat me like your girlfriend.

36:18.512 --> 36:20.889
Slip me tongue, grab my ass, whatever.

36:21.390 --> 36:24.977
-Grab your ass?
-Yes. Cop a feel. Do what it takes.

36:30.524 --> 36:32.067
Should we practice now?

36:37.322 --> 36:41.493
Hey, cool guy, keep dicking around here.

36:41.577 --> 36:43.453
It's just your fucking life.

36:45.414 --> 36:47.958
If shit hits the fan,
you get to Zicherman or Warden Price,

36:48.041 --> 36:49.251
and have them call me ASAP.

36:49.334 --> 36:53.589
And, Jimmy, do not get any time
added to your sentence, understand?

36:55.257 --> 36:58.218
If you get time tacked to your sentence,
it supersedes our deal.

36:58.302 --> 37:00.053
It will be beyond our control.

37:00.137 --> 37:01.972
You'll be stuck doing Springfield time.

37:03.390 --> 37:04.975
What if I have to defend myself?

37:05.684 --> 37:06.894
Don't maim anyone.

37:06.977 --> 37:08.395
And don't get caught.

37:28.373 --> 37:29.374
Hey, Jim.

37:31.502 --> 37:32.753
Take care of yourself.

37:33.462 --> 37:35.088
I thought you were coming with us.

37:36.798 --> 37:38.342
I'll see you in a month or so.

38:26.932 --> 38:29.184
Yeah, I heard him making noise in there.

38:29.268 --> 38:30.269
Go and check him out.

38:51.331 --> 38:52.499
Going right.

38:59.339 --> 39:01.133
You two need any more pictures with him?

39:03.260 --> 39:04.595
I can hold the camera.

39:07.723 --> 39:08.974
Here we go, Larry.

39:15.105 --> 39:17.566
You really got nothing
to say to me, Larry?

39:21.945 --> 39:23.572
Never struck me as the quiet type.

39:23.655 --> 39:28.202
Seemed like the kinda guy who'd like
a good jaw session to start your day.

39:33.665 --> 39:36.877
My mom used to say
that I could just talk paint off a wall.

39:38.170 --> 39:40.380
That changed a little bit as I got older.

39:40.464 --> 39:44.801
Decided to appear
like the strong, silent type.

39:44.885 --> 39:46.220
Mostly to get laid, but--

39:47.638 --> 39:48.847
I do enjoy having a good chat--

39:48.931 --> 39:52.142
You know, I kept trying to tell you
that they were just dreams.

39:52.226 --> 39:54.436
I kept telling you, but you kept pushing.

39:55.312 --> 39:58.023
You forced a fake confession out of me.

39:58.649 --> 39:59.983
Is that how you see it?

40:02.277 --> 40:04.613
Who put that idea into your head, Larry?

40:04.696 --> 40:08.951
Now, why does everybody think I need
my ideas to come from someone else, huh?

40:10.202 --> 40:13.163
I'm smart. I've got ideas.

40:14.039 --> 40:15.415
I'll bet you do.

40:16.041 --> 40:18.043
I'd like to hear about a couple of 'em.

40:18.627 --> 40:20.546
Maybe ones that involve girls?

40:23.382 --> 40:24.925
Gary got me a lawyer.

40:26.218 --> 40:27.719
So it was Gary.

40:28.220 --> 40:29.847
Yeah, but-- No, but…

40:30.597 --> 40:33.559
The lawyer said that I wasn't to say
another word to you.

40:33.642 --> 40:34.643
Is that right?

40:35.602 --> 40:38.647
Well, I don't know if that lawyer
is looking out for you, in my opinion.

40:38.730 --> 40:41.233
'Cause you twist what I have to say.

40:41.316 --> 40:43.443
We didn't twist your words, Larry.

40:43.527 --> 40:45.404
You told us about your dreams.

40:46.738 --> 40:49.408
We documented it,
and you signed a confession.

40:49.491 --> 40:50.659
Which was coerced!

40:50.742 --> 40:51.785
No.

40:51.869 --> 40:53.203
The confession was coe--

40:55.914 --> 41:00.002
We are coming, Father Abraham
300,000 more

41:00.085 --> 41:01.461
Hey, Larry. Take it easy.

41:01.545 --> 41:02.838
From Mississippi's winding stream…

41:02.921 --> 41:04.006
Larry.

41:04.798 --> 41:08.927
We leave our plows and workshops
Our wives and children dear

41:09.011 --> 41:12.222
With hearts so full of utterance
With but a silent tear

41:12.306 --> 41:13.974
Hey. Take it easy, all right?

41:14.057 --> 41:17.769
We are coming, Father Abraham
300,000 more

41:17.853 --> 41:21.481
From Mississippi's winding stream
And from New England's shore

41:21.565 --> 41:22.733
Okay.

41:33.285 --> 41:34.453
You got kids?

41:35.704 --> 41:38.415
Yeah, I got a son. He's five.

41:39.541 --> 41:43.670
Man, loved five. It's the perfect age.

41:43.754 --> 41:45.214
They think you're a god.

41:45.297 --> 41:47.341
Yeah, but now, Brittany?

41:47.424 --> 41:50.511
Shit, she's nine, going on
"Fuck you, Daddy. You don't understand."

41:50.594 --> 41:53.263
Shit, I'll take that
over dirty diapers any day.

41:53.347 --> 41:55.557
Yeah. Bigger the kid, bigger the problem.

41:55.641 --> 41:58.018
Yeah, says the man
who hadn't wiped an ass in a while.

42:01.104 --> 42:02.481
What about you, you got kids?

42:03.774 --> 42:04.816
No.

42:06.485 --> 42:07.903
You got a wife?

42:09.363 --> 42:11.240
-No.
-Girlfriend?

42:14.952 --> 42:17.871
-Nothing serious.
-You a lucky man. Shit.

42:19.831 --> 42:21.250
Lucky man.

43:07.713 --> 43:11.300
Look, man, I can't. I can't do this.
Let's just go back.

43:11.800 --> 43:13.177
No, you can do it.

43:13.260 --> 43:15.220
-Come on, bro.
-Hey, you got this.

43:15.304 --> 43:17.222
What if Beaumont changes his mind, huh?

43:18.056 --> 43:19.057
Backs out?

43:19.141 --> 43:20.434
Then I'm stuck there.

43:20.934 --> 43:23.353
In five minutes
that shift change is gonna happen.

43:23.979 --> 43:26.315
And that's the only time that we have
to get you in there

43:26.398 --> 43:29.318
without setting off smoke signals
from one end of the complex to the other.

43:30.277 --> 43:31.987
The time to do this is now.

43:32.654 --> 43:33.655
I'm out.

43:33.739 --> 43:34.781
Fuck.

43:34.865 --> 43:36.033
That's not cool, man.

43:36.783 --> 43:38.619
That asshole
can never walk back out those doors.

43:38.702 --> 43:39.995
You're our way to guarantee that.

43:40.078 --> 43:41.205
Fucking look at me!

43:48.253 --> 43:50.172
Whatever you decide to do right now,

43:50.714 --> 43:52.216
Beaumont will never forget it.

43:52.299 --> 43:54.801
I will never forget it.

44:00.516 --> 44:01.600
Final answer?

44:20.285 --> 44:21.745
Fuck it. Let's do it.

44:22.454 --> 44:23.455
Yes!

44:23.539 --> 44:24.540
My man.

44:24.623 --> 44:26.333
That's a good call, Jimmy. Smart.

44:26.875 --> 44:30.921
I gotta treat you
like a scumbag again, man. Sorry.

44:35.926 --> 44:37.386
All right, let's go.

44:43.475 --> 44:45.060
How'd he strike you?

44:45.561 --> 44:48.480
He didn't fill me
with an overwhelming sense of confidence.

44:49.731 --> 44:53.235
Well, that will be moot in about an hour.

44:54.903 --> 44:58.073
At trial,
Mr. Hall's entire theory of defense

44:58.156 --> 45:00.117
boiled down to a simple proposition.

45:00.701 --> 45:04.413
Due to a personality disorder
that makes him susceptible to suggestion

45:04.496 --> 45:06.874
and pathologically eager to please,

45:06.957 --> 45:10.961
he confessed to a crime
that he did not commit.

45:12.462 --> 45:14.631
When Mr. Hall's attorney, Mr. DeArmond,

45:14.715 --> 45:17.634
attempted to call an expert witness
in the field of false confession,

45:18.135 --> 45:21.054
Judge Baker refused to permit
Dr. Ofshe's testimony.

45:21.889 --> 45:25.684
Since the verdict hinged on Mr. Hall's
state of mind during his confessions,

45:25.767 --> 45:30.022
Dr. Ofshe's testimony would've gone
to the heart of Mr. Hall's defense.

45:31.690 --> 45:34.359
Further,
several aspects of the confession,

45:35.110 --> 45:39.615
Mr. Hall signing his name in block letters
when he is perfectly capable of cursive,

45:39.698 --> 45:43.577
Mr. Hall signing a statement
over the name Larry DeWayne Daniels,

45:43.660 --> 45:46.997
give further credence to
a state of mind that was suggestible.

45:47.706 --> 45:51.710
Further, the interrogating officer
in his initial confession

45:51.793 --> 45:55.714
was described by fellow officers
as intimidating to Mr. Hall

45:55.797 --> 45:57.758
and resistant to his initial answers.

45:59.885 --> 46:01.929
Mr. Hall's appeal is hereby granted.

46:02.429 --> 46:04.389
Counsel, join me in chambers.

46:07.684 --> 46:10.395
-It's getting closer, Mom.
-Yeah.

46:15.400 --> 46:16.485
What's our clock?

46:16.568 --> 46:17.569
A month.

46:18.195 --> 46:20.739
And she's putting a hearing
for the second appeal on the docket.

46:20.822 --> 46:22.950
Oh, fuck off. Really?

46:23.033 --> 46:24.993
Keene's not moot anymore.

46:25.494 --> 46:28.372
-We need him to step way up.
-I told him to move slowly.

46:28.914 --> 46:30.374
If he blows the approach to Hall--

46:30.457 --> 46:32.292
Hall spooks. End of story.

46:32.376 --> 46:35.212
But if he moves too slowly,
Hall walks into the free world,

46:35.295 --> 46:38.549
buys himself another van
and a box of zip ties.

46:47.891 --> 46:48.892
Hey, Larry.

46:50.102 --> 46:52.521
We need you in the boiler room
as soon as you finish up.

47:16.712 --> 47:18.589
Looks like they forgot about you, man.

47:19.840 --> 47:20.966
Sorry about that.

47:24.011 --> 47:25.304
Welcome to Springfield.

47:38.734 --> 47:39.902
Empty your pockets.

47:50.162 --> 47:51.997
All right, clothes go in there, bud.

47:52.539 --> 47:53.582
Follow me.

48:08.180 --> 48:09.640
Cough.

48:12.226 --> 48:13.227
Spread 'em.

48:20.025 --> 48:21.193
Here you go.

48:21.735 --> 48:22.778
Follow me.

49:03.485 --> 49:04.653
Chow's in ten.

49:05.153 --> 49:06.488
Which way?

49:06.572 --> 49:09.283
Just follow the crazy train, bud.

49:09.366 --> 49:10.450
Hang in there.

49:10.534 --> 49:11.785
First week's the toughest.

49:45.444 --> 49:46.445
How's it coming?

49:49.239 --> 49:51.116
It's pretty fucked up.

49:52.034 --> 49:53.410
How long to fix?

49:55.954 --> 50:00.918
A machine is like a--
It's like a person, Mr. Burden.

50:02.127 --> 50:03.754
Hygiene matters.

50:04.588 --> 50:07.049
And this boiler,
it was neglected for years.

50:07.132 --> 50:10.469
That neglect has allowed
for filth to spread everywhere.

50:10.552 --> 50:16.350
Every crevice is infected,
every valve, every locknut.

50:18.519 --> 50:19.686
So, how long?

50:28.362 --> 50:30.155
Want me to bring you something
from the mess?

50:30.906 --> 50:33.242
Yeah, just a sandwich.

50:33.325 --> 50:34.409
Will do.

50:34.493 --> 50:35.494
Thank you.

51:29.548 --> 51:31.884
What you mean?
Get the fuck out the way, ese.

52:04.416 --> 52:05.417
Hey.

52:12.090 --> 52:13.800
How can you do homework like that?

52:14.551 --> 52:15.719
I just can.

52:15.802 --> 52:16.970
How?

52:17.054 --> 52:19.890
First time I get less than straight A's,
then it's an issue.

52:32.069 --> 52:33.070
Brian Miller.

52:33.153 --> 52:35.280
How do you feel about today? Good?

52:36.823 --> 52:38.867
Wouldn't be the word I'd use.

52:38.951 --> 52:41.995
I wanna take another look
at all the cases Hall's a suspect in,

52:42.079 --> 52:44.915
but take a particularly hard look
at Roach and Reitler.

52:44.998 --> 52:46.792
Second guess all my case work?

52:46.875 --> 52:48.919
No, I want you to work it with me.

52:54.299 --> 52:56.718
-It's a Hail Mary, but--
-It's a waste of time.

52:56.802 --> 52:58.929
You're such a fucking pussy.

52:59.012 --> 53:00.097
A what?

53:00.681 --> 53:01.723
Okay.

53:02.975 --> 53:04.059
Work it with me.

53:04.142 --> 53:05.894
Okay, good night, Lauren.

53:05.978 --> 53:07.771
No. Hey, hey.

53:07.855 --> 53:09.940
I have a guy inside with Hall.

53:10.023 --> 53:11.108
You what?

53:12.025 --> 53:13.402
A guy inside.

53:18.574 --> 53:19.575
A cop?

53:19.658 --> 53:21.493
No, a civilian.

53:24.538 --> 53:27.624
What you're doing isn't police work.
It's fucking desperation.

53:28.375 --> 53:29.418
Good night.

53:46.643 --> 53:52.357
Yeah, can you connect me
to prisoner 8611167, please?

53:52.441 --> 53:53.609
James Keene.

53:55.611 --> 53:57.362
What is that? Chocolate chip?

53:57.446 --> 53:58.572
It's pistachio.

54:00.032 --> 54:01.033
Jimmy!

54:04.286 --> 54:05.871
I don't understand.

54:06.413 --> 54:09.374
You have to have a record of him.
I just talked to him last night.

54:10.792 --> 54:13.712
Well, maybe you've got the spelling wrong.
It's K-E--

54:15.088 --> 54:17.382
Okay--

54:20.177 --> 54:22.346
Okay. Say he was transferred.

54:22.429 --> 54:23.805
Wouldn't you be--

54:24.431 --> 54:25.557
Wait a minute.

54:27.100 --> 54:29.144
I gotta go to court to get it?

54:37.528 --> 54:38.570
He's gone.

54:39.905 --> 54:41.114
What? Gone where?

54:43.408 --> 54:45.244
That's good. Lights out!

54:50.207 --> 54:51.750
All right, lockdown.

55:58.317 --> 55:59.359
Thanks, Larry.

56:00.110 --> 56:01.111
Yeah.

57:06.343 --> 57:07.594
Night, Larry.
