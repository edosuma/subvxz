WEBVTT

00:11.845 --> 00:14.512
This place is dark.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.314
It's basically Hell.

00:16.315 --> 00:18.115
It's destroying my marriage.

00:18.117 --> 00:20.185
He thinks I'm crazy.

00:20.187 --> 00:24.322
There's been something done
here that has made it bad.

00:24.324 --> 00:26.924
It was a haunted house.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.262
You're talking about
hundreds of dead people

00:30.264 --> 00:33.632
wandering around.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.534
Well over 100 people
did die in the building.

00:36.536 --> 00:40.872
These things could
kill your kids.

00:40.874 --> 00:44.475
"Get out of here,
we don't want you here."

00:44.477 --> 00:46.944
And I just felt fear.

00:46.946 --> 00:48.813
My name is Amy Allan.

00:48.815 --> 00:51.616
This is like Grand Central
Station for the dead.

00:51.618 --> 00:53.284
I see dead people.

00:53.286 --> 00:55.420
They have pain
that they suffered.

00:55.422 --> 00:57.422
I speak to dead people.

00:57.424 --> 00:58.757
She hates them.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.358
Hates them.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.961
And they speak to me.

01:02.963 --> 01:06.097
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

01:06.099 --> 01:09.501
It's a demon, it's Satan.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.169
I rely on my partner.

01:11.171 --> 01:12.704
I'm Steve DiSchiavi.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.906
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.241
What was the body count,
what happened?

01:16.243 --> 01:20.111
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:20.113 --> 01:21.246
I don't know if
it's a demon or not,

01:21.248 --> 01:22.981
but it sure as hell
looks like one.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.583
It's my job to reveal them.

01:24.585 --> 01:27.185
I feel like I'm crazy.

01:27.187 --> 01:28.920
But Steve and I never speak.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.322
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:31.324 --> 01:32.190
Until the very end.

01:32.192 --> 01:34.325
I don't want to show you this.

01:34.327 --> 01:36.795
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.930
I just don't want anything
to happen to my mother.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.264
Or time to get out.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.000
You have to get out.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:55.182 --> 01:57.415
I'm out here in
New London, Wisconsin.

01:57.417 --> 02:00.285
It's about an hour
outside of Green Bay.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.153
I got a call from
a mom named Charlotte.

02:02.155 --> 02:04.555
Now, she bought
a big old nursing home

02:04.557 --> 02:07.358
and moved in there
with her nine kids.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.362
The second they moved in,
activity went crazy.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.163
She sounds really scared.

02:12.165 --> 02:13.565
Says if Amy and I can't help,

02:13.567 --> 02:15.633
somebody's gonna
get seriously hurt.

02:20.173 --> 02:24.376
Before Amy arrives, I look
for any leading information.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.911
This property is massive.

02:26.913 --> 02:28.580
So it's important I take my time

02:28.582 --> 02:31.916
to cover any
photographs, paintings,

02:31.918 --> 02:35.119
or furniture that could
influence her findings.

02:35.121 --> 02:37.388
When I'm done, the
location will be ready

02:37.390 --> 02:38.856
for tonight's walk.

02:52.139 --> 02:57.542
I'm getting so many dead here.

02:57.544 --> 03:00.078
And it's extremely loud.

03:00.080 --> 03:05.683
They were just crowding
me and crowding my mind.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.819
Then I'm hearing evil.

03:07.821 --> 03:11.289
I'm nervous and I hear
these dead were led astray.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.630
Charlotte, when we
spoke on the phone,

03:19.632 --> 03:21.699
you didn't sound too good.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.701
I've got paranormal activity,

03:23.703 --> 03:26.437
something fierce going
through this building.

03:26.439 --> 03:30.708
It's destroying my life,
it's destroying my marriage.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.711
It's affecting all my kids.

03:32.713 --> 03:36.180
I don't know what to do
to get our lives back.

03:36.182 --> 03:37.448
I'm trying to wrap
my head around

03:37.450 --> 03:40.185
why you would move
into a nursing home.

03:40.187 --> 03:42.720
I saw it and fell
in love with it

03:42.722 --> 03:45.924
and it was perfect because
of how big it was

03:45.926 --> 03:48.126
and it would give us
the space that we needed

03:48.128 --> 03:49.260
for my large family.

03:49.262 --> 03:52.730
So who exactly lives
in the house here?

03:52.732 --> 03:56.401
There's myself,
my husband, Jason,

03:56.403 --> 03:59.804
my kids, six of 'em still
currently live at home.

03:59.806 --> 04:01.739
Okay, so there's six kids

04:01.741 --> 04:04.075
and you and your husband
currently living here now.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.543
And I'm struggling.

04:05.545 --> 04:07.011
I bet you are.

04:07.013 --> 04:08.612
Okay, Charlotte, do me a favor

04:08.614 --> 04:11.749
and give me a list of what
the hell's going on here.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.818
We feel watched.

04:13.820 --> 04:15.753
We hear voices.

04:15.755 --> 04:18.022
Objects get thrown.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.291
We see shadow figures.

04:20.293 --> 04:23.027
We've been physically touched.

04:23.029 --> 04:25.763
Our health is failing.

04:25.765 --> 04:29.100
The mood swings, the mood
swings are the worst.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.968
Who's being affected by that?

04:30.970 --> 04:32.703
Everybody in the house is.
Okay.

04:32.705 --> 04:38.042
But my husband Jason is
the absolute worst.

04:38.044 --> 04:40.979
He's like a light switch,
he's like,

04:40.981 --> 04:45.250
he refuses to do anything.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.652
He thinks I'm crazy.

04:47.654 --> 04:50.054
Do you think he would talk to me
about what's going on here?

04:50.056 --> 04:54.992
No. Jason is definitely
in denial over it.

04:54.994 --> 04:57.461
Any idea what's causing
all this activity?

04:57.463 --> 05:02.667
It was a haunted house
prior to us owning it.

05:02.669 --> 05:03.935
I have these pictures here.

05:03.937 --> 05:07.472
Let me see.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.610
This place was a mess.

05:12.612 --> 05:14.011
Is there anything
else you can think of

05:14.013 --> 05:15.913
that might help
my investigation?

05:15.915 --> 05:20.050
My oldest son, Chance,
him and his friends,

05:20.052 --> 05:22.487
they brought in a Ouija board

05:22.489 --> 05:25.623
and I know that some
things happened,

05:25.625 --> 05:28.426
'cause he ended up calling me,
crying, right after.

05:28.428 --> 05:29.961
At least you told me that.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.562
It's something Amy's definitely
gonna want to know about.

05:31.564 --> 05:32.697
Now that we're here, I mean,

05:32.699 --> 05:34.566
what do you hope
we can do for you?

05:34.568 --> 05:36.967
I love the building itself.

05:36.969 --> 05:40.571
I still have hope that,
you know, whatever's here

05:40.573 --> 05:42.707
can get fixed and be taken out.

05:42.709 --> 05:45.376
I wanted to give my
kids a better life.

05:45.378 --> 05:49.847
I have a lot of guilt because
I'm not protecting them

05:49.849 --> 05:53.651
the way that a mom should.

05:53.653 --> 05:55.786
It's not supposed
to be that way.

05:55.788 --> 05:57.855
I'm losing everything.

06:04.196 --> 06:08.532
I feel sick, sick,
sick, sick, sick.

06:08.534 --> 06:13.337
Like something is coming at
me, trying to push me back.

06:13.339 --> 06:16.740
"Get out of here, get out of
here, we don't want you here."

06:21.348 --> 06:24.616
There's too many dead people.

06:24.618 --> 06:29.587
There's been something done
here that has made it bad.

06:29.589 --> 06:34.292
Maybe some kind
of, like, seance.

06:36.829 --> 06:39.363
And this was fairly recent.

06:39.365 --> 06:43.434
It wasn't done with
the best of intentions,

06:43.436 --> 06:48.039
that's why there's so many
different types of dead people.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.041
This place is dark.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.909
It's not good, it's not good.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.783
Okay, Charlotte, so
what's going on in this room?

06:58.785 --> 07:01.986
I've heard the sound of,
you know, people running,

07:01.988 --> 07:05.923
you can hear it from down
here, on my upper floors.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.258
You have a lot of
kids living here.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.326
I mean, you sure it
wasn't one of them

07:08.328 --> 07:09.593
running around upstairs?

07:09.595 --> 07:11.529
I don't allow them
on my upper floors.

07:11.531 --> 07:13.064
You sure it wasn't
maybe a break in?

07:13.066 --> 07:14.265
Anything like that?

07:14.267 --> 07:16.067
No, 'cause we have
an alarm system

07:16.069 --> 07:17.869
and it wasn't triggered.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.470
All right, so anything else?

07:19.472 --> 07:21.939
We've had a lot of voices.

07:21.941 --> 07:22.941
What's it sound like to you?

07:22.943 --> 07:26.210
It sounds like
someone's talking to us.

07:26.212 --> 07:28.346
Both men and women.

07:28.348 --> 07:32.150
The women, they sound like
they're kinda younger.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.352
Does any of it seem
aggressive to you?

07:34.354 --> 07:35.286
No.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.354
I was petrified, though.

07:41.227 --> 07:43.027
So there's a woman here.

07:43.029 --> 07:45.763
She's got issues.

07:45.765 --> 07:48.900
She's a mess.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.168
She's, like, all
over the place, so,

07:51.170 --> 07:54.372
I think that they would have
a lot of experiences with her.

07:54.374 --> 07:57.308
I think people would
hear her crying

07:57.310 --> 08:01.579
and possibly seeing her running.

08:01.581 --> 08:04.982
I think they think it's
children, but it's her.

08:04.984 --> 08:07.952
She seems angry.

08:07.954 --> 08:11.122
Very angry.

08:11.124 --> 08:14.258
She doesn't know why she's here.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.260
She doesn't like it.

08:16.262 --> 08:17.862
And she wants out.

08:23.469 --> 08:25.470
Well, Charlotte, you said
this place was unfinished,

08:25.472 --> 08:26.603
you weren't kidding.

08:26.605 --> 08:29.073
And it's freezing up here.

08:29.075 --> 08:32.510
We've been unable to finish
it, you know, because

08:32.511 --> 08:34.010
all the stuff that's going on.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.479
Like what?

08:35.481 --> 08:39.616
I've had a lot of headaches,
nausea, fainting spells,

08:39.619 --> 08:41.019
vertigo really bad.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.221
Well, you seem pretty healthy.

08:43.222 --> 08:44.555
You sure it couldn't
be from the stress?

08:44.557 --> 08:46.290
I think it's the house.

08:46.292 --> 08:47.358
Doctors?

08:47.360 --> 08:48.625
I've been to the doctors.

08:48.627 --> 08:51.028
Okay, and they can't
figure out what's wrong?

08:51.030 --> 08:52.163
No.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.631
Okay, anything else?

08:53.633 --> 08:55.233
I've been touched.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.700
Okay, where have
you been touched?

08:56.702 --> 09:01.839
My arms, my face, my lower back,
I've had my hair pulled.

09:01.841 --> 09:03.841
Does it feel like
a hand, a human hand?

09:03.843 --> 09:05.243
I can't tell what it is.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.510
Are they aggressive?

09:06.512 --> 09:09.713
The hair pull,
it was more aggressive.

09:09.715 --> 09:10.915
Anything else?

09:10.917 --> 09:12.983
I've clearly seen
a shadow figure.

09:12.985 --> 09:14.318
Do they look human?

09:14.320 --> 09:15.453
Does it just look
like a blob or?

09:15.455 --> 09:17.621
They're usually a dark shadow.

09:17.623 --> 09:20.258
But you can still see
through most of it.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.525
All right, so how often

09:21.527 --> 09:22.460
are you seeing these
shadow figures?

09:22.462 --> 09:25.195
It's pretty often.

09:25.197 --> 09:28.332
You know, if I come up
here, I'll run across one.

09:28.334 --> 09:33.137
I've also seen a man in
one of the upper bedrooms.

09:33.139 --> 09:35.272
One second,
he looked like a man,

09:35.274 --> 09:39.343
and then he looked like
a monster, and I lost it.

09:39.345 --> 09:41.011
Describe how it looked
as a man.

09:41.013 --> 09:44.148
He was older, maybe 60s, 70s.

09:44.150 --> 09:47.151
He was white, he had some hair.

09:47.153 --> 09:48.552
Describe the monster
to me now.

09:48.554 --> 09:50.421
It was like a creature.

09:50.423 --> 09:53.824
It was awful.

09:53.826 --> 09:54.959
Pure evil.

10:00.032 --> 10:03.834
There's some dead guy
up in here.

10:03.836 --> 10:05.970
He's holding a clipboard.

10:05.972 --> 10:08.772
He's telling us to please leave.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.808
This is his space.

10:10.810 --> 10:12.376
Nobody's welcome here.

10:12.378 --> 10:15.779
Would the living have any
experiences with him here?

10:15.781 --> 10:17.048
Yeah.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.982
I think they would see him.

10:18.984 --> 10:20.184
What does he do?

10:20.186 --> 10:24.989
He makes them feel
really dizzy, nauseous,

10:24.991 --> 10:28.459
sudden, like, weird
aches and pains

10:28.461 --> 10:32.997
that are really bad.

10:32.999 --> 10:35.866
He's saying that people
have it all wrong.

10:35.868 --> 10:38.335
People have it all wrong.

10:38.337 --> 10:40.605
He says there's
something much worse here

10:40.607 --> 10:44.108
because this man is telling
me that it's basically Hell.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.745
I don't feel good.

11:17.275 --> 11:19.209
So, Hailey, I understand
that you used to live here

11:19.211 --> 11:20.677
and this was your room.

11:20.679 --> 11:21.612
Yep.

11:21.614 --> 11:23.080
I was talking with your mom,

11:23.082 --> 11:24.147
she thinks whatever's
here is pretty dangerous.

11:24.149 --> 11:26.082
Do you agree with that at all?

11:26.084 --> 11:28.819
Yeah, ever since
we moved in here,

11:28.821 --> 11:30.353
everything's just
been different.

11:30.355 --> 11:32.222
In what way?

11:32.224 --> 11:38.094
My dad, he's been really
horrible towards everyone.

11:38.096 --> 11:40.898
He seems upset and frustrated.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.233
What was the reason for
you moving out anyway?

11:43.235 --> 11:46.503
One night, I remember waking up

11:46.505 --> 11:48.705
and there's just
a dark shadow there.

11:48.707 --> 11:51.040
What'd the shadow
look like to you?

11:51.042 --> 11:54.511
Just a shadow figure of
a person, probably a male.

11:54.513 --> 11:58.448
Just stayed there
and then I started crying.

11:58.450 --> 12:01.050
Have you ever had any
experiences any place else?

12:01.052 --> 12:04.521
Yeah. I went to bed one
night at my old house

12:04.523 --> 12:07.657
and there was someone
walking across the bed

12:07.659 --> 12:09.793
right before I was
going to sleep.

12:09.795 --> 12:11.861
Okay. You got young brothers
and sisters here.

12:11.863 --> 12:13.196
You worried about them?

12:13.198 --> 12:15.132
Yeah.

12:15.134 --> 12:17.000
They're so young
and they shouldn't

12:17.002 --> 12:18.402
be exposed to that
kind of stuff.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.538
And they can't just
leave like you did.

12:21.540 --> 12:22.606
Yeah.

12:22.608 --> 12:25.409
They're stuck here.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.811
Are you uncomfortable being here
'cause you look uncomfortable.

12:27.813 --> 12:29.146
Yeah.

12:29.148 --> 12:30.814
Maybe we should
just sell the place.

12:30.816 --> 12:32.416
That'd be best.

12:38.957 --> 12:43.293
So, down here, this
is just all darkness

12:43.295 --> 12:49.633
with a ton of dead people
wandering around in it.

12:49.635 --> 12:51.368
The clipboard guy is telling me

12:51.370 --> 12:54.304
there's a devil who
controls everything.

12:54.306 --> 12:59.176
He's really, like, bad.

12:59.178 --> 13:03.446
I think people would see
a oddly-shaped black thing.

13:03.448 --> 13:05.515
To me, he's got goat legs.

13:05.517 --> 13:08.652
I'm sure he appears
differently to everybody.

13:08.654 --> 13:10.720
All I know is he's evil.

13:12.791 --> 13:17.995
There are so many of these
dead people in this darkness

13:17.997 --> 13:24.668
that are lost and if they
stumble onto a living person,

13:24.670 --> 13:28.605
they kind of latch on.

13:28.607 --> 13:33.476
Say you get an attachment like
that, you become their state.

13:33.478 --> 13:36.212
So if they killed themselves,

13:36.214 --> 13:38.949
you could potentially
end up doing that

13:38.951 --> 13:42.485
because you've become them.

13:42.487 --> 13:43.887
After talking to Hailey,

13:43.889 --> 13:46.890
I wanted to see what Charlotte's
other kids had to say.

13:46.892 --> 13:48.892
On the top floor and at
the end of the hallway,

13:48.894 --> 13:52.496
I see a shadow figure.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.432
It's that spine-tingling,

13:55.434 --> 13:58.101
raising of the hair on
the back of the neck --

13:58.103 --> 14:00.170
Okay.
Feeling.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.639
I was sitting on my bed
up on the second floor

14:02.641 --> 14:05.041
and a mirror just
flew off the wall.

14:05.043 --> 14:07.311
And then I just
instantly started crying.

14:07.313 --> 14:09.979
All of 'em are having
bad experiences.

14:09.981 --> 14:11.515
Well, I woke up one night

14:11.517 --> 14:14.451
and there were
scratches on my chest.

14:14.453 --> 14:16.853
I feel like I'm being
watched a lot of the time,

14:16.855 --> 14:19.122
like I'm surrounded.

14:19.124 --> 14:21.858
But the person who had
the most experiences

14:21.860 --> 14:23.460
wasn't even a family member.

14:23.462 --> 14:25.595
It was Charlotte's
best friend Nicole.

14:25.597 --> 14:27.397
So, what's been
going on with you?

14:27.399 --> 14:29.999
Well, I've heard what
sounds like an earthquake.

14:30.001 --> 14:32.469
You can feel
the whole building move.

14:32.471 --> 14:34.738
The whole house felt
like it was shaking.

14:34.740 --> 14:37.074
Is there a large amount of
trucks going through here?

14:37.076 --> 14:38.408
I've looked to
try to figure out.

14:38.410 --> 14:39.876
I've ran from one
side to the other

14:39.878 --> 14:41.745
trying to figure out what
could have caused it.

14:41.747 --> 14:43.880
I mean, any reports
of an earthquake that?

14:43.882 --> 14:44.814
None.
Nothing like that?

14:44.816 --> 14:47.150
No thunderstorms, no nothing.

14:47.152 --> 14:48.485
All right, anything else?

14:48.487 --> 14:50.019
I saw a little boy.

14:50.021 --> 14:51.154
An apparition
of a little boy?

14:51.156 --> 14:52.756
Yes.

14:52.758 --> 14:54.891
But then when I looked at
him, he just disappeared.

14:54.893 --> 14:57.226
I mean, I was still standing
there trying to process

14:57.228 --> 14:59.629
who this kid is and he was gone.

14:59.631 --> 15:01.231
I mean, do you think
whatever's here is dangerous?

15:01.233 --> 15:02.499
Yes.

15:02.501 --> 15:04.101
I mean, I'm worried
about Charlotte.

15:04.103 --> 15:05.569
I don't know how she's doing it.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.970
She says whatever's
going on in this house,

15:06.972 --> 15:09.772
she thinks is changing
people's personalities

15:09.774 --> 15:11.107
and their emotions.

15:11.109 --> 15:12.175
Ever notice that?
Yeah; yeah,

15:12.177 --> 15:13.776
I definitely have seen it.

15:13.778 --> 15:15.312
I think it affects all of them

15:15.314 --> 15:17.114
and I can see it bearing on her.

15:17.116 --> 15:22.252
She's scared and it's
consuming every ounce of her.

15:26.057 --> 15:30.794
I'm just in shock that
people actually even live here.

15:30.796 --> 15:33.463
This is bad,
it's not a good space.

15:36.468 --> 15:40.937
You're talking about hundreds
of dead people wandering around.

15:40.939 --> 15:45.475
These are like dead people
that this darkness collected

15:45.477 --> 15:47.810
for some reason or another.

15:47.812 --> 15:50.547
You know, like, when people
talk about purgatory,

15:50.549 --> 15:53.016
this place is like that.

15:55.688 --> 15:59.156
Just evil, bad, darkness.

15:59.158 --> 16:00.824
It can travel, I mean,

16:00.826 --> 16:04.961
it can go wherever
it wants, basically.

16:04.963 --> 16:06.296
This is insane.

16:25.550 --> 16:27.683
Charlotte says her house
used to be a nursing home.

16:27.685 --> 16:30.887
Now, clients get this kind
of stuff wrong all the time.

16:30.889 --> 16:34.156
So, I had a researcher double
check for me and it's true.

16:34.158 --> 16:35.891
I'm heading over to
meet the researcher now

16:35.893 --> 16:37.960
who says everyone who
owned the property

16:37.962 --> 16:46.235
had nothing but
the worst of luck.

16:46.237 --> 16:48.104
Well, Carrie, you
mentioned on the phone

16:48.106 --> 16:49.572
there's a long
history of bad luck

16:49.574 --> 16:51.541
associated with my
client's property.

16:51.543 --> 16:53.042
What was that all about?

16:53.044 --> 16:54.376
So it seemed like the property

16:54.378 --> 16:56.245
was really doomed
from the beginning.

16:56.247 --> 16:57.847
Originally, the plan was
to create

16:57.849 --> 17:00.183
a state-of-the-art hospital
for the New London area.

17:00.185 --> 17:03.119
They started
construction in 1931.

17:03.121 --> 17:04.587
Unfortunately, what happened was

17:04.589 --> 17:07.323
they ran out of money
and it just never opened.

17:07.325 --> 17:08.458
So what happens next?

17:08.460 --> 17:10.660
It sat empty for about 15 years.

17:10.662 --> 17:13.596
There was vagrants,
vandalism, squatters.

17:13.598 --> 17:15.832
The place really
fell into disrepair.

17:15.834 --> 17:17.465
Okay.
And it reached a point

17:17.468 --> 17:19.001
where even the newspapers
were reporting

17:19.002 --> 17:20.602
that people broke in because

17:20.604 --> 17:22.405
they heard rumors
that it was haunted.

17:22.406 --> 17:24.205
Okay, so even back then,

17:24.208 --> 17:26.208
they were saying this
place had spirit activity,

17:26.210 --> 17:27.476
so to speak.

17:27.478 --> 17:30.012
I know, eventually, it
becomes a nursing home.

17:30.014 --> 17:31.681
When does that happen?

17:31.683 --> 17:35.818
So, in 1947, Outagamie County
purchased the property

17:35.820 --> 17:39.889
and it did eventually
open in 1950.

17:39.891 --> 17:41.023
How's that go?

17:41.025 --> 17:42.424
They had poor living conditions

17:42.426 --> 17:45.094
and they had
patient abuse scandals

17:45.096 --> 17:48.096
as well as mismanagement
of the facility,

17:48.098 --> 17:52.168
and in June of '62, it was
actually shut down.

17:52.170 --> 17:54.437
So at that point, they
ended up selling it

17:54.439 --> 17:56.305
to a charity of nuns.

17:56.307 --> 18:02.444
By 1971, they had an inspection
and it was not up to code,

18:02.446 --> 18:04.313
so they ended up
selling the property

18:04.315 --> 18:06.381
about a month after
that inspection.

18:06.383 --> 18:08.718
That was the end of
the nursing home.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.254
Okay, so it looks like
for almost 21 years,

18:11.256 --> 18:13.055
it worked as a nursing home.

18:13.057 --> 18:14.657
I gotta assume during
that time period,

18:14.659 --> 18:16.325
a lot of people died
on the property.

18:16.327 --> 18:18.126
From my research
and what I found,

18:18.128 --> 18:20.929
well over 100 people
did die in the building.

18:20.931 --> 18:22.397
Realistically,
that's just the ones

18:22.399 --> 18:23.799
that we've been able
to find records for.

18:23.801 --> 18:24.933
So it could be a lot more.

18:24.935 --> 18:26.068
There could.

18:26.070 --> 18:28.270
Okay, so now the
nursing home's closed.

18:28.272 --> 18:29.472
Now what?

18:29.474 --> 18:32.074
The property sat empty
for a couple of years

18:32.076 --> 18:34.143
and then in 1974,

18:34.145 --> 18:36.678
it was converted into
an apartment complex.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.815
There were at least 15 more
deaths during that time.

18:39.817 --> 18:41.016
What are we
talking about here?

18:41.018 --> 18:42.551
They died of old age.

18:42.553 --> 18:44.821
All right, so it's obviously
not apartments anymore.

18:44.823 --> 18:46.355
When did that change?

18:46.357 --> 18:49.558
In 2008, the government
actually shut down the property

18:49.560 --> 18:50.960
for asbestos violations

18:50.962 --> 18:53.095
and it was actually
so dangerous

18:53.097 --> 18:54.630
that the owner was sentenced

18:54.632 --> 18:56.632
and went to prison for 18 months

18:56.634 --> 19:00.102
and it was foreclosed
on in 2009.

19:00.104 --> 19:01.570
So when you said this
place had bad luck,

19:01.572 --> 19:02.838
you weren't kidding.

19:06.511 --> 19:09.445
This darkness is taking
over the whole building.

19:09.447 --> 19:12.714
It was outside, it wasn't
in the building, at least,

19:12.716 --> 19:13.516
you know what I'm saying?

19:13.518 --> 19:14.984
But now it is.

19:14.986 --> 19:19.588
There have been
events, four events,

19:19.590 --> 19:26.529
and these events made
things with the dead worse

19:26.531 --> 19:33.536
and now that darkness is
larger because of these events.

19:33.538 --> 19:37.673
My God, okay, that's
just too much ****.

19:39.277 --> 19:42.278
No wonder Charlotte
and her family are freaked out.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.212
They're living in
a former nursing home

19:44.214 --> 19:45.948
where conditions were terrible

19:45.950 --> 19:48.351
and more than 100 people died.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.821
But I want to see if
there's anything else.

19:51.823 --> 19:53.155
Searching through old records,

19:53.157 --> 19:55.891
I come across
Dr. August Borchard.

19:55.893 --> 19:57.559
Turns out he owned the property

19:57.561 --> 19:59.562
before it became a nursing home.

19:59.564 --> 20:02.965
And he ran a medical
clinic there.

20:02.967 --> 20:05.501
You know, I need to find out
more about this Dr. Borchard

20:05.503 --> 20:07.636
so I'm heading over to
meet a local genealogist

20:07.638 --> 20:09.438
who's been doing
some digging for me.

20:09.440 --> 20:12.507
Now he says this guy's life
was filled with sickness,

20:12.509 --> 20:15.110
premature deaths,
and broken dreams.

20:21.118 --> 20:22.718
Well, Dave, it's good
to see you again.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.186
What were you able to
find out about him?

20:24.188 --> 20:25.988
Dr. Borchard became a doctor

20:25.990 --> 20:28.858
after working as
a schoolteacher for a while.

20:28.860 --> 20:31.393
Here's a picture of him.

20:31.395 --> 20:32.795
On the phone, you
said this doctor

20:32.797 --> 20:34.664
suffered through some
premature deaths.

20:34.666 --> 20:36.332
What'd you mean?

20:36.334 --> 20:39.334
Right, in 1901,
his four-year-old son, Edwin,

20:39.336 --> 20:43.205
passed away of an unknown cause
and that probably prompted him

20:43.207 --> 20:45.107
to go to medical school.

20:45.109 --> 20:48.144
Once he graduated in 1905,
shortly after that,

20:48.146 --> 20:50.212
he ended up buying the property

20:50.214 --> 20:53.215
that your client now
owns and they ended up

20:53.217 --> 20:55.818
living on that property
and then he established

20:55.820 --> 20:57.820
his business, his
medical practice,

20:57.822 --> 20:59.288
right on that property as well.

20:59.290 --> 21:01.623
So before my client's
space was even built,

21:01.625 --> 21:04.293
this guy was treating sick
people on the property?

21:04.295 --> 21:05.627
Yes, correct.

21:05.629 --> 21:07.696
Suffice it to say he's
seen his share of death.

21:07.698 --> 21:08.764
Absolutely.

21:08.766 --> 21:10.232
Later, in the early '30s,

21:10.234 --> 21:13.902
he wanted to build more of
a state-of-the-art hospital.

21:13.904 --> 21:15.638
So this guy built
my client's place?

21:16.908 --> 21:18.307
I know the hospital
never opened.

21:18.309 --> 21:19.641
Why is that?

21:19.643 --> 21:21.644
Dr. Borchard started
having health issues

21:21.646 --> 21:24.246
in the early '30s, he had
a heart attack in 1931

21:24.248 --> 21:26.915
plus the Great Depression
which was occurring at the time

21:26.917 --> 21:29.518
across the U.S. dried
up a lot of the funding,

21:29.520 --> 21:32.455
so that brought the whole
project to an end.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.857
His dream never
came to fruition?

21:34.859 --> 21:35.924
Right.

21:35.926 --> 21:37.392
Whatever happens to this guy?

21:37.394 --> 21:39.862
Well, unfortunately,
he suffers another

21:39.864 --> 21:43.599
heart attack in 1934
and that kills him.

21:43.601 --> 21:44.733
Here's his death certificate.

21:44.735 --> 21:46.802
If you notice on the bottom,

21:46.804 --> 21:50.139
the presiding physician, it's
actually his son, Melvin,

21:50.141 --> 21:51.540
who's there at the end for him.

21:51.542 --> 21:54.143
Okay, so now he dies in '62.

21:54.145 --> 21:54.877
'62, yeah.

21:54.879 --> 21:56.211
So we have this building

21:56.213 --> 21:58.547
that never opens
up as a hospital,

21:58.549 --> 22:01.083
he's dead, what happens
with the property?

22:01.085 --> 22:03.819
Well, Melvin kind of
abandoned the building

22:03.821 --> 22:07.956
until he finally sells it.

22:07.958 --> 22:10.426
I'm seeing
the clipboard guy again.

22:10.428 --> 22:11.960
Can you tell
anything about him

22:11.962 --> 22:13.295
when he was alive?

22:13.297 --> 22:14.497
He's young.

22:14.499 --> 22:20.502
He's probably in his
40s, very educated.

22:20.504 --> 22:26.242
I think that he had some
kind of, position here.

22:26.244 --> 22:29.044
He, like, ran the
place or something.

22:29.046 --> 22:30.112
Do you know how he died?

22:30.114 --> 22:32.781
This would be a heart attack.

22:35.453 --> 22:37.520
He takes care of things.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.722
He takes care of everybody.

22:39.724 --> 22:43.826
So I'm thinking he's moved
a lot of people up here

22:43.828 --> 22:45.661
to protect them.

22:45.663 --> 22:50.265
It seemed like he was
trying to protect everybody

22:50.267 --> 22:52.934
from the darkness.

22:55.606 --> 22:59.141
This is not good.

23:31.675 --> 23:33.608
So, another thing caught
my attention in research.

23:33.610 --> 23:36.078
A 19-year-old kid who lived
near Charlotte's house

23:36.080 --> 23:37.879
was found murdered in his car.

23:38.381 --> 23:40.915
Turns out he was the victim of
a love triangle.

23:40.917 --> 23:43.317
I managed to track down
his girlfriend's descendant

23:43.319 --> 23:46.053
and she says there was never
any justice in this case.

23:52.662 --> 23:54.862
Well, Linda, I appreciate
you coming out to meet me.

23:54.864 --> 23:56.664
I know you're related
to one of the people

23:56.666 --> 23:59.067
involved in
the deadly love triangle.

23:59.069 --> 24:00.401
Correct.
Okay, explain that to me.

24:00.403 --> 24:03.538
Well, my grand-aunt
was Esther Barcolt,

24:03.540 --> 24:06.073
the woman involved in
the middle of all this.

24:06.075 --> 24:07.408
So this was your great-aunt.

24:07.410 --> 24:09.077
Yes, my great-aunt.
All right.

24:09.079 --> 24:10.278
What do you know about her?

24:10.280 --> 24:12.213
She was quite
the character in her day.

24:12.215 --> 24:14.281
She was called a highstepper,

24:14.283 --> 24:17.685
which is a term for
a loose woman in the 1920s.

24:17.687 --> 24:19.954
Okay.
So take me through the murder.

24:19.956 --> 24:21.556
What were the circumstances?

24:21.558 --> 24:25.693
Well, on the 31st of July, 1930,

24:25.695 --> 24:28.295
the boyfriend of Esther Barcolt,
Henry Glocke,

24:28.297 --> 24:30.364
he was 19-years-old.
Okay.

24:30.366 --> 24:32.367
Was found dead in his car.

24:32.369 --> 24:34.368
When they found his body,
it was laid out

24:34.370 --> 24:35.770
on the front seat of the car.

24:35.772 --> 24:37.905
His arms were crossed over

24:37.907 --> 24:39.774
the bullet hole
through his heart.

24:39.776 --> 24:41.376
Now, there was a pistol

24:41.378 --> 24:43.978
but it was found on
the seat near his feet,

24:43.980 --> 24:46.381
which is pretty
far from his reach.

24:46.383 --> 24:48.850
So when the cops arrived,
what did they think?

24:48.852 --> 24:52.120
Well, at first, they
thought it was a suicide.

24:52.122 --> 24:54.522
Well, Ray Charles could
see it's not a suicide.

24:54.524 --> 24:56.858
But we know it was
determined to be a homicide.

24:56.860 --> 24:58.659
Right.
How did that all come about?

24:58.661 --> 25:00.928
So there was
a coroner's inquest held.

25:00.930 --> 25:03.464
Two different doctors testified

25:03.466 --> 25:07.335
that the victim's body was
in an unnatural position

25:07.337 --> 25:08.870
to have shot himself.

25:08.872 --> 25:12.207
So at that time, they
determined it was a murder.

25:12.209 --> 25:14.074
All right, so I see
Dr. Borchard testified.

25:14.076 --> 25:15.743
Now this is 1930, right?

25:15.745 --> 25:17.211
Correct.

25:17.213 --> 25:18.546
So at that time, he owned
my client's property.

25:18.548 --> 25:20.948
He was the first
doctor on the scene.

25:20.950 --> 25:22.349
Who would want to kill this kid?

25:22.351 --> 25:25.753
Well, there's the story
that the papers told

25:25.755 --> 25:29.357
and then there's the story
that my relatives tell.

25:29.359 --> 25:31.492
All right, so what's
the paper say?

25:31.494 --> 25:34.428
Papers reported that
Charles Barcolt,

25:34.430 --> 25:37.898
my grand-aunt's ex-husband,
wasn't a nice guy,

25:37.900 --> 25:40.734
he was...
He was abusive.

25:40.736 --> 25:45.172
He was demanding that Esther
take him back and see only him.

25:45.174 --> 25:48.576
So local people
thought that Charles

25:48.578 --> 25:52.446
had been the one to kill
Henry because he was jealous.

25:52.448 --> 25:53.981
Okay.

25:53.983 --> 25:55.383
You said that your family
has their own theories.

25:55.385 --> 25:57.719
My family says that Henry Glocke

25:57.721 --> 26:01.989
came into $500 on the day that
he was murdered

26:01.991 --> 26:04.192
and that he was murdered
because of money.

26:04.194 --> 26:05.927
$500 back then's
a lot of money.

26:05.929 --> 26:07.261
A lot of money.

26:07.263 --> 26:08.196
All right, so the papers try
to make it

26:08.198 --> 26:09.863
a juicy love triangle thing.

26:09.865 --> 26:10.998
Right.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.200
But you're telling
me your family thinks

26:12.202 --> 26:14.269
it was all about cash.
Yes.

26:14.271 --> 26:16.471
And the case has never
been solved to this day.

26:20.543 --> 26:22.677
My head, man.

26:22.679 --> 26:27.415
This is somebody that's
getting hit in the head.

26:27.417 --> 26:29.616
There's two men struggling.

26:29.618 --> 26:33.754
I think it's about
money or some ****.

26:33.756 --> 26:36.757
Like a teenager, I mean,
younger, I mean, you know.

26:36.759 --> 26:39.560
I mean, like 17 or something,
you know what I mean?

26:39.562 --> 26:42.363
It's hard to say
'cause it is dark.

26:42.365 --> 26:44.165
Somebody did somebody wrong.

26:44.167 --> 26:46.100
I'm hearing yelling.

26:46.102 --> 26:48.769
"You little piece of ****.

26:48.771 --> 26:50.037
I told you to do
the right thing

26:50.039 --> 26:53.040
and what'd you choose
to do, the wrong thing."

26:53.042 --> 26:56.377
He's trying to
make him eat rocks.

26:56.379 --> 26:58.779
And I feel sick.

26:58.781 --> 27:01.048
Really sick.

27:02.519 --> 27:04.251
This is not good.

27:13.262 --> 27:15.730
I saw a lot of disturbing
things on my walk

27:15.732 --> 27:17.698
but two stood out.

27:17.700 --> 27:20.668
First, the dead man
with the clipboard.

27:20.670 --> 27:25.273
He had a pretty basic haircut.

27:25.275 --> 27:29.877
I would say straight
from the '50s and '60s.

27:29.879 --> 27:32.346
He does wear glasses.

27:32.348 --> 27:37.418
Nothing really standing
out about his eyes.

27:37.420 --> 27:41.556
Next, I described the devil
I saw in the darkness.

27:41.558 --> 27:46.627
In front of me, was
a entity,

27:46.629 --> 27:49.030
it was pretty tall,

27:49.032 --> 27:51.799
and just make it
darker at the top.

27:59.575 --> 28:02.977
Amy, is this what you saw?

28:02.979 --> 28:05.179
Yes, that's what I saw.

28:33.409 --> 28:36.343
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

28:36.345 --> 28:38.678
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

28:38.680 --> 28:41.748
and our clients
for the first time.

28:41.750 --> 28:43.483
So, Amy, I want you
to meet Charlotte,

28:43.485 --> 28:47.821
this is her daughter Haley
and her best friend Nicole.

28:47.823 --> 28:49.289
Now, Charlotte
bought this building

28:49.291 --> 28:52.559
so she could keep her huge
family under one roof.

28:52.561 --> 28:56.629
Matter of fact, here's
a picture of everybody.

28:56.631 --> 28:59.165
Everyone's convinced that
whatever's here is dangerous

28:59.167 --> 29:00.366
and it's only a matter of time

29:00.368 --> 29:03.637
before somebody
gets seriously hurt.

29:03.639 --> 29:05.639
So now that Amy knows just
a little bit about you guys,

29:05.641 --> 29:12.646
I'm gonna ask her to
describe her walk.

29:12.648 --> 29:18.718
So, this location, it
was just ridiculous.

29:18.720 --> 29:20.453
I was freaking out because

29:20.455 --> 29:23.990
there's so many dead,
there's so much activity.

29:23.992 --> 29:28.328
For example, I saw one dead
woman who was freaking out.

29:28.330 --> 29:31.465
And she was crying
and wandering around and just

29:31.467 --> 29:32.866
screaming and yelling.

29:32.868 --> 29:34.935
Then, down the hall,
I was seeing

29:34.937 --> 29:37.938
a lot of drugs and needles.

29:37.940 --> 29:41.474
I was feeling
sickness, very dizzy.

29:41.476 --> 29:43.543
So something that came
across in my research

29:43.545 --> 29:45.212
that might make sense
of what you saw,

29:45.214 --> 29:46.613
you've probably
guessed this place

29:46.615 --> 29:48.348
wasn't built to be a house.

29:48.350 --> 29:49.549
Yeah.

29:49.551 --> 29:51.751
It was built, actually,
to be a hospital in 1931

29:51.753 --> 29:53.286
but it never opened.

29:53.288 --> 29:55.155
It sat empty for about 15 years

29:55.157 --> 29:58.692
and during that time,
vagrants, squatters, druggies

29:58.694 --> 30:01.160
had the run of
the place, basically.

30:01.162 --> 30:02.963
When they finally
cleaned the place up,

30:02.965 --> 30:05.631
it operated as a nursing
home for 21 years.

30:07.769 --> 30:10.570
After that, it closed
down as a nursing home

30:10.572 --> 30:13.372
and it become an apartment
complex for elderly people.

30:13.374 --> 30:15.242
Now, you said there's a lot
of dead people here, right?

30:15.244 --> 30:16.576
Yeah.

30:16.578 --> 30:17.777
Well, you can take
a look at this.

30:17.779 --> 30:20.446
This is a list of
about 115 people

30:20.448 --> 30:22.582
that died on the premises.

30:22.584 --> 30:24.117
Wow.

30:24.119 --> 30:26.720
But the expert I
spoke to said that

30:26.722 --> 30:28.655
this is the ones
they have records of.

30:28.657 --> 30:30.189
It may be a lot more.

30:30.191 --> 30:34.460
This is unreal.

30:34.462 --> 30:37.264
What else is going on?

30:37.266 --> 30:41.868
So, I'm up on the third floor,

30:41.870 --> 30:44.337
I encountered this male.

30:44.339 --> 30:48.808
He has a direct connection
to this location.

30:48.810 --> 30:54.681
And he was adamant
that this was his space

30:54.683 --> 30:56.549
and that I did not belong there.

30:56.551 --> 31:00.954
Something is coming at me,
trying to push me back.

31:00.956 --> 31:06.626
"Get out of here, get out of
here, we don't want you here."

31:06.628 --> 31:09.695
He'll make people feel
stressed, frightened, panicky.

31:09.697 --> 31:14.500
He can make living people
feel sick, dizzy, nauseous.

31:14.502 --> 31:16.970
I'm constantly sick.

31:16.972 --> 31:19.238
I get the dizzy spells.

31:19.240 --> 31:22.108
I get vertigo, I get
horrible headaches.

31:22.110 --> 31:28.381
He's physical enough that
you would probably see him.

31:28.383 --> 31:31.717
I saw a man in one of the rooms

31:31.719 --> 31:34.387
that scared
the bejeezus out of me.

31:34.389 --> 31:40.526
You know, I literally, I backed
out, I was a basket case.

31:40.528 --> 31:43.062
So, any idea of who
this guy might have been

31:43.064 --> 31:44.397
when he was alive?

31:44.399 --> 31:48.735
He had a clipboard in
his hand the entire time

31:48.737 --> 31:52.138
so I'm pretty certain he
worked there at some point.

31:52.140 --> 31:54.474
He seemed to be in charge.

31:54.476 --> 32:00.946
To me, he presented as
a 40-something year old man,

32:00.948 --> 32:03.950
very educated, and he told me
he takes care of this place,

32:03.952 --> 32:06.953
that he takes care
of everything.

32:06.955 --> 32:09.755
He said people
have it all wrong.

32:09.757 --> 32:12.358
There is something
much worse here.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.494
A lot of things you
said remind me of

32:14.496 --> 32:15.828
the guy who built this place.

32:15.830 --> 32:17.797
His name was
Dr. August Borchard.

32:17.799 --> 32:19.966
He bought this
property back in 1906

32:19.968 --> 32:21.901
and lived here with
his wife and kids.

32:21.903 --> 32:23.837
He also ran his original
medical practice

32:23.839 --> 32:25.171
here on the property.

32:25.173 --> 32:26.572
So if you were sick,
dying, or dead in the town,

32:26.574 --> 32:28.508
this guy was gonna
see you at some point.

32:28.510 --> 32:29.776
That's interesting.

32:29.778 --> 32:31.310
Now, he took responsibility

32:31.312 --> 32:33.713
of protecting the people of
New London very seriously

32:33.715 --> 32:34.914
from what I was told.

32:34.916 --> 32:36.983
And his dream, from
what the expert told me,

32:36.985 --> 32:39.185
was to build a hospital
for the community.

32:39.187 --> 32:40.720
He spent years raising the money

32:40.722 --> 32:43.856
and finally started
building this place in 1931.

32:43.858 --> 32:45.858
This guy had nothing
but bad luck though.

32:45.860 --> 32:47.727
I mean, first he
had a heart attack

32:47.729 --> 32:49.863
right after
the construction started.

32:49.865 --> 32:52.398
But he kept plugging away
and the place was

32:52.400 --> 32:54.868
practically ready to go,
it was 90% done,

32:54.870 --> 32:57.536
but at the last second,
the funding dried up.

32:57.538 --> 32:59.005
Right after the money ran out,

32:59.007 --> 33:02.075
he had a second heart
attack and that killed him.

33:02.077 --> 33:05.277
Now, I managed to track
down a photo of the guy.

33:05.279 --> 33:07.613
Does he look familiar
to you at all?

33:07.615 --> 33:09.148
I don't know.

33:09.150 --> 33:12.685
I had a sketch done of
the person that I saw.

33:19.027 --> 33:20.627
You're not sure?

33:20.629 --> 33:23.563
Are you kidding me?

33:23.565 --> 33:28.167
You tell me if
that's him or not.

33:36.644 --> 33:38.311
It's definitely him.

33:38.313 --> 33:40.446
Yeah, like, as soon
as you grabbed it out,

33:40.448 --> 33:43.717
I was like,
my gosh, that's the guy.

33:43.719 --> 33:46.853
Now, there's
a reason why he told me

33:46.855 --> 33:48.855
there's something
much worse here.

33:48.857 --> 33:52.392
When I made it down
to the basement area,

33:52.394 --> 33:57.196
I was, like, put
into the darkness.

33:57.198 --> 33:58.931
This vacant place.

33:58.933 --> 34:01.934
It's vast and in this darkness,

34:01.936 --> 34:04.670
is hundreds of people
from all over the world.

34:04.672 --> 34:07.140
When I was trying to get more
information on this darkness,

34:07.142 --> 34:12.011
the clipboard guy was
referring to it as Hell.

34:12.013 --> 34:18.083
But I was raised Catholic,
so I equate it with purgatory.

34:18.085 --> 34:20.018
This darkness has always been,

34:20.021 --> 34:24.556
but it was not always
part of this building.

34:24.559 --> 34:28.293
It was outside of the building
for a long time.

34:28.295 --> 34:34.367
But then I was told
by the doctor that

34:34.369 --> 34:36.835
there were several
events that took place

34:36.838 --> 34:40.639
and these events are what
moved the darkness inside

34:40.641 --> 34:44.043
and the most recent one was
within the last 20 years,

34:44.045 --> 34:49.982
there being some kind of
seance or conjuring done.

34:49.984 --> 34:52.918
It was not done with
the right intentions

34:52.920 --> 34:55.789
and so the darkness spread.

34:55.791 --> 34:57.990
And that's not a good thing.

34:57.992 --> 35:01.795
Well, my son played
with a Ouija board.

35:01.797 --> 35:05.665
Him and his friends all
went up to the top floor.

35:05.667 --> 35:09.202
There was a massive boom
that had taken place

35:09.204 --> 35:11.537
and they scattered.

35:11.539 --> 35:13.473
And he actually
called me, crying.

35:13.475 --> 35:14.941
That's not the only thing.

35:14.943 --> 35:17.210
The people who owned this
building before Charlotte,

35:17.212 --> 35:19.679
they were doing haunted
tours through there.

35:19.681 --> 35:21.080
What?

35:21.082 --> 35:24.350
Yeah.

35:24.352 --> 35:26.819
When I was talking to the
expert about this place,

35:26.821 --> 35:28.354
as far back as the '40s,

35:28.356 --> 35:31.490
people would come to see if
the place was haunted or not.

35:31.492 --> 35:34.627
Now, what's really concerning
about this darkness is

35:34.629 --> 35:37.497
you have all of these
random dead people

35:37.499 --> 35:41.033
wandering through your
space all the time.

35:41.035 --> 35:44.103
You could hear things
like people shuffling,

35:44.105 --> 35:48.241
walking, running, talking,
laughing, crying, screaming,

35:48.243 --> 35:52.311
yelling, possibly seeing
various apparitions of people.

35:52.313 --> 35:55.248
I saw a little boy
standing in the doorway.

35:55.250 --> 35:57.716
By the time it took me to
process, you know, he was gone.

35:58.987 --> 36:01.053
Now, I talked to four
of Charlotte's kids

36:01.055 --> 36:03.856
and all of them are hearing
noises, seeing shadows,

36:03.858 --> 36:05.992
apparitions.
Makes sense.

36:05.994 --> 36:09.996
The biggest way that these
dead affect the living

36:09.998 --> 36:12.732
is emotionally.

36:12.734 --> 36:15.401
They can latch onto you.

36:15.403 --> 36:16.803
So you would feel things like

36:16.805 --> 36:20.473
despair, depression, isolation,
regret, guilt, anger,

36:20.475 --> 36:23.943
and when they latch
onto living people,

36:23.945 --> 36:25.411
they mesh with you.

36:25.413 --> 36:30.282
You are taking on that
emotional state of that person.

36:30.284 --> 36:32.685
So one of the biggest reasons
Charlotte called us in is

36:32.687 --> 36:35.288
her and her family are
dealing with emotional changes

36:35.290 --> 36:39.292
in the building that are just
driving wedges between them.

36:39.294 --> 36:40.893
Talk about your husband.

36:40.895 --> 36:46.699
He is secluded, just
aggressive, and negative.

36:46.701 --> 36:48.201
And I wanted to talk
to him, obviously,

36:48.203 --> 36:49.969
but he wanted nothing to
do with this investigation.

36:49.971 --> 36:50.903
Really?
At all.

36:50.905 --> 36:54.640
Yeah.
Really?

36:54.642 --> 36:56.109
So the dead and the darkness

36:56.111 --> 36:57.577
are causing all this crap.

36:57.579 --> 37:00.179
What do they want from
Charlotte and her family?

37:00.181 --> 37:02.581
They don't really understand
what they're doing or

37:02.583 --> 37:04.984
they're just wandering,
they're lost.

37:04.986 --> 37:09.656
But they're being controlled
by this evil presence.

37:09.658 --> 37:13.459
I would call it a devil.

37:13.461 --> 37:20.332
So, it's much stronger than
what people consider demons.

37:20.334 --> 37:23.069
So I had a sketch
done of what I saw.

37:35.417 --> 37:40.019
I don't think you're
gonna like seeing this.

37:40.021 --> 37:41.220
No.

37:41.222 --> 37:42.688
I don't like it.

37:42.690 --> 37:44.090
I don't
like it.

37:48.496 --> 37:52.465
I'm afraid to leave her.

37:52.467 --> 37:54.834
What are those things?

37:54.836 --> 37:58.438
These are souls
that went to Hell

37:58.440 --> 38:03.109
and he has a couple of them
that he keeps with him.

38:03.111 --> 38:06.179
I want to make this
perfectly clear.

38:06.181 --> 38:11.250
You have a very
serious situation here.

38:11.252 --> 38:19.125
You have young children who
are directly in harm's way.

38:20.928 --> 38:24.997
These things could
kill your kids.

38:28.470 --> 38:30.336
I'm scared for her.
Yeah.

38:30.338 --> 38:31.337
I'm scared for the kids.

38:31.339 --> 38:33.872
Yeah.

38:33.874 --> 38:36.475
What are you gonna do?

38:38.013 --> 38:41.947
What can you do?

38:41.949 --> 38:43.348
I felt it.

38:43.350 --> 38:50.155
I just hoped that
it wasn't true.

38:50.157 --> 38:52.225
I've worked so hard.

38:56.297 --> 38:58.498
And for nothing.

39:16.750 --> 39:18.283
So, Charlotte, the other day

39:18.285 --> 39:20.485
you told me you felt like
you were living in Hell.

39:20.487 --> 39:22.688
And, unfortunately
for you and your kids,

39:22.690 --> 39:25.224
it sounds like you are.

39:25.226 --> 39:27.759
Now we're gonna find out if
there's any way to fix this mess

39:27.761 --> 39:28.894
so you can get on with your life

39:28.896 --> 39:31.029
and get your family
back together.

39:31.031 --> 39:36.701
For that answer, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:36.703 --> 39:45.043
This situation, it's beyond,
like, mere mortal intervention.

39:45.045 --> 39:50.782
There's nothing that
can be done about it.

39:50.784 --> 39:59.725
Right now, honestly, the safest
option is to move.

39:59.727 --> 40:02.861
As fast as you can.

40:02.863 --> 40:05.597
- We gotta move out.
- Nowhere to go, I mean.

40:05.599 --> 40:09.801
How can I find something
big enough, how?

40:09.803 --> 40:13.405
I totally wasn't
prepared for this.

40:13.407 --> 40:14.540
It's not easy to tell people

40:14.542 --> 40:18.210
they've gotta leave
their home, trust me.

40:18.212 --> 40:21.813
After you move out,
that's when an exorcism

40:21.815 --> 40:27.886
would have to be done on your
husband in a place of worship.

40:27.888 --> 40:34.159
What happens if, you know,
Jason refuses to get any

40:34.161 --> 40:35.627
help for himself?

40:35.629 --> 40:41.500
If he's to the point
where I think he might be,

40:41.502 --> 40:45.771
you might have to leave him.

40:45.773 --> 40:49.975
I know you didn't want to
hear it but, unfortunately,

40:49.977 --> 40:52.177
it's bad news.

40:52.179 --> 40:54.246
It, like, breaks my heart.

40:54.248 --> 40:56.114
But thank God they came
because if something

40:56.116 --> 40:59.251
would have happened
to one of the kids.

40:59.253 --> 41:05.390
It's not worth having
everyone get hurt.

41:05.392 --> 41:07.125
So I'll ask you simply.

41:07.127 --> 41:10.729
Are you gonna do what
Amy tells you to do?

41:10.731 --> 41:12.330
Yeah, I have no choice.

41:12.332 --> 41:16.601
I mean, I care more about my
family than a damn property.

41:18.873 --> 41:21.406
So I know this is bad news,

41:21.408 --> 41:23.408
but are you glad we
came to investigate

41:23.410 --> 41:26.077
or are you like I
shoulda never did this?

41:26.079 --> 41:28.280
I needed you to come out.

41:28.282 --> 41:29.681
I've been stuck.

41:29.683 --> 41:33.618
I've been stuck for,
God, years, already.

41:33.620 --> 41:36.487
And I'm sure Nicole'll help
you, whatever you need.

41:36.489 --> 41:39.023
Yeah, because I believe in her

41:39.025 --> 41:41.360
and I believe that she's strong.

41:41.362 --> 41:45.030
I'll figure it out, I
always do figure it out.

41:45.032 --> 41:46.965
I'm so glad we did this.

41:46.967 --> 41:48.833
Now we can actually move out

41:48.835 --> 41:52.103
and not have all these
horrible things happen.

41:52.105 --> 41:55.907
It'll be a good thing.

41:55.909 --> 41:58.844
Telling clients they
need to move isn't easy

41:58.846 --> 42:01.780
especially when
they have children.

42:01.782 --> 42:03.515
But if Charlotte
follows my advice

42:03.517 --> 42:06.118
and moves as far
away as possible,

42:06.120 --> 42:13.458
she and her family can find
the peace they deserve.

42:13.460 --> 42:16.394
Hi, it's Charlotte and I
have my daughter Haley--

42:16.396 --> 42:17.862
Hi.
With me.

42:17.864 --> 42:20.598
Since you've been gone, we've
been looking for a place.

42:20.600 --> 42:23.668
We haven't found anything
large enough for our family yet

42:23.670 --> 42:25.937
so hopefully in the near future,

42:25.939 --> 42:28.907
some properties will
come on the market.
