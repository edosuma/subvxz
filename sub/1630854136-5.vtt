Based on the facts,
it's clear that

and private conversation.

21:32.465 --> 21:33.770

the jury understand

Nichols in the first place.

I've been working on.

he's motioning to a waiter
for a refill.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.709
- Play it one more time.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.407
- If the waiter
was close enough to pour,

22:01.450 --> 22:03.452
they would have been
close enough to hear

what did you hear

22:40.620 --> 22:42.970

about Justice Sanders,

22:45.668 --> 22:48.715
and he used an offensive word.

22:48.758 --> 22:50.369
- What word?

- It starts with F,
and it refers to gay people.

Do I have to say it?

22:56.723 --> 23:00.030

what you heard?

23:02.990 --> 23:05.514
- Yes, I told one
of the student coordinators,

James Pell.

23:08.865 --> 23:11.085

for telling him this.

30:29.436 --> 30:32.221
- Pell started out by asking me
for a few thousand dollars.

30:32.265 --> 30:34.310
Then he wanted me to make sure
he was named

30:34.354 --> 30:36.095
editor-in-chief
of the "Law Review."

30:36.138 --> 30:38.837
- He was using your reputation
and influence

30:38.880 --> 30:40.795
to bolster his own résumé.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.231
- Yes.

30:42.275 --> 30:44.059
And I succumbed to his demands.

30:44.103 --> 30:45.582
- Why is that?

30:45.626 --> 30:48.672
- Because I'm ashamed
of what I said, deeply.

30:48.716 --> 30:50.849
It's not who I am.

30:50.892 --> 30:52.198
If I'd heard another man
say that,

30:52.241 --> 30:54.678
I'd be the first person
to speak up,

30:54.722 --> 30:57.464

of the tape

31:07.953 --> 31:10.390
Tell us why
you were so terrified?

31:10.433 --> 31:12.348
- Because we live
in a society where people--

31:12.392 --> 31:16.048

public figures

31:16.091 --> 31:18.702
