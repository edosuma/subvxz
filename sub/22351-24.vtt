00:02.540 --> 00:05.989
Previously on Big Brother,

00:05.990 --> 00:08.989
with Shelly and Vanessa on

00:08.990 --> 00:09.990
the block, Julie surprised

00:09.990 --> 00:10.990
the house.

00:10.991 --> 00:12.539
Julie: It is double

00:12.540 --> 00:13.290
eviction night.

00:13.290 --> 00:13.990
Here we go.

00:13.991 --> 00:16.989
And the Georgia peach

00:16.990 --> 00:18.989
became the first casualty of

00:18.990 --> 00:19.990
the night.

00:19.991 --> 00:21.989
Shelli, you are evicted

00:21.990 --> 00:24.999
from the Big Brother house.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.989
With power back on the

00:26.990 --> 00:28.989
line, Steve won his first

00:28.990 --> 00:30.999
head of household of the

00:31.000 --> 00:31.990
summer.

00:31.990 --> 00:32.990
Julie: You are the new

00:32.990 --> 00:33.990
head of household!

00:33.990 --> 00:34.990
And quickly made some

00:34.990 --> 00:35.990
surprising nominations.

00:35.991 --> 00:38.989
Meg and Jackie, I'm

00:38.990 --> 00:39.990
sorry.

00:39.990 --> 00:40.990
The veto competition was

00:40.991 --> 00:45.289
a slippery slope.

00:45.290 --> 00:46.999
And Johnnie mack snowed his

00:47.000 --> 00:48.949
opponents.

00:48.950 --> 00:48.990
Julie: Congratulations,

00:48.991 --> 00:50.989
John, you have won the power

00:50.990 --> 00:51.990
of veto.

00:51.991 --> 00:53.989
At the veto meeting...

00:53.990 --> 00:54.990
Julie: You may remove one

00:54.991 --> 00:57.989
of the nominees from the

00:57.990 --> 00:58.990
chopping block or you may

00:58.991 --> 01:00.949
leave the nominations in

01:00.950 --> 01:00.990
place.

01:00.991 --> 01:02.989
The dentist left Jackie

01:02.990 --> 01:03.990
and Meg feeling numb.

01:03.990 --> 01:04.990
I'm not going to use it

01:04.991 --> 01:06.989
on anyone, sorry.

01:06.990 --> 01:09.989
Wanting answers, Jackie

01:09.990 --> 01:11.989
confronted Steve and he

01:11.990 --> 01:13.699
explained his motivations.

01:13.700 --> 01:14.989
When you were head of

01:14.990 --> 01:15.990
household with Vanessa, a

01:15.991 --> 01:17.989
lot of people were telling

01:17.990 --> 01:17.991
me that you going to back

01:17.991 --> 01:18.990
door me that week.

01:18.991 --> 01:20.989
At the second eviction of

01:20.990 --> 01:22.539
the night...

01:22.540 --> 01:22.990
Julie: Jackie, you are

01:22.991 --> 01:24.989
evicted from the Big Brother

01:24.990 --> 01:25.700
house.

01:25.701 --> 01:26.989
She was banished from the

01:26.990 --> 01:27.990
Big Brother kingdom.

01:27.991 --> 01:29.989
Tonight see Steve's reign of

01:29.990 --> 01:34.989
power.

01:34.990 --> 01:35.990
Muss a new head of household

01:35.991 --> 01:37.989
will be crowned and two new

01:37.990 --> 01:39.949
house guests will go on the

01:39.950 --> 01:40.410
block.

01:40.411 --> 01:43.989
All this right now on "big

01:43.990 --> 01:46.990
brother"

02:27.950 --> 02:29.031
thank you guys so much,.

02:30.410 --> 02:31.989
Steve just took out

02:31.990 --> 02:32.700
Jackie.

02:32.701 --> 02:33.989
It's so upsetting.

02:33.990 --> 02:35.989
She's one of my best friends

02:35.990 --> 02:37.999
in the housement this is a

02:38.000 --> 02:38.990
total blindside.

02:38.991 --> 02:40.989
I don't know what is going

02:40.990 --> 02:41.830
on in his head.

02:41.831 --> 02:43.699
He barely talks game to

02:43.700 --> 02:44.829
anybody in the house.

02:44.830 --> 02:44.990
What is going on?

02:44.991 --> 02:47.989
Sorry, that was like a

02:47.990 --> 02:51.829
shocker.

02:51.830 --> 02:52.540
That was too much.

02:52.541 --> 02:53.989
I just walked Jackie walk

02:53.990 --> 02:54.990
out the front door and that

02:54.991 --> 02:56.989
was a blindside.

02:56.990 --> 02:57.990
I thought I would be playing

02:57.990 --> 02:58.990
to the end with her.

02:58.991 --> 03:01.539
I feel like I could have

03:01.540 --> 03:02.989
protected her better.

03:02.990 --> 03:03.990
That I should have been

03:03.990 --> 03:04.990
closer to Steve.

03:04.990 --> 03:04.991
I don't know what just

03:04.991 --> 03:05.990
happened.

03:05.990 --> 03:06.990
She's even beautiful in

03:06.991 --> 03:09.989
black and white.

03:09.990 --> 03:09.991
Wow.

03:09.991 --> 03:13.989
I done know why Steve put

03:13.990 --> 03:14.990
Jackie up and sent her home

03:14.991 --> 03:17.989
it had to be somebody that

03:17.990 --> 03:19.119
he didn't have the complete

03:19.120 --> 03:19.990
information.

03:19.991 --> 03:21.989
Somebody used that to get

03:21.990 --> 03:22.540
Jackie out of the house its

03:22.541 --> 03:30.541
with a huge hit to our team.

03:37.990 --> 03:39.989
I didn't want that hoh.

03:39.990 --> 03:40.990
Did not want this head of

03:40.990 --> 03:41.990
household.

03:41.991 --> 03:44.989
I was in good shape.

03:44.990 --> 03:46.989
I was in really, really good

03:46.990 --> 03:47.990
shape.

03:47.991 --> 03:49.949
I had done everything,

03:49.950 --> 03:50.989
hanging out... it just went

03:50.990 --> 03:51.990
down the tubes.

03:51.991 --> 03:53.999
I convinced both sides I was

03:54.000 --> 03:56.829
on their side and I

03:56.830 --> 03:58.699
completely totally lost it.

03:58.700 --> 04:00.989
My choices are James, Meg,

04:00.990 --> 04:01.990
or Jackie.

04:01.990 --> 04:02.990
No one would throw out

04:02.991 --> 04:04.289
Meg and jackiest was the

04:04.290 --> 04:04.990
only one I heard conspiracys

04:04.990 --> 04:05.990
against me.

04:05.991 --> 04:07.409
Honestly, I don't care...

04:07.410 --> 04:08.989
are you going to put me

04:08.990 --> 04:10.699
up.

04:10.700 --> 04:11.989
Some point I would back

04:11.990 --> 04:12.990
door you.

04:12.991 --> 04:15.999
Why was I a target of

04:16.000 --> 04:16.990
Jackie.

04:16.990 --> 04:17.120
I don't know, I just know

04:17.121 --> 04:19.699
you were her target.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.989
I do not know if I made

04:21.989 --> 04:22.989
I now feel Becky would have

04:22.990 --> 04:23.990
been a better target.

04:23.991 --> 04:25.989
I want to throwup.

04:25.990 --> 04:26.990
I'm going to be back

04:26.990 --> 04:27.990
doored really soon.

04:27.991 --> 04:30.989
I just lost the game.

04:30.990 --> 04:32.990
I just lost "Big Brother".

04:39.990 --> 04:40.990
What was that?

04:40.991 --> 04:47.989
I don't know.

04:47.990 --> 04:48.990
I feel like we're fighting

04:48.991 --> 04:50.989
the whole house now.

04:50.990 --> 04:58.990
Yeah, me too.

05:01.290 --> 05:02.999
We just were played.

05:03.000 --> 05:03.990
By who.

05:03.991 --> 05:05.989
I don't knowment I don't

05:05.990 --> 05:06.990
think Steve just came up

05:06.991 --> 05:08.409
with that.

05:08.410 --> 05:09.989
We're still here, we have to

05:09.990 --> 05:11.989
fight until the day that we

05:11.990 --> 05:13.989
walk out the door.

05:13.990 --> 05:14.990
I know.

05:14.991 --> 05:16.989
I mean in this game, it's

05:16.990 --> 05:18.989
like you have to play dirty.

05:18.990 --> 05:19.990
I will.

05:19.991 --> 05:21.989
I just don't think I can.

05:21.990 --> 05:22.990
I know.

05:22.990 --> 05:23.700
"The sixth sense"

05:23.701 --> 05:24.989
alliance has had two major

05:24.990 --> 05:25.999
hits, Clay and Shelli went

05:26.000 --> 05:28.989
out to the door back to book

05:28.990 --> 05:28.991
back.

05:28.991 --> 05:30.699
With Steve sending jackiest

05:30.700 --> 05:30.990
home, finally we have a

05:30.990 --> 05:31.990
shift in power.

05:31.991 --> 05:33.949
Of course I don't want to

05:33.950 --> 05:35.989
act to happy arrange Meg and

05:35.989 --> 05:36.989
Jackie but this is huge for

05:36.990 --> 05:37.830
me.

05:37.831 --> 05:39.989
She was not right to be

05:39.990 --> 05:41.989
sent home at all, at all,

05:41.990 --> 05:44.989
like... there's not a bad

05:44.990 --> 05:45.990
thing to say about either of

05:45.990 --> 05:46.990
you guys.

05:46.991 --> 05:49.989
I don't understand why... and

05:49.990 --> 05:51.989
what kills me is he doesn't

05:51.990 --> 05:53.989
talk to me at all.

05:53.990 --> 05:55.949
I wish he would have a

05:55.950 --> 05:56.700
conversation before that

05:56.700 --> 05:56.990
happened.

05:56.991 --> 05:58.989
He stood up and said he had

05:58.990 --> 05:59.990
his mind made.

05:59.991 --> 06:01.989
So he didn't really give

06:01.990 --> 06:03.989
anyone any explanation.

06:03.990 --> 06:05.989
Do you want to talk to

06:05.990 --> 06:05.991
people.

06:05.991 --> 06:07.409
I think I'm good.

06:07.410 --> 06:08.410
You're good.

06:08.410 --> 06:08.990
You know?

06:08.990 --> 06:09.990
He didn't even have a

06:09.990 --> 06:10.990
conversation with her before

06:10.990 --> 06:11.990
he put her up.

06:11.991 --> 06:13.829
He's like I'm good.

06:13.830 --> 06:14.989
I know what I'm doing.

06:14.990 --> 06:16.989
I'm sorry, I don't feel

06:16.990 --> 06:17.990
bad for him, is that

06:17.990 --> 06:18.950
horrible.

06:18.951 --> 06:19.989
No, why would you?

06:19.990 --> 06:20.990
I done know what the... happy.

06:20.990 --> 06:21.990
All I know is it is a lot to

06:21.991 --> 06:29.991
process right now.

06:33.990 --> 06:37.989
It's okay.

06:37.990 --> 06:40.289
Thank you so much for

06:40.290 --> 06:40.990
not...

06:40.991 --> 06:43.289
I'm ecstatic that Steve

06:43.290 --> 06:44.989
kept Liz and I safe during

06:44.990 --> 06:45.990
this double he vichblingts I

06:45.991 --> 06:48.699
know if one of us win this

06:48.700 --> 06:51.989
hoh we have to keep him safe.

06:51.990 --> 06:52.830
Steve no one thinks

06:52.831 --> 06:53.989
you're a bad person in this

06:53.990 --> 06:54.700
game.

06:54.701 --> 07:02.701
I know you feel horrible.

07:02.990 --> 07:03.990
You okay?

07:03.990 --> 07:04.990
At least it's not you out

07:04.990 --> 07:05.540
that door.

07:05.541 --> 07:06.989
It could have been you.

07:06.990 --> 07:08.989
I just didn't want to do

07:08.990 --> 07:09.990
this.

07:09.990 --> 07:10.990
I know, I know.

07:10.991 --> 07:12.989
But you know what, this is

07:12.990 --> 07:13.999
"Big Brother".

07:14.000 --> 07:18.989
It's your first hoh.

07:18.990 --> 07:20.999
It's okay.

07:21.000 --> 07:21.990
.

07:21.990 --> 07:22.410
Be strong.

07:22.411 --> 07:23.989
I didn't want to do this.

07:23.990 --> 07:24.990
I know.

07:24.990 --> 07:25.990
Nobody wants to.

07:25.991 --> 07:27.989
You had to do it twice.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.289
I know, I know.

07:30.290 --> 07:32.539
You're going to be okay.

07:32.540 --> 07:33.989
Everyone in this house

07:33.990 --> 07:34.990
knows you have a huge heart

07:34.990 --> 07:35.990
not one took it personally.

07:35.991 --> 07:37.989
I can't talk right now.

07:37.990 --> 07:38.990
I cannot talk right now.

07:38.991 --> 07:40.539
Can I get...

07:40.540 --> 07:41.989
we'll get out.

07:41.990 --> 07:43.289
Just relax.

07:43.290 --> 07:44.290
I'll close the door.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
About 50% acting.

07:58.830 --> 08:01.989
I got to keep calm with

08:01.990 --> 08:05.989
Steve, man.

08:05.990 --> 08:06.990
I'm just trying to think

08:06.991 --> 08:09.409
of like okay, what happened,

08:09.410 --> 08:09.990
happened.

08:09.990 --> 08:10.410
But what's the future.

08:10.410 --> 08:10.990
Okay.

08:10.990 --> 08:11.990
This could make-or-break

08:11.990 --> 08:12.990
our situation going into

08:12.990 --> 08:13.990
this hoh comp because right

08:13.991 --> 08:16.699
now we are three.

08:16.700 --> 08:16.990
Yeah.

08:16.991 --> 08:19.289
We need help.

08:19.290 --> 08:19.990
We have our backs up

08:19.991 --> 08:21.829
against the wall.

08:21.830 --> 08:23.989
We're outnumbered.

08:23.990 --> 08:24.990
Are the tears over.

08:24.991 --> 08:27.989
Yeah, I'm sorry, Johnnie

08:27.990 --> 08:28.990
mack.

08:28.991 --> 08:29.999
Girl gets crazy

08:30.000 --> 08:30.990
sometimes.

08:30.990 --> 08:31.990
I felt like if I didn't

08:31.991 --> 08:33.699
lose it when you asked may

08:33.700 --> 08:36.989
not to, someone with have

08:36.990 --> 08:38.989
gotten up and it would have

08:38.990 --> 08:46.990
been me.

08:48.990 --> 08:51.989
We're all dwindling down.

08:51.990 --> 08:52.990
We need to work with that

08:52.990 --> 08:53.990
side of the house.

08:53.990 --> 08:54.990
I think they're going to

08:54.991 --> 08:56.989
be like...

08:56.990 --> 09:01.409
Steve had it somewhere.

09:01.410 --> 09:02.989
We can get him back.

09:02.990 --> 09:04.289
We need his help.

09:04.290 --> 09:05.989
The house is definitely

09:05.990 --> 09:06.990
split right now.

09:06.991 --> 09:08.989
Every group is trying to

09:08.990 --> 09:10.829
pull Steve to that side to

09:10.830 --> 09:11.989
get that extra vote because

09:11.990 --> 09:12.120
one or two vote kos

09:12.121 --> 09:13.989
ultimately mean the

09:13.990 --> 09:13.991
difference between someone

09:13.991 --> 09:15.539
staying in the Big Brother

09:15.540 --> 09:16.989
house or going to the jury

09:16.990 --> 09:16.991
house.

09:16.991 --> 09:17.990
There's two sides and

09:17.990 --> 09:18.990
that's it.

09:18.990 --> 09:19.990
That's it.

09:19.991 --> 09:22.989
Keep it that way.

09:22.990 --> 09:24.989
We're nice to Steve because

09:24.990 --> 09:26.289
he's...

09:26.290 --> 09:27.989
guys, this is a good

09:27.990 --> 09:30.989
group though.

09:30.990 --> 09:32.989
We can win.

09:32.990 --> 09:34.949
We have better players.

09:34.950 --> 09:36.989
We have a powerhouse, we

09:36.990 --> 09:38.989
really do.

09:38.990 --> 09:39.990
Except for me.

09:39.991 --> 09:41.989
We have three powerhouses

09:41.990 --> 09:42.830
and Meg.

09:42.831 --> 09:50.289
I'm sorry, you guys.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.539
Do you want to talk?

09:52.540 --> 09:53.989
Of course.

09:53.990 --> 09:55.289
Okay.

09:55.290 --> 09:55.990
Yeah, absolutely.

09:55.990 --> 09:56.950
Cuz I definitely owe this

09:56.950 --> 09:57.410
to you.

09:57.410 --> 09:57.990
Yeah.

09:57.990 --> 09:58.990
Because I was not

09:58.991 --> 10:00.989
prepared to do an hoh so I

10:00.990 --> 10:00.991
didn't have noms in mind

10:00.991 --> 10:01.990
when I wanted.

10:01.991 --> 10:03.989
I was thinking about

10:03.990 --> 10:03.991
conversations I have had

10:03.991 --> 10:04.990
with people and

10:04.989 --> 10:05.540
with people.

10:05.541 --> 10:07.989
And Jackie, she is the only

10:07.990 --> 10:09.699
person I have heard anything

10:09.700 --> 10:10.989
bad about me, coming after

10:10.990 --> 10:11.120
me.

10:11.121 --> 10:12.989
I done know how true it is.

10:12.990 --> 10:14.119
Jackie of all people in

10:14.120 --> 10:18.989
this house, never... had any

10:18.990 --> 10:19.990
intention of putting you up

10:19.990 --> 10:20.990
ever.

10:20.990 --> 10:21.700
Okay.

10:21.701 --> 10:22.989
Where is that coming from

10:22.990 --> 10:24.989
one person?

10:24.990 --> 10:24.991
If you had to guess you

10:24.991 --> 10:28.989
would probably be right.

10:28.990 --> 10:30.989
We know where this whole

10:30.990 --> 10:32.989
idea came from.

10:32.990 --> 10:35.409
And that's why it's easier

10:35.410 --> 10:37.989
for us to not have hard

10:37.990 --> 10:38.290
feelings.

10:38.291 --> 10:39.989
Well, I have to reason to

10:39.990 --> 10:41.119
have hard feelings.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.989
It works in your favor to

10:42.990 --> 10:43.990
allow them to think that way,.

10:43.990 --> 10:44.540
We're seeing the big

10:44.540 --> 10:44.990
picture in the game.

10:44.990 --> 10:45.290
Exactly.

10:45.291 --> 10:46.409
Thank you.

10:46.410 --> 10:47.989
Meg and beckie are

10:47.990 --> 10:49.289
telling me that there are no

10:49.290 --> 10:50.989
hard feelings, that they are

10:50.990 --> 10:52.989
not mad at me and blaming my

10:52.990 --> 10:53.990
entire hoh on vanessament I

10:53.991 --> 10:55.119
done know why they are

10:55.120 --> 10:56.699
believing that, that is

10:56.700 --> 10:57.989
draet for me, or they're

10:57.990 --> 10:59.989
fantastic liars and I really

10:59.990 --> 10:59.991
respect their game.

10:59.991 --> 11:02.989
If you can keep this

11:02.990 --> 11:03.990
quiet... we can bury the

11:03.990 --> 11:04.990
hatchet.

11:04.991 --> 11:06.989
We'll bury that hatchet.

11:06.990 --> 11:07.990
Okay.

11:07.991 --> 11:09.699
It's so up setting to see

11:09.700 --> 11:11.989
Jackie leave but it's time

11:11.990 --> 11:14.989
to wipe off the cry baby

11:14.990 --> 11:16.539
tears because an hoh needs

11:16.540 --> 11:17.699
to be won to get revenge for

11:17.700 --> 11:18.700
Jackie

11:28.990 --> 11:30.990
whooo!

11:31.990 --> 11:33.999
Yeah, oh my God, I love

11:34.000 --> 11:35.989
emojis.

11:35.990 --> 11:38.289
We walk out in the yard and

11:38.290 --> 11:40.949
we see all of these cool

11:40.950 --> 11:40.990
emojies.

11:40.991 --> 11:42.539
And I notice there are a

11:42.540 --> 11:44.539
couple former house guest

11:44.540 --> 11:44.990
emojies.

11:44.991 --> 11:46.989
I see my girl Nicole.

11:46.990 --> 11:50.989
I also see Jack.

11:50.990 --> 11:52.989
And ja's Costa, I'm in need

11:52.990 --> 11:57.989
of a prayer for this win.

11:57.990 --> 11:59.989
How guest, the power is up

11:59.990 --> 12:00.990
for grabs, as the outgoing

12:00.991 --> 12:02.829
head of household, I'm not

12:02.830 --> 12:03.989
eligible to compete.

12:03.990 --> 12:04.990
The Big Brother house is

12:04.991 --> 12:06.949
full of mixed emotions.

12:06.950 --> 12:07.989
But tonight you'll be

12:07.990 --> 12:10.989
playing a game of mixed

12:10.990 --> 12:10.991
emojies.

12:10.991 --> 12:12.989
This competition will be

12:12.990 --> 12:13.990
played tournament style with

12:13.991 --> 12:15.289
a series of head-to-head

12:15.290 --> 12:15.990
matches.

12:15.991 --> 12:17.989
In each match, two of you

12:17.990 --> 12:18.990
will step up to the podium

12:18.991 --> 12:21.989
to face off.

12:21.990 --> 12:22.990
A question will appear on

12:22.990 --> 12:23.990
the screen in front of you.

12:23.991 --> 12:25.989
Each question has three

12:25.990 --> 12:26.990
possible answers.

12:26.991 --> 12:28.989
When the grid of mixed

12:28.990 --> 12:30.999
emojies appear, be the first

12:31.000 --> 12:32.539
to ring?

12:32.540 --> 12:33.000
With the correct answer, if

12:33.001 --> 12:34.989
you are correct, you

12:34.990 --> 12:35.990
eliminate your opponent in

12:35.990 --> 12:36.990
the tournament.

12:36.990 --> 12:37.990
Answer incorrectly and you

12:37.991 --> 12:39.989
will be eliminated and your

12:39.990 --> 12:40.990
opponent will advance of the

12:40.990 --> 12:41.990
last player left in the

12:41.990 --> 12:42.990
tournament will be the new

12:42.990 --> 12:43.990
head of household.

12:43.991 --> 12:47.989
(Applause)

12:47.990 --> 12:49.989
Let's fill in our bracket,

12:49.990 --> 12:51.989
in the first match James

12:51.990 --> 12:54.989
against Meg.

12:54.990 --> 12:56.989
Me and meggett drawn to

12:56.990 --> 12:57.120
play each other.

12:57.121 --> 12:58.989
I was like crap, it really

12:58.990 --> 13:00.989
sucks that I'm up against a

13:00.990 --> 13:00.991
person that I really trust

13:00.991 --> 13:02.539
in the housement because we

13:02.540 --> 13:04.989
done win this hoh they're

13:04.990 --> 13:05.990
going to just hurl another

13:05.990 --> 13:06.990
grenade at us.

13:06.991 --> 13:08.539
This hoh is huge.

13:08.540 --> 13:11.989
John will be facing Austin.

13:11.990 --> 13:13.289
Oh, qua.

13:13.290 --> 13:14.989
In the next match,

13:14.990 --> 13:17.989
Vanessa will be competing

13:17.990 --> 13:22.989
against Julia.

13:22.990 --> 13:23.990
It's no secret that I

13:23.991 --> 13:25.989
have an arch Nemesis in the

13:25.990 --> 13:26.990
house that is Becky.

13:26.991 --> 13:28.539
Either myself, Austin, Julia

13:28.540 --> 13:29.989
or Liz really needs to win

13:29.990 --> 13:30.990
or one of us will end up

13:30.990 --> 13:31.990
going home.

13:31.991 --> 13:33.989
In the final round, Becky

13:33.990 --> 13:39.989
competing against Liz.

13:39.990 --> 13:40.990
James and Meg step on up.

13:40.990 --> 13:41.990
You two will be facing off

13:41.990 --> 13:42.990
first.

13:42.991 --> 13:44.989
Let's bring it jamesie.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.989
Here's our first question.

13:46.990 --> 13:54.990
Which emoji is four in a row.

13:56.990 --> 13:58.949
I'm looking at the emojis

13:58.950 --> 13:59.989
on the screen to see which

13:59.990 --> 14:01.829
one appears four times in a

14:01.830 --> 14:02.989
row and I realize that the

14:02.990 --> 14:03.990
emoji with the bow tie

14:03.991 --> 14:05.699
appears four times in a row

14:05.700 --> 14:09.949
and I buzz in my answer.

14:09.950 --> 14:10.989
Meg, you are the first to

14:10.990 --> 14:11.990
ring in with the face of the

14:11.991 --> 14:14.989
bow tie and you are correct.

14:14.990 --> 14:16.989
Yeah!

14:16.990 --> 14:17.990
Congratulations, Meg, you

14:17.990 --> 14:18.990
are advancing to the next

14:18.990 --> 14:18.991
round.

14:18.991 --> 14:20.989
Sorry James, you have been

14:20.990 --> 14:20.991
eliminated.

14:20.991 --> 14:22.989
John and Austin, it's time

14:22.990 --> 14:23.540
to face off.

14:23.541 --> 14:24.989
Now that I'm out of this

14:24.990 --> 14:25.990
competition, we're down a

14:25.991 --> 14:27.989
soldier and I've got to put

14:27.990 --> 14:30.989
on my face for Meg, Becky

14:30.990 --> 14:32.989
and John and hope three they

14:32.990 --> 14:33.990
can pull out a win for our

14:33.990 --> 14:34.990
side of the house.

14:34.990 --> 14:35.990
All right, here is your

14:35.990 --> 14:36.000
question.

14:36.001 --> 14:39.949
Which emoji is located three

14:39.950 --> 14:40.989
below the emoji crying at

14:40.990 --> 14:46.989
the memory wall?

14:46.990 --> 14:49.699
The crying emoji, I look

14:49.700 --> 14:50.989
three below it and boom,

14:50.990 --> 14:52.989
there's the sleepy guy to

14:52.990 --> 14:54.949
the left.

14:54.950 --> 14:55.989
John, you rang in with

14:55.990 --> 14:57.989
the emoji senatoring to the

14:57.990 --> 14:57.991
left.

14:57.991 --> 14:59.989
You are correct, John and

14:59.990 --> 15:00.990
you will be advancing to the

15:00.990 --> 15:01.990
next round.

15:01.991 --> 15:03.949
I'm sorry, Austin, you have

15:03.950 --> 15:04.989
been eliminated from the

15:04.990 --> 15:05.120
game.

15:05.121 --> 15:06.989
All right, Vanessa and

15:06.990 --> 15:07.999
Julia, time to face off.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.289
I feel like I'm beating

15:10.290 --> 15:12.699
the odds, not only did I

15:12.700 --> 15:14.539
survive an eviction where I

15:14.540 --> 15:16.989
got put up as the back door

15:16.990 --> 15:17.990
target but survived a double

15:17.990 --> 15:18.700
eviction with.

15:18.701 --> 15:19.989
This hoh I will go for the

15:19.990 --> 15:21.989
win 110%.

15:21.990 --> 15:23.409
Let's take a look at your

15:23.410 --> 15:23.990
question.

15:23.990 --> 15:24.990
Which emoji directly

15:24.991 --> 15:32.991
surrounds the angel emoji.

15:38.990 --> 15:39.990
Julia, you are the first

15:39.991 --> 15:42.989
to ring in with the sad face

15:42.990 --> 15:43.990
with three tears.

15:43.990 --> 15:44.990
You are correct and will be

15:44.991 --> 15:46.989
advancing.

15:46.990 --> 15:48.989
I'm sorry, Vanessa, you

15:48.990 --> 15:50.409
have been eliminated.

15:50.410 --> 15:51.829
I worry about my own

15:51.830 --> 15:52.989
safety and the safety of

15:52.990 --> 15:53.410
Austin and the twins.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.539
So for the sake of my

15:55.540 --> 15:56.989
alliance I'm really rooting

15:56.990 --> 15:57.950
for Liz here.

15:57.951 --> 15:58.989
All right, Becky and Liz,

15:58.990 --> 16:00.989
it's your turn to face off.

16:00.990 --> 16:01.990
I'm really hoping that I

16:01.991 --> 16:03.989
win against Liz because I do

16:03.990 --> 16:04.990
fear someone on the other

16:04.990 --> 16:05.540
side of the house.

16:05.541 --> 16:06.989
So I naturally want to knock

16:06.990 --> 16:07.990
her out of this game.

16:07.991 --> 16:10.989
It's us versus them.

16:10.990 --> 16:11.999
Which emoji is located

16:12.000 --> 16:13.989
four above the emoji with

16:13.990 --> 16:21.990
head phones.

16:29.290 --> 16:30.290
Liz,

16:30.291 --> 16:31.989
you rang in with the

16:31.990 --> 16:32.990
zipper mouth.

16:32.991 --> 16:35.989
And you are correct.

16:35.990 --> 16:37.989
Liz, you will be advancing.

16:37.990 --> 16:39.829
I'm sorry, Becky, you have

16:39.830 --> 16:40.989
been eliminated.

16:40.990 --> 16:41.990
All right, the final four

16:41.991 --> 16:43.989
have been set.

16:43.990 --> 16:45.989
It's Meg versus John and

16:45.990 --> 16:46.990
Julia versus Liz.

16:46.991 --> 16:49.699
Meg and John, step on up.

16:49.700 --> 16:50.989
Let's take a look at the

16:50.990 --> 16:51.999
next question.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.989
Which emoji is the only... seen

16:56.990 --> 17:03.699
only twice.

17:03.700 --> 17:04.989
I'm trying to figure out

17:04.990 --> 17:06.989
which of these are only

17:06.990 --> 17:07.990
twice on the board.

17:07.991 --> 17:10.989
It's so difficult.

17:10.990 --> 17:12.989
I keep second-guessing

17:12.990 --> 17:13.990
myself because I'm trying to

17:13.991 --> 17:15.989
make sure that I'm really

17:15.990 --> 17:17.989
right before I ring in an

17:17.990 --> 17:19.829
answer.

17:19.830 --> 17:20.989
And before I know it,

17:20.990 --> 17:22.829
it's too late.

17:22.830 --> 17:23.949
John, you are the first

17:23.950 --> 17:25.989
to ring in with the punk

17:25.990 --> 17:26.990
rocker.

17:26.991 --> 17:28.989
You are correct and will be

17:28.990 --> 17:30.289
advancing.

17:30.290 --> 17:31.989
I'm sorry, Meg, you have

17:31.990 --> 17:35.989
been eliminated.

17:35.990 --> 17:36.700
I'm the last one left on

17:36.700 --> 17:36.990
our side of the house.

17:36.990 --> 17:37.990
And I might be the smartest

17:37.990 --> 17:38.990
one.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.989
And I am feeling pretty good

17:40.990 --> 17:41.990
going into this final round.

17:41.991 --> 17:43.989
Thank you punk rock emoji

17:43.990 --> 17:46.989
guy for standing out so well.

17:46.990 --> 17:48.989
Next up is Julia versus

17:48.990 --> 17:51.989
Liz.

17:51.990 --> 17:53.289
Battle of the twins.

17:53.290 --> 17:54.989
Oh, gosh.

17:54.990 --> 17:55.990
Nothing like a little

17:55.990 --> 17:56.990
sibling rivalry.

17:56.991 --> 17:58.989
Let's take a look at your

17:58.990 --> 17:59.990
question.

17:59.991 --> 18:03.539
Which emoji is the emoji

18:03.540 --> 18:04.989
with glasses with question

18:04.990 --> 18:12.990
marks on the right surround?

18:18.990 --> 18:19.990
Julia, you were the first

18:19.991 --> 18:21.989
to ring in with the mustache

18:21.990 --> 18:22.990
man.

18:22.991 --> 18:24.989
That is incorrect.

18:24.990 --> 18:26.539
The correct answer was the

18:26.540 --> 18:29.699
emoji wagging a finger.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.989
Oh!

18:31.989 --> 18:32.989
I picked the emoji with

18:32.990 --> 18:33.999
the question marks on the

18:34.000 --> 18:36.989
wrong side.

18:36.990 --> 18:37.990
Losing to my sister.

18:37.991 --> 18:40.989
Great job, Julia.

18:40.990 --> 18:41.990
All right.

18:41.991 --> 18:43.989
It's the championship round.

18:43.990 --> 18:44.990
It all comes down to this.

18:44.991 --> 18:46.989
The final question, John

18:46.990 --> 18:47.990
versus Liz.

18:47.990 --> 18:48.990
Whoever answers this

18:48.990 --> 18:49.990
correctly will be the new

18:49.991 --> 18:53.119
head of household.

18:53.120 --> 18:54.289
We're going into the last

18:54.290 --> 18:55.290
round of this competition.

18:55.291 --> 18:56.989
It's me versus Liz.

18:56.990 --> 18:57.990
Our side of the house versus

18:57.990 --> 18:58.990
their side of the house.

18:58.990 --> 18:59.990
This is it.

18:59.990 --> 19:00.990
This is the war we've been

19:00.990 --> 19:01.990
waiting for.

19:01.991 --> 19:03.990
Let's go.

19:11.990 --> 19:12.990
Can't get enough Big Brother?

19:12.991 --> 19:14.989
There is never a dull moment.

19:14.990 --> 19:16.539
See what's happening inside the

19:16.540 --> 19:17.949
house whenever you want

19:17.950 --> 19:18.950
with the live feed.

19:20.950 --> 19:21.990
You know you want to watch

19:27.990 --> 19:29.030
my fingers are crossed,

19:29.990 --> 19:30.990
my toes are crossed.

19:30.990 --> 19:31.990
I'm holding my breath.

19:31.990 --> 19:32.990
Johnnie mack needs to win

19:32.991 --> 19:35.409
this one or else one of my

19:35.410 --> 19:36.989
people in this house are

19:36.990 --> 19:38.829
headed out the door yet

19:38.830 --> 19:39.989
again this week.

19:39.990 --> 19:41.699
Let's take a look at the

19:41.700 --> 19:42.989
final question.

19:42.990 --> 19:45.989
Which emoji is seen five

19:45.990 --> 19:53.990
times?

20:01.700 --> 20:02.989
Liz, you were the first

20:02.990 --> 20:04.409
to ring in with the heart

20:04.410 --> 20:05.989
eyes emoji.

20:05.990 --> 20:06.990
I'm shaking in my San

20:06.991 --> 20:08.989
dahls am I'm like oh my gosh,

20:08.990 --> 20:10.119
did I just make the biggest

20:10.120 --> 20:10.990
mission take ever.

20:10.991 --> 20:12.989
Did I just pull a Julia?

20:12.990 --> 20:14.989
Is it right sm.

20:14.990 --> 20:15.540
Congratulations, lids,

20:15.541 --> 20:16.989
you are the new head of

20:16.990 --> 20:17.990
household.

20:17.991 --> 20:20.989
(Applause)

20:20.990 --> 20:22.989
I'm so ecstatic that I

20:22.990 --> 20:24.989
just won hoh.

20:24.990 --> 20:25.999
My sister and I are safe for

20:26.000 --> 20:26.990
another week.

20:26.991 --> 20:28.989
Our alliance is back in

20:28.990 --> 20:29.950
control.

20:29.951 --> 20:30.989
Some lines have been

20:30.990 --> 20:31.990
obviously drawn in the sand.

20:31.990 --> 20:32.990
I feel as though you're not

20:32.991 --> 20:34.989
working with me, then you're

20:34.990 --> 20:35.700
against me.

20:35.700 --> 20:36.410
How did you get that.

20:36.411 --> 20:37.989
You're way smarter than me,

20:37.990 --> 20:37.991
girl.

20:37.991 --> 20:40.989
You were in the zone.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.989
Liz wins hoh and this is

20:42.990 --> 20:44.989
pretty much one of the worst

20:44.990 --> 20:45.410
situations that can happen.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.989
I feel like I've always got

20:47.990 --> 20:48.990
my back against the wall.

20:48.990 --> 20:49.950
I hope they remember that I

20:49.951 --> 20:50.989
did not put them on the

20:50.990 --> 20:51.990
chopping block whenever I

20:51.991 --> 20:53.989
was hoh and I'm safe this

20:53.990 --> 20:54.990
week.

20:54.991 --> 20:56.409
Good work.

20:56.410 --> 20:58.989
I'm terrified with Liz

20:58.990 --> 20:59.990
winning hoh.

20:59.991 --> 21:01.409
I know that Vanessa will be

21:01.410 --> 21:02.410
in Liz's ear.

21:02.411 --> 21:03.949
I should probably start

21:03.950 --> 21:05.989
packing now.

21:05.990 --> 21:07.289
Liz, you get a letter

21:07.290 --> 21:08.989
from momma an papa.

21:08.990 --> 21:10.989
And I get pictures.

21:10.990 --> 21:14.989
Yay!

21:14.990 --> 21:16.989
I want some twin pics.

21:16.990 --> 21:18.989
I want a picture of Angela

21:18.990 --> 21:18.991
too.

21:18.991 --> 21:20.119
I feel like I've done

21:20.120 --> 21:28.120
seven days in one day.

21:34.990 --> 21:36.539
Oh my God,.

21:36.540 --> 21:37.989
With lizes ahead of

21:37.990 --> 21:38.990
household this couldn't be

21:38.990 --> 21:39.990
any better.

21:39.991 --> 21:41.989
I was supposed to be Liz's

21:41.990 --> 21:43.699
knight in shining armour and

21:43.700 --> 21:44.989
I've become her squire.

21:44.990 --> 21:45.990
I guess you could say I'm

21:45.991 --> 21:47.989
her first lady.

21:47.990 --> 21:48.990
I'm fine with that,

21:48.990 --> 21:49.990
though.

21:49.990 --> 21:50.990
I'm open minded.

21:50.991 --> 21:55.989
You get the... room too.

21:55.990 --> 21:56.990
Never a week.

21:56.991 --> 21:58.989
I know, it's awesome.

21:58.990 --> 21:59.990
You get everything you want.

21:59.990 --> 22:00.990
It will be a fun week.

22:00.991 --> 22:02.289
Yeah, it will be a fun

22:02.290 --> 22:02.990
week.

22:02.991 --> 22:10.991
Yeah.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.989
> Why do I suck as

22:17.990 --> 22:24.989
everything.

22:24.990 --> 22:26.829
Why did they... by

22:26.830 --> 22:27.290
changing the plans.

22:27.291 --> 22:29.999
We need a target.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.949
We're all going home.

22:31.950 --> 22:31.988
Yup?

22:31.989 --> 22:32.989
I'm really worried with

22:32.990 --> 22:35.989
Liz winning hoh.

22:35.990 --> 22:37.989
If she was making decisions

22:37.990 --> 22:38.990
herself, I feel I would be

22:38.990 --> 22:39.990
safe but that's not the

22:39.990 --> 22:40.990
case.

22:40.991 --> 22:43.989
Vanessa going to be posted

22:43.990 --> 22:49.989
house of her room until I go

22:49.990 --> 22:52.949
home get me on a skewer.

22:52.950 --> 22:55.119
Why would Steve... you

22:55.120 --> 22:55.990
though.

22:55.991 --> 22:57.989
The only thing that... it

22:57.990 --> 23:00.539
was Vanessa.

23:00.540 --> 23:01.989
She rules other people.

23:01.990 --> 23:02.990
Vanessa is not just a

23:02.990 --> 23:03.990
person.

23:03.990 --> 23:04.990
She convinces other people

23:04.991 --> 23:08.989
to do her work for her.

23:08.990 --> 23:11.539
She ruined so many plans and

23:11.540 --> 23:13.119
hohs and she has been behind

23:13.120 --> 23:15.989
so much of what happens in

23:15.990 --> 23:16.950
this house.

23:16.951 --> 23:17.989
She is that chess player.

23:17.990 --> 23:19.989
She is that poker player.

23:19.990 --> 23:22.289
It's going to take a long

23:22.290 --> 23:24.289
time to get that girl out

23:24.290 --> 23:26.989
again.

23:26.990 --> 23:29.989
But... my target...

23:29.990 --> 23:31.990
I will be... without a

23:33.990 --> 23:34.990
doubt

23:53.990 --> 23:58.989
(laughter)

23:58.990 --> 23:59.950
Just go to sleep.

23:59.951 --> 24:00.989
You don't even have to think

24:00.990 --> 24:06.989
about it.

24:06.990 --> 24:13.989
Optimal target, Becky.

24:13.990 --> 24:15.990
I can't put her up... okay.

24:36.700 --> 24:37.989
I used to have dreams of

24:37.990 --> 24:38.990
getting lost in space or

24:38.991 --> 24:40.539
something, like you float

24:40.540 --> 24:41.989
away into nothingness.

24:41.990 --> 24:43.989
That would sucked.

24:43.990 --> 24:43.991
Yeah.

24:43.991 --> 24:46.989
It's my worst fear is

24:46.990 --> 24:47.990
getting strapped in the

24:47.990 --> 24:48.410
ocean, in a little small

24:48.410 --> 24:48.990
life vest.

24:48.991 --> 24:50.539
What were you were in a

24:50.540 --> 24:50.990
vaught and got hit by an

24:50.991 --> 24:53.829
iceberg.

24:53.830 --> 24:54.989
Well, you have seen

24:54.989 --> 24:55.830
I know.

24:55.831 --> 24:56.999
You see how that works out.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.989
I know, Jack and rose

24:58.990 --> 24:59.990
Dawson.

24:59.991 --> 25:03.989
Rose is like never let go.

25:03.990 --> 25:05.989
And you just drift and you

25:05.990 --> 25:07.989
let go.

25:07.990 --> 25:08.990
For love.

25:08.990 --> 25:09.990
For her.

25:09.990 --> 25:10.990
Titanic is the best movie

25:10.990 --> 25:11.990
ever, if you haven't watched

25:11.991 --> 25:13.989
it, you need to watch it.

25:13.990 --> 25:16.989
So many layers to it you

25:16.990 --> 25:18.989
couldn't get...

25:18.990 --> 25:19.990
if you would have got on

25:19.991 --> 25:22.989
it, it would have sunk.

25:22.990 --> 25:23.990
It would have sunk.

25:23.990 --> 25:24.990
They couldn't alternate?

25:24.991 --> 25:30.989
That was kind of... they

25:30.990 --> 25:31.990
could have rotated.

25:31.991 --> 25:33.119
I think they could have

25:33.120 --> 25:34.989
done shifted.

25:34.990 --> 25:35.990
I think if Liz was on

25:35.991 --> 25:37.699
that iceberg, I think you

25:37.700 --> 25:38.989
would let her have it.

25:38.990 --> 25:40.699
I would, as a gentleman.

25:40.700 --> 25:41.989
I'm supposed to do it.

25:41.990 --> 25:46.989
You're supposed to do it.

25:46.990 --> 25:50.989
Yeah.

25:50.990 --> 25:51.120
What's the most important

25:51.121 --> 25:54.539
thing to you.

25:54.540 --> 25:55.989
Absolutely... I'm thinking

25:55.990 --> 25:57.949
Meg and John and one of them

25:57.950 --> 25:59.409
gets the veto, takes it, get

25:59.410 --> 26:02.539
off and then it's perfect.

26:02.540 --> 26:03.410
I don't like Becky

26:03.411 --> 26:04.989
because of what she did last

26:04.990 --> 26:05.990
night.

26:05.991 --> 26:07.289
It is a good plan.

26:07.290 --> 26:08.989
So Liz says that her

26:08.990 --> 26:10.989
target is Becky and I'm like

26:10.990 --> 26:10.991
whew.

26:10.991 --> 26:11.990
All right.

26:11.990 --> 26:12.990
She's willing to get the

26:12.990 --> 26:13.990
blood on her hands and I

26:13.990 --> 26:14.990
didn't put her name out

26:14.990 --> 26:15.410
there she did.

26:15.411 --> 26:17.989
So this is great.

26:17.990 --> 26:18.990
We have a lot of pawns

26:18.990 --> 26:19.120
left.

26:19.121 --> 26:20.989
I would say the least

26:20.990 --> 26:21.990
threatening is John.

26:21.990 --> 26:22.290
Mack.

26:22.291 --> 26:23.989
You can make deals with

26:23.990 --> 26:23.991
John.

26:23.991 --> 26:26.539
He can win a lot of comps,

26:26.540 --> 26:26.990
that's a fact.

26:26.991 --> 26:28.949
Meg is not threatening.

26:28.950 --> 26:29.989
What if you put John and

26:29.990 --> 26:31.989
Becky up against each other.

26:31.990 --> 26:32.990
Because Becky went after

26:32.990 --> 26:32.991
you.

26:32.991 --> 26:34.409
Johnny likes the Becky

26:34.410 --> 26:35.829
scenario, here is why.

26:35.830 --> 26:38.119
Becky can be great at

26:38.120 --> 26:39.120
a... and swron can beat her.

26:39.121 --> 26:41.949
What if she wins pov.

26:41.950 --> 26:41.990
We still have the option

26:41.991 --> 26:43.989
of putting up Meg and send

26:43.990 --> 26:45.989
John home or put up James

26:45.990 --> 26:46.410
and send him home.

26:46.411 --> 26:48.989
No, no.

26:48.990 --> 26:49.990
John as a back door.

26:49.991 --> 26:52.989
No, sorry.

26:52.990 --> 26:54.989
Right now Becky

26:54.990 --> 26:56.829
guarantees us final four

26:56.830 --> 26:58.989
unless they at the play

26:58.990 --> 26:59.990
terribly strong hot.

26:59.990 --> 27:00.990
Today is the best day ever.

27:00.990 --> 27:01.990
I know.

27:01.991 --> 27:03.989
I'm so happy about it.

27:03.990 --> 27:06.989
All right, cool.

27:06.990 --> 27:07.990
What do we...

27:07.991 --> 27:09.989
now that sixth sense is

27:09.990 --> 27:13.989
down two key members, it's

27:13.990 --> 27:16.289
unfortunately a dead

27:16.290 --> 27:16.990
alliance.

27:16.991 --> 27:18.989
It's time to torm something

27:18.990 --> 27:19.700
new.

27:19.700 --> 27:19.990
Austin...

27:19.990 --> 27:20.990
yeah, I love it.

27:20.991 --> 27:25.989
I love it.

27:25.990 --> 27:29.829
I will be in the middle.

27:29.830 --> 27:31.830
This is awesome.

27:39.990 --> 27:40.990
Sorry.

27:40.991 --> 27:42.989
So I didn't know what

27:42.990 --> 27:43.990
where you guys are at and

27:43.990 --> 27:44.990
just...

27:44.991 --> 27:47.989
obviously I'm really... of

27:47.990 --> 27:48.990
what happened tonight but

27:48.991 --> 27:50.949
obviously I'm still happy

27:50.950 --> 27:52.989
that I am still in this

27:52.990 --> 27:53.540
game.

27:53.541 --> 27:54.949
So is there anything that

27:54.950 --> 27:55.989
like I should know.

27:55.990 --> 27:57.989
It's obvious that I

27:57.990 --> 28:00.989
perceived what... said to be

28:00.990 --> 28:01.990
a threat.

28:01.991 --> 28:03.539
I'm terrified with Liz

28:03.540 --> 28:04.989
winning hoh.

28:04.990 --> 28:05.990
I'm trying to save myself

28:05.991 --> 28:07.999
and I need to convince them

28:08.000 --> 28:09.989
that Vanessa is not with

28:09.990 --> 28:11.119
them, she's with herself.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.989
I was hoh last week and

28:12.990 --> 28:14.989
didn't want any of you guys

28:14.990 --> 28:15.990
to feel unsafe and I got

28:15.990 --> 28:16.990
very dirty myself in it.

28:16.991 --> 28:18.989
That was very hard.

28:18.990 --> 28:19.990
When the whole plan was

28:19.991 --> 28:21.989
to back door me, was there a

28:21.990 --> 28:24.119
master plan for that pov.

28:24.120 --> 28:25.409
Was someone supposed to

28:25.410 --> 28:26.120
throw tments I just need to

28:26.120 --> 28:26.990
know that?

28:26.991 --> 28:29.989
.

28:29.990 --> 28:29.991
Yeah.

28:29.991 --> 28:30.990
An Vanessa knew about

28:30.990 --> 28:31.990
that, right?

28:31.991 --> 28:33.989
Yes.

28:33.990 --> 28:34.990
Oh my God.

28:34.991 --> 28:36.539
When Clay and Shelli were

28:36.540 --> 28:36.990
benefitting her, she would

28:36.991 --> 28:38.989
be closer with Clay and

28:38.990 --> 28:41.699
Shelli.

28:41.700 --> 28:41.990
Do you realize how fast she

28:41.991 --> 28:44.539
was to Josh.

28:44.540 --> 28:45.989
If you don't serve a

28:45.990 --> 28:46.990
benefit, you can be back

28:46.991 --> 28:49.989
doored at any second.

28:49.990 --> 28:51.989
I'm feeling pretty sick.

28:51.990 --> 28:52.990
I knew that Vanessa was

28:52.991 --> 28:54.699
angry at me during her hoh

28:54.700 --> 28:54.990
with Jackie.

28:54.991 --> 28:56.989
But I had no clue that she

28:56.990 --> 28:58.989
was actually planning my

28:58.990 --> 28:59.990
entire demise.

28:59.990 --> 29:00.990
We needed to hear this.

29:00.990 --> 29:01.990
We're all really like

29:01.990 --> 29:02.990
mind blown.

29:02.990 --> 29:03.990
I'm mind blown.

29:03.990 --> 29:04.990
Right now I'm just sick

29:04.990 --> 29:05.950
to my stomach.

29:05.951 --> 29:06.989
I cannot believe the things

29:06.990 --> 29:07.990
that I am hearing about

29:07.990 --> 29:08.700
Vanessa.

29:08.701 --> 29:09.989
It completely makes me

29:09.990 --> 29:11.829
second-guess trusting her

29:11.830 --> 29:12.989
and all the information that

29:12.990 --> 29:14.829
we have given her.

29:14.830 --> 29:15.989
I don't know what I am going

29:15.990 --> 29:15.991
to do.

29:15.991 --> 29:18.989
But I have to make a

29:18.990 --> 29:18.991
decision.

29:18.991 --> 29:20.289
You have given use a lot

29:20.290 --> 29:20.990
to think about rate now.

29:20.991 --> 29:22.989
A lot.

29:22.990 --> 29:24.990
She is a chameleon.

29:33.990 --> 29:35.230
Be a fly on the wall inside the

29:35.990 --> 29:36.990
Big Brother house.

29:58.990 --> 29:59.990
It's heating up.

30:03.990 --> 30:09.989
Whoa, bull's eye.

30:09.990 --> 30:15.989
Whoa!

30:15.990 --> 30:16.990
Ha, ha, ha.

30:16.991 --> 30:18.699
I didn't mean for it to

30:18.700 --> 30:20.289
be a head shot.

30:20.290 --> 30:21.290
That was like perfect.

30:32.990 --> 30:34.989
This is where you do best

30:34.990 --> 30:34.991
at.

30:34.991 --> 30:36.829
James and I are going to

30:36.830 --> 30:36.990
have a...

30:36.991 --> 30:41.989
are you guys baes now,

30:41.990 --> 30:42.990
what is going on.

30:42.991 --> 30:44.989
Liz called us baes.

30:44.990 --> 30:44.991
Lately I have been

30:44.991 --> 30:45.990
hanging out with Steve.

30:45.991 --> 30:49.289
It started out as strategy.

30:49.290 --> 30:51.989
Can't do that to me, man.

30:51.990 --> 30:52.990
Are you going to come in

30:52.990 --> 30:52.991
here?

30:52.991 --> 30:53.990
No.

30:53.991 --> 30:55.989
Oh.

30:55.990 --> 30:57.989
But now it's like the kid

30:57.990 --> 31:05.990
is kind of growing on me.

31:10.990 --> 31:11.990
Me and Steve are totally

31:11.990 --> 31:12.990
different opposite people.

31:12.990 --> 31:13.990
Steve likes books.

31:13.991 --> 31:17.989
You know, I like beer.

31:17.990 --> 31:19.989
You know what a calorie

31:19.990 --> 31:19.991
is?

31:19.991 --> 31:20.990
Nope.

31:20.991 --> 31:22.989
It is the amount of

31:22.990 --> 31:23.990
energy required to raise the

31:23.991 --> 31:25.989
temperature of a cubic

31:25.990 --> 31:27.989
centimeter of water by one

31:27.990 --> 31:28.290
degree celsius.

31:28.290 --> 31:29.120
What the hell?

31:29.121 --> 31:32.989
I guess I enjoy his

31:32.990 --> 31:35.289
company.

31:35.290 --> 31:43.290
Oh, side-by-side.

31:49.990 --> 31:50.990
You know, it's just

31:50.991 --> 31:52.989
really two guys just hanging

31:52.990 --> 32:00.990
out.

32:04.990 --> 32:05.990
It's very important.

32:05.990 --> 32:06.120
What.

32:06.121 --> 32:07.989
Look, we actually need to

32:07.990 --> 32:08.990
come up with a name.

32:08.990 --> 32:09.990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:09.991 --> 32:12.989
Okay, um.

32:12.990 --> 32:13.990
Austin the twins and I

32:13.990 --> 32:14.990
are already a really close

32:14.991 --> 32:16.119
four some but it's really

32:16.120 --> 32:17.989
important that we get Steve

32:17.990 --> 32:19.989
at this point and secure the

32:19.990 --> 32:20.990
five of us working together

32:20.990 --> 32:21.990
so we can control the vote

32:21.991 --> 32:24.989
from here on out.

32:24.990 --> 32:27.989
Let's do letters, v-a, l,

32:27.990 --> 32:28.990
j, f.

32:28.991 --> 32:30.989
One vowell.

32:30.990 --> 32:34.119
S.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.989
The alternative lifestyle

32:35.990 --> 32:38.989
how about geek squad freak

32:38.990 --> 32:40.989
squad, freaky geek squadness

32:40.990 --> 32:43.989
how about the h...

32:43.990 --> 32:49.829
ultimate bitc...

32:49.830 --> 32:49.990
a lot of information has

32:49.991 --> 32:51.989
come upstairs about Vanessa

32:51.990 --> 32:52.990
doing sketchy things hine

32:52.990 --> 32:52.991
our back.

32:52.991 --> 32:54.119
At this point it's really

32:54.120 --> 32:55.829
important that we keep the

32:55.830 --> 32:56.989
peace so I'm just going to

32:56.990 --> 32:57.700
let her think that

32:57.700 --> 32:57.990
everything is cool.

32:57.991 --> 32:59.989
What about the freaky

32:59.990 --> 32:59.991
mcgeek.

32:59.991 --> 33:01.829
I like its freaky geek

33:01.830 --> 33:01.990
squad.

33:01.990 --> 33:02.990
No.

33:02.991 --> 33:06.989
We're not a geek squad.

33:06.990 --> 33:09.119
Two people in the group

33:09.120 --> 33:10.989
have glasses.

33:10.990 --> 33:10.991
Scamper.

33:10.991 --> 33:13.989
That is so good.

33:13.990 --> 33:16.409
I love it.

33:16.410 --> 33:17.290
Shh.

33:17.291 --> 33:20.119
The scamper squad.

33:20.120 --> 33:21.120
Myself, Liz, Julia,

33:21.121 --> 33:22.989
Vanessa and Steve have

33:22.990 --> 33:24.989
loosely been working

33:24.990 --> 33:25.990
together for quite a while.

33:25.991 --> 33:27.409
Now at this critical

33:27.410 --> 33:29.989
juncture of the game we are

33:29.990 --> 33:31.989
finally making this alliance

33:31.990 --> 33:32.990
official and we want to call

33:32.991 --> 33:40.991
ourselves the scamper squad.

33:52.700 --> 33:53.989
Am I going up?

33:53.990 --> 33:53.991
Huh?

33:53.991 --> 33:58.699
Am I going on the block.

33:58.700 --> 33:58.990
I done know.

33:58.991 --> 34:00.289
You talked to her, right

34:00.290 --> 34:00.990
sm.

34:00.990 --> 34:01.990
Yeah.

34:01.991 --> 34:03.989
I mean I know for a fact

34:03.990 --> 34:05.409
you're not her target.

34:05.410 --> 34:07.989
You're not her main target.

34:07.990 --> 34:09.989
Johnny is someone I would

34:09.990 --> 34:09.998
love to work with in the

34:09.999 --> 34:10.990
house.

34:10.991 --> 34:13.989
But with he had this weird,

34:13.990 --> 34:14.990
awkward Clay disa breement.

34:14.990 --> 34:15.830
You think I'm gunning for

34:15.831 --> 34:17.989
you and I am in Shelli's

34:17.990 --> 34:18.950
head, based o be what?

34:18.950 --> 34:18.990
The way things are coming

34:18.991 --> 34:22.409
together in my head.

34:22.410 --> 34:24.989
I am... and I want to get

34:24.990 --> 34:26.989
it all out on the table and

34:26.990 --> 34:27.990
hopefully put this thing to

34:27.990 --> 34:28.990
rest so that at the end of

34:28.990 --> 34:29.990
the day Johnnie and I might

34:29.991 --> 34:34.989
be able to work together.

34:34.990 --> 34:36.989
Wrning you seem like you're

34:36.990 --> 34:37.990
concerned and I'm tell ug

34:37.991 --> 34:39.289
the easiest way would be for

34:39.290 --> 34:40.000
you to go ask.

34:40.001 --> 34:41.989
If they are not telling you,

34:41.990 --> 34:42.990
I would be happy to ask on

34:42.990 --> 34:43.990
your behalf.

34:43.991 --> 34:45.989
No, I think I'm going up.

34:45.990 --> 34:46.990
Actually, let's talk.

34:46.991 --> 34:49.989
I want to... like okay.

34:49.990 --> 34:51.989
Here's the thing.

34:51.990 --> 34:53.989
I want to help you in this

34:53.990 --> 34:54.990
game.

34:54.990 --> 34:55.990
The thing is like I don't

34:55.990 --> 34:56.990
know exactly where your

34:56.990 --> 34:57.950
loyalties are at.

34:57.951 --> 34:58.989
Like I understand your

34:58.990 --> 35:00.989
relationship with Steve, it

35:00.990 --> 35:02.949
is pretty clear you have one

35:02.950 --> 35:02.990
with Becky.

35:02.991 --> 35:05.989
That being said f I tell you

35:05.990 --> 35:07.989
things in conversation, that

35:07.990 --> 35:08.990
anything won't go back to

35:08.989 --> 35:09.540
Yeah.

35:09.540 --> 35:09.990
Is that true?

35:09.990 --> 35:10.990
Yeah.

35:10.990 --> 35:11.990
Would you like my opinion

35:11.990 --> 35:12.990
about what you could do to

35:12.990 --> 35:13.990
improv your game?

35:13.990 --> 35:14.120
Yeah.

35:14.121 --> 35:16.289
The one concern I have, I

35:16.290 --> 35:17.409
think you might have

35:17.410 --> 35:20.989
something against me.

35:20.990 --> 35:22.699
Which I believe sun founded.

35:22.700 --> 35:23.700
I don't know where it could

35:23.700 --> 35:23.990
come from.

35:23.991 --> 35:26.539
But I know I'm not a bad

35:26.540 --> 35:28.409
person.

35:28.410 --> 35:29.989
I felt like I was bullied

35:29.990 --> 35:32.409
at the time, a little bit.

35:32.410 --> 35:33.989
How were you being

35:33.990 --> 35:33.991
bullied?

35:33.991 --> 35:35.989
You were asking me to

35:35.990 --> 35:36.990
throw one of thieves two

35:36.990 --> 35:37.990
people under the bus and I

35:37.991 --> 35:39.989
just had no idea what was

35:39.990 --> 35:39.991
going on.

35:39.991 --> 35:41.409
You thought I was

35:41.410 --> 35:41.990
bullying you?

35:41.991 --> 35:43.989
Yes.

35:43.990 --> 35:45.989
I think to blame me for

35:45.990 --> 35:47.829
it is like unfair.

35:47.830 --> 35:48.989
It's only coming up

35:48.990 --> 35:50.989
because you're bringing it

35:50.989 --> 35:51.989
No, I can tell there is

35:51.990 --> 35:53.989
an issue with it with you.

35:53.990 --> 35:55.699
I was just trying to give

35:55.700 --> 35:56.989
her my feelings, let her

35:56.990 --> 35:57.990
know where I'm coming from

35:57.990 --> 35:58.990
am and she doesn't like

35:58.990 --> 35:59.990
that.

35:59.990 --> 36:00.990
She knows that if people

36:00.991 --> 36:02.989
start viewing her as a bully,

36:02.990 --> 36:05.989
she's in trouble.

36:05.990 --> 36:07.289
So if they ask... are we

36:07.290 --> 36:08.989
on the same page or no?

36:08.990 --> 36:10.989
Yeah.

36:10.990 --> 36:11.990
Okay.

36:11.991 --> 36:13.539
You're using a word like

36:13.540 --> 36:14.989
bully directed to me.

36:14.990 --> 36:15.990
Yeah.

36:15.990 --> 36:16.540
Which is to the a word

36:16.541 --> 36:17.989
you use with someone that

36:17.990 --> 36:18.950
you are cool.

36:18.951 --> 36:20.999
So that worries me.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.989
So that is my reason for

36:22.990 --> 36:23.990
needing to ask the following

36:23.991 --> 36:26.949
question which is are we on

36:26.950 --> 36:27.989
the same page about that?

36:27.990 --> 36:29.289
Do you have any animosity

36:29.290 --> 36:30.989
towards me, about what went

36:30.989 --> 36:31.989
Do you think I should have

36:31.990 --> 36:33.989
handled it differently?

36:33.990 --> 36:35.999
Yeah, I don't... I don't

36:36.000 --> 36:37.989
like when you cry and yell

36:37.990 --> 36:39.989
at people.

36:39.990 --> 36:40.990
I don't know what to do

36:40.990 --> 36:41.990
with this guy.

36:41.991 --> 36:44.989
Like I'm literally trying to

36:44.990 --> 36:46.989
pull him into an alliance.

36:46.990 --> 36:47.990
I'm trying to tell him I

36:47.990 --> 36:48.990
trust him and I would love

36:48.991 --> 36:49.999
for him to trust me.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.119
But he's doing his best to

36:52.120 --> 36:55.989
make sure that I want to

36:55.990 --> 36:55.991
target him.

36:55.991 --> 36:56.990
Yell at people?

36:56.990 --> 36:57.990
Uh-huh.

36:57.990 --> 36:58.990
Okay.

36:58.990 --> 36:59.000
All right.

36:59.001 --> 37:00.989
Well, I'm really sorry you

37:00.990 --> 37:02.949
feel that that way.

37:02.950 --> 37:03.989
It will never happen with

37:03.990 --> 37:05.699
you, Johnny, you don't have

37:05.700 --> 37:06.290
to worry about it, no

37:06.290 --> 37:06.990
worries, man.

37:06.991 --> 37:14.991
All right

37:23.990 --> 37:25.989
.

37:25.990 --> 37:26.990
Johnny mack, let me tell

37:26.991 --> 37:29.999
you, I have mad info for you

37:30.000 --> 37:30.990
guys.

37:30.991 --> 37:32.989
First of all, I'm not

37:32.990 --> 37:33.990
entirely sure he should just

37:33.990 --> 37:34.990
be a pawn after this

37:34.990 --> 37:35.950
conversation?

37:35.950 --> 37:35.990
Really?

37:35.991 --> 37:36.990
Yeah.

37:36.990 --> 37:36.991
Really?

37:36.991 --> 37:37.990
Yes, really.

37:37.990 --> 37:38.990
Why?

37:38.991 --> 37:41.989
No, he's like, okay, like

37:41.990 --> 37:43.989
the first of all he said is

37:43.990 --> 37:44.990
she putting me up.

37:44.991 --> 37:46.989
And I was like I don't know.

37:46.990 --> 37:47.990
What?

37:47.990 --> 37:47.991
What?

37:47.991 --> 37:50.989
And then he goes he has

37:50.990 --> 37:51.990
an attitude.

37:51.991 --> 37:53.989
I'm trying to nice to him

37:53.990 --> 37:54.990
and he's giving me attitude

37:54.990 --> 37:55.990
this is what he says that

37:55.991 --> 37:57.989
really p, sses me off.

37:57.990 --> 38:03.989
He says and I was like....

38:03.990 --> 38:05.999
Whoa.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.409
Hey.

38:07.410 --> 38:10.119
Hey, can I finish talking

38:10.120 --> 38:12.989
privately.

38:12.990 --> 38:13.120
Okay.

38:13.120 --> 38:14.120
Okay.

38:14.120 --> 38:14.990
Dow mind.

38:14.990 --> 38:15.990
Because we were just

38:15.990 --> 38:15.991
talking.

38:15.991 --> 38:17.989
It just looks fishy.

38:17.990 --> 38:18.000
Who?

38:18.001 --> 38:19.000
You and me.

38:19.000 --> 38:19.990
What do you mean.

38:19.990 --> 38:20.990
Like we were just talking

38:20.991 --> 38:23.989
and then you came up here.

38:23.990 --> 38:23.991
Yeah.

38:23.991 --> 38:24.990
We're okay.

38:24.991 --> 38:26.989
Yeah, we're fine.

38:26.990 --> 38:27.990
Okay.

38:27.990 --> 38:27.991
Cool.

38:27.991 --> 38:35.991
I am just worried.

38:36.410 --> 38:37.989
Okay.

38:37.990 --> 38:40.949
Dude.

38:40.950 --> 38:41.989
Like it just looks fishy it

38:41.990 --> 38:42.990
is fishy.

38:42.991 --> 38:44.989
Now go.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.989
How weird is that.

38:47.990 --> 38:48.990
Okay.

38:48.990 --> 38:49.120
He's so weird.

38:49.121 --> 38:50.989
After what Becky said,

38:50.990 --> 38:52.989
I'm just a little suspect of

38:52.990 --> 38:52.991
Vanessa.

38:52.991 --> 38:54.539
And I don't know what to

38:54.540 --> 38:55.699
believe any more.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.989
Like what if he's crazy.

38:58.990 --> 39:00.409
He's playing this dumb

39:00.410 --> 39:01.989
card, like I had no idea.

39:01.990 --> 39:03.989
You are a doctor, you know

39:03.990 --> 39:05.990
what the.... is going on.

39:14.990 --> 39:15.990
My responsibility as the

39:16.000 --> 39:17.989
head of household is to

39:17.990 --> 39:19.289
nominate two people for

39:19.290 --> 39:22.989
eviction.

39:22.990 --> 39:23.990
It's always scary going

39:23.991 --> 39:26.989
into a nomination ceremony.

39:26.990 --> 39:27.990
Especially this time with

39:27.991 --> 39:29.989
Jackie walking out the door.

39:29.990 --> 39:30.990
I'm not sure where the house

39:30.991 --> 39:34.989
is going to lie this week so

39:34.990 --> 39:35.990
we shall see.

39:35.991 --> 39:43.989
Fingers crossed.

39:43.990 --> 39:45.989
I looked at every fact

39:45.990 --> 39:47.289
and detail about Vanessa and

39:47.290 --> 39:47.990
why she can't be trustedment

39:47.991 --> 39:49.989
I showed that to Liz and am

39:49.990 --> 39:50.990
hoping that is what will

39:50.991 --> 39:54.989
keep me safe this week.

39:54.990 --> 39:56.989
It's not looking good.

39:56.990 --> 39:58.989
Vanessa brought up the hoh

39:58.990 --> 40:00.989
trying to throw me under the

40:00.990 --> 40:02.989
busing get on me on the

40:02.990 --> 40:03.990
blockment if she wants to go

40:03.991 --> 40:04.999
after me this week, it is

40:05.000 --> 40:10.989
going to seal my fate.

40:10.990 --> 40:12.989
I'm going to base my

40:12.990 --> 40:14.989
nominations on people that I

40:14.990 --> 40:16.699
have previous loyalties in

40:16.700 --> 40:17.949
this house with and who I

40:17.950 --> 40:18.989
think is the biggest threat

40:18.990 --> 40:26.990
to mine and my sister's game.

40:34.290 --> 40:35.989
Guys, it's time for an

40:35.990 --> 40:43.990
elimination ceremony.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.989
This is the nomination

40:54.990 --> 40:54.991
ceremony.

40:54.991 --> 40:56.989
It is my responsibility as

40:56.990 --> 40:57.999
the head of household to

40:58.000 --> 40:59.409
nominate two house guests

40:59.410 --> 41:01.989
for eviction.

41:01.990 --> 41:03.989
I will turn two keys to lock

41:03.990 --> 41:04.990
in my nominations.

41:04.990 --> 41:05.990
And their faces will appear

41:05.991 --> 41:07.989
on the memory wall.

41:07.990 --> 41:09.409
First house guest I'm

41:09.410 --> 41:17.410
nominated is: The next house

41:19.990 --> 41:27.990
guest I have nominated is: I

41:34.990 --> 41:36.989
have nominated you, Becky

41:36.990 --> 41:39.289
and you Johnnie mack.

41:39.290 --> 41:41.989
Johnnie mack, are you a veto

41:41.989 --> 41:42.989
You have three of them under

41:42.990 --> 41:43.990
your belt and you have come

41:43.991 --> 41:44.999
so close to winning all

41:45.000 --> 41:46.699
these hohs.

41:46.700 --> 41:47.989
So I have to keep that in

41:47.990 --> 41:48.990
mind.

41:48.990 --> 41:49.990
Becky, you are like an

41:49.990 --> 41:50.990
undercover superwoman.

41:50.990 --> 41:51.990
Are you great at everything

41:51.991 --> 41:56.989
that you do.

41:56.990 --> 41:56.991
Sorry.

41:56.991 --> 41:58.699
This is hard.

41:58.700 --> 42:00.989
So with that said, I wish

42:00.990 --> 42:01.990
you both the best of luck in

42:01.991 --> 42:03.989
the veto competition and

42:03.990 --> 42:05.989
this nomination ceremony is

42:05.990 --> 42:11.989
adjourned.

42:11.990 --> 42:12.990
It's not sur prising to

42:12.991 --> 42:14.989
go from hoh to on the block.

42:14.990 --> 42:16.989
I'm a little nervous at

42:16.990 --> 42:18.829
where I'm at in the game and

42:18.830 --> 42:19.989
if Vanessa will influence

42:19.990 --> 42:21.539
them to send me home this

42:21.540 --> 42:22.989
week.

42:22.990 --> 42:23.990
Johnnie is a potential

42:23.990 --> 42:24.290
backup target this week.

42:24.291 --> 42:25.989
And he's completely doing it

42:25.990 --> 42:26.950
to himself.

42:26.951 --> 42:28.989
It's like watching a slow

42:28.990 --> 42:31.989
train wreck.

42:31.990 --> 42:32.990
I'm not surprised about

42:32.990 --> 42:33.950
being nominated.

42:33.951 --> 42:34.989
If I do pull this off and I

42:34.990 --> 42:36.409
come down off that block,

42:36.410 --> 42:37.539
Vanessa, you better watch

42:37.540 --> 42:38.989
out because I'm coming after

42:38.990 --> 42:43.289
you next week.

42:43.290 --> 42:44.989
I've gotten a lot of

42:44.990 --> 42:44.991
critical information this

42:44.991 --> 42:46.409
week with my nominations.

42:46.410 --> 42:47.989
I'm not even sure who is the

42:47.990 --> 42:48.990
pawn and who is the target.

42:48.991 --> 42:50.989
But there is still a lot of

42:50.990 --> 42:52.989
time for me to process my

42:52.990 --> 42:54.289
decision and anything could

42:54.290 --> 42:56.829
flip after veto.

42:56.830 --> 42:57.989
You will win the power of

42:57.990 --> 42:59.989
veto and will it be used to

42:59.990 --> 43:00.990
save either Becky or John

43:00.990 --> 43:01.990
from eviction?
