00:07.022 --> 00:08.473
Previously on E.R.

00:08.474 --> 00:12.237
I won't have a fair shot at this internship
unless he rewrites my recommendation.

00:12.238 --> 00:14.252
You're a most
impressive candidate.

00:14.253 --> 00:16.509
But we have
many impressive candidates.

00:16.610 --> 00:18.554
But going up
against a guy like Vucelich...

00:18.847 --> 00:22.774
- You don't think I should pursue it?
- If you're wrong, your career's over.

00:22.775 --> 00:25.372
When you first got here,
we were a little concerned about you.

00:25.573 --> 00:28.287
You seemed to care too much.
What happened to you, Carter?

00:28.288 --> 00:30.873
Your friend is lying up there
waiting for you.

00:30.874 --> 00:34.331
And if you don't go, you're gonna
regret this for the rest of your life.

00:34.432 --> 00:37.217
Is Dr. Lewis around?
I'm her sister, Chloe.

00:37.906 --> 00:40.842

01:10.277 --> 01:14.196
Good morning. How's the biker life?

01:15.447 --> 01:17.782
Jerry, I feel like a Hell's Angel.

01:17.947 --> 01:19.449
I hate to break it to you, Dr. G...

01:19.616 --> 01:22.159
...but an Angel wouldn't
be caught dead on a rice burner.

01:22.325 --> 01:24.743
Goat's coming in nice.
What's it been, a couple days?

01:24.910 --> 01:26.952
A week.

01:27.119 --> 01:29.496
Some guys need more time.

01:33.748 --> 01:37.209
Mark, we're short-staffed.
Malik and Wendy are out sick.

01:37.374 --> 01:41.044
Call the nurses temp agency
and get some per diems to fill in.

01:41.211 --> 01:44.045
- Are you wearing contacts?
- I thought I'd try them out.

01:44.212 --> 01:46.546
- Well, why the big makeover?
- No reason.

01:46.713 --> 01:49.840
- Hey, fuzzy, we still on for The Mint?
- Yeah.

01:50.007 --> 01:51.799
- Jazz club.
- Meat market.

01:51.966 --> 01:53.133
Hot date?

01:53.300 --> 01:55.217
Just a couple of single guys
hanging out.

01:55.384 --> 01:57.802
So we'll leave around 8:00
for a 9:00 set?

01:57.969 --> 02:00.137
- I'm not doing anything tonight.
- Really, Jerry?

02:00.304 --> 02:03.972
Good, because there's
a great game on TV.

02:07.016 --> 02:10.559
- Have you seen this month's Journal?
- No.

02:11.477 --> 02:14.061
Vucelich published his study.

02:15.228 --> 02:18.314
It's tough your name
couldn't be on it.

02:18.481 --> 02:20.315
I wouldn't want my name to be on it.

02:20.481 --> 02:22.982
The whole study is a sham.

02:23.149 --> 02:26.693
Sour grapes is one thing, Peter,
but to slander a colleague is offensive-

02:26.860 --> 02:29.569
Look, it's not slander. It's the truth.

02:30.445 --> 02:35.281
Are you prepared to back that up?
Take it to the Ethics Committee?

02:36.406 --> 02:40.159
Well, then keep your mouth shut.

02:46.953 --> 02:50.414
Do you think it was the ham and eggs?
Because I had two helpings.

02:50.581 --> 02:54.332
Thanks for the concern,
but I don't think it was my breakfast.

02:54.499 --> 02:59.252
It's the match. My entire future's
stuffed in an envelope.

02:59.419 --> 03:01.420
I know I'm not gonna get in here.

03:01.587 --> 03:02.837
Well, I hope you do.

03:03.004 --> 03:06.131
Because if not, I'm gonna have to
start looking for a new boyfriend.

03:06.297 --> 03:07.840
Better start looking.

03:08.007 --> 03:11.216
They hand out the envelopes
at 9 sharp. What time is it?

03:11.383 --> 03:13.634
15.
- Oh, God!

03:16.636 --> 03:18.387
Hey.

03:19.846 --> 03:22.472
- Thanks for coming.
- I've got five minutes.

03:22.639 --> 03:24.682
- You didn't bring her.
- No.

03:24.849 --> 03:26.808
- Hi. What can I get you?
- Nothing.

03:27.475 --> 03:29.393
Okay.

03:33.311 --> 03:36.438
I don't blame you for hating me.

03:36.604 --> 03:40.732
When I left last year
I was so screwed up.

03:40.898 --> 03:44.317
I was either gonna kill myself
or turn it around.

03:45.776 --> 03:49.486
What kept me going
was thinking about Susie.

03:50.487 --> 03:52.738
Yeah, right.

03:52.905 --> 03:56.865
It's different this time. I...

03:57.032 --> 04:00.617
I got into a program,
and I've been clean for five months.

04:00.784 --> 04:03.577
- I bet.
- And I got engaged.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.704
He's a great guy, Susan.

04:09.580 --> 04:10.832
Congratulations.

04:11.581 --> 04:14.166
I have to get to work.
What is it you wanted?

04:21.003 --> 04:23.046
I want to be a mother to my daughter.

04:28.299 --> 04:31.884
Well, that's too damn bad,
because you abandoned your child.

04:32.051 --> 04:34.511
And that's the best thing
that ever happened to her.

04:37.387 --> 04:39.429
Susie, wait!

04:39.596 --> 04:42.640
Susie, please. Come on,
you can't keep her away from me.

04:42.807 --> 04:44.516
She's my baby!

05:43.923 --> 05:45.757
- Don't say a word.
- About what?

05:45.924 --> 05:48.758
- The temp agency makes us wear them.
- You're the temp?

05:48.924 --> 05:52.052
Well, they cut my hours in half,
and I have a mortgage to pay.

05:52.218 --> 05:53.552
So what am I supposed to do?

05:53.719 --> 05:57.221
- What, the earthworms didn't pan out?
- They croaked.

05:59.014 --> 06:00.431
What's this?

06:00.598 --> 06:04.016
Oh, Jeanie was made
employee of the month.

06:04.183 --> 06:05.809
Does anyone have an aspirin?

06:05.975 --> 06:08.310
Carol, can you start
a Foley on the guy in 3?

06:08.477 --> 06:12.354
I'm on in two minutes.
Ask the employee of the month.

06:15.397 --> 06:17.273
- You know what she looks like?
- Yes.

06:17.440 --> 06:19.566
- And the other workers?
- We all know Chloe.

06:19.733 --> 06:21.067
You know, if she comes here-

06:21.233 --> 06:23.735
If she's peeking in that window,
I want you to page me.

06:23.902 --> 06:25.153
Of course.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.820
I'm afraid my sister
might try something crazy.

06:27.987 --> 06:30.822
- Security's right down the hall.
- I'll talk to them.

06:30.989 --> 06:32.239
I already have.

06:33.991 --> 06:38.909
- Yeah, but she still might-
- We're covered, Susan. Go to work.

06:40.161 --> 06:41.578
Yeah.

06:41.911 --> 06:43.746
Bye.

06:43.912 --> 06:45.746
- Come here. Come here.
- Bye, cutie.

06:45.913 --> 06:48.498
Yeah. Say goodbye. Say goodbye.

06:48.665 --> 06:50.833
Wave bye-bye to Mommy. Bye-bye.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.750
Bye-bye.

06:52.917 --> 06:54.668
That's right.

06:54.835 --> 06:56.544
That's right, honey.

06:56.711 --> 06:58.086
Come on.

06:58.336 --> 07:00.671
Are you on any medications,
Mr. Bartoli?

07:00.838 --> 07:04.673
I can't understand it.
I was feeling like a million bucks.

07:04.840 --> 07:08.175
I was in the sack, actually,
with this knockout postmistress.

07:08.342 --> 07:11.302
It's amazing how well you can do
hanging around the post office.

07:11.468 --> 07:15.179
And then, bam. Right in the chest.

07:15.345 --> 07:17.555
Any medications, Mr. Bartoli?

07:17.722 --> 07:23.434
Well, I got this ointment
from one of those catalogs...

07:23.600 --> 07:28.853
- Dr. Joe's Prolonging Cream?
- Keeps me going all night.

07:29.019 --> 07:32.272
- How much did you use?
- The whole tube.

07:32.438 --> 07:36.315
But Mr. Bartoli, this has digitalis.
It can cause a heart arrhythmia.

07:36.858 --> 07:38.608
You gotta stop using it.

07:38.775 --> 07:40.317
- Cold turkey?
- Yeah.

07:42.610 --> 07:45.404
Doesn't this stuff make you
completely numb?

07:45.570 --> 07:46.946
An unfortunate side effect.

07:47.321 --> 07:52.323
Nevertheless, it helps
guys like us make the grade.

07:52.490 --> 07:54.616
- Guys like us?
- Bald guys.

07:56.076 --> 07:59.619
Babes know we have more testosterone.

07:59.786 --> 08:01.286
They expect more.

08:01.453 --> 08:03.121
Am I right?

08:13.460 --> 08:15.253
Oh, no.

08:16.044 --> 08:19.338
- Bad news?
- No news. Hicks is late.

08:19.505 --> 08:23.090
- Should I grab an emesis basin?
- No, I'm all right.

08:23.257 --> 08:26.592
- I've resigned myself to the painful truth.
- What are you talking about?

08:26.758 --> 08:30.135
I don't deserve to match here.
I don't.

08:30.302 --> 08:32.428
I've been so wrapped up
in the competition...

08:32.595 --> 08:34.846
...that I've lost sight
of what it's all about.

08:35.013 --> 08:39.972
I've become this brownnosing,
procedure whore...

08:40.140 --> 08:41.933
...treating patients like guinea pigs.

08:42.100 --> 08:44.851
I've been dishonest,
I've been arrogant, I've been-

08:45.018 --> 08:47.686
- Jump in if you disagree.
- No, you've been a real schmuck.

08:47.853 --> 08:49.479
I know.

08:50.813 --> 08:55.148
But no more.
From now on, the patients come first.

08:55.315 --> 08:58.150
Trauma coming. Grandfather
brought him to the main entrance.

08:58.317 --> 09:00.985
- Paramedics are bringing in two more.
- What happened?

09:01.152 --> 09:03.153
On our way to school,
guy ran a red light.

09:03.320 --> 09:04.862
- Where does it hurt?
- My leg.

09:05.029 --> 09:07.197
- Will he be okay?
- Dr. Benton's the best.

09:07.364 --> 09:09.448
- What can I do?
- Check Mr. Bowman's vitals.

09:09.615 --> 09:11.574
I'm fine. I wanna stay with my grandson.

09:11.741 --> 09:14.909
No, look, we have to check you out.
It's okay. Carter, check him.

09:15.076 --> 09:17.911
Would you come with me,
Mr. Bowman?

09:18.911 --> 09:22.413
It's okay.
We'll take good care of him.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.540
Freddie Robinson, 19. Jackass.

09:26.707 --> 09:29.958
Took out three cars at Racine and Polk.
One fatality on the scene.

09:30.125 --> 09:32.335
Pumped him with
two liters of saline in the field.

09:32.502 --> 09:35.378
- Vitals?
- BP, 140, resp, 22.

09:35.545 --> 09:39.047
24! BP's 140/100. Pulse is 90.

09:39.213 --> 09:40.839
It hurts.

09:41.006 --> 09:43.341
- Any meds?
- Found some in the car. You got them?

09:43.507 --> 09:47.051
- I left them in the rig.
- Well, why don't you go get them.

09:47.968 --> 09:50.345
- New guy, huh?
- I'm a baby-sitter, not a fireman.

09:50.511 --> 09:51.887
I'm gonna die!

09:52.054 --> 09:54.263
One, two, three.

09:55.264 --> 09:56.848
I'll get him.

09:57.015 --> 09:58.974
Let's get that O-neg down here.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.310
You're not letting me finish
my examination.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.978
I'm going to see my grandson.

10:06.145 --> 10:09.688
- Hey, Lydia, need any help?
- Sure. Take Mr. Phelps to the bathroom.

10:09.855 --> 10:12.607
- And check the boards.
- My pleasure. Hi, I'm John Carter.

10:13.023 --> 10:15.025
All right, let's get his clothes off.

10:15.190 --> 10:18.151
- Where is everybody?
- Short-handed, just us. Start cutting.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.986
It's hard to do my job
when I have to do everybody else's.

10:21.153 --> 10:23.862
So you have noticed
that we do something around here?

10:24.029 --> 10:26.030
- How is he?
- Did Carter check you out?

10:26.196 --> 10:28.364
- I'm fine. How's my boy?
- I'm okay, Grandpa.

10:28.531 --> 10:30.365
Sir, could you wait outside for us?

10:30.532 --> 10:32.575
- I'm staying with my grandson.
- It's okay.

10:32.742 --> 10:35.910
- How you doing, buddy?
- My leg hurts so bad.

10:36.077 --> 10:38.537
We'll get you something
as soon as we can.

10:38.704 --> 10:42.038
Hurt that same knee
four months ago playing basketball.

10:42.205 --> 10:44.039
Jeanie, call up his old chart.

10:44.206 --> 10:46.708
- C-spine, chest and AP pelvis?
- That's right.

10:46.875 --> 10:50.209
Add a femur film. He's got
a fracture. Soft-tissue swelling.

10:50.376 --> 10:52.377
He's got a big ecchymosis
of the left thigh.

10:52.544 --> 10:55.504
I don't feel a fracture,
but you're right, it could be broken.

10:55.671 --> 10:58.256
Doug, need your help.

10:58.422 --> 11:02.049
Let's give him Toradol
after we clear the C-spine.

11:02.966 --> 11:05.592
Barry Meeks, 8 years old.
Restrained in the back seat.

11:05.759 --> 11:08.219
Car was T-boned,
used the Jaws of Life to cut him out.

11:08.386 --> 11:11.304
BP's 60 palp.
Difficult airway, can't get a line.

11:11.470 --> 11:14.180
- I'll do a saphenous cutdown.
- He's bradycardic, 40.

11:14.347 --> 11:16.348
.5 atropine.
Get that O-neg down here!

11:16.515 --> 11:20.017
- What's happening?
- Nicole, take her to the waiting room.

11:20.183 --> 11:22.643
- Abdomen's rigid.
- Could be a ruptured spleen.

11:22.810 --> 11:25.728
Cutdown tray,
number 15 blade and a Kelly, please.

11:26.479 --> 11:29.939
- I need a cutdown tray.
- Check next door.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.940
- It hurts!
- Hold still. Hold still!

11:32.107 --> 11:33.566
What are you doing?

11:33.732 --> 11:35.775
- Was he T-boned?
- He's the T-boner.

11:35.942 --> 11:39.236
Ran a red, decapitated a pedestrian
and smashed up our other customers.

11:39.403 --> 11:41.195
Yeah, a real prince.

11:41.362 --> 11:43.822
We'll take him to the O.R.
when he has a central line.

11:43.988 --> 11:46.447
- Heart rate's up to 130.
- It hurts!

11:46.614 --> 11:49.741
- Are you on any drugs?
- No, I'm clean.

11:49.908 --> 11:52.451
- Track marks on the left arm.
- Here too.

11:52.617 --> 11:54.202
I'm clean. I swear.

11:54.369 --> 11:58.037
Yeah, right.
Give him Narcan, 2 mgs, IV push.

11:58.413 --> 12:03.373
I'll try a straight blade.
Give me cricoid pressure.

12:03.540 --> 12:05.833
- How are you doing, Doug?
- Almost there.

12:05.999 --> 12:09.001
Give me an O-silk tie
and a 14-gauge angiocath.

12:09.168 --> 12:10.669
Here you go.

12:10.835 --> 12:13.087
- Are you in?
- Yes.

12:13.379 --> 12:16.380
- I'll bag him.
- Mark, guy's crashing in 2.

12:16.546 --> 12:18.090
- Doug, you okay?
- Yeah.

12:18.965 --> 12:23.759
Dropped his pressure.
Just tubed him. Pumping in the O-neg.

12:23.926 --> 12:25.635
- How's it going?
- Swell.

12:25.802 --> 12:28.970
First coffee with Chloe,
now chest trauma with Freddie.

12:29.137 --> 12:32.597
- Sounds like a nice way to start the day.
- Oh, yeah.

12:32.764 --> 12:35.557
- I don't feel a pulse.
- These chest films just came.

12:36.849 --> 12:39.643
- Damn. Widened mediastinum.
- Probably ruptured his aorta.

12:41.185 --> 12:43.269
10 blade.

12:43.436 --> 12:46.938
The labs came back.
Coked up, blood alcohol. 322.

12:47.104 --> 12:51.732
- Rib spreader.
- Freddie had a party. Maybe his last.

12:51.899 --> 12:55.318
- Suction.
- Man, that's a lot of blood.

12:55.984 --> 12:58.861
Okay, I've got the aorta. Clamp.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.571
Two more units O-neg.

13:04.656 --> 13:06.448
- Got it?
- Yeah.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.949
Nice work, Susan.

13:09.116 --> 13:12.243
Great. I just saved the life of a murderer.

13:14.952 --> 13:17.788
And take a deep breath.

13:17.954 --> 13:21.207
You know what? I've had enough
of this. I got a deposition.

13:21.372 --> 13:24.333
I still hear wheezes.
I'd like to take a full history.

13:24.500 --> 13:28.126
Well, okay, but if you can do it in the
time it takes me to get dressed...

13:28.293 --> 13:29.544
...you can be my guest.

13:29.711 --> 13:31.712
- Does asthma run in your family?
- No.

13:31.879 --> 13:35.839
Have you ever had any other symptoms?
Coughing, difficulty breathing, fatigue-?

13:36.006 --> 13:39.674
Yeah, fatigue, but I've been up
for two days preparing for this brief.

13:39.841 --> 13:41.467
I'm concerned about these attacks.

13:41.759 --> 13:47.511
Look, I am up for partner.
One screwup now, I'm finished.

13:47.678 --> 13:50.263
You're here now.
Let me run a couple quick tests...

13:50.430 --> 13:53.390
...so you don't have to come back, huh?

13:53.557 --> 13:56.975
- How long?
-45 minutes.

13:57.142 --> 13:59.477
I wouldn't feel right about
letting you walk out.

13:59.643 --> 14:02.270
Okay, well, make it snappy, okay?

14:02.978 --> 14:06.647
- Lucky the Bowman kid came in.
- Why, what's he got?

14:06.814 --> 14:08.023
No fracture.

14:08.190 --> 14:11.190
- What's that?
- Looks like an osteosarcoma.

14:11.357 --> 14:14.651
- You have his old chart and films?
- Yeah, here.

14:18.445 --> 14:20.988
- There it is.
- What?

14:21.155 --> 14:24.239
- The beginnings of a tumor.
- No mention of it in his chart.

14:24.406 --> 14:26.657
- When was he brought in here?
- November 20th.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.492
No, they should have caught this.
Who was the doctor?

14:29.659 --> 14:32.286
Doug Ross.

14:36.329 --> 14:38.998
There it is, periosteal reaction.
He missed it.

14:39.165 --> 14:41.332
Couple of millimeters, easy to miss.

14:41.498 --> 14:45.501
- We both see it.
- Today's x-ray tells us where to look.

14:45.668 --> 14:48.335
But you can't change the fact
that he misdiagnosed the kid.

14:48.502 --> 14:50.503
I'll talk to Doug.
Have you told the family?

14:50.670 --> 14:54.339
- No, not yet.
- Good. Don't. I'll take it from here.

14:56.173 --> 14:59.383
- John Carter?
- In the drug lockup.

15:10.347 --> 15:12.014
I'm in! I'm in. I'm in.

15:12.181 --> 15:14.182
- I knew you'd make it.
- Yes!

15:14.349 --> 15:16.725
- Are you off? Come with me.
- But you're not off.

15:16.892 --> 15:18.144
We're gonna celebrate.

15:18.309 --> 15:21.103
I got one more patient,
and then I can take lunch.

15:21.270 --> 15:23.479
- Where did you match, Carter?
- Here.

15:23.646 --> 15:26.273
Labs on your asthma guy.

15:27.565 --> 15:28.857
- Damn.
- Bad?

15:29.024 --> 15:32.109
No, he's just gonna need more tests.
I should do a blood smear.

15:32.276 --> 15:34.527
I'll turf him to Hematology.
Give me five minutes.

15:34.694 --> 15:36.486
Coming through!

15:36.653 --> 15:39.905
Coming through.
Look out, we're coming through.

15:40.905 --> 15:44.199
- Hugo's back for spring-cleaning.
- Oh, man.

15:44.365 --> 15:46.908
Sores are infected.
Carol, I think it's your turn.

15:47.075 --> 15:48.784
I took the crazy rabbit guy. Haleh.

15:48.992 --> 15:51.702
I took the guy
with the maggots last week.

15:51.869 --> 15:56.205
- Don't look at me.
- Girls, there's plenty of me to go around.

15:56.372 --> 15:59.623
There's only one way to settle this.
Ready?

16:00.123 --> 16:01.874
One, two, three.

16:03.501 --> 16:06.252
Best out of three. Come on, guys.

16:06.418 --> 16:08.586
Hey, Jeanie.
Hugo needs to be cleaned up...

16:08.753 --> 16:10.879
...and we're really busy here.
Can you do it?

16:11.046 --> 16:14.548
No. That's a nurse's job.

16:18.926 --> 16:21.718
- My mother was a nurse.
- Great. That's great.

16:23.552 --> 16:25.388
- Dr. Lewis.
- Yes.

16:25.553 --> 16:27.597
- Can you talk to that lady?
- Who is she?

16:27.763 --> 16:30.598
The mother of the junkie
that ran the red light.

16:30.765 --> 16:34.558
Ma'am? I'm Dr. Lewis.

16:34.725 --> 16:36.768
- You worked on my son?
- Yes, I did.

16:37.477 --> 16:40.895
They told me you saved his life.
Thank you.

16:41.062 --> 16:45.397
- Did they tell you what happened?
- Yeah, some idiot crashed into him.

16:45.564 --> 16:48.107
No, he ran a red light.
There were eyewitnesses.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.734
He was under the influence
of alcohol and cocaine.

16:50.901 --> 16:54.653
- My son doesn't use drugs.
- Tell it to the police.

16:55.236 --> 16:58.321
- Police?
- Yeah. His tox screen was positive.

16:58.488 --> 17:01.323
- You reported him?
- It's required by the law.

17:01.490 --> 17:02.823
The test was wrong.

17:02.990 --> 17:05.157
You're son was drunk,
coked out of his mind.

17:05.325 --> 17:09.410
Got behind the wheel, put three
people in hospital and killed a girl.

17:22.541 --> 17:26.086
Dad, did you hear
what I said? Dad?

17:26.252 --> 17:29.838
I'm losing you. I'm losing you.
Can you hear me?

17:30.005 --> 17:35.215
You gotta call me when you dock, okay?

17:36.842 --> 17:40.469
A hematologist is gonna be down.
He's gonna wanna run some more tests.

17:40.635 --> 17:44.012
- A hematologist? What is that?
- It's a blood doctor.

17:44.179 --> 17:45.513
Why do I have to see him?

17:45.679 --> 17:48.765
You are severely anemic,
and we need to find out why.

17:48.931 --> 17:50.432
I'm not understanding you.

17:50.599 --> 17:53.934
Dr. Berenson is gonna explain it all
to you when he gets here.

17:54.601 --> 17:58.603
- What is the treatment for anemia?
- I couldn't tell you without more tests.

17:58.769 --> 18:01.062
Hold on a second. How serious is this?

18:01.354 --> 18:02.856
I wouldn't even hazard a guess.

18:03.022 --> 18:05.982
Dr. Berenson is gonna explain all this
to you when he gets here.

18:06.149 --> 18:09.609
I've got another patient. Excuse me.

18:11.319 --> 18:12.652
- All set?
- Where are we going?

18:12.819 --> 18:14.611
Surprise.

18:16.362 --> 18:19.865
- He came in for a sore knee.
- Anyone could have missed that.

18:20.032 --> 18:21.782
He could lose his leg.

18:21.949 --> 18:23.950
Dr. Greene, Dr. Ross.

18:24.117 --> 18:27.452
Kathy Snyder, hospital counsel.
I asked her to come down.

18:27.618 --> 18:29.870
I guess I'm looking at
my first malpractice suit.

18:30.036 --> 18:33.413
Not necessarily. It's my understanding
that the patient and his family...

18:33.580 --> 18:36.540
...are unaware that the tumor
was visible on the earlier x-ray.

18:36.707 --> 18:39.208
There's no legal obligation
to make them aware of it.

18:40.625 --> 18:42.960
- So we don't say anything?
- What good will it do?

18:43.127 --> 18:46.295
- Will it change the treatment?
- No.

18:46.461 --> 18:48.380
You comfortable with that?

18:48.546 --> 18:50.423
I don't see any advantage
in telling them.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.590
There is none.

18:56.426 --> 18:59.094
- So where's the kid?
- He's been moved to Exam 4.

18:59.260 --> 19:00.845
His grandfather
know about the cancer?

19:01.012 --> 19:02.512
- I haven't told him.
- I'll do it.

19:02.679 --> 19:05.264
Not a good idea.
You should disengage from the case.

19:05.431 --> 19:09.391
- Kathy's right, Doug. I'll handle it.
- My case, my responsibility.

19:26.483 --> 19:28.359
Raise your arms, Hugo.

19:34.195 --> 19:36.780
Oh, man. Use a lot of soap down there.

19:38.322 --> 19:40.949
- I'm a mess.
- Yes, you are. Scrub really hard.

19:42.283 --> 19:44.368
When you're done,
we'll get you clean clothes.

19:44.535 --> 19:48.829
- Can I keep my lucky shoes?
- If you use more shampoo.

19:49.453 --> 19:52.038
We need a nurse in 2.

19:55.415 --> 19:57.667
Oh, I am so sorry.

19:58.833 --> 20:01.293
- They need the beds changed.
- I'll be right there.

20:07.755 --> 20:10.090
Hey. I've been looking
everywhere for you.

20:10.256 --> 20:11.507
Yeah. I'm hiding out.

20:11.674 --> 20:13.299
- You want some juice?
- Sure.

20:13.466 --> 20:15.550
I hear you got in a slap fight
with a patient.

20:15.717 --> 20:17.468
And lost.

20:17.635 --> 20:20.220
Oh, man,
I just want this morning to end.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.845
What happened with Chloe?

20:22.012 --> 20:24.972
She wants to play Mommy again.
I called my lawyer and the police.

20:25.139 --> 20:28.016
- Police?
- Yeah. What if she tries to take her?

20:28.182 --> 20:29.934
I don't know, maybe I can buy her off.

20:30.100 --> 20:34.186
- Does she know you're adopting her?
- No, and I'm not gonna tell her.

20:34.353 --> 20:37.187
- Wait a minute.
- What?

20:37.854 --> 20:40.773
I thought your eyes were brown.

20:40.940 --> 20:44.024
For 15 extra bucks, they can be blue.

20:44.858 --> 20:46.943
Does it look dumb?

20:47.109 --> 20:49.944
No. I like blue eyes.

20:50.527 --> 20:52.737
Now what?

20:52.904 --> 20:56.739
Oh, my God! Call security to Daycare.

20:58.032 --> 21:01.366
Looking good, Hugo. We'll call you
a cab, they'll take you to a shelter.

21:01.533 --> 21:03.451
- What about my shoes?
- What about them?

21:03.618 --> 21:06.828
- I need some tape.
- Here.

21:06.995 --> 21:09.038
- Patient in 3 needs a nurse.
- I'm busy.

21:09.204 --> 21:10.538
Excuse me, any scissors?

21:10.705 --> 21:13.040
This particular patient
is puking his guts out.

21:13.207 --> 21:15.916
What do you want me to do?
Get him an emesis basin.

21:16.082 --> 21:18.417
- That's a nurse's job.
- Can you find another nurse?

21:18.584 --> 21:19.877
- They're all busy.
- What?

21:20.043 --> 21:24.545
- Excuse me, I cut my finger.
- Oh, Hugo, you're gonna need stitches.

21:24.712 --> 21:26.922
That's a P.A. job.

21:29.256 --> 21:32.717
Jeanie, Hugo. Hugo, Jeanie.

21:35.384 --> 21:37.094
Watch it, watch it.

21:37.261 --> 21:40.345
Sir. Sir, please, I need your help.
Come on.

21:49.058 --> 21:50.809
- Where's Susie?
- Calm down-

21:50.976 --> 21:52.810
Don't tell me to calm down!
Where is she?

21:52.977 --> 21:55.020
She's taking her first steps.

21:57.104 --> 21:59.898
I didn't want you to miss it.

22:00.899 --> 22:05.151
Oh, yeah. Susie.

22:05.318 --> 22:07.444
Yeah.

22:07.611 --> 22:11.070
Oh, yes. Oh, yeah.

22:12.779 --> 22:15.656
That's my girl.

22:15.823 --> 22:19.408
Oh, yeah, that's my big girl.

22:23.702 --> 22:27.163
Mr. Bowman?
Can I see you out here, please?

22:31.914 --> 22:33.416
Dr. Ross, right?

22:33.583 --> 22:36.333
You're the same one who took
care of Brett a few months ago.

22:36.500 --> 22:37.751
That's right. Yes, sir.

22:37.918 --> 22:40.752
- I'm afraid that the news isn't good.
- His leg is broken?

22:40.919 --> 22:43.921
No, his injury alerted us
to a much more serious problem.

22:44.088 --> 22:49.549
He has an osteosarcoma. It's a
bone tumor in his leg, above his knee.

22:49.716 --> 22:52.384
- A tumor?
- It's a form of cancer.

23:05.558 --> 23:09.685
- How bad is it?
- Well, we need to determine that.

23:09.852 --> 23:12.061
There's an oncologist
on his way down here.

23:12.228 --> 23:14.937
He's a friend of mine.
He's one of the best in the country.

23:15.104 --> 23:18.147
And he's had great success
with these kinds of cases.

23:27.194 --> 23:29.946
My boy has cancer.

23:51.873 --> 23:53.542
Mr. Bowman.

23:55.334 --> 23:59.711
Hi. Did Dr. Greene talk to you?

23:59.878 --> 24:01.337
No, Dr. Ross.

24:01.712 --> 24:06.715
Oh. So he explained the situation?

24:06.881 --> 24:09.466
He did, but I don't understand.

24:09.633 --> 24:12.093
Brett was in here four months ago,
he was okay.

24:12.677 --> 24:15.511
This cropped up so fast.

24:15.677 --> 24:19.680
I'm sorry.
What exactly did Dr. Ross tell you?

24:19.846 --> 24:22.723
Well, my boy's got cancer.

24:26.017 --> 24:29.185
That is what we're
talking about, isn't it?

24:30.353 --> 24:32.229
Yeah, yeah.

24:32.562 --> 24:35.063
Excuse me.

24:41.816 --> 24:43.692
What's happening
with the Bowman case?

24:43.859 --> 24:47.236
Excuse us. Doug's handling it.

24:47.403 --> 24:51.405
I just talked to the grandfather. Doug
didn't tell him he missed the diagnosis.

24:51.572 --> 24:53.490
Hospital counsel advised against it.

24:53.656 --> 24:55.407
You're not gonna tell them the truth?

24:55.574 --> 24:58.909
It's not gonna change the diagnosis,
and we're under no legal obligation.

24:59.076 --> 25:02.369
- What about an ethical obligation?
- You weren't originally on the case.

25:02.536 --> 25:05.329
- And you're not on it now.
- They have a right to know.

25:05.621 --> 25:08.456
It's none of your business.
We made a decision. That's final.

25:09.915 --> 25:12.124
- Lucky the kid came in.
- Can you take him, Frank?

25:12.291 --> 25:15.335
I'd like to, they don't have insurance.
Are they friends of yours?

25:15.501 --> 25:17.002
No, they just need a break.

25:17.169 --> 25:19.003
Sorry, there's not much I can do.

25:19.170 --> 25:22.047
Okay, I guess I'm gonna have
to send my referrals elsewhere.

25:22.213 --> 25:23.839
It's not that I don't want to help.

25:24.006 --> 25:25.840
How about waving
your professional fee?

25:26.007 --> 25:27.924
I could,
but chemotherapy's expensive.

25:28.091 --> 25:31.593
- Ballpark, how much?
-12,000. That doesn't cover surgery.

25:31.760 --> 25:35.512
How about I give you 5000,
I work in your clinic on my days off.

25:35.678 --> 25:39.639
- If you do this for every patient-
- Would you do it? Would you do it?

25:39.806 --> 25:43.766
Okay. One day a week, four to five
months ought to just about cover it.

25:43.933 --> 25:45.934
Deal. Okay. Thanks.

25:46.684 --> 25:49.144
- Jerry, have you seen Susan?
- Not for a while.

25:49.311 --> 25:52.646
Hope nothing happened upstairs.
What's so funny?

25:52.813 --> 25:56.565
Right after Jeanie stitched up Hugo's
finger, he tripped on the way out.

25:56.732 --> 26:01.775
- Yeah?
- Now she's got to stitch up his head.

26:02.568 --> 26:06.278
- Susan, is everything all right?
- It's great.

26:06.445 --> 26:08.113
- What happened?
- It was amazing.

26:08.279 --> 26:10.613
- What?
- Susie took her first steps.

26:10.780 --> 26:13.198
Two little steps.

26:13.365 --> 26:15.742
You have crumbs.

26:16.284 --> 26:18.618
Hazards of the hirsute.

26:32.959 --> 26:35.294
- Dr. Benton.
- Yes.

26:35.460 --> 26:38.337
I want to thank you for everything
you've done for my grandson.

26:38.503 --> 26:41.422
We'll be leaving as soon as
we talk to the oncologist.

26:42.298 --> 26:43.798
Good luck.

26:45.048 --> 26:46.842
Thank you very much.

26:59.557 --> 27:00.807
Mr. Bowman.

27:06.519 --> 27:09.186
I think there's something
you should know.

27:10.604 --> 27:13.146
Just follow my finger.

27:13.313 --> 27:16.440
Okay. Yeah.

27:16.607 --> 27:19.401
Extraocular movements are intact.

27:19.567 --> 27:23.486
We were dollying in for a close-up,
and we hit a sandbag.

27:23.653 --> 27:25.696
Eyepiece smashed right into my eye.

27:25.862 --> 27:28.405
Oh, so you're a cameraman-? Woman?

27:28.571 --> 27:31.281
Director and producer of infomercials.

27:31.448 --> 27:33.449
You ever see
"30 Days to a Tighter Butt"?

27:34.617 --> 27:36.326
No. Missed that.

27:37.868 --> 27:40.620
Hey, can you raise your eyebrows?

27:40.787 --> 27:43.205
- Smile.
- Nice teeth.

27:44.664 --> 27:46.998
Cranial nerves are intact.

27:48.666 --> 27:50.500
You ever do any modeling?

27:50.667 --> 27:53.460
- Me? No.
- Been on camera?

27:53.669 --> 27:56.170
You made that teaching video
a few years back.

27:57.671 --> 28:01.172
Yeah, I'm the star of "How to Intubate. "

28:01.339 --> 28:05.591
So you do have on-camera experience.

28:06.258 --> 28:10.010
I need to just take
a quick look at the other side here.

28:14.429 --> 28:16.222
- Where in the hell is he?
- Who?

28:16.388 --> 28:19.432
- Who? The damn medical student.
- Carter.

28:19.599 --> 28:23.518
He's kept me waiting here for two hours.
Now, I would like my test results.

28:23.684 --> 28:26.852
Okay, please calm down.
I'll page Dr. Carter.

28:27.019 --> 28:31.396
Fax this to my office.
The number is on the top.

28:47.238 --> 28:48.822
Dr. Ross?

28:48.989 --> 28:51.365
Good news.
The oncologist can take care of Brett.

28:51.532 --> 28:55.367
You missed it and didn't have
the decency to tell us.

29:05.499 --> 29:08.541
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

29:08.708 --> 29:12.044
You're trying to cover your ass.

29:17.838 --> 29:21.048
At least let me set
the oncologist up with Brett.

29:21.214 --> 29:23.466
I don't want you near my boy.

29:44.394 --> 29:47.228
Hi. Sorry, I don't have anything
on me right now.

29:47.395 --> 29:49.313
Catch you later?

30:07.740 --> 30:09.782
Your CT looks normal.

30:10.199 --> 30:13.617
- Oh, is that my brain?
- Yes, it is.

30:13.784 --> 30:16.119
- How does it look?
- Perfect.

30:16.286 --> 30:18.203
So have you thought about my offer?

30:18.537 --> 30:20.913
Yes, and your project sounds intriguing.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.123
Well, we'll discuss it over dinner.

30:23.290 --> 30:26.416
- What do I have to do?
- Just be yourself.

30:26.583 --> 30:29.084
You'll be a spokesperson
for a new FDA-approved drug.

30:29.251 --> 30:32.419
- What sort of drug?
- A more potent version of minoxidil.

30:32.586 --> 30:34.379
- For high blood pressure?
- Yeah.

30:34.545 --> 30:38.673
But we're more interested in promoting it
for male-pattern baldness.

30:39.464 --> 30:41.674
I see.

30:41.841 --> 30:43.758
You know,
I thought I read somewhere...

30:43.925 --> 30:46.719
...that women find baldness
a sign of virility.

30:48.428 --> 30:50.262
Who told you that, some bald guy?

30:55.306 --> 30:58.933
- Hugo needs a ride back to the shelter.
- Call him a cab. Jerry's got vouchers.

30:59.100 --> 31:01.309
- That's a nurse's job.
- I'm on a break.

31:01.476 --> 31:04.770
Hugo will wait.
The nurse will be right with you.

31:08.230 --> 31:11.773
I wait here the whole damn day,
and all you can say is you're sorry?

31:11.940 --> 31:14.441
I have your tests.
I called in a hematologist to come.

31:14.608 --> 31:18.318
See, now that is exactly what the damn
medical student said three hours ago!

31:18.485 --> 31:21.362
- This had better be worse than anemia.
- I'm afraid it is.

31:21.529 --> 31:26.240
Mr. Ledbetter, your blood smear shows
evidence of acute myelogenous leukemia.

31:28.199 --> 31:30.450
What?

31:30.617 --> 31:32.827
We need to admit you to run more tests.

31:32.993 --> 31:34.661
Is there anyone I should call?

31:34.828 --> 31:39.455
Excuse me. Mr. Ledbetter,
your office just faxed this over.

31:51.795 --> 31:54.004
- To the future.
- To surgery.

31:54.171 --> 31:57.297
To my future in surgery!

32:02.300 --> 32:04.760
Do you realize that
you' re taking a bath...

32:04.927 --> 32:08.387
...with one of the most sought-after
Residents in the country?

32:08.553 --> 32:11.472
- I have goose bumps.
- So I see.

32:11.639 --> 32:15.057
- Is that you?
- Not me.

32:23.186 --> 32:25.520
Where is it?

32:27.313 --> 32:29.773
Ten-year-old, fell off
a balance beam, hit her neck.

32:29.981 --> 32:31.316
Throat's too swollen to tube her.

32:31.483 --> 32:32.775
- Vitals?
- Get them right.

32:32.942 --> 32:36.443
BP's 70/50.
Pulse thready at 180. Cyanotic.

32:36.610 --> 32:39.153
- How's the air exchange?
- Bad. She's hard to ventilate.

32:39.320 --> 32:41.172
Her IV's infiltrated!
I thought you got it.

32:41.207 --> 32:42.197
I did!

32:42.363 --> 32:44.781
Gonna need an airway. I'll tube her.

32:44.947 --> 32:46.324
What have we got?

32:48.366 --> 32:51.326
- One, two...
- Buckle my shoe and kiss my ass.

32:51.493 --> 32:53.161
Haleh, give me a trach kit.

32:53.327 --> 32:55.329
- Let the nurse do that.
- I can get it.

32:55.495 --> 32:59.289
- I said, let the nurse do it.
- Take your beef outside.

32:59.456 --> 33:02.498
- Why don't you go with them?
- I've done more of these.

33:02.665 --> 33:04.124
Sterile gloves, please.

33:05.209 --> 33:08.835
You hand him those sterile gloves and
you're both out of here. Give me that.

33:12.795 --> 33:15.005
Okay, you ready?

33:16.381 --> 33:20.175
Trach tube introduced. Bag her.

33:20.342 --> 33:22.676
- The family had a right to know.
- You're right.

33:22.843 --> 33:26.344
- You made a mistake.
- Why don't you just get out?

33:26.887 --> 33:30.680
Peter, Doug can handle this. Go on.

33:33.182 --> 33:35.558
Go on.

33:48.356 --> 33:50.774
Jerry.

33:50.941 --> 33:54.026
- I think I was paged.
- Indeed you were.

33:54.192 --> 33:58.862
Four times from Dr. Lewis, twice from
Dr. Hicks and twice from Hematology.

33:59.029 --> 34:03.531
And from Morgenstern,
a congratulatory basket of muffins.

34:04.698 --> 34:06.366
Dr. Morgenstern leave a note?

34:06.533 --> 34:09.492
- Carter! Where the hell have you been?
- Lunch.

34:09.659 --> 34:12.161
- For three hours?
- Long lunch.

34:12.327 --> 34:14.871
- You left Mr. Ledbetter waiting.
- I'll go see him now.

34:15.036 --> 34:17.414
Don't bother.
I admitted him upstairs with leukemia.

34:17.581 --> 34:19.873
Leukemia?
I didn't think it was that serious.

34:20.039 --> 34:21.456
Yeah. What are you, first year?

34:21.623 --> 34:24.375
He had low crit and fatigue,
and you didn't work him up?

34:24.542 --> 34:28.668
- Is that alcohol on your breath?
- Champagne.

34:28.835 --> 34:30.587
From your mom and big Roland.

34:30.753 --> 34:33.045
Carter, I've been paging you
for three hours.

34:33.213 --> 34:34.630
Sorry, Dr. Hicks.

34:34.797 --> 34:37.716
You're in luck. I have an emergency
appendectomy in 10 minutes.

34:37.882 --> 34:39.882
Kindly scrub in.

34:42.009 --> 34:45.053
Dr. Hicks? Dr. Hicks.

34:45.219 --> 34:48.054
Dr. Hicks. I better think I not-

34:48.221 --> 34:50.556
- I think I better not.
- Why?

34:50.722 --> 34:55.391
I went out to lunch to celebrate
and had a little champagne.

34:55.559 --> 34:58.935
- You drank during rotation hours?
- Yeah.

34:59.310 --> 35:01.728
It's bad enough you failed
to answer your pages...

35:01.895 --> 35:05.564
...but the use of alcohol
on call is inexcusable.

35:05.730 --> 35:08.607
- I'm sorry.
- It's grounds for expulsion.

35:10.066 --> 35:12.150
But...

35:12.317 --> 35:14.235
But I just matched.

35:20.613 --> 35:23.156
Another basket of treats
for our fallen med student?

35:23.323 --> 35:24.533
I'm afraid so.

35:24.699 --> 35:26.492
I'm gonna have to beg off for tonight.

35:26.659 --> 35:29.785
Our friendly in-house attorney
wants me to file an incident report.

35:29.952 --> 35:31.536
I was thinking about canceling too.

35:31.702 --> 35:35.955
No, don't. You go. Have a good time.
Don't let that goatee go to waste.

35:37.164 --> 35:38.748
Did you hear about him and Benton?

35:38.915 --> 35:42.667
Hear about it? I saw them practically
duke it out in the trauma room.

35:42.833 --> 35:46.835
- Benton's right.
- If it was my kid, I'd want to know.

35:47.002 --> 35:48.670
Thanks.

35:48.836 --> 35:53.756
- Carter, I've got another basket.
- Leave it outside.

35:53.923 --> 35:58.175
What have we got?
Pâté, smoked oysters...

35:58.342 --> 36:00.927
...pickled quail eggs...

36:02.511 --> 36:04.470
Are you all right?

36:05.596 --> 36:07.931
I really screwed up.

36:08.098 --> 36:10.556
I neglected my patient,
got really out of control.

36:10.932 --> 36:14.226
What you did was incredibly stupid,
and you're in big trouble.

36:14.683 --> 36:17.268
But Hicks can't expel you
without a hearing.

36:17.435 --> 36:20.604
- Will I lose my match?
- I don't know.

36:20.771 --> 36:23.355
Oh, God!

36:24.397 --> 36:26.982
I'll see what I can do.

36:27.149 --> 36:30.484
Note says, "Love, Nana and Poopie. "

36:34.861 --> 36:36.071
- Hey, Carol.
- Yeah.

36:36.237 --> 36:38.322
- I need some help.
- What is it?

36:38.488 --> 36:41.782
My partner backed over a bum
in the parking lot.

36:44.533 --> 36:47.868
Are you okay, sir?
I didn't see you. I'm sorry.

36:48.035 --> 36:49.911
- Hugo, are you all right?
- What happened?

36:50.077 --> 36:51.995
I was fixing my shoe.

36:52.162 --> 36:54.455
- You forgot to call me a cab.
- Oh, God.

36:54.622 --> 36:59.041
He was sitting on the curb, and I didn't
see him. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

36:59.208 --> 37:02.043
Listen, just stay out here
and don't hurt anyone else.

37:02.209 --> 37:04.127
Cut the kid some slack, Shep.

37:37.853 --> 37:40.563
- It looks like a fractured tib-fib.
- My friends were right.

37:40.730 --> 37:43.231
- This is a dangerous place.
- Oh, Hugo, I'm so sorry.

37:43.398 --> 37:44.648
Me too. It's our fault.

37:44.815 --> 37:48.317
Go check on your partner.
We'll take care of Hugo.

37:48.483 --> 37:51.402
Hey, and go easy on him.

37:56.654 --> 37:59.656
- I told you not to say anything.
- Well, I didn't agree with that.

37:59.823 --> 38:01.949
You took it upon yourself
to tell the family...

38:02.116 --> 38:04.576
...the ramifications of which
affect Doug, me...

38:04.742 --> 38:06.743
...your colleagues
and the entire hospital.

38:06.910 --> 38:11.246
If Ross had caught it four months ago,
that kid might not be losing his leg.

38:11.413 --> 38:14.789
- That wasn't your decision to make.
- I tell the truth and break some code?

38:15.582 --> 38:17.749
This isn't about truth
or any kind of code.

38:17.916 --> 38:19.625
This is about your guilty conscience.

38:19.792 --> 38:22.210
You didn't have the guts
to speak up about Vucelich...

38:22.418 --> 38:24.253
...so you blow the whistle on Doug.

38:24.420 --> 38:29.797
The truth is a lot easier to tell when
it's not your own career on the line.

38:49.266 --> 38:51.892
Hey, where's your partner?

38:52.059 --> 38:55.185
The moron?
He's upstairs drinking cocoa.

38:55.352 --> 38:58.479
You really shouldn't ride him so hard.

38:58.646 --> 39:02.064
The department throws me a rookie.
I guess it's their way of punishing me.

39:03.440 --> 39:06.608
They giving you a hard time?

39:06.775 --> 39:08.818
They say they would have done
the same thing.

39:08.985 --> 39:10.986
You don't believe them?

39:11.152 --> 39:15.780
- What are they supposed to say?
- Nobody blames you, Shep.

39:16.447 --> 39:20.783
- I led Raul into that fire.
- You saved three kids.

39:20.949 --> 39:22.492
And I killed my best friend.

39:33.122 --> 39:35.624
Hey, how's it going?

39:36.791 --> 39:42.086
I saw 48 kids that day.
That's about 12 minutes a kid.

39:42.794 --> 39:44.920
I only gave the Bowman kid about 10.

39:46.088 --> 39:48.964
I guess I should have given him
a couple more.

39:49.506 --> 39:53.633
- Benton was out of line.
- He just told the truth.

39:54.801 --> 39:56.134
Now you have to pay for it.

39:58.469 --> 40:01.346
No, it's the kid who has to pay for it.

40:24.316 --> 40:26.275
How are you doing?

40:37.865 --> 40:41.158
- Excuse me.
- I think I lost my contact.

40:41.325 --> 40:43.868
- Dr. Greene?
- Kathy?

40:44.660 --> 40:48.412
- What are you doing here?
- Same as you, I suspect.

40:50.538 --> 40:52.456
Here. Let me help you.

40:52.623 --> 40:54.999
Don't move.

40:55.166 --> 40:58.626
- Are you sure it's not still in your eye?
- I don't know.

40:58.792 --> 41:01.044
Open wide.

41:02.045 --> 41:04.879
You have one blue eye and one brown.

41:05.046 --> 41:08.173
Yeah, well, for 15 bucks
they throw in the tinted pair.

41:09.506 --> 41:12.175
I'm gonna need my glasses
if I'm gonna find this.

41:12.341 --> 41:15.177
- Do you have lens insurance?
- No.

41:15.343 --> 41:18.011
Then we better keep looking.

41:21.221 --> 41:25.515
- This is so embarrassing.
- Wait. Don't move.

41:27.975 --> 41:30.685
It was caught in your goatee.

41:32.769 --> 41:34.437
Thank you.

41:36.771 --> 41:40.773
What do you want for dinner tonight,
honey? Want some smushed carrots?

41:40.940 --> 41:43.650
I have to talk to you.

41:44.108 --> 41:47.235
- There's nothing more to say.
- Can't I just look at her, please?

41:47.402 --> 41:48.861
Stay away from us.

41:49.028 --> 41:52.405
She's so beautiful. She's so big.

41:52.571 --> 41:54.573
- Is she crawling yet?
- Chloe, I mean it.

41:54.739 --> 41:59.283
I know I can't change what's happened,
but let's not fight, okay?

41:59.450 --> 42:04.161
I saw a lawyer today. She said
I could file for visitation rights.

42:07.121 --> 42:09.747
I'm adopting her.

42:12.248 --> 42:16.084
She's my baby, Susan,
and I want her back.

42:27.339 --> 42:29.674
I'm sorry.

42:37.220 --> 42:40.513
- Hi. Soup of the day to go.
- Sure thing.

42:43.598 --> 42:47.058
- Hey, Peter.
- Hey.

42:47.225 --> 42:49.434
Rough day.

42:50.352 --> 42:52.395
You did the right thing.

42:52.562 --> 42:55.563
Yeah, well, not according
to everybody else.

42:55.729 --> 42:58.064
I broke the code.

42:59.399 --> 43:01.441
Are you okay?

43:02.483 --> 43:05.402
It's kind of like that Boys Club camp.

43:10.238 --> 43:12.738
Did my mother tell you
everything about me?

43:12.905 --> 43:14.115
You were what, 12?

43:16.074 --> 43:17.991
- Ten.
- Yeah, 10.

43:18.158 --> 43:21.618
She said a kid ripped off
the equipment fund...

43:21.785 --> 43:23.744
...showed you the money,
you turned him in.

43:23.911 --> 43:27.664
- And nobody spoke to me all summer.
- I thought they broke your nose.

43:29.915 --> 43:31.499
I told her I took a curve ball.

43:32.916 --> 43:34.959
She knew.

43:39.920 --> 43:43.546
Yeah, well, I guess you never learn.

43:50.884 --> 43:53.260
"Good night, room.

43:55.095 --> 43:58.471
Good night, moon.

43:58.638 --> 44:03.265
Good night,
cow jumping over the moon.

44:04.642 --> 44:07.142
Good night, air.

44:08.519 --> 44:12.437
Good night, bears.

44:12.604 --> 44:15.605
Good night, chairs.

44:16.856 --> 44:19.775
Good night, stars.

44:20.900 --> 44:24.902
Good night, noises everywhere. "
