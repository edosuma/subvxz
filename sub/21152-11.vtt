a three-week fling.

- Well, when Josh falls,
he falls hard.

00:12.967 --> 00:14.800
- Humble-brag much?
- Not me.

00:14.867 --> 00:16.733
I'm happy for him.
I mean, not now.

on a Wednesday night?

00:25.400 --> 00:27.800
- Jay. He's, uh,
he's just asking me out.

00:27.867 --> 00:31.267
- Ooh, you gonna ask him in?
- We are taking it slow.

00:31.333 --> 00:33.467
He is a viable,
legitimate prospect.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.533
- You make him sound
like renters insurance.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
on the Instagram story
since you wouldn't dance.

00:46.067 --> 00:48.133
- Wow, Clare, you and Josh

00:48.200 --> 00:50.000
really packed it
all in this week.

00:50.067 --> 00:51.467
- I know, it would be obnoxious,

00:51.533 --> 00:53.267
except for you guys
are so cute.

00:53.333 --> 00:55.367
- Yeah, but if I only had
a week left with a hot piece--

00:55.433 --> 00:56.667
and I'm talking about Clare--

00:56.733 --> 00:58.000
I'd skip all those tourist traps

00:58.067 --> 01:00.133

get in my last lick.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.433

of licks in.

01:02.500 --> 01:05.100

This is the first time

01:05.167 --> 01:07.167
we've left my room in two days.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.067

I mean, I couldn't
be with you

01:25.833 --> 01:27.600

I can't be with her

Do you have a hospice patient

01:33.167 --> 01:35.100

Now you've gone
and ruined our last snuggle.

This doesn't need to
be our last one.

02:29.333 --> 02:33.633

02:40.767 --> 02:42.400
- I know.
- [chuckles]

02:42.467 --> 02:45.467
I always dreamt of being
a New Yorker...

02:45.533 --> 02:48.167
and dreamed of coming here

02:48.233 --> 02:51.067
and grabbing the city
by the short and curlies

02:51.133 --> 02:53.400

02:53.467 --> 02:56.233
falling in love
with the perfect New York guy.

02:56.300 --> 02:59.133
- And you did it.
- I didn't, though, did I?

02:59.200 --> 03:02.367
I'm going home today.
I failed.

03:02.433 --> 03:06.900
Come on. Failing is
what makes you a New Yorker.

03:06.967 --> 03:09.200
Everyone in this city
gets knocked on their ass.

03:09.267 --> 03:13.600
Whoever gets up...
gets to stay.

03:13.667 --> 03:17.900
- In two years? When I can get
another work visa?

03:17.967 --> 03:19.600
And in the meantime,
we have, what?

03:19.667 --> 03:22.200
A transatlantic relationship?

03:22.267 --> 03:26.933
This was wonderful, but...

04:00.567 --> 04:02.967
Well deserved.

04:03.067 --> 04:05.833
Liza, Kelsey, can you
stay back a moment?

04:08.467 --> 04:10.067
- What's up?
- The manuscript

04:10.133 --> 04:12.533
for "Marriage Vacation"
is going around,

04:12.600 --> 04:15.300
and people are
really responding to it.

04:15.367 --> 04:17.167
Liza, you did a terrific job.

04:17.233 --> 04:19.333
- Thank you.
- It is so strong, in fact,

04:19.400 --> 04:21.867
that we are going to make
a serious awards push.

04:21.933 --> 04:25.200
So we wanted to discuss
a strategy with you.

04:25.267 --> 04:26.300
- Of course, we're in.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.567
- We have so many
marketing ideas--

04:27.633 --> 04:28.967
- We would love
to hear your input,

04:29.067 --> 04:30.733
but first,
we have a pitch of our own.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.500
We think that the book

04:32.567 --> 04:35.467
would have a better chance
for this kind of attention

04:35.533 --> 04:38.933
if it was released
as an Empirical title.

04:39.067 --> 04:40.967
- Empirical has
a strong tradition

04:41.067 --> 04:43.133
of prestige literature.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.533
Purely a branding issue.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.333
- Millennial has a brand,

04:46.400 --> 04:48.500
a very successful one.

04:48.567 --> 04:50.300
- That is not untrue.

04:50.367 --> 04:52.800
But we worry that
the critics would hesitate

04:52.867 --> 04:55.067
to nominate a title
from a house that brought them

04:55.100 --> 04:57.800
a book written
by a labradoodle.

04:57.867 --> 05:00.533
- That book--
while hugely popular

05:00.600 --> 05:02.767
and very important to the bottom
line of this company--

05:02.833 --> 05:04.200
is not our only title.

05:04.267 --> 05:06.067
- What she means is

05:06.133 --> 05:08.100
we do have a youthful brand,

05:08.167 --> 05:09.800
but "Marriage Vacation"
is our first step

05:09.867 --> 05:11.700
towards more mature
territory.

05:11.767 --> 05:15.100
- What do we have to do
to be taken seriously here?

05:15.167 --> 05:18.067
- We will table this for now.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.733
Just something that
we are considering

05:19.800 --> 05:21.733

had a hit all year

05:34.067 --> 05:35.533

to steal ours?

lifts all boats.

05:53.433 --> 05:54.867

on rejection.

05:54.933 --> 05:58.067
I mean, it's so foreign to him.

05:58.133 --> 05:59.667
He wants to meet for dinner.

05:59.733 --> 06:00.833
- Right.
- I've got to get

anything rash, okay?

06:26.667 --> 06:30.133
- All right. First, I went
too far with Edward L.L. Moore.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.800
I'm sorry for that.

06:31.867 --> 06:34.167
And I'm sorry it
screwed things up between us.

06:34.233 --> 06:35.533
I miss you.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.133
- You said this was
about business.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.467
- It's never just business
between us.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.067
- I don't have time for this.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.633
- Okay, wait.
I'm leaving Rivington.

06:43.700 --> 06:46.067
The list of writers that
I inherited isn't a great fit,

07:01.733 --> 07:03.667
- And now you want to go
into business with me?

07:03.733 --> 07:05.700
- We both played
a little too rough.

07:05.767 --> 07:08.133
But what if, instead of
competing with each other,

07:08.200 --> 07:10.400
we were on the same team?

07:10.467 --> 07:12.333

Who's gonna sign with you if you
don't have a publishing house?

07:14.900 --> 07:17.667

has an editor's clause.

If I go, he goes.

09:41.900 --> 09:44.567
both: Good night.

09:45.667 --> 09:47.933
- Wait.

09:48.067 --> 09:50.800
I just read
the final chapter.

09:50.867 --> 09:52.933
It's good, Pauline.
- Really?

09:53.067 --> 09:54.367
- Yeah.
- I was worried

09:54.433 --> 09:58.200
it was too revealing, but...

09:58.267 --> 10:00.667
Liza convinced me
it was the right ending.

10:00.733 --> 10:02.033
- She did, huh?
- Yeah.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.133
She's very insightful.

10:04.200 --> 10:07.067
- Yes, she is.

10:07.133 --> 10:09.300
See you tomorrow?

10:09.367 --> 10:12.333
For the girls. You're clearly
the better storyteller.

- [chuckles]

10:13.867 --> 10:16.333
Okay, great.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.667

I'm a lit manager at Gotham.
- Hi.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.933
- We are all just dying
to read "Marriage Vacation."

10:35.000 --> 10:36.667
- Everybody at "The Cut"
is literally obsessed.

10:36.733 --> 10:38.967
- Okay, now you're
making me nervous.

10:39.033 --> 10:40.200
- Photographer's coming.
Shoo, ladies.

Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo.
- Oh.

10:42.133 --> 10:43.600
- Quick, take these
before he gets here.

10:43.667 --> 10:45.833
- Yeah.
- It's Grandma's secret recipe.

10:45.900 --> 10:49.700
- Ohh, cheers!
- Okay.

10:49.767 --> 10:51.267
- Okay, that's just
straight whiskey.

10:51.333 --> 10:53.367
- Ha.
- That's the secret.

10:53.433 --> 10:54.500
- Not a secret anymore.

kept bugging me

- No, don't be sorry.

11:03.067 --> 11:06.933
I am proud of you.
You should be proud of you.

We need your roller bag.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.333
- Why?
- Josh has a trip,

12:06.400 --> 12:07.467

all of his stuff

Come on.

I mean, could it blow up
in his face?

Horrifically, yes.
But if he doesn't go,

12:39.067 --> 12:40.800
he'll always wonder
what they could have been.

12:40.867 --> 12:43.967
- So Clare didn't
want to do long distance,

12:44.067 --> 12:46.300

to go to Ireland?

- No.
- Eh--

- No, no, no, no, no.
He cannot tell her he's coming.

12:49.533 --> 12:51.067
Uh-uh. She'd just
tell him not to

12:51.067 --> 12:52.333
like she already has
many, many, many times.

[laughs] Well...

13:13.967 --> 13:17.267
So, as you know, Ethan is living
with Richard and me.

13:17.333 --> 13:20.567
But there isn't enough room
for the three of us.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.700
So I was hoping I could
assist you and Ethan

13:23.767 --> 13:27.733
in patching up
whatever's gone awry between you

13:27.800 --> 13:30.800
so that he could move
back into your home.

13:30.867 --> 13:32.067
- I'm not sure I understand

13:32.133 --> 13:33.567
what you're talking about.

13:33.633 --> 13:36.067
Ethan and I have
a very open relationship.

13:36.133 --> 13:37.900
Richard wanted his son
to live with him.

13:37.967 --> 13:39.533
I saw no reason to object.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.333
They're very close.
- Yes, I've noticed.

13:41.400 --> 13:44.867
Um, but I was
under the impression that

13:44.933 --> 13:45.933
you kicked Ethan out.

13:46.067 --> 13:48.533
- Who told you that?

13:48.600 --> 13:49.900
Richard.

13:49.967 --> 13:51.600
And why would I kick
my son out?

13:51.667 --> 13:53.233
- I assume because he
dropped out of school.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.333
- He what? When?
What happened?

13:55.400 --> 13:58.267
- I don't--a few weeks ago.
I don't--I don't know.

13:58.333 --> 14:01.933
- Geoffrey, get my husband
on the phone, please.

14:02.067 --> 14:03.567
This is so Richard!

14:03.633 --> 14:05.300
- Okay, no, hold on.
Please explain to me

14:05.367 --> 14:08.733
why exactly this is so...

14:08.800 --> 14:10.333
Richard.

14:10.400 --> 14:14.200
- Geoffrey, cancel that.
I'll call him later.

14:14.267 --> 14:16.433
I hope you're prepared,

14:16.500 --> 14:18.267
at least emotionally.

14:20.833 --> 14:23.400
- So you're just going
to leave Millennial

14:23.467 --> 14:25.533
to work with Zane.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.133
Kelsey, he almost got you fired.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.767
- I know.
But he has Edward L.L. Moore,

14:29.833 --> 14:32.900
and I just feel like we're not
getting any respect around here.

14:32.967 --> 14:35.333
I mean, Charles is trying to
take away our biggest book.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.867
- Well, it's his company.
It's kind of his call.

14:37.933 --> 14:39.767
- I want to be making
those kinds of calls.

14:39.833 --> 14:41.067
- What about Millennial?

14:41.133 --> 14:42.367
And me?

14:42.433 --> 14:44.967
- You would get to run
your own imprint.

14:45.067 --> 14:47.067
Plus, your stock's
pretty high right now.

14:47.133 --> 14:48.267
You won't even need me.

14:48.333 --> 14:49.900
- Of course I need you.

14:49.967 --> 14:52.233
Kelsey, I just--
I want you to think about this.

14:52.300 --> 14:53.667
- I have.

14:53.733 --> 14:55.633
And running my own company
is my endgame.

14:55.700 --> 14:58.800
And I can either start right now
or in ten years.

14:58.867 --> 15:00.733
- I think you need
to do your homework

15:00.800 --> 15:02.233
before you do anything.

15:02.300 --> 15:05.067
- Liza, we have the biggest
fantasy writer in the world.

15:05.100 --> 15:07.700
- Okay, start there.
Are you sure?

15:07.767 --> 15:09.167
Have you seen the contract?

15:09.233 --> 15:11.067
What does Redmond think
about all this?

15:11.067 --> 15:13.300
I mean, he's repped Moore
for years.

15:13.367 --> 15:18.367
- You're right.
You're right.

15:18.433 --> 15:20.867
Hey, Kelsey Peters

Hey. Have a seat.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.500
You two have met, right?

15:36.567 --> 15:38.633
- Just over the phone.
- You sure?

15:38.700 --> 15:41.367
Town's so small.
We must've met at a party

15:41.433 --> 15:43.467
or an Equinox steam room.

15:43.533 --> 15:45.667
Which one do you go to?
- What's he doing here?

15:45.733 --> 15:48.067
- I called him
about Moore's contract.

15:48.067 --> 15:50.500
He said he wanted to talk to us
about the deal in person.

15:50.567 --> 15:52.733
Redmond, go ahead.
- So let me get this straight--

15:52.800 --> 15:56.600
you've left Rivington
to go what, freelance?

15:56.667 --> 15:59.467
And you think one
of the best-selling authors

15:59.533 --> 16:03.200
in the world is just gonna
follow you

16:03.267 --> 16:08.400
and your perfect cheekbones
down to the unemployment line.

16:08.467 --> 16:09.567
Oh.

16:09.633 --> 16:11.733
You poor beautiful idiot.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.233
- Is there or is there not
an editor's clause

16:14.300 --> 16:16.133
in Moore's contract?
- There is.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.233
It states in very clear English
that Edward can leave

16:19.300 --> 16:20.767
if his editor does,

16:20.833 --> 16:22.267
but he doesn't have to.

16:22.333 --> 16:24.100
And if this is your plan,

16:24.167 --> 16:25.433
he's not going to.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.133
- Redmond,
I know you're concerned

16:27.200 --> 16:29.067
about your client going
with an independent.

16:29.100 --> 16:32.367
But let me assure you,
I can sell Edward L.L. Moore.

16:32.433 --> 16:36.067
- Craigslist could sell him.
Get over yourself.

16:36.133 --> 16:37.767
You can find him
an established publisher

16:37.833 --> 16:39.933
run by a grown-up,
but I'm not going to let him

16:40.067 --> 16:43.133
leave Rivington to join you
in the gig economy.

16:43.200 --> 16:46.667
- We'd be streamlined and open
to new distribution strategies.

16:46.733 --> 16:48.200
Kelsey, help me explain
to Redmond

16:48.267 --> 16:49.567
what we're planning here.

16:49.633 --> 16:52.300
- [chuckles] Oh.
We aren't planning anything.

all day.

17:20.167 --> 17:22.500
I heard from Winnie.

17:22.567 --> 17:24.700
Let me explain.

17:27.267 --> 17:28.733
Did I lie to you? Yes.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.633
But I did it for my son.

17:30.700 --> 17:33.100
His grades dropped,
he asked me not to tell her,

17:33.167 --> 17:34.633
and I did--
- I know what happened, Richard.

17:34.700 --> 17:36.833
Your son was cornered,
so he manipulated you

17:36.900 --> 17:37.967
to get out of it.

17:38.067 --> 17:39.500
Just like you manipulated me

17:39.567 --> 17:41.100
when you needed
a place to live.

17:41.167 --> 17:42.400
- Hold on.
- I let you talk me into it

17:42.467 --> 17:44.500
because I liked you...

17:44.567 --> 17:46.333
and I liked how much
you liked me.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.467
- Love.

17:47.533 --> 17:48.800
How much I love you.

17:48.867 --> 17:51.267
- That's the thing--
you love me,

17:51.333 --> 17:52.400
you love Winnie,

17:52.467 --> 17:55.633
but you lied to both of us.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.200
And you haven't even
apologized for it.

17:58.267 --> 18:01.333
- I'm sorry.

18:01.400 --> 18:05.267
Diana, Diana, please, please.

18:05.333 --> 18:07.533
We are so good together.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.133
You were so closed off
when we first met.

18:10.200 --> 18:11.867
Look how you've grown.

18:11.933 --> 18:14.233
- I have grown.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.867
A few months ago,
I thought I had to put up

18:15.933 --> 18:17.567
with someone I knew
was manipulating me.

18:17.633 --> 18:19.533
And now I know
I deserve better.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.833
I'm gonna be late.

18:22.900 --> 18:26.267
- Can I have a few days
to find a place for us to live?

18:26.333 --> 18:28.067
- That's how this all started.

18:28.100 --> 18:30.267
There are boxes and tape
laid out in the closet.

[upbeat pop music]

19:07.867 --> 19:09.233
- I'm so sorry, Diana.

19:09.300 --> 19:11.267
I know how much
you cared for Richard, and I'm--

19:11.333 --> 19:12.633
I'm just so sorry
that it happened

19:12.700 --> 19:14.467
right before you--

19:14.533 --> 19:16.667
- Before I step
onto the red carpet alone?

19:16.733 --> 19:19.133
I won the award, not him.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.433
- Right.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.133
- You know,
before I met Richard,

19:22.200 --> 19:24.200
I was prepared to accept
that this might be my life--

19:24.267 --> 19:26.633
no plus-one,
no one beaming like an idiot

19:26.700 --> 19:29.567
next to me in photographs,
and I was okay with it then,

19:29.633 --> 19:32.367
and I am okay with it now.

19:33.367 --> 19:35.067
- Ready?

19:43.800 --> 19:45.633
- * Oh, oh, ohh *

19:45.700 --> 19:48.067
* Oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh *

19:50.733 --> 19:53.067
- Stoop, please.

19:54.933 --> 19:56.667
- How's your mom?
- She's all healed.

19:56.733 --> 19:58.067
- Oh.
- And, more importantly,

19:58.067 --> 20:00.900
vacated, so the place
is all ours.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.800
Uh-oh. You know that
Brooks Brothers mannequin

20:02.867 --> 20:04.100
that runs your company?

20:04.167 --> 20:07.333
He's coming this way.
Act young.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.567
- Good evening. Congrats on
"The Picnic Table," Jay.

20:10.633 --> 20:13.800
And a great photo
in "The Post" of you two.

20:13.867 --> 20:15.333
- All anyone wanted
to talk about

20:15.400 --> 20:17.300
was your star editor.
- Oh.

20:17.367 --> 20:19.300
- We're, uh,
we're very proud of her.

20:19.367 --> 20:21.433
And the book is going
to be big for the company.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.433
- How is it for the marriage?
- Jay.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.800
Come on, that's private.
- Everybody's talking about it.

20:25.867 --> 20:27.467
- Oh, stop.
He's exaggerating.

20:27.533 --> 20:30.433
- It's fine. I, uh, guess
I'll have to get used it.

20:30.500 --> 20:33.133
Truth be told, I don't know
what the future holds.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.667
But the book has definitely
made some changes

20:35.733 --> 20:37.733
in our relationship.
- I'm happy for you.

20:37.800 --> 20:42.333
I mean it. You and Pauline
were great together.

20:42.400 --> 20:45.767
- Speaking of which,
she's, uh, waving me over.

20:45.833 --> 20:48.067
Excuse me.
- Of course.

20:53.167 --> 20:54.600
- [chuckles]

20:56.933 --> 20:59.667
- I'll be back.

20:59.733 --> 21:03.333
Hey. One more.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.700
Oh. I know you're not
sitting with Rivington.

21:05.767 --> 21:07.333
Is there a pariah's table here?

21:07.400 --> 21:08.733
- I knew you were
a shark, Peters.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.367
Didn't peg you
for a tattler, though.

21:10.433 --> 21:12.600
- The only reason
I called Redmond

21:12.667 --> 21:14.167
was to see
if you were gaming me,

21:14.233 --> 21:16.067
which you were.
- I wasn't gaming you.

21:16.100 --> 21:18.367
I was trying to get you on my
side before approaching Moore.

21:18.433 --> 21:19.933
- Why didn't you
just say that?

21:20.067 --> 21:23.500
- You weren't talking to me
until yesterday.

21:23.567 --> 21:26.533
I took a big swing,
and I missed.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.833
- So what are you gonna
do now for work?

21:28.900 --> 21:31.267
What about Edward?
- Don't worry about me, Peters.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.133
I always land on my feet.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.467
You'll hear about it
sooner than you think.

21:34.533 --> 21:36.067
- What is that supposed
to mean?

21:36.067 --> 21:37.833
You know what?
I don't want to know.

21:37.900 --> 21:40.300
You and work don't mix well.

21:40.367 --> 21:42.067
- What about you and me?

21:42.100 --> 21:43.733
Outside of work,
how does that mix?

21:43.800 --> 21:45.333
- That was never the problem.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.200
I mean, you were great in bed.

21:47.267 --> 21:48.500
You're just bad for business.

21:48.567 --> 21:50.067
- Then we won't talk business.

21:52.800 --> 21:55.700
- I'd like to thank
our Empirical family

21:55.767 --> 21:58.800
for coming out to support
Diana Trout

21:58.867 --> 22:00.900
on this richly deserved honor.

22:00.967 --> 22:02.900
And speaking of
our Empirical family,

22:02.967 --> 22:06.933
I am pleased to announce that
a very important family member

22:07.067 --> 22:10.333
has finally come home.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.333
So let me be
the first to tell you...

22:13.400 --> 22:16.900
that Edward L.L. Moore
is back at Empirical.

22:16.967 --> 22:18.433
- [chuckles]
- Oh, my--

22:18.500 --> 22:20.467
- That's incredible news.
- That's amazing.

22:20.533 --> 22:21.900
[indistinct chatter]

22:21.967 --> 22:24.233
- That is a get.

22:24.300 --> 22:26.433
- Wow. How'd he pull that off?

22:26.500 --> 22:28.367
- I'm so sorry.
Um, excuse me.

22:28.433 --> 22:30.667
I have to use
the ladies' room.

22:32.433 --> 22:37.067
- And, uh, I have one more
announcement to make.

22:37.067 --> 22:39.200
In addition
to Edward's return,

22:39.267 --> 22:41.067
I would also like you
to welcome

22:41.133 --> 22:43.500
Empirical's newest
executive editor...

22:46.400 --> 22:48.200
Zane Anders.

22:48.267 --> 22:50.100
Cheers. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

22:50.167 --> 22:55.433
* *

22:55.500 --> 22:57.633
- Game on, Peters.

23:01.600 --> 23:02.767
- Okay.

23:02.833 --> 23:05.067
Oh, my gosh, Liza!
There you are!

23:05.133 --> 23:07.833
I couldn't find you
in all the chaos.

23:07.900 --> 23:09.500
Can you believe
we got Moore back?

23:09.567 --> 23:10.533
- We?

23:10.600 --> 23:12.067
- Um, I--

23:12.067 --> 23:13.933
No, I'm sorry.
Empirical.

23:14.067 --> 23:15.433
- Quite a coup, Up-Chuck.

23:15.500 --> 23:17.433
You want to buy me
a drink to celebrate?

23:17.500 --> 23:19.967
- I, uh, I think we should
get home to the girls.

23:20.067 --> 23:21.267
- Okay.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.667
All right, um...

23:23.733 --> 23:25.300
I don't know how to thank you.

23:25.367 --> 23:27.433
- For what?
- It's only the guest room,

23:27.500 --> 23:30.433
but I'm finally back home.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.633
I feel like this book
has done everything

23:32.700 --> 23:36.467
I ever dreamed of, and you
helped make it so much better.

23:36.533 --> 23:38.933
I can never thank you enough.

23:41.467 --> 23:42.733
both: Good night.

23:42.800 --> 23:47.433
- Good night.
[car door opens, closes]

23:47.500 --> 23:50.200
- You okay?
- Yeah, um, you know what?

23:50.267 --> 23:52.067
Let's--I'm fine.

23:52.067 --> 23:55.167
Let's just--let's, uh,
let's get out of here.

23:55.233 --> 23:57.067
I can't--

23:57.067 --> 23:59.133
- Hey.

You're in love with Charles.

24:11.433 --> 24:13.500
- * I need a miracle *

24:13.567 --> 24:17.467
- [sighs] I am.

24:17.533 --> 24:18.533
I do love him.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.567
I know that I shouldn't,
but I do.

24:20.633 --> 24:22.600
- * I'm losing my mind *

24:22.667 --> 24:24.167
- And you're so nice!

24:24.233 --> 24:25.900
- Hey.

24:25.967 --> 24:28.333
- You're so nice,
and I'm so sorry.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.133

24:30.200 --> 24:32.667

don't let me *

24:32.733 --> 24:35.533
* Don't let me down *

24:35.600 --> 24:36.467
* Don't let me down *
