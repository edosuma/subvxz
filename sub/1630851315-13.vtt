WEBVTT

00:05.527 --> 00:07.920
<i>Previously on</i> Hawai'i...

00:07.964 --> 00:09.444
David Sola, who works

00:09.487 --> 00:11.663
with the New Zealand
Security Intelligence Service.

00:11.707 --> 00:14.188
I had an asset.
She had been threatened.

00:14.231 --> 00:15.711
Pretty sure it was MSS,
Chinese intelligence,

00:15.754 --> 00:16.886
but I have no proof.

00:16.929 --> 00:19.236
Voilà. We got enough images

00:19.280 --> 00:21.282
of the driver and the
man who grabbed Yen

00:21.325 --> 00:23.110
to create a pretty good
likeness.

00:23.153 --> 00:25.068
Your friend's a professor
at UH, right?

00:25.112 --> 00:26.156
Maggie.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.549
You haven't seen
any of these men

00:27.592 --> 00:29.029
- on campus, have you?
- This guy.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.291
The Chinese referred to him

00:30.334 --> 00:32.075
Bao.

00:32.119 --> 00:35.165
This is the man we believe
is running Operation Dark Moon.

00:35.209 --> 00:37.341
- What's his name?
- Enlai Ying.

00:37.385 --> 00:39.039
I started looking at the
suspected Dark Moon operations

00:39.082 --> 00:40.562
we identified.

00:40.605 --> 00:43.043
There is no way
he could have run all those ops.

00:43.086 --> 00:44.479
Enlai Ying isn't Bao.

00:44.522 --> 00:46.002
I think this is the real Bao.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.351
<i>And he's still in the wind.</i>

00:47.395 --> 00:48.918
You want to say what
these locations are?

00:48.961 --> 00:51.747
All places Maggie has traveled
the past few years.

00:51.790 --> 00:53.618
Is Maggie Shaw working
for the Chinese?

00:53.662 --> 00:55.011
Is everything okay?

00:55.055 --> 00:57.448
Everything's just fine.

01:09.634 --> 01:12.115
Yeah, the Company's not gonna reimburse you for that,

01:12.159 --> 01:14.596
no matter how well you did
in your interview today.

01:14.639 --> 01:17.294
Hey, Paul. I'll
take one of those.

01:17.338 --> 01:18.600
Sure thing.

01:20.167 --> 01:22.082
Hi, Jane Tennant.

01:22.125 --> 01:23.605
First in your class at UVA,

01:23.648 --> 01:26.912
double major--
psychology and global studies.

01:26.956 --> 01:31.395
All set for State Department,
but you put in for the CIA.

01:31.439 --> 01:34.006
Everybody wanted you,
but you chose us.

01:34.050 --> 01:36.400
I want to be
where the action is.

01:36.444 --> 01:37.793
Then why did you agree
to be an analyst

01:37.836 --> 01:39.229
at the Philippines desk?

01:39.273 --> 01:40.665
Because I'm... Fluent in Tagalog.

01:40.709 --> 01:43.407
I know your cultural
background. What I'm asking

01:43.451 --> 01:45.670
is, why you want to be
stuck in a basement

01:45.714 --> 01:48.456
doing background assessments
of minor politicians

01:48.499 --> 01:51.459
when you could be
where the action really is?

01:52.503 --> 01:54.418
- You were in my interview today.
- Mm-hmm.

01:54.462 --> 01:56.333
But you stayed in the back
of the room.
Hmm.

01:56.377 --> 01:59.119
Which says you weren't
supposed to be there.

01:59.162 --> 02:01.904
But also
no one told you to leave.

02:01.947 --> 02:03.166
And what does that say?

02:03.210 --> 02:05.081
They're scared of you.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.430
I wish.

02:06.474 --> 02:09.041
Thank you, Paul.
Thank you.

02:09.085 --> 02:11.087
- You're her, aren't you?
- Hmm.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.610
The one they call the Oracle.

02:12.654 --> 02:15.352
You're the one hunting al-Qaeda
cells all over the world.

02:15.396 --> 02:16.832
Well, I wouldn't be
very good at my job

02:16.875 --> 02:19.530
if I admitted
to my accomplishments, would I?

02:19.574 --> 02:21.924
They say you're the best female
operative the Agency has.

02:21.967 --> 02:24.013
Well, that is
just wrong.

02:24.056 --> 02:27.538
I am the best operative, period.

02:30.498 --> 02:32.804
- Why me?
- You are smart.

02:32.848 --> 02:35.372
You could have done anything,
but you chose this.

02:35.416 --> 02:37.244
And not for ambition.

02:37.287 --> 02:38.462
You're a true believer.

02:38.506 --> 02:40.160
Well, I just think... Not done.

02:40.203 --> 02:43.598
You're also fresh-faced,
you're a romantic.

02:43.641 --> 02:45.077
Naive.

02:45.121 --> 02:47.602
But with a little training
and a lot of listening...

02:47.645 --> 02:50.909
darling,
no one will see you coming.

02:50.953 --> 02:53.042
What do you say,
Janey Tennant?

02:53.085 --> 02:55.566
You want to save
the world with me?

03:06.273 --> 03:08.318
I've been through every nook
and cranny three times.

03:08.362 --> 03:10.668
Not a bug in the house,
electronic or otherwise.

03:10.712 --> 03:12.366
Appreciate it.

03:12.409 --> 03:15.673
If we're really doing this, we
should do it from the office.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.501
I want to make sure
my ducks are in a row first.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.026
Ah, and there are your ducks.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.550
Hey.

03:22.593 --> 03:24.334
Thanks for coming in
on a Saturday.

03:24.378 --> 03:25.944
No sweat. Brought bagels.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.163
Malasadas.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.426
I brought coffee,
but it spilled.

03:29.470 --> 03:30.471
Nice.

03:30.514 --> 03:32.516
All right, let's get to it.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.779
I think there's a high-level
mole in U.S. intelligence

03:34.823 --> 03:35.998
here in Hawai'i.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.739
Who?

03:39.262 --> 03:41.090
Maggie Shaw?

03:41.133 --> 03:43.048
Your best friend?

03:43.092 --> 03:44.572
There are discrepancies
in her story

03:44.615 --> 03:48.228
about being abducted
by MSS here in Hawai'i.

03:48.271 --> 03:49.446
You think the abduction
was a setup?

03:49.490 --> 03:50.882
You think Maggie was in on it?

03:50.926 --> 03:52.232
I do.

03:52.275 --> 03:53.885
To cover up the fact
that she was working

03:53.929 --> 03:55.757
with Chinese intelligence.

03:57.367 --> 03:59.239
We looked into her travel itineraries

03:59.282 --> 04:00.544
over the last few years.

04:00.588 --> 04:03.939
They match some major
intelligence leaks.

04:03.982 --> 04:05.680
Any proof?

04:05.723 --> 04:06.855
No.

04:06.898 --> 04:08.900
That's why you're here.

04:08.944 --> 04:10.380
We need to look
into every aspect

04:10.424 --> 04:12.556
of Maggie's life and career.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.950
No offense, boss, but you're
talking about an espionage

04:14.993 --> 04:18.301
investigation of a U.S. citizen.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.085
You need more than "I think."

04:20.129 --> 04:21.391
Jesse.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.132
No. He's right, and I know

04:23.175 --> 04:25.265
I'm personally involved.

04:25.308 --> 04:28.224
Which is why I'm opening
our circle to one more.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.574
Hello. The
door was open.

04:31.575 --> 04:32.881
Am I late? I...

04:32.924 --> 04:34.491
brought coffee.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.974
Shoes off.

04:39.017 --> 04:41.455
Right. Sorry.

04:43.021 --> 04:45.459
Hang on. We're inviting DIA?

04:45.502 --> 04:47.287
They don't have
any jurisdiction here.

04:47.330 --> 04:50.115
True, uh, but the FBI
SAC is a mentor of mine.

04:50.159 --> 04:51.508
He's willing to bless
this operation.

04:51.552 --> 04:53.858
As long as we present
a compelling case.

04:53.902 --> 04:55.730
So that's what we're gonna do.

04:56.992 --> 04:59.516
Look, I'm asking
for help here.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.213
We're gonna open the books
on Maggie Shaw.

05:01.257 --> 05:03.433
We work quickly and quietly.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.654
And I hope to God I'm wrong.

05:20.363 --> 05:22.974
Maggie Shaw appears to be
as clean as they come.

05:23.018 --> 05:24.802
Lives within her means,
collecting

05:24.846 --> 05:27.979
a government pension and her
salary from the university.

05:28.023 --> 05:29.981
Pays her bills on time,
gives to charity.

05:30.025 --> 05:31.200
Every foreign trip she takes

05:31.243 --> 05:32.375
is okayed through the CIA,

05:32.419 --> 05:33.898
who she continues
to consult with.

05:33.942 --> 05:36.379
Which means she has regular
security interviews

05:36.423 --> 05:38.512
to maintain
her top secret clearance.

05:38.555 --> 05:41.166
Not one red flag.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.472
I know.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.518
Feels wrong, doesn't it?

05:44.561 --> 05:46.824
Scrutinizing a friend's
life with a fine-tooth comb?

05:46.868 --> 05:48.826
No, I mean, she's too clean.

05:48.870 --> 05:51.002
Everyone has something buried
in a box on the upper shelf

05:51.046 --> 05:54.397
of the bedroom closet behind
a pair of old hiking boots.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.836
Metaphorically speaking,
of course.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.360
Uh...

06:01.186 --> 06:03.667
Maggie is the best
operative I ever met.

06:03.711 --> 06:05.495
If she's a double agent,
we're not proving it

06:05.539 --> 06:06.931
with public records.

06:06.975 --> 06:08.629
She knows how to
keep herself clean.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.239
Need access to her
internal life.

06:10.282 --> 06:12.633
You're the only one
who can do that.

06:12.676 --> 06:15.200
We can also look
into her foreign trips.

06:15.244 --> 06:17.246
That's where she would have
contact with MSS.

06:17.289 --> 06:20.249
Give it a shot.
Ernie, stay on her digital life.

06:20.292 --> 06:22.382
Secret emails, messaging apps.
Yep.

06:22.425 --> 06:25.254
Lucy, review what
we know so far.

06:27.735 --> 06:29.954
Something on your mind?

06:29.998 --> 06:31.608
My gut says
you might be right here.

06:31.652 --> 06:33.175
But...

06:33.218 --> 06:35.133
- But Maggie's important to you.
- Well, she's like family.

06:35.177 --> 06:37.440
Which means you can't
- be objective.
- I don't have a choice here.

06:37.484 --> 06:41.226
Sure you do. The FBI's
got buy-in, hand it to them.

06:41.270 --> 06:42.706
I would like to, but...

06:42.750 --> 06:46.580
I need to make sure
we're 100% on the right track.

06:46.623 --> 06:48.103
Well, if she's as good
as you say,

06:48.146 --> 06:49.539
how are we ever gonna be 100%?

06:49.583 --> 06:51.498
Greetings

06:51.541 --> 06:53.021
and salutations.

06:53.064 --> 06:55.458
Didn't you have a flight
to catch back to New Zealand?

06:55.502 --> 06:56.590
I did.

06:56.633 --> 06:57.982
But I missed it.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.812
You have something on Bao,
don't you?

07:01.856 --> 07:03.292
This is the one photo we have

07:03.335 --> 07:04.554
of our missing
Chinese operative

07:04.598 --> 07:06.034
code-named Bao.

07:06.077 --> 07:08.471
Yeah, I was pursuing him
when the traffic cam took that.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.908
He was in Hawai'i trying to get
access to a satellite program.

07:10.952 --> 07:13.345
Operation went sideways.

07:13.389 --> 07:15.173
- And he fled.
- Maybe.

07:15.217 --> 07:16.871
I shared this photo
with my contacts

07:16.914 --> 07:21.266
down at MI6, CSIS, ASIS, CIA.

07:21.310 --> 07:24.922
Ran it through their databases
and came back with this.

07:24.966 --> 07:26.446
It's Bao.

07:26.489 --> 07:28.273
These were taken by various
agencies over the years.

07:28.317 --> 07:30.406
Previously unidentified.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.755
But definitely involved
in several

07:31.799 --> 07:33.496
high-profile MSS operations.

07:33.540 --> 07:34.976
Bao gets around.

07:35.019 --> 07:37.457
That mean you were able
to get a hard I.D. on him now?

07:37.500 --> 07:39.459
Uh, no, he's still a mystery,
but Australian intelligence

07:39.502 --> 07:42.853
did I.D. a man in Hong Kong
who's somehow connected to Bao.

07:42.897 --> 07:45.116
Some sort of go-between for MSS.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.336
Bao reached out to him
three hours ago

07:47.379 --> 07:48.468
and told him that his flight
back home

07:48.511 --> 07:50.426
is being delayed by two days.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.993
All right,
Bao is still in Hawai'i?

07:52.036 --> 07:53.473
That doesn't make any sense.

07:53.516 --> 07:55.910
We took down his entire network,
he barely escaped.

07:55.953 --> 07:57.389
Why would he stick around?

07:57.433 --> 07:58.956
I don't know,
maybe some unfinished business?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.045
But we have a shot here
at taking

08:01.089 --> 08:03.091
a major piece
off the chessboard.

08:06.703 --> 08:08.792
Y-You guys are looking at
each other funny again.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.707
What-what don't I know?

08:10.751 --> 08:13.797
What if we took
two pieces off the board?

08:13.841 --> 08:14.972
How?

08:15.973 --> 08:18.106
With a little bit of trust.

08:23.285 --> 08:27.115
- So?
- It's good. We got him, Maggie.

08:27.158 --> 08:29.073
A direct line to al-Baqri.

08:29.117 --> 08:31.162
So you're telling me
that your shawarma guy

08:31.206 --> 08:34.122
is a direct line
to our al-Qaeda mastermind?

08:34.165 --> 08:35.993
They're from the same village.

08:36.037 --> 08:37.168
And so he's just gonna

08:37.212 --> 08:38.822
give us his address?

08:38.866 --> 08:43.000
The address, phone number,
shoe size. Everything.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.480
What's in it for him?

08:44.524 --> 08:45.873
The money.

08:45.916 --> 08:47.527
No, that's incentive.

08:47.570 --> 08:50.225
What I'm asking is,
what's his angle?

08:50.268 --> 08:53.054
Because he's risking
his life here.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.318
He lost his sister
in a bombing last year,

08:56.361 --> 08:58.363
nearly died himself,
so he's got skin in the game.

08:58.407 --> 08:59.669
Okay.

08:59.713 --> 09:03.064
Trust. That's the key
to our work here, Janey.

09:03.107 --> 09:04.848
Coin of the realm. I know.

09:04.892 --> 09:06.415
No, it's more
than currency.

09:06.458 --> 09:07.808
It's survival.

09:07.851 --> 09:12.552
You have to earn it and tend it
and cultivate it.

09:13.770 --> 09:16.599
But the dirty secret is,
you can't really rely on it.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.340
Except us, right?

09:18.383 --> 09:21.038
Except us.
I'll follow you anywhere.

09:21.082 --> 09:23.650
So, go set the meet,

09:23.693 --> 09:26.217
and let's bring Shawarma in.

09:30.265 --> 09:32.310
I think we can draw Bao out.

09:32.354 --> 09:34.095
That'd be impressive.

09:34.138 --> 09:36.401
What, you have some sort
of idea of where he is?

09:36.445 --> 09:37.664
No clue.

09:37.707 --> 09:40.231
Then how are you gonna draw him out?

09:42.886 --> 09:45.193
We're gonna read Maggie Shaw
in on the operation.

09:45.236 --> 09:46.150
Every detail.

09:46.194 --> 09:47.630
We're what?

09:47.674 --> 09:50.459
She's gonna lead us
right to Bao.

10:24.754 --> 10:26.495
We're alone, right?

10:28.453 --> 10:31.543
Did you pack a bag like I said?

10:34.721 --> 10:36.200
Raja, listen.

10:36.244 --> 10:38.202
This is going to be very easy.

10:38.246 --> 10:39.464
You just follow me outside,

10:39.508 --> 10:41.771
and there's
a car waiting.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.338
Everything's okay.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.112
Okay, you're okay,
you're okay.

11:18.155 --> 11:19.330
I got you.

11:19.374 --> 11:21.071
Here, just deep breaths.
Deep breaths.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.682
You're okay now.

11:26.250 --> 11:29.297
Why the mystery, Janey?

11:30.428 --> 11:33.301
No mystery, just urgency.

11:35.042 --> 11:37.348
- Need your help.
- The Bao case?

11:37.392 --> 11:39.524
If you're willing to come
out of retirement for a day.

11:39.568 --> 11:40.700
Depends.

11:40.743 --> 11:42.614
Is lunch included?

12:06.638 --> 12:08.553
Ooh, can I pick the lock?

12:08.597 --> 12:10.642
You remember what
happened last time?

12:10.686 --> 12:13.210
You weren't even on the team
yet. How do you know about that?

12:13.254 --> 12:16.823
Everybody knows, Lucy. Look,
I'll pick the lock, okay?

12:18.825 --> 12:21.392
Guys, no need.

12:21.436 --> 12:23.743
Well, that's not very spy-like.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.701
Let's do this.

12:29.270 --> 12:33.796
So, you're telling me
that Enlai Ying is not Bao.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.842
No, he was a city cop
in Shanghai

12:35.885 --> 12:37.191
for most of Bao's operations.

12:37.234 --> 12:39.236
- In theory.
- Not theory, it's a fact.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.412
Well, there's no such thing
in our work.

12:41.456 --> 12:42.805
Maybe not in intelligence,
but in law enforcement,

12:42.849 --> 12:44.764
we follow the evidence.

12:44.807 --> 12:47.070
Ying had a very busy career

12:47.114 --> 12:49.638
busting drug dealers
and prostitution rings.

12:49.681 --> 12:52.772
He didn't even leave Shanghai
until retiring.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.774
Well, all of this could be
manufactured. Elaborate cover.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.340
Ying wasn't a super spy.

12:56.384 --> 12:59.735
He was muscle,
hired by MSS to kidnap and kill.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.258
Maybe.

13:01.302 --> 13:03.565
Think about it, Maggie.
Bao is a string puller.

13:03.608 --> 13:06.524
He's not gonna get his hands
dirty. This makes sense.

13:06.568 --> 13:09.266
- Okay, let's say you're right.
- We are right.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.528
Well, so what else
have you got?

13:10.572 --> 13:12.530
Besides the theory
that none of the men

13:12.574 --> 13:14.794
that you took down
is the mastermind?

13:14.837 --> 13:17.231
That's why you're here, Maggie.

13:17.274 --> 13:19.102
We need the Oracle.

13:21.191 --> 13:22.802
Excuse me.

13:22.845 --> 13:24.760
Hey.

13:24.804 --> 13:25.979
Ernie, what do you know?

13:26.022 --> 13:27.502
Other than Maggie owns
way too many

13:27.545 --> 13:30.200
serving dishes for someone
who never entertains?

13:30.244 --> 13:32.028
I'm assuming that's not why
you called.

13:32.072 --> 13:33.551
No. But honestly?

13:33.595 --> 13:36.816
Two fondue pots?
What's she trying to prove?

13:36.859 --> 13:38.469
Uh, anything indictable?

13:38.513 --> 13:40.602
Nothing. We've been over
every inch of this place.

13:40.645 --> 13:42.473
I've installed cameras and
listening devices everywhere.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.258
If there's something,
we'll learn it.

13:44.301 --> 13:45.868
Plus, we're about to start
pulling apart

13:45.912 --> 13:47.304
the walls and furniture.

13:47.348 --> 13:49.132
Yeah, hopefully
that's a metaphor.

13:49.176 --> 13:51.352
Whatever makes you feel better.

13:51.395 --> 13:52.962
- All right, keep me posted.
- Yep.

13:55.008 --> 13:55.965
Hey, hey, hey. Check it out.

13:56.009 --> 13:57.575
You got something?

13:57.619 --> 14:00.535
Hidden compartment in the
crawl space above the bedroom.

14:00.578 --> 14:01.449
Nice work.

14:01.492 --> 14:02.972
Wasn't easy getting up there.

14:03.016 --> 14:04.713
Right now we got to get
this place back together ASAP.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.368
Kill the power tools.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.152
I appreciate your faith in me,

14:09.196 --> 14:11.502
but if I could pull Bao
out of a hat,

14:11.546 --> 14:13.330
we would have caught him
years ago.

14:13.374 --> 14:14.331
Well, what if we can?

14:14.375 --> 14:15.767
What?

14:15.811 --> 14:17.160
Pull Bao out of a hat.

14:17.204 --> 14:19.293
Well, that would be
very impressive, Janey.

14:19.336 --> 14:20.337
We've got chatter

14:20.381 --> 14:21.773
that Bao is still in Hawai'i.

14:21.817 --> 14:22.905
Chatter?

14:22.949 --> 14:24.820
It's just glorified gossip.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.387
We also have proof.

14:26.430 --> 14:28.519
This was taken earlier today.

14:29.390 --> 14:32.219
That's the man we believe
to be Bao, here in Honolulu.

14:33.829 --> 14:36.223
Way to bury your lede.

14:36.266 --> 14:38.181
- Got to make it interesting.
- Mm.

14:38.225 --> 14:39.879
Do you recognize him?

14:39.922 --> 14:41.184
Uh, no.

14:41.228 --> 14:44.231
But that's not a
surprise. He's young.

14:44.274 --> 14:46.320
And I haven't done
this for a while.

14:46.363 --> 14:48.322
Why would he still be here?

14:48.365 --> 14:51.716
His mission failed.
His team taken down.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.805
Maybe he doesn't have
an exit strategy.

14:53.849 --> 14:56.896
Maybe there's a loose end.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.506
Can I get a copy
of this picture?

14:58.549 --> 15:01.074
I want to show it
to some folks at Langley.

15:03.032 --> 15:04.033
Of course.

15:04.077 --> 15:05.905
Good work.

15:05.948 --> 15:08.603
You still owe me lunch.

15:12.694 --> 15:15.566
That's not the steeping of a woman who's worried

15:15.610 --> 15:17.568
- her cover's blown.
- If she's working with Bao,

15:17.612 --> 15:20.528
she'd contact him by now,
tell him NCIS is onto him.

15:20.571 --> 15:22.747
Well, she's not worried because
she didn't take the bait.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.749
She knows Tennant lied to her.
All we know for sure

15:24.793 --> 15:27.056
is that Maggie likes
her Darjeeling strong.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.580
You overplayed your hand
with the doctored photo.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.756
You're just upset 'cause
you didn't think of it yourself.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.584
I'm upset because
she didn't tell me.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.543
I didn't tell you because
you would have tried to stop me.

15:35.586 --> 15:37.023
Yeah, because
it was reckless.

15:37.066 --> 15:38.894
- Pot meet kettle.
- Well, plus

15:38.938 --> 15:41.418
we did find the hidden
thumb drive in Maggie's house.

15:41.462 --> 15:43.333
That thing is so encrypted,
it's gonna take weeks to hack.

15:43.377 --> 15:44.769
There's no trapping

15:44.813 --> 15:46.380
Maggie Shaw
without being bold.

15:46.423 --> 15:48.295
If we would have told her
we think Bao was still in town,

15:48.338 --> 15:49.861
it wouldn't have worked.

15:49.905 --> 15:51.167
We had to show her.

15:51.211 --> 15:52.647
Maggie probably knows
exactly where Bao's been

15:52.690 --> 15:54.997
this whole time, and knows
that photo is doctored.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.390
Well, then she knows
we're lying to her.

15:56.433 --> 15:57.782
And realizes we suspect her.

15:57.826 --> 15:59.828
Yeah, but we lose the chance
at catching Bao,

15:59.871 --> 16:02.048
you know, the most wanted
Chinese spy in the world?

16:02.091 --> 16:04.006
But we'll force Maggie
to make a move.

16:04.050 --> 16:06.443
I don't care
- about Maggie Shaw.
- I do.

16:06.487 --> 16:08.271
Uh, guys,
gonna want to see this.

16:08.315 --> 16:10.012
What? She open a box
of biscuits?

16:10.056 --> 16:11.535
She got a text
from someone.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.276
- Who?
- Unknown number.

16:13.320 --> 16:16.323
Confirming her
cake is ready?

16:18.064 --> 16:20.283
Lucy and Kai are at her house.

16:20.327 --> 16:21.981
Have them follow her,
give me the details.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.460
- I'll get Jesse.
- I'm coming, too.

16:23.504 --> 16:25.723
Only if you leave
the attitude here.

16:27.116 --> 16:28.900
♪ New day, yeah

16:28.944 --> 16:31.425
♪ I'll start all over

16:31.468 --> 16:33.340
♪ I'll start
all over ♪

16:33.383 --> 16:38.258
♪ A new day, a new day...

16:43.524 --> 16:45.874
She's heading deeper
into the courtyard. Kai,

16:45.917 --> 16:47.310
Lucy, cover the entrances.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.443
- Do not let him slip away.
- Copy.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.010
Jesse, Sola,

16:51.053 --> 16:53.664
keep on Maggie,
eyes open for Bao.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.710
We got her, boss.

17:09.811 --> 17:12.248
Actually, we don't got her.

17:13.423 --> 17:14.685
Excuse me.

17:16.861 --> 17:19.212
She doesn't have the
bakery bag anymore.

17:19.255 --> 17:20.604
Must have handed it off.

17:20.648 --> 17:21.823
I got a suspect with the bag.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.477
Blue jeans, green shirt.
Hey!

17:23.520 --> 17:26.088
Don't let him get away.
I'll take Maggie.

17:29.961 --> 17:31.659
It's a message. She's onto us.

17:34.488 --> 17:36.707
Where is he?
Move!

17:38.883 --> 17:40.189
Move! Move!

17:42.539 --> 17:43.975
Oh.

17:48.676 --> 17:49.807
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:50.765 --> 17:53.072
Suspect's heading
towards the water.

17:55.639 --> 17:56.901
Excuse me.

18:11.002 --> 18:13.266
- Federal agents!
- Federal agents!

18:13.309 --> 18:15.181
NCIS!

18:15.224 --> 18:17.008
Drop the knife! Drop it!

18:18.227 --> 18:19.707
We don't have a shot.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.752
- I do.
- Take it!

18:21.796 --> 18:23.537
Janey, don't!

18:29.456 --> 18:30.805
Man, you okay?

18:30.848 --> 18:32.807
Where'd he go?
We lost him.

18:38.639 --> 18:40.075
I'm sorry.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.251
Maggie Shaw,
you are under arrest

18:42.295 --> 18:43.426
for espionage and treason.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.602
Mm-hmm.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.393
This is ridiculous. We should
be out there searching for Bao.

18:53.436 --> 18:55.525
Every law enforcement agent on
the island is looking for him.

18:55.569 --> 18:56.918
Not the two of us, brah.

18:56.961 --> 18:58.833
Wouldn't have mattered.
Bao's gone.

18:58.876 --> 19:01.270
Unbelievable.
But we got a piece of him.

19:01.314 --> 19:03.142
There was blood found
at the scene. He's wounded.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.795
You must have cut him
during your fight.

19:04.839 --> 19:06.319
Means he won't
get far.

19:06.362 --> 19:08.103
No, no, no.
It means he's hurt.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.279
He can still disappear, and
it's all because of your boss.

19:10.323 --> 19:11.846
If it wasn't for Tennant,

19:11.889 --> 19:13.804
we would have never gotten
as close to Bao as we did.

19:13.848 --> 19:15.806
She got Maggie
to draw him out.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.417
And she missed the shot
to take him down, okay?

19:17.460 --> 19:18.809
She's personally involved.

19:18.853 --> 19:20.811
Yeah, well,
she's not the only one.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.987
Hey, I have my reasons.
He's responsible

19:23.031 --> 19:24.641
for the death of my asset,
all right?

19:24.685 --> 19:26.252
Someone that I promised to help.

19:26.295 --> 19:27.818
No, Jesse doesn't mean you.

19:27.862 --> 19:29.472
Maggie could have gotten away,

19:29.516 --> 19:31.474
but she stopped Tennant
from shooting Bao.

19:31.518 --> 19:33.998
Yeah, she sacrificed
herself for him. Why?

19:34.042 --> 19:36.218
So that Bao could
get away, obviously.

19:36.262 --> 19:37.959
We'll find him.

19:38.002 --> 19:40.179
- How?
- By questioning Maggie,

19:40.222 --> 19:42.398
his only contact here
in Hawai'i.

19:42.442 --> 19:43.921
And who's gonna do that?

19:43.965 --> 19:45.445
I am.

19:45.488 --> 19:47.273
You think that's the best idea?

19:47.316 --> 19:49.840
I don't really have a choice.

19:49.884 --> 19:53.104
Look, one of us... Or the FBI.

19:53.148 --> 19:54.323
- Or me.
- Look,

19:54.367 --> 19:56.673
she's not gonna talk
to anyone but me, okay?

19:56.717 --> 19:58.414
It's already been cleared
by the FBI.

19:58.458 --> 20:00.808
There's no debate to be had.

20:08.163 --> 20:09.904
Just like the movies.

20:09.947 --> 20:11.558
When it's your time,
they send your best friend

20:11.601 --> 20:12.950
to take you out.

20:14.952 --> 20:16.432
No jokes,

20:16.476 --> 20:18.217
no small talk, no games.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.522
Oh, Janey,

20:19.566 --> 20:20.871
I taught you better than that.

20:20.915 --> 20:22.960
You've got to build a rapport.

20:23.004 --> 20:24.266
Definitely no teacher-student crap.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.615
So, I imagine

20:25.659 --> 20:27.313
witty banter is out, too?

20:27.356 --> 20:30.620
Why, Maggie? Why did you give
up everything you believe in?

20:30.664 --> 20:32.187
Are they blackmailing you?

20:32.231 --> 20:34.407
You think
you're in control here, Janey.

20:34.450 --> 20:36.235
That I'm at your mercy?

20:36.278 --> 20:38.889
You don't even know what
I've done or why I've done it.

20:38.933 --> 20:41.936
You can make your threats,
you can slam the table,

20:41.979 --> 20:45.548
but you can't compel me
to say a word.

20:47.811 --> 20:49.639
She's right.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.293
We can't
force her to talk.

20:51.337 --> 20:52.555
There's no way she'll
tell us where Bao is.

20:52.599 --> 20:53.991
Then we need to help.

20:54.035 --> 20:56.646
Find some evidence
to get Maggie to spill.

20:56.690 --> 20:58.561
We can't even track
the direction Bao ran in

20:58.605 --> 20:59.954
after the marketplace.

20:59.997 --> 21:02.086
Or explain why
he's still in Hawai'i.

21:02.130 --> 21:05.394
At this point, he's got to be
trying to get off the island.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.048
He's not gonna get far.

21:07.091 --> 21:09.093
Airports and major marinas
are on the lookout for him.

21:09.137 --> 21:11.879
Still plenty of places for him
to get access to a boat.

21:11.922 --> 21:13.881
Sola thinks so, too. He went
out on his own snipe hunt,

21:13.924 --> 21:15.926
looking at
smaller marinas.

21:15.970 --> 21:18.364
Gives him something
to occupy him.

21:18.407 --> 21:20.104
None of this explains why

21:20.148 --> 21:21.410
Bao didn't flee days ago.

21:21.454 --> 21:23.412
What are we missing?

21:23.456 --> 21:25.022
I can't say
what you're missing,

21:25.066 --> 21:28.156
but I can say what's on Maggie's
mystery thumb drive.

21:28.939 --> 21:31.377
Someone's
childhood photos?

21:31.420 --> 21:34.684
We also have videos-- first
birthday, learning to crawl.

21:34.728 --> 21:36.773
I don't get it.
It's got to be some kind

21:36.817 --> 21:38.384
of encryption, right?

21:38.427 --> 21:40.299
Ah, could be coded messages
inside the images.

21:40.342 --> 21:41.735
Steganography?

21:41.778 --> 21:44.477
- Oh, that makes sense.
- This isn't steganography.

21:44.520 --> 21:47.218
It's just somebody's memories.

21:47.262 --> 21:50.700
So, why was it hidden
in Maggie's house?

21:51.484 --> 21:53.747
I'm not the one to ask.

21:54.574 --> 21:57.620
We don't know why she has these
or why they were hidden,

21:57.664 --> 22:00.275
but they clearly mean
a lot to Maggie.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.799
Figured if anyone
knew why, it'd be you.

22:02.843 --> 22:05.585
Jesse, Maggie isn't
who I thought she was.

22:05.628 --> 22:07.587
I don't know what to do.

22:07.630 --> 22:09.763
Sure, you do.

22:09.806 --> 22:12.156
You're gonna tell me
I'm too close.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.854
You are too close,
but like you said,

22:13.897 --> 22:16.160
that's your advantage here.

22:16.204 --> 22:19.686
You know her.

22:27.955 --> 22:29.870
Exactly where I left you this morning.

22:29.913 --> 22:32.873
Did you do
your exercises?

22:32.916 --> 22:35.484
Back and forth
to the kitchen.

22:35.528 --> 22:37.486
172 times.

22:37.530 --> 22:40.794
Changed my dressing
and ate my soup.

22:42.099 --> 22:44.058
And I called home.

22:44.101 --> 22:46.060
Oh. I see.

22:46.103 --> 22:47.844
Don't worry.

22:47.888 --> 22:49.890
I kept it under three minutes.

22:49.933 --> 22:52.196
Didn't give away
any state secrets.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.503
And how was Daniel?

22:55.722 --> 22:57.854
Over being a single dad.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.203
Hmm.

22:59.247 --> 23:01.075
And Alex?

23:01.118 --> 23:04.426
He made me a Mother's Day card
but couldn't send it,

23:04.470 --> 23:08.430
so he described it instead.

23:08.474 --> 23:10.389
Well, that's hard.

23:10.432 --> 23:12.478
Every day without him is hard.

23:12.521 --> 23:15.219
But... Mother's Day.

23:16.786 --> 23:19.049
I'm fine.

23:22.836 --> 23:26.927
You know, I understand.

23:27.710 --> 23:30.017
More than you know.

23:32.323 --> 23:34.978
I had a child.

23:35.022 --> 23:36.893
Many years ago.

23:36.937 --> 23:38.982
I was on assignment in Shandong.

23:39.026 --> 23:42.682
Long-term deep cover.
I was so young.

23:42.725 --> 23:44.814
I fell in love with...

23:44.858 --> 23:48.644
someone I shouldn't have,

23:48.688 --> 23:50.690
and we had a son.

23:50.733 --> 23:55.390
Oh, Janey, he was
magnificent.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.740
But he was not healthy.

23:57.784 --> 24:00.656
He had a rare blood disorder.

24:00.700 --> 24:03.224
We heard about a
specialist in Beijing.

24:03.267 --> 24:06.793
A real miracle worker,
impossible to see.

24:06.836 --> 24:10.840
But a mother
won't be stopped,

24:10.884 --> 24:13.060
so I did get
an appointment.

24:13.103 --> 24:14.409
And what happened?

24:14.453 --> 24:17.630
It was a trap.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.372
MSS set me up.

24:21.416 --> 24:23.462
They took me
into custody,

24:23.505 --> 24:26.334
took my son
and his father.

24:26.377 --> 24:29.119
His father just...

24:29.163 --> 24:31.600
disappeared.

24:33.384 --> 24:35.517
And my son died

24:35.561 --> 24:37.519
before I was returned

24:37.563 --> 24:39.129
to the United States.

24:39.173 --> 24:41.567
Oh, Mags, I'm so sorry.

24:41.610 --> 24:43.786
No, it was
a long time ago.

24:43.830 --> 24:45.962
I've been able
to bury it.

24:46.006 --> 24:48.312
But on Mother's Day,

24:48.356 --> 24:50.314
I like to let him back in.

24:50.358 --> 24:53.840
I like to just imagine
what it would have been like.

24:57.147 --> 25:00.020
It's just a little gift
I give myself.

25:05.678 --> 25:08.507
Round two.

25:11.118 --> 25:12.511
What is she doing?

25:12.554 --> 25:14.991
Taking a chance.

25:15.035 --> 25:17.951
It's just you
and me, Maggie.

25:17.994 --> 25:19.822
No one else.

25:19.866 --> 25:23.565
I know why you're risking
everything for Bao.

25:23.609 --> 25:27.656
It's not about money
or ideology.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.919
Or blackmail.

25:30.790 --> 25:33.053
It's about family.

25:37.231 --> 25:39.973
Bao is your son.

25:50.810 --> 25:52.725
You told me your son died
in a Beijing hospital

25:52.768 --> 25:54.944
while you were
being detained.

25:54.988 --> 25:56.511
That's what they told me.

25:56.555 --> 25:57.817
So what am I missing?

25:57.860 --> 25:59.645
They held me for months.

25:59.688 --> 26:02.212
There was no contact
with the outside world.

26:02.256 --> 26:05.999
I had no idea
where my family was.

26:06.042 --> 26:09.045
The State Department finally
negotiated my release.

26:09.089 --> 26:11.482
When I was on the plane
back home, they told me

26:11.526 --> 26:15.051
that my son
and his father were dead.

26:15.095 --> 26:17.401
No other details.

26:18.272 --> 26:20.927
You must have tried to find out.

26:20.970 --> 26:22.929
Obviously. I reached out
to every contact I had,

26:22.972 --> 26:24.974
but I wasn't allowed
back in China.

26:25.018 --> 26:27.194
And no one was talking.

26:27.237 --> 26:31.459
I had two choices--
I could die with them

26:31.502 --> 26:33.069
or I could move on.

26:33.113 --> 26:35.637
I restarted my career
in counterterrorism,

26:35.681 --> 26:38.814
and I put the past in the past

26:38.858 --> 26:41.208
for 22 years.

26:41.251 --> 26:43.427
And then,

26:43.471 --> 26:46.648
one day, a man
reached out to me.

26:46.692 --> 26:48.650
Chinese,

26:48.694 --> 26:50.217
fully grown.

26:51.697 --> 26:56.310
Janey, from the moment
that I saw him, I just knew.

26:56.353 --> 26:57.703
How?

26:57.746 --> 27:01.141
Come on. A mother knows.

27:01.184 --> 27:03.752
Of course there was a DNA test

27:03.796 --> 27:05.841
and an explanation.

27:05.885 --> 27:08.627
He recovered in the hospital.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.759
He was raised by his
father's family.

27:10.803 --> 27:13.240
They lived in shame
because of me.

27:13.283 --> 27:16.025
They were constantly watched
by the Chinese government.

27:16.069 --> 27:18.158
Denied opportunities.

27:18.201 --> 27:22.249
And then they gave him
the chance to make amends.

27:22.292 --> 27:23.772
You.

27:23.816 --> 27:25.121
Turning a
high-level American

27:25.165 --> 27:28.255
intelligence agent--
that is something.

27:28.298 --> 27:30.474
At first, he didn't
ask for much.

27:30.518 --> 27:33.477
Confirmation of intelligence
that MSS already had.

27:33.521 --> 27:34.914
It was nothing vital.

27:34.957 --> 27:36.480
What do you get in return?

27:36.524 --> 27:39.309
Time with my son.

27:39.353 --> 27:42.704
I thought I could
control it, Janey.

27:42.748 --> 27:46.969
I thought that I could stop
before the asks became too much.

27:47.013 --> 27:50.494
Why didn't you come to me?
To help you?

27:50.538 --> 27:53.541
Oh, Janey, I didn't want
to drag you into it.

27:53.584 --> 27:57.414
I was trying to protect you <i>
and</i> him.

27:57.458 --> 27:58.981
Protect Bao?

27:59.025 --> 28:01.244
One of the most wanted
MSS operatives in the world?

28:01.288 --> 28:03.377
Well, he wasn't Bao
when this started.

28:03.420 --> 28:04.726
No.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.902
You made him.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.557
Why is he still here, Maggie?

28:09.600 --> 28:12.516
With every cop in the state
looking for him,

28:12.560 --> 28:14.518
why doesn't he just leave?

28:14.562 --> 28:17.173
Love of his mother?

28:17.217 --> 28:19.001
It's more than love.

28:19.045 --> 28:20.786
Bao is a top MSS agent.

28:20.829 --> 28:22.265
He didn't get that way
by being sentimental.

28:22.309 --> 28:23.789
He used his relationship
to Maggie

28:23.832 --> 28:25.181
to get high-level intelligence.

28:25.225 --> 28:26.835
And there's no way
that he'd stick around

28:26.879 --> 28:28.837
with his cover blown just
to eat some cake with Mom.

28:28.881 --> 28:30.447
So why is Bao
still here?

28:30.491 --> 28:32.058
He needs something.

28:32.101 --> 28:34.887
Oh, I was wondering where you
went. I wasn't.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.889
I don't agree
with how Tennant

28:36.932 --> 28:38.891
handled everything,
but I'll admit

28:38.934 --> 28:40.980
that going after Maggie
did put Bao in play,

28:41.023 --> 28:42.677
and now he's on the run.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.940
So I took a tour
of the smaller marinas

28:44.984 --> 28:46.637
and docks on the island,

28:46.681 --> 28:49.031
and Bao could easily access
any small boat and leave.

28:49.075 --> 28:51.077
He won't get very far.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.557
Well, not back to China,
bro, but another island.

28:53.601 --> 28:55.908
Fair enough, but it doesn't
- explain what he needs.
- Tribute.

28:55.951 --> 28:57.953
His entire network
has been dismantled.

28:57.997 --> 28:59.563
The golden calf
is in custody.

28:59.607 --> 29:01.478
He needs to bring something
back to his handlers.

29:01.522 --> 29:04.525
- Like an insurance policy.
- What could it be?

29:04.568 --> 29:06.570
I have no idea.

29:06.614 --> 29:08.442
I might.

29:09.312 --> 29:11.053
There was a-a possible
security breach

29:11.097 --> 29:12.881
of the joint intelligence
database

29:12.925 --> 29:15.231
- a year ago.
- What do you mean "possible"?

29:15.275 --> 29:17.581
Well, it could have been
a hiccup in the firewalls.

29:17.625 --> 29:19.061
But for three minutes,

29:19.105 --> 29:21.020
every classified document
stored there was vulnerable.

29:21.063 --> 29:23.849
- An inside job?
- We don't know.

29:23.892 --> 29:25.589
Was there an
- investigation?
- Of course.

29:25.633 --> 29:28.070
But no leads and about
a thousand possible suspects.

29:28.114 --> 29:30.072
Well, it could
have been Maggie.

29:30.116 --> 29:32.988
Yeah, she may have
- had access.
Yeah, we searched

29:33.032 --> 29:35.208
her entire house,
and we found nothing.

29:35.251 --> 29:36.949
Maybe she's not
keeping it at her house.

29:36.992 --> 29:39.821
I've been fine-combing
Maggie's financial life.

29:39.865 --> 29:41.257
Everything's above board.

29:41.301 --> 29:43.129
Teacher's salary,
government pension,

29:43.172 --> 29:46.045
balanced checkbook, and... this.

29:48.308 --> 29:51.441
- What's the Green Kauai Fund?
- Charity.

29:51.485 --> 29:54.793
Set up to clean campsites
and wilderness areas on Kauai.

29:54.836 --> 29:56.620
Tens of thousands
of dollars a year.

29:56.664 --> 29:58.448
That's-that's a lot of cleanup.

29:58.492 --> 30:01.451
Yes and no, considering she's
the only donor to the charity.

30:01.495 --> 30:04.280
A charity that has no employees,
no track record.

30:04.324 --> 30:06.326
Only a P.O. box
and a basic website.

30:06.369 --> 30:11.461
And a trailer set up in
a remote section of the island.

30:11.505 --> 30:13.202
It's a safe house.

30:13.246 --> 30:15.901
Good place to stash
an insurance policy.

30:15.944 --> 30:18.512
Go there now.
If we're right, Bao will, too.

30:25.214 --> 30:26.955
Wow.

30:26.999 --> 30:29.828
Been gone a few months
on maternity leave,

30:29.871 --> 30:31.612
and you really
spruced up the place.

30:31.655 --> 30:33.657
Well, this was always
a temporary assignment.

30:33.701 --> 30:35.659
I'm happy to move on.

30:35.703 --> 30:37.792
Are we going back to Pakistan?

30:37.836 --> 30:41.448
Actually, I am moving to the
other side of the building.

30:41.491 --> 30:45.147
Far East Division, but
beggars, choosers, right?

30:45.191 --> 30:47.846
I don't know anything
about China.

30:47.889 --> 30:49.848
You don't need to.

30:52.763 --> 30:54.243
What's that?

30:54.287 --> 30:55.854
Do you remember
the NCIS agent

30:55.897 --> 30:57.464
who worked the
operation in Kabul?

30:57.507 --> 31:01.337
With the Marine haircut
and that snarky sidekick?

31:01.381 --> 31:03.557
You made quite an impression
on him.

31:03.600 --> 31:04.993
How can you tell?

31:05.037 --> 31:07.082
Because he tried
to steal you from me.

31:07.126 --> 31:09.258
He asked me to give you this.

31:15.090 --> 31:18.702
"Rule 72. Always be open
to new ideas."

31:18.746 --> 31:20.095
What does that mean?

31:20.139 --> 31:22.097
Oh, I don't know.
He has dozens of them.

31:22.141 --> 31:25.840
But he's good people, and he can
get you set up with FLETC.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.408
To be a Navy cop? No, thanks.

31:28.451 --> 31:31.367
Janey, it's a good move for you.
You would train stateside.

31:31.411 --> 31:35.197
You'd have more control
over your career.

31:35.241 --> 31:38.113
You'd be with Daniel and
those two beautiful babies.

31:38.157 --> 31:39.636
But I already have a job.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.160
And a family.

31:41.203 --> 31:43.162
You say you love
them both,

31:43.205 --> 31:45.294
and you wish you
didn't have to choose.

31:45.338 --> 31:47.122
Well, darling,
here is your solution.

31:47.166 --> 31:49.255
Did I upset you somehow?

31:49.298 --> 31:52.911
Oh, God, no.
You've been essential.

31:52.954 --> 31:55.000
And I have
been selfish.

31:55.043 --> 31:58.960
You have a family.
Go be with them.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.962
I can make
my own life decisions.

32:01.006 --> 32:02.964
Yes, of courseyou can.

32:03.008 --> 32:05.227
And I need to make mine, too.

32:06.576 --> 32:09.840
This part of my life
I have to do alone.

32:11.494 --> 32:15.585
I almost lost you once.
I won't do it again.

32:15.629 --> 32:18.153
So, go.
Please go,

32:18.197 --> 32:22.201
and... solve Navy crimes.

32:23.332 --> 32:25.813
Just get yourself as far away
from here as you can.

32:30.122 --> 32:32.776
You convinced me
to take this job ten years ago.

32:32.820 --> 32:34.778
Leave CIA.

32:34.822 --> 32:36.519
You said
it would save my family.

32:36.563 --> 32:37.781
I was right.

32:37.825 --> 32:39.218
Mostly.

32:39.261 --> 32:41.002
You wanted me out of your hair.

32:41.046 --> 32:42.699
You wanted me gone.

32:42.743 --> 32:44.266
And why would I want that?

32:44.310 --> 32:46.616
Because you decided
to cooperate with Bao,

32:46.660 --> 32:47.966
become a double agent,

32:48.009 --> 32:49.968
and worried
I'd figure it out.

32:50.011 --> 32:52.448
I wasn't worried
that you'd discover me.

32:52.492 --> 32:55.799
I was worried
that you'd get caught up in it.

32:55.843 --> 32:58.019
And that when
the end came,

32:58.063 --> 32:59.934
you would go down, too.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.849
Well, we've reached the end,
Maggie.

33:01.892 --> 33:05.853
And I'm glad that you're the one
on the other side of this table.

33:07.115 --> 33:09.074
You've been stalling.

33:09.117 --> 33:11.032
Giving Bao a chance
to get whatever

33:11.076 --> 33:13.730
insurance policy you set up
and escape.

33:13.774 --> 33:16.907
- Time is all I got left.
- Fair enough.

33:16.951 --> 33:19.475
You've got nothing
but time.

33:20.694 --> 33:22.652
Bao, on the other hand,

33:22.696 --> 33:25.481
is about to run out of it.

33:25.525 --> 33:29.181
Okay, patched
into the drone feed.

33:52.334 --> 33:54.728
You're pretty pleased
with yourself.

33:55.511 --> 33:58.036
I think you're pretty
pleased with me, too.

33:58.079 --> 33:59.602
You know, solving
your case and all?

33:59.646 --> 34:01.213
We got eyes on Bao.

34:01.256 --> 34:03.780
He's about to head
inside the trailer.

34:03.824 --> 34:05.695
We got him, Maggie. It's done.

34:05.739 --> 34:08.133
And judging by the fight
he put up at the Ilikai market,

34:08.176 --> 34:10.918
he's probably not gonna
make it out of here alive.

34:18.926 --> 34:21.189
Waiting on your word, boss.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.812
On my command.

34:40.208 --> 34:42.254
We're ready.

34:42.297 --> 34:43.733
What's the play?

34:43.777 --> 34:45.387
Janey, tell them
to stand down.

34:45.431 --> 34:47.476
- No way we're letting him go.
- He's not...

34:47.520 --> 34:49.478
- You can't hurt him.
- You put him here.

34:49.522 --> 34:51.741
You're responsible
for what happens next.

34:51.785 --> 34:54.135
- You don't understand.
- Bao is a killer.

34:54.179 --> 34:55.180
He's not Bao.

35:01.925 --> 35:03.884
You guys hear that?
Sounds like a vehicle.

35:03.927 --> 35:07.148
Yeah. We got a bogey
coming in. Single driver.

35:07.192 --> 35:08.193
He's armed.

35:08.236 --> 35:09.455
Ticktock, Maggie.

35:09.498 --> 35:11.152
I'm the one you want.

35:11.196 --> 35:13.502
I am Bao.

35:15.417 --> 35:17.637
Guys, be ready
to take down both.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.421
I'm telling you the truth.

35:19.465 --> 35:20.857
<i>Every operation,</i> <i>
every data breach--</i>

35:20.901 --> 35:23.208
<i>he couldn't have done it</i> <i>
without me.</i>

35:23.251 --> 35:24.426
But he did do it.

35:24.470 --> 35:25.949
Every operation,
every asset

35:25.993 --> 35:28.561
that was compromised
and killed-- it's on him.

35:28.604 --> 35:31.999
It's on me!
But I can help you.

35:32.042 --> 35:34.654
I can make repairs
if you let him go.

35:38.701 --> 35:40.181
You want me to let him go?

35:40.225 --> 35:42.314
With whatever he's so anxious to
get in that trailer?

35:42.357 --> 35:43.663
It's a document dump

35:43.706 --> 35:45.708
from the joint intelligence
database.

35:45.752 --> 35:47.710
- Get specific.
- It's NOC lists.

35:47.754 --> 35:50.670
It's safe house locations,
operational protocols.

35:50.713 --> 35:53.803
Little more
than a document dump.

35:53.847 --> 35:56.415
I can give it
all to you.

35:56.458 --> 35:58.330
You can use it against MSS.

35:58.373 --> 36:00.070
I will cooperate fully.

36:00.114 --> 36:03.204
<i>He's no longer a threat</i> <i>
if I'm with you.</i>

36:03.248 --> 36:04.858
Jeep's about
to make contact with Bao.

36:04.901 --> 36:06.338
We need the green light.

36:06.381 --> 36:09.471
Please. He's all I have.

36:19.046 --> 36:21.440
Yeah, boss.

36:33.452 --> 36:35.497
Stand down.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.760
I repeat, stand down.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.510
And this is an affidavit stating

36:48.554 --> 36:50.599
you will cooperate freely
and of your own will

36:50.643 --> 36:52.166
with the government's
investigation

36:52.210 --> 36:54.864
of your treasonous acts.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.441
Can I have the room, please?

37:10.140 --> 37:13.753
I'm being transferred
to an undisclosed location.

37:13.796 --> 37:16.495
I'm hoping for someplace warm.

37:18.932 --> 37:22.936
Yeah, I didn't think you'd want
to talk, so I asked them

37:22.979 --> 37:25.373
if I could write you this.

37:32.119 --> 37:34.295
You broke my heart, Maggie.

37:35.165 --> 37:38.343
I know, Janey.

37:50.398 --> 37:52.357
She's all yours.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.359
You might want to analyze this.

37:54.402 --> 37:57.623
Don't you want
- to read it first?
- No.

37:57.666 --> 38:00.278
I'm done with Maggie Shaw.

38:03.672 --> 38:05.718
Maggie Shaw

38:05.761 --> 38:07.850
is in FBI custody. They're
taking her to the mainland.

38:07.894 --> 38:11.550
Yeah, she's agreed to give up
every detail she has about MSS.

38:11.593 --> 38:13.639
All the operations
she ran for them.

38:13.682 --> 38:16.294
How's Tennant?
Anyone check in?

38:16.337 --> 38:18.774
Yeah, I saw her
in the lobby. She's, uh,

38:18.818 --> 38:20.863
not in a check-in kind of mood.

38:20.907 --> 38:24.171
She just sent her best friend to prison for life.

38:24.214 --> 38:27.305
Probably gonna need a beat
before she can talk about it.

38:27.348 --> 38:29.002
She'll be okay.

38:29.045 --> 38:31.265
She's strong.
Yeah.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.049
It's Bao, though.

38:33.093 --> 38:34.747
I'm still not comfortable
letting him go

38:34.790 --> 38:36.314
with all that
classified intel.

38:36.357 --> 38:37.750
Have faith, man.

38:37.793 --> 38:40.274
The virus I installed
on his insurance policy

38:40.318 --> 38:42.798
is gonna cause MSS
a lot of pain.

38:42.842 --> 38:44.670
Mm-hmm, plus

38:44.713 --> 38:47.368
we got our own
insurance policy.

39:02.035 --> 39:04.559
Don't worry about it... Thank you.

39:28.931 --> 39:32.282
Oh. She's gotten so big.

39:32.326 --> 39:34.763
Well, we haven't seen you
in a while.

39:34.807 --> 39:36.896
No. Everyone's
been so busy,

39:36.939 --> 39:41.422
and you've got a new
house and a new job.

39:41.466 --> 39:44.382
And I have got new...

39:44.425 --> 39:46.471
just news.

39:46.514 --> 39:48.560
You're leaving, aren't you?

39:48.603 --> 39:51.301
Yes, but it's not
what you think.

39:51.345 --> 39:53.913
I am retiring.

39:53.956 --> 39:55.915
That doesn't sound like you.

39:55.958 --> 39:57.438
Well, it's true.

39:57.482 --> 40:00.049
I've got a <i>job</i> job.

40:00.093 --> 40:01.921
I'm lecturing

40:01.964 --> 40:05.707
at UH-- current events
and political science.

40:05.751 --> 40:07.317
Hawai'i?

40:07.361 --> 40:09.450
I know, it's a hardship,

40:09.494 --> 40:12.192
but I'll just
have to endure.

40:12.235 --> 40:14.586
- So that's it, huh?
- Yeah.

40:14.629 --> 40:17.632
- No more cloak and dagger?
- Oh, well,

40:17.676 --> 40:20.374
I'll consult with the Company
if I can be of use.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.681
It's just so far away.

40:22.724 --> 40:25.466
- Don't be sad.
- No, I'm happy for you.

40:25.510 --> 40:28.295
Just disappointed for her.

40:29.818 --> 40:33.431
You're the type of woman
she should grow up to be.

40:36.651 --> 40:38.610
Well, I'll be around, darling.

40:38.653 --> 40:41.613
I just needed a change,
that's all.

40:41.656 --> 40:43.615
You want to talk about it?

40:43.658 --> 40:46.618
With a Navy cop? No.

40:46.661 --> 40:50.665
But I do want to hold
this magnificent creature.

40:51.536 --> 40:54.669
Hey, say, "Hi, Auntie Maggie."

40:54.713 --> 40:56.845
Hi, you.

40:56.889 --> 40:59.718
Oh, my gosh.

40:59.761 --> 41:01.676
Wow.

41:01.720 --> 41:05.201
I'm so proud of you, Janey.

41:05.245 --> 41:07.465
Thank you.

41:09.249 --> 41:11.947
Mom! Mom!

41:11.991 --> 41:14.515
Mom.

41:14.559 --> 41:17.126
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:17.170 --> 41:18.824
I've been calling.

41:18.867 --> 41:21.870
Oh, I'm...

41:21.914 --> 41:23.872
sorry.

41:23.916 --> 41:25.526
I must have...

41:25.570 --> 41:26.919
Tried Maggie, too,

41:26.962 --> 41:28.660
'cause we thought
you might be with her,

41:28.703 --> 41:31.314
but her, like,
phone's disconnected.

41:31.358 --> 41:34.448
Is everything okay?

41:34.492 --> 41:37.538
With us, yeah.
How about you?

41:42.325 --> 41:44.545
I'm...

41:47.896 --> 41:50.943
Did something happen
to Aunt Maggie?

41:54.729 --> 41:57.515
She won't be
coming around anymore.

41:57.558 --> 42:00.387
- She okay?
- Yeah.

42:00.430 --> 42:03.695
I think so. I...

42:07.307 --> 42:09.527
Are you all right?

42:10.353 --> 42:13.052
No, baby,

42:13.095 --> 42:15.097
I'm really... I'm really not.

42:15.141 --> 42:18.797
Mom, it's okay.

42:20.276 --> 42:22.409
It's okay, Mom. It's okay.

42:22.452 --> 42:27.675
You're gonna be okay.
