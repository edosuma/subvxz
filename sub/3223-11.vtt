00:03.600 --> 00:04.806
Charlie Bradbury.

00:04.960 --> 00:06.291
- Unh.
- Jeez!

00:06.480 --> 00:09.165
I erase the drive first,
then I go back to my old life?

00:09.360 --> 00:11.169
You don't have an old life anymore.

00:11.360 --> 00:13.727
Never contact me again. Like, ever.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.609
If you stay, I would be with you.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.201
But if you leave, don't come back.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.328
Whatever you decide...

00:20.920 --> 00:22.729
...decide.

00:24.240 --> 00:25.366
Listen, Benny...

00:25.520 --> 00:28.729
...everything you've done for me,
I will never forget.

00:28.920 --> 00:30.604
But, uh...

00:30.840 --> 00:32.125
End of the line?

00:32.320 --> 00:33.367
AdiÃ³s.

00:46.120 --> 00:48.282
How dare you?

00:48.480 --> 00:49.811
Lance.

00:49.960 --> 00:53.442
Yeah, that's right,
I'm talking to Lance, not...

00:53.600 --> 00:55.887
Oh, no, we both cut corners
to get close to her.

00:56.040 --> 00:57.804
But that wasn't cheating.

00:57.960 --> 00:59.291
Dude.

00:59.440 --> 01:02.125
It's just a game.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.522
It's just a game.

01:43.240 --> 01:46.289
Help!

01:46.440 --> 01:48.249
Help me!

02:03.440 --> 02:05.408
They say that the father's insane

02:06.440 --> 02:09.603
And dear Mrs. Perkin's a game

02:10.919 --> 02:12.160
We're talkin' 'bout...

02:12.360 --> 02:14.203
You okay, man?

02:16.920 --> 02:19.764
We have the most powerful weapon
we've had against demons...

02:19.920 --> 02:22.207
...and we can't find a way to use it.

02:22.360 --> 02:26.126
Yeah, well, Kevin's on it,
and when he finds something, he'll call.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.123
So we wait.

02:30.960 --> 02:36.091
Look, we have both had a rough go
over these past couple of weeks...

02:37.120 --> 02:39.361
...and I know what you gave up
wasn't easy.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.963
Maybe we ought to take the night off.

02:43.480 --> 02:46.051
Go see a flick. Hit a bar. Or two.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.085
Have some fun.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.686
You remember fun, don't you, Sammy?

02:58.520 --> 03:00.284
Kevin, what do you got?

03:00.480 --> 03:02.482
Garth, hey.

03:03.280 --> 03:05.681
Really? Okay. Yeah.

03:05.840 --> 03:09.526
Thanks, man. Oh, hey. Hey, Garth.
Garth, you there?

03:09.800 --> 03:12.531
How did you know where we are?

03:13.280 --> 03:15.567
Look, it's bad enough
that you're tracking us...

03:15.720 --> 03:19.850
...but it's even worse
when you say we've been Garthed.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.923
Ahem. Yeah.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.248
Okay. We gotta lose the GPS
on our phones...

03:24.400 --> 03:27.768
...because Garth has been tracking us
and other hunters, apparently...

03:27.920 --> 03:29.445
...to assign cases.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.005
I mean, that's smart.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.605
A total Bobby move.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.844
What's the deal?

03:35.360 --> 03:38.250
Uh, well, it's close.
Farmington Hills, Michigan.

03:38.440 --> 03:41.284
Dude got ripped limb from limb
inside his locked apartment.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.124
That's not good.

03:43.320 --> 03:44.731
Working a case.

03:44.880 --> 03:48.282
As long as we're waiting on Kevin,
that'll be our fun.

03:56.120 --> 04:00.409
Sheriff, Special Agent Taggart.
This is my partner, Special Agent Rosewood.

04:00.560 --> 04:04.565
FBI? You guys are quick.
Haven't even got the body out yet.

04:04.760 --> 04:07.604
Well, the FBI is all work, no play.

04:07.760 --> 04:10.127
Give me the tour
while my partner looks around.

04:10.280 --> 04:11.691
I work better on my own.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.690
Your world, agent. Follow me.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.330
Vic's name was Ed Nelson,
31 years old.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.448
An insurance claim adjuster.

04:28.600 --> 04:33.561
He lived alone, which is a real shocker
considering his place is full of toys.

04:35.640 --> 04:38.405
- So, what happened?
- No sign of forced entry.

04:38.560 --> 04:42.360
Near as we can tell,
he was tied up and pulled apart.

04:42.880 --> 04:46.965
Died of the shock or massive blood loss.
Dealer's choice on that one.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.249
- So, what about these chains?
- That's actually chain mail.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.528
- Seriously'?
- Heh.

04:52.680 --> 04:57.163
We did find clear rope-burn marks
on his wrists and ankles.

05:05.360 --> 05:06.600
Huh.

05:08.240 --> 05:13.280
So anything missing from the body?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.809
You mean aside from the arms and legs?

05:18.040 --> 05:22.125
Uh... Nope. All there.
Twig and berries too.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.362
What about the neighbors?
They hear anything weird?

05:24.520 --> 05:28.320
Ah, neighbor downstairs got woke up
in the middle of the night...

05:28.480 --> 05:31.529
...by the sound of horses
stomping their feet and galloping.

05:32.560 --> 05:35.166
We didn't find any hoof prints.

05:35.320 --> 05:37.209
She probably heard a TV...

05:37.360 --> 05:40.364
...or was having a bad dream,
or she was high as balls.

05:40.920 --> 05:44.686
Fortunately, we got a real lead
off his cell phone.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.569
According to the phone records...

05:46.720 --> 05:50.566
...Ed's last call was from a guy
called Lance Jacobsen.

05:51.160 --> 05:55.768
An accountant.
Also 30s, also lives alone.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.126
How's he a lead?

05:57.280 --> 05:59.647
The two of them talked together
for 15 minutes...

05:59.800 --> 06:03.691
...and then Lance sent Ed here
all kinds of angry texts.

06:03.880 --> 06:07.965
Some of them were your typical threat
stuff, but some were a little weird.

06:08.480 --> 06:09.561
Weird how?

06:09.760 --> 06:14.607
Like, uh, "You shall bleed
for your crimes against us."

06:14.760 --> 06:16.922
Followed by the emoticon of a skull.

06:17.600 --> 06:22.811
And this beauty:
"I am a mage. I will destroy you."

06:22.960 --> 06:27.807
These kids today
with their texting and murder. Tsk.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.804
My men just brought Lance
into the station for questioning.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.528
We need to take first crack
at the suspect.

06:33.680 --> 06:36.445
Like I said, agent, it's your world.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.008
Lance Jacobsen?

06:44.200 --> 06:46.123
We're with the FBI.

06:46.280 --> 06:47.884
The FBI?

06:48.040 --> 06:50.850
I can't believe this is happening.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.721
I can't believe Ed's dead.

06:56.360 --> 06:59.250
Lance. Lance. Just breathe.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.201
Just breathe. You're fine.

07:02.920 --> 07:05.890
We just need to ask you a few questions.
Try to calm down.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.811
We wanna know about the texts...

07:09.960 --> 07:12.691
- ...you sent Ed last night.
- I told them.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.969
- Those texts weren't from me.
- Your phone and Ed's say otherwise.

07:16.160 --> 07:19.084
No, I mean, they were from me,
but they weren't from "me" me.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.006
Did you really think that sentence
was gonna clear things up?

07:26.640 --> 07:29.644
I'm sorry.
This is all a big misunderstanding.

07:30.160 --> 07:33.084
Those text messages
were from Greyfox the Mystic...

07:33.240 --> 07:34.844
...to Thargrim the Difficult.

07:37.240 --> 07:38.685
Our characters in Moondoor.

07:40.240 --> 07:43.562
Moondoor is a game that Ed and I play.
We're LARPers.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.000
Live-action role playing.

07:45.760 --> 07:49.082
Right. LARPing. Good times.

07:49.280 --> 07:53.285
We play Moondoor at Heritage Park.
All the info about it is on our website.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.685
- You have a website?
- One of the players designed it.

07:56.840 --> 08:00.526
In fact, they should have posted pictures
from last night's feast.

08:00.680 --> 08:01.761
I was there all night.

08:01.920 --> 08:04.810
What does any of this
have to do with the texts?

08:05.280 --> 08:07.647
I play a character
named Greyfox the Mystic.

08:07.840 --> 08:11.287
I'm a very, very powerful mage
in the game.

08:15.080 --> 08:18.050
Okay. Uh, very powerful. Go on.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.565
Ed is...

08:20.840 --> 08:25.482
Ed was Thargrim the Difficult
of the Elder Forest...

08:25.640 --> 08:28.610
...son of Hargrim and Bouphin,
brother to...

08:32.600 --> 08:34.727
He was Lancelot to my Merlin.

08:35.480 --> 08:36.765
Ah.

08:36.919 --> 08:39.605
If you were so tight,
then why the threatening messages?

08:39.799 --> 08:41.802
We were named
to the Queen's Honor Guard...

08:41.960 --> 08:45.123
...in anticipation of the coming
Battle of Kingdoms this weekend.

08:45.320 --> 08:48.164
I thought he broke protocol.
I called Ed after game hours...

08:48.320 --> 08:49.845
...and accused him of cheating.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.367
- And then I challenged him to a duel.
- A duel?

08:52.520 --> 08:54.204
Wands and swords at dawn.

08:56.040 --> 09:00.284
Ahem. Now, when you say wands,
do you mean magic wands?

09:00.440 --> 09:03.284
No, unmagic wands, agent.

09:03.440 --> 09:06.683
Because what I really want in a duel
is an unmagic wand.

09:08.560 --> 09:11.723
Yes, fake wands. It's a game.

09:12.840 --> 09:14.569
I can't believe it.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.449
Oh, ye gods.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.131
Thargrim the Difficult has fallen.

09:24.200 --> 09:25.531
Look, Lance, it's...

09:26.240 --> 09:28.402
Hang in there, champ.

09:32.720 --> 09:36.805
So? You believe Dungeons & Dragons?

09:36.960 --> 09:40.089
He didn't put a whammy on us.
Those weren't crocodile tears, man.

09:40.240 --> 09:42.402
- That's not our guy.
- What are we looking at?

09:42.600 --> 09:43.726
You saw the chain mail.

09:43.880 --> 09:47.089
This could be Fifty Shades of Greyfox
for all we know.

09:47.240 --> 09:51.643
All right, let's check out the Moondoor
site, see if Lance's story checks out.

09:59.960 --> 10:03.089
"Welcome to Moondoor,
Michigan's largest LARPing game."

10:03.240 --> 10:06.005
- And I thought we needed to get out more.
- Heh.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.365
Hmm.

10:10.520 --> 10:12.409
There's our guy.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.206
Huh.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.601
Actually looks kind of awesome.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.925
All right. There's a video.

10:20.080 --> 10:25.007
Moondoor,
a world of intrigue, honor and passion.

10:27.320 --> 10:28.970
Four kingdoms:

10:29.120 --> 10:30.963
the Followers of the Moon...

10:31.120 --> 10:32.201
...Elves...

10:32.440 --> 10:34.442
Warriors of Yesteryear...

10:34.600 --> 10:36.170
...and the dreaded Shadow Orcs.

10:36.360 --> 10:41.161
All will fight on the Fields of Never
in the biannual Battle of Kingdoms.

10:41.320 --> 10:45.769
Pick up a sword or a mace
and take control of Moondoor...

10:45.920 --> 10:48.571
- ...or defend the current ruler...
- Wait, is that...?

10:48.720 --> 10:51.769
...The Queen of Moons.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.962
The hell?

11:34.760 --> 11:37.206
You're gonna wanna see this.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.369
God forbid he was contagious.

11:58.520 --> 12:00.887
I'm gonna go dip myself
in hand sanitizer.

12:03.920 --> 12:08.562
No EMF, no hex bags, no sulfur.
I got nada. You?

12:08.720 --> 12:10.688
Watch the video again.

12:11.360 --> 12:12.850
There. See that?

12:14.200 --> 12:16.248
Same as Ed's. I don't know.

12:16.400 --> 12:20.200
Maybe they had matching tattoos.
I mean, they were brothers-in-arms.

12:20.360 --> 12:23.045
- You recognize it from anything?
- A Tim Burton movie?

12:23.520 --> 12:25.568
Aside from the mark of the creepy here...

12:25.760 --> 12:28.764
...the only thing these guys have
in common is LARPing.

12:28.920 --> 12:30.684
Lucky for us, we know the queen.

12:50.680 --> 12:53.445
I, Boltar the Furious,
bind you to this stock...

12:53.600 --> 12:57.491
...so that all of Moondoor may see you
for what you are, a thief.

12:57.640 --> 13:01.725
My Shadow Orc brethren will descend
from the Black Hills and the tents of...

13:03.360 --> 13:05.806
Uh, hold.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.447
- Thanks, Gerry. Sorry.
- Yeah, no problem, Monty.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.440
Resume.

13:18.600 --> 13:22.764
And the tents will be bathed in blood
as we unseat the Queen of the Moons...

13:22.920 --> 13:26.925
...from the throne she stole from the
rightful heir, the Shadow King, and you...

13:27.080 --> 13:30.323
Silentium.
Serve your time with honor, heathen.

13:30.840 --> 13:35.448
And if you need to use the chamber pot,
stomp your feet thrice.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.843
Excuse me. Hi.
You are a LARPer, yeah?

13:39.040 --> 13:41.327
I prefer the term
"interactive literaturist."

13:41.480 --> 13:45.849
Right. I'm Special Agent Rosewood.
This is Special Agent Taggart.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.126
- We just want...
- Hold.

13:48.440 --> 13:50.329
We're not doing the genre mash-up thing.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.209
We only do that every third month.

13:52.360 --> 13:53.691
- The...
- Come again?

13:54.360 --> 13:57.364
Your fake badges, the cheap suits.
It's very cool. I get it.

13:57.560 --> 14:00.245
Your characters are FBI agents
that traveled to Moondoor.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.522
But it's straight-up Moondoor
this weekend.

14:02.680 --> 14:03.727
These aren't fake badges.

14:03.880 --> 14:07.043
Uh, yeah, they are, and
they're very good...

14:07.240 --> 14:10.403
...but, well, the ID numbers shifted
to 10 digits...

14:10.560 --> 14:12.767
...with two letters at the end of the year.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.685
And that seal is from last month.
Really good work.

14:15.840 --> 14:18.446
It's just it's a tournament weekend,
okay, guys?

14:18.640 --> 14:22.167
So you gotta follow the rules.
If there's no rules, chaos.

14:23.480 --> 14:27.565
Ahem. Resume. If you would like
to join the army of Moons...

14:27.760 --> 14:29.922
...the queen is on the lookout for squires.

14:30.080 --> 14:33.971
Yes. Right. We would like
to see your queen. Now, please.

14:34.160 --> 14:36.162
The queen's calendar is booked up
in advance.

14:36.320 --> 14:39.529
But if you wish to witness
what's in store for you in her army...

14:39.680 --> 14:43.241
...Her Highness is overseeing
new squires on the pitch as we speak.

14:57.280 --> 14:58.691
Yield! I yield!

15:06.080 --> 15:08.606
- I love you.
- I know.

15:08.800 --> 15:12.930
Take your leave to my medical tent
and attend to your severed limbs.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.203
Greyfox and Thargrim are missing.

15:17.960 --> 15:21.442
We pray to the goddess
they have not fallen victim of foul play.

15:21.600 --> 15:24.763
In their absence,
the Honor Guard's ranks are weakened.

15:24.920 --> 15:26.046
To join...

15:29.200 --> 15:30.406
Oh, blerg.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.690
Uh...

15:34.720 --> 15:36.848
The queen needs some royal we time.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.646
Talk amongst thyselves.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.609
Ahem. Nice balance.

15:47.960 --> 15:50.122
- Dude.
- Yeah.

15:52.760 --> 15:53.886
Charlie?

15:54.040 --> 15:55.849
Charlie Bradbury is dead.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.287
She died a year ago. You killed her.

15:58.440 --> 16:01.125
My name is Carrie Heinlein.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.089
Oh, and guess what.

16:03.240 --> 16:04.446
Now you killed her too.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.683
- Okay. Listen...
- No, I buried myself.

16:07.840 --> 16:10.286
Dick Roman went down,
his company belly up...

16:10.440 --> 16:12.761
...and I figured, hey, it's all good.

16:12.920 --> 16:15.764
And I was fine. I got my life back.

16:16.680 --> 16:19.684
Now you're here. And if you guys are here,
monsters are here.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.811
Why do I have such bad luck?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.810
What am I?
Some kind of monster magnet?

16:26.520 --> 16:29.091
Is there such a thing
as a monster magnet?

16:29.280 --> 16:32.124
You know what? Don't answer that.
I don't care.

16:32.280 --> 16:36.683
What I care about is not getting
my other arm broken. Or dying.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.966
So I'm dropping my sword
and walking off the stage, bitches.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.930
Have fun storming the castle.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.923
Charlie. Charlie.

16:47.560 --> 16:50.848
Greyfox and Thargrim? Ed and Lance.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.365
They're not missing.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.047
They're dead.

16:57.880 --> 17:00.486
Drawn and quartered and bleeding out?

17:00.640 --> 17:02.290
Please stop talking again.

17:02.440 --> 17:05.204
So, what do you think did this?

17:05.359 --> 17:08.045
Well, aside from the mark
and them both being LARPers...

17:08.200 --> 17:09.964
...there's not much else to go on.

17:10.119 --> 17:13.442
Wait, I've seen this before.
It's a Celtic magic symbol.

17:14.520 --> 17:18.002
At least it was in my favorite video game.
Does that help? Can I go now?

17:18.160 --> 17:20.446
It's a start. But no. Um...

17:20.640 --> 17:23.211
Listen, what can you tell us
about Ed and Lance?

17:24.400 --> 17:28.405
Good guys. Two of the best members
of the queen's ever-shrinking army.

17:28.560 --> 17:29.925
Ever-shrinking?

17:30.080 --> 17:32.686
My kingdom has had a lot
of bad luck lately.

17:32.840 --> 17:37.926
Probably because of me,
but maybe it's tied to this.

17:38.360 --> 17:41.250
A month ago, one of my guys
had both her ankles broken before a battle.

17:41.400 --> 17:45.450
Before that, I had three people
have hospital-worthy accidents at home.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.841
You think there's any connection there?

17:48.400 --> 17:50.243
They have any enemies in common?

17:50.400 --> 17:53.006
In real life? No.
Everyone gets along famously.

17:53.160 --> 17:56.369
In the game, though?
They had tons of enemies.

17:56.520 --> 17:59.126
Red reps the Followers of the Moon,
my peeps.

17:59.280 --> 18:01.851
Green's for Elves.
Blue's for Warriors of Yesteryear.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.004
And black's for Shadow Orcs.
Total D-bags.

18:05.600 --> 18:09.241
This weekend is the Battle of Kingdoms,
to see who wears the Forever Crown.

18:09.440 --> 18:14.321
This weekend, each faction
is definitely an enemy of me and mine.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.529
You know, if you move your archers back...

18:17.680 --> 18:20.490
- ...and broad swordsmen to the west...
- Oh. Flank the warriors.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.005
- Yep. Thanks.
- Good call.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.440
- The southern wall?
- Guys.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.807
Yeah. Right. Sorry.

18:25.960 --> 18:29.043
So maybe someone from one
of the other kingdoms...

18:29.200 --> 18:32.010
...got ahold of real magic
and started using it.

18:32.160 --> 18:35.403
But why not just come after me?
And why the escalation?

18:35.560 --> 18:37.927
All right.
We will canvass the kingdoms.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.606
- Get out of here. We don't want you hurt.
- Wait.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.848
Charlie knows Moondoor better.
We need her.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.731
Sam, we can take care of accountants
with foam swords.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.888
We need help, Dean. People are dying.

18:48.040 --> 18:51.601
My point is, she should get somewhere
safe and get back to a normal life.

18:51.760 --> 18:54.923
- Hey. I am right here and I want to leave.
- Thank you.

18:57.280 --> 18:59.248
But the queen?

18:59.800 --> 19:00.926
She has to stay.

19:01.080 --> 19:04.129
Sam is right. People are dying.
That can't happen on my watch.

19:04.280 --> 19:07.284
And you know what?
I am tired of running.

19:08.720 --> 19:09.960
I like my life here.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.090
I'm gonna stay and fight for it.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.205
Yeah?

19:22.440 --> 19:24.044
Okay.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.326
Thanks.

19:25.480 --> 19:28.882
So the toxicology report came back
on Lance. Nothing.

19:29.040 --> 19:32.169
But the medical examiner
said his body showed clear signs...

19:32.320 --> 19:34.163
...that he was killed by belladonna.

19:34.320 --> 19:36.322
The porn star?

19:39.480 --> 19:40.970
The poison.

19:41.120 --> 19:42.451
Oh.

19:43.800 --> 19:47.691
Um, however, they couldn't find
a trace of it in his system.

19:47.840 --> 19:51.049
Just like they couldn't find ropes
in Ed's apartment.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.328
Charlie, I'm gonna need
to borrow your laptop.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.963
There are no laptops in Moondoor.

19:56.120 --> 20:00.045
What? There are rules.
But there is a tech tent four tents down.

20:00.560 --> 20:02.642
Okay. How about you guys go canvass...

20:02.840 --> 20:07.687
...and I'll dig into these accidents
and this mark?

20:08.840 --> 20:11.844
Okay, I'm gonna need the full wiki
on where you guys have been.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.810
But first, you're gonna
have to ditch the suit...

20:15.000 --> 20:17.401
...if you're gonna walk and talk
with the queen.

20:37.040 --> 20:40.203
Excuse me, do you know
if there's a directory of online players?

20:40.360 --> 20:44.206
Yeah, it's on the website.
All you need is an account to access it.

20:44.360 --> 20:47.489
- Uh, thanks. Uh...?
- Maria.

20:47.680 --> 20:52.129
I mean, Gholandria the Wicked.

21:00.240 --> 21:03.881
You sent Sam a phantom text
from his ex?

21:04.040 --> 21:07.362
- Dick move, sir.
- Yeah. Not my finest hour.

21:08.440 --> 21:10.966
So he found some normalcy
with this chick...

21:11.160 --> 21:14.562
...and now it's gone. Again.
Thanks to you.

21:15.960 --> 21:19.760
Yeah, well, now he's more committed
than ever, so there's that.

21:20.640 --> 21:24.565
But, trust me, this life,
you can't afford attachments.

21:25.760 --> 21:28.650
You just gotta let go.

21:29.240 --> 21:32.608
Are we still talking about Sam,
or did you break up with someone too?

21:33.080 --> 21:34.605
- Me?
- Yeah.

21:35.280 --> 21:36.770
No.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.648
Your Majesty.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.405
You always been into LARPing?

21:45.600 --> 21:48.365
No. For role-play, I prefer a tabletop.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.650
D&D, Gamma World, Car Wars.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.610
That's why Cthulhu
invented multisided dice, right?

21:54.760 --> 21:56.524
But a buddy of mine
was into LARPing.

21:56.680 --> 21:59.286
Went for him, stayed for the chicks.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.849
It's not just that, though.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.331
It's an escape.

22:04.480 --> 22:07.723
I mean, here I'm queen, a hero.

22:07.880 --> 22:11.202
In the real world, I'm hacking out code
and chugging coffee all day.

22:11.360 --> 22:13.681
- Now, wait a second.
- Your Majesty.

22:13.840 --> 22:18.289
If it wasn't for you, we would've never
been able to take down Dick. Out there...

22:19.000 --> 22:20.206
...you are a hero.

22:24.320 --> 22:27.369
Noticing a lot of these maidens
checking you out.

22:27.520 --> 22:30.364
What? I can't shut this down.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.642
It's good to be queen.

22:43.520 --> 22:45.249
It's all just pad of the game.

22:46.080 --> 22:49.482
Genre mash-up. Cool.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.889
Hey, I know her. That's Phyllis.

22:52.480 --> 22:54.482
Heard she broke her ankles
or something.

22:56.920 --> 22:58.729
- Wow, looks like she got...
- Hobbled.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.445
Oh, and that's Jamie.

23:02.600 --> 23:05.604
He said someone broke into his house,
beat him with his mace...

23:05.760 --> 23:07.171
No signs of a forced entry.

23:08.720 --> 23:13.248
Do you recognize this from Moondoor?
I think it's Celtic.

23:13.400 --> 23:16.609
- No. Sorry. But I'll look it up.
- Thanks.

23:17.840 --> 23:20.889
I haven't seen anything like it
in my travels, Your Highness.

23:21.480 --> 23:24.529
All right.
Well, if you think of anything...

23:25.080 --> 23:26.411
...come see me in my tent.

23:27.960 --> 23:29.564
Anytime.

23:35.880 --> 23:38.770
Scratch the Elves off the list.

23:38.920 --> 23:41.571
Mace attacks. Hobbling.
Medieval poisoning.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.609
Somebody's targeting the queen's people.

23:43.760 --> 23:44.886
No. Not only them.

23:45.040 --> 23:47.441
See, those four are with the queen.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.090
But these two? They're Elves.

23:49.280 --> 23:52.523
And these two are Warriors.
Only group not to get hit...

23:52.720 --> 23:55.769
The Shadow Orcs. Last group on the list.
Impossible to find.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.922
Wait, I know one.
I met him on the way in.

23:58.120 --> 24:01.408
Perfect. Maybe he can tell us
what the frak this thing is.

24:01.560 --> 24:06.009
It's, uh, the Tree of Pain. Uh...

24:06.160 --> 24:10.643
If you are tagged with this mark,
you will be a victim of fairy magic.

24:10.840 --> 24:13.241
Wait. Fairy magic can be bad?

24:13.400 --> 24:15.004
Death to the queen!

24:15.160 --> 24:17.162
Death to the usurper!

24:17.320 --> 24:18.970
Death to her manservant!

24:21.160 --> 24:22.650
What?

24:22.800 --> 24:26.600
Well, there's no laptops in Moondoor.
There's no Geneva convention either.

24:26.760 --> 24:27.841
Hey.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.444
Have you seen this?

24:30.600 --> 24:31.840
Yeah, of course.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.411
No. No, I haven't seen it.

24:36.440 --> 24:40.525
It's the Shadow King's family crest.
You'll never find him in the Black Hills.

24:40.680 --> 24:41.886
The Black Hills?

24:42.080 --> 24:44.811
The forest behind the playground.
Come on.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.528
All right.
Thank you very much, Gholandria.

24:52.680 --> 24:54.364
Anytime.

24:54.520 --> 24:58.047
I've never done genre mash-up play
before. That was fun.

24:59.120 --> 25:01.361
First time for everything, right?

25:01.600 --> 25:05.286
First time for a lot of things
if you wanna come find my tent later.

25:05.480 --> 25:06.811
Uh...

25:08.080 --> 25:09.411
Another time.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.451
Your loss.

25:15.560 --> 25:18.643
My queen. There you are.
I've been searching everywhere for you.

25:18.800 --> 25:22.566
Has this oaf attempted to harm you
with his blasphemous metalworks?

25:22.720 --> 25:25.087
Boltar, he's with me. This is my new...

25:26.200 --> 25:28.407
...handmaiden.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.727
We seek an audience
with the Shadow King.

25:32.920 --> 25:36.925
Oh. These hills are not safe. I beseech
you, my queen, you should return to camp.

25:37.080 --> 25:40.004
He's right, Your Worshipfulness.

25:40.160 --> 25:42.970
Uh, may I have a moment
before you take your leavings?

25:43.120 --> 25:44.167
Mm.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.527
- Handmaiden?
- He was suspicious. I panicked.

25:48.680 --> 25:51.365
All right. Look, you take my phone,
find Sam.

25:51.520 --> 25:52.851
We'll find the Shadow Dorks.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.970
- But I can help.
- You are helping, by finding Sam. Go.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.729
Lead the way to the Orcs, Bolty.

26:02.880 --> 26:05.042
Speak when spoken to, handmaiden.

26:48.360 --> 26:49.691
- Unh!
- Dark magic.

26:49.840 --> 26:55.449
Aah! My eyes! The stinging of
your attack burns my very soul.

27:08.400 --> 27:09.925
Dark magic?

27:19.400 --> 27:22.643
Well, that was a bust. You sure the
Shadow Orcs are even out there?

27:22.800 --> 27:25.644
Hey, for a handmaiden,
you certainly ask many questions.

27:25.800 --> 27:29.327
Yes, I am positive. They're just
very good at hiding themselves.

27:29.480 --> 27:33.201
But a plan has sprung to mind
that will draw the Shadow King to us.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.364
We shall take the Shadow Orc,
offer him as a prisoner exchange.

27:36.520 --> 27:38.204
Draw them out and beat them down.

27:38.360 --> 27:40.840
- I like your style.
- I shall retrieve the prisoner.

27:41.000 --> 27:44.846
You tend to the queen's laundry and
chamber pots, then meet me back here.

27:47.240 --> 27:48.765
Nice outfit. Ahem.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.649
You love it.

27:51.240 --> 27:55.086
Right. Well, while you were playing
dress-up, I found out that the mark...

27:55.240 --> 27:57.481
Belongs to the Shadow Orcs.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.490
Yeah. And they're using fairy magic.

28:02.760 --> 28:04.842
"The Tree of Pain." Awesome.

28:05.000 --> 28:08.209
- Whoever gets marked gets ganked.
- All right. How do we stop it?

28:08.360 --> 28:11.807
Find whoever cast the spell.
Take them out. No more whammy, no marks.

28:12.000 --> 28:14.002
- No marks, no dead bodies.
- Okay. Perfect.

28:14.160 --> 28:17.562
Our pal Boltar the Chatty
is getting the Shadow Orc prisoner.

28:17.720 --> 28:20.963
Gonna do a prisoner exchange,
try to draw the king out of hiding.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.201
It was my idea.

28:24.600 --> 28:26.523
- Where's Charlie?
- She was with you.

28:26.720 --> 28:28.609
No, I sent her to you.

28:29.720 --> 28:31.324
Charlie.

28:31.520 --> 28:32.601
Your Highness?

28:34.320 --> 28:35.970
Charlie.

28:37.400 --> 28:40.802
You know what?
She's got my phone. Try it.

29:05.320 --> 29:06.845
Uh...

29:07.880 --> 29:09.405
Hi.

29:09.800 --> 29:13.725
I'm the, uh, Queen of Moons.

29:13.880 --> 29:15.723
Nice to meet you.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.602
Great costume, BT-dubs.

29:22.640 --> 29:26.087
Right. Well, this has been
a really great kidnapping...

29:26.280 --> 29:31.286
...but I gotta get back to not dying.
So good talk.

29:43.640 --> 29:49.409
Wow. Real magic. That is really
cool, if not mostly terrifying.

29:49.560 --> 29:50.766
Um...

29:50.920 --> 29:53.400
Right. Okay.

29:53.600 --> 29:57.730
We can work this out, can't we?
Get you some gold? My crown?

29:58.320 --> 30:00.209
Ritualistic sacrifice?

30:03.520 --> 30:06.683
Look, I am not really a queen.

30:07.480 --> 30:09.323
I'm just an IT girl.

30:09.800 --> 30:12.087
Standing in front of a monster.

30:12.240 --> 30:14.322
Asking it not to kill her.

30:17.120 --> 30:19.600
Great. The worst period of my life
comes to an end.

30:19.760 --> 30:24.084
I saw my boss get eaten by a Leviathan, broke
my arm, lived life on the run, got it all back.

30:24.640 --> 30:27.086
Now a dude in a stag-skull mask
is gonna kill me.

30:27.240 --> 30:28.969
I just want my old life back.

30:35.360 --> 30:36.885
That is all I want as well.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.205
If anything's happened to her...

30:51.360 --> 30:55.160
Dude, we checked all the tents.
We'll talk to these guys. We'll find her.

31:06.080 --> 31:08.242
Greetings, heretics.

31:09.400 --> 31:12.131
You should kneel before me, cur.

31:13.880 --> 31:15.689
- All right. Why don't you...?
- Silence!

31:16.160 --> 31:18.527
Now, before we exchange...

31:19.680 --> 31:20.806
...a few announcements.

31:23.880 --> 31:27.043
There is a peewee soccer playoff game
tomorrow on the alpha field.

31:27.200 --> 31:29.487
Don't wanna freak the mundanes.
We gotta move.

31:29.640 --> 31:31.927
That's it.
Gonna do this the old-fashioned way.

31:32.080 --> 31:33.605
- Dean. Don't. Come on.
- No.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.205
- I told you there...
- Shut up.

31:35.360 --> 31:38.921
All right. I need real answers.
This here is a real gun. See?

31:39.760 --> 31:43.321
- Whoa! Whoa! Hold! Hold! Jeez!
- Start talking.

31:43.480 --> 31:45.642
- Where's the queen?
- I don't know.

31:45.840 --> 31:49.640
Yeah, well, your little family crest there
tells a different story, pal.

31:49.840 --> 31:51.251
- This?
- Yeah.

31:51.400 --> 31:52.765
Uh...

31:52.920 --> 31:56.288
I got sick last month after this thing
just appeared on my arm.

31:57.600 --> 32:00.251
It looked cool,
so I turned it into my family crest.

32:00.400 --> 32:03.131
I mean, after my dermatologist
said it wasn't malignant.

32:03.280 --> 32:05.521
Dean, he's not our guy.
He's just another vic.

32:05.680 --> 32:09.127
My name is Max Hilby. I'm an attorney.
I have no idea where the queen is...

32:09.320 --> 32:12.449
...but if you let me go right now,
I won't press charges.

32:15.160 --> 32:16.924
I promise.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.526
Um...

32:21.680 --> 32:24.524
Here, take them. Please.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.651
Go. Go. Go.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.530
What? What?

32:35.320 --> 32:36.810
Is the queen really in danger?

32:38.760 --> 32:41.081
Okay, I noticed something odd
down by the creek.

32:41.240 --> 32:44.289
There's this weird tent.
It's not one of ours.

32:45.200 --> 32:46.281
It's kind of creepy.

32:46.480 --> 32:49.006
Why are you being so helpful
all of a sudden?

32:49.160 --> 32:51.162
Look, I harbor an epic crush
on the queen.

32:52.400 --> 32:55.563
Maybe you could put in a good word
for me when you find her?

32:56.360 --> 32:58.249
I don't think you're her type.

32:59.880 --> 33:03.646
What, you mean she's not into Orcs?

33:08.160 --> 33:12.802
My name is Gilda.
I'm from the Hollow Forest of Arkhmoor.

33:12.960 --> 33:14.086
I'm a fairy.

33:14.240 --> 33:16.163
Hmm. Swoon.

33:16.920 --> 33:20.561
Uh, I mean, how did you get here?

33:21.480 --> 33:23.562
I was summoned here by a spell.

33:24.040 --> 33:25.690
BY Whom?

33:25.840 --> 33:29.242
I don't know his name,
but I was brought here to do his bidding.

33:29.440 --> 33:32.091
His bidding? That's never good.

33:32.800 --> 33:36.771
My master, he...

33:37.400 --> 33:40.722
He has me hurt people.
He's forcing me to.

33:40.880 --> 33:43.645
I'd never hurt anyone.
I'm a fairy. The good kind.

33:43.800 --> 33:45.643
No, no, I get that.

33:45.800 --> 33:47.370
Why is he doing this?

33:48.280 --> 33:50.009
I don't know.

33:50.160 --> 33:54.768
He started off with smaller commands,
but he's become more violent.

33:55.920 --> 33:58.048
He had me kill two men this week.

33:59.240 --> 34:02.084
Man, someone is taking this game
way too seriously.

34:02.920 --> 34:04.524
Game?

34:05.560 --> 34:08.609
This, my outfit, all of this...

34:08.760 --> 34:10.524
...it's just a game here.

34:10.679 --> 34:13.047
Why would you play such a game?

34:13.239 --> 34:15.891
This world?
Mm, not so much with the awesome.

34:16.040 --> 34:20.443
The game is a way to get away.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.090
Hmm.

34:22.239 --> 34:24.368
It's a lovely forest.

34:24.520 --> 34:27.649
But it's nothing like my home.

34:28.840 --> 34:31.491
Right.
So how do we get you back there?

34:32.520 --> 34:35.409
I can't break free from the spell myself.

34:35.560 --> 34:38.962
A hero must take my master's book
of magic and destroy it...

34:39.120 --> 34:41.202
...breaking the spell.

34:42.400 --> 34:43.844
Gilda?

34:44.000 --> 34:45.650
My name is Charlie Bradbury.

34:46.159 --> 34:48.128
And I am here to rescue you.

34:57.040 --> 34:59.202
Why don't you take off?
We got it from here.

34:59.360 --> 35:03.729
A handmaiden and a time traveler
rescue the queen? I think not, kind lady.

35:03.880 --> 35:07.726
This isn't a game. The queen, our friend,
is in real danger. You could get hurt.

35:07.880 --> 35:09.609
I will not leave my queen in peril.

35:11.480 --> 35:13.164
Look, there.

35:13.960 --> 35:16.008
We haven't checked that tent.

35:36.720 --> 35:40.930
Dudes, if the tent is rocking,
don't come a-knocking.

35:41.080 --> 35:44.368
No, it's him. My master. Run!

35:55.560 --> 35:57.847
No guns in Moondoor, gentlemen.

35:58.680 --> 36:00.523
Gilda, if you please.

36:07.800 --> 36:08.926
Well, now what, Gerry?

36:10.600 --> 36:13.604
My name is Boltar the Furious!

36:14.480 --> 36:18.963
My plan was, after getting rid
of all my competition...

36:19.120 --> 36:20.849
...to win the battle tomorrow...

36:21.000 --> 36:23.526
...convincing the queen
that I should be her king.

36:24.320 --> 36:27.688
But then you two idiots showed up
and I was forced to improvise.

36:27.840 --> 36:30.525
Rescue the damsel in distress
from Orcs, become king...

36:30.680 --> 36:32.967
...kill you both. That'll work too.

36:33.120 --> 36:35.043
So why'd you go
from hobbling to murder?

36:36.000 --> 36:39.686
Greyfox and Thargrim became part of
the Honor Guard. Got close to the queen.

36:39.880 --> 36:41.644
They did it by breaking the rules...

36:41.840 --> 36:45.208
...paying off players with real money
rather than Moondoor currency.

36:45.360 --> 36:48.045
- They were cheating.
- Oh, and using magic isn't?

36:48.200 --> 36:50.009
Magic is a part of Moondoor.

36:50.160 --> 36:52.640
What is your problem?
Why would you hurt people?

36:52.800 --> 36:55.485
- This is just a game.
- There is no game!

36:55.640 --> 36:57.768
There is only Moondoor.

36:57.920 --> 36:59.649
I came here to be different.

37:00.520 --> 37:02.409
To get away from my crappy life.

37:02.560 --> 37:04.562
To be a hero. And guess what.

37:04.720 --> 37:09.089
What, you were a loser in the real world
and you're a loser here? Shocker.

37:09.280 --> 37:11.886
Would a loser track down
a real book of spells...

37:12.080 --> 37:14.208
...and compel a fairy to do his bidding?

37:14.360 --> 37:16.362
Depends. How did you get it?

37:18.520 --> 37:20.204
EBay.

37:22.920 --> 37:26.447
Look, it doesn't have to be like this,
Boltar.

37:27.000 --> 37:30.049
Just hand over the book of spells.
We can work this out.

37:30.200 --> 37:32.601
This will all work out...

37:32.760 --> 37:35.684
...after I remove you
from the playing field...

37:35.840 --> 37:37.569
...and wipe her memory.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.040
Gilda?

37:45.720 --> 37:46.881
Gilda, the big one.

38:01.200 --> 38:04.044
I can't stop him.
The book, you must destroy it.

38:11.920 --> 38:13.081
Hey, Gerry.

38:14.240 --> 38:16.846
I'm the one who saves damsels
in distress around here.

38:19.720 --> 38:21.404
No!

38:36.160 --> 38:37.764
Are you okay?

38:37.960 --> 38:40.008
I'm free of the spell.

38:40.160 --> 38:41.730
You saved me.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.366
The Hollow Forest is forever in your debt.

38:45.320 --> 38:47.527
I must return to those green hills now.

38:48.760 --> 38:51.161
I will take my former master with me.

38:51.320 --> 38:53.926
He must face a fairy tribunal for his sins.

38:54.080 --> 38:55.570
Wait.

39:08.040 --> 39:10.611
Call me, maybe?

39:15.400 --> 39:17.607
So, what's next for you, Charlie?

39:17.760 --> 39:20.240
New town? New identity?

39:20.400 --> 39:22.562
If the last 24 hours
has taught me anything...

39:22.720 --> 39:25.121
...it's that escaping
isn't what it used to be.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.089
No more replacement characters
for me.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.848
I gotta face reality from now on.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.128
Sadly,
reality actually includes monsters...

39:32.280 --> 39:34.487
...but what are you gonna do?

39:35.280 --> 39:37.806
If I can ever be of help to you guys,
let me know.

39:38.440 --> 39:42.161
Will do. And you, uh...? You're good?

39:43.160 --> 39:46.004
Apart from the fact you blocked me
from banging a fairy...

39:46.160 --> 39:48.003
...and I'm about to lose my crown...

39:48.160 --> 39:51.004
...thanks to my army being decimated? Heh.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.089
Yeah. Totally good.

39:55.720 --> 39:57.768
Smell you later, bitches.

40:05.720 --> 40:07.563
So, what's, uh...?

40:07.720 --> 40:11.247
What's next? Because no fun, right?

40:12.000 --> 40:16.130
Look, before you say anything, I get it.

40:16.280 --> 40:19.523
No amount of fun is gonna help you
get over what you gave up.

40:20.880 --> 40:22.723
You just, uh...

40:22.880 --> 40:25.565
You need time. Right?

40:26.200 --> 40:27.725
Yeah.

40:28.320 --> 40:29.924
Thanks.

40:30.080 --> 40:31.764
And you're right. Ahem.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.604
Having fun won't help me.

40:35.840 --> 40:36.966
It'll help both of us.

40:38.760 --> 40:40.489
Shall we?

40:46.720 --> 40:51.123
And dying in your beds
many years from now...

40:51.640 --> 40:53.722
...would you be willing to trade...

40:53.880 --> 40:57.248
...all the days, from this day to that...

40:57.760 --> 40:59.046
...for one chance...

40:59.240 --> 41:01.402
- Isn't that the speech from...?
- Only one he knows.

41:01.600 --> 41:03.568
...Just one chance...

41:04.160 --> 41:06.322
...to come back here...

41:06.520 --> 41:08.443
...and tell our enemies...

41:08.600 --> 41:11.126
...that they may take our lives...

41:11.320 --> 41:13.288
- ...but they will never take...
- Hold!

41:18.680 --> 41:19.966
- Uh, my bad.
- Really?

41:20.160 --> 41:22.561
- Sorry.
- You can't be serious.

41:27.200 --> 41:28.531
...Our freedom!

41:36.200 --> 41:39.761
This episode is dedicated
to the men, women, elves...

41:39.920 --> 41:43.811
...demigods, magi, druids
and chamber-pot servants...

41:43.960 --> 41:46.281
...who gave their lives
fighting and winning...

41:46.480 --> 41:49.370
...for the Queen of Moons
in the Battle of Kingdoms.

41:49.520 --> 41:53.206
Go bravely into the next world,
fallen soldiers.
