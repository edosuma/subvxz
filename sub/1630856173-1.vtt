01:54.416 --> 01:56.500
You sure got a thing for candy canes,
don't you, Chris?

01:56.500 --> 01:57.875
Yeah.

01:57.875 --> 02:00.875
And you sure got a thing
for big blow-up dolls, don't you, Bruce?

02:00.875 --> 02:02.916
Yeah, I love those blow-up dolls.

02:02.916 --> 02:05.666
Oh. Okay. No.

02:05.666 --> 02:07.083
I see what you did there.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.958
Did you blow all those up?

02:08.958 --> 02:11.625
We're, uh, we're a family that blows.

02:11.625 --> 02:15.291
And I see you're, uh, still carving
your wood-- little hobby.

02:15.291 --> 02:17.375
Yeah. All hand-carved.

02:17.375 --> 02:18.750
Yeah, it's cute.

02:18.750 --> 02:21.000
It's not first-place cute, but it's cute.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.750
I don't know how a blow-up doll
could, you know,

02:22.750 --> 02:25.333
compare with this handcraftsmanship.

02:25.333 --> 02:27.500
Not interested.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.708
- Well, we'll see. We'll see, Bruce.
- We w-- We will see.

02:29.708 --> 02:31.750
We will see. We will see.

02:31.750 --> 02:32.958
We will see.

02:32.958 --> 02:38.333
Do I want an invisibility cloak
or flying shoes?

02:38.333 --> 02:40.625
If an elf can make it,
you can wish for it, okay?

02:40.625 --> 02:42.541
Santa's elves can make anything.

02:42.541 --> 02:44.541
They can make anything.
Now finish that letter.

02:44.541 --> 02:46.666
Come on. We got to send it
all the way to the North Pole.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.041
How much more inflatable crap
is Bruce gonna put on that roof?

02:49.041 --> 02:52.166
Oh, Bruce.
Babe, thank you for reminding me.

02:52.166 --> 02:54.500
Please don't forget to buy a nice bottle
of red for us to go over there tonight.

02:54.500 --> 02:57.375
I'm not getting a good bottle
for the competition.

02:57.375 --> 02:59.416
They're not the competition.
They're our neighbors.

02:59.416 --> 03:01.875
Dad, where are my cleats?

03:01.875 --> 03:03.041
Your cleats are right here.

03:03.041 --> 03:05.041
You know, Joy, I was wondering:
Since you're having such a hard time

03:05.041 --> 03:06.583
keeping track of things
while you're at home,

03:06.583 --> 03:09.791
what's gonna happen
when you go off to college...

03:11.250 --> 03:12.750
Notre Dame?

03:12.750 --> 03:14.500
How'd this get in the house?

03:16.083 --> 03:21.291
Dad, I... I know that you guys met at USC,
but I don't want to go there.

03:21.291 --> 03:23.875
What?! Huh?!

03:25.833 --> 03:27.458
Excuse me.

03:27.458 --> 03:29.125
USC is in your blood.

03:29.125 --> 03:32.250
- Fight on.
- Fight on!

03:32.250 --> 03:36.458
Listen, sweetheart, I-I would be happy
to call my old softball coach.

03:36.458 --> 03:37.708
- No, Mom, I...

03:37.708 --> 03:41.000
I'm-I'm shattered
that you don't want to go to USC.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.958
Wow. Joy.

03:42.958 --> 03:45.166
USC. Fight on.

03:45.166 --> 03:47.250
- Fight on, honey.
- Fight on.

03:48.458 --> 03:50.333
Only a half hour away.

03:50.333 --> 03:52.291
You could spend so much time with Dad.

03:52.291 --> 03:53.583
- That's right.

03:53.583 --> 03:55.041
It's only 20 minutes with no traffic.

03:55.041 --> 03:56.291
You could eat dinner with your family
every night.

03:56.291 --> 03:58.333
Yeah.

03:58.333 --> 04:01.208
Nick, um, how did that math test go?

04:01.208 --> 04:03.416
Oh, you had a math test? What'd you get?

04:03.416 --> 04:05.666
I don't let grades define me, Dad.

04:05.666 --> 04:08.125
All right, that does not sound good.

04:08.125 --> 04:09.708
Yeah, that don't sound good at all.

04:09.708 --> 04:13.166
Look, Nick, if you want to win in life,
you have to learn to focus

04:13.166 --> 04:15.041
- on what's important.

04:15.041 --> 04:17.083
Well, my music is important.

04:17.083 --> 04:19.041
Math is required. Music is elective.

04:19.041 --> 04:21.333
Okay, but, sweetie,
the-the music makes him happy.

04:21.333 --> 04:23.416
Yeah, but he ain't gonna make no money
making music.

04:23.416 --> 04:26.708
Well, I mean, there's a lot of
music people that make money, Chris.

04:26.708 --> 04:27.791
Not playing the tuba.

04:27.791 --> 04:31.041
Name one tuba player
that's living his life like it's golden.

04:31.041 --> 04:32.750
- Oh.
- Just one.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.708
Have you ever heard
somebody in the band say,

04:34.708 --> 04:37.250
"And on tuba is," and they introduce him?

04:37.250 --> 04:39.250
Hey, hon, I think
you should focus on the math.

04:39.250 --> 04:40.666
You should focus on the math.

04:40.666 --> 04:42.458
No one ever blew up on the tuba.

Lee, nobody can talk
to the vendors like I can.

05:39.208 --> 05:42.666
Nobody has my relationships,
my history and my Rolodex.

05:42.666 --> 05:44.750
Rolodex, huh?

05:44.750 --> 05:46.166

05:46.166 --> 05:47.500
I love it.

05:52.041 --> 05:53.625
It's just business.

05:54.916 --> 05:57.291
Listen, we know it's the holidays.

05:57.291 --> 05:58.833
- We want to give you something

05:58.833 --> 06:00.916

06:03.625 --> 06:05.458
Hey, don't nobody want your fleece.

Hey, you know what?
I'm-a take this fleece.

contempt I have for your holiday fleece.

06:16.875 --> 06:19.166

06:19.166 --> 06:20.291
Yeah.

06:21.416 --> 06:23.833
Merry Christmas, brother.

06:25.791 --> 06:27.375
Merry Christmas.

06:28.750 --> 06:30.833
Uh, who's next?

06:30.833 --> 06:35.541
So I stopped the bleeding
on the night sort by 14%.

06:35.541 --> 06:37.625
Great job as always, Carol. Right?

06:37.625 --> 06:39.750
The regionals are gonna be
impressed by all this.

06:39.750 --> 06:43.083
So, do you think
that they will consider me

06:43.083 --> 06:45.458
for the director of operations position?

06:45.458 --> 06:48.750
I feel like when the regionals come,
they'll see how we are the...

06:48.750 --> 06:51.791
that we're the best distribution center
in the west.

06:52.958 --> 06:55.125
Because of me and-and because of you.
Because of you.

06:55.125 --> 06:59.166
And be-- well, because of--
mostly because of me, so...

06:59.166 --> 07:01.750
can I count on your support?

07:01.750 --> 07:03.375
If everything goes perfectly.

07:03.375 --> 07:05.250
- Yes! Thank you.
- You got it.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.458
- Good work.
- Thank you so much.

07:07.458 --> 07:09.583
Thanks. Yes!

07:12.000 --> 07:13.416
Hello, Mrs. Carver.

07:13.416 --> 07:16.166
You are never gonna believe
what just happened.

07:16.166 --> 07:18.083
Yeah, you know, I was gonna say
the same thing to you.

07:18.083 --> 07:20.750
I did it. I-I got, I got Donald's support.

07:20.750 --> 07:23.041
Oh, that's great, babe.

07:23.041 --> 07:24.875
They'd be crazy not to promote you.

07:24.875 --> 07:28.500
Chris, this is gonna be, like, an increase
in pay and-and more vacation time.

07:28.500 --> 07:31.166
Hey, listen, um...

07:31.166 --> 07:33.916
- something funny happened here today, too.
- Oh, hang on. Hang on a--

07:33.916 --> 07:35.458
- There's a backup in the sort.

07:35.458 --> 07:36.666
- I'm gonna call you back.
- Hey, Carol, listen...

07:36.666 --> 07:39.541
I'll call you later. Okay, bye.

- You're my what, now?
- Outplacement officer.

07:48.583 --> 07:51.125
- An outplacement officer?
- Yes, you're being outplaced.

07:51.125 --> 07:52.375
Ah, yes, I-I know.

07:52.375 --> 07:53.625
I knew I was being outplaced,

07:53.625 --> 07:58.916
but I didn't know that there was
an actual, uh, officer that assisted you.

07:58.916 --> 08:01.583
Yes, I'm here to help.
How are you feeling today?

08:01.583 --> 08:06.208
Well, you know, I got that...
got that, uh, outplaced feeling.

08:06.208 --> 08:08.041
So is this what you do?

08:08.041 --> 08:09.875
You help the fired people
leave their jobs?

08:09.875 --> 08:11.416
- RFPs.
- Oh, R--

08:11.416 --> 08:14.416
-"Recently fired persons."
- Oh, wow. Thank you, Kimmer.

08:14.416 --> 08:17.125
- And out we go.

09:06.083 --> 09:08.291

09:08.291 --> 09:10.666
There's something I... I...

09:10.666 --> 09:12.291
Where's the red wine?

09:12.291 --> 09:14.291
Ah, damn it.

09:14.291 --> 09:15.583
Oh, Chris, come on.

09:15.583 --> 09:17.875
I really don't want
to drink that box wine.

09:17.875 --> 09:19.083
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, honey.

09:19.083 --> 09:22.000
- You look pretty, Mom.
- Aw, thank you, sweetie.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.833
Hey, can you tell Joy and Nick
that we're across the street? -Yeah.

09:24.833 --> 09:26.666
- And the pizza's on its way, okay?
- Okay.

09:26.666 --> 09:29.125
- You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

09:30.583 --> 09:32.625
Okay, I think we should try pickleball.

09:32.625 --> 09:35.500
Seriously, everybody's doing it.
Scott and Shelly are doing it.

09:35.500 --> 09:40.250
And I think that we should get
those matching headbands and, um, shorts.

09:40.250 --> 09:41.875
You look so good in those shorts.

09:41.875 --> 09:43.625
And that way, we could do stuff together.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.916
It'll be like we used to do.
You know how we used to do that?

09:45.916 --> 09:48.416
We would dress up and we would go out
and do, like, an activity.

09:48.416 --> 09:50.625
- Hey, Carol. Hey.
- Yes, my darling?

09:50.625 --> 09:51.833
Yes?

09:53.583 --> 09:55.375
I got laid off.

09:55.375 --> 09:57.458
Wait, what?

09:57.458 --> 09:59.750
I got laid off.

09:59.750 --> 10:02.416
Lee sold the company,
and they cut the sales division in half,

10:02.416 --> 10:03.750
and I was in the wrong half.

10:03.750 --> 10:06.375
Oh, my God. Wait, when did this happen?

10:06.375 --> 10:07.625
This morning.

10:07.625 --> 10:10.333
I didn't want to say anything about it
'cause you were so excited

10:10.333 --> 10:13.375
talking about Donald and the promotion.

10:13.375 --> 10:16.208
I just didn't want to ruin it, so...

10:16.208 --> 10:18.583
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

10:18.583 --> 10:19.750
I'm screwed.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.666
No, you're not screwed.
You're not screwed.

10:21.666 --> 10:23.958
We'll... we'll figure this out.

10:23.958 --> 10:26.750
We will. -Listen, the kids
can't find out about this, okay?

10:26.750 --> 10:28.000
What are you talking about? They love you.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.250
They do, and they should know
what's going on.

10:30.250 --> 10:32.708
No, I just don't want to ruin
the last Christmas.

10:34.333 --> 10:35.958
"Last Christmas"?
What are you talking about?

10:35.958 --> 10:37.958
- Joy is moving out.
- Uh-huh.

10:37.958 --> 10:40.500
Nick is not that far behind, and...

10:40.500 --> 10:43.125
Oh, my God, my little baby girl is almost
old enough to realize what's going on.

10:43.125 --> 10:45.125
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:46.291 --> 10:50.041
You got thrown a curveball, all right,
but this is not our last Christmas.

10:50.041 --> 10:51.208
Okay?

10:51.208 --> 10:53.625
It's okay. We're gonna figure it out.

10:53.625 --> 10:55.916
- Are we?
- Yes, we are. We're gonna figure it out.

10:57.541 --> 10:59.791
- All right.
Ahoy, neighbors!

10:59.791 --> 11:01.750
Permission to come aboard!

11:01.750 --> 11:02.958
I got the good stuff!

11:02.958 --> 11:05.291
Yeah, join us for a box of grog!

11:05.291 --> 11:07.083
He means wine!

11:07.083 --> 11:08.958
We'll be right over!

11:08.958 --> 11:10.666
Give us two secs!

11:10.666 --> 11:12.041
There's a box of wine, though.

11:12.041 --> 11:13.750
Yeah.

11:13.750 --> 11:15.958
Do you want to skip this?

11:15.958 --> 11:17.458
- We can skip it.
- No, you heard him.

11:17.458 --> 11:20.041
- He got the good stuff. Let's go.
- All right.

11:20.041 --> 11:22.625
Could do with a glass of the good stuff.

11:22.625 --> 11:24.541
- I'll drink the box myself.

11:24.541 --> 11:25.708
Maybe I'll feel better.

11:25.708 --> 11:27.333
I'll give you some good stuff later.

11:27.333 --> 11:30.333
Oh, okay, I'm-a hold you to that.
-  Okay.

11:35.166 --> 11:37.333
Aidan's school called.

11:37.333 --> 11:39.541
Apparently, compared to
the other kids in his class,

11:39.541 --> 11:43.208
he is testing off the charts in math.

11:43.208 --> 11:45.333
You know, I saw an article online recently

11:45.333 --> 11:48.916
that said a lot of sociopaths
were math prodigies.

11:50.208 --> 11:51.666
But not Aidan.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.875
Well, I don't know about you guys, but
I'm so excited Candy Cane Lane is here.

11:56.875 --> 11:59.250
- Yeah.
- The lights, the decorations,

11:59.250 --> 12:00.541
the goodwill between neighbors.

12:00.541 --> 12:03.083
I hear the competition
is different this year.

12:03.083 --> 12:05.333
Hurry up, guys. It's about to start.

12:05.333 --> 12:07.166
This is Prism 1.

12:07.166 --> 12:09.500
Seeing the world through your eyes.

12:11.041 --> 12:13.541
Hi. I'm Emerson Turner.

12:13.541 --> 12:15.291
And I'm (clicks tongue) Kit Kleiman.

12:15.291 --> 12:17.250
Oh, that's-that's new.

12:17.250 --> 12:20.500
And we're hosting
the Candy Cane Lane Spectacular

12:20.500 --> 12:22.666
live from beautiful El Segundo.

12:22.666 --> 12:24.750
Only on Prism Cable.

12:24.750 --> 12:27.791
Not only will there be
music, merrymaking...

12:27.791 --> 12:29.000
And lights!

12:29.000 --> 12:31.208
...but there will be high stakes as well,

12:31.208 --> 12:33.750
as the neighbors compete
for best decorated house,

12:33.750 --> 12:35.333
and because of our sponsors...

12:35.333 --> 12:37.708
Wait, sponsor?
We've never had a sponsor. What?

12:37.708 --> 12:40.583
- ...$100,000.

12:40.583 --> 12:42.166
I'm sorry, what?

12:42.166 --> 12:44.416
- Shut up! -Oh, my...

12:44.416 --> 12:46.125
$100,000?

12:46.125 --> 12:48.500
Join us all week
as we cover the festivities,

12:48.500 --> 12:52.166
starting with
our Santa's house lighting parade.

12:52.166 --> 12:55.916
And ending with our spectacular finale
on Christmas Eve.

12:55.916 --> 12:57.500
- Christmas Eve!

12:57.500 --> 12:59.541
Christmas Eve is only three days away,

12:59.541 --> 13:02.416
so let the competition begin.

13:02.416 --> 13:04.291
- Ho ho ho.

13:08.458 --> 13:10.041
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Yeah.

13:10.041 --> 13:12.500
- This was so fun.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.708
- I'm tired.
- Thank you so much.

13:13.708 --> 13:15.625
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:15.625 --> 13:17.291
It was so nice. It was so nice.

13:17.291 --> 13:19.041
It was so ni-- thank-- okay, we're--

13:19.041 --> 13:20.166
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, have a good night.

13:20.166 --> 13:21.416
- We got to get Aidan...
- The wine was amazing.

13:21.416 --> 13:24.375
Of course, we got to get Aidan to sleep.
Good night, everybody!

13:36.083 --> 13:37.416
I need your brackets to mount a reindeer.

13:37.416 --> 13:38.875
What?

13:42.750 --> 13:44.250
Dad!

13:48.208 --> 13:49.583
Dad, are you, are you serious?

13:49.583 --> 13:51.500
Thank you, son.

13:57.458 --> 13:58.625
I've got a supplier.

13:58.625 --> 14:00.625
I can hook you up with more
if you need it.

14:00.625 --> 14:02.250
That's my girl.

14:02.250 --> 14:04.583
Uh, what is all this?

14:04.583 --> 14:06.208
- What is this?
- What do you mean, what is all that?

14:06.208 --> 14:07.958
You said to get a plan, so I got a plan.

14:07.958 --> 14:09.291
Ugh. Okay.

14:09.291 --> 14:12.583
Hey, look, I know it looks like a lot,
but I got to do something spectacular,

14:12.583 --> 14:13.750
something they've never seen before.

14:13.750 --> 14:16.250
- Okay, well...
- This'll be...

14:16.250 --> 14:19.000
I was talking about
a plan for after Christmas.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.916
- Mm.
- Yes, like

14:20.916 --> 14:23.208
maybe update your LinkedIn,

14:23.208 --> 14:26.708
telling your vendors, letting people know
you're back on the market.

14:26.708 --> 14:28.333
You know, we good, we good.

14:28.333 --> 14:29.625
- You know why?
- Why?

14:29.625 --> 14:31.541
'Cause I'm gonna win Candy Cane Lane.

14:31.541 --> 14:34.333
Oh, my love, I know that this is something
that's so important to you,

14:34.333 --> 14:39.541
but I think that you need to consider
the idea that you might not win.

14:39.541 --> 14:43.333
Oh, well, I also might not not win.

14:43.333 --> 14:46.375
Okay, you know what?
Let's go, guys. Come on. Let's go.

14:46.375 --> 14:48.291
- Let's go to school. Oh.
- Yes. Get the show on the road.

14:48.291 --> 14:50.250
Hey, can you bring Holly to school today?

14:50.250 --> 14:52.666
I don't know if I can do that
because I got a lot of stuff to do today.

14:52.666 --> 14:55.416
I'm really busy.
I got to get a thousand icicles.

14:55.416 --> 14:58.375
- God, okay, well, I got to go to work.
- Okay, touché.

14:58.375 --> 14:59.458
- Touché.
- Okay, you're going to work.

14:59.458 --> 15:01.541
- Uh-huh. You got it?
- Okay. I will handle it.

15:01.541 --> 15:02.791
- Thank you.
- Thank you, my love.

15:02.791 --> 15:04.250
- All right, I love you.
- Love you, too.

15:04.250 --> 15:05.958
- Bye-bye!

15:05.958 --> 15:09.083
Yeah, I'm not going to school, am I?

15:09.083 --> 15:11.416
Don't be ridiculous. Of course you're not.

15:28.875 --> 15:30.291
Already?

15:31.666 --> 15:33.541
You got to be freaking kidding me.

15:40.083 --> 15:42.708
But our decorations are handmade.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.166
They'll see how hard you worked.

15:44.166 --> 15:45.791
That's better than buying stuff.

15:45.791 --> 15:48.875
Hard work? Nobody cares anymore.

15:49.875 --> 15:51.791
And crap beats quality every time.

15:52.875 --> 15:54.541
Hard work.

15:54.541 --> 15:56.666
I'm sorry, you're old enough
to know the truth.

15:56.666 --> 15:59.875
Whenever somebody says to you,
"It's just business,"

15:59.875 --> 16:01.666
then you're the one getting f--

16:01.666 --> 16:03.833
Fleeced. Fleeced.

16:03.833 --> 16:05.708
"Fleeced"?

16:05.708 --> 16:06.916
Fleeced, yes.

16:06.916 --> 16:09.000
Yeah, fleeced.
You're the one getting fleeced.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.916
I got fleeced yesterday.

16:12.083 --> 16:13.916
And I did not like it.

16:17.875 --> 16:20.208
Who cares about craftsmanship
or relationships?

16:20.208 --> 16:22.250
You spent your whole career developing.

16:22.250 --> 16:25.583
- Toss you out like cheap plastic...
- Dad. Stop!

16:53.583 --> 16:56.125
Holly, look at this.

16:56.125 --> 16:57.708
Wow.

17:42.958 --> 17:45.916
This is unbelievable.

17:45.916 --> 17:48.250
- Wow.
- This is amazing.

17:48.250 --> 17:49.750
Look at this detail here.

17:49.750 --> 17:51.125
- I know.
- Look at this thing. It looks like...

17:51.125 --> 17:52.625
- Merry Christmas!
- Oh, sh-- Hey.

17:52.625 --> 17:54.166
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

17:54.166 --> 17:56.250
I didn't mean to scare you.

17:57.708 --> 17:59.583
Who am I kidding? Of course I did.

17:59.583 --> 18:01.500
What's Christmas without a little terror?

18:01.500 --> 18:03.166
I'm Pepper.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.125
Hey, Pepper.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.083
Uh, hey, h-how long
has this place been here?

18:07.083 --> 18:10.125
Oh, well, we're what the kids call
a pop-up.

18:10.125 --> 18:12.500
You know, here today, gone tomorrow. Pop.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.916
Very Instagrammable. Go on, take an elfie.

18:14.916 --> 18:16.375
Oh.

18:16.375 --> 18:17.833
Sorry, sugarplum.

18:17.833 --> 18:19.916
Please, please be careful with that.

18:19.916 --> 18:22.083
That's very precious to me.

18:22.083 --> 18:24.458
They look so real.

18:24.458 --> 18:25.666
Don't they?

18:25.666 --> 18:27.541
Each one has their own story.

18:27.541 --> 18:28.833
So what's yours?

18:28.833 --> 18:30.625
Indoor, outdoor? Flashy, classy?

18:30.625 --> 18:31.791
Mistletoe, mistle-no?

18:31.791 --> 18:34.208
- We are looking to kick some ass.
- Ah-ah.

18:34.208 --> 18:36.416
That's not what she meant to say, Holly.

18:36.416 --> 18:37.833
Oh, children always say what they mean.

18:37.833 --> 18:39.875
It's adults you can't trust.

18:39.875 --> 18:41.750
See, I like her.

18:41.750 --> 18:42.958
Yeah.
- Mm.

18:42.958 --> 18:44.625
Listen.

18:44.625 --> 18:47.916
Every year, our block
goes all out for Christmas.

18:47.916 --> 18:49.291
You have my attention.

18:49.291 --> 18:50.791
And this year,
the stakes are higher than ever.

18:50.791 --> 18:52.083
Keeping up with the Joneses.

18:52.083 --> 18:54.166
It's actually gonna be televised
this year.

18:54.166 --> 18:55.791
Cable? Streaming? The Internet?

18:55.791 --> 18:57.541
Probably all of that.

18:57.541 --> 18:59.791
This year, the competition's got
a lot of money on the line,

18:59.791 --> 19:01.208
and I mean a lot of money.

19:01.208 --> 19:03.833
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold your reindeers.

19:03.833 --> 19:05.291
Christmas is not about money.

19:05.291 --> 19:06.708
I agree. Christmas is...

19:06.708 --> 19:08.250
It has never been about money.

19:08.250 --> 19:09.916
Christmas is not about money.

19:09.916 --> 19:12.166
- It's not.
- Except that it is.

19:12.166 --> 19:15.291
I'm just kidding. Of course it is.

19:15.291 --> 19:16.708
'Tis the reason for the season.

19:16.708 --> 19:18.791

20:17.583 --> 20:19.750
Are you kidding me? I'm Mr. Christmas.

20:19.750 --> 20:21.291
Christmas is about giving.

20:21.291 --> 20:24.000
And Christmas is about
the power of a child's imagination.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.416
And it's about giving the least popular
reindeer with the red nose

20:27.416 --> 20:29.458
- a chance to be great.
- Mm.

20:29.458 --> 20:32.500
Unless you want to go the religious angle.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.583
Jesus Christ, no.

20:34.583 --> 20:35.791

Yeah.

21:26.958 --> 21:28.500

22:52.000 --> 22:53.833
Let me win this thing.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.791
It's stupid. Daddy's trippin'.

23:46.416 --> 23:48.916
<i>This is Prism 1.</i>

23:51.083 --> 23:55.000
It's beginning to look a lot like
Christmas here in El Segundo.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.208
I'm (clicks tongue) Kit Kleiman.

23:57.208 --> 23:59.125
We're still doing that.

23:59.125 --> 24:03.583
And I'm Emerson Turner, and welcome
to opening night here on Candy Cane Lane

24:03.583 --> 24:05.625
- where the temperature is cooling off...
- Ooh.

24:05.625 --> 24:07.250
...but the competition, my friends,

24:07.250 --> 24:08.916
- the competition is heating up.

24:08.916 --> 24:12.666
And let me just say how thrilled I am
to be here with you.

24:12.666 --> 24:15.208
And I am also here with you.

24:15.208 --> 24:19.916
Well, the 1300 block of Acacia Avenue
is about to get lit.

24:23.750 --> 24:26.291
And with good reason, 'cause this year,

24:26.291 --> 24:30.125
the residents of Candy Cane Lane
are competing for a $100,000 prize.

24:30.125 --> 24:31.666
Well, this is exciting.

24:31.666 --> 24:33.833
I've been looking forward to this
all year.

24:33.833 --> 24:36.166
And you know what,
I've been looking forward to this, boy,

24:36.166 --> 24:38.041
ever since I graduated top of my class

24:38.041 --> 24:39.833
from the Columbia Graduate School
of Journalism.

24:39.833 --> 24:40.916
Really?

24:40.916 --> 24:43.166
No. So let's kick it off by sending it

24:43.166 --> 24:47.000
to our Prism Cable News meteorologist
Sunny Roberts.

24:49.250 --> 24:51.333

<i>Can I give y'all some advice?</i>

24:51.333 --> 24:54.000
When y'all brought the spaceship out
and mixed it in with Santa Claus,

24:54.000 --> 24:56.083
it screamed, "I don't want to win."

24:56.083 --> 24:57.875
I'm sorry, who is that?

24:57.875 --> 25:00.625
Oh, that's my nephew Josh!

25:00.625 --> 25:02.333
He's an influencer.

25:02.333 --> 25:04.833
Okay, where is... where's Sunny?

Well, you heard him.

- What?

31:18.958 --> 31:21.083
Hey, what are you listening to?

31:21.083 --> 31:22.500
Uh, it's-- I wrote it.

31:22.500 --> 31:23.833

31:23.833 --> 31:25.625
Uh, no.

No.

31:52.166 --> 31:54.458
- No, no, no! This is...
Chris!

31:54.458 --> 31:56.208
- No!
- Chris!

31:56.208 --> 31:58.583
Hey, Carol, we've been vandalized.
Somebody trashed the whole...

31:59.708 --> 32:02.250
I know we are not doing live swans.

32:02.250 --> 32:04.625
No.

32:04.625 --> 32:06.625
What the hell's all of this?

32:06.625 --> 32:07.750
I don't know.

32:07.750 --> 32:11.083
But you mean to tell me
that you will not let the kids get a dog,

32:11.083 --> 32:13.041
but you're gonna get swans?

32:13.041 --> 32:14.125
These guys need to go.

32:14.125 --> 32:16.416
I didn't do this.
I didn't bring these back here.

32:18.250 --> 32:21.416
But now that you mention it, live animals
would make a hell of a statement.

32:21.416 --> 32:22.625
No, no.

32:22.625 --> 32:25.291
I am squashing the swans, okay?

32:25.291 --> 32:26.958
And I do not want to be late
for regionals.

32:26.958 --> 32:28.833
Get these out of here. -O-Okay,
I'll get rid, I'll get rid of 'em.

32:28.833 --> 32:30.583
- It's in the pool. That's disgusting.
- Okay, I'm gonna--

32:30.583 --> 32:32.458
- I'll get rid of 'em.
- Please, please.

Hey, hey, little swan.

32:35.333 --> 32:36.500
Hi.

32:36.500 --> 32:38.583
All right, listen, you swans,
y'all have to get up out of here.

32:38.583 --> 32:39.875
Let's go. Let's go.

32:39.875 --> 32:41.250
Come on.

32:41.250 --> 32:44.000
- Oh! Hey! Hey!

32:52.625 --> 32:54.916
Don't worry about this, honey.
I can fix this.

32:54.916 --> 32:57.958
- Hey, Bruce. Hey, Tricky Bruce.
What?

32:57.958 --> 32:59.625
Yeah, I know you know
what happened to my ornaments.

32:59.625 --> 33:00.708
Don't act like you don't know.

33:00.708 --> 33:01.791
Hundred percent don't know
what you're talking about.

33:01.791 --> 33:02.875
Don't act like you don't know
what happened.

33:02.875 --> 33:04.125
You know exactly what happened
to them ornaments.

33:04.125 --> 33:05.458
I have no idea
what you're talking about, Chris.

33:05.458 --> 33:06.708
And you know what just dawned on me?

33:06.708 --> 33:10.000
That whoever did it wasn't working alone,
Scott and Shelly.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
- Why would we do it?
- Look, the only thing I know is

33:12.000 --> 33:14.083
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You know exactly what I'm talking about.

33:14.083 --> 33:16.000
And if you don't know
what I'm talking about,

33:16.000 --> 33:18.208
maybe you should ask Scott and Shelly
what I'm talking about,

33:18.208 --> 33:20.083
'cause I think they might know.

33:20.083 --> 33:22.208
- Chris, we didn't do anything.

33:22.208 --> 33:24.250
We didn't do anything.
Did you guys do anything?

33:24.250 --> 33:25.416
- No.
- I did nothing.

33:25.416 --> 33:28.000
- Okay.
Stop looking at me like that, man.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.666
Oh, my God.
- Creeping me out, man.

33:30.666 --> 33:35.000
Yeah, you see, it's all good holiday cheer
till there's $100,000 on the line.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.291
Then you see what happens
to the thin veneer of neighborly love?

33:37.291 --> 33:38.375
What are you gonna do, Dad?

33:38.375 --> 33:39.583
I'm gonna go back to that weird woman

33:39.583 --> 33:41.333
and see if she can hook me up
with some replacement parts.

33:41.333 --> 33:43.291
- Can I come?
- Don't you have school?

33:43.291 --> 33:45.250
It's the last day.

33:45.250 --> 33:49.041
We're watching <i>Frozen</i>
in like three different classes.

33:49.041 --> 33:51.458
You know, you're very, very cute,
and you're also very manipulative.

33:54.083 --> 33:56.250
Hey, I don't know about this bird.

33:56.250 --> 33:58.083
Well, Pepper did say it was good luck.

33:58.083 --> 34:00.166
Not so far.

34:14.875 --> 34:15.916
What was that?

34:15.916 --> 34:18.000
- Oh, my God.

34:35.958 --> 34:37.291
Oh.

34:50.291 --> 34:52.250

35:12.750 --> 35:15.583

35:20.708 --> 35:24.291

the instructions said to rub it.

35:24.291 --> 35:27.041
- Weird instructions, by the way.
- What was your wish? Fame?

35:27.041 --> 35:29.291
No, fortune.

ornaments, and I need some replacements.

Hey, Holly, don't get so close

37:48.500 --> 37:50.750
I light the lamp. I blow it out.

37:58.875 --> 38:00.750
Pepper was Santa's favorite,

on the naughty list.

38:10.166 --> 38:11.500
- Ew.

38:11.500 --> 38:12.750
And then she just quit.

38:12.750 --> 38:14.458

Ex-- Y-Yes!

43:54.458 --> 43:55.791

43:55.791 --> 43:59.166

44:00.833 --> 44:02.083
Unpredictability.

44:02.083 --> 44:04.166
- Chickens.
- Chickens.

44:04.166 --> 44:07.416
You would avoid all of that

46:28.333 --> 46:30.375

46:30.375 --> 46:33.083
Only you have to complete
some crazy, stupid, impossible challenge.

46:33.083 --> 46:35.541
- Well, why me?
- Why any of us?

46:35.541 --> 46:36.958
Because we took the bait.

46:36.958 --> 46:38.791
Anyone can make one mistake,

46:38.791 --> 46:41.500
and then you're cursed
and no one can help you.

46:41.500 --> 46:46.208
She's evil but needy like a cat you bought
and raised but hates your guts.

46:46.208 --> 46:48.833
Well, she sent me looking for gold,
frankincense and myrrh.

46:48.833 --> 46:50.333
I mean, gold was easy, obviously.

46:50.333 --> 46:51.875

46:51.875 --> 46:53.666
But what even is that other stuff?

46:53.666 --> 46:56.041
I went to every Sephora I could find.

46:56.041 --> 46:58.708
I found plenty of Fenty but no myrrh.
No myrrh!

46:58.708 --> 47:01.166
And she made me dress up
as a New York City cop

47:01.166 --> 47:04.208

And if he breaks the curse for himself...

48:08.625 --> 48:10.708
Maybe it breaks it for me!

48:10.708 --> 48:12.666
- All of us! All of us.
- All of us, girl.

48:12.666 --> 48:14.583
I don't know nothing about no curse,

48:14.583 --> 48:16.458
and I don't know about no magic,
but I do know one thing,

48:16.458 --> 48:18.000
that I ain't scared of no elf.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.458
- That's right, Chris.
- That's right. You tell her.

48:20.458 --> 48:23.791
Yeah, too bad she not hearing you
say it right to her face.

49:47.625 --> 49:49.083
Good job, bonbon.

49:49.083 --> 49:50.791
Let me head up top.

49:51.750 --> 49:52.875
Whatever you do, don't peel out!

49:55.250 --> 49:57.625
This is amazing!

50:05.083 --> 50:07.250
So that's how you want to play?

50:07.250 --> 50:08.541
Game on.

50:08.541 --> 50:10.458
I'm the king of the...

50:11.541 --> 50:13.375

Hey!

Whoa-whoa-whoa! Hey! That was fun.

50:20.541 --> 50:22.041
All right, just don't take
any more turns like that.

50:22.041 --> 50:24.125
I don't know if I can take it!

50:39.791 --> 50:41.791
Two normal-size people
driving down the street.

50:41.791 --> 50:43.583
Hello, neighbors. Hello, neighborhood.

50:48.750 --> 50:52.083
Uh-uh. Is this a broker version
of where we came from?

50:52.083 --> 50:53.875
I have motion sickness.

50:53.875 --> 50:55.125
Girl, don't throw up on me.

50:58.375 --> 50:59.500
Ow.

51:03.458 --> 51:08.458
Ah, at last, free from the torment
of eternal Christma--

51:17.750 --> 51:19.625
- Oh.
- Ew.

51:19.625 --> 51:22.083
I'm-a burn up everything in here.

51:24.750 --> 51:26.708
- Oh, run! -Paper tidal wave!
- Incoming!

51:26.708 --> 51:28.000
- Hop it! Hop it!

51:28.000 --> 51:30.666
- Ow, my bustle!
- Ow, my everything.

51:32.208 --> 51:34.833
You're quite the home decorator, Holly.

51:41.625 --> 51:44.208
What is this,
some sort of butcher's chart?

51:44.208 --> 51:46.875
Oh, my God, it's Operation!

51:46.875 --> 51:48.583
Yo, I love Operation, dawg.

51:48.583 --> 51:50.666
Oh, I am flawless. I never get shocked.

51:50.666 --> 51:51.833
Watch this, y'all.

51:51.833 --> 51:53.541
Gary!

51:54.625 --> 51:55.708
- Oh, no.
- S-Sweeney Todd!

51:55.708 --> 51:58.166
- Oh, my God, Gary, are you okay?
- Do I look okay?

51:58.166 --> 52:01.250
- Ay. Ay. Ay. Ay.

52:01.250 --> 52:03.666
- I actually think it's an improvement.
- Eh.

52:09.250 --> 52:11.333
Hey, hold up.

52:11.333 --> 52:12.833
This is important.

52:12.833 --> 52:14.000
Dad, come on, seriously?

52:14.000 --> 52:18.291
Do you have any idea
how bad that could've been?

52:18.291 --> 52:21.041
- I can explain.
- And why were there chickens?

52:21.041 --> 52:22.291
Did you bring the chickens?

52:22.291 --> 52:23.791
No.

52:23.791 --> 52:25.208
Well, kinda, yeah.

52:26.291 --> 52:29.250
Oh, my God.

52:30.500 --> 52:31.541
This about the contest?

52:31.541 --> 52:32.875
Are you ki--

52:32.875 --> 52:35.500
Chr... Chris...

52:35.500 --> 52:39.583
you are supposed to be
spending this time looking for a job.

52:39.583 --> 52:41.583
Why Dad looking for another job?

52:41.583 --> 52:43.458
Did you quit?

52:43.458 --> 52:44.625
You got fired?

52:44.625 --> 52:46.666
No, I got laid off.

52:46.666 --> 52:48.916
And I didn't want to tell you guys
because I didn't want to ruin Christmas.

52:48.916 --> 52:51.000
But it's fine. It's fine.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.875
Seriously, fine.

52:52.875 --> 52:54.333
As long as I keep my job.

52:54.333 --> 52:57.208
I'm gonna show you guys something, and
when I show you what I'm gonna show you,

52:57.208 --> 52:59.083
all your questions are gonna be answered.

52:59.083 --> 53:04.000
But when I show you this, don't freak out.

53:05.625 --> 53:07.625
- Come on. You got to see this.
- Careful. Careful, you guys.

53:07.625 --> 53:09.208
- Holly, seriously?
- What are you doing?

53:09.208 --> 53:11.250
What is happening?

53:11.250 --> 53:13.750
Oh, my God, look at this.

53:13.750 --> 53:14.958
What is this?

53:14.958 --> 53:16.916
- What am I looking at?
- This is what I want you to see.

53:16.916 --> 53:19.625

53:19.625 --> 53:21.666

53:25.833 --> 53:27.791
- Oh, my God.

53:32.500 --> 53:35.041
Ooh, look at you, hot stuff,
looking like a tall drink of water.

53:35.041 --> 53:36.958
- Gulp, gulp, baby.
Step back. Step back.

53:36.958 --> 53:38.750
- Step back.
- What'd you just say about my mom?

53:38.750 --> 53:40.583
Hey, I know you see
this fire between us, girl.

53:40.583 --> 53:43.125
- Is he talking to me?
- Hey, watch it.

53:43.125 --> 53:44.875
- That's my wife.
- For now, brother.

53:44.875 --> 53:46.833
Oh, I am so sorry.

53:46.833 --> 53:49.125
Hi. Um, nice to meet you.

53:49.125 --> 53:50.625
I can only apologize for Gary.

53:50.625 --> 53:51.916
He's the worst.

53:51.916 --> 53:53.958
She feel that heat, though.
She feel that heat!

53:53.958 --> 53:55.500
That tree is feeling the heat!

53:55.500 --> 53:56.583
- God, watch it! The tree!
- Hey.

53:56.583 --> 53:58.083
It's on fire.

See, you're burning stuff down.

53:59.583 --> 54:01.458
Watch what you're doing, Gary.

54:01.458 --> 54:03.416
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, it's kind of my thing, though.

54:03.416 --> 54:04.500
- Woo-hoo!

54:04.500 --> 54:06.291
Check out the new whip, everybody.

Pip!

54:10.416 --> 54:12.375
Hi-ho, cheerio, Holly.

Okay, Chris...

We're all named after Christmas stuff?

54:45.250 --> 54:47.666
-  Oh, my God.
Seriously?

54:47.666 --> 54:49.541
Just now figuring this out?

54:49.541 --> 54:51.208
I have to admit that was my idea.

54:51.208 --> 54:53.500
- Yeah, it was all him.
- I kind of talked Mom into that.

54:53.500 --> 54:55.208
Mm, he did.
Chris, can I talk to you for a second?

54:55.208 --> 54:56.375
Oh, she's talking through gritted teeth.

54:56.375 --> 54:57.500
- You know what that means.
- We can talk right now.

54:57.500 --> 54:59.333
Think we should do it a little privately.

54:59.333 --> 55:01.041
Just kind of step away for a second.

55:01.041 --> 55:02.291
Mm, someone's in trouble.

55:02.291 --> 55:05.416
No, no one's in trouble.

55:05.416 --> 55:08.250
What are those and why are they talking?

55:08.250 --> 55:10.416
They're little Christmas people.

55:10.416 --> 55:11.958
Yes, I can tell, but that's insane.

55:11.958 --> 55:13.791
I mean, do you wind them up?
Is there a battery?

55:13.791 --> 55:14.875
I don't got no battery, but you can check.

55:14.875 --> 55:16.000
No, there's no battery.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.708
They're-they're little Christmas people
that have come to life.

55:18.708 --> 55:21.083
- It seems scary to me.
- What's scary about it?

55:21.083 --> 55:23.375
They're talking and they're little, and
that little one keeps flirting with me.

55:23.375 --> 55:25.750
Hey, I'm scary at first, baby, but...

55:25.750 --> 55:27.750
I'm telling you right now,
you say one more thing,

55:27.750 --> 55:30.291
- I'm gonna flick you into next Christmas.
- Ooh, girl.

55:30.291 --> 55:31.708
Oh, you smell good.

55:31.708 --> 55:32.916
You don't think this is amazing?

55:32.916 --> 55:34.625
No, it doesn't feel magical.
It feels terrifying.

55:34.625 --> 55:36.625
Please don't touch that! Don't touch it.

55:36.625 --> 55:38.041
It's okay. They're--

55:38.041 --> 55:39.166
It's safe.

55:39.166 --> 55:40.583
- You know what this is?
- Mm?

55:40.583 --> 55:42.375
This is Christmas magic.

55:42.375 --> 55:44.750
Well, I'm magic.
I don't know what Gary is. -

55:44.750 --> 55:47.125
Mostly, like, gross.

55:48.125 --> 55:49.916
That's why I got to find three more rings

55:49.916 --> 55:53.750
before this clock chimes eight times
on Christmas Eve.

55:53.750 --> 55:55.875
- Okay, so Popper...
- Pepper.

55:55.875 --> 55:57.916
- Pepper. Pepper.
- It's Pepper. -It's Pepper.

55:57.916 --> 56:00.875
Pepper will make your wish come true?

56:00.875 --> 56:02.958
Right, then I win. I win the contest,

56:02.958 --> 56:05.083
- and I get $100,000.
- Right.

56:05.083 --> 56:08.333
Then this family has the best Christmas
of all the Christmases ever.

56:08.333 --> 56:11.125
Except for the first one,
which was obviously a biggie.

56:11.125 --> 56:12.541
That was special.

56:12.541 --> 56:14.375
Wait, so that was your wish?

56:14.375 --> 56:16.583
To win Candy Cane Lane?

56:16.583 --> 56:17.916
Not, like-- I don't know-- world peace?

56:17.916 --> 56:19.875
- End hunger?
- End homelessness?

56:19.875 --> 56:21.833
Stop climate change?
Save the polar bears?

56:21.833 --> 56:23.875
- New Drake album?
- Oh. -Oh, I love Drake.

56:23.875 --> 56:25.083
- Me, too.

56:25.083 --> 56:27.291
Okay, point taken,
but I wasn't thinking like that.

56:27.291 --> 56:28.666
I was thinking about my family.

56:28.666 --> 56:30.708
- Oh.
- That's why I love him.

56:30.708 --> 56:32.583
But remember, if you fail...

56:33.791 --> 56:35.583
If you fail? What?

56:35.583 --> 56:37.083
If I fail, then I don't win.

56:37.083 --> 56:38.958
But we don't have to worry about that.

56:38.958 --> 56:41.166
'Cause I'm gonna find those rings.

56:41.166 --> 56:42.333
- That's right.
- Yeah.

56:42.333 --> 56:44.125
Hopefully.

56:44.125 --> 56:46.416
What you mean, "hopefully"?
Stop being negative.

56:48.125 --> 56:49.375
All right.

56:56.125 --> 56:57.791
Stapler.

57:01.166 --> 57:02.250
Stapler!

57:02.250 --> 57:04.333
Somebody better find that stapler.

57:04.333 --> 57:05.958
Come on, guys, who used it last?

57:13.625 --> 57:15.041
Over here, you little piper.

57:16.791 --> 57:18.541
There you go.

57:18.541 --> 57:20.083
You little suckers.

57:21.083 --> 57:22.083
Gotcha.

57:22.083 --> 57:23.625
Right there, lady.

57:23.625 --> 57:25.375
There you go.

57:25.375 --> 57:27.208
All right.

57:27.208 --> 57:29.041
So, we got two rings.

57:29.041 --> 57:30.791
The first one is from...

57:30.791 --> 57:32.375
- ♪ Two turtledoves ♪

57:32.375 --> 57:35.625
Yep. And the second one
is from the three...

57:35.625 --> 57:38.125
- ♪ Three French hens ♪
- I was gonna say it.

57:38.125 --> 57:42.500
Okay. And we also met...

57:42.500 --> 57:44.083
- ♪ Seven swans a-swimming ♪
And the six geese a...

57:44.083 --> 57:45.375
♪ Six geese a-laying ♪

57:45.375 --> 57:47.708
That looks just like her.
I'm-a burn her ass up.

57:47.708 --> 57:49.791
Firepit that ass.

57:49.791 --> 57:51.666
- Hey, Gary. No, no, no, no.
- Yes.

57:51.666 --> 57:53.583
Mm-mm. She going to hell.

57:53.583 --> 57:55.500
Gary, put the fire down.

57:55.500 --> 57:57.166
Aw.

57:57.166 --> 57:58.583
Question.

57:59.750 --> 58:02.083
So, Dad, Dad, who is this Pepper person?

58:02.083 --> 58:04.375
She some old girlfriend or something?

58:04.375 --> 58:06.791
'Cause I met one of those before,
and she was still mad.

58:06.791 --> 58:08.000
She's not wrong.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.458
No, no, she's not an old girlfriend.

58:10.458 --> 58:11.583
She's an elf.

58:11.583 --> 58:14.291
And she fights dirty,
so we got a new house rule:

58:14.291 --> 58:16.500
Nobody can leave this house
till Christmas Eve.

58:16.500 --> 58:17.958
- What? -What? -Wait, what?
- Fine with me.

58:17.958 --> 58:19.791
- Dad, I got band.
- You're gonna have to skip band.

58:19.791 --> 58:23.125
Okay, more importantly, I have a
track meet, and a scout's gonna be there.

58:23.125 --> 58:24.833
- Oh.
- Really? A scout?

58:24.833 --> 58:26.375
- From USC?

58:28.333 --> 58:29.541
Yeah.

58:30.541 --> 58:31.958
Okay, we can't skip that.

58:31.958 --> 58:34.000
We're gonna all go to that together.
I'll just have to keep you safe.

58:34.000 --> 58:35.625
Yeah, and we're gonna do this as a family.

58:35.625 --> 58:38.125
- We should split up.
- What do you mean, we should split up?

58:38.125 --> 58:40.375
Have you ever watched a horror film?

58:40.375 --> 58:42.958
When you split up, somebody dies.

58:42.958 --> 58:44.125
That's true.

58:44.125 --> 58:46.833
Yeah, a Black person always die first,
and all y'all Black.

58:48.041 --> 58:51.125
I've searched online,
and no one has heard of this Pepper.

58:51.125 --> 58:53.291
I think we should wake up tomorrow morning
and call the police.

58:53.291 --> 58:54.875
And tell them what?

58:54.875 --> 58:57.250
And tell them the truth,
that some sadistic little elf

58:57.250 --> 58:59.666
is targeting our family.

58:59.666 --> 59:01.916
Yeah, I just said it out loud.
It's not gonna work.

59:01.916 --> 59:04.208
I just got to find those damn rings.

59:04.208 --> 59:06.916
Can you please forget the rings, Chris?

59:06.916 --> 59:10.875
Seriously, just give the-the village back
and all those little tiny figurines

59:10.875 --> 59:13.375
and say you're sorry
for whatever you did to piss her off,

59:13.375 --> 59:14.541
and then be done with it.

59:14.541 --> 59:17.083
It's just not that simple, Carol.

59:17.083 --> 59:19.625
What are you not telling me?

59:19.625 --> 59:21.958
There's something you're not telling me.
What are you not telling me?

59:21.958 --> 59:25.416
Carol, I just can't walk away.

59:26.750 --> 59:28.166
I have to.

59:29.500 --> 59:30.875
Okay.

59:30.875 --> 59:32.000
Okay, I hear you.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.250
- Okay?
- Okay, yes.

59:33.250 --> 59:35.458
- All right.
- We made a promise to each other.

59:35.458 --> 59:37.500
I'm glad you're saying this.
I was about to remind you.

59:37.500 --> 59:39.333
- Oh, you were gonna remind me?
- Before you said it.

59:39.333 --> 59:40.875
- Okay.
- Okay.

59:40.875 --> 59:42.791
- Okay?
- So-- Yes, I'm gonna show up for you

59:42.791 --> 59:44.458
because we are on the same team

59:44.458 --> 59:46.208
- with each other.
- Yes, because of this, we show up.

59:46.208 --> 59:48.666
- We show up for each other.
- Right, we show up for each other.

59:48.666 --> 59:52.958
No matter how strange, no matter
how crazy, we show up for each other.

59:52.958 --> 59:54.500
I don't think those were in the vows.

59:54.500 --> 59:55.708
I'm putting that in now.

59:55.708 --> 59:58.458
No matter how strange or how crazy,
we support each other. -Okay.

59:59.541 --> 01:00:01.000
So I got your back.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.666
We're gonna get this done.

01:00:02.666 --> 01:00:05.291
- And that's why I love you so much.
- I love you, too.

01:00:05.291 --> 01:00:06.375
Mwah.

01:00:06.375 --> 01:00:07.791
Give me another one.

01:00:07.791 --> 01:00:10.833
Ooh, I love both of y'all right now.
How strange it 'bout to get?

01:00:10.833 --> 01:00:12.958
- No! No!
- Hey.

01:00:12.958 --> 01:00:15.125
- No! Chris.
- I'm-I'm-a handle him.

01:00:15.125 --> 01:00:17.833
Oh, don't cup me, brother,
not on the holiday.

01:00:17.833 --> 01:00:21.291
I'm gonna d-deal with our little friend,
and I'll be back in a second.

01:00:25.666 --> 01:00:26.916
All right, you got the letter?

01:00:26.916 --> 01:00:28.916
Yes.
Disarmed.

01:00:31.291 --> 01:00:32.541
PIP
Here we go.

01:00:34.541 --> 01:00:36.666
You're very brave, Holly.

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:38.541
Thank you, Pip.

01:00:38.541 --> 01:00:40.083
I'm quite scared myself.

01:00:40.083 --> 01:00:44.291
You see, Pepper will never stop
until she finds us.

01:00:44.291 --> 01:00:46.125
It's okay.

01:00:46.125 --> 01:00:47.750
We can protect each other.

01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:49.458
That's very kind of you, love.

01:00:49.458 --> 01:00:51.250
I'm just so tiny, you see.

01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:53.125
I am, too.

01:00:53.125 --> 01:00:55.583
Is that the mailbox?

01:00:57.083 --> 01:00:58.791
It is.

01:01:00.541 --> 01:01:02.291
We got this, love.

01:01:03.375 --> 01:01:04.916
Thank you, Pip.

01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:12.875
Well, and Bob's your uncle.

01:01:12.875 --> 01:01:14.791
I don't have an uncle.

01:01:14.791 --> 01:01:17.208
It's an idiom, love.
What's that?

01:01:17.208 --> 01:01:18.458
A figure of speech.

01:01:18.458 --> 01:01:20.833
You ever hear of a writer
called Charlie Dickens?

01:01:20.833 --> 01:01:22.250
No.
Oh?

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:24.041
My mother knew his mother.

01:01:29.041 --> 01:01:30.625
Yoo-hoo.

01:01:32.458 --> 01:01:35.750
Where are you,
my naughty little stocking stuffers?

01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:37.750
Pip?

01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:40.333
Don't move. Don't even breathe.

01:01:40.333 --> 01:01:41.416
Cordelia?

01:01:41.416 --> 01:01:43.458
Lamp boy?

01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:46.625
Oh.

01:01:46.625 --> 01:01:49.500
My Santa. It's a slum.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.166
Oh, what a downgrade.

01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:57.208
Come out, my little villagers.

01:01:57.208 --> 01:01:58.458
It's me.

01:01:58.458 --> 01:02:00.166
Where are you?

01:02:00.166 --> 01:02:01.875
Hello?

01:02:02.875 --> 01:02:04.166
- Mm.
-  Please, no.

01:02:04.166 --> 01:02:05.833
I want to tell you a bedtime story.

01:02:07.916 --> 01:02:09.958
But you need to come out.

01:02:09.958 --> 01:02:11.708
Where are you?

01:02:17.208 --> 01:02:19.958
I'm starting to get angry.

01:02:19.958 --> 01:02:22.375
Feels like you're hiding on purpose.

01:02:24.166 --> 01:02:25.666
Well, look at this.

01:02:30.166 --> 01:02:31.833
Is that me?

01:02:31.833 --> 01:02:33.791
I'm stunning.

01:02:36.833 --> 01:02:38.375
All right, I'm leaving.

01:02:39.458 --> 01:02:40.541
Or am I?

01:02:43.375 --> 01:02:45.958
♪ Dashing through the snow ♪

01:02:45.958 --> 01:02:47.791
♪ In a one-horse open sleigh ♪

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.458
How's that song go again?

01:02:52.458 --> 01:02:54.875
Does anyone know the lyrics?

01:02:54.875 --> 01:02:56.458
♪ O'er the fields we go ♪

01:02:57.541 --> 01:02:59.458
♪ Laughing all the way ♪

01:02:59.458 --> 01:03:00.958
- ♪ Ha ha ha! ♪
- Oh.

01:03:00.958 --> 01:03:03.416
Aha!

01:03:05.791 --> 01:03:07.833
You know, he can't protect you forever.

01:03:07.833 --> 01:03:10.875
He'll never find the last ring.

01:03:10.875 --> 01:03:16.916
For the king of Christmas to save himself,
he needs the one upon the shelf.

01:03:18.375 --> 01:03:21.791
I'll be back when the clock strikes 8:00.

01:03:23.125 --> 01:03:26.333
And then you'll learn your tragic...

01:03:27.791 --> 01:03:29.500
Destiny?

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:30.750
Inevitable outcome?

01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:32.625
No, that's not it either.

01:03:38.916 --> 01:03:41.875
Okay, girls, this is just a normal relay.

01:03:41.875 --> 01:03:46.250
Yeah, totally normal for
a Notre Dame scout to be watching us.

01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:48.625
Joy, does your dad know?

01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:53.291
Hey, Joy!

01:03:53.291 --> 01:03:54.500
We see you!

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:56.416
Look, just don't worry about him.

01:03:59.166 --> 01:04:02.125
I think those are those scouts
from USC up there.

01:04:02.125 --> 01:04:03.916
- Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Take a look. See, right where--

01:04:03.916 --> 01:04:05.500
That's them, right?

01:04:07.583 --> 01:04:09.083
Is that them?

01:04:09.083 --> 01:04:11.125
- Yes?
- Yeah.

01:04:11.125 --> 01:04:12.916
- Yes. It is? It is?
- The middle one, the middle one.

01:04:12.916 --> 01:04:14.125
- Hey!
- Oh.

01:04:16.083 --> 01:04:17.125
Yo!

01:04:17.125 --> 01:04:18.666
- Fight on!
- Okay. Oh, my God.

01:04:18.666 --> 01:04:19.833
Whoo!

01:04:24.416 --> 01:04:25.791
Stop. Yeah.

01:04:28.208 --> 01:04:30.333
I'm getting sick of this.

01:04:31.416 --> 01:04:32.458
- Hello.
Squawk.

01:04:32.458 --> 01:04:34.500
Clock's ticking, naughty chicken.

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.125
Polly doesn't just want a cracker.
She's after all of you.

01:04:37.125 --> 01:04:39.708
No Carver is safe. No Carver is safe.

01:04:39.708 --> 01:04:42.125
- What is that?

01:04:42.125 --> 01:04:44.833
Some prank call, like I don't have
enough problems. -

01:04:44.833 --> 01:04:46.916
Sounds like a parrot.

01:04:48.375 --> 01:04:49.666
That's it.

01:04:50.833 --> 01:04:52.958
- The birds. -What?
Birds?

01:04:52.958 --> 01:04:54.166
The calling birds.

01:04:56.375 --> 01:04:59.125
- She's messing with us.
- Okay.

01:04:59.125 --> 01:05:01.083
- What do we do?
- Look, hey.

01:05:01.083 --> 01:05:03.000
Take these binoculars,
look around the crowd.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.125
- You spot anything, say something.
- On it.

01:05:05.125 --> 01:05:07.416
- You think she's here?
- She could be. She could be anywhere.

01:05:09.208 --> 01:05:10.500
Oh. Hey.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.416
Hey, look at that.
Nick, that's your math teacher.

01:05:12.416 --> 01:05:15.416
- No, it's not.
- Mr. Benedetto. Hey. Hi.

01:05:15.416 --> 01:05:17.791
Oh, my God, sweetheart. Hey.

01:05:17.791 --> 01:05:19.416
He's probably excited 'cause
you're doing so well in math, sweetheart.

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:21.000
- Yeah, I'm doing, I'm doing good in music.
- Yeah? Uh-huh.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.708
He's coming to say congratulations.

01:05:22.708 --> 01:05:24.291
Hey! Hi there.

01:05:24.291 --> 01:05:26.750
- I see you. Hi.
- Okay. Okay.

01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:28.750
- I'll be right there.
- Hey.

01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:30.500
Where's Nick?

01:06:39.041 --> 01:06:41.458
- There she goes. There she goes.
- Come on, Joy!

01:06:41.458 --> 01:06:43.208
- Come on. Come on, babe.
- Come on, Joy!

01:07:13.666 --> 01:07:14.750
- Oh. -Got a minute.
- Come on, Joy!

01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:16.708
- I need to talk to you about Nick.
- Smoke 'em, Joy!

01:07:16.708 --> 01:07:18.208
Yeah, you want to praise my boy.

01:07:18.208 --> 01:07:19.458
- Run, girl, run!
- Come on, come on.

01:07:19.458 --> 01:07:21.833
- Whoo!
- Praise your boy for failing my class?

01:07:21.833 --> 01:07:23.208
- Failing. He's not failing.
- Come on, now!

01:07:23.208 --> 01:07:25.208
If he was failing,
I would know he was failing. -Fight on!

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.458
- Is he failing?
- Whoo!

01:07:29.458 --> 01:07:32.333
- Oh, yeah. Exponentially.
Who's failing? What?

01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:42.625
I don't know where Nick is.

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:45.250
Uh, there you go. Need I say more?

01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:46.416
No, you should not.

01:07:46.416 --> 01:07:48.041
Sports.

01:07:48.041 --> 01:07:50.250
A topic I know nothing about.

01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:51.791
But I did my research last night,

01:07:51.791 --> 01:07:55.666
and I looked up some of
the greatest sports icons of all time.

01:07:55.666 --> 01:07:58.041
The likes of...

01:07:58.041 --> 01:07:59.916
Wade Gretzky...

01:08:01.166 --> 01:08:03.458
...and Tiger Wools.

01:08:04.541 --> 01:08:07.583
And of course the classic trio of

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:10.541
Le, Bron and James.

01:08:10.541 --> 01:08:12.625
And the greatest of all time...

01:08:13.875 --> 01:08:15.958
...Michael B. Jordan.

01:08:15.958 --> 01:08:19.000
And do you know what they would say
if they were here right now?

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.041
They would say this is not a game.

01:08:21.041 --> 01:08:23.708
We're not running in circles out here.

01:08:23.708 --> 01:08:25.125
We're not passing the baton.

01:08:25.125 --> 01:08:30.208
Life is about taking the baton
and shoving it right up

01:08:30.208 --> 01:08:32.666
the competition's chimney!

01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:37.041
That was your cue. Go, go, go!

01:08:37.041 --> 01:08:38.541
- Run!

01:09:02.416 --> 01:09:03.791
Ring.

01:09:03.791 --> 01:09:05.666
Milkmaid?

01:09:05.666 --> 01:09:07.125
Hi.

01:09:10.625 --> 01:09:12.166
Got milk?

01:09:23.958 --> 01:09:25.875
- Hey! -Oh!

01:09:25.875 --> 01:09:27.541
Go.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:32.541
What the hell are you doing?

01:09:38.916 --> 01:09:41.291
You've got no drip.

01:09:45.541 --> 01:09:47.541
You have got to be kidding me.

01:09:47.541 --> 01:09:49.041
I'm coming, Joy! I got you!

01:09:51.791 --> 01:09:53.666
Hey, this doesn't count!

01:09:53.666 --> 01:09:54.750
Hey, man, what...

01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:12.708
All right, now, I ain't no punk.

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:15.125
- What?

01:10:15.125 --> 01:10:17.458
Hey! Why y'all messing with me?

01:10:17.458 --> 01:10:19.333
Y'all should be working
for Cirque du Soleil.

01:10:20.791 --> 01:10:22.291
Run, Joy!
I don't know if

01:10:22.291 --> 01:10:23.875
- you understand how important math is.
- Run!

01:10:23.875 --> 01:10:24.958
...nine, ten.

01:10:24.958 --> 01:10:26.291
Mom, ten lords a-leaping.

01:10:31.208 --> 01:10:33.750
Joy. What are you doing?

01:10:41.041 --> 01:10:42.750
Why y'all dressed like Prince?

01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:45.375
Hey, Chris, the ring!

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:46.541
You got to stop him!

01:10:46.541 --> 01:10:48.583
Math is at the heart
of everything. It's vitally important.

01:10:48.583 --> 01:10:49.875
- Nick...
- Listen to me, Friar Tuck.

01:10:49.875 --> 01:10:52.125
- I need you to shut it!

01:10:52.125 --> 01:10:54.166
Stand by.

01:11:11.666 --> 01:11:14.541
Ha! Yes! Yes!

01:11:16.333 --> 01:11:18.375
What were you saying?

01:11:19.458 --> 01:11:21.208
I... I... Oh.

01:12:13.083 --> 01:12:14.666
That's right!

01:12:14.666 --> 01:12:17.666
I was about to start whipping
everybody's ass up in here!

01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:19.458
Y'all got off easy this time!

01:12:20.791 --> 01:12:23.375
- Joy, that was amazing. That was amazing.
- Thanks, Dad.

01:12:23.375 --> 01:12:25.083
You got it. You got the ring.

01:12:25.083 --> 01:12:26.416
- Are sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm good, Mom.

01:12:26.416 --> 01:12:27.541
- You're okay. All right.
- Thank you.

01:12:27.541 --> 01:12:29.250
Hey, oh, there's that scout.

01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:31.041
- Where? Oh. -Wait, Dad, don't.

01:12:31.041 --> 01:12:33.375
Hey, how about that? Did you see that?

01:12:33.375 --> 01:12:35.791
Did you see what she did out there?
Wasn't she amazing?

01:12:35.791 --> 01:12:37.041
Look, listen.

01:12:37.041 --> 01:12:39.666
It's not my policy
to talk to parents, okay?

01:12:39.666 --> 01:12:41.583
Or an athlete at these events.

01:12:41.583 --> 01:12:43.708
I'm just here to observe. That's it.

01:12:43.708 --> 01:12:45.583
Well, consider yourself lucky.
You got a chance to observe her.

01:12:45.583 --> 01:12:46.958
But did you see what she did?

01:12:46.958 --> 01:12:48.375
I did. I did.

01:12:48.375 --> 01:12:51.791
I counted, uh,
20 violations and infractions.

01:12:51.791 --> 01:12:53.666
Well, I-I promise,

01:12:53.666 --> 01:12:55.000
- I don't usually run like this.
- Yeah.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.583
Look, if she could run that fast with all
those obstacles and hurdles coming at her,

01:12:59.583 --> 01:13:02.083
imagine how good she'll do
in a USC uniform.

01:13:02.083 --> 01:13:03.666
I hope so. I do.

01:13:03.666 --> 01:13:05.625
'Cause she's not running for us.

01:13:05.625 --> 01:13:06.750
- Oh.
- Notre Dame?

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:08.875
Nobody want to go to Notre Dame.

01:13:10.375 --> 01:13:12.000
Well, she's definitely not.

01:13:16.875 --> 01:13:18.375
What's going on?

01:13:18.375 --> 01:13:21.041
Holy cow! Holy...

01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:26.416
I don't want to talk about it.

01:13:27.708 --> 01:13:30.958
So you lied about
how you're doing in math?

01:13:30.958 --> 01:13:33.125
It wasn't a lie. It was a spin.

01:13:33.125 --> 01:13:35.625
Yeah, now, how far you expect
to get in life with an attitude like that?

01:13:35.625 --> 01:13:36.916
I don't know.

01:13:36.916 --> 01:13:39.416
I'm thinking president.

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:42.833
Something big. Big things.

01:13:42.833 --> 01:13:45.208
- This boy. I can't.
- Look.

01:13:45.208 --> 01:13:47.250
Only reason I didn't tell you
I was a loser in math

01:13:47.250 --> 01:13:48.958
is 'cause I know
how you feel about losers.

01:13:54.833 --> 01:13:58.791
And, Dad, just as a reminder,
I can speak for myself.

01:13:58.791 --> 01:14:01.625
Excuse me.
Don't you even try to make this about me.

01:14:01.625 --> 01:14:03.291
Okay? USC scout.

01:14:03.291 --> 01:14:05.375
That guy was from Notre Dame,
and you knew it.

01:14:05.375 --> 01:14:06.708
Yes.

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:08.166
Okay? I don't want to go to USC, okay?

01:14:08.166 --> 01:14:10.541
I-I don't want to come home
for dinner every night.

01:14:10.541 --> 01:14:12.500
I want my own life, away from you.

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:13.666
Hey.

01:14:13.666 --> 01:14:18.083
There is nothing wrong with that, but
you need to be honest with your parents.

01:14:18.083 --> 01:14:21.333
Do you two even know how hard that I work

01:14:21.333 --> 01:14:23.708
so that you can have
the best of everything, the best in life,

01:14:23.708 --> 01:14:26.000
the best Christmas?

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.541
Everything that I do, I do for you.

01:14:27.541 --> 01:14:29.875
Oh, no, no, no. You do this for yourself.

01:14:29.875 --> 01:14:32.500
All this Christmas stuff,
this isn't for us.

01:14:34.291 --> 01:14:35.833
Not anymore.

01:14:35.833 --> 01:14:37.500
It's all for you.

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:39.166
You-- yeah, y-you say
that you want our help,

01:14:39.166 --> 01:14:41.708
but you really just want to do it yourself
and then have us stand here and go,

01:14:41.708 --> 01:14:45.291
"Wow, isn't Dad so amazing?
He's number one!"

01:14:46.625 --> 01:14:47.916
Hey.

01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:51.291
Okay, that's not helping anything.

01:14:51.291 --> 01:14:52.416
Hey.

01:14:54.541 --> 01:14:56.166
We. We do the work.

01:14:56.166 --> 01:14:57.708
- I know we do the work.
- Okay, okay.

01:14:57.708 --> 01:15:00.208
Okay, but, you know, not right now.

01:15:07.083 --> 01:15:11.416
Look, everything you said
out there was true. All right?

01:15:11.416 --> 01:15:15.375
I want to apologize for a lot of things.

01:15:15.375 --> 01:15:19.208
And I haven't told you the whole truth.

01:15:19.208 --> 01:15:20.708
If I find all the rings, I win.

01:15:20.708 --> 01:15:21.916
Yeah?

01:15:21.916 --> 01:15:23.583
But if I don't...

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:29.958
...then I get turned into one of them.

01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:32.166
- What?
- Dad, what?

01:15:32.166 --> 01:15:34.125
Oh, my God, Christopher.

01:15:34.125 --> 01:15:35.333
Gary, you already knew that.

01:15:35.333 --> 01:15:37.583
I know. It's still a big reveal.
Girl, I'm in the moment.

01:15:37.583 --> 01:15:39.291
- No.
- Dad!

01:15:43.791 --> 01:15:45.125
Hey. What do you mean?

01:15:45.125 --> 01:15:47.000
You're gonna be one of those little guys?
Forever?

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.625
- Forever.
- Why didn't you tell me?

01:15:48.625 --> 01:15:51.166
'Cause I thought that I could,
you know, fix this by myself.

01:15:51.166 --> 01:15:53.458
By yourself?

01:15:53.458 --> 01:15:54.583
Oh, my God, Chris.

01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:56.500
Now they gonna turn me into a little...

01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:58.416
- Don't cry.
- I'm gonna be all tiny.

01:15:58.416 --> 01:16:00.500
I would break you.

01:16:06.666 --> 01:16:09.666
You're not gonna let her take my dad,
are you, Pip?

01:16:09.666 --> 01:16:12.500
Not if I can help it, love.

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.666
Oh, little bonbon.

01:16:14.666 --> 01:16:17.041
I'm not crying. My eyes just sweat
when I see something adorable.

01:16:17.041 --> 01:16:18.125
You know what I mean?

01:16:18.125 --> 01:16:19.958
No, sweetheart.

01:16:19.958 --> 01:16:21.958
No. Get up. Get up.

01:16:21.958 --> 01:16:23.666
We are not gonna let her turn your dad

01:16:23.666 --> 01:16:26.958
into one of those weird,
old-timey Happy Meal toys.

01:16:26.958 --> 01:16:28.666
Not like-- No offense. I'm sorry.

01:16:28.666 --> 01:16:30.916
- None taken.
- A little taken.

01:16:30.916 --> 01:16:32.916
Mom is right.

01:16:32.916 --> 01:16:34.541
We're in this together.

01:16:34.541 --> 01:16:35.708
We're the Carvers.

01:16:35.708 --> 01:16:37.000
Yeah.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.083
You know what? We are a family.

01:16:39.083 --> 01:16:43.416
We will do this together
because we are the Carvers.

01:16:43.416 --> 01:16:45.166
- We're the Carvers!
- Yeah!

01:16:45.166 --> 01:16:47.791
Technically, you guys are not Carvers.

01:16:47.791 --> 01:16:49.583

Honorary members.

01:16:49.583 --> 01:16:51.000
On a temporary basis.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.708
Temporary honorary Carvers!

01:16:53.708 --> 01:16:54.791
Seriously?

01:16:54.791 --> 01:16:58.375
Hey, these tree creatures
have to have the ring.

01:16:58.375 --> 01:17:00.875
Mm, don't be so sure, guv.

01:17:00.875 --> 01:17:03.083
Pepper's not to be trusted.

01:17:03.083 --> 01:17:06.708
In fact, she was here last night
looking for us.

01:17:06.708 --> 01:17:07.875
Wait, she was in my house?

01:17:07.875 --> 01:17:10.708
And she said
you'd never find the last ring.

01:17:10.708 --> 01:17:13.708
There's always some trick.
That's how she gets you.

01:17:13.708 --> 01:17:16.666
Right when the clock strikes 8:00
and you think you're about to win...

01:17:16.666 --> 01:17:17.750
You lose.

01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:19.875
But she also said something about,

01:17:19.875 --> 01:17:22.458
"Don't forget the nice gift maker."

01:17:22.458 --> 01:17:23.750
Oh, yeah, and,

01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:26.250
"For the king of Christmas
to save himself,

01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:28.458
he needs the one up on the shelf."

01:17:29.541 --> 01:17:30.708
"Up on the shelf"?

01:17:30.708 --> 01:17:32.291
What does, what does that mean?
What does that mean?

01:17:32.291 --> 01:17:35.125
What? Seriously, you guys?

01:17:35.125 --> 01:17:36.250
Elf on the Shelf.

01:17:36.250 --> 01:17:37.666
- Duh. -Oh.
- Oh, elf. Yes.

01:17:37.666 --> 01:17:38.750
Ah, that's it.

01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:41.125
Elves make gifts. Pepper's the elf.

01:17:41.125 --> 01:17:43.916
- Pepper has the last ring.
- Pepper has the last ring.

01:17:46.333 --> 01:17:47.750
- Huh?

01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:49.000
Do you see this?

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.083
How nice is it to have some help
from your family?

01:17:51.083 --> 01:17:53.666
Yeah, it's good to have
some help from your family.

01:17:53.666 --> 01:17:57.083
Right? And what you need is
an operational manager, and that's all me.

01:17:58.208 --> 01:18:00.791
Follow your mother.
I have ideas. Let's go.

01:18:00.791 --> 01:18:02.333
- Come on, you heard your mother. Let's go!
- Yeah!

01:18:04.083 --> 01:18:05.416
- What is she doing?

01:18:05.416 --> 01:18:06.666
She's in the zone.

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:11.750
Okay. Okay.

01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:13.458
Okay!

01:18:13.458 --> 01:18:15.916
Listen up!
Here's how it's gonna go down tonight.

01:18:15.916 --> 01:18:19.541
Village people, I want you right here,
front and center.

01:18:19.541 --> 01:18:21.375
To do what?

01:18:21.375 --> 01:18:23.375
You're the bait.

01:18:23.375 --> 01:18:25.000
I liked when Chris was in charge.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.500
I mean, he wasn't effective,
but I felt safer.

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:28.625
No one asked you.

01:18:28.625 --> 01:18:31.125
Yeah, for once, I agree with Gary.

01:18:31.125 --> 01:18:33.875
Do you guys want to catch an elf or not?

01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:36.625
Don't answer it!

01:18:38.875 --> 01:18:40.458
Hey, listen here, you stupid birds.

01:18:40.458 --> 01:18:41.833
Let me tell you something right now.

01:18:41.833 --> 01:18:44.083
We are all coming for you 'cause
you messed with the wrong family.

01:18:44.083 --> 01:18:46.166
- That's right.
- So you better not ever...

01:18:46.166 --> 01:18:47.916
Nick, this is Mr. Benedetto.

01:18:47.916 --> 01:18:49.541
- What the heck is going...

01:18:49.541 --> 01:18:50.916
- That's the wrong number.
Oh.

01:18:50.916 --> 01:18:52.166
Oh.

01:18:52.166 --> 01:18:53.625
Okay, listen up, guys.

01:18:53.625 --> 01:18:57.541
We are gonna need a pulley, plywood

01:18:57.541 --> 01:18:59.500
and string lights,
lots and lots of string lights.

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:01.625
Now you're speaking my love language.

01:19:02.708 --> 01:19:06.583
Hey, babe, do you think you can make
a lasso out of string lights?

01:19:10.041 --> 01:19:11.458
That's my man.

01:19:18.083 --> 01:19:21.291
♪ I'm dripping with the spirit,
I been on a wave ♪

01:19:21.291 --> 01:19:24.416

- Extravaganza Bonanza.

01:19:44.083 --> 01:19:47.333
Now, all week long,
our sponsors have been judging the houses,

01:19:47.333 --> 01:19:51.500
and one of these lucky families will be
declared the winner of Candy Cane Lane.

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:54.833
And receive a check for $100,000.

01:19:54.833 --> 01:19:57.375
- Right?

01:19:57.375 --> 01:19:58.958
Whoo!

01:19:58.958 --> 01:20:01.583
Um... (clears throat) it's not a check.

01:20:01.583 --> 01:20:04.333
It's, uh, prizes that equal $100,000.

01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:05.750
Was that not clear?

01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:08.333
- No, that was absolutely not clear.

01:20:08.333 --> 01:20:09.958
What kind of prizes?

01:20:09.958 --> 01:20:11.375
You know, just see for yourself.

01:20:11.375 --> 01:20:13.625

01:20:13.625 --> 01:20:18.625
Oh, and of course,
gift certificates to Tony's Tacos.

01:20:18.625 --> 01:20:21.833
Live every day like it's Taco Tuesday.

01:20:21.833 --> 01:20:22.916
- Tacos?

01:20:22.916 --> 01:20:25.708
$100,000 in Tony Tacos?

01:20:25.708 --> 01:20:27.416
It's not cash? It's tacos?

01:20:27.416 --> 01:20:29.458
Dad, Dad, just stay focused.

01:20:29.458 --> 01:20:32.375
They are gonna turn you into
a tiny action figure.

01:20:32.375 --> 01:20:33.750
Stay focused on the plan.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.333
Tacos are stupid.

01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:40.416
A hundred grand in tacos?
Oh, God, that's unbelievable.

01:20:40.416 --> 01:20:42.208
You know what else
is unbelievable, Emerson?

01:20:42.208 --> 01:20:43.750
I don't know,
that I haven't fired my agent?

01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:48.000

Okay, go, go, go. Go, go.

01:21:45.416 --> 01:21:46.958
A peppermint.

Hello, old friend.

01:21:57.583 --> 01:22:00.416
Hello, Santa's little devil.

01:22:02.875 --> 01:22:04.416
Going for a spin?

01:22:07.041 --> 01:22:08.208
See if you can catch me.

01:22:16.041 --> 01:22:18.583
Oy! Now!

01:22:24.291 --> 01:22:25.583
Gotcha!

01:22:25.583 --> 01:22:27.708
- Messed with the wrong family!

01:22:27.708 --> 01:22:29.708
Seriously?

01:22:29.708 --> 01:22:31.916
This is the Oompa Loompa that has been
causing all the trouble? What...

01:22:31.916 --> 01:22:33.083
Oh, no.

01:22:33.083 --> 01:22:35.666
I walked right into your trap.

01:22:35.666 --> 01:22:37.041
Or did you walk right into mine?

01:22:37.041 --> 01:22:38.583
What are you talking about?

01:22:38.583 --> 01:22:41.208
Santa's been giving too many nice passes
to all the naughties.

01:22:41.208 --> 01:22:43.833
I'm here to put a little coal
in your stocking.

01:22:45.625 --> 01:22:48.416
- You got some real anger issues.
- Just a little.

01:22:50.625 --> 01:22:51.875
Well, I got the last ring.

01:22:51.875 --> 01:22:53.041
- Winner!
- Yeah!

01:22:53.041 --> 01:22:55.625
I win!

01:22:55.625 --> 01:22:58.666
I win, win, win!

01:22:58.666 --> 01:23:00.208
Did you?

01:23:00.208 --> 01:23:02.791
All right, I get it.
I got a lot to learn about Christmas.

01:23:02.791 --> 01:23:05.416
It's not about what you have
on the outside of your house.

01:23:05.416 --> 01:23:07.458
It's about who you have inside with you.

01:23:07.458 --> 01:23:08.541
Yeah.

01:23:08.541 --> 01:23:10.333
And nothing compares to that.

01:23:10.333 --> 01:23:15.166
Oh, my God, if you do not stop
humansplaining Christmas to me.

01:23:18.458 --> 01:23:20.208
What is that?

01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:37.625
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
It's coming in hot.

01:23:42.333 --> 01:23:43.916
Dad, what is that?

01:23:48.125 --> 01:23:49.208
Peppermint!

01:23:49.208 --> 01:23:50.625
Oh, crap.

01:23:50.625 --> 01:23:52.166
Is that who I think it is?

01:23:53.541 --> 01:23:55.541
Uncle Santa! What's up?!

01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:59.041
I knew Santa was Black, man!

01:23:59.041 --> 01:24:01.791
Oh, my gosh, Black Santa!

01:24:01.791 --> 01:24:03.750
I only see Santa.

01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:05.000
What color is that nutcracker?

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
It's white.

01:24:11.958 --> 01:24:13.416
Santa, we love you!

01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:16.500
- That's Santa Claus.
- It's Santa! Hi, Santa!

01:24:21.208 --> 01:24:22.500
I knew it!

01:24:23.875 --> 01:24:25.166
Peppermint!
- Oh.

01:24:26.583 --> 01:24:28.375
Peppermint?

01:24:29.708 --> 01:24:32.916
Peppermint, you working my last nerve.

01:24:32.916 --> 01:24:34.208
Oh.

01:24:34.208 --> 01:24:36.291
Hey, you.

01:24:36.291 --> 01:24:37.458
Fudge me.

01:24:37.458 --> 01:24:39.791
You look great.

01:24:39.791 --> 01:24:42.208
What's your secret? Less cookies?

01:24:42.208 --> 01:24:44.291
Peppermint, what have you done?

01:24:44.291 --> 01:24:46.666
Well, I know how busy you get
this time of year,

01:24:46.666 --> 01:24:50.416
so I thought I'd just teach a few people
the true meaning of Christmas.

01:24:50.416 --> 01:24:52.375
The person that needs
to learn a thing or two

01:24:52.375 --> 01:24:54.875
- is you!
- What?

01:24:54.875 --> 01:24:57.791
Wow. Santa.

01:24:57.791 --> 01:25:00.083
- It's Santa, right?
- Uh, hello, Christopher.

01:25:00.083 --> 01:25:01.166
Yes, it's me.

01:25:01.166 --> 01:25:02.875
He knows your name.

01:25:02.875 --> 01:25:04.958
I'm... I'm really sorry about all this.

01:25:04.958 --> 01:25:06.500
No problem.

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:08.041
Wow, you're actually really here.

01:25:08.041 --> 01:25:10.916
Hey, listen, Santa, um, I'm good, right?

01:25:10.916 --> 01:25:13.416
'Cause I got all the five gold rings.

01:25:13.416 --> 01:25:14.958
Ah-ah-ah.

01:25:14.958 --> 01:25:17.250
- I never said five.
- Yes, you did.

01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:22.375
"Before the old clock tower goes ding,
you must collect the golden rings."

01:25:22.375 --> 01:25:24.708
- There are five golden rings.
- Uh-huh.

01:25:24.708 --> 01:25:26.541
Are there?

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:38.666
Twelve.

01:25:38.666 --> 01:25:40.333
Dad, there's 12 partridges.

01:25:40.333 --> 01:25:43.458
Why? Why are there 12?

01:25:43.458 --> 01:25:45.250
Oh, no.

01:25:45.250 --> 01:25:48.250
- What?
- That song "The Twelve Days of Christmas,"

01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:49.458
it repeats.

01:25:49.458 --> 01:25:52.000
She always changes the rules.
That's her trick.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.083
That's why no one ever wins.

01:25:54.083 --> 01:25:56.708
Is this a-- some sort of pet entrance?

01:25:56.708 --> 01:26:00.583
You sing it over and over again, and
every time you do, you add another one.

01:26:00.583 --> 01:26:01.875
Oh.

01:26:04.041 --> 01:26:05.500
12 partridges!

01:26:05.500 --> 01:26:07.583
Why... why are we doing math right now?

01:26:14.166 --> 01:26:15.458
And two turtledoves.

01:26:15.458 --> 01:26:17.250
And then it repeats that verse.

01:26:17.250 --> 01:26:18.583
11 times.

01:26:20.125 --> 01:26:21.875
So... so that means there's...

01:26:21.875 --> 01:26:24.125
22 turtledoves!

01:26:24.125 --> 01:26:25.750
So it's not really five golden rings.

01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:27.541
It's 40.

01:26:27.541 --> 01:26:29.166
Forty.

01:26:29.166 --> 01:26:30.833
Oh, my God.

01:26:30.833 --> 01:26:32.250
He's right. How is Nick right?

01:26:32.250 --> 01:26:35.500
I don't know. It's... it's music.

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:36.625
But it's math.

01:26:37.833 --> 01:26:39.416
I'm doing math.

01:26:39.416 --> 01:26:41.000
Is this what y'all call calculus?

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.333
What? It's multiplication, you idiot.

01:26:43.333 --> 01:26:45.500
But you're right, for once.

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:47.000
Wait a minute.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.083
40 rings?

01:26:50.583 --> 01:26:53.208
I got you so good. All of you were like,
"Five? Let's find the five."

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:55.375
It was 40.

01:26:55.375 --> 01:26:56.500
Peppermint.
- Mm.

01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:57.958
Enough is enough.

01:26:57.958 --> 01:27:00.166
No. No, no, no, no, no. No, no.

01:27:00.166 --> 01:27:02.291
He made a deal.
He signed it and everything. Look.

01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:08.791
See?

01:27:08.791 --> 01:27:09.875
Signed it right there.

01:27:09.875 --> 01:27:13.041
And there's nothing you can say or do
because it's a deal.

01:27:13.041 --> 01:27:14.125
A deal is a deal!

01:27:14.125 --> 01:27:16.416
Well, there's a lot of fine print here.

01:27:16.416 --> 01:27:19.250
You can't expect someone
to read all of this.

01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:21.791
Oh, dear.

01:27:21.791 --> 01:27:23.166
I'm afraid she's got you.

01:27:24.333 --> 01:27:26.166
Oh, my God.

01:27:26.166 --> 01:27:28.125
Hey, wait a second, now.
Wait a second, now. -

01:27:28.125 --> 01:27:30.750
You're Santa Claus, so you should be able

01:27:30.750 --> 01:27:32.333
- to veto this or something.
- Yeah.

01:27:32.333 --> 01:27:34.333
Christopher, you signed the receipt.

01:27:34.333 --> 01:27:35.708
That's your name.

01:27:35.708 --> 01:27:38.208
Only you can break the curse.

01:27:39.291 --> 01:27:42.083
♪ Do you hear what I hear? ♪

01:27:53.875 --> 01:27:56.208
Wh-Wh-Where y'all come from?

01:27:58.208 --> 01:28:00.333
- Whoa.
- Everybody, back up.

01:28:02.041 --> 01:28:04.208
Ticktock, ticktock.

01:28:04.208 --> 01:28:05.333
Almost eight o'clock.

01:28:06.416 --> 01:28:08.708
Seriously, you want us
to try to get 40 rings now?

01:28:08.708 --> 01:28:10.958
Oh, no, no, no. I expect you to fail.

01:28:10.958 --> 01:28:13.583
Peppermint, I'm warning you, if...

01:28:13.583 --> 01:28:15.750
No, I'm warning you, old man.

01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:16.875
You've gone soft.

01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:18.833
Well, all that's about to change

01:28:18.833 --> 01:28:21.750
because Peppermint is coming to town!

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.458
Oh!
- Son of a Blitzen!

01:28:24.458 --> 01:28:27.500
Fly, my pretties! Fly!

01:28:38.625 --> 01:28:40.083
She just kick Santa Claus?

01:28:40.083 --> 01:28:41.333
- That's what I saw.

01:28:41.333 --> 01:28:42.541
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God! Oh!

01:28:51.958 --> 01:28:53.875
Ooh, that hurt.

01:28:53.875 --> 01:28:56.500
- Hey, we need more rings.
- Oh, quick, how many do we have?

01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:57.958
- Five.
- Five?

01:28:57.958 --> 01:28:59.750
- Okay, we got five rings.
- That leaves 35.

01:28:59.750 --> 01:29:01.083
Yeah.

01:29:01.083 --> 01:29:03.125
I'm like a math genius, y'all.

01:29:03.125 --> 01:29:04.208
No, sweetie.

01:29:04.208 --> 01:29:05.750
Okay, everybody has to get
as many rings as they can.

01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:08.041
- Yes, okay, split up.
- You said not to split up.

01:29:08.041 --> 01:29:09.750
That only happens in horror movies.

01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:10.958
What do you think this is? Come on.

01:29:10.958 --> 01:29:12.250
Hey, Santa Claus, you all right?

01:29:12.250 --> 01:29:14.208
Are all your elves like this?

01:29:14.208 --> 01:29:17.208
I'm telling you, this generation.

01:29:17.208 --> 01:29:18.791
Brother.

01:29:20.583 --> 01:29:22.208
Where these birds come from?

01:29:31.875 --> 01:29:34.625
Oh, he got you.

01:29:35.791 --> 01:29:38.541
He got you.

01:29:42.083 --> 01:29:45.791
Hey, Santa, are you sure
there isn't anything else you can do?

01:30:06.166 --> 01:30:08.083
- Yes!
- Hell no!

01:30:08.083 --> 01:30:10.000
- Santa Claus!

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.083
Well, maybe you come by the shop sometime.

01:30:12.083 --> 01:30:13.375
Introduce you to the elves.

01:30:13.375 --> 01:30:16.208
We got Cupcake, Twinkle, Dinky...

01:30:16.208 --> 01:30:18.083
Okay, okay, let's hurry this up.

01:30:18.083 --> 01:30:20.958
We got Winky, Dinky, Binky...

01:30:20.958 --> 01:30:22.125
and Stinky.

01:30:22.125 --> 01:30:23.958
He not allowed inside.

01:30:23.958 --> 01:30:26.125
If you looking for scrambled eggs,
I'm telling you,

01:30:26.125 --> 01:30:28.750
it's going down on Candy Cane Lane.

01:30:28.750 --> 01:30:30.208
I could've stayed in the hood for this.

01:30:44.375 --> 01:30:46.500
-  Thanks, neighbor.
-  Oh. All right. Hey.

01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:48.625
All right. All right, Bruce.

01:30:48.625 --> 01:30:50.166
Thank you.

01:30:50.166 --> 01:30:53.541
My window is rolling up so slow.

01:30:53.541 --> 01:30:55.041
I can't do this.

01:31:02.458 --> 01:31:04.541
Hey! Hey!

01:31:07.208 --> 01:31:09.041
Wow.

01:31:10.333 --> 01:31:11.583
You're fast.

01:31:11.583 --> 01:31:13.708
Yeah, it's kind of my thing.

01:31:13.708 --> 01:31:15.583
Mine, too. We should talk.

01:31:52.666 --> 01:31:53.750
Oh, my God.

01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:55.750
Oy, that's dirty pool.

01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:57.875
Pepper know what time it is,
but Chris won't.

01:31:57.875 --> 01:31:59.708
- Okay.
- What we gonna do, just sit here?

01:31:59.708 --> 01:32:02.916
Actually, guys,
I think it's time for me to drive.

01:32:09.875 --> 01:32:11.125
No.

01:32:11.125 --> 01:32:13.875
What? It's not time yet.
We still have five minutes.

01:32:18.666 --> 01:32:19.791
Carol!

01:32:20.791 --> 01:32:22.875
Where's that ring? Excuse me.

01:32:22.875 --> 01:32:24.458
I'm-I'm sorry.

01:32:25.916 --> 01:32:27.041
There it is.

01:32:30.416 --> 01:32:32.416
What are y'all doing?

01:32:39.125 --> 01:32:40.750
Yo, who are these guys?

01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:42.250
Yo, we got to get those rings.

01:32:42.250 --> 01:32:44.708
- Rings? What rings?
- There's a ring on that drum.

01:32:44.708 --> 01:32:46.750
Oh, this the battle of the bands?
Dude, let's go.

01:32:47.875 --> 01:32:50.291
Yo, everybody, bring them in closer.

01:32:50.291 --> 01:32:51.916
Then I can grab the rings.

01:32:53.458 --> 01:32:54.916
Carol!

01:33:09.083 --> 01:33:11.125
Go ahead, Nick.

01:33:20.583 --> 01:33:21.791
What in the world?

01:33:21.791 --> 01:33:23.666
Oh, no!

01:33:23.666 --> 01:33:24.791
Breaking news!

01:33:24.791 --> 01:33:29.041
Brother man who house couldn't light up
the first try, he just shrunk.

01:33:29.041 --> 01:33:31.166
She got me.

01:33:34.833 --> 01:33:37.041
Hey, I still have time.

01:33:41.208 --> 01:33:43.625
Coming through! Watch your step, y'all!

01:33:48.166 --> 01:33:50.791
I don't know what just happened.
I ain't never seen no...

01:33:50.791 --> 01:33:52.041
Where did he go?

01:33:52.041 --> 01:33:53.708
Let 'em get closer. Let 'em get closer.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.833
Drum line, single file.

01:34:01.333 --> 01:34:04.291
Hey, this is all we can do, Nick.
Got to do it now!

01:34:04.291 --> 01:34:05.375
There they go.

01:34:14.583 --> 01:34:15.583
Gotcha.

01:34:22.041 --> 01:34:23.125
What?

01:34:24.708 --> 01:34:26.166
Yeah.

01:34:26.166 --> 01:34:27.541
I got 'em.

01:34:29.625 --> 01:34:31.541
- Carol, down here!
Chris?

01:34:33.208 --> 01:34:35.166
Carol!

01:34:35.166 --> 01:34:36.416
Whoa!

01:34:38.875 --> 01:34:40.750
Hey!

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
Whoa, this chicken is trippin'!

01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:47.583
Beautiful and fast, coming through!

01:34:47.583 --> 01:34:50.208
I'm the cabbie!
I should be the one driving!

01:34:51.291 --> 01:34:53.250
Now I know what Barbie feels like!

01:34:53.250 --> 01:34:54.791
Let's punch it!

01:34:54.791 --> 01:34:57.083
You're not even using the turn signal!

01:34:57.083 --> 01:34:59.000
Look, it's Chris!

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.625
Hey! Cordelia!

01:35:00.625 --> 01:35:02.208
Oh, gee, we're too late.

01:35:02.208 --> 01:35:04.125
- Get in! Get in!
- Chris, jump in!

01:35:04.125 --> 01:35:05.416
Hey!

01:35:05.416 --> 01:35:07.250
Oh, my God, I'm never
going to Popeyes again!

01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:08.666
Get in, guv!

01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:12.000
- Oh, you got to be yolkin' kidding me!

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.750
Punch it!
Let's go!

01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:15.666
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:35:15.666 --> 01:35:18.375
What happened to me? It's not 8:00 yet.

01:35:18.375 --> 01:35:19.833
Pepper moved the hands on the clock.

01:35:19.833 --> 01:35:23.375
I told you, she always cheats to win!

01:35:23.375 --> 01:35:26.208
But I still have time.
We got to get the rest of those rings.

01:35:26.208 --> 01:35:28.750
Ay, we all just gonna sit here
and act like his ass ain't already glass?

01:35:28.750 --> 01:35:29.875
We just gonna do that?

01:35:36.708 --> 01:35:38.041
There's one.

01:35:38.041 --> 01:35:40.875
Hard to port! Put your weight on it!

01:35:40.875 --> 01:35:42.875
- Catch it, bro!
- Oy! Huzzah!

01:35:42.875 --> 01:35:45.000
That's what I'm talking about.
Nice one, Pip!

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.833
That ain't nothing. Watch this.

01:35:46.833 --> 01:35:48.875
Call this a Tootsie Roll.

01:35:48.875 --> 01:35:51.333
A-one, a-two, a-three.

01:35:51.333 --> 01:35:53.500
I got all the rings
from Cordelia's three marriages.

01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:55.458
Those were annulled and you know it!

01:35:57.125 --> 01:35:59.375
Oh, bombs away! Look out!

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.541
Got it! I got it! I got it!

01:36:08.125 --> 01:36:09.458
We can't get traction, y'all!

01:36:09.458 --> 01:36:11.041
- We got to go!

01:36:17.958 --> 01:36:19.375
Come on, come on,

01:36:19.375 --> 01:36:21.083
come on!

01:36:21.083 --> 01:36:22.875
Uh, that's not our only problem.

01:36:22.875 --> 01:36:24.000
Give me that thing.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.666
Hey, don't just touch another man's stick.

01:36:27.208 --> 01:36:29.208
- I got this.
- Oh, I think I got it.

01:36:29.208 --> 01:36:31.166
- Here we go!

01:36:31.166 --> 01:36:32.375
Whoa!

01:36:32.375 --> 01:36:34.166
Stick that chicken!

01:36:34.166 --> 01:36:35.541
- Okay.

01:36:35.541 --> 01:36:37.916
This better work!

01:36:37.916 --> 01:36:39.291
Come on, Chris!

01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:42.083
Okay, impressive.

01:36:42.083 --> 01:36:43.416
Yes!

01:36:43.416 --> 01:36:45.625
Got the ring! Let's go!

01:36:45.625 --> 01:36:48.791
Yes! Everything is going great!

01:36:50.916 --> 01:36:52.750
End of the road, sugarplums.

01:36:52.750 --> 01:36:55.458
God! Why are you always finding us?

01:36:55.458 --> 01:36:57.916
Oh, look at the oppressor
with the foot on our necks.

01:36:57.916 --> 01:36:59.541
You signed a contract.

01:36:59.541 --> 01:37:00.916
That's not fair.

01:37:00.916 --> 01:37:02.375
Oh, it's just business.

01:37:02.375 --> 01:37:03.708
Dad, no!

01:37:03.708 --> 01:37:04.833
You're a villain.

01:37:04.833 --> 01:37:06.250
- Hey.
- Ow.

01:37:06.250 --> 01:37:08.375
Oh, my God.

01:37:08.375 --> 01:37:09.750
Easy now, guv.

01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:12.041
Hold on. One minute.

01:37:13.041 --> 01:37:15.250
Chris? Oh, my God.

01:37:15.250 --> 01:37:16.958
- Oh, blimey.

01:37:16.958 --> 01:37:19.250
I had no idea
that this would actually happen.

01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:22.416
I know, honey.
It's like we're in the Twilight Zone.

01:37:22.416 --> 01:37:23.875
Dad, no.

01:37:23.875 --> 01:37:25.000
How do we fix this?

01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:26.500
Daddy!

01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:28.125
I'm-a keep it real.

01:37:28.125 --> 01:37:29.833
Worst Christmas ever.

01:37:30.916 --> 01:37:33.666
Look, bad things happen to good people,

01:37:33.666 --> 01:37:37.083
but if you have family and love,

01:37:37.083 --> 01:37:39.000
you'll get through anything.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.000
And it's always better to get through it
together than on your own.

01:37:45.875 --> 01:37:49.333
Joy, you go to any college you want to.

01:37:49.333 --> 01:37:51.750
'Cause you are unstoppable,

01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:54.041
and it should be your choice.

01:37:54.041 --> 01:37:57.708
And, Nick, your music is good.

01:37:57.708 --> 01:37:59.041
Really good.

01:37:59.041 --> 01:38:00.666
I saw that tonight.

01:38:00.666 --> 01:38:04.916
Son, you're an entertainer
and you're a leader,

01:38:04.916 --> 01:38:07.083
and you need to share your gift.

01:38:07.083 --> 01:38:09.958
And, Holly, baby girl,

01:38:09.958 --> 01:38:12.666
you keep the spirit of Christmas alive,
every day.

01:38:12.666 --> 01:38:15.291
That's always been your gift to the world.

01:38:15.291 --> 01:38:18.541
That's always been your gift to me.

01:38:18.541 --> 01:38:21.916
And, Carol, mama,
you gonna have to go on without me.

01:38:21.916 --> 01:38:24.666
No, Chris.
Chris, we're not the Carvers without you.

01:38:24.666 --> 01:38:25.833
We're just not.

01:38:25.833 --> 01:38:28.541
Oh, too bad, so sad.

01:38:28.541 --> 01:38:30.625
Say goodbye to your dad.

01:38:30.625 --> 01:38:32.500
Wait, wait. Wait!

01:38:34.666 --> 01:38:36.833
Santa! Please.

01:38:36.833 --> 01:38:38.250
Please, you've got to help.

01:38:39.333 --> 01:38:41.208
No, no, no. Don't get any ideas, old man.

01:38:41.208 --> 01:38:42.541
I won fair and square.

01:38:42.541 --> 01:38:45.041
They needed 40 gold rings in their hands.

01:38:45.041 --> 01:38:47.041
And how many rings do they have?

01:38:48.583 --> 01:38:51.166
- 38. I counted.
- Uh, 38.

01:38:51.166 --> 01:38:52.750
We have 38 gold rings.

01:38:52.750 --> 01:38:54.458
You sure about that?

01:38:54.458 --> 01:38:56.666
Y-Yeah. I-I...

01:38:58.333 --> 01:39:01.000
Wait. 39. 39!

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.125
Plus mine makes 40!

01:39:10.708 --> 01:39:12.708
Dad, you're back!
- What just happened?

01:39:14.833 --> 01:39:16.083
Oh, God, you're heavy.

01:39:17.500 --> 01:39:19.625
Hi.

01:39:19.625 --> 01:39:21.833
Oh, my God! I love you!

01:39:21.833 --> 01:39:23.333
Oh, I love y'all so much.

01:39:23.333 --> 01:39:24.750
We love you, too.
- Oh, God.

01:39:25.833 --> 01:39:27.375
- Oh, my goodness.
-  Holly.

01:39:27.375 --> 01:39:28.750
Daddy, I love you.

01:39:30.875 --> 01:39:32.458
Those don't count. Those don't count!

01:39:32.458 --> 01:39:34.208
40 rings, Pepper.

01:39:34.208 --> 01:39:36.125
- No! No.
- Just like you said.

01:39:36.125 --> 01:39:38.250
In their hands.

01:39:38.250 --> 01:39:39.833
No, no, no, no!

01:39:39.833 --> 01:39:41.833
No!

01:39:41.833 --> 01:39:43.500
No, no!

01:39:44.708 --> 01:39:47.041
No. No.

01:39:48.666 --> 01:39:50.125
No!

01:39:50.125 --> 01:39:52.708
Hey, can y'all not forget about
the little people, like, literally?

01:39:52.708 --> 01:39:55.166
Hey, Santa,

01:39:55.166 --> 01:39:57.208
is there anything you can do to help them?

01:39:57.208 --> 01:39:59.333
No. No, they are mine.

01:40:00.708 --> 01:40:02.333
They made a deal, too, and they lost!

01:40:02.333 --> 01:40:04.708
- They lost!
- You're right. They did.

01:40:04.708 --> 01:40:05.875
- Oh.
- There's nothing I can do.

01:40:05.875 --> 01:40:07.250
Shaken ornament syndrome.

01:40:07.250 --> 01:40:09.625
But I know something that can.

01:40:09.625 --> 01:40:10.750
Oh, what's that?

01:40:10.750 --> 01:40:12.666
A child's Christmas wish.

01:40:12.666 --> 01:40:14.208
Aw.

01:40:16.333 --> 01:40:18.375
Oprah said if I believe,
I can do anything!

01:40:19.916 --> 01:40:21.875
Let's park and dive!

01:40:21.875 --> 01:40:23.833
PIP
Jumping in!

01:40:23.833 --> 01:40:26.625
- Oh! Oh!

01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:36.041
We're back! We're back!

01:40:37.041 --> 01:40:39.333
What in the absolute f--

01:40:39.333 --> 01:40:42.041
- ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la. ♪

01:40:42.041 --> 01:40:43.500
Holly, my angel.

01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:45.500
- Are you Gary?
- Yeah. And you my future, ain't you?

01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:46.875
- No, no, no, I didn't mean it like that.
- Are you my future?

01:40:46.875 --> 01:40:48.125
Come on, baby, you don't like all that?

01:40:48.125 --> 01:40:50.000
- I don't.
- Okay.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.375
All right, all right.

01:40:54.916 --> 01:40:56.375
What are we doing?!

01:40:56.375 --> 01:40:58.666
- What are we doing?!

01:40:58.666 --> 01:41:01.583
Hey! Way to go, Santa Claus!

01:41:01.583 --> 01:41:03.000
Why is this happening to me?

01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:06.750
It's what I asked Santa for.

01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:08.000
For Christmas.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.125
Are you elfin' kidding me?

01:41:10.125 --> 01:41:12.291
Thugs need hugs.

01:41:12.291 --> 01:41:14.041
- Oh, no, no, no. -No, don't, don't, don't!

01:41:14.041 --> 01:41:16.125
Don't! Oh. Oh.

01:41:17.375 --> 01:41:19.333
Why is it so warm?

01:41:19.333 --> 01:41:21.291
That's the spirit.

01:41:21.291 --> 01:41:23.625
Now, if you promise to be good,

01:41:23.625 --> 01:41:26.500
I'll let you return to the North Pole.

01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:27.708
Deal!

01:41:27.708 --> 01:41:29.125
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:41:29.125 --> 01:41:31.750
You gonna let her return to the North Pole
after all the stuff she did to us?

01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:34.041
I'm Santa Claus, Christopher.

01:41:34.041 --> 01:41:35.833
Everybody gets a second chance.

01:41:35.833 --> 01:41:37.291
Oh, no, Santa Claus.

01:41:37.291 --> 01:41:39.000
I mean, she did a lot of stuff here.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.708
At-at the very least,
she should be flogged or something.

01:41:41.708 --> 01:41:43.041
- Mm-hmm.
Oh.

01:41:43.041 --> 01:41:45.041
It's been a long time
since my last flogging.

01:41:45.041 --> 01:41:47.750
- Well, you overdue.

01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:49.666
All right, come on, everyone.

01:41:49.666 --> 01:41:52.250
Let's get you home in time for Christmas.

01:41:52.250 --> 01:41:53.708
- Oh, oh! Bye!
Bye!

01:41:53.708 --> 01:41:55.458
- Shotgun!
-  Not if I get there first!

01:41:55.458 --> 01:41:57.625
- That's not how shotgun works, Gary!

01:41:57.625 --> 01:42:00.541
My heels! Oops.

01:42:00.541 --> 01:42:02.791
Where's your magic up in here?

01:42:05.708 --> 01:42:07.083
I'm gonna miss you, guv.

01:42:07.083 --> 01:42:10.291
Pip, I wish you could stay, but you
probably got family waiting on you, right?

01:42:12.291 --> 01:42:14.000
Right.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.916
Family.

01:42:15.916 --> 01:42:17.875
That's the real gift, innit?

01:42:17.875 --> 01:42:19.916
Yeah, it is.

01:42:19.916 --> 01:42:21.333
Merry Christmas, Pip.

01:42:21.333 --> 01:42:23.250
Merry Christmas.

01:42:23.250 --> 01:42:24.708
All right.

01:42:26.208 --> 01:42:27.958
Babe, look. They're gonna take off.

01:42:27.958 --> 01:42:30.208
Merry Christmas, everyone!

01:42:30.208 --> 01:42:31.916

I mean, I think it... I think it was real.

01:43:30.666 --> 01:43:33.375

I don't know how we gonna top this
next year.

01:43:47.083 --> 01:43:49.541
- No, Chris, we don't want to do that.
- What? Next year? -Seriously? -What?

01:43:49.541 --> 01:43:52.125
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
- Okay, but the-the good news!

01:43:52.125 --> 01:43:54.125
It's ten months to Halloween.

01:43:54.125 --> 01:43:55.875

Merry Christmas, Bruce.

01:44:12.958 --> 01:44:14.833
- Chris. Thank you.
- Yeah, man.

01:44:14.833 --> 01:44:17.458
I didn't get anything for you, but I will.

01:44:17.458 --> 01:44:18.541
And hey!

01:44:18.541 --> 01:44:20.333
What is this?

01:44:20.333 --> 01:44:22.083
- It's fleece. It's fleece.
- Is this... Is it real fleece?

01:44:22.083 --> 01:44:23.958
- That's real fleece. Yeah.
- That is so generous of you.

01:44:23.958 --> 01:44:26.666
I love fleece.

01:44:26.666 --> 01:44:28.083
How about that?

01:44:28.083 --> 01:44:30.458
- I saw it, and I thought, "Bruce."

01:44:30.458 --> 01:44:33.250
Little known fact about fleece:
It's very breathable.

01:44:33.250 --> 01:44:35.500
- Very breathable fabric.

01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:38.250
- That's not the calling birds, is it?
- I really hope not.

01:44:39.333 --> 01:44:40.500
Hello?

01:44:43.166 --> 01:44:44.250

01:45:30.875 --> 01:45:32.458
- No, I'm okay. Okay.
- Okay.

01:45:34.333 --> 01:45:35.458

I made a wish meself, Holly.

01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:49.750
It's to not spend the holidays on me own.

01:45:49.750 --> 01:45:51.541
- Aw. -If you'll have me.
- Oh, man.

01:45:51.541 --> 01:45:52.791
Get this man a taco.

01:45:52.791 --> 01:45:54.708
- Tacos.
- Taco?

01:45:54.708 --> 01:45:57.916
- What is that?
- This is wine in a box!

01:45:57.916 --> 01:45:59.416
- How kind.
- Aw.

01:45:59.416 --> 01:46:00.750
And what is this?

01:46:00.750 --> 01:46:02.625
That is a fresh lady mallard.

01:46:02.625 --> 01:46:05.250

01:46:06.375 --> 01:46:08.916

01:46:08.916 --> 01:46:10.708
Ah, well, come on in and have a seat.

01:46:12.166 --> 01:46:13.833
We're having tacos tonight.

01:46:13.833 --> 01:46:15.791
- Please. -Oh, splendid.
- But, uh, I'm sure

01:46:15.791 --> 01:46:20.000
we could, uh, figure out how to, how to
break this, uh, lady mallard down into--

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:21.250
Baby, do you, do you know
how to prepare mallard?

01:46:21.250 --> 01:46:22.958
Ooh, nice one.

01:46:22.958 --> 01:46:24.541
Chris, fits like a glove.

01:46:24.541 --> 01:46:26.583
Ah, yes, it does. That's a sport cut.

01:46:26.583 --> 01:46:28.208
Yeah, it's very hard to breathe, though.
