We won't tell anybody.

Well...kinda famous.

Okay, it's the Hunter Feldstein

00:36.637 --> 00:39.773
and yes, he is president
of the student council,

a big deal.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.944
Plus, his dad owns
a car dealership,

loved that as a kid.

to a couple of houses

is never really gonna happen.

you let me know,

in what their kids are reading.

that kind of parenting
