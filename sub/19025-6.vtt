<i>It's nice when Carla's family comes to</i>
<i>town, because she cleans our apartment.</i>

00:07.000 --> 00:08.991
A pancake in the silverware drawer?

00:09.080 --> 00:12.390
Why is there silverware
in the pancake drawer?

00:13.720 --> 00:17.030
Those nuts are for my brother.
Please don't eat them all.

00:17.120 --> 00:20.078
Why you making a big deal
about your brother coming?

00:20.160 --> 00:24.676
My baby brother, I practically raised
him. Get along with him this time.

00:24.760 --> 00:27.228
If you do,
I promise to fulfil your fantasy.

00:27.320 --> 00:29.629
But not with the weird outfit
or those toys.

00:29.720 --> 00:31.836
- So normal sex?
- If I'm not sleeping.

00:31.920 --> 00:32.955
Deal.

00:33.040 --> 00:36.669
What's up? Something happen
at her mother's funeral?

00:39.480 --> 00:43.519
This is a rental and I got the mileage
up here. No joy-riding, <i>comprende?</i>

00:44.720 --> 00:47.757
Turk. This is my brother, Marco.

00:49.360 --> 00:51.555
Sorry for your loss.

00:51.800 --> 00:54.678
I mean, who wears a vest
to a funeral anyway?

00:54.760 --> 00:59.788
<i>The amazing thing wasn't</i>
<i>that Carla's brother hated Turk.</i>

01:01.680 --> 01:05.673
<i>It's that he could keep it up</i>
<i>without speaking the same language.</i>

01:15.200 --> 01:17.873
Dude, you were wearing a vest.
<i>Vesto.</i>

01:20.120 --> 01:22.918
<i>I had my own problems.</i>
<i>Elliot had a boyfriend,</i>

01:23.000 --> 01:27.312
<i>but I was still crazy about her</i>
<i>and she wasn't making it any easier.</i>

01:28.560 --> 01:31.677
- What are you doing?
- All the beds are taken. Scoot.

01:31.760 --> 01:33.159
Bunk with the Todd.

01:33.240 --> 01:35.595
JD, you know that
he is a sleep-humper.

01:35.680 --> 01:39.798
Sometimes when I'm banging this
mattress, I'm thinking about that one.

01:44.360 --> 01:47.875
Hello?
Sean? Where are you?

01:48.760 --> 01:52.036
The west coast of New Zealand?
I'm in the on-call room.

01:52.120 --> 01:54.714
- JD's here. Say "hi".
- Hey, Sean.

01:56.280 --> 01:58.396
Oh, you wanted to keep talking?

01:59.120 --> 02:03.159
<i>How can you get over someone</i>
<i>when you're around them all the time?</i>

02:44.040 --> 02:47.430
<i>This night could not get any worse.</i>

02:48.760 --> 02:50.193
Todd.

02:50.280 --> 02:52.271
You're having a dream. Wake up.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.396
Dude. I am awake.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.556
I'm worried about our giant nanny.

03:05.640 --> 03:09.030
When the fridge is empty, she looks
at our son like a plate of ribs.

03:09.120 --> 03:11.031
Should have hired the skinny model.

03:11.120 --> 03:13.475
If she ate Jack,
she'd throw up right after.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.393
I got board meetings all day.
See you for dinner.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.556
- Doug!
- I don't wanna be a doctor!

03:25.360 --> 03:28.238
Fine. I'll tell you how it ends.

03:28.320 --> 03:33.838
Dr Phil says, "And how
is that working out for you?"

03:33.920 --> 03:36.753
Then the big fat lady cries.
All right.

03:36.840 --> 03:40.469
I'm sure you're wondering
why I'm residency director

03:40.560 --> 03:44.678
considering my disdain
for... well... all of you.

03:44.760 --> 03:47.115
Is it the extra $4 a week
in my paycheque,

03:47.200 --> 03:52.832
or is it that I have a chance to make a
difference in this godforsaken hellhole.

03:52.920 --> 03:55.115
It's all about the $4, trust me.

03:55.200 --> 03:59.955
And seeing as my money is contingent
on you lemmings doing your jobs,

04:00.040 --> 04:03.350
I'd say now is a pre <i>tty</i> good time
for you to scurry on back to work

04:03.440 --> 04:07.592
so that I can afford the
anti-depressants that keep me so jolly.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.469
Go!

04:11.760 --> 04:12.875
Say, Angela.

04:13.960 --> 04:17.793
I think he means me, Angela.
<i>I wonder what I did now.</i>

04:17.880 --> 04:22.510
This new gig is a great opportunity
for me and I want it to go well.

04:22.600 --> 04:25.398
For some reason,
these bobble-heads look up to you,

04:25.480 --> 04:29.712
so it would make my life one hell of a
lot easier if you got in line behind me.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.119
No problem.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.589
<i>I guess people can surprise you.</i>

04:37.680 --> 04:39.910
- We'd still die.
- We'd still what?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.356
If the elevator cable snapped,
even if we jumped before impact,

04:43.440 --> 04:44.873
we'd be crushed to death.

04:44.960 --> 04:47.155
- I wish I'd taken the stairs.
- Me too.

04:47.240 --> 04:50.232
Sorry, sometimes I have this
inner monologue in my head.

04:50.320 --> 04:53.312
<i>Inner monologue? Weirdo!</i>

04:54.480 --> 04:56.914
This is my floor.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.831
Lucky bastard.

05:21.560 --> 05:24.074
- What did I miss?
- It's come to my attention...

05:24.160 --> 05:25.673
It came to his attention.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.672
...family of critically ill
patients complained

05:28.760 --> 05:32.514
because of the small amount of time
you spend with their loved ones.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.830
In Dr Murphy's case,
that's a good thing.

05:34.920 --> 05:40.199
Sir, if I could take this chance
to explain my high mortality rate...?

05:40.280 --> 05:42.396
I'll do that.
You're a bad doctor.

05:42.480 --> 05:46.029
Complaints are a stone's throw
away from lawsuits.

05:46.120 --> 05:50.352
So from this point on, I don't care
how bleak a patient's prognosis is,

05:50.440 --> 05:54.115
you'll give each and every one
the same amount of your time.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.436
<i>Unfortunately, our residency director</i>
<i>felt differently.</i>

05:59.520 --> 06:01.750
Dead. Dead.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.752
Dead, dead, and... Oh, my goodness,

06:04.840 --> 06:07.718
if we don't have somebody here
we might be able to help.

06:07.800 --> 06:11.679
Miss Barto is 3 <i>6</i>, septic
and in respiratory failure.

06:11.760 --> 06:15.389
Dr Weiss, draw up three sets
of surveillance cultures.

06:15.480 --> 06:17.755
- Mr Murphy...
- Dr Murphy?

06:20.440 --> 06:22.590
Just go ahead and get a stat ABG.

06:22.680 --> 06:25.558
We're going to try
to wean her off of the vent today,

06:25.640 --> 06:28.552
so I want all of you to
give her most of your attention.

06:28.640 --> 06:32.679
I say we listen to Dr Cox
and do exactly what he says.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.319
That's unbelievable.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.960
But earlier,
Dr Kelso was telling us that...

06:38.880 --> 06:41.838
I don't want to hear anything
out of that man's mouth,

06:41.920 --> 06:44.150
unless it's:
"My God. I'm dying."

06:44.240 --> 06:47.596
"I'm moving towards the light.
Wait, there's been a mistake."

06:47.680 --> 06:50.399
"This is hell.
Hello, Hitler. Hello, Mussolini."

06:50.480 --> 06:53.199
"Captain Kangaroo. That's weird."

06:53.280 --> 06:58.752
Barbie, I would rather listen to you go
on and on about the joys of dolphin sex.

06:58.840 --> 07:01.752
Dolphin trainer sex.
My boyfriend is a trainer.

07:01.840 --> 07:05.799
That's a shame. The whole dolphin thing
used to make you so interesting.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.438
Too bad. We are moving on.

07:07.520 --> 07:11.479
- You heard, people, we're moving on.
- God help me.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.471
God help him.

07:14.960 --> 07:18.509
<i>My God, is there</i>
<i>a sexier woman in the world?</i>

07:18.600 --> 07:21.239
I gotta go. My chin hair is back.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.754
<i>I wish she'd cut it off</i>
<i>and give it to me.</i>

07:23.840 --> 07:24.955
Oh, God.

07:25.040 --> 07:29.318
I don't mind sitting alone at movies.
But eating alone is sad and pathetic.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.072
- Are you stalking me?
- No.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.720
My sister had a baby.
I'm doing the aunt thing.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.792
Plus it's an excuse
to run away from a relationship.

07:36.880 --> 07:40.077
My boyfriend just dumped me,
so now I love him more than ever.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.310
Any chance of you getting back together?

07:42.400 --> 07:45.631
He's engaged to be married in two weeks.
But yeah, I think so.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.392
- Unrequited love sucks, you know?
- Yeah, it does.

07:49.480 --> 07:50.993
Know what we need to do...?

07:51.080 --> 07:52.672
- Danni.
- JD. Hi.

07:52.760 --> 07:56.355
We need to move on, OK?
No waiting for our exes by the phone,

07:56.440 --> 07:58.271
no stealing her purse
to return it

07:58.360 --> 08:02.990
and hope she's so grateful, she'll buy
you a drink and maybe have sex after.

08:03.080 --> 08:06.117
- Did that work?
- I stole the wrong purse.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.077
And yes.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.755
Why don't you play the
game with Marco?

08:17.840 --> 08:19.512
I hate Pac-Man.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.876
Really? You have bed sheets
that indicate otherwise.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.188
Fine. Ask him.

08:43.600 --> 08:48.116
Did somebody say cheese? If you're gonna
make a cheese-run, holla at me.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.873
Baby, when we left
the Dominican Republic,

08:50.960 --> 08:54.794
Marco never wanted to learn English.
He went to school in Puerto Rico.

08:54.880 --> 08:57.678
Imagine what it's like
to feel like an outsider

08:57.760 --> 09:00.035
because you're proud
of your heritage.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.315
Did you say something about cheese?

09:05.560 --> 09:08.791
Miss Barto's systemic
vascular resistance is falling,

09:08.880 --> 09:11.553
so the next couple of hours
are going to be crucial.

09:11.640 --> 09:15.792
The fact that these residents are
spending their time with that patient

09:15.880 --> 09:19.111
makes me think you told them
to disobey a direct order from me.

09:19.200 --> 09:25.230
Bob Kelso, that's not true. I told them
to disregard all direct orders from you.

09:25.320 --> 09:29.359
I know you all think of me
as some heartless monster.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.510
Still, if you grandmother were here,

09:31.600 --> 09:35.195
wouldn't you want her doctor to spend
as much time with her as anyone?

09:35.280 --> 09:39.478
Grandma Dorian or Nana Hobbs? Nana
Hobbs can be an eensy bit racist.

09:39.560 --> 09:41.198
- Grandma Dorian.
- She's dead.

09:41.280 --> 09:46.877
Sometimes what's best for this hospital
is what's best for the patients.

09:46.960 --> 09:49.997
I know it, you know it
and Dr Cox knows it too.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.913
Though he disagrees with me
just because I said it.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.070
Sir, I don't think that's true.

09:55.160 --> 09:57.549
- It's hotter than hell in here.
- Freezing.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.392
- Great coffee.
- Rat piss.

09:59.480 --> 10:01.675
Dr Murphy is an incompetent suck-up.

10:01.760 --> 10:05.150
He's one of the finest young doctors
I've ever worked with.

10:05.240 --> 10:06.639
Your witness.

10:09.960 --> 10:12.349
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling my dad.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.953
- Hey, how are you?
- Good.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.395
- So I did it. I talked to my ex.
- And?

10:22.480 --> 10:26.678
I said, "Congratulations, I hope you two
stay happy, and size does matter."

10:26.760 --> 10:29.479
See? That's what happens
when you cut the cord.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.949
You'll be ready for
someone new to come along.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.837
You wanna grab a cup of coffee?

10:33.920 --> 10:36.912
I can't, I got something
really important to do.

10:39.320 --> 10:44.394
Thanks, JD, I'm so tense.
Someone stole my purse.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.357
It'll turn up.

10:46.440 --> 10:50.513
<i>Once the dynamic of a relationship</i>
<i>is established, it rarely changes.</i>

10:57.040 --> 11:01.955
I'm sorry,
but I can't understand you.

11:02.040 --> 11:05.953
Yeah? That talking slower and louder
thing is not as helpful as you think.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.349
Jeez, can you believe this guy?

11:13.600 --> 11:17.559
<i>If the dynamic does change,</i>
<i>it's never as simple as you'd hope.</i>

11:17.640 --> 11:18.868
Hey, Newbie.

11:18.960 --> 11:22.032
I got dinner plans with Jordan
and seeing as you're on call,

11:22.120 --> 11:24.998
why not pull up a chair
in front of Miss Barto?

11:25.080 --> 11:28.595
<i>Especially with somebody</i>
<i>who's used to you following their lead.</i>

11:28.680 --> 11:31.353
I'll take care of her
and I'll have my interns help,

11:31.440 --> 11:33.829
but you know,
I have other patients too, so...

11:33.920 --> 11:36.992
Maybe you didn't understand me,
there, Violet.

11:37.080 --> 11:41.358
I don't want you leaving her side
even if someone sees Justin Timberlake.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.829
Damn it, are you
falling in line with me or not?

11:44.800 --> 11:46.074
I don't think so.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.598
OK, then.

11:59.600 --> 12:02.398
<i>It was strange not doing</i>
<i>what Dr Cox wanted me to do.</i>

12:02.480 --> 12:04.232
<i>Still, I knew I was right.</i>

12:04.320 --> 12:07.596
<i>God. If Jordan knew I was</i>
<i>the reason Dr Cox cancelled dinner,</i>

12:07.680 --> 12:09.989
<i>she'd twist my nipples off.</i>

12:10.080 --> 12:13.072
<i>Calm down, Tiger. She doesn't know.</i>

12:14.640 --> 12:16.198
<i>She knows!</i>

12:18.760 --> 12:21.957
Don't worry, guys.
I'd never let her hurt you.

12:26.240 --> 12:28.515
Baby, there you are.
He speaks English.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.272
- Who?
- Your brother.

12:30.360 --> 12:31.873
Tell her you speak English.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.474
Don't... <i>Qué</i> my ass.
<i>Qué</i> my ass.

12:36.520 --> 12:39.080
You saw the whole thing. Tell her.

12:39.160 --> 12:41.276
I don't know what you're talking about.

12:41.360 --> 12:44.477
Turk, I would know
if my own brother speaks English.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.433
JD.

12:52.520 --> 12:55.876
Those pictures of us when we were
going out, do you have those?

12:55.960 --> 12:57.951
<i>Filed in my Elliot cabinet.</i>

12:58.040 --> 13:00.190
I don't know, I might. Why?

13:00.280 --> 13:03.670
The one at the beach where I look good
and you look like Björk?

13:03.760 --> 13:05.910
- Yeah.
- I was hoping you wouldn't mind

13:06.000 --> 13:09.151
if I cut you out and used it in
a collage I'm making for Sean.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.719
- No problem.
- Thanks.

13:18.360 --> 13:21.750
- How's the moving on thing going?
- It's going great, Danni.

13:21.840 --> 13:23.592
In opposite world.

13:23.680 --> 13:27.150
I wanted to say goodbye. I was
gonna stick around a few more days,

13:27.240 --> 13:30.073
but I don't really feel
like there's a reason to.

13:30.160 --> 13:32.720
- Is there?
- Probably not.

13:34.800 --> 13:38.759
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you too.

13:38.840 --> 13:41.229
Dude, we just met. I was kidding.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.471
That's good.
No, I was doing the same thing.

13:46.440 --> 13:48.476
Drive safe.

13:50.360 --> 13:51.679
Hey, Barbie.

13:51.760 --> 13:55.719
How about you sashay over here,
push those bangs out of your face,

13:55.800 --> 13:58.758
and keep those peepers
on Miss Barto's haemodynamics?

13:58.840 --> 14:02.594
First, I've got to discharge Mr Hale,
get a stat CT on Mrs Peterson,

14:02.680 --> 14:05.148
then perform a thong extrication
on Ms Reid.

14:05.240 --> 14:07.834
Hey, your last name is Reid.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.354
Doug, I have underwear in my butt.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.908
After that,
I'll totally swing back by here.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.959
You're losing them. Don't get me wrong.
You had me worried

14:20.040 --> 14:23.316
there was gonna be a bunch
of young Dr Coxes roaming the halls,

14:23.400 --> 14:27.473
calling me Bobbo, shaving my genitals
when I pass out at the Christmas party.

14:27.560 --> 14:30.552
- Tradition is tradition, Bob.
- Yeah.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.915
Then I remembered
you've been here 10 years

14:33.000 --> 14:36.993
and there's not a disciple of yours
to be found. You know why?

14:37.080 --> 14:39.594
You told them this story
and bored them to death?

14:41.920 --> 14:47.756
No. It's because eventually they start
questioning the gospel according to Cox

14:47.840 --> 14:52.072
and you can't handle that.
Can you?

14:58.640 --> 15:01.632
- Hey, jackass.
- Hello, Mark.

15:01.720 --> 15:05.156
- I'm guessing Carla's not around?
- She's in the bathroom.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.595
Hey, baby,
give me some of that minty breath.

15:09.680 --> 15:13.468
Not in front of my brother. That stuff
always makes him uncomfortable.

15:13.560 --> 15:19.078
Oh, really? I wanted to apologise
for the way I've been acting,

15:19.160 --> 15:22.072
by loving you up and down,
and all around.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.276
- Turk!
- He can't understand you.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.555
Let's put your footprints
on the ceiling.

15:26.640 --> 15:28.915
- That's it, you son of a bitch.
- I told you.

15:34.680 --> 15:38.639
So black people can get black eyes too.
Who knew?

15:38.720 --> 15:41.792
I haven't had one this bad since
Nana Hobbs threw that rock.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.950
She thought you were robbing the house.

15:44.040 --> 15:47.032
JD. Miss Barto's
completely stabilized.

15:47.120 --> 15:49.953
I don't want to see you
around here any more, OK?

15:50.800 --> 15:52.836
All right, you all got work to do.

15:52.920 --> 15:56.310
Newbie, maybe I wasn't clear enough
with you about Miss Barto?

15:56.400 --> 15:58.311
Here it comes. I'm incompetent,

15:58.400 --> 16:01.153
I'm a girl with pigtails
that rides a tricycle.

16:01.240 --> 16:05.153
No. Well, yes.
But I'm honestly trying to tell you

16:05.240 --> 16:08.710
I don't think I was being
clear with you before.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.598
In fact, I think
I was being a pre <i>tty</i> lousy teacher.

16:12.480 --> 16:15.836
Look, putting one in the win column
every now and then

16:15.920 --> 16:19.833
gives us the juice to keep pluggin'
along in games that we know, deep down,

16:19.920 --> 16:22.070
we're not gonna win.

16:22.160 --> 16:25.232
That's why I locked in
so intensely with that patient.

16:25.320 --> 16:30.235
Because opportunities, they...
They come along so rarely in this place.

16:30.320 --> 16:35.474
And when they do, you can't let them
slip through your fingers. You cannot.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.471
You know?

16:42.080 --> 16:44.071
I think I do.

16:45.040 --> 16:48.919
<i>I wasn't sure what I was hoping for.</i>
<i>That Danni had decided not to leave,</i>

16:49.000 --> 16:51.434
<i>that she'd snapped her leg</i>
<i>in the parking lot.</i>

16:51.520 --> 16:53.317
- Danni!
- Yo.

16:54.440 --> 16:57.159
All I knew was that
I had missed an opportunity.

17:31.240 --> 17:33.231
Sorry, sweetie.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.837
Sorry, sweetie.

17:36.920 --> 17:42.040
And Turk, you don't mind if now and
then, Marco and I speak Spanish?

17:42.120 --> 17:44.680
Baby, fo' shizzle dizzle.

17:45.840 --> 17:49.389
Do your thizzle,
cos I'm up out this pizzle.

17:49.480 --> 17:50.515
Church.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.239
See, we got our own secret language too.

18:03.520 --> 18:06.717
<i>No one knew her last name.</i>
<i>No one even remembered seeing her.</i>

18:06.800 --> 18:09.155
<i>I started to wonder</i>
<i>if Danni was even real.</i>

18:09.240 --> 18:11.595
<i>I guess that's</i>
<i>the thing about life. You...</i>

18:11.680 --> 18:13.830
- Hey, JD.
- Excuse me.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.514
<i>You don't really get</i>
<i>many second chances.</i>

18:16.600 --> 18:17.669
Danni, hi.

18:17.760 --> 18:20.797
Sorry, sometimes I have this
inner monologue in my head.

18:20.880 --> 18:23.314
Oh. <i>Weirdo.</i>

18:23.400 --> 18:26.676
I'm having dinner with my sister
but I'm leaving after that.

18:26.760 --> 18:29.718
Don't. Stay here with me,
we'll get that cup of coffee.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.916
I'm not gonna stick around for one.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.309
OK, two cups and some pie.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.358
<i>Finally, I found a girl</i>
<i>with no complications.</i>

18:37.440 --> 18:39.749
I see you've met my sister.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.197
<i>Oh, come on.</i>
