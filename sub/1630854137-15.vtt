00:04.221 --> 00:06.180
<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>

00:06.180 --> 00:07.485
<i>sexually based offenses</i>

00:07.485 --> 00:09.792
<i>are considered
especially heinous.</i>

00:09.792 --> 00:12.360
<i>In New York City,
the dedicated detectives</i>

00:12.360 --> 00:14.144
<i>who investigate
these vicious felonies</i>

00:14.144 --> 00:15.624
<i>are members of an elite squad</i>

00:15.624 --> 00:17.843
<i>known as
the Special Victims Unit.</i>

00:17.843 --> 00:21.021
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:21.021 --> 00:23.197
I'm sorry.
That's incorrect.

00:23.197 --> 00:25.851
Winnie?
- Perendinate.

00:25.851 --> 00:29.812
P-E-R-E-N-D-E-N-A-T-E.

00:29.812 --> 00:32.510
I'm sorry, Winnie.
That is incorrect.

00:32.510 --> 00:37.602
Pence, the word is perendinate.

00:38.951 --> 00:40.910
P--p--perendinate.

00:47.134 --> 00:49.005
P--p--perendinate.

00:49.005 --> 00:51.094
Can I have
a definition, please?

00:51.094 --> 00:53.531
To put off until
the day after tomorrow

00:53.531 --> 00:58.710
that which can be done today.

00:58.710 --> 01:03.889
P-E-R-E...

01:03.889 --> 01:08.894
N-D...

01:08.894 --> 01:12.550
I-N-A...

01:12.550 --> 01:15.597
T-E.

01:15.597 --> 01:17.251
P--perendinate.

01:17.251 --> 01:20.254
Very good,
and congratulations.

01:20.254 --> 01:24.823
You are the new
spelling bee champion.

01:37.009 --> 01:38.228
Excuse me.

01:38.228 --> 01:39.751
Why'd you let me win?

01:39.751 --> 01:41.231
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:41.231 --> 01:43.799
You knew how to
spell that word.

01:43.799 --> 01:46.541
I've never heard you speak
in front of everybody before.

01:46.541 --> 01:48.108
There's a reason for that.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.675
You hear them laugh.

01:50.675 --> 01:52.024
I wanted to help.

01:52.024 --> 01:54.375
I've read your story,

01:54.375 --> 01:57.117
the one on the wall,
"The King of the Moon."

01:57.117 --> 02:00.120
You read my story?

02:00.120 --> 02:02.470
About the boy who
lived on the moon

02:02.470 --> 02:04.733
so he didn't have
to talk to anyone.

02:04.733 --> 02:07.083
Trust me,
it's better that way.

02:07.083 --> 02:08.954
Is it?

02:25.884 --> 02:28.800
Winnie,

02:28.800 --> 02:31.020
we have too many books.

02:31.020 --> 02:33.805
Because of all
your little gifts.

02:33.805 --> 02:37.113
I suppose we could
thin the herd,

02:37.113 --> 02:39.289
including this.

02:39.289 --> 02:44.164
Pence, don't you dare.

02:44.164 --> 02:47.384
Read at your own risk.

02:47.384 --> 02:49.038
What about the desks?

02:49.038 --> 02:50.300
What about them?

02:50.300 --> 02:52.476
Do we really need two?

02:52.476 --> 02:54.652
You're the introvert.
You tell me.

02:54.652 --> 02:58.395
I prefer not to be
too far from you.

02:58.395 --> 03:04.793
Well, that is an
easily-surmountable problem.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.061
Oh, dear, look at the time.

03:12.061 --> 03:13.715
I'd rather not.

03:13.715 --> 03:16.021
Honey, you're gonna be late
for your ceremony.

03:16.021 --> 03:17.327
Ceremony?

03:17.327 --> 03:19.068
You are being awarded

03:19.068 --> 03:23.115
the Lewis Thomas Prize
by Rockefeller University.

03:23.115 --> 03:26.467
Yes, almost forgot.

03:26.467 --> 03:29.078
Forgot?

03:29.078 --> 03:30.514
You are a brilliant man,

03:30.514 --> 03:35.519
but you have no sense
of other people.

03:35.519 --> 03:38.043
I'll let you work
while I get dressed.

03:38.043 --> 03:40.045
Thank you.

04:16.517 --> 04:17.779
Where's Winnie?

04:17.779 --> 04:19.259
Playing tennis
with your neighbor.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.261
- Naomi.
- Ooh, that's very good.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.828
You remember her name.
Now, what's mine?

04:23.828 --> 04:26.222
Trash gets picked up tomorrow.

04:26.222 --> 04:29.269
Oh, that's a
terribly long name.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.792
That's it.
Good boy.

04:30.792 --> 04:33.360
Mm.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.839
One more.

04:34.839 --> 04:37.451
- Ah.
- Drinky-drink-drink.

04:37.451 --> 04:42.760
Madam, anyone who ever
loved you was wrong.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.464
Hello?

04:56.208 --> 05:00.125
Hello?

05:00.125 --> 05:02.476
Winnie?

05:02.476 --> 05:04.260
It's nothing.
Listen, go back to sleep.

05:04.260 --> 05:06.958
I heard something.

05:06.958 --> 05:09.918
Are you cheating on me?

05:09.918 --> 05:11.223
Is that it?

05:11.223 --> 05:13.443
Oh, sweetheart, no.

05:13.443 --> 05:15.358
With whom?

05:15.358 --> 05:18.013
Look at me.
Look, look, look.

05:18.013 --> 05:19.841
Look.

05:19.841 --> 05:25.586
You are and always shall be
my king of the moon.

05:32.593 --> 05:36.074
Go--go--go back to sleep,
my love.

05:44.082 --> 05:49.087
P-E-R-E-N-D...

05:51.307 --> 05:53.048
Her eyes.

05:53.048 --> 05:57.095
Hey, sir,
I asked you a question.

05:57.095 --> 05:59.968
What do you remember?

05:59.968 --> 06:02.710
I did it.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.842
I made love to her...

06:07.323 --> 06:10.500
And then I...

06:10.500 --> 06:12.937
I killed her.
I did it all.

07:06.861 --> 07:08.906
<i>I grew up just like you.</i>

07:08.906 --> 07:10.865
<i>Saw a lot of people
get murdered.</i>

07:10.865 --> 07:12.649
<i>And the second
my nuts dropped,</i>

07:12.649 --> 07:16.305
<i>my boss puts a gun in my hand
and has me blow this guy away.</i>

07:17.654 --> 07:19.351
What do you think?

07:19.351 --> 07:21.571
He's trying to flip Oscar
Papa's only living recruiter.

07:21.571 --> 07:24.487
We were desperate,
so lying's fair game.

07:24.487 --> 07:26.097
So a bit of theater?

07:26.097 --> 07:29.013
Well, that's what
I thought at first,

07:29.013 --> 07:31.668
but this double homicide

07:31.668 --> 07:34.410
that he mentions later
in this recording, Fin,

07:34.410 --> 07:35.759
is a real case.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.195
Unsolved?

07:37.195 --> 07:40.938
Two people,
execution style, 2003,

07:40.938 --> 07:42.940
right outside Fort Worth.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.594
All this says to me
is Velasco

07:44.594 --> 07:46.248
did research on his lie.

07:46.248 --> 07:48.380
That amount of homework
for some mid-level banger?

07:48.380 --> 07:50.034
You have another explanation?

07:50.034 --> 07:53.951
Fin, what exactly do
we know about Velasco?

07:56.040 --> 07:58.521
He drives a motorcycle.

07:58.521 --> 07:59.609
He grew up in Juarez.

07:59.609 --> 08:02.525
He alluded to some
misspent youth.

08:02.525 --> 08:04.962
Exactly how misspent?

08:04.962 --> 08:07.051
We could ask Muncy.
They're tight.

08:07.051 --> 08:08.836
Yeah, I already
had her listen to it,

08:08.836 --> 08:12.013
and I'm keeping her away from
this for that exact reason.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.928
Muncy is loyal to Velasco.

08:13.928 --> 08:17.061
I don't want secrets
in my squad.

08:21.631 --> 08:23.067
That who I think it is?

08:23.067 --> 08:24.939
- Yeah, it's Tonie Churlish.
- From the Bronx?

08:24.939 --> 08:27.071
Yeah, she volunteered
to help us

08:27.071 --> 08:28.420
drill down
on the Velasco story.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.597
You talked to McGrath
about this?

08:30.597 --> 08:32.424
No, I haven't.

08:32.424 --> 08:35.906
OK, I think it's time
I remind you,

08:35.906 --> 08:37.560
you're the captain.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.301
And the greatest gift
I can give you

08:39.301 --> 08:42.304
as your number two
is plausible deniability.

08:42.304 --> 08:43.653
So what do you suggest?

08:43.653 --> 08:45.916
You let me and the
White Shield take the lead

08:45.916 --> 08:47.396
and untangle this mess.

08:47.396 --> 08:48.745
And how the hell
are you going to do that?

08:48.745 --> 08:50.573
You leave that to me.

08:50.573 --> 08:54.055
- And if McGrath asks?
- We never talked about it.

08:56.927 --> 08:58.668
Carisi's waiting for me.

09:02.846 --> 09:05.196
Look who it is,
Captain America.

09:05.196 --> 09:08.548
Velasco, go take a seat
in interrogation.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.680
You, too, Churlish.

09:10.680 --> 09:11.899
Who are we interrogating?

09:11.899 --> 09:14.031
You.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.300
- Is everything OK?
- Well, trust me,

09:22.300 --> 09:24.520
if I answer that honestly,
you'd regret asking.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.566
So who's this?

09:26.566 --> 09:28.480
This big-time neurologist,
Pence Humphreys.

09:28.480 --> 09:31.309
Oh, the guy who writes
about rare brain disorders?

09:31.309 --> 09:32.615
Yeah, yeah, so you know him?

09:32.615 --> 09:34.486
I read one of his books
a while back

09:34.486 --> 09:36.880
about this conductor
who could only

09:36.880 --> 09:39.491
communicate through his piano
after he had a car crash.

09:39.491 --> 09:42.320
I mean, it's quirky,
but he's brilliant.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.106
Yeah, well, his latest book
is about dementia.

09:45.106 --> 09:46.629
It's a subject that he--

09:46.629 --> 09:48.500
he knows something about.

09:48.500 --> 09:51.286
<i>The prefrontal cortex manages</i>

09:51.286 --> 09:54.419
<i>all of our higher-level
executive functions.</i>

09:54.419 --> 10:00.338
<i>I'm afraid that...
mine is slowly dying.</i>

10:00.338 --> 10:02.776
<i>This has resulted in some
rather dramatic changes</i>

10:02.776 --> 10:05.300
<i>in my personality
over the last few years.</i>

10:05.300 --> 10:10.218
<i>I've become socially
disruptive, impulsive.</i>

10:10.218 --> 10:12.960
<i>In a few months' time, I may
no longer be able to speak,</i>

10:12.960 --> 10:15.397
<i>which is why
I need to record this today.</i>

10:15.397 --> 10:19.096
<i>I raped and smothered...</i>

10:22.012 --> 10:24.014
<i>My dear wife.</i>

10:24.014 --> 10:25.668
The guy confessed to it?

10:25.668 --> 10:28.671
Yeah, two days ago.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.978
There's something about this
that's bugging me.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.327
You don't think
that he did it?

10:32.327 --> 10:33.850
Something smells off.

10:33.850 --> 10:36.548
OK, is this you speaking
as an ADA or an ex-cop?

10:36.548 --> 10:38.550
Maybe it's me speaking
as a hopeless romantic.

10:38.550 --> 10:41.162
Now, there's no signs
of forced entry.

10:41.162 --> 10:42.642
No valuables were taken.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.383
Signs of sexual assault,
but there's no DNA.

10:45.383 --> 10:47.211
And Homicide's ready
to sign off?

10:47.211 --> 10:48.778
Yeah, his lawyer is probably
going to go with

10:48.778 --> 10:50.127
some kind of dementia defense.

10:50.127 --> 10:53.478
So where is the hopeless
romanticism in this?

10:57.613 --> 11:00.398
Him and his wife were
married for 40 years.

11:00.398 --> 11:03.010
It was this fairy-tale
love affair.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.838
He wrote about it
in one of his books,

11:04.838 --> 11:07.667
"The Neurobiology of Love."

11:07.667 --> 11:09.233
So now you're pulling
on the one

11:09.233 --> 11:11.235
good heartstring I have left?

11:11.235 --> 11:12.889
Liv, I know you're busy,

11:12.889 --> 11:16.458
but I could use another
set of eyes on this.

11:19.243 --> 11:22.246
Yeah, OK.

11:22.246 --> 11:24.509
I'll talk to him.

11:24.509 --> 11:26.555
<i>I grew up just like you.</i>

11:26.555 --> 11:29.123
<i>Saw a lot of people
get murdered.</i>

11:29.123 --> 11:30.428
<i>And the second
my nuts dropped,</i>

11:30.428 --> 11:33.388
<i>my boss puts a gun in my hand,</i>

11:33.388 --> 11:35.216
<i>and he made me
blow this guy away.</i>

11:35.216 --> 11:36.217
<i>And then what?</i>

11:36.217 --> 11:38.741
<i>I did it.</i>

11:38.741 --> 11:40.003
You recorded me?

11:40.003 --> 11:41.483
Relax, cowboy.

11:41.483 --> 11:43.267
No, we should place
this mallrat under arrest.

11:43.267 --> 11:44.660
For what?

11:44.660 --> 11:47.141
It's a felony to record
a third party in New York

11:47.141 --> 11:48.751
without permission.

11:48.751 --> 11:51.754
Well, lucky for both of you,
you're not in the courtroom.

11:51.754 --> 11:53.277
Then what the hell
is this about?

11:53.277 --> 11:56.672
Just trying to
establish credibility.

11:56.672 --> 11:59.283
So Benson heard everything
I said in this recording?

11:59.283 --> 12:00.850
And she wants to know
the truth.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.373
The truth?

12:02.373 --> 12:05.202
I was messing with the guy.
I made the whole thing up.

12:05.202 --> 12:08.945
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

12:08.945 --> 12:12.340
Are we done here?

12:12.340 --> 12:16.257
Recognize this?

12:16.257 --> 12:17.606
It's a dime bag.

12:17.606 --> 12:20.827
BX9 branding on the side.

12:23.307 --> 12:24.700
Where did you get this?

12:24.700 --> 12:26.006
I had a prison guard
snag it off

12:26.006 --> 12:29.009
that banger you gave it to.

12:29.009 --> 12:32.664
Sit down.

12:32.664 --> 12:36.494
Evidently, it tested positive
for heroin residue.

12:36.494 --> 12:37.974
Do you know anything
about that?

12:37.974 --> 12:39.976
Residue from the dope
I emptied before I filled

12:39.976 --> 12:41.108
the bag with powdered sugar.

12:41.108 --> 12:43.675
Yeah?

12:43.675 --> 12:46.896
What kind of sugar
can stop withdrawals?

12:49.333 --> 12:51.379
You've never heard
of a placebo effect?

12:52.989 --> 12:55.426
Placebo this.

12:55.426 --> 12:57.951
<i>20 minutes outside
of Fort Worth, 2003,</i>

12:57.951 --> 13:00.518
<i>me and my friend
blow this guy away.</i>

13:00.518 --> 13:02.999
We're about to leave,

13:02.999 --> 13:07.090
and the guy's son
comes out of the other room.

13:07.090 --> 13:09.179
Pow-pow.

13:09.179 --> 13:10.964
We didn't have a choice.

13:10.964 --> 13:14.837
You expect me to
believe that, you, a cop,

13:14.837 --> 13:16.491
did a gang hit?

13:16.491 --> 13:20.016
Trust me,
this was no gang hit.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.424
So much for credibility.

13:49.176 --> 13:50.438
Happy?

13:50.438 --> 13:53.093
If it comes back clean,
I will be.

13:56.226 --> 14:01.101
If you have any doubts, now
would be the time to say so.

14:01.101 --> 14:04.365
Mr. Humphreys, this is
Captain Olivia Benson.

14:04.365 --> 14:05.888
Nice to meet you.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.411
You look familiar.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.979
Well, I've actually
read some of your work.

14:09.979 --> 14:13.983
You wanted a half hour
to exculpate my client,

14:13.983 --> 14:15.506
so you have it.

14:15.506 --> 14:17.813
He's prepared to recant
his confession if we do?

14:17.813 --> 14:19.336
Well, he has dementia.

14:19.336 --> 14:22.731
So recant or not,
he's not likely to do time.

14:22.731 --> 14:24.733
What's with the chipmunk?

14:24.733 --> 14:26.953
That belonged to a friend.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.956
Belonged? My condolences.

14:29.956 --> 14:32.349
What would you like to know?

14:32.349 --> 14:35.613
Well, how about we start
with what happened?

14:35.613 --> 14:38.921
Isn't it obvious?
I smothered my wife.

14:38.921 --> 14:42.359
This was our plan.

14:42.359 --> 14:45.145
- Your plan?
- Self-checkout.

14:45.145 --> 14:47.103
We loved each other.
We wanted to be together.

14:47.103 --> 14:51.934
We wanted to leave together

14:51.934 --> 14:54.719
with dignity
at a time of our choosing.

14:54.719 --> 14:57.592
My crime is worse than murder.

14:57.592 --> 14:59.594
What Mr. Humphreys means

14:59.594 --> 15:02.162
is that he killed her
and then didn't follow through

15:02.162 --> 15:04.468
with taking his own life.
- Back pedaled.

15:04.468 --> 15:07.776
Abnegated. Reneged.

15:07.776 --> 15:11.693
And how were you planning
on killing yourself?

15:11.693 --> 15:15.349
An expeditious taste of
shotgun-flavored mouthwash,

15:15.349 --> 15:17.525
I'm afraid.

15:17.525 --> 15:20.354
Do you own a shotgun?

15:20.354 --> 15:24.314
If he does, homicide
detectives didn't find it.

15:24.314 --> 15:27.143
What's with the chipmunk?

15:31.017 --> 15:35.064
It belonged to a friend.

15:35.064 --> 15:37.197
Well, he is the
textbook definition

15:37.197 --> 15:38.894
of an unreliable witness.

15:38.894 --> 15:41.375
Well, he seems to believe
this murder-suicide story.

15:41.375 --> 15:42.854
Did you?

15:42.854 --> 15:44.117
For a minute, yeah.

15:44.117 --> 15:46.206
I mean, the guy is sharp
until he's not.

15:46.206 --> 15:48.599
Underneath his illness,
he is a man of science.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.427
So if we're going to try
to convince him

15:50.427 --> 15:52.560
of his own innocence,
then it wouldn't hurt

15:52.560 --> 15:54.475
to confront him
with some evidence.

15:54.475 --> 15:56.303
We'd better find something
before the arraignment.

15:56.303 --> 15:58.000
I can't imagine
these homicide cops

15:58.000 --> 16:00.437
spending that much time
gathering clues.

16:00.437 --> 16:02.178
Not when they have
a confession already.

16:02.178 --> 16:06.095
Can you get a search warrant
for his apartment?

16:06.095 --> 16:07.967
I've never had
to convince a perp

16:07.967 --> 16:09.359
of his own innocence before.

16:09.359 --> 16:12.275
Well,
first time for everything.

16:12.275 --> 16:13.885
<i>Well, you already got
a piece of my hair.</i>

16:13.885 --> 16:15.148
<i>What's next, a polygraph?</i>

16:15.148 --> 16:16.497
<i>If it comes to that.</i>

16:16.497 --> 16:17.977
What the hell is
going on in there?

16:17.977 --> 16:19.282
I'll tell you
on the drive up.

16:19.282 --> 16:20.631
<i>Please state your name
and badge number.</i>

16:20.631 --> 16:22.198
<i>No, I'm not going
to answer her.</i>

16:22.198 --> 16:23.634
She's just a White Shield.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.419
Who just spent a year
in the Bronx

16:25.419 --> 16:27.290
seeing what happens
when guys like you

16:27.290 --> 16:29.989
distort the values of this job.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.121
You know,
it's cops like you

16:32.121 --> 16:33.818
that are the reason why
people are protesting

16:33.818 --> 16:35.298
outside of city hall.

16:35.298 --> 16:36.821
But since I have
been on the job,

16:36.821 --> 16:40.216
I have yet to see Black folks
marching against firemen.

16:40.216 --> 16:43.959
Lying to one banger does
not warrant a drug test,

16:43.959 --> 16:46.048
let alone a protest.

16:46.048 --> 16:48.833
Explain how you know about
a double murder in Fort Worth,

16:48.833 --> 16:50.270
and we're done.

16:50.270 --> 16:54.230
That's if your drug test
comes back clean.

16:54.230 --> 16:58.495
How do you know so much
about a dead father and son

16:58.495 --> 17:02.325
in Fort Worth?

17:02.325 --> 17:04.806
Velasco.

17:04.806 --> 17:07.896
Because.

17:07.896 --> 17:09.985
I was there.

17:14.990 --> 17:17.427
They slept in
separate bedrooms.

17:17.427 --> 17:19.299
I can't say that I blame her.

17:19.299 --> 17:21.170
I found this on
Humphreys' night table.

17:21.170 --> 17:23.216
- What is that?
- It's an apnea machine.

17:23.216 --> 17:25.957
He must have been
quite an intense snorer.

17:25.957 --> 17:27.829
What are you doing?
- I'm looking for a shotgun.

17:27.829 --> 17:29.700
Keep this between us?

17:29.700 --> 17:31.833
- Snitches get stitches.
- That's right.

17:31.833 --> 17:32.964
What is that?

17:32.964 --> 17:34.879
It's not a shotgun.

17:34.879 --> 17:36.142
I thought they
didn't have kids.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.186
They don't.

17:37.186 --> 17:41.538
Pence Humphreys, signed 1973.

17:41.538 --> 17:43.323
Oh, that's the only thing
in the locked drawer?

17:43.323 --> 17:46.413
Yeah, her desk.
My guess?

17:46.413 --> 17:48.154
She was keeping it safe
for him.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.807
I mean, look at this place.

17:49.807 --> 17:51.679
It's like a--it's like a
shrine to their love story.

17:51.679 --> 17:55.030
I can barely find somebody
who's emotionally available.

17:55.030 --> 17:58.164
Suicide never
looked so romantic.

17:58.164 --> 18:00.427
Except he didn't do it.

18:00.427 --> 18:02.733
CPAP has a digital log.

18:02.733 --> 18:07.129
Homicide said that the murder
was at 11:00 PM.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.479
This says he woke up
around 10:00

18:09.479 --> 18:12.700
and was up for one minute,
23 seconds.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.745
That's not even enough time
to smother the vic,

18:14.745 --> 18:16.356
let alone rape her.

18:16.356 --> 18:19.098
How's that for facts?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.969
I just need you
to look at these times.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.449
Do you understand
these numbers?

18:22.449 --> 18:24.103
That doesn't prove anything.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.887
It proves that
he didn't murder his wife.

18:25.887 --> 18:28.672
You need to be clear with me.

18:28.672 --> 18:32.111
I need to under--
Winnie is dead?

18:32.111 --> 18:34.156
And I--I didn't do it?

18:34.156 --> 18:36.027
No, you didn't,
Mr. Humphreys.

18:36.027 --> 18:38.291
I'm--I'm sorry.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.858
Is it possible
he kept the machine on

18:40.858 --> 18:42.382
while he committed the act?

18:42.382 --> 18:44.384
How long do you think the
hose of a CPAP machine is?

18:44.384 --> 18:46.037
It should--
it should have been me.

18:46.037 --> 18:48.214
We--we--we had a pact.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.737
We made a commitment.
- No.

18:49.737 --> 18:51.173
Do you understand?

18:51.173 --> 18:53.219
The last face she saw
wasn't mine?

18:53.219 --> 18:54.829
She must have been terrif--

18:54.829 --> 18:57.223
I need--I need to know

18:57.223 --> 18:59.007
who did--who did this!

18:59.007 --> 19:01.227
She did not see my face!

19:01.227 --> 19:03.316
She--she must have been
terr--who did this?

19:03.316 --> 19:05.056
- We're doing everything--
- Who--who did this?

19:05.056 --> 19:06.188
We're doing
everything we can.

19:06.188 --> 19:07.233
Who would want to hurt her?

19:07.233 --> 19:09.670
I--I--I don't understand.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.585
Guys, guys, give--
give us a moment.

19:11.585 --> 19:13.108
Thanks.
- Take all the time you need.

19:13.108 --> 19:14.414
I don't--I don't--

19:14.414 --> 19:15.328
I don't understand
where--where--

19:15.328 --> 19:16.459
Hey, I understand.

19:16.459 --> 19:18.505
I don't understand!

19:18.505 --> 19:20.985
Poor guy.

19:20.985 --> 19:23.379
We took his
only comfort away.

19:23.379 --> 19:25.773
He wishes he was brave enough
to do it himself.

19:27.296 --> 19:28.515
- Jeez.
- Oh, my God.

19:28.515 --> 19:29.429
Ah!

19:29.429 --> 19:32.171
Jesus, call a bus.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.259
Get away from me.
Leave me alone.

19:33.259 --> 19:34.390
Hey, go get some help
right now!

19:34.390 --> 19:36.740
Mr. Humphreys,
what did you do?

19:36.740 --> 19:39.047
Go--go get me some help.

19:39.047 --> 19:41.005
Oh, my God.
- Please let me go.

19:41.005 --> 19:42.703
Here, come here. Shh.

19:42.703 --> 19:44.444
I don't want to
be here anymore.

19:44.444 --> 19:45.923
I don't want to live
without her.

19:45.923 --> 19:47.838
I know.
I know you don't.

19:47.838 --> 19:49.884
Please let me go.

19:49.884 --> 19:52.495
Please.
- It's OK.

19:52.495 --> 19:53.888
It's OK.

19:59.981 --> 20:01.939
Doctor, how's he doing?

20:01.939 --> 20:03.680
Cuts on his wrist
were superficial.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.595
Emotionally is another story.

20:05.595 --> 20:07.641
We have him on
anti-anxiety meds,

20:07.641 --> 20:08.946
waiting for a psych eval.

20:08.946 --> 20:10.296
He shouldn't be alone
right now.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.559
Don't worry. He's not.
He's with his caregiver.

20:12.559 --> 20:13.734
Virginia Wise.

20:13.734 --> 20:15.170
Homicide cops
mentioned her name.

20:15.170 --> 20:16.693
Is he lucid enough
to speak with us?

20:16.693 --> 20:19.130
An hour after sundown?

20:19.130 --> 20:22.525
Usually when patients like him
are at their worst.

20:22.525 --> 20:24.701
Right, thank you.

20:24.701 --> 20:26.616
No, rest.

20:26.616 --> 20:28.879
Mm.

20:28.879 --> 20:30.185
My heart breaks.

20:30.185 --> 20:32.143
He keeps trying to call Winnie.

20:32.143 --> 20:34.668
So I already told the homicide
detectives everything I know.

20:34.668 --> 20:37.061
Pence confessed to them.
I thought he did it.

20:37.061 --> 20:39.934
No, actually, he just
thinks that he did it.

20:39.934 --> 20:42.241
So the killer's
still out there then?

20:42.241 --> 20:43.851
That's a frightening thought.

20:43.851 --> 20:45.026
Which is why we need
to talk to you.

20:45.026 --> 20:46.375
Can we do it later?

20:46.375 --> 20:48.464
My husband's waiting
for me in the car.

20:48.464 --> 20:50.074
I've had little time
for a personal life.

20:50.074 --> 20:51.728
Of course.
We understand.

20:51.728 --> 20:53.774
No, don't go.

20:53.774 --> 20:57.952
I do--I don't want
to be alone.

20:57.952 --> 21:02.261
I know it seems cruel now,
but in five minutes,

21:02.261 --> 21:04.611
he won't remember
I was even here.

21:07.570 --> 21:11.139
Mr. Humphreys, how you doing?

21:12.967 --> 21:16.840
I'm Captain Benson.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.016
I never forget
a gorgeous face.

21:19.016 --> 21:20.540
Oh.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.455
Or an hourglass figure.

21:22.455 --> 21:25.762
Well, uh, the cafeteria
downstairs may have just added

21:25.762 --> 21:27.416
a few extra minutes to it.

21:27.416 --> 21:29.331
I'm sorry.

21:29.331 --> 21:30.593
For what?

21:30.593 --> 21:32.116
I am a terrible flirt.

21:32.116 --> 21:35.729
Please don't tell Winnie.

21:35.729 --> 21:37.861
Your secret's safe with me.

21:37.861 --> 21:39.776
Who's this?

21:39.776 --> 21:41.343
Just a lawyer.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.389
You know why
God created them?

21:43.389 --> 21:45.347
So that toilet plungers
would have

21:45.347 --> 21:47.871
something to look down on.

21:47.871 --> 21:50.265
That's--that's good.
I haven't heard that one.

21:50.265 --> 21:53.224
Well, we--we just
wanted to make sure

21:53.224 --> 21:55.792
that you were all right,
you know?

21:55.792 --> 21:58.012
We were worried about you.

21:58.012 --> 22:00.144
Winnie--Winnie
is worried, too.

22:00.144 --> 22:02.756
I know she's expecting my call.

22:02.756 --> 22:04.279
I would invite you
to dinner,

22:04.279 --> 22:06.107
but I don't want
to surprise her.

22:06.107 --> 22:10.329
We actually just ate
downstairs in the cafeteria.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.200
Why don't we, uh--
we'll leave you in peace.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.594
Yeah.
All right, we'll see you later.

22:14.594 --> 22:19.599
An ass like the devil and
a face like Jayne Mansfield.

22:19.599 --> 22:22.558
You're a lucky son of a bitch,
whoever you are.

22:28.695 --> 22:32.699
So in the last two hours,
the guy recants his confession,

22:32.699 --> 22:34.178
he tries to kill himself,

22:34.178 --> 22:36.355
and forgets that
his wife is even dead.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.095
The jury is going to need
instant replay.

22:38.095 --> 22:39.445
Yeah, well,
it's their cross to bear.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.490
But if he didn't kill her,
who did?

22:41.490 --> 22:43.884
Well, there's no sign
of forced entry.

22:43.884 --> 22:45.581
Did Homicide mention
who has the key

22:45.581 --> 22:46.756
to the Humphreys' apartment?

22:46.756 --> 22:48.149
Well, far as
the caregiver tells it,

22:48.149 --> 22:49.498
Humphreys liked to wander.

22:49.498 --> 22:51.152
Her and Winnie
had the only keys.

22:51.152 --> 22:53.110
Well,
the caregiver is married.

22:53.110 --> 22:54.677
Any chance that
the husband did it?

22:54.677 --> 22:56.026
They were at a
family gathering

22:56.026 --> 22:57.463
the night of the murder.
Homicide checked her out.

22:57.463 --> 22:59.508
Well, at least
they checked something.

22:59.508 --> 23:02.946
Maybe she lost the key,
or it got stolen.

23:02.946 --> 23:04.861
Is it possible
that Winnie opened

23:04.861 --> 23:06.428
the door to her own killer?

23:06.428 --> 23:08.430
I'd like to think
that Homicide

23:08.430 --> 23:10.519
checked the lobby cams
in the Humphreys' building.

23:10.519 --> 23:12.434
Like you said, Liv,
they had a confession.

23:12.434 --> 23:16.743
I mean, how hard did
they really look?

23:16.743 --> 23:21.095
I'll call TARU,
get the footage.

23:21.095 --> 23:22.662
- So you were there?
- I already told you that!

23:22.662 --> 23:25.229
Velasco, what were you doing
at a murder scene in 2003?

23:25.229 --> 23:26.666
Do I got to get
my union lawyer?

23:26.666 --> 23:27.884
Because I feel like
I might need a lawyer.

23:27.884 --> 23:29.277
No need for that.

23:29.277 --> 23:30.626
All we want is the truth,
all right?

23:30.626 --> 23:31.932
Not half, not a trickle of it.

23:31.932 --> 23:34.151
I was just a kid,
and I didn't have

23:34.151 --> 23:37.111
the benefit of growing up
middle class in Ann Arbor.

23:37.111 --> 23:38.373
How do you know
where I'm from?

23:38.373 --> 23:39.592
And my parents were
not intellectuals.

23:39.592 --> 23:40.941
Wait, you looked
into my background?

23:40.941 --> 23:42.029
Duarte and I
were talking about

23:42.029 --> 23:43.596
how you got
a stick up your ass.

23:43.596 --> 23:45.380
- Don't talk about Duarte!
- OK, both you guys, shut up!

23:45.380 --> 23:46.903
All right? It's getting late.

23:46.903 --> 23:48.949
Velasco, I'm not going
to ask you again.

23:48.949 --> 23:52.518
How'd you wind up
at a murder scene?

23:52.518 --> 23:56.043
My first job was delivering
bread in Juarez, OK?

23:56.043 --> 23:59.438
And one day,
I met a guy on my route that

23:59.438 --> 24:02.353
offered me
and my boy Chilly a job.

24:02.353 --> 24:03.920
He said that if we go
through the training,

24:03.920 --> 24:06.183
we'd be security guards.

24:06.183 --> 24:09.143
It was $180 a week.
I was 15 years old.

24:09.143 --> 24:10.449
You weren't even
old enough to drive.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.929
Like I said,
we grew up different.

24:12.929 --> 24:16.367
Let him finish, Churlish.

24:16.367 --> 24:20.023
So they sent us to a camp.

24:20.023 --> 24:22.025
Turned out to be a
school for sicarios.

24:22.025 --> 24:23.592
For hitmen.

24:23.592 --> 24:25.333
The guy that recruited me
said that the only way

24:25.333 --> 24:27.248
to leave was in a body bag.

24:27.248 --> 24:30.120
So me and my boy Chilly,
we was there for three months

24:30.120 --> 24:31.774
training how to use weapons.

24:31.774 --> 24:35.865
And then as a final test,
they made us go to Fort Worth.

24:35.865 --> 24:38.128
So I go, gun in hand.

24:38.128 --> 24:39.478
And I was ready to do the hit.

24:39.478 --> 24:42.785
And as soon as his son
comes out,

24:42.785 --> 24:46.310
I, uh...

24:46.310 --> 24:48.095
I lost my nerve.
I couldn't do it.

24:48.095 --> 24:49.313
Chilly could.

24:49.313 --> 24:54.144
He covered for me
with the cartel.

24:54.144 --> 24:55.668
I didn't really belong.

24:55.668 --> 24:56.973
So you ran?

24:56.973 --> 24:59.585
Yeah,
even here in New York,

24:59.585 --> 25:01.456
I'm still checking
my surroundings.

25:01.456 --> 25:03.197
Is this the first time
you told that story

25:03.197 --> 25:05.329
to someone other than
that banger?

25:05.329 --> 25:07.288
Yeah, it feels good
to get it off my chest.

25:07.288 --> 25:10.813
Still,
you're loyal to a killer.

25:15.644 --> 25:18.168
Corey and Yvonne Barksdale,
apartment 8C,

25:18.168 --> 25:19.822
coming home from
visiting her parents.

25:19.822 --> 25:21.694
Kay, keep going.

25:21.694 --> 25:24.000
Larry Trimble, 11F,
with his dogs.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.175
Yeah, we can see that.

25:25.175 --> 25:27.090
- Want the dogs' names, too?
- OK.

25:27.090 --> 25:28.962
Thank you.

25:28.962 --> 25:33.662
Last entry into the building,
food delivery guy.

25:33.662 --> 25:35.534
To which apartment?

25:40.408 --> 25:42.323
You mean you didn't
interview him?

25:42.323 --> 25:44.238
We had a confession.

25:54.248 --> 25:56.555
30 minutes
to deliver takeout?

25:56.555 --> 25:58.731
Did you check
with DoorJet

25:58.731 --> 26:01.168
to see if they had
a delivery scheduled

26:01.168 --> 26:04.606
to that building that night?

26:16.313 --> 26:18.968
Mr. Humphreys, will you
just take another look?

26:18.968 --> 26:22.058
Don't you think it's time
that you called me Pence?

26:22.058 --> 26:24.757
Pence.

26:24.757 --> 26:27.673
You have warm eyes.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.457
Eyes are the window
to the soul.

26:29.457 --> 26:30.632
You know what?

26:30.632 --> 26:32.503
Clichés are clichés
for a reason.

26:32.503 --> 26:35.811
It's because our brains
gravitate to what is familiar.

26:35.811 --> 26:39.554
We want patterns,
things that fit together.

26:39.554 --> 26:45.255
And I'm trapped in
a wilderness of ambiguities.

26:45.255 --> 26:48.911
I wouldn't wish this
on my worst enemies,

26:48.911 --> 26:53.133
not even the man
on the security video,

26:53.133 --> 26:55.309
whoever he is.

26:55.309 --> 26:57.267
You expect my client
to remember

26:57.267 --> 26:59.966
if his wife ordered food
the night she was killed?

26:59.966 --> 27:01.315
Well, nobody else
in that building did.

27:01.315 --> 27:03.447
You know how we know that?
Because we checked.

27:03.447 --> 27:05.667
Then why didn't police find
any evidence

27:05.667 --> 27:07.277
of takeout in the apartment?

27:07.277 --> 27:09.932
I do know that man.

27:09.932 --> 27:13.283
I do. I do. It's...

27:13.283 --> 27:16.199
He delivered food
to your apartment?

27:16.199 --> 27:19.463
No, he--he--he came to
the apartment about a month ago

27:19.463 --> 27:21.074
to pick up Virginia.

27:21.074 --> 27:23.729
I remember it was snowing,
and his--

27:23.729 --> 27:28.342
his--his galoshes tracked
puddles into the library.

27:28.342 --> 27:32.955
Winnie bellowed
like a bull-roarer.

27:32.955 --> 27:35.697
That's Virginia's nephew.
That's Kevin.

27:39.396 --> 27:42.443
You have warm eyes.

27:42.443 --> 27:46.142
His are--they're cold.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.624
What's your boy
Chilly's real name?

27:49.624 --> 27:52.235
Why, so you can call Dallas PD
and have them pick him up?

27:52.235 --> 27:55.630
Maybe.

27:55.630 --> 27:57.501
I'd rather not say.

27:57.501 --> 27:59.373
So you're gonna keep
protecting a murderer?

27:59.373 --> 28:01.680
Chilly is the only reason
I'm alive.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.813
Look, man, you're not half
a hitman from Juarez anymore.

28:04.813 --> 28:06.510
You're a NYPD officer.

28:06.510 --> 28:09.426
And why do you think I became
a cop in the first place?

28:09.426 --> 28:11.820
Penance.
I get it.

28:11.820 --> 28:14.475
I didn't kill anyone, Sarge.

28:18.522 --> 28:20.655
We all make mistakes, OK?

28:20.655 --> 28:24.833
And even in the NYPD,
there's room for redemption.

28:24.833 --> 28:27.183
But you don't think
Benson sees it like that?

28:27.183 --> 28:28.707
You're not asking
for my advice,

28:28.707 --> 28:31.492
but I'ma give it to you anyway.

28:31.492 --> 28:34.016
Show your loyalty to her,

28:34.016 --> 28:37.324
not me, not the NYPD,

28:37.324 --> 28:39.195
and definitely
not someone guilty

28:39.195 --> 28:42.372
of an unsolved double murder
in Fort Worth.

28:50.554 --> 28:52.818
So that's the nephew.
What do we know about him?

28:52.818 --> 28:54.950
Kevin Wise, 20 years old.
He's unemployed.

28:54.950 --> 28:56.865
And he has an alibi
for the night of?

28:56.865 --> 28:59.781
Yeah, he says he was
home alone on SugarFap.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.217
He even thought ahead.

29:01.217 --> 29:02.784
He left his computer open
to some cam girl

29:02.784 --> 29:05.874
who vouched for him, but then
the unis found a checkbook

29:05.874 --> 29:07.833
from the Humphreys' joint
account in a garbage bag

29:07.833 --> 29:09.748
under his bed.
- OK, so enough to arrest.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.576
Do we have enough to convict?

29:12.576 --> 29:15.666
His DNA is not
on the rape kit.

29:15.666 --> 29:17.494
So what do you need?

29:17.494 --> 29:20.019
Pence Humphreys to ID him.

29:21.890 --> 29:23.544
I--I--I don't know.

29:23.544 --> 29:25.589
Hold on.
Let's just slow down, Pence.

29:25.589 --> 29:27.853
- I don't know.
- Can we take another look?

29:27.853 --> 29:29.158
It's been five minutes, counselor.

29:29.158 --> 29:31.465
He'll take as long
as he takes.

29:31.465 --> 29:33.467
Hey, Pence, look at me.

29:33.467 --> 29:36.687
Look at me.

29:36.687 --> 29:39.386
Just take a breath.

29:41.954 --> 29:44.347
Now, look back.

29:44.347 --> 29:46.088
Look back.

29:46.088 --> 29:49.439
Do you see the man
who tracked puddles

29:49.439 --> 29:51.920
into your apartment
a month ago,

29:51.920 --> 29:54.618
the man who made Winnie bellow?

29:59.972 --> 30:03.497
Yeah, it's number one.

30:03.497 --> 30:05.107
Number one. I'm positive.

30:05.107 --> 30:08.589
That's--that's
Virginia's nephew, Kevin.

30:08.589 --> 30:10.112
He was in our apartment.

30:10.112 --> 30:13.942
Winnie gave him a towel
to wipe off his galoshes.

30:13.942 --> 30:16.031
It's--it's number one.

30:16.031 --> 30:17.859
OK, I need a minute
with my client,

30:17.859 --> 30:20.296
and we will be making a motion
to dismiss all charges.

30:20.296 --> 30:22.864
- That's not happening.
- Good luck, counselor.

30:22.864 --> 30:25.649
What does that mean?
It wasn't him?

30:25.649 --> 30:28.827
No, it wasn't,

30:28.827 --> 30:31.220
but you know that.

30:34.049 --> 30:37.400
- I do?
- Let me drive you home, Pence.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.228
You know what?
I--I need a second.

30:39.228 --> 30:42.623
Go ahead.
I'll be right there.

30:42.623 --> 30:45.452
- Can we still make this case?
- I have to call the 8th floor.

30:45.452 --> 30:46.975
We still have a few cards
we can play.

30:46.975 --> 30:48.977
Let's start with
Kevin's Aunt Virginia.

30:48.977 --> 30:50.892
You don't think
she'll protect him?

30:50.892 --> 30:53.025
Not if I charge her
with obstruction.

31:07.996 --> 31:11.913
Why did you lie?

31:11.913 --> 31:15.525
This disease is like
the teeth of God

31:15.525 --> 31:19.355
biting into a liqueur chocolate
and sucking all the memories

31:19.355 --> 31:22.141
out of your head
like a maraschino cherry,

31:22.141 --> 31:25.100
and there is no cure.

31:27.668 --> 31:32.151
I'm afraid all days will
suffer the agony of breaking,

31:32.151 --> 31:36.938
so I would rather go down
like this,

31:36.938 --> 31:39.332
in prison.

31:39.332 --> 31:42.335
The moment those
cell doors close,

31:42.335 --> 31:47.383
I won't remember
where I am or why.

31:47.383 --> 31:50.386
That stupid kid in there...

31:50.386 --> 31:53.389
He's going to remember everything.

31:53.389 --> 31:56.523
Some memories are worse
than prison.

32:00.570 --> 32:05.271
Is that fair to Winnie?

32:05.271 --> 32:09.710
Is that what she would want?

32:09.710 --> 32:13.888
Winnie is still with me.

32:13.888 --> 32:18.675
We have been more in love in
the last few years than ever.

32:20.329 --> 32:23.419
Before, I--I was--
I was logical.

32:23.419 --> 32:25.726
I was objective,
"King of the Moon."

32:25.726 --> 32:28.729
But since the diagnosis,
everything changed.

32:30.687 --> 32:34.474
In different sliver of moon,

32:34.474 --> 32:36.955
it's full...

32:39.131 --> 32:42.047
And maybe--
maybe even a little forgiving.

32:45.659 --> 32:49.880
And Winnie knows that.

32:49.880 --> 32:53.493
No one knows that
more than Winnie.

33:00.021 --> 33:02.458
We already explained
those items.

33:02.458 --> 33:03.372
Yeah, that they were given
to your client by his aunt?

33:03.372 --> 33:04.678
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, that's right.

33:04.678 --> 33:06.027
No, not according to
her statement to the DA.

33:06.027 --> 33:07.463
She wants nothing
to do with you.

33:07.463 --> 33:09.204
Oh, and there's more.

33:09.204 --> 33:12.338
She IDed these rings
and these bracelets

33:12.338 --> 33:14.818
as belonging to Mrs. Humphreys.

33:14.818 --> 33:16.472
We found them in your
girlfriend's apartment.

33:16.472 --> 33:20.215
It's over.

33:20.215 --> 33:22.478
- I didn't mean to kill her.
- Kevin, stop talking.

33:22.478 --> 33:24.002
Counselor,
if this goes to trial,

33:24.002 --> 33:26.091
the jury's going to hear
about the 40-year love story

33:26.091 --> 33:28.615
of a woman who was
smothered without mercy,

33:28.615 --> 33:31.226
and he'll get no mercy.

33:34.142 --> 33:36.449
How did you get the key,
Kevin?

33:40.670 --> 33:43.543
I stole it from
my aunt's purse.

33:43.543 --> 33:45.153
She told me these
stories about how

33:45.153 --> 33:48.330
this guy was mad rich,
threw $40,000 in a trash chute

33:48.330 --> 33:49.679
by accident.

33:49.679 --> 33:50.767
And you figured
that nobody was

33:50.767 --> 33:51.725
going to notice what you took?

33:51.725 --> 33:53.509
I needed money.

33:53.509 --> 33:55.076
DoorJet don't pay as much
as people think.

33:55.076 --> 33:56.599
Tell me what happened.
Don't lie to me.

33:56.599 --> 34:01.126
I waited for somebody
to leave, got into the lobby.

34:01.126 --> 34:03.302
I went up to the
Humphreys' apartment.

34:03.302 --> 34:06.914
I was trying to be quiet,
but she must have woke up.

34:06.914 --> 34:09.047
She came out of the
bedroom screaming.

34:09.047 --> 34:14.313
I told her to be quiet,
but she wouldn't.

34:14.313 --> 34:17.011
So I--I pushed her down.

34:17.011 --> 34:20.275
I put a pillow over her face.

34:20.275 --> 34:24.149
She's old.

34:24.149 --> 34:28.718
She just died.

34:28.718 --> 34:31.721
The homicide detectives
said that they--

34:31.721 --> 34:35.638
they found her
nightgown pulled up.

34:35.638 --> 34:37.988
I didn't rape her.
I swear to God.

34:37.988 --> 34:41.079
But you thought about it.

34:41.079 --> 34:44.299
Kevin,

34:44.299 --> 34:49.957
we all build walls
within ourselves around...

34:49.957 --> 34:53.091
around the ugly things
that we've done.

34:53.091 --> 34:57.138
And sometimes those walls
can be more confining than--

34:57.138 --> 35:00.750
than prison.

35:00.750 --> 35:03.840
I need you to be honest
with us now, kay?

35:03.840 --> 35:05.886
I have been.

35:05.886 --> 35:09.237
Kevin, somebody put
that blanket over her

35:09.237 --> 35:11.979
to preserve her dignity,

35:11.979 --> 35:15.591
or maybe they were preserving
their own dignity.

35:15.591 --> 35:17.506
From what?

35:17.506 --> 35:20.248
From what you did.

35:20.248 --> 35:22.207
It's OK.

35:22.207 --> 35:27.516
OK, yeah,
I did it with her.

35:27.516 --> 35:29.779
But...

35:29.779 --> 35:34.697
it was before she was dead.

35:34.697 --> 35:36.830
And I used a condom.

35:45.926 --> 35:48.407
- Close your case?
- The kid confessed.

35:48.407 --> 35:51.061
Carisi is going for
rape and murder one.

35:51.061 --> 35:52.802
- What about the husband?
- Pence?

35:52.802 --> 35:55.414
He is in an empty apartment,

35:55.414 --> 35:59.809
alone for the rest of his life.

35:59.809 --> 36:01.028
Where's Velasco?

36:01.028 --> 36:03.596
Sent him home
to take a shower.

36:03.596 --> 36:06.642
- He tell you the truth?
- Yeah, he told me the truth.

36:06.642 --> 36:08.209
He's ready to tell you.

36:08.209 --> 36:10.646
And I think everyone
deserves a second chance.

36:10.646 --> 36:13.127
I'll consider it.

36:13.127 --> 36:17.175
I was impressed
with Churlish.

36:17.175 --> 36:20.700
Really, Fin?
Another stray?

36:23.920 --> 36:26.227
Have her come see me tomorrow.

36:32.364 --> 36:34.061
So Sarge catch you up?

36:34.061 --> 36:35.497
He did.

36:35.497 --> 36:39.719
You should know that
your drug test came back.

36:39.719 --> 36:42.330
- And?
- It was positive.

36:42.330 --> 36:44.332
Positive for what?

36:44.332 --> 36:47.596
Powdered sugar.

36:47.596 --> 36:49.816
You know, Captain, if my
loyalty was ever questioned,

36:49.816 --> 36:51.209
I think that--

36:51.209 --> 36:54.255
I feel bad for you, Velasco.

36:54.255 --> 36:57.476
Bad?

36:57.476 --> 36:59.478
Bad how?

36:59.478 --> 37:05.266
Because you're 180 pounds of
water in the shape of a man,

37:05.266 --> 37:07.877
and you take on the shape
of anything

37:07.877 --> 37:11.620
that you're poured into.

37:11.620 --> 37:14.188
Duarte asked you
to flip a banger,

37:14.188 --> 37:16.886
and you end up playing
just as dirty as the guy

37:16.886 --> 37:18.932
that we're hunting.

37:18.932 --> 37:20.890
I mean,
up until now, Velasco,

37:20.890 --> 37:24.285
you've been living
a performance,

37:24.285 --> 37:27.897
not a life.

37:27.897 --> 37:30.465
That changes now.

37:30.465 --> 37:32.511
Understood?

37:32.511 --> 37:34.643
What do you want me to do?

37:34.643 --> 37:38.647
You owe a debt to
the two people that were killed,

37:38.647 --> 37:40.954
even though they
were drug dealers.

37:40.954 --> 37:42.477
It doesn't have
to happen today,

37:42.477 --> 37:46.089
and it doesn't have
to happen tomorrow.

37:46.089 --> 37:49.354
But you will find that friend,

37:49.354 --> 37:54.141
and you will bring him
to justice.

37:54.141 --> 37:58.101
Captain, wait.
People change, you know?

37:58.101 --> 38:03.803
Velasco, being a cop
isn't some sort of penance.

38:03.803 --> 38:06.327
Putting your friend away
for murder is.

38:06.327 --> 38:08.286
So that's what it takes for
me and you to be all right?

38:08.286 --> 38:12.986
That's what it takes for me
and you to be all right.

38:27.957 --> 38:30.308
"King of the Moon.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.614
"Once upon a time,
there was a boy

38:32.614 --> 38:36.749
"named Jack who lived on Earth.

38:36.749 --> 38:39.404
"Jack loved looking up
at the night sky

38:39.404 --> 38:42.755
"and dreaming about
all the wonderful things

38:42.755 --> 38:45.061
"that might be out there.

38:45.061 --> 38:48.195
"One night,
while gazing up at the moon,

38:48.195 --> 38:51.416
<i>Jack had a magical dream."</i>

38:54.244 --> 38:57.900
<i>"In his dream, he was
transported to the moon..."</i>

39:01.382 --> 39:04.733
<i>"Where he found himself
all alone.</i>

39:04.733 --> 39:08.694
"At first, Jack was a little
scared to be all by himself

39:08.694 --> 39:10.043
"on the moon.

39:10.043 --> 39:12.654
"But as he explored,
he began to see

39:12.654 --> 39:15.570
<i>"the benefits of being alone.</i>

39:15.570 --> 39:17.485
<i>"There was no one
to laugh at him</i>

39:17.485 --> 39:20.096
<i>"or to make fun
of his stutter.</i>

39:20.096 --> 39:23.970
<i>"So Jack decided to
make the moon his home.</i>

39:23.970 --> 39:26.451
"He built a fort made
out of moon rocks,

39:26.451 --> 39:30.933
"and he spent his days exploring
and having adventures.

39:31.847 --> 39:35.285
<i>"As the days went by,
Jack began to love</i>

39:35.285 --> 39:40.856
"living on the moon, more love
than he had found on Earth.

39:40.856 --> 39:43.206
"And he was able to be himself

39:43.206 --> 39:46.384
"without anyone seeing
all his flaws.

39:46.384 --> 39:49.517
<i>"But no matter how
much fun he had,</i>

39:49.517 --> 39:52.825
<i>"Jack always knew that he
would have to return to Earth</i>

39:52.825 --> 39:55.741
<i>"someday, and he would
need to find someone</i>

39:55.741 --> 39:59.048
<i>"who loved him the way
he loved the moon</i>

39:59.048 --> 40:01.877
<i>"despite its many craters.</i>

40:01.877 --> 40:05.707
<i>"Eventually, Jack's time
on the moon came to an end,</i>

40:05.707 --> 40:08.536
<i>"and he had to say goodbye
to his fort</i>

40:08.536 --> 40:11.713
<i>and to all the adventures
that he had there."</i>

40:11.713 --> 40:13.672
Perendinate.

40:13.672 --> 40:15.848
P-E-R-E-N...

40:15.848 --> 40:19.329
D-E...

40:19.329 --> 40:21.201
N-A-T-E.

40:21.201 --> 40:23.290
<i>"But even though
he was back on Earth,</i>

40:23.290 --> 40:25.945
<i>"Jack never forgot his time
as king of the moon.</i>

40:25.945 --> 40:30.950
<i>"And he knew that one day,
he would return again</i>

40:30.950 --> 40:34.301
<i>"and reign as its king
once more.</i>

40:34.301 --> 40:37.086
<i>"But this time, this time,</i>

40:37.086 --> 40:41.482
<i>with his queen by his side."</i>

40:56.584 --> 40:59.587
Goodnight.

40:59.587 --> 41:01.937
Goodnight, Winifred.
