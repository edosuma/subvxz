WEBVTT

00:00.771 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.605
AFTER AN INCIDENT AT SCHOOL...
 (gasps)

00:04.605 --> 00:06.006
(tires screech, thud)
 AAH!

00:06.006 --> 00:08.579
GABY WAS FORCED TO REPLACE
THE P.T.A. PRESIDENT.

00:08.579 --> 00:09.640
ME?

00:11.011 --> 00:13.644
CARLOS WAS STRUGGLING
WITH HIS GUILT.

00:13.644 --> 00:17.618
THIS IS NOT ME. I CAN'T SLEEP.
I'M SEEING GHOSTS.

00:17.618 --> 00:18.789
I KNOW.

00:18.789 --> 00:21.322
SUSAN FOUND A WAY TO COPE.

00:21.322 --> 00:25.756
I'M TAKING A PAINTING CLASS
BEING TAUGHT BY ANDRE ZELLER.
 GREAT.

00:25.756 --> 00:28.799
BUT THE FAMOUS PAINTER
DIDN'T MAKE IT EASY.

00:28.799 --> 00:30.631
YOU'RE A BORED HOUSEWIFE
TRYING TO KILL TIME

00:30.631 --> 00:34.765
BETWEEN SPIN CLASS AND DRIVING
YOUR KID TO SOCCER PRACTICE.

00:34.765 --> 00:37.738
AND LYNETTE DISCOVERED
THAT SINCE THEIR SEPARATION,

00:37.738 --> 00:40.111
TOM HAD STARTED DATING.

00:40.111 --> 00:42.042
IT'S JUST A COUPLE OF DINNERS
AND... COFFEE.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.675
GOD, TOM. WHEN WERE YOU
GONNA TELL ME THIS?

00:49.680 --> 00:52.153
(Mary Alice)
IN THEIR 20 YEARS TOGETHER,

00:52.153 --> 00:56.257
TOM AND LYNETTE SCAVO HAD
FOLLOWED A FEW SIMPLE RULES...

00:57.828 --> 01:00.231
ALWAYS SHARE THE HOUSEWORK...

01:02.693 --> 01:06.066
NEVER WASTE THE HOT WATER,

01:06.066 --> 01:10.471
AND NEVER, EVER
GO TO BED ANGRY.

01:10.471 --> 01:14.305
YES, THE RULES
FOR BEING TOGETHER WERE SIMPLE.

01:14.305 --> 01:16.707
BUT THE RULES
FOR BEING APART...

01:16.707 --> 01:19.750
WERE ANYTHING BUT.

01:19.750 --> 01:21.812
STOP CALLING IT "DATING."

01:21.812 --> 01:23.584
IT'S DINNER WITH A FRIEND.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.815
(snorts)

01:24.815 --> 01:27.358
DO NOT DO THAT.
DO NOT DO THE SNORT.

01:27.358 --> 01:29.760
COULD YOU MAKE HER STOP
SNORTING?

01:29.760 --> 01:31.392
LYNETTE,
I FIND IT MORE EFFECTIVE

01:31.392 --> 01:35.466
WHEN WE USE WORDS RATHER THAN
INFLAMMATORY NOISES.

01:35.466 --> 01:36.867
YOU WANT WORDS?
HERE ARE SOME WORDS.

01:36.867 --> 01:38.569
LIAR, LIAR, PANTS ON FIRE.

01:38.569 --> 01:42.633
LOBSTER FOR TWO AT CHEZ NOUS
IS NOT "DINNER WITH A FRIEND."

01:42.633 --> 01:44.835
A $300 NIGHT AT SAKURA

01:44.835 --> 01:47.438
IS NOT STRAPPING ON A FEEDBAG
WITH A BUDDY.

01:47.438 --> 01:50.110
I STILL DO
OUR CREDIT CARD BILLS, GENIUS.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.642
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH WORDS.

01:51.642 --> 01:52.783
HEY, IT'S NOT LIKE
I WENT LOOKING FOR THIS.

01:52.783 --> 01:54.785
JANE LIVES IN THE BUILDING.
WE GOT TO TALKING.

01:54.785 --> 01:57.148
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SHE WAS ACTUALLY NICE TO ME--

01:57.148 --> 01:58.889
SOMETHING I'M NOT USED TO.

01:58.889 --> 02:01.352
OH, I CAN'T SNORT,
BUT A DRIVE-BY LIKE THAT'S OKAY?

02:01.352 --> 02:03.754
ALL RIGHT, EMOTIONS ARE RUNNING
A LITTLE HOT,

02:03.754 --> 02:06.197
BUT I THINK I KNOW WHY.

02:06.197 --> 02:08.459
YOU TWO EMBARKED
ON THIS SEPARATION

02:08.459 --> 02:11.562
WITHOUT A CLEAR GOAL IN MIND.

02:11.562 --> 02:13.704
ARE YOU TRYING
TO GET BACK TOGETHER,

02:13.704 --> 02:14.835
OR ARE YOU TRYING TO FIND

02:14.835 --> 02:16.837
A GRACEFUL WAY
TO END THE MARRIAGE?

02:19.610 --> 02:23.414
WE DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE THIS
RIGHT NOW,

02:23.414 --> 02:28.919
BUT WE DO NEED TO LAY DOWN
SOME GROUND RULES.

02:28.919 --> 02:30.851
FOR EXAMPLE, ARE YOU DATING?

02:30.851 --> 02:32.583
HEIS.

02:32.583 --> 02:33.784
TWO DINNERS.

02:33.784 --> 02:35.556
ALL RIGHT,
SO YOUAREDATING.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.358
WHAT ABOUT SEX?

02:41.492 --> 02:43.764
NO.

02:43.764 --> 02:44.895
NOT YET.

02:44.895 --> 02:46.767
I-I... (cries)

02:46.767 --> 02:48.839
HE JUST ANSWERED
YOUR FIRST QUESTION.

02:48.839 --> 02:50.201
HE WANTS TO END THE MARRIAGE.

02:50.201 --> 02:51.672
NO, LYNETTE,
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

02:51.672 --> 02:52.773
I'M NOT GIVING UP.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.475
"NOT YET"?

02:54.475 --> 02:56.747
LOOK, I STILL HOPE THAT WE CAN
FIND A WAY TO WORK THINGS OUT,

02:56.747 --> 02:58.849
BUT... (sighs)

02:58.849 --> 03:01.512
WE DON'T
MAKE EACH OTHER HAPPY.

03:01.512 --> 03:05.786
WE HAVEN'T FOR ALONGTIME.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.458
SO WHAT IF--I MEAN,

03:07.458 --> 03:10.461
WHAT IF THERE WAS
SOMEONE OUT THERE WHOCOULD?

03:12.823 --> 03:15.396
I JUST FEEL LIKE
IF WE DON'T...

03:15.396 --> 03:18.299
EXPLORE...

03:18.299 --> 03:20.901
THEN WE ARE GONNA END UP RIGHT
BACK IN HERE, ON THIS COUCH,

03:20.901 --> 03:22.933
HATING EACH OTHER.

03:24.405 --> 03:27.238
SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE A LOT
TO CONSIDER.

03:27.238 --> 03:29.940
THERE'S NOTHING TO CONSIDER.

03:29.940 --> 03:32.483
WE'RE... CLEARED FOR SEX.

03:32.483 --> 03:34.845
LET THE DATING BEGIN.

03:34.845 --> 03:37.288
YES, TOM AND LYNETTE
WERE LEARNING

03:37.288 --> 03:39.820
THE RULES OF SEPARATION.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.852
AND THE FIRST RULE?

03:41.852 --> 03:42.953
AND I CAN'T WAIT
TO LET MY NEW BOYFRIEND

03:42.953 --> 03:45.896
DO THAT THING
I NEVER LET YOU DO.

03:45.896 --> 03:48.829
THERE ARE NO RULES.

04:01.642 --> 04:02.943
IN ANY GROUP,

04:02.943 --> 04:06.517
THERE ARE ROLES THAT PEOPLE
ARE DESTINED TO PLAY--

04:06.517 --> 04:09.980
THE PERFECT HOMEMAKER
TO BRING THE SNACKS,

04:09.980 --> 04:13.854
THE FINANCIAL WIZARD
TO KEEP THE BOOKS...

04:13.854 --> 04:17.488
AND THE BUSYBODY
TO SHARE THE GOSSIP.

04:17.488 --> 04:21.962
BUT SOMETIMES
THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLE OF ALL

04:21.962 --> 04:23.464
GOES TO SOMEONE

04:23.464 --> 04:26.567
WHO'S NOT THE SLIGHTEST BIT
PREPARED FOR IT.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.970
HI, GUYS. I KNOW,
I'M A LITTLE BIT LATE.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.942
A LITTLE? TRY 45 MINUTES.

04:31.942 --> 04:33.944
WELL, ONCE YOU HEAR
WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH,

04:33.944 --> 04:36.046
YOU WILLTOTALLYUNDERSTAND.

04:36.046 --> 04:39.850
SO...YOU KNOW HOW IT'S CALLED
AHOTSTONE MASSAGE?

04:39.850 --> 04:41.051
SO THERE I AM AT THE SPA,

04:41.051 --> 04:43.554
LAID OUT WITH MY MOJITO,
MY "MARIE CLAIRE,"

04:43.554 --> 04:47.388
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I FEEL A COLD ROCK ON MY ASS.

04:49.019 --> 04:50.561
(chuckles) I KNOW!

04:50.561 --> 04:53.394
SO ARMANDO WAS ALL APOLOGETIC.
HE WANTED TO REHEAT THE ROCKS.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.895
BUT AT THIS POINT, I'M LIKE,

04:54.895 --> 04:56.927
"I'M SORRY. I'VE GOT
A P.T.A. MEETING TO RUN."

04:56.927 --> 04:58.699
IF YOU LEFT, WHY ARE YOU LATE?

04:58.699 --> 05:00.531
OH, ARMANDO FELT SO BAD,

05:00.531 --> 05:03.073
HE GAVE ME A COMPLIMENTARY
SEAWEED WRAP. (laughs)

05:03.073 --> 05:06.076
SO... WHAT'S ON THE AGENDA HERE?

05:06.076 --> 05:08.909
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO PLAN
TEACHER APPRECIATION NIGHT.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.942
MM. RIGHT, RIGHT.
SO WHO'S DOING WHAT FOR THAT?

05:11.942 --> 05:14.084
CINDY, YOU WANNA HANDLE
THE FOOD?

05:14.084 --> 05:15.446
NO.

05:15.446 --> 05:17.588
OKAY.

05:17.588 --> 05:20.320
RACHEL, YOU NEVER STOP TALKING.
YOU WANNA EMCEE?

05:20.320 --> 05:21.822
NO.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.755
OKAY, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

05:24.755 --> 05:27.898
WHAT'S GOING ON IS
YOU'VE WASTED OUR TIME.

05:27.898 --> 05:30.401
I'M LEAVING.
I HAVE TO PICK UP MY KIDS.

05:30.401 --> 05:32.563
I HAVE TO GET BACK TO MY JOB.

05:32.563 --> 05:34.965
I NEED TO TAKE MY MOTHER
TO CHEMO.

05:34.965 --> 05:36.967
WH--OKAY, OKAY. LET'S NOT PLAY
SAD-LIFE POKER HERE.

05:36.967 --> 05:38.639
I NEED YOUR HELP.

05:38.639 --> 05:41.542
YOU KNOW, WE WOULD LOVE
TO FRITTER AWAY OUR DAYS

05:41.542 --> 05:44.575
WITH MANICURES AND HAIRDRESSERS
AND SPA APPOINTMENTS,

05:44.575 --> 05:47.077
BUT WE'RE NOT LIKE YOU.
WE HAVE LIVES.

05:47.077 --> 05:49.049
SO YOU CAN DO
TEACHER APPRECIATION NIGHT

05:49.049 --> 05:51.622
ON YOUR OWN.

05:51.622 --> 05:53.083
WH--

05:53.083 --> 05:54.985
WELL, COULD YOU AT LEAST
FOLD UP YOUR CHAIRS

05:54.985 --> 05:57.057
AND STACK 'EM
ON THE ROLLING CART?

05:57.057 --> 05:58.629
AND CAN SOMEONE EMPTY
THE COFFEEPOT?

05:58.629 --> 05:59.790
YOU'DREALLYDO--

05:59.790 --> 06:01.662
(doors slam)

06:03.063 --> 06:06.437
JEEZ! TALK ABOUT SELFISH.

06:08.739 --> 06:10.801
(doorbell rings)

06:10.801 --> 06:12.943
(door squeaks)

06:12.943 --> 06:15.706
OH, THANK GOODNESS.
YOU'RE ALIVE.

06:17.478 --> 06:18.979
I'M SORRY, REVEREND.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.852
I KNOW THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN
TO CHURCH FOR A FEW SUNDAYS.

06:21.852 --> 06:24.755
A FEW? TRY FIVE.

06:24.755 --> 06:29.119
YOU KNOW WHO'S BEEN BRINGING
SNACKS TO FELLOWSHIP HOUR?

06:29.119 --> 06:30.691
HELEN JOHNSON.

06:30.691 --> 06:31.862
UGH. LET ME GUESS.

06:31.862 --> 06:33.794
BRAN MUFFINS
FROM THE MINI-MART?

06:33.794 --> 06:37.468
WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME?

06:37.468 --> 06:41.171
I SHOULD'VE CALLED YOU.

06:41.171 --> 06:43.173
IT'S JUST,
I HAVEN'T BEEN FEELING...

06:43.173 --> 06:46.106
(sighs) VERY SPIRITUAL LATELY.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.738
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR US

06:47.738 --> 06:51.081
TO LOSE OUR WAY SPIRITUALLY
FROM TIME TO TIME,

06:51.081 --> 06:53.043
TO FEEL...

06:53.043 --> 06:54.585
IN THE WOODS.

06:54.585 --> 06:57.718
INTERESTING CHOICE OF WORDS.
(chuckles)

06:59.790 --> 07:02.453
IT'S JUST THAT I...

07:02.453 --> 07:05.125
FEEL LIKE MAYBE
I'M NOT WORTHY OF...

07:05.125 --> 07:06.827
GOD'S LOVE RIGHT NOW,

07:06.827 --> 07:08.128
THAT...

07:08.128 --> 07:11.061
I'VE LOST MY CONNECTION
TO HIM.

07:11.061 --> 07:13.063
BUT HERE'S THE GOOD THING
ABOUT GOD, BREE--

07:13.063 --> 07:15.205
HE'S EASY TO FIND.

07:15.205 --> 07:18.909
JUST SEEK OUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE
IN NEED, AND THERE HE IS.

07:18.909 --> 07:21.842
IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO
THE NEEDY WITH YOU, DOESN'T IT?

07:21.842 --> 07:24.144
IT'S KIND OF IN
THE JOB DESCRIPTION. (chuckles)

07:24.144 --> 07:26.116
I HEAR YOUR NEW NEIGHBOR
BEN FAULKNER

07:26.116 --> 07:28.118
DOES WONDERFUL WORK
WITH THE HOMELESS.

07:28.118 --> 07:29.980
WHY DON'T YOU SPEAK TO HIM?

07:29.980 --> 07:32.052
PERHAPS I WILL. (chuckles)

07:32.052 --> 07:33.183
(chuckles)

07:33.183 --> 07:36.226
THANK YOU, REVEREND.

07:36.226 --> 07:39.690
I DID MENTION THAT
HELEN'S DOING THE SNACKS, RIGHT?

07:39.690 --> 07:41.031
AH.

07:41.031 --> 07:44.865
I JUST FINISHED A BATCH
OF MACADAMIA NUT SCONES.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.036
WOULD YOU LIKE ONE?

07:46.036 --> 07:48.739
BLESS YOU, MY CHILD. (chuckles)

07:48.739 --> 07:50.771
AND MAYBE ONE FOR THE CAR?

07:54.204 --> 07:57.508
I GET SO NERVOUS EVERY TIME
I WALK INTO THIS CLASS.

07:57.508 --> 08:00.210
I MEAN, ANDRE ZELLER, RIGHT?

08:00.210 --> 08:02.152
BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

08:02.152 --> 08:03.714
HE DOESN'T THINK
I'M A SERIOUS ARTIST.

08:03.714 --> 08:06.587
BUT I'LL SHOW HIM.
I HAVE PAIN.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.088
I MEAN, LIKE THIS MORNING,

08:08.088 --> 08:10.160
MY 9-YEAR-OLD WALKED
RIGHT INTO SCHOOL

08:10.160 --> 08:12.162
WITHOUT EVEN SAYING GOOD-BYE.

08:12.162 --> 08:14.094
NO HUG, NO KISS.

08:14.094 --> 08:17.027
NOTHING. (sighs)

08:17.027 --> 08:21.231
WELL, I'M GONNA TAKE THAT MISERY
AND USE IT IN MY ART.

08:21.231 --> 08:24.705
I'M USING
MY FATHER'S SUICIDE.

08:25.876 --> 08:28.008
(door opens)

08:28.008 --> 08:30.781
TODAY WE'LL BE WORKING
WITH LIGHT AND SHADOW.

08:32.282 --> 08:34.615
OOH! EGGS. COOL.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.647
MS. DELFINO,
THIS IS MY BREAKFAST.

08:36.647 --> 08:38.649
(rips paper)

08:40.751 --> 08:42.623
YOU WILL NOT BE SKETCHING EGGS

08:42.623 --> 08:46.126
OR ANY OTHER
HACKNEYED STILL LIFES TODAY.

08:46.126 --> 08:49.129
YOU'LL BE DRAWING THE MALE FORM.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.831
EMILE.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.107
WHOA!

09:01.141 --> 09:03.714
SORRY.

09:03.714 --> 09:06.176
TAKES SOME... GETTING USED TO.

09:09.279 --> 09:11.281
(Andre) AS YOU BEGIN TO SKETCH,

09:11.281 --> 09:14.054
THINK OF THE HUMAN FORM
AS AN OBJECT.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.956
WHAT IS IT
THAT CATCHES YOUR EYE?

09:15.956 --> 09:18.288
(stifles laugh)

09:18.288 --> 09:22.092
(inhales sharply) MM.
DIDN'T MEAN IT. JUST POPPED OUT.

09:22.092 --> 09:23.563
I WANT YOU
TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION

09:23.563 --> 09:26.236
TO WHICH PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY
REFLECT LIGHT

09:26.236 --> 09:28.268
AND WHICH PARTS CAST A SHADOW.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.641
(stifles laugh)

09:30.641 --> 09:32.302
I'M SORRY, MS. DELFINO.

09:32.302 --> 09:35.005
I DIDN'T REALIZE
WE WERE IN JUNIOR HIGH.

09:35.005 --> 09:37.107
HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN A PENIS
BEFORE?

09:37.107 --> 09:39.209
NO. NO. YES, I HAVE.

09:39.209 --> 09:41.581
UH, LOTS. WELL, NOTLOTS.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.985
THE APPROPRIATE... AMOUNT.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.957
PLEASE TRY TO BE PROFESSIONAL.

09:46.957 --> 09:49.189
I AM. I AM PROFESSIONAL.

09:49.189 --> 09:52.292
PENIS, PENIS, PENIS.
(exhales deeply)

09:52.292 --> 09:54.695
JUST TRYING TO TAKE THE POWER
OUT OF IT.

10:00.030 --> 10:03.273
(stifling laugh)

10:03.273 --> 10:05.235
QUICK.
 (pats arm)

10:05.235 --> 10:07.778
TELL ME ABOUT
YOUR FATHER'S SUICIDE.

10:13.043 --> 10:14.945
(door opens)

10:14.945 --> 10:16.987
(sighs)
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:16.987 --> 10:18.849
UH... (sighs)

10:18.849 --> 10:21.191
I WAS, UH, LOOKING
FOR MY PHONE,

10:21.191 --> 10:23.053
AND, UH...

10:23.053 --> 10:25.756
I KNOW THIS IS GONNA SOUND
STUPID, BUT...

10:25.756 --> 10:28.699
I COULDN'T GO IN THERE.

10:28.699 --> 10:31.101
OH, GOD. I DON'T MEAN
TO SOUND INSENSITIVE,

10:31.101 --> 10:32.262
BUT IS THIS DEAD GUY ANGST?

10:32.262 --> 10:34.304
'CAUSE I AM REALLY POOPED
RIGHT NOW.

10:34.304 --> 10:37.267
IT'S JUST,EVERY TIME
 I GO INTO THAT ROOM,

10:37.267 --> 10:39.209
I THINK ABOUT THAT NIGHT.

10:39.209 --> 10:41.041
WELL, HERE'S AN IDEA.
DON'T GO IN THAT ROOM.

10:41.041 --> 10:44.644
LOOK, THERE'S THE KITCHEN.
NO ONE DIED IN THERE.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.677
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE'RE BOTH STRESSED.

10:46.677 --> 10:48.679
I'LL POUR US
A COUPLE OF DRINKS.

10:48.679 --> 10:51.181
NO, THANKS. I'VE BEEN HITTING
THAT STUFF PRETTY HARD LATELY.

10:51.181 --> 10:52.983
I DON'T WANT IT TO BECOME
A THING.
 (bottle clinks)

10:52.983 --> 10:55.255
WELL, AFTER THE DAY I HAD,
I'LL FINISH THE BOTTLE MYSELF.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.426
(cork pops)

10:56.426 --> 10:58.759
THIS P.T.A. GIG IS TURNING INTO
A SERIOUS PAIN IN THE ASS.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.290
(pours liquor)
 YEAH.

11:00.290 --> 11:02.432
I SHOW UP
THETEENSIESTBIT LATE,

11:02.432 --> 11:04.434
AND THE GIRLS ARE ALL OVER ME.

11:04.434 --> 11:05.966
THEY'RE LIKE,
"GABY, WHY ARE YOU LATE?

11:05.966 --> 11:09.169
YOU SHOULD BE SAD AND MISERABLE
AND ON TIME, JUST LIKE US."

11:09.169 --> 11:11.371
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE JEALOUS
OR SOMETHING.

11:12.943 --> 11:15.005
OH, MY GOD.

11:15.005 --> 11:16.907
THEY'REJEALOUS.

11:16.907 --> 11:19.780
I KNOW WHAT TO DO. (chuckles)
THANKS FOR LISTENING.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.111
(kisses)

11:23.784 --> 11:25.415
(sighs)

11:39.169 --> 11:40.370
IT'S NOTHING FANCY,
BUT, UH, I'M PROUD TO SAY

11:40.370 --> 11:42.973
WE FEED HUNDREDS
OF HOMELESS PEOPLE EVERY DAY.

11:42.973 --> 11:45.235
OH. WONDERFUL.

11:45.235 --> 11:47.107
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT
I'M LOOKING FOR.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.278
WELL, GREAT.

11:48.278 --> 11:50.781
BUT, UH,
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY...

11:50.781 --> 11:52.482
UH, WHAT DID YOU DO?

11:52.482 --> 11:54.184
EXCUSE ME?

11:54.184 --> 11:55.986
WELL, WHEN MOST PEOPLE
WANNA GIVE BACK,

11:55.986 --> 11:57.717
IT USUALLY MEANS
THEY'VE DONE SOMETHING

11:57.717 --> 11:59.289
THEY'RE, UH, ASHAMED OF.

11:59.289 --> 12:02.392
YOU KNOW, EMBEZZLEMENT,
ADULTERY.

12:02.392 --> 12:04.724
WHAT'S YOUR STORY?

12:04.724 --> 12:05.996
(chuckles)

12:05.996 --> 12:08.298
I SUPPOSE I COULD ASK YOU
THE SAME THING.

12:08.298 --> 12:10.130
AND I'D HAVE THE GOOD SENSE
NOT TO ANSWER.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.232
MM-HMM.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.363
I'VE JUST BEEN FEELING
DISCONNECTED LATELY,

12:13.363 --> 12:17.137
AND I THOUGHT BY DOING SOMETHING
MEANINGFUL WITH MY DAYS

12:17.137 --> 12:19.169
THAT I COULD CHANGE THAT.

12:19.169 --> 12:21.972
ACTUAL SELFLESSNESS.
THAT'S REFRESHING.

12:21.972 --> 12:24.174
I WISH THE CITY COUNCIL WAS
AS ENLIGHTENED AS YOU.

12:24.174 --> 12:25.515
OH?

12:25.515 --> 12:27.217
AH, THEY'RE HOLDING UP
ONE OF MY DEVELOPMENTS

12:27.217 --> 12:29.479
'CAUSE IT INCLUDES
LOW-INCOME HOUSING.

12:29.479 --> 12:32.182
AH. TYPICAL
"NOT IN MY BACKYARD" ATTITUDE.

12:32.182 --> 12:33.153
BY THE WAY...

12:33.153 --> 12:34.785
IT'S NOT IN YOUR BACKYARD.

12:34.785 --> 12:36.126
(cell phone rings)

12:36.126 --> 12:37.928
(exhales deeply)

12:37.928 --> 12:39.429
UH, I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE THIS.

12:39.429 --> 12:41.161
BUT, UH, I WILL LEAVE YOU
IN THE CAPABLE HANDS

12:41.161 --> 12:43.293
OF, UH, DONNIE HERE.

12:43.293 --> 12:45.235
EXCUSE ME. HELLO?

12:45.235 --> 12:46.366
WHO ARE YOU?

12:46.366 --> 12:49.239
OH, I AM BREE,
YOUR HUMBLE SOUS CHEF.

12:49.239 --> 12:53.073
WHAT DO YOU NEED ME TO DO?
PREP? SAUTE? CHOP?

12:53.073 --> 12:56.176
YOU WANNA PREP?

12:57.347 --> 13:00.150
START PREPPING.

13:00.150 --> 13:01.882
THAT'S... IT?

13:01.882 --> 13:04.254
OH, I FORGOT TO SHOW YOU
THE SPICE RACK.

13:04.254 --> 13:07.417
HERE YOU GO. SALT. PEPPER.

13:07.417 --> 13:09.019
AND WE'RE OUT OF PEPPER.

13:09.019 --> 13:10.560
IF I MAY,

13:10.560 --> 13:13.864
HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED
MAKING THE SOUP FROM SCRATCH?

13:13.864 --> 13:15.195
(scoffs) WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THAT.

13:15.195 --> 13:16.997
JUST GET 'EM IN
AND GET 'EM OUT.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.328
YES, BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW

13:18.328 --> 13:19.529
HOW PRESSED FOR TIME
THE HOMELESS ARE.

13:19.529 --> 13:21.972
LOOK, THESE PEOPLE
MAY NOT HAVE HOMES,

13:21.972 --> 13:23.473
BUT THEY DO HAVE TASTE BUDS.

13:23.473 --> 13:25.005
WOULD YOU BE OFFENDED

13:25.005 --> 13:28.038
IF I TRIED WHIPPING UP A BATCH
OF HOMEMADE SOUP?

13:28.038 --> 13:31.341
CAN YOU GET IT DONE BY NOON?

13:31.341 --> 13:34.284
OH, DEAR. I GUESS
I'LL HAVE TO KEEP IT SIMPLE.

13:34.284 --> 13:37.387
IT'S JUST A RUSTIC
ACORN SQUASH BISQUE

13:37.387 --> 13:39.349
FINISHED WITH A DOT
OF MAPLE-INFUSED CREME FRAICHE

13:39.349 --> 13:43.023
AND A LITTLE CRUMBLE
OF FRIED SAGE.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.197
HOLY CRAP!

13:47.197 --> 13:52.262
FINALLY, A BLURB
FOR MY NEXT COOKBOOK.

13:52.262 --> 13:54.234
I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF YOU
ARE UNCOMFORTABLE

13:54.234 --> 13:56.836
WITH THE NAKED BODY,
MAYBE EVEN FIND IT LAUGHABLE.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.168
MR. ZELLER, I'M SO SORRY.

13:58.168 --> 14:00.040
ONE CANNOT CREATE REAL ART

14:00.040 --> 14:02.542
IF ONE IS CRIPPLED
BY ONE'S OWN INHIBITIONS.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.374
I'M GONNA STRIP THEM AWAY.

14:04.374 --> 14:08.278
SO... FOR OUR NEXT CLASS, WE'RE
NOT GONNA HAVE NUDE MODELS.

14:08.278 --> 14:09.950
PHEW.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.151
WE'RE GONNA HAVE NUDE PAINTERS.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.852
WHAT?

14:12.852 --> 14:14.584
PAINTING IN THE NUDE
WILL FORCE YOU

14:14.584 --> 14:16.957
TO CREATE FROM A PLACE
OF TOTAL HONESTY.

14:16.957 --> 14:21.131
AND IF YOU'RE SERIOUS
ABOUT BEING AN ARTIST,

14:21.131 --> 14:22.933
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH IT.

14:24.194 --> 14:27.067
NOPE.
NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.402
(whimpers)

14:35.075 --> 14:36.876
WHAT'S GOING ON, GABY?

14:36.876 --> 14:39.149
YEAH. WHY'D YOU
CALL US HERE?

14:39.149 --> 14:41.111
I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE

14:41.111 --> 14:43.313
FOR WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE LAST MEETING.

14:43.313 --> 14:45.115
KEEP TALKIN'.

14:45.115 --> 14:47.387
IT WAS WRONG OF ME TO BLOW
YOU OFF FOR A SPA APPOINTMENT

14:47.387 --> 14:49.389
WHEN YOU HAVE SUCH BUSY LIVES.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.461
MESSAGE RECEIVED,
LOUD AND CLEAR.

14:51.461 --> 14:52.993
THANK YOU.

14:52.993 --> 14:56.396
SO TO SHOW YOU I'VE TAKEN
YOUR COMPLAINT TO HEART,

14:56.396 --> 15:00.570
MAY I PRESENT MY BEAUTY TEAM!

15:00.570 --> 15:03.233
ARMANDO,
THE BEST MASSEUSE IN TOWN,

15:03.233 --> 15:04.574
KAY, MY HAIRDRESSER,

15:04.574 --> 15:06.176
AND PING ON NAILS.

15:06.176 --> 15:10.040
YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO BE JEALOUS
OFMYFABULOUS LIFE.

15:10.040 --> 15:14.284
FOR ONE DAY, YOU CAN BE ME.
MY TREAT. GO CRAZY.

15:14.284 --> 15:17.247
WOW. GOOD TO KNOW
YOU GOT OUR MESSAGE.

15:17.247 --> 15:19.389
YOU'RE WELCOME. (chuckles)

15:19.389 --> 15:22.322
SO YOU THINK YOU MIGHT WANT
TO RECONSIDER DOING THE FOOD?

15:22.322 --> 15:23.393
I'D LOVE TO.

15:23.393 --> 15:26.126
(chuckles)
 UH, I'LL HANDLE DECORATIONS.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.257
YEAH, WHATEVER YOU NEED
FROM US.

15:27.257 --> 15:28.598
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

15:28.598 --> 15:30.300
NOW TODAY, RELAX.

15:30.300 --> 15:33.933
TAKE A BREAK FROM
GROCERY SHOPPING AND SPANKING.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.236
I HAVE TO GO MEET
MY TRAVEL AGENT.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.710
ARE YOU GUYS SERIOUS?
ARE WE REALLY HELPING HER?

15:40.710 --> 15:44.474
NO. WE'RE HELPING OURSELVES
TO A FREE SPA DAY,

15:44.474 --> 15:48.378
THEN WE'RE GOING TO LEAVE HER
TWISTING IN THE WIND.

15:48.378 --> 15:49.719
OH! HEY, LADIES,

15:49.719 --> 15:52.482
ANYONE KNOW OF A GOOD HOTEL
IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE?

15:53.953 --> 15:56.386
(chuckles) I'M SORRY.
I DID IT AGAIN!

15:56.386 --> 15:59.459
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
(laughing)

15:59.459 --> 16:00.530
(door closes)

16:00.530 --> 16:03.033
HEY, LYNETTE,

16:03.033 --> 16:05.495
DID I LEAVE
THOSE FABRIC SAMPLES?

16:05.495 --> 16:07.597
(gasps) BUSTED!

16:07.597 --> 16:10.540
THAT IS A PORN SLAM
IF I'VE EVER SEEN ONE.

16:10.540 --> 16:11.971
(mouth full) PORN?
 MM.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.403
NO.
I WAS CHECKING MY E-MAIL.

16:13.403 --> 16:17.247
(scoffs) COME ON. IT'S OKAY.
WE ALL LOOK AT PORN.

16:17.247 --> 16:18.548
WHAT ARE YOU INTO?

16:18.548 --> 16:22.312
STRAIGHT, BI, SOLO,
BALD GUYS,

16:22.312 --> 16:25.055
FUZZY WHISPERS,
CINNAMON CAKES,

16:25.055 --> 16:26.416
POODLING?

16:26.416 --> 16:28.288
DO I HAVE TO LEARN
WHAT THOSE ARE?

16:28.288 --> 16:30.290
'CAUSE IREALLY
 DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

16:30.290 --> 16:33.663
OH, COME ON. LET ME SEE.
I PROMISE I WILL NOT JUDGE.

16:33.663 --> 16:36.296
NO. I SIGNED UP
FOR AN ONLINE DATING SERVICE,

16:36.296 --> 16:39.369
AND I TOOK A STAB
AT MY INTRODUCTION VIDEO.

16:39.369 --> 16:40.400
(taps key)

16:40.400 --> 16:42.172
HI, I'M LYNETTE.

16:42.172 --> 16:44.304
I'M 35 TO 45-ISH.

16:44.304 --> 16:46.506
I'M A CANCER,
AND I BEAT CANCER.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.409
COINCIDENCE OR NOT? YOU DECIDE.
(chuckles nervously)

16:49.409 --> 16:52.142
THATIS MORE DISTURBING

16:52.142 --> 16:54.144
THAN ANY PORN
I'VE EVER SEEN.

16:54.144 --> 16:55.645
YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T JUDGE.

16:55.645 --> 16:58.418
OH! ONLINE DATING SUCKS.

16:58.418 --> 17:01.121
IT'S FULL OF GUYS WHO PHOTOSHOP
HAIR ON THEIR HEADS

17:01.121 --> 17:03.793
AND CROP OUT THEIR MAN BOOBS.

17:03.793 --> 17:06.796
YOU WANT TO MEET MEN?
I'M TAKING YOU TO A BAR.

17:06.796 --> 17:09.059
A BAR? OH, I DON'T KNOW.

17:09.059 --> 17:12.502
IT'S BEEN 25 YEARS SINCE
I TRIED TO PICK UP A GUY.

17:12.502 --> 17:16.236
WELL, WITH ME AS YOUR WINGWOMAN,
YOU CAN HAVE ANY MAN YOU WANT.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.567
FRIDAY OKAY?

17:17.567 --> 17:19.469
I THOUGHT YOU HAD A DATE
WITH BEN.

17:19.469 --> 17:22.271
MM. HE CANCELED.AGAIN.

17:22.271 --> 17:25.244
SOME STUPID REAL ESTATE
DEVELOPMENT FOR THE POOR.

17:25.244 --> 17:26.316
BASTARD.

17:26.316 --> 17:27.777
(sighs) WELL, HIS LOSS.

17:27.777 --> 17:29.579
IF HE DOESN'T APPRECIATE
WHAT HE'S GOT,

17:29.579 --> 17:31.581
I WILL FIND SOMEONE
WHO DOES.

17:31.581 --> 17:34.224
OH, AND LAY OFF
THE ICE CREAM.

17:34.224 --> 17:36.256
THERE'S NO PHOTOSHOP
IN REAL LIFE.

17:47.397 --> 17:50.540
MORNING.
WHAT'S FOR BREAKFAST?

17:50.540 --> 17:54.344
EGGS. I WAS GONNA MAKE BACON,
BUT IT SEEMED A LITTLE RISKY.

17:55.575 --> 17:59.779
SUSAN, YOU GET UPSET IF I TAKE
MY SOCKS OFF IN THE KITCHEN.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.482
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:02.482 --> 18:06.516
ANDRE FEELS "UNTIL WE SHED
OUR INHIBITIONS,

18:06.516 --> 18:09.489
OUR ART WILL BE
ONLY SUPERFICIAL."

18:09.489 --> 18:11.521
ANYWAY,

18:11.521 --> 18:16.166
FOR OUR NEXT CLASS,
WE HAVE TO PAINT IN THE NUDE.

18:16.166 --> 18:19.529
SO I'M TRYING
TO GET USED TO IT.

18:19.529 --> 18:22.602
AND I WANT TO PROVE TO HIM
THAT I CAN BE A REAL ARTIST.

18:22.602 --> 18:26.676
(chuckles)
WOW, THAT GUY ISGOOD.

18:26.676 --> 18:30.109
HE GETS TO SEE A BUNCH OF COEDS
NAKED AND CALL IT WORK.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.782
(laughs)

18:32.782 --> 18:35.545
OH, HONEY, I'M KIDDING.

18:35.545 --> 18:38.117
NO, I CAN'T DO IT.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.150
I'M NOT A NAKED PERSON.

18:41.391 --> 18:43.693
MAYBE I'M NOT A REAL ARTIST
EITHER.

18:43.693 --> 18:45.755
SUSAN.
 (mouth full) NO, I MEAN IT.

18:45.755 --> 18:48.328
ANDRE DOESN'T LIKE
ANY OF MY WORK.

18:48.328 --> 18:52.702
I'M NOT SERIOUS
LIKE THE OTHER STUDENTS.

18:52.702 --> 18:54.704
I THINK I'M JUST GONNA QUIT
THE CLASS.

18:54.704 --> 18:58.438
QUIT? BUT THIS CLASS HAS BEEN
REALLY GOOD FOR YOU.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.440
IT SEEMS LIKE
IT WAS PULLING YOU

19:00.440 --> 19:02.412
OUT OF THAT DARK PLACE
YOU'VE BEEN IN.

19:02.412 --> 19:03.673
YOU THINK SO?

19:03.673 --> 19:07.547
YEAH, AND I FEEL LIKE
I'M GETTING MY OLD SUSIE BACK.

19:07.547 --> 19:10.450
BESIDES, THIS GUY
SOUNDS LIKE A JACKASS.

19:10.450 --> 19:11.551
DON'T LET HIM WIN.

19:11.551 --> 19:14.724
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:14.724 --> 19:17.387
IAMA SERIOUS ARTIST.

19:17.387 --> 19:19.929
I JUST NEED TO GET USED TO
PEOPLE SEEING ME NAKED.

19:19.929 --> 19:22.792
(knock on door)
 (Lee) SUSAN!
IT'S LEE. YOU HOME?

19:22.792 --> 19:26.436
PERFECT. MY BEST GAY.

19:26.436 --> 19:29.269
WHO BETTER TO PRACTICE ON?

19:29.269 --> 19:31.471
GOOD MORNING, LEE.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.343
THIS IS BOB'S--MOTHER OF GOD!

19:33.343 --> 19:34.744
OHH!

19:34.744 --> 19:36.806
(laughs)

19:38.608 --> 19:41.681
GAY MARRIAGE DOESN'T SEEM
SO FREAKY NOW, DOES IT?

19:43.413 --> 19:45.655
(indistinct conversations)

19:45.655 --> 19:48.788
LOOKS LIKE MY TUSCAN BEAN WITH
PARMESAN CROSTINI IS A HIT.

19:48.788 --> 19:51.761
YEAH, IT IS,
BUT I THINK YOU'RE STARTING

19:51.761 --> 19:54.864
TO ATTRACT
THE WRONG SORT OF CROWD.

19:57.327 --> 20:01.801
EXCUSE ME, BUT, UH, YOU DON'T
EXACTLY LOOK HOMELESS TO ME.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.274
YEAH, I-I'M HOMELESS.

20:04.274 --> 20:07.377
AND YET YOU HAVE
A $2,000 LAPTOP?

20:07.377 --> 20:09.739
BUT I LIVE IN THE BOX
IT CAME IN?

20:09.739 --> 20:11.741
OKAY, I-I'M A COLLEGE STUDENT.

20:11.741 --> 20:13.913
BUT MY PARENTS
DID STOP TALKING TO ME

20:13.913 --> 20:16.986
WHEN I SWITCHED FROM PRE-MED
TO CREATIVE WRITING.

20:16.986 --> 20:18.918
WELL, I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEAVE.

20:18.918 --> 20:23.253
TOO BAD. I JUST GAVE YOU
MAD PROPS ON MY BLOG.

20:23.253 --> 20:24.394
IS THAT A GOOD THING?

20:24.394 --> 20:27.297
YEAH.

20:27.297 --> 20:28.628
"HOMEY BUT REFINED,

20:28.628 --> 20:30.400
"BREE VAN DE CAMP'S
TUSCAN BEAN SOUP

20:30.400 --> 20:33.733
IS A REVELATION IN A BOWL."

20:33.733 --> 20:35.365
REVELATION, YOU SAY?

20:35.365 --> 20:37.737
UH-HUH. AND IT'S ALREADY
BEEN "LIKED" ON FACEBOOK

20:37.737 --> 20:40.810
AND RETWEETED 200 TIMES...

20:40.810 --> 20:42.772
WHICH IS ALSO A GOOD THING.

20:42.772 --> 20:43.743
OH.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.645
BUT HEY, IF I GOTTA GO...

20:45.645 --> 20:46.916
HOLD ON.

20:46.916 --> 20:50.680
I CAN'T LET A TALENTED
NEAR-ORPHAN LIKE YOU GO HUNGRY.

20:50.680 --> 20:52.682
LET ME GET YOU A REFILL.

20:52.682 --> 20:57.026
OH, AND IT'S "VAN DE KAMP"...
(whispers) WITH A "K."

21:00.860 --> 21:03.763
HEY, MIKE. NEED A HAND?

21:05.395 --> 21:06.696
NO, I'M OKAY.

21:06.696 --> 21:08.668
(thud)

21:08.668 --> 21:10.269
UH, SUSAN AROUND?

21:10.269 --> 21:13.473
UH, SHE'S
AT HER PAINTING CLASS.

21:13.473 --> 21:14.674
OKAY.

21:14.674 --> 21:17.276
I'LL... STOP BY LATER.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.849
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

21:22.882 --> 21:25.014
YOU NEED TO SAY
SOMETHING TO ME, MIKE?

21:25.014 --> 21:26.816
YEAH, I DO.

21:26.816 --> 21:28.458
IF THINGS WERE DIFFERENT,

21:28.458 --> 21:30.460
IF IT HAD BEEN ME
THAT KILLED SOMEBODY,

21:30.460 --> 21:31.891
AND YOUR WIFE WALKED IN,

21:31.891 --> 21:33.893
I'D HAVE GONE TO THE COPS
AND TURNED MYSELF IN.

21:33.893 --> 21:36.526
I WOULDN'T HAVE
DRAGGED GABY INTO IT.

21:36.526 --> 21:39.469
THERE'S A LOT I WOULD'VE DONE
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT THAT NIGHT

21:39.469 --> 21:40.870
IF I COULD.

21:40.870 --> 21:42.672
YEAH, WELL, YOU CAN'T.

21:42.672 --> 21:46.606
BUT HERE'S WHAT YOUCANDO--
YOU CAN LEAVE SUSAN ALONE.

21:46.606 --> 21:50.640
JUST LET HER FIND A WAY TO DEAL
WITH WHAT YOU PUT HER THROUGH.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.443
IT JUST REALLY HELPS

21:53.443 --> 21:54.844
TO TALK TO HER.

21:57.647 --> 22:00.790
BUT IT DOESN'T HELP HER.

22:02.752 --> 22:04.454
THEN...

22:04.454 --> 22:06.656
I WON'T DO IT ANYMORE.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.530
YEAH.

22:22.111 --> 22:23.973
(sighs)

22:27.377 --> 22:29.719
(Andre) REMEMBER,
TECHNIQUE IS A CRUTCH.

22:29.719 --> 22:31.020
LEARN IT AND THROW IT AWAY.

22:31.020 --> 22:33.723
THAT WAY YOU CAN BEGIN
TO FIND YOUR OWN VOICE

22:33.723 --> 22:35.525
AND THAT'S WHAT THAT...

22:39.929 --> 22:43.933
(students murmur)

22:43.933 --> 22:45.835
OH, MY GOD.

22:45.835 --> 22:47.597
OH!

22:49.038 --> 22:51.771
TAKING CASUAL FRIDAY
A BIT TO THE EXTREME,

22:51.771 --> 22:54.043
AREN'T WE, MS. DELFINO?

22:54.043 --> 22:56.446
ISN'T THIS THE DAY WE WERE...

22:56.446 --> 22:57.847
AREN'T WE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE...

22:57.847 --> 23:01.110
THE SCHOOL PUT THE KIBOSH ON
MY LITTLE ARTISTIC EXPERIMENT.

23:01.110 --> 23:02.912
IT WAS ALL THERE
IN THE E-MAIL.

23:02.912 --> 23:04.383
WHAT E-MAIL?

23:04.383 --> 23:06.416
THE ONE
YOU OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T OPEN.

23:06.416 --> 23:09.689
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T SEND ME ONE.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.691
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

23:11.691 --> 23:13.062
TO HUMILIATE ME.

23:13.062 --> 23:15.925
TO PUNISH ME FOR LAUGHING.

23:15.925 --> 23:20.730
YOU HAVE SINGLED ME OUT
SINCE DAY ONE.

23:20.730 --> 23:23.132
WHY NOT TRY
TO MAKE A FOOL OF ME?

23:25.775 --> 23:28.638
BECAUSE IN THE VAST LANDSCAPE
OF MY INTERIOR LIFE,

23:28.638 --> 23:31.811
YOU'RE MERELY A DUST SPECK.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.883
NOW GET DRESSED AND SIT DOWN.

23:33.883 --> 23:36.586
NO.

23:36.586 --> 23:39.989
I SIGNED UP FOR THIS CLASS
TO LEARN SOMETHING,

23:39.989 --> 23:42.722
NOT TO BE A PUNCHING BAG

23:42.722 --> 23:44.754
FOR AN EGOMANIAC

23:44.754 --> 23:46.896
WITH A PAINTBRUSH!

23:46.896 --> 23:48.828
I QUIT!

24:04.013 --> 24:06.045
(thud)

24:06.045 --> 24:09.048
HELLO AND WELCOME
TO OUR SOUP KITCHEN.

24:09.048 --> 24:10.980
I HOPE YOU'RE HUNGRY,
BECAUSE I HAVE PREPARED

24:10.980 --> 24:13.523
A HEARTY ITALIAN WEDDING SOUP
TODAY.

24:13.523 --> 24:16.155
DONNIE, TWO.

24:17.857 --> 24:20.960
(indistinct conversations)

24:22.592 --> 24:25.495
REVEREND SYKES.
WHAT A NICE SURPRISE!

24:25.495 --> 24:27.066
THAT'S QUITE A CROWD
OUT FRONT.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.998
I PRACTICALLY
HAD TO FIGHT MY WAY IN.

24:28.998 --> 24:30.870
WELL, EVER SINCE
I TOOK OVER THE KITCHEN,

24:30.870 --> 24:31.901
WE'VE BEEN JAM-PACKED.

24:31.901 --> 24:34.774
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR SUGGESTING I GET INVOLVED.

24:34.774 --> 24:39.609
I HAVE NEVER FELT MORE NEEDED
OR IMPORTANT IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

24:39.609 --> 24:43.212
THE INTENTION OF CHARITY IS NOT
TO MAKE US FEEL IMPORTANT.

24:43.212 --> 24:45.114
OF COURSE NOT.
IT'S TO HELP PEOPLE.

24:45.114 --> 24:47.016
FEELING IMPORTANT'S
JUST A BONUS.

24:47.016 --> 24:48.057
(chuckles)

24:48.057 --> 24:49.759
SO WHAT BRINGS YOU BY?

24:49.759 --> 24:51.961
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD TELL ME

24:51.961 --> 24:55.094
WHERE A HOMELESS PERSON
COULD GET A HOT MEAL.

24:55.094 --> 24:58.027
WELL, RIGHT HERE, OF COURSE.

24:58.027 --> 25:00.099
NO, BREE.

25:00.099 --> 25:02.001
EVER SINCE YOU'VE TURNED
THIS SOUP KITCHEN

25:02.001 --> 25:03.272
INTO A BISQUE KITCHEN,

25:03.272 --> 25:05.535
THE HOMELESS DON'T
FEEL COMFORTABLE HERE.

25:05.535 --> 25:08.938
WHY? I WAS JUST TRYING
TO MAKE THIS PLACE SPECIAL.

25:08.938 --> 25:12.281
IT WAS ALREADY SPECIAL.
IT WAS HOME FOR THEM,

25:12.281 --> 25:14.984
UNTILYOUTOOK THAT AWAY.

25:18.588 --> 25:20.890
(sighs)

25:20.890 --> 25:24.123
(indistinct conversations)

25:26.926 --> 25:28.598
EXCUSE ME.

25:32.301 --> 25:35.064
I'M SORRY, BUT YOU'RE
GONNA NEED TO LEAVE.

25:35.064 --> 25:36.265
HEY, WE'RE STILL EATING.

25:36.265 --> 25:38.638
WELL, THEN GO EAT
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.740
YOU CERTAINLY LOOK LIKE
YOU CAN AFFORD TO.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.912
WHOA. WHERE'S THE ATTITUDE
COMING FROM?

25:42.912 --> 25:44.744
WE MADE THIS PLACE A SUCCESS.

25:44.744 --> 25:48.017
NO. THIS PLACE IS SUPPOSED
TO FEED HOMELESS PEOPLE.

25:48.017 --> 25:49.949
IT'S A DISMAL FAILURE.

25:51.651 --> 25:54.023
THIS FOOD ISN'T FOR YOU. IT'S
FOR THE HUNGRY AND THE POOR--

25:54.023 --> 25:57.086
THE PEOPLE WE WALK PAST
EVERY DAY.

25:57.086 --> 25:59.088
EVERYONE DESERVES
TO HAVE A PLACE,

25:59.088 --> 26:02.091
AND THIS PLACE WAS THEIRS
UNTIL I MADE IT MINE.

26:02.091 --> 26:07.096
SO PLEASE, PACK UP YOUR LAPTOPS
AND YOUR SMARTPHONES AND GO.

26:07.096 --> 26:09.168
PLEASE GO.

26:14.303 --> 26:17.607
BEN, I'M SORRY. I HAVE MADE
A TERRIBLE MESS OF THINGS.

26:17.607 --> 26:19.048
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

26:19.048 --> 26:22.281
YOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE A SPEECH
THAT GOOD AGAIN TOMORROW?

26:22.281 --> 26:24.153
SPEECH?

26:24.153 --> 26:27.016
YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME PUSH
THAT LOW-INCOME HOUSING PROJECT

26:27.016 --> 26:28.958
THROUGH CITY COUNCIL.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.061
(knock on door)

26:36.165 --> 26:38.868
THIS IS WHERE YOU LIVE, HUH?

26:38.868 --> 26:40.930
NORMAN ROCKWELL WOULD
WALK DOWN THIS STREET

26:40.930 --> 26:43.072
AND SAY, "A LITTLE MUCH."

26:43.072 --> 26:44.303
(chuckles)

26:44.303 --> 26:46.005
CAN I COME IN?

26:46.005 --> 26:47.276
OF COURSE. HOW ELSE ARE
YOU GONNA MAKE FUN

26:47.276 --> 26:49.178
OF THE INSIDE OF MY HOUSE?

26:49.178 --> 26:52.081
BY THE WAY, I, UH,
CHECKED MY E-MAIL,

26:52.081 --> 26:54.914
AND, UH, YOU NEVER SENT ME ONE.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.916
DID YOU CHECK
YOUR CAMPUS E-MAIL?

26:56.916 --> 26:59.789
I HAVE A CAMPUS E-MAIL?

26:59.789 --> 27:01.751
OKAY,
I'M GONNA MAKE THIS BRIEF,

27:01.751 --> 27:03.953
MAINLY BECAUSE I'VE GOT
A DINNER ENGAGEMENT

27:03.953 --> 27:06.856
WITH SOMEONE INFINITELY
MORE INTERESTING THAN YOU.

27:06.856 --> 27:08.227
(sighs) WOW.

27:08.227 --> 27:10.830
CLIMB DOWN FROM YOUR CROSS
AND COME BACK TO MY CLASS.

27:10.830 --> 27:14.033
WHY?
SO YOU CAN ABUSE ME MORE?

27:14.033 --> 27:16.906
YES, I WILL ABUSE YOU
AND SCREAM AT YOU,

27:16.906 --> 27:19.038
MAKE YOU PAINT IN THE NUDE
AND DO ANYTHING ELSE

27:19.038 --> 27:21.911
I HAVE TO DO TO GET YOU
TO STOP BEING SO SCARED.

27:21.911 --> 27:23.272
I'M NOT SCARED.

27:23.272 --> 27:26.946
I SHOWED UP
AT YOUR CLASS NAKED. (chuckles)

27:26.946 --> 27:29.048
THEN YOU RAN AWAY.

27:29.048 --> 27:31.751
IT SEEMS TO ME YOU DO
A LOT OF RUNNING AWAY

27:31.751 --> 27:33.853
AND NERVOUS GIGGLING.

27:33.853 --> 27:34.984
MM.

27:34.984 --> 27:38.027
YOU ACT LIKE
SOMEONE WHO'S...

27:39.128 --> 27:40.229
WHAT?

27:40.229 --> 27:43.062
YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING,

27:43.062 --> 27:45.034
AND I'M GONNA PULL IT
OUT OF YOU,

27:45.034 --> 27:47.937
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS,
THERE IS A CHANCE--

27:47.937 --> 27:51.370
THE REMOTEST, SLIMMEST WISP
OF A CHANCE--

27:51.370 --> 27:54.073
THAT YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY
BECOME AN ARTIST.

27:54.073 --> 27:57.076
OH, GOD. IS THIS THE PART
WHERE YOU TELL ME

27:57.076 --> 27:59.809
THAT THE REASON
YOU'RE BEING SO HARD ON ME

27:59.809 --> 28:03.983
IS BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE
IN THE CLASS WITH POTENTIAL?

28:03.983 --> 28:05.755
NO.

28:05.755 --> 28:09.258
AMY YAMATA'S THE ONLY ONE
IN THE CLASS WITH POTENTIAL.

28:09.258 --> 28:13.322
YOU'RE A BIZARRE CAR CRASH
THAT SOMEHOW FASCINATES ME.

28:13.322 --> 28:15.765
THANK YOU?

28:15.765 --> 28:17.226
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

28:17.226 --> 28:18.998
THIS IS ABOUT
AS LONG AS I CAN SPEND

28:18.998 --> 28:21.400
IN A ROOM DECORATED
WITH CERAMIC ELEPHANTS.

28:25.234 --> 28:29.008
(door opens and closes)

28:35.014 --> 28:38.888
HI, LADIES. SOMEONE WANNA
HELP ME WITH THESE FLOWERS?

28:38.888 --> 28:42.291
OKAY, NO WORRIES. I GOT IT.

28:44.754 --> 28:45.995
(sighs)

28:50.800 --> 28:52.832
WHAT HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN DOING?

28:52.832 --> 28:54.864
PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE HERE IN TWO
HOURS. NOTHING'S BEEN SET UP.

28:54.864 --> 28:58.407
WELL, I'M JUST SO RELAXED
FROM THAT MASSAGE.

28:58.407 --> 29:01.040
I'D HATE TO LIFT SOMETHING
AND TENSE UP AGAIN.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.212
YEAH, AND--AND PING WORKED
SO HARD ON THESE NAILS.

29:03.212 --> 29:06.045
I WOULD HATE TO CHIP THEM.

29:06.045 --> 29:08.778
AND I... CAN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING WITTY TO SAY

29:08.778 --> 29:12.952
ABOUT MY FABULOUS NEW 'DO,
BUT I'M NOT DOING SQUAT EITHER.

29:12.952 --> 29:15.254
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?

29:15.254 --> 29:17.857
I WENT OUT OF MY WAY
TO HELP YOU PEOPLE.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.859
OH, MY GOD,
YOU ARE SO OUT OF TOUCH.

29:19.859 --> 29:21.961
DO YOU REALLY THINK
A HOT STONE MASSAGE

29:21.961 --> 29:23.492
IS GONNA SOLVE MY PROBLEMS?

29:23.492 --> 29:27.166
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE KINDS
OF THINGS REAL PEOPLE DEAL WITH.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.168
YOU LIVE IN THIS PERFECT
LITTLE FAIRY TALE.

29:29.168 --> 29:31.300
FINE. I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.

29:31.300 --> 29:34.343
I HAVE TWO HOURS
AND A VERY CAPABLE HUSBAND.

29:34.343 --> 29:37.506
THIS EVENT IS GOING OFF
WITHOUT A HITCH.
 (beep)

29:37.506 --> 29:40.149
OH, AND ONE MORE THING.

29:40.149 --> 29:42.281
(gasps)

29:43.552 --> 29:44.984
(Carlos) Hello?

29:44.984 --> 29:46.555
HONEY, SORRY TO BOTHER YOU
AT WORK,

29:46.555 --> 29:48.057
BUT THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

29:48.057 --> 29:49.518
Whoa. What's going on?

29:49.518 --> 29:51.090
I NEED YOU TO MEET ME
AT THE SCHOOL.

29:51.090 --> 29:52.822
(loudly)
THESE P.T.A. BEEYOTCHES--

29:52.822 --> 29:54.193
YEAH, I'M TALKING TO YOU,
CINDY...

29:54.193 --> 29:56.265
(normal voice)
ARE REFUSING TO HELP ME.

29:56.265 --> 29:57.927
I NEED AN EXTRA PAIR OF HANDS.

29:57.927 --> 30:00.399
SURE.
I'LL BE--BE RIGHT THERE.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.902
HA! HE'S ON HIS WAY.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.804
THANKS. YOU'RE A LIFESAVER.
 (beep)

30:12.811 --> 30:13.943
(exhales deeply)

30:20.119 --> 30:21.891
(exhales deeply)

30:21.891 --> 30:24.894
(dance music playing)

30:24.894 --> 30:26.025
(indistinct conversations)

30:26.025 --> 30:28.557
WOW. WHEN I PICTURED THIS
IN MY HEAD,

30:28.557 --> 30:31.000
I WASN'T AS OLD
AS ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE...

30:31.000 --> 30:32.301
COMBINED.

30:32.301 --> 30:35.104
UH, TWO MARTINIS, DIRTY.

30:35.104 --> 30:37.907
OH, WAIT. THAT'S ME.

30:37.907 --> 30:39.268
(chuckles)

30:39.268 --> 30:41.340
FEEL FREE TO USE THAT
IF YOU WANT.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.943
MAYBE I WILL... AT HOME,
'CAUSE THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.574
OH, RELAX.

30:45.574 --> 30:47.376
LOOK AT THIS PLACE
LIKE A CANDY STORE.

30:47.376 --> 30:49.919
YOU JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT YOU'RE IN THE MOOD FOR.

30:49.919 --> 30:52.621
OBVIOUSLY,
SOMETHING WITH NUTS.

30:52.621 --> 30:54.884
I THOUGHT
I WAS DONE WITH THIS.

30:54.884 --> 30:58.357
I DATED, I COMBED THROUGH
ALL THE LOSERS,

30:58.357 --> 31:00.859
AND I FINALLY FOUND A GUY,

31:00.859 --> 31:03.162
SOMEONE WHO WAS SMART
AND MADE ME LAUGH.

31:03.162 --> 31:06.095
AND NOW TO BE BACK HERE,
AT MY AGE,

31:06.095 --> 31:10.069
DOING IT ALL OVER AGAIN,
IT'S DEPRESSING.

31:12.501 --> 31:14.373
OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE RIGHT.

31:14.373 --> 31:16.145
WHAT?

31:16.145 --> 31:18.407
ITISDEPRESSING.
 RENEE.

31:18.407 --> 31:20.079
WHAT AM I DOING
IN HELL'S CANDY STORE?

31:20.079 --> 31:23.312
I HAVE A GUY. HE'S SMART
AND HE MAKES ME LAUGH.

31:23.312 --> 31:25.484
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
BEN WORKS TOO MUCH.

31:25.484 --> 31:28.958
OH, HE'S PASSIONATE
ABOUT HIS JOB, BUT HE'S A 10.

31:28.958 --> 31:32.361
YOU ADD UP EVERY GUY
IN THIS PLACE AND YOU GET A 6.

31:35.894 --> 31:39.999
BUT YOU STAY. THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOMEBODY HERE FOR YOU.

31:44.103 --> 31:46.005
ORANGE CABLE...

31:46.005 --> 31:49.908
GOES AROUND HERE...

31:49.908 --> 31:51.640
THIS ONE GOES HERE.

31:51.640 --> 31:54.083
HA! AND...
(singsongy) PRESTO!

31:54.083 --> 31:55.985
(microphone feedback whining)
 OH!

31:55.985 --> 31:57.046
(gasps)

31:57.046 --> 31:58.217
OW.

31:58.217 --> 32:01.450
SO IS "PRESTO" SPANISH
FOR "COVER YOUR EARS"?

32:01.450 --> 32:03.322
(women laugh)

32:03.322 --> 32:04.954
THAT'S HILARIOUS, CINDY.

32:04.954 --> 32:05.995
YOU KNOW,
YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN A COMIC

32:05.995 --> 32:08.027
INSTEAD OF A PINT-SIZED
PAIN IN MY ASS!

32:08.027 --> 32:10.299
OH, IT'S GETTING LATE.

32:10.299 --> 32:12.131
LOOKS LIKE
YOUR PERFECT HUSBAND

32:12.131 --> 32:15.104
ISN'T GONNA BE HERE
TO BAIL YOU OUT.

32:15.104 --> 32:18.067
(clatter)

32:18.067 --> 32:21.470
AHA! LOOK WHO'S HERE.

32:21.470 --> 32:23.342
THERE'S MY HERO!

32:23.342 --> 32:25.174
NOW HURRY UP.
WE NEED TO GET CRACKING HERE.

32:25.174 --> 32:28.717
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32:28.717 --> 32:30.119
(chairs clatter)

32:30.119 --> 32:31.280
(grunts)

32:31.280 --> 32:34.023
CARLOS.

32:34.023 --> 32:35.384
(grunts)

32:35.384 --> 32:36.525
HEY, GABY.

32:36.525 --> 32:39.188
(pants)

32:39.188 --> 32:42.091
(whispers) CARLOS, YOU CAN'T BE
HERE LIKE THIS. YOU'VE GOTTA GO.

32:42.091 --> 32:43.732
NO, NO, NO.
GONNA HELP, OKAY?

32:43.732 --> 32:46.235
NO. PLEASE.
YOU NEED TO LEAVE.

32:46.235 --> 32:48.097
NO, I'M GONNA HELP, OKAY?
GONNA HELP.

32:48.097 --> 32:50.169
NO, HONEY.
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE, PLEASE.

32:50.169 --> 32:52.341
HANG ON. HANG ON.
(sniffs)

32:52.341 --> 32:53.742
WHEW!

33:04.113 --> 33:06.755
RACHEL, GET THE SOUNDBOARD
SET UP.

33:06.755 --> 33:10.619
MELISSA, MEGAN,
START PUTTING OUT THE FOOD.

33:10.619 --> 33:12.591
MELISSA, NOW.

33:16.325 --> 33:18.067
IT'S OKAY, GABY.

33:18.067 --> 33:20.529
WE GOT IT.

33:20.529 --> 33:24.033
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

33:24.033 --> 33:27.206
JUST TAKE CARE
OF YOUR HUSBAND.

33:31.210 --> 33:33.642
HELLO.

33:33.642 --> 33:36.185
I'M PHIL,
AND YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

33:36.185 --> 33:38.387
YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT.

33:38.387 --> 33:40.089
BUT I'LL TAKE IT.

33:40.089 --> 33:42.691
GOD KNOWS IT TOOK ME LONG ENOUGH
TO GET READY TONIGHT.

33:42.691 --> 33:44.793
I EVEN HAD TO PAY THE SITTER
TO COME EARLY.

33:44.793 --> 33:47.226
SITTER? SO YOU HAVE KIDS?

33:47.226 --> 33:48.397
YEAH.

33:48.397 --> 33:50.759
FIVE. FIVE KIDS.

33:50.759 --> 33:53.162
WOW. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT.

33:53.162 --> 33:55.364
I ACTUALLY HAVE A HUSBAND, TOO,
BUT WE'RE SEPARATED,

33:55.364 --> 33:58.036
AND WE'RE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE.
OR HE IS, AND I'M TRYING TO.

33:58.036 --> 34:00.109
NOT THAT I'M DOING IT
TO RETALIATE, IT'S JUST THAT--

34:00.109 --> 34:02.311
WOW. I CAN'T SEEM
TO STOP TALKING.

34:02.311 --> 34:05.174
MAYBE YOU COULD
SAY SOMETHING NOW.

34:05.174 --> 34:06.575
BYE.

34:08.117 --> 34:10.179
BYE-BYE.

34:14.553 --> 34:17.726
CROWD'S A LITTLELIGHTTONIGHT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

34:19.428 --> 34:22.690
CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK
OR ARE YOU ALREADYLIT?

34:24.163 --> 34:26.795
OH, COME ON. I'LL LET YOU
PLAY WITH MY TIE.

34:26.795 --> 34:29.197
HERE'S THE REMOTE.

34:29.197 --> 34:31.469
(chuckles)

34:31.469 --> 34:33.141
(crackling sound)

34:35.204 --> 34:37.706
(indistinct conversations)

34:37.706 --> 34:40.679
DON'T I KNOW YOU
FROM SOMEWHERE?

34:40.679 --> 34:42.851
OKAY.
NOT THE MOST ORIGINAL LINE,

34:42.851 --> 34:47.156
BUT YOU'RE CUTE, SO...
(chuckles) LYNETTE.

34:47.156 --> 34:49.818
RIGHT. RIGHT. YOU'RE PORTER
AND PRESTON'S MOM.

34:49.818 --> 34:51.190
OH, GOD.

34:51.190 --> 34:53.262
MRS. SCAVO WAS
THE COOLEST MOM.

34:53.262 --> 34:55.123
SHE USED TO MAKE US
GRILLED CHEESE

34:55.123 --> 34:58.527
IN THE SHAPE OF DINOSAURS.
SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

34:58.527 --> 35:02.100
I HAVE NO IDEA.

35:05.434 --> 35:09.238
(dance music playing
in distance)

35:09.238 --> 35:10.579
HERE YOU GO.

35:10.579 --> 35:12.681
IT'S PROBABLY THE ONLY SET
OF KEYS WITH A PURPLE LANYARD.

35:12.681 --> 35:15.113
MY KID MADE IT AT CAMP.

35:15.113 --> 35:18.347
LOOK, I'M WEARING SOMETHING
CALLED SKINNY JEANS,

35:18.347 --> 35:19.848
WHICH ARE VERY PAINFUL

35:19.848 --> 35:22.120
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE SOMETHING
CALLED SKINNY LEGS,

35:22.120 --> 35:24.223
SO I JUST WANNA GO HOME
AND PEEL THEM OFF. DO YOU MIND?

35:24.223 --> 35:27.426
NO, NOT AT ALL. I JUST--
I DON'T--I DON'T WORK HERE.

35:27.426 --> 35:28.697
OH.

35:28.697 --> 35:31.300
OH, GOD. I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE NOT THE VALET.

35:31.300 --> 35:34.132
(sighs) I KNEW THIS VEST
WAS A BAD IDEA,

35:34.132 --> 35:36.435
BUT THE GAY GUY IN MY OFFICE
TOLD ME THEY'RE BACK.

35:36.435 --> 35:39.438
NO, THE VEST IS GREAT.

35:39.438 --> 35:40.669
I HAVE IT IN NAVY.

35:42.341 --> 35:44.213
IT'S JUST--I HAVEN'T BEEN OUT
IN SO LONG,

35:44.213 --> 35:45.814
I FIGURED I'D TRY
TO MIX THINGS UP.

35:45.814 --> 35:47.816
YOUHAVEN'T BEEN OUT
IN SO LONG?

35:47.816 --> 35:49.518
LAST TIME I WAS AT A BAR
LIKE THIS,

35:49.518 --> 35:51.350
BEEPER NUMBERS
WERE EXCHANGED.

35:51.350 --> 35:54.152
(laughs) I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THEY BANNED SMOKING IN BARS.

35:54.152 --> 35:57.186
AND HOW DID THE GOOD, OLD,
RELIABLE MARTINI LOSE ITS JOB?

35:57.186 --> 36:00.229
APPLE? CHERRY? WATERMELON?
THOSE ARE SLUSHIE FLAVORS.

36:00.229 --> 36:02.261
(laughs)

36:02.261 --> 36:03.662
I'M LYNETTE.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.234
SCOTT.

36:05.234 --> 36:07.296
BY THE WAY, NOT THAT
IT'S A COMPETITION,

36:07.296 --> 36:09.568
BUT I HAVE TWO LANYARDS
ON MY KEYCHAIN.

36:09.568 --> 36:11.240
THEY'RE PINK.

36:11.240 --> 36:12.801
DAUGHTERS?
 YES.

36:12.801 --> 36:13.902
DIVORCE?

36:13.902 --> 36:15.474
NO, THANKS.
I ALREADY HAD ONE.

36:15.474 --> 36:17.306
(chuckles)
 YOU?

36:17.306 --> 36:19.708
UH, SEPARATED.

36:19.708 --> 36:22.411
(vehicle approaches)

36:24.483 --> 36:26.555
HEY.
 UM...

36:26.555 --> 36:30.319
LISTEN, THIS IS THE FIRST DECENT
CONVERSATION I'VE HAD ALL NIGHT.

36:31.560 --> 36:33.822
WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO BACK
INSIDE AND CONTINUE IT?

36:35.294 --> 36:37.666
I SAY...

36:37.666 --> 36:39.828
POMEGRANATINIS ARE ON ME.

36:39.828 --> 36:41.500
ALL RIGHT. THAT WAS EASY.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.332
YOU CALLING ME EASY?

36:43.332 --> 36:44.973
NOT YET.

36:50.409 --> 36:51.640
UM, PLEASE.

36:51.640 --> 36:53.242
AH.

36:53.242 --> 36:55.914
UH, CAN I GET YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

36:55.914 --> 36:58.317
I HAVE, UH, VODKA.

36:58.317 --> 37:00.789
I HAVE MILK.
I HAVE CHOCOLATE MILK.

37:00.789 --> 37:02.721
I HAVE JUICE BOXES.
 (chuckles)

37:02.721 --> 37:05.654
HAVING KIDS HAS REALLY
RUINED MY GAME, HUH?

37:05.654 --> 37:07.526
VODKA AND CHOCOLATE MILK--

37:07.526 --> 37:09.698
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I GIVE
MY BABY TO CALM HER DOWN.

37:09.698 --> 37:10.729
(chuckles)

37:12.831 --> 37:14.333
CHEERS.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.804
CHEERS.
 (chuckles)

37:21.570 --> 37:24.743
(chuckles nervously)

37:29.017 --> 37:30.649
NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

37:32.250 --> 37:34.783
I'D PUT ON SOME MUSIC,
BUT MY EX GOT ALL MY CDs.

37:34.783 --> 37:36.655
MM.

37:36.655 --> 37:39.758
I COULD TURN ON A BLACK LIGHT,
BUT I'M NOT 16.

37:39.758 --> 37:42.531
MAYBE I COULD LIGHT
SOME CANDLES,

37:42.531 --> 37:46.034
BUT THAT SEEMS LIKE KIND OF
AN OBVIOUS MOVE, RIGHT?

37:47.336 --> 37:49.568
NOT AS OBVIOUS AS THIS.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.745
MAYBE OBVIOUS ISN'T SO BAD.

37:56.745 --> 37:58.377
(gasps)

38:00.509 --> 38:01.710
OHH.

38:01.710 --> 38:03.412
OH, WOW! (gasps)

38:03.412 --> 38:05.854
NO?
 NO. OH, NO, IT'S GOOD.
IT'S GOOD. KEEP GOING.

38:05.854 --> 38:07.486
MMM. MMM.
 (moans)

38:08.957 --> 38:11.790
I HAVE ANOTHER ROOM
THAT I WOULD LOVE TO SHOW YOU.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.692
REALLY?

38:13.692 --> 38:14.893
UH-HUH.

38:14.893 --> 38:17.526
YOU'RE GETTING... BETTER
AT THIS.

38:17.526 --> 38:18.867
MMM.

38:18.867 --> 38:22.831
(moans)

38:22.831 --> 38:24.503
(pants)

38:30.078 --> 38:32.310
(whispers) OW.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.812
(grunts)

38:33.812 --> 38:35.914
OH! HANG ON. HANG ON.

38:35.914 --> 38:38.647
SHOOT!

38:38.647 --> 38:41.390
OH. RIGHT HERE?

38:41.390 --> 38:42.551
OKAY.

38:42.551 --> 38:45.023
NO, I... DROPPED SOMETHING.

38:45.023 --> 38:46.825
OH. CAN I HELP?

38:46.825 --> 38:49.798
MY RING FELL OFF. YOU HAD
TO HAVE SHAG CARPETING, HUH?

38:49.798 --> 38:52.601
UGH. THAT GAY GUY AT MY OFFICE
SAID SHAG WAS BACK.

38:52.601 --> 38:56.365
REALLY NEED TO START GETTING
MY STYLE TIPS FROM SOMEONE ELSE.

38:56.365 --> 38:58.106
DAMN IT. WHERE IS IT?

38:58.106 --> 38:59.938
THIS RUG--
IT SWALLOWS EVERYTHING.

38:59.938 --> 39:01.610
THERE USED TO BE AN END TABLE
HERE AND...

39:01.610 --> 39:03.542
OH, MY GOD! PLEASE DON'T
BE FUNNY RIGHT NOW.

39:05.073 --> 39:07.115
WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.

39:07.115 --> 39:09.017
HERE IT IS.

39:09.017 --> 39:11.620
(sighs) OH.

39:11.620 --> 39:12.951
THANK YOU.

39:16.124 --> 39:19.057
SO, UH, WHERE WERE WE?

39:26.895 --> 39:29.367
I'M SORRY. I CAN'T.

39:30.969 --> 39:34.703
YOU'RE A REALLY GREAT GUY.

39:34.703 --> 39:37.906
YOU'RE NICE AND YOU'RE FUNNY
AND...

39:37.906 --> 39:39.908
WHATEVER YOU WERE DOING...

39:39.908 --> 39:42.681
(voice breaking) TO--TO MY NECK
WAS REALLY WORKING FOR ME,

39:42.681 --> 39:44.983
BUT THE IDEA OF WALKING 10 FEET
INTO YOUR BEDROOM

39:44.983 --> 39:48.757
IS ABOUT THE SCARIEST THING
I CAN THINK OF RIGHT NOW.

39:51.820 --> 39:53.862
OKAY.

39:55.764 --> 39:57.125
I'M...

39:57.125 --> 40:00.699
HOPING TO WORK THINGS OUT
WITH MY HUSBAND,

40:00.699 --> 40:02.070
AND I GUESS I JUST--

40:02.070 --> 40:03.732
I GET IT.

40:03.732 --> 40:05.934
YOU'RE NOT THERE YET.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.907
I'M NOT.

40:10.839 --> 40:12.811
(chuckles)

40:14.142 --> 40:16.184
(sniffles)

40:16.184 --> 40:18.717
WELL, I THINK I SHOULD GO.
(chuckles)

40:18.717 --> 40:20.148
COME ON.

40:25.524 --> 40:26.855
(sighs)

40:30.058 --> 40:31.800
BYE.

40:32.901 --> 40:35.203
I UNDERSTAND YOUR HESITATION.

40:35.203 --> 40:38.607
I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE
WITH A MANICURED LAWN

40:38.607 --> 40:40.669
WHO WOULD OBJECT

40:40.669 --> 40:43.812
WHEN A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS
THREATENS HER COMMUNITY.

40:43.812 --> 40:44.973
BUT MY EYES HAVE BEEN OPENED,

40:44.973 --> 40:47.776
AND I WILL PERSONALLY
GO DOOR-TO-DOOR

40:47.776 --> 40:51.980
TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE SEE
HOW ESSENTIAL THIS PROJECT IS,

40:51.980 --> 40:56.825
SO THAT WHERE WE LIVE
CAN TRULY BE CALLED A COMMUNITY.

40:56.825 --> 41:00.028
(murmuring)

41:05.894 --> 41:08.697
YOU WERE AMAZING.

41:08.697 --> 41:10.468
WELL, I MEANT EVERY WORD.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.671
I WANT TO HELP YOU
ANY WAY I CAN.

41:12.671 --> 41:14.472
GREAT. WELL, UH,
FIRST THING TOMORROW,

41:14.472 --> 41:16.474
I'LL TAKE YOU OUT TO SEE
THE CONSTRUCTION SITE.

41:17.946 --> 41:21.149
YES, WE MAY THINK
WE'RE ALL DESTINED

41:21.149 --> 41:24.813
TO PLAY CERTAIN ROLES.

41:24.813 --> 41:30.088
BUT SOMETIMES THOSE ROLES
CAN UNEXPECTEDLY CHANGE.

41:30.088 --> 41:35.794
A NERVOUS STUDENT MAY DISCOVER
A HIDDEN CONFIDENCE.

41:35.794 --> 41:42.100
A LONGTIME WIFE MAY CONFRONT
A HARSH NEW REALITY.

41:42.100 --> 41:44.202
A BUSY MOTHER

41:44.202 --> 41:48.577
MAY FIND HER ATTENTION
IS NEEDED ELSEWHERE.

41:48.577 --> 41:53.181
AND A WOMAN WHO WANTED
TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF GOOD

41:53.181 --> 41:56.685
MAY FIND HERSELF PLAYING
A MUCH BIGGER ROLE

41:56.685 --> 41:59.788
THAN SHE INTENDED.

41:59.788 --> 42:03.051
I WAS SEARCHING AND SEARCHING
FOR THE PERFECT SPOT,

42:03.051 --> 42:04.923
AND THEN I FOUND IT--

42:04.923 --> 42:06.995
CHAPMAN WOODS.

42:06.995 --> 42:08.997
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN HERE
BEFORE?

42:17.035 --> 42:18.607
ONCE.

42:18.607 --> 42:21.940
WELL, THEY'RE FINALLY GONNA
BREAK GROUND ON TUESDAY,

42:21.940 --> 42:23.942
AND IT'S ALL THANKS TO YOU.

42:23.942 --> 42:27.215
(chuckles) GLAD I COULD HELP.
