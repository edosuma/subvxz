00:03.294 --> 00:05.603
I don't get it, sir.
Why do our doctors have to

00:05.839 --> 00:08.433
put up pictures of themselves
in their patients' rooms?

00:08.675 --> 00:11.587
Because, Ted, not only does it make
our doctors more accountable,

00:11.845 --> 00:14.279
but a recent AMA study showed
that it helps our patients

00:14.514 --> 00:16.265
feel a much closer bond
with their physicians.

00:16.474 --> 00:20.353
Plus, who wouldn't want
this young buck at their bedside?

00:20.645 --> 00:23.762
That picture's so old
the beaches are still segregated.

00:24.024 --> 00:27.334
Look, there's us way in the back.

00:27.610 --> 00:28.804
Doesn't that bother you?

00:28.987 --> 00:30.659
Good God, I'm stunning.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.059
Besides, have you seen
everyone else's picture?

00:35.535 --> 00:36.524
Turk!

00:36.703 --> 00:38.580
Baby, ain't nobody looking at you.

00:41.916 --> 00:42.985
Where was that taken?

00:43.168 --> 00:45.124
Sears. Do you want a copy?

00:46.254 --> 00:49.451
<i>Dr Cox and I were
both taking care of Private Dancer.</i>

00:49.716 --> 00:53.391
See, I went with a younger picture
'cause I like the father-son motif.

00:53.678 --> 00:55.475
That is taken seconds after I won

00:55.680 --> 00:59.593
the watermelon seed spitting contest
at my theatre camp.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.327
Probably my happiest day
as a teenager.

01:02.562 --> 01:06.521
That is both very sad
and not the least bit shocking.

01:06.816 --> 01:08.135
So, Brian, since you're
finally getting discharged,

01:08.318 --> 01:09.512
we all wanted to come say goodbye.

01:09.694 --> 01:11.013
What's next for you, man?

01:11.196 --> 01:12.549
I'm going back in the Army.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.572
I know it's gonna take
a lot of physical therapy,

01:15.825 --> 01:17.975
but that's where I belong, you know?

01:18.203 --> 01:19.238
All the best there, soldier boy.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.767
<i>Brian cared about one goodbye
more than others.</i>

01:21.998 --> 01:25.274
Hey, would you sign this?

01:25.543 --> 01:28.137
I promise you,
I'll put that up in the barracks.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.098
So, you want me to start with
how I still can't walk normally

01:30.298 --> 01:31.572
and then segue into an anecdote

01:31.758 --> 01:33.635
about how you
played my tush like a bongo

01:33.843 --> 01:35.720
until I cried out in pleasurelpain?

01:35.929 --> 01:37.885
- Sorry?
- Your army buddies are gonna see it

01:38.098 --> 01:40.134
I assume you want it filthy.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.306
No, filthy's cool.

01:45.814 --> 01:48.533
Private Dancer, more like
"Private Man-sure. "

01:48.775 --> 01:53.690
As in, "Man, he sure has
a positive outlook on life. " Right?

01:54.030 --> 01:55.019
Carla, you rascal,

01:55.198 --> 01:58.270
I can't help but notice
you love making jokes.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.491
What the devil was that

02:00.704 --> 02:02.979
you were saying earlier
about your coffee?

02:03.206 --> 02:05.720
I said it's so good it's like crack.

02:07.627 --> 02:10.187
I'm telling you guys, it really is.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.610
You would hear crickets chirping,

02:13.800 --> 02:18.078
but they were too uncomfortable about
just how unfunny that actually was.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.946
So, what, I'm not funny?

02:20.140 --> 02:21.539
Well, I think you are very funny

02:21.725 --> 02:24.603
when you're being sarcastic
or you're up on your high horse.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.686
You know, as long as you stay
right in your wheelhouse.

02:27.939 --> 02:30.009
And it's no different for any of us.

02:30.233 --> 02:33.270
Barbie is funniest when
she's an anal-retentive train wreck,

02:33.528 --> 02:35.644
your husband sells it
with a cocky attitude.

02:35.864 --> 02:39.254
Well, you know, I do what I do
when I do what I do.

02:39.534 --> 02:42.731
The Janitor is amusing
because, quite frankly, he's insane...

02:42.996 --> 02:44.475
I made shoes for my rabbit.

02:44.664 --> 02:49.215
And Alice here,
well, she can turn a phrase.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.854
I assume that
because I just called you Alice,

02:53.131 --> 02:57.727
<i>that you are now fantasizing about me
being the maid in The Brady Bunch.</i>

02:58.053 --> 02:59.327
Am I right?

03:00.263 --> 03:01.332
<i>He was.</i>

03:01.514 --> 03:03.550
Now, sadly,
some people just aren't funny,

03:03.767 --> 03:05.723
but they've got funny names.

03:05.935 --> 03:10.326
For example, Dr Beardface,
Dr Mickhead, Colonel Doctor,

03:10.648 --> 03:12.161
and Snoop Dogg Intern.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.350
- Hey, hey!
- My bad, Snoop Dogg Resident.

03:14.569 --> 03:17.641
The Todd is a sexual deviant,
Laverne believes in God,

03:17.906 --> 03:21.785
which is hilarious to me
and Ted is the hospital sad sack.

03:22.077 --> 03:23.396
- I am?
- Yes.

03:24.496 --> 03:27.727
And me?
Well, I'm funny because I commit.

03:27.999 --> 03:34.313
C- O-M-M-I-T-T-T-T-T-T-

03:34.714 --> 03:35.783
T.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.809
I also do funny rants.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.724
To tell you the truth,
there's really only one guy

03:40.929 --> 03:43.807
in this entire dump who is funny,
no matter what he says.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.810
Holy Hell, are my new boxers
made of wool?

03:47.060 --> 03:49.574
'Cause my weasel's getting heatstroke.

03:51.564 --> 03:53.236
The point is, please,

03:54.401 --> 03:56.756
don't tell any more jokes.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.694
I'm not a sad sack, am I?

04:00.907 --> 04:02.659
Ted, your pen exploded.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.805
Bitches, leave!

04:09.082 --> 04:10.071
It's go time.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.445
No, no, no, no, no.
We're playing "guess the movie quote. "

04:12.669 --> 04:14.387
<i>That was from RoboCop.</i>

04:14.587 --> 04:16.737
It's my turn,

04:17.339 --> 04:18.613
"I could have gotten more out. "

04:18.800 --> 04:20.028
<i>Schindler's List.</i>

04:20.218 --> 04:23.972
I took my college girlfriend,
Stacy Blue, to see that on our first date.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.663
I cried, she didn't.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.248
Always thought that was weird.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.503
I remember Stacy.

04:28.685 --> 04:29.674
Of course you do, Turk.

04:29.853 --> 04:31.491
You banged her
while I was in Theology.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.724
For the 100th time, nothing happened!

04:33.940 --> 04:36.408
We had a water-balloon fight,
got wet and took our clothes off.

04:36.651 --> 04:37.879
You walked in and thought the worst.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.263
There were no water balloons.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.085
I looked, no balloons.
You know what? I'm tired of this story.

04:42.323 --> 04:43.836
I have Stacy's number on my phone.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.070
I'm gonna call her,
we'll clear it up once and for all.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.560
Call her.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.145
Hi, Mrs Blue?

04:49.330 --> 04:51.241
Hi, it's Dr John Dorian.

04:51.458 --> 04:55.212
I dated your beautiful daughter
Stacy when we were in college...

04:57.297 --> 04:58.730
She's dead?

05:00.008 --> 05:02.203
She fell asleep in the pool?

05:02.427 --> 05:03.655
Oh, my God.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.740
Incidentally, did she ever mention

05:05.930 --> 05:08.444
banging a black guy
when she was in college?

05:08.683 --> 05:11.151
Had a high-top fade like Kid 'n Play?

05:12.562 --> 05:14.951
Kid 'n Play!
You know, they were a rap group.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.260
Your dead daughter loved them.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.592
Hello?

05:19.778 --> 05:21.052
Real smooth.

05:21.237 --> 05:22.192
You know what, Turk?

05:22.364 --> 05:24.753
I wouldn't mess with me
on watermelon day.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.227
I just changed my shirt.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.604
My chicken!

05:33.000 --> 05:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:45.845 --> 05:47.915
J.D., come on, let's go.

05:48.890 --> 05:49.959
Where'd you get that fish?

05:50.141 --> 05:51.620
Mr Roth owns a pet store.

05:51.810 --> 05:54.085
He's so psyched to be in remission,
he got all the doctors

05:54.312 --> 05:56.382
who helped him out
pets as a thank you.

05:56.606 --> 05:57.880
Who else worked on that case?

05:58.066 --> 05:59.784
Snoop Dogg Resident.

05:59.984 --> 06:02.737
My 'hos are gonna love this.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.316
Hey, why are you checking
Private Dancer's blood sugar?

06:09.536 --> 06:10.889
He's being discharged.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.307
Not yet he isn't.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.089
<i>They had just found him unconscious.</i>

06:14.290 --> 06:15.928
Could you hold this?

06:17.502 --> 06:20.380
- Oh, damn.
- What?

06:20.630 --> 06:22.507
I don't know if it's old age
that's slowing me down

06:22.716 --> 06:25.628
or maybe all that blood I lost last night
fighting that hobo, but I just blew that.

06:25.885 --> 06:26.874
I should have said,

06:27.053 --> 06:28.611
"You think my job is so unimportant

06:28.805 --> 06:30.875
"that I can stand around all day
holding a fish?"

06:31.099 --> 06:33.932
I can't have you all mopey tonight
when we're out clubbing.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.016
It'll throw me off my game.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.743
Fine. I'll wait here,
I'll do this thing right.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.131
Okay.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.970
Well, he gave us quite a scare,
but he's stable and breathing now.

06:49.242 --> 06:52.314
- What happened?
- I'm hoping one of you will figure it out.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.093
He is low on MS Contin.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.892
He's on so many meds, he might have
mixed his prescriptions up.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.845
He'll regain consciousness soon.
I'm gonna wait it out.

07:01.087 --> 07:04.124
- I will, too.
- Keith's out of town, I can stay.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.134
And so can we.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.662
No, we can't!

07:07.927 --> 07:09.883
Baby, remember,
we're supposed to renew

07:10.096 --> 07:12.326
our relations tonight
for the first time since Izzy was born.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.229
Well, I guess the only thing
you're gonna renew tonight

07:14.434 --> 07:16.902
is your driver's licence. Hello!

07:18.146 --> 07:20.580
- Wow.
- I'm funny, damn it.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.965
Maybe you not being
able to have sex tonight

07:23.193 --> 07:26.230
is karmic payback
for having sex with Stacy.

07:26.488 --> 07:29.639
- J.D., drop it.
- What happened that night?

07:29.908 --> 07:31.546
This is how I remember it.

07:32.410 --> 07:35.083
<i>I was coming back from class
and outside our room I heard,</i>

07:35.330 --> 07:39.005
<i>"Oh, my God, it's true
what they say about black guys. "</i>

07:39.292 --> 07:42.090
<i>So, I opened the door
and I see you and Stacy.</i>

07:42.420 --> 07:45.969
<i>So I said, "Get off my girl
before I kick your ass so deep</i>

07:46.257 --> 07:48.532
<i>"you're gonna be crapping
out Keds for a week. "</i>

07:49.010 --> 07:51.046
<i>Then you said, "Chill out, dawg.</i>

07:51.262 --> 07:56.700
<i>"You know you're my boyeeeee.
This ain't be what it looks like, a'ight?"</i>

07:57.060 --> 07:59.449
But it wasn't "a'ight," was it Turk?

07:59.729 --> 08:01.799
This is what really happened.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.882
<i>Stacy and I were waiting for you
to come back from class,</i>

08:05.110 --> 08:09.149
<i>and she said, "Hey, we should have
a water-balloon fight!"</i>

08:09.447 --> 08:14.316
<i>We got all wet from the water balloons
and Stacy was like, "I'm cold.</i>

08:14.661 --> 08:18.370
<i>"Let's take off all our clothes and
get under the covers and warm up. "</i>

08:19.124 --> 08:22.639
<i>Then you came back from your class
and you heard Stacy say,</i>

08:22.919 --> 08:26.434
<i>"Oh, my God, it's true
what they say about black guys. "</i>

08:26.715 --> 08:30.674
<i>Then you came in
and said, "Hey, guys. "</i>

08:30.969 --> 08:34.928
<i>"Calm down, J.D.
This isn't what it looks like. "</i>

08:35.222 --> 08:37.611
<i>Then I said, "All right?"</i>

08:38.643 --> 08:40.837
Nothing happened, so drop it.

08:41.062 --> 08:44.532
No balloons, and we didn't
even have a basketball!

08:44.816 --> 08:47.489
What the hell?

08:47.736 --> 08:49.966
Who changed my picture?

08:50.196 --> 08:53.074
It better not be like this
in all the other rooms, I tell you...

08:54.117 --> 08:56.312
Hey, jerk.
You think I've got nothing better to...

08:56.536 --> 08:59.175
Sorry, wrong jerk.

08:59.414 --> 09:01.928
Dorian, taking forever in there,
I should just...

09:02.167 --> 09:04.635
I'm gonna smash it.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.675
He knows I'm gonna smash it.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.677
He wants me to smash it.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.350
He wants to prove
that I can't not smash it.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.345
It's a head game.

09:13.553 --> 09:16.067
You're never gonna win
a head game with me, Dorian, never!

09:16.306 --> 09:17.261
Never!

09:19.476 --> 09:22.673
No, Turk. I know that face.
Don't you dare make a foofie.

09:22.937 --> 09:26.850
Baby, I had a big old lunch,
now I got the downtown pushdowns.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.105
No.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.346
- Can I just have a little one?
- No.

09:33.990 --> 09:37.460
Oh, my God,
you think farts are funny, too?

09:37.744 --> 09:40.258
- We can't let them know.
- No, no, not that... That.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.135
I changed his picture.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.527
He says I can't make jokes,
but that's funny, right?

09:44.751 --> 09:48.187
Not really. I mean, those pictures
are there to reassure the patients.

09:48.463 --> 09:49.976
I can't believe this.

09:50.173 --> 09:52.368
My picture has been changed
in every single room.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.265
I mean, what the hell? If I wanted
my patients to be more depressed,

09:55.512 --> 09:57.901
I'd just have them read
Newbie's latest blog entry.

09:58.139 --> 10:01.336
"Why being really lonely
is sometimes super awesome. "

10:02.602 --> 10:04.433
Why would anyone do this to me?

10:04.646 --> 10:06.716
It's a mystery is what it is.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.659
I'm never surprised
by what people will do,

10:09.901 --> 10:11.619
or for that matter,

10:11.820 --> 10:13.094
who they will do.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.917
I'm outta here!

10:15.657 --> 10:18.330
Bathroom break.

10:19.411 --> 10:20.639
Turk, don't go.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.996
You're right there
listening to my every move, aren't you?

10:25.250 --> 10:27.320
A small child vomited downstairs.

10:27.544 --> 10:30.502
It smells like pickles and milk,
sort of like one of Enid's burps.

10:30.755 --> 10:33.952
Consider it a chance for you
to prove yourself.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.520
Yes, sir! In fact, wait up,

10:38.763 --> 10:40.754
let's walk together,
I'll tell you about my favourite stain.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.692
Let's turn this corner...

10:44.602 --> 10:46.433
Oh, you're good.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.780
Guys, I think I figured out
what happened to Brian.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.016
This letter from the Army says

10:53.194 --> 10:55.833
his injuries are too severe
to let him back into the service.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.267
The Army is his life.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.686
He didn't take
too many pills by accident.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.309
He was trying to commit suicide.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.690
We can't discharge him. We've got to
get him with one of the shrinks.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.984
The only way we can
make him stay here

11:07.208 --> 11:08.846
is if he admits that he did it.

11:09.044 --> 11:10.796
Yeah, well, I didn't do it.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.807
Oh, it's like you said earlier,

11:15.008 --> 11:18.762
I must have mixed up my prescriptions
and taken too many of one.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.169
How long have you been awake?

11:20.347 --> 11:24.898
Long enough to know that you
need to fart and Carla's not funny.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.865
And J.D.'s imitation of a black guy
is really racist.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.503
He be trippin'.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.717
Brian, this is just a setback.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.731
You can't let it take you
to such a bad place.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.138
I'm not in a bad place,

11:36.363 --> 11:38.558
but if I were, it would be
understandable, right,

11:38.782 --> 11:41.501
'cause what the hell
do I have to live for?

11:41.743 --> 11:45.292
I mean, the only thing waiting for me
in my crappy apartment is

11:45.580 --> 11:49.414
this little disability check to remind me
that the only place that I ever felt

11:49.709 --> 11:51.984
like I really belonged
doesn't want me any more.

11:52.337 --> 11:53.406
But not to worry,

11:53.588 --> 11:54.987
I'm sure there's a huge demand
out there

11:55.173 --> 11:57.687
for a high school grad
who can't sign his name

11:57.926 --> 12:01.521
and gets confused by stuff that
wouldn't faze a five-year-old.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.947
There is no happy future for me,

12:04.140 --> 12:06.813
so please do not tell me
it's all gonna turn around.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.972
Nobody's leaving this room
until you admit to us what you did.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.743
Why should I admit anything to you,

12:11.940 --> 12:15.012
since you guys
aren't that truthful with each other?

12:15.276 --> 12:16.914
<i>Sometimes to get the truth
out of someone</i>

12:17.112 --> 12:18.909
<i>you have to come clean yourself.</i>

12:19.114 --> 12:21.548
Dr Cox, I'm the one
who switched your picture.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.262
Carla!

12:23.451 --> 12:25.089
- I slept with Stacy.
- I knew it!

12:25.286 --> 12:28.084
<i>Of course, some admissions
you don't see coming.</i>

12:28.331 --> 12:31.721
I once tried to kill myself.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.699
<i>After Elliot told us
that she had attempted suicide,</i>

12:39.926 --> 12:42.360
<i>I had to ask the question that was
on everybody's mind.</i>

12:42.595 --> 12:44.745
Was it because I broke up with you?

12:44.973 --> 12:46.247
No, J.D.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.389
Oh, good, good, good, good.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.751
I'm not even sure why I did it.

12:50.979 --> 12:53.129
I guess things just catch up with you,
you know, you get lonely,

12:53.356 --> 12:55.312
you're not happy with
what's happening in your life and...

12:55.525 --> 12:56.878
An amazing guy breaks up with you.

12:57.068 --> 13:00.185
J.D., this is not about you! I was 16!

13:00.447 --> 13:02.517
- So, how'd you try it?
- Brian!

13:02.741 --> 13:04.891
- Please, you're dying to know.
- No, I am not. When Elliot...

13:05.118 --> 13:06.995
Carla, it's fine.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.921
I was all into poetry
back then, you know,

13:09.122 --> 13:11.716
Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf.
I know, shocker.

13:12.542 --> 13:15.852
Well, they both killed themselves.
Plath stuck her head in the oven, but

13:16.129 --> 13:19.360
that was not an option for me
because every time my head gets hot,

13:19.632 --> 13:21.588
I need to pee
and I was not about to be found

13:21.801 --> 13:25.953
lying in a puddle of my own urine.
Not again, not after the prom fiasco.

13:26.264 --> 13:28.380
If you're still not sure
why you tried to off yourself,

13:28.600 --> 13:31.239
I'm starting to get
a pretty clear picture over here.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.117
So, I decided to do it
like Virginia Woolf,

13:34.356 --> 13:36.950
I walked into a lake
and tried to drown myself.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.262
Got up early on a Saturday,
put on my bikini...

13:39.486 --> 13:41.397
Whoa, why would you wear a bikini?

13:41.613 --> 13:44.571
Oh, my one-piece was
in the back of Coach Pongetti's car.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.418
That story informs this one,

13:47.661 --> 13:49.856
but I'm not going to tell it.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.036
Anyhow, I swam out
to the middle of the lake

13:52.248 --> 13:56.082
and I couldn't bring myself to go under,
so I just started, you know,

13:56.378 --> 13:59.290
floating around,
waiting to get tired and then...

13:59.547 --> 14:01.060
Bam, bam, bam, bam!

14:01.257 --> 14:04.966
I got hit in the head by four oars
as our school's rowing team passed by

14:05.303 --> 14:09.262
and then they just picked me out
of the lake and took me home.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.434
Oh, no, Turk, I know that look.

14:11.643 --> 14:14.316
Don't you dare toot
while Elliot is baring her soul.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.598
But, baby, the pressure's building.

14:16.815 --> 14:18.453
No one on Earth is this uncomfortable.

14:20.318 --> 14:23.116
Oh, no, I have to pee.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.557
Come on, fight it, man,
think about something else.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.457
Take your mind off it.

14:26.658 --> 14:28.330
Here we go.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.605
It passed.

14:30.829 --> 14:34.139
And that's a big bowl of swishy liquid.
Damn it!

14:37.210 --> 14:38.962
Look, Elliot, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

14:39.170 --> 14:40.444
but none of you guys have any idea

14:40.630 --> 14:42.461
what it's like to feel
this hopeless in your life.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.027
You know, other than J.D.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.570
Yeah. That's right.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.591
Wait, wait, wait. What's happening?

14:47.804 --> 14:50.238
Brian, I know exactly
how you're feeling.

14:50.473 --> 14:53.112
You should have seen me when I was
dealing with postpartum depression.

14:53.351 --> 14:54.670
I just wanted out.

14:54.853 --> 14:57.128
I'm so glad that I didn't do anything

14:57.355 --> 15:00.233
because I got on anti-depressants
and now I don't feel that way.

15:00.483 --> 15:02.314
That's right, and my baby being happy

15:02.527 --> 15:05.041
is worth
all the vaginal dryness in the world.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.829
<i>And none of us would ever look
at Carla the same way again.</i>

15:10.744 --> 15:12.621
How long can he stay in there?

15:12.829 --> 15:15.582
I haven't eaten anything
since I stole that hobo's pecan pie.

15:15.832 --> 15:18.027
<i>Come on, buddy, get it together.</i>

15:18.251 --> 15:21.448
<i>How're you doing?
The name's Roger Dorsey.</i>

15:21.713 --> 15:24.147
Well, that's not real.
I'm starting to lose it.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.054
<i>How do you know I'm not real?</i>

15:26.259 --> 15:27.977
Well, for one thing,
you're just using my voice,

15:28.178 --> 15:31.329
only slightly higher, like this,
"How you doing, buddy?"

15:31.598 --> 15:35.273
<i>Oh, yeah? Well, if I wasn't real,
could I hit this note?</i>

15:39.522 --> 15:41.274
That was lovely.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.884
Look, man, we all have
those bleak moments

15:45.111 --> 15:47.830
where we swear
we'll never bounce back.

15:48.073 --> 15:51.031
Like when I was 17,
my mom walked in my room

15:51.284 --> 15:53.320
with a look that I had never seen.

15:54.329 --> 15:57.526
And she said, "It's over, Turk.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.543
"Michael Jordan's career is over. "

15:59.751 --> 16:02.106
Is anyone a bigger idiot than you?

16:02.337 --> 16:04.293
Is he the black golfer?

16:04.506 --> 16:06.258
My point is we don't know
what the future holds.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.264
Yeah, well I know what my future holds
if I hold this fart in any longer.

16:09.511 --> 16:10.580
<i>I wonder what would happen.</i>

16:10.762 --> 16:12.081
Fine, let me move out of the way.

16:12.263 --> 16:14.538
All right, everybody clear back.

16:27.112 --> 16:30.343
If only I had a saddle,
I could have ridden you.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.811
I've never seen them live.
Are they good?

16:34.995 --> 16:37.873
If you're wondering
why I'm wearing these,

16:38.123 --> 16:41.081
it's partly because
at the Kelso family Christmas

16:41.334 --> 16:45.407
we all pick one name out of a hat
to buy a gift for and I was lucky enough

16:45.714 --> 16:49.946
to be chosen by my son Harrison's
new life partner, Ray-Ray.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.330
The other reason is that my work shoes

16:52.554 --> 16:56.229
are coated in the toddler vomit
I told you to clean up earlier.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.235
Now, are you going to get on it
or am I docking your pay?

16:59.477 --> 17:01.069
You do what you have to do, sir.

17:01.271 --> 17:04.148
Roger Dorsey and I are seeing
this thing to the finish.

17:04.398 --> 17:06.469
Roger Dorsey was
my squad leader in Vietnam.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.365
He died in my arms.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.162
<i>Tell Bob I love him.</i>

17:12.656 --> 17:16.616
Guys, it's been really great sharing,
really, but I've got to get dressed.

17:16.911 --> 17:18.026
You win, I see your point.

17:18.204 --> 17:21.958
Here is the name
of a really good therapist.

17:22.584 --> 17:24.858
Look, I know.
You think I owe it to myself...

17:25.086 --> 17:28.317
Please, who cares about you?

17:28.590 --> 17:31.150
Never mind the fact that
we've been busting our asses

17:31.384 --> 17:33.579
trying to take care of you
every day for the last three weeks.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.998
I mean, for God's sake,

17:36.222 --> 17:38.099
if I'd known back then
that you were just going to go ahead

17:38.308 --> 17:40.424
and give up,
I'd have saved myself the huge hassle,

17:40.643 --> 17:41.792
smothered you with a pillow

17:41.978 --> 17:45.209
and spent all my extra time
catching up on Newbie's pathetic blog.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.677
<i>Oh, my God, he referenced me
in a tough love speech!</i>

17:47.901 --> 17:49.194
<i>Stop smiling.</i>

17:49.444 --> 17:53.517
So, no, Brian, no.
You don't owe anything to yourself, but

17:53.823 --> 17:56.053
you damn sure owe each one of us.

17:57.786 --> 17:58.901
Fine.

18:01.831 --> 18:03.025
I'll call him.

18:07.671 --> 18:08.945
Hand cramp!

18:13.718 --> 18:16.835
You think that's funny, making me
kill a helpless little animal?

18:17.097 --> 18:19.770
If you didn't want to hold it for me
you could've put it on the counter.

18:20.016 --> 18:21.734
Me?

18:21.935 --> 18:25.723
No, you, you were... I tried... I had to...

18:26.022 --> 18:28.092
Ray-Ray, I started a...

18:28.316 --> 18:30.955
<i>So cold...</i>

18:31.194 --> 18:32.593
Roger?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.178
Rog, stay with me, buddy.

18:34.364 --> 18:37.117
<i>This isn't Nam. Go get me some water.</i>

18:40.036 --> 18:41.754
<i>Knowing Brian had turned a corner</i>

18:41.955 --> 18:44.753
<i>allowed us to get back
to our own pressing issues.</i>

18:45.000 --> 18:46.797
I can't believe
you're pissed about Stacy.

18:47.002 --> 18:49.072
If I could go back in time
and un-sleep with her, I would.

18:49.295 --> 18:53.083
Well, unfortunately, she's dead, Turk.
Congratulations, you win again.

18:55.552 --> 18:56.587
I don't care what you say.

18:56.761 --> 18:58.513
I'm as funny as anybody else
in this place.

19:05.687 --> 19:07.837
That was actually pretty good.

19:09.691 --> 19:11.283
Hey, Brian, wait up.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.475
You accidentally left
that shrink's phone number

19:13.695 --> 19:15.686
in your room's trash can.

19:15.905 --> 19:16.894
Oh, oops!

19:17.073 --> 19:19.826
Okay, you gotta stop finding
all my notes.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.795
You know what really helped me
when I went through this?

19:23.038 --> 19:25.916
Elliot, you didn't go through this.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.521
You went for
a leisurely afternoon drown

19:28.752 --> 19:30.629
and you got hit in the face
with a paddle.

19:30.837 --> 19:34.034
I spent my entire childhood
as an awkward, lonely outcast

19:34.299 --> 19:37.371
with a floozy mom who liked to talk
about how fat I was.

19:37.635 --> 19:39.432
I had zero self-esteem

19:39.637 --> 19:42.310
and I struggled with that for years,
I still do.

19:42.557 --> 19:44.707
But the only difference
between the two of us

19:44.934 --> 19:49.086
is I was smart enough to know that
it's never too late to come back from.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.892
I can't be what I used to be.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.206
I don't even know that guy,

19:56.029 --> 19:59.021
I know this guy and I like him.

19:59.282 --> 20:01.318
All right, let me ask you something.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.216
If I keep working on my rehab, right?

20:05.455 --> 20:07.491
I get my act together,

20:07.707 --> 20:11.416
you think someone like you could go
for someone like me?

20:12.629 --> 20:13.778
Yeah.

20:27.268 --> 20:29.224
If you're ever single,

20:29.437 --> 20:31.428
I'm looking you up.

20:31.648 --> 20:33.001
I hope you do.
