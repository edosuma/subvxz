WEBVTT

00:05.200 --> 00:08.290
Here you are.
Traditional crumpets,

00:08.330 --> 00:10.260
just like my grandmother
made back in London.

00:10.290 --> 00:12.230
This is just an English muffin.

00:12.260 --> 00:13.530
Seriously, what's the difference?

00:13.570 --> 00:16.400
They're not as good.

00:18.370 --> 00:21.200
I think it needs something.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.400
Yeah. Sauce, cheese,
and pepperoni.

00:25.230 --> 00:28.540
And this is why no one likes you people!

00:30.210 --> 00:32.470
I like it.

00:32.509 --> 00:36.150
I saw you hiding yours under the place mat.

00:36.180 --> 00:38.480
Shh, shh.

00:38.510 --> 00:40.210
Knock, knock, knock.

00:40.250 --> 00:42.380
Chancellor Rudy tootietootie!

00:42.420 --> 00:43.550
- Hey!
- Rudy!

00:45.150 --> 00:48.120
All right, we're all
feelin' it. Whoo.

00:48.160 --> 00:51.330
Ooh, homemade English muffins.

00:51.360 --> 00:53.590
Crumpets!

00:53.630 --> 00:55.300
Don't curse at me, wolfie.

00:56.630 --> 00:59.400
Listen up. Big news.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.240
A member of the Russo family.

01:01.270 --> 01:05.269
Has won the esteemed
wizard of the year award.

01:05.310 --> 01:08.180
Oh, my gosh.
All my hard work with the delinquents.

01:08.210 --> 01:10.080
Has finally paid off.

01:10.110 --> 01:13.310
Hold on, senor
"jump to conclusions."

01:13.350 --> 01:17.380
For saving humanity from
the angels of darkness,

01:17.420 --> 01:20.550
you have been named wizard of the year.

01:20.590 --> 01:23.590
Congratulations, Alex.

01:26.490 --> 01:28.160
Wow.

01:28.190 --> 01:31.560
A truly underwhelming
display of enthusiasm.

01:31.600 --> 01:35.170
Great... great job, honey.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.470
- Unbelievable. Wow!
- Congratulations.

01:37.500 --> 01:39.300
Oh, my gosh.

01:39.340 --> 01:43.170
This must kill you.

01:43.210 --> 01:45.440
No, I'm fine.
Why would your award kill me?

01:45.480 --> 01:47.380
It was an honor to be nominated.

01:47.410 --> 01:49.280
I was nominated, right?

01:55.360 --> 01:57.420
Alex, you will be given the award.

01:57.460 --> 01:59.560
At this year's annual wizard banquet.

01:59.590 --> 02:02.330
And it's tradition for the
family of the wizard of the year.

02:02.360 --> 02:05.160
To make a holographic video honoring them,

02:05.200 --> 02:07.130
which will be played at the banquet.

02:07.170 --> 02:10.139
Here's a holograph camera.
Say nice things.

02:10.169 --> 02:11.540
Ha! Good luck.

02:11.570 --> 02:13.340
These ingrates can't even say nice things.

02:13.370 --> 02:16.380
After someone's been baking
for two blasted hours!

02:19.510 --> 02:21.310
Wonderful.
Wizard of the year,

02:21.350 --> 02:23.280
her own banquet,
and we have to make a video.

02:23.320 --> 02:25.420
To say how great she is.
Anything else for Alex?

02:25.450 --> 02:27.490
Ooh, thanks for reminding me, kid.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.490
Because of your heroic act,

02:29.520 --> 02:32.160
you're back in your family's
wizard competition.

02:32.190 --> 02:33.460
I can't believe I almost forgot that.

02:33.490 --> 02:35.160
Wait.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.200
I'm back in the competition?

02:37.230 --> 02:39.160
That means I could be the family wizard.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.100
I know.
I mean, who would have thought.

02:42.130 --> 02:44.170
It'd be you and me
in the running for this thing?

02:44.200 --> 02:47.570
Now this must really kill you.

Hey, look at this gown.
It's on sale.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.600
Does it say "just saved the world",

03:46.630 --> 03:48.500
or "just saving money"?

03:48.530 --> 03:50.500
I don't know,

03:50.540 --> 03:53.270
but this is the worst video game
that I've ever played.

03:55.240 --> 03:57.270
Are you almost done with the abracadoodler?

03:57.310 --> 03:59.240
'Cause I need to use it.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.180
Justin...

04:01.210 --> 04:03.110
You're just mad because
you've always wanted to be.

04:03.150 --> 04:04.150
Wizard of the year.

04:05.580 --> 04:08.220
Hey, Justin.
Do you need some ice?

04:08.250 --> 04:10.090
For what?

04:10.120 --> 04:12.220
For your sore loser.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.290
I'm fine.

04:15.330 --> 04:17.260
Ok, everything happens

04:17.300 --> 04:18.399
oh.

04:18.430 --> 04:20.430
<i>Over here, Chase!</i>

04:20.470 --> 04:22.400
Stop!

04:22.430 --> 04:25.570
You sleazy paparazzi! Stop!

04:25.600 --> 04:28.510
No more pictures! No!

04:28.540 --> 04:30.170
Chase!

04:31.610 --> 04:33.410
What are you doing here?

04:33.440 --> 04:36.310
I heard you'll be receiving
the wizard of the year award,

04:36.350 --> 04:38.310
so I wanted to come by
and congratulate you.

04:38.350 --> 04:40.120
Oh, thank you.

04:40.150 --> 04:41.580
You could've just called.

04:43.420 --> 04:46.220
A congratulatory hug
is a little more personal.

04:46.260 --> 04:48.290
Than a phone call.

04:48.330 --> 04:51.460
I should be the one getting that hug.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.330
I'm really proud of you.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.600
You know, I used to dream
of being wizard of the year,

04:56.630 --> 04:59.240
but was never able to get it.

04:59.270 --> 05:01.500
Oh, well, then you and Justin
have a lot in common.

05:01.540 --> 05:04.210
Right, Justin?
You couldn't do it either.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.350
Now look what you've done.
My mad twitch is coming back.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.290
I better be going too.

05:16.320 --> 05:19.190
But, uh, I'll see you at the banquet.

05:23.560 --> 05:27.430
Keith Keith here for <i>wiz biz tonight.
</i> <i>Now, the big question:</i>

05:27.460 --> 05:30.330
Are the beast tamer and
the wizard of the year dating?

05:30.370 --> 05:32.240
Let's make it official.

05:32.270 --> 05:34.400
Yeah, it's official.

05:34.440 --> 05:36.240
Yeah, we're not dating.
I have a boyfriend.

05:36.270 --> 05:37.470
Now scram.

05:37.510 --> 05:39.310
She speaks the truth.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.340
Now, out of the way.

05:46.320 --> 05:48.220
- How ya doin'? What's up?
- Hey.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.490
- Max Russo.
- Max.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.390
All right, I got in every picture.

05:52.420 --> 05:55.320
Oh, no. Now they're gonna think
you and me are dating.

06:00.330 --> 06:02.300
Ok.

06:02.330 --> 06:04.230
Who wants to pay tribute to Alex first?

06:04.270 --> 06:06.430
Max, why don't you go first.

06:06.470 --> 06:09.300
Before I, uh, start talking about Alex.

06:09.340 --> 06:11.110
Winning the award that I should have won.

06:11.140 --> 06:14.340
I need to figure out a way to
get my eye to stop twitching.

06:15.480 --> 06:17.210
All right.

06:17.250 --> 06:19.520
Your sister just won wizard of the year.

06:19.550 --> 06:21.280
- Ok.
- And action.

06:21.320 --> 06:24.150
Ok.

06:24.190 --> 06:25.390
Wait, why is she winning the award again?

06:26.490 --> 06:28.360
Justin fell for an angel of darkness,

06:28.390 --> 06:30.490
and Alex had to save him and the world.

06:30.530 --> 06:33.430
Hold on, let me get this straight.

06:33.460 --> 06:37.230
So Alex won the award
because Justin messed up?

06:38.600 --> 06:41.340
That's awesome!

06:41.370 --> 06:44.170
Aren't you usually the one
fixing her mistakes?

06:44.210 --> 06:48.140
Yep. Yes, I am.
Why can't people see that?

06:48.180 --> 06:49.510
That's it, I'm ready.
I want to make a video.

06:49.540 --> 06:52.210
- Alex, what I really...
- You're done.

06:52.250 --> 06:55.550
Hi, how's it going.
I'm Justin Russo.

06:55.580 --> 06:57.350
Alex's older brother.

06:57.380 --> 06:59.320
You know something, I think it's just great.

06:59.350 --> 07:01.420
That Alex is winning
probably the highest honor.

07:01.450 --> 07:03.220
That a wizard could receive.

07:03.260 --> 07:06.390
Congratulations to you, Alex.

07:06.430 --> 07:08.460
I'm proud.

07:08.490 --> 07:12.330
Proud that as of today, this
award no longer has meaning.

07:12.370 --> 07:14.070
How could you do this?!

07:14.100 --> 07:16.530
I mean, do you even check
the people you give these to?

07:16.570 --> 07:20.070
Sure, she does one thing,
save the world. Big deal.

07:20.110 --> 07:21.240
Do you have any idea how many times.

07:21.270 --> 07:23.240
She's almost destroyed the world?

07:23.280 --> 07:25.440
Huh? Do ya?!

07:25.480 --> 07:27.550
How could you overlook someone.

07:27.580 --> 07:30.420
Who is successfully tutoring
a class of delinquents?

07:30.450 --> 07:33.090
Who, who has created his own spell?

07:33.120 --> 07:35.090
Who has saved wiz tech twice?

07:35.120 --> 07:37.290
Not once, but twice!

07:37.320 --> 07:40.260
And that's why it should be me,

07:40.290 --> 07:43.430
and not her, but me!

07:47.600 --> 07:49.440
Yeah, there, that should be good.

07:53.570 --> 07:57.140
I don't know why you watch these
wizard celebrity gossip shows.

07:57.180 --> 07:58.380
They're all rubbish.

07:58.410 --> 08:00.380
Goblins make bad life decisions.

08:00.420 --> 08:02.420
Yep, we get it.

08:02.450 --> 08:05.420
Well, you're gonna like it today.
I heard I'm on it.

08:05.450 --> 08:07.520
It's probably wizard of the year stuff.

08:07.560 --> 08:10.360
We are gonna look so cute
at that banquet together.

08:10.390 --> 08:15.160
Oh, wait. I got you a corsage
to give to me.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.100
Here you go.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.530
Oh, my gosh!
It's perfect.

08:19.570 --> 08:23.300
How did you know I like corsages?

08:23.340 --> 08:26.370
<i>Has the dashing beast tamer</i>

08:26.410 --> 08:28.510
<i>Chase riprock</i>
<i>finally met his match?</i>

08:28.550 --> 08:31.480
<i>Photographers caught up with</i>
<i>him making a secret visit</i>

08:31.510 --> 08:35.490
<i>to wizard of the year winner,</i>

08:35.520 --> 08:39.159
<i>Could this be the next</i>
<i>celebrity power couple?</i>

08:39.190 --> 08:40.320
What?!

08:40.360 --> 08:43.429
Let's see what the young
wizards had to say.

08:43.460 --> 08:45.200
I'm sure it's nothing.

08:45.230 --> 08:47.360
Here, watch this part.
I set the record straight.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.100
<i>Now, the big question:</i>
<i>Are the beast tamer</i>

08:50.130 --> 08:51.470
<i>and the wizard of</i>
<i>the year dating?</i>

08:51.500 --> 08:53.340
<i>Let's make it official.</i>

08:53.370 --> 08:56.240
Yeah, it's official.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.310
What?!

09:02.080 --> 09:03.480
What was that? You told them
you guys were dating?

09:03.510 --> 09:05.450
No, no, no! They must have
cut out the part.

09:05.480 --> 09:07.350
Where I told them about you, I swear.

09:07.380 --> 09:11.050
Well, they certainly didn't
cut out the smile on your face.

09:11.090 --> 09:13.490
Did you see it when you said,
"it's official"?

09:13.520 --> 09:16.190
I'll tell you what's official.
I'm quite angry.

09:16.230 --> 09:18.400
It's a gossip show.

09:18.430 --> 09:20.260
They probably didn't
even have a story today,

09:20.300 --> 09:22.330
so they just made something up like that.

09:22.370 --> 09:25.270
I swear, they do it
all the time. Ask Chase.

09:25.300 --> 09:27.540
Chase? Chase.

09:27.570 --> 09:29.510
Yes, your fabulous beast tamer,

09:29.540 --> 09:33.310
who finds any excuse
to come by and say hello.

09:33.350 --> 09:35.380
I'll bet he's outside right now.

09:35.410 --> 09:37.280
Waiting to congratulate you on...

09:37.320 --> 09:40.480
...I don't know,
brushing your hair.

09:42.520 --> 09:44.190
Well, he's not, so I'll just do it.

09:44.220 --> 09:47.220
Well done on brushing your hair!

09:47.260 --> 09:49.490
Mason.

Thank you so much for letting
me go to a wizard banquet.

10:02.410 --> 10:04.440
This is such a big night
for my best friend.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.580
Yeah, well, so no one suspects anything.

10:06.610 --> 10:08.250
About you being in the wizard world,

10:08.280 --> 10:11.380
why don't you stay close to Max.
You could be his date.

10:11.420 --> 10:12.450
What?

10:14.280 --> 10:15.380
Get a sweater.

10:15.420 --> 10:18.150
I'm not giving you my jacket
if you say it's too cold.

10:18.190 --> 10:20.290
Max! Be nice.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.490
I am. I was gonna tell her
she's not my type.

10:25.330 --> 10:27.560
And I was gonna tell you
that you're not my species.

10:29.500 --> 10:32.340
Come on, you two.
Let's go.

10:39.240 --> 10:41.280
Hey, is Mason with you guys?

10:41.310 --> 10:44.350
No. Did you call him?

10:44.380 --> 10:47.220
Yeah, like, five times.
He's not answering.

10:47.250 --> 10:49.190
He was supposed to
meet me here an hour ago.

10:50.360 --> 10:52.220
Come on, people, let's go.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.390
We've got the guest of honor over here.

10:54.430 --> 10:58.360
You're gonna love the great videos
everyone made for you, by the way.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.530
Honey, he's probably still upset
about your fight yesterday.

11:01.570 --> 11:05.200
So, he's standing me up
for my own awards banquet?

11:05.240 --> 11:07.300
Alex, I would take you, but...

11:07.340 --> 11:09.240
...You're not my type either.

11:12.540 --> 11:15.150
Ooh, the flying carpet limo is here.

11:15.180 --> 11:16.510
We've gotta go, Alex.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.590
He's not gonna show up, is he?

11:24.350 --> 11:25.590
I don't think so, <i>mija.</i>

11:35.940 --> 11:37.680
Hey Harper.

11:37.710 --> 11:40.710
I never know what fork
to use at these things, so...

11:40.750 --> 11:42.680
I'm just not gonna use one at all.

11:56.730 --> 11:58.460
Alex...

11:58.500 --> 12:02.540
I'm sorry that Mason stood
you up for the awards ceremony.

12:02.570 --> 12:06.310
But hey, you're still the guest of honor.

12:06.340 --> 12:07.610
Come on, let's go in.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.480
No, wait.

12:09.510 --> 12:11.680
Maybe I can use magic to bring him here.

12:11.710 --> 12:14.550
You don't want to do that.

12:14.580 --> 12:17.750
When people are forced to go to events,

12:17.790 --> 12:20.520
they're usually not
that much fun at the event.

12:20.560 --> 12:23.390
I know you're talking about the
upcoming strawberry festival, Jerry.

12:23.430 --> 12:24.630
And you're going.

12:28.770 --> 12:30.500
Hey, Justin.

12:30.530 --> 12:32.630
I'm really looking forward
to the holograms tonight.

12:32.670 --> 12:34.640
It's the most emotional part of the show.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.840
Except for when I tell the
audience dessert costs extra.

12:38.710 --> 12:41.440
Oh, it'll be emotional.

12:41.480 --> 12:42.780
And Justin...

12:42.810 --> 12:45.450
...And despite the fact
that you're losing.

12:45.480 --> 12:49.520
Your family wizard competition,
I'm sure your heartfelt words.

12:49.550 --> 12:52.650
Will show the wizard council
great sportsmanship.

12:53.860 --> 12:56.460
Right.

12:56.490 --> 12:59.800
I'll bet it even helps you get
reinstated into the competition.

12:59.830 --> 13:02.600
Really looking forward to it, buddy!

13:04.770 --> 13:06.740
I need the tape back!

13:08.770 --> 13:10.570
Alex.

13:10.610 --> 13:11.770
Hey.

13:11.810 --> 13:14.640
I don't know if you caught
that gossip show segment,

13:14.680 --> 13:17.780
but I had nothing to do with how
they made it look like we're dating.

13:17.810 --> 13:20.780
No, I know.
I just wish Mason understood.

13:20.820 --> 13:22.720
Where is he?

13:22.750 --> 13:24.820
He didn't come. He's mad.

13:26.790 --> 13:30.490
Look, if I was him,
I'd be pretty upset too.

13:30.530 --> 13:33.560
They really made it look like we're dating.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.530
I mean, even more so than me.

13:36.570 --> 13:38.570
Standing here admiring
how great you look tonight.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.610
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

13:54.650 --> 13:57.560
- Hey, Justin.
- I wasn't touching this.

13:59.460 --> 14:01.330
I know you weren't.
You can't.

14:01.360 --> 14:02.760
The projector has a protective shield.

14:02.800 --> 14:04.600
Hey, I did you a big favor.

14:04.630 --> 14:06.430
I put some members of the wizard council.

14:06.470 --> 14:09.600
Right in the front row
to catch your heartfelt tribute.

14:14.770 --> 14:16.680
Ok, well, uh...

14:16.710 --> 14:19.440
We, uh, better get going then.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.450
Right now.

14:21.480 --> 14:24.550
Well, we're uh, going now!

14:25.650 --> 14:27.550
Come on, Justin. Let's go.

14:27.590 --> 14:28.590
Come on.

14:28.620 --> 14:30.360
- Wrong way.
- Right.

14:41.800 --> 14:44.340
Well, looks like it's about to start.

14:44.370 --> 14:47.710
It was really nice meeting all of you.

14:47.740 --> 14:49.680
I better head back to my seat.

14:49.710 --> 14:52.650
Way over there.

14:52.680 --> 14:55.810
Way, way, way over there.

14:55.850 --> 14:57.420
On the other side of the...

14:57.450 --> 14:58.650
It's fine. Just sit down.

14:58.680 --> 15:05.590
Welcome to the 3,426th annual
wizard of the year banquet.

15:05.630 --> 15:07.430
It's good to see the wizard council here.

15:07.460 --> 15:09.330
I'm not saying they're old,

15:09.360 --> 15:15.300
but when they were born,
earth was just a rumor. Huh?

15:15.330 --> 15:17.470
That is a very old group of people!

15:18.770 --> 15:21.600
Let's just go to the family holograms.

15:24.610 --> 15:29.780
<i>Hi. I'm Justin Russo,</i>
<i>alex's older brother.</i>

15:29.810 --> 15:34.350
<i>I think it's great</i> <i>that Alex won
probably</i> <i>the highest honor...</i>

15:34.390 --> 15:36.490
Hey, why have a hologram.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.760
When I can speak to you guys right here?

15:38.790 --> 15:40.360
From the heart.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.700
Hello, wizard council.

15:43.730 --> 15:46.670
<i>I'm proud.</i>
<i>Proud that as of today,</i>

15:46.700 --> 15:48.700
<i>this award no longer</i>
<i>has meaning.</i>

15:48.740 --> 15:51.640
<i>How could you do this?</i>
<i>Do you even check the people</i>

15:51.670 --> 15:54.610
<i>that you give these to?</i>

15:54.640 --> 15:57.540
Jerry, what is he doing?

15:57.580 --> 16:01.480
A really good job at
embarrassing the family.

16:01.510 --> 16:03.750
Here's the mom!

16:05.520 --> 16:09.320
Can you believe this guy?
I mean, serious...

16:09.360 --> 16:11.560
Holograms, they don't get things right.

16:11.590 --> 16:14.690
They lie. They're liars.

16:17.530 --> 16:19.630
<i>...Disgusting.</i>

16:19.670 --> 16:21.770
<i>How could you</i>
<i>overlook someone</i>

16:21.800 --> 16:27.640
<i>who's successfully tutoring</i>
<i>a class of wizard delinquents?</i>

16:27.680 --> 16:29.680
<i>Who has certified</i>
<i>his own spell,</i>

16:29.710 --> 16:32.410
<i>and who has saved</i>
<i>wiz tech twice!</i>

16:32.450 --> 16:34.520
<i>Not once, but twice!</i>

16:34.550 --> 16:39.450
<i>And that's why</i> <i>it should
be me,</i> <i>and not her!</i>

16:41.560 --> 16:44.420
<i>Ok. That should be good.</i>

16:47.400 --> 16:49.400
Thank you for your time.

16:55.470 --> 16:58.340
- Mr. Russo.
- Mason.

16:58.370 --> 16:59.710
I've made a dreadful mistake.

16:59.740 --> 17:03.510
I'm afraid I've let Alex down
on such a momentous occasion.

17:05.780 --> 17:08.579
You're apologizing to the wrong person.

17:08.619 --> 17:10.619
Of course.

17:15.460 --> 17:18.359
Him again?!

17:24.700 --> 17:28.369
Whoa. Haven't seen that
in a while.

17:29.810 --> 17:32.680
Mason!

17:32.710 --> 17:34.780
Your boyfriend's a werewolf?!

17:34.810 --> 17:37.380
That would have been some
good information to know.

17:38.680 --> 17:43.750
Um... somebody's foot
is in my salad.

17:43.790 --> 17:46.720
So sorry.

17:51.590 --> 17:52.790
Ladies and gentlemen.

17:52.830 --> 17:56.700
Everyone stay calm.
Everything is fine.

17:56.730 --> 17:59.770
It's just Alex Russo's
jealous werewolf boyfriend.

17:59.800 --> 18:02.370
Going after the beast tamer, Chase riprock.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.540
What am I saying?
That's not fine.

18:04.570 --> 18:06.270
Go ahead and panic.

18:13.580 --> 18:16.280
Mason, stop!

18:16.320 --> 18:19.720
Chase, don't!

18:28.530 --> 18:30.570
Come on!

18:50.350 --> 18:52.650
And down goes wolfie!

18:52.690 --> 18:55.390
Down goes wolfie!

18:58.490 --> 19:00.760
Chase! Stop it!

19:01.760 --> 19:03.600
Stop!

19:12.510 --> 19:14.710
What is the matter with you two?

19:14.740 --> 19:16.380
He attacked me.

19:16.410 --> 19:18.710
I'm sorry for standing you up, Alex.

19:18.750 --> 19:20.580
And I'm sorry for being so jealous,

19:20.620 --> 19:23.720
but when I walked in here
and I saw you two together...

19:23.750 --> 19:25.720
I need to know.
Do you have feelings for him?

19:25.760 --> 19:27.490
I won't go on like this.

19:29.590 --> 19:33.660
Look, Alex. Maybe this
isn't the right time.

19:33.700 --> 19:37.300
Maybe it is.
But I can't stop thinking about you.

19:37.330 --> 19:39.370
You and I would be so great together.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.700
Mason, stop!

19:44.610 --> 19:48.380
Well, who's it gonna be, Alex?
Him or me?

19:51.550 --> 19:53.750
I guess I choose...

19:55.620 --> 19:57.520
...Neither of you.

19:57.550 --> 19:58.590
What?

19:58.620 --> 20:01.760
What?

20:01.790 --> 20:06.390
I believe she said she's
choosing neither of them.

20:08.760 --> 20:10.600
Mason...

20:10.630 --> 20:15.400
You're my boyfriend, and I love you.

20:15.440 --> 20:16.770
But when I told you
there was nothing going on.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.770
Between me and Chase you didn't believe me.

20:18.810 --> 20:21.740
I would have believed you.

20:23.680 --> 20:25.710
This was one of the most
important nights of my life.

20:25.740 --> 20:27.780
And you let me come alone.

20:29.780 --> 20:32.820
Look at this place.

20:32.850 --> 20:35.690
This is a side of you that I've never seen,

20:35.720 --> 20:38.460
and I... I don't like it.

20:38.490 --> 20:39.730
Alex, I came here to apologize.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.560
And that's not what happened.

20:42.760 --> 20:48.500
I... I think
we need a break.

20:52.510 --> 20:54.840
So...

20:54.880 --> 20:56.780
What about us, Alex?

20:58.580 --> 21:01.450
Chase, I think you're a great guy,

21:01.480 --> 21:04.780
but I'm not ready to be
in a new relationship.

21:04.820 --> 21:10.490
I just got out of one
literally a second ago.

21:13.630 --> 21:14.760
Now...

21:16.460 --> 21:21.400
I'm gonna get what I came here for.

21:21.430 --> 21:22.670
Here you go, sweetie.

21:22.700 --> 21:26.470
Alex Russo, wizard of the year.
