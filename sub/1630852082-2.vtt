<i>Of course it is, look at him.
Fucking French.</i>

16:44.440 --> 16:46.040
<i>Fuck sake.</i>

16:47.280 --> 16:49.320
<i>Hello.
Mr LeBlanc?</i>

16:49.320 --> 16:53.080
<i>Louis, please. Hello.
You must be Monsieur Roberto, yes?</i>

16:53.080 --> 16:59.280
<i>Yes, yes. This is DS Dougie...
Douglas Gillman.</i>

16:59.280 --> 17:01.520
<i>All right?
Enchante, enchante.</i>

17:01.520 --> 17:03.040
<i>How was Eurostar?</i>

17:03.040 --> 17:05.000
<i>My preferred way of travel,
the train.</i>

17:05.000 --> 17:09.960
<i>I get the time for reading the notes
and thinking the thoughts. Perfect.</i>

17:09.960 --> 17:11.240
<i>Time.
Yeah.</i>

17:11.240 --> 17:15.680
<i>Well, we'll take you to the hotel
and then on to the crime scene, yes?</i>

17:15.680 --> 17:19.760
<i>D'accord. Lead the way.
PHONE RINGS</i>

17:21.560 --> 17:23.480
<i>Yes?</i>

17:23.480 --> 17:24.960
<i>Yes!</i>

17:27.440 --> 17:29.840
<i>We have a confession.
Huh?</i>

17:29.840 --> 17:32.440
<i>What, Lennox come through
with that civil-service guy?</i>

17:32.440 --> 17:33.960
<i>No. Not the Cornell guy.</i>

17:33.960 --> 17:37.160
<i>Someone walked in, put their hand up
for Britney and for Claire Gorman.</i>

17:38.840 --> 17:42.720
<i>Er, it's another case.
Bloody fine result.</i>

17:42.720 --> 17:45.200
<i>Congratulations.
Hee-hee!</i>

17:52.320 --> 17:54.160
<i>Sweet. Sweet!</i>

17:57.320 --> 17:59.960
<i>You're admitting
that you killed Britney Hamil.</i>

17:59.960 --> 18:02.840
<i>Aye. Britney Hamil.</i>

18:03.920 --> 18:07.480
<i>What's all this?
This? The piece of feral shit,</i>

18:07.480 --> 18:12.280
<i>Gary Franklin, has confessed
to taking Britney and killing her.</i>

18:12.280 --> 18:15.520
<i>And Claire Gorman,
and another missing girl.</i>

18:15.520 --> 18:18.000
<i>He's buried her in woodland
out in Perthshire.</i>

18:18.000 --> 18:19.800
<i>Hazel Lloyd.</i>

18:21.200 --> 18:24.080
<i>His only previous is petty theft.</i>

18:24.080 --> 18:27.720
<i>He was at school with the lassie.
Says he tried to have sex with her.</i>

18:27.720 --> 18:32.200
<i>Couldn't manage. He killed her
by accident after she taunted him.</i>

18:32.200 --> 18:33.680
<i>His first kill.</i>

18:33.680 --> 18:35.960
<i>Gary, Claire Gorman,
take us back to the start.</i>

18:35.960 --> 18:37.560
<i>When did this happen?</i>

18:41.400 --> 18:45.600
<i>Claire Gorman, hmm.</i>

18:45.600 --> 18:48.960
<i>She was my first. But there's more.</i>

18:48.960 --> 18:51.080
<i>Let's put all these
connections together.</i>

18:51.080 --> 18:52.680
<i>Loads more.</i>

18:52.680 --> 18:55.360
<i>'OK. Go on.'
'Hazel was so...'</i>

18:55.360 --> 18:58.680
<i>Boss. The Gorman murder
was ten years ago.</i>

18:58.680 --> 19:02.400
<i>Gary Franklin would have been,
what, barely 16?</i>

19:02.400 --> 19:06.200
<i>Never interrupt a canary
when it wants to sing.</i>

19:06.200 --> 19:08.880
<i>Where was he when Britney was taken?</i>

19:08.880 --> 19:10.920
<i>How did he snatch her?
Has he shown us the van?</i>

19:10.920 --> 19:15.120
<i>He'll tell us everything.
He's obsessed with Hazel Lloyd.</i>

19:15.120 --> 19:17.120
<i>He wants to get that
off his chest first.</i>

19:17.120 --> 19:20.560
<i>Obsessed full stop. It's textbook
serial killer trainspotting.</i>

19:20.560 --> 19:25.240
<i>So I went for a walk with Claire...
'He gets off on the details.'</i>

19:25.240 --> 19:28.560
<i>She'd been cock-teasing me
for ages, eh?</i>

19:28.560 --> 19:31.800
<i>She'd already keyed her hole
to do boys in her year.</i>

19:31.800 --> 19:33.640
<i>'So she was getting it
one way or another.'</i>

19:33.640 --> 19:34.920
<i>Let me in there with him, boss.</i>

19:34.920 --> 19:38.040
<i>No. We're gonna bang this guy up
for Britney.</i>

19:38.040 --> 19:40.520
<i>You eliminate a tie-in
with the French murder,</i>

19:40.520 --> 19:44.720
<i>because the public are spooked
with this serial killer stuff.</i>

19:44.720 --> 19:46.200
<i>'She was teasing me...'</i>

19:46.200 --> 19:48.280
<i>I'm going to update
the police committee.</i>

19:48.280 --> 19:49.560
<i>'She was asking...'</i>

19:49.560 --> 19:54.000
<i>Then I'm going to Perth
to find Hazel Lloyd's body.</i>

19:54.000 --> 19:57.720
<i>'Do you have any exact dates
for this here, Gary?'</i>

19:57.720 --> 20:00.080
<i>I think he knows a lot
about these cases.</i>

20:00.080 --> 20:01.640
<i>I don't believe he killed Britney,</i>

20:01.640 --> 20:04.360
<i>but this has obviously got you...
Ray?</i>

20:04.360 --> 20:06.200
<i>KNOCKING</i>

20:06.200 --> 20:09.800
<i>DI Lennox entering the room.
DC McCorkle leaving the room.</i>

20:13.160 --> 20:14.520
<i>CLEARS HIS THROAT</i>

20:17.640 --> 20:20.240
<i>I'm trying to work out your
connection with these three girls.</i>

20:20.240 --> 20:21.480
<i>Why those three?</i>

20:21.480 --> 20:25.040
<i>Well, Claire was the one
I wanted to be with.</i>

20:25.040 --> 20:26.880
<i>And you know what happened there.</i>

20:26.880 --> 20:31.280
<i>The other two, you get a taste
for it, eh? You cannae stop.</i>

20:31.280 --> 20:34.240
<i>Right. Well, let's talk about
Claire. Must have been hard,</i>

20:34.240 --> 20:37.840
<i>getting her in your car
with those high heels on, eh?</i>

20:37.840 --> 20:40.760
<i>Well... Where there's a will,
there's a way.</i>

20:40.760 --> 20:44.160
<i>So, Claire wouldnae get your hole.
Well, fair enough.</i>

20:44.160 --> 20:47.200
<i>I understand that. You're a man
of passions, and sometimes, lasses,</i>

20:47.200 --> 20:51.880
<i>they just didnae get that. They go
for the shallow, smarmy creep, eh?</i>

20:51.880 --> 20:54.840
<i>I'm fascinated
by how you managed to get Britney</i>

20:54.840 --> 20:56.760
<i>into the back of your
black Toyota Prius.</i>

20:56.760 --> 20:59.840
<i>I'll tell you all about that.
I'm not talking about her right now.</i>

20:59.840 --> 21:01.320
<i>What did you use to tie her up?</i>

21:02.800 --> 21:04.920
<i>I, erm...
These are important details, Gary.</i>

21:04.920 --> 21:07.560
<i>The beasts will want to know.
Beasts?</i>

21:07.560 --> 21:11.080
<i>See, this, this probably seems like
a smart move.</i>

21:11.080 --> 21:14.400
<i>You're thinking all the true crime
groupies will be lining up</i>

21:14.400 --> 21:16.440
<i>for conjugal visits.
That's not what...</i>

21:16.440 --> 21:20.320
<i>You're forgetting one thing.
The beasts wing.</i>

21:20.320 --> 21:22.160
<i>You will be surrounded by</i>

21:22.160 --> 21:25.800
<i>the monsters that you pretend
to be one of. But, oh, for sure,</i>

21:25.800 --> 21:28.000
<i>the conjugal visits
will be abundant,</i>

21:28.000 --> 21:30.760
<i>but they wouldnae be from
the lost women that see themselves</i>

21:30.760 --> 21:32.280
<i>as saviours of violent men.</i>

21:32.280 --> 21:34.360
<i>And this cock of yours? Hoo!</i>

21:34.360 --> 21:37.880
<i>Prized by these monsters, mate.
Even more than your arsehole,</i>

21:37.880 --> 21:40.800
<i>because that's what they want -
to exonerate themselves</i>

21:40.800 --> 21:44.880
<i>by claiming this trophy
that defiled those girls.</i>

21:44.880 --> 21:47.600
<i>Do you want to go there, Gary?
Because it doesnae matter to us.</i>

21:47.600 --> 21:49.360
<i>It won't matter to the monsters.</i>

21:49.360 --> 21:52.120
<i>Do you want to fucking go there?!
No, no!</i>

21:52.120 --> 21:55.880
<i>Do you want to fucking go there?
I didnae touch them!</i>

21:55.880 --> 21:58.520
<i>I didn't do anything.
I swear, I didn't.</i>

21:58.520 --> 22:03.000
<i>Claire was wearing trainers,
you daft fucking twat.</i>

22:04.360 --> 22:08.320
<i>I didnae do anything! I didn't!
I didnae do anything.</i>

22:08.320 --> 22:12.280
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry I did it.</i>

22:12.280 --> 22:14.960
<i>Jesus Christ, Ray.
Bob's gonna be so pissed off.</i>

22:14.960 --> 22:19.040
<i>Well, he might just have to get over
his fucking aversion to police work.</i>

22:19.040 --> 22:21.240
<i>Do you really think
we're chasing Confectioner?</i>

22:21.240 --> 22:25.560
<i>Yeah. Told us too. He's just
shitting it about the politics.</i>

22:25.560 --> 22:27.480
<i>And that Cornell's Confectioner?</i>

22:27.480 --> 22:29.720
<i>There's only two ways
that we can know.</i>

22:29.720 --> 22:34.800
<i>One, by finding Cornell. Two, by
eliminating all the other suspects.</i>

22:36.800 --> 22:38.040
<i>KNOCKING</i>

22:41.160 --> 22:42.440
<i>Well?</i>

22:43.640 --> 22:46.640
<i>You saved me freezing
my bollocks off in Perthshire.</i>

22:46.640 --> 22:48.920
<i>But I fucked up, Bob.</i>

22:48.920 --> 22:51.280
<i>There was a chain of command,
and I broke it.</i>

22:51.280 --> 22:53.960
<i>I undermined you, and I'm sorry.</i>

22:55.120 --> 22:58.080
<i>HE GUFFAWS</i>

22:58.080 --> 23:00.200
<i>Even steal my fucking lines!</i>

23:05.160 --> 23:09.400
<i>Alex Ferguson used to manage
Eric Cantona</i>

23:09.400 --> 23:11.360
<i>differently to his other players.</i>

23:11.360 --> 23:15.760
<i>Be my Eric Cantona.
Don't be my Beckham.</i>

23:15.760 --> 23:18.640
<i>Do not be my fucking Jaap Stam.</i>

23:21.400 --> 23:25.640
<i>Now, lay it all out for me...
as you see it.</i>

23:25.640 --> 23:30.560
<i>Er... Well, we're looking
for Graham Cornell.</i>

23:30.560 --> 23:33.280
<i>Still no sign. It's hard to vanish
like that these days</i>

23:33.280 --> 23:36.480
<i>without any help, but could Cornell
be the Confectioner?</i>

23:36.480 --> 23:39.000
<i>Cos I don't think Ellis is.</i>

23:39.000 --> 23:42.160
<i>You will prioritise
suspects that we have.</i>

23:42.160 --> 23:44.440
<i>Loughran. Cornell.</i>

23:44.440 --> 23:47.760
<i>Instead of trying to overturn
a previous conviction.</i>

23:47.760 --> 23:50.920
<i>Or you are done here. End of.</i>

23:50.920 --> 23:52.560
<i>You got it?</i>

23:52.560 --> 23:54.800
<i>KNOCKING</i>

23:54.800 --> 23:57.040
<i>Patrol are saying
Tommy Loughran's back home.</i>

23:58.520 --> 23:59.760
<i>Go.</i>

24:02.640 --> 24:05.520
<i>Providence.
I didn't know you believed in God.</i>

24:05.520 --> 24:09.040
<i>I don't. But there's one thing
those Bible bashers have got right.</i>

24:09.040 --> 24:10.280
<i>What's that?</i>

24:10.280 --> 24:12.600
<i>We're those just fighting
against flesh and blood.</i>

24:12.600 --> 24:14.080
<i>We're fighting against evil.</i>

24:14.080 --> 24:16.280
<i>These beasts suck the life
out of their victims.</i>

24:16.280 --> 24:18.680
<i>They're fucking vampires.</i>

24:26.400 --> 24:29.960
<i>Hello, Tommy.
You took your time.</i>

24:37.200 --> 24:39.600
<i>I never took any bairn.
Didn't say you had.</i>

24:39.600 --> 24:42.240
<i>Did you hear me ask
if he'd abducted anyone?</i>

24:42.240 --> 24:43.960
<i>Nope.
I asked where you were</i>

24:43.960 --> 24:45.960
<i>eight forty-five
on Thursday morning.</i>

24:45.960 --> 24:49.480
<i>I listen to the radio.
I know why you're here.</i>

24:50.960 --> 24:53.360
<i>Sit down. I'm getting a crick
looking up at you.</i>

24:53.360 --> 24:56.000
<i>We're interviewing you as
a potential witness, not a suspect.</i>

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
<i>Did you see this girl
when you left the house?</i>

25:07.280 --> 25:09.800
<i>We tend to keep ourselves
to ourselves, eh, Percy boy?</i>

25:09.800 --> 25:12.080
<i>Maybe you saw something now,
did you?</i>

25:12.080 --> 25:15.960
<i>What's that, Percy boy?
You never saw a van?</i>

25:15.960 --> 25:17.760
<i>Or a wee lassie?</i>

25:17.760 --> 25:20.920
<i>You were too busy
sniffing lamp posts.</i>

25:22.680 --> 25:25.680
<i>It's all I can do
to walk 50 yards down the street</i>

25:25.680 --> 25:28.160
<i>to let Percy have a pish.</i>

25:28.160 --> 25:32.080
<i>While I concentrate on when I might
cease to draw another breath.</i>

25:32.080 --> 25:33.560
<i>Asbestosis.</i>

25:38.040 --> 25:41.360
<i>I... I saw something.</i>

25:42.800 --> 25:45.920
<i>I saw a wee lassie.
On her way to school.</i>

25:48.720 --> 25:51.720
<i>In a bright red blazer.
Girl has a wee smile.</i>

25:55.120 --> 25:57.840
<i>'She was walking past a van.</i>

25:57.840 --> 26:00.600
<i>'Then she just... disappeared.</i>

26:00.600 --> 26:04.280
<i>'Kiddies being snatched up
off the street in broad daylight.</i>

26:04.280 --> 26:07.040
<i>'It's not something you see
every day.'</i>

26:07.040 --> 26:11.760
<i>Did you see a man in the van?
No. Couldn't really see anything.</i>

26:11.760 --> 26:14.480
<i>I heard the side door open.
It must have been behind it.</i>

26:17.640 --> 26:20.400
<i>You're not long out of uniform
by the look of it, aye?</i>

26:20.400 --> 26:22.720
<i>What's that supposed to mean?</i>

26:22.720 --> 26:27.400
<i>I can see you in that black uniform,
a nice wee blouse.</i>

26:29.200 --> 26:30.720
<i>Hair tied up.</i>

26:31.960 --> 26:33.600
<i>Your hair tied up
in a nice wee bun, eh?</i>

26:35.480 --> 26:36.920
<i>Or a ponytail, eh?</i>

26:38.600 --> 26:42.000
<i>No, I don't think I did.</i>

26:42.000 --> 26:44.320
<i>GASPING</i>

26:52.640 --> 26:53.680
<i>MACHINE BEEPS</i>

26:56.040 --> 27:00.520
<i>DS Drummond... you seem to have
inadvertently stood on</i>

27:00.520 --> 27:03.400
<i>Mr Loughran's oxygen tube.</i>

27:03.400 --> 27:05.800
<i>Oh. Have I?</i>

27:06.840 --> 27:08.480
<i>GASPING</i>

<i>Clumsy.</i>

<i>COUGHING AND SPLUTTERING</i>

27:24.840 --> 27:29.200
<i>If you could just jot your
phone number down here, Tommy, eh?</i>

27:30.480 --> 27:32.440
<i>You've been very helpful, mate.</i>

27:34.280 --> 27:38.280
<i>You'll have to shout it out to me.
The disc on Percy's collar.</i>

27:52.640 --> 27:57.920
<i>0-7-7-0-0-9-0-0-6-2-4.</i>

28:05.080 --> 28:06.440
<i>Thanks, Tommy.</i>

28:15.120 --> 28:18.440
<i>I, er... I have to apologise.</i>

28:18.440 --> 28:20.200
<i>That was very unprofessional.</i>

28:21.560 --> 28:23.840
<i>It was indeed, DS Drummond.</i>

28:23.840 --> 28:27.440
<i>But it was fucking brilliant.
Bet it felt good, eh?</i>

28:27.440 --> 28:29.040
<i>HE LAUGHS
Aye, it did.</i>

28:29.040 --> 28:31.360
<i>And we struck gold.
How's that?</i>

28:31.360 --> 28:33.800
<i>Well, the yellow paper
found where Britney went missing.</i>

28:33.800 --> 28:36.120
<i>Loughran had a ream of it.
That's stretching it a bit, no?</i>

28:36.120 --> 28:38.160
<i>Besides, look at him.
He's hardly got the energy.</i>

28:38.160 --> 28:40.360
<i>Could be part of a ring.
Wolves often hunt in packs.</i>

28:40.360 --> 28:44.040
<i>OK. Got the intel to back it up?
Connections?</i>

28:44.040 --> 28:46.720
<i>Sure we will have. He's been
caught with material in the past.</i>

28:46.720 --> 28:49.200
<i>I'll go through the files.
Better you than me.</i>

28:49.200 --> 28:51.840
<i>No amount of training prepares you
for child porn, hey?</i>

28:51.840 --> 28:54.960
<i>No such fucking thing as child porn.
It's abuse.</i>

28:54.960 --> 29:00.160
<i>Yeah. I'm sorry, I didn't know.
No, no, it's OK. I'm sorry.</i>

29:01.440 --> 29:05.160
<i>It's the sounds that kill me.
I can't get them out my head.</i>

29:05.160 --> 29:06.800
<i>Yeah, me neither.</i>

29:08.080 --> 29:11.280
<i>Someone's got to bear witness

29:16.160 --> 29:18.520
<i>Are you sure that paper was yellow?</i>

29:18.520 --> 29:21.640
<i>The... What the fuck?</i>

29:21.640 --> 29:23.760
<i>HORN BLARES</i>

29:23.760 --> 29:25.440
<i>What the hell, Ray?</i>

29:25.440 --> 29:27.400
<i>It was yellow.</i>

29:27.400 --> 29:31.760
<i>I could have sworn it was...
It was yellow. I mean...</i>

29:32.840 --> 29:35.040
<i>The lighting was low. You might...
Fuck sake.</i>

29:36.520 --> 29:37.680
<i>Easy mistake.</i>

29:37.680 --> 29:42.080
<i>Aye. Should get myself
to Specsavers, eh?</i>

29:43.280 --> 29:44.680
<i>Don't mention this to the others.</i>

29:50.000 --> 29:51.640
<i>Pull over. Pull over.</i>

29:53.440 --> 29:56.880
<i>That for Graham Cornell?
Er, aye.</i>

29:56.880 --> 29:59.320
<i>That's a different address
on the package.</i>

29:59.320 --> 30:01.920
<i>It's been redirected.
Happens all the time.</i>

30:01.920 --> 30:03.880
<i>Whoa, come on.
It's OK, mate.</i>

30:05.000 --> 30:07.120
<i>Sex toys. Bondage.</i>

30:07.120 --> 30:11.160
<i>Kinky bastard.
Each to their own, eh?</i>

30:11.160 --> 30:12.960
<i>Let's go see
what we can find out there.</i>

30:14.120 --> 30:16.320
<i>Enjoy.

<i>'Fucking press

30:21.360 --> 30:23.520
<i>Not called that nowadays.
'Hey?'</i>

30:23.520 --> 30:26.360
<i>Not the fucking press nowadays.
It's the fucking media.</i>

30:26.360 --> 30:29.080
<i>'Oh, don't act
a fucking wideo cunt with me, Ray.</i>

30:29.080 --> 30:31.200
<i>'Find Cornell!</i>

<i>'Erm, is Amanda with you?
You got me on speakerphone?'</i>

30:36.560 --> 30:40.400
<i>Yes to both, boss.
'Er, pardon the French.'</i>

30:42.360 --> 30:46.120
<i>Why is he getting mail redirected
from a flat two miles away?</i>

30:46.120 --> 30:48.800
<i>Maybe it's an office,
business address?</i>

30:52.200 --> 30:55.840
<i>Ray. Ray, we don't have a warrant.</i>

30:55.840 --> 30:58.400
<i>A full forensic team should be here.</i>

31:00.320 --> 31:02.880
<i>You stole those
from Cornell's flat.</i>

31:02.880 --> 31:05.160
<i>You are gonna fuck up
our entire investigation,</i>

31:05.160 --> 31:06.280
<i>going rogue like this.</i>

31:06.280 --> 31:08.600
<i>By the time we've fannied around
with all that crap,</i>

31:08.600 --> 31:11.120
<i>the trail's gone cold.
HE SHIVERS</i>

31:17.440 --> 31:18.520
<i>Hello?</i>

31:18.520 --> 31:21.280
<i>Why would he live in that flat
if he's got this one?</i>

31:21.280 --> 31:22.960
<i>Check who owns it.</i>

31:46.560 --> 31:48.160
<i>What is this place?</i>

31:49.800 --> 31:53.200
<i>It's like something out of
the Spanish inquisition.</i>

31:53.200 --> 31:55.920
<i>Jesus.
Won't find him in here.</i>

31:59.400 --> 32:01.560
<i>What's that smell?</i>

32:01.560 --> 32:04.680
<i>What?
Whiff of sulphur.</i>

32:05.960 --> 32:07.360
<i>Devil himself.</i>

32:08.360 --> 32:09.400
<i>HE CHUCKLES</i>

32:10.800 --> 32:13.520
<i>Forensics will have
a field day in here.</i>

32:13.520 --> 32:15.960
<i>Wouldn't want to be
on the receiving end of that.</i>

32:18.680 --> 32:21.320
<i>See this?</i>

32:21.320 --> 32:22.480
<i>Britney?</i>

32:28.360 --> 32:30.920
<i>'How delightful is the imagination.</i>

32:30.920 --> 32:32.880
<i>'Nothing resists us.</i>

32:32.880 --> 32:35.960
<i>'It means that every crime is ours,</i>

32:35.960 --> 32:40.040
<i>'and we employ them all and
multiply the horror a hundredfold.'</i>

32:40.040 --> 32:43.560
<i>Marquis de Sade, he's the freak
that all this shite is named after.</i>

32:43.560 --> 32:45.960
<i>You've read his books?
You'd be surprised.</i>

32:45.960 --> 32:48.640
<i>Surprised that you read
an 18th-century French philosopher?</i>

32:48.640 --> 32:50.080
<i>Or how depraved he was?</i>

32:50.080 --> 32:52.720
<i>His books are not really about sex.
They're more about power.</i>

32:52.720 --> 32:55.160
<i>Raw power.
Yeah?</i>

32:55.160 --> 32:58.000
<i>Totally. I mean, that's
what makes them so terrifying.</i>

33:00.920 --> 33:05.240
<i>"To Daddy RG.
Thank you for teaching me."</i>

33:11.120 --> 33:12.440
<i>RG.</i>

33:16.560 --> 33:20.800
<i>We had a...
a suspect in custody earlier today,</i>

33:20.800 --> 33:25.880
<i>but he's no longer a, erm...
a person of interest.</i>

33:25.880 --> 33:28.240
<i>We are pursuing, erm...</i>

33:29.560 --> 33:32.880
<i>..other avenues,
a-and I remain confident.</i>

33:32.880 --> 33:36.400
<i>Can I just say that,
as distressing as this case is,</i>

33:36.400 --> 33:40.080
<i>I have full confidence
in Chief Superintendent Toal</i>

33:40.080 --> 33:41.720
<i>and his amazing officers.</i>

33:42.720 --> 33:44.720
<i>Let them do their jobs.</i>

33:56.200 --> 33:57.960
<i>I thought you didn't drink.</i>

33:59.000 --> 34:02.040
<i>Sometimes, it affords clarity
amidst the confusion.</i>

34:02.040 --> 34:04.360
<i>Let's go through Cornell again.</i>

34:04.360 --> 34:08.040
<i>So, he befriends Angela.
Learns the girl's movements.</i>

34:08.040 --> 34:10.760
<i>Takes time off work, disappears
around the same time as Britney.</i>

34:10.760 --> 34:13.320
<i>It's all circumstantial.
For now, yeah.</i>

34:13.320 --> 34:14.880
<i>PHONE CHIMES</i>

34:18.880 --> 34:21.560
<i>So, Cornell doesnae start
at the civil service</i>

34:21.560 --> 34:24.280
<i>until after the murders
of Stacy and Nuala.</i>

34:24.280 --> 34:26.120
<i>We looked into him,</i>

34:26.120 --> 34:29.360
<i>as to how Graham Cornell could have
killed Stacy or Nuala.</i>

34:29.360 --> 34:32.240
<i>He was a VSO in Ghana
on those timelines.</i>

34:32.240 --> 34:34.440
<i>So it's unlikely he's Confectioner.</i>

34:39.440 --> 34:43.680
<i>It doesn't mean he's not responsible
for Britney Hamil, though, eh?</i>

34:43.680 --> 34:46.800
<i>Appreciate you indulging me
and looking into it, eh?</i>

34:46.800 --> 34:49.840
<i>You're welcome, Ray, but,
at the risk of sounding like Bob...</i>

34:49.840 --> 34:51.840
<i>AS BOB:</i> <i>..let's focus
on this fucking case, eh?</i>

34:51.840 --> 34:54.480
<i>Sorry, keep jumping ahead. Or back.</i>

34:54.480 --> 34:57.240
<i>Normally hooch or snatch.
All right, sweetheart?</i>

34:57.240 --> 34:59.880
<i>What's up?
All right, darlin'?</i>

34:59.880 --> 35:02.480
<i>Oh, Raymond.</i>

35:02.480 --> 35:04.840
<i>You must join us.
We've booked a table.</i>

35:04.840 --> 35:09.040
<i>So, I've made it my task
to civilise Douglas Gillman.</i>

35:09.040 --> 35:11.360
<i>The surrounding is beautiful,
of course,</i>

35:11.360 --> 35:14.080
<i>but I'm for needing your help here.</i>

35:14.080 --> 35:15.760
<i>Worthy of difficult tasks, Louis.</i>

35:15.760 --> 35:18.720
<i>I'd love to help,
but I do have somewhere to be.</i>

35:18.720 --> 35:21.920
<i>Oh, that's too bad. Perhaps
the lovely Amanda will join us?</i>

35:21.920 --> 35:25.960
<i>Erm... No. Unfortunately,
I need to be making tracks as well.</i>

35:25.960 --> 35:29.760
<i>You bevvying again, Lenny? One-way
ticket to the park bench, that.</i>

35:29.760 --> 35:32.120
<i>Kick you off it first, mate, eh?</i>

35:37.880 --> 35:40.720
<i>Wonder what the story there is.
Oh, they're partners.</i>

35:40.720 --> 35:44.120
<i>And very professional.
It's innocent, I'm sure.</i>

35:44.120 --> 35:47.760
<i>Aye, maybe. But Lennox likes to make
out that he's Mr Nice Guy.</i>

35:47.760 --> 35:50.200
<i>But when he smells nonce,
he plays dirty.</i>

35:50.200 --> 35:53.360
<i>And when he plays dirty,
anything goes.</i>

36:05.760 --> 36:07.040
<i>God.</i>

36:08.760 --> 36:13.840
<i>'Grant me the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change,</i>

36:13.840 --> 36:16.840
<i>'the courage to change
the things I can.'</i>

36:20.040 --> 36:22.920
<i>Shite. It's all fucking shite.</i>

36:53.920 --> 36:56.480
<i>WOMAN:</i> <i>So, how is Rod?
No.</i>

36:56.480 --> 36:58.840
<i>SHE LAUGHS
OK.</i>

36:58.840 --> 37:01.760
<i>Edinburgh Merchant schoolboy

37:01.760 --> 37:04.360
<i>what his fingers and his tongue
are for. He was like...</i>

37:04.360 --> 37:07.240
<i>Yes. Yeah, he needs
a road map in bed.</i>

37:07.240 --> 37:10.680
<i>Oh, I'm so sorry.
No. But between you and me, OK,</i>

37:10.680 --> 37:14.480
<i>between you and me... I've met
somebody a bit more exciting.</i>

37:15.600 --> 37:18.600
<i>Oh, right, OK.
And does exciting mean married?</i>

37:18.600 --> 37:21.680
<i>Yes. OK. It does. Mm-hm.
Estelle!</i>

37:23.040 --> 37:25.840
<i>You've got to keep that
on the down-low. You've got to.</i>

37:25.840 --> 37:27.280
<i>Of course.
OK.</i>

37:27.280 --> 37:29.080
<i>What's, erm... What's his name?
Ray.</i>

37:29.080 --> 37:33.440
<i>Ray. That was it.
Yeah. Yeah, he's good. He's good.</i>

37:33.440 --> 37:35.400
<i>I'm a bit worried about him
at the moment.</i>

37:35.400 --> 37:37.960
<i>He's under a ton of stress at work,
but...</i>

37:40.320 --> 37:43.040
<i>Oh, shit.
What?</i>

37:43.040 --> 37:45.480
<i>That is our senior project director,
Mr Mount McKendrick.</i>

37:45.480 --> 37:48.840
<i>And that is not his wife.</i>

37:54.480 --> 37:56.040
<i>Lucky woman.</i>

37:57.840 --> 37:59.720
<i>Look, there's just some things,
as head of HR,</i>

37:59.720 --> 38:03.520

OK, OK.</i>

44:24.240 --> 44:27.080
<i>It's obviously very, er...
very distressing,</i>

44:27.080 --> 44:31.240

we are leaving no stone unturned</i>

44:31.240 --> 44:34.800

perpetrator of this heinous crime.</i>

44:37.040 --> 44:39.240
<i>CLINKING</i>

44:40.960 --> 44:45.880
<i>If I could crave your indulgence,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

44:45.880 --> 44:49.800
<i>The Newtown Affiliates were
formed... Can you believe it?</i>

44:49.800 --> 44:53.520
<i>..ten years ago,
to facilitate communication</i>

44:53.520 --> 44:57.200
<i>between the great and the good
of our business</i>

44:57.200 --> 44:59.240
<i>and political communities.
APPLAUSE</i>

44:59.240 --> 45:03.440
<i>'People say it's all about greed
and self-interest.</i>

45:03.440 --> 45:08.200
<i>'But history has shown us that greed
and self-interest are the engines</i>

45:08.200 --> 45:10.400
<i>'that drive our civilization.'</i>

45:10.400 --> 45:13.400
<i>Nothing can stop us.</i>

<i>Richie Gulliver,
I'm arresting you in connection</i>

45:30.120 --> 45:32.040
<i>with the murder of Britney Hamil.</i>

45:32.040 --> 45:33.640
<i>You're not obliged
to say anything...</i>

45:33.640 --> 45:34.920
<i>Is this a practical joke?</i>

45:34.920 --> 45:39.480
<i>Anything you do say will be noted
and may be used in evidence.</i>

45:39.480 --> 45:42.080
<i>Oh, you're not...
You're not gonna cuff me, are...?</i>

45:43.720 --> 45:47.120

a terrible misunderstanding.</i>

45:47.120 --> 45:51.040
<i>'There's satisfaction in
stripping some absolute bastard</i>

45:51.040 --> 45:54.720
<i>'who thinks they're beyond the laws
the rest are compelled to obey</i>

45:56.960 --> 45:58.120
<i>Enjoy your lunch.</i>

45:58.120 --> 46:01.120
<i>'This sweet taste
is too often denied us.</i>

46:01.120 --> 46:04.280
<i>'So just savour.'</i>
