09:28.118 --> 09:29.652
LET'S CUT THROUGH THE CRAP,
HAZEL.

09:29.685 --> 09:32.352
I KNOW HOW YOU THINK.
YOU LIE, YOU CHEAT.

09:32.385 --> 09:34.152
YOU MANIPULATE
TO GET WHAT YOU WANT.

09:34.185 --> 09:35.585
I'D ADMIRE YOU
IF YOU WEREN'T BRUNETTE.

09:35.618 --> 09:37.252
‐ I'M A NATURAL BLONDE.

09:37.285 --> 09:41.118
‐ THAT'S INSANE!

09:41.152 --> 09:43.585
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOUR ANGLE IS WITH KENNETH,

09:43.618 --> 09:45.152
BUT YOU LEAVE HIM OUT OF THIS.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.418
‐ I DON'T HAVE ANY ANGLE
WITH KENNETH, JENNA.

09:47.452 --> 09:49.318
I'VE ALREADY TAKEN CARE
OF HIM.

09:49.352 --> 09:50.752
‐ WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

09:50.785 --> 09:53.485
‐ NOTHING.

09:55.618 --> 09:57.485
STOP LOOKING AT MY ASS.

09:57.518 --> 10:00.452
‐ STOP POINTING YOUR ASS
AT MY EYEBALLS.

10:00.485 --> 10:02.985
‐ IT'S AN HONOR TO FINALLY
MEET YOU, QUESTLOVE.

10:03.018 --> 10:04.752
‐ TRACY,
THIS IS DR. CORNEL WEST.

10:04.785 --> 10:06.618
HE TEACHES AFRICAN‐AMERICAN
STUDIES

10:06.652 --> 10:07.818
AT PRINCETON.

10:07.852 --> 10:11.018
‐ YEAH, BROTHER WALTER AND
BROTHER WARREN AND I WERE OUT

10:11.052 --> 10:13.485
SEEING THE FIVE‐YEAR ENGAGEMENT
LAST NIGHT,

10:13.518 --> 10:15.385
AND THEY MENTIONED
YOUR CONCERNS

10:15.418 --> 10:18.185
ABOUT THE IMAGE YOU'RE
PRESENTING AS A BLACK MAN.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.685
‐ LOOK, I DON'T WANNA MAKE US
LOOK BAD,

10:19.718 --> 10:21.385
BUT THESE DUMB WHITE WRITERS

10:21.418 --> 10:23.152
DON'T KNOW HOW
US SOUL CATS SPEAK,

10:23.185 --> 10:25.418
ONE 'TWIXT THE OTHER.

10:25.452 --> 10:27.218
AND THEY KEEP BACKING UP THIS
TRUCK FULL OF MONEY

10:27.252 --> 10:28.418
FOR ME TO DO THIS CRAP.

10:28.452 --> 10:29.552
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

10:29.585 --> 10:31.052
‐ BEFORE YOU CHANGE
THE SYSTEM,

10:31.085 --> 10:33.452
YOU'VE GOT TO CHANGE YOURSELF,
BROTHER JORDAN.

10:33.485 --> 10:35.518
WHO WERE YOUR BLACK ROLE MODELS
GROWING UP?

10:35.552 --> 10:37.218
‐ DARTH VADER, NINJAS,

10:37.252 --> 10:39.752
SOME BLACK LICORICE I TRIED TO
MAKE INTO THE SHAPE OF MY DAD.

10:39.785 --> 10:41.485
‐ THAT'S THE CHALLENGE THERE.

10:41.518 --> 10:43.452
HOW ARE YOU GONNA BE
A BLACK ROLE MODEL

10:43.485 --> 10:45.052
WHEN YOU'VE NEVER HAD ONE?

10:45.085 --> 10:47.052
I'VE BEEN BLESSED TO HAVE
MOM AND DAD

10:47.085 --> 10:50.352
AND MY BROTHER CLIFF,
JOHN COLTRANE, CURTIS MAYFIELD,

10:50.385 --> 10:52.552
AND AS OF LAST NIGHT,
BROTHER JASON SEGEL.

10:52.585 --> 10:56.218
‐ SO I JUST NEED TO FIND
MY OWN ROLE MODEL TO INSPIRE ME.

10:56.252 --> 10:57.485
BUT WHERE SHOULD I LOOK?

10:57.518 --> 10:58.985
‐ MIGHT BE CLOSER
THAN YOU THINK.

10:59.018 --> 11:01.052
MAYBE RIGHT UNDER
YOUR OWN NOSE.

11:01.085 --> 11:03.218
‐ UNDER MY OWN NOSE.

11:03.252 --> 11:05.085
LIKE A MUSTACHE.

11:05.118 --> 11:06.352
A MUSTACHE.

11:06.385 --> 11:07.352
TOM SELLECK!

11:07.385 --> 11:11.152
‐ YOU'VE GOT TO GO
TO A CIVIL RIGHTS MUSEUM.

11:11.185 --> 11:12.652
I'M PRAYING FOR MY BROTHER.

11:16.585 --> 11:19.352
‐ EXCUSE ME.

11:19.385 --> 11:21.685
‐ DIANA! THE CEREMONY'S NOT
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

11:21.718 --> 11:24.152
YOU MIGHT WANNA PACE YOURSELF.

11:24.185 --> 11:25.318
‐ HEY, ARE YOU GONNA
DO THE PART

11:25.352 --> 11:28.385
WHERE YOU SAY, "SPEAK NOW
OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE"?

11:28.418 --> 11:30.152
‐ I WAS GONNA.
WHY?

11:30.185 --> 11:33.285
‐ THIS IS GONNA BE A MESS!

11:33.318 --> 11:34.618
‐ DIANA.

11:34.652 --> 11:37.985
‐ EXCUSE ME,
ARE YOU ELIZABETH LEMON?

11:38.018 --> 11:39.285
DURING THE CEREMONY,
ARE YOU GONNA DO THE WHOLE

11:39.318 --> 11:41.018
"SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER
HOLD YOUR PEACE" PART?

11:41.052 --> 11:43.018
‐ WAIT, WHAT?
WHY? WHO ARE YOU?

11:43.052 --> 11:45.552
‐ I'M SCOTT.
I WAS IN KOREA WITH AVERY.

11:45.585 --> 11:48.218
WE USED TO TAP MESSAGES
TO EACH OTHER DURING THE NEWS.

11:48.252 --> 11:49.618
ONE DAY WE MADE LOVE
WHILE TAPPING.

11:49.652 --> 11:51.518
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
NO BUTT STUFF.

11:51.552 --> 11:54.218
‐ NO, NO, NO. SCOTT, YOU DON'T
WANNA BREAK UP A MARRIAGE.

11:54.252 --> 11:55.418
‐ OH, I'M NOT MARRIED.

11:55.452 --> 11:56.985
BEFORE I GOT KIDNAPPED,

11:57.018 --> 11:58.418
TERESA AND I WERE ENGAGED
TO BE ENGAGED.

11:58.452 --> 12:01.052
‐ NO, JACK AND DIANA‐‐AVERY!
AVERY AND DIANA‐‐

12:01.085 --> 12:03.685
DAMN IT!
JACK AND NANCY.

12:03.718 --> 12:05.385
NO, DO NOT DO ANYTHING.

12:05.418 --> 12:07.418
‐ EXCUSE ME, LADY.

12:07.452 --> 12:08.985
YOU DO THE VOW?

12:09.018 --> 12:11.585
YOU KNOW, "SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER
HOLD YOUR PEACE" PART?

12:11.618 --> 12:13.052
‐ OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU‐‐

12:13.085 --> 12:15.285
‐ NO! I'M NOBODY!

12:15.318 --> 12:16.652
KIM JONG‐IL IS DEAD.

12:16.685 --> 12:18.485
I'M ONLY WAITER.

12:18.518 --> 12:21.718
I'M GREATEST WAITER
OF ALL TIME.

12:21.752 --> 12:24.685
‐ OKAY.

12:24.718 --> 12:26.085
OH, BOY.

12:37.231 --> 12:37.863
‐ HEY, GUYS!

12:37.863 --> 12:40.158
QUICK QUESTION ABOUT THE VOWS.

12:40.158 --> 12:42.892
THE WHOLE "SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER
HOLD YOUR PEACE" PART‐‐

12:42.925 --> 12:45.225
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED,
IT KINDA FEELS LIKE IT'S JUST...

12:45.258 --> 12:46.958
ASKING FOR TROUBLE.

12:46.992 --> 12:48.225
‐ LIZ, DO THE VOWS
AS WRITTEN.

12:48.258 --> 12:51.325
YES, THIS RELATIONSHIP
HAS BEEN TESTED.

12:51.358 --> 12:53.225
AND YET HERE WE ARE.

12:53.258 --> 12:56.258
‐ TO QUOTE GEORGE W. BUSH,
LEMON,

12:56.292 --> 12:57.258
"BRING 'EM ON."

12:57.292 --> 12:58.325
HE SAID THAT TO ME
IN GALVESTON

12:58.358 --> 12:59.992
WHEN A BUSLOAD
OF DRUNK DEBUTANTES

13:00.025 --> 13:01.258
TRIED TO GET ON HIS BOAT.

13:01.292 --> 13:03.225
IT WAS NAMED "MR. WATER BOAT."

13:03.258 --> 13:05.092
DID IT SINK?
YES.

13:05.125 --> 13:06.358
BECAUSE THERE WERE
TOO MANY PEOPLE ON IT.

13:06.392 --> 13:08.325
BUT THE SPIRIT OF HIS WORDS
LIVES ON.

13:08.358 --> 13:09.492
‐ OKAY, BUT ARE YOU SURE‐‐

13:09.525 --> 13:11.225
‐ I APPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERN, LEMON.

13:11.258 --> 13:14.158
BUT AVERY AND I DON'T QUIT.
EVER.

13:14.192 --> 13:16.425
‐ HELLO, KENNETH.

13:16.458 --> 13:18.392
HOW ARE THINGS
WITH YOUR NEW ROOMMATE?

13:18.425 --> 13:20.325
‐ OH, ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT HAZEL OR THE RACCOON

13:20.358 --> 13:21.892
THAT WON'T LET ME
INTO MY KITCHEN?

13:21.925 --> 13:23.458
EITHER WAY,
THE ANSWER IS "WONDERFUL."

13:23.492 --> 13:24.825
‐ I'M TALKING ABOUT HAZEL.

13:24.858 --> 13:26.392
I KNOW HOW SHE THINKS,
KENNETH.

13:26.425 --> 13:28.825
SO I WENT DOWN
TO HUMAN RESOURCES,

13:28.858 --> 13:30.458
TURNED ON THE OLD CHARM,

13:30.492 --> 13:32.458
AND GOT A COPY
OF THE APPLICATION

13:32.492 --> 13:34.725
YOU SUBMITTED
TO THE PAGE PROGRAM.

13:34.758 --> 13:39.192
‐ THIS ISN'T MY APPLICATION.

13:39.225 --> 13:41.192
THIS ISN'T EVEN
MY HANDWRITING.

13:41.225 --> 13:43.192
‐ DO YOU KNOW
WHOSE HANDWRITING IT IS?

13:43.225 --> 13:45.025
HAZEL'S.

13:45.058 --> 13:47.725
SHE SABOTAGED YOU
SO YOU WON'T BECOME A THREAT.

13:47.758 --> 13:51.125
‐ AND TO THINK I THOUGHT
HAZEL WAS A BITCH!

13:51.158 --> 13:54.492
FRIENDLY AND LOYAL
LIKE A WELL‐TRAINED FEMALE DOG.

13:54.525 --> 13:56.492
BUT SHE ISN'T A BITCH.

13:56.525 --> 13:59.158
SHE'S A MEANIEPANTS.

14:01.525 --> 14:03.858
‐ [sighs]
THIS IS GONNA BE A MESS.

14:03.892 --> 14:06.425
‐ POLICE ARE REPORTING
THAT A BANK ON JACKSON AVENUE

14:06.458 --> 14:08.425
WAS ROBBED THIS AFTERNOON
BY A LONE SUSPECT‐‐

14:08.458 --> 14:10.458
A WHITE MALE IN HIS 30s.

14:10.492 --> 14:12.825
SECURITY CAMERAS CAUGHT
THE GETAWAY VAN HEADING WEST

14:12.858 --> 14:13.825
TOWARDS MANHATTAN.

14:13.858 --> 14:15.492
‐ NERF‐HERDER!

14:15.525 --> 14:17.125
NERF‐HERDER!

14:17.158 --> 14:19.358
‐ OH, COME ON, TRAY.

14:19.392 --> 14:20.925
ARE YOU TELLING ME YOU HAVEN'T
FOUND ONE PERSON IN HERE

14:20.958 --> 14:22.258
WHO INSPIRES YOU?

14:22.292 --> 14:23.392
‐ WHAT ABOUT
FREDERICK DOUGLASS?

14:23.425 --> 14:25.825
‐ A GUY WITH TWO FIRST NAMES?
NEXT.

14:25.858 --> 14:28.358
‐ THAT DRESS BELONGED
TO ROSA PARKS.

14:28.392 --> 14:29.392
SHE'S ONE
OF MY PERSONAL HEROES.

14:29.425 --> 14:31.725
‐ I THINK I FOUND
MY ROLE MODEL.

14:31.758 --> 14:33.058
‐ GOOD CHOICE.

14:33.092 --> 14:33.992
SISTER PARKS ONCE SAID
EACH PERSON MUST LIVE THEIR LIFE

14:34.025 --> 14:36.092
AS A MODEL FOR OTHERS‐‐
‐ SHUT UP, DOTCOM.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.358
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT HER.

14:38.392 --> 14:40.392
I'M TALKING ABOUT ME LOOKING
FUNNY IN THIS REFLECTION.

14:40.425 --> 14:42.825
I'M GONNA DO A MOVIE WHERE
I PLAY SOMEONE'S FAT OLD AUNT

14:42.858 --> 14:45.458
AND I SAY STUFF LIKE,
"WHOO‐WEE!"

14:45.492 --> 14:48.425
AND "SWEET CHILD,
SIT YO' BLACK ASS DOWN!"

14:48.458 --> 14:51.358
‐ NO, TRAY, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID.

14:51.392 --> 14:53.758
‐ QUESTLOVE ASKED ME
TO FIND A ROLE MODEL.

14:53.792 --> 14:55.792
I DID.
IT'S TYLER PERRY.

14:55.825 --> 14:58.858
FROM NOW ON,
MY MOVIES WILL BE PRODUCED,

14:58.892 --> 15:00.992
WRITTEN, DIRECTED,
AND SEEN EXCLUSIVELY

15:01.025 --> 15:02.758
BY AFRICAN‐AMERICANS.

15:02.792 --> 15:04.258
THAT'S RIGHT.

15:04.292 --> 15:06.425
I'M STARTING MY OWN STUDIO.

15:08.525 --> 15:10.058
‐ HEY.
HEY, BEAUTIFUL!

15:10.092 --> 15:12.358
‐ YOU CAN'T GO TO PRISON,
YOU IDIOT.

15:12.392 --> 15:15.492
THEY WILL RAVAGE YOU
AND YOUR BEAUTIFUL WOMAN FACE.

15:15.525 --> 15:16.858
I'LL SAY I DID IT.

15:16.892 --> 15:18.192
I CAN HANDLE PRISON.

15:18.225 --> 15:19.958
I HAVE A MEAN FACE
AND I CAN WILL MYSELF TO SLEEP

15:19.992 --> 15:21.492
IN ANY ENVIRONMENT.

15:21.525 --> 15:23.158
‐ WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:23.192 --> 15:25.292
‐ THE HEIST.
THEY SAW YOUR VAN.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.358
WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE OUT
THE CAMERAS

15:27.392 --> 15:30.392
AND KILL ALL THE WITNESSES,
YOU BEAUTIFUL BASTARD?

15:30.425 --> 15:32.792
‐ I DIDN'T ROB A BANK, LIZ.
GOD!

15:32.825 --> 15:34.958
NO, I SOLD THE VAN
THIS MORNING...

15:34.992 --> 15:36.492
TO A REALLY NICE YOUNG GUY
ON METH.

15:36.525 --> 15:39.925
‐ YOU SOLD VAN DER BEEK?
FOR ME?

15:39.958 --> 15:43.492
‐ I SOLD VAN DER BEEK...
FOR US.

15:43.525 --> 15:45.458
I DON'T WANNA WAIT
FOR OUR LIVES TO BE OVER.

15:45.492 --> 15:48.758
AND NOW...
I CAN PAY TO REDO THE UPSTAIRS.

15:48.792 --> 15:51.925
‐ AND I WAS GONNA GO
TO PRISON FOR YOU.

15:51.958 --> 15:54.125
EVEN WHEN I THOUGHT
YOU HAD ROBBED A BANK,

15:54.158 --> 15:55.492
I WASN'T GONNA BAIL.

15:55.525 --> 15:57.025
I WON'T BAIL ON YOU!

15:57.058 --> 15:59.125
‐ YOU WON'T BAIL ON ME.

15:59.158 --> 16:00.725
YOU WON'T BAIL ON ME.

16:00.758 --> 16:01.725
‐ HAVE YOU EVER HAD
A GIRLFRIEND

16:01.758 --> 16:03.192
WILLING TO THELMA AND LOUISE
WITH YOU?

16:03.225 --> 16:04.958
‐ NO. NEVER.

16:04.992 --> 16:07.125
BUT COME ON, BONNIE AND CLYDE.
OKAY, I'M A BOY.

16:07.158 --> 16:12.392
I'M A BOY, LIZ.

16:12.425 --> 16:15.225
‐ ALSO, I HEAR PIPPA MIDDLETON
COULDN'T COME TODAY

16:15.258 --> 16:18.725
BECAUSE AVERY WAS BORROWING
HER ASS.

16:18.758 --> 16:22.192
‐ [laughs]

16:22.225 --> 16:24.492
‐ IF ANYONE CAN SHOW
JUST CAUSE

16:24.525 --> 16:28.158
WHY JACK AND AVERY MAY NOT
BE LAWFULLY JOINED TOGETHER,

16:28.192 --> 16:30.725
SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER
HOLD YOUR PEACE.

16:33.892 --> 16:35.725
‐ [groans]

16:35.758 --> 16:38.458
HEY, TERESA.

16:40.325 --> 16:43.358
‐ I JUST WANT ALEREEB
TO BE HAPPY.

16:46.892 --> 16:48.358
‐ KIM...

16:48.392 --> 16:49.758
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

16:49.792 --> 16:51.958
YOU'RE THE BEST WAITER
I'VE EVER SEEN.

16:51.992 --> 16:56.125
‐ I KNOW, MR. STEPANIAN.
I KNOW.

16:57.458 --> 16:59.392
‐ GREAT!
SO NO ONE.

16:59.425 --> 17:01.292
‐ ARE YOU PEOPLE KIDDING ME?

17:01.325 --> 17:03.092
‐ SERIOUSLY, NO ONE
HAS ANYTHING TO SAY?

17:03.125 --> 17:04.425
YOU'RE ALL COWARDS.

17:04.458 --> 17:07.292
‐ HE KISSED MY MOTHER.

17:07.325 --> 17:09.492
‐ AND SHE'S IN LOVE
WITH SCOTT.

17:09.525 --> 17:11.225
‐ [mouthing words]

17:11.258 --> 17:14.392
‐ HOW CAN YOU STAY SILENT WHEN
THERE'S SO MUCH TO OBJECT TO?

17:14.425 --> 17:15.992
WHAT KIND OF FRIENDS ARE YOU?

17:16.025 --> 17:18.458
‐ I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.

17:18.492 --> 17:20.758
I PLAYED AVERY JESSUP
IN "KIDNAPPED BY DANGER,"

17:20.792 --> 17:22.325
NOW AVAILABLE
ON SEGA GENESIS.

17:22.358 --> 17:23.592
THANK YOU!

17:23.625 --> 17:26.925
‐ I FORGOT ABOUT THE TV MOVIE
THAT WHITEWASHED OUR LOVE STORY.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.025
I WAS DATING ANOTHER WOMAN.

17:29.058 --> 17:30.892
‐ AND I WASN'T READY
TO GET MARRIED.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.458
both:
WE ONLY DID IT BECAUSE...

17:32.492 --> 17:37.841
‐ SHE WAS PREGNANT.
‐ I WAS PREGNANT.

17:38.977 --> 17:40.911
‐ YOU TRULY ARE
AN AMAZING WOMAN, AVERY.

17:40.911 --> 17:42.712
THE ONLY THING YOU'RE BAD AT
IS QUITTING.

17:42.712 --> 17:44.646
‐ I KEPT MY SEA MONKEYS ALIVE
FOR 30 YEARS.

17:44.646 --> 17:46.246
‐ WE'RE BOTH INCAPABLE
OF FAILURE,

17:46.279 --> 17:47.579
SO DEEP DOWN WE WERE HOPING

17:47.613 --> 17:49.346
SOMEONE ELSE
WOULD RUIN IT FOR US.

17:49.379 --> 17:51.446
‐ I MEAN, IF WE WANTED
THIS THING TO SUCCEED,

17:51.479 --> 17:53.546
WHY WOULD WE ASK LIZ
TO OFFICIATE?

17:53.579 --> 17:55.879
‐ BECAUSE I'M GOOD
AT BLENDING HUMOR AND HEART?

17:57.013 --> 17:58.846
‐ I'LL ALWAYS CARE FOR YOU.

17:58.879 --> 18:01.413
‐ WE'LL SPLIT ASSETS
IN CUSTODY EQUALLY.

18:01.446 --> 18:03.346
I'LL TAKE OUR FRIENDS
"A" THROUGH "L."

18:03.379 --> 18:04.979
YOU'LL GET "M" THROUGH "Z."

18:05.013 --> 18:07.846
LIZ, DIVORCE US.

18:07.879 --> 18:10.213
‐ BY THE POWER VESTED IN ME

18:10.246 --> 18:14.146
BY THE WEBSITE
INSTAMINISTER.ESTONIA,

18:14.179 --> 18:16.979
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
DIVORCED.

18:19.479 --> 18:22.613
‐ [laughing] YEAH!
DIVORCE!

18:22.646 --> 18:25.013
WHOO!
[chuckling]

18:25.046 --> 18:26.946
[applause]

18:29.546 --> 18:31.246
[door closes]

18:31.279 --> 18:33.513
‐ I THOUGHT
YOU WERE MY FRIEND.

18:33.546 --> 18:36.146
BUT YOU WERE TRYING
TO DESTROY ME THE WHOLE TIME.

18:36.179 --> 18:40.246
‐ IT STARTED THAT WAY.

18:40.279 --> 18:43.279
BUT THEN I FELL IN LOVE
WITH YOU.

18:43.313 --> 18:45.479
‐ ALL YOU'VE DONE
IS LIE TO ME.

18:45.513 --> 18:46.846
HOW CAN I BELIEVE YOU NOW?

18:46.879 --> 18:49.879
‐ BELIEVE THIS.

18:49.913 --> 18:51.613
MMM!
AH!

18:51.646 --> 18:54.879
‐ DON'T YOU EVER
DO THAT AGAIN.

18:56.379 --> 19:00.913
[both moaning]

19:03.913 --> 19:07.846
‐ THIS WOULD MAKE A GREAT ROOM
FOR A BABY.

19:07.879 --> 19:10.613
‐ YOU SAID, "BABY,"
INSTEAD OF "PLANT."

19:10.646 --> 19:12.179
NOW SAY, "MAN CAVE."

19:12.213 --> 19:15.079
‐ NEVER!
[doorbell]

19:17.579 --> 19:19.146
WOW.

19:19.179 --> 19:21.613
DIDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.

19:21.646 --> 19:22.846
‐ IN ALL THE COMMOTION,

19:22.879 --> 19:23.713
I FORGOT TO GIVE YOU
THIS LITTLE...

19:23.746 --> 19:27.079
THANK YOU FOR OFFICIATING
OUR EVENT.

19:32.913 --> 19:36.213
IT'S THE REMOTE CONTROL
HOLDER YOU WANTED FROM SKYMALL.

19:36.246 --> 19:38.546
‐ YES! YES!
AWESOME!

19:38.579 --> 19:40.613
AH!

19:40.646 --> 19:43.446
OHH...
[tools whirring]

19:43.479 --> 19:47.279
OH, CRISS IS DOING
A LITTLE RENOVATING UPSTAIRS...

19:47.313 --> 19:50.079
BECAUSE WE ARE THINKING
ABOUT HAVING A BABY...

19:50.113 --> 19:51.513
TOGETHER...

19:51.546 --> 19:55.479
THAT WILL EMERGE
FROM MY VAGINA.

19:55.513 --> 19:57.846
OR A CHINESE VAGINA.

19:57.879 --> 20:00.113
‐ OKAY.

20:00.146 --> 20:02.346
I'LL SEE YOU AT WORK TOMORROW.

20:02.379 --> 20:03.546
‐ WAIT, THAT'S IT?

20:03.579 --> 20:05.346
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GIVE ME
ANY ADVICE?

20:05.379 --> 20:08.379
‐ I CAN'T, LEMON.
I DON'T HAVE ANY RIGHT TO.

20:08.413 --> 20:09.879
I'VE BEEN, UH...

20:09.913 --> 20:12.546
DIVORCED...TWICE.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.013
ENGAGED TWO OTHER TIMES.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.546
I'M...A MESS.

20:15.579 --> 20:18.213
BUT ANY CHILD WOULD BE LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU

20:18.246 --> 20:20.846
BE THE MOTHER IT LOVES
THEN HATES FOR A FEW YEARS,

20:20.879 --> 20:22.279
THEN LOVES AGAIN,

20:22.313 --> 20:24.046
THEN HALF‐HEARTEDLY DEFENDS
TO ITS SPOUSE,

20:24.079 --> 20:26.579
THEN PUTS IN A HOME.

20:26.613 --> 20:28.979
YOU DON'T NEED MY ADVICE.

20:29.013 --> 20:31.879
‐ BUT I STILL WANT IT.

20:31.913 --> 20:33.546
‐ IF YOU DECIDE
TO HAVE CHILD,

20:33.579 --> 20:37.913
YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE
AN EXCELLENT MOTHER...

20:37.946 --> 20:39.546
AS LONG AS YOU FOLLOW
JACK DONAGHY'S

20:39.579 --> 20:41.946
25 PILLARS OF MOTHERHOOD.

20:41.979 --> 20:44.146
NUMBER ONE,
DON'T OVERTHINK THE NAMES.

20:44.179 --> 20:46.846
STICK TO KINGS AND QUEENS
OF ENGLAND.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.879
THERE WILL NEVER BE
A PRESIDENT ASHTON

20:48.913 --> 20:51.546
OR A DR. KATNISS.

20:51.579 --> 20:57.213
OR A NON‐SEXUALLY CONFUSED
LORNE.

21:04.202 --> 21:06.802
‐ [laughs]

21:06.835 --> 21:11.706
AH, WE HAD A GOOD TIME
TONIGHT.

21:11.706 --> 21:14.868
I WONDER WHAT WILL HAPPEN
TO THE GANG NEXT SEASON.

21:14.868 --> 21:16.834
WILL LIZ HAVE A BABY?

21:16.868 --> 21:19.934
WILL JACK BECOME SUPREME LEADER
OF KABLETOWN?

21:19.968 --> 21:21.134
WILL KENNETH‐‐

21:21.168 --> 21:23.568
NO, I DON'T CARE!

21:23.601 --> 21:26.304
ALL I WANT IS JACK AND LIZ
GET TOGETHER.

21:26.304 --> 21:29.067
ON FRIENDS,
IT WAS SO SATISFYING.

21:29.067 --> 21:32.465
THEY DO ON CHEERS,
THEY DO ON MOONLIGHTING.

21:32.465 --> 21:33.752
EVERYBODY DO IT!

21:33.752 --> 21:35.770
DON'T OVERTHINK IT, WRITERS.

21:35.770 --> 21:37.469
WHOEVER YOU ARE.
