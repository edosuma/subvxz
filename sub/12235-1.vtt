00:44.820 --> 00:49.231
COMMUNION

01:31.068 --> 01:32.563
Someone is here.

01:34.313 --> 01:35.370
Mm...

01:38.578 --> 01:41.167
Darling...
Come.

02:16.923 --> 02:18.708
Knock-knock.

02:21.515 --> 02:23.994
She says... he says...

02:24.578 --> 02:26.510
I like this. OK.

02:26.546 --> 02:29.354
Really, because, you know, I like
a "knock-knock" joking.

02:29.572 --> 02:30.447
You can do...

02:31.067 --> 02:33.364
I can do "knock-knock" jokes.

02:51.446 --> 02:56.987
<i>Based on the true experiences
of one American family.</i>

03:01.909 --> 03:06.174
New York, 1985.

03:24.219 --> 03:25.131
Download.

03:29.810 --> 03:30.782
Get up!

03:31.016 --> 03:32.793
I'm cookin', I'm cookin'...

03:32.960 --> 03:33.965
I'm on the roll.

03:34.133 --> 03:36.512
What's the matter with you?

03:36.713 --> 03:37.517
Boom!

03:41.773 --> 03:42.879
Where is dad?

03:43.046 --> 03:45.057
I don't know, office maybe...

03:46.866 --> 03:49.882
- Whitley!
- Oh, now I have you.

03:50.016 --> 03:51.692
I got you! Got you, baby!

03:51.960 --> 03:54.305
What's the problem, the computer or you?

03:54.909 --> 03:58.360
Today it was everything, I tell you.
It was full scale revolution, total war.

03:58.393 --> 03:59.566
Give me your jacket.

03:59.902 --> 04:02.985
Terrible day.
What a day, what a day, what a schmear.

04:03.420 --> 04:05.229
Hey hey, what's the matter?
Give me a kiss!

04:05.296 --> 04:06.771
There is something wrong with you?

04:09.719 --> 04:10.993
I had such a terrible day.

04:11.026 --> 04:13.205
First the computer turns off,

04:13.305 --> 04:16.408
then the wolf painting jumps off the wall.

04:16.742 --> 04:19.043
It attacks me without provocation.

04:19.077 --> 04:21.846
Then your mother calls, the toilet explodes.

04:21.913 --> 04:24.882
The duck I'm cooking tries to tell me
how to live my life.

04:25.049 --> 04:28.385
The computer completely erased itself
when it turned off.

04:28.418 --> 04:32.656
No wonder that I can't write my great
American novel.

04:33.990 --> 04:37.694
Does this mean you're too tired
to go to the country?

04:38.227 --> 04:40.263
No, it doesn't mean that.

04:41.530 --> 04:43.099
What did you lose?

04:43.399 --> 04:45.167
I lost... you know, I lost another day,

04:45.201 --> 04:48.804
what I lost was gold,
golden notions erased, smoked dreams,

04:48.837 --> 04:51.306
phantoms...
What I crave is... you know

04:51.941 --> 04:53.342
...consolation.

04:57.746 --> 04:58.914
Oh, brother...

05:00.148 --> 05:03.351
You know, it could be the computer
turned off for a reason.

05:04.752 --> 05:05.953
Why would that be?

05:06.354 --> 05:07.455
It could be...

05:09.757 --> 05:12.026
I felt that the book I'm...

05:12.260 --> 05:14.061
working on is no good.

05:14.195 --> 05:16.230
What? Why you do that to yourself?

05:16.797 --> 05:18.499
It was a rotten accident.

05:22.969 --> 05:25.572
- Once the duck...
- We'll get to go down the fire escape?

05:25.771 --> 05:28.106
Not again...
This one is bad.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.541
- Give me something.
- Here, here.

05:29.708 --> 05:31.777
- Just give me something.
- You're gonna need some water.

05:31.910 --> 05:34.245
Give me... something to put on it.

05:35.313 --> 05:36.748
I need to turn it off.

05:37.382 --> 05:41.353
What the code is?
664... 6664...?

05:41.653 --> 05:43.954
- It's 18-57
- Don't... don't... don't...! Please!

05:44.055 --> 05:46.056
The year we were married.

05:46.289 --> 05:49.058
Don't... The red light is on!
Oh no...

05:49.225 --> 05:50.960
Remember what happened last time.

05:50.994 --> 05:52.695
Oh God... will you get the door?

05:54.463 --> 05:56.331
I'm sorry, we get...
we get the little...

05:56.698 --> 05:59.299
- ...small catastrophe.
- Geez. Are you ok?

05:59.533 --> 06:00.501
Honey...

06:00.967 --> 06:02.335
What's the matter?

06:03.469 --> 06:05.537
What isn't the matter,
will you look at this?

06:06.405 --> 06:08.073
Open the window.

06:08.340 --> 06:09.441
Give me that.

06:10.341 --> 06:11.876
Get some air in here.

06:12.777 --> 06:14.545
Could you save me? I married this.

06:15.345 --> 06:17.413
Open the window over there, please!

06:17.446 --> 06:19.048
- Put it over your face.
- Thank you.

06:19.081 --> 06:20.249
Breath shallowly.

06:20.282 --> 06:21.850
We are not going to the country,
right?

06:21.883 --> 06:25.820
No, we're going to the country. No problem.
This is all part of the plan...

06:26.888 --> 06:28.120
I know, the last time...

06:28.221 --> 06:29.822
- That's it, heh?
- That's it.

06:29.889 --> 06:30.689
Hi, Al.

06:30.755 --> 06:33.824
- That's the fire?
- It's just food. Food.

06:35.226 --> 06:36.360
The duck.

06:36.627 --> 06:37.528
Really?

06:38.995 --> 06:40.630
That worked to burn the duck.

06:40.797 --> 06:43.566
891 Feetstreet...

06:43.966 --> 06:47.769
- It shouldn't happen...
- ...23, repeat, is a 23.

06:48.869 --> 06:51.705
- You've been warned before.
- I know. I'm sorry.

06:51.805 --> 06:54.140
You'll receive your summons
in the mail.

06:54.274 --> 06:56.542
- This stuff is so sensitive...
- 200 dollars.

06:56.643 --> 06:58.310
No, stop!

06:58.410 --> 06:59.645
New policy.

07:00.145 --> 07:02.347
It just goes off, I don't know what happened...
Thank you.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.115
- Back to the station!
- Thank you!

07:06.416 --> 07:08.451
Let your wife cook.

07:51.550 --> 07:54.552
Dad, turn this thing off!

08:00.524 --> 08:02.592
Turn it off, Dad.

08:05.160 --> 08:08.896
3-9-27-81,
I know what it is.

08:09.863 --> 08:13.500
It's a geometric, not arithmetical.

08:13.966 --> 08:16.569
- It's your birthday? You just repress it.
- It also does not work.

08:17.169 --> 08:18.737
You've never had that alarm here before.

08:18.904 --> 08:22.707
Ah, you see? You see?
Anne knows how to make it work.

08:23.341 --> 08:25.342
Just read the instruction.

08:46.924 --> 08:48.192
Dad...?

08:49.660 --> 08:50.627
Dad?

08:54.864 --> 08:55.731
Dad!

08:57.933 --> 08:58.600
Dad!

08:58.766 --> 09:00.734
- What's up?
- Spider!

09:00.902 --> 09:01.535
What?!

09:01.835 --> 09:02.603
Aaah!

09:04.237 --> 09:05.705
Go on, kill it!

09:05.806 --> 09:06.939
Kill it!

09:07.940 --> 09:10.409
- Oh, that is a big one.
- Here it is, here it is.

09:12.377 --> 09:14.478
Now it's in your pants!

09:15.379 --> 09:17.081
Alex, do something!

09:18.415 --> 09:21.484
Now it's on you!

09:21.617 --> 09:23.652
Just a peaceful night in the country.

09:23.685 --> 09:25.821
There it going to sleep now, with you.

09:25.887 --> 09:27.421
Will sing to you.

09:27.589 --> 09:31.858
If you leave the room and you come
right back in, usually it's gone.

09:33.660 --> 09:34.761
I'm glad...

09:35.194 --> 09:38.031
that this is not my room.

09:40.300 --> 09:41.868
Have a nice night.

09:43.803 --> 09:44.771
You know...

09:45.639 --> 09:49.243
...it might not have been...
a spider I saw.

09:55.550 --> 09:57.352
Say something dirty.

09:57.385 --> 09:58.753
- Socks.
- Come on...

09:58.786 --> 10:01.489
Say... say erect...
Can you say: erection?

10:01.657 --> 10:02.891
I'll never say it!

10:07.329 --> 10:09.766
What do you think he's doing?
Alex?

10:09.799 --> 10:10.766
What do you mean
what I think he's doing?

10:10.800 --> 10:11.567
I know what he's doing.

10:11.601 --> 10:13.937
He's doing the old Romanian turn on,
he's saying:

10:14.104 --> 10:15.738
I see ghosts of wolves.

10:15.906 --> 10:21.245
I see ghosts of wolves that "huuum".
You know I see the dark beautiful forests...

10:21.278 --> 10:23.280
And she's like this...
She's like this.

10:25.449 --> 10:28.252
And at night there would be
only silence.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.955
And I shall hear the wolves.

10:33.358 --> 10:35.093
But there are no wolves here.

10:40.265 --> 10:42.634
I wonder if there are ghosts.

10:44.136 --> 10:45.975
The house is new.

10:46.208 --> 10:48.849
No, I mean the ghosts of the wolves.

10:50.253 --> 10:52.359
The ones that have been killed.

10:58.377 --> 10:59.413
Stop it.

11:00.817 --> 11:02.823
No, quiet, quiet...

11:07.703 --> 11:09.676
So, you wanna fool around?

11:10.077 --> 11:11.749
- You look good.
- Thanks.

11:12.284 --> 11:14.356
It's been an ice age,
I've missed you...

11:14.390 --> 11:16.997
...you old ball and chain.

12:52.203 --> 12:53.540
Is that someone there?

14:58.364 --> 14:59.601
Hey, hey, wow...

14:59.768 --> 15:01.406
What's the matter, boss?
What's the matter?

15:01.573 --> 15:03.578
- There was something here!
- Shake it up, come on.

15:03.746 --> 15:04.582
Something very bad!

15:04.749 --> 15:06.889
Wow, it was the nightmare.
What are you talking about?

15:07.056 --> 15:08.660
No, no dad.

15:13.341 --> 15:15.948
- It was the nightmare.
- They had me, dad.

15:16.115 --> 15:18.456
Nightmares do that.
You know, sometimes, I mean...

15:18.622 --> 15:23.670
If it didn't do that, that wouldn't be
a nightmare... You know what I mean?

15:23.737 --> 15:26.311
Daddies... daddies get the boys back, right?

15:26.612 --> 15:27.581
Yeah...

15:27.648 --> 15:29.320
Do you know any songs?

15:30.624 --> 15:32.930
Do you know any Indian hunting songs?

15:35.705 --> 15:37.911
Do you know the old buffalo hunting song?

15:49.844 --> 15:53.555
...and cocktails for two.

15:55.929 --> 15:57.533
That's a good boy.
Go to sleep.

15:58.569 --> 16:01.444
He was yelling, you didn't hear him,
he was yelling.

16:01.645 --> 16:04.387
- You were yelling? Where was I?
- He had some bad dream, I tell you.

16:04.554 --> 16:06.359
I had a bad dream too.

16:08.365 --> 16:11.072
I was so sound asleep...
I... I was asleep.

16:11.239 --> 16:13.847
You were out. Like a log.

16:15.719 --> 16:19.664
He said something was after him, some spider, huh?
Like a spider from last night?

16:20.198 --> 16:22.304
It was real, dad.

16:23.641 --> 16:25.280
Worst dream you ever had.

16:25.581 --> 16:27.519
It wasn't a dream.

16:29.091 --> 16:31.063
I'm not surprised about you, Whit.

16:31.431 --> 16:35.141
You ate your way through this...
table last night.

16:35.309 --> 16:37.314
I didn't think he could get up the stairs.

16:37.716 --> 16:39.287
That's a good thing it was nothing.
No wonder...

16:39.321 --> 16:43.433
I pay fortune for this equipment.
Some animal must have set it off.

16:44.569 --> 16:45.572
How did you sleep?

16:47.577 --> 16:48.213
Well...

16:48.513 --> 16:50.821
We saw lots of lights last night.

16:52.356 --> 16:54.530
Whitley has that machine finely tuned.

16:55.867 --> 16:57.205
A mosquito could set it off.

16:57.271 --> 16:59.678
No, really there were lots of lights,
it was very hard to sleep.

16:59.845 --> 17:01.349
A chipmunk couldn't set that thing off.

17:01.517 --> 17:03.589
It's been the light from the bathroom.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.297
No, it was light there came in
from outside.

17:06.364 --> 17:09.339
I can't believe you didn't see it,
it was like day.

17:09.507 --> 17:11.713
I thought there was a fire outside,
in fact.

17:11.880 --> 17:15.892
I came downstairs, you know...
there was light... it was this light.

17:16.460 --> 17:18.766
But then... it must...

17:21.205 --> 17:24.819
The flood lights went on, I don't know...
it was the moon maybe.

17:26.159 --> 17:28.573
We were all dreaming,
you know, and the moon...

17:28.673 --> 17:30.673
we all got involved in the same dream.

17:32.343 --> 17:34.416
It wasn't the moon.

17:34.852 --> 17:36.889
So it was a dream.

17:37.058 --> 17:40.099
This whole place was flooded
with light from above.

17:40.266 --> 17:42.104
It wasn't a dream.

17:42.237 --> 17:43.508
So it was the moon.

17:44.043 --> 17:45.681
No, it wasn't the moon.

17:46.048 --> 17:48.856
And it wasn't a dream.
I'm telling you what we saw.

17:57.413 --> 17:58.249
Well...

18:02.026 --> 18:07.171
So, why don't you have your usual huge
portion of... banana cakes?

18:09.350 --> 18:11.494
Aromatic compounds...

18:14.824 --> 18:17.463
- Don't do this to me.
- Aromatic compounds of perfumes.

18:17.760 --> 18:20.728
- No, no, no!
- 1,2,3,4,5,6.

18:20.893 --> 18:22.641
OK. I want to go home.

18:23.399 --> 18:26.467
I'm sorry, I'm not angry.
I can't explain.

18:27.489 --> 18:29.402
Whitley, I want you to take us back today.

18:29.666 --> 18:31.842
Come on, Alex.
Give me a break.

18:32.337 --> 18:34.151
I know I did not see the moon.

18:34.678 --> 18:35.965
I want to go home.

18:36.558 --> 18:39.197
Alex, what's the four letter word,
for an odour...

18:39.362 --> 18:41.340
Take us home, Whitley!

18:44.671 --> 18:46.123
Please, forgive me.

18:46.815 --> 18:47.969
It's cool.

18:49.426 --> 18:51.834
Would you... clean up, then we'll go.

18:51.998 --> 18:54.010
We had a really rough night.

18:54.175 --> 18:56.351
- Are you kidding?
- What's going on?

19:06.080 --> 19:08.587
I don't know why we're doing this.
Why...

19:10.894 --> 19:12.445
It's crazy. You know.

19:16.699 --> 19:18.381
Thank you for taking us home.

19:19.634 --> 19:20.660
It's fine.

19:21.207 --> 19:23.601
We could have taken the bus, Whitley.
Really.

19:23.841 --> 19:25.550
There is no bus.

19:26.269 --> 19:28.299
There is not even a bus station.

20:00.898 --> 20:03.398
This is gonna be so terrible.

20:04.498 --> 20:06.998
Another day down the toilet.

20:07.098 --> 20:11.098
What are you doing, Whitley?

20:11.198 --> 20:12.698
Is your video on?

20:12.798 --> 20:15.798
Are you wasting time again, you devil?

20:22.898 --> 20:24.398
Anybody seen Andy?

20:50.398 --> 20:51.898
What's going on?

20:51.998 --> 20:53.498
Had a good time?

20:54.298 --> 20:55.798
It was okay.

20:57.398 --> 20:59.398
Did someone say something to you?

20:59.498 --> 21:00.498
No.

21:00.598 --> 21:01.597
Get you into a fight?

21:01.697 --> 21:02.697
No.

21:02.797 --> 21:04.297
Is that Andy in there?

21:04.397 --> 21:05.897
Oh yeah.

21:06.497 --> 21:08.997
Thought I was talking to a pirate.

21:09.897 --> 21:11.397
Everyone like your teeth?

21:14.997 --> 21:17.497
I don't like the space ship anymore.

21:17.597 --> 21:19.097
It's ugly.

21:20.249 --> 21:25.008
There were wolves in the closet, wolves
in the basement, wolves all over the place.

21:26.373 --> 21:29.735
They work in advertising, they sell
junk food and beer.

21:30.135 --> 21:33.663
They eat gigantic hamburgers,
and they drink cold beers,

21:33.829 --> 21:37.491
for the baseball games on the TV,
and the bags of the potato chips,

21:37.657 --> 21:40.519
which are big enough to feed a horse.

21:41.218 --> 21:42.450
They have a lot of fun.

21:42.616 --> 21:44.414
There go the baseball games.
They have a hack of

21:44.580 --> 21:45.711
Get dressed!

21:45.878 --> 21:47.675
I don't feel like it, go with someone else.

21:47.709 --> 21:49.539
I'm old. I'll probably get hurt.

21:50.072 --> 21:53.067
Come on, come on! We've got ten minutes
to be over at Greenberg's. Andy's waiting.

21:53.367 --> 21:57.128
Crack the whip.
Drive the slaves off to another cocktail party.

21:57.627 --> 22:01.455
Make them babble about Glasnost.
I've lost another day here.

22:01.621 --> 22:04.054
He needs you.
He's over sensitive today.

22:04.120 --> 22:05.386
He's in a funny mood.

22:05.953 --> 22:06.952
What's the matter?

22:07.120 --> 22:08.353
I don't know. He...

22:08.519 --> 22:11.752
He overreacted this morning at school.
He won't talk to me, I'm a girl.

22:11.918 --> 22:13.585
Here, put this on...

22:14.585 --> 22:16.218
take this off...

22:17.518 --> 22:20.017
You're going as an elephant.
You promised him.

22:22.350 --> 22:23.917
Is this the front...?

22:24.517 --> 22:26.050
-... or the rear?
- I don't know.

22:27.182 --> 22:30.282
Will you put your grey turtleneck on.
Elephants are grey.

22:31.349 --> 22:33.782
- Put your pants on, come on, let's go.
- It's me!

22:34.114 --> 22:35.015
Come on.

22:44.479 --> 22:46.846
OK, OK, it's just about that time.

22:48.846 --> 22:50.579
The queen is speaking...

22:53.412 --> 22:57.211
OK! Remember! Only treats, no tricks.

22:57.378 --> 22:58.411
Yeah!

22:59.844 --> 23:04.110
Get your bags to the door!
God help the rest of the building.

23:15.273 --> 23:17.540
Come on, Dad. You can come with me.

23:22.072 --> 23:24.039
- Bye bye!
- Bye!

23:26.038 --> 23:27.872
Don't let anybody step on you.

23:29.971 --> 23:32.404
- Thanks a lot, Jake. Sorry about the mess.
- You're welcome.

23:32.571 --> 23:33.970
You can take off the nose.

23:34.137 --> 23:37.336
What's the matter, you don't like my nose?
How come I can't have any fun?

23:37.836 --> 23:40.236
The other dads have noses.

23:40.436 --> 23:41.903
- Put this on ice.
- OK.

23:42.735 --> 23:44.302
You can use this, it's clean.

23:44.335 --> 23:45.269
Take care, guys...

23:45.335 --> 23:46.468
- See you later.
- All right.

23:46.634 --> 23:47.768
Come on! Let's go to work!

23:47.934 --> 23:49.967
- You're sure you've not blown this?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:50.801 --> 23:53.001
Bye guys, see you later!

23:53.734 --> 23:56.400
Don't be afraid.
I'm starting to get scared.

23:57.966 --> 23:59.699
I'm starting to get scared now...

24:01.432 --> 24:02.599
Which way in there?

24:08.830 --> 24:11.196
I think we're expected to go down there.

24:16.829 --> 24:17.795
Zoom...

24:59.988 --> 25:01.521
Trick or treat...?

25:06.987 --> 25:08.020
Get away!

25:08.620 --> 25:10.553
What... what you... what you...!

25:11.585 --> 25:12.485
Stay away from me!

25:12.651 --> 25:13.785
No more!

25:14.484 --> 25:16.217
- Are you crazy?
- What's going on?

25:16.384 --> 25:17.584
What's that suppose to mean?

25:17.651 --> 25:19.550
It's the Halloween show.

25:21.550 --> 25:23.616
What's the matter with you?
A grown man getting hysterical

25:23.716 --> 25:25.216
over a thirteen year old
girl in a Halloween costume.

25:25.282 --> 25:26.216
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

25:26.382 --> 25:27.682
Please, leave us alone.

25:38.114 --> 25:40.013
Am I in the dog house or what?

25:44.979 --> 25:46.712
Andy, say good night to a father.

25:51.211 --> 25:55.111
I'm gonna put our son to bed
and then we're going to talk.

25:55.411 --> 25:57.877
- Oh, wonderful.
- No, it won't be wonderful.

25:58.410 --> 25:59.643
But it's needed.

26:03.076 --> 26:04.676
That guy went crazy.

26:07.142 --> 26:08.542
Not my fault.

26:13.473 --> 26:14.359
Here we go.

26:16.436 --> 26:17.867
How old are you?

26:18.241 --> 26:20.046
I overreacted.

26:20.625 --> 26:22.601
What's going on Whitley?
What's happening?

26:23.725 --> 26:25.462
- What's happen to you...
- I got scared.

26:27.300 --> 26:28.905
What do you take me for?

26:29.339 --> 26:31.445
What do you think,
I don't know what you do?

26:33.985 --> 26:35.856
You're having problems with your writing?

26:36.024 --> 26:38.230
So fine,
you terrified our son tonight.

26:38.397 --> 26:40.536
I scared myself too.

26:41.372 --> 26:43.176
You were frightened
by a Halloween mask.

26:43.343 --> 26:44.579
Mhm. Yes.

26:45.248 --> 26:47.220
A Halloween mask frightened you.

26:48.322 --> 26:49.559
Is there an echo?

26:50.194 --> 26:50.997
Yes.

26:52.534 --> 26:54.472
What am I supposed to say to that?
What am I...

26:55.040 --> 26:56.043
I don't know.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.958
Why would you be frightened
of a rubber mask?

27:02.158 --> 27:03.662
It's like I'd seen it.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.138
Alive... real.

27:09.575 --> 27:11.312
Whitley don't do this to me.

27:12.481 --> 27:13.918
Peng, zoom.

27:15.254 --> 27:17.960
I've got one child.
I don't need another.

27:18.127 --> 27:19.230
You're right.

27:19.764 --> 27:22.303
You don't say anything more about it,
I won't.

27:50.836 --> 27:54.893
This time something was here.
I'm sure.

28:00.855 --> 28:02.924
We're alone.

28:13.862 --> 28:16.310
- What you're doing?
- Same old thing.

28:17.978 --> 28:19.239
Been working?

28:20.277 --> 28:22.205
I got no ideas.

28:23.726 --> 28:26.581
God, but this place is a mess.
How could you work here.

28:26.767 --> 28:29.400
- I will clean it.
- Leave it that way. I like it that way.

28:29.585 --> 28:33.220
I like my work place... crossed.

28:33.554 --> 28:35.965
I told you, don't touch my stuff!

28:37.153 --> 28:39.733
You know, you used to be funny.

28:42.933 --> 28:44.933
I used to get employed.

28:45.033 --> 28:46.533
I used to be able to write.

28:46.633 --> 28:49.133
I used to be able to do a lot of things.

28:49.233 --> 28:51.233
Oh my God.

28:52.333 --> 28:53.833
Whit, what are you doing?

28:58.533 --> 28:59.533
Hm?

29:01.633 --> 29:03.133
I used to be fine.

29:03.233 --> 29:04.733
I used to be able to focus.

29:04.833 --> 29:06.333
I... I can't do anything.

29:07.133 --> 29:11.133
It's like I can't see anything
but the inside of my own head.

29:18.433 --> 29:21.432
You're not gonna... do anything?

29:38.332 --> 29:40.332
Anything I can do?

29:45.988 --> 29:50.013
Welcome to the Saint Mark's Church School
second grade rumble.

29:50.516 --> 29:53.702
<i>Dance, dance, wherever you may be</i>

29:54.339 --> 29:57.961
<i>For I am the Lord of the Dance said he</i>

29:58.129 --> 30:01.852
<i>And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be</i>

30:02.020 --> 30:05.909
<i>And I'll lead you all in the Dance said He.</i>

30:06.714 --> 30:09.767
<i>Dance, dance, wherever you may be</i>

30:10.103 --> 30:13.724
<i>For I am the Lord of the Dance said he</i>

30:13.959 --> 30:17.615
<i>And I'll lead you all, wherever you may be</i>

30:17.782 --> 30:22.042
<i>And I'll lead you all in the Dance said He.</i>

30:34.953 --> 30:36.422
Andrew, that was wonderful.

30:36.689 --> 30:38.460
- Thanks a lot, guy.
- That was really wonderful.

30:38.627 --> 30:41.265
That's why I call dishing out
some Christmas spirit.

30:43.770 --> 30:45.306
Why are we sad?

30:46.175 --> 30:47.577
Andy, what a thing to say.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.049
We are.

30:50.383 --> 30:51.953
We just had a great time.

30:52.454 --> 30:54.558
But... dad's sad.

30:57.229 --> 31:00.803
I'm having a tough time, you know,
with my writing...

31:02.072 --> 31:05.579
I wanna have fun.
Santa's coming in just a few days?

31:05.680 --> 31:09.487
That's right, Santa is coming and,
you know, it's gonna be great.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.751
Not too fast!
Don't try to do...

31:30.928 --> 31:34.334
- All right?
- Yeah, I think so.

31:35.069 --> 31:40.880
I asked Santa for professional model,
he sure gave me a professional model all right.

31:41.214 --> 31:42.483
Santa knows.

31:42.550 --> 31:46.658
I think Santa knows just
about everything, don't you, dad?

31:51.768 --> 31:54.206
Place one on a tower.

31:56.043 --> 31:59.449
- Put one post on...
- Don't lose it, dad.

32:02.789 --> 32:04.359
Slide cargo mover...

32:05.962 --> 32:07.932
all the way toward...

32:21.223 --> 32:22.963
Who writes this?

32:23.697 --> 32:25.349
Take off your clothes.

32:25.483 --> 32:28.475
Let's go on to another room and do it.

32:55.375 --> 32:58.375
You know, I think I got
a new dad for Christmas.

32:58.475 --> 33:01.975
I'm the same old, you know,
doodad.

33:03.475 --> 33:06.475
I mean like you were
before you got sad.

33:09.375 --> 33:11.375
Pretty great Christmas, Santa.

33:11.475 --> 33:12.975
You did everything.

33:15.375 --> 33:17.375
You bought the bike.

33:19.275 --> 33:22.275
Yes, Santa.
You bought the bike.

34:26.302 --> 34:28.225
Is that someone there?

35:33.465 --> 35:35.067
Hey, honey.

35:45.388 --> 35:47.919
Was there an owl in here last night?

35:48.073 --> 35:51.096
- An owl?
- I thought I saw an owl...

35:51.981 --> 35:53.710
Where?

35:54.555 --> 35:56.095
Coming the window.

35:56.928 --> 35:59.005
They were closed.

35:59.284 --> 36:02.044
It'd still be here,
I guess.

36:05.237 --> 36:06.505
Aren't you cold?

36:07.973 --> 36:09.441
Must have been a dream.

36:11.643 --> 36:12.910
Heck of a dream.

36:14.512 --> 36:17.381
Let me tell you some one more thing
about grizzly bears...

36:17.548 --> 36:21.652
That not only do they get as big
as Volkswagens...

36:22.085 --> 36:23.420
but they also...

36:24.754 --> 36:26.823
...they can run 30 miles an hour.

36:27.022 --> 36:29.092
And they get also chase you up a tree.

36:30.359 --> 36:31.472
The tracks end.

36:33.090 --> 36:35.080
There's a big foot...

36:35.350 --> 36:37.002
- Look at that.
- What?

36:39.765 --> 36:41.148
I don't feel good.

36:41.755 --> 36:42.531
What?

36:42.767 --> 36:44.924
- Come on dad, let's go.
- I just don't... I don't feel good.

36:44.959 --> 36:48.870
- Dad, let's go!
- My head hurts... behind.

36:48.937 --> 36:51.061
Daddy you're OK. Now let's go.

36:51.702 --> 36:52.821
What's the matter?

36:55.588 --> 36:57.466
You've got a little mark there, a little...

36:57.762 --> 36:59.079
Dad, let's go.

36:59.277 --> 37:01.070
Bite or something. Spider bite.

37:01.335 --> 37:02.331
Daddy, come on...

37:02.497 --> 37:03.925
- Does it hurt when I press it?
- Yes!

37:04.091 --> 37:05.518
Oh, I'm sorry.

37:06.348 --> 37:07.510
- You're all right?
- Dad...

37:11.660 --> 37:12.656
Go here...

37:14.083 --> 37:15.178
I'll go home.

37:16.606 --> 37:19.699
Hey, wait for... wait a second.

38:02.998 --> 38:04.698
A cloud passed over the moon.

38:04.798 --> 38:05.798
What cloud?

38:05.898 --> 38:07.698
There's no cloud. It's a clear night.
What are you talking about?

38:07.798 --> 38:10.298
Nobody gets scared when
a cloud passes over the moon.

38:10.947 --> 38:12.542
What's the matter with you?

38:12.708 --> 38:14.305
Are you through?

38:15.334 --> 38:17.927
You're scared?
You really are?

38:17.993 --> 38:19.524
I'm not scared.

38:20.021 --> 38:22.051
What are you?

38:22.184 --> 38:25.507
Well, I'll check out the house,
something's wrong...

38:25.574 --> 38:28.798
Oh, you're gonna check out the house?
Why don't you stay right here.

38:29.662 --> 38:31.956
- Why it got dark like that?
- Put your butt over here in bed.

38:35.047 --> 38:36.077
What's the matter with you?

38:36.809 --> 38:40.133
Nobody is scared of a cloud that
passed over the moon. There was a cloud.

38:40.299 --> 38:43.223
It's a clear night.
What are you talking about, what cloud?

38:43.622 --> 38:45.284
There is no cloud,
what are you talking about!

38:45.450 --> 38:46.347
What cloud!

38:46.381 --> 38:48.143
- Who gets scared if a cloud passes over the moon?
- Why it got dark like that?!

38:48.176 --> 38:49.439
- Nobody...
- I'm so sick of this.

38:49.506 --> 38:52.929
- Shit.
- You're indulging yourself in some weird dream.

38:52.996 --> 38:54.491
- What do you mean?
- You're scared of shadows.

38:54.525 --> 38:57.018
- Don't look a mean like that!
- Cut it out, Whitley!

38:57.981 --> 39:00.474
- I mean it, this isn't funny anymore.
- You are wrong!

39:00.508 --> 39:02.237
- You got a child downstairs!
- You wanna see...

39:02.702 --> 39:05.560
Cut it out, Whit!
You come back to me!

39:07.222 --> 39:09.848
I'm so tired of this!
What is wrong with you?!

39:10.613 --> 39:12.630
Nobody gets scared like that!

39:15.149 --> 39:18.689
I'm a right woman, I'm a good woman,
and you have a beautiful child downstairs,

39:19.333 --> 39:20.430
you have a good life.

39:20.603 --> 39:24.078
What the hell do you think you're doing?
So stupid, fucking bunch of bullshit.

39:24.259 --> 39:26.837
- Go to hell.
- You're so self-indulgent.

42:28.870 --> 42:30.780
What's going on out here?

42:33.122 --> 42:35.293
- What are you shooting at, dad?
- Come on.

42:57.297 --> 43:00.335
I... I think that I'll call Sam Freeman
in the morning.

43:11.922 --> 43:14.593
I didn't know it was you.
That's all.

43:14.794 --> 43:15.962
I didn't know.

43:28.884 --> 43:30.588
What about this, here?

43:36.030 --> 43:37.834
- Is this where you had the injury?
- Yeah.

43:41.474 --> 43:42.576
It's a little red.

43:43.377 --> 43:47.025
Two days ago. Hurt so bad I thought
my head was gonna split.

43:47.584 --> 43:48.570
It's fine now.

43:49.917 --> 43:51.979
You can dress.

43:52.079 --> 43:54.678
It seems to me they
came into the house and they...

43:54.778 --> 43:56.778
they dragged me out
in the middle of the night.

44:02.078 --> 44:03.578
The other thing.

44:03.258 --> 44:05.178
The rectal thing, right.

44:05.578 --> 44:07.078
It happens, you know.

44:07.178 --> 44:08.678
Even to men.

44:10.570 --> 44:14.384
I've been goin' on the notion that
it was some kind of hallucination, you know.

44:14.845 --> 44:16.214
Nightmare.

44:16.355 --> 44:19.671
I speak of it, you know.
I gotta say it feels... real.

44:19.971 --> 44:21.471
I agree.

44:21.571 --> 44:23.071
It seems like something really
happened to you.

44:23.171 --> 44:24.571
They had big eyes.

44:24.671 --> 44:26.071
Fish.

44:26.171 --> 44:27.871
Were they wearing dark glasses?

44:27.971 --> 44:29.771
No, eyes. Big dark eyes.

44:29.871 --> 44:31.371
Like a...

44:31.471 --> 44:33.671
No, more like an insect.

44:34.671 --> 44:36.671
Long face, thin...

44:36.771 --> 44:38.271
Not human.

44:38.371 --> 44:40.371
I don't recall them being human.

44:41.671 --> 44:44.171
So, what's it all about?

44:45.571 --> 44:48.071
Midlife... crisis?

44:48.871 --> 44:51.371
No, I don't think it's a midlife crisis.

44:52.771 --> 44:54.771
Were these grown men?

44:54.871 --> 44:56.371
Were they kids?

44:56.471 --> 44:57.970
Four or five feet, like...

44:58.070 --> 45:00.570
big... thick kids.

45:01.170 --> 45:02.670
They took me.

45:02.770 --> 45:04.270
Out of my own house.

45:04.370 --> 45:05.870
Where did they take you?

45:06.170 --> 45:09.370
I was in this...
you know, smelly small...

45:09.470 --> 45:12.470
round room, and they're all looking at me.

45:12.570 --> 45:13.870
Is that where it happened?

45:13.970 --> 45:16.470
Well, that's a blank, mostly.

45:19.824 --> 45:21.338
There was this needle, you know.

45:21.438 --> 45:23.938
They stuck me
on the back of the head. With the needle.

45:25.170 --> 45:27.461
That's the mark that
I've tried to show you.

45:27.627 --> 45:29.021
And there is a mark there.

45:29.187 --> 45:31.013
You told Anne about all this?

45:31.876 --> 45:33.129
What am I suppose to tell her?

45:33.229 --> 45:35.029
What's to say,
I have to know what happened to me...

45:35.494 --> 45:37.818
before I could say something.
I can't say I'm...

45:37.984 --> 45:40.939
I'm losing my marble suddenly
out of the clear blue sky...

45:41.005 --> 45:42.665
There is no reason for this.

45:42.930 --> 45:45.188
I think the psychiatrist could help you.

45:58.433 --> 46:00.856
- Hi.
- Hello.

46:02.515 --> 46:03.550
Where have you been?

46:04.450 --> 46:06.017
I took a walk.

46:12.321 --> 46:13.788
What did Sam say?

46:13.855 --> 46:16.189
Sam's fine, he sends his love.

46:17.023 --> 46:19.558
- Want some of this?
- No, thank you.

46:19.724 --> 46:23.159
He's... he's sending me to a shrinker.

46:24.327 --> 46:25.160
Good.

46:25.327 --> 46:30.463
It's a woman who specializes in...
would you believe, rape cases.

46:32.464 --> 46:34.865
- You want something to drink?
- No.

46:36.132 --> 46:40.368
- Rape cases?
- Remember that mark I have in there?

46:41.302 --> 46:42.269
Yeah.

46:43.670 --> 46:46.704
Well, I feel certain that
I was given a shot.

46:49.239 --> 46:50.573
You were... a...

46:53.575 --> 46:55.809
When you... a... I...

46:57.344 --> 46:58.578
Wait a minute. Hold it.

47:00.545 --> 47:02.012
Sam gave you a shot.

47:02.211 --> 47:03.045
No.

47:04.912 --> 47:07.781
That night, after Christmas.

47:09.682 --> 47:12.050
The night that I...
OK, here goes.

47:12.583 --> 47:13.951
When I saw them.

47:16.885 --> 47:18.286
When you saw who?

47:24.856 --> 47:26.690
Someone came for me that night.

47:28.025 --> 47:29.292
Who came for you?

47:30.425 --> 47:32.026
Somebody came into the house.

47:34.061 --> 47:35.495
Wait a minute, what did you say?

47:36.128 --> 47:38.530
Somebody came into the house
and took me, and...

47:39.964 --> 47:41.231
and...

47:42.899 --> 47:45.533
they gave me a shot
in the back of my skull...

47:46.901 --> 47:48.202
and...

47:49.069 --> 47:51.770
This is ridiculous... they were...

47:52.070 --> 47:54.705
small, bluish skin and...

47:55.205 --> 47:56.673
...there were others.

47:57.840 --> 48:00.374
Long thin faces and big eyes...

48:01.675 --> 48:02.809
and...

48:05.543 --> 48:07.377
this is the tough part...

48:07.944 --> 48:10.579
they did not appear to be...

48:11.379 --> 48:12.525
human.

48:16.101 --> 48:17.977
I'm sorry. What?

48:20.790 --> 48:22.560
Sam... you know, he...

48:23.671 --> 48:26.033
I don't know what he thinks...

48:26.296 --> 48:28.986
but I think I'm hallucinating.

48:32.202 --> 48:36.565
Major, maybe psychotic... hallucinations.

48:38.960 --> 48:41.552
So, that's it...

48:42.897 --> 48:44.012
what I...

48:44.669 --> 48:46.440
have been trying to say...

48:47.523 --> 48:49.608
in a nutshell.

49:17.407 --> 49:20.407
You know what?
You do this regularly to me. You...

49:20.507 --> 49:25.007
If it isn't the crystal in the sky,
then you're flying around the room.

49:26.407 --> 49:27.907
But, this is...

49:28.907 --> 49:32.407
This is such bad material.
That uh...

49:35.207 --> 49:36.707
Little people...

49:37.707 --> 49:39.707
with big eyes.

49:40.407 --> 49:42.707
Some of them are blue.

49:47.407 --> 49:49.907
It's magazine writing.

49:53.407 --> 49:55.407
So who's been uh...

49:55.507 --> 49:57.007
working on your stuff?

50:01.407 --> 50:03.407
You're taking drugs?

50:03.507 --> 50:04.307
Come on.

50:04.307 --> 50:06.307
So, what is it?
A girl?

50:06.907 --> 50:07.907
Hm?

50:08.407 --> 50:11.406
You've come to a certain age,
and blah blah blah?

50:13.406 --> 50:15.406
Cause you know what I think?

50:16.406 --> 50:18.406
I think you're lying to my face.

50:25.217 --> 50:28.688
You guys went out and left me
a little while ago...

50:29.051 --> 50:30.902
We just went out for a second.

50:31.431 --> 50:32.984
We just had to get some air.

50:33.745 --> 50:37.248
You were having an argument
and you forgot me.

50:38.471 --> 50:41.414
I would never forget you.

50:41.843 --> 50:44.156
That sure is good news.

50:45.611 --> 50:49.974
And now, you jelly bean,
go to sleep.

50:52.982 --> 50:55.197
Mommy, is God real?

50:56.783 --> 50:58.535
I think so.

50:59.923 --> 51:01.227
I hope so.

51:04.870 --> 51:06.975
But nobody knows for sure?

51:08.880 --> 51:09.917
No.

51:10.653 --> 51:12.691
Actually they don't. Nobody knows.

51:14.127 --> 51:20.411
So we're all alone,
except for the little blue doctors?

51:22.150 --> 51:24.122
Who are the little blue doctors?

51:24.589 --> 51:28.767
They come to the cabin.
They have big black eyes.

51:29.269 --> 51:31.074
They're really scary.

51:31.241 --> 51:36.355
They said "We won't hurt you",
but I'd pray for them to go away.

51:36.923 --> 51:42.104
But they just kept shining their lights on me.
God didn't make them go away.

51:43.976 --> 51:46.549
Can I dream dad's dreams?

51:49.725 --> 51:51.798
- I'm Janet Duffy.
- Hi, Anne Strieber.

51:51.865 --> 51:52.533
Hello.

51:54.339 --> 51:55.107
Whitley.

51:55.575 --> 51:56.344
Yes.

51:56.611 --> 51:57.681
Sit down.

51:58.484 --> 52:00.689
Sam and I've already talked.

52:01.458 --> 52:03.464
You're comfortable being here together?

52:03.964 --> 52:04.867
Sure.

52:07.173 --> 52:07.876
Yes.

52:08.042 --> 52:10.315
Good.
A healthy sign.

52:11.786 --> 52:12.689
So...

52:13.223 --> 52:17.701
So, Sam told you that I'm seeing
a small people coming into my house...

52:17.868 --> 52:20.409
and taking me away, and this kind of thing...
and...

52:20.876 --> 52:24.386
- Do you drink?
- Yeah, sure. But that's not it.

52:24.654 --> 52:25.523
Drugs?

52:25.823 --> 52:28.865
When I was a kid, you know,
the usual thing, but that's...

52:29.065 --> 52:30.837
I'm way too old for that.

52:31.405 --> 52:34.113
Hallucinations? Flights of imagination?

52:35.817 --> 52:39.928
Just the occasional delusion of grandeur.

52:44.107 --> 52:45.711
Tell me what happened to you?

52:47.115 --> 52:50.390
What can I say? These little blue midgets
come into my house.

52:51.493 --> 52:53.827
They... it's ridiculous...

52:54.328 --> 52:58.196
They took me out of the house,
and they stuck a needle in my head, and...

52:59.096 --> 53:02.298
I had some kind of rectal probe.

53:02.798 --> 53:04.233
This happened when?

53:05.299 --> 53:06.934
Day after Christmas.

53:08.034 --> 53:10.735
Right? It was on 26th.

53:11.402 --> 53:14.004
Any disturbances at all prior to this?

53:14.170 --> 53:15.337
No!

53:16.170 --> 53:17.971
He does worry about prowlers.

53:18.137 --> 53:19.671
Place is isolated.

53:20.506 --> 53:23.207
But there haven't been any actual prowlers?

53:23.406 --> 53:27.175
No. Sounds and thing like that,
you know, nothing that you could...

53:28.543 --> 53:31.410
No. Nothing that you could identify.

53:31.644 --> 53:34.679
There was one weekend in October.

53:35.579 --> 53:38.686
We had friends up, Alex and Sara.

53:40.306 --> 53:43.711
They saw something that scared them
so much, that they left.

53:44.835 --> 53:46.983
They saw lights. You saw them too.

53:47.149 --> 53:49.463
There was light all over the place.

53:49.727 --> 53:54.652
They got so scared,
that they left the next day. And...

53:56.767 --> 54:01.198
But I... I have all this
very sensitive equipment.

54:02.056 --> 54:03.643
Lights and...

54:05.230 --> 54:07.135
burglar on top of things...

54:08.071 --> 54:11.346
So you discussed it, you investigated?

54:11.813 --> 54:15.757
We didn't... investigate?
There was nothing to investigate.

54:16.626 --> 54:18.964
So what scared them? What happened?

54:19.131 --> 54:22.139
I'm talking about it and I have no idea.

54:23.308 --> 54:29.557
I have no idea. I have no idea why I'm here,
I don't know what I'm doing.

54:29.725 --> 54:31.396
You know, talking about this.

54:34.670 --> 54:37.177
I saw something... they saw something...

54:42.791 --> 54:44.897
There was a lot of light.

54:46.099 --> 54:47.671
That's all I remember.

54:48.138 --> 54:51.696
It seems to me, that the overall vagueness
of your memory suggests

54:51.905 --> 54:53.865
that we might clarify them
a little bit by hypnosis.

54:54.048 --> 54:56.419
Would you be agreeable to that?

54:56.492 --> 54:58.081
Hypnosis?

54:58.209 --> 55:00.647
It's a simple process.

55:00.814 --> 55:04.379
It's sometimes very helpful in cases
of psychological trauma,

55:04.463 --> 55:07.470
when people have difficulty remembering
what happened to them.

55:07.970 --> 55:09.970
Well, you think about that, and...

55:10.070 --> 55:12.870
If you decide to do it
you can give me a call.

55:12.970 --> 55:13.970
Thank you.

55:14.811 --> 55:17.224
I'd stick pins in my eyeballs before I'd let
that...

55:17.324 --> 55:20.124
that wacko woman fool with me.

55:20.407 --> 55:21.925
This woman is a pro.

55:22.912 --> 55:25.457
Sam sent you to her,
her evidence is accepted in court.

55:26.539 --> 55:28.075
Did you listen to her?

55:30.395 --> 55:31.691
What do you mean I did listen to her?

55:31.864 --> 55:33.849
Why should I pay someone to talk to me?

55:34.059 --> 55:35.760
Because you fired God damned gun
at me last week!

55:35.944 --> 55:37.571
I'm all right with seeing her!

55:37.080 --> 55:38.761
She should pay me!

55:38.943 --> 55:42.707
Selfish prick.
Sit up and talk to me!

55:43.166 --> 55:44.775
I'd rather be dead.

55:45.433 --> 55:46.894
I'm gonna tell you something:

55:48.611 --> 55:52.302
You gonna go back in that woman's office,
we gonna find out what's wrong with you...

55:52.375 --> 55:54.348
or we're not gonna have any marriage left.

55:57.783 --> 55:59.384
I'm sitting up! I'm sitting.

55:59.551 --> 56:00.518
My shoes hurt.

56:01.685 --> 56:03.821
I'm sitting. So, you know, lighten up.

56:07.489 --> 56:08.890
Crazy women...

56:09.891 --> 56:11.559
So, what do I do?

56:11.625 --> 56:13.560
What should I do?
Where would you like me to go?

56:13.726 --> 56:15.995
It's best he'd be alone
his first time.

56:16.661 --> 56:17.362
Alright.

56:25.500 --> 56:26.600
So?

56:27.201 --> 56:29.069
It's not exactly the electric chair.

56:31.937 --> 56:34.472
Listen to me Whitley.
Look up at my finger.

56:35.473 --> 56:38.242
That's it. Keep looking at my finger.

56:40.243 --> 56:43.578
I'm going to count to ten,
as you're falling asleep.

56:44.312 --> 56:47.981
And when I'm finished, you'll be
deeply, deeply asleep.

56:49.082 --> 56:51.183
One... falling asleep,

56:52.417 --> 56:55.419
two... falling asleep,

56:56.587 --> 56:59.721
thee... falling asleep,

57:00.756 --> 57:03.758
four... falling asleep,

57:06.859 --> 57:09.962
five... falling asleep,

57:11.829 --> 57:12.897
Whitley?

57:15.666 --> 57:22.170
Whitley, let's go back to that first time,
the night of October 4th.

57:22.403 --> 57:24.404
Last October 4th

57:24.570 --> 57:25.871
What do you see?

57:26.904 --> 57:28.473
October 4th...

57:30.941 --> 57:37.588
Busy day. Writing, cooking,
mess in the kitchen and...

57:37.823 --> 57:40.261
Alex and Sara came. Going to the country.

57:41.331 --> 57:42.433
Yes?

57:42.600 --> 57:46.441
So we're in a car, we're talking, and there's
a lot of traffic, and it's getting dark...

57:46.642 --> 57:50.718
We get up there and I can't get
the security system to work. It's...

57:50.885 --> 57:53.124
just every time I touch it, it goes crazy.

57:53.725 --> 57:56.264
Anne fixes it, we go in the house...

57:56.632 --> 58:00.540
build a fire.
First fire in the season.

58:01.776 --> 58:02.978
And we went to bed.

58:03.146 --> 58:05.050
What happens after you go to bed?

58:05.818 --> 58:08.157
I wake up, middle of the night.

58:12.734 --> 58:15.841
That's...
I don't... I don't...

58:24.460 --> 58:26.598
Something went past my window.

58:31.941 --> 58:34.613
- Something went past the window?
- A light.

58:37.820 --> 58:39.924
Big, like a light.

58:41.795 --> 58:42.797
But...

58:43.332 --> 58:45.770
I don't want to think about that, so...

58:47.273 --> 58:48.809
I go back to sleep.

59:05.779 --> 59:07.382
Is that someone there?

59:07.850 --> 59:08.685
You know...

59:09.286 --> 59:10.589
I see you.

59:11.691 --> 59:13.195
I'm seeing some...

59:13.361 --> 59:14.831
I'm seeing someone there...

59:14.998 --> 59:16.534
I don't think I like this.

59:17.671 --> 59:18.873
- It's going fine.
- Get out!

59:19.106 --> 59:20.276
It's going fine...

59:21.311 --> 59:22.280
Away!

59:23.316 --> 59:26.222
Get away!
Out! Get out!

59:26.856 --> 59:27.891
Get away!

59:30.096 --> 59:32.300
Why me? What have I done?

59:36.610 --> 59:38.713
This is no god. I can't do this.

59:39.716 --> 59:41.720
Whitley, tell me what you see.

59:42.020 --> 59:44.993
It's almost as if this figure is...

59:47.699 --> 59:51.741
It's covered in something,
it's sticking something into my mind.

59:54.314 --> 59:56.625
Images exploding...

59:59.595 --> 01:00:01.110
The world is blowing up...

01:00:06.632 --> 01:00:08.256
My boy is dead.

01:00:10.927 --> 01:00:14.139
Why I have to die, dad?
Why?

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.915
I'm not hypnotized now?
Am I?

01:00:23.275 --> 01:00:25.513
I think you just came out of it.

01:00:29.513 --> 01:00:31.013
I can't do this.

01:00:31.613 --> 01:00:33.112
What did I see?

01:00:33.212 --> 01:00:34.798
I don't know.

01:00:34.898 --> 01:00:37.415
I want to go home now.
I can't do this.

01:00:38.506 --> 01:00:41.547
I don't need this. Bad dreams.

01:00:46.163 --> 01:00:47.138
Whitley?

01:00:48.906 --> 01:00:50.674
It was a bad state.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.227
But it's over.

01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:55.367
It'll never be over, not now.

01:00:55.547 --> 01:00:58.435
Whatever happened is in the past,
and you're fine.

01:00:58.795 --> 01:01:00.528
You don't know, you said it.

01:01:01.286 --> 01:01:03.289
That's true, but it's all right.

01:01:03.956 --> 01:01:04.758
Whitley...

01:01:08.130 --> 01:01:10.501
Let him go, let him work this out.

01:01:41.581 --> 01:01:43.180
Excuse me, I'm lost.

01:01:43.613 --> 01:01:46.944
Can you help me? Do you know if this
bus goes to the end of the line?

01:01:53.208 --> 01:01:54.540
You know...

01:01:57.539 --> 01:01:58.871
I can't believe this.

01:02:01.503 --> 01:02:02.935
It's an ambush.

01:02:04.901 --> 01:02:06.900
You, people... you're in...

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.797
I'm telling, you're in for one big surprise.
One very big surprise.

01:02:21.625 --> 01:02:24.124
- You want anything else, Whit?
- No, thank you.

01:02:28.821 --> 01:02:31.438
- They're all looking for you.
- How did you know?

01:02:31.606 --> 01:02:33.182
Anne said to look here.

01:02:33.485 --> 01:02:34.927
Women know everything.

01:02:35.095 --> 01:02:36.403
Let's go home.

01:02:38.113 --> 01:02:39.523
They tell you what happened?

01:02:40.663 --> 01:02:41.703
A little.

01:02:42.207 --> 01:02:46.031
When the doctor hypnotized me, I was
supposed recall prowlers, or something...

01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:49.758
but in fact I recall something else...
I sure do.

01:02:49.959 --> 01:02:51.098
What?

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:54.077
Little blue fuckers,
about that big.

01:02:54.177 --> 01:02:57.577
When I was a boy we knew of these things.

01:02:59.177 --> 01:03:01.677
In the mountains
there were many mines.

01:03:03.577 --> 01:03:05.077
Strange men were seen.

01:03:05.377 --> 01:03:07.377
Little and tough.

01:03:08.077 --> 01:03:10.477
They were called gobbles.

01:03:10.577 --> 01:03:12.577
The people of the lower depth.

01:03:13.877 --> 01:03:14.877
Gobbles?

01:03:16.577 --> 01:03:18.577
You're talking about munchkins?

01:03:19.977 --> 01:03:21.977
You're talking about trolls?

01:03:22.077 --> 01:03:23.577
You're talking about... leprechauns?

01:03:23.677 --> 01:03:24.777
What are you talking about?

01:03:24.877 --> 01:03:26.577
Whitley, the little men are evil.

01:03:26.677 --> 01:03:28.177
They have haunted the world forever.

01:03:28.677 --> 01:03:31.177
You're talking about folk... stuff.

01:03:32.577 --> 01:03:33.577
I don't know...

01:03:33.677 --> 01:03:35.677
Trolls, or something.

01:03:35.777 --> 01:03:37.277
I'm talking about something else.

01:03:39.894 --> 01:03:41.961
We're back! I found him!

01:03:43.195 --> 01:03:45.062
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

01:03:48.597 --> 01:03:50.999
I'm sorry that I got so crazy.

01:03:51.165 --> 01:03:52.932
Oh, don't worry about it.

01:03:53.099 --> 01:03:54.500
- I've been thinking...
- Any calls?

01:03:54.667 --> 01:03:55.567
No.

01:03:57.167 --> 01:03:58.568
Whitley...

01:04:00.235 --> 01:04:02.736
There is a group, that meets that...

01:04:02.904 --> 01:04:04.604
you might want to join?

01:04:04.937 --> 01:04:05.971
Group?

01:04:06.205 --> 01:04:08.472
People who've seen the same
sort of things you have.

01:04:09.739 --> 01:04:11.307
No, I don't think so.

01:04:11.806 --> 01:04:13.541
Whitley, they are real.

01:04:13.841 --> 01:04:18.243
I have a dozen patients who've all
reported seeing the same beings you saw.

01:04:20.377 --> 01:04:21.210
No!

01:04:22.678 --> 01:04:23.678
All right.

01:04:24.578 --> 01:04:28.481
There is one illness,
temporal lobe epilepsy.

01:04:29.414 --> 01:04:31.581
It might cause such vivid hallucinations.

01:04:31.748 --> 01:04:35.249
Yes, but we all saw the light.
Do we all have epilepsy?

01:04:35.417 --> 01:04:38.118
Even I heard some strange noises.

01:04:39.351 --> 01:04:43.419
There is a test that you can take
to determine whether you have the disease.

01:04:43.952 --> 01:04:47.087
Oh, this is going to be just
a little bit unpleasant.

01:04:47.621 --> 01:04:49.455
There's sticking... it sticking...

01:04:49.621 --> 01:04:52.189
Don't move.
Stay very still now.

01:04:52.523 --> 01:04:53.423
Don't talk.

01:04:55.056 --> 01:04:56.624
How long does this take?

01:04:56.791 --> 01:04:58.692
Not long, not long.

01:04:58.892 --> 01:05:00.826
About 45 minutes.

01:05:01.026 --> 01:05:04.494
I would like you to do
some deep breathing exercises for me.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.095
OK, breath in deeply through your mouth.

01:05:12.964 --> 01:05:14.298
Close your eyes.

01:05:16.933 --> 01:05:18.467
Open your eyes.

01:05:21.367 --> 01:05:25.436
Now, that medication I gave you earlier
is gonna make you take a little nap.

01:05:47.744 --> 01:05:49.078
What is it, Whit?

01:05:58.882 --> 01:05:59.749
Good news!

01:06:00.216 --> 01:06:01.883
The test came back negative.

01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:05.484
You do not have temporal lobe epilepsy.

01:06:12.388 --> 01:06:13.421
Hi, dad.

01:06:13.888 --> 01:06:16.556
Dad, I waited and waited for you
to come home.

01:06:18.723 --> 01:06:20.759
Help me get to sleep, daddy?

01:06:22.527 --> 01:06:25.297
I'm having a very hard time
without you.

01:06:27.132 --> 01:06:30.403
<i>Without a sound the white camellia fell,</i>

01:06:31.671 --> 01:06:35.342
<i>To sound the darkness of the deep stone well.</i>

01:06:35.576 --> 01:06:38.612
That's a lot of pictures for a few words.

01:06:39.013 --> 01:06:40.080
Yeah.

01:06:40.615 --> 01:06:43.251
It's a kind of a poem called "Haiku".

01:06:43.685 --> 01:06:46.354
Dad, I have a very bad problem.

01:06:47.255 --> 01:06:50.492
- What's that?
- There's a skull staring at me.

01:06:50.658 --> 01:06:54.029
With huge eyes.
I can see it in my head.

01:06:56.098 --> 01:06:57.500
Do you have a bad dream?

01:06:57.766 --> 01:06:58.767
No.

01:07:03.506 --> 01:07:05.775
I saw little blue doctors, dad.

01:07:05.942 --> 01:07:08.211
And tall thin ones too.

01:07:08.545 --> 01:07:09.980
With big eyes.

01:07:10.147 --> 01:07:12.616
Were they real, dad?

01:07:13.284 --> 01:07:15.019
I don't know.

01:07:16.487 --> 01:07:18.689
What do you think they are?

01:07:18.857 --> 01:07:21.994
I don't know. They kind of scare me.

01:07:22.627 --> 01:07:23.795
Kind of?

01:07:24.196 --> 01:07:26.599
Not totally, they're ugly and...

01:07:27.299 --> 01:07:29.168
that's scary, but...

01:07:30.369 --> 01:07:31.504
inside...

01:07:33.506 --> 01:07:36.176
they are sort of soft and perfect.

01:07:36.544 --> 01:07:37.911
Like that poem.

01:08:40.747 --> 01:08:44.118
Ten... falling asleep.

01:08:44.952 --> 01:08:47.455
Deeply, deeply asleep.

01:08:51.426 --> 01:08:54.629
Anne, let's go back in time.

01:08:55.429 --> 01:08:57.265
Do you remember Christmas?

01:08:58.966 --> 01:09:01.069
All right, let's go back further.

01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:05.742
Go back to the night,
that Alex and Sara came to the house.

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:08.144
Do you remember that night?

01:09:09.412 --> 01:09:11.448
Well, it wasn't a very peaceful night.

01:09:12.049 --> 01:09:13.015
Go on.

01:09:16.086 --> 01:09:17.622
The house was full.

01:09:19.924 --> 01:09:21.459
It was like a party.

01:09:21.859 --> 01:09:23.060
A party?

01:09:23.662 --> 01:09:26.531
I don't think Whitley was there
right much of the time.

01:09:27.631 --> 01:09:29.131
What about your son.

01:09:29.299 --> 01:09:30.233
God!

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:32.368
Oh God, he's screaming.

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:41.008
It's painful to hear.

01:09:41.642 --> 01:09:44.042
Oh, it's like something's
happening to him. It's...

01:09:44.211 --> 01:09:46.279
Whitley is going, I wanna go.

01:09:46.712 --> 01:09:47.912
I've got to go.

01:09:48.981 --> 01:09:50.881
You are not suppose to go.

01:09:52.183 --> 01:09:53.884
I've got to go!

01:09:55.852 --> 01:09:58.120
You are suppose to stay in bed.

01:10:00.388 --> 01:10:04.025
I've got to go, my baby is screaming!

01:10:04.124 --> 01:10:05.392
Anne, who is talking to you?

01:10:05.458 --> 01:10:10.562
I can't say! I'm not suppose to say, I don't know!
I'm not supposed to do this!

01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:13.165
Why? What's preventing you?

01:10:14.732 --> 01:10:16.834
I'm out of it... I'm out of it, right?
I'm out of it.

01:10:17.067 --> 01:10:18.569
Yes, quite suddenly.

01:10:18.669 --> 01:10:21.405
I don't know...
there was somebody, there was something...

01:10:22.905 --> 01:10:24.807
There was somebody else...

01:10:32.746 --> 01:10:36.049
He calls them "little doctors".

01:10:39.651 --> 01:10:41.086
I don't like this.

01:10:42.153 --> 01:10:44.155
He seems so little.

01:10:46.022 --> 01:10:47.224
What should we do?

01:10:48.925 --> 01:10:51.627
Should he be hypnotized,
we send him to Janet?

01:10:53.228 --> 01:10:54.929
No, he is too young.

01:10:57.697 --> 01:11:00.399
I'll go back myself,
see what this is.

01:11:07.004 --> 01:11:13.609
Whitley, let's go back now to the night
of December 26th, the day after Christmas.

01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:15.777
What are you having for supper?

01:11:20.048 --> 01:11:24.718
Goose... and a cranberry sauce, sweet potatoes,
Christmas leftovers.

01:11:27.353 --> 01:11:30.055
Now, go forward to later that night.

01:11:30.489 --> 01:11:32.023
Go forward.

01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:33.958
What happens?

01:11:35.426 --> 01:11:37.160
I'm checking out the house.

01:11:37.527 --> 01:11:38.428
Why?

01:11:40.596 --> 01:11:43.232
In case there might be somebody there...

01:11:43.599 --> 01:11:44.766
...hiding.

01:11:45.233 --> 01:11:46.134
Who?

01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:48.202
Those things people.

01:11:48.536 --> 01:11:51.638
- Did you know about those people then?
- Sure.

01:11:52.605 --> 01:11:54.073
Did you tell anyone?

01:11:55.141 --> 01:11:56.809
Well, I wasn't supposed to.

01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:01.311
I have a gun.

01:12:03.412 --> 01:12:04.981
Why do you have a gun?

01:12:05.781 --> 01:12:06.848
I have that...

01:12:07.249 --> 01:12:09.717
the feeling... that

01:12:11.385 --> 01:12:12.319
there might...

01:12:16.022 --> 01:12:18.457
...be somebody there, hiding.

01:12:20.192 --> 01:12:20.993
In the house.

01:12:21.159 --> 01:12:24.928
I'm going to take you further forward
in that night.

01:12:25.596 --> 01:12:28.565
You relax, deep sleep.

01:12:28.732 --> 01:12:31.200
You're going to remain calm.

01:12:31.968 --> 01:12:32.768
What happens?

01:12:32.935 --> 01:12:36.438
I am you. You are me,
and...

01:12:38.005 --> 01:12:39.539
we are here.

01:12:43.943 --> 01:12:47.179
I am the dreamer, you are the dream.

01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:03.290
Is that someone there?

01:13:45.055 --> 01:13:45.556
Wow!

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:50.526
Wait a minute.

01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:54.595
What are you doing?

01:13:56.363 --> 01:13:57.898
Please, let me go.

01:14:01.134 --> 01:14:03.035
Awful, terrible.

01:14:03.536 --> 01:14:06.103
- What's terrible?
- What they did to me.

01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:05.415
I had enough, I give up.
I wanna go home.

01:15:15.121 --> 01:15:16.255
Be smart.

01:15:26.163 --> 01:15:27.564
Are you old?

01:15:31.099 --> 01:15:33.768
Please, let me go.

01:15:36.570 --> 01:15:37.738
I can't wake up.

01:15:39.339 --> 01:15:41.142
Here I am! I'm naked.

01:15:41.609 --> 01:15:45.280
I'm naked!
I'm talking to you like you were real.

01:15:46.549 --> 01:15:47.750
Go to hell.

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:54.491
Terrible.

01:16:03.003 --> 01:16:04.605
Can we talk this over?

01:16:06.273 --> 01:16:08.509
It looks like we're
gonna sing White Christmas.

01:16:14.917 --> 01:16:16.352
You're probing my mind.

01:16:33.507 --> 01:16:34.509
I'll kill you.

01:16:39.614 --> 01:16:41.184
How dare you.

01:16:53.232 --> 01:16:54.401
I'll kill you.

01:17:19.932 --> 01:17:21.433
You've broken my mind.

01:17:50.770 --> 01:17:52.206
I can't get out of this.

01:18:01.584 --> 01:18:02.452
Mom.

01:18:07.158 --> 01:18:08.393
Come on in here!

01:18:12.398 --> 01:18:15.168
Oh, he wants a...
he wants his mommy.

01:18:46.508 --> 01:18:47.542
Mommy!

01:18:55.286 --> 01:18:56.954
I can't get out of this!

01:18:57.621 --> 01:18:59.015
One... waking up.

01:18:59.878 --> 01:19:01.703
Two... waking up.

01:19:02.732 --> 01:19:04.523
I'm seeing things from my whole life.

01:19:05.519 --> 01:19:06.714
What is it, Whit?

01:19:09.733 --> 01:19:11.625
Wow...

01:19:12.919 --> 01:19:14.545
Three... you're awake.

01:19:37.374 --> 01:19:38.138
It's been...

01:19:40.593 --> 01:19:41.496
Thank you.

01:19:42.767 --> 01:19:47.649
Now I know, this thing has been
in my life... my whole life.

01:19:48.819 --> 01:19:49.989
I passed it on.

01:19:52.630 --> 01:19:54.201
Now it's with my son.

01:19:59.317 --> 01:20:00.922
I've seen them before.

01:20:02.828 --> 01:20:04.366
In your childhood apparently.

01:20:04.433 --> 01:20:07.843
No, no, no. Like I'm seeing you,
like I'm seeing this.

01:20:07.877 --> 01:20:11.020
Like I'm seeing everything...
seeing room.

01:20:17.974 --> 01:20:19.043
You say, that...

01:20:20.648 --> 01:20:21.885
there is a group.

01:20:22.487 --> 01:20:24.293
Yes, a special group.

01:20:32.986 --> 01:20:34.457
I don't want to be crazy.

01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:41.110
I'd like to introduce Anne and Whitley.

01:20:41.278 --> 01:20:44.236
Whitley's had some very vivid experiences.

01:20:44.464 --> 01:20:45.504
He's a writer...

01:20:45.601 --> 01:20:48.950
I'm not sure, I'm comfortable
with the writer being here, Janet.

01:20:49.113 --> 01:20:51.583
Yeah, the force will kick me off
if this got out.

01:20:51.681 --> 01:20:54.672
Do the rest of you feel threatened
by his profession?

01:20:54.834 --> 01:20:59.158
Let's face it, the newspapers laugh of us.
We're more like entertainment.

01:21:01.759 --> 01:21:05.042
Not that kind of writer.
I'm make it up. I'm a novelist.

01:21:05.205 --> 01:21:06.863
So, what you're gonna write about us?

01:21:06.993 --> 01:21:08.033
A comic novel?

01:21:08.196 --> 01:21:09.496
Wait a minute,

01:21:09.659 --> 01:21:12.357
Whitley isn't here because he is a writer.

01:21:12.519 --> 01:21:14.633
He's here for the same reasons you are.

01:21:14.795 --> 01:21:17.851
Why don't you tell us something
of what you can remember?

01:21:18.013 --> 01:21:19.672
What I remember?

01:21:22.792 --> 01:21:26.562
It couldn't be what happened, that
what happened, I don't know, I remember...

01:21:28.221 --> 01:21:29.489
monsters.

01:21:32.674 --> 01:21:33.877
They came into my house.

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:40.054
The short stocky ones in the coveralls
or the slim willowy ones with the big eyes.

01:21:40.217 --> 01:21:41.224
Beg your pardon?

01:21:42.005 --> 01:21:42.818
What?

01:21:43.435 --> 01:21:44.996
Who was involved with you?

01:21:46.329 --> 01:21:47.044
What do you mean?

01:21:47.076 --> 01:21:48.539
Oh come on, let's cut the crap.

01:21:48.832 --> 01:21:50.555
Which group of the aliens abducted you?

01:21:50.718 --> 01:21:54.359
Bob, we are not victims,
we are participants.

01:21:54.618 --> 01:21:58.650
Well, I don't know' about you folks,
but I am very definitely a victim.

01:21:58.812 --> 01:22:01.576
I didn't want what happened to me.
I didn't ask for this.

01:22:01.738 --> 01:22:04.599
Wait a minute. Give the guy chance.
So come on, Whitley,

01:22:04.697 --> 01:22:06.809
which group abducted you?

01:22:07.005 --> 01:22:09.379
- Did you see a ship?
- Ship?

01:22:09.671 --> 01:22:10.418
A Ship.

01:22:12.076 --> 01:22:14.417
This happened in the house,
in the country.

01:22:15.132 --> 01:22:19.717
Oh, do you have circle or a triangle scar
anywhere in your body?

01:22:20.756 --> 01:22:21.471
No.

01:22:21.829 --> 01:22:25.957
Because a lot of us have marks. You know,
I want to get back to this participant thing...

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:32.087
I didn't want what they did to me.
I didn't want a rectal probe, Laurie.

01:22:33.730 --> 01:22:37.232
It's not funny.
That's why I say victim.

01:22:37.448 --> 01:22:39.458
Nobody wants it, nobody asked for it.

01:22:39.626 --> 01:22:42.942
We have to make this experience work for us.

01:22:43.109 --> 01:22:46.190
Otherwise we'll live the rest
of our lives in fear.

01:22:46.459 --> 01:22:47.698
So we get together.

01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:50.579
- And we talk about it.
- And laugh.

01:22:51.282 --> 01:22:52.254
Sometimes.

01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:57.143
Well, we're all space cadets here.
So what the heck.

01:22:57.546 --> 01:22:59.555
You have to make the best of it.
You know.

01:22:59.723 --> 01:23:03.341
This isn't a joke.
These beings are real.

01:23:03.508 --> 01:23:06.388
Even if we don't know what that means.

01:23:07.695 --> 01:23:10.040
It may sound like a cliché, but...

01:23:10.475 --> 01:23:13.121
these visitors do come in gigantic ships

01:23:13.591 --> 01:23:15.533
and they contact a lot of people.

01:23:16.974 --> 01:23:23.840
Then of course, we say it's... ee... thunderstorms
or bad dreams, hallucinations, meteors, whatever, but...

01:23:25.179 --> 01:23:26.485
the joke's on us.

01:23:27.323 --> 01:23:28.897
We are the ones who are hiding.

01:23:29.868 --> 01:23:33.352
They came to me one night in 1959.

01:23:33.654 --> 01:23:35.663
I was lying in bed, reading a book,

01:23:35.831 --> 01:23:40.922
when suddenly a group of little men
in blue uniforms walked in the room.

01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:44.272
Short, three or four feet tall.

01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:47.287
Very round, their faces were...

01:23:48.124 --> 01:23:50.703
Well, I was terrified.

01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:55.360
One of them put his hand on my wrist...

01:23:55.527 --> 01:23:57.570
- And it was...
- Clammy.

01:23:57.872 --> 01:23:59.714
Like the skin of a frog.

01:24:00.283 --> 01:24:04.872
And one of them said: don't worry,
it's not you we're interested in.

01:24:07.552 --> 01:24:09.260
We are interested in...

01:24:09.964 --> 01:24:11.772
the girl child you're carrying.

01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:13.681
Did they let you keep her?

01:24:15.022 --> 01:24:16.987
My daughter is a wonderful woman.

01:24:18.254 --> 01:24:20.919
And now her daughter is involved to.

01:24:22.353 --> 01:24:23.552
How old is she?

01:24:24.851 --> 01:24:26.617
My granddaughter is six.

01:24:26.785 --> 01:24:28.082
Passed it on.

01:24:29.216 --> 01:24:33.348
The only thing to do
is to face it.

01:24:33.681 --> 01:24:37.579
Because otherwise it's just gonna
tear your life to pieces.

01:24:37.646 --> 01:24:40.045
Believe me, I know.

01:24:40.213 --> 01:24:42.744
At least you two have each other.

01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:48.942
My husband did not have the experience,
and he tried to have me committed.

01:24:50.342 --> 01:24:53.241
Now at least he doesn't have me
to worry about anymore.

01:24:53.841 --> 01:24:55.973
I wasn't as lucky as Laurie.

01:24:56.706 --> 01:24:59.105
She still has her daughter and the granddaughter.

01:25:00.505 --> 01:25:02.338
I was 3 months pregnant.

01:25:03.238 --> 01:25:07.703
And my husband and I saw this huge light outside.

01:25:09.036 --> 01:25:10.502
We just went to sleep.

01:25:12.368 --> 01:25:15.367
That next morning I woke up
and I wasn't pregnant anymore.

01:25:15.667 --> 01:25:16.800
Whitley...

01:25:17.866 --> 01:25:20.365
Won't you tell us little more
about what happened to you.

01:25:21.632 --> 01:25:23.431
I think I'd like to go home.

01:25:23.997 --> 01:25:26.563
So, it's my wife and I, you know,
we have a family too,

01:25:26.663 --> 01:25:28.462
and we have to think about this.

01:25:34.327 --> 01:25:35.392
Thank you.

01:25:37.759 --> 01:25:39.191
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:25:41.157 --> 01:25:43.257
- Very much.
- Come back.

01:25:48.688 --> 01:25:50.154
I wish you'd stay.

01:25:51.554 --> 01:25:55.519
I tried hypnosis, I tried this, I tried that,
I tried this, I tried that...

01:25:55.985 --> 01:25:59.385
No, it's not working.
I have to do something for myself.

01:25:59.717 --> 01:26:03.150
You expect things,
you expect answers so quickly.

01:26:03.317 --> 01:26:05.749
We don't even know all the questions yet.

01:26:08.582 --> 01:26:11.314
All right, of course. But...

01:26:11.581 --> 01:26:16.412
if... if... if I was in my right mind,
I would know that too.

01:26:18.545 --> 01:26:22.444
There is nothing matter with your mind,
be patient.

01:26:22.710 --> 01:26:24.343
Take care.

01:26:55.131 --> 01:26:56.297
Look at me.

01:27:00.163 --> 01:27:01.562
Am I not gorgeous?

01:27:01.730 --> 01:27:03.362
What the hell...

01:27:12.359 --> 01:27:15.058
You look like you're dressed for your
First Communion.

01:27:16.524 --> 01:27:18.193
Don't wait up for me, baby.

01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:22.165
What are you doing?

01:27:24.669 --> 01:27:25.937
I shall return.

01:27:27.205 --> 01:27:28.407
Where you're going?

01:27:36.517 --> 01:27:38.153
Going for pack of cigarettes.

01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:52.239
You don't smoke.

01:31:54.196 --> 01:31:55.918
I must be awake.

01:31:57.799 --> 01:31:59.240
Is that what you mean?

01:32:01.883 --> 01:32:03.484
I must be awake.

01:33:17.548 --> 01:33:20.151
I'm gonna do a trick.
Look at this.

01:33:20.311 --> 01:33:22.851
Empty, right?
Show him.

01:33:30.873 --> 01:33:32.545
I should cast a spell.

01:33:34.884 --> 01:33:36.388
This has to cook them.

01:33:36.622 --> 01:33:40.099
Wanna say a few things.
First I'd like to say season’s greetings,

01:33:41.001 --> 01:33:45.146
then I'd like to say, keep your hands
on the table at all the times.

01:33:47.986 --> 01:33:49.023
Boo!

01:33:54.102 --> 01:33:57.144
I wanna go home. Please, let me go.

01:33:57.511 --> 01:33:58.949
Are you old?

01:33:59.718 --> 01:34:01.323
You've broken my mind.

01:34:01.589 --> 01:34:02.926
I'll kill you.

01:34:03.194 --> 01:34:05.032
Can we talk this over?

01:34:07.472 --> 01:34:08.975
I can't wake up!

01:34:09.375 --> 01:34:12.915
I am the dreamer. You are the dream.

01:34:14.751 --> 01:34:15.485
Look.

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:21.128
The only thing that really matters here
is what I'm about to show you.

01:34:42.061 --> 01:34:43.297
That's not it.

01:34:44.733 --> 01:34:46.335
I didn't come all this way...

01:34:46.836 --> 01:34:48.939
for you to tell me
that that's what it is.

01:34:50.308 --> 01:34:53.479
Is there something under that?
Because I don't believe that one.

01:34:57.352 --> 01:34:58.587
It's like a...

01:34:59.088 --> 01:35:01.325
box. A Chinese box.

01:35:02.961 --> 01:35:05.967
You open it and there is another one inside,
and there is another one inside...

01:35:06.233 --> 01:35:08.703
You're not gonna let me see you, are you?

01:35:09.137 --> 01:35:11.341
It is a Chinese box.

01:35:12.443 --> 01:35:15.615
And you're not...
gonna be allowed to see.

01:35:16.917 --> 01:35:20.522
OK? So, just get that clear.

01:35:21.858 --> 01:35:25.030
You're not gonna let us see you.

01:35:25.564 --> 01:35:27.200
That's a good idea.

01:35:59.651 --> 01:36:01.388
One... two, three, shoot!

01:36:05.594 --> 01:36:06.730
Anybody home?

01:36:07.263 --> 01:36:09.000
Dad! Dad!

01:36:11.938 --> 01:36:14.442
What are you doing up?
Why aren't you in school?

01:36:14.608 --> 01:36:17.380
Mom needed me to help her wait for you.

01:36:21.587 --> 01:36:23.056
We are playing war.

01:36:23.523 --> 01:36:27.262
I'm beating the pants off her.
That for sure.

01:36:27.863 --> 01:36:29.700
- I saw them.
- You did?

01:36:30.835 --> 01:36:31.703
Something happened.

01:36:31.770 --> 01:36:32.938
- How are you?
- Good.

01:36:33.005 --> 01:36:35.075
Dad, come here,
I wanna show you something,

01:36:35.142 --> 01:36:37.746
I made a computer game on your computer.

01:36:48.164 --> 01:36:49.231
What happened?

01:36:50.634 --> 01:36:51.769
They danced.

01:36:51.936 --> 01:36:53.205
What kind of dance?

01:36:55.876 --> 01:36:57.578
The bossa nova, how do I know?

01:37:02.251 --> 01:37:04.489
They let me know that I...

01:37:06.359 --> 01:37:07.360
was...

01:37:08.462 --> 01:37:09.664
chosen...

01:37:11.934 --> 01:37:13.136
for something.

01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:14.304
And...

01:37:15.974 --> 01:37:18.311
they invited me to come with them.

01:37:21.616 --> 01:37:23.319
I had the feeling, forever.

01:37:27.292 --> 01:37:28.695
Then it was morning.

01:37:40.546 --> 01:37:42.971
- They asked you to go away with them?
- Yeah.

01:37:44.997 --> 01:37:47.090
I just came home to get my stuff.

01:37:50.346 --> 01:37:52.638
You don't have a mark
on the back of your head.

01:37:54.033 --> 01:37:55.793
I can give you that one.

01:38:14.028 --> 01:38:18.181
You need a theory, you know, it's just
not strange enough, to account for...

01:38:19.675 --> 01:38:21.270
for the facts.

01:38:21.602 --> 01:38:24.094
If we're talking about
what they know about us,

01:38:24.326 --> 01:38:26.685
you'd have to... you would have to consider
that they...

01:38:27.914 --> 01:38:31.070
they could be sitting at home tonight
watching "The Honeymooners".

01:38:31.768 --> 01:38:33.860
Like Ralph and Alice... like us.

01:38:34.027 --> 01:38:35.687
That's why they picked on me.

01:38:36.684 --> 01:38:38.311
You know what I think?

01:38:38.876 --> 01:38:40.458
I don't think it matters.

01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:47.218
Whatever it is,
they know what's the way of television...

01:38:47.387 --> 01:38:48.968
and thing like that.

01:38:51.895 --> 01:38:54.687
If... if we're talking about light years..

01:38:54.855 --> 01:38:57.983
tonight they're watching the first episode
"The Father Knows Best".

01:38:58.723 --> 01:39:01.683
It would be narcissistic of us
to feel alone in the universe.

01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:05.046
People used to think that the world
was flat, you know, the centre of things.

01:39:05.113 --> 01:39:07.805
That excludes the possibility of visitors.

01:39:07.973 --> 01:39:12.038
That's really another kind of...
of the same kind thinking.

01:39:13.657 --> 01:39:18.781
The world is getting so small, that
it would be nice to meet someone new.

01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:22.482
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know...

01:39:24.102 --> 01:39:25.623
I don't know what you saw.

01:39:28.035 --> 01:39:30.051
What is it matter?
It doesn't matter.

01:39:30.745 --> 01:39:32.187
It's just God.

01:39:33.730 --> 01:39:37.620
You saw something extraordinary?
There are many faces of God.

01:39:39.464 --> 01:39:41.275
Masks of God.

01:39:42.952 --> 01:39:45.266
Our history is a response to their presence.

01:39:45.433 --> 01:39:50.865
They might be what the face of evolution
looks like on the response to...

01:39:51.737 --> 01:39:53.683
a conscious mind.

01:39:54.823 --> 01:39:56.198
You know something?

01:40:00.624 --> 01:40:02.154
It frightened me.

01:40:03.616 --> 01:40:05.844
Because you went so far away...

01:40:10.932 --> 01:40:12.262
but you're back...

01:40:14.190 --> 01:40:15.620
you're different.

01:40:18.213 --> 01:40:20.242
I think they gave you something.

01:40:23.501 --> 01:40:26.360
I do. I think they gave you a gift.

01:40:29.785 --> 01:40:31.304
You'd better use it.

01:40:34.104 --> 01:40:36.104
Look what I've got for you.

01:40:36.204 --> 01:40:38.204
Mandarin pressed duck.

01:40:38.304 --> 01:40:40.804
A beautiful bottle of Bordeaux.

01:40:40.904 --> 01:40:43.204
I'm gonna drop that book,
you know, that I'm writing.

01:40:43.304 --> 01:40:44.304
Oh yeah?

01:40:44.404 --> 01:40:46.104
What are you gonna do?
Drive a cab?

01:40:46.204 --> 01:40:47.704
I'm gonna write about this.

01:40:49.104 --> 01:40:50.104
Us.

01:40:50.704 --> 01:40:52.704
I'm gonna write about what I know.

01:40:54.804 --> 01:40:56.204
I like that look in your eyes.

01:40:56.304 --> 01:40:57.804
I'm gonna do it right now.

01:40:59.104 --> 01:41:00.804
Watch this.

01:41:10.803 --> 01:41:12.303
Watch out!

01:41:12.403 --> 01:41:13.903
Whitley is back!

01:41:18.706 --> 01:41:20.299
You're sleeping?

01:41:23.584 --> 01:41:26.438
Like this:
I gotta know, I gotta know what is...

01:41:26.698 --> 01:41:29.393
Look at this, Anne, wake up, wake up.

01:41:29.559 --> 01:41:31.056
I got this great.

01:41:31.223 --> 01:41:33.884
It's the first chapter, look, look, awake.

01:41:38.110 --> 01:41:39.242
OK, OK.

01:41:40.539 --> 01:41:45.097
I've got this great first chapter.
I got such an idea. About how to start.

01:42:17.104 --> 01:42:19.366
Andy... Andy wake up.

01:42:19.532 --> 01:42:21.728
Come on, come on.
Wake up.

01:42:22.029 --> 01:42:23.359
I'll show you something.

01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:31.744
Whitley...

01:42:51.374 --> 01:42:53.183
What's going on?

01:42:55.761 --> 01:42:58.340
- What are we doing?
- It was a huge light.

01:42:58.373 --> 01:42:59.981
Are we searching for something?

01:43:02.892 --> 01:43:04.366
What are we doing?

01:43:05.773 --> 01:43:07.447
Mom, what are we doing?

01:43:07.882 --> 01:43:09.289
Nothing.

01:43:09.457 --> 01:43:11.402
Let's go back to bed.

01:43:13.248 --> 01:43:15.655
You think it could have been a plane?
Helicopter?

01:43:20.107 --> 01:43:23.075
- So beautiful. You see the moon?
- Let's go back.

01:43:30.066 --> 01:43:32.867
Andy, wait, wait... come here.
Come here...

01:44:00.406 --> 01:44:04.431
Maybe we do have an afterlife,
but not quite in the way...

01:44:04.538 --> 01:44:06.601
tradition suggests.

01:44:06.735 --> 01:44:11.301
Maybe you and I are larvae,
and the "visitors"...

01:44:11.435 --> 01:44:14.450
are human beings in the mature form.

01:44:14.552 --> 01:44:18.913
Certainly, we are consuming
our planet's resources...

01:44:24.592 --> 01:44:30.425
But in state, I'm sure in transform...

01:44:31.009 --> 01:44:33.889
astronomers of India believed...

01:44:39.831 --> 01:44:41.946
Why call a book...

01:44:44.206 --> 01:44:46.904
...about you?

01:45:21.276 --> 01:45:27.316
<i>The Striebers continue to live in
their cabin in upstate New York.</i>

01:45:27.716 --> 01:45:35.476
<i>By October 1989, nineteen other people
had encountered similar unknown beings there.</i>
