I don't know
what to do anymore.

41:49.716 --> 41:52.503
I don't know how
to change things.

41:52.635 --> 41:56.127
You're asking me how to make
the world a better place?

41:56.264 --> 41:59.381
You're not as hard or as cold
as you want us all to think.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.132
Don't forget -- I was there

42:01.269 --> 42:03.726
when you opened your eyes
for the first time.

42:10.737 --> 42:13.649
Astrid said something to me
just before the explosion.

42:13.781 --> 42:17.444
She wished I could be
out with her as myself

42:17.577 --> 42:20.319
instead of hiding behind these.

42:20.455 --> 42:23.913
I saw then we will never be sure
of our place in the world

42:24.042 --> 42:25.282
while we still have to hide.

42:25.418 --> 42:26.328
I don't hide.

42:26.461 --> 42:28.122
Then what are you doing
at the railyard?

42:28.254 --> 42:31.542
What would you have us do?
Live openly among them?

42:34.552 --> 42:36.588
I tried.

42:36.721 --> 42:41.340
There was a human.

42:41.476 --> 42:44.013
I showed him what I was.

42:44.145 --> 42:48.013
I thought there was a bond.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.228
He betrayed me.

42:52.487 --> 42:55.900
Just one experience like that,

42:56.032 --> 43:01.197
one person like that,
can define us.

43:01.329 --> 43:04.492
But only if we let them.

43:04.624 --> 43:06.580
You will find a way.

43:19.388 --> 43:23.722
SAM: I spy with my little eye
something beginning with...

43:23.851 --> 43:25.307
KAREN: [ Laughs] Hello.
Come on, Sam.

43:25.436 --> 43:27.051
-MAN: He won't bite.
-KAREN: Let's go home.

43:27.188 --> 43:29.304
-SAM: I'd like a dog one day.
-MAN: Bye-bye.

43:29.440 --> 43:30.850
SAM:
Maybe we could have one.

43:30.983 --> 43:33.065
I'd take it for walks
every day and play with it.

43:33.194 --> 43:35.435
KAREN: I've always
been frightened of small dogs.

43:35.571 --> 43:38.108
Do you like small dogs
or big ones?

43:56.050 --> 43:58.712
It is you.
Isn't it?

44:00.596 --> 44:03.303
The last one.

44:06.185 --> 44:07.766
You must know where you are.

44:11.232 --> 44:13.223
All I have to do
is yell "dolly."

44:16.154 --> 44:17.940
Who's he?
Where's his family?

44:19.699 --> 44:21.655
Can I make you
a cup of tea, Joe?

44:30.793 --> 44:32.249
Stay where you are.

44:32.378 --> 44:35.461
Don't -- Don't come any closer
than that.

44:37.133 --> 44:38.964
Who is he?

44:39.093 --> 44:40.879
What are you doing here?

44:41.012 --> 44:45.005
Sam, Joe wants to know
who you are.

44:45.141 --> 44:49.726
It's okay.
He's a friend.

44:53.733 --> 44:56.770
How are Laura and the children?

45:12.418 --> 45:15.535
Hello, Joe.
My name is Sam.

45:20.718 --> 45:23.505
-How did you...
-I didn't do anything.

45:23.638 --> 45:26.095
He's a Qualia Global Systems
prototype,

45:26.224 --> 45:29.432
built in secret,
long before Day Zero.

45:29.560 --> 45:31.676
I was with him
when he became conscious.

45:31.812 --> 45:34.098
Since then,
I've taken care of him,

45:34.232 --> 45:38.145
kept moving, staying ahead of
the people who want him back.

45:39.195 --> 45:42.562
What the hell did you bring him
to Waltringham for?

45:42.698 --> 45:44.438
Have you any idea
what they'll do to you both

45:44.575 --> 45:45.485
if you're found out?

45:45.618 --> 45:48.075
Yes. I do.

45:48.204 --> 45:50.365
That's why Qualia
would never look for him here.

45:52.875 --> 45:56.333
And there are no other synths
here who could detect him.

45:56.462 --> 45:58.293
KAREN: If Sam's going to survive
like I did,

45:58.422 --> 46:00.378
he needs to learn how to pass
for human.

46:00.508 --> 46:02.419
Perfectly.

46:03.469 --> 46:06.176
What better place than
a synth-free community?

46:06.305 --> 46:09.923
He needs a home.
He could have a life here.

46:10.059 --> 46:11.139
Please, Joe.

46:21.654 --> 46:25.818
-[ Door closes ]
-Is he really our friend?

46:25.950 --> 46:27.611
I don't know.

46:32.832 --> 46:35.494
[ Breathing heavily]

46:52.768 --> 46:54.269
Agnes?

46:54.395 --> 46:55.805
Charging.

46:58.190 --> 46:59.896
Are you sure about this?

47:00.901 --> 47:03.028
You were right.

47:03.154 --> 47:04.985
I can't guarantee their safety.

47:05.114 --> 47:06.320
Anger is growing.

47:06.449 --> 47:08.064
[Vehicle door closes]

47:08.200 --> 47:10.657
If she found them...

47:17.793 --> 47:19.704
Gordon will take you
as close to a train station

47:19.837 --> 47:21.373
as he can safely go.

47:22.798 --> 47:24.174
Max.

47:27.511 --> 47:28.671
Maxie.

47:37.897 --> 47:40.058
[ Engine starts]

47:40.191 --> 47:42.227
MAX:
Seal the gates!

47:44.653 --> 47:46.905
No one enters.

47:47.031 --> 47:48.771
No one leaves.
