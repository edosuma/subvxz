to breastfeed her Cabbage Patch doll.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.576
It's okay, baby.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.161
If you would've grabbed
the right painting,

11:43.245 --> 11:44.830
we'd all be rich
and never have to worry

11:44.913 --> 11:47.499
about another thing again
for the rest of our lives, but...

11:48.917 --> 11:49.960
It's okay, baby.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.211
It doesn't make any sense.

11:51.294 --> 11:54.005
Why would the Congresswoman steal
her own art and replace it with fakes?

11:54.089 --> 11:56.967
Maybe she's leaving the old guy and this
is her way of getting around the prenup?

11:57.050 --> 11:58.093
[Barb]
Wouldn't blame her.

11:58.176 --> 11:59.594
Can't be easy keepin' a lady boner

11:59.678 --> 12:02.097
while peelin' off
your lover's adult Pampers.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.766
You stay up late enough,
you see it all.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.184
Could be an insurance scheme.

12:06.268 --> 12:08.979
Replace the art, light the house on fire,
and collect the cash?

12:09.062 --> 12:12.566
Whatever it is,
she's up to something.

12:12.649 --> 12:15.068
I say we blackmail her.

12:15.152 --> 12:16.862
[Rooster]
Mom's awesome at blackmailing.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.989
Tell 'em how you saw the mailman
sneaking out of the neighbor's house

12:19.072 --> 12:20.782
when her husband was out of town.

12:20.866 --> 12:22.701
She hasn't put a stamp on a letter since.
Tell 'em.

12:23.577 --> 12:26.538
Basically, what he said.
I just tell it a little funnier.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.582
We don't even know
what the Congresswoman is hiding.

12:28.665 --> 12:32.002
So? I'll just keep watchin'
the cameras until she slips up.

12:32.085 --> 12:35.255
Trust me,
blackmail is my specialty,

12:35.338 --> 12:39.384
along with casseroles,
winemaking, and prostate play.

12:39.468 --> 12:41.094
Mom crushes that shit.

12:41.178 --> 12:42.721
He means the first three.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.890
We're not blackmailing a Congresswoman.
It's too risky.

12:44.973 --> 12:45.932
Uh, way too risky.

12:46.016 --> 12:47.684
Oh, I see.

12:47.767 --> 12:52.272
So, for weeks, Rooster and I
just blindly follow along with your plan,

12:52.355 --> 12:54.024
assuming you know what you're doing,

12:54.107 --> 12:56.485
and now that it blew up
in your face, you're quitting?

12:56.568 --> 12:59.446
I'm not quitting, Barb.
It's just, I'm a con artist.

12:59.529 --> 13:02.407
I have standards.
Blackmailing is a little beneath me.

13:02.491 --> 13:05.785
So, I'm beneath you?
Is that what you're sayin'?

13:05.869 --> 13:06.912
No, she didn't mean anything by it.

13:06.995 --> 13:07.913
I just don't think it's smart.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.373
So you're callin' me stupid?

13:10.457 --> 13:11.666
I'll blackmail her with you, Mom.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.168
[Barb]
Thank you. You see?

13:13.251 --> 13:16.546
Even Rooster thinks it's a good idea,
and he actually is a little slow.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.131
I'm sorry, Roo.
I'm just makin' a point.

13:18.215 --> 13:19.090
Sorry for what?

13:19.174 --> 13:21.885
Why don't you just admit it?

13:21.968 --> 13:26.431
You look at me,
and all you see is a clown.

13:26.515 --> 13:29.059
Whoa. No one's callin' anyone a clown.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.644
You know, maybe this is all a blessing.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.562
We didn't have a fence
to move the painting anyway.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.189
I'm sorry. What?

13:34.272 --> 13:35.398
We would have found someone.

13:36.149 --> 13:39.653
You knew about this?
So, you're keepin' secrets now?

13:39.736 --> 13:42.948
Well, I wouldn't call it a secret. I mean,
we haven't really had time to talk.

13:43.031 --> 13:43.865
Barb, you're being silly.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.617
Silly?

13:45.700 --> 13:49.454
My son may never be able
to open a pickle jar for me again,

13:49.538 --> 13:51.706
and you didn't even have a buyer lined up?

13:51.790 --> 13:55.627
I had one, but he got spooked
when he saw the cops in the front yard

13:55.710 --> 13:58.672
because you stole the neighbor's
fizzy water thing, like a dumbass!

13:58.755 --> 14:01.132
There it is!
Dumbass!

14:01.216 --> 14:05.220
I need to consult the encyclopedia, but I
think that might be even worse than clown.

14:05.303 --> 14:08.056
You know what?
I think we're done here.

14:08.139 --> 14:10.725
I agree.
Let's all just get a little sleep.

14:10.809 --> 14:12.852
I think we're all a little tired
and stressed out.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.938
I, for one, would like a warm milk.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.189
Anyone else like one?

14:16.273 --> 14:17.983
No, I mean we're done.

14:18.066 --> 14:20.235
I've been feedin'
and housin' you two for weeks,

14:20.318 --> 14:21.861
and what do I have to show for it?

14:21.945 --> 14:23.613
I thought, at the very least, one of you

14:23.697 --> 14:25.782
might do something about that crow
that wakes me up every morning.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.910
But no, no, that's Barb's problem.

14:28.994 --> 14:32.831
And you, takin' this bitch's side
after all I've done for you.

a bitch, bitch!

14:42.132 --> 14:43.466

I was holding my own hand.

We were getting married.

They were so proud of me.

Whoa. Huh.

22:41.819 --> 22:42.945
Oh.

22:45.656 --> 22:46.783
Mm.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.410
[sniffles] How do I look?

22:49.494 --> 22:50.620
It's a phone call.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.538
You could've just said great.

22:52.622 --> 22:53.456
-Uh...
-[phone rings]

22:53.539 --> 22:56.042
-I really appreciate you...
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:56.125 --> 22:56.959
[Anna] Hello?

22:57.043 --> 22:59.504
Hi, it's me. It's Gloria... me.

22:59.587 --> 23:01.672
[Anna]
Are you drunk? It's the middle of the day.

23:01.756 --> 23:05.927
No, I'm not. I'm...
I... I have a question. Um...

23:06.969 --> 23:09.722
Do you think you could... [sighs]

23:09.806 --> 23:11.140
Is there any way you could, um...

23:11.224 --> 23:12.975
[Anna]
Gloria, this isn't really a great time.

23:13.059 --> 23:16.312
I'm volunteering at the food pantry.
Did you get arrested again?

23:16.395 --> 23:18.189
-'Cause I'm not gonna...
-No, I'm not in jail.

23:18.272 --> 23:20.691
It's complicated, okay? I, uh...

23:20.775 --> 23:22.527
Just, I... I need, uh...

23:22.610 --> 23:23.945
Bye, Anna. You suck.

23:24.028 --> 23:24.862
[phone beeps]

23:24.946 --> 23:26.239
What are you doing?

23:26.322 --> 23:27.782
You don't have to ask her.

23:27.865 --> 23:29.575
Are you gonna ask your parents?

23:29.659 --> 23:30.993
No.

23:32.286 --> 23:34.539
I have a better idea.

23:34.622 --> 23:35.623
[dog barks in distance]

23:37.834 --> 23:40.169
You sure this is safe?

23:40.253 --> 23:44.298
Don't worry, someone told me
exactly how to rob this house.

23:44.382 --> 23:45.216
Who?

23:48.761 --> 23:50.346
Her.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.431
[funk music plays]

23:54.433 --> 23:55.768
Hey.

23:55.852 --> 23:58.604
Rooster's talkin' about watchin' a movie
if you're interested.

23:58.771 --> 24:01.023
No can do.

24:01.107 --> 24:05.695
Jean Michel Duklon and I
do all of our sexy texting on Sundays.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.781
The Lord rests on the seventh day,

24:08.865 --> 24:12.785
so I like to get my naughtiest
when he's not lookin'.

24:12.869 --> 24:16.831
It gets pretty wild.
I have a safe emoji.

24:16.914 --> 24:20.585
If you see a sock on the bedroom door,
do not disturb.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.465
[funk music continues]

24:32.889 --> 24:34.390
And here's the bathroom.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.726
You'll wanna do your showering
during the day.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.352
That window doesn't fully close,

24:38.436 --> 24:41.230
so your willy
is gonna get chilly at night.

Oh...

25:03.085 --> 25:07.757
If you wake up in the night,
make sure you step on the right stains.

25:07.840 --> 25:12.803
Otherwise, the stairs will squeak
and you'll wake up the whole damn house.

25:14.347 --> 25:17.350
[stairs squeaking]

25:19.769 --> 25:21.771
[funk music continues]

25:29.111 --> 25:31.280
I hope that's everything.

25:31.364 --> 25:33.115
We have to load up your bank account.

25:33.199 --> 25:36.035
Oh, don't worry, it's all here.

25:36.118 --> 25:39.538
All except my emergency health fund.

25:41.540 --> 25:42.541
Oh.

25:44.418 --> 25:46.420
[funk music continues]

25:55.054 --> 25:57.890
If you're hungry,
I hide all the snack foods under the sink,

25:57.974 --> 25:59.934
or Rooster eats it all in one day.

26:02.561 --> 26:05.273
You're gonna wanna be careful, though.

26:05.356 --> 26:08.401
Pay attention to the first couple bites.

26:08.484 --> 26:11.320
If the jerky tastes like bleach,
there's been a leak.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.574

Oh, what the hell, man?

26:57.700 --> 26:59.535
What the hell are you doing in here?

26:59.618 --> 27:01.954
-I... I couldn't fall asleep.
-Oh, my God.

27:02.038 --> 27:03.622
So, Mom drove me around

27:03.706 --> 27:05.583
until I passed out
like when I was a baby.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.960
But now I'm too big to carry inside.

27:08.044 --> 27:10.254
What the hell is goin' on?

27:11.922 --> 27:13.841
Are you two stealin' my car?

27:13.924 --> 27:15.384
And my snacks?

27:15.468 --> 27:16.510
And my son?

27:16.594 --> 27:18.679
Well, what did you expect, Barb?

27:18.763 --> 27:20.473
You kicked us out of the house
without any money.

27:20.556 --> 27:21.766
We gotta survive somehow.

27:21.849 --> 27:23.392
I was about to fight a pigeon
over a Dorito.

27:23.476 --> 27:27.480
[sighs] It was either rob you
or call our families and beg for money.

27:27.563 --> 27:28.898
We didn't wanna look like failures.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.733
We... We didn't want them
to think that we were...

27:30.816 --> 27:33.861
Beneath them?
Like they're better than you?

27:33.944 --> 27:35.696
Like you're a couple of clowns?

27:35.780 --> 27:37.198
Like exactly what you did to me

27:37.281 --> 27:39.283
in case you're not pickin' up
what I'm puttin' down?

27:39.367 --> 27:40.993
No, I get it.

27:41.077 --> 27:44.288
I'm sorry. You're right.
I shouldn't have said those things.

27:46.874 --> 27:51.545
Well, it just... kinda stung a little
'cause I thought we were gal pals.

27:51.629 --> 27:53.839
We are. We are.

27:53.923 --> 27:56.592
And I don't think
that I'm better than you.

27:56.675 --> 27:58.302
If anything, you're better than me.

27:58.386 --> 28:03.682
I wouldn't have welcomed convicts
into my home, clothed them, fed them...

28:03.766 --> 28:05.601
Put Jolly Ranchers
on their pillows at night.

28:05.684 --> 28:06.769
[chuckles]

28:06.852 --> 28:09.313
What? You haven't done that
for me in years.

28:09.397 --> 28:12.608
You don't suck 'em fast enough and you
end up with half a Rancher in your mouth,

28:12.691 --> 28:13.692
and it's a choking hazard.

28:13.776 --> 28:15.194
That's true. I am a slow sucker.

28:15.277 --> 28:20.116
Look, the point is,
we are really lucky to have met you.

28:20.199 --> 28:23.994
And if you think that blackmailing
the Congresswoman is a good idea,

28:24.078 --> 28:24.912
then I am more than happy...

28:24.995 --> 28:27.957
I don't just think it's a good idea.
I know it's a good idea.

Wait till you see what Rooster found out.
Come on.

Honey, honey, calm down.
You're gonna have another heart attack.

29:05.119 --> 29:07.246
If he's gonna die,
I don't wanna watch this.

29:07.329 --> 29:10.583
It's fake. I replaced all the art.

29:10.666 --> 29:11.917
The real stuff's
in the condo in New York.

29:12.001 --> 29:13.252
I'm gonna sell it.

29:13.335 --> 29:15.754
Did you tell me this before?
Am I losing my mind?

29:15.838 --> 29:17.548
No, I didn't tell you
for your own good.

29:17.631 --> 29:20.426
Remember how nervous you got
when I told you I used insider trading

29:20.509 --> 29:21.677
to get out of the stock market?

29:21.760 --> 29:24.346
Oh, yeah.
Had a heart attack.

29:24.430 --> 29:25.681
Had to start wearing diapers.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.600

29:27.683 --> 29:29.101
[Paula]
Now, try to stay calm.

29:29.185 --> 29:31.520
I figured out a way to save
and make a fortune.

29:31.604 --> 29:33.439
Right after we approve the vaccine,

29:33.522 --> 29:37.234
I'll know exactly which drug companies
to invest in before anyone else.

29:37.318 --> 29:38.694
Oh, this bitch is evil.

29:38.777 --> 29:42.114
[Horace] But the IRS
is already all over us for that last deal.

29:42.198 --> 29:46.785
Which is why I had our housekeeper
open up an account in her name,

29:46.869 --> 29:51.415
giving us full access so we can
contribute to her kid's college fund.

29:51.499 --> 29:53.834
We'll run it all through there.
That way, if we get caught...

29:53.918 --> 29:57.129
It'll look like
the housekeeper robbed us.

29:57.213 --> 29:58.047
[both laugh]

29:58.130 --> 29:59.215
Bingo!

-Oh!

30:01.217 --> 30:02.676
Mmm.

30:02.760 --> 30:03.969
Wow.

30:04.053 --> 30:04.887
Huh? What'd I tell you?

30:04.970 --> 30:07.431
She's dirty as hell
and we've got it all on tape.

30:07.515 --> 30:10.226
I bet you we could
blackmail her for 200 grand.

30:10.309 --> 30:13.854
We should get the dog too.
I can tell he's tired of all the drama.

30:16.607 --> 30:17.733
Forget the blackmail.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.944
What are you talkin' about?
Well, you heard what she said.

30:20.027 --> 30:21.445
-She...
-Oh, I heard.

30:21.529 --> 30:23.405
She's liquidating all their art,

30:23.489 --> 30:26.659
lying to her housekeeper
about some bogus college fund,

30:26.742 --> 30:30.871
and using inside information to get rich
while the people who voted for her die.

30:30.955 --> 30:32.414
I heard.

30:32.498 --> 30:34.208
We're not gonna blackmail her.

30:34.291 --> 30:35.834
We're gonna make sure
she doesn't get away with it,

30:35.918 --> 30:38.337
and steal every dime she has
while we're at it.

30:38.420 --> 30:40.839
This just turned into a bank robbery.

30:40.923 --> 30:41.757
[Paula exhales deeply]

You're askin' me to cheat
