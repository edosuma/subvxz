WEBVTT

00:08.508 --> 00:09.384
Hey.

00:09.467 --> 00:11.010
- Hey.
- Whatcha doing?

00:11.094 --> 00:12.345
I'm a making a list
of all of Gary's friends

00:12.429 --> 00:13.596
for his birthday party.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.849
How hard is it
to write down Holly?

00:17.225 --> 00:19.269
And what party? You know,
I thought that you always

00:19.352 --> 00:21.104
take him ice skating
at the Sky Rink.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.981
Remember how you said
it was tradition

00:23.064 --> 00:25.734
and I said he's a loser?

00:25.817 --> 00:28.278
Well, I was thinking about
renting out a club this year.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.071
A club? Now, you see,
that's really pricey.

00:30.155 --> 00:32.573
For 17 people,
stick with the Sky Rink.

00:32.656 --> 00:34.909
It's perfect for that dork.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.327
But the Sky Rink's
kind of lame.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.246
I mean, it smells like
diapers and last year

00:38.329 --> 00:40.457
we had to constantly skate
around frozen kid vomit.

00:42.417 --> 00:43.793
Ooh, you're not inviting Henry.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.837
He went to Baltimore
to see his new girlfriend.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.255
Oh, how do you feel
about that?

00:47.338 --> 00:50.133
Well, I got a little twinge.

00:50.216 --> 00:53.887
- I don't see Vince on the list.
- Oh, I hate him.

00:53.970 --> 00:56.639
And by that, do you mean
you still love him?

00:56.723 --> 00:59.100
Yeah, but the love
is mixed in with the hate.

00:59.184 --> 01:02.103
It's a very interesting emotion.
I call it hove.

01:03.688 --> 01:06.775
Ooh, here comes your hover.

01:06.858 --> 01:08.276
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:08.359 --> 01:10.320
So, listen,
tomorrow's Gary's birthday--

01:10.403 --> 01:11.821
I know.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.741
Okay.

01:14.824 --> 01:16.409
So a friend of mine
just bought a club

01:16.493 --> 01:17.911
in SoHo
and there's a room upstairs--

01:17.994 --> 01:19.704
No, I'm sorry.
I'm taking him to the Sky Rink.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.373
- But you just said--
- Sky Rink.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.459
Skating? Isn't that a little--

01:24.542 --> 01:26.920
Awesome? A taste of <i> fantastic?</i>

01:27.003 --> 01:29.005
And Gary loves it.

01:29.088 --> 01:31.424
Gary also loves clubs,
girls, and--

01:31.508 --> 01:33.009
And there it is, girls.

01:33.092 --> 01:35.345
Took you, what, eight seconds?

01:35.428 --> 01:37.013
Girls for Gary.

01:37.096 --> 01:40.517
Sorry, buddy, Sky Rink.
End of convo.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.811
I am freaking out,
freaking out.

01:42.894 --> 01:44.938
- I think I just saw Jill.
- Your Jill?

01:45.021 --> 01:46.940
The Jill who had to move
all the way to France

01:47.023 --> 01:49.317
just to dump you?

01:49.400 --> 01:51.152
That's the one.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.987
Look, I could have swore
I saw her getting on the subway

01:53.071 --> 01:55.073
so I ran after her,
but the doors closed

01:55.156 --> 01:56.491
and then the train
started to take off

01:56.574 --> 01:58.117
and I was chasing it
and I was yelling

01:58.201 --> 02:00.578
you know, "Jill, Jill,"
but I couldn't catch it.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.038
And then there was this man
with no pants

02:02.121 --> 02:04.290
who said he'd be Jill
for a dollar.

I'm telling you, it's just
gonna take a little time.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.218
You and Vince, you just
got to let it cool down.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.720
Then you can go back
to being friends.

02:58.803 --> 03:01.306
No, you can't be friends
with somebody you've been with.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.016
Yes, you..

03:03.099 --> 03:05.894
Wait, what-what do you mean
by been with?

03:08.021 --> 03:10.899
Belated congrats.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.776
No. I haven't
been with, been with.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.445
I mean emotionally, you know?

03:15.528 --> 03:17.614
We let each other know..

03:17.697 --> 03:20.283
Look, we just can't be friends.

03:20.366 --> 03:22.660
Come here.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.746
Oh, thank God.
You haven't done it.

03:26.581 --> 03:29.083
You can tell just by looking
in her eyes?

03:29.167 --> 03:30.919
Do me, do me.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.757
Oh, God, I'm surprised
you can still walk.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.597
Maybe I should just
never see him again.

03:42.680 --> 03:45.683
No, don't say that. Trust me.
It's just gonna take time.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.895
Like today, my ex-boyfriend
from high school

03:48.978 --> 03:50.521
is coming over
to take me to lunch

03:50.605 --> 03:52.774
and we have become good friends.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.485
Easy for you to say.
He's engaged.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.696
Hey, was Rick the first guy
you'd ever been with?

03:58.780 --> 04:01.699
[scoffs]
I've never been with Rick.

04:01.783 --> 04:05.495
[chuckles]
Oh, please.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.330
My room was right next door
to yours.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.582
I heard what was going on.

04:11.084 --> 04:14.003
Oh, God! You were only six.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.547
I know. At first,
I thought he was killing you.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.134
[knock on door]

04:20.218 --> 04:21.844
Okay, that must be

04:21.928 --> 04:23.888
my ex-boyfriend/current friend
Rick.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.182
Let me show you
how this is done.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.895
- Hi.
- Hey. Hey.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.106
Hey, Holly. Hey, Lauren.
How's it going?

04:33.189 --> 04:37.193
- Oh, still dating a doctor.
- So you dating anyone?

04:37.276 --> 04:38.778
Yeah, I just told you,
I'm dating a doctor.

04:38.861 --> 04:41.781
I know. I just know
how much you like to say it.

04:41.864 --> 04:43.324
I love him.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.659
So, listen,
before we go to lunch

04:44.742 --> 04:46.577
I just wanted
to show you something.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.205
Julie and I are getting
wedding gifts for each other

04:49.288 --> 04:52.333
and I was wondering..

04:52.417 --> 04:55.169
...is this brooch any good?

04:55.253 --> 04:58.840
- Oh, that's hideous.
- Lauren.

04:58.923 --> 05:00.925
No, I'm sorry. It's pretty.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.178
Is it bad?

05:04.262 --> 05:07.932
It's not so much bad
as is Julie 80?

05:09.600 --> 05:12.311
I thought it was pretty
and it's very expensive.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.772
Hmm, what'd it set you back?

05:14.856 --> 05:17.608
- Oh, God.
- Sucker.

05:19.402 --> 05:22.238
Uh, look, I don't know Julie,
but, um

05:22.322 --> 05:24.240
a woman usually likes
something personal

05:24.323 --> 05:27.535
or intimate or,
you know, sentimental.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.495
Something between
the two of you.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.914
I wish I knew
what she was getting you.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.000
Oh, I know.
She already gave it to me.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.919
- Oh, what is it?
- A Mercedes.

05:38.713 --> 05:41.174
And you're giving her
that hideous brooch?

05:45.303 --> 05:47.096
Hey, my boyfriend
drives a Mercedes.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.431
Oh, really?

05:48.514 --> 05:50.266
What does your boyfriend
do for a living?

05:50.349 --> 05:52.727
He's a doctor.
Come here, you.

06:00.526 --> 06:01.527
[knock on door]

06:01.611 --> 06:03.780
Come in.

06:03.863 --> 06:06.074
- Hey.
- Hey, birthday boy.

06:06.157 --> 06:08.201
Yeah, that's me.

06:08.284 --> 06:10.995
Birthday boy.
Happy birthday, Gary.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.501
This is a nice room.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.795
Yeah, I like this room.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.713
Very-very comfortable, you know?

06:20.797 --> 06:23.049
We've had a lot of good talks
in this room, haven't we?

06:23.132 --> 06:25.134
- We sure have.
- Yeah.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.387
Hey, you remember that time,
I got into a big fight

06:28.471 --> 06:30.556
with my dad
and you helped me calm down?

06:30.640 --> 06:33.851
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.978
Hey, and you remember that time
that Jill broke up with me

06:36.062 --> 06:38.731
and went back to Paris and, uh,
you helped me through that?

06:38.815 --> 06:40.233
Mm-hmm, yeah.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.653
And you remember that time
that I-I was thinking

06:43.736 --> 06:45.029
about taking up golfing and--

06:45.113 --> 06:47.573
Gary, I don't remember
all of them.

06:47.657 --> 06:51.035
Well, you know,
the reason I bring it up is..

06:51.119 --> 06:53.871
You know, I-I don't wanna
go skating on my birthday.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.164
What? What?

06:55.248 --> 06:56.749
Well, see, yeah,
I was talking to Vince

06:56.833 --> 06:58.501
and he said that his boy
owns this club that--

06:58.584 --> 06:59.794
Vince, unbelievable.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.295
So you would rather go to a club

07:01.379 --> 07:03.464
and dance with girls
than ice skate?

07:05.091 --> 07:06.509
Well, you pose
an interesting question--

07:06.592 --> 07:08.970
Oh, my God.
I can't believe you.

07:09.053 --> 07:10.847
You are choosing Vince over me.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.141
I'm not choosing anybody
over anybody.

07:13.224 --> 07:15.143
Hey, and don't make this
about y'all's thing.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.978
Look, Holly,
I need to get over Jill.

07:17.061 --> 07:18.771
This is not the first time
I thought I saw her.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.398
I mean, I got to get her
out of my head

07:20.481 --> 07:22.567
so maybe I should meet some
girls and Vince said that--

07:22.650 --> 07:24.527
Fine. Go.
Go to Vince's little club.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.279
Go meet girls. You two have fun.

07:26.362 --> 07:27.697
You sure are
bringing up Vince a lot.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.992
Okay, you know what,
this has nothing to do with..

07:31.075 --> 07:33.369
...that guy, okay?

07:33.452 --> 07:35.371
I look forward
to your birthday every year.

07:35.454 --> 07:37.331
Being together,
strapping on the blades

07:37.415 --> 07:40.209
zipping around the old rink.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.962
- We still can be together.
- Forget it.

07:43.045 --> 07:44.672
Oh, come on, Holly, be real.

07:44.755 --> 07:48.217
I am a man. I need
to dance with some girls.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.011
Fine. Go.
Go dance with girls.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.804
Go dance with Vince.
See if I care.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.307
Okay, if that's the way it is,
then that's the way it is.

07:54.390 --> 07:55.600
Yeah, well,
that is the way it is.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.852
Now get off my property.

08:14.035 --> 08:17.205
Are you happy now, huh?
Huh? Huh?

08:18.789 --> 08:20.958
- Problem?
- Yeah. Outside right now.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.501
Can't. I got
a grilled cheese going.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.879
If I leave it,
it's gonna congeal.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.595
Would you give me
back my sandwich?

08:32.678 --> 08:33.888
Hey.

08:33.971 --> 08:35.431
Why are you trying
to drive a wedge

08:35.514 --> 08:37.099
between me
and my best friend?

08:37.183 --> 08:38.768
You went behind my back
and told Gary

08:38.851 --> 08:40.102
about the club
and those girls.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.437
Okay, you're getting
a little loud.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.605
Well, I'm gonna get louder.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.649
Listen, Gary was
at my apartment.

08:44.732 --> 08:45.942
We're having a conversation.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.735
I casually mentioned
a thing about the club.

08:47.818 --> 08:50.279
- Oh, you casually mentioned?
- It just came up.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.990
Oh, my God.
You are such a liar.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.951
I'm a liar?
You know what? You're right.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.786
I am a liar,
because Gary brought it up

08:56.869 --> 08:58.579
and there was
nothing casual about it.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.039
I believe his exact words were

09:00.122 --> 09:03.334
"How can I get out of going
to that stupid Sky Rink?"

09:03.417 --> 09:05.795
You know, I think you're just
using Gary's birthday

09:05.878 --> 09:08.631
as an excuse to be
with a bunch of girls.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.800
I don't need Gary
to be with a bunch of girls.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.468
- I got plenty of girls.
- Oh.

09:12.551 --> 09:13.761
So that's what
this is about?

09:13.844 --> 09:15.304
You started this whole thing
just to tell me

09:15.388 --> 09:17.265
how many girls you have.

09:17.348 --> 09:19.267
Yes, that was my master plan.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.310
I came here hoping
to run into you

09:21.394 --> 09:23.020
to get you to pick
a fight with me

09:23.104 --> 09:25.648
so I could blurt out
how many girlfriends I have.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.193
I knew it.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.611
Okay, I thought
we were talking

09:30.695 --> 09:32.154
about Gary, but you wanna
talk about you and me?

09:32.238 --> 09:33.781
- Let's talk about you and me.
- Okay, fine.

09:33.864 --> 09:35.658
Let's talk about
you and me.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.703
Go ahead.
What do you have to say?

09:38.786 --> 09:42.164
- You're a baby.
- Oh, I'm a baby?

09:42.248 --> 09:44.542
You're a doody.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.252
You know, anytime
something doesn't go

09:46.335 --> 09:48.963
according to Holly's plan
and if it isn't exactly

09:49.046 --> 09:53.134
how you pictured it,
you act like a spoiled baby.

09:53.217 --> 09:55.970
You know, I have gone over it
in my head a million times

09:56.053 --> 09:57.513
whether it was the right thing
to walk away from you

09:57.596 --> 09:59.765
and I have never been surer
than right now.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.058
Good, then we're both happy.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.643
Oh, I think I'm happier
than you.

10:02.727 --> 10:05.062
In fact, I couldn't be happier,
even if I..

10:05.146 --> 10:07.523
Jill?

10:07.606 --> 10:10.484
- Jill?
- Oh, hi, Holly. Hi, Vince.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.528
- So Gary did see you.
- He saw me?

10:12.611 --> 10:13.946
Yeah, this afternoon,
on the subway.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.906
Oh, you guys can't tell Gary
you saw me.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.909
- What are you talking about?
- When did you get back?

10:18.993 --> 10:21.245
Okay, here's the thing.

10:22.496 --> 10:25.333
I lied to Gary.
I never went back to France.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.293
I've been here the whole time.

10:27.376 --> 10:29.545
Okay, now
I'm gonna get loud.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.515
You never went back
to France?

10:41.599 --> 10:43.559
You've been here
this whole time.

10:43.642 --> 10:45.436
What the hell?

10:45.519 --> 10:47.897
Wait a minute. Gary took you
to the airport.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.857
Did you fake
getting on a plane?

10:49.940 --> 10:51.942
Yeah, that part was tricky.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.819
- How could you do that to him?
- Oh, God.

10:53.903 --> 10:56.739
- I'm just not good at breakups.
- Not good? You suck.

10:56.822 --> 10:57.907
That's the most hurtful

10:57.990 --> 10:59.658
insensitive thing
I've ever heard.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.243
Look, you don't know
the whole story.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.245
Okay, I would love
to hear this.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.623
- I met somebody else.
- Oh, my God.

11:05.706 --> 11:08.334
Oh, he's the nicest person.
You guys would really like him.

11:08.417 --> 11:11.087
No, no, no, I wouldn't like him
and I don't like you.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.421
Gary is my best friend

11:12.505 --> 11:14.382
and he is the nicest,
sweetest guy ever.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.926
I know. That's exactly
why I couldn't tell him.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.761
- I didn't wanna hurt him.
- Okay, you know what?

11:18.844 --> 11:21.430
This has nothing to do
with protecting Gary's feelings.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.807
You just didn't wanna
screw things up

11:22.890 --> 11:24.183
with your new boyfriend.

11:24.266 --> 11:26.435
I-I can't believe
you're being so mean.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.937
You-you always seemed so nice.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.356
Yeah, well, you had a lot
of people fooled too

11:30.439 --> 11:33.067
with your little soft voice,
big innocent eyes--

11:33.150 --> 11:34.527
Tight little body.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.906
You know, I think
we're done here.

11:38.989 --> 11:40.241
Fine, if you'll excuse me.

11:40.324 --> 11:41.951
No. Where do you think
you're going?

11:42.034 --> 11:43.285
I want some coconut pie.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.622
- No. No pie for you.
- Whatever.

11:46.705 --> 11:48.874
You know, the best thing
that ever happened to Gary

11:48.958 --> 11:51.752
was you two breaking up.
You don't deserve him.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.547
Oh, my God.
Can you believe her?

11:54.630 --> 11:55.965
I know.

11:58.217 --> 12:01.470
Listen, Gary's coming
by my apartment tonight.

12:01.554 --> 12:05.266
- If you want, I'll tell him.
- No, you're not telling him.

12:05.349 --> 12:08.144
- Fine. You tell him.
- No, no one's telling him.

12:08.227 --> 12:10.312
You wanna hurt him
all over again?

12:10.396 --> 12:13.607
- What is wrong with you?
- I think he'd wanna know.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.234
No, I think I know him
better than you

12:15.317 --> 12:16.819
and I know what he needs
and he doesn't need

12:16.902 --> 12:19.655
to hear this,
especially not on his birthday.

12:19.738 --> 12:23.117
Hey, he's a guy. I'm a guy.
I know what guys want.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.618
Guys want you
to be straight with them

12:24.702 --> 12:27.371
and straight guys
don't wanna figure skate.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.540
I know at least
two fairly straight guys

12:29.623 --> 12:32.835
who love to figure ska.. Okay,
why are we fighting about this?

12:32.918 --> 12:35.045
We need to think about Gary.

12:35.129 --> 12:38.549
Okay, if you really don't
think we should tell him

12:38.632 --> 12:42.178
then we won't tell him
even though we should tell him.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.221
Well, we need to do something
really nice for his birthday.

12:44.305 --> 12:48.017
- Can you still get that club?
- I saw it. It's kind of a dump.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.895
- My friend's the worst.
- Well, we can use the loft.

12:50.978 --> 12:53.439
Can you still get girls?

12:53.522 --> 12:55.649
Isn't that, like,
our whole problem?

13:03.616 --> 13:05.784
Yay, I love birthdays.

13:05.868 --> 13:08.329
I love cake.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.915
I love you guys. Mwah.

13:10.998 --> 13:12.374
And mwah.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.254
I think someone's had
a little too much love.

13:18.797 --> 13:20.216
Thanks for letting us
use the loft.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.343
Oh, no problem.
I love Gary.

13:22.426 --> 13:24.512
You and Vince
throwing Gary a party

13:24.595 --> 13:25.846
that's very friend-like.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.098
Yeah, well, we decided
to put our differences aside

13:28.182 --> 13:30.392
and be mature
and adult about it.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.228
Hey, I'm gonna go
light the fire outside.

13:32.311 --> 13:33.687
Who cares?

13:35.397 --> 13:36.941
Val, do you think
I did the right thing

13:37.024 --> 13:38.567
by not telling Gary
about Jill?

13:38.651 --> 13:39.693
I don't know.

13:39.777 --> 13:40.736
What do you mean
you don't know?

13:40.819 --> 13:41.862
Telling him would devastate him

13:41.946 --> 13:43.072
and break his heart.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.448
Okay, you did the right thing.

13:44.532 --> 13:45.866
Exactly.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.870
Ooh.

13:49.954 --> 13:52.581
Hey! Who ripped off my vino?

13:56.335 --> 13:59.255
Okay, I got the fire going.
What do you want me to do now?

13:59.338 --> 14:01.507
Learn how to have
a relationship.

14:03.133 --> 14:05.261
Gary! Hey!

14:05.344 --> 14:08.472
You are bad.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.516
- What?
- I-I saw Jill.

14:10.599 --> 14:12.768
- I know what you're doing.
- You saw her?

14:12.851 --> 14:14.436
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I was hanging out in the subway

14:14.520 --> 14:17.815
thinking she might show up again
and sure enough, she did.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.567
She got on the train
and I started chasing it

14:19.650 --> 14:22.945
but I stopped because, well,
it was way faster than me.

14:23.028 --> 14:27.283
But I know it was her and I know
what you two are up to.

14:27.366 --> 14:30.286
- What are we up to?
- She's here for my birthday.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.537
[laughing]

14:31.620 --> 14:33.872
Busted. Yeah, I got
to give you guys props.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.583
Hey, you really had me fooled.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.376
You and the fake fight
about the Sky Rink

14:37.459 --> 14:39.920
and you with the club
and the girls, I like that.

14:41.714 --> 14:42.798
Gary, listen, man, we--

14:42.881 --> 14:44.550
Don't know anything about Jill.

14:44.633 --> 14:47.803
I don't know who you saw,
but she's not coming here.

14:47.886 --> 14:50.097
Okay, alright.
She's not coming.

14:50.180 --> 14:52.850
[laughs]
Hey, she wants to get back
with me, doesn't she?

14:52.933 --> 14:54.643
I knew it, I knew it.
Hey, you know what?

14:54.727 --> 14:58.647
When two people love each other
that much, you can feel it.

14:58.731 --> 14:59.815
- Dude--
- Hey, Vince.

14:59.898 --> 15:01.984
Could we have a moment, please?

15:02.067 --> 15:04.695
Gary, Jill never left.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.989
She's been here
the whole time. She..

15:07.072 --> 15:08.490
She told you
she was going back to France

15:08.574 --> 15:11.785
because, because it was
easier for her.

15:11.869 --> 15:14.997
Okay, if you're still playing
me, it's not very funny.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.457
I wouldn't do that.

15:17.916 --> 15:19.335
This is for real?

15:21.253 --> 15:24.548
- Well, how long have you known?
- I ran into her yesterday.

15:24.632 --> 15:25.966
Yesterday,
and you didn't tell me?

15:26.050 --> 15:28.135
Gary, I didn't want it
to ruin your birthday.

15:28.218 --> 15:29.762
Birthday? Well, you know
how I feel about that girl.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.221
I mean, if I knew
she was here, I..

15:31.305 --> 15:32.598
I could have talked to her.
I could have--

15:32.681 --> 15:34.183
No, there's nothing
you could have done.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.726
She's seeing somebody else.

15:35.809 --> 15:37.144
Okay, that part
I wouldn't have told him.

15:37.227 --> 15:38.771
I wouldn't have
told him any part.

15:38.854 --> 15:39.938
Look what you did.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.523
If you'd let me
tell him yesterday--

15:41.607 --> 15:43.359
Wait, you were gonna tell me
and you weren't?

15:43.442 --> 15:44.777
Well, Gary,
I didn't want you--

15:44.860 --> 15:46.070
Thanks, Vince.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.571
You're a good friend.

15:53.243 --> 15:55.704
- Holly--
- No, go.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.039
Go find your good friend Gary

15:57.122 --> 15:59.375
and give him the best birthday
ever.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.969
This was a kick-ass
birthday party.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.722
Gary wasn't even here.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.557
I told you Vince and I
couldn't be friends.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.518
He totally sold me out.

16:17.601 --> 16:19.144
Did you see the way
Gary looked at me?

16:19.228 --> 16:21.230
He was so hurt.
I mean, was I wrong?

16:21.313 --> 16:23.649
Should I have told him
yesterday?

16:23.732 --> 16:26.110
You sure he's not
coming back, right?

16:27.194 --> 16:28.570
[knock on door]

16:32.199 --> 16:33.617
- Hey.
- Hey. Is Val here?

16:33.701 --> 16:36.245
Yeah. Val, there's a boy
here for you.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.455
- Rick.
- Hi.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.499
Hi.
Uh, what are you doing here?

16:40.582 --> 16:42.918
I just wanted to drop by
and drop this off

16:43.001 --> 16:44.670
on my way to the airport.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.380
- What did you do?
- Oh, nothing.

16:46.463 --> 16:48.882
It's just a little thank-you
gift for helping me yesterday.

16:48.966 --> 16:52.386
- No, I wanted to do that.
- And I wanted to do this.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.140
Okay.
I can't believe you.

16:57.808 --> 17:01.019
Oh, dear God, look at the size
of that diamond.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.192
- It's a glass doorknob.
- Oh.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.528
Well, glass is nice too.

17:11.905 --> 17:13.574
I can't believe
you remembered this.

17:13.656 --> 17:15.617
Yep, it's pretty much
the exact one

17:15.701 --> 17:19.621
I pulled off your closet door
trying to hide from your dad.

17:19.704 --> 17:20.705
That must have been
one of the nights

17:20.789 --> 17:22.207
he was trying to kill her.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.919
That's very thoughtful.
Thank you.

17:26.002 --> 17:27.796
You're welcome.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.758
Okay, everyone, sit down.
It's movie time.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.676
Ooh, is it "Nemo?"

17:32.760 --> 17:34.261
Holly, come over here.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.390
Hey, Gary, I'm so sorry.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.142
Look, I just want you to know
I don't wanna be here.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.144
- He dragged me here.
- What is this?

17:42.227 --> 17:44.772
Hey, Gary, sit down.
Holly, you sit next to him.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.024
I got the security tape
from outside the diner.

17:47.107 --> 17:49.568
You need to get
a good look at this.

17:49.651 --> 17:51.904
(Holly on TV)
'When did you get back
from France?'

17:51.987 --> 17:55.491
(Jill on TV)
'Okay, here's the thing.'

17:55.574 --> 17:57.534
Wait, that's Jill. Man,
why are you showing me this?

17:57.618 --> 18:00.204
- I thought you were my friend.
- I am.

18:00.287 --> 18:02.831
So is she.
Just keep watching.

18:04.541 --> 18:07.127
You know,
you photograph beautifully.

18:14.718 --> 18:16.303
Wait, wait, I've got
to see this part again.

18:16.386 --> 18:18.347
This is my favorite part.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.349
(Holly on TV)
'You know what, the best thing
that ever happened to Gary'

18:20.432 --> 18:23.685
'was you two breaking up.
You don't deserve him.'

18:23.769 --> 18:25.729
Bam. Look at the look
on her face.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.272
[chuckles]

18:27.356 --> 18:30.025
- My girl.
- Aw.

18:30.108 --> 18:32.402
- Happy birthday, Gary.
- Thank you.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.406
You guys gotta check
this part out.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.784
Now this is
my real, real favorite.

18:40.118 --> 18:42.538
Look how big
Jill's booty looks there.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.999
Damn, I miss that girl.

18:48.043 --> 18:49.795
That was really nice of you.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.839
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.633
Am I still a doody?

18:56.802 --> 19:01.056
Well, I hate to go,
but gotta get to the airport.

19:01.139 --> 19:04.101
No, wait. You haven't
had any ice cream.

19:04.184 --> 19:06.436
Oh, maybe I can stay
for a few more minutes.

19:06.520 --> 19:10.983
After all, it is my good friend
Gay's birthday.

19:11.066 --> 19:13.068
It's Gary.
I ate the R.

19:15.529 --> 19:16.655
Do me a favor.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.991
Next time you and Julie
are in town call me

19:19.074 --> 19:20.742
'cause I would love
to meet her.

19:20.826 --> 19:24.204
- She'd like to meet you too.
- I'm so happy for you.

19:24.288 --> 19:27.249
Getting married, starting
a whole new, exciting life.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.209
That's great.

19:29.293 --> 19:32.087
You know, I gotta say,
when I ran into you in the diner

19:32.170 --> 19:36.049
I was surprised to see that
you haven't been grabbed up yet.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.677
I've been grabbed up.
I just haven't been proposed to.

19:40.512 --> 19:41.763
Well, whoever that guy is

19:41.847 --> 19:43.932
he's not gonna be
good enough for you.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.184
- Probably not.
- Seriously.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.145
You need to find a guy
who really appreciates you

19:48.228 --> 19:51.857
for who you are. You know,
somebody who's totally into you.

19:51.940 --> 19:55.277
You know, a guy who,
who looks at you like..

19:55.360 --> 19:56.862
Like..

19:56.945 --> 19:59.489
Like that guy who's looking
at your sister right now.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.496
- Little help, dude?
- Yeah.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.085
- That guy, what's his name?
- Oh, Rick.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.629
He used to date your sister
in high school, huh?

20:13.712 --> 20:16.298
Yeah, but they're
just friends now.

20:16.381 --> 20:18.467
I don't know about that.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.477
You know, I never really
realized it before

20:28.560 --> 20:31.897
but I believe one of Jill's legs
is shorter than the other.

20:34.024 --> 20:36.193
Damn, I miss that girl.

20:40.322 --> 20:42.115
