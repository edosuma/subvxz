08:53.624 --> 08:55.164
out in the world.

08:55.189 --> 08:57.358
Mom, do you remember that time

08:57.383 --> 08:59.942
you took me to that police training center?

09:00.131 --> 09:02.055
That was amazing.

09:02.135 --> 09:04.586
And I could never have learned
any of that stuff in school.

09:04.611 --> 09:07.694
But you have plenty of time
in your life to go to work.

09:07.719 --> 09:08.950
Okay, Dad.

09:08.975 --> 09:11.091
Do you remember that book
you got me by Bob Dylan?

09:11.116 --> 09:13.958
I learned more about music in the '60s

09:13.983 --> 09:15.533
from that book than I
ever could have learned

09:15.568 --> 09:16.590
from some textbook.

09:16.615 --> 09:18.915
No one is stopping you from
reading in your spare time,

09:18.940 --> 09:20.549
but you only have one more year of school.

09:20.574 --> 09:22.233
A year is an eternity.

09:22.258 --> 09:24.275
I've been home less than a year.

09:24.300 --> 09:25.147
What if someone told you

09:25.172 --> 09:26.890
you had to wait another one to find me?

09:26.915 --> 09:27.997
That's completely different.

09:28.022 --> 09:29.234
We didn't know if you were alive.

09:29.259 --> 09:31.586
I'm not alive when I'm in school.

09:31.611 --> 09:33.394
I don't learn anything there

09:33.419 --> 09:35.432
because I don't care about the stuff

09:35.457 --> 09:36.671
that they're teaching me.

09:36.696 --> 09:38.028
I'm not Taylor.

09:38.053 --> 09:39.937
We don't want you to be Taylor.

09:39.962 --> 09:41.011
But that doesn't mean

09:41.036 --> 09:43.504
you don't need a high school education.

09:43.529 --> 09:44.957
I'm sorry, Carter.

09:44.982 --> 09:47.006

It's fast.

10:04.550 --> 10:05.958
Got up to 90.

10:05.983 --> 10:08.589
He's been living life kinda fast lately.

10:08.614 --> 10:10.062
What are you, his mom now?

10:10.087 --> 10:11.214
No.

10:11.238 --> 10:13.325
But his dad did die not that long ago.

10:13.350 --> 10:14.296
Did you know that?

10:14.321 --> 10:15.618
Yeah, I heard something like that.

10:15.643 --> 10:17.885
Okay, well, he hasn't had
the easiest time since then.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.575
- He told me.
- He told you?

10:19.600 --> 10:21.588
Of course not. We're dudes.

10:23.112 --> 10:25.612
Okay. I'm just saying...

10:25.643 --> 10:27.626
Be careful with him. He's shaking.

10:27.651 --> 10:28.929
I'm not a baby.

10:28.954 --> 10:29.954
And also...

10:29.979 --> 10:32.435
I wouldn't want somebody
talking about me like that.

10:32.460 --> 10:34.689
I'll see you around.

10:39.947 --> 10:42.595
Yeah, good talk.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.283
- (Taylor) Thanks for picking me up.
- (Max) No problem.

10:53.308 --> 10:55.018
What were you talking to Ben about?

10:55.043 --> 10:57.205
Gabe, actually.

10:57.230 --> 10:58.443
Yeah, what about him?

10:58.468 --> 11:00.339
They're hanging out now, I guess.

11:00.364 --> 11:02.437
And I asked Ben to look out for him,

11:02.462 --> 11:04.796
which he has no interest in doing.

11:04.821 --> 11:06.208
I get that.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.383
- You do?
- Sometimes you need to let people

11:08.408 --> 11:09.511
heal on their own.

11:09.536 --> 11:10.752
Yeah.

11:10.787 --> 11:13.371
And sometimes friends need
to look out for each other.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.764
That, too.

11:15.959 --> 11:17.625
Hey, you know what tomorrow is?

11:17.678 --> 11:19.171
No, what?

11:19.196 --> 11:21.429
It's our six-month anniversary.

11:22.398 --> 11:23.981
- Is it?
- Mm-hmm.

11:24.006 --> 11:27.264
We met exactly six months ago.

11:27.746 --> 11:29.412
Wow.

11:29.437 --> 11:31.554
That's so nice that you remembered.

11:31.579 --> 11:33.946
Kind of hard six months to forget.

11:33.971 --> 11:35.253
Mm-hmm.

11:35.278 --> 11:38.752
I thought I would cook
you dinner, celebrate.

11:39.447 --> 11:40.863
You're gonna cook for me?

11:40.888 --> 11:42.137
Well, don't sound so surprised.

11:42.162 --> 11:43.044
I can cook.

11:43.069 --> 11:46.381
Can you make an entire
meal out of croutons?

11:46.406 --> 11:48.156
(laughing)

11:48.208 --> 11:50.168
No, no, I'm kidding.

11:50.193 --> 11:52.726
I would love for you to cook me dinner.

11:52.870 --> 11:54.882
Deal.

11:55.793 --> 12:00.457
I did make...  plans with Gabe.

12:00.482 --> 12:02.417
But I can cancel them.

12:02.442 --> 12:03.704
No, if you already had plans.

12:03.729 --> 12:04.861
No.

12:04.886 --> 12:08.619
You only get one chance at
a six-month anniversary.

12:09.278 --> 12:11.389
And you come first, Max.

12:11.545 --> 12:13.478
Always.

12:16.582 --> 12:18.525
Six months.

12:19.568 --> 12:21.067
What would that be?

12:21.092 --> 12:22.202
Gold?

12:22.227 --> 12:24.143
Silver?

12:24.168 --> 12:26.850
- Plastic?
- Plastic.

12:32.291 --> 12:33.824
- I'm going out.
- Uh...

12:33.858 --> 12:37.860
Which part of the word
"grounded" is confusing?

12:37.885 --> 12:39.320
Not out out.

12:39.406 --> 12:40.572
Study group out.

12:40.597 --> 12:42.771
You're attending a study group.

12:42.796 --> 12:45.264
What can I say? Misery loves company.

12:45.951 --> 12:47.970
And maybe misery could do better in school

12:47.995 --> 12:49.194
if she tries harder.

12:49.219 --> 12:50.319
Whose study group is it?

12:50.344 --> 12:53.012
Some intermediate one
Taylor was too smart for.

Oh, and while you're at it,

13:53.770 --> 13:54.769
will you grab your friend?

18:50.951 --> 18:53.118
Well, you've never been
a traditional student,

18:53.143 --> 18:54.849
even when you were in kindergarten.

18:54.874 --> 18:56.150
I practically taught you math

18:56.175 --> 18:57.758
in our kitchen on Bay Street.

18:57.793 --> 18:58.604
The little table with

18:58.629 --> 19:00.546
the measuring cups and the sugar?

19:00.571 --> 19:02.010
Mm-hmm.

19:03.347 --> 19:04.680
Will you sign it?

19:04.705 --> 19:06.076
(sighing)

19:06.101 --> 19:08.035
I don't know, Carter, I...

19:08.430 --> 19:10.923
I made a promise to stay away,

19:10.948 --> 19:13.860
and I think I know how
they would feel about this.

19:14.886 --> 19:16.499
(sighing)

19:16.524 --> 19:18.746
Why do you want this so much?

19:20.105 --> 19:22.307
I want to be good at something,

19:22.332 --> 19:23.979
something that I choose.

19:24.004 --> 19:25.042
I'm so tired of feeling like

19:25.067 --> 19:27.219
I'm always swimming upstream.

19:27.244 --> 19:29.049
Look, you spent 13 years telling me

19:29.074 --> 19:31.530
you would do anything on
earth to make me happy.

19:31.555 --> 19:33.364
Now is your chance.

19:34.391 --> 19:38.104
You do realize that 99.9% of parents

19:38.129 --> 19:40.251
would never do anything like this, right?

19:41.899 --> 19:44.036
Yes.

19:47.270 --> 19:50.507
Lucky for you, I'm the 1%.

19:57.785 --> 19:59.397
I can't believe you did it.

19:59.422 --> 20:00.505
I had no choice.

20:00.530 --> 20:02.279
Mom and Dad are gonna lose it.

20:02.304 --> 20:03.216
I know.

20:03.249 --> 20:04.699
What did she say when she signed?

20:04.724 --> 20:07.527
She reminded me that most
parents wouldn't do it.

20:07.559 --> 20:08.463
Desperate times call for

20:08.488 --> 20:10.280
desperate measures, I guess.

20:14.273 --> 20:15.518
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:15.543 --> 20:16.992
How is it?

20:17.122 --> 20:18.088
It's good.

20:18.123 --> 20:19.281
Uh, no typos.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.804
That's a rave.

20:21.126 --> 20:22.209
Which part are you on?

20:22.261 --> 20:23.510
The part where we finally get you back

20:23.545 --> 20:24.845
and all you want to do is leave.

20:24.880 --> 20:26.713

21:16.983 --> 21:19.627
We had a little chat about school.

21:21.399 --> 21:22.723
You didn't.

21:22.748 --> 21:24.243
I did.

21:24.268 --> 21:27.744
See, one of the lessons
of motherhood I did learn

21:27.769 --> 21:29.251
is the importance of
truly seeing your child

21:29.276 --> 21:30.676
for who they are.

21:30.701 --> 21:32.836
Carter's never been an academic,

21:32.861 --> 21:34.307
she's never going to be.

21:34.331 --> 21:35.818
So why not end the charade

21:35.843 --> 21:37.224
and just let her start living the life

21:37.249 --> 21:38.194
she's so capable of.

21:53.907 --> 21:54.766
I'm sorry, but I...

21:54.791 --> 21:56.365
You rolled out the welcome mat

21:56.390 --> 21:59.007
and you invited her into our lives.

21:59.032 --> 22:01.561
Did you even give it a second
thought, what you were doing?

22:01.586 --> 22:02.739

22:08.400 --> 22:10.095
No, that's not what I was doing.

22:10.128 --> 22:11.632
Well, that's what you did, Carter.

22:11.657 --> 22:12.906
You set up this dynamic

22:12.931 --> 22:16.454
and now she thinks we're
all playing this sick game.

22:18.899 --> 22:21.784

I only went because I knew
you guys wouldn't sign it.

That doesn't justify what
you did, not for a second.

22:35.173 --> 22:37.256
I'm not trying to justify it.

22:37.281 --> 22:38.832

Five laps or you get your ass out of here.
