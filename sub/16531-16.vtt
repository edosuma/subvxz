00:01.369 --> 00:03.537
ANNOUNCER: Thanks for
downloading this Fox show.

00:03.571 --> 00:05.739
And don't miss
all-new episodes on Fox.

00:08.609 --> 00:09.577
Previously on Empire...
RHONDA: Andre...

00:09.610 --> 00:11.079
promise me that you'll

00:11.112 --> 00:12.980
destroy that bitch

00:13.013 --> 00:14.382
that killed our baby.

00:14.415 --> 00:17.485
LUCIOUS: Laviticus Las Vegas
is not like any other club.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.553
You and Nessa are out.

00:21.055 --> 00:22.256
You two know each other?

00:22.290 --> 00:24.325
Lucious-- let him go up to Vegas

00:24.358 --> 00:25.426
and set up Inferno.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.328
And then we take it from him.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.429
Your melody with

00:28.462 --> 00:29.597
my arrangement--

00:29.630 --> 00:32.533
that's what's beautiful.

00:32.566 --> 00:35.269
Cookie, sweetheart,
when my family decides to shoot,

00:35.303 --> 00:38.772
your entire family
will burn to the ground.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.874
We have received reports
of child endangerment.

00:40.908 --> 00:42.443
Wait, wait, wait...
(all clamoring)

00:42.476 --> 00:44.212
(all shouting)

00:44.245 --> 00:46.880
Don't make me ask you again.
Give her to me now, sir.

00:46.914 --> 00:48.516
LUCIOUS:
You think I don't know
who's behind this?

00:48.549 --> 00:50.984
It's the Dubois.

00:53.154 --> 00:55.489
("Get Up and Get Down"
by The Dramatics begins)

01:01.329 --> 01:03.097
* Come on

01:03.131 --> 01:05.032
* Get up *

01:05.065 --> 01:07.468
(whooping, vocalizing)

01:07.501 --> 01:09.570
* Get up *
* Come along,
come on and get up *

01:09.603 --> 01:12.106
* Get down

01:12.140 --> 01:14.007
* Get up. *

01:17.145 --> 01:18.679
(man coughs)

01:32.360 --> 01:33.927
My family

01:33.961 --> 01:36.830
and I...
(quietly): Perhaps they
should speak first.

01:36.864 --> 01:37.998
I'm sorry, what?

01:38.031 --> 01:40.601
It might be best

01:40.634 --> 01:42.836
if the Lyon family speaks first.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.505
Okay, lady,
we know you got connections

01:44.538 --> 01:46.274
and I know you got juice.
That's why I know

01:46.307 --> 01:47.508
you had something to do with

01:47.541 --> 01:49.009
my grandbaby getting snatched.

01:49.042 --> 01:51.145
LUCIOUS:
Along with the rest of the B.S.

01:51.179 --> 01:53.347
y'all been peddling
to the rest of these politicians

01:53.381 --> 01:54.782
in this city.
DIANA: Watch your tone

01:54.815 --> 01:57.251
with me, Lucious.
COOKIE:
Bitch, do you want me

01:57.285 --> 01:58.586
to jump across this table?

01:58.619 --> 02:01.189
Because I don't have all day
for this, okay?

02:01.222 --> 02:02.456
You feelin' froggy? Leap.

02:02.490 --> 02:03.757
Okay, well, here I come.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.359
THIRSTY:
No, no, no, it's okay. No, no.

02:05.393 --> 02:07.328
No, it's all right,
it's okay. It's okay!
Uh-uh, no. Let me...

02:07.361 --> 02:08.496
Come on.
You better tell this bitch

02:08.529 --> 02:09.797
who I am.
(clears throat)

02:09.830 --> 02:11.031
(scoffs)

02:11.064 --> 02:12.333
THIRSTY:
What Ms. Lyon

02:12.366 --> 02:13.601
is trying to
get at is:

02:13.634 --> 02:14.868
this is about a child.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.104
So, it's understandable
that tempers are hot.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.039
Now, the Lyon family
has reason to believe

02:19.072 --> 02:20.140
that the Dubois family

02:20.174 --> 02:21.975
had something to do with
Child Protective Services

02:22.009 --> 02:24.612
coming to their home
and taking the baby, Bella.

02:24.645 --> 02:27.047
A heinous act, that has
the own child's father,

02:27.080 --> 02:29.883
Hakeem Lyon, too distraught
to even be here today.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.985
Now, we demand
that the child be

02:32.019 --> 02:33.020
returned home.

02:33.053 --> 02:33.887
If that can happen,

02:33.921 --> 02:35.889
everything will be
right as rain.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.491
Our family had nothing to do
with whatever happened

02:37.525 --> 02:38.859
to your baby.

02:38.892 --> 02:39.993
JAMAL: Angelo, you took
$5 million-- I'm sorry,

02:40.027 --> 02:44.131
your family
took $5 million from mine.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.133
So what is all this, are you--
you want to humble us,

02:46.166 --> 02:47.968
you want us
to bow down?

02:48.001 --> 02:49.903
That's why y'all going so low?
Us?

02:49.937 --> 02:51.305
My cousin, Angelo,
lost his career

02:51.339 --> 02:53.474
because of you.
If you think that-- what?
Okay, okay.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.409
Ezekiel,
Snoop's banker.

02:55.443 --> 02:57.177
LANA: Dubois have been
governors, senators,

02:57.211 --> 02:58.145
cabinet members.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.513
Angelo was destined
for even greater...

02:59.547 --> 03:01.749
Congratulations. What you're not
gonna do is compare politics

03:01.782 --> 03:03.851
to a baby being taken
out of her mother's arms.

03:03.884 --> 03:06.053
LANA: Please don't
start with this.

03:06.086 --> 03:07.555
Politics...
JAMAL:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:07.588 --> 03:08.422
Let's do it, let's do it.

03:08.456 --> 03:12.726
(overlapping arguing)

03:12.760 --> 03:14.061
...as everyone thinks

03:14.094 --> 03:15.529
your family is!

03:15.563 --> 03:17.665
ANIKA: Please!
Please, everyone?

03:17.698 --> 03:20.033
Please just
shut up!

03:20.067 --> 03:22.770
I do not care
who did what to whom!

03:22.803 --> 03:25.873
I just want
my daughter back.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.808
Please.

03:31.144 --> 03:35.449
Please, just help me
find my child.

03:35.483 --> 03:38.486
(softly):
Please.

03:42.590 --> 03:45.759
I am so sorry.

03:45.793 --> 03:49.697
I think it's terrible that
your child was taken.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.964
Please. (scoffs)

03:50.998 --> 03:52.966
You are so much better
than the company you keep.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.269
And yes, we have
connections.

03:55.303 --> 03:56.470
Yeah, I know.

03:56.504 --> 03:57.638
Connections born
from generations

03:57.671 --> 03:59.106
of serving our community--

03:59.139 --> 04:01.041
a community which
you have chosen

04:01.074 --> 04:02.543
to represent very
differently, I might add.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.944
(Cookie clicks tongue)

04:03.977 --> 04:05.279
All right,
all right, all right.

04:05.313 --> 04:08.248
Look, look, I-I see
where all this is going.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.951
All right, so y'all
got a little power in you.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.554
You know how to play
a little hit back.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.323
And y'all fancy.

04:15.356 --> 04:17.391
But when we hit,

04:17.425 --> 04:19.026
we hit real hard.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.669
I have no idea
what happened to your child.

04:30.804 --> 04:34.542
So, y'all really want to
go down that road?

04:36.276 --> 04:37.978
(chuckles)

04:55.363 --> 05:00.368
*

05:03.371 --> 05:05.205
It's been 30 minutes.

05:05.238 --> 05:06.774
THIRSTY: Everything's working
out as promised, okay?

05:06.807 --> 05:07.808
It's gonna work out.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.711
Oh, my God.
Oh, my poor baby.

05:10.744 --> 05:13.547
Paying for all the terrible
things that I've done.

05:13.581 --> 05:14.882
Don't be so hard on yourself.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.717
Thirsty said he
gonna get her back.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.218
So, I've talked to my supervisor

05:18.251 --> 05:20.954
and asked him to cross-reference
the name in the database, so...

05:20.988 --> 05:22.022
Why? Did something happen?

05:22.055 --> 05:22.956
No. No, no, no.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.057
I'm sure she's fine.
Wait, wait.

05:24.091 --> 05:25.393
What do you mean,
"I'm sure"?

05:25.426 --> 05:26.627
W-What she means is,

05:26.660 --> 05:28.128
we can't seem to
find your daughter.

05:28.161 --> 05:28.996
What?

05:29.029 --> 05:29.830
Can't or won't?

05:29.863 --> 05:31.231
I understand
this is confusing.

05:31.264 --> 05:33.166
If you would please just come
into my office...

05:33.200 --> 05:36.404
I was told that the child would
be released to her mother today.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.472
I understand that and I'm sorry.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.574
This is very odd.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.075
Several motions
have been filed,

05:42.109 --> 05:43.977
but I can't
tell by who.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.078
Any one of
these motions

05:45.112 --> 05:48.015
would take at least a month
to untangle.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.417
Well, you better untangle it.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.485
From what I
can see here,

05:51.519 --> 05:54.221
you're not gonna see that
child for quite some time.

05:54.254 --> 05:56.590
Oh, no, no, no. No. No.

05:56.624 --> 05:58.325
Last name Lyon,
first name Bella.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.693
That's exactly who's file...
THIRSTY: Are we talking

05:59.727 --> 06:01.261
time or money?
HAKEEM: Last name Lyon,

06:01.294 --> 06:02.362
first name Bella!

06:02.396 --> 06:04.732
I want my daughter, man!

06:04.765 --> 06:07.334
LUCIOUS: They must be
out of their damn minds,

06:07.367 --> 06:09.403
they think I'm just gonna
stand still for this.

06:09.437 --> 06:10.771
So, what you gonna do,

06:10.804 --> 06:13.574
go in Child Protective
Services guns a-blazing?

06:13.607 --> 06:16.577
(sighs)
Dubois' is a type of power

06:16.610 --> 06:18.245
we ain't never seen before.

06:18.278 --> 06:21.782
No, we are a monster they've
never imagined dealing with.

06:21.815 --> 06:24.685
Well, they certainly
are strong, and...

06:24.718 --> 06:26.420
they stick together,
that's for sure.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.725
Seeing how tight they are
just reminds me

06:31.759 --> 06:35.529
of how weak
we are when we're divided.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.765
And we got to do better.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.633
We got to do better, Lucious.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.135
(doorbell rings)
(sighs)

06:42.169 --> 06:43.871
Let's clean this up,
'cause if that's Hakeem,

06:43.904 --> 06:46.574
and he sees this stuff,
he's gonna spin out.

06:46.607 --> 06:47.941
(bell jingles)

06:47.975 --> 06:52.245
Can you take this to
the room, please? That.

06:58.652 --> 07:01.088
You were right.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.591
I should have never let them
take the baby.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.694
(sighs)

07:09.597 --> 07:10.998
Okay, um...

07:11.031 --> 07:12.933
Lucious, it
doesn't make sense

07:12.966 --> 07:14.802
that a baby could
completely disappear.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.303
I don't know.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.305
I mean, it's got
to be the Dubois.

07:18.338 --> 07:19.807
That's why they can't
get away with this.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.475
Well, you know what?
They can and they did.

07:21.509 --> 07:22.510
All right, apparently

07:22.543 --> 07:25.479
we underestimated how
powerful this family is.

07:25.513 --> 07:26.514
So what do we do?

07:26.547 --> 07:27.848
HAKEEM:
Well,

07:27.881 --> 07:29.517
just think about Bella
being alone in some...

07:29.550 --> 07:30.984
some foster home.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.385
Where's my daughter, Mom?

07:34.955 --> 07:36.590
Where's she at?!

07:36.624 --> 07:38.125
I don't know.

07:39.660 --> 07:42.195
Bad news is, is that we're gonna
have to, uh, distance

07:42.229 --> 07:43.997
most of the Lyon
family from the child.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.198
Okay,
then why is that?

07:45.232 --> 07:47.535
Because on paper,
all of you are unfit.

07:47.568 --> 07:48.502
LEAH:
I knew it,

07:48.536 --> 07:49.603
I knew it,
I knew it.

07:49.637 --> 07:50.804
Please.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.506
HAKEEM:
This whole situation...

07:52.540 --> 07:54.374
it's sick.

07:54.407 --> 07:55.843
This whole family...

07:56.977 --> 07:58.078
...is sick.

07:59.580 --> 08:02.315
Hey, Anika,
y-you two are still married,

08:02.349 --> 08:03.817
but if we can
expedite the divorce,

08:03.851 --> 08:05.285
it would show
in good faith

08:05.318 --> 08:07.387
that you're making an asserted
effort to distance yourself

08:07.420 --> 08:09.222
from the family
and that will benefit us.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.696
Just, Thirsty, make it happen.

08:15.729 --> 08:18.899
Okay. I'm on it.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.233
(Thirsty clears throat)

08:20.267 --> 08:21.902
LUCIOUS: Listen,
for the rest of us,

08:21.935 --> 08:23.537
question is:
what kind of a family

08:23.571 --> 08:24.972
is Bella coming
back to?

08:25.005 --> 08:29.509
So, I need everybody to
keep their lives on track,

08:29.543 --> 08:31.912
so that she's coming back
to a strong family.

08:33.914 --> 08:36.750
We got to get our minds right.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.986
JAMAL:
Dad's right.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.854
We need to acknowledge the fact

08:40.888 --> 08:42.255
that we're all here together,
for Bella.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.224
So, we know how
to come together.

08:44.257 --> 08:45.358
Yeah.

08:45.392 --> 08:47.260
Which means we're more fit
than anybody.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.830
COOKIE: We're gonna
get my grandbaby back.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.899
One way or another.

09:00.641 --> 09:03.043
* Oh, free, free,
free, free, free *

09:03.076 --> 09:04.544
* Free, free

09:04.578 --> 09:06.179
* Hey

09:06.213 --> 09:08.916
* Free, free, free, free

09:08.949 --> 09:10.584
* Free, free, oh

09:10.618 --> 09:11.785
* I feel it in my soul

09:11.819 --> 09:15.388
* I know I'm ready for it

09:15.422 --> 09:18.358
* And now he's stronger
than before *

09:18.391 --> 09:22.095
* Ready to rule my world

09:22.129 --> 09:24.798
* The only thing
that could break the seal *

09:24.832 --> 09:27.300
* That opens my heart

09:27.334 --> 09:29.703
* That once was so hard

09:29.737 --> 09:32.039
* But now, but now

09:32.072 --> 09:34.875
* We bow down at his feet

09:34.908 --> 09:36.476
* The crown is his alone

09:36.509 --> 09:39.046
* I'm looking at my king

09:39.079 --> 09:42.315
* Take back his throne *

09:42.349 --> 09:45.152
* And he's returned
for you and me *

09:45.185 --> 09:47.921
* We won't ever be alone

09:47.955 --> 09:49.990
* I'm looking at my king

09:50.023 --> 09:52.893
* Take back his throne *

09:52.926 --> 09:55.663
* Whoa

09:55.696 --> 09:58.732
* Take back his throne *

09:58.766 --> 09:59.767
* Free, free, free

09:59.800 --> 10:01.669
LUCIOUS:
Kill it, kill it.

10:01.702 --> 10:02.836
* Free, free, oh.

10:02.870 --> 10:06.406
Look, ladies,
I'm-a tell you the truth,

10:06.439 --> 10:08.175
I love everything
that y'all are doing.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.678
I mean, it's a beautiful show.
It really is.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.780
Problem is: it's the wrong show.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.114
They've got so much
Cirque in there,

10:14.147 --> 10:15.348
that they're missing
the Soleil.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.984
They're missing the soul
of the this whole thing.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.986
I need it to be...

10:19.019 --> 10:21.521
this, with more of a hip-hop,

10:21.554 --> 10:23.290
urban, contemporary
kind of thing,

10:23.323 --> 10:24.424
you know what I'm saying?
Yes.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.026
Can y'all
give me that?
WOMAN: Yeah.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.762
Thank you.
Come on, ladies.

10:28.796 --> 10:30.163
Why is everybody leaving?

10:30.197 --> 10:31.932
I-I'm looking to see the whole

10:31.965 --> 10:33.433
Inferno extravaganza.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.502
You'll see
the Infer extravaganza

10:35.535 --> 10:37.705
when either you become
a part of the show

10:37.738 --> 10:39.372
or you pay like everybody else.

10:39.406 --> 10:42.042
Yeah, well, one step at a time,
not five, big homie.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.476
Um, anyway,

10:43.510 --> 10:46.847
look, I... I listened
to the first mix of the song.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.381
And?

10:49.482 --> 10:50.617
It's fire.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.219
Boom.
Whatever.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.722
JAMAL (laughing):
It's fire.
That's what I'm talking about.

10:54.755 --> 10:55.956
That's what I'm
talking about!
It is.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.057
I knew you was gonna love it.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.391
You know what I was thinking,
though?
Hmm?

10:58.425 --> 11:01.862
Why are we doing the same song
on two separate albums?

11:01.895 --> 11:03.496
It's kind of
superfluous, right?

11:03.530 --> 11:05.532
You know, so I think
I want to remix mine.

11:05.565 --> 11:08.168
Nah, man, I don't know about
you remixing the song.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.337
Yeah, 'cause
it's dope, right?
Yeah, it is.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.139
It is. But, look,
if you're gonna remix it,

11:12.172 --> 11:13.573
if that's what we're
really talking about, you know,

11:13.606 --> 11:15.542
I-I still have to be...
Of course, of course.

11:15.575 --> 11:18.011
But what I'm gonna do
is have a young emcee

11:18.045 --> 11:20.080
that's representing
me on this thing.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.715
Nah, nah, see, slow down.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.350
There's no emcee on the song.

11:23.383 --> 11:25.919
There's just not.
There's... send me the stems.

11:25.953 --> 11:27.587
Why? So you can soft-pedal
the thing?

11:27.620 --> 11:29.556
No. No, trust me.
What I'm gonna do,

11:29.589 --> 11:32.259
I'm gonna set up a session
for you to meet this cat.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.827
When I say he's incredible,

11:33.861 --> 11:35.562
I'm talking about incredible.

11:35.595 --> 11:38.966
Why you look all
despondent now?

11:40.868 --> 11:42.369
(chuckles)

11:42.402 --> 11:45.272
I'm trippin', all right?
Set it up.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.274
Listen, don't call
my stuff soft.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.777
COOKIE:
This album

11:49.810 --> 11:51.211
is a masterpiece.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.080
And this
is not gonna get Lucious

11:53.113 --> 11:54.547
to where I need him to be.

11:54.581 --> 11:55.415
You don't know that.

11:55.448 --> 11:56.383
Yes, I do.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.585
Lucious is not sweatin' it,

11:58.618 --> 12:00.587
and this Vegas deal
is worth billions.

12:00.620 --> 12:03.023
Hey, Ma.
Hey.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.225
So I gave him the basics
of your plan, but, uh,

12:05.258 --> 12:07.460
we both have concerns
about that tight window.
(chuckles)

12:07.494 --> 12:10.297
Baby, I done climbed through
many a tight windows in my day.

12:10.330 --> 12:14.067
Speaking of which, uh, are
we doing what we talked about,

12:14.101 --> 12:15.602
about getting
my grandbaby back?

12:15.635 --> 12:18.138
Yeah, it's in the works.
But, uh...

12:18.171 --> 12:20.473
let's talk
about this Vegas thing.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.943
Look, we all know
it's Vegas or bust, right?

12:22.976 --> 12:25.145
So what we got to do
is turn this album

12:25.178 --> 12:26.914
into a Vegas production.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.748
What about Inferno?

12:28.782 --> 12:31.318
Oh, child,
they already fallin' behind.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.120
You know,
Lucious as bad as Dr. Dre

12:33.153 --> 12:34.822
when it comes to trying
to be a perfectionist.

12:34.855 --> 12:38.725
Look, they don't have a story
line. It's not coming together.

12:38.758 --> 12:42.329
Unlike When Cookie Met Lucious.
We got a built-in story line.

12:42.362 --> 12:45.165
Shine, you need
to get us in to see Marcone.
Yes.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.000
What does that do for me?

12:47.034 --> 12:49.937
We secure our place,
or we'll all be out.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.404
How do you not understand that?

12:51.438 --> 12:54.507
I understand you need
to drop your tone, Andre.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.009
All right, look,
look, look, look,

12:56.043 --> 12:57.577
if we switch out

12:57.610 --> 13:00.613
Inferno for our show,
I promise you, Shine,

13:00.647 --> 13:02.782
I got you. I keep
telling you that.

13:02.816 --> 13:04.852
And I'll make Lucious crawl.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.320
(sighs) Boy, this is not
about punishing your daddy,

13:07.354 --> 13:09.522
this is about family,
and that woman

13:09.556 --> 13:12.359
got your daddy twisted and that
ain't good for none of us.

13:12.392 --> 13:13.994
Well, my last name's not Lyon.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.329
(sighs)

13:16.363 --> 13:20.633
Will you, for once,
take your mind out of the gutter

13:20.667 --> 13:21.668
and think big?

13:21.701 --> 13:24.004
Can you do that?
Can you think big, Shine?

13:24.037 --> 13:25.272
(chuckles)

13:25.305 --> 13:26.539
(mocking laugh)
Can you?
Andre.

13:26.573 --> 13:27.841
Andre.

13:29.709 --> 13:30.844
Do me a favor,

13:30.878 --> 13:33.646
call me after you sing
the lullaby for this J Cat.

13:33.680 --> 13:34.948
We'll work out
the details later.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.217
Yes.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.255
I'm gonna need you to calm down.

13:43.756 --> 13:46.326
Get proactive
and call your doctor, boy.

13:50.430 --> 13:51.831
PORSHA:
Hey, Andre, you know,

13:51.865 --> 13:53.000
I know a good doctor.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.334
COOKIE:
Shut up, Porsha!

13:54.367 --> 13:55.735
Mind your business.

13:58.771 --> 14:00.640
* Yeah, shining bright
like the morning *

14:00.673 --> 14:02.242
* It won't be long
for the glory... *

14:02.275 --> 14:03.743
JAMAL: All right,
I'm here.

14:03.776 --> 14:05.078
About damn time.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.579
What's up, Tyree?
TYREE:
What up, J?

14:06.613 --> 14:08.916
LUCIOUS:
Yeah, I got Tyree here so we can

14:08.949 --> 14:10.750
try and recapture some
of that magic you had

14:10.783 --> 14:12.019
on that first one.

14:12.052 --> 14:15.655
Well, I mean magic, it sounds
like you just sped up the track.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.723
It does.

14:16.756 --> 14:18.591
All right, so where's this emcee
you want me to meet?

14:18.625 --> 14:22.595
Hey, Ty, will you turn that off,
man? For a minute?

14:22.629 --> 14:25.565
* No one planned...
I mean, he, he...
he got held up.

14:25.598 --> 14:28.268
Just getting out,
so he's gonna be a minute.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.270
What you mean,
"just getting out"?

14:30.303 --> 14:32.839
We waiting for an artist
'cause he got locked up?

14:32.872 --> 14:33.941
He's not coming from jail.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.276
Allegedly,

14:36.309 --> 14:37.945
someone shot him
four times yesterday.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.112
Oh, my Lord,
the plot thickens.

14:39.146 --> 14:40.613
Y'all got to be joking.

14:40.647 --> 14:43.250
How are we supposed to have
a rapper that just got shot?

14:43.283 --> 14:44.217
Allegedly.

14:44.251 --> 14:45.452
(chuckling)

14:45.485 --> 14:47.254
Ain't no one confirm it.
(door opens)

14:47.287 --> 14:48.388
Look who the cat drug in.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.722
Yo, what up, man?

14:49.756 --> 14:51.124
What's up, brother?
You all right?
(Lucious laughs)

14:51.158 --> 14:52.292
Yeah, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:52.325 --> 14:53.593
Too many stitches for
the hugs right now, man.

14:53.626 --> 14:54.962
You know what I'm saying?
I hear you, man.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.197
Hey, you got the
pills on you?

14:57.230 --> 14:58.631
Man, you better be careful,
they're gonna start calling you

14:58.665 --> 15:02.369
the Grim Reaper.
Here you go, fam.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.737
LUCIOUS: Man, you
should keep that limp,

15:04.771 --> 15:06.039
it's kind of slick.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.307
Thanks for
showing up, baby.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.242
TRIG: You know
I got you, man.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.478
Dad, come on, man.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.546
This dude can barely stand up,
let alone perform.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.648
LUCIOUS: Will you give that
brother a chance, please?

15:15.682 --> 15:17.584
JAMAL: Yeah, well, he should be
in a hospital right now.

15:17.617 --> 15:18.986
If he's supposed to
be in the hospital,

15:19.019 --> 15:20.253
he'd be in
the hospital.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.722
He's supposed to be right
here in this moment.

15:22.755 --> 15:26.493
I ain't even want
the rapper on the song.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.761
Tyree, will you school
this young Lyon cub

15:28.795 --> 15:29.963
for me, please?

15:29.997 --> 15:31.431
Shut this
brother up?

15:31.464 --> 15:32.832
TRIG:
* Yo, hey

15:32.865 --> 15:34.567
* Young black brother
from the struggle *

15:34.601 --> 15:36.736
* Mama said I'm prayed up,
they can't touch you *

15:36.769 --> 15:39.439
* Only when you heaven high
is when they all love you *

15:39.472 --> 15:41.341
* Looking and
you smelling fine *

15:41.374 --> 15:42.775
* When they all hug you

15:42.809 --> 15:44.577
* But, baby, I'm a king, hey,
Mike Jordan *

15:44.611 --> 15:45.612
* Fist full of rings, yeah

15:45.645 --> 15:47.347
* Champion ahead of my league

15:47.380 --> 15:48.515
* Yeah, hey

15:48.548 --> 15:50.750
* Huh, I only go to war
for the green *

15:50.783 --> 15:52.652
* Yeah, I only show love
for my team *

15:52.685 --> 15:54.654
* Yeah, you know I got
my kids right *

15:54.687 --> 15:56.990
* Show you how I live right,
we was living wrong *

15:57.024 --> 15:59.359
* And now we all live right,
coming were I'm come from *

15:59.392 --> 16:00.793
* I'm just trying to live life

16:00.827 --> 16:03.030
* Trying to stick around, hey
You see that?

16:03.063 --> 16:04.831
* Make it through my kid's life,
feel like I was chose, son... *

16:04.864 --> 16:06.933
See, this is his moment.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.868
He's willing to die for
this moment, right now.

16:08.901 --> 16:12.472
* First they wasn't on it
and now I got them on some *

16:14.241 --> 16:15.842
* We were wrong

16:15.875 --> 16:17.377
* And now we all live right

16:17.410 --> 16:18.478
* Coming where I'm from

16:18.511 --> 16:19.812
* And I'm just trying to
live life *

16:19.846 --> 16:21.481
* Trying to stick around and

16:21.514 --> 16:23.983
* Make it through my
kids life, yeah. *

16:26.986 --> 16:28.221
All right.

16:28.255 --> 16:29.356
The emcee is dope.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.391
But your track
still ain't right.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.492
No, no, no, you're
just saying that

16:32.525 --> 16:34.161
because, what? It's too hard?

16:34.194 --> 16:36.829
But you see that young man
in there, bleeding?

16:36.863 --> 16:38.565
He's doing that 'cause
that's what it takes.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.733
He's got heart, man.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.502
He got shot four times
and where is he?

16:42.535 --> 16:43.970
He's right in
the studio.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.506
You got shot once. What
did you do? You disappeared.

16:48.275 --> 16:51.144
No, no, Mal, I'm not even saying
this as any kind of a diss.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.546
What I'm saying is I understand
this music in a way

16:53.580 --> 16:54.847
that you don't get yet.

16:54.881 --> 16:56.916
Yeah, all right.

16:56.949 --> 16:59.686
Yo, how many of y'all
been shot before?

17:06.293 --> 17:08.928
But you haven't.

17:08.961 --> 17:11.198
Dad, nobody told you how to deal
with your father getting shot,

17:11.231 --> 17:14.401
so don't tell me how to deal
with taking a bullet for mine.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.770
And I'm sorry, but you play it
hard and-and being hard-headed

17:17.804 --> 17:19.972
and doing it your way,
that's why Bella was taken.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.744
Now, I want to work with you,
but I ain't backing down.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.446
You need to listen
to my version,

17:26.479 --> 17:28.181
you need to listen
to my version now.

17:28.215 --> 17:29.949
Tyree,
please take this

17:29.982 --> 17:32.785
and school this old Lyon.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.393
*

17:40.427 --> 17:42.462
WOMAN:
* Oh

17:42.495 --> 17:45.798
* Hey, hey, hey, hey *

17:45.832 --> 17:49.202
* Hey, hey,
hey, hey *

17:49.236 --> 17:52.605
* Oh, oh
* Hey, hey, hey, hey *

17:52.639 --> 17:55.808
* Hey, hey, hey, hey *

17:55.842 --> 17:57.076
* Oh
* Hey...

17:57.110 --> 17:59.146
TYREE:
Oh, my God.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.980
Lucious, he killed it.

18:01.013 --> 18:02.649
He killed it.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.551
* Hey, hey *

18:04.584 --> 18:06.953
* Hey, hey, hey *

18:06.986 --> 18:09.256
Did he?

18:09.289 --> 18:11.458
* Hey, hey, hey. *

18:15.695 --> 18:17.630
(sighs)

18:18.998 --> 18:20.367
I don't know if, um...

18:26.473 --> 18:27.840
Andre.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.676
I-I thought
you were Lucious.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.583
We have unfinished business.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.186
I don't know what
you're talking about.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.520
You know what I'm talking about.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.489
About the murder
of my child.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.524
Rhonda told me you pushed
her down the stairs.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.593
No, no-- Oh! Oh,
my God! I'm s...!

18:46.626 --> 18:48.161
ANDRE:
Don't lie to me!

18:48.195 --> 18:49.329
(Anika yells)
Shut up!

18:49.362 --> 18:50.397
(Anika crying)

18:50.430 --> 18:52.098
You think I'm gonna let
you get away with that?

18:52.131 --> 18:53.433
You think you can kill
my wife and kill my kid

18:53.466 --> 18:55.168
and get away with that?
That what you think?!
No!

18:55.202 --> 18:57.036
I'm gonna make you pay, bitch!

18:57.069 --> 18:58.471
Do it!

18:58.505 --> 19:00.173
Do it, I deserve it!

19:00.207 --> 19:02.041
What?! Why?!
(yells)

19:02.074 --> 19:03.810
What?! What?!

19:03.843 --> 19:04.744
I'm sorry!

19:06.346 --> 19:09.449
I wanted so badly to be a Lyon.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.284
I sold my soul,

19:11.318 --> 19:16.656
and now... now my... my baby.

19:17.724 --> 19:21.194
I deserve to suffer!

19:21.228 --> 19:23.696
Do it.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.298
Do it.
No.

19:25.332 --> 19:29.068
Suffer.
(whimpering)

19:29.101 --> 19:30.370
Like I do.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.738
(sobbing)

19:36.276 --> 19:37.610
Suffer.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.021
(door slams)

19:49.055 --> 19:50.990
(loud sobbing)

19:51.023 --> 19:54.594
* She lick it up
just like a candy *

19:54.627 --> 19:57.597
* She wanna make 'em
leave they family *

19:57.630 --> 19:59.332
* She tryin' to live a life

19:59.366 --> 20:01.668
* So fancy

20:01.701 --> 20:04.203
* She wanna pull up
in a Bentley *

20:04.237 --> 20:05.204
Keem.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.940
* She ain't got time
for lovin'... *

20:07.974 --> 20:10.243
You got me feeling nervous, man.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.779
I mean, I ain't really
never seen you this beat.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.181
I got to do something.

20:15.214 --> 20:16.283
I feel like I should.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.750
Yeah, you're right, you should.

20:17.784 --> 20:21.120
HAKEEM (over speakers):
* It's been a while,
but we finally on *

20:21.153 --> 20:22.622
Yo, kill it.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.223
Nah, keep my music on.

20:24.257 --> 20:26.626
Matter of fact, hey, shorty,

20:26.659 --> 20:29.128
you, you, you,
get the hell out of here!

20:29.161 --> 20:31.431
Now, I know Cookie told y'all
to watch me,

20:31.464 --> 20:32.965
but y'all got to
get to steppin'.

20:32.999 --> 20:33.966
Get to steppin'!

20:34.000 --> 20:36.303
* Hey, I leveled up,
had to put my city on *

20:36.336 --> 20:38.405
* Yeah, they thought that
I was done *

20:38.438 --> 20:40.473
No offense, y-you, too.

20:40.507 --> 20:41.641
* They just levitated

20:41.674 --> 20:43.142
* Levitated *

20:43.175 --> 20:44.744
I need to be alone.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.579
* I got the keys, yeah,
I got the keys *

20:46.613 --> 20:47.947
Catch.

20:47.980 --> 20:50.650
* Till the death of me

20:50.683 --> 20:53.152
* Elevation.

20:53.185 --> 20:55.855
(music winds to a stop)

21:01.093 --> 21:03.029
*

21:11.103 --> 21:15.174
Uh, can you get Paulie
Walnuts to back up off me?

21:18.378 --> 21:20.613
So why am I meeting with
you behind Lucious' back?

21:20.647 --> 21:23.115
'Cause you're doing a deal
with a man who's lying to you.

21:23.149 --> 21:26.152
What's he talking about?
Uh, Inferno.

21:26.185 --> 21:28.154
Lucious is billing it
as performances

21:28.187 --> 21:30.457
by all of
Empire's artists,

21:30.490 --> 21:31.924
and he doesn't have Jamal Lyon.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.460
Empire's biggest star.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.662
Not to mention,
the show is struggling.

21:35.695 --> 21:38.631
Lucious doesn't like
the script, so...

21:38.665 --> 21:39.766
So what are you offering?

21:39.799 --> 21:41.868
Look, we all know
people come to Vegas

21:41.901 --> 21:43.503
in search of something special.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.037
Well, I want to give it to them.

21:45.071 --> 21:48.541
I have an Empire show
that's better than Inferno.

21:48.575 --> 21:52.879
It's called Jamal Lyon's
When Cookie Met Lucious.

21:52.912 --> 21:55.382
It's a visual album--
you saw Lemonade, right?

21:55.415 --> 21:57.183
(laughs)

21:57.216 --> 22:00.219
And it tells the story
of the first family of hip-hop.

22:00.252 --> 22:02.722
Performed and produced
by all of the Lyons.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.056
You're gonna get me
Jamal and Lucious?

22:04.090 --> 22:05.558
Yes, I...

22:05.592 --> 22:06.626
No, no. Lucious
isn't gonna be...

22:06.659 --> 22:07.860
Uh, yes.

22:07.894 --> 22:08.895
Yes.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.663
You see the chitter-chatter
on twitterverse.

22:10.697 --> 22:12.699
They can't keep Coocious
out of their mouths.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.066
They want to know
our love story.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.902
They want to know how
we built that Empire.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.036
That could be huge.

22:17.069 --> 22:18.371
(whispers):
Lot of money.

22:18.405 --> 22:19.672
But Lucious
isn't here.

22:19.706 --> 22:21.073
So how do I know he's on board?

22:21.107 --> 22:23.976
I promise you:
Lucious is a businessman

22:24.010 --> 22:25.745
and an artist. He's
gonna love this.

22:25.778 --> 22:26.746
Who wouldn't?

22:26.779 --> 22:27.847
Who doesn't like making money?

22:27.880 --> 22:29.749
It's Vegas, baby.
(laughs)

22:29.782 --> 22:31.851
You get me Lucious, and I'm in.

22:31.884 --> 22:34.353
Lucious is a liar and a snake.

22:34.387 --> 22:36.088
Mm-mm, mm-mm.
I won't work with him. Mm-hmm.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.224
How about that? Hey, man.
Sit down!
Hey! Hey!

22:38.257 --> 22:39.426
Hands off me, man.
Get your hands off my son!

22:39.459 --> 22:40.893
Call them off.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.762
Get off my son.

22:42.795 --> 22:43.763
That's enough. That's enough.

22:43.796 --> 22:46.032
Yeah, that's enough. Back up.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.435
Uh, Andre.

22:48.468 --> 22:49.569
Out the way.

22:49.602 --> 22:51.170
*

22:51.203 --> 22:52.605
Pazzo.

22:52.639 --> 22:54.774
*

22:54.807 --> 22:56.409
* Do-do-do-do, do-do

22:56.443 --> 23:00.279
* Do-do-do-do-do.

23:00.312 --> 23:02.515
I'm telling y'all,
the Dubois family

23:02.549 --> 23:05.452
used my family's struggles
into tricking the system

23:05.485 --> 23:07.119
and taking my baby.

23:07.153 --> 23:09.055
And at first,
I was mad at my mom and my pops,

23:09.088 --> 23:10.790
because I actually believed it.

23:10.823 --> 23:13.860
All we want is Bella back.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.995
I want her back!

23:17.997 --> 23:20.232
* I was born
with the fire in me *

23:20.266 --> 23:22.469
* I acknowledge the struggle,
that's the Lyon in me *

23:22.502 --> 23:25.404
* They say we failed the system,
but they fail to realize *

23:25.438 --> 23:28.808
* I'm speaking all facts,
they telling real lies *

23:28.841 --> 23:30.543
* Everything I did
was for Bella *

23:30.577 --> 23:32.311
* How they gonna stop me

23:32.344 --> 23:35.314
* I'm fighting like I'm Rocky,
they hate that I'm cocky *

23:35.347 --> 23:38.551
* They talk down about my
family, but we still rise up *

23:38.585 --> 23:41.821
* It's corruption in the system,
I'm-a open eyes up *

23:41.854 --> 23:44.824
* Hurting inside but they don't
feel my pain, that's in vain *

23:44.857 --> 23:49.095
* 'Cause my skin color dark
as the clouds, I make it rain *

23:49.128 --> 23:52.164
* How they gonna take
my daughter from me? *

23:52.198 --> 23:54.166
* She got Lyon in her veins

23:54.200 --> 23:57.436
* Government be treating blacks
and animals all the same *

23:59.338 --> 24:01.741
* Trying to find out
where to start *

24:01.774 --> 24:03.510
* How to take your boy apart

24:03.543 --> 24:05.011
* I salute my mom and pops

24:05.044 --> 24:08.515
* 'Cause that's
where I got the heart *

24:08.548 --> 24:12.985
* And if I shed a tear,
I hope they feel me *

24:13.019 --> 24:15.087
* I ride for who I really love

24:15.121 --> 24:17.389
* I just gave y'all
the real me. *

24:20.226 --> 24:23.530
The Dubois family is ready
to put this standoff behind us.

24:23.563 --> 24:24.864
Which is why we're recommending

24:24.897 --> 24:27.534
libel sanctions
against Hakeem Lyon.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.035
We should let it blow over.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.369
The boy is understandably upset,

24:30.402 --> 24:31.938
but we didn't have
anything to do

24:31.971 --> 24:34.874
with CPS taking that baby away
from the family.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.876
What... Right, Mother?

24:39.178 --> 24:41.180
(laughs)

24:41.213 --> 24:43.783
(sighing):
Oh, the Lyon family.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.985
Such a disgrace.

24:46.018 --> 24:48.154
A setback for the entire race,

24:48.187 --> 24:53.492
with their degrading lyrics
and thuggish behavior.

24:53.526 --> 24:55.294
I won't lie to you,

24:55.327 --> 24:58.565
I had nothing to do with
that baby being taken.

24:58.598 --> 25:02.034
But I can't say that I feel
an ounce of sympathy for them.

25:02.068 --> 25:04.070
Okay, but we can agree
that we cannot let this escalate

25:04.103 --> 25:06.573
into a full-on
Hatfields and McCoys situation,

25:06.606 --> 25:07.807
right?
Well, of cour...

25:07.840 --> 25:09.809
(crowd shouting)

25:09.842 --> 25:11.678
...course not.

25:11.711 --> 25:14.246
CROWD:
Free Bella!

25:14.280 --> 25:16.048
Yeah, free Bella! Free Bella!

25:16.082 --> 25:18.885
Free Bella!
Uh-huh!

25:18.918 --> 25:20.587
You need to free Bella,
you dirty Dubois.

25:20.620 --> 25:21.654
What's this?

25:21.688 --> 25:24.190
WOMAN: Really?
You steal a baby?

25:24.223 --> 25:25.491
You are despicable.
Free Bella!

25:25.524 --> 25:26.525
Team Keem!

25:26.559 --> 25:28.260
Free Bella!
Yeah, free Bella!

25:28.294 --> 25:31.030
What'd you say about
the Hatfields and the McCoys?

25:31.063 --> 25:34.233
Free Bella! Free Bella!
Free Bella! Free Bella!

25:52.819 --> 25:56.022
Ma.

25:56.055 --> 25:59.759
What are you doing?

25:59.792 --> 26:01.928
What are you doing?

26:08.735 --> 26:11.403
I guess, thinking.

26:11.437 --> 26:13.339
So strange.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.977
Never thought
I would feel this helpless.

26:18.010 --> 26:20.112
If I had known this was
gonna happen, I swear,

26:20.146 --> 26:22.448
I'd have done things
differently.

26:22.481 --> 26:23.482
You know?

26:27.954 --> 26:30.823
It can't all be my fault.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.992
Know that much.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.196
(sighs)

26:40.499 --> 26:42.434
H-Hey, Ma.

26:44.370 --> 26:47.674
Do you think I'm a good father?

26:47.707 --> 26:50.877
You're not even a good person.

26:56.716 --> 26:59.551
True.

27:12.064 --> 27:15.201
* We poppin', we just wanna
rock wit' the hip-hop... *

27:15.234 --> 27:17.469
Boy, what the hell
is wrong with you?

27:17.503 --> 27:19.138
Acting a fool
in that damn meeting,

27:19.171 --> 27:20.372
like you two nickels
short of a dime.

27:20.406 --> 27:23.009
Told you I'm not doing
that deal with Lucious.

27:23.042 --> 27:26.178
There wouldn't be a deal if
I didn't save it with Marcone.

27:26.212 --> 27:27.213
I told him you lost your mind
for a minute,

27:27.246 --> 27:28.314
but you're
fully on board.

27:28.347 --> 27:29.716
Yeah, well,
then you told him a lie.

27:29.749 --> 27:32.384
* Hold that thought,
I'm a little distracted... *

27:32.418 --> 27:35.121
(grunts)

27:35.154 --> 27:37.556
Yeah, yeah, boy.
Fix your tone.

27:37.589 --> 27:39.558
You say you're looking
out for us.
Mm-hmm.

27:39.591 --> 27:41.327
You always end up
protecting Lucious.

27:41.360 --> 27:44.563
No matter what
it costs the rest of us.

27:44.596 --> 27:45.865
We had a deal
without him.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.566
This family needs him.

27:47.599 --> 27:49.836
When Cookie Met Lucious
needs him, stupid.

27:49.869 --> 27:52.338
Yeah, yeah. Why the hell didn't
you say something before we got

27:52.371 --> 27:54.240
in front of Marcone?
I'll tell you why.

27:54.273 --> 27:56.408
Deep down,
in your soul,

27:56.442 --> 27:58.544
you are ashamed of how much
you cater to that man,

27:58.577 --> 28:00.546
and you should be.
You should be, Ma.

28:00.579 --> 28:01.914
(laughs softly)

28:01.948 --> 28:03.750
Look, if we include Lucious

28:03.783 --> 28:06.886
on the deal, we keep him
from going to war, stupid.

28:06.919 --> 28:07.987
You know your daddy.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.421
And we all get
a piece of Vegas.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.090
I don't get a
piece of Vegas.

28:11.123 --> 28:12.759
This new show's got
nothing for me.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.927
Andre.

28:14.961 --> 28:16.362
I think you are forgetting

28:16.395 --> 28:19.365
that Lucious is not
our biggest problem.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.233
It's that bitch, Giuliana.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.736
And you see how
she weaseled her way all up

28:23.770 --> 28:25.604
in our family business.

28:25.637 --> 28:27.774
That skank is trying
to steal all of it.

28:27.807 --> 28:29.675
I don't like Giuliana
either, Ma, okay?

28:29.708 --> 28:30.843
Andre...
No, what?

28:30.877 --> 28:31.911
You were still out of line

28:31.944 --> 28:32.945
for bringing Lucious
in on this deal.

28:32.979 --> 28:34.380
What did you say, little girl?

28:34.413 --> 28:36.115
And Andre is grown, Cookie,

28:36.148 --> 28:37.917
you can't talk to him
like he's a child.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.618
He's not.
(chuckles)

28:39.651 --> 28:44.090
I'm-a need you to understand
what I'm about to do, Andre.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.191
(screams)

28:45.224 --> 28:47.626
Bitch, don't you ever

28:47.659 --> 28:49.728
come in between me and my son.

28:53.665 --> 28:55.134
Andre.

28:55.167 --> 28:58.104
Sweet child of mine.

28:58.137 --> 29:00.807
We do this deal my way,

29:00.840 --> 29:04.710
with the whole family,
or we lose everything.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.078
Do you understand that?!

29:06.112 --> 29:08.815
Damn!

29:08.848 --> 29:10.516
COOKIE: Bitch, next
time, hold your mouth!

29:11.918 --> 29:14.286
(piano playing)

29:29.869 --> 29:31.904
I have something
to show you.

29:31.938 --> 29:34.440
(stops playing)

29:34.473 --> 29:36.575
(exhales)

29:36.608 --> 29:37.676
That's him.

29:37.709 --> 29:39.678
Who?

29:41.047 --> 29:42.281
Your father.

29:45.384 --> 29:48.054
Here, sit down, Mama.

29:51.357 --> 29:53.826
The day he proposed.

29:55.862 --> 29:58.931
If he didn't die, things
might've been better for you.

29:58.965 --> 30:01.433
I would've been a better mama.

30:01.467 --> 30:05.571
Violence made you
what you are, Dwight.

30:07.339 --> 30:08.540
What about this one?

30:08.574 --> 30:10.009
(laughs)

30:10.042 --> 30:12.879
You couldn't tell
Joe he wasn't sharp

30:12.912 --> 30:14.146
as cut glass in those days.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.381
(both chuckle)

30:15.414 --> 30:18.617
Maybe that's who Hakeem
got his style from.

30:18.650 --> 30:19.986
Mm-hmm.

30:20.019 --> 30:23.189
I should've did something
to save him that day.

30:23.222 --> 30:24.323
What are you
talking about?

30:24.356 --> 30:26.825
You were just a boy.

30:26.859 --> 30:29.328
You would've run out
in the middle of that mess

30:29.361 --> 30:31.163
and got killed, too.

30:31.197 --> 30:33.465
Yeah, like...

30:33.499 --> 30:36.568
It's like Jamal, when he
was in the same situation,

30:36.602 --> 30:38.137
you know,
he didn't even hesitate

30:38.170 --> 30:39.738
to jump in front of that bullet.

30:39.771 --> 30:41.908
He just...

30:41.941 --> 30:44.143
Ah, I'll tell you this.

30:44.176 --> 30:49.248
For whatever I can
or did say about you,

30:49.281 --> 30:53.352
that boy, Jamal, is special.

30:53.385 --> 30:56.622
He's got a little
bit of God in him.

31:01.928 --> 31:04.330
You did that, Dwight.

31:04.363 --> 31:09.368
You put that light
into the world.

31:24.116 --> 31:27.486
(inhales, exhales)

31:35.394 --> 31:38.497
(playing piano)

31:51.410 --> 31:52.478
Where you going, big spender?

31:52.511 --> 31:53.980
Hey, Dad.
Just listen, man.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.781
No, I mean, look,
we already discussed this.

31:55.814 --> 31:57.483
It's obvious
that you got a problem

31:57.516 --> 31:59.585
with letting anybody else
take control of the music.

31:59.618 --> 32:00.987
So just go do Inferno,
it'll be dope,

32:01.020 --> 32:02.254
and let me do
When Cookie Met Lucious.

32:02.288 --> 32:04.256
Are you finished?

32:04.290 --> 32:07.293
I heard you, man.

32:08.194 --> 32:10.729
Go on.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.698
Spoiled mother...

32:22.874 --> 32:24.810
(exhales)

32:28.547 --> 32:30.416
Is, is this your...

32:30.449 --> 32:32.684
Yep. My father.

32:32.718 --> 32:35.887
Your grandfather,
Mr. Joe Walker.

32:42.494 --> 32:46.165
(chuckles) You look
a lot like him.

32:46.198 --> 32:47.966
Especially when I was fat.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.301
(laughs)

32:49.335 --> 32:50.602
I figured this might help

32:50.636 --> 32:53.605
with your visual aid...

32:53.639 --> 32:56.208
and, um, help us
make a better album.

32:56.242 --> 32:58.477
What do you mean, us?

32:58.510 --> 33:01.347
Yeah, I relented.

33:01.380 --> 33:04.183
I'm gonna do the
song your way.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.852
Why?

33:06.885 --> 33:09.955
I'm sick and tired
of fighting your ass.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.090
And I realized the truth is

33:11.123 --> 33:13.559
I was fighting against
the natural course of things.

33:13.592 --> 33:17.896
I mean, every son takes over
after his father.

33:17.929 --> 33:22.534
When my daddy died I took
over from him and... point is,

33:22.568 --> 33:25.804
same way my music
was Empire's legacy,

33:25.837 --> 33:28.707
your music will be
Empire's legacy,

33:28.740 --> 33:31.710
and it might as well
start with this song.

33:31.743 --> 33:35.181
Hell, it's time. It is time.

33:35.214 --> 33:37.616
It's time.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.189
* This is our moment

33:43.222 --> 33:45.324
* Ain't no holding us back

33:58.570 --> 34:01.240
* You know I am the one

34:01.273 --> 34:03.275

34:03.309 --> 34:05.611
* The sun appears
to be far away *

34:05.644 --> 34:07.379
* It's been always right here

34:07.413 --> 34:08.780
* Even though
it's in the distance *

34:08.814 --> 34:11.283
* Saw you move the Earth
with your hands *

34:11.317 --> 34:12.851
* Now I know it's getting hard

34:12.884 --> 34:15.121
* I'm first to assist ya

34:15.154 --> 34:17.389
* And when you're old and gray

34:17.423 --> 34:21.026
* Remember I'll
take care of ya *

34:21.059 --> 34:24.130
* Labors of a virtue

34:24.163 --> 34:25.864
* I'll do what I have to

34:25.897 --> 34:29.401
* We gotta let nature take its

34:29.435 --> 34:32.671
* Place

34:34.473 --> 34:36.808
* This is our moment

34:36.842 --> 34:38.310
* Ain't no holding us back

35:09.808 --> 35:11.943
("Love and Happiness"
by Al Green playing)

35:14.713 --> 35:16.682
SHINE: You promised
a piece of the casino.

35:16.715 --> 35:19.017
Yes. Look, Dre
will come around.

35:19.050 --> 35:21.587
We're gonna be running Vegas
by the time this is done,

35:21.620 --> 35:23.355
trust me.
(chuckles)

35:23.389 --> 35:26.525
No, no, no, no, no, Andre.

35:26.558 --> 35:27.959
He can't be here.

35:27.993 --> 35:28.794
He's old enough to know

35:28.827 --> 35:30.196
how things get done
in this family.

35:30.229 --> 35:31.530
Stupid ass. Hi, baby.

35:31.563 --> 35:32.631
Mom, what's going on?

35:32.664 --> 35:34.200
Andre told me we're
getting Bella back.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.201
You okay?

35:35.234 --> 35:36.868
Huh?

35:36.902 --> 35:39.271
Mom, is she gonna be okay?
Yes, she's gonna be fine.

35:39.305 --> 35:41.440
We're gonna get her back. Okay?
You know what? Yes.
You sure?

35:41.473 --> 35:42.874
Just go wait in
the car. Go ahead.

35:42.908 --> 35:44.210
You telling me
you and Shine

35:44.243 --> 35:45.177
are gonna do this?

35:45.211 --> 35:46.612
I'm telling you
we looking forward to it.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.214
Get him out of here.

35:48.247 --> 35:50.716
Stupid ass.

35:50.749 --> 35:53.352
Everything's gonna
be okay, I promise.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.321
* Oh, baby

35:55.354 --> 35:57.389
* Love and happiness...

35:57.423 --> 35:58.390
Ready.

35:58.424 --> 36:00.459
Okay.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.728
* Love and happiness

36:02.761 --> 36:04.162
* Love and happiness *

36:04.196 --> 36:07.065
* Oh, oh.

36:07.098 --> 36:09.735
(grunting)

36:10.236 --> 36:12.170
(coughs)

36:17.609 --> 36:19.478
I don't know what
you want from me.

36:19.511 --> 36:20.979
It ain't what we want.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.114
It's her you've
got to answer to.

36:25.251 --> 36:27.986
Oh, Cookie.

36:28.019 --> 36:29.821
Listen to Cookie. They
think that I did something

36:29.855 --> 36:33.158
to your...
to your granddaughter.

36:33.191 --> 36:36.528
I didn't do anything
to your granddaughter.

36:38.297 --> 36:40.866
I know, listen to Cookie.

36:40.899 --> 36:43.269
Just tell them, please.

36:43.302 --> 36:44.370
I don't believe you,

36:44.403 --> 36:46.004
so that's not gonna cut it.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.539
Cookie, no.

36:47.573 --> 36:49.775
Okay, look,

36:49.808 --> 36:54.280
when we broke up, I know...
things got weird,

36:54.313 --> 36:56.214
but you have to understand

36:56.248 --> 36:58.717
I would never do
anything like this.
COOKIE:
No. No, no, no.

36:58.750 --> 37:02.120
When we broke up,
you and your bougie-ass mama

37:02.153 --> 37:05.524
decided to wage a war on
my family, and it stops today.

37:05.557 --> 37:09.861
Look, Cookie. Please. Cookie.

37:09.895 --> 37:13.198
What?

37:13.231 --> 37:14.800
You broke my heart.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.968
Okay, now, I know I kind...

37:17.002 --> 37:19.471
I lashed out at
you and Lucious,

37:19.505 --> 37:21.307
and I'm sorry,
but I would never.

37:21.340 --> 37:23.108
I mean, you know me.
I wouldn't go this far.

37:23.141 --> 37:25.377
I wouldn't do anything
to your granddaughter.

37:25.411 --> 37:27.078
Okay, all right.

37:27.112 --> 37:28.747
Let's talk.

37:28.780 --> 37:31.983
I know that your mama
had something to do

37:32.017 --> 37:36.422
with my granddaughter being
snatched out of my arms.

37:36.455 --> 37:37.823
So...
No, no.

37:37.856 --> 37:41.126
...you can tell me where
she is and I'll let you go.

37:41.159 --> 37:42.394
How about that?

37:42.428 --> 37:45.664
I don't know where
she is, I don't know.
Hmm.

37:45.697 --> 37:47.899
I swear to you, I had nothing
to do with this.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.768
(chuckles)
I had nothing to do with this.

37:50.669 --> 37:53.104
Please believe me...

37:53.138 --> 37:53.939
(sighs)

37:53.972 --> 37:55.173
You know all those things

37:55.206 --> 37:57.576
your mama said about me?

37:57.609 --> 38:00.646
Being ghetto and hood?
No.

38:02.147 --> 38:04.015
I swear to you.
She was right.

38:04.049 --> 38:05.784
COOKIE:
Look at me.

38:05.817 --> 38:09.688
You need to talk to your mama

38:09.721 --> 38:13.859
'cause I know she knows
where my grandbaby at.

38:13.892 --> 38:15.193
Cookie.

38:15.226 --> 38:16.194
Cookie, Cookie.

38:16.227 --> 38:17.529
You're not gonna
get away with this.

38:17.563 --> 38:19.665
Watch me, bitch.
(chuckles)

38:19.698 --> 38:21.199
Go ahead, fellas.

38:21.232 --> 38:23.535
I was just kidding.
I was just kidding.

38:23.569 --> 38:24.603
Cookie, wait.
COOKIE: Bitch.

38:24.636 --> 38:25.904
Wait. Stop!

38:30.409 --> 38:32.043
(sighs) Look, I put the
squeeze on him, Lucious.

38:32.077 --> 38:34.045
I did everything.
He didn't budge.

38:34.079 --> 38:36.582
I honestly don't think
Angelo's in on it.

38:39.084 --> 38:43.455
Look, I promise you,
we're gonna get Bella back.

38:43.489 --> 38:46.157
Okay.

38:46.191 --> 38:48.827
Look, there's something
I need to tell you.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.896
When Cookie Met Lucious

38:50.929 --> 38:52.498
is going to be
on our stage in Vegas.

38:52.531 --> 38:54.900
I already talked to Marcone,
he agreed, it's done.

38:54.933 --> 38:56.067
Cookie.

38:56.101 --> 38:59.170
Look, this is what
the fans want, Lucious,

38:59.204 --> 39:00.038
me and you together.

39:00.071 --> 39:03.308
All this in-fighting
we've been doing,

39:03.341 --> 39:06.011
that's how Bella slipped
through the cracks. Come on.

39:06.044 --> 39:07.679
We need to come
together, Lucious.

39:07.713 --> 39:08.680
I don't think that's
going to happen.

39:08.714 --> 39:12.083
Lucious. It's a win-win
for the family.

39:12.117 --> 39:16.688
You get the show in Vegas
and Empire gets the casino.

39:16.722 --> 39:17.856
GIULIANA:
Oh, what do I get?

39:17.889 --> 39:19.925
Because Marcone
called and told me

39:19.958 --> 39:21.259
about your little
conversations.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.931
So I thought
I'd fly into town

39:25.964 --> 39:28.400
and make sure Lucious and I
were still on the same page.

39:30.101 --> 39:31.903
We are.

39:35.140 --> 39:37.042
Inferno is the Vegas deal,
Cookie.

39:37.075 --> 39:39.778
And Infer will be the show

39:39.811 --> 39:41.680
to launch Empire Casino.

39:41.713 --> 39:44.282
Jamal and I recorded
a track this morning.

39:44.315 --> 39:47.285
It's one that's
gonna be on Inferno.

39:47.318 --> 39:48.420
So, you're saying no

39:48.454 --> 39:51.356
to something that could bring
this family together?

39:51.389 --> 39:53.191
You do know that, Lucious.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.427
You know I love
my family, Cookie...

39:55.461 --> 39:57.796
(scoffs)

39:58.664 --> 40:02.000
...but I've made my choice.

40:16.815 --> 40:21.119
I did 17 years for you.

40:23.154 --> 40:26.692
Thank you for that, but
I'll take it from here.

40:42.708 --> 40:44.009
Hey.

40:44.042 --> 40:45.977
I've been calling
you all day.

40:46.011 --> 40:48.013
Where's your phone?

40:49.515 --> 40:51.282
My family needed me.

40:51.316 --> 40:55.253
So, When Cookie Met Lucious,
that's actually happening?

40:55.286 --> 40:56.688
I told Cookie
I'd think about it.

40:56.722 --> 40:58.456
Okay, so then
what's your plan, Dre?

40:58.490 --> 41:00.859
Because I know you don't
expect me to just sit

41:00.892 --> 41:03.028
and watch
from the audience.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.832
You can do whatever you want.

41:06.865 --> 41:09.300
It's between me and my family.

41:09.334 --> 41:10.468
You and your family?

41:10.502 --> 41:11.469
That's right.

41:11.503 --> 41:12.971
I thought I was family.

41:13.004 --> 41:14.305
Your mother disrespected me.

41:14.339 --> 41:15.874
And I thought you were
strong enough to take it.

41:15.907 --> 41:18.043
Tory Ash stole a song from me

41:18.076 --> 41:19.945
and you didn't do a
damn thing about it.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.814
Giuliana comes and
she dangles Vegas in your face,

41:22.848 --> 41:24.482
and what do you do?
You're ready to hit it.

41:24.516 --> 41:28.687
I told you,
that's how I do business.

41:28.720 --> 41:31.523
That's how you do business.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.393
This was never about me, was it?

41:35.426 --> 41:38.463
This was about you.

41:38.496 --> 41:41.633
You needed an artist
that you could control.

41:41.667 --> 41:43.334
Somebody whose
career boosted yours

41:43.368 --> 41:45.070
and you just,
you choose me, huh?

41:45.103 --> 41:48.807
Could've worked out for you.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.910
(scoffs)

41:51.943 --> 41:54.780
It still can.

41:57.616 --> 42:00.118
You're crazy.

42:04.222 --> 42:06.091
Am I?

42:08.359 --> 42:11.229
(gasping)

42:23.241 --> 42:25.210
DIANA:
Hold still, honey.

42:25.243 --> 42:28.780
I'm gonna go see the police
chief right after this. Ow.

42:28.814 --> 42:30.782
I'm so sorry.

42:30.816 --> 42:32.450
This isn't about Cookie anymore.

42:32.483 --> 42:37.288
I'm gonna make sure they're
all in jail, every last Lyon.

42:37.322 --> 42:38.957
No, Angelo.

42:38.990 --> 42:42.828
Extraordinary times call
for extraordinary measures.

42:47.633 --> 42:49.901
Let me see.

42:51.603 --> 42:53.504
Mama?

42:55.006 --> 42:57.876
(Bella cooing)
DIANA:
Ah.

42:57.909 --> 42:59.077
Mama, what did you do?

42:59.110 --> 43:04.249
Meet the newest member
of the Dubois family.

43:04.282 --> 43:06.251
(chuckles)

43:09.988 --> 43:13.291
They ruined one of mine,
so I took one of theirs.

43:14.359 --> 43:16.494
Didn't I?

43:16.527 --> 43:18.263
(Diana chuckles)

43:18.296 --> 43:19.297
Yes, I did.

43:19.330 --> 43:20.498
(coos)

43:20.531 --> 43:23.534
Yes, I did.

44:05.510 --> 44:07.178
ANNOUNCER: You've just
watched Empire.

44:07.212 --> 44:09.981
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:11.649 --> 44:14.219
Mommy has to go
out of town for work.

44:15.754 --> 44:17.388
Something
ain't right here.

44:17.422 --> 44:19.657
The department
is obviously corrupt.

44:19.691 --> 44:21.659
-I understand how you feel.
-No, you don't.

44:21.693 --> 44:24.495
My son is dead.

44:24.529 --> 44:26.564
-MAN:
You should go back to DC.
-(grunts)

44:26.597 --> 44:28.633
Their threats
don't faze me.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.836
This some sort
of game to you?

44:30.869 --> 44:33.104
ASHE: We're taking on
an entire sheriff's department.

44:35.373 --> 44:37.475
Nobody comes out
of this clean.

44:37.508 --> 44:40.111
ANNOUNCER: Shots Fired.
Wednesdays on Fox.
