00:39.373 --> 00:40.749
Go! Go! Keep moving!

00:48.507 --> 00:50.634
Go! Go! Keep moving!

00:52.261 --> 00:55.180
Mask on, boys, mask on!

01:01.562 --> 01:02.813
Mask on!

01:02.896 --> 01:05.147
-Where you going? Where you going?
-No, I'm going back.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.234
-Hey. Let me help you. Mask.
-No, I've gotta go back.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.152
Mask! Mask!

01:10.863 --> 01:11.989
Okay.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.074
My name's Leo. I'll be right behind you.

01:14.157 --> 01:17.452
Keep forward. Keep forward. Go! Go! Go!

01:17.536 --> 01:19.621
I'll be right behind you.

01:27.045 --> 01:29.423
Mask on! Mask!

01:39.349 --> 01:40.392
Mask on!

01:41.768 --> 01:42.769
…mask.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.691
Where's your mask?

01:54.489 --> 01:58.577
I've been shot.
Take me back. Take me back!

02:01.496 --> 02:03.415
Stop. Stop it, please!

04:11.001 --> 04:12.169
Bonne nuit!

04:17.882 --> 04:19.426
Took me a minute to find you.

04:20.135 --> 04:22.763
Yeah, I--
I left Teenie's as soon as I could.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.516
When did you get back?

04:25.599 --> 04:27.100
Little while ago.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.438
What have you been doing? Just dancing?

04:32.648 --> 04:35.734
Yeah. I was traveling a bit.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.695
I was dancing with a troupe.
We did the Orpheum Circuit.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.030
Oh, wow.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.366
And you? How was it?

04:43.742 --> 04:48.914
It's-- It's not like how they write
in the papers.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.959
-They never actually talk to any soldiers.
-I do.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.503
I hear they just hand out medals
on the ride home.

04:55.254 --> 04:56.255
How many did you get?

04:57.381 --> 04:58.590
I just got the ride.

05:01.760 --> 05:05.389
It sounded-- sounded bad over there.

05:06.515 --> 05:07.850
I wrote you.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.479
When I stopped by Teenie's,
they said that they--

05:12.563 --> 05:13.856
they sent my letters on.

05:16.358 --> 05:17.568
I never got any.

05:22.281 --> 05:26.285
So tonight,
what did you think my dance was about?

05:28.203 --> 05:30.831
I didn't know it had to be about anything.

05:32.249 --> 05:36.545
It was the story of Josephine,
the first wife of Napoleon.

05:36.628 --> 05:39.089
She's lighting a fire to Osiris.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.175
She's begging him for a child.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.804
I don't know if anybody got that
from what I saw.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.015
Yeah.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.400
How long you been doing this?

05:58.483 --> 06:02.613
This is my third run,
but I might book the Balaban.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.782
-Really?
-I've got the numbers just about.

06:08.202 --> 06:09.536
Kind of a small crowd, no?

06:09.620 --> 06:12.331
That's how they like it. They pay more.

06:16.919 --> 06:18.420
I brought you something back.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.008
What makes you think I want it?

06:23.800 --> 06:26.303
Well, you can speak French now,
but I still know you.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.474
It's Parisian.

06:39.316 --> 06:40.484
What happened here?

06:40.567 --> 06:43.737
It caught on my pocketknife.
I sewed it though.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.034
Paris?

06:50.702 --> 06:52.704
When did you get such good taste?

06:59.628 --> 07:01.129
It's fine, but just look.

07:01.213 --> 07:03.882
We shouldn't be out here.
Harper, I don't do this anymore.

07:03.966 --> 07:06.635
Come on. Just look.
You'll know this.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.303
What are they made out of?

07:09.972 --> 07:11.139
Silk?

07:12.099 --> 07:13.392
Nah, rayon.

07:13.976 --> 07:16.478
-No, she's too rich for that.
-No, look. They're running thin.

07:16.562 --> 07:17.855
She wears that pair to church.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.065
A woman doesn't put on silk
to get on her knees.

07:20.816 --> 07:22.317
How do you know her?

07:23.151 --> 07:26.613
You remember Sister Flora
from Saint Michael's?

07:27.364 --> 07:29.616
Yeah. The one who used to try
to baptize us in the lake?

07:29.700 --> 07:31.660
Yeah, yeah. She's--
She's at Saint Adalbert's now.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.078
I bumped into her.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.706
She runs a veteran's dinner
on Wednesdays in the basements.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.124
That's where she's headed tonight.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.126
So, she fed you and you followed her home?

07:40.169 --> 07:41.920
That's how you taught me to do it.

07:42.004 --> 07:44.381
We were kids.
I thought you would've come up

07:44.464 --> 07:45.924
with something else by now.

07:46.008 --> 07:48.635
She's out. She's out. Come on. Let's go.

07:48.719 --> 07:49.928
What? Harper, no.

07:50.012 --> 07:52.055
I don't need to rob
little old ladies anymore.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.349
Fine. I'll just give
the silk stockings to someone else.

08:00.564 --> 08:01.899
What?

08:02.900 --> 08:03.901
Come on.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.947
Oh, my God.

08:10.741 --> 08:12.409
What else you got back there, huh?

08:13.660 --> 08:15.204
What about this one?

08:18.207 --> 08:20.709
Why do they always leave
the little heads on those things anyway?

08:20.792 --> 08:22.461
It's fashion.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.631
Didn't all the girls
wear things like this in Paris?

08:27.424 --> 08:29.051
How should I know? Huh?

08:29.134 --> 08:31.345
-Well, you have eyes, don't you?
-You know what?

08:32.929 --> 08:34.640
I didn't have time to look, so…

08:35.224 --> 08:37.226
Harp, you always look.

08:38.309 --> 08:41.313
You'd hide under a cattle box
and spy on me.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.360
No, I wasn't spying on you.

08:46.443 --> 08:49.530
Yes. You were peeping like a little rat.

08:51.406 --> 08:54.284
Is that what you--
Is that what you think I was doing?

08:54.368 --> 08:56.578
-Then what were you doing?
-I was looking out for you.

09:00.457 --> 09:01.667
What?

09:05.337 --> 09:06.755
What's that?

09:07.422 --> 09:08.632
I don't know.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.719
It's coming from over there.

09:13.637 --> 09:15.389
-In here?
-No, here, here.

09:20.936 --> 09:22.354
-Is that--
-Harper.

09:22.437 --> 09:23.730
Hang on. Hang on.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.527
Hang on. Hang on.

09:33.282 --> 09:34.283
-That's it.
-That it?

09:34.366 --> 09:35.617
Yeah.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.995
What? Let me see that.

09:40.122 --> 09:41.290
-What is that?
-Wait.

09:44.293 --> 09:45.627
It's different now.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.131
How'd it do that?

09:51.133 --> 09:52.968
-Shit. Let's go.
-Yeah.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.761
-Harper. Someone's coming.
-I'll be right there.

09:55.888 --> 09:57.681
Harper, what are you doing? Let's go.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.266
Right there.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.157
Where'd you get this?

10:17.159 --> 10:18.619
Where did you get the watch from?

10:20.746 --> 10:23.540
I know you. Saint Adalbert's.

10:24.166 --> 10:25.709
You never pray before the meal.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.252
No, you don't know me.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.421
You get out! Get out! Get out!

10:29.505 --> 10:31.548
-Get out! Get out!
-Stop! Stop!

10:31.632 --> 10:33.425
I just wanna know about the watch.

10:33.509 --> 10:35.010
I just wanna know about the watch.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.012
-I have money. I have money.
-Is it from Europe?

10:37.095 --> 10:39.223
-Huh? Is that where you got it from?
-I don't know.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.308
No, you do know 'cause you hid it good.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.060
You know what it is.
You know what it's worth.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.895
Tell me. Where'd you get it?

10:44.978 --> 10:47.689
You could never know.
You're a small man.

10:47.773 --> 10:49.399
And you're a fucking bitch.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.276
You think I don't know who you are?

10:52.194 --> 10:54.571
That's your husband's picture
on your dresser.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.324
And you light that same candle
for him every night.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.408
Yeah.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.079
Been watching you.

11:03.205 --> 11:04.623
Now, you can't lie to me.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.376
So…

11:10.295 --> 11:11.547
where'd you get the watch?

11:19.847 --> 11:21.473
What happened up there?

11:21.557 --> 11:22.641
Nothing.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.268
Just ducked under the bed.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.144
Why did you stay behind?

11:27.771 --> 11:29.773
Well, to make sure she didn't spot you.

11:29.857 --> 11:32.484
You got the Balaban coming up.
I didn't want her to ruin that, you know?

11:36.196 --> 11:37.281
What?

11:38.073 --> 11:39.616
We used to do this all the time.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.077
Yeah, when there was no one at home.
She could've called the police.

11:42.160 --> 11:45.747
She didn't see me. Look what I got you.

11:46.331 --> 11:50.836
Look. Here. Give me your wrist.
I mean, look at that, huh.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.504
It's made for you.

11:56.675 --> 11:59.011
I'll go and give it back to her,
if that's what you want.

11:59.094 --> 12:00.345
I don't need it. It's hers.

12:00.429 --> 12:02.556
Well, she didn't do anything
to deserve it.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.641
You know, she puts on cheap stockings

12:04.725 --> 12:06.393
to come down
to church and give me her charity.

12:06.476 --> 12:09.605
It's a hustle for God's grace,
and she's gotten way more of that than us.

12:10.647 --> 12:14.443
You know?
We need to take what we're owed.

12:18.488 --> 12:19.573
Look.

12:26.330 --> 12:28.081
6:00 a.m. in Paris.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.091
Pony up, boys. Pony up.

12:40.469 --> 12:43.972
All bets down. Bets down.
All bets down. Here we go.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.561
Bets down. All bets down.
And watch her spin.

12:49.645 --> 12:51.313
Watch her spin, watch her spin.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.148
And-and-and-and-and-and…

12:54.483 --> 12:57.277
Look at that. Who wants to go again? Huh?

12:57.361 --> 12:58.862
-Bets down. Bets down.
-No, no.

12:58.946 --> 13:01.114
That's three out of four for you.
No fucking way that happens.

13:01.198 --> 13:02.824
I don't like losers anyway.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.618
Who wants to spin? Huh?

13:04.701 --> 13:06.912
Harp! You wanna lay down some change here?

13:08.080 --> 13:09.748
You're gonna take
the wrong man's nickel someday.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.209
What's wrong with you, huh?

13:13.377 --> 13:14.628
They hiring today?

13:14.711 --> 13:17.172
Just signed up a few loaders
for Marshall Field's.

13:17.256 --> 13:19.091
Might pull some of us in
for the anchor watch.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.968
-Oh, God.
-What?

13:21.051 --> 13:22.594
-Nah.
-No?

13:23.345 --> 13:24.847
I'll come back tomorrow.

13:24.930 --> 13:26.181
Hey, where you goin'?

13:26.265 --> 13:28.350
I don't know.
Back to the Hopkins, I guess.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.977
How'd it go with your new girl?

13:30.060 --> 13:31.228
She's not new.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.563
She lend you some money?

13:32.646 --> 13:34.690
No. Why?

13:34.773 --> 13:36.817
You're usually the last one left,
not the first one leaving.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.319
Hey, hey, hey. What do you have?

13:40.362 --> 13:43.824
Nothing, nothing. Nothing.
It's nothing.

13:49.580 --> 13:51.498
There's a spot I heard about.

13:54.293 --> 13:58.505
It's-- I might go see what's there.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.048
Where?

14:01.091 --> 14:02.134
It's in Lake View.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.471
Let's run back to the Hopkins first,
grab our kits.

14:06.555 --> 14:07.973
What do we need the kits for?

14:09.641 --> 14:11.059
Come on. Let's go.

14:14.104 --> 14:16.148
Legion. Support your local Legion.

14:17.482 --> 14:20.402
Legion. Support your local Legion.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.991
Legion, ma'am? Support your local Legion?

14:26.074 --> 14:28.785
No, thank you. So, yeah.

14:32.456 --> 14:33.832
-Is this it?
-I guess.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.962
It's not what I thought
it would look like.

14:42.257 --> 14:44.343
-What's it supposed to look like?
-I don't know.

15:15.624 --> 15:16.959
You know what you're doing?

15:20.546 --> 15:21.964
Could be someone home.

15:23.340 --> 15:25.717
There's an inch
of dust on those shutters.

15:25.801 --> 15:27.177
No one's here.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.350
Come on, come on.

15:52.578 --> 15:54.204
Whose house is this anyways?

15:54.955 --> 15:56.582
I only know the cousin.

15:56.665 --> 15:59.209
She says he travels all over.
He likes to collect nice things.

16:13.557 --> 16:14.725
You hear that?

16:16.101 --> 16:18.687
Fuck me. His cousin wasn't lying.

16:26.945 --> 16:29.615
Don't get any ideas.
We're not carrying that thing.

16:33.952 --> 16:35.662
Where'd he get this stuff?

16:36.246 --> 16:37.664
All over, I guess.

16:40.083 --> 16:41.710
Who covers up their windows like this?

16:43.420 --> 16:45.964
-What's he so scared of?
-People like us.

16:57.351 --> 16:59.228
-You sure no one's home?
-Can't be.

16:59.311 --> 17:02.064
They would've heard us by now.
See what they got upstairs.

18:22.561 --> 18:23.896
What the fuck?

18:44.374 --> 18:46.460
Must be a little tight in there.
You all right?

18:50.130 --> 18:52.799
Your concern is noted.
You can leave now.

18:52.883 --> 18:55.052
There's money in the trunk downstairs.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.179
-Take it and go.
-Well…

18:58.430 --> 19:00.182
that's very generous of you.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.439
Take it easy. Easy, easy, easy.

19:07.523 --> 19:09.358
How much money do you need?

19:09.441 --> 19:11.360
-Wait, what?
-To go.

19:11.860 --> 19:12.945
How much do you want?

19:13.946 --> 19:16.073
You tell me. It's your house.

19:17.491 --> 19:19.326
What war did you fight in?

19:21.328 --> 19:23.539
The only war. The Great War.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.415
World War One or Two?

19:26.667 --> 19:29.002
-There's a second one?
-So, the first.

19:29.086 --> 19:30.254
And you just returned.

19:30.838 --> 19:34.049
Now, it must be then, what?
1918, nineteen-nine--

19:34.132 --> 19:37.177
It's 1920. Why don't you know that? Huh?

19:55.112 --> 19:57.698
When was the last time you left
this house? Huh?

19:59.324 --> 20:01.034
What month, day is it?

20:01.118 --> 20:02.411
It's-- It's October 9th.

20:02.494 --> 20:04.079
I have not been to this day.

20:04.663 --> 20:06.623
What do you mean? You're here right now.

20:10.627 --> 20:13.630
What about the watch?
The watch that you gave Britta.

20:15.507 --> 20:17.050
Did you make that?

20:17.634 --> 20:18.844
Is that why you're here?

20:18.927 --> 20:20.429
-You want to know how it's made?
-Well--

20:20.512 --> 20:23.432
-You're a craftsman?
-I mean, I could be.

20:25.726 --> 20:28.729
No. You don't make things.
You just want them.

20:36.987 --> 20:40.949
Here. I buy these at Sydel's.
The one on Wacker.

20:42.034 --> 20:43.327
Now you can leave.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.873
Now why do I feel like
you're buying me off cheap, huh?

20:48.540 --> 20:49.625
Come on.

20:54.004 --> 20:55.380
You take it easy now.

20:56.423 --> 20:57.674
Where you from, huh?

21:00.010 --> 21:01.386
Who are you?

21:01.470 --> 21:02.846
So, you will want it now.

21:03.597 --> 21:04.723
What?

21:04.806 --> 21:06.183
Maybe it's for the better.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.267
I can--

21:10.103 --> 21:11.897
I can find a time to make my own.

21:13.232 --> 21:17.152
You'll see, we can only pass through here.

21:17.236 --> 21:19.905
Until then, the house has its own ways.

21:19.988 --> 21:21.865
-What the fuck are you doing?
-I'm just talking.

21:21.949 --> 21:25.077
-I'm dealing with it.
-Leave him. Let him go. Just--

21:42.344 --> 21:45.138
Sir. Sir, are you okay?

21:45.222 --> 21:46.974
Someone call an ambulance!

21:53.105 --> 21:55.357
-Oh, my God.
-Someone call an ambulance.

22:09.329 --> 22:10.789
Harper?

22:11.832 --> 22:12.833
Harp--

22:14.751 --> 22:16.044
Where'd you get that?

22:17.004 --> 22:19.131
I got it off Charlie.

22:21.383 --> 22:22.718
Who's Charlie?

22:22.801 --> 22:24.595
He's a pilot. He's from England.

22:24.678 --> 22:26.555
He flew Bristols, but who knows.

22:27.556 --> 22:28.640
He sold it to me.

22:28.724 --> 22:30.184
It keeps my chest clear.

22:30.851 --> 22:32.519
Well, doesn't sound like it's helping.

22:33.854 --> 22:34.980
You know what you need?

22:35.063 --> 22:36.565
-I'm fine.
-Lie down on the floor.

22:36.648 --> 22:38.275
-Come here. Come.
-It's my nerves.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.277
I'm auditioning for the Balaban tomorrow.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.821
Radium? This doesn't make it any better.

22:43.322 --> 22:44.990
You need to get some rest.

22:55.125 --> 22:57.085
Come to my house. You can get ready there.

22:58.337 --> 22:59.546
-Your house?
-Yeah.

23:00.714 --> 23:02.841
-You have a wife now too?
-Not yet.

23:05.469 --> 23:08.555
My lieutenant, it's his brother's place.
He travels all over.

23:08.639 --> 23:10.557
He needs someone
to look after it while he's gone.

23:10.641 --> 23:12.184
And he trusts you with it?

23:12.267 --> 23:13.644
He's got a lot of nice things.

23:14.478 --> 23:16.939
Doesn't mind having a doughboy
guarding them for him.

23:17.773 --> 23:20.025
You've done all of this since last week?

23:20.609 --> 23:21.818
Lie down, lie down.

23:24.071 --> 23:25.447
Let me get you your breath back.

23:25.989 --> 23:26.990
Come on.

23:34.206 --> 23:35.749
Just wait.

23:45.801 --> 23:47.344
No, you have to keep looking up.

23:48.512 --> 23:51.431
-Yeah, it's fine. Why do we--
-Look, there!

24:00.524 --> 24:02.693
-How did you--
-I didn't. It just happened.

24:25.340 --> 24:26.633
Make it change again.

24:27.259 --> 24:30.345
I can't. It just-- does it on its own.
I don't know why.

24:31.305 --> 24:33.265
Wait, what is this?

24:33.765 --> 24:36.018
Come on, Harp. How'd you do that?

24:36.852 --> 24:38.187
It's--

24:40.230 --> 24:45.903
Inside here… things become something else.

24:47.070 --> 24:48.947
Sometimes they're older,
sometimes they're newer,

24:49.031 --> 24:50.949
sometimes they're just different.

24:51.033 --> 24:52.743
Stuff I've never even seen before.

24:53.702 --> 24:56.246
It can happen to anything.
Carpets, lamps, whatever.

24:58.081 --> 24:59.374
What?

25:00.292 --> 25:01.877
Your lieutenant's brother,

25:03.253 --> 25:05.130
-what does he do?
-I don't know.

25:05.631 --> 25:08.842
He must be an importer.
Probably where he got all this stuff.

25:11.428 --> 25:15.682
If this place were mine,
I wouldn't leave it to anyone.

25:17.059 --> 25:19.186
Nobody just let you walk in here.

25:19.811 --> 25:21.271
Well, we're not leaving now.

25:21.897 --> 25:23.315
Come on, I want to show you this.

25:23.398 --> 25:25.359
Harp, tell me whose house this is.

25:26.777 --> 25:29.112
Fine. No, you know what, you're right.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.866
We should go. Come on.

25:36.203 --> 25:37.371
Okay.

25:37.454 --> 25:40.165
Think of sometime else. Like, any time.

25:41.583 --> 25:42.876
-Why?
-Please, just do it.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.545
Just think of a time.

25:44.628 --> 25:46.588
-Like a memory?
-No, like a day, a year.

25:46.672 --> 25:49.800
-Whenever. Go on. Pick one.
-A thousand years from now.

25:50.384 --> 25:53.011
Well, no, not that far ahead.
Nothing will still be standing by then.

25:53.095 --> 25:54.888
-I don't understand--
-'Cause you're not listening.

25:54.972 --> 25:57.683
Think of a day, years from now.
Think of what the world could be.

25:58.267 --> 25:59.560
What day do you wanna see?

26:00.477 --> 26:02.688
I wanna go as far from now as possible.

26:03.397 --> 26:04.648
Give me your hand.

26:08.026 --> 26:09.611
How did you do this?

26:09.695 --> 26:11.363
How did you do this?

26:11.446 --> 26:13.365
I don't know. Just did.

26:21.915 --> 26:23.500
Look at that.

26:27.254 --> 26:28.839
-We shouldn't be here.
-Why?

26:29.631 --> 26:31.675
It's no different than looking
in someone's window.

26:31.758 --> 26:34.386
Yes, but everything else
is supposed to be here, not us.

26:34.469 --> 26:35.971
Hasn't it always felt like that?

26:38.348 --> 26:39.808
How did you do this?

26:42.394 --> 26:44.563
Maybe this is who
I was always supposed to be.

26:47.274 --> 26:50.235
So, you just pick a date
and you walk through the door?

26:50.319 --> 26:52.529
Yeah. It's what's worked so far.

26:53.947 --> 26:55.782
Why can't you go further than today?

26:55.866 --> 26:57.409
I don't know. I just can't.

26:59.077 --> 27:00.954
Have you tried?
What happens if you try?

27:01.538 --> 27:03.373
I always go back to the first day
I walked in.

27:03.457 --> 27:05.751
-I don't know.
-But why's today the last day?

27:05.834 --> 27:07.127
-I don't know.
-Well, what if--

27:07.211 --> 27:09.796
what if the world ends tomorrow
and then we all go back to the beginning?

27:09.880 --> 27:12.508
I mean, does it matter?
Isn't this enough? Look.

27:15.177 --> 27:16.845
I don't know what this is.

27:20.224 --> 27:21.391
You wanna go back?

27:21.475 --> 27:26.063
No. Not at all.
Maybe-- Maybe not ever.

27:28.982 --> 27:30.275
We can stay here then.

27:34.196 --> 27:35.489
You know my letters?

27:37.032 --> 27:39.952
The guys at Teenie's,
they told me that they gave them to you.

27:41.119 --> 27:43.205
Yeah,
instead of the pay that they owe me.

27:45.207 --> 27:46.875
Why didn't you write me back?

27:52.881 --> 27:55.050
-I didn't know what to say.
-You could've said anything.

27:55.133 --> 27:56.927
I would've wanted
to hear anything from you.

27:59.304 --> 28:03.475
I-- I hope you brought cash.

28:03.559 --> 28:05.185
You still owe me silk stockings.

28:07.354 --> 28:08.480
Let's go.

28:10.774 --> 28:12.651
-Oh, no.
-I can never tell the difference.

28:14.778 --> 28:16.989
Why doesn't that one have
a little fox head on it?

28:17.072 --> 28:19.491
It doesn't need one.
It's fancy enough already.

28:19.575 --> 28:21.368
-I see. That's what it is.
-Yes.

28:26.373 --> 28:27.374
Hey.

28:28.333 --> 28:29.501
Where you been?

28:30.335 --> 28:31.920
Just poking around.

28:32.504 --> 28:36.842
I tried to find you,
but I opened the door, nothing happened.

28:40.429 --> 28:42.973
I was just outside.

28:44.766 --> 28:48.228
Really? Well, it worked for me.

28:50.564 --> 28:53.859
Leo, this is Klara.

28:55.652 --> 28:57.112
Klara from when you were kids?

28:57.905 --> 28:59.489
Yes, that's me.

29:03.327 --> 29:05.495
-I'm gonna put these upstairs.
-Okay, sure, sure.

29:13.795 --> 29:15.464
You showed her?

29:16.632 --> 29:18.550
She needed a place to stay.

29:18.634 --> 29:21.762
-She's staying here too?
-If she needs to, yes.

29:21.845 --> 29:23.764
I didn't know we were doing that.

29:23.847 --> 29:26.350
Why don't we grab our buckets
and start charging people?

29:26.433 --> 29:28.769
Well, you know what,
she's not "people." All right?

29:29.394 --> 29:31.104
Doesn't matter. I didn't agree to it.

29:31.188 --> 29:33.106
Oh, really, Leo? You know what?

29:33.190 --> 29:34.942
I don't care what you think.

29:39.571 --> 29:40.822
When did this start?

29:42.491 --> 29:45.494
We found this place together. It's ours.

29:46.119 --> 29:47.287
Well,

29:49.581 --> 29:51.166
you can't go anywhere with it.

29:54.586 --> 29:56.046
Not without me.

29:59.508 --> 30:03.011
You couldn't even get your mask on
without me.

30:03.554 --> 30:05.305
Where do you think you're going?

30:06.098 --> 30:08.141
So, where to next, Captain?

30:10.769 --> 30:12.104
Well, look at you.

30:14.606 --> 30:16.608
I know where. Come on, yeah.

30:16.692 --> 30:18.151
Are you coming?

30:18.777 --> 30:21.738
You two go ahead.
Someone better stay, watch the place.

30:22.990 --> 30:26.785
Come on, the best view in the house
is right outside those doors.

30:28.662 --> 30:30.873
Come on, Harp, open your door.

30:48.599 --> 30:49.766
Hey!

30:50.934 --> 30:52.603
Hey!

30:54.980 --> 30:56.231
What do you think?

30:57.441 --> 31:00.027
I don't think I could make
any money off this crowd.

31:00.110 --> 31:01.612
I can't believe this is the same place.

31:01.695 --> 31:04.156
You know, the ceilings,
the floors, it's all the same.

31:04.239 --> 31:06.491
I would have thought they could
come up with something new.

31:06.575 --> 31:07.993
Nobody seems to mind.

31:09.912 --> 31:11.121
You want another drink?

31:11.955 --> 31:13.332
Yeah, buy me another.

31:19.963 --> 31:21.715
So can you come back to the same day?

31:21.798 --> 31:23.050
Over and over if you wanted?

31:23.133 --> 31:25.177
Yeah, maybe. I don't see why not.

31:28.055 --> 31:29.431
Hey, what are you guys having?

31:32.142 --> 31:33.769
-Right.
-Whiskey neat.

31:34.853 --> 31:36.813
-Okay. From the well okay?
-Yeah.

31:40.317 --> 31:42.194
-Those are pretty.
-Sorry, what?

31:42.694 --> 31:44.738
Your earrings, I like them.
Where'd you get them?

31:45.906 --> 31:46.823
I don't know.

31:46.907 --> 31:50.327
My ex gave them to me the first time
we went out instead of flowers.

31:50.410 --> 31:52.162
At least you got
something decent out of it.

31:52.246 --> 31:54.665
-Thank you.
-You went shopping today.

31:55.916 --> 31:57.251
How did you know?

32:02.548 --> 32:04.007
Do you ever get to dance?

32:04.091 --> 32:05.676
Not while I'm working.

32:05.759 --> 32:07.261
That's too bad.

32:15.060 --> 32:16.353
What was that all about?

32:17.729 --> 32:20.566
You like her.
I was trying to keep her around for you.

32:23.610 --> 32:25.112
She's not the one I want.

32:32.995 --> 32:34.496
You sure about that?

32:36.081 --> 32:37.291
Come on. Just one.

32:37.374 --> 32:40.586
-No, I can't.
-Just a quick one. Come on. Let's go.

33:27.841 --> 33:30.344
-Come on, dance with me.
-Oh, no. Not now.

33:30.928 --> 33:31.887
Fine.

33:34.515 --> 33:35.933
I'm going to find the powder room,

33:36.016 --> 33:37.476
but when I'm back, you be ready.

33:37.559 --> 33:39.645
They don't call it that anymore.
It's just a toilet.

33:40.270 --> 33:43.023
Fine. Just the toilet. I'll be right back.

33:53.784 --> 33:54.826
Hey!

33:54.910 --> 33:57.371
You really like the sound of this, huh?

33:59.331 --> 34:01.542
I always thought I couldn't dance.

34:01.625 --> 34:04.545
But it was just the wrong music.

34:04.628 --> 34:05.712
Yeah.

34:05.796 --> 34:07.506
Well, we'll see how you feel tomorrow.

34:07.589 --> 34:11.217
Yeah, well, I won't be feeling it alone.

34:12.344 --> 34:14.388
Is this what the girls in Paris were like?

34:15.472 --> 34:18.100
-Huh?
-When you went with Harp.

34:19.851 --> 34:21.186
He must've had a French girl.

34:23.105 --> 34:25.023
He only talked about you.

34:27.693 --> 34:30.571
Well, what happened over there?
He's different.

34:30.654 --> 34:32.406
Different how?

34:34.867 --> 34:37.703
He takes up space more.

34:38.453 --> 34:40.581
Just doesn't know what to do with it yet.

34:41.790 --> 34:43.000
Maybe he got taller.

34:48.088 --> 34:49.672
I can't say.

34:50.966 --> 34:52.134
I never knew him before.

34:53.010 --> 34:54.219
But you were with him.

35:01.185 --> 35:05.439
I don't think he became
someone he wasn't already.

35:06.648 --> 35:10.694
Maybe you just didn't know him
as well as you thought you did.

35:15.240 --> 35:19.828
We never made it to Paris,
if that's what he told you.

35:22.164 --> 35:24.249
There you are.
I've been looking for you.

35:26.627 --> 35:27.711
Let's go.

35:29.796 --> 35:31.215
What's under my coat?

35:32.382 --> 35:33.675
That's for later.

35:35.636 --> 35:36.637
Let's go.

35:37.137 --> 35:38.305
What about Leo?

35:40.557 --> 35:43.435
I don't think he's planning
on coming home with us. Come on.

35:49.191 --> 35:50.651
Know how to work that thing?

35:51.276 --> 35:52.444
I'm getting there.

35:54.780 --> 35:55.822
How'd you swipe it?

35:57.157 --> 35:58.325
I paid for it.

35:58.408 --> 36:00.244
You don't have to steal
when you have money.

36:00.744 --> 36:01.912
Sure.

36:04.581 --> 36:06.834
-Oh, no, Harper, I'm gonna put it back up.
-No.

36:06.917 --> 36:09.086
-It's gonna get this shit all over it.
-No, leave it down.

36:09.169 --> 36:11.338
There. You can wash it out.

36:12.089 --> 36:13.090
There.

36:13.173 --> 36:15.592
-This isn't how I do my act.
-No, it'll look better. You ready?

36:16.593 --> 36:18.345
Yeah. Yeah.

36:18.428 --> 36:19.847
Come on.

36:19.930 --> 36:21.139
Let's see.

36:22.516 --> 36:23.684
All right, get going.

36:27.729 --> 36:28.981
No, no, not like that.

36:29.064 --> 36:33.110
Like Teenie's. Just be you. No French.

36:34.361 --> 36:36.029
Why? Does it remind you too much of Paris?

36:36.113 --> 36:37.739
Well, yeah, maybe it does.

36:38.407 --> 36:39.616
Ready?

36:40.117 --> 36:42.035
I know you didn't make it there.
Leo said so.

36:43.537 --> 36:45.080
He doesn't know where I've been.

36:46.582 --> 36:48.458
Now, the camera's rolling.
Are you gonna start or not?

36:49.918 --> 36:51.336
No, I'm not.

36:55.465 --> 36:56.717
Turn it off.

37:01.096 --> 37:04.850
Tell me where you got this.
I know it wasn't in Paris.

37:06.810 --> 37:11.273
I-- I took it off someone who died.

37:16.945 --> 37:20.324
He didn't have anyone to give it to,
and I did.

37:24.203 --> 37:28.457
Okay, fine. Just don't lie to me.

37:34.338 --> 37:38.383
So what happens when you sleep here?
Does-- You wake up still the same?

37:38.467 --> 37:39.593
I think so.

37:42.429 --> 37:47.684
You know, when-- when I found this place…

37:50.938 --> 37:53.357
you were the only one I wanted
to show it to.

38:10.207 --> 38:12.793
Harper. Shit,

38:12.876 --> 38:15.212
-I'm getting this all over the place.
-No, sheets don't matter.

38:15.295 --> 38:16.755
-Let's turn the camera back on…
-Take it easy.

38:16.839 --> 38:18.215
-…and do it again.
-Just come sit back down.

38:18.298 --> 38:19.466
-No, I'm ready.
-Just get back over here.

38:19.550 --> 38:21.134
-Get back here!
-Harper, no!

38:21.218 --> 38:22.928
-Come here. Just--
-Harper, what's wrong with you?

38:23.011 --> 38:24.972
-Harper, no!
-Come over here.

38:25.055 --> 38:27.099
Just get back over here! You always do!

38:30.519 --> 38:32.312
What do you mean "always"?

38:33.981 --> 38:35.190
-I didn't--
-Harper!

38:37.651 --> 38:39.528
Have we done this before?

38:39.611 --> 38:40.654
Done what?

38:42.114 --> 38:44.116
Have we come back to today, to tonight?

38:45.492 --> 38:47.244
To all of this?

38:50.539 --> 38:51.540
How many times?

38:51.623 --> 38:54.209
What does it matter? It doesn't matter.

38:55.794 --> 38:57.045
How do you do this?

38:57.129 --> 38:59.798
I walk out the back door,

39:01.383 --> 39:04.303
and I come and find you.

39:05.512 --> 39:08.557
We go out, then we come home.

39:09.600 --> 39:14.938
And we always just end up here.

39:18.650 --> 39:19.985
Why don't I remember?

39:21.987 --> 39:23.697
Because it's not your house.

39:27.075 --> 39:29.786
Klara, wait. Wait. It's late.

39:29.870 --> 39:31.830
-Please. Please just stay, please!
-Get off me.

39:32.581 --> 39:34.958
You can come back
as many times as you want.

39:35.042 --> 39:38.462
I'll always know, Harper,
because I know you.

39:38.962 --> 39:40.797
You watched me. I watched you.

39:41.507 --> 39:42.674
You weren't much back then.

39:42.758 --> 39:45.385
Now all of this,
it makes you look even smaller.

39:47.596 --> 39:48.514
Harper!

39:48.597 --> 39:51.600
No, no, no! No, no, no. No!

39:52.309 --> 39:54.311
Get off me! No.

40:02.819 --> 40:04.404
One, two, three, down.

40:09.910 --> 40:10.911
Ready.

40:10.994 --> 40:12.496
One, two, three.

40:49.241 --> 40:51.243
Look, we're both still on our feet, huh?

40:53.453 --> 40:56.290
Saw you out there. Knew you'd make it.

40:59.877 --> 41:02.880
How'd you see anything?
There was smoke everywhere.

41:03.630 --> 41:06.466
It's-- It's Leo, right?

41:09.386 --> 41:10.679
He was with your company?

41:12.139 --> 41:13.682
Yeah. Yeah.

41:13.765 --> 41:16.059
They'll want your account
to send to his family.

41:16.894 --> 41:18.395
Figure out something to say.

41:20.272 --> 41:22.274
You might want to leave that with him.

41:23.108 --> 41:24.484
That's his mask, right?

41:26.278 --> 41:28.155
I told you I'd be right behind you.

43:10.424 --> 43:12.134
Do you want something? It's last call.

43:12.968 --> 43:15.304
-Same as last time.
-And that is…

43:16.972 --> 43:18.390
Whiskey neat.

43:24.479 --> 43:25.731
Those earrings are pretty.

43:25.814 --> 43:27.274
Yeah, you like 'em?

43:28.275 --> 43:30.527
You let me hold 'em,
I can tell you where they're from.

43:32.112 --> 43:37.868
And if I'm wrong, this is yours.

43:39.828 --> 43:41.914
If you're trying to steal them,
they're not worth anything.

43:41.997 --> 43:44.208
I'll give them back. Come on.

43:49.379 --> 43:52.299
Let's see. All right, all right.

43:52.382 --> 43:54.760
Well, not too old.

43:55.469 --> 43:56.970
Two, maybe three years.

43:58.138 --> 43:59.348
A man bought them for you.

44:00.933 --> 44:04.603
But they're not nice enough for you two
to have been together long.

44:06.146 --> 44:11.777
So, maybe a gag gift on a first date.

44:16.949 --> 44:19.368
Nope, I picked them out for myself.

44:19.451 --> 44:21.495
They're from the dollar store.
You can keep 'em.

44:24.665 --> 44:25.999
I wasn't wrong.

44:26.834 --> 44:28.377
I guess we'll never know.
