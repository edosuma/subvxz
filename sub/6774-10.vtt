00:01.068 --> 00:02.534
 Liv: <i> Previously on</i> izombie...

00:02.536 --> 00:03.936
        Eliza marquette,

00:03.937 --> 00:06.338
    Director of advertising
    at max rager.

00:06.340 --> 00:09.541
 This secret report that
 max rager had these seriously
 dangerous side effects.

00:09.543 --> 00:10.909
      Eliza said she would
      take care of it.

00:10.911 --> 00:12.211
        Major: <i> The candyman!</i>

00:12.213 --> 00:13.879
     <i> He broke into my house.</i>

00:13.881 --> 00:15.247
        (gunshots fired)

00:15.249 --> 00:16.715
     Major: <i> I killed a man.</i>

00:16.717 --> 00:18.117
        Clive: <i> Show me.</i>

00:18.119 --> 00:20.052
    You know,
    he collapsed right here.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.754
      Have you been taking
      any medications?

00:21.756 --> 00:24.089
     You won't assign even
     one detective to look
     into the missing kids

00:24.091 --> 00:25.457
  From nine trolls skate park?

00:25.459 --> 00:27.393
    Blaine killed those kids
    and i ate those brains.

00:27.395 --> 00:28.794
       Blaine has to die.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.162
      I'm gonna kill him.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.299
           (mouthing)

00:36.737 --> 00:37.936
          (shot fired)

00:37.938 --> 00:39.004
          (screaming)

00:42.610 --> 00:44.476
      Liv: <i> He was like that</i>
     <i> when i got there.</i>

00:44.478 --> 00:46.578
  Flynn: You said you arrived
  just before 10:30.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.915
   Neighbors heard a shot
   in mr. Tracey's apartment
   10 minutes before.

00:49.917 --> 00:51.083
      Where were you then?

00:55.489 --> 00:58.157
     -Driving.
     -Great. What streets?

00:58.159 --> 00:59.558
      We can check
      the traffic cameras.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.069
            Oh, no.

01:12.339 --> 01:14.073
    This is
    a very serious offense.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.275
        She's in there.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.743
         What happened?

01:17.745 --> 01:19.845
   Lowell tracey, found dead
   in his apartment.

01:19.847 --> 01:22.881
 Apparent suicide,
 but neighbors heard two voices
 before the shot.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.249
   Who do they think did it?

01:26.387 --> 01:27.653
         You're joking.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.588
      She was at the scene
      when they got there.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.924
   And her alibi's not great.

01:31.926 --> 01:33.358
      If you need a break,
      i can stay.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.160
      Actually, you can't.

01:35.162 --> 01:38.330
      You need to talk
      major off the ledge.

01:38.332 --> 01:41.266
    Remember that guy
    whose car he broke into,
    julien dupont?

01:41.268 --> 01:43.335
      The one major calls
      "the candyman."
      what about him?

01:43.337 --> 01:46.738
   Major calls me saying
   he broke into your house.
   Major shot him.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.775
 Or at least he thinks he did.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.810
   When i got to your place,
   there was no body.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.078
        Not even blood.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.080
     Shell casings,
     so something happened,

01:55.082 --> 01:58.350
    But folks who get shot
    three times in the chest
    don't just walk away.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.121
     I have to go, but
     if anything happens...

02:02.123 --> 02:03.689
         I got her. Go.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.459
            (sighs)

02:07.461 --> 02:08.894
     Flynn: ...Called 911.

02:08.895 --> 02:10.461
        We're done here.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.763
     Sir, can we just have
     a minute to talk...

02:11.765 --> 02:13.866
  The gsr on mr. Tracey's hand
  is consistent

02:13.868 --> 02:16.201
  With a self-inflicted wound.

02:16.203 --> 02:17.936
       Textbook suicide.

02:17.938 --> 02:20.405
      As long as the me's
      office concurs,
      the case is closed.

02:22.176 --> 02:24.710
      You can go.
      Sorry for your loss.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.988
      (theme song playing)

02:58.579 --> 03:00.579
   It was that candyman guy!
   All right.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.881
   He broke in, he came at me
   with a sledgehammer,

03:02.883 --> 03:04.650
      Raving about brains.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.552
    If i hadn't had the gun,
    i'd be dead.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.887
  -Where did you get the gun?
  -I bought it on the street.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.190
         Oh, of course.
         As one does.

03:11.192 --> 03:13.659
  Major, you're on probation.
  An illegal firearm
  charge could...

03:13.661 --> 03:15.894
  You know when it makes sense
  to buy a gun?

03:15.896 --> 03:17.863
     When a dude
     built like a mountain

03:17.865 --> 03:20.098
     Breaks into your house
     trying to kill you.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.267
      When i shot the guy,
      his eyes turned red.

03:22.269 --> 03:24.770
     Bright red!
     What the hell is that?

03:24.772 --> 03:26.538
   My gun isn't the problem.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.407
   The problem is
   what the hell i'm gonna do

03:28.409 --> 03:30.242
   When a guy who takes
   three bullets to the chest

03:30.244 --> 03:32.811
    And moseys off like
    it's nothing comes back.

03:34.448 --> 03:38.183
   Things just keep happening
   that don't make any sense,

03:38.185 --> 03:40.285
   And it's like i'm the only
   one who sees it.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.090
     You'll be able to see
     for yourself.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.792
    All right? Clive's gonna
    sweep the hospitals.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.927
     He'll call any minute,
     all right?

03:48.929 --> 03:51.597
   He'll say he found julien,
   he saw bullet wounds,
   and that'll be that.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.432
  Actually, clive's with liv.

03:55.202 --> 03:56.902
       There's something
       you should know.

03:58.105 --> 04:00.105
      (breathing heavily)

04:03.811 --> 04:05.143
         -(shot fired)
         -(screaming)

04:06.780 --> 04:08.280
           (screams)

04:09.483 --> 04:10.749
           (gasping)

04:16.857 --> 04:17.990
              Hey.

04:18.692 --> 04:19.925
              Liv.

04:23.464 --> 04:24.863
       Why are you here?

04:29.737 --> 04:31.136
   You don't need to be here.

04:31.138 --> 04:32.604
        I need to, uh...

04:34.041 --> 04:35.240
       Come on, come on.

04:36.543 --> 04:37.876
         I need to eat.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.947
    I'm still on ptsd brain
    and i...

04:41.949 --> 04:45.484
    I tried to sleep.
    I keep seeing yesterday
    over and over.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.653
       Whatever you need,
       i'm here.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.488
      Absolutely anything.

04:51.091 --> 04:54.059
    I don't really know
    what happened yesterday.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.828
   Clive told me all he knows
   and suzuki was down here

04:56.830 --> 04:59.364
   Not an hour ago pushing
   his version of the story.

04:59.366 --> 05:02.434
  The end of which is me
  declaring lowell a suicide.

05:02.436 --> 05:05.504
 He wasn't interested
 in the fact that the evidence
 doesn't support it.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.739
      I know. It's murder.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.611
     Lowell stabbed blaine
     and blaine shot him.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.212
          -I saw it.
          -You saw it?

05:14.214 --> 05:15.747
      I don't want to talk
      about it.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.683
     God, suzuki's covering
     for him.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.453
     Blaine somehow has
     the police department
     in his pocket.

05:21.455 --> 05:24.323
 The missing kids, now lowell,
 he's making people disappear.

05:24.325 --> 05:27.459
  I just want to come to work
  like it's any day.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.294
     Today is just tuesday
     or whatever it is.

05:29.296 --> 05:31.263
         -Please, ravi?
         -Of course.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.333
          Who's that?

05:34.335 --> 05:38.804
 Um, well, this is
 rebecca hinton, 31 years old.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.939
  Journalist/raging alcoholic.

05:40.941 --> 05:44.776
 Her cerebrospinal fluid
 practically came out on
 the rocks with a lemon twist.

05:44.778 --> 05:48.146
 Apparently, she interrupted
 someone robbing her apartment.

05:48.148 --> 05:51.183
   She was found
   at the foot of her stairs
   with a broken neck.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.852
      Hinton. Did she work
      at <i> the observer?</i>

05:53.854 --> 05:55.187
       How did you know?

05:55.189 --> 05:56.655
       She's the reporter
       major worked with

05:56.657 --> 05:58.857
 When the police wouldn't help
 him find his shelter kids.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.793
   The one that wrote
   the expose that got him
   beaten to a pulp in jail?

06:02.496 --> 06:04.129
        That's the one.

06:04.131 --> 06:07.199
   Wait, you did hear me say
   she was an alcoholic?

06:07.201 --> 06:08.567
     If you eat her brain,
     chances are...

06:08.569 --> 06:10.435
   I'll end up
   at the bottom of a bottle.

06:10.437 --> 06:11.570
             Sold.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.512
         Julien dupont?

06:20.513 --> 06:22.480
 -Yeah, who's asking?
 -Clive babineaux. Seattle pd.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.349
     What can i do for you?

06:24.351 --> 06:26.418
    I have a man named
    major lilywhite claiming

06:26.420 --> 06:28.920
 You broke into his home
 and assaulted him last night.

06:28.922 --> 06:32.891
    Says he shot you
    three times in the chest
    and you fled the scene.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.060
             Major.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.496
   Blonde, pretty boy,
   looks like he fell out of
   a nicholas sparks movie?

06:37.498 --> 06:38.797
             Yeah.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.633
    Yeah. Yeah, that guy's
    pretty much my stalker.

06:41.635 --> 06:43.869
  Couple weeks ago
  he attacked me for my shoes.

06:43.871 --> 06:46.271
 And then the other day
 he broke into my friggin' car.

06:46.273 --> 06:48.807
    He was arrested,
    it should be on record.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.076
  The guy's got a screw loose.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.745
    Do i look like somebody
    who took three
    to the chest last night?

07:02.055 --> 07:03.755
     Liv, you got a second?

07:06.927 --> 07:08.627
        (phone ringing)

07:10.431 --> 07:11.930
     That's the second time
     major's called.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.432
       Can you just tell
       him i'm fine?

07:15.436 --> 07:18.069
    Or not. Didn't think
    that would be a stumper.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.839
     No, um, i'll tell him.

07:20.841 --> 07:24.109
   Look, i know avoidance is
   probably easier for you
   right now,

07:24.111 --> 07:25.977
     But there's something
     we have to deal with.

07:27.214 --> 07:30.048
  The release of body form...

07:30.050 --> 07:31.817
     I think we should say
     lowell killed himself.

07:37.257 --> 07:40.425
  The real killer is a zombie.

07:40.427 --> 07:42.627
    Anyone on blaine's trail
    will be in danger

07:42.629 --> 07:44.296
    And we can't warn them.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.698
     And if they do manage
     to catch him,

07:46.700 --> 07:49.000
  Then there's the whole
  zombie-in-a-prison problem.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.572
   And then there's the body.
   It's a biohazard,

07:53.574 --> 07:55.106
      And we don't know
      if it's contagious.

07:56.210 --> 07:58.410
 I'm sorry, i have to ask you.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.045
             Truly.

08:01.548 --> 08:04.983
    But if we say suicide,
    then the body can be...

08:05.953 --> 08:07.219
    Well, we can destroy it.

08:07.721 --> 08:08.787
            (sighs)

08:10.190 --> 08:12.290
     I won't sign this
     without your blessing.

08:18.332 --> 08:19.664
        I need a drink.

08:21.134 --> 08:24.069
        Vodka. Anything.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.404
     I'll take a glass of
     formaldehyde, just...

08:29.776 --> 08:31.076
          (screaming)

08:34.114 --> 08:35.514
          (shrieking)

08:35.515 --> 08:37.916
           (groaning)

08:37.918 --> 08:39.551
           (thudding)
           (screams)

08:41.522 --> 08:43.587
           (gasping)

08:44.825 --> 08:46.224
           Please...

08:52.933 --> 08:54.799
           (exhaling)

08:54.801 --> 08:57.402
      What's this, shrimp?

08:57.404 --> 08:58.737
      It smells fantastic.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.208
 I'm on the dead reporter case.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.610
  You're welcome to help
  if you're feeling up to it.

09:05.612 --> 09:07.712
  The robbery was a cover-up.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.681
 The killer was after something
 stored on her phone.

09:09.683 --> 09:12.083
   I saw him use rebecca's
   fingerprint to unlock it.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.351
      Yeah, i'm up to it.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.333
 I've been rebecca's editor
 ever since she was an intern.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.435
    Mind if we ask
    what she was working on?

09:30.437 --> 09:32.637
 In-depth piece on jason frye,

09:32.639 --> 09:35.240
     That degaulle college
     kid who snapped.

09:35.242 --> 09:38.009
  The library killer.
  Cracked a kid's skull open,

09:38.011 --> 09:40.912
    Chucked a girl
    through a display case.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.881
    The one-year anniversary
    is coming up...

09:42.883 --> 09:44.149
       Can we get a look
       at the story?

09:44.151 --> 09:47.452
 Well, it was due a month ago,
 so, of course not.

09:47.454 --> 09:50.755
    Rebecca always liked
    to miss her deadlines
    by at least five weeks.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.960
    I know she had a source,
    but she never told me.

09:55.562 --> 09:56.695
              Oh.

09:56.697 --> 10:00.532
    I did manage to find
    a notebook on her desk.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.200
      I'm not sure
      if it'll be any use.

10:03.870 --> 10:07.572
  It's in rebecca's shorthand,
  aka code.

10:07.574 --> 10:10.875
     She was secretive.
     Very territorial about
     her stories.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.844
     Could any of these men
     be her source?

10:12.846 --> 10:15.547
   Mr. Richmond, mr. Jackson,
   mr. Lw...

10:15.549 --> 10:17.048
         Mr... Berserk?

10:17.050 --> 10:20.285
 Sorry, no idea.
 Oh, that bit there, though...

10:20.287 --> 10:24.022
      Yeah. "ryan fisher.
      Sketchy d-bag."

10:24.024 --> 10:28.026
     If i remember right,
     fisher was a classmate
     of jason frye's.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.433
        We could just go
        door to door

10:35.435 --> 10:37.202
    Asking where
    the "sketchy d-bag" is.

10:37.204 --> 10:40.338
 Half of them are law students,
 we'd be here all day.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.906
        (elevator dings)

10:44.678 --> 10:45.944
        Can i help you?

10:45.946 --> 10:47.646
         -Ryan fisher?
         -Yeah.

10:47.648 --> 10:50.482
      Detective babineaux,
      seattle pd.

10:50.484 --> 10:53.151
 We're looking into the murder
 of rebecca hinton.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.720
       That's awful news.
       What happened?

10:55.722 --> 10:57.455
    That's what we're trying
    to find out.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.458
       Can you tell us...

11:03.597 --> 11:06.031
    Can you tell us what you
    and rebecca spoke about?

11:06.033 --> 11:07.732
       I barely met her.

11:07.734 --> 11:09.701
      She wanted to know
      the real jason frye.

11:09.703 --> 11:10.935
    Why would you know that?

11:10.937 --> 11:13.071
     I'm president
     of the debate society.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.140
     Jason was on my team,

11:15.142 --> 11:16.741
   And i made it my business
   to know all the vassals
   in my fiefdom.

11:16.743 --> 11:18.576
          (chuckling)

11:18.578 --> 11:21.846
 Sorry.
 Continue about your "fiefdom."

11:21.848 --> 11:25.884
  Jason was highly recruited.
  A hotshot, candidly.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.086
      But competition here
      is fierce,

11:28.088 --> 11:30.288
 Really the <i> ne plus ultra</i> of
 the collegiate debating world.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.626
       Look, my point is,
       for the first time

11:34.628 --> 11:36.761
        In jason's life,
        he was losing.

11:36.763 --> 11:40.298
  He spiraled.
  It's a boring story, really.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.767
   One more over-stressed,
   over-achiever who snapped.

11:42.769 --> 11:46.404
  Debate prodigy cracks,
  bashes brains of classmates.
  What a yawn.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.972
      Try not burying
      the lead next time.

11:47.974 --> 11:49.908
     Bloodshed always goes
     in the first graph.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.209
        (elevator dings)

11:51.211 --> 11:54.145
     Can you tell us about
     a mr. Jackson?

11:54.147 --> 11:55.980
           -Who?
           -Hey, you.

11:55.982 --> 11:57.315
    I'll be in in a minute.

12:02.622 --> 12:04.122
   What about a mr. Richmond?

12:05.959 --> 12:07.659
  I told you
  i'm not gonna talk about it!

12:07.661 --> 12:08.793
        Get out of here!

12:09.563 --> 12:10.995
           (exhales)

12:10.997 --> 12:13.131
      Sorry, no richmond,
      no jackson.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.367
 Will that be all, detectives?

12:20.640 --> 12:23.775
    You go on. I'm gonna
    walk home, get some air.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.578
      Sure, do your thing.

12:30.951 --> 12:34.452
     Liv: <i> Rebecca's lone-wolf</i>
    <i> policy has its benefits.</i>

12:34.454 --> 12:36.321
    <i> When i focus hard enough</i>
    <i> on the task at hand,</i>

12:36.323 --> 12:38.690
  <i> I don't have to think about</i>
  <i> anything else.</i>

12:38.692 --> 12:40.792
     <i> And if my problems are</i>
     <i> too big to forget,</i>

12:40.794 --> 12:42.694
    <i> If the task at hand</i>
    <i> isn't consuming enough,</i>

12:45.265 --> 12:47.265
<i> I just consume something else.</i>

12:48.235 --> 12:49.434
              Hey.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.607
      Did you find julien?
      Is he dead?

12:55.609 --> 12:59.310
 Yeah, i found him at the gym.
 He was benching 350.

12:59.312 --> 13:02.180
  Less than 10 hours
  after you say you put
  three bullets in his chest.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.048
     Look, i'm telling you,
     i shot him.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.753
    That him?
    It's from this morning.

13:10.056 --> 13:11.956
             No...

13:11.958 --> 13:15.393
 You need to listen right now.
 I've been in a lot of rooms
 where guns went off,

13:15.395 --> 13:17.796
     And that room doesn't
     look like any of 'em.

13:17.798 --> 13:22.033
 No bullets, no blood,
 and the man you
 say you shot didn't get shot.

13:22.035 --> 13:25.436
  What you're saying happened
  didn't happen.

13:25.438 --> 13:28.673
   And if you believe it did,
   you got a problem.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.051
      You heard of a 220?

13:42.088 --> 13:45.356
     Involuntary commitment
     to a psych facility.

13:45.358 --> 13:50.094
   We use them when behavior
   is erratic, dangerous,
   and escalating

13:50.096 --> 13:51.729
  And you're three for three.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.432
           Hear this.

13:55.402 --> 13:56.601
           Get help.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.770
              Now.

13:58.772 --> 14:00.438
        Before someone
        gets it for you.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.508
  You need me to call someone?

14:08.014 --> 14:09.881
   Thanks for being straight
   with me.

14:12.619 --> 14:13.852
  Take care of yourself, man.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.089
         (door opening)

14:30.871 --> 14:32.604
  He's not the cuddling type.

14:32.606 --> 14:34.739
            Shocker.

14:34.741 --> 14:38.476
   Look, i know you probably
   want to grab some shut-eye
   before you gotta

14:38.478 --> 14:41.679
    Wipe down menus
    and marry ketchups,
    but i gotta talk to you.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.314
           Screw you.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.049
  If a guy lets you walk home
  at 3:00 am

14:45.051 --> 14:46.351
       With your panties
       in your purse,

14:46.353 --> 14:48.486
   You're not his girlfriend.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.489
   The guy you thought was
   your meal ticket is really
   just a bang buddy.

14:51.491 --> 14:55.526
    But cute townies always
    get screwed. Literally.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.528
       Wait, i was gonna
       ask you something.

14:57.530 --> 15:00.765
  Oh! There's a reporter at
  <i> the observer</i> you talked to,
  rebecca hinton.

15:00.767 --> 15:03.368
   No, i didn't. And i'm not
   talking to you either.

15:03.370 --> 15:06.170
    I am a medical examiner
    from the seattle pd.

15:06.172 --> 15:08.239
     Like i frickin' care.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.942
  And you can tell that bitch
  rebecca to kiss my ass
  for talking to my parents.

15:10.944 --> 15:13.878
    She's not really kissing
    much ass right now,
    she's dead.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.859
      -Can i interest you
      in a coffee?
      -I'm good.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.361
       You're leaving me?

15:31.765 --> 15:33.564
        What's his name?

15:33.566 --> 15:36.134
      It's not important.
      Just know that what
       we had was real.

15:37.837 --> 15:42.440
     Actually, i talked to
     my supervisor
     at helton shelter.

15:42.442 --> 15:46.611
    She referred me to a guy
    who specializes
    in psychotic disorders.

15:46.613 --> 15:50.515
 He thinks i'm a good candidate
 for blooming grove.

15:50.517 --> 15:54.285
  You're not checking yourself
  into a mental hospital,
  you're not crazy.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.354
       You've been under
       enormous stress.

15:56.356 --> 15:57.989
     You just need to get
     away, go on vacation.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.724
    Ravi, i'm seeing things.

15:59.726 --> 16:02.460
      I'd swear on a stack
      of bibles that guy
      julien was here.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.696
 I'd swear his eyes turned red,
 that i shot him.

16:04.698 --> 16:07.632
    If someone at my psych
    internship told me that,
    and there was a picture

16:07.634 --> 16:10.735
     Of that guy at the gym
     the next day,
     there's no question.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.204
    It's delusional disorder
    with paranoid features.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.273
       You can't fix that
       with a vacation.

16:16.710 --> 16:18.443
     I don't have a choice.

16:22.949 --> 16:24.549
      (cell phone ringing
      and vibrating)

16:29.356 --> 16:30.688
        (ringing stops)

16:46.039 --> 16:47.305
         Hey, pre-hab.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.944
    I'll tell you everything
    you need to know,
    but i need immunity.

17:01.955 --> 17:05.790
Liv: <i> Sounds like</i>
<i> your boyfriend ryan had issues</i>
<i> with jason before he snapped.</i>

17:05.791 --> 17:08.291
   Jason was showing ryan up
   on the debate team.

17:08.294 --> 17:12.964
   So, ryan and the guys took
   jason to this cabin
   for a weekend.

17:12.965 --> 17:15.400
      They fed him jager
      till he passed out,

17:15.402 --> 17:19.037
   Then they put makeup on me
   to make it look like i was
     all bruised and bloody.

17:19.039 --> 17:23.641
 I got in bed next to the kid,
 and, like, pretended to
 be dead, i guess.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.009
     You guess or you know?

17:25.011 --> 17:26.109
            I know.

17:26.112 --> 17:28.112
   Then ryan shook him awake

17:28.114 --> 17:31.115
     And the guys played it
     like jason blacked out
         and killed me.

17:31.117 --> 17:34.018
      Jason was freaking,
      but ryan told him

17:34.020 --> 17:36.821
     They were his brothers
     and they'd handle it.

17:36.823 --> 17:39.924
     So they rolled me up
     in a sheet and put me
       in ryan's trunk.

17:39.926 --> 17:43.161
   Jason was, like, sobbing.

17:43.163 --> 17:46.564
  Then a couple of days later,
  he went psycho.

17:46.566 --> 17:50.101
  Ryan said if anyone snitched
  we'd all go to jail.

17:50.103 --> 17:52.870
  So we kept our mouths shut,
  until that rebecca chick

17:52.872 --> 17:55.740
 Got all up in ryan's business
 and he freaked.

17:55.742 --> 17:59.944
     Do i think he'd murder
     someone to protect
     his big law career?

17:59.946 --> 18:01.379
           Hell yes.

18:01.381 --> 18:04.315
     Wait, go back.
     Does jason still think
     he killed you?

18:07.620 --> 18:09.987
    I'm detective babineaux.
    I'd like to talk to you.

18:09.989 --> 18:11.155
             Okay?

18:16.096 --> 18:19.430
    Son, i need
    your undivided attention
    for a minute.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.500
    -It's about connie roy.
    -Liv: Yeah. Connie roy.

18:22.502 --> 18:25.036
     The girl you killed
     on the guys' weekend
     with the debate boys?

18:25.038 --> 18:26.437
          She's alive.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.638
          She's alive?

18:27.640 --> 18:28.906
        Alive and well.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.441
      I don't understand.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.978
 You were the victim of a prank
 planned by ryan fisher.

18:33.980 --> 18:36.214
  He thought you were too big
  for your britches,
  so they got you drunk

18:36.216 --> 18:38.249
      And made you think
      you killed the girl.

18:38.251 --> 18:39.550
     They wouldn't do that.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.586
   They would, and they did.

18:41.588 --> 18:44.188
 Connie's a hook-up of ryan's.
 She confessed.

18:45.091 --> 18:47.625
              Oh.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.461
   I'm sorry, but i need
   to ask you some questions.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.564
  A reporter, rebecca hinton,
  was murdered.

18:53.566 --> 18:56.868
 We think ryan may have done it
 to keep her from writing
 a story about this.

18:56.870 --> 18:58.236
      Did rebecca ask you
      about this?

18:58.238 --> 19:00.271
          -About ryan?
          -No.

19:00.273 --> 19:01.706
  She said he seemed sketchy.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.510
       I vouched for him.

19:05.512 --> 19:08.146
 Did she ever mention
 mr. Jackson or a mr. Richmond?

19:14.354 --> 19:16.454
     That's from my dorm's
     halloween party.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.156
 What's with the max rager guy?

19:18.158 --> 19:20.424
       He was going as me
       for halloween.

19:20.426 --> 19:22.593
      I was kind of
      a max rager addict.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.197
        Or i used to be.

19:32.438 --> 19:36.574
   Mr. Richmond, mr. Jackson,
   mr. Lw, mr. Berserk...

19:36.576 --> 19:40.411
   What if it's not "mister"?
   What if mr stands for
   max rager?

19:40.413 --> 19:42.613
       Oh. It's possible.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.849
  We'll look into it after
  we get ryan fisher's alibi.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.185
  Remember the memo
  carson mccomb told us about?

19:47.187 --> 19:50.454
 Max rager knew their drink
 could cause violent psychotic
 breaks in people.

19:50.456 --> 19:52.023
         "mr. Berserk"!

19:52.025 --> 19:54.025
       This could be
       why jason snapped!

19:54.027 --> 19:56.527
      If they knew rebecca
      was looking into it,
        goodbye, rebecca.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.563
   -It's a good theory.
   -It's more than a theory.

19:58.565 --> 20:02.900
  It's not. It's a hunch
  you have that may or may not
  be right, aka a theory.

20:02.902 --> 20:06.103
  Ryan fisher is a theory too,
  but one with a witness.

20:06.105 --> 20:10.841
  So we'll go through our list
  in an organized way and
  don't run off half-cocked.

20:10.843 --> 20:13.277
   Especially when we've got
   heavy things going on
   in our lives.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.134
       Good, you're here.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.705
        We have to talk.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.106
       I can't deal
       with the form yet,
       i need another...

20:42.108 --> 20:43.474
     We have to tell major.

20:44.177 --> 20:45.910
        Tell major what?

20:45.912 --> 20:47.845
  About zombies, about blaine,

20:47.847 --> 20:50.648
        The meal plan,
        you, everything!

20:50.650 --> 20:52.717
  I can't have
  this conversation right now.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.685
     I'm sorry, we have to.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.822
     Okay. Absolutely not.
     There, done.

20:57.824 --> 21:01.058
       The candyman tried
       to kill him.

21:01.060 --> 21:04.528
    He didn't get scratched,
    but he could've died.
    We have to tell him.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.530
     And how does that go?

21:06.532 --> 21:10.534
  Hey, major, wacky news,
  zombies exist and
  they're trying to kill you.

21:10.536 --> 21:13.271
       Not me, though,
       i'm a nice zombie.

21:13.273 --> 21:15.406
     He's checking himself
     into blooming grove.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.176
      The mental hospital?

21:19.178 --> 21:21.646
      He's being chased
      by homicidal zombies

21:21.648 --> 21:24.448
   And when he's asked
   for our help,
   we've told him he's nuts.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.984
      Of course he thinks
      he's mental.

21:26.986 --> 21:30.621
  This is on us.
  I mean, at what point
  is it not worse telling him

21:30.623 --> 21:31.922
    Than just being honest?

21:33.493 --> 21:34.959
       He's lost his job.

21:36.062 --> 21:39.664
    He's breaking into cars,
    he's shooting people.

21:39.666 --> 21:43.901
  He's doing all this
  when he thinks the candyman
  is killing kids.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.604
 What's his move when he finds
 out he's eating them?

21:48.975 --> 21:52.443
       When's he checking
       himself in?

21:52.445 --> 21:56.213
   Tomorrow morning
   for a few weeks, he said.
   It's all he can afford.

21:56.215 --> 21:58.082
  Well then, for a few weeks,
  he's safe.

22:00.053 --> 22:01.852
   (slow rock ballad playing)

22:04.557 --> 22:05.623
            (sighs)

22:08.695 --> 22:10.394
       -Can i buy you...
       -Yes.

22:10.396 --> 22:12.463
       -So what's your...
       -No.

22:25.011 --> 22:26.344
          (chuckling)

22:37.457 --> 22:41.359
      Miss, you're donezo.
      Who am i calling
      to come get you?

22:50.303 --> 22:51.435
              Hey.

22:52.772 --> 22:54.138
     You ready to go home?

23:09.455 --> 23:10.688
          Good night.

23:12.759 --> 23:14.825
     I'm so sorry about...

23:14.827 --> 23:16.927
             Don't.

23:16.929 --> 23:19.196
   Please, i'm trying so hard
   to stay afloat,

23:19.198 --> 23:21.132
   And if you say his name...

23:21.134 --> 23:23.801
        Okay. It's okay.

23:26.539 --> 23:27.705
             Wait.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.075
      Can you rub my back
      like you used to?

23:41.621 --> 23:43.220
     Ravi told me about...

23:44.357 --> 23:46.157
      That you're checking
      yourself into...

23:46.159 --> 23:48.626
        We can not talk
        about this, too.

23:50.396 --> 23:51.695
        But you're okay?

23:53.099 --> 23:55.366
       It's no big deal.

23:55.368 --> 23:58.235
      My pr guy's
      telling the tabloids
      it's "exhaustion."

23:58.237 --> 23:59.603
     I'll be doing <i> the view</i>
     when i get back.

23:59.605 --> 24:00.671
           (chuckles)

24:01.908 --> 24:04.842
       I'll be fine.
       It's not for long.

24:07.747 --> 24:09.747
    I'm just sorry that when
    you need me the most,

24:09.749 --> 24:11.482
        I lose my mind.

24:11.484 --> 24:13.250
    I screwed everything up.

24:15.388 --> 24:17.588
      I wanna explain,
      i wanna tell you...

24:17.590 --> 24:20.424
      No, liv. It's okay.

24:37.710 --> 24:38.776
             Major?

24:48.321 --> 24:49.720
       How's zombie rat?

24:51.624 --> 24:54.024
      He's living it up
      while i deliberate.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.693
     I've only one dose of
     tainted utopium left,

24:55.695 --> 24:58.095
    So this is my last shot
    at cracking zombiism.

24:59.465 --> 25:02.533
     I taught him a trick.

25:02.535 --> 25:05.603
 See, when i raise my hand like
 so and say, "prance, zombie,"

25:05.605 --> 25:09.707
    He sort of rears up
    on his little hind legs
    and prances about.

25:10.243 --> 25:11.642
            Really?

25:11.644 --> 25:15.045
Yeah. I also taught him
to declaim <i> hamlet</i> soliloquies.

25:15.047 --> 25:17.348
     He holds a tiny skull,
     it's quite something.

25:17.350 --> 25:19.450
 -We're doing <i> fallon</i> tomorrow.
 -Shut up.

25:20.753 --> 25:23.420
 So, i talked to
 sketchy d-bag and his lawyer.

25:23.422 --> 25:25.155
    Turns out he was
    at the debate tournament

25:25.157 --> 25:26.991
      At the time
      of rebecca's murder.

25:26.993 --> 25:29.793
    But i've got something
    on the max rager front.

25:29.795 --> 25:31.862
    I've been digging in
    rebecca's phone records.

25:31.864 --> 25:35.866
 Jackson and richmond
 aren't people. They're cities.

25:35.868 --> 25:39.537
  Richmond was a woman
  whose daughter was doing
  a double at a burger joint,

25:39.539 --> 25:42.873
 When she threw fry oil all
 over some loudmouth customers.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.508
    No history of violence.
    She just lost it.

25:44.510 --> 25:46.010
          Like jason.

25:46.012 --> 25:48.612
   Rebecca asked mom if
   fry girl drank max rager.

25:48.614 --> 25:50.848
      She did. Tons of it.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.650
       So, i checked out
       who was in jackson

25:52.652 --> 25:55.486
   For a violent,
   out-of-character rage out,

25:55.488 --> 25:57.254
    And found
    a mild-mannered trucker

25:57.256 --> 26:00.224
    Who mowed down
    half a charity bike race
    with his 18-wheeler.

26:00.226 --> 26:04.061
     Guess what he'd been
     drinking to stay awake
     on his long haul?

26:04.063 --> 26:08.799
  Mr. Jackson and mr. Richmond
  both went mr. Berserk.

26:08.801 --> 26:11.235
   You know, if this got out,
   it could sink max rager.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.170
     And if rebecca got her
     hands on that memo...

26:13.172 --> 26:16.874
  The one piece i don't get is
  mrlw.

26:16.876 --> 26:18.075
            I know.

26:18.945 --> 26:20.611
        Lake washington.

26:20.613 --> 26:23.547
  The boat party was sponsored
  by max rager.

26:23.549 --> 26:25.749
 I thought that was a drunken
 brawl that got out of control.

26:25.751 --> 26:27.017
      Most of the victims
      died in the fire.

26:27.019 --> 26:29.086
        No, i was there.

26:29.088 --> 26:31.855
     People were tearing
     each other to pieces.

26:31.857 --> 26:33.991
  They knew this could happen
  and they did nothing.

26:33.993 --> 26:35.359
      Liv, i had no idea.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.861
      They killed rebecca.
      They killed holly.

26:37.863 --> 26:39.363
  We gotta get these bastards.

26:39.365 --> 26:42.733
    We do, but this is
    a billion-dollar company
    and we have to be smart.

26:42.735 --> 26:45.569
    We have no evidence.
    We need to build a case.

26:45.571 --> 26:47.171
       Preferably before
       they murder us.

26:48.874 --> 26:50.941
    I'll take this upstairs.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.176
        You hang tight.

26:53.412 --> 26:54.612
           We clear?

27:01.854 --> 27:04.154
       (speaking italian)

27:06.392 --> 27:08.459
       (speaking italian)

27:10.963 --> 27:13.330
 I'm liv moore with seattle pd.
 I need to speak with you.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.399
       (speaking italian)

27:19.372 --> 27:20.537
    Have a seat, ms. Moore.

27:20.539 --> 27:21.939
   I'm just fine right here.

27:21.941 --> 27:24.308
   I'm so sorry.
   She wouldn't listen to me.

27:24.310 --> 27:27.678
  I stood in front of the door
  and she just came at me.

27:27.680 --> 27:30.781
    I'm so embarrassed.
    Next time, i won't move.
    I'll just take the hit.

27:30.783 --> 27:33.150
     It's okay, it's okay.
     You did beautifully,
        you really did.

27:33.152 --> 27:36.620
   Now just relax.
   Close your eyes, breathe.

27:36.622 --> 27:38.122
     Breathe, that's right.

27:38.124 --> 27:40.357
   Say it with me.
   I did everything i could.

27:40.359 --> 27:42.159
   I did everything i could.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.794
     And set yourself free.

27:43.796 --> 27:44.995
            Better?

27:44.997 --> 27:46.363
           (exhaling)

27:50.269 --> 27:51.335
          (chuckling)

27:52.438 --> 27:54.672
     Unusual entrance
     for a police officer.

27:54.674 --> 27:57.608
 We've been investigating
 the murder of rebecca hinton,

27:57.610 --> 28:01.545
  A journalist at <i> the observer</i>
  who was working on a story
  you might be interested in.

28:01.547 --> 28:05.015
   She had evidence that
   the energy drink max rager

28:05.017 --> 28:08.052
  Was causing temporary
  psychosis in a small number
  of consumers.

28:08.054 --> 28:10.187
     And that small number
     of consumers

28:10.189 --> 28:12.389
     Has now racked up
     quite the body count.

28:12.391 --> 28:17.795
   I was at lake washington.
   I saw firsthand
   what that looks like.

28:17.797 --> 28:22.933
   But the incidents you've
   described can be linked to
   many variables, i'm sure.

28:22.935 --> 28:27.004
     Was there booze?
     Could that have been
     a common denominator?

28:27.006 --> 28:29.373
    Could the moon
    have been full, perhaps?

28:29.375 --> 28:31.742
    We know about the memo.

28:31.744 --> 28:33.844
   Your r&d team warned you,

28:33.846 --> 28:37.081
 And you deemed the side effect
 statistically insignificant.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.549
         You buried it.

28:38.551 --> 28:42.019
   The memo does exist, yes.
   But it's a phony.

28:42.021 --> 28:44.521
       It was created
       by my competitors.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.056
         (door opening)

28:46.058 --> 28:47.658
   I checked with seattle pd.

28:47.660 --> 28:49.393
       She's an assistant
       medical examiner.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.428
    She shouldn't be asking
    you questions.

28:51.430 --> 28:54.331
 Ms. Moore, you are a delight.

28:54.333 --> 28:57.401
    I hope our conversation,
    brief though it was,

28:57.403 --> 29:00.003
      Mitigated at least
      some of your fears.

29:00.005 --> 29:02.339
   Your product kills people
   and you know it.

29:03.309 --> 29:05.476
  Live to the max, ms. Moore!

29:07.680 --> 29:09.646
   Just do it somewhere else.

29:16.922 --> 29:19.356
    I specifically told you
    not to go.

29:19.358 --> 29:21.558
  All i did was ask questions.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.660
         -You're drunk.
         -You're drunk.

29:23.662 --> 29:28.098
 You know, i smelled it on you
 before, and that's on me
 for not saying anything,

29:28.100 --> 29:30.768
  But you came back too soon.

29:30.770 --> 29:33.103
   You know, i feel for you,
   but this isn't helping.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.972
        If i were drunk
        could i do this?

29:37.343 --> 29:39.042
   Probably, but not as well.

29:40.312 --> 29:41.779
   Liv, you're off the case.

29:41.781 --> 29:44.715
    I'm never off the case.
    The case is in here.

29:44.717 --> 29:47.084
    I'm the freakin' murder
    victim whisperer.

29:47.086 --> 29:48.285
            Go home.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.053
      You're literally
      not the boss of me.

29:50.055 --> 29:53.390
     But i am, and i think
     you probably should.

30:05.070 --> 30:06.270
           Mr. Vodka.

30:08.874 --> 30:11.742
  Sorry, did i forget ordering
  a glass of poison?

30:11.744 --> 30:12.976
      It's from that guy.

30:20.352 --> 30:24.087
     Sebastian meyer.
     I'm rebecca's source.

30:24.089 --> 30:25.923
      You gotta help
      or they'll kill me.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.336
    When i hadn't heard
    from rebecca in a week,

30:39.338 --> 30:41.271
    I knew they smoked her.

30:41.273 --> 30:43.040
  I got a hold of her editor,
  he confirmed.

30:43.042 --> 30:44.808
     He's the one
     that put me on to you.

30:44.810 --> 30:48.011
 Said you were looking
 into the story, so
 i thought i'd give it a shot.

30:48.013 --> 30:49.713
     How are you connected
     to vaughn?

30:49.715 --> 30:51.448
     I was on the payroll.

30:51.450 --> 30:55.185
 For a while, it was all rides
 in the g5, steak dinner,
 steak dinner.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.888
     We were family,
     knew all each other's
     dirty little secrets.

30:57.890 --> 30:59.356
   I was even his body guard
   for a few minutes.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.457
         What happened?

31:00.459 --> 31:02.793
   I stopped being his bitch.

31:02.795 --> 31:04.494
   When you work for a freak
   like vaughn,

31:04.496 --> 31:06.964
   You're asked to do things
   that turn your stomach.

31:06.966 --> 31:09.666
    But you don't say no,
    the scratch is too good.

31:09.668 --> 31:12.002
        The life...
        Mmm, the women.

31:12.004 --> 31:15.172
  There was this girl i had
  my eye on, eliza marquette.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.709
        I was this close
        to nailing her.

31:18.711 --> 31:21.278
    Frosty, but i loved it.

31:21.280 --> 31:25.616
   She was taking heat for a
   bad leak, and then poof...
   Disappeared.

31:25.618 --> 31:27.351
        I know all about
        eliza marquette.

31:27.353 --> 31:28.785
  She was protecting the memo.

31:28.787 --> 31:29.920
       You need to get
       your hands on it.

31:29.922 --> 31:31.922
     It'll bring max rager
     to its knees.

31:31.924 --> 31:33.357
   But vaughn admits
   it's out there.
   He says that it's a fake.

31:33.359 --> 31:34.591
       He's a lying sack.

31:34.593 --> 31:35.993
     Rebecca's other source
     says that it's real.

31:35.995 --> 31:37.261
    There's another source?

31:37.263 --> 31:39.062
      Still on the inside.
      Someone close.

31:39.064 --> 31:41.064
    We have to get to him
    and that document, fast.

31:41.066 --> 31:43.433
  Before we end up shot and
  buried in a hole somewhere.

31:46.639 --> 31:49.273
    Sebastian says
    there's a second source,

31:49.275 --> 31:50.807
      But who is rebecca's
      second source?

31:50.809 --> 31:52.542
  Why can't i figure this out?

31:52.544 --> 31:53.944
     You'd think
     with all the drinking

31:53.946 --> 31:56.580
   You'd be incredibly sharp.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.715
    Maybe she keeps
    all the top-secret stuff
    in her head.

31:58.717 --> 32:00.250
 Max rager's a dangerous bunch,

32:00.252 --> 32:01.985
    Best not to leave clues
    lying around.

32:01.987 --> 32:03.287
        I don't buy it.

32:03.289 --> 32:05.422
       She was obsessive
       about her notes.

32:05.424 --> 32:08.792
  Her calendar has everything
  from when she'd drink to
  when she'd hit pilates.

32:10.496 --> 32:13.130
    Did rebecca's liver seem
    like the pilates type?

32:13.132 --> 32:15.799
    If you get late-stage
    cirrhosis from pilates.

32:15.801 --> 32:18.835
     She has her whole
     pilates class schedule
     scribbled in here.

32:18.837 --> 32:20.470
         All pre-dawn.

32:20.472 --> 32:22.773
  I haven't been an alcoholic
  that long,

32:22.775 --> 32:26.476
    But i can tell you that
    the only day i woke up
        before 10:00 am

32:26.478 --> 32:28.912
     Was when peyton needed
     to use the toilet
     i was passed out on.

32:28.914 --> 32:31.081
     Thank you
     for the mental image.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.649
 I totally have to go, don't i?

32:36.956 --> 32:38.222
             Blarg!

32:38.223 --> 32:39.489
     Ravi: <i> How will you know</i>
    <i> who you're looking for?</i>

32:39.491 --> 32:41.425
 Liv: <i> Maybe one of them will be</i>
<i> working out in her</i>

32:41.427 --> 32:44.861
  <i> "i'm a disgruntled</i>
  <i> max rager employee" t-shirt.</i>

32:44.863 --> 32:46.763
      <i> I don't know.</i>
      <i> I need to get lucky.</i>

32:50.102 --> 32:52.135
  I'll save you the time. No.

32:52.137 --> 32:54.438
 They know rebecca had a source
 who has the memo.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.006
    It took me less
    than a week to find you.

32:56.008 --> 32:57.240
     How long do you think
     it'll take them?

32:57.242 --> 32:59.376
     If i go public,
     exactly zero minutes.

32:59.378 --> 33:01.378
       I can protect you.

33:01.380 --> 33:04.848
  You? You barged into
  american psycho's office
  posing as a police officer.

33:04.850 --> 33:06.750
        Thanks, but no.

33:06.752 --> 33:09.820
  Rebecca found three
  separate cases of
  max rager-induced violence.

33:09.822 --> 33:11.388
  A dozen dead, more injured.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.490
     This isn't my problem.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.926
  Oh, if you believed that
  you wouldn't have been brave
  enough to swipe that memo.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.195
    We can go to the police
    right now.

33:18.197 --> 33:19.730
     Once the story's out,
     you're safe.

33:21.133 --> 33:23.100
 -You'll be able to protect me?
 -Yes.

33:25.604 --> 33:28.305
        Okay. I'm game.

33:28.307 --> 33:30.674
   Just let me go and change.

33:59.171 --> 34:00.370
             Adele?

34:02.374 --> 34:03.573
             Adele?

34:06.645 --> 34:08.344
             Adele?

34:08.347 --> 34:09.545
         Are you okay?

34:12.751 --> 34:14.217
    You look a little pale.

34:33.539 --> 34:35.839
      (sebastian humming)

34:38.710 --> 34:41.945
 Well, look who takes a lickin'
 and keeps on tickin'.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.853
   Thanks for smoking out
   our whistleblower for us.

34:50.856 --> 34:52.922
   I swear you had no pulse.

34:54.893 --> 34:59.629
    But i'm glad you're up.
    I never get to chat
    while i'm on the job.

34:59.631 --> 35:01.898
      For obvious reasons.
      (laughing)

35:04.937 --> 35:06.369
             Bingo!

35:06.371 --> 35:09.239
    I work with some pretty
    murderous cats.

35:09.241 --> 35:12.175
  Boss would want me
  to destroy this flash drive,

35:12.177 --> 35:14.044
     But it's got the memo.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.913
    And the memo's leverage.

35:16.915 --> 35:18.849
  So, i gotta keep it, right?

35:18.851 --> 35:21.852
  (chuckling)
  yeah. Yeah, i gotta keep it.

35:28.060 --> 35:29.526
           (laughing)

35:31.096 --> 35:34.231
     See ya,
     wouldn't wanna be ya.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.218
         There you are.

35:56.455 --> 35:57.787
              Hi.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.333
              Man.

36:10.335 --> 36:12.135
      I cracked you good.

36:14.139 --> 36:16.239
     So sorry, sweetheart.

36:16.241 --> 36:20.877
    Adele really screwed you
    here, big time.

36:20.879 --> 36:23.880
   That selfish bitch was
   blackmailing the company.

36:23.882 --> 36:25.749
    She was never gonna give
    you the flash drive.

36:29.221 --> 36:30.921
     And now, here you are.

36:31.957 --> 36:34.424
  Off to bed in the deep blue.

36:39.031 --> 36:41.531
       Don't be afraid,
       the water's quick.

36:42.434 --> 36:44.367
           (grunting)

36:45.404 --> 36:49.105
     Ow, mother of dragons!
     God, that hurt.

36:49.107 --> 36:51.508
     Okay, we had
     a nice moment, but...

37:10.362 --> 37:11.494
        (motor starting)

37:11.496 --> 37:12.729
            Come on!

37:19.738 --> 37:21.438
           (groaning)

37:35.621 --> 37:39.489
    Ravi: <i> So, sebastian,</i>
    <i> this max rager enforcer,</i>
    <i> he's dead?</i>

37:39.491 --> 37:40.924
       Liv: <i> I assume so.</i>

37:40.926 --> 37:43.293
  <i> Poetic, actually.</i>
  <i> He's down there with adele.</i>

37:43.295 --> 37:46.896
  <i> And i wouldn't be surprised</i>
  <i> if the police divers find</i>
  <i> eliza marquette, too.</i>

37:46.898 --> 37:48.598
   Ravi: <i> How are you feeling?</i>

37:48.600 --> 37:50.300
         Liv: <i> Hungover.</i>

37:52.504 --> 37:53.703
  What am i doing with these?

37:53.705 --> 37:54.971
   Getting those away from me.

37:57.009 --> 37:59.342
     Sign it. You're right.
     It's for the best.

38:01.546 --> 38:02.712
          You're sure?

38:06.685 --> 38:07.884
    There's something else.

38:09.121 --> 38:10.854
       I didn't tell you
       the whole story.

38:12.391 --> 38:14.257
     Lowell and blaine
     were together because

38:14.993 --> 38:17.227
        We set them up.

38:17.229 --> 38:18.962
       Lowell lured him
       onto the balcony,

38:18.964 --> 38:21.064
      And i was waiting
      across the street
      with a sniper rifle.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.067
         But i choked.

38:25.437 --> 38:27.704
       I couldn't do it.

38:27.706 --> 38:31.174
    And because i couldn't,
    lowell stepped up,
    and it got him killed.

38:32.878 --> 38:34.177
    It's my fault he's dead.

38:37.783 --> 38:39.049
           Oh, liv...

38:52.798 --> 38:54.297
    It was like a nightmare.

38:55.133 --> 38:56.933
 The guy, he just kept coming.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.070
    And when i shot him,
    his eyes, they turned...

39:03.909 --> 39:05.075
       It doesn't matter.

39:06.511 --> 39:09.512
    It wasn't real.
    And that's why i'm here.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.648
    Thank you for sharing
    your experience with us.

39:11.650 --> 39:15.485
   Does anyone have feedback
   or anything they'd like
   to say to major?

39:15.487 --> 39:18.421
  Okay, guys.
  Fold the chairs,
  put 'em up against the wall,

39:18.423 --> 39:20.090
     And we meet again
     monday, eight o'clock.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.126
              Pm.

39:25.464 --> 39:27.063
           Hey, man.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.631
   I know
   what you're dealing with.

39:30.001 --> 39:31.868
      I've seen guys
      like your candyman.

39:32.671 --> 39:34.437
        Oh, thanks, man.

39:34.439 --> 39:36.506
         Scotty, is it?

39:36.508 --> 39:40.710
   I'm scott e.
   It's not e, like as in y,
   but it's e, like as in e.

39:40.712 --> 39:41.845
           Separate.

39:41.847 --> 39:43.346
             Right.

39:43.348 --> 39:46.316
    I almost didn't make it
    out alive that night.

39:46.318 --> 39:47.684
      You know, they were
      crazy-ass strong

39:47.686 --> 39:49.152
  And i still have nightmares
  about those eyes.

39:49.154 --> 39:51.488
     They're red, glowing.

39:53.892 --> 39:56.259
 You know what they are, right?

39:56.261 --> 39:57.527
         What are they?

39:58.630 --> 40:00.463
         Zombies, dude.

40:00.465 --> 40:01.765
       Friggin' zombies.

40:01.767 --> 40:04.100
       This city has
       a zombie problem.

40:13.845 --> 40:15.645
           (sobbing)

40:44.910 --> 40:47.444
     I'm gonna find blaine.

40:47.446 --> 40:49.546
      And next time,
      i'll be able to pull
      the trigger.
