[jingling]

13:49.530 --> 13:51.464
[chuckling]

13:52.633 --> 13:54.568
[jingling]

14:04.578 --> 14:06.179
An F?

14:08.949 --> 14:11.552
I'm sorry, Balki, but there were
some fundamental mistakes.

14:11.585 --> 14:14.154
Now, I know
you're a little disappointed.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.659
But...look at this
as a growth experience.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.260
I'm gonna get taller from this?

14:20.293 --> 14:21.194
No.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.932
No, I mean..

14:25.966 --> 14:29.302
...one can often learn more
from failure than from success.

14:29.335 --> 14:31.104
Can I learn
a little less and get a C?

14:31.137 --> 14:32.038
No.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.675
No.

14:34.708 --> 14:38.344
Balki, I know I set
my grading standards high.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.481
But I expect a lot
from my students.

14:41.515 --> 14:44.117
Now, if you work really hard..

14:44.150 --> 14:47.253
...someday you'll get a paper
back from me with an A on it

14:47.287 --> 14:49.022
and it will
really mean something.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.026
Well, that's
something to shoot for.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.597
That's the spirit.

14:56.630 --> 14:58.231
Goodnight, buddy.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.367
[instrumental music]

15:05.539 --> 15:08.041
[instrumental music]

15:12.278 --> 15:13.947
(Larry)
'Keep that in mind
when you are writing.'

15:13.980 --> 15:16.950
Remember, when you
organize those long

15:16.983 --> 15:20.053
complicated sentences, try..

15:20.086 --> 15:21.321
...a semi‐colon.

15:24.625 --> 15:26.492
It may be just what you need..

15:26.527 --> 15:27.928
...to save your story.

15:34.467 --> 15:37.704
Now, before we run out of time..

15:37.738 --> 15:39.640
...Balki, could you
give me a hand

15:39.673 --> 15:41.542
handing back
the news story assignments?

15:43.143 --> 15:44.044
Balki?

15:46.046 --> 15:47.648
But, cousin..

15:47.681 --> 15:50.050
...as an F student
I'm not qualified

15:50.083 --> 15:51.685
to pass out papers.

15:51.718 --> 15:54.287
Balki, you are not an F student.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.289
‐ I'm not?
‐ You're a good student..

15:56.322 --> 15:57.724
...who did F work.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.562
You gonna pass out the papers

16:01.595 --> 16:03.396
or are we gonna grow
old together?

16:08.068 --> 16:13.173
Now, I did see a lot
of potential in these papers

16:13.206 --> 16:16.710
but there's also
a lot of room for improvement.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.478
Hey, wait a minute.
This looks like an F.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.015
It is an F.

16:22.048 --> 16:23.584
But maybe with some hard work

16:23.617 --> 16:25.519
your next assignment can be a D.

16:27.588 --> 16:29.222
Hey, I got an F too.

16:29.255 --> 16:32.759
‐ Oh, man!
‐ Dipstick.

16:32.793 --> 16:34.761
[all grumbling]

16:34.795 --> 16:36.530
Now, now. Hey, remember‐‐

16:36.563 --> 16:37.664
Jerk.

16:40.166 --> 16:43.036
One can often learn more
from failure than from success.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.607
Who is this guy?
Mr. Rogers?

16:48.542 --> 16:51.277
I have never
gotten an F in my life!

16:51.311 --> 16:52.813
You failed all of us?

16:52.846 --> 16:55.115
And this from a guy
who works in a basement!

16:55.148 --> 16:56.683
[indistinct chatter]

16:58.852 --> 17:01.655
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

17:03.289 --> 17:05.559
I know this first assignment
was tough

17:05.592 --> 17:09.128
but this is all aimed
at making you good journalists.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.765
Who wants to be a journalist?
I wanna be a linebacker!

17:11.798 --> 17:13.534
[bell ringing]

17:16.169 --> 17:17.704
[indistinct chatter]

17:28.414 --> 17:30.150
I wonder what got into them?

17:31.718 --> 17:33.654
You failed the entire class?

17:35.288 --> 17:38.592
Well, Balki, I told you
I set my standards high.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.528
Your‐your standards are so high

17:41.562 --> 17:44.164
I can't even see them from here!

17:44.197 --> 17:47.333
Now, Balki, my standards
are not that high!

17:47.367 --> 17:49.603
I‐if I want to bring out
the best in my students

17:49.636 --> 17:50.871
they're‐they're just gonna
have to learn

17:50.904 --> 17:52.606
from their mistakes.
Like you did.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.174
What are you talking about?

17:54.207 --> 17:55.642
Well, I read
your second attempt at a story

17:55.676 --> 17:57.511
and believe me,
you improved!

17:57.544 --> 18:00.413
What? I...what second
attempt at a story?

18:00.446 --> 18:01.548
Look, I know
you were embarrassed

18:01.582 --> 18:03.316
to show it to me after the F

18:03.349 --> 18:05.886
but I saw your story on the
kitchen table this morning

18:05.919 --> 18:08.655
so I thought
I'd help you out and grade it.

18:08.689 --> 18:10.657
Oh, cousin, this isn't my story.

18:10.691 --> 18:13.393
This is, uh,
Mr. Wainwright's story

18:13.426 --> 18:15.161
that he wrote in college.

18:18.799 --> 18:21.334
‐ Mr. Wainwright wrote this?
‐ Yeah.

18:21.367 --> 18:24.204
He‐he gave it to me
so that I could learn

18:24.237 --> 18:27.473
by looking at a really
good news story.

18:27.508 --> 18:29.610
It‐it must be good.

18:29.643 --> 18:32.178
He got an A on it
from the prestigious

18:32.212 --> 18:34.748
Columbia University
School of Journalism.

18:40.486 --> 18:42.188
He got an A on it?

18:42.222 --> 18:43.123
Yeah.

18:52.733 --> 18:55.602
What grade did you give him?

19:00.541 --> 19:02.843
Doesn't make any difference.

19:02.876 --> 19:04.845
It's not your paper.

19:04.878 --> 19:05.779
But..

19:07.347 --> 19:09.783
...Mr. Wainwright give it to me.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.552
And you left it
on the kitchen table.

19:13.486 --> 19:16.389
But...but that don't mean
that you can take it.

19:16.422 --> 19:17.691
Finders keepers.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.194
Ah! Oh! Oh!

19:21.227 --> 19:22.763
[grunting]

19:23.997 --> 19:25.932
[gasping]

19:29.503 --> 19:32.238
You gave
Mr. Wainwright a C‐minus?

19:34.875 --> 19:36.510
I had my reasons.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.411
There was no name,
several comma problems..

19:38.444 --> 19:40.180
and I thought it went on a bit.

19:45.786 --> 19:48.454
Columbia School of Journalism?

19:48.488 --> 19:50.857
His instructor
was Edward R. Murrow.

19:55.261 --> 19:57.497
Oh, my Lord!

19:59.866 --> 20:01.868
[chuckling]
Cousin..

20:01.902 --> 20:05.338
...I‐I‐I've got to go
to another class.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.611
Po po po!

20:14.848 --> 20:15.749
Po.

20:19.520 --> 20:20.721
Edward R. Murrow?

20:21.955 --> 20:23.256
Oh!

20:37.938 --> 20:40.707
I want to discuss my grade.

20:40.741 --> 20:42.676
And your face.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.548
I'll be with you
in just a moment.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.918
[instrumental music]

21:02.495 --> 21:04.030
Hi, cousin.

21:04.064 --> 21:05.899
Where have you been?

21:05.932 --> 21:07.668
[sighing]

21:08.802 --> 21:10.336
I've been..

21:10.370 --> 21:11.705
...sitting in my classroom

21:11.738 --> 21:13.940
waiting for security
to walk me out of the building.

21:18.011 --> 21:20.747
You know,
during those four hours..

21:24.017 --> 21:26.520
...I did some thinking.

21:26.553 --> 21:29.890
And, uh, I‐I think I went a..

21:29.923 --> 21:32.526
...little over the edge
with this class.

21:34.995 --> 21:37.397
You know, cousin, on Mypos
when we teach sheep to jump

21:37.430 --> 21:40.901
over a fence, we don't just take
them to the Great Wall of Mypos

21:40.934 --> 21:43.504
on the very first day
and say, "jump, mutton head!"

21:45.972 --> 21:48.542
No, we‐we‐we start little.

21:48.575 --> 21:51.912
First, you teach the sheep
to jump over your foot.

21:51.945 --> 21:54.581
Which can be very encouraging
for the sheep.

21:54.615 --> 21:57.618
A‐although, at times..

21:57.651 --> 22:00.687
...painful for the teacher.

22:00.721 --> 22:03.423
But‐but, uh, what you do,
you, little by little

22:03.456 --> 22:05.058
you make the goals
higher and higher

22:05.091 --> 22:08.595
and before you know it
those sheep are playing

22:08.629 --> 22:10.363
Leap Sheep all over the meadow.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.136
You're right, Balki,
it was an introductory class.

22:16.169 --> 22:18.471
I‐I was too hard on them.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.006
Well, you still
have time to change.

22:21.542 --> 22:23.143
One of the things I did
while I was hiding

22:23.176 --> 22:25.712
under my desk..

22:25.746 --> 22:28.715
...was to grade
those papers over again.

22:28.749 --> 22:30.551
Did...did you‐did you
grade mine?

22:30.584 --> 22:32.118
Yes, I did.

22:32.152 --> 22:35.689
This time I graded
purely on content.

22:35.722 --> 22:37.490
‐ You got an A.
‐ I got an A!

22:37.524 --> 22:39.059
Balki, you got an A‐minus.

22:42.796 --> 22:43.864
An A‐minus?

22:45.131 --> 22:47.133
Hey, gimme a break.

22:47.167 --> 22:48.902
The best I could do
for Mr. Wainwright was a B.

22:50.470 --> 22:53.006
[instrumental music]

22:58.211 --> 23:00.714
[theme music]
