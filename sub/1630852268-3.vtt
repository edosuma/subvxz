WEBVTT

00:07.590 --> 00:10.593
Run and go!
In the hash! In the hash!

00:10.677 --> 00:13.263
Go! Go!

00:22.355 --> 00:24.691
The homophobia in the locker room, for me,

00:24.774 --> 00:27.610
is the hardest thing
for me to digest and go through.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.238
You do something wrong, or you bend over,

00:30.321 --> 00:33.324
or something was bad, it was "gay."

00:34.075 --> 00:35.785
Because, like, I looked up to you,

00:35.869 --> 00:38.163
you were my support system,
you were my everything.

00:39.372 --> 00:43.793
It always hurt more when I heard
people in authority, coaches, teachers…

00:45.503 --> 00:47.589
make comments or jokes.

00:48.214 --> 00:51.009
How am I supposed to be a football player

00:51.092 --> 00:54.054
and carry on a legacy
and do all these things and…

00:57.265 --> 00:58.516
be gay, you know?

00:59.225 --> 01:00.560
I hated myself for it.

01:01.352 --> 01:04.064
That's not what I was supposed to be.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.191
Put yourself in my shoes.

01:06.274 --> 01:08.818
If I was a coach
or someone you looked up to,

01:08.902 --> 01:10.653
or I knew what the environment was,

01:10.737 --> 01:14.199
and I knew that there were gay jokes
going around, would you come out?

01:17.577 --> 01:19.913
-No, the safest thing is not.
-Yeah.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.623
If you went to any town, though,

01:21.706 --> 01:24.000
you would get that same…
If you're an athlete…

01:24.084 --> 01:26.878
-I agree. I know.
-…it's a whole different… You know?

01:26.961 --> 01:28.963
-Yeah.
-It's a tough world, man.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.302
I don't see one of our guys
having the guts to come and say that…

01:34.385 --> 01:36.137
-I know.
-Like, "Coach, I'm gay."

01:38.473 --> 01:39.349
-You know?
-Yeah.

01:39.432 --> 01:41.935
-I just think that's--
-Why… But why… So…

01:42.560 --> 01:44.562
They would worry,
"What's my coach gonna think?"

01:44.646 --> 01:46.981
I really think they would think that.
You know?

01:48.566 --> 01:50.401
That's just a tough situation, man.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.196
I mean, because of the way society is.

01:54.489 --> 01:58.952
But if I ever had anything that I said
that made you uncomfortable or hurt you…

01:59.035 --> 02:00.578
You know that I love you.

02:00.662 --> 02:04.082
I apologize for that
if that happened along the way, you know,

02:04.707 --> 02:05.708
so…

02:06.501 --> 02:09.003
-I appreciate it.
-It's a tough world, man.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.507
But I think just…

02:13.216 --> 02:15.969
That was the thing too,
is I just wanted to talk to you.

02:18.263 --> 02:21.766
I don't know. I just think, in my opinion,
the one thing that stood out

02:21.850 --> 02:24.853
and the one thing I wanted
to talk to you about was just the…

02:25.687 --> 02:28.064
-environment that we were in…
-Right.

02:28.148 --> 02:31.693
…and, like, the words I heard
and the things I had happen to me

02:32.527 --> 02:33.862
impacted me, you know?

02:34.445 --> 02:35.446
Changed me.

02:48.751 --> 02:50.879
-And?

02:52.964 --> 02:54.007
Um…

02:55.049 --> 02:57.260
-I think I got my point across. I did.
-Okay.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.846
I think I got off my chest
what I needed to get off my chest,

02:59.929 --> 03:01.181
and it made me feel better.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.141
Okay. Well, that's good.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.476
Do you feel a sense of relief,

03:05.560 --> 03:07.061
-like your weight…
-Yeah.

03:07.145 --> 03:10.315
That was the most terrified
I think I've seen you in a long time.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.317
I mean, I don't know.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.944
There's still part of me that was like,
"Did he get it?"

03:15.028 --> 03:17.071
"Did he understand
what I was trying to say?"

03:17.155 --> 03:18.698
I'm naturally a people pleaser.

03:18.781 --> 03:21.784
I naturally try to make
people feel as comfortable as possible,

03:21.868 --> 03:24.871
and I'm realizing
sometimes my honesty and my truth

03:24.954 --> 03:26.831
might hurt people at the time,

03:26.915 --> 03:29.584
or might make people
feel bad or uncomfortable.

03:29.667 --> 03:33.546
I have to do it, because if I don't,
I'm gonna live with that regret.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.758
Since I've come out,
I think what I'm realizing is,

03:36.841 --> 03:39.886
you know, as tough as these conversations
are for me,

03:39.969 --> 03:43.640
the people that I come out to,
I don't know if they're necessarily ready.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.017
I'm still trying to figure out
how to handle that.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.729
I want him to understand
where I'm coming from,

03:49.812 --> 03:54.400
but I also want him to take some ownership
and also be like, "I fucked up."

03:54.484 --> 03:55.318
Yeah.

03:55.401 --> 03:56.778
Like, "When you were here,

03:56.861 --> 04:00.073
I didn't say things that probably put you
in the best position to come out."

04:00.156 --> 04:02.700
I would have loved for that,
like really direct.

04:02.784 --> 04:03.743
Mm-hmm.

04:03.826 --> 04:06.788
And I think he gave me
some reassurance of being like,

04:06.871 --> 04:10.667
"I want you to know if there is anything
I ever said or anything I ever did,

04:10.750 --> 04:11.584
I'm sorry."

04:11.668 --> 04:12.835
-Okay.
-Yeah.

04:12.919 --> 04:16.256
-Maybe not as direct as what you thought…
-Not as direct.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.968
And the people who love
and support you will understand

04:20.051 --> 04:22.637
that there's going to be
uncomfortable times,

04:22.720 --> 04:23.846
-and…
-Yeah.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.933
How else are you supposed to grow
and be honest and truthful?

04:28.017 --> 04:31.354
You're gonna hurt people's feelings,
and you're gonna mess up, and…

04:31.437 --> 04:35.400
But if you're living your truth…
I mean, it's been a long time coming.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.443
-You need to live it.
-Yeah.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.029
I'm so proud of you.

04:40.613 --> 04:41.447
You did it.

04:41.531 --> 04:42.365
Thanks.

04:44.158 --> 04:45.076
Come on!

04:59.590 --> 05:02.510
-Hello!
-What's up? How are you?

05:02.593 --> 05:06.639
-That's a damn handsome face, right there.
-I appreciate you, dude.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.517
-How you doing?
-Good, man. Living life.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.269
I've got my headphones on.
I don't know why.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.604
I was on the radio
I just had those on, so…

05:13.688 --> 05:16.566
What's made this process
easier to go through

05:16.649 --> 05:19.110
with all of these difficult conversations

05:19.193 --> 05:24.073
is having people in my corner
like Kassidy and Shelby and Gus.

05:24.157 --> 05:28.036
But one thing that I definitely need
more of is gay friends.

05:28.619 --> 05:33.041
I first met Cody
at a country music awards show.

05:33.124 --> 05:36.169
I didn't know he was gay at the time,
and I found out after,

05:36.252 --> 05:37.712
and I was like, "Holy shit."

05:37.795 --> 05:40.506
"So you can be gay
and like country music."

05:40.590 --> 05:41.424
"This is cool."

05:41.507 --> 05:43.301
And now that I've come out,

05:43.384 --> 05:45.386
you know, I really look up to him,

05:45.470 --> 05:47.805
and I think
that he can help me out quite a bit

05:47.889 --> 05:49.849
and be just a really good friend.

05:49.932 --> 05:52.769
Dude, let's have
a coming-out party in Nashville.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.687
I want to. I mean…

05:54.771 --> 05:59.317
Here's the thing, is I sort of avoided
this part of my life for a very long time.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.736
So I'm not very educated. Um…

06:02.278 --> 06:06.407
I had a lot of internal homophobia myself,
basically running from it my whole life.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.493
So I'm like… I wanna take baby steps.

06:08.576 --> 06:13.081
Dude, we can have
an amazing experience here, with…

06:13.164 --> 06:16.125
I mean, are we dating?
Are we gonna date, Colton, or what?

06:16.209 --> 06:18.044
I don't… I'm not ready for that.

06:18.127 --> 06:20.088
You're putting pressure on me
way too soon.

06:20.838 --> 06:22.090
Oh, you better get ready.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.592
-All right. I'll see you. Bye.
-See you. Bye. Thanks.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.123
Nashville, she cute.

06:55.206 --> 06:59.585
I've never actually experienced Nashville.
I have a lot of friends here, but…

06:59.669 --> 07:01.045
That's not what I heard.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.755
And I'm really well-liked here.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.090
Okay, stop bragging.

07:04.173 --> 07:06.008
As a straight man.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.553
I'm, like, a little nervous,
uh, being here,

07:08.636 --> 07:11.472
because Cody's gonna introduce me
to some of his friends.

07:11.556 --> 07:14.475
But it hasn't been like
I haven't really been put in a position

07:14.559 --> 07:18.604
to, like, have to flirt
or, like, get flirted with a whole ton.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.983
Besides you, when you make
your little… your little passes at me.

07:22.066 --> 07:24.360
I think what I'm looking forward to
most right now

07:24.444 --> 07:28.281
is I've had so many
heavy conversations about being gay,

07:28.364 --> 07:30.241
and now I can just be gay

07:30.324 --> 07:33.494
and enjoy the moment
and just sort of be present and be here.

07:34.662 --> 07:37.957
But I'm intimidated by being
in a room full of gay men because,

07:38.666 --> 07:41.419
one, I've never really been
in a room full of gay men.

07:41.502 --> 07:44.672
I don't know what to do with my hands.
Am I looking at someone too long?

07:44.755 --> 07:48.134
It's a little overwhelming,
and it's a little awkward.

07:48.718 --> 07:52.013
If one of Cody's friends is hot,
you wouldn't be into it or you'd…

07:52.096 --> 07:53.181
The kissing thing.

07:53.264 --> 07:56.058
To be honest,
I don't know the answer to that question.

07:56.142 --> 07:59.520
I almost feel like you should because
I feel like making out is the best.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.898
It can just be
such a stupid, throwaway, fun thing.

08:01.981 --> 08:05.318
I feel like I'll make out
with almost anybody on a dance floor

08:05.401 --> 08:08.279
if it's the right vibe and it's fun,
and who cares?

08:08.362 --> 08:10.239
I feel making out, to me,
like what you said,

08:10.323 --> 08:12.533
is one of the more intimate things
you can do.

08:12.617 --> 08:16.537
You're literally swapping saliva,
and, like, it's just… It's a lot.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.706
And I didn't even enjoy that on Bachelor.

08:18.789 --> 08:22.126
I didn't even enjoy making out on camera
with all the girls.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.587
Weird. It's almost like
you're gay or something.

08:25.880 --> 08:29.967
Colton is not totally comfortable
talking about sex,

08:30.051 --> 08:32.637
and I can see
that Colton gets so bashful and shy.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.056
I certainly was
that exact same way when I came out.

08:35.139 --> 08:37.934
But I think that just having
these uncomfortable conversations

08:38.017 --> 08:42.647
and just kinda pushing Colton's buttons
is my way of kind of using humor

08:42.730 --> 08:46.400
to… to chip away at him
and to try and help open him up

08:46.484 --> 08:48.486
to be more comfortable in his own skin.

08:48.569 --> 08:52.073
We should probably get you drunk
at some point. That will be fun.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.408
We're in a safe space.

08:54.992 --> 08:59.205
I never really wanted the real me
to come out, and I get a little loose,

08:59.288 --> 09:00.581
but maybe that's just me.

09:01.123 --> 09:04.293
No, that's literally everyone.
That's the point of drinking.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.212
Well, I don't drink a whole ton.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.756
I have an idea
for something we should do.

09:16.055 --> 09:19.350
-Welcome to your fantasy.
-Oh boy.

09:20.142 --> 09:22.103
-Hi, guys. How you doing?
-Doing well. You?

09:22.186 --> 09:26.274
-Can I help you find anything?
-No, we're just kind of looking around.

09:26.357 --> 09:29.068
You were… You wanted
to see some butt plugs and stuff.

09:29.151 --> 09:31.070
-This is my first time here.
-Gotcha.

09:31.779 --> 09:34.490
Colton is a Golden Retriever.

09:34.574 --> 09:40.121
He's, like, sweet, but he's also dopey,
and his tail's gonna knock stuff over,

09:40.204 --> 09:42.957
and especially with him
just now coming out

09:43.040 --> 09:46.002
and being this baby gay, figuring
everything out for the first time.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.129
And you just have to be patient with him

09:48.212 --> 09:50.298
'cause he doesn't realize
how big his paws are yet.

09:52.341 --> 09:55.052
I feel like there's so many options…
It's overwhelming.

09:55.136 --> 09:58.347
But it's totally expected.
And when I came out,

09:58.431 --> 10:03.603
I had a really lovely boyfriend that truly
taught me literally everything.

10:03.686 --> 10:05.521
I want to be that person for Colton.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.897
This is something I would wear.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.649
I feel like, as a rule of thumb,

10:08.733 --> 10:11.485
you don't buy regular clothes
from a sex store.

10:12.862 --> 10:16.115
-People get smacked with this?
-Bend over, I'll show you.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.367
-Ahh! Dude!
-Did it hurt?

10:18.451 --> 10:21.370
No, you almost got my sack, though.
It was underneath my leg.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.081
You gotta be more careful.
These are harnesses.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.750
-Shirt off.
-Oh boy.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.086
-Do my nipples go in here?
-No. Turn around.

10:30.921 --> 10:33.716
I'm not sure if it's sized right,
but I could get into this.

10:33.799 --> 10:34.759
This is pretty hot.

10:34.842 --> 10:38.012
-What is the point of it?
-For dancing and vibing. It's like…

10:38.638 --> 10:42.600
-Oh, this is like a… an aggressive thing.
-I'm into it.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.771
I actually would love to see
virgin Colton with the wings on.

10:46.854 --> 10:47.772
I can do that.

10:47.855 --> 10:50.608
I'd been in a sex store before,
prior to this.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.652
I had a hat and then sunglasses on,

10:52.735 --> 10:54.945
and I'd sneak around
and look at some of the gay stuff,

10:55.029 --> 10:58.366
but I would never buy it
because I didn't want the credit card,

10:58.449 --> 11:00.117
and people know my name
and put it together.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.578
So this is a completely different
experience for me.

11:02.662 --> 11:06.082
I actually get to be
present and adventurous,

11:06.165 --> 11:08.084
but it's definitely intimidating.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.710
-Give me a spin.

11:09.794 --> 11:12.463
-I mean, you're ready for Pride.

11:13.214 --> 11:17.259
I don't know if this is fully me,
but you know what? This is… I tried it.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.845
You know what my nickname used to be
in college?

11:19.929 --> 11:23.349
My college teammates called me Disney…
'cause I was rated G.

11:23.849 --> 11:26.394
That's cute.
So what looks good to you?

11:28.646 --> 11:31.941
I remember coming
into shops like this, like,

11:32.024 --> 11:35.444
a long, long time ago,
and being, like, stressed out.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.362
Yeah.

11:36.445 --> 11:39.699
But I feel like I've gotten to a point
where I'm comfortable,

11:39.782 --> 11:40.866
but I get if you're--

11:40.950 --> 11:44.286
-No, I would… Yeah.
-But you can ask me anything. I'll--

11:44.370 --> 11:46.163
-If I know, I'll explain it.
-Yeah.

11:46.247 --> 11:50.042
I'm still, like,
trying to figure out how much…

11:50.126 --> 11:55.506
Like, I do know some about some of it,
but I don't… at the same time.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.801
Me being sex-positive, in my mind,

11:58.884 --> 12:02.388
is just being comfortable
with your sexuality

12:02.471 --> 12:04.724
and comfortable talking about it.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.977
It doesn't necessarily mean
that you're shoving it in anybody's face,

12:08.060 --> 12:10.563
but it also means
that you're not hiding from it.

12:10.646 --> 12:15.025
And I think, like, forever,
gay sex has carried shame.

12:15.109 --> 12:17.445
And so I think
that part of the sex positivity

12:17.528 --> 12:19.113
is a reclaiming of that

12:19.196 --> 12:21.449
and being proud of it
and getting to have fun

12:21.532 --> 12:25.369
and do whatever it is that we want to do
without the taboo of doing it.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.330
But I also want Colton to know
that that's something that,

12:28.414 --> 12:30.207
if he wants to do it, that's wonderful,

12:30.291 --> 12:33.794
but he should also be mindful
and cognizant and safe about it.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.006
Using these things is safe.

12:37.089 --> 12:40.676
But if you're gonna get out there
and sleep with guys and hook up with guys,

12:40.760 --> 12:42.970
I also want to make sure
you're being safe.

12:43.053 --> 12:43.888
Yeah.

12:43.971 --> 12:46.432
I wanna make sure
you know all the things you need to,

12:46.515 --> 12:48.517
like PrEP and "U equals U."

12:48.601 --> 12:50.019
-And--
-U equals what?

12:50.102 --> 12:52.313
If someone has an HIV positive status,

12:52.396 --> 12:55.775
it means "undetectable
equals untransmittable."

12:55.858 --> 12:57.151
How do you know if you have it?

12:57.234 --> 12:59.236
You're supposed to get tested regularly,

12:59.320 --> 13:01.781
but if you want to make sure
you don't get an STD…

13:01.864 --> 13:05.409
you just stick with your trusty VixSkin.

13:05.493 --> 13:06.660
That's too big.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.621
-Yes.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.915
Yeah, I've hooked up with him before.

13:10.998 --> 13:12.875
-What?

13:12.958 --> 13:16.545
-That's his actual dick?
-Yeah. Includes every lifelike detail.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.464
Can confirm.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.716
-Interesting.
-Oh!

13:21.300 --> 13:23.969
-My parents are gonna love this show.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.481
-Am I at the right place? This it?
-What's up?

13:35.564 --> 13:38.776
-Gus.
-Good to see you. What's up? How are you?

13:38.859 --> 13:40.402
-How are you?
-I'm great.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.363
I'm gonna get some more champagne.
Want some?

13:42.446 --> 13:43.864
Let's do it. Absolutely.

13:44.490 --> 13:48.536
This is my first proper trip to Nashville.
Every time I'm here, I'm in and out.

13:48.619 --> 13:49.912
When did you come last?

13:49.995 --> 13:52.706
-"ACM" Fest? CMA Fest.
-CMA Fest, yeah.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.793
-That's where we first met, the ACMs.
-Yeah. ACMs in Vegas, right?

13:55.876 --> 13:57.878
In the VIP line.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.881
Got a lot of acronyms going on.
"VIP, CMT…"

14:00.965 --> 14:02.132
-CMAs.
-Yeah.

14:02.216 --> 14:05.135
-"…CMA, BDSM, LGBTQ."
-You know what?

14:05.219 --> 14:08.180
-You know what VIP means.
-That was on my birth certificate.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.811
Do you know that I slid into your DMs
when you came out?

14:14.436 --> 14:15.688
Wait, have we had sex?

14:15.771 --> 14:19.024
-We… Wait, did we? Hold on.
-I'm just kidding.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.485
-We haven't actually met, right?

14:21.569 --> 14:23.529
-Not in person, anyways.
-Okay.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.698
-We having a coming-out party?
-That's on you.

14:25.781 --> 14:27.992
-I don't know what you got planned.
-Okay.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.243
So before, though,

14:29.326 --> 14:32.288
I kind of want to know,
like, do you have a type?

14:32.371 --> 14:34.456
Part of me,
even when Gus or you ask me,

14:34.540 --> 14:36.667
I get sort of weirded out
'cause I'm like--

14:36.750 --> 14:38.252
Your face turns a little red…

14:38.335 --> 14:40.296
-Yeah.
-…when you start talking about it.

14:40.379 --> 14:43.841
I don't know. I'm an old soul,
so I'm looking for someone to match me.

14:44.341 --> 14:46.594
There's a few who qualify tonight,
I think.

14:46.677 --> 14:50.389
-So you invited some old souls tonight?
-He invited some old holes tonight.

14:51.640 --> 14:52.892
Oh no.

14:53.809 --> 14:56.770
Hearing the words, "We're gonna
throw you a coming-out party,"

14:56.854 --> 14:58.230
I'm, like, nervous.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.649
Like, I don't know what's…
what to expect here.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.484
-Colton.
-Hey. Gus.

15:02.568 --> 15:03.736
Lucas and Lucas.

15:03.819 --> 15:06.530
-My name's Colton.
-Oh, I know who you is.

15:06.614 --> 15:07.448
Oh, okay.

15:08.699 --> 15:12.578
This is a good friend of ours
from Nashville, Jaidynn Diore Fierce!

15:12.661 --> 15:15.456
-Yes! Fierce, fierce, fierce!
-Thanks for joining our party.

15:15.539 --> 15:18.292
When you got a drag queen around,
it is party time, okay?

15:18.375 --> 15:20.836
-Somebody should drag you up one day.
-Oh, shit.

15:20.920 --> 15:21.962
That would be fun!

15:22.046 --> 15:23.505
What would my drag name be?

15:23.589 --> 15:26.091
First dog when you were a kid
and the street you grew up on.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.718
-So…
-Diamond Main.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.721
-Diamond Main. Yes!
-Oh! Diamond Main!

15:30.804 --> 15:32.306
-Yes, I'm so excited.
-Yes!

15:39.396 --> 15:41.523
What's your favorite
female artist ever?

15:41.607 --> 15:44.068
In the community, your style,
you have your favorite--

15:44.151 --> 15:45.527
-Britney.
-Britney Spears?

15:45.611 --> 15:48.447
-Are you just saying that?
-No, he's saying, "That's mine."

15:49.740 --> 15:50.866
Are you a Gaga fan?

15:50.950 --> 15:53.827
I thought Gaga and Kesha
were the same people for four years.

15:53.911 --> 15:56.246
-That's honestly sacrilegious.
-Honestly…

15:56.872 --> 15:59.875
Hey, ladies! You watch The Bachelor?

15:59.959 --> 16:01.835
-Stop!

16:03.587 --> 16:05.589
No, I've never been
to a drag queen show.

16:05.673 --> 16:07.216
-You've never been to a drag show?
-No.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.843
I think it's about time
we popped your cherry, okay?

16:10.511 --> 16:12.930
I've heard that joke on TV before,
all right?

16:13.013 --> 16:16.350
But, listen, I would like that one
to actually be popped.

16:18.477 --> 16:19.603
But I've known I was gay

16:19.687 --> 16:22.106
since my eighth grade
or freshman year of high school.

16:22.189 --> 16:24.274
-I just hated myself for it.
-Aw.

16:24.358 --> 16:26.610
-So… But now I don't!
-Now you love yourself!

16:27.194 --> 16:31.448
That's amazing. It's part of your story.
I grew up in a very religious household.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.158
I went to Catholic grade school.

16:33.242 --> 16:37.538
Yeah. I was always told the worst things.
I'm going to hell, this and that.

16:37.621 --> 16:40.958
-God's still gonna love me. He made me.
-Amen. He still loves me too.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.876
Think he made me
this fabulous for nothing?

16:42.960 --> 16:44.211
That's what I'm saying!

16:44.294 --> 16:46.088
-I mean, hello?
-Yeah.

16:46.171 --> 16:49.425
-How long have you been doing this for?
-Probably about 13 years now.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.802
I'm like a teenager in drag queen years.

16:51.885 --> 16:55.556
I'm like a baby in gay years,
so we got something in common!

16:56.140 --> 16:59.309
There's some parts of gay culture
that I understand better than others.

16:59.393 --> 17:00.978
I'm enjoying learning new things.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.105
I'm gonna teach you
a one, two, three, four, five.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.024
-All right.
-Boom cat, cat-cat-cat, boom pow!

17:05.107 --> 17:08.110
I got zero coordination,
so I'm definitely down for some classes.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.862
I'm down for the challenge.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.238
For so long,

17:11.321 --> 17:15.492
I felt like I've neglected this part of me
and the gay community,

17:15.576 --> 17:18.412
but now that I'm here,
I'm like, "That's a fucking good time."

17:18.495 --> 17:19.496
Did you meet Casey?

17:19.580 --> 17:21.582
-We met.
-Yes. We met over here, but briefly.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.250
So Casey's a great guy.

17:23.917 --> 17:26.545
-Like, tremendous human.
-Yeah.

17:26.628 --> 17:29.173
The only downside with Casey
is he has really small arms.

17:30.549 --> 17:33.010
-You don't do any bicep curls, huh?

17:33.093 --> 17:34.344
I think it's genetic.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.266
-Guys, thanks for coming out tonight.
-Thank you.

17:39.349 --> 17:42.227
We appreciate each of you.
We look forward to seeing y'all again.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.437
That was fun though.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.898
I had so much fun.
Until next time.

17:45.981 --> 17:48.901
-Until next time? Ooh.
-Uh-oh.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.070
There's something going on
I don't know about.

17:51.153 --> 17:54.239
-Maybe there is, maybe there's not.
-You'll find out later, honey.

17:55.282 --> 17:58.827
-You still a gay in training. It's okay.

17:58.911 --> 18:02.581
-Are you guys ready to go back up?
-I don't drink. I'm boring. Mwah!

18:02.664 --> 18:04.541
-Thank you so much.
-That was so fun.

18:04.625 --> 18:07.044
-Nice seeing you.
-I know, it's been a long time.

18:07.127 --> 18:10.047
-Wish it was more often.
-Absolutely! Text me.

18:10.130 --> 18:11.215
-Let's do it.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.133
-Whoo-hoo!
-Thank you, baby.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.718
Hey, ping-pong!

18:15.219 --> 18:16.845
-Wow.
-Okay.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.806
Look at this. Look at this.

18:18.889 --> 18:20.224
You want to see the shower?

18:20.307 --> 18:23.143
-Everyone wants to see the shower.
-Let me show you the shower.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.728
-You see the shower yet?
-Yes.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.939
What about the shower?
You seen the shower?

18:27.022 --> 18:29.191
-I haven't seen the shower.
-This way.

18:29.274 --> 18:32.444
Three, four, five. There are six of us.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.571
This is your underwear, I guess.

18:34.655 --> 18:37.199
-Oh yeah.
-Somebody's gonna sell it on eBay.

18:39.993 --> 18:41.662
Very… It's very intense.

18:41.745 --> 18:42.788
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

18:42.871 --> 18:45.165
Oh!

18:45.249 --> 18:46.500
Oh!

18:49.419 --> 18:51.505
Yeah, there you go.

18:51.588 --> 18:52.589
That was a lot.

18:53.173 --> 18:55.843
-You guys wanna play "sting-pong"?
-What is "sting-pong"?

18:55.926 --> 18:57.302
Whoever misses gets hit.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.012
-Ready?
-This is not gonna work out.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.222
-Let's go.
-Come on.

19:00.722 --> 19:02.349
-Oh! That's you right away!
-No.

19:02.432 --> 19:03.684
-You're out.
-Practice run.

19:03.767 --> 19:06.145
This could be practice,
but I still get to hit you.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.647
-So me, because he was serving to me.
-Oh!

19:08.730 --> 19:10.816
-I like this game.

19:10.899 --> 19:13.110
-I broke the paddle!

19:13.193 --> 19:15.362
-Wow!
-Shit!

19:15.445 --> 19:16.321
Do it!

19:16.905 --> 19:17.739
Oh!

19:17.823 --> 19:19.700
-Okay, so he gets hit.
-Hold on.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.995
-Oh!
-Oh!

19:23.078 --> 19:24.913
-You ready, girl?
-I'm ready.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.709
-Oh!
-The most gayest shit we've done.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.377
You got fisted earlier, and you're like,

19:30.460 --> 19:32.838
-"This is the gayest thing I've done."
-I'm like, "Yeah, nah."

19:32.921 --> 19:33.922
This is so gay.

19:34.548 --> 19:38.969
The thing is, just 'cause I'm gay
and just because now I'm around gay men,

19:39.052 --> 19:40.679
I'm still the same person.

19:40.762 --> 19:42.556
I do not know how to dance.

19:42.639 --> 19:45.809
Um, I really have no clue
what to do with my hands.

19:45.893 --> 19:48.854
I'm still the same dude.
It's like, "Do I need to act different?"

19:49.438 --> 19:51.398
I really am trying to figure it all out.

19:51.481 --> 19:55.235
And right now, I'm in no position
to turn down a new gay friend.

19:55.777 --> 19:57.654
I need all the gay friends I can get.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.032
Colton, what's your favorite food?

20:01.658 --> 20:02.492
Sushi.

20:02.993 --> 20:03.827
Okay.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.830
-What's yours?
-Uh, Mexican.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.290
-Oh, my goodness.
-Mexican?

20:08.373 --> 20:09.458
Strike one. It's so hard.

20:09.541 --> 20:12.044
I can do Mexican, but in, like, doses.

20:12.127 --> 20:15.839
Yeah, my family owns a Mexican restaurant
back home in Kansas City, and it's…

20:15.923 --> 20:18.258
They have their own tortilla factory
and everything.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.384
-Sick.
-It's so funny.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.637
It's the carb thing that's weird for me.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.555
What? You have to eat carbs.

20:25.557 --> 20:26.767
Every once in a while.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.102
You have to eat carbs.

20:30.312 --> 20:31.772
Okay, so how's it going?

20:33.315 --> 20:34.441
-It's been good.
-Yeah?

20:34.524 --> 20:36.360
-Yeah.
-Are you overwhelmed yet?

20:37.194 --> 20:38.195
Um…

20:38.278 --> 20:40.739
Casey is a super sweet guy.

20:40.822 --> 20:43.492
I can tell he's genuine.
I can tell he's kind.

20:44.159 --> 20:46.662
But there still
is just this level of like,

20:47.871 --> 20:49.289
"Thanks, but no thanks" right now.

20:49.373 --> 20:50.874
-Dude.
-You feeling good?

20:50.958 --> 20:52.501
-Uh-huh.
-Anybody catch your eye?

20:53.168 --> 20:54.294
-No?
-Not yet.

20:55.003 --> 20:57.631
All these guys are great,
but there's nothing that's…

20:57.714 --> 20:58.840
You're not feeling it.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.843
…registering to me to be like,
"Yeah, cool. Let's do it."

21:01.927 --> 21:02.761
I get it.

21:02.844 --> 21:05.222
But I feel like you've put up a wall,

21:05.305 --> 21:07.599
so it's hard,
and you're gonna have to get through that.

21:07.683 --> 21:10.435
But I do think
that you've kind of, like, created

21:11.186 --> 21:13.438
this thing that makes it
bigger than it is.

21:13.522 --> 21:16.108
You don't have to have
any sort of justification for it

21:16.191 --> 21:18.610
for anybody, or even for yourself.

21:18.694 --> 21:19.569
Yeah.

21:19.653 --> 21:23.907
If you're really worried about
what other people are going to say, then…

21:25.033 --> 21:26.243
reconsider these jeans.

21:29.162 --> 21:31.164
-These jeans here--
-I'm just kidding.

21:31.248 --> 21:34.543
No, these jeans.
I'm saying they're so… they're so trash.

21:38.714 --> 21:39.631
What's up?

21:40.465 --> 21:42.884
Go shoot your shots.

21:43.593 --> 21:47.180
-I have no shots to shoot right now.
-You have plenty of shots to shoot.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.725
And you can shoot them
and be okay with it.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.060
God. I don't know where my water went.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.479
I'm gonna have to figure out
where my water is.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.857
I definitely feel like
everybody has this goal,

21:56.940 --> 21:59.276
or this is the mission
of the coming-out party,

21:59.359 --> 22:00.902
is to get Colton to hook up.

22:01.695 --> 22:02.946
And I'm not ready for it.

22:03.030 --> 22:06.199
And I feel like
everybody's just sort of pushing me.

22:06.283 --> 22:09.453
And that throws me off a bit
and makes me a little uncomfortable

22:09.536 --> 22:12.122
and… and puts me back in my shell.

22:12.205 --> 22:13.206
I'm not gonna lie.

22:13.290 --> 22:16.710
Coming here and knowing
you were throwing me a coming-out party

22:16.793 --> 22:18.712
has been intimidating 'cause I'm like…

22:19.921 --> 22:23.425
"Fuck, is this going to be met
with some expectations that I hook up?"

22:24.134 --> 22:25.260
I hope you do.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.220
I mean, because this is about you,

22:27.304 --> 22:31.808
your feelings, who you vibe with,
who you'd want to know better.

22:31.892 --> 22:35.937
I'm already struggling with trying to find
where I fit in, in this community,

22:36.021 --> 22:38.732
and tonight I feel a little defeated.

22:38.815 --> 22:41.151
This was my first time hanging out
in a room full of gay men,

22:41.234 --> 22:42.778
and I did not feel comfortable.

22:42.861 --> 22:45.405
So I don't know if I'm ready for this.

22:45.489 --> 22:47.240
-Go home.
-Bye, Shawn.

22:47.324 --> 22:48.241
Bye.

22:51.578 --> 22:52.954
That was fun.

22:53.830 --> 22:55.999
I don't know.
I was in my head a lot tonight.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.960
I'm not… I'm not gonna lie.
I'm not going to sugarcoat it.

22:59.836 --> 23:02.589
There was moments where I was like,
"I'd like to maybe go…"

23:02.672 --> 23:04.091
And I was like, "Agh, maybe not."

23:04.174 --> 23:06.968
Everybody's like,
"Just hook up, have a good time."

23:07.052 --> 23:09.846
There'd have been nothing more
that I'd have liked to let loose tonight

23:09.930 --> 23:12.224
and, like, probably make out with a guy.

23:12.307 --> 23:15.060
But that wasn't even
how I operated as a straight guy.

23:15.143 --> 23:19.064
I'm just trying to stick to what
I feel like I want out of a relationship.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.525
What do you want
out of a relationship?

23:21.608 --> 23:24.361
I want to be with somebody
and have an emotional connection,

23:24.444 --> 23:27.030
'cause I've never had
an emotional connection with a man.

23:27.114 --> 23:29.449
Well, for sure, that's exactly
what I'm trying to say.

23:29.533 --> 23:33.495
So then try and shed any expectation
of what you're supposed to do,

23:33.578 --> 23:35.080
who you're supposed to be,

23:35.163 --> 23:39.376
what this preconceived notion of gay is,
and just fucking be you.

23:40.335 --> 23:42.587
And one of the beautiful parts
about being gay

23:42.671 --> 23:46.716
is that there is no sort of, like,
social construct that you have to follow.

23:46.800 --> 23:50.011
A relationship, whenever you find one,
can be whatever you want,

23:50.095 --> 23:52.639
whether it's, like,
a monogamous relationship

23:52.722 --> 23:55.475
or an open relationship
or a polyamorous relationship.

23:55.559 --> 23:59.354
It's beautiful that you have the freedom
to do whatever it is that you want.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.566
Being gay doesn't necessarily mean

24:02.649 --> 24:04.651
you're partying
and having sex all the time,

24:04.734 --> 24:06.653
although there's nothing wrong with that.

24:06.736 --> 24:09.030
I think Cody has
the best of intentions for Colton.

24:09.114 --> 24:12.284
I think he really just wanted
to show him a good time in Nashville.

24:12.367 --> 24:15.787
I think that ultimately Colton
is just still a little uncomfortable,

24:15.871 --> 24:17.873
and it's… it's a process.

24:17.956 --> 24:21.543
Well, the thing is,
tonight's not the end-all, be-all.

24:21.626 --> 24:24.212
I feel like there's someone
I could introduce you to.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.755
I have good friends.

24:25.839 --> 24:27.632
This version of gay culture,

24:27.716 --> 24:31.094
he's maybe not necessarily
seeing how he fits into it,

24:31.178 --> 24:34.681
but I want him to know there are a million
ways he can fit into the community,

24:34.764 --> 24:37.350
and him being exactly who he is will fit.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.811
And so I want him to just understand that,

24:39.895 --> 24:42.689
'cause I think right now,
he thinks it's very one-way.

24:42.772 --> 24:44.733
-Good night! Proud of you.
-Good night! Thank you.

24:54.659 --> 24:55.660
Here we are.

25:00.540 --> 25:01.458
Who is it?

25:04.294 --> 25:05.128
Hi.

25:05.212 --> 25:06.671
-It's Gus!
-What's up?

25:06.755 --> 25:07.923
This is for you.

25:08.006 --> 25:09.591
-No, that is for me.
-This is for--

25:09.674 --> 25:10.842
I always get it confused.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.928
-What's up?
-Who is this tall, handsome guy?

25:13.011 --> 25:14.304
-Hi, I'm Colton.
-Russell.

25:14.387 --> 25:18.725
Colton seems like he really wants
to settle down and have a family.

25:18.808 --> 25:20.143
Low-five. Yeah.

25:20.227 --> 25:24.397
I wanna introduce Colton to some
people who are a little more his speed,

25:24.481 --> 25:28.443
Russell and Miles,
who have kids and a home in the suburbs.

25:28.527 --> 25:32.113
And I think that it'll be nice
for Colton to meet them and talk to them.

25:32.739 --> 25:34.157
All right, I have to warn you.

25:34.241 --> 25:37.494
He is obsessed right now
this week with three things…

25:38.036 --> 25:39.412
Making brownies,

25:39.496 --> 25:41.248
WWE wrestling,

25:41.331 --> 25:43.208
and, uh, baseball.

25:43.291 --> 25:45.085
-Two very gay interests…
-Yeah.

25:46.795 --> 25:49.548
Should we go in the kitchen?
Because guess what we're gonna do?

25:49.631 --> 25:51.883
-Brownies!
-Brownies?

25:53.843 --> 25:56.012
Let's go. You guys want anything
to drink or anything?

25:56.096 --> 25:58.014
-I'm good. Thank you.
-I wanna, though.

25:58.098 --> 26:00.350
-Ask Gus if you can have one.
-Gus, I want one.

26:00.433 --> 26:02.102
-What's the magic word?
-Please.

26:02.185 --> 26:04.771
-Yeah, you can have whatever you want.

26:04.854 --> 26:07.065
-Your house is beautiful, by the way.
-Thank you.

26:07.148 --> 26:10.569
We met 11, 12 years ago,
and got this place a year and a half ago.

26:10.652 --> 26:12.279
'Cause we have Sebastian.

26:12.362 --> 26:16.116
We just started the adoption process.
We want a little girl or a little boy.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.534
I want one of these.

26:17.617 --> 26:18.868
You want one of these?

26:19.369 --> 26:22.998
His favorite thing, though,
you guys gotta let him do the honors.

26:23.081 --> 26:24.124
Wanna hold on to this?

26:24.207 --> 26:26.126
-Then half a cup.
-Wanna hang onto this?

26:26.209 --> 26:29.129
You wanna hear a funny story?
On my 39th birthday,

26:29.629 --> 26:32.299
I, uh…
I tapped him on the shoulder and I say,

26:32.382 --> 26:35.594
"If we don't start the process this year,
we're not doing it."

26:35.677 --> 26:37.429
I looked over and said,
"Are your eggs dying?"

26:39.514 --> 26:42.934
And so, uh, from the moment
I tapped him on the shoulder

26:43.018 --> 26:45.770
to the moment we had baby in hand
was only seven months.

26:45.854 --> 26:47.814
It was crazy.

26:47.897 --> 26:51.610
Like, I don't know. I would like…
A gay guy and I'd like to go out,

26:51.693 --> 26:54.779
whatever, but once we had the kid,
everything changes, man.

26:54.863 --> 26:56.531
Can I have a bite of that?

26:56.615 --> 26:57.449
Tomorrow.

26:57.532 --> 26:58.908
-He says--
-Tomorrow?

27:00.493 --> 27:02.871
-So, where did you grow up?
-I grew up in Illinois.

27:02.954 --> 27:04.289
-So did I!
-Really?

27:04.372 --> 27:06.625
-Southern Illinois.
-Right outside of Peoria.

27:06.708 --> 27:10.045
-No! That's so awesome.
-Yeah, Washington. Yep.

27:10.128 --> 27:12.797
But, growing up in Illinois,
just like… Pfft.

27:12.881 --> 27:14.466
-Yeah.
-There was no gay people.

27:14.549 --> 27:17.844
And the first openly gay person I met
was when I moved to LA,

27:17.927 --> 27:19.512
the office manager in our building.

27:19.596 --> 27:22.307
I walked in, and he was
just this flamboyant gay guy.

27:22.390 --> 27:25.852
I was like, "Wait, that guy is gay,
and nobody's beating him up."

27:25.935 --> 27:27.771
-"What's going on here?"
-Yeah. Yeah.

27:27.854 --> 27:30.065
-Right?
-That's how my experience was.

27:30.148 --> 27:33.860
-I need to go outside.
-No, we're not ready yet, bud. Come here.

27:33.943 --> 27:35.779
-All right.
-You wanna have kids?

27:35.862 --> 27:39.741
-One day, but probably not for a minute.
-A minute. What about you?

27:39.824 --> 27:41.493
Yeah. I wanna be a father soon.

27:42.077 --> 27:43.495
-It's the best. Soon?
-Yeah.

27:43.578 --> 27:45.538
In five minutes
or that "not for a minute"?

27:45.622 --> 27:46.998
"Seven months sounds good."

27:47.082 --> 27:49.793
I would think about
doing it myself too, if I had to.

27:49.876 --> 27:51.127
-Really?
-Yeah.

27:51.211 --> 27:52.170
It's a lot.

27:52.253 --> 27:53.171
Yeah.

27:53.254 --> 27:54.964
Put this in my back.

27:55.465 --> 27:57.133
-I want it on me.
-Turn around.

27:57.217 --> 28:00.387
Here, I got you. I'll do it for you.
You're like a Ninja Turtle.

28:00.470 --> 28:02.764
Um, so when I was in the second grade,

28:02.847 --> 28:05.141
my teacher asked
what I wanted to be when I grew up.

28:05.225 --> 28:08.728
And I wrote down on a piece of paper,
I said "NFL player."

28:08.812 --> 28:11.815
She sent me to my seat and told me
to pick a more realistic career.

28:11.898 --> 28:12.941
-No.

28:13.024 --> 28:14.484
-So I crossed it off.
-Yeah.

28:14.567 --> 28:16.695
-And I put "a stay-at-home dad."
-Wow.

28:16.778 --> 28:20.490
So I might be able to accomplish
both of them, uh, in my lifetime.

28:20.573 --> 28:21.491
Yeah.

28:22.492 --> 28:27.163
If there's one thing I'm not gonna
sacrifice, it's not not going to be a dad.

28:27.247 --> 28:30.417
Nineteen months
when we moved in. Now he's this big.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.711
It's like, they grow so fricking fast.

28:32.794 --> 28:35.255
-That's awesome.
-Come outside.

28:35.338 --> 28:37.298
You wanna show me something? Let's go.

28:37.382 --> 28:38.675
Russell and Miles,

28:38.758 --> 28:42.679
their family represents something
that I did not see a whole lot of.

28:42.762 --> 28:45.098
This is definitely something
that I can look at

28:45.181 --> 28:48.435
and be like,
"I think I want something like that."

28:48.518 --> 28:50.603
What are… What am I seeing, real quick?

28:50.687 --> 28:53.690
-He did caca over there.
-There's caca?

28:53.773 --> 28:56.568
-Yeah. Don't step in it.
-Don't step in it? I won't.

28:56.651 --> 28:58.987
-Wanna play baseball?
-He's showing me the dog poop.

28:59.070 --> 28:59.904
-Okay.
-Yeah.

28:59.988 --> 29:03.074
-He said don't step in it.
-I wanna play baseball right now.

29:03.158 --> 29:05.493
-Okay.
-Wanna play baseball?

29:05.577 --> 29:08.621
Still today, I can go to the supermarket
and people are like,

29:08.705 --> 29:10.081
"He looks just like you."

29:10.165 --> 29:12.917
And I feel bad saying he's adopted,

29:13.001 --> 29:15.879
-so I'm just like, "Thank you."
-You just shouldn't. Yeah.

29:15.962 --> 29:18.673
Colton, I feel like
if you started the adoption process,

29:18.757 --> 29:20.592
you would get matched pretty quickly too.

29:20.675 --> 29:21.885
-Really?
-Yeah.

29:21.968 --> 29:25.180
-I mean, you'd be a good dad.

29:25.263 --> 29:26.097
You say that,

29:26.181 --> 29:29.392
but he doesn't even have toilet paper
in the powder rooms in his house.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.437
But, Colton,
do you wanna be with a partner

29:32.520 --> 29:34.481
and have, like, a husband or boyfriend?

29:34.564 --> 29:37.150
-I would, ideally, love to get married.
-Yeah.

29:37.233 --> 29:41.362
I would do it alone. But I would like
to get married and have a partner.

29:41.446 --> 29:44.824
Has he had to deal with questions
about having two dads instead of one dad?

29:44.908 --> 29:48.870
He did. We had a moment
where our nanny, Susie…

29:48.953 --> 29:52.457
During COVID, she was bringing her son,
and he would call her "Mommy."

29:52.540 --> 29:54.584
And he started asking for "Mommy."

29:55.210 --> 29:58.254
So, immediately, I talked to him
that night when I put him to bed.

29:58.338 --> 30:00.715
I was like, "Listen, you have two dads."

30:00.799 --> 30:02.592
You know? "We chose you."

30:02.675 --> 30:03.885
"You're so special."

30:04.761 --> 30:06.095
"Some kids have two moms."

30:06.179 --> 30:08.723
"Some kids have a dad and mom,
some have just one dad."

30:08.807 --> 30:11.100
-Wanted this one.
-Okay. You ready?

30:11.684 --> 30:14.062
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

30:14.145 --> 30:15.313
Oh!

30:15.396 --> 30:16.940
-Run your bases!
-Great job!

30:17.023 --> 30:19.442
-We're going home!
-Run, run, run, run!

30:19.526 --> 30:21.528
Come on, keep going. Keep running.

30:21.611 --> 30:23.905
-And he's home!
-He's home!
