(Tessa)
In high school,
there's practically

00:03.003 --> 00:04.004
no limit to the number
of things

00:04.045 --> 00:05.672
you can try your hand at.

00:05.714 --> 00:07.882
In a surprise move,
I had recently signed up

00:07.924 --> 00:10.051
for liking Ryan Shay.

00:10.093 --> 00:11.886
A year ago, I would've
looked over there and thought

00:11.928 --> 00:14.639
what a bunch of dumb jocks.

00:14.681 --> 00:17.767
And now, I look over there
and think, "Hey, Ryan."

00:17.809 --> 00:19.436
I think this whole
adoption thing

00:19.477 --> 00:21.229
has really helped
humanize him.

00:21.271 --> 00:23.898
You know, like when we
found out about Dave Thomas.

00:23.940 --> 00:27.861
Suddenly his frozen dairy
dessert tasted bittersweet.

00:27.902 --> 00:30.905
Good day, Miss Altman.
Keeping it tight, I presume?

00:30.947 --> 00:32.365
What's wrong with you?

00:32.407 --> 00:33.825
I-I didn't know
if people at school

00:33.867 --> 00:35.952
were supposed to know
about us or not.

00:35.994 --> 00:38.204
- Know what?
- About our love.

00:38.246 --> 00:39.914
And how tender it is.

00:39.956 --> 00:42.250
Don't be weird.
I don't care.

00:44.085 --> 00:45.295
You hear that, Chatswin?

00:45.336 --> 00:46.463
She doesn't care!

00:46.504 --> 00:48.339
Tessa and I aren't embarrassed

00:48.381 --> 00:50.800
to express
how tender our love is.

00:50.842 --> 00:52.260
It's extremely tender!

00:52.302 --> 00:53.845
[all cheering]

00:53.887 --> 00:55.513
Yeah, man.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.809
Congratulations, Tessa.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.603
I had no idea
things were so tender

01:01.644 --> 01:02.645
between the two of you.

01:02.687 --> 01:04.147
No one in their wildest dreams

01:04.189 --> 01:06.274
expected you
to snag a football player.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.942
It would be like
that runner with no legs

01:07.984 --> 01:08.985
winning the Olympics.

01:09.027 --> 01:10.278
- Thanks.
- Listen.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.031
You are a
football girlfriend now.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.450
And we're going to look past
your negativity and smugness

01:15.492 --> 01:19.120
and embrace you, because that's
what football girlfriends do.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.247
You can shadow me
till you get the hang of it.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.208
Don't worry.
You're in good hands.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.250
Amber's trained
some of the best football

01:24.292 --> 01:25.668
girlfriends in the field.

01:25.710 --> 01:27.462
You should put that
on your college application.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.798
Why would I go to college?

01:29.839 --> 01:32.050
I've already met
my future husband.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.718
From now on,
before signing up for things

01:33.760 --> 01:35.762
I should remember
to read the fine print.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.472
(Dallas)
'Look at that fine print.'

01:37.514 --> 01:40.475
And look at the DPI, George.
Just look at it!

01:40.517 --> 01:42.435
This printer is the best thing
that's ever happened to me

01:42.477 --> 01:44.062
and I met Garry Shandling.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.272
With this printer,
I can finally print

01:46.314 --> 01:48.024
people's dreams come true.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.442
But this isn't
my dream, right?

01:49.484 --> 01:51.069
Don't be silly.
You're a monarch.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.488
'See how lush and saturated
you look, George?'

01:53.530 --> 01:55.406
Even Yakult
said you look saturated.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.283
Yes, okay, thank you, Dallas.

01:57.325 --> 01:59.327
This is very sweet.
I appreciate it.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.495
Should we start
cutting the tabs?

02:00.537 --> 02:03.456
I have to go meet Noah.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.166
- George?
- Huh?

02:05.208 --> 02:06.501
What is that?

02:06.543 --> 02:08.294
Oh, that's just
some files and stuff.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.671
They don't look like files.

02:09.712 --> 02:12.549
They look like
more of my flyers.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.676
Yeah, th-th-that's what I said.

02:14.717 --> 02:16.386
File-ers.

02:16.427 --> 02:17.804
Sometimes my
Southern accent comes out

02:17.846 --> 02:20.390
from my semester
in Charleston.

02:20.431 --> 02:22.350
- Honey child.
- Oh.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.112
I wanted to have an open mind

02:34.154 --> 02:35.738
about the football girlfriends.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.866
They just made it so damn hard.

02:37.907 --> 02:39.534
This is where we
bake the treats

02:39.576 --> 02:40.827
'for the goody bags
that we give'

02:40.869 --> 02:42.787
'to our boyfriends on game day.'

02:42.829 --> 02:44.205
'We don't do it
for the thank yous'

02:44.247 --> 02:45.874
because they don't
say thank you.

02:45.915 --> 02:47.917
We do it
because it's tons of fun.

02:51.087 --> 02:53.715
So this is where we do
our boyfriends' homework

02:53.756 --> 02:56.009
so they can focus on practice.

02:56.050 --> 02:58.386
So we do this
for the thank yous?

02:58.428 --> 03:00.805
Tessa, no.
There are no thank yous.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.557
We do this
because it helps our guys

03:02.599 --> 03:04.851
to concentrate on victory
and over time

03:04.893 --> 03:07.854
their victories will start
to feel like your victories.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.898
And that's its own reward.
You'll see.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.197
And this is the pep rally
nerve center.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.574
Wow!

03:19.616 --> 03:21.284
Looks like..

03:21.326 --> 03:22.785
[sighs]
...a sweatshop.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.245
We call it the devotion pit.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.247
'It's where we make
the T-shirts, banners'

03:26.289 --> 03:28.917

that express our love

03:28.958 --> 03:30.793
loyalty, and allegiance.

03:30.835 --> 03:32.879
So you girls are basically
mindless servants

03:32.921 --> 03:35.423
struggling to uphold
outdated gender roles?

03:35.465 --> 03:37.091
Now you got it.

03:37.133 --> 03:40.345
And the longer you serve, the
louder you cheer. You'll see.

03:41.679 --> 03:43.890
It's Derek.

03:43.932 --> 03:47.268
Let's go, Derek!
Way to dial that phone, baby!

03:47.310 --> 03:48.895
Good phone answer, Joan.

03:48.937 --> 03:51.481
- Thanks.
- No.

03:51.522 --> 03:53.566
Derek may have been into it,
but some people

03:53.608 --> 03:54.859
find relentless cheer-leading..

03:54.901 --> 03:56.194
Stifling.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.279
You know, to, to me
each one of those flyers

03:58.321 --> 04:00.990
might as well say,
"I judge you, George Altman.

04:01.032 --> 04:03.618
I judge you for not being
successful enough."

04:03.660 --> 04:05.578
Dallas is judgey. She is.

04:05.620 --> 04:08.206
When she met me,
I was not a skylight king.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.583
Look, if you're
the skylight king

04:10.625 --> 04:12.627
then she's the queen.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.170
Alright, and that, my friends,
is what they all want.

04:14.212 --> 04:17.340
They want status.
They-they want stability.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.968
Why do you think
I became a dentist?

04:20.009 --> 04:21.427
I could've been anything.

04:21.469 --> 04:22.971
Have you ever seen me
on the uneven bars?

04:23.012 --> 04:25.682
He's like an eagle...with arms.

04:25.723 --> 04:27.141
And two legs.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.768
And a monkey's face.
He's like a monkey.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.645
It doesn't seem fair
that they can thrust

04:30.687 --> 04:32.105
these roles upon us.

04:32.146 --> 04:34.107
Forcing us to build
miniature cities

04:34.148 --> 04:35.692
in our basements.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.070
I'm building a miniature

- 'Okay.'

If you could start any business

04:42.907 --> 04:44.826
right now, what would it be?

04:45.994 --> 04:47.578
I'd be in the business
of rocking.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.998
Ooh! Bad boy.

04:50.039 --> 04:51.666
I was in a dad band
a few years ago.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.584
I played the bass guitar.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.670
Slapped her silly.
Named her Rhoda.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.797
I'm a big fan of that TV show.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.550
Loved it.
Never missed an episode.

05:00.591 --> 05:03.720
Guys, we're dads,
dads who rock.

05:03.761 --> 05:05.471
Why is it..

05:05.513 --> 05:07.181
...we are not
rocking out together?

05:07.223 --> 05:09.225
- I don't know.
- That's a good question!

05:09.267 --> 05:10.476
Then what say ye?

05:10.518 --> 05:12.562
Dads, shall we redefine
who we are

05:12.603 --> 05:14.439
and define who it is
we want to be?

05:14.480 --> 05:17.442
Yea, verily,
shall we do something

05:17.483 --> 05:20.111
that our partners
can't control or dictate?

05:20.153 --> 05:24.282
Shall we call our band
Sheila's Pets?

05:24.324 --> 05:25.783
No, Fred.
No, we shall not.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.493
That is a terrible name.

Oh.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.501
So how are you and the football
girls getting along?

05:35.543 --> 05:37.962
- Great.
- I knew you'd hit it off.

05:38.004 --> 05:41.382
Amber's had a really
interesting journey.

05:41.424 --> 05:45.762
She always wanted to date
Renaldo, our tight end

05:45.803 --> 05:47.930
but she used to be fat.

05:47.972 --> 05:50.266
Then she lost a ton of weight..

05:52.727 --> 05:54.437
...and then they hooked up.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.690
No. Yeah,
that's really interesting.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.067
Yeah, it is interesting.

05:59.108 --> 06:01.486
It's interesting
and it's inspiring.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.237
Really inspiring.

06:03.279 --> 06:06.491
Yeah, she's...
got a great story.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.951
Oh, ah, that reminds me,
I'm supposed to give Renaldo

06:08.993 --> 06:12.497
a noogie at 12:45.
I'd better go. Shoot.

06:12.538 --> 06:15.333
- Bye.
- Bye-bye. Bye.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.918
So wait,
did you actually think

06:16.959 --> 06:18.461
that girl's story
was interesting?

06:18.503 --> 06:19.754
- Nope.
- Right.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.631
So why aren't you
being honest with Ryan?

06:21.672 --> 06:23.591
Okay, you know
how sometimes I can..

06:23.633 --> 06:26.427
...be a little negative
or...smug?

06:26.469 --> 06:28.179
- Preachy at times.
- Right.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.056
- Soapboxy.
- Okay, Lisa. Yep.

06:30.098 --> 06:33.851
I'm, I'm trying
not to do that.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.603
I'm just trying
to be supportive.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.605
Interesting.

06:37.647 --> 06:40.233
Well, I guess conformity's
a small price to pay

06:40.274 --> 06:44.695
if you wanna date a big,
beefy football player.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.989
S-so what, football's
a better sport than lacrosse?

06:47.031 --> 06:50.451
Yes, Malik. Ignore him.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.578
Maybe this is what it means
to be dating Ryan, right?

06:52.620 --> 06:54.414
You know, some people's
physiques lend themselves

06:54.455 --> 06:57.083
more to lacrosse, which-which
is a lot harder than it looks.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.168
You are embarrassing
yourself, Malik.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.963
No, you are.

Nobody knows what you're
talking about, Malik.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.597
- Should we--
- No, just eat your food.

07:11.639 --> 07:13.516
Don't cause a scene.

07:13.558 --> 07:16.644
Okay, so tonight we're working
on the giant paper banner

07:16.686 --> 07:18.771
that the team will run through
at the pep rally.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.940
Typically, we work
with puffy pens and glitter

07:20.982 --> 07:24.026
but if you wanna try
something else...don't.

07:24.068 --> 07:26.696
It's best if you just stick
with the puffy pens and glitter.

07:26.737 --> 07:29.866
- Okay.

Pretty sweet.

07:59.061 --> 08:01.731
I have to say, it felt good
to finally tell Sheila

08:01.772 --> 08:03.941
I found a deer tick
and had to run to urgent care.

08:03.983 --> 08:06.736

Are you, are you drawing
a frog on the banner?

08:44.815 --> 08:46.317
You're not,
you're not supposed to.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.902
Oh, I..

08:47.944 --> 08:49.362
...just..

08:49.403 --> 08:51.197
...know how to draw them, so..

08:51.239 --> 08:52.907
Yeah, I would, I would
just stick to the letters

08:52.949 --> 08:54.617
because if we draw pictures
the players will

08:54.659 --> 08:56.327
stop and look at 'em
instead of--

08:56.369 --> 08:59.205
Destroying the artwork
we spent all night making?

08:59.247 --> 09:01.999
You seem a little bit on edge.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.339

09:08.381 --> 09:10.132
to make the night go by faster.

09:10.174 --> 09:11.676

09:16.305 --> 09:18.349
- Keep your voice down.
- What's that?

09:18.391 --> 09:21.727
Oh, you think it's dumb
we can't draw frogs? I agree!

09:21.769 --> 09:24.021
- I never, I-I never said that.
- Come on!

09:24.063 --> 09:25.731
I'm sure there's
all sorts of things you girls

09:25.773 --> 09:27.650
wish you could do, but you
can't, because you're here.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.652
You know what's better
than being here--

09:29.694 --> 09:31.070
There's nothing better.
She's drunk.

09:31.112 --> 09:32.655

on her breath.

Well, it's called..

...going home.

a soapbox, but I am on one.

are just as important

She's hungry.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.680
She wants to go out for a slice.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.265
How did she know that?

09:59.307 --> 10:01.475
And you. What's your name?

10:01.517 --> 10:05.146
- I'm Derek's girlfriend.
- What is your name, child?

10:05.187 --> 10:10.026
- I wanna say...Joan.
- I bet you do.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.986

You look like a Joan.

over there

10:14.280 --> 10:16.407
with a bloody Jersey
wrapped around her hand?

10:16.449 --> 10:18.534
Shouldn't she be seen
by a doctor?

10:18.576 --> 10:21.746
- Sean says it's in my head.
- It's not in your head.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.415
You are bleeding from your hand.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.792
She should be in urgent care
and we should

10:26.834 --> 10:29.003
all be at home watching TV.

You saw her.

13:01.155 --> 13:03.657
Guys...I have been in a lot

13:03.699 --> 13:05.743
of bands in my life,
high school punk bands

13:05.785 --> 13:07.745
college alt bands,
I was briefly a member

13:07.787 --> 13:09.497
of Five For Fighting
before they got big

13:09.538 --> 13:12.124
and I have never in my life

13:12.166 --> 13:15.294
felt the kind of spark...
I did tonight.

13:15.336 --> 13:16.337
What are you saying?

13:16.378 --> 13:17.379
I'm saying I think we should

13:17.421 --> 13:18.798

that means? We could be good!

Mein Vater Band because..

13:35.523 --> 13:36.565
...we stood for something.

13:36.607 --> 13:38.275
We stood for not hanging out

- Dallas, lemme explain, please.
- There's nothing to explain,.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.803
You started your little band
with your little friends

17:34.845 --> 17:37.389
so you could avoid doing
fun printing jobs with me.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.808

now I, I know you

17:39.850 --> 17:41.935

and powerful

17:41.977 --> 17:44.688
and to grow my business
into some huge empire

17:44.730 --> 17:47.775

to admit that I am this

she really doesn't need

a little defensive

[school bell ringing]

19:03.559 --> 19:06.520
[instrumental music]

19:10.190 --> 19:12.151
- Interception.
- Funny.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.319
Thanks.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.658
I'm really sorry...
about yesterday.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.870
It's possible that I
overreacted a little bit.

19:22.911 --> 19:24.371
But you made me think.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.456
I didn't want to,
but you made me

19:26.498 --> 19:29.543
like you always do,
and I think..

19:29.585 --> 19:31.587
...that everyone
needs to be cheered for

19:31.628 --> 19:33.589
not just us guys.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.509
So.. Bros?

19:41.221 --> 19:43.140
What's this?

19:43.182 --> 19:46.435
I want you to see how good
it feels to run through paper.

19:46.476 --> 19:48.103
I don't wanna run through paper.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.022
I did your thing.
Now you're gonna try mine.

19:51.732 --> 19:52.983
I want you to know
how good it feels

19:53.025 --> 19:54.985
to have someone
rooting for you.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.655
Okay. Fine.

19:58.697 --> 20:01.575
[instrumental music]

20:03.076 --> 20:05.871
Three, two, one!

20:08.081 --> 20:09.082
Go!

20:09.124 --> 20:11.501
[music continues]

20:11.543 --> 20:14.671
I had to admit,
it was pretty exhilarating..

20:16.089 --> 20:18.342
...and a little embarrassing.

20:19.676 --> 20:20.719
Whoo!

20:20.761 --> 20:22.512
Crush those numbers, Tessa!

20:22.554 --> 20:24.598
'Destroy that math!'

20:24.640 --> 20:25.641
'Yeah!'

20:27.517 --> 20:29.478
Are all the parks
clothing-optional?

20:29.519 --> 20:32.272
Yeah, but I haven't been able
to find any nude figurines

20:32.314 --> 20:33.482
at that scale, so..

20:33.523 --> 20:34.858
Okay.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.904
"Chinese Chicken."

20:38.946 --> 20:42.032
And, you, you get to name
the band whatever you want.

20:43.158 --> 20:44.910
I don't know, George.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.578
I think it's kind of ruined now.

20:46.620 --> 20:48.288
Yeah, and if you love
Sheila so much

20:48.330 --> 20:50.457
why don't you marry her?
Please don't.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.918
Look, you have every right
to be upset with me
