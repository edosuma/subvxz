WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:07.485
The chief's son is
trafficking underage girls.

00:07.485 --> 00:09.052
<i>There are over two dozen girls</i>

00:09.052 --> 00:11.402
<i>that have gone through his
doors that no longer exist.</i>

00:11.402 --> 00:13.317
<i>I run a Safe Place program.</i>

00:13.317 --> 00:15.493
This is me helping
the kids in my care.

00:15.493 --> 00:16.886
<i>I don't care who
your father is.</i>

00:16.886 --> 00:18.061
You can't tail me
and you can't be

00:18.061 --> 00:19.410
on the premises
without permission.

00:19.410 --> 00:21.412
My dad says you're
falling off the deep end.

00:21.412 --> 00:22.674
<i>We got to be patient.</i>

00:22.674 --> 00:24.154
If there's something--
- There is.

00:24.154 --> 00:25.677
There's something there.

00:25.677 --> 00:26.983
<i>We should loop in
the rest of the team.</i>

00:26.983 --> 00:28.376
That way, we always have eyes.

00:28.376 --> 00:31.379
I want to keep this
between you and me.

03:22.419 --> 03:24.073
Nothing yet.

03:24.073 --> 03:25.727
Listen, Trudy's noticed
how much you've been working.

03:25.727 --> 03:28.382
Don't worry, I'm not
putting in for the OT.

03:28.382 --> 03:29.818
When's the last time
you slept?

03:29.818 --> 03:31.428
In a bed?

03:31.428 --> 03:33.038
All right,
I'll take Sean tonight.

03:33.038 --> 03:34.562
No, it's okay. I got it.

05:21.756 --> 05:23.584
Victor Helms, his face
lit up in facial rec.

05:23.584 --> 05:25.803
He's indexed in just about
every system we got.

05:25.803 --> 05:28.284
Arrested for involuntary
sexual servitude,

05:28.284 --> 05:29.851
transport of a minor,

05:29.851 --> 05:31.809
enticement and harboring
of a child.

05:31.809 --> 05:34.334
He's slippery as hell.
Never been convicted.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.336
But all these arrests,
every single one

05:36.336 --> 05:37.815
tell the same story.

05:37.815 --> 05:40.688
This man right here
is sex trafficking children.

05:43.038 --> 05:46.346
He just met up
with Sean O'Neal an hour ago.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.782
They exchanged something.

05:47.782 --> 05:50.480
Bag's squared off, weighted.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.527
- It's got to be cash.
- Mm.

05:53.527 --> 05:55.442
This is it.

05:55.442 --> 05:56.660
Right?

05:58.358 --> 05:59.446
Yeah.

06:01.056 --> 06:02.144
All right.

06:02.144 --> 06:03.363
I'm gonna call in the team.

06:10.892 --> 06:13.285
Until this is over,
we all remain visible

06:13.285 --> 06:16.201
downstairs and up here,
like everything's normal.

06:16.201 --> 06:19.640
Trudy'll keep eyes
on the front gate like always.

06:19.640 --> 06:22.425
But if someone does
make it up here,

06:22.425 --> 06:24.209
this is what we're working on.

06:24.209 --> 06:25.515
My arts and crafts project.

06:25.515 --> 06:26.995
Operation Golden Triangle.

06:26.995 --> 06:29.258
A splinter cartel
with a new smuggling route,

06:29.258 --> 06:30.477
Durango to Chicago--

06:30.477 --> 06:32.827
all fake, just in case.

06:32.827 --> 06:35.438
All right, our real work,

06:35.438 --> 06:38.441
our real work lives here.

06:38.441 --> 06:43.533
Listen, we got to keep this in
the dark away from the chief.

06:43.533 --> 06:46.188
Everything's labeled
99 confidential.

06:46.188 --> 06:47.711
I've issued a bogus I-number.

06:47.711 --> 06:49.800
Anything you do
on any computer,

06:49.800 --> 06:53.108
you link it to that number.

06:53.108 --> 06:54.414
All right, hit it.

06:58.679 --> 07:00.550
Sean O'Neal, 32.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.596
Father, grandfather, both cops.

07:02.596 --> 07:04.902
Small sheet,
all low-grade drug stuff.

07:04.902 --> 07:07.514
He's an addict, sober now,
white knuckle sober.

07:09.472 --> 07:14.564
Victor Helms, 44, multiple
arrests, but no convictions.

07:14.564 --> 07:16.305
You name letters,
they've been after him--

07:16.305 --> 07:18.742
ISP, FBI, SIU.

07:18.742 --> 07:20.396
Two years ago,
he was indicted again,

07:20.396 --> 07:22.093
this time
for pimping out minors.

07:22.093 --> 07:24.008
But the case fell apart--
fruit of the poisonous tree.

07:24.008 --> 07:25.662
So he walked.

07:25.662 --> 07:27.185
Sean O'Neal is grooming girls
at Safe Place.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.057
He's got to be picking
junkies, runaways.

07:29.057 --> 07:30.711
Yeah, the ones
no one's looking for.

07:30.711 --> 07:32.626
Once he gets them
in that pipeline,

07:32.626 --> 07:34.889
my working theory is,
he sells them to Helms.

07:34.889 --> 07:37.195
Helms holds them,
runs them day to day,

07:37.195 --> 07:38.762
and then hires men
like Malcolm Kenning

07:38.762 --> 07:41.199
that we found with Abby
as an enforcer.

07:41.199 --> 07:43.114
Helms is running them.

07:43.114 --> 07:45.160
There'll be a property trail,
a place to hold them.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.946
Yeah, so we start
at the bottom.

07:48.946 --> 07:51.601
<i>Gonna work this just like
any narcotics case.</i>

07:51.601 --> 07:53.821
<i>We start low to go high.</i>

07:55.387 --> 07:57.433
<i>We need an in to Victor Helms.</i>

07:57.433 --> 08:00.958
<i>We nail Helms, we can get him
to flip for Sean O'Neal.</i>

08:00.958 --> 08:03.526
<i>So find me a lowlife,
someone who does business</i>

08:03.526 --> 08:05.963
<i>with these pricks,
a bottom feeder,</i>

08:05.963 --> 08:09.445
<i>someone who can get us close.</i>

08:09.445 --> 08:11.186
<i>All right, find me a name.</i>

08:14.015 --> 08:15.582
Hey.

08:15.582 --> 08:18.062
I got it. I got a name.

08:18.062 --> 08:19.803
Martin Daniels, 36.

08:19.803 --> 08:22.676
Man's buried deep
in Helms's recent case file,

08:22.676 --> 08:24.329
the one that got tossed.

08:24.329 --> 08:26.854
He was supposed to be
a protected grand jury witness.

08:26.854 --> 08:28.333
He gave a sworn depo
in exchange

08:28.333 --> 08:30.684
for his own solicitation
charges being dropped.

08:30.684 --> 08:31.946
Yeah, he's a john.

08:31.946 --> 08:33.643
Who operated
in Helms's circle.

08:33.643 --> 08:34.818
He has an online handle.

08:34.818 --> 08:36.124
I mean, he changed the name,

08:36.124 --> 08:37.821
but he kept
the same IP address.

08:37.821 --> 08:39.606
"RustAndStardust"?

08:39.606 --> 08:41.172
A "Lolita" reference.

08:43.348 --> 08:44.654
All right.

08:44.654 --> 08:46.569
So let's set the bait.

08:46.569 --> 08:49.180
We find a rookie cop
who fits the part.

08:49.180 --> 08:50.617
Just step light.

08:50.617 --> 08:51.792
Let's move.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.845
If Daniels gets
too close to her,

09:01.845 --> 09:03.325
he's gonna know she's not 17.

09:03.325 --> 09:06.371
Sure, but we've got
his messages to her,

09:06.371 --> 09:08.025
requests for specific sex acts.

09:08.025 --> 09:10.027
Really, we just need him
to drop the cash and we move.

09:11.855 --> 09:14.597
This whole case is
relying on a brand-new PPO.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.860
Yeah, but Torres
vouched for her.

09:16.860 --> 09:18.035
We're good, Hailey.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.387
Is this what's been
keeping you out

09:22.387 --> 09:23.345
of the district, this case?

09:25.956 --> 09:28.263
I don't mean to--you just--

09:28.263 --> 09:30.047
you seem worn down.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.135
Sorry.

09:34.269 --> 09:36.401
It's all right.

09:36.401 --> 09:42.146
Yeah, I--I've been tailing
Sean since Abby's case.

09:42.146 --> 09:43.191
Oh.

09:44.888 --> 09:48.631
I haven't gone home
in a while.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.067
I haven't really wanted to.

09:52.940 --> 09:54.594
<i>All right, look alive.
I got the car.</i>

09:59.729 --> 10:01.383
<i>Gray SUV with Indiana plates.</i>

10:01.383 --> 10:04.081
<i>Todd, Mary, Paul, 382.</i>

10:04.081 --> 10:05.430
All right.

10:05.430 --> 10:08.216
Plates check out. It's him.

10:08.216 --> 10:10.348
Got a positive on Daniels.
Castillo, you good?

10:10.348 --> 10:11.741
<i>I'm good.</i>

10:11.741 --> 10:14.048
<i>Ready to go.</i>
- Copy you.

10:14.048 --> 10:15.571
All right, Kim, you're on.

10:22.099 --> 10:23.057
Text sent.

10:33.894 --> 10:35.765
Okay, he's on the move.

10:48.778 --> 10:50.475
Headed up the stairs now.

11:03.358 --> 11:04.272
He's in.

11:06.448 --> 11:09.364
<i>Hi, Amelia.</i>

11:14.282 --> 11:15.283
<i>Don't!</i>

11:17.720 --> 11:19.635
<i>I like it dark.</i>

11:19.635 --> 11:20.723
<i>I get shy.</i>

11:23.639 --> 11:25.641
<i>What do you want to do?</i>

11:25.641 --> 11:27.904
<i>Everything.</i>

11:27.904 --> 11:29.427
<i>Everything gets
pretty expensive.</i>

11:29.427 --> 11:33.170
<i>Yeah, but some things
are worth paying for.</i>

11:33.170 --> 11:34.868
Daniels just pulled out
his wallet.

11:41.222 --> 11:43.267
<i>Are you trying to play
some kind of game with me?</i>

11:43.267 --> 11:44.268
<i>What?</i>

11:44.268 --> 11:45.835
Kim, do we have
a cash exchange?

11:45.835 --> 11:47.532
No cash, no go word. Hold.

11:47.532 --> 11:50.710
<i>How old are you, Amelia?</i>

11:50.710 --> 11:51.841
Oh, no.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.364
<i>How old do you want me
to be?</i>

11:53.364 --> 11:55.018
<i>I want you to be as old
as I was promised,</i>

11:55.018 --> 11:57.891
<i>as old as I am paying for!</i>

11:57.891 --> 12:00.154
<i>I am. I can be that old.</i>

12:04.593 --> 12:05.507
Damn it.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.383
<i>I'm only giving you half.</i>

12:12.383 --> 12:14.298
<i>- That's fine.</i>
- We got cash!

12:14.298 --> 12:15.909
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

12:17.040 --> 12:19.608
<i>That's fine?</i>

12:19.608 --> 12:20.783
<i>What do you mean, that's fine?</i>

12:20.783 --> 12:22.524
<i>Who are you?
- Hey, stay right there!</i>

12:22.524 --> 12:23.786
<i>Hey.</i>

12:23.786 --> 12:25.092
Marty.

12:25.092 --> 12:26.397
Take it easy there, Marty.
We're police.

12:26.397 --> 12:27.703
- Chicago PD!
- Keep your hands up!

12:27.703 --> 12:28.660
Slow down. Hey!

12:28.660 --> 12:30.358
Hey! Whoa!

12:32.316 --> 12:33.274
Jeez.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.452
No. No!

12:37.452 --> 12:39.541
You're done.
Hands behind your back.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.717
Don't move! Stop moving! Stop!

12:41.717 --> 12:43.284
Put your hands
behind your back.

12:49.246 --> 12:51.640
You did business
with Victor Helms, Marty.

12:51.640 --> 12:54.121
You admitted that years ago.
- But not anymore.

12:54.121 --> 12:57.124
That's what I'm saying.

12:57.124 --> 12:59.169
Not anymore.

12:59.169 --> 13:00.736
I don't talk to him.

13:00.736 --> 13:04.218
I don't--I don't know
how to get a hold of him.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.309
I know.

13:08.309 --> 13:09.614
I got issues.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.225
Like getting mad
when they're over 17?

13:11.225 --> 13:13.967
No.

13:13.967 --> 13:14.968
I'm doing better.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.970
Mm-hmm, yeah, you are.

13:16.970 --> 13:19.450
I see that they made you
deacon at the church,

13:19.450 --> 13:23.324
real pillar of the community.

13:23.324 --> 13:25.456
Got yourself married
and everything.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.850
Some pretty nasty language
you used to get our officer

13:27.850 --> 13:28.895
into bed with you, Marty.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.287
You talk to your wife
like that?

13:33.377 --> 13:34.857
I wonder how she
would feel if she

13:34.857 --> 13:37.686
saw these messages,
or your pastor,

13:37.686 --> 13:40.863
your boss, everyone you know.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.824
What do you want from me?

13:44.824 --> 13:46.564
I want Victor Helms.

13:48.740 --> 13:53.702
You know, you don't get
what you're walking into.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.747
The guy's paranoid now, okay?

13:57.706 --> 14:00.100
He sells kids, young kids.

14:00.100 --> 14:03.407
And he knows the cops are
gonna find him someday.

14:06.758 --> 14:10.066
You don't just walk in
and make a purchase.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.807
He's not a used car salesman.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.374
I know.

14:13.374 --> 14:15.767
That's why you're
gonna walk us in.

14:18.248 --> 14:20.207
I can't.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.579
Okay.

14:44.579 --> 14:45.885
Ruz is in the pocket.

14:48.713 --> 14:50.367
<i>Hey, just calm down.</i>

14:50.367 --> 14:52.282
It's just a meet,

14:52.282 --> 14:54.676
just making friends, all right?

15:01.639 --> 15:04.077
We've got a Lexus sedan
pulling up, tinted windows.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.527
Here we go.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.485
Hey, Ruz, Victor's coming in
through the side door.

15:21.485 --> 15:22.922
He's here.

15:27.404 --> 15:29.711
Hi, Vic.

15:29.711 --> 15:31.931
It's been a long time, Marty.

15:37.153 --> 15:38.328
You look terrible.

15:40.548 --> 15:42.550
Where you been?

15:42.550 --> 15:47.685
I--just trying to be better.

15:47.685 --> 15:49.426
That's working out for you?

15:52.603 --> 15:54.127
This your friend?

15:54.127 --> 15:55.824
Yeah.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.652
Looking to start
a new relationship.

15:57.652 --> 15:58.609
Marty said you're the
man to talk--

15:58.609 --> 16:00.524
You have ID on you?

16:00.524 --> 16:04.267
Oh, come on, man.
You don't need to see my name.

16:04.267 --> 16:06.617
You just need
to see cash, right?

16:06.617 --> 16:08.315
I'll show you cash.

16:08.315 --> 16:09.533
That's very dramatic.

16:13.581 --> 16:15.452
What do you think
you're buying?

16:15.452 --> 16:17.585
Oh, I don't know.

16:17.585 --> 16:19.935
Something as young
and as sweet as I can.

16:19.935 --> 16:21.415
Mm.

16:24.896 --> 16:28.030
Got to hit the head. Wait here.

16:38.388 --> 16:39.607
Who the hell is that?

16:39.607 --> 16:40.782
I don't know.

16:47.354 --> 16:48.703
Wait.

16:48.703 --> 16:50.400
Hey, Ruz,
Victor brought a girl with him.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.185
<i>She's coming your way.</i>

16:52.185 --> 16:53.447
Son of a bitch.

17:02.412 --> 17:04.806
<i>Gonna make a girl
pull out her own seat?</i>

17:17.949 --> 17:19.342
I like this.

17:19.342 --> 17:20.387
Yeah?

17:20.387 --> 17:23.564
Spiky.

17:23.564 --> 17:26.436
My friend said
you were real nice.

17:26.436 --> 17:31.224
Helms sent her in as a decoy,
Adam, to see if you're a cop.

17:31.224 --> 17:32.703
It's your call.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.140
<i>Said we should spend
some time together.</i>

17:34.140 --> 17:36.577
We call it too early,
we're dead in the water.

17:36.577 --> 17:38.535
We lose O'Neal, the case.

17:38.535 --> 17:40.276
We can always track her.
We won't lose her.

17:40.276 --> 17:43.323
Hailey, it's his call.

17:43.323 --> 17:44.889
Your friend doesn't know me.

17:44.889 --> 17:47.240
He doesn't know whether
I'm nice or not.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.111
You seem nice to me.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.071
Let's have some fun.

17:53.724 --> 17:55.117
I don't know, honey,

17:55.117 --> 17:56.553
you seem like you're
a few drinks in front of me.

17:56.553 --> 17:58.164
Then drink up.

18:00.470 --> 18:04.387
Okay, nah, nah, I'm just here
to talk some business, okay?

18:04.387 --> 18:05.649
Me too.

18:12.874 --> 18:15.224
Come on. I gotcha.
Let's get you up.

18:15.224 --> 18:17.922
You okay?

18:17.922 --> 18:19.315
Sit down.

18:19.315 --> 18:21.796
Hey. You all right?

18:24.755 --> 18:26.975
What'd you do to her?

18:26.975 --> 18:28.063
She--she fell.

18:30.326 --> 18:31.806
This is what we're doing?

18:31.806 --> 18:33.503
You're testing me with a girl
so drunk, she can't walk?

18:33.503 --> 18:34.548
That's what I'm
paying good money for?

18:43.557 --> 18:44.645
You can't even
get this right?

18:44.645 --> 18:45.907
- No.
- You're worthless.

18:45.907 --> 18:47.169
<i>- Ow, Victor.
- Trash.</i>

18:47.169 --> 18:48.649
I'd kill you if it meant
anything to anyone.

18:48.649 --> 18:50.216
Hey.
Chicago PD, man. Back up.

18:50.216 --> 18:53.088
- No. Wait, wait, wait.
- It's all right. Stand back.

18:53.088 --> 18:55.569
- Ugh!
- Victor!

18:55.569 --> 18:56.700
There's Daniels.

19:00.182 --> 19:02.402
Helms went out the back.
He's on the run.

19:02.402 --> 19:04.317
- I got Daniels.
- Okay.

19:09.974 --> 19:11.672
Chicago PD! Get your hands up!
- Police!

19:11.672 --> 19:13.630
Torres, hold your fire!

19:15.154 --> 19:17.721
There's nowhere to go, Victor.
Drop your weapon.

19:17.721 --> 19:20.028
Victor, just put it down.

19:20.028 --> 19:21.203
Come on, Victor.

19:21.203 --> 19:23.336
Put it down.

19:23.336 --> 19:24.989
No!

19:24.989 --> 19:27.557
Ugh!

19:27.557 --> 19:29.516
Tell me. Tell me how it works.
- Shots fired by the police.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.692
Sean O'Neal, right,
Sean O'Neal gives them to you?

19:31.692 --> 19:33.215
Where are the other girls?
Where are they?

19:33.215 --> 19:34.347
Come on. Hey! Look at me.

19:34.347 --> 19:35.478
How does it work?

19:35.478 --> 19:37.654
Does Sean O'Neal
sell them to you?

19:37.654 --> 19:38.786
Is that what it is?

19:38.786 --> 19:40.309
Hey, come on!

19:40.309 --> 19:41.702
Come on, Victor!

19:41.702 --> 19:42.659
Do something good
in your useless life.

19:42.659 --> 19:45.314
Is that what it is?

19:45.314 --> 19:46.359
I know there's other girls.

19:46.359 --> 19:47.490
Where are they?

19:47.490 --> 19:48.491
Victor.

19:48.491 --> 19:49.536
Come on, Victor.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.233
Where are the other girls?

19:51.233 --> 19:52.278
Come on, Victor!

19:55.368 --> 19:57.152
Damn it!

20:17.259 --> 20:19.261
I used to sober up my dad.

20:23.134 --> 20:24.875
I just want you to know
you're safe here.

20:24.875 --> 20:27.487
Okay?

20:27.487 --> 20:31.055
We're gonna help you.
We're gonna do anything we can.

20:31.055 --> 20:33.319
And you're not in any trouble.

20:33.319 --> 20:36.191
You're just a child.
You've done nothing wrong.

20:38.846 --> 20:41.718
My real name is Amber Bero.

20:41.718 --> 20:43.111
Go ahead.

20:43.111 --> 20:45.069
Look it up.

20:45.069 --> 20:47.376
I'm not a child. I'm 18.

20:49.639 --> 20:52.947
And I wasn't forced to do
anything or be with anyone.

20:55.428 --> 20:57.256
I don't need your help.

20:59.606 --> 21:03.740
Okay, well, you are 18
and two weeks.

21:03.740 --> 21:06.265
So I don't think you were 18
when you met Victor.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.005
What were you, 15, 16?

21:08.005 --> 21:09.311
18.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.879
You want this life?

21:11.879 --> 21:13.141
Maybe.

21:13.141 --> 21:14.316
What if I'm good at it?

21:14.316 --> 21:15.491
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

21:15.491 --> 21:17.276
I think you're good
at surviving.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.973
But you really think
you're gonna want this

21:18.973 --> 21:20.801
five, ten years from now?

21:20.801 --> 21:22.237
What then?

21:22.237 --> 21:24.457
There are other girls
out there, Amber.

21:24.457 --> 21:28.591
Girls who are being hurt
right now, who've disappeared.

21:28.591 --> 21:31.028
And if you can't lift
a finger to protect them,

21:31.028 --> 21:32.508
but you are willing
to go to the mat

21:32.508 --> 21:34.467
for the men who did this
to them...

21:34.467 --> 21:36.207
There's nothing noble
about that.

21:37.818 --> 21:41.212
That's shameful.

21:41.212 --> 21:42.736
Safe Place Oasis,

21:42.736 --> 21:44.346
it's a youth center
in Grand Crossing.

21:44.346 --> 21:46.479
You ever been there?

21:50.265 --> 21:52.311
What about Sean O'Neal?
You know him?

21:56.010 --> 21:57.664
Abby Jacobs?

22:01.842 --> 22:04.366
She jumped off a roof
two weeks ago.

22:08.022 --> 22:11.330
I told her Sean was coming
to take care of her.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.635
So she jumped.

22:18.511 --> 22:21.296
Sean did something
to her, didn't he?

22:21.296 --> 22:24.038
He sold her to Victor.

22:24.038 --> 22:25.256
That's what's happening.

22:38.052 --> 22:40.663
Michelle Wheeler,

22:40.663 --> 22:42.883
Tina Chan,

22:42.883 --> 22:45.407
Sarah Ramsey,

22:45.407 --> 22:48.889
Emma Jackson, same story.

22:48.889 --> 22:52.545
All of them met Sean,
went to Safe Place,

22:52.545 --> 22:54.851
and now they're all gone.

22:58.551 --> 23:01.292
So what's the plan then, huh?

23:01.292 --> 23:04.295
Victor's dead.
Did you know that?

23:04.295 --> 23:07.081
There's no one
for you to protect,

23:07.081 --> 23:08.169
no one to run you.

23:08.169 --> 23:09.910
No one runs me.

23:17.004 --> 23:19.310
How did you get those scars?

23:19.310 --> 23:21.225
I had them since I was a kid.

23:21.225 --> 23:22.662
I don't even remember.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.236
Birdie knows Sean,
knows how he's involved.

23:32.236 --> 23:34.369
She came up through Safe Place,
too, just like Abby did.

23:34.369 --> 23:35.849
She's got the same scars
on her feet.

23:35.849 --> 23:38.547
Yeah, but we got
no evidence of any of that.

23:38.547 --> 23:40.549
And there's no record
she went through Safe Place,

23:40.549 --> 23:41.985
never even met Sean.

23:41.985 --> 23:43.204
Then we keep squeezing her.

23:43.204 --> 23:44.640
We find another way
for her to help us.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.163
She doesn't have to help us.

23:46.163 --> 23:48.470
She didn't do anything
illegal in that bar, Hail.

23:48.470 --> 23:49.906
Then there's got
to be something else.

23:49.906 --> 23:51.430
What about Victor Helms'
cell phone?

23:51.430 --> 23:53.040
Uh-uh,
the GPS was disconnected,

23:53.040 --> 23:54.781
and there's no other girls
on his tech.

23:54.781 --> 23:56.739
And none of it links to Sean.

23:56.739 --> 23:58.219
48's almost up.

23:58.219 --> 23:59.873
I can't keep them much longer.

24:01.657 --> 24:03.746
What?
- Nothing.

24:03.746 --> 24:05.269
There was
a sex trafficking victim

24:05.269 --> 24:06.880
standing in front of me, Hailey.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.621
Her pimp's hand was around
her throat, so I did something.

24:08.621 --> 24:10.318
- I know.
- And I'd do it again tomorrow.

24:10.318 --> 24:12.407
- I said I know.
- All right, enough.

24:12.407 --> 24:14.931
Look, we don't have it.

24:14.931 --> 24:16.455
We don't.

24:20.067 --> 24:21.677
All right. Release Birdie.

24:21.677 --> 24:23.244
We can't release her.

24:23.244 --> 24:24.985
If the chief is reading our
reports, we don't have time!

24:24.985 --> 24:26.508
Hailey.

24:29.816 --> 24:31.034
Come on outside.

24:31.034 --> 24:32.340
- There's got to be something--
- Come on.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.564
Damn it.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.051
I get it, okay?

24:48.051 --> 24:50.010
We'll release Birdie.
I'll keep tailing her.

24:50.010 --> 24:51.490
You can't do it this way.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.666
What does that mean?

24:53.666 --> 24:56.059
You gotta turn the heat down.

24:56.059 --> 24:58.714
You gotta go home at night.
You gotta sleep.

24:58.714 --> 25:01.630
Probably gotta deal with
what's going on in your life.

25:01.630 --> 25:03.284
What?
This has nothing to do with me.

25:03.284 --> 25:05.808
Hailey.

25:05.808 --> 25:09.116
You want to save something
too badly right now.

25:11.814 --> 25:13.773
Okay.

25:13.773 --> 25:15.601
Maybe I do.

25:15.601 --> 25:16.863
Why is that wrong?

25:18.604 --> 25:21.607
You're telling me you don't
want something to save?

25:26.394 --> 25:29.136
Just go home, okay?

25:29.136 --> 25:30.703
The others can release Birdie.

25:33.009 --> 25:34.489
Just take a break.

26:01.385 --> 26:03.039
Hailey.

26:03.039 --> 26:04.563
Hey.

26:08.915 --> 26:11.265
I was just about to close up.
You want a coffee or something?

26:11.265 --> 26:12.309
Sure. I mean, I'm a cop.

26:12.309 --> 26:14.485
I'm obligated to say yes
to that.

26:14.485 --> 26:15.791
Right, don't tell
my dad I forgot, okay?

26:19.447 --> 26:23.625
It must be so rewarding,
doing what you do.

26:23.625 --> 26:28.151
Oh, boy.
The good days, yeah.

26:28.151 --> 26:29.500
What are you doing here?

26:33.548 --> 26:37.334
You said something
to me before,

26:37.334 --> 26:41.034
how you could see
that I was in pain.

26:43.950 --> 26:45.821
And--thanks.

26:48.171 --> 26:50.957
That's old.

26:54.482 --> 26:55.396
You were right.

26:58.138 --> 27:02.098
I know your dad told you
about my husband leaving.

27:04.144 --> 27:06.625
He decided that
he lost who he was,

27:06.625 --> 27:08.017
and he had to go.

27:11.368 --> 27:13.632
Somewhere in Latin America.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.851
I can't get a hold of him.

27:15.851 --> 27:18.245
Can't go home either, so.

27:20.247 --> 27:23.380
I don't know.
I can't stand being home.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.254
Yeah.

27:29.256 --> 27:32.607
When my mom died, my dad
moved us to a one-bedroom

27:32.607 --> 27:35.958
in Bridgeport like that.

27:35.958 --> 27:39.092
He said the whole house
smelled like her.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.096
I mean, I kind of
liked the smell.

27:46.447 --> 27:50.407
I think not being able
to go home is...

27:50.407 --> 27:53.149
the most natural thing
in the world.

27:56.239 --> 27:59.416
But why did you come here?

28:02.985 --> 28:04.595
Do you mind if I sit?

28:04.595 --> 28:05.771
Please.

28:12.647 --> 28:19.436
Um, I can't stop
thinking about her, Abby.

28:21.177 --> 28:23.440
Everything that happened,
I just--

28:23.440 --> 28:25.355
I just--I can't.

28:25.355 --> 28:27.749
I haven't stopped
working the case.

28:27.749 --> 28:28.750
Good.

28:35.235 --> 28:38.020
Have you found anything?

28:38.020 --> 28:39.630
I don't know. Maybe.

28:39.630 --> 28:45.158
There was a name
that came up, but I--

28:45.158 --> 28:46.463
Victor Helms.

28:48.465 --> 28:52.774
Uh, look,
I know this is a long shot,

28:52.774 --> 28:54.863
but do you recognize this guy?

28:54.863 --> 28:56.604
Does he come
around here at all?

28:58.824 --> 29:00.129
Oh, maybe.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.480
God, maybe.

29:03.480 --> 29:07.963
There's guys that hang
around here looking for girls.

29:07.963 --> 29:09.312
I scare them off.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.228
Anything on this guy?

29:12.228 --> 29:14.056
I mean, where he works,
what he's into?

29:14.056 --> 29:15.754
Anything at all?

29:17.668 --> 29:18.582
I wish I did.

29:20.715 --> 29:23.326
I wish I did, Hailey.
I'm sorry.

29:23.326 --> 29:25.328
That's all right.

29:25.328 --> 29:27.809
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have come here.

29:27.809 --> 29:31.944
No, I'm glad you came.

29:31.944 --> 29:36.557
Please come back any time,
any time you want to talk.

29:38.211 --> 29:41.170
Believe me, I get pain.

29:41.170 --> 29:44.173
All right.

29:44.173 --> 29:50.397
I have lived alone
with pain my whole life.

29:51.702 --> 29:53.226
But there's a better way.

29:57.186 --> 29:59.493
Thanks, Sean.
I appreciate that.

30:01.364 --> 30:03.758
All right, I'll see you.

30:03.758 --> 30:05.194
Hope so.

30:27.782 --> 30:28.696
Come on, come on.

30:50.544 --> 30:51.501
Gotcha.

30:57.943 --> 30:59.683
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:59.683 --> 31:00.902
Voight here?

31:00.902 --> 31:03.252
I haven't seen him.

31:03.252 --> 31:05.167
What are you
still doing here?

31:05.167 --> 31:07.474
I'm just trying
to find another way in.

31:10.651 --> 31:13.306
Look, man,
I'm sorry about earlier.

31:13.306 --> 31:15.786
I sh--I, uh--

31:15.786 --> 31:16.962
you did the right thing.

31:16.962 --> 31:18.354
And I shouldn't have
implied otherwise.

31:18.354 --> 31:19.921
I'm really sorry.
I'm just--

31:19.921 --> 31:21.314
Hey.

31:21.314 --> 31:22.924
I get it, I do.

31:22.924 --> 31:24.186
No worries at all.

31:26.319 --> 31:27.929
I think I got something.

31:27.929 --> 31:28.887
Thank God.

31:30.976 --> 31:32.107
You tickled the wire?

31:32.107 --> 31:34.457
Yeah, and it worked.

31:34.457 --> 31:35.894
I mentioned Victor.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.505
A minute after I left,
Sean made a phone call.

31:38.505 --> 31:39.854
Victor's cell phone lit up.

31:39.854 --> 31:41.508
I mean, he was probably
calling to find out

31:41.508 --> 31:44.424
what the hell was going on,
but now we have his burner.

31:44.424 --> 31:47.296
- Did Sean make you?
- No.

31:47.296 --> 31:49.516
All right, why'd you
tell him you were there?

31:54.434 --> 31:56.610
I told him I was in pain,
that I missed my husband.

31:56.610 --> 31:58.438
I was a mess,
and I was obsessing over Abby.

32:01.223 --> 32:02.137
He didn't make me.

32:02.137 --> 32:03.660
He didn't.

32:03.660 --> 32:04.705
I would know.

32:06.359 --> 32:08.187
Sarge, this is new.
This is real.

32:08.187 --> 32:09.710
And we're running out of time.

32:09.710 --> 32:12.191
All right,
so call in the team.

32:12.191 --> 32:13.932
The burner was
fictitiously registered,

32:13.932 --> 32:17.413
activated on a public
IP address at the library.

32:17.413 --> 32:19.372
- Security footage?
- Scanned it all.

32:19.372 --> 32:20.982
It's a dry well,
probably activated

32:20.982 --> 32:22.027
outside the building.

32:22.027 --> 32:23.419
We'd need a Wire Act warrant

32:23.419 --> 32:25.508
to confirm Sean's ownership
to the burner.

32:25.508 --> 32:27.293
But in order to get that--
- We'd give ourselves away.

32:27.293 --> 32:29.382
Chief would have to sign off.
We'd have to ID the target.

32:29.382 --> 32:31.340
But the ping order's
attached to a phone,

32:31.340 --> 32:32.602
not to a person.

32:32.602 --> 32:33.864
And this phone
is a gold mine.

32:33.864 --> 32:37.085
Tower pings, outgoing calls,
roaming data.

32:37.085 --> 32:41.611
We got something.

32:41.611 --> 32:43.962
So we cross-referenced pings
from Victor Helms's phone

32:43.962 --> 32:45.485
to Sean O'Neal's burner.

32:45.485 --> 32:47.356
They've both been at this
location down near Frankfurt.

32:47.356 --> 32:49.750
- What's that address?
- 5700 Steger.

32:49.750 --> 32:51.404
Helms has spent
a lot of time there.

32:51.404 --> 32:53.014
Malcolm Kenning's cell
hit there too.

32:53.014 --> 32:55.190
It's old Salvation Army houses,
abandoned years ago.

32:55.190 --> 32:58.846
It's owned by an LLC,
an LLC with a lot of shells.

32:58.846 --> 33:00.326
Mm-hmm, we went all
the way down there.

33:00.326 --> 33:02.110
We took a peek.

33:02.110 --> 33:03.894
This place is a fortress.

33:03.894 --> 33:06.027
There's cameras everywhere,
even in the bushes.

33:06.027 --> 33:07.811
Platt's got two friendly
tact guys down there,

33:07.811 --> 33:09.639
they're keeping eyes,
no movement yet,

33:09.639 --> 33:11.163
but as soon as
they know something, we will.

33:11.163 --> 33:13.469
That is some
real nice equipment.

33:13.469 --> 33:15.819
Big money.
That is not this neighborhood.

33:15.819 --> 33:18.866
Sarge, that's where
they're holding them.

33:18.866 --> 33:20.259
There's kids in there.

33:26.047 --> 33:27.788
I don't understand
what I'm looking at.

33:27.788 --> 33:29.007
We think this location

33:29.007 --> 33:31.357
is being used
for sex trafficking.

33:31.357 --> 33:33.054
And I got reason
to believe there are girls

33:33.054 --> 33:34.490
being held there right now.

33:34.490 --> 33:36.666
And you found this location
by lifting data

33:36.666 --> 33:37.928
off a burner phone?

33:37.928 --> 33:39.843
- We did.
- Who owns the burner?

33:39.843 --> 33:41.845
Who's the target
of your investigation?

33:48.113 --> 33:51.681
Hank, I wouldn't sign a
search warrant without a name.

33:51.681 --> 33:53.770
You're asking me
for a no-knock,

33:53.770 --> 33:56.773
to let you bring in tact,
juvenile detectives,

33:56.773 --> 33:58.384
ambulances, DCFS?

33:58.384 --> 33:59.472
This is a massive order.

33:59.472 --> 34:01.126
Look, Nina,

34:01.126 --> 34:02.692
the last time I came to you,

34:02.692 --> 34:05.913
I asked you for a co-sign
on Javier Escano.

34:05.913 --> 34:07.523
It was the biggest
narcotics seizure

34:07.523 --> 34:08.829
in the history of the city.

34:08.829 --> 34:11.092
It got you this office,
nice view.

34:11.092 --> 34:12.789
Are you saying
I owe you something?

34:12.789 --> 34:17.707
No, I'm saying
I was good for it then,

34:17.707 --> 34:20.058
and I am good for it now.

34:41.905 --> 34:42.993
All right, let's move.

35:00.576 --> 35:01.882
Mm-hmm.

35:14.416 --> 35:15.852
Breach.

35:29.214 --> 35:30.128
Hmm.

35:32.782 --> 35:34.132
All U, let's move.

35:36.177 --> 35:36.960
Jeez.

36:20.656 --> 36:23.442
We're too late.

36:23.442 --> 36:25.226
They're all gone.

36:35.541 --> 36:38.152
Hey, let's bring it in.

36:43.636 --> 36:45.594
All right, someone tell me
we got something.

36:45.594 --> 36:48.031
All I can tell you is that
they cleared out all the tech,

36:48.031 --> 36:50.120
ripped everything
out the damn walls.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.992
Based on the wiring,
there were a ton of computers

36:51.992 --> 36:53.994
and servers in there,
but all these cameras

36:53.994 --> 36:55.430
connect to nothing now.

36:55.430 --> 36:57.171
Any of that DNA evidence
would be on those sheets,

36:57.171 --> 36:58.955
so they removed them.

36:58.955 --> 37:00.783
Wiped everything else down
with bleach.

37:00.783 --> 37:02.002
How recently?

37:02.002 --> 37:05.223
Techs say 24, maybe 48 hours.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.528
They weren't
holding them here.

37:06.528 --> 37:08.313
This is where they
brought them for sex.

37:08.313 --> 37:10.140
Must have been johns
coming and going.

37:10.140 --> 37:12.317
Yes, but they chose
this spot for a good reason.

37:12.317 --> 37:15.450
There's no traffic cams,
no PODs in the area.

37:15.450 --> 37:18.192
So we have nothing linking
Sean O'Neal to this place,

37:18.192 --> 37:20.063
except for the tower pings
from his burner.

37:20.063 --> 37:22.588
Which we don't
legally know is his.

37:22.588 --> 37:24.546
How the hell did they know
we were coming?

37:26.331 --> 37:27.593
I would have known
if Sean made me.

37:27.593 --> 37:28.855
I would have felt it.

37:28.855 --> 37:30.726
Hailey, I don't think he did.

37:54.533 --> 37:58.101
The tricks you used,

37:58.101 --> 38:01.191
the 99 confidentials,
the fake I-numbers,

38:01.191 --> 38:04.238
I've used them myself.

38:04.238 --> 38:08.111
I read your reports after
the officer-involved shooting.

38:08.111 --> 38:09.591
I read between the lines.

38:11.941 --> 38:14.901
He's my kid.

38:14.901 --> 38:16.337
Hank, he's my son.

38:18.557 --> 38:21.734
But me and you,
we came up together.

38:21.734 --> 38:24.911
And you have never had a better
friend in the ivory tower.

38:24.911 --> 38:26.391
I have been good to you.

38:26.391 --> 38:28.915
I cannot understand why you
wouldn't just come to me.

38:28.915 --> 38:32.527
What, you think I don't know
that my son has a problem?

38:32.527 --> 38:34.094
A problem?

38:34.094 --> 38:36.096
I know when Sean is clean.

38:36.096 --> 38:37.967
I know when he's not.

38:37.967 --> 38:40.013
Sean's not using,
not right now,

38:40.013 --> 38:41.754
and God willing,
never again, but--

38:41.754 --> 38:43.190
Patty.

38:43.190 --> 38:44.365
My son's doing
goddamn great, Hank.

38:44.365 --> 38:47.063
Patty.

38:47.063 --> 38:48.456
What?

38:54.375 --> 38:56.682
I'm not investigating Sean
for drugs.

38:59.728 --> 39:03.515
I'm investigating him
for sex trafficking--

39:03.515 --> 39:05.168
minors.

39:10.043 --> 39:11.697
- What?
- Children.

39:15.483 --> 39:17.703
Come on, what the hell
are you talking about?

39:20.401 --> 39:22.098
No, my son's dedicated
his whole life

39:22.098 --> 39:23.665
to helping children.

39:25.711 --> 39:27.582
This is my--this is my son.

39:27.582 --> 39:29.149
This is my child!

39:29.149 --> 39:31.673
This is my blood!
How dare you?
