stay in a person's system?

00:16.450 --> 00:17.885
- What's your name?
- Trouble.

00:17.920 --> 00:20.190
That was my mom's name.
I don't like that.

00:20.225 --> 00:23.830
- Snort this, 5-0, and show us
you ain't a cop. - I refuse.

00:25.435 --> 00:28.973
I admit I've been smoking
marijuana for medicinal purposes.

I never had the guts to try out
for "The New Yorker" before,

01:30.844 --> 01:32.979
but now I'm ready.

01:33.014 --> 01:34.983
Is this magazine still around?

01:35.017 --> 01:38.755
Of course. Anyway, I think
I can win this contest.

01:38.789 --> 01:40.691
I'm going to turn
my cases into stories,

01:40.725 --> 01:42.861
but I need to come up
with a heroic alter ego.

01:42.896 --> 01:46.332
- Like you did with Super Ray.
- I have a new alter alter ego:

01:46.367 --> 01:48.967
- Kevin Bacon.
- What do you mean Kevin Bacon?

01:49.001 --> 01:52.301
He emailed me this morning.
Somehow he saw "The Birth of Super Ray."

01:52.335 --> 01:56.370
He wants to meet tonight.
He thinks he can option it for like $10,000.

01:56.404 --> 01:58.905
My God, this is huge!
He wants to play Super Ray?

01:58.940 --> 02:01.807
Yes. He thinks it can finally
be his big franchise character.

02:01.841 --> 02:04.275
Kind of like a drunken
Batman with a big cock.

02:04.310 --> 02:06.211
This is amazing.
I love Kevin Bacon.

02:06.245 --> 02:08.413
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

02:08.447 --> 02:10.782
Oh, it's George.
I've got to grab this real quick.

02:10.816 --> 02:12.951
I'm gonna get some more iced coffee.
It's free refills.

02:12.985 --> 02:14.586
- Hello, George?
- Hey, Jonathan.

02:14.620 --> 02:17.389
I'm just calling to confirm...
8:30, your class, right?

02:17.423 --> 02:19.557
Yes, and you can talk about
whatever you want.

02:19.591 --> 02:21.391
It... you know,
writing related.

02:21.426 --> 02:24.361
Oh, I'm gonna give a good talk, I promise.
I'm feeling very inspired.

02:24.395 --> 02:27.196
I just wrote what might be
my best column ever.

02:27.231 --> 02:28.931
Oh, that's wonderful.

02:28.966 --> 02:30.933
Oh hey, gotta go.
I got another call coming in.

02:30.967 --> 02:32.768
- Hello?
- Hello.

02:32.802 --> 02:35.737
<i>- Hello, who's this?
- Hello, George?</i>

02:35.771 --> 02:39.473
<i>George?</i>

02:40.776 --> 02:42.176
Thank you.

02:42.210 --> 02:45.012
Oh my God, you just
spilled coffee on my baby!

02:45.046 --> 02:47.781
I'm so... I'm so sorry! It's iced coffee.
It's just iced coffee.

02:47.815 --> 02:50.549
- Oh my God, this is terrible.
- I think you should call the police.

02:50.584 --> 02:52.317
Are you crazy?
It's just iced coffee.

02:52.351 --> 02:54.018
I had much worse things happen
to me when I was a kid.

02:54.052 --> 02:56.553
<i>- It's fine. - Don't tell
me how my child is doing!</i>

02:56.587 --> 02:58.922
<i>Are you okay, sweetie?</i>

02:58.956 --> 03:00.890
Can I get another
refill, please?

03:00.925 --> 03:02.759
I'm sorry.
Ow, ck!

03:05.695 --> 03:08.196
Wow, I've never been
86'd from a cafe.

03:08.231 --> 03:10.932
Screw those Brooklyn moms.
I hate women.

03:10.967 --> 03:13.801
Really? What about the
new woman you're dating?

03:13.836 --> 03:15.636
Oh, I gotta break up with her.

03:15.670 --> 03:18.138
She's paranoid,
needy and jealous.

03:18.173 --> 03:20.808
All of which make her good in
bed, but the rest of the time

03:20.842 --> 03:23.410
- it is hell.
- Man, that does sound bad.

03:23.445 --> 03:25.579
She also hacked
into my email account

03:25.613 --> 03:27.147
and put her picture
on my phone.

03:27.181 --> 03:29.449
Everytime I make a call
I have to see her face.

03:30.750 --> 03:32.717
Oh my God, that's Jennifer Gladwell.
I know her!

03:32.752 --> 03:35.186
- Brooklyn is so small.
- Wait, how do you know her?

03:35.220 --> 03:37.555
She's one of my first clients.
She's definitely nuts.

03:37.589 --> 03:39.222
She hired me to tail
her boyfriend.

03:39.257 --> 03:41.024
I'm gonna break up with her later.
I wanna feel

03:41.058 --> 03:43.826
like everything's in order before
my meeting with Kevin Bacon.

03:43.861 --> 03:45.694
So if he options it, what are
you gonna do with the money?

03:45.729 --> 03:48.263
Well, probably get some health insurance.
Go to the dentist.

03:48.297 --> 03:50.131
I haven't been to
the dentist in 14 years.

03:50.166 --> 03:52.167
I have more plaque
on my teeth than teeth.

03:52.201 --> 03:54.402
Shit, 14 years?
What else?

03:54.436 --> 03:56.637
I don't know.
I'll get some drawing pencils,

03:56.672 --> 03:58.172
a new Insulin pump for my mom,

03:58.206 --> 04:01.442
maybe cover up some
of these varicose veins.

04:04.511 --> 04:06.479
Come come.

04:06.513 --> 04:09.982
So, table for one, my friend?

04:10.016 --> 04:12.184
- Hmm?
- Jonathan Ames.

04:12.218 --> 04:14.286
- Yes.
- He's for me, Akhil.

04:16.789 --> 04:18.856
Hello.

04:18.890 --> 04:20.891
You must be Lakshmi Bhargava.

04:20.925 --> 04:23.526
Very good.
I'm impressed by your pronunciation.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.761
Thank you. I listen
to a lot of n.P.R.

04:26.662 --> 04:28.297
Come.

04:30.467 --> 04:32.902
So how can I help you,
Mrs. Bhargava.

04:32.936 --> 04:35.804
Well, I'm so ashamed
to say this,

04:35.838 --> 04:39.440
but I suspect my husband
of 15 years, Vikrum,

04:39.474 --> 04:41.909
is having a love affair.

04:41.943 --> 04:44.679
- What makes you think so?
- He's a limousine driver,

04:44.713 --> 04:48.816
but he's been coming home for weeks
only after I've gone to sleep.

04:48.850 --> 04:51.417
- What excuse does he give?
- No excuse.

04:51.451 --> 04:55.487
He must be with a woman who cooks
bacon after they make love.

04:55.521 --> 04:59.523
I smell it on his clots
and s bald head.

04:59.557 --> 05:01.758
I should have never
married a poet!

05:01.793 --> 05:06.129
But it was arranged.
Still I... I've come to love him.

05:06.164 --> 05:08.431
He's a limo driver and a poet?

05:08.465 --> 05:11.133
That's great.
I'm a detective and a writer.

05:11.167 --> 05:13.602
It's good to have more than one profession.
I also teach.

05:13.636 --> 05:16.605
I don't care.
I just want you to follow my husband.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.207
Right.

06:11.452 --> 06:13.852
Oh!
Uh hey, buddy?

06:13.887 --> 06:15.653
Why don't you go ahead
and pour me another one?

06:15.688 --> 06:17.855
This time make it
a big-girl glass.

06:23.128 --> 06:26.930
Jennifer, I...
Jesus Christ.

06:26.964 --> 06:29.032
Jennifer, I hate to, um,

06:29.066 --> 06:31.967
spring this on you right here,

06:32.002 --> 06:34.069
but I think that

06:34.103 --> 06:37.038
maybe we should stop
seeing each other.

06:37.073 --> 06:41.308
Just for a little while.
You know, maybe take a break.

06:41.343 --> 06:43.710
What are you talking about?
I don't want to take a break.

06:43.744 --> 06:46.512
- I really like you. - I just have
a lot of stuff going on right now.

06:46.546 --> 06:48.214
What's that supposed to mean?

06:48.248 --> 06:50.288
My big meeting
with Kevin Bacon tonight

06:50.320 --> 06:53.620
so you can't date me 'cause
you're seeing Kevin Bacon?

06:53.654 --> 06:55.722
I'm not seeing him.
I have a meeting.

06:55.756 --> 06:58.760
- That's what you're making it sound like.
- I'm not dating Kevin Bacon.

06:58.793 --> 07:00.626
Well, I don't know, are you?

07:00.660 --> 07:02.694
I don't... I mean...
what?

07:02.728 --> 07:04.496
No.

07:04.530 --> 07:06.097
I just want
to focus on my work.

07:06.131 --> 07:07.898
Okay?

07:07.933 --> 07:09.766
It's not me, it's you.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.901
No, that's backwards.

07:11.935 --> 07:13.536
You say,
"it's not you, it's me"

07:13.570 --> 07:15.404
- to someone.
- Right.

07:15.438 --> 07:17.072
It's not you, it's me.

07:17.106 --> 07:19.474
All right, why don't you just
be honest with me, Ray, okay?

07:19.508 --> 07:21.408
I can take it.

07:21.443 --> 07:24.177
Okay, I will be honest.

07:24.211 --> 07:28.748
You drink too much
and I'm not used to it.

07:28.783 --> 07:30.717
I like to be the heavy drinker
in a relationship.

07:30.752 --> 07:33.286
So I'll quit drinking.
I've done it a million times.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.555
I quit three weeks ago, okay?
I can do it again.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.556
Okay look, here.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.693
And that's it.
I'm done.

07:41.727 --> 07:43.795
It's over.
Wait.

07:45.230 --> 07:47.798
- It's over.
- Jennifer, you're beautiful.

07:47.832 --> 07:50.734
But you're too much for me.

07:50.768 --> 07:54.337
Someone will love you
one day, I promise you.

07:54.371 --> 07:57.973
It's just like Dylan said:
It ain't me, babe.

07:58.007 --> 08:01.842
- Did you just quote Bob Dylan?
- Yes, because you love Bob Dylan.

08:01.877 --> 08:05.312
Okay, this is now the most
disgusting breakup

08:05.346 --> 08:07.213
of my life.

08:21.328 --> 08:24.663
Do you have a air dryer in the
bathroom or are there paper towels?

08:40.811 --> 08:42.477
Sorry to bother you.

08:42.513 --> 08:45.681
I can't get 42 down.
Can you help me?

08:47.316 --> 08:49.484
The answer to 42 down
is "nincompoop."

08:49.518 --> 08:52.453
Nincompoop!
Oh man, thank you.

08:52.487 --> 08:55.522
I had the poop part,
but not the nincom.

08:55.557 --> 08:58.691
Nincomop's not a word
one hears every day,

08:58.726 --> 09:00.859
but I got the answer
immediately because, well,

09:00.893 --> 09:03.593
that's what I am...
a bloody nincompoop.

09:03.627 --> 09:06.428
Well, I've just met you, but you don't
seem like a nincompoop to me.

09:06.462 --> 09:08.930
Well, I am.
I'm a poet who can't be published

09:08.965 --> 09:10.732
and I'm a driver
who doesn't drive.

09:10.766 --> 09:13.300
The two things I love,
I fail at.

09:15.503 --> 09:17.137
Why don't you drive anymore?

09:17.171 --> 09:19.640
I was let go.
For 12 years I gave everything I had

09:19.674 --> 09:21.908
to the number one
limo company in New York,

09:21.943 --> 09:23.775
but they show me no respect.

09:23.810 --> 09:26.144
Number one in N.Y.,
that's impressive.

09:26.178 --> 09:29.647
No, that was the name of the company,
but we were number one in queens.

09:29.681 --> 09:31.882
<i>- Have you tried other companies?
- Yes.</i>

09:31.917 --> 09:35.085
37 applications so far,
but no luck.

09:35.119 --> 09:37.053
So I sit here,

09:37.087 --> 09:39.321
hiding from my beautiful wife,

09:39.356 --> 09:42.190
too ashamed to face her.

09:45.694 --> 09:48.161
I know your wife.

09:48.195 --> 09:50.329
Lakshmi Bhargava.

09:50.364 --> 09:53.699
Hey, your pronunciation...
how do you know her?

09:53.733 --> 09:56.868
I'm a private detective.
She thought you were having an affair,

09:56.902 --> 09:59.071
<i>- so she hired me to follow you.
- What?</i>

09:59.105 --> 10:02.473
Well, how much do you cost?
We can't afford you. I lost my job.

10:02.508 --> 10:05.042
My rates are very reasonable.
But don't you see?

10:05.076 --> 10:06.911
She loves you.

10:06.945 --> 10:09.379
And she'll be relieved to know
that this is all that's going on.

10:09.414 --> 10:12.815
Look, I know how to
help you and your wife.

10:12.850 --> 10:14.383
You lost your job?!

10:14.418 --> 10:16.251
I can't believe you lied to me.

10:16.286 --> 10:18.954
We have a mortgage.
Get out!

10:18.988 --> 10:20.755
Poet.

10:20.789 --> 10:23.257
No no, he couldn't help it.
It's the economy.

10:23.292 --> 10:25.559
He filled out 37 applications.

10:25.594 --> 10:27.461
At least he's not
cheating on you, right?

10:27.495 --> 10:30.597
This is worse.
This jeopardizes everything.

10:30.631 --> 10:33.066
You are a terrible detective.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.434
- I'm not paying you.
- Wait a second... wait!

10:35.469 --> 10:39.204
You love him; He loves you; Case closed.
I'm a good detective!

10:44.910 --> 10:46.510
Idiot!

10:47.812 --> 10:50.113
- You've wrecked my life.
- But...

10:57.354 --> 10:59.489
Table for one?

11:00.624 --> 11:02.825
"We need to...
we need to defend

11:02.860 --> 11:07.596
the written word."
Ah, that's better.

11:07.630 --> 11:11.165
"Books are essential
to our humanity.

11:11.200 --> 11:14.735
We need to defend
the written word."

11:14.769 --> 11:16.703
- That is so good.
- George.

11:16.738 --> 11:18.271
Oh hi. Come on in.

11:18.305 --> 11:19.839
I'm just working on this talk

11:19.873 --> 11:21.974
I have to give to this
writing class tonight.

11:22.009 --> 11:24.043
You know, rally the youth
and all of that.

11:24.077 --> 11:26.078
Sit down actually.
Let me do it for you. Come on.

11:26.112 --> 11:28.146
- Well, George, I...
- I was thinking,

11:28.180 --> 11:31.816
speaking to young writers is something
that I could do for the magazine.

11:31.850 --> 11:33.951
You know, I could
go around the country...

11:33.985 --> 11:36.453
like Mark Twain, right?

11:36.487 --> 11:38.455
You know, giving
inspirational talks.

11:38.489 --> 11:41.857
- Mark Twain? - I could also, you
know, like wear one of those,

11:41.892 --> 11:45.627
uh, what do you call 'em?
You know, prosthetic mustaches.

11:45.662 --> 11:49.664
It could be very theatrical.
Mark twain had white hair as well.

11:49.698 --> 11:52.833
You know? And he loved three-piece suits.
I'm just saying.

11:52.868 --> 11:54.668
We can discuss
this later, George,

11:54.703 --> 11:56.169
but a more pressing issue

11:56.203 --> 11:59.105
is that we need to cut
columns from the magazine.

11:59.140 --> 12:01.173
Ugh, again?

12:02.342 --> 12:05.277
All right, how about
the astrology column?

12:05.311 --> 12:07.178
We can lose that.
It's frivolous.

12:07.213 --> 12:10.214
No, it's very popular.
The people love it.

12:10.248 --> 12:13.016
I'm sorry, George,
but the board in Dallas

12:13.051 --> 12:14.918
wants to cut your column.

12:16.687 --> 12:18.721
My "By George" column?

12:18.755 --> 12:20.521
Oh no no no no.

12:20.556 --> 12:23.324
Katherine, Kath...
I've written that for 20 years.

12:23.358 --> 12:27.227
Just this morning
I wrote my best piece ever

12:27.261 --> 12:28.728
about my prostate.

12:28.762 --> 12:31.697
Oh no no no.
They can't take that away from me.

12:31.731 --> 12:34.032
I know, George,
but they are adamant.

12:34.067 --> 12:36.801
- There's nothing we can do.
- No, Katherine,

12:36.835 --> 12:40.070
I am my column.

12:40.104 --> 12:43.072
I mean, I'm writing it
in my mind all the time.

12:43.107 --> 12:45.908
Well, maybe you could,
um, keep a diary.

12:45.942 --> 12:47.843
I'm sorry, what?
A diary?

12:47.877 --> 12:49.978
Oh...

12:51.614 --> 12:53.848
You know, let me ask you
something here.

12:53.883 --> 12:56.884
What exactly do you see as
my role here at the magazine?

12:56.919 --> 12:59.588
- I know it's been diminished, George.
- Diminished?

12:59.622 --> 13:01.958
But you're still very good
at cocktail parties.

13:01.992 --> 13:04.427
Our advertisers love you.

13:04.462 --> 13:07.030
Cocktail parties?

13:07.064 --> 13:09.164
Well,

13:09.199 --> 13:13.402
maybe I'll have a little
drink right now then.

13:14.570 --> 13:17.037
Yeah, hey, cocktail party.

13:17.072 --> 13:18.805
"Hey I'm George Christopher.

13:18.840 --> 13:22.509
You're from Dallas.
Oh, you must be an asshole."

13:31.151 --> 13:32.485
Jonathan?

13:32.519 --> 13:34.354
Oh hey, Nina.

13:34.388 --> 13:36.256
Come in, come in.

13:37.858 --> 13:40.893
Are you okay?
We can reschedule this if you want.

13:40.927 --> 13:43.126
No no, it's fine.
I just, um,

13:43.161 --> 13:46.696
I destroyed a man's life today.

13:46.730 --> 13:48.431
That happens.

13:48.465 --> 13:50.366
I destroyed someone last week

13:50.401 --> 13:54.403
but people are a lot stronger
than we give them credit for.

13:54.437 --> 13:58.340
At least that's what
my therapist says.

13:58.374 --> 13:59.842
That's true.

13:59.876 --> 14:02.912
Uh, okay, enough about me.
Let's discuss your story.

14:07.984 --> 14:10.652
Well, first of all
I love your prose.

14:10.686 --> 14:13.921
Thank you!
That means a lot to me.

14:13.955 --> 14:15.722
My main question is this:

14:15.756 --> 14:19.959
Is it believable that a
beautiful 16-year-old girl

14:19.993 --> 14:22.227
would fall in love
with a high-school teacher

14:22.261 --> 14:24.462
who has a weak chin
and forehead psoriasis?

14:24.496 --> 14:26.730
Oh yes, it is believable.

14:26.765 --> 14:30.334
Teachers can be
very charismatic.

14:31.737 --> 14:33.370
Really?

14:41.610 --> 14:43.511
You have a very beautiful hand.

14:43.545 --> 14:45.479
Thank you.

14:45.513 --> 14:48.949
I'm sorry.
That was not appropriate.

14:48.983 --> 14:50.417
You're my student.

14:50.451 --> 14:52.952
Jonathan, I'm almost your age.

14:52.987 --> 14:55.287
You haven't done
anything wrong.

14:55.322 --> 14:57.889
I've been wanting
to tell you...

14:57.923 --> 15:00.391
the virginity scene
in your novel

15:00.425 --> 15:03.127
is really hot
even though you...

15:03.161 --> 15:07.098
I mean your narrator...
had a premature ejaculation.

15:10.402 --> 15:13.504
<i>Oh hi, George.</i>

15:13.538 --> 15:15.173
Come in.
We were just...

15:15.207 --> 15:17.241
this is my student
Nina Cassidy.

15:17.276 --> 15:19.377
- Hi. - Nina, this is
George Christopher.

15:19.411 --> 15:21.946
- He's my mentor.
- Mentor?

15:21.980 --> 15:24.814
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

15:24.849 --> 15:27.016
George is gonna speak
to our class tonight.

15:27.051 --> 15:29.550
Oh really?
What are you gonna talk about?

15:29.584 --> 15:31.317
Ah.

15:31.351 --> 15:34.685
So just like I have
cancer of the prostate,

15:34.720 --> 15:37.588
the publishing industry
also has cancer.

15:37.622 --> 15:40.724
Magazines are dying.

15:41.692 --> 15:43.493
Books are dying.

15:44.361 --> 15:45.928
<i>Newspapers are dying.</i>

15:45.962 --> 15:51.699
Print is dead.

15:53.702 --> 15:55.569
Questions?

15:57.405 --> 15:58.872
<i>Anybody?</i>

15:59.874 --> 16:01.908
Okay, that was bleak.

16:01.942 --> 16:05.277
Thank you, George, but like
things with the environment,

16:05.312 --> 16:08.213
we have at least a few more
years before the end of time.

16:10.349 --> 16:12.984
I always have this dream
where I'm flying, you know?

16:13.018 --> 16:14.752
And then I wake up
and I'm heartbroken

16:14.786 --> 16:16.854
that I can't fly.
What do you think that means?

16:16.888 --> 16:18.255
I don't know.
I never dream.

16:18.289 --> 16:20.156
I smoke pot right
before I go to bed,

16:20.191 --> 16:22.325
and it shuts down
the dream side of my brain.

16:22.359 --> 16:25.594
Right. You know, that's one of the
things I love about Super Ray...

16:25.629 --> 16:29.231
is that he flies. I have always wanted
to play a superhero who could fly.

16:29.265 --> 16:31.499
- Oh, great, I...
- Listen, about my process.

16:31.533 --> 16:33.835
I'm gonna need
to get close to you.

16:33.869 --> 16:35.970
Maybe move in,

16:36.005 --> 16:39.674
wear your clothes, t-shirts...
kinda get your scent on me.

16:39.709 --> 16:41.442
- Really? That's necessary?
- Definitely.

16:41.477 --> 16:43.711
I'm just gonna warn you...
I don't wear deodorant.

16:43.745 --> 16:45.579
I gotta tell you,
I think it's amazing

16:45.614 --> 16:47.481
that he uses his
huge cock as a weapon.

16:47.515 --> 16:49.616
I mean that's just awesome.

16:49.650 --> 16:52.118
I mean that just seems
really true to life.

16:52.152 --> 16:54.286
Thanks.
I kinda see his huge cock

16:54.320 --> 16:56.354
as like Thor's hammer.

16:56.388 --> 16:58.756
Yeah well, I can
definitely do that.

17:08.366 --> 17:11.701
I'm sorry, Jonathan.
I didn't mean to wreck your class.

17:12.936 --> 17:14.704
It's just...

17:14.738 --> 17:18.007
Between the cancer
and things falling apart

17:18.040 --> 17:22.344
at the magazine
I'm just all muddled.

17:22.377 --> 17:26.214
- I'm sorry, George. - And I'm not
gonna quit, so don't even suggest it,

17:26.248 --> 17:28.615
but I think I'm addicted
to marijuana again.

17:28.650 --> 17:30.917
- Oh no, why?
- Well, for one thing

17:30.952 --> 17:33.586
I'm not happy
unless I'm stoned.

17:34.954 --> 17:36.487
The other night I got high

17:36.522 --> 17:38.555
and I took a walk and I...

17:38.590 --> 17:40.660
Separated from my shadow.

17:40.694 --> 17:43.095
Shit, that does sound strange.

17:43.129 --> 17:45.563
Oh... and then
I'm driving stoned

17:45.598 --> 17:47.632
and that's just
dangerous, you know.

17:47.666 --> 17:50.100
Especially because
when I'm smoking

17:50.135 --> 17:52.703
the left and the right
sides of my body

17:52.737 --> 17:56.272
just, you know, don't
communicate with each other.

17:57.507 --> 18:00.674
Do you think you might
wanna hire a driver?

18:06.808 --> 18:09.042
Yeah, I see what you mean.

18:09.076 --> 18:11.544
Your driving really
has deteriorated.

18:11.578 --> 18:15.582
Yeah, I know. That marijuana makes
parking especially difficult.

18:15.616 --> 18:18.084
It's a spatial issue.

18:18.118 --> 18:21.620
Hey, thanks so much for helping
me out with this, George.

18:21.655 --> 18:23.589
- Ah.
- I never should have meddled.

18:23.623 --> 18:25.757
Yeah, in life when
in doubt, never meddle.

18:25.792 --> 18:28.192
It only causes problems.

18:30.227 --> 18:32.261
He should be here.

18:34.899 --> 18:36.766
There's Vikrum.
This is gonna be great.

18:36.800 --> 18:40.770
- You're gonna make him really happy.
- Everybody get on the ground!

18:40.804 --> 18:43.939
And throw your cell phones to
the middle of the floor. Now!

18:43.974 --> 18:45.807
Vikrum, Vikrum,
what are you doing?

18:45.842 --> 18:48.910
You! You idiot detective.

18:48.944 --> 18:51.111
Get on the floor!
Both of you.

18:51.145 --> 18:52.846
I just had my suit
dry-cleaned

18:52.880 --> 18:54.681
and I have a bad knee too
actually.

18:54.715 --> 18:56.249
Do you mind if I stand?

18:56.283 --> 18:58.017
Dry-clean?

18:58.052 --> 18:59.351
Shut up!

18:59.386 --> 19:01.419
Vikrum, don't do this.
Don't do...

19:07.124 --> 19:09.125
this is who you
wanted me to hire?

19:09.159 --> 19:11.326
- He's not really like this.
- Well?

19:11.360 --> 19:14.061
I can talk him down.

19:14.096 --> 19:17.429
Vikrum.
Vikrum, listen to me.

19:17.464 --> 19:19.264
Just give me the gun, okay?

19:19.298 --> 19:21.299
<i>- You'll go to prison.
- I don't care anymore.</i>

19:21.334 --> 19:24.169
I already see all of life as a prison.
At least when I was a driver

19:24.203 --> 19:25.971
I was in a moving prison.

19:26.005 --> 19:28.007
Vikrum, you can't give up.

19:28.041 --> 19:31.879
I'm also a struggling writer, but I'm
gonna submit a story to "The New Yorker."

19:31.914 --> 19:34.349
Don't talk to me about
"The New Yorker."

19:34.383 --> 19:37.851
Those bastards rejected
66 of my poems.

19:37.886 --> 19:42.088
Hey, you know, they rejected all of my
submissions to the caption contest.

19:42.123 --> 19:44.057
Maybe it's just the magazine.

19:46.426 --> 19:48.727
I'm not mechanically inclined.

19:48.762 --> 19:51.363
Vikrum, you haven't done
anything wrong yet, okay?

19:51.397 --> 19:54.299
- You haven't taken any money.
- That's because I can't open the drawer.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.434
No, if you really wanted money
you could have taken

19:56.468 --> 19:58.769
everyone's wallets
and jewelry, but you didn't.

19:58.804 --> 20:02.272
Everybody! Throw your wallets and
jewelry to the center of the floor!

20:02.307 --> 20:04.741
- Thank you.
- Nice one.

20:05.776 --> 20:07.610
Ugh, Jesus.

20:07.645 --> 20:09.712
So I can try to gain
the weight,

20:09.747 --> 20:12.314
but chances are I'm probably gonna
have to go with a fat suit.

20:12.349 --> 20:15.450
Uh well, I'm really not fat.

20:15.484 --> 20:18.820
I mean, I kinda see myself
as stocky or portly

20:18.855 --> 20:21.790
and I mean, you can wear a
stocky suit or a portly suit.

20:21.824 --> 20:23.659
Yeah, that's true.

20:23.693 --> 20:26.094
Well, except for maybe
in the belly area.

20:26.129 --> 20:28.063
I'm just kinda washboardy.

20:28.097 --> 20:30.299
You know, so I can just
pad that up a little bit.

20:30.333 --> 20:32.467
And, uh, I'll try to grow
the beard but really

20:32.502 --> 20:35.670
this is all I get and I'm
just highly evolved.

20:35.704 --> 20:38.604
Oh, God damn it,
motherfucking piece of shit.

20:38.638 --> 20:41.673
<i>- I can't believe it.
- Ray?</i>

20:41.708 --> 20:43.909
I didn't know you'd be here.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.377
Jennifer, this is Kevin Bacon.
Kevin this is Jennifer.

20:46.411 --> 20:49.579
- Hi. Kevin Bacon.
- Oh, he's been bragging about meeting you.

20:49.613 --> 20:51.246
I thought he was lying.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.847
Which he does pathologically.

20:52.882 --> 20:54.882
- Excuse me?
- Jennifer, will you just please...

20:54.916 --> 20:57.351
- I don't know if he's made love to you yet.
- No not yet.

20:57.385 --> 20:59.586
When he does
you should be careful

20:59.621 --> 21:02.388
because he gave me oral
chlamydia of the mouth.

21:02.422 --> 21:05.090
- I... what? - I didn't know
you could get oral chlamydia.

21:05.124 --> 21:06.658
I've only had it
the normal way.

21:06.692 --> 21:08.259
We'll be right back.

21:08.293 --> 21:11.095
Don't touch my elbow!
That is assault.

21:11.130 --> 21:12.964
- That's not cool, bro.
- He assaulted me.

21:12.999 --> 21:15.166
When you don't wanna be
touched that is assault.

21:15.201 --> 21:18.568
- Yeah, that is the legal definition.
- I did not assault you.

21:18.603 --> 21:20.134
Yes, you did, super chlamydia.

21:20.169 --> 21:22.536
Don't... but I don't have
chlamydia, Kevin. I don't.

21:22.570 --> 21:26.306
- What's going on here? - This fat bully
gave me an s.T.D. And assaulted me.

21:26.341 --> 21:29.076
All right, that's it. An s.
T.D.? You're out of here.

21:29.110 --> 21:30.510
Excuse me.

21:34.915 --> 21:37.612
Oh, oww!

21:37.647 --> 21:39.613
No no no,
that is not cool, man.

21:39.648 --> 21:41.615
I'm an actor!

21:41.650 --> 21:45.052
What are you thinking?
I've made a living off this nose for 30 years.

21:45.086 --> 21:46.853
Put those phones away!

21:47.822 --> 21:49.588
Look what you've do to me.

21:49.623 --> 21:51.023
You know what?

21:51.057 --> 21:53.357
I don't think you're
cut out to play Super Ray.

22:08.444 --> 22:10.779
So you want to buy me a drink?

22:10.813 --> 22:12.580
Yeah.

22:12.614 --> 22:14.848
But listen, can we get
out of Brooklyn?

22:14.882 --> 22:17.784
It's just not as cool
as I thought it was gonna be.

22:17.818 --> 22:19.085
Oh yeah.

22:20.387 --> 22:23.021
- Excuse us.
- Here's a really really big tip.

22:24.056 --> 22:26.224
- I'm okay.
- Kevin Bacon's okay.

22:26.258 --> 22:27.992
Kevin Bacon's all right.

22:28.927 --> 22:30.327
I can't believe it.

22:30.362 --> 22:33.897
- Jonathan, say something.
It's time to meddle. - Yeah.

22:33.931 --> 22:37.700
You know Lakshmi will be furious with
you if you go through with this.

22:37.735 --> 22:39.769
Well, she's already
furious thanks to you.

22:39.803 --> 22:41.571
You know something?

22:41.605 --> 22:43.973
I take back what I said.

22:44.007 --> 22:46.374
You are a nincompoop.
Yeah.

22:46.409 --> 22:48.043
You are a 42 down.

22:48.077 --> 22:51.178
Hey!
Don't be rude.

22:51.213 --> 22:54.114
You have no idea
what I've gone through.

22:54.149 --> 22:57.450
You don't understand what it's
like to turn up to work one day

22:57.485 --> 22:59.886
and to be told "pffft!
You're worthless"

22:59.920 --> 23:01.854
after so many years.

23:01.888 --> 23:05.724
Yeah, excuse me,
but I understand.

23:05.758 --> 23:09.627
You know my whole identity
is wrapped up in my job,

23:09.662 --> 23:11.629
but they won't listen
to me anymore.

23:11.663 --> 23:14.698
I'm being pushed aside.
You know, I'm slowly

23:14.733 --> 23:16.800
losing my place in the world.

23:16.834 --> 23:19.402
Yes, that's...
that's what happened to me.

23:19.436 --> 23:23.439
I suggested to the boss that they put a
line of poetry on all the business cards

23:23.473 --> 23:27.542
and I had great ideas about the schedule,
but they just... they didn't care!

23:27.577 --> 23:31.345
Hey, can I call you Vikrum? Vikrum, see, you
and I are going through the same thing here.

23:31.380 --> 23:33.481
Why don't you...
why don't you put the gun down?

23:33.515 --> 23:36.516
'Cause, um, see, I have a job
that I'd like to offer you.

23:36.551 --> 23:38.484
- You have a job for me?
- Yes.

23:38.519 --> 23:42.455
See, he told me about you
and I need a driver.

23:42.489 --> 23:46.725
And I really...
I admire poets

23:46.759 --> 23:49.394
and I'd very much like
to read your work.

23:49.428 --> 23:52.262
So why-why... why don't
you just give me the gun?

23:53.465 --> 23:55.298
- You really like poetry?
- He does.

23:55.333 --> 23:56.533
- I do.
- He does.

23:59.169 --> 24:00.436
Thank you.

24:00.470 --> 24:02.071
It's not even loaded.

24:02.105 --> 24:05.240
My father gave it to me in 1983
because of the cricket riots.

24:05.274 --> 24:07.609
It's been on the bottom
of a drawer ever since.

24:07.643 --> 24:09.243
- Huh!
- I'm gonna call 911.

24:09.278 --> 24:10.911
- No no.
- Ma'am, that's not necessary.

24:10.946 --> 24:12.113
- Yes!
- No no no.

24:12.147 --> 24:13.847
It's fine, really.
Everything's fine here.

24:13.882 --> 24:17.050
It's just a normal
human reaction to stress.

24:17.084 --> 24:20.251
- Thank you.
- I mean, come on... the gun's not even loaded.

24:20.286 --> 24:23.220
Oh, what? I don't want it!

24:23.254 --> 24:25.455
Let's get out of here!
Come on!

24:26.590 --> 24:28.757
All right,
nobody call the cops!

24:31.393 --> 24:34.228
I can get us out of here.
I know a service road the police won't think of.

24:34.262 --> 24:36.098
- If you trust me to drive, that is.
- I trust you.

24:36.132 --> 24:39.067
- Great, let's go!
- I love this orange color!

24:39.267 --> 24:48.467
