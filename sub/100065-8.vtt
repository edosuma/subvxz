00:09.792 --> 00:11.663
â™ª

00:21.195 --> 00:22.239
Mrs. Davis?

00:22.283 --> 00:23.501
Uh, yes.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.155
Detective Reagan.

00:25.199 --> 00:28.376
I understand you had an incident
with your ex-husband?

00:28.419 --> 00:29.681
Warren and I are separated.

00:29.725 --> 00:32.249
I served him with divorce papers
this morning.

00:32.293 --> 00:33.468
Okay. So what happened?

00:33.511 --> 00:37.298
Uh, he came over, um,
screaming, crying.

00:37.341 --> 00:39.430
I probably shouldn't
have let him in,

00:39.474 --> 00:41.476
but I thought I could reason
with him.

00:41.519 --> 00:43.043
Did he put his hands on you?

00:43.086 --> 00:44.479
No. No, no, um...

00:44.522 --> 00:46.350
But he said there's no way

00:46.394 --> 00:48.613
he'd ever let me
tear our family apart.

00:48.657 --> 00:50.485
I see.[gate squeaks open]

00:51.790 --> 00:53.183
[Danny clears throat][boy sighs]

00:53.227 --> 00:54.924
You didn't have
to call the police, Mom.

00:54.967 --> 00:57.840
This is our son, Andrew.Dad was just upset.

00:57.883 --> 00:59.581
Doesn't give him the right
to threaten you guys.

00:59.624 --> 01:01.713
I gotta go.

01:06.892 --> 01:09.069
It's gotta be tough on him.

01:09.112 --> 01:11.941
It is.

01:11.984 --> 01:14.639
I wish it didn't have to be
this way.

01:14.683 --> 01:17.686
Yeah, I understand.
Um, I also understand

01:17.729 --> 01:19.992
that, uh,
Children's Services assigned

01:20.036 --> 01:22.212
an investigative consultant
to your case, is that right?

01:22.256 --> 01:23.387
Uh, yes.

01:23.431 --> 01:26.216
He's been incredibly supportive.

01:26.260 --> 01:27.217
Um...

01:27.261 --> 01:28.871
This is him now.

01:32.440 --> 01:33.745
Morning, Detective.

01:42.450 --> 01:44.408
Hey, that fits
the description

01:44.452 --> 01:46.367
of the vehicle wanted
in connection

01:46.410 --> 01:48.064
with the double homicide
in the Bronx last night.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.066
Good eye.
Run the plate.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.024
JANKO:
Brandon Phelps.

01:52.068 --> 01:54.505
Registration expired
two months ago.

01:54.549 --> 01:56.116
Let's go.

01:56.159 --> 01:58.118
[siren wailing]

02:17.049 --> 02:19.791
Registration's
expired, Brandon.

02:19.835 --> 02:22.054
So write me a ticket
and let me get out of here.

02:23.491 --> 02:25.188
Do me a favor,
lower this rear window.

02:27.582 --> 02:29.801
Now put your hands back
on the wheel, please.

02:41.422 --> 02:44.729
What've we got
here, Brandon?

02:44.773 --> 02:46.557
No idea what that is.TROY: We're gonna need

02:46.601 --> 02:47.993
to search the vehicle.

02:48.037 --> 02:49.430
Step out of the car.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.345
Now.

02:51.388 --> 02:53.216
Let's go.

02:54.261 --> 02:55.436
Put your hands
on the car.

03:06.577 --> 03:09.406
.38 caliber revolver.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.495
What was the caliber gun used
in those shootings last night?

03:11.539 --> 03:13.584
.38-- Put your hands
behind your back.

03:13.628 --> 03:16.283
What a coincidence.I didn't shoot nobody.

03:16.326 --> 03:17.414
Guess we'll find out.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.242
Good eye, Janko.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.853
Real good eye.

03:21.897 --> 03:24.682
[handcuffs click][sighs] Let's go.

03:27.468 --> 03:29.513
[sighs]

03:29.557 --> 03:31.863
Okay. How did it start?

03:31.907 --> 03:34.388
As a typical noise complaint.

03:34.431 --> 03:36.999
Restaurant manager said
he asked the group in question

03:37.042 --> 03:40.089
to quiet down repeatedly
before calling 911.

03:40.132 --> 03:41.656
And there were calls
from the neighbors

03:41.699 --> 03:43.092
about what had spilled out
onto the sidewalk.

03:43.135 --> 03:44.267
GORMLEY:
So a pretty
rowdy group

03:44.311 --> 03:46.878
that was really
getting out of hand.

03:46.922 --> 03:50.708
But also chock-full
of FDNY brass.

03:50.752 --> 03:53.537
Responding officers did not have
that information.

03:53.581 --> 03:58.499
And when did our guys ascertain
that information?

03:58.542 --> 04:01.502
No way to know that,
specifically.

04:01.545 --> 04:05.723
Maybe when they pulled up
and clocked the FDNY badges

04:05.767 --> 04:09.640
and plates on the vehicles
in front of the restaurant?

04:09.684 --> 04:11.686
Could be.

04:11.729 --> 04:13.688
Was exactly.

04:13.731 --> 04:15.864
Point being, our guys
did not arrive on the scene

04:15.907 --> 04:18.910
with any intent other
than to quell the disturbance.

04:18.954 --> 04:21.261
Yet, somehow,

04:21.304 --> 04:24.873
they managed
to arrest Stan Rourke.

04:24.916 --> 04:26.831
Well, yeah.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.704
[laughing]: Yeah, well,
that's pretty resourceful,

04:29.747 --> 04:31.183
I'll give us that.

04:31.227 --> 04:33.664
Turning a noise complaint
about a retirement racket

04:33.708 --> 04:37.668
into collaring
the FDNY commissioner.

04:37.712 --> 04:41.281
Boss, all the eyewitnesses said
the exact same thing.

04:41.324 --> 04:43.457
Our guy was appealing
to Commissioner Rourke

04:43.500 --> 04:45.894
who responded by laying hands
on our guy.

04:45.937 --> 04:48.940
Watch out, Sid, there's
an elephant in the room.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.725
"Our" guys, "their" guys.

04:50.768 --> 04:53.641
This has been going on
as long as I've been a cop.

04:53.684 --> 04:55.773
Again, boss,
our guys didn't start this.

04:55.817 --> 04:58.080
No, but it just might be

04:58.123 --> 05:00.561
our guys poured gasoline on it.

05:04.869 --> 05:07.698
A.D.A. Erin Reagan.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.702
Thanks so much for coming up.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.008
Pleasure meeting you, Mr. Mayor.

05:13.051 --> 05:14.662
Mayor-elect.

05:14.705 --> 05:16.533
Mr. Mayor-elect.

05:16.577 --> 05:18.143
How about just Peter?

05:18.187 --> 05:19.275
Peter.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.798
Please.

05:27.109 --> 05:29.024
So, congratulations.

05:29.067 --> 05:30.547
Yeah, thanks.

05:30.591 --> 05:33.158
I liked a lot of what you
had to say on the campaign.

05:33.202 --> 05:35.247
Some of which was true...

05:35.291 --> 05:37.162
and some of which
was a combination

05:37.206 --> 05:39.774
of pandering
and wishful thinking.

05:39.817 --> 05:41.863
And which was which?

05:41.906 --> 05:43.778
Doesn't matter, I got the job.

05:43.821 --> 05:46.389
So now all of it has to be true.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.260
Right.

05:48.304 --> 05:50.785
Which is why I've asked you up.

05:50.828 --> 05:53.570
Gulp.

05:53.614 --> 05:56.181
Nah. It's all good.

05:57.792 --> 05:59.924
I don't like your boss's bent.

06:01.796 --> 06:03.798
I didn't know
my boss had a bent.

06:03.841 --> 06:06.496
He thinks accused criminals

06:06.540 --> 06:09.281
and their victims
both have equal rights.

06:09.325 --> 06:11.153
They don't have equal rights.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.503
They are both protected
under the law.

06:13.547 --> 06:15.723
Yes, and rightly so.

06:15.766 --> 06:17.986
But he gets lost in the weeds.

06:19.466 --> 06:22.512
I don't think your office
has the trust that it should.

06:22.556 --> 06:23.731
The people's trust?

06:23.774 --> 06:24.732
That's our customer.

06:24.775 --> 06:25.776
That's who we serve.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.822
Well, we serve the law,
actually.

06:27.865 --> 06:29.345
That, too.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.739
But don't forget the customer.

06:33.305 --> 06:37.397
I'd like to support your run
for Manhattan district attorney.

06:38.702 --> 06:40.965
I... [chuckles]
I don't have a run.

06:41.009 --> 06:42.750
You do now, if you want.

06:42.793 --> 06:44.142
With the mayor's backing.

06:44.186 --> 06:45.361
The mayor-elect.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.624
In a month and a half, mayor.

06:47.668 --> 06:50.279
By a landslide.

06:50.322 --> 06:52.847
You're gonna get a call
from Sam Terhune.

06:52.890 --> 06:55.806
He's been with me since day one.

06:55.850 --> 06:58.722
Have the coffee, hear him out,
share your concerns.

06:58.766 --> 07:02.160
Well, my first concern is that
I am loyal to my office,

07:02.204 --> 07:03.727
and you're asking me to...

07:03.771 --> 07:06.382
Stay loyal to your office.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.472
Mr. Chatwal is not the office.

07:09.516 --> 07:12.519
He's just the guy sitting
in it for now.

07:19.264 --> 07:22.354
â™ª

07:39.894 --> 07:40.764
I didn't even know
you were working

07:40.808 --> 07:42.157
with Child Services,
Gramps.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.941
Their high-risk caseload's
gone through the roof.

07:43.985 --> 07:46.248
Well, it's pretty
smart of ACS

07:46.291 --> 07:48.468
to reach out to retired
cops, I'll say that much.

07:48.511 --> 07:51.558
Well, they need the help,
I got the time.
Right.

07:51.601 --> 07:53.211
So, this Davis guy,
you met him?

07:53.255 --> 07:56.301
Does he pose any threat
to his wife and kid?

07:56.345 --> 07:57.520
Warren's a decent guy.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.522
Decent guy?

07:59.566 --> 08:02.003
He just did eight months
in state prison.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.355
He ran a nursing home
in Queens.
Uh-huh.

08:06.398 --> 08:07.922
He got hooked
on pain meds,
Mm-hmm.

08:07.965 --> 08:10.315
and then he started stealing
the pills from the residents.

08:10.359 --> 08:14.058
Not for nothing, that doesn't
exactly sound like a decent guy.

08:14.102 --> 08:16.365
He made a mistake,
he paid for it.

08:16.408 --> 08:18.802
Now he's fighting
to keep his family alive.

08:18.846 --> 08:20.587
Sounds like that
ship already sailed.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.589
You know where
I can find him?

08:22.632 --> 08:25.287
Yeah. Warren's parole officer
got him a job in a drug rehab.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.723
Great. Give me the address,

08:26.767 --> 08:28.769
and I'll drop you off at home
on my way to see him.

08:28.812 --> 08:29.944
Fat chance.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.469
I'm working this case
same as you.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.515
[chuckles]

08:37.734 --> 08:39.562
Okay.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.261
[sighs]

08:43.305 --> 08:44.567
Hey.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.656
So I go
to this joker's apartment.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.832
Turns out he's not
just dating the victim,

08:48.876 --> 08:51.400
he's dating
her sister, too.

08:51.443 --> 08:53.010
Uh-huh.

08:53.054 --> 08:55.926
And the sister, oh,
she's got a full-face tattoo

08:55.970 --> 08:58.625
of the Pope and Mother Teresa
riding a Harley.

08:58.668 --> 09:00.278
Yeah. Got it.

09:00.322 --> 09:01.758
You haven't heard
a word I said.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.107
What's going on with you?

09:03.151 --> 09:05.457
[sighs] Just...

09:09.636 --> 09:13.030
I met with Mayor-elect Chase
this morning.

09:13.074 --> 09:15.990
He wants to support me in a run
for the D.A.'s office.

09:16.033 --> 09:17.295
Shut the front door.

09:17.339 --> 09:18.296
I know.

09:18.340 --> 09:19.384
And what'd you tell him?

09:19.428 --> 09:20.603
Well, I didn't say much
of anything.

09:20.647 --> 09:23.606
Well, including "no"?I listened, mostly.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.608
Yeah, but no "no."There are a hundred reasons

09:25.652 --> 09:27.610
why this is a bad idea.

09:27.654 --> 09:28.742
Yeah. And one good one.

09:28.785 --> 09:30.439
'Cause you'd be a kick-ass D.A.

09:30.482 --> 09:31.745
Thank you.

09:31.788 --> 09:33.268
But if I put my hat in the ring,

09:33.311 --> 09:35.096
this whole office
will go upside down.

09:35.139 --> 09:37.794
The boss is gonna come after you
with both barrels.

09:37.838 --> 09:39.622
Well, I can handle him.
Problem is,

09:39.666 --> 09:42.103
he's gonna force everyone
in the building to choose sides.

09:42.146 --> 09:43.452
Yeah, well, you have
a hell of a lot more friends

09:43.495 --> 09:44.671
around here than he does.

09:44.714 --> 09:47.195
But do I have what it takes
to beat him?

09:47.238 --> 09:49.980
Only one way to find out.

09:50.024 --> 09:52.679
Yeah. The hard way.

10:01.775 --> 10:04.386
Hey. Nice work out
there this morning.

10:04.429 --> 10:05.953
Thanks, Sarge.Oh, thanks.
That gun

10:05.996 --> 10:07.694
you got out of that car
looks good for the murder weapon

10:07.737 --> 10:09.696
used in that double homicide
up in the Bronx.

10:09.739 --> 10:11.045
That's great news.Phelps gets charged

10:11.088 --> 10:12.176
for the murders,
could be a commendation in it

10:12.220 --> 10:13.569
for both of you.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.397
Just happy to take a mutt
like that off the street.

10:20.010 --> 10:21.838
Hey.
Huh?

10:21.882 --> 10:23.274
What?

10:23.318 --> 10:24.449
Nothing.

10:24.493 --> 10:26.060
Something.

10:26.103 --> 10:28.715
We got a bad guy.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.847
What could be the matter?

10:47.995 --> 10:49.692
Thank you, Lieutenant.

10:53.261 --> 10:55.829
You're gonna pay for this,
you son of a bitch.

10:55.872 --> 10:57.395
No, I'm not.

10:57.439 --> 11:00.529
Your guys targeted my racket
to bust our balls!

11:00.572 --> 11:02.400
They responded
to a noise complaint.

11:02.444 --> 11:06.187
Instead of dialing it down,
you chose to get belligerent.

11:06.230 --> 11:07.536
That's not how it went down.

11:07.579 --> 11:09.494
That's exactly how it went down.

11:09.538 --> 11:11.061
Oh, you can't whitewash this,
Frank-- my guys have

11:11.105 --> 11:12.715
the whole thing
on their phones, you know.

11:12.759 --> 11:15.413
Yeah, I saw 'em.
You laid hands on my cop.

11:15.457 --> 11:16.806
I stuck my finger in his chest.

11:16.850 --> 11:19.896
You jabbed your finger
in his chest repeatedly.

11:19.940 --> 11:22.725
To make a point!They had every right
to haul you in.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.814
Because you license your guys
to harass us.

11:24.858 --> 11:26.511
The hell I do.Oh, come on, Frank,

11:26.555 --> 11:29.210
your guys stick it to my guys
every chance they get.

11:29.253 --> 11:31.821
NYPD can't stand
that we get all the glory.

11:31.865 --> 11:34.215
Oh, while we grind it out
and do our job.

11:34.258 --> 11:35.956
Your guys targeted me.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.479
That's the fact.

11:37.522 --> 11:39.481
My guys responded by the book.

11:39.524 --> 11:41.875
[taps table]That's... the fact.

11:43.833 --> 11:47.837
I am the commissioner
of the FDNY.

11:47.881 --> 11:51.014
Which is why you weren't cuffed
when we hauled you in here.

11:51.058 --> 11:52.799
Cut the crap, Stan.

11:52.842 --> 11:54.844
[slaps paper]

11:54.888 --> 11:56.933
Summons for harassment.

11:56.977 --> 11:59.283
You're free to go.

12:01.982 --> 12:04.854
You haven't heard
the last of this, Frank.

12:06.595 --> 12:07.901
[door slams]

12:11.469 --> 12:14.777
You were supposed to call me
before reaching out to Karen.

12:14.821 --> 12:17.388
I know.
It's just the, uh...

12:17.432 --> 12:19.695
divorce papers, uh,

12:19.739 --> 12:21.001
they caught me off guard.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.829
Doesn't give you a right
to threaten your family.

12:22.872 --> 12:24.961
You're right.
I lost my head.

12:25.005 --> 12:27.181
You staying clean?Absolutely.

12:27.224 --> 12:29.792
Warren's P.O. says
he's been the model parolee.

12:29.836 --> 12:32.055
Well, I'm sure his soon-to-be
ex-wife would say different.

12:32.099 --> 12:33.491
Well, I put Karen through a lot.

12:33.535 --> 12:35.363
I don't blame her
if she gives up on me.

12:35.406 --> 12:37.017
So why the meltdown today?

12:37.060 --> 12:38.583
Look...

12:40.934 --> 12:42.805
I can live
with losing my marriage,

12:42.849 --> 12:45.242
but not my son--
he means everything to me.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.680
You gonna tell
my parole officer?

12:48.724 --> 12:49.812
What do you think?

12:49.856 --> 12:51.248
No one got hurt.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.425
[sighs]

12:57.864 --> 12:59.822
Fine.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.824
I won't tell him this time.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.260
But no more shenanigans.

13:03.304 --> 13:05.001
You've got my word.

13:08.265 --> 13:10.528
Thank you.

13:10.572 --> 13:12.226
What was that?What was what?

13:12.269 --> 13:13.836
You guys were
acting all chummy.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.230
You acted like more of a
social worker than a cop.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.841
I'm not here as a cop.
My job is to get

13:18.885 --> 13:20.843
the best possible outcome
for this family.
[sighs]

13:20.887 --> 13:23.759
Well, my job is
to enforce the law.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.982
You've gone over
that arrest report

13:29.025 --> 13:31.114
a dozen times.

13:31.158 --> 13:33.116
Troy asks the suspect
to lower the rear window,

13:33.160 --> 13:35.815
and there was a single vial
right there on the seat.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.077
So?

13:37.120 --> 13:39.993
No drugs on him
or anywhere else in the car.

13:40.036 --> 13:41.995
Again, so?

13:42.038 --> 13:43.561
So it's pretty convenient.

13:43.605 --> 13:47.522
Drug dealers have been known
to carry drugs, Jamie.

13:47.565 --> 13:49.524
In plain view on the back seat?

13:50.568 --> 13:52.222
So he was careless.

13:52.266 --> 13:55.617
And we did find a gun
that killed two people.

13:55.660 --> 13:57.271
So there's that.

13:57.314 --> 14:00.056
When Troy reached in the car, he
turned so that his body camera

14:00.100 --> 14:01.492
faced away from the vehicle.

14:01.536 --> 14:02.972
Are you sure
you didn't see anything?

14:03.016 --> 14:06.410
I saw Troy reaching in the back
and pulling out a vial,

14:06.454 --> 14:08.978
and that gave us cause
to search a vehicle

14:09.022 --> 14:11.111
that had a gun under the seat

14:11.154 --> 14:13.765
that was used
in a double homicide.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.812
That's all you saw?

14:17.857 --> 14:20.207
With these two eyes, yes.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.383
Okay, pretend
it's two years ago.

14:22.426 --> 14:25.081
You and I are still riding
together as partners,

14:25.125 --> 14:26.604
both of us on that scene.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.693
What else might one of us
have noticed?

14:30.826 --> 14:31.958
[sighs]

14:32.001 --> 14:33.916
If Troy played fast
and loose with this,

14:33.960 --> 14:35.918
it's gonna come out.How?

14:35.962 --> 14:37.746
Because if I can't get
to the bottom of it,

14:37.789 --> 14:38.921
I have to make a phone call.

14:39.966 --> 14:42.533
Wha...
Whoa, you're gonna call IAB?

14:42.577 --> 14:44.057
If I suspect
a collar is bad, Eddie,

14:44.100 --> 14:46.189
it is my job to call IAB.Even if it

14:46.233 --> 14:47.582
lets a perp walk?

14:47.625 --> 14:50.106
And jams me up in the process?

14:50.150 --> 14:51.194
You'll be just fine.And so will

14:51.238 --> 14:52.717
the perp.

14:52.761 --> 14:55.285
Fine and dandy
out on the street.

14:57.853 --> 15:00.029
I can't look the other way
on this.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.773
â™ª

15:04.816 --> 15:07.950
[siren wailing]WARREN: You are notgoing
to take him, okay?

15:07.994 --> 15:09.778
Calm down, for God's sake.I did everything

15:09.821 --> 15:11.171
I was supposed to do!Calm down, Warren.

15:11.214 --> 15:12.955
Hey! Hey, hey!
Settle down!Why are you doing this?

15:12.999 --> 15:14.130
Settle down!

15:14.174 --> 15:15.784
Shut your mouth
and settle down.Danny...

15:15.827 --> 15:17.003
Please...DANNY:
What the hell

15:17.046 --> 15:18.047
is going on here?

15:19.092 --> 15:21.094
Karen got a job offer in L.A.

15:21.137 --> 15:24.053
She told Andrew,
who texted his dad.

15:24.097 --> 15:25.228
I'm sorry, Warren.

15:25.272 --> 15:26.577
I didn't want you
to find out like this.

15:26.621 --> 15:27.709
You're not taking my son!

15:27.752 --> 15:29.667
Hey! Hey![cries out]

15:29.711 --> 15:32.192
Dad! Please! Don't hurt him.It's okay.
Nobody's gonna hurt him.

15:32.235 --> 15:33.106
[grunts]

15:33.149 --> 15:34.759
Let me talk to him.No, no.

15:34.803 --> 15:36.761
We're done talking.
Get him out of here.

15:40.243 --> 15:41.723
Get him out of here.
Come on.

15:41.766 --> 15:44.204
It's okay, Andy. It's okay.

15:44.247 --> 15:46.510
Go.
It's okay.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.034
It's okay, Andy.
It's okay, Andy.

15:48.077 --> 15:50.427
[engine starts]

15:50.471 --> 15:53.039
[siren wailing]

15:53.082 --> 15:55.258
[vehicle departing]

16:05.007 --> 16:06.574
I gave you a break,

16:06.617 --> 16:09.490
but you just couldn't leave
well enough alone, could you?

16:09.533 --> 16:12.058
I needed to talk to Karen.

16:12.101 --> 16:13.320
You call that talking?

16:13.363 --> 16:16.540
Look, you have to put yourself
in my place.

16:18.151 --> 16:20.718
She's trying to drag my son
across the country.Well,

16:20.762 --> 16:23.504
even if a judge allows that,
you-you get yourself a lawyer,

16:23.547 --> 16:26.463
you work out a custody situation
that you can live with.

16:26.507 --> 16:28.988
I'm a convicted felon.

16:29.031 --> 16:31.033
What kind of custody deal
am I gonna get?

16:31.077 --> 16:34.036
I don't know. But that's
the least of your worries now.

16:36.604 --> 16:39.041
Do you think they're
gonna send me back to jail?

16:39.085 --> 16:41.174
Well, you sure as hell
would deserve it.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.050
What's going on?

16:48.094 --> 16:50.574
Got Warren's
desk appearance ticket.

16:54.796 --> 16:57.190
That mutt deserves
to stay locked up

16:57.233 --> 16:59.018
until his parole
violation hearing.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.497
Disagree.He's an ex-con

17:00.541 --> 17:03.326
with a drug problem who
threatened his family, and now

17:03.370 --> 17:05.067
he just bought himself
an order of protection.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.373
He screwed up.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.114
Now he's trying
to set things right.Okay,

17:08.157 --> 17:11.073
but you can't go ballistic
every time you get a bad break.

17:11.117 --> 17:12.379
[chuckles]:
Look who's talking.

17:13.728 --> 17:15.295
[quietly]:
This guy is not a perp.

17:15.338 --> 17:18.341
He's trying to save his family.

17:23.129 --> 17:24.956
Cut him loose.

17:26.219 --> 17:29.048
You take one step out of line,
I'm gonna be there,

17:29.091 --> 17:30.919
and I'm gonna bust your ass!

17:40.450 --> 17:42.061
Thank you.

17:43.105 --> 17:46.239
The arresting officer,
Bruce Zarrelli,

17:46.282 --> 17:48.067
is an 11-year veteran

17:48.110 --> 17:50.112
with a clean and
solid record.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.331
There you go.

17:51.374 --> 17:53.594
Except for being named
in a complaint

17:53.637 --> 17:56.075
a couple of years back
in a brawl

17:56.118 --> 17:58.642
between NYPD officers
and firefighters

17:58.686 --> 18:00.122
that broke out in
the emergency room

18:00.166 --> 18:02.124
where they were being treated
at St. Luke's.

18:02.168 --> 18:03.125
What are the chances?

18:03.169 --> 18:04.474
Of what?Well,

18:04.518 --> 18:08.565
another run-in with the FDNY
out of 35,000 cops?

18:08.609 --> 18:10.567
Zarrelli also coaches
youth hockey

18:10.611 --> 18:13.135
for the Police Sports League's
program.

18:13.179 --> 18:15.398
He gives back. See?

18:15.442 --> 18:17.139
And?

18:17.183 --> 18:22.101
Andplays as a defenseman
for the NYPD's hockey squad.

18:23.189 --> 18:25.060
And?

18:26.105 --> 18:27.671
In three of the last five

18:27.715 --> 18:30.718
NYPD-versus-FDNY
annual hockey games,

18:30.761 --> 18:34.156
he's been ejected
for misconduct.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.288
For fighting.

18:37.246 --> 18:40.162
[laughs]: It's hockey;
it's a contact sport.

18:40.206 --> 18:42.164
This supports Rourke's claim
that he was singled out.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.948
Rourke laid on hands,
not our guy.

18:43.992 --> 18:45.211
The collar was solid.

18:45.254 --> 18:46.473
That's not how it's
gonna read in the papers.

18:46.516 --> 18:49.084
Any way you slice it,
Rourke still messed up.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.304
Any way you slice it, so did we.

18:54.307 --> 18:55.699
[sighs]

18:55.743 --> 18:57.614
Mayor Chase and I
only met yesterday.

18:57.658 --> 18:59.181
He thought it went well.

18:59.225 --> 19:00.835
He gave a review?

19:00.878 --> 19:02.184
You confirmed his opinion of you

19:02.228 --> 19:04.143
based on our research,
that's all.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.796
Oh.
If it seems
like he flies

19:05.840 --> 19:07.755
by the seat of his pants,
he doesn't.

19:07.798 --> 19:10.149
No, I...He just finds it useful
to give that impression.

19:13.021 --> 19:15.154
I haven't made a decision.

19:15.197 --> 19:16.677
It's been a day.
I'd hope not.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.201
Right.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.159
[smacks lips]

19:20.202 --> 19:21.812
So why am I here?

19:21.856 --> 19:23.945
Because Peter Chase thinks
you'd make a great D.A.,

19:23.988 --> 19:25.990
and I've been in the room
since day one.

19:26.034 --> 19:28.254
What is day one, by the way?First store he opened.

19:28.297 --> 19:29.907
While he was cutting
the ribbon out front,

19:29.951 --> 19:32.606
I was out back still duking
it out with the Teamsters boss.

19:32.649 --> 19:35.261
And your research on me,
what does it say?

19:35.304 --> 19:36.871
Top of the waves?

19:36.914 --> 19:39.221
A lot of positives
with one big unknown.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.657
What is that?

19:40.701 --> 19:42.442
Do you want it and how badly.

19:42.485 --> 19:44.052
I don't know that yet.

19:44.095 --> 19:45.096
I knew that

19:45.140 --> 19:46.707
from the moment we shook hands.

19:48.361 --> 19:50.450
Do you have any advice for me?

19:50.493 --> 19:52.147
What kind?

19:52.191 --> 19:54.018
What kinds are there?It boils down

19:54.062 --> 19:56.020
to what you want to hear
and what you need to hear.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.500
[sighs]:
Okay.

19:57.544 --> 19:59.546
What I need to hear.

20:01.548 --> 20:03.202
I'm a car guy.

20:03.245 --> 20:06.030
Family and friends, they come
to me when it's that time.

20:06.074 --> 20:07.858
One thing I always tell them...

20:07.902 --> 20:09.295
Okay?

20:09.338 --> 20:12.254
Never buy the first year
of a new model's production.

20:12.298 --> 20:15.344
Wait at least
until the second cycle.

20:16.302 --> 20:18.304
I've got a car I like.

20:18.347 --> 20:19.609
Exactly.

20:19.653 --> 20:22.221
You've got a good job
and one you excel in.

20:22.264 --> 20:24.875
Peter Chase as mayor
is still a month and a half

20:24.919 --> 20:26.355
from the showroom floor.

20:26.399 --> 20:27.835
You'd be buying into something

20:27.878 --> 20:30.925
no one's had the chance
to even drive around the block.

20:35.756 --> 20:37.236
You're in early.

20:37.279 --> 20:38.889
Got a call from IAB.

20:38.933 --> 20:40.326
I figured you would.

20:40.369 --> 20:42.415
They're investigating
the Phelps collar.

20:42.458 --> 20:43.633
I'm getting called in.

20:43.677 --> 20:45.592
Like I said, just
tell the truth.

20:45.635 --> 20:47.420
The truth is

20:47.463 --> 20:49.596
that a really bad guy's
off the streets.

20:49.639 --> 20:51.598
But that's the
result, Eddie.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.687
The question is
how it went down.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.384
I don't want
to jam anybody up.

20:55.428 --> 20:56.864
I get that. But
if the evidence

20:56.907 --> 20:59.083
that allowed Troy to search
that car was planted...

20:59.127 --> 21:01.477
I don't know that it was,
and neither do you.

21:01.521 --> 21:04.393
You don't know,
but you have doubts.

21:04.437 --> 21:07.440
What I have is
my partner's back.

21:07.483 --> 21:08.745
Just like I had yours.

21:08.789 --> 21:10.660
The difference is I
never crossed the line.

21:10.704 --> 21:13.576
Kenneth Troy is a good cop.Even good cops screw up.

21:13.620 --> 21:16.231
So we're just gonna
let him hang out to dry?

21:16.275 --> 21:18.842
If Troy broke the law, then
he needs to answer for that,

21:18.886 --> 21:20.888
same as the alleged
shooter that you collared.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.455
Well, no, it's not the same.

21:22.498 --> 21:24.108
Phelps is a murderer.

21:24.152 --> 21:27.416
And Troy has given his life
to this department.

21:27.460 --> 21:28.852
You're right.
It's not the same.

21:28.896 --> 21:30.245
Troy's worse.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.595
Well, how do you figure that?

21:32.639 --> 21:34.162
Because he took an oath.

21:34.205 --> 21:36.338
Because when you put on the
uniform, you ask the public

21:36.382 --> 21:38.601
to entrust you with
upholding the law,

21:38.645 --> 21:40.908
so you should know better.

21:42.344 --> 21:45.086
The same goes for anyone
who covers for him.

21:51.571 --> 21:53.181
[clears throat]

21:53.224 --> 21:54.878
Detective Reagan,
what are you doing here?

21:54.922 --> 21:56.489
I could ask you
the same thing.

21:56.532 --> 21:58.229
You do realize
you're in violation

21:58.273 --> 21:59.535
of the order of
protection, correct?

21:59.579 --> 22:01.972
No, no, no. I got a message
from Karen at work,

22:02.016 --> 22:03.365
and she asked me
to come over.

22:03.409 --> 22:04.540
I'm sure she did.

22:04.584 --> 22:06.499
I'm serious.
You got to believe me.

22:06.542 --> 22:07.804
Doesn't matter what I believe.

22:07.848 --> 22:09.110
You're under arrest. Let's go.

22:09.153 --> 22:10.285
Hands against the car.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.460
What are you...?Just go.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.462
Right now!

22:19.294 --> 22:21.078
Turn around.

22:21.122 --> 22:23.124
Stay right here.

22:24.952 --> 22:28.042
Let me guess. You just happened
to be in the neighborhood?

22:28.085 --> 22:31.132
Warren texted me,
said Karen wanted to meet.

22:31.175 --> 22:34.483
I called Karen,
she knew nothing about it.

22:34.527 --> 22:36.833
Yeah, sounds like
your boy made it up.

22:36.877 --> 22:38.400
Or someone sent a fake message

22:38.444 --> 22:40.620
so he'd violate
his order of protection.

22:40.663 --> 22:42.056
Well, that sounds like something

22:42.099 --> 22:43.884
you'dprobably do
back in your glory days.

22:43.927 --> 22:45.407
More than once.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.366
But setting people up
is the kind of thing

22:47.409 --> 22:48.845
you can get busted for.

22:48.889 --> 22:50.847
Is that a threat?

22:50.891 --> 22:53.372
You take him in based
on a fixed setup?

22:53.415 --> 22:55.417
It's a promise.

22:55.461 --> 22:57.419
[chuckles]

22:59.813 --> 23:01.815
Okay.

23:01.858 --> 23:04.295
But if he kills his wife,
it's on you.

23:04.339 --> 23:07.864
Get the hell out of here. Now!

23:07.908 --> 23:09.431
Stay away.

23:11.825 --> 23:12.652
[car door closes]

23:18.571 --> 23:20.050
When?

23:20.094 --> 23:21.617
GORMLEY:
About an hour
and a half ago.

23:21.661 --> 23:24.446
Apparently, both our guys and
their guys started jawboning

23:24.490 --> 23:27.536
at each other, but the
bosses on scene got ahold

23:27.580 --> 23:29.016
before anything physical
started.

23:29.059 --> 23:31.410
And we can assume
that the cell phones were out

23:31.453 --> 23:34.456
and that the jawboning'll be
all bleeps on the 5:00 news.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.459
I got nothing but bleeps
for this right now.BAKER: But they were able

23:37.503 --> 23:40.419
to secure the scene together
without any real incident?Yes.

23:40.462 --> 23:42.986
Yeah. This time.

23:43.030 --> 23:45.554
Look, walk down the street,

23:45.598 --> 23:48.035
and ask anyone the name
of the police commissioner

23:48.078 --> 23:49.950
and the fire commissioner,
what do you get?

23:49.993 --> 23:50.994
BAKER:
"Frank Reagan,"

23:51.038 --> 23:52.039
and, "I don't know."

23:52.082 --> 23:53.562
Exactly. Look,
I'd have a chip

23:53.606 --> 23:56.260
on my shoulder, too, if I was
"Commissioner I Don't Know."

23:56.304 --> 23:58.262
So would any of you.So what?

23:58.306 --> 24:00.656
Well, Lieutenant, we are going

24:00.700 --> 24:04.878
to do something about this thing
with our guys and their guys

24:04.921 --> 24:07.707
before it spills out
onto the street.

24:07.750 --> 24:10.666
Okay, but what about our guy?Our hockey player?

24:10.710 --> 24:12.668
Yeah. We gonna just let him
hang out to dry?

24:12.712 --> 24:14.975
This tradition--

24:15.018 --> 24:18.761
I know the rank and file likes
to play it on both sides--

24:18.805 --> 24:20.589
but I got nothing for it.

24:20.633 --> 24:22.765
So... what?

24:22.809 --> 24:24.985
We ask him
to take one for the team.

24:25.028 --> 24:26.987
JAMIE:
You've been

24:27.030 --> 24:28.467
interviewed
with IAB before.

24:28.510 --> 24:31.513
Yeah, but not with my
partner's career on the line.

24:31.557 --> 24:33.950
You should be worried
about your own career here.

24:33.994 --> 24:36.213
I have you to
thank for that.

24:36.257 --> 24:37.519
I did my job, Eddie.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.173
And it could cost me mine.

24:39.216 --> 24:41.001
IAB is looking
at Troy, not you.

24:41.044 --> 24:42.785
Like that matters.Of course it matters.

24:42.829 --> 24:46.180
Really? I tell IAB the truth--
I didn't see anything--

24:46.223 --> 24:49.183
and Troy still goes down,
I come out smelling like a rat.

24:49.226 --> 24:52.142
Maybe to a few knuckleheads.

24:53.448 --> 24:57.060
Troy has been in that
precinct for 12 years, Jamie.

24:57.104 --> 24:59.976
If he loses his shield,
they're gonna blame that on me.

25:00.020 --> 25:01.500
I did not create
the situation, Eddie.

25:01.543 --> 25:02.979
I did not plant that evidence.

25:03.023 --> 25:05.286
You just called IAB.

25:12.336 --> 25:14.295
[door opens]

25:14.338 --> 25:15.905
[sets cup down]

25:15.949 --> 25:17.341
[door closes]

25:20.170 --> 25:21.476
Hey.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.869
Hey.

25:27.961 --> 25:29.876
Is everything all right?

25:29.919 --> 25:33.140
Yeah, just...
work stuff.

25:33.183 --> 25:35.534
Work stuff about
you running for D.A.?

25:37.144 --> 25:39.102
How did you find out?

25:39.146 --> 25:40.103
[laughs]

25:40.147 --> 25:41.931
Hey, I know guys who know guys.

25:41.975 --> 25:44.586
I thought it was
supposed to be confidential.

25:44.630 --> 25:46.109
Well, by normal
standards, it is,

25:46.153 --> 25:49.156
but one guy knew one
other guy who knew.

25:51.158 --> 25:53.943
[sighs] I wanted to come
to you with it right away.

25:53.987 --> 25:56.076
But you didn't.

25:56.119 --> 25:58.078
I just felt like
it was a decision

25:58.121 --> 25:59.688
I should make on my own.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.691
And I respect that.

26:04.780 --> 26:07.217
I've wanted this my whole life.

26:07.261 --> 26:09.002
Actually, you wanted
to be a jockey

26:09.045 --> 26:10.786
till you were nine years old.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.788
Well, I was already
five-seven by then.

26:12.832 --> 26:14.311
And allergic to horses.

26:14.355 --> 26:18.228
Okay, I have wanted this
my entire adultlife.

26:18.272 --> 26:22.276
And it's past time
that Manhattan has a female D.A.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.279
Well, I think
you'd make a great one.

26:25.322 --> 26:26.802
Nothing to do with gender.

26:26.846 --> 26:28.848
Thank you.

26:28.891 --> 26:30.893
Yeah.

26:32.242 --> 26:34.418
Something to think about.

26:34.462 --> 26:36.246
It is

26:36.290 --> 26:39.119
definitely gonna
turn up the heat around here.

26:39.162 --> 26:41.251
I thought you and I have done
a good job

26:41.295 --> 26:43.645
checking our guns at the door
since I became bureau chief.

26:43.689 --> 26:45.473
Yes,

26:45.516 --> 26:47.606
but there is the rest
of the family.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.174
What do you mean?

26:51.218 --> 26:53.655
Well, they've lived
in the public eye

26:53.699 --> 26:55.614
for as long as I can remember,

26:55.657 --> 26:57.659
but you choose to stand

26:57.703 --> 26:59.618
for public office.

27:00.923 --> 27:04.013
The scrutiny will go
through the roof. I know.

27:04.057 --> 27:06.494
Look, it's your decision,

27:06.537 --> 27:08.627
as it should be.

27:10.367 --> 27:12.326
We'll support what you do.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.374
JANKO:
Wow.

27:17.418 --> 27:19.159
District attorney.
Oh!
All right, Erin.

27:19.202 --> 27:21.161
[overlapping chatter]

27:21.204 --> 27:22.945
Look at you.I appreciate the support,

27:22.989 --> 27:25.208
but I haven't made
a decision yet.

27:25.252 --> 27:26.253
Well, what the heck
are you waiting for?

27:26.296 --> 27:27.863
It's a job
you were born to do.

27:27.907 --> 27:29.996
HENRY: Yeah.Be nice to have a friend
to cops in that office.

27:30.039 --> 27:31.475
For once.

27:31.519 --> 27:33.956
It's a complicated
decision for all of us.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.610
What do you mean,
all of us?

27:35.654 --> 27:37.568
Well...

27:37.612 --> 27:39.701
a lot of hard
questions get asked,

27:39.745 --> 27:41.964
and the answers get checked
and double-checked.

27:42.008 --> 27:44.619
Folks sticking their noses
where they don't belong.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.970
And nothing's out of bounds,
and I mean nothing.

27:48.014 --> 27:49.929
Yeah, but we've all dealt
with the press before.

27:49.972 --> 27:52.018
It's not the press.
They're at least visible.

27:52.061 --> 27:53.759
It's the opposition research,

27:53.802 --> 27:55.195
stuff on any
and all of us

27:55.238 --> 27:57.588
that can just surface
out of nowhere.

27:57.632 --> 27:59.199
So, you're telling me
that the Russians

27:59.242 --> 28:01.244
are gonna be making
stuff up about me online?

28:01.288 --> 28:04.334
I doubt it, but before
I make a decision,

28:04.378 --> 28:07.598
I would like to know
that you guys are all on board.

28:07.642 --> 28:09.122
100%.JANKO: Yeah.
Yeah.

28:09.165 --> 28:10.253
Of course.JANKO: Yeah.

28:10.297 --> 28:11.254
On board.And if there's

28:11.298 --> 28:13.169
anything I should know,

28:13.213 --> 28:14.954
anything that could
raise a red flag,

28:14.997 --> 28:16.651
now would be the time.

28:16.695 --> 28:20.307
You mean like my dad
being a convicted felon?

28:20.350 --> 28:22.439
Well, that's already
out in the open.

28:22.483 --> 28:23.789
Could it hurt you?

28:23.832 --> 28:24.920
I doubt it.

28:24.964 --> 28:27.401
And that's on him, not on you.

28:27.444 --> 28:29.446
Yeah.I got accused
of roughing up a clown

28:29.490 --> 28:32.058
who doused some cops with water,
which made all the news.

28:32.101 --> 28:34.277
Well, that guy only got half
of what he had coming to him.

28:34.321 --> 28:35.496
And again, it's known.

28:35.539 --> 28:37.411
HENRY:
Yeah.

28:37.454 --> 28:39.456
Cat got your tongue?

28:39.500 --> 28:41.894
I'm thinking.

28:41.937 --> 28:43.243
This may take a while.

28:43.286 --> 28:44.853
Well, you all know

28:44.897 --> 28:47.464
I may have stepped on the line
once or twice in my career.

28:47.508 --> 28:49.858
And Dillinger robbed a bank
one or two times.

28:49.902 --> 28:52.078
Hey, I'll stack Danny's record

28:52.121 --> 28:53.601
against any detective
on the job.

28:53.644 --> 28:54.776
Thank you, Dad.
Mm.

28:54.820 --> 28:56.517
And I have a clear conscience
about it,

28:56.560 --> 28:58.301
so I say you should go for it.

28:58.345 --> 29:01.522
Grandpa, anything I should know?

29:01.565 --> 29:02.958
I'll take the Fifth.

29:03.002 --> 29:04.090
FRANK: Hmm.Oh.

29:04.133 --> 29:05.439
Does a fake I.D. count?

29:05.482 --> 29:06.440
What?

29:06.483 --> 29:08.442
I think you're okay.

29:08.485 --> 29:10.357
Hopefully, yours is better
than your dad's.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.141
What?
Oh.JAMIE: Yeah. What was

29:12.185 --> 29:14.230
the name on that thing?"Marion Morrison."

29:14.274 --> 29:16.450
ALL:
Marion?

29:16.493 --> 29:17.712
JANKO:
Seriously?

29:17.756 --> 29:19.409
It's John Wayne's name
in real life.

29:19.453 --> 29:20.671
Who?

29:20.715 --> 29:22.978
That's sad.

29:23.022 --> 29:24.806
And if those are the only

29:24.850 --> 29:26.590
skeletons in the
closet, you know what?

29:26.634 --> 29:29.506
I'd say you're good to go.

29:29.550 --> 29:31.552
DANNY:
Yeah.

29:31.595 --> 29:32.553
Yes.HENRY:
Good to go.

29:32.596 --> 29:34.163
Do it.Thank you, everyone.

29:34.207 --> 29:35.686
Pass the potatoes, Marion.

29:35.730 --> 29:38.559
[laughter]

29:39.603 --> 29:41.431
DANNY:
Well, Gramps,

29:41.475 --> 29:44.565
I sure hope your boy Davis
is behaving himself.

29:44.608 --> 29:46.393
I'll take his behavior
over yours.

29:48.134 --> 29:49.439
Wait for me in the car.

29:52.529 --> 29:55.489
Do you mind telling me
what happened to Henry Reagan?

29:55.532 --> 29:57.578
'Cause this bleeding heart
I've been riding

29:57.621 --> 30:00.102
around with the last few days--
I have no idea who he is.

30:00.146 --> 30:02.496
Domestic violence cases
are loaded with landmines.

30:02.539 --> 30:03.497
Uh-huh.

30:03.540 --> 30:05.499
You got to walk softly.

30:05.542 --> 30:06.848
Well, I know that, Gramps.

30:06.892 --> 30:08.458
That's exactly my point.

30:08.502 --> 30:10.243
You know, this isn't
my first rodeo.

30:10.286 --> 30:12.680
Problem is, you're acting like
the bull and not the rider.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.464
But if this guy Davis
goes off on his wife,

30:14.508 --> 30:15.726
he could do serious damage.

30:15.770 --> 30:17.511
He's never hurt
anyone in his life.

30:17.554 --> 30:19.426
But if he goes
back to jail,

30:19.469 --> 30:21.123
it'll do some real damage
to his son.

30:21.167 --> 30:22.646
Well, I think he should have
thought about that

30:22.690 --> 30:23.909
before he became a junkie.

30:23.952 --> 30:25.388
Look, Gramps,

30:25.432 --> 30:27.826
I became a cop in
the first place because of you

30:27.869 --> 30:29.653
and the stories you told
about the old days

30:29.697 --> 30:31.177
when cops didn't look
over their shoulders,

30:31.220 --> 30:32.918
and they did
what they had to do.

30:32.961 --> 30:34.745
Watching you work this case
makes me wish

30:34.789 --> 30:37.487
I'd kept those stories
to myself.

30:41.230 --> 30:42.623
Well, if that's how you feel,

30:42.666 --> 30:44.625
I'll ride solo on the Davis case
from here on in.

30:44.668 --> 30:46.496
I'll do the same.Good.

30:48.455 --> 30:50.022
[door closes]

30:56.898 --> 30:58.465
Detective Reagan?

30:58.508 --> 31:00.554
[crying]:
This is all my fault.

31:00.597 --> 31:02.643
What-what happened?
What's your fault?

31:02.686 --> 31:04.863
I went to pick up Andrew
from soccer practice,

31:04.906 --> 31:07.474
and his coach said that
Warren had already taken him.

31:07.517 --> 31:08.823
Taken him where?I don't know.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.216
And I've been calling
their cell phones,

31:10.259 --> 31:11.870
and neither one of them
is picking up.

31:11.913 --> 31:13.828
Well, didn't the teachers know
about the order of protection?

31:13.872 --> 31:15.830
Well, with everything going on,
I didn't have a chance.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.571
I can't believe
this is happening.

31:17.614 --> 31:19.138
Wait a minute. Wait.
It's not your fault, okay?

31:19.181 --> 31:20.922
What I need you to do
is take a breath.

31:20.966 --> 31:22.924
All right? I'm gonna have this
officer take your complaint.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.926
I promise you I'll find him.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.929
Go ahead.Right this way.

31:31.977 --> 31:32.803
You heard?

31:32.847 --> 31:34.718
Yeah.You know,

31:34.762 --> 31:36.851
if he was locked up
like I wanted him to be,

31:36.895 --> 31:38.200
this would never
have happened.

31:38.244 --> 31:40.202
And he wouldn't keep
acting like a perp

31:40.246 --> 31:42.117
if you didn't keep
treating him like one.

31:42.161 --> 31:44.206
[chuckles] So you're
saying this is my fault?

31:44.250 --> 31:47.601
What I'm saying is this guy
is not who you think he is.

31:47.644 --> 31:48.863
I don't give a damn who he is.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.256
I got to go find this guy

31:50.299 --> 31:52.954
a-and the son that
he just kidnapped!

31:52.998 --> 31:54.564
I know where they are.You...

31:54.608 --> 31:55.914
[exhales]

31:55.957 --> 31:57.828
Well, do you plan on telling me?

31:57.872 --> 31:59.656
Oh, I thought
we were going solo.

31:59.700 --> 32:02.094
[whispers]:
Oh, my God, Gramps.

32:02.137 --> 32:03.704
You drive.

32:03.747 --> 32:05.749
Gladly.

32:09.231 --> 32:11.755
Ever go as BeyoncÃ©
for Halloween?

32:12.974 --> 32:13.932
Blackface.

32:13.975 --> 32:14.933
Uh, no.

32:14.976 --> 32:16.412
Run around topless

32:16.456 --> 32:18.197
at Burning Man?
Anything like that?

32:18.240 --> 32:20.112
No, I like to wear clothes
in public.

32:20.155 --> 32:21.678
It's kind of my thing.

32:21.722 --> 32:23.985
Your ex-husband have any beefs
he's been waiting to air?

32:24.029 --> 32:26.205
We've aired them all, so no.

32:26.248 --> 32:27.902
Daughter Nicky, any skeletons?

32:27.946 --> 32:29.904
Not that I know of.This is all about

32:29.948 --> 32:31.514
what you do know of.

32:31.558 --> 32:33.081
You can't prevent surprises.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.909
You can only anticipate them.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.085
Right.

32:37.129 --> 32:39.653
A run for anything these days
is like a daily colonoscopy.

32:39.696 --> 32:42.221
But the model I made
from researching you

32:42.264 --> 32:43.657
is the best kind.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.311
Between your personal conduct

32:45.354 --> 32:47.052
and the record of service
in your family,

32:47.095 --> 32:49.924
there are offsets for almost any
situation that could rear up.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.752
That's good.

32:51.795 --> 32:54.059
Depends on
what you're looking for.

32:54.102 --> 32:55.669
What does that mean?

32:55.712 --> 32:57.845
Means if you're looking
at the scrutiny

32:57.888 --> 33:00.413
as an excuse
not to pursue the office,

33:00.456 --> 33:02.937
the scrutiny ain't much of one.

33:02.981 --> 33:06.027
Who said I was looking
for an excuse?

33:08.725 --> 33:11.119
Isn't that
what you're doing here?

33:15.341 --> 33:17.517
You wanted
to see me, Sarge?

33:17.560 --> 33:19.345
Yeah.

33:19.388 --> 33:20.868
How you holding up?

33:20.911 --> 33:23.044
You mean
the IAB dog and pony?

33:23.088 --> 33:25.003
Yeah.Yeah. It's no problem.

33:25.046 --> 33:26.526
How long you been
on the job now?

33:26.569 --> 33:27.701
19 years.

33:27.744 --> 33:28.876
That's a damn good run.

33:28.919 --> 33:30.269
You should be proud.

33:30.312 --> 33:32.271
Thank you, sir.

33:32.314 --> 33:33.968
Some guys,

33:34.012 --> 33:36.623
they don't know
when to hang it up.

33:36.666 --> 33:39.539
You don't seem like
that kind of guy.

33:41.541 --> 33:43.543
I guess.

33:46.633 --> 33:48.113
[door closes]

33:50.724 --> 33:52.856
The job takes its toll.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.771
I've heard of seasoned cops
throwing procedure

33:54.815 --> 33:57.600
out the window
to take down a perp.

33:57.644 --> 33:59.211
Oh, yeah?

33:59.254 --> 34:01.474
Yeah, and jamming up
their partners in the process.

34:01.517 --> 34:04.564
Look, I... I don't know
what Janko told you,

34:04.607 --> 34:06.044
but I didn't do anything wrong.

34:06.087 --> 34:07.175
Janko didn't tell me anything.

34:07.219 --> 34:08.829
She didn't need to.

34:08.872 --> 34:10.831
A cadet could look at that
collar and know something

34:10.874 --> 34:12.137
wasn't right.Yeah, but IAB's

34:12.180 --> 34:13.964
still got to prove it, right?And if they do,

34:14.008 --> 34:16.097
your partner catches the blame.

34:16.141 --> 34:18.491
Sarge, chances are
Phelps killed two people.

34:18.534 --> 34:19.492
Mm-hmm.

34:19.535 --> 34:21.015
Probably more before that.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.234
Now he's off the street.

34:22.277 --> 34:24.279
Which doesn't justify
what you did.

34:26.064 --> 34:28.327
And IAB's gonna
take your shield for it.

34:28.370 --> 34:30.155
But there's a way out.

34:30.198 --> 34:31.765
What is that?

34:31.808 --> 34:33.593
You put your papers in. Today.

34:33.636 --> 34:35.116
No way. No way.

34:35.160 --> 34:36.596
I'm not quitting.Suit yourself.

34:36.639 --> 34:39.425
But if you go down for this,
they'll take your pension.

34:39.468 --> 34:42.384
You walk on your own,
you can keep it.

34:42.428 --> 34:44.647
And your reputation.

34:50.436 --> 34:52.829
All right, can I have some time
to think about this?

34:52.873 --> 34:54.831
You got the time it takes
to get to that door.

35:00.010 --> 35:02.535
All right, I'll...

35:02.578 --> 35:05.625
put my papers in
by the end of the day.

35:16.201 --> 35:18.203
[door closes]

35:25.166 --> 35:26.559
Those the two
you're looking for?

35:26.602 --> 35:28.474
Yeah, that's them.

35:31.085 --> 35:33.174
How'd you know
he'd bring him here?

35:33.218 --> 35:36.177
Warren told me that the best
memory he had of his old man

35:36.221 --> 35:37.483
was coming to the Garden

35:37.526 --> 35:39.485
and he was sorry that he
never brought Andrew.

35:42.227 --> 35:44.751
Guess you were right about
all that touchy-feely stuff.

35:44.794 --> 35:46.796
Go figure.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.276
You want me to pull
'em from their seats?

35:50.148 --> 35:51.323
You're the cop.

35:51.366 --> 35:52.672
[sighs]

35:52.715 --> 35:53.890
Nah.

35:53.934 --> 35:55.979
Let 'em enjoy
the game.

35:56.023 --> 35:58.895
I'll call the mom
and let her know the kid's okay.

35:58.939 --> 36:00.723
But do you think you could
score us a couple of seats

36:00.767 --> 36:02.072
so we can keep
an eye on 'em?

36:02.116 --> 36:04.771
No problem.Thanks.

36:07.643 --> 36:10.559
Sometimes there
is no bad guy.

36:12.387 --> 36:13.954
I should've listened to you.

36:13.997 --> 36:16.696
I'm... sorry I didn't.

36:16.739 --> 36:18.088
Talk's cheap.

36:22.528 --> 36:23.485
Two dogs,

36:23.529 --> 36:26.053
fries and a
beer, right?

36:26.096 --> 36:27.837
Don't forget the Red Vines.

36:27.881 --> 36:30.231
Right.

36:30.275 --> 36:33.016
[chuckles softly]

36:33.060 --> 36:35.932
â™ª

36:38.413 --> 36:39.458
Hey.

36:39.501 --> 36:40.807
Hey yourself.

36:41.851 --> 36:44.724
Troy put in his papers today.

36:44.767 --> 36:46.595
Yeah. So I hear.

36:46.639 --> 36:49.250
Lets me off the hook
in a big way.

36:49.294 --> 36:50.860
Yeah, you caught a nice break.

36:51.905 --> 36:53.080
How'd you do it?

36:53.123 --> 36:55.256
[exhales]
What are you talking about?

36:57.563 --> 36:59.956
I just laid out the facts.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.480
Troy made his own decision.

37:01.523 --> 37:04.004
And likely saved my career
in the process.

37:04.047 --> 37:05.962
Thanks to you.

37:06.006 --> 37:07.268
Yeah, well,
I put you in the fire,

37:07.312 --> 37:09.183
so least I could do
was pull you back out.

37:09.227 --> 37:13.143
Mm. It was a tough situation
all around.

37:13.187 --> 37:15.450
99 times out of 100,

37:15.494 --> 37:17.235
I go by the book.

37:17.278 --> 37:20.020
I make that call to IAB.I know.

37:20.063 --> 37:22.936
Well, but the trouble is you're
the one time that I shouldn't.

37:23.980 --> 37:25.852
You did what you thought
was right.

37:25.895 --> 37:26.940
Yeah, but that's
not good enough.

37:26.983 --> 37:29.116
Not when it comes to you.

37:29.159 --> 37:30.291
I messed up.

37:30.335 --> 37:32.989
I'm sorry.

37:33.033 --> 37:35.253
In the end,

37:35.296 --> 37:39.082
you had my back,
like you always do.

37:39.126 --> 37:43.348
We knew working together
was not gonna be easy.

37:43.391 --> 37:45.524
Yeah, but family comes first.

37:45.567 --> 37:47.308
You come first.

37:47.352 --> 37:49.832
I never doubted that.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.232
ANNIE:
Um, I-I have...

37:58.276 --> 37:59.189
[footsteps approaching]

37:59.233 --> 38:00.278
Hi.

38:00.321 --> 38:02.062
I really was in
the neighborhood.

38:02.105 --> 38:03.846
Had a meeting with the D.A.

38:03.890 --> 38:05.544
How'd that go?

38:05.587 --> 38:07.459
[chuckles]:
Oh, I don't think he likes me.

38:07.502 --> 38:08.851
What makes you say that?[door closes]

38:08.895 --> 38:10.331
He did that thing they do

38:10.375 --> 38:12.290
where they compare an
entrepreneur in elected office

38:12.333 --> 38:16.119
to calling an auto mechanic
to do your hip replacement.

38:16.163 --> 38:19.079
You know, I'm not
a professional politician.

38:19.122 --> 38:19.906
He said that?

38:19.949 --> 38:21.081
In so many words.

38:21.124 --> 38:22.474
So, not in those words--

38:22.517 --> 38:24.302
just close enough
that you could bend it that way?

38:27.479 --> 38:29.307
Mm.

38:29.350 --> 38:32.875
My wife Vanessa and our boys,
Gavin and Julian.

38:32.919 --> 38:35.095
Beautiful family.

38:35.138 --> 38:36.401
Second wife.

38:36.444 --> 38:38.838
Married 15 years.

38:38.881 --> 38:41.362
Made all my mistakes
first time around.

38:41.406 --> 38:43.886
And you're telling me that why?

38:43.930 --> 38:46.672
My interest in you

38:46.715 --> 38:50.328
is purely collegial
and will never be anything but.

38:51.416 --> 38:52.982
It's important, in this climate,

38:53.026 --> 38:54.288
to get that out in the open.

38:54.332 --> 38:57.770
Plus, it's the truth.

38:57.813 --> 38:59.467
I believe you.

38:59.511 --> 39:02.557
Good. You should.

39:04.037 --> 39:06.213
I don't have a decision.

39:06.256 --> 39:08.041
I don't have a deadline.

39:08.084 --> 39:10.173
I'm gonna wait
until after you're sworn in.

39:10.217 --> 39:12.088
If I did have a deadline,

39:12.132 --> 39:13.655
that would be past it.

39:13.699 --> 39:16.266
Are either
of the other two prosecutors

39:16.310 --> 39:20.096
that you've approached aware
that you're playing the field?

39:20.140 --> 39:23.926
That hasn't come up in any
of my conversations,

39:23.970 --> 39:25.450
including the one
I had with you.

39:25.493 --> 39:26.668
How do you know?

39:26.712 --> 39:30.019
I know guys who know guys.

39:30.063 --> 39:33.022
Course you do.

39:33.066 --> 39:35.677
So let's be really clear.

39:35.721 --> 39:38.898
I like you for this,

39:38.941 --> 39:40.552
and I'm guessing
you've rehearsed

39:40.595 --> 39:43.816
a D.A.'s version of an
Oscar acceptance speech

39:43.859 --> 39:46.688
in front of a mirror
more than once.

39:48.690 --> 39:51.345
The people I believe in,

39:51.389 --> 39:53.478
I don't pave the way.

39:53.521 --> 39:57.177
I throw as many obstacles
as I can inthe way,

39:57.220 --> 39:59.440
see if they got
what I think they do.

40:00.485 --> 40:03.183
Understood.

40:04.227 --> 40:05.968
See you.

40:06.012 --> 40:08.493
I hope.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.630
Uh, I'd like to thank everyone
for coming out.

40:15.674 --> 40:18.328
Always happy to celebrate
my birthday

40:18.372 --> 40:21.070
with my fellow FDNY brothers

40:21.114 --> 40:23.159
and sisters.

40:23.203 --> 40:25.335
Let's hope the judge
goes easy on me.

40:25.379 --> 40:26.467
[laughter]

40:27.468 --> 40:28.426
SlÃ¡inte mhaith.

40:28.469 --> 40:31.167
OTHERS:
SlÃ¡inte mhaith.

40:31.211 --> 40:33.300
WOMAN: Oh, boy,
look who just walked in.MAN: Oh, it's that guy.

40:33.343 --> 40:35.694
[others murmuring]

40:35.737 --> 40:37.347
WOMAN:
What does he want?

40:37.391 --> 40:39.393
[murmuring continues]

40:42.048 --> 40:44.659
Sorry to crash your party.

40:44.703 --> 40:47.445
Sorry to say I'm
getting used to it.

40:48.533 --> 40:50.317
This is Officer Bruce Zarrelli.

40:50.360 --> 40:53.015
Yeah. We've met.

40:53.059 --> 40:54.887
Officer?

40:55.931 --> 40:57.150
Commissioner Rourke,

40:57.193 --> 40:59.544
I overreacted the other night,

40:59.587 --> 41:01.633
and I'm sorry.

41:01.676 --> 41:03.504
Please accept my apologies.

41:05.245 --> 41:07.029
The D.A.'s dropping
the harassment charges.

41:07.073 --> 41:08.814
You can ignore the summons.

41:08.857 --> 41:10.511
You had a hand in that?

41:10.555 --> 41:13.645
It was the right call.

41:13.688 --> 41:18.780
I'm sorry you felt disrespected
by my people.

41:18.824 --> 41:21.304
[inhales, exhales]

41:21.348 --> 41:24.438
[smacks lips]
I should've kept my cool.

41:27.397 --> 41:28.486
Happy birthday.

41:30.270 --> 41:32.707
Should I get the Bomb Squad
to open this?

41:32.751 --> 41:34.709
[laughter]

41:34.753 --> 41:37.407
Commissioner's courtesy card,
with his cell phone number.

41:37.451 --> 41:39.366
If you need him,
give him a call.

41:39.409 --> 41:41.411
Anytime.

41:43.631 --> 41:45.677
Thank you, Frank.

41:46.939 --> 41:49.332
You're welcome.

41:49.376 --> 41:50.638
Just don't share it

41:50.682 --> 41:52.074
with all these guys.

41:52.118 --> 41:54.642
I don't want to get woken up
ten times a night.

41:54.686 --> 41:56.470
[laughter]

42:04.739 --> 42:06.524
Okay.
