We finally gota
piece of the pie

00:25.508 --> 00:28.028
Fish don't fryin the kitchen

00:28.028 --> 00:30.720
Beans don't burnon the grill

00:30.720 --> 00:33.447
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:33.447 --> 00:36.174
Just to get up that hill

00:36.174 --> 00:38.659
Now we're upin
the big leagues

00:38.659 --> 00:41.248
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:41.248 --> 00:43.836
As long as we
live,it's you and me, baby

00:43.836 --> 00:45.528
There ain't

piece of the pie

01:13.521 --> 01:14.867
Weezy, did you
call the caterers?

01:14.867 --> 01:17.284
Oh, yes, George.
Twice.
Ah, good, good.

01:17.284 --> 01:19.769
Uh, did
they get my order right?

01:19.769 --> 01:21.253
Everything you wanted.

01:21.253 --> 01:24.912
They got the champagne,
the sandwiches,
the pastry plate...

01:24.912 --> 01:26.914
What about those
stupid little things
on the crackers?

01:26.914 --> 01:30.469
Two dozen stupid little
things on crackers.

01:30.469 --> 01:32.678
With all that money
you laying out,
Mr. Jefferson,

01:32.678 --> 01:34.024
you coulda
let me cater it.

01:34.024 --> 01:36.889
Florence, I'm opening a
new office, not a morgue.

01:39.271 --> 01:41.273
Is there something
you don't like
about my cooking?

01:41.273 --> 01:43.275
Yeah, eating it. Ha!

01:44.932 --> 01:49.385
This is so exciting,
George. After all these years,
your own office.

01:49.385 --> 01:52.767
Yeah, that's right.
It took me a long time,
but I'm finally there.

01:52.767 --> 01:55.080
Let's take a look
at my ad again.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.082
Look at that, Weezy.
A whole page!

01:57.082 --> 02:00.637
Uh, are you sure
you didn't overdo
it a little, George?

02:00.637 --> 02:02.570
What are you
talking about?

02:02.570 --> 02:05.815
"Jefferson's Cleaners
Proudly Announces the Opening of
Its New Corporate Offices..."

02:05.815 --> 02:07.368
Uh, not that part,
this part.

02:07.368 --> 02:11.821
"Look For Our Stores
in Chicago, San Francisco,
and Los Angeles."

02:11.821 --> 02:14.824
You don't have stores
in any of those places.

02:14.824 --> 02:17.413
So what? I didn't say
I had a store there,
I just said look for 'em.

02:21.486 --> 02:26.146
I'm surprised you didn't
take two pages and put in
a big picture of yourself.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.252
Hey, that's a great idea!
Why didn't you tell me
that sooner?

02:30.495 --> 02:32.013
I like it.
Uh-huh?

02:32.013 --> 02:34.084
It's just the right size.
Thank you, Florence.

02:34.084 --> 02:35.879
For wrapping the garbage in.

02:37.571 --> 02:40.401
Well, I'm so glad you
finally got an office.

02:40.401 --> 02:43.093
No more running around
from store to store.

02:43.093 --> 02:45.958
No, that's right.
From now on the store
managers come to me.

02:45.958 --> 02:49.893
I can remember
your first office,
in the Queens store.

02:49.893 --> 02:52.310
You had a table and a
phone in the bathroom.

02:52.310 --> 02:56.245
Oh, yeah! I was only
executive in town that
had a chair that flushed.

02:58.557 --> 03:01.457
Hey, I bet that's
where you got the idea
to open up a chain.

03:05.978 --> 03:07.980
Get it? Chain?

03:07.980 --> 03:10.742
Gong, Florence.
Get it? Gong!

03:12.744 --> 03:14.884
I can't wait to see
your new office.

03:14.884 --> 03:18.059
I wish everyone would
hurry up and get here
so we can go.

03:18.059 --> 03:20.338
Me too. I want to know
what you think before
my opening tomorrow.

03:20.338 --> 03:23.651
That's why I invited the
family and some of my friends
over for the sneak preview.

03:23.651 --> 03:25.860
You mean a sneak show-off.

03:25.860 --> 03:29.347
What are you talking,
Weezy? Look, it's the American
dream come true.

03:29.347 --> 03:31.866
Ten years ago
I was this little guy
with one store, right?

03:31.866 --> 03:33.178
Now look at me.

03:33.178 --> 03:35.284
A little guy
with seven stores.

03:36.630 --> 03:38.942
Ha, ha, ha. You can't
get me today, Weezy.

03:38.942 --> 03:41.359
Nothin' can make
me mad today.

03:41.359 --> 03:43.223
In that case,
can I have a raise?

03:43.223 --> 03:44.016
No.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.605
See?
That didn't make me mad.

03:46.605 --> 03:49.815
I was happy to
turn her down.

03:49.815 --> 03:52.473
George, you better
finish dressing.
They'll be here soon.

03:52.473 --> 03:53.957
Oh yeah, that's right!

03:53.957 --> 03:55.752
I can't let my
public down.

04:00.792 --> 04:02.587
Florence, can you
keep a secret?

04:02.587 --> 04:04.244
Only if it ain't worth
telling to nobody.

04:05.417 --> 04:06.936
Then I better not
tell you this secret.

04:06.936 --> 04:09.214
If it's that juicy,
I wanna hear it.

04:09.214 --> 04:10.871
Well...

04:10.871 --> 04:16.083
I got George a present
to celebrate the opening
of his new office.

04:16.083 --> 04:17.636
You just ran out of juice.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.674
It's a gold watch.

04:20.674 --> 04:23.263
Helen is picking it up
for me at the jewelers.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.609
Okay, I'm all set.

04:24.609 --> 04:27.612
Now remember,
you don't know a thing.

04:27.612 --> 04:28.889
I coulda told you that.

04:30.304 --> 04:33.376
Okay, what do you think?
Do I look successful enough?

04:33.376 --> 04:37.311
Tailor-made suit,
monogrammed shirt,
brand new silk tie.

04:37.311 --> 04:40.072
Is that a tie?
I thought your tongue
was hanging out.

04:43.455 --> 04:44.939
Who asked you?

04:44.939 --> 04:46.872
I was just telling you
what I was thinking.

04:46.872 --> 04:50.635
Look, if I paid you to
think, you could cash your check
at a penny arcade.

04:52.809 --> 04:54.846
Where do you think
I cash it now?

04:56.226 --> 05:00.748
Florence...
I ain't got time,
I got to change.

05:00.748 --> 05:04.269
Weezy, look, this is
the biggest day of my life.
Even bigger than you think.

05:04.269 --> 05:05.822
What do you mean?

05:05.822 --> 05:08.446
Well, today is the day
Lionel's coming into
the business with me.

05:08.446 --> 05:11.241
What? When did he
decide to do that?

05:11.241 --> 05:14.175
In about an hour from now.

05:14.175 --> 05:17.040
Oh, George. How many times
are you gonna ask him?

05:17.040 --> 05:19.180
He always says no.

05:19.180 --> 05:23.633
He ain't gonna say no
this time. Not the way
I got it planned.

05:23.633 --> 05:26.636
Hello, Mr. Jefferson, sir.
I got those papers you wanted.
All 50 of 'em.

05:26.636 --> 05:29.052
Hey, that's great, Ralph.
Come on in.

05:29.052 --> 05:31.089
George, what is all this?

05:31.089 --> 05:34.092
Oh, I sent Ralph out
to get a few copies
of my advertisement.

05:34.092 --> 05:35.749
A few copies?

05:35.749 --> 05:39.684
You got enough there
to paper train King Kong!

05:39.684 --> 05:43.135
It was a pleasure getting
them for you, sir, even
though they are very heavy.

05:43.135 --> 05:44.758
Oh, here, let me help
you out there, Ralph.

05:44.758 --> 05:47.312
Hey, Weezy,
take care of these.

05:51.730 --> 05:53.145
Here, this is
for you, Ralph.

05:53.145 --> 05:55.976
Thank you, sir.
Oh, you're too
generous.

05:55.976 --> 05:57.805
Oh, yeah, you're right.

05:59.704 --> 06:02.292
Anything you say, sir,

06:02.292 --> 06:03.949
any little thing you need,

06:03.949 --> 06:06.055
you just, uh,
let me know.

06:06.055 --> 06:08.609
Would you like to...

06:08.609 --> 06:11.474
Would you like me to
get that spot out of
your pants for you, sir?

06:11.474 --> 06:14.650
What spot? Oh! Weezy,
why didn't you tell me
about that?

06:18.481 --> 06:20.483
George! What
are you doing?

06:20.483 --> 06:22.968
Take these down to my
store and tell 'em I want 'em
back right away!

06:22.968 --> 06:24.729
Yes, sir!
When it comes
to service...

06:26.144 --> 06:28.318
You can't walk
around like that!

06:28.318 --> 06:29.768
We have people coming.

06:29.768 --> 06:31.736
Don't worry, about it,
Weezy, he'll be back
in a minute.

06:35.256 --> 06:36.568
What the hell
you laughing at?

06:36.568 --> 06:38.846
Your legs.

06:38.846 --> 06:40.779
I seen fatter toothpicks!

06:42.402 --> 06:45.784
Now, hold on, Florence.
I happen to like
George's legs.

06:47.234 --> 06:50.202
Besides, where else
would you put knees
like that?

06:51.963 --> 06:53.827
I saw knees
like that once.

06:53.827 --> 06:55.760
On an ostrich.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.244
Are you two
finished?

06:57.244 --> 07:00.109
I got one more.
Your legs...
Shut up!

07:02.732 --> 07:05.770
Oh, Florence,
you look so nice.

07:05.770 --> 07:07.841
Yeah, I do, don't I?

07:07.841 --> 07:11.016
At least you had enough
sense to get dressed up
for my new office opening.

07:11.016 --> 07:14.123
I ain't going to no opening.
It's Saturday.
I'm going to choir rehearsal.

07:14.123 --> 07:16.297
What are you talking
about? Everybody's going to my
opening.

07:16.297 --> 07:19.439
The Lord ain't.
He's meeting me
at choir rehearsal.

07:19.439 --> 07:23.166
Not if he heard you
sing before, he ain't.

07:24.720 --> 07:27.999
See, that Ralph is fast.
Now, see, that's what
I call good service.

07:27.999 --> 07:32.831
Ah, greetings, Mr. J. Let
me be the first to congratulate
you on your new office.

07:32.831 --> 07:35.455
Oh, who are you supposed
to be, Bentley, Fred Astaire?

07:35.455 --> 07:38.388
I was led to believe
the occasion demanded
formal wear,

07:38.388 --> 07:40.770
but I see it's
actually quite sporty.

07:42.703 --> 07:44.567
My pants are down
at the cleaners.

07:44.567 --> 07:47.397
Actually, I haven't
worn this since
the funeral.

07:47.397 --> 07:50.470
Poor Aunt Amelia...
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.817
Oh, don't be.
She lived to
a ripe old age.

07:52.817 --> 07:54.508
Oh, how old was she?

07:54.508 --> 07:57.580
Ah, she'd have been
112 if she were human.

07:59.202 --> 08:01.826
Your aunt wasn't human?

08:01.826 --> 08:03.586
It runs in the family.

08:03.586 --> 08:05.312
Oh, no, it wasn't
Aunt Amelia's funeral.

08:05.312 --> 08:07.556
It was for her poodle, Fifi.

08:07.556 --> 08:10.110
Oh, I've heard about
those pet funerals,

08:10.110 --> 08:12.526
but they always seemed
kinda silly to me.

08:12.526 --> 08:15.149
Oh, not at all, Mrs. J.
It was actually quite
touching.

08:15.149 --> 08:17.807
Fifi was buried
just as she had lived,

08:17.807 --> 08:20.016
with a copy of
the London Times
in her mouth.

08:21.639 --> 08:24.538
Mr. Bentley,
you're the first one here.
Why don't you sit down?

08:24.538 --> 08:28.542
Oh, I can't. I just
popped over to get the
address of the new office.

08:28.542 --> 08:31.580
I have to run
a very important
errand first.

08:31.580 --> 08:34.134
It's in the Brockhurst
Building on East 53rd.

08:34.134 --> 08:36.861
Brockhurst.
I'll try not to be late.

08:37.931 --> 08:39.173
Ta-ta.

08:39.173 --> 08:41.313
Hey! Hey!
Do it, Bentley!

08:43.384 --> 08:45.248
Wonder where the hell
Ralph is with my pants?

08:45.248 --> 08:46.905
He coulda knitted me
a new pair by now.

08:46.905 --> 08:49.908
Well, it's about time.

08:51.185 --> 08:53.671
Hey, Lionel, it's you!
Hey, Pop!

08:53.671 --> 08:56.466
Man you don't have
any pants on!

08:56.466 --> 08:59.159
Didn't I tell you
he was smart, Weezy?

08:59.159 --> 09:02.749
Oh, Mr. Jefferson! Oh...

09:03.577 --> 09:04.923
Ooh, I love your legs.

09:04.923 --> 09:06.338
Ahh!

09:09.549 --> 09:12.690
And they move
real fast, too!

09:12.690 --> 09:17.073
Hey, Mom, there must be
a real good reason why Pop
isn't wearing any pants.

09:17.073 --> 09:19.697
There is.
He gave them to Ralph.

09:19.697 --> 09:23.459
I know your daddy's a
big tipper, but isn't
that overdoing it?

09:23.459 --> 09:26.255
Hey, Weezy, we gotta get
bigger towels in there.

09:26.255 --> 09:29.569
It's about time. Ralph's
gonna get it this time.

09:30.121 --> 09:32.226
Oh, no.

09:32.226 --> 09:33.987
What's the matter,
George?
Lose your bagpipes?

09:35.885 --> 09:37.784
GEORGE:
No wisecracks
from you, Willis.

09:37.784 --> 09:39.095
About what?

09:39.095 --> 09:41.822
I think your towel
looks very nice.

09:41.822 --> 09:44.549
You ought to have cuffs
put on it, though.

09:44.549 --> 09:46.896
Yes, sir.
Ralph, where you been?

09:46.896 --> 09:48.380
I ran all the way, sir.

09:50.417 --> 09:54.317
Louise, the engraver said
that the watch wouldn't
be ready until 3:00.

09:54.317 --> 09:56.734
Oh, no.
And he couldn't get
the band you wanted,

09:56.734 --> 09:59.184
so you'll have to go down
and select another one.
I'm sorry.

09:59.184 --> 10:01.980
Oh, it's okay.
I'll go get it myself.

10:01.980 --> 10:03.533
Well, let the party begin!

10:03.533 --> 10:05.121
Mr. Jefferson...
You still here?

10:05.121 --> 10:08.504
I'm trying to tell you,
sir, your limousine's waiting
downstairs.

10:08.504 --> 10:11.576
Oh, good.
Uh, did they send
everything I asked for?

10:11.576 --> 10:14.821
Ooh, yes, sir.
The limousine's black
and the chauffeur's white.

10:14.821 --> 10:16.374
Okay, good.

10:18.376 --> 10:19.860
Okay!

10:19.860 --> 10:23.484
Let's go, everybody,
we gotta pick Mama
up on the way.

10:23.484 --> 10:27.143
Uh, Florence,
we're leaving now.

10:27.143 --> 10:29.559
All right, Mrs. Jefferson.
Y'all have a nice time.

10:29.559 --> 10:31.976
That'll be easy,
you ain't comin'.
Ha!

10:37.257 --> 10:39.708
Hey! You the driver
of that limousine
out there?

10:39.708 --> 10:42.538
Yeah.
Well,
I'm George Jefferson.

10:42.538 --> 10:45.437
Well, nice to meet ya,
George, but we don't
need any more drivers.

10:47.785 --> 10:50.960
I hired you to drive!

10:50.960 --> 10:53.618
Oh! You're that
George Jefferson!

10:53.618 --> 10:55.137
Yeah, that's right.

10:55.137 --> 10:57.691
I got five people
sittin' out there in
a car that ain't movin'.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.624
Now, if you're the chauffeur,

10:59.624 --> 11:01.695
get out there
and chauff!
Yes, sir!

11:03.283 --> 11:05.043
Hey, hey,
Mr. Jefferson!
Hey.

11:05.043 --> 11:06.942
Saw your ad
in the newspaper.
Oh, yeah?

11:08.495 --> 11:11.947
Boy, you're sure getting
up there in the old chips, eh?
Yeah.

11:11.947 --> 11:14.156
I guess I'm getting
too big to hide it
anymore.

11:15.467 --> 11:17.228
Well, you sure are.
Say, Mr. Jefferson,

11:17.228 --> 11:20.576
I mean, between you
and me, how much you
figure you're worth now?

11:20.576 --> 11:23.717
Well, how much you
think Rockefeller's
worth?

11:23.717 --> 11:25.546
Gee, uh,
I don't know.

11:25.546 --> 11:27.790
You know them
big guys never tell
anybody anything.

11:27.790 --> 11:29.930
Well, what's good enough
for Rockefeller is good
enough for me!

11:29.930 --> 11:31.311
Ha! See you later.

11:33.209 --> 11:35.798
Hey, uh, bartender?
Yes, sir.

11:35.798 --> 11:37.904
About that guy
that just left.
Oh, Mr. Jefferson?

11:37.904 --> 11:41.321
Yeah.
Is he really that loaded?
Gee, is he loaded!

11:41.321 --> 11:44.324
Are you kiddin'? He owns
a chain of cleaning stores.
Take a look at that.

11:44.324 --> 11:46.084
Does he come
in here a lot?

11:46.084 --> 11:49.087
Oh yeah, all the time.
He lives right upstairs.
12-D.

11:50.882 --> 11:52.504
12-D, huh?

11:52.504 --> 11:55.818
Well, that's an awful
lot of money for one
guy to have.

11:55.818 --> 11:56.992
Yeah.

11:58.338 --> 12:00.512
Seems like he ought
a want to share it
a little.

12:02.652 --> 12:04.033
Yeah.

12:13.215 --> 12:16.770
Step right in, folks,
step right in.

12:16.770 --> 12:17.944
Uh...

12:19.324 --> 12:20.912
Did you enjoy
the ride, Mama?

12:20.912 --> 12:22.672
Oh, yes, George.

12:22.672 --> 12:28.437
I only hope that stuck-up
Evelyn Harris saw me
in the limousine.

12:28.437 --> 12:30.163
How could she miss?

12:30.163 --> 12:34.201
You made the chauffeur
drive around the block three
times blowing the horn.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.862
Well how do you like it?

12:39.862 --> 12:41.070
Uh...

12:41.070 --> 12:42.554
I love your
office, George!

12:42.554 --> 12:45.765
It's, uh...
It's so, um, uh...
Compact!

12:45.765 --> 12:47.456
Uh, yes.

12:47.456 --> 12:50.770
I'm sure you'll have a
lot of happy hours here.

12:50.770 --> 12:54.601
Not unless I'm foolin'
around with my secretary, I
won't, 'cause this is her
office!

12:54.601 --> 12:56.706
Now...

12:56.706 --> 12:58.778
This is my office.

13:07.027 --> 13:08.857
GEORGE:
Us big tycoons
like big offices.

13:08.857 --> 13:11.549
Oh, George.

13:11.549 --> 13:14.207
Well, what
about it, Weezy?

13:14.207 --> 13:16.347
Oh, it's...
It's...

13:16.347 --> 13:20.800
What's the word
I'm looking for?
Expensive!

13:20.800 --> 13:24.182
What do you think
of it, Mama?
It's lovely, George.

13:24.182 --> 13:25.943
I'm very proud of you.

13:25.943 --> 13:27.116
Well, you know the
old saying, Mama,

13:27.116 --> 13:30.464
behind every successful
man there stands a good woman.

13:30.464 --> 13:33.191
That's why I'm
so proud of you.

13:33.191 --> 13:35.021
You did it anyway.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.821
Hey! Come on, Weezy.
Let me give you
the guided tour.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.582
See, this is over here...
TOM: George,
this desk is fabulous.

13:44.582 --> 13:46.411
Well, it just oughta be.

13:46.411 --> 13:48.862
It's a genuine
Louis the 19th.

13:49.898 --> 13:52.210
There was no
Louis the 19th.

13:52.210 --> 13:53.625
That's why it's so rare.

13:55.524 --> 13:58.009
Mr. Jefferson, what's
this? A sailfish.

13:58.009 --> 14:01.979
It took me exactly six
hours and 35 minutes of sweat
and pain

14:01.979 --> 14:05.120
to land this beauty
in the Gulf of Mexico.

14:05.120 --> 14:08.399
What? You've never
been fishing in your life.

14:08.399 --> 14:11.954
I know, but for $500,
that's the story I'm telling.

14:13.680 --> 14:17.649
Oh, George, I'm really
impressed with your office.
Who wouldn't be?

14:19.237 --> 14:21.481
Well, how do
I look sitting here?

14:24.933 --> 14:26.382
Like the
King of the Pygmies.

14:32.285 --> 14:35.184
George, there's something
wrong with your desk.

14:35.184 --> 14:38.187
What, Ma?
Well, you've got a
picture of Louise on it

14:38.187 --> 14:40.155
and you have
no picture of me.

14:40.155 --> 14:41.811
Oh, yeah, uh...
I'm getting one
of you, Mama.

14:41.811 --> 14:43.192
Don't you bother.

14:43.192 --> 14:44.676
I brought one.

14:47.887 --> 14:51.476
Oh, hey, that's
real nice, Mama.

14:51.476 --> 14:53.202
It's my favorite one.

14:53.202 --> 14:55.135
I look so young there.

14:56.481 --> 15:00.347
Oh, is this the
one taken during
the Civil War?

15:01.245 --> 15:03.005
Hey, come on,
everybody.

15:03.005 --> 15:06.388
Look, this is
a grand opening here.
We got lots to eat.

15:06.388 --> 15:09.046
Lionel, why don't you
open some champagne.
Okay, Pop.

15:10.426 --> 15:12.083
George Jefferson?
Oh, right here.

15:12.083 --> 15:14.120
Present for ya'.
Oh, thanks.

15:14.120 --> 15:16.432
Ah...

15:16.432 --> 15:18.538
Oh, it's from
Lionel and Jenny

15:18.538 --> 15:20.436
for your new office.

15:20.436 --> 15:23.474
A rubber tree.
A rubber tree?
Hey, that's great!

15:23.474 --> 15:26.304
Thanks, kids,
it's nice.

15:26.304 --> 15:29.307
Ah, ah...
Be careful with
that champagne, Helen.

15:29.307 --> 15:33.380
Remember what happened
the last time you drank it?
You could hardly walk.

15:33.380 --> 15:34.726
That's cause I
had to carry you.

15:37.074 --> 15:39.179
Mama.

15:39.179 --> 15:41.975
Look, if this excitement is
too much for you, you can go
in the other room and rest.

15:41.975 --> 15:44.115
Perhaps you're
right, George.

15:44.115 --> 15:47.912
It's a shame your
father didn't live
to see this day.

15:47.912 --> 15:49.224
Yeah, it sure is.

15:49.224 --> 15:51.502
I think I'll go
drink a toast to him.

15:51.502 --> 15:53.745
Oh, that sounds
great, Mama.

15:53.745 --> 15:57.749
Not that, George,
your father means
more to me than that.

16:07.242 --> 16:09.761
Now,
ladies and gentlemen,

16:09.761 --> 16:12.488
I would like
to propose a...
Just a minute.

16:12.488 --> 16:15.836
I would like to propose
a toast to the man
of the hour,

16:15.836 --> 16:18.253
George Jefferson.

16:22.498 --> 16:25.260
Here's a man who made it
against all the odds.

16:25.260 --> 16:27.365
He didn't graduate
from high school,

16:27.365 --> 16:28.780
he's not overly
intelligent,

16:28.780 --> 16:30.713
he certainly didn't
make it on his looks,

16:30.713 --> 16:33.026
or his charm, or his...
Will you get to the point?

16:33.923 --> 16:35.373
Certainly.

16:36.133 --> 16:37.651
I forgot it.

16:37.651 --> 16:40.068
It don't matter anyway,
'cause I got something
important to say

16:40.068 --> 16:42.277
that's gonna be the
top of the whole party.

16:42.277 --> 16:44.210
Lionel.
Hmm?

16:44.210 --> 16:45.901
What do you think
of this desk?

16:45.901 --> 16:48.800
It's great, Pop.
I'm glad you like it,
because it's yours.

16:49.663 --> 16:51.148
What?

16:51.148 --> 16:53.460
I want you to quit
your job and come into
business with me.

16:53.460 --> 16:55.807
Hey, Pop, I'm an engineer.

16:55.807 --> 16:59.570
So, what? Look, Lionel, you
been sittin' in that same old
cubbyhole for over a year now,

16:59.570 --> 17:02.676
and they ain't gave you
no raise, no promotion,
no nothin'.

17:02.676 --> 17:05.610
But, George, you're the one
who pushed Lionel the hardest

17:05.610 --> 17:07.164
to get his
engineering degree.

17:07.164 --> 17:09.925
Right, that's so the
world know he's educated.

17:09.925 --> 17:11.720
Now show me that
you're smart.

17:13.377 --> 17:14.757
Pop, you know, I...

17:14.757 --> 17:17.691
See that?
He loves the idea
so much he can't talk.

17:17.691 --> 17:19.797
Well, I can talk,
and I hate the idea.

17:19.797 --> 17:22.938
Well, that's too bad.
You out-numbered
two to one. You lose!

17:22.938 --> 17:25.113
Welcome aboard, Lionel.

17:25.113 --> 17:27.391
Pop, not so fast,
I didn't say yes.

17:27.391 --> 17:29.358
And you better not.
Look, you stay out of this.

17:29.358 --> 17:31.498
I'm his wife.
Well, that ain't my fault.

17:35.640 --> 17:36.883
Mr. Jefferson?
That's me.

17:36.883 --> 17:39.817
A rubber tree for you.
What? Who's that from?

17:39.817 --> 17:41.336
It's from us, George.

17:41.336 --> 17:44.684
Oh, Tom, Helen,
you shouldn't have.

17:44.684 --> 17:47.583
Yeah, you're damn right
you shouldn't have,
I already got one.

17:50.241 --> 17:53.244
Maybe you could
mate them, George.

17:53.244 --> 17:55.143
Sure. You could always
use a new set of tires.

17:57.248 --> 18:01.114
Louise, it's almost 3:00!
If you want to get George
his watch, you better go.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.909
Oh, I almost forgot!

18:02.909 --> 18:05.532
Uh, I have to
leave for a while.

18:05.532 --> 18:11.090
And Lionel, don't you
make any fast decisions.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.954
Where you goin', Weezy?
On a little errand.
I'll be right back.

18:13.954 --> 18:18.062
Huh. Hey, Lionel, why
don't you sit down at your desk
and try it on for size.

18:18.062 --> 18:20.340
Oh, now, look, Pop,
I don't have any
experience.

18:20.340 --> 18:21.824
Now, what would I do
in your cleaners?

18:21.824 --> 18:26.691
Oh, about $35,000
a year, for openers.

18:26.691 --> 18:28.624
$35,000?
Uh-huh.

18:28.624 --> 18:30.143
Dollars?
That's right.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.628
Uh...
Uh, Lionel.

18:36.080 --> 18:39.532
Remember, we agreed
we don't care anything
about money.

18:39.532 --> 18:41.810
Oh, sure, Jenny, we did.

18:41.810 --> 18:44.399
$35,000!
Uh-huh.

18:44.399 --> 18:45.848
A year?
Yep.

18:45.848 --> 18:49.197
I hardly make
that in two years.

18:49.197 --> 18:51.130
Uh, Mr. Jefferson,

18:51.130 --> 18:53.753
in case you hadn't
noticed, Lionel's on his own
now.

18:53.753 --> 18:56.963
He's his own man,
he makes his own
decisions,

18:56.963 --> 18:59.483
nobody can tell
him what he can
and cannot do.

18:59.483 --> 19:01.830
Lionel, you're not taking
this job and that's it.

19:03.763 --> 19:06.490
Jenny, aren't you being
a little domineering?

19:06.490 --> 19:09.389
Let Lionel talk.
He has a right to
his own opinion.

19:09.389 --> 19:11.943
That's right, and in
my opinion I feel that...
Shut up, Tom.

19:13.255 --> 19:15.050
Yes, my angel.

19:15.050 --> 19:18.709
Don't be dumb, Lionel.
Look, I'm offering you
top dollar,

19:18.709 --> 19:21.884
executive position,
and all of this.

19:21.884 --> 19:24.163
Pop,
it sure sounds nice,
but I just don't know.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.372
I'll even buy you
your own fish.

19:26.372 --> 19:29.789
Oh, Mr. Jefferson,
did you ever stop
to think that

19:29.789 --> 19:32.171
maybe Lionel might
like his own job?

19:32.171 --> 19:34.173
Well, a man can
like a lot of jobs.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.797
Oh, the only reason you're
even considering this is
because of the money.

19:37.797 --> 19:40.593
You're being bought
for 30,000 lousy dollars!

19:40.593 --> 19:42.284
You know I resent
that, Jenny!

19:42.284 --> 19:44.804
And it's $35,000.

19:44.804 --> 19:47.565
Well, I wouldn't
care if it was 50.
I would!

19:47.565 --> 19:48.877
Who said anything
about 50?

19:49.878 --> 19:52.087
Look out, everybody,
comin' through.

19:52.087 --> 19:56.229
Oh, what is this?
Don't anybody send
candy anymore?

19:56.229 --> 19:57.989
Hey, this place
looks like dog heaven.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.098
Now, what am I going
to do with this plant?

20:03.098 --> 20:05.480
It's from Mr. Billings,
the vice-president of
your bank.

20:05.480 --> 20:09.000
If he wanted to send
something green, he
should've sent some money.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.865
Hey, you two, this is
nothing to fight about.

20:11.865 --> 20:13.660
I think it's a
lot to fight about!

20:14.558 --> 20:16.422
Not now, of course.

20:16.422 --> 20:19.942
Instead of arguing,
why don't you just
sit down and discuss it?

20:19.942 --> 20:21.806
Now what do you say?
Hmm?

20:23.463 --> 20:26.259
I'm sorry, Lionel.

20:26.259 --> 20:29.607
Me, too, Jenny.
What are you apologizing for,
Lionel, you were right.

20:29.607 --> 20:31.299
George,
no one's right,
no one's wrong.

20:31.299 --> 20:34.025
Everything's not
black or white.
It is in your family!

20:38.167 --> 20:40.860
Oh, here you are.
I'm sorry I'm late,
Mr. J.,

20:40.860 --> 20:43.552
but I had to pick up
your office-warming
present.

20:43.552 --> 20:44.898
It better not be
what I think it is!

20:44.898 --> 20:46.693
It's a book.
Oh, good.

20:46.693 --> 20:49.524
On how to take care
of this rubber tree
plant.

20:52.872 --> 20:56.600
Oh, what a lucky guess.
I didn't know you
collected rubber trees.

20:57.635 --> 20:59.119
I don't collect 'em.

20:59.119 --> 21:00.880
Look at the bright side,
George.

21:00.880 --> 21:05.298
Now you won't have to hire
a secretary. All you need
is a gardener.

21:05.298 --> 21:08.577
There, there, Penelope.
You play with your friends.

21:08.577 --> 21:12.236
Mr. J.! Your office
is simply smashing.
Oh, you like it, huh, Bent?

21:12.236 --> 21:15.101
Oh, goodness, yes.
It's functional and
efficient,

21:15.101 --> 21:17.862
and yet it has that
certain je ne sais quoi.

21:17.862 --> 21:21.763
Uh, not any more.
I just had the exterminator
in there yesterday.

21:21.763 --> 21:24.593
Success, Mr. J.,
and many prosperous years.

21:24.593 --> 21:28.804
Ah, thank you, Bentley.
Grab yourself a glass,
I'll buy you a drink.

21:28.804 --> 21:30.116
Hey, Lionel.
What?

21:30.116 --> 21:33.326
Don't you think we
ought a let Bentley
in on the good news?

21:33.326 --> 21:36.467
This is the
biggest day of my life,
Bentley.

21:36.467 --> 21:39.332
My son Lionel is joining
me in the business.

21:39.332 --> 21:40.678
Oh, that's marvelous.

21:40.678 --> 21:42.439
Now, now, hold on, Pop.

21:42.439 --> 21:45.511
Now, I didn't say that.
Jenny and I have to
talk it over.

21:45.511 --> 21:49.135
Ah, well, you never got
that close to saying yes before,
it's good enough for me.

21:49.135 --> 21:52.103
Hey! My first
phone call! Where's the phone?

21:54.174 --> 21:56.832
It sounds like it's
coming from the cigar box.

21:56.832 --> 21:59.939
Oh, hey.
See, that's class.

22:02.010 --> 22:03.563
"Jefferson and Son."

22:04.253 --> 22:05.324
That's him speaking.

22:06.463 --> 22:08.050
Say when...
What?

22:08.050 --> 22:10.536
When.
Who is this?

22:10.536 --> 22:12.400
When.
When!
Pop!

22:12.400 --> 22:14.125
Hey, is this
some kind of joke?

22:15.851 --> 22:17.577
Yeah, uh, yeah,
I'm listening.

22:18.406 --> 22:19.476
Yeah.

22:19.959 --> 22:21.374
Yeah.

22:21.374 --> 22:22.789
What?

22:22.789 --> 22:24.135
Well, where am I gonna get...

22:25.758 --> 22:27.104
Hey, hey, wait a minute!

22:28.277 --> 22:29.348
Hello?

22:30.521 --> 22:31.695
Hello?

22:35.526 --> 22:37.356
Hey, what's the matter, Pop?

22:37.356 --> 22:38.840
What was that all about?

22:39.634 --> 22:40.876
Weezy, uh...

22:42.084 --> 22:43.431
Weezy's been kidnapped.

23:11.217 --> 23:15.186
LOUISE: The Jeffersons
was videotaped in front
of a studio audience.

23:26.439 --> 23:28.199
Movin',
movin' on up
