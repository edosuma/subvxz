00:02.000 --> 00:05.133
No! There's no other
horse, I swear!

00:05.133 --> 00:07.467
Then why do you keep
leaving me, Mile?

00:07.467 --> 00:08.800
Don't leave me.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.500
[gasps]

00:10.500 --> 00:13.300
- Dad, I need a favor.
- You want Blue Jeans
out here, don't you?

00:13.300 --> 00:15.800
All right, if I'm old enough
to go to college,

00:15.800 --> 00:19.233
and I'm old enough to vote,
then I'm old enough
to get my own place.

00:19.233 --> 00:21.200
Now this isn't Tennessee.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.934
You can't just
walk across the yard

00:22.934 --> 00:24.567
to my window
when you miss me.

00:24.567 --> 00:28.734
- What happened?
- Blue Jeans. He ran away.

00:28.734 --> 00:31.467
[loud rock music plays,

00:36.500 --> 00:38.000
You own this place?!

00:38.000 --> 00:39.600
I own the whole block.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.200
I thought when
I brought you out here

00:41.200 --> 00:43.200
this was the end
of these little
late-night "chitchats."

00:43.200 --> 00:45.000
D-D-Dangflabbit, Miley!

00:45.000 --> 00:47.934
I never wanted you
to bring me out here
in the first place.

00:47.934 --> 00:51.367
What I meant was I needed you
to come back home to Tennessee.

00:51.367 --> 00:53.934
I'm going to the market.
You got any special
requests?

00:53.934 --> 00:57.767
Just one: I want to
move back to Tennessee.

Is it because you're
worried about Blue Jeans?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.100
Yeah, but it's not just that.

02:00.100 --> 02:01.900
I mean, I brought
Blue Jeans out here

02:01.900 --> 02:03.300
'cause I thought
he was missing me,

02:03.300 --> 02:06.600
but last night I realized it was
really me missing Tennessee.

02:06.600 --> 02:10.600
Let me guess:
your talking horse
told you this?

02:12.033 --> 02:15.100
Dad! I am not gonna make
this important of a decision

02:15.100 --> 02:17.033
because a talking horse
told me to.

02:18.133 --> 02:20.033
I argued with him
until he turned into me,

02:20.033 --> 02:22.400
and, as you and I both know,
it's useless to argue with me.

02:23.734 --> 02:25.100
I hear that.

02:25.867 --> 02:27.233
Dad, look...

02:27.233 --> 02:29.500
It may seem like I'm not
thinking straight,

02:29.500 --> 02:31.500
and maybe I'm not, but...

02:31.500 --> 02:34.300
...I can't shake this feeling
of wanting to go back home.

02:34.300 --> 02:36.867
Something that you're missing
back home in Tennessee?

02:36.867 --> 02:40.300
- So you're not mad?
- No, of course not.

02:40.300 --> 02:43.667
I mean, this is a really
important decision

02:43.667 --> 02:46.100
and we don't need to rush it.

02:46.100 --> 02:50.367
We need to take a step back
and give this the consideration
that it deserves.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.800
We're going back
to Tennessee.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.300
And leave Lilly?
How can you be so cold?

02:58.300 --> 02:59.834
We'll take her with us.

02:59.834 --> 03:02.200
Dad, Lilly's not gonna
want to come with us.

03:02.200 --> 03:05.967
California is her home,
and besides, Oliver
and her dad are here.

03:05.967 --> 03:07.700
Think a little.

03:08.834 --> 03:11.767
OK, I am thinking,
and what I'm thinking is

03:11.767 --> 03:15.200
my dad always told me when
a female is having a problem

03:15.200 --> 03:17.300
and tries to drag you
into the middle of it,

03:17.300 --> 03:21.300
the best thing you can do is
smile, nod and compliment her.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.700
Dad, it's not that simple.

03:23.700 --> 03:26.367
I mean, sure,
Oliver will be OK,

03:26.367 --> 03:28.734
but, I mean,
what about Lilly?
She just moved in.

03:28.734 --> 03:30.867
How can I abandon
my best friend like this?

03:30.867 --> 03:35.400
Oh, my goodness, you look
lovely this morning!

03:35.400 --> 03:37.000
It's not gonna work.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.100
Did you do something
different to your hair?

03:40.300 --> 03:42.667
- Oh, good, you're up.
- Oh, good, you're here.

03:42.667 --> 03:44.700
Listen, I gotta go
to the store.

03:44.700 --> 03:47.233
Compliment her and
stay close to the exit.

03:47.233 --> 03:48.600
Good luck.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.867
Hey. Nice pajamas.

03:54.900 --> 03:57.200
OK, where's Lilly?
She's still sleeping?

03:57.200 --> 04:00.200
Yep. Poor kid.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.600
Sailing away
on the ship of dreams.

04:02.600 --> 04:05.834
Little does she know that
I'm about to wake her up

04:05.834 --> 04:09.834
and crush that ship into
the brutal rocks of reality.

04:11.133 --> 04:12.934
- OK.
- [door opens]

04:14.467 --> 04:17.467
- Say her manicure looks nice.
- Your manicure looks nice.

04:17.467 --> 04:19.800
- Stop that!
- OK, fine.
Your tips are chipped

04:19.800 --> 04:21.667
and your pajamas,
a little bit frumpy.

04:22.967 --> 04:24.934
Can we talk about me
for a minute?

04:24.934 --> 04:27.400
The most exciting thing
happened last night.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.800
So I was over at Jackson's,

04:28.800 --> 04:30.500
and there's this band
that lives upstairs...

04:32.734 --> 04:36.200
All right. All right,
this is gonna have
to work for now.

04:36.200 --> 04:39.667
- [knock on door]
- Oh, no!

04:44.233 --> 04:46.133
Dude, your door's busted.

04:46.133 --> 04:47.767
Dude, I know.

04:49.834 --> 04:51.800
Hey, look, um...

04:51.800 --> 04:53.100
We're rehearsing upstairs,

04:53.100 --> 04:54.967
and all this banging
going on down here

04:54.967 --> 04:56.233
is kinda harshing the vibe.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.834
You're Trent Stone
from Tepid Funk!

05:00.834 --> 05:03.233
Wait, wait... Who cares?

05:03.233 --> 05:06.000
- You're Oliver Oken
from <i>America's Top Talent! </i>
- Yeah.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.567
You're the best thing
that happened to music
since the air guitar, dude!

05:08.567 --> 05:11.567
[mimics guitar riffs]

05:11.567 --> 05:14.133
- Dude, you know what would
be the coolest thing ever?
- Huh?

05:14.867 --> 05:16.133
If you opened for us.

05:16.133 --> 05:19.967
- Uh, well...
- Please?

05:22.133 --> 05:24.600
- OK.
- Yay! Yay!

05:24.600 --> 05:26.700
Yay! Thank you!

05:28.734 --> 05:33.200
Really? "Yay, yay,
yay, yay, yay"?

05:33.200 --> 05:37.000
OK, it didn't happen
exactly like that,

05:37.000 --> 05:40.667
but they did ask me to open
for them on their world tour.

05:40.667 --> 05:42.667
- World tour?
- Yeah.

05:42.667 --> 05:45.700
How much of the world
are we talking about?

05:45.700 --> 05:47.133
Six months.

05:47.133 --> 05:51.300
Six months?! You're gonna
leave Lilly for six months?

05:51.300 --> 05:54.367
I know. That's why I'm so happy
she has you to lean on.

05:54.367 --> 05:56.934
- [sighs]
- Think about it.
I mean, her mom's moved,

05:56.934 --> 05:58.967
her dad's an hour away.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.767
Without me,
you're all she's got.

06:00.767 --> 06:03.200
You know, you're it.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.400
You're the center
of her universe, all right?

06:06.400 --> 06:08.934
- All the roads lead back...
- I'm moving back to Tennessee.

that both of us are leaving?

06:26.600 --> 06:28.233

sensitivity that makes you

06:30.233 --> 06:31.834
the perfect person
to tell Lilly.

06:31.834 --> 06:33.300
Tell me what?

Memories that will carry you
through the hard times life
inevitably throws at you?

Would you both stop
smiling at me like that?

'Cause it's kind of
creeping me out.

- No problem.

What did I just say?

07:09.700 --> 07:11.667
- Sorry.
- Sorry. My bad.

their pictures in the car.

I'd be OK with the little
ones from the machine.

Oh, you silly Lilly!

08:46.367 --> 08:47.934
Everybody loses those.

These jumbo puppies
are here to stay.

So cute!

08:52.400 --> 08:55.100
OK, you keep saying
everything's OK
and I go along with it

for a matching purse, but, uh...

every five minutes

and wearing the friendship
bracelet I gave you
three years ago? What gives?

09:06.567 --> 09:09.867
All right, fine.
There's no easy way
to say this.

09:15.800 --> 09:18.133
I'm moving back to Tennessee.

09:18.133 --> 09:20.967
And I'm going on tour
with Tepid Funk.

09:24.033 --> 09:26.300
Lilly, leaving you
is the hardest thing
that I've ever had to do

09:26.300 --> 09:28.834
but there's just something
pulling me back to Tennessee.

09:28.834 --> 09:31.900
This is an unbelievable
opportunity for me.

09:34.900 --> 09:37.767
- Wow.
- Do you want a tissue?

09:37.767 --> 09:39.767
Do you want to hit something?

09:39.767 --> 09:41.233
Maybe Oliver?

- No, I understand.
- Aaah!

09:57.734 --> 09:59.200
Wait, you do?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.800
Yeah, Oliver,
you're right.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.867
I mean, you can't pass up
something like this

10:04.867 --> 10:07.300
and I wouldn't want you to.

10:07.300 --> 10:10.033
I'm so proud of you.

10:10.033 --> 10:12.133
And, Miley,
I totally get it.

10:12.133 --> 10:14.734
If your heart is telling you
you have to go back
to Tennessee,

10:14.734 --> 10:16.400
then you have to.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.934
So you're not mad at me?

10:19.033 --> 10:21.000
No, of course not.

I mean, I'm gonna miss
both of you guys like crazy,

10:27.100 --> 10:28.867
Lilly, you are amazing.

10:28.867 --> 10:30.567

that you'd freak out

thinking I was
one of those guys
who goes on the road

10:32.834 --> 10:34.834
promising not to cheat,
but then, you know,

10:34.834 --> 10:37.200
caves after the first
cute girl who, uh...

10:38.700 --> 10:40.734
Well, let's be honest,
after the first cute girl.

10:43.200 --> 10:47.300
And I was terrified
that you'd think I was
gonna go back to Tennessee,

10:47.300 --> 10:49.667
hang out with my old friends,
get a new phone,

your number in it,

10:51.133 --> 10:54.300
and then you try to call me
all lonely and sad

10:54.300 --> 10:57.033
and all you hear is a voice
saying, "Oh, I'm sorry,

10:57.033 --> 10:58.867
but this number
has been disconnected,

10:58.867 --> 11:00.900
because she now has
cooler friends."

11:02.467 --> 11:04.100
- [panting]
- Lilly?

11:04.100 --> 11:05.800
Lilly-pop, are you OK?

11:05.800 --> 11:08.600
I was, until you guys
verbalized stuff you
thought I'd worry about

11:08.600 --> 11:10.900
that I wasn't worried about
because I am!

11:10.900 --> 11:14.400
Oh, no. Lilly,
please don't cry.

11:15.700 --> 11:17.300
OK, you know what,
Lilly? I won't go.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.100
I'll give up
my dreams for you.

11:20.100 --> 11:23.600
Oh, what, you can stay
and grow to hate me?

11:23.600 --> 11:26.000
Oh, yeah, that's
a much better choice.

11:27.233 --> 11:28.800
OK, fine, then I'll stay.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.567
Oh, so you're so bitter
you can't even look at me

11:31.567 --> 11:33.400
without seeing
the soul-sucking leech

11:33.400 --> 11:36.100
who kept you from
following your heart?

11:36.100 --> 11:38.500
Why does saying goodbye
have to hurt so much?

11:38.500 --> 11:42.133
I know. Why can't
we be more like them?

11:43.700 --> 11:46.367
[all sobbing]

11:47.500 --> 11:49.834
[Lilly] I think
I need that tissue now.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.800
[loudly blows nose]

12:02.867 --> 12:05.800
[sobbing]

12:05.800 --> 12:07.500
How much time
do we have left?

12:07.500 --> 12:10.467
Well, we just have
to wait for my dad

12:10.467 --> 12:12.800
to find a ranch
in Tennessee, but...

12:12.800 --> 12:16.100
- [sobs] ...let's not
think about that right now.
- OK.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.667
Whoo! Great,
you're still here.

12:18.667 --> 12:21.400
I just found
the perfect ranch.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.967
You're gonna love it.

12:22.967 --> 12:25.100
Thanks a lot, Dad!

12:25.100 --> 12:28.667
Yeah! I'm so happy
for you. Bon voyage!

12:33.867 --> 12:36.367
[scoffs] Girls.

12:37.700 --> 12:39.467
They are so emotional.

12:40.667 --> 12:43.834

12:49.834 --> 12:51.900

12:53.800 --> 12:56.600
Good cabinet. Stay.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.000
Stay.

13:00.700 --> 13:02.133
All right.

13:02.133 --> 13:05.100
Jackson Stewart,
handyman.

13:09.934 --> 13:13.200
Stop mocking me!

13:13.200 --> 13:14.834

13:14.834 --> 13:19.567
Miley! Hey!
Come on in... you!

13:19.567 --> 13:22.967
Welcome to paradise,
population: <i>moi. </i>

13:23.934 --> 13:25.367
You'll have
to forgive the mess.

13:25.367 --> 13:26.934
I'm just doing
a little remodeling

13:26.934 --> 13:29.467
because I just love
this place so much.

13:30.967 --> 13:32.900
You like my table?

13:32.900 --> 13:35.667
It's a table,
and a place to stand

13:35.667 --> 13:37.967
if I ever have
a regular-size date.

13:37.967 --> 13:42.300
Which I will, because
my apartment is awesome!

13:42.300 --> 13:45.600
Jackson, I have a problem
and I need to talk to somebody.

13:45.600 --> 13:50.200
Because, like, the six billion
people you'd come to before me

13:50.200 --> 13:53.133
have just sort of
mysteriously vanished?

13:53.133 --> 13:54.400
Oh, wait, no.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.467
I see about a half dozen
of 'em out there right now.

13:56.467 --> 13:59.467
Huh? There's a guy talking
to pigeons across the street,

13:59.467 --> 14:02.033
seems like he really enjoys
a nice conversation.

14:02.033 --> 14:03.900
Jackson, I'm serious.

14:03.900 --> 14:06.100
I told Dad that I want
to move back to Tennessee

14:06.100 --> 14:08.900
and, before I could even
blink, he found a place.

14:08.900 --> 14:11.900
Wait. Um,
we're moving back home?

14:11.900 --> 14:13.400
Well, Dad and I are,

14:13.400 --> 14:15.667
but you seem to like
this apartment so much

14:15.667 --> 14:16.867
I wouldn't expect you
to come.

14:16.867 --> 14:18.567
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I mean, yes.

14:18.567 --> 14:21.500
Yes, I love this apartment.
I love it!

14:21.500 --> 14:25.500
Uh, but not more than
the family unit, you know?

14:25.500 --> 14:27.600
I would insist that Dad
pay off the lease

14:27.600 --> 14:31.233
so that way the family unit
could remain unified and united,

14:31.233 --> 14:35.133
and, you know... in a unit.

14:35.133 --> 14:38.367
- You hate it here,
don't you?
- It's a nightmare!

14:38.367 --> 14:40.200
It's... [sobs]

14:40.200 --> 14:43.100
Look, if we move back
to Tennessee

14:43.100 --> 14:44.600
then I won't have
to admit to Dad

14:44.600 --> 14:47.200
that my first decision
as an adult was, uh...

14:49.000 --> 14:51.700
[groans]
...a complete disaster.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.567
How did this
become such a mess?

14:55.567 --> 14:56.734
I don't know.

14:56.734 --> 14:58.200
An incompetent
furniture maker

14:58.200 --> 15:00.600
with no pride
in his workmanship.

15:00.600 --> 15:03.300
Jackson, I was
talking about my life.

15:04.700 --> 15:07.300
I mean, part of me wants
to go back to Tennessee

15:07.300 --> 15:11.600
and... part of me
loves it here.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.767
And how can I leave Lilly?

15:15.767 --> 15:17.400
[sighs] What do I do?

15:17.400 --> 15:20.200
I love you, but
I don't have your answers.

15:21.734 --> 15:24.300
Wait, I think I might know
something that will help.

15:24.300 --> 15:26.300
I'm not talking
to the pigeon guy.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.133
No, I'm talking about
Blue Jeans.

15:28.133 --> 15:29.500
You should go for a ride.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.867
That always seems like when
you do your best thinking.

15:31.867 --> 15:33.400
Yeah, you're right.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.000
Wow.

15:36.500 --> 15:40.400
Such simple words, yet
they taste like vomit.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.300
Uh, "Thank you, Jackson"
would be enough.

15:43.300 --> 15:44.300
Thank you, Jackson.

15:46.667 --> 15:49.300

but still gonna need a mint.

16:14.834 --> 16:17.133
Hey, I have a lucky bracelet
just like that!

16:17.133 --> 16:18.967

about leaving my life here.

Especially Lilly.

17:35.467 --> 17:39.033
Yeah. I mean, how can
going back to Tennessee
be the right decision

17:39.033 --> 17:42.700
if it makes me and the people
that I love so unhappy?

17:44.000 --> 17:45.600
Daddy...

17:46.934 --> 17:49.800
- ...I don't think I can do it.
- I know that, darling.

17:49.800 --> 17:51.800
I could tell by the way
you were acting this morning.

17:51.800 --> 17:54.133
Then why'd you go off and
buy a ranch in Tennessee?

17:54.133 --> 17:56.100
- I didn't.
- What?

17:56.100 --> 17:59.800
I could tell you needed
to be in Tennessee
and California both,

17:59.800 --> 18:02.300
so I found a way we could
meet in the middle.

18:02.300 --> 18:05.400
- You bought a ranch
in Oklahoma?
- [laughs] No.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.300
Actually, it's a little
closer than that.

18:07.300 --> 18:09.500
Twenty acres,
cute little barn,

18:09.500 --> 18:11.800
kinda like
a Crowley Corners
down by the sea.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.800
- You did not!
- See that place
right over there?

18:16.967 --> 18:18.467
You bought that place?

18:18.467 --> 18:21.000
It's not Tennessee, but
it's pretty daggone close.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.100
It's better!
It's perfect.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.934
There's room
for everybody:

18:28.700 --> 18:31.233

18:32.200 --> 18:34.200
I'll fill you in
on that later.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.900
Thank you so much, Daddy.

18:35.900 --> 18:38.000
- I love you, Mile.
- I love you, too.

18:53.600 --> 18:57.300
Wow. Seeing it all empty
is kinda sad.

18:57.300 --> 19:02.600
I know. I'm just glad
you and Miley are still
gonna be living together.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.300
It'll be a lot easier
being on tour knowing
that you have her.

19:05.300 --> 19:07.100
You better call me
every day.

19:07.100 --> 19:09.800
- I'm gonna call you
twice a day.
- [sighs]

19:09.800 --> 19:13.033
Yeah, but can you make sure
it's not too early
and not too late?

19:13.033 --> 19:16.200
All right, fine, call whenever,
but I want to talk to you, too.

19:18.600 --> 19:22.100
Yeah, but seriously,
I'm much nicer between
10:00 and 10:00.

Yeah, what is he doing
up there?

19:27.834 --> 19:29.834
I don't know. He's packing
up some valuables

19:29.834 --> 19:31.200

to hand-carry.

19:32.934 --> 19:34.200

Andrea Strand Tasered me.

a great apartment now.

ten miles up the road.
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

swimming pool

20:35.600 --> 20:37.700

of the house you're on

you got him out of his lease

to fix up,

a ranch that needs
some dressing.
