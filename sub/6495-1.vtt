02:47.592 --> 02:49.457
<i>The summer I was</i>
<i>8 years old,</i>

02:49.594 --> 02:52.620
<i>5 hours disappeared</i>
<i>from my life.</i>

02:52.764 --> 02:54.197
<i>5 hours.</i>

02:54.332 --> 02:55.594
<i>Lost.</i>

02:55.734 --> 02:57.531
<i>Gone without a trace.</i>

03:05.644 --> 03:07.509
<i>Last thing I remember I was</i>
<i>sitting on the bench...</i>

03:07.646 --> 03:08.977
<i>at my Little League game.</i>

03:11.316 --> 03:13.216
<i>It started to rain.</i>

03:13.351 --> 03:16.184
<i>What happened after that</i>
<i>remains a pitch black void.</i>

03:17.455 --> 03:18.012
<i>Brian?</i>

03:18.623 --> 03:19.351
<i>Brian?</i>

03:22.227 --> 03:22.852
You, dork.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.586
What the heck are
you doing in there?

03:26.464 --> 03:27.988
Hey.

03:28.133 --> 03:29.760
You're bleeding.

03:39.311 --> 03:41.506
Whew! It is
terrible out there.

03:41.646 --> 03:42.704
Mom!

03:42.847 --> 03:45.338
Hello, sweetheart.
What happened to you?

03:45.483 --> 03:47.974
Brian got a bloody nose
hiding in the cellar.

03:48.119 --> 03:50.417
Whatever on Earth were
you doing down there?

03:50.555 --> 03:54.184
Are you okay, sweetheart?
You poor little baby.

03:54.326 --> 03:57.625
They had me cooped up all
night in that awful mail room.

03:57.762 --> 04:00.663
I didn't even know it was
raining till I got off work.

04:00.799 --> 04:02.061
Hold still.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.030
Ow.

04:03.168 --> 04:05.159
Did one of the other moms
give you a ride home?

04:05.337 --> 04:08.829
- I'm going to bed.
<i>- I hope you're happy.</i>

04:09.007 --> 04:11.840
I knew he'd get hurt playing
sports out there in the field.

04:11.977 --> 04:15.469
You know, when I was a kid, I wasn't
exactly a star player either.

04:15.614 --> 04:18.378
But at least I gave it my all,
I wasn't a quitter.

04:19.284 --> 04:20.774
Sorry, Dad.

04:22.787 --> 04:26.314
- Good night.
- Good night.

04:26.458 --> 04:28.756
I told your father that
Little League thing <i>...</i>

04:28.893 --> 04:30.986
was a stupid idea.

04:31.129 --> 04:32.323
Hold your nose.

04:36.835 --> 04:39.497
<i>Mom made me quit baseball</i>
<i>the very next day.</i>

04:58.056 --> 05:00.354
<i>This was when</i>
<i>the nightmares began...</i>

05:00.492 --> 05:02.790
<i>...and the nose bleeds.</i>

05:02.927 --> 05:05.623
<i>I wet the bed several times...</i>

05:05.764 --> 05:08.358
<i>...and then there</i>
<i>were the black outs.</i>

05:09.868 --> 05:12.234
<i>I'd feel my eyes</i>
<i>roll back in my head.</i>

05:12.404 --> 05:15.339
<i>I'd crumple to the floor</i>
<i>like a dropped puppet.</i>

05:21.313 --> 05:23.577
The darn thing's not
even a year old yet.

05:23.715 --> 05:26.707
Maybe it's screwed up from
all the lighting last week.

05:27.385 --> 05:29.649
<i>Oh, your father's going to be</i>
<i>overjoyed about this.</i>

05:29.788 --> 05:31.551
<i>What time's Dad getting home?</i>

05:31.690 --> 05:33.681
<i>Not for another hour,</i>
<i>at least, honey.</i>

05:35.994 --> 05:38.554
Mom. Deborah.
Come look!

05:42.400 --> 05:43.662
It's a UFO!

05:43.802 --> 05:46.862
Oh please, it's just a
weather balloon or something.

05:47.038 --> 05:49.871
No, look what it's doing to the TV.

05:52.344 --> 05:54.437
It's flying over the house!

05:54.579 --> 05:56.012
Let's go up on the roof.

05:56.181 --> 05:59.582
No, wait!
Children, be careful!

06:03.722 --> 06:07.852
<i>That summer, those were the</i>
<i>two things I'd never forget.</i>

06:07.992 --> 06:11.189
<i>The cramped, stale</i>
<i>darkness of the crawlspace.</i>

06:11.329 --> 06:15.459
<i>And, equal in power</i>
<i>and mystery... that UFO,</i>

06:15.600 --> 06:19.832
<i>out there somewhere travelling</i>
<i>across the universe.</i>

06:24.109 --> 06:27.909
<i>The summer I was 8 years old,</i>
<i>I came for the first time.</i>

06:28.046 --> 06:30.537
<i>I was watching my Mom going at it</i>
<i>with her boyfriend of the moment,</i>

06:30.682 --> 06:32.877
<i>Alfred, in my old swing set.</i>

06:35.920 --> 06:41.153
<i>Alfred was all Marlboro man,</i>
<i>dumb as a fucking rock.</i>

06:41.292 --> 06:43.920
<i>What I would, years later,</i>
<i>come to call "my type".</i>

06:47.332 --> 06:48.890
<i>And only the most boring,</i>
<i>stupid things...</i>

06:49.033 --> 06:50.398
<i>have ever come out of his mouth.</i>

06:50.535 --> 06:53.698
<i>But seeing him like this,</i>
<i>whimpering and grunting...</i>

06:53.872 --> 06:57.808
<i>like a helpless animal, I</i>
<i>couldn't take my eyes off of him.</i>

07:14.626 --> 07:17.186
<i>I'd been masturbating for</i>
<i>years, but it wasn't till...</i>

07:17.328 --> 07:21.458
<i>that summer that jizz actually</i>
<i>squirted out my dick when I came.</i>

07:21.599 --> 07:23.226
<i>Couldn't wait to show Coach.</i>

07:23.868 --> 07:25.631
<i>Oh, maybe I should start</i>
<i>at the beginning.</i>

07:25.804 --> 07:28.238
<i>Back in June, my Mom signed</i>
<i>me up for Little League.</i>

07:28.406 --> 07:30.636
<i>It was Alfred's idea, a way</i>
<i>for them to fuck freely,</i>

07:30.775 --> 07:32.675
<i>without the expense</i>
<i>of a sitter.</i>

07:33.645 --> 07:34.612
Are you excited?

07:36.581 --> 07:38.105
Coach Heider?

07:42.587 --> 07:45.112
<i>Desire sledgehammered me.</i>

07:45.256 --> 07:47.554
<i>He looked like the lifeguards,</i>
<i>cowboys and firemen,</i>

07:47.692 --> 07:51.355
<i>I'd seen in the Playgirls that my</i>
<i>mom kept stashed under her bed.</i>

07:51.496 --> 07:53.657
<i>Back then, I didn't know</i>
<i>what to do with my feelings.</i>

07:53.798 --> 07:57.791
<i>They were like, a gift I had</i>
<i>to open in front of a crowd.</i>

07:57.936 --> 07:59.267
- Hello.
- Hello.

07:59.437 --> 08:02.304
I'm Ellen McCormick.
And this is my son, Neil.

08:03.641 --> 08:04.471
Hello, Neil.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.044
Honey, don't you want to
say hello to your new coach?

08:09.714 --> 08:13.707
Don't worry, it takes him a
while to warm up to strangers.

08:16.354 --> 08:18.447
<i>I quickly became the</i>
<i>team's star player.</i>

08:20.425 --> 08:21.983
<i>Which wasn't saying much</i>
<i>considering the other kids...</i>

08:22.126 --> 08:24.321
<i>were a bunch of</i>
<i>hopeless spazzes.</i>

08:24.462 --> 08:26.862
<i>Our first game,</i>
<i>bottom of the eighth,</i>

08:26.998 --> 08:29.193
<i>I whacked a triple</i>
<i>with the bases loaded.</i>

08:29.334 --> 08:32.201
<i>The crowd went fuckin' nuts.</i>

08:32.370 --> 08:34.235
<i>But I didn't care about that.</i>

08:34.371 --> 08:37.239
<i>All that mattered was</i>
<i>it made Coach proud.</i>

08:38.643 --> 08:40.873
<i>After that first victory,</i>
<i>the coach called my Mom...</i>

08:41.011 --> 08:43.845
<i>to tell her he was taking the team</i>
<i>out to a movie to celebrate.</i>

08:48.720 --> 08:50.312
Hey, big guy,
ready to go?

08:51.489 --> 08:52.854
- Coach?
- Yeah.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.788
Where's everybody else?

08:54.926 --> 08:57.656
Well, it looks like it's just going
to be you and me today, bud.

08:57.795 --> 09:00.855
- Really?
- Yup.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.398
Cool.

09:03.868 --> 09:06.462
<i>I picked "Blood Prom," an</i>
<i>R-rated slasher flick...</i>

09:06.638 --> 09:08.731
<i>with tons of cool gore</i>
<i>and murders in it.</i>

09:08.907 --> 09:10.499
<i>When this one really</i>
<i>annoying blonde chick...</i>

09:10.675 --> 09:12.370
<i>got her head chopped off,</i>
<i>I cheered.</i>

09:13.578 --> 09:14.943
<i>After the movie,</i>
<i>we picked up a pizza...</i>

09:15.079 --> 09:16.307
<i>and headed back to Coach's.</i>

09:18.016 --> 09:20.075
<i>Coach's house was awesome.</i>

09:20.218 --> 09:24.951
<i>He had a giant TV, an Atari with</i>
<i>Donkey Kong, Asteroids, Frogger.</i>

09:25.089 --> 09:26.420
<i>All my favourite games.</i>

09:31.863 --> 09:34.525
Hah. You exploded.
My turn.

09:37.235 --> 09:38.702
Sure your mom's
not expecting you?

09:38.870 --> 09:40.132
No.
She works.

09:40.305 --> 09:42.899
She's probably got a date
with Alfred afterward.

09:43.074 --> 09:46.407
My guess is you spend a lot
of time by yourself, huh?

09:46.544 --> 09:48.136
Yeah.
But I kind of like it.

09:48.279 --> 09:50.406
I just ride my
bike and watch TV.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.515
It's cool.

09:54.285 --> 09:56.480
Oh shit!
You made me mess up!

09:57.956 --> 09:59.617
Sorry.

09:59.757 --> 10:00.849
Hold on.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.620
Come here for a sec.

10:05.763 --> 10:08.061
Bring one of those
bottles of Peach Nehi.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.206
Now, this might seem a
little weird at first.

10:16.374 --> 10:18.865
But I need to record
my team's voices,

10:19.043 --> 10:21.739
especially my best players.

10:21.879 --> 10:23.244
Okay?

10:23.381 --> 10:24.541
Take this.

10:28.052 --> 10:32.079
Now just speak into it
using your normal voice.

10:32.223 --> 10:33.986
Well, what should I say?

10:34.125 --> 10:35.592
Whatever you like.

10:35.727 --> 10:37.217
Start with your name.

10:38.396 --> 10:39.863
Neil.

10:39.998 --> 10:44.264
Now take a big sip
of pop and belch.

10:47.472 --> 10:48.097
Shit.

10:48.806 --> 10:49.534
Good.

10:49.707 --> 10:51.140
Say that again.

10:51.309 --> 10:52.606
Shit.

10:52.744 --> 10:54.473
Again.

10:54.612 --> 10:58.343
Shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

10:58.483 --> 10:59.711
Shit.

10:59.851 --> 11:01.079
Hell!

11:01.219 --> 11:01.947
Damn!

11:02.086 --> 11:04.077
Now, look up
into the camera.

11:04.222 --> 11:05.553
Now stick your tongue out.

11:08.092 --> 11:09.992
Make a funny face.

11:10.128 --> 11:11.254
Good. Good.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.120
Yeah.

11:14.265 --> 11:15.425
Yes, Neil, yes.

11:15.566 --> 11:16.362
Yes.

11:20.571 --> 11:21.731
Open your mouth real wide.

11:26.044 --> 11:27.238
Neil, that's perfect.

11:31.749 --> 11:32.943
<i>July 2nd.</i>

11:33.084 --> 11:35.609
<i>We had a 7:30 game against</i>
<i>Hutchinson Taco Hut.</i>

11:35.753 --> 11:37.653
I know you're gonna kick
their butts tonight?

11:37.789 --> 11:39.484
You gonna knock one out
of the park for your poor,

11:39.624 --> 11:40.886
hard-working mom?

11:42.326 --> 11:43.918
So you're gonna get a ride
home with Coach, right?

11:44.062 --> 11:45.290
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:55.973 --> 11:59.306
You're mine and I love you
and don't you ever forget it.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.911
Boy, were you
on fire tonight!

12:08.052 --> 12:09.519
It's the best
you've ever played!

12:09.654 --> 12:10.313
Thanks, Coach.

12:11.789 --> 12:15.316
Hey, can we play some more of
those game cartridges tonight?

12:15.460 --> 12:16.620
Sure we can.

12:16.761 --> 12:18.228
But I gotta show
you something first.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.505
Ew.
I look stupid in this one.

12:35.646 --> 12:36.704
No.

12:36.848 --> 12:39.476
You look perfect.
Your expression.

12:39.617 --> 12:41.482
Like you're having
a wonderful dream.

12:44.789 --> 12:49.055
Neil, I've been thinking
a lot about you this week.

12:51.362 --> 12:52.454
I'm hungry.

12:53.865 --> 12:55.196
Sure.

12:55.333 --> 12:57.301
You want a pizza?

12:57.435 --> 12:59.232
I might have something
here you'd like.

13:03.441 --> 13:04.533
Whoa!

13:07.044 --> 13:08.773
What'll it be, little buddy?

13:08.913 --> 13:10.642
My mom never buys
these things.

13:10.782 --> 13:12.374
She says they're a
big waste of money.

13:12.517 --> 13:13.541
Let's eat then.

13:17.088 --> 13:18.248
Which one do you want?

13:18.389 --> 13:20.016
I don't know,
what are you having?

13:20.158 --> 13:21.250
Corn pops.

13:21.359 --> 13:22.553
Then I'll have uh <i>...</i>

13:23.594 --> 13:25.027
Cocoa Krispies.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.378
Shit.

13:42.513 --> 13:43.741
Sorry.

14:08.372 --> 14:09.464
You do one.

14:15.613 --> 14:16.307
Whew!

14:37.301 --> 14:38.427
Here we go.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.041
I like you, Neil.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.848
I like you so much.

15:02.727 --> 15:04.786
When I really, really
like someone <i>...</i>

15:13.471 --> 15:15.701
<i>...</i> there's a way I
show them how I feel.

15:22.813 --> 15:24.838
Shhh.

15:24.982 --> 15:28.349
Angel.

15:28.486 --> 15:31.284
There's nothing wrong with
kissing someone like this.

15:31.422 --> 15:34.914
Don't ever let any one
tell you that it's wrong.

15:45.202 --> 15:46.760
<i>It happened.</i>

15:46.938 --> 15:48.599
<i>That's what I told myself.</i>

15:48.773 --> 15:50.673
<i>It just happened.</i>

15:50.808 --> 15:52.639
<i>And after it was over,</i>
<i>I looked down...</i>

15:52.777 --> 15:54.472
<i>at the mess on the floor.</i>

15:54.612 --> 15:57.206
<i>It was like a kaleidoscope</i>
<i>had shattered.</i>

15:57.348 --> 16:01.751
<i>And when I swallowed, the taste</i>
<i>of Coach's tongue seared my mouth.</i>

16:02.853 --> 16:04.582
You liked it.

16:04.722 --> 16:07.316
It's okay that you liked it.

16:07.458 --> 16:09.358
Everything's gonna be okay.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.914
What are you doing?

16:33.951 --> 16:35.179
Do you know him
or something?

16:37.655 --> 16:39.282
I met Wendy Peterson
when I was ten.

16:39.423 --> 16:41.983
She was eleven, one grade
ahead of me in school.

16:45.363 --> 16:46.660
Damn. No razor.

16:46.797 --> 16:47.957
You're insane.

16:48.099 --> 16:50.260
If I wasn't queer we would
have ended up having <i>...</i>

16:50.401 --> 16:52.494
sloppy teenage sex and
getting pregnant <i>...</i>

16:52.670 --> 16:56.936
contributing more fucked up,
unwanted kids to society.

16:57.074 --> 17:00.840
But instead, she
became my soul-mate.

17:00.978 --> 17:04.505
And <i>...</i> one true
partner in crime.

17:05.683 --> 17:07.116
Let's kidnap him.

17:07.251 --> 17:10.345
His mom says we're
supposed to take him home.

17:13.391 --> 17:14.983
Where are you taking me?

17:15.126 --> 17:17.821
A house with lots
and lots of candy.

17:17.962 --> 17:19.395
Goody.

17:22.566 --> 17:26.229
<i>Beeewaaaaaaare.</i>
<i>Bewaaaare.</i>

17:26.404 --> 17:29.066
<i>Bewaaare.</i>

17:29.240 --> 17:33.677
These are the eyes of the
Axe Murderer's victims.

17:38.416 --> 17:41.317
- Come on, Satan.
- Hurry up, Chicken.

17:42.353 --> 17:44.651
<i>I never much cared</i>
<i>for Halloween,</i>

17:44.789 --> 17:47.087
<i>but this particular year,</i>
<i>I couldn't shake the feeling...</i>

17:47.224 --> 17:49.624
<i>that something</i>
<i>horrible was gonna happen.</i>

17:50.861 --> 17:52.658
<i>And there was nothing</i>
<i>I could do to stop it.</i>

17:52.797 --> 17:55.459
Wait outside for me.
I'll be done in a minute.

17:58.636 --> 18:00.695
You hold him while
I go get something.

18:00.871 --> 18:03.271
- What are we gonna do?
- Have some fun.

18:16.220 --> 18:19.587
- What's the matter, Satan?
- What did you say, Punk?

18:22.993 --> 18:24.426
What a loser!

18:24.562 --> 18:26.427
Loser!

18:27.364 --> 18:29.332
Loser!

18:43.114 --> 18:43.773
<i>Brian?</i>

18:46.884 --> 18:47.714
<i>Brian?</i>

18:50.921 --> 18:52.149
<i>I thought that was you.</i>

18:58.329 --> 18:59.387
<i>Lie down.</i>

18:59.530 --> 19:01.521
Lie down, retard.

19:02.800 --> 19:03.858
What are you doing?

19:04.001 --> 19:06.367
Shut up!
Shut up, or we'll kill you.

19:06.537 --> 19:08.061
Point the beam over here.

19:09.673 --> 19:10.697
Open your mouth.

19:10.875 --> 19:12.206
I said open your mouth.

19:14.011 --> 19:15.171
Keep these in y our
fucking mouth.

19:15.312 --> 19:19.942
You better do what we say,
or I'll kill you, I swear.

19:20.084 --> 19:22.018
Give me the matches.

19:22.153 --> 19:24.917
Wendy, come on, give me
the damn matches!

19:41.205 --> 19:42.672
Shine the flashlight on him.

19:44.808 --> 19:47.140
Neil, he's gonna tattle!

19:47.278 --> 19:49.246
Don't worry.
I know what to do.

19:49.413 --> 19:51.574
There are things we can
do to get him on our side.

19:53.384 --> 19:54.248
That's it.

19:54.385 --> 19:55.852
Just lay still for a minute.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.682
You're my little green buddy
and there's this cool thing <i>...</i>

19:58.822 --> 19:59.880
I wanna show you.

20:02.092 --> 20:04.390
When I was little, a man
used to do this to me.

20:04.528 --> 20:06.792
You're really gonna like it.

20:06.931 --> 20:08.762
There.
That's it.

20:08.899 --> 20:10.799
That's my boy.

20:10.935 --> 20:13.768
<i>Wendy never looked at me</i>
<i>quite the same after that night.</i>

20:13.938 --> 20:15.667
<i>Sharing this part of myself...</i>

20:15.839 --> 20:18.239
<i>I'd never showed</i>
<i>any one else ever before.</i>

20:18.375 --> 20:23.278
<i>I knew we'd be bound</i>
<i>together... forever.</i>

20:26.584 --> 20:29.382
<i>I woke up, once again not</i>
<i>knowing where I was...</i>

20:29.520 --> 20:31.488
<i>or what had happened to me.</i>

20:31.622 --> 20:33.749
<i>By the time I</i>
<i>made my way back,</i>

20:33.891 --> 20:36.416
<i>Deborah said I'd been</i>
<i>missing for over an hour.</i>

20:36.560 --> 20:38.494
<i>But I couldn't</i>
<i>remember a thing.</i>

20:38.629 --> 20:41.530
<i>All I knew was that it was somehow</i>
<i>linked to the other time,</i>

20:41.665 --> 20:44.156
<i>the night I</i>
<i>woke up in the cellar.</i>

20:44.301 --> 20:47.361
<i>And I also knew that,</i>
<i>no matter how long it took,</i>

20:47.538 --> 20:50.029
<i>I had to find out what</i>
<i>had happened to me.</i>

20:50.207 --> 20:52.539
<i>I had to find an</i>
<i>answer to the mystery.</i>

20:56.313 --> 20:59.441
<i>When I was 15, I overheard some</i>
<i>kids</i>
<i>at school talking about a place.</i>

20:59.583 --> 21:04.282
<i>A place that you could find even in</i>
<i>a dumb-ass hicktown like Hutchinson.</i>

21:20.871 --> 21:21.496
<i>Bingo.</i>

21:52.269 --> 21:53.167
Here we go.

22:05.983 --> 22:08.281
- How's it going?
- Okay.

22:09.953 --> 22:12.786
- I'm Charlie.
- Neil.

22:14.091 --> 22:15.183
Wanna go for a ride?

22:18.696 --> 22:19.492
Sure.

22:20.931 --> 22:22.228
You got cash?

22:22.366 --> 22:25.893
I'll pay 50, no higher.

22:26.036 --> 22:28.834
You've got to be
careful out here.

22:29.006 --> 22:31.839
The cops patrol this
whole entire area,

22:31.975 --> 22:34.341
and they've got brains
enough to know what's up.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.378
I'm in Hutchinson
on business.

22:36.513 --> 22:39.880
I supply snack foods
to the local markets.

22:40.017 --> 22:41.177
Go ahead.

22:41.318 --> 22:43.582
Take whatever you want.

22:50.427 --> 22:51.951
Hungry, huh?

23:01.505 --> 23:06.442
We've only got an hour,
so we'd better get busy.

23:12.783 --> 23:13.647
Wait.

23:15.085 --> 23:16.518
Let me.

23:26.029 --> 23:27.121
Beautiful.

23:33.070 --> 23:35.231
So, what do you like to do?

23:37.074 --> 23:39.042
Tell me what you
want me to do.

23:40.811 --> 23:41.903
Whatever.

23:47.351 --> 23:49.251
You like older guys, huh?

23:49.386 --> 23:50.648
Tell me.

23:51.422 --> 23:52.286
Yeah.

23:59.530 --> 24:01.430
That feels nice.

24:06.136 --> 24:11.802
You are such a beautiful,
beautiful boy.

24:49.446 --> 24:50.435
I'm gonna come.

24:53.083 --> 24:54.107
I'm gonna come.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.096
I know what you're thinking.

25:45.235 --> 25:46.896
That wasn't safe.

25:47.070 --> 25:48.867
But we're in
Kansas, thank God,

25:49.039 --> 25:51.599
not some big city
full of diseases.

25:53.544 --> 25:56.377
Plus, you're only a kid.

26:14.164 --> 26:14.858
Boo.

26:15.532 --> 26:16.897
Maniac.

26:17.034 --> 26:18.399
You scared me!

26:18.535 --> 26:19.433
Thanks for meeting me.

26:19.570 --> 26:21.231
Yeah, well,
This better be good.

26:21.338 --> 26:23.772
My mom will kill me if she
finds out I snuck out this late.

26:23.907 --> 26:25.238
I have something
I wanna show you.

26:30.814 --> 26:31.576
Ew.

26:40.490 --> 26:41.422
Look.

26:44.895 --> 26:46.658
Yeah. So?

26:47.831 --> 26:49.731
That's me.

26:56.039 --> 26:57.233
You're such a liar.

26:59.142 --> 27:00.575
I don't believe you.

27:00.711 --> 27:02.611
I'll prove it.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.179
Okay. How?

27:04.314 --> 27:05.872
Oh, my God, what are you <i>...</i>

27:06.016 --> 27:08.610
Put that back in your
pants, exhibitionist!

27:08.752 --> 27:09.446
Look.

27:09.586 --> 27:10.553
No way, perv.

27:10.687 --> 27:12.154
Look what the guy did to me.

27:20.831 --> 27:22.696
Are those bruises?

27:22.833 --> 27:25.927
Fucker gnawed on my dick like
it was a fucking candy cane.

27:26.069 --> 27:28.594
I didn't even realize he was hurting
me till after I blew my load.

27:28.772 --> 27:30.603
Well, you better
watch out, McCormick.

27:30.741 --> 27:33.232
Next time someone might
chomp the whole thing off.

27:34.978 --> 27:36.377
Seriously.

27:36.513 --> 27:38.606
Even Hutchinson has
its share of freaks.

27:38.749 --> 27:41.343
You trick with the wrong guy and
I'd find pieces of you everywhere.

27:41.485 --> 27:42.713
Okay, "Mom <i>".</i>

27:50.193 --> 27:52.491
I wish there's a movie
showing right now.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.620
Me too.

27:54.765 --> 27:56.892
A film about our lives.

27:57.034 --> 28:00.094
Everything's that's
happened o far.

28:00.270 --> 28:03.831
And the last scene would just
be us standing right here.

28:04.007 --> 28:06.441
Just you and me.

28:09.846 --> 28:11.108
Yeah.

28:27.197 --> 28:28.459
I hear something.

28:33.970 --> 28:35.562
It's the voice of God.

28:50.320 --> 28:51.548
I hear him.

28:58.628 --> 28:59.856
I hear him.

29:17.380 --> 29:18.404
Mom!

29:18.548 --> 29:20.106
It's about to begin.

29:20.250 --> 29:21.615
Alright, I'm coming.

29:23.253 --> 29:24.242
VCR on?

29:24.387 --> 29:25.911
I checked it twice.

29:26.056 --> 29:28.547
It's probably going
to be a little silly.

29:28.692 --> 29:30.853
The commercial showed this
crazy old man claiming <i>...</i>

29:30.994 --> 29:33.622
aliens beamed him up right
out of his bathtub.

29:36.266 --> 29:39.531
If you're going to make fun,
I'd just as soon watch by myself.

29:41.238 --> 29:42.865
Shh, it's starting.

29:43.039 --> 29:45.405
<i>Tonight on "World</i>
<i>Of Mystery",</i>

29:45.542 --> 29:49.273
<i>we investigate the</i>
<i>terrifying world of UFOs.</i>

29:49.412 --> 29:53.644
<i>Is it mass hysteria or</i>
<i>something all too real?</i>

29:53.784 --> 29:56.082
<i>They kept me</i>
<i>prisoner for hours.</i>

29:56.219 --> 30:02.021
<i>They examined me like I was</i>
<i>a frog in biology class.</i>

30:02.159 --> 30:05.424
<i>And then they stuck a</i>
<i>probe in my stomach.</i>

30:05.562 --> 30:08.998
<i>I still got the scar</i>
<i>here to prove it.</i>

30:10.801 --> 30:11.961
<i>Look at that.</i>

30:12.102 --> 30:15.902
<i>I always got scared anytime</i>
<i>I watched movies about UFOs.</i>

30:16.072 --> 30:18.336
<i>Even "E.T." scared me.</i>

30:18.475 --> 30:19.772
Poor thing.

30:19.910 --> 30:21.901
She looks so homely and sad.

30:22.078 --> 30:27.880
<i>Avalyn Friesen lives in the tiny,</i>
<i>ordinary town of Inman, Kansas.</i>

30:28.018 --> 30:29.280
Inman?

30:30.086 --> 30:31.713
That's only 30 miles away.

30:32.189 --> 30:34.180
<i>32 years old,</i>
<i>she is unmarried.</i>

30:34.324 --> 30:36.588
<i>Lives with her father</i>

<i>as a secretary.</i>

30:38.195 --> 30:40.925
<i>But there is something</i>

30:41.064 --> 30:42.554
<i>For as long as</i>
<i>she can remember,</i>

30:42.699 --> 30:46.157
<i>things have happened to her,</i>
<i>things she cannot explain.</i>

30:46.303 --> 30:49.466
<i>I'd heard about people who've</i>
<i>experienced missing time.</i>

30:49.639 --> 30:53.166
<i>Whole chunks of their lives</i>
<i>they couldn't account for.</i>

30:53.343 --> 30:56.506
<i>Under hypnotic regression</i>
<i>I learned that...</i>

30:56.646 --> 30:59.376
<i>I had been abducted</i>
<i>more than 20 times.</i>

30:59.516 --> 31:00.676
Oh, please!

31:00.817 --> 31:01.579
Quiet.

31:01.718 --> 31:03.652
<i>The first time</i>
<i>was when I was 6.</i>

31:03.787 --> 31:07.188
<i>I was on my way home from a</i>
<i>picnic with my grandparents.</i>

31:07.324 --> 31:10.919
<i>It was dark and we got lost,</i>
<i>driving down a dirt road.</i>

31:11.061 --> 31:14.394
<i>Grandpa lost control of the</i>
<i>car and we went in to a ditch.</i>

31:14.531 --> 31:17.022
<i>There was this</i>
<i>blinding white light.</i>

31:17.167 --> 31:20.762
<i>But the aliens weren't</i>
<i>interested in my grandparents.</i>

31:20.937 --> 31:23.167
<i>They floated me up</i>
<i>out of the car...</i>

31:23.340 --> 31:26.605
<i>using some sort</i>
<i>of gravitational ray.</i>

31:29.179 --> 31:30.840
That's it.
I've had enough.

31:30.981 --> 31:32.107
I'm gonna get some ice cream.

31:32.249 --> 31:34.513
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

31:34.651 --> 31:36.482
<i>I remember lying on a table.</i>

31:36.620 --> 31:39.680
<i>It was cold,</i>
<i>smooth and shiny.</i>

31:39.823 --> 31:41.518
<i>The aliens surrounded me.</i>

31:41.658 --> 31:46.755
<i>They were bald with huge</i>
<i>marshmallowy heads and tiny arms.</i>

31:46.897 --> 31:49.957
<i>But the worst part</i>
<i>was their eyes.</i>

31:50.100 --> 31:52.330
<i>The only way I can</i>
<i>describe them is big,</i>

31:52.469 --> 31:55.768
<i>black diamonds,</i>
<i>all liquidy and jellyish.</i>

32:20.297 --> 32:24.563
I can't believe I'm finally getting
out of this fucking nowhere town!

32:24.701 --> 32:27.363
You better let me know
the second you're settled.

32:28.939 --> 32:29.997
Or else.

32:30.173 --> 32:33.939
You better come.
Or else.

32:34.077 --> 32:35.101
New York City.

32:35.278 --> 32:36.711
You're so lucky!

32:46.556 --> 32:48.353
Hey, assface.

32:48.491 --> 32:50.254
What you gawking at?

32:57.067 --> 32:58.193
Faggots!

32:58.335 --> 33:00.667
Shit, go, go, go!

33:04.474 --> 33:05.998
Fuck you!

33:21.591 --> 33:23.115
Remember the guy I told
you about last week?

33:23.259 --> 33:24.283
White Camaro?

33:24.427 --> 33:26.759
That's him.
Parked by those trees.

33:26.896 --> 33:29.023
I've fucked every single
john in this park.

33:29.165 --> 33:31.030
Except for White Camaro.

33:31.835 --> 33:33.928
So it's time for
you two to get lost.

33:34.104 --> 33:35.731
Stop scaring my
business away.

33:37.374 --> 33:38.966
You want us to come
pick you up later?

33:39.142 --> 33:40.166
Yeah, if you want.

33:40.343 --> 33:42.004
I'll be done by, like, 7.

33:42.145 --> 33:43.612
We'll meet you.

33:43.780 --> 33:45.213
Speak for yourself, Eric.

33:45.348 --> 33:46.781
I gotta get home
and start packing.

33:46.916 --> 33:47.712
Alright, call me tonight.

33:48.651 --> 33:49.743
I'll see you later.

33:58.695 --> 34:00.390
You better be careful.

34:00.530 --> 34:02.054
Of what?

34:03.166 --> 34:04.224
I'm serious, Eric.

34:04.367 --> 34:06.164
You're not in
Modesto anymore.

34:06.302 --> 34:08.202
I see the way
you look at him.

34:09.371 --> 34:10.862
He's so beautiful.

34:12.542 --> 34:14.100
I can't help it.

34:14.277 --> 34:16.302
He's like a god.

34:16.478 --> 34:20.279
You don't have to tell me, I
was infatuated with him too once.

34:22.152 --> 34:24.120
But I know all Neil's secrets
and there's shit there <i>...</i>

34:24.254 --> 34:25.777
you don't even want
to know about.

34:25.922 --> 34:27.480
Trust me.

34:28.391 --> 34:29.983
Once I'm gone, you'll
be all Neil has <i>...</i>

34:30.126 --> 34:32.560
and you have to
understand one thing.

34:32.695 --> 34:34.094
Where normal people
have a heart,

34:34.230 --> 34:37.222
Neil McCormick's has a
bottomless black hole.

34:37.367 --> 34:42.202
And if you don't watch out, you can
fall in and get lost forever.

34:51.246 --> 34:51.838
Ahh.

35:14.938 --> 35:17.031
<i>Brian?</i>
<i>Brian, you home?</i>

35:17.207 --> 35:19.141
Yeah, Mom.
In here.

35:28.685 --> 35:29.879
No class today?

35:30.019 --> 35:33.511
I've got English Comp
discussion group at 7:30.

35:33.656 --> 35:35.123
You have mail.

35:35.258 --> 35:36.725
Looks like one
from your sister.

35:36.860 --> 35:39.920
And one from <i>"</i> A. Friesen <i>"</i> ?

35:42.765 --> 35:44.460
I can't believe
she wrote me back.

35:44.601 --> 35:45.761
Who?

35:45.902 --> 35:48.962
Avalyn Friesen.
The woman on TV.

35:49.139 --> 35:52.074
She didn't have to dump a whole
gallon of perfume on it, did she?

35:55.011 --> 35:56.672
What did she say?

35:56.813 --> 35:58.872
She wants me to
visit her in Inman.

36:22.972 --> 36:24.439
Thanks for the ride, Preston.

36:27.076 --> 36:28.065
Later.

36:34.651 --> 36:36.084
You just missed it, sweetie.

36:36.219 --> 36:39.347
This little old lady
just won both showcases.

36:41.824 --> 36:43.553
What did she get?

36:43.693 --> 36:48.528
She got a trip to Scotland,
beautiful living room set,

36:48.665 --> 36:50.098
a brand new car.

36:51.768 --> 36:54.737
I can't remember the name of
it but it cost over 27 grand.

36:58.942 --> 37:00.341
Are you wearing cologne?

37:03.213 --> 37:04.237
Was work okay?

37:05.081 --> 37:06.673
It was the pits.

37:08.818 --> 37:10.877
When is our ship
gonna come in, huh baby?

37:11.020 --> 37:12.954
Soon, Ma.

37:15.358 --> 37:16.256
Soon.

37:21.497 --> 37:23.124
Oh, Neil, don't forget.

37:23.266 --> 37:26.429
Tomorrow's my date.
That hot Italian.

37:26.569 --> 37:29.470
The guy who always comes
through my checkout lane.

37:29.606 --> 37:31.437
Don't worry, because
I'll be at work.

37:31.574 --> 37:33.474
It's the last tournament
of the season.

37:33.610 --> 37:35.043
Vincenzo.

38:19.856 --> 38:20.788
Brian!

38:23.926 --> 38:24.915
Brian, hey!

38:25.061 --> 38:26.790
Patches!
Patches, down.

38:26.929 --> 38:28.624
Sorry, she gets a
little excited.

38:28.765 --> 38:31.598
Hi, you must be Brian.
I'm Avalyn, obviously.

38:31.734 --> 38:34.931
Dad?
It's okay, Daddy.

38:35.104 --> 38:37.368
This is the young man
I was telling you about.

38:39.842 --> 38:40.831
Don't mind him.

38:41.010 --> 38:43.035
He's just a little
wary of strangers.

38:43.212 --> 38:46.238
I'm so glad you're here.
Come on.

38:48.451 --> 38:52.012
It isn't showy, but it's home.
Here, have a seat.

38:52.155 --> 38:54.715
Have you eaten?
I was just in the middle of lunch.

38:54.857 --> 38:58.588
- I hope you don't mind.
- No, go ahead. I ate earlier.

38:58.728 --> 39:00.320
So, you saw the show?

39:01.564 --> 39:04.658
Several times.
I videotaped it.

39:04.801 --> 39:08.669
They left some stuff out, but they
managed to get the major points
across.

39:11.974 --> 39:13.965
I think I was taken too.

39:14.143 --> 39:15.872
You mentioned that
in your letter.

39:16.012 --> 39:18.344
You're at the point I
was a few years ago,

39:18.481 --> 39:20.278
where you're just starting
to remember things.

39:20.416 --> 39:22.714
There are many of us and
we all have this drive <i>...</i>

39:22.852 --> 39:24.149
to know what happened.

39:24.287 --> 39:27.688
So <i>...</i> you think that's
what happened to me.

39:27.824 --> 39:30.816
Just from what I told you
about the missing time and <i>...</i>

39:30.960 --> 39:32.450
I'm sure of it.

39:35.431 --> 39:37.058
Feel like going on a walk?

39:38.735 --> 39:39.929
What's that you're carrying?

39:40.069 --> 39:42.333
It's a Dream Journal.

39:42.505 --> 39:44.996
I keep a log of
all my dreams.

39:45.174 --> 39:48.143
Whatever bits and pieces
I can recall at least.

39:49.879 --> 39:52.245
I feel like it's slowly
helping me remember.

39:52.382 --> 39:53.713
That's a really good idea.

39:53.850 --> 39:56.375
Your subconscious is where
all your memories are buried.

39:56.519 --> 39:59.113
For you and me and people
like us almost every <i>...</i>

39:59.255 --> 40:02.190
single thing we do stems
from our being abducted.

40:02.325 --> 40:04.919
Come here, I want to show you
something they wouldn't allow <i>...</i>

40:05.061 --> 40:06.426
on <i>"</i> World of Mystery <i>".</i>

40:10.366 --> 40:11.924
I've been tagged.

40:12.068 --> 40:13.831
Part of their experiments.

40:14.003 --> 40:15.095
Touch it.

40:18.040 --> 40:20.235
When I was taken,
my leg was bleeding,

40:20.376 --> 40:22.810
but I didn't remember
being cut, nothing.

40:22.945 --> 40:27.041
Then, under hypnosis is when
I discovered that's where <i>...</i>

40:27.183 --> 40:29.117
they implant the
tracking device.

40:29.252 --> 40:31.311
Now everything
I do, they know.

40:31.454 --> 40:32.887
In fact, I wouldn't be
surprised if they were <i>...</i>

40:33.022 --> 40:35.217
spying on us right now.

40:35.358 --> 40:39.988
When I was found that
night, my nose was bleeding.

40:40.129 --> 40:44.065
The old up-the-nose trick,
so the scar can't be seen.

40:47.336 --> 40:48.997
Don't forget to write.

40:51.874 --> 40:53.774
Don't you forget
what I told you.

40:53.910 --> 40:55.207
Okay.

40:59.715 --> 41:01.979
You better come see
me soon, asshole.

41:02.118 --> 41:04.211
I will.

41:08.124 --> 41:09.182
I will.

41:40.056 --> 41:41.546
Stay out of trouble, you two.

41:46.329 --> 41:47.227
Bye.

41:55.938 --> 41:59.430
I can't believe it's so late.
My mom's gonna worry.

41:59.609 --> 42:01.042
You still live with your mom?

42:01.177 --> 42:03.941
My dad moved out 7 years ago.

42:04.080 --> 42:05.741
I don't see him much.

42:05.882 --> 42:08.578
You wanna read me
one of your dreams?

42:08.718 --> 42:12.711
I just, y u know, scribble them
out in the middle of the night.

42:12.855 --> 42:15.483
Sometimes I can
barely even read them.

42:15.625 --> 42:16.785
That's okay.

42:27.136 --> 42:28.694
This is from 2 nights ago.

42:31.574 --> 42:34.065
<i>"</i> There's a blue light.

42:34.243 --> 42:36.677
I'm in my Little
League uniform,

42:36.846 --> 42:40.145
and a tall alien is
hovering over me <i>."</i>

42:40.283 --> 42:46.654
<i>"</i> Someone else is with me.
Another boy, also in uniform <i>."</i>

42:46.789 --> 42:48.916
<i>"</i> Panther? <i>"</i>

42:49.058 --> 42:51.788
That was the name
of my baseball team.

42:54.764 --> 42:56.561
Let's see, uh <i>...</i>

42:56.699 --> 43:04.663
<i>"</i> The alien has big black eyes.
He's touching my face <i>."</i>

43:04.840 --> 43:09.334
<i>"</i> I want to cry out
for help, but <i>..."</i>

43:09.512 --> 43:14.916
<i>"</i> I can't. I can't <i>."</i>

43:15.051 --> 43:18.077
You're on your way to
uncovering the truth.

43:18.220 --> 43:20.711
Think of yourself as a
detective, following clues.

43:20.856 --> 43:23.086
Maybe concentrate on the
other boy in your dreams,

43:23.225 --> 43:25.716
he could help you find the
answers you're looking for.

43:29.165 --> 43:30.097
<i>Two outs.</i>

43:30.232 --> 43:32.530
<i>Third baseman Jackson up,</i>
<i>with Hinton...</i>

43:32.668 --> 43:33.532
on deck.

43:35.237 --> 43:37.102
Jesus.
Check out that Jackson.

43:37.239 --> 43:38.604
Hubba hubba.

43:38.741 --> 43:40.106
Ew <i>...</i>

43:40.242 --> 43:41.675
are you joking?

43:41.811 --> 43:43.870
No, I'd fuck him for free.

43:46.382 --> 43:49.249
Please return all foul
balls to pressbox.

43:49.385 --> 43:50.249
Thank you.

43:51.220 --> 43:52.619
You don't think
Jackson's hot?

43:52.755 --> 43:57.158
Dude, he's fat and bald!

43:57.293 --> 43:59.784
Different folks,
different strokes.

44:01.097 --> 44:02.462
My Daddy hit this.

44:04.567 --> 44:07.035
Well, come here, come on in,
collect your prize.

44:08.137 --> 44:10.765
Thank you so much.
One second <i>...</i>

44:13.809 --> 44:15.174
Alright <i>...</i>
what will it be, big guy?

44:15.311 --> 44:16.903
Cash or bubbles?

44:17.980 --> 44:20.608
You can't decide.
Alright, hold out your hand.

44:25.755 --> 44:28.053
- Thanks!
- You're welcome.

44:29.558 --> 44:30.547
See you later.

44:33.729 --> 44:34.525
What?

44:34.664 --> 44:36.598
When kids do good,
you gotta reward them.

44:36.732 --> 44:37.630
Oh, Christ.

44:37.767 --> 44:41.498
It's Hinton,
a.k.a <i>. "</i> Ass of the Gods <i>".</i>

44:41.671 --> 44:45.004
I am so, fucking wasted!

44:46.842 --> 44:48.275
Oh, shit!

44:49.478 --> 44:51.412
- Where's your mom?
- I don't know.

44:51.580 --> 44:54.981
She's probably out with her
new boyfriend, Vincenzo.

45:00.022 --> 45:02.547
I've got a wicked headache.

45:02.692 --> 45:05.627
- Do you have any pot?
- Yeah. Come on.

45:15.371 --> 45:17.805
Here.
Knock yourself out.

45:21.844 --> 45:25.007
There's a porno in the
VCR if you wanna jack off.

45:26.082 --> 45:27.208
Thanks.

45:28.451 --> 45:29.611
You got a lighter?

45:31.587 --> 45:33.248
Yeah. Here.

47:26.468 --> 47:27.594
<i>You like that?</i>

47:27.770 --> 47:29.328
<i>It tickles a little.</i>

47:29.505 --> 47:31.973
<i>That feels good,</i>
<i>doesn't it, Neil?</i>

47:32.141 --> 47:33.438
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

47:33.576 --> 47:36.636
<i>Can we put the blanket over our</i>
<i>heads like we did last time?</i>

47:39.248 --> 47:40.442
<i>Here we go.</i>

47:47.356 --> 47:48.880
Find what you
were looking for?

47:49.024 --> 47:52.551
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.

47:52.695 --> 47:53.957
Glad I could help out.

47:54.096 --> 47:56.587
I used to write for
my school paper too,

47:56.732 --> 47:58.029
back in the day.

47:58.167 --> 48:00.863
Well, this will really make a
big difference in my article.

48:01.003 --> 48:02.994
Maybe you'll win
a Pulitzer Prize.

48:03.172 --> 48:04.230
Maybe.

48:04.406 --> 48:06.931
Just let me know if there's
anything else you need.

48:07.109 --> 48:08.542
Thanks so much.

48:20.155 --> 48:21.850
You done already?

48:21.991 --> 48:24.289
I'm on kind of a
tight deadline.

48:24.426 --> 48:26.018
Well, good luck.

48:27.062 --> 48:29.223
<i>That's two outs.</i>
<i>Garfield the batter...</i>

48:29.365 --> 48:30.457
Heim on deck.

48:36.238 --> 48:37.967
<i>Scoot your chair back</i>
<i>a little further.</i>

48:39.708 --> 48:41.005
<i>That's better.</i>

48:52.254 --> 48:53.585
Wait.
Hold on a sec.

48:54.757 --> 48:56.884
And at the end of 3
innings, the score is <i>...</i>

48:57.026 --> 48:58.687
Hutchinson First
National Bank, 3;

48:58.827 --> 49:01.057
Wichita Coleman
Industries, 0.

49:01.630 --> 49:02.688
Okay. Go on.

49:08.604 --> 49:09.628
Where have you been?

49:09.805 --> 49:11.636
Sorry.
I should've called.

49:11.774 --> 49:13.366
I didn't realize the time.

49:13.542 --> 49:15.703
Well, your dinner's
cold as ice.

49:15.844 --> 49:17.471
That's okay.

49:19.214 --> 49:20.909
Brian, what's going on?

49:21.050 --> 49:22.881
You've been acting
so strangely.

49:23.018 --> 49:24.383
Disappearing for hours.

49:24.520 --> 49:26.181
It's just school, Mom.

49:26.322 --> 49:28.290
College is way different
than high school.

49:28.424 --> 49:30.119
Did you ever call
your father back?

49:30.259 --> 49:31.988
I've been busy.

49:33.295 --> 49:34.762
I'll get it.
You finish your dinner.

49:36.632 --> 49:37.656
Hello?

49:37.800 --> 49:39.097
Yes.

49:39.234 --> 49:41.099
He's eating his
supper right now.

49:41.270 --> 49:43.704
- Who is it?
- It's that UFO woman.

49:45.341 --> 49:46.399
I'll get it in the hall.

49:49.111 --> 49:49.839
Got it.

49:52.748 --> 49:53.772
Brian?

49:53.916 --> 49:55.406
I was just going
to call you.

49:55.551 --> 49:57.178
I found a photo of the boy.

49:57.319 --> 49:59.048
The one from my dreams.

49:59.188 --> 50:00.382
That's amazing.

50:00.522 --> 50:01.784
What are you
doing right now?

50:01.924 --> 50:03.482
Nothing.

50:03.625 --> 50:04.819
There's something
I need to show you.

50:04.960 --> 50:06.825
Something important.
Can you come out here?

50:06.962 --> 50:08.623
Sure.

50:10.766 --> 50:12.358
Hi, honey.
How was work?

50:12.501 --> 50:13.661
Fuck you.

50:24.580 --> 50:29.711
I'm so fuckin' sick of this
stinky little buttcrack of a town!

50:45.667 --> 50:46.998
Patches, shhh, quiet!

50:47.136 --> 50:48.160
You'll wake Daddy.

50:48.337 --> 50:49.964
Brian!
Thanks for coming.

50:50.139 --> 50:51.834
No problem.

50:52.841 --> 50:55.708
I stole this from the
Hutchinson Chamber of Commerce.

50:55.844 --> 50:58.608
That's him.
The boy from my dreams.

50:58.747 --> 51:00.078
Look at his face.

51:00.215 --> 51:02.240
It's almost like you can
tell he knows something.

51:05.154 --> 51:06.086
What are you doing?

51:14.196 --> 51:15.424
<i>"</i> N.McCormick <i>."</i>

51:15.564 --> 51:17.122
You can start looking for
him first thing tomorrow morning.

51:17.266 --> 51:19.200
Maybe he still
lives in Hutchinson.

51:19.334 --> 51:22.735
Meanwhile, I have to show you
something only you will understand.

51:25.741 --> 51:30.644
I've fucked every single guy and
his ugly uncle in this podunk town.

51:30.813 --> 51:32.110
Twice.

51:40.389 --> 51:40.912
You want one?

51:42.324 --> 51:44.087
One of us has to drive.

51:48.097 --> 51:49.792
I got a postcard from Wendy.

51:49.932 --> 51:53.299
I think she's mad at me
because I owe her like 3 letters.

51:53.435 --> 51:55.232
Yeah, her last P.S. is <i>...</i>

51:55.404 --> 51:57.838
<i>"</i> Tell Fuckface
to write me <i>".</i>

51:57.973 --> 51:59.133
So you wanna hear
what she says?

52:03.645 --> 52:04.475
<i>"</i> Hey, ass.

52:04.613 --> 52:07.480
So New York is insane and
crazy in the best possible way <i>".</i>

52:07.616 --> 52:08.139
Pardon me.

52:10.219 --> 52:11.709
Can we help you?

52:11.854 --> 52:14.414
I was wondering if I might
buy you boys a drink.

52:14.556 --> 52:16.080
Fuck off.

52:18.327 --> 52:19.624
You heard me, fag.

52:19.761 --> 52:21.729
Fuck.<i>..</i> off.

52:21.864 --> 52:24.094
Stuck up little pricks.

52:24.233 --> 52:25.962
Harsh.

52:26.101 --> 52:27.625
Wasn't he kinda your type?

52:28.303 --> 52:31.272
I hate it when they look like
Tarzan and sound like Jane.

52:31.440 --> 52:33.340
Let's get out of
this shithole.

52:34.810 --> 52:36.437
But we just got here!

52:37.813 --> 52:40.373
Patches.
Patches!

52:40.516 --> 52:42.541
Patches, get
away from there!

52:45.888 --> 52:47.651
Farmers have been finding
mutilated cattle like this <i>...</i>

52:47.789 --> 52:49.256
around here for years.

52:49.391 --> 52:53.384
I told <i>"</i> World of Mystery <i>",</i> but
they conveniently edited it out.

52:53.529 --> 52:55.759
Daddy says it's just a bunch
of <i>"</i> Satan worshippers <i>"...</i>

52:55.898 --> 52:57.763
going around chopping up cows.

52:57.900 --> 53:00.232
Ha! Come here.

53:00.369 --> 53:01.700
Let me see your hand.

53:03.705 --> 53:05.400
Feel that?

53:05.574 --> 53:07.064
Its sex organs.

53:07.242 --> 53:09.039
They're gone.

53:09.178 --> 53:11.510
The aliens, they experiment
on cattle because the <i>...</i>

53:11.647 --> 53:13.444
poor things are so defenceless.

53:13.582 --> 53:15.516
Us, on the other hand,
they can't kill us,

53:15.651 --> 53:17.448
so they just leave behind
the hidden memories <i>...</i>

53:17.586 --> 53:18.746
of what they've done.

53:18.887 --> 53:21.117
Which in a way
is almost worse.

53:21.256 --> 53:23.190
Notice anything
else strange?

53:23.325 --> 53:24.883
There's no blood.

53:25.027 --> 53:26.551
They took that, too.

53:37.339 --> 53:38.397
Brian?

53:38.574 --> 53:39.905
Oh, my God, Brian!

53:41.977 --> 53:43.171
Brian!

53:48.951 --> 53:49.975
<i>Here we go.</i>

53:50.118 --> 53:51.745
Oh, my God.
Brian.

53:52.688 --> 53:54.178
<i>Tell him you like it.</i>

53:55.958 --> 53:56.686
Brian!

53:56.825 --> 53:58.315
Oh, Brian, are you okay?

53:58.460 --> 53:59.791
Oh, God.

53:59.928 --> 54:00.622
Brian?

54:01.830 --> 54:02.797
Brian!

54:03.532 --> 54:05.966
Neil. What are you doing?

54:06.668 --> 54:09.694
Come on.
It's 2:30 in the morning.

54:11.607 --> 54:15.976
You called me
your fucking.<i>..</i> angel.

54:20.215 --> 54:22.046
Are you sure Wendy's going
to meet you at the station?

54:22.184 --> 54:24.084
I don't want you getting
lost in that crazy city.

54:24.219 --> 54:25.618
Ma, you don't have
to worry, okay?

54:25.754 --> 54:27.984
Call me collect the
minute you arrive.

54:28.123 --> 54:29.147
- Promise me.
- Okay.

54:29.291 --> 54:30.519
Promise me, Neil.

54:30.659 --> 54:32.024
Okay.

54:35.897 --> 54:38.525
We should've at least gotten
you a decent hair cut.

54:41.603 --> 54:43.298
I have to take a piss.

54:43.472 --> 54:44.837
Preston?

54:46.074 --> 54:47.268
We'll be right back.

54:50.312 --> 54:52.212
- Fuck, man!
- What's the matter?

54:52.881 --> 54:53.370
I don't know.

54:53.515 --> 54:56.916
My fucking dick itches
like motherfucking fuck!

54:57.052 --> 54:59.680
What do you want
me to do about it?

54:59.821 --> 55:01.311
Just look down there.

55:01.456 --> 55:04.118
Preston, come on,
help me out here.

55:06.762 --> 55:08.127
What the fuck's
wrong with me?

55:10.165 --> 55:13.225
Dude.
You've got crabs.

55:17.472 --> 55:18.871
I mean, it's no big, man.

55:19.007 --> 55:21.635
You just go to the drug store
and get this stuff called Rid.

55:24.446 --> 55:26.676
You better be
playing safe.

55:26.815 --> 55:27.873
I stay in control.

55:29.951 --> 55:31.714
Honey, your bus is boarding.

55:31.853 --> 55:32.820
Alright.

55:40.929 --> 55:42.487
My baby.

55:42.631 --> 55:44.462
You're all grown up.

55:49.738 --> 55:51.296
You gonna be careful?

55:51.473 --> 55:53.407
Yeah, I will.

56:00.015 --> 56:03.178
You're mine and I love you.
Don't you ever forget it.

56:25.440 --> 56:27.305
Come on.
I'll buy you Dairy Queen.

56:28.043 --> 56:30.273
So what are you gonna
do now that Neil's gone?

56:30.412 --> 56:33.745
- Kill myself, I guess.
- Eric, that is not funny.

56:33.882 --> 56:36.976
Well, I start Hutchinson
Community College next week.

56:37.119 --> 56:39.610
Really?
That's so wonderful.

56:39.755 --> 56:41.586
Pathetic is more like it.

56:41.723 --> 56:43.384
Well, you know you are
always welcome to come over <i>...</i>

56:43.525 --> 56:45.755
to the house, even
without Neil around.

56:45.894 --> 56:49.455
Thanks, Mrs. M. I may
just take you up on that.

56:49.598 --> 56:50.724
You better.

56:55.470 --> 56:57.267
Who the hell is that?

56:57.439 --> 56:59.600
Incognito Boy Scout?

57:05.947 --> 57:07.938
Can I help you?

57:08.083 --> 57:11.382
- Is this your house?
- Yes.

57:11.520 --> 57:13.681
I'm really sorry
to bother you,

57:13.822 --> 57:16.313
but I got your address
out of the phonebook.

57:16.458 --> 57:18.289
I've spent the whole
afternoon checking every <i>...</i>

57:18.427 --> 57:21.624
McCormick in Hutchinson and
you're the last one on my list.

57:21.763 --> 57:23.731
Anyway, I don't
mean to babble <i>...</i>

57:23.865 --> 57:25.457
What do you want?

57:27.602 --> 57:29.331
I'm looking for an N.McCormick.

57:29.504 --> 57:30.937
Are you FBI?

57:31.106 --> 57:34.598
Sorry honey, but it looks
like you are shit outta luck.

57:34.776 --> 57:38.337
You mean there's no
N.McCormick living here?

57:38.480 --> 57:42.280
I mean we just put him on
a bus headed for New York City.

57:45.086 --> 57:48.317
I'm Neil's friend, Eric,
and this is his Mom.

57:48.457 --> 57:52.860
<i>"</i> Neil <i>"</i> ?
His name is Neil?

57:52.994 --> 57:54.086
Yeah.

57:56.665 --> 57:59.759
I'm Brian.
Brian Lackey.

58:11.646 --> 58:12.908
<i>So you still</i>
<i>haven't written.</i>

58:13.048 --> 58:14.242
<i>Big surprise.</i>

58:14.382 --> 58:16.543
<i>But Wendy says you're</i>
<i>doing okay, which is cool.</i>

58:16.685 --> 58:18.710
<i>I've been wanting to tell</i>
<i>you about this strange guy...</i>

58:18.854 --> 58:20.287
<i>I met 3 weeks ago.</i>

58:20.422 --> 58:21.684
<i>No, we're not fucking.</i>

58:21.823 --> 58:23.882
<i>Get your mind out</i>
<i>of the gutter, perv.</i>

58:24.025 --> 58:25.754
<i>He's not even gay,</i>
<i>I don't think.</i>

58:25.894 --> 58:29.557
<i>In fact, his vibe is</i>
<i>kinda weirdly asexual.</i>

58:29.698 --> 58:31.131
<i>His name is Brian Lackey.</i>

58:31.266 --> 58:32.961
<i>He lives in Little River</i>
<i>and, like yours truly,</i>

58:33.101 --> 58:35.592
<i>attends Hutchinson</i>
<i>Loser Community College.</i>

58:35.770 --> 58:37.431
<i>Anyways, the day you left...</i>

58:37.606 --> 58:40.097
<i>...your mom and I found him</i>
<i>literally on your doorstep,</i>

58:40.275 --> 58:41.264
<i>looking for you.</i>

58:41.443 --> 58:43.206
<i>He says you and him played</i>
<i>Little League together...</i>

58:43.345 --> 58:44.642
<i>like 10 years ago.</i>

58:44.779 --> 58:47.976
<i>He was the worst player on the</i>
<i>team, blah, blah, blah...</i>

58:48.116 --> 58:49.811
<i>He's full of</i>
<i>questions about you.</i>

58:49.951 --> 58:51.885
<i>But, of course, I</i>
<i>haven't told him much,</i>

58:52.020 --> 58:54.420
<i>i.e. about your</i>
<i>"line of work".</i>

58:54.556 --> 58:55.955
<i>I did say you were</i>
<i>queer like me,</i>

58:56.091 --> 58:58.059
<i>only because I figured</i>
<i>you wouldn't care.</i>

58:58.193 --> 59:01.060
<i>But now, are you ready</i>
<i>for the good part?</i>

59:01.196 --> 59:03.061
<i>He thinks that when you</i>
<i>and him were little...</i>

59:03.198 --> 59:06.725
<i>...you were both abducted</i>
<i>and examined by space aliens.</i>

59:06.868 --> 59:08.665
<i>How brilliant is that?</i>

59:08.837 --> 59:11.101
<i>But he was completely</i>
<i>serious when he told me this.</i>

59:11.273 --> 59:13.400
<i>Like you should've seen</i>
<i>the look in his eyes.</i>

59:13.575 --> 59:15.042
<i>So, what's the story, dude?</i>

59:15.210 --> 59:18.373
<i>Were you abducted</i>
<i>by a UFO or what?</i>

59:18.513 --> 59:21.038
<i>P.S. - Are your crabs gone yet?</i>

59:28.657 --> 59:31.490
<i>- Brian?</i>
- Yeah?

59:34.262 --> 59:36.093
- You have a visitor.
- Hi Brian.

59:36.231 --> 59:38.222
I was just in the neighbourhood
and I thought I'd stop by,

59:38.366 --> 59:39.390
see how you're doing.

59:42.137 --> 59:44.002
I'll be in the front
room if you need me.

59:44.139 --> 59:45.436
Thanks, Mom.

59:49.377 --> 59:51.345
Didn't care for that film.

59:51.513 --> 59:53.310
That, I didn't see.

59:53.448 --> 59:56.178
Your Mom doesn't
like me very much.

59:56.318 --> 59:58.650
She thinks I'm trying
to steal you away.

59:58.787 --> 01:00:01.483
Any luck in your
search for "N.McCormick <i>"</i> ?

01:00:01.623 --> 01:00:04.558
I met his mom and
his best friend,

01:00:04.693 --> 01:00:06.854
but he's in New York right now.

01:00:06.995 --> 01:00:09.088
New York. Really?

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.662
Here. Sit down.

01:00:20.609 --> 01:00:22.577
Had any more of
those dreams?

01:00:22.744 --> 01:00:24.678
Yeah.

01:00:24.813 --> 01:00:28.146
But they seem to
be slowly evolving.

01:00:28.283 --> 01:00:30.376
Maybe it's just because I've
been spending a lot of time <i>...</i>

01:00:30.518 --> 01:00:33.487
with Eric, Neil's friend.

01:00:33.622 --> 01:00:37.080
But it's becoming clearer
and clearer that he <i>...</i>

01:00:37.225 --> 01:00:41.594
Neil that is, is a
key figure in all this.

01:00:41.730 --> 01:00:44.255
Like he was there with me
the night it all happened.

01:00:49.337 --> 01:00:50.326
I can't.

01:00:50.872 --> 01:00:51.839
I can't.

01:00:52.007 --> 01:00:53.167
Don't. No.

01:00:54.442 --> 01:00:55.875
I can't.

01:00:56.011 --> 01:00:56.909
It's okay.

01:00:57.779 --> 01:00:59.644
No. No.
Don't.

01:01:00.015 --> 01:01:00.845
It'll feel good.

01:01:00.982 --> 01:01:01.778
Don't!

01:01:04.519 --> 01:01:05.508
I'm sorry.

01:01:05.654 --> 01:01:06.814
You better go.

01:01:08.556 --> 01:01:09.386
Please.

01:01:10.225 --> 01:01:11.283
I'm sorry, Brian.

01:01:27.242 --> 01:01:29.676
I'll pay 120.
Not a cent more.

01:01:31.379 --> 01:01:32.209
Okay.

01:01:33.214 --> 01:01:34.078
Shall we?

01:02:21.062 --> 01:02:21.687
Fuck me!

01:02:23.131 --> 01:02:25.793
Fuck me up the ass with
your hot, teenaged cock!

01:02:31.773 --> 01:02:32.705
Wait!

01:02:32.874 --> 01:02:34.273
What the fuck are you doing?

01:02:42.951 --> 01:02:44.179
Okay.
Whatever.

01:02:47.288 --> 01:02:48.414
I'll put it on for you.

01:02:54.529 --> 01:02:55.655
There.

01:03:00.235 --> 01:03:02.533
Well, come on, stud.
We're on the clock here.

01:03:36.104 --> 01:03:38.265
<i>We're not in Kansas</i>
<i>anymore, Neil.</i>

01:03:38.439 --> 01:03:40.873
You have got to
be so careful.

01:03:42.744 --> 01:03:43.540
I know.

01:03:44.245 --> 01:03:46.406
Don'<i>t</i>"I know <i>"</i> me,
Neil McCormick.

01:03:46.548 --> 01:03:48.778
This is New York City.

01:03:48.917 --> 01:03:52.114
You do the wrong thing with
the wrong person and you die.

01:03:52.253 --> 01:03:54.551
Period.
End of story.

01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:00.590
Just promise me
you'll be safe.

01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:03.526
Okay.

01:04:06.067 --> 01:04:06.965
Here.

01:04:12.707 --> 01:04:15.938

♪ <i>And me, I am your dagger.</i> ♪

01:04:30.859 --> 01:04:33.157
Are these the only kinds

01:04:35.263 --> 01:04:37.163
Why? You don't like it?

01:04:37.298 --> 01:04:39.163
No, it's cool.

01:04:41.903 --> 01:04:44.599
So, has Neil gotten
back to you yet?

01:04:47.175 --> 01:04:50.576
Let me explain The
Universe of Neil McCormick.

01:04:50.745 --> 01:04:53.680
He's like a planet,
Saturn say.

01:04:53.815 --> 01:04:57.216
And we're all like little
moons orbiting around.

01:04:57.352 --> 01:04:59.820
Now, do planets
write letters?

01:05:01.723 --> 01:05:04.487
But I do know that he'll be
in Hutchinson for Christmas.

01:05:04.626 --> 01:05:05.593
What?

01:05:05.727 --> 01:05:07.422
His mom told me that she sent
him a ticket to fly home <i>...</i>

01:05:07.562 --> 01:05:09.496
for Baby Jesus's Birthday.

01:05:09.631 --> 01:05:11.599
So I'll introduce you then.

01:05:11.733 --> 01:05:12.927
<i>Brian?</i>

01:05:15.336 --> 01:05:16.428
Yeah?

01:05:16.604 --> 01:05:19.767
Thought you two might
like a little study break.

01:05:19.941 --> 01:05:21.101
Thanks, Mrs. Lackey.

01:05:21.276 --> 01:05:22.607
Thanks, Mom.

01:05:25.446 --> 01:05:26.777
It's 11:30.

01:05:29.317 --> 01:05:30.875
If it's Avalyn <i>...</i>

01:05:31.019 --> 01:05:33.214
tell her I'm not here.

01:05:36.057 --> 01:05:37.081
Hello?

01:05:37.225 --> 01:05:40.752
No, I'm sorry, Avalyn,
he's out with his friends.

01:05:40.895 --> 01:05:41.884
<i>No problem.</i>

01:05:42.030 --> 01:05:44.157
I thought you
kinda liked her.

01:05:44.299 --> 01:05:46.859
I just <i>...</i>
I don't know.

01:05:48.503 --> 01:05:51.233
I think I just need a little
space from her right now.

01:05:51.406 --> 01:05:53.704
I always thought she
was a freak anyway.

01:05:53.841 --> 01:05:55.832
So, I'm off to bed.

01:05:56.010 --> 01:05:56.942
Good night, boys.

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:19.758
Hello.

01:06:22.236 --> 01:06:26.696
I'm a.<i>..</i> I'm Zeke.
From LA.

01:06:26.874 --> 01:06:28.068
Neil.

01:06:32.347 --> 01:06:33.473
Neil.

01:06:33.614 --> 01:06:37.482
What are you doing
in New York City?

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:50.119
That's a <i>...</i>
that's a Vermeer.

01:06:50.264 --> 01:06:55.668
Well, it's sort of a Vermeer.

01:07:45.653 --> 01:07:47.211
You are exquisite.

01:07:54.262 --> 01:07:56.355
I guess it's my turn, huh?

01:08:27.627 --> 01:08:31.894
Hope these don't
frighten you too much.

01:08:32.033 --> 01:08:39.337
They <i>...</i> have a habit of popping up
in the most inopportune places.

01:08:48.616 --> 01:08:52.313
Oh, I know.
Don't be worried.

01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:57.413
This is gonna be the safest
encounter you ever had.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.729
If you could
just rub my back.

01:09:08.903 --> 01:09:12.895
Really, I need to be touched.

01:09:34.462 --> 01:09:38.330
Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes.

01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:40.559
Oh, make me happy.

01:09:40.701 --> 01:09:43.636
Make me happy,
make me happy <i>...</i>

01:09:57.084 --> 01:10:00.349
Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes.

01:10:11.132 --> 01:10:13.828
Oh, make me happy.

01:10:39.694 --> 01:10:42.288
You were 100
percent safe, right?

01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:43.727
Yeah.

01:10:43.864 --> 01:10:45.229
I told you I just jerked off.

01:10:45.366 --> 01:10:47.425
He watched from
across the room.

01:10:47.568 --> 01:10:50.799
For the first time in my
life I'm bothered by it.

01:10:53.174 --> 01:10:59.170
Maybe you should try and find
some other safer way to make money.

01:10:59.313 --> 01:11:02.043
You k now,
like every one else.

01:11:06.721 --> 01:11:08.188
Yeah, maybe.

01:11:21.102 --> 01:11:22.729
You're the only
one I've ever told.

01:11:25.339 --> 01:11:26.499
I know.

01:11:26.674 --> 01:11:30.440
I never told Eric,
or my Mom.

01:11:30.578 --> 01:11:32.375
And I know some people
might think it's fucked up,

01:11:32.513 --> 01:11:34.504
or terrible, or whatever?

01:11:35.616 --> 01:11:40.883
But what happened that
summer <i>...</i> is a huge part of me.

01:11:41.022 --> 01:11:45.049
No one ever made me feel
that way, before or since.

01:11:46.927 --> 01:11:51.489
Like I was, I was special.

01:11:51.632 --> 01:11:55.966
Neil.<i>..</i> you were 8 years old.

01:11:57.471 --> 01:11:58.904
Yeah, but he really loved me.

01:12:03.477 --> 01:12:06.537
I mean there were other
kids sometimes, but <i>...</i>

01:12:06.681 --> 01:12:09.206
I was his prize.

01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:16.355
I was his one true love.

01:12:35.476 --> 01:12:37.034
Happy birthday.

01:12:37.211 --> 01:12:39.645
You didn't have to
get me anything.

01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:41.805
It's just a little
something I picked out.

01:12:48.556 --> 01:12:49.386
Wow.

01:12:51.459 --> 01:12:52.448
Cool.

01:12:52.593 --> 01:12:54.458
I thought it'd go great
with your hair colour.

01:12:54.595 --> 01:12:56.495
It's so cool.

01:12:58.099 --> 01:12:58.997
Thanks.

01:13:08.976 --> 01:13:09.806
You alright?

01:13:12.446 --> 01:13:13.538
I'm drunk.

01:13:16.717 --> 01:13:18.776
I've never been
drunk in my life!

01:13:18.919 --> 01:13:21.114
I'm corrupting you.

01:13:21.255 --> 01:13:22.187
At last!

01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:29.461
Hey.
That's pretty good.

01:13:29.597 --> 01:13:30.894
Yeah, sure.

01:13:31.031 --> 01:13:33.090
No, really.

01:13:33.234 --> 01:13:36.203
You have definite
artistic talent, my boy.

01:13:38.472 --> 01:13:39.564
What?

01:13:40.808 --> 01:13:43.470
That's an interesting touch.

01:13:45.279 --> 01:13:48.680
So, what's the <i>"</i> deep meaning <i>"</i>
behind the baseball cleats?

01:13:51.552 --> 01:13:53.315
I have no idea.

01:14:06.567 --> 01:14:07.226
Boo.

01:14:13.741 --> 01:14:16.335
- How was work?
- Fuckin' boring.

01:14:18.379 --> 01:14:20.347
- You need a hand?
- Sure.

01:14:25.853 --> 01:14:28.413
So, I've got news for you.

01:14:28.556 --> 01:14:30.922
Hey, me too.

01:14:31.058 --> 01:14:32.958
Okay.
You first.

01:14:33.093 --> 01:14:35.027
Look what my Mom
sent me today.

01:14:35.162 --> 01:14:37.187
She wants me to come
home for Christmas.

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:41.691
Your mom is the coolest.

01:14:41.836 --> 01:14:44.031
Like mine would
ever do that for me.

01:14:44.171 --> 01:14:45.069
It's weird.

01:14:45.206 --> 01:14:47.868
I hate Hutchinson
more than anything but <i>...</i>

01:14:48.008 --> 01:14:50.272
But I'm kind of looking
forward to going back <i>...</i>

01:14:50.444 --> 01:14:52.878
just for a short visit.

01:14:53.047 --> 01:14:55.481
- Plus you get to see Eric.
- Yeah.

01:14:57.985 --> 01:14:59.043
So what's your news?

01:15:01.388 --> 01:15:03.822
I think I found you a job.

01:15:03.958 --> 01:15:05.516
A what?

01:15:05.659 --> 01:15:08.787
I was talking to this friend
at work, Rachel, about you.

01:15:08.929 --> 01:15:12.456
It's only minimum wage at a
stupid sandwich place, but <i>...</i>

01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:17.362
What?

01:15:17.505 --> 01:15:18.870
You're not into it.
Whatever.

01:15:19.006 --> 01:15:19.938
It's cool.

01:15:20.074 --> 01:15:21.507
No, no, tell me
more about it.

01:15:24.345 --> 01:15:25.039
Really?

01:15:25.212 --> 01:15:27.442
Yeah, really?
I want to hear more about it.

01:15:27.581 --> 01:15:29.208
- You do?
- Yeah.

01:15:43.964 --> 01:15:46.194
You sure you're
gonna be okay?

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:49.063
I'm just glad my
Mom's working late.

01:15:53.974 --> 01:15:55.942
Thanks for everything.

01:15:56.110 --> 01:16:00.638
This has been.<i>..</i> the
best birthday ever.

01:16:03.150 --> 01:16:04.174
You're welcome.

01:16:09.523 --> 01:16:11.115
Oh shit.

01:16:11.258 --> 01:16:13.988
- Who's that?
- It's my Dad.

01:16:23.103 --> 01:16:24.661
Dad?

01:16:24.805 --> 01:16:28.605
Son.
I caught you.

01:16:28.776 --> 01:16:31.745
Your Mother said she didn't
know whether you'd be home or not.

01:16:31.912 --> 01:16:33.846
Happy Birthday.

01:16:35.316 --> 01:16:37.181
What are you doing here?

01:16:37.318 --> 01:16:40.082
I'm not allowed to wish my
only son a happy birthday?

01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:43.986
Dad, I haven't seen
you for what, 2 years?

01:16:44.124 --> 01:16:46.354
Well, maybe if you returned
my calls once in a while <i>...</i>

01:16:46.493 --> 01:16:49.860
Maybe I don't want to return
your phone calls, Dad.

01:16:49.997 --> 01:16:52.431
Maybe I just want you
to leave me alone.

01:16:52.566 --> 01:16:54.295
Brian, don't be like this.

01:16:54.435 --> 01:16:55.834
I drove all this way.

01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:57.403
I just wanted to see
how you're doing?

01:16:57.538 --> 01:16:59.335
Well, let me tell you
what I want to know.

01:16:59.473 --> 01:17:01.839
Something happened to
me when I was little.

01:17:02.009 --> 01:17:04.603
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

01:17:04.778 --> 01:17:06.177
What happened to me
that night I woke up <i>...</i>

01:17:06.313 --> 01:17:07.610
bleeding in the cellar?

01:17:07.748 --> 01:17:09.511
Where were you that night?

01:17:09.650 --> 01:17:13.051
God, I can tell you
don't even remember!

01:17:13.187 --> 01:17:14.279
You're drunk.

01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:16.082
Quit avoiding the subject!

01:17:16.223 --> 01:17:18.748
I was bleeding,
I kept passing out!

01:17:18.892 --> 01:17:21.952
I wet my fucking bed
and you never asked why!

01:17:22.096 --> 01:17:25.031
And what about that Halloween
when I blacked out again?

01:17:25.165 --> 01:17:27.292
Something happened to
me both those nights!

01:17:27.434 --> 01:17:28.662
What do you know about it?

01:17:28.802 --> 01:17:29.791
Tell me!

01:17:32.573 --> 01:17:33.733
I'm sorry, Brian, I <i>...</i>

01:17:35.743 --> 01:17:37.005
I can't help you.

01:18:23.257 --> 01:18:24.986
Welcome to Subz.
May I help you?

01:18:27.461 --> 01:18:28.257
<i>Brian?</i>

01:18:29.897 --> 01:18:30.864
Deborah!

01:18:34.435 --> 01:18:37.302
- Redecorating?
- Sort of, yeah.

01:18:39.673 --> 01:18:41.334
So how ya been, Bri?

01:18:41.475 --> 01:18:43.466
Good.
How's Berkeley?

01:18:43.644 --> 01:18:44.668
Hold on, you two.

01:18:44.845 --> 01:18:46.642
Why don't we continue this
conversation in the front room <i>...</i>

01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:49.078
over the peanut-butter peach pie
I baked for this occasion?

01:18:50.818 --> 01:18:52.410
Good to see you,
little brother.

01:18:52.553 --> 01:18:53.577
You too.

01:19:21.248 --> 01:19:22.078
Need a lift?

01:19:26.286 --> 01:19:27.116
Sure.

01:19:31.959 --> 01:19:33.017
Where we going?

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:35.754
My place.
Don't worry, I'll pay.

01:19:43.337 --> 01:19:46.431
- It's Christmas Eve tomorrow.
- No more talking.

01:20:09.062 --> 01:20:11.189
- Where are we?
- Brighton Beach.

01:20:37.057 --> 01:20:38.422
Bedroom's this way.

01:20:56.443 --> 01:20:57.375
Do it.

01:21:04.651 --> 01:21:05.845
Again.

01:21:18.632 --> 01:21:19.599
Strip.

01:21:36.783 --> 01:21:38.808
Open wide and suck it, slut.

01:21:41.121 --> 01:21:42.918
What are you
waiting for, slut?

01:21:46.593 --> 01:21:47.525
Suck it!

01:21:49.329 --> 01:21:52.127
You like that,
don't you, slut?

01:21:52.266 --> 01:21:53.995
Take it deep.

01:21:57.070 --> 01:21:58.094
Moan for me.

01:21:58.906 --> 01:22:00.203
Wait, wait.

01:22:05.078 --> 01:22:07.171
Slut knows what's
coming next.

01:22:07.347 --> 01:22:09.281
I'm gonna give the slut just
what he's begging for <i>...</i>

01:22:09.449 --> 01:22:10.006
Wait, wait, wait.

01:22:10.183 --> 01:22:11.309
There's some
things I don't do.

01:22:11.451 --> 01:22:12.975
Wait.
I gotta take a piss.

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.519
Hold on.
I'll be right back.

01:22:37.244 --> 01:22:40.213
You're getting fucked, slut,
whether you like it or not.

01:22:44.651 --> 01:22:45.515
Slut!

01:22:48.355 --> 01:22:53.258
Slut! Slut! Slut!
Slut! Slut! Slut!

01:23:01.335 --> 01:23:02.768
God, you love it!

01:23:02.903 --> 01:23:05.929
Take that cock all
the way up there.

01:23:06.073 --> 01:23:08.564
Take it, slut.

01:23:08.742 --> 01:23:10.369
Yeah. Yeah!

01:23:12.446 --> 01:23:13.538
Are you ready?

01:23:13.714 --> 01:23:14.681
Here it comes.

01:23:14.848 --> 01:23:15.644
Are you ready?

01:23:15.782 --> 01:23:17.511
You ready? Ready?

01:23:41.274 --> 01:23:42.172
Mom.

01:26:13.527 --> 01:26:14.994
Today is the day.

01:26:26.373 --> 01:26:28.273
Brian!
Now where are you off to?

01:26:28.408 --> 01:26:29.875
I'm going out with Eric.

01:26:30.043 --> 01:26:32.034
You don't want to stay and
talk with your sister awhile?

01:26:32.212 --> 01:26:33.611
I'll be back soon.

01:26:33.747 --> 01:26:35.044
Don't be late, young man.

01:26:35.182 --> 01:26:36.877
Christmas Eve dinner's at 6 sharp.

01:26:37.017 --> 01:26:37.813
Okay.

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:47.549
Here we are.

01:26:48.762 --> 01:26:50.195
Do I look okay?

01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:51.922
Okay's a relative term.

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.758
I'm kidding.
You look fine.

01:26:54.901 --> 01:26:56.334
Excited?

01:26:56.469 --> 01:26:58.164
Yes.

01:26:58.305 --> 01:26:59.795
And nervous.

01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:01.532
Don't worry.

01:27:01.675 --> 01:27:03.666
I'm sure you guys
will hit it off great.

01:27:03.843 --> 01:27:05.003
I hope you're right.

01:27:12.152 --> 01:27:13.050
Ellen?

01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:14.052
Ellen?

01:27:17.624 --> 01:27:18.682
Oh, hi, Eric.

01:27:18.825 --> 01:27:20.417
Hey, Mrs. M.
Merry Christmas.

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:22.551
You remember Brian.

01:27:23.230 --> 01:27:24.595
Of course I do.

01:27:24.731 --> 01:27:25.493
Hi, Brian.

01:27:25.632 --> 01:27:26.826
Merry Christmas.

01:27:26.967 --> 01:27:28.491
So where's the
Man of the Hour?

01:27:28.635 --> 01:27:30.262
I was going to call you.

01:27:30.403 --> 01:27:32.633
Why?
What happened?

01:27:32.772 --> 01:27:35.502
There's been an accident.

01:27:35.675 --> 01:27:41.204
Neil, he got mugged on
the way to the airport.

01:27:41.381 --> 01:27:43.315
Is he okay?

01:27:43.483 --> 01:27:47.351
He's going to be fine.
He's asleep in his room.

01:27:49.723 --> 01:27:51.987
Well, maybe we should
come back tomorrow.

01:27:52.125 --> 01:27:53.558
Maybe.

01:27:53.693 --> 01:27:55.718
Or you stay if you'd like,
have some cookies <i>...</i>

01:27:55.862 --> 01:27:57.352
and we'll see if he's <i>...</i>

01:28:01.534 --> 01:28:02.501
Honey, you're up.

01:28:05.005 --> 01:28:06.472
The fuck you staring at, Preston?

01:28:09.476 --> 01:28:11.603
Brian says that you both were
in Little League together.

01:28:12.412 --> 01:28:13.276
Mm-hmm.

01:28:15.148 --> 01:28:17.616
So how long has it been since
you two last saw each other?

01:28:19.386 --> 01:28:21.251
10 years.

01:28:21.388 --> 01:28:24.585
5 months and.<i>..</i> 7 days.

01:28:26.059 --> 01:28:28.459
Well, you must have a lot
of catching up to do.

01:28:31.665 --> 01:28:34.429
Turn right off Main
by the fairgrounds.

01:28:34.567 --> 01:28:36.228
So what the fuck happened?

01:28:36.369 --> 01:28:38.200
It's a long story.
I'll tell you later.

01:28:38.338 --> 01:28:39.771
Just drive for now.

01:28:39.906 --> 01:28:42.773
It's nice to see New York hasn't
hardened you one bit, McCormick.

01:28:48.014 --> 01:28:50.744
So you're the legendary Brian.

01:28:53.119 --> 01:28:54.882
We have a lot in
common, don't we?

01:28:56.089 --> 01:28:57.317
I think so.

01:29:08.368 --> 01:29:09.733
Make a left at the
next stop sign.

01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:15.135
Is this starting
to look familiar?

01:29:21.614 --> 01:29:22.706
Pick us up in a half hour.

01:29:25.151 --> 01:29:26.049
Okay.

01:29:39.933 --> 01:29:40.797
You ready?

01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:55.513
Blue.

01:30:07.327 --> 01:30:09.591
No one's home.
Let's go around back.

01:30:14.601 --> 01:30:15.932
We have to get in.

01:30:18.805 --> 01:30:19.931
I know a way, here.

01:30:27.747 --> 01:30:28.736
Voila.

01:30:28.915 --> 01:30:32.146
You were the best player
on the team, weren't you?

01:30:32.285 --> 01:30:33.912
That's what he
always told me.

01:30:46.232 --> 01:30:47.164
Help.

01:30:59.479 --> 01:31:01.811
This was his bedroom.

01:31:01.948 --> 01:31:05.384
At least the ceiling's
still the same.

01:31:05.552 --> 01:31:09.488
I used to get lost for hours
staring at all the patterns.

01:31:09.622 --> 01:31:12.785
Whirls, speckly,
sparkly things.

01:31:15.595 --> 01:31:16.653
Come on.

01:31:28.007 --> 01:31:30.168
Oh, man.
What's up with these people?

01:31:30.343 --> 01:31:32.470
He used to keep
these things stocked.

01:31:46.059 --> 01:31:47.549
This is it, right?

01:31:57.604 --> 01:32:02.337
So, why now?
Why did you search me out?

01:32:05.712 --> 01:32:07.976
I'm tired of it.

01:32:08.114 --> 01:32:10.480
I want to dream about
something else for a change.

01:32:27.233 --> 01:32:28.894
"Away in a Manger <i>."</i>

01:32:30.236 --> 01:32:34.195
It took till I actually laid
eyes on you today to remember you.

01:32:36.009 --> 01:32:39.240
When Eric wrote me about you,
I could only get the vaguest,

01:32:39.412 --> 01:32:41.107
hazy picture in my head.

01:32:41.281 --> 01:32:42.976
Like a staticky TV.

01:32:44.050 --> 01:32:45.017
Same here.

01:32:46.819 --> 01:32:51.153
But seeing you here
in this room <i>...</i>

01:32:51.291 --> 01:32:54.021
I feel like he's
watching us right now.

01:32:57.830 --> 01:33:00.560
I have no idea what
happened to him.

01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:03.396
After that summer,
he just disappeared.

01:33:03.536 --> 01:33:06.061
I don't even know if
he's alive or what.

01:33:06.205 --> 01:33:09.436
Maybe it's his ghost
that's watching us.

01:33:09.609 --> 01:33:11.543
Tell me everything you can.

01:33:18.918 --> 01:33:20.442
Well, I was his favourite.

01:33:22.689 --> 01:33:24.418
Out of every one,
he picked me.

01:33:26.893 --> 01:33:28.952
I know that sounds
kind of weird, but,

01:33:29.095 --> 01:33:30.687
when it first
started happening <i>...</i>

01:33:33.032 --> 01:33:35.262
I felt honoured.

01:33:35.401 --> 01:33:36.732
Go on.

01:33:40.573 --> 01:33:43.371
I don't know, this is
where the big TV was,

01:33:43.543 --> 01:33:45.773
all the cool video games.

01:33:45.945 --> 01:33:47.708
That's the kitchen.

01:33:47.847 --> 01:33:51.010
The first time,
it happened there.

01:33:55.755 --> 01:33:59.691
It lasted that whole summer.
Just me and him.

01:34:01.127 --> 01:34:03.755
I saw him one other time.

01:34:03.896 --> 01:34:07.491
On Halloween, a
couple years later.

01:34:07.634 --> 01:34:09.932
I was lost.

01:34:10.069 --> 01:34:12.037
He said my name.

01:34:12.872 --> 01:34:13.964
<i>Brian?</i>

01:34:15.341 --> 01:34:16.535
<i>Brian?</i>

01:34:21.347 --> 01:34:22.905
I thought that was you.

01:34:25.818 --> 01:34:28.309
<i>The game had just started.</i>

01:34:28.454 --> 01:34:31.355
<i>I was sitting on</i>
<i>the bench as always.</i>

01:34:31.491 --> 01:34:33.652
<i>It started to rain...</i>

01:34:33.793 --> 01:34:37.160
<i>Sprinkles at first,</i>
<i>then a downpour.</i>

01:34:39.432 --> 01:34:40.729
<i>The ump called the game.</i>

01:34:42.402 --> 01:34:44.165
And no one came
to pick you up.

01:34:44.303 --> 01:34:48.865
My Mom was working
and my Dad, who knows?

01:34:49.008 --> 01:34:51.704
<i>Every one else drove</i>
<i>off with their parents.</i>

01:34:51.878 --> 01:34:54.346
<i>I was left there all alone.</i>

01:34:54.514 --> 01:34:57.847
<i>Then you were in the dugout</i>
<i>with me and you said...</i>

01:34:57.984 --> 01:34:59.815
We'll take you home.

01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:07.016
And we got in Coach's
stationwagon, remember?

01:35:12.598 --> 01:35:13.690
He brought us here.

01:35:17.003 --> 01:35:17.833
It's all right, Brian.

01:35:17.970 --> 01:35:19.494
We're just going to have
a little bit of fun.

01:35:24.077 --> 01:35:27.376
<i>And he didn't want you in the</i>
<i>bedroom because that was just for</i>
<i>us.</i>

01:35:27.513 --> 01:35:31.916
So it all happened
here, in this room.

01:35:32.085 --> 01:35:34.485
Keep going.

01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:37.111
Don't stop until you've
told me everything.

01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:41.859
Anytime there was
another boy involved,

01:35:41.994 --> 01:35:43.552
it was always the same.

01:35:43.696 --> 01:35:46.665
Coach used me as a
prop to pull you in.

01:35:46.799 --> 01:35:50.064
He'd take off my clothes
and it was up to me <i>...</i>

01:35:50.203 --> 01:35:54.367
to make it seem like fun, like this
is a really cool game we were playing.

01:35:54.507 --> 01:35:55.974
Go ahead, show him, Neil.

01:35:56.109 --> 01:35:57.576
All right, here
are the rules.

01:35:57.744 --> 01:36:00.338
First I kiss you,
then you kiss me back,

01:36:00.513 --> 01:36:01.844
then it's his turn.

01:36:04.617 --> 01:36:05.948
Are you ready?

01:36:08.721 --> 01:36:10.018
Here we go.

01:36:13.092 --> 01:36:15.253
My God!

01:36:15.394 --> 01:36:17.487
You want me to stop?

01:36:25.404 --> 01:36:28.567
So I put my tongue
in your mouth,

01:36:28.708 --> 01:36:31.768
getting it all wet and shiny.

01:36:31.944 --> 01:36:33.434
Then it was his turn.

01:36:35.782 --> 01:36:37.409
Watching his big lips
sucking your face,

01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:40.747
I remember thinking, "oh, he's
going to swallow his head whole <i>".</i>

01:36:44.690 --> 01:36:50.356
So we took off your clothes
and you made this <i>...</i>

01:36:50.496 --> 01:36:54.762
whimpering puppy sound
that Coach always loved.

01:36:57.069 --> 01:37:00.232
Coach and me had this thing
where he would open up his mouth,

01:37:00.373 --> 01:37:04.935
and wrap it around my dick and balls
and everything all at once.

01:37:05.111 --> 01:37:07.272
He did that to me.

01:37:07.446 --> 01:37:10.074
Then I tried to do it to you
but couldn't because <i>...</i>

01:37:10.216 --> 01:37:11.979
my mouth was too small.

01:37:16.489 --> 01:37:18.320
Then <i>...</i>

01:37:18.457 --> 01:37:20.288
he went down on you.

01:37:22.762 --> 01:37:25.322
For what seemed like
a really long time.

01:37:26.299 --> 01:37:28.893
<i>Your eyes were closed mostly,</i>
<i>but every now and then...</i>

01:37:29.035 --> 01:37:35.406
<i>they would flutter open, and just</i>
<i>had this glassy, faraway look.</i>

01:37:35.541 --> 01:37:40.535
And then I leaned
in and whispered.

01:37:40.713 --> 01:37:44.240
It's fun, right?
Tell him you think it's fun.

01:37:56.929 --> 01:37:58.191
We're almost finished.

01:37:59.832 --> 01:38:01.231
You're gonna be able?

01:38:01.367 --> 01:38:02.891
Yeah.

01:38:06.205 --> 01:38:09.003
Then we played
the 5 dollar game.

01:38:09.141 --> 01:38:14.340
When Coach would ask me to
do things, crazy sex things.

01:38:14.513 --> 01:38:16.674
<i>And if I could do them,</i>
<i>he'd give me a 5 dollar bill.</i>

01:38:16.816 --> 01:38:19.717
It's okay.
Go ahead, Neil.

01:38:30.296 --> 01:38:33.857
He made us fist him.
Do you know what that is?

01:38:40.439 --> 01:38:43.135
I went first, of course.

01:38:43.309 --> 01:38:48.144
And on that night, the 5 dollars
was mine if I could ram <i>...</i>

01:38:48.281 --> 01:38:54.481
my little fist up his ass and
wring it all the way to the elbow.

01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:57.350
<i>And goddamn it, I did it.</i>

01:38:57.490 --> 01:38:59.424
<i>I'll never forget</i>
<i>how it felt.</i>

01:38:59.558 --> 01:39:03.221
<i>It felt like his whole body</i>
<i>was trying to suck me into it.</i>

01:39:03.362 --> 01:39:04.454
Devour me.

01:39:07.566 --> 01:39:09.124
And then I did it too.

01:39:17.276 --> 01:39:22.111
And then we drove you back to Little
River
and left you in your driveway.

01:39:22.281 --> 01:39:23.373
The End.

01:39:27.954 --> 01:39:29.649
And my nose was bleeding.

01:39:32.558 --> 01:39:33.752
How did that happen?

01:39:45.738 --> 01:39:49.834
When it was over and we
were getting you dressed,

01:39:50.009 --> 01:39:55.345
your face looked like
you'd been erased.

01:39:55.481 --> 01:39:58.143
Like you were
just empty inside.

01:39:58.284 --> 01:40:00.013
And you just fell.

01:40:00.152 --> 01:40:01.642
Face first on the floor.
Bam.

01:40:03.289 --> 01:40:06.190
<i>And when we pulled you up,</i>
<i>your nose was bleeding.</i>

01:40:06.325 --> 01:40:07.383
Like this?

01:40:11.130 --> 01:40:12.154
Like this?!

01:40:12.298 --> 01:40:14.732
Shh. Stop. Stop. Stop.

01:40:26.479 --> 01:40:27.605
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:29.213
<i>No one's even home.</i>

01:40:29.382 --> 01:40:30.872
<i>No, someone's there.</i>

01:40:31.050 --> 01:40:32.347
<i>I can see them.</i>

01:40:34.286 --> 01:40:35.753
<i>Look, I see them, too.</i>

01:40:35.888 --> 01:40:37.719
<i>What's going on?</i>

01:40:37.857 --> 01:40:40.121
<i>I think that</i>
<i>someone's in there.</i>

01:40:48.134 --> 01:40:52.969
♪ <i>Silent night.</i> ♪

01:40:53.105 --> 01:40:59.340
♪ <i>Holy night.</i> ♪

01:40:59.512 --> 01:41:05.417
♪ <i>All is calm.</i> ♪

01:41:05.551 --> 01:41:11.251
♪ <i>All is bright.</i> ♪

01:41:12.324 --> 01:41:14.918
<i>And as we sat there</i>
<i>listening to the carollers,</i>

01:41:15.061 --> 01:41:19.191
<i>I wanted to tell Brian it was over</i>
<i>now and everything would be okay.</i>

01:41:19.331 --> 01:41:22.596
<i>But that was a lie, plus,</i>
<i>I couldn't speak anyway.</i>

01:41:24.904 --> 01:41:27.805
<i>I wish there was some way for</i>
<i>us to go back and undo the past.</i>

01:41:30.242 --> 01:41:31.436
<i>But there wasn't.</i>

01:41:32.945 --> 01:41:35.880
<i>There was nothing</i>
<i>we could do.</i>

01:41:36.048 --> 01:41:40.815
<i>So I just stayed silent and trying</i>
<i>to telepathically communicate...</i>

01:41:40.953 --> 01:41:43.319
<i>how sorry I was</i>
<i>about what had happened.</i>

01:41:46.125 --> 01:41:47.820
<i>And I thought of all</i>
<i>the grief and sadness...</i>

01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:49.552
<i>and fucked up suffering in the</i>
<i>world...</i>

01:41:49.695 --> 01:41:53.495
<i>and it made me</i>
<i>want to escape.</i>

01:41:53.632 --> 01:41:54.929
<i>I wished with all my heart</i>
<i>that we could just...</i>

01:41:55.067 --> 01:41:58.195
<i>leave this world behind.</i>

01:41:58.337 --> 01:42:02.967
<i>Rise like two angels in</i>
<i>the night and magically...</i>

01:42:03.142 --> 01:42:04.473
<i>disappear.</i>
