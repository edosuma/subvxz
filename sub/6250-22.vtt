WEBVTT

00:06.841 --> 00:08.957
Geez. The poor guy
was only 50.

00:09.051 --> 00:10.962
They say cause ofdeath
was cardiac failure...

00:11.053 --> 00:13.339
resulting from
a congenital defect.

00:13.431 --> 00:16.639
-You’re not gonna talk like that
when we get there, right?
-Like what?

00:16.726 --> 00:19.468
It’s a wake, Bones.
It’s not a crime scene. You know.

00:19.562 --> 00:22.645
“/ ’m sorry for your loss. ”
“How are you hold/n ’ up .7” S tuﬁ‘ like that.

00:22.732 --> 00:25.189
I know. I just don’t agree
with the social convention...

00:25.276 --> 00:28.643
which requires us to attend
a day-long grieving ritual...

00:28.738 --> 00:31.024
simply because the deceased
worked at theJeffersonian.

00:31.115 --> 00:33.652
Try not to say “the deceased.”

00:33.743 --> 00:36.655
But it’s not like any of us actually knew
this Dr. Reilly personally.

00:36.746 --> 00:39.738
I knew him. It was Hank.
Hank was a prince.

00:39.832 --> 00:44.041
/ talked to him just last wee/r
about Michel/e—
how to get her to stop smoking.

00:44.128 --> 00:47.370
- She’s smoking?
What, she’s smoking what?
- Cigarettes.

00:47.465 --> 00:50.923
I’ve been her legal guardian
for a month, and I’m already
a total failure.

00:51.010 --> 00:53.717
She’s 16. She’sjust tryin’
to test you. That’s all.

00:53.804 --> 00:56.466
- Maybe we should just focus on Hank.
- Oh, I think I remember him.

00:56.557 --> 01:00.766
- Uh, curly, blond hair, blue eyes, glasses—
- Nope. Dark hair, balding.

01:00.853 --> 01:03.344
You don’t even work at theJeffersonian.
How do you know him?

01:03.481 --> 01:06.348
The guy ran the best
fantasy football league in DC.
Oh, man. Oh, man.

01:06.484 --> 01:09.226
I still owe him 20 bucks.
Come to think about it,
you know what?

01:09.320 --> 01:13.984
He owed me 20 bucks.
Great. How am I gonna
get that now?

01:17.078 --> 01:20.286
[Chattering]

01:20.373 --> 01:23.490
[ Chatter/77g Continues, tow]

01:28.005 --> 01:32.795
There are a lot of people here
whom I recognize.
Well, they’re from work, honey.

01:32.885 --> 01:35.547
[ Hodgins]
There’s Amy Valeska.
That’s Hank’s assistant.

01:35.638 --> 01:38.004
[Saroyan ]
0/7, she looks really upset

01:38.099 --> 01:40.636
Grief can be very difficult to process.
So ifanyone needs to talk—

01:40.726 --> 01:44.093
- That’s why they have booze, Sweets.
- Right.

01:44.188 --> 01:48.648
Hank’s mother 0 ver there
is my rich— something to 0’0
with 073/ cleaning.

01:48.734 --> 01:51.942
- Dr. Temperance Brennan?
- Yes. Hello.

01:52.029 --> 01:56.614
Hank said you worked
at the museum, but I didn’t
think you’d be here.

01:56.701 --> 01:59.363
- I-I’m Barney, Hank’s brother.
- [Whispering]
“I’m sorry for your loss.”

01:59.495 --> 02:01.907
Uh, I’m sorry
for your loss.
Yeah.

02:01.998 --> 02:05.035
I’m an author—
a writer, like you.

02:05.126 --> 02:09.369
I mean, |-| write thrillers.
I’ve read all ofyours.

02:09.463 --> 02:12.796
Ladies and gentlemen,
after you take a moment
with the deceased

02:12.883 --> 02:15.670
pleasejoin us
in the family room for
refreshments and reminiscences.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.215
[Chﬂeﬂy]
Yeah.
[Angda]Soundsgood.

02:28.566 --> 02:31.433
Sorry, Hank,

02:31.527 --> 02:33.734
but she’s still smoking.

02:41.454 --> 02:43.445
[Sighs]

02:47.043 --> 02:49.034
[Sighs]

03:17.656 --> 03:19.942
[Gasps]

03:26.248 --> 03:30.116
[Whispering]
Go up. Pay your respects.
I know.

04:00.116 --> 04:02.027
[Continues Whispering]
Okay, Bones, you really suck at this.

04:02.118 --> 04:05.326
You are staring way too long
at this guy, okay?

04:05.413 --> 04:07.529
People are gonna start thinking
you have a thing for him.

04:07.665 --> 04:10.702
[Whispering]
This man was murdered.
Heart attack.

04:10.793 --> 04:12.249
No.
He had a heart attack.

04:12.336 --> 04:14.167
No. Booth,
this man was murdered.

04:14.255 --> 04:17.793
Hank Reilly did not die
from congenital heart failure.

04:17.883 --> 04:19.839
He was murdered.

04:58.007 --> 04:59.998
[Chattering]

05:02.511 --> 05:04.968
What is that?
This is whiskey.

05:05.055 --> 05:07.922
Well, it’s a wake,
Bones, okay?
There’s drinking involved.

05:08.058 --> 05:11.846
We should remain clearheaded
so we can solve the murder.
[Clears Throat]

05:11.979 --> 05:14.220
Code word, okay, for murder?
Okay.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.772
I want you to say “translation.”
You understand?

05:16.901 --> 05:18.437
[Whispers]
“Translation.”
Okay.

05:18.569 --> 05:22.778
Got it?
Someone translated Dr. Reilly,
and we have to find out who.

05:22.865 --> 05:25.982
Bones, is there any chance
youjust feel bad...

05:26.076 --> 05:29.318
about not knowing this guy
like the rest of us did,

05:29.413 --> 05:31.574
so now you’rejust makin’ it
about you and saying...

05:31.707 --> 05:33.618
that he was translated instead of—
Mmm.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.620
I don’t know— dying of natural causes?

05:35.711 --> 05:37.702
No. There is no chance ofthat.

05:39.882 --> 05:42.498
What makes you think he was... translated?
Okay.

05:42.593 --> 05:46.177
The rose that his assistant placed
on his chest had fallen to the side.

05:46.305 --> 05:50.093
So I reached in to put it back,
and I touched him.
Whoa. You touched him? Ah!

05:50.226 --> 05:52.467
Ah, geez!
I touch dead people
all the time, Booth.

05:52.603 --> 05:57.723
Well, I felt cracked ribs: Left 2, 3, 4.
Drink up, will you?

05:57.858 --> 05:59.769
Why?
’Cause I’m hoping
you’re gonna pass out.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.727
Booth, we are talking about translation.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.312
Bones, did you ever think that,
uh— oh, I don’t know—

06:05.407 --> 06:08.365
ifthere was evidence
of foul translation,

06:08.452 --> 06:10.443
that the coroner
would’ve spotted it?

06:10.579 --> 06:12.820
Yes.
Fine. So I’ll tell you what.
Tomorrow morning,

06:12.915 --> 06:15.873
we will go find the guy who did the autopsy,
and we’ll ask him questions.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.871
No. Mmm, Booth. Booth,
Dr. Reilly is scheduled...

06:17.962 --> 06:20.044
to be cremated this afternoon.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.631
All ofthe evidence
will be destroyed.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.216
We have to get
an injunction...

06:23.300 --> 06:24.881
so that we can examine
the remains.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.387
Now. You want me to take the body now?
Yes.

06:27.471 --> 06:29.883
That family will be
scarred for life.

06:29.974 --> 06:31.965
Booth, the man has
been translated.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.970
[Groans]

06:34.061 --> 06:37.098
Okay, fine. Fine, fine, fine.
Triple-fine, all right?

06:37.231 --> 06:40.268
I’ll call for an injunction.
In the meantime—
Okay.

06:40.401 --> 06:43.985
go into the family room there
where they’re doing toasts.
Okay.

06:44.071 --> 06:48.986
All right. There you go. Bones? Put on a sad face.

06:50.327 --> 06:54.536
No, sad. Keep that face sad. That’s it. That’s it.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.365
[Booth Sighs]

06:58.502 --> 07:00.413
[Woman]
//oved—
[Cell Phone Beeps]

07:00.504 --> 07:03.917
Hank Reilly.

07:04.008 --> 07:06.420
I still love him!

07:06.510 --> 07:09.798
And why not? He was...

07:11.473 --> 07:14.010
a good husband.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.183
A good man.

07:16.270 --> 07:20.889
The little things
are What life ’5 about—
the routine.

07:20.983 --> 07:23.474
Hank said
I should ground Michelle.

07:23.569 --> 07:27.278
But I don’t want to be
the enemy. She’s only been
with me for a month, you know?

07:27.364 --> 07:30.822
- Really? Now?
- [ Gasps Quietly] Right.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.651
Eve/y morning,
/ brewed his tea for him,

07:33.746 --> 07:36.032
steeped just the amount
he liked it.

07:36.123 --> 07:39.081
What am / gonna do now—
[Inhales Deeply]

07:39.168 --> 07:42.410
in the mornings... without Hank?

07:42.504 --> 07:46.372
- [Sobbing]
- [Man] Is she okay?

07:46.467 --> 07:48.423
I—I’mjonah Amayo.

07:48.510 --> 07:51.297
Hank and / started at the jeﬁ‘ersonian
at the same time.

07:51.388 --> 07:56.724
He was head of Egyptology.
//ead the Caribbean department

07:56.810 --> 07:58.926
Bones, what are you doing?
Will you stop playing
with the body?

07:59.063 --> 08:02.180
Did you get the injunction?
No. Thejudge
turned us down.

08:02.316 --> 08:05.353
Why?
Why? Because both the paramedics
and the medical examiner...

08:05.444 --> 08:07.605
said that Reilly here died of heart failure.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.607
No evidence oftranslation.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.440
- But I am contradicting them.
My record and credentials—
- Okay, look.

08:12.534 --> 08:17.198
Thejudge said he didn’t want to grant
a request to an author of pulp mystery books...

08:17.289 --> 08:19.280
just because she wanted
to get a little free publicity.

08:19.375 --> 08:24.495
- There, I said it.
- That man is a fool. They are not pulp.

08:24.588 --> 08:28.172
At least he was right about, you know,
the paramedics and the medical examiner.

08:28.258 --> 08:31.716
/ will get the judge the proof he needs.
/ust guard the door.

08:31.845 --> 08:35.463
Get away from the body.
Get away from the body.
[Saroyan ] Guard the door

08:35.557 --> 08:37.422
From what?

08:41.438 --> 08:43.895
- You undressed the deceased?
- No. /didn’t have to.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.769
/t was slit up the back
Ijust had to untuck him.

08:51.198 --> 08:54.486
Huh. There was no mention
ofthis contusion...

08:54.576 --> 08:56.487
in the medical examiner’s report.

08:56.578 --> 08:59.320
- Meaning?
- This bruise was sustained later.

08:59.415 --> 09:02.077
Corpses don’t bruise.
Whoa, wait.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.249
So Hank was alive
after he was declared dead?

09:04.336 --> 09:07.169
Sure looks that way.

09:07.256 --> 09:10.544
Where did the body go
after the medical examiner?

09:10.634 --> 09:13.296
The funeral home
for embalming.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.140
[Brennan]
We should talk
to the funeral director.

09:21.186 --> 09:23.302
[ Woman Moan/ng]

09:26.358 --> 09:29.475
Hello?
You mind?

09:33.449 --> 09:35.565
Booth, Booth.
What?

09:35.701 --> 09:38.283
What?
The— The widow
and the undertaker.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.986
What, they were dancing?
What?

09:41.123 --> 09:43.034
Sexual intercourse.
Oh—
[Scoffs]

09:43.125 --> 09:45.366
How am I supposed to get
“sexual intercourse”
from that?

09:45.502 --> 09:47.413
It’s very obvious.
Oh, is it? No.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.540
- This is obvious.
- This is my house now,

09:49.673 --> 09:53.165
and I can do...
who I want in it.
Obviously.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.751
Okay.
There you go.

09:55.888 --> 09:59.597
So, uh, you do this stuffa lot?
It’s myjob
to comfort the bereaved.

09:59.683 --> 10:02.516
Well, it is also your duty to...

10:02.603 --> 10:05.891
report any damage
the body sustained
during your preparation of it.

10:07.024 --> 10:10.937
When did you take that?
You molested the body?

10:11.069 --> 10:13.776
[Brennan]
No.
F.B.l.

10:13.864 --> 10:17.277
- WOW. F.B.l.?
- You wanna explain how
the bruises got on that body?

10:17.367 --> 10:21.235
The infusion ofembalming fluid
increases the stainability
of bruises on the dermis.

10:21.330 --> 10:24.822
A bruise not seen
immediately postmortem often
presents itself post-embalmin g.

10:24.958 --> 10:28.075
Okay. Is that good enough for you?
What about the rib breaks?

10:28.170 --> 10:31.412
Rib breaks and sternum cracks—
which I noted in his file—

10:31.507 --> 10:33.418
were the result
of Dr. Reilly’s assistant...

10:33.509 --> 10:37.252
attempting to revive him
with C.P.R. after finding him
unconscious in his office.

10:37.346 --> 10:39.803
Mayl go?
I have more work to do.

10:39.890 --> 10:44.054
Right. Right.
Sure, you have to go take care
of his mother now too?

10:45.062 --> 10:46.973
So, you still think
he was translated?

10:47.064 --> 10:49.396
Well, those are not
the ribs that would break
during C.P.R.

10:49.525 --> 10:53.939
Well, maybe she wasjust bad
at resuscitation.
No. Booth, this is translation.

10:54.071 --> 10:57.484
We need to do a full examination
ofthe body at the lab.
[Sighs]

10:57.574 --> 11:00.031
But we do not have an injunction!

11:00.118 --> 11:04.862
This is a sad day for all of us.

11:04.957 --> 11:06.868
But I think it’s important
that we remember...

11:06.959 --> 11:09.951
what we loved about Hank,
you know?

11:10.045 --> 11:12.832
His sense ofhumor,
of course.

11:12.923 --> 11:16.632
He was always
quick with a joke,
good or bad.

11:16.718 --> 11:20.256
- Usually bad.
- [Guests Chuck/e]

11:20.347 --> 11:22.383
But he—

11:25.936 --> 11:27.927
Oh, my God.

11:28.021 --> 11:33.266
Uh—h-h—oh, my God, Hank.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.272
Ah—
[ Chuck/es ]
Hank is—

11:36.363 --> 11:39.480
Hank-Hank is—
He’s leaving... us.

11:39.575 --> 11:43.864
Where is he going from here?
[ I/oice Cracks]
Who knows? Um,

11:43.954 --> 11:47.071
but, uh— uh—
[ Mutters ]

11:47.165 --> 11:49.326
- [ Glass Shatters ]
- [Guests Gasp ]

11:49.418 --> 11:53.627
Ah-oh-h-h, Go-o-od, uh, Hank.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.877
It’s not ﬂair, you know?

11:56.967 --> 12:00.004
You live life.
And we— we-we die.

12:00.095 --> 12:03.929
And we don ’t—
we don’t love enough.

12:04.016 --> 12:08.976
And— And I-I-I’m— I’m gonna...
not do that anymore.

12:09.062 --> 12:14.682
’Cause /’m— /— /—
/ need to live and— and.. love.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.812
And—

12:19.573 --> 12:21.859
[Sighs, Chuckles]

12:26.413 --> 12:28.324
Thank you.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.497
[Guests Murmur/ng ]

12:30.584 --> 12:32.540
Hey, come on. Slide ’im.
Hurry up, Bones.

12:32.669 --> 12:35.160
Why are you telling me
to hurry up?
Walk with him, okay?

12:35.255 --> 12:38.167
Your Sequoia was, uh—
it was blocked,
so I grabbed Angela’s Matrix.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.507
Is there enough room?
It’ll be fine.
There’s lots of room.

12:40.594 --> 12:43.336
Here we go. In the car.
Let mejust get this stiff in here.

12:43.472 --> 12:46.714
Shouldn’t we lie him down?
No, no. You get stopped,
you got a dead corpse.

12:46.808 --> 12:51.347
This way, hejust looks drunk. Okay.
One, two, three. Get the legs in. There we go.

12:51.438 --> 12:55.681
Grab the seat belt. Plug him in.
Oh, watch his— Watch the—

12:55.776 --> 12:58.859
- Strap him in there, Bones.
- He looks comfy.

12:58.946 --> 13:01.312
- You got him? All right. See you later.
- [Saroyan ] Great.

13:01.406 --> 13:04.364
- Aren’t you coming with us?
- No. I gotta make sure no one looks in the casket.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.818
Okay? Go. Go, go, go, go, go. Go. Drive.
Go! What are you wait/n ’ for? Go!

13:10.040 --> 13:11.871
Go.
Go, go.

13:13.794 --> 13:16.661
[Thuds]

13:20.592 --> 13:22.628
[Sighs]
Ay.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.256
[Guests Chattering]

13:29.351 --> 13:30.761
Hey.
Hmm.

13:30.894 --> 13:34.227
Hey, wh-what’s goin’ on?
[Clears Throat]
What— What do you mean?

13:34.314 --> 13:36.896
Your toast?
The word “loony”
comes to mind.

13:37.025 --> 13:42.019
I was... moved and,
you know, um, emotional.
Mm-hmm.

13:42.114 --> 13:46.323
- Tell me what’s going on,jack.
- I thought his toast was wonderful.

13:46.410 --> 13:50.028
See? | wasjust wonderful.
That’s all.

13:50.122 --> 13:54.081
We don’t love each
other enough In this world
A t least we don ’t say it enough.

13:54.209 --> 13:57.201
You spoke from the heart.
They should really make
an announcement...

13:57.295 --> 13:59.877
about this whiskey
being 150 proof.

13:59.965 --> 14:02.877
Amy, you were
Dr. Reilly’s intern, right?

14:02.968 --> 14:04.879
Graduate assistant, yes.

14:04.970 --> 14:07.632
It must’ve been awful
when you found him lying
on the office floor.

14:07.723 --> 14:10.590
- Hodgins!
- Was he complaining ofchest pains?

14:10.684 --> 14:15.428
- Hodgins, what are you—
possessed by Brennan?
- He was fine all morning.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.888
When he left for lunch,
I said, “Have a nice lunch.”

14:17.983 --> 14:19.848
And he said,
“Thank you. You too.”

14:19.985 --> 14:22.101
And I said—
So... you didn’t go
to lunch together.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.106
No, no.
He had a lunch meeting.

14:24.197 --> 14:28.110
Sushi. I hate sushi.
I heard that the mercury
in raw fish can make you stupid.

14:28.243 --> 14:31.531
Mmm.
Mmm.Yeah. Uh,who was
his lunch meeting with?

14:31.621 --> 14:34.988
He wouldn’t say.
I yelled for help, called 911...

14:35.083 --> 14:37.460
and tried to get him
breathing again
until the paramedics—

14:37.544 --> 14:40.752
Oh.
Ok-Okay. Okay.

14:40.839 --> 14:43.797
[Amy Sobbing]

14:46.261 --> 14:48.377
[No Audible Dialogue]

14:48.472 --> 14:51.635
- Okay. All right.
- [Amy] Thank you.

14:51.767 --> 14:53.678
Mm-hmm.
I’m gonna go freshen up now.

14:53.769 --> 14:56.135
[ Quietly]
Okay.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.185
Mm-hmm.

14:58.273 --> 15:02.858
Okay. Booth just told me Brennan
thinks Hank was murdered,

15:02.944 --> 15:04.900
so he helped her steal the body...

15:04.988 --> 15:08.651
so Cam could take it back to
thejeffersonian to have a look.

15:09.785 --> 15:12.777
Hey. You stole the body?
No, no, no, no, no.

15:12.871 --> 15:15.328
We didn’t steal it.
You see, we—
we borrowed it, okay?

15:15.415 --> 15:17.997
Cam and Bones think
he was translated.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.287
Uh, wh-what?
“Translated.”

15:20.378 --> 15:23.962
It’s code for “murder.”
That’s how we’re saying it
today: “translated.”

15:24.091 --> 15:28.425
Ok-Okay. What if somebody
looks in the coffin?
That’s exactly why I’m here.

15:28.512 --> 15:31.549
- [Coughs]
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Reilly.

15:31.640 --> 15:35.553
Uh, would you
excuse me, please? I—

15:35.644 --> 15:39.887
I have a few private things
to say to my son
before he’s cremated.

15:39.981 --> 15:43.815
That’s, uh, really not
a great idea right now, ma’am.

15:43.902 --> 15:47.645
- Why?
- Well, there’s a—

15:50.367 --> 15:54.451
The-The fact is, um,
the undertaker—
Mm-hmm.

15:54.538 --> 15:58.030
Uh, he didn’t graduate
at the top of his class,
so—

15:58.125 --> 16:00.332
But I just saw Hank earlier.

16:00.418 --> 16:04.127
Yes. Yes, you did.
Um, but the, um—

16:04.214 --> 16:09.675
the putty that they used
to... fill in the face
has sort of... melted.

16:09.761 --> 16:14.175
And, um, his nose is sort of...
going to the side.

16:14.307 --> 16:18.641
[Gasps, Inhales]
Um, and his hair... is like Hitler.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.389
- Hitler.
- Hitler?

16:20.522 --> 16:23.104
H m m.
t isten.
/ rea/lv th/nk it would be best...

16:23.191 --> 16:26.683
ifyou let Mr. Tung fix him up
before you see your son.

16:26.778 --> 16:29.815
- There you are.
- Oh, turn around, Barney.

16:29.906 --> 16:33.273
- We can’t see Hank— not like this.
- Like what?

16:33.368 --> 16:36.405
- Like Hitler.
- What?

16:37.497 --> 16:39.909
Please.
We’re going... now.

16:42.085 --> 16:44.872
- Mothel; have you been dr/nking?
- [Mother] No.

16:44.963 --> 16:48.330
[Brennan]
These fractures were definitely
not caused by CRR.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.541
The breaks are more randomly located...

16:50.635 --> 16:54.219
and suggest a sharper impact
than a hard push.

16:54.306 --> 16:59.050
Yes, he was stabbed.
You can see the entry wounds
hidden behind the trocar buttons—

16:59.144 --> 17:03.183
thirteen in total—
each one sealing up
a cutaneous puncture site,

17:03.273 --> 17:06.515
each one caused by a weapon
three eighths ofan inch
in diameter—

17:06.610 --> 17:09.226
most likely... this.

17:09.321 --> 17:11.687
Standard medical trocar,
used in arterial embalming.

17:11.781 --> 17:14.443
Could it just be
a poor job of embalming.?

17:14.534 --> 17:17.025
Impossible.
Over half ofthese
are nowhere near a vein.

17:17.120 --> 17:20.738
Hank was stabbed
seven times with a trocar
while he was still alive.

17:20.832 --> 17:23.323
So Hank Reilly had a heart attack,

17:23.418 --> 17:26.455
was declared dead by the paramedics
and the medical examiner,

17:26.546 --> 17:28.457
and then sent to an undertaker—

17:28.548 --> 17:30.459
Where he was stabbed to death.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.673
[Booth]
See, what we have here,
Frank/in, is a real-time...

17:36.765 --> 17:39.381
video link to theJeffersonian
forensic lab, huh?

17:39.476 --> 17:42.013
- So, say hi.
- Hello.

17:42.145 --> 17:45.854
I’m Dr. Camille Saroyan.
I’m not sure we met.
That’s Mr. Reilly.

17:45.941 --> 17:48.273
Why did you hide
all these stab wounds?

17:48.360 --> 17:51.102
It’s myjob to make the body presentable.
I did myjob.

17:51.238 --> 17:53.695
I did myjob. I did myjob!
Okay, look.

17:53.782 --> 17:57.821
- Mr. Tung, what we need to know
is who stabbed Hank Reilly.
- I did.

17:58.995 --> 18:01.407
- It was me.
- You stabbed the corpse?

18:01.498 --> 18:05.867
It’s crazy. This whole thing
is totally crazy. Maybe I’m crazy.

18:05.961 --> 18:08.498
I did acid in high school,
and that’s probably why I’m not a doctor.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.751
Okay, listen. M—Just relax.
Just tell me what happened, okay?

18:11.841 --> 18:16.084
It was late.
Everyone had gone home,
and the body had just come in.

18:16.179 --> 18:18.966
/ had cleaned and disinfected him
and was about to administer...

18:19.057 --> 18:22.549
the pre-In/ect/on to ﬂush his veins
before /began the a/ter/a/ emba/m/ng.

18:22.644 --> 18:25.226
I went in through
the right femoral artery.

18:25.313 --> 18:28.055
Then suddenly— wham!

18:28.149 --> 18:32.188
His eyes open.
His bodyjerks up and spasms.

18:32.279 --> 18:35.271
- You panicked and stabbed him?
- It was a reﬂex. I—

18:35.365 --> 18:38.573
Have you seen those zombie movies?
They can really warp you.

18:38.660 --> 18:41.151
Okay.
You watch zombie movies on acid.

18:41.246 --> 18:43.282
I was scared.
[Saroyan]
/ get it.

18:43.373 --> 18:47.491
Sometimes I’m here in the middle ofthe night,
and I swear I see one ofthese bodies move.

18:50.213 --> 18:54.126
Let me... just say I totally get that.

18:54.217 --> 18:57.880
Okay, guys, listen. Was—
Was Hank Reilly dead or alive?

18:57.971 --> 19:01.589
It wasn’t a full autopsy— no need,
because he was declared dead by the hospital.

19:01.683 --> 19:04.174
Cause seemed reasonable,
so the M.E.just signed offon it.

19:04.269 --> 19:06.601
- Can I go?
- No, you can’t go. Listen, Cam.

19:06.688 --> 19:09.896
How is it that a guy
can appear dead to two sets
of medical professionals?

19:09.983 --> 19:13.020
There are several
forms of paralysis
which mimic death.

19:13.111 --> 19:16.854
Embalming would’ve destroyed any trace
of paralytic toxins in his system.

19:16.948 --> 19:18.939
Except—

19:28.335 --> 19:31.077
A trace amount ofthe toxin...

19:31.171 --> 19:33.708
may still be found
in the vitreous humor ofthe eye.

19:43.933 --> 19:46.720
All right. Let’s go.
You can go now.
Come on. Out.

19:48.897 --> 19:51.604
Vitreous humor tests positive
for tetrodotoxin—

19:51.691 --> 19:56.230
100 times more lethal
than potassium cyanide,
naturally occurring.

19:56.321 --> 19:58.232
- But he wasn’t dead.
- Yet.

19:58.323 --> 20:01.190
That occurs anywhere
from 20 minutes to eight hours
after ingestion.

20:01.284 --> 20:05.197
Until then,
heart and respiratory rates
mimic death.

20:05.288 --> 20:09.577
Tung hits a nerve while tapping the femoral.
Reilly bolts up, still in a coma—

20:09.667 --> 20:11.578
And Franklin Tung
stabs and kills him.

20:11.669 --> 20:14.411
But somebody else
poisoned him first.

20:21.179 --> 20:23.761
Hank Re/l/y was in a paralytic state
mimicking death...

20:23.848 --> 20:26.225
when Frank/in Tung
inserted the trocar,

20:26.309 --> 20:28.595
causing Hank Reilly
to spasm in such a way...

20:28.686 --> 20:31.223
that he actually
sat up on the embalming table.

20:31.314 --> 20:34.181
Ah! So technically,
Franklin Tung committed manslaughter,

20:34.275 --> 20:35.856
while somebody else
committed attempted murder.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.775
- What did you find at the lab?
- “Tetris hydrogen.”

20:37.862 --> 20:39.272
- Tetrodotoxin.
- That’s what I said.

20:39.364 --> 20:43.107
Tetrodo toxin does ha ve limited
medical uses as a treatment
for some card/ac arrhythm/as.

20:43.201 --> 20:45.192
Hank had a congenital
heart condition.

20:45.328 --> 20:47.865
So is this “tetrahockalin”
thing common?
[ Both] Tetrodotoxin.

20:47.956 --> 20:51.073
- That’s what I said!
- It’s a— It’s a controlled substance.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.909
Wait. Angela,
maybe you could access
the F.D.C. database,

20:54.003 --> 20:55.959
see if Hank
was ever prescribed
tetrodotoxin.

20:56.047 --> 20:59.460
- I need a computer.
- Use mine. Come on. In the car.
Come on, come on, come on.

20:59.551 --> 21:03.965
Ifanybody comes in here,
do not let them look in that casket.
Do you understand? All right?

21:04.055 --> 21:05.761
[Door Closes]

21:05.890 --> 21:09.599
So, while I’m here, mind ifl
erase a few parking tickets?
[Computer Beeping]

21:09.686 --> 21:13.725
No, I’ll tell you what.
I’m not gonna relax until we get
Hank’s body back in that casket.

21:13.815 --> 21:15.680
Here’s something.
What?

21:15.817 --> 21:17.773
[Beeps]
Three milligrams
of tetrodotoxin...

21:17.861 --> 21:20.022
was delivered to theJeffersonian
three weeks ago.

21:20.113 --> 21:23.856
Wait a second.
Hank had his heart medicine
delivered to work?

21:23.950 --> 21:25.861
Oh, no,
it wasn’t Hank.

21:25.952 --> 21:30.195
Delivery was accepted by Dr.Jonah Amayo
in Caribbean studies.

21:33.918 --> 21:39.129
Oh! Dr. Amayo, I’d like you
to meet my associate,
Seeley Booth.

21:39.215 --> 21:41.206
I’m aware. The two ofyou
are fairly well known.

21:41.301 --> 21:43.337
R/ght. Dr. Brennan tells me
the jefferson/an...

21:43.428 --> 21:45.885
is shutting down your department
after this quarter.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.963
I’m sure you’ve heard of
this thing called the economy,

21:48.057 --> 21:49.718
which is in another thing
called the toilet.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.596
You were going to have
to report to Hank Reilly.

21:52.687 --> 21:55.429
Until he died and everything
went back to normal.

21:55.523 --> 21:59.766
You think I’m happy Hank died?
He was my best friend.

21:59.861 --> 22:02.523
Why did you order
three milligrams
of tetrodotoxin?

22:02.614 --> 22:05.981
- Why are you interrogating me?
- I work with the FBI. See, that’s what I do.

22:06.075 --> 22:09.238
- Hey, where have you guys been?
- Not now, Sweets. Please.
[ Murmurs]

22:09.329 --> 22:12.071
Your ﬁeld is
the anthropological study
of Caribbean culture.

22:12.207 --> 22:16.541
How does a class one neurotoxin
assist with that?
[Sweets] 0h, / got it!

22:16.628 --> 22:19.745
Uh, neurotoxins
are widely believed
to cause the trance state...

22:19.839 --> 22:21.750
in reported cases
of Haitian zombiism.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.173
Am I right? I’m right, right?

22:24.260 --> 22:26.000
Zombies?

22:26.095 --> 22:28.051
There are no such things as zombies.
Just an island superstition.

22:28.139 --> 22:31.677
And now you’ve managed
to insult an entire culture
and their belief system.

22:31.768 --> 22:36.979
- Oh, she does that to everyone.
- Dr. Amayo’s work in voodoo
and Santeria is fascinating—

22:37.065 --> 22:39.772
and a little scary.
[Chuckles]

22:39.859 --> 22:43.022
You-You people need to work
on your small-talk skills.

22:43.112 --> 22:45.023
Excuse me.

22:45.114 --> 22:47.696
Whoa.
What was that all about?

22:47.784 --> 22:49.320
Fugu.

22:50.411 --> 22:52.868
That’s really not very nice.

22:52.956 --> 22:57.450
Tetrodotoxin is biologically
derived from tetraodontidae—
puffer fish.

22:57.544 --> 23:01.332
- So, what?
- It’s a japanese delicacy known as fugu.

23:01.422 --> 23:05.381
Hank Reilly had sushi for lunch
at a place called Sushi Momo.

23:05.468 --> 23:07.629
King ofthe funeral.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.262
Right.

23:12.308 --> 23:14.219
[Grunts]
There.
[Handcuffs Ratchet]

23:14.310 --> 23:18.474
So, nobody looks inside the casket.
Okay, Mr. Tung?

23:18.565 --> 23:20.647
How do I do that?

23:20.733 --> 23:23.065
Just, um—

23:23.152 --> 23:25.689
Well, Bones,
how does he do that?

23:25.780 --> 23:30.740
Say someone enters and desires
to gaze upon the visage oftheir
dead relative one more time...

23:30.827 --> 23:34.240
in a vain effort to say
good-bye to someone who can
neither see nor hear them,

23:34.372 --> 23:37.205
because there ’5 no such
thing as a soul or spirit—
Bones,just— Bo-Bones.

23:37.292 --> 23:39.283
Just give him a reason
not to show the body.

23:39.377 --> 23:41.993
We are encountering
fluid seepage at the moment,

23:42.088 --> 23:45.672
and the body is not available
for viewingjust now.

23:45.800 --> 23:48.337
I would never
phrase it that way.
I know! It’s perfect!

23:48.469 --> 23:50.505
[ Cell Phone Rings]
It’s so gross.

23:50.597 --> 23:53.839
- Brennan.
- I’m done!

23:53.933 --> 23:56.470
I’m gonna need some transport
for me and my friend.

23:56.561 --> 23:59.928
- What friend?
- I meant Hank.
I was being oblique.

24:00.023 --> 24:02.560
Uh, right after we get back
from sushi.

24:02.692 --> 24:04.683
[Saroyan ]
Sushi? You’re going for sushi?
Whoa!

24:04.777 --> 24:07.234
[Line Disconnects]

24:07.363 --> 24:10.070
[Booth]
So do you serve puffer fish?
[Brennan] Fugu.

24:10.158 --> 24:12.274
Blowfish?
No. We’re unlicensed.

24:12.410 --> 24:15.823
We’re investigating
a tetrodotoxin poisoning.
Fugu.

24:15.913 --> 24:18.495
We do not serve fugu.
I promise.

24:18.583 --> 24:22.075
- Did someone die
who ate at my restaurant?
- Dr. Hank Reilly.

24:22.170 --> 24:25.128
Hank?
Hejust had lunch with us
the other day.

24:25.214 --> 24:27.956
Do you know who
he ate lunch with?
/t was a woman.

24:28.051 --> 24:30.758
She told him something,
and he got very upset.

24:30.887 --> 24:33.003
Tell us anything

Not really.

like Cleopatra.

Excuse me.
/ ’m, uh— I’m looking
for my fnén ds.

24:45.234 --> 24:48.146
I apologize,
but we are encountering some...

24:48.237 --> 24:50.694
slight fluid seepage
at the moment,

24:50.782 --> 24:54.366

available for viewingjust now.

Sir, /’m a trained
psychologist.

24:58.414 --> 25:00.871
You’re obviously
under a lot of strain.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.949
You might say that.

25:03.044 --> 25:06.502
You know,
dealing with griefand loss
every day can take its toll.

25:06.589 --> 25:08.750
You have no idea.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.878
In some cases, one might
even take responsibility
for the death—

25:11.969 --> 25:14.426
as ifit were
their own fault.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.889
Are you messing with me?
No. No, no.

25:17.975 --> 25:22.093
I’m-I’mjust saying I understand.
Human behavior can surprise us all.

25:22.188 --> 25:25.806
You might think that you have everything
under control, and then— boom!

25:25.900 --> 25:28.892
You’re blindsided
by the unknown.

25:28.986 --> 25:31.193
Totally.
[ Exhales]

to the deceased?

Yes. Yes, you are.

Nope.
The undertaker stabbed him.

Wait. The same undertaker that’s been
telling everyone that the body’s been leaking?
Mm-hmm.

26:27.879 --> 26:32.418

murder’s nothing to worry about.

go find Hodgins.
Bring him back to the lab.

Get the body and bring it
back into the casket
without anyone noticing it.

26:42.351 --> 26:44.933
Wait. What? Why?

26:45.021 --> 26:47.854
So that the poisoner doesn’t
figure out what we’re up to
and run away.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.352
- Duh.
- There’s a poisoner and a stabber?

26:50.443 --> 26:53.901

27:45.206 --> 27:48.414
You had lunch with Hank the day that he died.

27:48.501 --> 27:50.366
Must’ve been terrible.

27:50.461 --> 27:53.703
Yeah, it was terrible.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.297
It wasn’t
a very pleasant lunch.
Hmm.

27:56.425 --> 28:00.464
You guys argued?
Yeah. But, you know,
not personally.

28:00.555 --> 28:04.047

I can’t really discuss it.

28:04.141 --> 28:06.553
No, no.
Of course not.

But you do know that, uh,

in a situation like this.

28:12.108 --> 28:14.099
They don’t?
No.

Ifit wasjust business,
there’s nothing
to be guilty about.

28:18.406 --> 28:20.397

totally understand.

By the way,
Hank wasn’t killed by his lunch.

28:48.561 --> 28:51.018
What? Wait, it wasn’t
the fugu in his hand roll?
No.

28:51.105 --> 28:54.814
Toxins slowed his digestion,
and the remains
were well preserved...

28:54.901 --> 28:57.062
by the formaldehyde
and ethanol

28:57.153 --> 28:59.895
Tuna, salmon, yellowtail

28:59.989 --> 29:02.480
Really? What did he have
for breakfast?

29:02.575 --> 29:06.193
His wife said
Hank didn’t eat breakfast,
just the cup of tea.

29:06.287 --> 29:10.200
Well, I did find some stray tea leaves.
His strainer must not have worked very well.

29:10.291 --> 29:13.704
He still has a face.
He’s smiling—

29:13.836 --> 29:16.578
a bit too much maybe.

If there wasn ’t any s/gn of poison
in the food in his stomach...

29:23.095 --> 29:24.756
then it had to have come
from his morning tea.

37:10.312 --> 37:12.303
Well, at least we got
Frank/in Tung.

37:12.398 --> 37:16.016
Oh, he didn’t mean
to kill anyone. That’s the—
Cam? You here?

37:16.110 --> 37:18.101
What? I’m sorry.

37:20.364 --> 37:22.480
This smoking thing with Michelle—

37:22.574 --> 37:25.657
How do people be parents?

37:25.744 --> 37:29.453
Did you ever think that this is her way
oftrying to stop you from smoking?

37:29.540 --> 37:33.783
- No. Cam doesn’t smoke, right?
- You stop, she 7/ stop.

37:33.877 --> 37:36.710
It’s that simple. Plus, you know what?
She’s doing you a ﬂavor.

37:36.797 --> 37:38.753
Great.
Sol go from a smoking issue...

37:38.841 --> 37:41.958
to a “chocolate cake and ice cream” issue?

37:42.052 --> 37:45.920
You know what? You just—
You give it your best shot, and that’s all

37:46.056 --> 37:50.925
Nobody knows about the poison
in the tea except us, right?
The murderer does.

37:51.019 --> 37:54.011
When crops failed,
the ancient Pothigai in southern India...

37:54.106 --> 37:56.893
believed that one ofthem
might be possessed by an evil spirit.

37:56.984 --> 38:01.819
They would find out which one by passing around
a poison which would kill only demons.

38:01.905 --> 38:05.898
The person who refused to drink the poison
was proven possessed.

38:05.993 --> 38:08.154
Ah!

38:08.245 --> 38:11.829
Okay. Is this another way to get me
to quit smoking? Because it’s done.

38:11.915 --> 38:14.031
- I quit.
- You know what? You are a genius, Bones.

38:14.126 --> 38:16.538
Absolute genius!
I know.

38:25.721 --> 38:27.803
[Man]
And though the human remains
of Henry Reilly...

38:27.890 --> 38:29.801
will not physically rest here,

38:29.892 --> 38:33.976
his soul will remain
with the generations
ofhis family,

38:34.062 --> 38:36.348
here and in heaven.

38:36.440 --> 38:39.398
Oh, I’d like to add something.
I missed my chance at the wake.

38:39.526 --> 38:42.233
I’d like to make up for it.
No objections
from the family?

38:42.321 --> 38:46.860
Hank Reilly specialized in Egyptian
embalming rituals and practices.

38:46.950 --> 38:50.158
He was an expert in grieving.

38:50.245 --> 38:52.531
Hank would appreciate
nothing more...

38:52.623 --> 38:55.990
than the most common
of funerary practices—

38:56.084 --> 38:58.416
the raising ofa glass.

38:58.504 --> 39:02.622
- [Man] Okay.
- It’s not alcohol,
but an even more ancient drink—

39:02.716 --> 39:06.675
- tea— Hank’s greatest passion—
- [ Woman] Thank you.

39:06.762 --> 39:08.423
aside from sex.

39:08.514 --> 39:12.598
/ took the l/berty
of bring/ng this tea
from Hank’s personal stash.

39:12.684 --> 39:16.472
It’s the same tea he drank
on his last day with all of us.

39:16.563 --> 39:20.727
/ can th/nk of no better way
ofsaying adieu...

39:20.817 --> 39:24.275
than to share one last cup
of tea with Hank

39:27.950 --> 39:31.192
-To Hank.
-[Guests]To Hank.

39:31.286 --> 39:33.368
-To Hank.
-To Hank.

39:33.455 --> 39:35.741
- No!
- Mom. Watch what you ’re doini

39:37.709 --> 39:40.872
- You poisoned your own son?
- [Guests Murmuring]

39:41.004 --> 39:44.246
What?
Mom, what’s goin’ on?
He wasn’t my son.

39:44.341 --> 39:48.584
/t wasn ’t fair of your father.
He worked it so you got nothing.

39:48.679 --> 39:50.840
He got everything!

39:50.931 --> 39:53.798
- You killed Hank?
- [Man]
The old lady killed Hank?

39:55.060 --> 39:57.016
[Sobs]

39:57.104 --> 39:58.969
Oh, this is my fault.

39:59.106 --> 40:02.724
Oh, God.
This is why I hate funerals.
This is why I love them.

40:02.818 --> 40:06.686
/ told Hank that Annie
was ﬂying to get around
the will by s/phoning money...

40:06.780 --> 40:10.113
into a separate trust for Barney,
but it was illegal.

40:10.200 --> 40:14.819
Ifyou’d kept
your nosy trap shut,
Hank would still be alive!

40:15.914 --> 40:18.906
Bob, this is all your fault.

40:19.001 --> 40:21.538
You brought this on yourself

40:21.628 --> 40:23.869
Do what you’re going to do.

40:26.133 --> 40:28.715
What’s the worst
that could happen?

40:36.643 --> 40:40.101
[Barney]
Oh, Mom, Mom, Mom.

40:40.188 --> 40:44.227
One thing for sure, Barney.
Your mother loved you.

40:44.318 --> 40:48.937
She used her own heart medicine
to kill your brother so you
would get your fair share.

40:49.031 --> 40:51.147
She mixed it
in his tea.

40:51.241 --> 40:55.154
And she died because she ran out
of her medicine killing him.

40:55.245 --> 40:59.329
Oh, Ma.
I would’ve done fine.

41:00.375 --> 41:03.037
Hank, I didn’t want the money this way.

41:03.170 --> 41:07.254
I know you would’ve
done right by me. I know it.
[Whispers] Bones.

41:07.341 --> 41:10.424
Would you excuse me,
please?

41:10.510 --> 41:12.421
Of course.

41:14.598 --> 41:17.180
He wants to be alone
with his mother and brother.

41:17.267 --> 41:21.351
Well, by that way ofthinking,
he wants to be alone with
every person who has ever died.

41:21.480 --> 41:24.472
|f| die, I want you
to do me a favor.
Well, you will die.

41:24.608 --> 41:26.519
It’s inevitable.
All right, whatever, Bones.

41:26.610 --> 41:30.319
When I inevitably drop dead before you,
I’d like you to come out and, you know,

41:30.405 --> 41:32.862
spend some time
and talk to me every once in a while.

41:32.949 --> 41:35.736
Well, I’ll feel foolish
knowing that you can’t hear me.

41:35.827 --> 41:38.204
Promise me.

41:42.834 --> 41:46.452
- I promise.
- Hey, there you go! Huh?

41:46.546 --> 41:50.505
You agreed.
I didn’t think you would agree.
Now, why did you agree?

41:50.592 --> 41:55.177
I believe that if! pretended
you were still here,
I’d feel better fora moment.

41:55.263 --> 41:57.640
Also, speaking to you...

41:57.724 --> 42:01.637
would require me to figuratively
look at myselfthrough your eyes,

42:01.728 --> 42:04.310
again temporarily, and...

42:04.439 --> 42:08.853
I think that would make me
live my life more successfully.
[ Thunder Rumbling]

42:08.944 --> 42:14.689
Hmm. You know what, Bones?
That is the best thing that
anyone has ever said about me.

42:14.825 --> 42:17.783
I’ll say it at your wake.
Oh, it’s raining now. Come on.

42:17.869 --> 42:19.905
Get under the umbrella.
It’s raining.

42:20.038 --> 42:23.405
Just make sure when they
put me in the ground, I’m dead.
Yeah, no problem.

42:23.500 --> 42:26.913
All right? Maybe, you know,
leave my body out for a few hours...

42:27.003 --> 42:28.994
and check on me
every once in a while.

42:29.089 --> 42:31.796
No, I’d rather refrigerate you,
or else you’d start to smell.

43:06.877 --> 43:08.287
What’s that mean?
