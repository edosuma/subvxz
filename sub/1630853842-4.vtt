WEBVTT

00:28.069 --> 00:29.529
It has many names.

00:30.155 --> 00:34.576
Avernus, Tartarus, Hades,

00:34.659 --> 00:37.829
the infernal region you call Hell.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.374
So, Hell does exist?

00:42.375 --> 00:45.128
It does. For some.

00:45.795 --> 00:49.090
Does that mean it doesn't exist
if you don't believe in it?

00:51.051 --> 00:55.513
Did you believe in it?
When you were a man?

00:55.597 --> 00:56.514
Yeah.

00:57.098 --> 01:00.393
I just didn't expect Hell to be cold.

01:03.229 --> 01:05.648
So, which way do we go?

01:06.566 --> 01:08.443
I suggest we follow the damned.

01:14.240 --> 01:17.118
They make you
bring your own fire to Hell?

01:55.490 --> 01:56.658
Are you all right?

01:56.741 --> 01:57.951
I-I think so.

01:58.993 --> 02:01.329
-Here, let me help you.
-Thank you.

02:03.456 --> 02:04.624
I'm so sorry.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.543
It's my fault entirely.

02:07.252 --> 02:08.211
I…

02:08.294 --> 02:10.296
I lost my slippers somewhere.

02:10.380 --> 02:11.923
Oh. Here you go.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.967
Oh. You're very kind.

02:14.509 --> 02:17.345
I suppose I'm rather underdressed.

02:17.428 --> 02:20.723
Listen, if it were up to me,
I'd never get out of my pajamas.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.185
You live nearby? Or…

02:25.270 --> 02:26.479
No, I, uh…

02:29.190 --> 02:31.234
I've no idea where I am, actually.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.906
Can I… Do you need a ride somewhere?

02:36.990 --> 02:38.533
I'd be happy to take you.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.535
I'd hate to impose.

02:40.618 --> 02:42.495
You're not imposing at all. Honestly.

02:43.037 --> 02:43.872
Where are we headed?

02:43.955 --> 02:45.874
Do you where Mayhew is?

02:46.749 --> 02:50.086
It's on my way. I live in Cumberland.
I'm Rosemary.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.007
Hello, Rosemary. I'm John.

02:54.090 --> 02:55.258
Good to meet you, John.

02:56.050 --> 02:57.886
Come on, I'll introduce you to Susie.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.513
-Who's Susie?
-My Rottweiler.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.447
We're not sneaking in with them?

03:17.530 --> 03:20.950
A king may not enter
another monarch's realm uninvited.

03:22.035 --> 03:26.706
There are rules,
protocols which must be followed.

04:20.301 --> 04:22.095
There's one at the door.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.389
At the gate of damnation.

04:25.431 --> 04:29.102
Is it thief, thug or whore?

04:29.185 --> 04:30.603
There's one at the door.

04:31.312 --> 04:33.147
And there's room for one more.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.609
Till the end of creation.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.573
Greetings, Squatterbloat.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.744
I seek an audience with your sovereign.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.789
And who might you be?

04:49.872 --> 04:51.874
I am the King of Dreams.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.336
Ruler of the Nightmare Realms.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.463
Mm. Yes, my clown.

04:59.716 --> 05:00.967
So, where's your crown?

05:02.468 --> 05:04.345
Guard your tongue, demon.

05:05.388 --> 05:09.684
The Ruler of Hell will not be kind
to one who insults an honored guest.

05:09.767 --> 05:15.982
And I am a guest in this realm
as I am monarch of my own.

05:16.607 --> 05:18.026
So where's your ruby?

05:20.361 --> 05:22.280
Shall I use it to haunt your dreams?

05:23.656 --> 05:25.742
And your waking hours, too?

05:26.576 --> 05:30.663
Or will you open the gates of Hell
and let us through?

05:43.676 --> 05:47.263
Now, take us to the palace.

05:47.930 --> 05:49.807
There's one at the door.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.642
There's one at the door.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.686
There's one at the door.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.564
So, you live in Mayhew?

05:56.647 --> 05:57.774
Not anymore.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.777
My, uh… things are there.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.779
So you used to live in Mayhew?

06:02.862 --> 06:03.696
Uh…

06:04.614 --> 06:06.616
Yes. Few years ago.

06:08.868 --> 06:12.830
My mother's work forced us
to move around quite a bit.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.082
Mm. What does she do?

06:16.709 --> 06:18.836
Actually, she passed away quite recently.

06:19.796 --> 06:20.630
Oh, John…

06:20.713 --> 06:23.925
It's only just happened,
so I'm, I'm, I'm still a little bit--

06:24.008 --> 06:24.926
Of course.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.137
I'm so sorry, John.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.431
She wasn't a very good person, I'm afraid.

06:31.432 --> 06:34.394
That's an awful thing to say, isn't it?
Even if it's true.

06:37.021 --> 06:40.900
No. I have a mother like that, too.

06:40.983 --> 06:44.862
Really? What does she do?

06:44.946 --> 06:47.865
She watches cable news. All day.

06:48.449 --> 06:49.909
That's what she does.

06:50.952 --> 06:53.746
What about yours? When she was alive?

06:56.416 --> 06:57.792
When she was alive,

06:59.377 --> 07:02.213
my mother was a very successful thief.

07:04.298 --> 07:06.134
-Really?
-Yes, I'm afraid so.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.052
What did she steal?

07:08.928 --> 07:10.596
Is that rude? To ask? I'm sorry.

07:10.680 --> 07:11.681
No, not at all.

07:11.764 --> 07:14.100
Uh, she stole anything and everything.

07:14.183 --> 07:18.688
She stole art. She stole jewelry.
Other people's identities.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.898
Which is why we had
to keep moving all the time.

07:20.982 --> 07:23.359
It's why she lied about everything.

07:23.943 --> 07:24.819
Even to me.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.158
Well, maybe she was trying to protect you.

07:33.703 --> 07:37.081
Spoken like a woman
with children of her own.

07:37.165 --> 07:40.960
Two girls. Samantha, Sarah.

07:41.043 --> 07:41.919
Mm.

07:47.341 --> 07:49.594
Rosemary, may I ask you something?

07:49.677 --> 07:50.595
Of course.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.138
Do you lie?

07:53.598 --> 07:55.183
To Samantha and Sarah?

07:59.645 --> 08:02.607
Their dad was the liar in the family.

08:03.524 --> 08:05.776
We were married ten years

08:05.860 --> 08:10.615
before I found out he had another wife
and another kid in another town.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.617
-Oh, my goodness.
-Yeah.

08:15.036 --> 08:19.165
I think lying is maybe the worst thing
you can do to another person.

08:22.168 --> 08:23.878
I'm living proof of that.

08:26.297 --> 08:29.091
I'm sure your mom loved you
and was proud of you.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.136
She did forgive me in the end.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.931
-For what?
-Stealing from her.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.891
-What did you steal?
-A ruby.

08:38.059 --> 08:40.228
Unlike no other.
Like nothing you've ever seen.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.772
She had me arrested, of course.
And thrown in prison.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.107
-For stealing the ruby?
-And arson.

08:46.859 --> 08:47.902
And murder.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.239
General mayhem. Among other things.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.366
You see, the problem with having this ruby

08:53.449 --> 08:55.660
was that everyone was always trying
to take it from me.

08:55.743 --> 08:57.787
And so, I just did what I had to do.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.458
You murdered people?

09:02.542 --> 09:04.043
They weren't good people.

09:06.712 --> 09:10.132
Not like you and Susie.

09:10.841 --> 09:12.260
Isn't that right, Susie?

09:13.344 --> 09:17.139
Isn't that right, my sweet girl?

09:30.820 --> 09:32.071
Any idea where we are?

09:33.698 --> 09:37.159
The landscape is subject to
the whims of the Morningstar.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.078
The morning star?

09:39.161 --> 09:41.706
We have to spend the night
in this literally godforsaken--

09:41.789 --> 09:43.833
Lucifer Morningstar.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.294
As in the Devil?

09:46.377 --> 09:48.462
The Ruler of Hell is no mere devil.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.048
So, you two know each other?

09:51.132 --> 09:53.175
We've known each other
for a very long time.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.971
When we first met,
Lucifer was the angel Samael.

09:57.054 --> 09:59.849
I forgot the Devil used to be an angel.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.142
Not just any angel.

10:02.310 --> 10:06.606
The most beautiful, wisest,
and most powerful of all angels.

10:08.524 --> 10:13.195
Saving only the Creator, Lucifer is,
perhaps, the most powerful being there is.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.197
More powerful than you?

10:17.450 --> 10:20.077
By far. Especially now.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.579
Why now?

10:21.662 --> 10:23.956
The last time I was here,
I was an honored guest.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.125
An envoy from my own kingdom.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.836
This time, I have invited myself,

10:30.171 --> 10:32.173
and I lack my symbols of office.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.300
But you're still
Dream of The Endless, right?

10:34.383 --> 10:35.468
You got your sand.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.681
What's wrong?

10:40.765 --> 10:43.643
Squatterbloat. He's gone.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.186
All right, don't panic.

10:45.269 --> 10:47.313
I'm just gonna fly up
and see where we are.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.735
Nope, nope. Not doing that.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.167
This way.

11:16.384 --> 11:19.637
Does this seem like
the way to the palace to you?

11:20.638 --> 11:23.641
A demon has a hundred motives
for anything he does.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.185
All of them malevolent.

11:26.268 --> 11:27.186
Demon.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.357
This is not the way.

11:40.491 --> 11:41.409
Kai'ckul?

11:46.997 --> 11:48.082
Dream Lord?

11:54.255 --> 11:55.881
It is you.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.930
I greet you, Nada.

12:03.013 --> 12:04.056
Kai'ckul.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.394
How I have prayed for this day.

12:09.645 --> 12:11.355
I knew you would come.

12:13.315 --> 12:15.943
It pains me to see you like this.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.947
Then, free me, Lord.

12:21.323 --> 12:24.660
Only your forgiveness can free me.

12:28.956 --> 12:30.916
Do you not still love me?

12:32.168 --> 12:35.504
It has been 10,000 years, Nada.

12:41.093 --> 12:44.722
Yes. I still love you.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.769
But I have not yet forgiven you.

12:59.069 --> 13:00.112
Come, Matthew.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.909
Kai'ckul, I will not give up hope.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.621
I will never give up.

13:26.472 --> 13:30.768
Yes. I admit that in the past
I may have done some things

13:30.851 --> 13:36.524
that are morally… ambiguous.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.819
But it taught me about human nature

13:39.902 --> 13:42.988
and the secret
of real understanding and compassion.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.368
Do you want to know what it is?

13:48.911 --> 13:49.745
I do.

13:50.287 --> 13:52.832
This is going to sound rather odd,

13:52.915 --> 13:55.501
but the secret
to having compassion for people

13:55.584 --> 13:59.505
is knowing that
they are fundamentally selfish.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.007
And I say this without judgement.

14:02.091 --> 14:05.177
It's how human beings are built.
It's how we're made.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.887
But if you know that going in,

14:06.971 --> 14:09.640
if you understand that we are operating

14:09.723 --> 14:13.269
out of the biological
congenital selfishness,

14:13.352 --> 14:16.063
then life begins to make a lot more sense.

14:19.817 --> 14:20.901
Are you all right?

14:23.070 --> 14:25.406
Uh, sorry. The phone slipped.

14:28.868 --> 14:29.869
You were saying?

14:32.246 --> 14:34.832
I… I was saying,

14:34.915 --> 14:37.293
knowing that people are selfish

14:37.376 --> 14:42.673
sets you free from having to take
their actions, their lies, personally.

14:43.924 --> 14:47.052
People lie because they're selfish.

14:47.136 --> 14:50.180
They lie because they are human.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.642
They lie because they're scared.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.645
People will say anything.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.565
Do anything to keep from being hurt.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.154
That's what I think, anyway.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.952
You're very good, Rosemary.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.622
I don't know what you mean.

15:14.705 --> 15:19.752
I mean I experience people
as basically selfish

15:19.835 --> 15:22.588
and you experience them as afraid.

15:22.671 --> 15:25.466
Which they are, we all are.
You're absolutely right.

15:26.425 --> 15:27.384
And good.

15:30.512 --> 15:31.347
Thank you.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.146
Do you mind if we stop for gas?

15:41.482 --> 15:42.650
No, not at all.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.837
So, that woman back there.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.256
Anything you wanna share
with your friend Matthew?

16:11.637 --> 16:13.430
Her name is Nada.

16:15.391 --> 16:19.436
She was the ruler of a tribe
that call themselves the First People.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.066
We were in love.

16:24.984 --> 16:28.612
So what did she do? How'd she end up here?

16:29.697 --> 16:30.781
She defied me.

16:31.323 --> 16:34.034
Wait. You put her here?

16:34.743 --> 16:38.372
The Morningstar is letting me know
that Hell has prepared for my visit.

16:45.879 --> 16:47.089
Why are we stopping?

16:55.681 --> 16:56.682
We're here.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.148
Hello.

18:44.915 --> 18:45.874
Hello, Dream.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.336
Greetings to you, Lucifer Morningstar.

18:50.754 --> 18:52.506
And to you, Mazikeen of the Lillim.

18:54.424 --> 18:56.885
Greetings, Dream Lord.

18:58.512 --> 19:01.056
You look well, Dream. Are you well?

19:02.224 --> 19:07.479
And your family, Destiny, Death, Despair,
and the others?

19:09.439 --> 19:12.234
I presume the Ruler of Hell
knows this is no social call.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.528
Have you come to join forces then?

19:15.279 --> 19:17.698
To ally your realm to ours?

19:17.781 --> 19:20.242
To acknowledge the sovereignty of Hell?

19:20.909 --> 19:22.995
You know
my feelings on that, Lightbringer.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.122
Feelings change.

19:26.415 --> 19:31.336
Especially when one has been caught
and imprisoned by mortals.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.965
We expected better of you, sweet Morpheus.

19:35.048 --> 19:38.594
I have come because my Helm of State
was stolen from me.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.388
I believe one of your demons has it.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.432
I should like it back.

19:45.809 --> 19:46.643
Now.

19:47.269 --> 19:50.814
Dream, if only it were that easy.

19:51.398 --> 19:53.650
But there are rules, you see.

19:54.359 --> 19:57.070
Protocols which must be followed.

20:00.782 --> 20:02.576
Which demon has your helm?

20:02.659 --> 20:05.621
Name it and we will bring it here.

20:05.704 --> 20:07.664
I confess I do not know the name.

20:11.501 --> 20:14.421
Then we will have to summon all of them.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.937
There, now, Dream,
you may inquire.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.356
Which demon has your helmet?

20:35.192 --> 20:37.444
Shall we interview them one at a time, or…

20:39.488 --> 20:41.198
That won't be necessary.

20:54.962 --> 20:58.298
It surprises us
how easily you would give up, Dream.

20:59.174 --> 21:02.094
We know how you relied upon your tools.

21:03.095 --> 21:06.974
But tools are the subtlest of traps.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.143
We become reliant upon them

21:10.227 --> 21:14.356
and in their absence we are vulnerable,

21:15.357 --> 21:18.277
weak, defenseless.

21:19.611 --> 21:20.737
Not entirely.

21:25.325 --> 21:27.452
I have recovered my sand.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.372
It brought me to Hell

21:31.081 --> 21:34.835
and now it brings
that which is mine in Hell to me.

22:09.578 --> 22:10.996
Tell me your name, demon.

22:11.079 --> 22:12.372
Do I have to tell him?

22:12.456 --> 22:16.501
That is Choronzon. A Duke of Hell.

22:16.585 --> 22:17.794
Choronzon…

22:19.796 --> 22:24.217
The helm is mine.
You must return it to me.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.262
No. It's mine now.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.307
I traded it from a mortal
for a paltry thing.

22:30.891 --> 22:33.894
It was a fair trade. I've broken no laws.

22:34.478 --> 22:37.022
And if the Dream King wants his helm back,

22:38.899 --> 22:40.776
he will have to fight me for it.

22:42.235 --> 22:43.612
Very well.

22:44.821 --> 22:46.656
I challenge you, Choronzon.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.118
You know the rules, Dream Lord.

22:50.202 --> 22:53.372
If I win, you will return my helmet.

22:53.455 --> 22:54.998
And if you lose,

22:55.665 --> 23:00.837
you'll serve as my slave
in Hell for eternity.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.011
I accept the terms.

23:09.554 --> 23:12.808
And whom will you choose
to represent you in the battle?

23:13.975 --> 23:15.560
I shall represent myself.

23:16.603 --> 23:21.733
Choronzon, whom will you choose
to represent you?

23:21.817 --> 23:22.943
Hmm…

23:26.863 --> 23:30.367
I choose you, sire.

23:45.382 --> 23:51.096
Apologies, Dream, but the laws of Hell
demand that I become his champion.

23:53.765 --> 23:55.851
But if you would not fight me.

23:58.895 --> 24:00.439
I have accepted the terms.

24:04.192 --> 24:05.694
Let the challenge begin.

24:20.333 --> 24:21.543
I won't be five minutes.

24:21.626 --> 24:24.379
-Oh, we'll be fine. You take your time.

24:41.563 --> 24:43.482
Looks like I have to pre-pay inside.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.525
Do you want anything? Are you thirsty?

24:46.485 --> 24:48.236
No, thank you. I'm fine.

24:49.529 --> 24:50.530
I won't be a minute.

24:55.285 --> 24:57.996
Actually, uh, Rosemary…

24:59.122 --> 24:59.998
Uh…

25:01.791 --> 25:03.919
I could use a drink, if you don't mind.

25:04.628 --> 25:05.962
Sure. What would you like?

25:08.131 --> 25:11.593
I don't know. I haven't been out
in the world for 30 years.

25:13.261 --> 25:14.930
You've been in prison for 30 years?

25:15.013 --> 25:17.516
No, uh, psychiatric hospital.

25:17.599 --> 25:21.728
Uh, the beverage options
were extremely limited to say the least.

25:21.811 --> 25:22.854
After you.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.126
Whatever you want, my treat.

25:46.503 --> 25:47.587
Are you sure?

25:47.671 --> 25:48.588
Absolutely.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.132
I'll just give the guy my credit card.

26:05.605 --> 26:08.775
I need you
to call 9-1-1 for me.

26:09.484 --> 26:10.652
I'm sorry. What?

26:10.735 --> 26:13.613
I need you
to call 9-1-1 for me.

26:13.697 --> 26:16.408
The man I'm with is an escaped murderer.

26:19.869 --> 26:22.872
-You fucking with me?
-Please just call 9-1-1.

26:22.956 --> 26:23.873
All right.

26:25.166 --> 26:26.710
I'm calling them right now.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.296
Yeah, hi.

26:29.379 --> 26:31.214
I'm calling to report an emergency.

26:31.298 --> 26:34.050
This is the filling station
out on route seven.

26:35.844 --> 26:36.803
That's right.

26:43.977 --> 26:46.313
Yeah. That's right.

26:48.481 --> 26:49.899
Wanna send somebody down…

26:49.983 --> 26:51.443
Rosemary, we need to go.

27:02.162 --> 27:03.204
Let go of her.

27:04.414 --> 27:07.917
And we're gonna wait here,
the three of us, for the police.

27:08.501 --> 27:13.006
Young man, I assure you,
you don't want to point that gun at me.

27:15.258 --> 27:18.803
Sir, if you don't stay where you are,
I will shoot you.

27:19.346 --> 27:20.472
Please don't.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.517
You'll only be hurting yourself.

27:50.418 --> 27:52.420
You shouldn't have done that.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.256
It's my fault for trusting you.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.094
Are you gonna hurt me?

28:02.389 --> 28:04.307
Are you taking me to my ruby?

28:09.354 --> 28:11.398
Then I have no reason to hurt you.

28:16.319 --> 28:17.612
Until you give me one.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.913
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

28:27.997 --> 28:31.793
Today for your entertainment
and delectation,

28:31.876 --> 28:33.336
a formal challenge.

28:35.255 --> 28:37.716
The challenger is Dream.

28:38.717 --> 28:42.220
Once the Master of the Realm of Sleep.

28:43.972 --> 28:46.599
As the challenged,
I've selected my champion,

28:47.267 --> 28:51.563
Ruler of Hell, Lucifer Morningstar…

28:55.233 --> 29:02.073
…to represent me in a contest of skill,
confidence and transformation.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.075
The oldest game.

29:07.746 --> 29:10.123
Matthew, I need you
to return to The Dreaming.

29:10.206 --> 29:11.374
What? No!

29:11.458 --> 29:13.209
It's the only reason
I allowed you to come.

29:13.293 --> 29:14.502
So I could leave you?

29:14.586 --> 29:16.004
If I should not be able to leave,

29:16.087 --> 29:18.882
I would not have Lucienne left alone
with no word of my fate.

29:20.133 --> 29:21.259
Not again.

29:21.342 --> 29:24.804
-The sand will take you back.
-I'm not going back.

29:24.888 --> 29:28.850
Morpheus, am I interrupting
a preliminary bout of some kind?

29:28.933 --> 29:32.228
Just a ringside pep talk, Your Majesty.

29:32.896 --> 29:37.400
We came here for the helm
and we're not leaving here without it.

29:37.984 --> 29:39.360
We shall see.

29:58.963 --> 30:00.590
As the challenged,

30:01.424 --> 30:07.096
I set the meter and take the first move.

30:09.224 --> 30:10.183
Very well.

30:13.353 --> 30:14.854
Make your move.

30:18.191 --> 30:19.192
I am…

30:20.902 --> 30:22.821
a dire wolf.

30:23.613 --> 30:26.908
Prey-stalking, lethal prowler.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.372
I am a hunter.

30:33.498 --> 30:37.752
Horse-mounted, wolf-stabbing.

30:55.478 --> 30:59.399
I am a serpent.

30:59.482 --> 31:01.192
Horse-biting…

31:02.110 --> 31:05.989
-…poison-toothed.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.330
I am a bird of prey.

31:14.914 --> 31:19.043
Snake-devouring, talons ripping.

31:30.013 --> 31:35.643
I am a butcher bacterium.

31:37.061 --> 31:39.814
Warm-life destroying.

31:49.908 --> 31:53.453
I am a world.

31:54.704 --> 31:59.250
Space-floating, life-nurturing.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.923
I am a nova.

32:05.548 --> 32:08.593
All-exploding, planet-cremating.

32:28.196 --> 32:30.406
I am a universe.

32:31.449 --> 32:36.955
All things encompassing,
all life embracing.

32:39.457 --> 32:42.877
I am anti-life.

32:46.422 --> 32:48.841
The Beast of Judgement.

32:51.427 --> 32:55.848
The dark at the end of everything.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.652
What will you be then, Dream Lord?

33:14.784 --> 33:15.702
I…

33:19.539 --> 33:20.581
I…

33:23.376 --> 33:24.419
I …

33:26.421 --> 33:27.463
Boss?

33:28.381 --> 33:30.675
Hey, boss!

33:30.758 --> 33:32.593
Still with us, Dream?

33:32.677 --> 33:36.264
He is and it's his move, Your Majesty.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.099
There are no more moves.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.394
What can survive the anti-life?

33:42.228 --> 33:46.441
Hey, boss. Listen to me.
You know what can survive the anti-life?

33:46.983 --> 33:47.942
You.

33:48.484 --> 33:50.695
Dreams don't fucking die.

33:50.778 --> 33:51.904
Not if you believe in them,

33:51.988 --> 33:57.535
and I believe Dream of the Endless
would never leave his raven here alone,

33:57.618 --> 34:00.413
in Hell with Lucifer.

34:04.625 --> 34:05.668
I…

34:08.129 --> 34:09.088
am…

34:19.640 --> 34:20.516
hope.

34:32.236 --> 34:33.112
Hope.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.244
Well, Lightbringer?

34:41.746 --> 34:42.955
It's your move.

34:44.123 --> 34:46.584
What is it that kills hope?

34:51.672 --> 34:53.424
Choronzon, give him his helm.

34:55.343 --> 34:56.177
No.

34:58.012 --> 34:58.846
I won't.

34:59.388 --> 35:01.682
It's mine. Please.

35:37.218 --> 35:38.469
Thank you, Mazikeen.

35:45.518 --> 35:46.644
Thank you, Lightbringer.

35:47.228 --> 35:49.730
The Ruler of Hell is honorable, indeed.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.399
I will not forget this.

35:52.775 --> 35:53.943
Honorable?

35:56.320 --> 35:58.239
You joke, surely.

36:00.324 --> 36:01.826
Look out there, Morpheus.

36:02.994 --> 36:06.414
The billion Lords of Hell
stand arrayed about you.

36:07.748 --> 36:08.833
Tell us.

36:10.585 --> 36:12.545
Why should we let you leave?

36:13.129 --> 36:15.923
Helmet or no, you have no power here.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.133
After all…

36:18.634 --> 36:23.639
What power have dreams in Hell?

36:26.392 --> 36:28.644
You say I have no power here.

36:31.272 --> 36:32.732
Perhaps you speak truly.

36:34.942 --> 36:38.154
But to say dreams have no power in Hell…

36:40.615 --> 36:42.867
Tell me, Lucifer Morningstar,

36:43.743 --> 36:46.829
what power would Hell have
if those here imprisoned

36:46.913 --> 36:48.206
were not able to dream…

36:51.792 --> 36:52.752
of Heaven?

37:02.428 --> 37:03.971
One day, Morpheus…

37:07.475 --> 37:09.310
we shall destroy you.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.982
Until that day, Lightbringer.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.646
You think
Lucifer will come after you?

37:53.729 --> 37:54.772
Why?

37:54.855 --> 37:58.109
Because you just
publicly humiliated the Ruler of Hell.

38:03.364 --> 38:05.199
Can you even see in that thing?

38:05.283 --> 38:06.242
I can.

38:07.368 --> 38:08.953
I can see the ruby.

38:55.416 --> 38:56.500
Something's wrong.

38:57.460 --> 38:58.836
Someone's altered it.

39:03.841 --> 39:04.759
This is it?

39:05.259 --> 39:07.345
Yes. Thank you.

40:25.548 --> 40:26.924
What are you still doing here?

40:28.592 --> 40:30.511
I know I'm gonna regret this but…

40:31.971 --> 40:33.639
Do you need a ride somewhere?

40:36.892 --> 40:39.645
Do you really want me
to get back into that truck?

40:39.728 --> 40:41.313
The truth. No lies.

40:43.399 --> 40:44.358
I wanna go home.

40:46.152 --> 40:48.362
You're a good person, Rosemary.

40:50.531 --> 40:55.453
Unfortunately, good people
seldom survive in this world.

40:58.038 --> 41:00.583
Just don't hurt Susie, please.

41:00.666 --> 41:02.626
I don't care what happens to me but…

41:05.379 --> 41:06.297
Here.

41:07.423 --> 41:08.466
Take it.

41:10.843 --> 41:12.011
Wear it.

41:14.388 --> 41:18.350
From now on,
no one will be able to hurt you.

41:18.434 --> 41:19.560
Not even me.

41:20.227 --> 41:23.314
There's no need to be afraid
or tell a lie ever again.

41:25.691 --> 41:26.859
Don't you need it?

41:26.942 --> 41:30.988
No. I have my ruby.

41:32.406 --> 41:34.950
Boss. Boss!

41:35.034 --> 41:37.244
The ruby makes dreams come true.

41:39.747 --> 41:44.460
And I'm going to use it to save the world.
