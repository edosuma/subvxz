WEBVTT

00:11.958 --> 00:13.458
-Nine-one-one, emergency!
-Aah!

00:13.541 --> 00:15.208
Gimme your phone,
we don't got a lotta time!

00:15.291 --> 00:18.083
Oh my God… Did North Korea
make a missile that can reach Chicago?

00:18.166 --> 00:21.041
No, worse! The radio station
blocked both my numbers

00:21.125 --> 00:23.083
and I want to request some tunes!

00:23.166 --> 00:24.416
Damn it, I'm on hold!

00:24.500 --> 00:28.125
<i>Welcome back to Dank Sherman</i>
<i>and the Fug on WRAG, the Wrag!</i>

00:28.208 --> 00:29.458
<i>-Let's take a caller.</i>

00:29.541 --> 00:30.958
<i>S'up? You're on the Wrag!</i>

00:31.041 --> 00:32.083
I got through!

00:32.166 --> 00:35.875
Hi there, I'd like to hear
"American Woman" by The Guess Who,

00:35.958 --> 00:38.250
not that BS Lenny Kravitz cover.

00:38.333 --> 00:39.833
Lenny Kravitz, the actor?

00:39.916 --> 00:44.541
Lady, the only thing we're playing
this a.m. is Jug Jenga!

00:44.625 --> 00:47.875
We got two babes here
that used to be servers at Hooters.

00:47.958 --> 00:49.166
Now, they're just moms.

00:49.250 --> 00:52.791
And we're seeing how many Jenga pieces
they can balance on their racks.

00:52.875 --> 00:55.750
-And unless you think you can beat them--

00:55.833 --> 00:56.666
Ugh!

00:56.750 --> 00:57.916
She's on her way.

01:00.250 --> 01:04.958
Don't be shy, Fug, my girls have
handled much bigger wood than that.

01:05.041 --> 01:07.375
And that's all the pieces,

01:07.458 --> 01:10.375
making Diane Dunbrowski
our Jug Jenga champ!

01:10.458 --> 01:13.250
-Wow, those milk wagons are unreal.

01:13.333 --> 01:16.541
Yeah, these were an FDA experiment
in the '90s.

01:16.625 --> 01:19.541
I was kind of a breast implant guinea pig.

01:19.625 --> 01:23.125
Oh, watch it! We're Italian American pigs!

01:23.208 --> 01:26.875
-<i>Mamma mia!</i>

01:26.958 --> 01:28.625
Classic Fug!

01:28.708 --> 01:31.666
And the prize is… a free mammogram,

01:31.750 --> 01:35.250
courtesy of WRAG's
Breast Cancer Awareness Week.

01:35.333 --> 01:39.000
Coming up, we're gonna reunite
a porn star with her biological dad,

01:39.083 --> 01:41.041
if she can name all 50 states.

01:41.125 --> 01:43.291
Oh, I'm sticking around for that.

01:51.958 --> 01:55.125
Then she said
Las Vegas was a state

01:55.208 --> 01:59.541
and they played a clip of <i>Ren and Stimpy</i>
where he goes, "You idiot!"

01:59.625 --> 02:00.958
It was classic!

02:01.041 --> 02:02.458
How's that show even still on?

02:02.541 --> 02:03.875
It's so degrading to women.

02:03.958 --> 02:05.625
Who listen to radio anymore?

02:05.708 --> 02:07.083
Podcasts all the way, baby!

02:07.166 --> 02:09.041
Speaking of which,
please subscribe to mine.

02:09.125 --> 02:10.041
I keep asking you.

02:10.125 --> 02:12.500
Diane, you gotta get on that mammogram.

02:12.583 --> 02:14.000
They're mad expensive

02:14.083 --> 02:16.041
and our Borough insurance
doesn't cover them.

02:16.125 --> 02:17.791
We have health insurance?

02:17.875 --> 02:20.083
Yes, the company is Grey Cross.

02:20.166 --> 02:23.291
They are horrible!
Their slogan is "Walk it off."

02:23.375 --> 02:24.625
Hello, all!

02:24.708 --> 02:27.375
I just had a wonderful breakthrough
with my therapist.

02:27.458 --> 02:31.041
She told me I may be allergic
to toxic people.

02:31.125 --> 02:32.583
Gideon, we gotta talk!

02:32.666 --> 02:34.833
She was right!

02:34.916 --> 02:37.000
What's up with our cheapo
health insurance?

02:37.083 --> 02:40.208
I'd think you'd want good coverage,
seeing as you're getting up there.

02:40.291 --> 02:42.125
-You are older than me!
-Mm!

02:42.208 --> 02:44.583
He doesn't care. He's on a manager plan.

02:44.666 --> 02:46.625
That's how he can afford
to see a therapist.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.208
Wait, how does that work?

02:48.291 --> 02:51.875
Diane, it is company policy
that all non-managerial employees

02:51.958 --> 02:53.375
have basic coverage,

02:53.458 --> 02:56.500
which makes sense,
because you are a basic bitch.

02:57.833 --> 03:00.833
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go pop a Benadryl.

03:00.916 --> 03:02.208
Mm! Told you.

03:02.291 --> 03:05.000
Take advantage
of any health care you can get, Diane.

03:05.083 --> 03:08.208
I heard you didn't need a mammogram
if you had breast implants.

03:08.291 --> 03:10.541
You need to stop getting medical advice

03:10.625 --> 03:12.000
-from Snapple caps!
-Mm-hmm!

03:14.375 --> 03:16.958
Daniel, it's time for an adventure!

03:17.041 --> 03:20.291
Please stop calling going to the basement
to clear the rat traps an adventure.

03:20.375 --> 03:21.958
No rats today. Huh!

03:22.041 --> 03:25.791
Kreativ Jus is launching a new program
to educate children

03:25.875 --> 03:29.375
that juice is the healthy alternative
to processed sugars.

03:29.458 --> 03:33.250
Uh. the Raspberry Blaster
has more sugar than ten Snickers bars.

03:33.333 --> 03:35.291
It's natural sugar, Daniel!

03:35.958 --> 03:40.583
Corporate assigned each store
one school district in the city

03:40.666 --> 03:44.166
to pass out free samples
during youth sporting events,

03:44.250 --> 03:47.625
and I want you
to be my wingman in the juice van!

03:47.708 --> 03:49.250
Oh, that sounds kinda cool!

03:49.333 --> 03:51.666
You do have
a valid driver's license, right?

03:51.750 --> 03:57.166
I do, but my parents never let me drive
in the city, or much at all.

03:57.250 --> 03:59.208
They felt it would trigger my anxiety.

03:59.291 --> 04:03.041
Well, my license is suspended
due to my younger days.

04:03.125 --> 04:06.916
Let's just say,
alcohol and road rage don't mix…

04:07.000 --> 04:08.541
with cocaine and Fentanyl.

04:08.625 --> 04:10.333
You know what? I'm in.

04:10.416 --> 04:12.333
It's time to confront my anxiety--

04:12.416 --> 04:14.166
-Oh my God, horn!

04:16.125 --> 04:19.416
Are you looking at that shirtless pic
of Hugh Jackman I put on our Pinterest?

04:19.500 --> 04:20.333
Yowza, right?

04:20.416 --> 04:23.458
No, I was confirming my next appointment
with Doctor Perlow.

04:23.541 --> 04:26.125
Oh, right, right. Final test results.

04:26.208 --> 04:27.083
Well, not final.

04:27.166 --> 04:30.333
Even if I can't produce the baby myself,
we have other options.

04:30.416 --> 04:31.500
There's surrogacy…

04:31.583 --> 04:33.750
I will say I am
a little worried about that.

04:33.833 --> 04:36.750
I read in <i>Departures</i> magazine,
it's very expensive

04:36.833 --> 04:40.458
and I don't know about me
having S-E-X with another woman.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.416
Mark, I told you,
that is not how it works.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.250
We don't even need to talk about this.

04:44.333 --> 04:46.625
You have been taking
such good care of yourself.

04:46.708 --> 04:48.625
And, may I say, it shows.

04:48.708 --> 04:51.250
That womb is ready to bloom.

04:51.333 --> 04:55.000
Mark, my basal temp is rising.

04:56.500 --> 04:59.583
Why don't I check it… with my penis?

04:59.666 --> 05:02.625
Okay, but I have book club
in five minutes.

05:02.708 --> 05:05.375
Oh, sounds like someone
wants to do it twice.

05:08.083 --> 05:12.208
How much longer? The infection
is moving from my eye down to my arm.

05:13.250 --> 05:16.250
Uh, I called earlier
about my mammogram gift certificate?

05:16.333 --> 05:18.916
Have a seat and fill out this paperwork.
We'll be right with you.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.333
Great! And hey,
thanks for "squeezing" me in.

05:28.500 --> 05:31.000
I'll, uh… I'll just sit down.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.208
What, are you the doctor too?

05:35.291 --> 05:36.625
I'm a physician's assistant.

05:36.708 --> 05:38.375
Sorry, we're really short-staffed.

05:39.250 --> 05:41.625
So, I gotta put my slammers in that?

05:41.708 --> 05:43.375
Is it gonna burst my implants?

05:43.458 --> 05:46.083
Not yours. They're very dense.

05:46.166 --> 05:47.666
Mm. Much obliged.

05:47.750 --> 05:52.125
Now, I'm going to lower the clamp,
so you may feel some pressure.

05:52.208 --> 05:56.333
Okay, this isn't too baaad!

05:56.416 --> 05:58.875
Oh, sweet Stan Mikita's ghost!

05:59.583 --> 06:00.416
Whoo!

06:00.500 --> 06:03.166
I didn't know my fun bags could
take that much squeezing.

06:03.250 --> 06:06.416
And I once got to second base
with André the Giant.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.958
So, I'll call you in a couple of days
with the results.

06:09.041 --> 06:10.875
You'd think they'd-- Ow!

06:10.958 --> 06:11.833
Come up with a test--

06:11.916 --> 06:12.750
Ow!

06:12.833 --> 06:14.000
Better than this-- Ow!

06:14.083 --> 06:15.875
Can jammer-- Ow!

06:15.958 --> 06:17.875
Wait, that one's my Juicy Fruit.

06:17.958 --> 06:19.541
Mm!

06:20.541 --> 06:23.375
Okay, you got this. It's just driving.

06:23.458 --> 06:26.375
Ready to spread the joy of juice?

06:26.458 --> 06:29.958
Oh wow, you grew a very thin mustache.

06:30.041 --> 06:32.625
Oh, well, I'm reforesting my upper lip

06:32.708 --> 06:35.833
to raise awareness of the deforesting
in the Amazon.

06:36.833 --> 06:42.000
Now, Daniel, I am a sherpa helping you
climb the mountain that is vehophobia.

06:42.083 --> 06:44.125
Just… ease into traffic.

06:44.208 --> 06:46.000
-Okay…

06:46.583 --> 06:47.666
Hey, watch it!

06:47.750 --> 06:50.000
Fuck off, you worthless sack of shit!

06:50.500 --> 06:53.708
-Apologies, Daniel, old habits die hard.

06:54.250 --> 06:55.333
And one more…

06:55.416 --> 06:57.333
-Wow, girl! Okay!
-This is very impressive!

06:57.416 --> 06:58.916
That's a nice little trick.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.791
-Zuzs, put it on speaker.

07:00.875 --> 07:02.500
I'm about to break my record.

07:02.583 --> 07:03.416
Yes, I got it.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.708
Go for Diane!

07:04.791 --> 07:07.000
Hello, Diane, it's Cathy
from the Nadir Clinic.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.500
I have your mammogram results.

07:08.583 --> 07:12.833
Let me guess, I tested positive
for bodacious tatas?

07:13.833 --> 07:16.166
That was funny
when you said it in the office as well.

07:16.250 --> 07:19.750
Now, uh, we did find a lump
in the upper quadrant of your left breast.

07:19.833 --> 07:20.666
-Uh!

07:21.833 --> 07:23.208
What does that mean?

07:23.291 --> 07:26.125
Most times it's nothing,
unless it's something,

07:26.208 --> 07:27.916
and that something could be very bad.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.125
So, I'd like you to come in
for an ultrasound.

07:30.208 --> 07:31.541
Holy shit!

07:31.625 --> 07:34.250
Let me run this through your insurance.
What's the I.D. number?

07:34.333 --> 07:38.041
Uh… one second. Where is it?
Hold on, hold on. Uh…

07:38.125 --> 07:40.250
Okay… Got it.

07:40.333 --> 07:43.750
It's four-six-nine, nice,
seven-three-five-six-nine, nice,

07:43.833 --> 07:45.791
three-four-twenty, also nice, five.

07:46.833 --> 07:49.041
Okay. Looks like your policy
doesn't cover this.

07:49.125 --> 07:51.333
So, uh, you'd have to pay out of pocket,

07:51.416 --> 07:54.125
which, all said and done,
is usually about $3,000.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.875
I don't have that kind of money!

07:55.958 --> 07:57.541
-You could always try a GoFundMe.
-Uh!

07:58.541 --> 08:01.333
Go fund me? Go fund yourself!

08:02.958 --> 08:05.041
I always thought I'd pass away suddenly

08:05.125 --> 08:07.833
while in a threesome
with John and Joan Cusack.

08:07.916 --> 08:09.250
They are related.

08:09.333 --> 08:10.500
Yeah, but I'm not!

08:10.583 --> 08:13.166
It's just a lump, Diane,
it's not a death sentence.

08:13.250 --> 08:14.083
You're okay.

08:14.166 --> 08:16.500
I've never dealt with anything like this.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.916
It's terrifying.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.125
Diane, remember what I told you
after the Bears lost Super Bowl XLI?

08:22.208 --> 08:24.875
That Peyton Manning looks like a thumb,
but would bang?

08:24.958 --> 08:26.833
No, that's what you said.

08:26.916 --> 08:31.000
I said that you were strong
and you can get through anything.

08:31.083 --> 08:33.250
You got this because we got you.

08:33.750 --> 08:34.958
Thanks, girls.

08:35.041 --> 08:38.583
This is nice! We never just sit on couch
and dish the gossip.

08:38.666 --> 08:40.916
-Okay, not the time, girl.

08:43.291 --> 08:44.125
Huh.

08:44.208 --> 08:45.750
That's a good deal.

08:45.833 --> 08:47.125
Hey, how are you?

08:47.208 --> 08:48.333
I hate driving!

08:48.416 --> 08:51.125
Today, Feather told an ambulance
to kill itself!

08:51.208 --> 08:52.375
Daniel, driving's easy.

08:52.458 --> 08:54.791
What did <i>Fast and the Furious</i> teach us?

08:54.875 --> 08:57.583
That a Dodge Charger
can outrun a helicopter?

08:57.666 --> 09:01.833
Yes, and always be on offense.
That's how the job gets done.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.583
Hey, speaking of jobs,

09:03.666 --> 09:05.958
what's your health insurance
sitch at work?

09:06.041 --> 09:06.875
Awful.

09:06.958 --> 09:10.916
Kreativ Jus's benefits are crystal-based,
so I stayed on my parents' plan.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.291
Holy shit, that is heavy.
Is this real gold?

09:14.375 --> 09:16.291
No, it's just gold-plated.

09:16.375 --> 09:19.458
Wait, why are you asking about insurance?
Are you okay?

09:19.541 --> 09:21.083
Daniel, I'm fine.

09:21.166 --> 09:23.791
Could a person who wasn't fine do this?

09:23.875 --> 09:24.708
Rah!

09:25.708 --> 09:28.833
Red Stripe? I haven't had that since…
Thanksgiving.

09:28.916 --> 09:32.583
I see a lot of ovarian follicles
not responding to hormones.

09:32.666 --> 09:35.083
Well, I-I guess Mark and I should--

09:35.166 --> 09:37.208
What do you mean
I'm not Bonnie Whiddington?

09:37.291 --> 09:39.041
Here's my golden insurance card!

09:39.125 --> 09:40.750
-What the--?
-Suburbs rock!

09:40.833 --> 09:43.791
Look at my channel wallet.
Golf is a sport.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.083
Diane?

09:45.166 --> 09:46.000
Oh!

09:46.083 --> 09:47.875
Uh…

09:47.958 --> 09:50.541
It's like looking in a mirror!

09:52.541 --> 09:54.666
What were you doing
at the doctor, anyways?

09:54.750 --> 09:56.875
Finally getting your cankles
taken care of?

09:56.958 --> 09:58.250
I don't have cankles!

09:58.333 --> 09:59.708
Ugh, that's not the point.

09:59.791 --> 10:03.000
I can't believe you didn't tell me
what was going on with you, Diane.

10:03.083 --> 10:04.791
I didn't want to worry you!

10:04.875 --> 10:07.416
Look, I'm gonna treat this
like cutting hair.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.291
Wing it and hope for the best.

10:09.375 --> 10:10.666
Oh, the hell you are!

10:10.750 --> 10:14.166
I am not letting my sister
"hope for the best,"

10:14.250 --> 10:16.708
like some kind of Christian Scientist.

10:17.708 --> 10:19.791
I will get you in with my doctor.

10:19.875 --> 10:20.708
Really?

10:20.791 --> 10:24.916
Oh, no, these fertility treatments
basically bought her a second home.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.125
She owes me.

10:26.208 --> 10:29.291
Wow, thank you, Bonnie. Truly.

10:29.375 --> 10:31.208
This is such a relief.

10:31.291 --> 10:32.541
Of course.

10:32.625 --> 10:36.875
So… should we grab a carafe of Pinot Gris?

10:36.958 --> 10:38.291
It's 10:00 a.m.

10:38.375 --> 10:39.458
Copy that.

10:39.541 --> 10:40.708
We'll get Merlot.

10:44.666 --> 10:48.041
Remember, just keep your hands
at North Star and Solstice.

10:48.125 --> 10:49.750
Don't you mean ten and two?

10:49.833 --> 10:52.250
Well, I only tell time by a sundial.

10:52.333 --> 10:54.208
It's actually much more accurate,
you'll see.

10:54.291 --> 10:56.916
-Goddammit! I'm soaked!

10:57.000 --> 10:58.083
That wasn't my fault!

10:58.166 --> 11:01.166
It's okay. It's okay.
I'll just cover it up.

11:01.958 --> 11:02.791
Oh, God!

11:02.875 --> 11:04.166
Suck my whole ass!

11:04.666 --> 11:06.500
Ooh. My blue blockers.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.125
-I've been looking for these.

11:08.208 --> 11:10.583
I can't get over this place, Bon.

11:10.666 --> 11:12.958
They have a valet just for jackets!

11:13.041 --> 11:14.541
It's called a coat check.

11:14.625 --> 11:16.958
Welcome to Northwestern Women's Health.

11:17.041 --> 11:19.583
I'll be bringing out
some fresh biscotti in a sec.

11:19.666 --> 11:22.916
But for now, have a seat
and make yourself comfortable.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.625
I know where I'd be
the most comfortable sitting.

11:25.708 --> 11:28.375
Diane! Oh, thank you so much.

11:28.458 --> 11:32.375
What? That hunk of beefsteak
looks just like Rock Johnson.

11:32.458 --> 11:34.875
Oh, I loved him in the new <i>Jumanji</i> movie.

11:34.958 --> 11:36.000
<i>Jumanji?</i>

11:36.083 --> 11:40.250
No, I'm talking about
the real Rock Johnson? The porno actor.

11:45.166 --> 11:46.791
Balls, these blankets are heavy.

11:46.875 --> 11:48.208
Who the hell would want--?

11:49.208 --> 11:52.041
-They're weighted for your comfort.
-Aah! I'm up! I'm up!

11:52.125 --> 11:53.666
Oh, you must be Diane.

11:53.750 --> 11:55.583
It is so lovely to meet you.

11:55.666 --> 11:58.791
And Bonnie, how are you doing
after yesterday?

11:58.875 --> 12:01.166
I'm fine, thank you.
Don't want to talk about it.

12:01.250 --> 12:04.083
Okay. Well, here's a mug
of soothing jasmine tea.

12:04.166 --> 12:07.708
And the seats are heated,
so let me know if you get too toasty.

12:08.791 --> 12:10.875
So, I filled out your paperwork online.

12:10.958 --> 12:12.958
Here are the questions
you need to ask when--

12:13.041 --> 12:15.083
If you don't tell me
what's going on with you,

12:15.166 --> 12:17.541
you're gonna get a face full
of soothing Aladdin tea!

12:17.625 --> 12:19.000
It's jasmine tea.

12:19.083 --> 12:20.500
Ugh!

12:20.583 --> 12:23.833
All right, the truth is,
yesterday when I was here,

12:23.916 --> 12:28.583
I found out that there's no way for me
to have another baby, naturally.

12:28.666 --> 12:31.708
Oh, shit. Did you tell Mark?

12:31.791 --> 12:34.250
No. It's so embarrassing!

12:34.333 --> 12:38.166
To admit to your husband
that your body is just… done?

12:38.250 --> 12:40.208
He'll understand, Bon.

12:40.291 --> 12:42.291
His body was done years ago.

12:43.791 --> 12:45.500
Plus, Mark adores you.

12:45.583 --> 12:47.833
And never say your body is done!

12:47.916 --> 12:51.166
If you can't get pregnant,
that just means you can fu--

12:51.250 --> 12:53.083
-Diane, we're ready for you.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.875
I might have to do the test out here.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.958
Alright Timmy,
you're playing shortstop today.

13:02.041 --> 13:03.208
Have fun out there.

13:04.375 --> 13:05.916
Thanks, Coach Davis!

13:06.000 --> 13:08.625
Hey, kids, who wants a free treat?

13:08.708 --> 13:10.208
What the hell? Ugh!

13:10.291 --> 13:11.666
Look at this sick bastard.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.250
Hey! You! Beat it!

13:13.333 --> 13:14.416
Don't worry, sir.

13:14.500 --> 13:17.000
I have something for you to slurp too!

13:17.083 --> 13:18.666
-Get the hell out!

13:18.750 --> 13:20.041
I'm not going anywhere!

13:20.125 --> 13:22.083
I'm here to change these kids forever.

13:22.166 --> 13:24.541
It's time to put something healthy
in their mouths!

13:24.625 --> 13:27.625
Hank! Phil! Grab some bats.
We got another pervert!

13:27.708 --> 13:29.750
Oh, this… isn't good.

13:29.833 --> 13:31.291
Oh, I'm not--

13:31.375 --> 13:33.916
-It's a pervert van!
-Uh, no. Oh! Oh…

13:34.000 --> 13:36.041
Oh, no! No, you don't understand.

13:36.125 --> 13:40.000
No, see, my colleague and I
were driving and I got covered in juice.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.708
Oh, I bet you did.

13:41.791 --> 13:44.166
Okay, this is a misunderstanding, but I--

13:44.250 --> 13:45.458
Just drive, Daniel!

13:45.541 --> 13:47.875
-It won't move!
-Do you have the parking brake on?

13:47.958 --> 13:50.166
-I don't know what a parking brake is!
-Aah!

13:50.250 --> 13:52.458
See? That wasn't so bad.

13:52.541 --> 13:54.833
Here's a towel
to wipe off the ultrasound gel.

13:54.916 --> 13:58.833
Oh, I'd like a bottle of that for…
personal reasons.

13:58.916 --> 14:01.541
-Diane!
-Anyhoo, glad that's done.

14:01.625 --> 14:03.375
So, what's the score? Did I pass?

14:03.458 --> 14:05.416
Well, we still have
to look over the images,

14:05.500 --> 14:08.666
but I'll have the results
first thing Monday morning.

14:08.750 --> 14:10.416
I gotta wait all weekend?

14:11.041 --> 14:13.041
Okay. I can do that.

14:13.125 --> 14:15.666
No problemo.

14:28.458 --> 14:29.583
Doctor Perlow?

14:29.666 --> 14:31.375
Diane! Hope you had a good weekend.

14:31.458 --> 14:34.166
Can't say we did. Our hot tub
at the lake house overflowed--

14:34.250 --> 14:35.666
Ultrasound results, please!

14:35.750 --> 14:37.041
Oh, right, right, yes.

14:37.125 --> 14:40.875
Well, good news. That lump was
nothing more than a harmless cyst.

14:42.166 --> 14:44.666
Sweet Ditka's dick! What a relief!

14:44.750 --> 14:46.000
However, uh,

14:46.083 --> 14:49.541
your implants are hardened
due to a calcium buildup.

14:49.625 --> 14:51.875
Nice! Calcium is good, right?

14:52.375 --> 14:54.416
No, it's-- it's very bad.

14:54.500 --> 14:57.583
Diane, you need to get
your breast implants removed.

14:57.666 --> 14:59.958
But I've had these babies for decades.

15:00.041 --> 15:01.083
I could tell!

15:01.166 --> 15:03.708
The serial number on them was 11.

15:03.791 --> 15:06.333
All right. When can I come
and knock this out?

15:06.416 --> 15:09.166
Well, I saw you as a favor
for your sister,

15:09.250 --> 15:12.958
but unfortunately,
I can't do surgery as a favor, so--

15:13.041 --> 15:14.625
I don't care how much it costs,

15:14.708 --> 15:17.208
I'm not going back
to my shitty little clinic!

15:17.291 --> 15:21.416
Okay. Well, these procedures
usually run about 50 grand.

15:21.500 --> 15:25.083
Um, and to finish, the doctor will use
a more economic technique

15:25.166 --> 15:29.083
called "battlefield stitches"
to close up your skin and

15:29.166 --> 15:30.000
<i>patch up any--</i>

15:30.083 --> 15:32.541
Yeah, yeah, how much
is this gonna set me back?

15:32.625 --> 15:34.791
<i>Uh, about $10,000.</i>

15:34.875 --> 15:36.166
Hold, please.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.333
Ten grand?!

15:38.416 --> 15:40.291
Where am I supposed to come up with that?!

15:40.375 --> 15:42.583
I would say get into foot-camming,

15:42.666 --> 15:46.000
but the market is
over saturated now, believe me.

15:46.083 --> 15:49.416
So, your next best option
is to apply for a medical loan.

15:49.500 --> 15:52.541
Mm-mm! Diane, the terms
of this loan are terrible.

15:52.625 --> 15:56.208
I know! They say I have to
be an organ donor pre-mortem.

15:56.291 --> 16:00.666
But it's my only option because
<i>someone</i> doesn't care about his employees.

16:00.750 --> 16:04.375
Diane, I'm sorry this is how it is,
but it's not me. It's corporate.

16:04.458 --> 16:05.916
You are corporate!

16:06.000 --> 16:09.041
Yep, she's right, Gideon.
Our plan is terrible.

16:09.125 --> 16:11.583
I had to take out my own appendix.

16:11.666 --> 16:13.458
I'm sorry, it's not my call.

16:13.541 --> 16:15.000
My hands are tied.

16:16.458 --> 16:17.375
Kinky.

16:18.750 --> 16:19.708
Uh…

16:19.791 --> 16:20.791
Today has been a lot.

16:20.875 --> 16:24.541
What do you say we close up early
and grab a cocktail? My treat.

16:24.625 --> 16:27.458
Thanks, Gideon,
but I'm not really in the mood.

16:28.458 --> 16:30.500
Oh, Lord, this <i>is</i> bad.

16:31.583 --> 16:33.125
May I have some juice, please?

16:33.208 --> 16:34.250
Of course, you can.

16:34.333 --> 16:36.333
The best part is, it's all natural.

16:36.416 --> 16:37.416
Gimme another one!

16:37.500 --> 16:38.416
You got it.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.041
Good call on changing up schools.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.791
Today's going better than yesterday.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.500
They can't get enough of the stuff.

16:43.583 --> 16:47.666
Yeah. I think they're kinda…
wound up on all the sugar.

16:47.750 --> 16:48.875
More juice! More juice!

16:48.958 --> 16:50.625
-Okay. Settle down, kids.
-Juice!

16:50.708 --> 16:53.208
There's enough for everyone. Wow!

16:53.291 --> 16:55.833
Alright kids,
this is our first away game of the season,

16:55.916 --> 16:57.291
so let's show them what--

16:57.375 --> 16:58.791
Oh my God!

16:58.875 --> 17:01.916
Hey! You think I wouldn't recognize you
in your new get-up?

17:02.000 --> 17:03.416
What, are you following us?

17:03.500 --> 17:05.000
Sir, I can explain.

17:05.083 --> 17:06.625
This doesn't concern you, glasses!

17:06.708 --> 17:08.958
Is he a bad stranger, Coach Davis?

17:09.041 --> 17:10.333
He sure is, Braydon.

17:11.333 --> 17:12.708
-Get him!

17:12.791 --> 17:14.833
Ow! Be careful, I have soft ribs.

17:14.916 --> 17:17.708
-This isn't good.
-Ow!

17:17.791 --> 17:19.916
Thanks for taking me to my surgery.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.875
I'm impressed that you wanted
to get to the clinic so early.

17:22.958 --> 17:25.583
Actually, I wanted to give my gals
a little send-off.

17:25.666 --> 17:28.625
Kind of a "Thanks for the mammaries"
for Moe and Larry.

17:28.708 --> 17:30.333
That's what you named them?

17:30.416 --> 17:32.583
Me? Oh, no, Dan Aykroyd did.

17:35.791 --> 17:37.500
This is where I fell overboard,

17:37.583 --> 17:39.625
and these handfuls kept me afloat.

17:41.125 --> 17:44.500
Oh! That's where I told
those Marines we got Bin Laden.

17:44.583 --> 17:46.291
Thank you for your service!

17:46.375 --> 17:48.458
At least I think they were Marines.

17:48.541 --> 17:51.666
And that's where I got motorboated
by Harry Caray.

17:53.875 --> 17:56.750
<i>His heart stopped for almost ten minutes.</i>

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
And that's where it all started.

18:07.083 --> 18:10.250
The doctor's office
where I got these yabbos put in.

18:10.833 --> 18:13.500
That's a shame that it's a taquería now.

18:13.583 --> 18:15.208
No, it was always a taquería.

18:17.875 --> 18:19.333
I'm gonna miss these honkers.

18:19.875 --> 18:22.791
Well, at least your insurance
is covering the procedure.

18:22.875 --> 18:26.000
Yeah… Hey, did you tell Mark yet?

18:26.083 --> 18:26.916
Not yet.

18:27.416 --> 18:30.041
Bon, there's so much good ahead for you.

18:30.125 --> 18:32.208
And you don't need a baby for that.

18:32.291 --> 18:33.750
Aw, thanks, Diane.

18:34.416 --> 18:37.625
And you don't need those babies
for good things either.

18:37.708 --> 18:41.333
Wah! Sweet Lord,
those things are rock-hard!

18:41.416 --> 18:43.208
Yeah, it's not good.

18:43.291 --> 18:45.250
-Good job, Timmy.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.833
Work as a team, boys.

18:46.916 --> 18:48.750
-Get outta here!

18:50.333 --> 18:52.333
Daniel, put your foot on the brake!

18:52.416 --> 18:55.041
I did! It's still not working!

18:55.125 --> 18:57.250
-We don't have time! Hit the gas!

18:59.375 --> 19:00.916
Oh my God! Feather!

19:01.958 --> 19:05.000
Daniel…
you need to get me to a doctor.

19:05.083 --> 19:07.375
I think I broke a couple bones.

19:07.458 --> 19:09.666
Be on offense, like The Rock Johnson!

19:09.750 --> 19:11.875
-What, the porno actor?

19:11.958 --> 19:14.000
-There he is! Get him!

19:14.083 --> 19:14.916
And stay out!

19:16.541 --> 19:17.708
How are you feeling?

19:17.791 --> 19:21.416
Not bad. I did some
pre-anesthesia edibles in the elevator.

19:21.500 --> 19:22.708
Oh, jealous!

19:23.291 --> 19:27.375
Well, all that's left for you to do now
is sign these loan papers.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.916
Right. Let's get it over with.

19:30.708 --> 19:32.791
Don't sign anything!

19:32.875 --> 19:34.041
She's covered.

19:34.125 --> 19:35.458
How did you get back here?

19:35.541 --> 19:37.125
There's no one up front.

19:37.208 --> 19:39.416
Damn it! We have to hire a temp.

19:40.208 --> 19:41.958
I thought only managers were covered.

19:42.041 --> 19:45.750
Well, someone at Borough
just made you a manager.

19:45.833 --> 19:49.000
Oh, hell yeah! Gideon, you're fired!

19:49.083 --> 19:51.125
Oh, it was me, you goofy fool!

19:51.208 --> 19:55.125
And to be clear, you have
no additional authority at work. Okay?

19:56.291 --> 19:58.666
Seriously, Gideon, thank you!

19:59.291 --> 20:01.333
I will never forget this.

20:01.916 --> 20:04.750
Ugh. And I'll never forget
the sight of you in this gown!

20:04.833 --> 20:06.875
You know you have it on backwards, right?

20:09.125 --> 20:10.625
Grr!

20:10.708 --> 20:13.541
Daniel… I don't think I'm gonna make it.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.666
Feather, don't you die on me!

20:15.750 --> 20:18.333
Out of my way, you douche penis!

20:18.916 --> 20:20.791
Less meals, more wheels!

20:20.875 --> 20:23.791
Yes! The open road is my bitch!

20:26.000 --> 20:29.041
I brought Diane some White Castle. Oof!

20:29.125 --> 20:30.958
It is pungent!

20:31.041 --> 20:32.166
Burns the throat.

20:32.250 --> 20:35.291
I gotta say, I'm glad we won't be
having our baby in a place like this.

20:35.375 --> 20:37.750
-I mean, where's the harpist?

20:37.833 --> 20:39.916
Mark, I have to tell you something.

20:41.208 --> 20:43.000
When I went to the doctor, she told me,

20:43.083 --> 20:45.625
there's no way for us
to have children naturally.

20:45.708 --> 20:47.000
My body just can't do it.

20:47.083 --> 20:49.000
Oh, Bon, sweetheart.

20:49.500 --> 20:50.708
It's okay.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.708
I'm open to trying anything.

20:52.791 --> 20:53.916
We can do surrogacy--

20:54.000 --> 20:57.875
Oh, oh! I just listened
to a fascinating<i> Fresh Air</i> about cloning.

20:57.958 --> 21:00.458
Terry Gross interviewed this sheep and I--

21:00.541 --> 21:02.416
Mark, it's fine.

21:02.500 --> 21:04.250
You know, I've thought about it,

21:04.333 --> 21:07.583
and maybe it's not our time
to have another kid.

21:08.083 --> 21:10.541
There's a lot of good things in our life.

21:10.625 --> 21:14.583
Let's just appreciate the people
we have with us here now.

21:14.666 --> 21:15.625
You're sure?

21:15.708 --> 21:16.791
I am.

21:16.875 --> 21:18.625
Help! Help, please!

21:19.833 --> 21:22.916
Where's the oxy? I know you have oxy!

21:23.000 --> 21:25.166
-Hey, kiddo.
-What are you doing here?

21:25.250 --> 21:26.750
Diane's in surgery.

21:26.833 --> 21:27.916
I'm sorry, what?

21:28.000 --> 21:31.541
It's no big deal, she just has
to get her implants out.

21:31.625 --> 21:32.541
Moe and Larry?

21:32.625 --> 21:34.958
How come no one told me
she was having surgery?

21:35.041 --> 21:36.583
We didn't want to worry you!

21:36.666 --> 21:39.375
I don't want to be treated
like a fragile flower anymore!

21:39.458 --> 21:42.541
I drove here! On highways! Like a boss!

21:42.625 --> 21:44.541
Are you the one that ran over your friend?

21:44.625 --> 21:45.833
I am. Is he okay?

21:45.916 --> 21:46.833
Yeah, he'll be fine.

21:46.916 --> 21:48.416
That's fantastic, thank you.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.750
You two were so worried
about me freaking out,

21:50.833 --> 21:53.416
you waited to tell me
you were trying to have another kid!

21:53.500 --> 21:54.833
We're not doing that anymore.

21:54.916 --> 21:56.250
What? Since when?

21:56.333 --> 21:57.541
Like, two minutes ago.

21:58.125 --> 21:59.083
Oh.

21:59.166 --> 22:01.541
Okay, well, thank you for telling me.

22:04.916 --> 22:06.958
-Mm?

22:07.041 --> 22:09.416
I knew there'd be kick-ass rock in heaven.

22:09.500 --> 22:10.916
Aunt Diane, you're fine.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.958
I DM'd the station. Listen!

22:13.041 --> 22:15.166
<i>That last one was for Dirty Diane!</i>

22:15.250 --> 22:17.291
<i>Comin' up next,</i>
<i>we got a couple of juicy GILFS</i>

22:17.375 --> 22:20.708
<i>who are gonna see how many White Claw cans</i>
<i>they can stuff in their mouths.</i>

22:20.791 --> 22:23.125
There's no way those bitches
can out-stuff me!

22:23.208 --> 22:25.625
-God, Diane, your gown is…
-How is that show still on?

22:25.708 --> 22:27.666
This is what I'm meant to do!
