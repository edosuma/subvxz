00:04.844 --> 00:07.246
(theme music playing)

00:09.448 --> 00:11.382
Ms. Reddick,
what's the one word you have

00:11.417 --> 00:13.780
for the way today
makes you feel?

00:13.815 --> 00:15.419
(exhales) Proud.

00:15.454 --> 00:17.784
232 years, and finally

00:17.819 --> 00:19.621
there's a Black female
Supreme Court justice.

00:19.656 --> 00:24.230
Yes, and Ketanji Brown Jackson
will be one of the best.

00:24.265 --> 00:25.627
Were you proud

00:25.662 --> 00:27.266
when Clarence Thomas became
a Supreme Court justice?

00:27.301 --> 00:30.203
(chuckles) Well, that--
uh, that's another matter.

00:30.238 --> 00:32.799
-Because of his politics?
-Well, not-not just that.

00:32.834 --> 00:35.571
Uh, I think
Justice Scalia said--

00:35.606 --> 00:39.311
and yes, I'm about
to cite Antonin Scalia--

00:39.346 --> 00:41.445
but he said about Thomas:

00:41.480 --> 00:44.448
"I am an originalist,
but I am not a nut."

00:44.483 --> 00:46.120
And also, there's the business

00:46.155 --> 00:48.386
of Justice Thomas's wife
a few months ago--

00:48.421 --> 00:50.850
-Ginni Thomas?
-Yes. Yes. Uh,

00:50.885 --> 00:53.787
it besmirched the court
and the country.

00:53.822 --> 00:55.822
You're talking about
her texts with the White House

00:55.857 --> 00:58.693
-after the 2020 election?
-Yes, it was, it was unhinged.

00:58.728 --> 01:01.300
She was speaking to
the president's chief of staff,

01:01.335 --> 01:04.171
Mark Meadows,
about a coup, basically.

01:04.206 --> 01:08.802
I mean, how does that not infect
her husband's judgement?

01:08.837 --> 01:11.145
Well, thank you for coming on
this morning, Ms. Reddick.

01:11.180 --> 01:12.509
Thank you.

01:12.544 --> 01:13.840
DIRECTOR:
And we're clear.

01:13.875 --> 01:15.281
That's it, thanks.

01:15.316 --> 01:16.579
Thank you, ma'am,
it was nice meeting you.

01:16.614 --> 01:18.647
-Thank you, good interview.
-Thanks.

01:18.682 --> 01:21.551
-Oh. Right. (chuckles)
-SOUND GUY: Yes.

01:21.586 --> 01:23.850
-Thank you.
-No, no. Thank you.

01:23.885 --> 01:25.753
We're in a weird time.

01:25.788 --> 01:26.787
(chuckles) Yeah.

01:26.822 --> 01:27.887
Thank you.

01:27.922 --> 01:30.131
(indistinct chatter)

01:44.741 --> 01:47.874
Hey, Jay, we need to get
our security in order.

01:47.909 --> 01:49.315
Why? What's going on?

01:49.350 --> 01:50.481
No, no, no. I just--

01:50.516 --> 01:51.713
I-I think we're just
taking this

01:51.748 --> 01:53.220
<i> all a bit too blithely.</i>

01:56.522 --> 01:58.522
<i> all a</i> Gentlemen.<i> ithely.</i>

02:01.659 --> 02:03.329
Hey, Diane, where are you?

02:03.364 --> 02:05.232
I'm, uh, at the doctor's.

02:05.267 --> 02:06.596
I will, uh, be right in.

02:06.631 --> 02:07.894
<i> Okay. Um, listen.</i>

02:09.931 --> 02:11.502
about the firm's security.

02:11.537 --> 02:13.867
Yeah, I-I agree.
Wh-What happened?

02:13.902 --> 02:16.606
<i>No, uh, nothing new. I'll just--</i>
<i> I'll see you in an hour.</i>

02:21.778 --> 02:23.910
<i> I'll see</i> (sighs)<i> an hour.</i>

02:25.947 --> 02:27.947
<i> I'll</i> (soft beeping)<i> hour.</i>

02:36.760 --> 02:38.199
Hello?

02:39.895 --> 02:42.269
Let me get that.

02:42.304 --> 02:45.470
We should make sure
your phone is off next time.

02:45.505 --> 02:47.472
Yeah. I-I have to get
to work anyway.

02:47.507 --> 02:49.001
But you didn't have
a full treatment.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.772
Yeah. Maybe next time.

02:53.480 --> 02:56.580
♪ ♪

03:02.621 --> 03:04.016
I'm FBI Agent Plummer.

03:04.051 --> 03:06.623
-And this is Agent Emmerich.
-What's wrong?

03:06.658 --> 03:07.921
We want to talk to you alone

03:07.956 --> 03:09.593
about the incidents
of the last week.

03:09.628 --> 03:10.858
Sir, do you mind?

03:10.893 --> 03:12.860
I'd rather stay.

03:12.895 --> 03:14.664
EMMERICH:
This is a courtesy to Ms. Gold.

03:14.699 --> 03:15.962
We need to speak to her alone.

03:15.997 --> 03:17.799
I'd rather he stay.

03:18.902 --> 03:21.539
Authorities are still unable
to locate the armed man

03:21.574 --> 03:23.739
who targeted your father
and killed Frank Landau.

03:23.774 --> 03:26.511
We also don't believe
this is an isolated event.

03:26.546 --> 03:27.941
What does that mean?

03:27.976 --> 03:29.844
Well, the ballistics
and the manner of the shooting

03:29.879 --> 03:32.319
fit a pattern of other shootings
carried out by Totenkopf USA.

03:32.354 --> 03:35.454
-"Totenkopf"?
-It's a white supremacist group.

03:35.489 --> 03:37.786
They take the name from
one of Hitler's elite units.

03:37.821 --> 03:40.019
PLUMMER:
We're here to suggest
you take precautions.

03:40.054 --> 03:42.560
(snorts) Such as what?
Stop being Jewish?

03:42.595 --> 03:44.892
This isn't funny, Ms. Gold.

03:44.927 --> 03:45.826
No shit.

03:45.862 --> 03:47.334
That's how she deals
with serious things.

03:47.369 --> 03:48.797
She-she jokes.

03:48.832 --> 03:50.799
We advise that you vary
your route to and from work.

03:50.834 --> 03:52.636
Notice any strange vehicles
parked near your home.

03:52.671 --> 03:54.066
I'll check the street
and the lot.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.673
We've been monitoring
the chatter of the Totenkopf.

03:56.708 --> 03:58.906
They have talked about
wearing green shoelaces.

03:58.941 --> 04:00.908
So I should look
for green shoelaces?

04:00.943 --> 04:03.713
If you see anyone following you,
or anyone suspicious,

04:03.748 --> 04:05.484
you should call us.

04:05.519 --> 04:07.354
Put these numbers
in your phone.

04:07.389 --> 04:08.982
We'll stay in touch.

04:11.525 --> 04:13.525
(door opens)

04:14.121 --> 04:15.923
(door closes)

04:15.958 --> 04:17.430
(sighs)

04:17.465 --> 04:19.861
You all right?

04:22.668 --> 04:24.734
I want to buy a gun.

04:24.769 --> 04:26.406
We start with podcasts,

04:26.441 --> 04:28.672
but the goal is to finance
two limited series a year.

04:28.707 --> 04:30.839
That's great.

04:30.874 --> 04:33.875
Give me two weeks
to gather my best cases.

04:33.910 --> 04:34.943
Perfect.

04:34.978 --> 04:37.747
Uh, I do have a smaller issue,
if you don't mind.

04:37.782 --> 04:39.012
Uh, of course.
Uh, should we sit down?

04:39.047 --> 04:41.520
No, no, no, no.
This won't take long.

04:41.555 --> 04:43.555
So, I got these papers
from my wife.

04:43.590 --> 04:45.689
Oh, no, I'm-I'm sorry--

04:45.724 --> 04:47.592
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
we're happy.

04:47.627 --> 04:49.088
Yeah, this is not a divorce.
Um...

04:49.123 --> 04:51.090
Morgan's five months
pregnant now.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.026
And, uh, well,
she wants me to sign

04:53.061 --> 04:55.732
this thing
called a "push-nup."

04:55.767 --> 04:56.997
Uh, you mean a "postnup"?

04:57.032 --> 04:59.032
No. "Push-nup."

04:59.067 --> 05:01.067
Apparently, it's slang

05:01.102 --> 05:03.641
for an agreement
between prospective parents.

05:03.676 --> 05:05.379
You pay your wife
to have a baby?

05:05.414 --> 05:06.644
CARTER:
As she says,

05:06.679 --> 05:08.943
it's her body,
it's her morning sickness,

05:08.978 --> 05:11.979
and she's undercutting
her own career

05:12.014 --> 05:14.619
by taking time off
to raise the child.

05:14.654 --> 05:17.083
So Morgan says
marriage gets a contract,

05:17.118 --> 05:18.524
so why shouldn't motherhood?

05:18.559 --> 05:20.625
Well, I can think of
a few reasons.

05:20.660 --> 05:22.055
I don't mind signing

05:22.090 --> 05:24.761
a piece of paper or two--
you know, if it makes her happy.

05:24.796 --> 05:28.567
She... she is so afraid
of giving up her life.

05:28.602 --> 05:30.536
Understood.
I suggest we use

05:30.571 --> 05:32.164
a time-honored legal tactic.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.507
We stall.

05:34.542 --> 05:35.739
Send her lawyer over.

05:35.774 --> 05:37.972
(elevator bell dings)

05:41.879 --> 05:44.451
Are you getting off?

05:44.486 --> 05:46.585
ELSBETH:
What does that say?

05:46.620 --> 05:49.720
Uh... "BUB."

05:49.755 --> 05:51.755
What does that mean?

05:51.790 --> 05:53.493
I think it's an acronym.

05:53.528 --> 05:56.463
Ah, I think you're right.

05:56.498 --> 05:59.400
Are you going up or down?

06:01.470 --> 06:04.471
That depends on the day.

06:04.506 --> 06:06.902
I'm going down.

06:06.937 --> 06:07.837
Oh...

06:07.872 --> 06:09.905
Oh, I like that color on you.

06:09.940 --> 06:11.610
Thank you?

06:14.978 --> 06:17.616
-May I help you?
-Uh, Elsbeth Tascioni.

06:17.651 --> 06:19.717
I'm here for Mr. Lane.
Richard Lane.

06:19.752 --> 06:23.149
-Oh, uh, "Ri'Chard."
-(gasps) Yes. Oh, sorry.

06:23.184 --> 06:24.986
Ri'Chard.

06:26.924 --> 06:28.528
Do you want a paperweight?

06:28.563 --> 06:29.661
What?

06:29.696 --> 06:32.565
I started, um...

06:32.600 --> 06:34.864
blowing glass
during the pandemic.

06:34.899 --> 06:37.064
Well, first, I baked sourdough,

06:37.099 --> 06:41.706
but then I gained
20 pounds, so...

06:41.741 --> 06:43.576
Here you go.

06:43.611 --> 06:46.711
I call this one "Winter Dream."

06:47.516 --> 06:48.680
JULIUS:
Elsbeth?

06:48.715 --> 06:51.617
Julius, how are you?

06:51.652 --> 06:53.047
-Good, good.
-(laughs)

06:53.082 --> 06:54.785
-Well, why are you here?
-Oh.

06:54.820 --> 06:58.052
Um, I am supposed to be

06:58.087 --> 07:01.220
in a meeting--
Here, this is for you.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.222
Oh. Thank you?

07:03.257 --> 07:04.927
What's that color called?

07:04.962 --> 07:07.897
Uh, I don't know.
Blue? (chuckles)

07:07.932 --> 07:10.999
No, blue is more...

07:13.267 --> 07:16.169
Could you point me
to Ri'Chard Lane's office?

07:16.204 --> 07:17.775
Here.

07:17.810 --> 07:20.811
Oh. (claps hands) Perfect.

07:20.846 --> 07:23.209
Wow! Wait, this is your office?

07:23.244 --> 07:25.882
Uh, it is.
Um, how may I help you?

07:25.917 --> 07:28.115
Oh. I represent
Morgan Johnstone.

07:28.150 --> 07:31.789
Ah, yes.
The enigmatic "push-nup."

07:31.824 --> 07:33.087
(laughing):
Yeah.

07:33.122 --> 07:34.321
Good name, huh?

07:34.357 --> 07:37.663
Yes, all attempts to change
the law start with good names.

07:37.698 --> 07:39.159
(laughs)
Yeah.

07:39.194 --> 07:40.765
You're right.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.965
"Palimony."

07:43.000 --> 07:45.165
(gasps)
I hadn't thought of that.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.641
Uh, come on in.
Um, I'm here with Mr. Johnstone.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.203
ELSBETH:
Oh. Ooh.

07:53.780 --> 07:55.208
Wow, look at those screens.

07:55.243 --> 07:57.749
Do you have
movie nights in here?

07:57.784 --> 07:59.850
Uh, no, but, um, good idea.

07:59.885 --> 08:02.688
Uh, have you met
Mr. Johnstone before?

08:02.723 --> 08:04.558
-Oh. No. Hello.
-Hi.

08:04.593 --> 08:06.021
Ah, your wife is such a kick.

08:06.056 --> 08:08.661
Oh, thank you, yes, Ms.--
What is it again?

08:08.696 --> 08:10.025
-Tascioni.
-CARTER: Tascioni.

08:10.060 --> 08:12.060
Oh, and congratulations
on becoming a daddy.

08:12.095 --> 08:14.128
-(Carter chuckles)
-(laughs)

08:14.163 --> 08:16.196
And a piano.

08:16.231 --> 08:17.802
(gasps) Do you play?

08:17.837 --> 08:19.298
Uh, from time to time.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.334
And those glasses.
Ooh, those are wild.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.677
-Can I try those on?
-No.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.976
Um, what can we do for you?

08:27.011 --> 08:29.110
Oh.

08:29.145 --> 08:30.144
Here.

08:30.179 --> 08:33.884
I call this one
"Candy Floss."

08:33.919 --> 08:36.689
And... here...

08:36.724 --> 08:39.252
you... go.

08:39.287 --> 08:40.627
What is this?

08:40.662 --> 08:42.992
Copies of our estimates
for various stages

08:43.027 --> 08:44.829
of childbirth
and child-rearing.

08:44.864 --> 08:47.766
Uh, open to negotiation,
of course.

08:47.801 --> 08:48.965
Of course.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.605
Morgan wants to be fair.
So do I.

08:51.640 --> 08:53.838
You don't think this is all
a bit ridiculous, Ms. Tascioni?

08:53.873 --> 08:56.137
Uh, charging my client
for having a baby?

08:56.172 --> 08:59.272
-Ri'Chard, can I be
honest with you?
-Please.

08:59.307 --> 09:02.649
There is very little
in this world

09:02.684 --> 09:05.245
that I don't find ridiculous.

09:09.152 --> 09:10.822
(door opens)

09:13.893 --> 09:16.355
-(chuckles)
-Is she for real?

09:16.390 --> 09:17.895
Oh, I certainly hope so.

09:17.930 --> 09:20.062
I think we have
an opportunity here.

09:20.097 --> 09:22.229
If they want
to pursue a "push-nup,"

09:22.264 --> 09:25.265
let's use it
to open up the prenup, too.

09:25.300 --> 09:27.333
-The vacation house?
-Right.

09:27.368 --> 09:30.677
Your preexisting prenup
gives it to Morgan.

09:30.712 --> 09:34.340
Let's see what we can
shake loose from this lawyer.

09:34.375 --> 09:36.408
She seems, uh...

09:36.443 --> 09:38.212
easily confused.

09:38.247 --> 09:40.016
(beeps)

09:40.854 --> 09:42.348
Burgers!

09:45.694 --> 09:48.354
Malcolm! Dinner!

09:48.389 --> 09:50.928
(phone ringing)

09:55.330 --> 09:56.934
This is Liz Reddick.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.401
<i> WOMAN:</i>
<i> Hello?</i>

10:03.943 --> 10:05.679
This is Liz Reddick.
Who is this?

10:05.714 --> 10:07.912
<i> Virginia Thomas.</i>

10:09.113 --> 10:10.816
<i> V Ginni Thomas..</i>

10:14.019 --> 10:16.316
<i> and ask you</i>
<i> to consider apologizing</i>

-It seemed appropriate.
-(chuckles)

11:32.460 --> 11:35.230
We think a sliding scale,
starting at

11:35.265 --> 11:38.101
$30,000 an hour
for duration of labor...

11:38.136 --> 11:40.103
From first contraction?

11:40.138 --> 11:42.105
With another scale
for a Caesarean.

11:42.140 --> 11:44.239
That turns on contractual
lifestyle agreements,

11:44.274 --> 11:48.276
so I suggest we defer
to the prenup on that.

11:49.411 --> 11:52.544
You want to reopen the prenup?

11:52.579 --> 11:53.886
For simplicity's sake.

11:53.921 --> 11:54.953
What part of the prenup?

11:54.988 --> 11:59.419
Well, if Morgan has to be alone

11:59.454 --> 12:03.093
for an extended period
of time recovering,

12:03.128 --> 12:04.864
maybe we should
look at the agreement

12:04.899 --> 12:06.393
over the vacation home.

12:08.001 --> 12:10.133
Good. (exhales happily)

12:10.168 --> 12:13.037
We'd also love

12:13.072 --> 12:15.237

the earlier agreement

12:15.272 --> 12:17.536
on crypto investments.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.945
Why?

12:19.980 --> 12:21.507
Well, Mr. Johnstone's wealth

12:21.542 --> 12:23.476
has been invested heavily
in crypto.

12:23.511 --> 12:25.852
And that's been good
for both parties.

12:25.887 --> 12:28.250
(chuckling):
It certainly has.

12:28.285 --> 12:29.856
Not that I understand
all that stuff.

12:29.891 --> 12:34.454
But if we were to freeze
the value of that asset

12:34.489 --> 12:38.458
at its current level,
this would all be a lot easier.

12:38.493 --> 12:40.427
(scoffs)

12:40.462 --> 12:42.363
(chuckles)

12:43.201 --> 12:45.938
But if it drops,

12:45.973 --> 12:49.040
my client suffers a huge loss.

12:49.075 --> 12:50.602
But if it rises,

12:50.637 --> 12:53.572
and your client chooses
to divorce...

12:53.607 --> 12:56.410
he'll be even better off.

12:56.445 --> 12:58.984
So this push-nup is nonsense.

12:59.019 --> 13:02.548

I have a lawyer at reception.
Mr. Brittel?

28:13.130 --> 28:15.064
He says he represents the trust?

28:15.099 --> 28:18.166
Uh, do we know a lawyer
named Brittel?

28:18.201 --> 28:21.070
Oh, my God, are you serious?
Is he actually here?

28:21.105 --> 28:22.335
Hello, everyone.

28:22.370 --> 28:24.909
I'm here
to negotiate for my client.

28:24.944 --> 28:26.240
Matt, you don't represent me.

28:26.275 --> 28:27.472
We've already settled
our differences here.

28:27.507 --> 28:29.045
You're right,
I don't represent you.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.816
I represent
the unborn baby, Annie--

28:30.851 --> 28:32.048
-Audrey.
-BRITTEL: Exactly.

28:32.083 --> 28:34.116
This was never
a two-way negotiation.

28:34.151 --> 28:35.854
This is a three-way.

28:35.889 --> 28:37.350
-With a fetus?
-BRITTEL: Yes.

28:37.385 --> 28:41.222
And this fetus has one tough
motherfuckin' lawyer.

28:46.031 --> 28:48.229
<i> (thunder rumbling)</i>

28:49.870 --> 28:53.971
There will be no more borrowing
against the trust.

28:54.006 --> 28:55.500
This has nothing
to do with the trust.

28:55.535 --> 28:57.304
Mr. Johnstone has borrowed

28:57.339 --> 29:01.847
$895,000
for his crypto speculation.

29:01.882 --> 29:06.247
We expect that to be repaid
in full with interest.

29:06.282 --> 29:08.854
-1.6 million.
-You put us into debt?

29:08.889 --> 29:11.021
Well, you're not off the hook,
either. I've heard that

29:11.056 --> 29:12.924
you've requested money

29:12.959 --> 29:16.257
to compensate for the trauma
and inconvenience of childbirth.

29:16.292 --> 29:19.425
Well, it's only fair that
Audrey gets half of that.

29:19.460 --> 29:21.130
On what grounds?

29:21.165 --> 29:22.329
Well, birth is
at least as traumatic

29:22.364 --> 29:23.968
to the baby,
wouldn't you agree?

29:24.003 --> 29:25.937
-Who has hired you?
-The grandparents.

29:25.972 --> 29:28.005
They put the money
into the trust

29:28.040 --> 29:30.139
and they want it
to go directly to the child.

29:30.174 --> 29:32.570
Not to you.
So, see you in court.

29:32.605 --> 29:35.441
Oh, I don't think
she's going anywhere.

29:38.413 --> 29:42.151
I don't see how, legally--
how, logically--

29:42.186 --> 29:43.416
he can represent Audrey.

29:43.451 --> 29:45.253
It's a generation-skipping
trust.

29:45.288 --> 29:47.222
The grandfather didn't want
to give the money to them.

29:47.257 --> 29:49.257
He wanted it to go
to their children.

29:49.292 --> 29:52.458
-But the child isn't born yet.
-Right, so...

29:52.493 --> 29:55.329
let's sue the fetus.

29:55.964 --> 29:58.497
She-she doesn't have standing,
not yet.

29:58.532 --> 30:00.169

32:58.283 --> 33:01.482
Uh, Your Honor, as my colleague
has already pointed out,

33:01.517 --> 33:03.517
there is no "child"
in this case.

33:03.552 --> 33:05.618
I'm going to allow the term.

33:14.860 --> 33:18.433
Uh, Your Honor,
our client, Mr. Johnstone,

33:18.468 --> 33:21.337
has requested
a declaratory judgment

33:21.372 --> 33:25.341
stating that he is under
no legal obligation

33:25.376 --> 33:27.739
to pay for childbirth
or mothering services,

33:27.774 --> 33:31.743
whether the compensation goes
to Ms. Johnstone

33:31.778 --> 33:33.382
or to "the child."

33:33.417 --> 33:35.648
I never expected you
to use this hearing

33:35.683 --> 33:38.090

negotiating position.

33:38.125 --> 33:39.256
Seize the day.

33:39.291 --> 33:41.192
He also contends
that such payments--

33:41.227 --> 33:44.129
in addition to contravening
natural and biblical law--

33:44.164 --> 33:46.791
-Amen!

the Bible doesn't support

33:56.572 --> 33:57.736
this kind of abandonment.

33:57.771 --> 33:59.144
BRITTEL:
Your Honor, you see, this is

33:59.179 --> 34:00.145
exactly why the child needs me

34:00.180 --> 34:01.542

My name is Randy Elkin.
I'm an attorney.

35:23.395 --> 35:25.890
The man you're arresting is
a private investigator,

35:25.925 --> 35:27.265
licensed to carry weapons.

35:27.300 --> 35:29.564

a federal agent.
