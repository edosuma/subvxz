He was the chief engineer
at the plant for 20 years.

14:36.389 --> 14:38.557
He was dad's boss.

14:39.692 --> 14:42.127
He's been holed up in the
woods since the apocalypse.

14:42.162 --> 14:44.263
He's armed and dangerous.

14:44.297 --> 14:46.965
He became a recluse after
the death of his son.

14:47.801 --> 14:50.369

14:50.403 --> 14:51.970

15:08.154 --> 15:09.221

15:09.956 --> 15:11.623
We're still fifty yards away.

15:11.658 --> 15:13.458
My dad said the place was booby-trapped.

15:13.493 --> 15:15.327
I told you, Homer's crazy.

15:15.361 --> 15:17.930
Have we completely dismissed
the idea of a phone call?

15:17.964 --> 15:19.565
Just sayin'.

15:20.200 --> 15:20.933
Hey.

15:22.202 --> 15:25.037
This is your kinda set-up. How do we get in?

15:25.071 --> 15:29.174
Without us getting killed.
I do like to keep that in mind.

15:29.542 --> 15:30.676
Uh, well one thing.

15:30.710 --> 15:33.378
Homer's set-up is aimed at stopping Zs,
not a team. So

15:33.413 --> 15:36.982
if we keep a sharp eye out for landmines,
trip wires...

15:37.016 --> 15:38.450
We'll be fine.

15:40.587 --> 15:41.553
Okay.

15:43.256 --> 15:45.224

15:45.258 --> 15:47.059
Give us a 40 second head start.

15:47.093 --> 15:49.261
We'll flank him and come up from behind.

16:09.315 --> 16:10.616
Okay, watch for mines.

16:46.786 --> 16:48.820
Just don't leave me a Z.

16:49.188 --> 16:50.923

16:50.957 --> 16:52.457
We just need your help.

16:52.825 --> 16:54.993
Hello to you too.

17:01.534 --> 17:03.535
Grady was a good man.

17:03.937 --> 17:06.972
If anyone could SCRAM that reactor

17:07.941 --> 17:09.942
it was him.

17:10.108 --> 17:11.410
SCRAM?

17:11.444 --> 17:14.746
Safety Control Rod Axe Man.

17:14.781 --> 17:16.982
Goes back to the first reactors.

17:17.016 --> 17:21.920
The only safety system they had
was literally a man with an axe

17:21.954 --> 17:25.257
whose whole job in the event of a meltdown

17:25.290 --> 17:29.294
was to cut the rope holding
fuel rods over the cooling pool.

17:29.329 --> 17:31.363
That's what dad was trying to do.

17:31.397 --> 17:32.731

17:32.765 --> 17:33.999
How much time do we have?

17:34.033 --> 17:35.467
You're in the soup with us, Homer.

17:35.501 --> 17:38.136
You've confused me with
someone who gives a damn.

17:38.171 --> 17:41.073
According to Grady, less than 40 hours.

17:41.107 --> 17:42.641
And we do give a damn.

17:42.675 --> 17:44.176
Now are you gonna help us

17:44.210 --> 17:47.479
or are you gonna sit
here and let us all die?

17:49.282 --> 17:52.851
Well there's one thing we might try.

17:53.219 --> 17:55.554
I'm gonna have to show you.

17:58.157 --> 18:00.993
We're gonna need weapons, equipment.

20:46.726 --> 20:48.226
Let's do this.

20:48.261 --> 21:00.071
<i>[industrial motors running]</i>

21:00.106 --> 21:01.139
[snarling]

21:01.174 --> 21:01.840
[gunshot]

21:04.210 --> 21:07.012
We made it to the control room.

21:10.750 --> 21:13.818
And there's our problem. Cooling pool three.

21:13.853 --> 21:15.654
Can you SCRAM it or not?

21:15.688 --> 21:18.823
According to the controls,
all the rods are enabled

21:18.858 --> 21:22.727
but something is physically
blocking the insertion.

21:22.762 --> 21:24.062
We need to remove it.

21:24.096 --> 21:25.130
By hand?

21:27.833 --> 21:29.401
Not by our hand.

21:35.675 --> 21:37.075
This is Robbie.

21:37.109 --> 21:40.345
He will roll into the core
and do a manual SCRAM.

21:40.379 --> 21:42.714
He can cut through anything.

21:42.748 --> 21:46.117
This little darlin' can vaporize steel.

21:49.622 --> 21:50.755
I get it.

21:50.790 --> 21:51.790
It's like a drone.

21:52.191 --> 21:54.626
Only he never leaves the ground.

22:08.507 --> 22:10.208

22:10.243 --> 22:11.109
Back it up, Homer.

22:11.143 --> 22:12.477
I'll do the driving.

22:12.511 --> 22:15.347
We need to go forward.

22:50.583 --> 22:51.716
Leave.

23:00.559 --> 23:02.527
We lost Robbie.

23:06.277 --> 23:07.845
So what now?

23:07.879 --> 23:10.180
Plan B or is it C?

23:10.215 --> 23:13.050
- Give me a D, E, F.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

23:13.084 --> 23:13.951
Not helpful.

23:13.985 --> 23:15.452
[alarm sounding]

23:15.487 --> 23:18.155
All right. Robbie failed.

23:18.189 --> 23:20.491
But I can still do a manual SCRAM.

23:20.525 --> 23:22.926
How? That place is filled with Zs.

23:22.961 --> 23:24.695
We'll go in heavier.

23:24.729 --> 23:26.296
Take <i> us</i> along this time.

23:26.331 --> 23:29.600
We probably only got one
more shot at a SCRAM.

23:30.335 --> 23:32.836
But we'll need heavier suits
to reach the control room.

23:32.871 --> 23:34.304
Where do we find them?

23:35.140 --> 23:38.709
In the lab,
not far from where we lost Robbie.

23:38.743 --> 23:41.078
Four can go in, two in these suits.

23:41.112 --> 23:42.813
Me and the kid in the heavies.

23:42.847 --> 23:43.781
Okay.

23:43.815 --> 23:46.016
But what happens if plan C doesn't work

23:46.050 --> 23:49.753
and we wind up with our very own
Fukushima Chernobyl whatever?

23:50.288 --> 23:51.588
You mean what happens to you?

23:51.623 --> 23:52.689
Hey.

23:52.724 --> 23:55.025
I didn't ask for the job
of saving the human race.

23:56.027 --> 23:57.227
Amelia.

23:57.262 --> 24:00.597
Would you be willing to fly
him out of the radiation zone?

24:00.632 --> 24:01.465
[alarm continues]

24:01.833 --> 24:02.933
To be honest,

24:03.334 --> 24:04.501
I don't have enough fuel.

24:04.536 --> 24:05.502
I lied to my dad

24:05.537 --> 24:07.271
or else he never would
have let me stay behind.

24:07.305 --> 24:08.906
Oh great.

24:08.940 --> 24:10.574
If I had a few gallons,

24:10.608 --> 24:12.409
I might be able to get
myself and one other person

24:12.444 --> 24:14.711
outside the blast zone, if we are lucky.

24:17.148 --> 24:20.651
Okay, a buddy and I once
converted a Dodge Dart

24:20.685 --> 24:21.985
to run on alcohol.

24:22.020 --> 24:24.721
A light plane engine isn't that different.

24:24.756 --> 24:26.457
You had a serious supply of vodka.

24:26.891 --> 24:28.425
You're welcome to it.

24:28.927 --> 24:30.194
Okay.

24:30.495 --> 24:31.895
Doc and Cassandra,

24:31.930 --> 24:34.398

24:34.432 --> 24:36.300
Murphy and Amelia, come with me.

24:36.701 --> 24:38.469
Given we have no other choices,

flaw in this ugly world.

So Amelia, my dear.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.234

Considering it's only <i> my life</i>

25:32.608 --> 25:34.008
Sheridan, Wyoming.

25:34.043 --> 25:34.909
It's to the northwest,

25:34.943 --> 25:36.911
and the fallout will be to the southeast.

25:36.945 --> 25:38.646
Far enough away, and

25:38.681 --> 25:41.516
my dad and I heard there's some real humans.

25:42.051 --> 25:43.251
I just hope it works.

25:43.619 --> 25:46.454
Piece of cake. All I need is some tools.

25:49.758 --> 25:52.627
Murphy, could you quit drinking your fuel

25:52.661 --> 25:53.961
and fill up the damn tank?

25:54.496 --> 25:56.431
I don't know where the tank is.

25:56.465 --> 25:58.566
Well it's not in your mouth.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.735
Let me get a screwdriver.

26:09.845 --> 26:12.747
Okay, so that was 22 gallons.

26:12.781 --> 26:15.717
Sheridan is 250 miles as the crow flies.

26:15.751 --> 26:17.852
Here's a couple more.

26:17.886 --> 26:20.188
Is that gonna be far enough
to clear the blast zone?

26:20.222 --> 26:21.656
It'll have to be.

26:21.690 --> 26:25.259

28:15.637 --> 28:18.372
Hey, if we find more fuel in Billings,

we could take off again
and head to California.

34:14.501 --> 34:16.101
I was probably a dead man

34:16.136 --> 34:18.003
the moment I walked through the gate.

34:18.605 --> 34:20.371
There's got to be something I can do.

34:23.576 --> 34:25.210
Aren't you gonna add to your count?

34:27.414 --> 34:29.848
Two thousand three hundred and sixteen.

34:31.184 --> 34:38.824
You know you're a good kid,
strong, smart, like my son Max.

34:38.858 --> 34:41.493
I just hope to God you have better luck.

34:42.062 --> 34:44.063
You're a lot like my dad too.

34:46.065 --> 34:48.233
With the same bad luck.

34:49.902 --> 34:52.905
You need to go on for all of us.

34:52.938 --> 34:54.239
Promise me that.

34:55.074 --> 34:57.576
Live the life

34:57.610 --> 34:59.912
my son never had.

34:59.946 --> 35:03.449
<i>(Alarm) Warning, system overload.</i>

35:03.483 --> 35:05.250
We need to get up there.

35:11.791 --> 35:16.462
<i>[alarm continues]</i>

35:16.496 --> 35:18.797
Time really is a waistin'.

35:18.832 --> 35:20.532
Let's get to it.

35:22.001 --> 35:23.569
There's our problem.

35:23.603 --> 35:25.704
Two rods didn't go down.

35:25.738 --> 35:29.575
<i>(Radio) I'm gonna have to go
out there and unstick those rods.</i>

35:29.609 --> 35:32.478
<i>Be careful not to drop
me into the reactor pool.</i>

35:32.512 --> 35:34.480
<i>I'll be cooked instantly.</i>

35:35.181 --> 35:36.815
We shouldn't have left them alone.

35:36.850 --> 35:37.749
<i>(Radio) Got it.</i>

35:37.784 --> 35:38.617
<i>[alarm continues]</i>

35:38.651 --> 35:40.986
We couldn't stay. We were at our limits.

35:41.020 --> 35:43.455
That thing goes off and limits won't matter.

35:43.823 --> 35:45.958
Homer knows what he's doing.

35:46.860 --> 35:48.093
And the kid is awesome.

35:48.595 --> 35:50.195
<i>(Radio) Here I go.</i>

35:50.230 --> 35:52.965
<i>[alarm continues]</i>

35:52.999 --> 35:54.833
Can you get me closer?

35:54.868 --> 35:56.068
Yeah, sorry.

35:58.037 --> 36:02.074
I thought everybody your age
was a whiz with a remote.

36:02.108 --> 36:03.375
Not me.

36:03.409 --> 36:06.078
Lower me a little more.

36:08.181 --> 36:10.449
Can you get me a little closer?

36:15.255 --> 36:16.488
Okay.

36:16.523 --> 36:19.224
Now hit the switch that says claw release.

36:19.259 --> 36:29.535
<i>[multiple loud alarms sounding]</i>

36:29.569 --> 36:31.136
One down.

36:31.171 --> 36:33.472
<i>(Alarm) Evacuate. Evacuate.</i>

36:33.506 --> 36:36.341
Once this is fixed,

36:36.376 --> 36:39.011
shoot me and get out.

36:39.045 --> 36:42.481
I don't want to become one of them.

36:45.118 --> 36:55.160
[snarling]

36:55.162 --> 37:02.034
[snarling]

37:03.036 --> 37:05.404
If I haven't said anything lately,

37:05.939 --> 37:07.506
thank you

37:07.540 --> 37:09.174
so much,

37:09.209 --> 37:10.742
universe.

37:10.777 --> 37:14.012
For the Zombie Apocalypse!

37:14.047 --> 37:16.515
<i>[snarling continues]</i>

37:16.549 --> 37:19.084
And for Doctor Merch and my whole

37:19.118 --> 37:21.486
situation!

37:21.521 --> 37:24.356
And for, well I don't know,
let's see, what else.

37:24.390 --> 37:27.092
The Badlands Nuclear Power Plant!

37:27.126 --> 37:28.460
And yes!

37:28.494 --> 37:30.696
Points to you, universe!

37:30.730 --> 37:33.298
Points to you for dragging my ass

37:33.333 --> 37:37.703
all the way to South Dakota to die!

37:37.737 --> 37:40.572
<i>[snarling continues]</i>

37:40.607 --> 37:43.976
That was sarcasm.

37:44.010 --> 37:50.082
<i>[snarling continues]</i>

37:50.116 --> 37:52.317
I am not like other boys.

37:52.352 --> 37:54.553
I do not give mercy.

37:54.587 --> 37:55.487
[snarling continues]

37:55.521 --> 37:56.588
Go home!

37:56.623 --> 38:00.192
<i>[snarling continues]</i>

38:00.226 --> 38:02.261
I don't have anything for you!

38:03.196 --> 38:06.932
Can't you find somebody to munch on?

38:06.966 --> 38:09.067
[snarling continues]

38:09.902 --> 38:12.738
Oh God,

38:12.772 --> 38:15.173
really is puppies and kittens.

38:15.208 --> 38:22.914
[snarling continues]

38:23.249 --> 38:24.349
Two...

38:24.784 --> 38:25.751
more...

38:25.918 --> 38:27.819
inches.

38:31.791 --> 38:34.092
Now hit the claw release again.

38:34.127 --> 38:40.165
<i>[multiple loud alarms sounding]</i>

38:40.199 --> 38:42.868
[muffled] Almost... there.

38:42.902 --> 38:45.537
<i>[multiple loud alarms continue]</i>

38:45.571 --> 38:49.107
<i>(Alarm) Temperature normalizing.</i>

38:49.142 --> 38:50.075
Homer, it worked.

38:50.843 --> 38:52.611
How about that?

38:52.645 --> 38:53.945
We did good.

38:54.247 --> 38:56.248
All right, now let me get you out of there.

38:56.282 --> 38:57.916
Shoot me now.

39:01.554 --> 39:04.823
I already killed my father.
I don't want to kill you.

39:05.191 --> 39:07.659
You don't make it easy.

39:07.694 --> 39:09.861
No, no, no! No, no, no! No!

39:11.431 --> 39:13.565
[screaming] No!

39:22.775 --> 39:25.777
[snarling]

39:34.797 --> 39:36.498
Here he comes.

39:43.773 --> 39:46.574
(Doc) Hey, kid! Wait! Wait up!

39:46.609 --> 39:47.909
(Cassandra) Homer saved us!

39:47.943 --> 39:49.644
That's right. He saved the whole town!

39:49.679 --> 39:51.513
It's not that!

39:52.715 --> 39:54.616
I couldn't save him.

39:54.950 --> 39:57.752
I know, I know. We heard.

40:00.556 --> 40:02.290
You did everything you could.

40:02.324 --> 40:04.159
You gave him mercy.

40:07.396 --> 40:10.098
You remind me of my ex-wife,
back from Costco.

40:10.633 --> 40:12.200
Who'd marry you?

40:13.069 --> 40:15.670
Several women, I'll have you know.

40:15.705 --> 40:17.839
None with very good taste

40:17.873 --> 40:19.841
or staying power.

40:19.875 --> 40:21.342
So it all worked.

40:21.377 --> 40:22.744
We're safe.

40:22.778 --> 40:24.646
From the meltdown.

40:24.680 --> 40:26.648
Nothing else.

40:29.418 --> 40:30.885
Is this a battery charger?

40:31.987 --> 40:34.422
Yeah. I couldn't find a
truck that I could fix,

40:34.457 --> 40:35.690
so that'll keep us going.

40:36.158 --> 40:39.194
All right, so we can get back on the trail.
But where to?

40:39.228 --> 40:41.863
Given the fact that we've lost patient zero.

40:45.501 --> 40:47.102
Great news!

40:47.136 --> 40:49.404
The vodka made perfect fuel

40:49.438 --> 40:50.905
for ten minutes!

40:50.940 --> 40:52.207
What happened?

40:52.241 --> 40:53.875
Crash landing

40:53.909 --> 40:55.643
about a hundred miles out of town.

40:55.678 --> 40:57.312
Wow, you covered a lot of ground.

40:57.346 --> 40:58.046
Did you hitchhike?

40:58.080 --> 40:59.280
Ten miles, whatever.

40:59.315 --> 41:02.183
It felt like a hundred
miles when you're walking.

41:03.619 --> 41:05.153
So what happened to Amelia?

41:07.556 --> 41:09.524
[snarling]

41:09.925 --> 41:10.892
Oh no.

41:11.127 --> 41:12.527
You didn't give her mercy?

41:12.995 --> 41:14.395
It didn't feel right, somehow.

41:14.663 --> 41:17.031
So you just let her follow you?

41:17.833 --> 41:21.770
That... felt... right, somehow.

41:23.405 --> 41:25.273
Okay, what do you want us to do?

41:25.307 --> 41:27.809
No, no! No, no, no, no, no! No!

41:27.843 --> 41:29.244
No!

41:30.045 --> 41:32.914
She is not hurting us!

41:33.983 --> 41:35.116
I don't know.

41:36.085 --> 41:38.653
Maybe it's time for a
different kind of mercy.

41:45.327 --> 41:47.095
[snarling]

41:48.063 --> 41:49.464
[whispering] Okay.

41:50.633 --> 41:52.767
Climb aboard.
