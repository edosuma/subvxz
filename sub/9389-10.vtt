WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:08.425
(SINGING) It seems today that all you see
is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:08.509 --> 00:11.678
But where are those
good old-fashioned values

00:11.762 --> 00:14.848
ALL: On which we used to rely?

00:14.932 --> 00:18.477
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.560 --> 00:21.939
Lucky there's a man who
positively can do

00:22.022 --> 00:23.440
All the things that make us

00:23.524 --> 00:24.816
Laugh and cry!

00:24.900 --> 00:30.113
ALL: He's a family guy!

00:34.952 --> 00:37.162
Check it out, guys,
new driver's license.

00:37.246 --> 00:38.705
What's wrong with
your picture?

00:38.789 --> 00:41.041
Well, see, I got drunk
and then got my picture taken,

00:41.124 --> 00:43.126
so that way when I get pulled
over for drunk driving,

00:43.210 --> 00:45.295
I look the same
as on my license.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.922
You know, and then the copper'll say,

00:47.005 --> 00:48.090
"Oh, you're fine,
you're not drunk.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.592
"This is you normal.
I can tell by the picture."

00:50.676 --> 00:51.927
I wish I'd thought of that.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.179
I just got my new
license a month ago.

00:56.598 --> 00:57.808
What's with the big grin?

00:57.891 --> 00:59.977
Oh, I had just gotten a
new tube of Aquafresh,

01:00.060 --> 01:02.020
and I was feeling cocky.

01:02.104 --> 01:05.065
Hey, let's see yours, Quagmire.

01:05.148 --> 01:07.609
Wait a second,
you were born in 1948?

01:07.693 --> 01:08.694
Uh, yeah.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.320
You're 61 years old?

01:10.404 --> 01:11.405
Uh, yes, sir.

01:11.488 --> 01:12.489
What's your secret?

01:12.573 --> 01:14.074
Uh, carrots.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.910
Sometimes I grind 'em up into
juice or just eat 'em raw...

01:16.994 --> 01:18.412
or insert them anally.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.248
Long as I get 'em
into my body somehow.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.208
Chicka-chickah.

01:23.292 --> 01:26.295
ANNOUNCER: And now back to
the Fox News Report with Rhonda Latimer.

01:26.378 --> 01:29.923
Oh, God, that new Fox News
reporter is so freaking hot.

01:30.007 --> 01:32.009
Good evening,
I'm Rhonda Latimer for Fox News.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.927
Here are tonight's top stories.

01:34.011 --> 01:36.471
Oh, she is just
so smoking hot.

01:36.555 --> 01:39.308
God, I would do things
to her that...

01:39.391 --> 01:41.185
she would probably
laugh at.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.436
You bitch!

01:45.689 --> 01:47.357
Change it to Fox News.
It's time for Rhonda Latimer.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.860
-(SIGHS)
-...and we also want to remind you

01:49.943 --> 01:52.779
that Fox News switches to
high-definition starting Monday.

01:52.863 --> 01:55.365
Aw, crap, does this mean
we got to get a new TV?

01:55.449 --> 01:56.658
Looks that way.

01:56.742 --> 01:59.578
Great, I need another expense
like I need a hole in the head,

01:59.661 --> 02:00.704
and I don't need that.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.331
I'm telling you,
this thing has turned out

02:02.414 --> 02:03.582
to be nothing but a burden.

02:03.665 --> 02:04.833
Oh, my God, Peter!

02:04.917 --> 02:06.293
When did you get that?

02:06.376 --> 02:08.295
Ah, a few of the fellas
at work talked me into it,

02:08.378 --> 02:09.463
said it was something
I might need.

02:09.546 --> 02:10.839
It's horrible.

02:10.923 --> 02:12.132
And the worst thing is,

02:12.216 --> 02:14.218
I found out I got it
on the gay side.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.761
Hey, are you coming out
tonight?

02:15.844 --> 02:18.096
I'm not gay, they put the
hole on the wrong side.

02:21.058 --> 02:23.101
All right, family, the wait is over.

02:23.227 --> 02:26.230
I give you high-def television.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.398
Ooh, can I have the box?

02:28.482 --> 02:31.401
Look at me, I'm an Iraq War vet
in ten years.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.237
No, we're going
to take good care of them.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.321
(REMOTE CLICKS)

02:34.446 --> 02:36.323
Wow, look at that HD picture.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.741
Yeah, it's so clear,

02:37.824 --> 02:40.160
you can even see
Ellen DeGeneres' breath.

02:40.244 --> 02:42.663
Well, my guest today
is, uh, Seth Rogen,

02:42.746 --> 02:44.248
who's got a
new movie out.

02:44.331 --> 02:46.583
Now, Seth, this movie is hot.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.253
It's just hot, hot, hot.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.922
How does it feel to have the
hottest film in Hollywood?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.757
What the (BLEEP)?

02:56.927 --> 03:00.347
And now, the real reason
to have an HDTV.

03:00.472 --> 03:03.600
TV ANNOUNCER: And now, the Fox News
6:00 report with Rhonda Latimer.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.477
In high-definition.

03:05.561 --> 03:07.396
Good evening, everyone,
and I hope you're as thrilled

03:07.479 --> 03:09.898
about the new format change
as I am.

03:09.982 --> 03:11.358
ALL: Aah!

03:11.441 --> 03:12.734
-Aah!
-Aah!

03:12.818 --> 03:14.069
-Aah!
-Aah!

03:14.194 --> 03:15.237
-Aah!
-Aah!

03:15.320 --> 03:17.197
-Oh, no.
-JEFFREY: I know.

03:17.281 --> 03:18.282
Oh...

03:18.448 --> 03:20.033
Aah...

03:20.117 --> 03:22.911
I'll get all of the "A"s
out of my body.

03:22.995 --> 03:26.540
Aah...

03:26.707 --> 03:28.834
We interrupt this report
to inform you

03:28.917 --> 03:32.087
Rhonda Latimer has been
relocated to Guantanamo Bay.

03:32.171 --> 03:35.090
Coming up, the new format
that makes HD obsolete.

03:35.174 --> 03:36.717
PETER: Son of a bitch!

03:41.388 --> 03:44.933
Mom, do you ever feel...
not so fresh down there?

03:45.017 --> 03:46.768
No, there must be
something wrong with you.

03:46.852 --> 03:47.853
Really?

03:47.936 --> 03:49.897
Yeah, I've never
had that problem

03:49.980 --> 03:51.440
and I don't know
any woman who has.

03:51.523 --> 03:52.816
Hey, look at this.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.693
Fox News is looking
for a replacement

03:54.776 --> 03:55.777
for Rhonda Latimer.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.404
Hey, Mom,
you should try out.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.906
I mean,
you majored in journalism

03:58.989 --> 04:00.407
and you've never done
anything with it.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.160
Well, I did write
for my college newspaper.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.494
Yeah, didn't you do an interview

04:04.578 --> 04:06.038
with that fast-talking FedEx guy?

04:06.163 --> 04:08.707
Yeah, I ended up dating him
for three months.

04:08.874 --> 04:09.917
That's a beautiful shade
of lipstick.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.001
I bet you enjoy
the music of Men At Work.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.336
You're incredibly foxy,
take off your shirt,

04:12.419 --> 04:14.004
take off your pants. Wow,
what a body, that feels good.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.297
I'll give you a call.
You'd better get tested.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.424
Yeah, Mom,
you should be a reporter.

04:17.508 --> 04:20.260
Well, I mean, I guess
there's no harm in trying out.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.845
Hey, Lois,
little less yakety-yak,

04:21.929 --> 04:23.347
little more cutting up
my banana.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.807
What am I supposed to do,
stick the whole thing in my mouth?

04:25.891 --> 04:27.267
I mean-- Oh, hello.

04:27.351 --> 04:28.810
Lois, you can't
possibly be considering

04:28.894 --> 04:30.020
working for Fox News.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.605
Well, why not?

04:31.688 --> 04:33.690
Why not? Because they're evil
and they distort the truth

04:33.774 --> 04:35.484
and they do the bidding
of the Republican Party.

04:35.567 --> 04:37.736
I mean, what other reasons
do you need?

04:37.819 --> 04:40.280
Don't listen to Brian, Lois.
You'd be great on camera,

04:40.364 --> 04:43.200
like I was when I played
that dead body on Law & Order...

04:43.283 --> 04:45.244
Well, until I got
that itch in my crotch.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.162
The contusion
on his left temple implies

04:47.246 --> 04:50.332
he was hit by a blunt object,
and the cuts imply a struggle.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.458
So it was murder.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.043
But the question is who?

04:53.126 --> 04:55.295
Well, whoever it was wears nail polish.

04:55.379 --> 04:56.713
We found traces in the wounds.

04:56.797 --> 04:57.881
Well, that narrows it down.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.383
At least we know it wasn't the father.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.802
Yeah, but we still
got to find out...

05:04.054 --> 05:07.599
PETER: Oh... thank God.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.732
All right, Fox News auditions,
take one.

05:15.816 --> 05:19.319
And even though this
Iraqi veteran lost his hands,

05:19.403 --> 05:22.030
he didn't lose his ability to feel.

05:22.114 --> 05:24.324
I'm Lois Griffin for Fox News.

05:24.408 --> 05:25.701
Great story, Lois.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.035
Thanks, I just made it up.

05:27.119 --> 05:29.121
You know, I've been doing
this job a long time,

05:29.204 --> 05:30.873
and I think
you've got what it takes.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.583
(CHUCKLING)
You're kidding, really?

05:32.666 --> 05:35.502
Yes, how would you like to be
our newest on-air reporter?

05:35.586 --> 05:37.129
Wow.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.463
You know, I came down here

05:38.547 --> 05:39.840
not even thinking I had a shot,

05:39.923 --> 05:42.551
and now you're telling me this.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.595
Gosh, it's an
awfully big decision.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.347
Lois, please,
take the job, for Fox sake.

05:47.431 --> 05:50.767
Well... all right, I'll do it.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.311
Great, here's your contract.

05:52.394 --> 05:55.981
Now, run home, Lois,
run as fast as you can.

06:37.189 --> 06:38.690
Well, do I look TV-ready?

06:38.774 --> 06:40.025
Lois, I can't believe
you're doing this.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.527
If you work for Fox News,

06:41.610 --> 06:42.945
you're going to be
selling your soul.

06:43.028 --> 06:44.279
Oh, Brian, come on.

06:44.363 --> 06:46.031
They're a major news network.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.908
I would think you'd be excited for me.

They're a lie factory.

they damn well please.

you're welcome to come with me

06:53.539 --> 06:55.541
and see for yourself
that it's all on the level.

06:55.624 --> 06:57.543
You know, I just might
take you up on that, Lois.

06:57.626 --> 06:59.962
And I know another way
we can take advantage of this.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.297
Chris, Meg, meet me in
the living room in ten minutes.

07:02.381 --> 07:03.382

07:05.425 --> 07:06.718

07:06.802 --> 07:09.221
Meg, now that Lois has
connections at Fox,

07:09.304 --> 07:11.974
we are going to invent
our own cartoon show.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.642
And we are here
to brainstorm ideas.

07:13.725 --> 07:14.726
All right, go.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.270
Anything that pops
into your head.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.772
Ooh, how about a show about
a bunch of disabled ducks

07:18.856 --> 07:20.691
and we'll call it Handi-Quacks?

07:20.774 --> 07:22.150

All right, let's spend
many hours on this.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.322

what's his name?

uh, Red Hiney Monkey?

07:34.246 --> 07:36.290
Meg, please try to formulate ideas

07:36.373 --> 07:38.083
clearly before you vocalize them.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.793
I'm not sure you're getting
the show, Meg.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.336

names, come on, now.

in the kitchen for a sec?

I don't think she's getting it.

she's not she's getting it, but...

07:54.725 --> 07:56.185
PETER: Shh, there's no but.
She's not getting it.

07:56.268 --> 07:57.936
-Well, what the hell do you want to do?
-She's poison.

07:58.020 --> 08:00.189
-Absolutely, she's dead weight.
-She doesn't understand.

08:00.272 --> 08:01.940
But without her,
the staff is too small.

08:02.024 --> 08:04.318
-I mean, she's just not funny.
-She's completely ruining it.

08:04.401 --> 08:07.029
Yeah, but I think it's important to have
a female perspective in the room.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.655
All right, well, then I think
we're gonna have to expect nothing.

08:08.739 --> 08:10.616
-Right.
-And then maybe be pleasantly surprised.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.409
Okay.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.164
Welcome to Fox News, Lois.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.665
We're very excited
to have you.

08:18.749 --> 08:20.959
Well, I'm excited to be here.

08:21.043 --> 08:22.753
Oh, this is my dog, Brian.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.796
He was just dying to see
the studio.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.089
Well, hi there, Brian.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.299
How's it going, Adolf?

They were there, though.

08:33.430 --> 08:36.433
This whole place just feels
like a warm blanket.

08:36.517 --> 08:38.268
I'll show you to our
day care facility shortly.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.145
But first,
let's have a look around.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.773
This is our control room,

08:42.856 --> 08:45.108
where we have the ability
to monitor up to 500 different

08:45.192 --> 08:46.652
news stories
in any given hour.

08:46.735 --> 08:47.861
What's that
big button do?

08:47.945 --> 08:49.446
Oh, that's kind of fun.

08:49.530 --> 08:52.324
It emits a noise that only
Al Gore can hear.

08:53.992 --> 08:55.536
There it is again!

08:55.619 --> 08:57.162
WOMAN: It's probably
just wind, honey.

08:57.246 --> 08:58.914
It's not the wind!

08:58.997 --> 09:00.958
And this is the kitchen.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.836
We've got all kinds of snacks
and cold drinks in here.

09:03.919 --> 09:05.087
I don't see
the refrigerator.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.755
Oh, we just use
Ann Coulter.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.969
Hmm... There's never
anything good in here.

09:14.847 --> 09:15.931
All right, here we go.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.850
Handi-Quacks, episode one, scene one.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.560
Let's get 'em laughing
right off the bat.

09:19.643 --> 09:20.811
Interior, Red Hiney Monkey's house.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.272
What's Red Hiney Monkey doing?

09:23.355 --> 09:27.109
Um, maybe he just got up,
he's making breakfast?

09:27.192 --> 09:28.777
Eh, I don't think people
eat breakfast anymore.

09:28.861 --> 09:30.571
More suggestions.

09:30.654 --> 09:33.240
Ooh, what if Red Hiney Monkey
and Poopyface Tomato Nose

09:33.323 --> 09:34.950
are trying to build
a house of cards,

09:35.033 --> 09:37.119
and it keeps falling down?

09:37.202 --> 09:39.621
Oh, Jiminy Christmas!
We have all been there.

09:39.705 --> 09:41.206
That's going in.

09:41.290 --> 09:43.458
Oh, we are cooking, cooking,
cooking, cooking now.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.377
All right, now let's take
a walk down this road,

09:45.460 --> 09:46.503
see where it leads us.

09:46.587 --> 09:47.671
Dialogue. What are they saying?

09:47.754 --> 09:50.674
Um, maybe
Poopyface Tomato Nose says, uh...

09:50.757 --> 09:54.511
"Boy, this house of cards
just doesn't want to stay up."

09:54.636 --> 09:56.430
Well, I mean, yeah,
if you want to go right at it

09:56.513 --> 09:57.973
like a Neanderthal, sure,
but I think we're

09:58.056 --> 09:59.892
shooting for a little more
subtlety here, you know.

09:59.975 --> 10:01.935
You know, I don't...
I don't believe that.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.437
I don't believe that that's

10:03.520 --> 10:05.063
a real conversation
when I hear it.

10:05.147 --> 10:06.690
People don't talk like that, Meg.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.318
Ooh! Ooh! What if they just
bought a new wood stove,

10:09.401 --> 10:11.987
and Red Hiney Monkey says,
"Boy, it's so hot in here

10:12.070 --> 10:14.740
"because we just bought
that new wood stove, and..."

10:14.823 --> 10:16.658
BOTH: "We're sweating,
and our hands are all slippery,

10:16.742 --> 10:18.994
"and that's why we can't get
the card house to stay up."

10:19.077 --> 10:21.538
Thank you, Chris, we have liftoff!
(LAUGHS)

10:21.622 --> 10:26.460
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, but none of this
stuff seems to make sense.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.795
I mean, we haven't even
referenced the fact

10:28.879 --> 10:31.215
that they're ducks
or that they're handicapped,

10:31.298 --> 10:33.467
but the show is called
Handi-Quacks.

10:34.760 --> 10:35.928
Uh-huh.

10:36.011 --> 10:37.930
Chris, can I see you
in the kitchen?

10:40.307 --> 10:41.558
PETER: (WHISPERING)
This is not working out.

10:41.642 --> 10:43.644
-Dad, Dad, look, she's trying...
-No, no.

10:43.727 --> 10:45.020
She gets along with everybody.

10:45.103 --> 10:46.480
She does not get along with everybody.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.649
-She's kind of hot.
-She's office hot, all right.

10:48.732 --> 10:50.275
-Yeah, maybe you're right.
-She's the only woman around here.

10:50.359 --> 10:52.069
Yeah, in the real world,
she doesn't hold up.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.654
And in addition to everything else,
she's got BO!

10:53.737 --> 10:54.905
She's got BO.

10:59.618 --> 11:01.411
All right, Lois,
for your first assignment,

11:01.495 --> 11:03.413
we want you to do
an investigative exposé

11:03.497 --> 11:05.457
on one of America's greatest enemies.

11:05.541 --> 11:07.000
Oh, that sounds important.

11:07.084 --> 11:08.085
Who is it?

11:08.168 --> 11:09.169
Michael Moore.

11:09.253 --> 11:10.754
Oh, here we go.
This is exactly

11:10.838 --> 11:12.005
what I was talking about, Lois.

11:12.089 --> 11:13.590
Fox News will take down anyone

11:13.674 --> 11:14.675
who doesn't agree with them.

11:14.758 --> 11:15.801
Well, now, wait a minute, Brian.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.219
Give him a chance.

11:17.302 --> 11:18.887
What exactly do you
want me to do?

11:18.971 --> 11:20.305
We have reason
to suspect

11:20.389 --> 11:22.307
that Michael Moore
may be a closet homosexual.

11:22.391 --> 11:23.892
We need you to get the proof.

11:23.976 --> 11:25.269
Well, if you think Michael Moore's

11:25.352 --> 11:27.563
possible homosexuality
is newsworthy,

11:27.646 --> 11:29.940
I'll do my best
to get the story.

11:33.777 --> 11:34.987
All right, I have come up

11:35.070 --> 11:36.947
with a design for
Red Hiney Monkey,

11:37.030 --> 11:38.198
the head of the Handi-Quacks.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.868
I want only positive feedback, please.

11:40.951 --> 11:42.786
Why does he have such a big red bum?

11:42.870 --> 11:44.371
Because it's funny, Meg.

11:44.454 --> 11:45.914
People will tune in to
Handi-Quacks each week

11:45.998 --> 11:47.249
and see that big red bum

11:47.332 --> 11:48.834
and get a big laugh out of it.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.669
Why? Because it's relatable.

11:50.752 --> 11:52.462
They'll see themselves in it.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.464
I think the design is great, Dad.

11:54.548 --> 11:55.632
Good note, good note.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.176
Okay, now, I also had a thought

11:57.259 --> 11:59.052
for a female character
who's always nagging

11:59.136 --> 12:00.721
at Red Hiney Monkey
and telling him

12:00.804 --> 12:03.056
not to leave his beer cans
lying around and whatnot.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.391
And her name is Bitch Duck.

12:04.516 --> 12:05.767
That kind of looks like Mom.

12:05.851 --> 12:06.852
Not finished talking, Meg.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.146
Okay, and this is Poopyface Tomato Nose.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.356
You can see I gave him
a funny little suitcase.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.358
Now, see, the joke is
most people

12:13.442 --> 12:15.611
only carry a suitcase
when they're going on vacation,

12:15.694 --> 12:18.780
but Poopyface Tomato Nose
carries one all the time.

12:18.864 --> 12:21.116
And see, he's got a sleeve
hanging out.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.367
He didn't pack it right.

12:22.451 --> 12:24.286
Oh, well, you know
what could be funny?

12:24.369 --> 12:26.246
Maybe one week,
he actually goes on vacation.

12:27.664 --> 12:30.459
And he's already got the suitcase.

12:30.542 --> 12:33.629
Chris, can I see you in
the kitchen for a sec?

12:33.712 --> 12:35.797
PETER: (WHISPERING)
Your writing partner is out of her mind.

12:35.881 --> 12:37.633
CHRIS: Okay, first of all,
stop calling her my partner.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.009
-She's terrible.
-I know that!

12:39.092 --> 12:40.511
-And you know what, it's not...
-What?

12:40.594 --> 12:42.262
-It's not fair to her.
-Well, that's sort of a...

12:42.346 --> 12:43.722
Having her here is not fair to her.

12:43.805 --> 12:44.890
Well, if you want to fire her,

12:44.973 --> 12:46.266
you go ahead and fire her,

12:46.350 --> 12:48.101
but don't pretend
you're doing it for her benefit.

12:48.185 --> 12:49.561
Don't put that on me.

12:49.645 --> 12:50.854
-She's firing herself.
-She can't fire herself.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.231
Yeah, she's firing herself

12:52.314 --> 12:54.566
with her lack of talent
and her lack of funniness.

12:54.650 --> 12:56.735
I just... you know,
I just feel like you and I

12:56.818 --> 12:58.237
have captured lightning in a bottle

12:58.320 --> 12:59.988
with Handi-Quacks,
and she's just coming in,

13:00.072 --> 13:02.908
unscrewing the top
and letting it all out.

13:02.991 --> 13:05.744
Meg, your services will
no longer be needed.

13:12.668 --> 13:14.419
(SIGHS) Still nothing.

13:14.503 --> 13:16.505
I don't understand.
The lights are on.

13:16.588 --> 13:17.965
Somebody must be home.

13:19.007 --> 13:20.300
(GASPS) Get down!

13:22.177 --> 13:23.929
Rush Limbaugh?

13:24.012 --> 13:25.305
What's he doing coming out

13:25.389 --> 13:27.099
of Michael Moore's house
at this hour?

13:27.182 --> 13:28.934
Unless...

13:29.017 --> 13:30.435
Oh, my God.

13:30.519 --> 13:32.563
Oh, my God,
it's true.

13:32.646 --> 13:37.609
Michael Moore is gay
with Rush Limbaugh.

13:37.693 --> 13:39.570
And I just laid in dog poop.

13:39.653 --> 13:40.821
That's not dog poop.

13:40.904 --> 13:42.948
Sorry. We've been out
here a long time.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.371
LOIS: And look, there's Rush Limbaugh

13:49.454 --> 13:50.455
coming out of Michael Moore's house

13:50.539 --> 13:52.124
at 2:00 in the morning.

13:52.207 --> 13:53.959
I wouldn't believe it
if I hadn't seen it myself.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.419
Well, your dog was right, Lois.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.171
Looks like there's no story here.

13:57.254 --> 13:58.630
Michael Moore is clearly not gay.

13:58.714 --> 14:00.299
What... No story?

14:00.382 --> 14:01.925
What are you talking about?

14:02.009 --> 14:04.178
You're the one who sent me
to investigate,

14:04.261 --> 14:06.513
and now I'm showing you proof,
and you're dismissing it?

14:06.597 --> 14:08.515
I don't understand.

14:08.599 --> 14:09.850
Lois, I'll be honest.

14:09.933 --> 14:12.019
Rush Limbaugh is one of us.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.646
We have no wish to smear
a fellow conservative.

14:14.730 --> 14:16.523
That would be as foolish as FDR

14:16.607 --> 14:18.483
hiring that midget press secretary.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.822
The president has just confirmed
a devastating surprise attack

14:23.906 --> 14:25.449
by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.035
Much of our Naval fleet
has been destroyed,

14:28.118 --> 14:30.787
and the death toll is believed
to be in the thousands.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.956
MAN: He's adorable!

14:36.043 --> 14:37.294
Okay, actors,

14:37.377 --> 14:40.005
welcome to the first voice record
for Handi-Quacks.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.382
All right, episode one,
"What the Duck?"

14:42.466 --> 14:43.592
Take one.

14:43.675 --> 14:46.178
Oh, darn it, Poopyface Tomato Nose.

14:46.261 --> 14:48.222
I know,
Red Hiney Monkey.

14:48.305 --> 14:50.098
This card house won't stay up.

14:50.182 --> 14:52.935
Probably because
the wood stove is so warm.

14:53.018 --> 14:55.604
It's making our hands
sweaty and slippery.

14:55.687 --> 14:56.730
It's all coming together.

14:56.813 --> 14:57.898
It's all coming together.

14:57.981 --> 14:59.566
This is it. Our vision come to life.

14:59.650 --> 15:00.651
I know.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.069
Just listen to that voice,

15:02.152 --> 15:04.488
and then picture him holding that suitcase
with the sleeve sticking out.

15:04.571 --> 15:05.781
(LAUGHING)

15:05.864 --> 15:07.032
(AUSTRALIAN ACCENT)
Hi, everybody.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.034
Hello, Colonel Tushfinger.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.036
I just built a spaceship.

15:11.119 --> 15:13.247
Want to come up
in space with me in it?

15:13.330 --> 15:15.332
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, cut, cut, cut.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.875
Cleveland, what are you doing?

15:16.959 --> 15:19.086
I just figured I'd give Colonel Tushfinger

15:19.169 --> 15:21.255
an Australian thing.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.841
Colonel Tushfinger lives on the moon,
you idiot.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.884
He talks with a moon accent,
you know?

15:25.968 --> 15:27.719
(STRANGE ACCENT)
He talks like this with a moon accent.

15:27.803 --> 15:29.137
You understand?

15:29.221 --> 15:30.973
I am Colonel Tushfinger,
and I live on the moon,

15:31.056 --> 15:33.684
so I talk like this with a moon accent.
Do that.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.561
You know, Bonnie also acts.

15:35.644 --> 15:36.895
Oh, here we go.

15:40.274 --> 15:42.484
So, they want me to drop
the story completely

15:42.568 --> 15:44.945
because they don't want
to embarrass Rush Limbaugh.

15:45.028 --> 15:47.114
Now do you see what I was
saying about Fox News?

15:47.197 --> 15:48.866
They have an incredibly
biased agenda.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.368
-You should do the story anyway.
-You think so?

15:51.451 --> 15:52.744
Absolutely. They're hypocrites.

15:52.828 --> 15:54.830
They wanted you to do
the story when they thought

15:54.913 --> 15:55.956
it would embarrass Michael Moore,

15:56.039 --> 15:57.499
but they don't want you to do it

15:57.583 --> 15:59.042
if it's going to
embarrass Rush Limbaugh.

15:59.126 --> 16:00.961
But you didn't want me
to do the story

16:01.044 --> 16:02.379
when it was gonna
embarrass Michael Moore,

16:02.462 --> 16:03.964
but you want me
to do the story

16:04.047 --> 16:06.049
if it's gonna embarrass
Rush Limbaugh?

16:06.133 --> 16:07.926
Can you picture
the two of those guys

16:08.010 --> 16:09.219
poking each other in the chops?

16:09.303 --> 16:10.512
(GROANING)

16:10.596 --> 16:12.681
Be like sticking your arm
in a backed-up sink.

16:12.764 --> 16:13.765
Okay, you're right, I'm...

16:13.849 --> 16:14.892
I'm a little biased myself,

16:14.975 --> 16:16.393
but at least I'm willing to admit it.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.395
Imagine that,
the two of them going at it.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.022
An oversized Armani suit

16:20.105 --> 16:21.648
and an oversized cheap windbreaker

16:21.732 --> 16:23.692
tossed casually on the floor?

16:23.775 --> 16:24.818
Look, they started this, Lois,

16:24.902 --> 16:26.737
but it's up to you to finish it.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.071
I guess you're right, Brian.

16:28.155 --> 16:29.448
Next day at work,

16:29.531 --> 16:31.408
Limbaugh finds a Detroit Tigers
ball cap up in there?

16:31.491 --> 16:32.534
Stewie, shut up!

16:32.618 --> 16:34.119
What? It's just a weird image,

16:34.203 --> 16:35.996
like the way
Commissioner Gordon tells Batman

16:36.079 --> 16:37.789
that he just took a poop.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.084
Ugh! I don't need
to know about that.

16:46.715 --> 16:48.800
Thanks for hearing our pitch, Mr. Chernin.

16:48.884 --> 16:50.260
You realize the only reason

16:50.344 --> 16:51.553
I'm taking this meeting is

16:51.637 --> 16:53.722
that your wife is a reporter
for our news division.

16:53.805 --> 16:55.599
You have absolutely no prior credits.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.142
Sir, I promise you won't regret it.

16:57.226 --> 16:59.228
Handi-Quacks is gonna
be the next Simpsons.

16:59.311 --> 17:00.854
We fire the jokes at ya

17:00.938 --> 17:02.147
like an automatic weapon of comedy.

17:02.231 --> 17:03.690
We throw a curveball joke at you,

17:03.774 --> 17:05.234
hits you right in the head, you go,

17:05.317 --> 17:06.443
-"Wow! What happened?"
-Hmm.

17:06.527 --> 17:08.278
We take you on a little
trolley ride down

17:08.362 --> 17:10.656
Story Lane, you're having a good time
enjoying our little tale,

17:10.739 --> 17:12.533
think you know what's coming--
Boom! Left turn!

17:12.616 --> 17:13.825
You don't know how it happened,

17:13.909 --> 17:15.702
you don't know where you are,
but you like it!

17:15.786 --> 17:17.496
-Uh-huh.
-You're watchin' the show,

17:17.579 --> 17:19.081
the ducks're sayin' stuff,
you're yukkin' it up,

17:19.164 --> 17:20.541
you're laughing,
your sides are hurting,

17:20.624 --> 17:22.751
and all of a sudden you realize
you're feelin' something, too.

17:22.835 --> 17:24.253
When did that happen?

17:24.336 --> 17:27.089
When did the Handi-Quacks
become people I care about?

17:27.172 --> 17:29.424
When did they become like welcome guests
in your home

17:29.508 --> 17:32.845
whose weekly visits
the whole family eagerly awaits?

17:32.928 --> 17:35.013
Take a look at what we got, Peter.

17:35.097 --> 17:37.349
(LIVELY PIANO TUNE PLAYS)

17:37.432 --> 17:39.601
PETER: (SINGING) One day three ducks
were crossing the road

17:39.685 --> 17:41.728
Going to get some soda

17:41.812 --> 17:44.147
But they weren't looking
where they were going

17:44.231 --> 17:46.149
And a bus came along
and hit them all

17:46.233 --> 17:48.819
Now they're
handicapped and...

17:48.902 --> 17:49.987
Eh... eh...

17:50.070 --> 17:52.781
No, that's pretty much it

17:52.865 --> 17:54.491
Handi-Quacks

17:54.783 --> 17:58.245
And they never got their soda.

18:02.082 --> 18:04.251
JOE: Why won't
this card house stay up?

18:04.334 --> 18:06.670
GLENN: Our palms
are slippery and sweaty

18:06.753 --> 18:09.923
because of the heat from that
new wood stove we just bought.

18:10.007 --> 18:12.259
(SNICKERS)
That's gonna be his catchphrase.

18:12.342 --> 18:14.803
CLEVELAND: How did you
afford that wood stove?

18:14.887 --> 18:17.598
Easy. I just walked
into the wood stove store

18:17.681 --> 18:19.308
and said,
"Put it on my bill."

18:19.391 --> 18:20.601
(LAUGHING)

18:20.684 --> 18:22.311
(LAUGHS)
Huh? You with me?

18:22.394 --> 18:23.729
I sure am.

18:23.812 --> 18:25.105
-You're with me now?
-I love it.

18:25.189 --> 18:26.356
You know you love it.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.066
I just have one small change.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.693
Oh?

18:29.776 --> 18:32.946
Could Poopyface Tomato Nose's nose
be a plum?

18:33.030 --> 18:35.657
How dare you!

18:35.741 --> 18:37.284
It's a small change.

18:37.367 --> 18:39.620
And if you do it,
we'll really get behind this show.

18:39.703 --> 18:41.997
A plum?
What is this, 1986?

18:42.080 --> 18:43.874
Well, if you're gonna
be a TV producer,

18:43.957 --> 18:46.168
you've gotta be open
to collaboration.

18:46.251 --> 18:48.962
So everybody just gets
to stick their big chef's spoon

18:49.046 --> 18:51.882
into my comedy gumbo, eh?
Well, no deal!

18:51.965 --> 18:54.134
You know something?
I like your passion.

18:54.218 --> 18:58.096
Okay. We'll do the show,
and we'll do it your way.

18:58.180 --> 19:00.182
No.

19:00.474 --> 19:02.226
Well, that was a miscalculation.

19:04.186 --> 19:07.189
All right, there it is.
Stay close to me.

19:19.368 --> 19:21.537
(GASPS) This is it. Let's go.

19:21.620 --> 19:23.664
Mr. Moore! Mr. Limbaugh!

19:23.747 --> 19:26.333
Do you have anything to say
to Fox News about this...

19:26.416 --> 19:27.793
What the hell?

19:27.876 --> 19:29.127
Who are you?

19:29.211 --> 19:30.879
What's that suit on the bed?

19:30.963 --> 19:33.423
And what have you done with your
gay lover, Rush Limbaugh?

19:33.507 --> 19:35.551
(SIGHS) I am Rush Limbaugh.

19:35.634 --> 19:37.010
That's a costume.

19:37.094 --> 19:38.846
Wait a minute.
You mean, all these years,

19:38.929 --> 19:41.640
Rush Limbaugh has just been
Michael Moore in disguise?

19:41.723 --> 19:44.142
Well, it's a little more
complex than that.

19:44.226 --> 19:46.061
What are you talking about?

19:47.437 --> 19:48.438
Fred Savage?

19:48.522 --> 19:49.815
Wait a minute.

19:49.898 --> 19:52.025
You're Rush Limbaugh
and Michael Moore?

19:52.150 --> 19:54.611
Yes, I am.
They're both characters I created.

19:54.695 --> 19:56.780
But why?

19:56.864 --> 19:58.282
Well, after The Wonder Years,

19:58.365 --> 20:00.576
I was hungry to do more acting,
but the pickings were slim.

20:00.659 --> 20:03.203
So I came up with this scheme
to satisfy my need to perform,

20:03.287 --> 20:05.330
and I guess it got
a little out of hand.

20:05.414 --> 20:07.916
-This is unbelievable.
-Well, that's not the end of it.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.419
I'm also Tony Danza, Camryn Manheim,

20:10.502 --> 20:12.087
Malcolm-Jamal Warner,
Kevin Nealon,

20:12.171 --> 20:14.965
John Forsythe
and Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich.

20:15.048 --> 20:18.135
Wow. Fred Savage is
the greatest actor

20:18.218 --> 20:20.012
in the history of the world.

20:20.095 --> 20:22.014
That's all I ever wanted
people to know.

20:22.097 --> 20:23.599
Well, if you let us run this story,

20:23.682 --> 20:24.975
I promise you they will.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.643
You got a deal.

20:26.727 --> 20:28.312
DANIEL STERN:
Well, it finally happened.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.772
I had finally gotten the
recognition I deserved.

20:30.856 --> 20:32.900
I don't need you anymore!

20:37.362 --> 20:39.698
ANNOUNCER: This Sunday on Fox,
it's the new hit comedy

20:39.781 --> 20:43.285
starring America's greatest actor,
Fred Savage!

20:43.368 --> 20:45.662
Well, Lois, you did
a good thing for a talented guy.

20:45.746 --> 20:47.706
Yeah, but that should have been
our time slot.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.791
I'm just glad everything's
back to normal.

20:49.875 --> 20:52.211
I don't think I was cut out
to be a TV reporter.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.379
Yeah, how did you lose
your job there, anyway?

20:54.463 --> 20:56.507
Oh, I don't know.
Do you really care, Peter?

20:56.590 --> 20:58.091
I mean, does anyone really care?

20:58.175 --> 21:00.302
Yeah, you're right.
The story's over.

21:00.385 --> 21:02.095
Everything'll be back
to normal next week,

21:02.179 --> 21:03.555
so, yeah, who gives a damn?

21:03.639 --> 21:06.016
Anybody got
any more jokes? Stewie?

21:06.099 --> 21:07.518
Anything funny?
No? Brian?

21:07.601 --> 21:09.895
Meg? Chris? No?

21:09.978 --> 21:12.147
All right. See ya, folks.

21:12.523 --> 21:14.525
