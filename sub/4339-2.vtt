00:00.768 --> 00:04.403
-<i> Previously on</i> The Strain.

00:06.607 --> 00:09.508
- (man): Welcome, children.
- Is this the new school?

00:09.510 --> 00:12.878
- Your journey has indeed
come to an end,

00:12.880 --> 00:15.514
but your adventure is just
beginning.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.116
Rejoice, Kelly.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.318
<i> The Master's bestowed upon you</i>

00:19.320 --> 00:23.022
<i> the blessing of a new family.</i>
<i> They have unique abilities -</i>

00:23.024 --> 00:26.358
<i> sight and perception</i>
<i> beyond the physical spectrum.</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:29.962
(clicking)
<i> Behold the Feelers.</i>

00:29.964 --> 00:34.066
- Finding a cure or making
a vaccine is nearly impossible,

00:34.068 --> 00:37.336
but what we can do
is take everything we know

00:37.338 --> 00:39.505
about how to stop an epidemic
and use that knowledge

00:39.507 --> 00:41.907
to start one.
- Infect the infected.

00:41.909 --> 00:44.910
- Break the chain.

00:44.912 --> 00:47.046
- Don't shoot!

00:51.685 --> 00:54.887
- No, wait, wait! We need them.

01:00.327 --> 01:03.162
- Beautiful, is it not?

01:03.164 --> 01:07.232
Each figure has
a meaning of its own.

01:07.234 --> 01:10.436
Together they form
a larger meaning...

01:10.438 --> 01:13.238
a glorious prophecy.

01:15.176 --> 01:17.242
No.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.347
- I don't understand.

01:22.349 --> 01:24.283
- Our Master is about to undergo

01:24.285 --> 01:27.786
a wondrous transformation.

01:27.788 --> 01:30.255
Our enemies burned
his flesh,

01:30.257 --> 01:34.760
but soon he will
select another vessel

01:34.762 --> 01:37.262
and rise again.

01:39.867 --> 01:42.201
- Who will he choose?

01:42.203 --> 01:44.336
- That is for him to decide.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.707
And when he does,

01:48.709 --> 01:51.376
all his followers
must embrace his wisdom

01:51.378 --> 01:55.747
and continue
to serve him faithfully.

01:55.749 --> 01:58.650
Are you prepared to do that?

02:00.554 --> 02:03.489
- Of course.
- Good.

02:35.789 --> 02:38.223

¶¶

03:54.835 --> 03:58.737
- How's that?
- That's better.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.506
I still feel kind of hot.
- Yeah. You have a fever.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.709
- What's that for?
- You've been through

04:03.711 --> 04:06.612
quite a shock. This will help.

04:06.614 --> 04:09.514
- When can we go home?

04:09.516 --> 04:11.783
- To your storage shed?
Not anytime soon.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.852
It's crawling with vampires.

04:13.854 --> 04:17.089
- We'll find a safer place
for you when you feel better.

04:30.537 --> 04:33.705
When are we gonna tell 'em?

04:33.707 --> 04:37.409
- In a couple of hours
when they wake up.

04:37.411 --> 04:40.279
- You mean when they're
too sick to put up a fight?

04:46.387 --> 04:48.920
- They're infected...

04:48.922 --> 04:51.323
does it matter?

04:54.061 --> 04:56.328
- (man on radio):<i> ...scene</i>
<i> of another bizarre murder</i>

04:56.330 --> 05:00.065
<i> that claimed the lives of</i>
<i> a young couple in Brooklyn who</i>

05:00.067 --> 05:01.667
<i>were found in their basement...</i>
(clanking)

05:01.669 --> 05:04.870
- Morning, sunshine!
- Come in.

05:08.309 --> 05:10.676
- Just checking in, you know.

05:10.678 --> 05:14.746
It's almost noon and
you hadn't come out and, uh...

05:14.748 --> 05:16.748
- You thought I dropped dead.

05:16.750 --> 05:20.452
- I figured
there was a 20% chance.

05:20.454 --> 05:24.122
Now look, Dutch and I, we're...

05:24.124 --> 05:26.925
we're gonna go clear out
some local munchers.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.094
I just wanted to check in

05:29.096 --> 05:31.630
and see if you need
anything before I go.

05:31.632 --> 05:35.033
- No, nothing.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.968
- All right.

05:36.970 --> 05:40.505
Well, don't forget
to eat something, all right?

05:40.507 --> 05:43.742
- You want to remind me
to go to the toilet, too?

05:45.946 --> 05:49.548
- Professor, I was...

05:49.550 --> 05:51.516
wondering,

05:51.518 --> 05:53.985
what do you hope to find
in these books?

05:53.987 --> 05:55.654
- Something I overlooked.

05:55.656 --> 05:59.291
Of all the evils a man faces,

05:59.293 --> 06:02.361
growing old is the one
I cannot do anything about.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.565
When I was young,

06:06.567 --> 06:08.567
I could hold
all this in my head,

06:08.569 --> 06:11.737
and now it seems to be

06:11.739 --> 06:14.005
slipping away from me.

06:14.007 --> 06:17.909
Somewhere in here, there,
there, there must be a clue.

06:17.911 --> 06:22.147
- A clue to what?
- An ancient book.

06:22.149 --> 06:25.350
If I can find it...

06:25.352 --> 06:29.054
it may tell me
how to destroy the Master.

06:34.361 --> 06:36.495
- Workers discovered

06:36.497 --> 06:39.498
these bodies while building
a roadway in Gliwice, Poland.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.367
They were buried
almost a thousand years ago.

06:42.369 --> 06:44.770
(clicking)

06:44.772 --> 06:47.105
Notice how their heads
have been severed and placed

06:47.107 --> 06:50.342
beside their feet.
Thus we can see the pagan myth

06:50.344 --> 06:54.613
of vampires persists well
into the Christian era.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.782
- Isn't it possible
that these myths persist

06:56.784 --> 06:58.884
because vampires are real?

06:58.886 --> 07:01.553
(students murmuring)

07:01.555 --> 07:03.955
- Some still believe that.

07:03.957 --> 07:07.459
(bell ringing)

07:07.461 --> 07:10.295
- Here is your homework
assignment for Monday.

07:10.297 --> 07:13.732
Remember, all quotes
must be footnoted.

07:13.734 --> 07:16.468
(students whispering)
- Professor Setrakian?

07:16.470 --> 07:21.006
Eldritch Palmer would like
to speak with you.

07:27.147 --> 07:30.382
- It is an honor to finally
meet you, Professor Setrakian.

07:30.384 --> 07:34.386
Well, I am a great admirer
of yours.

07:34.388 --> 07:37.956
May we speak frankly?
- By all means.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.891
- Well, I understand
your caution.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.060
If you were to publicly
admit the truth,

07:42.062 --> 07:44.262
then you'd lose
your position at the university.

07:44.264 --> 07:47.499
- And what truth is that?
- You believe that vampires

07:47.501 --> 07:49.801
have walked among us
for thousands of years

07:49.803 --> 07:53.004
and are with us still.
- Well, suppose I do?

07:53.006 --> 07:55.907
- Well, I share your conviction,

07:55.909 --> 07:57.776
and I want to help.

07:57.778 --> 08:02.547
Now, I'm willing to put
my resources at your disposal.

08:04.084 --> 08:07.619
- That's a tempting offer,
Mr. Palmer, but my work

08:07.621 --> 08:09.921
is too dangerous, and I can't
afford to be encumbered by--

08:09.923 --> 08:11.656
- An amateur?

08:13.460 --> 08:16.294
I assure you that I am
anything but that.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.597
Have you heard of
a Polish nobleman by the name

08:18.599 --> 08:21.166
of Jusef Sardu?

08:23.770 --> 08:26.271
- According to legend,
he was attacked by a vampire

08:26.273 --> 08:28.273
while on a hunting trip in 1873.

08:28.275 --> 08:31.376
- Correct. And he was said
to have carried a cane.

08:31.378 --> 08:35.514
- With a wolf's-head handle made
of white gold. Silver blade.

08:37.117 --> 08:39.317
- It's been missing for decades,

08:39.319 --> 08:41.319
but my sources tell me
that it may have

08:41.321 --> 08:43.855
recently resurfaced here
in Vienna.

08:43.857 --> 08:47.792
- That is the first
I've heard of this.

08:47.794 --> 08:49.394
Well, is it true?

08:49.396 --> 08:51.863
- That's what I need you
to find out.

08:54.234 --> 08:57.736
- I'll see what I can turn up.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.604
¶¶

09:08.849 --> 09:10.415
(airtight door opening)

09:10.417 --> 09:13.552
- Mr. and Mrs. McGeever,
we need to talk.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.489
- What's happening to us?
- Would you both please

09:17.491 --> 09:21.226
raise up your arms?
(device turned on)

09:23.196 --> 09:25.196
- Oh, Mother of God!

09:25.198 --> 09:27.098
What is that?!

09:27.100 --> 09:28.600
- You've both
contracted the disease

09:28.602 --> 09:30.702
that's broken out in New York.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.671
The worms carry

09:32.673 --> 09:34.673
a very aggressive virus.

09:34.675 --> 09:37.275
There's no cure.

09:37.277 --> 09:41.046
You'll both die
in 15 to 48 hours.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.748
- You knew this the moment
those things wounded us.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.717
- We did,
but you wouldn't believe it

09:45.719 --> 09:48.720
until you saw it for yourself.
- Why did you bring us here?

09:48.722 --> 09:52.724
- Because we need your help.
- For over 200 years,

09:52.726 --> 09:55.360
yellow fever ravaged
American cities, killing

09:55.362 --> 09:59.030
hundreds of thousands of people.
The disease went unchecked,

09:59.032 --> 10:02.801
until a group of US soldiers
volunteered to be test subjects

10:02.803 --> 10:06.204
for Dr. Walter Reed.
They helped find a way

10:06.206 --> 10:09.040
to eradicate that disease.
We'd like you to help us

10:09.042 --> 10:11.209
do the same with this.
- Forget it. Come on.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.411
Let's go.
- That's your choice,

10:13.413 --> 10:15.614
but let me be perfectly clear.

10:15.616 --> 10:20.051
Untreated, you will both die
slowly and painfully.

10:20.053 --> 10:23.154
The virus will
reanimate your corpses.

10:23.156 --> 10:27.626
You will then seek out
and infect anybody you love.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.062
Is that what you want?

10:31.064 --> 10:32.831
- Oh God. Evan!

10:32.833 --> 10:36.768
- We could infect our son?

10:36.770 --> 10:39.070
- Count on it.

10:39.072 --> 10:41.239
- It's true, we can't
save your lives. But we can

10:41.241 --> 10:43.141
make you as comfortable
as possible

10:43.143 --> 10:45.577
during the time you have left.
- And you can strike a blow

10:45.579 --> 10:47.979
against this disease,
help stop it,

10:47.981 --> 10:50.315
for your son.

10:55.322 --> 10:58.423
- We have to do this.

10:58.425 --> 11:01.393
- We don't really
have a choice, do we?

11:12.339 --> 11:15.106
(siren blaring)

11:15.108 --> 11:17.108
- First of all,
let me say mistakes were made.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.210
- No shit.
Thanks for the newsflash.

11:19.212 --> 11:22.514
- Councilwoman Faraldo,
Secretary Barnes here has been

11:22.516 --> 11:24.382
good enough to come up
from Washington--

11:24.384 --> 11:27.185
Good enough? It's his job,
which he has not been doing.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.287
- Have you seen
what's going on out there?!

11:29.289 --> 11:31.156
- You mean, the people shooting
six-foot snakes

11:31.158 --> 11:33.191
out of their mouths
and sucking their neighbors dry?

11:33.193 --> 11:35.527
You had a look, Mayor?
- Of course I have!

11:35.529 --> 11:37.462
I've been on the phone
night and day

11:37.464 --> 11:40.131
with the governor,
with Senator Lang,

11:40.133 --> 11:42.634
with Homeland Security
trying to get us more help,

11:42.636 --> 11:46.137
but everybody's been
too busy pointing fingers

11:46.139 --> 11:48.707
and covering their own asses.

11:48.709 --> 11:51.376
And still, the press blames me.
Here, look at this.

11:51.378 --> 11:54.746
See? Canker sores.
I haven't had these

11:54.748 --> 11:58.016
since law school. My God, what
have I done to deserve this?

11:58.018 --> 11:59.918
- I'll make a list.
- Look,

11:59.920 --> 12:02.721
we're facing the most severe
crisis in this city's history.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.756
My predecessor failed
to understand

12:04.758 --> 12:07.525
the gravity of the situation,
but we have corrected the course

12:07.527 --> 12:11.162
and now have protocols in place
to contain this epidemic.

12:11.164 --> 12:14.265
- What protocols?
- The CDC has established

12:14.267 --> 12:16.267
quarantine stations
in each borough.

12:16.269 --> 12:19.170
Symptomatic individuals have
been placed in isolation units

12:19.172 --> 12:21.005
for a 24-hour incubation period

12:21.007 --> 12:23.508
to confirm they're carriers.
- And if they are?

12:23.510 --> 12:25.510
- We're running down
every person they've come

12:25.512 --> 12:27.378
into contact with,
and placing them in isolation

12:27.380 --> 12:29.114
to determine
if they've also been infected.

12:29.116 --> 12:31.349
- No, I meant the original
people, the ones infected.

12:31.351 --> 12:34.886
What are you doing with them?
- Well, for the moment...

12:34.888 --> 12:36.855
(sighing)

12:36.857 --> 12:38.957
...we're confining them
in secure facilities.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.693
- You're warehousing
these things?!

12:41.695 --> 12:44.963
These are vicious,
evil predators. They need

12:44.965 --> 12:46.865
to be put down.
- Put down?!

12:46.867 --> 12:49.467
The United States government
is not in the business

12:49.469 --> 12:51.870
of euthanizing its citizens,
no matter how sick

12:51.872 --> 12:54.072
they are. I have
over a thousand doctors working

12:54.074 --> 12:56.107
around the clock in labs--
- Meanwhile these things,

12:56.109 --> 12:58.076
they're running wild
in the streets.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.044
Where's the National Guard?

13:00.046 --> 13:02.380
- We have more than
10,000 troops in the city

13:02.382 --> 13:05.049
protecting vital--
- Bullshit!

13:05.051 --> 13:07.585
I have seen a few soldiers
protecting City Hall

13:07.587 --> 13:11.289
and other government offices,
but tell me, where are the rest?

13:11.291 --> 13:13.391
- I don't have the file
in front of me.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.126
- Seriously, where?

13:15.128 --> 13:17.829
- I haven't seen them either.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.597
- Once we get control
of this thing,

13:19.599 --> 13:22.667
more troops will become
available. - Listen to this guy.

13:22.669 --> 13:25.136
There's only one way
to solve this problem.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.405
Screw the government.
We handle it ourselves.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.240
- And how do you propose
we do that?

13:29.242 --> 13:30.942
- Oh, I'm already doing it.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.611
We're gonna take back Staten
Island one block at a time,

13:33.613 --> 13:36.915
flush these things out and
blow their goddamn heads off.

13:36.917 --> 13:40.418
Then, we're gonna secure the
perimeter so no more can get in.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.654
Now if you'll excuse me,
you all can carry on

13:42.656 --> 13:44.589
with your mental jerk-off here.

13:44.591 --> 13:48.426
I've got work to do.
(door opening)

13:48.428 --> 13:50.995
(sirens blaring)

13:57.504 --> 13:59.437
- Ms. Marchand.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.507
- I accept your offer of a job.
- Marvelous!

14:02.509 --> 14:04.609
I read that you studied English

14:04.611 --> 14:07.111
at Boston College
and had several plays

14:07.113 --> 14:09.514
produced. So you're a writer?

14:09.516 --> 14:12.383
- Yeah, I write.
How do you know all that?

14:12.385 --> 14:15.720
- Well, after I impulsively
offered you a job,

14:15.722 --> 14:17.789
I less impulsively ran
a background check on you.

14:17.791 --> 14:21.526
Don't worry,
you passed with flying colors.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.862
(helicopter whirring)

14:25.966 --> 14:28.333
- It sickens me to see
what's happening to this city.

14:28.335 --> 14:31.836
You seem to be the one person
trying to turn things around.

14:31.838 --> 14:36.140
I want to be a part of that.
- And you will, believe me.

14:36.142 --> 14:38.509
- So, where do you want me
to start?

14:38.511 --> 14:41.546
- I'm establishing a dozen
food-distribution centers

14:41.548 --> 14:43.848
across the five boroughs.

14:43.850 --> 14:46.351
My wholesale network
will supply them,

14:46.353 --> 14:49.988
and Stoneheart Security
will protect them.

14:49.990 --> 14:53.224
- Well, it's a wonderful idea.
So many stores have been looted,

14:53.226 --> 14:55.226
people are desperate
for the essentials.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.062
- First one opens tomorrow.
The mayor wants me to say

14:58.064 --> 14:59.931
a few words at the ribbon
cutting. I've jotted down

14:59.933 --> 15:03.434
some notes. Type them up and
add a little sizzle and topspin.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.536
I have to go to a meeting.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.872
- You want me
to write your speech?

15:07.874 --> 15:10.608
- We've already established
you're a writer.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.111
- Yes, but if we could just
go over this

15:13.113 --> 15:15.246
so I can get your input--
- I have complete confidence

15:15.248 --> 15:18.149
in you. Just make me look good.

15:20.921 --> 15:24.188
(people screaming)
(siren blaring)

15:24.190 --> 15:27.892
- (Dutch): Why here?
- Ah... A great journey

15:27.894 --> 15:30.228
starts with a single step.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.196
In this case,

15:32.198 --> 15:34.198
we're gonna start
with our own block.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.167
- Yee-haw!

15:41.207 --> 15:42.941
- Ah.

15:42.943 --> 15:45.243
- Consider trying
the door first?

15:45.245 --> 15:47.412
- But where's the fun in that?

15:47.414 --> 15:49.647
(distant vehicle honking)

15:51.484 --> 15:54.452
(soft ambient music playing)

16:10.003 --> 16:12.704
(soft ambient music playing)

16:25.685 --> 16:28.453
Hey, hey, hey.

16:28.455 --> 16:31.022
Be careful, all right?

16:31.024 --> 16:33.858
- I love it
when you get worried about me.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.034
(growling)

16:48.274 --> 16:51.075
(growling)

16:58.785 --> 17:01.019
(growling)

17:07.494 --> 17:10.228
(growling)

17:14.167 --> 17:16.801
- Grenades.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.303
Munchers all around the clock.

17:19.305 --> 17:21.572
I want you to get back...

17:21.574 --> 17:23.641
and make a racket.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.410
- Why do I always
end up as bait?

17:25.412 --> 17:27.845
- Because you look
so appetizing.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.747
- That's right, I do.

17:29.749 --> 17:32.016
(creatures growling)

17:32.018 --> 17:34.919
(ambient music still playing)

17:49.936 --> 17:51.269
(knocking)

17:51.271 --> 17:53.905
- Creatures of the night,
come and get it!

17:53.907 --> 17:56.274
(creatures growling)
(knocking continuously)

17:58.044 --> 18:00.878
That's it.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.814
Come on.

18:07.954 --> 18:11.255
(knocking)
That's it.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.299
(roaring)

18:22.702 --> 18:26.270
(screaming)

18:40.386 --> 18:42.820
(grunting)

18:46.059 --> 18:47.792
- Aaah!

18:49.996 --> 18:52.964
(man groaning and sighing)

18:55.502 --> 18:58.069
- Love the look, you know.

18:58.071 --> 19:00.171
It's bound to catch on, right?

19:00.173 --> 19:02.306
- Silver's not my color.

19:02.308 --> 19:05.143
- Hm... Let me see.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.814
God, I needed that, huh?

19:09.816 --> 19:13.317
- Nothing like a win to get
the endorphins flowing.

19:16.756 --> 19:19.357
- One small step for man...

19:23.129 --> 19:25.830
You know, if we, uh...

19:25.832 --> 19:28.866
clear out the rest
of the buildings on this block,

19:28.868 --> 19:31.769
um, and then clear out

19:31.771 --> 19:33.771
the buildings on the next block,
then we'll, uh,

19:33.773 --> 19:35.773
you know, we'll extend

19:35.775 --> 19:39.777
our perimeter--
(water splashing)

19:39.779 --> 19:42.113
What are you doing?

19:42.115 --> 19:44.382
- Washing off the silver.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.851
It beats that dribbly old shower
at your place.

19:46.853 --> 19:50.721
- You shouldn't knock
a man's water pressure.

19:50.723 --> 19:53.724
Hits him where it hurts.
- Come on in, Rat Man,

19:53.726 --> 19:56.494
the water's warm.
- No thanks.

19:56.496 --> 19:58.462
- Never thought a guy like you

19:58.464 --> 20:00.398
would be shy
of a little skinny dip.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.466
- It's not that.
It's just, um...

20:02.468 --> 20:03.901
- What?

20:03.903 --> 20:06.604
There's no reason
to be embarrassed.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.575
- I can't swim.

20:10.577 --> 20:13.511
(laughing)

20:13.513 --> 20:17.014
It served no part in
my parents' agenda, all right?

20:17.016 --> 20:20.017
I can talk to you
about neoclassic architecture

20:20.019 --> 20:22.987
all day if you like but--
- Get in the shallow end.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.423
I'll teach you.

20:43.509 --> 20:45.843
Can you blow bubbles?

20:45.845 --> 20:50.181
- Yeah, I think I could do that.
(blowing bubbles)

20:50.183 --> 20:52.116
- That's very good.
- It's good?

20:52.118 --> 20:55.686
(Dutch laughing)
- OK, now.

20:55.688 --> 20:58.189
Lean on me.

20:58.191 --> 20:59.924
(laughing): Relax.
- Yeah.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.360
OK... OK...
- OK?

21:02.362 --> 21:04.362
- All right.
- Now let your feet drift

21:04.364 --> 21:06.230
off the floor.
- Oh! Oh!

21:06.232 --> 21:08.399
- Yeah. Oh! Oh!
- Oh!

21:08.401 --> 21:12.103
(Dutch laughing)
- I'm floating.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.071
- Yeah.
- Well, what if I get water

21:14.073 --> 21:17.875
in my mouth and I can't breathe?
¶¶

21:17.877 --> 21:20.878
- Then I rescue you.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.114
- Yeah?

21:33.092 --> 21:35.326
Yeah?
(Dutch laughing)

21:41.401 --> 21:43.100
- (man on radio):<i> The NYPD is</i>
<i> encouraging displaced persons</i>

21:43.102 --> 21:45.569
<i> to seek out approved...</i>
- How are you doing?

21:45.571 --> 21:48.406
-<i> ...and advise people</i>
<i> to avoid...</i>

21:48.408 --> 21:50.408
- I don't want to interrupt,
but our test subjects

21:50.410 --> 21:52.276
will be turning soon.

21:52.278 --> 21:54.912
Throats restructuring,
ringing in their ears...

21:54.914 --> 21:58.082
-<i> ...this after the apparent</i>
<i> suicides of more than...</i>

21:58.084 --> 22:01.085
- I need some advice.

22:01.087 --> 22:05.589
You said the Master can see
through the eyes of his<i> strigoi.</i>

22:05.591 --> 22:08.359
Will he be able to use them
to identify our location?

22:08.361 --> 22:10.861
- Do they know where they are?

22:10.863 --> 22:13.431
- No. We took them to a lab
in the back of the van

22:13.433 --> 22:15.433
before they turned.
- Well then, you have nothing

22:15.435 --> 22:17.635
to worry about. If they don't
know where they are,

22:17.637 --> 22:20.638
neither will the Master.
- Are you sure?

22:20.640 --> 22:22.540
- You doubt me

22:22.542 --> 22:25.109
because I was wrong
about sunlight destroying him?

22:25.111 --> 22:27.111
After all the things
I've shown you, suddenly

22:27.113 --> 22:29.380
you think me
a doddering old fool?!

22:29.382 --> 22:32.783
- Look, I know
you're dealing with a lot,

22:32.785 --> 22:35.886
but guess what?
So am I! We all are!

22:35.888 --> 22:38.556
-<i> ...for the past two nights,</i>
<i> according to police,</i>

22:38.558 --> 22:42.360
<i> leaving behind possessions</i>
<i> and makeshift tents.</i>

22:42.362 --> 22:44.562
- Dr. Martinez.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.468
What you are doing
to those poor people,

22:50.470 --> 22:53.971
it's distasteful, maybe

22:53.973 --> 22:57.408
even cruel, but you're doing it
for a noble purpose.

22:57.410 --> 22:59.477
A couple of weeks ago,

22:59.479 --> 23:01.312
you wouldn't
have had the strength

23:01.314 --> 23:03.347
to do such a thing.

23:03.349 --> 23:07.051
- Couple of weeks was...

23:07.053 --> 23:09.520
a long time ago.
(siren blaring outside)

23:09.522 --> 23:11.689
-<i> ...the incident</i>
<i> at 85th Street...</i>

23:11.691 --> 23:14.058
- I've seen people do things

23:14.060 --> 23:16.660
for the sheer love of cruelty

23:16.662 --> 23:19.663
but you'll never be
one of those.

23:19.665 --> 23:22.600
Ha.
-<i> In a related report,</i>

23:22.602 --> 23:25.202
<i> the blaze which started</i>

¶¶

23:43.222 --> 23:45.356
(man speaking Austrian)

23:45.358 --> 23:48.125
(door closing)
(tick tock)

23:53.633 --> 23:56.267
(floor creaking)

24:08.147 --> 24:11.215
- (with German accent):
That is Dresden china.

24:11.217 --> 24:15.553
Those pieces survived
the Allied bombing.

24:15.555 --> 24:18.222
They are very rare.

24:18.224 --> 24:21.559
- China is of
no interest to me.

24:21.561 --> 24:24.428
- And what is
of interest to you?

24:24.430 --> 24:26.397
(clocks ringing)
- Artifacts

24:26.399 --> 24:28.232
from the war.

24:28.234 --> 24:31.936
- So...

24:31.938 --> 24:34.472
come with me.

24:37.176 --> 24:39.977
(clanking)

24:41.914 --> 24:44.849
I'm certain you'll find
something of interest

24:44.851 --> 24:47.051
in here.

24:52.758 --> 24:54.592
<i> Mein Kampf.</i>

24:54.594 --> 24:57.528
A first edition,

24:57.530 --> 25:00.498
personally autographed
by Adolf Hitler.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.936
Oh, now that is Mayan.

25:05.938 --> 25:09.273
They believed that the skull
could bring forth

25:09.275 --> 25:11.775
the beast from the abyss.

25:11.777 --> 25:15.179
It is part of the personal
collection of Heinrich Himmler.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.553
- Tell me about that cane.

25:22.555 --> 25:24.855
- Magnificent, isn't it?

25:24.857 --> 25:26.824
19th Century.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.893
- May I have
a closer look at it?

25:28.895 --> 25:31.395
- Of course.

25:31.397 --> 25:34.365
It is my most prized possession.

25:34.367 --> 25:37.167
I didn't want to sell it,
but in times like this,

25:37.169 --> 25:40.170
one does what one must
to survive.

25:40.172 --> 25:42.306
Look, there is a feature

25:42.308 --> 25:44.708
I think you will enjoy.

25:46.412 --> 25:49.813
Forged by Wladyslaw Stankievicz,

25:49.815 --> 25:53.918
the finest swordsmith in Poland.

25:53.920 --> 25:57.688
- For Jusef Sardu.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.690
Someone obviously
shortened it.

25:59.692 --> 26:01.926
Sardu was a giant.

26:01.928 --> 26:04.428
- Yes.

26:04.430 --> 26:06.530
It went through many hands

26:06.532 --> 26:08.966
before I acquired it.

26:12.104 --> 26:15.005
You know your history.

26:15.007 --> 26:17.908
Unfortunately,
it is already spoken for.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.377
- When did this happen?
- Yesterday actually.

26:20.379 --> 26:22.713
The buyer is coming to take
possession this evening.

26:22.715 --> 26:24.515
- Would you consider
a second offer?

26:24.517 --> 26:26.517
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I could not break

26:26.519 --> 26:28.819
my word to a client.
I'm a man of honor.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.423
- You...

26:32.425 --> 26:34.625
are a man of honor,

26:34.627 --> 26:37.695
Dr. Dreverhaven?

26:37.697 --> 26:39.630
- Ha!

26:39.632 --> 26:42.299
"Dreverhaven"?

26:42.301 --> 26:44.635
I think you are confusing me
with someone else.

26:44.637 --> 26:46.804
My name is Rolf Steiner.

26:46.806 --> 26:49.807
- You don't remember me?

26:49.809 --> 26:53.911
A230385.

26:53.913 --> 26:57.247
I used to hose down your
operating room after you were

26:57.249 --> 26:59.249
finished experimenting
on my fellow prisoners.

26:59.251 --> 27:03.387
- I told you:
you are mistaken.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.656
- You don't remember
the operating room, Doctor,

27:05.658 --> 27:08.325
or your patients screaming

27:08.327 --> 27:10.461
as you injected turpentine
into their veins

27:10.463 --> 27:13.397
and clocked their deaths?

27:13.399 --> 27:15.966
- Ugh!
¶¶

27:17.737 --> 27:20.871
(door chime ringing)

27:22.908 --> 27:24.942
(tires screeching)
- Ah!

27:24.944 --> 27:28.679
(car honking)
- Just passing through.

27:32.151 --> 27:34.718
(panting)
(classical piano music playing)

27:36.422 --> 27:39.323
(talking in foreign language)
- (woman): Oh my!

27:39.325 --> 27:41.692
(suspenseful music)

27:41.694 --> 27:44.061
(men shouting)

27:55.274 --> 27:57.841
- Ah!
(woman screaming)

28:05.151 --> 28:08.052
(men exclaiming)

28:13.125 --> 28:16.026
- Ah!

28:19.565 --> 28:21.865
(people speaking
in foreign language)

28:28.974 --> 28:31.075
(woman on the radio
talking indistinctly)

28:31.077 --> 28:34.912
- Funny, we used to give blood
to save lives.

28:34.914 --> 28:37.181
- We're still trying
to save lives.

28:37.183 --> 28:39.817
- Two pints of blood won't
sustain our<i> strigoi</i>

28:39.819 --> 28:42.686
for very long.

28:42.688 --> 28:44.655
- Well, if we find
an effective pathogen,

28:44.657 --> 28:46.590
they won't need
to live very long.

28:46.592 --> 28:50.594
- (boy): Who won't need
to live that long?

28:53.532 --> 28:56.834
- We have volunteer subjects.
They're infected.

28:56.836 --> 28:58.368
- Are you gonna cure 'em?

28:58.370 --> 29:01.605
(Dutch laughing)
(door closing)

29:01.607 --> 29:05.342
- Uh, not exactly.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.845
- Good evening,
Dr. Frankenstein.

29:07.847 --> 29:10.214
How's the...
mad scientist business?

29:10.216 --> 29:13.784
- That old couple turn yet?
- They're turning, fast.

29:13.786 --> 29:17.187
- Poor bastards. You should've
put 'em out of their misery.

29:17.189 --> 29:19.056
- (man on radio):<i> The phone</i>
<i> board is gonna light up.</i>

29:19.058 --> 29:21.925
- What's going on here?
What are you doing?

29:21.927 --> 29:23.894
- We're working
on the disease, Zack.

29:23.896 --> 29:27.464
- You are? How?
What's your plan?

29:27.466 --> 29:29.366
- It's... it's very hard

29:29.368 --> 29:31.535
to explain.

29:31.537 --> 29:34.238
- 'Cause you don't think I can
understand or you just don't

29:34.240 --> 29:36.940
want to tell me?
- Right now? Both!

29:40.646 --> 29:42.412
Let me get a little bit further,

29:42.414 --> 29:43.914
and then I'll walk you
through everything.

29:43.916 --> 29:46.150
I'm just trying
to figure it out myself, okay?

29:51.657 --> 29:53.824
- (Martinez):<i> Anything?</i>
-<i> Nothing yet.</i>

29:53.826 --> 29:57.728
The last batch is still
cooking, but check this.

29:57.730 --> 30:00.731
Pseudomonas -
antibiotic resistant,

30:00.733 --> 30:03.667
nasty stuff
that will infect anything.

30:03.669 --> 30:06.470
One drop of<i> strigoi</i> blood.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.845
- Killed them.
Never seen a die-off like that.

30:14.847 --> 30:17.848
- It's absolutely efficient,

30:17.850 --> 30:21.118
ruthless. This virus
would make a great antibiotic,

30:21.120 --> 30:23.086
if it didn't turn us
into vampires first.

30:23.088 --> 30:25.989
(loud knocking)
- Dr. Goodweather!

30:25.991 --> 30:28.192
(knocking)
(woman moaning)

30:29.762 --> 30:31.895
- Be right in, Mr. McGeever.

30:54.954 --> 30:57.221
(woman moaning and screaming)
- Easy.

30:57.223 --> 30:59.656
- What's the problem?
- Pauline's in pain.

30:59.658 --> 31:01.725
You gotta give her something.
- Mrs. McGeever?

31:01.727 --> 31:04.194
Pauline?
- You've got to give her

31:04.196 --> 31:07.030
something now!
(Pauline moaning and panting)

31:09.969 --> 31:11.635
- Come on, come on, come on!

31:11.637 --> 31:14.504
- This should make you feel
better. - My throat!

31:14.506 --> 31:16.974
I can't breathe.
- Give her more! Give her more!

31:16.976 --> 31:18.976
- If I give her more,
it will kill her.

31:18.978 --> 31:21.712
- Then maybe
it's time for that.

31:21.714 --> 31:23.981
- What?

31:23.983 --> 31:27.150
No. Now you agreed to this.

31:27.152 --> 31:30.520
- I don't care. You said
this thing was gonna kill us?

31:30.522 --> 31:32.756
Well, let's end it now.
Put enough

31:32.758 --> 31:34.758
in my wife to put her down

31:34.760 --> 31:37.060
and then you do me afterwards.

31:37.062 --> 31:39.029
Please, Doctor,

31:39.031 --> 31:42.099
make it stop
or, God help me, I will.

31:42.101 --> 31:44.835
- Please, calm down.

31:44.837 --> 31:47.271
Look.

31:47.273 --> 31:50.240
See? The crisis is over.

31:50.242 --> 31:52.876
She's resting peacefully.

31:52.878 --> 31:55.078
Maybe you should too.

32:01.053 --> 32:04.421
- Ugh!

32:07.359 --> 32:08.625
Ah?

32:08.627 --> 32:12.029
You've... Bastard!

32:12.031 --> 32:14.531
We trusted you!

32:14.533 --> 32:16.533
No! Bastard!

32:16.535 --> 32:18.802
Bastard! Ah!

32:38.958 --> 32:41.358
(siren blaring outside)

32:47.666 --> 32:50.167
(grunting)

32:53.906 --> 32:57.007
Goddamn it!

32:57.009 --> 32:59.343
(grunting)

32:59.345 --> 33:02.446
It's all lies!
(grunting)

33:02.448 --> 33:04.281
Fairy tales! Stories!

33:04.283 --> 33:06.450
I'm wasting my time here!
- Hey! Hey, hey,

33:06.452 --> 33:08.986
calm down! Hey!
Hey? Calm down.

33:08.988 --> 33:11.788
(Setrakian panting)
Take a breath now. Hey?

33:11.790 --> 33:13.757
Just a wild guess, but...

33:13.759 --> 33:16.193
So you couldn't find anything
about that lost book,

33:16.195 --> 33:18.562
huh?

33:20.099 --> 33:22.532
(siren blaring outside)

33:24.169 --> 33:26.003
What?

33:42.654 --> 33:44.855
-<i> Well, you've done it.</i>

33:46.325 --> 33:49.092
Now we need to discuss
our next project.

33:50.462 --> 33:52.362
Now, this is reputed
to be an image

33:52.364 --> 33:54.831
from the<i> Occido Lumen.</i>
Have you

33:54.833 --> 33:57.467
heard of it?
It's an ancient book

33:57.469 --> 33:59.903
said to offer
an account of the exact

33:59.905 --> 34:02.305
nature and origin
of the<i> strigoi,</i>

34:02.307 --> 34:04.341
and perhaps even the key to

34:04.343 --> 34:07.544
their destruction.
- If it exists.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.679
- There's documentation
of the<i> Lumen</i> passing through

34:09.681 --> 34:13.083
many hands before it went
missing more than a century ago.

34:13.085 --> 34:15.419
I believe that it is
still out there.

34:15.421 --> 34:18.255
I will pay you
a generous stipend

34:18.257 --> 34:21.925
plus all your expenses, so
that you can focus exclusively

34:21.927 --> 34:23.994
on finding it.

34:23.996 --> 34:26.663
- I'll need all the information
you have on it.

34:26.665 --> 34:28.598
- Abraham, what about
our classes?

34:28.600 --> 34:32.569
The university?
You'll lose your position.

34:32.571 --> 34:36.006
- If you find it for me,
I'll endow a chair for you here

34:36.008 --> 34:39.109
as full professor.

34:39.111 --> 34:42.112
Now, I have a flight to catch.

34:42.114 --> 34:44.681
Think it over.
I'll be in touch

34:44.683 --> 34:46.917
in a few days.

34:51.890 --> 34:53.857
- Can you imagine
what an incredible find

34:53.859 --> 34:57.961
that book would be? And to be
secure as a full professor?

34:57.963 --> 35:00.530
- I don't like it.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.699
He's using you.
- And I'm using him.

35:02.701 --> 35:07.170
He wants to fund our work.
- Abraham, please reconsider.

35:15.814 --> 35:18.281
(low growling)

35:22.387 --> 35:25.989
- The tongue has begun
to bifurcate.

35:25.991 --> 35:28.625
Vestibular enlargement
is palpable,

35:28.627 --> 35:31.261
but, as yet,
no stinger has developed.

35:31.263 --> 35:33.396
Still, we will soon have
to implement

35:33.398 --> 35:36.600
precautions against it.
(machine beeping)

35:36.602 --> 35:39.169
¶¶

35:39.171 --> 35:42.005
Mrs. McGeever,

35:42.007 --> 35:44.174
can you hear me?

35:56.922 --> 35:59.156
- How is she?

36:01.760 --> 36:04.027
- She won't be with us
much longer.

36:04.029 --> 36:07.664
- Can I see her?

36:22.781 --> 36:24.681
Thank you.

36:26.185 --> 36:28.585
(Pauline growling softly)

36:35.127 --> 36:37.727
¶¶
(panting)

36:44.970 --> 36:48.071
(glass breaking)

36:48.073 --> 36:50.207
(glass breaking)
(sigh)

36:53.579 --> 36:56.546
(glass breaking)

37:00.185 --> 37:02.586
- What the hell
are you doing?

37:02.588 --> 37:05.822
- Oh, I love the sound
of breaking glass.

37:05.824 --> 37:07.824
(glass breaking)
- Nothing grew?

37:07.826 --> 37:09.826
- Not a damn thing.

37:09.828 --> 37:13.163
<i> Strigoi</i> appear to be
biologically bulletproof.

37:13.165 --> 37:15.498
- That can't be. Maybe some

37:15.500 --> 37:17.400
strains won't grow,

37:17.402 --> 37:19.669
but S. cerevisiae should grow
on just about anything.

37:19.671 --> 37:22.072
- Oh, great. Maybe we can give
the vampires trench mouth.

37:22.074 --> 37:26.576
Or, uh, maybe a nasty case
of thrush. Watch out.

37:28.080 --> 37:31.715
Ha! You see that?
I made it in.

37:31.717 --> 37:34.050
Well, we should
have looked at more...

37:34.052 --> 37:36.753
pathogenic organisms.

37:36.755 --> 37:41.358
Anthrax, tularemia,

37:41.360 --> 37:44.394
plague.
- Our objective is to find

37:44.396 --> 37:47.631
a pathogen that won't kill
people along with the<i> strigoi.</i>

37:47.633 --> 37:50.400
- Oh, yeah, that's...
that's pretty important.

37:50.402 --> 37:52.802
(man sighing)

37:54.406 --> 37:57.274
- These are all
pure research strains.

37:57.276 --> 37:59.709
- Ah... Elliot had
nothing but the best.

37:59.711 --> 38:01.911
- "GPY 1100,"

38:01.913 --> 38:03.947
auxotrophic for leucine.

38:03.949 --> 38:06.716
This strain absorbs
that amino acid

38:06.718 --> 38:10.253
from the culture medium.

38:10.255 --> 38:13.156
- And vampire media

38:13.158 --> 38:15.925
are deficient
in branched-chain amino acids.

38:15.927 --> 38:17.594
- These lab strains
cannot synthesize

38:17.596 --> 38:21.398
one amino acid or another.
Our bugs starved.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.767
Eph, go check if
there's any complex media left.

38:23.769 --> 38:26.503
I'm gonna mate two
of these haploid auxotrophs.

38:26.505 --> 38:29.439
- The next generation will be
able to synthesize everything.

38:29.441 --> 38:32.342
- Then we'll try it
on our vampire media.

38:39.985 --> 38:43.820
I think we have a winner.
It's multiplying,

38:43.822 --> 38:46.122
taking them on
in cerebrospinal fluid.

38:46.124 --> 38:49.592
- It's munching
on vampire brain juice.

38:49.594 --> 38:51.695
- I can see
some justice in that.

38:51.697 --> 38:54.964
(both chuckling)

38:54.966 --> 38:57.267
- If we can get this
to happen in the wild,

38:57.269 --> 38:59.436
then this bug can obliterate
the vampires' central

38:59.438 --> 39:03.506
nervous system. Let's grow up
a batch and give it a try.

39:08.714 --> 39:11.781
- Showtime.
May I have the speech?

39:11.783 --> 39:13.883
- You should read it first.
We should go over

39:13.885 --> 39:15.885
a few things in it before--
- I'm sure I'll love it.

39:15.887 --> 39:19.556
(applause)
(indistinct talking)

39:26.198 --> 39:28.131
Thank you, Mr. Mayor,

39:28.133 --> 39:30.800
esteemed council members. It's

39:30.802 --> 39:33.036
a pleasure to be here with you
today for the opening

39:33.038 --> 39:37.807
of our first Freedom Center.
(audience cheering)

39:37.809 --> 39:40.810
"I know that most of you
didn't come here

39:40.812 --> 39:42.846
"to listen to some blowhard

39:42.848 --> 39:44.748
"congratulate himself
on what he's done

39:44.750 --> 39:46.683
"for his city.

39:46.685 --> 39:50.987
(audience laughing)

39:50.989 --> 39:54.491
"You came here to get food and
necessities for your families -

39:54.493 --> 39:57.026
"and we're going to let you
do that in a moment -

39:57.028 --> 40:00.764
"but I think it's worth
reflecting on the quality

40:00.766 --> 40:03.666
"you all have in common.

40:03.668 --> 40:05.435
"You are the survivors.

40:05.437 --> 40:07.504
"You're the ones who didn't run,

40:07.506 --> 40:10.240
"who hung on.

40:10.242 --> 40:11.674
"Why?

40:11.676 --> 40:15.712
"Because as much
as we all love to bitch

40:15.714 --> 40:18.415
"about our city,
we're not about to let anyone

40:18.417 --> 40:21.351
"or anything take it from us.

40:21.353 --> 40:23.853
(applause and cheering)

40:23.855 --> 40:27.457
"Now... When the Twin Towers
were built,

40:27.459 --> 40:30.860
"there were very mixed feelings
about how they looked,

40:30.862 --> 40:34.864
"but when terrorists
brought them down,

40:34.866 --> 40:38.568
"they became
a symbol for our city.

40:38.570 --> 40:40.870
"We all banded together,

40:40.872 --> 40:43.206
and we rebuilt the site.

40:43.208 --> 40:46.409
"Because whether we loved
or hated them,

40:46.411 --> 40:49.779
"those towers belonged to us!

40:49.781 --> 40:52.315
(audience cheering)

40:52.317 --> 40:56.753
"Why? Because
we New Yorkers are family,

40:56.755 --> 40:58.822
"and when faced with a threat,

40:58.824 --> 41:00.790
"we will link arms

41:00.792 --> 41:03.493
"and help each other up,
and we will endure!

41:03.495 --> 41:07.230
(applause and cheering)
"Because this is our town!

41:07.232 --> 41:09.332
"We take care of our own!

41:09.334 --> 41:12.302
And that's what
today is all about!"

41:12.304 --> 41:14.771
(applause and cheering)

41:14.773 --> 41:18.341
Thank you.

41:20.011 --> 41:22.512
(indistinct chatter)

41:22.514 --> 41:23.847
Freedom for all.

41:23.849 --> 41:26.249
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

41:26.251 --> 41:28.318
- Here's your Freedom Card,
go on in.

41:28.320 --> 41:31.020
- Why do you need my blood type?
I'm just here to get groceries.

41:31.022 --> 41:32.355
- This will serve as your ID

41:32.357 --> 41:34.090
when we open our
medical clinics.

41:34.092 --> 41:36.526
- Thank you so much
for coming along.

41:36.528 --> 41:38.628
Lovely to see you. Pleasure
we could all make it out

41:38.630 --> 41:41.364
here today.
(indistinct chatting)

41:41.366 --> 41:44.701
Thank you. Goodbye. And...

41:46.671 --> 41:49.606
- You're looking
good, Eldritch.

41:49.608 --> 41:52.342
- Abraham.

41:52.344 --> 41:54.944
- Do you realize
what you've done?

41:54.946 --> 41:58.982
- Oh, yes. Very much so.
It's all right.

41:58.984 --> 42:00.850
- I have you to thank.

42:00.852 --> 42:03.686
Without your efforts,
I never would have met him,

42:03.688 --> 42:07.023
and none of this
would have been possible.

42:08.126 --> 42:10.026
- Don't claim victory just yet.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.061
There's another card
left to play.

42:12.063 --> 42:14.397
- Oh, the<i> Lumen?</i>

42:14.399 --> 42:16.633
Still chasing it
after all these years.

42:16.635 --> 42:19.269
- And soon I will have it.

42:20.906 --> 42:22.472
- Look at you.

42:22.474 --> 42:27.043
Withered by age and failure,
yet your blind optimism

42:27.045 --> 42:29.512
carries you on. Don't tell me

42:29.514 --> 42:32.315
you still cling to your belief
in the Supreme Being?

42:32.317 --> 42:36.019
- You should fear his wrath.
- Your "Being" doesn't exist.

42:36.021 --> 42:38.254
Realized that
when I was 10 years old.

42:38.256 --> 42:41.658
Prayed for him to heal me.
He never answered.

42:41.660 --> 42:44.827
- Yes, he did.
The answer was no.

42:44.829 --> 42:48.765
- Your god also turned down
Miriam's cry for help.

42:48.767 --> 42:52.902
She wasn't worthy either,
I suppose. By the way,

42:52.904 --> 42:55.171
I have her heart.

42:55.173 --> 42:57.206
I keep it on a shelf
over my desk.

42:57.208 --> 42:59.676
I'll place yours beside it

42:59.678 --> 43:02.111
once the Master
has dispatched you.

43:02.113 --> 43:05.181
- He tried. I scalded him
with the sun

43:05.183 --> 43:07.684
and he ran.

43:07.686 --> 43:09.686
Next time, I'll finish him,

43:09.688 --> 43:12.255
and I'll come for you.

43:20.398 --> 43:23.333
- Don't let him
leave the facility.

43:25.904 --> 43:29.072
(Beep! Beep!)
(screams)

43:29.074 --> 43:31.341
- (man): What was that?
- (woman): What's happening?!

43:40.151 --> 43:43.052
- (man): Get him out of here
right now!

43:43.054 --> 43:45.121
- (man): Go! Grab him!

43:45.123 --> 43:48.825
Come on!
(indistinct shouting)

43:48.827 --> 43:51.427
I'm on him! Hey!

43:51.429 --> 43:53.830
Ah! Argh!

43:53.832 --> 43:56.833
- (Fet): Run, run, go!

44:06.745 --> 44:08.244
(siren blaring)

44:08.246 --> 44:10.346
I hope you got
something out of that.

44:10.348 --> 44:12.849
- When I mentioned the<i> Lumen,</i>

44:12.851 --> 44:15.918
Palmer grew anxious.

44:15.920 --> 44:17.820
Means he doesn't have it,

44:17.822 --> 44:20.256
which means we still have
a chance of finding it.

44:20.258 --> 44:23.693
- Not the kind of odds
I'd want to play in Vegas.

44:23.695 --> 44:26.462
- The odds have been against me
from day one

44:26.464 --> 44:30.333
and yet I'm still in the game.

44:34.506 --> 44:37.840
(door chime ringing)
(man outside speaking German)

44:43.148 --> 44:46.949
- You're late.
(Dreverhaven gasps.)

44:46.951 --> 44:49.052
- Herr Standartenflihrer,

44:49.054 --> 44:51.154
I must get away.

44:51.156 --> 44:53.556
I've been identified.
- By who?

44:53.558 --> 44:57.427
- A former inmate.
Do you have the money?

45:01.900 --> 45:05.802
- The cane, where is it?

45:05.804 --> 45:07.904
- I dropped it.

45:07.906 --> 45:11.140
I had no choice.

45:11.142 --> 45:13.843
The Jew was right behind me.
He knew my real name.

45:13.845 --> 45:17.080
He knew everything
about the cane too.

45:18.817 --> 45:21.417
- A230385.

45:21.419 --> 45:23.820
- Please, Herr
Standartenflihrer,

45:23.822 --> 45:26.522
I need the money
to get out of Europe.

45:26.524 --> 45:28.891
The Mossad are here
in Vienna looking

45:28.893 --> 45:33.429
for me. If that Jew
goes to them...

45:37.836 --> 45:40.703
(whimper)

45:40.705 --> 45:42.772
- What's happened to you,
Doctor Dreverhaven?

45:42.774 --> 45:46.576
Once, you were a proud knight
of the German Reich.

45:46.578 --> 45:49.912
- That was a long time ago.

45:49.914 --> 45:53.983
How often I've wished
I could return to those days.

45:55.453 --> 45:58.187
- You can.

45:58.189 --> 46:00.890
A new Fuhrer has emerged.

46:00.892 --> 46:04.293
Wiser and stronger
than the first one.

46:04.295 --> 46:08.064
He needs soldiers like you
to serve as instruments...

46:08.066 --> 46:10.099
for his unshakable will.

46:10.101 --> 46:13.269
Does this interest you?
- God, yes.

46:13.271 --> 46:15.772
I'm tired of running.

46:19.210 --> 46:23.212
- Welcome to the fold, comrade.

46:23.214 --> 46:26.616
- Argh! Ah! Argh!

46:30.555 --> 46:33.356
Argh! Ah! Ah!

46:35.927 --> 46:37.927
(screaming)

46:37.929 --> 46:40.129
(growling)

46:50.842 --> 46:52.708

47:17.602 --> 47:20.002

47:22.841 --> 47:25.007
-<i> Cross your fingers.</i>

47:26.878 --> 47:29.412
Let's hope this works.

48:07.051 --> 48:09.385
(soft growling)

48:11.589 --> 48:14.757
(Feelers clicking)

48:23.334 --> 48:27.536
- Find him. Find my son.
