WEBVTT

00:01.552 --> 00:04.077
- Torvald Utne.
The Olympic shot-putter?

00:04.255 --> 00:06.814
The chairman of the UN
Intelligence Committee.

00:06.991 --> 00:09.755
Do you not even skim
the briefings in your inbox?

00:09.927 --> 00:13.294
- I have an inbox?
- Utne decides which spy agency...

00:13.464 --> 00:16.331
gets the insanely lucrative UN contract.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.832
And as you may or...

00:19.804 --> 00:22.204
- probably don't know,
for six years running...

00:22.373 --> 00:24.841
the contract has gone to ODIN.

00:25.009 --> 00:27.671
Ugh. The Organization
of Douche bags In... In...

00:27.845 --> 00:30.507
- Wait, I had something.
- Douche-baggery notwithstanding...

00:30.681 --> 00:33.343
- Nowheresville.
...their ground floor isn't a laundromat.

00:33.517 --> 00:36.645
- Wash-and-fold, technically.
- ISIS needs that UN contract.

00:36.821 --> 00:40.120
So I am going to woo Mr. Torvald Utne...

00:40.291 --> 00:43.727
- Gross.
...with a dinner party. Tonight.

00:43.894 --> 00:46.590
- And you're uninviting me in advance.
- Normally, yes.

00:46.764 --> 00:49.927
But this party is different.
And very important...

00:50.101 --> 00:52.535
so absolutely nothing can go wrong.

00:52.703 --> 00:55.194
Then we better keep
Dr. Bellows away from Jeannie...

00:55.372 --> 00:56.964
<i>- No, no dates.
- I Dream of Jeannie.</i>

00:57.141 --> 00:59.666
No one is bringing a date,
so don't you bring a date.

00:59.844 --> 01:02.540
I don't wanna get there
and be the only one without a date.

01:02.713 --> 01:06.479
And I don't want another one of your sullen
whores using my medicine cabinet...

01:06.650 --> 01:09.483
like a Pez dispenser.

01:09.653 --> 01:12.349
Peggy, you will probably
kill me for this...

01:12.523 --> 01:15.356
but Senator,
we now have a subway museum...

01:17.394 --> 01:20.522
If... Are you still big into trains?

01:20.698 --> 01:24.259
That wasn't her fault.
Who puts OxyContin in a Xanax bottle?

01:24.435 --> 01:26.960
- People with servants, idiot.
- Lf they steal pills...

01:27.138 --> 01:31.370
how does it help to switch the labels?
- Because they can't read English.

01:31.542 --> 01:35.034
Ha, ha. I'm gonna leave you to think about
that whole line of reasoning...

01:35.212 --> 01:37.339
- You think.
- And what scheme you're hatching...

01:37.515 --> 01:40.382
for this dinner party.
- There's no scheme-hatchery.

01:40.551 --> 01:41.745
<i>Hello?</i>

01:43.854 --> 01:47.585
- Do you mind? It's the caterer.
Right. Okay, sure.

01:47.758 --> 01:49.851
<i>Your instructions are clear?
- Ja. No problem.</i>

01:51.395 --> 01:53.625
Oh, I have other call. Yeah, okay.

01:53.798 --> 01:55.288
<i>- Hello? Oh.
Hello?</i>

01:55.466 --> 01:58.401
<i>- Da, da.
- So your instructions are clear?</i>

01:58.569 --> 02:01.129
<i>- Da.
- Excellent.</i>

02:01.305 --> 02:05.241
<i>- Uta, get dressed, we work tonight.
But Mani, what about The Fantasticks?</i>

02:05.409 --> 02:07.502
<i>Tomorrow, liebchen, I promise, but to...</i>

02:08.913 --> 02:12.110
- You brought this ridiculous thing.
- Is it so ridiculous...

02:12.283 --> 02:17.118
to ready my body for the baby?
- Uta. Please do not start this.

02:17.288 --> 02:19.449
Just ready your body for work, hmm?

02:19.623 --> 02:21.488
Fine. What is the job?

02:21.659 --> 02:25.026
Two jobs. The first,
we make a big phony attempt...

02:25.196 --> 02:29.098
to kill Torvald Utne.
- Okay. And the second?

02:30.134 --> 02:31.761
We kill Torvald Utne.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:03.801 --> 03:05.894
So your instructions are clear?

03:06.070 --> 03:09.801
Drinks and fish balls.
You ring first bell for dinner.

03:09.974 --> 03:14.206
And on second bell,
I come out, all John Wooey...

03:14.378 --> 03:17.006
screaming crazy and shooting blanks.

03:17.181 --> 03:20.742
Then I throw myself in front of Utne,
shielding him with my supple body...

03:20.918 --> 03:23.716
as you're gunned down by ISIS agents.

03:23.888 --> 03:26.220
Who are also shooting blanks.

03:26.757 --> 03:28.452
Mm-hm.
- And loud ones.

03:28.626 --> 03:32.619
Because for Utne to buy it,
everyone must act surprised.

03:32.796 --> 03:35.526
- Oh, I'm sure they will.
- Yeah, me too.

03:35.699 --> 03:38.224
Mani, I have a bad feeling for this.

03:38.402 --> 03:41.132
Why? Only I will have real bullets.

03:41.305 --> 03:43.637
This is taking chocolate from a baby.

03:43.807 --> 03:46.037
Oh, no, we won't give
our baby chocolate.

03:46.210 --> 03:48.804
- Ugh.
- He can have carob.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.846
Thanks for inviting us to your
swanky dinner party, Ms. Archer.

03:52.016 --> 03:54.314
- Yeah, I could get used to this.
- Don't.

03:54.485 --> 03:58.421
You're only here because I may
need you to take one for the team.

03:58.589 --> 04:02.355
- Torvald is an incorrigible poon hound.
Ha, ha.

04:02.526 --> 04:05.518
- Those are enormous in size.
Oh, well...

04:05.696 --> 04:09.928
- Uh, thank you. Kind of.
- May I please cup one in my hand?

04:10.100 --> 04:12.660
- Ooh. See, here's the thing...
- We're actually together.

04:12.836 --> 04:15.031
Cyril, go get some gravlax.

04:15.205 --> 04:17.935
Torvald, feel free to cup
anything in the room.

04:18.108 --> 04:21.168
Uh... Oh, you were
talking about my guns.

04:21.345 --> 04:23.108
Strange that you wear them to a party.

04:23.280 --> 04:26.044
- Normally I wouldn't, but Malory...
- But that's ISIS for you.

04:26.216 --> 04:27.911
Always primed and ready for action.

04:30.187 --> 04:33.122
This is good to know.
- Yeah, how about that?

04:33.290 --> 04:37.454
Which is why you should
consider ISIS for the UN contract.

04:37.628 --> 04:40.688
Our agents are highly-trained
in many disciplines.

04:42.733 --> 04:45.031
- Like Krav Maga, for instance.
- My arm, my arm.

04:45.202 --> 04:46.965
- You're breaking my arm.
- Lana.

04:47.137 --> 04:50.937
- Oh, I'm sorry. Did that hurt?
- Yes, it hurt. What is wrong with you?

04:51.108 --> 04:54.942
Nothing but too much enthusiasm
for the opportunity to serve the UN.

04:55.112 --> 04:57.080
- Oh, and hands like the Truckasaurus.
- Hey.

04:57.247 --> 05:00.978
- Gravlax, anyone?
- No. No gravlax. I need painkillers.

05:01.151 --> 05:03.346
- Cyril, in my medicine cabinet... Wait, no.
- Aah.

05:05.155 --> 05:07.953
I have to get it myself,
just right after I get that.

05:09.526 --> 05:11.494
- Hello.
- You're late.

05:11.662 --> 05:14.290
- What is that smell?
- Gravlax and failure.

05:14.465 --> 05:16.456
I think Lana just broke Torvald's hand.

05:16.633 --> 05:19.727
- Truckasaurus. Ha, ha!
- And we won't win that contract if...

05:19.903 --> 05:22.497
Who on God's green earth dressed you?

05:22.673 --> 05:26.040
Nobody, that's why I'm late.
Woodhouse just disappeared.

05:26.210 --> 05:27.507
Only temporarily, sir.

05:27.678 --> 05:30.909
Why are you here?
- Actually sir, I'm with Carina.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.480
- Who?
- Carina.

05:32.649 --> 05:34.276
- Ugh.
- I changed it again.

05:34.451 --> 05:37.318
I feel that Carina
better captures my sensual womanhood.

05:37.488 --> 05:39.547
Yeah, she so totally does.

05:39.723 --> 05:41.714
- You said no dates.
- I said no such thing.

05:41.892 --> 05:44.793
- Well, your mouth did.
- Well, your mouth better get over there...

05:44.962 --> 05:46.691
and make Torvald happy.
- Um, phrasing?

05:46.864 --> 05:50.425
Regale him with exciting
tales of ISIS exploits.

05:50.601 --> 05:54.162
Take his mind off Lana's huge,
Johnny Benchian fingers.

05:54.338 --> 05:56.863
- Can we get off my fingers?
- Yeah, they are pretty big.

05:57.041 --> 05:59.032
- First time I've heard you complain.
- Hi-ho! Ha, ha.

05:59.209 --> 06:02.042
- Seriously, who wants gravlax?
- Sterling, go. Regale him.

06:02.212 --> 06:04.578
- I think he's already being regaled.
Meatballs!

06:04.748 --> 06:08.275
- Oh, for... Torvald.
- Bet you get that a lot, huh, Torvie?

06:08.452 --> 06:10.579
Swedish meatballs.

06:10.754 --> 06:12.813
Get away from me,
you disgusting woman.

06:12.990 --> 06:15.823
- Wow. So even Pam got a date.
- A man, even.

06:15.993 --> 06:19.121
But suave master-spy,
Sterling Archer, stands alone.

06:19.296 --> 06:20.888
Just like the cheese.

06:21.065 --> 06:24.125
- I have a...
- And a very handsome cheese, at that.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.064
I don't even know
how you got out, Woodhouse.

06:26.236 --> 06:27.897
- Alone.
- And I do have a date.

06:28.072 --> 06:30.632
- You do? Where is she?
- She is parking.

06:30.808 --> 06:32.742
Oh, yeah? What's she driving?
A Snuffleupagus?

06:34.344 --> 06:35.902
Uh, oh, wait. Uh, with all that...

06:36.080 --> 06:38.571
sexy European lingerie modeling...
Mm-hm?

06:38.749 --> 06:42.207
To pay for her European
med school that she's going to...

06:42.386 --> 06:44.650
she probably never had time
to learn to drive.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.983
She sounds fabulous.

06:47.157 --> 06:50.649
- Gravlax?
- Thanks, no. I'm allergic to cat piss.

06:50.828 --> 06:52.227
Go away.

06:52.496 --> 06:55.090
<i>So your instructions are clear?
- Oh.</i>

06:55.265 --> 06:58.928
Why must you micromanage
everything? Yeah, yeah, okay.

07:01.305 --> 07:03.637
You know what second-hand
smoke does to a fetus.

07:03.807 --> 07:06.173
Uta, after we kill Utne...

07:06.343 --> 07:10.177
we need to have
a very long and serious talk.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.577
No. I need a painkiller, not a...

07:12.749 --> 07:15.183
- Torvald.
- What is that? A calcium supplement?

07:15.352 --> 07:18.913
- Trust me, dear, these work wonders.
- Okay.

07:19.089 --> 07:20.522
But what I have seen...

07:20.691 --> 07:24.024
ISIS is a distant
second to ODIN. Very distant.

07:24.194 --> 07:25.855
What about the groundbreaking
work...

07:26.029 --> 07:29.123
Dr. Krieger is doing for ISIS
in our Applied Research Division?

07:29.299 --> 07:31.893
- Yeah, tell him about the sex-robot.
- The what?

07:32.069 --> 07:34.765
- Yes... The what?
- I call him Fister Roboto.

07:34.938 --> 07:37.304
- But it doesn't just fist. Tell him.
- Pam!

07:37.474 --> 07:41.069
He's a fully-integrated
multi-fetish artificial being.

07:41.245 --> 07:45.875
- That is the most disgusting...
- Shut up. Shut, shut. And the best part...

07:46.049 --> 07:50.486
is that he's learning.
- ISIS clearly is not the agency for us.

07:50.654 --> 07:52.815
Rotten gravlax, sex-bots, and, uh...

07:52.990 --> 07:55.424
except for the Negress,
the women are...

07:55.592 --> 07:58.561
Willing to do whatever it takes.

07:58.729 --> 08:01.289
- Still gross.
- And such rudeness.

08:01.465 --> 08:05.162
- Fister Roboto wouldn't take that.
- He's just too damn sensitive.

08:05.335 --> 08:08.634
As also am I. So if you will excuse...

08:08.805 --> 08:13.572
There, there. Let that calcium
citrate seep into your bones.

08:13.744 --> 08:15.439
What about Trinette? She said that?

08:15.612 --> 08:18.604
How about Jade? Oh, no, never mind.

08:18.782 --> 08:22.274
Destiny? No, she's not passable.
With that Adam's apple...

08:22.452 --> 08:24.579
she looks like she swallowed
a Rubik's Cube.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.017
Excuse me, sir.
- L...

08:29.660 --> 08:32.527
- You are looking for a date?
- Are you working?

08:32.696 --> 08:35.187
Mm. You could say that, yes.

08:35.365 --> 08:39.323
Then we need to lock down
your cover story. And, uh...

08:39.503 --> 08:41.801
I need to hit an ATM.

08:44.675 --> 08:46.609
Torvald, please, don't go yet.

08:46.777 --> 08:49.302
- You haven't even tried the fish balls.
- No need.

08:49.479 --> 08:53.210
There is plenty of fishiness going
on at ISIS without your balls.

08:53.383 --> 08:55.044
Maybe I should go say something.

08:55.219 --> 08:58.211
Where's the damn fish balls, already?
I could kill for some food.

08:58.388 --> 09:00.356
- Sure it wouldn't be the first time.
- Lana.

09:00.524 --> 09:03.084
No, I just meant like
she literally killed somebody.

09:03.260 --> 09:05.524
Then ate their corpse.
I saw where you were going.

09:05.696 --> 09:09.496
- You know...
- When I served in the King's African Rifles...

09:09.666 --> 09:13.124
the local Zambezi tribesmen
called human flesh...

09:13.303 --> 09:15.703
"long pig."

09:17.040 --> 09:18.337
Never much cared for it.

09:18.508 --> 09:20.237
Torvald, at least stay for dinner.

09:20.410 --> 09:23.743
- I think you'll be very surprised by...
- I detest surprises.

09:23.914 --> 09:26.815
Which is why the contract
will remain with ODIN.

09:26.984 --> 09:30.147
Mani, do something. Utne is leaving.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.754
Okay, okay, we go ahead of schedule.

09:32.923 --> 09:34.857
Find some Tupperware,
we take food to go.

09:35.025 --> 09:37.084
But you promised me Ruby Foo's.

09:37.261 --> 09:40.753
Yeah, I also promised you a baby.
How's that working out for you?

09:40.931 --> 09:44.526
- Hey, does that cook seem weird?
- Normal-weird or German-weird?

09:44.701 --> 09:46.692
Now, good night, and good...

09:46.870 --> 09:51.068
Evening, you beautiful girl.

09:51.241 --> 09:53.607
- Hello.
- You're not, um, leaving, are you?

09:53.777 --> 09:57.338
No, not if you are staying, Miss?

09:57.514 --> 10:00.074
- Oh, um... Yup.
- Hübsch.

10:00.250 --> 10:02.980
- Elke Hübsch.
- A pleasure, my dear.

10:03.153 --> 10:06.680
- I am Torvald...
- Utne, I know.

10:06.857 --> 10:10.122
- I am a great admirer.
- You know he's not the shot-putter, right?

10:10.294 --> 10:13.092
Of course he is not the shot-putter.

10:13.263 --> 10:15.356
But I am sure he is very strong.

10:15.532 --> 10:18.592
Ha, ha. Unlike these drinks.
Come, my dear...

10:18.769 --> 10:21.363
let us find something potable.

10:21.538 --> 10:25.440
- Whoa. Wait a minute. Hey, Utne. Utne!
- Would you shut up?

10:25.609 --> 10:27.338
We just need to keep Torvald happy...

10:27.511 --> 10:30.878
until dinner.
- And what about my happiness, Mother?

10:31.048 --> 10:33.608
- Well?
- Oh, was that not rhetorical?

10:38.488 --> 10:40.388
The Needle? Why is she here?

10:40.557 --> 10:44.186
Oh, that Russian prick.
He sent two teams again.

10:44.361 --> 10:47.956
And if the Needle kills Utne,
we won't even get our per diem.

10:48.131 --> 10:50.122
But what if you kill them both?

10:50.300 --> 10:52.666
Oh. Yeah, I could do this.

10:52.836 --> 10:54.895
Hey, help.
- Ah! Help with what, sir?

10:55.072 --> 10:58.735
No, I was addressing you as "help."
What's the story on those fish balls?

10:58.909 --> 11:02.072
- Coming right out.
- Hurry it up. All I've had today is, like...

11:02.245 --> 11:04.475
six gummy bears and some Scotch.

11:05.982 --> 11:09.418
- This is why I don't get you nice things.
- Not that. Him. Uta, that was Duchess.

11:09.586 --> 11:13.454
- That was Duchess?
- Yeah, the deadliest agent there is.

11:14.291 --> 11:15.883
Oh, my God.

11:16.059 --> 11:17.754
I can't believe they fell for that.

11:17.928 --> 11:20.362
<i>But if he's on the plan of Frau Archer...</i>

11:20.530 --> 11:24.830
What if her plan is a big fat set-up?
What if they mean to kill us?

11:25.001 --> 11:27.595
- Oh! Mani, the baby.
- Ah.

11:27.771 --> 11:30.604
Okay. So now we go to Plan Manfred.

11:30.774 --> 11:33.800
- And then Ruby Foo's.
- Well, we will see.

11:33.977 --> 11:37.606
Really? A European lingerie model.

11:37.781 --> 11:40.944
Only to pay for European med school.
Ha, ha.

11:41.118 --> 11:44.610
- Like to get a physical from her.
- Or with her. Ha, ha.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.052
- Ow, ow, ow!
- I wonder if Dr. Panty Model knows...

11:47.224 --> 11:49.624
how many pounds it takes
to snap a collarbone?

11:49.793 --> 11:53.559
- She probably uses the metric system.
- Yeah, what do they use? Kilowatts?

11:53.730 --> 11:57.928
- No, in this case it would be pascals.
- Ugh. Hey, Europe, be gayer.

11:58.101 --> 12:00.797
- Lana. Release him.
- As you wish.

12:00.971 --> 12:05.032
- I find your lack of faith disturbing.
- I find your mannish hands disturbing.

12:05.208 --> 12:06.698
I think they're kinda sexy.

12:06.877 --> 12:09.869
- Excuse me?
- They're fingers, Pam, not kielbasas.

12:10.046 --> 12:13.709
But keep them limbered up.
I have a big surprise planned for dinner...

12:13.884 --> 12:16.785
and I need you ready,
locked, and loaded.

12:16.953 --> 12:21.754
Yeah so, do you maybe want to let us in
on your little scheme-hatchery?

12:22.692 --> 12:25.991
- No.
- Oh, if I were 20 years younger.

12:26.163 --> 12:28.461
- I can make you feel like you are.
- Mm.

12:28.632 --> 12:31.533
I would like I think that very much.

12:31.701 --> 12:33.999
- Well then go find an ATM,
- I'm sorry?

12:34.171 --> 12:36.833
Oh, me too. I must leave for a moment.

12:37.774 --> 12:40.106
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, sorry, don't mind me.

12:40.277 --> 12:43.713
- Hey, are you having a good time?
- Oh, I am. Ha, ha.

12:43.880 --> 12:47.748
Good to hear. Please excuse us.
Mm-hm.

12:47.918 --> 12:49.852
Keep her out of the medicine cabinet.

12:50.020 --> 12:52.716
One more dead body in here,
and that bitch Trudy Beekman...

12:52.889 --> 12:55.414
will have me right back
in front of the co-op board.

12:55.592 --> 12:57.856
You don't get along
with your neighbors anywhere.

12:58.028 --> 13:00.861
Who could with a woman who
wallpapered her guest bathroom...

13:01.031 --> 13:02.794
<i>with vintage New Yorker covers?</i>

13:03.467 --> 13:05.526
Yes, Major. I am in position...

13:05.702 --> 13:08.136
and ready to eliminate the target.

13:08.305 --> 13:10.865
<i>Excellent.
ODIN will find it much harder...</i>

13:11.041 --> 13:13.635
<i>... to bribe a dead man
for the UN contract.</i>

13:14.244 --> 13:16.838
And I will find it much more enjoyable...

13:17.013 --> 13:19.038
to work with the woman who runs ISIS.

13:19.216 --> 13:23.550
<i>- What do you mean "with?"
- Against. Obviously. Duh.</i>

13:23.720 --> 13:26.416
<i>Obviously. And so I still think...</i>

13:26.590 --> 13:28.251
you should let me kill everybody here.

13:28.425 --> 13:33.692
<i>Nyet. Under no circumstances
are you to harm the hostess. Who, um...</i>

13:33.864 --> 13:36.958
<i>- Whose name I have no way of knowing.
Hey. What the hell are you doing?</i>

13:37.133 --> 13:40.967
- Uh, Botox.
- Not from the medicine cabinet. No.

13:41.137 --> 13:44.038
Don't use this. She switches
all the labels on her medicine.

13:44.207 --> 13:48.200
- Why?
- I think there's, like, a racial component.

13:48.378 --> 13:50.437
But for all we know, this could be insulin.

13:50.614 --> 13:53.310
- Oh, your mother is a diabetic?
- How should I know?

13:53.483 --> 13:56.008
Why don't you just pour
it on everybody's?

13:56.186 --> 14:00.247
Because our employer was very clear:
We are not to harm the hostess.

14:00.423 --> 14:02.186
But her I want to poison most of all.

14:02.359 --> 14:05.658
- Are you lazy Huns ready, or what?
Oh. Ha, ha. Hello, yep.

14:05.829 --> 14:09.731
- Good. So on the second bell...
- I come out shooting blanks. See?

14:09.900 --> 14:12.266
Uta is just, uh, polishing the gun.

14:12.435 --> 14:16.701
Give me that. Some idiot dropped
a fish ball on my Azerbaijani rug.

14:18.708 --> 14:20.608
- I am that idiot.
- Ach.

14:20.777 --> 14:23.678
Why are you so immature?

14:24.014 --> 14:25.345
I'm 19.

14:25.515 --> 14:27.506
Elke? Is everything all right?

14:27.684 --> 14:29.379
<i>Wunderbar, Tovald.</i>

14:29.553 --> 14:32.147
- How are you?
- I am fantastic, my dear.

14:32.322 --> 14:35.655
Those calcium supplements are amazing.

14:35.825 --> 14:38.123
You're gonna need some calcium,
after I...

14:38.295 --> 14:40.593
do something bad to your bones.

14:40.764 --> 14:42.095
<i>Hello?
- Hello?</i>

14:42.265 --> 14:44.631
<i>- Can you hear me? Come in.
- What? Wait.</i>

14:44.801 --> 14:46.564
<i>- What the hell?
- What is the frequency?</i>

14:46.736 --> 14:49.534
<i>Kenneth?
- Turn off. Turn off. Turn off.</i>

14:49.706 --> 14:52.800
What? I can't hear you, tiny man.

14:52.976 --> 14:57.106
Oh, great. Thanks, Mother,
for replacing the baby aspirin with LSD.

14:57.280 --> 14:58.679
God, that is just...

14:58.848 --> 15:01.009
hmm, classic her.

15:03.019 --> 15:04.611
Places, everyone.

15:04.788 --> 15:06.813
- Is everyone comfy?
Relatively.

15:06.990 --> 15:08.184
Sterling and Lana?

15:08.358 --> 15:09.985
You both have a clear line of...

15:10.160 --> 15:11.787
sight to the kitchen?
- Yes?

15:11.962 --> 15:15.193
- Sure, I think so.
- Well then let's eat. First bell.

15:15.365 --> 15:19.768
- Wow. Forgot how much I hated that.
- Oh, that's right.

15:19.936 --> 15:23.497
I kept it on the nightstand to wake
Nanny whenever Sterling wet the bed.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.971
Ha-ha-ha!
- L... Mother!

15:26.710 --> 15:28.177
Sissy bed-wetter.

15:28.345 --> 15:31.974
- Wait, whose bed?
- It was always "don't ask, don't tell."

15:32.148 --> 15:34.912
Woodhouse. What are you doing?
- Uh, sitting down, sir.

15:35.085 --> 15:37.178
- What, at the table? Like people?
Sterling.

15:37.354 --> 15:39.845
- Sterling.
- What? Look, he thinks he's people.

15:40.023 --> 15:43.117
This Archer is a gigantic douche bag.

15:43.293 --> 15:44.851
Oh, Torvald.

15:45.795 --> 15:48.286
- Who cares about him?
- Oh.

15:48.465 --> 15:50.365
Woodhouse, dear, please have a seat.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.364
- Very kind of you, ma'am.
Shut up.

15:52.535 --> 15:55.265
- Torvald, a toast?
- Sure, go crazy.

15:55.438 --> 15:57.372
- Oh...
Then, um...

15:58.375 --> 16:00.275
- Hooray. Dig in.
Wow.

16:00.443 --> 16:03.606
- And what is this we're eating?
- It smells vaguely poisonous.

16:03.780 --> 16:06.305
It does smell vaguely poisonous.

16:06.483 --> 16:09.646
- Are you sure she has the right plate?
- Pretty sure.

16:09.819 --> 16:12.014
- Oh, Uta.
- What? I am pretty sure.

16:13.523 --> 16:16.515
Don't worry, this is a normal smell.

16:16.693 --> 16:19.719
<i>- This is called Janssons frestelse.
- Frestel?</i>

16:19.896 --> 16:23.957
<i>Yes, frestelse. It means "temptation."</i>

16:24.134 --> 16:27.831
Oh, Torvald. I am very tempted.

16:28.004 --> 16:32.805
Yes, and I am tempted to give
ISIS the UN contract, Malory.

16:32.976 --> 16:35.308
Hmm? I mean, you are?

16:35.478 --> 16:38.845
<i>- Well, it depends on your frestelse.
Mm.</i>

16:39.015 --> 16:40.573
Tell me, my dear, is it tempting?

16:42.485 --> 16:44.419
Elke, what is the matter? Are you...?

16:46.423 --> 16:47.981
Um...
- What?

16:48.158 --> 16:50.422
That's the wrong plate, Uta.

16:50.593 --> 16:51.719
Uta.

16:51.895 --> 16:53.453
That's how you talk.

16:53.630 --> 16:56.030
- Perfidy.
- No, Torvald, there's no perfidy.

16:56.199 --> 16:59.828
- You poison my food over a contract?
- Torvald, I swear I didn't...

17:00.003 --> 17:03.439
When I am finished with ISIS,
you won't be able to get a contract...

17:03.606 --> 17:05.904
for a pre-paid mobile phone.
- No, no!

17:06.076 --> 17:10.012
I will tear you down
brick by perfidious brick.

17:12.882 --> 17:15.214
- It's okay.
- Aah!

17:15.385 --> 17:17.319
It's okay, they're just blanks.

17:17.487 --> 17:19.318
- Oh.
- Well, see, you say that.

17:19.489 --> 17:23.185
- But they were blanks. Weren't they?
- Uh, only if the back of his skull picked...

17:23.358 --> 17:25.724
that exact moment to explode outwards.
- What?

17:25.895 --> 17:26.987
Ugh!
- Oh, my God.

17:27.163 --> 17:29.723
- Damn it. Where are those Germans?
What?

17:30.800 --> 17:32.563
I should not do this in my condition.

17:32.736 --> 17:36.536
What condition? Your only condition
is that you are a stupid crazy girl.

17:36.706 --> 17:40.198
Do not speak to me like a child, Manfred.
I hate when you do that.

17:40.376 --> 17:41.638
<i>I think you like it. Ja.</i>

17:41.811 --> 17:45.542
Because I think you have some serious
and unresolved issues with your father.

17:45.715 --> 17:48.206
Yeah? And maybe that is why I date...

17:48.384 --> 17:50.614
a wrinkled old man like you.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.414
- Wow.
- I didn't mean that.

17:54.591 --> 17:57.355
- No, no, it's okay. I think we both knew it.
- Oh, Mani.

17:57.527 --> 18:00.360
Just strange to hear it out loud.

18:02.499 --> 18:05.764
- Oh, for shit's sake.
- And they didn't do one dish.

18:05.935 --> 18:08.403
- This is funny to you?
- I ate a bunch of that LSD...

18:08.571 --> 18:11.335
you had labeled as baby Aspirin.
- That was baby Aspirin.

18:11.508 --> 18:12.736
- Oh.
Hey, guys?

18:12.909 --> 18:14.171
- Wait, what?
- What, uh?

18:14.344 --> 18:16.869
- What's the plan here?
- I shall fetch a rug.

18:17.046 --> 18:21.005
No you will not. That rug was
a gift from the Azeri Khan himself.

18:22.385 --> 18:25.252
And besides, we're not going far.

18:26.556 --> 18:29.992
Is that hard to do? With those
big old ballpark frankenfingers?

18:30.160 --> 18:32.287
Shut up.

18:32.462 --> 18:34.453
Hurry, the Beekmans
will be back any time.

18:34.631 --> 18:36.098
And nobody touch anything.

18:36.266 --> 18:38.200
God, Cyril, would you go?

18:38.368 --> 18:42.361
- Unh. I should be carrying her.
- Cyril, I paid her, I get to carry her corpse.

18:42.539 --> 18:45.702
See? Just look at this bathroom.
I kinda like it.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.866
Exactly. All right, drop them there...

18:48.044 --> 18:50.569
next to that awful Louis Quinze repro.

18:52.315 --> 18:55.842
Now then. We want this to look
like a classic hooker-murder-suicide...

18:56.019 --> 18:58.487
so, Cyril. Take Sterling's gun...

18:58.655 --> 19:01.123
and pump a round into his prostitute.
Wait, what?

19:01.291 --> 19:04.283
Everyone shoots the chippy.
That way, we're all in it together.

19:04.460 --> 19:07.156
Think of it as a team-building exercise.

19:07.330 --> 19:11.198
ODIN gets to go on Outward Bound.
ODIN can suck it. Now shoot.

19:11.367 --> 19:12.425
Oh, Jesus.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.901
You're next.
Cyril, that was pathetic.

19:16.072 --> 19:19.405
Come on. Everybody shoots.
Hey, I wanna go. Bam!

19:20.143 --> 19:22.611
Now, Sterling, drop your gun
between the bodies, and...

19:22.779 --> 19:26.078
<i>No. Have you never seen CSI?
This is already, like, Clue Town.</i>

19:26.249 --> 19:29.150
Not for long. Dr. Krieger, dear?
What? Oh.

19:29.319 --> 19:32.618
Cyril, call 911 from their phone
and leave it off the hook...

19:32.789 --> 19:35.553
and Sterling.
But this gun, it was a gift.

19:35.725 --> 19:38.353
Oh, please. Nobody gives you gifts.

19:38.528 --> 19:39.961
You don't know.

19:40.129 --> 19:42.996
Whatever you say, dear. Dr. Krieger?

19:45.935 --> 19:48.028
Now, then...
Still didn't get the contract.

19:48.204 --> 19:51.970
Oh, but I will.
And I'll get to see Trudy Beekman...

19:52.141 --> 19:55.474
try to explain this little barbecue
to the co-op board.

19:55.645 --> 19:57.476
That smell takes me back.

19:57.647 --> 20:01.242
- Just like a Zambezi feast.
Yeah, I'm kinda hungry.

20:01.417 --> 20:05.012
- Is that weird?
It would be weirder if you weren't.

20:05.188 --> 20:06.815
Well this torte's a winner, Malory.

20:06.990 --> 20:09.652
<i>- What was the name again?
- Kladdkaka.</i>

20:17.867 --> 20:19.459
Stop it.

20:19.636 --> 20:22.002
I'm sorry. That... That's a funny word.

20:22.171 --> 20:25.971
Oh, I thought we were laughing
at the dead people we set on fire.

20:28.945 --> 20:30.879
Um, sorry.
