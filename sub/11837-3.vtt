WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.636
STRINGER: Previously on
"The Practice"...

00:02.669 --> 00:04.971
Assuming you do hear
God's thoughts,

00:05.005 --> 00:07.207
persuading a jury
of that reality

00:07.240 --> 00:09.142
will be difficult for me.

00:09.175 --> 00:10.376
I had the highest
winning percentage

00:10.410 --> 00:12.913
of any litigator
in my firm.

00:12.946 --> 00:14.380
They had no right
to fire me.

00:14.414 --> 00:16.349
You can't be willing
to take this to trial.

00:16.382 --> 00:17.584
Oh, but we can.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.052
She was terminated
for her disability.

00:19.085 --> 00:20.086
That's against the law.

00:20.120 --> 00:22.656
She will be publicly
revealed as a loon,

00:22.689 --> 00:24.591
which you are, Sheila.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.727
SHORE: Listen, I need to meet
with your doctors tomorrow.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.394
I have no doctors.

00:28.428 --> 00:29.830
You're not being treated
by anybody?

00:29.863 --> 00:30.697
CARLISLE: Why should I be?

00:30.731 --> 00:32.566
Because God speaks to me?

00:32.598 --> 00:35.468
We will need a doctor
to testify

00:35.502 --> 00:37.337
that you have
a mental illness,

00:37.370 --> 00:38.204
because you do.

00:38.238 --> 00:40.073
Please don't abandon me, Alan.

00:40.106 --> 00:41.875
I won't.

00:41.908 --> 00:43.343
Being alone
is not good for me.

00:43.376 --> 00:46.046
Let's not settle.
Nobody's gonna hire you,

00:47.380 --> 00:48.849
except maybe me.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.717
Do you even have the authority
to hire people?

00:50.751 --> 00:52.318
No.

00:52.352 --> 00:53.353
I'll figure it out.

00:54.454 --> 00:56.957
FRUTT: To the world
and to the potential jury pool,

00:56.990 --> 00:58.491
you are the man

00:58.525 --> 01:01.367
who murdered his pregnant wife
and unborn son.

01:01.401 --> 01:02.803
I need you to start
demonstrating

01:02.836 --> 01:04.605
the zeal that comes
with defending

01:04.638 --> 01:06.139
an innocent man.

01:06.172 --> 01:07.874
Daddy!
Hey, baby!

01:07.908 --> 01:10.877
Do you think your mom
killed herself?

01:10.911 --> 01:12.613
I know my dad
didn't kill her.

01:12.646 --> 01:13.947
He loved her,

01:13.980 --> 01:16.750
so I think she must have
committed suicide.

01:16.783 --> 01:17.918
CAMPBELL:
You stated to the police

01:17.951 --> 01:19.385
that you didn't learn
of your wife's affair

01:19.419 --> 01:21.221
until after her death.

01:21.254 --> 01:22.789
And yet the night before,

01:22.823 --> 01:24.390
you were heard screaming,

01:24.424 --> 01:26.392
"Do you love him?"

01:26.426 --> 01:27.928
As I said before,

01:27.961 --> 01:30.163
I don't remember
saying that.

01:30.196 --> 01:32.065
I would like to explore
murder two.

01:32.098 --> 01:33.634
That is a life sentence,
Ellenor.

01:33.667 --> 01:34.935
FRUTT: I don't know
what to tell you.

01:34.968 --> 01:36.069
We are dead.

01:36.102 --> 01:37.303
EMMA: Daddy, let me tell.

01:37.337 --> 01:38.972
BRAD: Emma, please be quiet.

01:39.005 --> 01:41.274
Daddy, you said you--
Emma?

01:41.307 --> 01:43.777
WEST: Did your niece
indicate to you

01:43.810 --> 01:45.646
that she poisoned
your sister?

01:45.679 --> 01:48.515
It appears Mr. Stanfield
did not commit the crime.

01:49.449 --> 01:51.417
WEST: The District Attorney
feels he is duty-bound

01:51.451 --> 01:52.853
to withdraw the complaint.

01:52.886 --> 01:55.288
The charges against
Brad Stanfield

01:55.321 --> 01:56.623
are therefore dismissed.

01:56.657 --> 01:58.124
I killed Molly.

01:58.158 --> 01:59.492
As the case went south,

01:59.526 --> 02:01.034
Emma and I devised
a backup plan.

02:01.067 --> 02:02.869
It involved manipulating you.

02:02.903 --> 02:04.638
Getting you to think
that she did it.

02:04.671 --> 02:07.373
Now we need to help her.

02:07.407 --> 02:08.875
You killed your wife?

02:08.908 --> 02:10.376
Yes,

02:10.410 --> 02:12.145
and I'm not proud
of using my daughter

02:12.178 --> 02:13.514
to secure my freedom.

02:13.547 --> 02:15.749
The mission now
is to fix things

02:15.782 --> 02:16.650
and get her out.

02:16.683 --> 02:18.685
So we all need
to get on board.

02:21.755 --> 02:23.056
There's nothing you can do.

02:23.089 --> 02:24.290
I can't accept that, Eugene.

02:24.324 --> 02:25.358
Well, you have to.

02:25.391 --> 02:27.127
I am sorry, there are--
She's 10 years old.

02:27.160 --> 02:29.029
Listen to me, both of you.

02:29.062 --> 02:30.697
We represent him, not her.

02:30.731 --> 02:31.832
She arguably thought

02:31.865 --> 02:33.567
I was her attorney
when she confessed,

02:33.600 --> 02:35.001
falsely confessed.

02:35.035 --> 02:36.336
YOUNG: Ellenor,
all you can do

02:36.369 --> 02:38.004
is ask the client
to cure his perjury.

02:38.038 --> 02:39.706
If he refuses, he's not--
She works here?

02:39.740 --> 02:42.475
What?

02:42.509 --> 02:44.244
That cuckoo bird.

02:44.277 --> 02:46.312
The woman who talks to God,
she works here?

02:46.346 --> 02:47.748
No, she doesn't work here.

02:47.781 --> 02:49.783
Well, she thinks she does.

02:49.816 --> 02:52.185
She says Alan Shore
hired her.

02:52.218 --> 02:55.488
She's out there
organizing her desk.

02:55.522 --> 02:56.690
Excuse me.

03:06.907 --> 03:08.041
Did you hire her?

03:08.074 --> 03:10.376
I don't have the authority
to hire her, Eugene.

03:10.410 --> 03:12.178
She's here. Look at her.

03:12.212 --> 03:13.714
SHORE: Yes, I said,

03:13.747 --> 03:16.016
"Come practice law with us
on a temporary basis," and--

03:16.049 --> 03:16.950
You're temporary.

03:16.983 --> 03:18.519
And she's totally nuts.

03:18.552 --> 03:20.286
Thank you, Jimmy.

03:20.320 --> 03:21.387
I never figured you
for the type

03:21.421 --> 03:22.355
who liked to weigh in.

03:22.388 --> 03:23.189
What's that
supposed to mean?

03:23.223 --> 03:23.957
Undo this.

03:23.990 --> 03:25.391
He just called me "fat."

03:26.426 --> 03:28.494
First of all,
I would never say that.

03:28.529 --> 03:30.030
Second, you are fat,

03:30.063 --> 03:31.965
and third, you should be--
YOUNG: We are not hiring.

03:31.998 --> 03:33.033
If we were hiring,

03:33.066 --> 03:35.902
we would not be hiring her.

03:35.936 --> 03:37.137
SHORE: Eugene,

03:38.872 --> 03:40.607
I've got to keep this woman
close to me

03:40.641 --> 03:43.710
until I can persuade her
to get back on her medication.

03:43.744 --> 03:44.945
The best means for that

03:44.978 --> 03:46.813
is to employ her.

03:46.847 --> 03:47.814
Trust me,

03:47.848 --> 03:49.516
when she functions
as a lawyer,

03:49.550 --> 03:52.519
her insanity is displaced
by legal acuity.

03:52.553 --> 03:53.520
As I said,

03:53.554 --> 03:55.221
it's only temporary,

03:55.255 --> 03:56.990
and I will watch her.

03:57.023 --> 03:58.525
Please?

04:02.636 --> 04:06.139
(music playing)

04:40.373 --> 04:41.775
WILSON: So she works here?

04:41.808 --> 04:42.843
Temporarily.

04:42.876 --> 04:44.545
She, like Mr. Shore,
will work here

04:44.578 --> 04:45.512
on a trial basis.

04:45.546 --> 04:47.013
She will not draw salary,

04:47.047 --> 04:48.782
and most importantly,

04:48.815 --> 04:51.484
we are not to give
her clients,

04:51.518 --> 04:52.986
ever.

04:53.019 --> 04:54.120
Then why is she here?

04:54.154 --> 04:56.156
I'm sorry,
do paralegals speak

04:56.189 --> 04:57.257
at staff meetings?

04:57.290 --> 04:58.525
That's not
a criticism, Tara,

04:58.559 --> 04:59.860
I'm just trying to get
a sense of policy.

04:59.893 --> 05:02.368
You know what--
Keep it personal, now.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.706
Hello, all.

05:05.739 --> 05:06.873
Sorry I'm late.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.308
Eugene, I was wondering

05:08.341 --> 05:10.143
if we could start
at 9:15.

05:10.176 --> 05:11.978
I have my Feldenkrais
appointments at 8:00,

05:12.012 --> 05:14.515
and they're murder
to reschedule.

05:14.548 --> 05:15.549
Did I miss the breathing?

05:15.582 --> 05:16.983
They don't breathe here,
Sheila.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.719
What?

05:18.752 --> 05:20.320
YOUNG: Ms. Carlisle,
we're running late.

05:20.353 --> 05:23.089
CARLISLE: Every day should begin
with 10 deep breaths.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.891
It oxygenates the brain,

05:24.925 --> 05:26.893
which gives you clarity
and optimism,

05:26.927 --> 05:28.929
which is the greatest
source of energy.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.496
Let's hold hands.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.100
Let's go,

05:35.502 --> 05:37.638
everybody.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.540
Here we go.

05:39.573 --> 05:40.741
Let's suck in life's juice

05:40.774 --> 05:42.709
deep into the diaphragm.

05:42.743 --> 05:43.744
In.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.178
(inhales sharply)

05:45.211 --> 05:46.046
Jamie, let's go.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.948
(exhales sharply)

05:47.981 --> 05:49.049
CARLISLE: In.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.088
Let's go see
Brad Stanfield,

05:55.121 --> 05:55.922
take our best shot.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.591
Yeah, like that'll work.

05:57.624 --> 05:59.225
May I help you?

05:59.259 --> 06:00.534
Yes, I'm Roland Huff,

06:00.567 --> 06:02.736
and I'd like to meet
with an attorney.

06:02.769 --> 06:04.605
Do you have an appointment?
YOUNG: It's temporary, Jimmy.

06:04.638 --> 06:05.639
It doesn't matter.

06:05.672 --> 06:06.940
She's a loon.
ROLAND: No, I'm afraid I don't.

06:06.973 --> 06:09.442
Okay, Roland, if you
wouldn't mind taking a seat.

06:09.475 --> 06:10.611
I'll be with you
in a moment.

06:10.644 --> 06:12.445
Thank you.

06:12.478 --> 06:15.081
You're smart enough to know
whatever your reality is,

06:15.115 --> 06:16.550
Sheila, it's folly--

06:16.583 --> 06:17.751
To impose it on others.
To impose it on others.

06:17.784 --> 06:19.052
Got it.

06:19.085 --> 06:21.087
Give me a criminal.
I'm sorry?

06:21.121 --> 06:22.889
I'm not asking
for a murderer.

06:22.923 --> 06:23.990
Just give me
somebody clever.

06:24.024 --> 06:25.692
Give me an embezzler.
I'm an embezzler.

06:25.726 --> 06:27.761
We'll get lunch.

06:27.794 --> 06:30.697
Sheila, it's important
at the beginning

06:30.731 --> 06:32.265
that you keep
a low profile here.

06:32.298 --> 06:34.901
These people
are very reticent.

06:34.935 --> 06:39.506
Just give me a case
to work on.

06:39.540 --> 06:41.775
I don't like to be alone
with my thoughts.

06:51.284 --> 06:52.452
Confess?

06:52.485 --> 06:55.088
Well, wasn't that
your plan, anyway?

06:55.121 --> 06:56.389
You can't be retried.

06:56.422 --> 06:57.858
You're free.

06:57.891 --> 06:59.292
Why not save Emma?

06:59.325 --> 07:02.769
Well, I could be prosecuted
for perjury, Ellenor.

07:02.803 --> 07:05.506
I did testify that
I didn't do it, remember?

07:06.406 --> 07:07.574
If I was to come
forward now

07:07.608 --> 07:10.476
and say that
I was the killer...

07:10.511 --> 07:12.478
Certainly, you're not
gonna allow your daughter

07:12.513 --> 07:13.514
to stay locked up.

07:14.414 --> 07:15.549
My thinking was,

07:15.582 --> 07:17.283
let's see how
Emma's trial goes.

07:17.317 --> 07:19.019
She probably has
a legitimate

07:19.052 --> 07:21.454
temporary insanity
defense.

07:21.487 --> 07:22.823
10 years old?

07:22.856 --> 07:24.390
She figures to be
very sympathetic.

07:24.424 --> 07:26.827
You're gonna let her
stand trial?

07:26.860 --> 07:29.062
I'll testify
on her behalf, Jamie.

07:29.095 --> 07:30.363
I'll talk about
how troubled she was.

07:30.396 --> 07:33.867
Brad, I don't think
that's going to work.

07:33.900 --> 07:36.469
I got myself off.

07:36.503 --> 07:37.838
Now I'll get Emma off.

07:39.072 --> 07:41.274
You keep forgetting
how persuasive I can be.

07:45.646 --> 07:47.514
In my bed,

07:47.548 --> 07:49.449
the two of them.

07:49.482 --> 07:50.717
I since learned

07:50.751 --> 07:52.919
it's been going on
for six years.

07:52.953 --> 07:54.187
How long have
you been married?

07:54.688 --> 07:55.488
Seven.

07:55.522 --> 07:58.124
Roland,

07:58.158 --> 08:00.433
Massachusetts
is a no-fault state,

08:00.466 --> 08:01.367
which basically means

08:01.401 --> 08:03.537
that your wife's infidelity
is a nonissue.

08:04.571 --> 08:05.539
That's what I've been told,

08:05.572 --> 08:08.609
but this was--

08:08.642 --> 08:12.445
she didn't just cheat on me,
Ms. Wilson.

08:12.478 --> 08:14.347
She did so
with my best friend.

08:14.380 --> 08:17.784
He was--he was best man
in our wedding.

08:17.818 --> 08:20.420
This just seems so wrong.

08:20.453 --> 08:23.524
I have two young kids.

08:23.557 --> 08:26.727
For me to come home
and find out my wife...

08:26.760 --> 08:27.528
(sighs)

08:27.561 --> 08:29.896
my children's mother,

08:29.930 --> 08:33.399
to learn it's been going on
for six years?

08:33.433 --> 08:36.202
Roland, it is horrible
what your wife has done.

08:36.236 --> 08:38.572
But unfortunately,
in a no-fault state,

08:38.605 --> 08:40.140
you have no remedy at law
for which--

08:40.173 --> 08:41.474
I'll represent you,
Roland.

08:41.508 --> 08:42.609
Sheila.

08:42.643 --> 08:43.644
And I don't think
we should just

08:43.677 --> 08:45.445
file a claim against her.

08:45.478 --> 08:47.247
I think we should prosecute
that best man as well.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.314
Sheila?

08:48.348 --> 08:51.718
I want you to continue
giving the facts to Tara.

08:51.752 --> 08:55.355
And after that, we'll file
a claim in superior Court.

08:55.388 --> 08:57.323
We can expect a motion
to dismiss.

08:57.357 --> 08:58.592
But surviving that,

08:58.625 --> 08:59.693
discovery should be short,

08:59.726 --> 09:01.467
and we'll be in Court
in three months.

09:03.403 --> 09:04.270
And we can win?

09:04.304 --> 09:06.306
Roland,

09:06.339 --> 09:08.441
look at me.

09:08.474 --> 09:10.611
There's a reason you happened
to walk into this law office

09:10.644 --> 09:13.647
after all those other lawyers
turned you down.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.148
I win my cases.

09:15.181 --> 09:16.216
Not some of them,

09:16.249 --> 09:17.518
not most of them,

09:17.551 --> 09:19.786
every single one of them.

09:19.820 --> 09:22.556
And I shall win this case.

09:29.062 --> 09:30.230
I realize that I'm only

09:30.263 --> 09:31.431
a third-year law student,

09:31.464 --> 09:34.334
but even I know

09:34.367 --> 09:35.502
that public policy

09:35.536 --> 09:37.604
won't let you litigate
domestic disputes and--

09:37.638 --> 09:39.339
CARLISLE: We need to appreciate
on a deeper level

09:39.372 --> 09:42.375
that you are only
a third-year law student.

09:42.408 --> 09:44.545
You see,
every law can be bent,

09:44.578 --> 09:45.812
folded, or manipulated,

09:45.846 --> 09:47.681
so long as it conforms

09:47.714 --> 09:49.983
to fairness.

09:50.016 --> 09:52.285
So instead of taking issue,

09:52.318 --> 09:54.555
perhaps you would like to seize
the opportunity to learn.

09:56.923 --> 09:58.258
You see, Tara,

09:58.291 --> 10:00.166
I will win.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.569
Aren't you just fascinated
to see how?

10:06.339 --> 10:07.240
(door opens)

10:08.241 --> 10:09.309
All you need
is one more drink,

10:09.342 --> 10:11.411
and we're having
a pool party.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.146
I'm not that drunk.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.247
We can fix that right up.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.718
Although I did see you
sort of stumble out of the cab,

10:17.751 --> 10:20.554
not that I don't welcome you
to stumble on over

10:20.587 --> 10:22.288
whenever you feel the urge.

10:25.491 --> 10:26.593
Ellenor,

10:28.862 --> 10:29.896
what are you doing here?

10:30.496 --> 10:32.265
You know,

10:33.600 --> 10:36.069
I have freed murderers,

10:36.102 --> 10:37.504
rapists,

10:38.404 --> 10:41.107
and I usually end up
sleeping at night because...

10:41.141 --> 10:44.778
I know my role
in the system.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.981
You know, I'm the
defense attorney up against

10:48.014 --> 10:49.583
the police state and all.

10:51.217 --> 10:52.418
I sleep.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.656
I never have trouble
sleeping.

10:56.557 --> 10:57.490
But?

10:59.025 --> 11:01.968
How do I let
a 10-year-old girl

11:02.002 --> 11:03.469
spend her life

11:03.504 --> 11:05.005
in juvenile hall,

11:06.740 --> 11:08.041
when I know

11:08.074 --> 11:09.776
that makes me...

11:11.778 --> 11:13.013
(inhales sharply)

11:14.715 --> 11:16.216
You know what I am, Alan?

11:17.551 --> 11:18.418
Drunk?

11:18.451 --> 11:20.420
A monster.

11:21.688 --> 11:24.424
If I can let a child,

11:24.457 --> 11:25.826
then I have to wear
the badge

11:25.859 --> 11:27.828
that "I am a monster."

11:28.595 --> 11:31.131
This is a beautiful,

11:31.164 --> 11:32.065
blossoming girl.

11:32.098 --> 11:33.934
She's a--

11:33.967 --> 11:36.069
she's a child.

11:36.102 --> 11:38.404
She's the future
of our country.

11:38.438 --> 11:40.173
(sniffling)

11:40.206 --> 11:42.509
Maybe we're both gonna need
another drink.

11:42.543 --> 11:44.277
You know,
I'm a terrible drinker,

11:44.310 --> 11:46.613
because I never drink.

11:46.647 --> 11:47.948
(chuckles)

11:47.981 --> 11:49.382
You'll stay here
tonight.

11:50.851 --> 11:52.819
Alan,

11:52.853 --> 11:54.454
I am not having sex
with you.

11:54.487 --> 11:55.556
That's all right.

11:55.589 --> 11:56.757
Did you bring any friends?

11:57.924 --> 11:59.926
Come on, it's late.

11:59.960 --> 12:00.967
Let's get you inside.

12:01.001 --> 12:02.736
I just wanted your advice.

12:02.769 --> 12:03.870
(laughs)

12:03.904 --> 12:05.739
I'm not sure that
I can keep my mouth shut.

12:06.507 --> 12:09.075
I don't want to be
disbarred, but--

12:09.109 --> 12:10.276
whoa.

12:10.310 --> 12:11.778
(water splashes)

12:12.312 --> 12:14.781
(dog barking)

12:20.521 --> 12:22.055
And we're going
to Court now?

12:22.088 --> 12:24.324
CARLISLE: I've filed for
a temporary restraining order.

12:24.357 --> 12:26.326
Injunctive relief
gets you right in.

12:26.359 --> 12:29.963
Now, I expect them to file
their motion to dismiss.

12:29.996 --> 12:32.165
I don't mind waiving notice
on that as long as--

12:32.198 --> 12:33.600
Are they gonna be there?

12:33.634 --> 12:34.768
Who?

12:34.801 --> 12:36.469
My wife and Richard.

12:36.503 --> 12:38.404
They might.

12:38.438 --> 12:39.472
Will that be a problem?

12:39.506 --> 12:43.076
It's hard for me
to see them.

12:43.109 --> 12:45.111
I don't know
if I'm ready to see them.

12:45.145 --> 12:47.247
I'll handle things.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.615
You just stand there

12:48.649 --> 12:50.450
and look as sad as you can.

12:53.820 --> 12:55.789
I said no clients.

12:55.822 --> 12:57.157
I couldn't stop her.

12:57.190 --> 12:58.525
You should have come
and got me.

12:58.559 --> 13:00.934
And you, you said
you'd be watching her.

13:00.967 --> 13:02.268
SHORE: She already
filed a complaint.

13:02.302 --> 13:04.505
Yes, and she thinks that
she's gonna win. She even--

13:04.538 --> 13:06.272
Hold on a second.
She said that?

13:06.306 --> 13:07.140
She thinks she'll win?

13:07.173 --> 13:09.309
Yes.
What's the problem?

13:09.342 --> 13:10.476
If Sheila says
she's gonna win,

13:10.511 --> 13:11.812
she wins, no exceptions.

13:11.845 --> 13:13.379
Did you hear the cause
of action?

13:13.413 --> 13:14.881
SHORE: I don't care
what the cause is.

13:14.915 --> 13:16.750
If she promises victory,

13:16.783 --> 13:17.751
you've won.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.457
Tara, come with us.

13:24.490 --> 13:25.358
You need to learn.

13:29.029 --> 13:30.664
Oh.

13:30.697 --> 13:32.165
Don't talk to me,

13:32.198 --> 13:33.166
ever.

13:33.199 --> 13:34.134
If you have something to say,

13:34.167 --> 13:35.401
just put it in a note.

13:36.903 --> 13:39.139
Just a guess,
but I'd say she got looped

13:39.172 --> 13:40.206
and fell in a pool.

13:42.108 --> 13:43.544
I want you in Court

13:43.577 --> 13:45.145
backing Sheila now.

13:45.178 --> 13:47.213
I've got an appointment.

13:47.247 --> 13:48.281
Tara will be there.

13:48.314 --> 13:51.151
Eugene,
she doesn't need help,

13:51.184 --> 13:52.853
not in that room.

13:58.458 --> 14:01.001
This is
a domestic dispute.

14:01.034 --> 14:03.003
We're in
a no-fault state.

14:03.036 --> 14:05.271
This is a rift
between a husband and wife.

14:05.305 --> 14:07.373
Your Honor, he's telling you
things you already know.

14:07.407 --> 14:08.942
I'd ask that he respect
the robe

14:08.975 --> 14:10.243
and value your time.

14:10.276 --> 14:12.145
You're the one
taking my time, counsel,

14:12.178 --> 14:13.880
with this untenable claim.

14:13.914 --> 14:16.116
The restatement
of torts recognizes

14:16.149 --> 14:18.084
a valid claim against one,

14:18.118 --> 14:19.520
who, by extreme

14:19.553 --> 14:21.054
and outrageous conduct,

14:21.087 --> 14:22.889
intentionally
or recklessly

14:22.923 --> 14:26.459
causes severe emotional
distress to another.

14:26.492 --> 14:29.429
There is no immunity
for married people.

14:29.462 --> 14:32.065
No exception for
domestic disputes.

14:32.098 --> 14:33.399
COLLINS: Your Honor,
the Court of law

14:33.433 --> 14:36.169
is a hallowed forum
to litigate serious

14:36.202 --> 14:38.138
legal judicial disputes.

14:38.171 --> 14:40.541
CARLISLE: Oh, yes,
the hallowed forum defense.

14:40.574 --> 14:43.043
Oprah was sued
for criticizing meat.

14:43.076 --> 14:44.611
McDonald's
was sued and lost

14:44.645 --> 14:46.212
for serving coffee
that was too hot.

14:46.246 --> 14:48.481
The hallowed forum

14:48.515 --> 14:51.217
entertains any claim
that is valid,

14:51.251 --> 14:52.686
as is the one

14:52.719 --> 14:54.187
that is
before you today.

14:56.022 --> 14:57.991
All right.

14:58.024 --> 15:01.167
The T. R. O. nonsense
is dismissed.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.570
On the underlying claim,
I want to hear from Mr. Huff.

15:03.604 --> 15:05.438
COLLINS: Your Honor--

15:05.471 --> 15:07.240
BROWN: You're asking me
to throw this out, counsel.

15:07.273 --> 15:09.209
I wanna conduct
a short evidentiary hearing

15:09.242 --> 15:11.044
before I do so.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.145
2:00.

15:14.781 --> 15:17.117
Well, progress.

15:17.150 --> 15:17.918
(inhales sharply)

15:17.951 --> 15:19.419
Breathe life's juice.

15:20.621 --> 15:21.354
Now let's go.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.463
He didn't tell me about you.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.633
Well, maybe he didn't
even know I'd be coming.

15:32.666 --> 15:34.801
Maybe he thought it would be
Ellenor or Jamie,

15:34.835 --> 15:35.769
who I work with.

15:37.838 --> 15:39.239
Emma,

15:39.272 --> 15:41.174
I know about
the little plan.

15:41.207 --> 15:43.309
And may I say,
I admire you.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.811
What a wonderful daughter
you must be

15:44.845 --> 15:46.146
to protect your dad
like this.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.714
You're a true hero.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.484
But now, in preparation

15:51.518 --> 15:53.854
for your dad
to protect you,

15:53.887 --> 15:55.789
we have to get our statements
exactly right

15:55.822 --> 15:57.924
to protect you both
against perjury.

16:01.034 --> 16:03.169
So, here's your dad's
statement.

16:06.707 --> 16:09.610
And I need you
to look it over

16:09.643 --> 16:12.579
and tell me how
it's going to compare to yours.

16:12.613 --> 16:15.549
(music playing)

16:20.053 --> 16:21.722
Did you trick this girl?

16:21.755 --> 16:23.423
I persuaded her
to tell the truth.

16:26.660 --> 16:27.994
I might have used
a little trickery.

16:28.929 --> 16:30.296
And this is my statement.

16:30.330 --> 16:31.364
It's hearsay,

16:31.397 --> 16:33.834
since Mr. Stanfield
didn't confess to me directly.

16:33.867 --> 16:35.235
But I think you'll find--
Hold on just a second,

16:35.268 --> 16:36.269
would you, please?

16:39.105 --> 16:40.641
This would be privileged.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.377
You're a member
of Ms. Frutt's firm.

16:44.410 --> 16:45.612
Anything she told you do--

16:45.646 --> 16:47.581
I haven't even gotten
to the good part.

16:47.614 --> 16:49.315
Since Mr. Stanfield
accomplished

16:49.349 --> 16:51.117
his mistrial through fraud,

16:51.151 --> 16:52.753
double jeopardy
does not attach.

16:52.786 --> 16:54.354
You can try him
all over again

16:54.387 --> 16:55.856
on double murder,

16:55.889 --> 16:57.958
and this time,
you'll have my testimony.

17:00.534 --> 17:02.503
Mr. Shore,

17:02.536 --> 17:03.637
I will give you
the opportunity

17:03.670 --> 17:04.637
to take this all back,
because--

17:04.671 --> 17:06.607
That's not gonna happen.

17:06.640 --> 17:08.942
I'll have no choice
but to report you to the bar.

17:08.974 --> 17:10.310
That's fine,

17:10.343 --> 17:12.145
but you will use this.

17:12.178 --> 17:14.681
You will probably
lose your license.

17:16.883 --> 17:18.885
I've always wanted
to farm apples.

17:20.286 --> 17:21.755
Cortland, not McIntosh,

17:21.788 --> 17:23.624
they make for
a much tarter crisp.

17:25.526 --> 17:27.027
There's a little girl

17:27.060 --> 17:29.362
in a juvenile facility,
Mr. Campbell.

17:29.395 --> 17:30.897
Send for her.

17:30.931 --> 17:33.266
Then send for Mr. Stanfield.

17:33.299 --> 17:35.669
Then you can have the bar
send for me.

17:35.702 --> 17:38.639
(music playing)

17:48.448 --> 17:49.950
REPORTER (over TV):
In a stunning development,

17:49.983 --> 17:52.052
we've now learned
that Brad Stanfield

17:52.085 --> 17:55.155
has been rearrested
for the murder of his wife

17:55.188 --> 17:56.489
and unborn son.

17:56.523 --> 17:59.960
Sources say
Mr. Stanfield's own lawyers

17:59.993 --> 18:02.536
provided information
leading to the arrest.

18:02.569 --> 18:03.904
I did nothing, I swear.

18:03.937 --> 18:05.772
REPORTER (over TV):
...to be arraigned at 2:30.

18:05.806 --> 18:07.541
You may remember
earlier charges

18:07.741 --> 18:08.775
against Mr. Stanfield...
Jamie?

18:08.809 --> 18:11.277
I didn't say anything.

18:11.311 --> 18:12.746
Hello.

18:15.148 --> 18:16.650
Did I miss
something interesting?

18:17.417 --> 18:19.219
Alan,

18:19.252 --> 18:21.522
did you talk to the D. A.
about Stanfield?

18:21.555 --> 18:23.557
I might have mentioned
he confessed.

18:26.860 --> 18:28.829
Please come to my office.

18:28.862 --> 18:31.798
(music playing)

18:33.166 --> 18:34.835
(door opens)

18:48.048 --> 18:49.916
You don't really know me,
Mr. Shore.

18:52.052 --> 18:54.387
Eugene, I know you don't
want me here,

18:54.420 --> 18:56.456
and now I've given you

18:56.489 --> 18:57.891
a perfect reason
to fire me.

18:57.924 --> 18:59.726
Ellenor would
certainly understand.

19:00.734 --> 19:02.368
I would appreciate

19:02.402 --> 19:04.037
the courtesy of my discharge

19:04.070 --> 19:06.973
being a reflective
decision, however,

19:07.007 --> 19:09.442
so if you could
at least wait

19:09.475 --> 19:10.944
until your anger subsides,

19:10.977 --> 19:12.145
I'd be grateful.

19:20.353 --> 19:21.755
(door closes)

19:23.624 --> 19:25.592
He's not looking well
at all.

19:28.529 --> 19:29.563
What's going on, Roland?

19:30.230 --> 19:32.432
I wasn't prepared for
seeing them like that,

19:32.465 --> 19:34.034
how it would make me feel.

19:34.067 --> 19:36.136
I don't know
if I can testify

19:36.169 --> 19:38.839
in some big public thing.

19:38.872 --> 19:39.740
I don't know.

19:40.607 --> 19:41.542
Take my hand, Roland.

19:41.642 --> 19:45.411
I just don't like the way
I'm feeling now.

19:45.445 --> 19:49.149
Why don't you just speak
directly to me?

19:49.182 --> 19:50.216
Tell me your story.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.786
Pretend I'm the only one
in the room.

19:52.819 --> 19:56.723
Seeing the two of them
sitting together like that...

19:56.757 --> 19:58.024
I'll tell you what,

19:59.092 --> 20:00.667
you just look at me.

20:02.102 --> 20:03.770
Tell me your story.

20:07.708 --> 20:09.175
I think the worst part was

20:09.209 --> 20:12.045
I thought everything
was wonderful.

20:12.078 --> 20:14.948
CARLISLE: Were you two
having sexual relations?

20:14.981 --> 20:15.949
ROLAND: No,

20:15.982 --> 20:17.684
because she--

20:17.718 --> 20:19.019
CARLISLE: Roland,

20:19.052 --> 20:20.220
look at me, please.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.256
She said
she couldn't have sex

20:23.289 --> 20:25.258
because she had
a fibroid condition.

20:25.291 --> 20:27.260
And I accepted it.

20:27.293 --> 20:28.729
CARLISLE: How did you learn
of your wife's affair

20:28.762 --> 20:29.730
with Mr. Ward?

20:29.763 --> 20:32.599
I came home from work early
one day,

20:34.334 --> 20:35.836
trying to surprise her.

20:35.869 --> 20:37.303
I had a plan.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.105
I was gonna take her out
to dinner.

20:39.139 --> 20:41.107
When I got home,
I saw Richard's car

20:41.141 --> 20:42.576
parked out in front.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.010
I didn't think
anything of it.

20:44.044 --> 20:45.646
He comes over
all the time.

20:45.679 --> 20:47.147
He's...

20:47.180 --> 20:48.281
my best friend.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.518
I figured he came over
to borrow something.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.220
Well, I went in, and...

20:54.254 --> 20:57.057
I heard music
coming from upstairs.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.092
Actually,

20:59.125 --> 21:00.567
it was my very, very
favorite song,

21:00.601 --> 21:02.135
"The Peppermint Twist".

21:02.168 --> 21:03.937
And so I headed up.

21:05.005 --> 21:09.042
Well, other sounds got louder
as I got closer,

21:09.075 --> 21:11.878
and when I went in,
I saw them.

21:13.914 --> 21:16.950
Richard and my wife...

21:16.983 --> 21:18.719
were having intercourse

21:18.752 --> 21:21.755
in my house in my bed.

21:21.788 --> 21:23.156
And then what happened?

21:23.189 --> 21:25.258
Well, they'd looked at me,

21:25.291 --> 21:26.627
they stopped,

21:29.863 --> 21:32.098
and they started up again.

21:32.132 --> 21:34.768
Right there,
with you in the room?

21:35.769 --> 21:37.470
Yes.

21:37.504 --> 21:39.606
Yes.

21:39.640 --> 21:42.375
They didn't even have
the decency to stop.

21:50.483 --> 21:52.786
KING: Anything said to Mr. Shore
by the other lawyers

21:52.819 --> 21:54.187
would be an extension
of privilege.

21:54.220 --> 21:56.523
This was not state action,
Your Honor.

21:56.557 --> 21:58.324
Any breach committed
by Mr. Shore

21:58.358 --> 22:01.201
is actionable against
Mr. Shore civilly.

22:01.234 --> 22:03.870
We should not, however,
be banned from using

22:03.904 --> 22:04.905
the information.

22:04.938 --> 22:06.607
This would violate
every principle of fairness

22:06.640 --> 22:08.441
for my client to be re-tried.

22:08.474 --> 22:12.178
Counsel,
if this information is true,

22:12.212 --> 22:16.016
your client conspired to let
his 10-year-old daughter

22:16.049 --> 22:18.885
take the fall for
a double murder he committed.

22:18.919 --> 22:21.922
I don't think you mean
to play the fairness card.

22:25.191 --> 22:27.493
I see attorneys Frutt
and Stringer.

22:27.528 --> 22:30.997
I'll see you and counsel
in chambers now.

22:31.031 --> 22:33.466
Mr. Stanfield,
you'll stay in custody.

22:35.368 --> 22:39.305
(music playing)

22:54.788 --> 22:57.390
Does Mr. Shore report
the facts correctly?

22:57.423 --> 23:00.601
Privilege prevents me
from either confirming

23:00.634 --> 23:02.936
or denying Mr. Shore's
allegations.

23:03.904 --> 23:05.739
Ms. Frutt...

23:05.772 --> 23:09.275
we have a serious
problem here.

23:09.309 --> 23:11.444
If that little girl took
the stand and decided

23:11.477 --> 23:12.979
on her own to lie,

23:13.013 --> 23:15.181
then double jeopardy
attaches.

23:15.215 --> 23:17.951
And Mr. Stanfield
goes free.

23:17.984 --> 23:20.854
If he conspired to commit
the fraud, however,

23:20.887 --> 23:23.489
double jeopardy
does not attach,

23:23.524 --> 23:25.058
and he can be re-tried.

23:25.091 --> 23:26.459
We understand that,
Your Honor, but--

23:26.492 --> 23:28.529
You stepped outside
your role as advocates

23:28.562 --> 23:30.631
and stood before me
as officers of the Court.

23:30.664 --> 23:32.432
Which we deeply regret.

23:32.465 --> 23:34.500
I am not interested
in remorse.

23:34.535 --> 23:36.336
Your Honor--
I'm not speaking to you,

23:36.369 --> 23:37.370
Mr. King.

23:39.439 --> 23:41.508
Without asking you
to reveal privilege,

23:41.542 --> 23:43.610
I would like you
to either confirm or deny

23:43.644 --> 23:45.712
what you said to me
as officers of the Court.

23:47.047 --> 23:49.382
All I will say,

23:49.415 --> 23:52.318
we believed our representations
to be true.

23:52.853 --> 23:55.021
Whether we continue

23:55.055 --> 23:57.758
to believe them to be true,

23:57.791 --> 23:59.860
privilege prevents us
from saying.

24:03.303 --> 24:06.472
Mr. King...

24:06.507 --> 24:08.441
it is my finding
the mistrial

24:08.474 --> 24:10.376
was procured by fraud.

24:10.410 --> 24:12.713
Double jeopardy will,
therefore, not attach.

24:12.746 --> 24:14.180
Your client will be re-tried.

24:14.214 --> 24:16.783
Mr. Campbell,
get the girl out of jail.

24:17.884 --> 24:20.220
Ms. Frutt, tell Mr. Shore

24:20.253 --> 24:23.156
that I am recommending him
for immediate disbarment.

24:26.259 --> 24:28.361
Why does she get to testify?

24:28.394 --> 24:31.364
I mean, why does she get
to tell her story?

24:31.397 --> 24:32.866
It's a good sign that the Judge

24:32.899 --> 24:34.134
wants to hear from her,
Roland.

24:34.167 --> 24:36.069
It means they're
considering our case.

24:36.102 --> 24:38.505
You know, I don't even know
if I wanna do this anymore.

24:38.539 --> 24:40.040
I thought it would
make me feel better,

24:40.073 --> 24:42.408
but it's only making me
feel worse.

24:42.442 --> 24:44.344
I'm getting
very angry feelings,

24:44.377 --> 24:45.846
and I don't like it
when I feel this way.

24:45.879 --> 24:47.748
Big breath, just--
I don't wanna suck

24:47.781 --> 24:49.215
life's juice!

24:50.250 --> 24:51.351
Roland...

24:53.453 --> 24:54.855
I think that you wanted
to do this

24:54.888 --> 24:57.223
because you felt victimized.

24:57.257 --> 24:59.760
And that could be what's been
making you feel angry.

24:59.793 --> 25:02.435
Now, you can certainly
quit now,

25:02.468 --> 25:04.470
but it might end up
making you feel

25:04.505 --> 25:05.839
even more angry.

25:10.911 --> 25:12.178
Alan...

25:13.413 --> 25:15.181
you betrayed me.

25:15.215 --> 25:16.883
Did I?

25:16.917 --> 25:17.951
Sorry.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.385
Don't be flip.

25:19.419 --> 25:22.789
I came to you in distress,
in confidence,

25:22.823 --> 25:23.724
because I had a problem
that I--

25:23.757 --> 25:25.592
Which I shared.

25:25.626 --> 25:26.993
You couldn't live
with the child

25:27.027 --> 25:28.929
being falsely imprisoned.

25:28.962 --> 25:29.763
Neither could I.

25:29.796 --> 25:30.964
You should have come
to me for--

25:30.997 --> 25:33.266
In which case, you might
be facing disbarment.

25:33.299 --> 25:35.902
Perhaps you could say,
"Thanks for the insulation."

25:35.936 --> 25:38.539
BERLUTI:
But you didn't insulate her.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.474
What you did
goes to this firm,

25:41.508 --> 25:43.343
our reputation,

25:43.376 --> 25:44.811
and it's damaged.

25:44.845 --> 25:46.146
You're right, Jimmy.

25:46.179 --> 25:47.413
I'm sorry.

25:47.447 --> 25:48.915
How about a hug?

25:48.949 --> 25:50.316
BERLUTI: I'm gonna pop
this guy, I swear.

25:50.350 --> 25:52.285
I'm just gonna hit him.

25:52.318 --> 25:54.254
YOUNG: What time's
the hearing before the bar?

25:54.287 --> 25:55.722
10:00 AM.

25:55.756 --> 25:56.923
Have you retained counsel?

25:56.957 --> 25:58.491
I'll represent myself.

25:58.525 --> 26:00.801
And what are you
going to say?

26:00.834 --> 26:03.970
Exactly what I feel
at the moment.

26:04.004 --> 26:08.241
Your conduct speaks
to the integrity of this firm.

26:08.274 --> 26:09.543
You need to get that.

26:11.411 --> 26:12.345
Got it.

26:15.616 --> 26:19.085
I'm not proud of it,

26:19.119 --> 26:21.221
but I fell in love.

26:21.254 --> 26:23.857
It happens sometimes
in marriage.

26:23.890 --> 26:25.526
People have affairs.

26:26.827 --> 26:28.695
I'm sorry I hurt Roland

26:28.729 --> 26:30.296
and, of course, my children,

26:30.330 --> 26:32.265
but I fell in love.

26:32.298 --> 26:35.536
But when Roland came
into the room,

26:35.569 --> 26:38.839
did you really continue
to have relations?

26:38.872 --> 26:41.207
You know, I really don't
believe we did.

26:41.241 --> 26:44.611
But this is embarrassing
to talk about,

26:44.645 --> 26:46.346
but when you're about
to climax,

26:46.379 --> 26:48.348
you're not completely
in control of your faculties.

26:48.381 --> 26:50.450
All I can say...

26:50.483 --> 26:53.353
(sighs)

26:53.386 --> 26:55.989
I never meant to hurt Roland.

26:56.022 --> 26:57.758
He's a dear man.

26:57.791 --> 26:59.392
I love him.

26:59.425 --> 27:01.334
I just--

27:01.367 --> 27:02.669
Fell in love...

27:02.703 --> 27:04.404
quickly, I might add.

27:04.437 --> 27:07.373
After about a year of being
married to this man,

27:07.407 --> 27:09.175
having children,
you were having an affair

27:09.209 --> 27:10.711
with his best friend.

27:10.744 --> 27:11.745
Yes.

27:11.778 --> 27:12.813
Best friend?

27:12.846 --> 27:13.479
Yes.

27:13.514 --> 27:14.781
Why not get a divorce?

27:14.815 --> 27:17.217
Why have children

27:17.250 --> 27:19.419
if you were in love
with somebody else?

27:19.452 --> 27:22.388
That was probably
not a wise decision, but--

27:22.422 --> 27:24.525
You made it when you were
about to climax.

27:24.558 --> 27:26.292
COLLINS: Objection!
CARLISLE: Getting a divorce

27:26.326 --> 27:28.394
would have cost you a lot
of money, right, Nance?

27:28.428 --> 27:29.996
Roland had lots.

27:30.030 --> 27:31.397
You had none.

27:31.431 --> 27:33.734
And the best man
was unemployed.

27:33.767 --> 27:35.569
This was never about money.

27:35.602 --> 27:38.772
No, simply love,
just all about love.

27:38.805 --> 27:40.473
Tell me something, Nance,

27:40.507 --> 27:44.645
how did you not get caught
for six years?

27:44.678 --> 27:46.547
Wow, six years,

27:46.580 --> 27:49.015
that's a really long time

27:49.049 --> 27:51.417
to pull off a lie.
Objection!

27:51.451 --> 27:55.355
CARLISLE: Six years, she screwed
his best friend in his bed.

27:55.388 --> 27:56.456
Objection!

27:56.489 --> 27:59.192
Your Honor, why are you not
ruling on my objections?

27:59.225 --> 28:00.266
Oh, all right.

28:00.300 --> 28:01.802
Sustained.

28:01.835 --> 28:04.671
Dial it back, Ms. Carlisle.

28:04.705 --> 28:07.641
People fall in love, Nancy.

28:07.674 --> 28:08.809
I get that.

28:10.010 --> 28:13.580
Fall victim to passion.

28:13.614 --> 28:15.816
But this...

28:15.849 --> 28:18.885
this was six years

28:18.919 --> 28:20.220
of careful planning

28:20.253 --> 28:22.623
to avoid detection.

28:22.656 --> 28:24.725
This was reflective,

28:24.758 --> 28:26.860
orchestrated,

28:26.893 --> 28:29.863
premeditated deceit.

28:31.765 --> 28:34.768
Don't you dare clump that

28:34.801 --> 28:36.937
under the banner of "love."

28:39.039 --> 28:41.307
This was evil.

28:41.341 --> 28:43.476
You are an evil person.

28:43.510 --> 28:44.911
COLLINS: Objection.

28:44.945 --> 28:49.616
Your Honor, God would like
to apologize to the Court.

28:49.650 --> 28:52.118
She says she's terribly
overextended.

28:52.152 --> 28:55.756
And sometimes,
when she's spread too thin...

28:57.791 --> 29:00.026
people like Nancy happen.

29:22.989 --> 29:24.190
He wants to see me?

29:24.224 --> 29:25.759
STRINGER: And only you.

29:25.992 --> 29:26.860
What's going on?

29:26.893 --> 29:29.329
Brad Stanfield
asked to see me.

29:29.362 --> 29:30.296
You can't.

29:30.330 --> 29:31.497
I mean, he's represented
by counsel, and--

29:31.532 --> 29:33.299
He waived it.

29:33.333 --> 29:35.201
Sheila, Judge Brown's
office called.

29:35.235 --> 29:36.036
She's ruling at 10:00.

29:36.069 --> 29:37.303
Okay.

29:38.639 --> 29:39.640
How's she doing?

29:39.673 --> 29:42.543
Fabulous, although she got
a little religious

29:42.576 --> 29:43.844
at the end of her cross.

29:43.877 --> 29:46.847
Nuts religious or just...

29:46.880 --> 29:48.381
I couldn't tell.

29:51.217 --> 29:54.487
The problem
with this lawsuit,

29:54.521 --> 29:56.690
every husband will start
suing his ex-wife

29:56.723 --> 29:58.992
as a way to circumvent alimony.

29:59.025 --> 30:01.668
We may get to the point
where husbands even entrap

30:01.702 --> 30:03.937
their wives into having affairs

30:03.970 --> 30:06.873
so they can avoid
losing their houses.

30:06.907 --> 30:09.309
This is why we have no-fault,

30:09.342 --> 30:11.712
why the Court
doesn't even wanna go there,

30:11.745 --> 30:13.947
asking who's to blame.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.650
However...

30:16.683 --> 30:20.320
divorce law should not be used
to shield a person

30:20.353 --> 30:22.322
when he engages in egregious,

30:22.355 --> 30:24.290
outrageous conduct

30:24.324 --> 30:27.360
to the emotional detriment
of others.

30:27.393 --> 30:31.464
Six years
with his best friend?

30:31.497 --> 30:33.266
Ms. Huff...

30:35.869 --> 30:37.203
I'm sorry.

30:37.237 --> 30:39.305
A jury might throw this out,

30:39.339 --> 30:41.407
but I won't.

30:41.441 --> 30:43.944
The motion to dismiss is denied.

30:49.449 --> 30:51.217
I don't believe it.

30:51.251 --> 30:52.586
We've got a long
way to go.

30:52.619 --> 30:54.521
With three months minimum
on discovery,

30:54.555 --> 30:56.256
you've got to decide
if you wanna settle,

30:56.289 --> 30:57.924
but the leverage
is ours, Roland.

30:57.958 --> 30:59.626
NANCY:
You think you've won, Roland?

30:59.660 --> 31:01.568
You're represented
by counsel, Miss--

31:01.602 --> 31:02.468
I don't care.

31:02.503 --> 31:04.137
Drop this now, Roland,

31:04.170 --> 31:05.238
or you'll lose the kids.

31:05.271 --> 31:07.541
CARLISLE: I don't think
that's your call, Nance.

31:07.574 --> 31:08.909
You think
you know everything?

31:08.942 --> 31:11.712
Certainly not,
just a little more than most.

31:13.947 --> 31:15.616
Little news flash, Roland.

31:15.649 --> 31:17.350
The kids aren't yours.

31:17.383 --> 31:18.184
They're Richard's.

31:18.218 --> 31:19.586
Nancy.
What?

31:19.620 --> 31:20.320
NANCY: Yeah.

31:21.287 --> 31:23.156
So drop this case, Roland,

31:23.189 --> 31:24.591
or you'll never see them again.

31:27.227 --> 31:29.495
It wasn't
a master plan, Roland.

31:29.530 --> 31:30.931
It just happened.

31:30.964 --> 31:34.668
NANCY: Didn't you even wonder
why they don't look like you,

31:34.701 --> 31:35.869
not even slightly?

31:36.870 --> 31:38.371
CARLISLE: All right,
talk time's over.

31:39.706 --> 31:41.742
You're not looking
so smug anymore.

31:43.510 --> 31:44.444
Come on, Richard.

31:48.381 --> 31:49.049
All right.

31:50.483 --> 31:52.719
I want you to drop
by the office, Roland,

31:52.753 --> 31:54.921
and we will figure out
your legal options.

31:55.656 --> 31:58.559
Tara, I want you to do
some research.

31:58.592 --> 31:59.225
Done.

32:00.060 --> 32:02.435
Roland, look at me.

32:04.871 --> 32:07.608
I told you in the beginning
I'd take care of you,

32:07.641 --> 32:09.242
and I will.

32:12.946 --> 32:15.949
MAN: You turned in
your own client?

32:15.982 --> 32:17.150
SHORE: I did.

32:18.552 --> 32:19.686
Do you have any defense?

32:19.720 --> 32:21.221
No.

32:22.422 --> 32:26.192
That's all you have
to say to us, "no."

32:26.226 --> 32:27.828
Well, I thought
if I saved time,

32:27.861 --> 32:28.862
you might go easier.

32:28.895 --> 32:32.332
Mr. Shore, if you find
this amusing--

32:32.365 --> 32:35.135
I find it preposterous,
Your Honor.

32:35.168 --> 32:37.571
A 10-year-old girl climbs
into the witness chair

32:37.604 --> 32:39.205
to declare herself the killer,

32:39.239 --> 32:41.508
the daughter of the defendant.

32:41.542 --> 32:42.543
And what happens?

32:42.576 --> 32:44.010
The Judge says mistrial,

32:44.044 --> 32:45.345
the child goes to jail,

32:45.378 --> 32:48.048
and the only thing
horrifying you

32:48.949 --> 32:51.317
is that I revealed
the double murderer's secret.

32:51.351 --> 32:53.720
Yes, Mr. Shore,
because privilege--

32:53.754 --> 32:57.323
Privilege is fundamental
to the system.

32:58.324 --> 33:00.701
Problem is, Judge,
the system is a disaster.

33:00.734 --> 33:03.837
We have over 10,000
wrongful convictions--

33:03.870 --> 33:04.871
You're not helping yourself.

33:04.905 --> 33:06.773
SHORE: And who might you
be helping, Judge?

33:09.810 --> 33:10.744
Your Honor.

33:12.278 --> 33:13.547
May I be heard?

33:13.580 --> 33:14.915
Who are you?

33:16.149 --> 33:17.483
My name is Eugene Young.

33:17.518 --> 33:20.053
Mr. Shore is a member
of our firm, and as such,

33:20.086 --> 33:22.856
I believe I have standing
to address this tribunal.

33:22.889 --> 33:25.692
And Mr. Shore was doing
so well without you.

33:28.228 --> 33:31.598
I, like this tribunal,
believe lawyer/client privilege

33:31.632 --> 33:33.066
to be sacrosanct,

33:33.099 --> 33:34.701
and that there could be
no greater violation

33:34.735 --> 33:38.371
to this process
than the breach of that trust.

33:38.404 --> 33:39.372
But, Your Honors,

33:39.405 --> 33:41.742
in order for there
to be a breach,

33:41.775 --> 33:44.578
there has to be an underlying
trust to begin with.

33:44.611 --> 33:45.712
Here there wasn't.

33:45.746 --> 33:48.248
Brad Stanfield lied
to Ellenor Frutt

33:48.281 --> 33:49.115
and Jamie Stringer.

33:49.149 --> 33:51.417
He deceived them
for the express purpose

33:51.451 --> 33:52.686
of defrauding the Court.

33:52.719 --> 33:54.888
The fact that
they couldn't trust him

33:54.921 --> 33:56.957
doesn't mean
he wasn't trusting them.

33:56.990 --> 33:59.826
Well, I would submit,
a fiduciary relationship

33:59.860 --> 34:01.568
has to be somewhat mutual.

34:01.602 --> 34:03.570
Beyond that, Alan Shore
had the legal right

34:03.604 --> 34:06.039
to reveal
Mr. Stanfield's secret.

34:06.072 --> 34:07.040
And how do you get that?

34:07.073 --> 34:09.208
Well...

34:09.242 --> 34:10.577
directing
the Court's attention

34:10.610 --> 34:13.313
to the rules
of professional conduct,

34:13.346 --> 34:17.317
rule number 1.6(b)(1).

34:18.083 --> 34:20.286
In one state in this country,

34:20.320 --> 34:22.088
a lawyer may break
client privilege

34:22.121 --> 34:25.726
to prevent the wrongful
incarceration of another.

34:25.759 --> 34:27.661
That state
is Massachusetts.

34:27.694 --> 34:30.330
FLYNN: Mr. Young,
that is an obscure exception,

34:30.362 --> 34:31.397
which, to my knowledge,

34:31.431 --> 34:32.966
has never been relied
upon, ever.

34:32.998 --> 34:34.735
But it is there.

34:34.768 --> 34:36.002
It is written.

34:36.036 --> 34:37.704
The fact that Mr. Shore
is the first to invoke

34:37.737 --> 34:40.072
it does not undermine
its validity.

34:40.106 --> 34:43.577
Technically,
Alan Shore acted legally.

34:43.610 --> 34:46.947
And moreover, Your Honor,
he acted morally.

34:46.980 --> 34:49.349
He did the right thing.

34:49.382 --> 34:52.686
The three of you speak
of prioritizing trust.

34:52.719 --> 34:55.556
But what about the public trust
in our profession?

34:55.589 --> 34:57.591
What about
the erosion of respect

34:57.624 --> 34:59.192
for who and what we are?

34:59.225 --> 35:01.935
Alan Shore is an honorable man.

35:01.968 --> 35:03.637
He saw an unspeakable wrong.

35:03.670 --> 35:06.807
A child imprisoned
for something she didn't commit.

35:06.840 --> 35:08.274
And he acted to right it.

35:08.308 --> 35:11.044
He acted within both
the technical bounds of the law

35:11.077 --> 35:12.779
and the moral bounds
of decency.

35:12.813 --> 35:14.981
Accordingly,
he should neither be suspended,

35:15.015 --> 35:17.851
nor expelled from practice,
because he is just.

35:21.755 --> 35:23.757
He is just.

35:28.461 --> 35:30.731
And, Your Honors...

35:30.764 --> 35:33.867
you need to reach into
yourselves like Alan Shore did,

35:36.236 --> 35:37.638
and do what is right.

35:55.556 --> 35:57.558
I'm sure the whole town's
applauding for you right now.

35:58.424 --> 36:00.466
They probably wanna buy you
a gold watch

36:00.500 --> 36:01.501
or something like that.

36:01.535 --> 36:03.804
I didn't rat you out, Brad.

36:03.837 --> 36:04.705
Neither did Jamie.

36:04.738 --> 36:07.373
It was another lawyer
in our firm.

36:07.407 --> 36:09.442
Are you telling me you had
nothing to do with this?

36:09.475 --> 36:12.212
Oh, I would love
to claim I did.

36:12.245 --> 36:14.881
I wish I had the courage
to throw away my career,

36:14.915 --> 36:17.618
but somebody else
did the dirty work for me.

36:17.651 --> 36:19.520
You're a fan of dirty work,
aren't you?

36:19.553 --> 36:20.921
I'm glad you're enjoying this.

36:20.954 --> 36:22.288
I am.

36:22.322 --> 36:24.991
But you need to remember
two things, Ellenor,

36:25.025 --> 36:27.594
first, I will walk away
from the second trial,

36:27.628 --> 36:29.429
just like I walked away
from the first.

36:29.462 --> 36:31.832
Because you make such
a favorable impression.

36:31.865 --> 36:33.366
People like you.

36:34.735 --> 36:36.737
And second,

36:36.770 --> 36:38.204
when I do walk away,

36:40.507 --> 36:42.876
I'll be looking you up.

36:43.476 --> 36:44.611
Is that a threat?

36:44.645 --> 36:47.180
Of course not.

36:47.213 --> 36:50.416
I don't believe you had nothing
to do with this, Ellenor.

36:50.450 --> 36:52.786
I am in here now,
but I won't be for long.

36:52.819 --> 36:54.555
Keep talking.

36:54.588 --> 36:56.489
I am free to repeat it all.

36:56.523 --> 37:00.026
We're in each other's lives,
Ellenor.

37:00.060 --> 37:02.435
And the story is just beginning.

37:12.812 --> 37:14.280
We've done some research,

37:14.313 --> 37:15.481
and it's not the end
of the world.

37:15.515 --> 37:16.916
Don't handle me!

37:20.120 --> 37:23.023
Even if they're not
your biological children,

37:23.056 --> 37:24.791
they are still yours.

37:24.825 --> 37:27.093
Any child born into marriage
is presumed to be--

37:27.127 --> 37:28.529
I wanna hurt her now.

37:29.963 --> 37:32.032
WILSON: Roland,
I need you to listen to me.

37:32.065 --> 37:34.467
She can't take away
your kids.

37:34.500 --> 37:36.937
Even if they
are Richard's biologically,

37:36.970 --> 37:39.205
legally, we still think
that they're yours.

37:39.239 --> 37:42.809
There are estoppel arguments
to be made against Richard,

37:42.843 --> 37:45.812
and under current
adoption laws--

37:45.846 --> 37:47.681
is he listening to me?

37:47.714 --> 37:49.215
I don't think
he's listening to me.

37:50.651 --> 37:52.819
CARLISLE: We're gonna win
this lawsuit, Roland.

37:52.853 --> 37:55.922
We're gonna try to get
you full custody.

37:55.956 --> 37:57.958
This is gonna backfire
on them.

37:57.991 --> 38:00.400
Promise me that.

38:00.433 --> 38:02.503
Please, promise.

38:02.536 --> 38:04.805
We can't promise,
Roland, but--

38:04.838 --> 38:06.372
CARLISLE: Yes, we can.

38:06.406 --> 38:08.041
I promise, Roland.

38:08.074 --> 38:09.510
I'll win this for you.

38:15.516 --> 38:18.251
WHITE: We are not persuaded
that Mr. Shore

38:18.284 --> 38:19.920
did the moral thing

38:19.953 --> 38:22.188
when he blatantly broke
privilege.

38:22.222 --> 38:24.257
We don't think
he was just at all

38:24.290 --> 38:27.160
when he betrayed his own client.

38:28.562 --> 38:30.564
Mr. Shore, in our view,

38:30.597 --> 38:32.833
you have offended
the very essence

38:32.866 --> 38:36.036
of what it means to be
a Criminal-Defense Attorney.

38:37.237 --> 38:38.839
But technically,

38:38.872 --> 38:42.843
under Rule 1.6(b)(1),

38:42.876 --> 38:44.310
a rule which you probably

38:44.344 --> 38:48.014
weren't even aware of,
were you?

38:48.048 --> 38:50.383
Absolutely.
I read it twice.

38:54.387 --> 38:56.823
Under this obscure provision,

38:56.857 --> 38:59.459
which will undoubtedly be erased

38:59.492 --> 39:02.268
now that someone
has actually invoked it,

39:03.737 --> 39:04.638
you're covered.

39:04.671 --> 39:07.708
We don't have the grounds
to suspend you,

39:07.741 --> 39:10.210
however much we might like to.

39:11.712 --> 39:13.246
We deeply hope

39:13.279 --> 39:16.482
that you will give us
another chance soon.

39:19.119 --> 39:20.521
We're adjourned.

39:20.554 --> 39:21.622
(gavel bangs)

39:22.789 --> 39:24.090
What do you know?

39:25.491 --> 39:28.194
Eugene, thank you.

39:30.664 --> 39:32.098
I did it for the firm.

39:32.132 --> 39:33.834
Don't mistake it
for affection.

39:33.867 --> 39:34.801
Yes.

39:34.835 --> 39:36.537
Thank you.

39:39.906 --> 39:43.844
(music playing)

39:54.955 --> 39:57.057
(doorbell ringing)

39:57.090 --> 39:57.891
WILSON: Roland?

39:57.924 --> 39:59.726
(knocking on door)

39:59.760 --> 40:00.701
WILSON: Roland?

40:11.344 --> 40:13.980
Roland, what's going on?

40:14.014 --> 40:14.781
Are you all right?

40:14.815 --> 40:17.317
Bedroom...

40:17.350 --> 40:19.019
I think I need a lawyer.

40:20.453 --> 40:22.055
Bedroom?

40:22.088 --> 40:24.490
(sighs) I need a lawyer.

40:27.393 --> 40:29.462
I need help.
CARLISLE: Let's go. Come on.

40:35.335 --> 40:39.272
(Joey Dee &amp; The Starliters'
"Peppermint Twist" playing)

Holy Mary, Mother of God.

40:59.626 --> 41:03.336
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done.

Lead us not into temptation...

41:10.010 --> 41:11.945
but deliver us from evil.

41:15.549 --> 41:17.784
For thine is the kingdom
and the power

41:17.818 --> 41:19.520
and the glory forever.

Amen.
