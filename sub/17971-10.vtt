I ain't afraid

You ladies want a ride
in my brand-new '84 Trans Am?

00:39.507 --> 00:42.074
Forget about those
sophomore chicks, Terry.

00:42.076 --> 00:44.176
We're graduating
<i>this</i> ear.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.277
Class of '84.

00:45.279 --> 00:50.049
Man, I can't wait for
the 1984 Olympics this year!

00:50.051 --> 00:51.150
(rock music plays)

00:51.152 --> 00:53.619
CLEVELAND:
<i>It was 1984.</i>

00:53.621 --> 00:55.721
All right, you animals,
listen up, now.

00:55.723 --> 00:58.157
Our man Cleveland Brown
is officially a legend.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.092
Not only did he win
last night's game

01:00.094 --> 01:02.628
with a home run
in the bottom of the ninth,

01:02.630 --> 01:05.531
but Coach McFall said
they're gonna retire his number

01:05.533 --> 01:06.665
after the season.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.767
To Hot Brown
Number Nine!

01:08.769 --> 01:09.701
(whooping)

01:09.703 --> 01:11.470
Yeah!
Yeah!

01:11.472 --> 01:12.871
How shot J.R.?

01:12.873 --> 01:15.040
Are y'all
drinking beer?!

01:15.042 --> 01:17.042
Hey. Wally Farker, right?

01:17.044 --> 01:18.077
You want in?

01:18.079 --> 01:19.912
It's <i>Farquhar.</i>

01:19.914 --> 01:21.980
And <i>no, </i> I do <i>n't wa</i> nt in.

01:21.982 --> 01:25.050
But in is what
I'm gonna turn you--

01:25.052 --> 01:26.151
<i>in to the principal.</i>

01:26.153 --> 01:30.089
Oh, come on, all we're doing
is letting off a little steam.

01:30.091 --> 01:31.123
Don't touch me!

01:31.125 --> 01:32.825
That's how you get AIDS.

01:32.827 --> 01:34.293
<i>Ha! What Wally doesn't know</i>

01:34.295 --> 01:37.196
<i>is that I'm wearing</i>
<i>a condom right now.</i>

01:37.198 --> 01:38.864
Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:38.866 --> 01:41.967
I'm off to report you
to the principal.

01:41.969 --> 01:42.301
Uh-uh!

01:42.303 --> 01:44.303
What you talkin' about, Wallace?

01:44.305 --> 01:46.238
Hold this.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.673

01:51.111 --> 01:52.344
Uh, ew...

01:53.347 --> 01:54.847
Hey, guys, look!

01:54.849 --> 01:56.648
He's peeing himself!

01:56.650 --> 01:57.683
(laughter)

01:57.685 --> 01:59.251
(sobbing):
Oh... no...

01:59.253 --> 02:03.789
It's all over
my thigh and pocket contents.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.190

02:10.030 --> 02:10.796

02:14.034 --> 02:15.200
Hey, you want a cold one?

02:15.202 --> 02:18.103
Does Amy Winehouse
pick at her skin a lot?

02:18.105 --> 02:22.107
Man, all this talk
about the old baseball field.

02:22.109 --> 02:23.876
Know what I say we do?

02:23.878 --> 02:25.177
Start a fight
with those old ladies

02:25.179 --> 02:28.013
in red hats and purple
dresses at the mall?

02:28.015 --> 02:29.348
No. (laughs)

02:29.350 --> 02:31.383
Come on, get serious.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.385
No, I was gonna...

Okay, seriously,

CLEVELAND:
Yee-haw!

02:40.694 --> 02:44.530
(blows landing,
martial arts grunts)

02:49.969 --> 02:51.737
Ow!

02:55.808 --> 02:58.010
Yaah!
(bone breaks)

02:58.845 --> 03:00.979
(laughter)

03:00.981 --> 03:01.880
Did you see me?

03:01.882 --> 03:04.116
I was all, "Yaah!"
(laughs)

03:04.118 --> 03:07.152
Now, if I may finish the
point I was making earlier,

03:07.154 --> 03:09.388
we should stop by
the old ball field.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.789
Oh, cool!
Maybe after that,

03:10.791 --> 03:12.758
we can drive over
and visit my daughter.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.294
I haven't seen her
for a year and a half.

03:15.296 --> 03:18.230
We'll see how we're
doing on time.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.832
Look at this place!

03:20.834 --> 03:22.935
The bleachers are
covered with racist,

03:22.937 --> 03:24.703
occasionally
hilarious graffiti.

03:24.705 --> 03:28.407
I'm surprised the team can
even play on this mess.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.342
Oh, no, there is no team.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.910
When Wally became principal,

03:31.912 --> 03:33.712
he disbanded
the baseball program.

03:33.714 --> 03:34.980
Disbanded the team?!

03:34.982 --> 03:38.350
But baseball's our slowly
dying national pastime.

03:38.352 --> 03:42.854
Oh, this is a worse travesty
than that remake of <i>Chinatown</i>

03:42.856 --> 03:44.456
with Miley Cyrus.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.058
She's my sister!

03:46.060 --> 03:47.593
(loud slap)
She's my daughter!

03:47.595 --> 03:52.030
(slap)
She's my sister
<i>and</i> y daughter!

03:54.968 --> 03:57.236
Is that
wacky tabacky?

03:57.238 --> 03:58.704
Uh... no.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.405
Oh, thank goodness.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.341
You're good kids.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.275
(laughs)

04:03.277 --> 04:05.344
But watch the height
of that five.

04:05.346 --> 04:08.847
All fives must be
shoulder-height or below.

04:09.282 --> 04:12.985
Mm. Smells like a relaxing
afternoon around here.

04:12.987 --> 04:15.120
Hey, Wally, this school
needs a baseball team.

04:15.122 --> 04:18.557
Can't afford it-- not
with the popularity
of the Math Club

04:18.559 --> 04:20.859
and the Fluffers, my
a cappella singing group.

04:20.861 --> 04:24.162
What if I could raise the money
before the season starts?

04:24.164 --> 04:28.834
Why not? I'd love to see you
raise five grand in a week.

04:28.836 --> 04:31.470
Thank you.
I meant that
sarcastically.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.472
Oh. Well, then screw you.

04:33.474 --> 04:34.906
Thank you.
What?

04:34.908 --> 04:36.041
You said screw me.

04:36.043 --> 04:39.011
I take that to mean
you're attracted to me.

04:39.013 --> 04:41.513
I'm gonna walk away now.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.248
Bye-bye.

04:44.350 --> 04:45.250
Love baseball.

04:45.252 --> 04:46.251
Love pound cake more.

04:46.253 --> 04:47.853
These cakes got
nuts in 'em?
No.

04:47.855 --> 04:50.155
Not allergic-- just don't
want nuts in my mouth.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.824
This guy gets it; this
guy'll get it later.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.893
Homophobia's no laughing matter.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.495
(chuckles):
Although, if you really think

04:56.497 --> 04:58.497
about what
they do to each other,

04:58.499 --> 04:59.498
it is kind of funny.

04:59.500 --> 05:04.469
I don't know how they're
not giggling the entire time.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.371
(register rings)

05:06.373 --> 05:10.409
We've made $422 in five days!

05:10.411 --> 05:11.843
We're on our way.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.412
Terry, how'd you do?

05:13.414 --> 05:16.381
I got us this check
for $120,000.

05:16.383 --> 05:17.516
(goofy stammering)

05:17.518 --> 05:19.084
How'd you do that?

05:19.086 --> 05:20.385
Old moneybags Waterman
gave it to me.

05:20.387 --> 05:23.822
All I had to do
was reach out and take it.

05:24.223 --> 05:26.458
Oh, Terry, I have that
donation you asked about.

05:26.460 --> 05:30.329
But I'm carrying this large
stack of books at the moment.

05:30.331 --> 05:31.797
Perhaps you could
just, um...

05:31.799 --> 05:35.400
reach into my pocket
and take the check yourself?

05:35.402 --> 05:37.469
Eh, whatever's clever.

05:39.972 --> 05:41.373
120 grand?!

05:41.375 --> 05:43.208
Hey, thanks, Mr. Waterman!

05:43.210 --> 05:44.343
You're good people.

05:44.345 --> 05:46.511
Think nothing of it, Terry.

07:20.908 --> 07:23.141
on account of we nursed
him on root beer,

07:23.143 --> 07:25.477
but he likes to dance
around like a moron

07:25.479 --> 07:27.379
and has a high
tolerance for heat.

07:27.381 --> 07:31.817
Well, I think we've got
ourselves a mascot!

07:32.185 --> 07:35.454
Cool! It smells like
beer and throw-up!

07:35.456 --> 07:37.656
Hey, Junior, where
are you headed

07:37.658 --> 07:40.058
so, quote, "fast," unquote?

07:40.060 --> 07:43.428
Inside. I got a big
day ahead of me.

07:43.430 --> 07:44.663
You sure do.

07:44.665 --> 07:45.597
Come here.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.599
Son, I'm so proud
I can officially

07:47.601 --> 07:52.938
pass on the name given to me
by Coach McFall: Hot Brown.

07:52.940 --> 07:55.307
What do you say,
Hot Brown Jr.?

07:55.309 --> 07:57.776
No, thank you--
I have no interest
in baseball.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.377
(record needle scratches,
music stops)

07:59.379 --> 08:01.413
Sorry.
His reaction surprised me.

08:01.415 --> 08:03.515
Junior, at least
give it a try.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.150
I can't, Daddy--
I'm signing up

08:05.152 --> 08:08.019
for a different after-
school activity: Math Club.

08:08.021 --> 08:09.054
(loud boinging)

08:09.056 --> 08:11.590
I'm sorry.
I sent away for this months ago.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.191
Principal Farquhar
says I have

08:13.193 --> 08:16.428
the second highest
trigonometry scores
in the whole...

08:16.430 --> 08:18.063
Eh-eh-eh-eh, back up.

08:18.065 --> 08:18.997
Math Club?

08:18.999 --> 08:20.365
Who cares about math?

08:20.367 --> 08:22.033
WALLY: I do!

08:22.035 --> 08:24.002
Right this way, Cleveland Jr.

08:24.004 --> 08:27.172
Math Club sign-ups
right this way.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.940
Attaboy.

08:28.942 --> 08:29.708
Oh, great!

08:29.710 --> 08:32.344
What else bad could happen?

08:33.012 --> 08:34.946
Oh (bleep).

08:38.551 --> 08:42.354
Hey, here's to Cleveland for
bringing baseball to town,

08:42.356 --> 08:45.257
so that all our sons,
except his, can enjoy it.

08:45.259 --> 08:50.061
Oh, what would Coach McFall say
if he knew my boy chose

08:50.063 --> 08:52.397
the Math Club
over the baseball team?

08:52.399 --> 08:56.601
McFall? Isn't that the name
of, uh, the old alkie

08:56.603 --> 09:00.138
who mops up the floor
for free drinks?

09:02.308 --> 09:05.110
(dreamlike music plays)

09:06.212 --> 09:07.612
All right, gentlemen,

09:07.614 --> 09:09.281
before you get on that field,

09:09.283 --> 09:11.483
I want you
to remember two things:

09:11.485 --> 09:14.519
one, you're all
great baseball players;

09:14.521 --> 09:19.291
two, overweight divorcees
are an easy lay.

09:19.293 --> 09:20.358
Think about it.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.227
So what do you say
we go win this thing?

09:22.229 --> 09:24.029
(players whooping and hollering)
Let's go, let's go!

09:24.031 --> 09:25.964
Let's go do it!
Let's go, brothers!
All right!

09:25.966 --> 09:27.399
McFALL:
"Sad sex" on three.

09:27.401 --> 09:28.466
One, two, three.

09:28.468 --> 09:29.568
ALL:
Sad sex!

09:29.570 --> 09:32.437
(whooping)
Let's go!
Here we go! Yeah!

09:34.807 --> 09:38.009
Coach McFall,
it's you!

09:39.211 --> 09:40.545
(suppressed retching)

09:40.547 --> 09:42.347
(swallows)

09:43.416 --> 09:45.884
So, I see you're
still a fan

09:45.886 --> 09:48.186
of the chewing
tobacco.

09:48.188 --> 09:48.653
Hot Brown!

09:48.655 --> 09:50.488
What are you doing
back in town,

09:50.490 --> 09:51.823
you bigheaded S.O.B.?

09:51.825 --> 09:55.460
Believe it or not, I'm the
Growlers' new head coach.

09:55.462 --> 09:59.264
Unfortunately, my son would
rather join the Math Club.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.199
And you're just
going to sit there,

10:01.201 --> 10:02.767
blubbering
into your beer?

10:02.769 --> 10:04.169
(spits)

10:04.171 --> 10:05.170
Well, not now.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.738
What kind of coach are you?

10:06.740 --> 10:10.342
No one's born loving baseball,
Hot Brown.

10:10.344 --> 10:11.876
How could they be?

10:11.878 --> 10:13.278
It's dull as dirt.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.446
You've got to give your son

10:14.448 --> 10:16.381
something from your past
to inspire him.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.850
Like when my dad
let me nail his third wife.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.552
He cheered me on
from the closet.

10:20.554 --> 10:21.920
Her name was Maureen.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.055
Looked like a really hot
Dick Nixon.

10:24.057 --> 10:28.460
Make baseball your hot
Dick Nixon, Cleveland.

10:29.895 --> 10:33.231
I know the perfect
thing to give Junior.

10:33.233 --> 10:36.334
Coach, I don't know
how to thank you.

10:36.336 --> 10:39.471
I need a place to live
and some money.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.373
Oh, we all do, Coach.

10:41.375 --> 10:43.508
We all do.

10:46.779 --> 10:48.179
Hey, Daddy.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.681
I was just playing
truth or dare,

10:49.683 --> 10:53.351
and I was dared to climb
the bookshelf like a fireman.

10:53.353 --> 10:54.452
Who dared you?

10:54.454 --> 10:55.553
Larry the Leopard.

10:55.555 --> 10:58.490
14... you're 14!

10:58.492 --> 10:59.457
Now, get down here.

10:59.459 --> 11:02.594
I got something
I want you to have.

11:03.729 --> 11:05.397
Wow!

11:05.399 --> 11:06.264
Number Nine?

11:06.266 --> 11:09.234
I thought when you left,
they retired it for good.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.402
I'm Brett Favre-ing it.

11:10.404 --> 11:13.638
Except I'm not being
a public jag-off about it.

11:13.640 --> 11:17.142
I want you to join the team
and wear my jersey

11:17.144 --> 11:20.712
and keep
the Brown family legacy alive.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.514
Wow!

11:23.716 --> 11:25.517
(both screaming)

11:25.519 --> 11:28.753
Larry the Leopard,
call for backup, pronto!

11:31.290 --> 11:33.892
ANGUS:
And Collegiate leading by one,

11:33.894 --> 11:37.128
thanks to a great outing
by pitcher Myles Duggan.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.064
Duggan's a junior,
but only because

11:39.066 --> 11:41.266
he was held back this year
for what he claims is

11:41.268 --> 11:45.603
a "learning disability"
called-- get this-- "dyslexia."

11:45.605 --> 11:47.539
(laughs)
Gesundheit.

11:47.541 --> 11:50.175
(dance music plays)

11:52.578 --> 11:56.581
Look, a black baseball player
that doesn't speak Spanish.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.616
Rallo, what are
you talking about?

11:58.618 --> 11:59.918
That's rare.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.720
Come on, Junior.

12:01.722 --> 12:02.554
(cheering)

12:02.556 --> 12:04.656
GORDY:
That's Cleveland Brown Jr.,

12:04.658 --> 12:07.525
wearing the original jersey
his father made famous.

12:07.527 --> 12:12.630
After 25 years, Hot Brown Number
Nine is back at the plate.

12:12.632 --> 12:14.999
Here's the pitch and...

12:15.001 --> 12:15.800
ball one.

12:15.802 --> 12:16.968
Little outside.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.536
Good eye.

12:18.904 --> 12:19.971
GORDY:
Ball two.

12:19.973 --> 12:23.708
This type of excitement is
what makes the game great.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.343
Anything can happen.

12:25.345 --> 12:29.314
The next pitch could be
a strike, a hit, an out,

12:29.316 --> 12:31.816
ball three, or
even a foul.

12:31.818 --> 12:33.318
Here we go.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.553
GORDY:
Ball three.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.355
ANGUS:
Wow, I wonder

12:37.357 --> 12:38.556
what will happen next.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.291
GORDY:
Hard to say.

12:40.293 --> 12:40.892
Here we go.

12:40.894 --> 12:43.661
The pitch and...
ball four.

12:43.663 --> 12:44.829
He walks. Slowly.

12:44.831 --> 12:48.566
ANGUS:
A respectable if underwhelming
return to the field

12:48.568 --> 12:50.368
for the legendary Number Nine.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.536
(sighs)

12:51.538 --> 12:52.470
All right.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.506
GORDY:
And here's deaf powerhouse,

12:54.508 --> 12:58.076
Oliver "I Can't Hear You"
Wilkerson.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.344
(nasally):
Come on.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.478
Show me what you got.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.180
It's showtime.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.484
ANGUS:
De plane, de plane!

13:06.486 --> 13:08.319
That ball is flying!

13:08.754 --> 13:10.855
Oh, hello, Mrs. Ladybug.

13:10.857 --> 13:11.990
Run, Junior!

13:11.992 --> 13:12.724
Run!

13:12.726 --> 13:15.727
Move your fat ass!

13:22.001 --> 13:23.868
GORDY:
Double play!

13:23.870 --> 13:26.404
What was Brown thinking?!

13:26.406 --> 13:28.673
(crowd booing)

13:31.243 --> 13:32.477
(laughs)

13:32.479 --> 13:33.778
Junior stinks!

13:33.780 --> 13:35.780
Good space work, son.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.952
GORDY:
<i>Looks like Number Nine</i>
<i>is a Hot Brown mess.</i>

13:40.954 --> 13:45.723
ANGUS:
<i>Brown Number Nine makes you</i>
<i>hate the game itself.</i>

13:45.725 --> 13:48.927
GORDY:
<i>The Growlers should</i>
<i>retire that jersey again.</i>

13:48.929 --> 13:50.328
<i>Retire it to the (bleep) can.</i>

13:50.330 --> 13:52.897
<i>ANGUS:</i>
<i>Gordy, we've talked about this.</i>

13:52.899 --> 13:54.766
<i>You can't say that on the air.</i>

13:54.768 --> 13:55.667
GORDY:
<i>So what?</i>

13:55.669 --> 13:57.068
<i>They'll just bleep it.</i>

13:57.070 --> 13:59.370
<i>Brown Number Nine</i>
<i>sucks (bleep).</i>

14:03.609 --> 14:06.311
Hey, did I tell you about the
service call I got this morning?

14:06.313 --> 14:10.715
Some Russian dude tried to hook
up his cable box to his oven.

14:10.717 --> 14:11.716
(laughs)

14:11.718 --> 14:14.485
Man, what a Number Nine.

14:14.487 --> 14:15.753
Uh, I mean dumb-ass.

14:15.755 --> 14:16.788
Oh, I get it.

14:16.790 --> 14:18.323
A Number Nine. Ha-ha.

14:18.325 --> 14:19.924
Did you come up
with that yourself?

14:19.926 --> 14:21.860
Uh, no, I heard it somewhere.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.161
Where?
Everywhere.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.662
From who?
Everybody.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.030
When?
All the time.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.765
How?
Derogatorily.

14:27.767 --> 14:28.766
That's it!

14:28.768 --> 14:30.602
My legacy has
been besmirched.

14:30.604 --> 14:32.704
And it's time I
un-besmirch it.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.606
Terry, I'm going to do something

14:34.608 --> 14:37.475
I should've done
a long time ago.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.144
(tires screech)

14:40.146 --> 14:42.113
CLEVELAND (sighs):
Oh.

14:42.115 --> 14:42.981
Oh, God.

14:42.983 --> 14:45.516
Aw, this is a gross bathroom.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.652
Oh, there's pee on the seat.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.754
I don't care, I'll squat.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.689
Oh, my legs are too tired.

14:51.691 --> 14:52.724
I'll just sit in it.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.726
I got hand sanitizer
inside the truck;

14:54.728 --> 14:57.528
I'll just wipe my butt cheeks
off with it.

14:57.530 --> 14:58.429
(sighs):
Ah.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.932
They should've called this
the "ambm."

15:00.934 --> 15:02.667
Oh, man, I got to get out there

15:02.669 --> 15:04.769
and deal with my kid
and my legacy.

15:04.771 --> 15:07.672
Oh, for Pete's sake, somebody
wrote "Brown Number Nine"

15:07.674 --> 15:10.475
on the wall in number two!

15:10.477 --> 15:11.809
Oh, this place is gross.

15:11.811 --> 15:12.777
What the hell?

15:12.779 --> 15:16.214
I am never eating hot dogs
from this place anymore.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.850
Actually, I wouldn't mind
having a hot dog.

15:18.852 --> 15:20.618
Oh, they're out of paper.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.121
I better call Terry
to bring me some.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.656
No signal?

15:24.658 --> 15:25.723
This phone sucks!

15:25.725 --> 15:27.692
What am I supposed to wipe with?

15:27.694 --> 15:31.095
Oh, please tell me
I wore old socks.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.463
Yes!

15:32.965 --> 15:34.799
Now we're gonna
do something else

15:34.801 --> 15:37.035
I should have done
a long time ago.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.604
(tires screech)

15:42.775 --> 15:44.509
(gasps)

15:46.045 --> 15:46.844
Oh, no.

15:46.846 --> 15:48.112
Where's my dad's jersey?

15:48.114 --> 15:50.748
Someone stole my dad's jersey!

15:50.750 --> 15:51.849
Not just someone.

15:51.851 --> 15:55.186
This security footage should
answer all your questions,

15:55.188 --> 15:57.188
unless your questions
are of a sexual nature,

15:57.190 --> 16:01.426
in which case you should talk
to your parents or a priest.

16:06.932 --> 16:09.367
(TV clicks)

16:27.786 --> 16:31.055
Hey, what are you watching,
<i>The Cleveland Show?</i>

16:31.057 --> 16:32.724
(hums theme song)

16:32.726 --> 16:34.325
Uh-oh.

16:39.598 --> 16:42.100
Cleveland Jr., may I enter?

16:42.102 --> 16:43.334
Yes.

16:43.336 --> 16:47.138
Son, I can't believe I would
do something so stupid

16:47.140 --> 16:50.708
as to steal this
jersey back from you.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.944
Here, it's yours.

16:52.946 --> 16:53.678
Fine.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.947
You forgive me for
stealing the jersey?

16:55.949 --> 16:56.848
Yeah.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.950
Good. 'Cause
you were awful.

16:58.952 --> 16:59.951
You know that, right?

16:59.953 --> 17:01.185
I mean,
you're my boy,

17:01.187 --> 17:05.723
(Dominican accent): but you-a
no berry good at the baseball.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.091
No, sirree.

17:07.093 --> 17:08.226
No, no, no.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.193
Awful.

17:09.195 --> 17:09.994
Bad boy.

17:09.996 --> 17:11.963
Bad baseball
player.

17:11.965 --> 17:12.997
Stinky pie.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.165
Sucka-wacka.

17:14.167 --> 17:15.233
<i>No bueno.</i>

17:15.235 --> 17:17.702
(normal voice): But as for
me stealing the jersey,

17:17.704 --> 17:20.004
that's water
under the bridge.

17:20.006 --> 17:20.872
Okay.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.340
All right, then.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.810
You're a bad
baseball player.

17:29.848 --> 17:31.149
Bye.
Bye-bye, Junior.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.984
Bye, Miss Donna.

17:33.652 --> 17:34.685
Well, that was pretty cold.

17:34.687 --> 17:37.922
Cleveland, you broke into
the school, exploded his locker,

17:37.924 --> 17:41.125
and stole back your jersey
because you were ashamed of him.

17:41.127 --> 17:42.126
And I apologized.

17:42.128 --> 17:44.128
But what about
<i>my</i> isappointment?

17:44.130 --> 17:47.231
Even Tim's son Raymond
went two for three,

17:47.233 --> 17:48.800
and he was blazed
out of his mind.

17:48.802 --> 17:51.636
When are you going to realize
that this isn't about you?

17:51.638 --> 17:55.139
This is about your son and
appreciating what he's good at.

17:55.141 --> 17:59.143
Well, listen to
Dr. Phyl-icia Rashad.

17:59.145 --> 18:03.314
I told you never to mention
that name in this house.

18:03.316 --> 18:06.984
I'm gonna kill you,
Phylicia Rashad.

18:06.986 --> 18:10.021
I'm gonna kill you.

18:10.023 --> 18:12.123
(clears throat)

18:12.858 --> 18:14.692
(school bell ringing)

18:15.694 --> 18:17.161
Hey, Mr. Farquhar.

18:17.163 --> 18:18.796
I watched the
tape you gave me.

18:18.798 --> 18:22.100
As far as I'm concerned,
you may as well use this

18:22.102 --> 18:24.135
to erase that
erroneous derivative.

18:24.137 --> 18:28.072
The upper limit should be
N cubed, not N squared.

18:28.074 --> 18:30.141
No, because the--

18:30.143 --> 18:31.542
He's right!

18:31.544 --> 18:32.944
Hooray!
Yippee!

18:32.946 --> 18:34.145
Nerds!

18:36.949 --> 18:38.316
(cheering)

18:38.318 --> 18:39.684
Stand up!

18:39.686 --> 18:40.818
MAN:
You stand up!

18:40.820 --> 18:42.019
I am standing up.

18:42.021 --> 18:42.954
I know!

18:42.956 --> 18:45.022
In your face,
dwarf-ass!

18:45.024 --> 18:46.691
That's hurtful!

18:47.693 --> 18:51.829
Coach, I did something you
always told me not to do.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.831
I took my eye
off the ball--

18:53.833 --> 18:56.801
the ball being my
relationship with my son.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.402
And now, as a
consequence,

18:58.404 --> 19:01.906
there's been a rain delay
in said relationship.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.908
We've all got problems,
Hot Brown.

19:03.910 --> 19:08.012
Last night, I slept in
a gas station bathroom.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.180
It was filthy.

19:09.182 --> 19:10.615
My feet were freezing.

19:10.617 --> 19:14.185
Thank God someone left
a pair of socks in there.

19:14.187 --> 19:18.122
Hey, you think our livers
would be a match?

19:18.124 --> 19:19.724
This is an odd place

19:19.726 --> 19:21.192
for the Math
Club to meet.

19:21.194 --> 19:22.593
Pop quiz, Junior.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.163
How do you turn a nine
into a zero?

19:25.165 --> 19:26.297
CLEVELAND:
Junior!

19:26.299 --> 19:29.200
What are you doing
here with Wally?

19:30.736 --> 19:32.870
And what is he doing
with my jersey?

19:32.872 --> 19:37.608
Showing Cleveland Jr.
a real Hot Number Nine.

19:37.610 --> 19:40.578
(laughing maniacally)

19:42.147 --> 19:43.848
That's my jersey.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.116
My dad gave it to me.

19:45.118 --> 19:47.618
But then you gave it to me.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.687
No...!

19:49.689 --> 19:51.756
(grunts)

19:52.291 --> 19:53.624
Here, Daddy.

19:53.626 --> 19:54.358
I'm sorry.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.928
You've got nothing
to apologize for.

19:56.930 --> 20:00.131
You didn't disgrace
this jersey, son.

20:00.133 --> 20:01.332
I did.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.834
I'm proud to be
your father.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.136
I love you, Dad.

20:05.138 --> 20:06.103
(clears throat)

20:06.105 --> 20:07.905
Pride is what
men feel.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.308
Love is for
the ladies.

20:13.278 --> 20:14.345
Fine, go on!

20:14.347 --> 20:17.215
Go back to your dad,
you chubby loser!

20:17.217 --> 20:17.982
(crowd gasps)

20:17.984 --> 20:20.585
Nobody calls my fat son

20:20.587 --> 20:22.720
a chubby loser.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.021
(screaming)

20:28.060 --> 20:30.628
(sobbing)

20:31.196 --> 20:33.164
(screaming)

20:33.166 --> 20:34.365
Oh, no! No!

20:34.367 --> 20:35.833
Oh, not again!

20:35.835 --> 20:37.168
(laughs)

20:37.170 --> 20:38.169
Wee-wee!

20:38.171 --> 20:39.904
(sobbing)

20:39.906 --> 20:42.139
CLEVELAND:
<i>I didn't enjoy watching</i>

20:42.141 --> 20:44.075
<i>Wally humiliate himself</i>
<i>that night.</i>

20:44.077 --> 20:47.478
<i>Actually, I did.</i>
<i>I enjoyed it immensely.</i>

20:47.480 --> 20:50.481
<i>And as for Wally,</i>
<i>well, he relearned</i>

20:50.483 --> 20:54.719
<i>the same lesson he learned</i>
<i>25 years ago:</i>

20:54.721 --> 20:56.153
<i>mess with me, and you're gonna</i>

20:56.155 --> 20:59.056
<i>pee on your thigh</i>
<i>and pocket contents.</i>

20:59.058 --> 21:02.760
<i>My name is Cleveland Brown.</i>
