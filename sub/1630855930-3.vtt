12:26.600 --> 12:29.120
Do you speak French,
little one?

12:30.040 --> 12:31.360
What is your name?

12:33.160 --> 12:34.840
Do you speak German?

12:46.480 --> 12:47.880
Lose your boss

12:48.640 --> 12:50.120
and the skirt.

13:07.640 --> 13:10.440
He's not going anywhere.
What do you want?

13:11.400 --> 13:13.400
Ten pounds. For my silence.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.280
Or I tell your boss
that I saw you in the lane,

13:17.360 --> 13:20.000
putting the dead man
in the boot of the car.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.000
In English.

13:22.080 --> 13:25.360
Do that and I'll snap your neck
like a chicken wing.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.560
Alright, don't get hasty.

13:37.840 --> 13:39.600
I'll get your money.

13:41.400 --> 13:44.360
I'll get you released,
you wait for me outside.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.480
Fuck with me, you'll hang like a dog.
