WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:02.636
RUSH: This is what
 Destiny intended

00:02.670 --> 00:05.206
from the moment it
 entered the star system.

00:05.239 --> 00:07.975
YOUNG:
 That ship is the best chance
 we have of getting home.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.143
Are we done?

00:09.177 --> 00:11.312
We'll never be done.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.181
WRAY: You shouldn't have
 left him on the planet.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.049
YOUNG:
 You think I don't know that?

00:15.083 --> 00:16.250
CHLOE:
 Everyone thinks we're safe.

00:16.283 --> 00:18.652
They think that
 they'll never find us again.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.554
Why did you take
 one of our people
 prisoner?

00:20.588 --> 00:22.090
(SNARLS)

00:22.123 --> 00:23.657
CHLOE: We're not safe,
 are we?

00:23.691 --> 00:25.693
TELFORD: They're coming!
 Who's coming?

00:25.726 --> 00:27.995
Lucian Alliance,
 they're coming
 to take Destiny.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.029
RUSH: There's only one way
 this is going to
 end if we wait.

00:29.063 --> 00:31.899
YOUNG: I'm not
 surrendering this ship.

00:31.932 --> 00:34.868
I'm pregnant.
 It's yours.

00:34.902 --> 00:37.071
YOUNG: Emily!
 I'm barely
 keeping it together,

00:37.105 --> 00:38.539
and the only thing
 that's keeping me

00:38.572 --> 00:39.707
from going out of my mind
 is you.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.909
You made
 your choice, Everett.

00:41.942 --> 00:43.444
You really should
 talk to someone.

00:43.477 --> 00:48.182
Look, I lost my baby.
 And now maybe
 she's in a better place.

00:48.216 --> 00:51.285
GLORIA: You found the keys
 to controlling
 all Destiny's systems.

00:51.319 --> 00:53.187
And you're not going
 to tell anyone?

00:53.221 --> 00:54.722
Riley is not going to
 make it, sir.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.193
Look, I'm already healing.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.695
RUSH: A transfusion
 of Chloe's blood
 could help save his life.

01:01.729 --> 01:04.063
JOHANSEN:
 And pass whatever the aliens
 did to her on to him.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.891
We've run a series
 of comparative blood tests

01:30.924 --> 01:34.328
using various pathogens
we've encountered
and isolated along the way.

01:34.362 --> 01:39.767
While Chloe's blood
 continues to show atypical
 antibiotic properties,

01:39.800 --> 01:41.869
Lieutenant Scott's
 seems to have
 gone back to normal.

01:43.771 --> 01:44.672
Sir.

01:47.975 --> 01:49.977
I'm just saying
 I think it's safe to
 let him out of isolation.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.681
That's fine.
 I'll have him released.

01:55.048 --> 01:56.116
You okay?

01:56.150 --> 01:56.950
Emily wants a divorce.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.423
I just got back,
 and I don't know.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.358
I guess I should
 have seen it coming,

02:04.392 --> 02:09.963
but is it even legal
 to sign papers
 in someone else's body?

02:09.997 --> 02:12.032
(STAMMERING)
 I wouldn't know.

02:12.065 --> 02:13.701
Well, I guess
 it doesn't matter.

02:15.869 --> 02:16.904
Thanks.

02:19.139 --> 02:22.210
Wait, uh...

02:22.243 --> 02:24.645
Maybe we should talk.
 After everything
 that's happened,

02:24.678 --> 02:28.316
we haven't
had the chance.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.718
Is there anything
 that you and I
 could possibly say

02:30.751 --> 02:31.652
that's going to
 make it any better?

02:32.686 --> 02:34.288
Maybe that's not the point.

02:34.322 --> 02:36.056
Well, then, what is?

02:59.847 --> 03:01.249
WRAY: Eli.

03:01.282 --> 03:02.250
ELI: Hey.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.152
I don't know
 if you've met Ginn,

03:05.185 --> 03:08.155
one of our guests
 from the Lucian Alliance.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.691
She's been cooperating,
 providing intel

03:10.724 --> 03:12.426
on Alliance activity
 in the Milky Way,

03:12.460 --> 03:16.330
but I think she may be
 able to help us
 on the ship as well.

03:16.364 --> 03:19.900
I spent over a year
 studying Ancient systems
 to prepare for the trip.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.270
I was particularly interested
 in some of your theories

03:22.303 --> 03:23.871
on dialing
 while inside a star.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.508
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Wow.

03:27.541 --> 03:30.378
Do you still think
 there's a chance
 you could make it work?

03:30.411 --> 03:33.046
To be honest, I wasn't
 really making much progress,

03:33.080 --> 03:35.349
so I kind of put it aside.

03:35.383 --> 03:38.151
Well, maybe with Ginn's help,
 that can change.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.423
I guess it's worth a shot.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.725
Good.
 I'll leave you to it.

03:50.063 --> 03:50.898
Have a seat.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.766
Thanks.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.739
They let you out.
 Yeah.

03:59.973 --> 04:03.043
So you're not changing.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.979
Well, T.J. says
I'm pretty much
back to normal.

04:06.013 --> 04:08.215
I guess everyone
 was a little afraid

04:08.248 --> 04:10.784
I'd poisoned you
 with my alien blood.

04:10.818 --> 04:15.088
You're not contagious.
 They're just keeping
 you here because...

04:15.122 --> 04:19.125
Because I might black out
 and sabotage the ship
 without even knowing it.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.562
You saved my life.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.263
If you were just
some alien monster,

04:23.297 --> 04:24.164
you would've left me
 to die out there

04:24.197 --> 04:26.233
and no one would
 have known any better.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.868
My skin's changing.

04:30.037 --> 04:30.938
Look.

04:34.041 --> 04:37.878
It's coarse.
 Like, it's getting hard.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.483
And it's growing.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.453
It doesn't matter.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.287
(SCOFFS)

04:47.321 --> 04:48.522
Listen. Hey.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.994
We're going to find
a way out of this,
I promise.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.547
BRODY ON RADIO:
 Colonel Young, come in.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.120
Colonel Young, this is Brody
 in the Control Interface Room.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.489
Please respond.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.995
This is Young. Go ahead.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.497
We've got a bit of
 a situation here.

05:31.365 --> 05:32.866
I'm on my way.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.304
What do we got?
 Nine alien ships.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.007
They just dropped
 out of hyperspace.
 They've got us surrounded.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.575
Looks like
 the same ones who took
 Rush and Chloe.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.210
We left them behind
in another galaxy.

05:43.243 --> 05:44.578
How the hell did
 they find us out here?

05:44.612 --> 05:46.046
(BEEPING)

05:46.079 --> 05:47.014
We're getting a message.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.851
Oh, my God.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.186
They want us
to hand over Chloe.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.322
What if all this time
 they were slowly
 changing her to one of them,

05:55.355 --> 05:57.190
and now they want her back?
 She's not one of them.

05:57.224 --> 05:58.992
YOUNG: She was
 gathering intelligence.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.261
She may not have known it
 but that's what she was doing.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.096
All the more reason
not to let them
anywhere near her.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.197
How long till we jump?

06:04.231 --> 06:05.232
Forty-four minutes.

06:05.265 --> 06:06.567
Power weapons.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.517
I don't think
 that's the response
 they were looking for.

06:23.551 --> 06:24.952
Return fire.

06:31.224 --> 06:34.194
SCOTT: Watch your heads.
All right, let's move!
This is not a drill!

06:34.227 --> 06:36.263
Sergeant, you get these people
 to designated areas.

06:36.296 --> 06:38.131
I'm gonna go
 and check observation.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.200
All right.
 Come on, come on, come on.
 Let's go, let's go. Come on!

06:40.233 --> 06:41.401
(ALL CHATTERING)

06:43.270 --> 06:44.071
What are you doing?

06:45.072 --> 06:45.906
We're under attack.

06:47.575 --> 06:50.243
I can see that.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.379
You can't take on
 this many ships.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.247
They want Destiny
 more than anything.
 They wouldn't destroy us.

06:54.281 --> 06:56.584
Well, not intentionally,
 but they'd have to
 collapse the shields

06:56.617 --> 06:58.652
in order to board us,
 and that's
 a risky proposition.

07:30.217 --> 07:31.451
(GASPS)

07:39.226 --> 07:41.294
Colonel, this is Scott.
You need to seal
the entire section

07:41.328 --> 07:42.496
around
 the observation deck.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.464
Why?

07:44.498 --> 07:45.365
Seal it now! Now!

07:52.573 --> 07:54.474
Scott! What's going on?

08:00.514 --> 08:02.616
We've got
 secondary explosions
 in the engineering area.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.652
Scott, come in!

08:04.685 --> 08:06.486
Power's overloading
 in the sublight drive.
 It's going critical.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.055
Emergency shutdown!

08:08.088 --> 08:09.422
(ALARM SOUNDING)

08:13.661 --> 08:14.695
It's too late.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.374
(PANTING)

08:29.843 --> 08:31.378
(GROANING)

08:37.284 --> 08:39.587
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

08:44.592 --> 08:47.260
The plan is to get
 the repair robot working

08:47.294 --> 08:50.163
on the large domed room
 we found when we first
 came aboard the ship.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.199
If the structural integrity
 can be restored,

08:52.232 --> 08:54.668
it can be used as a new home
 for hydroponics.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.336
WRAY: Do we know
 how long it would be

08:56.369 --> 08:58.338
before the room can hold
 atmospheric pressure?

08:58.371 --> 09:00.173
Well, we've crunched
 some numbers,
 and we think...

09:00.207 --> 09:01.709
What about
 the weapons systems?

09:01.742 --> 09:03.677
Still half
 a dozen gun batteries
 that are offline.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.512
Well, you told us
 to postpone the work

09:05.545 --> 09:06.714
until we had
 a greater understanding

09:06.747 --> 09:08.181
of the grid that
powers the system...

09:08.215 --> 09:09.783
With that many
 positions down,

09:09.817 --> 09:12.385
entire sections of this ship
 are vulnerable to attack.

09:12.419 --> 09:16.289
Wasn't Dr. Kemp
 recently injured
 working on this problem?

09:16.323 --> 09:19.693
Yeah, there was
an unexpected surge
in one of the conduits.

09:19.727 --> 09:22.195
There's also the risk
 of a much more
 catastrophic overload...

09:22.229 --> 09:24.064
Irrelevant. Fix it.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.198
We don't even know
 what's wrong with it.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.700
Weapons are a priority.

09:26.734 --> 09:29.302
A new home for
hydroponics can wait.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.638
Dismissed.

09:33.506 --> 09:35.242
(ALL CHATTERING)

09:40.313 --> 09:41.649
What was that?

09:41.682 --> 09:42.750
Don't start, Camile.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.287
That work is dangerous.
 You shut it down for a reason.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.790
We need to be able
 to defend ourselves.

09:49.823 --> 09:52.559
After everything
 that we've been through,
 that should be obvious.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.162
Yeah, you know what?
 You're right.
 We have been through a lot.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.097
You, especially.

09:58.632 --> 10:01.401
Is this you acting
 as ship's therapist now?

10:01.434 --> 10:03.470
I know you, Everett.

10:03.503 --> 10:05.673
You hold yourself responsible
 for everything,

10:05.706 --> 10:08.742
including what happened
 to T.J. and the baby.

10:08.776 --> 10:11.611
But if it's starting
 to cloud your judgment,
 I need to know.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.447
I'm fine.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.460
I brought you some food.

10:28.495 --> 10:29.830
I'm not hungry.

10:31.164 --> 10:34.401
Okay, then
how about some company?

10:38.505 --> 10:40.640
I've been working
 on some fairly
 interesting equations.

10:42.575 --> 10:44.778
I thought you may
 want to take a look.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.680
(EXHALES)

10:46.714 --> 10:47.748
You've got to
 be kidding me.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.652
I'm not the one
 keeping you in here.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.455
I tried to help you.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.824
What, with the chair?

10:58.692 --> 11:01.294
Was that even real
 or was it just for show?

11:01.328 --> 11:02.830
Of course it was real.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.736
You know,
 it's pointless trying

11:08.769 --> 11:09.737
to deny the advantages
of your situation.

11:11.604 --> 11:14.241
I mean,
 just ask Lieutenant Scott.

11:14.274 --> 11:18.678
If the chair had worked,
 well, he'd be dead right now.

11:18.712 --> 11:22.515
Do you even know
 what's really
 happening to me?

11:22.549 --> 11:26.854
Obviously you're undergoing
 quite significant
 physiological changes,

11:26.887 --> 11:28.188
most notably
 in your brain.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.861
I haven't given up hope
 of finding a solution.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.196
But in the meantime,

11:36.229 --> 11:37.765
I would've thought
 you would at least

11:37.798 --> 11:38.899
want to try and
 keep yourself occupied.

11:41.969 --> 11:45.438
My research has taken
 a very interesting turn.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.743
I may be on the verge

11:49.777 --> 11:53.580
of discovering
 the true nature
 of Destiny's mission.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.552
See, here.

11:59.586 --> 12:01.688
These numbers
 haven't been corrected for
 gravitational time dilation.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.224
Obviously it depends
 on the size of the star,

12:04.257 --> 12:06.259
but it could make
 a pretty big difference.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.428
Huh. How'd I miss that?

12:08.461 --> 12:10.864
Well, your math
 is always perfect,

12:10.898 --> 12:14.267
but sometimes
you lose sight
of the context.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.572
Like I said, I've been
 studying your work.

12:21.474 --> 12:24.744
You didn't have
 anything better to do?

12:24.778 --> 12:29.249
I like numbers and equations.
 I always have,
 ever since I was little.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.685
They don't lie.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.592
When I was a kid,
 I wanted to be a vet.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.763
Animal doctor. Uh...

12:43.797 --> 12:45.799
So, my mom
 bought me a hamster,

12:45.833 --> 12:48.501
you know,
 to teach responsibility.

12:48.535 --> 12:51.638
I left the cage door open
 and my dad stepped on him.

12:51.671 --> 12:53.273
(ELI CHUCKLES)

12:53.306 --> 12:54.407
That was the end
 of that career.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.709
Well, I'm sure
you would have made
a very good doctor.

13:01.481 --> 13:06.453
Anyway, if it wasn't
 for the, uh, hamster?

13:07.620 --> 13:11.024
It's like a small rodent.

13:11.058 --> 13:15.963
Well, if it wasn't for him,
none of us would be here.

13:15.996 --> 13:20.733
Never thought of that.
 That's really weird.

13:21.534 --> 13:22.769
(BOTH LAUGHING)

13:22.802 --> 13:23.636
ELI: I don't...

13:36.649 --> 13:37.985
(EXHALES)

13:40.587 --> 13:42.055
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

13:44.892 --> 13:47.627
BRODY ON RADIO:
 Colonel Young, come in.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.829
Colonel Young, this is Brody
 in the Control Interface Room.

13:49.863 --> 13:50.931
Please respond.

13:53.766 --> 13:56.003
This is Young.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.670
We've got a bit of
 a situation here.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.142
They want us to
 hand over Chloe.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.077
What if all this time
 they were slowly
 changing her to one of them,

14:04.111 --> 14:05.412
and now
they want her back?

14:05.445 --> 14:06.446
She's not
 one of them.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.951
Colonel.
 What should we do?

14:12.385 --> 14:13.921
Maybe we should
 power the weapons?

14:13.954 --> 14:16.523
No, that won't work.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.525
We've still got 44 minutes
 until the next jump.

14:18.558 --> 14:19.526
We have to
 do something.

14:25.732 --> 14:26.866
That was a warning shot.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.101
(BEEPING)

14:28.135 --> 14:30.003
We're getting
 another message.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.839
It says if we don't comply,
 they'll destroy us.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.675
They're bluffing.
 They want Destiny
 more than anything.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.577
What's happening?
We're surrounded
by alien ships.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.846
They want us
 to hand over Chloe.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.015
I suggest we shut down
 all non-essential systems,

14:42.049 --> 14:44.051
devote every scrap of power
to the shields.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.719
Let's do that.
 Let's do it.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.430
I don't think
 that's the response
 they were looking for.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.632
RUSH: It doesn't matter.
 The shields are holding.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.079
They don't have
 enough firepower.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.981
We're going to
 make it to the jump.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.482
We've got
 more ships incoming.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.425
I'm now reading
 15 ships total.
 They're all firing.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.762
I thought we agreed
 that they didn't
 want to destroy us!

15:29.796 --> 15:31.598
Not intentionally.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.533
They'd have to collapse
 the shields in order
 to board the ship.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.739
We have secondary explosions
 in the engineering area.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.908
BRODY: Power's overloading
 in the sublight drive.
 It's going critical.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.776
RUSH: Emergency shutdown.
 Now!

15:45.178 --> 15:46.679
BRODY: It's too late.

15:54.554 --> 15:55.855
(GASPS)

16:04.197 --> 16:05.698
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

16:15.142 --> 16:16.543
Colonel...
 Well, you wanted
 to be a shrink.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.111
Now here's your chance.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.646
What are you talking about?
What's going on?

16:19.679 --> 16:21.548
I think I might
be going insane.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.787
You've been drinking.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.557
That's not the problem.
That's just
one of the symptoms.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.793
No, what I'm saying is
 that maybe now's
 not the best time.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.828
Yeah. All right.

16:35.862 --> 16:39.032
Well, I, uh...

16:39.066 --> 16:42.535
(CLEARS THROAT)
 I've been having
 this recurring dream,

16:42.569 --> 16:45.205
only it's more than a dream.

16:45.238 --> 16:49.242
It's real. It's about
 as real as it gets.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.745
Okay. What's it about?

16:52.779 --> 16:56.916
The aliens
 from the other galaxy,
 they catch up to us.

16:56.949 --> 17:00.653
They surround the ship,
and then they ask me
to hand over Chloe.

17:00.687 --> 17:04.324
And, now, the first time,
 I try to fight them off,

17:04.357 --> 17:06.193
the ship gets destroyed.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.895
The second time,
 I go into
 a defensive shell,

17:08.928 --> 17:11.531
but the ship
 still gets destroyed.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.833
Wait a minute.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.835
Is that why you
 ordered Park and her team

17:15.867 --> 17:17.904
to resume work on
 the weapons grid?

17:17.936 --> 17:19.239
Because
 of this dream?

17:19.271 --> 17:23.175
Listen.
 There's something else
 going on here.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.845
I mean, this is like no dream
 I've ever had before.

17:25.877 --> 17:29.549
I mean, I can feel
 the floor under my feet.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.984
I can smell the sweat
 of the people
 around me, Camile.

17:33.820 --> 17:37.557
Yeah, yeah.
It's a no-win scenario.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.025
It seems like
 the only way out would be

17:39.058 --> 17:41.928
for you to do the one thing
that you don't want to do.

17:41.961 --> 17:44.164
I don't think
 it's that simple.

17:45.765 --> 17:49.302
Have you even
spoken to Chloe

17:49.336 --> 17:51.704
since you've confined
 her in her quarters?

17:51.738 --> 17:54.107
No.

17:54.141 --> 17:56.143
Well, maybe that would be
 a good place to start.

18:00.747 --> 18:01.748
Hey.

18:03.916 --> 18:08.621
Wow, another visitor. Hmm.
I've never been so popular.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.890
Well, listen, you know,
 I'm sorry that I haven't
 come to see you before.

18:10.923 --> 18:11.924
I've been busy.

18:15.995 --> 18:18.298
Also, it's hard for me.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.269
Because of what
 you might have to do.

18:27.207 --> 18:31.344
You know, I...
 I was feeling
 sorry for myself,

18:31.378 --> 18:32.812
being stuck
 in this room,

18:34.947 --> 18:38.251
but then I remembered
 how everyone looked at me

18:38.285 --> 18:40.887
when they found out
 I was still infected.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.091
I think I'm better off
 in here.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.127
Really?
 You know that the people
 on this ship care about you.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.296
They're afraid of me.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.800
I'm afraid of me.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.670
Nobody's
given up hope here.

18:57.704 --> 18:58.905
I know.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.775
But if there's no solution,

19:02.809 --> 19:05.645
if I keep changing,
 sooner or later,
 you won't have a choice.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.190
(GRUNTS)

19:17.224 --> 19:18.325
Hey. Sorry.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.230
So?

19:23.263 --> 19:24.664
So, what?

19:26.899 --> 19:28.067
When are you
 gonna make a move?

19:31.003 --> 19:32.138
What are you talking about?

19:32.171 --> 19:35.408
Ginn.
 The girl's into you.

19:35.442 --> 19:38.811
And you know this from
 watching us work together
 for, what, two days?

19:38.845 --> 19:41.047
I knew after 10 minutes.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.315
The girl loves math, Eli.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.683
(GROANS)

19:46.185 --> 19:48.020
And if ever you
 were gonna have

19:48.054 --> 19:49.256
a chance with anyone,
 this is probably it.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.523
Thanks.

19:54.394 --> 19:56.996
Tell you what.

19:57.029 --> 20:00.800
The next time we're together,
 I'll arrange
 to get called away.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.240
Okay. But don't
make it too obvious.

20:07.274 --> 20:09.709
Obvious is good.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.078
(SCOFFS)

20:16.383 --> 20:17.884
Time to man up.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.736
BRODY ON RADIO:
 Colonel Young, come in.

20:38.305 --> 20:40.206
Colonel Young, this is Brody
 in the Control Interface Room.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.841
Please respond.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.416
What's happening?

20:49.449 --> 20:50.883
ELI: We're surrounded
 by alien ships.

20:50.917 --> 20:54.554
They want us to
 hand over Chloe.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.956
I suggest shutting down
 all non-essential systems,

20:56.989 --> 20:59.392
devote every scrap of power
 to the shields.

20:59.426 --> 21:02.462
No, that's not
 going to work.
 More ships are coming.

21:02.495 --> 21:03.796
Well, how could you
 possibly know that?

21:03.830 --> 21:06.833
If we power the weapons
or the shields
or provoke them in any way,

21:06.866 --> 21:08.868
they will open fire
 and destroy all of us.

21:11.471 --> 21:12.939
So, what do we do?

21:16.843 --> 21:18.010
I guess it's time.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.492
Colonel, this is Brody.
 You were right.

21:32.525 --> 21:35.328
Another half-dozen ships
 just dropped
 out of hyperspace.

21:35.362 --> 21:36.463
Are they sending
 over a shuttle?

21:36.496 --> 21:37.497
It's on its way.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.502
Dial back
 the shield strength
 over the hull breach.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.141
What did you do?

22:22.174 --> 22:23.342
I didn't have a choice.

22:23.376 --> 22:25.177
You son of a bitch!

22:25.211 --> 22:26.178
Lieutenant, no!

22:27.046 --> 22:28.214
No!

22:31.283 --> 22:32.318
BRODY:
 Colonel, we've got a problem.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.053
More alien shuttles
 are approaching.

22:34.086 --> 22:35.321
A lot more.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.123
(LAUGHING)

22:41.260 --> 22:43.563
Colonel Young,
 are you reading me? Colonel?

22:43.596 --> 22:46.098
This is Scott.
 What's happening?

22:46.132 --> 22:48.401
This is Rush. Power's down
 all over the ship,
 including shields.

22:48.435 --> 22:50.937
We can't restore them.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.439
Chloe must have discovered
 how and passed along
 the information.

22:52.472 --> 22:55.241
Get down to the armory,
 break out every weapon
 we've got.

22:55.274 --> 22:57.376
Organize defense teams.
 We're about to be boarded.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.479
Yes, sir.

23:05.952 --> 23:10.356
(GUNS FIRING IN DISTANCE)

23:10.389 --> 23:12.024
SCOTT ON RADIO: We've got
 another hull breach
 near the infirmary!

23:12.058 --> 23:14.126
Fall back to my position!

23:14.160 --> 23:16.395
This is Rush.
 We have to defend
 the Gate Room at all costs!

23:16.429 --> 23:18.330
PARK ON RADIO:
 There's too many!
 We can't hold them!

23:42.955 --> 23:45.291
JOHANSEN: Colonel?

23:45.324 --> 23:47.426
Hey. Hey, what are
 you doing here?

23:49.095 --> 23:51.063
Picking up a batch
 Brody made for me.

23:51.097 --> 23:52.532
Extra strong.
 I use it
 for disinfectant.

23:56.368 --> 23:58.070
You don't look so good.

23:58.104 --> 24:01.007
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, I know.
 I guess
 it's that obvious, huh?

24:04.477 --> 24:09.281
Everett, what if
I told you that the baby,
our baby, is still alive?

24:12.118 --> 24:13.419
I mean, I don't know.
 Why would...
 Why would you do that?

24:13.452 --> 24:16.122
Because I saw her.

24:16.155 --> 24:18.324
Because I held her
 in my arms
 and she's beautiful...

24:18.357 --> 24:19.692
T.J.

24:19.726 --> 24:21.460
It's like nothing
 you can imagine.

24:21.494 --> 24:23.996
We were on the planet
 where we left Caine
 and the others,

24:24.030 --> 24:25.532
and the aliens there,
 they said that
 they would take care of her.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.967
Caine promised me.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.101
Then they sent me
 back here.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.202
You never
 left the ship.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.171
I know...

24:32.204 --> 24:34.440
Look, I know.
 I know what it sounds like

24:34.473 --> 24:36.342
and that's why
 I didn't say
 anything before,

24:36.375 --> 24:38.778
because I knew
 that you would think
 I was crazy.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.648
But I'm not.
I'm not crazy,

24:43.382 --> 24:45.552
and it wasn't a dream.

24:45.585 --> 24:47.286
Why is it so hard to believe
 after everything
 that we've seen

24:47.319 --> 24:48.320
since we've been here...

24:48.354 --> 24:49.155
Hey, listen to me!

24:50.723 --> 24:52.792
Just because you want
 something to be true

24:52.825 --> 24:55.061
it doesn't mean it is, T.J.
 Okay?

24:56.495 --> 24:59.498
Okay. You listen to me.

25:01.433 --> 25:05.137
I can see
 where you're going.

25:05.171 --> 25:07.039
I know, because
 I almost went there.

25:08.741 --> 25:10.677
I'm afraid that
 you won't come back.

25:13.680 --> 25:14.747
I'm sorry.

25:23.255 --> 25:24.557
That's weird.

25:25.457 --> 25:26.693
What?

25:26.726 --> 25:28.327
The computer's using
 a ton of memory

25:28.360 --> 25:31.163
running a program
 I've never even seen before.

25:31.197 --> 25:34.033
Maybe some kind
 of auto-diagnostic?
 I don't...

25:34.066 --> 25:36.435
I have to ask.
What are all
these pictures?

25:37.770 --> 25:39.772
Oh, those are stills
 from my movie.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.308
My documentary.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.579
I've been trying to keep
 a record of everything

25:46.613 --> 25:49.448
that's been happening to us,
 using the Kino.

25:49.481 --> 25:50.583
Here.

25:55.254 --> 25:56.355
Oh, see?

25:56.388 --> 25:58.057
BRODY ON MONITOR:
 Nobody wants to see this.

25:58.090 --> 26:00.660
ELI: No, no,
 it's the little things
 that make all the difference.

26:01.594 --> 26:02.795
BRODY: Fine.

26:02.829 --> 26:05.765
Ancient toilets.
 Here we go.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.068
(BOTH LAUGHING)

26:10.102 --> 26:11.604
Anyway, you get the idea.

26:11.638 --> 26:13.606
JAMES ON RADIO:
 Sergeant Greer, come in.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.708
Go ahead.

26:15.742 --> 26:18.577
There's a problem in the mess.
 We need your assistance.

26:20.146 --> 26:22.114
On my way.

26:22.148 --> 26:23.215
You're leaving?

26:23.249 --> 26:24.150
Could take a while.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.592
One second?

26:46.338 --> 26:50.176
Whoa, whoa. Uh,
 I'm not so sure about this.

26:50.209 --> 26:51.410
You'll thank me later.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.578
But what am I
 supposed to say?

26:52.611 --> 26:54.446
The girl's from
another planet.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.787
I guess I'm supposed
 to tell you
 to be yourself,

27:00.820 --> 27:03.189
but in your case...

27:04.623 --> 27:09.195
ELI: So my mom just left.

27:09.228 --> 27:13.800
It was good to see her
 even though
 she was in Park's body.

27:15.835 --> 27:17.303
Little weird.

27:19.205 --> 27:20.306
Anyway...

27:22.474 --> 27:23.710
I think it helped.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.315
At least I hope so.

27:29.348 --> 27:30.349
Okay, I got this.

27:30.382 --> 27:31.483
You got this?

27:32.484 --> 27:33.619
How long
are you gonna be?

27:33.652 --> 27:35.321
How long you gonna need?

27:36.989 --> 27:39.191
I'll take my time.

27:39.225 --> 27:39.826
(LAUGHING)

27:43.896 --> 27:46.766
It's hard. You know?

27:48.901 --> 27:53.472
I mean, I know that
 we're several billion
 light years apart

27:53.505 --> 27:55.842
and, well,
 that may never change...

28:00.612 --> 28:04.717
But I... I just need to know
 that she's still there.

28:07.954 --> 28:11.557
You know...
 'Cause if she's not...

28:11.590 --> 28:13.592
Then I don't have...

28:13.625 --> 28:17.764
Sorry. I didn't know
that it was going to be
anything that personal.

28:17.797 --> 28:20.199
No, no, that's...
That's not your fault.

28:21.801 --> 28:23.502
Real smooth, though, huh?

28:23.535 --> 28:26.005
A grown man
 crying about his mom?

28:26.038 --> 28:27.539
(EXHALING) Suave.

28:29.541 --> 28:32.411
(SIGHING) I might as well
 just get Greer to come back.

28:32.444 --> 28:33.612
What do you mean?

28:35.547 --> 28:36.715
Never mind.

28:54.466 --> 28:55.802
(DISTORTED ECHOING)

29:07.513 --> 29:08.614
Colonel?

29:12.284 --> 29:13.419
Colonel, are you in there?

29:17.756 --> 29:19.591
Yeah. What do you need?

29:22.428 --> 29:27.299
Uh, the ship, it dropped out,
 but there's no gates in range.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.401
Brody says
 we're just drifting.

29:29.435 --> 29:32.438
Well, that doesn't
 sound so bad.

29:32.471 --> 29:33.906
Except there's
no countdown clock.

29:33.940 --> 29:34.773
We have no idea how long
 it's going to last.

29:35.707 --> 29:36.943
You figure it out.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.511
Sir?

29:45.517 --> 29:48.420
FRANKLIN: Problems?

29:48.454 --> 29:51.423
Well, the ship doesn't drop
 out of FTL for no reason.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.759
Unless you tell it to.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.761
Yeah, well, this time,
 it wasn't me,

29:55.794 --> 29:58.330
and I can't find
 anything wrong with
 navigation or propulsion.

29:58.364 --> 30:00.032
Maybe you need to
 look somewhere else.

30:05.371 --> 30:07.039
As far as I can tell,
 there's nothing interfering

30:07.073 --> 30:09.541
with the normal operation
 of the FTL drive.

30:09.575 --> 30:10.943
The ship just doesn't
 want to go anywhere.

30:10.977 --> 30:12.111
What about a dial-in?

30:12.144 --> 30:13.579
Gate's quiet.

30:15.681 --> 30:17.449
WRAY: Where's Young?

30:17.483 --> 30:18.684
He's not feeling well.

30:20.486 --> 30:21.787
All right, what's new?

30:21.820 --> 30:22.588
So far,
 we've got nothing.

30:23.589 --> 30:24.723
What about you?

30:26.358 --> 30:28.660
Eli?

30:28.694 --> 30:32.498
Well, I've been working
 with that Lucian Alliance
 girl, Ginn?

30:32.531 --> 30:35.968
Actually, it's gone
 a little bit beyond
 just working together.

30:36.002 --> 30:37.336
I don't want to
 jinx it, but she's...

30:37.369 --> 30:38.437
Eli.

30:43.009 --> 30:45.011
Anyway, we've been
 running a series of programs

30:45.044 --> 30:46.712
that were designed
 for modeling.

30:46.745 --> 30:50.649
You know, simulation.
 It was really sluggish.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.151
And I couldn't
 figure out why.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.653
And then I realized
 that the computer

30:54.686 --> 30:55.922
was running
 a simulation of its own.

30:57.423 --> 30:59.425
What kind of simulation?

30:59.458 --> 31:02.494
I just figured that out now.
 It's a battle scenario.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.096
The Destiny
 drops out of FTL,

31:04.130 --> 31:06.999
and then it's
 immediately surrounded
 by alien ships.

31:07.033 --> 31:10.669
It's run through
 several different variations,
 different scenarios,

31:10.702 --> 31:12.738
but it always ends badly.

31:13.472 --> 31:16.042
Oh, my God.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.410
Are you talking about
 the aliens
 from the other galaxy,

31:18.444 --> 31:20.712
the ones that
 took Chloe and Rush?

31:21.880 --> 31:23.482
Yeah, same guys.

31:24.917 --> 31:25.884
Camile, what is it?

31:29.888 --> 31:31.423
A battle simulation.

31:31.457 --> 31:33.125
FRANKLIN: Exactly.

31:33.159 --> 31:35.894
Extremely complex,
 modeled down
 to the last detail,

31:35.928 --> 31:38.931
and always with
 an unfortunate result.

31:38.965 --> 31:42.868
Well, it's interesting,
 but what's it got to do
 with the ship dropping out?

31:42.901 --> 31:43.802
Look closer.

31:56.848 --> 31:59.885
Something about this program
 is overriding
 normal operations.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.620
Which leaves
 only one question.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.624
Why?

32:06.925 --> 32:08.894
Okay, so you're
 telling me the ship

32:08.927 --> 32:10.562
is affecting
 the Colonel's dreams?

32:10.596 --> 32:12.931
It's the only explanation.

32:12.965 --> 32:15.767
It's not impossible.
 Brain waves are just
 electrical impulses,

32:15.801 --> 32:20.439
so theoretically,
 they could be manipulated,
 if you knew how.

32:20.472 --> 32:23.442
Maybe it's Destiny's way
 of warning us.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.011
What if it knows
 the aliens are coming?

32:25.044 --> 32:27.146
No, there's no way
 they could have followed us.

32:30.182 --> 32:33.585
No, I told you already.
 I don't remember anything
 about the blackouts.

32:33.619 --> 32:36.755
Look,
I need you to think, Chloe.
This is very important.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.190
(SIGHS)

32:38.224 --> 32:40.959
When James was
 under the influence
 of those aliens,

32:40.993 --> 32:44.130
she managed to send them
 some kind of a signal.

32:44.163 --> 32:45.797
Is it possible
 you could have
 done the same thing?

32:50.736 --> 32:52.571
I don't remember.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.476
Eli, this is Scott.
 Prep the weapons.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.178
Bypass any batteries
 that aren't 100%,

32:59.211 --> 33:00.979
devote the remaining power
 to the rest.

33:01.013 --> 33:02.781
Shut down all
 non-essential systems

33:02.814 --> 33:04.883
and put everything you can
 into the shields.

33:04.916 --> 33:06.718
ELI ON RADIO: Understood.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.657
Going on patrol
 in teams of three.

33:11.690 --> 33:13.959
Lieutenant James, here,
 has your assignments.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.294
Now, if they do come,

33:15.327 --> 33:18.497
it is a pretty safe bet
they are going to try
and board this ship.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.799
Makes us the last
 line of defense.
 Any questions?

33:20.832 --> 33:23.302
All right. Dismissed.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.571
MAN: Okay, let's go.

33:25.604 --> 33:28.507
Camile, I need you to
organize the civilians.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.676
I want everyone
 in designated areas
 till further notice.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.244
There's something else
 we need to talk about.

33:32.278 --> 33:33.712
Can it wait?
 No.

33:41.053 --> 33:42.654
I know what
 you're going to say.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.590
Where is he?
 I can handle this.

33:44.623 --> 33:48.994
Well, that's the point.
 You can. Evidently he can't.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.597
You have to assume
 command officially.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.199
I can't do that.

33:53.232 --> 33:54.566
Well, what if
 this is a test?

33:54.600 --> 33:56.902
These dreams
 the Colonel's been having.

33:56.935 --> 33:58.204
A test of his
 emotional stability.

33:58.237 --> 34:00.272
A test he's failing.

34:00.306 --> 34:02.341
Where is this
 coming from?

34:02.374 --> 34:05.277
Think about it.
 What is the Colonel
 doing right now?

34:05.311 --> 34:07.346
He's locked himself away.
 He's shut down.

34:07.379 --> 34:10.181
And at the exact same time,
 the ship came to a dead stop,

34:10.216 --> 34:12.851
and now we're floating
 aimlessly in empty space.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.719
Destiny is beginning
 to understand us.

34:15.887 --> 34:19.891
Who we are,
 what makes us tick.

34:19.925 --> 34:22.628
What, you're telling me
 the ship wants me
 to replace him?

34:22.661 --> 34:24.362
RUSH: No, no.

34:24.396 --> 34:29.301
It's not as if it has
 desires or emotions.

34:29.335 --> 34:31.036
It has no personality.

34:31.069 --> 34:34.273
But it is capable of analyzing
 all manner of sensory input.

34:34.306 --> 34:36.608
It knows we're here.

34:36.641 --> 34:39.378
It's beginning to understand
 what effect
 we might be having.

34:39.411 --> 34:42.714
Why not one of you?

34:42.748 --> 34:46.252
Well, we've been
 down that road before.
 None too successful.

34:46.284 --> 34:49.288
(EXHALING) I thought
 this was about aliens.

34:49.321 --> 34:52.257
I thought this was a warning
 to prepare us for an attack.

34:52.291 --> 34:54.826
Either way,
 a warning, a test,

34:54.860 --> 34:58.096
we need a strong leader
right now.

34:58.130 --> 35:00.832
I don't like it
 anymore than you do,

35:00.866 --> 35:02.668
but I don't think
you have a choice.

35:08.174 --> 35:09.208
Colonel?

35:15.281 --> 35:17.783
Colonel, I'm not going away
 till you open this door!

35:21.953 --> 35:23.689
I brought you some tea.

35:23.722 --> 35:26.958
It's really strong stuff,
 closest thing
 to coffee we had.

35:26.992 --> 35:29.928
Oh, thanks, Lieutenant.
I'll pass on the tea.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.830
Sir, we have
 a situation here.

35:31.863 --> 35:34.032
You need to
clean yourself up
and get back out there.

35:36.368 --> 35:38.304
What are you doing?
Are you giving me an order,
Lieutenant?

35:38.337 --> 35:41.072
Sir, these dreams
 you're having.
 The battle scenario.

35:41.907 --> 35:44.176
It's the ship.

35:44.210 --> 35:46.778
It's affecting
 your brain waves.
 It's a simulation.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.180
It's a simulation?
 What does that even mean?

35:48.214 --> 35:49.281
Eli found the program.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.717
It is the exact same thing
 you described to Camile.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.285
It can't be a coincidence.

35:53.319 --> 35:55.854
Boy, I guess the ship has
 some sense of humor. Yeah.

35:58.156 --> 36:01.793
She thinks your reaction,
 the fact that you've...

36:01.827 --> 36:04.463
Well, you've given up,
 it's the reason why
 we have dropped out,

36:04.496 --> 36:06.698
why we are stuck out here
 in the middle of nowhere.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.800
Now, if you pull
 yourself together,

36:08.834 --> 36:10.902
you start acting
 like a real commander,
 maybe we can get going again.

36:10.936 --> 36:13.672
Or maybe
 that's just Destiny's way
 of telling me

36:13.705 --> 36:15.241
that I need to be replaced.

36:15.274 --> 36:16.975
That's what Rush said.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.810
(CHUCKLING) Is that
 what Rush said?

36:18.844 --> 36:19.845
But I'm not
 going to do that.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.349
Are you in love
with Chloe?

36:24.850 --> 36:26.685
It's a simple question.
Do you love her?

36:27.753 --> 36:30.222
Yes.
 Yes.

36:30.256 --> 36:31.757
So how are you going to feel
 when I have to
 drop her off this ship,

36:31.790 --> 36:33.492
put her on some rock,
 and you know it's coming.

36:33.525 --> 36:36.428
She knows it's coming,
 we all know it's coming,

36:36.462 --> 36:38.897
but I got to do it.

36:38.930 --> 36:40.165
You still going to
look up to me then.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.934
You still
 going to think, "Hey!"

36:42.968 --> 36:44.736
Tell everyone
 what a great commander I am?

36:44.770 --> 36:46.372
Are you, Lieutenant?

36:46.405 --> 36:48.507
Don't... Don't do this.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.909
I'm sorry
 that you didn't have
 a father growing up,

36:50.942 --> 36:52.378
but I didn't
 volunteer for that either.

36:54.212 --> 36:59.050
There you go.
 Now we're talking.
 Hit me. Hit me!

36:59.084 --> 37:03.422
No one asked for this,
 but you are
 the commanding officer.

37:03.455 --> 37:05.357
You don't get to
 feel sorry for yourself.

37:05.391 --> 37:07.092
And if you don't like it,
 too bad.

37:09.094 --> 37:10.896
I killed Riley.

37:12.298 --> 37:13.399
That wasn't your fault.

37:13.432 --> 37:15.801
I know
it wasn't my fault.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.469
No, he knew it. That's...

37:17.503 --> 37:21.407
He didn't want to die alone.
 That's why he asked me.

37:21.440 --> 37:24.810
But I killed him.
 I suffocated him
 with my own hands.

37:29.515 --> 37:31.417
On top of
 everything else,
 it's just...

37:33.519 --> 37:35.854
You know, it adds up.

37:41.126 --> 37:42.461
I need you to leave.

37:46.498 --> 37:49.968
Look, you're right.

37:50.001 --> 37:53.405
I couldn't do it,
 live with the burden
 every day.

37:53.439 --> 37:57.309
That is not me or T.J.,
or Camile.

37:57.343 --> 37:59.010
Rush could do it.

37:59.044 --> 38:00.812
For Rush,
 it wouldn't be a burden.

38:00.846 --> 38:03.248
That is why we need you,

38:03.281 --> 38:05.817
because you feel it.

38:05.851 --> 38:07.453
But not so much
 you can't get up and do it
 all over again the next day.

38:07.486 --> 38:10.456
Really? You sure?
 You sure about that,
 Lieutenant?

38:10.489 --> 38:13.525
A real leader,
 a good commander,

38:15.461 --> 38:18.497
is not so callous
 that he stops caring,

38:18.530 --> 38:22.167
just enough
 so he can keep on going.

38:22.200 --> 38:25.337
And we both know
 you are a good commander.

38:31.843 --> 38:33.311
It is never going
 to stop hurting.

38:35.013 --> 38:37.215
That's the whole point.

38:37.248 --> 38:39.851
For the sake
 of everyone
 on this ship

38:39.885 --> 38:41.186
you are going to
 have to live with it.

39:14.886 --> 39:17.055
But we've got five down
 by the mess.
 So if we take...

39:20.091 --> 39:21.893
Mr. Brody,
 what's our status?

39:24.095 --> 39:27.032
Well, uh,
 still no sign
 of the aliens.

39:27.065 --> 39:29.000
The ship's main weapon
 is online,

39:29.034 --> 39:31.670
and we've diverted
 as much power as we can
 to the shields.

39:31.703 --> 39:36.107
Sir, we have all
 available military personnel
 patrolling the gaps

39:36.141 --> 39:38.410
between the active weapons
 batteries, but it's
 a lot of real estate.

39:38.444 --> 39:41.179
We could go to two-man teams,
 cover a little more ground,

39:41.212 --> 39:43.915
but we'd be
 stretching ourselves
 pretty thin.

39:43.949 --> 39:47.519
Well, let's do it.
 If there is a breach,
 I would rather be on it fast

39:47.553 --> 39:50.021
with a little less firepower
 than the other way around.

39:50.055 --> 39:53.291
Also, let's break out whatever
 spare ordinance we have
 from the Lucian Alliance

39:53.324 --> 39:55.360
and arm as many
civilians as possible.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.628
Well, they don't
have a lot of training.

39:56.662 --> 39:58.029
I'll command them myself.

39:58.063 --> 39:59.465
We'll stick to
 defensive positions

39:59.498 --> 40:01.066
between here
 and the Gate Room.

40:01.099 --> 40:02.367
They'll be fine.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.401
Yes, sir.

40:05.471 --> 40:06.572
Anything else?

40:16.014 --> 40:19.284
We just jumped.
 We're back in FTL.

40:21.487 --> 40:22.654
It's good to
have you back, sir.

40:31.663 --> 40:34.232
Hey, I'm happy
 as the next guy
 that we're back on track.

40:34.265 --> 40:36.001
I'm just saying that I'm not
 so comfortable knowing

40:36.034 --> 40:39.104
that Destiny can get
in our heads like that.

40:39.137 --> 40:41.239
I don't want to
 start second-guessing
 my own dreams.

40:41.272 --> 40:43.609
Well, what have you
 been dreaming about?

40:45.677 --> 40:47.579
That's not the point.

40:47.613 --> 40:49.080
At least now we
 know once and for all

40:49.114 --> 40:50.682
that we got
 the right man in command.

40:53.719 --> 40:55.521
I mean, you were there.
Tell them.

40:57.989 --> 41:02.528
Young showed up,
 started giving orders,
 and the ship just went.

41:02.561 --> 41:04.295
If someone has
 a better explanation,
 I'd like to hear it.

41:11.036 --> 41:12.437
FRANKLIN:
 Congratulations.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.640
Don't feel much
 like talking right now.

41:14.673 --> 41:18.644
You managed to
bypass the simulation
and get the ship going.

41:18.677 --> 41:23.281
Well, what choice did I have?
 Lieutenant Scott
 wasn't going to step up.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.983
I couldn't leave us
 just sitting there.

41:25.016 --> 41:27.452
But you haven't
solved the problem,

41:27.485 --> 41:28.687
and yet you're
pressing ahead.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.321
Isn't that
a little dangerous?

41:32.524 --> 41:35.794
Destiny was evaluating
 Colonel Young's ability
 to command the crew.

41:35.827 --> 41:38.564
But ultimately,
 I control the ship.

41:39.665 --> 41:41.166
And the aliens?

41:41.199 --> 41:43.735
They were never a threat.

41:43.769 --> 41:48.173
If Chloe had managed
 to send a signal
 telling them our position,

41:48.206 --> 41:49.675
it would have logged
 on that screen right there.

41:51.376 --> 41:52.243
Maybe...

41:54.546 --> 41:56.682
But just because
 one threat is behind you,

41:58.784 --> 42:00.185
doesn't mean
 there isn't another ahead.

43:27.873 --> 43:28.606
