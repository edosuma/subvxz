WEBVTT

00:03.294 --> 00:04.421
You!

00:04.504 --> 00:05.422
Kelly, I'm sorry.

00:05.505 --> 00:06.423
{\an3}I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

00:06.506 --> 00:08.132
I didn't mean to
get you all wet.

00:08.216 --> 00:10.301
{\an1}You were supposed
to be washing a car, not me.

00:10.385 --> 00:11.386
I was holding the hose.

00:11.469 --> 00:13.096
I lost my grip.
I'm only a man.

00:13.179 --> 00:14.222
{\an3}You're only a man who
likes to see girls

00:14.305 --> 00:16.265
{\an3}in wet T-shirts,
aren't you?

00:16.349 --> 00:17.308
{\an1}No, I only like to see
you in wet T-shirts.

00:17.392 --> 00:19.102
But if you feel like
you want to change,

00:19.185 --> 00:22.105
{\an3}I have a whole bunch of
dry shirts upstairs.

00:22.188 --> 00:23.273
{\an1}Thanks.

00:23.356 --> 00:24.399
You're welcome.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.025
{\an1}Stay here.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.321
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

00:36.327 --> 00:38.580
(sniffing)

00:43.334 --> 00:44.335
Valerie?

00:47.046 --> 00:48.673
Uh, yeah?

00:48.757 --> 00:49.299
Can I come in?

00:49.382 --> 00:52.427
Uh... sure.

00:55.346 --> 00:57.015
How you doing?

00:57.098 --> 00:57.807
Pretty good.

00:57.891 --> 01:01.227
{\an3}I thought I smelled
pot in here.

01:01.311 --> 01:02.437
Pot?

01:02.520 --> 01:04.188
Uh, no. I was just, uh,

01:04.272 --> 01:06.191
burning some incense.

01:06.274 --> 01:07.233
Incense?

01:07.317 --> 01:08.651
Yeah, I know

01:08.735 --> 01:11.112
it's very "boomer" of me,
but when I was 13,

01:11.196 --> 01:13.656
my mother went Buddhist
for about two minutes.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.950
She swears it helps
mellow your moods,

01:16.034 --> 01:17.202
and you know what?

01:17.285 --> 01:18.745
I think it does.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.510
{\an1}Hungry?

01:33.593 --> 01:35.303
{\an3}I don't know what's wrong
with me,

01:35.386 --> 01:37.180
{\an3}but I've got the munchies
in a major way.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.516
Well, so will Valerie
in a couple minutes.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.518
What do you mean?

01:41.601 --> 01:43.353
Isn't that usually what happens
after you smoke pot?

01:43.436 --> 01:45.688
Valerie?

01:45.772 --> 01:46.856
{\an3}Smoking pot?
(chuckles)

01:46.940 --> 01:47.857
Unmistakably,

01:47.941 --> 01:49.025
undeniably,

01:49.108 --> 01:50.193
pungently, pot.

01:50.276 --> 01:51.444
You sure it wasn't incense?

01:51.528 --> 01:52.654
{\an1}Yeah.

01:52.737 --> 01:55.365
Sandalwood incense
and California grass.

01:55.448 --> 01:56.699
Face it, Brandon.

01:56.783 --> 01:57.826
Valerie's a pothead.

{\an5}DAVID:
I can't believe you guys
haven't done this before.

03:53.566 --> 03:54.692
This is great.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.152
DONNA:
Well, Clare mixed all the music

03:56.235 --> 03:57.236
and did the editing.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.489
{\an5}CLARE:
And Donna did all
the camerawork, so...

03:59.572 --> 04:01.616
(turns stereo off)

04:01.699 --> 04:03.952
{\an1}Well, as far as I'm concerned,
you two are flying.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.662
You know, I was thinking

04:05.745 --> 04:08.331
that maybe we could collaborate

04:08.414 --> 04:09.332
on this project
I've been developing.

04:09.415 --> 04:10.333
Sure. What is it?

04:10.416 --> 04:13.002
Well, it's kind of in
the conceptual stage.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.504
Well, what's the concept?

04:14.587 --> 04:17.757
The Search for Intelligent
Bimbos on Campus.

04:17.839 --> 04:19.509
{\an1}David!
That is so sexist!

04:19.591 --> 04:22.345
{\an3}It is not.
How can you even think

04:22.428 --> 04:22.679
{\an1}of producing something
like that?

04:22.762 --> 04:23.471
We'll do it.

04:23.554 --> 04:24.472
{\an1}We will?

04:24.555 --> 04:27.141
Yeah. If he's
doing bimbos,

04:27.225 --> 04:28.309
we'll do himbos.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.310
{\an1}Himbos?

04:29.394 --> 04:31.020
Yeah, bimbos, himbos.

04:31.104 --> 04:31.729
{\an3}It'll be hysterical.
Come on.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.357
DAVID:
Absolutely. Be brutal.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.483
That's exactly what we need

04:35.566 --> 04:36.442
to take the sexist edge
off my piece.

04:36.526 --> 04:39.696
I thought you said
it wasn't sexist.

04:39.779 --> 04:40.863
Well, I lied.

04:40.947 --> 04:41.864
(knock on door)

04:41.948 --> 04:43.700
{\an1}DAVID:
Come in.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.284
Hi, Griffin.

04:45.368 --> 04:46.369
Sorry I'm late.

04:46.452 --> 04:49.372
That's okay.
We were just finishing up.

04:49.455 --> 04:52.166
{\an1}So, what're you guys
working on?

04:52.250 --> 04:55.044
I think we'll let Donna
fill you in on that one.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.921
I promise
it won't hurt a bit.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.381
That's what you said

04:58.464 --> 05:00.591
{\an1}when you asked me
to take a nap in the bushes.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.885
So, that was you in the video?

05:02.969 --> 05:06.389
{\an1}I thought you said
no one would recognize me.

05:06.472 --> 05:07.557
Yeah, well, never trust a girl
with a camera.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.142
I'll remember that.

05:09.225 --> 05:09.559
{\an3}We'll catch
you guys later.

05:09.642 --> 05:10.560
(chuckles)

05:10.643 --> 05:12.437
{\an3}CLARE:
Bye.

05:14.522 --> 05:17.900
Well, Donna seems pretty happy
with Griffin.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.403
{\an1}It's kind of weird
to see her so happy.

05:20.486 --> 05:23.531
{\an1}I mean, not...
not that I'm unhappy.

05:23.614 --> 05:26.242
{\an1}Not that you're listening
to a word I'm saying.

05:26.325 --> 05:28.536
{\an3}David, I hear every word
you're saying, okay?

05:28.619 --> 05:30.580
Look, why don't you look
at it on the bright side?

05:30.663 --> 05:33.082
{\an3}Now we don't have
to feel guilty.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.959
Guilty about what?

05:38.671 --> 05:41.174
{\an3}This video's going
to be killer.

05:44.802 --> 05:46.721
{\an4}STEVE:
Hey, hey, buddy,
where are you going?

05:46.804 --> 05:48.264
{\an3}I gotta go to the
Student Senate.

05:48.347 --> 05:49.432
Wait a second.

05:49.515 --> 05:50.475
{\an1}Isn't Diaz and his crew
challenging your presidency?

05:50.558 --> 05:52.602
Yeah, they are,

05:52.685 --> 05:54.604
but until the Student Court
decides what to do with me,

05:54.687 --> 05:56.606
I still have to call
every meeting to order.

05:56.689 --> 05:57.565
Oh, you're kidding?

05:57.648 --> 05:59.192
Yeah, it's a total farce.

06:00.443 --> 06:01.611
{\an1}Was that your voice
I heard in my kitchen

06:01.694 --> 06:03.738
at 8:00 this morning?

06:03.821 --> 06:04.947
What can I say, man?

06:05.031 --> 06:05.448
Love is in the air.

06:05.531 --> 06:06.616
Valerie kissed me.

06:06.699 --> 06:09.619
{\an1}A kiss.
Isn't that cute?

06:09.702 --> 06:11.079
You guys are getting serious.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.580
{\an3}If I don't make it
with this girl soon,

06:12.663 --> 06:14.332
I won't be able to walk.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.292
{\an3}I'm telling you, she's got
a tongue, it's lethal.

06:16.375 --> 06:17.794
I don't need to know this.
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.295
It's not like it's
your sister, man.

06:19.378 --> 06:20.129
I don't...
Buddy, buddy,

06:20.213 --> 06:22.465
{\an3}I've been a perfect
gentleman, okay?

06:22.548 --> 06:25.009
I went out, I bought her
a huge box of chocolates

06:25.093 --> 06:26.803
{\an3}to celebrate her
first month in L.A.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.138
{\an1}That's nice.
Sweets for your sweet, huh?

06:29.222 --> 06:29.972
Funny.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.974
{\an3}I'm beginning to realize
with Valerie,

06:32.058 --> 06:32.642
{\an3}it's the little things
that count.

06:32.725 --> 06:33.643
Well, that works out for you.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.770
Listen to me,
I'm serious.

06:35.853 --> 06:37.605
When all is said and done,

06:37.688 --> 06:40.149
she's really just an
old-fashioned all-American girl.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.652
Well, yes, I know,
I had very good credit.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.613
That's why I don't feel
it's out of line

06:45.696 --> 06:48.366
to ask for a little play here.

06:48.449 --> 06:51.119
Well, I'm just in between
business managers at the moment.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.705
{\an1}Look, you know what
the situation is.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.958
{\an1}Get back to me
by the end of the month

06:57.041 --> 06:58.668
with the papers, all right?

06:58.751 --> 07:01.504
What are you doing
sneaking in here?

07:01.587 --> 07:02.046
I wanted to surprise you.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.714
I don't appreciate you

07:03.798 --> 07:05.675
dropping in here unannounced
and listening to my business.

07:05.758 --> 07:09.178
I don't even know
what you were talking about.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.638
I just came by because I wanted

07:10.721 --> 07:14.642
to celebrate my one-month
anniversary as a left coaster.

07:14.725 --> 07:17.854
{\an1}Well, you definitely came
to the wrong place.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.689
{\an1}Why don't you try
the KEG House or something?

07:19.772 --> 07:21.065
{\an3}Come on.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.484
{\an3}I went to all this trouble
to buy you a present.

07:23.568 --> 07:24.694
Didn't Brenda ever
buy you chocolates?

07:24.777 --> 07:27.238
No, she didn't.

07:27.321 --> 07:30.074
And she didn't just show up
on my doorstep either.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.409
I don't like it.

07:31.492 --> 07:32.910
If you're gonna come over,
call first.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.541
Hello, Dylan?

07:38.624 --> 07:39.709
This is Valerie.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.712
I was wondering if I could
come over and do it with you

07:42.795 --> 07:46.591
{\an1}with the lights on
and the blinds open.

07:48.467 --> 07:49.635
Got any caramel in that box?

07:49.719 --> 07:51.679
I don't know.

07:51.762 --> 07:54.223
{\an1}Why don't we go in your room
and find out?

07:54.307 --> 07:55.892
Why don't we find out
right here?

07:58.895 --> 08:02.190
Oh, honey, do you think
I like being

08:02.273 --> 08:03.900
on my feet all night,
pouring drinks for people

08:03.983 --> 08:06.903
who have watches worth more
than our joint bank account?

08:06.986 --> 08:08.571
Jesse, I'm fine.

08:08.654 --> 08:09.572
{\an1}I'm happy being home
with Hannah.

08:09.655 --> 08:10.740
No, you're not.

08:10.823 --> 08:13.576
You've been staring at me
with resentment

08:13.659 --> 08:14.327
ever since I got dressed.

08:14.410 --> 08:15.703
{\an1}Hey, that's your guilt,
not mine.

08:15.786 --> 08:19.207
{\an1}I've been staring at you
because you look so handsome.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.751
Oh, okay. In that case,
let's change the subject.

08:21.834 --> 08:25.630
Okay, but first, who are you
getting so handsome for?

08:25.713 --> 08:28.424
All of my secret lovers,
of course.

08:28.507 --> 08:29.425
{\an1}Oh.

08:29.508 --> 08:29.759
Send them my best.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.802
{\an3}I will.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.263
(laughs)

08:34.347 --> 08:36.640
Just know, someday...

08:36.724 --> 08:38.601
when I'm the district attorney,

08:38.683 --> 08:40.645
and you are the busiest doctor
on the Westside,

08:40.727 --> 08:44.273
we're gonna look back on these
dog days and remember them

08:44.357 --> 08:44.649
as the happiest of our lives.

08:44.732 --> 08:45.858
Aren't they?

08:48.569 --> 08:50.488
{\an4}What do you say
Friday night,
Mm-hmm.

08:50.571 --> 08:53.491
{\an1}we get a babysitter, and then
just you and I can go out

08:53.574 --> 08:55.117
{\an1}for a romantic little dinner,
Dr. Zuckerman?

08:55.201 --> 08:58.454
Mm, excellent notion,
Counselor.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.872
I like that. Mm.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.919
We're not just gonna
give them I.Q. tests.

09:05.002 --> 09:07.630
There's gonna be other stuff
running through the video, too.

09:07.713 --> 09:08.839
{\an1}Well, you'd better
keep it simple

09:08.923 --> 09:10.132
{\an1}if you expect guys
like Brandon

09:10.216 --> 09:11.592
{\an1}to subject themselves
to this.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.135
{\an3}Well, we'll go easy
on Brandon.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.596
{\an3}I'm probably just gonna use
him in the chorus anyway.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.473
He's not much
of a singer.

09:17.557 --> 09:21.352
{\an3}Well, it's more of
a tonal poem.

09:21.435 --> 09:25.273
See, what I'm gonna try to do
is, um, trick a bunch of guys

09:25.356 --> 09:26.232
into each saying
a different word.

09:26.315 --> 09:28.359
{\an3}And then when we edit
the words together,

09:28.442 --> 09:29.819
{\an3}it'll sound
something like...

09:29.902 --> 09:31.320
"I'm...

09:31.404 --> 09:32.321
a...

09:32.405 --> 09:32.989
stud...

09:33.072 --> 09:33.656
muffin...

09:33.739 --> 09:33.990
baby."

09:34.073 --> 09:34.824
Get it?

09:34.907 --> 09:37.159
(laughs)

09:37.243 --> 09:39.036
Are you sure this is journalism?

09:39.120 --> 09:40.496
Sounds more like terrorism.

09:40.579 --> 09:41.330
Hmm... journalism,

09:41.414 --> 09:44.667
{\an3}terrorism,
what's the difference?

09:44.750 --> 09:46.460
Are you aware
that you were working

09:46.544 --> 09:48.212
with a very crazy person?

09:48.296 --> 09:49.672
{\an1}Hmm. I know.
Isn't it great?

09:49.755 --> 09:50.381
What'd Steve say?

09:50.464 --> 09:52.216
{\an1}Oh, he said
he would be honored

09:52.300 --> 09:52.800
{\an1}to be part
of the Himbo Hall of Fame.

09:52.883 --> 09:53.843
Big surprise.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.637
You know, I had no idea

09:56.721 --> 09:57.847
Steve was so hung up on Valerie.

10:06.480 --> 10:08.024
{\an1}So, what do you
think of Valerie?

10:08.107 --> 10:10.109
She's great.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.528
{\an3}She's not?

10:12.611 --> 10:14.030
She's a closet stoner.

10:14.113 --> 10:16.490
{\an3}Oh... What, did Brandon
tell you that?

10:16.574 --> 10:18.367
{\an1}No. I was in her room,
and it reeked.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.410
Are you sure?

10:19.493 --> 10:20.119
Yes.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.371
I just don't know why she felt

10:22.455 --> 10:23.873
like she had to lie about it.

10:23.956 --> 10:27.668
{\an3}Well, maybe she was afraid
Jim and Cindy would find out.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.337
No, I don't think that's it.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.505
{\an1}I think she wants
us all to think

10:31.589 --> 10:35.843
that she is some sweet,
innocent thing from the boonies,

10:35.926 --> 10:38.429
{\an1}when really she's a lot more
complicated than that.

10:38.512 --> 10:39.722
Here you go again.

10:39.805 --> 10:40.556
What?

10:40.639 --> 10:41.515
{\an3}You do this
all the time.

10:41.599 --> 10:42.058
You read things into people

10:42.141 --> 10:43.893
that just aren't there.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.019
I do not.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.520
What about with
Dylan's family?

10:46.604 --> 10:47.438
You totally thought

10:47.521 --> 10:48.564
Suzanne and Kevin
were ripping him off,

10:48.647 --> 10:50.566
when they all wound up going
into business together.

10:50.649 --> 10:51.567
This is different.

10:51.650 --> 10:53.944
I caught Valerie in a lie.

10:54.028 --> 10:56.072
Well, maybe you did.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.074
{\an3}But what's the point?
Let it go.

10:58.157 --> 11:00.409
Otherwise, it's just going to
come between you and Brandon

11:00.493 --> 11:02.870
{\an3}the same way it came
between you and Dylan.

11:02.953 --> 11:05.081
You're probably right.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.541
Maybe it was incense.

11:11.170 --> 11:11.879
♪ Yes, I'm crazy over you... ♪

11:11.962 --> 11:12.880
(Valerie laughing)

11:12.963 --> 11:13.881
{\an1}STEVE:
Come on.

11:13.964 --> 11:16.425
Okay.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.968
{\an1}Oh, so close!
Try again.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.428
Come on, let's go
for distance next.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.930
Steve. I don't
do distance.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.223
Why not?

11:22.306 --> 11:23.766
{\an3}Because it gets messy
when you miss.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.810
{\an1}But you never miss.
You're a pro. Come on.

11:25.893 --> 11:28.854
{\an4}DYLAN:
Man, the Peach Pit's really
hopping tonight, huh, Nat?

11:28.938 --> 11:30.064
Hey, Dylan. Come here.

11:30.147 --> 11:31.440
Let me buy you
a French fry.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.109
(groans)

11:33.192 --> 11:34.402
You remember Dylan?

11:34.485 --> 11:36.404
Yeah, sure. How you doing?

11:36.487 --> 11:37.655
{\an1}I'm doing okay.
It's my restaurant

11:37.738 --> 11:39.407
that's on life support.

11:39.490 --> 11:40.449
Listen to this guy.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.200
Every night he's
busting my chops.

11:41.283 --> 11:43.452
{\an1}Because we're
empty every night.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.745
{\an1}NAT:
But it's the same

11:44.829 --> 11:46.914
{\an1}all over town.
Hotels, restaurants.

11:46.997 --> 11:48.958
{\an3}Nothing's been the same
since the quake.

11:49.041 --> 11:49.792
{\an3}I guess a burger
and a jukebox

11:49.875 --> 11:52.670
doesn't make for a
hot date anymore.

11:52.753 --> 11:55.339
You know, the whole town
hasn't gone to sleep.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.924
{\an3}In fact, I could take you
to ten places right now

11:57.007 --> 11:59.635
{\an3}where there's kids
lining up to get in.

11:59.718 --> 12:01.679
{\an3}You could turn
the Pit into a...

12:01.762 --> 12:03.472
an after-hours
kind of joint.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.473
What, are you kidding me?

12:04.557 --> 12:05.474
{\an1}I think we ought to
shut it down

12:05.558 --> 12:06.851
{\an5}and save on the
electricity.
Listen to me.

12:06.934 --> 12:10.438
Everybody is always looking
for the next hot spot.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.148
With the right lights,
a cool sound system,

12:12.231 --> 12:14.316
I could pack this place
at ten bucks a head.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.485
Come on, what do we know
about running a club?

12:16.569 --> 12:17.611
{\an3}Well, it just so
happens I'm

12:17.695 --> 12:18.946
on a roll as the party meister

12:19.029 --> 12:20.489
of C.U., thank you very much.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.032
{\an1}Come on Steve,
get real, would you?

12:22.116 --> 12:23.701
Who's going someplace where
there's no booze, huh?

12:23.784 --> 12:25.035
Are you saying I can't
pull this off? Is that it?

12:25.119 --> 12:27.371
No, I didn't say that.

12:27.455 --> 12:28.831
{\an3}Then just say the word.
We'll test it out.

12:28.914 --> 12:29.999
I'll turn this place

12:30.082 --> 12:30.958
into a first-class
rave this weekend.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.877
I bet it could be
a real moneymaker.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.713
Oh, you do, huh?

12:36.547 --> 12:38.507
Come on, Nat,
let me do it,

12:38.591 --> 12:40.176
just to shut this guy up.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.011
It's not just

12:42.094 --> 12:43.679
my decision.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.227
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.146
It's only money, right?

12:52.229 --> 12:53.522
Well, then, I say,
let's rave on.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.565
{\an3}Okay,

12:54.648 --> 12:56.692
then step back, 'cause
this man needs a phone.

12:56.775 --> 12:57.902
Yeah, this man
needs a doctor.

12:57.985 --> 12:59.528
Who are you calling?

12:59.612 --> 12:59.987
{\an3}For starters,
everyone I know.

13:02.072 --> 13:02.990
(Steve laughs)

13:03.073 --> 13:05.367
{\an3}Am I crazy or did
I just agree

13:05.451 --> 13:06.869
{\an3}to let Steve Sanders
run this joint?

13:06.952 --> 13:09.205
Both.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.998
I think I'd better
keep an eye on him.

13:15.419 --> 13:18.255
So, you coming over
tonight or what?

13:18.339 --> 13:21.383
Thought you'd never ask.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.103
I don't know how you

13:33.187 --> 13:34.730
can stand this stuff.

13:34.813 --> 13:36.357
Why, is it bothering you?

13:36.440 --> 13:38.025
Well, it does waft
across the bathroom

13:38.108 --> 13:38.943
{\an1}on quite a regular
basis, yes.

13:39.026 --> 13:42.571
I'm sorry. I'll lay
off it if you want.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.906
That's probably not
the only thing

13:43.989 --> 13:45.449
you should lay off.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.535
What's that
supposed to mean?

13:47.618 --> 13:48.577
{\an3}Well,

13:48.661 --> 13:50.120
Kelly said,
when she came up here

13:50.204 --> 13:53.040
the other day, it smelled
like you'd been smoking pot.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.085
Well, Kelly was wrong.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.254
Besides, even if I
was smoking pot--

13:58.337 --> 13:59.630
which I wasn't--

13:59.713 --> 14:01.131
do you think
I'd be stupid enough

14:01.215 --> 14:02.383
to smoke it in the house?

14:02.466 --> 14:04.760
Good, good, good,

14:04.843 --> 14:07.638
because Jim and Cindy don't
take too kindly to that.

14:09.306 --> 14:10.849
I know that.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.102
What?

14:13.185 --> 14:16.230
Nothing. I, I don't want
to say anything.

14:16.313 --> 14:17.189
What?

14:17.273 --> 14:19.441
Okay.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.359
Let's face it.

14:20.442 --> 14:22.653
We both know that
your, uh, girlfriend

14:22.736 --> 14:23.946
doesn't like me very much.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.447
{\an3}That's not
true at all.

14:25.531 --> 14:26.282
Kelly can just
be hard on people

14:26.365 --> 14:28.284
she doesn't know
that well, that's all.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.744
So, in other words,
Kelly's a snob?

14:30.828 --> 14:31.620
{\an3}No,

14:31.704 --> 14:34.707
I wouldn't say that.
She's just, uh...

14:34.790 --> 14:37.251
a very cautious person.

14:38.877 --> 14:42.172
So, how's it going with
the Peach Pit After Dark?

14:42.256 --> 14:45.551
{\an1}Well, it's gonna be two days
of nonstop partying,

14:45.634 --> 14:47.303
so you'd better dance.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.637
{\an3}Well, if it'll
smooth things over

14:48.721 --> 14:50.180
between you and Kelly,
I just might do that.

14:50.264 --> 14:55.311
Look, Brandon...
I just want to fit in.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.979
Then just be yourself.

14:57.062 --> 14:57.271
You'll do fine.

14:59.189 --> 15:00.441
Okay.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.156
Okay, that was great.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.490
Now give me a word

15:08.574 --> 15:10.451
that follows each
of the following:

15:10.534 --> 15:13.370
Blueberry, bran

15:13.454 --> 15:13.996
and English.

15:14.079 --> 15:17.124
Um... muffin.

15:17.207 --> 15:18.083
(snickering)

15:18.167 --> 15:19.168
Sorry.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.670
{\an1}Can you ask him
the question again?

15:21.754 --> 15:23.172
{\an1}I don't know what
got into me. Sorry.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.798
Okay.

15:24.882 --> 15:26.175
{\an1}Once again,
the answer is...?

15:26.258 --> 15:27.343
Muffin!

15:27.426 --> 15:29.178
Excellent. Thank you.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.138
Did I pass the test?

15:31.221 --> 15:33.182
With flying colors.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.475
Yes!

15:34.558 --> 15:35.726
Let's go, guys.

15:37.770 --> 15:38.604
You are unbelievable.

15:38.687 --> 15:40.898
I don't know how you
keep a straight face

15:40.981 --> 15:42.524
with these guys. Oh...

15:42.608 --> 15:43.400
{\an3}Believe me,
with that one,

15:43.484 --> 15:47.196
{\an3}I thought I was gonna
pee in my pants!

15:47.279 --> 15:50.699
{\an1}Okay, come on, we gotta
find another victim.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.201
{\an1}Mm... Mmm!

15:52.284 --> 15:53.702
A blue-collar boy.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.373
Oh, no. That's not
fair. He's working.

15:57.456 --> 15:58.248
He's meat. Come on.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.296
Excuse me!

16:04.380 --> 16:05.255
{\an1}Hello!

16:05.339 --> 16:06.298
Hi.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.175
{\an3}I'm sorry.

16:08.258 --> 16:09.551
This area's off-limits.

16:09.635 --> 16:10.969
{\an3}Oh, that's okay.
We just need

16:11.053 --> 16:12.429
{\an3}to ask you
a couple questions.

16:12.513 --> 16:13.722
Me? About what?

16:13.806 --> 16:14.348
Well, it's a,
it's a kind

16:14.431 --> 16:16.058
{\an1}of trivia test.
We'd like

16:16.141 --> 16:17.685
{\an1}to interview you
for campus television.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.269
I'm not a student here.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.562
{\an1}CLARE:
Oh, that's all right.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.231
We're just looking for
a cross-section of male voices.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.232
{\an3}For real?

16:23.315 --> 16:25.192
{\an1}CLARE:
Of course, for real.

16:25.275 --> 16:26.193
Yeah. It would
really help us out.

16:26.276 --> 16:28.195
All right, well,
in that case, uh...

16:28.278 --> 16:30.114
come back at 5:00. I'm off.

16:30.197 --> 16:32.241
Great. Thanks.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.413
I think we have
a live one here.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.373
Definitely.
(giggles)

16:42.167 --> 16:43.794
{\an4}STEVE:
Be careful.
Don't bump this thing.

16:43.877 --> 16:45.129
It's a classic, okay?

16:45.212 --> 16:46.130
{\an3}(chuckles)
What do you think?

16:46.213 --> 16:49.258
{\an1}How much is this
costing me, Steve?

16:49.341 --> 16:50.759
{\an3}Oh, will you take
a chill pill?

16:50.843 --> 16:52.136
{\an3}Everything you see here
is on "spec", okay?

16:52.219 --> 16:54.596
{\an3}If the club becomes
a weekly thing,

16:54.680 --> 16:56.390
then all I want is a
piece of the action.

16:56.473 --> 16:57.599
How can you go wrong?

16:57.683 --> 16:58.475
{\an1}So, what're you telling
me here, Steve?

16:58.559 --> 17:01.228
That these people are
donating this stuff?

17:01.311 --> 17:03.397
{\an3}Well, everything except
Muntz's Smart Drinks.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.897
{\an5}MUNTZ:
Well, hey,
when you're dealing

17:04.982 --> 17:08.234
with choline-based vitamins,
nobody rides for free.

17:08.318 --> 17:09.444
What's he talking about?

17:09.528 --> 17:11.446
If we're having a
nonalcoholic rave,

17:11.530 --> 17:13.741
then we have to
have "smart drinks."

17:13.824 --> 17:14.700
{\an3}Besides,
it's delicious.

17:14.782 --> 17:17.453
{\an3}They're actually good
for your head, too.

17:17.536 --> 17:18.954
{\an1}How much?

17:19.038 --> 17:20.789
Well, I figure a hundred
bucks ought to cover it.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.583
{\an3}I'll do a combination
punch of my

17:22.665 --> 17:24.376
Mint Memory Blast and
my Cherry Brain Fuel.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.419
Come on, a hundred bucks?

17:25.502 --> 17:26.462
You burp that.

17:26.545 --> 17:29.131
{\an1}I say give him two shots
of the brain fuel.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.008
Fine. I'll cover it.

17:31.091 --> 17:32.384
Okay.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.220
{\an3}(laughs)

17:50.903 --> 17:52.863
I see someone's been shopping.

17:52.946 --> 17:54.698
Yeah, I think I went
a little nuts today.

17:54.782 --> 17:55.324
{\an3}Cindy told me
about this place

17:55.407 --> 17:56.325
down in Santa Monica

17:56.408 --> 17:58.327
{\an3}where everything
is 60% off.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.454
Pippa's Place.

18:00.537 --> 18:01.371
{\an3}I've never seen
anything like it.

18:01.455 --> 18:04.166
{\an1}Brenda and I used to
practically live there.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.959
So, what'd you get?

18:06.043 --> 18:07.377
{\an3}Well, you want
me to try it on?

18:07.461 --> 18:08.545
{\an3}Sure. Come on.
Okay.

18:08.629 --> 18:09.213
{\an3}Okay. So how's it
going in there?

18:09.296 --> 18:12.341
Steve's doing a great job.

18:12.424 --> 18:13.467
Cool.

18:14.259 --> 18:17.679
So, uh, maybe we can
go shopping sometime,

18:17.763 --> 18:19.181
or, uh, just hang out.

18:19.264 --> 18:20.182
Yeah, I'd like that.

18:20.265 --> 18:21.350
Okay. I'll be right back.

18:21.433 --> 18:22.351
I'll be here.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.228
{\an1}Okay.

18:27.564 --> 18:29.191
Hi, Nat. How's it going?

18:29.274 --> 18:30.067
Oh... ask me tomorrow.

18:30.150 --> 18:32.236
{\an1}Well, I passed out
hundreds of these flyers

18:32.319 --> 18:32.778
{\an1}up and down
Sorority Row.

18:32.861 --> 18:33.362
Everybody's up for it.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.240
Aw, thanks, sweetheart.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.533
Ah, take 'em.

18:38.325 --> 18:39.368
(sighs)

18:52.548 --> 18:55.008
It's nice to see you
back among the living.

18:55.092 --> 18:58.220
If this is living,
it's way overrated.

19:00.430 --> 19:03.725
Well, I hope tonight's
a big success.

19:03.809 --> 19:07.396
Yeah, I do, too-- for
Steve's sake, and for Nat.

19:07.479 --> 19:08.939
And for you?

19:09.022 --> 19:10.232
Come on, Kel.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.109
{\an1}You know it doesn't make
any difference to me.

19:12.192 --> 19:14.236
I just roll with the punches.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.491
I was in Minnesota this summer,

19:19.575 --> 19:22.244
and, um, we stopped
by a reservation.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.413
I picked up an authentic

19:24.496 --> 19:27.249
Native American
flute for Erica.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.083
I couldn't help myself.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.502
{\an3}I remembered how much
she loved music.

19:30.586 --> 19:33.380
{\an3}So if I drop it off, do you
think you could get it to her?

19:33.463 --> 19:36.258
Yeah, she'll probably
like that a lot.

19:36.341 --> 19:40.178
How are Suzanne and Kevin
doing in Arizona?

19:40.262 --> 19:42.431
How do you think
they're doing?

19:43.348 --> 19:46.685
You know, it's okay,
you can say I told you so.

19:48.687 --> 19:51.356
I'll let you off
the hook this time.

19:53.692 --> 19:54.359
So, is this acceptable?

19:54.443 --> 19:56.445
{\an3}STEVE:
Acceptable...

19:56.528 --> 19:59.489
{\an3}delectable
and irresistible.

20:01.325 --> 20:01.658
Love the shoes.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.077
Oh, thank you.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.288
{\an3}Excuse me,
I'm melting.

20:06.371 --> 20:09.541
(Valerie giggles)

20:09.541 --> 20:12.211
So what do you
think of Valerie?

20:12.461 --> 20:16.590
To tell you the truth,
I don't know her very well.

20:23.597 --> 20:27.476
Hey. Remember me?

20:27.559 --> 20:28.310
{\an1}Yeah, I didn't
think you'd show.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.312
Sorry I'm late.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.313
Where's your friend?

20:31.396 --> 20:33.982
Oh, she got stuck in class.

20:34.066 --> 20:37.277
{\an3}Well, if you'll just stand
in front of your truck,

20:37.361 --> 20:40.030
{\an1}I'll get focused
and you can be on your way.

20:40.113 --> 20:41.281
No problem.

20:41.365 --> 20:43.492
{\an3}Oh, I-I need you
to sign this release form.

20:45.535 --> 20:48.664
{\an3}So, uh, what kind of work
are you guys doing?

20:48.747 --> 20:51.458
I'm sorry, I didn't
even get your name.

20:51.541 --> 20:54.002
Oh, Ray. Ray Pruit.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.671
It's all earthquake-related.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.006
Just, uh, helping out
with the retrofitting,

20:58.090 --> 20:59.508
{\an1}getting everything
a little safer.

20:59.591 --> 21:00.842
Oh, that's great.

21:00.926 --> 21:02.094
I'm Donna.

21:02.177 --> 21:02.469
Hey, Donna.

21:03.553 --> 21:05.514
{\an3}Thank you.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.849
Well, we need to match the tape
that we made before,

21:07.933 --> 21:09.643
so if, uh, you'll just go ahead
and take your shirt off,

21:09.726 --> 21:10.978
that, that'd be great.

21:11.061 --> 21:13.230
Uh, you didn't shoot
any tape earlier.

21:13.313 --> 21:14.523
Oh.

21:15.565 --> 21:17.609
It's okay, I'm not shy.

21:22.447 --> 21:23.532
Okay. You ready?

21:23.615 --> 21:25.409
Fire away.

21:25.492 --> 21:28.078
{\an3}Okay, the first question
is about tennis.

21:28.161 --> 21:31.415
Okay, what is the term
if the score is zero?

21:31.498 --> 21:32.499
I don't know a thing
about tennis.

21:32.582 --> 21:36.336
Oh, that's okay.
It's "love."

21:36.420 --> 21:36.712
Love. Right.

21:36.795 --> 21:37.671
{\an3}Okay, uh,

21:37.754 --> 21:41.341
so what would it be
if it was zero-to-zero?

21:41.425 --> 21:43.135
Love-love.

21:43.218 --> 21:44.594
What is this,
some kind of test?

21:44.678 --> 21:45.512
Yeah, exactly.

21:45.595 --> 21:48.098
Um, the next question's
about carpentry.

21:48.181 --> 21:48.432
You're probably good
at that, right?

21:48.515 --> 21:50.225
Not bad.

21:50.308 --> 21:51.393
{\an3}Well, if
you're hanging

21:51.476 --> 21:52.477
something heavy on the wall,

21:52.561 --> 21:55.063
you want to hammer the nail
into what to make sure

21:55.147 --> 21:55.397
{\an3}it doesn't
fall down?

21:55.480 --> 21:57.899
A stud.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.568
Excellent.

21:59.651 --> 22:01.236
What kind of test
is this anyway?

22:01.319 --> 22:03.071
Oh, uh...

22:03.155 --> 22:05.532
Don't worry, I just have
a few more questions.

22:05.615 --> 22:07.534
When a woman
is pregnant

22:07.617 --> 22:08.535
she looks forward
to delivering a...

22:08.618 --> 22:10.954
Why don't you
turn off the camera.

22:11.038 --> 22:13.040
What's wrong?

22:13.123 --> 22:13.749
What's wrong?

22:13.832 --> 22:15.792
What do you think, I'm stupid?

22:15.876 --> 22:18.545
Why don't you ask me which
president is on a Lincoln penny?

22:18.628 --> 22:21.339
Please, it was,
it was just a joke.

22:21.423 --> 22:22.883
Yeah, very funny.

22:22.966 --> 22:23.550
What is this, rich bitch humor?

22:23.633 --> 22:26.470
Look, I'm sorry.

22:26.553 --> 22:27.763
It's not what you think.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.264
{\an1}Oh, no? You weren't
just looking

22:29.347 --> 22:31.933
{\an1}for some dope who works
with his hands for a living?

22:32.017 --> 22:33.602
No. We've interviewed
mostly college guys.

22:33.685 --> 22:34.603
Yeah, right.

22:34.686 --> 22:36.229
But they know all the answers.

22:36.313 --> 22:37.773
Go ahead, you got
your funny video.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.649
{\an1}You got my signed
release form,

22:41.526 --> 22:42.527
Have a good laugh.

22:42.611 --> 22:45.405
Wait, I'm...

22:53.705 --> 22:55.624
ANDREA:
Hey, it's no big deal.

22:55.707 --> 22:58.126
Well, it's...
it's not an emergency.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.169
It's okay.

22:59.252 --> 23:00.587
No, okay.

23:00.670 --> 23:01.755
All right, thanks.

23:01.838 --> 23:02.631
Bye.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.091
Well?

23:04.174 --> 23:08.011
Well, that was your sister
calling back. No luck.

23:08.095 --> 23:09.471
{\an6}That's everybody,
isn't it?
Mm.

23:09.554 --> 23:10.722
{\an3}I'm sorry,
sweetheart.

23:10.806 --> 23:12.015
Maybe you shouldn't have sent
your grandmother home.

23:12.099 --> 23:13.141
{\an1}Come on, you heard
Rose coughing.

23:13.225 --> 23:16.103
There's no way I was gonna
let her be around Hannah.

23:16.186 --> 23:18.480
Well, if we're not going out,
I might as well get to work.

23:18.563 --> 23:22.317
Great. Just great.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.610
{\an3}Come on, Friday
night's a big night.

23:23.693 --> 23:25.487
{\an3}Look, they can use the help,
and we can use the money.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.613
I know, I know.

23:26.696 --> 23:29.616
It's just... I feel like
going out tonight, too.

23:29.699 --> 23:31.493
It just sucks.

23:31.576 --> 23:32.702
Andrea!

23:32.786 --> 23:34.830
I'm sorry.

23:34.913 --> 23:37.332
{\an1}It's just that everybody
is going to be at

23:37.415 --> 23:38.583
{\an1}the Peach Pit tonight,
except for me.

23:38.667 --> 23:42.504
Well, the Peach Pit After Dark
is going on tomorrow night, too.

23:42.587 --> 23:43.880
{\an3}The Walshes said they'd
take care of Hannah.

23:43.964 --> 23:45.006
You can wait 24 hours.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.300
Yeah, I guess.

23:47.384 --> 23:49.136
{\an1}Look...

23:49.219 --> 23:51.555
{\an1}have a good night.
Make big tips.

23:51.638 --> 23:53.598
That's the idea.

24:04.401 --> 24:06.778
(techno-pop playing
inside the Peach Pit)

24:14.119 --> 24:16.580
{\an3}STEVE:
I recommend the punch.

24:16.663 --> 24:19.249
Steve, she says she was supposed
to be on the guest list.

24:19.332 --> 24:20.250
Her name is...

24:20.333 --> 24:21.251
Clare Arnold.

24:21.334 --> 24:22.043
Hello, Clare.

24:22.127 --> 24:23.044
{\an3}Hi.

24:23.128 --> 24:24.629
Thank you, Steve.

24:26.798 --> 24:29.593
(door opens, music grows louder)

24:50.697 --> 24:52.574
I see you out there.

25:15.889 --> 25:19.184
Karaoke bombed, but this
is wacky enough to work.

25:19.267 --> 25:20.810
{\an1}Yeah, Steve's definitely
outdone himself.

25:20.894 --> 25:22.812
Yes, yes.

25:24.564 --> 25:26.942
Oh, there goes Clare
straight for David.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.360
{\an1}BRANDON:
Are they an item?

25:28.443 --> 25:29.444
{\an3}KELLY:
Getting there.

25:29.527 --> 25:30.612
Better him than me.

25:30.695 --> 25:33.490
My thoughts exactly.

25:35.825 --> 25:36.326
Thank you very much.

25:36.409 --> 25:37.953
{\an3}Hey, man.
Hey, bro.

25:38.036 --> 25:40.038
I bet you didn't expect
a crowd like this, huh?

25:40.121 --> 25:41.414
Yeah, too bad
I hate crowds.

25:41.498 --> 25:42.624
Well, that's too bad.

25:42.707 --> 25:44.125
Just remember that each one
of these people

25:44.209 --> 25:44.834
are paying ten bucks
a head, okay?

25:44.918 --> 25:47.128
Do me a favor, take over.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.005
I gotta go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

25:49.089 --> 25:50.465
{\an5}Yeah.
Don't forget
to click 'em in.

25:50.548 --> 25:51.633
{\an3}All right.

25:51.716 --> 25:53.969
Dude, can you...
break a large bill?

25:54.052 --> 25:55.804
Yeah.

25:55.887 --> 26:00.642
Aren't you supposed to put
the money in the cash box?

26:00.725 --> 26:01.768
I am the cash box.

26:06.940 --> 26:10.110
So, bro, what do you
think of this place?

26:10.193 --> 26:13.154
I got to admit, Steve, you put
on quite a shindig here, my man.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.614
Yes, I did, didn't I?

26:14.698 --> 26:15.824
{\an3}You know what, I gotta
hurry up and relieve Dylan

26:15.907 --> 26:17.826
{\an3}before he deserts his post.
I'll catch up with you later.

26:17.909 --> 26:20.578
Party hearty!

26:26.710 --> 26:28.795
Griffin's not a
bad dancer, is he?

26:28.878 --> 26:29.838
{\an1}CLARE:
Are you planning on staring

26:29.921 --> 26:33.383
at them all night?

26:33.466 --> 26:34.718
No.

26:40.056 --> 26:41.308
Over here.

26:41.391 --> 26:42.392
What?

26:42.475 --> 26:45.061
{\an1}I just like it a lot better
when your eyes are on me.

26:45.145 --> 26:47.063
Oh, I'm sorry.

26:50.608 --> 26:50.942
How's that?

26:51.026 --> 26:54.154
Much better.

26:54.237 --> 26:55.739
{\an1}Oh, my God,
I don't believe it.

26:55.822 --> 26:57.157
{\an1}Look who's on
the dance floor.

26:57.240 --> 26:57.824
I don't think so.

26:59.743 --> 27:00.702
(shrieks)
Whoa!

27:00.785 --> 27:03.163
Guys, guys, guys.
It's okay. It's all right.

27:03.246 --> 27:03.913
Uh, Kelly, there's a mop
in the back room.

27:03.997 --> 27:06.499
Go get it for me,
would you?

27:06.583 --> 27:07.876
(glass crunching)

27:09.919 --> 27:12.047
Look, it's
all right, bro.

27:12.130 --> 27:15.550
(techno-pop continues)

27:15.633 --> 27:18.178
(woman giggling)

27:18.261 --> 27:18.887
(bag contents clatter)

27:18.970 --> 27:21.890
{\an1}DYLAN:
Hey! This room's private!

27:21.973 --> 27:23.725
Get out of here!

27:23.808 --> 27:25.602
(kissing sounds)

27:25.685 --> 27:28.271
(Valerie giggling)

27:28.355 --> 27:30.482
(music continuing)

27:41.659 --> 27:42.702
It's time to celebrate.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.579
I've never seen
so many customers come

27:44.662 --> 27:44.913
in this place in my life.

27:44.996 --> 27:45.955
Sanders,

27:46.039 --> 27:47.916
you're a genius!
You're all geniuses!

27:47.999 --> 27:51.127
No matter what
your professors say!

27:51.211 --> 27:53.213
{\an1}So, how many people
do you think paid, anyway?

27:53.296 --> 27:56.716
Oh, well, I know exactly
how many people paid.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.594
Three hundred and fifty-three!

27:59.677 --> 28:00.595
{\an3}(chuckles)

28:00.678 --> 28:02.889
{\an4}VALERIE:
Wow. At ten bucks
a head, that's...

28:02.972 --> 28:05.433
BOTH:
3,530.

28:05.517 --> 28:06.601
{\an1}Cha-ching!
Hello.

28:06.684 --> 28:07.977
We got a problem.

28:08.061 --> 28:09.729
What's the matter?

28:09.813 --> 28:11.106
{\an5}NAT:
Well, there's, uh,
3,000 and some change here.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.774
{\an3}We're short about three,
four hundred dollars.

28:12.857 --> 28:14.776
Oh, that's impossible.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.069
I don't know,
maybe you counted wrong.

28:16.152 --> 28:18.279
{\an1}I counted every head
that went in that door.

28:18.363 --> 28:19.572
{\an6}BRANDON:
So what? I mean, come on.
What's the big deal?

28:19.656 --> 28:21.574
{\an3}We made three grand.
What's the difference?

28:21.658 --> 28:24.577
{\an1}The big difference is,
we're short $300.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.579
Relax, Steve.
I'll recount.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.790
{\an3}You know, we should be patting
ourselves on the back,

28:28.873 --> 28:31.626
not arguing.

28:31.709 --> 28:34.462
{\an5}Steve.
Oh, hey, Kel,
I didn't know

28:34.546 --> 28:35.630
{\an1}you were still here.
Where's Brandon?

28:35.713 --> 28:37.632
He went home; he has
a big meeting tomorrow.

28:37.715 --> 28:39.801
Can you come with me to my car?

28:39.884 --> 28:40.427
Yeah. What's the matter?

28:40.510 --> 28:42.470
I don't know, the battery.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.305
Yeah.

28:52.605 --> 28:54.065
Wait a second.

28:54.149 --> 28:57.318
Are you telling me that Valerie
and Dylan were making out?

28:57.402 --> 29:00.697
Let's just say, they weren't
fixing the air conditioner.

29:00.780 --> 29:03.658
{\an3}Kelly, who else
saw this?

29:03.741 --> 29:05.577
Oh, Steve, there...

29:06.911 --> 29:07.912
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting something?

29:07.996 --> 29:09.038
No, not at all.

29:09.122 --> 29:11.332
Kelly was just telling me

29:11.416 --> 29:12.667
about you and Dylan
in the back room.

29:12.750 --> 29:14.669
Well...

29:14.752 --> 29:16.754
{\an3}Don't believe
everything you hear,

29:16.838 --> 29:18.006
or half of what you see.

29:18.089 --> 29:19.924
You know, Valerie,
that's not exactly a denial.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.302
There's nothing to deny.

29:22.385 --> 29:23.428
{\an3}Look, I would have
told you myself,

29:23.511 --> 29:26.014
{\an3}but I didn't want everybody
to get on Dylan's case.

29:26.097 --> 29:28.516
I know you guys
are all friends.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.185
Yeah.
So what, what about me and you?

29:30.268 --> 29:30.977
{\an1}Steve...

29:31.060 --> 29:33.521
he was drunk.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.064
{\an1}I happened to be
the one he grabbed.

29:35.148 --> 29:36.733
{\an1}There was nothing
I could do.

29:36.816 --> 29:38.485
Steve, please.

29:38.568 --> 29:40.695
{\an3}He didn't do anything.
I mean, he was so plastered,

29:40.778 --> 29:42.030
{\an1}he probably won't
even remember in the morning.

29:42.113 --> 29:45.658
{\an1}And I'd appreciate it
if you don't mention it

29:45.742 --> 29:46.993
to anybody or to him.

29:47.076 --> 29:49.913
It's kind of embarrassing
for me.

29:49.996 --> 29:52.499
Yeah, I bet.

29:54.083 --> 29:55.919
You know, when Brandon told me
you were hard on new people,

29:56.002 --> 29:59.047
I didn't take him
seriously enough.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.006
You're dangerous.

30:02.425 --> 30:04.177
{\an1}I think it's
the other way around.

30:04.260 --> 30:06.221
Really?

30:06.304 --> 30:07.055
{\an3}Well, if you like
butting in so much,

30:07.138 --> 30:10.892
{\an3}why don't you try it
with Dylan?

30:10.975 --> 30:12.268
Meaning what?

30:12.352 --> 30:13.561
Brenda told me that

30:13.645 --> 30:15.563
your ex-boyfriend
used to be in AA.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.732
{\an3}So if you care
about him at all,

30:17.815 --> 30:21.069
maybe you should get off
your pedestal and help him.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.281
Can you take me home?

30:32.705 --> 30:34.958
Good night, Kel.

30:41.631 --> 30:44.133
{\an5}CLARE:
Okay, no critiques, please;
nothing's finished yet.

30:44.217 --> 30:45.927
{\an3}It's just a rough
assemblage.

30:46.010 --> 30:47.762
{\an3}I just kind of
wanted to give you

30:47.845 --> 30:48.930
{\an3}a feel for what
we're doing.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.723
{\an1}I'm ready.

30:50.807 --> 30:51.683
{\an3}Okay.

30:54.852 --> 30:56.729
I... am... a...

30:56.813 --> 30:58.940
stud... muffin... baby.

30:59.023 --> 31:00.525
{\an1}(laughs)
That's hilarious.

31:00.608 --> 31:02.235
Wait, just wait.

31:02.318 --> 31:03.611
...stud... muffin...

31:03.695 --> 31:04.654
am... I?

31:04.737 --> 31:05.488
(moans)

31:05.572 --> 31:07.907
{\an1}(laughs)

31:07.991 --> 31:09.617
...love, love, love...

31:09.701 --> 31:11.077
{\an1}(laughs)
love, love...

31:11.160 --> 31:13.454
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

31:13.538 --> 31:14.622
Oh, no problem.

31:14.706 --> 31:15.456
{\an1}We're just checking out
the footage

31:15.540 --> 31:18.167
{\an3}on your favorite
construction worker.

31:18.251 --> 31:19.961
I don't want to use
that footage.

31:20.044 --> 31:21.462
Donna, it's hilarious.

31:21.546 --> 31:22.505
DONNA:
No. It's...

31:22.589 --> 31:23.590
It's mean.

31:23.673 --> 31:24.674
{\an1}DAVID: Donna,
it's just a goof.

31:24.757 --> 31:25.925
I mean, wait till
you see the stuff

31:26.009 --> 31:27.135
{\an3}I've got on my
bimbo piece.

31:27.218 --> 31:29.470
Look, you can do whatever
you want with your bimbo piece.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.139
We're not using him, okay?

31:31.222 --> 31:33.141
{\an3}This project is half mine;
that's the way that I want it!

31:33.224 --> 31:35.643
I don't want
to make fun of people.

31:35.727 --> 31:36.811
I want to make people laugh.

31:36.894 --> 31:38.062
There's a big difference.

31:38.146 --> 31:39.022
Okay, okay, fine, uh...

31:39.105 --> 31:41.232
{\an1}What about the stuff
with Griffin?

31:41.316 --> 31:43.026
Do you want to
lose that, too?

31:43.109 --> 31:45.653
No.

31:45.737 --> 31:46.112
Griffin's fine.

31:46.195 --> 31:48.990
{\an1}Great.

31:49.073 --> 31:50.617
You know, I like Griffin.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.118
He seems pretty together.

31:52.201 --> 31:53.161
Yeah, Griffin's very together.

31:53.244 --> 31:55.413
I'm happy for you.

31:55.496 --> 31:57.999
Mm-hmm. Are you sure
you're not just saying that

31:58.082 --> 31:59.500
because you and Clare
are playing footsie

31:59.584 --> 32:00.126
under the table, perhaps?

32:03.087 --> 32:04.547
Absolutely not.

32:04.631 --> 32:05.673
Sure, pal.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.551
GRIFFIN (on video):
Let me get this straight...

32:15.600 --> 32:17.685
Hey, I made some lemonade.

32:17.769 --> 32:18.519
{\an3}Oh, thanks.

32:18.603 --> 32:21.481
{\an1}With honey,
my, uh, secret ingredient.

32:21.564 --> 32:23.316
Didn't your mother
used to make it that way?

32:23.399 --> 32:24.692
{\an1}Yeah.

32:24.776 --> 32:25.985
Mmm!

32:26.069 --> 32:28.696
Don't tell your mom,
but yours is better.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.365
{\an3}Thanks.
So I hear the party

32:30.448 --> 32:32.659
at the Peach Pit last night
was quite a success.

32:32.742 --> 32:34.202
{\an1}Yeah. We're doing it
again tonight.

32:34.285 --> 32:35.161
Really?
Nat must be ecstatic.

32:35.244 --> 32:38.039
So's his partner.

32:38.122 --> 32:40.291
I'm amazed Dylan even cares.

32:40.375 --> 32:41.834
Why's that?

32:41.918 --> 32:43.211
Well, he doesn't need the money.

32:43.294 --> 32:46.339
Are you sure Dylan's rich?

32:46.422 --> 32:49.050
{\an1}Because he sure doesn't seem
like a multimillionaire.

32:49.133 --> 32:50.218
What does he seem like?

32:50.301 --> 32:52.303
{\an1}Honestly?

32:52.387 --> 32:54.263
A guy who needs money.

32:54.347 --> 32:56.224
Don't believe that act.

32:56.307 --> 32:58.226
He's just your typical,
greedy, Beverly Hills brat.

32:58.309 --> 33:00.895
(doorbell chimes)

33:00.978 --> 33:03.731
{\an3}That must be Andrea
and Jesse. Cindy?

33:03.815 --> 33:05.191
Got it.

33:06.984 --> 33:08.111
{\an1}Hello.

33:08.194 --> 33:10.405
Hannah's here.

33:10.488 --> 33:12.407
{\an1}Oh. Well, I guess
you're planning to stay

33:12.490 --> 33:13.533
for a little while, huh?

33:13.616 --> 33:15.785
You didn't think we'd
come empty-handed, did you?

33:15.868 --> 33:17.078
No.

33:17.161 --> 33:18.705
{\an3}All right, Jim,
where do we set up?

33:18.788 --> 33:20.039
In the living room's great.

33:20.123 --> 33:21.249
{\an1}Can I hold her?
Sure.

33:21.332 --> 33:23.042
{\an5}VALERIE:
Hey, Jesse.
Let me help you with that.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.293
There you go.

33:24.377 --> 33:27.422
{\an1}Hi, sweetheart.
We've been waiting for you.

33:27.505 --> 33:29.924
{\an1}Hey, Andrea.
You look great.

33:30.007 --> 33:31.092
Thank you.

33:31.175 --> 33:32.427
Hi, Hannah.

33:32.510 --> 33:33.261
{\an3}Oh, you guys, thanks
for doing this.

33:33.344 --> 33:35.638
BRANDON:
Oh, no need to thank them.

33:35.722 --> 33:36.889
They've been looking
forward to this.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.474
{\an1}Mom even borrowed a swing set
from one of the neighbors.

33:38.558 --> 33:41.310
{\an3}It was my surefire way
to get that one to sleep.

33:41.394 --> 33:42.770
Well, I have
to warn you.

33:42.854 --> 33:43.312
{\an3}She's a little fussy
when she's tired.

33:43.396 --> 33:45.398
That's okay. So is Jim.

33:45.481 --> 33:48.109
{\an3}Andrea, she's
going to be fine.

33:48.192 --> 33:50.611
I know. I guess I'm just
not used to leaving her.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.155
Give it a couple of months.

33:52.238 --> 33:54.115
{\an1}You'll be ready to ship her
off to boarding school.

33:54.198 --> 33:56.617
Yes...
Ooh...

33:56.701 --> 33:58.286
Hey, guys.

33:59.328 --> 34:00.329
Thank you.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.461
Excuse me.

34:06.544 --> 34:07.295
{\an1}I'm looking for one
of your workers.

34:07.378 --> 34:10.005
{\an1}I think he drives
a red pickup truck.

34:10.089 --> 34:11.299
{\an3}That would
be our Elvis.

34:11.382 --> 34:14.761
{\an3}The other side
of the hill.

34:14.844 --> 34:16.554
Thanks a lot.

34:19.514 --> 34:20.641
I just want you to know

34:20.725 --> 34:22.560
{\an3}I made sure that your
interview won't be used.

34:22.643 --> 34:26.813
Oh, yeah?
That's decent of you. Thanks.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.483
I just felt bad
about what happened.

34:28.565 --> 34:30.400
I was really out of line.

34:30.485 --> 34:35.322
Well, I, uh... I probably said
some things I shouldn't have.

34:35.406 --> 34:36.491
{\an3}Believe me,
you, uh...

34:36.574 --> 34:38.326
you had every right to be mad.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.286
{\an3}Why are you being so nice?
I am nice.

34:40.369 --> 34:45.583
You just got the wrong
impression of me the other day.

34:47.752 --> 34:50.338
{\an1}Well, I'll, uh...
I'll see you around.

34:50.420 --> 34:53.007
Yeah.

34:53.090 --> 34:55.342
{\an3}You know, if... if
you like dance music,

34:55.426 --> 34:58.137
{\an3}my friends are
putting together

34:58.221 --> 34:59.555
{\an3}this little
after-hours club.

34:59.639 --> 35:02.183
You should check it out.

35:02.266 --> 35:05.311
Don't worry about
the cover charge.

35:05.394 --> 35:08.189
I have some
free passes.

35:08.272 --> 35:10.691
I don't know.

35:10.775 --> 35:12.360
Please?

35:12.443 --> 35:14.737
I owe you one.

35:14.821 --> 35:16.197
{\an3}I could leave your
name at the door

35:16.280 --> 35:17.365
if you want to go.

35:17.448 --> 35:18.407
{\an3}Uh...

35:18.491 --> 35:20.993
What was your name again?

35:21.077 --> 35:23.704
Ray Pruit. One "T".

35:23.788 --> 35:25.706
{\an1}One "T"?
Yeah. That's all

35:25.790 --> 35:26.958
my mama could afford.

35:27.041 --> 35:28.251
You're kidding, right?

35:28.334 --> 35:31.337
I'll see you.

35:31.420 --> 35:35.383
Okay. See ya.

35:35.466 --> 35:36.509
(playing a lively run)

35:52.608 --> 35:54.193
Don't you look happy.

35:54.277 --> 35:56.654
{\an1}I'd forgotten how sweet
a baby smells.

35:57.655 --> 35:58.406
Yeah, me, too.

36:00.157 --> 36:02.159
(cooing)

36:02.243 --> 36:05.621
{\an3}You know, those days
are just a blur to me.

36:05.705 --> 36:07.456
{\an3}I was so overwhelmed
and so scared,

36:07.540 --> 36:09.584
{\an3}I just don't think
I enjoyed them

36:09.667 --> 36:11.460
{\an3}nearly as much
as I could have.

36:11.544 --> 36:12.879
Yeah, well,
I guess child rearing

36:12.962 --> 36:15.298
is yet another thing
wasted on the young.

36:15.381 --> 36:16.591
Yeah, I guess so.

36:16.674 --> 36:19.760
So how old do you think
is too old?

36:19.844 --> 36:22.388
We're too old.

36:22.471 --> 36:25.975
Women are having babies
well into their 40s these days.

36:26.058 --> 36:26.976
(chuckling)

36:27.059 --> 36:28.436
Wait a minute.

36:28.519 --> 36:30.897
We're not talking about
having another baby, are we?

36:30.980 --> 36:33.107
Oh, no, no...

36:33.190 --> 36:34.942
but there's still probably
a couple of ticks left

36:35.026 --> 36:36.611
in my biological clock.

36:36.694 --> 36:39.614
Honey, it would take
an awful lot of serious thought

36:39.697 --> 36:41.449
before we could even consider
something like that.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.868
I can do serious thought.

36:45.411 --> 36:46.621

36:46.704 --> 36:50.291
{\an1}(chuckles)

36:50.374 --> 36:51.876
(music playing over phone)
Hello.

36:51.959 --> 36:52.960
Oh, hi, Andrea.

36:53.044 --> 36:53.794
(music blaring)
How is everything?

36:53.878 --> 36:57.298
Oh, she's just being
a little angel.

36:57.381 --> 36:58.341
How was your dinner with Jesse?

36:58.424 --> 36:59.383
Delicious.

36:59.467 --> 37:01.093
And the food wasn't bad either.

37:01.177 --> 37:02.470
(Cindy laughs)

37:02.553 --> 37:04.472
Um, I thought I'd come by
and pick up Hannah.

37:04.555 --> 37:05.640
Well, don't rush for our sakes.

37:05.723 --> 37:07.975
We're enjoying every minute
of this.

37:08.059 --> 37:09.143
Are you sure?

37:09.226 --> 37:10.269
Positive.

37:10.353 --> 37:11.479
Now, get off the phone,
have some fun.

37:11.562 --> 37:14.523
All right, well,
give her a hug for me.

37:14.607 --> 37:16.692
I'm gonna go by Doheny's
and surprise Jesse.

37:16.776 --> 37:18.694
Good, have fun.
Bye-bye.

doing me some kind of favor.

38:53.831 --> 38:55.207

her I'm hard on new people?

{\an3}Yeah, it was

a little pot.

a little bit with Dylan.
