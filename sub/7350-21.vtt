00:05.273 --> 00:09.310
* Hello there, my old friend

00:09.343 --> 00:11.479
* Not so long ago

00:11.512 --> 00:14.248
* It was till the end

00:14.282 --> 00:16.317
Her name's
Savannah.

00:16.350 --> 00:19.753
She sits right in front
of me in biology.

00:19.787 --> 00:22.290
She's pretty, smart...

00:22.323 --> 00:23.324
Ask her out.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.725
Can't.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.394
She's too...

00:28.162 --> 00:30.131
Never mind.

00:30.164 --> 00:32.766
"Tell me who you love,
and I'll tell you who you are."

00:32.800 --> 00:34.502
The hell's that
supposed to mean?

00:34.535 --> 00:36.604
Creole proverb.
Means there's still hope

00:36.637 --> 00:38.306
for your dumb ass.

00:38.339 --> 00:39.607
How would you know?

00:39.640 --> 00:41.442
All you've ever loved
is that damn dog.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.644
Well, sure.
What's not to love?

00:45.713 --> 00:48.749
So... Savannah, huh?

00:50.451 --> 00:51.752
What?

00:51.785 --> 00:53.754
Nothing.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.789
It's stupid.
Come on.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.758
I'm your brother. Tell me.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.361
SAVANNAH:
What did you say?

01:00.394 --> 01:02.430
I can't.

01:02.463 --> 01:05.299
What?
I can't tell you.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.501
Tell me.

01:07.535 --> 01:10.504
Stop that.
Stop.
Oh. Mmm. Tell me

01:10.538 --> 01:13.541
what you said. No.
You better stop that.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.209
Tell me what you said
to Cade about me.
Savannah, stop.

01:15.243 --> 01:16.244
Come on.
Stop it. Stop.
Wait.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.511
Wait, wait, wait. Look, look.

01:17.545 --> 01:18.379
I got something for you.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.514
Do you?
Yeah.

01:20.548 --> 01:22.483
Top right drawer.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.631
Chris Lasalle, if you want me
to spend more time here,

01:37.665 --> 01:40.234
this girl's gonna need
more than an empty drawer.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.505
That can be arranged.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.685
It's Cade.

01:57.718 --> 02:00.421
But it's so late.

02:00.454 --> 02:05.393
Hey, brother. What's up?

02:16.504 --> 02:18.639
Baby brother.

02:21.209 --> 02:22.743
I'm in trouble.

02:22.776 --> 02:26.180
What's going on?

02:26.214 --> 02:28.449
You shouldn't have brought her.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.451
Cade, I'm just here
to help.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.920
A shrink's not
gonna fix this.

02:32.953 --> 02:36.624
Look, just tell us
what happened, all right?

02:36.657 --> 02:38.826
We're here
to help you out.

02:40.828 --> 02:43.431
Open the trunk.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.749
SAVANNAH:
It's okay.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.622
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

03:08.656 --> 03:11.459
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

03:11.492 --> 03:13.761
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

03:13.794 --> 03:15.263
* How, how, how, how

03:15.296 --> 03:17.631
* Hey, hey

03:23.471 --> 03:24.638
* You gotta come on.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.244
Her name's Windi Stewart.

03:30.278 --> 03:33.247
Cade's been dating her
for about a month now.

03:33.281 --> 03:34.648
PRIDE:
He claims to
have found her

03:34.682 --> 03:36.250
in his trunk?

03:36.284 --> 03:37.651
I know how this looks.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.253
You touch anything?

03:39.287 --> 03:41.422
Yeah, I opened the trunk.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.624
But, look, other than
the drinking tonight,

03:43.657 --> 03:45.359
Cade's been doing great.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.661
He's cleaned up.
He's got a new job.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.330
He's been going to
all his meetings.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.664
Even taking his
medication.

03:50.698 --> 03:51.965
But you shouldn't
have called me.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.567
You should've called NOPD.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.669
Look, he didn't do this.
All right, King?

03:55.703 --> 03:58.005
You got to believe me.
Someone's setting him up.

03:58.038 --> 04:02.343
You're too damn close, and
this is not our jurisdiction.

04:02.376 --> 04:03.811
There's NOPD.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.979
Detective Messier.
He's agreed to let you

04:06.013 --> 04:07.681
take Cade
to the station.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.883
Dwayne.
Jim.

04:16.390 --> 04:19.393
Bloody handprint
on the trunk latch of your car.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.529
Any chance
that's yours?

04:21.562 --> 04:24.598
I think I... touched
Windi when I found her.

04:24.632 --> 04:27.668
Maybe the latch, yeah.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.870
And what about these marks
on Windi's neck?

04:31.505 --> 04:33.040
Please take that away.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.642
I'm sorry.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.610
Photos are tough
to look at.

04:36.644 --> 04:37.745
Just one more.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.616
Recognize
this rope?

04:42.650 --> 04:44.485
No, I've never seen it before.

04:44.518 --> 04:47.455
See, that looks like blood
right there.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.956
Lab's gonna run it
for prints.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.492
Good. Then you'll see I
never touched that thing.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.427
Look, I wouldn't hurt her.

04:53.461 --> 04:55.095
So you guys,
you never argued,

04:55.128 --> 04:56.096
you never got into it?

04:56.129 --> 04:58.666
I didn't do this.

04:59.733 --> 05:00.968
Then who did?

05:01.001 --> 05:02.536
Bogeyman?

05:02.570 --> 05:04.538
I don't know. I...

05:04.572 --> 05:06.640
Okay, look,
there was this other guy...

05:06.674 --> 05:07.875
Oh, there's this other guy?

05:07.908 --> 05:09.477
Last night?

05:09.510 --> 05:10.811
No, of course not.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.381
Look, Windi was afraid, okay?

05:13.414 --> 05:15.649
She-she didn't feel safe
at her place.

05:15.683 --> 05:19.853
Something about this
other guy in her past.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.889
Windi give you his name?

05:23.991 --> 05:25.726
No.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.661
So some mystery man

05:27.695 --> 05:29.963
with no name who wasn't
actually there last night.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.966
And you really want us
to believe that you...?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.968
Minor offenses
and bipolar disorder

05:35.002 --> 05:36.770
doesn't add up to motive.

05:36.804 --> 05:37.971
He needs his
attorney in there.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.707
Waived his right.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.742
You should be thanking
your lucky stars

05:41.775 --> 05:43.411
you're not in there
for obstruction.

05:43.444 --> 05:46.380
Look, you heard him. All
right? There's another guy.

05:46.414 --> 05:48.416
Maybe you should be out there
looking for him.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.150
Christopher.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.719
Step outside.

06:01.795 --> 06:04.164
Apologies.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.133
If that was my brother,
I'd have shattered the glass

06:06.166 --> 06:07.868
and pulled him out of there
by now.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.673
We've known each other
a long time, Pride.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.442
This is a tough one.

06:14.475 --> 06:17.811
It'd be easier if you'd run
interference with the D.A.

06:17.845 --> 06:20.180
Help Cade make bail
if he gets charged.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.683
You have my guarantee
he won't leave the city.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.118
I'd be happy to oblige
under different circumstances,

06:25.152 --> 06:26.854
but this is a murder case.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.522
Then let us ride shotgun.

06:28.556 --> 06:31.792
Joint investigation?
Yeah, you lead.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.728
We review the evidence,
the body, talk to witnesses.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.129
Agreed.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.931
As long as
Agent Lasalle

06:37.965 --> 06:39.833
doesn't muddy the water.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.503
You have my word.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.137
Thank you.

06:44.171 --> 06:47.875
God, she's been
brutalized.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.010
No skin under the fingernails.

06:50.043 --> 06:52.012
No defensive wounds.

06:52.045 --> 06:55.015
Which suggests she
trusted her attacker.

06:55.048 --> 06:58.886
There's marks here and here.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.054
It's consistent
with being bound,

07:01.088 --> 07:03.023
and there's evidence
of rough sex.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.024
She may have been raped.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.626
Lab's running samples

07:05.659 --> 07:07.027
and the tox screen now.

07:07.060 --> 07:08.796
Cause of death?

07:08.829 --> 07:10.564
Mechanical asphyxia.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.733
The killer strangled her
with some sort of rope,

07:12.766 --> 07:14.735
and he pulled
it so hard

07:14.768 --> 07:17.971
it left these indentations here.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.106
What about the cut?

07:19.139 --> 07:21.141
It's from the necklace.

07:22.910 --> 07:26.780
The rope pushed
against the charm,

07:26.814 --> 07:28.782
causing it to slice
into her skin.

07:28.816 --> 07:31.218
Interesting charm.

07:31.251 --> 07:34.955
The symbol of
the voodoo goddess Erzulie.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.157
If your life is in disorder,

07:37.190 --> 07:38.792
you make an offering to her

07:38.826 --> 07:39.993
and she sets it right.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.663
Guess it's up to
us to do that.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.798
Deputies found this behind a
Dumpster at the crime scene.

07:44.832 --> 07:47.434
Give it here.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.507
BRODY:
Perfect match.

07:53.541 --> 07:54.675
Dust it for prints.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.644
I already did.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.145
BRODY:
And what'd you find?

08:03.751 --> 08:06.053
What the hell's
going on?
Messier?

08:06.086 --> 08:07.955
Lab confirmed
his prints are on the rope.

08:09.557 --> 08:10.924
Cade Lasalle,
you're under arrest

08:10.958 --> 08:12.926
for the murder of Windi Stewart.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.629
But I didn't do it.
Let's go.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.698
Hey, there's no way.
Someone's setting him up.
Christopher.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.600
Christopher, don't.
King, they got
the wrong guy.

08:19.633 --> 08:22.002
Messier, you got
the wrong guy! Hey!
Chris. Hey, hey. Hey, Chris.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.771
PRIDE: Chris.
CADE: Chris!

08:23.804 --> 08:25.906
Cade! I'll figure this out!
Don't worry!

08:25.939 --> 08:27.875
King, we gotta do something!
We will.

08:27.908 --> 08:28.942
But not like this.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.189
Great.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.591
Messier's boys are e-mailing

08:43.624 --> 08:45.225
the case files
and crime scene photos.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.160
Already coming in.
Where's Chris?

08:47.194 --> 08:49.196
Trying to get with Cade--
ask more about

08:49.229 --> 08:51.131
this guy Windi
was afraid of.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.935
Speak.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.236
No name, no
description.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.105
This guy pops up
out of nowhere

08:58.138 --> 09:00.073
after an hour
of questioning?

09:00.107 --> 09:01.742
Let NOPD play skeptic.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.811
Family's on the line
for murder here.

09:03.844 --> 09:08.015
Least we can do is offer them
another set of eyes.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.249
Okay.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.118
So what do we know?

09:11.151 --> 09:13.621
Windi was found
in Cade's car.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.122
She was strangled with a rope.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.624
Cade's prints are all over it.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.225
Add to that--
cursory exam suggests

09:18.258 --> 09:19.960
Windi knew her killer.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.162
Cade doesn't have an alibi.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.765
Everything about this
bolsters NOPD's case.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.299
None of it speaks to motive.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.669
Bipolar disorder,
issues with substance abuse.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.170
Cade shouldn't have
been in that bar.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.238
He shouldn't have
been drinking.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.173
But he's on meds.

09:33.206 --> 09:35.008
Maybe he had some kind of
psychotic break or something.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.243
Cade's version of crazy

09:36.276 --> 09:37.945
is painting
Chris's house

09:37.978 --> 09:39.346
like a Jackson Pollock.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.649
Since that night,
he's been going to group,

09:41.682 --> 09:43.283
he's been holding down
a construction job.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.318
No signs pointing
to this kind of violence.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.057
Agent Pride.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.193
Thank you.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.162
Windi's mom
agreed to a meet.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.130
Come with.

09:57.164 --> 10:00.000
Maybe she'll, uh,
shed some light

10:00.033 --> 10:02.235
on this guy that
Cade's talking about.

10:03.904 --> 10:06.273
WOMAN:
Windi was my joy.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.643
We are so sorry for
your loss, Ms. Stewart.

10:09.677 --> 10:11.278
I told the police
I had a feeling

10:11.311 --> 10:14.815
about that guy
they've got in custody.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.083
Cade.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.219
Windi brought him
by the house a few times,

10:19.252 --> 10:21.722
pretending to dote on her,

10:21.755 --> 10:25.759
acting all polite and nice.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.729
I didn't believe it.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.363
Why is that?

10:32.232 --> 10:34.768
I know his type.

10:34.802 --> 10:38.739
Windi didn't have
very good taste in men,

10:38.772 --> 10:40.340
just like her mama.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.175
PRIDE:
Let me ask this.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.944
Before Cade...

10:43.977 --> 10:45.345
were there others?

10:45.378 --> 10:47.748
Others?
PRIDE:
Other boyfriends

10:47.781 --> 10:51.218
that... Windi might have
been afraid of?

10:51.251 --> 10:53.253
Maybe.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.924
Some guy at work...

10:56.957 --> 10:59.459
in college...

10:59.492 --> 11:02.162
someone she met in a bar.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.463
Could you give us their names?

11:03.496 --> 11:06.033
So you can keep me
from finding out the truth?

11:06.066 --> 11:08.101
Cops told me

11:08.135 --> 11:10.037
Cade's related to one of you.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.338
Ms. Stewart...

11:11.371 --> 11:14.341
we want the same thing.

11:14.374 --> 11:17.477
We want justice
for your daughter.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.380
We just need to look
at every possibility.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.485
Steve Jackowski,
Windi's former fiancé.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.821
He threw a bottle
at her head

11:27.855 --> 11:29.322
after she broke up with him.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.792
Rap sheet?
Assault and petty theft.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.460
Then there's this Romeo.

11:33.493 --> 11:36.263
Joe Seibel, truck driver.
No direct threat,

11:36.296 --> 11:38.365
but he's got a rap sheet
for assault and battery.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.968
Windi's mom also mentioned
a college boyfriend.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.436
She thinks he's the
reason she dropped out.
She give you a name?

11:43.470 --> 11:46.006
Didn't know it. I called the
school; haven't heard back.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.307
Okay, the last thing
Cade remembers

11:47.340 --> 11:48.976
is meeting Windi
at the bar.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.844
So we take these photos
and show 'em around.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.445
All right.
Not we. Just Brody.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.748
Got something else for you.
Just talked to our ATF friend

11:54.782 --> 11:56.383
who's undercover with Baitfish.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.518
Baitfish?
Unrelated.
This other case

11:58.551 --> 12:01.121
has nothing to do with him--
or Sasha Broussard.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.389
Our friend has info

12:02.422 --> 12:04.357
on stolen guns
from a Navy base.

12:04.391 --> 12:05.793
You're putting me
on another case

12:05.826 --> 12:07.460
while my brother
sits in jail?

12:07.494 --> 12:09.096
I gave Messier my word
you wouldn't be involved.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.397
Like hell you did, King.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.299
If this was your brother...
I'd break rules.

12:12.332 --> 12:15.102
I would. But I can't
have you on this.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.104
I can't for
Cade's sake.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.806
This address, one hour.

12:18.839 --> 12:21.842
Meantime, Brody,
you go to the bar.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.311
I'll follow up
with Wade and Messier.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.358
You drinking a milk shake?

12:38.391 --> 12:40.460
Thought you went vegan.
Hemp milk.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.362
Lot of omega-3's.
Want some?

12:42.395 --> 12:43.396
No, thanks.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.298
So, what's this Navy case?

12:45.332 --> 12:47.367
That gang I'm dialed
into, 4th Street,

12:47.400 --> 12:51.805
they got a new venture--
stolen, top-of-the-line M9s,

12:51.839 --> 12:54.141
M16's, Navy issue.

12:54.174 --> 12:57.377
Gang starts using them,
Navy's got serious issues.

12:57.410 --> 13:00.313
Well, supplier's a petty officer
out of Belle Chasse.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.085
I heard about
your brother.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.420
I got family in prison.
It's tough.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.557
You trying to bond
with me, Percy.
I'm a realist.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.926
Want me to say a prayer,
give you false hope?

13:12.960 --> 13:14.995
It ends badly.
Then what?

13:16.563 --> 13:18.231
This Navy case,
what do you need?

13:18.265 --> 13:20.400
I take delivery for this gang

13:20.433 --> 13:22.202
tomorrow.

13:22.235 --> 13:25.405
I need you and your brain there
to help make an arrest.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.474
We will be.

13:27.507 --> 13:30.477
Wouldn't mind a few
surveillance pictures, too.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.245
Whatever you want.

13:32.279 --> 13:35.148
We're NCIS-- we multitask.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.550
WADE:
Windi's killer liked
to play games.

13:37.584 --> 13:41.554
Her over-distended
lungs present

13:41.588 --> 13:42.522
pulmonary edema.

13:42.555 --> 13:43.623
I've seen this often

13:43.656 --> 13:45.425
in victims of erotic asphyxia.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.526
One partner strangles the other

13:46.559 --> 13:48.161
to the point of passing out.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.462
Right. The depletion of oxygen

13:49.496 --> 13:51.464
brings about a euphoric state.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.501
And in Windi's case...
she died.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.303
So...

13:56.336 --> 13:58.505
sex game gone wrong.

13:58.538 --> 14:01.308
WADE: Given the damage
inflicted on this girl,

14:01.341 --> 14:03.310
I doubt she was a
willing participant.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.612
Lab results are inconclusive

14:05.645 --> 14:07.580
for trace and DNA
off of Windi's body.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.449
It's been great seeing everyone.
Have a nice day.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.318
Lund.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.253
What about
the tox results?

14:15.188 --> 14:19.092
Uh, both Cade and Windi had
blood alcohol levels above .14.

14:19.126 --> 14:20.560
Uh, Windi was clean for drugs.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.429
Cade tested positive
for oxcarbazepine.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.631
That's a treatment
for bipolar disorder.

14:24.664 --> 14:28.001
Added with alcohol, would that
explain Cade's memory loss?

14:28.035 --> 14:29.436
Yep. See you.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.404
Wait.

14:31.438 --> 14:35.909
Could the combo platter
also cause anger, rage?

14:35.943 --> 14:37.677
I'm sorry,
what's your question?

14:37.710 --> 14:42.415
Could Cade's intoxicated state
inspire him to strangle Windi?

14:43.483 --> 14:45.118
WADE:
Sebastian,

14:45.152 --> 14:47.287
we're all just
doing our jobs.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.256
Yeah, well, mine sucks, okay?
Lasalle's gonna hate me.

14:49.289 --> 14:50.690
It's all right, Sebastian.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.692
SEBASTIAN:
Uh...

14:52.725 --> 14:54.962
The med itself has
intense side effects.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.597
Uh, when combined
with alcohol,

14:57.630 --> 14:59.566
yes, it could cause
violent behavior.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.603
Cade didn't need a motive.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.672
Meds may have done this for him.

15:05.705 --> 15:08.441
We got some leads we still
want to keep pursuing.

15:08.475 --> 15:11.444
Be my guest, but I have to say,

15:11.478 --> 15:13.646
I think you're chasing ghosts.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.351
MAN:
Cops already asked.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.020
Told 'em I didn't
see these guys.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.455
What about them?

15:22.489 --> 15:25.225
Yeah, they were here.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.961
Something was definitely
off with him.
What do you mean?

15:27.995 --> 15:29.963
Came in wanting to order
a grapefruit juice,

15:29.997 --> 15:31.564
and then starts
pounding drinks.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.200
Did he seem upset?

15:33.233 --> 15:35.535
No, but he was acting
weird with her.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.537
And the way he was
holding her by the elbow,

15:37.570 --> 15:38.638
and scared look
in her eyes.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.543
Sorry. Thanks.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.578
LASALLE :
Hey, Brody, I've got something.
Lasalle?

15:45.612 --> 15:47.414
Cops aren't loo... right place.
I-I can't hear you.

15:47.447 --> 15:48.415
There's too much static.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.050
I'm at Windi's apart...

15:50.083 --> 15:50.984
You're where?

15:53.220 --> 15:55.155
You broke into Windi's
apartment to search it?

15:55.188 --> 15:56.756
I was thinking about
what my brother said.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.525
Windi's scared to be
in her own place.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.127
Lasalle, this is
the victim's apartment.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.229
Your brother is
a prime suspect in her murder.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.230
Was, okay?

16:03.263 --> 16:05.232
Was a prime suspect.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.634
Look at the new bling
on the door and windows.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.570
BRODY: Deadbolts,
bars on the windows.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.572
But NOPD called me,

16:12.605 --> 16:14.607
and Jackowski
and Seibel alibied out.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.343
Well, it must be that guy
from Windi's college

16:16.376 --> 16:17.710
her mom talked about.
I called the school.

16:17.744 --> 16:20.180
Couldn't get
an answer.
Try again.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.519
Too much static.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.423
There was static when I
called you from here, too.

16:30.457 --> 16:32.492
Call me.

16:34.694 --> 16:37.297
Let's move around.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.434
You think the interference
is caused by a bug?

16:41.468 --> 16:42.769
Yeah. Stronger
in this room.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.471
Keep going.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.640
Somewhere over here.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.709
Stop.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.756
It's not a bug.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.458
It's a camera.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.727
Looks like Windi had
a secret admirer.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.596
Cade was right.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.564
There is someone else.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.346
Hey, got your message.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.448
What the hell is going on?
I told you...

17:28.481 --> 17:30.450
Hang on. Hang on.
Just listen.

17:30.483 --> 17:31.551
Someone's spying
on Windi.

17:31.584 --> 17:32.785
Tracked the serial number

17:32.819 --> 17:34.687
on the smoke alarm camera
to a spy shop.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.289
Owner gave up the name.

17:36.323 --> 17:37.457
Reid Gorie,
serial stalker.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.092
Two stints in
sex rehab,

17:39.126 --> 17:40.593
restraining order
by an ex-girlfriend,

17:40.627 --> 17:42.562
and he went to the
same college as Windi.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.164
Lives in that house
up there.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.798
Look, Gorie
stalks Windi,

17:45.832 --> 17:49.202
gets jealous of Cade,
kills her and sets him up.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.838
You got it all figured out.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.873
I told you to lay low.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.542
Look, this camera's
solid evidence.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.610
Which isn't admissible
because of your illegal search.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.212
King, uh, I'm telling...

17:59.246 --> 18:00.213
Go back to the car.

18:00.247 --> 18:01.248
Look, just let me...

18:01.281 --> 18:02.315
Go back to the car.

18:02.349 --> 18:03.450
Stay there.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.220
This guy's got motive.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.793
You should have
called me

18:13.826 --> 18:15.695
the second you knew
he was in that apartment.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.697
I know. I'm sorry.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.700
You still want to do this even
though nothing's admissible?

18:20.733 --> 18:22.702
We're here.

18:22.735 --> 18:25.438
Let's see if Mr. Gorie says
something that is.

18:26.906 --> 18:29.209
MAN: I've been expecting you
since I saw you

18:29.242 --> 18:30.643
in Windi's apartment.

18:30.677 --> 18:33.413
Camera loves you, Agent Brody.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.183
Where were you last night
around 11:00 p.m., Mr. Gorie?

18:36.216 --> 18:38.185
Bachelor auction.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.387
I was the handsome guy
in the tux.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.688
Where'd you get that scratch?

18:43.456 --> 18:45.425
You know what, I thought
about calling my attorney,

18:45.458 --> 18:48.195
but then that would be
a waste of all our time.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.496
I didn't kill Windi.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.198
You just liked to watch.

18:51.231 --> 18:54.234
I was protecting her
from her bad choices in men.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.537
Like Cade Lasalle.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.939
The guy's a violent
lowlife.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.441
He's got a rap sheet.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.843
His own brother put him
in a psych lock-up.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.678
You've done your homework.
Here.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.480
If you don't
believe me,

19:07.514 --> 19:09.282
take this.

19:09.316 --> 19:10.483
What is it?

19:10.517 --> 19:14.554
Proof Cade Lasalle
murdered Windi.

19:38.445 --> 19:40.680
Cade say anything
to you about this?

19:43.816 --> 19:45.785
Chris?

19:45.818 --> 19:47.820
Cade said they never argued.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.525
This has to be doctored.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.361
Gorie's done
something to it.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.828
Talked to the owners at
the bachelor auction.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.964
So far, no one remembers
Gorie being there.

19:57.997 --> 19:59.799
That's 'cause he was
busy killing Windi.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.401
Let's get this to Sebastian.

20:01.434 --> 20:02.502
Bring NOPD in.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.903
You can't help here.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.538
King.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.440
You know me.
You know how I work.

20:07.474 --> 20:10.643
Even though every
bone in my body

20:10.677 --> 20:13.480
says Cade didn't do this,

20:13.513 --> 20:15.214
I don't speak for him.

20:17.384 --> 20:20.287
I don't speak for NOPD

20:20.320 --> 20:22.522
or NCIS, all right?

20:22.555 --> 20:25.592
I speak for that
dead girl, Windi.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.796
More than anyone,
I want justice for her.

20:31.798 --> 20:35.535
Best way to help both of them
is for you to stay away.

20:37.404 --> 20:40.373
What's going on
with the Navy case?

20:40.407 --> 20:42.375
Sonja's picking me up
in a couple hours.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.377
We're going to do
recon for the gun buy.

20:44.411 --> 20:45.612
Go home.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.314
Wait for her there.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.415
Chris.

20:49.982 --> 20:52.519
Be in touch with you later.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.595
Get this to Sebastian,

21:02.629 --> 21:04.531
see what he can find.

21:04.564 --> 21:05.965
I'll talk to Cade.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.668
PRIDE:
Why'd you lie to the cops?

21:14.741 --> 21:17.009
Windi was dead
in my car.

21:17.043 --> 21:19.712
I'm gonna tell them I got
in an argument with her?

21:21.881 --> 21:23.850
Tell me.

21:23.883 --> 21:27.487
Windi was upset about the guy
that was bothering her.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.356
I wanted her
to tell me his name.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.557
She wouldn't.

21:30.590 --> 21:31.991
You saying you were jealous?

21:32.024 --> 21:33.726
I wanted to help her.

21:35.428 --> 21:36.829
We ended up
getting into it,

21:36.863 --> 21:39.532
but I called her later
and told her I was sorry.

21:44.371 --> 21:45.572
You ever see him?

21:45.605 --> 21:48.641
Reid Gorie?

21:48.675 --> 21:49.876
No.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.411
Maybe at the bar.

21:51.444 --> 21:53.413
Outside of it.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.548
Cade, try to remember.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.116
I can't.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.951
Okay, I messed up.

21:58.985 --> 22:02.622
I had a few drinks,
I woke up, and she was dead.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.459
And I keep asking myself,

22:06.493 --> 22:08.728
"Did I do this?

22:08.761 --> 22:12.599
Am I so gone that
I actually killed Windi?"

22:12.632 --> 22:14.667
Christopher doesn't think so.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.007
He told me you saved him.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.076
Back when he quit Vice.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.979
When he was all
low and angry.

22:27.013 --> 22:30.517
You're kind of like
the dad he never had.

22:32.585 --> 22:35.622
It's my understanding that, uh,

22:35.655 --> 22:38.391
you carried some of that weight.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.631
We'll figure this out.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.666
Understood?

22:52.605 --> 22:54.574
SAVANNAH:
The detectives called me.

22:54.607 --> 22:56.075
They asked for Cade's
psych records.

22:56.108 --> 22:58.010
Told them to get a subpoena.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.746
Sorry you're involved in this.

22:59.779 --> 23:01.448
You know, when I let you

23:01.481 --> 23:02.749
cheat off my papers
in high school,

23:02.782 --> 23:05.184
I had no idea
what I was getting into.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.019
You didn't even know I existed.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.655
What-- cute guy
with the big ears?

23:08.688 --> 23:09.756
I knew you were back there.

23:12.792 --> 23:14.794
Is that your other girlfriend?

23:16.529 --> 23:18.498
It's the other case
Pride's got me on.

23:19.932 --> 23:21.568
Well...

23:21.601 --> 23:23.636
when you're done, then.

23:25.838 --> 23:27.774
So, what's up
with the Little Mermaid?

23:27.807 --> 23:28.908
Excuse me?

23:28.941 --> 23:30.677
Oh, red hair-- Little Mermaid.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.645
Her name's Savannah.

23:32.679 --> 23:34.747
Ah.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.749
They find something else
on your brother?

23:36.783 --> 23:38.150
Empathize much?

23:38.184 --> 23:40.520
That's what mermaids are for.

23:40.553 --> 23:41.654
There's seriously
something wrong with you.

23:41.688 --> 23:43.155
Like I said,

23:43.189 --> 23:45.124
I've been down this road,
and I've learned.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.826
Keep your distance, kid.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.461
It's better that way.

23:49.829 --> 23:52.064
So, this gun deal--
what's the timeline?

23:52.098 --> 23:54.734
Navy guy arrives
tomorrow at noon.

23:54.767 --> 23:58.671
Buy is 10K for a couple
untraceable M9's and M16's.

23:58.705 --> 24:01.574
I figure you get
your camera set up here,

24:01.608 --> 24:03.676
you'll stay hidden
from view.

24:03.710 --> 24:07.213
Yeah, crouched down in
a pile of pigeon poop.

24:07.246 --> 24:08.848
Where exactly is
it taking place?

24:08.881 --> 24:10.883
Oh, the loading dock
over there.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.885
That's quite a
distance from here.

24:12.919 --> 24:14.687
What if I have to run
interference?

24:14.721 --> 24:16.689
Well, use your worldly charms.

24:16.723 --> 24:19.559
I don't have much
of that right now.

24:19.592 --> 24:22.662
Aw, I bet the Little Mermaid
would beg to differ.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.836
What's all this?

24:29.869 --> 24:31.538
The grassy knoll.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.606
These guys represent
the bystanders that were there

24:33.640 --> 24:34.874
when Kennedy's limo drove by.

24:34.907 --> 24:35.708
Relevance?

24:35.742 --> 24:37.209
The Zapruder film.

24:37.243 --> 24:38.244
In it, the bystanders
on the lawn

24:38.277 --> 24:39.712
don't look at the limo

24:39.746 --> 24:41.180
after Kennedy is shot.
Instead...

24:41.213 --> 24:43.616
they look beyond it.
Meaning that the background

24:43.650 --> 24:45.017
was out of synch
with the main action.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.086
You're saying the
Zapruder film was altered.

24:47.119 --> 24:49.121
Yeah, so was yours, just not in
the way that Lasalle thought.

24:49.155 --> 24:51.824
So, I isolated
the background action

24:51.858 --> 24:54.994
from the main action on
the flash drive Gorie gave you.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.564
Okay, you see the shadow from
the sun on the living room wall?

24:57.597 --> 24:58.965
Watch this.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.834
And... Oliver Stone!

25:01.868 --> 25:03.202
Shadow skipped.
Yeah.

25:03.235 --> 25:04.671
Given where the
sun rose and set

25:04.704 --> 25:06.105
on this manufactured day,

25:06.138 --> 25:08.307
I'd guess that maybe
three hours are missing.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.577
Gorie pulled the flash drive
right out of his laptop.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.178
The missing footage could still
be on the laptop's hard drive.

25:12.211 --> 25:14.581
I'll get a judge.
I'll call Pride.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.291
Federal agents, Mr. Gorie.

25:25.324 --> 25:26.759
Open up!

25:26.793 --> 25:29.195
We've got a warrant, Mr. Gorie.

25:30.229 --> 25:31.931
We'll go around back.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.166
He's running!

25:38.270 --> 25:40.506
Gorie, stop!
He's got the laptop!

26:01.193 --> 26:02.161
You all right?

26:02.194 --> 26:03.262
Got it.
Computer!

26:34.226 --> 26:36.262
Captain, they only have
this video because

26:36.295 --> 26:39.999
Agent Lasalle illegally
searched Windi's apartment.

26:40.032 --> 26:43.102
Mr. Gorie, all I know is
my office got an anonymous tip

26:43.135 --> 26:45.071
about an illegal camera
in there.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.073
The lab tracked the signal
to your laptop.

26:47.106 --> 26:49.942
We were in the area.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.944
This is collusion.

26:52.979 --> 26:54.113
It's obsession.

26:54.146 --> 26:57.083
Yours.

26:57.116 --> 26:59.752
BRODY:
Footage you left off
the flash drive you gave us.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.053
Showtime.

27:01.087 --> 27:03.155
Look at you-- in
Windi's apartment

27:03.189 --> 27:04.891
after Cade left.

27:04.924 --> 27:07.794
How you got
that scratch.

27:12.031 --> 27:13.933
Watching her wasn't enough.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.735
You had to see her.

27:15.768 --> 27:17.036
Touch her.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.938
And when she refused you,

27:18.971 --> 27:20.439
you killed her.
She was alone.

27:20.472 --> 27:23.242
Why didn't I just
kill her right there?

27:23.275 --> 27:25.144
Maybe you wanted Cade Lasalle
to take the fall.

27:25.177 --> 27:26.245
Strangled her.

27:26.278 --> 27:28.180
Put the rope in his hands.

27:33.953 --> 27:36.455
Cade did this.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.258
I bet you he's
even done it before.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.392
You would know.

27:40.426 --> 27:41.961
Stalking other girls...

27:41.994 --> 27:44.030
I went to rehab
for-for my issues.

27:44.063 --> 27:46.198
You raped and tortured Windi
because of your issues.

27:46.232 --> 27:47.700
No alibi, Gorie!

27:47.734 --> 27:50.102
No one saw you
at that auction!

27:54.106 --> 27:56.943
I was across the street

27:56.976 --> 28:00.012
from her apartment
all night,

28:00.046 --> 28:02.849
waiting for her to come back.

28:02.882 --> 28:05.284
And she never did.

28:12.224 --> 28:15.261
BRODY:
Surveillance from a street cam
outside Windi's apartment.

28:15.294 --> 28:16.495
Taken during Windi's
time of death.

28:16.528 --> 28:17.897
Guy's a psycho.

28:17.930 --> 28:20.166
Psycho with an alibi.

28:20.199 --> 28:22.101
Anything from your side?

28:22.134 --> 28:23.369
Where we started.

28:23.402 --> 28:25.104
As is the evidence.

28:25.137 --> 28:26.773
So, that's it?

28:26.806 --> 28:28.775
We all wanted
a different outcome here.

28:28.808 --> 28:31.243
With all due respect,
we got to stop digging.

28:31.277 --> 28:33.245
For Lasalle's sake
and for Windi's family.

28:36.015 --> 28:38.417
Didn't matter what Gorie said--
his mind is set.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.386
Just like yours.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.789
About Cade.

28:42.822 --> 28:43.790
But not anymore?

28:43.823 --> 28:45.825
Gorie was a stalker.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.293
He went to sex rehab.

28:47.326 --> 28:48.427
He likes playing games.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.129
He fits this. Cade doesn't.

28:50.162 --> 28:52.131
If the theory is he
snapped, probably not.

28:52.164 --> 28:53.465
What did Cade say
when he talked to you?

28:53.499 --> 28:55.334
Just...

28:55.367 --> 28:58.070
just that he didn't remember.

28:59.471 --> 29:01.473
Come on, Brody.

29:01.507 --> 29:05.211
What if whoever did this
was like Gorie?

29:05.244 --> 29:07.179
Calculating, ruthless.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.015
Made Cade black out somehow.

29:09.048 --> 29:10.149
Tied up Windi.

29:10.182 --> 29:11.217
Killed her.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.018
Dumped the car.

29:12.051 --> 29:14.153
Setting Cade up
for the whole thing.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.487
Takes planning, experience.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.489
I doubt it was the first time.

29:17.523 --> 29:19.358
So, go back through everything.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.060
Everything. Fine-tooth comb.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.862
All we got on this case.

29:22.895 --> 29:24.330
I'll call Loretta,

29:24.363 --> 29:26.165
tell her to do the same
thing on her end.

29:26.198 --> 29:28.100
All right.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.237
LASALLE:
Suspect on my brother's case

29:31.270 --> 29:34.073
alibied out.
Back to square one.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.241
Looking for more suspects.

29:35.274 --> 29:36.542
Other than your brother.

29:36.575 --> 29:37.576
He didn't do this.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.812
How are you so sure?

29:44.250 --> 29:46.352
This one summer...

29:46.385 --> 29:48.955
before Cade got sick,

29:48.988 --> 29:50.556
he found this dog
that was boarded up...

29:50.589 --> 29:53.025
Story time?
...but he saved it.

29:53.059 --> 29:55.227
All right? A broken
piece of misery

29:55.261 --> 29:58.364
that everyone thought
should just be put down.

29:58.397 --> 29:59.398
Cade felt otherwise.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.133
Nursed it back to health.

30:02.969 --> 30:06.238
And he loved that dog
when no one else would.

30:06.272 --> 30:09.208
Is that the kind of kid

30:09.241 --> 30:11.410
that grows up to
murder someone?

30:13.145 --> 30:14.413
I don't know.

30:14.446 --> 30:16.215
I like cats.

30:16.248 --> 30:18.350
What?
Listen.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.920
Lasalle, I'm not
your shrink, okay?

30:20.953 --> 30:24.156
But, um... it was a nice story.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.325
Now, look out.
He's here.

30:26.358 --> 30:27.459
Are we good, though?

30:27.493 --> 30:29.228
I mean, you need a hug
or something?

30:29.261 --> 30:30.396
'Cause I feel like...
Fine. I'm okay.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.398
All right, good.
Yeah. Thank you.

30:37.937 --> 30:40.606
Cats.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.515
Lyons, you're late.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.150
90-series M9.

30:51.183 --> 30:54.386
Official sidearm of
the U.S. military.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.422
Want to see the action?
Hang on.

30:58.024 --> 30:59.258
Sure.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.160
You buy in the next
five minutes,

31:01.193 --> 31:02.328
I'll throw in the silencer.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.930
The hell is this

31:03.963 --> 31:05.197
It's 10K.

31:05.231 --> 31:06.398
We got a deal?

31:08.935 --> 31:10.937
Yo! What the hell
is your problem?

31:10.970 --> 31:12.438
This all the cash you got?

31:12.471 --> 31:14.440
You robbing me?

31:14.473 --> 31:16.308
Wait till I tell the
players at 4th Street

31:16.342 --> 31:18.410
their supplier's a thief.

31:18.444 --> 31:20.246
Why don't we tell
them together? NCIS!

31:20.279 --> 31:24.416
Get your hands up.

31:24.450 --> 31:26.285
"NCIS"

31:26.318 --> 31:28.387
Naval Criminal
Investigative Service.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.489
LASALLE:
Now, lovebirds!

31:46.238 --> 31:49.408
Navy guy's headed
for base lockup.

31:49.441 --> 31:52.444
I'll send you the
surveillance photos.

31:52.478 --> 31:54.580
Thanks.

31:54.613 --> 31:56.648
For having my back.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.650
Ah, no problem.

31:58.684 --> 32:01.520
And I hope everything
works out for your brother.

32:02.989 --> 32:04.490
I'll say some prayers.

32:04.523 --> 32:06.492
You going soft on me, Percy?

32:06.525 --> 32:08.494
Nah.

32:08.527 --> 32:11.964
Just 'cause mine weren't
answered doesn't mean

32:11.998 --> 32:14.566
your brother shouldn't get
a little divine intervention.

32:51.037 --> 32:52.504
Nothing there.

33:03.449 --> 33:06.452
That is not your necklace.

33:07.819 --> 33:10.456
The killer put it on her?

33:10.489 --> 33:12.458
Yes, I think as some kind
of sick message or ritual.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.193
And you were right,
there were others.

33:14.226 --> 33:15.794
Cops didn't get anything
because the necklaces

33:15.827 --> 33:17.663
were catalogued
as personal items.

33:17.696 --> 33:19.465
How many cases?

33:19.498 --> 33:22.201
Three victims were raped
and strangled with a rope.

33:22.234 --> 33:23.569
Most recent case--
Laura Anderson.

33:23.602 --> 33:25.437
No suspects,
but there's a witness

33:25.471 --> 33:27.039
and she lives close.

33:27.073 --> 33:29.541
907 Moss Hill Road.

33:29.575 --> 33:31.177
All right, go.
Learn things.

33:31.210 --> 33:32.444
King. Deal's done.

33:32.478 --> 33:33.479
Suspects in custody,

33:33.512 --> 33:35.447
and Sonja took
the guns to ATF.

33:35.481 --> 33:37.683
Lasalle!

33:37.716 --> 33:39.585
Excuse his enthusiasm.

33:39.618 --> 33:41.187
What's going on?

33:41.220 --> 33:42.454
Dr. Wade
and I went rogue.

33:42.488 --> 33:44.723
Like minds, Pride.

33:44.756 --> 33:47.659
I was reviewing Cade's
tox report when you called.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.428
Oxcar and alcohol

33:49.461 --> 33:52.364
could explain
a three-hour blackout.

33:52.398 --> 33:54.600
The time between the bar
and when he called me?

33:54.633 --> 33:56.568
Yes. However,
blackouts are porous,

33:56.602 --> 33:59.771
and over time, people begin
to remember missing pieces.

33:59.805 --> 34:01.840
But Cade insists that
he doesn't remember anything.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.842
Yeah, so we ran a tox
on Cade's blood.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.477
I thought you already did that.
Well, we did,

34:05.511 --> 34:07.379
but NOPD requested
the standard report.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.248
But for roofies, you have to do
a whole separate test.

34:09.281 --> 34:10.449
Cade was roofied?

34:10.482 --> 34:13.385
Yeah. Flunitrazepam.
At least two milligrams.

34:13.419 --> 34:14.753
PRIDE:
How incapacitated
would that make him?

34:14.786 --> 34:16.455
You ever see
that episode of Star Trek

34:16.488 --> 34:17.789
when Kirk gets tanked up
on Saurian Brandy?

34:18.757 --> 34:20.426
Try again.

34:20.459 --> 34:21.627
Yeah, uh... flunitrazepam

34:21.660 --> 34:23.595
is ten times more potent
than diazepam.

34:23.629 --> 34:24.630
There was enough inside of Cade

34:24.663 --> 34:26.465
to impair him
for five to six hours

34:26.498 --> 34:28.100
and cause the memory loss.

34:28.134 --> 34:29.635
Lasalle, Cade wouldn't have had

34:29.668 --> 34:30.736
the strength to strangle Windi.

34:33.605 --> 34:34.740
Thank you, bud.

34:34.773 --> 34:36.542
Always here for you, bro.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.244
Should we fist

34:38.277 --> 34:39.745
Nah, I'm good.
Yeah, I'm good, too.

34:39.778 --> 34:42.614
Right, so Cade's memory stops
right after he left the bar.

34:42.648 --> 34:46.485
Yeah, the bartender told Brody
that Cade and Windi sat alone.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.820
And he's the one
that pours the drinks.

34:48.854 --> 34:50.856
Name and address.

34:50.889 --> 34:53.559
Kai Bryant.
907 Moss Hill Road.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.727
Where?
907 Moss Hill Road.

34:55.761 --> 34:57.229
Brody.

35:04.236 --> 35:05.704
NCIS.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.239
WOMAN:
Come on in.

35:10.876 --> 35:13.445
NCIS Special Agent
Meredith Brody.

35:13.479 --> 35:14.846
I'm looking for Eloise Sanchez.

35:14.880 --> 35:16.882
You got her.
What can I do you for?

35:16.915 --> 35:18.917
I'm here in regards to
the Laura Anderson case.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.752
It's been a while.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.722
Y'all still investigating that?

35:27.559 --> 35:29.395
You live here alone,
Ms. Sanchez?

35:29.428 --> 35:30.562
ELOISE:
Nah.

35:30.596 --> 35:31.597
The doctors say it's no good

35:31.630 --> 35:33.532
for me to be by myself.

35:33.565 --> 35:35.434
Why don't you stay?

35:37.236 --> 35:39.805
Keep her company?

35:51.950 --> 35:54.253
Shouldn't have come here, bitch.

35:54.286 --> 35:55.487
Cops know I'm here.

35:55.521 --> 35:56.755
They're on the way.

35:56.788 --> 35:58.524
Well, that don't matter.

36:00.959 --> 36:02.594
BRODY:
Homey.

36:02.628 --> 36:03.862
ELOISE:
Shut up.

36:11.570 --> 36:12.704
On your knees.

36:24.383 --> 36:26.918
This all part
of your little game?

36:26.952 --> 36:29.655
This is what you did
with the others, isn't it?

36:31.022 --> 36:32.724
Windi Stewart, Laura Anderson--

36:32.758 --> 36:34.493
you

36:34.526 --> 36:35.761
You could say that.

36:35.794 --> 36:37.195
Couldn't you, sweetheart?

36:41.900 --> 36:43.335
He finds them...

36:43.369 --> 36:45.271
I adorn them.

36:45.304 --> 36:47.839
Teamwork.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.741
Which one of you gets off
on strangling them?

36:51.277 --> 36:52.344
The bartender, Bryant,

36:52.378 --> 36:53.579
doesn't have a record,

36:53.612 --> 36:55.281
but his girlfriend

36:55.314 --> 36:56.815
did a stint
in a juvie psych ward.

36:56.848 --> 36:59.518
Seems she gets off
on watching things die.

36:59.551 --> 37:00.786
Let me guess.

37:00.819 --> 37:01.853
To calm her nerves.

37:01.887 --> 37:04.556
She prays to the... Erzulie.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.860
You really buy into her crap?

37:10.929 --> 37:11.997
I love her.

37:12.030 --> 37:14.700
Sure.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.302
What's not to love?

37:32.318 --> 37:33.719
Anything?

37:33.752 --> 37:35.487
No. Brody's not answering.

37:53.905 --> 37:54.940
Brody.

37:54.973 --> 37:56.408
Take the back.

38:11.089 --> 38:14.660
Let's get you out of here.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.695
*

38:26.071 --> 38:30.909
* Honey, honey up in the trees

38:30.942 --> 38:35.914
* Fields of flowers
deep in his dreams *

38:35.947 --> 38:40.118
* Lead them out to sea
by the east *

38:40.151 --> 38:42.821
* Honey, honey,
food for the bees *

38:42.854 --> 38:45.457
Windi said
that you were good to her.

38:46.992 --> 38:48.994
I just didn't want
to believe it.

38:53.031 --> 38:55.834
Thank you for being kind
to my girl.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.372
I'll miss her, too.

39:02.541 --> 39:06.712
* Honey, honey, out on the sea

39:06.745 --> 39:11.082
* In the doldrums
thinking of me *

39:11.116 --> 39:13.852
Hardest thing ever.

39:13.885 --> 39:16.154
Thanks for sticking
by me, Chris.

39:16.187 --> 39:18.023
Any time, brother.

39:18.056 --> 39:19.958
Let's go home.

39:19.991 --> 39:21.126
I'm not going home with you.

39:21.159 --> 39:23.462
What do you mean?

39:23.495 --> 39:25.697
After all this...

39:25.731 --> 39:27.499
I want to see Mom.

39:27.533 --> 39:30.001
And you need to spend time
with your lady.

39:31.903 --> 39:33.905
Savannah is cooking dinner
for us.

39:35.507 --> 39:36.975
Don't get me wrong,
she's cute and all,

39:37.008 --> 39:38.610
but Mom's a better cook.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.513
True.

39:43.449 --> 39:47.018
Remember what you said about her
at the lake, way back when?

39:47.052 --> 39:49.054
Had that goofy grin
smothering your face?

39:50.722 --> 39:53.992
I'm gonna marry her,
Cade, someday.

39:54.025 --> 39:56.762
I'm gonna marry
Savannah.

39:56.795 --> 39:58.897
You still remember that?
Hey.

39:58.930 --> 40:01.066
That was the best summer
of my life.

40:01.099 --> 40:03.669
Me, my dog, Alabama sun...

40:03.702 --> 40:04.970
my little brother,

40:05.003 --> 40:06.872
blissfully lost in love.

40:12.944 --> 40:17.616
* Honey, honey, out on the sea

40:17.649 --> 40:21.787
* In the doldrums
waiting for me... *

40:23.589 --> 40:25.624
Glad it worked out
for Lasalle and his brother.

40:25.657 --> 40:27.593
Little faith
goes a long way.

40:27.626 --> 40:29.928
I guess for
some people it can.

40:29.961 --> 40:31.897
Yours is about
to pay off.

40:33.131 --> 40:36.201
Baitfish?

40:36.234 --> 40:37.803
Where is he?

40:37.836 --> 40:39.771
Don't know, but he did
call to thank me

40:39.805 --> 40:41.006
for delivering his drugs

40:41.039 --> 40:44.175
and wants me around
for his next venture.

40:44.209 --> 40:46.512
Something connected
to Sasha Broussard?

40:46.545 --> 40:47.946
Maybe, maybe not,

40:47.979 --> 40:49.848
but I got the vibe
he's planning a hit.

40:49.881 --> 40:51.116
Target?

40:51.149 --> 40:52.250
Someone in town.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.620
Still trying
to figure out who.

40:54.653 --> 40:56.855
*

41:00.926 --> 41:05.997
* Honey, honey, out on the sea

41:06.031 --> 41:10.636
* In the doldrums
waiting for me *

41:10.669 --> 41:14.806
* Me in my boat
searching for he *

41:14.840 --> 41:18.143
* Honey, honey,
food for the bees. *

41:18.176 --> 41:19.845
Chris?

41:19.878 --> 41:21.246
That was fast.

41:28.754 --> 41:31.022
Oh, God.

41:31.056 --> 41:33.759
Where is Lasalle?

41:33.792 --> 41:36.995
I need to get a message
to his boss.

41:37.028 --> 41:39.998
I don't know.

41:40.031 --> 41:42.133
I swear.

41:48.807 --> 41:51.209
No worries.

41:57.315 --> 41:59.217
You'll do.
