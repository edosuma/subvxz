00:48.214 --> 00:51.843
Ladies and gentlemen, Chris Rock.

01:12.822 --> 01:13.740
Yeah.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.452
Please.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.120
Oh, sit down.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.666
Sit yo asses down.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.378
Please let me get on with the show.

01:27.837 --> 01:29.756
It's nice to be here.

01:30.298 --> 01:31.257
Brooklyn.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.053
Here's my question.

01:35.428 --> 01:36.638
You would think...

01:37.097 --> 01:38.264
You would think...

01:38.348 --> 01:42.310
You would think the cops would
occasionally shoot a white kid...

01:42.811 --> 01:44.813
just to make it look good.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.608
You would think that
every couple of months

01:48.691 --> 01:51.736
they'd look at their dead nigga calender
and go...

01:53.071 --> 01:55.281
"Oh, my God, we're up to 16.

01:55.907 --> 01:57.909
We gotta shoot a white kid quick."

01:58.743 --> 02:02.580
"Uh, which one?" "The first one you see
singing Cardi B."

02:06.709 --> 02:10.380
That's right. I mean, honestly, I wanna
live in a world...

02:10.964 --> 02:12.632
with real equality.

02:13.007 --> 02:14.717
I wanna live in a world...

02:15.009 --> 02:18.763
where an equal amount of white kids
are shot every month.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.808
An equal world.

02:21.975 --> 02:26.479
I wanna see white mothers
on TV crying.

02:28.064 --> 02:30.608
Standing next to Al Sharpton.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.947
Talking about, "We need justice for Chad.

02:37.532 --> 02:40.034
We need justice for Chad.

02:40.535 --> 02:44.122
He was just coming home
from racquetball practice."

02:47.250 --> 02:49.377
I know some people like,
"Come on, Chris, man.

02:49.460 --> 02:51.462
You go too hard on the cops, man.

02:51.546 --> 02:52.672
You're a celebrity.

02:53.006 --> 02:56.342
I'm sure they let you go. I'm sure they're
nice to you, man. You a celebrity."

02:56.843 --> 02:58.928
Yeah, I'm famous, you know.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.764
But I'm not, like,
Michael Jackson, famous.

03:02.056 --> 03:04.517
I'm not famous from miles away.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.150
Like, my fame kicks in right about here.

03:14.319 --> 03:17.197
You know? When the cops see me
walking down the street,

03:17.280 --> 03:19.782
they're like, "Nigga, nigga,
nigga, nigga, nigga...

03:20.200 --> 03:22.202
Hey, that's Chris Rock!

03:24.621 --> 03:28.041
Man, you are funny, man.
I love  Pootie Tang,  man."

03:32.795 --> 03:34.797
It's weird, man. It's weird.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.342
You know, this whole thing
with the cops, man, 'cause...

03:37.467 --> 03:41.137
You know, as a black man,
especially a grown black man,

03:41.554 --> 03:44.515
I have a weird relationship
with the cops, man.

03:44.599 --> 03:48.770
Like, on one hand I'm a black man
so I'm like, "Fuck the police."

03:49.812 --> 03:53.316
And on the other hand, I own property.

03:57.612 --> 04:01.616
You know, if somebody comes and breaks
in my house, I'm not calling the crips.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.120
Uh, yo, crips...

04:07.038 --> 04:08.790
can you send Lil' JJ down?

04:09.749 --> 04:11.042
Oh, he's here already.

04:15.672 --> 04:19.091
My bad. My bad." I mean, here's the thing
with the cops, though,

04:19.259 --> 04:23.972
I mean, being a cop is a hard job, man.
It's a hard fucking job, man.

04:24.180 --> 04:26.933
I mean, honestly, I don't think they pay
cops enough.

04:27.934 --> 04:32.355
I don't think they pay police enough.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.650
And you get what you pay for.

04:40.738 --> 04:46.035
Here's the thing, man. Whenever the cops
gun down an innocent black man...

04:46.661 --> 04:49.414
they always say the same things, man.
They always say the same thing.

04:49.497 --> 04:53.960
It's like, "Well, it's not most cops.
It's just a few bad apples."

04:54.877 --> 04:57.213
It's just a few bad apples.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.631
Bad apple?

04:59.007 --> 05:01.426
That's a lovely name for murderer.

05:03.136 --> 05:07.223
It's like, how'd they get that one?
"Bad apple?" That almost sounds nice.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.268
I mean, I've had a bad apple.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.187
It was tart.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.482
But it didn't choke me out.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.739
Here's the thing. Here's the thing.
I know it's hard being a cop.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.074
I know it's hard.
I know that shit's dangerous.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.160
I know it is, ok?

05:27.702 --> 05:31.289
But some jobs can't have bad apples.

05:32.206 --> 05:36.002
Ok? Some jobs, everybody gotta be good.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.297
Like... pilots.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.009
You know?

05:43.926 --> 05:48.723
American Airlines can't be like,
"Most of our pilots like to land.

05:51.934 --> 05:54.062
We just got a few bad apples...

05:54.979 --> 05:56.981
that like to crash into mountains.

05:58.316 --> 05:59.817
Please bear with us."

06:02.945 --> 06:04.906
America's insane, man.

06:05.656 --> 06:07.950
Cops shooting motherfuckers, man.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.620
You know, we got cop problems.

06:10.703 --> 06:14.832
We got the gun problems.
This gun shit ain't going nowhere, ok?

06:15.208 --> 06:18.628
It's like, "Gun control." There ain't
never gonna be no gun control, ok?

06:18.711 --> 06:21.297
You talk about it too long
and you will get shot.

06:23.132 --> 06:25.885
They will shoot yo ass, ok?

06:26.427 --> 06:29.722
That's right. They never,
ever changing the gun laws.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.892
Because Americans need the right to hunt.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.395
They need to hunt. It's like, "Really?"

06:36.687 --> 06:38.898
Hunting's that fucking important?
I mean...

06:39.065 --> 06:40.858
I've been hunting. I've been hunting.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.694
I used to hunt with my grandfather
as a kid in South Carolina.

06:44.028 --> 06:47.448
Went hunting with my grandfather.
Uh, I shot a rabbit.

06:49.575 --> 06:50.785
I cried.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.040
He called me a faggot.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.006
And he's a preacher.

07:09.220 --> 07:12.306
They will shoot 100 people in Vegas, ok?

07:12.390 --> 07:14.392
And somebody will come on TV.

07:14.475 --> 07:16.102
You know, and they'll just talk like...

07:16.185 --> 07:21.274
"Hey, you know, guns don't kill people.
People kill people.

07:21.899 --> 07:27.113
As a matter of fact, if the gunman
would've had a knife...

07:28.156 --> 07:30.908
he could've stabbed 100 people to death.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.912
Could've stabbed 100 people?

07:36.122 --> 07:37.790
Yo, check this out. Check this out.

07:38.499 --> 07:42.712
If 100 people ever got stabbed,

07:43.713 --> 07:45.715
at the same time,

07:46.757 --> 07:50.136
in the same place by the same person,

07:51.554 --> 07:53.556
you know what that would mean?

07:55.433 --> 07:59.061
Ninety-seven people deserved to die.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.569
What? You just watching this shit?

08:07.904 --> 08:09.906
"Oh shit, somebody got stabbed.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.492
Oh, they stabbed somebody else.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.577
Oh, he stabbed somebody else.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.579
Oh, he getting closer.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.124
Oh, he stabbed me.

08:21.459 --> 08:23.044
I didn't see that coming.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.922
Oh, he stabbed the lady behind me.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.216
He's a stabbin' fool.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.886
Guess that's why they call him Stabby."

08:33.971 --> 08:37.015
Yo, it is so good to be here right now.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.602
Glad to be back. Here's the weird thing.

08:44.857 --> 08:47.568
I've been so busy, man. I've been busy.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.363
People like, "Where you been?
Been busy, trying to raise some kids.

08:51.155 --> 08:52.573
That shit's a job.

08:53.741 --> 08:56.619
Now, my oldest daughter
just started high school.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.080
Just started high school.
Lola just started high school.

08:59.163 --> 09:01.165
And, uh, yep, kept her off the pole.

09:01.457 --> 09:02.917
And, uh...

09:05.419 --> 09:07.255
Kept her off the pole, you know.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.383
She danced a little too hard to Migos,
but we're working on it.

09:11.926 --> 09:16.138
She just started high school and I had
to take her to freshman orientation.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.684
You ever go to freshman orientation?
It's the most boring thing

09:19.767 --> 09:21.894
you will ever do with your kids.

09:22.061 --> 09:25.231
You know, 'cause you sit in an auditorium
quite like this.

09:25.606 --> 09:28.484
With, you know, a couple thousand kids.

09:28.734 --> 09:32.780
People come up and speak
and just lie to children.

09:33.864 --> 09:38.744
That's all that happens all day is
people come up and lie to children

09:38.828 --> 09:40.079
about the future.

09:40.496 --> 09:42.832
And I'm sitting there
and this lady comes up and goes,

09:42.915 --> 09:47.128
"I want you children to know
you can be anything you wanna be.

09:47.587 --> 09:52.133
You can be absolutely anything
you wanna be."

09:52.216 --> 09:55.511
I'm like, "Lady, why are you lying
to these children?"

09:56.470 --> 09:59.807
Maybe four of them could be
anything they wanna be.

10:01.726 --> 10:05.313
But the other 2,000
better learn how to weld.

10:07.565 --> 10:10.735
Shit, I'm looking at these kids right now.

10:10.818 --> 10:13.654
I count at least 60 Uber drivers.

10:17.491 --> 10:21.537
They could be anything they wanna be.
Shut the fuck up.

10:21.954 --> 10:23.956
Really? They could be
anything they wanna be?

10:24.540 --> 10:26.542
Then how come you're a vice principal?

10:28.794 --> 10:30.254
Was that the dream?

10:31.672 --> 10:34.592
Did you dress up like a vice principal
when you was a kid?

10:35.259 --> 10:37.261
Put your little vice principal hat on?

10:39.221 --> 10:41.432
Tell the kids the truth.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.225
Tell the kids the fucking truth.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.603
Say, "Hey kids, check this out.

10:45.978 --> 10:49.815
Check this out.
You can be anything you're good at.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.152
As long as they're hiring."

11:00.951 --> 11:03.454
And even then it helps to know somebody.

11:06.040 --> 11:09.835
So, I'm sitting there. I'm in school
and I'm watching this shit.

11:09.919 --> 11:14.965
And it dawned on me
that this orientation wasn't right.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.968
You know, 'cause I got black kids, man.

11:18.636 --> 11:21.972
You know, and I'm sitting there,
I'm like, "I don't think this is right."

11:22.348 --> 11:24.809
I think they need separate orientations.

11:26.060 --> 11:30.439
I think they need a black orientation,
white, gay, straight, Mexican, whatever.

11:30.981 --> 11:33.859
Because the black kids, you're, you're...

11:33.943 --> 11:36.946
You know, you're getting ready to face
a whole other world.

11:37.154 --> 11:40.574
I got black kids. I gotta get them ready
for the white man.

11:41.117 --> 11:44.120
I gotta get them ready for America, man.

11:44.495 --> 11:45.955
You know? It's like, you know.

11:46.038 --> 11:49.333
I mean, not the white man that's
here tonight. You guys are alright.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.670
Ya'll cool. Every one of you.

11:53.003 --> 11:56.048
I want you to know every dime you spent
tonight is going towards

11:56.132 --> 11:58.384
putting little black girls
through private school.

12:05.850 --> 12:09.311
Anybody ask you what you did tonight,
you go, "I made a difference."

12:16.861 --> 12:21.615
But so I'm at school and I'm like, "Yo,
I think we need separate orientations."

12:22.283 --> 12:24.702
'Cause you gotta get your kids ready
for the white man.

12:25.119 --> 12:28.330
If you're not, then you're fucking up
as a parent, ok?

12:28.748 --> 12:32.877
I've been getting my kids ready
for the white man since they was born.

12:32.960 --> 12:33.836
Ok?

12:34.003 --> 12:37.757
Even before they was born, I've been
preparing them for the white man.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.510
Yeah. That's right.
My house, we don't have fire drills.

12:43.387 --> 12:45.389
We have white-r drills.

12:46.807 --> 12:49.018
So, ever since my kids were born,

12:49.101 --> 12:51.604
I've been getting them ready
for the white man.

12:52.313 --> 12:54.315
So, everything in my house...

12:54.648 --> 12:56.150
that's the color white...

12:57.443 --> 13:00.613
is either hot, heavy, or sharp.

13:07.286 --> 13:09.955
So, my kids know when they deal
with anything white,

13:10.039 --> 13:12.041
they gotta think about that shit.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.050
They gotta contemplate this shit.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.594
"Oh, this napkin, ok.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.514
Should I wipe my mouth with it?

13:26.931 --> 13:29.308
Or is that what whitey wants me to do?"

13:32.186 --> 13:35.147
Ever since they was born,
everything in my house,

13:35.231 --> 13:37.233
hot, heavy, or sharp.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.611
They sit on a white toilet seat.
Burn their ass.

13:42.738 --> 13:44.740
"Daddy, my ass is burning."

13:44.824 --> 13:46.826
"It's white motherfucker. It's white.

13:47.868 --> 13:49.453
That's what whitey do.

13:50.579 --> 13:52.581
He burn your fucking ass.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.377
Pay attention."

14:02.883 --> 14:09.181
Shit, when they was little girls,
their white onesie weighed 150 pounds.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.601
"Daddy!

14:13.227 --> 14:16.772
Dad, it's so heavy.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.191
It's so heavy.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.819
This hurts. I can't even stand.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.904
I can't even stand."

14:23.988 --> 14:26.323
"It's white, motherfucker. It's white.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.033
That's what whitey do.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.869
He break your back."

14:37.751 --> 14:41.005
At their birthday party,
I gave them vanilla ice cream...

14:42.131 --> 14:43.424
with glass in it.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.224
"Daddy, my tongue's bleeding."

14:53.267 --> 14:54.727
"Should've got chocolate."

15:05.070 --> 15:08.532
Yeah, I go hard.
I got girls and I go hard.

15:09.366 --> 15:13.162
So, if you got a black son, shit,
you gotta just punch him in the face.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.417
So, as soon as he wakes up
in the morning, it's like,

15:18.500 --> 15:20.085
"Morning, nigga. Pow."

15:25.466 --> 15:28.218
If you don't punch your black son
in the face,

15:28.302 --> 15:29.762
that's child abuse.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.643
It's rough out there for a black boy, man.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.770
It's rough! That's right.

15:37.853 --> 15:42.483
Some people say young black men are
an endangered species.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.234
But, that's not true.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.821
Because endangered species are protected
by the government.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.413
True.

15:56.872 --> 16:00.709
That's right, you got to punch
your black son in the fucking face.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.087
You understand me? Hard.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.339
Yeah, I said it.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.467
On Netflix, I said that shit.

16:09.551 --> 16:14.640
You understand? It's important that
your  black son follow your instructions.

16:14.723 --> 16:17.977
It's the difference between
life and death, ok?

16:18.268 --> 16:19.728
Ok? Yeah.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.898
Yeah, 'cause we got a crazy justice system
out here, man.

16:23.023 --> 16:25.651
We got a justice system for rich,
for poor, for black, for white.

16:25.734 --> 16:30.572
We live in a country where two people
can do the exact same crime

16:30.656 --> 16:35.244
in the exact same place at the exact
same time and get a different sentence.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.121
Only in America.

16:37.454 --> 16:39.623
We gotta change this justice system, yo.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.709
The American justice system

16:41.792 --> 16:43.460
should be like Walmart.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.880
Should be just like Walmart.

16:47.047 --> 16:51.552
It's like, "Hey, if you can find a lighter
sentence, we'll match it."

16:58.308 --> 17:00.894
So, I'm at the school. I'm at the school.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.605
And, the lady comes back out.

17:04.106 --> 17:08.318
She goes, "I want you to know that
the school has absolutely no bullies.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.779
We have a no-bully policy.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.156
We don't-- We don't--
We don't permit bullying.

17:13.574 --> 17:16.492
Any bullies will be kicked out of school
immediately."

17:17.286 --> 17:21.707
And right then, I wanted to take
my daughter out the school.

17:22.915 --> 17:26.002
It's like, "What kind of half-assed
education is this?"

17:28.255 --> 17:32.509
I mean, school is supposed
to prepare you for life.

17:33.510 --> 17:35.846
Life has assholes.

17:36.972 --> 17:39.475
And you should learn how to deal
with them

17:39.558 --> 17:41.185
as soon as possible.

17:42.519 --> 17:46.231
God forbid, you wait till you're 30
to find out people ain't shit.

17:50.194 --> 17:52.196
That's a lesson you need, quick.

17:53.655 --> 17:56.158
That's right. I mean,
one of the problems with the world

17:56.241 --> 18:00.204
is we got too many people
telling they kids how special they are.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.999
These souped up kids
walking the streets today

18:04.083 --> 18:06.085
thinking they're fucking special.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.587
I'm walking down the street,
always some kid,

18:08.670 --> 18:10.214
"Hey, good work, Chris.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.925
Really funny, Chris. Love your work."

18:13.008 --> 18:15.010
I'm like, "It's Mr. Rock, bitch."

18:21.141 --> 18:24.311
Stop telling your kids that they special.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.647
Maybe they special to you.

18:27.856 --> 18:29.316
But not to me.

18:29.650 --> 18:30.776
I don't play that shit.

18:31.193 --> 18:34.029
Everyday before my kids leave to school,

18:34.113 --> 18:36.824
I get them at the door.
I'm like, "Lola, Zahra, check this out.

18:36.907 --> 18:40.661
Soon as you leave this door,
nobody gives a fuck about you.

18:42.121 --> 18:46.291
Nobody in the whole world
gives a fuck about you.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.961
Nobody thinks you're cute.
Nobody thinks you're smart.

18:49.044 --> 18:51.213
Nobody gives a fuck about your opinion.

18:51.296 --> 18:55.884
Nobody on the whole earth
outside of this door

18:55.968 --> 18:58.554
gives a fuck about you.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.391
Nobody!

19:03.058 --> 19:05.894
And even some of the people
inside the house...

19:07.688 --> 19:09.314
...a little on the fence."

19:14.319 --> 19:15.821
We need bullies.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.198
How the fuck you gonna have a school
with no bullies?

19:18.699 --> 19:21.118
Bullies do half the work.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.786
That's right.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.329
Teachers do one half.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.874
Bullies do the whole other half.

19:27.291 --> 19:30.836
And that's the half you're gonna use
as a fucking grown-up.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.798
That's right. Who gives a fuck
if you can code...

19:36.675 --> 19:40.137
if you start crying
'cause your boss didn't say hi?

19:45.893 --> 19:48.979
You fucking weak bitch.
Get the fuck away from me.

19:50.647 --> 19:54.026
You think kids were nice to Bill Gates
in high school?

19:55.152 --> 19:58.530
"Hey, Gates, you Charlie Brown-looking
motherfucker.

19:59.448 --> 20:02.618
Fuck you, Gates. You four-eyed bitch.

20:03.660 --> 20:07.623
Fuck you and your windows,
you gape-tooth motherfucker.

20:08.957 --> 20:12.002
I'm gonna smack the shit out of you,
fucking Gate.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.754
Gate motherfucker.

20:13.962 --> 20:15.964
You can't get in the gate, Gates."

20:19.843 --> 20:24.139
You think kids were nice
to Mark Zuckerberg in high school?

20:24.431 --> 20:26.183
"Hey, Zucker-fuck.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.562
Zucker-fucker. Mother-Zucker. Mother.

20:30.979 --> 20:32.856
Zuck-Zucker, mother-Zuck.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.983
Suck my nuts-er, Zucker.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.903
Mother-Zucker. Mother-Zuck.
Zucker-mother.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.530
Zucker-mother. Mother-Zucker."

20:44.243 --> 20:48.622
He invented Facebook after somebody
smacked him in the face with a book.

20:52.376 --> 20:55.295
He invented Facebook just to get friends.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.716
We need bullies.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.052
Shit, pressure makes diamonds.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.471
Not hugs.

21:06.765 --> 21:09.434
That's right. Hug a piece of coal
and watch what you get.

21:10.185 --> 21:11.812
You get a dirty shirt.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.734
I'm telling you, we need fucking bullies.

21:17.943 --> 21:21.238
That's why there's so many fat kids
in school right now.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.366
'Cause there's nobody
to take their lunch money.

21:32.666 --> 21:35.794
You know what they buy
with all that money? Seconds.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.799
We need bullies, man.

21:41.758 --> 21:45.137
I hate when people go, "You know what,
cyber bullying is worse."

21:45.679 --> 21:46.638
Shut up.

21:47.389 --> 21:51.018
I never heard of anybody getting
cyber kicked down a flight of stairs.

21:52.644 --> 21:56.064
I've never heard of anybody getting
a cyber bag of piss thrown at them.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.987
We need fucking bullies. Shit,
that's how Trump became president.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.740
That's exactly what happened.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.533
We got rid of bullies.

22:07.117 --> 22:11.830
A real bully showed up,
and nobody knew how to handle him.

22:20.881 --> 22:21.798
Shit.

22:22.966 --> 22:27.471
The cast of  The Apprentice  is
running the world.

22:30.974 --> 22:33.477
Trump, the daughter, Omarosa.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.773
They run the world, man.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.776
Yo, man, this shit is crazy.

22:41.902 --> 22:46.073
A lot of people are like, "Well, Trump is
a bad person and he gonna get his".

22:46.615 --> 22:48.950
You know, some people never get theirs.

22:52.454 --> 22:54.206
Some people just fail up.

22:55.332 --> 22:58.752
People are like, "Well, you know,
what goes around comes around."

22:58.835 --> 22:59.795
No, it don't.

23:01.838 --> 23:04.341
Sometimes it just keeps going around.

23:07.761 --> 23:10.180
Ain't nothing gonna happen to Trump, man.

23:10.597 --> 23:13.100
Nothing's gonna happen to Trump.
Here's the crazy thing.

23:13.683 --> 23:15.185
It might just work out.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.813
Trump might work out.

23:18.772 --> 23:21.441
Yeah, I said it.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.819
Trump might work out. I mean,
think about it this way.

23:24.611 --> 23:26.613
Bush was so bad...

23:26.988 --> 23:28.698
he gave us Obama.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.869
You forget that shit, don't you?

23:33.370 --> 23:35.497
Bush was so bad that people said,

23:35.580 --> 23:37.874
"Hey, maybe this black guy has
the answers."

23:42.963 --> 23:47.384
I think people overlook George Bush's
contributions to black history.

23:54.433 --> 23:57.269
George Bush is a black revolutionary.

23:58.728 --> 24:01.565
Malcolm X, Rosa Parks, George Bush.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.695
They need to honor him
at the  Essence  Festival.

24:13.243 --> 24:15.871
It might work out, man. Think about it.

24:16.121 --> 24:19.958
Bush was so bad he gave us Obama.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.419
Shit, Trump's so bad...

24:22.878 --> 24:24.880
he gonna give us Jesus.

24:29.634 --> 24:32.012
"Jesus, what you doing here?"
"You seen Trump?"

24:33.638 --> 24:35.015
This shit is serious.

24:37.184 --> 24:38.643
Oh, man.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.773
Jesus. I'm trying
to get my life together, man.

24:43.857 --> 24:46.234
I'm trying to get a little religion
in my life.

24:46.860 --> 24:47.819
Just a little.

24:49.613 --> 24:50.864
Just a little.

24:52.115 --> 24:54.117
Religion is kinda like salt.

24:57.204 --> 25:01.208
A sprinkle is good,
but too much will fuck up the meal.

25:03.335 --> 25:08.507
I mean, I'm basically trying to find God
before God finds me.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.805
But, God never finds you at a good time.

25:16.431 --> 25:19.476
You're never sitting court side
at a Knick game....

25:19.726 --> 25:22.187
getting a hand job
from Halle Berry, and...

25:23.021 --> 25:25.857
God shows up.
"She strokes a good dick, don't she?

25:27.400 --> 25:30.028
I made her. I made your dick too.

25:30.570 --> 25:31.780
Enjoy the game."

25:35.575 --> 25:37.911
God never shows up at those times.

25:38.286 --> 25:41.248
No, God shows up
after you've been raped in jail.

25:45.126 --> 25:47.504
And you're in jail for parking tickets.

25:55.178 --> 25:57.514
Now, if you in jail for murder,

25:58.139 --> 26:02.143
and somebody's raping you, you're like,
"Ok, I guess this is what I deserve.

26:03.436 --> 26:05.188
I did kill somebody.

26:05.730 --> 26:07.732
Now somebody is killing my ass.

26:09.359 --> 26:10.402
Rape on."

26:13.780 --> 26:16.366
But if you in jail for parking tickets,

26:17.242 --> 26:19.786
and somebody's fucking you in your ass,

26:20.620 --> 26:21.496
you're like,

26:22.205 --> 26:24.207
"I should've moved that car."

26:31.923 --> 26:33.341
"What was I thinking?

26:34.426 --> 26:36.011
I thought it was Good Friday.

26:37.637 --> 26:39.180
They keep moving Easter."

26:42.350 --> 26:45.353
Trying to find God before God finds me.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.731
You know, lotta religion in the news, man.

26:47.981 --> 26:51.526
You ever watch the news, they're always
talking about religious extremists.

26:52.485 --> 26:54.487
We're at war with extremists.

26:54.946 --> 26:57.532
Extremists. What is a religious extremist?

26:58.491 --> 27:03.455
A religious extremist is a person
that extremely believes in God.

27:04.539 --> 27:09.252
You think you believe in God.
No, they extremely... believe in God.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.880
Like, "God coming back on Wednesday.

27:11.963 --> 27:15.133
At 2:30, I got tickets.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.887
Fantasia is opening for him.

27:20.388 --> 27:22.682
I hear Charlie Wilson might stop by."

27:23.808 --> 27:27.354
That's right. Religious extremists
extremely believe in God.

27:27.812 --> 27:30.273
And occasionally blow shit up.

27:31.316 --> 27:33.234
Which is really odd
when you think about it.

27:33.318 --> 27:34.944
'Cause if you truly believe in God,

27:35.028 --> 27:37.906
you believe that God created the Earth,
the moon, the stars, the sun.

27:37.989 --> 27:41.910
You believe that God is
the most powerful being in the universe.

27:41.993 --> 27:45.372
So, if you believe God's the most powerful
being in the universe,

27:45.455 --> 27:48.124
why would he need your help?

27:49.793 --> 27:51.586
What is that shit?

27:52.295 --> 27:55.006
And... It... I'm sorry.

27:57.217 --> 28:00.679
Helping God? And it's never
nobody smart helping God out.

28:01.471 --> 28:05.016
It's never Malcolm Gladwell
or Neil deGrasse Tyson.

28:05.975 --> 28:10.313
It's always some motherfucker that was
working at Circuit City two weeks ago.

28:11.398 --> 28:12.857
It's like, "What the fuck?

28:13.233 --> 28:15.610
Wasn't you loading trucks two weeks ago?

28:15.860 --> 28:17.570
Now you're helping out God?

28:18.113 --> 28:19.656
That is some promotion."

28:21.199 --> 28:23.201
What the fuck is going on?

28:23.702 --> 28:25.704
I mean, here's the thing. I think...

28:26.454 --> 28:29.207
the act of helping God is sacrilegious.

28:29.999 --> 28:33.545
If you think you can help God out,
you don't believe in God.

28:33.962 --> 28:37.340
If you really had faith you'd really
have faith. I mean, check this out.

28:37.424 --> 28:40.927
I haven't been to church in ten years.

28:41.469 --> 28:43.471
Now that's believing in God.

28:48.226 --> 28:50.979
Shit, you go every week
'cause you don't trust God.

28:56.151 --> 28:58.570
Nah, man. But I love religion.

28:58.653 --> 29:01.531
I love watching religion,
studying religion.

29:01.781 --> 29:05.702
The cool thing about religion is,
like, no matter who you pray to,

29:06.119 --> 29:07.871
no matter what you study,

29:08.288 --> 29:09.581
every religion...

29:09.998 --> 29:13.168
follows one basic premise.

29:13.251 --> 29:17.380
One basic idea
that every religion follows.

29:17.464 --> 29:22.927
And that... And that premise is,
God doesn't make mistakes.

29:23.803 --> 29:25.513
Every religion believes that. Every one.

29:25.597 --> 29:28.975
"God, does not make...

29:32.520 --> 29:34.105
mistakes.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.232
I said, God...

29:37.901 --> 29:39.903
does not make...

29:41.488 --> 29:42.989
mistakes.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.912
Ok, God don't make no mistakes?

29:49.996 --> 29:52.081
That's-- That's... Ok. That's...

29:52.165 --> 29:54.501
That's a pretty ambitious thing to say.

29:55.126 --> 29:57.796
No mistakes? You ever read the Bible?

29:59.172 --> 30:02.634
What does the Bible say happened
on the seventh day?

30:03.468 --> 30:05.053
God rested.

30:05.720 --> 30:10.767
Ok, seems odd that a perfect being
would rest.

30:13.478 --> 30:14.771
Let me ask you a question.

30:15.563 --> 30:18.066
Have you ever been performing a task?

30:18.983 --> 30:24.113
It was going perfect, and you took a rest?

30:26.115 --> 30:28.284
Has that ever happened in your life?

30:28.827 --> 30:32.622
No, that has never fucking happened
to you.

30:32.914 --> 30:37.168
What has happened to you was you were
performing a task, you fucked up,

30:38.461 --> 30:43.508
and you thought, "Let me rest...
before I fuck this up some more."

30:48.847 --> 30:52.183
God doesn't make mistakes.
Hush your mouth.

30:53.309 --> 30:55.311
God make plenty of mistakes.

30:55.395 --> 30:56.771
You ever see a porcupine?

30:59.482 --> 31:01.484
Can't eat it. Can't hug it.

31:02.443 --> 31:05.238
It's ugly, sticky,
shitting all over the place.

31:05.864 --> 31:06.823
Mistake.

31:11.911 --> 31:13.663
What about quicksand?

31:15.123 --> 31:16.875
Sand you can drown in.

31:17.917 --> 31:19.586
You can drown dry.

31:21.004 --> 31:23.631
You think God meant to make quicksand?

31:24.549 --> 31:25.592
Mistake.

31:28.761 --> 31:30.763
You ever been to Mississippi?

31:34.851 --> 31:35.935
Mistake.

31:37.186 --> 31:40.565
M-I-S-S-T-A-K-E!

31:45.945 --> 31:49.616
You fucking kidding me?
Just a big hunk of racist dirt.

31:51.159 --> 31:54.370
Fucking Mississippi.
I was there a couple of months ago.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.165
I couldn't even tell what year it was.

31:58.374 --> 32:01.628
That's how fucked up and ghetto
that shit was.

32:01.711 --> 32:05.131
Like, God damn.
You know what Mississippi's like?

32:06.257 --> 32:08.509
You know, like,
when you go to the Caribbean?

32:09.260 --> 32:13.139
You know when you go to the Caribbean,
you land and you get in that van?

32:14.766 --> 32:18.895
That drive. That scary-ass drive...

32:19.938 --> 32:22.774
from the airport to the resort.

32:24.317 --> 32:27.528
And you're looking out the window,
you're like, "What the fuck?

32:28.404 --> 32:31.407
What the fuck is that shit?

32:31.616 --> 32:33.326
Oh, my God!

32:33.701 --> 32:34.994
Whoa!"

32:35.495 --> 32:37.747
You see little kids eating dreadlocks.

32:42.585 --> 32:45.046
You see Shabba Ranks stabbing a dog.

32:45.129 --> 32:47.173
Shabba. Shabba.

32:47.256 --> 32:49.509
Shabba. Shabba.

32:53.513 --> 32:57.183
See, people looking
like they never saw a car before.

33:06.150 --> 33:07.735
Wheel. Wheel.

33:09.529 --> 33:12.782
Then you get to the resort
and you're like, "Jamaica's nice."

33:21.165 --> 33:23.501
"It's so nice.
We should invite your mother."

33:27.463 --> 33:28.381
Shit.

33:29.090 --> 33:31.676
They give you one piña colada...

33:34.345 --> 33:37.598
and you forgive the worst poverty
you've ever seen.

33:42.979 --> 33:44.981
You take one sip, you're like...

33:45.356 --> 33:47.650
"That baby wasn't really dead, right?"

33:55.491 --> 33:57.160
"I can't wait to jet ski."

34:02.206 --> 34:05.251
Trying to find God before God finds me.

34:06.252 --> 34:08.004
Trying to get my life together, man.

34:08.379 --> 34:11.966
I had a crazy... Last few years have been
crazy for me, man.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.385
Uh... You know.

34:14.552 --> 34:17.429
Taking care of my kids, man.
I got divorced.

34:18.347 --> 34:20.725
Divorced. No, no. Don't...

34:21.684 --> 34:22.643
No.

34:22.726 --> 34:25.313
Don't clap for that shit
unless you're a lawyer.

34:27.148 --> 34:30.525
You don't wanna get divorced.
Let me tell you right now.

34:30.610 --> 34:33.737
I'm talking-- I'm talking from hell.
You don't want this shit.

34:34.280 --> 34:37.366
Telling you right. If you got somebody
you love, hold tight.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.994
That's right. Hold fucking tight.

34:40.828 --> 34:44.665
Commit. Don't be the one
that's always threatening to leave, too.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.335
That's right.
Love hard or get the fuck out.

34:47.918 --> 34:50.630
If you're gonna leave, leave right now.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.257
That's right. At the show. Right now.

34:55.635 --> 34:59.263
That's right. Just break up.
We got break up booths in the back.

35:00.807 --> 35:05.353
That's right. But before you leave, you
better make sure you got some options.

35:06.854 --> 35:11.317
Some of ya'll been in relationships
so long, you don't know how ugly you are.

35:17.490 --> 35:18.449
That's right.

35:18.574 --> 35:22.495
Love hard or get the fuck out.

35:22.578 --> 35:24.247
Ok. You hear me?

35:24.539 --> 35:26.165
I'm telling you right now.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.584
If you're in a relationship,

35:28.668 --> 35:32.672
all you should be doing is fucking
and going places.

35:34.340 --> 35:36.592
That's all you should be doing.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.221
Having sex and traveling.

35:40.638 --> 35:42.390
Fucking and going places.

35:42.515 --> 35:44.100
You should be coming and going.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.148
That's all you should be doing.

35:50.606 --> 35:52.942
Ok? People say,
"Oh, relationships are tough."

35:53.025 --> 35:53.901
No, they not.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.737
They're only tough when one person's
working on it.

35:57.446 --> 36:00.658
That's right. Two people could
move a couch real easy.

36:02.368 --> 36:04.370
One person can't move it at all.

36:04.996 --> 36:09.167
That's right. If you in a relationship,
let me try to help you right now, ok?

36:09.250 --> 36:11.377
I'm trying to fucking help you, ok?

36:11.836 --> 36:13.838
Ok, first rule. Rule one.

36:14.505 --> 36:16.299
Stop competing.

36:17.133 --> 36:18.885
It's not a fucking competition.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.219
That's right.

36:20.678 --> 36:25.183
Her success is your success
and your success is her success.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.768
Stop competing.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.522
Stop it, ok?

36:31.647 --> 36:33.149
Number two.

36:33.232 --> 36:35.401
Number two, ok?

36:36.986 --> 36:39.363
There is no equality in a relationship.

36:40.823 --> 36:42.825
It's like, "We equals." No, you're not.

36:43.242 --> 36:45.244
You're both there to serve.

36:45.953 --> 36:49.332
You're in the service industry, ok?

36:49.749 --> 36:50.708
That's right.

36:51.125 --> 36:54.170
When you're in a relationship,
you're in a band.

36:55.296 --> 36:56.881
You're in a fucking band.

36:57.256 --> 37:01.802
And when you're in a band, you have roles
that you play in the band.

37:02.261 --> 37:07.141
Sometimes you sing lead
and sometimes you're on tambourine.

37:11.896 --> 37:15.107
And if you're on tambourine,
play it right.

37:16.692 --> 37:19.862
Play it right.
Play it with a fucking smile.

37:20.655 --> 37:24.617
'Cause nobody wants to see
a mad tambourine player.

37:35.086 --> 37:37.046
That's right.
If you're gonna play tambourine,

37:37.129 --> 37:38.673
you play that motherfucker right.

37:38.756 --> 37:40.508
You play it with your ass, like...

37:40.591 --> 37:42.635
♪ Tambourine, motherfucker
Tambourine ♪

37:42.718 --> 37:44.428
♪ Tambourine, motherfucker
Tambourine ♪

37:44.512 --> 37:46.555
♪ Tambourine, motherfucker
Tambourine ♪

37:46.639 --> 37:48.891
♪ Tambourine, motherfucker
Tambourine ♪

37:51.435 --> 37:52.937
Play it like Tina Turner.

37:54.647 --> 37:56.399
That's right. You in a band.

37:57.149 --> 37:58.734
It's like Hall and Oates.

37:59.485 --> 38:01.195
I don't know what Oates does.

38:03.698 --> 38:06.075
But Hall never had a hit record
without him.

38:11.455 --> 38:15.084
Yeah, you wanna stay together.
How do you stay together?

38:15.626 --> 38:17.003
You gotta fuck.

38:18.838 --> 38:22.383
It's that simple. You gots to fuck.

38:23.926 --> 38:29.265
People are like, "When we got together,
it was so fun, but then problems arose."

38:29.807 --> 38:32.601
No they didn't. Nothing arose.

38:34.103 --> 38:38.774
Every problem you have today,
you had when you met.

38:39.066 --> 38:41.485
But you were fucking so you forgave.

38:48.451 --> 38:51.454
That's right.
You knew he didn't do dishes.

38:53.831 --> 38:55.458
But he gave you good dick.

38:57.043 --> 38:59.462
That was a swell trade. Dick for dishes.

39:00.963 --> 39:03.215
You used to love
washing them dick dishes.

39:07.678 --> 39:09.680
You knew she couldn't cook.

39:10.806 --> 39:12.224
But she licked your balls.

39:14.018 --> 39:16.437
You're like,
"Ah, keep licking. We'll order in."

39:20.691 --> 39:22.860
You gots to fuck.

39:23.402 --> 39:25.112
You gotta fuck. You gotta keep it up.

39:25.988 --> 39:28.908
And you gotta fuck
no matter what mood you're in.

39:29.241 --> 39:31.994
You gotta keep the shit moving.

39:32.119 --> 39:35.081
You can't wait for the Holy Ghost
to just get you.

39:37.666 --> 39:38.709
That's right.

39:39.085 --> 39:41.629
That's right.
Ladies, are you listening to me?

39:42.588 --> 39:45.466
Sometimes you gotta
suck a melancholy  dick.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.394
You gotta do what you gotta do.

39:56.894 --> 39:59.397
'Cause I can eat pussy in a horrible mood.

40:03.818 --> 40:06.195
"I can't believe
there's no gas in the car."

40:14.161 --> 40:16.622
"Can't believe there's so much mold
in the basement."

40:21.585 --> 40:23.754
Shit, I eat pussy on 9/11.

40:29.301 --> 40:30.553
Where were you?

40:39.812 --> 40:43.107
No, man. You gots to fuck, man.

40:43.482 --> 40:46.527
Dude, I was married for 16 years.

40:47.069 --> 40:48.696
Married for 16 years. Yeah.

40:48.863 --> 40:51.490
That's a long run.
Hamilton  won't last that long.

40:52.908 --> 40:57.288
I was married for 16 years
in the era of the cellphone.

40:58.831 --> 41:01.542
Which means my 16 years,

41:01.876 --> 41:05.421
is actually longer than my parents' 40.

41:06.297 --> 41:09.508
That's right. In 16 years,
I had more contact

41:09.592 --> 41:14.054
with my ex-wife than my parents did
in 40 years.

41:14.638 --> 41:17.475
Ok? My father used to leave for work

41:17.558 --> 41:20.811
at 6:30 in the morning

41:20.895 --> 41:24.064
and come home at 8:30 at night.

41:24.273 --> 41:29.737
And during the day, him and my mother
had absolutely no contact

41:29.820 --> 41:31.822
at all.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.657
None.

41:34.241 --> 41:35.201
Ok?

41:35.284 --> 41:37.870
That's what a relationship
used to be.

41:38.037 --> 41:40.039
The kids could've been dead.

41:41.540 --> 41:44.960
And he wouldn't have found that shit out
till he got home.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.589
He'd be like, "Baby, the kids are dead."
"What time they die?"

41:48.714 --> 41:50.716
"About eight hours ago."
"Damn, I missed it."

41:53.928 --> 41:56.222
Yes, that's right. You know what else?

41:56.305 --> 41:58.641
They actually missed each other.

41:59.016 --> 42:00.851
They missed each other.

42:01.227 --> 42:04.522
You know you can't miss nobody in 2017.

42:04.939 --> 42:06.941
Not really. You can say it.

42:07.191 --> 42:09.401
But you don't really miss a motherfucker.

42:09.818 --> 42:12.154
'Cause you with them all the time.

42:12.238 --> 42:14.240
They in your fucking pocket.

42:16.033 --> 42:20.287
Soon as you leave, man. Soon as you go
somewhere, you get a fucking text.

42:20.496 --> 42:22.706
You get a ping. You get a beep.

42:22.790 --> 42:26.627
You get a fucking Facebook, an Instagram,
you get something.

42:26.919 --> 42:28.295
You know, a FaceTime.

42:28.420 --> 42:30.464
And then later on your woman goes,

42:30.548 --> 42:32.383
"You act like you don't wanna talk."

42:34.134 --> 42:36.470
Like,
"What the fuck are you talking about?

42:36.554 --> 42:39.348
I know everything you did today.

42:40.766 --> 42:42.893
And I know how people felt about it.

42:45.312 --> 42:47.314
I gave you five likes, bitch.

42:50.609 --> 42:53.445
I gave you three smiley faces
and an eggplant."

42:58.534 --> 43:01.036
Dude, I was not, like, a good husband.

43:01.120 --> 43:03.622
I'll just... I was fucked up. You know?

43:03.706 --> 43:05.332
I was addicted to porn.

43:07.251 --> 43:09.753
I know, billion-dollar industry.
Just me. Right?

43:14.550 --> 43:16.552
I was addicted to porn.

43:16.635 --> 43:18.387
You know. And, you know. You know.

43:18.470 --> 43:20.598
I was 15 minutes late, everywhere.

43:26.312 --> 43:27.771
I got some witnesses.

43:29.273 --> 43:32.776
When you watch too much porn, you know
what happens? Here's what happens to you.

43:33.152 --> 43:35.904
You become, like, sexually autistic.

43:37.698 --> 43:40.409
You develop, like, sexual autism.

43:41.160 --> 43:44.079
You have a hard time
with eye contact and...

43:44.622 --> 43:46.332
verbal cues.

43:47.333 --> 43:49.668
You want everything to be routine.

43:50.002 --> 43:52.504
Like, you can't choke your woman
every night.

43:54.298 --> 43:55.674
You gotta mix it up.

43:56.091 --> 43:57.551
Choke-out Thursdays.

44:01.513 --> 44:05.643
And, what happens, too, you watch too much
porn, you get desensitized. You know?

44:05.726 --> 44:08.896
It's like, when you start watching porn,
it's like, any porn will do.

44:08.979 --> 44:10.773
It's like, "Ah, they're naked! Ooh-hoo!"

44:11.523 --> 44:14.026
Then later on, now you're all fucked up.

44:14.568 --> 44:17.363
And you need a perfect porn cocktail...

44:19.156 --> 44:20.908
to get you off, no?

44:20.991 --> 44:24.078
I was so fucked up. Like,
I'd need an Asian girl,

44:24.411 --> 44:26.413
with a black girl's ass...

44:27.247 --> 44:28.624
that speaks Spanish.

44:32.252 --> 44:34.922
Just to get my dick to move an inch.

44:37.591 --> 44:39.593
I'm a lot better now. Ladies...

44:39.677 --> 44:41.470
that's right, take care of your man.

44:41.553 --> 44:45.265
Fellas, take care of your wives,
your girlfriends. Take care of her.

44:45.933 --> 44:47.267
Or she will leave you.

44:48.352 --> 44:51.855
She will leave you either physically
or mentally.

44:52.648 --> 44:54.650
A woman can leave you mentally.

44:56.735 --> 45:00.364
That's right, like  Star Trek.
Just telepath out this motherfucker.

45:01.740 --> 45:04.993
There's guys that think
they with they wife right now.

45:07.996 --> 45:10.582
But no, nigga, she left you months ago.

45:12.126 --> 45:14.128
She just came 'cause you got tickets.

45:18.716 --> 45:20.718
She ain't with you. She with me.

45:26.098 --> 45:29.560
Oh, man, the older you get,
the more shit you learn. One thing...

45:29.643 --> 45:31.395
the gangster-est shit in the world.

45:31.854 --> 45:36.525
You learn nothing more gangster,
nothing smarter,

45:37.067 --> 45:39.820
nothing more powerful than a housewife.

45:40.863 --> 45:43.949
Housewives are the smartest motherfuckers
on Earth.

45:44.575 --> 45:46.744
People think it's the working woman. No.

45:47.244 --> 45:48.495
Suckers work.

45:53.751 --> 45:54.668
That's right.

45:55.002 --> 45:58.005
Smart people find other people
to work for them.

45:59.590 --> 46:02.843
That's right. That's right.
They got the  Housewives of Atlanta.

46:02.926 --> 46:05.304
They don't got the working bitches
of Atlanta.

46:08.056 --> 46:10.058
Nobody would watch that show.

46:10.893 --> 46:13.020
No, a housewife's a bad motherfucker, boy.

46:13.604 --> 46:16.064
'Cause the housewife has convinced
the husband...

46:16.732 --> 46:18.233
that it's his house, too.

46:20.527 --> 46:23.363
There's a lot of guys in here right now,
think they own a house.

46:24.448 --> 46:26.450
Think it's they house too. No.

46:26.742 --> 46:29.411
She took that house years ago.

46:30.287 --> 46:31.914
And the kids were in on it.

46:33.957 --> 46:35.167
That's right.

46:35.709 --> 46:37.878
That's right,
the housewife's a bad motherfucker.

46:37.961 --> 46:40.631
'Cause the housewife got a little time.
That's right.

46:40.714 --> 46:43.383
So, before Daddy come home,
the housewife get the kids together

46:43.467 --> 46:45.469
and they rehearse a little play...

46:47.554 --> 46:49.973
that they do when Daddy get home.

46:50.057 --> 46:53.060
It's like, "Ok, Daddy gonna be here
in five minutes. You know your lines?"

46:53.143 --> 46:55.395
"I miss you, Daddy." "Good. Good.

46:57.648 --> 47:00.150
You say that soon as he walk in, ok?

47:00.651 --> 47:03.445
I need you to grab his leg
and don't let go.

47:04.822 --> 47:07.324
I'm gonna give him a big piece of chicken.

47:08.909 --> 47:12.788
And when he fall asleep,
we go back to having our house."

47:12.871 --> 47:14.039
Ha-ha!

47:17.626 --> 47:21.046
That's right, fellas.
You don't own a house.

47:21.839 --> 47:24.091
If you live with a woman,
you don't have a house.

47:24.174 --> 47:25.551
That is her fucking house.

47:25.634 --> 47:28.762
Only man that owns anything is
a single man, ok?

47:29.388 --> 47:32.724
And fellas, here's the test, right now.
If you really think...

47:32.808 --> 47:34.309
you own a house, this the test.

47:35.060 --> 47:37.396
Ok, fellas, tonight when you go home,

47:37.771 --> 47:38.981
I want you to try....

47:39.940 --> 47:41.942
I want you to try....

47:42.359 --> 47:45.737
Fellas, when you go home tonight,
I want you to try...

47:46.655 --> 47:49.116
to hang up a picture of your mother.

47:58.542 --> 48:00.002
It's your house, right?

48:00.752 --> 48:01.795
Give it a shot.

48:04.673 --> 48:06.842
"What's that?"
"It's a picture of my mother."

48:06.925 --> 48:08.468
"I don't like that frame."

48:11.889 --> 48:14.391
You'll never see that picture again.

48:16.643 --> 48:18.645
Maybe at your mother's funeral.

48:19.688 --> 48:21.690
She'll go, "Look what I found."

48:22.482 --> 48:24.151
Motherfucker.

48:25.652 --> 48:28.030
Yo, ladies, if you got a good husband,

48:28.113 --> 48:29.698
got a good man, hold on tight.

48:30.449 --> 48:33.327
Another woman will take your husband.

48:34.161 --> 48:35.203
They'll take him.

48:36.079 --> 48:38.707
There's women in here right now
with stolen husbands.

48:41.168 --> 48:42.669
You know who you are.

48:44.254 --> 48:46.131
You're like, "That bitch was slipping."

48:49.384 --> 48:54.306
That's right. Hold tight or another woman
will take your man.

48:54.932 --> 48:55.849
Fellas,

48:57.017 --> 48:58.644
you don't gotta really worry about that.

48:59.853 --> 49:01.521
Nobody's taking your wife.

49:02.773 --> 49:05.442
Oh, don't get me wrong.
They'll fuck your wife.

49:07.569 --> 49:09.029
Oh, they'll fuck her good.

49:09.613 --> 49:11.615
They'll fuck her better than you.

49:12.574 --> 49:14.034
But they not gonna take her.

49:16.328 --> 49:20.374
There's no guy going, "Yeah, I want her
to yell at me the way she yells at him."

49:22.668 --> 49:25.504
"I wanna live in a house
with no pictures of my mother."

49:28.882 --> 49:31.385
Oh, they'll fuck her,
and then they'll return her.

49:32.386 --> 49:34.012
"I believe this is yours."

49:36.848 --> 49:38.850
"Bitch had me feeling bad about myself."

49:41.979 --> 49:43.105
Oh, man.

49:43.188 --> 49:45.565
I fucked up, man. Divorce, man.

49:46.566 --> 49:48.527
You don't want no parts of this shit, man.

49:48.860 --> 49:50.195
And... you know, it's...

49:50.278 --> 49:53.156
It's my fault 'cause
I'm a fucking asshole, man. I'm just...

49:53.240 --> 49:55.283
I... I wasn't... I wasn't a good husband.

49:55.367 --> 49:57.869
I wasn't a good husband. I didn't listen.

49:58.662 --> 50:00.038
I wasn't kind.

50:01.164 --> 50:03.166
True. True. You know?

50:03.250 --> 50:06.294
You know, I had an attitude.
I thought, "Ah, I pay for everything.

50:06.378 --> 50:07.587
I could do what I want."

50:07.963 --> 50:09.589
That shit don't fucking work.

50:10.882 --> 50:13.093
You know,
I just thought I was the shit, man.

50:13.176 --> 50:15.429
Uh, I didn't play the tambourine.

50:17.681 --> 50:20.392
You gotta play the tambourine.
Everybody gotta play the tambourine.

50:21.101 --> 50:22.144
I cheated.

50:25.272 --> 50:29.985
Yeah. I'm serious. I'm not bragging.
I cheated. I was, like, on the road.

50:30.944 --> 50:33.280
You know, I end up sleeping
with three different women.

50:33.363 --> 50:34.448
It's, like, fucked up.

50:34.531 --> 50:37.701
You know what's fucked up?
Here's the thing. When guys cheat...

50:38.243 --> 50:40.245
it's like, we want something new.

50:40.579 --> 50:42.456
We want something new, right?

50:42.539 --> 50:46.209
But, then, you know what happens?
Your woman finds out.

50:46.752 --> 50:48.211
And now she's new.

50:49.212 --> 50:51.214
She's never the same again.

50:51.757 --> 50:53.925
So, now you got new,
but you got a bad new.

50:55.302 --> 50:57.846
You know? You got bad fucking new, man.

50:58.263 --> 51:01.850
And I know every woman in here's like,
"Fuck you, Chris. What the fuck, man?

51:02.768 --> 51:05.020
You? I thought you was alright. You?

51:06.605 --> 51:07.689
Come on, Chris.

51:07.773 --> 51:11.068
What the fuck is wrong with you?
What the fuck is wrong with men?"

51:11.526 --> 51:13.695
I know a bunch of women are
thinking that right now.

51:13.779 --> 51:15.781
Every woman in here's like,
"Fuck you, Chris."

51:16.323 --> 51:20.994
And every guy in here right now is going,
"Three?"

51:24.372 --> 51:26.374
"That's it? Just three?

51:27.125 --> 51:28.502
God damn, nigga.

51:28.585 --> 51:31.088
I work at UPS.
I got more hoes than that.

51:34.299 --> 51:35.383
Three?

51:35.675 --> 51:37.677
You must've really loved your wife.

51:38.386 --> 51:39.846
You a romantic."

51:45.560 --> 51:47.562
Yo, you don't wanna get divorced, man.

51:47.646 --> 51:49.648
This shit is no joke, man.

51:49.731 --> 51:52.234
Had to go through a custody fight
for my kids.

51:52.776 --> 51:54.528
Just to see my kids, man.

51:54.903 --> 51:56.530
That shit's fucked up, man.

51:56.613 --> 51:57.823
First of all,

51:58.323 --> 52:03.078
you don't wanna be a man in family court.

52:04.538 --> 52:07.082
And you don't wanna be a black man
in any court.

52:08.625 --> 52:11.920
Ok, even the black judge comes to work
with his lawyer.

52:15.048 --> 52:17.342
And he keeps his robe on all day.

52:18.385 --> 52:20.387
And writes "Judge" on the back.

52:21.596 --> 52:24.224
Just in case somebody thinks
it's a nigga with a cape.

52:27.769 --> 52:29.354
"Is that a nigga with a cape?"

52:30.564 --> 52:32.107
"Nope, just a judge."

52:33.191 --> 52:36.987
Yo, man, I was in court.
That shit was scary, man.

52:37.070 --> 52:40.282
Like, to not know if you're gonna be able
to fucking see your kids.

52:40.740 --> 52:45.036
You know? And when I got divorced,
I wanted it to be smooth, you know?

52:45.370 --> 52:48.039
So, I bought a house around the corner.

52:48.498 --> 52:53.044
Ok? Like a fucking quarter of a mile.
LIke, right around the fucking corner.

52:53.128 --> 52:55.130
Damn near the same house, ok?

52:55.338 --> 52:57.591
But, it wasn't enough, man.

52:57.674 --> 53:01.511
I went in there and that judge was like,
"Uh, Mr. Rock,

53:02.345 --> 53:05.891
I need to see pictures...

53:06.641 --> 53:12.063
of the beds in the bedroom to make sure
the children have a place to sleep."

53:12.147 --> 53:13.815
I was like, "What... What...

53:13.899 --> 53:15.901
You think I got a manger? What?

53:17.777 --> 53:20.614
Like, I got a million-dollar house
with no beds?"

53:22.365 --> 53:24.910
Ok, showed him the picture, right?

53:25.243 --> 53:28.747
But that wasn't enough.
Then the judge was like, "Uh, Mr. Rock,

53:28.830 --> 53:34.753
I need to see pictures of the refrigerator
and the food inside...

53:35.253 --> 53:38.256
to make sure the children have
enough to eat."

53:38.340 --> 53:39.591
And I'm like...

53:41.051 --> 53:43.053
"What have you heard about me?"

53:47.390 --> 53:49.726
"I'm Chris Rock, not Chris Brown."

53:56.858 --> 53:58.360
Yo, man.

53:58.860 --> 54:01.529
Yo, fellas,
I hope none of you get divorced.

54:01.863 --> 54:04.407
I'm telling you right now, if you ever

54:04.616 --> 54:07.702
do anything good for your kids,
take a picture of that shit.

54:08.411 --> 54:11.873
If you hug them, take a picture.
If you feed them, take a picture.

54:12.082 --> 54:15.126
'Cause you never know when you might
need receipts of love.

54:16.503 --> 54:18.129
Winter is coming.

54:20.382 --> 54:24.052
It worked out. I got my kids.
I got my kids. I got my custody.

54:24.135 --> 54:26.137
It's fucking beautiful, ok?

54:26.680 --> 54:28.265
Got my kids, man.

54:29.057 --> 54:32.519
I just won them this afternoon.
I got my fucking kids, man.

54:32.602 --> 54:34.604
That shit was, like, humiliating, man.

54:34.688 --> 54:37.274
Trying to... prove your parenthood, man.

54:37.857 --> 54:41.820
So, I know I said you're not supposed
to compete in a relationship.

54:42.195 --> 54:44.781
But, after you go through that shit,

54:45.782 --> 54:48.118
like, "Am I gonna lose my kids?

54:48.201 --> 54:51.538
It's like, "Yo, I'm going hard,
every time I have my kids."

54:52.122 --> 54:54.666
And I always went hard,
but I'm going extra hard.

54:54.791 --> 54:57.043
"I don't know what you're doing
at your mother's house,

54:57.127 --> 54:58.461
but we gonna top that shit."

54:59.838 --> 55:01.840
Every motherfucking time, ok?

55:02.048 --> 55:04.050
Sometimes I bring guest stars.

55:06.303 --> 55:09.264
I make sure they go back to her
with a story.

55:09.347 --> 55:12.183
They like, "Mama, Mama,
Drake helped me with my homework."

55:16.855 --> 55:19.524
"Lady Gaga made me
a grilled cheese sandwich."

55:22.736 --> 55:24.612
Ya'll think I'm bullshitting.

55:25.697 --> 55:27.699
Check my Instagram, alright?

55:29.451 --> 55:30.910
And the crazy thing is...

55:32.037 --> 55:34.914
So, after you get through
the custody thing,

55:34.998 --> 55:38.543
then you gotta divide the money.
That's some fucking scary shit, man.

55:38.626 --> 55:41.463
And whoever, whoever...

55:42.297 --> 55:45.300
makes the most money has to pay
the legal fees for the other person.

55:45.383 --> 55:48.636
So, I had to pay
for a lawyer to divorce me.

55:50.722 --> 55:53.183
That's like hiring a hit man to kill you.

55:54.434 --> 55:56.436
It's like, "Ok, here's a picture of me.

55:59.022 --> 56:01.024
I'm gonna be at Burger King...

56:01.399 --> 56:03.735
at 10:38, ok?

56:03.985 --> 56:06.863
Shoot me in the head
and give me a call."

56:08.656 --> 56:09.699
So..

56:11.159 --> 56:14.746
I'm in court. Yo, one day I'm in court
and I'm just looking around.

56:15.288 --> 56:19.542
And, you know, she got three lawyers.
I got three lawyers.

56:19.959 --> 56:21.961
Shit's expensive as fuck.

56:22.712 --> 56:24.714
She got three lawyers.
I got three lawyers.

56:24.798 --> 56:26.508
The judge. The bailiff.

56:26.674 --> 56:30.011
The stenographer. And I'm looking
at all these motherfuckers, man.

56:30.595 --> 56:33.598
I was like,
"Wow, look at this whole town."

56:34.391 --> 56:35.642
Just here.

56:36.309 --> 56:40.230
And I'm looking at all these people
and realize, like, everybody in this room

56:40.313 --> 56:42.273
is far more educated than me.

56:42.899 --> 56:45.568
Everybody.
I dropped out of Boys High, ok.

56:45.652 --> 56:48.154
Got college motherfuckers coming at me,
right?

56:48.446 --> 56:53.368
And I realize everybody in the room, born
to much better circumstances than me.

56:53.451 --> 56:55.662
I'm from Bed-motherfucking-Stuy, baby.

56:55.912 --> 56:59.082
And everybody in there is there
to take my money.

57:01.751 --> 57:05.588
It's like, "Everybody in here is gonna
leave with more money except me."

57:06.798 --> 57:11.261
And they got up that morning. They
brushed they teeth. They put on suits.

57:11.428 --> 57:16.516
They fixed their hair with
the sole purpose of taking my shit.

57:16.933 --> 57:20.854
And, at that moment, I realized something.

57:21.980 --> 57:23.022
I made it.

57:31.156 --> 57:32.407
I made it.

57:32.657 --> 57:34.951
Started from the bottom,
now I'm here.

57:36.035 --> 57:37.579
I made it, man.

57:37.829 --> 57:41.332
And after that, I was like, "Fuck it,
take it. Whatever you need. Take it.

57:41.416 --> 57:43.835
I'll be alright. I'm gonna work.
It's gonna be good."

57:44.210 --> 57:48.006
'Cause here's the crazy thing. Some
of these lessons, you just gotta learn.

57:48.381 --> 57:50.508
Like, I brought this shit on myself.

57:50.884 --> 57:54.637
You know? Nobody told me
to go ho up, you know.

57:58.099 --> 57:59.601
I brought this shit on myself.

57:59.684 --> 58:03.062
And, you just gotta learn some lessons.
Some man lessons. Ok?

58:03.438 --> 58:06.816
I know it's hard being a woman,
but there's a coldness...

58:07.233 --> 58:08.860
that you have to accept...

58:09.694 --> 58:12.155
when you're a man,
especially a black man. It's like...

58:12.238 --> 58:14.741
The worlds cold as a motherfucker, ok?

58:15.200 --> 58:17.285
When you get older, one thing I learned...

58:18.161 --> 58:23.124
only women, children and dogs...

58:23.833 --> 58:25.960
are loved unconditionally.

58:28.296 --> 58:32.342
Women, children, and dogs are loved
unconditionally.

58:32.884 --> 58:35.595
A man is only loved...

58:36.179 --> 58:39.599
under the condition
that he provides something.

58:40.517 --> 58:41.434
Ok?

58:41.559 --> 58:43.728
I've never heard a woman
in my life say,

58:43.811 --> 58:46.814
"You know, after he got laid off,
we got so much closer."

58:50.193 --> 58:53.696
No, no, no.
I once heard my grandmother say,

58:53.780 --> 58:57.033
"A broke man is like a broke hand.

58:57.909 --> 58:59.911
Can't do nothing with it."

59:01.746 --> 59:04.249
What kind of gangster shit is that?

59:07.919 --> 59:13.925
That's right. Women, children,
and dogs are loved unconditionally.

59:14.259 --> 59:18.388
A man is only loved under the condition
that he provides something.

59:18.596 --> 59:20.014
That's right, fellas,

59:20.098 --> 59:21.641
when you meet a new girl,

59:22.141 --> 59:24.143
what do your friends ask you?

59:24.394 --> 59:25.603
"What's she look like?"

59:26.229 --> 59:28.856
Ladies, when you meet a new guy,

59:29.941 --> 59:32.151
what do your friends ask you?

59:32.443 --> 59:34.153
"What does he do?"

59:34.737 --> 59:41.286
"What the fuck does that nigga do
that can help you out?

59:42.996 --> 59:46.708
Can this motherfucker
facilitate a dream or not?

59:48.668 --> 59:51.379
Even right now, Michelle Obama

59:51.671 --> 59:54.799
is looking at Barack, going,
"What's your plans, nigga?"

01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:05.977
"How's that book turning out?

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:08.396
I need to see some pages."

01:00:14.402 --> 01:00:17.155
I remember,
right when my divorce was final,

01:00:17.905 --> 01:00:21.826
I was at a party and I saw Rihanna.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:24.996
I was like, "Ok, let's start this again."

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:32.545
So, I'm at this party, I see Rihanna.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:34.714
I was like, "Ok, let me say whats up."
Right?

01:00:40.595 --> 01:00:42.597
And I'm like, "How you doing, Rihanna?"

01:00:44.515 --> 01:00:46.517
You ever forget how old you are?

01:00:48.853 --> 01:00:52.315
Rihanna looked at me
like I was one of her aunts. Like...

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:59.572
She didn't even register me
as a dick-carrying member of society.

01:01:01.115 --> 01:01:04.285
Like, I would have had an easier time
fucking Aretha Franklin.

01:01:08.873 --> 01:01:12.502
Ah, man. I'm retired. I am, uh...
This cheat shit. I'm done.

01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:15.463
I'm done. You get to a certain age.

01:01:15.963 --> 01:01:18.257
You go, you lost... Shit.
You lose enough shit.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:19.759
It's like, "Fuck this."

01:01:20.218 --> 01:01:21.928
I am done cheating.

01:01:22.345 --> 01:01:25.598
I'm... Hey, I love pussy,
but I like peace more.

01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:30.019
Peace is better than pussy.

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:32.772
Peace makes my dick hard.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.152
I need motherfucking peace, motherfucker.

01:01:38.236 --> 01:01:40.238
You wanna be my girl? Be peaceful.

01:01:40.655 --> 01:01:42.657
Just some peace, motherfucker.

01:01:43.241 --> 01:01:45.451
That's right, I ain't cheating at all,
you know.

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:47.537
I mean, unless Rihanna, you know...

01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:53.584
It's all good, man. Now I'm dating.
I'm actually dating.

01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:55.753
It's just weird, man.

01:01:55.837 --> 01:01:58.214
It's weird.
I was married for a long time, man.

01:01:58.297 --> 01:02:01.801
You know, I date some girls my age.
And some a little younger.

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:03.469
That shit is crazy, man.

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:06.055
Yo, shit has changed.

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:08.391
These girls fuck fast now.

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:12.645
They fuck fast and they leave.

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:16.733
They just get the fuck out yo house.

01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:20.111
They just fuck and leave.
I'm like, "Where you going?

01:02:23.614 --> 01:02:24.866
It's yo place."

01:02:28.953 --> 01:02:30.955
And they fuck immediately.

01:02:31.122 --> 01:02:33.124
I'm a grown man.

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:35.585
And I'm like, "This is inappropriate."

01:02:42.967 --> 01:02:46.262
My God. Young girls like to get on top.

01:02:46.679 --> 01:02:49.098
Always wanna get on top.
"Let me ride it, Daddy.

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:51.893
Let me get on top. Let me ride it.
Let me get on top.

01:02:51.976 --> 01:02:53.728
Let me ride it. Let me ride it.

01:02:53.811 --> 01:02:57.440
Let me ride it." You can't get
no 45 year-old-woman to get on top.

01:02:57.523 --> 01:03:00.193
She's like,
"Nigga, you lucky I'm laying like this."

01:03:04.864 --> 01:03:07.825
"I'll turn over to help you finish,
but that's about it.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.995
These knees are delicate."

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:17.794
Shit, I'm on Tinder right now,
under my own name.

01:03:21.672 --> 01:03:24.425
My friends are like,
"You can't be under your own name.

01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:27.762
What if you find a woman that just wants
you 'cause you're Chris Rock?" I'm like,

01:03:27.845 --> 01:03:29.305
"But I am Chris Rock.

01:03:31.682 --> 01:03:34.060
What should I put?
'Cedric the Entertainer'?"

01:03:38.523 --> 01:03:41.984
Shit, my profile picture
on Tinder right now

01:03:42.276 --> 01:03:44.862
is me, butt-naked,

01:03:45.738 --> 01:03:47.740
holding a microphone,

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:50.076
and a tambourine.

01:03:51.202 --> 01:03:53.204
Hey, I'm out of here. Ya'll take care.

01:03:53.287 --> 01:03:54.372
