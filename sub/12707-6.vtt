PREVIOUSLY ON
BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.

00:03.270 --> 00:05.905
[ Spike ]
 BUFFY, I LOVE YOU.

00:05.939 --> 00:08.976
WE CONJURE THE GODDESS
THESPIA TO HELP US LOCATE
DEMONIC ENERGY.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.010
ARE YOU SURE
WE'RE READY FOR THAT?

00:16.082 --> 00:17.085
[ Willow ]
OR NOT.

00:17.117 --> 00:19.986
TELL ME WHERE THE KEY IS.

00:20.019 --> 00:22.690
THE KEY IS ENERGY.

00:22.722 --> 00:25.059
IT'S A PORTAL.

00:25.092 --> 00:28.228
MY BRETHREN
SENT IT TO YOU.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.731
DAWN.
SHE'S NOT MY SISTER?

00:30.763 --> 00:34.101
SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT.

00:35.569 --> 00:38.037
[ Willow ]
 TELL ME A STORY.

00:38.072 --> 00:44.078
[ Tara ]
 OKAY. ONCE UPON A TIME,
 THERE WAS, UM... A KITTY.

00:44.112 --> 00:48.848
SHE WAS VERY LITTLE,
 AND SHE WAS ALL ALONE,
 AND NOBODY WANTED HER.

00:48.881 --> 00:50.884
[ Willow ]
 THIS IS A VERY UPSETTING STORY.

00:50.917 --> 00:53.121
[ Tara ]
 OH, OH. BUT IT GETS BETTER.
 'CAUSE ONE DAY,

00:53.154 --> 00:55.789
THE KITTY WAS RUNNING
 AROUND THE STREET,
 AND A MAN CAME...

00:55.823 --> 01:00.793
AND SWOOPED HER UP
 AND TOOK HER TO THE POUND.

01:00.828 --> 01:04.132
AND AT THE POUND,
THERE WERE LOTS
OF OTHER KITTIES,

01:04.165 --> 01:06.567
AND THERE WERE PUPPIES,
AND SOME FERRETS.

01:06.599 --> 01:08.801
WERE THERE DOLPHINS?

01:08.835 --> 01:11.704
YES. MANY DOLPHINS
AT THE POUND.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.242
WAS THERE A CAMEL?

01:14.275 --> 01:18.646
THERE WAS THE FRONT
OF A CAMEL, A HALF-CAMEL.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.715
DID THE KITTY GET CHOSEN
BY SOME NICE PEOPLE?

01:21.748 --> 01:26.620
- WELL, NOW YOU'VE
RUINED THE ENDING.
- MMM... I'M SLEEPY.

01:26.653 --> 01:28.956
DO YOU MIND
IF I KEEP THE LIGHT ON?

01:28.989 --> 01:31.125
I WAS GONNA
LOOK UP SOME SPELLS.

01:31.158 --> 01:34.795
THAT'S FINE.
I DON'T NEED TO BE SNUGGLED.

01:34.828 --> 01:37.365
VIXEN.

01:39.866 --> 01:42.335
YOU'VE BEEN SPELL-GAL
NIGHT AND DAY LATELY.

01:42.370 --> 01:44.472
WELL, I JUST WANT
TO KEEP UP WITH YOU,

01:44.504 --> 01:48.841
AND I'M-- WELL, I JUST LIKE
TO BE USEFUL, YOU KNOW,
TO THE GANG.

01:50.311 --> 01:54.481
I JUST NEVER FEEL USEFUL.

01:54.515 --> 01:58.652
YOU ARE.
YOU'RE ESSENTIAL.

02:04.492 --> 02:07.027
DO YOU THINK BUFFY FOUND
OUT ANYTHING TONIGHT?

02:07.060 --> 02:08.929
AT THE FACTORY?
I DON'T KNOW.

02:08.961 --> 02:13.700
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING,
I FIGURED SHE'D CALL US.

02:16.836 --> 02:20.441
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.242
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

02:24.211 --> 02:27.046
SHE HAS NO IDEA?

02:27.079 --> 02:29.049
NO.

02:29.081 --> 02:32.151
SHE THINKS
SHE'S MY KID SISTER.

02:34.153 --> 02:37.525
ARE YOU GOING
TO TELL HER?

02:37.557 --> 02:39.727
HOW CAN I?

02:42.062 --> 02:46.066
SHE'D FREAK, AND THAT'S
THE LAST THING WE NEED.

02:47.901 --> 02:51.572
[ Sighs ]
WE HAVE TO
KEEP HER SAFE.

02:55.276 --> 03:00.381
THIS WOMAN,
 THIS... WHATEVER SHE WAS,
 SHE KNOWS, YOU KNOW.

03:00.413 --> 03:02.316
SHOULD WE BE
THINKING ABOUT--

03:02.349 --> 03:04.651
SENDING DAWN AWAY?

03:04.685 --> 03:06.919
AWAY WHERE?

03:06.954 --> 03:10.223
I DON'T KNOW.
UH...

03:10.258 --> 03:12.860
YOUR FATHER'S?

03:12.893 --> 03:16.264
YEAH, HE'S, UM,
IN SPAIN...

03:16.296 --> 03:21.669
WITH HIS SECRETARY,
LIVING THE CLICHE.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.736
I CALLED HIM
WHEN MOM GOT SICK.

03:23.771 --> 03:26.439
HE HASN'T EVEN--
I'M SORRY.

03:31.412 --> 03:36.283
WHEN HE BAILED ON US,
I REMEMBER DAWN
CRIED FOR A WEEK.

03:38.819 --> 03:42.522
EXCEPT SHE DIDN'T.

03:42.555 --> 03:44.692
SHE WASN'T THERE,

03:44.724 --> 03:48.127
BUT I CAN STILL FEEL
WHAT IT WAS LIKE.

03:55.134 --> 03:57.737
THEY SENT HER
TO ME, GILES.

03:59.006 --> 04:03.743
I THINK I HAVE TO
TAKE CARE OF HER.

04:03.776 --> 04:06.847
I WANT TO.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.082
DO WE TELL THE OTHERS?

04:10.116 --> 04:13.653
NO. NO ONE.

04:15.122 --> 04:17.457
THEY'D-THEY'D
ACT WEIRD AROUND HER,

04:17.490 --> 04:20.894
AND IT'S SAFER FOR
EVERYONE IF THEY DON'T KNOW.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.331
YES.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.569
WE HAVE TO FIND OUT
WHO THIS WOMAN IS,

04:29.603 --> 04:31.338
AND WHAT SHE NEEDS
DAWN FOR.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.408
I MEAN,
IF SHE COMES AFTER YOU--

04:35.442 --> 04:37.545
SHE'LL COME.

04:39.612 --> 04:42.682
SHE'LL COME FOR US.

04:48.288 --> 04:52.492
OKAY. NOW I'M UPSET.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.925
[ Xander ]
OW! THUMB.

05:57.957 --> 06:01.228
NECESSARY OPPOSABLE THUMB.
SORRY. CRYBABY.

06:01.261 --> 06:04.564
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU GUYS?
JUST LEAVE IT HERE.
GOT IT.

06:04.598 --> 06:07.435
I DON'T NEED HELP.
JUST BE CAREFUL.

06:10.137 --> 06:13.673
[ Anya ]
BUT WE JUST HELPED HER MOVE
THE STUFF IN A FEW DAYS AGO...

06:13.706 --> 06:16.576
AND IT WAS FUN.

06:16.610 --> 06:19.045
PEOPLE HELP EACH
OTHER OUT, ANYA.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.449
IT'S ONE OF OUR
STRANGE CUSTOMS.

06:21.481 --> 06:23.417
GILES, I NOTICED YOU WERE
DOING THE SMALLEST
AMOUNT OF HELPING

06:23.451 --> 06:26.353
THAT CAN ACTUALLY
BE CALLED HELPING.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.088
WELL, I SAW MYSELF IN
MORE OF A PATRIARCHAL
SORT OF ROLE.

06:29.122 --> 06:33.093
YOU KNOW, LOTS OF
 POINTING AND SCOWLING.

06:33.125 --> 06:35.428
- YOU TWO, STOP THAT!
- [ Riley ] HE STARTED IT.

06:35.463 --> 06:39.466
[ Xander ] HE CALLED ME A BAD
NAME. I THINK IT WAS BAD.
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LATIN.

06:40.733 --> 06:41.435
STOP IT OR YOU'RE GONNA BREAK
 SOMETHING.

06:41.468 --> 06:43.536
OR I'M GOING
TO BREAK SOMETHING.

06:43.571 --> 06:46.774
STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
 YOU'RE GIVING UP THIS
 CHERRY CORNER SUITE.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.242
JUST A FEW DAYS
AFTER WE MOVED YOU IN.

06:49.276 --> 06:52.646
IT'S NO BIG.

06:52.680 --> 06:56.316
YOU KNOW, WITH MOM
NOT BEING WELL,
I'M HARDLY EVER HERE.

06:56.348 --> 06:58.819
JUST FIGURED
I'D SAVE A LITTLE CASH FOR
THIS SEMESTER, THAT'S ALL.

06:58.851 --> 07:01.420
I THINK THAT'S SMART.

07:01.454 --> 07:03.656
STILL, IT'S HARD TO GIVE UP.
 YOU GOT THE TWO ENTRANCES,

07:05.425 --> 07:06.826
LOT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR
BAWDY FRENCH FARCE,
AND EVERYBODY LOVES BAWDY--

07:06.860 --> 07:10.497
- WHERE'S DAWN?
- I THINK SHE JUST WALKED OUT.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.231
DAWN!

07:12.264 --> 07:14.468
SOME OF YOUR CDs
ARE MY CDs.

07:14.502 --> 07:16.504
I KNOW.
COME HELP ME
FOLD.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.244
[ Groans Softly ]

07:24.276 --> 07:26.613
STARTIN' TO FEEL
THAT FIGHT?

07:26.646 --> 07:30.117
NOTHIN' LIKE GETTIN'
YOUR ASS KICKED
TO MAKE YOUR ASS HURT.

07:30.149 --> 07:32.853
YOU'LL TOTALLY TAKE HER
NEXT TIME.
'CAUSE YOU'LL HAVE BACKUP, BABY.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.822
SHE'S MESSIN'
 WITH ALL OF US.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.923
YES. WE'LL-WE'LL FIND
HER WEAKNESSES AND THEN--

07:36.956 --> 07:39.759
YEAH. YOU LEARN HER SOURCE,

07:39.793 --> 07:42.995
AND WE'LL INTRODUCE HER
TO HER INSECT REFLECTION.

07:46.699 --> 07:48.701
UM, THAT--
 THAT WAS FUNNY IF YOU, UM--

07:48.735 --> 07:53.606
IF YOU STUDIED
TAGLARIN MYTHIC RIGHTS
AND ARE A COMPLETE DORK.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.643
HUH. THEN HOW COME
 XANDER DIDN'T LAUGH?

07:55.675 --> 07:57.944
I DON'T KNOW THAT
TAGLARIN STUFF.
OH.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.480
HEY. YOU WANNA START
TAKING STUFF
DOWN TO THE CAR?

08:00.514 --> 08:02.516
YEAH.
OKAY.

08:02.550 --> 08:05.653
[ Sighs ]
STUPID.

08:05.685 --> 08:08.956
OKAY. GUYS, NOW REMEMBER,
YOU HAVE TO BE
AT THE BRONZE BY 8:00.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.959
BRONZE?

08:11.992 --> 08:13.826
TOMORROW NIGHT,
TARA'S BIRTHDAY.

08:13.860 --> 08:15.963
RIGHT. RIGHT.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.898
WE HAVE TO BRING
PRESENTS, RIGHT?

08:17.930 --> 08:20.167
BIRTH IS
A PRESENT THING?

08:20.199 --> 08:22.536
I GOT SOMETHING
PICKED OUT, YEAH.

08:22.569 --> 08:24.904
YOU GUYS CAN ALL
STILL COME, RIGHT?

08:24.937 --> 08:27.707
I MEAN, I KNOW THERE'S THIS
NEW EVIL AND ALL, BUT--

08:27.740 --> 08:30.377
NO, NO,
WE'LL BE THERE.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.913
I COULD DEFINITELY
USE A BREAK FROM
ALL THIS CRAZINESS.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.350
WHAT'S THE STORY?

08:37.384 --> 08:39.552
ANOTHER CRAZY.
GOT HER FAMILY OUT THERE.

08:39.586 --> 08:41.721
YEAH, LET ME GUESS.
NO HISTORY OF
MENTAL PROBLEMS.

08:41.754 --> 08:44.157
YEAH. THAT MAKES,
LIKE, FIVE THIS MONTH.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.994
THEY TOLD ME SUNNYDALE
WAS GONNA BE INTERESTING.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.931
AREN'T YOU OFF?
YEAH, AS OF NOW.
HAVE FUN.

09:41.148 --> 09:43.450
I NEED A FAVOR.

09:43.482 --> 09:46.720
THANK YOU FOR COMING.
WE VALUE YOUR PATRONAGE.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.755
PLEASE COME AGAIN
FOR MORE PURCHASES!

09:48.788 --> 09:50.624
COULD WE PERHAPS
BE A LITTLE LESS
EFFUSIVE, ANYA?

09:50.658 --> 09:54.394
WE DON'T WANT
TO FRIGHTEN THE PEOPLE.
I'M JUST SO EXCITED.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.596
THEY COME IN. I HELP THEM.
THEY GIVE US MONEY
IN EXCHANGE FOR GOODS.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.767
YOU GIVE ME MONEY
FOR WORKING FOR YOU.

09:59.799 --> 10:02.134
I HAVE A PLACE
IN THE WORLD NOW.

10:02.168 --> 10:05.504
I'M PART OF THE SYSTEM.
I'M A WORKIN' GAL.

10:05.538 --> 10:09.076
YES. WELL, WHY DON'T
YOU START ORGANIZING
THE SHIPPING ORDERS?

10:09.109 --> 10:12.913
OH, NO. THAT'S BORING.
I JUST WANT TO DO
THE MONEY PARTS.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.081
WELL, SURE I FORGOT
ABOUT THE PARTY.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.017
THERE'S KIND OF
A LOT GOING ON.

10:17.049 --> 10:19.286
IT'S NOT, YOU KNOW,

10:19.318 --> 10:21.321
THE MOST THRILLING
SOCIAL EVENT
OF THE SEASON.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.856
YEAH. IT'S A BIG DEAL
FOR WILLOW THOUGH.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.625
I MEAN, YOU ARE
GONNA BE THERE?

10:25.658 --> 10:28.995
YEAH, BARRING
MONSTERS. HEY.

10:29.028 --> 10:31.364
HI.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.200
I'VE COME TO BUY SUGAR.

10:34.802 --> 10:36.870
MMM. MMM...

10:36.903 --> 10:38.638
WE VALUE
YOUR PATRONAGE.

10:38.672 --> 10:41.374
SO, ANY BREAKTHROUGHS
ON THE IDENTITY OF
MISS CONGENIALITY?

10:41.408 --> 10:43.811
WELL, I'VE
NARROWED IT DOWN SOME.

10:45.511 --> 10:47.715
YOUR DEFINITION OF NARROW
IS IMPRESSIVELY WIDE.

10:47.748 --> 10:51.018
WELL, YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME
MUCH TO GO ON.
SHE-- SHE LOOKS HUMAN,

10:51.051 --> 10:52.786
SO THE MUG SHOTS
AREN'T ANY USE,
AND, UH--

10:52.820 --> 10:56.288
YOU CAN'T BE
MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT
WHAT SHE'S LIKE?

10:56.322 --> 10:58.892
SHE WAS KIND OF LIKE
CORDELIA, ACTUALLY.

11:00.659 --> 11:03.363
I'M PRETTY SURE
SHE DYES HER HAIR.

11:03.395 --> 11:05.999
AH, YES,
THAT ONE, OF COURSE.
OUR WORK IS DONE.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.668
- [ Buffy ] THERE MUST BE
 SOMETHING ON HER.
 - THE ANSWER'S SOMEWHERE HERE.

11:08.701 --> 11:12.205
IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF US,
AND WE'RE TOO BLIND TO SEE IT!

11:15.042 --> 11:19.546
I'M HELPING.
I'M READING. I'M QUIET.

11:22.883 --> 11:26.086
SO, WHAT'D YOU GET HER?
HUH?

11:26.119 --> 11:30.057
TARA. YOU SAID YOU GOT
A PRESENT ALREADY.

11:30.090 --> 11:33.059
YEAH, THAT WAS A TANGLED
WEB OF LIES, SWEETIE.

11:33.092 --> 11:35.028
I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT
KIND OF THING SHE'D--

11:35.062 --> 11:37.697
I MEAN, I DON'T REALLY
KNOW HER THAT WELL.

11:37.730 --> 11:40.600
I KNOW.
I MEAN, SHE'S NICE.

11:40.633 --> 11:44.504
YEAH. YEAH, NICE.
NICE...

11:44.537 --> 11:46.405
IT JUST--
I SORT OF--

11:46.438 --> 11:48.942
I DON'T NECESSARILY GET HER,
BUT SHE'S REAL NICE.

11:48.975 --> 11:52.211
YEAH, THERE'S
JUST THAT THING.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.547
THAT THING.

11:54.581 --> 11:58.018
THAT THING OF
NOT UNDERSTANDING--
HALF OF WHAT SHE SAYS?

11:58.051 --> 12:00.452
AS FOR EXAMPLE--
BUT SHE'S SUPER NICE.

12:00.486 --> 12:02.956
YOU BETCHA.

12:02.990 --> 12:06.092
THINK THERE'LL BE
A LOT OF WICCAS THERE,
HEAVY WICCAN CROWD?

12:06.125 --> 12:09.261
WELL, THAT'S SORT OF
HER DEAL. HER AND WILLOW
ARE ALL WICCIE.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.932
SWINGIN' WITH
THE WICCAN LIFESTYLE.
WHICH IS COOL.

12:11.965 --> 12:16.602
OH, YEAH.
I JUST HOPE WE FIT IN,
NOT AWKWARD.

12:16.635 --> 12:21.274
WITH WILLOW, IT'S LIKE
SHE'S GOT THIS WHOLE NEW
THING IN HER LIFE,

12:21.307 --> 12:24.244
BUT SHE'S STILL WILLOW,
SO I CAN ALWAYS
FIGURE HER OUT.

12:24.277 --> 12:27.580
BUT TARA, I JUST KNOW
SHE LIKES WILLOW, AND SHE
ALREADY HAS ONE OF THOSE.

12:27.614 --> 12:31.484
[ Groans ]
I HAVE A PRESENT-BUYING
HEADACHE.

12:31.518 --> 12:35.488
TARA'S DAMN BIRTHDAY
IS JUST ONE TOO MANY THINGS
FOR ME TO WORRY ABOUT.

12:35.522 --> 12:38.625
RELAX. YOU SHOULD
TAKE A FEW MINUTES.
TRAIN OR STRETCH OUT.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.659
YOU SHOULD DO SOMETHIN'
TO WORK OFF THE TENSION.

13:24.403 --> 13:26.806
YOU WANT ME, SLAYER?
COME AND GET ME!

13:26.840 --> 13:29.375
OH, I'M COMING.
I'M COMING RIGHT NOW!

13:29.408 --> 13:31.344
[ Moaning ]

13:36.349 --> 13:38.684
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

13:40.052 --> 13:42.288
ALL ABOUT YOU, BABY.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.557
TCH. OHH.

13:44.591 --> 13:47.226
YOU'RE MY LITTLE LAMB.

13:47.259 --> 13:49.495
COME UP WITH
ANYTHING YET?

13:49.528 --> 13:53.200
WELL, CANDLES,
MAYBE, OR BATH OILS
OF SOME KIND.

13:53.232 --> 13:56.068
I SAW A REALLY CUTE SWEATER
AT BLOOMIES, BUT I THINK
I WANT ME TO HAVE IT.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.072
AND YOU ARE TALKING
ABOUT WHAT ON EARTH?

13:59.105 --> 14:02.341
TARA'S BIRTHDAY.
WE'RE AT A LOSS.

14:02.375 --> 14:06.712
YOU'RE IN A MAGIC SHOP,
 AND YOU CAN'T THINK
 WHAT TARA WOULD LIKE.

14:06.745 --> 14:09.081
I BELIEVE YOU'RE BOTH
PROFOUNDLY STUPID.

14:10.918 --> 14:14.086
WELL, WE DON'T REALLY
KNOW WHAT KIND OF THINGS
WITCHES LIKE.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.188
WHAT, ARE WE GONNA
GET HER SOME CHEESY
CRYSTAL BALL?

14:16.222 --> 14:18.591

SO ALL THESE BOOKS

 A RACE OF FROG-PEOPLE.
 IT'S A GOOD TIME.

[ Laughing ]

14:54.726 --> 14:58.030
HER INSECT REFLECTION.
THAT IS SO GOOD.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.700

WHY DON'T I PICK YOU UP
AT 6:00? AND WE'LL...

A GOOD DAY AT WORK?

- I'M GOING TO MELINDA'S

- SINCE WHEN?

YOU CAN'T. IT'S NOT SAFE
FOR YOU TO WALK THERE.

I'M JUST GONNA GO--

IT'S FAMILY NIGHT.

A BAD INFLUENCE.

I DON'T LIKE YOU
HANGING OUT WITH
SOMEONE THAT... SHORT.

I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE
MOVING BACK INTO THE HOUSE.

OF MY GLADNESS.

I WAS SEARCHING FOR.

18:41.788 --> 18:45.424

GOING OVER THERE.

YEAH, A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE
EXPERIMENTING WITH SHORTNESS.

18:49.229 --> 18:53.266
SHE CAN'T BE RUNNING OUT
WHENEVER SHE'D LIKE.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.972
YOU TELL ME.

19:03.175 --> 19:05.612
WE ALL HAVE
TO BE CAREFUL.

WHAT I'M UP AGAINST.

I COULD CONTACT GRAHAM. GET
THE GOVERNMENT BOYS ON THIS--

NO! NO, I-I DON'T WANT
THEM ANYWHERE NEAR THIS.

19:18.857 --> 19:22.060

THAT ARE INVOLVED,
THE SAFER I WILL FEEL.

ON YOUR MIND.

TO LET ME IN ON ANY OF IT,

 TO SEE ALL THESE...

TO HIDE IT ANYMORE.

 GOTTEN OVER THE WHOLE
 WITCHCRAFT THING.

OF YOUR SYSTEM.

TO LOOK FOR YOU
IN THE-- THAT STORE.

THAT YOU WERE COMING.

FROM YOU IN MONTHS.

 WHAT THAT MEANS.
I DON'T THINK IT'S--

- IT WON'T MEAN THAT--
- YOU'RE TURNING 20.

GOING TO MAKE IT WORSE.

YES, UM, I'D LIKE US ALL
TO START LOOKING
AT THESE ORDERS.
