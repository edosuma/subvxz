00:28.070 --> 00:31.188
- Neil Barlow's Bodgy Creek
Documentary, take one.

00:36.703 --> 00:39.195
My Granddad reckons that
if there was a Nobel Prize

00:39.206 --> 00:40.742
for being a dickhead,

00:40.749 --> 00:42.832
Troy Carrington would win it
every year.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.578
Troy Carrington's AFL footy
career ended

00:46.588 --> 00:47.829
when his leg got mangled

00:47.839 --> 00:50.502
as he ran through the
banner on Grand Final day.

00:50.509 --> 00:53.172
It got caught in the crepe
paper and looked gross.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.295
Around here we call
him Town Killer

00:55.305 --> 00:56.796
because of the greenie
protests he led

00:56.807 --> 00:59.550
that shut down the
Bodgy Creek Timber Mill.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.303
Troy has absolutely no friends.

01:02.312 --> 01:03.302
This is his story.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.706
- Have I come in too early,
Neil?

01:04.730 --> 01:05.562
- Dude, wha...

01:05.566 --> 01:06.522
Troy, I told you.

01:06.525 --> 01:09.393
I'm gonna use this at the
beginning of the documentary.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.565
- Sorry, mate.
- You're too early, Jesus.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.565
Troy Carrington, no mates,
mangled leg, dickhead.

01:16.243 --> 01:19.077
- Bit full on.

02:27.731 --> 02:30.565
It's Warwick Randall here on
Bodgy Creek Community Radio.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.024
The community markets
are on today

02:32.027 --> 02:33.814
at the Recreation Reserve.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.152
However, the Men's Shed won't
be doing

02:35.155 --> 02:38.148
their usual Wood Turning
Exhibition as Len Hutton's

02:38.158 --> 02:40.741
second hip replacement
has been moved forward.

02:40.744 --> 02:42.485
Hopefully they'll open him up

02:42.496 --> 02:44.658
on the correct side this
time around.

- Excuse me, do you have
a stall holder's license?

03:26.373 --> 03:28.365
- No, not yet.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.991
Gretchen over there said
I'd be able to sort it out

03:30.001 --> 03:30.832
on the day.

03:30.836 --> 03:32.202
- Well she's wrong.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.704
You have to apply at
least 14 days in advance

03:34.715 --> 03:35.956
for a stall holder's license.

03:35.966 --> 03:36.797
- Well, I'm here now.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.007
Can't I just...
- We're full!

03:48.979 --> 03:50.470
- It's Neil, isn't it?

03:50.480 --> 03:51.846
I'm Troy.

03:51.857 --> 03:53.519
- I know who you are.

03:53.525 --> 03:54.766
Why are you at the markets?

03:54.776 --> 03:56.768
I thought you were a hermit.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.565
- Well, I'm mostly
self-sufficient out at my place.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.904
I don't have to come into
town much.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.022
- Like a hermit?

04:01.032 --> 04:02.694
- Do you mind not filming me?

04:02.701 --> 04:03.701
- Classic hermit.

04:05.120 --> 04:08.238
I saw you at my dad's funeral
last year.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.705
- That must have been
tough, mate.

04:09.708 --> 04:11.665
I lost my mom when I was your
age, and...

04:11.668 --> 04:14.786
- So hermits can go to
funerals and community markets.

04:14.796 --> 04:15.661
Anything else?

04:15.672 --> 04:16.879
- I'm not a hermit.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.248
- Why did you want the timber
mill shut?

04:18.257 --> 04:19.248
- I didn't.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.125
- Granddad reckons you did.

04:21.136 --> 04:24.049
- I just wanted sustainable
logging for old growth forests.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.505
- He said it was a dog act

04:25.515 --> 04:26.926
and that you pissed on
the memory of your dad

04:26.933 --> 04:28.845
who used to work there.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.764
He also says you're an
ungrateful bastard

04:30.771 --> 04:31.682
'cause you never thanked him

04:31.688 --> 04:33.805
for coaching you to
AFL standard.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.898
- He has a lot of opinions,
your granddad.

04:35.901 --> 04:38.268
- Did you really break
your leg in nine places?

04:38.278 --> 04:40.144
- Give or take.
- Can I see your scars?

04:40.155 --> 04:40.941
Roll your jeans up.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.397
- Nah, mate, I'd prefer not.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.321
- I can make a doco about you.

04:46.328 --> 04:47.819
- Come on, Neil, we gotta go.

04:47.829 --> 04:48.990
- Hang on, Mum.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.283
Troy Carrington just asked me

04:50.290 --> 04:52.282
to make a documentary about him

04:52.292 --> 04:54.454
and we're workin' out fees.
- I didn't agree to...

04:54.461 --> 04:55.952
Hi, Angie, Troy.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.453
- Hi, I know, hi.

04:57.464 --> 04:58.580
- I thought you knew my
mum and dad.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.582
- We never properly met.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.712
- Then how come you came
to my dad's funeral?

05:02.719 --> 05:04.130
- I was paying my respects.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.301
- A hermit going to a stranger's
funeral is just weird.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.548
- Neil!

05:08.558 --> 05:10.094
Sorry, Troy, I...

05:11.102 --> 05:12.593
Thank you for coming.

05:12.604 --> 05:13.435
I didn't get to say it on
the day,

05:13.438 --> 05:15.350
but I did appreciate
the gesture.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.188
- It's fine.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.602
Sorry, again.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.726
- Private wine tastings?

05:19.736 --> 05:21.318
You're really shit at being
a hermit.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.321
- Neil!

05:24.491 --> 05:26.198
Semillon Shiraz.

05:26.201 --> 05:28.067
- Gee, that's niche.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.740
- I've got a chardonnay
frontignac blend

05:29.746 --> 05:32.784
with a squirt of comquat juice
if you prefer your whites.

05:32.791 --> 05:35.329
- Yeah, we, we'd better
scoot actually, Troy.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.748
We've got a footy club
meeting at the Tin Shed.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.495
- Nana said it was an
extraordinary meeting.

05:39.506 --> 05:40.462
What's that?

05:40.465 --> 05:42.047
- Extraordinary meetings
are meetings

05:42.133 --> 05:43.920
that get called to discuss
the fact that they probably

05:43.927 --> 05:45.964
should have called the meeting
a fair bit earlier.

05:45.971 --> 05:48.133
- Should be the
dictionary definition.

05:48.139 --> 05:49.139
- Come on.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.841
- He's nice for a hermit.

05:56.773 --> 06:00.187
- You can't just force
us into a merger, Geoff!

06:00.193 --> 06:01.650
- What's a merger?

06:01.653 --> 06:03.610
- İt's when one shit team
joins up

06:03.613 --> 06:06.606
with another shit team to make
a slightly less shit team.

06:06.616 --> 06:07.402
- Okay.

06:07.409 --> 06:10.243
- Neville, your club has got
no money,

06:10.245 --> 06:12.988
no players, and no coach.

06:12.998 --> 06:15.706
Your club president didn't
even bother to show up.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.325
- Granddad's in hospital!

06:17.419 --> 06:20.378
- Look, we may have been
able to overlook some issues

06:20.380 --> 06:22.372
but we can't overlook this.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.874
This report arrived on my
desk fellas, and I had to act.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.412
Your club rooms have been found
to be riddled with asbestos.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.889
- What?
- That's really bad.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.633
- Does that mean they'll
be heritage listed?

06:33.643 --> 06:36.852
- No, it means your club
rooms have to come down.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.727
- No!
- That's just bullshit!

06:40.734 --> 06:44.193
- I told Bull this at our
meeting a couple of weeks ago.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.652
- Did Bull tell you about this?

06:45.655 --> 06:48.147
- Is it friable or
non-friable asbestos?

06:48.158 --> 06:50.115
No, it makes a difference if
the particles

06:50.118 --> 06:51.721
are airborne or not,
because if they're air...

06:51.745 --> 06:55.204
- Regardless, you as
a club need to decide:

06:55.206 --> 06:57.573
merge of fold.

07:00.879 --> 07:01.879
- Excuse me!

07:02.756 --> 07:03.872
Can you guys wind this up?

07:03.882 --> 07:05.714
We have the hall booked
from 2:00 pm.

07:07.469 --> 07:08.835
- Why didn't you tell us the
club rooms

07:08.845 --> 07:09.710
were getting knocked down?

07:09.721 --> 07:10.586
- 'Cause it'll never happen.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.010
I'll chain myself to
the rooms if I have to.

07:13.016 --> 07:14.427
- Like the greenies.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.925
- No, not like the
bloody greenies.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.097
- Get into bed, love.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.470
The doctor said you should
avoid getting stressed.

07:19.481 --> 07:20.972
- What's a prostate, Granddad?

07:20.982 --> 07:22.189
- It's a gland up your pooper.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.016
- Granddad's gonna be
fine, Neily.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.610
It's just exploratory
keyhole surgery.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.230
- Why are you having
exploratory keyhole surgery?

07:29.240 --> 07:30.240
- I lost my keys.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.783
So have you found a coach yet?

07:32.786 --> 07:35.620
- No, but Pig Dog
McBride's outta prison.

07:35.622 --> 07:36.783
- Next option?

07:36.790 --> 07:37.871
- Ron Wills?

07:37.874 --> 07:40.582
- Beryl says his tinnitus
is getting worse.

07:40.585 --> 07:41.871
- What's tinnitus?

07:41.878 --> 07:43.790
- That's a hearing
disease that men develop

07:43.797 --> 07:45.754
when they marry people
like Beryl.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.464
- She's not that bad.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.207
- Sorry, love, what was that?

07:48.301 --> 07:50.634
What was that?
- Put that thing out!

07:50.637 --> 07:52.754
- You're the one who told
me I couldn't go outside

07:52.764 --> 07:54.175
in this ensemble.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.889
- Why don't you ask Troy
Carrington to coach?

07:55.892 --> 07:58.760
- Any ex-players on your list
who aren't traitors, Nev?

07:58.770 --> 07:59.726
- Ease up, Bull.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.345
He was best man at my wedding.

08:01.356 --> 08:04.520
- Listen, the coach has
gotta love the club.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.062
I captained-coached two flags,

08:06.069 --> 08:08.436
and one of 'em was with
concussion and a...

08:08.530 --> 08:10.613
- Floating bone in my knee.

08:11.491 --> 08:12.902
- Troy will bring in
new players.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.150
He'll attract sponsors.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.321
- What is it with you wanting
to give

08:15.328 --> 08:18.162
all the local jobs away
to outsiders?

08:18.164 --> 08:19.780
I mean, it's bad enough
that you,

08:19.791 --> 08:23.284
that you're tryin' to give work
to refos ahead of your own.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.081
- Don't start that again.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.205
- What makes you think
that Troy is an outsider?

08:27.215 --> 08:30.083
- He only goes to funerals,
community markets,

08:30.093 --> 08:31.004
and field day.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.344
- Come here when he was
10, left when he was 23.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.678
Not a local.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.014
- So according to the Bull
Barlow Index,

08:37.017 --> 08:38.804
I am also not a local.

08:38.809 --> 08:39.640
- Correct.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.121
Speaking of outsiders, you
didn't bring an ashtray,

08:41.145 --> 08:41.977
did you, Doc?

08:41.980 --> 08:42.811
- Mr. Barlow, I'm gonna have to
ask you

08:42.813 --> 08:44.270
to put that out.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.810
- Ooh.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.517
- Bull!

08:48.528 --> 08:51.191
- They're gonna have to empty
it anyway.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.404
- Mr. Barlow, I'm gonna have to
give you

08:52.407 --> 08:53.989
a full rectal examination.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.197
Have you had trouble
passing stools recently?

08:57.203 --> 08:58.410
- I don't know.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.575
Have you had your
fingernails cut recently?

09:07.714 --> 09:08.714
- Heads!

09:11.968 --> 09:14.301
Interview one for Troy
Carrington documentary.

09:14.304 --> 09:15.966
- Mate, I didn't agree to this.

09:15.972 --> 09:19.340
- Where were you born?
- Gullamunka Inlet.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.216
- Why did you move to
Bodgy Creek?

09:21.227 --> 09:23.184
- When my mum died I
came to live with my dad.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.555
- Which do you prefer?
- Gullamunka Inlet.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.181
- Why don't you live there then?

09:27.192 --> 09:29.400
- My dad left me his house in
his will.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.065
- Can you kick a goal from here?

09:33.239 --> 09:34.239
- Not anymore.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.320
- Krystal from school
reckons they knocked down

09:41.331 --> 09:43.869
the club rooms because it
gave Granddad bum cancer.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.579
- Interesting theory.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.997
- But Mum says he doesn't have
bum cancer.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.916
It's just a dodgy prostate.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.255
- I'd listen to your mum.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.418
- She also said you're a
softcock

09:52.425 --> 09:54.257
'cause you won't coach
the Roosters.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.336
- Maybe only listen to
her sometimes.

10:01.476 --> 10:02.592
- Super Troy leapt off

10:02.602 --> 10:04.764
his giant jet football and
got cracking.

10:05.772 --> 10:09.140
He lined up the foot and
delivered a perfect drop punt

10:09.150 --> 10:12.609
and knocked the chainsaw clean
out of the logger's hands.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.229
"Thanks for saving our
habitat," said Sharon,

10:15.240 --> 10:17.732
the President of the
Koala Union.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.449
All the trees and
creatures cheered

10:19.452 --> 10:22.741
as Super Troy flew off
to his secret hideout.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.912
- What's the chemical
makeup of alpaca saliva?

10:30.922 --> 10:32.914
- It stings a bit?
- Yeah.

10:33.007 --> 10:33.793
- Sorry about that.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.962
- Yeah, Carlos is usually
the one you have to watch.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.336
- Might have to get a
muzzle for Brigita now too.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.507
- Riesling Port.

10:39.514 --> 10:40.800
Is that actually a thing?

10:40.807 --> 10:43.174
- Yeah, the German priests
used to live on it apparently.

10:43.184 --> 10:46.052
The fortified wines keep
better in the tropics.

10:46.062 --> 10:49.521
Now everything is grown here
on the Machu Pichu Estate.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.641
Unfortunately the
generator's running

10:51.651 --> 10:52.937
a little bit low on methane,

10:53.027 --> 10:55.644
so the whites might be
a bit on the warm side.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.942
And I wouldn't touch the
Nectarine Prosecco until the end.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.656
The pulp sticks to your palette.

11:02.787 --> 11:03.948
Got a thirst up, Angie.

11:05.957 --> 11:08.415
- Troy, will you coach the
Roosters?

11:08.418 --> 11:09.249
Yeah, thought so.

11:09.252 --> 11:11.335
See, Neville, it wasn't
that hard.

11:11.337 --> 11:12.828
- Have a wine tasting, he says.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.501
Help a mate out with
his business, he says.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.544
- Well no, yeah, even if
it's just for the season

11:16.551 --> 11:17.917
to get us back on our feet.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.670
- How do you respond
to emotional blackmail?

11:20.680 --> 11:22.262
- Give it your best shot.

11:22.265 --> 11:24.973
- Snapper, Goober, sad faces.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.139
- Not bad.

11:28.146 --> 11:29.146
Rubbish.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.972
Actually quite compelling.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.099
But I think you might
be overstating

11:33.109 --> 11:34.816
my local popularity, Angie.

11:38.823 --> 11:39.939
- Geez.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.739
- Die tree shagger.

11:44.746 --> 11:45.702
Is this written in blood?

11:45.705 --> 11:47.742
- Traytor with a Y.

11:47.749 --> 11:48.705
Uses the wrong your.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.870
Double E, compleet fockwheat.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.164
- I appreciate the offer, Angie,

11:53.171 --> 11:54.707
but as you can tell by my
correspondence,

11:54.714 --> 11:57.047
I'm not really a viable
coaching option.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.007
Highly unlikely to live out
the season.

12:00.178 --> 12:01.419
- Could be food coloring.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.296
- I'm guessing Bull
doesn't know you're here.

12:04.307 --> 12:07.220
- Not if this is anything to
go by.

12:08.519 --> 12:11.387
- Neilo, go long, go
long, go long, go long.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.897
Sorry about that, mate.
- That's okay.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.314
- Thought they'd pulped the
rest of those.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.320
- This is you.

12:24.327 --> 12:25.283
I cannot believe.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.868
- Sayyid, this is Troy.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.863
- Yes, Rooster boy, I
know who this man is.

12:28.873 --> 12:31.160
I read this book in
detention center.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.749
- Really?
- Yes.

12:32.752 --> 12:33.752
I want to read again.

12:35.046 --> 12:38.039
You were number 29, rookie draft
pick 72,

12:38.549 --> 12:40.290
nickname Custard Guts.

12:40.301 --> 12:41.758
- İt never really stuck.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.798
- Not like Town Killer.

12:43.805 --> 12:45.046
- I like this book best.

12:45.056 --> 12:47.469
Players, they talk about
drinking and fighting.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.592
You talk about trees and
hippie mother.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.935
- Do you only read
AFL biographies?

12:51.938 --> 12:54.180
- In Nauru there are
no books, no internets,

12:54.190 --> 12:56.398
so I ask the guard, can I
have book?

12:56.401 --> 12:57.858
He says, "No books!"

12:57.944 --> 13:01.278
I ask different guard,
he says, "No books."

13:01.281 --> 13:03.443
Then one day I go to
recreation room.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.941
Is bad name for this room,
there is nothing to do.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.786
But different guard come in
reading book in front of me.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.075
"Look at me, I have book."

13:11.082 --> 13:14.325
But when he go, he leave book
on chair.

13:14.335 --> 13:16.668
I think this is trick,
but he not come back.

13:16.671 --> 13:19.664
And from then he leave many
books, but always AFL books.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.920
Can I see your scars?

13:22.927 --> 13:23.792
- Won't let ya.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.214
He's weird about 'em.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.337
- Can we kick football?

13:33.938 --> 13:37.306
- Looks like you've done
more than read about footy.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.310
- Yes, I play some days for
detention center guard team.

13:41.571 --> 13:44.814
They a very bad team,
but Sayyid make better.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.283
- Rrright.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.828
It's time for this week in
Bodgy Creek.

13:56.127 --> 13:58.084
Now Angie Barlow has just rung

13:58.087 --> 13:59.328
and apparently no one's
turned up

13:59.339 --> 14:02.127
for the working bee at the
refugee center.

14:02.133 --> 14:03.294
If you're looking for it,

14:03.301 --> 14:04.508
it's just at the old fish and
chip shop.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.423
And just quietly, I reckon
it'd still be in business

14:07.430 --> 14:10.969
if Spiro wasn't so tight
with his minimum chips.

14:12.101 --> 14:15.185
- Bugger, I forgot the vol
Au vents.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.521
- I think we'll be fine, Fran.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.559
- They'll come, love.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.110
- Hey Porterhouse.

14:31.120 --> 14:31.906
- Well done.

14:31.913 --> 14:32.913
- It's Lychees.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.576
- So that's wrong then?

14:38.586 --> 14:40.202
- I know you blokes have
probably just forgotten,

14:40.213 --> 14:42.125
but the working bee at the
refugee center

14:42.131 --> 14:43.417
started about an hour ago

14:43.424 --> 14:46.588
and at this stage, Fran has
significantly over catered.

14:46.594 --> 14:47.425
- I didn't forget.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.385
- That's because I
specifically didn't invite you,

14:49.389 --> 14:50.925
Carpet Burn, because I
knew you'd be too busy

14:50.932 --> 14:52.764
playing with yourself.
- Ouch.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.884
- I'm sorry, Angie, I got
carried away doing this.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.135
I lost track of time.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.229
- And I,

14:58.147 --> 15:00.013
am not good at making
up excuses on the spot.

15:00.024 --> 15:00.889
Let's go, Snaps.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.062
- Yous are actually
goin' to the refo Reno?

15:03.069 --> 15:04.480
- Shut up, Carpet.

15:04.487 --> 15:07.321
- Why have the refos come to
this shit hole for anyway?

15:07.323 --> 15:09.940
- Because this shithole was
chosen as a regional base

15:09.951 --> 15:12.318
to resettle highly skilled
refugees.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.614
Any luck with Pig Dog?

15:13.621 --> 15:15.328
- Nah, he's keen but he's
gotta see

15:15.331 --> 15:16.558
his parole officer
every Saturday

15:16.582 --> 15:18.198
so he can't coach away games.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.075
- Any chance Troy might change
his mind?

15:20.086 --> 15:21.076
- Troy?

15:21.087 --> 15:23.329
You're not seriously gonna
ask the Town Killer are ya?

15:24.715 --> 15:26.206
Wha...

15:30.221 --> 15:31.221
- Oops.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.340
- Umm

15:34.350 --> 15:35.215
- Snapper, Goober.

15:35.226 --> 15:37.263
- You owe me two bucks.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.775
- Interview two
with Troy Carrington.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.610
- What are you doing here?
- I just told you.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.945
- How'd you know where I lived?

15:48.948 --> 15:50.780
- Everyone knows where you live.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.365
- Mate, you can't just drop in
like this.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.951
- Question one, if your mum
was an environmentalist,

15:54.954 --> 15:57.241
how come she married a
timber worker?

15:57.248 --> 15:59.114
- They never married.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.491
It was a summer fling.

16:00.501 --> 16:01.912
- So you're a bastard then.

16:02.003 --> 16:03.210
- Does your mum know
you're here?

16:03.212 --> 16:04.248
- Bum, I forgot!

16:04.255 --> 16:05.621
She's gonna be talking on
the radio.

16:05.631 --> 16:06.667
- What about?

16:06.674 --> 16:08.256
- The refos, ugees.

16:11.262 --> 16:14.130
- Our guest here
today is Angie Barlow.

16:14.140 --> 16:14.971
Welcome, Angie.

16:14.974 --> 16:18.467
Now, what was your
university field of study?

16:18.478 --> 16:19.594
- Arts, law.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.015
But I didn't finish.

16:21.022 --> 16:23.264
I got a graduate diploma
in having

16:23.274 --> 16:25.641
an unplanned kid instead.

16:25.651 --> 16:26.482
- That's me.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.148
- Now there
are critics out there

16:28.154 --> 16:31.238
who think the refugee center
shouldn't be there at all.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.781
What do say to them?

16:32.783 --> 16:33.694
- Warwick, we're just,

16:33.701 --> 16:36.159
we're just trying to help
people in need.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.280
When I lost my husband, Brett,

16:39.290 --> 16:41.122
I had people rallying to me.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.742
I had complete strangers
dropping meals off

16:43.753 --> 16:46.416
on my doorstep because
that's what communities do.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.288
They help one another.

16:48.299 --> 16:51.042
And we need to see the
world as a community.

16:51.052 --> 16:53.715
I mean, there's no point
just sitting around

16:53.721 --> 16:55.303
feeling sorry for yourself,

16:55.306 --> 16:57.172
not when there's people out
there that might need you.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.300
- She's got a fair head on
her shoulders, your mum.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.680
- Speaking of sorry causes,

17:01.687 --> 17:03.804
any news on a new Roosters
coach?

17:03.814 --> 17:04.849
There's a rumor going around

17:04.857 --> 17:07.691
that Troy Carrington might be in
the mix.

17:07.693 --> 17:08.854
- That's you.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.898
- Yeah, well, we did talk to
him, but,

17:11.906 --> 17:14.022
I don't know, it's pretty hard
to hear

17:14.032 --> 17:15.773
when you got your head
shoved halfway up your a...

17:15.785 --> 17:18.367
- Rrright, well,
we might go to another song.

17:18.371 --> 17:21.284
Here's Big Jim Carswell's Pig
Skin Rodeo.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.547
- Vanilla slice.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.167
Also, a snot block, yes?

17:33.177 --> 17:34.177
- Yep.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.378
- Lamington, yes?
- Yep.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.051
- New Zealand cake but
Australia steal

17:38.057 --> 17:39.673
and say Australia cake.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.220
- Nah, they're Australian.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.388
- Like Russell Crowe.

17:42.395 --> 17:43.602
- You know your cakes.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.057
Troy, I'm making
Sayyid's English gooder.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.726
Check this out.

17:50.736 --> 17:51.772
What's that one?

17:51.779 --> 17:52.895
- Neenish tart.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.692
- And that?
- Bee sting.

17:54.699 --> 17:58.067
- This should be the
Australian citizenship test.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.705
- Crap company you're
keeping, Neil.

18:04.709 --> 18:06.120
- Who's this bloke?

18:06.127 --> 18:07.538
- Carpet Burn.

18:07.545 --> 18:10.413
Good footballer, massive tool.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.086
- Hey, I wouldn't stand
that close to the refo.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.129
Nah, he's probably got a
bomb strapped to his body.

18:15.136 --> 18:16.627
- Keep your ignorant,
racist comments

18:16.637 --> 18:17.844
to yourself, mate.

18:17.847 --> 18:19.509
- I don't take
advice from town killers

18:19.515 --> 18:20.847
who hang around with Isis.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.389
Come on, mate, come on!

18:30.985 --> 18:32.101
- Fair tank on him.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.353
- Play him in the midfield,
you reckon?

18:34.363 --> 18:36.821
- I would, if I was coach.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.561
- Yeah, okay, okay,
okay, let's just settle.

19:15.571 --> 19:16.436
Look, look, I'm sorry Bull,

19:16.447 --> 19:18.154
but if you had given us
the heads up

19:18.157 --> 19:20.149
on the club rooms, we
wouldn't be in this position.

19:20.159 --> 19:20.899
- Bullshit.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.151
They can knock down our rooms,

19:22.161 --> 19:24.323
they can't stop us playing.

19:25.790 --> 19:28.328
My son was the last decent
coach this team had.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.752
He's gone now, but I'll
tell you this for nothing.

19:33.339 --> 19:36.173
This club will not be merged
or disbanded

19:36.175 --> 19:37.586
while I still breathe.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.422
- Then what's your plan, Bull?

19:40.429 --> 19:41.215
- I told you.

19:41.222 --> 19:43.009
See, the community will
get behind

19:43.015 --> 19:45.849
our various fundraising events.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.843
- Yes, some of the world's
most fragile economies

19:47.853 --> 19:50.186
have been turned around
by a meat tray raffle.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.520
- Do you mind if I put
in my two bobs worth?

19:54.527 --> 19:56.018
- Town Killer!

19:56.028 --> 19:58.236
- Neville, tell your
shithouse best mate

19:58.239 --> 19:59.775
it's financial members only.

19:59.782 --> 20:01.193
- He paid up this morning, Bull.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.316
- I don't care, get him out
of here.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.783
- Well, look, you made the
rules, okay.

20:03.786 --> 20:04.822
He's paid up.

20:04.829 --> 20:06.991
He has every right to stay.

20:06.997 --> 20:09.364
- Goober, Snapper, do you
mind handing these out?

20:10.376 --> 20:12.868
Now I focused on the
club's micro problems.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.370
Your micro problems are
no money, no club rooms,

20:17.216 --> 20:20.050
not enough players, threat
of expulsion.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.214
Macro problem bein'
you're rooted.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.507
- Did you put him up to this?

20:23.514 --> 20:24.379
- No.

20:24.390 --> 20:27.224
- Now, I focused on one
specific micro problem,

20:27.226 --> 20:28.216
the club rooms.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.516
And according to the Asbestos
Act of 2012,

20:31.522 --> 20:34.230
all buildings built prior
to 1996 are eligible

20:34.233 --> 20:36.566
for rebuilding grants, and
I've checked and you are.

20:36.569 --> 20:37.849
And Angie, I hope you don't mind

20:37.903 --> 20:39.360
but I've done a little bit
of homework

20:39.363 --> 20:41.400
and I've found that you can
get triple

20:41.407 --> 20:43.524
maybe even quadruple
your funding

20:43.534 --> 20:46.026
by accessing grants for employing
refugees for the rebuild.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.747
- What good are club rooms
if we don't have a team?

20:50.750 --> 20:52.036
- Have a think about it, mate.

20:52.042 --> 20:52.998
If those blokes can swing
a hammer,

20:53.002 --> 20:54.914
I reckon they can kick a footy,
yeah?

20:55.880 --> 20:59.373
And, we'll turn the club
rooms into a community hub

20:59.383 --> 21:00.874
that everyone can use.

21:00.885 --> 21:02.592
- This is really good.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.008
- You've got a bloody
hide coming in here, Troy.

21:05.014 --> 21:06.380
He shuts down our mill,

21:06.390 --> 21:08.256
and now he wants to give
jobs away

21:08.267 --> 21:10.554
to refos who haven't
been here two minutes!

21:11.437 --> 21:12.302
- And you'll coach?

21:12.313 --> 21:14.100
- He bloody well won't.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.938
- If the offer still stands,
Angie.

21:15.941 --> 21:16.772
- Let's vote on it.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.267
- That's a committee decision.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.108
- Well no, hang on.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.854
Let's just canvas and see
the level of interest, okay?

21:21.864 --> 21:24.277
All those in favor of Troy's
rescue plan?

21:26.452 --> 21:27.283
The yes has it.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.824
- Have you, you done
lost your bloody minds?

21:29.830 --> 21:32.322
This bloke hasn't darkened
the doorstep

21:32.333 --> 21:34.290
of our club since he left
the place.

21:34.293 --> 21:37.036
- He's offering us a viable
means of survival, Bull.

21:37.046 --> 21:38.046
- İs he?

21:39.131 --> 21:42.169
All right then, it's him or me.

21:43.594 --> 21:44.755
Take your pick.

21:44.762 --> 21:46.970
- The club and the town
that you used to know

21:46.972 --> 21:48.588
don't exist anymore.

21:48.599 --> 21:49.589
They're long gone.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.593
This, this is brilliant
for everyone.

21:52.603 --> 21:53.889
- Him or me.

21:53.896 --> 21:54.727
Take a vote.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.141
- Come on Bull, we can't
vote on...

21:56.148 --> 21:57.605
- Vote, vote.

21:57.608 --> 21:58.974
- Jesus, all right, okay.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.606
All those in favor of Bull.

22:02.613 --> 22:04.570
- Bull.

22:05.491 --> 22:06.948
- And Troy?

22:06.951 --> 22:08.317
- Troy!

22:17.211 --> 22:18.793
- Fine.

22:18.796 --> 22:20.503
- Come on, mate.
- No, Grandpa.

22:20.506 --> 22:21.917
- Bull.

22:26.136 --> 22:28.344
- Are you guys nearly done?

22:28.347 --> 22:29.963
We've got this place booked
from six,

22:29.974 --> 22:32.512
and it takes us a while to
set up our siege engine.

22:41.026 --> 22:43.643
- Interview four for Troy
Carrington documentary.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.605
How do you respond to claims
from Krystal

22:46.615 --> 22:49.653
from Bodgy Creek Primary
School that you're a flog?

22:49.660 --> 22:50.901
- I don't really know what a
flog is,

22:50.911 --> 22:51.867
but it doesn't sound good.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.362
- I think it's worse than
a wanker

22:53.372 --> 22:55.364
but not as bad as a dickhead.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.374
- Good to know.

22:57.418 --> 23:00.536
- Are you only coaching 'cause
Mum publicly humiliated you

23:00.546 --> 23:01.377
to the whole world?

23:01.380 --> 23:03.497
- I think you're overstating
the reach

23:03.507 --> 23:05.373
of the Bodgy Creek
Community Radio Station,

23:05.384 --> 23:07.797
but yeah, she was right
about the proximity

23:07.803 --> 23:09.544
of my head in relation to
my ass.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.512
The refugees need our
help and we need theirs.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.381
It's a win-win.

23:17.271 --> 23:18.557
Gidday, mate.

23:18.564 --> 23:19.930
I'm Troy Carrington, this
is Neil.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.147
We're from the local footy club.

23:21.150 --> 23:22.516
We're just wondering
if you'd be interested

23:22.526 --> 23:23.983
in coming to training.

23:23.986 --> 23:25.852
Sorry, mate, how's your English?

23:25.863 --> 23:27.399
- English okay.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.738
Australian not so good.

23:30.159 --> 23:31.821
This is a football, yes?
- Yeah.

23:33.662 --> 23:34.662
- I know this game.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.578
- Is that a yes or a no?

23:42.087 --> 23:44.454
- I am very unfamiliar with
this game.

23:44.465 --> 23:45.922
- Well, with a handball you just
hold it

23:45.925 --> 23:47.416
in the palm of your hand

23:47.426 --> 23:49.106
and then you just punch
it below the point.

23:53.599 --> 23:54.599
- Thank you!

23:59.063 --> 24:00.144
- Good hands.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.899
- I like Troyism chapter best.

24:04.902 --> 24:07.770
The pathway to enlightenment
is down the guts!

24:07.780 --> 24:11.069
And my favorite, keep doing
it until

24:11.075 --> 24:12.907
you are not shit.
- You are not shit.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.453
- Signed copy of Crepe Career

24:18.624 --> 24:20.911
go straight into Sayid's office.

24:20.918 --> 24:21.918
- So you'll play?

24:24.171 --> 24:26.458
- Yes, I will play.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.458
Your team needs Sayyid
or they will be bad team.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.959
- Is that your family?

24:30.970 --> 24:33.587
- No, this was already
on wall when I come here.

24:33.597 --> 24:34.804
Of course this is my family!

24:34.807 --> 24:35.888
What do you think, Sayyid
creepy man

24:35.891 --> 24:37.473
put photo of strangers on walls?

24:44.358 --> 24:46.896
- How long since you've
seen them?

24:46.902 --> 24:48.894
- For now, six years.

24:50.030 --> 24:52.067
Took three years before
Australian government

24:52.074 --> 24:54.908
say yes, you are real refugee
from Syrian Civil War.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.822
They are stupid people.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.912
But then, because No
Advantage Policy,

24:58.914 --> 25:01.031
I must wait the same
time to bring my family.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.041
Three more years.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.002
They come here soon.

25:05.671 --> 25:09.130
This is wife, Fazela, and
daughter, Sima.

25:09.133 --> 25:11.045
She was only four when I see
her last.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.667
- She's hot.

25:12.678 --> 25:14.510
- When they come here soon, if
Rooster boy

25:14.513 --> 25:17.051
touches my daughter, I maybe
kick him in tiny balls.

25:17.057 --> 25:18.639
- Ease up, Sayyid, I'm only 10.

25:23.689 --> 25:24.689
- This is Mother.

25:26.150 --> 25:27.150
- And your father?

25:28.235 --> 25:29.692
- He was killed in civil war.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.280
- Sorry, mate.

25:36.118 --> 25:37.404
- Who's the little guy?

25:37.411 --> 25:39.869
- This is brother, Ammad.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.034
When civil war begin we live
in Alleppo

25:42.041 --> 25:44.328
but rebels move into our suburb.

25:44.334 --> 25:46.417
We are not rebels but
Assad government troops

25:46.420 --> 25:48.787
try to arrest us, so we
must escape.

25:48.797 --> 25:52.006
I take Fazela and Sima to
refugee camp in Turkey.

25:52.009 --> 25:53.875
Mother would not leave.

25:53.886 --> 25:56.299
Then Ammad and Sayyid
try to come to Australia

25:56.305 --> 25:57.637
where uncle he live.

25:57.723 --> 26:00.386
Then we hope to bring
all family here, safe.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.557
After very long time we
get to Christmas Island

26:04.563 --> 26:07.397
together on boat, then
to Nauru, hot shit place.

26:09.693 --> 26:12.231
And then one day Australian
government man come and say,

26:12.237 --> 26:15.230
you are economic refugee,
not real refugee.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.240
You go home.

26:17.159 --> 26:19.822
Our home is gone, bombed.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.992
So I say no, but Ammad, he
feel bad

26:22.998 --> 26:24.864
about leaving mother alone so he
go home,

26:24.875 --> 26:25.911
like a baby mummy boy.

26:29.421 --> 26:30.421
I joke.

26:33.217 --> 26:34.217
I love my brother.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.423
- Well, I was thinking I
could open

26:38.430 --> 26:40.638
a traditional Bharatanyatyam
dance school,

26:40.641 --> 26:43.725
if there isn't already one in
Bodgy Creek.

26:43.727 --> 26:44.727
- Right.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.599
- I'm joking, Ms. Angie!

26:49.608 --> 26:53.022
- It looks like we've got
a new project manager.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.018
- Really?

26:54.029 --> 26:54.894
That's handy.

26:54.905 --> 26:56.191
- Um, and a Bharatanyatyam
dancer.

26:56.198 --> 26:58.155
- Could be handy.

26:58.158 --> 27:00.901
- Suresh, Navina, this is
Troy Carrington,

27:00.911 --> 27:02.152
the new coach of our footy club.

27:02.162 --> 27:04.404
And this is my son, Neil.

27:04.498 --> 27:06.160
- So you're a civil engineer?

27:06.166 --> 27:08.032
- Kandi University with honors.

27:08.043 --> 27:11.502
My Sinhalese husband was a
sought-after project manager

27:11.505 --> 27:13.622
until he made the
questionable career choice

27:13.632 --> 27:14.418
of marrying a Tamil.

27:14.424 --> 27:16.666
- Hey, best decision I
ever made.

27:16.677 --> 27:17.633
- Well, since you're here,

27:17.636 --> 27:19.923
might as well play for the
footy team.

27:19.930 --> 27:20.795
- Footy?

27:20.806 --> 27:21.717
- It's a sport.

27:21.807 --> 27:24.094
- Ooh, sport is not really
my strength.

27:24.101 --> 27:25.933
- He's being modest.

27:25.936 --> 27:28.053
Suresh was a Roman
Greco Wrestling champion

27:28.063 --> 27:29.349
at our university.

27:29.356 --> 27:31.643
- Well, there's not many
Roman Grecos around here,

27:31.650 --> 27:34.358
but we could use a
tackling coach.

27:34.361 --> 27:37.069
I'll see you at training
tomorrow night.

27:37.072 --> 27:38.529
- Tackling's fun.

27:40.242 --> 27:41.983
- Yep, that's it.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.326
Yeah.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.328
- How's it going?

27:45.330 --> 27:46.330
- Not great.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.956
School Shoes has already done
a hammy.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.205
- Nice work, Didier.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.333
- Granddad was right.

27:54.339 --> 27:57.082
You can bugger up a team that
hasn't won in three years.

27:57.968 --> 28:00.255
Some of 'em are making Snapper
look good.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.976
- Nah, mate, you can't do
that either.

28:08.979 --> 28:09.979
- Snaps!

28:14.109 --> 28:15.395
- Woo!

28:15.402 --> 28:17.234
Carpet, burns him!

28:18.155 --> 28:18.986
Burns him!

28:18.989 --> 28:20.105
Ooh ho ho ho!

28:20.115 --> 28:21.697
He's off into the...

28:22.993 --> 28:23.858
Ease up, Sultana.

28:23.869 --> 28:26.452
- My name is Sayyid,
not small dried fruit.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.367
- All right, everyone in!

28:28.373 --> 28:29.204
Come on.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.289
Now boys, the match practice
has given me

28:30.292 --> 28:32.784
a fair idea of where you're at
individually and as a group.

28:32.878 --> 28:35.120
Harpo, mate, you're the
size of a small town.

28:35.130 --> 28:36.462
Don't be afraid to use your bulk

28:36.465 --> 28:38.548
in the ruck contest, all right?

28:38.550 --> 28:39.461
Those sketches aren't bad.

28:39.468 --> 28:41.585
You got a big of the
Flemish master's influence

28:41.595 --> 28:42.711
in your portraiture.

28:42.721 --> 28:43.586
- Yeah, cheers.

28:43.597 --> 28:45.008
It's part of a triptych.

28:45.015 --> 28:46.597
Wanna to see the others?

28:46.600 --> 28:48.683
- Maybe a bit later?

28:48.769 --> 28:51.728
Tou, when you go over the
boundary, you're out of play.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.892
If you go over the fence,
you're a spectator, all right?

28:53.899 --> 28:57.142
So it's a general rule, try
and keep inside both of those.

28:57.152 --> 28:58.734
- Yes, Mr. Troy.

28:58.737 --> 28:59.727
- Porterhouse.

28:59.738 --> 29:00.728
- Well done.

29:00.739 --> 29:01.900
- You gotta a pair of
boots, mate?

29:01.907 --> 29:03.864
'Cause you're havin' trouble
keepin' your feet in those.

29:03.867 --> 29:06.234
- Sorry, I got a shift at
the pub after training.

29:07.537 --> 29:09.028
- It's been lovely having you
here, Stan.

29:09.039 --> 29:11.031
We might get you back to
the nursing home now, yeah?

29:11.041 --> 29:12.157
- I'll take him.

29:13.043 --> 29:15.000
- İt's from my mother in Syria.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.995
- Yeah, yeah, not a
problem, mate.

29:17.005 --> 29:18.462
- Where's Syria?

29:18.465 --> 29:20.923
- Do you know where Turkey is?

29:20.926 --> 29:21.757
- Nah.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.217
- Do you know where Iraq is?

29:23.303 --> 29:24.089
- Nah.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.462
- It's between them.

29:25.472 --> 29:26.303
- Righto, let's finish off

29:26.306 --> 29:28.593
with the mime handball
drill we did earlier.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.593
Now remember to visualize
and commit

29:31.603 --> 29:33.310
to the dramatic conceit.

29:33.313 --> 29:34.178
Goober, take 'em out.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.305
All right boys, go.

29:35.315 --> 29:37.307
- Come on, boys, let's go!
- Okay, this is happenin'.

29:37.317 --> 29:38.558
- Port, Port, Port!

29:40.404 --> 29:41.360
- Good hands, Snapper!

29:41.363 --> 29:43.070
- Nice work, nice work.
- Yeah, that's it, that's it.

29:43.073 --> 29:45.440
- I think I'm better at
mime footy.

29:45.450 --> 29:48.943
- No argument from me.

29:48.954 --> 29:50.411
- This is bullshit.

29:50.414 --> 29:51.414
Troy's a nut job.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.296
- I'll get it!

30:00.257 --> 30:01.793
- Decent roost there, Carpets.

30:06.930 --> 30:09.673
- It's time for
this week in Bodgy Creek.

30:09.683 --> 30:13.051
Right wing conservative
bush poet, Bruce Nation,

30:13.061 --> 30:15.144
will be at the Bodgy Creek
Bowls Club on Saturday night

30:15.147 --> 30:17.434
where he'll be launching his
new book,

30:17.441 --> 30:20.229
Teeny Weenie Poofter Greenie, so
be sure...

30:20.235 --> 30:22.101
- Where the bloody hell are
you goin'?

30:22.112 --> 30:24.104
- Bataratamy dancing
with Navina.

30:24.114 --> 30:25.230
- Sorry I asked.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.240
- What do you think?

30:27.659 --> 30:29.150
It's just a bit of harmless fun.

30:29.161 --> 30:29.992
- İs it?

30:29.995 --> 30:30.985
Look at ya.

30:30.996 --> 30:33.238
That lot are trying to
change the way we live.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.833
- Sorry we're early.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.004
This one couldn't wait.

30:48.889 --> 30:50.005
- What'd you think?

30:50.015 --> 30:51.881
- I liked the one where
Troy sticks footies

30:51.892 --> 30:53.679
on the harpoons to stop
the Japanese

30:53.685 --> 30:55.847
from researching any more whales
to death.

30:55.854 --> 30:56.854
- Yeah, me too.

30:58.690 --> 30:59.646
- Enough small talk.

30:59.649 --> 31:01.140
Let's get this joint
interview happening.

31:01.151 --> 31:03.188
I need you guys in a two shot.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.321
Interview number seven with
new Rooster's president

31:07.324 --> 31:10.613
and coach, Angie Barlow
and Troy Carrington.

31:10.619 --> 31:12.736
Angie Barlow, how do
you respond to comments

31:12.746 --> 31:14.282
from former president Grandad

31:14.289 --> 31:15.871
that you wouldn't know
how to run a footy club

31:15.874 --> 31:17.490
if it bit you on the ass?

31:17.501 --> 31:19.333
- That doesn't even make sense.

31:19.336 --> 31:22.500
- And Troy, how do you
respond to Grandad's claims

31:22.506 --> 31:24.873
that after your footy
career you did stuff all

31:24.883 --> 31:27.500
until you started buggering
up this town for a living?

31:27.594 --> 31:29.756
- Stuff all's a bit harsh.

31:29.763 --> 31:31.629
But yeah, things were a
bit slow.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.302
After I got my insurance payout,

31:33.308 --> 31:35.348
I set up a Eco-consultancy
business for footy clubs,

31:37.229 --> 31:39.312
but Carbon Footy Print
never really panned out.

31:41.149 --> 31:42.560
- You did not call it that.

31:42.567 --> 31:43.567
- I did.

31:45.654 --> 31:46.485
- And then I got a job

31:46.488 --> 31:48.650
workin' at a mate's
biodynamic winery.

31:48.657 --> 31:50.398
Biodynamics is all about
the interrelationship

31:50.409 --> 31:52.196
between soil, livestock...

31:52.202 --> 31:53.909
- Can I play with the alpacas?

31:54.913 --> 31:56.324
- Yeah, sure.

31:56.331 --> 31:57.492
- They get agro.

31:57.499 --> 31:59.912
- I know, that's why
I wanna play with 'em.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.160
- Keep away from the white one.

32:02.170 --> 32:03.786
Brigita's had a bad week.

32:03.797 --> 32:06.164
(alpacas humming

32:06.174 --> 32:09.042
- I should show you this.

32:10.720 --> 32:11.720
There.

32:15.183 --> 32:17.391
Super Troy lives on.

32:17.394 --> 32:19.727
- Albeit with a
spectacular mullet.

32:19.729 --> 32:22.642
- He drew it
from your old footy cards.

32:23.942 --> 32:26.935
I kinda like you with a mullet.

32:30.490 --> 32:32.948
- Yeah, my first thought was,

32:32.951 --> 32:34.067
and she's been gone for
36 years,

32:34.077 --> 32:35.284
but I wanted to show Mum.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.821
- She sounds so lovely.

32:41.710 --> 32:43.292
Um, thank you.

32:45.213 --> 32:47.500
Thank you for doing this
doco thing with him.

32:47.507 --> 32:48.964
- İt's no drama.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.128
- No, it's kind.

32:51.970 --> 32:54.212
He got the camera and the
Rooster's onsie

32:54.222 --> 32:56.134
off Brett the Christmas
before he died.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.012
He doesn't talk about him much

32:59.019 --> 33:00.305
but he's obsessed with
that camera

33:00.312 --> 33:02.144
and he won't wear anything else.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.981
His filming gives him a kind
of focus.

33:10.864 --> 33:13.982
- Mate, do you wanna put
that back in the shed for me?

33:18.038 --> 33:20.325
- And your email address as
well, Glenda,

33:20.332 --> 33:23.416
so we can send any details
of protests.

33:23.418 --> 33:26.001
- Is there a limit on how
many times I can sign this?

33:27.255 --> 33:28.041
- Cheeky.

33:28.048 --> 33:29.038
- I mean, honestly.

33:29.049 --> 33:32.338
I had a refugee apply for
a market stall last week.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.710
Could barely read a word of it.

33:33.720 --> 33:36.087
I mean, if you wanna live in
this country,

33:36.181 --> 33:37.297
learn the language.

33:37.307 --> 33:39.048
Is that too much to arks?

33:39.059 --> 33:40.846
- In total agreement, Glenda.

33:48.902 --> 33:50.018
- Do you have to do that
right here?

33:50.028 --> 33:50.859
- Free county.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.024
They even let back-stabbing
daughters-in-law

33:53.031 --> 33:55.023
run footy clubs around here.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.365
- Well, would you do your
back-stabbing

33:56.368 --> 33:58.280
daughter-in-law a favor
and take your grandson

33:58.286 --> 33:59.493
to swimming lessons please?

33:59.496 --> 34:00.327
- Can't he swim yet?

34:00.330 --> 34:02.822
He's been going there
half his bloody life.

34:02.832 --> 34:04.118
Yeah, yeah, no worries.

34:04.209 --> 34:05.209
- Thank you.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.036
- You beauty!

34:08.045 --> 34:10.663
Hello there, welcome to
Bodgy Creek.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.715
- So, minaret on
top of the scoreboard.

34:16.721 --> 34:18.882
What about the prayer room?

34:18.889 --> 34:21.757
- I think the prayer room
should go on this side.

34:21.768 --> 34:22.804
- Why's that?

34:22.811 --> 34:24.598
- Because it will be
closer to the scoreboard

34:24.603 --> 34:27.312
where the minaret for
call to prayer will be.

34:27.315 --> 34:28.304
- Makes sense.

34:28.315 --> 34:29.681
What about the bar?

34:29.693 --> 34:31.400
- You spend long time in
bouncy house.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.735
Sayyid enter now.

34:33.737 --> 34:36.481
- Everyone, can I get
your attention thanks?

34:36.491 --> 34:39.484
Now we've organized a
bit of a Rooster Kringle.

34:39.494 --> 34:41.734
This is a club tradition that
dates back to, when, Angie?

34:43.248 --> 34:44.112
- Late last week.

34:44.123 --> 34:45.239
- And still going strong.

34:45.250 --> 34:46.786
Each of the current players

34:46.793 --> 34:48.079
have to pick a name outta
the hat

34:48.085 --> 34:50.418
and organize a welcome
gift for the new fellas.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.379
Let's start with Goober.

34:56.886 --> 34:59.879
- This is for Tou Pou.
- Nice one, Goobs.

34:59.889 --> 35:01.130
Tou, if that thing was any
more Australian

35:01.141 --> 35:02.427
it wouldn't know the
words to the second verse

35:02.434 --> 35:04.346
of the National Anthem.

35:04.352 --> 35:05.638
- No, no, no, no, mate.

35:05.645 --> 35:08.103
It's a totem tennis.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.393
Like that.

35:10.400 --> 35:11.400
- I understand.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.778
- Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:15.780 --> 35:16.861
- I'll show you later.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.778
- Porterhouse.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.400
- Well done.

35:21.411 --> 35:22.947
- You had Didier.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.124
- Aww.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.829
- I read on the internet
you guys

35:29.836 --> 35:31.122
like goats or somethin'.

35:34.299 --> 35:35.299
- Thank you.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.839
- Troy, I wasn't here when
you read out the names,

35:39.846 --> 35:42.429
so I just made everyone some
Bodgy Creek Stump Snow Dones.

35:45.185 --> 35:46.016
- Thank you.

35:46.019 --> 35:46.850
- It's okay.

35:46.853 --> 35:48.139
Here you go.
- Thank you.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.762
- Here you go, Didier.

35:49.773 --> 35:51.639
- What is fluid compound?

35:51.650 --> 35:52.731
Glycol?

35:52.734 --> 35:54.145
- Yeah, how'd you know that?

35:54.152 --> 35:55.768
- I was a chemist in Burindi.

35:55.779 --> 35:58.442
- Did you come from
Burindi to get a better job?

35:58.448 --> 36:01.156
- No, because the police
shot at my brother and I.

36:01.242 --> 36:02.574
They thought we were rebels.

36:03.662 --> 36:04.948
- So not for work then?

36:04.954 --> 36:05.944
- No.

36:05.955 --> 36:08.698
- Harpo, you had Suresh.

36:20.345 --> 36:21.506
- It's an esky fountain.

36:23.515 --> 36:24.847
It's art.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.182
Ooh.

36:34.526 --> 36:35.812
- My turn.

36:36.653 --> 36:38.861
Okay, I had Sayyid.

36:38.863 --> 36:39.863
Here you go, pal.

36:44.953 --> 36:47.195
Anyone want a beer while I'm up?

36:49.749 --> 36:50.990
- Thank you.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.494
- Good luck to the Roosters

36:54.504 --> 36:56.211
who are taking on the
Hudson's Flat Cougars today

36:56.214 --> 36:58.627
in the first match of
the season.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.670
Haven't had this much trouble
getting my head around names

37:00.677 --> 37:03.385
since Marjorie came home
with an IKEA catalog.

37:04.514 --> 37:06.631
I reckon they'd be just about
getting ready as we speak

37:06.641 --> 37:09.008
in the Rooster's new look
club rooms slash tent.

37:09.936 --> 37:11.222
And well done to Gretchen
for providing

37:11.229 --> 37:13.016
that temporary arrangement.

37:13.022 --> 37:14.022
- Next!

37:14.691 --> 37:15.691
- Harps.

37:20.113 --> 37:21.399
Sorry, Snapper.

37:23.992 --> 37:25.733
- Looking good, Stan.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.740
- This is a first.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.830
We've run out of jumpers.

37:32.751 --> 37:35.243
- Granddad's not happy
you're movin' in next door.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.994
- He not like refugees?

37:37.005 --> 37:37.836
- Hates 'em.

37:37.839 --> 37:40.377
Even more than vegans, but
not as much as greenies.

37:41.301 --> 37:43.088
- Tell Mr. Granddad,
Sayyid need bigger house

37:43.094 --> 37:45.256
for family he has not seen
in six years

37:45.263 --> 37:46.799
so he must keep being not happy.

37:50.393 --> 37:52.259
- Local jobs for locals!

37:52.270 --> 37:53.681
No jobs for refos!

37:53.688 --> 37:55.554
Local jobs for locals!

37:55.565 --> 37:56.976
No jobs for refos!

37:56.983 --> 37:58.269
- You were right, Snapper,

37:58.276 --> 38:00.313
my mum does have
impeccable handwriting.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.686
- Come on, boys, back inside.

38:01.696 --> 38:02.937
Come on, come on, come on!

38:05.158 --> 38:06.274
Grab a possie, fellas.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.276
Don't worry about all of that.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.448
- What happen if they
get violent?

38:10.455 --> 38:11.741
- You'll be all right, mate.

38:11.748 --> 38:12.909
- I didn't expect this
to happen.

38:12.916 --> 38:15.158
- They're just blowin' out
hot air, boys, all right?

38:15.168 --> 38:17.034
There's just some people
out there

38:17.045 --> 38:18.581
who don't like what we're
doin' here.

38:18.588 --> 38:20.079
- What are we doing here?

38:20.089 --> 38:21.671
- We're rebuildin' the
footy club.

38:21.758 --> 38:24.296
- This isn't a
club, it's a joke, mate.

38:25.345 --> 38:26.711
- Then why are you wearing this?

38:26.721 --> 38:27.632
'Cause you wanna play.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.301
And the only way that's
gonna happen

38:29.307 --> 38:31.594
is if you embrace these
blokes as your teammates.

38:31.601 --> 38:32.967
- Footy shouldn't be this hard.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.310
- Mate, this isn't hard.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.145
What's the hardest thing
you've ever had to do?

38:37.148 --> 38:38.730
- Probably year 11.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.065
- What about you, Suresh?

38:40.068 --> 38:41.775
- It is difficult to narrow
it down

38:41.861 --> 38:43.944
due to the cataclysmic
events of the civil war,

38:43.947 --> 38:47.031
but as a life challenge
it is hard to surpass

38:47.033 --> 38:49.776
the constant stream of death
threats from both sides

38:49.786 --> 38:51.573
after I became betrothed
to Navina.

38:52.580 --> 38:53.741
- That kinda hard.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.990
No, I had some guinea pigs that
died, but nothin' like that.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Sorry, Suresh.

38:58.378 --> 39:00.791
What's the hardest thing you've
had to do?

39:00.797 --> 39:03.130
- Stop feelin' sorry for myself.

39:03.132 --> 39:05.465
It's pretty hard to do with
your head stuck up your ass.

39:07.512 --> 39:08.923
I thought the world owed
me something.

39:08.930 --> 39:09.761
It didn't.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.676
I crawled out from under my log

39:11.683 --> 39:14.676
and I found you blokes,
and here we bloody are.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.097
- Yeah!
- Yes.

39:16.104 --> 39:18.596
- We're gonna play against
two oppositions today.

39:18.606 --> 39:20.848
The first one you're gonna
beat when you run out there.

39:20.859 --> 39:21.849
- Yeah!

39:21.860 --> 39:23.226
- And you can break the
second one

39:23.236 --> 39:24.477
after the balls bounce!

39:24.571 --> 39:25.357
- Yes!

39:25.363 --> 39:28.151
- So Goober, bloody lead 'em
out there

39:28.157 --> 39:30.023
and smile at your mum as you
run past.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.987
- Local jobs for locals.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.534
No jobs for refos.

39:39.878 --> 39:40.994
- Hey, Mum.

39:41.004 --> 39:43.792
Can I bring the boys
over for dinner tonight?

39:43.798 --> 39:45.039
- Fat chance!

39:45.049 --> 39:47.632
- No jobs for refos
- On the run, boys!

39:47.635 --> 39:48.842
- Local jobs for locals.

39:48.845 --> 39:50.256
No jobs for refos.

Hudson Flat, free kick.

40:48.863 --> 40:50.320
- Why is this a free kick?

40:50.323 --> 40:53.282
- Because you can't do whatever
that is.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.446

- Good work.

41:31.114 --> 41:33.606

once said,

41:33.616 --> 41:34.777
a big loss is part of
the journey.

41:34.784 --> 41:37.071
It's a shit part of the journey
but it's a part nonetheless.

41:37.078 --> 41:39.035
Now I want you to get into a
tight circle.

41:39.038 --> 41:41.030
We're gonna sing the team song,

41:41.040 --> 41:42.497

41:42.500 --> 41:43.980

team spirits

None of us know the words to

41:49.924 --> 41:51.506
We haven't sang it in
three years.

41:51.509 --> 41:54.252
- Why don't you just sing a
different song when you lose?

42:36.387 --> 42:37.387

42:38.139 --> 42:41.052
- As far as protests go, it
wasn't so bad.

42:41.059 --> 42:43.096
- That was not a protest.

42:43.102 --> 42:44.968
Unless you got someone
chained to infrastructure

42:44.979 --> 42:46.311
or a tree, a couple of arrests

42:46.314 --> 42:48.556
and someone wielding a banjo,
you're kidding yourself.

42:48.566 --> 42:50.808
- Do you think Bull will change
his mind?

42:50.818 --> 42:51.899
- The only way to change
their minds

42:51.903 --> 42:52.893
is to prove 'em wrong.

42:52.904 --> 42:55.738
- How was losing by 131
points proving them wrong?

42:55.740 --> 42:57.231
- They showed some good signs.

42:57.325 --> 42:59.191
- No, apart from Sayyid
they were shithouse.

42:59.202 --> 43:01.569
- Have you thought about
being a motivational speaker?

43:01.579 --> 43:02.911
- I talked myself out of it.

43:02.914 --> 43:05.406
Now Troy, I applaud
your imagination, mate,

43:05.416 --> 43:07.999
but if we can win a game
with this rabble,

43:08.002 --> 43:10.085
I'll get an ISIS tatt
on my calf.

43:10.088 --> 43:10.919
- He'll do it, too.

43:10.922 --> 43:13.005
He got a tramp stamp
after wrongly guessing

43:13.007 --> 43:14.088
the color of a clinker.

43:15.218 --> 43:17.210
- What's all this, Snaps?

43:17.220 --> 43:20.258
- Um, I'm trying to make an
organic nail polish remover

43:20.264 --> 43:22.722
using lemon juice as the base.

43:22.725 --> 43:23.590
- Any luck?

43:23.601 --> 43:24.601
- Umm, not yet.

43:26.604 --> 43:28.266
- So what's your process?

43:28.272 --> 43:30.855
- First I find out all the
things

43:30.858 --> 43:33.145
that lemon juice can do,

43:33.152 --> 43:36.145
like making lettuce
crisp, hair highlights,

43:36.155 --> 43:37.771
removing warts apparently.

43:37.782 --> 43:39.774
- Improve the taste of
Mexican beer.

43:39.784 --> 43:40.865
- Yep, and then I combine it

43:40.868 --> 43:42.279
with all the other elements
and see

43:42.286 --> 43:44.369
if it can do stuff you
wouldn't expect.

43:47.792 --> 43:50.125
- Take 'em home and read
'em, fellas.

43:50.128 --> 43:51.039
The more you know about
each other,

43:51.045 --> 43:52.206
the less you don't know.

43:52.213 --> 43:54.045
Now we're going to have
the first of our shed talks

43:54.048 --> 43:56.165
on Wednesday night with Harpo

43:56.175 --> 43:58.417
taking us through the
highlights of Tou's life.

43:58.427 --> 43:59.793
- So Dids, the bullet came
out there?

43:59.804 --> 44:01.215
How'd that feel?

44:01.222 --> 44:02.679
- I nearly die.

44:02.682 --> 44:03.798
- Yeah, shit question.

44:04.642 --> 44:06.053
I see you like basketball.

44:06.060 --> 44:08.222
- Hey Harpo, did you really
see the ghost of a pig?

44:08.229 --> 44:09.390
- Yeah, when I was eight.

44:09.397 --> 44:10.308
That's why I don't eat pork.

44:10.314 --> 44:12.647
- Hey, Burindi was '92
Olympics, yeah?

44:12.650 --> 44:14.312
- That was Barcelona, mate.

44:14.318 --> 44:15.934
- Sayyid, where is Alleppo?

44:15.945 --> 44:18.312
- What's left of it is
in the north of Syria.

44:18.322 --> 44:20.905
- Yeah, 'cause nothin's
comin' up on TripAdvisor.

44:20.908 --> 44:23.901
- Harpo, thou art also a
Shakespeare fan?

44:23.995 --> 44:25.202
- He yay verily goes all right.

44:25.204 --> 44:27.491
- Hey Troy, you didn't
even mention

44:27.498 --> 44:29.956
that I shagged the Miss New
Zealand contestant in Bali.

44:29.959 --> 44:30.949
- What the hell are you doing?

44:30.960 --> 44:33.168
- Just cornflour and
pomegranate, you dickhead.

44:33.171 --> 44:35.663
- You are the angriest
hippie I have ever met.

44:35.673 --> 44:37.164
What is the Archibald anyway?

44:37.175 --> 44:38.837
- It's Australia's
pre-eminent portrait prize

44:38.843 --> 44:39.833
and Harpo's gonna win it.

44:39.844 --> 44:41.631
- So suck it up and sit still.

44:41.721 --> 44:44.179
- Didier, what is Igishakamba?

44:44.182 --> 44:45.548
- It's a type of casserole
I think, isn't it?

44:45.558 --> 44:47.515
- No, no, no, it's a dance
in Burundi.

44:47.518 --> 44:48.518
I show you.

44:49.937 --> 44:50.937
- Okay.

44:53.149 --> 44:55.266
- Woo!
- Yeah, mate.

44:55.276 --> 44:58.815
- Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

45:02.867 --> 45:04.199
- My God!

45:06.412 --> 45:07.948
- This is the best bit.

45:09.498 --> 45:10.989
- Ooh, School Shoes.

45:12.877 --> 45:16.336
- What's this rubbish he's
got 'em doing?

45:18.966 --> 45:20.707
For a bloke who reckons he
loves trees,

45:20.718 --> 45:21.708
he doesn't mind knockin'
'em down

45:21.719 --> 45:23.585
to print any of this drivel,
does he?

45:24.472 --> 45:25.713
- Anyway, I've gotta scoot.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.180
So you be good, okay?

45:28.517 --> 45:29.517
See ya.

45:30.394 --> 45:31.601
Bye.
- Bye.

45:34.774 --> 45:36.436
Can you read that somewhere
else, please?

45:36.442 --> 45:37.603
- It's my kitchen.

45:37.610 --> 45:39.192
- Possession is 9/10 of the law.

45:39.195 --> 45:41.152
You haven't cooked even
a slice of toast in here

45:41.155 --> 45:44.193
for the last 25 years, so
shuffle along.

45:44.200 --> 45:46.442
Get over yourself and go
to bloody football training

45:46.452 --> 45:47.738
with her, will ya?

45:47.745 --> 45:50.032
The girls from book club
will be here in 10 minutes.

45:50.039 --> 45:51.871
- A man's not welcome
in his own footy club,

45:51.874 --> 45:52.990
in his own home.

45:53.084 --> 45:54.916
- Your violin needs tuning.

45:54.919 --> 45:56.535
- Look at you, would ya?

45:56.545 --> 45:58.332
Leadin' book club one night

45:58.339 --> 46:00.456
and Wog dancing the next.

46:01.884 --> 46:02.884
What's this?

46:03.761 --> 46:06.094
Vagina Monologues, what's that
even mean?

46:06.097 --> 46:08.054
- It's a play Angie and I are
going to.

46:08.933 --> 46:10.925
- Look at it will ya,
there's not a space on it.

46:10.935 --> 46:13.097
Are you preparing for when I'm
not around?

46:13.104 --> 46:14.766
- Don't do that.

46:14.772 --> 46:16.058
The Doc gave you the all clear.

46:16.065 --> 46:17.181
Get on with living.

46:17.191 --> 46:19.103
That's what I'm doing.

46:19.110 --> 46:20.897
- Brett's been gone just over
a year

46:20.903 --> 46:23.566
and you're living like
nothin' happened.

46:23.572 --> 46:25.939
And Angie's worse, carrying on
with Troy

46:25.950 --> 46:27.737
like her husband never existed.

46:27.827 --> 46:28.827
- Stop it!

46:30.246 --> 46:33.205
Why do you think that this
is so much harder for you

46:33.207 --> 46:34.448
than anybody else?

46:35.584 --> 46:37.246
I ache every time I
think of him.

46:46.971 --> 46:48.928
- Whoa, look at that action.

46:48.931 --> 46:49.842
Ooh!

46:49.849 --> 46:52.216
Beautiful!

46:52.226 --> 46:55.640
Canola bowler
champion wants more.

46:55.646 --> 46:56.646
Lovely.

46:59.233 --> 47:01.816
All right, who's up next?

47:01.819 --> 47:02.650
Who's up?

47:02.653 --> 47:03.939
Come on, Neil, your shot.

47:05.823 --> 47:09.237
- So in the end, Tou was in
detention for nearly 10 years.

47:10.161 --> 47:13.404
Just before the Ban
Vanai Refugee Camp closed

47:13.414 --> 47:16.122
Tou's family hid in the
northern plains of Thailand

47:17.084 --> 47:19.292
fearing they were gonna
be sent back to Laos.

47:21.380 --> 47:23.246
His father was caught
and imprisoned.

47:25.551 --> 47:27.838
His mother died
shortly afterwards,

47:30.306 --> 47:31.342
of malnutrition.

47:34.143 --> 47:35.475
- Take your time, mate.

47:37.104 --> 47:39.312
- His aunt and uncle that live
in the USA

47:41.359 --> 47:42.850
are his only living relatives.

47:45.654 --> 47:46.861
- It's okay, Harpo.

47:48.991 --> 47:49.991
Thank you.

47:55.373 --> 47:56.373
Good shed talk.

47:58.376 --> 47:59.376
We do thing now.

48:01.170 --> 48:04.584
- Also, Tou's really good at
doing the fainting goat thing.

48:17.603 --> 48:18.889
- Bodgy Creek Foodworks

48:18.896 --> 48:20.558
is the place to be this week.

48:20.564 --> 48:23.147
Paloumey an incredible $3.50.

48:23.150 --> 48:24.186
White rice...

48:24.193 --> 48:26.059
- Yeah, that's pretty cool.

48:26.070 --> 48:27.902
Bye, mate, I'll see
you tomorrow.

48:27.905 --> 48:29.316
Bodgy Creek Foodworks,

48:29.323 --> 48:31.406
where the whole world comes
to shop

48:31.409 --> 48:33.526
in the middle of nowhere.

48:33.536 --> 48:35.653
- Can you come to the Show
Us Your Dad/Guardian Day?

48:35.746 --> 48:36.746
- Yeah.

48:40.376 --> 48:42.413
- Krystal said you can't
bring granddads.

48:44.046 --> 48:47.210
But I asked Ms. Chadwick
and she said it's okay.

48:47.216 --> 48:48.627
- Yes, mate, I'll come.

48:52.555 --> 48:53.386
- Hey, look, there's Sayyid.

48:53.389 --> 48:54.596
We should give him a lift.

48:57.101 --> 48:59.184
- He lives next door to you now.

49:00.438 --> 49:02.771
- Why do you hate refugees
so much?

49:02.773 --> 49:03.604
- I don't hate 'em.

49:03.607 --> 49:05.690
They just don't belong here.

49:05.693 --> 49:06.934
- Who does belong here?

49:06.944 --> 49:08.355
- Well, I don't know.

49:09.238 --> 49:12.731
You, your Nana, your mum,
your dad.

49:14.702 --> 49:16.364
We're forgettin' who we are.

49:16.370 --> 49:18.953
Change is, change is no good.

49:20.583 --> 49:21.824
- I like change.

49:23.085 --> 49:25.748
Krystal just got moved to a
different work table today

49:26.630 --> 49:28.747
and I feel like a new man.

50:13.302 --> 50:14.588
- Hello!

50:14.595 --> 50:16.336
This is my family,
my wife, Fazela,

50:16.347 --> 50:18.304
and my daughter, Sima.

50:18.307 --> 50:20.014
- Hi!
- How are you?

50:21.810 --> 50:22.641
- Thank you very much.

50:22.645 --> 50:23.476
Please, go inside.

50:23.479 --> 50:24.720
I'll be in in a minute.

50:24.730 --> 50:25.730
Thank you.

50:48.337 --> 50:49.544
- So tonight

50:49.547 --> 50:51.664
is to Gary Humphreys who will
move to the senate in the...

50:51.674 --> 50:53.711
- Budgie pooh freezes in
three seconds.

50:53.717 --> 50:56.676
It's like having a pet
that craps ice magic.

50:56.679 --> 50:58.045
You've gotta get one.

51:01.684 --> 51:03.050
- You didn't get it?

51:03.060 --> 51:04.596
Nah?

51:04.603 --> 51:05.764
- How'd you go on site?

51:07.064 --> 51:08.851
- Well, the current
output is being diminished

51:08.857 --> 51:10.769
to a considerable degree by
the shortfall

51:10.776 --> 51:12.483
in requisite skills that
would favorably

51:12.486 --> 51:13.897
enhance a positive outcome.

51:13.904 --> 51:16.237
- So, shithouse?

51:16.240 --> 51:17.651
- With the exception of Sayyid

51:17.658 --> 51:19.615
this is not a talent pool
within which

51:19.618 --> 51:21.075
one would expect to drown.

51:21.078 --> 51:22.078
- Volume, Nev.

51:22.913 --> 51:25.121
- I've got over a thousand
signatures, Rebekah.

51:25.124 --> 51:27.366
This is a project our
community does not want.

51:27.376 --> 51:28.833
And the whole thing has
gone ahead

51:28.836 --> 51:30.623
without community approval.

51:30.629 --> 51:33.337
Have you seen the plans for
the community hub, Rebekah?

51:33.340 --> 51:35.582
They may as well be building
a mosque!

51:35.593 --> 51:37.084
- Bull Barlow there.

51:37.094 --> 51:40.132
So it looks like Carrington
is up to his old tricks.

51:40.139 --> 51:43.098
Notorious for his role in
closing the Bodgy Creek Mill,

51:43.100 --> 51:46.218
Carrington is once again using
his fame

51:46.312 --> 51:49.771
to divide the very community
that welcomed him back.

51:55.279 --> 51:56.144
- You all right?

51:56.155 --> 51:58.522
- Just realized I wasn't thirsty
anymore.

51:59.533 --> 52:00.533
- Yeah.

52:01.535 --> 52:03.242
You knew it wasn't gonna
be easy.

52:04.121 --> 52:06.534
- I'm trying to save
their footy club, Angie.

52:06.540 --> 52:07.371
Half this town look at me

52:07.374 --> 52:09.366
like I've shat in their
litter box.

52:09.376 --> 52:10.412
- Also not easy.

52:11.587 --> 52:12.998
- Gotta start winning games.

52:18.135 --> 52:19.135
- Good chat.

52:25.768 --> 52:28.636
- Why do you let me make this
shit, Carlos and Brigita?

52:28.646 --> 52:30.979
Tastes like a troll shat in
a rainbow.

53:14.316 --> 53:17.684
♪ I'd love to have a beer
with Tou Pou ♪

53:17.695 --> 53:20.938
♪ I'd love to have a beer

53:23.867 --> 53:24.698
- Right.

53:24.702 --> 53:25.863
Your opponent gets away
from you.

53:25.869 --> 53:28.612
- What midfielder
from yonder stoppage breaks.

53:28.622 --> 53:29.612
- Good stuff.

53:29.623 --> 53:31.615
Harpo, you've cracked the
shits with the umpire.

53:31.625 --> 53:32.536
What do you say?

53:32.543 --> 53:35.661
- Goodly umpire, thine eyes
deceive thee.

53:35.671 --> 53:38.084
- Thy judgment is clouded by
thy kinship to the maggot!

53:38.090 --> 53:38.955
- Excellent.

53:38.966 --> 53:42.334
- Stoop, Roosters stoop
and let us bathe our hands

53:42.428 --> 53:45.637
in our enemy's blood up to
the elbows!

53:47.224 --> 53:48.635
- Bit full on.

53:48.642 --> 53:51.635
And by this tongue, thou
shalt deceive thy foe.

53:51.645 --> 53:55.013
So hasten forth and
return not to this flimsy,

53:55.023 --> 53:57.731
canvas pavilion til thou
has bested thy enemy!

54:02.531 --> 54:04.648
- The Roosters
have fought hard today

54:04.658 --> 54:06.650
and are on the verge of a
very unexpected victory.

54:06.660 --> 54:07.491
- You're all right, you're
all right.

54:07.494 --> 54:08.494
School Shoes is gone.

54:10.664 --> 54:11.529
- How long to go?

54:11.540 --> 54:12.656
- Two minutes.

54:13.709 --> 54:15.917
- Frog Feet, back on.

54:19.965 --> 54:23.424
- Goodly opponent, this night
hence I did bed thy bride.

54:23.427 --> 54:26.090
And she yay verily went
off like the clappers.

54:27.264 --> 54:28.675
- Sayyid, Sayyid, Sayyid!

54:28.682 --> 54:30.924
I'm open, I'm open!

54:32.519 --> 54:34.260
- The Roosters have won it.

54:34.271 --> 54:35.807
I can't believe it!

55:27.658 --> 55:30.321
beers, wines, and cordials are
on me.

55:31.995 --> 55:32.826
- Hey, hey, hey!

55:32.830 --> 55:34.571
I prepare this for when we win.

55:34.581 --> 55:36.743
Bodgy Creek song in Arabic.

55:42.631 --> 55:43.462
- Hey, hey!

55:43.465 --> 55:44.376
Oi, oi!

55:44.383 --> 55:46.500
If you don't like singin'
it in our language,

55:46.510 --> 55:47.626
then piss off.

55:48.762 --> 55:50.094
- What is this man's problem?

55:50.097 --> 55:52.760
- Well, you not passin'
the ball for a start.

55:52.766 --> 55:55.509
- You are black pot
calling black kettle black.

55:55.519 --> 55:58.512
Not handball, not chase,
not dirty.

56:00.816 --> 56:01.852
- Yeah, let's go, Sultana.

56:01.859 --> 56:03.771
- Oi, oi!
- Ease up!

56:03.777 --> 56:05.689
Ease up, ease up, ease up.

56:05.696 --> 56:07.904
All right, settle down.

56:07.906 --> 56:10.364
Everyone grab your gear,
head down to the ball's club,

56:10.367 --> 56:11.653
and hit the showers.

56:11.660 --> 56:12.525
You're goin' with me, come here.

56:12.536 --> 56:13.993
- This man not need shower.

56:21.545 --> 56:22.786
- Fire!

56:22.796 --> 56:24.082
Fire!

56:24.089 --> 56:25.089
I said fire!

56:34.141 --> 56:37.134
- No, no, no, no!
- Don't do it, Snapper, no!

56:38.979 --> 56:41.062
- I got Graham!

57:02.711 --> 57:04.168
- Congrats to the Roosters.

57:04.171 --> 57:06.879
Their first win in three years,

57:06.882 --> 57:08.839
though the resulting
fire somewhat dampened

57:08.842 --> 57:09.707
the celebrations.

57:09.718 --> 57:11.254
I understand it's the first
time one club

57:11.261 --> 57:13.594
has lost two club rooms in
a season

57:13.597 --> 57:16.840
since the Mt. Stuart
sinkhole saga back in '67.

57:17.976 --> 57:20.434
I thought they were
tiny capsicums.

57:20.437 --> 57:23.726
- I give you an eye bath and
you will be fine, Porterhouse.

57:23.815 --> 57:26.603
- It's smaller than I hoped.

57:28.070 --> 57:29.311
What does it say, Sayyid?

57:30.322 --> 57:31.984
- I like cordial.

57:33.742 --> 57:35.324
- Are you serious?

57:35.327 --> 57:36.863
- Well, if you'd apologized
like I asked you to

57:36.870 --> 57:38.953
I wouldn't have to suspend you.

57:38.956 --> 57:40.618
- I'm done, I'm done.

57:40.624 --> 57:41.865
And you know what, Troy?

57:41.875 --> 57:43.958
You can shove your refos up
your ass.

57:50.092 --> 57:51.958
- Refos up your ass?

57:51.969 --> 57:54.962
That's the worst detention
center ever.

57:55.889 --> 57:57.300
What are you up to tomorrow?

57:57.307 --> 57:58.798
- Not a lot.

57:58.809 --> 58:01.142
- Well, I reckon it's about time

58:01.144 --> 58:03.887
that you were introduced
to some canola bowling.

58:18.078 --> 58:19.944
Here we go.

58:21.999 --> 58:23.080
- They're a bit small.

58:23.083 --> 58:24.494
- They're bowling shoes.

58:24.501 --> 58:26.367
They're not supposed to
be comfortable.

58:26.378 --> 58:28.495
- I'm losing circulation in
my toes.

58:28.505 --> 58:29.962
- Did you hear that, mate?

58:29.965 --> 58:31.797
I reckon you got him rattled.

58:31.800 --> 58:33.336
He's started making
excuses already.

58:33.343 --> 58:35.175
- He's got a right to be afraid.

58:36.680 --> 58:39.673
Canola bowler champion,
three years running.

58:40.642 --> 58:42.759
Count 'em and weep, Carrington.

58:42.769 --> 58:43.805
- Ooh.

58:43.812 --> 58:45.929
- Yeah, I'm just hearin'
this, Barlow.

58:45.939 --> 58:47.931
How about you walk the walk?

58:47.941 --> 58:49.461
- Go and show him how it's
done, champ.

58:55.866 --> 58:56.697
Ooh!

58:56.700 --> 58:57.941
Yes!

58:57.951 --> 58:58.951
Boom!

59:02.164 --> 59:04.030
- Yeah, you got lucky, Barlow.

59:04.041 --> 59:06.954
If it hadn't that rock, it'd
would've been a gutter ball.

59:06.960 --> 59:08.701
- Yeah, enough
trash talking, Tiny Shoes.

59:08.712 --> 59:10.795
How about you have a bowl?

59:14.968 --> 59:15.958
- All right.

59:15.969 --> 59:18.302
- Come on, Carrots,
let's see what you got.

59:21.683 --> 59:22.719
- Sou'easter.

59:30.067 --> 59:31.899
Ooh ho ho ho ho ho ho!

59:32.861 --> 59:33.861
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey?

59:35.864 --> 59:36.980
- Whatever.
- Look at that.

59:36.990 --> 59:37.990
- I'll get it.

59:43.747 --> 59:46.740
- He, he hasn't wanted to
play this since the accident.

59:54.758 --> 59:57.000
He bloody loves you.

59:57.010 --> 01:00:00.299
- Nah, he's just got a thing
for hermits.

01:00:00.305 --> 01:00:01.887
- Yeah, I don't mind 'em myself.

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:05.466
- Well, any response to that

01:00:05.477 --> 01:00:07.389
might impact on my status as
a hermit.

01:00:08.897 --> 01:00:10.388
- Found it!

01:00:17.906 --> 01:00:19.898
- Time to switch to the footy.

01:00:19.908 --> 01:00:20.739
- Hang on a second.

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:21.858
- Now, mate.

01:00:21.868 --> 01:00:23.609
You've watched that clip too
much anyway.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.077
- I filmed this yesterday.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.032
- Yeah!

01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:40.463
- Where is she?

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.211
- Who?
- Don't you bullshit me.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.882
- If by she you mean
Angie, she's not here.

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:47.178
- You keep away from her.

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:49.973
I seen you playing canola
bowl, you thievin' bastard.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.768
That's my son's wife and my
son's kid.

01:00:52.774 --> 01:00:54.766
No, it's just not right.

01:00:54.776 --> 01:00:57.268
You replacin' him like
he, like he never existed.

01:00:57.279 --> 01:00:58.941
- I'm not tryin' to
replace anyone.

01:00:58.947 --> 01:01:01.860
- You're a pot stirrer,
Carrington, you always have been.

01:01:01.867 --> 01:01:02.823
- I can't imagine what
if would have been like

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:03.942
to lose Brett, but...

01:01:04.035 --> 01:01:05.321
- No, you bloody can't!

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:06.819
So I'll say it once again.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:07.946
You keep away from her.

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:11.540
And you know what?

01:01:11.543 --> 01:01:12.659
Your old man would tell you

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.126
to do exactly the same thing.

01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:17.088
What the hell are
you doing to this place?

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:18.797
- I'm making a living out of it.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.382
I reckon he would have
been all right with that.

01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:21.385
- Ooh, yeah.

01:01:22.804 --> 01:01:23.669
- And he would've been happy

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:24.670
that I was trying to save the
footy club

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:26.092
that you ran into the ground.

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:30.227
- You!

01:01:33.315 --> 01:01:34.315
- Bull!
- Ooh!

01:01:35.275 --> 01:01:36.231
- Bull?

01:01:36.234 --> 01:01:37.315
Bull!

01:01:46.369 --> 01:01:47.450
- He's gonna be fine.

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:50.408
- What was it?

01:01:50.415 --> 01:01:53.408
- A combination of meds,
low blood pressure, stress.

01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:56.870
He just needs to look after
himself.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:57.880
- Righto.

01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:01.424
- He said, he said to say thanks

01:02:01.426 --> 01:02:04.419
for taking care of him,
despite what was said.

01:02:05.513 --> 01:02:07.004
- Yeah, no drama.

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:11.055
- So, what was said?

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.973
- We had some conflicting
points of view.

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:13.890
- On?

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:16.890
- On, well, my old man,
biodynamic farming, and...

01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:22.520
- And?

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:25.773
- He was fairly clear that
us spending any time together

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:27.241
wasn't his preferred outcome.

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:36.784
And what's your
preferred outcome?

01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:37.795
- Not his.

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:41.757
Good.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:48.255
Well, I better get back to
the old bastard.

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:57.764
- Right, well,
let's all thank Mr. Carter.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.234
- Thank you, Mr.
Carter.

01:03:01.236 --> 01:03:03.193
- Does anyone think they
might want

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:05.028
to work in an abattoir?

01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:08.358
So, let's have Mr...

01:03:08.368 --> 01:03:10.576
- I'll, I'll go next.

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:12.194
So it's all right.

01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:13.571
I've got undies on.

01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:16.369
I just, see, a friend hid
my clothes

01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:18.584
otherwise I would have changed.

01:03:18.586 --> 01:03:20.953
Right, so, um,

01:03:20.964 --> 01:03:24.457
I'm Bull, and yous can call
me Bull.

01:03:24.467 --> 01:03:26.333
- Is that your real name?

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:27.755
- No, no.

01:03:27.846 --> 01:03:28.846
- Then what is it?

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.256
- Gabriel.

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:34.224
Anyway, I'm lived here for a
long time

01:03:34.227 --> 01:03:36.685
so, any questions?

01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:39.226
- You're not Neil's dad.

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:42.225
- No, I'm his granddad.
- Where's his dad?

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:45.228
- Krystal, let's give some
of the other kids a turn.

01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:47.525
- No, no, no, it's all right.

01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:51.074
Well, Neil's dad, he,

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:55.322
he couldn't be here because
he's had an accident

01:03:58.251 --> 01:04:01.244
a year ago, on his motorbike.

01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:02.838
And, um,

01:04:04.966 --> 01:04:07.083
so I'm here instead.

01:04:10.263 --> 01:04:11.263
For Neil.

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:17.010
Um, Ms. Chadwick, it's a
bit harder than I thought.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:20.689
- Mr. Bull.

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:26.569
Losing son and father is very
bad thing.

01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:31.153
My father was murdered in
front of me and brother,

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:34.201
which makes me very sad.

01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:37.329
A long time I cannot think.

01:04:37.332 --> 01:04:40.325
I'm always angry, even
at the small things.

01:04:43.171 --> 01:04:45.288
Then I knew I must find
safe home

01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:48.757
for wife, Fazela, and daughter,
Sima, away from civil war.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.883
A long time I must wait in hot
shit place.

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:56.595
Sorry, Ms. Chadwick, I should
not say shit in school.

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:03.146
I'm sorry you lose your
son, Gabriel.

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:04.685
- İt's Bull.

01:05:05.693 --> 01:05:07.685
- I cannot call you Gabriel?

01:05:07.695 --> 01:05:09.311
This is beautiful name.

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:10.608
Your mother give you this name.

01:05:10.615 --> 01:05:13.904
Why you want to be
called man cow?

01:05:21.209 --> 01:05:24.043
- Famous root, Enya.
- Enya?

01:05:24.045 --> 01:05:25.911
- Yeah, while her
music's playing.

01:05:26.714 --> 01:05:29.081
- Don't diss the
Celtic priestess.

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:30.924
And yours?

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:32.213
- No, I'm not gonna say
what mine...

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:33.051
- Come on.
- No!

01:05:33.054 --> 01:05:34.090
- I told you mine.
- It's embarrassing.

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:35.463
- That's all right.
- It's Captain Von Trapp.

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:37.760
- Ooh, that's weird.

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.679
You'd end up with six
extra kids.

01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:40.517
- No, you're over thinking this.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.352
This is famous root, not
famous marry.

01:05:42.355 --> 01:05:45.223
- I don't believe in
coitus out of wedlock, so...

01:05:46.484 --> 01:05:47.484
- That's a shame.

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:54.948
What?

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:56.613
What is it?
- Nothing.

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:57.450
- No, what is it?

01:05:57.454 --> 01:05:58.695
There's something wrong.

01:05:58.705 --> 01:05:59.661
Is it, is it Bull?

01:05:59.664 --> 01:06:00.700
- And the rest.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:02.823
I don't wanna give this town

01:06:02.834 --> 01:06:04.200
anymore reasons to hate me.

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:08.379
- I just, I just held
your hand, you dickhead.

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:09.622
Or does that mean
we're betrothed

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:11.965
in your archaic views
on courting?

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:13.379
- Indeed it does.

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:21.142
- Living in a small
town surrounded

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:22.555
by your dead husband's mates

01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:24.554
is a particular brand of lonely.

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:29.145
When they're sober, they
don't know what to say

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:31.269
and when they're drunk, well,

01:06:31.279 --> 01:06:33.692
they wanna do more than hold
your hand.

01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:36.691
- That must make you
miss him all the more.

01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:38.452
- Yeah, it does.

01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:40.329
So much.

01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:45.407
But that doesn't mean I
just give up.

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:47.410
Anyone who still hates
you is a bloody idiot.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.412
I mean, look what you have done.

01:06:49.422 --> 01:06:50.422
It's amazing.

01:06:52.425 --> 01:06:53.425
You're amazing.

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:57.715
If I had walked in here tonight

01:06:57.722 --> 01:07:00.305
and found that you were
curing a bunch of lepers,

01:07:00.308 --> 01:07:03.051
I would have just shrugged
and gone, yeah, I figured.

01:07:03.061 --> 01:07:05.303
- I would never expose
you to that kind of risk.

01:07:05.313 --> 01:07:07.851
Got the whole colony locked in
the shed.

01:07:11.319 --> 01:07:12.435
- No.

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:13.276
- What?

01:07:13.279 --> 01:07:14.279
- My God.

01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:20.283
You've got a black spot.

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:22.198
It's the first symptom.

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:23.787
- Ooh, that's disappointing.

01:07:23.790 --> 01:07:25.156
- Yeah.

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:26.166
I could,

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:28.079
I could kiss it off.

01:07:30.463 --> 01:07:33.046
- That's an unorthodox
course of treatment.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:34.836
Could be worth a try.

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:39.386
- Hey guys.

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:41.176
- Hey, Snaps.

01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:43.515
This is, um, standard leprosy
treatment.

01:07:43.518 --> 01:07:44.349
- Fair enough.

01:07:44.352 --> 01:07:45.217
Sorry, Troy, I just
needed to show you this.

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:46.594
I crushed up some
quandong berries

01:07:46.604 --> 01:07:48.766
and mixed it with your wine,
and look,

01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:50.480
organic nail polish remover!

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:52.475
One coat and it was gone.

01:07:52.485 --> 01:07:54.898
- Does it also make blokes
that lob up uninvited

01:07:54.988 --> 01:07:55.988
disappear?

01:07:56.864 --> 01:07:59.072
- Sorry, I just need to grab
some flagons

01:07:59.075 --> 01:08:01.362
straight out of your fermentor.

01:08:01.369 --> 01:08:02.369

01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:13.667
- Sorry, Troy.

01:10:16.921 --> 01:10:19.834
- Harpo, Carpet
Burn, Sayyid, interchange.

01:10:19.841 --> 01:10:23.209
Anpu, Suresh, School
Shoes, and Iraqi Kevin,

01:10:23.219 --> 01:10:24.926
emergency snapper.

01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:26.386
Good luck.

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:29.223
- Yeah, and you guys,
whoever's takin' the bus

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:31.512
we're leavin' the pub at 11
o'clock sharp.

01:10:31.519 --> 01:10:32.350
So don't be late.

01:10:32.353 --> 01:10:33.560
- What are you doing?
- What?

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:35.225
- Why isn't Snapper playing?

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:36.938
- It's the semi-final.

01:10:37.024 --> 01:10:39.232
We have to beat the best
team, he knows that.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:40.692
- Does he?

01:10:40.695 --> 01:10:42.482
I think you might have
to explain it to him.

01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:44.946
Picking Carpet Burn ahead
of Snapper

01:10:44.949 --> 01:10:47.236
goes against everything
you've been trying to do here.

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:47.983
- Come on, Angie.

01:10:47.994 --> 01:10:49.656
We're that close now.

01:10:49.662 --> 01:10:50.662
- Close to what?

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:53.913
Look.

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:56.124
Look at all this, this team.

01:10:57.545 --> 01:10:58.661
That's your victory.

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:07.262
Snapper.

01:11:21.819 --> 01:11:23.731
- Boys, boys!

01:11:23.738 --> 01:11:26.981
You can start paintin' the
premiership plank, boys.

01:11:26.991 --> 01:11:28.698
The beers are on me!

01:11:31.412 --> 01:11:32.698
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.742
Don't go too hard,

01:11:34.749 --> 01:11:36.991
'cause you got a premiership
to win next week!

01:11:38.795 --> 01:11:39.626
- Hey, hey!

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:42.417
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey!

01:11:42.507 --> 01:11:44.715
Who is the best player today,
Sayyid?

01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:46.629
This is a very hard question.

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:48.298
It was me, of course!

01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:50.762
- Oi, oi!

01:11:50.765 --> 01:11:51.846
Nope, I kicked four goals.

01:11:51.849 --> 01:11:54.466
I think we all know Carpets was
B-O-G!

01:11:54.477 --> 01:11:55.308
Hey!

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:56.142
Come on.

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:57.261
We're in the Grannie, boys.

01:11:57.355 --> 01:11:58.937
We're in the Grannie, let's
drink to it!

01:12:01.025 --> 01:12:02.061
Come on, mate, have a beer.

01:12:02.068 --> 01:12:02.899
Come on, we won.
- No, thank you.

01:12:02.902 --> 01:12:03.733
- Come on, have a beer.

01:12:03.736 --> 01:12:06.069
- No, thank you.
- Scull, scull, scull, scull...

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:08.490
- No!
- Scull, scull.

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:10.325
- Knock it off, Carpets.

01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:14.740
- Come on
down to the Bodgy Creek

01:12:14.747 --> 01:12:17.740
Bowling Club Open Day this
Sunday.

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:19.491
There'll be barefoot bowls
for prospective members

01:12:19.502 --> 01:12:21.835
and we'll be raffling
the biggest meat tray

01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:23.329
in the southern hemisphere.

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:25.956
And entertainment will
be provided by new local,

01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:28.084
Tou Pou, who will play the
traditional Hmong flute...

01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:29.335
- Oi, Sayyid!

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:32.133
Save some energy for the
Final, mate.

01:12:32.139 --> 01:12:33.471
- Can you please?

01:12:33.558 --> 01:12:35.390
I must go Ms. Angie office.

01:12:35.393 --> 01:12:37.180
I must get Visa for
brother, Ammad, and mother.

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:39.473
Not safe.
- Get in, get in.

01:12:53.494 --> 01:12:54.780
- Hello, you have called Sayyid.

01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:57.530
Please leave a message and
I will try to call you back.

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:08.256
- Fran, is Sayyid in?

01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:10.963
- Yeah, he is, love, but -

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:13.087
- He didn't come to
training, of all weeks.

01:13:14.557 --> 01:13:15.889
- You haven't heard, love.

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:16.892
- Heard what?

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:20.806
- Sayyid's brother, Ammad.

01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:23.555
There was a raid in Alleppo.

01:13:25.401 --> 01:13:26.517
He was shot and killed.

01:13:26.527 --> 01:13:28.018
- No.

01:13:28.029 --> 01:13:29.029
No.

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:31.740
His mum?

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:33.742
- She wasn't hurt.

01:13:34.952 --> 01:13:36.409
Angie's been on the
blower all night

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:37.823
trying to fast-track a visa.

01:13:39.206 --> 01:13:40.742
- Should I go in?

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:42.582
- They've only just gone to
sleep, love.

01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:47.172
- Thanks.

- Does your mum know you're
here?

01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:18.052
- She's at the theater.

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:19.671
What's a monologue?

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:20.672
- It's when an actor in a play

01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:22.265
does a speech on their own.

01:15:23.519 --> 01:15:25.977
- Then I think I need
you to re-explain to me

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:27.937
what a vagina is.

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:29.181
What are you making?

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:32.559
- I'll show you
later, when it's finished.

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:39.032
You can film me if you want.

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:40.367
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:56.667
- Interview 28 with Troy
Carrington.

01:15:56.677 --> 01:15:59.715
Why did you pick Carpet
Burn instead of Snapper?

01:15:59.722 --> 01:16:01.054
- He's a good player.

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:02.844
- He's also a dickhead.

01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:05.968
- He apologized for the way
he acted.

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:07.685
- Krystal said she was sorry,

01:16:07.688 --> 01:16:10.852
and flushed my sun hat in
the toilet the next day.

01:16:10.858 --> 01:16:11.858
She's a dickhead.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:14.226
- I see your point.

01:16:17.865 --> 01:16:20.699
- Do you reckon it would
have hurt?

01:16:20.701 --> 01:16:22.283
- What, mate?

01:16:22.286 --> 01:16:23.868
- Sayyid's brother gettin' shot.

01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:28.415
Yeah, probably.

01:16:29.418 --> 01:16:30.249
At first.

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:32.619
But sometimes it can happen
so fast that

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:35.998
you might only feel it for
a second.

01:16:37.051 --> 01:16:39.043
- And then they die?

01:16:39.053 --> 01:16:40.134
- Yeah, mate.

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:47.434
- They reckon my dad
died instantly.

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:50.224
So he wouldn't have felt
anything, right?

01:16:50.231 --> 01:16:51.231
- I'd say.

01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:55.768
- Did your mum die instantly?

01:16:56.737 --> 01:16:59.275
- She went the
best way, in her sleep.

01:17:00.407 --> 01:17:03.195
I took in her a peppermint
tea and she wouldn't wake up.

01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:07.028
- Do you miss her?

01:17:07.039 --> 01:17:08.496
- You never stop missing them.

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:14.878
- I don't want my mum to
die instantly,

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:17.623
or even in slow motion.

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:18.669
- Neither do I.

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.968
- I don't want
you to die second most.

01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:23.930
- Thanks.

01:17:26.058 --> 01:17:28.926
- Used to be Nana and
Grandaddy equal second.

01:17:28.936 --> 01:17:29.936
Now they're equal third.

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:33.934
Who's your top three?

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:39.065
I don't mind being second
if mum's number one.

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:42.113
- That sounds fair.

01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:13.428
- He was keeping me alive.

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:16.313
Everyday I miss wife, I
miss daughter.

01:18:16.317 --> 01:18:18.684
I am sad, I am angry.

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:20.686
Everyday Ammad would tell me,

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:23.734
Sayyid be strong, one day we be
free, yes?

01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:27.442
Then when government man come
and say

01:18:27.453 --> 01:18:29.820
Sayyid, Ammad, you are not
real refugees.

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:31.116
Not real?

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:32.864
How can he say this?

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:34.036
So I tell this stupid man,

01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:36.285
Assad government troops kill
my father

01:18:36.295 --> 01:18:38.708
because they say we are rebels!

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:41.331
If we go home, terrorists will
kill us.

01:18:41.342 --> 01:18:44.335
Chemical weapons will kill
us, bombs will kill us!

01:18:45.512 --> 01:18:48.129
But Ammad, he is quiet.

01:18:51.518 --> 01:18:54.511
Then he say, Sayyid, I
have enough, I go home.

01:18:58.317 --> 01:19:00.354
I was so angry, I say nothing.

01:19:01.904 --> 01:19:03.236
But they take him at night.

01:19:05.032 --> 01:19:08.446
I did not get to say goodbye
to my brother.

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:14.740
I make snot bubble like baby.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:15.750
- Get him a tissue.

01:19:21.507 --> 01:19:23.339
- 100% linen?

01:19:23.342 --> 01:19:24.378
Sayyid not animal.

01:19:24.385 --> 01:19:26.627
Gabriel get Sayyid a tissue!

01:19:28.389 --> 01:19:29.389
- Thank you.

01:19:36.605 --> 01:19:37.937
I still play Grand Final.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:38.940
- No, mate.

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:40.900
It's just a game.

01:19:41.777 --> 01:19:44.315
- But you will lose if Sayyid
not play.

01:19:44.321 --> 01:19:45.778
- Probably.

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:52.072
- I miss my brother.

01:19:52.079 --> 01:19:53.079
- I know you do.

01:19:56.375 --> 01:19:58.082
I know you do, mate.

01:20:07.386 --> 01:20:09.048
- Hello.

01:20:09.054 --> 01:20:10.795
It's the dickhead who canceled
training

01:20:10.806 --> 01:20:13.048
on Grand Final week.

01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:14.549
- It's the right thing to do.

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.677
- Yeah, whatever you say,
coach of the year.

01:20:16.687 --> 01:20:18.223
- You're not playing.

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:19.095
- What?

01:20:19.106 --> 01:20:20.096
Yeah right.

01:20:20.107 --> 01:20:21.473
- Thought I'd let you know
before we put the teams

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:23.190
in the bakery window.

01:20:23.277 --> 01:20:24.813
- Well, you are joking.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:25.651
- I'm not.

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:26.940
- Explain to me why you would
drop

01:20:26.947 --> 01:20:30.065
the Best and Fairest winner
of the last two years.

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:32.237
- Sometimes the fairest
bit gets overlooked.

01:20:34.955 --> 01:20:35.955
- Troy.

01:20:40.377 --> 01:20:41.377
Fuck!

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:44.704
- Mate, I need to apologize.

01:20:44.715 --> 01:20:45.671
- What for?

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:47.290
- You should have played last
weekend.

01:20:47.301 --> 01:20:48.508
- Nah, that's, that's all right.

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.001
- No, it's not.

01:20:50.012 --> 01:20:51.093
You're the one who's backed this

01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:53.258
since I turned up to the
first training session

01:20:53.265 --> 01:20:55.257
with mime footballs.

01:20:55.267 --> 01:20:56.508
- I'm pretty good at mime footy.

01:20:56.518 --> 01:20:58.225
- There's none better.

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:03.269
- I was gonna tell you about
this before, with Sayyid.

01:21:03.275 --> 01:21:04.891
I didn't wanna...
- Tell me what?

01:21:04.902 --> 01:21:05.733
- My God.

01:21:05.736 --> 01:21:06.852
Come in, dome in, come in.

01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:08.863
Guys.

01:21:11.617 --> 01:21:12.698
Look, I knew it worked.

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.033
I just, I couldn't work out why

01:21:14.036 --> 01:21:16.278
and then I told Didier about the
alpacas

01:21:16.288 --> 01:21:19.622
spitting in the wine
vats, and then, boing!

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:21.491
And it's not even just
nail polish remover.

01:21:21.502 --> 01:21:23.038
- Yes, I tweak the formula

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:24.877
and also made a wallpaper
remover.

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.997
- It works as radiator coolant
too.

01:21:27.007 --> 01:21:29.294
- Insect repellent not work.

01:21:29.301 --> 01:21:32.544
- We're gonna call it Cleano
Noir.

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:34.716
Yes, no, yes?

01:21:36.141 --> 01:21:37.177
- I like it.

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:38.595
- I set up the online shop.

01:21:38.602 --> 01:21:40.218
The pre-orders are overwhelming.

01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:42.562
- Every cent goes to Sayyid.

01:21:42.564 --> 01:21:45.432
And Tou's malaria shots.

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:52.696
- It's the
Rooster's first Grand Final

01:21:52.699 --> 01:21:55.692
since 1994 and the crowds are
pouring into the Cougar cage.

01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:58.157
It's going off like a forgotten
hot dog

01:21:58.163 --> 01:21:59.779
in a thermos here today.

01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:01.656
And if the Roosters can
pull off this upset,

01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:02.703
well, I'm not a drinking man,

01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:04.200
but I'll be asking Neville

01:22:04.211 --> 01:22:06.043
for a lemon lime and double
bitters.

01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:22.640
- When the guards ask me
to play football on Nauru,

01:22:23.981 --> 01:22:26.268
I tell them that Ammad should
play,

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:29.484
and they say no, he is
small like horse jockey.

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:36.108
I don't want to leave
him but he say to me,

01:22:36.118 --> 01:22:39.282
"No, Sayyid, play the game for
me."

01:22:41.707 --> 01:22:44.950
Today, I play the game
for my brother Ammad.

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:47.251
- Armad!

01:22:47.254 --> 01:22:48.370
- Not Armad!

01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:49.712
You speak shit Arabic.

01:22:54.428 --> 01:22:55.384
- Give the man some space.

01:22:55.387 --> 01:22:57.219
Go and get changed.

01:22:57.222 --> 01:22:58.258
Grab a possie.

01:23:01.101 --> 01:23:02.101
Snapper.

01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:04.389
Where's Didier from?

01:23:04.396 --> 01:23:05.432
- Bujumbura, Burindi.

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:10.600
- Harpo, what's Tou's phobia?

01:23:10.611 --> 01:23:11.611
- Balloons popping.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:18.608
- Didier, what nickname does
Suresh give his genitals?

01:23:18.619 --> 01:23:19.735
- The gentlemen below.

01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:22.283
- True.

01:23:22.289 --> 01:23:24.281
- For a while, I forgot how much

01:23:24.291 --> 01:23:25.452
you blokes look out for each
other,

01:23:25.459 --> 01:23:28.167
and I don't mean out there on
the field.

01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:29.170
Goober.

01:23:30.172 --> 01:23:32.664
This bloke, he drove Tou to
Canberra

01:23:32.674 --> 01:23:35.007
to help sort out his visa
issues.

01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:40.672
Snapper paid for Did's
chemistry accreditation.

01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:44.350
And last night under the pump,

01:23:44.353 --> 01:23:46.686
this bloke, Porterhouse,
organized meals

01:23:46.688 --> 01:23:48.179
for Sayyid's family.

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:49.476
- Well done!

01:23:51.318 --> 01:23:52.809
- But you don't go on about it.

01:23:54.071 --> 01:23:56.779
Who knows himself a
braggart, let him fear this,

01:23:56.782 --> 01:23:58.899
for it shall come to
pass that every braggart

01:23:58.909 --> 01:24:00.821
shall be found an ass.

01:24:00.827 --> 01:24:02.284
- All's Well That Ends Well, Act
Four.

01:24:02.287 --> 01:24:04.028
- Bang on the money, Harps.

01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:07.786
I lost sight of that,

01:24:09.044 --> 01:24:10.044
and I'm so sorry.

01:24:12.589 --> 01:24:14.831
But today we take it to the next
level.

01:24:14.841 --> 01:24:18.084
Today we get to know the
Hudson's Flat blokes inside out.

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:22.221
Now I want you to spend the
first quarter

01:24:22.224 --> 01:24:25.217
getting to know everything
you can about your opponent.

01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:26.343
They may wear a different jumper

01:24:26.353 --> 01:24:28.720
but doesn't mean we have to hate
'em.

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:30.517
- I know you don't wanna
hear this, but,

01:24:30.524 --> 01:24:33.733
it is the Cougars and I
genuinely do hate them.

01:24:35.070 --> 01:24:36.231
- Fair point.

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:38.946
Goober, you've spent all
year getting to know people

01:24:38.949 --> 01:24:39.735
from all around the world.

01:24:39.825 --> 01:24:42.238
These blokes live 23 kilometers
away.

01:24:42.244 --> 01:24:43.405
They breathe the same air.

01:24:43.412 --> 01:24:44.869
They drink the same water.

01:24:44.871 --> 01:24:47.079
They've got the same
dickhead local member.

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:51.618
Microscopically speaking,
we're gonna improve the world

01:24:51.628 --> 01:24:53.085
for maybe 100 minutes.

01:24:54.715 --> 01:24:56.752
Bonus if we put 'em off their
game.

01:24:57.801 --> 01:24:58.917
- Righto.

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:00.964
Ruffy, okay, he's on the paleo
diet.

01:25:00.971 --> 01:25:02.507
Talks about nothing else
apparently.

01:25:02.514 --> 01:25:04.380
- You get Boof talking
about racing pigeons,

01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:05.632
you will not shut him up.

01:25:05.642 --> 01:25:07.099
- Yeah, he may look neanderthal

01:25:07.102 --> 01:25:08.968
but the man keeps an immaculate
aviary.

01:25:08.979 --> 01:25:12.268
- Actually, he's very
sensitive about being adopted,

01:25:12.274 --> 01:25:14.266
so tread lightly.

01:25:14.276 --> 01:25:15.608
- Yeah.
- Good to know.

01:25:15.694 --> 01:25:18.732
Hibbert, very keen to
give musical theater a go.

01:25:18.739 --> 01:25:20.776
- Yeah, light opera in
particular.

01:25:20.782 --> 01:25:21.772
Yeah, okay.

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:24.116
And Ponko, now either he has
worms

01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:27.237
or he has the hots for the
Hudson flat chemist nurse.

01:25:27.247 --> 01:25:29.239
He was in there three times
yesterday.

01:25:29.249 --> 01:25:31.457
- If it is worms, he
should take Praziquental.

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:32.460
- Or Albenzadole.

01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:36.128
- Bit of meat on a string takes
'em out.

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:38.123
- That's a bit full on.

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:40.420
All right, boys, up on your
feet.

01:25:43.305 --> 01:25:44.887
- Today we invert the paradigm.

01:25:44.890 --> 01:25:46.176
I want you to go out there,

01:25:46.183 --> 01:25:47.674
shake your hands with
your opponent,

01:25:47.684 --> 01:25:50.267
and metaphorically
speaking, never let it go!

01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:53.481
Come on!

01:25:58.278 --> 01:25:59.439
- Here you go, princess.

01:26:00.322 --> 01:26:02.029
- Hang on, we're one
short again.

01:26:02.032 --> 01:26:02.863
- Don't worry about that.

01:26:02.866 --> 01:26:04.653
Keep yourself pumped up.

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:06.993
Today we do it for Ammad and
School Shoes.

01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:21.757
- Come on, Roosters!

01:26:26.431 --> 01:26:27.888
- 'Scuse me, boys.

01:26:39.611 --> 01:26:42.729
Righto, boys, we got a Grannie
to win!

01:26:59.506 --> 01:27:00.917
- There's the bounce

01:27:00.924 --> 01:27:03.917
and we are under way in the
big one!

01:27:08.682 --> 01:27:10.093
- That's so cool, Weetbix.

01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:11.511
I thought you had to be,
like, a doctor or a nurse

01:27:11.518 --> 01:27:13.225
to join Medicines San Frontiers.

01:27:13.228 --> 01:27:14.514
- Nah, I'm just
delivering supplies.

01:27:14.521 --> 01:27:17.059
I just need a Level Three
First Aid Certificate.

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:18.397
- Got your injections yet?

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:21.393
- I hate needles.

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:26.276
- Well done, my protoge!

01:27:26.283 --> 01:27:27.694
- Sorry, Weetbix.

01:27:29.995 --> 01:27:31.531
- That's full on, Boof.

01:27:31.538 --> 01:27:33.655
What was it like when you
finally met him?

01:27:33.665 --> 01:27:34.997
- It was weird, Goob.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.536
Even though he was me
biological dad,

01:27:36.543 --> 01:27:39.035
there was just no connection
there.

01:27:39.045 --> 01:27:40.411
Showed a complete lack
of interest

01:27:40.422 --> 01:27:42.914
when I showed him me
pigeon coops.

01:27:42.924 --> 01:27:44.085
Haven't seen him since.

01:27:50.849 --> 01:27:52.431
- Sorry to hear, mate.

01:27:54.603 --> 01:27:57.687
- Porterhouse, go round, mate!

01:28:03.528 --> 01:28:04.985
- Well done!

01:28:04.988 --> 01:28:07.275
- Well done indeed Porterhouse.

01:28:07.282 --> 01:28:09.148
Well, that's the end of the
first quarter

01:28:09.159 --> 01:28:12.277
and good news, the Roosters
are up by 13 points.

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:14.779
- I've been on paleo
for the last six months.

01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:16.531
- Paleo's overrated, Ruffy.

01:28:16.541 --> 01:28:18.578
I haven't eaten meat for
the past seven years.

01:28:18.585 --> 01:28:19.951
Look at the size of me, pal.

01:28:29.805 --> 01:28:32.764
- If you like the chemist
nurse, Ponko, ask her out.

01:28:32.766 --> 01:28:34.974
- What if she has a boyfriend?

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:37.093
- Well, she won't be your
boyfriend

01:28:37.103 --> 01:28:39.470
if you always buy medicine you
don't need.

01:28:39.481 --> 01:28:41.313
She probably think you dying.

01:28:41.316 --> 01:28:43.603
Or worse, have penis disease.

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:49.154
- Poplarville's got a light
opera company.

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:51.865
They did an amazing production
of lolanthe last year.

01:28:51.868 --> 01:28:53.609
You know what, I'll get
the musical director

01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:54.952
to give you a call.

01:28:54.955 --> 01:28:56.742
- That'd be awesome, Troy.

01:28:56.748 --> 01:28:58.330
- All right, I'll let him know.

01:29:05.465 --> 01:29:07.331
- Lookin' good, boys!

01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:08.628
- Ooohh!

01:29:14.766 --> 01:29:16.098
- So, as I was saying,

01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:18.889
we were effectively
trapped between the rebels

01:29:18.895 --> 01:29:20.181
and the government forces

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:23.522
while the artillery was pounding
our home from both sides.

01:29:23.525 --> 01:29:25.767
It is a miracle that we
survived.

01:29:25.777 --> 01:29:28.360
But of course, thousands weren't
so lucky.

01:29:28.363 --> 01:29:29.979
Have a great halftime
break, guys!

01:29:33.076 --> 01:29:35.819
- Well butter
my crumpets on both sides,

01:29:35.829 --> 01:29:37.536
the Roosters are up by 21 points

01:29:37.539 --> 01:29:39.371
going into the third quarter,

01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:41.787
which has just got under way.

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:46.537
- Tell your ex that you
forgive her.

01:29:46.548 --> 01:29:49.040
It might give you closure.

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:51.508
- You're bloody right, Ruffy.

01:29:53.513 --> 01:29:56.551
- Get a hold of 'em, get 'em!

01:29:59.728 --> 01:30:01.390
- I'd never thought of it like
that.

01:30:01.396 --> 01:30:02.432
- Just have a beer with him.

01:30:02.439 --> 01:30:04.556
Not as father and son, but
as mates.

01:30:05.567 --> 01:30:08.105
- Yeah, thanks, Goober.
- No worries, mate.

01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:22.406
- Well that's 3/4 time

01:30:22.417 --> 01:30:24.955
and the Roosters might just be
in front,

01:30:24.961 --> 01:30:27.123
but the Cougars have all the
momentum.

01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:28.541
- Yeah, we're still
in this, we're still in this.

01:30:28.548 --> 01:30:30.585
- In nice and close,
in nice and close.

01:30:30.592 --> 01:30:32.925
All right, it
worked for us early on

01:30:32.928 --> 01:30:33.759
but they're onto us now,

01:30:33.762 --> 01:30:35.594
so we need to ease up
on the friendly chatter.

01:30:35.597 --> 01:30:37.554
- Troy, I am this
close to gettin' Boof

01:30:37.641 --> 01:30:40.258
to call his biological dad
and give it another crack.

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:41.600
- Weetbix is gonna
write me a reference

01:30:41.603 --> 01:30:43.845
to Medicine Sans Frontier,
which would be amazing.

01:30:46.691 --> 01:30:47.556
- Oi!

01:30:47.567 --> 01:30:48.478
Oi, oi, oi!

01:30:48.485 --> 01:30:50.101
Put a bloody sock in it!

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:52.444
Look at yourselves.

01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:55.440
Go on, have a bloody
good look at yourselves.

01:30:55.450 --> 01:30:58.864
This bloke here has made
you lot into a team.

01:30:59.204 --> 01:31:00.786
I'm buggered if I know how.

01:31:00.789 --> 01:31:03.873
But we are so close to nailing
another premiership plank

01:31:03.875 --> 01:31:07.289
on that gum tree, I
can smell the eucalypt.

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:10.083
Go on, smell it!

01:31:10.090 --> 01:31:12.047
Go on, smell it!

01:31:12.050 --> 01:31:13.712
Smell it!

01:31:13.718 --> 01:31:15.710
Now pull your heads in
and listen to your coach.

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:17.211
- Yeah.
- Come on, boys.

01:31:18.181 --> 01:31:19.467
- You heard the club custodian.

01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:22.638
All we gotta do to earn
a flag is...

01:31:22.644 --> 01:31:25.011
- Keep doing it
until we are not shit!

01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:49.336
- All clear.

01:31:52.549 --> 01:31:54.336
- All right, Porterhouse,
you're up.

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:57.005
Get in there, boy, get in there!

01:32:10.233 --> 01:32:11.565
- Another goal to Sayyid

01:32:11.568 --> 01:32:13.810
and the Roosters are now just a
kick away

01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:15.356
from an historic victory.

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:18.276
I tell ya what, this is the
best individual performance

01:32:18.283 --> 01:32:20.070
I've seen since one-armed Glenn
Farrell

01:32:20.076 --> 01:32:22.693
won the Wood chop at the Bodgy
Creek Show,

01:32:22.704 --> 01:32:25.697
came streaming down the
middle like the '93 floods.

01:32:26.249 --> 01:32:27.865
Lovely shepherd there from
Snapper.

01:32:27.876 --> 01:32:29.117
- Come on, mate!

01:32:29.127 --> 01:32:31.244
- And, he's
fended that fella off

01:32:31.254 --> 01:32:32.836
like he was made of balsam wood.

01:32:32.839 --> 01:32:34.956
Copy book 1-2 combo with Didier.

01:32:34.966 --> 01:32:36.707
He's running into the
open goal as the seconds

01:32:36.718 --> 01:32:38.960
tick down in the game,
and it hit the post.

01:32:39.888 --> 01:32:40.719
Bugger.

01:32:40.722 --> 01:32:41.963
That's disappointing.

01:32:41.973 --> 01:32:43.214
Well, with less than a
minute to go

01:32:43.224 --> 01:32:45.591
I reckon the Roosters have
time for one more play,

01:32:45.602 --> 01:32:46.888
but that's it.

01:32:46.895 --> 01:32:50.104
- It's not in our stars
to hold our destiny.

01:32:50.106 --> 01:32:51.563
It's in ourselves!

01:32:54.402 --> 01:32:55.563
- Here, mate.

01:33:13.755 --> 01:33:16.748
Mime handball, go!

01:33:24.766 --> 01:33:25.766
- Play on!

01:33:28.937 --> 01:33:30.178
Holding the ball.

01:33:32.107 --> 01:33:35.191
- What a terrific
tackle from Snapper.

01:33:35.193 --> 01:33:37.606
He's got a shot for
goal here and...

01:33:38.905 --> 01:33:41.022
Dear, siren's gone.

01:33:41.032 --> 01:33:44.116
Well, if Snapper kicks
this one, the Roosters win.

01:33:44.119 --> 01:33:45.610
- You got this, Snaps.

01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:47.407
- Goobs, Goobs, no, I can't do
this!

01:33:48.498 --> 01:33:50.034
Troy, I can't kick it that far.

01:33:51.626 --> 01:33:53.913
- Do you reckon you'd kick
a mime footy that far?

01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:56.461
- Yeah, easy.

01:33:56.464 --> 01:33:58.751
- That wasn't a mime bloke you
tackled.

01:33:58.758 --> 01:34:00.374
You'll be all right.

01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:03.631
Boys, boys, boys, boys, boys.

01:34:05.265 --> 01:34:07.973
All right, boys, it's time
to go old school refugee.

01:34:21.906 --> 01:34:25.070
- Come on, Snaps.

01:34:38.965 --> 01:34:39.965
- Moses!

01:35:17.003 --> 01:35:19.711
- The Roosters have premiered!

01:35:45.865 --> 01:35:48.152
- Smell the bloody eucalpyt!

01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:52.153
- Is my leprosy playing up?

01:35:52.163 --> 01:35:54.450
- Like you wouldn't believe.

01:35:55.917 --> 01:35:56.782
- Hey, time and a place, you
two.

01:35:56.793 --> 01:35:59.080
We've got a song to sing!

01:36:01.297 --> 01:36:04.586
♪ We're from Bodgy Creek ♪

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:16.764
♪ We're from Bodgy Creek ♪

01:36:16.771 --> 01:36:19.764
♪ We're never beat until
the final cock has crowed ♪

01:36:19.774 --> 01:36:20.764
♪ Cockadoo ♪

01:36:20.775 --> 01:36:23.609
♪ Like the Roosters of old,
we're fat and we're bald ♪

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:26.399
♪ For we're from Bodgy,
maroon, blue, and white ♪

01:36:26.406 --> 01:36:29.774
♪ For we're from Bodgy Creek ♪

01:36:37.583 --> 01:36:39.620
- So after being an
absolutely bullshit team

01:36:39.627 --> 01:36:42.085
for my whole life, the
Roosters have suddenly

01:36:42.088 --> 01:36:44.330
come good and won the
premiership.

01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:45.797
And that's not all!

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:48.793
Sayyid became the first
person to win a permanent visa

01:36:48.803 --> 01:36:52.217
and the League Best and
Fairest in the same season.

01:36:52.223 --> 01:36:54.806
Some TV producer heard about
Porterhouse

01:36:54.809 --> 01:36:57.347
and his legendary sweet
and sour Chicken Kiev

01:36:57.353 --> 01:36:59.595
and he ended up on the telly.

01:36:59.605 --> 01:37:02.188
Snapper and Didier's Cleano Noir
start up

01:37:02.275 --> 01:37:04.562
has really started to
kick goals.

01:37:04.569 --> 01:37:07.607
Once Tou finally stopped
using the pole as a spear,

01:37:07.613 --> 01:37:09.821
he became the best totem
tennis player

01:37:09.824 --> 01:37:12.157
to ever come out of Bodgy Creek.

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:13.867
Suresh's new club room design

01:37:13.870 --> 01:37:15.862
won him international
recognition.

01:37:15.872 --> 01:37:18.615
He's currently working on a
Taj Mahal-inspired rebuild

01:37:18.624 --> 01:37:21.082
of the Bodgy Creek Bowls Club.

01:37:21.085 --> 01:37:23.247
Harpo moved on from his
broken heart

01:37:23.254 --> 01:37:26.668
and went on to win the
Archibald Packer's Prize.

01:37:26.758 --> 01:37:30.092
Grandad really started to
embrace the changes around town.

01:37:30.094 --> 01:37:33.337
Sayyid has started to teach
him how to swear in Arabic.

01:37:33.348 --> 01:37:35.260
So how did my documentary end
up?

01:37:36.142 --> 01:37:37.474
Boo-yah!

01:37:37.477 --> 01:37:38.718
Thanks for asking.

01:37:38.728 --> 01:37:41.641
So how did Troy Carrington
go from being a Town Killer

01:37:41.647 --> 01:37:44.560
with no mates to a
Premiership Coach?

01:37:44.567 --> 01:37:45.978
Troy, how did you turn
that rabble

01:37:45.985 --> 01:37:48.022
into a not shithouse team?

01:37:48.029 --> 01:37:49.861
- Sorry, mate, do I know you?

01:37:49.864 --> 01:37:52.197
- This is gonna go at the
end of the documentary.

01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:53.407
- And you are?

01:37:53.409 --> 01:37:54.240
- Neil!

01:37:54.327 --> 01:37:55.613
- Not ringing any bells.

01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:57.156
- You're wrecking it.

01:37:57.163 --> 01:37:58.163
- Sorry, mate.

01:37:59.415 --> 01:38:01.031
- You're the worst, Troy,
and you always will be.

01:38:01.042 --> 01:38:02.374
- No, Nobby.

01:38:02.377 --> 01:38:03.377
Nobhead!
