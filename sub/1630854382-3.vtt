00:01.435 --> 00:02.903
[adult Adam] Back in the '80s,
yuppies were everywhere.

00:03.037 --> 00:06.140
They played douchey sports.
They called their brokers.

00:06.274 --> 00:08.609
And, of course, they ate sushi.

00:08.742 --> 00:11.445
And nobody wanted to be one
more than my brother Barry.

00:12.913 --> 00:15.483
Ugh! This is made from grapes?

00:16.484 --> 00:19.253
[grunts]
How do you win at this?

00:19.387 --> 00:22.290
Now everyone will know
I have class and money.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.592
[adult Adam] And the yuppie
trapping he coveted most?

00:24.725 --> 00:26.960
-[horn honks]
-The oh-so-sweet cars.

00:27.095 --> 00:28.596
Jealous JTP!

00:28.729 --> 00:30.331
[together] Jealous JTP!

00:30.464 --> 00:34.202
Matt Bradley, are you
so enraged with envy
that you cannot speak?

00:34.335 --> 00:36.870
Happy for you, Big Tasty.
Just not jealous.

00:37.004 --> 00:38.739
For me, wealth is measured
in experiences and--

00:38.872 --> 00:41.309
Ha ha! Hilarious! I like you.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.277
Where'd you get
that sweet ride, Bar?
You a hotel valet now?

00:43.411 --> 00:45.679
Close but way off, Naked Rob.

00:45.813 --> 00:47.881
My intimate
bedroom friend, Joanne,

00:48.015 --> 00:51.018
just landed
a sweet associate job
at this big law firm.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.221
And one of the perks
is a company car.

00:53.354 --> 00:54.855
Congrats, Joanne.
What's the job?

00:54.988 --> 00:57.625
Epstein Dybner Finkelman,
motherbrothers!

00:57.758 --> 00:59.227
EDF?

00:59.360 --> 01:01.629
They sued that teacher
in a wheelchair,
and they won her van!

01:01.762 --> 01:03.831
Their TV commercial is so cool!

01:03.964 --> 01:06.834
Who knew the legal team
behind big business
would be three old white guys?

01:06.967 --> 01:08.636
My dad said
if he'd gotten hired there,

01:08.769 --> 01:09.770
our life would have been
so much better.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.205
Like-- Like fix-my-foot better.

01:11.339 --> 01:13.274
I'm really doing it.

01:13.407 --> 01:17.611
But despite my full embrace
of the role of sugar child
to my sugar mama, don't worry.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.613
-I will still be your friend.
-What is happening?

01:19.747 --> 01:24.051
My lady got a high-paying job,
creating an uncomfortable
wealth gap between us.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.686
How can I make it any clearer?

01:25.819 --> 01:28.122
Now when we watch
Lifestyles of the Rich
and Famous,

01:28.256 --> 01:30.258
Barry gets it
at a whole new level.

01:30.391 --> 01:32.126
They're just people,
like you and me.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.394
-Yeah.
-But none of you.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.062
I've been thinking about
being really rich, too.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.964
-Ah, you won't. Face it.
-Aww. Hmm.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.768
The disparity
in our social classes
is the elephant in the zoo.

01:40.901 --> 01:43.837
But to reassure you
I won't leave
the three of you behind...

01:43.971 --> 01:45.906
-There's four of us.
-And where's the elephant?

01:46.039 --> 01:47.441
...I brought you a gift.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.210
Leftovers from
our upscale lunch.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.511
It's sushi.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.546
It's disgusting.
I had 36 pieces.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.115
Now go ahead, lowborn JTP,

01:55.249 --> 01:57.385
sample what you
will never sample again.

01:57.518 --> 02:00.188
-So fishy and chewy!
-The rice masks nothing!

02:00.321 --> 02:02.223
It's like that time at the lake
when the minnow
swam in my mouth!

02:02.356 --> 02:04.091
I taste the ocean's anger!

02:04.225 --> 02:06.327
All of this is cured by wasabi.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.929
-That's the green goo
in the corner of the box.
-Mm! My head is fire!

02:09.062 --> 02:11.131
-Oh, mercy! Make it stop!
-Why?

02:11.265 --> 02:12.466
Ohh! I need more fish
in my mouth!

02:12.600 --> 02:14.568
[all screaming]

02:15.703 --> 02:17.171
** I'm twisted up inside **

02:17.305 --> 02:20.574
** But nonetheless
I feel the need to say **

02:22.876 --> 02:24.445
** I don't know the future **

02:24.578 --> 02:28.015
** But the past keeps getting
Clearer every day **

02:28.148 --> 02:30.184
[adult Adam]
It was October 5th,
1980-something,

02:30.318 --> 02:34.422
and I had landed a job
on a real movie set
right here in Philadelphia.

02:34.555 --> 02:37.325
Yeah, I had a girlfriend.
Brea. She went to Brown.

02:37.458 --> 02:40.027
I see that look on your face,
but she was totally real.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.730
Anyway, with my dad's passing
and my sister having a baby,

02:42.863 --> 02:44.765
I opted to not go to NYU.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.835
Now here I am, about to clock
in at the ol' Dream Factory!

02:48.702 --> 02:49.870
Here's your post.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.171
It looks like a folding chair

02:51.305 --> 02:52.172
facing away
from all the action.

02:52.306 --> 02:53.173
Bingo.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.942
Not to toot my own horn,

02:55.075 --> 02:56.744
but I once should have won

02:56.877 --> 02:58.178
a film festival
at my high school.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.348
In that case, you wanna direct
the car chase tomorrow?

03:00.481 --> 03:01.849
Please and thank you!

03:01.982 --> 03:04.151
I'll need 50 Matchbox cars
to show the stunt coordinator

03:04.285 --> 03:05.219
exactly what my vision is.

03:05.353 --> 03:06.454
I'm messing with you,
Spielberg.

03:06.587 --> 03:07.621
Just make sure
no one steps in that hole.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.323
But isn't that the cone's job?

03:09.457 --> 03:11.492
You're a quick study.
Cone's in good hands.

03:12.760 --> 03:13.827
Also, don't sit.

03:14.562 --> 03:15.429
But there's a chair.

03:15.563 --> 03:16.630
Yeah, it was doing your job

03:16.764 --> 03:17.531
before you got here

03:17.665 --> 03:19.400
with all your dreams.

03:19.533 --> 03:22.002
[adult Adam]
And believe it or not,
it only got worse from there.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.871
[whimsical music playing]

03:26.874 --> 03:27.641
Oh!

03:29.910 --> 03:30.711
Ohh!

03:30.844 --> 03:31.645
...ninety-nine...

03:33.514 --> 03:35.916
and... 100.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.386
Let's go for a thousand.

03:38.519 --> 03:39.219
And that's when I decided

03:39.353 --> 03:41.822
not to go to NYU.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.724
One of the toughest decisions
of my life.

03:43.857 --> 03:46.794
Hey, you guys!

03:46.927 --> 03:48.862
Electric Company? Anyone?

03:48.996 --> 03:50.531
What was that? Sorry.

03:50.664 --> 03:51.932
I thought you said something.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.166
I haven't talked to anyone

03:53.301 --> 03:54.702
but this cone all day!

03:54.835 --> 03:56.437
[adult Adam] Yep, turns out
my first entertainment job

03:56.570 --> 03:57.838
wasn't very entertaining.

03:57.971 --> 04:00.674
That was until
a special guest star arrived.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.576
-Smile!
-Gah!

04:02.710 --> 04:04.745
Oh! There's my little
Hollywood superstar

04:04.878 --> 04:06.880
on the first
of many major motion pictures!

04:07.014 --> 04:08.882
[gasps] All dedicated to me!

04:09.016 --> 04:10.083
Oh, good, it's my mom

04:10.217 --> 04:11.452
definitely coming
to make everything better.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.586
I brought you soup.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.187
They have food here, Mom.

04:14.322 --> 04:15.289
At least I think they do.

04:15.423 --> 04:16.457
I'm not allowed in that tent.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.592
I don't want to interrupt
your life's work,

04:18.726 --> 04:20.227
so I'm just gonna
get out of your hair

04:20.361 --> 04:22.195
and go around introducing
myself to everybody.

04:22.330 --> 04:23.631
Absolutely not!

04:23.764 --> 04:26.099
Everybody's gonna know
you came from my body!

04:26.233 --> 04:27.301
Ooh, there's a guy
with a megaphone.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.235
Maybe he'll let me use it.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.570
-Hey!
-Damn it!

04:29.703 --> 04:31.071
I can't leave my cone!

04:31.204 --> 04:32.506
[adult Adam] As my job
couldn't get any worse...

04:32.640 --> 04:33.741
Ohh!

04:33.874 --> 04:35.309
...everything
about Joanne's job

04:35.443 --> 04:36.877
seemed like it couldn't get
any better.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.211
Mazel tov, Jo Jo Bear.

04:38.346 --> 04:39.613
Yeah!

04:39.747 --> 04:40.914
Such an impressive
accomplishment.

04:41.048 --> 04:43.884
-Thanks, Daddy.
-Epstein Dybner Finkelman.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.753
They're litigious monsters.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.788
They bankrupted
that children's charity.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.090
I'm so proud.

04:50.223 --> 04:52.092
Proud enough to serve up your
celebratory quiche right now?

04:52.225 --> 04:54.227
'Cause Baby and Mama
have a need to feed.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.295
Quiche is gross,

04:55.429 --> 04:56.697
but it's the kind of fancy food

04:56.830 --> 04:57.765
I should get used to

04:57.898 --> 04:59.132
now that my lady's
raking it in.

04:59.266 --> 05:00.401
I'm doing okay, I guess.

05:00.534 --> 05:01.669
Oh, please.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.236
You should see
Joanne's swanky office.

05:03.371 --> 05:04.438
So many books.

05:04.572 --> 05:05.839
She even has an assistant.

05:05.973 --> 05:06.974
Mrs. Thompson.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.709
But I hilariously
call her "Mrs. Thomas"

05:08.842 --> 05:10.478
after the famous
English muffins.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.446
I'm guessing no one
really heard about
my desire for wet eggs.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.348
I can now safely admit

05:14.482 --> 05:17.918
that there were times
when we thought
of Jo Jo as, well...

05:18.051 --> 05:20.120
-somewhat of a [bleep].
-Whoa!

05:20.253 --> 05:22.122
Sorry. It's just that
she was so flighty

05:22.255 --> 05:23.724
and never saw anything through.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.125
Well, that's all
in the past now.

05:25.258 --> 05:28.061
Seriously, my baby
is super hangry.
Quiche us, Linda.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.464
What about when Joanne
wanted to become a writer?

05:30.598 --> 05:33.033
That word processor
never made it out of the box!

05:33.166 --> 05:35.503
-We became writers
of so many checks.
-Mm-hmm.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.170
Sure. Coupl'a up-and-backs.

05:37.304 --> 05:38.706
Okay. I'm just
gonna go right in.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.141
Remember when she was going to
major in veterinary medicine?

05:41.274 --> 05:42.476
-Mm!
-[Lou] Do I?

05:42.610 --> 05:44.978
Day One: "Hello, Daddy?

05:45.112 --> 05:48.315
"Today I saw a sheep
with a nosebleed! I'm out!"

05:48.449 --> 05:49.983
-[laughter]
-Sheep are just like us.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.919
Come on.
Joanne's had her moments.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.321
Now that you're not
a financial anchor,

05:54.455 --> 05:57.157
we get to spend
our golden years in this house

05:57.290 --> 06:00.327
instead of a retirement home
where orderlies do stuff to us.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.596
The stakes were much higher
than any of us knew.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.297
-So proud.
-So proud.

06:04.432 --> 06:06.166
Thanks, Mom and Dad.

06:06.299 --> 06:07.535
-[laughter]
-[glasses clink]

06:07.668 --> 06:08.769
Are there bigger plates?

06:08.902 --> 06:10.604
[adult Adam] Yep,
Joanne had finally

06:10.738 --> 06:12.506
found something
she could stick with.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.974
Or so she thought.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.743
That's a lot of trees.
[chuckles]

06:15.876 --> 06:18.512
Don't worry. We represent
a client suing the EPA.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.013
We can kill
as many trees as we want.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.716
-Pbht! High five!
-Oh.

06:22.850 --> 06:26.019
Um, off of that, are we also
sometimes on the side of good?

06:26.153 --> 06:30.023
I'm somewhere in between
not understanding your question
and not really caring about it.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.492
High five.

06:31.625 --> 06:34.394
[percussive music playing]

06:34.528 --> 06:36.597
[adult Adam] While Joanne
was feeling out of touch
at her job,

06:36.730 --> 06:39.332
my job was making me
long for a sympathetic ear.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.639
[gasps] There's
my Francis Ford Schmoopola!

06:45.773 --> 06:49.543
Home so soon?
Why aren't you at Studio 54
with one of the Coreys?

06:49.677 --> 06:50.844
No Coreys.

06:50.978 --> 06:53.981
But I do have one new friend,
an orange cone!

06:54.114 --> 06:55.783
My job is so dull!

06:55.916 --> 06:58.018
I can't begin to tell you
all the things
that didn't happen.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.419
Then let's not force it.

06:59.553 --> 07:02.590
You always have a soft landing
right here in Mama's lap.

07:02.723 --> 07:05.826
As impossibly weird
as that offer
is to your adult son,

07:05.959 --> 07:07.294
there is somebody
I'd like to talk to.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.929
[dial tone]

07:09.062 --> 07:10.598
[dialing]

07:10.731 --> 07:12.733
So many beeps!

07:12.866 --> 07:14.468
You better not
be dialing Brea Bee.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.403
Why not? I had a lousy day.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.639
And up until a few weeks ago,
she was my girlfriend.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.208
Because you're gonna
come across as sad and needy

07:21.341 --> 07:23.711
while she struts across
her Ivy League campus.

07:23.844 --> 07:27.247
But right now,
I just need someone to talk to
that's not you.

07:27.380 --> 07:30.283
Heart shattered
into a million pieces.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.853
But, you know, there is
another option: Pop-Pop.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.154
He's a great listener.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.023
Pop-Pop,
wanna hear about my day?

07:36.156 --> 07:38.492
I vaguely heard my name,
and I didn't like it.

07:38.626 --> 07:41.562
Good luck with whatever
it is you do and are.

07:42.362 --> 07:43.564
And decision made.

07:43.697 --> 07:44.698
[dialing]

07:44.832 --> 07:45.799
[ringing]

07:45.933 --> 07:47.367
-Brea?
-Adam? Hi!

07:47.501 --> 07:48.401
What's going on?

07:48.536 --> 07:49.436
Ready on the set!

07:49.570 --> 07:52.105
And... action!

07:52.239 --> 07:55.709
Uh, apparently,
I'm still at work,
which I forgot to mention.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.410
Can you hold on a sec?

07:57.545 --> 07:58.879
What the heck are you doing?

07:59.012 --> 08:00.814
Rounding up to make you
sound more compelling!

08:00.948 --> 08:02.015
And... cut!

08:02.149 --> 08:03.984
Wow. You're really
doing the movie thing.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.253
Yeah,
I'm as surprised as you are.

08:06.386 --> 08:10.490
[deep voice] Hey, Adam,
it's sultry actress
Kathleen Turner.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.325
Whoa! Kathleen Turner's
in the movie, too?

08:12.459 --> 08:15.028
Apparently, there must
have been some recasting.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.397
I'll be with you in a minute,
Ms. Turner!

08:17.531 --> 08:19.833
You actually know her?
She was in Romancing the Stone!

08:19.967 --> 08:21.268
And now this for some reason.

08:21.401 --> 08:24.638
Adam, I really need you
to rewrite my lines.

08:24.772 --> 08:27.340
You're the only one
who understands my voice.

08:27.474 --> 08:30.310
-Which is super breathy
and so close to my face.
-Yeah.

08:30.443 --> 08:32.946
Wow. Jessica Rabbit really
seems to value your input.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.848
Yeah.
Be with you in a minute, KT!

08:34.982 --> 08:36.684
Adam, this is
so amazing for you.

08:36.817 --> 08:37.718
Everything's perfect.

08:38.586 --> 08:39.519
How are you doing?

08:39.653 --> 08:42.022
Equally good.
You know. College.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.958
New people, parties,
instant friends.

08:45.092 --> 08:47.327
-So you're really doing it?
-I really am.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.997
In fact,
I kind of have to go now.
My friends are waiting on me.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.666
-Oh, well--
-Adam, please hurry.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.234
I don't know
if I made this clear,

08:54.367 --> 08:56.704
but I'm movie star
Kathleen Turner.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.538
Great catching up!
Okay. Gotta go! Bye!

08:58.672 --> 09:01.541
I'm gonna ask you to do
something impossible,
which is...

09:01.675 --> 09:03.711
explain yourself, lady!

09:03.844 --> 09:05.145
[normal voice] She'll lose
interest in you

09:05.278 --> 09:07.347
if she thinks your life
is garbage now.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.383
But my life is garbage now.
This moment in particular!

09:10.517 --> 09:12.485
She doesn't have to know that.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.756
Why shouldn't she think
you're doing just as well
as she is?

09:15.889 --> 09:18.158
You know... [scoffs]
you are so lucky

09:18.291 --> 09:20.360
you've got such an
improvisationally gifted mama.

09:20.493 --> 09:21.895
[laughs]

09:22.029 --> 09:24.331
[adult Adam] While my mom's
meddling had laid me low,

09:24.464 --> 09:27.000
Barry was living high
on the hog of Joanne's job.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.136
How ya livin',
Nooks and Crannies?

09:29.269 --> 09:30.704
Barry Goldberg to see
Joanne Schwartz.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.906
Sure. My name kinda sounds like
a breakfast treat. Got it.

09:33.040 --> 09:36.043
[chuckles]
There's my working girl!

09:36.176 --> 09:38.779
How's your day?
But first answer this--

09:38.912 --> 09:40.580
Did you snag the firm's
Phillies tickets for tonight?

09:40.714 --> 09:42.382
-Oh, I forgot.
-Not a problem.

09:42.515 --> 09:43.450
But we should get there early,

09:43.583 --> 09:44.652
in case anyone
wants me to pitch.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.353
Sorry, Bar.
I don't think I can go.

09:46.486 --> 09:48.288
I-I still have so much
more work to do.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.923
Is your work more important

09:50.057 --> 09:52.192
than a late-season matchup
between two teams

09:52.325 --> 09:54.561
already eliminated
from playoff contention?

09:54.695 --> 09:58.165
Thing is, I-I'm just not sure
this job is everything
I hoped it would be.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.900
Did you find out that they also
don't have Flyers tickets?

10:00.033 --> 10:02.435
It's just
a lot more work, and...

10:02.569 --> 10:04.404
Remember when I wanted
to be a public defender?

10:04.537 --> 10:05.739
Ah!

10:06.707 --> 10:08.441
I see what's happening here.

10:08.575 --> 10:09.542
Oh. You do?

10:09.677 --> 10:10.944
And I know exactly
what you need.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.213
Oh. Phew. I was so afraid to--

10:13.346 --> 10:15.749
An epic Big Tasty pep talk.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.217
-Jo Jo...
-Mm-hmm.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.252
...owner of the lips
which whisper my name,

10:19.386 --> 10:21.789
you have to find a way
to dig deep.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.623
That's one way to go, I guess.

10:23.757 --> 10:26.259
Nose to the grindstone.
Elbow grease.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.461
Head down. Best foot forward.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.563
-All body parts
doing their thing.
-[chuckles]

10:30.698 --> 10:32.399
And I promise,
you'll get there.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.501
That's certainly what I want.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.070
Boom! See you tomorrow morning
when you come home to change.

10:41.374 --> 10:44.477
[adult Adam] Joanne had
started to feel her new job
might not be right for her,

10:44.611 --> 10:47.214
but she needed
a voice of experience
just to be sure.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.850
Hey, Jo.
If you're looking for Barry,
he went loafer shopping.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.251
Actually, I wanted
to talk to Erica.

10:51.384 --> 10:52.619
That's me. What's up?

10:52.753 --> 10:54.454
You're someone who's quit
a lot of things in her life.

10:54.587 --> 10:55.823
Oh, I don't think that's fair.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.859
Geoff, I am who I am,
it's fine. What's the issue?

10:58.992 --> 11:01.895
Did you ever think
about quitting something,
but you weren't sure you could?

11:02.029 --> 11:03.931
You came to the right place.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.599
Let me tell you
something about quitting.
It's harder than it looks.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.068
I know, right?

11:08.201 --> 11:09.903
I can only imagine
what my parents
are going to say.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.438
Yeah, you gotta tune that out.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.173
A good quitter
filters out the noise.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.342
But maybe if I just
hang in there--

11:15.475 --> 11:17.244
Bup-bup-bup. Do not talk
yourself out of quitting.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.112
Believe me,
there were plenty of times

11:19.246 --> 11:20.380
that I felt like
giving up on quitting.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.749
But I persevered.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.317
Your tone feels right,
but the words are so wrong.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.954
You're saying
if I think I want to quit,
don't give up and not quit?

11:27.087 --> 11:28.688
A true quitter
never doesn't quit.

11:28.822 --> 11:29.990
But I have
only been there a week.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.458
Well, you know what they say.

11:31.591 --> 11:34.627
"If at first you don't succeed,
pack it in, move on."

11:34.762 --> 11:36.029
They say the exact opposite!

11:36.163 --> 11:37.831
Look, I've been in your shoes.

11:37.965 --> 11:40.600
The road ahead looks tough,
and you're not sure
if you can make it.

11:40.734 --> 11:43.303
-I'm really not.
-But you got to
ask yourself something:

11:43.436 --> 11:46.039
Am I gonna quit this job
or am I gonna quit quitting?

11:46.173 --> 11:47.674
If I don't quit,

11:47.808 --> 11:49.442
I'll never know
what would have happened
if I did quit.

11:49.576 --> 11:53.146
Attagirl! Now you march
back into that office
with your head held high

11:53.280 --> 11:54.815
and you box up your stuff!

11:54.948 --> 11:56.649
Thank you, Erica.

11:56.784 --> 11:59.152
You have given me the strength
to not keep going.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.755
No one ever said
that taking the easy way out
is easy,

12:01.889 --> 12:03.490
but nothing worth doing
is hard.

12:03.623 --> 12:04.624
-Now go!
-Oh!

12:06.459 --> 12:08.695
Okay, as someone who's going
to raise a child with you,

12:08.829 --> 12:10.297
I have some
very serious concerns.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.065
Come on.
I turned out all right.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.401
And Joanne will, too. Probably.

12:14.534 --> 12:17.704
And speaking of not quitting,
get the lotion.
You're not done yet.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.073
[adult Adam] While Erica
had helped Joanne
find some direction...

12:20.207 --> 12:21.274
Thank you.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.943
...nothing
could have prepared me

12:23.076 --> 12:25.445
for the direction my evening
was about to take.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.746
'Sup, Goldnerd?

12:26.880 --> 12:28.715
Hey, guy whose name I forget.

12:28.849 --> 12:29.850
[Adam] Johnny and Carla?

12:29.983 --> 12:31.751
Surprise!

12:31.885 --> 12:36.423
[chuckles] Oh, that call
to your ex-girlfriend
was clearly a cry for help.

12:36.556 --> 12:39.692
Mama heard her lonely boy
and came up with a plan.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.862
You are gonna have adventures
right here at home.

12:41.995 --> 12:42.996
You're a townie now.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.531
Townie, please.

12:44.664 --> 12:47.400
I'm merely a temporary local
with eyes set on the big city.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.903
Nonsense. You're just
as untethered
and lost as these two.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.204
[chuckling] Yeah, we are.

12:51.338 --> 12:52.840
We're gonna show you
the local nightlife.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.374
Jenkintown after dark.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.010
I have previous plans
with Pop-Pop.

12:57.144 --> 13:00.080
Damn right he does. Now you get
those geisha hands over here.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.648
I'll get my coat.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.117
[adult Adam] I wasn't excited
to sample Jenkintown nightlife,

13:04.251 --> 13:05.752
but it was actually kinda fun.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.220
We had drinks...

13:07.354 --> 13:09.389
-Whiskey sour.
-Shot and a beer.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.758
Walk me through your
virgin margarita flavors.

13:11.892 --> 13:12.592
...we got shoes...

13:12.725 --> 13:14.594
-Size 8.
-11.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.396
Lady's 7.5.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.231
...and we bowled.

13:19.699 --> 13:22.035
That's, uh... zero for me.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.237
For a total of nine.
Great game, guys.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.840
Should we go home?

13:26.974 --> 13:29.609
But from there,
the rest of the night
was not exactly up my alley.

13:29.742 --> 13:31.144
-Trish! Over here!
-Ooh! Ooh-hoo!

13:31.278 --> 13:33.480
-Trish?
-Ooh-hoo! Hey, guys!

13:34.247 --> 13:36.316
Sorry. My sitter flaked.

13:36.449 --> 13:39.452
Adam Goldnerd,
meet Trish... something.

13:39.586 --> 13:40.820
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.255
-[chuckles]
-Who's this young fella?

13:42.389 --> 13:44.992
Ethan. Say hello to Adam.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.593
-Can I call him "Dad"?
-Sure.

13:46.726 --> 13:48.595
-What?
-Can you teach me
how to bowl, new Dad?

13:48.728 --> 13:49.829
Sure can.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.432
Oh, what an
impossible-to-answer question.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.267
Carla, is Trish
a friend of yours?

13:54.401 --> 13:56.803
She crashed into my car.
We kept in touch.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.039
We figured she's single,
you're single.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.574
Maybe through loneliness,
you can make some
bad decisions together.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.676
Well, you seem like
a lovely lady, Trish,

14:03.810 --> 14:06.846
and certainly nobody's asking,
"Is she too young for him?"

14:06.980 --> 14:09.082
Trish? What the hell?

14:09.216 --> 14:11.184
And who might this imposing,
irate gentleman be?

14:11.318 --> 14:12.385
Who are you, lame-ass?

14:12.519 --> 14:15.588
This is none of
your business, Wyatt!

14:15.722 --> 14:17.690
You and I
aren't a thing anymore.

14:17.824 --> 14:19.459
To be clear,
we're not a thing either.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.661
I'm just a very new
and very minor friend of Trish.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.263
He's going to take me fishing

14:23.396 --> 14:24.664
and be there
when he says he will!

14:24.797 --> 14:25.865
I never agreed to that!

14:25.999 --> 14:28.201
You know what?
I'm gonna end you.

14:28.335 --> 14:30.003
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Guys! Take it easy.

14:30.137 --> 14:31.471
I'll hold your glasses
while he whales on you.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.373
-Hold his shirt, too.
-My shirt?

14:33.506 --> 14:34.807
You got this, new Dad!

14:34.942 --> 14:36.643
Thanks for your confidence,
Ethan!

14:36.776 --> 14:38.445
It's time for everyone
to say good night to this punk!

14:38.578 --> 14:40.880
-Oh, look!
A compelling distraction!
-Where?

14:41.014 --> 14:42.482
[Adam] Thanks for
the memorable night!

14:42.615 --> 14:45.152
[adult Adam] I was done
with Jenkintown after dark.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.654
But things were about to get
pretty dark for Barry, too.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.222
Hey, Round Toast!

14:49.356 --> 14:51.324
I need the firm
to get me tickets

14:51.458 --> 14:52.692
to WrestleMania
at the Spectrum.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.027
Get out.

14:54.161 --> 14:57.530
As in "Get out of town,
I'm a wresting fan, too"?

14:57.664 --> 14:59.466
It isn't. Get out.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.669
[adult Adam] Turns out,
Barry's yuppie lifestyle
was coming to an end.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.837
Declined? How could that be?

15:04.972 --> 15:08.241
Are you telling me
I have to pay
for 19 volcano rolls

15:08.375 --> 15:09.842
out of my own Velcro'd wallet?

15:09.977 --> 15:13.846
Wait! Cease!
Do you know who I am?

15:13.981 --> 15:16.249
I'm the boyfriend of someone
who just started working

15:16.383 --> 15:18.751
for the firm
that leased this car!

15:18.885 --> 15:19.752
[grunts]

15:21.254 --> 15:23.690
Joanne,
we've got real problems.

15:23.823 --> 15:26.726
The company card doesn't work,
they took back the BMW,

15:26.859 --> 15:29.362
and Mrs. Thomas
stopped indulging
my cheeky antics!

15:29.496 --> 15:32.199
Well, that's 'cause...
I quit my job.

15:32.332 --> 15:35.768
What? Right before
the firm's golf outing?

15:35.902 --> 15:37.704
I really needed
that sporty getaway.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.072
You know what, Barry?

15:39.206 --> 15:41.241
I could have expected the job
to let me down.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.576
I didn't think you would, too.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.879
Oh. I don't understand.
What's happening?

15:47.014 --> 15:48.348
What's happening
is you're a moron.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.017
But I thought
she loved that job.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.618
Nope. Only you did.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.286
Did you really think
Joanne's goal in life

15:53.420 --> 15:54.921
was to help
rich people get richer?

15:55.055 --> 15:58.091
From your tone,
I'm guessing... no?

15:58.225 --> 15:59.759
You've been so consumed
with all the perks,

15:59.892 --> 16:01.494
you didn't realize
how miserable she was.

16:01.628 --> 16:05.398
Damn it. [sighs]
I have to make this right.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.967
[adult Adam] Barry
finally understood
what he needed to do.

16:08.101 --> 16:11.238
And I had someone I desperately
needed to see, Brea.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.206
One ticket
to Providence, please.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.742
But it turned out
I didn't need a ticket
to see Brea.

16:15.875 --> 16:16.443
[Brea] Adam?

16:18.611 --> 16:19.379
Brea?

16:19.512 --> 16:21.581
She had come to see me.

16:21.714 --> 16:22.715
[laughs]

16:26.253 --> 16:27.787
W-What are you doing here?

16:27.920 --> 16:29.956
I thought you were so busy
and happy at college.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.792
I... actually wasn't.

16:32.925 --> 16:34.761
Adam, I'm having
a pretty hard time.

16:34.894 --> 16:36.929
And then I heard
how you're thriving
in your new job--

16:37.064 --> 16:40.267
Let me stop you right there.
My life is pretty lousy, too.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.301
I thought you were friends
with Kathleen Turner?

16:41.434 --> 16:42.969
That was my mom's sultry voice.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.138
So you mean...
both our lives suck?

16:45.972 --> 16:47.707
Totally.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.676
[adult Adam] And so,
with neither of us
moving forward with our lives,

16:49.809 --> 16:52.445
Brea and I decided
to move backward, together.

16:52.579 --> 16:53.413
Brea.

16:53.546 --> 16:54.514
Hi, Mrs. G.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.015
I remember her.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.817
She didn't finish her chicken
when we took her to dinner.

16:57.950 --> 17:00.487
-Nice to see you, Pop-Pop.
-Brea, what are you doing here?

17:00.620 --> 17:02.021
Don't you have college
in the morning?

17:02.155 --> 17:03.256
Yeah, but, um--

17:03.390 --> 17:05.458
She might stay for a few days.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.261
-Or longer.
-Longer seems right.

17:08.395 --> 17:09.962
Or even longer than longer.

17:10.097 --> 17:10.897
[both chuckle]

17:12.632 --> 17:14.801
How do you like that?
The girl is throwing
her life away.

17:14.934 --> 17:16.469
Just like
she threw away that chicken.

17:16.603 --> 17:19.506
For Adam, Ben.
So everybody wins.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.109
Everybody who matters.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.477
It could work.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.481
Fine! I'll mix in!
Just shut up about it already!

17:31.951 --> 17:33.553
[adult Adam] Joanne
was about to face

17:33.686 --> 17:36.489
the hardest part
of quitting her job:
telling her parents.

17:36.623 --> 17:40.127
-You quit?
-Oh, Jo Jo.
I have to take a knee.

17:40.260 --> 17:44.231
I have to take two knees.
And two hands!

17:44.364 --> 17:47.200
Oh, I hope
you are happy, Joanne.
You made your father table-top.

17:47.334 --> 17:50.470
-W--
-Really, though,
is anyone surprised?

17:50.603 --> 17:53.740
Look, I know
you guys think I'm a flake,
but it wasn't like that.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.808
I want to be careful
not to overstate this.

17:56.976 --> 18:00.046
You destroyed
all of our futures!

18:00.180 --> 18:01.514
-[door closes]
-Opposite!

18:01.648 --> 18:03.683
Barry? What are you doing here?

18:03.816 --> 18:05.518
Setting the record straight.

18:05.652 --> 18:09.656
For some dumb reason,
your parents think
you don't see things through.

18:09.789 --> 18:12.459
I won't let them
make your quitting EDF
a source of shame

18:12.592 --> 18:14.093
when it should be
a source of pride.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.563
We should be proud that
she barely lasted a week?

18:16.696 --> 18:19.031
No. You should be proud
that she was smart enough

18:19.166 --> 18:21.434
to realize why she got into law
in the first place.

18:22.535 --> 18:23.836
She wanted to help people.

18:23.970 --> 18:26.105
["Missing You" plays]

18:26.239 --> 18:27.740
How did I not see it?

18:27.874 --> 18:29.041
I didn't at first, either.

18:29.176 --> 18:32.745
She was pushing paperwork
for a soulless firm,

18:32.879 --> 18:34.781
even though hers is the most
beautiful soul there is.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.784
I'm sorry, Jo Jo.

18:37.917 --> 18:42.855
I guess I just got excited
that you finally had a path.

18:42.989 --> 18:46.659
I do have a path, Daddy.
It's just not this.

18:46.793 --> 18:50.497
All we really care about
is that you're happy.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.699
** I ain't missing you at all **

18:52.832 --> 18:55.768
** Missing you, missing you **

18:55.902 --> 18:57.770
** Since you've been
Gone away... **

18:57.904 --> 19:00.573
And I know it's hard to believe
after the way I behaved,

19:00.707 --> 19:03.109
but that's all
I care about, too.

19:03.243 --> 19:06.346
You're not gonna miss
the car, the sushi,
or the Phillies tickets?

19:06.479 --> 19:07.880
[sighing] Oh, big time.

19:08.014 --> 19:10.417
But who knows
what the future will bring?

19:10.550 --> 19:14.587
So, when you think
about the future,
do you think about us?

19:15.455 --> 19:16.889
That's all I think about.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.258
** Down this
Long-distance line tonight **

19:18.391 --> 19:20.493
** I ain't
Missing you at all... **

19:20.627 --> 19:22.795
[adult Adam] Barry had come
to Joanne's rescue.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.332
Meanwhile, my mom
had someone else
she needed to save.

19:25.465 --> 19:26.599
Hey!

19:26.733 --> 19:29.969
Adam, Brea.
Your happiness is my happiness.

19:30.102 --> 19:31.238
Aww!

19:31.371 --> 19:33.540
Don't "aww" that.
She's clearly got more to say.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.942
It breaks my heart
how much you two
miss each other,

19:36.075 --> 19:39.446
but I think we all know
Brea can't stay.

19:39.579 --> 19:40.513
** Missing you... **

19:40.647 --> 19:42.114
It's just been so hard.

19:42.249 --> 19:45.585
Brea. It gets better.
A lot better.

19:45.718 --> 19:49.489
In fact, it should be
the best time of your life.
You deserve that.

19:49.622 --> 19:50.957
** I ain't missing you... **

19:51.090 --> 19:53.326
Damn it. You really do.

19:53.460 --> 19:54.394
I'll give you guys some time.

19:54.527 --> 19:56.162
** I keep lying to myself... **

19:56.296 --> 19:57.264
But, Adam, what about you?

19:58.130 --> 19:59.932
You're gonna figure it out.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.802
And... so will I.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.037
[adult Adam] Loving someone
means understanding

20:05.171 --> 20:06.706
exactly what
they're going through.

20:06.839 --> 20:07.807
If it's okay with you...

20:09.309 --> 20:11.544
can we just sit here
for a while?

20:11.678 --> 20:12.979
** Since you've been gone... **

20:13.112 --> 20:15.548
As long as you're here,
I'm not going anywhere.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.750
** I ain't missing you **

20:17.884 --> 20:19.151
** Missing you... **

20:19.286 --> 20:21.254
[adult Adam] And whether
it's space to grow apart

20:21.388 --> 20:23.523
or just a helping hand
as they find their way
through life...

20:25.625 --> 20:27.694
giving them
exactly what they need...

20:28.761 --> 20:30.196
** I ain't missing you... **

20:30.330 --> 20:31.564
...is the greatest gift of all.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.666
** I ain't missing you **

20:33.800 --> 20:36.035
** I keep lying to myself **

20:36.168 --> 20:37.937
** Ain't missing you **

20:38.070 --> 20:40.273
** I ain't missing you **

20:40.407 --> 20:42.409
** I ain't missing you **

20:42.542 --> 20:44.677
** I ain't missing you **

20:44.811 --> 20:46.846
** I ain't missing you **

20:48.815 --> 20:50.783
Gentlemen,
it is with a heavy heart

20:50.917 --> 20:53.286
I inform you I am no longer
ridiculously rich.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.921
-Wow.
-That happened fast.

20:55.054 --> 20:56.823
-Rags to riches to rags.
-It was clear
how this was gonna end.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.190
Which unfortunately means

20:58.325 --> 20:59.759
I'll be
in your lives after all.

20:59.892 --> 21:00.693
Slumming down here

21:00.827 --> 21:01.594
in the gutter

21:01.728 --> 21:02.562
with your cooked fish

21:02.695 --> 21:03.796
and American cars.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.298
Happy to have you back,
Big Tasty.

21:05.432 --> 21:07.400
And in celebration
of our reunion,

21:07.534 --> 21:10.403
I brought you one leftover
box of sushi to delight in.

21:10.537 --> 21:12.004
That does not look fresh.

21:12.138 --> 21:13.239
Nonsense!

21:13.373 --> 21:15.107
If sliced correctly,
sushi can last for weeks.

21:15.241 --> 21:16.576
Now gorge yourselves

21:16.709 --> 21:18.545
on the pizza rolls
of the Samurai!

21:18.678 --> 21:19.479
-No, thanks.
-I'm all set.

21:19.612 --> 21:20.780
I ate bacteria earlier.

21:20.913 --> 21:22.415
It's visually obvious
that shouldn't be eaten.

21:22.549 --> 21:23.616
More for me I guess.

21:24.784 --> 21:25.952
Mm.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.287
Ugh.

21:28.421 --> 21:29.956
Uh. I'm in really big trouble.
