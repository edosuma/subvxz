That's Khaled's sister Jada.

00:13.871 --> 00:15.691
You could come

No, I think this is

Early this morning,

03:15.209 --> 03:17.287
an NCIS protection detail
was attacked

03:17.356 --> 03:20.370
by a masked man driving
an unmarked SUV.

03:20.441 --> 03:22.899
They were transferring a
high-profile witness

03:22.970 --> 03:24.320
to a safe house.

03:24.390 --> 03:26.607
DEEKS:
Well, they certainly weren't

03:26.677 --> 03:27.751
discreet about it.

03:27.821 --> 03:30.383
Fortunately, there were
no casualties.

03:30.454 --> 03:32.013
Who was the witness?

03:33.988 --> 03:36.032
Jada Khaled.

03:39.082 --> 03:41.208
Is she all right?

03:41.273 --> 03:43.078

She's fine.

03:45.204 --> 03:46.332
for the Global Criminal
Tribunal officials

03:46.397 --> 03:49.102
was scheduled for
this afternoon.

03:49.168 --> 03:51.326
Our friend, Alex Elmslie has
been here in Los Angeles

03:51.391 --> 03:53.614
working with U.S.
officials on the case.

03:53.679 --> 03:55.354
Someone doesn't want Jada
giving up information

03:55.420 --> 03:57.997
on her brother's mass killings
in the Sudan.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.769
I'll give you three guesses
on who that is.

03:59.834 --> 04:01.155
What do we have on Khaled?

04:01.220 --> 04:03.540
Tahir Khaled is
currently in hiding.

04:03.604 --> 04:06.086
He last popped up on the grid
in Somalia, but the trail

04:06.152 --> 04:07.567
went cold a few weeks ago.

04:07.634 --> 04:09.558
Where is Jada now?

04:09.624 --> 04:12.046
Since the attack, she's been
under the GCT's protection

04:12.114 --> 04:13.971
at a safe house in Glendale.

04:14.039 --> 04:15.231
Anything on the SUV?

04:15.299 --> 04:16.524
I'm running it
through Kaleidoscope,

04:16.593 --> 04:17.886

04:17.952 --> 04:20.408
Nell, get in touch with Elmslie.

04:20.475 --> 04:21.702
He should have info on Khaled.

04:21.769 --> 04:23.693
Kensi and Deeks, talk to Jada.

Guy came out of nowhere,

04:56.586 --> 04:58.620
didn't have much time to react.

He gave up soon
as we opened fire on him.

05:01.290 --> 05:03.959
CALLEN: Doesn't exactly point
to a well-planned job.

05:04.026 --> 05:05.327

Preliminary questioning

05:08.798 --> 05:09.831

05:09.899 --> 05:12.300
Okay.

05:12.368 --> 05:13.902
Thanks.
You got it.

05:19.675 --> 05:23.144
It's not the best spot for
an assassination attempt.

05:23.211 --> 05:25.012

05:25.080 --> 05:28.649
two agents,
one escape route.

05:28.716 --> 05:30.617

screams amateur hour.

05:30.684 --> 05:33.686
Well, that or desperation.

05:49.502 --> 05:52.505
You know you're gonna have to
speak to her at some point.

05:52.572 --> 05:54.473
I know.

05:55.975 --> 05:57.277
They may have been amateurs,

05:57.343 --> 05:58.910
but they had some pretty
damn good intel

05:58.978 --> 06:02.114
on where Jada was gonna be
and when she was gonna be there.

06:03.717 --> 06:06.286
Somebody could be
feeding Khaled info.

06:06.353 --> 06:09.224
We need to talk to Elmslie.

06:15.198 --> 06:16.332
Jada?

06:16.399 --> 06:17.833
I'm Special Agent Kensi Blye,

06:17.901 --> 06:19.536
and this is Detective
Marty Deeks.

06:19.602 --> 06:22.337
I remember who you are.

06:26.542 --> 06:28.510
I know you've
had a tough morning,

06:28.578 --> 06:31.847
but we do need to ask
you some questions.

06:31.915 --> 06:34.316
Do you have any idea
who would do this?

06:39.222 --> 06:42.225
Do you think that your
brother would try to hurt you?

06:44.262 --> 06:46.996
I think you know
the answer to that.

06:49.300 --> 06:53.937
Has Khaled tried to get in
touch with you at all?

06:54.005 --> 06:55.639
He has not.

06:57.641 --> 07:01.177
Does your brother have
any contacts in the U.S.?

07:08.318 --> 07:10.153
He did, but...

07:10.220 --> 07:12.588
I do not know if
they are here anymore.

07:12.656 --> 07:14.558
You got a name for us?

07:18.228 --> 07:19.595
Bakri.

07:19.663 --> 07:22.665
Absalom Bakri.

07:24.335 --> 07:26.937
(auto-dial beeping, line rings)
Thank you.

07:27.004 --> 07:28.706
CALLEN (over phone):
What do you got?

07:28.774 --> 07:30.509
SAM:
Any luck on Khaled?

07:30.577 --> 07:31.709
Not yet.
Thanks, Kens.

07:31.777 --> 07:33.077
All right, Khaled had
a U.S. Operative.

07:33.145 --> 07:35.447
Absalom Bakri--
B-A-K-R-I.

07:35.514 --> 07:37.550
Let me see what I can dig up.
NELL: Guys?

07:37.618 --> 07:39.252
Elmslie hasn't
reported in today.

07:39.320 --> 07:41.319
He rents a house here
in Los Feliz with his family.

07:41.387 --> 07:43.454
No answer there
and no one with the GCT

07:43.522 --> 07:45.791
has heard from him
in the last 24 hours.

07:45.858 --> 07:47.926
Elmslie is missing.

08:06.193 --> 08:09.294
Elmslie's cars are still here.

08:09.362 --> 08:11.947
They're cold.

08:15.910 --> 08:16.916
(banging on door)

08:16.985 --> 08:18.696
Federal Agents!

08:21.921 --> 08:22.960
Elmslie?

08:23.030 --> 08:25.042
It's Sam and Callen.

08:31.222 --> 08:33.134
Side door's open.

08:33.203 --> 08:35.217
So was the front door.

08:39.650 --> 08:41.092
Clear.

08:42.772 --> 08:43.744
Clear.

08:43.813 --> 08:44.920
Clear.

08:44.988 --> 08:47.001
DEEKS:
All clear.

08:53.281 --> 08:55.730
No sign of forced entry
or struggle.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.497
Something doesn't
feel right.

08:59.557 --> 09:02.305
SAM:
Looks like they left in a hurry.

09:02.366 --> 09:03.966
But they didn't take their cars.

09:04.027 --> 09:05.113
Cab to the airport?

09:06.473 --> 09:09.915
Eric, see if there's any airline
reservations under their names.

09:09.976 --> 09:11.185
Also, pull up their cell phones.

09:11.245 --> 09:12.724
Maybe Elmslie thought
his family was in danger

09:12.785 --> 09:14.687
because of the attack on Jada,
decided to move them.

09:14.748 --> 09:16.318
Or they actually
could be in danger.

09:16.379 --> 09:17.555
CALLEN:
Eric?

09:17.617 --> 09:20.485
No plane tickets and both
Elmslie and his wife's

09:20.546 --> 09:22.010
cell phones are turned off.

09:24.626 --> 09:26.092
KENSI:
What do we have here?

09:28.604 --> 09:29.614
Huh.

09:29.686 --> 09:31.568
Solves that mystery.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.661
Eric, we got the
cell phones here.

09:33.732 --> 09:34.525
ERIC: Perfect.

09:34.551 --> 09:36.136
They could've ditched them
before they took off.

09:36.418 --> 09:39.557
Maybe somebody else ditched them
so they couldn't be tracked.

09:39.628 --> 09:40.883
Eric,

09:40.954 --> 09:43.535
look at everyone Elmslie
spoke to in the last 48 hours.

09:43.605 --> 09:45.489
Texts, e-mails,
cell phones, everything.

09:45.560 --> 09:47.895
(Eric typing,
computer blipping rapidly)

09:49.328 --> 09:53.444
All right,
from the looks of it...

09:53.514 --> 09:55.013
Elmslie spent
the majority of his time

09:55.084 --> 09:56.829
at the Federal Building
on Wilshire.

09:56.899 --> 09:59.445
Other than calls to his wife,

09:59.515 --> 10:03.912
most of his communication is
with GCT Officer Daryl Marru.

10:03.983 --> 10:05.830
Huh.

10:05.900 --> 10:07.309
Elmslie and Marru
have been working closely

10:07.377 --> 10:09.959
with U.S. authorities
on the Khaled case.

10:10.028 --> 10:12.442
NELL: Got a hit on
Absalom Bakri.

10:12.510 --> 10:15.395
Took a little digging, but it
looks like he's been operating

10:15.463 --> 10:17.777
under a few false identities,

10:17.845 --> 10:19.187
one of which is attached
to a lease

10:19.254 --> 10:20.897
on a warehouse
in Koreatown.

10:20.966 --> 10:23.582
All right, Eric, see if
Hetty can talk to Marru

10:23.649 --> 10:25.326
and find out if he's
heard from Elmslie.

10:25.394 --> 10:28.112
Kensi, Deeks,
talk to Bakri.

10:28.180 --> 10:31.233
Sending Bakri's address and
photos your way.

10:31.301 --> 10:33.112
You get a hit on that SUV?

10:33.180 --> 10:34.404
Kaleidoscope's got nothing.

10:34.473 --> 10:36.070
You'd think that a car
with front-end damage

10:36.139 --> 10:37.193
and bullet holes
in the windshield

10:37.261 --> 10:38.246
would make this easier.

10:38.316 --> 10:40.729
This is L.A.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.635
Maybe they're just laying low.

10:42.703 --> 10:44.709
- Hm. Or maybe they just switched cars.
S- witched cars.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.443
Jinx. You owe me a soda.

10:46.512 --> 10:48.348
What?! I never played
with soda rules.

10:48.417 --> 10:50.219
I always played
with dead arm rules.

10:50.287 --> 10:51.306
What's dead arm?

10:51.376 --> 10:52.497
Dead arm.

10:52.566 --> 10:55.524
Aah!
(clears throat)

10:55.593 --> 10:57.632
I like soda rules better.

10:57.700 --> 10:58.866
Mama.

10:58.932 --> 11:00.519
Are you okay?

11:00.585 --> 11:01.719
(clears throat)
Yeah. No, totally.

11:01.785 --> 11:04.020
I was... I was just...
I wasn't ready.

11:05.577 --> 11:07.489
I can't feel my fingers.

11:07.555 --> 11:08.623
We've all been there.

11:08.690 --> 11:10.245
You did what
you had to do.

11:10.311 --> 11:11.411
For the greater good?

11:11.477 --> 11:12.741
Yeah, for the
greater good.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.200
You saw the grave.

11:14.266 --> 11:16.112
We were taking down
a mass murderer.

11:16.178 --> 11:17.960
And yet Jada's the one
who's locked up

11:18.026 --> 11:19.160
and was almost
killed today.

11:19.226 --> 11:20.619
Sam, you did
the right thing.

11:20.684 --> 11:22.045
Did I?

11:22.111 --> 11:25.157
Look, Saddam, Qaddafi-- they all
end up in a hole in the ground.

11:25.223 --> 11:27.588
Hell, even Hitler
died in his bunker.

11:27.654 --> 11:31.446
You and me-- we're putting
Khaled in that hole.

11:31.512 --> 11:33.163
HETTY:
Gentlemen?

11:34.299 --> 11:36.009
Elmslie told Marru

11:36.077 --> 11:39.393
he was going out of town
for a few days with his family.

11:39.463 --> 11:42.471
But the hotel name
Elmslie left him

11:42.541 --> 11:44.489
doesn't seem to exist.

11:44.559 --> 11:46.234
What was the name he gave him?

11:46.302 --> 11:47.123
The Desert Jewel.

11:47.192 --> 11:48.662
They can't find it

11:48.731 --> 11:50.339
because it's not there.

11:50.407 --> 11:51.604
It's in Khartoum.

11:51.674 --> 11:53.760
That's the hotel
I stayed in with Jada.

11:53.830 --> 11:55.744
It could be Elmslie
asking for help.

11:55.813 --> 11:58.959
Or warning us
to back off.

11:59.029 --> 11:59.096
KENSI: <i>All right, this is the</i>
<i>warehouse Bakri's leasing.</i>

12:04.023 --> 12:05.185
(sniffing)

12:05.254 --> 12:07.373
Smells like
a roller rink out here.

12:07.443 --> 12:09.448
Who goes to a
roller rink?

12:09.516 --> 12:11.020
You never went as a kid?

12:11.087 --> 12:12.659
- (laughs) No.
- How do you not go?

12:12.727 --> 12:15.601
You're talking about,
uh, you know,

12:15.669 --> 12:18.443
arcade games, disco balls,
couples skates.

12:18.510 --> 12:19.814
Hey, triples skate.

12:19.882 --> 12:21.218
Well, I was just more

12:21.286 --> 12:22.791
into building campfires
and going fishing.

12:22.859 --> 12:24.261
That's right; you
were the poster girl for

12:24.329 --> 12:25.766
the Tomboys for America.
I forgot.

12:25.834 --> 12:27.773
Uh, actually, I was
just outdoorsy.

12:27.840 --> 12:29.076
Know who else
is outdoorsy--

12:29.145 --> 12:30.548
Labrador Retrievers.

12:30.616 --> 12:33.157
I don't know why I bother
talking to you sometimes.

12:33.225 --> 12:35.296
Real question is: do you
think you were born a tomboy,

12:35.364 --> 12:37.503
or you become one because
your dad really wanted a son?

12:38.541 --> 12:40.224
You did not just say that.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.313
No... no, no, no, that...
that came out wrong.

12:42.382 --> 12:44.368
I was just asking the
classic question of nature

12:44.437 --> 12:45.917
versus nurture-- aah!

12:45.987 --> 12:47.231
(grunts and coughs)

12:47.300 --> 12:49.758
Shh.
Oh. Yeah, no, no.

12:49.827 --> 12:51.780
That's definitely genetic.

12:51.849 --> 12:53.464
Oh, man. Wow. Really?

12:53.533 --> 12:55.856
Think you might be packing
an extra Y chromosome there,

12:55.925 --> 12:57.372
Ms. Klinefelter.
(whispers): Are you ready?

13:02.795 --> 13:04.815
(various indistinct
conversations, phones ringing)

13:12.598 --> 13:16.202
Federal agents!
Don't move!

13:16.270 --> 13:16.336
KENSI: I'll take the back!
No. No!

13:31.398 --> 13:33.150
Oh-ho! Snap!

13:37.531 --> 13:39.316
Calf-roping
champion?

13:40.800 --> 13:43.225
Yee-haw.

13:51.800 --> 13:54.250
No more questions
until I get a lawyer.

13:54.317 --> 13:56.072
You might want to
get two lawyers.

13:56.138 --> 13:59.184
One for a credit card scam,
and one for the attempted murder

13:59.251 --> 14:00.905
of a federal witness
and two agents.

14:00.972 --> 14:02.890
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:02.959 --> 14:04.580
SAM:
Which part?

14:04.647 --> 14:06.402
The illegal funding of Khaled's
terrorist operation,

14:06.468 --> 14:08.388
or trying to
kill his sister?

14:08.455 --> 14:10.143
Khaled who?

14:10.210 --> 14:11.532
I'm a businessman.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.155
I never tried
to kill anyone.

14:13.223 --> 14:14.546
This is racial profiling.

14:14.613 --> 14:16.633
Now, you want
to arrest me, go ahead.

14:16.700 --> 14:19.611
Your jails are so overcrowded,
I'll be out by lunchtime.

14:21.554 --> 14:23.126
That's what
I thought.

14:23.194 --> 14:24.967
Sit the hell down!

14:25.035 --> 14:27.947
Get your hands off me unless
you want an assault charge.

14:28.014 --> 14:29.821
I'll take the charge.

14:29.889 --> 14:31.061
CALLEN:
Sam?

14:31.128 --> 14:33.069
Sam!

14:33.138 --> 14:35.211
(panting)

14:41.072 --> 14:42.778
(panting)

14:42.846 --> 14:46.829
Your partner...
has anger issues.

14:46.898 --> 14:48.838
He'll be hearing
from my lawyer.

14:48.906 --> 14:50.378
I didn't say
you could leave.

14:50.445 --> 14:51.751
You can't hold me here.

14:51.818 --> 14:54.561
What, you didn't check
your terrorist manual?

14:54.630 --> 14:56.905
I can keep you here,
and I will keep you here.

14:56.973 --> 14:58.245
Hell, I'll send you
to Guantanamo Bay

14:58.313 --> 14:59.718
if I want. Now, sit down.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.020
(door opening)

15:14.583 --> 15:16.554
What's he doing?

15:16.622 --> 15:18.825
SAM:
I got questions.

15:18.893 --> 15:21.697
You're going to give me answers
one way or another.

15:21.765 --> 15:25.238
He-He can't...
he-he can't do this!

15:25.306 --> 15:26.775
Aren't you going
to stop him?

15:26.843 --> 15:28.346
This is against the law!

15:28.413 --> 15:31.116
So are credit card scams
and attempted murder.

15:31.184 --> 15:32.620
I never tried
to kill anyone!

15:32.687 --> 15:34.625
Well, somebody tried to
kill Jada this morning.

15:34.692 --> 15:36.795
It wasn't me.
I swear.

15:36.862 --> 15:39.033
I was in my apartment.
I have witnesses.

15:39.100 --> 15:41.005
When was the last time
you talked to Khaled?

15:44.179 --> 15:45.844
How long ago?

15:48.313 --> 15:50.912
Three weeks! Three weeks.

15:50.979 --> 15:52.712
He order a hit
on his sister?

15:52.779 --> 15:54.046
No.

15:54.113 --> 15:56.314
Why would he do that?

15:57.981 --> 16:00.214
She's testifying against him
for war crimes.

16:00.282 --> 16:02.881
I don't know anything
about this.

16:02.949 --> 16:04.116
Where is Khaled?

16:04.183 --> 16:07.082
Last I heard, he was in Somalia.

16:07.150 --> 16:09.583
I swear.

16:19.018 --> 16:20.953
What do you think?

16:21.020 --> 16:22.887
I think you scared
the hell out of him.

16:22.955 --> 16:24.589
In fact, you were
starting to scare me.

16:24.656 --> 16:26.557
That was the point.

16:26.625 --> 16:28.659
Point taken, but assuming
he's telling the truth,

16:28.727 --> 16:31.061
we got a problem.
Yeah.

16:31.130 --> 16:33.863
Outside of Khaled, who else
would want to kill Jada?

16:33.931 --> 16:35.232
Any enemies would
want her alive,

16:35.298 --> 16:37.066
to better the chances of
Khaled being indicted.

16:37.134 --> 16:38.902
Well, unless it's not one
of his enemies.

16:38.970 --> 16:41.671
Maybe it was one
of his old friends trying

16:41.739 --> 16:44.508
to bury their relationship,
so they don't go down with him.

16:44.575 --> 16:46.510
Hmm.

16:46.577 --> 16:48.545
But what's the connection
to Elmslie?

16:54.718 --> 16:56.261
Did you find anything
on Bakri's laptop?

16:56.329 --> 16:57.638
Still working on it.

16:57.706 --> 16:59.416
Now that Khaled's IP
is off the grid,

16:59.484 --> 17:00.893
it doesn't really
do me any good.

17:00.961 --> 17:03.443
I mean, if he was online,
we could run a trace route

17:03.512 --> 17:04.921
through the log files
on Bakri's computer.

17:04.989 --> 17:06.935
Got a hit on our SUV
from the roof.

17:07.002 --> 17:08.078
Where?

17:08.146 --> 17:09.424
Downtown.

17:09.492 --> 17:11.240
Here's the video footage.

17:13.494 --> 17:16.150
This is five minutes ago.

17:16.219 --> 17:18.099
CALLEN:
Alex Elmslie?

17:18.169 --> 17:19.714
SAM:
Doesn't make sense.

17:19.782 --> 17:22.137
KENSI:
Unless...

17:22.204 --> 17:25.468
Elmslie's been playing us
all along.

17:25.535 --> 17:27.182
Maybe he used us

17:27.251 --> 17:29.873
to get Jada into the country
for his own purposes.

17:29.941 --> 17:31.522
The building
they're entering is owned

17:31.589 --> 17:33.404
by a legitimate
commercial developer.

17:33.474 --> 17:34.549
It's still under renovation.

17:34.617 --> 17:35.558
Right there.

17:35.625 --> 17:36.735
What-What
are they looking at?

17:36.803 --> 17:39.065
Can you give us a shot
of the street, Eric?

17:39.133 --> 17:41.461
(scoffs) Can I give you
a shot of the street? Hello.

17:47.052 --> 17:48.748
CALLEN:
Nothing really of note.

17:48.816 --> 17:52.707
Eric, go back to when he pointed
and zoom in, would you?

17:52.775 --> 17:54.338
ERIC:
And... there we go.

17:54.405 --> 17:57.299
DEEKS:
What is he saying?

17:57.366 --> 18:00.459
He's saying,
"Welcome to Hollywood."

18:00.528 --> 18:02.190
He was pointing
at the Hollywood sign.

18:02.258 --> 18:04.119
So Elmslie's giving star tours?

18:04.187 --> 18:05.949
He knows he's
on camera.

18:06.017 --> 18:07.114
He's pointing
at the Hollywood sign

18:07.182 --> 18:08.278
to get the others
on camera, too.

18:08.345 --> 18:09.609
Why would he do that?

18:09.677 --> 18:11.142
I think he did it for us.

18:11.210 --> 18:12.474
Run these guys.

18:12.542 --> 18:13.807
We're headed downtown.

18:13.875 --> 18:14.974
ERIC & NELL:
Good luck.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.038
Jinx. That's two.

18:45.227 --> 18:47.125
Federal Agents!
Stay where you are!

18:47.193 --> 18:48.424
Kensi, Deeks, third floor.

18:48.492 --> 18:50.357
Callen. Sam.

18:50.425 --> 18:51.856
Hands where we can see 'em!

18:51.924 --> 18:53.955
I'm sorry.

18:55.256 --> 18:58.919
Alex... what's going on?

18:58.987 --> 19:00.818
They took my family.

19:00.886 --> 19:03.184
Said they'd kill them
if I didn't kill Jada.

19:03.251 --> 19:04.120
Who?

19:04.188 --> 19:06.023
I don't know who they are.

19:06.091 --> 19:07.994
I was hoping
you could find out.

19:08.062 --> 19:09.965
I'm assuming
they work for Khaled.

19:10.033 --> 19:11.735
That's why
you put them on camera.

19:13.106 --> 19:14.340
Where are they now?

19:14.408 --> 19:16.979
Left just before you got here.

19:17.047 --> 19:18.348
You tried to
kill Jada?

19:18.417 --> 19:22.357
I had to make it look like
a real assassination attempt.

19:22.425 --> 19:24.829
It was just
to buy me some time.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.866
You come in with us.
We can help you.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.369
Too risky.

19:28.437 --> 19:30.172
They could still be
watching me.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.644
I've already endangered my
family just by talking with you.

19:32.712 --> 19:33.647
Why you?

19:33.715 --> 19:35.184
Payback.

19:35.251 --> 19:36.519
For me and you.

19:36.587 --> 19:38.924
They knew I'd have
access to her.

19:38.991 --> 19:41.530
CALLEN: You can't do this
on your own, Elmslie.

19:41.597 --> 19:42.741
Stop!

19:42.810 --> 19:43.886
CALLEN:
He's got a grenade!

19:43.955 --> 19:45.638
Oh, come on! Who does that?

19:45.707 --> 19:48.265
I appreciate your help,
but I can't come in with you.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.455
I only have 12 hours
to find my family.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.632
What if you can't?

19:51.701 --> 19:53.519
I don't have much of a choice.

19:53.587 --> 19:55.608
Are you really prepared
to kill Jada?

19:58.202 --> 20:00.357
Please don't try to follow me.

20:00.426 --> 20:01.974
I'm sorry.

20:03.492 --> 20:04.838
(grunting)

20:09.084 --> 20:11.001
It's only a smoke grenade.

20:18.010 --> 20:20.974
(engine starting)

20:24.344 --> 20:26.397
(tires squealing)

20:26.465 --> 20:29.261
Clever little bastard.

20:40.765 --> 20:42.272
ERIC: We've got a hit
on Elmslie's guys.

20:42.483 --> 20:43.998
NELL:
It's an interesting group.

20:44.067 --> 20:45.999
We've identified
three so far.

20:46.070 --> 20:48.933
These two are former DGSE.

20:49.004 --> 20:50.903
SAM: French External
Intelligence Agency?

20:50.972 --> 20:52.732
CALLEN:
Why are former French

20:52.801 --> 20:54.562
spooks working with Khaled?

20:54.631 --> 20:56.115
What are former
French operatives doing

20:56.186 --> 20:57.531
in this country, period?

20:57.601 --> 20:59.326
Yeah, you'd think they would
have learned their lesson

20:59.396 --> 21:00.777
after Kensi kicked one
of their <i>freres</i>

21:00.847 --> 21:02.435
in the croissants
the last time we met.

21:02.504 --> 21:04.817
You know it.
Who's the third guy?

21:04.886 --> 21:06.403
That would be Adrien Montalban.

21:06.474 --> 21:09.234
He lives in Prague,
but he's also a French citizen.

21:09.305 --> 21:10.512
Runs a legitimate
consulting firm.

21:10.583 --> 21:11.663
Montalban International.

21:11.729 --> 21:13.071
They offer a wide variety

21:13.137 --> 21:16.412
in business and career advice
for multinational corporations,

21:16.479 --> 21:18.115
politicians,
startups, you name it.

21:18.182 --> 21:19.688
They have branches
all over the world,

21:19.755 --> 21:21.097
including Los Angeles.

21:21.163 --> 21:23.749
Unfortunately, their data
servers are in a private cloud.

21:23.816 --> 21:26.108
We'd have to be on-site
to access anything,

21:26.175 --> 21:28.434
assuming we had a warrant,
of course.

21:28.501 --> 21:29.842
Of course.

21:29.909 --> 21:31.415
SAM: Bakri didn't think
Khaled had anything to do

21:31.481 --> 21:32.726
with the attack on Jada.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.543
But Elmslie thinks these guys
are working with Khaled.

21:35.610 --> 21:37.311
You think
they have Elsmlie's family?

21:37.378 --> 21:38.639
I don't know.

21:38.708 --> 21:40.501
Maybe it's time
to go to the source.

21:40.568 --> 21:42.329
Who's the source?
Khaled.

21:42.396 --> 21:43.957
But we don't know where he is.

21:44.025 --> 21:45.354
Yeah, but if Bakri is
working with Khaled,

21:45.420 --> 21:47.314
he obviously has a way
to get in touch with him.

21:47.380 --> 21:48.310
Yeah, even if he does,

21:48.378 --> 21:49.705
he would never
tell us.

21:49.773 --> 21:51.334
I think he might.

21:51.402 --> 21:54.259
Kens, if Hetty can get you a
warrant, you think you and Deeks

21:54.326 --> 21:55.489
can get into
Montalban International?

21:55.556 --> 21:57.084
Oh!

21:57.152 --> 21:58.647
<i>Bien sur, mon ami.</i>

21:58.713 --> 21:59.843
<i>Pas de problem.</i>

21:59.910 --> 22:01.904
I love it
when you talk dirty.

22:06.725 --> 22:09.127
Looks like you're packing
or going hunting.

22:09.194 --> 22:10.261
Oh, no, no, no.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.330
Just routine maintenance.

22:12.398 --> 22:14.433
Right.

22:14.501 --> 22:18.103
So we need an expedited
covert entry search warrant

22:18.171 --> 22:19.638
for Montalban International.

22:19.706 --> 22:22.707
Mm. I'll make a call.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.275
How's your partner?

22:24.343 --> 22:26.778
He's good.

22:26.846 --> 22:31.048
Not, uh, on the verge
of waterboarding anyone?

22:31.116 --> 22:33.984
Of course not.

22:34.052 --> 22:36.453
There's a lot at
stake, Mr. Callen.

22:36.521 --> 22:40.859
It's not just Jada
whose life is on the line.

22:40.927 --> 22:43.928
Now Sam has the lives
of Elmslie and his family

22:43.996 --> 22:45.664
hanging over
his head.

22:45.732 --> 22:48.566
We are all concerned about them.

22:48.634 --> 22:51.123
Yes, I know.

22:53.578 --> 22:57.594
But you don't
blame yourself for this.

22:57.661 --> 23:02.374
Sam would do anything to save
Jada and Elmslie's family.

23:04.398 --> 23:07.583
Even if it means
sacrificing his own life.

23:09.610 --> 23:13.127
You really need to
be extra careful.

23:13.194 --> 23:15.219
For both of you.

23:15.286 --> 23:16.845
I will.

23:30.621 --> 23:32.876
Ugh, office buildings
make me nauseous.

23:32.944 --> 23:34.270
What do you got, Nell?

23:34.337 --> 23:36.196
NELL: Okay, you need to get
to the server room.

23:36.263 --> 23:37.556
It's located
on the second floor.

23:37.623 --> 23:40.012
Get a cell phone connected
to one of the hubs in there,

23:40.079 --> 23:41.705
and we should be able
to copy their database.

23:41.772 --> 23:43.994
I'm sending floor plans
to your tablet now.

23:44.061 --> 23:45.886
Copy that.

23:45.953 --> 23:48.034
These things make me
feel like I'm in a noose,

23:48.101 --> 23:51.107
but... good God, do
I look breathtaking.

23:51.174 --> 23:52.529
Oh.

23:52.596 --> 23:54.280
I prefer you in a noose.

23:54.348 --> 23:56.296
Oh, a little
bondage play?

23:56.364 --> 23:58.478
Really? You naughty
little librarian.

23:58.545 --> 24:00.229
Where do you guys get this from?

24:00.296 --> 24:01.552
Ugh. Okay.

24:01.619 --> 24:03.734
How do you want to play it?
Pope in the Pool?

24:03.802 --> 24:04.957
With a Swedish Handoff?

24:05.024 --> 24:06.709
You suck at
the Swedish Handoff.

24:06.776 --> 24:08.725
Are you kidding me?
I practically invented it.

24:08.792 --> 24:11.699
Certainly
perfected it.

24:13.717 --> 24:14.939
Oh.

24:15.006 --> 24:16.558
Good afternoon...

24:16.626 --> 24:18.113
Maribel.

24:18.180 --> 24:19.223
Welcome to
Montalban International.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.571
How can I help you?

24:20.639 --> 24:21.581
Christopher Stone.

24:21.650 --> 24:22.997
Stone Electronic
Solutions.

24:23.064 --> 24:25.118
SES, if you want
to be quick about it.

24:25.187 --> 24:27.208
Good afternoon, Mr. Stone.

24:27.276 --> 24:28.387
Indeed it is.

24:28.456 --> 24:30.106
Only thing that could
possibly make it better

24:30.174 --> 24:31.420
is my meeting with Montalban.

24:31.487 --> 24:33.475
That and maybe seeing
that beautiful smile one more--

24:33.543 --> 24:35.260
And there it is.

24:35.329 --> 24:37.420
I'm afraid Mr. Montalban
is unavailable this afternoon.

24:37.489 --> 24:39.277
Are you sure you have
the right time?

24:39.345 --> 24:40.829
110% sure.

24:40.898 --> 24:42.820
In fact, if you could just
check your records again,

24:42.888 --> 24:44.576
I'm sure I'm down
for 3:00 p.m. sharp.

24:44.645 --> 24:45.588
Yes.

24:45.657 --> 24:47.310
Yes.

24:47.378 --> 24:50.482
I'm sorry,
I'm not seeing anything.

24:50.550 --> 24:53.182
Darcy. Darcy!

24:53.251 --> 24:54.499
Mr. Stone?

24:54.567 --> 24:55.816
Please tell me
that you remembered

24:55.884 --> 24:57.232
to make this
appointment last month,

24:57.301 --> 24:59.756
because I only reminded
you about 5,000 times.

24:59.822 --> 25:00.886
KENSI:
Of course.

25:00.952 --> 25:02.599
Uh, I mean, I think so.

25:02.665 --> 25:04.474
Of course you did
or you think so?

25:04.540 --> 25:05.636
Which one is it?

25:05.702 --> 25:06.768
'Cause those are two
very different things.

25:06.834 --> 25:08.481
MARIBEL:
If you'd like, I may be able

25:08.546 --> 25:10.193
to set you up with
one of our senior advisors.

25:10.259 --> 25:12.002
Mm-hmm. What I'd like
is to have an assistant

25:12.068 --> 25:13.877
that isn't a complete
incompetent moron.

25:13.943 --> 25:15.589
What about
you, Maribel?

25:15.655 --> 25:17.269
You seem smart.
They pay you enough here?

25:17.335 --> 25:18.497
Well, I...

25:18.563 --> 25:20.185
I'm sure you can type
circles around this one.

25:20.254 --> 25:22.554
At least we know you can
put together an outfit.

25:22.622 --> 25:24.313
Which is much better
than-- Really?

25:24.382 --> 25:25.668
With the tears again?

25:25.735 --> 25:26.817
Every single day

25:26.886 --> 25:28.272
with the tears and the sobbing.

25:28.341 --> 25:30.201
I'll tell you what.
Here's the deal, missy.

25:30.269 --> 25:33.279
I'm gonna plant my wingtips
right here,

25:33.348 --> 25:35.750
and I'm not leaving
until Mr. Montalban

25:35.818 --> 25:37.104
walks through one
of those doors.

25:37.172 --> 25:40.893
Sir, I think it's time
for you to leave.

25:40.961 --> 25:43.566
We're just having a slightly
animated conversation.

25:43.635 --> 25:45.597
It's good for the blood.
No reason to, uh,

25:45.665 --> 25:46.612
become alarmed.

25:46.681 --> 25:47.864
(chuckles):
This guy.

25:47.932 --> 25:50.687
It's my job to
be alarmed, pal.

25:50.756 --> 25:54.484
Okay, my real pals
know not to touch me.

25:54.552 --> 25:56.365
That's mistake <i>numero uno.</i>

25:58.079 --> 25:59.556
Okay, come on, let's go.

25:59.625 --> 26:00.631
Oh, we're doing this?

26:00.700 --> 26:01.672
Mm-hmm.
You want to do it?

26:01.741 --> 26:02.816
Come on.
Right now?

26:02.883 --> 26:03.822
That's fine.

26:03.891 --> 26:04.830
We'll do it.

26:04.899 --> 26:06.107
(Kensi sobbing)

26:06.175 --> 26:07.215
Hands off, huh?

26:07.284 --> 26:08.425
I can walk myself.

26:08.493 --> 26:10.340
(in distance):
You guys validate parking?

26:11.920 --> 26:13.397
I'm so, so sorry.

26:13.464 --> 26:15.480
Don't even worry about it.

26:15.548 --> 26:17.866
It's just been
one of those months, you know.

26:17.934 --> 26:19.007
(sniffles)

26:19.076 --> 26:20.452
Oh, look at that,
I'm all blubbery.

26:20.521 --> 26:21.494
(chuckles)

26:21.563 --> 26:23.174
Do you have a bathroom
that I could use

26:23.242 --> 26:24.284
to freshen up a little bit?

26:24.351 --> 26:25.392
Sure.

26:25.461 --> 26:26.804
It's right down the hall.

26:26.871 --> 26:28.383
Thank you.

26:41.621 --> 26:42.629
(elevator bell dings)

26:58.149 --> 27:01.252
Plugging the phone in now.

27:01.319 --> 27:02.986
(phone beeps)

27:03.054 --> 27:04.555
NELL:
I've got the signal.

27:04.622 --> 27:07.757
And I'm in.

27:07.825 --> 27:10.526
Copying their database.

27:10.594 --> 27:11.828
Hide it well.

27:11.895 --> 27:14.029
The phone needs to be on
for at least a few hours

27:14.097 --> 27:15.030
to complete the transfer.

27:15.098 --> 27:17.533
Copy that.

27:25.808 --> 27:27.408
Put your rear
in gear, honey!

27:27.476 --> 27:28.775
That car ain't
driving itself!

27:28.843 --> 27:29.777
(snaps fingers)

27:29.845 --> 27:32.579
You need a new job.

27:32.646 --> 27:34.548
Yeah, tell me about it.

27:42.356 --> 27:46.494
Okay, I'm plugging in the IP
addresses Sam got from Bakri.

27:46.562 --> 27:47.963
Eric.

27:48.030 --> 27:49.803
I know, I know, we're
running out of time.

27:49.872 --> 27:51.987
Just because I make this look
easy, doesn't mean it is.

27:52.057 --> 27:53.215
Yeah, we know that.

27:53.285 --> 27:55.092
Just relax and take
your time, okay?

27:55.161 --> 27:58.299
Just not too much time.

27:58.369 --> 28:00.518
ERIC:
Okay, I think this will work.

28:00.587 --> 28:03.076
All right, I've pinged the IP
addresses you got from Bakri,

28:03.146 --> 28:05.159
basically, just
alerting them to...

28:05.227 --> 28:07.375
I think I got something.

28:07.444 --> 28:09.151
How do we confirm it's Khaled?

28:09.219 --> 28:10.959
I'm gonna try to a Trojan,

28:11.028 --> 28:13.314
could allow me to initiate
a video conference.

28:13.382 --> 28:14.849
Do it.

28:14.918 --> 28:18.226
Just promise me you won't
hurt me if it doesn't work.

28:18.296 --> 28:20.137
Have I ever hurt you, Eric?

28:20.206 --> 28:21.332
No.

28:21.401 --> 28:24.470
But there could always
be a first time.

28:27.100 --> 28:29.112
(beeping)

28:29.181 --> 28:31.216
I got something.

28:42.777 --> 28:44.286
(laughs)

28:44.354 --> 28:47.506
I can only applaud
your American ingenuity.

28:47.573 --> 28:52.004
And apparently Bakri's inability
to keep his mouth shut.

28:52.071 --> 28:53.779
Hm.

28:53.844 --> 28:55.223
Takes a special kind of coward

28:55.289 --> 28:57.784
to force somebody else to kill
their own sister, Khaled.

28:57.851 --> 29:01.069
This from a man who makes
lying his profession.

29:01.136 --> 29:02.710
I'm a liar;
you're a murderer.

29:02.777 --> 29:05.503
I think we're both familiar
with each other's professions.

29:05.569 --> 29:09.739
And yet you clearly
don't know me.

29:09.805 --> 29:14.239
I would never allow
anyone to harm my sister.

29:14.305 --> 29:16.176
No...

29:16.243 --> 29:19.034
when Jada dies, it
will be at my hand...

29:19.101 --> 29:22.613
as will you.

29:22.680 --> 29:24.355
Your friend
Adrien Montalban

29:24.421 --> 29:26.029
says different.

29:26.096 --> 29:28.264
Yes, every country wants
to be your friend,

29:28.332 --> 29:30.333
but when you
don't get what you want,

29:30.400 --> 29:33.435
you toss me to the wolves.

29:33.503 --> 29:36.672
Just like you have my sister.

29:36.740 --> 29:38.941
You did that
on your own, Khaled.

29:39.009 --> 29:42.945
I am not the one
who kidnapped her.

29:43.013 --> 29:44.279
We rescued her.

29:44.347 --> 29:46.615
I'm sure she
feels differently.

29:48.484 --> 29:51.753
Look at you with
all your technology,

29:51.821 --> 29:55.056
and yet...

29:55.124 --> 29:57.058
I am still free.

29:57.126 --> 30:00.429
I wouldn't get used to it.

30:02.465 --> 30:05.101
You have shamed my family.

30:05.169 --> 30:07.104
And there is a day coming

30:07.171 --> 30:10.174
when I will bring shame
to all of yours.

30:15.114 --> 30:16.482
(sighs)

30:16.550 --> 30:18.551
Eric?

30:18.618 --> 30:21.787
It's gonna take me a bit to
pinpoint his exact location.

30:21.855 --> 30:23.120
Keep trying.

30:23.189 --> 30:24.520
Come on.

30:26.388 --> 30:28.252
I'm getting a ton
of encrypted files

30:28.320 --> 30:29.786
off Montalban's servers,

30:29.853 --> 30:32.052
but it's gonna take me a while
to look through everything.

30:32.119 --> 30:34.784
Well, narrow your search for
the years Khaled was in office.

30:34.852 --> 30:36.117
Look for anything in Sudan.

30:36.184 --> 30:37.184
Got it.

30:39.050 --> 30:41.650
You're thinking Montalban's
in business with Khaled.

30:41.717 --> 30:43.815
I'm thinking he's a middle man
for the French government.

30:43.884 --> 30:46.383
The French have a long
history in that area.

30:46.451 --> 30:48.716
Could have been trying
to get a foothold in Sudan.

30:48.784 --> 30:50.782
And then they hear rumors
of his war crimes?

30:50.850 --> 30:52.382
Not exactly who they
were hoping for.

30:52.450 --> 30:54.282
So they "threw him
to the wolves."

30:54.350 --> 30:57.382
But they weren't expecting us
to get Jada out.

30:57.450 --> 31:00.191
If she testifies as
to what really went down,

31:00.260 --> 31:01.648
not only is Montalban
gonna take hit,

31:01.716 --> 31:03.070
but the French government

31:03.139 --> 31:04.797
is going to have some
serious explaining to do.

31:06.288 --> 31:07.641
Nice work at
Montalban's.

31:07.710 --> 31:08.963
BOTH:
Thanks.

31:09.031 --> 31:10.418
We're running out of time.
Which means

31:10.487 --> 31:11.976
Elmslie's family
is running out of time.

31:12.045 --> 31:14.482
If Elmslie was gonna kill Jada,
he would have already done it.

31:14.551 --> 31:16.582
He knows there's no way
they're gonna let his family go.

31:16.650 --> 31:18.105
The only leverage
he has left is Jada.

31:18.174 --> 31:20.341
And if he doesn't plan
on killing Jada?

31:20.409 --> 31:22.610
He's going to try to grab her
and force a trade.

31:22.679 --> 31:24.654
Jada said she still
wants to make

31:24.722 --> 31:25.727
a deposition this afternoon.

31:25.795 --> 31:27.200
She wants to get it over with.

31:27.269 --> 31:28.843
Which means they're gonna
move her again.

31:28.911 --> 31:30.149
You think Elmslie knows that?

31:30.217 --> 31:31.724
I think he's counting on it.

31:52.092 --> 31:53.666
(horn honking)

31:53.733 --> 31:53.799
Don't move!

31:56.045 --> 31:57.517
Hands on the dash.

31:57.587 --> 31:59.495
Hands on the wheel.

32:01.974 --> 32:03.682
What are you going
to do with that,

32:03.750 --> 32:05.056
smoke me to death?

32:18.539 --> 32:18.604
(door opens)

32:21.621 --> 32:22.926
You recognize any of these men?

32:28.288 --> 32:30.800
I have never seen this man.

32:32.474 --> 32:35.750
But these two had several
meetings with my brother.

32:35.817 --> 32:37.174
I believe they were
arms dealers.

32:37.241 --> 32:39.161
More or less.

32:39.228 --> 32:41.875
Thank you.

32:49.655 --> 32:51.971
DEEKS: How have they been
contacting you?

32:52.038 --> 32:55.845
I call them
from a burn phone, hang up,

32:55.912 --> 32:58.526
and then they call back
from another number.

32:58.594 --> 33:00.547
You're going to tell
them you have Jada,

33:00.614 --> 33:02.665
and you want to trade
for your family.

33:02.733 --> 33:04.355
That was your plan,
wasn't it?

33:04.422 --> 33:06.506
What if they don't go for it?

33:06.574 --> 33:08.096
KENSI:
They will.

33:08.162 --> 33:09.440
If they want Jada.

33:09.508 --> 33:10.651
They think they're dealing

33:10.719 --> 33:12.096
with one desperate operator.

33:12.165 --> 33:13.744
They won't be expecting us.

33:13.813 --> 33:15.056
(computer chirps)

33:15.125 --> 33:16.772
All right, guys,

33:16.839 --> 33:18.958
we've managed to decrypt
Adrien Montalban's files.

33:19.026 --> 33:21.346
Looks like he was filtering
weapons to Khaled

33:21.414 --> 33:23.801
from a rogue source
within the French military.

33:23.869 --> 33:26.794
And unfortunately, he did a
good job of covering his tracks.

33:26.862 --> 33:29.989
At best, you might be able
to tie Khaled to Montalban.

33:30.057 --> 33:31.737
But Jada's testimony
can change all that.

33:31.805 --> 33:35.437
She just I.D.'d two former DGSE
agents who met with her brother.

33:35.505 --> 33:38.700
Jada ties them to her brother,
we tie them to Montalban.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.439
And the walls
come tumbling down.

33:40.507 --> 33:42.346
<i>Exactement.</i>

33:42.414 --> 33:43.851
(click, chirp)

33:43.919 --> 33:45.256
SAM:
When they call back,

33:45.324 --> 33:46.627
you tell them you know

33:46.695 --> 33:48.968
Montalban was brokering weapons
from the French to Khaled.

33:49.036 --> 33:51.176
That should give us
the edge we need.

33:53.686 --> 33:55.692
(keypad beeping)

33:59.975 --> 34:01.981
(line ringing)

34:07.233 --> 34:10.244
Now we wait.

34:44.696 --> 34:46.034
No. No, no.

34:46.101 --> 34:47.205
Oh.

34:47.273 --> 34:49.478
Well, at least we
still have audio.

34:58.478 --> 34:59.581
(hissing, static)

34:59.649 --> 35:01.019
Wow.

35:01.087 --> 35:02.557
All right, I'm just
gonna ask it--

35:02.626 --> 35:04.531
the giant elephant
in the room question.

35:04.599 --> 35:07.476
You think anything ever happened
between those two?

35:08.714 --> 35:11.758
Sam's the most honorable man
I know.

35:15.806 --> 35:17.968
Jada...
No.

35:18.035 --> 35:21.738
You do not get to speak to me.

35:22.754 --> 35:24.818
You get to listen.

35:26.785 --> 35:28.913
You made me trust you, Sam.

35:28.980 --> 35:32.255
You made me turn my back
on the only family I had left.

35:32.322 --> 35:33.829
You made me kill for you.

35:37.762 --> 35:41.531
Life with my brother
was not perfect,

35:41.598 --> 35:43.663
but at least
I thought I had you.

35:44.679 --> 35:47.006
I believed
that I had you.

35:48.088 --> 35:51.397
And now I have nothing.

35:53.757 --> 35:56.541
I don't know what else I can say
other than I'm sorry.

35:58.050 --> 36:00.927
Sam, I do not want
your textbook apologies.

36:00.996 --> 36:03.331
What I want
I cannot have.

36:06.108 --> 36:07.834
You weren't part of the plan.

36:10.578 --> 36:12.608
You just happened.

36:13.727 --> 36:17.381
Why did you speak to me
on that first day?

36:19.109 --> 36:21.106
Why?

36:21.175 --> 36:23.137
Because you looked alone.

36:25.203 --> 36:27.336
They're calling back.

36:42.403 --> 36:44.671
(phone buzzing)

36:45.721 --> 36:47.075
(beep)

36:47.144 --> 36:49.174
MONTALBAN:
Is it done?

36:49.244 --> 36:50.935
No.

36:51.004 --> 36:52.403
Jada's still alive,

36:52.472 --> 36:54.072
but I have her.

36:54.140 --> 36:56.207
That was not what we discussed.

36:56.274 --> 36:58.410
But it's what we're
discussing now, Adrien.

36:58.477 --> 37:00.011
If you want the deals
that you brokered

37:00.079 --> 37:02.181
between Khaled
and the French kept secret,

37:02.248 --> 37:03.915
then I suggest
we arrange a trade.

37:03.983 --> 37:06.218
My family for Jada.

37:08.530 --> 37:10.197
We meet in one hour.

37:10.265 --> 37:11.866
I'll text you the location.

37:18.506 --> 37:20.974
We'll keep her safe.

37:52.407 --> 37:55.909
I don't especially like
being told what to do.

37:55.976 --> 37:58.845
I just want my family back.

37:58.913 --> 38:01.047
That all depends on you.

38:06.587 --> 38:10.623
(muffled groans, whimpers)

38:12.658 --> 38:14.959
This is how it's going to work:

38:15.027 --> 38:17.562
We take Jada with us.

38:17.631 --> 38:20.699
I leave one of my men here
with you and your family.

38:20.767 --> 38:23.336
Once we're safely away,

38:23.404 --> 38:26.406
I'll call my man, he'll leave.

38:26.473 --> 38:27.806
I'm not a fool.

38:27.874 --> 38:29.775
That's not what we discussed.

38:29.843 --> 38:32.845
But it's what
we're discussing now, Elmslie.

38:32.913 --> 38:35.382
Do you even have

38:35.449 --> 38:38.786
the slightest idea
of who you're dealing with?

38:39.787 --> 38:41.856
(shouting)

38:44.827 --> 38:46.227
(shouting)

38:53.636 --> 38:54.636
<i>Allez! Allez!</i>

39:04.046 --> 39:06.347
It's okay. It's okay.

39:18.660 --> 39:20.594
What? What is it?

39:20.662 --> 39:23.497
Montalban. He's gone.

39:23.564 --> 39:25.566
(sighs)

39:26.668 --> 39:28.670
(crying quietly)

39:31.907 --> 39:33.910
Everything that's happened...

39:36.352 --> 39:38.357
...everything
we've been through...

39:41.364 --> 39:43.435
...I had no choice.

39:47.045 --> 39:49.282
I am trying to understand.

39:53.092 --> 39:55.297
I wish I could.

40:06.395 --> 40:08.332
Oh, hey, what's
that for?

40:08.401 --> 40:11.373
All the ones I owe you,
plus a little more.

40:11.441 --> 40:13.179
Nell...

40:13.247 --> 40:14.648
Come on, it's just a game.

40:14.717 --> 40:16.051
It's not... not for real.

40:16.119 --> 40:17.756
Oh, I can take 'em back.

40:17.824 --> 40:18.926
No, no, no...

40:18.993 --> 40:20.563
Since you went through
all the trouble,

40:20.630 --> 40:22.668
just might as well
hang on to 'em.

40:22.737 --> 40:25.441
Yeah. Hey, Bubbly Cola.

40:25.509 --> 40:27.648
That's my favorite.
How did you know that?

40:27.715 --> 40:31.279
I may or may not have been doing
a little Facebook stalking.

40:32.380 --> 40:35.012
HETTY:
Excuse me.

40:35.079 --> 40:37.743
I think
I've been quite clear

40:37.812 --> 40:42.075
with my "no food or drink
in Ops" policy,

40:42.143 --> 40:43.475
don't you?

40:43.542 --> 40:45.473
Sorry.
Sorry.

40:45.541 --> 40:47.474
Ha!

40:47.541 --> 40:49.339
Jinx.

40:50.373 --> 40:52.570
Looks like I win.

40:52.638 --> 40:54.636
Wha...

40:59.134 --> 41:01.132
Good night.

41:11.227 --> 41:13.657
Eric found Khaled.

41:13.725 --> 41:15.723
He'll brief you.

41:15.791 --> 41:18.822
And Homeland Security
grabbed Montalban

41:18.890 --> 41:21.621
trying to board his
private jet to Morocco.

41:21.689 --> 41:23.471
No surprise there.

41:23.539 --> 41:26.433
Sooner or later,

41:26.501 --> 41:29.931
our sins seem to catch up to us.

41:31.816 --> 41:34.339
Good night, Mr. Callen.

41:46.721 --> 41:48.503
CALLEN:
You're the second one

41:48.571 --> 41:51.900
I found in here today
cleaning their weapons.

41:51.969 --> 41:54.255
Apparently, you and
Hetty have more in common

41:54.323 --> 41:56.341
than I thought.

41:59.909 --> 42:02.263
Eric found Khaled.

42:04.686 --> 42:06.463
He's in Spain.

42:07.589 --> 42:09.602
He's making his way here.

42:12.032 --> 42:12.860
(assembling gun)
