<i>Previously on</i>
Covert Affairs..

00:01.863 --> 00:03.183
Well,
I thought about your offer.

00:03.184 --> 00:04.968
I'm gonna take you up on it.
Outstanding.

00:05.052 --> 00:06.386
We haven't met.
I'm Caitlyn Cook.

00:06.437 --> 00:08.054
- Arthur Campbell.
- Oh, I know who you are.

00:08.105 --> 00:09.472
Everybody knows who you are.

00:09.557 --> 00:11.224
DNI's office
is putting together a team.

00:11.275 --> 00:13.193
They're coordinating it
out of the NCTC.

00:13.260 --> 00:14.945
Hayley Price, NCTC.

00:17.031 --> 00:20.116
Mykola Altan had
a surgically-implanted I.E.D.

00:20.201 --> 00:22.285
The surgery was done
by his sister, Oksana.

00:22.370 --> 00:25.605
Borz was seen boarding
a flight yesterday to Maracaibo.

00:25.656 --> 00:27.240
- Borz!
- We need him alive.

00:27.291 --> 00:29.292
Listen, I don't want to butt
heads with Langley over this.

00:29.377 --> 00:30.460
I really don't.

00:30.545 --> 00:31.611
So how about
we try and work together?

00:31.662 --> 00:33.112
I only want an hour alone
with Borz

00:33.164 --> 00:35.131
before I turn him over to you.
I got Borz.

00:35.350 --> 00:36.767
I'm gonna use McQuaid's team
to bring him home.

00:36.851 --> 00:39.436
The airstrip's five klicks
to the Colombian border.

00:39.521 --> 00:42.022
Pedro's supposed to have
the jet fueled and ready to go.

00:42.090 --> 00:43.423
Five hours
to the border, buddy.

00:43.475 --> 00:44.475
Enjoy the ride.

<i>No, gracias.</i>

01:06.664 --> 01:07.948
<i>No, gracias.</i>

01:07.999 --> 01:09.917
Me and the boys have had
some good times in Colombia.

01:09.968 --> 01:11.251
You ever been, Walker?

01:11.302 --> 01:13.170
We should've picked
a smaller border crossing.

01:13.254 --> 01:14.838
There's too many
unknown variables here.

01:14.923 --> 01:16.173
Busier the better.

01:16.257 --> 01:18.008
I haven't seen them look
in one trunk since we got here.

01:18.093 --> 01:19.493
They just want to clear
the traffic.

01:19.561 --> 01:21.595
This car cost four times
more than any other one here.

01:21.646 --> 01:23.263
They're gonna look in the trunk
just to see

01:23.314 --> 01:24.464
if there's anything
they can steal.

01:24.516 --> 01:26.150
A luxury automobile
sends a message--

01:26.234 --> 01:27.401
"I have money to bribe you."

01:27.468 --> 01:28.829
They're not gonna look
in the trunk

01:28.853 --> 01:30.771
once they see what's
in my wallet, right, boys?

01:30.822 --> 01:33.157
You've got the biggest wallet
I've ever seen, boss.

01:38.580 --> 01:40.614
Dex says the jet's fueled
and ready to go.

01:40.665 --> 01:42.366
We just have to get there.

01:44.919 --> 01:46.120
<i>No. No, gracias.</i>

01:47.655 --> 01:48.922
<i>No. No, gracias.</i>

01:48.990 --> 01:50.710
Just give him some money.
I'll take a water.

01:58.166 --> 01:59.833
Hey, hey!

01:59.884 --> 02:02.502
-<i> Policia!</i>
-<i> Policia!</i>

02:02.554 --> 02:04.504
-<i> Policia!</i>
- Come here!

02:12.180 --> 02:13.697
Get back in the car, Ryan.

02:13.782 --> 02:15.315
<i>Muerto!</i>

03:29.924 --> 03:32.609
We can't cross
the border now.

03:32.694 --> 03:34.361
We should head inland, quietly,

03:34.428 --> 03:36.428
'cause every cop in this country
is looking for us.

03:36.447 --> 03:37.447
We're splitting up.

03:37.532 --> 03:38.949
They'll be looking
for a foursome.

03:39.033 --> 03:40.767
We're better off in pairs.
Want us to take the principal?

03:40.818 --> 03:42.236
It might be easier
for us to carry him.

03:42.287 --> 03:44.204
Thanks,
but Borz doesn't leave my sight.

03:44.272 --> 03:45.772
We'll be fine.

03:45.823 --> 03:47.207
- We'll be fine.
- Okay.

03:47.275 --> 03:48.542
Okay, new plan.

03:48.609 --> 03:50.610
We got to take this car--
No, no, no, no, no.

03:50.662 --> 03:52.182
No, no, no.
We already tried your plan.

03:52.213 --> 03:53.413
I'm driving now.

03:53.464 --> 03:55.082
I think I can get us
a safe house in Caracas,

03:55.133 --> 03:57.467
and then we'll hole up
until the CIA can get us out.

03:57.552 --> 03:58.886
Wait in a barrio shithouse

03:58.953 --> 04:00.837
for Langley to shuffle
some paperwork to get us out?

04:00.922 --> 04:02.055
That's your plan?

04:02.123 --> 04:03.603
Knock him out with this
in four hours.

04:03.624 --> 04:04.925
- Thanks.
- Take care.

04:04.976 --> 04:06.343
That's my plan.

04:06.427 --> 04:09.629
Come with me or don't,
but I'm taking Borz with me.

04:09.681 --> 04:11.732
I have no problem
going to Caracas.

04:11.799 --> 04:13.267
But after what happened
in Chicago,

04:13.318 --> 04:16.103
I mean, we can't trust
that any CIA site is secure.

04:16.154 --> 04:17.771
Right now a place
that they don't control

04:17.822 --> 04:20.107
is a lot safer
than one that they do.

04:21.809 --> 04:22.809
Okay.

04:31.452 --> 04:32.753
Let's get a coffee.

04:35.256 --> 04:36.456
We're already late.

04:36.507 --> 04:38.125
Let them wait.

04:38.176 --> 04:40.294
This briefing is
a total waste of time.

04:40.345 --> 04:41.628
We could've done this
over the phone,

04:41.679 --> 04:43.719
but instead, they make us drive
all the way out here

04:43.798 --> 04:45.498
so they can rub our faces
in the border crossing.

04:45.550 --> 04:46.833
This isn't a reprimand.

04:46.884 --> 04:48.501
It's deconfliction protocol.

04:48.553 --> 04:49.603
They want us on the same page

04:49.670 --> 04:51.004
so we don't do one thing
for our guys

04:51.055 --> 04:52.672
while they do something else
for theirs.

04:52.724 --> 04:54.107
They're bigfooting us.

04:54.175 --> 04:56.176
Our plan went pear-shaped--
they're gonna cut us out,

04:56.227 --> 04:57.978
and they're gonna waste
an hour of time doing it.

04:58.029 --> 04:59.112
Forget the coffee.

04:59.180 --> 05:01.198
These things
never start on time.

05:01.282 --> 05:04.451
Just more evidence
of bureaucratic inefficiency.

05:04.518 --> 05:06.787
Clearly you've never worked
with my wife.

05:09.624 --> 05:12.359
Sorry we're late.

05:12.410 --> 05:14.494
Joan, this is Caitlyn Cook.

05:14.545 --> 05:17.914
- Nice to finally meet you.
- Likewise.

05:17.999 --> 05:19.499
Ryan's been in touch.

05:19.550 --> 05:21.468
What we know so far is,
he and Annie are headed

05:21.535 --> 05:23.170
to Caracas with Borz Altan

05:23.221 --> 05:25.472
and that they're keeping him
sedated while they travel.

05:25.539 --> 05:27.841
So the only question now is,
how do we get them out?

05:27.892 --> 05:29.509
We appreciate the risks
your people took

05:29.560 --> 05:32.262
in trying to extract
our operative from Venezuela,

05:32.347 --> 05:36.850
but moving forward, the CIA
will handle the exfiltration.

05:36.901 --> 05:39.319
Our plan is to extract them
by boat at night,

05:39.387 --> 05:40.937
using the cover of darkness
to sneak them in and out

05:41.022 --> 05:42.072
of Venezuelan waters.

05:42.156 --> 05:43.857
From there,
Altan will be delivered

05:43.908 --> 05:45.492
to a specialized
interrogation team

05:45.559 --> 05:47.361
for questioning
about the Chicago attack.

05:47.412 --> 05:49.363
Walker and McQuaid
will have to sit tight

05:49.414 --> 05:50.447
for a couple of hours,

05:50.531 --> 05:52.249
but we'll have them home
in no time.

05:52.333 --> 05:53.566
Have you considered
air extraction--

05:53.618 --> 05:55.002
getting them out now
instead of waiting?

05:55.069 --> 05:57.254
We have.
Too risky.

05:57.338 --> 05:59.172
Can we take a look
at the risk analysis?

05:59.240 --> 06:00.874
Maybe there's something
we can do on our end

06:00.925 --> 06:01.925
to mitigate the threat.

06:01.926 --> 06:03.243
I understand your urgency.

06:03.294 --> 06:04.577
Your boss' life is on the line.

06:04.629 --> 06:07.431
But I need to make one thing
perfectly clear.

06:07.515 --> 06:10.517
This is a CIA extraction.

06:10.584 --> 06:13.103
McQuaid Security
is not to do anything

06:13.187 --> 06:14.587
without my authorization.

06:14.639 --> 06:16.473
We'll liaise with you
if anything comes up.

06:16.557 --> 06:18.608
In the meantime, if there's
anything we can do to help,

06:18.693 --> 06:19.693
you just let us know.

06:19.694 --> 06:21.361
Actually, there is one thing.

06:21.429 --> 06:25.365
I understand your boss requested
time alone with Altan.

06:25.433 --> 06:27.434
Any idea what he'd want
to talk to him about?

06:27.485 --> 06:29.236
This is the first
I'm hearing of it.

06:29.287 --> 06:30.487
It's news to me too.

06:30.571 --> 06:32.906
I'll talk to him about it
when he gets back.

06:32.957 --> 06:34.207
Thank you.

07:02.303 --> 07:03.437
Not bad, huh?

07:03.488 --> 07:05.605
I had to pay a six-month lease
to get it.

07:05.656 --> 07:07.941
So, if you know anyone
who's looking to sublet, then...

07:07.992 --> 07:09.693
In another life,
I'd take it myself.

07:09.777 --> 07:10.944
Yeah.

07:10.995 --> 07:12.162
But is it safe?

07:12.246 --> 07:14.481
Safe?
In Caracas?

07:14.532 --> 07:16.199
I don't think the term applies.

07:19.487 --> 07:22.422
Ms. Walker, can I tempt you?

07:22.490 --> 07:25.092
It's a little early.

07:25.159 --> 07:27.494
Soldier sleeps when he can,
so to speak.

07:43.144 --> 07:45.028
Oh, it's smooth.

07:45.113 --> 07:47.013
Like 100 proof silk.

07:47.064 --> 07:49.316
Jim's family owns a distillery.

07:49.367 --> 07:51.234
Have you heard
from Jim and Fitz?

07:51.319 --> 07:52.452
Not yet.

07:52.520 --> 07:53.954
- You worried?
- Not at all.

07:54.021 --> 07:55.862
They're probably halfway
to Puerto Rico by now.

07:55.907 --> 07:57.908
It was pretty generous of you
to cut them loose.

07:57.992 --> 07:59.859
I take it you would've done
things differently.

07:59.911 --> 08:01.071
I can think
of a few scenarios

08:01.129 --> 08:02.963
where having a couple extra guys
might be useful.

08:03.030 --> 08:04.131
Really?

08:04.198 --> 08:05.698
You kind of strike me as someone

08:05.750 --> 08:08.468
who likes to do things
by yourself.

08:17.878 --> 08:19.813
That busted rib
must've punctured something.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.516
He's got internal bleeding.
His lung's collapsed.

08:22.567 --> 08:23.850
He needs a chest tube,

08:23.901 --> 08:25.652
or he's gonna die
and that intel goes with him.

08:25.719 --> 08:27.354
We can't let that happen.

There's a knife in the

08:41.150 --> 08:43.485
Okay, we need something
to sterilize all this.

08:53.245 --> 08:54.245
Yeah.

08:54.246 --> 08:56.731
Okay.

08:56.782 --> 08:58.199
Okay.

08:58.250 --> 08:59.868
Here we go.

09:02.088 --> 09:03.338
Okay.

09:03.405 --> 09:04.739
Jesus.

09:09.128 --> 09:11.346
Okay, this is the tricky part.
You got him?

09:11.413 --> 09:13.715
Yeah.
Do it. Do it.

09:36.455 --> 09:38.289
Nice work, Doc.

09:38.374 --> 09:39.491
Thanks.

09:39.575 --> 09:41.126
But all I did
was buy him a few hours.

09:41.210 --> 09:42.327
He needs surgery.

09:42.411 --> 09:43.795
You know a doctor
that makes house calls?

09:43.879 --> 09:45.330
Well, for the right price,
they'll fly to the moon,

09:45.414 --> 09:46.464
but this guy's not
a thoracic surgeon.

09:46.549 --> 09:47.632
Well, neither are we,

09:47.717 --> 09:49.784
so right now
our options are us or him.

09:49.835 --> 09:51.219
This guy
doesn't know protocol.

09:51.286 --> 09:53.287
The only way to make sure
that he isn't being followed

09:53.339 --> 09:56.624
is for me to go there
and bring him back here myself.

10:00.896 --> 10:03.014
Hey, you need anything
while I'm out--

10:03.099 --> 10:05.483
toothpaste or, I don't know,
bubble gum?

10:05.568 --> 10:07.485
Every badge in Venezuela
is looking for you.

10:07.570 --> 10:08.820
You're not fazed by that?

10:08.904 --> 10:10.939
Well, actually,
I'm scared shitless,

10:10.990 --> 10:13.241
but that's part
of the fun, right?

10:25.654 --> 10:27.989
Morning.

10:28.040 --> 10:29.758
Well, hey.
What are you doing here?

10:29.825 --> 10:31.826
Oh, I just--I had a few
follow-up interviews

10:31.877 --> 10:33.211
for the Chicago event.

10:33.295 --> 10:34.879
I'm glad we ran
into each other.

10:34.964 --> 10:36.264
Last night was fun.

10:36.331 --> 10:37.599
Yeah, it was.

10:38.884 --> 10:40.351
But I-I don't think
we should do it again.

10:40.436 --> 10:42.520
I don't want anybody
to get the impression

10:42.605 --> 10:44.856
that I'm not being objective.

10:44.940 --> 10:46.174
I completely understand.

10:46.225 --> 10:48.393
But I have to say,
I am a little disappointed.

10:48.477 --> 10:49.861
The sex was pretty great.

10:49.945 --> 10:53.114
I'll take a macchiato
with an extra shot.

10:53.182 --> 10:54.182
Excuse me?

10:54.233 --> 10:56.350
You disagree?

10:56.402 --> 10:58.570
No, no.
Um...

11:00.689 --> 11:01.956
It was kind of epic.

11:03.042 --> 11:05.126
So...

11:05.194 --> 11:06.194
So...

11:06.195 --> 11:07.629
See you around?

11:07.696 --> 11:10.298
Sure.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.555
Hi.

11:18.974 --> 11:20.141
Thank you.

11:28.651 --> 11:30.268
Hey, this is Auggie.

11:30.352 --> 11:32.320
- Hey, it's me.
- What's up?

11:32.387 --> 11:35.240
Borz is bleeding internally.

11:35.324 --> 11:37.525
McQuaid went to go get a doctor,
but we can't wait till dark

11:37.576 --> 11:38.827
to get out of this country.

11:38.894 --> 11:42.697
He needs to be medevacked
out of here A.S.A.P.

11:42.748 --> 11:44.115
Putting a chopper down
in daylight

11:44.200 --> 11:45.583
is gonna be next to impossible.

11:45.668 --> 11:46.951
How bad is he?

11:47.036 --> 11:50.171
McQuaid says
he has a few hours tops.

11:50.239 --> 11:51.756
I know this isn't
an ideal option,

11:51.841 --> 11:52.957
but is there a hospital nearby?

11:53.042 --> 11:54.363
You could drop him off
at the E.R.

11:54.376 --> 11:55.656
And scoop him up
in a couple days

11:55.678 --> 11:56.678
after he's had surgery.

11:56.745 --> 11:59.097
Auggie, this guy is skilled.

11:59.181 --> 12:00.581
As soon as he gets
out of surgery

12:00.633 --> 12:02.250
and becomes conscious,
he will disappear.

12:02.301 --> 12:04.302
I cannot take that chance.

12:04.386 --> 12:05.854
You do what you can
with the medevac,

12:05.921 --> 12:08.356
but I'm gonna start
the interrogation just in case.

12:08.423 --> 12:10.503
All right, I'll call you
the second I have something.

12:10.559 --> 12:12.593
Borz's condition sounds
too critical to risk moving him.

12:12.645 --> 12:14.946
I know some people in Colombia
that may be able to help.

12:15.030 --> 12:16.147
I'll make some calls.

12:16.232 --> 12:18.199
Patrick!

12:18.267 --> 12:20.702
- Sir.
- Clear my schedule for the day.

12:20.769 --> 12:22.237
This takes priority
over everything.

12:22.288 --> 12:23.771
Excuse me, sir,
but you're scheduled

12:23.822 --> 12:25.957
for a briefing with the Senate
Intelligence Committee.

12:26.041 --> 12:29.627
You're supposed to be there
in 30 minutes.

12:29.712 --> 12:32.130
All right.

12:32.214 --> 12:35.049
These are the names
of my people in Colombia.

12:35.117 --> 12:37.502
Get their information to Joan.

12:37.586 --> 12:38.803
Right away.

12:43.842 --> 12:47.228
Job's not like you thought
it would be, is it?

12:47.296 --> 12:48.646
It's all good.

12:56.772 --> 12:58.239
Who planned
the attack in Chicago,

12:58.307 --> 13:00.692
and how did you know
about the CIA facility?

13:07.316 --> 13:09.334
Those are big questions,
I know.

13:09.418 --> 13:10.818
We'll come back to them
in a minute.

13:10.819 --> 13:12.820
Let's talk about the man
you met up with in Maracaibo.

13:12.871 --> 13:15.673
What's his name?

13:18.043 --> 13:20.128
Keep your mouth shut, right?

13:20.179 --> 13:22.597
That's what they teach you
in the military.

13:22.664 --> 13:25.266
I know you have
anti-interrogation training,

13:25.334 --> 13:26.718
so I'm not gonna
waste your time

13:26.802 --> 13:28.770
trying to trick information
out of you.

13:28.837 --> 13:31.439
You're going
to torture me, then?

13:31.506 --> 13:33.107
I don't have
to torture you, Borz.

13:33.175 --> 13:35.893
You're in enough pain already.

13:35.978 --> 13:39.897
What I have to offer you
is relief.

13:54.330 --> 13:57.048
This is morphine.

13:59.701 --> 14:01.535
It's up to you
whether you get it or not.

14:09.878 --> 14:12.680
Was the CIA running
domestic operations

14:12.731 --> 14:15.600
out of the Chicago site?

14:15.684 --> 14:18.552
I cannot speak to the nature
of those operations.

14:18.604 --> 14:20.571
So you're unprepared
for this briefing.

14:20.656 --> 14:22.897
I have all the information
available to me at the moment.

14:22.908 --> 14:24.742
Let's talk about something
you do know--

14:24.827 --> 14:26.611
the CIA charter.

14:26.695 --> 14:29.580
You know that operating
on U.S. soil

14:29.665 --> 14:32.066
is a direct violation of it.

14:32.117 --> 14:34.335
With all due respect,
as I said a moment ago,

14:34.403 --> 14:37.071
I am not aware
of any CIA operation

14:37.122 --> 14:38.423
that violates it.

14:38.507 --> 14:40.741
Though the CIA may think
otherwise, Mr. Michaels,

14:40.793 --> 14:42.844
it is accountable
for what happened,

14:42.911 --> 14:45.046
and I demand answers.

14:45.097 --> 14:47.015
Are we keeping you
from something?

14:50.019 --> 14:52.887
Actually, you are.

14:52.938 --> 14:55.139
I beg your pardon?

14:55.224 --> 14:57.925
Events are still unfolding
in this situation,

14:57.976 --> 15:01.696
and I would be much better able
to better answer your questions

15:01.763 --> 15:03.431
if we adjourn
until tomorrow,

15:03.482 --> 15:06.367
and I could get back
to Langley and dig in.

15:06.435 --> 15:08.602
Surely, you have people
back at Langley

15:08.654 --> 15:09.937
dealing with things.

15:09.988 --> 15:11.122
Yes, I do, but--

15:11.206 --> 15:14.826
Then I see no need
to curtail this session.

15:14.910 --> 15:16.627
Since it's nearly noon,

15:16.712 --> 15:20.715
I move that we recess
for lunch.

15:20.782 --> 15:21.949
Very well.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.617
But I expect to see you
back here in one hour,

15:23.669 --> 15:24.669
Mr. Michaels.

15:24.670 --> 15:25.970
Yes.

15:26.055 --> 15:27.588
Yes, sir.

15:29.091 --> 15:31.092
Who financed the attack
in Chicago?

15:36.899 --> 15:40.801
Is all this pain
really worth protecting people

15:40.853 --> 15:42.487
who couldn't care less
about you?

15:42.571 --> 15:44.805
You don't know
what you're talking about.

15:44.857 --> 15:48.076
The man you met in Maracaibo
had a gun in his hand.

15:48.143 --> 15:50.311
He wasn't there to help you.

15:50.362 --> 15:51.812
He was there for one reason--

15:51.864 --> 15:55.917
to close the loop.

15:55.984 --> 15:59.203
The people you were working with
were ready to discard you

15:59.288 --> 16:01.789
as soon as you fulfilled
your purpose to them.

16:11.433 --> 16:13.551
Let's talk about Oksana.

16:13.635 --> 16:16.521
Oksana?

16:16.605 --> 16:17.939
What happened to her?

16:21.110 --> 16:22.510
What happened to her?

16:22.561 --> 16:23.778
We can't stay here.

16:23.845 --> 16:26.614
We have to go, now.

16:26.681 --> 16:27.815
What happened?

16:27.866 --> 16:29.534
The police are canvassing
the entire area.

16:29.618 --> 16:31.538
I heard one of them
asking a shopkeeper about us,

16:31.620 --> 16:32.703
so I came back here
to get you.

16:32.788 --> 16:34.021
It's only a matter of time

16:34.072 --> 16:35.873
before they start searching
this building too.

16:38.994 --> 16:41.412
<i>Policia!</i>

16:41.497 --> 16:43.714
You didn't happen to order
pizza, did you?

16:48.772 --> 16:49.948
They must have
followed you here.

16:50.027 --> 16:51.194
Nobody followed me.

16:51.278 --> 16:54.664
As I said, they're canvassing
the entire area.

16:54.748 --> 16:55.915
What are you doing?

16:55.983 --> 16:57.463
We're gonna have
to fight our way out.

16:57.501 --> 17:00.319
We can't fight our way out
and carry Borz at the same,

17:00.371 --> 17:01.654
and I am not leaving him here.

17:01.705 --> 17:03.123
He is my only link to Chicago.

17:03.174 --> 17:05.425
Okay, if you have a better
idea, I'd love to hear it.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.877
<i>Policia!</i>

17:12.499 --> 17:14.717
What are you doing?

17:21.474 --> 17:22.976
<i>Policia!</i>

17:27.147 --> 17:30.900
<i>Policia!</i>

17:30.985 --> 17:33.186
Sorry. I was just about
to get in the shower.

17:33.237 --> 17:35.121
- Is there anyone else here?
- Hey!

17:37.741 --> 17:39.859
No.

17:39.910 --> 17:41.194
What do you want?

17:41.245 --> 17:43.362
Let me see your I.D.

17:43.414 --> 17:44.747
Your I.D.

17:44.832 --> 17:47.083
It's in there.

17:47.168 --> 17:49.169
What's your purpose here
in Caracas?

17:49.220 --> 17:52.038
- I'm on vacation.
- Interesting.

17:52.089 --> 17:55.642
Not many people choose Caracas
as a place to come to relax.

18:14.612 --> 18:17.080
Look, I don't know
who you're looking for.

18:17.164 --> 18:19.065
But I have rights,
and I'm calling my embassy.

18:19.116 --> 18:21.067
Hey, what's that in your hand?
Let me see.

18:21.118 --> 18:22.368
- Nothing.
- What's that?

19:22.313 --> 19:26.232
- They're gone.
- Nice work.

19:26.300 --> 19:27.740
We should get him
in some dry clothes

19:27.768 --> 19:29.819
and get out of here.
I'll take care of that,

19:29.903 --> 19:33.306
but could I borrow your towel?

19:33.357 --> 19:36.642
Well, these ones
will work just fine.

19:40.364 --> 19:41.364
All right, Joan.

19:41.448 --> 19:43.082
Keep me posted.

20:10.177 --> 20:11.361
Hello?

20:11.445 --> 20:13.012
Hey.

20:13.063 --> 20:15.481
Hey, baby.

20:15.532 --> 20:18.618
Listen, um,
I can't talk right now.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.703
And why not?

20:20.788 --> 20:23.689
You know why.

20:23.741 --> 20:25.408
Yeah, well,
I got to get back anyway.

20:25.492 --> 20:28.661
Lunch break's almost over.

20:28.712 --> 20:31.381
I want to see you tonight.

20:31.465 --> 20:34.700
I think
I can make that happen.

20:34.752 --> 20:36.502
You think, or you know?

20:36.553 --> 20:37.804
8:30.

20:37.871 --> 20:40.640
Don't be late,
or I'll start without you.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.425
How about
I come over there right now?

20:42.509 --> 20:45.511
Stop.

20:45.562 --> 20:47.563
Hey, wait.

20:51.985 --> 20:52.985
How is he?

20:52.986 --> 20:54.404
He's dressed.

20:54.488 --> 20:55.605
We should get out of here--

20:55.689 --> 20:57.023
- I need you to wait out here.
- You do?

20:57.074 --> 20:58.875
Yeah, unless you're gonna
tell me what you got

20:58.909 --> 21:01.194
during your hour with him,
this is my time.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.534
You asked about Oksana.

21:12.673 --> 21:14.924
She's alive.

21:15.008 --> 21:17.543
You left her behind in Chicago,
and we got her.

21:20.180 --> 21:22.765
She's not in a good place.

21:22.850 --> 21:25.584
You can imagine
what they're doing to her.

21:28.355 --> 21:30.606
You left her,
and now people are hurting her

21:30.691 --> 21:33.192
for information you have.

21:33.260 --> 21:36.429
Tell me what I need to know,
and I will help Oksana.

21:40.367 --> 21:43.319
Who planned the attack
in Chicago?

21:43.404 --> 21:45.121
I don't know.

21:46.773 --> 21:49.442
Everything was so careful.

21:49.493 --> 21:54.163
No one was supposed to know
anyone else.

21:54.248 --> 21:55.882
They planned it this way.

21:55.949 --> 21:58.451
They who?

21:58.502 --> 22:00.753
I need a name, Borz.

22:02.840 --> 22:05.624
What was the name
of your contact in Maracaibo?

22:05.676 --> 22:07.894
I never knew his name.

22:10.647 --> 22:13.433
I know you know something.

22:13.484 --> 22:16.102
Tell me.

22:16.153 --> 22:18.604
Tell me for Oksana.

22:24.445 --> 22:26.996
I went to Washington once

22:27.080 --> 22:30.666
for intel about CIA protocol.

22:30.751 --> 22:32.651
When?

22:32.703 --> 22:34.871
It was...

22:34.955 --> 22:36.672
Spring.

22:36.757 --> 22:38.841
There was snow on the ground.

22:38.926 --> 22:40.843
Where in Washington?

22:44.097 --> 22:46.999
You won't find
security footage...

22:47.050 --> 22:48.935
of us.

22:49.002 --> 22:51.270
We were very careful.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.341
"We"?

22:55.392 --> 22:57.610
It was a meet,
not a dead drop?

22:57.677 --> 22:59.845
Yes.

22:59.897 --> 23:01.481
I need a name.

23:03.700 --> 23:07.787
I only knew him
as the Postman.

23:09.740 --> 23:12.208
That's not good enough.

23:12.292 --> 23:13.960
It's all I have.

23:16.914 --> 23:18.531
How did he know
about the facility?

23:18.582 --> 23:20.383
Was he CIA?

23:20.467 --> 23:21.467
NSA?

23:21.468 --> 23:23.386
I don't know.
I don't--

23:23.470 --> 23:26.639
I can't help Oksana
if I can't identify him.

23:29.843 --> 23:32.728
I swear to you...

23:32.813 --> 23:34.063
It's all I know.

23:37.884 --> 23:40.353
On Oksana.

23:44.241 --> 23:46.158
What did he look like?

23:46.226 --> 23:47.577
Was he American?

23:54.568 --> 23:56.002
Borz?

24:16.272 --> 24:18.194
Nothing in our files
on Postman.

24:18.721 --> 24:20.201
Sorry, Auggie.
That's all I could get.

24:20.206 --> 24:21.490
Hey,
in the short time you had,

24:21.541 --> 24:23.142
it's great you got anything
at all.

24:23.209 --> 24:25.978
How'd you do it?

24:26.045 --> 24:28.213
Would you believe
all I had to say was "please"?

24:28.265 --> 24:29.765
Completely.

24:29.850 --> 24:32.101
I've seen how you say "please."

24:32.185 --> 24:34.687
I should go.

24:36.072 --> 24:37.712
We're gonna find another place
to lay low,

24:37.741 --> 24:40.192
but the sooner you can get us
out of this country, the better.

24:42.863 --> 24:44.747
Yeah, as quick as we can.
All right.

24:44.831 --> 24:47.917
I got to go.

24:50.453 --> 24:52.705
That was quick.

24:52.756 --> 24:55.457
He's dead.

24:55.542 --> 24:58.677
Did you get
what you wanted?

24:58.745 --> 24:59.795
We're leaving.

24:59.880 --> 25:01.297
Get your stuff.

25:01.381 --> 25:03.048
We got to find a new car.

25:05.969 --> 25:07.419
With Borz out of the picture,

25:07.470 --> 25:09.104
at least the extraction
will be easier.

25:09.189 --> 25:11.023
Have you got any word
on a new plan?

25:11.090 --> 25:12.942
We're taking a look
at all the options as we speak.

25:13.026 --> 25:14.727
I'll let you know
as soon as we have something.

25:14.778 --> 25:15.978
May I offer a suggestion?

25:18.231 --> 25:19.481
I'm all ears.

25:19.566 --> 25:20.966
Get them back
to the border crossing

25:21.034 --> 25:22.368
and fly them out of Colombia.

25:22.435 --> 25:24.395
Well, you're gonna have
to explain that one to me,

25:24.437 --> 25:25.837
because I seem to remember
that plan

25:25.872 --> 25:27.907
not working so well last time,
and by "not well,"

25:27.958 --> 25:30.542
I mean
it was a colossal shit show.

25:30.610 --> 25:32.244
They're not smuggling
a body in the trunk anymore.

25:32.295 --> 25:34.055
All we're talking
about is getting two people

25:34.113 --> 25:35.113
past border control.

25:35.114 --> 25:36.832
I have a guy
who can do that.

25:36.917 --> 25:38.751
It's an interesting idea,
but your entire plan

25:38.802 --> 25:40.920
hinges upon entrusting
my operative's life

25:40.971 --> 25:42.137
to a man I don't know.

25:42.222 --> 25:43.789
Well, know this.

25:43.840 --> 25:46.926
I'm extremely loyal to my boss
and would never do anything

25:46.977 --> 25:50.262
to put him in jeopardy.

25:50.313 --> 25:51.847
How soon
can your man be ready?

25:51.932 --> 25:53.182
20 minutes.

25:53.266 --> 25:55.186
All it takes is a phone call
and a wire transfer.

25:57.354 --> 25:58.804
Do it.

25:58.855 --> 26:00.906
Auggie,
we're moving on an exfil.

26:00.974 --> 26:02.274
How?

26:02.325 --> 26:04.660
I can't get a Black Hawk
down there for love or money.

26:04.744 --> 26:06.278
McQuaid Security
has another plan,

26:06.329 --> 26:07.780
so I'm letting them run
with it.

26:07.831 --> 26:09.665
You should get back
to work on the Postman.

26:09.749 --> 26:12.001
Hey, about him, we've got
nothing in our database,

26:12.085 --> 26:14.036
but I know a guy off campus
who might be able to help.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.505
His name's Roger Bennett.
He's former CIA.

26:16.589 --> 26:17.756
"Former"?
Not retired?

26:17.824 --> 26:20.376
He had a late-onset
chemical imbalance,

26:20.460 --> 26:22.100
but he's a good guy,
and more importantly,

26:22.128 --> 26:23.996
he's an expert
in black-market intelligence.

26:24.047 --> 26:25.998
Better go talk to him, then.

26:26.049 --> 26:28.434
I think we need
a different neighborhood

26:28.501 --> 26:29.718
to steal a car.

26:29.803 --> 26:31.720
These cars are too flashy,
and riding in style

26:31.805 --> 26:33.485
didn't exactly work in our favor
last time.

26:33.506 --> 26:35.024
We need something reliable.

26:35.108 --> 26:37.226
Who knows what condition these
old beaters are gonna be in?

26:37.310 --> 26:38.527
And the last thing
that we need

26:38.611 --> 26:39.945
is to be stranded
out in the open.

26:40.013 --> 26:42.865
Also, I am allergic to cheap.

26:42.949 --> 26:45.484
Tomas,<i>vamos.</i>

26:45.535 --> 26:48.737
Tomas,<i> Ven conmigo.</i>

26:48.822 --> 26:50.406
All good?

26:50.490 --> 26:52.708
Yeah.

26:52.792 --> 26:55.544
I forgot that I ditched
my gun in Maracaibo.

26:55.628 --> 26:58.414
I didn't used
to carry one, but...

26:58.498 --> 27:00.532
You know, it doesn't matter.

27:00.583 --> 27:02.534
I get it.
It's not a good feeling.

27:02.585 --> 27:03.752
You feel naked without it.

27:03.837 --> 27:05.357
But you don't have
to worry about that,

27:05.371 --> 27:08.807
because I am fast enough
for the both of us.

27:08.875 --> 27:10.709
Great.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.094
I feel a lot better.

27:17.684 --> 27:19.485
Now, that's what
I'm talking about.

27:25.358 --> 27:27.078
Whoa. What are you doing?
Stealing us a car.

27:27.110 --> 27:28.671
Oh, I'm sorry,
but I'm not gonna let you

27:28.728 --> 27:30.112
mar this fine vehicle.

27:30.196 --> 27:32.731
- Okay, how do you suggest we--
- Electronic skeleton key.

27:32.782 --> 27:35.567
It decodes almost any car lock,

27:35.618 --> 27:38.287
and it's standard issue
to all McQuaid field Ops.

27:38.371 --> 27:41.173
You know, this would look great
on your key ring.

27:41.240 --> 27:42.591
The answer's still no.

27:42.675 --> 27:45.594
You're only
cheating yourself.

27:55.438 --> 27:56.638
Auggie.

27:56.723 --> 27:58.357
Who sent you?

27:58.424 --> 27:59.525
Uh, nobody sent me, Roger.

27:59.592 --> 28:00.776
I need a favor.

28:00.860 --> 28:03.562
I tried calling,
but your phone's disconnected.

28:03.613 --> 28:04.947
Don't use phones
much these days.

28:06.032 --> 28:08.100
Can I come in?

28:14.824 --> 28:16.458
Did anyone see you come here?

28:16.543 --> 28:17.960
Were you followed?

28:18.044 --> 28:20.612
I really
couldn't tell you, buddy.

28:20.663 --> 28:22.664
Right.

28:22.749 --> 28:23.782
Okay.

28:26.836 --> 28:27.953
Come in.

28:28.004 --> 28:30.222
Hey, uh,
your dog sounds territorial.

28:30.289 --> 28:31.974
You want to put it somewhere?

28:40.850 --> 28:43.185
What's that sound?
Frequency jammer.

28:46.940 --> 28:48.857
It's protection against
cell phones and walkies.

28:48.942 --> 28:50.325
They won't work
in or around this place.

28:50.410 --> 28:52.144
What's going on?
Why all the precautions?

28:52.195 --> 28:54.997
Someone started
following me a while ago.

28:55.081 --> 28:57.199
I think
they're trying to kill me.

28:57.283 --> 28:59.317
- Who?
- I've said too much already.

28:59.369 --> 29:01.670
They listen.

29:01.754 --> 29:05.841
They follow, and they listen,

29:05.925 --> 29:07.259
and then they kill.

29:13.933 --> 29:16.351
So what's this favor?

29:16.436 --> 29:18.270
Hey, don't worry
about it, buddy.

29:18.337 --> 29:20.105
Sounds like your plate's
pretty full already.

29:20.173 --> 29:23.008
What, are you kidding me?
All I got is time.

29:23.059 --> 29:24.943
Lay it on me.

29:26.512 --> 29:28.647
Okay.

29:28.698 --> 29:30.399
You ever hear
of someone selling intel

29:30.483 --> 29:31.984
by the name Postman?

29:32.035 --> 29:33.285
Postman?

29:33.352 --> 29:36.354
Yeah, I know.
It's all I got.

29:36.406 --> 29:37.739
Doesn't ring any bells.

29:37.824 --> 29:40.325
You think you might be able
to find out who it is?

29:40.376 --> 29:41.860
I can sure as hell try.

29:41.911 --> 29:43.078
Thanks, Roger.

29:43.163 --> 29:45.581
Send me whatever you got
the moment you get it.

29:45.665 --> 29:47.032
I'll give you
my email address.

29:47.083 --> 29:49.251
I don't have
a computer anymore.

29:49.335 --> 29:51.503
It's not safe.

29:51.554 --> 29:53.305
Here...

29:55.208 --> 29:57.259
Ah.

29:57.343 --> 29:59.511
I'll call you on this phone
when I find something.

29:59.562 --> 30:00.923
I tweaked it to work
on frequencies

30:00.980 --> 30:04.983
beyond a scanner's range--
no GPS either.

30:05.051 --> 30:06.935
Okay, thanks.

30:08.988 --> 30:11.573
You should go now.

30:11.658 --> 30:13.325
Okay.

30:17.780 --> 30:19.364
Hey, Roger.

30:19.415 --> 30:22.000
Take care of yourself.

30:43.589 --> 30:45.224
Is this really the time
for a pit stop?

30:48.594 --> 30:49.778
This is our ride.

30:56.653 --> 30:58.613
- Taking a chiva to Colombia?
- What's the matter?

30:58.621 --> 30:59.988
I thought
you were into non-flashy.

31:00.073 --> 31:01.593
This is about
as non-flashy as it gets.

31:01.607 --> 31:04.243
No, I'm fine.
I'm just surprised.

31:04.294 --> 31:05.777
I didn't know open-air windows

31:05.828 --> 31:07.713
satisfied your
air-conditioning requirement.

31:07.780 --> 31:09.881
The only requirement that
I have is to get the job done.

31:09.949 --> 31:11.800
If I have to sweat my ass off
on an overcrowded bus,

31:11.884 --> 31:12.884
so be it.

31:14.003 --> 31:15.721
I can live
with being hot and sweaty,

31:15.788 --> 31:17.389
as long as I keep living,
you know?

31:17.456 --> 31:18.974
Yeah.

31:42.547 --> 31:43.788
You're awfully quiet.

31:44.101 --> 31:46.019
I'm just trying
to stay alert.

31:46.070 --> 31:48.054
No, you're not.

31:48.105 --> 31:49.772
You're thinking,
"can I trust this guy?

31:49.857 --> 31:51.991
"Who is he really?
Is he a war profiteer?

31:52.059 --> 31:53.726
Is he a mercenary?"

31:53.777 --> 31:57.664
Believe it or not,
I'm a patriot, just like you.

31:59.416 --> 32:01.200
I like this little trick
you're doing,

32:01.252 --> 32:03.202
trying to open up
to get me to open up.

32:03.254 --> 32:05.421
Okay, you figured me out.

32:05.506 --> 32:06.623
Cards up.

32:06.707 --> 32:09.075
What did you say to Borz
to get him to talk?

32:09.126 --> 32:10.426
I never said he did.

32:10.511 --> 32:11.844
You didn't say
he didn't either.

32:11.912 --> 32:13.880
What did you say to Borz
to get him to talk?

32:13.931 --> 32:15.492
I just told him
it wasn't gonna hurt him

32:15.516 --> 32:17.550
to give me what I wanted.

32:20.253 --> 32:21.437
We're here.

32:24.975 --> 32:26.025
Is this our guy?

32:26.093 --> 32:27.527
Our guy was supposed
to wave the bus

32:27.594 --> 32:28.594
through the crossing.

32:33.484 --> 32:34.651
<i>Identificacion.</i>

32:38.706 --> 32:40.073
I just got a text
from Annie.

32:40.124 --> 32:41.491
They've been stopped
at the border,

32:41.575 --> 32:42.659
and your man hasn't shown yet.

32:42.743 --> 32:44.794
Where the hell is he?
I don't know.

32:44.878 --> 32:45.995
He should be there.

32:48.582 --> 32:49.782
This your bag?

32:49.833 --> 32:51.918
Uh,<i>si.</i>

33:01.345 --> 33:03.295
Follow me, please.

33:20.581 --> 33:23.449
Can you at least tell us
what's the matter?

33:23.500 --> 33:26.252
We won that money
at the Plaza Casino last night.

33:26.319 --> 33:28.788
We got lucky at the Blackjack.

33:43.637 --> 33:45.304
Okay?

33:49.893 --> 33:52.395
Quickly,
before he comes back out.

33:52.479 --> 33:54.564
I'm so sorry I wasn't there
when your bus arrived.

33:54.648 --> 33:55.782
My captain called me inside

33:55.849 --> 33:57.410
to check the logs
from the shift change.

33:57.484 --> 33:59.045
You'll explain this
to miss Cook, right?

33:59.069 --> 34:00.653
I'm sure she'll understand.

34:05.042 --> 34:06.325
Here we are.

34:06.377 --> 34:08.578
Stay down until
you're well past the border.

34:08.661 --> 34:10.663
<i>Vayan con dios,</i> my friends.

34:33.219 --> 34:35.021
Annie and Ryan
made it to Colombia.

34:35.072 --> 34:36.688
That's fantastic news.

34:36.739 --> 34:38.858
Care to join me?
I hate to drink alone.

34:38.909 --> 34:41.027
I could really use one.
Yeah, maybe a small one.

34:41.078 --> 34:42.728
I have to get home soon.

34:42.780 --> 34:44.420
I've been meaning
to say something to you.

34:44.447 --> 34:45.563
Shoot.

34:45.616 --> 34:46.949
This business
with Ryan and Borz,

34:47.034 --> 34:48.918
if you know what
he wanted from him,

34:49.002 --> 34:50.402
I need to know too.

34:50.454 --> 34:52.588
I would've told you
if I knew by now, Arthur.

34:52.672 --> 34:54.090
We don't stovepipe
our intel here,

34:54.174 --> 34:55.373
not amongst ourselves.

34:55.426 --> 34:57.510
Glad to hear it.

34:57.577 --> 34:58.878
Good.

35:02.582 --> 35:03.800
Ahh.

35:07.938 --> 35:10.338
Life in the private sector's
gonna take some getting used to.

35:10.357 --> 35:13.142
You need someone to talk to,
I'm here.

35:25.605 --> 35:27.623
I'm sorry.

35:27.708 --> 35:29.876
No problem.

35:29.943 --> 35:33.129
We should do this again
sometime, without all the guns.

35:33.213 --> 35:34.997
Uh, I don't mix
business and pleasure.

35:35.082 --> 35:37.967
Well, then you lose
on both counts, Annie Walker.

35:38.051 --> 35:39.412
Oh, by the way,
I haven't forgotten

35:39.452 --> 35:40.972
that conversation
we were having before

35:41.054 --> 35:44.307
about how you cracked Borz.

35:44.391 --> 35:46.392
Cards up, remember?

35:46.459 --> 35:51.013
- Why do you want to know?
- Why don't you want to tell me?

35:51.098 --> 35:53.015
Okay, forget it.

35:53.100 --> 35:55.485
I'm gonna get some sleep.

36:01.825 --> 36:05.361
I told him we had his sister
in custody

36:05.445 --> 36:08.331
and that it was his fault
because he left her behind,

36:08.415 --> 36:10.833
and if he told me
what I needed to know,

36:10.918 --> 36:12.919
I would help her.

36:12.986 --> 36:15.487
Can you?

36:15.539 --> 36:16.706
I shot her in Chicago.

36:16.790 --> 36:19.258
She died four days ago.

36:19.326 --> 36:21.928
Cards up.

36:21.995 --> 36:23.546
So you lied to a dying man.

36:23.630 --> 36:26.516
That's a pretty dark move,
Walker.

36:26.600 --> 36:27.967
I did what needed
to be done.

36:28.018 --> 36:29.668
That wasn't a criticism.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.804
That was a compliment.

36:40.633 --> 36:41.633
Hey.

36:51.461 --> 36:52.461
Hello?

36:52.545 --> 36:54.463
That guy
you're interested in?

36:54.547 --> 36:58.017
I put some lines in the water,
and I, uh, got a bite.

36:58.084 --> 36:59.685
I should have something
tomorrow morning

36:59.752 --> 37:00.752
if you want to come by.

37:00.753 --> 37:01.920
That is outstanding news.

37:01.972 --> 37:03.138
I'll be there at 8:00.

37:03.223 --> 37:04.473
9:00's better.

37:04.557 --> 37:06.475
Uh, bring doughnuts.

37:06.559 --> 37:07.893
Done.

37:07.944 --> 37:09.395
I'll see you then.

37:23.960 --> 37:25.494
Something on your mind?

37:28.948 --> 37:30.416
Just work.

37:30.467 --> 37:32.384
Is everything okay?

37:32.452 --> 37:36.455
See, I was good
at my old job.

37:36.506 --> 37:39.291
So good, I got a promotion.

37:39.342 --> 37:41.510
That's good news, isn't it?

37:41.594 --> 37:43.762
That's what I thought,

37:43.813 --> 37:46.798
but now...

37:46.850 --> 37:48.633
I don't get to do
the parts of my job

37:48.685 --> 37:51.937
that I really enjoy.

37:51.988 --> 37:55.441
And I...

37:55.492 --> 37:59.111
Used to think I was, uh...

37:59.162 --> 38:01.313
I used to think
I was accomplishing,

38:01.364 --> 38:05.084
you know, something,
that I was...

38:06.819 --> 38:10.589
The work I was doing
was really important.

38:10.656 --> 38:12.791
But now...

38:12.842 --> 38:17.096
It feels like all I do...

38:17.163 --> 38:21.266
is go to meetings
and write paperwork.

38:21.334 --> 38:24.303
The only NFL team
to win the Super Bowl

38:24.354 --> 38:26.605
after a perfect season
was the '72--

38:26.672 --> 38:28.223
'72 Dolphins.

38:28.308 --> 38:32.127
Don Shula was just
as important to that record

38:32.178 --> 38:33.979
as the players on the field.

39:06.596 --> 39:07.930
Thank you.

39:14.020 --> 39:17.072
You're welcome.

39:17.157 --> 39:19.858
I've still got some time.

39:19.909 --> 39:22.361
You could stay a little longer
if you like.

39:24.080 --> 39:26.999
You know what?
I'd love to, but I got to--

39:27.066 --> 39:28.500
I got to get going.

39:34.457 --> 39:36.175
Yeah.

39:56.929 --> 39:59.782
Hello?

39:59.866 --> 40:01.033
Hi.
Hey.

40:01.100 --> 40:02.484
Sorry to stop by like this.

40:02.569 --> 40:04.620
I just--I'm missing
one more signature

40:04.704 --> 40:06.071
for your statement.

40:06.122 --> 40:07.939
You're on my way home.

40:07.991 --> 40:10.075
Come in.

40:10.126 --> 40:13.295
I wasn't planning on going
back to Langley this week.

40:17.217 --> 40:18.967
- Sorry.
- Oops.

40:21.287 --> 40:24.339
Okay.

40:24.424 --> 40:26.592
I have it right here.

40:26.643 --> 40:27.893
And a pen.

40:27.960 --> 40:29.144
Bottom right corner?

40:29.229 --> 40:32.264
No, actually on this one,
it's the left.

40:32.315 --> 40:33.315
Right there, yeah.

40:33.316 --> 40:35.150
- Right here?
- Mm-hmm.

40:51.918 --> 40:53.085
You didn't just come
down here

40:53.152 --> 40:56.004
to have me sign something,
did you?

41:18.841 --> 41:24.841
