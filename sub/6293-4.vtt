UNITED STATES OF TARA...

00:12.380 --> 00:13.814
I'M KINDA WORRIED
ABOUT MAX, THOUGH.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.384
THE ALTERS HAVE BEEN
COMING ON TO HIM.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.352
I'VE BEEN READING A TASTEFUL
GUIDE TO THE FRENCH ARTS.

00:18.386 --> 00:19.820
HE SAYS HE RESPECTS
OUR AGREEMENT

00:19.853 --> 00:21.522
AND DOESN'T SLEEP WITH THEM,

00:21.555 --> 00:23.157
BUT I DON'T KNOW...
I THINK HE'S TEMPTED.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.359
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG
SINCE WE DID ANY MANLY STUFF.

00:25.393 --> 00:28.296
ALL WE DO NOW
IS NURSE TREES AND SHIT.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.231
WE'RE LANDSCAPERS,
ASSHOLE.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.166
ARE YOU HIRING?

00:32.200 --> 00:33.701
I'D LIKE TO FILL OUT
AN APPLICATION.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.836
I THINK HE'S NICE.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.372
I'M WORKIN' ON THIS EXPERIMENTAL
THEATER THING RIGHT NOW.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.074
YOU SHOULD COME
CHECK IT OUT.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.475
HELL HOUSE?
IS THAT THE NAME OF THE PLAY?

00:41.509 --> 00:43.777
HI! TIFFANY ST. JOHN.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.313
THIS PART OVER HERE,

00:45.346 --> 00:47.148
WOULD HAVE KIND OF
A TROMP L'OEIL-TYPE FEEL.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.416
I AM IMPRESSED.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.751
I KNOW ABOUT
THE MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.520
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE CONQUERED IT
WITH YOUR CREATIVITY

00:52.553 --> 00:53.854
AND YOUR TALENT.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.257
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?
TRYING TO GET LAID.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.192
I GOTTA GET
THESE CONCEPTS MOCKED UP.

00:58.226 --> 00:59.860
CHARMAINE ACTUALLY DID ME
A FAVOR FOR ONCE.

00:59.893 --> 01:02.530
IT'S A MURAL, TOO,
NOT SOME BORING BATHROOM JOB.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.432
HEY.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.600

01:26.887 --> 01:31.492
* IT'S WINDY,
AND OUR FAMILY NEEDS A RIDE *

01:31.525 --> 01:33.694
*

01:33.727 --> 01:38.499
* I KNOW WE'LL BE JUST FINE

01:38.532 --> 01:42.303

02:08.829 --> 02:10.331
[soft ping]

02:10.364 --> 02:12.500
I DON'T BELIEVE IN GOD.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.735
I WISH I DID.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.470
[more feminine voice]
HAIL MARY, FULL OF GRACE,

02:16.504 --> 02:18.206

02:20.308 --> 02:21.842
BLESSED ART THOU
AMONGST WOMEN,

02:21.875 --> 02:24.845
AND BLESSED IS THE FRUIT

02:24.878 --> 02:27.881
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I BELIEVE IN.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.453
YES, I DO.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.255
FAITH...

02:34.288 --> 02:35.856
AND ART--

02:35.889 --> 02:39.159
NOT THAT WHAT I DO
IS ART OR ANYTHING.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.832
THIS ONE HERE

02:52.573 --> 02:55.743
GIGANTIC FUNDRAISING
THERMOMETERS.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.458
BUT ONCE IN A WHILE...

03:10.491 --> 03:12.526
WHAT YOU DO FOR WORK

03:12.560 --> 03:15.463
IS ALSO
WHAT YOU DO FOR LOVE.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.002
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS...

03:22.035 --> 03:24.505
[chuckles]
IT'S HEAVEN.

03:24.538 --> 03:28.342

HAVING YOUR GENTLEMAN'S TIME--

04:02.576 --> 04:04.778
WHICH IS FINE.
I THINK IT'S FANTASTIC.

[giggles]

04:06.980 --> 04:08.782
WHAT?

04:08.816 --> 04:10.318
WHERE'D YOU GET
THE TERM "GENTLEMAN'S TIME"?

04:10.351 --> 04:11.719
I MADE IT UP.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.421
RIGHT NOW? JUST NOW?

04:13.454 --> 04:15.423
WELL, YEAH.
I DIDN'T KNOW, SO...

04:15.456 --> 04:16.957
NO, NO, IT'S GOOD.
I LIKE IT.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.959

INTERESTING QUESTION

04:33.607 --> 04:35.609
YOU POSE, LITTLE LADY.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.578
SOME DAY WHEN WOMEN
HAVE THE VOTE,

04:37.611 --> 04:39.913
WE'LL HAVE TO DISCUSS IT.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.549
UNTIL THEN,

04:41.582 --> 04:43.384
I'LL JUST BE IN THE LIBRARY
WITH THE COLONEL

04:43.417 --> 04:45.519
HAVING

04:49.490 --> 04:52.560
OKAY, CAMPING TRIP CHECK.
BOOK FAIR PLEDGE.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.528
OH, AND IF YOU COULD TELL
LAURIE MARVIN

04:54.562 --> 04:56.430
SHE CAN SHOVE

04:56.464 --> 04:58.065

ONLY KIDDING.
2:00 TO 4:00 SHIFT.

05:00.701 --> 05:03.003
PLUS, I'M MAKING
BLONDIES.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.038
SO EAT THAT, ALICE.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.507
I LIKE YOUR GLASSES.

05:06.540 --> 05:09.510
WHY'S YOUR SISTER
WEARING DARK GLASSES?

05:09.543 --> 05:10.778
SHADE OUT DRUGS DAY.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.045
TOMORROW'S

05:13.547 --> 05:14.748
LOOK AT YOU
WITH THE SCHOOL SPIRIT!

05:14.782 --> 05:16.584
NOT REALLY.

05:16.617 --> 05:18.051
SHE'S JUST DOING IT BECAUSE
OTHERWISE WE GET DETENTION.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.087
FUCKING BENEDICT
DOUCHE BAG.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.855
IS THIS FORM FOR SCHOOL?

05:21.889 --> 05:23.123
NO, ACTUALLY.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.493
IT'S, UM,
IT'S A PARENTAL CONSENT

05:25.526 --> 05:27.628
FOR THIS THEATER THING
I'M DOING.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.497
WHAT THEATER THING?

05:29.530 --> 05:30.898
(Marshall)
IT'S FOR HALLOWEEN.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.866
IT'S LIKE A HAUNTED HOUSE
KIND OF DEAL.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.735
WAIT,
IS IT A HELL HOUSE?
A WHAT?

05:34.768 --> 05:36.470
THIS EVANGELICAL PLAY

05:36.504 --> 05:38.372
TO SCARE KIDS STRAIGHT.

05:38.406 --> 05:40.874
[gasps]
MAYBE YOU CAN BE
A GANG RAPER?
NO.

05:40.908 --> 05:42.142
LET'S SEE, IT SAYS HERE,

05:42.175 --> 05:43.911
"YOUTH QUAKIN',
SOUL SHAKIN'

05:43.944 --> 05:46.113
"KEEP YOU FROM WAKIN' UP
SATAN'S BACON

05:46.146 --> 05:47.715
"CUTTING EDGE

05:47.748 --> 05:49.717
EVANGELISM TOOL
OF THE '90s."

05:49.750 --> 05:51.819
THEY OUGHTA CHANGE THAT
RIGHT NOW.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.921
I'M JUST DOING IT
TO INFILTRATE.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.856
I'M WRITING AN EXTRA CREDIT
EXPOSE FOR SOCIAL STUDIES.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.558
OH, MARSHY,

05:57.591 --> 05:59.460
I THINK YOU'RE JOINING
THE GOD SQUAD

05:59.493 --> 06:01.529
IN ORDER TO GET CLOSER
TO JASON.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.664
AND MYSTERY SOLVED.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.834

06:08.736 --> 06:10.037
(Max)
HEY, KNOCK IT OFF!

06:10.070 --> 06:12.540
IF MARSHALL WANTS TO PUT
HIS TIME INTO THIS,

06:12.573 --> 06:13.941
I'M SURE HE HAS
A VERY GOOD REASON.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.909
HMM. YEAH.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.678

06:25.953 --> 06:27.721
I-I CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU,
NEIL.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.458
I GUESS MARIJUANA
IS A GATEWAY DRUG AFTER ALL.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.826
WHY'D HE CALL YOU
FROM THE IKEA PARKING LOT?

06:32.860 --> 06:34.795
OLIVE GARDEN WAITRESS
WOULDN'T GO HOME WITH HIM,

06:34.828 --> 06:36.597
SO HE DROVE 3 FEET
AND PASSED OUT.

06:36.630 --> 06:37.931
FUCK!

06:37.965 --> 06:39.700
THIS IS A NEW CLIENT,
HUGE PROPERTY.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.603
HOW AM I GONNA AERATE
THIS LADY'S LAWN IN ONE DAY?

06:42.636 --> 06:43.837
WAS THAT RHETORICAL?

06:43.871 --> 06:45.873
BECAUSE IT SOUNDED
EUPHEMISTICALLY FILTHY.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.944
WHAT?

06:50.978 --> 06:53.714
NO! DAD...I HAVE A QUIZ
IN FRENCH FOURTH PERIOD.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.048
I'LL GET YOU BACK

07:05.593 --> 07:07.094
(Tiffany)
NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT, HONEY?

07:07.127 --> 07:09.530
IT'S NOT SATURATION.
IT'S TIMING.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.932
THEY DON'T WANT US
IN UGANDA, COOLIO, OKAY?

07:11.965 --> 07:14.001
BUT DON'T YOU TELL ME
THAT WE'RE DONE IN WINNIPEG,

07:14.034 --> 07:15.469
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST
FEAR TALKING,

07:15.503 --> 07:17.104
AND I DON'T PLAY THAT.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.609
O-OKAY, HONEY,
CAN I BUZZ YOU BACK?

07:21.642 --> 07:23.176
THAT'S JEFF

07:23.210 --> 07:24.612
OKAY, BYE, HONEY.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.814
HEY, HIMBO,

OKAY, BOOK IT AND COOK IT.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.618
I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON.

07:30.651 --> 07:31.819
OKAY, BYE.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.086
OH...

07:33.120 --> 07:34.888
MY GOD!

07:34.922 --> 07:36.256
I CAME HOME LATE,

07:36.289 --> 07:38.859
SO I DIDN'T GET TO SEE
WHAT YOU DID YESTERDAY!

07:38.892 --> 07:40.728
OH, IT'S AMAZING.
I LOVE IT.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.796
IT'S LIKE
IT'S GLOWING.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.231
I PUT MICA
IN THE PIGMENT.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.166
OH...YOU KNOW,
I AM SO GLAD

07:46.199 --> 07:49.169
YOU GOT ME TO GO WITH
INSPIRATION OVER MOTIVATION.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.171
OH, GOD, I JUST WANNA LIVE
IN THERE, RIGHT?

07:51.204 --> 07:52.806
[chuckling]

07:52.840 --> 07:54.908
ARE YOUR OTHER PERSONALITIES
ALL SO TALENTED?

07:54.942 --> 07:57.811
WELL, UH, ALICE
PLAYS THE PIANO.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.179
YES.
SHE'S NOT VERY GOOD,
APPARENTLY.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.181
JUST MOVES HER ARMS
AROUND A LOT.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.650
[doorbell rings]

08:02.683 --> 08:04.685
OH, YOU NEED TO KEEP
THAT ROCK.

08:04.718 --> 08:05.953
I MEAN IT.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.088
PEOPLE ALWAYS PICK
THE ONE THEY NEED.

08:08.121 --> 08:11.191
WHO IS AT OUR DOOR?

08:11.224 --> 08:12.526
(Charmaine)
HEY.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.861
HEY, SUGAR,
COME ON IN.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.195
HOW'S IT GOING?

08:15.228 --> 08:17.698
WELL, I ONLY HAVE
FOUR RSVPs,

08:17.731 --> 08:19.733
SO MAYBE I COULD GET
ANOTHER WEEK

08:19.767 --> 08:21.635
BEFORE THE BYYCB PARTY.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.003
OH, HEY...TARA.

08:23.036 --> 08:26.940
UM...THAT'S THE BEST YOU
YOU CAN BE PARTY.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.909
UM...I ALREADY
INVITED YOU,

08:28.942 --> 08:31.979
BUT YOU SAID YOU DON'T HAVE
DISPOSABLE INCOME.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.615
OKAY, LET ME SEE
THESE WORK SHEETS.

08:34.648 --> 08:36.550
OKAY, WHY IS THIS ONE
CROSSED OUT?

08:36.584 --> 08:39.853
UH...I TALKED PAST
THE "YES."

08:39.887 --> 08:42.222
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME.

08:42.255 --> 08:45.225
I AM NOT GONNA SAY
THAT THIS ISN'T GONNA BE HARD,

08:45.258 --> 08:47.995
BECAUSE TO DO ANYTHING
OF MEASURE TAKES WORK.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.930
BUT YOU CAN EITHER STAND HERE
AND SAY,

08:49.963 --> 08:52.666
"WHY IS EVERYTHING
ALWAYS HAPPENING TO ME?"

08:52.700 --> 08:55.235
OR YOU CAN TAKE CONTROL

08:55.268 --> 08:56.937
AND SEE WHAT YOUR LIFE
CAN BECOME

08:56.970 --> 08:59.206
WHEN YOU REALLY LET
YOUR LIGHT SHINE.

08:59.239 --> 09:00.307
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.242
[giggling]

09:02.275 --> 09:04.645
I'LL COME
TO YOUR PARTY, CHARMIE.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.246
YOU SEE THAT?

09:06.279 --> 09:08.081
ALL RIGHT,
NOW GO PICK OUT A ROCK.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.049
OKAY.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.720
(Tara)
SO SHE'S RECOMMENDED ME

09:12.753 --> 09:14.722
TO THIS HEAD HONCHO
AT THE WORLD HEADQUARTERS

09:14.755 --> 09:17.257
TO DO SOMETHING
IN THE EXECUTIVE DINING ROOM,

09:17.290 --> 09:18.992
WHICH IS SO GENEROUS.

09:19.026 --> 09:22.596
TIFFANY MUST BE
VERY PLEASED WITH YOUR WORK.

09:22.630 --> 09:25.733
YEAH!

09:25.766 --> 09:28.335
IS THAT HARD FOR YOU
TO ADMIT TO YOURSELF?

09:28.368 --> 09:30.638
NO.

09:30.671 --> 09:31.905
I MEAN...

09:31.939 --> 09:34.675
IT IS, BUT...

09:34.708 --> 09:36.777
AND WORSE THAN THAT...

09:36.810 --> 09:38.646
WHEN I WAS DRIVING HERE
TODAY,

09:38.679 --> 09:42.282
I HAD THIS...
FEELING.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.718
YOU'RE GONNA THINK
I'M INSANE.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.287
WELL, I'M SURE
YOU ALREADY DO.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.289
IT'S JUST...

09:49.322 --> 09:52.760
I HAVEN'T HAD
A REAL FRIEND IN SO LONG,

09:52.793 --> 09:54.995
IT'S KINDA SCARY
TO BE HOPEFUL.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.297
DON'T EVEN WANNA SAY IT
OUT LOUD.

09:57.330 --> 10:00.300
WELL...PEOPLE
WHO'VE BEEN THROUGH TRAUMA

10:00.333 --> 10:01.935
DON'T BELIEVE
THEY'RE LOVABLE.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.304
YOU'VE BEEN CARRYING
THAT NEGATIVE PROGRAMMING

10:04.337 --> 10:06.640
FOR A LONG TIME,
SO IT'S GONNA TAKE A WHILE

10:06.674 --> 10:09.009
FOR YOU TO REALLY TRUST
A NEW PERSON.

10:09.042 --> 10:10.310
I JUST WISH I HAD
MORE OF A HANDLE

10:10.343 --> 10:11.745
ON WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.313
WELL, YOUR ALTERS KNOW.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.649
THAT'S WHY THE SYSTEM
WAS CREATED TO PROTECT YOU.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.384
SO YOU COULD LIVE
THROUGH SCHOOL,

10:17.417 --> 10:19.987
SO YOU COULD GO TO COLLEGE,

10:20.020 --> 10:22.322
SO THAT YOU COULD
MEET AND MARRY MAX

10:22.355 --> 10:24.057
AND RAISE
THOSE AMAZING KIDS.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.059
[laughing]

10:26.093 --> 10:27.661
I'M SORRY
MY PARTS ARE SO SHY

10:27.695 --> 10:29.129
ABOUT COMING OUT
IN HERE.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.263
IT'S--

10:30.297 --> 10:31.965
OH, WE HAVE
LOTS OF TIME, HONEY.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.934
MAYBE...

10:33.967 --> 10:36.870
TARA NEEDS SPACE

10:36.904 --> 10:38.939
TO TAKE IT ALL IN.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.340
TAKE ALL WHAT IN?

10:40.373 --> 10:42.042
WELL, LOOK AT YOU.

10:42.075 --> 10:43.443
YOU'RE FACING LIFE
HEAD-ON.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.212
YOU'VE GOT
SATISFYING WORK.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.880
YOU'VE GOT A NEW FRIEND.

10:46.914 --> 10:49.382
YOU SHOULD BE SO PROUD
OF YOURSELF!

10:52.920 --> 10:55.355
SO IS THIS, UM...

10:55.388 --> 10:57.991
DOES THIS QUALIFY
AS A BREAKTHROUGH?

10:58.025 --> 10:59.927
YOU BET!

11:01.394 --> 11:03.163
WELL, SMELL ME!

11:03.196 --> 11:04.965
[laughing]

11:04.998 --> 11:06.233
OKAY, THEN WHEN YOU GET GOING,

11:06.266 --> 11:08.068
YOU JUST DROP THIS DOWN.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.003
(Marshall)
WHOA, NELLY!
GIVE IT SOME GAS.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.873
YEAH, THERE YA GO!

11:12.906 --> 11:14.241
WHOO! YEAH!

11:14.274 --> 11:15.308

11:15.342 --> 11:16.309
ROCK AND ROLL!

11:16.343 --> 11:17.410
YEAH!

11:20.513 --> 11:21.782
YEAH! WHOO!

11:21.815 --> 11:23.083
SLOW DOWN.

11:25.953 --> 11:28.388
[laughing]

11:28.421 --> 11:30.123
[bees buzzing]

11:32.425 --> 11:33.861
DAD! DAD!

11:33.894 --> 11:36.263
I HAD ONE IN HERE.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.731
MOTHERFUCKER!

11:37.765 --> 11:39.399
(Marshall)
IN MY BRIEFCASE.

11:39.432 --> 11:43.270
[Marshall groaning]

11:49.309 --> 11:51.178
AH, FUCK!

11:51.211 --> 11:53.847
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,

11:53.881 --> 11:57.050
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT,

11:57.084 --> 11:58.819
NINE, TEN.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.954
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.455
(Charmaine)
WHOO, MY ARMS!

12:02.489 --> 12:04.224
(Kate)
I KNOW!

12:04.257 --> 12:06.459
GUYS, WE ARE DOING
SO GREAT!

12:06.493 --> 12:09.429
REMEMBER, ANYTHING OF MEASURE
TAKES WORK, DOESN'T IT?

12:09.462 --> 12:10.964
(dishwasher brother)
FUCK, YEAH!

12:10.998 --> 12:12.800
ALSO REMEMBER
THAT WHICHEVER ONE OF YOU

12:12.833 --> 12:14.101
DOES THE MOST CARS

12:14.134 --> 12:16.303
GETS THIS VERY POSH
VITA-SELF HOODIE

12:16.336 --> 12:18.806
IN ADDITION TO THE CASH
I'M GIVING YOU.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.908
(man)
HEY, ARE THESE YOURS?

12:20.941 --> 12:23.043
YEAH.
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

12:23.076 --> 12:26.046
WE DO VITA-SELF HERE.
IT'S OUR MALL.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.747
IT'S EVERYBODY'S MALL,
SUDOKU.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.318
ALL RIGHT, IT'S YOUR MALL.

12:31.351 --> 12:34.054
NO PROBLEM.
IT'S ALL GOOD.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.356
GET THE FUCKING FLYERS.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.457
SORRY.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.493
AH...
I KNOW, IT--

12:42.095 --> 12:44.832
OW. I THINK
THAT'S ENOUGH, MOM.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.433
OKAY.
[laughs]

12:46.466 --> 12:48.501
OH, GOD,
YOU SHOULD REST UP.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.938
YEAH, I'M JUST GONNA WATCH
BRIEF ENCOUNTER

12:50.971 --> 12:52.239
AND COOL MY HEELS.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.340
NICE.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.409
AND, MOM,
IT WAS PRETTY FUN

12:56.443 --> 12:57.945
UNTIL MY THROAT
CLOSED UP.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.447
SO DON'T CHEW DAD
A NEW ONE.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.349
HEY, I WISH YOU WOULD.
IT'D MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.084
I DON'T HAVE
THE ENERGY.
YEAH, YOU DO.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.153
HE'S ALLERGIC,
AND I LOST MY EPI PEN.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.487
PLUS, YOU TOOK HIM
OUT OF SCHOOL.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.356
OH, SO YOU ARE MAD.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.959
OF COURSE I'M MAD.
HE COULD HAVE BEEN REALLY HURT.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.127
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

13:14.161 --> 13:16.029
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE

13:16.063 --> 13:17.965
THAT'S EVER SCREWED UP
AROUND HERE.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.466
YOU WANNA GIVE ME
THE LAUNDRY LIST?

13:19.499 --> 13:21.401
NO, I DON'T.

13:21.434 --> 13:24.037
YOU DON'T WANNA REMIND ME ABOUT
THE TIME T LEFT THE IRON ON

13:24.071 --> 13:25.973
AND KATIE BURNED HERSELF
AND GOT A BUBBLE ON HER HAND,

13:26.006 --> 13:27.507
AND SINCE SHE WAS STILL CRAWLING
IT KEPT SPLITTING OPEN?

13:27.540 --> 13:28.976
WILL YOU KNOCK IT OFF?

13:29.009 --> 13:30.543
COME ON--I WANNA HEAR
ALL MY OFFENSES.

13:30.577 --> 13:33.513
DON'T YOU HAVE THEM METICULOUSLY
LISTED ON YOUR COMPUTER?

13:33.546 --> 13:35.415
YEAH, SO YOU'LL KNOW EVERYTHING,
SO WE WON'T HAVE SECRETS.

13:35.448 --> 13:38.118
COME ON, YOU THINK
I WANNA TELL YOU THAT STUFF?

13:39.953 --> 13:41.521
TARA.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.991
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS--
200 BUCKS' WORTH OF FLYERS

13:44.024 --> 13:45.993
AND A WHOLE DAY'S WORK
DOWN THE DRAIN.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.895
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY ME,
AUNT CHARMAINE.

13:47.928 --> 13:50.263
OH, THAT'S NICE, SWEETIE.

13:50.297 --> 13:51.999
[sighs]

13:52.032 --> 13:54.567
BUT I STILL HAVE 600 WORTH
OF ELIXIRS AT HOME,

13:54.601 --> 13:57.504
AND NOBODY
WANTS TO BUY IT.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.272
DO YOU KNOW
HOW MANY PEOPLE

13:59.306 --> 14:01.008
ARE TRYING TO UNLOAD
THIS STUFF ON EBAY?

14:01.041 --> 14:03.510
EVEN AT ALL
THE FAKE EBAYS.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.512
I HAD NO IDEA.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.115
MAYBE WE CAN TALK
TO MY MANAGER...

14:08.148 --> 14:09.950
SET SOMETHING UP
AT BARNABEEZ.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.518
REALLY?
SURE.

14:11.551 --> 14:14.021
I MEAN, ISN'T THERE
SOME SORT OF VITA-SELF SLOGAN

14:14.054 --> 14:17.157
ABOUT MAKING YOUR OWN FUTURE
BY INNOVATING YOUR PRESENT?

14:17.190 --> 14:19.559
I'M JUST SO BLOWN AWAY

14:19.592 --> 14:22.562
BY THE POWER OF VITA-SELF!

14:22.595 --> 14:24.597
[laughing]

14:35.275 --> 14:37.444
MOM...CAN I SKIP
SCHOOL TODAY?

14:37.477 --> 14:39.212
I'LL GET THE HOMEWORK.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.949
OKAY. DON'T YOU HAVE
REHEARSAL AFTER SCHOOL?

14:41.982 --> 14:44.584
THEY DON'T NEED ME.

14:44.617 --> 14:47.087
IF YOU LIKE HIM,
HE MUST BE A GREAT GUY.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.956
AND IF HE LIKES YOU,

14:48.989 --> 14:51.558
THEN HE WON'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT THE BEE STINGS.

14:51.591 --> 14:54.027
IF YOU DON'T SHOW UP,
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.400
AT LEAST HE DOES IT
IN THE SHOWER.

15:00.433 --> 15:04.004
MY EX USED TO HAVE
HIS GENTLEMAN'S TIME

15:04.037 --> 15:05.338
RIGHT NEXT TO ME IN BED.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.606
OH!
EWW!

15:06.639 --> 15:08.508
I DON'T CARE WHAT HE SAYS.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.343
I JUST--
I'M NEVER GONNA BELIEVE

15:10.377 --> 15:12.212
THAT I KNOW HOW TO DO IT
BETTER THAN HE DOES.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.446
MM-HMM.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.682
I MEAN, I KNOW T
DOESN'T FEEL THAT WAY,

15:15.715 --> 15:17.084
WHICH IS, I'M SURE,

15:17.117 --> 15:19.953
PART OF HER SKANK
MUFFIN APPEAL.

15:19.987 --> 15:21.554
SO HOW DOES IT WORK,
YOU KNOW?

15:21.588 --> 15:23.090
DO YOU GUYS HAVE,
LIKE, RULES

15:23.123 --> 15:25.025
ABOUT HAVING SEX
WITH THE ALTERS?

15:25.058 --> 15:27.560
WELL, THE FIRST D.I.D.
THERAPIST

15:27.594 --> 15:29.296
SAID IT SHOULD BE
MY CHOICE.

15:29.329 --> 15:30.630
MM-HMM.

15:30.663 --> 15:33.166
AND I FELT BAD ABOUT PUTTING MAX
THROUGH SO MUCH,

15:33.200 --> 15:34.634
SO I WAS LIKE,
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.569
WHICH HE DID...WITH T.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.106
UNTIL HE REALIZED
SHE WAS STUCK AT 16.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.640
AND THAT KINDA PUT
A DAMPER ON THINGS.
GOTCHA.

15:40.673 --> 15:44.244
BASICALLY, WE...
MUTUALLY AGREED.

15:44.277 --> 15:47.614
IT'S...TOO MESSY
IF HE FUCKS MY ALTERS.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.649
WELL, YOU KNOW...
[laughs]

15:49.682 --> 15:51.184
WHEN I BLOW ROGER,

15:51.218 --> 15:53.586
I PRETEND I'M N'ICHELLE

15:53.620 --> 15:56.223
FROM THAT FOX SHOW
WITH THE GRAINY STREETWALKERS?

15:56.256 --> 15:58.558
IT'S, LIKE, THE ONLY WAY
I CAN GET THROUGH IT.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.693
HONESTLY, I THINK
YOU ARE A GENIUS.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.163
I REALLY DO.

16:03.196 --> 16:06.166
YEAH, BUT IT--IT'S
DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW?

16:06.199 --> 16:10.037
WHEN YOU'RE N'ICHELLE,
YOU'RE STILL IN THE ROOM.

16:10.070 --> 16:13.040
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE I AM.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.674
WHAT IS IT, HONEY?

16:14.707 --> 16:17.277
WHAT'S WRONG?

16:17.310 --> 16:19.179
[laughs]
SORRY, IT'S JUST--

16:19.212 --> 16:20.247
NO...

16:20.280 --> 16:22.282
MAX AND I...

16:22.315 --> 16:24.417
HAVEN'T BEEN VERY,
UM...

16:24.451 --> 16:26.686
CONNECTED.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.721
WELL...I'M SORRY,

16:28.755 --> 16:31.024
BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW THAT'S ANY DIFFERENT

16:31.058 --> 16:33.293
FROM ANY OTHER COUPLE
WHO'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR A WHILE.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.628
REALLY?
LISTEN,
I HATE TO DISAPPOINT YOU,

16:35.662 --> 16:38.131
BUT THAT IS LIKE
THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCES

16:38.165 --> 16:41.168
OF UNSEXY DAILY LIFE
PLUS BIOLOGY.

16:41.201 --> 16:44.337
YOU KNOW, YOU NAME ME
ONE COUPLE YOUR AGE

16:44.371 --> 16:47.207
WHO HAS SEX
MORE THAN ONCE A WEEK

16:47.240 --> 16:49.676
WHO ARE NOT TV CHARACTERS.

16:52.379 --> 16:53.580
THANK YOU.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.082
AND THIS IS WHY
WE DRINK.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.516
[snickers]

16:56.549 --> 16:58.285
MM.

17:01.788 --> 17:02.789
(girl)
HEY, KATE.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.124
HEY.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.527
HELLO, KITTY.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.529
WHY DO YOU
ALWAYS CALL ME THAT?

17:09.562 --> 17:11.764
WORKERS LIKE NICKNAMES.
WE HAVE SOLID DATA.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.101
HEY, SO I HAVE A LINE

17:14.134 --> 17:15.835
ON AN EXCELLENT
PRODUCT DISCOUNT.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.105
LOVE THAT WORD.
HIT ME.

17:18.138 --> 17:19.239
PROTEIN POWDER.

17:19.272 --> 17:20.740
I MEAN, PEOPLE LOVE
HEALTHY SHAKES.

17:20.773 --> 17:23.510
SO WE COULD TIE IT
INTO SOME SORT OF...FIT MENU?

17:23.543 --> 17:25.178
WE DON'T DO THAT.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.814
NEXT TIME
DO YOUR HOMEWORK.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.292
I'M SORRY I LEFT
THE IRON ON.

17:39.326 --> 17:42.429
I'M SORRY I DON'T REMEMBER
LEAVING THE IRON ON.

17:44.597 --> 17:45.832
BABE...

17:45.865 --> 17:47.267
IT ISN'T JUST
THAT I CAN'T REMEMBER

17:47.300 --> 17:48.668
WHOLE CHUNKS
OF MY CHILDHOOD

17:48.701 --> 17:50.570
OR ALMOST KILLING
OUR CHILDREN.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.772
AND IT DOESN'T ONLY HAPPEN
WHEN THE ALTERS ARE OUT

17:52.805 --> 17:54.407
AND DOING STUFF
THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

17:54.441 --> 17:57.110
I'VE BEEN FADING IN AND OUT
FOREVER, MAX.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.111
[sighs]

17:58.145 --> 17:59.446
UNTIL I QUIT THE MEDS,

17:59.479 --> 18:00.713
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HOW MUCH I'D LOST.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.782
HOW MUCH GOOD STUFF.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.118
I REMEMBER
I MET YOU AT A PARTY,

18:05.152 --> 18:08.588
BUT THAT'S IT.

18:08.621 --> 18:09.889
MY HEAD IS SO MESSED UP,

18:09.922 --> 18:12.892
I LITERALLY HAVE NO MEMORY
OF OUR FIRST DATE.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.129
HONEY...WE GOT HIGH A LOT
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED GOING OUT.

18:16.163 --> 18:17.797
NO, NO, NO.

18:17.830 --> 18:20.400
THE POINT IS, I MISSED IT.
I CAN'T REMINISCE...

18:20.433 --> 18:24.271
WITH YOU.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.472
I MEAN, HOW CAN YOU MAKE

18:25.505 --> 18:26.873
A LIFETIME OF MEMORIES
WITH SOMEONE

18:26.906 --> 18:28.508
WHEN THE PERSON
YOU'RE SPENDING IT WITH

18:28.541 --> 18:30.610
ISN'T EVEN THERE?

18:34.681 --> 18:38.351
WHAT DID WE DO?

18:38.385 --> 18:41.321
WE MADE A CASSEROLE THING
WITH A CAN OF MUSHROOM SOUP,

18:41.354 --> 18:43.823
BURNED THE SHIT OUT OF IT,
SET OFF ALL THE ALARMS.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.426
WELL, I WANNA MAKE
NEW MEMORIES,

18:46.459 --> 18:48.228
AND I WANT
OUR SEX LIFE BACK.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.830
OUR SEX LIFE.

18:50.863 --> 18:53.800
AND IF WE NEVER HAD ONE,
THEN I WANNA MAKE ONE.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.735
[chuckles]

18:55.768 --> 18:57.470
OH, WE HAD ONE.

18:57.504 --> 19:00.139
WHY DO YOU THINK YOU BURNED
THE SHIT OUT OF THE CHICKEN?

19:04.277 --> 19:08.215
[overlapping chatter]

19:08.248 --> 19:09.549
GREAT WORK, GUYS.
GREAT WORK, EVERYBODY.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.284
REALLY LOOKING GOOD.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.753
WELCOME.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.222
WE'RE JUST ABOUT
TO GET STARTED.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.689
OH, KIMMY!

19:16.723 --> 19:18.758
KIMMY'LL CATCH YOU UP
ON THE BLOCKING, OKAY?

19:20.893 --> 19:23.863
EWW. WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR FACE?

19:23.896 --> 19:26.733
SHUT UP, KIMMY.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.974
I HAD A BAD BUG ENCOUNTER.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.609
EESH!

19:36.643 --> 19:37.977
DOES THAT HURT?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.312
YES.

19:39.346 --> 19:42.449
I MEAN...NO.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.784
YOU'RE SO CUTE.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.219
THANK YOU.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.389
[groaning]

19:49.422 --> 19:50.890
IT'S JUST COMPLICATED

19:50.923 --> 19:52.492
'CAUSE IT'S A NATIONAL CHAIN
AND EVERYTHING.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.827
OH, YOU'RE A SWEETHEART
FOR TRYING.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.363
OH!

19:56.396 --> 19:58.498

19:58.531 --> 19:59.799

20:02.802 --> 20:04.604
SORRY I'M LATE.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.606
WE STARTED WITHOUT YOU.

20:06.639 --> 20:08.408
EXCUSE ME, CAN I GET
ONE OF, UH...

20:08.441 --> 20:09.776
WHATEVER THEY'RE HAVING...

20:09.809 --> 20:11.344

20:12.445 --> 20:13.413
HI.

20:13.446 --> 20:14.947

20:14.981 --> 20:17.250
DID YOU CLOSE THAT DEAL?

20:18.785 --> 20:21.454
YAY! GOOD GIRL!

20:21.488 --> 20:23.290
GOOD GIRL!
DRINKS ARE ON YOU.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.725
OH, GOOD.
I'LL HAVE A SIP OF THAT.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.560
A SIP?

20:27.594 --> 20:29.462
OH! OKAY.

20:30.597 --> 20:31.564
(Kate)
SEE YA.

20:31.598 --> 20:32.832
SEE YA.

20:35.034 --> 20:36.369
[coins jingle]

20:41.641 --> 20:43.376
I'LL SAY ONE THING.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.278
YOU'RE NOT THE GIRL
I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

20:45.312 --> 20:46.546
NO?

20:46.579 --> 20:48.948
PUTTING IT TOGETHER.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.683
SUPPLY, DEMAND.

20:50.717 --> 20:53.520
IT WASN'T THE RIGHT IDEA,
BUT...

20:53.553 --> 20:55.788
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU WERE THINKING LIKE?

20:58.825 --> 21:00.927
[whispering]
JUNIOR MANAGER.

21:05.432 --> 21:07.700
SOMEDAY, KITTY.

21:07.734 --> 21:09.736
SOMEDAY SOON.

21:09.769 --> 21:10.903
DO I GET A RAISE?

21:10.937 --> 21:13.005
[chuckles]

21:16.042 --> 21:18.044
SO THE DISASSOCIATION HAPPENS
WHEN YOU HAVE A TRIGGER, RIGHT?

21:18.077 --> 21:19.512
SORRY.
THANK YOU.

21:19.546 --> 21:22.915
AND IS THE TRIGGER SOMETHING
THAT REMINDS YOU

21:22.949 --> 21:26.386
OF, LIKE, SOME BAD THING
THAT HAPPENED TO YOU OR WHAT?

21:26.419 --> 21:28.888
YEAH, BUT LIKE A LOT
OF THE TRIGGERS ARE JUST WEIRD,

21:28.921 --> 21:31.724
LIKE, UH, THE SMELL
OF INSTANT COFFEE OR SOMETHING.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.526
I MEAN, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THAT MEANS.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.994
AND THERE WERE NO ALTERS
BEFORE THE EVENT,

21:35.027 --> 21:36.496
BUT YOU JUST HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED?

21:36.529 --> 21:38.731
AT BOARDING SCHOOL,
SHE HAD SEX WITH A GUY

21:38.765 --> 21:39.732
SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO HAVE SEX WITH.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.000
CHARMAINE!
WHAT?

21:41.033 --> 21:42.935
EVERYBODY HAS THEIR SHIT!

21:42.969 --> 21:44.737
BESIDES, THAT'S BACK WHEN "NO"
MEANT "GIVE HER ANOTHER DRINK."

21:44.771 --> 21:46.005
I MEAN, IF I HAD A NICKEL

21:46.038 --> 21:47.840
FOR EVERY GUY
I HAD DRUNK SEX WITH

21:47.874 --> 21:50.377
WHEN I DIDN'T WANT TO,
WELL...TCH.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.579
I WOULDN'T BE SELLING
VITA-FUCKIN'-SELF.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.716
WAIT. SO YOU'RE NOT BUYING
ANY OF THIS?

21:56.749 --> 21:58.418
LOOK...

21:58.451 --> 22:00.052
I WATCH 20/20, OKAY?

22:00.086 --> 22:02.555
I BELIEVE
THAT BAD THINGS HAPPEN

22:02.589 --> 22:04.391
THAT PEOPLE CAN'T REMEMBER.

22:04.424 --> 22:07.760
BUT, I MEAN, HOW COME
WHENEVER IT'S THIS D.I.D. THING,

22:07.794 --> 22:09.962
THE ABUSERS ARE ALWAYS
HOOKING UP ELECTRICAL BOXES

22:09.996 --> 22:11.698
TO THE KIDS' GENITALS?

22:11.731 --> 22:15.668
[shouting]
I MEAN, WHO HAS ELECTRICAL
BOXES READY TO GO?

22:15.702 --> 22:18.104
YOU ARE SCREAMING.

22:22.475 --> 22:24.611

THANK YOU.

22:24.644 --> 22:26.379

OF THOSE, PLEASE?

22:26.413 --> 22:27.814
THANK YOU.
OH, MY...

22:31.851 --> 22:33.753

22:33.786 --> 22:36.022
OH...TIFFANY,

22:36.055 --> 22:38.425
NO, I DO.
I DO!

22:38.458 --> 22:40.126
I'M NOT A DANCING MONKEY.

22:40.159 --> 22:42.562
OH, COME ON!
HELLO, WHO'S IN THERE?

22:42.595 --> 22:45.532
COME OUT AND HAVE
A DRINK WITH US.

22:45.565 --> 22:46.866
DID I MENTION
I WAS MOLESTED?

22:46.899 --> 22:48.801
I WAS.
[Charmaine laughing]

22:48.835 --> 22:50.069
[sing-song]
COME OUT, COME OUT,

22:50.102 --> 22:53.039

23:05.852 --> 23:07.019
[grunts]

23:09.088 --> 23:11.524
DID YOU HAVE FUN?

23:11.558 --> 23:14.060
NO.

23:14.093 --> 23:15.628
HMM.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.090
GOOD MORNING!

23:58.905 --> 23:59.972

NO, NO, NO.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.007
GET OUT.

24:12.519 --> 24:14.521
SO TIFFANY THINKS
ONE OF YOUR ALTERS

24:14.554 --> 24:17.156
BROKE INTO HER PLACE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

24:17.189 --> 24:21.027
I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO HAS HER KEY.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.228
OKAY.

24:22.261 --> 24:24.163
UM...

24:24.196 --> 24:27.233
I-IF IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME,
I CAN JUST SKIP REHEARSAL.

24:27.266 --> 24:28.568
NO, NO.

24:28.601 --> 24:30.002
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.670
UH-HUH.

25:11.277 --> 25:12.845
WHAT IS IT?

25:14.647 --> 25:15.815
A RESTRAINING ORDER.

25:17.049 --> 25:18.985
NO SHIT!

25:21.921 --> 25:25.825
[groaning, moaning]

VITA-SELF PRODUCTS.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.759

"FIND JOY."

26:21.313 --> 26:22.915
[laughs]

26:31.323 --> 26:34.260
SELF-SATISFIED BITCH.

26:38.297 --> 26:40.299
