21:08.500 --> 21:09.900
I'M HERE TO THANK YOU.

21:12.400 --> 21:15.467
IT TAKES A REAL MAN
TO APOLOGIZE IN PUBLIC...

21:15.467 --> 21:17.600
SHIRLEY.

21:20.200 --> 21:22.900
HE FORGOT
HIS COMBINATION AGAIN?

21:22.900 --> 21:25.867
WHY DOESN'T HE
JUST WRITE IT DOWN?

21:25.867 --> 21:28.500
I'M REALLY SORRY FOR
EVERYTHING I DID TO YOU.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.934
ZACK, IF YOU PROMISE
NOT TO LIE TO ME AGAIN,

21:31.934 --> 21:34.667
I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU
ANOTHER CHANCE.

21:34.667 --> 21:37.834
I'LL HAVE TO
THINK ABOUT IT. YES.

21:41.767 --> 21:43.400
OH, THIS IS GREAT.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.500
YOU EXPLOIT ME
AND MY PAPER,

21:45.500 --> 21:47.967
MANIPULATE A GIRL,
THEN ABANDON ME,

21:47.967 --> 21:51.200
DESTROY MY PAPER,
AND STILL GET THE GIRL?

21:51.200 --> 21:53.100
NOW WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

21:53.100 --> 21:55.800
DEAR LOSER...

22:02.200 --> 22:03.800
HOPE YOU HAD
A PLEASANT STAY,
MRS. WINTERS.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.100
GO OUTSIDE AND ENJOY
THAT BEAUTIFUL
SPRING DAY.

22:06.100 --> 22:08.800
[DING DING]

22:13.000 --> 22:16.100
ARE THESE YOUR BAAAGS?

22:17.500 --> 22:20.734
LET ME CALL YOU A CAAAAAB.

22:20.734 --> 22:22.500
ONE MORE LIKE THAT,

22:22.500 --> 22:25.400
AND THERE GOES
YOUR RAAAAISE.

22:25.400 --> 22:27.400
OK. I'M DONE.
