WEBVTT

00:00.128 --> 00:01.540
You are being so rude.

00:01.541 --> 00:02.941
And you're being such a bitch!

00:03.875 --> 00:05.042
Previously on "Mistresses"...

00:05.043 --> 00:08.278
I slept with my ex-boyfriend
while you were away.

00:08.280 --> 00:09.846
Goodbye, April.

00:09.848 --> 00:11.381
I'm sick again, Karen.

00:13.710 --> 00:14.500
That's Calista's car.

00:14.501 --> 00:16.138
That's her ring! That's Calista!

00:16.139 --> 00:17.617
Placing her at the scene of the crime

00:17.618 --> 00:18.902
at the time of the murder.

00:18.903 --> 00:19.708
Calista Raines,

00:19.709 --> 00:21.859
you are under arrest for
the murder of Luca Raines.

00:21.860 --> 00:23.526
I'm out, right? It's happening?

00:23.528 --> 00:24.761
Joss, I-I'm sorry.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.697
You're, uh, being charged
with co-conspiracy.

00:26.698 --> 00:28.298
They think you did it together.

00:29.634 --> 00:32.902
In a shocking, new development
in the Luca Raines murder case,

00:32.904 --> 00:34.805
fashion designer Calista Raines

00:34.806 --> 00:37.541
has been charged with
conspiracy to commit murder.

00:37.542 --> 00:40.511
Police have accused
Ms. Raines of conspiring

00:40.512 --> 00:43.881
with friend and business
associate Josslyn Carver,

00:43.882 --> 00:45.616
who was previously solely charged

00:45.617 --> 00:46.817
in connection with the...

00:49.621 --> 00:50.419
Harry.

00:50.421 --> 00:51.321
Have you seen the news?

00:51.322 --> 00:52.689
Just now. How is this happening?

00:52.690 --> 00:55.292
I thought that video of Calista
was supposed to get Joss out.

00:55.293 --> 00:56.393
Didn't David promise...

00:56.394 --> 00:57.661
yeah, I'm calling the bastard right now.

00:57.662 --> 00:59.295
- Call me after you talk to him.
- Okay. Will do.

00:59.297 --> 01:01.497
Bye.

01:03.735 --> 01:05.795
You said that we didn't
have to dress up for this.

01:06.771 --> 01:08.237
We don't.

01:11.309 --> 01:12.408
Should we go?

01:12.410 --> 01:14.144
Yeah.

01:16.548 --> 01:18.281
You didn't have to come here.

01:18.283 --> 01:19.403
You're not doing this alone.

01:20.418 --> 01:21.752
Oh, good. You brought a friend.

01:22.621 --> 01:23.954
Hi.

01:23.955 --> 01:26.155
I don't understand what happened.

01:26.158 --> 01:27.525
She was doing so well.

01:27.526 --> 01:30.194
As you know, when you
came into the picture,

01:30.195 --> 01:32.863
Vivian's aplastic anemia had all
but destroyed her bone marrow.

01:32.864 --> 01:34.265
She was barely kicking along.

01:34.266 --> 01:35.900
And the stem cells that you gave her

01:35.901 --> 01:38.369
helped her body to grow new
marrow, which was responsible

01:38.370 --> 01:40.404
for that burst of health
and energy that you saw.

01:41.506 --> 01:44.173
But, as I'm sure Vivian has told you...

01:45.377 --> 01:46.477
Okay.

01:46.478 --> 01:48.179
Um, during our check-up last week,

01:48.180 --> 01:50.314
I noticed a rash on her back.

01:50.315 --> 01:51.582
I ran some tests.

01:51.583 --> 01:53.017
What did you find?

01:53.018 --> 01:55.953
My body's rejecting your cells, Karen.

01:55.954 --> 01:57.988
It's graft versus host.

01:57.989 --> 02:00.722
It's a common hazard with transplants.

02:01.639 --> 02:02.571
Vivian?

02:04.508 --> 02:05.641
Please look at me.

02:07.045 --> 02:10.413
We will fix this. You'll be fine.

02:10.414 --> 02:12.749
So, what's the plan? Up her cyclosporine?

02:12.750 --> 02:14.752
And put her on prednisone, yeah.

02:14.753 --> 02:16.186
And what stage is she in?

02:16.187 --> 02:18.254
This is actually what I
called you in to discuss.

02:18.255 --> 02:21.257
Since your immune system's been
so compromised by the anemia,

02:21.258 --> 02:23.728
you could move through
the stages fairly quickly.

02:23.729 --> 02:26.364
Well, that's just speculative, right?

02:26.365 --> 02:28.298
I got your liver-function
tests back this morning.

02:28.300 --> 02:29.567
They, uh, showed an elevation

02:29.568 --> 02:31.267
in the alkaline phosphatase concentration.

02:31.268 --> 02:32.534
In English, please?

02:34.506 --> 02:36.507
Your liver is starting to fail.

02:36.508 --> 02:39.008
Vivian, you're on the verge of grade 2.

02:44.049 --> 02:45.349
How long do I have?

02:45.350 --> 02:46.584
We're not there yet.

02:46.585 --> 02:48.519
What about a liver transplant?

02:48.520 --> 02:49.887
I mean, with blood this unhealthy,

02:49.888 --> 02:51.489
that's... that's just simply not an option.

02:51.490 --> 02:52.822
How long, Dr. Jenkins?

02:54.592 --> 02:55.657
I don't know.

03:01.832 --> 03:05.634
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

03:05.637 --> 03:08.838
You know what I can't
stand more than cruelty?

03:08.840 --> 03:11.107
Incompetence.

03:11.109 --> 03:15.011
There I am at this hearing,
watching you fail miserably

03:15.013 --> 03:18.281
- Calista... - at persuading these
polyester-wearing pituitary cases

03:18.283 --> 03:21.251
that their ridiculous theory
is, indeed, ridiculous.

03:21.253 --> 03:23.419
It wasn't the forum to argue.

03:23.422 --> 03:25.488
They read the charge. We entered a plea.

03:25.490 --> 03:26.923
It's still "not guilty," right?

03:26.925 --> 03:28.892
Or... or did that change while
I was getting strip-searched

03:28.894 --> 03:30.527
by Mr. wonderful back there?

03:30.529 --> 03:32.395
Of course it's still "not guilty."

03:32.397 --> 03:34.831
So, what do they think...
that... that Joss held the gun

03:34.833 --> 03:36.099
and I pulled the trigger?

03:36.101 --> 03:37.567
No, that Joss pulled the trigger

03:37.569 --> 03:39.502
but you manipulated her into doing so

03:39.504 --> 03:41.337
and then left her to take the rap.

03:41.339 --> 03:42.573
So, what does that mean for me?

03:42.574 --> 03:43.773
In a conspiracy charge,

03:43.775 --> 03:45.341
you could both end up with
the same amount of time,

03:45.343 --> 03:46.609
regardless of who fired the gun.

03:46.611 --> 03:48.044
Neither of us fired the gun!

03:48.046 --> 03:49.846
Keep your voice down, Calista.

03:49.848 --> 03:53.816
The only conspiracy there was
was to frame him for cheating.

03:53.819 --> 03:55.051
That is it.

03:55.053 --> 03:56.686
I want to speak to the police.

03:56.688 --> 03:58.555
Okay? That's it. You know what?

03:58.557 --> 04:00.456
I want to tell the police the truth.

04:00.459 --> 04:02.460
I will back up everything that Joss said.

04:02.461 --> 04:05.094
You have lost all credibility.

04:05.097 --> 04:07.730
You've lied to the police.
You paid off an alibi.

04:07.732 --> 04:10.400
Any corroboration of Joss'
statement at this point

04:10.402 --> 04:12.268
would be seen as you retrofitting a story

04:12.270 --> 04:13.704
to... to suit you.

04:13.705 --> 04:14.971
So, find the gun, then.

04:14.973 --> 04:17.207
Find the gun, and it'll have
the murderer's prints on it,

04:17.209 --> 04:18.440
and they will not be mine.

04:18.442 --> 04:19.844
You've got an entire police force

04:19.845 --> 04:22.845
searching for that weapon...
to no avail, might I add.

04:22.848 --> 04:25.949
Putting me on that task is
a complete waste of our time.

04:25.951 --> 04:28.685
How about finding the person in
the video pretending to be me?

04:28.687 --> 04:30.753
Is that a complete waste of our time?

04:30.755 --> 04:32.589
I'm re-checking Eva's alibi

04:32.591 --> 04:35.158
and the alibis of Luca's other mistresses.

04:35.160 --> 04:37.860
I've even checked every car-rental place

04:37.863 --> 04:38.928
in Southern California

04:38.930 --> 04:40.964
for someone who may have rented

04:40.966 --> 04:43.099
a range rover identical to yours.

04:43.101 --> 04:45.902
- And?
- Unfortunately, nothing.

04:45.904 --> 04:49.105
Then check neighboring states.
Check Alaska, for all I care.

04:49.107 --> 04:50.473
Do something, Patty.

04:50.475 --> 04:52.141
That's not my car.

04:54.346 --> 04:55.845
You don't believe me, do you?

04:59.384 --> 05:01.784
If you don't believe me, you
can get the hell out of here.

05:01.786 --> 05:03.052
That's time, ladies.

05:05.657 --> 05:08.157
Obviously, we wanted Calista's
arrest to exonerate you,

05:08.160 --> 05:09.959
and I'm sorry that that didn't happen,

05:09.961 --> 05:11.327
but I talked to the D.A.,

05:11.329 --> 05:13.630
and they want Calista most for
this murder for two reasons.

05:13.632 --> 05:15.531
Uh, because she's evil,
and she deserves it?

05:15.534 --> 05:17.066
One... she's a public figure,

05:17.068 --> 05:19.535
and they don't want to be
accused of unfair leniency,

05:19.538 --> 05:21.437
and two... they see her

05:21.439 --> 05:23.773
as the puppeteer who
was pulling your strings.

05:23.775 --> 05:25.808
Okay, good. So, what does this mean?

05:25.810 --> 05:27.577
The D.A. is offering you a plea deal.

05:27.579 --> 05:28.946
Plea deal... okay.

05:28.947 --> 05:30.114
So, if you admit to shooting Luca

05:30.115 --> 05:31.549
and testify against Calista,

05:31.550 --> 05:34.051
you'll get a reduced
sentence of 10 to 12 years.

05:34.052 --> 05:36.219
If I admit to...

05:36.221 --> 05:37.520
hold on. What?

05:37.522 --> 05:38.889
- No, I...
- I agree.

05:38.890 --> 05:40.857
Wait. I-I don't even think
that I just said a full word.

05:40.859 --> 05:42.258
What are you talking about?

05:42.260 --> 05:44.694
You said no, and I concur.
You are not taking the deal.

05:44.696 --> 05:46.797
I'm required by law to
bring you every offer,

05:46.798 --> 05:48.564
but I'm not letting you plead guilty

05:48.567 --> 05:50.300
to a crime that you didn't commit.

05:50.302 --> 05:52.570
I mean, anything less than
"not guilty" is unacceptable.

05:52.571 --> 05:53.603
Okay.

05:53.605 --> 05:55.472
Even if we have to appeal and appeal.

05:56.474 --> 05:58.309
So, we have 48 hours to respond,

05:58.310 --> 06:00.076
but, obviously, this is clear.

06:00.078 --> 06:02.211
I mean, we're gonna find
another way to give them Calista.

06:02.214 --> 06:03.079
Okay.

06:03.081 --> 06:04.213
Okay?

06:04.216 --> 06:06.683
And...

06:06.685 --> 06:08.985
I mean, I-if we don't, how...

06:10.455 --> 06:12.822
how many years could I get if...
if this thing goes to trial?

06:12.824 --> 06:13.756
Joss...

06:13.758 --> 06:15.491
please, just... David, I...

06:15.493 --> 06:17.060
I need to know, okay?

06:18.129 --> 06:19.429
20 to life.

06:24.070 --> 06:25.467
This is a process,

06:25.468 --> 06:27.444
and you have to be patient with it,

06:27.445 --> 06:30.412
but I have to say, I'm
hopeful about you two.

06:30.413 --> 06:31.846
In one session alone,

06:31.847 --> 06:34.749
I saw a positive shift in your interaction.

06:34.750 --> 06:37.350
Anything you'd like to add before we end?

06:39.254 --> 06:42.056
Lucy, would you mind if I talked
to your mom alone for a sec?

06:42.057 --> 06:42.922
Sure.

06:44.927 --> 06:46.459
There are some magazines outside.

06:46.461 --> 06:47.527
Okay.

06:49.531 --> 06:50.964
What is it?

06:51.934 --> 06:54.300
Oh, God.

06:54.303 --> 06:56.102
I'm a terrible mother.

06:56.104 --> 06:57.137
Why do you say that?

06:57.139 --> 06:58.572
I slapped my child!

06:58.573 --> 07:00.975
Lucy heard your apology and forgave you.

07:00.976 --> 07:02.677
I promised myself I would do it different

07:02.678 --> 07:03.911
than my parents.

07:03.912 --> 07:05.913
You are doing it differently.

07:05.914 --> 07:08.950
One misstep doesn't invalidate
years of good parenting.

07:08.951 --> 07:10.117
Well, lately, it seems like

07:10.118 --> 07:11.886
all I've been making are missteps.

07:11.887 --> 07:13.220
Not from where I sit.

07:13.221 --> 07:14.588
Well, you just met me.

07:14.589 --> 07:16.324
Was it a misstep to bring Scotty and Marc

07:16.325 --> 07:17.390
into Lucy's life?

07:18.961 --> 07:21.429
She clearly loves having
them in the family.

07:21.430 --> 07:24.031
She loves taking care of Scotty.

07:24.032 --> 07:26.567
It makes her feel like a part
of her father's still with her.

07:26.568 --> 07:29.135
And you saw how she smiled
when she talked about Marc.

07:30.572 --> 07:33.874
He's brought her a lot of joy
and made her feel less alone.

07:33.875 --> 07:37.078
And that happened because
you were selfless enough

07:37.079 --> 07:39.547
to step way outside your comfort zone

07:39.548 --> 07:41.115
and let those people in.

07:41.116 --> 07:44.084
They have been good for her.

07:44.987 --> 07:46.886
What about for you?

07:51.827 --> 07:52.893
No, it's not Larry David.

07:52.894 --> 07:55.261
It's Harry Davis calling for David.

07:55.263 --> 07:56.696
Don't put me on hold again.

07:56.698 --> 07:58.099
April broke up with Blair...

07:58.100 --> 08:00.266
dropped him like the 180 pounds
of deadweight that he was.

08:00.268 --> 08:02.302
Yeah, voice-mail is fine. Thank you.

08:03.905 --> 08:06.673
David, it's Harry again.
Call me back... please.

08:07.676 --> 08:08.708
Unbelievable.

08:08.710 --> 08:10.543
Joss didn't get out?

08:11.847 --> 08:14.215
Oh, God. I'm sorry, man.
Have you seen her yet?

08:14.216 --> 08:15.349
They won't let me till this afternoon,

08:15.350 --> 08:16.916
and her lawyer's not returning my calls.

08:16.918 --> 08:18.953
- I'm going out of my mind.
- It's okay. Just take a breath.

08:18.954 --> 08:20.621
I feel like ripping someone's head off!

08:20.622 --> 08:21.922
I-I know, I know.

08:21.923 --> 08:23.991
Just...

08:23.992 --> 08:25.259
Look, if you're seeing her today,

08:25.260 --> 08:26.694
you can't show up looking like you do.

08:26.695 --> 08:28.275
Why? What do you mean? How do I look?

08:29.131 --> 08:30.164
Terrified.

08:30.165 --> 08:32.066
All I'm saying is, it might scare her,

08:32.067 --> 08:34.835
so just... just be positive, hopeful.

08:34.836 --> 08:37.203
That's the best thing you
can do for her right now.

08:38.673 --> 08:40.640
Yeah. Thanks, mate.

08:42.477 --> 08:44.377
Hey, man, you should seize the day.

08:44.379 --> 08:46.279
- What's that?
- April.

08:46.281 --> 08:48.414
Tell her how you feel.

08:48.417 --> 08:50.316
She could be taken from you tomorrow.

08:54.189 --> 08:55.289
Why do they keep giving us

08:55.290 --> 08:57.891
these frickin' hash browns for breakfast?

08:57.893 --> 09:00.827
They shouldn't be giving us
frozen... like, real crap.

09:00.829 --> 09:01.928
Hey.

09:01.930 --> 09:03.297
I thought you got out.

09:03.298 --> 09:06.233
Didn't you hear? Calista
and I are co-conspirators.

09:06.234 --> 09:07.968
Oh, shoot.

09:07.969 --> 09:09.502
- Tough break.
- Yeah.

09:09.504 --> 09:10.470
Well...

09:10.472 --> 09:12.405
hey. Don't cry.

09:12.407 --> 09:13.806
Not in the yard.

09:13.809 --> 09:15.943
Tears to a mean girl's
like blood to a shark.

09:17.012 --> 09:18.044
Listen.

09:21.249 --> 09:22.782
You think you J.Lo, bitch?

09:22.784 --> 09:23.884
Oh, God.

09:23.885 --> 09:26.686
How you gonna go to fashion week now?!

09:28.323 --> 09:29.923
Is she coming over here?

09:31.460 --> 09:34.261
Joss. Uh... I see you've made friends.

09:34.262 --> 09:35.140
Just say the word.

09:35.141 --> 09:36.664
She's a big girl. She can talk for herself.

09:36.665 --> 09:37.898
I have nothing to say to you.

09:37.899 --> 09:40.201
Joss, can I just speak
to you in private, please?

09:40.202 --> 09:41.334
Don't you dare touch me.

09:41.336 --> 09:42.535
Come on.

09:42.537 --> 09:44.504
You heard her, Project Runway.

09:46.000 --> 09:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:01.890 --> 10:03.791
There are experimental trials.

10:03.792 --> 10:08.028
The N.I.H. does miraculous
stuff in this field.

10:08.029 --> 10:11.331
In the meantime, we'll search
for a new platelet donor.

10:11.333 --> 10:14.568
Oh, come on, Karen. It took
us three years to find you.

10:14.569 --> 10:17.671
Well, with me, Dr. Jenkins,
and Alec on the case,

10:17.672 --> 10:20.273
there's no way we're not
going to make this better.

10:21.276 --> 10:22.743
But you heard what she said.

10:22.744 --> 10:24.678
We need to minimize the stress on your body

10:24.679 --> 10:26.546
and check you into the hospital tonight.

10:26.548 --> 10:27.715
I'm not going in tonight.

10:27.716 --> 10:30.316
Well, Alec will insist.

10:31.453 --> 10:33.853
He doesn't know that I'm sick.

10:35.157 --> 10:36.757
What the hell's going on?

10:36.758 --> 10:38.559
He's receiving his
physician of the year award

10:38.560 --> 10:40.794
from the American Society of Cardiology,

10:40.795 --> 10:43.296
and there is a black-tie
gala tomorrow night.

10:44.299 --> 10:45.465
While he'd never admit it,

10:45.467 --> 10:47.434
this award means the world to him.

10:47.435 --> 10:48.434
Vivian...

10:48.436 --> 10:49.537
you know him.

10:49.538 --> 10:51.971
If I tell him now, he'll...

10:51.973 --> 10:55.508
Blow off the award and
jump into savior mode.

10:55.510 --> 10:57.343
I'd never forgive myself.

10:57.345 --> 10:58.946
He won't forgive you for not telling him.

10:58.947 --> 11:00.480
I will. I will.

11:00.482 --> 11:01.681
After tomorrow.

11:01.683 --> 11:04.817
Vivian I don't know that...

11:04.819 --> 11:07.987
It is a lifetime of his work being honored.

11:07.989 --> 11:09.188
Karen...

11:09.191 --> 11:10.857
Let him have this moment.

11:13.028 --> 11:14.827
Do you love me?

11:16.097 --> 11:17.297
You know that I do.

11:17.299 --> 11:20.199
Then let me have one
last night of happiness

11:20.202 --> 11:22.402
before...

11:22.404 --> 11:25.071
I go into that hospital...

11:25.073 --> 11:27.307
maybe for good.

11:28.610 --> 11:31.477
I'm begging you, Karen.

11:31.479 --> 11:33.212
Please.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.685
Thanks for coming.

11:46.656 --> 11:48.523
Oh!

11:48.525 --> 11:50.827
Marc. Why are you here?

11:50.828 --> 11:52.561
Well, I heard about Joss, and, uh,

11:52.563 --> 11:54.430
well, despite all that
stupid stuff I said last week

11:54.432 --> 11:56.232
about surviving on the
inside, I found this website

11:56.233 --> 11:58.935
where actual inmates said what
really helped them the most

11:58.936 --> 12:02.172
was having some of their favorite
magazines and books around...

12:02.173 --> 12:04.607
a juicy novel or two to
get their mind off things,

12:04.608 --> 12:07.443
and I figured that you'd
be seeing her soon, so...

12:07.445 --> 12:09.044
You're a good man, Marc.

12:10.247 --> 12:12.815
Uh, hey, uh... Do you know the Griswolds?

12:12.817 --> 12:13.569
What?

12:13.570 --> 12:15.051
They're playing the
Troubadour next Saturday,

12:15.052 --> 12:17.487
and I thought maybe...
If you'd... want to go?

12:17.488 --> 12:20.222
Oh, okay. That sounds like fun.

12:20.224 --> 12:21.957
A little distraction might be nice.

12:21.959 --> 12:23.193
Okay.

12:23.194 --> 12:25.727
So, it'll just be, uh, you and me...

12:25.730 --> 12:27.997
Together at a show.

12:27.998 --> 12:30.467
You want to invite more
people, that's fine.

12:31.469 --> 12:32.468
Oh. Oh.

12:34.872 --> 12:38.041
Oh, that's weird. It's Dana from next door.

12:38.042 --> 12:39.341
Hello?

12:40.511 --> 12:42.979
I'll be right there. Thanks.

12:42.980 --> 12:45.080
There's a strange man in our backyard.

12:46.317 --> 12:47.316
I'll drive.

12:47.318 --> 12:49.451
I'll be back.

12:49.453 --> 12:51.488
Okay, this all looks
terrific, Phil. Thanks, mate.

12:51.489 --> 12:53.590
Oh, wait... and if we're
running low on the hamachi,

12:53.591 --> 12:55.057
do the ceviche as a special, okay?

12:55.059 --> 12:56.693
I got it under control.

12:56.694 --> 12:58.160
You go see Joss.

12:58.162 --> 13:00.095
And don't give this place a second thought.

13:00.931 --> 13:03.099
Harry Davis, I've been trying
to reach you all morning.

13:03.100 --> 13:05.068
Sorry. I've been a bit, uh, preoccupied.

13:05.069 --> 13:06.703
I'm actually just on my way out.

13:06.704 --> 13:08.204
This will just take a sec.

13:08.205 --> 13:10.707
I got you a meeting with Dispirito.

13:11.776 --> 13:12.975
- Rocco?
- Yeah.

13:12.977 --> 13:13.910
The Rocco Dispirito?

13:13.911 --> 13:15.412
He's choosing two
up-and-coming chefs

13:15.413 --> 13:17.080
to develop a cookbook and web series with,

13:17.081 --> 13:19.015
and I got you on the short list.

13:20.684 --> 13:22.584
Not the reaction I was expecting.

13:23.587 --> 13:25.188
Look, I don't need a hug,

13:25.189 --> 13:27.490
but a grunt of gratitude would be nice.

13:27.491 --> 13:30.026
Yeah. No, of course. Thank you.

13:30.027 --> 13:32.561
This is about the kiss. Damn frickin' kiss.

13:32.563 --> 13:33.730
No. No, no, no.

13:33.731 --> 13:35.131
I-I-it threw me for like
10 minutes, but it's...

13:35.132 --> 13:36.798
- I made it weird.
- It's fine.

13:36.801 --> 13:37.934
No, it's not.

13:37.935 --> 13:40.236
Look, it was an impulse.
I don't follow them often.

13:40.237 --> 13:42.372
And it's so okay you
don't feel the same way.

13:42.373 --> 13:43.807
Ari... you're uncomfortable.

13:43.808 --> 13:45.842
Maybe we should think about
transferring you to another agent.

13:45.843 --> 13:46.843
T-that is not necessary at...

13:46.844 --> 13:48.878
seriously, Harry, I believe in you

13:48.879 --> 13:51.381
and think you could be a
very important client for us.

13:51.382 --> 13:53.316
I don't want to do
anything to jeopardize that.

13:53.317 --> 13:55.285
I'll still cover the Dispirito meeting.

13:55.286 --> 13:57.387
Here's some articles to brush up on.

13:57.388 --> 13:58.755
Oh.

13:58.756 --> 13:59.655
We'll talk.

13:59.657 --> 14:00.522
Okay.

14:00.524 --> 14:02.090
This is Ari.

14:08.999 --> 14:10.232
We should call the police.

14:10.234 --> 14:12.234
Shh. Stay back.

14:12.236 --> 14:13.402
Hello?

14:14.805 --> 14:17.005
Lock's not busted. Everything's still here.

14:18.175 --> 14:19.908
I'll check the yard.

14:29.453 --> 14:30.253
Whoa!

14:30.254 --> 14:31.453
Whoa, buddy!

14:31.455 --> 14:32.689
Who the hell are you?!

14:32.690 --> 14:34.123
- He's with me!
- Yeah.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.991
- Miranda?
- Mom's home!

14:35.993 --> 14:37.960
Hey, little bro.

14:39.063 --> 14:40.095
Whew.

14:40.998 --> 14:42.031
How you doing?

14:42.032 --> 14:43.299
Fine. What are you doing here?

14:43.300 --> 14:45.935
Oh, well, we picked Scotty
up early from school.

14:45.936 --> 14:47.237
We used his key to get in.

14:47.238 --> 14:48.904
April, his room is adorable.

14:48.906 --> 14:50.006
Thank you.

14:50.007 --> 14:52.242
That's a, uh, great piece of grass

14:52.243 --> 14:53.443
you got back there, too.

14:53.444 --> 14:55.577
I see that you're not
suffering from the drought.

14:56.814 --> 14:57.981
I'm sorry... who are you?

14:57.982 --> 15:01.150
Oh! T-this is my boyfriend... Ron.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.453
Howdy. Ron Friedman.

15:03.454 --> 15:05.154
I've heard so much about you both.

15:05.155 --> 15:07.122
Wish I could say the same.

15:08.859 --> 15:10.226
You never mentioned him on the phone,

15:10.227 --> 15:12.495
and we... talked about a lot.

15:12.496 --> 15:15.398
Well we met a week ago on the cruise.

15:15.399 --> 15:18.535
Yeah, but it feels like we've
known each other for years.

15:18.536 --> 15:20.936
He was one of my highest rollers.

15:20.938 --> 15:22.238
And she, uh...

15:23.274 --> 15:24.607
...she was my lucky charm.

15:24.608 --> 15:25.674
Ohh.

15:25.676 --> 15:27.076
So, the ship is docked for a week.

15:27.077 --> 15:29.511
I thought I would come see my little man.

15:29.513 --> 15:31.013
Oh. She means Scotty.

15:31.015 --> 15:32.382
I...Got that.

15:32.383 --> 15:35.183
Well, I see you've
already found a snack, Ron.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.053
Why don't I make us all some iced tea?

15:37.054 --> 15:38.154
- Sure.
- Great.

15:38.155 --> 15:39.855
- That's great.
- Come on.

15:39.857 --> 15:41.991
Hey, it's me. I'm sorry
I didn't pick up earlier.

15:41.992 --> 15:44.360
I was at the doctor's with Vivian.

15:44.361 --> 15:45.994
Anyway, about Joss...

15:45.996 --> 15:48.697
I called David, and he was cagey with me.

15:48.699 --> 15:49.965
Do you know what's going on?

15:49.967 --> 15:53.770
I'm not on the roster to
see her until Thursday.

15:53.771 --> 15:55.671
I'd love to go together...

15:56.540 --> 15:58.573
uh...

15:58.576 --> 16:00.575
Call me back when you can, sweetie.

16:02.012 --> 16:02.944
Karen.

16:04.114 --> 16:05.180
Hi, Alec.

16:06.951 --> 16:07.949
Look...

16:09.253 --> 16:11.087
I-I would've called, but this isn't...

16:11.088 --> 16:12.755
The kind of thing you say on the phone.

16:12.756 --> 16:14.456
When you told me you were pregnant,

16:14.458 --> 16:15.757
I didn't react well.

16:17.061 --> 16:18.561
I was... well, my typical self

16:18.562 --> 16:20.263
when my better self was required.

16:20.264 --> 16:22.799
It was a lot to process in the moment.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.200
Really, it's...

16:24.201 --> 16:25.567
my father was a bastard.

16:27.738 --> 16:31.106
Distant, demanding, impossible to please.

16:31.108 --> 16:32.508
I'm a lot like him.

16:32.509 --> 16:34.776
Well, no, that... that doesn't mean

16:34.778 --> 16:36.813
that you'll be the same
kind of father he was.

16:36.814 --> 16:39.581
Well, with two moms like you and Vivian...

16:40.584 --> 16:42.617
...how bad could I screw the kid up?

16:42.620 --> 16:43.753
Alec, I don't... I don't...

16:43.754 --> 16:46.956
just... just say you're
open to talking about it...

16:46.957 --> 16:48.457
us helping you with the baby.

16:49.860 --> 16:51.194
Vivian's been trying to cover it,

16:51.195 --> 16:53.162
but she's been so sad lately.

16:53.163 --> 16:55.130
A-and I know it's because of this.

16:56.066 --> 16:57.265
Just think about it?

16:59.336 --> 17:00.802
Okay.

17:03.240 --> 17:06.007
Oh, uh, Karen?

17:06.010 --> 17:08.175
If you're free tomorrow night...

17:08.178 --> 17:11.413
Uh, I'm getting this
thing... silly A.S.C. Gala.

17:11.415 --> 17:14.281
Anyway, everyone I care
about will be there.

17:15.752 --> 17:17.719
Wouldn't feel right without you.

17:24.528 --> 17:26.762
Who wore it best?

17:26.763 --> 17:27.996
Not your skanky ass.

17:27.998 --> 17:29.732
- Look at this.
- Oh, that's nasty.

17:29.733 --> 17:31.666
That is wrong on so many different levels.

17:31.669 --> 17:32.634
Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh.

17:32.636 --> 17:33.969
- Hey, Blondie.
- Hey.

17:34.972 --> 17:36.772
You don't look so hot.

17:36.774 --> 17:37.974
Have a sucker.

17:37.975 --> 17:39.442
Thanks.

17:39.443 --> 17:40.783
Where'd you get all this stuff?

17:42.713 --> 17:44.146
Hey, uh...

17:46.450 --> 17:49.785
Hey, Roz, can I speak to Joss?

17:51.288 --> 17:52.187
Roz, no...

17:52.189 --> 17:53.789
Sorry, honey. I got a sweet tooth.

17:57.761 --> 17:59.696
Buying friends in prison...
why am I not shocked?

17:59.697 --> 18:01.097
Look, I just want to talk to you.

18:01.098 --> 18:02.165
Screw off, Calista.

18:02.166 --> 18:04.432
Look, I just... I want to talk to you.

18:04.435 --> 18:05.400
Whatever.

18:07.137 --> 18:08.504
- Whoa!
- Ohhh! Ohhh!

18:08.505 --> 18:09.872
You freakin' kidding me?!

18:09.873 --> 18:11.374
Been waiting to do that
for a long time now.

18:11.375 --> 18:13.275
You've been wanting to push me?

18:15.746 --> 18:17.779
Oh, hell no! Let's go.

18:18.782 --> 18:20.081
What? That's all you got?!

18:20.084 --> 18:22.150
Hey! Hey! Break it up!

18:22.152 --> 18:23.151
Carver!

18:25.322 --> 18:26.822
Break it up!

18:29.927 --> 18:32.761
Hey! Hey! Back it up!

18:48.369 --> 18:50.600
You can't put me in here with her.

18:50.601 --> 18:51.365
Thanks, Lisa.

18:59.043 --> 19:00.743
You planned this?

19:00.744 --> 19:03.645
I just needed to talk to you.

19:21.098 --> 19:23.099
You can't give her those, you know.

19:23.100 --> 19:25.134
The guard out there agreed I
could have them on the table

19:25.135 --> 19:26.769
while we talked... to just, you know,

19:26.770 --> 19:28.804
make it nice for her for a minute.

19:31.475 --> 19:32.675
Hey, she knows I'm here, right?

19:32.676 --> 19:33.809
She was called.

19:37.481 --> 19:39.616
Wait! Guard, please! Can you
put me in any other cell? Please?

19:39.617 --> 19:41.517
You can't change rooms.
This isn't the four seasons.

19:41.518 --> 19:42.918
You think this is funny?

19:42.920 --> 19:44.820
No. I think we're in deep.

19:44.822 --> 19:49.359
And I think the only people
that can help us get out is us.

19:49.360 --> 19:51.060
Forget about the lawyers

19:51.061 --> 19:53.395
and the police that can't
even find the frickin' gun.

19:53.397 --> 19:56.666
I think if you and I
put our heads together,

19:56.667 --> 19:59.434
we can figure out who might've killed him

19:59.436 --> 20:03.006
if we go over every detail of that night.

20:03.007 --> 20:05.041
Then maybe, uh, it will spark something.

20:05.042 --> 20:06.743
What... I just...

20:06.744 --> 20:09.379
how delusional are you, really?

20:09.380 --> 20:10.813
I'm not talking to you about anything.

20:10.814 --> 20:12.314
You're the reason that I'm in here.

20:12.316 --> 20:13.416
What did you tell them...

20:13.417 --> 20:15.250
that I was some murderous, psycho lesbian?

20:15.252 --> 20:16.119
Really?

20:16.120 --> 20:17.487
Joss, you came after me.

20:17.488 --> 20:18.688
You went after my past,

20:18.689 --> 20:20.890
trying to make it look like I was a killer.

20:20.891 --> 20:23.126
You had to know I would protect myself.

20:23.127 --> 20:25.528
And anyway, they had a case
against you long before that

20:25.529 --> 20:27.129
because you opened your mouth.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.968
I had no intention of hurting you... none.

20:31.969 --> 20:33.902
You were my closest friend.

20:34.938 --> 20:36.505
Look at me. You know me.

20:36.507 --> 20:38.039
No, you know what?

20:38.042 --> 20:40.677
You know what I know, Calista?

20:40.678 --> 20:43.912
I know that you are ruled
by blinding narcissism

20:43.914 --> 20:47.383
and selfishness and deceit.

20:47.384 --> 20:49.419
Do you realize that all the
people that are in your life

20:49.420 --> 20:52.021
are paid to be there... so that
you can have all the control?

20:52.022 --> 20:55.056
And you are incapable of real friendship.

20:55.059 --> 20:56.057
A-and you know what?

20:56.060 --> 20:58.693
I-I-I hope that you rot in hell.

21:00.631 --> 21:01.831
I didn't want to control you.

21:01.832 --> 21:03.732
I gave you that job
'cause I believed in you.

21:03.734 --> 21:05.300
That... that's it.

21:09.173 --> 21:12.274
And I-I wanted you close
because I really loved you.

21:15.112 --> 21:16.579
I-I'm sorry.

21:26.223 --> 21:27.422
Excuse me.

21:29.226 --> 21:30.625
Thank you, love.

21:30.627 --> 21:31.726
Karen.

21:32.730 --> 21:34.230
Oh. Hi.

21:34.231 --> 21:37.465
These are Alec's parents,
Judith and Arthur.

21:38.435 --> 21:39.869
Well, nice to meet you. I'm Karen.

21:39.870 --> 21:42.003
Karen? The Karen?

21:42.039 --> 21:43.572
Is this...

21:43.574 --> 21:45.607
Stem-cell Karen?

21:45.609 --> 21:46.942
Do not embarrass her, mom.

21:46.944 --> 21:48.778
May I give you a hug, dear?

21:48.779 --> 21:49.811
Mom.

21:53.784 --> 21:55.017
When Alec told me

21:55.018 --> 21:58.086
that he found some stranger
with the right blood,

21:58.088 --> 21:59.355
I just... I-I didn't think

21:59.356 --> 22:01.590
that stranger would want
to go through all of it.

22:02.659 --> 22:04.293
Well...

22:04.294 --> 22:05.927
All you have to do is meet her once,

22:05.929 --> 22:09.732
and you want to do anything.

22:09.733 --> 22:10.700
Thank you...

22:10.701 --> 22:12.602
So much.

22:12.603 --> 22:14.269
Well, I should go.

22:14.271 --> 22:15.670
Nice to meet you.

22:22.212 --> 22:24.646
Lucy conked out.

22:26.884 --> 22:28.083
You're stress-eating.

22:28.085 --> 22:29.851
Sure am.

22:29.853 --> 22:32.722
Your sister does that to me, too.

22:32.723 --> 22:34.791
Devoured an entire box of doughnuts

22:34.792 --> 22:37.360
the first time she showed up at my door.

22:37.361 --> 22:39.896
Medieval times ended at 8:00.
They should be home by now.

22:39.897 --> 22:41.230
I'm sure everything is fine.

22:41.231 --> 22:43.432
Ron probably just took
them out for dessert.

22:43.433 --> 22:45.101
Ron. What the hell is that?

22:45.102 --> 22:46.936
Bringing home some guy she just met

22:46.937 --> 22:48.770
when she's got a week
to spend with her son?

22:49.540 --> 22:50.807
What does she even see in him?

22:50.808 --> 22:52.542
Money?

22:52.543 --> 22:54.343
No, I'm sure she thinks he's got money,

22:54.344 --> 22:56.745
but I'll bet you my
R.V. That Rolex is fake.

22:57.681 --> 22:59.182
This is so Miranda.

22:59.183 --> 23:00.783
She only picks con men and deadbeats.

23:00.784 --> 23:01.716
No offense.

23:01.718 --> 23:03.051
Mm. None taken.

23:03.053 --> 23:04.687
Paul was a con man... and a deadbeat.

23:06.256 --> 23:07.790
Finally.

23:07.791 --> 23:09.458
Oh. We thought you'd be sleeping.

23:09.459 --> 23:11.294
He loved it... all the horses and...

23:11.295 --> 23:12.829
it's way past his bedtime.
You should've called.

23:12.830 --> 23:14.696
No one asked you to stay up.

23:14.698 --> 23:15.931
It's only a week.

23:17.167 --> 23:18.099
Maybe less.

23:20.704 --> 23:22.038
Oh, shoot.

23:22.039 --> 23:23.606
Did... did I do wrong?

23:23.607 --> 23:25.240
Um...

23:25.242 --> 23:26.541
I'll put Scotty to bed.

23:26.543 --> 23:28.109
Okay, buddy. Here we go.

23:33.283 --> 23:35.685
We were gonna tell you
after we told Scotty.

23:35.686 --> 23:37.352
Uh...

23:39.456 --> 23:41.324
Ron and I are gonna get married.

23:42.392 --> 23:44.192
She's gonna make me the
happiest man in Vegas.

23:45.195 --> 23:47.163
He's got a big house with a
pool that Scotty is gonna love.

23:47.164 --> 23:48.096
Yeah.

23:49.633 --> 23:51.433
So you're taking Scotty now.

23:51.435 --> 23:52.435
He's my son.

23:52.436 --> 23:54.370
What, are you crazy?

23:56.139 --> 23:57.974
- What is your deal?
- What is my deal?

23:57.975 --> 23:59.374
Uh, maybe we should sit down.

23:59.376 --> 24:00.776
When were you thinking you were leaving?

24:00.777 --> 24:03.244
I know that we are leaving
at the end of the week.

24:03.247 --> 24:04.980
Well, shouldn't Scotty finish
the school year at least?

24:04.982 --> 24:06.315
He is 7. He'll adjust.

24:06.316 --> 24:08.350
He's been doing really well here.

24:08.352 --> 24:10.653
With all due respect,
this is a family matter.

24:10.654 --> 24:13.989
Uh, okay, maybe we should
head back to the hotel, hon,

24:13.991 --> 24:15.790
and, uh, let everyone sleep on the info,

24:15.792 --> 24:17.726
and we can discuss it again in the morning.

24:17.728 --> 24:20.662
There is nothing to discuss.
I've already decided.

24:20.664 --> 24:22.031
This is what's right for my family.

24:22.032 --> 24:24.132
And if my brother can't be happy for me,

24:24.134 --> 24:25.667
then he can keep his mouth shut.

24:25.669 --> 24:27.470
Wow.

24:27.471 --> 24:29.537
I really don't get you, Marc.

24:29.539 --> 24:31.840
I mean, you should feel relieved.

24:31.842 --> 24:35.176
You... you can finally get
out of here, go anywhere.

24:35.178 --> 24:36.911
You're free.

24:36.914 --> 24:38.079
God.

25:04.043 --> 25:05.042
Hey.

25:05.044 --> 25:07.310
Hey. There she is. Hey, gorgeous.

25:07.313 --> 25:08.111
Yeah? Really?

25:08.113 --> 25:09.379
Yeah, really.

25:09.381 --> 25:11.682
Whew. This onesie... it's...
it's really your thing.

25:11.684 --> 25:13.017
- Great color.
- Yeah.

25:13.018 --> 25:15.820
You know how hard it is to
take your shirt off to pee?

25:18.324 --> 25:20.024
- Hi.
- Hey.

25:20.025 --> 25:22.660
Now a few orders of business.

25:22.661 --> 25:24.495
Um...

25:24.496 --> 25:26.764
Your mum's ship finally
docked in, uh, Finland.

25:26.765 --> 25:27.966
That's her number,

25:27.967 --> 25:29.834
and I haven't been able
to reach David, but...

25:29.835 --> 25:31.836
- Do we have to talk about this? I...
- No, I was just gonna say

25:31.837 --> 25:33.638
that I have complete faith in him.

25:33.639 --> 25:34.772
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:34.773 --> 25:37.574
I've looked into him,
and he's... he's good.

25:40.679 --> 25:41.912
I love you.

25:42.715 --> 25:44.614
I love you.

25:44.617 --> 25:47.017
Now... for my plans.

25:47.019 --> 25:48.653
Your... Really?

25:48.654 --> 25:51.789
Oh, yes, milady. I have
been up to some stuff.

25:51.790 --> 25:53.824
- Boom.
- What... what is this?

25:53.826 --> 25:55.192
My official offer on the house.

25:55.194 --> 25:56.494
What house?

25:56.495 --> 25:57.862
Your house, the house that you loved...

25:57.863 --> 26:00.465
our house in, you know, Fryman Canyon.

26:00.466 --> 26:02.867
Is this the one with the crap kitchen?

26:02.868 --> 26:04.168
Hey, what's a kitchen?

26:04.169 --> 26:05.637
What's a kitchen? You're a chef.

26:05.638 --> 26:07.704
Yeah, a chef with a meeting
with Rocco Dispirito.

26:08.374 --> 26:10.475
Yeah, I'm making inroads,
Joss. I am moving up.

26:10.476 --> 26:12.577
And we can afford to
do construction on this

26:12.578 --> 26:14.412
or any other house, for that matter.

26:14.413 --> 26:16.714
Oh, I-I don't know what to say, Harry.

26:16.715 --> 26:19.450
Say that you'll live with me
in the great house with the...

26:19.451 --> 26:21.252
Crap kitchen once you get
out, which will be soon,

26:21.253 --> 26:22.887
but I-I'm gonna wait
for you to decorate it

26:22.888 --> 26:24.589
because we both know I am terrible

26:24.590 --> 26:26.057
in the decorating department.

26:28.727 --> 26:30.328
Uh, yeah, I just...

26:30.329 --> 26:33.297
Should we really be talking
like this... about the future?

26:33.298 --> 26:34.332
I...

26:37.569 --> 26:38.703
Yeah, absolutely.

26:40.406 --> 26:41.438
Yeah.

26:48.614 --> 26:49.814
What am I looking at?

26:49.815 --> 26:52.283
A copy of the flight manifest
showing that Eva Petrov

26:52.284 --> 26:54.751
was en route to Rome during
the time of the murder.

26:54.753 --> 26:56.154
Great. Proves nothing.

26:56.155 --> 26:58.155
She could've had someone kill him.

26:58.157 --> 26:59.691
What about his other whores?

26:59.692 --> 27:01.659
Their alibis all checked out, too.

27:01.660 --> 27:03.528
- What about their husbands?
- Calista.

27:03.529 --> 27:05.797
And I suppose the rental-car search...

27:05.798 --> 27:06.664
nothing?

27:06.665 --> 27:07.632
I'm sorry.

27:07.633 --> 27:08.533
You're sorry.

27:08.534 --> 27:09.834
There's something else.

27:09.835 --> 27:11.802
Great. What?

27:14.840 --> 27:17.642
Josslyn's lawyer found
e-mails you wrote to Luca,

27:17.643 --> 27:19.576
saying you wanted to kill him.

27:20.579 --> 27:21.946
That's an expression, Patty.

27:21.947 --> 27:23.081
I've said that

27:23.082 --> 27:24.682
to I don't even know how many schmucks,

27:24.683 --> 27:26.350
that I wanted to kill them.

27:26.351 --> 27:28.352
Not a great defense. I'm sorry.

27:28.353 --> 27:31.289
You know what? Stop apologizing
and just do your job, okay?

27:31.290 --> 27:33.691
I assume you've kept me on as your attorney

27:33.692 --> 27:36.060
because of my experience
with criminal defense?

27:36.061 --> 27:37.128
Mm.

27:37.129 --> 27:40.231
It would behoove you to
trust that experience.

27:40.232 --> 27:42.632
Or this next move won't work.

27:44.570 --> 27:45.735
Fine. What?

27:47.506 --> 27:48.873
Well, I've come around to your idea.

27:48.874 --> 27:50.508
I think you should tell the police

27:50.509 --> 27:53.677
you and Joss had a plan to
set Luca up for the divorce.

27:53.679 --> 27:55.012
Finally.

27:55.013 --> 27:57.749
But then Joss went rogue
and murdered him instead.

27:57.750 --> 27:59.784
You freaked out, you fled the scene,

27:59.785 --> 28:01.619
which was what was caught on that video,

28:01.620 --> 28:03.788
and you lied about it
because it looked so bad.

28:03.789 --> 28:05.656
You'll still have to cop to obstruction,

28:05.657 --> 28:07.859
but that's only 3 to 5, versus 20 to life,

28:07.860 --> 28:09.926
and I will make sure that you get

28:09.928 --> 28:12.062
the Martha Stewart-style treatment.

28:13.599 --> 28:16.233
Deals are for fools and guilty people.

28:16.235 --> 28:18.569
They're for people with no better option,

28:18.570 --> 28:20.337
and that, dear, is you.

28:21.206 --> 28:23.106
I want my day in court.

28:23.108 --> 28:24.174
I want my day in court.

28:24.176 --> 28:25.676
You put me up on a stand,

28:25.677 --> 28:28.545
there's no jury that
will convict me of this.

28:29.515 --> 28:31.514
Get character witnesses.

28:32.885 --> 28:34.084
Who?

28:34.086 --> 28:37.789
I've gone to all your
"friends" in the business,

28:37.790 --> 28:40.324
asking them to speak up on your behalf,

28:40.325 --> 28:42.727
write a letter of support... anything.

28:42.728 --> 28:45.095
No one will touch this
with a 10-foot pole.

28:45.097 --> 28:46.964
And you can forget
anybody who worked for you.

28:46.965 --> 28:48.598
They're seen as coerced.

28:49.601 --> 28:52.068
So, tell me...

28:52.070 --> 28:54.871
Who is there?

29:04.116 --> 29:06.883
You should've seen him. He was so hopeful.

29:06.885 --> 29:10.453
He was... planning the
whole future, you know?

29:10.455 --> 29:12.190
He'd waste his whole life waiting for me.

29:12.191 --> 29:13.558
I'm telling you, he would, Roz.

29:13.559 --> 29:15.259
Well, if your lawyer was worth his spit,

29:15.260 --> 29:16.694
he should've brought you a deal.

29:16.695 --> 29:19.296
Yeah... 10 to 12 if I confess to the crime

29:19.298 --> 29:21.498
and say that Calista planned it.

29:21.500 --> 29:23.701
Oh, so, you're gonna take it?

29:23.702 --> 29:25.735
My lawyer says I definitely shouldn't.

29:25.737 --> 29:27.238
Well, it ain't his life on the line.

29:27.239 --> 29:29.040
What are you saying...
that I should confess

29:29.041 --> 29:30.408
to a crime that I didn't commit?

29:30.409 --> 29:31.976
I'd rot in here till I was like 40.

29:31.977 --> 29:34.210
Look, I'm just saying, think
about it for two seconds

29:34.213 --> 29:36.579
before you reject it out of hand.

29:36.582 --> 29:39.683
What happens if you lose
at trial? Worst-case?

29:39.685 --> 29:41.384
Well, life, but...

29:41.386 --> 29:44.622
That's one heavy roll of the dice, man.

29:44.623 --> 29:46.624
No, but David said we'd
appeal and appeal, you know?

29:46.625 --> 29:49.093
Okay. You see Keke over there?

29:49.094 --> 29:50.795
She was offered a plea and didn't take it.

29:50.796 --> 29:54.397
She swears from here to Sunday
she's innocent, just like you.

29:54.399 --> 29:55.867
She's been appealing for nine years,

29:55.868 --> 29:57.648
when the plea would've had her out in five.

29:58.971 --> 30:01.472
She missed her son's whole childhood.

30:01.473 --> 30:02.939
Sometimes you just take the plea

30:02.941 --> 30:04.874
because not taking it's worse.

30:12.384 --> 30:14.217
Hey. Where are the kids?

30:14.219 --> 30:15.919
Upstairs.

30:17.389 --> 30:18.656
What are you doing?

30:18.657 --> 30:21.591
Ronald Friedman's a surprisingly
popular name in Nevada.

30:23.495 --> 30:25.596
Aha. Here he is.

30:25.597 --> 30:27.317
With his Tommy Bahamas
and all of his chins.

30:29.768 --> 30:30.935
Oh, no.

30:30.936 --> 30:32.802
What? Does he have a record?

30:32.804 --> 30:34.304
From the Las Vegas Business Chronicle...

30:34.306 --> 30:35.373
"How Ron Friedman Became

30:35.374 --> 30:37.675
Las Vegas' Air-Conditioning Guru."

30:37.676 --> 30:40.677
He services 40% of the city's hotels?

30:41.713 --> 30:43.146
"The king of cool" is loaded.

30:44.416 --> 30:45.983
I'm missing something.

30:45.984 --> 30:47.385
Why is this... bad?

30:47.386 --> 30:49.487
Because now I know Miranda's
gonna go through with it...

30:49.488 --> 30:52.089
the wedding, moving Scotty.

30:52.090 --> 30:54.592
April, just... this
marriage is doomed to fail.

30:54.593 --> 30:55.826
Maybe she'll surprise us.

30:55.827 --> 30:58.528
Maybe Miranda can finally
turn things around.

30:59.665 --> 31:01.698
Look, I wouldn't want to marry Ron.

31:02.801 --> 31:04.601
But he seems nice enough.

31:04.603 --> 31:06.037
"Nice enough"?

31:06.038 --> 31:09.740
And he'll provide the security
that your sister clearly wants.

31:09.741 --> 31:12.643
I mean I understand her impulse.

31:12.644 --> 31:15.446
Uh, her impulse to what?

31:15.447 --> 31:18.182
To not struggle, not
worry, be taken care of.

31:18.183 --> 31:20.084
At what price?

31:20.085 --> 31:22.085
And to teach that to
Scotty... that it's okay

31:22.087 --> 31:23.953
to just marry some stranger for money?

31:23.956 --> 31:25.855
Come on.

31:25.857 --> 31:27.791
What about love?

31:29.027 --> 31:30.093
You know?

31:32.764 --> 31:35.166
I mean, she threatens to kill him

31:35.167 --> 31:36.599
in several e-mails.

31:36.601 --> 31:38.502
Here... And again right here.

31:38.503 --> 31:40.670
That's just the way Calista talks.

31:41.673 --> 31:43.107
Her defense will likely argue that,

31:43.108 --> 31:46.377
but the ability to use her own
words against her at a trial...

31:46.378 --> 31:47.678
that's a step in the right direction.

31:47.679 --> 31:49.513
The more doubt that we can cast on her...

31:49.514 --> 31:51.094
David, I want to talk about the deal.

31:52.784 --> 31:54.485
Uh, w-we took the deal off the table.

31:54.486 --> 31:56.053
No, you took the deal off the table

31:56.054 --> 31:58.422
before we could properly discuss it, so...

31:58.423 --> 31:59.690
I want you to level with me, okay?

31:59.691 --> 32:01.625
Not tell me what you
think I want to hear or...

32:01.626 --> 32:02.792
just the truth.

32:04.096 --> 32:06.530
If we reject this plea and we go to trial,

32:06.531 --> 32:08.164
what are my chances?

32:12.104 --> 32:14.537
The case against you is strong.

32:14.539 --> 32:16.674
And if it were anyone else...

32:16.675 --> 32:18.275
I would advise them to take the deal.

32:18.276 --> 32:19.442
So, why shouldn't I, then?

32:19.444 --> 32:20.478
Well, for one thing,

32:20.479 --> 32:23.114
you'll be quite compelling on the stand.

32:23.115 --> 32:25.483
You have a goodness, uh, likability,

32:25.484 --> 32:29.020
a... messy sort of innocence
that can't be taught.

32:29.021 --> 32:30.554
And I believe a jury will recognize

32:30.555 --> 32:32.255
you couldn't possibly have done this.

32:33.725 --> 32:34.592
That's it?

32:34.593 --> 32:36.192
Of course that's not it.

32:36.194 --> 32:38.062
They have no murder
weapon, but Calista has...

32:38.063 --> 32:39.963
I can't believe that we're
gonna throw all my chips down

32:39.965 --> 32:41.865
on... on, what, my "messy goodness"?

32:41.867 --> 32:43.099
- David, I...
- Joss, l-listen to me.

32:43.101 --> 32:44.634
You know what? No, stop. I'm sorry.

32:44.636 --> 32:47.237
I...I really... I need
to be realistic right now,

32:47.239 --> 32:48.538
okay, David?

32:48.540 --> 32:51.875
And I know that you have
killed yourself on this case,

32:51.877 --> 32:54.144
and I am so grateful, a-and... but...

32:54.146 --> 32:55.445
Look, despite your best intentions,

32:55.447 --> 32:56.913
I have just been given
the worst-case scenario

32:56.915 --> 32:58.248
time after time,

32:58.250 --> 33:01.151
and I really feel like if
things keep going this way

33:01.153 --> 33:05.722
and we reject the plea and
then we lose at trial...

33:05.724 --> 33:07.491
I'm gonna be in here
for the rest of my life.

33:07.492 --> 33:08.591
Do you understand that?

33:08.593 --> 33:10.126
If you lost, we would appeal, Joss.

33:11.296 --> 33:12.929
David, I would like you to take the deal.

33:12.931 --> 33:15.298
Joss... I am strenuously advising...

33:15.300 --> 33:16.466
David!

33:17.969 --> 33:19.769
Take the deal.

33:22.331 --> 33:23.098
Mom? Mom.

33:23.099 --> 33:24.666
Mom! M...

33:24.667 --> 33:28.471
No, mom, just tell dad
to hit "cancel ride."

33:28.472 --> 33:29.852
I told you I was picking you up.

33:34.378 --> 33:35.777
You look absolutely gorgeous.

33:35.779 --> 33:37.480
Thank you for coming.

33:37.481 --> 33:38.680
I wouldn't miss it.

33:39.683 --> 33:40.983
Vivian's in the bedroom.

33:40.984 --> 33:43.119
You think you could get her to hustle?

33:43.120 --> 33:45.921
Yeah, n-no, no, mom.
No, yeah, no, I'm here.

33:50.327 --> 33:51.761
Knock, knock.

33:51.762 --> 33:54.664
Aww. I knew you'd come.

33:54.665 --> 33:57.533
Did Alec tell you to hurry me along?

33:57.534 --> 33:59.801
We're not even close to being late.

34:03.207 --> 34:04.807
It won't stop shaking.

34:07.044 --> 34:08.978
May I?

34:13.583 --> 34:16.319
Last time we did this, it was under...

34:16.320 --> 34:18.821
Very different circumstances.

34:20.123 --> 34:22.456
I'm worried about the rash.

34:23.460 --> 34:25.327
I don't think the makeup's enough.

34:27.498 --> 34:28.864
What if Alec notices?

34:38.308 --> 34:42.476
That's the beauty of black...
it goes with everything.

34:42.478 --> 34:44.347
Thank you...

34:44.348 --> 34:46.414
for letting me have tonight.

34:47.717 --> 34:50.152
Now, let's finish you up...

34:50.154 --> 34:52.121
before Alec has a fit.

34:58.362 --> 35:00.762
And how about this room, huh?

35:00.764 --> 35:02.998
Yep. This is great.

35:06.036 --> 35:08.104
Wow. My girlfriend will love this view.

35:08.105 --> 35:10.006
I-I don't think she's seen it at night.

35:10.007 --> 35:12.141
Is that right? When's she
coming back from her trip?

35:12.142 --> 35:13.443
Hmm?

35:13.444 --> 35:15.344
Uh... yeah. I don't know.

35:15.345 --> 35:17.146
Every time she's set to come home,

35:17.147 --> 35:19.682
she finds another corner
of the globe she has to see.

35:19.683 --> 35:21.050
Wish I had the freedom to travel.

35:21.051 --> 35:22.952
And this converted garage
could be her office, you know?

35:22.953 --> 35:24.353
H-her business is only gonna grow,

35:24.354 --> 35:25.588
so she'll need her own space.

35:25.589 --> 35:27.155
And you... you said the seller's willing

35:27.157 --> 35:28.825
to put that wall back
up in the master, yeah?

35:28.826 --> 35:30.026
Oh, yeah.

35:30.027 --> 35:31.828
Great, 'cause Joss will
definitely want a second bedroom

35:31.829 --> 35:33.529
up there for guests.

35:33.530 --> 35:35.463
And maybe a baby someday, hmm?

35:37.067 --> 35:39.569
Oh. I-I-I'm sorry. That was...

35:39.570 --> 35:42.338
- It's all right...
- I know eventually, she, um...

35:42.339 --> 35:43.606
Yeah, she wants to be a mother.

35:43.607 --> 35:45.274
Then maybe she'd better get back to you

35:45.275 --> 35:47.210
and get started, then, huh?

35:47.211 --> 35:49.210
You never know how long
these things can take.

35:49.947 --> 35:51.948
Gosh, you know, I envy you...

35:51.949 --> 35:53.848
just at the beginning of things.

35:53.851 --> 35:56.251
Two people planning a life,

35:56.253 --> 35:57.887
all the time in the world.

35:59.189 --> 35:59.989
Oh.

35:59.990 --> 36:01.891
Sorry.

36:01.892 --> 36:03.325
Hello?

36:09.733 --> 36:11.200
You want to talk? Let's talk.

36:11.201 --> 36:12.735
Would you like, uh, some coffee?

36:12.736 --> 36:13.836
No, I'm fine.

36:13.837 --> 36:15.203
Marc, what's this about?

36:16.406 --> 36:18.306
It's about Scotty.

36:18.308 --> 36:19.442
I already told you...

36:19.443 --> 36:21.777
Please... just let me say this.

36:21.778 --> 36:23.646
I think you should reconsider

36:23.647 --> 36:25.281
and let Scotty finish the school year here.

36:25.282 --> 36:26.349
I can look after him.

36:26.350 --> 36:28.284
They're more than welcome
to keep living here.

36:28.285 --> 36:30.353
And this way, you can
give the whole Vegas thing

36:30.354 --> 36:32.587
a test run before you
move Scotty out there.

36:32.589 --> 36:33.890
Oh, a test run?

36:33.891 --> 36:36.292
So you don't think Ron
and I are gonna last.

36:36.293 --> 36:38.633
I... think that you and Ron
don't really know each other.

36:39.563 --> 36:41.430
Well, I don't care what you think.

36:41.431 --> 36:43.533
What about what Scotty thinks?

36:43.534 --> 36:45.301
'Cause I know for a fact he's happy here.

36:45.302 --> 36:47.102
He's bonded with his teacher, Mrs. Watson,

36:47.104 --> 36:48.504
and he's getting great reports,

36:48.505 --> 36:49.872
and he's got a little
best buddy down the street,

36:49.873 --> 36:50.905
and he plays with him every day.

36:50.908 --> 36:52.174
And he's got you for a good-time pal?

36:52.175 --> 36:53.842
He has real roots here.

36:53.844 --> 36:55.144
Oh. Says the mobile-home moocher.

36:55.145 --> 36:56.445
I mean, when was the last time

36:56.446 --> 36:59.080
you stayed anywhere for
more than four months?

36:59.082 --> 37:00.750
What do you know about roots?

37:00.751 --> 37:01.850
Let alone parenting.

37:01.852 --> 37:03.152
He knows a lot, Miranda.

37:03.153 --> 37:05.454
He has been a father to
Scotty... a great one.

37:05.455 --> 37:07.323
Just please stay out of this, April.

37:07.324 --> 37:09.992
This is my house, and I'm talking.

37:09.993 --> 37:11.693
He reads to Scotty every night.

37:11.695 --> 37:13.930
He makes his breakfast every morning.

37:13.931 --> 37:15.731
He packs his lunches
with cute, little notes

37:15.732 --> 37:17.132
to remind him that he's loved.

37:17.134 --> 37:18.968
He bathes him. He dresses him.

37:18.969 --> 37:20.703
He takes him to the zoo every weekend.

37:20.704 --> 37:22.371
He takes him to school every morning.

37:22.372 --> 37:23.706
He moves his schedule around

37:23.707 --> 37:25.573
so that he can be here
when Scotty gets home.

37:25.576 --> 37:27.342
Your brother has stepped up.

37:29.646 --> 37:30.879
Is that right?

37:30.881 --> 37:32.180
Yeah.

37:33.784 --> 37:35.585
Was he stepping up

37:35.586 --> 37:37.787
when he fell off the wagon two weeks ago?

37:37.788 --> 37:39.320
What?

37:49.266 --> 37:50.298
Wow.

38:04.982 --> 38:07.215
Hi, mom. It's me.

38:08.251 --> 38:09.517
Hi.

38:10.487 --> 38:12.454
Oh, no, no, mom, please don't cry,

38:12.456 --> 38:14.556
because then I'll cry, and
there's really no reason to.

38:14.558 --> 38:15.825
No, I'm okay.

38:15.826 --> 38:18.027
Oh, yeah, yeah, I have...
I have an excellent lawyer.

38:18.028 --> 38:19.961
Mm-hmm.

38:19.963 --> 38:22.097
No, I haven't heard from Savi.

38:24.334 --> 38:26.701
Yeah, I-I'm sure she will, too. Yeah.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.773
I love you, too.

38:30.774 --> 38:33.809
Uh, l-listen, mom, I um...

38:33.810 --> 38:37.846
I just need to talk to you because I, uh...

38:37.848 --> 38:41.250
I made a decision, and...
and I need you to, um...

38:41.251 --> 38:42.551
J-just be supportive and...

38:42.552 --> 38:45.321
because I know you probably
won't understand, okay?

38:45.322 --> 38:47.223
I'm gonna be in here for a while, mom.

39:03.006 --> 39:04.707
Only 20 minutes left on the Carver deal.

39:04.708 --> 39:06.776
Do you want me to get Santos
on the phone to accept?

39:11.848 --> 39:12.982
Limo's here!

39:23.960 --> 39:26.227
You are so beautiful.

39:27.564 --> 39:28.696
Do you have your speech?

39:28.699 --> 39:29.964
Right here.

39:29.966 --> 39:31.566
- Your throat lozenges?
- I got those, too.

39:31.568 --> 39:32.500
Reading glasses?

39:34.404 --> 39:35.637
Yes. All good.

39:35.639 --> 39:37.539
Have everything.

39:37.541 --> 39:40.176
Okay. Well, let's go.

39:40.177 --> 39:41.476
In a minute.

39:53.190 --> 39:55.057
Vivian!

39:55.058 --> 39:56.325
Call 911!

39:56.326 --> 39:57.125
Vivian!

40:04.901 --> 40:06.434
My friend just collapsed.

40:28.825 --> 40:30.425
District attorney?

40:30.427 --> 40:32.927
Please... begin.

40:32.929 --> 40:34.996
State your name.

40:34.998 --> 40:37.332
Calista Raines.

40:37.334 --> 40:39.434
And confirm for the record

40:39.436 --> 40:41.102
that you are willfully speaking to me

40:41.104 --> 40:43.171
without your attorney present.

40:43.173 --> 40:44.606
That's correct.

40:46.176 --> 40:48.243
All right, Ms. Raines.

40:49.713 --> 40:51.813
How would you like to
revise your statement?

40:51.815 --> 40:54.215
Uh...

40:54.217 --> 40:55.884
I-I killed my husband alone.

40:59.589 --> 41:01.689
Josslyn Carver had nothing to do with it.
