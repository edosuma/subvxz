(soft music playing)

00:58.133 --> 00:58.900
(sighs)

00:58.967 --> 01:01.900
Blanche, I thought you
were on a date with Jerry.

01:01.967 --> 01:05.066
So did I. He let me out
at the movie theater,

01:05.133 --> 01:09.133
said he would park the car,
I never saw him again.

01:09.533 --> 01:11.133
You've been ditched.

01:11.200 --> 01:15.333
If I want advice on getting ditched,
I'll ask an expert.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.100
Dorothy, did I get ditched?

01:17.867 --> 01:21.700
Yes, but don't feel bad.
Look what it's done for Sonny Bono.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.734
It's happened.
I cannot believe it.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.834
I've lost it, haven't I?

01:27.900 --> 01:30.367
In more back seats
than any woman I know.

01:31.667 --> 01:34.066
Ma, you're not feeling any better,
are you?

01:34.133 --> 01:37.200
-I'm fine. Thank you.
-You look terrible.

01:37.266 --> 01:41.500
Gee, I guess I won't be in the
sports illustrated swimsuit issue

01:41.567 --> 01:43.867
like the rest of you.

01:43.934 --> 01:46.934
(laughs) Sophia, Dorothy's
just concerned about your health.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.100
We all are.

01:48.166 --> 01:50.600
You have been sick for over a week.

01:50.667 --> 01:57.100
You should obey the doctor's orders.
If you don't, I'll call him

01:57.166 --> 01:58.200
and tell on you.

01:58.266 --> 02:01.233
Oh, what's he going to do,
come over and spank me?

02:01.633 --> 02:04.734
If he does,
tell him to come by my room.

02:06.100 --> 02:08.066
(doorbell rings)

02:08.633 --> 02:10.133
Who can that be?

02:10.200 --> 02:13.400
-Maybe it's Blanche's date.
-Oh, he better not show up here.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.867
I'll get it.

02:20.133 --> 02:21.834
-Hi, everyone. It's me, Stan.
-(exhales)

02:21.900 --> 02:25.800
Look, I know it's late,
but I have awesome news.

02:25.867 --> 02:29.667
-Dating someone over 12?
-(laughs)

02:29.734 --> 02:32.367
Ma, that's not nice.
Is that it, Stanley?

02:33.100 --> 02:36.467
No. Congratulate me, everyone.
I'm getting hitched.

02:36.533 --> 02:38.300
Oh, that's wonderful!

02:38.367 --> 02:41.333
-Well, congratulations, Stan.
-Tell us about it.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.467
(clears throat) Her name's Katherine.
We met at the post office.

02:44.533 --> 02:46.333
We discovered
we had a lot in common.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.200
Oh, is she bald, too?

02:50.166 --> 02:51.633
For the first few months,

02:51.700 --> 02:55.400
I found myself sending her flowers,
candy, friendship notes

02:55.467 --> 02:56.767
for no special reason.

02:56.834 --> 02:59.166
That's lovely, Stan. I'm impressed.

02:59.233 --> 03:03.033
I read in a book by some Dame Shrink
that chicks really eat that stuff up.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.133
(laughs)

03:04.200 --> 03:06.934
Katherine and I fell in love

03:07.000 --> 03:09.433
and decided to get married.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.433
The wedding's a week from tonight,
and you're all invited.

03:12.500 --> 03:15.834
(laughs) I talked to the kids.
They're going to try and fly in.

03:15.900 --> 03:20.200
I got to go now. I'm on my way
to surprise Katherine with this.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.567
What do you think?

03:23.633 --> 03:26.767
I think Lisa Bonet spent more
on the ring in her nose.

03:28.500 --> 03:31.767
It's beautiful.
Katherine will love it.

03:31.834 --> 03:33.834
-You mean it?
-Not a word.

03:34.633 --> 03:37.166
It's a real diamond.
What's wrong with it?

03:37.233 --> 03:40.500
The more appropriate question is,
where is it?

03:41.533 --> 03:44.033
Ok, the diamond's not very big.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.834
Ok, it's not a real diamond.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.600
It's the thought that counts.

03:51.133 --> 03:53.233
Ok, I didn't put much thought into it.

03:53.300 --> 03:56.200
It was cheap. I'm cheap.

03:56.266 --> 04:00.133
Let me help you pick out
something else for Katherine.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.166
-Me, too.
-My taste is ok.

04:03.233 --> 04:05.600
You've seen that ring
I picked for Dorothy.

04:05.667 --> 04:11.266
Actually, he was going for a bracelet,
but the mechanical claw grabbed the ring.

04:14.734 --> 04:17.233
Ok, girls,
I guess I do need some help.

04:17.300 --> 04:20.066
Tomorrow we'll set up
a time for shopping.

04:20.133 --> 04:21.467
I really have to run.

04:21.533 --> 04:24.600
I'm fixing a terrific supper
for Katherine.

04:24.667 --> 04:29.500
In 38 years of marriage, you never
once cooked us a terrific meal.

04:30.066 --> 04:33.467
-Neither did you.
-(nodding)

04:37.200 --> 04:41.066
(soft music playing)

04:41.133 --> 04:44.467
Ma, I thought you were supposed
to be taking it easy.

04:44.533 --> 04:47.066
When I feel bad,
I have to take my mind off it.

04:47.133 --> 04:48.767
There is only one thing
that does that for me.

04:48.834 --> 04:50.033
Cooking a big meal.

04:50.100 --> 04:51.767
No, making love in a closet.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.867
But, hey, you do what you can.

04:56.333 --> 04:58.100
-Hi, we're back.
-Ah...

04:58.166 --> 05:00.166
We helped Stan pick a ring
for Katherine.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.467
I think we spent too much.

05:02.533 --> 05:06.467
Oh, stop worrying about the money.
We're talking about love.

05:06.533 --> 05:09.467
-Still, we spent too much.
-You didn't spend it.

05:09.533 --> 05:13.433
The yutz spent it.
That's what makes him a yutz.

05:13.834 --> 05:16.400
Sophia's right.
Don't worry about it.

05:16.467 --> 05:17.533
(coughing)

05:18.000 --> 05:20.266
Ma, Ma, I think you better sit down.

05:20.333 --> 05:25.000
-Come on. Over here. Here you go.
-(coughing)

05:25.066 --> 05:27.467
Dorothy, should I get Sophia
a glass of water?

05:27.533 --> 05:31.433
No, Rose. You should sit here
and watch her hack herself to death.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.133
Are you sure?

05:34.200 --> 05:37.934
-Get the water!
-(Rose) Oh! Sorry.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.767
I'm going to call the doctor.

05:39.834 --> 05:41.000
I can't breathe.

05:41.066 --> 05:42.867
Forget the doctor!
Call the paramedics!

05:42.934 --> 05:44.100
(coughing)

05:45.567 --> 05:47.133
(tense music playing)

05:47.200 --> 05:49.333
(ambulance siren wailing)

05:49.800 --> 05:52.233
What is taking them so long?

05:52.300 --> 05:54.567
I'm sure they're doing their best.

05:54.633 --> 05:57.900
Cafeteria's closed.
This is all I could find.

05:57.967 --> 06:00.867
-Thanks, honey.
-Any word on Sophia?

06:00.934 --> 06:03.033
-None.
-(sighs)

06:03.100 --> 06:05.066
Oh, I hate waiting.

06:05.133 --> 06:07.467
Oh, I hate hospitals.

06:07.533 --> 06:11.600
I hate when people put each other down
on love connection.

06:15.033 --> 06:17.400
I came as fast as I could.

06:17.467 --> 06:18.900
How'd you know where to find us?

06:18.967 --> 06:21.633
I had second thoughts
about the ring's price,

06:21.700 --> 06:23.066
so I came by the house.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.400
The neighbors told me.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.934
-I'm so happy you're cheap.
-(both laughing)

06:27.000 --> 06:29.100
-How's Sophia?
-We still don't know.

06:29.166 --> 06:30.900
Oh, Stan, I'm scared.

06:30.967 --> 06:32.266
(Dr. Seymour)
Mrs. Zbornak?

06:32.333 --> 06:36.133
Oh, Dr. Seymour,
will my mother be all right?

06:36.200 --> 06:37.967
Her condition is quite serious.

06:38.033 --> 06:39.900
But you said it was just a simple virus.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.633
It's advanced to pneumonia.

06:41.700 --> 06:45.000
Normally, I wouldn't worry,
but her resistance is low.

06:45.066 --> 06:48.600
That, plus her age,
makes these next hours critical.

06:48.667 --> 06:50.433
You mean she could die?

06:50.500 --> 06:52.166
We're doing everything possible.

06:52.233 --> 06:55.033
We'll see how she responds.

06:55.100 --> 06:57.900
-Can I see her?
-After she leaves intensive care.

06:57.967 --> 07:00.967
You should go home
and get some rest.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.500
I'll call if there's any change.

07:03.567 --> 07:05.600
I'll take you home.

07:05.667 --> 07:06.467
No. I'm not leaving.

07:06.533 --> 07:08.266
-We'll stay.
-You go.

07:08.333 --> 07:09.700
Oh, we're staying.

07:09.767 --> 07:12.133
I would rather be alone. Please.

07:12.200 --> 07:13.633
-Are you sure, babe?
-(nods)

07:13.700 --> 07:15.266
(exhales)

07:16.734 --> 07:19.166
Would it be stupid to ask
for a group hug before we leave?

07:19.233 --> 07:23.667
Oh, of course not, honey.
(chuckles)

07:23.734 --> 07:26.433
Hands above the waist, Stanley.

07:35.567 --> 07:37.400
Hi, babe. I hope you're hungry.

07:37.467 --> 07:38.900
I sent you home.

07:38.967 --> 07:41.867
-Ah, I was in the neighborhood.
-At 1:00 A.M.?

07:41.934 --> 07:45.266
I kept thinking about Sophia.
How is she?

07:45.333 --> 07:48.667
(sighs)
No one's said a word to me in hours.

07:48.734 --> 07:50.900
What? That's ridiculous.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.533
I'm going to find somebody right now.
Ah, excuse me.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.000
Ah, I want some information,
and I want it now.

07:57.066 --> 08:00.700
-The John is down the hall.
-Yeah...

08:01.166 --> 08:04.533
It's about a patient, Sophia Petrillo.
She's in intensive care.

08:04.600 --> 08:08.300
-Ah, the cafeteria is closed.
-Wait.

08:09.266 --> 08:11.000
Get a doctor in here.

08:11.066 --> 08:12.834
Someone will be here
in just a moment.

08:16.266 --> 08:18.066
You really care about ma,
don't you?

08:18.133 --> 08:20.500
(chuckles)
Someone puts you down for 40 years,

08:20.567 --> 08:22.967
-you have a special bond.
-(chuckles)

08:23.033 --> 08:28.300
I can't imagine life without her
telling me what a yutz I am,

08:28.367 --> 08:30.900
how my toupee looks
like a monkey's behind.

08:30.967 --> 08:32.033
(chuckles)

08:32.100 --> 08:34.867
-God, I love that woman.
-I do, too.

08:35.934 --> 08:38.433
Ah, what if she doesn't make it?

08:38.500 --> 08:40.734
She's going to be fine.

08:40.800 --> 08:42.600
Come on, let's eat.

08:42.667 --> 08:43.834
I brought you your favorite.

08:43.900 --> 08:46.533
Oh, you're such a sweetheart.
Chinese.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.533
No, Italian.
(clears throat)

08:52.600 --> 08:55.633
Look, there's been no change
on the Petrillo case.

08:55.700 --> 08:58.266
We're very busy.
We'll call when we can.

08:58.333 --> 09:01.667
Listen. Sophia may be
just another case to you,

09:01.734 --> 09:03.100
but we love her.

09:03.166 --> 09:04.967
We want to know
how she is regardless.

09:05.033 --> 09:09.033
I want information
every hour on the hour.

09:09.100 --> 09:12.500
I'm sorry, sir.
I'll see that you're kept informed.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.200
(laughs) You were magnificent.

09:17.266 --> 09:18.867
I have my moments.

09:18.934 --> 09:22.367
(claps) What do you want?
Lasagna or cannelloni?

09:22.433 --> 09:26.000
Ma makes great lasagna.
I can never get mine to taste as good.

09:26.066 --> 09:30.900
She says it's because I don't sing
to my marinara sauce.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.200
She sings opera to her sauce
except during the holidays,

09:35.266 --> 09:37.900
then she sings Nat King Cole.

09:39.667 --> 09:41.300
(crying)

09:42.834 --> 09:44.734
I love your lasagna.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.633
You're saying that
to make me feel better.

09:46.700 --> 09:48.200
Is it working?

09:51.033 --> 09:52.233
Like a charm.

09:53.700 --> 09:55.967
(soft music playing)

10:12.066 --> 10:18.800
Excuse me. Mrs. Zbornak?
Oh, my mother?

10:18.867 --> 10:20.500
-She's going to be fine.
-Oh.

10:20.567 --> 10:23.333
-You can see her right away.
-(laughs) Thank you.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.967
Oh, she's going to be all right.

10:27.033 --> 10:28.667
Stanley, let's go see her.

10:28.734 --> 10:30.166
No, no, no. You go.

10:30.233 --> 10:31.333
You two should be alone.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.533
I'll stop by later.

10:33.600 --> 10:37.567
Stan, thank you for standing by me.

10:37.633 --> 10:40.133
I don't know
how I could've done it without you.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.367
Hey, what are ex-husbands for?
(chuckles)

10:45.166 --> 10:48.100
(mellow music playing)

10:56.900 --> 10:58.800
(beeping)

11:06.233 --> 11:08.867
(laughs)
Oh, Ma, you scared me to death.

11:09.834 --> 11:12.033
You scared me to death.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.767
You couldn't put on a little makeup?
There could be a single doctor.

11:17.467 --> 11:22.000
I'd like to know you're taken care of,
or at least getting a little on the side.

11:23.166 --> 11:26.133
The doctor says you'll be fine.

11:26.200 --> 11:29.633
Of course I am.
I survived war, disease,

11:29.700 --> 11:32.567
and two seasons of designing women.

11:35.066 --> 11:36.000
Hey.

11:36.066 --> 11:37.467
Hello, Sophia.

11:37.533 --> 11:41.800
We stopped by on our way to work.
How are you feeling?

11:41.867 --> 11:43.100
She'll be just fine.

11:43.166 --> 11:47.033
Only this time,
she'll follow the doctor's orders.

11:47.100 --> 11:50.333
You must be exhausted
being here alone all night.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.500
I wasn't alone.

11:51.567 --> 11:55.800
Stan stayed with me,
brought me food, held me,

11:55.867 --> 11:58.767
showed me that
special part of himself.

11:59.233 --> 12:01.200
Right there in the waiting room?

12:09.734 --> 12:11.867
Not that part, Rose.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.133
Spending time with Stan

12:16.200 --> 12:18.600
made me see something that
I hadn't realized.

12:18.667 --> 12:22.300
He dyes the hairs in his ears?
I knew that.

12:22.700 --> 12:27.600
Besides that.
I'm still in love with the man.

12:27.667 --> 12:30.834
I can't let him marry someone else.

12:32.133 --> 12:35.133
Is it me, or is the room
suddenly getting darker?

12:41.200 --> 12:44.166
(serene music playing)

12:54.467 --> 12:57.900
-(Rose) Hurry up, Blanche.
-Rose, stop pulling on my nightie.

12:57.967 --> 13:01.233
It's got one more yank
before it falls apart.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.934
I'm saving that for Henry Barnsworth.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.433
Shh. I just don't want Dorothy to hear.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.967
We can't let Dorothy ruin
Stan and Katherine's wedding.

13:12.033 --> 13:13.767
It's selfish, it's adolescent,

13:13.834 --> 13:16.333
and it will put a cramp
in their honeymoon.

13:16.400 --> 13:21.200
-Rose...
-Dorothy's acting like a real goober.

13:21.266 --> 13:24.133
-(Blanche) Rose...
-I'd say that to her face.

13:24.200 --> 13:29.433
Of course,
I'd have to stand on a chair. (laughs)

13:33.433 --> 13:35.100
It's her, isn't it?

13:37.400 --> 13:41.000
Don't be mad at Rose.
She's saying what she feels.

13:41.066 --> 13:44.800
And you think I'm terrible
for wanting my husband back?

13:44.867 --> 13:46.600
Ex-husband, Dorothy.

13:46.667 --> 13:50.000
Ex-husband who left you,
and didn't have the courtesy

13:50.066 --> 13:51.633
to tell you he was leaving.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.800
Ex-husband who married
somebody half your age

13:54.867 --> 13:57.000
just one week after the divorce.

13:57.066 --> 14:00.166
Ex-husband who's getting
married again tomorrow.

14:00.233 --> 14:03.867
He's treated you like dirt.

14:03.934 --> 14:07.266
Even that I could overlook,
if he had a good body.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.500
I appreciate what you're trying to do,

14:11.567 --> 14:16.033
but I love Stanley.
I want to be with him,

14:16.100 --> 14:18.333
and I'm very sorry about Katherine.

14:18.400 --> 14:21.133
What is suddenly so wonderful
about Stanley?

14:21.200 --> 14:26.367
Everything. Just everything.
He has grown, he has changed.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.734
You should have seen how he took over
when ma was sick.

14:29.800 --> 14:35.967
He was so commanding, so masterful,
and yet so sensitive and vulnerable.

14:36.033 --> 14:37.834
I couldn't have gotten
through it without him.

14:37.900 --> 14:41.400
Listen, Dorothy,
you thought Sophia might be dying.

14:41.467 --> 14:44.367
You were the one who was vulnerable.

14:44.433 --> 14:45.900
Blanche is right.

14:45.967 --> 14:49.700
At the counseling center,
I always see cases like this.

14:49.767 --> 14:51.100
When people lose loved ones,

14:51.166 --> 14:54.033
they sometimes do things
they'd never normally do.

14:54.100 --> 14:55.600
Take Mrs. Palawskie.

14:55.667 --> 14:59.900
When her mother died,
she divorced her husband, lost 30 pounds,

14:59.967 --> 15:02.367
dyed her hair,
and ran off to Paris

15:02.433 --> 15:04.800
with an artist 10 years younger.

15:04.867 --> 15:06.567
I just got a postcard.

15:06.633 --> 15:09.500
Yeah, now she's miserable
and bony

15:09.567 --> 15:11.867
and sick of eating snails, right?

15:11.934 --> 15:14.133
No, they bought a beautiful home.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.300
Rose!

15:15.767 --> 15:18.667
Granted, not a great example.

15:18.734 --> 15:21.066
Thank you for proving my case,
Rose.

15:21.133 --> 15:25.767
Ma getting sick made me
see how great Stan is.

15:25.834 --> 15:28.867
What if this isn't
what Stanley wants?

15:28.934 --> 15:30.867
Excellent point.
What about that?

15:30.934 --> 15:36.000
If you had been there, you'd know
he feels the same about me.

15:36.066 --> 15:39.667
Then how come
he hasn't called off his wedding?

15:39.734 --> 15:43.066
Because he is not sure how I feel.

15:43.133 --> 15:46.200
He wants me to make the first move.

15:46.266 --> 15:50.066
I hadn't counted on this.
She makes good sense.

15:50.133 --> 15:51.433
Rose!

15:52.133 --> 15:55.667
Thank you for helping me
think this through.

15:55.734 --> 15:58.333
Up until now,
I honestly had a few doubts.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.700
After talking to you,
I know what I'll do.

16:01.767 --> 16:06.934
Tomorrow, before the wedding,
I'm going to tell Stan I love him.

16:09.900 --> 16:15.633
Way to go. You talked her into doing
the opposite of what we wanted.

16:15.700 --> 16:19.133
I guess that's why they took me off
the suicide hotline.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.700
(knocking at door)

16:29.767 --> 16:31.266
Coming.

16:34.900 --> 16:38.533
-Hi.
-Hi. (laughs)

16:38.600 --> 16:40.767
-Can I come in?
-Sure.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.533
(laughs)

16:44.000 --> 16:47.333
Do I look like a man who's about
to do it for the third time?

16:47.400 --> 16:49.233
Get married, I mean.
(laughs)

16:50.166 --> 16:53.300
Very handsome.
Have you lost weight?

16:53.367 --> 16:54.700
No, I'm wearing a girdle.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.333
Is Sophia going to make it to the wedding?

16:57.400 --> 16:59.967
She's not quite up to it
but she sends her regards.

17:00.033 --> 17:02.467
And baggies for me
to bring back hors d'oeuvres.

17:02.533 --> 17:03.700
You're wearing a girdle?

17:03.767 --> 17:05.900
Yeah, and padded shoulders.
Is my head sweating.

17:05.967 --> 17:09.934
No. Um, Stan, the reason I came--

17:10.000 --> 17:11.367
(knocking at door)

17:13.367 --> 17:15.300
-Is the wedding still on?
-Why not?

17:15.367 --> 17:16.734
(laughs) He's right, why not?

17:16.800 --> 17:19.834
Dorothy, let's powder our noses
before the ceremony.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.867
I have to get something off my chest.

17:21.934 --> 17:25.567
I agree.
There, that's much better.

17:27.667 --> 17:30.734
-Ok, let's go.
-I'm not going anywhere!

17:30.800 --> 17:32.800
Would you girls excuse me?

17:32.867 --> 17:34.867
My girdle is killing me.

17:34.934 --> 17:37.500
-A girdle?
-And padded shoulders.

17:37.567 --> 17:39.867
And knowing him,
a sock in his crotch.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.433
What are you two doing here?

17:49.500 --> 17:51.500
Stopping you from making
a fool of yourself.

17:51.567 --> 17:54.033
Why would Dorothy do that?

17:54.100 --> 17:56.867
Well, you know
how she gets at weddings.

17:56.934 --> 18:00.600
Emotional, her nose starts running,
her mascara starts running.

18:00.667 --> 18:04.266
Pretty soon everything's running together,
and nobody can enjoy their cake.

18:05.633 --> 18:09.433
-I have to tell you something.
-Somebody's at the door.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.734
-I'll get it.
-Let Dorothy do this.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.600
But I'm closer, ow!
My ankle!

18:14.667 --> 18:18.700
Must be that old plow injury.
Dorothy, get the door.

18:24.700 --> 18:26.500
Dorothy wanted some air.

18:26.567 --> 18:29.200
-(knocking at door)
-Why is she knocking?

18:29.266 --> 18:33.900
That button's coming off.
We'd better go sew it on.

18:35.533 --> 18:36.800
(exhales)

18:38.066 --> 18:40.133
Bartender, give me another.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.967
Come on, lady,
you don't need another.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.100
-Why not?
-You've had three already.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.600
I said give me another.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.734
Fine, it's your life.

18:48.800 --> 18:51.133
Just don't blame me if you get sick.

18:59.133 --> 19:02.200
-Excuse me, is this seat taken?
-No. Help yourself.

19:02.266 --> 19:05.133
-Thanks.
-What can I get you?

19:05.200 --> 19:07.266
A shot of self-confidence.

19:07.333 --> 19:10.500
Let me guess.
You didn't come here to drink.

19:10.567 --> 19:13.667
You got a problem.
You need to talk.

19:13.734 --> 19:14.934
That's right.

19:14.967 --> 19:18.100
Then call a shrink.
This ain't cheers.

19:22.033 --> 19:23.266
(sighs)

19:23.333 --> 19:26.900
-Are you ok?
-Ah, just a little nervous.

19:26.967 --> 19:31.433
I'm supposed to get married
in exactly 20 minutes, here in this hotel.

19:31.500 --> 19:34.500
What are you doing here?
Cold feet?

19:34.567 --> 19:36.066
Yeah, but not about him.

19:36.734 --> 19:40.333
See, he's got this ex-wife.
(laughs)

19:41.166 --> 19:44.967
Better be careful what you say.
I happen to be an ex-wife.

19:45.033 --> 19:48.467
Not like his, I'm sure.
No one's like her.

19:48.533 --> 19:52.133
She's superwoman.
She was the perfect wife.

19:52.200 --> 19:55.066
Cooked, cleaned, had two kids,

19:55.133 --> 19:56.600
got an education,

19:56.667 --> 19:59.100
has never looked better,
and now has a career.

19:59.166 --> 20:02.800
That wasn't a marriage.
That's a commercial for a mini-pad.

20:08.066 --> 20:11.800
Her name is Dorothy,
and she's coming to our wedding.

20:11.867 --> 20:14.734
They're still friends.
Listen to me.

20:14.800 --> 20:18.000
I'm so intimidated by a woman
I've never met.

20:18.066 --> 20:22.834
That's understandable.
I mean, she sounds pretty terrific.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.166
I bet she's gorgeous, too.

20:26.567 --> 20:31.700
No, the daughter had her mother's nose.
It was a honker.

20:31.767 --> 20:34.266
(coughing)

20:35.333 --> 20:40.133
-Are you all right?
-(coughing)

20:40.200 --> 20:43.367
I'm fine.
You were saying?

20:43.433 --> 20:45.433
I don't know what I'm saying.

20:45.900 --> 20:50.467
I've waited all my life for someone
like Stan. That's my fiancé.

20:50.533 --> 20:51.533
-I know.
-You do?

20:51.600 --> 20:54.467
I know how you feel.

20:54.533 --> 20:58.967
No, you don't.
See, I've never been married before,

20:59.033 --> 21:00.734
except to my career.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.867
I feel so insecure about being a wife.

21:03.934 --> 21:05.533
I want to be a good wife.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.633
You're really crazy about him.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.166
Head over heels in love.

21:10.233 --> 21:12.600
I feel like a teenager.

21:12.667 --> 21:14.667
He's smart, he's funny,

21:15.700 --> 21:18.300
and the best lover I've ever had.

21:18.700 --> 21:21.100
You haven't slept around much,
have you?

21:25.467 --> 21:27.300
I beg your pardon?

21:27.700 --> 21:30.900
-Um, nothing. Popcorn?
-Oh, no. No, thanks.

21:32.367 --> 21:36.767
So you think he might still
be in love with his ex-wife?

21:36.834 --> 21:41.000
They're still good friends.
He talks about her all the time.

21:41.066 --> 21:45.633
Dorothy this, Dorothy that.
What if she wants him back?

21:45.700 --> 21:48.867
Oh, if she's as great
as you say she is,

21:48.934 --> 21:54.533
and no doubt she is, she might think
she wants him back.

21:54.600 --> 21:57.700
But maybe she'd think
of the two of you together

21:57.767 --> 22:00.633
and what a nice person you seem to be

22:00.700 --> 22:05.000
and how much you love each other and...

22:07.300 --> 22:11.400
I think she'd realize that
her time with him was over.

22:12.300 --> 22:15.333
She'd let go graciously
and wish him well.

22:16.333 --> 22:20.200
In fact, I think that's exactly
what she'd do.

22:21.367 --> 22:23.000
-No, she wouldn't.
-She would.

22:23.066 --> 22:25.567
-She wouldn't.
-She would. You sure?

22:25.633 --> 22:28.300
I'm a Leo.
We're very sure of ourselves.

22:29.633 --> 22:33.633
Well, it looks like
I've got a wedding to go to.

22:33.700 --> 22:36.166
I'm going to a wedding myself.
Mind if I walk with you?

22:36.233 --> 22:39.700
Not at all. You're very wise.
What did you say your name was?

22:39.767 --> 22:40.700
-I didn't.
-(laughs)

22:40.767 --> 22:44.467
I really enjoyed talking with you.
I hope we meet again soon.

22:44.533 --> 22:46.967
-Believe me, we will.
-(laughs)

22:47.033 --> 22:50.934
(soft music playing)

22:53.400 --> 22:56.567
(theme music playing)
