00:05.839 --> 00:09.110
<i>Previously on</i> Fire Country...
<i>Your friend Freddy</i>

00:09.210 --> 00:10.278
really did take a bum plea deal.

00:10.378 --> 00:11.579
You looked into his case?

00:11.679 --> 00:13.013
Is there any hope?
I'll have to work some

00:13.114 --> 00:14.082
jailhouse lawyer magic.

00:14.182 --> 00:15.883
There is no glamour in my job.

00:15.983 --> 00:18.186
I don't scare easily, Manny.
I know you don't.

00:18.286 --> 00:19.620
Stop by Three Rock next week.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.222
We're gonna work on ourselves

00:21.322 --> 00:22.990
so that by the end
of your sentence,

00:23.091 --> 00:24.325
we'll be good.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.927
You're tense.
You know, we could

00:27.027 --> 00:28.629
work through that together.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.231
Maybe in the woods later?

00:30.331 --> 00:31.599
Is this about
Cap's daughter again?

00:31.699 --> 00:33.134
Did you make it official
or something?

00:33.234 --> 00:34.302
Not till I parole.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.869
<i>I got you something.</i>

00:35.969 --> 00:37.871
Music costs
a pretty penny in here.

00:37.971 --> 00:40.174
It's nothing for
a friend in need.

00:40.274 --> 00:41.909
Something's up with my dad.
I can't get

00:42.009 --> 00:44.212
an honest answer out of him,
he keeps dodging me,

00:44.312 --> 00:45.646
and he lost the house.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.448
He borrowed money from us. <i>Dad,</i>

00:47.548 --> 00:49.117
are you gambling?
Yes.

00:49.217 --> 00:50.884
Mom, I'm a match
to donate my kidney.

00:50.984 --> 00:54.388
I'm a match. Pick me. Let me
be Sharon's kidney donor.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.224
So, if my mom's
still okay with it,

00:56.324 --> 00:57.491
you should be her donor.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.860
Sharon, I got approved
for the transplant.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.862
I'm gonna get a kidney.

01:12.706 --> 01:15.643
Bode, stop! Stop!

01:15.743 --> 01:17.345
Bode.

01:18.379 --> 01:20.013
Stop, Bode.

01:21.749 --> 01:24.418
I came as soon as I heard.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.926
We lost her.

01:35.163 --> 01:37.398
She's gone.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.935
I'm so sorry, Bode.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.974
I acknowledge
that I may die

01:47.074 --> 01:51.712
in the process or after
a kidney transplant.

01:51.812 --> 01:55.916
I also acknowledge that
I may die donating a kidney.

01:56.016 --> 01:58.786
I understand
that a pimpled intern

01:58.886 --> 02:01.355
might remove the wrong organ

02:01.455 --> 02:03.090
and I will not sue.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.858
Don't sue them, okay, Vince?

02:04.958 --> 02:07.628
Yeah. No suing. Copy that.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.163
You got anything else
fun in yours?

02:09.263 --> 02:12.099
Yeah, I consented to them
recording the surgery.

02:12.200 --> 02:15.169
I'm gonna put on some makeup.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.606
You understand this is...

02:18.706 --> 02:21.108
serious surgery, right?

02:21.209 --> 02:23.611
Anesthesia, risks.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.112
She's ignoring that part.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.680
And I've seen my son more

02:26.780 --> 02:29.717
on edge over the Niners
giving away the Super Bowl.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.152
Let's just have a toast
to the medical marvel

02:32.253 --> 02:34.121
of organ transplants.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.993
Thanks to Jakey.

02:40.093 --> 02:42.296
I mean, I thank you, but,
really, I'm just gonna owe you

02:42.396 --> 02:43.964
for the rest of my life.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.375
Oh!

02:54.475 --> 02:56.109
Oh!
Easy, boys.

02:56.210 --> 02:59.146
I'm not looking to make
any infirmary trips today.

02:59.247 --> 03:01.181
Hear you, boss.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.751
What are you working on?

03:03.851 --> 03:06.053
Put in a furlough request

03:06.153 --> 03:08.822
last week to see my mom
in the hospital.

03:08.922 --> 03:11.792
C.O. says I have to resubmit.

03:11.892 --> 03:14.395
Let me guess.
It was incomplete?

03:14.495 --> 03:17.631
They always say
that. May I?

03:21.469 --> 03:22.970
Yup.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.838
You gonna, uh,

03:24.938 --> 03:27.608
get back your license
to practice once you get out?

03:27.708 --> 03:29.610
That's pretty hard to do.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.312
You know,
I'm just not interested

03:31.412 --> 03:32.813
in corporate law anymore.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.315
You know, I can't help
these white collar crooks

03:34.415 --> 03:35.816
get off scot-free
after seeing

03:35.916 --> 03:37.518
what people get
for minor offenses.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.253
Or Freddy,
who didn't even do it.

03:39.353 --> 03:42.590
Right? Okay. And...

03:42.690 --> 03:44.692
this is gonna cost you
some new tunes.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.494
I never worked pro bono.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.962
But you're gonna need
your cap's sign-off.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.431
Uh, Cap's out.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.165
During his regular schedule?

03:52.266 --> 03:53.801
Mm.
That's weird.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.803
Well, then, you're gonna need
your C.O.'s approval.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.638
Yeah. Good luck with that, man.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.973
The new C.O. denied me
seeing my baby girl.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.542
Heartless.

04:01.642 --> 04:02.876
Yeah.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.145
Playtime's over, inmates.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.547
Let's hit the buggies.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.115
Let's go.

04:09.883 --> 04:13.287
You know, not all C.O.s
play by the rules.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.222
I'd stay on his good side today.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.924
Later.

04:23.531 --> 04:26.199
You call that hustle?

04:26.300 --> 04:28.536
I've seen snails
move faster than you.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.038
Let's go!

04:31.138 --> 04:33.741
Good morning.
I was expecting Captain Perez.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.409
I don't think we've met.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.878
Shiloh Cashen.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.681
I'm gonna need a signature
for this cargo.

04:42.182 --> 04:43.951
Uh, what is this?

04:44.051 --> 04:46.954
It's a loan agreement.
Perez is out.

04:47.054 --> 04:49.657
I'm lending you this inmate crew
for the day for your...

04:49.757 --> 04:51.659
Uh, reforestation project.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.461
Yeah, that's right.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.796
Okay. Um...

04:55.896 --> 04:57.798
so, does that mean
I'm flying solo today?

04:57.898 --> 05:00.300
Yup. All right, then.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.703
You're officially
in charge of Three Rock

05:02.803 --> 05:04.738
and Black Creek,
the women's camp.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.640
It's your lucky day.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.141
I am all for a field trip,

05:08.241 --> 05:09.810
but what exactly
are we doing out here?

05:09.910 --> 05:11.345
Looks like gardening.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.146
Eve's been planning
on doing this for a long time.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.649
She got these bull pines
donated from a retailer.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.818
Got us on loan so we
can help plant 'em.

05:18.619 --> 05:19.553
It's a good thing.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.221
Yeah, maybe for her career.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.723
Sure, yeah.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.292
Proving I can lead a crew
is good for my career, but

05:25.393 --> 05:26.794
I'm not doing it for me.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.629
I'm doing it for the hills,
and I'm doing it for y'all.

05:28.729 --> 05:31.532
A few months ago, we had a fire

05:31.632 --> 05:33.634
that burned hundreds
of trees around here.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.870
That's because the local sheriff
didn't want inmate crews around.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.072
Fire raged an extra week.

05:39.172 --> 05:43.076
Yeah. He was prejudiced
against fire camps.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.979
Which, again,
is why y'all are here.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.616
To cover up
his mistakes.
It's too late for that.

05:48.716 --> 05:51.385
No, to win hearts and minds.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.020
When y'all leave fire camp,

05:53.120 --> 05:55.789
whether you want
to join Cal Fire or not,

05:55.889 --> 05:57.858
I'm here to show people
what I see:

05:57.958 --> 06:01.529
extraordinary firefighters
who've served their community.

06:01.629 --> 06:05.232
All right. People are hard
to hate from close up.

06:05.332 --> 06:06.734
Exactly.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.603
All right, everybody,
we're doing a three-mile hike.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.104
Y'all ready?

06:11.204 --> 06:13.206
I think I'm gonna hang back,

06:13.306 --> 06:14.241
rest my legs.

06:14.341 --> 06:15.709
Rest your legs
from what?

06:15.809 --> 06:17.678
Something funny, inmate?

06:17.778 --> 06:19.012
Three Rock,

06:19.112 --> 06:21.682
Black Creek, you're with me.
Let's go.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.754
Come on, pick up the pace.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.958
Hey, you've reached Manny Perez.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.093
Uh, please leave your name
and your number...

06:33.193 --> 06:35.763
Oh. Hey, who pissed you off?

06:35.863 --> 06:37.531
'Cause I actually know a guy.

06:37.631 --> 06:41.702
Hmm. I afraid I can't stomach
hiring a hit man for my father.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.537
Captain Perez?
What'd he do?

06:43.637 --> 06:45.238
He took the day off,

06:45.338 --> 06:48.776
Which is not a good sign because
he doesn't believe in days off.

06:48.876 --> 06:51.445
And he's been
super unreliable recently,

06:51.545 --> 06:53.246
especially with money.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.749
Okay, well, I get it,
'cause my grandma--

06:55.849 --> 06:57.851
she's always falling
for Internet scams,

06:57.951 --> 07:00.353
and she's wiring money
to strangers, and...

07:01.154 --> 07:04.024
You're worried
he's making a bad decision.

07:04.124 --> 07:06.594
I'm worried he's gambling

07:06.694 --> 07:08.929
when he promised he'd get help.

07:12.332 --> 07:14.434
So, can we

07:14.535 --> 07:17.070
talk about this DNR thing?

07:17.170 --> 07:19.306
You don't want
to be resuscitated?

07:19.406 --> 07:22.142
Can we not? Because
I'm about to get a kidney.

07:22.242 --> 07:26.346
And then we are gonna go
on that road trip to Yosemite

07:26.446 --> 07:28.181
that we always put off.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.986
DNRs are for...

07:33.086 --> 07:36.724
super old, way sicker
than you people.

07:36.824 --> 07:39.059
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, but then

07:39.159 --> 07:41.495
I watched my father
sit on a vent.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.731
Uh, kept his body alive

07:43.831 --> 07:46.534
long after his spirit
was already gone.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.502
Yeah.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.672
That was excruciating to watch, Share,

07:51.772 --> 07:53.741
but this is different.

07:53.841 --> 07:56.510
Yeah, it is, because I'm not

07:56.610 --> 07:58.979
going out that way. I'm...

08:00.347 --> 08:02.516
I'm not leaving you
with the responsibility

08:02.616 --> 08:04.552
of pulling a plug on me.

08:04.652 --> 08:07.487
I'm... not sorry.

08:07.588 --> 08:08.889
Station 42.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.591
Hand stuck in a bait chopper.

08:10.691 --> 08:13.994
Imperial Harbor cross
from 7th Street, dock space 3.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.996
Okay, there it is.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.532
Go worry about that
poor soul.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.568
Not me.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.603
I'm not going anywhere.

08:22.703 --> 08:25.172
Actually, you are,

08:25.272 --> 08:27.307
because you're making me
nervous, and Lilly says

08:27.407 --> 08:29.777
that people who are nervous
have worse outcomes.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.713
So, the surgery's not for hours.

08:32.813 --> 08:35.849
And you can be of service.

08:35.949 --> 08:38.886
And then come back to me.

08:44.925 --> 08:48.395
Uh, please leave your name and
your number after the beep,

08:48.495 --> 08:50.598
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

08:50.698 --> 08:53.233
This is my fourth call, Dad.

08:53.333 --> 08:56.737
And-and you know what?
I... I'm over it. Uh...

08:56.837 --> 08:58.972
if you are gambling...
And you

08:59.072 --> 09:01.474
swore to me that
you would be getting help,

09:01.575 --> 09:02.810
and I believed you.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.778
At a certain point,
I'm-I'm...

09:04.878 --> 09:07.581
I'm out.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.116
Here she comes.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.018
You might
want to hang up now, Gab.
You know what?

09:11.118 --> 09:13.253
It might be more painful

09:13.353 --> 09:15.255
to have you in my life
than out of it.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.991
Gab. Gab. Gab!

09:18.792 --> 09:21.294
Isn't that...

09:23.764 --> 09:26.033
My dad?

09:26.133 --> 09:28.135
What's your dad
doing on a fishing boat?

09:28.235 --> 09:29.502
Oh.

09:29.603 --> 09:32.205
Not... gambling.

09:36.176 --> 09:39.847
Ooh! No more leg day
before gardening.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.514
We're almost there, y'all.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.050
You said that an hour ago.

09:43.150 --> 09:45.653
I will get you
to your mom's surgery.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.120
What, are you worried?

09:47.220 --> 09:49.723
Try wrecked.
Well, me too.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.659
Jake's acting all weirdly chill.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.493
You know how he is.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.295
He's all closed off.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.297
You know, it's gonna take more
than reforesting

09:57.397 --> 09:59.900
a remote location
to change the way people see us.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.702
Hey, are you trying
to get written up?

10:01.802 --> 10:03.536
I hate false promises.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.372
And you're a lawyer, right?
Hey, yeah.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.174
A lawyer who said
she'd look into my case.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.642
What's the latest there?

10:09.777 --> 10:11.211
What's that?

10:12.145 --> 10:13.346
Eve, watch out!

10:21.154 --> 10:23.824
Eve! Eve, can you hear me?

10:40.007 --> 10:41.441
Eve, can you hear me?
How did that tree fall?

10:41.541 --> 10:43.076
Eve?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.079
Hey, hey, sh... hey, shut up.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.514
Everyone, quiet. Quiet.

10:47.614 --> 10:49.817
Eve?
She's down there somewhere.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.685
Where? I don't see her.

10:51.785 --> 10:54.021
Yeah. Come on.
Grab your stuff. Let's go.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.488
I don't want a tree
to take me out.

10:55.588 --> 10:56.890
Okay, okay.
What?

10:56.990 --> 10:58.358
Uh, hey, hey, hey,
the newbie has a point.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.160
That is not a snag.

11:00.260 --> 11:03.030
What-Whatever fell a live tree
could come down on us down too.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.565
No. Uh...

11:05.665 --> 11:07.901
Eve's out here right now
trying to do right by us.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.636
All we've done
is sit here and grumble.

11:09.737 --> 11:12.139
Now we return the favor.
She's your friend.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.673
You go.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.977
Today, she's also my captain.
And yours.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.411
I'll stick with Manny,
thank you.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.947
Cap's not here right now, is he?

11:20.047 --> 11:22.149
Look, right now,
we're Eve's crew, okay?

11:22.249 --> 11:23.650
It's up to us.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.452
Great. It's up to me?

11:25.552 --> 11:27.254
I'm heading down to the buggy
before they send me

11:27.354 --> 11:28.889
to Lompoc for attempted escape.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.824
Whoa.
I can't go back to prison.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.192
Yeah.
Me too.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.593
Right now, somebody's life
might be on the line.

11:33.693 --> 11:34.995
You guys are just-just
gonna walk away?

11:35.095 --> 11:36.864
What kind of a person are you?
All right.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.665
There's no need to get all
<i>Lord of the Flies,</i> boys.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.100
Beck, if you leave the crew,

11:40.200 --> 11:41.802
that looks like you're
trying to escape.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.436
And if someone follows,

11:43.536 --> 11:45.605
that's considered conspiracy.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.112
Any of that true?

11:53.480 --> 11:56.083
Thank you.
I'm here!

11:56.183 --> 11:57.650
Can you hear me?

11:57.751 --> 11:59.219
Yeah! Eve, Eve!

11:59.319 --> 12:00.788
We can hear you!
We got you!

12:00.888 --> 12:02.389
Where the hell is Manny?

12:02.489 --> 12:04.758
Not here.
We're on our own.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.962
Help me stabilize his arm.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.167
I'm Captain Baha.
Chief Leone. What happened?

12:14.267 --> 12:17.070
Bait chopper gets hungry every
now and then is what happened.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.139
Safety officer tried
to warn him.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.273
That's him there.

12:21.274 --> 12:24.211
Yeah, Perez,
let Cal Fire do their job.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.148
Uh, actually, we could

12:28.248 --> 12:30.717
use the extra pair of hands
if you can spare him.

12:30.818 --> 12:33.753
Maybe you and your crew could,
uh, give us a little room?

12:36.456 --> 12:38.225
Manny, what do you know?

12:38.325 --> 12:39.759
His name's Alberto.
He was trying

12:39.860 --> 12:41.161
to scoop out some lodged bait.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.030
Got his glove caught
in the spinning blade.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.232
I hit the emergency shutdown,
but his hand's still jammed.

12:45.332 --> 12:46.499
All right. Vitals?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.701
His pulse is racing.
He's tachycardic.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.237
All right, we need
to keep him calm.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.805
The more upset he gets,
the more he's gonna bleed.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.573
Okay, sir, I need you

12:53.673 --> 12:55.475
to breathe with me slowly, okay?

12:55.575 --> 12:57.210
<i>Mija,</i> he doesn't speak English.

12:58.045 --> 13:01.014
Okay.

13:01.114 --> 13:01.815
Okay?

13:14.194 --> 13:15.829
Okay, respirations
are stabilized.

13:15.929 --> 13:19.132
Good. All right, we'll make sure
the power is secure.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.734
We'll see if we can
reverse the blades manually,

13:21.835 --> 13:24.204
get his hand out.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.977
What are you doing
on a fishing boat, Dad?

13:30.077 --> 13:31.912
You're a Cal Fire captain.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.446
And then you have this guy
talking to you

13:33.546 --> 13:34.781
like you're just some deckhand?

13:34.882 --> 13:36.483
Yeah, well,
today I'm a safety officer.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.386
I know I raised you better than
to look down on honest work.

13:44.191 --> 13:47.527
Hey, Eve. Eve.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.262
Eve, we're here.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.564
Get me out of here, fast.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.733
My... my breathing's labored.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.768
Rohan?
Airway is patent.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.404
No signs of retractions.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.838
Chest rise is even.

13:58.939 --> 13:59.873
Oh, you must be the doctor.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.143
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, Eve.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.245
Don't move, don't move. Don't
move. This tree's not stable.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.114
Uh, I'll stay still.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.716
But you got to make sure
you get a good anchor point.

14:09.816 --> 14:11.584
Make sure
it's bomb-proof.

14:11.684 --> 14:12.986
I have rope in my pack.

14:13.086 --> 14:16.023
Okay.
Uh, hey, find something

14:16.123 --> 14:18.191
that we can-we can
brace up this trunk with.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.626
'Cause if-if this tree
falls, it...

14:19.726 --> 14:20.894
It's gonna crush me.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.231
We won't let it.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.366
Okay. Call this in.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.002
Keep it aboveboard,
get back up there.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.939
I don't want you getting
in trouble for me.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.840
Do you see her radio?

14:33.941 --> 14:37.610
Uh, it-it can't be far.
I'll find it.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.247
Freddy, Freddy, hey,
get some Pulaskis.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.115
We need to create
an access point.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.251
We got to-we got to go slow.
If anything moves, we stop.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.885
Got it, B.

14:48.755 --> 14:51.158
We got you. Okay.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.996
Your eighth-grade
zip-lining trip.

14:56.096 --> 15:00.267
Okay, Mom, can we not
do this, please?

15:00.367 --> 15:01.701
You picked the place.

15:01.801 --> 15:03.570
You wanted to go first.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.772
And then you got scared

15:05.872 --> 15:09.009
on the first leg
and refused to go any further.

15:09.109 --> 15:13.513
Honey, look,
you talk a big game, okay?

15:13.613 --> 15:16.283
And I know that heroism
runs in this family, but...

15:16.383 --> 15:19.419
Hey, this isn't
zip-lining, though.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.489
Oh, good, you know that.

15:23.490 --> 15:25.492
'Cause...

15:26.293 --> 15:29.562
...you are acting like
this is a walk in the park.

15:29.662 --> 15:32.365
And it's not that,
and it's not zip-lining, either.

15:32.465 --> 15:35.602
I mean, this-this...
this is your organ.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.604
It's your body.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.606
It's your life.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.508
Honey,

15:41.608 --> 15:44.644
I want nothing more than for
my best friend to get a kidney,

15:44.744 --> 15:47.780
except to protect my baby boy.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.482
If you want
to back out right now,

15:49.582 --> 15:52.452
I will drive the getaway car,
no questions asked.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.824
Hey.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.230
I don't want a getaway car.

16:03.330 --> 16:06.733
Look, I'm healthy,
and I'm a perfect donor,

16:06.833 --> 16:09.336
and that's according
to the transplant team.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.874
So, please, don't worry.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.376
I am your mom.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.845
Worrying is in
the job description.
Yes, I know.

16:18.945 --> 16:21.214
Absolutely.
I've heard it my whole life.

16:22.715 --> 16:25.052
I'm ready, Mom.

16:25.152 --> 16:27.320
I wouldn't do this if I weren't.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.622
Now, come on.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.958
Mmm.
I'm still your peanut.

16:32.059 --> 16:35.028
You are.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.664
Hey, Freddy.
Freddy, easy.

16:37.764 --> 16:39.499
Easy. Tree's still
not anchored yet.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.168
How much longer, Beck?

16:41.268 --> 16:42.469
Never done this without Cap.

16:42.569 --> 16:43.903
It's gonna take
as long as it takes.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.740
Hey, hey, stop, stop.

16:47.840 --> 16:48.841
Stop! Everyone, stop!
Stop now!

16:48.941 --> 16:50.210
Stop. She can't breathe.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.179
Freddy. Freddy,
give me hand. Come on.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.681
Help me get this branch
off her neck.

16:57.250 --> 17:00.753
Hey, I'm really sorry
about that.

17:00.853 --> 17:04.557
I'm not going out like this.
This is not how I go out!

17:05.358 --> 17:06.993
Freddy, find something
out of one of the packs

17:07.094 --> 17:08.528
so we can cinch it
around this branch

17:08.628 --> 17:09.862
and get it up off her neck.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.198
Give her some breathing room.

17:11.298 --> 17:12.399
You got this?
Yup.

17:12.499 --> 17:13.800
Bode, you got this?

17:13.900 --> 17:16.203
It's not how you go out.
All right.

17:16.303 --> 17:19.539
We got a lot of people
to save still, you and me.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.541
Yeah.

17:21.641 --> 17:24.043
Around there.

17:24.144 --> 17:27.480
Okay, okay.
Now we get it tight.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.883
Pressure on that.

17:30.983 --> 17:33.253
Okay.
Go, get in, get in.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.287
Here.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.822
All right,
everybody keep moving.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.524
I found the radio.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.127
Come...

17:40.227 --> 17:42.162
Go ahead, give him a hand.

17:42.262 --> 17:45.064
Ah. Come to Mama. Yes.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.334
Hey, Rohan, get in there.
You got it, Bode.

17:48.335 --> 17:50.270
Here.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.742
Greencrest, this is
Three Rock Crew 4.

17:55.842 --> 17:59.512
We got a firefighter trapped
under a tree at Silver Hills.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.983
You're supposed to be resting.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.985
You're supposed
to be with Jake.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.087
Yeah, well, Jake said
I was driving him crazy,

18:08.188 --> 18:09.689
so he kicked me out. Oh.

18:09.789 --> 18:12.459
I might be crazy. I think
I just heard Bode's voice.

18:12.559 --> 18:15.562
Nearest heliteam is 834.

18:15.662 --> 18:18.097
Greencrest.
This is Division Chief Leone.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.233
Can you confirm
the incident location?

18:20.333 --> 18:22.335
Silver Hills at Canyon Road.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.605
Oh. Okay. That's where
Eve took Bode's crew.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.607
These blades are no joke.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.876
Be careful, Gabriela.
You think I'm not?

18:29.976 --> 18:32.479
I'm just making sure, <i>mija.</i>
Hey, hey, we're all
on the same team here.

18:33.846 --> 18:35.148
There. Done.

18:35.248 --> 18:36.849
Okay.
Can you get his hand out?

18:40.453 --> 18:43.490
Okay.
Let's do this.

18:44.657 --> 18:45.925
It won't budge.

18:46.025 --> 18:47.560
Because the spindle's bent.

18:47.660 --> 18:51.264
Chief, we might need to
take this whole chopper apart.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.434
Alberto.

18:56.536 --> 18:59.071
I only took a year of Spanish,
but that doesn't sound right.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.740
No, his-his
pulse is weak.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.075
He's losing too much blood.

19:03.176 --> 19:04.644
Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.113
Manny, compressions are
impossible in that position.

19:07.214 --> 19:08.648
Well, he can't hang
by his hand, Chief.

19:08.748 --> 19:09.916
It'll tear right off.

19:10.016 --> 19:12.385
Gabriela,
go find me a flat surface.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.886
We need to improvise
a spine board.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.189
Go, go, go.

19:16.289 --> 19:17.824
Stats are dropping.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.426
Hey, hey.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.528
Airway stays open at all times.
Keep his chin up.

19:21.628 --> 19:22.695
I got it, Chief.

19:22.795 --> 19:23.963
We're running on
borrowed time here,

19:24.063 --> 19:25.398
so move it.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.734
Oh, let's go.
Let's put that board behind him.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.703
Guys?

19:30.803 --> 19:32.171
Guys, I'm not getting a pulse.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.941
I got him.
Starting compressions.

19:35.041 --> 19:37.310
We are not gonna lose this guy.
Come on.

19:40.146 --> 19:41.147
Come on, Alberto.

19:50.223 --> 19:51.824
All right, let's go,
keep cutting.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.793
Got to get her out of here.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.764
We're losing sunlight fast.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.799
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.902
You can't miss Sharon's
surgery. You got to go.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.271
Don't worry
about that right now.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.539
Didn't they say they
were sending a copter?

20:06.639 --> 20:08.341
This is Division 1501.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.710
Go to Tac Three.

20:12.945 --> 20:16.148
Mom? Aren't you in the hospital?

20:16.249 --> 20:18.451
I heard one of your
crew is trapped?

20:18.551 --> 20:20.052
It's Eve.

20:20.152 --> 20:23.256
Oh, come on.
What's her status?

20:23.356 --> 20:24.824
She's hanging in there.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.959
But where the hell
is this rescue team?

20:27.059 --> 20:28.761
Okay, the ground team got
lost trying to get to you.

20:28.861 --> 20:30.330
The copter's
only T-minus five.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.799
They're just looking for a place
to drop the hoist.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.301
She might be hypothermic.

20:34.401 --> 20:38.305
She-She's conscious, but...
she's hypothermic.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.806
Okay.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.208
Do you have rescue
blankets with you?

20:42.309 --> 20:44.210
Yeah, we-we got 'em,
but there's no way

20:44.311 --> 20:46.045
to get 'em around her until
we clear some of these branches.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.547
She's caught in this tree.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.382
Warm compresses.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.918
You should have them
in the first-aid kit.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.086
Yeah, Rohan's already on it.

20:54.954 --> 20:56.423
She doesn't look good.

20:56.523 --> 20:57.757
Okay.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.158
You keep doing
what you're doing.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.827
You're just raising
her body temperature.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.362
You're buying her time.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.697
I know you can do that.

21:07.166 --> 21:10.303
I got a pulse!
I got a pulse.

21:11.304 --> 21:12.772
I got respirations.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.575
O'Reilly, go see if you can find
a drill laying around someplace.

21:15.675 --> 21:16.809
Perez, grab your wrench.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.378
We got to finish
taking this thing apart.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.355
Eve. Hey, how you doing?

21:28.455 --> 21:30.657
Uh, Bode...

21:30.757 --> 21:32.992
I've been running it
through my mind, and

21:33.092 --> 21:34.794
there's no quick way
to get out of here.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.596
I don't know
how much longer I have.

21:36.696 --> 21:38.498
No, look,
we're close, all right?

21:38.598 --> 21:40.367
Copter will be here any minute.

21:41.368 --> 21:42.569
Here.

21:42.669 --> 21:45.237
My crew had another.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.141
You're gonna be okay.

21:49.241 --> 21:50.843
Okay? We're gonna get you out.

21:50.943 --> 21:54.013
I thought you didn't believe
in false promises.

21:54.113 --> 21:56.583
Yeah.

21:56.683 --> 22:00.387
I'm really sorry about earlier.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.989
Okay, I can be cynical, and...

22:03.089 --> 22:05.224
borderline disrespectful,

22:05.324 --> 22:08.528
and a pain in the ass to almost
anyone you ask who knows me,

22:08.628 --> 22:12.131
but I... I really do mean well.

22:12.231 --> 22:15.201
I'm just... I'm not
used to people helping me.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.937
I get it.

22:18.037 --> 22:20.407
I...

22:20.507 --> 22:24.210
I wish that I could
help myself right now, so...

22:31.484 --> 22:33.520
The copter's incoming.

22:33.620 --> 22:36.956
I don't know how a copter's
gonna... help me

22:37.056 --> 22:39.692
without this tree
killing me, but...

22:39.792 --> 22:41.828
if I don't
m-make it out of here...

22:41.928 --> 22:45.031
You are.
If I don't,

22:45.131 --> 22:48.100
you take the baton

22:48.200 --> 22:51.137
and set up the...
pre-parole program.

22:51.237 --> 22:54.206
Okay.
That's my purpose.

22:54.306 --> 22:56.175
And if I...

22:56.275 --> 22:58.344
And if you deny me that
and I die,

22:58.445 --> 23:01.047
then I'm gonna
haunt your ass forever.

23:01.848 --> 23:03.315
That's not funny.

23:03.416 --> 23:06.385
Your purpose is not
to help Three Rock.

23:06.486 --> 23:09.522
Your purpose
is to-to live for you.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.401
Something's wrong.

23:22.502 --> 23:24.904
I can see that.
Hang on, Bode.

23:25.004 --> 23:25.972
Do you have them?

23:26.072 --> 23:27.640
Okay, this is D.C. Leone.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.042
I need an update on the
copter rescue on Silver Hills.

23:30.142 --> 23:32.111
Visibility's low.

23:32.211 --> 23:34.714
Copter 108's having trouble
getting low enough

23:34.814 --> 23:36.415
to perform a hoist rescue.

23:41.588 --> 23:44.190
Wait.
Are they leaving?

23:44.290 --> 23:46.192
Okay, Greencrest,
can you Confirm

23:46.292 --> 23:48.495
the team's ready
to lower the hoist?

23:48.595 --> 23:52.565
Negative. Copter 108 is unable
to perform the rescue.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.767
Responding engines are
approximately 20 minutes

23:54.867 --> 23:56.469
from your location.

23:56.569 --> 23:57.670
Plus a three-mile hike.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.271
Eve doesn't have
that kind of time.

23:59.371 --> 24:01.741
Hi.
I need to start your IV.

24:01.841 --> 24:02.842
Other arm.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.611
Excuse me?
She's trying

24:04.711 --> 24:06.378
to save an injured firefighter. Please.

24:06.479 --> 24:08.715
Okay, we don't need
a hoist rescue.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.416
There's a suitable landing zone

24:10.517 --> 24:12.318
a half a mile south
of the lodge.

24:12.418 --> 24:14.353
The copter should just
land right there.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.688
Copy.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.758
Copter's landing.

24:18.858 --> 24:21.360
How is it going, Bode?

24:21.460 --> 24:22.895
Working on these
bigger branches,

24:22.995 --> 24:24.631
trying to quick fab
a cross-brace.

24:24.731 --> 24:25.998
We've barely made a dent, B.

24:26.098 --> 24:27.333
Yeah, we can't work any faster

24:27.433 --> 24:30.102
without jeopardizing
the stability of the tree.

24:31.638 --> 24:34.340
All right.
I say we try and slide her out.

24:34.440 --> 24:37.043
Little help here.
Let's go!

24:37.143 --> 24:40.012
Hey. Hey, just hold steady.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.548
Can't imagine this is
gonna feel good.

24:41.648 --> 24:43.850
All right, I got this.
All right, on me.

24:43.950 --> 24:45.552
One, two, three.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.053
Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

24:47.153 --> 24:48.821
My boot's caught in a branch. Uh,

24:48.921 --> 24:50.957
I think I can reach it
if I just slide in over there.

24:51.057 --> 24:52.625
No, no, Reb-Rebecca.
This tree's unstab...
No, I got it, I got it.

24:52.725 --> 24:55.928
Rebecca, stop.
I can do it.

24:56.028 --> 24:57.229
Go-go get her.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.431
Go, go, go.

24:59.532 --> 25:00.767
Let's go, we got her.

25:08.775 --> 25:10.877
Eve's out.
Good work. Copy that.

25:10.977 --> 25:12.178
Lift!

25:12.278 --> 25:13.546
Holy crap, dude.

25:13.646 --> 25:15.715
I didn't think
you were gonna get me out.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.116
No offense, though.

25:17.216 --> 25:19.686
Okay, guys, let's
get her out of here.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.793
Yeah, I see a path. Hey.

25:26.893 --> 25:28.761
We did it.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.730
Take my hand.
Thank you.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.431
Oh!
Rebecca!

25:41.007 --> 25:43.876
Rebecca? Rebecca,
can you hear me?

25:45.444 --> 25:48.581
Pulse is racing. She must
be bleeding internally.

25:49.582 --> 25:51.017
Bode?

25:51.117 --> 25:52.351
Yeah, I'm here.

25:52.451 --> 25:55.021
Rebecca, this tree
shifted and came loose.

25:56.889 --> 25:57.790
Her breaths are shallow.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.491
She could be going into shock.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.828
Hey, look at this.

26:05.965 --> 26:07.566
Seriously?

26:10.469 --> 26:12.338
This tree was already cut.

26:12.438 --> 26:15.174
And that's why it fell.

26:16.943 --> 26:20.179
Bode, talk to me.

26:21.347 --> 26:23.382
We evacuated Eve.

26:23.482 --> 26:26.252
Rebecca got hit by the tree.

26:27.053 --> 26:30.389
It was partially cut,
it wasn't even tagged.

26:30.489 --> 26:31.991
Some crew screwed up
and they tried

26:32.091 --> 26:33.960
to cover up their mistakes,
and that's why this happened.

26:34.060 --> 26:37.029
And it's gonna take too long to
get a helicopter back up there.

26:37.129 --> 26:39.231
Bode, can you carry
Rebecca down?

26:39.331 --> 26:40.700
We don't have a stretcher.

26:42.401 --> 26:45.872
Hi.
We can't wait any longer.

26:45.972 --> 26:47.807
Sharon you have helped them.

26:47.907 --> 26:49.976
Now it's time
to let Dr. Ray help you.

26:50.076 --> 26:51.510
Come on.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.914
I'm gonna go into surgery.

26:55.014 --> 26:57.049
But you got to get
a couple of branches,

26:57.149 --> 26:58.685
and you tie
your jackets together,

26:58.785 --> 27:01.020
and you make a stretcher.

27:02.889 --> 27:06.225
Yeah.
I wanted to be there.

27:06.325 --> 27:08.728
I tried.

27:10.329 --> 27:13.599
I'm gonna see you
on the other side.

27:16.368 --> 27:17.870
I love you.

27:18.805 --> 27:20.673
Yeah, but I love you more.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.683
Greencrest, Division 1501.

27:30.783 --> 27:33.853
Clearing
the Silver Hills incident.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.457
You have a good son.

27:38.557 --> 27:41.761
Yeah, I do.

27:42.795 --> 27:44.363
So do you.

27:44.463 --> 27:47.333
You should go be with him now.

27:48.367 --> 27:49.435
Okay.

27:49.535 --> 27:52.304
Thank you.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.340
Ambulance is on scene.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.777
The bolt is worn out.
I can't get a grip on it.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.345
Just rip off the panel.

28:00.646 --> 28:02.248
You might want to tell
him to look away.

28:04.650 --> 28:06.452
There.

28:06.552 --> 28:08.154
Okay,

28:08.254 --> 28:10.857
uh, he is missing
two fingers.

28:10.957 --> 28:12.391
Don't translate that.

28:12.491 --> 28:13.860
Okay, let's find them.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.461
Frozen bait probably
kept them viable

28:15.561 --> 28:17.096
to reattach at the hospital.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.665
Behind.

28:20.833 --> 28:23.702
Got one...

28:26.773 --> 28:28.841
Oh, my God, it's grosser
than the raw bait.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.910
He was in cardiac arrest,
but we got him back.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.711
He might still be
hypotensive, though.

28:33.512 --> 28:35.782
Murphy, get everybody back
to the station, okay?

28:35.882 --> 28:37.149
I got to get to
my wife's surgery.

28:37.249 --> 28:39.018
Hey, great work, everybody.

28:39.819 --> 28:41.120
There you go.

28:56.903 --> 28:59.939
Um, uh, what
was that about?

29:00.039 --> 29:02.241
My dad took the blame
for Alberto

29:02.341 --> 29:04.343
so that he wouldn't
lose his job.

29:04.443 --> 29:07.413
All while I was busy
thinking the worst of him.

29:12.885 --> 29:14.420
Here we go.
On my count.

29:14.520 --> 29:17.223
One, two, three.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.492
That doesn't sound good.

29:20.592 --> 29:23.329
She's hemodynamically stable,
but in severe pain.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.965
Hard to know much more
without imaging.

29:26.899 --> 29:28.968
I-I need one more jacket.

29:33.806 --> 29:35.875
Thanks, man.

29:35.975 --> 29:38.144
Y'all are gonna freeze to death.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.546
I bet you wish you'd done more
for my case now, huh,

29:40.646 --> 29:41.914
that I gave you my jacket?

29:42.014 --> 29:43.916
You should tell him.

29:44.716 --> 29:46.352
Tell me what?

29:46.452 --> 29:49.021
I called in a favor for you...

29:49.121 --> 29:51.590
with the Innocence Project.

29:51.690 --> 29:53.425
For real?
Mm-hmm.

29:53.525 --> 29:54.961
I'm getting a retrial?

29:55.061 --> 29:58.831
Eh. They're just reviewing
your file for now.

29:58.931 --> 30:00.699
Baby steps.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.201
You did that for me?

30:02.301 --> 30:03.903
And you said nothing.
Why?

30:04.003 --> 30:08.440
Didn't want
to get your hopes up.

30:09.876 --> 30:11.878
It's a big deal, Freddy.

30:11.978 --> 30:14.313
Means you could get out, man.

30:15.114 --> 30:17.749
Then we better get my lawyer
off this hill.

30:17.850 --> 30:19.551
Ow.

30:19.651 --> 30:22.088
Let's get this thing here--
let's get her on there, okay?

30:22.188 --> 30:26.592
Over. In position on me.

30:26.692 --> 30:28.227
Let's move, guys.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.561
Okay, okay.

30:37.103 --> 30:38.504
Hey, I'll be
right there.
Got it.

30:38.604 --> 30:40.306
Thanks.

30:40.406 --> 30:43.876
You didn't listen to
my voice mail, did you?

30:46.578 --> 30:48.280
What voice mail?

30:50.082 --> 30:51.984
I left you a nasty voice mail
this morning

30:52.084 --> 30:54.820
when I thought
you were gambling again.

30:57.823 --> 31:00.059
I wasn't.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.395
I haven't been.

31:03.495 --> 31:05.364
I know that now.

31:05.464 --> 31:09.001
But why didn't you tell me
about your second job?

31:11.637 --> 31:13.872
'Cause I was embarrassed.

31:17.743 --> 31:21.380
Guess I was the one looking
down on honest work, huh?

31:21.480 --> 31:23.649
A job is a job.

31:23.749 --> 31:26.552
You did teach me that.

31:28.687 --> 31:31.857
Hey, I'm proud of you, Dad.

31:39.398 --> 31:42.168
Just erase it.
Trust me.

31:43.702 --> 31:45.404
My crew's in trouble.

31:48.674 --> 31:51.077
There he is.

31:51.177 --> 31:53.645
I'll give you
two a moment.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.156
I know you don't want to talk

32:04.256 --> 32:06.258
about what happens
if something goes wrong here.

32:06.358 --> 32:09.128
Really don't.
But I... I have to.

32:09.228 --> 32:12.965
'Cause, you know, you and I

32:13.065 --> 32:16.235
have spent the best years
of our lives together.

32:16.335 --> 32:18.604
We've been through
hell and back.

32:22.208 --> 32:24.176
And there's nobody

32:24.276 --> 32:27.913
I'd rather walk
through the fire with than you.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.450
You're gonna
ruin all this mascara

32:31.550 --> 32:33.619
that I just put on.

32:33.719 --> 32:36.855
When I saw that you checked
the little box

32:36.955 --> 32:38.991
that said, "Do not resuscitate,"

32:39.091 --> 32:42.361
I... I kind of panicked
a little bit.

32:42.461 --> 32:45.597
But guess what?

32:45.697 --> 32:47.899
I can.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.336
I can live without you.

32:51.703 --> 32:54.306
I, uh, I live
without my daughter.

32:54.406 --> 32:58.077
I hate it, but I do it.

32:59.845 --> 33:01.213
And the thought of

33:01.313 --> 33:03.715
having to do it w-with...

33:03.815 --> 33:06.252
without you...

33:10.522 --> 33:13.059
You're the reason
I get up in the morning.

33:13.159 --> 33:14.893
You are...

33:14.993 --> 33:18.597
You're the reason
I keep going, Share.

33:26.138 --> 33:27.806
It's time.
Are you ready?

33:27.906 --> 33:31.943
No. No.
No, no, no, no.

33:32.044 --> 33:35.847
I... I-I didn't think
about anybody,

33:35.947 --> 33:37.949
and I didn't make a will.

33:38.050 --> 33:40.352
I'm so sorry. Oh.

33:40.452 --> 33:43.889
Hey, do you even know where
my... my good pearls are?

33:43.989 --> 33:46.825
Oh.
What? No. No clue.

33:46.925 --> 33:48.360
Okay, listen to me.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.396
You have to help
Bode do good time.

33:50.496 --> 33:53.465
You have to... you have
to love him for me.

33:53.565 --> 33:56.335
You have to love him
the way that I love him.

33:56.435 --> 33:59.371
He's gonna need you more.
I will.

33:59.471 --> 34:02.741
Okay, you have to take me
right now before I chicken out.

34:02.841 --> 34:04.443
Just, let's go.

34:07.613 --> 34:09.981
I love you.

34:10.082 --> 34:13.018
Okay. Oh.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.945
Leone?

34:40.045 --> 34:41.813
Yeah.

34:41.913 --> 34:44.082
They're over here.
What's wrong?

34:44.183 --> 34:46.218
Bl-Blunt force trauma
to her abdomen.

34:46.318 --> 34:47.919
What's her name?
Rebecca.

34:48.019 --> 34:51.590
Rebecca, can you hear me?

34:51.690 --> 34:53.259
Uh, n-no. Hey, come on.

34:53.359 --> 34:54.493
What's happening?

34:54.593 --> 34:57.095
I don't have a pulse.
She's coding.

34:57.196 --> 34:58.664
No.

34:58.764 --> 35:00.132
Starting compressions.

35:02.634 --> 35:05.471
No, no, no,
this can't be happening.

35:05.571 --> 35:08.174
Has it been an hour yet?

35:08.274 --> 35:11.577
Vince, will you sit down?
You're making me nervous.

35:11.677 --> 35:14.246
Yeah, I do that, apparently.

35:14.346 --> 35:16.815
Oh. Hey.

35:16.915 --> 35:18.550
How's Rebecca?

35:18.650 --> 35:21.052
Her spleen ruptured en route.

35:21.153 --> 35:23.021
They took her into surgery.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.857
Dr. Brown's on call.
She's in good hands. I'm Lilly.

35:25.957 --> 35:28.894
Oh. Hey, uh,
Manny, this is Lilly.

35:28.994 --> 35:30.562
Lilly's Jake's mom.

35:30.662 --> 35:32.598
Oh.

35:32.698 --> 35:35.434
Can you give us
just a second?

35:35.534 --> 35:36.868
Sure.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.673
Chief, I should've been there

35:41.773 --> 35:44.109
on that hill with my guys today.

35:45.010 --> 35:47.546
Rebecca's tough, right?

35:47.646 --> 35:49.781
She'll pull through.
And Eve--

35:49.881 --> 35:52.351
she'll be okay, too.

35:54.152 --> 35:56.522
She's the help
I never knew I needed.

35:56.622 --> 35:58.324
Insanely talented.

35:58.424 --> 36:00.326
And I wasn't
there for her today.

36:00.426 --> 36:03.295
Why? Because I need
an extra paycheck. No.

36:03.395 --> 36:06.064
What kind of captain
am I, Chief?
Hey,

36:06.164 --> 36:08.133
you know you can stay with us
as long as you want.

36:08.234 --> 36:09.901
I still owe you
ten grand, man.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.370
Forget about the debt, okay?

36:11.470 --> 36:15.741
Vince, I told you
I was gonna pay you back.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.876
And all I have left
is my word, man.

36:19.678 --> 36:23.349
Okay.
Okay.

36:29.955 --> 36:31.790
WOMAN (over P.A.):

36:31.890 --> 36:33.392
Staff, Code Blue.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.763
Sharon.

36:39.965 --> 36:42.100
Hey, hey, uh...

36:42.200 --> 36:43.602
My wife is in surgery.
Is she okay?

36:43.702 --> 36:46.171
Um, I'm afraid it's the donor.

36:46.272 --> 36:47.239
I'm Jake's mom.

36:47.339 --> 36:48.607
They're doing everything
they can.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.409
Well, do more.

36:50.509 --> 36:51.577
Captain Perez.

36:51.677 --> 36:54.313
I have an update
on the inmate.

36:54.413 --> 36:55.347
Is Rebecca okay?

36:58.484 --> 37:00.786
Bode, stop! Stop!

37:00.886 --> 37:03.955
Stop, Bode.

37:07.326 --> 37:09.328
We lost her.

37:11.096 --> 37:14.165
She's gone.
I'm so sorry, Bode.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.205
Hey, hey.

37:20.306 --> 37:23.675
My dad said she lost
too much blood.

37:23.775 --> 37:25.844
Her body couldn't recover.

37:28.179 --> 37:31.850
She was gonna help Freddy
get a retrial.

37:31.950 --> 37:35.053
He signed up
for a pre-parole program.

37:36.655 --> 37:38.957
S-She wanted to help people.

37:44.296 --> 37:46.932
She helped me
every time I needed it.

37:47.799 --> 37:50.101
Rebecca did good time.

37:53.705 --> 37:56.107
We had no captain.

37:59.845 --> 38:02.080
The guys wanted to stay and...

38:02.180 --> 38:04.416
and wait for help, but I...

38:04.516 --> 38:07.586
I convinced them we could
rescue Eve ourselves.

38:08.820 --> 38:10.656
And you did.

38:10.756 --> 38:12.624
Eve is alive.

38:12.724 --> 38:14.960
Because of you.

38:15.761 --> 38:17.863
Rebecca's dead.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.264
It's my fault she's gone.

38:19.365 --> 38:21.800
It's lights out, Leone.

38:21.900 --> 38:25.303
And you know you can't be here.

38:25.404 --> 38:27.406
Yeah.

38:27.506 --> 38:29.274
So what are you gonna
do about it?

38:29.375 --> 38:31.943
Gonna write me up?
Go ahead. Go on.

38:34.346 --> 38:35.881
Here.

38:39.284 --> 38:41.286
Read it.

38:47.359 --> 38:49.428
You approved my furlough.

38:49.528 --> 38:51.196
I'm sorry about Rebecca.

38:51.296 --> 38:53.865
It's a short ride
to the hospital.

38:54.900 --> 38:57.002
The buggy leaves in ten.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.641
Bode. You did it.

39:02.741 --> 39:04.976
You get to see your mom.

39:06.211 --> 39:08.079
No, Rebecca did it.
