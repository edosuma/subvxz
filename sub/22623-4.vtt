18:11.624 --> 18:13.591
BUT HERE'S THE MOST INTERESTING:

18:13.659 --> 18:17.027
Pastor Edmund Thompson.
He spent five years

18:17.096 --> 18:19.997
in Kingston Penitentiary
for armed robbery.

18:20.065 --> 18:21.999
- A man of the cloth who's done
hard time.

18:22.067 --> 18:24.001
- Just because the pastor
is a convicted felon

18:24.003 --> 18:26.003
doesn't mean he'd harm his own daughter.

18:26.071 --> 18:27.972
- He was losing his meal ticket.

18:28.040 --> 18:31.542
- Well, maybe he
thought if he scared her,

18:31.544 --> 18:33.711
she'd just give up
the notion of jazz singing.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.713
- Or he was just angry
with her for some reason.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.616
- Any luck tracking the blue
vehicle's license plate?

18:38.684 --> 18:41.185
- No, I'm sorry. It know that it
was stolen from The Annex

18:41.253 --> 18:43.053
- about three weeks ago.
- Can you look into

18:43.122 --> 18:45.022
another suspect for us? His name

18:45.091 --> 18:47.358
- is Tickles Malone.
- Tickles?

18:47.426 --> 18:49.827
- He's a pianist.
- And a hustler.

18:49.896 --> 18:53.498
- Claims that he's only interested
in Elsie's singing career.

18:53.566 --> 18:56.734
- Maybe he's tickling
more than just the ivories?

18:56.802 --> 18:58.703
- Mary!

18:58.771 --> 19:01.439
I'm shocked.

19:01.507 --> 19:04.041
I wonder if Tickles has gotten
Elsie mixed up in something.

19:04.110 --> 19:06.310
- I didn't have
much luck with him.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.879
Maybe you should go
down there and have a chat?

19:08.948 --> 19:11.516

will have more luck?

he was looking at her.

- It's time to have a chat

19:15.788 --> 19:18.422

You have to. I'm her father.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.584

everyone is a suspect.

19:48.887 --> 19:51.622

have a criminal past,

19:51.624 --> 19:53.558
I'd try to hurt my own daughter?

I thank God every day

as far as Port Credit...

22:00.820 --> 22:03.487
- and then I got cold feet.
- Was he cute?

22:03.556 --> 22:05.523
- Cute enough to run away with.

you end up with Adrian?

22:09.695 --> 22:11.929

singer at The Sapphire Club.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.396

22:45.464 --> 22:47.264

just singing some hymns.

22:50.936 --> 22:53.204

decided to be a singer.

pastor of using fake money?

it was the collection.

Elsie with it, they'll be able

36:23.749 --> 36:25.582
