00:05.640 --> 00:07.760
<i>This is Michael Bluth.</i>

00:07.880 --> 00:09.760
<i>For 10 years, he's worked
for his father's company...</i>

00:09.880 --> 00:11.800
<i>waiting to be made a partner.</i>

00:11.880 --> 00:14.600
<i>And right now, he's happy.</i>

00:14.680 --> 00:17.280
<i>- This is Michael's mother.
- Look what they've done, Michael.</i>

00:17.400 --> 00:18.920
<i>She isn't happy.</i>

00:19.040 --> 00:21.520
Look what the homosexuals
have done to me.

00:21.640 --> 00:23.960
You can't just comb that out
and reset it?

00:24.040 --> 00:27.240
<i>Currently, she's upset that her
husband's retirement party...</i>

00:27.320 --> 00:30.000
<i>is being upstaged by a group
of gay protesters.</i>

00:30.120 --> 00:33.000
We're here! We're queer!
We want to get married on the ocean!

00:33.120 --> 00:36.360
Everything they do
is so dramatic and flamboyant.

00:36.480 --> 00:40.080
It just makes me
want to set myself on fire.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.560
Good grief, Mother.

00:42.680 --> 00:45.200
Not all homosexuals
are flamboy...

00:45.320 --> 00:47.240
Oh, my God! I have
the exact same blouse.

00:47.360 --> 00:49.520
<i>This is Michael's twin sister, Lindsay.</i>

00:49.640 --> 00:51.440
I like it better on him.

00:51.560 --> 00:54.040
<i>As a youthful act of defiance,
Lindsay married...</i>

00:54.120 --> 00:55.960
<i>this man.</i>

00:56.040 --> 00:58.480
<i>They moved to Boston,
where they've become celebrated...</i>

00:58.600 --> 01:00.960
<i>for their wine and cheese
fund-raisers.</i>

01:01.040 --> 01:03.160
Oh, no.
I'm completely stuffed.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.640
<i>Michael and his sister
haven't spoken in a year.</i>

01:05.720 --> 01:07.680
<i>Neither has acknowledged this.</i>

01:07.800 --> 01:10.120
<i>And this is Gob,
Michael's oldest brother.</i>

01:10.240 --> 01:13.080
<i>So, this is the magic trick, huh?</i>

01:13.160 --> 01:16.840
Illusion, Michael. A trick is something
a whore does for money.

01:20.320 --> 01:22.160
Or candy.

01:22.280 --> 01:25.760
<i>Gob recently started
the Alliance of Magicians...</i>

01:25.880 --> 01:27.760
<i>an organization that blackballs
any performer...</i>

01:27.880 --> 01:30.040
<i>who reveals a magician's secret.</i>

01:30.120 --> 01:32.160
<i>And finally there's Buster...</i>

01:32.240 --> 01:35.360
<i>- Hey, Buster.
- the youngest of Michael's siblings.</i>

01:35.440 --> 01:38.480
You know, you don't need
to do that, buddy. It's okay.

01:38.600 --> 01:41.040
<i>Thanks to the family's largesse,
Buster has studied everything...</i>

01:41.160 --> 01:43.720
<i>from Native American
tribal ceremonies...</i>

01:45.720 --> 01:49.040
<i>to cartography, the mapping
of uncharted territories.</i>

01:49.160 --> 01:52.040
Hasn't everything already
sort of been discovered, though...

01:52.160 --> 01:54.880
by, like, Magellan and Cortés?

01:54.960 --> 01:56.800
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- All those folks.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.720
Those guys did a pretty good job...

01:58.800 --> 02:01.960
but there's still, you know...

02:02.080 --> 02:05.240
<i>He also suffers
from crippling panic attacks.</i>

02:05.320 --> 02:07.760
<i>Yes, this is his family.</i>

02:07.880 --> 02:09.840
<i>So why is Michael so happy?</i>

02:09.960 --> 02:13.200
<i>Because he's decided to never
speak to these people again.</i>

02:19.960 --> 02:22.760
<i>Michael was feeling more
generous about his family...</i>

02:22.880 --> 02:25.040
<i>on the morning of the boat party.</i>

02:25.160 --> 02:29.520
What comes before anything? What have we
always said is the most important thing?

02:29.640 --> 02:33.000
- Breakfast.
- Family.

02:33.120 --> 02:36.360
Family. Right. I thought
you meant of the things you eat.

02:36.480 --> 02:39.240
<i>This is Michael's son, George Michael.</i>

02:39.360 --> 02:41.880
I mean, we have made nothing
but sacrifices for this family...

02:41.960 --> 02:43.720
<i>and tonight
it all pays off, my boy.</i>

02:43.840 --> 02:46.640
Tonight your granddad
makes me partner.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.040
<i>To prove his dedication
to the family business...</i>

02:49.160 --> 02:52.080
<i>Michael has decided to live here...
in the model unit...</i>

02:52.200 --> 02:54.040
<i>ofhis father's latest housing tract.</i>

02:54.120 --> 02:57.000
<i>The guys live in the attic
so that the house...</i>

02:57.120 --> 02:59.280
<i>can still function
as a pristine selling tool.</i>

02:59.400 --> 03:01.240
<i>And when I do get that promotion...</i>

03:01.320 --> 03:03.560
I'll finally be able
to get you what you deserve.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.720
Like a real home.

03:05.800 --> 03:08.040
This is a real home.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.360
No, it's not.
It's a fake home, son.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.280
You want the loops
or the flakes today?

03:12.360 --> 03:14.520
<i>The guys then
headed down to Balboa Island...</i>

03:14.600 --> 03:16.920
<i>so George Michael could work
at the frozen banana stand...</i>

03:17.000 --> 03:18.960
<i>his grandfather started in 1953.</i>

03:19.080 --> 03:20.560
Bananas.

03:20.680 --> 03:23.880
<i>Michael, meanwhile,
was meeting his brother Gob...</i>

03:23.960 --> 03:25.920
<i>hoping to discuss
his father's boat party.</i>

03:26.040 --> 03:28.640
<i>Do you have your check
for your share of the party?</i>

03:28.760 --> 03:31.120
You know, I sort of thought
my contribution...

03:31.240 --> 03:33.040
could be a magic show.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.760
- Oh, that's perfect, Gob.
- Thank you.

03:36.840 --> 03:40.040
I just remembered something.
Dad's retiring, not turning six.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.880
Hey, come on! I just bought this new
illusion called the Aztec Tomb.

03:43.960 --> 03:46.274
- It cost like 18 grand!
I'm gonna do it on the boat.

03:46.275 --> 03:47.075
- I don't care.

03:47.080 --> 03:50.040
What do you care? Can't you just charge
the party to the company?

03:50.120 --> 03:51.038
- It's not a business expense.

03:51.039 --> 03:53.120
- So what? Lindsay's been staying
at the Four Seasons for a month.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.400
She's probably charging the company.

03:55.520 --> 03:57.920
Lindsay's been in town for a month?

03:58.040 --> 04:00.840
I don't think so.

04:00.960 --> 04:03.320
<i>Michael was upset to hear this...</i>

04:03.400 --> 04:05.600
<i>so he went to discuss it with his mother.</i>

04:05.680 --> 04:09.080
Mom! Mother! Give me your
company checkbook. You're cut off.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.880
Michael, look.
Look what happened to my fox.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.520
Someone cut off his little foot.

04:14.600 --> 04:17.480
Is it... Is it noticeable?

04:17.600 --> 04:18.394
You've gotta remember...

04:18.396 --> 04:19.920
you're gonna be all
splattered in red paint.

04:20.040 --> 04:21.839
That's gonna distract the eye.

04:21.959 --> 04:25.320
I don't want you charging any more
of your personal expenses to the company.

04:25.440 --> 04:29.040
Well, I had to pay for the Aztec Tomb.
Gob says it's a career maker.

04:29.160 --> 04:32.400
Wait a minute. The company
paid for the Aztec Tomb? That's great.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.560
Well, I was talking about Lindsay, okay?

04:34.640 --> 04:36.700
You put her in a
five-star hotel, on top

04:36.701 --> 04:38.960
of which you didn't
tell me she was in town.

04:39.080 --> 04:42.800
<i>If you're saying I play favorites, you're
wrong. I love all my children equally.</i>

04:42.920 --> 04:45.240
I don't care for Gob.

04:47.240 --> 04:50.560
Good grief. I dipped into
the kitty a couple of times.

04:50.680 --> 04:52.720
You should be focused on tonight.

04:52.840 --> 04:55.320
Dad's making a big announcement.

04:55.400 --> 04:58.960
Yeah? I knew it.
It's about me, isn't it?

05:00.520 --> 05:03.520
I wonder how I can talk you
out of ever making that face again.

05:03.640 --> 05:05.480
<i>Michael!</i>

05:05.560 --> 05:07.400
<i>Tobias.</i>

05:07.480 --> 05:10.440
How are you?

05:10.560 --> 05:13.880
Good, good.
How's your job search comin'?

05:15.960 --> 05:18.360
- It's good. It's going to be good.
- Yeah? Great.

05:18.440 --> 05:21.080
I'm hoping the universe
provides a path for me.

05:21.160 --> 05:23.560
<i>Tobias recently lost
his medical license...</i>

05:23.640 --> 05:26.440
<i>for administering C.P.R.
to a person who, as it turned out...</i>

05:26.560 --> 05:29.640
<i>was not having a heart attack.</i>

05:29.760 --> 05:34.000
Maybe you'll be inspired by the boat party
tonight, start a career as a pirate.

05:34.120 --> 05:36.560
I haven't packed for that.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.800
<i>- Couldn't find a thing.
- Lindsay!</i>

05:38.920 --> 05:41.680
- Michael!
- How was your flight?

05:41.800 --> 05:44.440
- Great. Great. We just got in.
- He knows.

05:44.520 --> 05:47.440
A month ago. Oh, I'm sorry.
I've been meaning to call you.

05:47.560 --> 05:49.000
- I really have.
- Really?

05:49.120 --> 05:52.160
- It's just been very busy.
- Ugh! It's been crazy.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.960
We just had an amazing
fund-raiser for HOOP.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.920
- HOOP?
- My anti-circumcision movement.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.920
I think it looks frightening
when it's cut off.

06:00.040 --> 06:01.840
It's a Doberman.
Let it have its ears.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.440
- Hmm.
- Believe it or not...

06:03.560 --> 06:06.280
we brought in over $40,000.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.520
Unbelievable. Sounds like you saved
enough skin to make 10 new boys.

06:09.640 --> 06:12.440
<i>Well, most of that money
was from the Bluth Company.</i>

06:12.520 --> 06:14.600
<i>I mean, how...</i>

06:16.000 --> 06:18.280
are you?

06:18.360 --> 06:20.200
Still good. You know what?

06:20.280 --> 06:22.720
You guys have had your hands
in the company coffer for years.

06:22.840 --> 06:26.040
But starting tomorrow, there is
going to be a new boss in town...

06:26.120 --> 06:29.200
and you're all gonna have to
start fending for yourselves.

06:29.320 --> 06:32.720
<i>You're all gonna finally feel
that sweet sting of sweat in your eyes.</i>

06:32.840 --> 06:34.760
As... Buster!

06:34.880 --> 06:38.520
<i>You can't do that
on the balcony, buddy?</i>

06:38.600 --> 06:41.000
Mom says it's too windy.

06:43.880 --> 06:46.120
<i>Who could've done this?</i>

06:46.240 --> 06:48.520
<i>While Michael
was getting fed up with his family...</i>

06:48.600 --> 06:51.560
<i>George Michael was finally
getting to know them.</i>

06:51.680 --> 06:54.600
Um, yeah. I bought
a frozen banana...

06:54.720 --> 06:57.640
and when I bit into it,
I found this.

06:57.760 --> 07:01.080
- Looks like a foot.
- It tasted like a foot.

07:01.160 --> 07:04.840
Which I didn't really mind,
but I'm pretty sure I said no nuts.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.880
Hey, you're my cousin,
aren't you?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.640
Maybe.

07:08.760 --> 07:12.280
<i>This is George Michael's cousin, Maeby.</i>

07:12.360 --> 07:14.960
- I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
- We never see you.

07:15.080 --> 07:17.080
We never see anybody in our family.

07:17.160 --> 07:20.280
I know. It's our parents' faults.
We should teach them a lesson.

07:20.360 --> 07:24.640
Yeah. No. I don't think so.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.600
I should go
to my mom tonight...

07:26.680 --> 07:28.920
and be like,
"I met the cutest guy. "

07:29.000 --> 07:32.840
And then she'll see you
and me totally making out.

07:32.960 --> 07:35.240
But... But not really, right?

07:35.320 --> 07:37.160
It's perfect.
She'd freak out...

07:37.240 --> 07:39.800
and I'd be like, "If we saw each other
more often, this wouldn't happen. "

07:39.880 --> 07:42.400
- But we're cousins.
- That's what makes it funny.

07:42.520 --> 07:46.280
- But isn't it against the law?
- Come on, George Michael.

07:49.720 --> 07:53.520
<i>Tobias, now believing
the boat party to be pirate-themed...</i>

07:53.640 --> 07:54.647
<i>- You look like a pirate!</i>

07:54.648 --> 07:56.840
- began searching through his
wife's luggage for an outfit.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.360
<i>I should say so!
Look at the blouse, sir!</i>

07:59.480 --> 08:03.720
<i>Then, mistaking a group
of garishly dressed men for pirates...</i>

08:03.800 --> 08:06.960
<i>Tobias boarded a van
full ofhomosexuals.</i>

08:07.080 --> 08:12.200
<i>Soon he was unwittingly part
of a protest against the local yacht club.</i>

08:12.280 --> 08:14.120
How are you?

08:14.200 --> 08:16.840
Oh, my God! I have
the exact same blouse.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.280
I like it better on him.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.240
<i>And Michael's big moment finally came.</i>

08:22.360 --> 08:25.920
I give you the new C.E.O.
for the Bluth Company.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.480
<i>Certainly the smartest Bluth.</i>

08:29.600 --> 08:31.520
My favorite Bluth.

08:31.640 --> 08:36.880
<i>And the, uh, sexiest creature
I have ever laid eyes on.</i>

08:38.440 --> 08:41.200
My lovely wife, Lucille.

08:44.840 --> 08:48.320
Mom!

08:48.440 --> 08:51.240
<i>Mom, congratulations!</i>

08:52.640 --> 08:54.920
Sorry. It's not the right time.

08:56.000 --> 09:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here

09:04.600 --> 09:08.120
<i>I'm not gonna lie to you, Michael.
This is great news for HOOP.</i>

09:23.400 --> 09:25.160
Hey.

09:25.280 --> 09:28.160
- You okay?
- You and I, we've waited long enough.

09:28.280 --> 09:31.680
It's time to move on.
All right?

09:33.160 --> 09:35.720
I guess we're gonna see
you guys even less now.

09:35.840 --> 09:38.040
I told you. We should've
taught them a lesson.

09:38.120 --> 09:40.360
<i>Lindsay, I want you
in this picture. Come on.</i>

09:45.720 --> 09:47.680
<i>All right. Let's see
some smiles, people.</i>

09:47.800 --> 09:51.640
It's a... It's a party,
not a shareholders' meeting.

09:51.720 --> 09:55.760
Are those police boats?

09:55.880 --> 09:58.240
No, I'm serious.
I think they are police boats.

09:58.360 --> 10:01.040
Prepare to be
boarded. Prepare to be boarded.

10:01.160 --> 10:02.690
- I knew it was against the law.

10:02.691 --> 10:05.080
- That's the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

10:05.160 --> 10:07.160
- They have boats?
- Give me a cell phone.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.680
Lindsay, Buster, up to the bridge!
Come on, Buster!

10:10.760 --> 10:13.640
- Almighty good grief.
- Delores, listen to me.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.560
- Out of my way!
- Empty the account.

10:15.640 --> 10:18.080
- Out of my way!
- Why are you crying? Why are you crying?

10:18.200 --> 10:20.520
<i>Out of my way!
Out! Out! Out!</i>

10:20.640 --> 10:23.560
Lindsay, take the wheel!
Buster, find us a channel to the ocean!

10:23.680 --> 10:25.400
Gee, I don't have any
mapping equipment with me.

10:25.480 --> 10:29.120
You've had $80,000 worth of cartography
lessons. Get us a channel to the ocean!

10:29.200 --> 10:31.400
Okay. Okay. Okay.

10:31.520 --> 10:32.529
- Can you hear me now?

10:32.530 --> 10:34.640
- Obviously this blue
part here is the land.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.320
That would mean...

10:37.440 --> 10:39.720
Oh, Buster, Buster.
You'll be all right.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.320
Shredder. No. Save it.
Save it. Shredder.

10:42.440 --> 10:45.360
Please don't leave us now,
Buster! Please!

10:45.480 --> 10:48.160
- Get in the tomb. The Aztec Tomb.
- Save it. Shred it.

10:48.240 --> 10:50.320
Hold on. I don't have time
for your magic tricks.

10:50.440 --> 10:53.160
Illusions, Dad! You don't
have time for my illusions!

10:53.280 --> 10:55.560
What is wrong with you?
Why are you so angry?

10:55.640 --> 10:58.200
Look. Just stay in the box.
I'll make you disappear.

10:58.280 --> 11:01.440
<i>The Bluth family
dominated the news that night.</i>

11:01.560 --> 11:04.200
Bluth Development Company
president George Bluth...

11:04.320 --> 11:07.360
was arrested tonight
for defrauding investors...

11:07.480 --> 11:10.760
<i>and using the company
as his personal piggy bank.</i>

11:10.840 --> 11:12.840
More intrigue
on the high seas tonight...

11:12.960 --> 11:15.280
as dozens of local pirates
were arrested...

11:15.400 --> 11:17.920
for protesting the yacht club's
discriminatory policies.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.800
<i>Even Michael's brother Gob made the news.</i>

11:19.880 --> 11:23.400
It was Mr. Bluth's son
Gob, a part-time magician...

11:23.520 --> 11:26.720
who hid his father here
in the Aztec Tomb.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.800
By pushing on this pivoting panel...

11:28.920 --> 11:31.800
I have to think the Alliance
is gonna frown on this.

11:31.880 --> 11:33.840
Perhaps a good trick for a human...

11:33.960 --> 11:36.400
but the dogs found him
almost instantly.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.600
<i>Free at last, darlings.</i>

11:38.720 --> 11:40.680
- I'm all right.
- Thank God.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.920
Oh, what an adventure.
Oh, my goodness!

11:43.040 --> 11:45.480
Buster! Don't do that.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.520
What an adventure, gang.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.040
I thought that
the homosexuals were pirates...

11:50.120 --> 11:53.720
but it turns out that most of them
were actors in the local theater.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.880
You're right though.
It is amazing.

11:57.960 --> 12:01.440
I've been waiting for the universe
to provide a path for me, and...

12:01.560 --> 12:03.640
and I think it has.

12:03.720 --> 12:06.320
- You're gay?
- No. No.

12:06.440 --> 12:10.960
I'm not... I'm not gay. No. Lindsay,
how many times must we have this...

12:11.080 --> 12:14.920
No. I want to be an actor.

12:18.760 --> 12:22.560
<i>Okay, guys. Um, they are gonna
keep Dad in prison...</i>

12:22.640 --> 12:24.840
at least until this gets all sorted out.

12:24.960 --> 12:26.780
Also, the attorney said
they're gonna have to

12:26.781 --> 12:28.560
put a halt on the
company's expense account.

12:30.360 --> 12:33.840
Interesting. I would have expected that
after the "keeping Dad in jail. "

12:33.960 --> 12:37.560
You know, Michael,
Dad did name Mom as his successor.

12:37.640 --> 12:41.120
- And I'm putting Buster in charge.
- That's a good choice.

12:41.240 --> 12:44.920
Buster? The guy who thought that
the blue on the map was land?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.880
- He's had business classes.
- Wa-Wa-Wa-Wait.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.360
Eighteenth-century agrarian business.

12:50.440 --> 12:53.320
But I guess it's all the same principles.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.520
Are you at all concerned
about an uprising?

12:55.640 --> 12:57.862
That's it. I'm done.
I'm sick and tired of

12:57.863 --> 13:00.240
the greed and the
selfishness and the taking.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.640
Forget it.
I've got a son to think about.

13:02.760 --> 13:05.400
And, Lindsay, by the way,
I expected this from them...

13:05.480 --> 13:07.320
because they're completely oblivious.

13:07.400 --> 13:10.680
But you...
you should know better.

13:10.760 --> 13:14.440
<i>In the days that followed,
Lindsay had no choice...</i>

13:14.560 --> 13:18.280
<i>but to check her family
out of the hotel earlier than planned.</i>

13:24.520 --> 13:26.440
<i>And her husband
started looking for work.</i>

13:26.560 --> 13:28.840
My name is Dr. Tobias Fünke.

13:28.920 --> 13:32.960
I was Chief Resident of Psychiatry
at Mass General for two years...

13:33.040 --> 13:36.360
and I did my fellowship
in psycholinguistics at M.I.T.

13:36.480 --> 13:40.640
<i>And this is "I'm a Bad, Bad Man"
from Annie Get Your Gun.</i>

13:47.400 --> 13:50.280
<i>Lucille was finding it
difficult to go about her daily life.</i>

13:50.400 --> 13:52.800
The S.E.C. is making him out
to be some kind of mastermind,

13:52.801 --> 13:54.120
which... believe me... he's not.

13:54.240 --> 13:56.720
The man can barely work our shredder.

13:56.840 --> 13:58.984
<i>Michael was able to
secure a job with a rival</i>

13:58.985 --> 14:00.560
housing company almost immediately.

14:00.680 --> 14:03.760
We'll set you up in Arizona
in one of our finest estates.

14:03.880 --> 14:07.120
Attic or main house?

14:10.880 --> 14:13.240
<i>And Buster was discovering
his academic pursuits...</i>

14:13.320 --> 14:15.560
<i>didn't fully prepare him
for his new responsibilities.</i>

14:15.680 --> 14:18.160
Have you looked at the latest figures
on the Sudden Valley expansion...

14:18.280 --> 14:20.400
vis-à-vis the development
versus the tax...

14:20.520 --> 14:24.120
<i>- You guys are so smart. - Two percent
per annum. This is a non-recoupable...</i>

14:24.200 --> 14:26.120
We need Michael.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.760
- We need ice.
- Michael. We need Michael.

14:29.880 --> 14:32.840
<i>And so the family
staged an intervention.</i>

14:32.960 --> 14:36.040
I'm sorry. What exactly
is this intervention for?

14:38.600 --> 14:41.080
<i>We need you to come back
and run the business.</i>

14:41.160 --> 14:44.005
Okay. So technically it's
not really an intervention.

14:44.006 --> 14:45.480
It's more of an imposition.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.160
- Whatever you want to call it.
- I'd love to call it an imposition.

14:48.280 --> 14:51.480
We're in trouble here, Michael.
And I can't perform my magic.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.960
I'm getting blackballed
from even the smaller venues.

14:54.080 --> 14:57.720
I'll be honest. I'm just more comfortable
with an Alliance-approved magician.

15:00.280 --> 15:03.240
Give 'em a hell of a show, champ.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.560
off, traitor.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.440
Can you believe this?
They're still fighting.

15:09.560 --> 15:13.960
Yeah, I know. I'm tempted to kiss again
so we could teach 'em a lesson.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.080
Why would that teach them a lesson?

15:16.200 --> 15:19.080
No, I mean, uh, to freak them out.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.880
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Isn't that what makes it funny?

15:21.960 --> 15:24.960
I'm laughing.
Go fish... Uno... Okay.

15:25.080 --> 15:27.760
- I just need a drink.
- Well, I'm sorry. It's just too late.

15:27.880 --> 15:30.000
I'm moving to Phoenix.
I got a job.

15:33.320 --> 15:36.720
Something you apply for,
and then they pay you to, uh...

15:36.840 --> 15:39.600
Never mind. I don't want to ruin
the surprise. So, no hard feelings.

15:39.720 --> 15:42.840
<i>Adios. Sayonara. I'll see you
when the first parent dies.</i>

15:42.920 --> 15:46.320
Well, I'd rather be dead in California
than alive in Arizona.

15:46.440 --> 15:49.000
<i>- Touché.
- George Michael, grab the coat.</i>

15:49.120 --> 15:51.280
I think Dad would really
want you to help us out here.

15:51.400 --> 15:55.720
- Dad's in jail. Here we go. - Well, the
least you could do is say good-bye to him.

15:55.840 --> 16:00.040
<i>In fact, Michael had not
spoken to his father since the arrest...</i>

16:00.120 --> 16:03.600
<i>and he decided to give his father
the courtesy of a formal resignation.</i>

16:03.720 --> 16:07.400
- I quit.
- Probably a good career move.

16:10.120 --> 16:13.080
You know, I parked in the same spot
for the last five years.

16:13.160 --> 16:15.720
I was there on time every single day.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.680
- Mike...
- I was so loyal. I worked so hard.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.960
- Why didn't you just put me in charge?
- Michael, listen to me.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.320
These guys, the S.E.C.,
they've been after me for years.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.160
I put you in charge, you're gonna
be wearing one of these jumpsuits too.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.760
- I could've helped...
- You'd be an accomplice.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.840
No. It had to be your mom.

16:33.600 --> 16:37.320
They cannot arrest
a husband and wife...

16:37.400 --> 16:39.600
for the same crime.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.600
Yeah, I don't think
that that's true, Dad.

16:44.680 --> 16:47.080
Really?

16:49.480 --> 16:51.720
I got the worst...
attorneys.

16:53.160 --> 16:54.960
<i>With Michael leaving town...</i>

16:55.080 --> 16:58.360
<i>Lindsay decided to take inventory
of the family's last remaining asset:</i>

16:58.440 --> 17:00.680
<i>their model home.</i>

17:02.120 --> 17:04.680
- What are you doing?
- Packing up. What are you doing?

17:04.800 --> 17:09.000
Well, just looking for... you.

17:09.079 --> 17:11.920
- To say good-bye to you.
- Gonna miss you guys.

17:12.040 --> 17:15.640
Oh, well. We'll come out
and see you in...

17:15.720 --> 17:18.160
Yeah. We'll miss you too.

17:18.280 --> 17:22.160
It's been nice having you guys around...
you know, to talk to.

17:22.280 --> 17:25.319
<i>Well, since Mom died,
it's been kind of lonely and...</i>

17:25.440 --> 17:28.440
I just wish
we could all stay here.

17:30.240 --> 17:32.600
- I... I need a hand with the van, please.
- Okay.

17:32.680 --> 17:34.520
Sorry.

17:53.040 --> 17:55.560
<i>Well, I-I guess he
really misses his family.</i>

17:55.680 --> 17:59.120
- Well, he doesn't know us very well.
- Yeah, clearly.

17:59.240 --> 18:02.760
Let me ask you a question. Where the hell
have you been? Why didn't you call me?

18:02.880 --> 18:05.160
Look at my life, Michael.

18:05.280 --> 18:09.040
Tobias is out of work.
We're in debt. It's...

18:13.800 --> 18:16.440
What are you doing?
Are you trying to cry?

18:16.520 --> 18:21.040
I'm sad. Life is hard right now.
I've got theJ.D.L. on my ass.

18:21.160 --> 18:24.600
- J.D.L.?
- Jewish Defense League.

18:24.680 --> 18:27.560
Oh, the circumcision thing?
This is why I was against HOOP.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.550
- Why didn't you just
mind your own business?

18:29.551 --> 18:30.920
- This is why I didn't call you!

18:31.040 --> 18:34.000
- You're so judgmental.
- No, I'm not judgmental.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.520
- And you're disappointed in me.
- I'm not disappointed in you.

18:36.640 --> 18:39.320
- You are.
- So I'm disappointed in you.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.960
But come on. What is not
disappointing about my life?

18:42.080 --> 18:45.400
Dad didn't give me the promotion.
Dad's in jail. How disappointing is that?

18:45.480 --> 18:46.622
- We're a disappointing family.

18:46.623 --> 18:48.280
- We're an incredibly
disappointing family.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.160
But we are a family,
and I want my son to be happy.

18:53.280 --> 18:57.720
So maybe we should be
in each other's lives.

18:57.800 --> 19:00.840
- I'd like that.
- Yeah?

19:04.000 --> 19:07.040
- Seriously, you're gonna pull a muscle.
- I used to be able to do this.

19:07.160 --> 19:09.480
<i>So Michael decided to
stay in California...</i>

19:09.560 --> 19:11.600
<i>and try to save the family business.</i>

19:11.720 --> 19:14.960
<i>And for the first time ever, he gathered
his family together in the model home.</i>

19:15.080 --> 19:17.207
- Dad was always banker,
so there was no beating him.

19:17.208 --> 19:17.759
- Totally.

19:17.760 --> 19:20.800
He should've been stocking up
on those "get out of jail free" cards.

19:20.920 --> 19:24.920
- Good one, George Michael!
- Very good.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.477
<i>- Two hundred for Short Line.</i>

19:26.478 --> 19:28.600
- I wish you guys didn't
have to go so soon.

19:28.680 --> 19:32.800
<i>Oh, on that subject, these guys
are actually gonna be staying with us.</i>

19:32.880 --> 19:36.360
For a while. Just your aunt
and her husband. Not Gob.

19:36.480 --> 19:39.240
- Really?
- Yeah. What the hell, huh? Family first.

19:39.320 --> 19:41.353
It is gonna be a little
crowded, so you're

19:41.354 --> 19:43.480
gonna have to share a
room with your cousin.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.560
<i>On the next Arrested Development...</i>

19:49.640 --> 19:51.680
<i>George Michael gets a new roommate.</i>

19:53.960 --> 19:56.240
It was really your brother
we were interested in.

19:56.360 --> 19:59.000
I mean, you don't even
have any references.

19:59.080 --> 20:02.080
<i>Is that enough
of a reference for you?</i>

20:02.200 --> 20:05.080
<i>And Michael finds it
difficult to get his father out of jail.</i>

20:05.160 --> 20:07.000
You love it here?

20:07.080 --> 20:09.920
Oh, I'm having the time of my life!

20:10.000 --> 20:11.840
Hey, T-Bone.
