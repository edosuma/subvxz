00:16.725 --> 00:17.768
He shot you?

00:19.061 --> 00:20.270
With a Judas bullet?

00:21.980 --> 00:22.981
Point blank.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.818
Honestly, I don't know
how I'm still standing.

00:29.112 --> 00:30.447
I'm lucky.

00:31.615 --> 00:32.741
Damn lucky.

00:33.492 --> 00:34.910
I think that second bath in the barn

00:34.993 --> 00:37.287
may have strengthened
the abalone shell on your skin.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.916
The Velcro effect is even tighter now.

00:40.999 --> 00:46.588
So you're saying I'm even more
indestructible than I was before?

00:47.631 --> 00:49.216
I think we need to test you.

00:54.972 --> 00:58.684
Wow, Bobby, when you said the Jets,
I thought you meant Jersey.

00:58.767 --> 00:59.977
Budget and timing, brother.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.395
Budget and timing.

01:01.478 --> 01:02.479
Hey, beautiful. Mmm.

01:03.814 --> 01:06.733
- This will be our lead story, right?
- I'm thinking it's the whole A-block.

01:06.817 --> 01:07.943
Did you invite the press?

01:08.527 --> 01:11.697
Hell, no, man.
They messin' with my exclusivity.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.532
It's that Harlem's Hero app.

01:13.615 --> 01:16.868
That guy you took a photo with
on the subway, he tagged you.

01:17.411 --> 01:21.081
Oh, there he is.
Hey, Todd.

01:21.707 --> 01:22.708
Hi.

01:23.292 --> 01:24.668
You're Luke Cage.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.295
And you're Todd Bowles.

01:26.378 --> 01:27.796
Good to meet you, Coach.

01:27.879 --> 01:29.840
- Sweet Christmas.
- Don't look at me, brother.

01:29.923 --> 01:33.427
I just do the man's taxes.
He wanted to see you up close.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.847
Jasmine, it's Michael. I'm with Jemele,
we're at a Harlem Jets practice.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.557
Todd Bowles just walked up.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.642
Bring in Shefter on this...

01:40.726 --> 01:43.812
Let's see what you're made of, Cage.
Let's go.

01:43.895 --> 01:47.190
Hey, Jemele, Luke Cage
is about to attempt the broad jump,

01:47.274 --> 01:49.735
and I'm telling you,
it's about to be sick.

01:52.321 --> 01:53.363
All right, Cage.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.240
Show me what you got.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.709
That thing weighs 400 pounds.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.169
I'm sorry, 400 pounds.

02:09.588 --> 02:12.633
That's 24 feet, Jemele. 24 feet!

02:12.716 --> 02:15.886
Eh, that's only 11 feet longer
than the world record in broad jump.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.097
Let's see what Cage got
in the 40. He comin', Deion.

02:19.181 --> 02:20.390
Three point 7-2.

02:21.391 --> 02:24.561
Whoo! Swear this dude's faster
than Usain Bolt.

02:24.645 --> 02:25.646
Are you serious?

02:25.729 --> 02:28.607
He handled a 400 pound tire
like it's nothing.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.692
Human beings
shouldn't be able to do that.

02:30.776 --> 02:33.654
I've seen a lot of workouts
in my day, but this is crazy.

02:33.737 --> 02:36.198
He is definitely going
on The Six tonight.

02:36.281 --> 02:40.160
If I'm a Nike, Adidas or Under Armour rep,
I'm doing a praise dance right now.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.703
- Dude is a gold mine.
- Preach.

02:42.788 --> 02:46.333
- How do you feel?
- Like it's good to be me.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.836
I'm sorry. I'm John Epps.
I'm a scout for Nike.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.798
I just...
I've never seen anything...

02:52.881 --> 02:54.383
I think the answer you're looking for

02:54.466 --> 02:57.010
involves a dollar sign
and three or four extra commas.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.554
- Come on, step into my office.
- Come on, come on.

03:04.309 --> 03:05.894
Right there, right there.

03:14.027 --> 03:17.197
What if there's something out there
worse than a Judas bullet?

03:20.367 --> 03:21.910
What if I can't help you?

03:23.078 --> 03:25.747
Nothing can hurt me. Okay?

03:27.791 --> 03:29.167
You made sure of that.

04:54.628 --> 04:59.841
Now is not the time
for alternative facts.

04:59.925 --> 05:03.553
I thought the Judas was the one thing
that could kill his ass.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.555
Maybe he's got some new armor
or some shit.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.307
Who are you again?

05:07.390 --> 05:08.600
Go.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.780
It's not even 9:30
in the morning.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.407
Do you think you wanna lay off?

05:26.159 --> 05:30.205
We cannot go legit
without Arturo's $20 mil.

05:31.081 --> 05:33.917
Like I said, flip the Basquiat.

05:34.417 --> 05:38.088
No. No. No.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.048
There's no reason
to sell the gun business.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.758
I am out.

05:42.342 --> 05:47.430
This shit took my mother,
it took my grandmother, my uncle.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.726
It took Cornell.

05:55.981 --> 05:58.149
What if Arturo's already talked
to the cops?

05:59.651 --> 06:03.446
It's not what they know,
it's what they can prove.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.865
And they can't prove shit.

06:06.992 --> 06:11.913
Comanche and I are gonna get
every dime of Arturo's money.

06:12.581 --> 06:16.876
And this weight is not yours
to carry alone, baby.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.672
This is what I'm here for.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.342
This is what I do.

06:34.644 --> 06:38.273
- You're on light duty, which means...
- Riding the pine.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.233
The job's not always jumping out hot.

06:40.317 --> 06:43.612
- You know that.
- Yeah, but I've always been a starter.

06:43.695 --> 06:46.239
- Not always.
- Nandi.

06:49.534 --> 06:50.994
Same academy class?

06:51.077 --> 06:55.290
Misty was a year behind me
at DeWitt Clinton. Both varsity.

06:55.373 --> 06:58.209
She took my spot when I twisted my knee.

06:58.293 --> 07:01.004
- I earned... my spot.
- Mm.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.548
And never gave it back.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.885
She was nice with hers. I'll admit.

07:06.968 --> 07:11.681
Eyes in the back of her head and
a sick crossover with handles like a...

07:12.724 --> 07:14.893
I'm so sorry. I... I wasn't thinking.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.269
You and me both.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.397
Look, I'm still trying
to wrap my head around it.

07:19.481 --> 07:23.693
But since you're feeling all guilty
and shit, I would like my desk back.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.863
- There's another desk right over there.
- Mine will do just fine.

07:28.698 --> 07:29.783
Hey, Misty.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.577
Welcome back.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.080
Hey. Congratulations on the promotion.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.999
- Well-deserved. Yeah.
- Thank you very much.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.752
Hey, partner.
We've got Arturo Rey III on ice.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.212
Let's go melt him, then.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.465
- Captain?
- Interrogation 1. He's all yours.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.886
Detective Knight, if you will.

08:03.066 --> 08:06.069
I wasn't kidding, Detective.
You're on light duty.

08:06.152 --> 08:09.739
He's not gonna talk to them.
He can sense the green on both of 'em.

08:09.823 --> 08:15.537
Look, let me in there.
I lost my arm, not my damn nerve.

08:15.620 --> 08:16.621
No.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.130
- Mi Luke Cage.
- No, mi Luke Cage.

09:07.213 --> 09:11.176
You can't burn me. You can't break me.
I'm invincible. Mi Luke Cage.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.262
Hey, now. Luke Cage? Who's that?

09:14.345 --> 09:15.972
Go on, show him.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.601
<i>I'm Luke Cage.</i>

09:19.684 --> 09:24.272
<i>You can't burn me. You can't blast me.
And you definitely can't break me.</i>

09:24.355 --> 09:27.400
<i>You want to test me?
Step up. I'm right here.</i>

09:27.484 --> 09:29.110
You want me to test you?

09:29.819 --> 09:31.613
Just tell him not to test me.

09:31.696 --> 09:32.989
You hear me?

09:33.073 --> 09:35.617
Easy.

10:15.490 --> 10:18.493
- What are you doing here?
- I came in for a shape up.

10:19.577 --> 10:22.205
You know how hard it is
to maintain a baldy.

10:25.917 --> 10:29.045
- Can you cut me?
- Oh, no. I'm not a barber, brother.

10:29.129 --> 10:33.216
And there's no one here at the moment,
and we're... we're moving location.

10:33.299 --> 10:36.219
You know, you just could have gone
to Denny Moe's on Frederick Douglass.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.428
They're open.

10:37.512 --> 10:38.888
Thanks for the tip.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.563
Come by and see me sometime, Carl.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.399
You know my name, Dad.

11:02.620 --> 11:03.872
Uh...

11:04.455 --> 11:06.291
- You look alike.
- No, we don't.

11:06.374 --> 11:07.625
Well, I don't mean in skin tone.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.587
But that swagger, you got it
from somewhere, like it or not.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.883
Ooh. Brother, you are trending on Twitter.

11:14.966 --> 11:18.720
Like the youngsters say,
you about to get pizaid for rizeal.

11:18.803 --> 11:21.097
That kind of money comes with strings.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.807
I don't need no leash.

11:22.891 --> 11:24.183
Hey, guys.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.518
Hey, Claire.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.647
What happened? What's wrong?

11:31.232 --> 11:34.402
- My father's in town.
- That's great.

11:34.986 --> 11:37.196
- He was here?
- Yeah, he just left.

11:38.740 --> 11:39.741
How'd it go?

11:40.366 --> 11:41.993
We have nothing to talk about.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.495
He's your family.

11:45.079 --> 11:46.205
Family?

11:46.289 --> 11:49.834
All that means is low expectations,
disappointment and death.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.545
Um...

11:52.629 --> 11:54.047
I thought we were family.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.424
Or getting there.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.722
- You know what I mean.
- I don't.

12:03.723 --> 12:08.186
I'd be ecstatic if the father who thought
he lost me was reaching out to me.

12:08.269 --> 12:12.440
We're different, Claire. Okay?
'Cause he lost me a long time ago.

12:13.608 --> 12:16.027
Breaking an olive branch is
not an act of bravery.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.655
Why are you constantly questioning
my bravery?

12:27.038 --> 12:32.377
I appreciate your concern,
but I will deal with him when I am ready.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.006
I was angry with my father, too.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.970
And he died
before I could make amends with him.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.266
I don't want you to make
the same mistake I did.

12:52.355 --> 12:53.272
How did it go?

12:53.356 --> 12:56.484
What are you doing here
messing up our investigation?

12:56.567 --> 12:58.361
What is your problem, Nandi?

12:58.444 --> 13:02.282
Everyone knows you're a hero, Misty.
The legend.

13:02.365 --> 13:05.326
- You're Jordan playing for the Wizards.
- But he's still Jordan.

13:05.410 --> 13:10.081
You got your pension.
The mayor knows your name.

13:10.873 --> 13:14.168
What? You don't have enough people
feeling sorry for you?

13:17.422 --> 13:18.423
Misty.

13:20.425 --> 13:23.761
We're friends,
but I'll always tell you the truth.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.806
Your injury
makes people feel uncomfortable.

13:27.765 --> 13:31.436
And there are still plenty of people
that are ticked off about what Scarfe did.

13:34.897 --> 13:37.400
But you're not one of those people, right?

13:38.026 --> 13:39.027
No.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.114
I know that look, Misty.

13:44.782 --> 13:45.783
What?

13:46.534 --> 13:50.246
I am not gonna go and talk to Arturo.
He's lawyered up.

13:50.329 --> 13:52.957
It would be against the rules.

13:53.041 --> 13:56.335
'Cause you're all about the rules. Right?

14:07.930 --> 14:11.476
Who are you supposed to be?
The short arm of the law?

14:11.559 --> 14:13.936
That's good.

14:14.937 --> 14:18.900
We got you dead to rights
on a Judas bullet charge. Federal.

14:18.983 --> 14:22.195
You know what you get
when you get caught in possession

14:22.278 --> 14:24.781
of weaponry related to the incident?

14:25.698 --> 14:28.326
It's like being caught
with a nuclear weapon.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.745
You could end up in a black site.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.415
Look, we both know
Mariah Dillard is your connect.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.085
Why protect her?

14:38.836 --> 14:40.755
You're a businessman, right?

14:41.672 --> 14:46.761
Cut a deal. Spend a cushy five at Club Fed

14:46.844 --> 14:49.847
instead of hard life at the ADX.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.229
Detective.

14:57.772 --> 15:00.233
As always, I find your charm disarming.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.902
- This interview stops now.
- Like hell it does.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.655
Your client got caught with a...

15:05.738 --> 15:09.492
Caught by whom?
Luke Cage? A known vigilante.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.952
It was a citizen's arrest.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.621
After assaulting
and apprehending my client,

15:13.704 --> 15:15.498
did Mr. Cage bother
to read him his rights?

15:15.581 --> 15:18.626
No matter what,
we got him on a Judas bullet charge.

15:18.709 --> 15:22.505
Regardless, my client has made bail.
He walks right now.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.466
See you in court.
If it even goes that far.

15:26.092 --> 15:29.262
You need a hand uncuffing my client?

15:47.864 --> 15:51.993
Talking without authorization to a perp
after he's already lawyered up?

15:52.076 --> 15:55.830
You are this close to being suspended.
I hope it was worth it.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.631
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Luke, it's me.

16:06.883 --> 16:09.635
Ben Donovan just sprung Arturo Rey.

16:09.719 --> 16:10.720
Shit.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.805
Look, I wish there was
something I could do,

16:12.889 --> 16:16.392
but Mariah's favorite lawyer is
just too damn slick.

16:16.476 --> 16:19.187
<i>- Okay, thanks for letting me know.</i>
- You got it.

16:21.022 --> 16:23.649
You cursed, brother.
Pop's rules still apply.

16:23.733 --> 16:24.734
I ran out of change.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.653
Arturo Rey shot you with a Judas bullet.

16:27.737 --> 16:30.072
Even if he makes bail,
he's gonna eventually go down.

16:30.156 --> 16:33.075
Maybe, but the product is still out there.
He's gotta go.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.286
No way Mariah can sell to him now.
He's too hot.

16:35.369 --> 16:38.206
Those guns won't hit the streets
of Harlem. That's a win, right?

16:39.874 --> 16:45.004
Well, if Mariah can't sell to Arturo Rey,
will she move on to one of these two cats?

16:45.087 --> 16:46.088
Absolutely.

16:46.797 --> 16:49.842
Money is like nature.
It always finds a way.

16:49.926 --> 16:52.678
Look, I don't know
about this Jamaican cat,

16:52.762 --> 16:54.889
but if what y'all told me
about Cockroach is true,

16:54.972 --> 16:56.474
giving him control of Hammer weapons

16:56.557 --> 16:58.851
is like giving a Crip or a Blood
a suitcase nuke.

16:58.935 --> 17:03.356
Well, Nigel and Cockroach
are both connected to Mariah and the guns.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.442
All you need is one of them to talk.

17:09.153 --> 17:11.280
- Where you going?
- To fumigate.

17:13.241 --> 17:15.535
I don't know where Cockroach is, man!
I don't!

17:17.828 --> 17:20.039
I don't!
On my mama! I wouldn't lie to you, man!

17:24.335 --> 17:26.127
Heard your mama's a liar, too.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.762
Where's Cockroach?

17:36.722 --> 17:38.808
No one's seen him
since he went to Harlem's Paradise.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.935
- He got any people?
- His baby mama.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.520
She got a name?

17:51.529 --> 17:52.822
Powell. Drea Powell.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.745
Yo! Yo, are you gonna leave me like this?

18:00.413 --> 18:01.414
Yup.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.635
You shouldn't be here.

18:15.386 --> 18:16.679
You should have never come back.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.180
I've come to see my family.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.683
The man who saved my life.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.019
You gave me power.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.063
Your power doesn't come from me.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.232
It comes from within.

18:31.485 --> 18:34.989
Anyway, you know,
we're all right and everything's fine.

18:36.115 --> 18:40.286
- You've come for the family you lost.
- Come on. You did, too.

18:41.579 --> 18:43.664
This restaurant is named after my mom.

18:46.917 --> 18:47.918
She was a good woman.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.172
It was a long time ago.

18:53.507 --> 18:54.759
But not for me.

18:58.054 --> 19:02.850
I must bring Mariah Stokes to her knees.
Burn everything down, yeah?

19:02.933 --> 19:08.314
Maybe she's smart enough to walk away,
like you should.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.857
Coward.

19:14.362 --> 19:15.946
You been at it again?

19:19.825 --> 19:21.410
I need more nightshade.

19:22.453 --> 19:24.538
The more you use, the more it hurts.

19:25.414 --> 19:28.417
Nightshade works like a steroid, you know?

19:33.464 --> 19:34.965
I know a place in Harlem.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.134
<i>In sports today,</i>

19:37.218 --> 19:42.515
<i>Luke Cage put on quite a display on
the field as he ran a 40 in 3.72 seconds.</i>

19:42.598 --> 19:45.267
<i>- That's faster than Usain Bolt.</i>
- Luke Cage.

19:46.394 --> 19:48.729
Now he's disrespecting Usain Bolt?

19:50.272 --> 19:53.526
- He protects Harlem for the Stokes?
- The opposite.

19:54.068 --> 19:57.446
- They call him the Hero of Harlem. Hmm.
- Hero?

19:57.530 --> 19:59.240
I would break the fool.

19:59.323 --> 20:02.618
He won't trouble you.
He'll only fight against Mariah.

20:02.702 --> 20:06.372
- What makes you want trouble with Cage?
- Harlem's my birthright.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.793
The people are calling Luke Cage's name.
I can't have that.

20:12.670 --> 20:17.341
Mariah has the crown, but he has
their heart. I need both of them. Simple.

20:17.425 --> 20:20.094
- Hmm. Easier said than done.
- Mmm.

20:20.177 --> 20:23.848
Luke Cage is a hard man to kill.
No bullet can kill him.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.018
I don't have to use a bullet. Understand?

20:32.273 --> 20:33.274
What do you mean,

20:33.357 --> 20:36.026
numbers are down for
the Family First Initiative fundraiser?

20:36.110 --> 20:39.238
The scandal and controversy
around your cousin

20:39.321 --> 20:41.907
has affected opinions about you.

20:42.491 --> 20:47.079
What? Should I give away turkeys
like Nicky Barnes did when I was a kid?

20:47.163 --> 20:50.040
Mmm-mmm.
What's your daughter, Tilda, doing?

20:50.124 --> 20:52.626
She's a doctor, right?

20:53.210 --> 20:56.964
Following in the steps
of her late father, Dr. Jackson Dillard.

20:58.007 --> 21:00.468
You haven't been seen publicly with her

21:00.551 --> 21:03.095
since your first campaign run
12 years ago.

21:03.637 --> 21:04.555
What happened?

21:07.725 --> 21:09.643
I have no idea where she is.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.188
Don't lie to me.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.941
You hired the best.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.152
I'm the best.

21:18.736 --> 21:22.323
She just opened a holistic boutique
on Lenox.

21:22.406 --> 21:25.951
You know our people.
Everyone loves a family reunion.

21:26.035 --> 21:27.620
We play it as,

21:27.703 --> 21:32.708
"Mariah Dillard, promising black
female politician on the rise,

21:32.792 --> 21:36.796
felled by tragedy and controversy,
hits rock bottom.

21:36.879 --> 21:41.258
Then, at her lowest point,
she reunites with her child."

21:41.342 --> 21:43.344
Your renewed relationship
with your daughter

21:43.427 --> 21:46.764
gives you the strength
and the drive to do better.

21:47.348 --> 21:48.766
With your daughter by your side,

21:48.849 --> 21:54.146
you come out looking as warm,
yet powerful, as Michelle.

22:00.110 --> 22:01.403
Mama Harlem.

22:02.279 --> 22:05.115
You see it, right?

22:12.456 --> 22:13.457
"Go."

22:15.459 --> 22:17.086
Like I'm some damn dog.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.592
You, you... You don't say a word.

22:25.511 --> 22:29.515
By the way, what's up with all this
<i>American Gigolo</i> shit you on, man?

22:35.396 --> 22:37.773
I ain't making no judgments, all right?

22:42.653 --> 22:44.446
Look, you get in where you fit in.

22:45.739 --> 22:46.740
Literally.

22:48.617 --> 22:52.580
I just wish Rackham had picked us
for that experimental shit, you know?

22:52.663 --> 22:55.583
Think about all the shit we'd be running
if we were bulletproof.

22:55.666 --> 22:58.961
- We'd be unstoppable.
- Stop talking. We're here.

23:09.805 --> 23:11.307
What are you doing in my store?

23:11.390 --> 23:12.641
Our lawyer got you out,

23:12.725 --> 23:15.227
and a judge we control
allowed us to bail you out.

23:15.311 --> 23:18.022
You should show me a little more respect.

23:18.105 --> 23:21.900
You and the defective Judas bullet
is why I was even locked up.

23:22.568 --> 23:24.069
You and Mariah set me up.

23:24.153 --> 23:28.324
Why would we set you up?
You're our customer.

23:29.366 --> 23:33.329
- Not anymore, I'm not.
- What? We had a deal.

23:34.330 --> 23:35.998
You said you got a judge.

23:36.081 --> 23:37.666
I'll give you your money,

23:37.750 --> 23:39.543
when I get off free and clear.

23:39.627 --> 23:43.297
Or I'll go back to that one-armed
detective and tell her what I know.

23:43.881 --> 23:46.717
She's got a hard-on
for that old bitch of yours.

23:46.800 --> 23:50.179
Oh, you don't like me
saying that. Oh.

24:07.321 --> 24:10.199
Damn, my nigga.
That pussy must be ridiculous.

24:10.282 --> 24:13.452
What the hell were you thinking?
How y'all gonna get the money now?

24:14.662 --> 24:15.579
Let's go.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.085
Now.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.045
Grab the surveillance tapes.

24:47.486 --> 24:48.445
Need a hand?

25:03.293 --> 25:04.294
Okay.

25:06.338 --> 25:08.882
Everybody take a good look.

25:11.635 --> 25:12.845
I lost an arm.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.889
This is who I am now.

25:16.682 --> 25:20.936
Now, it doesn't mean
I need your pity or your jokes.

25:21.812 --> 25:25.774
Or you staring at me while I'm trying
to do my goddamn job.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.609
Take a good look.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.739
We good?

25:33.907 --> 25:35.576
Let's get back to work.

25:40.205 --> 25:42.166
Bailey! Tyler!

25:44.418 --> 25:45.711
Arturo Rey is dead.

25:45.794 --> 25:49.882
He was found in his furniture store
a few minutes ago. Bullet to head.

26:29.171 --> 26:30.923
<i>What are you doing in my store?</i>

26:35.594 --> 26:37.137
S <i>how me
a little more respect.</i>

27:01.787 --> 27:04.623
Come on, Misty.
What the hell are you doing here?

27:04.706 --> 27:07.584
You can't be here.
You know that. Go home.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.213
What'd you do? Run here?

27:11.296 --> 27:14.633
Thanks for calling me.
I can't believe they already killed him.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.260
Mariah and Shades?

27:16.343 --> 27:19.388
That's what my gut tells me,
but no fingerprints,

27:19.471 --> 27:20.973
the tape from the camera is gone,

27:21.056 --> 27:25.769
and with Arturo Rey III dead,
who knows when we'll get another chance?

27:28.730 --> 27:29.982
What about him?

27:31.066 --> 27:32.234
Cockroach?

27:33.026 --> 27:35.112
You think he's connected to Mariah?

27:35.195 --> 27:37.865
He's her next gun buyer.
He's ghost right now.

27:37.948 --> 27:41.702
Only lead I've gotten
is his old girlfriend, Drea Powell.

27:47.165 --> 27:50.794
Dawn, I need you to get me an address.

27:51.461 --> 27:52.588
Drea Powell.

27:53.505 --> 27:56.300
Just text me everything
you find on her. Thanks.

27:58.677 --> 28:02.389
How are you doing with everything else?

28:05.601 --> 28:09.104
I'd be a lot better if people
stopped asking me that question.

28:10.981 --> 28:13.108
I've got an address on Drea Powell,

28:13.191 --> 28:16.987
and it looks like it's the last place
we arrested him at.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.698
Seven-fifteen 147th.

28:24.953 --> 28:27.623
Baby, I can't thank you enough
for your help.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.958
I've been suffering
with these headaches for weeks,

28:30.042 --> 28:33.211
and nothing I tried helped
until I came to you.

28:33.295 --> 28:37.424
That stuff made me feel better
as quick as I took it. What you put in it?

28:37.507 --> 28:40.636
Just a mix of oils, peppermint,
lavender and basil.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.263
No, no. Free of charge.

28:44.306 --> 28:46.391
The last two didn't work.

28:46.475 --> 28:49.353
I am just happy
that we found a mixture that did.

28:50.145 --> 28:52.940
I'm gonna tell everyone I know
to come to you.

28:53.523 --> 28:55.442
That means so much.
Thank you.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.280
- Good day.
- Hello.

29:13.794 --> 29:15.337
What, baby?

29:17.506 --> 29:18.799
I'm waiting...

29:20.467 --> 29:23.971
on the "you've thrown your life away,
Tilda" speech.

29:25.389 --> 29:29.101
Telling me I wasted $200,000
on medical school,

29:29.184 --> 29:32.062
wasted my time and my talent,

29:32.145 --> 29:35.983
only to end up working in a shop
peddling snake oil.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.611
It's anthroposophic medicine.

29:40.279 --> 29:45.742
An approach designed to stimulate
a patient's power of self-healing.

29:46.535 --> 29:48.161
I think it suits you.

29:50.706 --> 29:55.919
My only quibble is, why you would
name this place Mother's Touch?

29:56.003 --> 29:57.629
There are studies that show

29:58.171 --> 30:00.632
mothers have healing effects
on their sick children.

30:02.718 --> 30:04.219
When they care.

30:05.846 --> 30:07.514
I suppose I had that coming.

30:10.559 --> 30:13.979
Look, um, it's not my birthday,

30:14.062 --> 30:19.568
and there's no funeral or holiday,
so what are you doing here, Mariah?

30:21.320 --> 30:24.865
I'm your mother.
You don't call me by my first name.

30:26.033 --> 30:27.659
Respect me.

30:30.078 --> 30:31.580
What do you need from me?

30:33.457 --> 30:34.458
You.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.085
I need you.

30:37.627 --> 30:39.546
I don't have a time machine, Tilda.

30:39.629 --> 30:43.091
I just have me, right now.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.386
And I'm here asking you
for a second chance.

30:46.970 --> 30:49.431
Whatever's happened between us,
I want to put it behind us.

30:49.514 --> 30:50.849
We start over.

30:51.933 --> 30:54.978
I can be the mother
you always wanted me to be.

30:57.022 --> 31:00.859
I know somewhere
there is another shoe ready to drop.

31:01.485 --> 31:02.486
I know you.

31:03.987 --> 31:06.073
Good night, Mother.

31:07.866 --> 31:08.867
Not "Mommy"?

31:13.622 --> 31:15.457
I respect your boundaries.

31:16.666 --> 31:18.585
You know where I'll be.

31:24.257 --> 31:26.301
I do love you, T.

31:39.314 --> 31:42.109
- Whoa. You're Luke Cage.
- I am.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.069
How are you, young man?

31:48.323 --> 31:49.658
Did your old man give you that?

31:53.370 --> 31:55.247
He was beating up my moms.

31:55.330 --> 31:59.167
I tried to stop him,
but I ain't strong like you.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.461
You're plenty strong, kid.

32:02.379 --> 32:05.257
- Do you know where he is now?
- Who are you talking to?

32:06.341 --> 32:08.510
Go to your room. Now!

32:09.302 --> 32:13.265
Miss, I'm not here to cause any trouble.
I just need to know where Dontrell is.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.273
Psst.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.071
- You looking for Dontrell, ain't you?
- I am.

32:28.155 --> 32:30.240
He's always beating on that poor girl.

32:30.323 --> 32:33.326
- And her boy.
- Do you know where I can find him?

32:33.410 --> 32:37.080
He runs a dice game
over at them warehouses.

32:37.164 --> 32:39.458
- Thanks.
- Oh, wait.

32:41.001 --> 32:44.171
Give me your number.
I see him, I'll call you.

32:45.422 --> 32:47.382
I might just call you anyway.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.428
You, uh, want some coffee?

32:51.511 --> 32:56.892
No, thanks.
I gotta run. Here you go.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.144
If you find him, I hope you beat his ass.

33:00.437 --> 33:01.980
You have a blessed day.

33:02.522 --> 33:03.482
Thanks.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.119
We have a problem.

33:17.287 --> 33:18.413
What's going on?

33:18.497 --> 33:21.166
We had to end our negotiations
with Arturo.

33:21.249 --> 33:22.876
What do you mean, "end"?

33:26.880 --> 33:29.007
What? Why?

33:29.090 --> 33:32.344
He was talking <i>puta</i> or some shit,
so he had to go <i>adiรณs.</i>

33:32.427 --> 33:33.845
Did you get the money?

33:35.013 --> 33:37.474
Why did you kill him
before you got the money?

33:37.557 --> 33:39.601
What the hell were you thinking about?

33:39.684 --> 33:40.685
You.

33:41.394 --> 33:42.395
Us.

33:43.021 --> 33:47.526
Arturo threatened to talk to Misty Knight.
Comanche's right. He had to go.

33:47.609 --> 33:50.445
We need that cash. I have nothing.

33:50.529 --> 33:53.782
You have nothing? Seriously?

33:53.865 --> 33:57.994
You still got two other buyers plus that
boss-ass painting hanging up in the club.

33:58.745 --> 33:59.996
Shit ain't hard to figure out.

34:00.872 --> 34:01.873
Leave.

34:02.541 --> 34:03.500
Again.

34:08.964 --> 34:12.132
I am going to break my foot off
in his ass one day,

34:12.217 --> 34:13.885
and I don't care if he ain't got a neck.

34:13.969 --> 34:16.054
I'll handle Comanche.

34:16.679 --> 34:19.056
But Che's right. We still have two buyers.

34:19.139 --> 34:21.935
Who? Cockroach and Nigel?

34:22.018 --> 34:25.397
The first is too impulsive.
The latter too ambitious.

34:25.480 --> 34:29.359
- Neither one is a good option.
- I messed up. I admit it.

34:30.860 --> 34:35.532
But I couldn't let Arturo snitch,
or do anything to bring you down.

34:35.614 --> 34:37.993
I'm gonna get our money
to Piranha on time.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.328
I promise you that.

35:52.192 --> 35:55.070
Anybody else wanna gamble tonight?

36:00.075 --> 36:01.910
Where you think you're going?

36:03.036 --> 36:04.621
Oh.

36:06.206 --> 36:07.624
I don't know what you heard.

36:07.707 --> 36:11.419
You think I'm gonna let you take Mariah's
guns and turn Harlem into a war zone?

36:17.550 --> 36:20.261
Think that's gonna help you?

36:22.097 --> 36:23.223
Actually...

36:25.016 --> 36:26.017
yeah.

37:01.177 --> 37:02.220
Yeah.

37:02.971 --> 37:04.806
Okay, well, the numbers look good.

37:04.889 --> 37:08.393
Look, I'm gonna run these by Luke
and our lawyer, and we'll get back to you.

37:08.476 --> 37:09.477
Talk soon.

37:10.478 --> 37:12.355
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:12.897 --> 37:15.191
- Who was that?
- Nike rep.

37:16.276 --> 37:19.404
You won't believe
what I'm talking these cats into.

37:19.487 --> 37:23.241
Luke might be bulletproof,
but he leads with his heart and his chin.

37:23.324 --> 37:24.534
I'm here to protect him.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.244
You're a good man, Bobby.

37:26.327 --> 37:29.789
I'll still take my 10%, no more, no less,
like a good manager should.

37:34.794 --> 37:36.504
What's on your mind, Claire?

37:39.048 --> 37:41.342
I want to protect Luke, too.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.636
I just don't know how. I...

37:44.429 --> 37:47.599
I mean, he's the man I want to be with.
There's no doubt in my mind.

37:47.682 --> 37:50.059
But he's not whole.

37:51.352 --> 37:54.522
- He won't reconcile his past...
- You mean his father?

37:55.398 --> 37:57.400
I've been here. It doesn't work.

37:59.194 --> 38:00.862
For what it's worth, Claire,

38:01.654 --> 38:04.365
sometimes you gotta let a man
heal on his own.

38:04.449 --> 38:07.202
Just be his woman and not his mother.

38:07.285 --> 38:10.830
Parenthood can be complicated,
especially when they're grown.

38:10.914 --> 38:13.041
Sou sound like you're speaking
from experience.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.125
Oh, I am.

38:14.209 --> 38:17.170
- Son or a daughter?
- Daughter.

38:18.379 --> 38:21.382
And I used to be quite the player
back in my day.

38:21.466 --> 38:24.719
Cool Daddy Smooth.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.846
At least in my mind, I was.

38:27.680 --> 38:30.517
A beautiful daughter is God's revenge.

38:35.939 --> 38:37.816
Speak of the devil.

38:37.899 --> 38:38.900
Hey, baby.

38:40.485 --> 38:41.486
What?

38:43.071 --> 38:44.280
I gotta go.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.912
Force of the blast took my shoulder out.
Blew me right out the window.

38:50.995 --> 38:54.332
- And you couldn't get it back in?
- Couldn't get leverage.

38:54.415 --> 38:57.544
Yeah, that <i>Lethal Weapon</i> shit
only works in the movies.

39:16.521 --> 39:20.191
- I hate to say that I told you so...
- Don't lecture me, Claire.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.236
You're not invulnerable, Luke.

39:23.319 --> 39:26.030
Matt wasn't, and neither are you.

39:26.114 --> 39:28.116
Matt was nothing like me, okay?

39:28.199 --> 39:30.368
You are more like Matt
than you want to admit.

39:30.451 --> 39:31.703
Trust me, I know.

39:31.786 --> 39:32.996
Of course you do.

39:34.581 --> 39:38.209
Because you're always running around,
falling in with people with abilities.

39:38.293 --> 39:42.505
Yeah. Jessica, Danny, Matt, me.

39:43.548 --> 39:46.092
No matter who,
how are you always involved...

39:46.175 --> 39:48.261
Stop it! You're not mad at me.

39:48.344 --> 39:49.512
I'm not mad at anyone.

39:49.596 --> 39:53.558
All those red X's, you're obsessed. And
it's not just with Mariah. Your father...

39:53.641 --> 39:56.519
- Why do you keep coming back to him?
- Because you won't.

39:57.103 --> 40:02.525
- He hurt you. And he hurt your mother.
- Look, lies have ripple effects, Claire.

40:02.609 --> 40:04.527
He lied to me and Willis our whole lives.

40:04.611 --> 40:07.155
That's how Willis became Diamondback
and framed me.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.823
That's why I went to Seagate.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.992
And I know Reva isn't blameless.

40:11.075 --> 40:14.412
If she hadn't helped me disappear
and stolen the data from Dr. Burstein,

40:14.495 --> 40:18.041
we wouldn't have ended up in New York,
Kilgrave might have never found her.

40:18.124 --> 40:21.044
I would have never met Pop.
And they both would still be alive.

40:23.463 --> 40:25.006
And all that's done now.

40:26.799 --> 40:29.218
And you got your name and your life back.

40:29.302 --> 40:32.847
But this wound with your father
is another Judas bullet.

40:32.931 --> 40:35.058
And if you remove it, you heal yourself.

40:35.141 --> 40:39.354
But if you don't, it is slowly killing
who you are from the inside,

40:39.437 --> 40:42.273
and you're... too close to see it.

40:44.692 --> 40:47.028
- You wanna help me, Claire?
- Yes.

40:47.111 --> 40:49.656
Then stay out of my goddamn head.

41:07.715 --> 41:09.133
May I help you?

41:10.009 --> 41:12.679
I heard you're the woman to see
for the items I need.

41:23.523 --> 41:24.524
Is there a problem?

41:26.442 --> 41:27.819
This stuff is used for Obeah.

41:27.902 --> 41:30.613
Gimme what I want
and I'll leave. Understand?

42:06.899 --> 42:08.693
That's far too much.

42:08.776 --> 42:11.738
Well, you've been so generous and helpful.

42:14.073 --> 42:15.074
I'm gone.

44:00.638 --> 44:01.973
Jamaicans reached out.

44:02.056 --> 44:04.142
- They got the cash.
- Nigel?

44:04.225 --> 44:05.560
Some other Yardie.

44:05.643 --> 44:07.687
Can't understand a word
these guys say half the time.

44:07.770 --> 44:09.730
- What about Cockroach?
- Forget Cockroach.

44:09.814 --> 44:12.316
The Jamaicans'll never give us
what Arturo was gonna pay.

44:12.400 --> 44:15.111
It's enough to get us clean.
We'll make up the rest.

44:51.939 --> 44:54.734
Hey. I'm sorry, baby girl,
but you're in the wrong section.

44:54.817 --> 44:56.652
I'm here to talk to my mother.

44:57.737 --> 44:58.738
Sweetie.

45:00.072 --> 45:01.449
What are you doing here?

45:02.408 --> 45:03.409
Your pain.

45:04.201 --> 45:05.286
It's real.

45:08.915 --> 45:12.126
You have one more chance, Mommy.

45:13.711 --> 45:16.464
One chance is all I need.

45:21.469 --> 45:22.553
So, she's with you?

45:23.304 --> 45:24.388
Yes.

45:25.014 --> 45:27.141
Hernan and...

45:27.224 --> 45:28.392
Darius.

45:28.476 --> 45:32.188
Tilda.

45:34.857 --> 45:36.400
What a pleasure.

45:39.528 --> 45:41.822
Could you give us a moment?

45:46.160 --> 45:47.286
Of course.

45:52.041 --> 45:53.501
Come on. Sit, sit.

45:55.544 --> 45:57.088
Whoo.

45:57.171 --> 45:58.339
Wow.

46:19.568 --> 46:21.821
Baby girl just took your slot, son.

46:56.772 --> 47:01.360
<i>"'Vengeance is mine, '
sayeth the Lord."</i>

47:02.069 --> 47:05.031
<i>Romans 12:19.</i>

47:06.157 --> 47:07.575
Why is that?

47:08.701 --> 47:11.078
Let's look at the first part
of that verse.

47:11.162 --> 47:14.915
"Dearly beloved, avenge not yourself,

47:14.999 --> 47:18.586
but leave room for the wrath of God."

47:19.795 --> 47:24.675
<i>Well, now, God trusts us with so much.</i>

47:24.759 --> 47:26.761
<i>Why not wrath?</i>

47:26.844 --> 47:30.181
<i>It's because wrath is toxic.</i>

47:30.264 --> 47:32.349
<i>The soul can't tolerate it.</i>

47:32.433 --> 47:35.519
<i>And it only takes a few drops.
Oh, yeah, a little dab'll do ya.</i>

47:35.603 --> 47:37.188
<i>It poisons you.</i>

47:37.897 --> 47:41.108
And there will be times
when you are tested.

47:45.362 --> 47:47.406
Times when your blood boils.

47:48.365 --> 47:51.869
But vengeance belongs to the Lord.

47:53.079 --> 47:54.914
<i>Vengeance belongs to the Lord</i>

47:54.997 --> 47:58.834
<i>because sometimes,
whether we want to admit it or not,</i>

47:58.918 --> 48:00.961
Father does know best.

48:02.671 --> 48:05.091
I'm reminded of an old Cherokee legend.

48:05.174 --> 48:08.594
Think I'm playing with you, bitch, huh?
I will kill you!

48:08.677 --> 48:11.180
I know you snitched me out to Luke Cage!

48:11.263 --> 48:15.768
Grandson comes to his grandfather.
Now, the little boy is angry.

48:15.851 --> 48:19.105
One of his little friends
has done him a great injury.

48:19.188 --> 48:22.274
And the little boy wants some retribution.

48:22.858 --> 48:25.528
That little boy wants some vengeance.

48:25.611 --> 48:28.280
<i>Now, the grandfather,
he understood the grandson.</i>

48:29.031 --> 48:34.411
<i>Mmm-hmm. He understood that it's our
nature to hate those who have harmed us,</i>

48:34.495 --> 48:36.705
<i>to wanna wish them harm.</i>

48:36.789 --> 48:38.582
<i>But he tells the grandson...</i>

48:38.666 --> 48:39.875
Get off her!

48:40.376 --> 48:42.461
...that hate only wears you down.

48:43.045 --> 48:45.339
It does not hurt your enemy.

48:47.133 --> 48:50.594
It's as if there are two wolves
living inside you.

48:50.678 --> 48:55.558
<i>One wolf is good.
He only fights when it is right to do so.</i>

48:55.641 --> 48:57.893
<i>That other wolf is hateful.</i>

48:57.977 --> 49:00.855
He fights no matter the reason.

49:00.938 --> 49:05.693
It's as if these two wolves are both
fighting to dominate your spirit.

49:05.776 --> 49:09.822
And the boy asks his grandfather,
"Which wolf is stronger?"

49:10.823 --> 49:15.870
And the grandfather looked into
his grandson's eyes, and he said,

49:16.954 --> 49:18.956
"It's the one you feed."

49:45.316 --> 49:46.358
Luke Cage.

49:49.653 --> 49:50.654
Where?

49:52.489 --> 49:53.490
Now?

50:18.641 --> 50:20.976
Bet you a man now, boy, huh?

50:23.604 --> 50:24.855
Want some of this?

50:27.858 --> 50:29.568
I want some.

50:30.305 --> 50:36.851
