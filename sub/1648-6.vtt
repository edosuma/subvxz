00:03.086 --> 00:06.203
-( people yelling)
- ( radio chatter)

00:06.381 --> 00:09.123
Hey hey.
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

00:10.427 --> 00:11.667
Ma'am. Ma'am, please.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.551
- Please, can you help me?
- No no no!

00:13.722 --> 00:15.258
- ( siren wailing)
- ( gunshots)

00:15.432 --> 00:18.094
Man:
Check them all. Check them all.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.850
( helicopter passing )

00:21.021 --> 00:22.181
( screams )

00:31.573 --> 00:34.280
- ( growling)
- ( man screaming )

00:37.954 --> 00:41.367
( gunshots)

00:41.541 --> 00:43.532
( panting )

00:46.713 --> 00:48.544
- Okay.
-( heart monitor beeping )

00:48.715 --> 00:50.626
I'm gonna get you
out of here, bud.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.586
- ( gunshots)
- ( grunts)

00:54.095 --> 00:56.677
-( helicopter passing )
- Okay. Okay.

01:05.815 --> 01:07.225
What do I do?

01:07.400 --> 01:09.015
( door opens)

01:11.946 --> 01:14.437
Man:
Come on, corporal. Move out!

01:15.784 --> 01:18.571
(gunfire)

01:18.745 --> 01:20.610
( pounds, grunts)

01:20.789 --> 01:23.326
( helicopter passes )

01:26.544 --> 01:29.877
Listen to me. If you're gonna wake up,
I need you to do it now.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.458
Okay? Now.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.840
Please, man,
you just show me a sign. Anything.

01:34.010 --> 01:37.002
- Please, Rick.
- ( explosion )

01:37.180 --> 01:39.045
( power whirring down )

01:39.224 --> 01:42.307
Man:
The place is coming down!

01:42.477 --> 01:44.809
Fall back!
All units fall back.

01:44.979 --> 01:46.810
(guns firing)

01:46.981 --> 01:48.892
(grunts)

01:59.119 --> 02:01.110
(crying ) l'm...

02:04.332 --> 02:05.993
I'm okay.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.709
(people yelling)

02:12.841 --> 02:14.877
- ( gunfire )
- ( woman screams )

02:15.051 --> 02:17.758
(growling)

02:48.877 --> 02:51.493
(theme music playing )

03:29.667 --> 03:31.749
Shane:
Daryl, you cover the back.

03:34.005 --> 03:36.917
Rick: Hello?

03:37.091 --> 03:39.423
- Hello?
- Shane: Close those doors.

03:39.594 --> 03:40.754
Watch for walkers.

03:47.977 --> 03:49.558
- Rick: Hello?
- ( gun cocks )

03:52.315 --> 03:54.055
Anybody infected?

03:54.234 --> 03:56.225
One of our group was.

03:57.278 --> 03:58.893
He didn't make it.

03:59.989 --> 04:02.571
Jenner: Why are you here?
What do you want?

04:02.742 --> 04:05.279
A chance.

04:05.453 --> 04:08.069
That's asking
an awful lot these days.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.452
I know.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.343
You all submit to a blood test.

04:24.514 --> 04:25.879
That's the price of admission.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.968
We can do that.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.513
You got stuff to bring in,
you do it now.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.804
Once this door closes,
it stays closed.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.822
- ( beeps )
- Vi, seal the main entrance.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.776
Kill the power up here.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.737
( rattles, clangs )

04:47.787 --> 04:48.947
( beeps )

04:49.122 --> 04:51.363
Rick Grimes.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.157
Dr. Edwin Jenner.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.042
(elevator humming)

04:57.213 --> 05:00.205
Doctors always go around
packing heat like that?

05:00.383 --> 05:03.671
There were plenty left lying around.
| familiarized myself.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.963
But you look harmless enough.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.381
Except you.

05:09.559 --> 05:12.141
I'll have to keep my eye on you.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.682
( chuckles )

05:20.028 --> 05:21.643
Carol:
Are we underground?

05:21.821 --> 05:23.357
Jennen
Are you claustrophobic?

05:23.531 --> 05:26.318
- A little.
- Try not to think about it.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.241
(humming, beeping)

05:40.548 --> 05:42.129
Welcome to zone 5.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.712
Where is everybody?

05:44.886 --> 05:46.877
The other doctors, the staff?

05:49.682 --> 05:51.547
I'm it.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.557
It's just me here.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.848
What about the person
you were speaking with?

05:57.023 --> 05:59.480
Vi?

05:59.650 --> 06:02.892
Jennen
Vi, say hello to our guests.

06:03.071 --> 06:06.279
Tell them... welcome.

06:06.449 --> 06:09.156
Computer:
Hello, guests. Welcome.

06:10.661 --> 06:12.276
I'm all that's left.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.573
I'm sorry.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.626
Andrea: What's the point?
If we were infected,

06:23.800 --> 06:25.415
we'd all be running a fever.

06:25.593 --> 06:28.710
I've already broken every rule
in the book letting you in here.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.220
Let me just at least be thorough.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.428
- ( syringe clicks)
- Jenner: All done.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.845
- Ooh.
- Jenner: Are you okay?

06:39.023 --> 06:41.139
-Mmm.
- She hasn't eaten in days.

06:41.317 --> 06:43.433
None of us have.

06:44.904 --> 06:48.442
- ( all laughing)
- Fine.

06:48.616 --> 06:49.947
You know, in Italy,

06:50.118 --> 06:53.610
children have a little bit
of wine with dinner.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.198
And in France.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.989
Well, when Carl is
in Italy or France,

06:58.167 --> 07:00.658
- he can have some then.
- What's it gonna hurt? Come on.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.498
- Come on.
-( Dale laughs)

07:02.672 --> 07:04.879
- What?
-( laughing )

07:07.552 --> 07:09.543
Dale:
There you are, young lad.

07:11.013 --> 07:13.049
( chuckles )

07:13.224 --> 07:15.681
- Eww.
- ( adults laughing)

07:15.852 --> 07:17.808
That's my boy. That's my boy.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.262
- Good boy.
- Yuck.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.477
- That tastes nasty.
-( laughing continues)

07:23.651 --> 07:25.937
Well, just stick
to soda pop there, bud.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.943
- Daryl: Not you, Glenn.
- What?

07:28.114 --> 07:30.821
Keep drinking, little man. I want
to see how red your face can get.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.779
(men laughing)

07:36.497 --> 07:38.874
(clinks glass)

07:39.041 --> 07:41.498
It seems to me we haven't
thanked our host properly.

07:41.669 --> 07:43.625
He is more than just our host.

07:43.796 --> 07:46.833
- Hear hear!
- Here's to you, doc. Booyah!

07:47.008 --> 07:48.498
- Men: Booyah!
- Thank you. Thank you, doctor.

07:48.676 --> 07:50.962
- T-Dog: Booyah!
- ( glasses clink)

07:51.137 --> 07:54.049
So when are you gonna tell us
what the hell happened here, doc?

07:55.683 --> 07:59.096
All the-- the other doctors

07:59.270 --> 08:02.137
that were supposed to be
figuring out what happened,

08:02.315 --> 08:04.772
- where are they?
- Rick: We're celebrating, Shane.

08:04.942 --> 08:07.319
Don't need to do this now.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.695
Whoa, wait a second.
This is why we're here, right?

08:11.824 --> 08:13.234
This was your move--

08:13.409 --> 08:15.195
supposed to find all the answers.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.075
Instead we--
( chuckles )

08:17.246 --> 08:19.453
we found him.

08:19.624 --> 08:22.457
Found one man. Why?

08:23.753 --> 08:25.618
Jennen
Well, when things got bad,

08:25.796 --> 08:28.173
a lot of people just left,

08:28.341 --> 08:31.629
went off to be
with their families.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.929
And when things got worse,

08:34.096 --> 08:36.712
when the military cordon
got overrun,

08:36.891 --> 08:38.472
the rest bolted.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.975
Every last one?

08:41.145 --> 08:45.263
No, many couldn't face
walking out the door.

08:47.193 --> 08:50.356
They... opted out.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.567
There was a rash of suicides.

08:55.952 --> 08:58.659
That was a bad time.

08:58.829 --> 09:00.160
You didn't leave.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.037
Why?

09:02.208 --> 09:04.039
ljust kept working,

09:04.210 --> 09:07.577
hoping to do some good.

09:11.467 --> 09:14.550
Dude, you are such a buzzkill, man.

09:17.765 --> 09:19.881
Most of the facility is powered down

09:20.059 --> 09:22.425
including housing,
so you'll have to make do here.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.514
The couches are comfortable,

09:24.689 --> 09:26.896
but there are cots
in storage if you like.

09:27.066 --> 09:31.184
There's a rec room down the hall
that you kids might enjoy.

09:31.362 --> 09:34.195
Just don't plug in
the video games, okay?

09:34.365 --> 09:37.072
Or anything that draws power.
The same applies--

09:37.243 --> 09:39.234
if you shower,
go easy on the hot water.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.617
Hot water?

09:43.791 --> 09:46.498
- That's what the man said.
- ( both laugh )

09:51.048 --> 09:52.709
( knob squeaks)

10:01.475 --> 10:03.466
(laughing)

10:04.979 --> 10:06.469
Ah!

10:43.351 --> 10:45.967
- Dale: Hey.
- ( Andrea vomiting )

10:50.316 --> 10:52.022
(sobs)

10:53.486 --> 10:55.522
(coughs)

10:56.572 --> 10:59.530
- Andrea?
- ( vomits )

10:59.700 --> 11:01.691
- Andrea.
- ( sobbing )

11:05.289 --> 11:06.745
That's it.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.373
That's it. Get it out.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.001
There you go.

11:14.632 --> 11:17.044
Oh... God.

11:17.218 --> 11:19.049
( flushes )

11:20.054 --> 11:22.045
(sobbing )

11:24.350 --> 11:26.215
Oh.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.098
Everything's gone.

11:30.272 --> 11:32.399
It's always better going down
than coming up, huh?

11:32.566 --> 11:34.648
I don't mean the wine, Dale.

11:34.819 --> 11:39.062
You know, it's over.
There's nothing left.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.606
Don't you see that?

11:41.784 --> 11:44.446
Oh, |-- | see a--

11:44.620 --> 11:47.453
a chance to make a new start.

11:47.623 --> 11:48.908
( laughs)

11:49.083 --> 11:50.948
Oh my God, Dale.

11:51.127 --> 11:54.494
Dale, didn't you see
the look on Jenner's face?

11:54.672 --> 11:57.755
Hear what I'm saying.

11:57.925 --> 12:00.667
There's nothing left.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.256
( knocks )

12:07.518 --> 12:09.429
How's the blood?

12:09.603 --> 12:11.764
No surprises.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.646
I came to thank you.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.941
You did.

12:28.372 --> 12:30.363
You all-- you all right?

12:30.541 --> 12:32.998
You don't know what it's like.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.784
( laughs)

12:34.962 --> 12:37.078
You don't know
what it's like out there.

12:37.256 --> 12:40.123
You may think you do,
but you don't.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.756
We'd have died out there.

12:46.807 --> 12:49.139
It was only a matter of time.

12:49.310 --> 12:51.266
There's too many of those things.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.393
My-- my boy...

12:58.486 --> 13:01.728
my-- my wife, I never--

13:04.200 --> 13:06.532
I never told 'em
what I really thought.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.781
I never even hinted, just--

13:17.254 --> 13:19.165
just kept it in.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.674
Kept it in and kept us
moving, you know.

13:23.844 --> 13:26.005
Just kept it in. Kept us--

13:26.180 --> 13:28.762
It'll all be okay.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.348
It'll be okay.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.062
(chuckling)

13:47.117 --> 13:49.108
- Any good books?
- Carol: Uh-huh.

13:49.286 --> 13:52.073
-( book closes )
- Enough to keep us busy for years.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.239
All right.
Come on, kids, it's bedtime.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.912
Baby, go say your prayers.
I'm gonna browse a bit.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.918
Carol:
Come on.

14:00.089 --> 14:02.831
This is the first night we might
actually get some real sleep.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.090
- Lori: Hmm.
- It's a miracle, isn't it?

14:24.321 --> 14:25.606
(slams door)

14:26.740 --> 14:28.731
(sighs)

14:28.909 --> 14:30.695
Jesus, you scared me.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.031
I'm gonna tell you a few things

14:33.205 --> 14:34.945
and you're gonna listen to me.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.534
Now is not the time.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.166
( chuckles )
Come on. When is it ever the time?

14:42.965 --> 14:45.206
How can you treat me like this?

14:45.384 --> 14:47.045
- You're kidding, right?
- No. Huh-uh.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.050
Because you told me
my husband was dead.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.303
Jesus, Lori. I didn't lie
to you, all right? I didn't.

14:51.473 --> 14:53.805
Do you know
what it was like there?

14:54.894 --> 14:57.977
Stop. Things were falling apart.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.263
They were slaughtering
people in the hallways.

15:00.441 --> 15:03.148
It was a massacre.
There were walkers everywhere.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.059
- So you left him?
- Everybody else ran.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.614
There were no doctors there.
It was just me.

15:07.781 --> 15:10.989
He was hooked up to machines
and I did not know what to do.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.617
I even took my ear
and I put it on his chest

15:13.787 --> 15:16.039
and I listened for a heartbeat
and I did not hear one.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.582
And |-|-|-|--
I don't know why.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.456
Maybe it was gunfire.
I don't know what it was,

15:19.627 --> 15:21.663
but there was no way
he could've survived that. No way.

15:21.837 --> 15:22.997
- He did.
-Yeah,

15:23.172 --> 15:25.663
but then I had y'all to think about,
didn't I? I had you and Carl,

15:25.841 --> 15:27.172
- and I needed to think about--
- Okay. No no.

15:27.343 --> 15:28.708
I had to get you guys
safe to Atlanta.

15:28.886 --> 15:30.251
That's what I had to do. Just stop.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.839
If you thought for one second

15:32.014 --> 15:34.380
that he was still alive,
would you have come?

15:34.558 --> 15:36.344
So I saved your life--

15:36.518 --> 15:38.895
you and your little boy's.
That's what I did.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.678
Right?

15:41.774 --> 15:43.139
Okay.

15:43.317 --> 15:46.559
And if I could've traded places
with him, I would have.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.987
I would trade places
with him right now because--

15:50.157 --> 15:52.489
- No no no. No.
- No no no, you--

15:52.660 --> 15:53.775
- I love you. Shh shh.
- No. No, you're drunk.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.489
- I love you.
- No, you're drunk.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.654
And I know there were some things
that say that you love me too,

15:57.831 --> 16:00.038
because there's no way that you could've
been with me the way that you were.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.165
- Shane. Shane. Shane!
- Just-- okay, stop.

16:02.336 --> 16:05.203
- Listen. You love me.
- Get your hands off me.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.212
- I love you. There's nobody here.
- Please! Ah!

16:07.383 --> 16:09.590
Stop, Lori.
It's all right. Just--

16:09.760 --> 16:11.921
( groans )

16:24.358 --> 16:26.064
(pounds wall)

16:26.235 --> 16:28.521
(sobbing )

16:46.714 --> 16:50.673
- ( belt buckle rattles )
- ( shoes clatter)

16:58.684 --> 17:00.265
( switch clicks )

17:12.489 --> 17:14.480
(crying)

17:18.954 --> 17:21.696
(whispering )
We don't have to be afraid anymore.

17:24.501 --> 17:26.787
We're safe here.

17:26.962 --> 17:28.623
All right?

17:33.260 --> 17:35.251
(sniffling)

17:40.684 --> 17:42.299
Glenn: Hello.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.762
- Rick: Morning.
- Are you hungover?

17:47.066 --> 17:50.650
- Mom said you'd be.
- Mom is right.

17:50.819 --> 17:53.356
Mom has that annoying habit.

17:53.530 --> 17:57.944
Eggs. Powdered, but--
but I do 'em good.

17:58.118 --> 18:00.450
- ( Glenn moans)
- T-Dog: I bet you can't tell.

18:00.621 --> 18:04.614
- Protein helps the hangover.
- ( moaning )

18:04.792 --> 18:06.328
Where'd all this come from?

18:06.502 --> 18:08.163
-Jennen
- Rick: Could you help me, please?

18:08.337 --> 18:09.998
He thought we could use it.

18:10.172 --> 18:11.833
- Rick: Thank you.
- Some of us, at least.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.749
Don't ever ever ever
let me drink again.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.009
- Shane: Hey.
- Hey.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.922
Rick:
Feel as bad as I do?

18:21.100 --> 18:22.840
Worse.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.345
The hell happened to you?

18:27.523 --> 18:29.309
Your neck?

18:29.483 --> 18:31.064
I must have done it in my sleep.

18:31.235 --> 18:32.725
Never seen you do that before.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.689
Me neither.

18:34.863 --> 18:37.195
Not like me at all.

18:41.745 --> 18:44.532
- Jenner: Morning.
- Shane: Hey, doc.

18:44.706 --> 18:48.369
Doctor, I don't mean to slam you
with questions first thing--

18:48.544 --> 18:50.284
But you will anyway.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.544
We didn't come here
for the eggs.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.423
- ( clicks, beeps )
- Give me playback of TS-19.

19:04.601 --> 19:06.512
Vi:
Playback of TS-19.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.848
( beeping )

19:09.022 --> 19:11.729
Jenner: Few people
ever got a chance to see this.

19:11.900 --> 19:13.856
Very few.

19:19.992 --> 19:23.359
- Is that a brain?
- An extraordinary one.

19:25.080 --> 19:27.366
Not that it matters in the end.

19:27.541 --> 19:28.872
Take us in for EIV.

19:29.042 --> 19:31.533
Vi:
Enhanced internal view.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.555
What are those lights?

19:51.315 --> 19:53.351
Jennen
It's a person's life--

19:53.525 --> 19:55.106
experiences, memories.

19:57.404 --> 19:59.895
Somewhere in
all that organic wiring,

20:00.073 --> 20:02.359
all those ripples of light,

20:02.534 --> 20:04.399
is you--

20:04.578 --> 20:07.035
the thing that makes you unique.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.572
And human.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.957
You don't make sense ever?

20:12.127 --> 20:13.492
Those are synapses,

20:13.670 --> 20:15.285
electric impulses in the brain

20:15.464 --> 20:17.295
that carry all the messages.

20:17.466 --> 20:20.082
They determine
everything a person says

20:20.260 --> 20:23.127
does or thinks
from the moment of birth

20:23.305 --> 20:25.091
to the moment of death.

20:25.265 --> 20:28.382
Death? That's what
this is, a vigil?

20:28.560 --> 20:30.221
Yes.

20:31.355 --> 20:35.314
Or rather
the playback of the vigil.

20:36.443 --> 20:38.399
This person died?

20:39.613 --> 20:41.103
Who?

20:41.281 --> 20:43.818
Jennen
Test Subject 19.

20:44.952 --> 20:47.364
Someone who was bitten

20:47.537 --> 20:49.664
and infected...

20:50.707 --> 20:52.959
and volunteered to have us

20:53.126 --> 20:55.208
record the process.

20:58.006 --> 21:00.383
Vi, scan forward
to the first event.

21:00.550 --> 21:03.917
- Vi: Scanning to first event.
- ( beeping )

21:09.768 --> 21:11.759
What is that?

21:13.480 --> 21:16.142
It invades the brain
like meningitis.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.976
The adrenal glands hemorrhage,

21:20.153 --> 21:21.859
the brain goes into shutdown,

21:22.030 --> 21:23.986
then the major organs.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.656
Then death.

21:31.039 --> 21:33.746
Everything you ever were
or ever will be...

21:35.919 --> 21:38.205
gone.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.496
Is that what happened to Jim?

21:40.674 --> 21:42.539
Yes.

21:51.226 --> 21:53.387
Lori:
She lost somebody two days ago.

21:53.562 --> 21:55.143
Her sister.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.979
I lost somebody too.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.687
I know how devastating it is.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.694
Scan to
the second event.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.984
Vi:
Scanning to second event.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.912
Jennen
The resurrection times vary wildly.

22:14.082 --> 22:15.697
We had reports of it happening

22:15.876 --> 22:17.958
in as little as three minutes.

22:18.128 --> 22:20.244
The longest we heard of
was eight hours.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.879
In the case of this patient,

22:23.050 --> 22:25.712
it was two hours, one minute...

22:26.762 --> 22:29.128
seven seconds.

22:39.358 --> 22:42.896
- It restarts the brain?
- No, just the brain stem.

22:43.070 --> 22:46.107
Basically,
it gets them up and moving.

22:46.281 --> 22:48.146
But they're not alive?

22:49.826 --> 22:51.612
You tell me.

22:52.662 --> 22:54.869
It's nothing like before.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.201
Most of that brain is dark.

22:57.376 --> 23:00.038
Jennen
Dark, lifeless, dead.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.668
The frontal lobe, the neocortex,

23:01.838 --> 23:03.044
the human part--
that doesn't come back.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.046
The you part.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.916
Just a shell

23:08.095 --> 23:10.507
driven by mindless instinct.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.682
God. What was that?

23:16.770 --> 23:19.102
He shot his patient in the head.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.227
Didn't you?

23:23.402 --> 23:25.267
Jennen
Vi, power down the main screen

23:25.445 --> 23:26.776
and the workstations.

23:26.947 --> 23:30.110
Vi: Powering down
main screen and workstations.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.948
You have no idea
what it is, do you?

23:37.749 --> 23:39.250
It could be microbial,

23:39.418 --> 23:41.249
viral, parasitic,

23:41.420 --> 23:44.378
-fungaL
- Or the wrath of God?

23:44.548 --> 23:47.836
There is that.

23:48.009 --> 23:49.840
Andrea:
Somebody must know something.

23:50.011 --> 23:51.592
Somebody somewhere.

23:51.763 --> 23:54.971
Carol: There are others, right?
Other facilities?

23:56.852 --> 23:58.388
There may be some.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.678
People like me.

24:00.856 --> 24:02.721
But you don't know?
How can you not know?

24:02.899 --> 24:04.275
Jennen
Everything went down.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.308
Communications,
directives-- all of it.

24:06.486 --> 24:09.353
I've been in the dark
for almost a month.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.487
So it's notjust here.

24:11.658 --> 24:15.276
There's nothing left
anywhere? Nothing?

24:15.454 --> 24:17.991
That's what
you're really saying, right?

24:27.757 --> 24:29.668
Jesus.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.879
Man, I'm gonna get
shit-faced drunk again.

24:32.053 --> 24:34.715
Dr. Jenner, I know this
has been taxing for you

24:34.890 --> 24:38.053
and I hate to ask
one more question, but...

24:39.269 --> 24:40.884
that clock--

24:41.062 --> 24:43.053
it's counting down.

24:45.108 --> 24:47.099
What happens at zero?

24:49.613 --> 24:54.027
The basement generators--
they run out of fuel.

25:00.874 --> 25:03.331
Vi, what happens
when the power runs out?

25:03.502 --> 25:05.584
Vi:
When the power runs out,

25:05.754 --> 25:09.542
facility-wide
decontamination will occur.

25:11.843 --> 25:13.504
( beeps )

25:13.678 --> 25:15.930
Glenn: Decontamination--
what does that mean?

25:16.097 --> 25:18.053
Shane: I don't like
the way Jenner clammed up.

25:18.225 --> 25:20.386
The way he just
wandered off like that.

25:20.560 --> 25:23.097
What's wrong with him?
Seriously, man,

25:23.271 --> 25:24.886
is he nuts, medicated or what?

25:26.233 --> 25:28.394
In there.

25:32.739 --> 25:36.072
- ( beeps)
-( lights humming)

25:37.536 --> 25:39.151
Check that way.

25:39.329 --> 25:40.865
Shane.

25:56.471 --> 25:59.087
(chugging)

26:06.356 --> 26:07.846
It's empty.

26:08.024 --> 26:10.515
- ( sighs )
_ ( generator clacks )

26:10.694 --> 26:13.686
- Vi: Emergency lighting on.
- What the hell is this?

26:17.033 --> 26:18.944
Hey, you guys kill the lights?

26:19.119 --> 26:21.110
- Nah, it just went out.
- Rick: Anything?

26:21.288 --> 26:24.746
T-Dog:
Yeah, a lot of dead generators

26:24.916 --> 26:27.328
and more empty fuel drums
than I can count.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.670
It can't be down to just that one.

26:39.806 --> 26:43.469
Mom? Something wrong?

26:44.978 --> 26:46.684
Nothing. It'sjust...

26:46.855 --> 26:49.972
the air conditioning stopped.

27:04.998 --> 27:07.614
( sighs, sniffles )

27:07.792 --> 27:10.408
I did the best I could
in the time that I had.

27:13.006 --> 27:14.997
I hope you'd be proud of that.

27:35.528 --> 27:37.985
We always think
there's gonna be more time...

27:38.156 --> 27:41.364
( power whirs down )

27:43.953 --> 27:45.739
...then it runs out.

27:47.165 --> 27:48.951
Carol:
Why is the air off?

27:49.125 --> 27:51.502
- And the lights in our room?
- Daryl: What's going on?

27:51.670 --> 27:53.080
Why is everything turned off?

27:53.254 --> 27:54.869
Energy use is being prioritized.

27:55.048 --> 27:57.334
Dale:
Air isn't a priority? And lights?

27:57.509 --> 28:00.546
It's not up to me.
Zone 5 is shutting itself down.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.756
Daryl: Hey! Hey, what the hell
does that mean?

28:02.931 --> 28:05.263
- ( power whirs down )
- Hey, man, I'm talking to you.

28:05.433 --> 28:07.924
What do you mean
it's shutting itself down?

28:08.103 --> 28:09.718
How can a building do anything?

28:09.896 --> 28:11.397
- Jenner: You'd be surprised.
- Rick?

28:16.361 --> 28:18.067
Jenner, what's happening?

28:18.238 --> 28:21.401
The system is dropping all
the nonessential uses of power.

28:21.574 --> 28:24.907
It's designed to keep the computers
running to the last possible second.

28:25.078 --> 28:27.194
That started as we approached
the half-hour mark.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.203
Right on schedule.

28:40.427 --> 28:43.260
- It was the French.
- What?

28:43.430 --> 28:45.216
They were the last ones
to hold out as far as I know.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.255
While our people were
bolting out the doors

28:47.434 --> 28:48.924
and committing suicide
in the hallways,

28:49.102 --> 28:50.467
they stayed in the labs till the end.

28:50.645 --> 28:53.887
Theythought
they were close to a solution.

28:54.065 --> 28:55.771
What happened?

28:55.942 --> 28:58.058
Jenner: The same thing
that's happening here.

28:59.112 --> 29:00.443
No power grid.

29:00.613 --> 29:02.899
Ran out ofjuice.

29:04.325 --> 29:07.112
The world runs on fossil fuel.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.152
I mean,
how stupid is that?

29:09.330 --> 29:12.117
- Shane: Let me tell you--
- Rick: To hell with it. I don't care.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.624
Lori, grab our things.
Everybody, get your stuff.

29:14.794 --> 29:16.750
We're getting out of here now!

29:16.921 --> 29:18.502
Oh, okay.

29:18.673 --> 29:20.459
- ( alarm blaring )
- What's that?

29:22.802 --> 29:24.463
What's that?

29:24.637 --> 29:27.549
Vi:
30 minutes to decontamination.

29:30.810 --> 29:32.892
Daryl:
Doc, what's going on here, damn it?

29:33.062 --> 29:34.643
Shane:
Everybody, y'all heard Rick.

29:34.814 --> 29:36.350
Get your stuff and let's go!
Go now! Go!

29:36.524 --> 29:37.809
- Let's go.
- Glenn: Come on!

29:37.984 --> 29:40.691
(whirs, clangs)

29:40.862 --> 29:42.022
No.

29:43.490 --> 29:45.321
Did you just lock us in?

29:45.492 --> 29:47.357
He just locked us in!

29:47.535 --> 29:50.242
We've hit the 30-minute window.
I am recording.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.822
- Carl.
- Carl: Mom!

29:54.000 --> 29:55.581
- You son of a bitch.
- Shane!

29:55.752 --> 29:57.583
- You locked us in here!
- No, stop. Don't!

29:57.754 --> 30:00.416
- You locked us in here!
- Shane: No no no no! Don't!

30:00.590 --> 30:02.376
Wait, no!
No, don't do it.

30:05.053 --> 30:07.339
Hey, Jenner,
open that door now.

30:07.514 --> 30:09.755
There's no point.
Everything topside is locked down.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.264
The emergency exits are sealed.

30:11.434 --> 30:12.765
Dale:
Well, open the damn things.

30:12.936 --> 30:15.018
That's not something I control.
The computers do.

30:15.188 --> 30:18.021
I told you once
that front door closed,

30:18.191 --> 30:20.352
it wouldn't open again.
You heard me say that.

30:23.112 --> 30:25.148
- It's better this way.
- What is?

30:25.323 --> 30:27.530
What happens in 28 minutes?

30:27.700 --> 30:29.201
( keyboard clacks )

30:30.870 --> 30:32.701
- What happens in 28 minutes?!
- Daryl: Come on!

30:32.872 --> 30:35.204
Do you know what this place is?!

30:35.375 --> 30:37.707
We protected the public

30:37.877 --> 30:40.664
from very nasty stuff!

30:42.465 --> 30:44.706
Weaponized smallpox!

30:44.884 --> 30:47.967
Ebola strains that could
wipe out half the country!

30:48.137 --> 30:51.300
Stuff you don't want
getting out! Ever!

31:04.153 --> 31:06.735
In the event
of a catastrophic power failure--

31:06.906 --> 31:09.397
in a terrorist attack,
for example--

31:09.576 --> 31:12.818
HITs are deployed to prevent
any organisms from getting out.

31:12.996 --> 31:15.112
HlTs?

31:16.791 --> 31:18.782
- Vi, define.
- Vi: HlTs--

31:18.960 --> 31:21.576
high-impulse thermobaric
fuel-air explosives

31:21.754 --> 31:24.496
consist of a two-stage
aerosol ignition

31:24.674 --> 31:27.791
that produces a blast wave
of significantly greater power

31:27.969 --> 31:29.834
and duration than
any other known explosive

31:30.013 --> 31:31.469
except nuclear.

31:31.639 --> 31:34.426
The vacuum-pressure effect
ignites the oxygen

31:34.601 --> 31:36.887
at between 5,000° and 6,000°

31:37.061 --> 31:39.393
and is useful when
the greatest loss of life

31:39.564 --> 31:41.930
and damage
to structures is desired.

31:42.108 --> 31:44.269
It sets the air on fire.

31:47.780 --> 31:49.645
No pain.

31:49.824 --> 31:51.155
( both crying )

31:51.326 --> 31:53.942
Jennen
An end to sorrow, grief...

31:55.955 --> 31:57.491
reg ret.

32:05.798 --> 32:07.709
Everything.

32:14.599 --> 32:17.181
Open the damn door!

32:18.770 --> 32:20.601
Out of my way!

32:20.772 --> 32:22.228
- ( grunts)
- T-Dog: Daryl!

32:23.733 --> 32:25.724
(both pounding, grunting)

32:26.778 --> 32:28.894
(crying)

32:30.698 --> 32:32.359
You should've
left well enough alone.

32:32.533 --> 32:35.366
- It would've been so much easier.
- Lori: Easier for who?

32:35.536 --> 32:37.367
All of you.
You know what's out there--

32:37.538 --> 32:41.372
a short, brutal life
and an agonizing death.

32:41.542 --> 32:45.660
Your-- your sister--
what was her name?

32:45.838 --> 32:47.374
-Amv
- Jenner: Amy.

32:47.548 --> 32:49.584
You know what this does.

32:49.759 --> 32:50.874
You've seen it.

32:51.052 --> 32:53.293
Is that really what you want
for your wife and son?

32:53.471 --> 32:55.507
( emphatically )
I don't want this.

32:55.682 --> 32:57.843
- ( axe bangs )
- Can't make a dent.

32:58.017 --> 33:00.508
Those doors are designed
to withstand a rocket launcher.

33:00.687 --> 33:02.552
- Well, your head ain't!
- Rick: Whoa! Whoa!

33:02.730 --> 33:04.516
Daryl! Daryl!

33:04.691 --> 33:08.309
Just back up! Back up!

33:08.486 --> 33:10.772
Jennen
You do want this.

33:10.947 --> 33:12.187
Last night you said

33:12.365 --> 33:13.855
you knew it was just
a matter of time

33:14.033 --> 33:15.694
before everybody
you loved was dead.

33:15.868 --> 33:18.029
What?

33:20.039 --> 33:21.870
What?
You really said that?

33:22.041 --> 33:23.542
After all your big talk?

33:23.710 --> 33:25.246
I had to keep
hope alive, didn't I?

33:25.420 --> 33:27.035
Jennen
There is no hope.

33:27.213 --> 33:29.204
- There never was.
- There's always hope.

33:29.382 --> 33:31.088
Maybe it won't be you,
maybe not here,

33:31.259 --> 33:32.715
but somebody somewhere--

33:32.885 --> 33:35.376
What part of "everything is gone"
do you not understand?

33:35.555 --> 33:37.796
Jennen
Listen to your friend. She gets it.

33:37.974 --> 33:40.590
This is what takes us down.

33:41.644 --> 33:44.761
This is
our extinction event.

33:44.939 --> 33:48.477
(crying continues)

33:48.651 --> 33:50.937
Carol:
This isn't right.

33:51.112 --> 33:53.444
You can'tjust keep us here.

33:53.614 --> 33:56.230
One tiny moment--

33:56.409 --> 33:58.240
a millisecond. No pain.

33:58.411 --> 34:01.949
My daughter doesn't deserve
to die like this.

34:05.001 --> 34:07.413
Wouldn't it be kinder,

34:07.587 --> 34:10.920
more compassionate
to just hold your loved ones

34:11.090 --> 34:14.253
- and wait for the clock to run down?
- ( gun cocks)

34:14.427 --> 34:15.917
- Shane, no!
- Out of the way, Rick!

34:18.598 --> 34:20.259
or I'm gonna blow your head off.
Do you hear me?!

34:20.433 --> 34:23.345
Brother, brother,
this is not the way you do this.

34:23.519 --> 34:25.851
- We will never get out of here.
- Shane, you listen to him.

34:26.022 --> 34:29.185
- Shane: It's too late.
- He dies, we all--

34:29.358 --> 34:31.440
- ( yelling )
- --we all die! Shane!

34:37.200 --> 34:38.781
Shane!

34:38.951 --> 34:40.816
(grunts)

34:41.829 --> 34:44.741
( panting )

34:47.835 --> 34:50.668
Are you done now?
Are you done?

34:50.838 --> 34:52.829
Yeah, I guess we all are.

35:14.987 --> 35:16.978
Ithink you're lying.

35:19.325 --> 35:21.532
- What?
- Rick: You're lying

35:21.702 --> 35:24.239
about no hope.

35:24.413 --> 35:26.790
If that were true,
you'd have bolted with the rest

35:26.958 --> 35:29.825
or taken the easy way out.
You didn't.

35:31.754 --> 35:33.460
You chose the hard path.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.337
- Why?
- It doesn't matter.

35:35.508 --> 35:38.090
It does matter.
It always matters.

35:38.261 --> 35:41.094
You stayed when others ran.

35:41.264 --> 35:44.347
- Why?
- Not because I wanted to.

35:44.517 --> 35:46.678
I made a promise...

35:48.354 --> 35:49.890
to her.

35:50.064 --> 35:52.271
My wife.

35:54.485 --> 35:57.898
Test subject 19
was your wife?

35:58.072 --> 36:01.280
Jenner: She begged me
to keep going as long as I could.

36:02.743 --> 36:04.574
- How could I say no?
- ( pounding )

36:04.745 --> 36:07.282
She was dying.

36:07.456 --> 36:09.708
It should've been me
on that table.

36:09.876 --> 36:11.161
I wouldn't have
mattered to anybody.

36:11.335 --> 36:14.498
She was a loss to the world.

36:14.672 --> 36:17.379
Hell, she ran this place.
ljust worked here.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.962
In our field, she was an Einstein.

36:21.262 --> 36:24.504
Me? I'm just... Edwin Jenner.

36:24.682 --> 36:27.549
She could've done
something about this.

36:27.727 --> 36:29.843
Not me.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.603
Your wife didn't have a choice.

36:32.773 --> 36:37.016
You do.
That's-- that's all we want--

36:38.070 --> 36:40.857
a choice, a chance.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.488
(Daryl grunting)

36:42.658 --> 36:45.525
Let us keep trying
as long as we can.

36:51.959 --> 36:55.872
I told you topside's locked down.
I can't open those.

37:03.512 --> 37:05.503
( beeping )

37:07.892 --> 37:09.723
Come on!

37:11.729 --> 37:13.560
- Let's go!
- Come on, let's go!

37:13.731 --> 37:16.689
- Daryl: Come on!
- T-Dog: Move it! Move it!

37:16.859 --> 37:19.316
- Daryl: Come on, let's go!
- Carol: We're gonna get out of here.

37:19.487 --> 37:21.068
There's your chance. Take it.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.446
I'm grateful.

37:23.616 --> 37:25.902
- The day will come when you won't be.
- Glenn: Let's go!

37:30.414 --> 37:32.405
(whispering )

37:39.257 --> 37:42.841
Hey, we've got four minutes left!
Come on!

37:43.010 --> 37:45.592
- Let's go. Let's go, Jacqui.
- No no, I'm staying.

37:45.763 --> 37:47.549
I'm staying, sweetie.

37:47.723 --> 37:50.135
- But that's insane!
- No, it's completely sane.

37:50.309 --> 37:52.425
For the first time
in a long time.

37:52.603 --> 37:55.060
I'm not ending up
like Jim and Amy.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.391
There's no time to argue

37:59.568 --> 38:02.230
and no point,
not if you want to get out.

38:02.405 --> 38:04.441
Just get out. Get out.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.826
T-Dog. Come on, man.

38:07.994 --> 38:09.655
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

38:17.336 --> 38:19.292
I'm staying too.

38:20.339 --> 38:22.170
Andrea, no.

38:24.885 --> 38:27.262
- Just go! Go!
- Shane: Come on.

38:36.230 --> 38:37.845
Andrea,

38:38.024 --> 38:40.982
this isn't what
Amy would want for you.

38:41.152 --> 38:44.269
She's dead,
and you need to leave.

38:53.414 --> 38:56.577
- Glenn: It doesn't work!
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

38:56.751 --> 38:59.493
- Try it! Try it! Try it now!
- Shane: Daryl!

39:02.006 --> 39:04.588
- Daryl: Come on! Come on!
- Stay close, sweetheart.

39:04.759 --> 39:06.841
(grunting)

39:09.096 --> 39:10.552
Time's almost up.

39:12.391 --> 39:14.882
Daryl, look out!
(yelling )

39:22.109 --> 39:24.521
Dog, get down! Get down!

39:27.740 --> 39:29.571
-Jesus.
- Sophia: The glass won't break?

39:30.618 --> 39:33.075
Rick, I have something
that might help.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.070
Carol, I don't think
a nail file's gonna do it.

39:36.248 --> 39:38.079
Your first morning at camp,

39:38.250 --> 39:41.708
when I washed your uniform
I found this in your pocket.

39:44.465 --> 39:46.001
Come on.

39:46.175 --> 39:48.712
Glenn:
Look out!

39:55.768 --> 39:57.804
Oh, sh--

39:57.978 --> 39:59.434
- Get down! Get down!
- Shit!

39:59.605 --> 40:01.937
( glass shatters )

40:08.239 --> 40:09.945
Okay.

40:10.991 --> 40:12.777
You win.

40:20.835 --> 40:23.952
- What are you doing?
- I said okay.

40:26.382 --> 40:29.215
- Don't pull this, Dale.
- I'm not pulling anything.

40:29.385 --> 40:31.797
If you're staying, I stay too.

40:31.971 --> 40:34.963
He's right. We know
what's waiting for us out there.

40:35.141 --> 40:37.097
I don't want to face it alone.

40:37.268 --> 40:40.055
Dale, get the hell out.

40:40.229 --> 40:42.470
I don't want you here.

40:42.648 --> 40:45.481
Too bad.
See, you don't get to do that,

40:45.651 --> 40:47.642
to-- to come into somebody's life,

40:47.820 --> 40:50.436
make them care
and then just check out.

40:56.203 --> 40:57.989
I'm staying.

41:00.207 --> 41:01.947
The matter is settled.

41:04.545 --> 41:07.161
(zombies growling )

41:19.560 --> 41:21.972
(grunts)

41:22.146 --> 41:24.057
( panting )

41:32.740 --> 41:34.230
Wait wait wait. Wait wait.

41:34.408 --> 41:35.909
They're coming.

41:44.376 --> 41:46.367
( computer beeping )

41:47.713 --> 41:49.499
They got out.

42:07.066 --> 42:09.182
Lori:
Come on.

42:09.360 --> 42:12.147
- ( horn honks)
- Dale, get down! Down!

42:12.321 --> 42:16.030
Get back!
Everybody down! Down!

42:18.536 --> 42:19.821
Get down!

43:07.459 --> 43:09.324
( exhales )

43:14.842 --> 43:17.800
Come on. Come on.

43:17.970 --> 43:19.926
(folk music playing )

43:20.931 --> 43:22.592
Come on. Come on.
Get in, get in, get in.

43:22.766 --> 43:24.472
Get in!

43:27.313 --> 43:31.397
J‘ If today was not
a crooked highway J‘

43:33.777 --> 43:38.567
J‘ If tonight was not
a crooked trail J‘

43:38.741 --> 43:44.156
J‘ If tomorrow wasn't
such a long time J‘

43:44.330 --> 43:48.198
J‘ Then lonesome would mean
nothing to you at all... J‘

43:48.375 --> 43:49.990
(engine starts)

43:50.169 --> 43:54.788
J‘ Yes and only if my own
true love was waiting J‘

43:56.008 --> 44:00.342
J‘ If I could hear
her heart softly pounding J‘

44:00.512 --> 44:04.471
J‘ Yes and only
if she was lying by me J‘

44:06.810 --> 44:08.926
J‘ I'd lie J‘

44:09.104 --> 44:13.017
J‘ In my bed once again J‘

44:16.362 --> 44:20.526
J‘ I can't see
my reflection in the water J‘

44:22.701 --> 44:27.035
J‘ I can't speak
the sounds to show no pain J‘

44:27.206 --> 44:32.417
J‘ I can't hear the echo
of my footsteps J‘

44:32.586 --> 44:36.875
J‘ Or remember the sounds
of my own name J‘

44:39.051 --> 44:42.919
J‘ Yes and only
if my own true love was waiting J‘

44:45.474 --> 44:49.012
J‘ And if I could hear
her heart softly pounding J‘

44:49.186 --> 44:54.021
J‘ Yes, and only
if she was lying by me J‘

44:54.191 --> 45:01.688
J‘ I'd lie in my bed once again. J‘

45:09.998 --> 45:12.410
Mmm.
