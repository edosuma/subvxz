WEBVTT

00:03.424 --> 00:05.790
It's poison to vampires.

00:07.495 --> 00:09.827
And most of the vampires lore
is crap.

00:10.030 --> 00:12.828
The only way to kill them
is by beheading.

00:13.033 --> 00:14.193
Hey, Dean. Jody Mills.

00:14.401 --> 00:16.961
Jody, are you sure you're
ready to jump back in the fray?

00:20.074 --> 00:21.405
This wackadoo stuff keeps coming.

00:22.977 --> 00:24.535
More I know, better armed I'll be.

00:24.745 --> 00:26.406
- Did you get...
- Born again?

00:26.614 --> 00:28.946
- Yeah.
- I don't make promises I can't keep.

00:29.149 --> 00:30.616
I enjoy church.

00:30.818 --> 00:34.584
I mean, after my son
and my husband...

00:37.658 --> 00:39.853
...I needed something
that made sense to me.

00:52.006 --> 00:53.473
All right, Missy, calm down!

00:53.674 --> 00:57.508
- Let me go!
- Calm down!

00:58.212 --> 00:59.907
Let me out!

01:05.920 --> 01:07.888
Hey, Frank, someone
smashed the front window

01:08.088 --> 01:10.955
over at Dawson's Hardware, possible
B&E. Need you to check it out.

01:11.158 --> 01:13.956
Yeah, copy that,
but the bullpen's empty,

01:14.161 --> 01:15.321
and I got someone in holding.

01:15.496 --> 01:18.556
Sheriff's headed to the station now.
They won't be alone long.

01:18.766 --> 01:20.961
Roger that.
I'm heading out.

01:21.168 --> 01:23.329
Hey, don't leave me.

01:25.306 --> 01:26.933
Please.

01:58.939 --> 02:02.033
- Cody.
- There you are, girl.

02:02.242 --> 02:04.005
- How did you find me?
- Come on.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.974
You don't really need
to ask that, do you?

02:07.781 --> 02:09.145
Are the others with you?

02:09.350 --> 02:12.080
Everyone was off on a hunt
when I'd realized you'd run away.

02:12.286 --> 02:14.083
Figured I'd do you and them a favor
and come take care of this

02:14.288 --> 02:17.815
- before they even know we're gone.
- You can't get me in here.

02:26.300 --> 02:29.167
Cop sure was in a hurry
to check out that B&E I faked.

02:31.772 --> 02:33.637
Barely even saw me coming.

02:35.542 --> 02:37.169
I keep telling you,

02:37.378 --> 02:42.042
you can run and you can hide,
but... we will always find you.

03:13.647 --> 03:17.174
- You boys are a sight.
- Jody.

03:17.384 --> 03:21.115
- How's the shoulder?
- Eh. Only aches when it rains.

03:21.321 --> 03:22.321
How you boys been?

03:22.489 --> 03:25.185
- Peachy.
- Touch and go.

03:25.392 --> 03:28.884
- I know the feeling.
- So, what you got for us?

03:41.408 --> 03:42.932
Yeah, that's a vamp, all right.

03:44.478 --> 03:47.777
I don't know, Sammy. Looks like Jody
might not need our help anymore.

03:47.981 --> 03:49.461
- They grow up too fast.
- Don't they?

03:49.650 --> 03:53.518
Yeah, joke all you want.
There's more where this came from.

03:53.721 --> 03:55.086
More?

03:55.289 --> 03:56.813
My men brought in a runaway
last night.

03:57.024 --> 03:58.864
There's no ID on her,
nothing on her, actually,

03:58.992 --> 04:00.789
except for a bus ticket
out of Nebraska.

04:00.994 --> 04:02.928
Total Jane Doe.
She won't even give me her name.

04:03.130 --> 04:05.758
Girl's basically feral.
She's got zero manners,

04:05.966 --> 04:08.127
didn't even thank me for saving her.

04:08.335 --> 04:11.793
Anyhow, this thing went to
plenty of trouble to get at her.

04:12.005 --> 04:13.404
And to hear him tell it,

04:13.607 --> 04:16.576
the others will want her
at least as bad as he did.

04:16.777 --> 04:18.301
- Sounds like a nest.
- Yeah.

04:18.512 --> 04:23.142
Nest? I'm guessing that's not
half as cute and cozy as it sounds.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.910
Oh, I'm afraid not.

04:33.527 --> 04:35.256
Wilson and Fisher?

04:35.462 --> 04:37.692
You two are FBI,
then I'm Taylor Swift.

04:37.898 --> 04:39.866
That wasn't a dental ID.

04:40.067 --> 04:42.865
It was a fang check.
You're hunters.

04:46.673 --> 04:50.769
And you're alive because
hunters trained the sheriff.

04:50.978 --> 04:54.436
I think the first words out of your
mouth should be a "thank you."

04:58.185 --> 05:02.053
So, who were you
to this vamp, anyway, hmm?

05:02.256 --> 05:04.417
What's so special about you?

05:05.726 --> 05:07.023
Is there a nest?

05:12.599 --> 05:16.194
Sorry to interrupt.
We got a match on her DNA.

05:23.844 --> 05:28.042
Annie Jones. Reported abducted
outside of Kenosha in '06.

05:28.248 --> 05:31.843
Raised by an elderly grandparent.
No living kin.

05:34.988 --> 05:37.183
You think the vamps
are the ones that took her?

05:37.391 --> 05:39.018
Eight years is a long time
for a human to live with vampires

05:39.226 --> 05:40.215
without getting killed or turned.

05:40.427 --> 05:43.055
You're the experts,
but there was something

05:43.263 --> 05:45.424
familiar about the way
this vamp talked to her.

05:45.632 --> 05:48.965
Jody's right. And she had scars
on her neck, feeding scars.

05:52.039 --> 05:54.769
They're layered,
as if they'd been built on for years.

05:54.975 --> 05:57.000
So she's a blood slave.

05:57.211 --> 06:00.112
We've seen it before,
vampires keeping people as pets,

06:00.314 --> 06:03.442
human feedbags.
Sometimes, these slaves...

06:03.650 --> 06:05.242
- Stay loyal to their captors.
- Yeah.

06:05.452 --> 06:08.114
- Right.
- So, this girl's not talking

06:08.322 --> 06:11.382
'cause she's got a case of what?
Vampiric Stockholm syndrome?

06:11.592 --> 06:13.150
She's protecting the nest.

06:13.894 --> 06:17.125
So you feel a debt.
They gave you a home, raised you.

06:17.331 --> 06:19.799
Annie, we get it.
Loyalty is a very powerful thing.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.968
- My name is Alex.
- No, it's not.

06:22.169 --> 06:24.603
Your name is Annie Jones.

06:24.805 --> 06:26.773
Those vampires stole you.

06:26.974 --> 06:28.305
They're monsters, Annie.

06:28.508 --> 06:30.305
- Alex.
- And they didn't love you.

06:30.510 --> 06:32.740
They loved your blood.
They fed on you.

06:32.946 --> 06:34.573
I fed them.

06:34.781 --> 06:36.806
My choice.

06:38.352 --> 06:41.412
My brothers, they brought me food
when I was hungry.

06:41.622 --> 06:45.388
So when they struck out
on a hunt, I fed them.

06:45.592 --> 06:47.253
They're my family.

06:47.461 --> 06:52.660
Okay, you care about them,
but, Alex,

06:53.000 --> 06:56.231
there's a reason
you decided to run away.

06:57.604 --> 07:01.165
It was time to move on
and get out on my own.

07:01.375 --> 07:03.002
And how do you think that decision
is gonna sit

07:03.210 --> 07:04.973
with the rest of the nest?

07:05.178 --> 07:06.611
One of them already pursued you.

07:06.813 --> 07:08.933
You think when the rest of them
find out that you left

07:09.082 --> 07:11.312
that they're just gonna shrug
and cut their losses?

07:11.518 --> 07:13.758
You lived with them for years.
They've tasted your blood.

07:13.954 --> 07:15.979
They have your scent down cold.

07:16.189 --> 07:19.317
I mean, how far can you run
and for how long?

07:21.895 --> 07:24.125
You didn't think this out, did you?

07:24.331 --> 07:27.528
What would happen,
who might get hurt,

07:27.734 --> 07:30.703
your, uh, "brother," for one.

07:32.873 --> 07:35.000
His name's Cody.

07:36.710 --> 07:39.042
And she killed him.

07:39.246 --> 07:42.113
Because of a choice you made.

07:42.316 --> 07:44.876
These are the consequences.

07:45.085 --> 07:49.647
You got two options.
Them or you.

07:49.856 --> 07:52.984
And we can help you. We can keep you
safe. But you have to help us.

07:53.193 --> 07:55.286
Where's the nest?

07:57.698 --> 07:58.960
I can't.

08:03.303 --> 08:05.430
After what's happened...

08:07.741 --> 08:10.642
...Mama finds me, she'll kill me.

08:28.128 --> 08:30.289
- Mills, you okay?
- No wonder she didn't thank me.

08:30.497 --> 08:31.964
That creep was her brother.

08:33.400 --> 08:37.097
I'm fine. You know, mostly,
I'm just... I'm hung up on the name.

08:37.304 --> 08:40.432
Alex and Annie, they're so close already.
Why'd they change it?

08:40.640 --> 08:43.336
Okay, so we know from her ticket

08:43.543 --> 08:45.408
that Alex hopped a bus out
of O'Neill, Nebraska, right?

08:45.612 --> 08:47.052
- Mm-hmm.
- Obviously, it'd be better

08:47.080 --> 08:48.707
to go in with a firm location,
but the town ain't that big.

08:48.915 --> 08:50.875
There are no caves
or other natural hiding places.

08:50.917 --> 08:52.397
All right, so go in, canvass it cold.

08:52.552 --> 08:55.919
Well, I worked together a short list
of possible nest locations.

08:56.123 --> 08:59.217
There's an empty fire station,
four or five derelict homes.

08:59.426 --> 09:02.327
- Nothing we couldn't hit in a day.
- Okay.

09:04.865 --> 09:06.958
You sure you're all right
to babysit by yourself?

09:07.167 --> 09:10.864
Oh, well, girl's a flight risk,
not exactly friendly,

09:11.071 --> 09:12.791
but I think I can handle
babysitting detail.

09:12.973 --> 09:15.734
The station's been made. It might
be worth heading upwind for a while.

09:15.809 --> 09:18.369
- I mean, vamps are trackers.
- Terrific.

09:18.578 --> 09:19.738
Yeah.

09:19.946 --> 09:22.437
Well, I've got an old
family cabin outside of town.

09:22.649 --> 09:25.049
- That'll work.
- Okay. Well, shouldn't raise

09:25.252 --> 09:26.932
too many eyebrows,
me being gone for a day.

09:26.987 --> 09:28.955
Maybe, but you sure you
don't want backup?

09:29.156 --> 09:34.025
You want me to enlist my men in
a protection detail against vampires?

09:34.795 --> 09:37.161
Frank's still in the dark
about what hit him last night.

09:37.364 --> 09:41.095
The guy still has nightmares about
the barn episode of Walking Dead.

09:42.035 --> 09:44.060
They're good cops.
They're not ready for this.

09:44.271 --> 09:46.552
Jody, in your late-night reading,
did you ever come across

09:46.606 --> 09:47.886
anything about Dead Man's blood?

09:48.842 --> 09:51.743
It takes vamps down
like a horse tranq.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.809
I would not say no to some of that.

09:55.315 --> 09:56.282
I mean, not that I'll need it.

09:56.483 --> 09:59.748
You guys are gonna get the jump
on these vamps and be back here

09:59.953 --> 10:01.993
before they even realize
their kin's missing, right?

10:21.708 --> 10:23.699
Well, it's not my fault.

10:23.910 --> 10:26.936
Well, Ralph didn't show up for work today.
I had to pull a double shift.

10:28.448 --> 10:30.279
I'll be home soon.

10:40.360 --> 10:41.657
- Connor, you scared the...
- I'm sorry.

10:41.862 --> 10:43.542
I shouldn't have
snuck up on you like that.

10:44.531 --> 10:46.692
It's just, you haven't
seen Alex around, have you?

10:46.900 --> 10:51.166
Your sister.
No, I can't say I have. Sorry.

10:51.371 --> 10:54.067
So you didn't sell her
a bus ticket out of town?

10:55.842 --> 10:57.810
Did I help your shut-in kid sister

10:58.011 --> 11:01.811
get away from her weird,
scary-ass squatter family?

11:02.015 --> 11:05.712
- Answer's still no.
- So you're saying Ralph lied to us?

11:07.154 --> 11:10.885
'Cause he said...
that you sold her a ticket.

11:12.893 --> 11:14.451
Right before we killed him.

11:25.438 --> 11:27.463
You calling my family weird?

11:28.675 --> 11:31.473
Oh, honey, you have no idea.

11:55.702 --> 11:56.828
What?

11:57.037 --> 11:58.698
Too rustic for your taste?

12:01.408 --> 12:04.502
Well, I have a lot of great memories.
Used to come up here all the time.

12:04.711 --> 12:08.442
First as a kid with my parents,
and then with my...

12:12.018 --> 12:15.977
Anyhow, it's a lot nicer
than it looks from the outside.

12:27.701 --> 12:29.896
FYI, the woods around here,

12:30.103 --> 12:32.628
really easy to get lost in
if you don't know your way around.

12:32.839 --> 12:36.002
Me, I know them
like the back of my hand.

12:36.209 --> 12:39.610
I got it. "Don't try running.
You won't get far."

12:56.563 --> 12:58.292
You know this doesn't work, right?

12:58.498 --> 13:02.901
- On vampires? It's useless.
- That's not why I have it.

13:06.940 --> 13:09.932
- This your family?
- Yes.

13:11.845 --> 13:12.869
Where are they?

13:16.483 --> 13:17.609
Oh. Dead.

13:19.486 --> 13:22.853
You know, there are about a thousand
more polite ways you could say that.

13:23.056 --> 13:25.856
I'll give you a pass, on account of
the whole raised-by-monsters thing.

13:27.560 --> 13:32.156
- How'd they die?
- Horribly.

13:36.603 --> 13:38.036
You must be exhausted.

13:38.238 --> 13:39.762
I know for a fact
you didn't sleep last night.

13:39.973 --> 13:41.463
I'm fine.

13:41.675 --> 13:43.115
It's no problem.
I can make up a bed.

13:44.444 --> 13:45.843
I'm fine.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.642
Suit yourself.

14:31.624 --> 14:33.182
This place is in foreclosure, right?

14:33.393 --> 14:36.021
Yep. It is,
just like the rest of them.

14:36.229 --> 14:37.787
Well, somebody's squatting here.

14:37.997 --> 14:39.259
Blackout windows.

14:55.482 --> 14:56.915
Hey!

14:57.717 --> 14:59.275
Hey, you need a hand with that?

15:02.322 --> 15:05.120
Oh.
I guess not.

15:13.967 --> 15:16.834
You go out with the family,
bring home a nice dinner.

15:17.036 --> 15:19.061
How did you get stuck
doing the dishes?

15:19.272 --> 15:21.035
We all have our roles to play.

15:21.241 --> 15:23.141
Yours being destroying
the evidence, yeah?

15:24.511 --> 15:26.638
Nice job.

15:26.846 --> 15:29.280
Ralph Hedges. Stacy Kepler.

15:29.482 --> 15:34.818
- Any reason you targeted them?
- Yeah. Hunger.

15:35.555 --> 15:38.649
And, so, the family's what,
out taking a nice after-dinner stroll?

15:38.858 --> 15:42.021
Oh, I'm sure they'll
be back real soon.

15:45.331 --> 15:49.734
What I asked was...
where are they?

16:06.085 --> 16:07.916
Nice shiner.

16:09.255 --> 16:10.916
Can I help you all with something?

16:11.791 --> 16:13.520
As a matter of fact...

16:14.761 --> 16:16.251
...I think you can.

16:20.567 --> 16:22.967
You don't want to talk.
No skin off my back.

16:23.169 --> 16:26.002
'Cause you see, a blood-sucking,
body-chipping vamp,

16:26.206 --> 16:28.470
that's bad enough,

16:28.675 --> 16:32.270
but vamps that kidnap kids...

16:32.479 --> 16:35.937
Well, I'm going to enjoy
putting you down.

16:38.051 --> 16:41.612
Of course. Oh, I knew this
was about Alexis.

16:44.157 --> 16:47.649
I warned Mama that girl would screw
everything up for us one day.

16:47.861 --> 16:52.491
Mama?
As in one vamp turned you all?

16:52.699 --> 16:56.191
Well, all of us, but little sis.

16:56.402 --> 16:59.132
She was "too good to turn."

17:00.807 --> 17:03.970
Mama couldn't bring herself to,
no matter what we said,

17:04.176 --> 17:07.169
- no matter how bad Alexis got.
- Bad?

17:07.380 --> 17:11.009
Let me guess.
You never had a teenage sister.

17:11.217 --> 17:15.744
Dragging her heels,
whining, near constant,

17:15.954 --> 17:19.982
about everything,
but more and more about the blood,

17:20.193 --> 17:22.684
like she's somehow above it,

17:22.896 --> 17:25.364
like she's better than us
'cause she don't feed on people.

17:25.565 --> 17:27.464
She is better than you, dumbass!

17:27.666 --> 17:33.299
Her moping?
That teenage crisis-of-conscience crap?

17:33.506 --> 17:37.169
It's annoying as hell,
but it's just an act.

17:37.377 --> 17:43.316
When the chips are down,
she'll always choose us over humans.

17:48.788 --> 17:53.555
I mean, how do you think we stayed
off your radar all these years?

17:54.928 --> 17:58.364
Pretty, young,
lost-looking thing like her?

17:58.565 --> 18:03.025
Irresistible, especially to the kind
of man few people would miss.

18:23.723 --> 18:25.486
I mean, sure,
we hunt sometimes for sport,

18:25.692 --> 18:30.061
but it's a lot easier
and a lot safer to get delivery.

18:33.499 --> 18:35.262
Come on, sweetie.

18:37.070 --> 18:39.436
Aren't you gonna give me a name?

18:41.874 --> 18:44.638
It's Ann.

18:44.877 --> 18:47.812
Mm. Sweet Ann.

18:48.781 --> 18:51.511
You got any idea
what I'm about to do to you?

18:51.718 --> 18:54.209
Yeah, I do.

18:58.491 --> 19:00.186
Nothing.

19:01.561 --> 19:04.758
What the...
Is this a party?

19:13.306 --> 19:16.537
- She's your lure.
- Best a vamp could ask for.

19:18.611 --> 19:22.308
And you better believe you don't get
that good at it unless you enjoy it.

19:22.515 --> 19:24.642
In her own sweet way,

19:24.851 --> 19:28.446
girl's as bloodthirsty
as any vampire.

19:33.426 --> 19:35.519
Jody.

19:47.073 --> 19:49.132
Alex?

19:49.342 --> 19:51.105
Alex?

19:58.451 --> 20:00.146
Alex?

20:44.130 --> 20:46.621
- Easy.
- Sorry.

20:46.833 --> 20:48.562
It's all right.

20:51.738 --> 20:55.071
I made you a sandwich.
It's out there if you want it.

20:59.712 --> 21:01.009
Sheriff.

21:04.684 --> 21:06.311
My grandma?

21:08.421 --> 21:09.945
I'm so sorry.

21:11.691 --> 21:17.152
No, it's... it's fine. I figured,
it's been years, and she was old.

21:27.774 --> 21:29.901
You got it. Thank you.

21:30.109 --> 21:31.109
She's not answering.

21:31.277 --> 21:33.438
I just ran the victims' names
through local PD.

21:33.646 --> 21:35.944
They both worked
at the O'Neill bus station.

21:36.149 --> 21:38.276
So they killed them
for Alex's location.

21:41.287 --> 21:42.845
- Jody?
- Dean, what's up?

21:43.055 --> 21:44.055
Listen to me.

21:44.223 --> 21:46.384
The vamps knew that Alex
went to Sioux Falls, okay?

21:46.592 --> 21:48.457
They're probably already there.
We're on our way there next.

21:48.661 --> 21:50.561
But there's something else.
There's something about Alex.

21:50.763 --> 21:52.458
It can wait.

21:55.234 --> 21:57.031
- They're here.
- What?

21:57.236 --> 21:58.464
At the cabin. Now.

21:58.671 --> 22:00.434
- We're on our way.
- Hurry.

22:01.340 --> 22:02.898
- She hung up.
- We moving?

22:03.109 --> 22:04.974
Yeah. Meet you outside.

22:20.059 --> 22:21.651
Alex?

22:21.861 --> 22:24.762
Alex, come on! We got to go!

22:25.231 --> 22:26.960
Jody!

22:27.133 --> 22:28.930
- We got to go!
- Jody, help!

22:29.135 --> 22:30.693
Alex?!

22:30.903 --> 22:32.768
Alex!

22:34.040 --> 22:36.668
- Alex!
- Help me! Help!

22:38.678 --> 22:40.612
Let me go!

22:49.055 --> 22:50.920
Come on, let's go!

22:52.191 --> 22:53.191
Move it!

23:12.378 --> 23:15.313
Jody? Hey, you okay?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:15.514 --> 23:18.142
- Where's Alex?
- You tell us.

23:18.351 --> 23:20.911
- They came, and I tried to stop them.
- And you got knocked out.

23:20.920 --> 23:23.320
- Well, happens to the best of us.
- Just lucky you're alive.

23:23.522 --> 23:25.513
You think they went back
to the nest?

23:25.725 --> 23:26.749
Of course they did.
Why wouldn't they?

23:26.959 --> 23:29.154
Question is, what are they gonna do
when they find their brother dead?

23:29.362 --> 23:32.820
- So we go back now.
- Okay. I'm coming.

23:33.032 --> 23:35.865
Jody? Hey, hey. Whoa.
Hold on. You're hurt.

23:36.068 --> 23:37.788
- I'm coming.
- Jody, we can handle the nest

23:37.904 --> 23:40.464
- on our own.
- I don't give a fig about the nest.

23:40.673 --> 23:42.033
That girl was under my protection.

23:42.108 --> 23:46.636
Okay, that girl can't be trusted.
She's a lure. She's a honey trap.

23:46.846 --> 23:50.805
She's been feeding people
to those vamps!

23:51.017 --> 23:53.611
I don't care. Whatever she did,
she did because they made her.

23:53.819 --> 23:56.083
- Oh, and that's a reason?
- She's a kid!

23:56.289 --> 23:58.049
Yeah, a kid who's been
playing vampire murder

23:58.224 --> 24:00.692
- since before she was in braces.
- Jody, he's right.

24:00.893 --> 24:04.659
At best, her loyalties are screwed.

24:04.864 --> 24:06.161
And how do you even know
she wants to be saved?

24:06.299 --> 24:07.527
For the past eight years,

24:07.733 --> 24:10.258
she has been baiting the hook
for an entire nest.

24:10.469 --> 24:12.869
She's got more blood on her hands
than most monsters we kill.

24:13.072 --> 24:16.269
- Are you saying she's on your list?
- No, we're not saying that.

24:16.475 --> 24:18.375
Well, not yet.

24:20.646 --> 24:22.375
Look, it sucks, okay?
It does.

24:22.581 --> 24:25.243
But with hunting monsters
comes harsh truths.

24:25.451 --> 24:27.885
This is a clean-up mission.
It's not a rescue.

24:28.087 --> 24:31.318
What is this even really about?
You barely know the girl.

24:34.093 --> 24:35.185
I'm coming.

24:35.394 --> 24:38.090
And if either one of you lays
so much as a hand on Alex,

24:38.297 --> 24:41.323
you'll have to go through me.

24:49.308 --> 24:53.574
Put up quite a struggle with Connor.
Says you nearly took his eye out.

24:55.147 --> 24:59.379
Maybe that was just his excuse
for knocking you out.

25:01.854 --> 25:04.254
You have any idea
the mess you made?

25:05.825 --> 25:08.350
Hunters raided the place
while we were out,

25:08.561 --> 25:11.394
tortured and killed Dale.

25:12.465 --> 25:14.695
Our home's been made.

25:14.900 --> 25:17.300
We're gonna have to move again.

25:17.503 --> 25:20.495
Mama, I never meant...

25:22.641 --> 25:25.804
We will all find our way.

25:27.380 --> 25:30.042
Things got screwy...

25:32.284 --> 25:34.252
...but you're back now.

25:34.453 --> 25:37.911
Why? After everything,
I thought that you...

25:38.124 --> 25:39.955
You thought what?

25:40.159 --> 25:42.957
That I'd hurt you?
Kill you?

25:50.302 --> 25:52.736
I would never hurt you.

25:54.407 --> 25:57.103
Not my baby girl,
not my sweet Alex.

25:57.309 --> 25:59.709
How could you even think that?

26:01.714 --> 26:06.549
Baby, why did you do it?
Why did you run from us?

26:07.920 --> 26:09.547
I love you, Mama.

26:09.755 --> 26:12.019
I do. I just...

26:12.224 --> 26:14.658
I couldn't take it anymore.

26:16.328 --> 26:19.456
The blood and the death,

26:19.665 --> 26:20.962
the sounds of their screams.

26:21.167 --> 26:24.830
I just...
I can't do it anymore.

26:26.038 --> 26:30.998
And the way I feel afterwards,
the guilt...

26:33.946 --> 26:37.313
I'd rather die
than feel that way again.

26:42.388 --> 26:45.687
- It's my fault.
- What?

26:45.891 --> 26:49.019
All of it.
This is my fault.

26:49.228 --> 26:52.061
I should've turned you years ago.

27:01.240 --> 27:04.073
Well, their truck's
in the driveway.

27:04.276 --> 27:06.107
So we're walking right into it.

27:06.312 --> 27:08.746
- Well, we've faced worse odds.
- Yeah.

27:08.948 --> 27:10.575
Jody.

27:10.783 --> 27:15.243
This is a raid,
so tread lightly, stay close.

27:15.454 --> 27:18.855
Priority is clearing the nest.
Alex comes second. You got it?

27:21.594 --> 27:22.754
Got it.

27:28.601 --> 27:30.762
It was so selfish.

27:30.970 --> 27:33.234
I wanted to watch you grow up.

27:33.439 --> 27:35.407
I kept putting it off.
Don't you see?

27:35.608 --> 27:37.667
These things you've been feeling,

27:37.877 --> 27:43.008
all the guilt and suffering,
those are human feelings.

27:43.916 --> 27:47.408
It ain't too late.
I can take the pain away.

27:49.188 --> 27:52.885
And then we can stay together,

27:53.092 --> 27:55.822
as a family.

27:56.028 --> 27:59.327
Like none of this ever happened.

28:01.066 --> 28:03.728
Wouldn't you like that?

30:04.423 --> 30:05.754
Drop it.

30:25.811 --> 30:27.531
Alex, come on.
Come on, honey. We got to go.

30:27.546 --> 30:29.070
- Go away!
- We got to go!

30:31.650 --> 30:34.619
- What did they do to you?
- I'm sorry, Jody.

30:34.820 --> 30:37.448
I made my choice.

30:41.160 --> 30:43.754
She chose me.

30:51.904 --> 30:52.904
No, no, no. No.

30:55.941 --> 30:58.000
Hell of a sight to come home to.

30:59.211 --> 31:01.111
Brother lying dead on the floor.

31:04.149 --> 31:06.947
No idea it was a Winchester
that had done it.

31:08.354 --> 31:11.289
So... which one of you was it?

31:11.490 --> 31:15.392
Which one of you took off
my brother's head?!

31:16.729 --> 31:18.128
Was it you?

31:19.698 --> 31:20.858
Was it him?

31:30.376 --> 31:34.039
Pretty fitting...
brother for a brother.

31:36.849 --> 31:40.046
This place has been
a good home to us.

31:40.252 --> 31:43.847
But since you two had
to come around and ruin it,

31:44.056 --> 31:46.096
we're gonna have to hit the road
and find a new one.

31:51.263 --> 31:53.128
And when we hit the road...

31:56.468 --> 31:58.459
...we like to pack a lunch.

32:06.445 --> 32:08.174
Can't say you didn't come prepared.

32:08.380 --> 32:10.905
- Alex.
- Hey!

32:11.116 --> 32:14.608
Don't be bothering my girl.
She's going through something, a process.

32:16.388 --> 32:19.551
- What did you do to her?
- Fed her my blood.

32:19.758 --> 32:24.422
She's on her way now.
All that's left is to feed.

32:30.068 --> 32:31.695
Please, Mama.

32:33.772 --> 32:35.501
Let her go.

32:37.943 --> 32:39.672
I already drank from you.

32:39.878 --> 32:41.402
Let her go.

32:41.613 --> 32:44.912
Made an impression on my girl, I see.

32:45.117 --> 32:48.314
Baby, this is the human half
of you talking.

32:48.520 --> 32:51.751
After the change, this human,
she ain't nothing to you.

32:51.957 --> 32:53.822
Clearly, Sheriff, you got issues,

32:54.026 --> 32:57.518
some hole in your life
you're using my Alex to fill.

32:57.729 --> 32:59.697
I would say go
and get a family of your own,

32:59.898 --> 33:03.197
but, well, you know.

33:03.402 --> 33:05.302
Wow. That's pretty rich
coming from the woman

33:05.504 --> 33:07.404
who stole Alex to begin with.

33:07.606 --> 33:13.374
I have fed her, clothed her,
loved her going on nine years.

33:13.579 --> 33:16.309
You think motherhood's
just about blood?

33:16.515 --> 33:17.641
You don't know the first thing
about it.

33:17.850 --> 33:20.375
Maybe not,
but I know what it isn't.

33:20.586 --> 33:23.521
And it ain't about forcing her
to be like you

33:23.722 --> 33:26.156
the second she becomes inconvenient.

33:29.761 --> 33:31.729
Don't you see
what she is trying to do?

33:31.930 --> 33:35.297
This hunter-cop bitch
is trying to turn you against me

33:35.501 --> 33:40.097
to save her own hide.
Don't believe a word she says.

33:43.375 --> 33:45.468
She ain't your mother.

34:01.527 --> 34:04.519
Tapped this keg.
Get the short-hair one ready.

34:30.789 --> 34:33.553
- Time to finish this.
- Alex!

34:34.826 --> 34:36.760
Was that her name?

34:38.397 --> 34:40.864
You named her after someone.

34:43.235 --> 34:45.362
Was it your daughter?

34:48.540 --> 34:51.007
I couldn't figure out
why you changed her name.

34:51.208 --> 34:54.701
I thought maybe you were ashamed
of your theft, but you have no shame.

34:54.913 --> 34:57.746
You said that I was using her
to fill a hole in my life,

34:57.950 --> 35:00.145
and you're right, I am.

35:01.453 --> 35:03.011
You are, too.

35:05.223 --> 35:06.918
Mama?

35:07.125 --> 35:10.322
I guess it takes one to know one.

35:10.529 --> 35:12.656
That Alex,

35:12.864 --> 35:17.733
she died a long time ago.

35:17.936 --> 35:20.097
And it still hurts.

35:23.008 --> 35:26.500
You still feel it.
Loss, pain,

35:26.712 --> 35:29.579
like a stone in your gut.

35:29.781 --> 35:33.012
It hurts just a little bit less
whenever she's near.

35:39.658 --> 35:40.955
You bitch.

36:10.522 --> 36:11.682
Look at me.

36:14.126 --> 36:15.821
Look at me, bitch!

36:34.846 --> 36:36.370
- Dean.
- Yeah, I know.

36:36.581 --> 36:37.809
You wouldn't have done
the same for me.

36:38.016 --> 36:40.985
No. Jody.

36:46.024 --> 36:48.083
Good news, lady cop.

36:52.164 --> 36:57.602
Whoever you lost,
you're gonna see them again real soon.

37:09.548 --> 37:11.379
Alex?

37:20.525 --> 37:22.459
How could you?

37:26.164 --> 37:28.223
You were my girl.

37:31.403 --> 37:33.667
I'm sorry, Mama.

37:41.012 --> 37:42.741
Don't watch this, sweetheart.

38:07.639 --> 38:10.301
Nice work back there.

38:10.509 --> 38:12.773
"Look at me, bitch?"

38:12.978 --> 38:15.640
Well, hey, you got another
snappy one-liner, I'm all ears.

38:15.847 --> 38:20.477
What I'm saying is, it looked to me
like you were enjoying it.

38:20.685 --> 38:23.950
- Maybe too much.
- And?

38:25.223 --> 38:27.453
Well, sorry for not
putting on a hair shirt.

38:27.659 --> 38:32.323
Killing things that need killing
is kind of our job.

38:34.332 --> 38:37.233
Last I checked, taking pleasure
in that is not a crime.

38:38.537 --> 38:39.663
Right, but...

38:41.006 --> 38:43.133
How's things back at the station?

38:43.341 --> 38:47.038
Well, they beat Frank up pretty bad,
but at least they left him alive.

38:47.245 --> 38:49.839
He kept apologizing for spilling
the beans about the cabin,

38:50.048 --> 38:51.640
but I told him that one's on me.

38:52.784 --> 38:57.050
Well, speaking of apologies,
we owe you a big one.

38:57.255 --> 38:59.587
We were wrong about the girl.

39:00.926 --> 39:04.293
No. You were right, about me.

39:04.496 --> 39:07.863
My judgment was clouded.

39:08.066 --> 39:12.435
You know, working this case,
it brought feelings back.

39:13.905 --> 39:16.738
Feelings I've been trying
to bury for years,

39:16.942 --> 39:20.935
you know, buried it under work,
religion,

39:21.146 --> 39:23.614
even dating.
We know how that worked out.

39:24.783 --> 39:28.776
But, you know, it was still there,
you know, underneath.

39:30.388 --> 39:31.753
The grief.

39:34.426 --> 39:37.122
Don't know what that means for me,
just that I've been...

39:37.329 --> 39:41.629
I've been fooling myself
to think that I could ignore it.

39:41.833 --> 39:46.964
Anyway, thank you,
for coming out, for curing Alex.

39:47.172 --> 39:49.606
You don't need to thank us.

39:49.808 --> 39:52.800
I mean, you're the one
who killed her sire, got her blood.

39:55.580 --> 39:57.377
Sure it'll work?

39:57.582 --> 40:01.177
Well, speaking from experience,
it'll be a rough couple of days,

40:01.386 --> 40:05.482
but she should pull through.
You sure you don't want us to stay?

40:06.791 --> 40:09.055
I'm good.

40:09.261 --> 40:13.197
After it's done,
you know what to do with her?

40:28.780 --> 40:32.443
- Don't get up on account of me.
- I'm... I'm hot.

40:33.785 --> 40:36.583
- Should I grab a...
- I'll just be cold again in a second.

40:36.788 --> 40:39.348
It's part of the cure, I guess.

40:39.557 --> 40:42.958
- You want something to eat?
- No, I'll just throw it up.

40:43.161 --> 40:45.391
But thank you.

40:49.901 --> 40:52.961
I want you to know that,

40:53.171 --> 40:55.833
when Mama offered, I just...

40:57.709 --> 41:00.371
I couldn't disappoint her again.

41:07.886 --> 41:10.719
I had enough to be ashamed of
as it is.

41:14.292 --> 41:16.192
Jody, I've done things.

41:16.394 --> 41:19.227
You don't have to explain.
I know.

41:22.267 --> 41:24.701
Whatever you want from me,
I'll give it.

41:24.903 --> 41:27.235
If you want, I'm here.

41:31.209 --> 41:34.701
But what you've been
through the last 48 alone,

41:34.913 --> 41:36.904
losing your entire family,

41:37.115 --> 41:40.414
everything you've ever known
or loved,

41:40.618 --> 41:43.712
no one can understand that.

41:46.691 --> 41:48.249
You can.
