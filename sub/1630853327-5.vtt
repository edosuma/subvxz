[Maya] <i>He was dropped off</i>
<i>at his home yesterday evening.</i>

00:23.231 --> 00:26.526
<i>Before he was kidnapped,</i>
<i>Marty told me he was willing to cooperate.</i>

00:27.444 --> 00:29.696
I think he'd be an incredible asset.

00:30.613 --> 00:32.157
He had an agent killed.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.242
We don't know that.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.326
[Evans] You...

00:35.827 --> 00:37.328
You don't seem to know that.

00:37.787 --> 00:40.749
[Maya] <i>It could take years</i>
<i>to pull together a credible case on him.</i>

00:40.832 --> 00:42.792
<i>If he cooperates,</i>

00:42.876 --> 00:45.003
we could stop him from laundering
for the Navarro cartel

00:45.086 --> 00:47.088
and have him working for us
in over 18 months.

00:47.172 --> 00:50.508
[Evans] Agent Petty offered him WITSEC.
He didn't want it.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.552
[Maya] <i>I'm not talking witness protection.</i>

00:53.219 --> 00:55.055
<i>This is a deal to work with us.</i>

00:55.847 --> 00:57.348
[woman] <i>You think he's that good?</i>

00:57.432 --> 01:00.477
[Maya] <i>We've known what he's done</i>
<i>for years. We still can't prove it, so...</i>

01:00.894 --> 01:02.645
Yeah, he's that good.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.065
[Evans] We need to take him down.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.484
That much was obvious to Agent Petty.

01:07.567 --> 01:08.735
It is to me, too.

01:08.818 --> 01:12.197
And if you think different,
you're being very naive.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.365
All due respect,

01:14.949 --> 01:16.785
Agent Petty was heavy-handed,

01:17.410 --> 01:18.661
and he broke the law,

01:19.245 --> 01:22.665
not to mention ignoring every rule we have
for handling CIs.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.793
I don't think we should
go down that road again.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.755
I've built rapport with Marty.

01:28.838 --> 01:30.131
He wants out.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.887
-Next moves?
-This is a mistake.

01:36.721 --> 01:38.640
Give me time to get close to him.

01:39.516 --> 01:41.643
We don't know who came back from Mexico.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.770
<i>He's probably been tortured.</i>

01:45.021 --> 01:47.023
<i>It could have unpredictable effects.</i>

01:48.149 --> 01:51.194
<i>He's likely to be volatile, emotional.</i>

01:52.529 --> 01:55.198
<i>If we're lucky,</i>
<i>he could be ready to break.</i>

03:00.180 --> 03:02.307
[food sizzling in kitchen]

03:02.390 --> 03:04.475
[low, indistinct conversation]

03:06.144 --> 03:08.646
[indistinct clattering in kitchen]

03:16.154 --> 03:18.489
-[Charlotte] Are you okay?
-[food sizzling]

03:18.823 --> 03:21.576
Shouldn't you see a doctor?
Go to the hospital?

03:21.659 --> 03:24.120
-[utensil clinks against pan]
-You've lost weight.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.623
I'm fine. They gave me rice and beans.

03:28.374 --> 03:29.959
So they had the lights on the whole time?

03:30.335 --> 03:32.754
[Marty] Yeah, they were stadium lights.
It was terrible.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.590
Hey.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.176
Call me if you need anything.

03:38.259 --> 03:39.219
[Marty] Yeah, they did.

03:39.802 --> 03:40.803
Morning.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.514
[Wendy chuckles] God, you cleaned.

03:44.140 --> 03:45.308
When did you get up?

03:45.475 --> 03:47.810
Uh, about 5:30.
Sit. I'll bring you some coffee.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.687
[Charlotte] Dad made everything.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.234
[Jonah] What else did they do to you?

03:55.318 --> 03:59.155
Uh, seriously, guys, they just asked me
a bunch of questions. I am fine.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.866
I'm okay, and just be happy that I'm back.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.743
Uh, Wendy, I will see you at the office.

04:03.826 --> 04:07.163
I set an appointment with, uh,
Helen and Ruth for 10:30.

04:07.747 --> 04:09.249
You don't have to go in today.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.960
No, we can handle things. Take a day!

04:12.043 --> 04:13.169
Don't be late.

04:15.129 --> 04:17.382
-Do you need me to come in today?
-No.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.802
-[door shuts]
-No, take the week off.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.514
Is Dad really okay?

04:24.597 --> 04:25.515
Yeah.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.517
Yeah, he's fine. He's...

04:27.934 --> 04:28.893
[car door closes]

04:30.144 --> 04:32.772
-...just settling in.
-[engine starts]

04:39.195 --> 04:40.822
[cell phone chiming]

04:46.202 --> 04:47.578
[chiming]

04:50.540 --> 04:51.582
Fuck.

05:03.511 --> 05:04.595
[whispers] Shit.

05:04.679 --> 05:05.847
[sighing]

05:12.854 --> 05:13.771
Breakfast?

05:16.524 --> 05:18.651
Look, I know I kissed you last night,

05:18.735 --> 05:21.070
but I thought I was gonna fucking die.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.866
This isn't about a kiss.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.411
I didn't see you eat
for five days straight.

05:30.121 --> 05:31.956
And I was serious last night.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.500
My family shouldn't have
dragged you into this.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.337
I've only known you
for five fucking minutes.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.131
I was a criminal
long before Marty Byrde showed up

05:40.214 --> 05:42.383
with a bag full of cartel cash.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.260
So spare me your fucking pity.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.102
-It's not pity.
-[engine starts]

05:53.603 --> 05:55.480
I just think you deserve better.

05:56.731 --> 05:59.567
I think you're pretty spectacular,
to be honest.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.111
Now eat your burrito.

06:15.249 --> 06:17.418
I prefer French toast sticks.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.677
Wendy, how much are you guys smurfing
each day?

06:27.345 --> 06:29.597
-Ninety thousand.
-Okay. How many smurfs?

06:30.223 --> 06:31.140
-Twenty.
-Mmm.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.476
They're-- They're in rotation, ten a day.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.562
They bring in ten grand, they lose nine,
they keep one,

06:36.646 --> 06:39.315
and no one works more than three days
in a row. Ruth knows them all.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.984
-Including your brother-in-law.
-What's that?

06:43.069 --> 06:44.153
He wanted to help.

06:44.570 --> 06:45.738
Come on.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.199
Any of these smurfs
look like they have a job?

06:48.950 --> 06:50.743
-Not nine grand a day jobs.
-[Ruth] Marty!

06:50.827 --> 06:52.787
-I'm so sorry.
-Yeah, that's what I was worried--

06:52.870 --> 06:55.706
It's my fucking fault.
I never should've said that I can do it.

06:55.790 --> 06:58.126
It's all right, Ruth. Don't worry.
Please sit. It's okay.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.962
You didn't do anything wrong. Don't worry.
Go ahead, sit down.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.630
Everybody did what they had to. I get it.

07:02.713 --> 07:04.882
The important thing
is that we just back on track today.

07:04.966 --> 07:05.842
So, first thing.

07:05.925 --> 07:09.220
Ruth, I need you to set up lines of credit
today at the casino.

07:09.303 --> 07:12.014
We're gonna lend the smurfs
some money that they're losing,

07:12.098 --> 07:13.599
make it look a little bit more legit

07:13.683 --> 07:15.852
and give us some cover
in the short-term. Okay?

07:15.977 --> 07:17.520
Frank Jr. won't like it.

07:18.396 --> 07:19.397
He won't? Why not?

07:19.522 --> 07:22.150
He's been loansharking at the Belle
since we opened.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.652
I don't know if we want to piss him off.

07:24.735 --> 07:25.903
[stammers] Hang on one second.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.406
Who approved that
with all the feds around?

07:29.991 --> 07:33.035
Jesus Christ, end that. Today.
Tell him that I said so.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.787
I don't give a fuck
if I piss that guy off.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.956
Bigger issue is we started smurfing
in the first place.

07:37.039 --> 07:40.293
We gotta phase that out gently
while keeping our handle up. 

07:40.376 --> 07:42.587
We don't wanna raise suspicion. Okay?

07:42.670 --> 07:45.923
-How do you plan on doing that?
-I've met Agent Miller. She's clever.

07:46.048 --> 07:48.050
[Marty] Ideally, we find someone
with a lot of money

07:48.134 --> 07:51.637
who won't mind losing it
and trusts us to give it back.

07:56.225 --> 07:58.311
Yeah, but it's my inheritance.

07:58.853 --> 08:03.232
Which-- Which we'll return to you
with an extra 8%.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.235
Now, that's... that's a really good deal.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.280
I mean, if you need the money,
I can loan it to you.

08:09.405 --> 08:13.451
[stammers]
No, it's more of a cash flow problem.

08:13.534 --> 08:15.870
We need to raise the handle
at the Missouri Belle

08:15.953 --> 08:18.247
to get another line of credit.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.500
And by the time summer's over, it'll...

08:20.583 --> 08:21.751
We'll all be fine.

08:22.835 --> 08:26.464
Yeah, I don't know, Wendy.
I'm happy with the way things are.

08:29.342 --> 08:32.553
Hasn't life gotten better for you
since we met? Hmm?

08:33.054 --> 08:36.724
I mean, haven't I always pointed you
in the right direction?

08:36.807 --> 08:39.185
You have more money. You have a job.

08:39.268 --> 08:40.645
You met Jade.

08:40.728 --> 08:42.230
[laughs] Yeah. Uh...

08:43.731 --> 08:45.942
Actually gonna ask her to marry me.

08:46.400 --> 08:48.569
That is great news.

08:48.694 --> 08:51.989
-A little nervous, but you know.
-That's great. And you know what?

08:52.615 --> 08:53.699
I-- I bet...

08:54.534 --> 08:57.328
she'd love to watch you play high roller
for a couple of weeks.

08:58.996 --> 09:00.873
I mean, is this-- is this illegal?

09:00.957 --> 09:01.874
No.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.960
No, no, no, no, no.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.295
It's...

09:07.171 --> 09:09.340
unethical, maybe.

09:09.423 --> 09:11.300
But all you've gotta do is lose
and you can...

09:11.384 --> 09:13.511
-[cell phone ringing]
-You can do that now, can't you?

09:14.095 --> 09:15.471
Uh, yeah.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.306
So, is that a yes?

09:18.140 --> 09:19.016
-Yes.
-Great.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.768
Great. I'm sorry, I have to get this.

09:20.893 --> 09:21.978
Oh, yeah, sure.

09:30.820 --> 09:31.696
Hello?

09:32.446 --> 09:33.406
Wendy.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.032
How are you?

09:37.702 --> 09:39.287
Better. Thank you.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.582
It's been a very difficult time, I know,

09:42.665 --> 09:45.585
and I'm sorry that you had
to go through it.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.130
I appreciate that.

09:50.423 --> 09:54.176
I think you're going to be very pleased
because I have been thinking

09:54.635 --> 09:56.095
about the question you asked.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.431
"What's next?"

10:00.891 --> 10:02.768
<i>Do you know what a </i>charro<i> is, Wendy?</i>

10:07.273 --> 10:09.775
Uh, cowboy?

10:10.651 --> 10:12.194
<i>A Mexican cowboy.</i>

10:13.946 --> 10:15.323
And my grandfather, well...

10:16.699 --> 10:20.411
he was a <i>charro,</i>
and nothing would impress him more

10:20.494 --> 10:23.831
to know that I was the proud owner
of an American horse farm.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.459
<i>And it would make a beautiful piece</i>

10:26.542 --> 10:28.628
<i>in the legitimate empire</i>
<i>that you are building.</i>

10:30.421 --> 10:32.798
We can certainly start
to look into that right away.

10:33.424 --> 10:34.967
<i>I have one in mind already.</i>

10:36.636 --> 10:38.054
<i>The best one in Kentucky.</i>

10:39.138 --> 10:42.683
They're expecting a visit from you
this afternoon, and, Wendy...

10:42.767 --> 10:45.770
uh, this is the one I want, so...

10:46.520 --> 10:48.648
you and Marty, you must get it for me.

10:48.731 --> 10:49.732
<i>¿Sí?</i>

10:51.525 --> 10:52.610
Of course.

10:54.945 --> 10:56.989
Something is wrong. You're not happy.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.408
No, I am. Very.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.452
I just-- I just have...

11:03.245 --> 11:04.705
I just want to know...

11:06.040 --> 11:07.750
Why did you let Marty come home?

11:10.628 --> 11:12.672
Do you not want your husband back?

11:13.255 --> 11:15.800
No, of course I did.
We all did. It's just...

11:17.426 --> 11:19.136
We didn't pass your test.

11:19.595 --> 11:20.596
<i>Marty passed.</i>

11:20.721 --> 11:22.848
<i>I didn't know him, now I do,</i>

11:22.932 --> 11:25.768
and you're very lucky,
because he's just like me.

11:27.436 --> 11:28.270
How so?

11:29.021 --> 11:30.314
<i>He wants to win.</i>

11:30.398 --> 11:31.482
[call disconnects]

11:38.322 --> 11:40.324
[doorbell playing "Joy to the World"]

11:51.085 --> 11:53.087
-[Marty] Hi, there.
-[Sue] Hi.

11:55.756 --> 11:58.676
So, Marty,
what is it you wanted to talk about?

11:59.176 --> 12:02.012
<i>So, I need to hire someone new</i>
<i>at the casino.</i>

12:02.930 --> 12:04.056
<i>Uh, she's very talented.</i>

12:04.140 --> 12:08.352
<i>I think that she could give us a real edge</i>
<i>over the competition.</i>

12:09.311 --> 12:12.273
-That's wonderful.
-Mm-hmm. Yeah, but you know, uh,

12:12.356 --> 12:14.191
Wendy is gonna fight it.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.359
Thank you. Um...

12:15.735 --> 12:18.863
She's not in my corner,
and I need you to get her there.

12:19.321 --> 12:23.284
I always do what I can
to help her see your side, Marty.

12:23.367 --> 12:27.204
Mm-hmm. Well, do you, Sue? You know,
I'm not giving out participation medals.

12:27.288 --> 12:30.166
From now on, if you want your bonus,
you're gonna have to earn it.

12:30.249 --> 12:33.085
It's gonna be-- You listening?
It's gonna be $300...

12:33.544 --> 12:36.130
It's gonna be $300
if she is leaning my way.

12:36.213 --> 12:39.800
It's gonna be $800
if she commits in session.

12:41.051 --> 12:41.927
Good?

12:42.219 --> 12:45.514
Oh, well-- well, this is--

12:45.639 --> 12:48.809
We don't usually talk about sums.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.771
Mm-hmm. Listen, if you're uncomfortable
with our arrangement,

12:51.854 --> 12:52.897
why do you take my money?

12:55.691 --> 12:57.568
I suppose I want to see

12:58.027 --> 13:00.362
where your story ends.

13:01.197 --> 13:04.742
You play your cards right, it's gonna end
with you getting $800. Sound good?

13:08.704 --> 13:09.872
Have a cookie.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.582
They're homemade.

13:11.665 --> 13:14.502
They smell delicious,
but I'm gonna see myself out.

13:14.585 --> 13:15.795
You have a great day.

13:37.066 --> 13:40.152
Before you get your panties in a bunch,

13:40.653 --> 13:42.196
just listen. Okay?

13:42.321 --> 13:44.073
We're offering credit now,

13:44.156 --> 13:45.991
so you gotta stop your shit.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.577
What "shit" is that?

13:48.869 --> 13:50.830
The fucking loansharking shit.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.582
I don't lend money to guys
that can get credit.

13:54.416 --> 13:57.628
You do your thing, I'll do mine.
We can coexist.

13:57.711 --> 14:00.589
No, we can't.
This is coming from Marty.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.883
You gotta cease and fucking desist.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.844
It's fucking dumb anyhow.

14:06.011 --> 14:06.929
That right?

14:07.304 --> 14:10.683
Yeah.
Take it up with your daddy, if you want.

14:11.141 --> 14:14.103
I bet he wouldn't think
it's such a shit-hot idea

14:14.186 --> 14:17.398
for you to be knocking
some guy's teeth out in the restroom

14:17.481 --> 14:19.733
when the feds
are breathing down our necks.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.779
I bet he doesn't even fucking know.

14:27.616 --> 14:28.993
Any questions?

14:29.743 --> 14:31.620
-No.
-Good.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.331
Now, quit parking in the crippled spot.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.625
What you got ain't a disability.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.961
Just poor fucking judgment.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.257
[door opens]

14:47.344 --> 14:48.637
Good to have you back.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.601
How you feeling?

14:55.728 --> 14:57.938
I was worried about you.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.858
Why? I was on a business trip
in Kansas City.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.694
My offer still stands.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.155
I confirmed it this morning.

15:06.238 --> 15:09.575
Just say the word
and you have your life back.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.915
Look, unless it's about the audit,
I don't want to hear it.

15:16.957 --> 15:18.083
It's that bad.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.128
Sorry, Marty. I really am.

15:22.212 --> 15:23.255
And, um...

15:24.715 --> 15:26.300
don't go near my family again.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.223
[clears throat]
I'm gonna be out all afternoon.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.433
Try not to worry.

15:34.892 --> 15:35.809
[door shuts]

15:47.154 --> 15:48.072
What?

15:48.739 --> 15:50.282
He thinks you're alike.

15:50.574 --> 15:52.910
-[scoffs] He said that, huh?
-Yeah.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.372
What do you think he means?

15:56.956 --> 15:58.540
I have no idea.

16:06.382 --> 16:09.385
[horses whinnying]

16:22.940 --> 16:24.316
[Wendy] I can do the talking.

16:25.025 --> 16:27.236
[Marty] Don't worry. I want this, too.

16:46.880 --> 16:50.175
Give this guy some sweet feed.
He deserves it.

16:52.636 --> 16:53.846
-[Marty] Hi.
-[woman] Hi.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.597
-You must be Wendy.
-Hi.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.349
-Marty. Oly Brennan.
-Hi.

16:57.433 --> 17:00.227
Uh, this is just such a beautiful place.

17:00.310 --> 17:02.062
I really hope you'll let us
be a part of it.

17:02.146 --> 17:04.648
Me too. Let me show you around.

17:11.739 --> 17:15.242
She's so desperate for me to like her.
It's pathetic.

17:16.410 --> 17:19.204
Like, you're the one who packed me off
to boarding school when I was eight,

17:19.288 --> 17:20.914
and now you want to be friends?

17:21.540 --> 17:22.791
Fuck that. No.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.335
Woodlands is a good school.

17:25.461 --> 17:29.089
Yeah, if you like Jesus
and nothing happening to you.

17:31.508 --> 17:32.384
[sighs]

17:38.974 --> 17:40.184
[Tommy] Hey!

17:42.644 --> 17:44.980
-Did you invite them here?
-[noncommittal grunt]

17:45.105 --> 17:46.315
[Tommy] Hey!

17:46.732 --> 17:48.776
He's not the one, Erin.

17:49.943 --> 17:50.944
Trust me.

17:51.361 --> 17:52.821
You can do so much better anyway.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.198
[Tommy] Whoo!

17:55.074 --> 17:56.408
Did you guys bring beer?

17:58.035 --> 18:01.955
[Oly] Every stud has specific needs,
and their owners expect us to meet them.

18:02.039 --> 18:04.833
I am not looking for someone to tell me
which corners to cut.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.462
I want a buyer so I can upgrade
my facilities my way.

18:08.837 --> 18:11.548
What I don't need is your opinion
along with it.

18:11.632 --> 18:14.843
Well, we don't know anything
about running a horse farm, so...

18:15.427 --> 18:17.346
our only opinion is that...

18:18.388 --> 18:19.973
you have a very special place here,

18:21.016 --> 18:22.226
and we'd like to invest in it

18:22.309 --> 18:24.269
and then perhaps
with the financial support,

18:24.353 --> 18:26.522
you can turn it into whatever
you've dreamed it could be.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.649
[Marty] You can run the day-to-day,
the, you know,

18:28.732 --> 18:30.818
the hirings, the purchasing, all of it.

18:30.901 --> 18:34.530
-I'd expect nothing less.
-Exactly. So let's just for one minute,

18:34.613 --> 18:38.700
let's forget about all the necessary
upgrades and the owner expectations.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.160
You can do that with anyone's money.

18:40.244 --> 18:43.956
What we wanna know is,
what is your dream for this place?

18:46.250 --> 18:49.253
We overlook the dams. The mothers.

18:50.796 --> 18:53.132
A broodmare can only carry
one foal a year.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.801
A stud can service 100 mares
in that time.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.970
People forget they're both important,

18:58.053 --> 19:00.430
and great dams don't sell too often.

19:01.348 --> 19:04.017
But I've got an idea
about how to fix that.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.687
Have you ever been to a maiden race?

19:07.271 --> 19:09.898
That's the-- Isn't that the--
That's the race with the new horses?

19:09.982 --> 19:12.192
That's right. Horses that haven't won yet.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.278
Now, if you've got an eye for it,

19:14.361 --> 19:18.031
you can spot future winners
coming in around third or fourth place.

19:18.490 --> 19:21.660
I figure if we buy up a bunch of them,
play the numbers.

19:21.743 --> 19:22.744
With our studs,

19:22.828 --> 19:25.038
we stand a chance of putting out
a whole pack of winners.

19:25.539 --> 19:28.125
Maybe even run our own champ
and keep the winnings.

19:28.208 --> 19:31.336
[laughs] There is no greater feeling
than your own horse coming in.

19:32.379 --> 19:33.255
I bet.

19:33.630 --> 19:34.548
Let's do it.

19:35.924 --> 19:37.134
Wanna do it?

19:37.551 --> 19:40.888
We'll, I don't know, tack on
another 6% into the investment

19:40.971 --> 19:43.182
and we'll earmark it for this.
What do you say?

19:43.724 --> 19:45.392
-You in?
-You kidding?

19:45.726 --> 19:47.352
I haven't gotten an offer like it.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.398
-Thank you. Yes.
-[laughs]

19:51.481 --> 19:53.192
Thanks for coming out to the farm today.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.736
It's a long drive.
You're welcome to spend the night.

19:55.819 --> 19:57.863
We have a pretty little guest cottage
all made up.

19:57.946 --> 19:59.531
Oh, thank you, we...

20:00.324 --> 20:02.326
Zeke's hearing is tomorrow afternoon.

20:03.619 --> 20:04.745
We'll get up early.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.121
I'll go with you.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.333
-Really?
-Yeah.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.756
Well, I guess we're staying. [laughs]

20:19.927 --> 20:21.136
So...

20:21.220 --> 20:23.388
you know Ruth, then. From the casino?

20:24.139 --> 20:25.557
I work with her sometimes.

20:26.934 --> 20:27.851
Yeah,

20:27.935 --> 20:30.270
I know her. She's... cool.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.564
I don't really see her though,
'cause I'm in the office.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.566
Oh. I got you.

20:35.525 --> 20:37.945
-You like it? Working for your parents?
-[cell phone vibrates]

20:45.619 --> 20:46.536
What? Um...

20:46.954 --> 20:48.455
Yeah, it's fine. It's a summer job.

20:48.538 --> 20:49.957
So how do you guys know each other?

20:52.125 --> 20:53.961
My mom is their parents' lawyer.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.965
I normally live in Chicago,
but she dragged me here for the summer.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.009
You're Helen Pierce's daughter?

21:01.927 --> 21:04.388
[Erin] Yeah. You've heard of her?

21:06.848 --> 21:08.517
I should really get you back.

21:10.769 --> 21:14.940
My parents are gonna be home any second
and they're pretty strict, so... come on.

21:15.023 --> 21:18.193
Um, can I check out the restroom
before you throw us out?

21:19.903 --> 21:20.946
Fine.

21:28.453 --> 21:30.539
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Taking a piss.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.582
The bathroom's right there.

21:33.917 --> 21:34.960
What can I say?

21:35.043 --> 21:37.421
I wanted to wipe my dick
on your parents' sheets.

21:37.963 --> 21:38.922
We good?

21:39.006 --> 21:41.425
No. Why were you in there?

21:43.051 --> 21:43.927
Listen.

21:44.553 --> 21:45.721
What's going on?

21:46.847 --> 21:49.099
-He was using Mom and Dad's bathroom.
-So?

21:49.182 --> 21:50.767
Don't be weird, Jonah.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.396
I think you need to leave.

21:57.649 --> 21:58.692
I'll text you.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.402
We're going out Saturday, okay?

22:03.572 --> 22:04.531
[chuckles] Cool.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.748
[laughs] We should bring the kids here.

22:13.832 --> 22:14.666
[Marty] Mm-hmm.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.209
They could learn how to ride.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.504
Jonah's been so serious since Buddy.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.257
Since forever.

22:22.591 --> 22:23.884
I was just like that.

22:24.217 --> 22:26.219
Really? No kidding.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.973
-[laughs]
-You know what?

22:30.724 --> 22:32.351
Let's break into the stables.

22:33.769 --> 22:36.938
What-- What, like this? We can't.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.775
Why not? We own the place. Come on.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.165
Look at this guy.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.085
-[neighs]
-Hi.

23:03.173 --> 23:04.216
Hi.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.218
Are you really okay?

23:09.179 --> 23:12.724
This doesn't feel like something
you'd get over in a day.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.854
Well, it was-- it was hell.

23:18.980 --> 23:22.067
I wasn't lying, and I--
I told the kids that, but, um...

23:28.031 --> 23:30.158
Wendy, this might have been the best thing

23:30.534 --> 23:32.035
that could have ever happened.

23:32.911 --> 23:36.206
I spent a decade afraid of something,
and when it finally arrived,

23:36.289 --> 23:38.250
it wasn't at all
what I thought it would be.

23:38.917 --> 23:42.003
And I wasn't who I thought I would be.

23:44.673 --> 23:45.966
What does that mean?

23:46.758 --> 23:48.009
It means you were right.

23:48.844 --> 23:51.346
Me burying my head in the sand
wasn't gonna keep us safe,

23:52.097 --> 23:55.016
but I figured out what is.

23:56.518 --> 23:57.394
What's that?

23:59.020 --> 24:00.897
I'm gonna turn Agent Miller.

24:03.233 --> 24:04.860
I'm gonna put her in our pocket.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.987
That's what I told Navarro.
That's what got me out.

24:09.322 --> 24:12.909
The warrant is gonna expire
in a couple of weeks.

24:12.993 --> 24:15.579
[stammers]
If we just wait it out, she'll be gone.

24:16.329 --> 24:17.789
They're gonna keep coming back.

24:18.206 --> 24:20.959
That's what Maya said, that this
is gonna be a long play for them.

24:21.042 --> 24:22.419
-"Maya"?
-Yeah.

24:22.502 --> 24:24.296
Yeah, that's what she said. Years.

24:24.379 --> 24:27.215
We'll never know when the hammer's
gonna fall, and she's very...

24:27.299 --> 24:29.301
she's very good. [laughs]

24:30.343 --> 24:32.345
I don't know
if I can stay in front of her.

24:32.429 --> 24:34.014
But if we own her...

24:34.973 --> 24:37.642
all the anxiety goes away.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.895
Wendy, if you want safety,

24:40.353 --> 24:43.815
if you want to get the kids out,
this is it.

24:43.899 --> 24:44.858
You hear me?

24:48.403 --> 24:51.573
People...
People don't just turn an FBI agent.

24:52.073 --> 24:53.033
Right.

24:53.116 --> 24:54.618
So why don't we just...

24:55.410 --> 24:57.287
-take a breath...
-What are you doing?

24:57.370 --> 24:58.705
-...be still.
-Don't do that.

24:58.788 --> 25:01.416
You asked me to get involved,
and this is what it looks like.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.668

27:50.251 --> 27:54.130
[sighs] I bet he thought
you looked real smart, too.

27:55.423 --> 27:57.884
Hey, you scrub up all right, Langmore.

27:57.967 --> 28:00.970
With the exception
of this filthy mop you're wearing.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.306
We gotta give that a good wash

28:03.390 --> 28:05.892
if anyone's gonna believe a word
that comes out of your trap.

28:05.975 --> 28:09.396
-I can just tie it back like I always do.
-Oh, don't be a fool.

28:09.813 --> 28:12.357
[babbles]

28:12.440 --> 28:13.274
[laughs]

28:25.495 --> 28:27.372
[Charlotte] <i>She's obsessed with him.</i>

28:27.997 --> 28:31.626
She said that she wanted to lose her
virginity before she went back to school.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.795
Oh, that is tricky.

28:34.671 --> 28:36.965
There's something off about him.

28:37.549 --> 28:41.428
He was asking tons of questions,
and he knows who Helen is.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.304
I'm worried that she's gonna find out.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.181
Well, then-- then lie.

28:45.932 --> 28:49.477
It's okay, if you're protecting her.
She'll find some other...

28:50.145 --> 28:51.438
boy to disappoint her.

28:53.148 --> 28:54.065
Hey.

28:55.525 --> 28:56.568
How do I look?

28:58.027 --> 29:01.281
Like a very responsible citizen. [laughs]

29:03.241 --> 29:05.994
God. It's just so sad, you know?

29:06.077 --> 29:09.497
I mean, she's got no fucking idea
how scary her mom can be.

29:14.419 --> 29:15.587
[Darlene] <i>She is lying.</i>

29:16.004 --> 29:17.839
She wanted to get hit.

29:18.882 --> 29:20.842
She is trying to steal my baby.

29:20.925 --> 29:23.052
Just like how she stole
my late husband's land

29:23.136 --> 29:25.263
for her ugly casino.

29:25.847 --> 29:27.932
Drove him into an early grave.

29:28.850 --> 29:32.729
Not a word comes out
of that woman's mouth can be trusted.

29:32.812 --> 29:34.898
Mrs. Snell, I won't warn you again.

29:34.981 --> 29:37.484
I'm just saying, the way I treat...

29:38.693 --> 29:40.904
that snake of a woman

29:40.987 --> 29:43.490
does not reflect on how I treat Zeke.

29:43.823 --> 29:45.366
Look at my records.

29:46.367 --> 29:48.661
I am doing everything right.

29:48.745 --> 29:50.371
I'm a good mother.

29:51.206 --> 29:53.291
I mean, she told you so.

29:54.209 --> 29:57.629
Mrs. Byrde, do you have anything to add
to your written statement?

29:58.129 --> 29:59.923
Only that I am...

30:00.924 --> 30:02.717
I'm really sorry, Darlene...

30:03.134 --> 30:04.969
I am not trying to hurt you.

30:06.346 --> 30:08.973
We-- We fostered Zeke for a while

30:09.057 --> 30:11.017
after his father left, and...

30:12.227 --> 30:13.520
we love that child.

30:13.603 --> 30:15.814
Our kids love him.

30:15.897 --> 30:17.857
And we can't just look the other way

30:17.941 --> 30:19.776
just because Darlene
is our business partner,

30:19.859 --> 30:21.694
no matter how uncomfortable that may be.

30:21.778 --> 30:24.405
We have to do what's right,
not what's easy.

30:24.823 --> 30:25.990
I'm sorry.

30:30.745 --> 30:31.913
Mrs. Snell...

30:33.623 --> 30:35.124
your records are good,

30:35.208 --> 30:38.127
but it concerns me deeply
that you struck Mrs. Byrde.

30:38.503 --> 30:39.420
I tried to explain--

30:39.504 --> 30:42.549
I think it's time that we heard
from our witness, don't you?

30:48.721 --> 30:49.764
Mr. Langmore.

30:54.143 --> 30:58.898
[clears throat]
Well, Mrs. Byrde was offering to buy Zeke

30:58.982 --> 31:01.442
-for a cut of their new casino.
-[Zeke babbling]

31:01.526 --> 31:02.986
Mrs. Snell didn't want to,

31:03.695 --> 31:06.906
so then Mrs. Byrde called her-- sorry--

31:06.990 --> 31:09.284
uh, a "fucking redneck."

31:09.701 --> 31:11.911
Uh, and then she just swung at her.

31:11.995 --> 31:13.705
It was Mrs. Byrde
who threw the first punch.

31:13.788 --> 31:15.748
Oh, that is a lie! Wyatt!

31:15.832 --> 31:17.208
What are you doing?

31:17.292 --> 31:19.127
[judge] Quiet please, Mrs. Byrde.

31:20.044 --> 31:21.504
Now, go on.

31:21.588 --> 31:25.258
Mrs. Snell was just defending Zeke,
and she was right to.

31:26.426 --> 31:28.803
And if you don't mind me saying, Judge...

31:29.262 --> 31:31.472
Wendy Byrde never has liked us locals.

31:31.931 --> 31:33.683
When they first moved here,

31:34.017 --> 31:36.394
I mean,
she threw a dead possum on my house.

31:37.061 --> 31:38.354
Is this true?

31:39.647 --> 31:41.649
There were unusual circumstances.

31:43.651 --> 31:45.278
And how do you know Mrs. Snell?

31:45.737 --> 31:48.364
I've been doing a little farm work up
at Heron Mills lately.

31:48.781 --> 31:50.950
[judge] And have you observed Mrs. Snell
with the baby?

31:51.075 --> 31:51.993
Yeah.

31:52.493 --> 31:55.622
Yeah, every time I see him,
he's laughing, and...

31:56.581 --> 31:58.333
Darlene loves him like he's her own.

31:58.917 --> 32:02.045
-She's a great mom.
-In his vast experience.

32:02.128 --> 32:03.504
[bangs gavel] Mrs. Byrde.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.052
[chattering]

32:16.142 --> 32:18.728
[softly]
What the fuck is going on at that farm?

32:21.940 --> 32:23.942
[rock music playing]

32:37.622 --> 32:42.126
You want to make $15 the hard way?
[laughs]

32:42.210 --> 32:43.252
Very funny.

33:01.646 --> 33:02.897
Thanks for coming.

33:03.731 --> 33:05.066
I knew you'd call.

33:12.907 --> 33:14.242
-[Ruth clears throat]
-[sighs]

33:15.660 --> 33:18.246
Where does this guy live?
We're going there right now.

33:18.329 --> 33:20.123
-No, you can't.
-Yeah, I can.

33:21.249 --> 33:24.669
Frank Jr. needs a kick in the dick
like nobody I've ever met.

33:25.253 --> 33:27.380
But you can't. I mean it.

33:28.339 --> 33:29.549
He's KC mob.

33:30.425 --> 33:31.759
Shitbag's untouchable.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.594
-Not to me.
-To everyone.

33:34.512 --> 33:35.555
Seriously.

33:38.433 --> 33:40.768
Last time I fucked with him,
it cost Marty big.

33:43.938 --> 33:45.314
What did you do?

33:46.107 --> 33:48.359
I threw him off the top of the boat.

33:50.945 --> 33:52.071
'Course you did.

33:54.574 --> 33:55.408
[shouts]

33:58.036 --> 33:59.245
Motherfucker.

34:06.919 --> 34:10.089
Look at that. It is here.

34:11.549 --> 34:12.383
Huh.

34:15.428 --> 34:16.345
Wow.

34:20.141 --> 34:23.644
-Is this a mistake?
-Uh, no, I ordered it.

34:24.520 --> 34:25.354
When?

34:28.232 --> 34:30.651
Day I got back. They shipped it overnight.
Can you believe it?

34:30.735 --> 34:32.779
I used to play this all the time
when I was a kid.

34:34.113 --> 34:36.991
Fantastic, I'm very--
I'm very happy for you.

34:37.200 --> 34:40.328
But listen, can we get back to Zeke,
please, just for one minute?

34:40.453 --> 34:43.456
You know, I was-- I was so distracted
when you were gone,

34:43.539 --> 34:46.250
-I didn't even think to check in on Wyatt.
-[video game music playing]

34:46.334 --> 34:48.920
We should've gotten to the judge
and should've had our own witness.

34:49.003 --> 34:52.298
-Next time, I'm gonna have everything--
-Whoa, hey, hang on.

34:52.590 --> 34:55.093
There's no next time.
You tried your best, we lost.

34:55.218 --> 34:56.469
It's time to let go.

34:56.677 --> 34:58.304
Okay? We don't need the distraction.

34:59.806 --> 35:01.724
Zeke is not a distraction.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.643
[coin clatters]

35:03.726 --> 35:06.187
You gave him to a sociopath.

35:08.147 --> 35:10.483
We have to get him back.
He's not safe with her.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.694
Well, Lord knows she'll protect him.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.572
And with the way things are,
it's probably for the best.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.326
You don't actually believe that.

35:20.409 --> 35:22.453
-[game beeping]
-Marty.

35:23.329 --> 35:24.372
Marty.

35:38.427 --> 35:40.721
Hi. How'd it go?

35:45.434 --> 35:46.561
We lost.

35:49.647 --> 35:50.773
I'm sorry.

35:53.734 --> 35:54.986
[sighs]

35:57.947 --> 35:58.823
Really?

36:02.034 --> 36:03.452
You gave me the week off.

36:05.037 --> 36:06.747
You drink when we're home.

36:08.374 --> 36:09.542
You're home now.

36:10.376 --> 36:13.045
-[grumbles]
-Fine.

36:16.674 --> 36:17.550
Wait.

36:23.556 --> 36:24.640
Where is Dad?

36:27.852 --> 36:29.896
In the garage playing video games.

36:36.819 --> 36:39.280
Make an appointment for me
to see Jim Rettelsdorf tomorrow.

36:41.115 --> 36:42.658
I'm going up to Kansas City.

36:45.244 --> 36:46.120
Okay.

37:10.019 --> 37:11.354
He's out cold.

37:14.732 --> 37:17.902
I can't thank you enough for today.

37:20.947 --> 37:22.657
Did you mean what you said?

37:24.533 --> 37:25.910
Am I a good mother?

37:26.827 --> 37:27.787
Yeah.

37:28.829 --> 37:30.122
Yeah, every word.

37:30.957 --> 37:33.000
Mmm. He loves you.

37:34.460 --> 37:35.461
[Darlene chuckles]

37:48.516 --> 37:50.184
[Darlene sighs]

38:40.860 --> 38:41.902
That was...

38:42.194 --> 38:43.404
awesome. [chuckles]

38:46.365 --> 38:49.035
I've been around long enough
to know what I'm doing.

38:49.118 --> 38:51.120
[laughing]

39:06.218 --> 39:07.470
What? What you thinking?

39:10.973 --> 39:12.683
Maternity leave is over.

39:14.268 --> 39:16.771
It's time we replanted my fields.

39:28.532 --> 39:29.867
[coin clatters on counter]

39:30.701 --> 39:32.703
[continues filling cup]

39:36.832 --> 39:37.958
You look nice.

39:40.294 --> 39:41.212
Thanks.

39:45.216 --> 39:47.051
Jonah, wanna watch me beat this thing?
Come on.

39:48.135 --> 39:49.929
Are you still playing video games?

39:50.596 --> 39:53.099
Arcade games.
And you told me to rest, so...

39:53.391 --> 39:55.059
-Ready?
-When you own the game,

39:55.184 --> 39:57.812
you don't need quarters.
You can set it to give you infinite lives.

39:57.895 --> 39:58.854
That'd be cheating.

40:03.150 --> 40:04.443
[Ben] You're not wrong.

40:08.155 --> 40:09.073
About what?

40:10.741 --> 40:13.577
That looks like Marty, walks like Marty,
sounds like Marty,

40:13.661 --> 40:15.871
but that is 100% not Marty Byrde.

40:16.956 --> 40:18.290
That guy's vibrating.

40:19.542 --> 40:20.459
He's fine.

40:22.378 --> 40:23.379
Okay.

40:26.882 --> 40:27.967
What is that?

40:28.968 --> 40:30.094
I got a date.

40:39.854 --> 40:40.980
Tommy.

40:42.314 --> 40:43.274
Damn.

40:44.483 --> 40:45.985
You look good in those shorts.

40:48.529 --> 40:50.030
-Hop aboard.
-No.

40:50.114 --> 40:52.616
I came here to tell you
that you can't date Erin.

40:53.325 --> 40:54.243
Really?

41:02.543 --> 41:03.502
Who says?

41:05.921 --> 41:08.632
'Cause I don't really take orders
from teenage girls.

41:11.552 --> 41:13.345
You know who I work for, right?

41:15.639 --> 41:16.557
Yeah.

41:18.350 --> 41:20.311
And you know who my dad is, right?

41:22.646 --> 41:24.648
Him and your boss are kind of tight.

41:25.566 --> 41:27.026
This comes from him.

41:27.651 --> 41:30.362
So cancel your date
and back the fuck off.

41:31.739 --> 41:35.201
Or else Frank Cosgrove finds out
that you crossed Marty Byrde.

41:36.619 --> 41:38.120
I thought we were having fun.

41:38.537 --> 41:39.830
You thought wrong.

41:44.335 --> 41:46.462
I'm afraid this is a waste of your time.

41:47.421 --> 41:49.173
If I was to take an outside client,

41:49.256 --> 41:52.510
it wouldn't be somebody
who almost landed my employer in jail.

41:53.177 --> 41:54.929
Saved from jail.

41:55.513 --> 41:56.805
Agree to differ.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.225
Hmm.

42:00.100 --> 42:01.519
Cut the crap, Jim.

42:01.810 --> 42:03.103
You wouldn't be sitting here

42:03.187 --> 42:05.189
if you didn't know
which way the wind was blowing.

42:06.065 --> 42:07.816
We just bought another casino.

42:07.900 --> 42:09.276
You're stuck with us.

42:09.652 --> 42:11.654
Yes, Big Muddy.

42:11.779 --> 42:16.325
-Well, you caught a lucky break there.
-Ah, not luck.

42:17.159 --> 42:18.035
Judgment.

42:18.494 --> 42:21.121
If that's what you wanna call arson,
very well.

42:23.415 --> 42:27.294
Look, my employer might have a blind spot
when it comes to you, but I don't.

42:27.753 --> 42:30.381
In fact, it's my job to see through it.

42:30.464 --> 42:32.800
I thought your job was
to take care of Charlie's interests.

42:32.883 --> 42:35.177
And let me remind you,
he has a stake in the Missouri Belle,

42:35.261 --> 42:37.263
so that makes our business his business.

42:38.389 --> 42:40.641
You have large ambitions, don't you?

42:42.977 --> 42:43.894
I do.

42:45.229 --> 42:47.273
And we have a very large problem.

42:48.566 --> 42:50.109
Special Agent Maya Miller.

42:50.192 --> 42:53.028
Ah, yes. Your integrated audit.

42:54.822 --> 42:56.782
Well, you should be flattered.

42:56.865 --> 42:59.118
FBI doesn't wheel that out
for just anyone.

42:59.201 --> 43:01.912
[chuckles]
She's their forensic accountant.

43:01.996 --> 43:03.747
We need everything you can get on her.

43:03.831 --> 43:07.710
[laughs] Well, I admire your initiative,

43:07.793 --> 43:11.171
but that would be, how to put it politely,
fucking insane.

43:11.255 --> 43:12.172
Well.

43:12.715 --> 43:15.134
-If you can't do it, I'm sure I can find--
-No, no, no.

43:15.217 --> 43:17.344
Don't simplify things.
It doesn't become you.

43:17.886 --> 43:20.806
I'll get you what you want,
if there is anything.

43:21.390 --> 43:23.017
But just a friendly warning:

43:23.892 --> 43:25.269
Whatever you're planning...

43:26.228 --> 43:28.188
it's a terrible idea.

43:30.608 --> 43:31.734
Noted.

43:33.152 --> 43:35.154
We need it as quickly as you can, please.

43:35.237 --> 43:37.239
I'll call you in a couple of hours.

43:44.163 --> 43:46.665
-[heavy motor whirring]
-[people chattering]

43:50.044 --> 43:51.045
[Darlene sighs]

43:55.132 --> 43:57.134
Four months, we'll be ready to harvest.

43:57.885 --> 43:59.386
Oh, you should see it.

44:00.304 --> 44:02.931
In full bloom,
this whole place is like a miracle.

44:05.517 --> 44:07.770
[whispers] Yeah. Truck.

44:15.653 --> 44:16.612
[Darlene grunts]

44:24.745 --> 44:26.288
[Wyatt] I've never tried heroin.

44:27.331 --> 44:29.583
I thought about it when my dad died.

44:31.043 --> 44:33.128
I even bought some and then threw it out.

44:34.254 --> 44:35.381
Don't say that.

44:36.590 --> 44:38.842
I won't have a junkie in my bed, Wyatt.

44:41.720 --> 44:43.764
I know you got pain. I see it.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.558
But there's pain that uses you,

44:47.351 --> 44:49.103
and there's pain that you use.

44:51.063 --> 44:52.648
You got the good kind.

44:54.108 --> 44:55.359
[kisses]

45:02.116 --> 45:03.075
Come on.

45:06.620 --> 45:07.788
What's going on?

45:08.956 --> 45:10.708
-We've got a problem.
-Yeah?

45:11.750 --> 45:13.794
I met with Jim Rettelsdorf this morning,

45:13.877 --> 45:16.422
and he got us some information
about Agent Miller.

45:17.548 --> 45:18.632
It's not good.

45:20.426 --> 45:22.344
Okay. Why are you involving him?

45:23.011 --> 45:25.305
Because he has a contact at the FBI.

45:25.806 --> 45:26.640
And...

45:27.349 --> 45:29.643
If you're trying to turn an agent,

45:29.727 --> 45:31.854
Maya Miller is the wrong person
to go after.

45:31.937 --> 45:33.021
What did he dig up?

45:33.105 --> 45:34.815
She's a known crusader.

45:34.898 --> 45:39.945
Her father had a mortgage refi business
in Boca Raton.

45:40.028 --> 45:41.905
He scammed a lot of people.

45:41.989 --> 45:45.617
When she was 15, he went to prison,
leaving her mother destitute

45:45.701 --> 45:48.954
along with her little sister
and 100,000 other people.

45:49.037 --> 45:52.416
Taking down people like her father
is her life's work.

45:53.751 --> 45:55.169
She's not gonna turn.

45:55.252 --> 45:56.837
Well, that's disappointing.

45:56.920 --> 45:58.046
Yeah, I don't think so.

45:58.130 --> 46:00.632
I think it's something
we can work with, actually. Um...

46:01.216 --> 46:06.346
Your old firm represented some, uh...
unscrupulous characters.

46:06.430 --> 46:09.224
Uh, there one in there
that you can throw under the bus?

46:09.308 --> 46:11.602
One that fucked over the little guy
and got away with it?

46:12.352 --> 46:13.520
I'd need some evidence.

46:14.229 --> 46:15.522
I'll see what I can do.

46:15.606 --> 46:17.191
What-- What are you gonna do?

46:17.274 --> 46:19.860
I'm gonna throw some chum in the water
and see if she bites.

46:20.360 --> 46:22.446
This is good. Really good.

46:22.529 --> 46:24.948
We should put Rettelsdorf on retainer.

46:30.662 --> 46:31.747
[door shuts]

46:31.914 --> 46:34.082
What the fuck happened to him in Mexico?

46:36.919 --> 46:39.671
Do you think it's a good idea
to turn Agent Miller?

46:39.880 --> 46:42.883
Doesn't matter what I think.
It's what my client expects.

46:50.474 --> 46:53.268
Hey, Maya. Hey. I'll walk with you.

46:53.393 --> 46:54.436
Um...

46:54.853 --> 46:57.856
Just wanted to apologize for yesterday.
That was rude.

46:58.482 --> 47:00.317
Well, you've been through a lot.

47:00.901 --> 47:05.155
Yeah, you know, I sometimes wonder
if I should be in another line of work.

47:05.239 --> 47:06.156
You know?

47:07.449 --> 47:09.368
Yeah, gambling sucks.

47:09.451 --> 47:11.078
You should help people, Marty.

47:11.662 --> 47:13.664
-Beats getting abducted.
-Hmm.

47:14.623 --> 47:16.291
Well, listen,

47:16.625 --> 47:18.919
I know you're just trying to do
the right thing, okay?

47:19.002 --> 47:21.505
Yeah. You should give it a go.

47:22.840 --> 47:25.050
And what's that? Join the war on drugs?

47:25.133 --> 47:27.219
We wouldn't have someone like you
on drug cases.

47:27.302 --> 47:28.846
Anyone can do this.

47:29.137 --> 47:30.597
Somebody with your skills,

47:31.139 --> 47:33.475
I'd make sure
you were doing valuable work.

47:35.644 --> 47:36.645
Such as?

47:37.354 --> 47:38.355
Take your pick.

47:38.730 --> 47:41.608
Bad loans, payday lenders,
corporate tax evasion.

47:42.150 --> 47:44.319
It's not sexy,
but every time we take one down,

47:44.403 --> 47:47.447
it's one step closer to new legislation.
That shit counts.

47:48.156 --> 47:50.534
Is that the kind of work you'd be doing
if you had a choice?

47:51.243 --> 47:52.494
In a heartbeat.

47:54.037 --> 47:56.039
-[Marty] Thank you.
-If you say yes,

47:56.415 --> 47:58.375
and let me off this case.

47:58.584 --> 47:59.543
[Marty] Mm-hmm.

48:03.046 --> 48:05.674
It's something to think about. For sure.

48:12.431 --> 48:13.765
-Thank you.
-No problem.

48:14.516 --> 48:15.475
I'll see you.

48:21.648 --> 48:22.816
[Wendy] <i>I need some help.</i>

48:23.317 --> 48:24.818
What can I do for you?

48:25.944 --> 48:27.070
Last week...

48:28.113 --> 48:30.032
Marty went through something very...

48:30.824 --> 48:31.783
very traumatizing.

48:31.867 --> 48:35.370
It's not my place to...
to give the details,

48:35.454 --> 48:36.747
but I'm concerned.

48:37.414 --> 48:38.498
He's...

48:39.249 --> 48:40.417
He's unpredictable,

48:40.500 --> 48:41.793
he's edgy.

48:42.210 --> 48:44.338
That must be very frightening.

48:44.421 --> 48:45.547
It is...

48:46.340 --> 48:48.467
and especially when I--

48:48.800 --> 48:52.763
I try to convince him that
some of his plans are a little...

48:54.473 --> 48:55.766
They're out there.

48:56.183 --> 48:57.267
I see.

48:57.893 --> 49:01.980
And you want my help to convince him?

49:03.357 --> 49:04.232
Exactly.

49:04.775 --> 49:07.527
And I know your time is very valuable,

49:07.611 --> 49:10.906
but I was thinking
it might be helpful,

49:10.989 --> 49:12.658
in a complicated case like this,

49:12.741 --> 49:15.619
to have some... some extra time...

49:16.370 --> 49:17.287
to think.

49:18.330 --> 49:20.332
Especially in a complicated case
like this.

49:20.415 --> 49:23.460
And I could give you
a supplemental fee,

49:24.044 --> 49:27.381
so you could you could focus
on getting Marty back on track.

49:30.133 --> 49:31.426
Is that something...

49:32.761 --> 49:33.971
that interests you?

49:35.097 --> 49:36.264
Yes.

49:37.641 --> 49:41.269
Yes, I think
it would be very helpful, Wendy.

49:41.353 --> 49:43.063
-Good, great.
-[cell phone ringing]

49:43.146 --> 49:44.106
Oh.

49:45.148 --> 49:46.066
Oh.

49:46.149 --> 49:47.526
Oh, take your call.

49:48.110 --> 49:49.945
Come in a little early next week,

49:50.028 --> 49:52.280
and we can discuss details.

49:52.364 --> 49:53.490
Thank you.

49:56.201 --> 49:57.285
Hi.

49:59.705 --> 50:01.248
What do you mean? Just tell me.

50:02.416 --> 50:05.377
Oh, I'm coming, then. No, I'm coming.

50:05.460 --> 50:08.088
-[dealer] Y'all having fun?
-[indistinct chatter]

50:24.646 --> 50:25.814
What the fuck?

50:45.125 --> 50:46.501
French toast sticks.

50:48.170 --> 50:49.421
Dinner and a show?

50:57.846 --> 50:59.097
I got shit to do.

51:06.646 --> 51:08.023
What the fuck is that?

51:08.857 --> 51:10.650
Fifty pounds of birdseed.

51:19.951 --> 51:23.163
Frank is going to shit when he sees this.

51:24.831 --> 51:26.416
Can't say anyone touched him.

51:35.467 --> 51:37.135
[keycard beeps, door unlocks]

51:39.971 --> 51:43.350
Roger Blinkhorn. Blink Check.
You know him?

51:43.934 --> 51:46.269
Asshole payday lender out of St. Louis.

51:46.353 --> 51:48.146
He raked three million people
over the coals

51:48.230 --> 51:49.815
and got off with a settlement.

51:50.148 --> 51:52.150
We couldn't prove that he knew
what they were doing.

51:53.026 --> 51:55.362
Why do you ask?
You two setting up together?

51:56.238 --> 51:58.031
[printer whirring]

51:59.449 --> 52:01.034
Not after he's in prison.

52:03.870 --> 52:07.624
I got a look at, um, the evidence
that was suppressed.

52:08.291 --> 52:10.919
There's another way to get him. Uh...

52:11.128 --> 52:14.548
Blink Check did a whole lot more
than charge illegal interest rates.

52:14.631 --> 52:17.092
I got a metric shit ton of stuff
on this guy,

52:17.175 --> 52:21.596
and this right here is just two hours
of following the money.

52:22.472 --> 52:27.352
Well, it all started when he created
a holding company back in the '90s--

52:27.435 --> 52:29.896
No, stop. Stop talking.
What the fuck are you doing?

52:31.398 --> 52:33.441
That's the kind of guy
you want to take down, right?

52:33.817 --> 52:35.694
You don't need to tell anyone
how you got there.

52:35.777 --> 52:37.696
You can get a fresh warrant
with what I found--

52:37.779 --> 52:39.739
Marty, hear me when I say this.

52:39.823 --> 52:42.325
You cannot take the deal
without taking the deal.

52:42.617 --> 52:46.580
You can't skip the part where you
sign a confession and go to prison.

52:47.038 --> 52:48.582
That's not how this works.

52:49.166 --> 52:51.751
I'm just trying to show
what I can bring to the table.

52:52.919 --> 52:53.753
No.

52:55.547 --> 53:00.343
I won't let you play cop
and moonlight for a drug cartel.

53:02.971 --> 53:05.223
You gotta prove to me that you're serious.

53:05.849 --> 53:07.267
That starts with you admitting

53:07.350 --> 53:10.061
that Omar Navarro kidnapped you
and took you to Mexico.

53:10.562 --> 53:13.607
Anything less, we're done.

53:15.358 --> 53:18.862
You can rot in prison
and wait for him to kill you.

53:20.572 --> 53:23.783
[door opens, slams shut]

53:33.043 --> 53:34.127
Yeah.

53:41.760 --> 53:43.136
[horse chuffs]

54:02.239 --> 54:04.699
[knock on door]

54:18.463 --> 54:20.340
[gasps]

54:21.758 --> 54:22.634
[gun cocks]

54:27.180 --> 54:30.141
Is it okay if I sit down for this?
My feet are killing me.

54:35.355 --> 54:36.231
Um...

54:39.526 --> 54:42.862
I haven't really been myself
the last few days.

54:44.322 --> 54:45.615
Understandable.

54:46.533 --> 54:47.701
Yeah, but, um...

54:49.452 --> 54:52.998
Still, I should've--
I should've thanked you earlier, um...

54:54.416 --> 54:55.292
right away.

54:55.625 --> 54:56.710
What did I do?

54:57.252 --> 54:58.461
[Marty sighs]

55:00.130 --> 55:01.256
You saved my life.

55:04.843 --> 55:08.722
I know that it was you
that flagged the Panama account.

55:09.139 --> 55:13.727
Only someone that's had their nose in
my business and with your kind of access

55:13.810 --> 55:15.061
could have done that.

55:15.937 --> 55:16.896
So...

55:18.189 --> 55:20.692
I know it was a risky move, but it worked.

55:20.775 --> 55:21.860
Thank you.

55:22.527 --> 55:23.737
You got me out.

55:24.904 --> 55:26.614
Are you saying you were in Mexico?

55:29.242 --> 55:30.535
You've gotta say it.

55:44.507 --> 55:46.217
Last week, I was in Mexico.

55:47.427 --> 55:48.762
With Navarro.

55:51.389 --> 55:52.557
He kidnapped me.

55:59.397 --> 56:01.608
There's nothing wrong
with that horse in there.

56:01.733 --> 56:04.069
Ms. Brennan, you're not listening to me.

56:04.152 --> 56:05.362
The horse is sick.

56:05.445 --> 56:06.780
Just calm down.

56:06.863 --> 56:08.782
How dare you show your face here.

56:09.616 --> 56:12.827
Oly, I don't know anything about this.
I'm just catching up.

56:12.911 --> 56:14.913
Why would you cut off his balls?

56:14.996 --> 56:17.290
And don't tell me it's medical.
She tried that.

56:17.374 --> 56:19.000
We check our horses every day!

56:19.084 --> 56:21.086
That is a perfectly healthy stud in there.

56:21.169 --> 56:23.463
And this is millions of dollars' worth
of damage.

56:23.546 --> 56:25.799
Millions! What am I gonna tell the owner?

56:25.882 --> 56:27.092
We will handle that.

56:27.175 --> 56:28.343
A horse was sick?

56:28.760 --> 56:30.512
The vet will testify to that, yes.

56:30.595 --> 56:33.473
Oh, bullshit! Bull fucking shit!

56:34.015 --> 56:35.517
How could you?

56:35.600 --> 56:38.103
How could you come to my home
and lie like that?

56:38.186 --> 56:39.813
You should be ashamed of yourself.

56:39.896 --> 56:41.231
-You're a monster.
-Oly, I--

56:41.314 --> 56:42.607
You have destroyed me.

56:42.690 --> 56:45.276
You have destroyed everything
I have worked for.

56:45.985 --> 56:49.614
When word gets out about this,
no one will stud their horses here.

56:49.697 --> 56:51.408
We're done. We're finished!

56:51.491 --> 56:53.118
[Helen] Then you better not tell anyone.

56:54.452 --> 56:55.620
Is that understood?

57:01.292 --> 57:03.711
Who the fuck are you people?
[breath shuddering]

57:05.046 --> 57:06.464
Oly, I'm so sorry.

57:09.300 --> 57:10.969
[crying]

57:11.052 --> 57:12.303
Oh, God.

57:12.762 --> 57:13.972
Oh, my God.

57:14.973 --> 57:16.850
Could you take her inside, please?

57:16.933 --> 57:19.102
[stammering] Oly, I'll try and fix this.

57:19.185 --> 57:21.271
-I will.
-[sobbing]

57:24.441 --> 57:25.650
Why would he do this?

57:25.733 --> 57:26.985
He's sending a message.

57:27.068 --> 57:29.362
The horse belongs to Castel Lagunez.

57:30.238 --> 57:32.157
-His rival in the war?
-Mm-hmm.

57:32.240 --> 57:35.410
When he found out that Lagunez' stud
had been moved to Kentucky,

57:35.493 --> 57:37.412
he couldn't pass up the opportunity.

57:38.455 --> 57:39.539
And did you know?

57:40.039 --> 57:43.460
When you sent us out here,
did you know he was gonna do this?

57:43.751 --> 57:45.378
I didn't find out until this morning.

57:45.462 --> 57:48.715
-Believe me, this is not a task I relish.
-Oh.

57:48.798 --> 57:49.841
You're lying.

57:51.718 --> 57:52.844
Give me his number.

57:52.927 --> 57:54.262
-It's not a good idea.
-Hmm.

57:54.345 --> 57:55.763
Give me his fucking number.

57:58.516 --> 58:00.518
[cell phone vibrating]

58:07.567 --> 58:09.444
[Navarro answers in Spanish]

58:09.527 --> 58:12.197
Why didn't you tell me you wanted
to butcher a horse?

58:13.031 --> 58:14.824
How did you get this number, Wendy?

58:14.908 --> 58:18.286
This was supposed
to be a legitimate expansion.

58:18.369 --> 58:20.497
A legitimate business
and you've just ruined it.

58:20.580 --> 58:21.956
The horse is still alive.

58:22.040 --> 58:25.251
I own the farm.
Everything about this is legitimate.

58:25.335 --> 58:27.504
<i>The horse is gravely damaged.</i>

58:27.587 --> 58:29.172
The owner here is devastated.

58:29.255 --> 58:32.217
You've just undermined
everything we've been working on.

58:32.300 --> 58:33.718
We're supposed to be partners.

58:33.801 --> 58:36.513
Partners? No, no, no.
You exist for me to use!

58:37.138 --> 58:38.264
<i>What did you think, huh?</i>

58:38.348 --> 58:41.017
That because you are American,
you are not gonna get your hands dirty?

58:41.100 --> 58:43.478
Wendy, if I am at war, you're at war!

58:44.270 --> 58:45.730
We're not partners.

58:46.147 --> 58:47.273
<i>I own you!</i>

58:48.441 --> 58:52.403
And if you call me again like this,
I will make sure that you remember that.

58:55.281 --> 58:56.783
[call disconnects]

59:01.955 --> 59:04.499
[dialing]

59:05.124 --> 59:07.126
[ringing]

59:08.711 --> 59:09.754
[clicks]

59:13.925 --> 59:15.927
<i>Hi, this is Marty Byrde.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

59:16.010 --> 59:16.886
[beeps]

59:40.994 --> 59:42.620

59:48.668 --> 59:50.378
