Whew, this looks like
a good place to rest.

01:07.902 --> 01:09.334
Ahh...

01:09.336 --> 01:12.371
Whoa! Oof!

01:12.373 --> 01:14.206
I'm okay! Just kind of--

01:14.208 --> 01:15.607
A little-- sort of--

01:15.609 --> 01:16.542
Stuck.

01:16.544 --> 01:17.409
(Giggling)

01:17.411 --> 01:19.178
Oh, Grandpa,
you're so funny.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.780
You look like a
backside-down turtle!

01:21.782 --> 01:23.482
Oh, thanks, Alex.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.551
Maybe you could
give me a hand here.

01:25.553 --> 01:29.621
Sure! Action Scouts
love to help!

01:30.958 --> 01:33.492
Do you need a rest, Alex?

01:33.494 --> 01:35.527
No.
Oh...

01:35.529 --> 01:37.930
Coming right up!

01:38.766 --> 01:40.899
Come on, Grandpa! We found it!

01:40.901 --> 01:44.903
What do you want to do first?
Pitch the tent? Go fishing?

01:44.905 --> 01:48.440
I don't mind
a good, long sit.

01:48.442 --> 01:51.376
Come on! Let's have
an adventure!

01:51.378 --> 01:56.582
You're right, Alex.
Adventure is why we're here.

01:58.385 --> 02:01.587
There we go, the perfect
Action Scout campsite.

02:01.589 --> 02:05.591
Okay, Grandpa, I want to fill in
my Action Badge sash.

02:05.593 --> 02:07.593
What badge should
I earn first?

02:07.595 --> 02:08.694
There's loads of good ones.

02:08.696 --> 02:11.797
Maybe something like
"Outdoor Feasting Badge."

02:11.799 --> 02:14.800
I want to earn the "Fire Safety"
Action Badge.

02:14.802 --> 02:18.003
Okay, but if you're going to
learn about fire safety,

02:18.005 --> 02:21.673
we should learn from the
experts: the PAW Patrol!

02:21.675 --> 02:24.710
Now, where did I pack that cell?

02:24.712 --> 02:27.346
(Snoring)

02:29.550 --> 02:30.949
Aww... he's so cute
when he sleeps.

02:30.951 --> 02:35.420
Shh, don't wake him. The little
pup's all tuckered out.

02:35.422 --> 02:36.555
Guys! Guys!

02:36.557 --> 02:38.390
(Barking)

02:38.392 --> 02:38.790
Shh!

02:38.792 --> 02:41.360
Don't wake up Rubble!

02:41.362 --> 02:44.029
Aww... he's so cute
when he sleeps.

02:44.031 --> 02:47.366
Rocky and I got a whole wagon
load of lemons.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.600
We're gonna make lemonade!

02:48.602 --> 02:50.369
Who's ready to make--

02:50.371 --> 02:51.370
ALL
Shh!

02:51.372 --> 02:54.006
Quieter! You'll wake Rubble.

02:55.843 --> 02:59.578
Aww... he's so cute
when he sleeps.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.979
(Giggling)

03:00.981 --> 03:06.018
Where is that cell phone?
I'm sure I brought it.

03:06.020 --> 03:08.654
Hmm...

03:08.656 --> 03:11.857
There, Grandpa! Found it!

03:11.859 --> 03:12.858
Heh-heh, oh!

03:12.860 --> 03:15.961
Didn't think of
looking back there.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.435
Watch this.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.604
Whoa, cool!

03:25.606 --> 03:27.606
(Phone ringing)

03:27.608 --> 03:29.007
All yours, Zuma.

03:29.009 --> 03:31.510
Go it, Ryder.

03:31.512 --> 03:32.744
Hello?

03:32.746 --> 03:33.545
Mr. Porter!

03:33.547 --> 03:35.647
<i> Ryder! Alex and I need</i>
<i> the PAW Patrol.</i>

03:35.649 --> 03:37.816
<i> Alex needs to get his</i>
<i> Fire Safety Badge--</i>

03:37.818 --> 03:40.485
<i>And come adventure</i>
<i> camping with us!</i>

03:40.487 --> 03:41.320
Fire safety?

03:41.322 --> 03:45.624
The PAW Patrol is always ready
to help keep things safe.

03:45.626 --> 03:46.625
Um, Ryder?

03:46.627 --> 03:47.359
(Giggling)

03:47.361 --> 03:48.894
Be right there, Mr. Porter.

03:48.896 --> 03:53.398
No job is too big,
no pup is too small.

03:54.068 --> 03:56.568
PAW Patrol, to the lookout.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.804
ALL:
Ryder needs us!

03:58.806 --> 04:00.672
Whoa!

04:00.674 --> 04:02.074
Whoa!

04:02.076 --> 04:03.475
BOTH:
Whoa...

04:03.477 --> 04:04.776
Where's Marshall?

04:04.778 --> 04:05.877
And Rubble?

04:05.879 --> 04:07.613
BOTH:
Look out!

04:07.615 --> 04:10.349
When life gives you lemons--

04:10.351 --> 04:11.383
Roll with it!

04:11.385 --> 04:13.085
(Laughing)

04:27.701 --> 04:31.937
PAW Patrol,
ready for action, Ryder, sir.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.005
This is important, Pups.

04:33.007 --> 04:35.741
We're helping Alex get his
Fire Safety Action Badge.

04:35.743 --> 04:41.113
If everyone knew fire safety,
my job would be a lot easier.

04:41.115 --> 04:42.948
Good point, Marshall.

04:42.950 --> 04:46.652
Marshall, we'll need your
fire safety know-how,

04:46.654 --> 04:48.387
and your water cannons.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.555
I'm fired up!

04:50.557 --> 04:52.791
Rubble, we need you
and your digger

04:52.793 --> 04:55.460
to help clear a safe area
around the fire,

04:55.462 --> 04:57.963
and collect sand to
help put the fire out.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.999
Rubble on the double!

05:01.001 --> 05:03.702
All right,
PAW Patrol is on roll!

06:07.835 --> 06:09.968
Yay, they're here!

06:09.970 --> 06:11.870
Thanks for coming, Ryder.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.138
Wouldn't miss it, Alex.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.907
There's always time
for a little fire safety.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.876
Great! What do we do?

06:17.878 --> 06:19.244
First thing about fires is,

06:19.246 --> 06:22.681
never ever make one
unless an adult helps.

06:22.683 --> 06:23.515
That's right.

06:23.517 --> 06:25.684
Okay, let's find a spot
for the fire pit,

06:25.686 --> 06:28.920
away from things
that can catch on fire,

06:28.922 --> 06:30.522
like overhead branches.

06:30.524 --> 06:33.058
Hmm... how about over here,

06:33.060 --> 06:33.959
in this clearing?

06:33.961 --> 06:37.529
Looks perfect, Alex.
Now for the fun part:

06:37.531 --> 06:38.230
making the fire pit.

06:38.232 --> 06:41.767
To stay fire safe, we dig a hole
and line it with rocks

06:41.769 --> 06:45.036
so the wind can't blow the fire
around the forest.

06:45.038 --> 06:48.140
I can dig it! Shovel!

06:55.816 --> 06:59.751
Digging is fun!

06:59.753 --> 07:01.186
Yeah... fun...

07:01.188 --> 07:03.221
Sorry, Mr. Porter.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.256
(Laughing)

07:04.258 --> 07:05.690
What's next, Marshall?

07:05.692 --> 07:07.692
We make a fire break!

07:07.694 --> 07:10.095
But why would you break the fire

07:10.097 --> 07:12.030
when you haven't
even made it yet?

07:12.032 --> 07:13.231
Not that kind of break.

07:13.233 --> 07:16.668
A fire break means we clear
a space around the fire.

07:16.670 --> 07:20.705
So there's nothing too close
that can catch on fire.

07:20.707 --> 07:22.274
Arf! Shovel!

07:26.079 --> 07:26.978
Great job, guys.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.847
Now comes my favourite part.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.183
The part where we have lunch?

07:31.185 --> 07:31.850
Not yet.

07:31.852 --> 07:35.253
You should always have water
ready to put the fire out.

07:35.255 --> 07:37.289
Water cannons!

07:40.227 --> 07:44.062
And if you can't use water,
you can use sand.

07:44.064 --> 07:47.132
ALL:
Sand?

07:47.134 --> 07:50.135
Can we make a fire now?

07:50.137 --> 07:51.603
Marshall?

07:51.605 --> 07:54.139
Good place for a fire: check.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.141
Fire pit dug: check.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.243
Fire break cleared: check.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.145
Sand gathered: check.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.581
Water ready: check.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.750
(Gasping)

08:05.752 --> 08:07.152
We're ready!

08:07.154 --> 08:08.854
(Cheering)

08:08.856 --> 08:10.322
Ryder, do you have the wood?

08:10.324 --> 08:10.989
All set,

08:10.991 --> 08:13.725
with nice, dry, dead wood that
was lying around the campsite.

08:13.727 --> 08:17.329
Okay, then! Mr. Porter,
you can light the fire.

08:17.331 --> 08:20.165
Right-o, Marshall!

08:25.105 --> 08:26.171
Yes, we did it!

08:26.173 --> 08:28.039
That's how you make a safe fire.

08:28.041 --> 08:31.309
Now the most important part:
putting the fire out.

08:31.311 --> 08:31.977
I'm ready.

08:31.979 --> 08:36.381
If a fire ever gets out of
control, call 9-1-1, right away.

08:36.383 --> 08:38.016
But even for a small campfire,

08:38.018 --> 08:40.919
you have to make sure
it's all the way out.

08:40.921 --> 08:43.255
(Barking)

08:47.327 --> 08:51.363
Cool! You can use sand
to help put out a fire!

08:51.365 --> 08:55.667
Yep. Sand and water both
smother small fires.

08:55.669 --> 08:58.703
A good splash of water.

08:58.705 --> 09:02.340
And then stir the coals to make
sure there's no smoke or embers.

09:02.342 --> 09:05.076
Then you'll know for sure
the fire's out.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.344
Did that do it?

09:06.346 --> 09:07.679
(Sniffing)

09:07.681 --> 09:08.213
It sure did!

09:08.215 --> 09:13.318
Alex, I hereby present you
the Fire Safety Action Badge.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.986
Cool!

09:14.988 --> 09:16.421
(Cheering)

09:16.423 --> 09:18.690
That's my Alex.
Great job!

09:18.692 --> 09:20.959
But I believe there was
talk of a... feast?

09:20.961 --> 09:26.264
Oh, boy! My next badge! Can you
stay and eat with us, Ryder?

09:26.266 --> 09:28.233
We'd be happy to.

09:30.704 --> 09:33.138
Chili's ready! Who wants some?

09:33.140 --> 09:35.040
(Excitedly barking)

09:39.379 --> 09:42.781
You know what goes great
with chili?

09:42.783 --> 09:44.416
BOTH:
Liver sausage!

09:44.418 --> 09:47.986
You're in luck, pups.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.421
Mm-mmm!

09:49.423 --> 09:51.122
Have one, Mr. Porter.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.257
Me? No thanks.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.126
Come on, try some, Mr. Porter!

09:55.128 --> 09:56.428
Try it, Grandpa!

09:56.430 --> 09:57.996
(Sniffing)

09:57.998 --> 09:59.397
Oh... oh...

09:59.399 --> 10:00.865
(Whimpering)

10:00.867 --> 10:04.302
Oh, all right...

10:04.304 --> 10:06.905
Oh...

10:06.907 --> 10:08.039
Bleh-- Oh!

10:08.041 --> 10:12.110
Do you like it?
Pretty good, huh, Mr. Porter?

10:12.112 --> 10:15.046
Um... very...

10:15.048 --> 10:15.747
liver-y.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.882
Knew you'd love them!
Have another!

10:17.884 --> 10:22.487
Uh, no. I don't wanna
hog them all, pups.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.290
(Laughing)

10:25.292 --> 10:27.959
Oh, Grandpa, you're so funny.

10:27.961 --> 10:31.396
Where's my camera?

10:32.199 --> 10:33.264
Got it!

10:33.266 --> 10:35.100
(Leave rustling)

10:35.102 --> 10:37.168
A deer!

10:37.170 --> 10:38.837
(Bleating)

10:38.839 --> 10:40.338
Look out!

10:41.174 --> 10:43.174
Look out!

10:44.745 --> 10:48.046
She scattered the fire!

10:48.048 --> 10:49.447
Good thing Rubble
made a fire break.

10:49.449 --> 10:52.217
There's nothing there
to catch on fire.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.786
Alex! Use your
fire safety, quick!

10:54.788 --> 10:56.788
Right! Uh...

10:56.790 --> 10:59.057
Water! Sand!

10:59.793 --> 11:02.794
The sand and water will
put these out easily.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.329
I think we got them all.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.463
(Sniffing)

11:05.465 --> 11:08.199
I smell something...

11:08.201 --> 11:10.935
like... smoke!

11:12.873 --> 11:16.341
I got it!

11:16.343 --> 11:18.510
Rubble on the double!

11:18.512 --> 11:20.478
Arf! Shovel!

11:23.817 --> 11:27.485
Looks... and smells
like it's out!

11:27.487 --> 11:30.388
I better stir the ashes,
to make sure.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.356
Nice job, Alex.

11:31.358 --> 11:35.093
Didn't think I'd be using my
Fire Safety badge already!

11:35.095 --> 11:36.061
Thanks, PAW Patrol.

11:36.063 --> 11:40.398
If you ever need to build a
safe fire, just yelp for help.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.166
Exactly!

11:41.168 --> 11:44.102
What a bunch of good
Action Scouts.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.236
(Laughing)

11:45.238 --> 11:47.238
I get it!

11:55.015 --> 11:57.282
(Clucking)

11:59.386 --> 12:01.119
That table over there.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.421
No, wait, over there.

12:03.423 --> 12:06.558
That box over, um... there.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.327
Ooh, everything's
working perfectly!

12:09.329 --> 12:12.297
We just have to make sure
Ryder and the PAW Patrol

12:12.299 --> 12:13.998
get here on time.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.967
I'll give them a call.

12:15.969 --> 12:19.471
Apples are sweet,
pears are plump.

12:19.473 --> 12:22.907
Who's gonna be the next to jump?

12:22.909 --> 12:26.010
Rocky, Zuma, Marshall, Skye?

12:26.012 --> 12:27.312
Me, me, me!

12:27.314 --> 12:30.949
I have to flip before you try!

12:32.052 --> 12:34.953
(Laughing)

12:34.955 --> 12:37.222
(Phone ringing)

12:40.927 --> 12:41.926
Hi, Mayor Goodway.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.462
<i> Hello, Ryder.</i>
<i> This is your mayor here.</i>

12:44.464 --> 12:46.931
<i> Adventure Bay needs you</i>
<i> and the PAW Patrol</i>

12:46.933 --> 12:48.333
<i> to come to city hall today.</i>

12:48.335 --> 12:50.602
Why? Is there an emergency?

12:50.604 --> 12:53.304
<i> Uh, no, not exactly, but I--</i>

12:53.306 --> 12:54.072
(Phone ringing)

12:54.074 --> 12:57.675
Hang on, Mayor Goodway.
I have another call.

12:57.677 --> 13:00.612
<i> Uh, well, all right, then.</i>
<i> Don't be long!</i>

13:00.614 --> 13:01.346
Hi, Alex.

13:01.348 --> 13:04.149
<i> Ryder, I need the PAW Patrol.</i>

13:04.151 --> 13:04.949
What happened?

13:04.951 --> 13:06.618
<i> Grandpa got stuck in a tree.</i>

13:06.620 --> 13:10.355
<i> Well, part of him got stuck.</i>

13:10.357 --> 13:11.189
<i> Hi, Ryder.</i>

13:11.191 --> 13:14.359
<i> Grandpa got his rump</i>
<i> stuck in the stump.</i>

13:14.361 --> 13:16.494
<i> Hey, Grandpa, that rhymes!</i>

13:16.496 --> 13:18.963
<i> Yes, I suppose it does, Alex.</i>

13:18.965 --> 13:20.532
ALEX:
<i> And there's a skunk!</i>

13:20.534 --> 13:21.199
Uh-oh!

13:21.201 --> 13:22.667
<i>We think he lives in the stump.</i>

13:22.669 --> 13:25.203
<i> Grandpa's afraid we'll get</i>
<i> stunk by the skunk</i>

13:25.205 --> 13:26.971
<i>'cause his rump's in the stump.</i>

13:26.973 --> 13:29.374
<i> Hey, that rhymes twice!</i>

13:29.376 --> 13:31.109
<i> (Grandpa sighing)</i>

13:31.111 --> 13:31.943
(Laughing)

13:31.945 --> 13:35.647
Don't worry, Alex. No job is too
big. No pup is too small.

13:35.649 --> 13:38.349
The PAW Patrol
will answer your call.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.119
ALEX:
<i> Hey, that rhymes too!</i>

13:41.121 --> 13:41.653
(Laughing)

13:41.655 --> 13:44.422
Sorry, Mayor Goodway.
Alex has an emergency.

13:44.424 --> 13:48.092
<i> Oh, uh, of course, Ryder.</i>
<i> I understand.</i>

13:48.094 --> 13:50.495
<i> Good luck!</i>

13:50.497 --> 13:52.997
PAW Patrol to the lookout!

13:52.999 --> 13:56.267
ALL:
Ryder needs us!

13:56.269 --> 13:57.535
(Barking)

13:57.537 --> 14:00.438
Oops. Come on, Skye!

14:00.440 --> 14:03.141
Don't worry. I got your back.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.175
(Laughing)

14:04.177 --> 14:05.677
(Barking)

14:05.679 --> 14:08.079
(Laughing)

14:08.081 --> 14:09.647
Whoa! Oof!

14:09.649 --> 14:10.348
Huh?

14:10.350 --> 14:13.551
And now I got your back,
Marshall.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.621
(Laughing)

14:31.137 --> 14:35.440
PAW Patrol ready for action,
Ryder, sir!

14:35.442 --> 14:36.541
Thanks for racing over, pups.

14:36.543 --> 14:39.711
Mr. Porter sat in a tree stump,
and now he's stuck.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.247
And there's a skunk who
wants his home back.

14:42.249 --> 14:47.418
Once I got sprayed by a skunk,
and it really stunk.

14:47.754 --> 14:50.588
Rocky, I need your truck and
peanut dispenser

14:50.590 --> 14:52.690
to help keep the skunk occupied.

14:52.692 --> 14:56.027
Green means go!

14:56.029 --> 14:58.062
Chase, I need you
to use your winch

14:58.064 --> 15:00.431
to help pull Mr. Porter
out of the stump.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.333
Chase is on the case!

15:02.335 --> 15:06.070
All right, PAW Patrol
is on a roll!

15:06.072 --> 15:07.739

Nice skunk...
Nice skunk...

16:20.680 --> 16:22.280
(Sirens approaching)

16:22.282 --> 16:25.516
Ryder's here!

16:25.518 --> 16:27.552
Uh-oh!

16:27.554 --> 16:29.420
Thanks for coming, Ryder.

16:29.422 --> 16:30.154
No problem.

16:30.156 --> 16:33.791
Rocky, see if you can keep that
skunk busy for a few minutes.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.727
I sure can.

16:35.729 --> 16:38.596
Peanut dispenser!

16:44.704 --> 16:46.838
How will you get me out, Ryder?

16:46.840 --> 16:48.339
(Grunting)

16:48.341 --> 16:49.774
I'm wedged pretty tight.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.309
We'll hook you to Chase's winch,

16:51.311 --> 16:54.746
and he'll give you a pull
and get your, um--

16:54.748 --> 16:55.713
Rump.

16:55.715 --> 16:56.447
(Laughing)

16:56.449 --> 16:58.549
Yeah, get your rump free.

16:58.551 --> 16:59.283
Ready?

16:59.285 --> 17:01.619
Chase is on the case!

17:01.621 --> 17:03.554
Winch!

17:07.460 --> 17:09.460
Okay, Chase, got it!

17:09.462 --> 17:13.297
Oh, no. The skunk's coming back!

17:14.200 --> 17:16.300
Uh-oh. Chase!

17:16.302 --> 17:17.902
On it.

17:17.904 --> 17:19.203
(Barking)

17:19.205 --> 17:20.805
Net!

17:24.210 --> 17:26.477
Sorry, little skunk.

17:26.479 --> 17:29.347
(Barking)

17:32.485 --> 17:34.619
(Grunting)

17:34.621 --> 17:36.354
Ohh!

17:37.357 --> 17:40.758
Are you okay, Grandpa?

17:40.760 --> 17:41.626
I'm free!

17:41.628 --> 17:44.629
Yay! My rump's not stuck
in the stump!

17:44.631 --> 17:46.697
My rump's not
stuck in the stump!

17:46.699 --> 17:49.367
Aw, thanks, Ryder.
Thanks, pups!

17:49.369 --> 17:50.968
Whoa... whoa!

17:51.905 --> 17:54.505
(Hissing)

17:54.507 --> 17:56.240
(Coughing)

17:56.242 --> 17:57.775
Ooh, I stink.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.777
And so does my net.

17:59.779 --> 18:00.745
What should we do?

18:00.747 --> 18:04.415
Well, the only way to
get rid of skunk stink

18:04.417 --> 18:05.316
is a tomato juice bath.

18:05.318 --> 18:08.619
But where can we get a bathtub
fill of tomato juice?

18:08.621 --> 18:09.520
I know!

18:09.522 --> 18:10.388
BOTH:
Whoa!

18:10.390 --> 18:11.456
Stay back, Mr. Porter.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.658
Sorry, but there's a whole
storeroom full

18:13.660 --> 18:14.959
at the restaurant.

18:14.961 --> 18:17.662
Great. I know who to call.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.964
Marshall, we need your help.

18:19.966 --> 18:22.233
<i> I'm fired up!</i>

18:23.269 --> 18:24.936
Now, Marshall!

18:24.938 --> 18:27.705
Tomato juice!

18:30.510 --> 18:33.878
(Spluttering)

18:33.880 --> 18:36.581
Water!

18:39.319 --> 18:41.886
Hand towel.

18:41.888 --> 18:46.424
Yay! Now Grandpa
doesn't stink anymore.

18:46.426 --> 18:47.391
(Laughing)

18:47.393 --> 18:48.960
(Phone ringing)

18:48.962 --> 18:50.294
Hi, Mayor Goodway.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.697
<i> Hi, Ryder!</i>
<i> How's the rescue going?</i>

18:52.699 --> 18:53.731
All done!

18:53.733 --> 18:54.699
(Phone ringing)

18:54.701 --> 18:56.701
Uh-oh, hold on, Mayor.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.569
Hi, Captain Turbot.

18:58.571 --> 18:59.837
<i> Ryder, Wally must be stuck!</i>

18:59.839 --> 19:02.707
<i> He always jumps for a jar full</i>
<i> of jellyfish jam,</i>

19:02.709 --> 19:04.742
<i> but my latest jug</i>
<i> went untouched.</i>

19:04.744 --> 19:06.611
On our way, Captain!

19:06.613 --> 19:08.846
<i> Let me guess,</i>
<i> another emergency?</i>

19:08.848 --> 19:09.747
Sorry, Mayor.

19:09.749 --> 19:12.583
<i> Good luck, Ryder!</i>

19:12.585 --> 19:13.484
(Laughing)

19:13.486 --> 19:16.854
RYDER:
<i> Skye, I need you and your</i>
<i> copter at Turbot's island.</i>

19:16.856 --> 19:18.055
<i> Wally stuck out there.</i>

19:18.057 --> 19:19.690
This puppy's gotta fly!

19:19.692 --> 19:21.859
<i> Zuma, I need you</i>
<i> and your hovercraft</i>

19:21.861 --> 19:24.328
<i> to help tow Wally to safety.</i>

19:24.330 --> 19:26.297
Let's dive in!

19:26.299 --> 19:28.799
(Barking)

19:33.606 --> 19:36.474
Ryder! I see Wally!

19:36.476 --> 19:37.875
He's stuck down in the rocks,

19:37.877 --> 19:39.911
and his tail is
tangled up in a sail.

19:39.913 --> 19:42.747
Okay, Skye, we're almost there.

19:42.749 --> 19:46.384
Ryder, Zuma! Thanks for
coming to the rescue.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.586
Hi, Captain Turbot.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.087
Wally's behind those rocks.

19:50.089 --> 19:52.590
We're on a roll!

19:55.061 --> 19:57.662
(Wally barking)

19:59.532 --> 20:03.568
Don't worry, Wally,
we'll get you out of there.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.772
There you go, big guy.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.774
(Barking)

20:09.776 --> 20:11.442
(Laughing)

20:11.444 --> 20:15.079
Zuma, can you reach Wally
with your buoy?

20:15.081 --> 20:17.081
Buoy!

20:19.052 --> 20:21.953
Nice catch.
Okay, now hold it tight.

20:21.955 --> 20:23.988
Take it slow, Zuma!

20:31.030 --> 20:33.798
A little more...

20:36.536 --> 20:39.470
Whoa, easy there, big guy!

20:43.843 --> 20:45.776
Great work, Zuma!

20:48.648 --> 20:52.083
All right, Wally,
come and get it!

20:53.886 --> 20:55.586
(Barking)

20:55.588 --> 20:56.921
(Laughing)

20:56.923 --> 20:58.656
(Phone ringing)

20:58.658 --> 20:59.624
Hi, Mayor Goodway.

20:59.626 --> 21:00.891
Now we can come to City Hall,

21:00.893 --> 21:02.593
unless another
emergency pops up.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.596
<i> Oh, there's definitely another</i>
<i> emergency, Ryder.</i>

21:05.598 --> 21:06.697
<i> It's Chickaletta.</i>

21:06.699 --> 21:09.700
<i> She's hanging from banner,</i>
<i> and she might fall!</i>

21:09.702 --> 21:11.836
On our way!

21:11.838 --> 21:14.705
(Sirens wailing)

21:14.707 --> 21:17.508
Marshall, get your ladder over
to the clock tower.

21:17.510 --> 21:18.976
I'm fired up.

21:18.978 --> 21:22.079
And Chase, get your net ready,
in case Chickaletta falls.

21:22.081 --> 21:23.848
Chase is on the case.

21:23.850 --> 21:27.151
The PAW Patrol is
coming to save you!

21:27.153 --> 21:29.620
Ladder!

21:30.857 --> 21:34.659
Don't worry, Chickaletta.
I'm on my way.

21:36.596 --> 21:38.696
Uh-oh.

21:38.698 --> 21:39.597
Oh, dear!

21:39.599 --> 21:41.599
Chase, your net.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.601
Net!

21:52.745 --> 21:54.445
(Clucking)

21:54.847 --> 21:57.748
Chickaletta, thank goodness
you're safe!

21:57.750 --> 21:58.783
Oh, Ryder, thank you!

21:58.785 --> 22:02.787
No problem. Whenever you're in
trouble, just yelp for help!

22:02.789 --> 22:07.224
But, uh, why did you need us all
here in the first place?

22:07.226 --> 22:08.759
For this!

22:08.761 --> 22:11.228
I declare today officially

22:11.230 --> 22:14.665
PAW Patrol Appreciation Day!

22:14.667 --> 22:16.634
ALL:
Surprise!

22:16.636 --> 22:20.871
Pup-pup, hooray!
Pup-pup, hooray!

22:20.873 --> 22:21.539
But why?

22:21.541 --> 22:23.641
Because you saved Grandpa!

22:23.643 --> 22:24.642
And Wally!

22:24.644 --> 22:26.243
And don't forget Chickaletta!

22:26.245 --> 22:28.946
That's three saves
in just one day!

22:28.948 --> 22:33.184
You see? Everyone thinks you're
all such good pups.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.920
(Laughing and cheering)

22:35.922 --> 22:37.788
Jellyfish jam, anyone?

22:37.790 --> 22:38.489
Ew, yuck.

22:38.491 --> 22:41.992
All right, more for me
and Wally!

22:43.763 --> 22:46.230
Okay, then, just Wally.

22:46.232 --> 22:48.766
