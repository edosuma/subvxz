00:01.566 --> 00:03.046
Previously on
"Time After Time"...

00:03.090 --> 00:04.613
Hello, Brooke.
It's me.

00:04.656 --> 00:05.918
John brought something
back from the island --

00:05.962 --> 00:09.139
some serum my father made
with John's DNA.

00:09.183 --> 00:11.141
Your body's still processing
the serum.

00:11.185 --> 00:12.490
What did you give me?

00:12.534 --> 00:14.144
I don't know how,
but it healed me,

00:14.188 --> 00:15.754
and I don't trust
Brooke with it.

00:15.798 --> 00:17.756
We have to stop her,
Vanessa.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.410
Griffin?

00:19.454 --> 00:21.673
You believe she plans
to sell the serum?
Absolutely.

00:21.717 --> 00:23.153
Vanessa, we cannot let her
do that.

00:23.197 --> 00:25.286
Promise me you will get
my journal off this island.

00:25.329 --> 00:26.939
You're the one
who gives it to Brooke.

00:26.983 --> 00:29.072
I am begging you,
please, don't do this.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.334
I helped you.

00:30.378 --> 00:33.120
Yes, you did.
But he left me to die.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.340
H.G.! H.G.!

00:36.384 --> 00:37.602
Is that true?

00:37.646 --> 00:39.300
He lied to your face.

00:39.343 --> 00:40.779
How can you ever trust him
again?

00:40.823 --> 00:43.260
All this craziness,
it's too much.

00:43.304 --> 00:45.175
It's time for me
to go home.

00:45.219 --> 00:46.437
Goodbye, H.G.

00:47.830 --> 00:50.963
♪♪

01:04.977 --> 01:07.241
Adam?
Who's at the door?

01:13.247 --> 01:15.640
Griffin?

01:15.684 --> 01:17.120
What did you do to me?

01:17.164 --> 01:19.296
You're going through
withdrawal.

01:19.340 --> 01:21.081
Make it stop.

01:24.388 --> 01:26.129
Take him down to the lab.

01:28.871 --> 01:31.134
Achilles' heel returns.

01:31.178 --> 01:32.918
He's my brother.

01:32.962 --> 01:34.311
He tried to kill you --

01:34.355 --> 01:35.443
and vice versa.

01:35.486 --> 01:37.358
I can't keep score.

01:48.369 --> 01:50.197
Can you make it stop?

01:53.243 --> 01:54.766
I can give you
a maintenance dose

01:54.810 --> 01:56.464
that'll help reduce
the symptoms.

01:57.900 --> 02:00.207
The question is,
why should I?

02:02.644 --> 02:04.341
Because we're family.

02:07.823 --> 02:10.391
Damn it, Griffin.

02:12.393 --> 02:14.656
You need to rest. We'll see
how you feel in a few hours.

02:14.699 --> 02:16.571
Okay.

02:32.804 --> 02:34.632
Are you going to
help him?

02:34.676 --> 02:37.592
Maybe. I want to monitor
his symptoms first.

02:40.595 --> 02:42.074
It's Griffin.

02:46.949 --> 02:48.037
I'm in.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.691
Did she suspect
anything?

02:49.734 --> 02:52.911
She doesn't trust me,
but she didn't turn me away.

02:52.955 --> 02:55.175
How are you feeling?

02:55.218 --> 02:59.570
Mmph. I've been better.
Didn't have to exaggerate much.

02:59.614 --> 03:01.224
Hang in there.

03:01.268 --> 03:04.096
You have to find the serum --
all of it -- and destroy it.

03:04.140 --> 03:05.576
It's too dangerous.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.404
I understand.

03:07.448 --> 03:09.406
I have to go now.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.495
I'll call when I can.

03:13.976 --> 03:17.501
If you help him,
he'll only betray you again.

03:19.634 --> 03:21.679
What do you suggest I do?

03:22.854 --> 03:24.943
He is my brother,
and he's in pain.

03:24.987 --> 03:26.249
Kill him.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.685
That'll stop the pain.

03:28.991 --> 03:31.080
I'll even do it for you.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.433
Watch him. If he gets any worse,
you let me know.

03:39.784 --> 03:43.527
And if he tries anything,

03:43.571 --> 03:45.616
then kill him.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.161
So, we're moving the moon rocks
to Gallery 3

04:09.205 --> 04:10.685
to make room
for the space shuttle.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.034
Okay.

04:12.077 --> 04:13.818
It's good to see you.
It's been forever.

04:13.862 --> 04:15.342
It's been two weeks.

04:15.385 --> 04:18.301
A phone call would've been
nice -- a text -- anything.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.172
You practically
disappeared.

04:20.216 --> 04:22.827
I'm sorry, Leon.
I must've gotten carried away.

04:22.871 --> 04:25.003
Into the glamorous world
of Vanessa Anders,

04:25.047 --> 04:26.483
or with your actor
boyfriend?

04:26.527 --> 04:27.832
A little of both.

04:27.876 --> 04:29.486
I knew it was that guy.

04:29.530 --> 04:30.835
It's always a guy.

04:30.879 --> 04:32.315
Well, that's over now.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.317
Things got
a little too intense,

04:34.361 --> 04:36.145
but let's not talk
about that.

04:36.188 --> 04:39.496
I've been a really bad friend,
and I'm really sorry.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.671
Will you forgive me?

04:40.715 --> 04:42.325
We've all been there.

04:42.369 --> 04:43.718
I'm just glad you're back.

04:43.761 --> 04:45.285
Me too.

04:45.328 --> 04:47.591
I forgot how exciting
moon rocks can be.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.289
Right?

04:53.771 --> 04:55.599
I'll be right back.

04:58.210 --> 05:01.170
Okay, Carl, what are
you doing here?

05:02.214 --> 05:04.434
I was instructed
to keep an eye on you.

05:11.659 --> 05:13.530
How are you feeling?

05:13.574 --> 05:15.358
Like my skin is on fire.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.360
This injection should help
stabilize you.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.362
What is it?

05:19.406 --> 05:21.538
The serum --
just a small dose.

05:21.582 --> 05:23.845
Just enough to help you
with withdrawal symptoms.

05:23.888 --> 05:25.325
Mmph.

05:28.240 --> 05:30.199
Has that Richard Knox fellow
arrived?

05:30.242 --> 05:31.722
Richard Knox?

05:31.766 --> 05:33.724
Richard Knox,
the venture capitalist?

05:33.768 --> 05:35.378
What are you doing
with him?

05:35.422 --> 05:36.597
Don't worry about it.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.250
Oh, didn't she
tell you?

05:38.294 --> 05:41.863
Your sister has big plans
for my magic DNA.

05:41.906 --> 05:44.866
She's going to sell me
to the highest bidder.

05:44.909 --> 05:46.911
Is that true?
You're selling the serum?

05:46.955 --> 05:49.174
We don't have
Vanessa Anders' money.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.135
Don't we deserve to salvage
something from all this?

05:53.178 --> 05:55.833
Yes, Griffin, if I'm going to
be stuck in this time,

05:55.877 --> 05:57.705
I'm going to do it
as a rich man.

05:57.748 --> 05:59.184
What do you care
about money?

05:59.228 --> 06:01.273
Enough.
You need to rest.

06:01.317 --> 06:03.232
You should feel better
in a few hours.

06:03.275 --> 06:04.973
I'll tell you
all about it then.

06:27.343 --> 06:28.605
May I help you?

06:30.651 --> 06:33.131
H.G.,
what are you doing here?

06:33.175 --> 06:36.134
I know that you called Vanessa
about Carl.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.138
Don't blame her.
It was my idea.

06:40.182 --> 06:42.314
I needed to know
that you were safe.

06:42.358 --> 06:44.055
John is still out there.

06:44.099 --> 06:46.144
I can handle myself
just fine.

06:46.188 --> 06:48.364
Selfishly, it was
for my own peace of mind.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.975
And you had to come here
and tell me this in person?

06:51.019 --> 06:53.413
Another selfish move
on my behalf.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.503
How are you?

06:58.374 --> 07:01.333
Jane, I hate how
we left things.

07:01.377 --> 07:03.161
It's time for my break.

07:03.205 --> 07:05.120
Why don't we go outside?

07:08.732 --> 07:11.300
As you can see, the patient
has become septic.

07:11.343 --> 07:13.345
He has a high fever,
some swelling,

07:13.389 --> 07:15.347
and even some mental
deterioration.

07:15.391 --> 07:17.654
He volunteered for this?

07:17.698 --> 07:19.743
He let himself contract
a fatal disease?

07:19.787 --> 07:21.005
Who does this?

07:21.049 --> 07:22.485
A brave individual

07:22.529 --> 07:24.879
helping push the boundaries
of science, Mr. Knox.

07:24.922 --> 07:26.489
And well-paid, I trust.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.242
And just like that,

07:40.285 --> 07:42.592
I've eradicated a disease
once considered deadly.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.681
For the fourth time,
I might add.

07:47.641 --> 07:49.512
Remarkable.

07:49.556 --> 07:52.036
How are you manipulating
the DNA?

07:52.080 --> 07:54.169
It's an offshoot
of my father's work

07:54.212 --> 07:55.997
combined
with my own research.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.868
This is
my father's journal.

07:57.912 --> 08:00.262
He left me his findings.

08:02.264 --> 08:05.354
Your father's work with
the DoD back in the '80s.

08:05.397 --> 08:09.880
It was shut down
before it was realized.

08:09.924 --> 08:12.274
Now Brooke and I
have been continuing it.

08:13.928 --> 08:15.320
No side effects
of note?

08:17.540 --> 08:19.890
Perhaps two
worth mentioning.

08:21.588 --> 08:24.939
Number one, the serum enhances
the subject's strength

08:24.982 --> 08:27.245
approximately 600%.

08:27.289 --> 08:32.294
And two,
it's highly addictive.

08:32.337 --> 08:34.209
You've created
a Superman.

08:34.252 --> 08:36.559
We prefer to call them
"super soldiers."

08:36.603 --> 08:39.431
You think there's a military
application for the drug?

08:39.475 --> 08:41.390
During wartime,
you're gonna want these guys

08:41.433 --> 08:42.652
on the front lines.

08:42.696 --> 08:44.306
Each has the strength
of six men,

08:44.349 --> 08:46.569
significantly reducing
the number of soldiers

08:46.613 --> 08:48.310
needed on the ground.

08:48.353 --> 08:53.097
They're resistant to disease
and chemical weapons, and...

08:53.141 --> 08:55.360
they're easy to control.

08:56.623 --> 08:59.277
All we need is the funding
to perfect it.

08:59.321 --> 09:01.279
Who else
knows about this?

09:01.323 --> 09:03.281
Just you,

09:03.325 --> 09:05.457
as of right now.

09:05.501 --> 09:07.590
And you didn't want to
take this

09:07.634 --> 09:09.592
to the Department
of Defense?

09:11.333 --> 09:14.684
I've learned
from my father's mistakes.

09:14.728 --> 09:16.251
Mm.

09:16.294 --> 09:17.774
I take it your test trials

09:17.818 --> 09:19.820
wouldn't survive
an ethics board.

09:19.863 --> 09:22.997
Richard, that's why
we called on you.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.913
I know that discretion
is where you thrive.

09:27.001 --> 09:30.395
I want to move on this right
away, before word gets out.

09:30.439 --> 09:33.094
I can set up a meeting tonight
of investors.

09:33.137 --> 09:34.443
Are you prepared
for that?

09:34.486 --> 09:38.708
Sure.
Just tell us where and when.

09:40.057 --> 09:41.885
And you name again?

09:41.929 --> 09:46.194
Stevenson --
Dr.Stevenson.

09:46.237 --> 09:52.722
Well, doctors, let me make
a few phone calls.

09:59.424 --> 10:03.515
I know I shouldn't
have come, but I just...

10:03.559 --> 10:05.953
wanted to know
how you're doing.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.391
I'm good.

10:11.436 --> 10:13.482
I've really missed you.

10:15.136 --> 10:17.007
I missed you, too, but...

10:17.051 --> 10:18.792
what more can we do?

10:18.835 --> 10:21.664
I mean, think about it.
What's gonna happen to us?

10:21.708 --> 10:24.232
No matter how
you write this story,

10:24.275 --> 10:26.974
it always ends with you
returning to 1893,

10:27.017 --> 10:28.192
where you belong.

10:28.236 --> 10:29.846
You have to write
your books.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.543
You have to live
your life,

10:31.587 --> 10:33.633
and I should just get on
with mine.

10:36.026 --> 10:38.376
It's the only ending for us.

10:40.117 --> 10:41.858
It's for the best.

10:41.902 --> 10:43.686
I suppose so.

10:44.992 --> 10:47.342
I should get back to work.

10:52.347 --> 10:54.436
Goodbye, H.G.

11:05.273 --> 11:07.797
Ooh.
Oh, I am so sorry.
God.

11:07.841 --> 11:09.712
Thank you.
I should've been looking.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.409
I'm so--

11:12.889 --> 11:14.412
Get him in.

11:14.456 --> 11:16.023
No!

11:16.066 --> 11:17.502
They took him!

11:20.331 --> 11:21.811
Hurry!

11:31.560 --> 11:34.258
Who are you?
What is the meaning of this?

11:34.302 --> 11:36.086
I'm sure you're really
confused right now,

11:36.130 --> 11:37.914
but I'm gonna ask the questions,
if you don't mind.

11:37.958 --> 11:40.395
Well, I do mind, actually.

11:40.438 --> 11:41.962
Where am I?

11:42.005 --> 11:44.268
Someplace private, so we can
talk without interruptions.

11:44.312 --> 11:46.053
Let's start
with your name.

11:46.096 --> 11:48.229
I have nothing to tell you.

11:48.272 --> 11:52.363
Well, my name is
Agent Danielle Forbes,

11:52.407 --> 11:55.758
and I work for the United States
Department of Defense.

11:55.802 --> 11:58.195
Now, let's start with, how'd
you get to New York City,

11:58.239 --> 12:00.763
how long have you been here,
and what are you doing here?

12:00.807 --> 12:02.722
None of which
is your business.
Wrong.

12:02.765 --> 12:05.594
My job is to protect this
country from dangerous people.

12:05.637 --> 12:08.292
Why do you believe
that I'm dangerous?

12:09.729 --> 12:12.079
Guys, thanks for helping out
with this,

12:12.122 --> 12:14.081
but I think I need
to question him alone.

12:14.124 --> 12:16.039
I'll meet you
back at the field office.

12:28.530 --> 12:30.662
They're from
the New York division.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.970
They're not aware
of why I'm really here.

12:34.014 --> 12:35.667
Which is...?

12:35.711 --> 12:39.802
I'm from D.C., and while
I do work for the D.O.D.,

12:39.846 --> 12:41.891
I'm an astrophysicist.

12:41.935 --> 12:44.502
While I wish I knew
what that was --How disappointing.

12:44.546 --> 12:47.375
I was hoping I wouldn't have to
explain that to H.G. Wells.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.596
Well, that was easy.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.685
I don't know what
you're talking about.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.600
Don't insult me,
Mr. Wells.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.994
I've put a lot on the line
coming here.

12:58.038 --> 13:00.605
Let's stop playing games.
What do you say?

13:01.868 --> 13:03.826
Try to sit up.
Yeah.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.617
I feel a little better.
Thank you.

13:13.705 --> 13:14.881
It's only temporary.

13:14.924 --> 13:16.796
The serum has proved
extremely addictive.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.623
I'll try to wean you
off of it slowly.

13:18.667 --> 13:19.842
Let's go!

13:19.886 --> 13:22.540
Be back
in a few hours.

13:22.584 --> 13:25.326
So, how much money do you think
this serum will fetch?

13:25.369 --> 13:26.893
Enough for all of us.

13:26.936 --> 13:29.591
Knox is known
for his overseas tales.

13:29.634 --> 13:34.378
You don't care if the serum
goes to Russia or North Korea?

13:34.422 --> 13:36.293
They have deeper pockets.

13:36.337 --> 13:39.209
True.
This could be huge.

13:39.253 --> 13:40.907
John, congratulations,

13:40.950 --> 13:44.388
you really are adapting well
to modern times.

13:44.432 --> 13:45.912
We need to get going.

13:45.955 --> 13:47.783
Please see my brother
back to his room.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.220
You mean my cell?

13:50.264 --> 13:51.874
You don't have to
lock me up, Brooke.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.789
Yes, she does.

13:57.662 --> 13:59.360
So, you refuse to admit it.

13:59.403 --> 14:02.493
Why would I admit
to something so preposterous?

14:02.537 --> 14:05.235
As an astrophysicist
with the DoD,

14:05.279 --> 14:08.021
it is my job to track
unexplained anomalies.

14:08.064 --> 14:10.110
Recently, my department
picked up

14:10.153 --> 14:12.416
on a large energy source
in New York.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.897
It had a geographical signature
we've never seen before

14:14.941 --> 14:17.900
with a structure that seemed
to pierce both space and time.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.902
It sort of reminded me
of a black hole.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.556
Does any of this
sound familiar?

14:21.599 --> 14:23.645
It sounds ridiculous.

14:23.688 --> 14:25.908
Perhaps you should recalibrate
your instruments.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.779
That's what
my colleagues said.

14:27.823 --> 14:30.086
Well, perhaps you should
listen to them.

14:30.130 --> 14:32.175
I did, and I got
the same results.

14:33.176 --> 14:36.571
So I developed software
that mapped the fluctuations.

14:36.614 --> 14:38.312
Multiple signatures
across Manhattan,

14:38.355 --> 14:40.444
another on an island
on the coast of Maine,

14:40.488 --> 14:42.838
and one more in London.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.232
I started to figure out
the pattern --

14:45.275 --> 14:47.582
the strength
of the energy signature

14:47.625 --> 14:49.889
tells me how long ago
it was formed.

14:49.932 --> 14:53.153
Based on the active rate
of energy decay, I dated them.

14:53.196 --> 14:55.807
Manhattan is 2017,

14:55.851 --> 14:57.766
Maine is 1980,

14:57.809 --> 15:00.203
and London is 1893.

15:00.247 --> 15:04.033
Do you know who lived
in London in 1893?

15:04.077 --> 15:05.948
Many people.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.646
Including H.G. Wells,

15:08.690 --> 15:11.519
but I'm sure that's
just a coincidence.

15:15.523 --> 15:18.961
I believe that these anomalies
pose a danger to space and time.

15:19.005 --> 15:23.400
I need to understand
what's going on.

15:56.346 --> 15:58.348
They're all gone.Okay.

15:58.392 --> 16:00.307
I've deactivated
her security system.

16:00.350 --> 16:03.005
Great. Watch the door.
Let us know if anyone shows up.

16:03.049 --> 16:05.094
Griffin, this is Cameron.
He's a cyber specialist.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.704
How you doing?He's on my payroll.

16:06.748 --> 16:08.358
Where's H.G.?He ran into some trouble.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.012
Carl's on his way
to get him right now.

16:10.056 --> 16:12.797
Okay. The lab is downstairs.
We should hurry.

16:14.408 --> 16:17.019
The only thing that's gonna get
you out of this is the truth.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.239
I demand that you untie me.
I have to be somewhere.

16:19.282 --> 16:20.805
Where?
What's going on?

16:20.849 --> 16:22.242
Tell me
and I might let you go.

16:22.285 --> 16:23.939
There's no time.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.159
This would've been a lot easier
if you had just trusted me.

16:27.421 --> 16:30.119
Draw your gun slowly...

16:30.163 --> 16:32.730
and put it on the ground.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.210
Jane?

16:34.254 --> 16:36.038
Jane, you shouldn't
be here.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.475
I'm a Federal Agent.
You're making a big mistake.

16:38.519 --> 16:41.043
Since when do Federal Agents
kidnap citizens?

16:41.087 --> 16:43.002
This is official
government business.

16:43.045 --> 16:46.527
Really? Because this all
looks really shady to me.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.327
Untie him.

17:13.423 --> 17:15.382
Let's get out of here.

17:30.136 --> 17:31.485
How long is this
gonna take you?

17:31.528 --> 17:33.139
Depends on how sophisticated
her security is.

17:33.182 --> 17:34.357
I'll know in a bit.

17:51.505 --> 17:52.810
Is that the serum?

17:52.854 --> 17:54.073
Yes.

17:58.338 --> 17:59.861
Are you okay?

18:01.950 --> 18:05.084
I will be.
Let's just get rid of it.

18:07.434 --> 18:09.610
Are there any other computer
terminals in the house?

18:09.653 --> 18:11.481
Brooke's research
is on her laptop.

18:11.525 --> 18:13.179
You'll need
to wipe that, too.

18:14.441 --> 18:15.833
I don't see it.

18:18.836 --> 18:20.316
She must've taken it
with her.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.318
Damn it.

18:22.362 --> 18:24.581
We need that laptop.

18:30.283 --> 18:33.416
♪♪

18:44.384 --> 18:46.037
How did
you know I was here?

18:46.081 --> 18:48.692
Carl and I followed you.
Who was that woman?

18:48.736 --> 18:50.955
She was a DoD agent.
She knows who I am.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.131
The government knows?

18:52.174 --> 18:54.133
It's Vanessa.

18:55.221 --> 18:56.222
Vanessa?

18:56.265 --> 18:57.788
Brooke is on her way
to a meeting

18:57.832 --> 18:59.529
with a venture capitalist
named Richard Knox.

18:59.573 --> 19:01.401
He's the investor
we've been looking for.

19:01.444 --> 19:03.272
All right,
what do I do now?

19:03.316 --> 19:05.883
Brooke took her laptop with her to the meeting with Knox.

19:05.927 --> 19:07.146
We're destroying
everything at the lab,

19:07.189 --> 19:08.582
but we need her laptop

19:08.625 --> 19:10.323
because it contains
all her research.

19:10.366 --> 19:12.151
Where is this meeting
taking place?

19:12.194 --> 19:13.891
I'll text you
the address.

19:13.935 --> 19:16.198
Now, I have a way
we can remotely destroy

19:16.242 --> 19:17.460
everything
on her computer.

19:17.504 --> 19:18.766
And how do I do that?

19:18.809 --> 19:21.029
I'll put Cameron on now.

19:21.072 --> 19:22.335
I've created an app

19:22.378 --> 19:23.945
that can remotely delete
Brooke's laptop,

19:23.988 --> 19:26.165
but I need you
to download it to your phone.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.992
I'll send it to your phone,
Jane.

19:28.036 --> 19:29.907
What do we do
after it's downloaded?

19:29.951 --> 19:31.561
If you can get close enough
to Brooke's laptop,

19:31.605 --> 19:33.302
I can do the rest
on my end.

19:33.346 --> 19:34.999
I'm texting you
the address now.

19:35.043 --> 19:36.523
Be careful.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.568
Why does John care about
Project Utopia?

19:38.612 --> 19:39.743
He was against it.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.484
Or he needed
to control it.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.660
John has always been
about power and prestige.

19:43.704 --> 19:47.577
He wasn't just a doctor in 1893.
He was the chief surgeon.

19:47.621 --> 19:49.840
You don't have to do this.

19:51.102 --> 19:52.234
I know.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.629
It's not far.
Let's go.

19:55.672 --> 19:56.804
Okay.

20:16.171 --> 20:17.781
William, I want you
to stay in the lobby

20:17.825 --> 20:19.696
and make sure we don't
have any interruptions.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.089
Yes, Ma'am.

20:26.399 --> 20:27.356
Dr. Monroe.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.705
Mr. Knox.

20:28.749 --> 20:30.272
Dr. Stevenson.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.754
I have assembled some
very excited investors.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.756
And we are very excited
to meet them.

20:35.799 --> 20:37.148
And I hope you're ready.

20:37.192 --> 20:39.542
There's only one shot
with these people.

20:39.586 --> 20:40.891
We're more than ready.

20:40.935 --> 20:43.459
Your confidence
is inspiring.

20:43.503 --> 20:45.374
Follow me.

20:54.035 --> 20:55.819
How do we know
this is everything?

20:55.863 --> 20:57.256
I know my sister.

20:57.299 --> 20:59.475
She keeps everything
contained in one place.

21:00.824 --> 21:02.783
I have to find
my father's journal.

21:02.826 --> 21:04.611
I saw it earlier.

21:04.654 --> 21:06.743
It has to be down here
somewhere.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.274
What?

21:17.014 --> 21:18.755
Thank you.

21:20.061 --> 21:22.019
I've ruined my life,
Vanessa.

21:22.063 --> 21:24.674
It's over for me, but it doesn't
have to be over for you.

21:24.718 --> 21:26.197
It's not over for you,
Griffin.

21:26.241 --> 21:28.243
Everything I wanted --

21:28.287 --> 21:32.378
my career,
a life with you...

21:33.814 --> 21:35.816
...there's no coming back
from this.

21:39.907 --> 21:41.343
How do we get inside?

21:41.387 --> 21:43.345
There must be
another entrance.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.565
Carl, if you go that way,
I'll go around back.

21:45.608 --> 21:47.393
I'm coming with you.

22:03.713 --> 22:05.324
This way.

22:11.025 --> 22:12.418
The staircase.

22:12.461 --> 22:14.811
Knox's office
is on the fourth floor.

23:00.770 --> 23:02.119
Don't move.

23:03.817 --> 23:05.471
Stop!

23:12.260 --> 23:13.783
-Jane, you all right?
-Yeah.

23:16.569 --> 23:18.397
Did you follow us?

23:18.440 --> 23:20.442
Yes.

23:22.009 --> 23:23.880
Now, care to explain
what's going on?

23:33.324 --> 23:34.891
It took five shots
to stop that man.

23:34.935 --> 23:37.024
Somebody better start
explaining this real quick.

23:39.766 --> 23:41.637
You were right about me.

23:41.681 --> 23:45.032
I am H.G. Wells,
and I traveled here from 1893.

23:45.075 --> 23:47.643
And my time machine and I have
made an absolute mess of things,

23:47.687 --> 23:48.818
and we're trying to fix it.

23:48.862 --> 23:50.254
1980 --
the island in Maine --

23:50.298 --> 23:52.039
do you know what happened
on that island?

23:52.082 --> 23:54.389
Yes, I do. It was a DoD
research program --

23:54.433 --> 23:55.521
genetic engineering.

23:55.564 --> 23:57.261
Yes, but it went
horribly wrong.

23:57.305 --> 23:59.568
And a deadly drug was
brought back to this time,

23:59.612 --> 24:00.743
and we have to stop it.

24:01.701 --> 24:02.919
How do we do that?

24:02.963 --> 24:04.399
By stopping
the people who have it.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.749
They're on the fourth floor
of this building.

24:08.577 --> 24:10.187
Well, then, let's do it.

24:17.847 --> 24:20.502
Ladies and gentlemen,

24:20.546 --> 24:23.505
we live in uncertain times --

24:23.549 --> 24:25.681
ISIS, global terrorism,

24:25.725 --> 24:29.032
even our own country
is divided against itself.

24:29.076 --> 24:30.947
The world has become
a powder keg,

24:30.991 --> 24:33.036
and some days it seems
like the match

24:33.080 --> 24:36.039
could come from anywhere
at nay second.

24:36.083 --> 24:37.606
It's no longer a question of if

24:37.650 --> 24:39.695
there's going to be
another world war,

24:39.739 --> 24:41.523
but when,
and how bad it will be.

24:41.567 --> 24:44.787
It's in our nature
to tear each other apart.

24:44.831 --> 24:46.615
So now, more than ever,

24:46.659 --> 24:49.618
safety is important,
strength is important.

24:49.662 --> 24:53.100
We have better guns,
bigger bombs, chemical weapons,

24:53.143 --> 24:55.494
but they're not making us
any safer.

24:55.537 --> 24:58.018
In fact, they're making
our soldiers

24:58.061 --> 24:59.889
more vulnerable than ever.

24:59.933 --> 25:01.804
Warfare has evolved.

25:01.848 --> 25:05.068
Our world has evolved...

25:05.112 --> 25:07.418
but...

25:07.462 --> 25:11.727
human beings have not --
until now.

25:11.771 --> 25:14.513
Humanity is about to take
its next step forward.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.645
This is Project Utopia.

25:16.689 --> 25:20.083
Human enhancement --
it's no longer just a theory.

25:20.127 --> 25:21.737
See for yourselves.

25:46.414 --> 25:49.417
Increased strength --
the strength of six men.

25:49.460 --> 25:51.854
Enhanced endurance and stamina.

25:51.898 --> 25:56.598
Immunity to most known bacteria
and viral infections.

25:56.642 --> 25:59.122
Rapid healing.

26:05.128 --> 26:06.521
This way.

26:08.392 --> 26:11.047
Tonight I am offering
you the opportunity...

26:15.617 --> 26:18.533
And now it just needs to log on
to Brooke's computer.

26:20.274 --> 26:22.885
The strength of six men?
Please.

26:22.929 --> 26:25.627
I've been involved with
enhancement therapy for years.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.629
This defies
all current findings.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.500
You're correct. It does.

26:29.544 --> 26:30.937
What I'm saying,
Dr. Monroe, is,

26:30.980 --> 26:32.895
this sounds a lot
like your father talking.

26:32.939 --> 26:35.245
And we know how
his work went nowhere.

26:36.333 --> 26:38.509
Perhaps a demonstration
is in order.

26:40.555 --> 26:44.777
Adam, a simple handshake
for Mr. Stillman.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.608
Go ahead,
shake his hand.

26:57.659 --> 27:00.183
Stop! Stop!Okay.

27:00.227 --> 27:02.533
You're breaking it.Adam, relax. Let him go.

27:02.577 --> 27:03.665
Aah.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.711
I think the point
has been made.

27:05.754 --> 27:08.539
This is not a trick.
Project Utopia is real.

27:08.583 --> 27:11.630
Now, the serum does have
its side effects.

27:11.673 --> 27:14.415
But with the right program
of maintenance doses,

27:14.458 --> 27:15.938
we can use those effects

27:15.982 --> 27:18.637
to make the subjects
subservient.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.856
Take Adam, for instance.

27:20.900 --> 27:23.250
Would anyone care to see
what else he can do?

27:23.293 --> 27:25.382
Any requests?

27:25.426 --> 27:27.297
Is it working?

27:27.341 --> 27:29.038
I installed the virus
on her laptop,

27:29.082 --> 27:31.388
but it's still too far away
to initiate the wipe.

27:31.432 --> 27:32.868
Well, how close
does it need to be?

27:32.912 --> 27:34.653
I don't know.

27:36.916 --> 27:38.395
Jane.

27:42.617 --> 27:46.403
Imagine soldiers who can
withstand firearms

27:46.447 --> 27:48.579
and biochemical weapons,

27:48.623 --> 27:50.320
who don't need to rest
or recover,

27:50.364 --> 27:54.324
who don't experience
concussion or death.

27:54.368 --> 27:56.326
Now, the serum...

27:59.895 --> 28:03.682
...will experience fear
or doubt.

28:04.900 --> 28:09.339
This is all part of the package
that I can offer you.

28:14.257 --> 28:17.826
Now, shall we talk about
your investment?

28:23.353 --> 28:24.615
Brooke.

28:27.140 --> 28:28.750
Is there something wrong?

28:28.794 --> 28:31.013
I'm not sure.

28:31.057 --> 28:33.624
What the devil is going on?

28:38.368 --> 28:39.718
No.

28:39.761 --> 28:41.502
No, they're wiping it.

28:41.545 --> 28:44.505
♪♪

28:52.426 --> 28:53.906
What the hell is this?

28:53.949 --> 28:55.734
It must be Wells.
He must be in the building.

28:55.777 --> 28:56.952
What are you
talking about?

28:56.996 --> 28:58.519
You have
a security breach.

28:58.562 --> 29:00.216
They're trying to steal
my research right now.

29:06.701 --> 29:08.616
We got to go.

29:12.228 --> 29:13.969
No. They're in the --
they're in the lab, as well.

29:14.013 --> 29:15.275
They'll destroy everything.

29:15.318 --> 29:16.580
Look, I'll have to
get back to you

29:16.624 --> 29:17.712
when I figure out
what's going on.

29:17.756 --> 29:18.669
We have to get
to the lab.

29:18.713 --> 29:20.541
Where are you going, John?

29:20.584 --> 29:22.238
John?

29:24.197 --> 29:26.025
Come on, hurry.

29:26.068 --> 29:27.809
Where's Jane?I don't know.

29:27.853 --> 29:30.290
Hurry up!
Hey, over there!

30:32.613 --> 30:34.876
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.878
Where's your friend?

30:36.922 --> 30:38.488
I don't know.

30:40.186 --> 30:41.578
Oh, God.

30:41.622 --> 30:43.885
You all right?

30:43.929 --> 30:45.278
I'm fine.

30:45.321 --> 30:46.975
Go find her.

30:47.019 --> 30:49.282
Are you sure?

30:50.457 --> 30:51.980
I'll be back.

31:00.728 --> 31:02.861
What are you doing here?

31:10.564 --> 31:12.087
You seem frightened.

31:12.131 --> 31:13.610
You've cornered me.

31:13.654 --> 31:15.090
What do you expect?

31:15.134 --> 31:18.267
Oh. Well, an explanation
would be nice.

31:18.311 --> 31:22.271
After everything he did to you,
after he lied to you...

31:22.315 --> 31:25.013
...how can you still trust him?

31:26.623 --> 31:28.277
Don't do this.

31:28.321 --> 31:29.626
Where is he?

31:29.670 --> 31:32.064
This is not about H.G.
or me.

31:32.107 --> 31:33.587
This is about the serum.

31:33.630 --> 31:35.284
You need to stop.

31:35.328 --> 31:37.112
I know you're mad at me.

31:37.156 --> 31:38.244
"Mad"?

31:38.287 --> 31:39.810
No, I'm -- I'm not mad.

31:39.854 --> 31:42.291
I'm gonna tear you apart.

31:58.133 --> 31:59.482
Are you okay?

31:59.526 --> 32:01.049
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Are you all right?

32:01.093 --> 32:02.964
Did he hurt you?I'm fine.
He didn't get to me.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.226
We have to warn Vanessa.

32:04.270 --> 32:05.749
Right.

32:09.231 --> 32:10.972
Were you able to wipe
Brooke's laptop?

32:11.016 --> 32:12.800
Yes, but you have to get
out of the townhouse.

32:12.843 --> 32:13.801
Brooke is
on her way over.

32:13.844 --> 32:15.107
We're leaving now.

32:15.150 --> 32:16.630
Are we good here?All finished.

32:16.673 --> 32:18.937
Good. Let's go.

32:19.894 --> 32:21.809
We have to leave.
They're on their way back.

32:21.852 --> 32:22.984
I can't find the journal.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.377
Where else could it be?

32:24.420 --> 32:26.509
I'll keep looking.
You go. Get out of here.

32:30.731 --> 32:32.341
I'll be
right behind you.

32:32.385 --> 32:33.995
No. I'll help.

32:34.039 --> 32:35.692
You should go.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.347
Griffin.

32:48.923 --> 32:51.056
Go.

32:51.099 --> 32:53.841
Go.
Get out of here.

33:00.108 --> 33:02.284
Oh, God,
she's really bleeding.

33:02.328 --> 33:04.983
Take her somewhere safe.
I'm going after Brooke.

33:05.026 --> 33:06.897
I'll make sure
she gets help.

33:24.698 --> 33:26.700
Brooke.

33:26.743 --> 33:29.398
I should've just let you die
the first time.

33:29.442 --> 33:32.010
Where's the journal?

33:32.053 --> 33:34.577
I don't know.

33:34.621 --> 33:36.449
Liar.

33:37.493 --> 33:39.191
It's the only thing
you have left.

33:40.670 --> 33:44.544
It's the only reason
you came back.

33:44.587 --> 33:47.677
What are you gonna do,
burn the place down?

33:48.635 --> 33:50.419
Fitting, isn't it?

33:53.466 --> 33:54.815
Wait.

33:56.121 --> 33:58.601
Okay, you win.

34:31.852 --> 34:33.593
Goodbye, Griffin.

34:34.985 --> 34:36.639
Get out of my way.

34:36.683 --> 34:37.945
No.

34:37.988 --> 34:40.513
Utopia doesn't exist, Wells.

34:44.952 --> 34:47.563
It never did,
and it never will.

34:54.179 --> 34:55.832
Wells, get the journal!

35:00.794 --> 35:02.143
No!

35:02.187 --> 35:03.318
Don't!

35:03.362 --> 35:04.580
No!

35:08.106 --> 35:09.846
No, no, no, no!

35:09.890 --> 35:10.847
No!

35:14.373 --> 35:16.070
No. No.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.898
No, no, no.

35:29.605 --> 35:30.998
Wells, go!

35:31.041 --> 35:33.087
Now!

35:39.398 --> 35:42.052
I'm so sorry, Vanessa.

35:43.837 --> 35:45.969
Griffin died
to destroy the serum.

35:46.013 --> 35:48.537
Yes.
Project Utopia is no more.

35:51.584 --> 35:53.629
And Brooke and John?

35:56.110 --> 35:58.025
They're still out there.

35:58.068 --> 36:00.201
But we will find them.

36:02.638 --> 36:04.684
I want this
to be over.

36:06.381 --> 36:08.905
It's time
for this to be over.

36:08.949 --> 36:10.994
Yes.

36:13.127 --> 36:14.824
The three-alarm fire

36:14.868 --> 36:17.087
ripped through this townhouse
behind me earlier tonight,

36:17.131 --> 36:19.742
spreading rapidly and
threatening nearby residences.

36:19.786 --> 36:22.745
So far, we can confirm that
Griffin Monroe died in the fire.

36:22.789 --> 36:25.270
Mr. Monroe was running for
the 28th District's Senate spot

36:25.313 --> 36:27.010
and was widely considered
a shoo-in,

36:27.054 --> 36:29.404
but saw a steady drop
in polls in recent months.

36:29.448 --> 36:30.753
His campaign office de--

36:36.324 --> 36:38.413
Let me help you with that.

36:43.288 --> 36:45.420
You know
this isn't over.

36:45.464 --> 36:47.857
We can recreate
the serum.

36:50.730 --> 36:52.949
You can't be serious?

36:52.993 --> 36:55.648
All we need is your blood
and your DNA.

36:55.691 --> 36:57.911
Everything else
can be replicated.

36:57.954 --> 37:00.827
Don't sell me a dog.

37:01.784 --> 37:04.178
John, this is...

37:04.222 --> 37:06.006
This is just a setback.

37:06.049 --> 37:07.877
No, no, no, no, no.

37:12.534 --> 37:14.667
This is over.

37:14.710 --> 37:16.451
I'm not a rich woman.

37:16.495 --> 37:17.887
I don't care.

37:17.931 --> 37:20.150
There are plenty of other ways
to make money.

37:20.194 --> 37:23.415
And I'm not playing
your little games anymore.

37:23.458 --> 37:25.286
Your way failed,

37:25.330 --> 37:27.114
so now
we do things my way --

37:27.157 --> 37:29.116
and we start
by destroying Wells.

37:29.159 --> 37:30.770
Do you understand?

37:32.337 --> 37:33.816
Do you understand?!

37:33.860 --> 37:36.341
Yes. Yes, of course.

37:37.864 --> 37:41.259
Then we're clear.
Project Utopia is over.

37:42.564 --> 37:44.392
Yeah. It's over.

37:45.654 --> 37:47.003
Good.

37:49.397 --> 37:51.834
It's unbelievable.

37:51.878 --> 37:54.663
I'm putting my trust in you,
showing you this,

37:54.707 --> 37:55.969
telling you the truth.

37:56.012 --> 37:57.971
Who would I tell?

37:58.014 --> 38:00.495
Who would believe me?

38:00.539 --> 38:02.149
The DoD cut my budget

38:02.192 --> 38:04.586
because they thought my theories
were a waste of time.

38:04.630 --> 38:07.197
You're not tempted to run back,
try and prove your theories?

38:07.241 --> 38:10.418
The DoD would not know what
to do with this information.

38:10.462 --> 38:11.854
How's your wound?

38:11.898 --> 38:13.682
I'll live.

38:13.726 --> 38:16.206
So, aren't you worried?

38:16.250 --> 38:18.034
About what?

38:19.601 --> 38:22.561
You destroyed Project Utopia
and restored the time line,

38:22.604 --> 38:23.953
but what about next time?

38:23.997 --> 38:26.216
As long as the time machine
exists,

38:26.260 --> 38:28.915
don't you risk
doing this again, or worse?

38:28.958 --> 38:31.352
Yes. There's a matter
of unfinished business.

38:31.396 --> 38:33.659
I have to stop John.

38:34.790 --> 38:37.010
I'll help you stop him.

38:38.881 --> 38:40.579
Forgive my suspicions,

38:40.622 --> 38:43.669
but...why would you help me?

38:43.712 --> 38:47.368
There are some of us out there
who believe in your Utopia.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.414
Good does exist
in this world.

38:49.457 --> 38:51.633
Mm. One doubts.

38:51.677 --> 38:53.635
One shouldn't.

39:22.708 --> 39:24.492
So predictable.

39:28.409 --> 39:30.106
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

39:32.108 --> 39:33.414
Save your breath.

39:33.458 --> 39:34.894
Please.

39:39.333 --> 39:41.204
You tried to sedate me

39:41.248 --> 39:43.424
and take my blood
without my permission.

39:43.468 --> 39:45.992
I thought you
were smarter than that.

39:46.035 --> 39:47.820
What will you do?

39:47.863 --> 39:50.170
Oh, don't you worry
about that.

39:50.213 --> 39:52.433
Just go to sleep.

39:52.477 --> 39:55.175
When I wake...

39:55.218 --> 39:59.092
Darling,
you won't be waking up.

40:14.368 --> 40:16.326
Vanessa's upstairs.

40:16.370 --> 40:18.459
Oh, yes.

40:23.377 --> 40:24.857
Thank you
for helping me today.

40:24.900 --> 40:26.685
I know how difficult
it was for you.

40:28.861 --> 40:30.166
Jane, I never meant
for you

40:30.210 --> 40:31.777
to be surrounded
by so much danger.

40:31.820 --> 40:33.474
I know.

40:33.518 --> 40:35.650
And I know I said
I didn't want to be

40:35.694 --> 40:38.174
a part of all
of this, but...

40:38.218 --> 40:39.785
I can't help but think

40:39.828 --> 40:42.701
that maybe I was wrong
for walking away.

40:42.744 --> 40:45.486
Maybe I'm supposed to
be here.

40:45.530 --> 40:48.489
Surrounded by death
and destruction?

40:48.533 --> 40:52.841
To help you stop all this death
and destruction.

40:52.885 --> 40:55.714
It's a question
of destiny.

40:57.063 --> 40:59.021
There's only one real way
we'll know

40:59.065 --> 41:01.546
my purpose in all of this...

41:01.589 --> 41:04.374
and that's to stay.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.466
And when it's all over?

41:10.468 --> 41:13.035
You'll leave,

41:13.079 --> 41:16.038
and it'll break
my heart...

41:17.300 --> 41:20.739
...but I'll pick up the pieces
and move on...

41:20.782 --> 41:23.524
and so will you.

41:23.568 --> 41:26.092
Whether we want to or not?

41:26.135 --> 41:29.965
Yes, whether we want to
or not.

41:34.535 --> 41:35.971
Hello?

41:36.015 --> 41:37.799
Good evening.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.020
John?

41:41.063 --> 41:43.675
Oh, if it isn't
Romeo himself,

41:43.718 --> 41:47.243
back together again with
his Juliet -- how romantic.

41:47.287 --> 41:48.549
Is Brooke with you?

41:48.593 --> 41:50.420
In a sense.

41:50.464 --> 41:53.902
I don't think you have to worry
about Project Utopia anymore.

41:53.946 --> 41:55.077
You killed her?

41:55.121 --> 41:56.557
And you're next, H.G.

41:56.601 --> 42:00.082
One last chat,
you and me, old friend.

42:01.257 --> 42:03.390
I'm coming for you,

42:03.433 --> 42:05.827
and soon,
this will all be over.
