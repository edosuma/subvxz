a secret all these years?

to protect you, too.

to you, it was driving you.

26:33.450 --> 26:35.088
I never regretted it.

Because it did exactly
what I thought it would do.

35:13.210 --> 35:14.404
Can you prove any of this?

35:14.440 --> 35:17.671
You go check out the trunk
of that car yourself.

35:18.510 --> 35:20.273
Agent Ressler...

35:21.450 --> 35:23.714
There has been an allegation
made against you

35:23.750 --> 35:26.412
and your brother by the man
we have in the other room.

35:26.450 --> 35:27.644
Yeah, we were
expecting that.

35:27.690 --> 35:29.214
It's a very serious
allegation.

35:34.600 --> 35:35.919
The thing about
this case is...

35:35.960 --> 35:37.928

35:40.330 --> 35:42.389
* Don't let the darkness
eat you up *

Well, this is
interesting...

35:47.340 --> 35:49.103
ROBBY: How is the body
just gone?

35:49.140 --> 35:51.074
I mean, Markin didn'tjust
get up and walk away.

35:53.510 --> 35:55.319
I think we're good.

35:55.350 --> 35:57.079
I mean, I don't know
exactly what happened,

35:57.120 --> 35:58.348
but I do have
some theories.

35:59.390 --> 36:01.278
I think someone was watching
over us, Robby.

36:02.460 --> 36:03.916
(SIGHS)

36:04.660 --> 36:06.628
Now what do we do?

36:06.660 --> 36:07.979
Well, I think we can
finally put this behind us

36:08.030 --> 36:09.099
and move on.

36:09.130 --> 36:11.621
(SIGHS)
I need a drink.

Oh, hi, sweetie.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.437
Were you boys out
all night?

36:20.470 --> 36:21.505
Yeah, it was a...

36:22.010 --> 36:23.170
It was a long one.

36:24.580 --> 36:26.343
Well, did everything
work out Okay?

36:26.380 --> 36:27.449
What do you mean?

36:27.480 --> 36:30.176
Did you get Robby
out of the trouble he was in?

36:31.750 --> 36:33.240
I knew something was up.

36:33.290 --> 36:34.552
A mother knows.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.856
You here all of a sudden
on a "case."

36:38.890 --> 36:42.155
The case turned out
as well as pOSSIble.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.259
I'm pretty sure
Robby's gonna be Okay.

36:44.300 --> 36:45.562
Thank you, Donnie.

36:45.600 --> 36:48.535
Trouble or not,
your brother means well.

36:48.570 --> 36:51.334
He just gets himself
a bit lost sometimes.

36:51.370 --> 36:53.463
(SCOFFS)
I meant what I said
about your father

36:53.510 --> 36:54.977
being proud
of the both of you.

36:55.010 --> 36:56.409
You know why?

36:57.410 --> 36:59.071
Because you stick together.

ROBBY:
I couldn't do it.

37:58.610 --> 38:00.965
I couldn't just stand in front
of those people and say...

38:04.850 --> 38:05.976
What could I say?

38:07.410 --> 38:08.411
It's Okay.

38:09.580 --> 38:10.740
We got through it.

Tomorrow will be easier,

38:13.450 --> 38:14.883
and the day after that...

Maybe you can do better
with this than I did.

This is Dad's?

38:25.000 --> 38:26.160
I can't be a cop.

38:28.270 --> 38:29.498
I'm nothing like him.

I don't know
what I am anymore.

Yeah. Yeah.

I'm sure the office
has missed me by now.

Yeah.

39:10.180 --> 39:11.875
I'll call.
As often as I can.

I have something for you.

39:24.390 --> 39:25.618
Never thought
I'd see that again.

I think it's your turn
to hang onto it a while.

39:33.100 --> 39:35.330
You don't think
Dad would've wanted the cop
in the family to have it?

39:35.370 --> 39:38.237
No, no.
I think he'd want you
to have it.

Bad time?

No. No, come in.

39:55.660 --> 39:56.888
Did you do it
to protect me?

39:58.560 --> 40:00.050
You say that
like it's a bad thing.

40:01.190 --> 40:02.555
I'm not gonna ask you
how you did it.

40:02.600 --> 40:05.819
I won't ask what you did
with Markin's body or... Or...

40:05.870 --> 40:07.667
Or how you even
scrubbed that car clean,
but...

40:07.700 --> 40:09.463
I learned from the best.

40:09.500 --> 40:11.161

I mean...

Why?

You risked everything.

40:21.050 --> 40:22.472
I mean, if you...
You'd have been caught...

40:22.520 --> 40:24.408
Yeah, but I wasn't.
Yeah, but you could've been.

40:25.790 --> 40:27.018
'Cause if that's
what you're doing,

40:27.050 --> 40:28.187
you're doing
a terrible job of it.

40:28.220 --> 40:29.551
I... I...

40:29.590 --> 40:31.729
I never would've
asked you to take such
a huge risk for me.

40:31.760 --> 40:33.819
You didn't ask.
Yeah, but you
did it anyway.

40:33.860 --> 40:35.748
It wasn't for you,
knucklehead.

40:35.800 --> 40:36.926
It was for me.

40:37.800 --> 40:39.097
For you?

Look, if you wanna
ruin your life

a lifetime ago,

40:42.470 --> 40:44.131
when you were a teenager,
for God's sake,

40:44.170 --> 40:45.899
then someday, sure,
I'll let you.

40:46.740 --> 40:47.900
You'll let me.

40:47.940 --> 40:49.908
Yeah, you have my permission
to be a total dipstick.

40:49.940 --> 40:52.249

So, what am I?

40:52.280 --> 40:53.770
A dipstick
or a knucklehead?

40:53.810 --> 40:55.619
You're a knucklehead
and a dipstick,

40:55.650 --> 40:57.743
and you're someone
that I rely on,

40:57.780 --> 40:59.645
for, like, everything.

41:00.420 --> 41:01.910
We both know
that's not true.

and a Single mom.

to murder my mother,

41:21.940 --> 41:25.671

lethal Russian spy

41:26.950 --> 41:28.406

without even telling me
who She was.

41:32.520 --> 41:34.317
Have you looked at my life?

41:34.350 --> 41:36.318
I mean, really taken
a close look.

41:38.290 --> 41:41.020
Because it's like
I'm in the middle of a monsoon

41:41.060 --> 41:44.928
that's constantly threatening
to drown me in bad news.

41:46.330 --> 41:49.458

of that FEMA disaster

swept out to sea.

gonna happen...
