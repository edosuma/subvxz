WEBVTT

00:00.436 --> 00:02.548
Thor: I'm a neurosurgeon... a scientist.

00:02.684 --> 00:03.668
I was trained to believe

00:03.718 --> 00:06.730
that the idea of a human soul is a joke,

00:07.095 --> 00:12.566
as was any talk of so-called
"near-death experiences."

00:12.633 --> 00:14.268
But then...

00:16.438 --> 00:18.205
I died.

00:19.674 --> 00:22.543
I was a 6 out of 15
on the Glasgow Coma Scale

00:22.577 --> 00:24.878
when the ambulance
brought me to the hospital.

00:24.946 --> 00:29.049
And I hung between life and
death for the next five days.

00:29.083 --> 00:31.317
In layman's terms, I was brain-dead.

00:31.385 --> 00:33.486
And yet...

00:33.554 --> 00:35.889
I still had consciousness...

00:35.957 --> 00:39.492
incredible visions, vivid memories.

00:39.560 --> 00:43.563
I watched, from outside my body,

00:43.630 --> 00:47.066
as the surgeons removed a tumor
from my frontal lobe.

00:47.134 --> 00:49.969
And, no, I didn't offer them any
advice on how to do it better.

00:50.036 --> 00:51.137
- [laughter]
- Ha ha.

00:51.205 --> 00:52.805
But can you imagine it, though?

00:52.872 --> 00:57.076
Looking on as your own body
is lying on the operating table?

01:04.016 --> 01:05.382
You okay?

01:05.450 --> 01:07.086
- Yeah.
- I'm sure the skeptics among you

01:07.153 --> 01:09.488
will dismiss this as pure fantasy.

01:09.555 --> 01:10.656
Because it <i>is.</i>

01:10.724 --> 01:12.725
What? You don't believe he saw heaven?

01:12.792 --> 01:15.227
Yeah. But it was full
of hot, young residents.

01:15.294 --> 01:17.662
This guy hit on everyone here
during his fellowship year...

01:17.696 --> 01:19.231
- everyone.
- Shh.

01:19.298 --> 01:21.933
Thor: In extended consciousness,
but I was immersed in it,

01:22.001 --> 01:26.304
and I cannot repress or deny what I saw

01:26.339 --> 01:27.939
on the other side of life.

01:29.498 --> 01:30.251
Why'd you page me?

01:30.347 --> 01:31.962
I thought Goran had the call
for ortho today.

01:32.042 --> 01:33.564
He booked off. I just need you to pinch-hit.

01:33.614 --> 01:35.507
- Is he sick?
- Didn't say.

01:36.437 --> 01:39.117
Hello, Mr. Crompton. I'm Dr. Harris.

01:39.184 --> 01:40.451
What seems to be the, uh...

01:40.485 --> 01:41.686
Wow! That's a...

01:41.754 --> 01:43.388
nasty piece of work. What happened?

01:43.456 --> 01:44.658
A dog bit me, man.

01:44.726 --> 01:47.006
I fell down two flights
of stairs doing my route,

01:47.218 --> 01:49.041
being chased by this crazy labradoodle.

01:49.110 --> 01:51.053
Why do dog owners
swear their dogs are friendly?

01:51.141 --> 01:52.772
Uh, probably because
the owners <i>aren't.</i>

01:52.964 --> 01:54.231
I'm gonna get you into imaging

01:54.266 --> 01:55.699
and see if you broke any bones, okay?

01:55.767 --> 01:57.134
All right. Thanks.

01:57.202 --> 01:58.269
Damn dog.

01:58.303 --> 01:59.158
[sighs]

01:59.218 --> 02:00.672
Zach, my O.R. is completely booked up.

02:00.757 --> 02:02.263
I cannot be running down here for dog bites.

02:02.351 --> 02:03.850
Page Goran. Tell him we're slammed.

02:03.934 --> 02:05.909
Jackson, how many times have I paged Goran?

02:05.943 --> 02:07.010
At least a dozen.

02:07.045 --> 02:08.344
He's gone completely AWOL.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.174
Hey, did you get a chance

02:09.274 --> 02:11.548
to go listen to your old pal Thor MacLeod?

02:11.582 --> 02:14.701
No, I watched him hit on
my not-so-loving ex-wife for a year.

02:14.751 --> 02:16.619
I doubt almost dying has improved him.

02:16.654 --> 02:17.788
Ah, it worked for <i>you.</i>

02:17.822 --> 02:19.289
Did it?

02:24.027 --> 02:25.728
[thermometer beeps]

02:25.762 --> 02:27.730
I think you have walking pneumonia, Mac.

02:27.764 --> 02:29.399
Are you still smoking?

02:29.433 --> 02:31.000
Every chance I get.

02:31.034 --> 02:33.203
Could you at least try
to cut back on smoking

02:33.237 --> 02:35.171
at least until your condition improves?

02:35.206 --> 02:38.007
You can get the antibiotics filled out

02:38.041 --> 02:40.309
at the university clinic, okay?

02:40.376 --> 02:43.512
You want to buy my last 10 copies

02:43.546 --> 02:44.747
of the <i>Street Sentinel,</i> <i>doc?</i>

02:44.781 --> 02:46.215
No, thank you. I think I will pass.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.383
There's a very good story
about the cover-up at Fukushima.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.585
Okay.

02:49.619 --> 02:51.543
That's what's gonna kill us... not tobacco.

02:51.593 --> 02:52.593
All right.

02:52.643 --> 02:54.054
[door opens]

02:54.090 --> 02:55.390
Where's Selena?

02:55.425 --> 02:56.758
She's not here.

02:56.792 --> 02:58.059
Where is she?

02:58.127 --> 03:00.128
She's not here for the day.
I'm covering for her.

03:00.162 --> 03:01.863
Would you mind stepping outside, please?

03:01.897 --> 03:04.233
Tell her Brad needs to see her.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.805
I hate line jumpers.

03:10.873 --> 03:12.173
[scoffs]

03:12.208 --> 03:16.010
Queuing up politely
is what makes us civilized.

03:16.078 --> 03:17.886
Yeah, like the former Soviet Union.

03:18.019 --> 03:19.615
They didn't make people live on the streets.

03:19.682 --> 03:20.682
TouchÃ©.

03:20.717 --> 03:22.651
You really need to buy this, doc.

03:22.685 --> 03:24.819
- Well...
- Find out the truth.

03:24.854 --> 03:27.222
I'll find out the truth when you
quit smoking. How about that?

03:27.256 --> 03:28.556
All right, Mac.

03:28.624 --> 03:31.025
Thank you.

03:31.060 --> 03:34.162
Thor: "Near death, near life."

03:34.196 --> 03:36.664
I chose the title because...

03:36.732 --> 03:39.700
Dying, strangely enough...

03:39.735 --> 03:41.369
has made me more alive.

03:41.725 --> 03:44.004
I believe there are many ways
up the mountain. [both snicker]

03:44.038 --> 03:45.832
But there <i>is</i>

03:46.273 --> 03:47.926
a mountain.

03:47.976 --> 03:50.578
And the truth is this...

03:50.646 --> 03:53.180
there is so much more to life
than we can see.

03:55.150 --> 03:56.584
Thank you.

04:02.660 --> 04:05.190
Thank you very much for
a consciousness-raising talk.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.051
Very thought-provoking.

04:06.101 --> 04:08.162
- Will you stay and sign some books?
- I think so.

04:08.229 --> 04:09.429
- [laughter]
Shahir: - Wonderful.

04:09.497 --> 04:11.298
Don't be shy.

04:11.332 --> 04:13.333
Well, there's a half-hour
I'll never get back.

04:13.401 --> 04:15.702
Really? I thought it was great.
I'm gonna go get a book.

04:15.770 --> 04:16.736
Really?

04:16.803 --> 04:18.571
Really.

04:18.639 --> 04:20.173
Should I warn her he bites?

04:20.207 --> 04:22.309
Oh, I think she can handle herself.

04:22.343 --> 04:23.343
Hi, mom.

04:23.377 --> 04:24.544
Hey, sweetheart.

04:24.578 --> 04:26.313
Oh. Clever girl.

04:26.380 --> 04:28.615
She has already found
the hospital's only good coffee.

04:28.649 --> 04:29.916
How's the first day going?

04:29.983 --> 04:31.117
Pretty good. I like it.

04:31.185 --> 04:32.819
Mm. Don't worry. That'll pass.

04:32.886 --> 04:35.288
Okay. Well, I'll talk to you guys later.

04:35.322 --> 04:37.023
- I have to go serve some mushy food.
- Mmm!

04:37.057 --> 04:38.724
She's working at the hospital, huh?

04:38.792 --> 04:40.893
Yeah, as a porter,
just till university starts.

04:40.961 --> 04:43.095
Did I tell you she won
a full scholarship at Dal?

04:43.163 --> 04:45.431
- Wow.
- Yeah, wants to study medicine.

04:45.465 --> 04:46.799
Like mother, like daughter.

04:46.834 --> 04:49.768
Well, there's trouble, huh?

04:49.836 --> 04:52.805
Excellent speech. It's really excellent.

04:52.839 --> 04:54.139
Yeah, it was.

04:54.207 --> 04:55.907
He's a very smart man.

04:55.942 --> 04:57.876
He's my doctor.

04:58.845 --> 05:00.312
Are you okay?

05:00.347 --> 05:01.980
I <i>will</i> be.

05:02.014 --> 05:03.749
Okay.

05:04.750 --> 05:06.251
Thor: Thank you.

05:07.854 --> 05:09.387
Did you page me, Dr. Harris?

05:09.421 --> 05:11.857
Yes, Rian. I'm doing <i>my</i> job,
and I'm covering for Dr. Goran.

05:11.924 --> 05:13.124
So I got a hell of a day,

05:13.159 --> 05:14.993
and you're gonna help me dig myself out.

05:15.027 --> 05:16.328
Where's Dr. Goran?

05:16.362 --> 05:17.996
Try the doghouse.

05:18.030 --> 05:19.130
Doghouse.

05:20.799 --> 05:22.333
Hey. How you doing there, boss?

05:22.368 --> 05:24.001
You do not want to know.

05:24.035 --> 05:26.036
That's why I asked...
'cause I don't want to know.

05:26.071 --> 05:29.574
I just spent the last five hours
at city hall

05:29.608 --> 05:31.642
fighting the developer
who bought the building.

05:31.677 --> 05:33.544
We're getting evicted.

05:33.579 --> 05:35.012
Okay, why didn't you tell me
there was a problem?

05:35.046 --> 05:36.414
Why? It's not your concern.

05:36.448 --> 05:38.782
I wouldn't be here
if I wasn't concerned, Selena.

05:38.816 --> 05:40.284
[sighs] I'm sorry.

05:40.318 --> 05:41.518
I'm just... I'm in a foul mood.

05:41.552 --> 05:43.120
If we don't get a last-minute reprieve,

05:43.154 --> 05:44.288
we're on the street.

05:44.322 --> 05:45.295
Which is ironic,

05:45.355 --> 05:46.581
considering that's where
most of our patients live.

05:46.689 --> 05:48.600
Okay, there must be other options for us.

05:48.697 --> 05:50.423
I've exhausted most of them.

05:50.748 --> 05:51.669
Look, it doesn't matter.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.097
How's it been going today?

05:53.164 --> 05:56.400
A guy called Brad came in looking for you.

05:56.434 --> 05:57.247
- Brad?
- Yes.

05:57.297 --> 05:58.441
He's banned from this clinic.

05:58.537 --> 06:00.871
Well, I didn't know
who he really was, so I just...

06:00.905 --> 06:01.850
Of course you didn't.

06:01.902 --> 06:03.973
Um... that's okay.

06:04.008 --> 06:05.809
Listen, thanks for covering. I got it.

06:10.180 --> 06:12.282
You know, I think I'm gonna
stick around, Selena.

06:14.318 --> 06:17.287
Could... could use a little break.

06:17.932 --> 06:20.637
Dude, if you think this place is a break,

06:20.687 --> 06:22.091
you need to get a life.

06:22.159 --> 06:24.260
Yeah, you're probably right.

06:25.629 --> 06:27.463
Hi.

06:27.531 --> 06:29.607
I loved your talk.
Gave me a lot to think about.

06:29.708 --> 06:31.382
Well, thank you... very much.

06:31.432 --> 06:32.548
Um...

06:33.329 --> 06:36.439
Uh, who should I make
the book out to, doctor...?

06:36.473 --> 06:38.206
"Alex" is fine.

06:38.274 --> 06:39.203
Okay.

06:39.832 --> 06:41.062
"To Alex."

06:41.198 --> 06:45.886
"May your trip up the mountain
be kind and clear."

06:45.974 --> 06:47.505
"Best wishes."

06:48.266 --> 06:49.584
"Thor."

06:49.652 --> 06:50.329
Thank you.

06:50.379 --> 06:51.567
Enjoy.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.110
I will.

06:53.202 --> 06:55.153
[breathing shakily]

06:55.229 --> 06:58.526
Do you... swear there's a heaven? S-swear it?

06:58.594 --> 07:00.328
Robert, please. This...
We've talked about this before.

07:00.395 --> 07:01.496
This isn't the time or the place.

07:01.564 --> 07:02.597
Swear it!

07:02.665 --> 07:04.192
Yes, Robert, I swear.

07:04.242 --> 07:06.033
I swear I saw heaven.

07:06.101 --> 07:07.702
Good.

07:07.770 --> 07:09.704
'Cause I need to go there now.

07:10.973 --> 07:11.940
No, no, no!

07:12.007 --> 07:13.107
No, no, no! Stop!

07:13.141 --> 07:14.041
[grunts]

07:14.109 --> 07:15.543
[drill whirring]

07:15.611 --> 07:17.378
[Robert groaning, crowd screaming]

07:17.446 --> 07:18.879
Aaaaaaah!

07:26.392 --> 07:29.169
Smart work detaching the drill,
without killing him, Alex.

07:29.317 --> 07:30.389
Very impressive.

07:30.439 --> 07:31.094
Thank you.

07:31.129 --> 07:32.947
And you know your way around power tools.

07:32.997 --> 07:34.047
You have to blame my brothers.

07:34.097 --> 07:35.166
They were always dragging me
into their schemes

07:35.200 --> 07:37.468
to make go-karts, road-hockey nets...

07:37.536 --> 07:38.569
I'm glad they did.

07:38.603 --> 07:39.703
So is Robert here.

07:39.771 --> 07:41.237
What were you treating him for?

07:41.272 --> 07:42.505
Depression.

07:42.573 --> 07:44.240
Why am I not surprised?

07:44.275 --> 07:46.609
Okay, everybody, let's
get him intubated and prepped
for emergency surgery.

07:46.678 --> 07:48.344
We'll bring the plates in
and shoot the X-rays here.

07:48.379 --> 07:50.413
I don't want to move him unless I have to.

07:52.684 --> 07:54.350
He drilled it into his temple?

07:54.385 --> 07:56.052
Yeah, right out in the atrium.

07:56.086 --> 07:57.587
Thor: Robert's my patient.

07:57.621 --> 07:58.988
He suffers from major depression

07:59.022 --> 08:00.290
that led to chronic insomnia.

08:00.357 --> 08:01.691
I've been treating him with DBS.

08:01.725 --> 08:04.594
Deep brain stimulation...
very effective for depression.

08:04.662 --> 08:05.861
I'd hoped so.

08:05.896 --> 08:07.963
He'd been in a spiral of suicidal fantasies.

08:08.031 --> 08:09.299
Well, I'll need a C.T.

08:09.643 --> 08:10.733
Won't be able to tell if the drill bit

08:10.767 --> 08:12.935
has penetrated his blood vessel
without more imaging.

08:12.969 --> 08:14.804
Well, every minute
you leave the metal in there

08:14.838 --> 08:16.205
puts him more in danger.

08:16.239 --> 08:17.940
Well, the risks of infection
and meningitis rises, yes.

08:17.974 --> 08:21.010
As does the risk of stroke,
if he isn't having one already.

08:21.044 --> 08:23.545
Okay, well, I'll take those
risks over a massive hemorrhage.

08:23.580 --> 08:24.980
I'm telling you, there's no time.

08:25.015 --> 08:26.348
Let me scrub in,

08:26.382 --> 08:28.717
and if the artery's pierced,
we'll handle it together.

08:28.751 --> 08:29.818
Have you heard the story

08:29.852 --> 08:31.353
of the little dutch boy, Dr. MacLeod?

08:31.387 --> 08:32.953
I'm not gonna pull out the drill

08:32.988 --> 08:36.191
and flood <i>my</i> patient
with a catastrophic bleed.

08:36.226 --> 08:37.626
What about freezing him?

08:37.659 --> 08:38.693
I beg your pardon?

08:38.727 --> 08:39.928
Partial hypothermia.

08:39.962 --> 08:41.530
We use a cordis line and a saline solution,

08:41.563 --> 08:42.964
and it lowers his body temperature.

08:42.998 --> 08:44.131
If there <i>is</i> a bleed...

08:44.166 --> 08:45.666
Buys us more time to image him.

08:45.701 --> 08:47.235
That's interesting.

08:47.269 --> 08:49.738
If by "interesting," you mean "brilliant,"

08:49.772 --> 08:52.006
then yes, it's interesting.

08:52.041 --> 08:53.708
Page me when he's ready.

08:56.545 --> 08:59.047
What do you mean you didn't bring
a lawyer to the city hall hearing?

08:59.115 --> 09:00.648
We can't afford a lawyer.

09:00.682 --> 09:02.283
Selena, there are plenty of law firms

09:02.317 --> 09:04.017
that would've taken this case pro bono.

09:04.052 --> 09:06.320
Drop it. There wasn't time, okay?

09:06.355 --> 09:07.888
Okay, you <i>make</i> time, right?

09:07.922 --> 09:10.157
We find the right lawyer.
We go back to that committee.

09:10.191 --> 09:11.271
[door opens]
Look, we need to contact the media

09:11.321 --> 09:12.053
and get the word out there.

09:12.103 --> 09:14.828
This community cannot afford
to lose this clinic.

09:14.896 --> 09:16.096
What do you mean?

09:16.164 --> 09:18.198
You're not gonna close it down, are you?

09:18.266 --> 09:20.801
Nothing's been decided, Mac.

09:20.869 --> 09:22.069
What's the truth?

09:22.137 --> 09:24.604
Okay, Mac, I saw you at least an hour ago.

09:24.639 --> 09:26.573
What are you still hanging
around here for? Can you just...

09:26.641 --> 09:28.942
Come on. Do me a solid.

09:28.977 --> 09:30.610
Please do <i>me</i> a solid and...

09:30.645 --> 09:31.645
Thank you.

09:31.712 --> 09:33.013
What's gonna happen to me?

09:33.047 --> 09:34.947
I can't go to the hospital.

09:36.317 --> 09:37.284
[sighs]

09:37.318 --> 09:38.318
Could you not discuss this

09:38.386 --> 09:39.778
in front of the patients, please?

09:39.850 --> 09:41.064
I am trying to help you, okay?

09:41.140 --> 09:42.228
- Okay.
- Well, just stop.

09:42.278 --> 09:43.922
What is with the messiah complex?

09:43.991 --> 09:45.292
What is with your wrist?

09:45.326 --> 09:46.114
Nothing!

09:46.164 --> 09:48.194
No, that is not nothing.
That is bruised and swollen.

09:48.262 --> 09:49.362
Let me take a look at that for you.

09:49.430 --> 09:50.797
Just stop.

09:51.698 --> 09:53.232
Stop helping.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.834
Okay?

09:59.572 --> 10:02.675
Okay. Talk to me about stretch marks.

10:02.742 --> 10:04.743
You sure you want
cosmetic surgery to remove them?

10:04.812 --> 10:07.680
I do. My husband will hate them.

10:08.682 --> 10:09.815
You know it's elective?

10:09.882 --> 10:11.249
We can afford it.

10:11.318 --> 10:14.653
And I can't afford <i>not</i> to,
if you know what I mean.

10:14.721 --> 10:16.888
Okay. Well, I'll book you in.

10:16.923 --> 10:18.424
Oh. My child and heir.

10:18.491 --> 10:19.758
Still loving it?

10:19.793 --> 10:21.193
Actually, as a matter of fact, I am.

10:21.227 --> 10:22.428
Ah. Well, the glamour of bedpans.

10:22.495 --> 10:23.762
[chuckles]

10:23.830 --> 10:25.831
- Can you help me to the washroom?
- Sure.

10:25.898 --> 10:28.300
My bladder is a war zone.

10:30.236 --> 10:31.402
Discharging her today.

10:31.437 --> 10:33.403
You filled the prescription for oxycodone?

10:33.453 --> 10:35.711
Yep. And barbiturates for her migraines.

10:35.761 --> 10:37.342
She knows she can't breastfeed
while she's on them?

10:37.409 --> 10:38.844
Yeah, I don't think she plans to.

10:38.911 --> 10:40.511
She's pretty body-conscious.

10:40.579 --> 10:42.246
Mm. Judging a patient, Dr. Lin?

10:42.280 --> 10:43.881
Absolutely not, Dr. Katz.

10:45.183 --> 10:46.935
- Hey.
- Um, she's in the washroom, Dr. Lin.

10:46.985 --> 10:47.837
Thanks.

10:47.957 --> 10:49.924
Have you met Dana's daughter... Molly?

10:50.004 --> 10:51.622
No. Hi. I'm Dr. Katz.

10:51.657 --> 10:52.523
Hey.

10:53.726 --> 10:56.361
"Hey." Is that a greeting... "hey"?

10:58.063 --> 10:59.063
[knocks on door]

10:59.097 --> 11:00.664
Mrs. Kovacs, it's Dr. Lin.

11:00.732 --> 11:02.466
I was just wondering if you remembered

11:02.500 --> 11:05.435
to fill your prescription for oxycodone?

11:05.503 --> 11:07.461
It's sitting on the table,
next to the other one.

11:07.521 --> 11:10.225
Okay. I don't see it.
I just see the one pill bottle.

11:10.278 --> 11:12.545
Can you stop talking to me?
I'm trying to pee.

11:12.637 --> 11:14.310
[door slams] Something wrong?

11:14.379 --> 11:15.846
I'm sure it's fine.

11:21.252 --> 11:24.588
So, this is the guy
that tried to trepan himself?

11:24.990 --> 11:26.869
Yep... right after
MacLeod finished his speech.

11:26.919 --> 11:28.784
Must've been quite a speech. [chuckles]

11:28.864 --> 11:30.860
He was one of Dr. MacLeod's patients.

11:30.895 --> 11:33.431
He's been treating him with DBS.

11:33.708 --> 11:35.498
Yeah, so, you went to hear Thor

11:35.532 --> 11:37.267
talk about his near-death experience?

11:38.259 --> 11:39.533
You sound surprised.

11:39.583 --> 11:41.685
A little, yeah.

11:42.006 --> 11:46.376
Well, what he experienced was...
interesting.

11:46.410 --> 11:49.244
Um... have you heard anything
from Joel today?

11:49.279 --> 11:50.245
No. Why?

11:50.675 --> 11:52.350
Nothing. He, uh, booked off call again,

11:52.406 --> 11:53.744
and nobody seems to know where he is.

11:53.794 --> 11:55.031
No clue.

11:55.685 --> 11:57.158
Well, if you hear anything,
you'll let me know?

11:57.208 --> 11:58.821
Sure. Will do.

12:06.762 --> 12:07.872
Hello, Charlie.

12:07.922 --> 12:09.158
Thor.

12:09.465 --> 12:10.999
I sent you a note
when I was writing my book.

12:11.034 --> 12:12.000
You didn't get it?

12:12.035 --> 12:12.832
Uh, no, no.

12:12.888 --> 12:15.163
Must've, uh, must've gone to my spam.

12:15.260 --> 12:16.790
We should get together and talk.

12:16.842 --> 12:18.453
I think we share a lot in common.

12:18.585 --> 12:21.249
Yeah, like, um, my ex-wife... Dawn?

12:21.577 --> 12:23.181
Yeah.

12:23.573 --> 12:25.292
That's not who I am anymore.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.640
And I do apologize for that.

12:27.772 --> 12:30.601
That's right. You're, uh... you almost died.

12:30.725 --> 12:32.153
Made you a famous author.

12:32.187 --> 12:33.221
I don't give a damn about that.

12:33.301 --> 12:35.388
It's the work that's important.

12:35.585 --> 12:37.275
You know, I'm writing a follow-up book,

12:37.360 --> 12:39.908
broadening the "science
versus spirituality" debate.

12:39.988 --> 12:42.131
I would love to talk to you
about your own N.D.E.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.098
What makes you think I had one?

12:44.132 --> 12:46.647
You were in a coma for months.
You came out of it.

12:46.855 --> 12:48.394
I can help you remember what happened.

12:48.506 --> 12:50.393
Oh, as far as I'm concerned, Thor,

12:50.469 --> 12:53.250
what happened to me is a-a mystery.

12:53.541 --> 12:55.609
It's a mystery we could solve together.

12:56.182 --> 12:57.452
Right.

12:57.846 --> 12:59.147
Uh, w-word has it

12:59.227 --> 13:03.118
that Dr. Reid almost died
after that terrible stabbing.

13:03.895 --> 13:05.978
Maybe she'd like to talk to me
about <i>her</i> experience.

13:06.135 --> 13:07.970
Good luck with that.

13:09.913 --> 13:11.411
All right, Mac.

13:12.533 --> 13:14.264
- Closing up.
- For good?

13:14.368 --> 13:15.991
Selena: - No, you're not listening.
- Don't know about that.

13:16.041 --> 13:18.956
No! No, it's not okay, you son of a bitch!

13:19.006 --> 13:21.315
- I don't need to calm down!
- Ah. Looks like it is. Looks like we're screwed.

13:21.365 --> 13:22.325
Come on, Mac.

13:22.375 --> 13:23.415
- Time to hit the bricks. Let's go.
- There are people

13:23.527 --> 13:26.957
- that depend on me at this place.
- Now, I only sold one.

13:27.041 --> 13:27.834
You sure you can't...

13:27.884 --> 13:29.717
[sighing] Oh, yeah.

13:30.486 --> 13:32.418
I'll take this whole bundle
for 10 bucks, right?

13:32.474 --> 13:33.704
You can make it a $20.

13:33.754 --> 13:36.825
$20 for...

13:37.851 --> 13:38.780
unbelievable.

13:38.830 --> 13:40.431
There you go.

13:48.287 --> 13:50.162
[chuckles]

13:52.430 --> 13:54.157
I take it they turned you down.

13:54.225 --> 13:55.551
No reprieve.

13:55.639 --> 13:57.703
We have to be out by the end of the week.

13:57.787 --> 13:59.810
So we fight it. You know?

13:59.914 --> 14:01.938
Or we find the clinic
another rent-free space.

14:02.018 --> 14:05.672
[sighs] In a city that's
turning into one giant condo?

14:05.744 --> 14:06.706
Ow.

14:06.782 --> 14:07.723
This is ridiculous.

14:07.803 --> 14:09.758
Selena, let me look at the wrist. Come on.

14:10.620 --> 14:12.158
- [sighs]
- There.

14:12.230 --> 14:13.885
Fine. Play doctor.

14:16.045 --> 14:17.792
[sighs]

14:20.997 --> 14:22.800
- Does that hurt there?
- Uh-huh.

14:22.850 --> 14:23.890
Okay.

14:25.264 --> 14:27.331
- And what about...
- Aah!

14:27.366 --> 14:28.729
[inhales sharply]

14:28.874 --> 14:29.939
Your wrist is broken.

14:30.023 --> 14:33.403
- No, it's not.
- Selena, you know that your wrist is broken.

14:37.239 --> 14:40.044
This is an awesome day.

14:40.809 --> 14:42.546
Thor: Stay with us, Robert.

14:43.149 --> 14:45.268
Everything's gonna be okay.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.272
You honestly believe that he can hear you?

14:47.372 --> 14:48.862
I did when they operated on <i>me.</i>

14:48.954 --> 14:50.052
I remember hearing the surgeon say

14:50.156 --> 14:52.821
I only had a 15% chance of survival.

14:53.326 --> 14:56.371
So I am careful what the O.R. team says

14:56.447 --> 14:58.895
when my patient is in a liminal state.

14:59.524 --> 15:00.537
I'll take that under advisement.

15:00.587 --> 15:02.016
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

15:02.328 --> 15:03.723
What about you, Alex?

15:03.871 --> 15:04.824
Do you remember hearing the doctors talk

15:04.908 --> 15:06.820
when they saved your life?

15:08.935 --> 15:10.321
I'm sorry. What?

15:10.518 --> 15:11.796
You were stabbed, right?

15:11.846 --> 15:13.655
Yes. And I'm fine now.

15:13.877 --> 15:14.944
[machine beeping]

15:15.366 --> 15:17.505
Rian: He's cold as ice now, Dr. Reid.

15:17.593 --> 15:18.759
All right, let's move him to imaging

15:18.863 --> 15:20.249
and get Shahir that C.T. he needs.

15:20.338 --> 15:21.423
And let's hurry, people.

15:21.500 --> 15:23.331
I don't want to keep him hypothermic
longer than we have to.

15:23.381 --> 15:25.054
You got it.

15:25.089 --> 15:27.156
O-kay.

15:27.190 --> 15:28.658
What's next, chief?

15:28.692 --> 15:30.860
Uh, hip replacement.

15:30.928 --> 15:33.529
Another one of the many balls
that Dr. Goran dropped.

15:33.597 --> 15:36.165
Okay if I hit the can first?

15:36.233 --> 15:39.801
Adult diapers were made
for days like this, young jedi.

15:40.671 --> 15:41.904
Go.

15:41.972 --> 15:43.139
Okay.

15:46.844 --> 15:47.944
[sighs]

15:50.648 --> 15:52.248
Help me.

15:54.317 --> 15:56.718
He lied to me.

15:56.753 --> 16:01.490
He told me there was a heaven,
but I can't find it.

16:01.525 --> 16:04.026
Help me.

16:10.915 --> 16:11.525
Right here.

16:11.621 --> 16:13.284
The drill bit is pressing into an artery

16:13.353 --> 16:15.320
very near one of the patient's
dbs electrodes.

16:15.388 --> 16:16.321
See?

16:16.389 --> 16:17.723
Piercing the artery?

16:17.790 --> 16:19.690
Yes, the danger of bleeding is real. Look.

16:19.758 --> 16:22.560
Just say the word,
and I'll step in and help.

16:24.029 --> 16:26.364
How many neurosurgeons does
it take to change a light bulb?

16:26.398 --> 16:27.531
I don't know.

16:28.433 --> 16:30.235
One.

16:30.510 --> 16:32.588
Don't worry. Shahir is excellent.

16:32.671 --> 16:34.739
I'm sure he is.

16:35.812 --> 16:38.108
I hate to leave my patient, but...

16:38.142 --> 16:39.710
I'd love to buy you a latte.

16:39.778 --> 16:40.944
Sure.

16:41.012 --> 16:42.404
Robert: I don't get it.

16:42.562 --> 16:45.583
There's no white light, no warm glows.

16:45.617 --> 16:47.585
Where are the heralding angels?

16:47.652 --> 16:51.221
You know, I haven't heard
one trumpet. Not one trumpet.

16:53.324 --> 16:54.591
I'm so tired.

16:54.658 --> 16:56.426
I need to sleep, but I can't.

16:56.494 --> 16:58.128
Why? Why can't you sleep?

16:58.196 --> 17:00.063
Well, in case she comes back.

17:00.131 --> 17:01.398
Who?

17:01.432 --> 17:03.033
Ellen, my wife.

17:03.067 --> 17:04.233
She went out for a walk.

17:04.269 --> 17:06.669
She said she'd be back in an hour.

17:06.704 --> 17:09.038
That was a year ago, and...

17:14.044 --> 17:15.545
Hey!

17:15.579 --> 17:17.814
- Where'd you go?
- What?

17:23.020 --> 17:24.020
Hey, Molly.

17:24.054 --> 17:25.021
Hey.

17:25.088 --> 17:26.289
Can I ask you a question?

17:26.323 --> 17:27.656
Sure.

17:27.690 --> 17:30.359
You know that patient
you helped earlier, Mrs. Kovacs?

17:30.394 --> 17:31.560
Mm-hmm.

17:31.594 --> 17:33.262
Her painkillers are missing.

17:33.297 --> 17:34.496
Okay.

17:34.531 --> 17:35.631
And?

17:35.665 --> 17:37.099
Sorry to ask you this.

17:37.134 --> 17:39.601
I was just wondering if you took them.

17:39.636 --> 17:41.503
Maybe by accident?

17:41.538 --> 17:43.071
What are you talking about?

17:43.105 --> 17:45.140
I can't think of another explanation.

17:45.174 --> 17:46.141
Okay.

17:46.175 --> 17:47.509
Well, here's another explanation.

17:47.544 --> 17:48.811
You're insane.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:58.421 --> 18:00.221
Something more important than this?

18:00.256 --> 18:01.689
It's personal.

18:05.027 --> 18:06.727
I get that you're guarded, Alex.

18:06.762 --> 18:08.096
What does that mean?

18:08.130 --> 18:09.597
Well, I was, too.

18:09.631 --> 18:12.000
You're afraid that it's real.
You're afraid that it's <i>not.</i>

18:12.034 --> 18:13.668
Honestly?

18:15.303 --> 18:18.405
When you were speaking
about being outside of your body

18:18.440 --> 18:20.975
and seeing yourself being operated on,

18:21.009 --> 18:22.777
I think I saw that, too.

18:22.845 --> 18:24.211
Remote viewing.

18:24.245 --> 18:25.813
Do you remember anything else?

18:27.280 --> 18:30.084
Maybe some images of my father.

18:30.118 --> 18:31.352
Happy ones, I hope.

18:31.386 --> 18:33.487
I don't know. It's hazy.

18:33.521 --> 18:34.654
Mm.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.357
There are some meditations I can suggest

18:36.391 --> 18:37.624
to help you remember more.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.994
[cellphone vibrates]

18:40.028 --> 18:41.962
Excuse me.

18:42.030 --> 18:43.864
Don't be afraid, Alex.

18:43.898 --> 18:46.733
Trust me... these experiences are a gift.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.135
But...

18:49.203 --> 18:51.505
I'm sorry if I pried.

18:51.572 --> 18:53.072
Don't be.

19:02.182 --> 19:03.282
[tool whirring]

19:03.317 --> 19:05.051
[yawning]

19:07.087 --> 19:08.621
Am I boring you, Dr. Larouche?

19:08.688 --> 19:09.822
No. I'm sorry.

19:09.890 --> 19:11.557
It's just, uh, Dr. Harris has been

19:11.625 --> 19:13.659
running me really hard all day.

19:13.727 --> 19:15.294
Hmm. I always thought you were an athlete.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.295
Hmm.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.631
It's a different running.

19:18.698 --> 19:20.166
[whirring continues]

19:20.234 --> 19:22.034
This is a pretty intense injury.

19:22.101 --> 19:23.168
[scoffs]

19:23.202 --> 19:24.570
I once had to pull a crossbow arrow

19:24.604 --> 19:25.871
out of a man's anterior lobe.

19:25.939 --> 19:27.006
Geez.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.340
The wife claims it was an accident.

19:28.408 --> 19:29.708
[chuckling] Oh, my gosh.

19:29.776 --> 19:31.376
People are crazy.

19:31.444 --> 19:33.012
Okay. We're ready.

19:33.079 --> 19:35.447
Please pull the drill bit out

19:35.515 --> 19:37.087
while I see if the artery
needs to be clamped.

19:37.550 --> 19:40.018
Yeah, so just... just... just pull it?

19:40.086 --> 19:41.486
Yes. Carefully, of course.

19:41.554 --> 19:43.088
[clears throat] Okay.

19:48.761 --> 19:50.995
Okay, it's bleeding. Microscope in.

19:57.269 --> 19:59.103
Need a clip.

19:59.137 --> 20:00.438
Do you know the story

20:00.505 --> 20:01.706
of the little dutch boy, Dr. Larouche?

20:01.740 --> 20:02.740
Finger in the...

20:02.775 --> 20:04.108
Wait.

20:04.142 --> 20:06.444
[suction]

20:06.511 --> 20:08.046
This is odd.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.280
Wait. Uh, what's odd?

20:09.347 --> 20:11.682
The DBS implant appears to be misplaced.

20:11.749 --> 20:13.350
Well, could it have moved
because of the, um...

20:13.418 --> 20:14.585
I don't know... head drilling?

20:14.619 --> 20:16.387
Quite possibly. I'll need an MRI to confirm.

20:16.844 --> 20:17.854
Can we reduce the saline solution

20:17.889 --> 20:19.457
and bring him back in from the cold?

20:19.491 --> 20:20.491
Sure can.

20:20.525 --> 20:21.233
Thank you.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.789
[machine beeps] Okay.

20:25.930 --> 20:27.731
So, how did you fall off your bike?

20:30.768 --> 20:32.769
âª time slips through like dust âª

20:32.804 --> 20:35.005
So you don't remember
how you broke your wrist?

20:37.508 --> 20:39.977
âª where did you go? âª
âª Where did you go?âª

20:40.011 --> 20:41.878
What are you doing here, Joel?

20:41.913 --> 20:44.487
- âª I'm gonna let that ghost sleep âª
- What are you hiding from?

20:44.595 --> 20:46.209
What are <i>you</i> hiding from?

20:47.751 --> 20:51.854
- âª I'm gonna let it go âª
- Shouldn't you be at the hospital?

20:51.888 --> 20:53.022
What is it?

20:53.056 --> 20:54.023
Work?

20:54.057 --> 20:55.525
âª I'm gonna let it go âª

20:55.559 --> 20:57.527
Is it about a girl?

20:57.561 --> 20:59.729
[chuckles]

20:59.763 --> 21:03.232
âª I'm gonna let it go âª

21:03.266 --> 21:04.800
You know what your problem is?

21:04.835 --> 21:06.502
âª where did it? âª

21:07.904 --> 21:10.172
You talk too much.

21:10.206 --> 21:11.807
âª oh, oh, oh âª

21:11.842 --> 21:12.942
âª where did it? âª

21:12.976 --> 21:14.143
âª oh, oh, oh âª

21:14.177 --> 21:15.144
âª where did you? âª

21:15.178 --> 21:17.479
âª oh, oh, oh, oh, oh âª

21:17.514 --> 21:18.480
âª where did it? âª

21:18.515 --> 21:19.615
âª oh, oh, oh âª

21:19.649 --> 21:20.882
âª where did you? âª

21:20.916 --> 21:22.351
âª oh, oh, oh, oh, oh âª

21:22.385 --> 21:24.019
âª I'm gonna let it go âª

21:24.053 --> 21:25.954
âª oh, oh, oh âª

21:25.988 --> 21:27.956
âª where did it? âª

21:28.024 --> 21:30.359
âª I'm gonna let that ghost sleep âª

21:30.426 --> 21:31.726
âª oh, oh, oh âª

âª where did it? âª

21:32.828 --> 21:33.928
âª oh, oh, oh âª

21:33.996 --> 21:37.766
âª I'm gonna let that ghost sleep âª

21:39.001 --> 21:40.516
[inhales deeply]

21:40.599 --> 21:41.661
[knocks on door]

21:41.744 --> 21:44.139
Sorry to disturb you,
Dr. Kinney. Is this a bad time?

21:44.173 --> 21:45.373
[keyboard clacking] Yeah.

21:46.475 --> 21:47.809
Okay. Uh...

21:47.843 --> 21:49.510
There's no easy way to say this.

21:49.578 --> 21:51.579
My patient is missing some painkillers,

21:51.613 --> 21:53.614
and I can't think of another explanation

21:53.682 --> 21:55.216
except that Molly took them.

21:55.250 --> 21:56.950
I'm sorry. I just... I can't.

21:57.018 --> 21:58.886
And I thought you should know.

22:03.024 --> 22:05.560
[keys clacking]

22:05.627 --> 22:06.860
You can go.

22:09.100 --> 22:09.909
Okay.

22:09.992 --> 22:11.017
[clears throat]

22:16.838 --> 22:18.638
I removed the drill bit
from his frontal lobe,

22:18.707 --> 22:20.107
repaired his artery.

22:20.141 --> 22:22.642
He'll need to be monitored
for stroke, but he's doing okay.

22:22.710 --> 22:25.078
Great. Thank you.

22:25.145 --> 22:26.313
I do have some concerns

22:26.380 --> 22:28.615
about the placement of his DBS electrode.

22:29.750 --> 22:30.950
Well, how so?

22:30.984 --> 22:33.253
They seem to have migrated.
I'm doing an MRI.

22:33.321 --> 22:34.987
It's not life-threatening.

22:35.022 --> 22:36.989
I'll start arranging for a patient transfer,

22:37.057 --> 22:39.859
and <i>I</i> will give him a full MRI
when he's back in my care.

22:39.927 --> 22:42.729
But when he's in <i>your</i> care,
he won't be in <i>my</i> care.

22:42.796 --> 22:44.831
Exactly.

22:44.865 --> 22:47.967
And I thought
<i>orthopods</i> were territorial.

22:49.336 --> 22:51.270
[monitors beeping loudly] He's spiking!

22:51.304 --> 22:52.805
Status.

22:52.873 --> 22:54.607
Systolic near 220.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.141
Diastolic at 144!

22:56.175 --> 22:57.376
He's in hypertensive crisis.

22:57.444 --> 22:58.844
Let's get some labetalol nitro now.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.345
His heart's gonna pop at these levels!

23:00.412 --> 23:02.214
Alex: Come on, Robert. Stay with us.

23:02.281 --> 23:04.616
Come on, Robert.

23:04.683 --> 23:06.417
Hang in there.

23:09.153 --> 23:11.321
It's not meningitis.

23:11.355 --> 23:13.856
Could be an infection
in the cerebrospinal fluid.

23:13.924 --> 23:16.559
No, I don't think so. Look at this.

23:16.593 --> 23:18.194
His body's producing way too much cortisol.

23:18.228 --> 23:19.462
His levels are off the charts.

23:19.496 --> 23:21.130
That would explain the crazy blood pressure.

23:21.165 --> 23:23.132
Exactly. But what explains
the cortisol, hmm?

23:23.167 --> 23:25.401
Well, there's no sign
of an adrenal tumor on the C.T.

23:25.436 --> 23:27.570
I'll order up another test.
Do you want bloodwork?

23:27.604 --> 23:28.637
Okay.

23:28.672 --> 23:29.905
What's Robert's status?

23:29.973 --> 23:31.106
Is he okay?

23:31.174 --> 23:32.741
No. He's not out of the woods yet.

23:32.776 --> 23:34.477
I'll go arrange for those tests.

23:34.511 --> 23:35.744
Thanks.

23:35.779 --> 23:37.580
[elevator bell dings]

23:49.525 --> 23:51.893
So, uh, you an angel?

23:53.363 --> 23:55.263
No.

23:55.298 --> 23:57.899
I'm so tired.

23:57.933 --> 23:59.367
I just need to find her.

23:59.401 --> 24:01.469
I looked everywhere.

24:01.504 --> 24:04.438
Where are you hiding her?

24:04.473 --> 24:06.173
Your wife's not here.

24:06.208 --> 24:08.743
Trust me... I-I'd see her if she was.

24:08.777 --> 24:10.845
I feel like I'm caught between two worlds,

24:10.880 --> 24:12.947
and she's not in either.

24:12.982 --> 24:15.383
Yeah, I know that feeling.

24:15.417 --> 24:16.550
Do you?

24:16.584 --> 24:17.784
'Cause I don't unders...

24:17.819 --> 24:19.186
[whoosh]

24:27.429 --> 24:28.829
[snaps fingers]

24:33.835 --> 24:35.335
So... you hungry or any...

24:35.369 --> 24:37.303
I mean, do you feel like a bite to eat?

24:37.371 --> 24:39.673
N-no.

24:39.707 --> 24:41.742
Or a drink, maybe? I don't know.

24:41.776 --> 24:44.745
I'm... not really thirsty.

24:44.812 --> 24:48.614
'Kay. No drinks and/or foodstuffs.

24:50.051 --> 24:51.384
Okay. Should we talk about this?

24:51.452 --> 24:52.585
Nope.

24:54.221 --> 24:55.755
Well, I should probably
give you a ride home.

24:55.822 --> 24:57.823
I don't think you should be
driving with a broken wrist.

24:57.858 --> 24:59.959
Uh, I'm good.

25:03.497 --> 25:05.565
You're all business. You know that?

25:07.300 --> 25:08.868
Am I?

25:08.902 --> 25:10.903
[cellphone vibrates]

25:15.408 --> 25:16.842
Something important?

25:16.910 --> 25:18.744
No.

25:22.682 --> 25:24.015
[liquid pours]

25:24.084 --> 25:26.418
Dr. Hamza just told me
about Robert's cortisol levels.

25:26.486 --> 25:28.187
You're thinking it's an adrenal tumor?

25:28.254 --> 25:30.589
That makes sense, but it's not
showing up on the C.T.,

25:30.656 --> 25:32.124
So we've ordered him another one.

25:32.158 --> 25:33.258
Good.

25:34.860 --> 25:37.862
You know, full disclosure, Alex...

25:37.897 --> 25:39.998
I want to write a book
that documents the patterns

25:40.066 --> 25:42.767
found in varying experiences of near-death.

25:42.835 --> 25:46.137
I'd be honored
if you'd talk to me about yours.

25:46.205 --> 25:48.339
I, uh...

25:48.407 --> 25:50.374
I don't think I have anything more to say.

25:50.409 --> 25:52.310
Well, it's okay if you're
not ready. How's tomorrow?

25:52.377 --> 25:53.612
[chuckles]

25:53.679 --> 25:54.979
- You like merlot?
- [laughs]

25:55.046 --> 25:56.747
Just think about it.

25:57.749 --> 25:59.450
I'll think about it.

26:01.186 --> 26:02.553
- Question.
- Mm-hmm?

26:02.588 --> 26:04.955
Dr. Hamza's not gonna
subject Robert to an MRI, is he?

26:04.990 --> 26:07.525
Well, you already said that
you'd prefer to give him an MRI

26:07.593 --> 26:09.627
after he'd been transferred
to your care, so...

26:09.694 --> 26:11.629
Well, there's no reason
if it's an adrenal tumor.

26:11.663 --> 26:12.796
Right.

26:12.864 --> 26:14.031
[chuckles]

26:14.065 --> 26:15.899
I guess I'm a bit possessive of my patients.

26:15.967 --> 26:17.300
I got that.

26:17.335 --> 26:19.069
It's just that Robert's
been through so much already,

26:19.104 --> 26:20.904
and I feel like I should be the one

26:20.972 --> 26:22.740
to see him through this difficult journey.

26:22.774 --> 26:24.141
Of course.

26:26.978 --> 26:28.245
We'll talk soon.

26:38.722 --> 26:39.922
You said you thought

26:39.957 --> 26:42.325
our patient's DBS leads might've migrated.

26:42.360 --> 26:43.326
Yes.

26:43.394 --> 26:45.028
Possibly because of the trauma.

26:45.062 --> 26:48.297
Do you think they were
incorrectly positioned from the start?

26:48.331 --> 26:49.598
Could that have caused

26:49.633 --> 26:51.367
the excessive cortisol levels we saw?

26:51.401 --> 26:52.702
Maybe, but the electrodes

26:52.770 --> 26:54.737
would have to be placed
too deeply in the hypothalamus.

26:54.772 --> 26:57.173
But that would be a big mistake
for <i>any</i> neurosurgeon to make.

26:57.207 --> 26:59.608
I think you should do that MRI.

26:59.643 --> 27:00.576
Why?

27:00.610 --> 27:02.178
Let's just say I'm starting

27:02.212 --> 27:04.346
to have my doubts about heaven.

27:05.108 --> 27:06.743
[inhales sharply] Shahir.

27:06.992 --> 27:08.584
- Uh, quick theoretical.
- About?

27:08.618 --> 27:10.619
- Your patient, actually.
- Have you been talking to Alex?

27:10.654 --> 27:11.453
No. Why?

27:11.488 --> 27:13.121
N-never mind. Go on.

27:13.156 --> 27:15.257
Uh, could DBS leads make insomnia worse

27:15.292 --> 27:16.559
rather than better?

27:16.593 --> 27:17.726
The short answer is "yes."

27:17.760 --> 27:18.538
Right.

27:18.625 --> 27:21.830
What about, uh, seizures
or... out-of-body sensations?

27:21.898 --> 27:23.331
"Yes" to seizures,

27:23.365 --> 27:25.567
and the jury's out
on the whole out-of-body thing.

27:25.601 --> 27:27.169
- Right.
- Right.

27:27.203 --> 27:28.369
Thank you.

27:28.404 --> 27:29.637
[door opens]

27:29.672 --> 27:32.841
Everything is so fascinating today.

27:32.909 --> 27:34.275
Mm.

27:38.314 --> 27:40.915
I think...

27:40.949 --> 27:43.050
I've figured out why you can't sleep.

27:43.085 --> 27:44.885
I <i>told</i> you why.

27:44.953 --> 27:46.688
Listen, just hear me out, okay?

27:46.722 --> 27:48.022
I think the DBS implants

27:48.056 --> 27:49.857
that are supposed to be
helping with your depression

27:49.925 --> 27:51.592
are actually causing little seizures,

27:51.659 --> 27:53.427
which are preventing you from sleeping.

27:53.461 --> 27:54.461
It doesn't matter.

27:54.529 --> 27:55.796
Even if you're right,

27:55.831 --> 27:57.798
I'm not gonna be able to sleep
until I find my wife.

27:57.866 --> 27:59.200
Okay.

27:59.267 --> 28:00.667
Um...

28:00.736 --> 28:03.070
I underwent DBS once, and it...

28:03.138 --> 28:05.539
it helped me remember things...
important things...

28:05.607 --> 28:08.041
things I thought I'd forgotten.

28:08.109 --> 28:10.677
So tell me what happened
the night she left you.

28:10.712 --> 28:12.879
[sighs] I told you.

28:12.913 --> 28:15.782
She went out for a walk,
said she'd be back in an hour.

28:15.850 --> 28:17.083
Told me not to wait up.

28:17.151 --> 28:17.984
Then what?

28:18.052 --> 28:19.786
I don't know.

28:19.820 --> 28:21.988
"Don't wait up, Robert.
I'll be back in an hour."

28:22.022 --> 28:23.056
- Don't.
- Then what?

28:23.124 --> 28:25.258
You are not Ellen, so don't.

28:28.062 --> 28:30.964
"I'll be back in an hour."

28:31.031 --> 28:32.465
Then what?

28:32.499 --> 28:34.868
I panicked.

28:34.902 --> 28:37.070
She wasn't answering her cellphone.

28:37.138 --> 28:39.838
I searched. I searched.
I was gone all night.

28:39.906 --> 28:40.973
I...

28:41.040 --> 28:43.208
then I thought maybe...

28:43.277 --> 28:46.545
maybe she was with someone.

28:46.613 --> 28:48.046
How could I think that?

28:51.951 --> 28:55.688
There were... there were cops.

28:55.756 --> 28:57.790
There were cops when I got home.

29:01.394 --> 29:03.528
They said there was a drunk driver.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.201
She died.

29:10.837 --> 29:13.237
[voice breaking]
Why can't I hold that in my mind?

29:13.272 --> 29:15.006
She died.

29:15.073 --> 29:17.008
Why can't I remember that?

29:17.042 --> 29:20.545
'Cause if you remembered it,
then you'd have to let her go.

29:23.282 --> 29:25.650
Dr. MacLeod says
there's spirits all around us.

29:25.685 --> 29:27.185
We just can't see them.

29:27.219 --> 29:30.587
Well, maybe we're not meant to.

29:31.556 --> 29:33.324
I have to see her.

29:33.358 --> 29:35.292
I have to tell her I'm sorry.

29:37.295 --> 29:39.495
I should never have let her go that night.

29:39.563 --> 29:42.165
She didn't abandon you.

29:43.701 --> 29:45.768
She was taken from you.

29:49.207 --> 29:51.107
[keyboard clacking]

29:51.142 --> 29:52.442
Hey!

29:52.509 --> 29:55.804
Question... do these pants make me look fat?

29:55.970 --> 29:57.246
Fat? You look like a plank.

29:57.280 --> 29:58.381
[giggles]

29:58.449 --> 30:00.115
So, how was your first day? All good?

30:00.150 --> 30:01.551
Yeah, yeah, it was fine.

30:01.585 --> 30:02.819
Um...

30:02.853 --> 30:05.120
But I don't think, uh,
Dr. Lin likes me very much.

30:05.155 --> 30:06.288
Really? Why do you say that?

30:06.323 --> 30:07.757
I don't know. It was weird.

30:07.791 --> 30:09.959
She actually accused me of
stealing a patient's medication.

30:09.993 --> 30:11.727
- Couldn't believe it.
- Hmm.

30:11.761 --> 30:14.096
Well, I'm sure it's just
some sort of misunderstanding.

30:14.130 --> 30:15.764
Yeah... her misunderstanding.

30:15.798 --> 30:16.765
[chuckles]

30:16.799 --> 30:18.234
Anyway, do you think

30:18.268 --> 30:19.869
you can drop me off at Gracie's
on the way home?

30:19.903 --> 30:21.170
I want to meet some friends there.

30:21.204 --> 30:22.304
Uh, sure.

30:22.339 --> 30:23.939
Listen, I've got about another hour here,

30:23.974 --> 30:25.240
so why don't you, uh, run down

30:25.274 --> 30:26.742
and grab yourself something to eat?

30:26.776 --> 30:28.710
Mom. The food here is gross.

30:28.745 --> 30:30.412
Go eat, plank.

30:49.164 --> 30:51.132
Mom? What are you doing?

30:51.166 --> 30:52.800
Honey, I just...

30:52.834 --> 30:54.535
Ugh! I cannot believe this!

30:54.569 --> 30:55.770
What... you actually believe <i>her?!</i>

30:55.837 --> 30:57.171
- No, I didn't say that.
- You do!

30:57.206 --> 30:58.105
What is wrong with you?!

30:58.172 --> 30:59.407
Uh, honey, calm down.

30:59.474 --> 31:01.842
You are such a good liar,
asking me how my day was!

31:01.877 --> 31:03.677
You actually think I would steal
a patient's drugs?!

31:03.745 --> 31:06.179
Get a good look, mom! Get a good look!

31:09.651 --> 31:11.952
So, you sure you don't want a lift home?

31:11.986 --> 31:14.754
Throw the bike on the back of the car.

31:14.822 --> 31:16.423
[sighs]

31:16.490 --> 31:17.958
Joel, this was a mistake.

31:17.992 --> 31:20.260
Well, I-I don't necessarily think that we...

31:20.328 --> 31:21.328
It's okay.

31:21.362 --> 31:23.263
It was a <i>good</i> mistake.

31:24.232 --> 31:27.000
But we both know it was a mistake.

31:28.036 --> 31:29.369
You're a good guy.

31:29.437 --> 31:32.138
There are many that would
disagree with you, so...

31:32.172 --> 31:33.506
[bicycle bell rings] Well...

31:34.742 --> 31:36.709
[laughs]

31:36.744 --> 31:38.711
She's wrong.

31:40.714 --> 31:42.014
And it's her loss.

31:45.619 --> 31:46.886
Take care, Joel.

31:59.232 --> 32:00.366
- [gasps]
- I'll kill you!

32:00.434 --> 32:01.500
[horn honks] I'll kill you!

32:01.568 --> 32:04.069
I'm gonna knock your teeth out!

32:04.136 --> 32:05.604
[grunts]

32:15.782 --> 32:17.883
[breathing heavily]

32:21.487 --> 32:23.154
Brad?

32:27.226 --> 32:28.626
Brad?

32:41.185 --> 32:42.885
[siren wails]

32:42.920 --> 32:44.087
[police radio chatter]

32:44.121 --> 32:45.088
Zach: Joel.

32:45.122 --> 32:46.223
His skull's been fractured.

32:46.290 --> 32:47.524
I need to get him to surgery right away.

32:47.558 --> 32:48.891
- You were at the scene?
- Yeah, I-I...

32:48.926 --> 32:50.927
The guy pulled me out of my car,
starts whaling on me.

32:50.961 --> 32:52.729
I just... I hit him back, you know?

32:52.763 --> 32:54.793
You should've waited for the paramedics
and let the cops handle this.

32:54.896 --> 32:56.917
I was just trying to save his life.
Just step back, Joel.

32:57.012 --> 32:59.335
Okay, on 3. 1, 2, 3!

32:59.369 --> 33:00.369
[grunts]

33:00.403 --> 33:01.904
So, did this guy mug you?

33:01.939 --> 33:04.707
I don't know, man. He just came
out of nowhere... it was ju...

33:04.742 --> 33:06.141
We need to contact his family.

33:06.175 --> 33:08.525
- Do you know anybody?
- Um, Selena.

33:09.112 --> 33:10.779
Do you know this guy?

33:10.813 --> 33:12.748
Brad. That's... that's all I know about him.

33:12.782 --> 33:14.049
His name is Brad.

33:14.083 --> 33:15.451
I don't think he's gonna make it.

33:18.455 --> 33:21.056
[monitors beeping rapidly]

33:21.090 --> 33:22.924
Nurse: He's crashing. [flatline]

33:22.959 --> 33:24.059
Paddles.

33:25.427 --> 33:26.494
- Want to take over?
Zach: - Yep.

33:26.528 --> 33:28.130
[grunts]

33:28.197 --> 33:30.665
[defibrillator whining]

33:32.668 --> 33:34.602
And clear!

33:34.670 --> 33:36.772
[thump]

33:36.806 --> 33:38.673
[flatline continues]

33:39.975 --> 33:42.009
[defibrillator whining]
Still in V-fib. Going again.

33:42.043 --> 33:42.977
Jesus, no.

33:43.044 --> 33:44.512
Clear!

33:44.546 --> 33:45.580
[thump]

33:45.614 --> 33:46.947
[flatline continues]

33:46.982 --> 33:49.350
Nothing, doctor. He's gone.

33:49.385 --> 33:51.118
He's gone when I <i>say</i> he's gone.

33:51.186 --> 33:52.553
[defibrillator whining] Going again.

33:53.522 --> 33:54.622
Clear!

33:54.657 --> 33:55.923
[thump]

33:55.991 --> 33:57.624
Your hunch was right, Alex.

33:57.692 --> 33:59.960
His DBS implants are
in completely the wrong place.

33:59.995 --> 34:01.495
Well, they're off by millimeters,

34:01.562 --> 34:02.863
but it makes a big difference.

34:02.898 --> 34:04.364
What are they doing to him?

34:04.399 --> 34:06.133
Among other things, his brain is
producing excessive cortisol.

34:06.168 --> 34:07.634
[sighs] No wonder he went crazy.

34:07.669 --> 34:09.103
Indeed.

34:09.137 --> 34:11.438
I'll have to go in and operate
and reposition his implants.

34:11.472 --> 34:12.972
Okay, let's go tell him.

34:13.040 --> 34:14.641
Alex, our patient's unconscious.

34:14.708 --> 34:16.042
No... Dr. MacLeod.

34:16.110 --> 34:17.476
Oh, <i>him.</i>

34:17.545 --> 34:20.847
You're kidding. Dr. Harris
wears diapers in the O.R.?

34:20.915 --> 34:23.016
I don't know. I think he meant it as a joke.

34:23.050 --> 34:24.150
- At least, I hope...
- What the hell are you doing

34:24.185 --> 34:26.353
accusing my daughter of stealing drugs?

34:26.420 --> 34:28.321
- Dana, I just...
- You made me distrust her.

34:28.388 --> 34:29.922
Maybe I should search <i>you</i>
<i>for drugs.</i>

34:29.956 --> 34:31.389
How would you feel if I did that?

34:31.425 --> 34:33.193
Uh, Dr. Kinney, just, please...

34:33.260 --> 34:34.493
Please what?!

34:35.286 --> 34:38.130
You stay away from my daughter...
you and your gossipy little group.

34:38.199 --> 34:39.966
These are the kinds of lies
that ruin careers.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.635
And I hear one more word about
this, and I take legal action.

34:42.703 --> 34:44.704
Do you understand me?

34:51.511 --> 34:53.579
The proof is right there before your eyes.

34:55.581 --> 34:56.849
Fine.

34:56.882 --> 34:58.718
I give you permission
to reposition the DBS leads.

34:58.785 --> 35:01.253
I don't <i>need</i> <i>your permission.</i>

35:01.321 --> 35:03.255
Look, we all make mistakes, Dr. MacLeod,

35:03.289 --> 35:05.490
but rarely ones this excessive.

35:07.793 --> 35:09.294
It wasn't a mistake.

35:09.362 --> 35:11.063
I can't prove it, but I know that you put

35:11.130 --> 35:13.298
those DBS implants exactly
where you wanted them to be.

35:13.333 --> 35:14.733
Careful, Alex.

35:14.767 --> 35:16.401
It's why you wanted Robert
transferred back to your care.

35:16.435 --> 35:17.569
You're out of line here.

35:17.603 --> 35:19.070
You experimented on him.

35:19.104 --> 35:20.238
You were trying to induce

35:20.272 --> 35:21.706
a near-death experience in your patient

35:21.741 --> 35:23.241
so that you could prove your theories

35:23.308 --> 35:25.109
about "remote viewing,"
your theory of heaven.

35:25.143 --> 35:26.177
Now you're reaching.

35:26.245 --> 35:27.412
He could have died today.

35:27.446 --> 35:29.313
Not "nearly"... permanently.

35:29.348 --> 35:30.548
No heaven or hell.

35:30.583 --> 35:32.216
You saw something, Alex...

35:32.251 --> 35:35.920
something in the liminal state
between life and death.

35:35.988 --> 35:38.890
Whatever happened, it changed you.

35:38.924 --> 35:39.991
No.

35:40.025 --> 35:42.659
It changed <i>you,</i> <i>Dr. MacLeod.</i>

36:01.478 --> 36:04.247
I'm sorry, man.

36:04.282 --> 36:06.249
We did everything we could.

36:13.189 --> 36:14.824
It was <i>one</i> punch.

36:50.626 --> 36:53.628
Someone should notify the family.

36:53.663 --> 36:55.229
You just did.

36:58.300 --> 37:00.735
He's my husband.

37:21.591 --> 37:23.559
[snoring]

37:32.101 --> 37:33.835
[whoosh]

37:33.903 --> 37:34.903
Where am I?

37:34.971 --> 37:37.005
You were asleep.

37:37.073 --> 37:38.574
[scoffs]

37:38.642 --> 37:39.808
That's impossible.

37:39.876 --> 37:40.976
No, it's true.

37:41.010 --> 37:42.811
You were snoring away like a champion.

37:42.879 --> 37:44.445
[chuckles]

37:45.514 --> 37:46.648
Will I remember this?

37:46.716 --> 37:49.250
I don't know.

37:49.318 --> 37:51.019
I hope so.

37:53.122 --> 37:54.956
I will.

37:55.024 --> 37:57.159
I'll remember she didn't leave me.

37:59.995 --> 38:01.062
You talking to yourself?

38:01.096 --> 38:02.497
[gasps softly]

38:02.531 --> 38:04.098
Yeah.

38:04.166 --> 38:05.600
Don't we all?

38:05.668 --> 38:07.902
I'm gonna get your story one day, Charlie.

38:09.672 --> 38:10.971
Yeah.

38:11.039 --> 38:13.208
Well, it's not really my field, Thor.

38:13.275 --> 38:15.276
I'm just a lowly orthopod

38:15.311 --> 38:17.945
trying to look after my patients best I can.

38:18.013 --> 38:20.447
I talked to Alex, by the way.

38:21.416 --> 38:23.184
She remembered something about her N.D.E.

38:23.218 --> 38:25.920
She's blocking it, just like you are.

38:28.489 --> 38:30.691
See you on top of the mountain, Charlie.

38:40.901 --> 38:42.569
Oh.

38:42.604 --> 38:45.639
Dana, what you said to me
earlier was totally out of line.

38:45.673 --> 38:47.140
It was... it was outrageous.

38:47.174 --> 38:49.142
I was just trying
to help you and your daughter.

38:49.176 --> 38:51.377
[sighs] Apology accepted.

38:52.579 --> 38:54.814
Let's move on.

38:56.717 --> 38:58.885
Can you believe that?

39:00.154 --> 39:01.154
Come here.

39:01.222 --> 39:02.222
Why?

39:02.256 --> 39:03.556
You've had a bad day.

39:03.624 --> 39:05.725
I saw Dr. Kinney read you
like the riot act earlier.

39:05.759 --> 39:07.860
You look like you could use a-a hug.

39:07.894 --> 39:09.895
Okay.

39:10.731 --> 39:11.930
Why are you so stiff?

39:11.965 --> 39:13.866
Oh, my god. Apparently, I'm a bad hugger.

39:13.900 --> 39:15.668
You don't think I'm gonna
kiss you again, do you?

39:15.702 --> 39:17.002
<i>Are</i> you?

39:17.904 --> 39:19.705
Good night, Dr. Lin.

39:29.916 --> 39:31.583
Why didn't you tell me?

39:32.886 --> 39:34.787
[sniffles]

39:38.258 --> 39:41.459
How do I tell you about an abusive husband?

39:41.494 --> 39:44.929
About a man I had to get
a restraining order against.

39:47.300 --> 39:48.566
This is my fault.

39:48.601 --> 39:49.567
No.

39:49.602 --> 39:50.935
This is all my fault.

39:50.969 --> 39:52.003
You're wrong. It's not.

39:52.070 --> 39:53.672
[sniffles] I-I'm sorry.

39:53.706 --> 39:54.739
[sobbing] I'm so sorry.

39:54.774 --> 39:55.807
- I'm sorry.
- Listen to me.

39:55.874 --> 39:57.708
This is not your fault.

39:57.742 --> 39:59.877
[crying] I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

39:59.945 --> 40:01.712
[sobbing]

40:04.449 --> 40:06.017
The cops are here to talk to you, Dr. Goran.

40:06.051 --> 40:07.518
Oh, my god.

40:08.854 --> 40:10.621
[sobbing]

40:12.223 --> 40:14.725
[sniffles]

40:14.793 --> 40:17.928
I'll come back once I've spoken with them.

40:21.098 --> 40:22.333
Sir, we take it very seriously

40:22.367 --> 40:24.000
when someone leaves the scene of a crime.

40:24.035 --> 40:25.268
I was the one who was attacked.

40:25.337 --> 40:27.103
And he's the one who's dead.

40:27.171 --> 40:28.939
So, how well did you know the victim?

40:29.006 --> 40:30.841
I didn't. I only met him today.

40:32.143 --> 40:35.712
He was married to my colleague
at the street clinic.

40:35.779 --> 40:38.114
And you know that she has
a restraining order against him?

40:38.182 --> 40:41.218
And were you and this colleague
involved in a relationship?

40:43.554 --> 40:45.888
I'll take that as a "yes."

40:45.956 --> 40:47.490
Are we done here?

40:47.558 --> 40:49.359
Actually, we're not, sir.
You're gonna have to come with us.

40:49.426 --> 40:50.626
I'm not going anywhere, man.

40:50.694 --> 40:52.462
Listen, are we gonna have a problem here?

40:57.735 --> 40:58.668
Hey.

40:58.736 --> 40:59.902
I was looking for you.

40:59.970 --> 41:03.105
I've been wanting to talk to you, actually.

41:03.139 --> 41:05.341
I think I remembered something...

41:05.408 --> 41:06.876
uh, a dream, a hallucination?

41:06.943 --> 41:08.510
I don't know.

41:08.578 --> 41:11.947
I think I saw you after I was stabbed.

41:12.015 --> 41:13.782
Sorry to interrupt. It's Dr. Goran.

41:13.850 --> 41:15.384
He's been arrested.

41:15.418 --> 41:17.019
What?

41:19.889 --> 41:21.322
[gasps]

41:23.493 --> 41:25.293
She's gone.

41:27.630 --> 41:29.631
[voice breaking] She's gone.

41:29.699 --> 41:32.567
âª stop talking, talking âª
[crying]

41:32.602 --> 41:36.104
âª you're not listening, listening âª

41:36.171 --> 41:39.173
âª keep, keep breathing, breathing âª

41:39.241 --> 41:42.476
âª my fears unfold âª

41:42.511 --> 41:45.513
âª and I can't get back âª

41:45.547 --> 41:48.783
âª my body calm âª

41:48.850 --> 41:56.490
âª as the cold washed over me âª

42:14.008 --> 42:20.380
âª I was in a trance âª
âª when you whispered how âª

42:20.415 --> 42:24.684
âª the world had got to us âª

42:26.487 --> 42:32.124
âª so I started a war âª
âª that you couldn't shut out âª

42:32.159 --> 42:36.796
âª I started a war âª

42:39.533 --> 42:45.504
âª I was in a trance âª
âª when you whispered how âª

42:45.538 --> 42:51.877
âª the world had got to us âª

42:51.911 --> 42:58.717
âª so I started a, I started a war âª

42:58.751 --> 43:04.755
âª I started a war âª
âª that you couldn't shut out âª
