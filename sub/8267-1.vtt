00:47.397 --> 00:52.318
<i>Centuries ago,
during the dawn of the red moon...</i>

00:52.485 --> 00:56.573
<i>...our peaceful hamlet
was terrorised by a beast...</i>

00:59.033 --> 01:02.078
<i>...born not of man, but spewed forth...</i>

01:02.245 --> 01:06.374
<i>...from the fieriest pits of Hades...</i>

01:06.541 --> 01:11.838
<i>...with an evil fuelled by
a hatred of men and a love of women.</i>

01:12.005 --> 01:17.010
<i>Its name: Carmilla, the vampire queen.</i>

01:17.177 --> 01:20.263
<i>No one could defeat her, save one man:</i>

01:20.430 --> 01:25.935
<i>A baron away for decades
fighting in the Crusades.</i>

01:26.102 --> 01:29.564
<i>Upon his return, the baron found
that Carmilla's desires...</i>

01:29.731 --> 01:32.817
<i>...had ensnared his beautiful wife, Eva...</i>

01:32.984 --> 01:35.653
<i>...and turned her into a lover
of the vagine.</i>

01:35.820 --> 01:37.697
No!

01:40.033 --> 01:43.411
<i>Consumed with vengeance,
the baron pledged to destroy Carmilla...</i>

01:43.745 --> 01:45.330
<i>...and flee the village.</i>

01:46.623 --> 01:49.000
<i>He unearthed the sacred
Books of Nekros...</i>

01:49.167 --> 01:51.711
<i>...where he discovered
the only way of slaying...</i>

01:51.878 --> 01:56.257
<i>...this unholy harpy, once and for all,
was to forge a sacred sword...</i>

01:56.424 --> 02:00.720
<i>...a weapon blessed with
an ancient Babylonian hex...</i>

02:00.887 --> 02:04.015
<i>...and infused with his own blood.</i>

02:04.182 --> 02:08.353
<i>Without fear,
he confronted Carmilla.</i>

02:15.735 --> 02:19.447
<i>But before the baron
could strike the fatal blow...</i>

02:19.614 --> 02:22.992
<i>Carmilla laid down a curse most vile.</i>

02:23.159 --> 02:26.246
As you strike me down,
so you shall release evil...

02:26.413 --> 02:29.666
...within me into your daughters
and your daughters' daughters...

02:29.833 --> 02:33.795
...and they shall not rest
until your bloodline's ended.

02:33.962 --> 02:37.632
They will know your breed
by these marks above your heart.

02:37.799 --> 02:40.885
And when the life's blood
of the last of your line...

02:41.052 --> 02:43.179
...mixes with that of a virgin girl...

02:43.346 --> 02:48.436
I shall rise again, more powerful
than you will ever imagine.

02:49.602 --> 02:52.313
<i>And with that,
he lopped her fucking head off.</i>

02:56.568 --> 02:59.070
<i>Henceforth,
every woman in our village...</i>

02:59.237 --> 03:02.615
<i>...upon her 18th birthday,
is turned by the curse...</i>

03:02.782 --> 03:05.744
<i>...and reborn a lesbian vampire.</i>

03:05.910 --> 03:09.247
<i>Our only salvation is a prophecy
that foretells of the day...</i>

03:09.414 --> 03:12.041
<i>...when the last descendent
of the baron's bloodline...</i>

03:12.208 --> 03:15.754
<i>...shall return to this hamlet and vanquish
Carmilla's curse forever.</i>

03:17.881 --> 03:20.467
<i>That time... Has begun.</i>

03:20.633 --> 03:25.805
- I'm not happy, Jimmy.
- Why? What did I do wrong?

03:25.972 --> 03:28.975
Things are different now
to how they used to be.

03:29.142 --> 03:32.604
I just don't love you anymore.
No, I love you.

03:32.771 --> 03:36.274
I'm just not in love with you.

03:36.441 --> 03:40.570
- You know I'll always love you.
- You say that every time you dump me.

03:40.737 --> 03:43.740
I don't dump you, Jimmy.
I just take time out...

03:43.907 --> 03:46.701
...to re-evaluate the parameters
of our relationship.

03:46.868 --> 03:51.623
That's what makes us so strong together.

03:51.790 --> 03:55.043
If we're that strong together,
why are you dumping me... Again?

03:55.210 --> 03:59.214
I'm not dumping you. I just think
we're stronger together apart.

03:59.380 --> 04:01.674
That doesn't make
grammatical sense, so...

04:01.841 --> 04:06.137
Feel it with your heart,
and know what I'm saying is true.

04:06.304 --> 04:10.725
- So... You are dumping me?
- No.

04:10.892 --> 04:13.645
But, also in a sense, yes.

04:15.021 --> 04:17.023
- Yes!
- Shit.

04:21.778 --> 04:23.530
I'm not happy, Fletch.

04:23.696 --> 04:25.824
I'm trying my best, Miss Rossi.

04:25.990 --> 04:27.742
Your bestjust isn't good enough.

04:28.076 --> 04:30.787
- What more do you want me to do?
- I don't know.

04:30.954 --> 04:33.206
- This has to be the end of the line.
- What?

04:33.373 --> 04:36.501
- What did I do wrong?
- You punched him in the face.

04:36.668 --> 04:40.422
You know what I get like when people
mess with my shit. He had it coming.

04:40.588 --> 04:43.174
He was seven.
You're a children's clown.

04:43.341 --> 04:46.177
Old enough to know
not to go messing with my shit.

04:46.344 --> 04:47.804
Fletch, you punched a child.

04:48.012 --> 04:50.473
He was spraying me
with my own seltzer bottle.

04:50.640 --> 04:53.476
- What was I supposed to do?
- Not hit him.

04:53.643 --> 04:57.230
Then he shouldn't be spraying
my ball sac. It was only a tap.

04:57.397 --> 05:00.942
- You gave him a bloody nose!
- I look like I pissed myself!

05:01.109 --> 05:05.113
Christ, Fletch. I don't know
why you do these things.

05:06.823 --> 05:08.491
I guess I just don't like kids.

05:08.658 --> 05:11.870
I keep telling you,
they're a pre-requisite of the job.

05:12.036 --> 05:14.664
I know. A slight problem.

05:15.623 --> 05:18.126
Maybe I could just be
a clown for adults.

05:18.960 --> 05:23.089
- You're fired.
- Do I get to keep the costume?

05:23.256 --> 05:27.135
No. Drop your costume at the desk
on the way out. Goodbye, Fletch.

05:36.978 --> 05:39.397
- Do I get this week's money?
- Goodbye, Fletch.

05:39.564 --> 05:42.108
<i>I'm cryin'blood.</i>

05:42.442 --> 05:44.527
<i>I'm cryin'blood.</i>

05:44.694 --> 05:48.114
<i>I'm cryin' tears from my eyes
that I can't deny.</i>

05:48.281 --> 05:51.117
<i>And I'm fallin'like a comet
from the sky.</i>

05:51.284 --> 05:53.495
<i>I'm cryin'blood.</i>

05:53.661 --> 05:56.247
<i>I'm cryin'blood.</i>

05:56.414 --> 05:59.793
<i>I'm cryin' tears from my eyes
that I can't deny.</i>

05:59.959 --> 06:03.088
<i>And I'm fallin'like a comet
from the broken sky.</i>

06:03.254 --> 06:04.339
<i>Oh, how you.</i>

06:04.506 --> 06:05.632
<i>Oh, how you need me.</i>

06:05.799 --> 06:07.675
<i>Desperately.</i>

06:07.842 --> 06:09.094
<i>Desperately need me.</i>

06:09.260 --> 06:10.553
<i>Wish you could...</i>

06:10.720 --> 06:13.014
I've come up with a plan
for getting her back.

06:13.181 --> 06:14.724
What, like revenge?

06:14.891 --> 06:18.520
No, getting her back, not
"getting her back" getting her back.

06:18.686 --> 06:22.774
Getting her back.
Number one: Take her on holiday.

06:22.941 --> 06:25.318
Stop there.
That's just fucking stupid.

06:25.485 --> 06:28.363
- The two of us, on our own...
- On your own?

06:28.530 --> 06:31.825
Like when you went to Falaraki
and she dumped you and banged that...

06:31.991 --> 06:34.327
...water ski instructor
with highlights and necklace?

06:34.494 --> 06:37.497
She didn't dump me.
She told me she was just... Confused.

06:37.664 --> 06:40.333
Not that confused she couldn't
figure out where to put his cock.

06:40.500 --> 06:45.088
- That's my bird you're talking about.
- No. No, it isn't. Not anymore.

06:46.965 --> 06:50.427
Look, you need to get away
from all this shit.

06:50.593 --> 06:53.096
Let us have a wacky adventure,
you and me.

06:53.263 --> 06:56.599
I'm not gonna bum you, but I think
you could use a distraction.

06:56.766 --> 07:00.395
Say what you like, but you cannot
deny I am incredibly distracting.

07:00.562 --> 07:02.814
- Some might say annoying.
- And that...

07:04.023 --> 07:06.693
I don't know.
Where do you suggest we go?

07:08.027 --> 07:10.196
Ibiza.

07:11.281 --> 07:16.327
The sun, the sea, the sand,
clubs and fanny.

07:16.494 --> 07:22.083
Lots and lots of fanny.
Loads and loads of fanny.

07:22.250 --> 07:25.628
A gargantuan amount of "vajay".

07:25.795 --> 07:28.923
All wanting to shag you, Jimmy McLaren...

07:29.090 --> 07:33.887
...and if there's a few stragglers
who fancy a go on me, then so be it.

07:35.722 --> 07:37.265
I can't. I'm skint.

07:37.432 --> 07:40.101
What? I thought
you had loads saved up.

07:40.268 --> 07:42.395
Yeah... I lent it to Judy to buy a car.

07:42.562 --> 07:47.067
Oh, my God! Why don't you just get
"total twat" tattooed on your forehead?

07:47.233 --> 07:50.070
Can't you see what that witch
has done to our lives?

07:50.236 --> 07:54.532
Relied on that money for my holiday.
Our holiday, I mean.

07:54.699 --> 07:58.078
- How much have you got?
- Um...

07:58.244 --> 08:00.163
Uh, well...

08:00.330 --> 08:02.957
Tricky, because
I've sort of been sacked.

08:03.124 --> 08:05.001
- You hit another girl?
- It was a boy.

08:05.168 --> 08:06.711
I don't want to talk about it.

08:06.878 --> 08:11.549
So what we're essentially saying is that
neither of us can afford to go anywhere.

08:11.716 --> 08:13.009
- Pretty much.
- Brilliant.

08:33.863 --> 08:36.825
Uh, hello. Wasn't expecting you.

08:36.991 --> 08:39.785
- I've finally done it!
- Done what?

08:39.953 --> 08:43.957
Get the "champers" on ice.
I'm all yours, honey.

08:44.124 --> 08:48.461
- Oh, bloody hell.
- I've left him for good this time...

08:48.628 --> 08:51.840
...so you and me can have fun.

08:52.006 --> 08:54.509
You've done what?

08:54.676 --> 08:57.762
Let's celebrate. Naughty boy!

09:01.599 --> 09:03.518
Who the hell are you?

09:04.853 --> 09:08.064
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm his girlfriend.

09:08.231 --> 09:13.862
Really? I'm his wife.

09:14.028 --> 09:16.573
Right.

09:21.661 --> 09:23.580
- Dave, get back here!
- In my defence...

09:23.747 --> 09:26.374
I never meant for you to find out.

09:34.841 --> 09:38.762
- I got a plan.
- Does it involve girls?

09:38.928 --> 09:42.432
- It's cheap.
- Yeah. Does it involve girls?

09:42.599 --> 09:46.186
Let's... Go... Hiking.

09:49.773 --> 09:53.234
That... is one of the most
depressingly shitty...

09:53.401 --> 09:56.696
...ideas for a holiday
I've ever heard in my life, ever.

09:56.863 --> 10:00.742
- It's a great idea.
- You're a penis!

10:02.452 --> 10:05.705
Wherever it lands on the map,
we go there.

10:05.872 --> 10:07.916
Leave it to the hands of fate.

10:08.083 --> 10:09.334
- What do you say?
- No.

10:09.501 --> 10:11.795
- It'll be brilliant.
- It will be shit.

10:11.961 --> 10:13.755
Let the dart show us the way.

10:15.590 --> 10:17.217
All right, then. Fuck it.

10:17.383 --> 10:20.720
I'm only agreeing because
I'm feeling for you right now...

10:20.887 --> 10:24.766
...and because
I'm unbelievably shit-faced.

10:24.933 --> 10:27.977
Throw it like you mean it, McLaren.

10:47.330 --> 10:50.542
I never heard of it.
How do you say it? Crag...

10:50.708 --> 10:53.378
Cragwi... Cragwich?

10:53.545 --> 10:58.341
It's spelled A-D-V-N-T-U-R-E, my friend.

11:00.343 --> 11:02.679
Christ, you're a tit!

11:14.441 --> 11:18.111
Get that?

11:18.278 --> 11:20.822
Country air. Nothing like it.

11:20.989 --> 11:23.491
Smells like normal air
with cow shit in it.

11:23.658 --> 11:26.619
Exactly. Nothing like the
pervading stench of faeces...

11:26.786 --> 11:28.872
...to take your mind off your troubles.

11:31.374 --> 11:33.710
Have you brought anything besides beer?

11:39.549 --> 11:42.218
You're expecting a
water bomb fight or something?

11:52.896 --> 11:54.814
<i>- Hello?
- Jimmy, it's me.</i>

11:54.981 --> 11:57.400
- Judy?
- Yes! Look, Jimmy.

11:57.567 --> 12:01.112
I've been thinking, and I realise
I've made a terrible mistake.

12:01.279 --> 12:04.866
I want to come back, Jimmy.
I... Love you.

12:05.033 --> 12:06.785
- What?
- I love you!

12:06.951 --> 12:10.663
<i>Hello?</i>

12:10.830 --> 12:12.749
I can't hear... Hello?

12:12.916 --> 12:15.794
Judy?

12:15.960 --> 12:17.921
I'll drive to meet you.

12:18.088 --> 12:21.633
We can talk, the two of us.
We can work everything out.

12:21.800 --> 12:25.178
<i>When I get there,
you can wear my panties.</i>

12:35.230 --> 12:39.943
- Why'd you do that?
- We are here to hike.

12:40.110 --> 12:44.072
But... I can't fucking believe
you just done that!

12:44.239 --> 12:47.075
OK, maybe I did overreact
a bit, and I'm sorry.

12:47.242 --> 12:50.161
I'll, um, buy you another one. Jim...

12:50.328 --> 12:52.580
Jim!

13:01.589 --> 13:03.508
Hold up a minute.

13:12.851 --> 13:15.770
Can't we take a little rest?
I'm getting a stitch.

13:15.937 --> 13:19.107
We've only been walking
for three minutes.

13:19.274 --> 13:22.318
Yeah, but you're not walking.
You're virtually running.

13:22.485 --> 13:24.237
It's like you're in a mood with me.

13:24.404 --> 13:28.575
- I can't imagine why. Can you?
- You're getting a real attitude.

13:28.742 --> 13:30.827
- Oh, fuck off.
- No, you fuck off.

13:30.994 --> 13:33.496
I've dragged my arse
to some leafy shit-hole...

13:33.663 --> 13:37.333
I can't even pronounce, for you,
and look how ungrateful you're being.

13:37.500 --> 13:41.337
Ungrateful? You stamped on my phone
whilst Judy was trying to make up.

13:41.504 --> 13:43.381
What? Like the last seven times?

13:43.548 --> 13:46.801
You're a mental case holding out
for that serial dumper...

13:46.968 --> 13:50.680
...to have you back for the... Drum roll,
please... Eighth fucking time.

13:50.847 --> 13:53.266
That's why we're here
rather than somewhere...

13:53.433 --> 13:56.352
...it might be remotely possible
to engage a solitary woman...

13:56.519 --> 13:59.230
...in so much as a polite conversation.

14:01.191 --> 14:03.401
- There might be girls.
- Will there? Balls.

14:15.663 --> 14:17.040
<i>Woman.</i>

14:17.207 --> 14:18.875
<i>You know you, Woman.</i>

14:19.042 --> 14:20.710
<i>You got to be a Woman.</i>

14:20.877 --> 14:22.962
<i>I've got the feeling of love.</i>

14:23.129 --> 14:25.090
<i>When you're talking to me.</i>

14:25.256 --> 14:27.509
<i>You see right through me.</i>

14:27.675 --> 14:30.136
<i>I've got the feeling of love.</i>

14:30.303 --> 14:33.181
<i>She's a woman, you know what I mean.</i>

14:33.348 --> 14:36.726
<i>You better listen, listen to me.</i>

14:36.893 --> 14:39.813
<i>She's gonna set you free.</i>

14:39.979 --> 14:42.232
<i>Oh, oh, yeah.</i>

14:55.912 --> 15:00.083
What are the chances?

15:04.129 --> 15:06.089
Come on, Jim.
They came from there.

15:06.256 --> 15:09.843
- Yeah. So?
- "So"?

15:10.009 --> 15:13.012
Are you some kind of eunuch
or something?

15:13.179 --> 15:16.975
Not bad enough that woman's robbed you
of brains, but testicles and all.

15:17.142 --> 15:19.561
I'm sorry.
I'm claiming your testicles back.

15:19.728 --> 15:23.481
No... Not that I literally
want your test...

15:23.648 --> 15:27.068
That's just sick. Look.
They're just the beginning.

15:27.235 --> 15:29.946
These small, rural places
are renowned for breeding...

15:30.113 --> 15:33.533
...the crème de la crème of the
female form. It's the fresh air.

15:33.700 --> 15:37.328
They go a bundle for city boys like
you and me. Impressive we are, mate.

15:37.495 --> 15:40.749
I guarantee this place will be
wall to wall with rosy-cheeked...

15:40.915 --> 15:44.794
English country maidens,
like that lot, but even dirtier.

15:52.761 --> 15:55.889
It's like some sort of medieval gay bar.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.141
Don't sweat it.

15:59.601 --> 16:02.020
The womenfolk are all off
braiding their hair...

16:02.187 --> 16:05.148
...in some kind of naked fertility
ceremony or something.

16:05.315 --> 16:08.443
That village green will be full
of heaving tits by sundown.

16:08.610 --> 16:11.613
- These guys look weird.
- Just relax.

16:11.780 --> 16:14.491
They're just blokes, like you and I.

16:14.657 --> 16:17.577
They like a beer,
enjoy a scented candle.

16:17.744 --> 16:21.790
They're my kind of people.
I can relate. Stick with me.

16:28.713 --> 16:30.465
Good morrow.

16:30.632 --> 16:34.552
Two flagons of ale, please, sir.

16:38.723 --> 16:41.142
There you go.

16:41.309 --> 16:44.229
Compliments of the house, lads.

16:54.531 --> 16:56.533
Thank you.

17:11.089 --> 17:16.010
Keep it together, mate.
Keep it together.

17:16.176 --> 17:19.180
I'm just a bit worried
I'm going to get raped.

17:24.519 --> 17:27.396
So how many more, Tom?
How many more?

17:27.564 --> 17:30.400
Don't you be all high and mighty
with me, vicar.

17:30.567 --> 17:32.777
We have to stop this madness.

17:32.944 --> 17:36.489
- Reckon that's his daughter?
- If it's not, that's one dirty vicar.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.616
We can't let more
innocent people die!

17:38.783 --> 17:42.287
- Then what? Then they'll come for us!
- Oh. Hi.

17:42.454 --> 17:46.499
Don't you see they have us already?
Our women are cursed...

17:46.666 --> 17:49.294
...and we are spineless fools
who let it happen.

17:49.461 --> 17:53.047
I know it's hard, vicar, what with
your Rebecca turning 18...

17:53.214 --> 17:54.299
Eighteen? Love it.

17:54.466 --> 18:00.096
Together we can stop this.
You are either with me or against me.

18:00.263 --> 18:01.723
What a tosser.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.309
Who is with me?

18:09.814 --> 18:11.274
No, it can't be.

18:12.567 --> 18:13.985
No, that's impossible.

18:15.445 --> 18:19.199
- It can't be you. What is your name?
- Hey, this cost 25 quid, mate!

18:19.365 --> 18:22.994
- That is enough, Father. Enough!
- Daddy!

18:23.161 --> 18:25.330
Come, child.

18:31.294 --> 18:35.590
Does he know you? Have you been
hanging out with vicars?

18:35.757 --> 18:39.552
- Never seen him before in my life.
- Sorry about that, lads.

18:39.719 --> 18:43.306
Here you go.
No hard feelings, eh?

18:43.473 --> 18:47.519
Sorry for the vicar.
He's a strange sort.

18:47.685 --> 18:51.773
If you lads want a bed for the night...

18:51.940 --> 18:54.442
...there be a cottage,
the old Mircalla place...

18:54.609 --> 18:56.528
...not two miles down the road.

18:57.779 --> 18:59.989
Oh, that's great, but how much is it?

19:00.156 --> 19:02.367
- We're a bit light on the old...
- Money.

19:02.534 --> 19:06.079
Oh, it don't cost nothing.
The doors are always open.

19:06.246 --> 19:12.001
Any weary traveller
can expect a nice, long rest.

19:12.168 --> 19:16.714
You, sir, are a scholar and a gent.

19:16.881 --> 19:20.385
If there's one thing I like more
than free booze, it's a free bed.

19:20.552 --> 19:21.803
Thank you very much.

19:21.970 --> 19:24.556
Might be a bit
of a tight squeeze, though.

19:24.723 --> 19:29.102
I sent some beautiful young girls
down there not too long ago.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.576
<i>Take off your clothes
Come on, take 'em off.</i>

19:44.743 --> 19:47.412
<i>I like you so much better
when you're naked.</i>

19:47.579 --> 19:50.206
<i>I like me so much better
when you're naked.</i>

19:50.373 --> 19:53.543
<i>I like you so much better
when you're naked.</i>

19:56.212 --> 20:00.967
<i>I like you so much...</i>

20:01.134 --> 20:02.635
What's wrong with it?

20:02.802 --> 20:06.639
Come on, come on.
Don't break down on us now. Come on!

20:06.806 --> 20:09.809
Come on! What?

20:21.446 --> 20:24.199
- Come on!
- That'll really help, Lotte.

20:24.365 --> 20:26.993
<i>- We're screwed.
- Ja.</i>

20:27.160 --> 20:31.414
Great. We're in the middle of nowhere,
miles from anywhere.

20:31.581 --> 20:33.708
Are you sure you put petrol in?

20:33.875 --> 20:37.170
- Anke, for the fifth time, yes.
- Just checking.

20:37.337 --> 20:40.173
Well, let us walk to the cottage.
We must be close.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.093
The landlord said
it was only a few miles.

20:43.259 --> 20:46.012
<i>- Ja.
- We're closer to the inn.</i>

20:46.179 --> 20:47.889
We should go get help.

20:49.391 --> 20:52.018
<i>Ja. Ja.</i>

20:53.311 --> 20:57.273
I'm only going back there with knives.
Those men were freaky.

20:58.191 --> 21:00.819
<i>- I think we should stay with the van.
- Ja.</i>

21:00.985 --> 21:04.447
Oh...

21:10.453 --> 21:12.372
Do you hear that?

21:12.539 --> 21:15.125
What is it?

21:16.084 --> 21:18.545
There's something out there.

21:18.711 --> 21:21.089
<i>- Stop scaring us, Lotte.
- Ja.</i>

21:21.256 --> 21:24.134
Listen, listen!

21:27.011 --> 21:29.013
It's coming from the roof!

21:30.932 --> 21:33.476
- It is probably just a branch.
- A branch?

21:33.643 --> 21:34.686
<i>Ja.</i>

21:51.870 --> 21:54.831
I told you!

22:01.087 --> 22:03.882
- Evening, ladies.
- Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

22:04.048 --> 22:05.967
Excuse us.
Our van just broke down...

22:06.134 --> 22:09.929
- And we were a little bit spooked.
- Seems OK now.

22:10.096 --> 22:13.391
Anyhow, hi, I'm Lotte.

22:13.558 --> 22:16.269
This is Anke, Heidi and Trudi.

22:16.436 --> 22:21.274
Hello, Lotte, Andy, Eric. Hello, girls.

22:22.609 --> 22:25.445
<i>- Beer?
- Oh,ja!</i>

22:25.612 --> 22:26.821
<i>Ja, ja, ja!</i>

22:27.739 --> 22:29.574
You're my type of girl.

22:33.244 --> 22:34.496
The name's Fletch.

22:37.165 --> 22:39.626
- What's your name?
- That's my man, Jimmy.

22:39.793 --> 22:42.420
He's had his heart broken. It's tragic.

22:42.587 --> 22:45.465
- Oh!
- It's just tragic. Really is.

22:45.632 --> 22:48.760
- Hello, Jimmy.
- All right.

22:48.927 --> 22:53.973
So, what are four lovely ladies like
you doing here on a night like this?

22:54.140 --> 22:56.559
We're on our way
to the Mircalla cottage.

23:00.063 --> 23:02.357
There's an uncanny stroke of luck!

23:02.524 --> 23:07.112
These girls are all going to the exact
same cottage that we are.

23:09.823 --> 23:12.951
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

23:13.118 --> 23:15.203
Great.

23:15.370 --> 23:18.706
- Do you want to ride with us?
- Thanks. That's very nice of you.

23:18.873 --> 23:20.708
- Oh, yeah!
- Take a seat.

23:20.875 --> 23:22.794
When in Rome.

23:22.961 --> 23:27.632
- Be careful. You know what happens.
- Relax. It's fine.

23:32.220 --> 23:34.931
OK, let's go.

23:46.067 --> 23:49.487
A couple of young fellows
were in here not an hour ago.

23:49.654 --> 23:53.366
Directed them towards the cottage
not a couple of miles down the road.

23:53.533 --> 23:55.994
What? Just carry on down the road?

23:56.161 --> 24:01.040
There you go, miss. Carry straight
on down, and you can't fail to see it.

24:02.417 --> 24:04.335
Now, she was a pretty one.

24:04.502 --> 24:07.964
They always are, Sidney.

24:08.131 --> 24:13.345
Sirens. Cold, bewitching demons,
every last one of them.

24:17.265 --> 24:18.975
Pint, Jack?

24:46.503 --> 24:50.757
- Wow. This place is amazing!
- Oh, I love it!

24:50.924 --> 24:53.718
- Oh, cool!
- They got beers!

24:53.885 --> 24:56.346
Can we actually move here?

24:56.513 --> 24:58.014
- Yes!
- Yes, let's move in!

25:10.777 --> 25:13.446
<i>Let's party!</i>

25:13.613 --> 25:16.783
- We need Schnapps!
- Rack 'em up! Rack 'em up!

25:16.950 --> 25:19.661
All right! Yes!

25:19.828 --> 25:22.956
J man, bottoms up!

25:23.123 --> 25:25.708
- Bottoms up!
- Cocks in.

25:26.709 --> 25:30.088
- Oh, yummy!
- Let's dance!

25:30.255 --> 25:32.006
Oh!

25:34.968 --> 25:37.512
<i>Feelin'hot, hot, hot.</i>

25:39.055 --> 25:40.849
<i>Feelin'hot, hot, hot.</i>

25:54.028 --> 25:57.699
This might be the best night
of my entire fucking life!

26:00.034 --> 26:03.705
Room for the Fletchmeister? Yes? Yes?

26:07.417 --> 26:09.794
<i>Let me rum bum bum bum.</i>

26:11.337 --> 26:13.631
<i>Let me rum bum bum bum.</i>

26:14.090 --> 26:15.717
I love hiking!

26:15.884 --> 26:19.721
<i>Olé, olé, olé, olé.</i>

26:19.888 --> 26:23.183
<i>Olé, olé, olé, olé.</i>

26:23.349 --> 26:25.685
<i>Let me rum bum bum bum...</i>

26:27.395 --> 26:29.898
<i>- Let me rum bum bum bum.
- Take your clothes off!</i>

26:30.065 --> 26:33.526
<i>- Take your clothes off!
- Feelin'hot, hot, hot.</i>

26:35.278 --> 26:37.822
<i>Feelin'hot, hot, hot.</i>

26:39.866 --> 26:42.535
Do you know of Carmilla?

26:42.702 --> 26:47.749
- Uh, no. Is that who it is?
- Yes.

26:47.916 --> 26:51.377
- Carmilla. She's why we're all here.
- Eh?

26:51.544 --> 26:56.132
We're students of folklore and ancient
superstition. We're on a field trip.

26:56.299 --> 26:59.886
This village is home to the legend
of Carmilla, the vampire queen.

27:00.053 --> 27:02.472
- Vampire queen?
- According to legend...

27:02.639 --> 27:05.767
...she's much, much more than
just your average vampire queen.

27:05.934 --> 27:07.894
Some say she's 2,000 years old.

27:08.061 --> 27:10.605
<i>You believe in that
Dungeons & Dragons rubbish?</i>

27:10.772 --> 27:13.650
Where I grew up,
we're very superstitious.

27:13.817 --> 27:16.778
Cragwich is particularly
fascinating to me.

27:16.945 --> 27:19.614
The book of folklore tells
the story of this village...

27:19.781 --> 27:22.158
...and what Carmilla did to it
and its daughters.

27:22.325 --> 27:25.453
Even the bravest man shrinks in fear,
and the bravest woman...

27:25.620 --> 27:28.665
quivers with desire
at the mere mention of her name.

27:29.541 --> 27:31.251
Carmilla, the vampire queen.

27:37.132 --> 27:39.426
<i>Saturday, Saturday.</i>

27:39.592 --> 27:41.761
<i>- Hey! Jimmy Peon!
- Saturday night.</i>

27:41.928 --> 27:45.306
Come on. Get a beer. Get involved.

27:46.349 --> 27:48.476
It is your turn to go
with the larger one.

27:48.643 --> 27:50.270
<i>Saturday night.
Saturday night.</i>

27:50.437 --> 27:53.815
- Too many beers. I need a piss.
- The bog's outside.

27:53.982 --> 27:56.484
What? It's... It's dark out there.

27:56.651 --> 28:00.238
Heidi, are you afraid
Carmilla will get you?

28:00.405 --> 28:04.576
- Anke, don't be mean.
- OK, OK, I'm sorry.

28:04.743 --> 28:08.913
- Don't worry. I will go with her.
- Stop it!

28:09.998 --> 28:14.502
<i>- Saturday night.
- Watch this. Here come the beers.</i>

28:14.669 --> 28:18.048
<i>- Here come the beers. Ja?
- Ooh,ja!</i>

28:18.214 --> 28:20.633
He's a weird guy, Fletch, eh?

28:23.136 --> 28:25.096
She's pretending to bum me.

28:25.263 --> 28:27.932
Oh, his heart's in the right place.

28:28.099 --> 28:31.436
It's just a shame
his brain's in his dick.

28:38.193 --> 28:42.280
- Think his ying yang is big?
- Ying yang?

28:54.250 --> 28:59.130
<i>I like you so much better
when you're naked.</i>

28:59.297 --> 29:03.635
<i>I like you so much
better when you're naked.</i>

29:13.061 --> 29:15.480
All right. Which one do you want, then?

29:16.689 --> 29:20.026
Haven't thought about it.

29:20.193 --> 29:22.570
Oh! You are such a fucking ponce, James.

29:22.737 --> 29:26.157
Which one do you fancy?
Which one do you like the most?

29:26.324 --> 29:29.577
- Just answer the question.
- All right, then. Lotte.

29:29.744 --> 29:33.331
- She seems really nice and friendly.
- Mm-hmm.

29:33.498 --> 29:37.669
And it's like
she's got this pure spirit.

29:37.836 --> 29:42.757
She's just really sweet.
She's got the prettiest eyes.

29:42.924 --> 29:45.969
It's like looking into bottomless pools.

29:47.470 --> 29:49.347
- And you?
- Trudi.

29:49.514 --> 29:52.058
Massive tits, never speaks.

29:56.646 --> 29:59.524
Yeah, Trudi, you stink.

30:00.567 --> 30:02.610
<i>Ja. Ja.</i>

30:02.777 --> 30:05.864
<i>Oh,ja.</i>

30:10.493 --> 30:12.328
Hurry up!

30:19.461 --> 30:21.212
Anke.

30:27.761 --> 30:31.347
Anke?

30:31.514 --> 30:35.435
- Anke, stop it. It isn't funny.
- Heidi.

30:39.230 --> 30:41.107
Fuck!

30:41.941 --> 30:44.652
Anke, answer me now. It's not funny.

30:49.699 --> 30:51.868
Anke!

31:01.044 --> 31:03.129
Anke?

31:09.594 --> 31:13.431
Anke? Anke!

31:16.434 --> 31:18.395
Why are they taking so long?

31:18.561 --> 31:20.980
She's probably just having
a massive shit.

31:34.869 --> 31:37.122
Trudi.

31:38.790 --> 31:41.668
Trudi.

31:45.880 --> 31:49.384
Trudi.

31:52.595 --> 31:57.559
Trudi.

32:42.228 --> 32:44.439
Quickly!

32:48.359 --> 32:51.362
Trudi! We've got to get in there!

32:51.529 --> 32:53.782
OK. Stand back.

32:57.118 --> 32:59.996
Christ. That thing is rock-solid.

33:02.832 --> 33:05.126
- I must have weakened it.
- Yeah, right.

33:12.675 --> 33:15.720
- Look.
- Blood.

33:17.138 --> 33:18.807
Come.

33:22.977 --> 33:24.854
What was that?

33:25.021 --> 33:27.982
I don't know, but let's go find out.

33:29.025 --> 33:32.028
- Is she serious?
- We have to do something, don't we?

33:32.195 --> 33:35.949
This is all getting a bit weird: Women
missing, towels covered in blood.

33:36.116 --> 33:39.244
- It's more of a light spotting.
- Oh, that's all right, then.

33:39.411 --> 33:41.955
We heard her in here,
and now she's nowhere.

33:42.122 --> 33:45.750
- That is very fucking weird.
- Agreed, but we have to find Trudi.

33:45.917 --> 33:48.294
- You like Trudi, don't you?
- Not that much.

33:49.796 --> 33:51.881
That's just weak, man.

33:53.091 --> 33:54.759
For Christ's sake.

34:10.775 --> 34:14.070
Oh, God!

34:14.237 --> 34:16.239
For God's sake!

34:21.870 --> 34:25.248
I only got it seen to last week.

34:25.415 --> 34:27.667
Oh, my... Oh, come on!

34:27.833 --> 34:30.670
Shit!

34:40.472 --> 34:43.683
<i>Hi. You're through to Jimmy.
Please leave a message.</i>

34:43.850 --> 34:47.896
You are so dead, Jimmy!

34:48.063 --> 34:49.813
Judy.

34:49.981 --> 34:55.360
Judy. Judy.

34:55.527 --> 34:57.947
Anke!

34:58.114 --> 35:02.786
Heidi? Trudi?

35:05.288 --> 35:07.457
- Anything?
- No.

35:10.710 --> 35:13.296
Ah, well. Looks like she's gone.

35:15.006 --> 35:18.343
Head back inside, eh? Cup of tea?

35:19.302 --> 35:21.930
- Told you there was no one out here.
- Trudi?

35:22.263 --> 35:24.974
Probably just gone for a walk
or... Something.

35:25.141 --> 35:27.560
Let's head inside.
I've still got some beers.

35:27.727 --> 35:30.563
Oh, shit!

35:31.773 --> 35:33.733
Lotte.

35:33.900 --> 35:36.236
- It's over there.
- I heard it too.

35:37.862 --> 35:40.782
Look. I know something really wrong
is happening here...

35:41.116 --> 35:43.535
...but is there any chance
we can just ignore it?

35:43.701 --> 35:45.912
Fletch! Come on!

36:40.425 --> 36:43.887
It's impossible. It cannot be. Vampires.

36:44.054 --> 36:46.723
- Vampires?
- Vampires?

36:47.932 --> 36:50.310
Lesbian vampires.

36:50.477 --> 36:53.104
Nice one.

37:02.822 --> 37:05.909
Fucking hell, she's strong.

37:08.536 --> 37:10.038
Jimmy!

37:10.205 --> 37:13.541
- Shit.
- Jimmy!

37:24.010 --> 37:28.098
She's not so strong now.

37:50.161 --> 37:52.372
Ah! Rank!

38:01.214 --> 38:05.343
Is that it?

38:05.510 --> 38:08.179
No explosion or...

38:08.346 --> 38:12.058
...turning into burning ash or...
Nothing, no?

38:14.477 --> 38:16.312
Frankly, I'm a bit disappointed.

38:16.479 --> 38:19.607
I'm just glad she's dead.
I can hold out for fireworks.

38:19.774 --> 38:22.986
The legends... They're true.

38:23.153 --> 38:24.446
This is madness.

38:24.612 --> 38:27.574
- What's become of my friends?
- Lotte.

38:27.741 --> 38:28.867
Oh, crap.

38:29.993 --> 38:33.872
- Join us.
- Join us.

38:34.038 --> 38:36.416
<i>Ja.</i>

38:36.583 --> 38:40.462
I think they want you to say something.

38:40.628 --> 38:42.756
Never.

38:43.965 --> 38:45.550
Don't think they wanted you to say that.

38:45.717 --> 38:47.886
Fuck this! Run, you bellends!

38:57.645 --> 39:00.190
Come on, you silly fuckers!

39:02.567 --> 39:05.737
Now you will join us.

39:08.239 --> 39:09.866
Hmm.

39:10.033 --> 39:12.994
Get in.

39:17.165 --> 39:19.250
Oh, my God! Did you see that?

39:19.417 --> 39:23.046
That might be the coolest thing
I've done in my entire fucking life.

39:23.213 --> 39:25.965
I've always been good at cricket.
Maybe it's my guns.

39:26.132 --> 39:28.718
- Fletch, please shut up.
- Sorry, I'm just nervous.

39:28.885 --> 39:31.221
They'd have eaten us alive.
This is fucked up!

39:31.388 --> 39:33.932
Where did they go?

39:34.099 --> 39:39.104
Before sunrise,
you will all belong to us.

39:41.564 --> 39:44.150
Shit, shit, shit, shit.
What are we going to do?

39:44.317 --> 39:47.862
- We're going to die horribly.
- For Christ sake. You're not helping.

39:48.029 --> 39:51.199
- Calm down. Have a beer.
- We need to get out of here!

39:51.366 --> 39:54.786
- Come up with a plan then, Einstein.
- Hold on. The van.

39:54.953 --> 39:56.996
The van. Good plan. Great plan.

39:57.163 --> 39:58.998
Genius.

39:59.165 --> 40:01.334
I don't even want to know.

40:01.501 --> 40:04.003
What are we going to do now?

40:06.673 --> 40:09.008
Stakes. Lots of sharp stakes.

40:10.051 --> 40:13.972
Arm ourselves with anything we can
plunge through their hearts.

40:14.139 --> 40:15.849
Again, great idea. Like it.

40:16.015 --> 40:20.228
Plunging sharp objects. Hell-whore
hearts. Let's fucking have it.

40:25.775 --> 40:28.570
<i>Saturday night, I feel...</i>

40:31.614 --> 40:34.701
- Jimmy!
- Judy?

40:34.868 --> 40:39.205
What? Don't open
the fucking door! Jesus!

40:40.498 --> 40:43.626
- Judy, get in, quick.
- Oh, my God!

40:43.793 --> 40:46.463
- What the hell is going on?
- What are you doing here?

40:46.629 --> 40:49.966
- Something was chasing me.
- Vampires.

40:50.133 --> 40:54.220
- What?
- Yep. Lesbian vampires.

40:54.387 --> 40:56.806
- How ridiculous.
- No.

40:56.973 --> 41:00.101
Just another of God's cruel tricks
to get on my tits.

41:00.268 --> 41:03.980
Even dead women would sooner sleep
with each other than get with me.

41:04.147 --> 41:07.650
- But eating me alive? Oh, that's fine.
- Lesbian vampires?

41:07.817 --> 41:11.571
Next time he'll have me bummed
by a big gay werewolf, I swear.

41:11.738 --> 41:13.281
Come on. We need to lie down.

41:19.245 --> 41:22.749
- Who's that?
- Oh, it's Jimmy's ex.

41:22.916 --> 41:25.668
She keeps breaking up with him,
getting him back...

41:25.835 --> 41:28.546
...breaking up with him,
getting him back, you know?

41:32.008 --> 41:34.469
- I hate her.
- Me too.

41:34.636 --> 41:37.680
Man, this pisses me off.

41:37.847 --> 41:40.725
I've been saving myself
for the right man...

41:40.892 --> 41:43.311
...someone I can really have feelings for.

41:43.478 --> 41:47.107
- I finally meet him, and...
- What, you like Jimmy?

41:47.273 --> 41:49.776
Yes, I do.
But between her and the vampires...

41:49.943 --> 41:52.529
I'll probably die a virgin tonight.

41:57.575 --> 42:00.995
You're a virgin?

42:01.162 --> 42:05.208
Um, yeah.

42:24.436 --> 42:27.063
Oh, for God's sake, girl.
Cover yourself up.

42:28.356 --> 42:30.483
Daddy, I'm not a child any more.

42:30.650 --> 42:33.653
- Don't try me, girl.
- Oh!

42:50.795 --> 42:55.052
Jimmy, I know you have
every right to hate me...

42:57.218 --> 42:59.512
...but I just want you to know...

42:59.679 --> 43:03.933
...that I'm so happy
you let me through the door.

43:04.100 --> 43:06.686
Well, I don't hate you.
Well, not completely.

43:06.853 --> 43:09.981
I just don't know what
I keep doing you don't like.

43:10.148 --> 43:13.651
It's not you, Jimmy. It's me.

43:14.569 --> 43:17.697
I'm glad you realise that,
because if this is gonna work...

43:17.864 --> 43:21.493
- You're gonna have to change.
- Oh, I've changed.

43:21.659 --> 43:23.870
But how... How do I know that?

43:24.037 --> 43:27.707
How can I trust you? You're gonna
have to show me you're different.

43:27.874 --> 43:30.585
Oh, I'm different.

43:34.422 --> 43:40.011
Give me one... Last... Kiss.

43:46.559 --> 43:47.894
Huh?

44:47.954 --> 44:52.042
Probably best you remember her
the way she was, mate.

44:52.208 --> 44:56.129
A complete fucking bitch. Aah.

45:01.259 --> 45:03.595
Mate, thanks for saving my life.

45:03.762 --> 45:06.723
Hey, you know me, fella.

45:06.890 --> 45:11.227
I got your back.
Always have, always will.

45:12.645 --> 45:14.564
- Right, got 'em.
- What are you doing?

45:14.731 --> 45:17.984
- What do you think?
- What, Lotte was gonna...

45:18.151 --> 45:20.820
You know what they say
about extreme situations.

45:20.987 --> 45:25.200
And this, as I keep pointing out, my
friend, is an extreme fucking situation.

45:25.366 --> 45:28.536
- Bit seedy, isn't it?
- She's worried she'll die a virgin...

45:28.703 --> 45:31.831
...and frankly, I'm willing to take
any opportunity I can get.

45:31.998 --> 45:35.001
Emotional vulnerability, fear of
imminent death, vampire attacks.

45:35.168 --> 45:38.296
Screw it. I don't give a shit. Hi.

45:39.381 --> 45:42.258
How are you doing?

45:42.425 --> 45:45.970
- What happened?
- Oh, God. Um...

45:46.137 --> 45:50.308
As I suspected...

45:50.475 --> 45:54.646
- Judy was a vampire.
- We killed her.

45:54.813 --> 45:56.731
Fantastic.

46:09.285 --> 46:11.996
- Um, I'm going for a piss.
- What, outside?

46:12.163 --> 46:14.541
Do I look like a twat?

46:29.639 --> 46:33.393
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, gosh!

46:33.560 --> 46:35.228
Oh, God! Oh, God!

46:35.395 --> 46:37.772
Why aren't they coming in?
Judy walked in.

46:37.939 --> 46:41.067
No, they have to be invited in.
You invited Judy in.

46:41.234 --> 46:43.361
Oh.

46:45.655 --> 46:50.076
So all we have to do
is sit tight till morning.

46:50.243 --> 46:52.454
I mean, It's not like I'm gonna say...

46:52.620 --> 46:56.458
"Hey, lesbian vampires,
come into my cottage", is it? Oh, shit!

47:02.547 --> 47:05.925
Under full-on lesbian vampire attack?

47:06.092 --> 47:08.928
Still got it, fella.

47:10.096 --> 47:13.308
Look, I was being ironic.

47:13.475 --> 47:15.810
Guys?

47:24.944 --> 47:27.030
McLaren.

47:27.197 --> 47:29.991
- She knows my name.
- That's not a good sign.

47:30.158 --> 47:34.954
She is pure.

47:39.250 --> 47:41.294
Fletch!

47:48.176 --> 47:50.845
When in Rome...

47:58.770 --> 48:01.564
- Get away from him.
- Fuck off!

48:26.798 --> 48:30.468
- Nice.
- Get her into the shower.

48:30.635 --> 48:33.388
Quick! Quick!

48:33.555 --> 48:35.223
Quick! Turn it on!

48:38.893 --> 48:42.689
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

48:42.856 --> 48:45.525
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done on earth...

48:45.692 --> 48:49.779
Give us this day... Push her back!
She must stay underwater.

48:49.946 --> 48:52.657
Push her back!
Push her back under.

48:52.824 --> 48:57.287
- Oh, God!
- Keep her under! Don't let her go!

48:57.454 --> 49:01.583
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil...

49:01.750 --> 49:04.461
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us...

49:04.627 --> 49:07.297
- Fuck off!
- Keep going.

49:07.464 --> 49:11.634
Fucking hell!

49:11.801 --> 49:14.262
For Thine is the kingdom.
Jesus compels you!

49:14.429 --> 49:17.557
Oh, God, I love Jesus!
I love you, Jesus.

49:17.724 --> 49:22.353
- And the glory forever.
- All things bright and beautiful!

49:22.520 --> 49:24.814
Forever and ever.

49:28.902 --> 49:30.612
Amen.

49:31.571 --> 49:34.199
What the fuck?

49:34.365 --> 49:37.494
We need to go quickly.
Your friends have already been taken.

49:37.660 --> 49:40.163
- Ah, shite.
- There's no time to waste. Let's go!

49:40.330 --> 49:43.208
Hang on. How did you know
all this was happening?

49:43.375 --> 49:45.877
You and your friends
were sent as sacrifices.

49:46.044 --> 49:50.131
It's an age-old deal,
where the villagers supply fresh blood.

49:50.298 --> 49:53.051
In return, they get to keep
their cowardly hides.

49:53.218 --> 49:57.180
So we were just a light buffet
for a bunch of hot dykes?

49:57.347 --> 50:01.684
To my shame, yes. Your friend's
arrival in our hamlet is no coincidence.

50:01.851 --> 50:05.230
It's divine intervention
fulfilling a primordial prophecy.

50:05.397 --> 50:08.525
- Balls!
- Does he bear a birthmark?

50:08.691 --> 50:11.194
- Five red scratches around here?
- Yeah.

50:11.361 --> 50:14.364
His bloodline is the key
to the resurrection...

50:14.531 --> 50:19.160
...of the purest evil known to mankind:
Carmilla, the vampire queen.

50:19.327 --> 50:21.121
Eh?

50:21.287 --> 50:23.873
Paradoxically, the only thing
that can lift this village...

50:24.040 --> 50:26.668
...from a centuries-old curse
that turns every woman...

50:26.835 --> 50:29.879
...on her 18th birthday into a vampire.

50:30.046 --> 50:34.175
My daughter, Rebecca,
becomes 18 within hours.

50:34.342 --> 50:37.470
Right. Look,
I know you mean well. I really do.

50:37.637 --> 50:40.265
And I love the vibe.
You look amazing. But...

50:40.432 --> 50:45.562
I've seen weird shit, and even under
these circumstances this is a stretch.

50:45.729 --> 50:48.815
Jimmy's not the Messiah.
He can barely wipe his own arse.

50:48.982 --> 50:52.277
I understand your confusion.
Let's be on our way.

50:52.444 --> 50:55.113
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, Daddy-o. Go where?

50:55.280 --> 50:58.658
- Back to the village. No time to waste.
- Fuck that noise.

50:58.825 --> 51:01.161
- I'm sorry?
- I'm not going back out there.

51:01.327 --> 51:05.081
I've nearly been eaten three times
by the hottest women I've ever met.

51:05.248 --> 51:07.000
Starting to become a bind.

51:07.167 --> 51:11.254
But it's not too late to save your
friends, this village, the entire world!

51:11.421 --> 51:13.923
Yeah, well, you know,
best of luck with it.

51:14.090 --> 51:18.136
- I hope you get on all right.
- Are you fucking with me?

51:18.303 --> 51:21.639
- Are you allowed to swear?
- Shut up.

51:21.806 --> 51:25.685
You telling me you'd let eternal
darkness sweep over this entire planet...

51:25.852 --> 51:28.772
...and leave your friends to die?
Your friends?

51:28.938 --> 51:32.358
Well, I only really know Jimmy.
I just met the girl tonight. So...

51:32.525 --> 51:36.571
OK. Stay here and die.

51:41.284 --> 51:43.078
Oh...

51:46.873 --> 51:48.792
What's with all the scratches?

51:48.958 --> 51:51.127
The cruciform.
It drives the beasts away.

51:53.046 --> 51:56.174
- It looks shit.
- Just get in.

51:57.217 --> 52:01.096
OK, scratch master.
Where the fuck are we going?

52:01.262 --> 52:03.556
The tomb of your friend's
great ancestor.

52:35.463 --> 52:38.258
Fletch!

52:45.223 --> 52:49.018
Sisters...

52:49.185 --> 52:54.399
...a moment that has infested
our dreams and our desires...

52:54.566 --> 52:57.902
...for what seems like an eternity...

52:58.069 --> 53:01.573
...is finally upon us.

53:10.832 --> 53:13.460
For this night...

53:13.626 --> 53:18.381
...the last of the
McLaren clan shall fall...

53:18.548 --> 53:23.178
...and our queen shall rise again.

53:23.344 --> 53:26.848
- Carmilla?
- The vampire queen?

53:28.975 --> 53:31.269
Sorry. Carry on.

53:33.438 --> 53:36.691
So his blood mixed with
my virgin blood brings her back?

53:36.858 --> 53:39.402
You know a lot, pretty one.

53:39.569 --> 53:42.947
I've heard of Carmilla,
but never have I heard of you.

53:43.114 --> 53:46.367
Obviously you're not evil enough
to even make the history books.

53:53.124 --> 53:55.168
Well...

53:55.335 --> 54:00.006
...soon she will know of you.

54:01.591 --> 54:07.222
And with her resurrection,
this land will be ensnared forever...

54:07.389 --> 54:11.059
...in the dawn of the red moon.

54:17.649 --> 54:21.444
McLaren, these are your
final moments on earth.

54:21.611 --> 54:23.947
Oh. Mmm.

54:32.372 --> 54:36.668
The final resting place
of Baron Wolfgang McLaren III.

54:38.670 --> 54:40.630
Jimmy's the reason
I ended up in this shit-hole?

54:40.797 --> 54:42.966
He is our salvation and our only hope.

54:43.133 --> 54:46.845
The prophesy foretold of when the last
of the McLaren clan would return.

54:47.011 --> 54:50.265
With his blood and that of a virgin,
Carmilla shall rise again.

54:50.432 --> 54:52.642
Concealed within this tomb is the weapon...

54:52.809 --> 54:55.603
...that can slay the beast forever:
The sword of Daeldo.

54:55.770 --> 54:59.315
- And what's that, then?
- Daeldo, the god of lust...

54:59.482 --> 55:02.902
...said to be Carmilla's arch demonic foe
in the underworld of Hades.

55:03.069 --> 55:04.863
A hideous multi-tentacled beast.

55:05.029 --> 55:07.866
The only being brave enough
to have tried to penetrate...

55:08.032 --> 55:11.035
Carmilla's vilest depths,
and paid for it with his life.

55:11.202 --> 55:13.705
Let me get this straight.
Your plan is...

55:13.872 --> 55:17.917
...wait for this bitch to be resurrected,
stake her with the sword of whatever...

55:18.084 --> 55:21.421
...thus rescuing my mate, curing
your daughter, ending the curse...

55:21.588 --> 55:24.549
- And saving the planet.
- Exactly. So, are you with me?

55:24.716 --> 55:27.594
Not really. I ain't got much
fucking choice, have I?

55:29.721 --> 55:32.474
You do this.
I need to check on my Rebecca.

55:32.640 --> 55:34.768
What? Now I've got to unearth a corpse?

55:34.934 --> 55:38.688
- Concealed within this tomb is...
- Yeah, yeah. Save me the monologues.

55:42.859 --> 55:46.154
This is officially
the worst holiday ever.

56:08.968 --> 56:13.014
- So there's a red moon, right?
- Forget about the red moon.

56:13.181 --> 56:15.392
She said the last McLaren will fall.

56:15.558 --> 56:18.603
Yeah, I kind of missed that bit.

56:18.770 --> 56:21.606
Oh. Well...

56:21.773 --> 56:25.402
- That'll be me, then. Oh, bollocks.
- Shut up. I'm thinking.

56:25.568 --> 56:28.446
What can you be thinking about
at a time like this?

56:28.613 --> 56:31.032
- How we are going to escape.
- Fantastic. Any ideas?

56:31.199 --> 56:33.660
- No, have you?
- Not a fucking sausage.

56:33.827 --> 56:35.328
Come on, think!

56:35.495 --> 56:39.165
I'm too busy shitting myself
to come up with a daring escape plan.

56:52.721 --> 56:56.057
- You're cute.
- What?

56:56.224 --> 56:58.226
It's our first argument.

57:04.315 --> 57:07.569
Vic, we're doomed.
That ain't opening.

57:07.736 --> 57:09.779
Move.

57:14.868 --> 57:17.871
In my defence,
I only tried that side, so...

57:31.009 --> 57:33.344
- You go down there, my boy.
- Excuse me?

57:33.511 --> 57:37.849
- There's no time to waste. Hurry up.
- Well, you go down, then.

57:40.560 --> 57:45.356
Oh, my... Unbelievable.
It's not my daughter.

57:47.233 --> 57:52.363
- Can you see the sword?
- Give me a minute, please.

57:52.530 --> 57:56.826
It's my first time
in a tomb... Grave... Stone.

58:05.919 --> 58:07.587
What? What is it?

58:07.754 --> 58:10.673
It's nothing.

58:14.719 --> 58:19.849
What's so funny in there?

58:23.853 --> 58:26.398
It's got a big metal cock for a handle.

58:26.564 --> 58:30.360
Grow up! The handle draws on
the power of the demon Daeldo...

58:30.527 --> 58:34.489
...rendering this blade alone capable
of destroying her once and for all.

58:35.990 --> 58:40.161
- What? How?
- Itjust does, OK?

58:41.246 --> 58:45.125
We're gonna go there,
and we're gonna to die, right?

58:45.291 --> 58:47.669
All because you insist some sword...

58:47.836 --> 58:50.630
...with a metal cock on the end,
can save the world?

58:50.797 --> 58:53.550
- You're a disgrace.
- At least I can see the funny side.

58:53.717 --> 58:58.221
Let's get on with the job. I'll load up
on weapons. You cover the baron up.

59:02.475 --> 59:05.520
Will you just admit
it does look like a cock?

59:06.604 --> 59:11.234
Jimmy, can I tell you something?

59:11.401 --> 59:14.487
- Have you come up with a plan?
- No, I'm still thinking.

59:14.654 --> 59:17.031
I think we're running out of time.

59:18.533 --> 59:22.037
I just wanted to say that had we met
under different circumstances...

59:22.203 --> 59:24.456
I would've liked to have gotten
to know you.

59:24.622 --> 59:26.374
- Really?
- Yes.

59:26.541 --> 59:30.211
In fact, even though we've just spent
a few hours together...

59:30.378 --> 59:32.672
I feel like I've known you forever.

59:36.259 --> 59:38.928
- Really?
- Yes.

59:39.095 --> 59:42.098
I thought you might have
picked up on my signals.

59:43.433 --> 59:45.769
Signals? What signals?
What did I miss?

59:47.562 --> 59:49.314
Jimmy, I love you.

59:55.111 --> 59:58.406
- Well, that's just fucking great.
- I didn't mean to upset you.

59:58.573 --> 01:00:02.744
- On the brink of death, you say that?
- I can't die without letting you know...

01:00:02.911 --> 01:00:05.955
...you're the first man I could
share myself with completely.

01:00:06.122 --> 01:00:09.250
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- I would've given you everything:

01:00:09.417 --> 01:00:12.337
My mind, soul and body.

01:00:12.504 --> 01:00:16.341
- And body. Hmm.
- And now that'll never be.

01:00:23.681 --> 01:00:26.559
- It is time.
- Oh, God!

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:33.608
- That's my penis.
- Get off him, you bitch! He's mine!

01:00:43.993 --> 01:00:46.037
Wow.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:56.047
What? What did you just say?

01:00:56.214 --> 01:00:59.342
You called me a what?
I'm a fat piece of what?

01:01:06.683 --> 01:01:10.895
No one messes with the Fletchmeister
and his cock sword.

01:01:12.439 --> 01:01:18.194
Oh, hello.
Um, I wasn't doing, um...

01:01:18.361 --> 01:01:22.198
<i>Star Wars is not, uh...
Aah! Chewie. I wasn't...</i>

01:01:22.365 --> 01:01:25.535
What are you doing out?
You probably shouldn't be out here.

01:01:25.702 --> 01:01:28.496
I know.

01:01:28.663 --> 01:01:32.917
- So, it's your birthday?
- Today.

01:01:33.084 --> 01:01:35.420
It's just gone midnight.

01:01:36.796 --> 01:01:40.550
All... Grown... Up.

01:01:43.136 --> 01:01:46.014
- So you're 18?
- Uh-huh.

01:01:46.848 --> 01:01:48.892
- But Daddy wouldn't approve anyway.
- Oh.

01:01:58.068 --> 01:02:00.111
Daddy!

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:20.799
Fletch!

01:02:27.263 --> 01:02:29.349
- Ready?
- Yep.

01:02:31.226 --> 01:02:35.105
We have little time.
My Rebecca will soon be taken.

01:02:35.271 --> 01:02:37.023
Yep.

01:02:58.670 --> 01:03:01.297
You have his eyes.

01:03:01.464 --> 01:03:04.300
I used to love those eyes.

01:03:04.467 --> 01:03:07.512
Until I learned how pathetic men are.

01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:19.232
Mmm! Exquisite.

01:03:20.024 --> 01:03:24.696
I will bleed you slowly and
let Carmilla feed upon your flesh...

01:03:24.863 --> 01:03:27.490
...while it is still warm in your veins.

01:03:39.002 --> 01:03:44.591
<i>Amazing grace.</i>

01:03:44.758 --> 01:03:49.637
Look, the moon bleeds.
The resurrection has begun.

01:03:49.804 --> 01:03:52.515
Here. Holy water.

01:03:52.682 --> 01:03:55.060
It's like a fucking
hand grenade of acid.

01:03:55.226 --> 01:03:56.936
- You said "fucking" again.
- So?

01:03:57.103 --> 01:03:58.605
- It's weird.
- Get over it.

01:03:58.772 --> 01:04:01.775
There's no need to panic, my friend.
Just stay close to me.

01:04:01.941 --> 01:04:04.819
I'm well-versed in the knowledge
of killing vampires.

01:04:04.986 --> 01:04:10.450
Yeah, so is everyone. Stakes, garlic,
beheading, holy water, sunlight...

01:04:10.617 --> 01:04:13.036
There's not a fucker alive
who doesn't know that.

01:04:13.203 --> 01:04:14.996
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:04:15.163 --> 01:04:18.500
It's in books, films, telly.
It's pretty common knowledge.

01:04:24.798 --> 01:04:27.759
Were you expecting many
sexual encounters, my friend?

01:04:30.095 --> 01:04:31.846
Water bomb fight.

01:04:32.013 --> 01:04:35.725
So where's this resurrection
likely to be happening?

01:04:35.892 --> 01:04:39.437
In there. The crypt of Carmilla.

01:04:39.604 --> 01:04:42.190
I knew you were gonna say that.

01:04:42.357 --> 01:04:44.901
Never going to be somewhere
un-scary-sounding...

01:04:45.068 --> 01:04:46.986
...like the garden or scullery?

01:04:47.153 --> 01:04:48.905
- "Scullery" is quite scary.
- Eh?

01:04:49.072 --> 01:04:51.241
"Scullery" has got
the word "skull" in it.

01:04:51.408 --> 01:04:54.828
As opposed to the crypt, which has
got corpses in it. Well observed.

01:04:56.996 --> 01:05:00.166
Remember this: They can die fast
or they can die slow...

01:05:00.333 --> 01:05:01.751
...but they have to die.

01:05:01.918 --> 01:05:05.922
- Can't we do this in the morning?
- It may be too late for your friends.

01:05:06.089 --> 01:05:09.300
- It will be too late for Rebecca.
- No, I'm good.

01:05:09.467 --> 01:05:11.177
Well, this is it.

01:05:11.344 --> 01:05:15.598
Good luck, Fletch.
Let's try to come back alive.

01:05:15.765 --> 01:05:17.600
Vic...

01:05:19.477 --> 01:05:22.063
If I don't make it out of this...

01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:25.108
...there's one thing I want you to know:

01:05:25.275 --> 01:05:27.610
I blame you entirely.

01:06:25.627 --> 01:06:29.339
So this is how your bloodline ends:

01:06:29.506 --> 01:06:31.633
Crying like a baby.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:35.053
Begging for your life.

01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:38.181
- Please...
- Jimmy, pull yourself together.

01:06:38.348 --> 01:06:41.184
- Don't give her the satisfaction.
- No.

01:06:41.351 --> 01:06:45.063
You'll give me my satisfaction.

01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:48.191
Lotte, just so you know,
before she turns you...

01:06:48.358 --> 01:06:50.902
I found you really attractive,
pre-vampirism.

01:06:51.069 --> 01:06:53.780
You did?

01:07:00.787 --> 01:07:02.789
- We have an escape plan.
- What?

01:07:02.956 --> 01:07:04.290
Fletch will save us.

01:07:04.457 --> 01:07:07.252
Fletch? He's fucking useless.
We're dead meat.

01:07:07.419 --> 01:07:10.797
- Hey! You cheeky prick.
- Fletch!

01:07:10.964 --> 01:07:13.049
Although, to be fair...

01:07:13.216 --> 01:07:16.302
...if I could've avoided being here,
I would've.

01:07:23.017 --> 01:07:26.146
Oh, damn.

01:07:26.312 --> 01:07:29.524
I told you he was fucking useless.

01:07:30.692 --> 01:07:33.820
- Damn, damn!
- You ever fired that thing before?

01:07:33.987 --> 01:07:36.740
- First time.
- Watch and weep. So!

01:07:38.366 --> 01:07:41.536
You clam-lappers fancy
a piece of me then, do you?

01:07:43.163 --> 01:07:45.874
- Come on, then.
- Kill them.

01:07:46.041 --> 01:07:49.961
Oh, fuck!

01:08:07.854 --> 01:08:10.440
Oh, wait up. Fuck this.

01:08:10.607 --> 01:08:13.693
Your friend's blood
has already been drawn.

01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:16.738
- The resurrection has begun.
- We gotta get out of here.

01:08:16.904 --> 01:08:19.491
We can't. Darkness is upon us.
Your friends, Rebecca...

01:08:19.657 --> 01:08:21.826
I reckon I can
probably live with that.

01:08:21.993 --> 01:08:23.828
...and the entire fucking world!

01:08:23.995 --> 01:08:27.457
You know how to put a guilt trip on,
don't you, you fucker?

01:08:28.582 --> 01:08:33.171
Right. Let's do this.

01:08:38.051 --> 01:08:42.764
- It'll be OK.
- How can this be OK?

01:08:42.930 --> 01:08:45.140
All I wanted to do was enjoy life.

01:08:45.308 --> 01:08:47.769
Hike, get some fresh air, a few pints.

01:08:47.935 --> 01:08:50.397
But no. Nothing's as simple
as that, is it?

01:08:50.563 --> 01:08:53.108
And now we're gonna end up dead.

01:08:53.274 --> 01:08:56.903
Well, I'm gonna end up dead.
You'll be a lesbian.

01:08:57.069 --> 01:08:59.572
And I've not even made love to a man.

01:08:59.738 --> 01:09:01.366
Oh!

01:09:09.916 --> 01:09:11.376
The crypt is through here.

01:09:13.502 --> 01:09:15.671
<i>- Fletch!
- Spiritus Sancti.</i>

01:09:17.674 --> 01:09:19.676
Fletch!

01:09:20.926 --> 01:09:24.389
<i>- Spiritus sancti.
- Hurry up!</i>

01:09:24.555 --> 01:09:27.559
- Jimmy?
- Back, you spawn of Satan.

01:09:29.728 --> 01:09:31.145
- Fletch?
- How you been?

01:09:31.312 --> 01:09:33.523
Up and down.

01:09:37.152 --> 01:09:40.238
- There's only one solution now.
- The big cock sword.

01:09:40.404 --> 01:09:41.781
- What?
- Long story.

01:09:43.491 --> 01:09:46.745
- Hand me the sword of Daeldo.
- Haven't you got it?

01:09:46.911 --> 01:09:48.162
I thought you had it.

01:09:48.328 --> 01:09:50.497
You're going on about
how important it is.

01:09:50.665 --> 01:09:53.542
All we've got to do is wait
for this bitch to rise, stab her...

01:09:53.710 --> 01:09:56.337
- And you forgot the sword?
- Get it. I'll keep 'em off.

01:09:56.504 --> 01:09:58.798
- Tell Rebecca I love her.
- About Rebecca...

01:09:58.965 --> 01:10:00.550
- Run, you fool!
- All right!

01:10:31.039 --> 01:10:33.291
Jesus!

01:11:49.034 --> 01:11:53.621
- Whores of fucking Hades.
- Annihilate him.

01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:01.921
Prepare for fucking death!

01:12:11.806 --> 01:12:15.018
Come on, you silly fuckers!

01:12:16.144 --> 01:12:19.814
- Lotte!
- It's playtime, darling.

01:12:28.365 --> 01:12:30.784
Mmm! You are a feisty one.

01:12:33.203 --> 01:12:35.663
I like it. Aah!

01:12:44.881 --> 01:12:47.675
- It won't budge.
- I have to help her.

01:12:47.842 --> 01:12:49.928
It's not gonna work.

01:12:52.055 --> 01:12:56.810
- What is it with you and doors?
- Let's ram it.

01:13:01.398 --> 01:13:04.150
Mmm! You taste divine.

01:13:08.405 --> 01:13:10.198
- Keys.
- Vicar's got them.

01:13:10.365 --> 01:13:12.283
- What?
- Know how to hotwire a hearse?

01:13:12.450 --> 01:13:14.452
- Yeah, no worries.
- Brilliant. Let's go.

01:13:14.619 --> 01:13:16.663
- Of course I don't, you idiot.
- Shit.

01:13:25.296 --> 01:13:29.551
First I'm going to torture you,
then I'm going to turn you.

01:13:29.718 --> 01:13:32.637
- You'll be my plaything.
- Never!

01:13:32.804 --> 01:13:34.264
That's it, then.

01:13:34.431 --> 01:13:36.975
The problem with you, James,
you're a pessimist.

01:13:37.142 --> 01:13:41.062
You might want to grab weapons.
We could be in for a ruck.

01:13:50.113 --> 01:13:51.906
Come on!

01:14:00.206 --> 01:14:03.626
- That sword's got a cock for a handle.
- It's funny, isn't it?

01:14:03.793 --> 01:14:06.796
It's the only thing that'll
destroy that psycho bitch.

01:14:06.963 --> 01:14:08.882
It's very powerful and very ancient.

01:14:09.049 --> 01:14:11.968
- Sort of gay.
- So get your own fucking sword.

01:14:35.075 --> 01:14:38.161
I knew you would not resist me forever.

01:14:57.555 --> 01:15:00.642
Sorry, you're not my type.

01:15:21.579 --> 01:15:25.250
- Whoo-hoo!
- Lotte.

01:16:06.082 --> 01:16:08.293
- Bollocks.
- Fletch.

01:16:31.232 --> 01:16:34.319
Oh, my God!

01:17:07.685 --> 01:17:09.771
McLaren.

01:17:18.738 --> 01:17:21.908
- Jimmy!
- Throw it like you mean it!

01:17:43.263 --> 01:17:47.308
Un-fucking-believable!

01:18:41.112 --> 01:18:44.074
Is somebody taking the piss?

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:48.078
The sword of Daeldo
is a mighty weapon indeed.

01:18:49.496 --> 01:18:51.122
Looks like the vic was right.

01:18:51.289 --> 01:18:54.709
Everyone seems to know what's
going on bar me. Whatjust happened?

01:18:54.876 --> 01:18:58.004
It's all cock swords and scary stuff
and history and that.

01:18:58.171 --> 01:19:00.215
- I'll tell you later.
- Tell me now.

01:19:00.382 --> 01:19:01.758
- I will.
- When?

01:19:01.925 --> 01:19:03.843
Mate, do you want to calm down?

01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:07.263
I've had a bit of a busy night.
I'll tell you in a minute.

01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:10.141
- Whoa.
- No, look. Sunlight.

01:19:10.308 --> 01:19:13.853
The curse has lifted.

01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:17.899
- So they're not vampires anymore?
- No.

01:19:18.066 --> 01:19:21.361
Cool. Are they still lesbians?

01:19:21.528 --> 01:19:25.031
For fuck's sake.

01:19:27.575 --> 01:19:29.411
Uh...

01:19:37.752 --> 01:19:40.422
Unbelievable.
Save the day, not even a kiss.

01:19:40.588 --> 01:19:43.091
Do you know what? Actually, forget it.

01:19:43.258 --> 01:19:45.176
Forget it. Forget it. Let it go.

01:19:45.343 --> 01:19:48.054
Let it go, Fletch.
You're the bigger man.

01:19:54.477 --> 01:19:58.815
Whoa! That's some mighty fine
hotwiring skills you got there, lady.

01:19:58.982 --> 01:20:01.443
Thanks. Right. Now what?

01:20:01.609 --> 01:20:04.195
Don't know. Go home?

01:20:04.362 --> 01:20:08.366
Go home? They've taken my friends,
they very nearly took our lives...

01:20:08.533 --> 01:20:11.453
...and we never even dreamed
they existed before tonight.

01:20:11.619 --> 01:20:14.914
How can we just go home to our beds?

01:20:15.081 --> 01:20:17.292
- What's she talking about?
- Uh...

01:20:17.459 --> 01:20:19.002
This village is free...

01:20:19.169 --> 01:20:22.881
...but more creatures like Carmilla lurk
in the dark corners of the world.

01:20:23.048 --> 01:20:25.258
No one would believe us if we tell.

01:20:25.425 --> 01:20:27.927
We are the only people
who know the truth.

01:20:28.094 --> 01:20:30.805
We must go out there
and fight this menace.

01:20:30.972 --> 01:20:34.976
Are you suggesting we become
lesbian vampire killers?

01:20:35.143 --> 01:20:38.063
<i>If that's what it takes,ja.</i>

01:20:40.398 --> 01:20:44.986
Well, I ain't got anything else on
in particular at the moment, so I'm in.

01:20:45.153 --> 01:20:47.072
- Jim?
- I don't know.

01:20:47.238 --> 01:20:50.408
Oh, come on. It's in your blood,
your destiny, all that shit.

01:20:50.575 --> 01:20:51.993
- Huh?
- I'll tell you later.

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:56.081
- Come on. You might as well.
- Join us.

01:20:56.247 --> 01:20:59.292
Lesbian vampire killers, it is.
Let's ride.

01:20:59.459 --> 01:21:01.711
Whoo-hoo!

01:21:37.956 --> 01:21:41.042
<i>Let's go for a little walk.</i>

01:21:41.209 --> 01:21:44.254
<i>Under the moon above.</i>

01:21:44.421 --> 01:21:47.757
<i>Let's sit down and talk.</i>

01:21:47.924 --> 01:21:50.093
<i>Under the moon of love.</i>

01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:53.096
<i>I wanna tell you that I love you.</i>

01:21:53.263 --> 01:21:58.101
<i>And I want you to be my girl
Little darling, let's walk, let's talk.</i>

01:21:58.268 --> 01:22:03.231
<i>- Under the moon of love.
- The moon of love...</i>

01:22:03.398 --> 01:22:06.693
<i>You are looking so lovely.</i>

01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:10.196
<i>Under the moon of love.</i>

01:22:10.363 --> 01:22:12.824
<i>Your eyes shine so brightly.</i>

01:22:12.991 --> 01:22:15.577
<i>Under the moon of love.</i>

01:22:15.744 --> 01:22:18.663
<i>I wanna go all the time.</i>

01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:20.957
<i>You'll be my love tonight.</i>

01:22:21.124 --> 01:22:24.002
<i>Little darling, let's walk, let's talk.</i>

01:22:24.169 --> 01:22:28.256
<i>- Under the moon of love.
- The moon of love.</i>

01:22:28.423 --> 01:22:30.675
<i>I want to talk sweet talk.</i>

01:22:30.842 --> 01:22:34.763
<i>And whisper things in your ear.</i>

01:22:34.929 --> 01:22:39.976
<i>I'm gonna tell you lots of things
I know you've been longing to hear.</i>

01:22:40.143 --> 01:22:42.645
<i>Come on, little darling, take my hand.</i>

01:22:42.812 --> 01:22:45.356
<i>Let's go for a little walk.</i>

01:22:45.523 --> 01:22:48.526
<i>Under the moon of love.</i>

01:22:48.693 --> 01:22:51.780
<i>Let's sit down and talk.</i>

01:22:51.946 --> 01:22:53.907
<i>Under the moon of love.</i>

01:22:54.074 --> 01:22:57.494
<i>I wanna tell you that I love you.</i>

01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:02.749
<i>And I want you to be my girl.
Little darling, let's walk, let's talk.</i>

01:23:02.916 --> 01:23:07.087
<i>- Under the moon of love.
- The moon of love.</i>
