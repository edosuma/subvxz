WEBVTT

00:13.214 --> 00:15.681
Scenario 37...

00:15.683 --> 00:19.018
<i>agent-to-agent transfer.</i>

00:50.183 --> 00:52.317
Pharaoh, please.

00:58.458 --> 01:03.362
I don't know which is colder,
the wind or the winter.

01:03.364 --> 01:06.198
And weary winter comin' fast

01:06.200 --> 01:09.134
<i>and cozy here beneath the blast.</i>

01:30.723 --> 01:32.458
You there.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.793
What's the price for one of those?

01:37.130 --> 01:39.364
I'm afraid these are not for sale.

01:39.366 --> 01:42.534
Agreement with the commissary.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.471
Oi, you turn your back on me?

01:48.274 --> 01:50.609
It's one measly egg.

01:50.611 --> 01:53.412
And I've the balsam to pay.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.814
So how's about you quit acting a lout

01:55.816 --> 01:59.218
'fore I shove one of these
bumnuts down your throat?

02:02.423 --> 02:05.657
Oh, look at what you done now.

02:08.561 --> 02:11.330
Hey, what's this?

02:24.845 --> 02:29.915
Traitor. Traitor.
I killed the traitor.

02:44.731 --> 02:48.534
Try, try again.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.437
<i>â™ª Hush, hush</i>

02:52.439 --> 02:54.206
<i>â™ª There's snakes in the garden â™ª</i>

02:54.208 --> 02:57.843
<i>â™ª Soul for sale</i>

02:57.845 --> 03:00.546
<i>â™ª Blood on the rise</i>

03:02.248 --> 03:04.449
<i>â™ª Hush, hush</i>

03:04.451 --> 03:10.222
- <i>â™ª I can't wait anymore</i>
<i>- â™ª Soul for sale</i>

03:10.224 --> 03:13.959
<i>â™ª I can't wait anymore</i>

03:16.229 --> 03:19.598
<i>â™ª Hush, hush...</i>

03:24.204 --> 03:26.538
<i>Shoulder firelocks!</i>

03:43.756 --> 03:47.259
<i>The prisoner exchange was
carried through this morning, Excellency.</i>

03:47.261 --> 03:50.596
And what is the
condition of our returned?

03:50.598 --> 03:52.731
Very poor, sir.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.801
Some are unable to walk
owing to starvation.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.604
It confirms Captain Gamble's account...

03:58.606 --> 04:00.739
the enemy treat our captured with brutality

04:00.741 --> 04:03.742
while we protect theirs
according to protocol.

04:09.549 --> 04:11.316
"To Lord Howe.

04:11.318 --> 04:13.318
I am sorry to trouble Your Lordship

04:13.320 --> 04:15.654
with a letter almost wholly on the subject

04:15.656 --> 04:18.824
of the barbaric treatment
our officers received

04:18.826 --> 04:21.692
on board your prison ship
in New York Harbor."

04:21.695 --> 04:24.029
Prepare a copy of Captain Gamble's account.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.697
- I want it enclosed.
- Yes, sir.

04:25.699 --> 04:28.367
"I call upon Your Lordship to say

04:28.369 --> 04:30.702
if our treatment of your men

04:30.704 --> 04:34.006
had merited so severe
a retaliation..."

04:34.008 --> 04:37.676
Absent without leave, falsifying
intelligence, insubordination...

04:37.678 --> 04:41.480
I want you to know, Captain, I plan
to leave nothing out of my report.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.715
I wouldn't expect you to, sir.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.985
Though you should know, I already
told the commander everything I did.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.721
Well, then likely your
punishment's been decided

04:49.723 --> 04:52.964
and we've merely been called
here to see it carried out.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.815
The accused, John Herring,

05:16.817 --> 05:19.584
having been convicted
of breaking into the house

05:19.586 --> 05:23.955
of Mr. Prince Howland and
robbing him of several spoons,

05:23.957 --> 05:26.892
<i>silver dollars, and wearing apparel,</i>

05:26.894 --> 05:30.429
<i>has been sentenced to suffer death.</i>

05:30.431 --> 05:32.864
<i>His Excellency, the commander in chief,</i>

05:32.866 --> 05:36.368
<i>approves this sentence as an example made</i>

05:36.370 --> 05:41.807
<i>to deter the boldest and
most hardened offenders.</i>

05:57.056 --> 05:59.024
Shall we?

06:24.050 --> 06:26.618
This is
Mr. Nathaniel Sackett

06:26.620 --> 06:29.421
of the Committee to Detect and Defeat

06:29.423 --> 06:31.957
Conspiracies against America.

06:31.959 --> 06:35.861
Sir, the presence of a civilian at
court-martial is highly irregular.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.429
Yes, I agree, Charles.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.865
Now, would you be so kind
as to brief the room

06:39.867 --> 06:42.534
on the intelligence uncovered at Trenton?

06:42.536 --> 06:46.772
- Brief the room?
- Myself included.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.107
Ahem.

06:49.109 --> 06:51.843
An examination of orders

06:51.845 --> 06:53.812
discovered in the desk of Colonel Rall

06:53.814 --> 06:55.814
suggests that the garrison
we took from the Hessians

06:55.816 --> 06:58.183
was much more than a winter camp.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.952
Trenton was being prepared
as a launch point

07:00.954 --> 07:02.487
for an attack on Philadelphia.

07:02.489 --> 07:05.724
I know what Howe wants.

07:05.726 --> 07:10.061
But how will Howe take it?

07:10.063 --> 07:12.030
<i>By land...</i>

07:13.466 --> 07:15.801
by sea...

07:17.770 --> 07:20.972
or will he lunge north
to join forces with Burgoyne

07:20.974 --> 07:24.843
so as to decapitate New England
from the rest of our colonies?

07:26.479 --> 07:28.079
We have until the snow melts

07:28.081 --> 07:31.049
before their forces
in New York begin to move.

07:33.653 --> 07:34.953
New York.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.955
Which remains dark to us.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.991
Sir, I have just dispatched new
scouts to observe the enemy.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.194
I grow weary of contradictory accounts

07:42.196 --> 07:45.997
that merely guess at
the intent of the enemy.

07:47.533 --> 07:50.535
This letter written by
your man on Long Island...

07:50.537 --> 07:52.704
That letter was not received
through the proper channels.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.073
Which is why I paid it no mind.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.075
It was a lone report and unconfirmed

07:57.077 --> 08:01.613
until our victories at Trenton and
Princeton proved it accurate.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.849
More accurate than any
piece of intelligence

08:03.851 --> 08:07.118
we've received thus far, at least.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.788
Gentlemen, I've asked you here today

08:09.790 --> 08:12.858
to determine if this was a fluke

08:12.860 --> 08:15.060
and, perhaps more importantly,

08:15.062 --> 08:19.498
<i>if this fluke can be repeated.</i>

08:30.543 --> 08:32.210
Mornin'.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.078
What's your business in New York?

08:34.081 --> 08:36.014
Feeding your officers.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.618
These hogs I have here are bound for
Colonel Cook of the commissary.

08:39.620 --> 08:42.254
- Papers?
- Yes, sir.

08:42.256 --> 08:43.989
Thank you.

08:43.991 --> 08:47.292
- You often travel alone?
<i>- Usually I do, yeah.</i>

08:47.294 --> 08:50.161
Is that...
is that a problem?

08:50.163 --> 08:51.696
- Not for me.
- Great.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.231
Thought you might have
trouble closer to the city.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.634
They're still jumpy from the fire.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.702
And after the rebels' victories,

08:57.704 --> 09:00.305
they see lone arsonists everywhere.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.609
You look like you might
give them real trouble.

09:06.613 --> 09:08.880
Safe travels,
Mr. Woodhull.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.615
Thanks.

09:12.318 --> 09:15.287
Go.

09:19.592 --> 09:21.793
<i>I can assure you, sir, you
will be perfectly convinced</i>

09:21.795 --> 09:24.062
<i>of my friend's integrity and loyalty.</i>

09:24.064 --> 09:27.799
Well, according to you, he took an
oath of loyalty to King George.

09:27.801 --> 09:31.202
Only to get closer to the
enemy, to learn their secrets.

09:31.204 --> 09:35.574
Traditional military reconnaissance
is a proven discipline.

09:35.576 --> 09:38.076
Multiple scouts produce multiple reports

09:38.078 --> 09:41.012
which may be cross-referenced
to ensure verification.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.648
In addition, soldiers
are trained to recognize...

09:43.650 --> 09:47.085
Actually, soldiers make terrible spies.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.188
All that discipline
drilled into their movements

09:50.190 --> 09:54.225
makes them easy to spot,
unlike us civilians.

09:54.227 --> 09:58.830
Excuse me, sir, but why
exactly are you in this room?

09:58.832 --> 10:01.700
I've been invited here
by your commander in chief

10:01.702 --> 10:04.669
to opine on the business at hand.

10:04.671 --> 10:08.673
Mr. Sackett came to us
by way of William Duer,

10:08.675 --> 10:13.244
who recommended him as a person
of intrigue and secrecy.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.080
And I must say, I find this young man's

10:15.082 --> 10:17.983
<i>chain of agents very intriguing.</i>

10:17.985 --> 10:21.186
I want this chain notion explored

10:21.188 --> 10:24.055
and a unified recommendation
presented upon my return.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.057
Any questions?

10:26.059 --> 10:30.195
- I...
- Well, yes, Your Excellency.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.930
The letter that I transcribed

10:31.932 --> 10:34.065
regarding the Hessians and Trenton.

10:34.067 --> 10:36.334
It was unsigned.

10:36.336 --> 10:40.739
I mean to ask, how did you come
by the name Abraham Woodhull?

10:40.741 --> 10:43.842
Excellent question.

10:43.844 --> 10:46.044
Any for you,
Mr. Sackett?

10:46.046 --> 10:48.813
Plenty, but not for you, sir.

10:48.815 --> 10:51.049
Very well.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.289
Singing "Johnny's Gone For A Soldier"

10:58.291 --> 11:01.226
â™ª He'll not come back for many a day â™ª

11:01.228 --> 11:05.930
â™ª Johnny's gone
for a soldier... â™ª

11:05.932 --> 11:07.365
Hey.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.300
Hey.

11:13.839 --> 11:16.041
Can you hit 'em with your rifle?

11:17.376 --> 11:19.444
I think it came from over here somewhere.

11:19.446 --> 11:22.213
<i>Don't worry...</i>

11:25.217 --> 11:27.152
I got ya.

11:29.955 --> 11:34.125
â™ª He'll not come back for many a day â™ª

11:34.127 --> 11:37.395
â™ª Johnny's gone
for a soldier... â™ª

11:38.932 --> 11:41.866
<i>â™ª With pipe and drum</i>
<i>he marched away...â™ª</i>

11:43.203 --> 11:46.771
- <i>â™ª He would not heed...</i>

12:02.922 --> 12:04.823
<i>Are you nearly finished?</i>

12:04.825 --> 12:07.292
We have important company
arriving, Abigail.

12:07.294 --> 12:10.895
We must show them a respectable welcome.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.398
Now, let's have a look.

12:15.101 --> 12:19.437
Oh, dear.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.439
I'm afraid this is all wrong.

12:21.441 --> 12:24.776
I'm sorry, sir.

12:24.778 --> 12:27.812
I just arranged it how my
mistress had taught me.

12:27.814 --> 12:30.515
I don't expect you to
anticipate my preferences.

12:30.517 --> 12:33.151
Then again...

12:33.153 --> 12:36.888
it is never too late to learn.

12:38.157 --> 12:39.958
Have a seat.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.026
Please have a seat.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.199
Show me how your former mistress

12:48.201 --> 12:50.535
would cut up and eat her meat.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.816
It is the European custom,
and most appropriate,

13:04.818 --> 13:09.487
to switch and feed oneself

13:09.489 --> 13:12.323
with the dominant hand.

13:13.826 --> 13:15.894
The time it takes to transfer

13:15.896 --> 13:20.431
prevents us from descending into gluttony.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.867
You must think us mad

13:22.869 --> 13:26.905
to devote such attention
to trivialities, don't you?

13:26.907 --> 13:31.075
I know I certainly did when I
was first made to learn it all.

13:32.511 --> 13:36.815
If I ask you your opinion, you
need not be afraid to give it.

13:38.217 --> 13:40.819
I want you to feel safe here

13:40.821 --> 13:45.423
and perhaps find reason to smile.

13:50.263 --> 13:53.198
And here they are.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.873
Happy return, gentlemen.

14:01.875 --> 14:05.910
<i>You should all feel free to relax
and get some rest tonight.</i>

14:05.912 --> 14:08.880
<i>Tomorrow, I shall interview each of you</i>

14:08.882 --> 14:11.382
regarding your time in captivity.

14:11.384 --> 14:14.118
Abigail will show you to your rooms.

14:32.004 --> 14:34.539
Look at this.

14:34.541 --> 14:39.043
Liberty never smelled
so sweet, hey, snowball?

14:41.648 --> 14:44.649
I smell his tackle on your breath.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.259
You gonna pick it up?

14:54.261 --> 14:56.361
Listen to the pickaninny.

14:56.363 --> 15:00.565
We be Queen's Rangers, son.
Back to your digging.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.035
Did you say the Queen's Monkeys?

15:07.406 --> 15:09.540
There's your monkey.

15:12.011 --> 15:15.113
You wanna play?

15:17.616 --> 15:20.251
Come on.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.468
No eyes on him.

15:42.174 --> 15:44.642
I am sorry to keep you waiting,

15:44.644 --> 15:46.611
but, you see, I've been
looking for someone.

15:46.613 --> 15:50.581
I've been tracking a man
who killed one of my boys.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.250
And it's been four months...

15:52.252 --> 15:54.585
just one of them, four months...

15:54.587 --> 15:57.956
so, you see, if you hurt
a Ranger, you pay a price.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.191
<i>Now, it's nothing personal.</i>
<i>That's just the rules.</i>

16:00.193 --> 16:02.327
Do what you will.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.662
Oh, yeah, I will.

16:04.664 --> 16:08.733
But before all that, I just wanna ask ya,

16:08.735 --> 16:13.104
where the hell did you learn
how to use staves like this?

16:13.106 --> 16:17.208
I have seen all manner of lethality,

16:17.210 --> 16:19.477
but you showed me something new today.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.746
I'm Maasai.

16:21.748 --> 16:24.549
We train with <i>fimbos for initiation.</i>

16:24.551 --> 16:27.986
Fimbos?

16:27.988 --> 16:29.620
Go on, then.
Show me.

16:29.622 --> 16:33.391
Only warriors are initiated.

16:34.994 --> 16:38.763
I have been a warrior for 30 years, boy.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.233
Let me put him down, Major.

16:42.235 --> 16:45.370
Drop your iron.
I'll make you my meat.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.372
While you dream, snowball.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.307
We'll have a fair fight, then.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.576
The lads'll make a little coin,

16:51.578 --> 16:56.147
and you and he will get the
answer you're looking for?

16:58.050 --> 17:02.420
So she then hangs a black
petticoat on a drying line

17:02.422 --> 17:05.690
to signal to my courier when
the intelligence is ready.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.126
- Not bad.
- And she hangs napkins

17:08.127 --> 17:11.262
to signify which cove
is safe for the rendezvous.

17:11.263 --> 17:13.196
Wait, wait.
Rendezvous?

17:13.199 --> 17:16.666
Don't tell me your agent meets
your courier in person?

17:16.669 --> 17:19.569
Oh, well, of course.

17:19.571 --> 17:21.571
Failure.
Death.

17:21.574 --> 17:24.208
No, no, no.
Courier and agent

17:24.210 --> 17:26.109
are never in the same
place at the same time.

17:26.112 --> 17:30.081
Well, then how do you expect
for them to make the transfer?

17:30.083 --> 17:33.618
You predetermine the location

17:33.620 --> 17:36.087
to drop, <i>id est,</i> hide

17:36.089 --> 17:39.657
the <i>lettre confidentielle in question</i>

17:39.659 --> 17:43.494
and then arrange
a later time for retrieval.

17:43.496 --> 17:47.065
A dead drop...

17:47.067 --> 17:50.468
to ensure your agents don't drop dead

17:50.470 --> 17:54.639
from being caught <i>in flagrante delicto.</i>

17:54.641 --> 17:57.308
Which demonstrates
the folly of this scheme.

17:57.310 --> 18:01.112
If a single link is broken, the
entire chain is rendered useless.

18:01.114 --> 18:04.215
Which is why we use encryption, sir.

18:04.217 --> 18:07.418
To shield the men, not the message.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.721
Captain, which enciphering method

18:10.723 --> 18:12.457
have you been using thus far?

18:12.459 --> 18:15.093
Rossignol?
Trithemius?

18:15.095 --> 18:17.628
Personally, I prefer Dumas.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.338
Please tell me you're using encryption.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.141
My God.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.643
I was told you were a graduate of Yale.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.679
Yes, sir.
Class of '73.

18:36.416 --> 18:39.717
One supposes you've studied
Greek, Latin, Hebrew?

18:39.719 --> 18:42.186
<i>Nai. Certe.</i>
<i>Chen-adon.</i>

18:42.188 --> 18:45.723
And I am a quick
study, Mr. Sackett.

18:45.725 --> 18:49.293
Then at least we have somewhere to start.

18:50.429 --> 18:52.430
Commit this to memory.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.832
<i>We don't have time for this.</i>

18:53.833 --> 18:56.400
The commander expects
results, not wordplay.

18:56.402 --> 18:59.804
But we're ahead of the game,
thanks to Captain Tallmadge here.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.740
Typically, I have to concoct a legend

19:02.742 --> 19:05.877
for the agents I wish to
embed into enemy territory.

19:05.879 --> 19:10.781
A poultry trader,
fishmonger, schoolteacher.

19:10.783 --> 19:14.552
Requires wardrobe, documentation, training.

19:14.554 --> 19:20.191
The brilliance of Mr. Woodhull
is his life is his legend.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.859
There's no reason to invent a false one.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.761
He's already living it.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.864
Who pays for it?

19:26.866 --> 19:29.800
Well, if the farmer's not farming,
who provides for his expenses?

19:30.869 --> 19:35.339
His food, his lodging?
His money to bribe sources?

19:35.341 --> 19:37.542
We do, of course.

19:37.544 --> 19:41.679
The Congress will never
approve intelligencer salaries

19:41.681 --> 19:44.649
while we cobble together
bounties for our regulars.

19:44.651 --> 19:48.252
Congress needn't know about it.

19:48.254 --> 19:50.555
We'll draw from a secret fund

19:50.557 --> 19:53.658
authorized by Washington to
be used at our discretion.

19:54.459 --> 19:56.360
General, please.

19:56.362 --> 19:59.497
We've been asked to explore how
a chain of agents might work.

19:59.499 --> 20:02.700
Some debate is to be expected.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.669
Explore whatever you want, Tallmadge.

20:04.671 --> 20:07.805
As the head of intelligence,
I will never approve this.

20:09.374 --> 20:12.343
It's time that you learned how
the chain of command works.

20:14.214 --> 20:16.347
That was predictable.

20:34.801 --> 20:40.938
<i>â™ª I sold my
flax, I sold my wheel â™ª</i>

20:40.940 --> 20:46.277
â™ª To buy my love a sword of steel â™ª

20:46.279 --> 20:52.550
â™ª So it in battle he might wield â™ª

20:52.552 --> 20:58.556
â™ª Johnny's gone
for a soldier... â™ª

20:58.558 --> 21:01.659
Listen, you.
You've made a mistake.

21:03.295 --> 21:05.796
You're shivering,
Mr. Woodhull.

21:06.898 --> 21:08.899
Here.

21:08.901 --> 21:10.568
This'll warm you up.

21:10.570 --> 21:12.003
No, no, no.

21:12.005 --> 21:14.605
I am the son of a Tory magistrate.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.407
I'm a loyal subject of the Crown.

21:16.409 --> 21:19.477
You've gotta listen to me.
You've gotta listen.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.879
Little Tory boy.

21:29.321 --> 21:32.790
I'm with the 19th
Continentals under Sullivan.

21:32.792 --> 21:37.561
I've been out here five months...

21:37.563 --> 21:40.031
the last man of my unit...

21:40.033 --> 21:43.334
ambushing their dispatch
riders, hitting supply lines,

21:43.336 --> 21:47.338
all while looking for a way to
get back to the regiment proper.

21:47.340 --> 21:50.441
<i>Only reason you're still breathing</i>

21:50.443 --> 21:53.744
is I got more questions need answering

21:53.746 --> 21:58.349
about who you sell to
and where, at what price,

21:58.351 --> 22:01.085
anything they'll ask at the checkpoints.

22:01.087 --> 22:05.356
You plan to
pass yourself off as me?

22:05.358 --> 22:06.857
But that coat and that pin

22:06.859 --> 22:09.627
is as much a disguise
for me as it is for you.

22:09.629 --> 22:12.363
I'm under direct orders
to infiltrate the city

22:12.365 --> 22:14.899
and gather intelligence
for the Continental Army.

22:14.901 --> 22:17.935
- <i>I swear.</i>
<i>- Oh, I see.</i>

22:17.937 --> 22:19.837
So...

22:20.000 --> 22:21.500
you're a spy.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.400
Benjamin Tallmadge, Second
Continental Light Dragoons.

22:25.445 --> 22:29.947
He will confirm my loyalty and
he will verify my mission.

22:29.949 --> 22:33.084
Your mission?

22:37.056 --> 22:41.726
You're gonna tell me what I need to know

22:41.728 --> 22:45.529
<i>or they'll find your body</i>

22:45.531 --> 22:48.599
<i>liberated of its skin.</i>

22:52.771 --> 22:55.940
What, you know them all, trust them all?

22:55.942 --> 22:57.842
We all grew up together.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.877
Childhood friends.
Fascinating.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.879
Wouldn't have thought to try that.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.781
Well, it wasn't exactly planned.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.850
Don't tell anyone that.

23:05.852 --> 23:09.620
Don't tell anyone else
Mr. Woodhull's name.

23:09.622 --> 23:15.960
Time to gift
Mr. Woodhull an alias.

23:15.962 --> 23:19.730
One by which the other
agents will know him.

23:21.633 --> 23:23.067
I'm sorry, the other agents?

23:23.069 --> 23:26.003
I've plans for your farmer.

23:26.838 --> 23:30.408
<i>Need him to nurture the seeds</i>

23:30.410 --> 23:34.111
<i>I've planted over the last year and a half.</i>

23:34.113 --> 23:38.115
<i>One of them is sprouting right now,</i>

23:38.117 --> 23:41.419
<i>right under the enemy's nose.</i>

23:44.122 --> 23:46.957
I... no, I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid that's

23:46.959 --> 23:48.559
not how this is going to work.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.661
You see, Abe, he's a very cautious man.

23:50.663 --> 23:53.431
He won't meet with anybody
he doesn't already know.

23:53.433 --> 23:56.534
- He'll have to.
- No, he'll quit is what he'll do.

23:56.536 --> 23:58.502
I thought he was your friend.

23:58.504 --> 24:01.705
Yes, which is exactly why
he trusts me to protect him.

24:02.741 --> 24:05.910
Only that which is concealed is protected.

24:05.912 --> 24:09.113
<i>You can't even conceal his name.</i>

24:11.850 --> 24:16.587
<i>Luckily for you, I am a master
at the art of concealment.</i>

24:24.830 --> 24:27.164
Thank you, Lieutenant Terrence.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.966
I have an uncle in the Coldstream Guard,

24:28.968 --> 24:32.102
so he'll be glad we've
reclaimed one of his own.

24:32.104 --> 24:35.973
I remember the motto...
<i>"Nulli Secundam."</i>

24:35.975 --> 24:38.175
Second to none.

24:47.552 --> 24:50.254
Good evening, sir.
Have a seat.

24:50.256 --> 24:54.258
- Name and rank.
- Captain John Graves Simcoe.

24:54.260 --> 24:56.694
And where was your post?

24:56.696 --> 24:59.129
A town called Setauket.

24:59.131 --> 25:00.998
Setauket, Long Island?

25:02.200 --> 25:05.169
Ambush, was it not?

25:05.171 --> 25:08.706
Where are my manners.
Drink?

25:15.013 --> 25:17.781
And how did you find it there in Setauket?

25:17.783 --> 25:20.618
May I have some more ink, please, Abigail?

25:20.620 --> 25:23.587
This is for military record?

25:23.589 --> 25:26.957
Oh, my own personal curiosity.

25:26.959 --> 25:31.161
It's a pit run by a man who I'd say...

25:32.297 --> 25:36.233
well, best not to talk out of turn.

25:36.235 --> 25:38.135
Hewlett?

25:38.137 --> 25:40.804
"The Oyster Major," as he's
referred to in these parts.

25:42.642 --> 25:46.010
If you'd like, I could see
to arranging a transfer.

25:46.012 --> 25:49.547
Please, Major, not on my account.

25:49.549 --> 25:53.250
There's someone whom I
left far too abruptly.

25:53.252 --> 25:54.919
A local woman, perhaps?

25:54.921 --> 25:58.689
In any case, I should very
much like to return to her.

25:58.691 --> 26:01.158
By all means.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.761
Tell me about her.

26:10.335 --> 26:14.738
Well, I'm all packed up.

26:14.740 --> 26:17.174
<i>Tell me what I need to know</i>

26:17.176 --> 26:20.077
<i>or I kill that fire 'fore I go.</i>

26:20.079 --> 26:24.682
No? Have it
your way, then.

26:29.354 --> 26:33.057
My... my
father's Richard Woodhull.

26:37.228 --> 26:41.999
His deal is with Colonel Cook
for seven pounds per pound.

26:42.001 --> 26:45.769
Now, was that so hard?

26:45.771 --> 26:48.305
Tell me true...

26:48.307 --> 26:50.240
if you're such a Patriot,

26:50.242 --> 26:52.076
why didn't you enlist with the militia

26:52.078 --> 26:54.378
and fight for your country like a man?

26:56.748 --> 26:59.283
Because you can't win.

27:00.785 --> 27:03.988
Look at you.

27:03.990 --> 27:05.990
Look at your...

27:06.825 --> 27:09.360
your fort here.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.864
You're one man.

27:16.001 --> 27:18.369
You're alone in the woods...

27:20.238 --> 27:24.008
surrounded by an army

27:24.010 --> 27:26.777
on an island surrounded by a navy.

27:26.779 --> 27:30.781
That... that is
the Continental Army.

27:32.017 --> 27:34.351
That is what you're running back to.

27:36.721 --> 27:39.423
So I should be like you, then?

27:39.425 --> 27:42.693
Swear allegiance to the king with
my fingers crossed behind me?

27:42.695 --> 27:45.262
What's your family think of you?

27:51.170 --> 27:54.672
What I do, I do for my son.

27:55.907 --> 27:59.076
He know you're a liar?

28:01.012 --> 28:03.313
He's a year old.

28:03.315 --> 28:06.050
I want to be there for him
when he grows up.

28:07.352 --> 28:10.954
<i>If I had a son, I'd have him know</i>

28:10.956 --> 28:13.090
<i>I fought and died for my beliefs</i>

28:13.092 --> 28:17.194
so he could rise to avenge me.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.963
I'd want my son to choose for himself...

28:21.132 --> 28:23.901
rather than have his father choose for him.

28:23.903 --> 28:26.170
But then our...

28:26.172 --> 28:29.373
views on liberty...

28:29.375 --> 28:33.277
true liberty...
may differ.

28:35.847 --> 28:40.050
You say you need this suit,
this pin, and this paper.

28:41.086 --> 28:43.253
I'll do you a deal.

28:48.093 --> 28:50.060
Fight me for them.

28:58.169 --> 28:59.503
Come on!

28:59.505 --> 29:01.305
I don't want to fight you.

29:01.307 --> 29:05.943
Oh, don't worry. I'll
let you warm up first.

29:05.945 --> 29:09.446
You think you deserve this more?

29:09.448 --> 29:11.915
- Prove it.
- We're on the same side.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.951
Prove you're worth more.

29:13.953 --> 29:15.786
- No, I won't.
- You fight me.

29:15.788 --> 29:18.222
- I'm not worth more.
- You fight me.

29:25.931 --> 29:28.065
Wanna kill me?
Wanna kill me?

29:28.067 --> 29:29.366
That's what a man does.

29:31.237 --> 29:34.204
Mr. Woodhull's cart.

30:08.406 --> 30:11.041
<i>Come around to the left, men!</i>

30:16.915 --> 30:19.817
No, he's the captive!

30:23.454 --> 30:25.222
There he is!

30:26.858 --> 30:30.360
Surrender! You are alone and outnumbered.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.999
<i>You were right, Mr. Woodhull.</i>

30:36.001 --> 30:38.502
<i>You Tory bastard!</i>

30:55.086 --> 30:58.255
It's over now.
You're safe.

30:58.257 --> 31:01.491
<i>Tough nut, that one.</i>

31:04.864 --> 31:06.563
Oh, it's a long story.
Too long.

31:06.565 --> 31:08.866
- Do tell, tell.
- Tell, tell.

31:10.336 --> 31:11.969
Very well, very well.

31:11.971 --> 31:14.238
You see, I, too, was once taken prisoner.

31:14.240 --> 31:17.174
Not long after I arrived in America

31:17.176 --> 31:20.077
during the defense
of Fort Saint-Jean.

31:21.312 --> 31:25.349
I took it upon myself to write
down everything that I saw...

31:25.351 --> 31:28.385
troop movements, gun placements.

31:28.387 --> 31:31.288
I even drew a detailed map
of the territory.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.090
You must be quite the artist.

31:33.092 --> 31:35.592
I dabble.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.527
My reports were sent to General Howe

31:37.529 --> 31:39.997
and, impressed with my initiative,

31:39.999 --> 31:41.465
he assigned me to a new post.

31:41.467 --> 31:46.169
So you see, I understand
the value of men in chains.

31:47.205 --> 31:50.674
Thus it falls to me
to interrogate our returned.

31:50.676 --> 31:52.676
Though I do prefer
to compare multiple accounts.

31:52.678 --> 31:55.412
That way, if something is suspect...

31:56.547 --> 31:59.182
it's easier to spot.

32:01.486 --> 32:05.255
As an artist, I've learned that
it's not always the big picture,

32:05.257 --> 32:09.993
but the little details that
effectively sell the tale.

32:09.995 --> 32:13.397
Another line of the old
author, Lieutenant Terrence?

32:17.568 --> 32:21.138
Lieutenant Terrence here
is a Coldstream man.

32:21.706 --> 32:27.277
I propose a toast for one
of Colonel Mathew's finest.

32:28.046 --> 32:29.613
<i>Nulli Secundam.</i>

32:32.417 --> 32:34.084
<i>Secundus.</i>

32:43.061 --> 32:44.661
What the hell have you done?

32:44.663 --> 32:46.964
This man's a liar.

32:48.366 --> 32:53.337
Coldstream lieutenant not
knowing his regiment's motto.

32:54.405 --> 32:57.207
He was likely sent back to us as a spy.

32:57.209 --> 32:59.209
I know that!

33:00.712 --> 33:03.246
You pale fool.

33:03.248 --> 33:04.748
I had planned on turning him double,

33:04.750 --> 33:07.451
the opportunity of which
I have now been robbed.

33:07.453 --> 33:10.721
I apologize, Major.
I just thought...

33:10.723 --> 33:12.422
You didn't think.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.491
You acted upon the assumption
that you were the only one

33:14.493 --> 33:17.494
who could spot a mouse in the cupboard.

33:17.496 --> 33:21.631
Has it really been that
long since your last kill

33:21.633 --> 33:25.268
or was violence your natural inclination?

33:30.708 --> 33:33.543
Go back to Setauket, Captain.

33:33.545 --> 33:38.015
I pray that woman can
settle your savage side.

34:04.375 --> 34:07.577
General, have we come to a consensus?

34:07.579 --> 34:11.547
Your Excellency, we believe
traditional reconnaissance

34:11.550 --> 34:13.116
is the way forward

34:13.118 --> 34:15.485
as it depends on as little
variable as possible

34:15.487 --> 34:19.156
and would be carried out by men who
could be trusted to follow orders.

34:21.292 --> 34:25.362
Captain, what say you?

34:26.531 --> 34:28.431
I...

34:28.434 --> 34:30.300
I concur with the general, sir.

34:32.804 --> 34:36.273
The chain of agents approach
would require trust

34:36.275 --> 34:41.610
and in that resource, I'm afraid
we find ourselves lacking.

34:44.748 --> 34:48.185
You're speaking now
of your men on Long Island.

34:48.187 --> 34:51.621
No, sir, I'm speaking
of the men in this room.

34:55.860 --> 35:00.397
Sir, for a conspiracy
like this one to function,

35:00.399 --> 35:02.232
we would need to be keeping secrets

35:02.234 --> 35:06.603
from the enemy, from Congress,
even from our own army.

35:06.605 --> 35:11.108
This would require absolute trust

35:11.110 --> 35:14.744
amongst the secret-keepers,
and yet General Scott here

35:14.746 --> 35:17.481
<i>does not trust me or my judgment.</i>

35:17.483 --> 35:20.283
<i>Mr. Sackett here mistrusts my experience,</i>

35:20.285 --> 35:22.352
<i>much as I mistrust his attitude</i>

35:22.354 --> 35:25.288
toward the lives
of the agents in the field.

35:25.290 --> 35:28.225
And you, sir...

35:29.160 --> 35:31.828
<i>you know the name Abraham Woodhull</i>

35:31.830 --> 35:34.664
and yet you will not disclose to me

35:34.666 --> 35:36.900
the source of your knowing.

35:36.902 --> 35:40.704
Apparently, you do not trust me either.

35:40.706 --> 35:43.373
Therefore, I cannot trust the success

35:43.375 --> 35:46.543
of any chain that we
might build here today.

35:54.652 --> 35:58.855
I would like to speak with
Captain Tallmadge alone.

37:03.788 --> 37:06.723
Hold!

37:10.795 --> 37:12.829
Shut your gobs!

37:17.401 --> 37:19.302
You still gonna kill me?

37:20.805 --> 37:24.774
Well, Rangers don't kill
their own initiates.

37:51.335 --> 37:53.770
Samuel Tallmadge.

37:54.839 --> 37:58.808
Samuel.

38:01.345 --> 38:06.049
Mr. Sackett tells me that you
prefer an alias for Woodhull.

38:06.051 --> 38:08.518
I must say, I concur.

38:08.520 --> 38:11.521
Forgive me, sir, but I
thought that we had agreed

38:11.523 --> 38:12.889
that the best way forward...

38:12.891 --> 38:14.691
You were right in your prescription.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.893
We require an amendment
in the name of trust.

38:16.895 --> 38:19.829
Following our retreat
from Brooklyn Heights,

38:19.831 --> 38:22.799
I tasked a native to
reconnoiter enemy encampments

38:22.801 --> 38:27.704
around Long Island and seek out
contacts friendly to our side.

38:27.706 --> 38:30.340
His name was Nathan Hale,

38:30.342 --> 38:33.877
and he was captured while
he was on a mission for me.

38:33.879 --> 38:37.314
He was hanged as a spy.

38:37.316 --> 38:39.683
Fortunately, his best friend at Yale,

38:39.685 --> 38:42.652
a certain Benjamin Tallmadge,

38:42.654 --> 38:45.422
spoke often of his hometown friends...

38:45.424 --> 38:51.094
a whaler named Brewster and
a farmer named Woodhull.

38:52.363 --> 38:55.432
I wrote those three names down on a report,

38:55.434 --> 38:59.336
a report I looked back on
when an unsigned letter

38:59.338 --> 39:03.106
sent by an anonymous farmer proved correct.

39:04.642 --> 39:09.612
Captain Hale died without
friends to support him.

39:09.614 --> 39:13.883
We cannot let that happen
to Mr. Culpepper.

39:13.885 --> 39:17.487
Mr. Culpepper?

39:17.489 --> 39:21.825
We'll never use the name Woodhull again.

39:32.603 --> 39:35.705
Why was he wearing your clothes?

39:35.707 --> 39:40.510
His aim was to pose as me,
escape into the city, I suppose.

39:40.512 --> 39:42.946
Right, and that proves
the general's anxieties.

39:42.948 --> 39:46.883
Can't take any more lone men into New York.

39:46.885 --> 39:49.753
What do you... you mean I can't continue on?

39:49.755 --> 39:52.455
Not alone.

39:54.059 --> 39:56.526
<i>He tell you his name?</i>

40:01.732 --> 40:03.466
No.

40:26.957 --> 40:31.828
Please don't think that I
condone such barbarism.

40:33.998 --> 40:36.966
Just...

40:36.968 --> 40:39.669
miss my boy, is all.

40:39.671 --> 40:42.872
You have a son?

40:42.874 --> 40:46.676
His birthday's comin' round.

40:46.678 --> 40:49.598
Well, then, we must send him something.

40:51.916 --> 40:54.017
If you think of a gift,
I'll make arrangements

40:54.019 --> 40:56.260
to have it sent by special courier.

41:00.758 --> 41:02.859
Well, there's that smile.

41:04.762 --> 41:07.697
That's good.
Good, good.

41:10.034 --> 41:12.969
<i>You are an
invaluable asset to me,</i>

41:12.971 --> 41:14.704
and so, General Scott, I feel it better

41:14.706 --> 41:18.842
to apply your acumen where it
is most needed... on the front.

41:18.844 --> 41:21.644
But, sir, a captain can't
run the intelligence branch.

41:21.646 --> 41:24.848
That's why I have promoted him to major.

41:27.685 --> 41:31.554
I wish you the best of
luck, Your Excellency.

41:40.898 --> 41:43.833
He is a fine general.

41:44.969 --> 41:48.638
Thank you for this promotion, sir.

41:48.640 --> 41:51.274
- I pray I do you proud.
- As do I.

41:51.276 --> 41:53.142
<i>Your first duty is to come up</i>

41:53.144 --> 41:56.913
with a given name
for our Mr. Culpepper.

41:59.850 --> 42:01.117
Samuel.

42:01.119 --> 42:03.820
In honor of your brother, I presume?

42:03.822 --> 42:05.755
Yes, sir.

42:05.757 --> 42:09.926
And might I ask, what is the
meaning of "Culpepper"?

42:09.928 --> 42:12.061
Excellent question.
