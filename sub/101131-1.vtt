WEBVTT

00:45.437 --> 00:46.906
You think they'd laminate it.

00:46.939 --> 00:48.641
Yeah, surely, the money we paid.

00:48.675 --> 00:49.676
I'm yet to pay.

00:49.709 --> 00:50.777
That's why
you're fleeing the country,

00:50.810 --> 00:52.577
so you don't have to pay back
your student debts.

00:52.611 --> 00:55.748
Yeah, suck a fat one,
Mr. Prime Minister.

00:55.782 --> 00:57.917
Yeah, I hear the underground
costs a fuckload over there Lou.

00:57.950 --> 00:59.418
Yeah, good luck.

00:59.451 --> 01:01.486
One liver in payment
for a pint of milk.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.355
You'll have to sell your organs.

01:03.388 --> 01:05.024
I'll go vegan.

01:05.058 --> 01:07.694
And it rains. All the time.

01:07.727 --> 01:09.294
Immigration is gonna
kick you out anyway.

01:09.327 --> 01:10.697
There's too many Australians
over there as it is.

01:10.730 --> 01:12.531
- And in every pub.
- In every school.

01:12.564 --> 01:15.902
- In every home.
- Jesus Christ, it sounds like propaganda community.

01:15.935 --> 01:17.837
Well, you're always
welcome back here.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.538
- To work in a pub.
- Uh, get fucked.

01:19.571 --> 01:21.339
I'm actually gonna use
my degree.

01:21.373 --> 01:22.975
You mean you didn't just
do it for the outfit?

01:23.009 --> 01:25.577
- Or the juicy dish?
- Shut up.

01:26.278 --> 01:27.780
You'll be running
News Corp in no time.

01:27.814 --> 01:29.381
I'll call you Mrs. Murdoch.

01:29.414 --> 01:30.650
No, thank you, Nina.

01:30.683 --> 01:32.417
- He's rich.
- And evil.

01:32.451 --> 01:33.585
My kind of man.

01:52.304 --> 01:54.406
You look like an idiot.

01:54.439 --> 01:56.042
At least I can take this off.

01:58.010 --> 01:59.912
- How does it feel?
- What?

02:00.545 --> 02:01.848
To graduate, idiot.

02:12.457 --> 02:14.593
Is there
any of that chicken left?

02:14.627 --> 02:15.762
I already ate it.

02:15.795 --> 02:17.395
You suck.

02:28.141 --> 02:32.344
- You think that they would...
- Laminate it. I know, right?

02:32.945 --> 02:35.648
Mm. I don't think
I'll ever go to uni.

02:35.681 --> 02:39.351
Shut up, you're in your 11th,
Phoebs, what do you know?

02:39.384 --> 02:41.954
Well,
I'm not in any kind of rush.

02:43.055 --> 02:45.624
What can you do with
a communications degree anyway?

02:45.658 --> 02:47.927
Communicate, idiot.

03:04.476 --> 03:05.443
What are you doing?

03:05.477 --> 03:07.579
Ravi, you need to get
the shit under control.

03:07.612 --> 03:08.580
What, the weeds?

03:08.613 --> 03:10.950
Yeah, the weeds.
It's like a jungle out here.

03:12.185 --> 03:13.753
I didn't really notice.

03:14.921 --> 03:16.889
Are you done?

03:41.681 --> 03:42.782
Sit up.

03:44.416 --> 03:45.517
Look into my eyes.

03:57.196 --> 03:58.430
Alice.

03:58.463 --> 03:59.632
Hmm?

04:00.900 --> 04:02.400
- Are you trying to hypnotize me?
- No.

04:04.070 --> 04:06.072
- This promotes connection.
- Oh.

04:11.911 --> 04:13.378
Why are we doing this?

04:15.014 --> 04:19.886
I think if everyone started their day like
this, people would be a lot more kind.

04:21.087 --> 04:23.055
Less selfish.

04:29.494 --> 04:34.834
You are you and I am me.

04:40.538 --> 04:45.044
Look, you're not wrong.

04:59.292 --> 05:01.160
My friend's going away.

05:02.261 --> 05:03.796
Louise, right?

05:05.131 --> 05:05.998
Yeah.

05:06.032 --> 05:06.933
Where is she going?

05:06.966 --> 05:08.566
London.

05:12.104 --> 05:14.206
I had a cousin hooked into the
whole living abroad thing.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.943
- In a pub?
- Yeah.

05:16.976 --> 05:18.878
My friend's getting a real job.

05:22.014 --> 05:23.282
Excuse me, snob.

05:23.316 --> 05:24.582
What? It's true.

05:28.087 --> 05:29.255
Did she like it?

05:31.757 --> 05:32.858
Yeah.

05:32.892 --> 05:33.893
Well, she never came back.

05:35.593 --> 05:39.098
- Did she die?
- No. She got married.

05:39.899 --> 05:41.634
- Idiot.
- Same thing.

05:52.812 --> 05:56.882
When are you gonna go somewhere,
hmm?

05:57.883 --> 06:00.252
- Now why would I do that?
- Ow!

06:01.287 --> 06:02.688
Fuck.

06:04.090 --> 06:07.293
You know, escape.

06:08.060 --> 06:11.831
See the world. All that shit.

06:12.932 --> 06:14.000
Hmm?

06:15.567 --> 06:17.903
Can't go anywhere my parents
haven't already been.

06:18.871 --> 06:20.106
So?

06:22.942 --> 06:25.011
Cheers for the drugs.

06:25.678 --> 06:27.680
Is that all I'm to you?

06:28.580 --> 06:30.149
Where did these come from?

06:30.883 --> 06:32.517
You caught me there, Al.

07:38.818 --> 07:40.219
Louise.

07:42.822 --> 07:44.290
- Louise.
- Yeah.

07:46.859 --> 07:48.761
What do you want for dinner?

07:50.196 --> 07:52.832
Don't know, unh... a curry.

07:53.299 --> 07:55.434
Well, I don't know
if you'll like Indian.

07:57.369 --> 07:59.205
I'll order some Thai.

07:59.238 --> 08:01.240
Why did you ask me then?

09:03.502 --> 09:05.371
Still at it then?

09:08.407 --> 09:10.075
Maybe I'll keep going later.

09:10.109 --> 09:11.443
Yeah, maybe.

09:16.749 --> 09:19.451
It's turning into
a long-term project.

09:25.191 --> 09:26.892
Did, find a school in L.A. yet?

09:26.926 --> 09:28.227
Yeah, as hoped.

09:29.895 --> 09:33.032
When my visa comes in, I'll probably just
head over and scout a couple of them out.

09:44.910 --> 09:47.379
Did you know that all this
used to be pineapple farms?

09:47.413 --> 09:50.382
You've been here
longer than me, mate.

10:55.981 --> 10:57.416
Do you remember moving here?

10:58.117 --> 11:00.319
- I was a baby.
- Hmm.

11:00.352 --> 11:01.820
I was about four.

11:03.188 --> 11:05.824
Remember poor old mom spent
days lugging boxes up and down.

11:06.859 --> 11:07.926
Where was dad?

11:07.960 --> 11:10.896
At work
moving his women's business.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.634
What was that old place like?

11:14.668 --> 11:17.903
I don't remember much.
It was... it was bigger.

11:19.038 --> 11:25.477
I don't know, I remember this woman
came once, she was so beautiful.

11:25.511 --> 11:31.383
She's very tall and she had this long hair
and I begged mom to tell me who she was.

11:31.417 --> 11:33.519
- Who was she?
- A real estate agent.

11:37.122 --> 11:39.325
And I cried so much when they
said we were leaving that place.

11:40.559 --> 11:41.460
Whatever.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.031
Ow!

11:48.500 --> 11:49.401
Get in the car.

11:52.639 --> 11:53.872
Hey, Phoebe.

11:55.374 --> 11:56.975
How long until you go?

11:57.009 --> 11:58.377
Ah, few more days.

11:58.410 --> 12:01.347
Shit.
Don't forget to say goodbye.

12:04.350 --> 12:06.118
Bye.

12:06.151 --> 12:08.253
When did your sister
get cooler than us?

12:33.680 --> 12:37.950
People will make fun of your
accent, like, all the time.

12:37.983 --> 12:40.085
That's okay, it's endearing.

12:40.619 --> 12:43.455
It's so cold,
the weather is awful.

12:47.025 --> 12:50.896
It's gonna take a lot more than bad
weather to make me want to come back.

12:52.965 --> 12:54.667
What's so bad about coming back?

13:55.561 --> 13:56.763
What's up?

14:04.704 --> 14:06.305
It's the posse.

14:09.374 --> 14:12.377
I was standing there.
I was crying.

14:12.411 --> 14:17.216
What's the point, it's like this old
fucking thing it's over, there's nothing.

14:17.249 --> 14:19.384
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:19.853 --> 14:21.086
You're up?

14:28.260 --> 14:29.328
Bottoms up.

15:06.465 --> 15:07.800
This stuff seems expensive.

15:08.768 --> 15:11.203
Courtesy of mom,
passed secret supply.

15:11.236 --> 15:12.604
It's very expensive.

15:13.238 --> 15:14.206
Hmm.

15:15.675 --> 15:17.644
All right. Pass it in.

15:21.113 --> 15:22.682
You okay?

15:22.715 --> 15:24.216
I don't know.

15:29.656 --> 15:31.490
Hey, Alice, can I borrow
some of your clothes?

15:31.523 --> 15:34.326
Oh, my God. Please.

17:22.935 --> 17:24.536
No way.

17:24.569 --> 17:26.338
But I was like,
anyway.

17:26.371 --> 17:28.808
- I don't care about you.
- You tend to lose.

17:39.618 --> 17:41.353
You know, I can stage.

17:45.658 --> 17:46.859
What is it?

17:46.893 --> 17:48.695
It's meant to be a bird.

17:49.662 --> 17:51.631
- Looks like a taco.
- Taco.

17:52.297 --> 17:54.332
Well, it fucking hurt.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.905
proper ink and stuff like that.

17:58.938 --> 18:02.240
- Do you draw?
- Yeah. Well, tattoo artists make heaps of money

18:02.274 --> 18:05.243
like going around the world
and drawing pictures on people.

18:05.277 --> 18:07.847
And when I get to LA,
I can actually like go to a proper school

18:07.880 --> 18:10.717
and study and... because
it's actually a fine art.

18:11.984 --> 18:13.953
You don't look like
you have many.

18:14.821 --> 18:16.388
I'm a blank canvas.

18:16.421 --> 18:18.557
Good luck with that.

18:20.059 --> 18:21.326
See you, Kane.

18:21.761 --> 18:22.995
See you.

18:26.699 --> 18:28.034
You gonna text me
when you get home?

18:28.533 --> 18:29.902
Alright, Dad.

19:25.892 --> 19:26.759
Sorry.

19:40.773 --> 19:44.509
I don't...
I don't usually wear this stuff.

20:10.569 --> 20:11.704
You okay?

20:14.406 --> 20:17.076
Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.

20:29.922 --> 20:31.924
No, keep... keep going.
Keep going.

20:31.958 --> 20:34.060
Whoa, what the fuck?

20:57.515 --> 20:58.450
Yeah, of course.

21:01.821 --> 21:04.023
I think I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go home.

21:04.056 --> 21:07.093
- I think I'm gonna go home now.
- Oh yeah? Where do you live?

21:07.126 --> 21:09.862
No. No, I'm gonna go home.

21:10.796 --> 21:12.999
What? Hey, come on.

21:13.833 --> 21:14.734
See you.

21:16.936 --> 21:20.405
- Whatever, bitch.
- See ya.

23:04.010 --> 23:07.146
Wake up sleepyheads,
it's lunchtime.

23:11.117 --> 23:13.686
Oh, mom, you shouldn't have.

23:13.719 --> 23:17.323
Oh, Lou! When did you
have time to do all this?

23:17.356 --> 23:21.193
You guys have been sleeping all day.
Pancakes take like ten seconds.

23:26.932 --> 23:28.600
Mm.

23:31.303 --> 23:32.671
Hm.

23:42.748 --> 23:46.719
Lou, this is like so beautiful,
but I think I'm gonna throw up.

23:47.987 --> 23:50.156
Just go slow then.

24:15.781 --> 24:18.784
<i>You have one new voice message.</i>

24:18.818 --> 24:21.287
<i>Hi, darling, congratulations!</i>

24:21.320 --> 24:23.889
<i>I hope you had a great
graduation yesterday.</i>

24:23.923 --> 24:27.993
<i>Sorry I couldn't be there,
but I've seen so many of these before.</i>

24:29.328 --> 24:31.831
<i>I can imagine what it was like.</i>

24:31.864 --> 24:34.366
<i>Anyway, keep everything
safe at home for us.</i>

24:34.400 --> 24:37.803
<i>You've got the credit card
for emergencies.</i>

24:40.005 --> 24:42.141
<i>Okay, darling, I have to go.
Love you.</i>

24:42.174 --> 24:44.110
<i>To callback pre...</i>

24:54.987 --> 24:57.289
Fuck. Phone's dead.

25:03.295 --> 25:04.463
There you go.

25:04.497 --> 25:07.133
What are we gonna do
without you, mum?

25:08.400 --> 25:11.303
You know I never really liked
you guys calling your mum.

25:12.204 --> 25:13.806
It's a term of endearment.

25:15.574 --> 25:19.145
I can't always be there to check that you've
gone to the toilet before you get in the car.

25:30.022 --> 25:33.192
Whoa,
someone shit in the pancakes?

25:33.225 --> 25:36.862
It's nothing.
I'll see you guys later.

25:36.896 --> 25:39.465
Oh, shit! Louise,
can I get a lift in with you?

25:40.966 --> 25:42.134
Sure.

25:43.135 --> 25:44.436
Hope you don't need a piss.

29:18.651 --> 29:20.119
Can you drive me into town?

29:21.019 --> 29:22.354
I've got
a lot of shit to do today.

29:22.388 --> 29:24.890
Please, you don't have
to drive me back.

29:25.991 --> 29:29.729
- Fine. Alice, are you coming?
- No, thanks.

29:37.737 --> 29:40.740
I didn't realize you hated
being called mom so much.

29:40.774 --> 29:44.644
It's just exhausting looking
after everyone all the time.

29:50.750 --> 29:52.652
That's fine. I like it.

29:52.685 --> 29:54.453
Then why'd you get so angry?

29:54.486 --> 29:56.355
You know, we only have you
for a few more days, Lou.

29:57.356 --> 29:59.425
So what? Now that I'm leaving,
I'm not allowed to get angry.

29:59.458 --> 30:02.027
Well, if that's how you want
us to remember you, sure.

30:03.529 --> 30:05.197
Oh, I'm sorry Nina.

30:05.230 --> 30:08.233
I didn't realize that our
friendship was so tenuous.

30:08.267 --> 30:10.469
Guess I shouldn't have put in
so much effort all these years.

30:10.502 --> 30:13.640
- Lou, I...
- No, you know I've got a lot of shit to do today,

30:13.673 --> 30:15.775
so I can't just be driving
you around all fucking day.

30:15.809 --> 30:17.009
Fine, I'll walk.

30:18.277 --> 30:19.945
Great.
I hope you can remember how.

30:48.440 --> 30:49.676
Ravi.

32:22.434 --> 32:24.069
Oi, you're bleeding.

32:25.705 --> 32:27.472
It's fucking gross, dude.

32:50.763 --> 32:52.765
Do you want your ball back?

33:09.548 --> 33:10.750
Fuck.

33:12.250 --> 33:13.653
What?

33:13.686 --> 33:15.688
I'm gonna fail and gonna be kicked
out of school and take up meth.

33:15.722 --> 33:17.422
Jesus.

33:17.456 --> 33:18.725
What are you
having trouble with?

33:18.758 --> 33:21.661
Earth geometry and time zones,
latitude, longitude.

33:24.429 --> 33:26.666
Well, good luck.

33:26.699 --> 33:28.233
Fucking useless.

33:28.266 --> 33:29.468
I try.

33:31.470 --> 33:33.205
Doing anything tonight?

33:33.238 --> 33:34.473
Another party.

33:34.506 --> 33:36.208
Cool.
What are you wearing?

33:37.777 --> 33:39.244
Can I borrow something?

33:40.713 --> 33:43.215
- I should be borrowing your clothes.
- You can if you want to.

33:43.248 --> 33:46.284
You dress like a dweeb
skater boy, but you don't skate.

33:46.318 --> 33:47.754
And?

33:50.522 --> 33:52.357
Fine, I'll see what I can do.

34:03.335 --> 34:05.270
So, what do you want me to do?

34:05.938 --> 34:09.206
I wanna look like one of those
fucked up American beauty queens.

34:09.241 --> 34:11.476
Like one of Donald Trump's
illegitimate children.

34:11.510 --> 34:13.445
- Like a drag queen?
- Yeah.

34:13.478 --> 34:17.248
Big hair, blue eyeshadow,
put it everywhere.

34:18.818 --> 34:21.553
- Is this a dress-up party?
- No.

34:21.585 --> 34:23.255
You're a freak.

35:17.844 --> 35:19.411
Perfect.

35:29.554 --> 35:31.724
- Fuck, is she?
- I don't know.

35:40.633 --> 35:43.069
Holy shit, is that Nina?

35:46.139 --> 35:49.742
Jesus Christ!
You look like Dame Edna.

35:49.776 --> 35:51.644
Hello, possums!

35:53.079 --> 35:55.380
Nina, you look insane.

36:00.019 --> 36:03.055
See you later.

36:03.089 --> 36:03.956
What?

36:09.028 --> 36:12.999
Hey, how long... how long
till this starts working? Sit.

36:13.032 --> 36:17.670
I don't know, like a few
minutes, maybe ten.

36:20.940 --> 36:25.645
Ooh, I feel like it's happening already.
My heart is racing.

36:25.678 --> 36:29.048
It's gonna be good.
I promise. It's really fun.

36:29.081 --> 36:32.752
Oh my... I just feel like I'm just
gonna be that girl that takes a bad pill

36:32.785 --> 36:37.422
and ends up like all over the news,
it's just like everywhere, you know.

36:37.957 --> 36:40.660
I just really don't wanna
die tonight, Alice.

36:40.693 --> 36:43.162
Like, do you... do you think maybe
I could just throw it up, like...

36:43.196 --> 36:45.397
Calm the fuck down, Louise.

36:47.767 --> 36:49.001
Fuck.

36:50.203 --> 36:53.639
Sorry. I'm off.

36:53.673 --> 36:56.175
What?
Where are you going?

36:56.209 --> 36:57.509
Oh, fuck.

37:05.818 --> 37:09.755
- Alice, I do not wanna die.
- You're not gonna die, mom.

37:15.795 --> 37:16.929
Hey, Alice.

37:17.864 --> 37:19.098
Hey.

37:22.534 --> 37:23.836
Am I gonna die?

37:24.737 --> 37:26.605
Uh, you look fine to me.

37:26.639 --> 37:28.841
- She just took her first pill.
- Oh, shit.

37:29.574 --> 37:32.912
You'll be fine. Just as long as you
didn't buy them off some dodgy dude.

37:33.813 --> 37:37.783
Dodgy... a dodgy dude.
Fuck.

37:40.019 --> 37:44.690
- It's Louise, right?
- Yeah. How did you know that?

37:48.194 --> 37:49.795
I must have seen you out.

37:55.067 --> 37:57.036
He was a nice man.

38:01.573 --> 38:03.608
Oh, ow!

38:49.155 --> 38:54.694
Oi, hey. Oi, dude. Are you a
friend of mine? Do you know me?

38:54.727 --> 38:57.129
Hey, we are friends, aren't we?
You know me, don't you?

38:58.764 --> 39:01.233
There it is.
I love that smile on you.

39:02.301 --> 39:03.535
What did you say?

39:03.568 --> 39:05.004
You got a nice smile on you.

39:06.672 --> 39:08.941
- You like that?
- Yeah.

39:15.848 --> 39:18.250
Oh, fuck!
What the fuck?

39:18.284 --> 39:21.887
- What did you fucking do?
- I'm sorry, you didn't like that.

39:21.921 --> 39:23.856
Would it be better if I smile?

39:26.359 --> 39:29.829
What did it taste like?

44:07.172 --> 44:08.874
You were quite something
last night.

44:08.907 --> 44:10.376
A goddess?

44:15.047 --> 44:17.549
Maybe you need to take a...
a break.

44:17.583 --> 44:20.319
Break from what, Lou?
All I'm doing is taking a break.

44:24.323 --> 44:25.557
Is that why
you're so together then?

44:26.191 --> 44:27.393
Can't you tell?

44:31.997 --> 44:35.467
Fine.
Maybe, a change of scenery.

44:36.869 --> 44:38.070
I'm scared of the beach.

44:39.673 --> 44:40.606
Why?

44:41.940 --> 44:44.510
I've seen what's in there.
I don't like it.

44:47.546 --> 44:48.547
The bush then.

44:49.348 --> 44:51.150
I did enough camping in school.

44:52.117 --> 44:54.953
Fine. Cabins?

45:02.494 --> 45:04.229
Looks like you're taking
the whole house.

45:07.399 --> 45:10.369
Well, mom and dad
are off to be grey nomads.

45:11.437 --> 45:14.406
Turns out they were counting down
the seconds until I graduated.

45:22.314 --> 45:24.416
Do you ever think about the
people that make those boxes?

45:26.985 --> 45:28.187
Almost constantly.

45:50.042 --> 45:51.276
Where were you last night?

45:52.010 --> 45:53.512
I just went for a swim.

45:58.584 --> 46:00.185
You didn't miss much.

46:02.689 --> 46:04.923
I was gonna do
a bunch up with a guy.

46:06.458 --> 46:07.393
I bit him.

46:09.595 --> 46:11.029
What, was he hitting on you?

46:11.563 --> 46:13.999
No. I don't know.

46:14.032 --> 46:16.703
He just really got
under my skin.

46:34.754 --> 46:38.123
So like what's the deal now that
you're a shining new graduate?

46:38.792 --> 46:40.959
Aren't you meant to have
employers falling all over you?

46:41.493 --> 46:44.563
What's that supposed to mean?
Everyone goes to uni.

46:49.769 --> 46:50.569
I didn't.

46:55.207 --> 46:57.943
Yeah, but you have L.A., right?

47:00.212 --> 47:01.547
When did you find out?

47:14.627 --> 47:16.261
Do I need to be worried?

47:26.673 --> 47:28.173
Fucking stupid.

47:43.322 --> 47:45.123
You look like a million dollars.

47:45.157 --> 47:46.592
Nah, I feel like a dollar fifty.

47:47.526 --> 47:49.461
Well, we're all going
on a little trip.

47:49.495 --> 47:51.029
Why?

47:51.063 --> 47:53.031
- I just booked it.
- What?

47:53.065 --> 47:54.399
When did you have time
to do that?

47:54.667 --> 47:56.168
When you were passed
out in the bathroom.

47:56.201 --> 47:58.537
- Oh.
- Sweet. How'd you pay?

47:58.570 --> 48:00.539
From my London savings.

48:01.774 --> 48:03.475
Don't worry, won't be missed.

48:04.376 --> 48:05.244
You're welcome.

48:05.277 --> 48:09.414
Guys, we can do this now.

48:09.448 --> 48:11.483
This is being an adult.

48:12.217 --> 48:14.586
I thought being an adult was
meant to be all the boring stuff.

48:14.620 --> 48:15.922
We are being kids.

48:15.955 --> 48:19.458
Yeah, kids with a driver's license
and a house in the country.

48:27.834 --> 48:29.234
Whatever.

50:09.969 --> 50:12.939
- Yeah.
- I didn't know they still made these.

50:12.972 --> 50:15.340
We were never allowed these
as kids.

50:15.808 --> 50:17.275
Why not?

50:17.309 --> 50:18.645
Phoebe had one in the car once,

50:18.678 --> 50:22.481
she stuck the gum under the seat,
and it is still bloody there.

50:22.514 --> 50:23.850
Fucking Phoebe.

50:25.885 --> 50:26.719
Mm.

50:27.654 --> 50:29.588
So how does it taste after
all these years?

50:32.391 --> 50:34.694
Great shit, to be honest.

50:44.937 --> 50:48.240
Fuck. My phone's dead.

50:49.341 --> 50:51.309
- Mine, too.
- Same.

50:51.343 --> 50:53.680
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!

50:53.713 --> 50:55.882
Sorry, Lou,
we didn't know we were coming.

50:59.451 --> 51:02.587
I've just canceled my plan,
so there's not much credit left.

51:02.621 --> 51:04.322
Only use it if we're desperate.

51:08.828 --> 51:11.396
Looks like we're doing it
the old-fashioned way.

51:28.815 --> 51:30.183
Do you even know
where you are going?

51:32.885 --> 51:35.454
- Roughly.
- Oh, great.

51:36.923 --> 51:38.725
You know this thing's from 2004.

51:38.758 --> 51:40.927
Look, it can't have
changed that much.

51:42.394 --> 51:44.797
Look, the guy at the server
said that we should go left.

51:44.831 --> 51:46.465
It's gonna take like
an hour off our trip.

51:48.101 --> 51:51.470
This is right. Left will take us literally
directly away from where we want to go.

51:51.503 --> 51:53.706
Yeah, but it's not like
that dude would lie.

51:53.740 --> 51:59.011
Unless he wants to send us somewhere secluded
and slaughter us all, pull an Ivan Milat.

51:59.045 --> 52:01.781
Okay, not so funny. You know
I'd be the first one to die.

52:02.481 --> 52:06.618
- I think we should go left.
- Fine. We'll go left then.

52:06.652 --> 52:08.054
Real adults.

52:43.355 --> 52:44.991
I don't know
where the fuck we are.

52:51.931 --> 52:55.433
- How much further?
- My bum's going dead.

53:03.976 --> 53:05.912
Fine, you drive.

54:11.210 --> 54:12.979
I think we are close.

54:13.779 --> 54:14.881
- Hi.
- Hello.

54:14.914 --> 54:17.750
Do you know the way to
Beacon Street? We're a bit lost.

54:17.783 --> 54:19.719
Yes, of course.
So you're almost there.

54:19.752 --> 54:23.022
You just go straight down the road
and take the right at the next lane.

54:23.055 --> 54:24.589
- Oh, great, thank you.
- You're welcome.

54:24.623 --> 54:26.893
Anything else
I can help you with?

54:29.128 --> 54:31.631
Yeah, how many nuggets
can I get for ten dollars?

54:36.102 --> 54:38.037
How many could I get
for twenty dollars?

54:57.657 --> 55:01.093
- Anything else I can get you?
- No, thank you.

55:27.552 --> 55:30.990
- This isn't too bad.
- This is great. Thanks, mum.

55:37.697 --> 55:41.233
- The country is terrifying.
- I think it's calming.

55:41.267 --> 55:44.170
- Something out there?
- Yeah, but you can't see.

55:45.104 --> 55:46.538
Shit.

55:49.574 --> 55:50.743
What's up?

55:56.916 --> 55:58.117
I'm gonna go for a walk.

58:38.777 --> 58:41.714
I think it's bullshit that
people don't believe in aliens.

58:44.483 --> 58:47.086
You have to be mad to think
we're the only ones.

58:51.290 --> 58:53.292
Do you think they can see us?

58:57.296 --> 58:59.899
I think they probably got
better things to do.

59:03.802 --> 59:07.106
- Well, do you want them to?
- No. No, I don't.

59:13.012 --> 59:14.146
Where is Lou?

59:14.980 --> 59:17.383
Inside. Sleeping.

59:22.488 --> 59:25.324
Um, it must feel good.

59:25.958 --> 59:27.059
Why?

59:28.761 --> 59:30.763
Just being so close.

59:32.798 --> 59:34.099
To leaving?

59:34.767 --> 59:40.072
To starting... something.

59:42.341 --> 59:43.909
You'd know though, right?

01:00:06.365 --> 01:00:07.833
Still sore?

01:00:09.235 --> 01:00:10.169
Yeah.

01:00:13.239 --> 01:00:16.442
Maybe wash the needle a bit
more next time.

01:00:17.509 --> 01:00:18.477
Yeah.

01:00:29.421 --> 01:00:31.857
This would all float away
if we were up there.

01:00:34.526 --> 01:00:35.928
So would we.

01:01:31.216 --> 01:01:33.352
- Oh, beat us to it.
- Down for a swim?

01:01:33.385 --> 01:01:34.219
Yeah.

01:01:43.228 --> 01:01:44.596
- Just like...
- Yes.

01:01:44.631 --> 01:01:46.498
Like, you know,
and everyone laughs.

01:01:46.532 --> 01:01:49.068
There... there was shrimp.
There was a lot more.

01:02:21.266 --> 01:02:25.604
I've never worn a bikini before, ever.

01:02:25.638 --> 01:02:27.573
- That's strange.
- Super strange.

01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:29.975
Not at all.
You're a good Catholic girl.

01:02:30.008 --> 01:02:32.712
None of that sinful flesh piece...
Oh, my God! Put it away.

01:03:06.011 --> 01:03:09.314
- What if you do that?
- I can't.

01:03:09.348 --> 01:03:11.016
No.

01:03:16.054 --> 01:03:18.290
Get on my shoulder.

01:03:26.498 --> 01:03:29.702
Hey, Lou. Are you always
in clothes in a bath too?

01:03:29.736 --> 01:03:31.370
Or in a shower?

01:03:31.403 --> 01:03:33.505
Get fucked,
you know what I mean.

01:03:44.818 --> 01:03:47.152
Does anyone have sunscreen?

01:03:47.186 --> 01:03:49.756
Lou, do you have sunscreen?

01:03:55.795 --> 01:03:57.730
For fuck's sake.

01:04:23.656 --> 01:04:25.424
What do you guys
feel like eating?

01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:32.564
Anybody?

01:04:34.801 --> 01:04:38.036
- What about pasta?
- Or a nice salad?

01:04:38.070 --> 01:04:38.805
Hmm.

01:04:42.541 --> 01:04:44.644
Make some decisions.
I'm not the parent here.

01:04:45.277 --> 01:04:47.379
What about pasta and a salad?

01:04:47.412 --> 01:04:50.382
- Or a pasta salad.
- Yeah.

01:04:53.218 --> 01:04:55.187
Well, you guys are idiots.

01:04:59.558 --> 01:05:02.494
- Where's Nina?
- She's in the car.

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:29.087
Nice jacket.

01:05:30.422 --> 01:05:31.456
Thanks.

01:05:57.951 --> 01:05:59.318
Do you wanna go for a walk?

01:06:03.422 --> 01:06:04.289
Yeah.

01:06:14.433 --> 01:06:16.101
- Is this yours?
- Yeah.

01:06:54.974 --> 01:06:56.341
So sweaty.

01:06:57.576 --> 01:07:00.412
It's fine. It's hot.

01:07:01.748 --> 01:07:03.348
- I am too.
- Hmm.

01:07:05.818 --> 01:07:08.453
- How do you feel?
- Good.

01:07:11.724 --> 01:07:15.560
- Okay.
- No, good, good. I feel good.

01:07:15.594 --> 01:07:18.998
My body feels good.

01:07:26.039 --> 01:07:27.740
What are you in town for?

01:07:28.373 --> 01:07:31.944
Oh, um, my friend's going away
for a really long time,

01:07:31.978 --> 01:07:35.715
so we're here
as a kind of her treat thing.

01:07:36.883 --> 01:07:38.316
Where is she going?

01:07:39.752 --> 01:07:45.390
To work for NASA.
She's becoming an astronaut, so.

01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:49.528
Cool.

01:07:49.561 --> 01:07:51.698
I mean, I wanted to go too.

01:07:51.731 --> 01:07:57.235
I mean, I'm qualified but there is only space
in the program, so I gave it up for her.

01:07:57.269 --> 01:07:58.705
- Noble of you.
- Yeah.

01:08:02.842 --> 01:08:05.778
Is that the girl you were with
the... the bag of pies?

01:08:05.812 --> 01:08:08.613
Yeah, that's Louise.

01:08:09.414 --> 01:08:10.615
Yeah. She's pretty.

01:08:28.433 --> 01:08:30.402
Uh, that was my first time.

01:08:32.638 --> 01:08:33.673
Ah.

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:37.810
Um. Thank you.

01:08:41.613 --> 01:08:44.015
No, I... I'm on it, honestly.

01:08:45.785 --> 01:08:50.255
I... I've done it with boys
before like loads.

01:08:50.857 --> 01:08:51.957
Sure.

01:08:53.457 --> 01:08:55.527
Have you ever had
proper sex before?

01:08:58.563 --> 01:08:59.799
Proper sex?

01:08:59.832 --> 01:09:00.733
Um...

01:09:02.902 --> 01:09:04.002
Um...

01:09:06.005 --> 01:09:07.073
I guess not.

01:09:16.581 --> 01:09:17.750
I should go.

01:09:17.783 --> 01:09:20.886
Yeah, that's cool. I actually
have to go to work anyway.

01:09:21.754 --> 01:09:23.555
You're not gonna shower first?

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:09.195
We should go and look for her.

01:11:11.230 --> 01:11:12.198
She'll come back.

01:11:13.099 --> 01:11:15.902
- She might be hurt.
- She'll come back.

01:11:15.935 --> 01:11:17.602
She doesn't know where we are.

01:11:19.005 --> 01:11:20.706
She doesn't even have
the address.

01:11:50.502 --> 01:11:52.138
Are you gonna get in
trouble with work?

01:11:54.173 --> 01:11:55.875
Maybe, I don't know.

01:11:57.643 --> 01:11:59.611
They knew I was gonna
be leaving anyway.

01:12:01.047 --> 01:12:02.782
You've been working there
forever.

01:12:03.916 --> 01:12:05.418
Yeah, since I was 14.

01:12:05.952 --> 01:12:07.653
That's a very long time.

01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:12.992
How much do you have saved up?

01:12:13.793 --> 01:12:15.460
About forty grand.

01:12:16.762 --> 01:12:18.664
Whoa, what the fuck!

01:12:20.066 --> 01:12:22.068
Oh, yeah. What do you think
I did with all my money?

01:12:22.101 --> 01:12:26.471
I don't know, just...
That's so much money.

01:12:27.306 --> 01:12:28.473
Yeah.

01:12:31.944 --> 01:12:33.379
You can still go to L.A.,
you know,

01:12:33.412 --> 01:12:37.283
just marry an old desperate lady and
you can get a Green Card that way.

01:12:40.653 --> 01:12:44.156
Yeah. I don't know if I'm
gonna go anywhere anymore.

01:12:45.825 --> 01:12:48.060
Oh. Why?

01:12:52.098 --> 01:12:53.299
I don't know.

01:12:56.035 --> 01:13:01.674
I think I'm just...
waiting for something.

01:13:06.312 --> 01:13:07.747
Waiting for what?

01:13:09.682 --> 01:13:11.117
To know what to do.

01:13:15.688 --> 01:13:18.290
You're gonna be waiting
a very long time for that.

01:13:29.201 --> 01:13:30.836
She better not be dead.

01:14:25.724 --> 01:14:27.259
Nina.

01:14:31.831 --> 01:14:32.898
Nina.

01:15:40.533 --> 01:15:42.101
Nina.

01:16:01.187 --> 01:16:02.888
Nina.

01:19:13.545 --> 01:19:16.882
You asked me the other day what
will be so bad about coming back.

01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:22.888
I don't know.

01:19:29.261 --> 01:19:31.463
I can't not go, you know.

01:19:34.166 --> 01:19:36.001
And Tess said
that I had to do it.

01:19:47.045 --> 01:19:49.047
You won't remember this,

01:19:49.081 --> 01:19:51.583
but there was this
geography assignment

01:19:51.617 --> 01:19:54.586
and you counted
all the countries in the world

01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:57.356
and then divided
that by the average lifespan

01:19:57.389 --> 01:20:00.392
just so you could figure out how
many days you could live in each.

01:20:00.426 --> 01:20:01.694
Yeah.

01:20:07.466 --> 01:20:09.401
What a little nerd.

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:16.676
You were never
gonna stay here, were you?

01:20:49.208 --> 01:20:50.309
What?

01:20:54.848 --> 01:20:58.617
Don't worry, I'm not moving in.

01:20:58.651 --> 01:21:01.153
I just got back, actually.

01:21:04.156 --> 01:21:05.491
Where did you go?

01:21:06.826 --> 01:21:09.261
Just away for a little while.

01:21:11.396 --> 01:21:13.265
It's really insane actually.

01:21:16.201 --> 01:21:20.606
So, you're stopping by at eight
in the morning, actually?

01:21:25.678 --> 01:21:27.112
Yeah, I guess.

01:21:32.184 --> 01:21:34.553
I just came to apologize, uh...

01:21:36.588 --> 01:21:41.059
All that bunch of weeds I left
on your doorstep the other day.

01:21:41.661 --> 01:21:44.062
Yeah, that was pretty lame.

01:21:53.605 --> 01:21:54.606
Do you want to come in?

01:22:00.112 --> 01:22:01.547
- Can I use your bathroom?
- Oh, my God.

01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:03.415
- I'm busting...
- Go on now, get in.

01:22:55.534 --> 01:22:56.803
How was it, hmm?

01:22:58.805 --> 01:23:01.506
- It was good?
- It was good.
