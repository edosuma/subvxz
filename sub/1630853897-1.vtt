00:46.166 --> 00:52.583
Fiction inspired by real events.

02:15.458 --> 02:22.458
Visby on the island of Gotland
Sweden, 1361

02:52.541 --> 02:59.791
MARGRETE
Queen of the North

03:08.083 --> 03:15.083
Hardangervidda
Norway, 1402

03:28.708 --> 03:33.625
Margrete I has gathered Denmark, Norway
and Sweden into a peaceful union

03:33.708 --> 03:39.083
which she single-handedly rules
through her adopted son, King Erik.

03:40.666 --> 03:48.208
For the first time in centuries, there
is peace between the Nordic countries.

05:15.708 --> 05:17.750
We created the Nordic Union together.

05:19.458 --> 05:22.333
We agreed and created it in peace.

05:23.916 --> 05:27.625
How was that possible, after
hundreds of years of bloody wars?

05:29.458 --> 05:32.875
It was because we believed that the
people of the North are connected.

05:32.958 --> 05:38.708
Peace, Your Majesty, we can agree on.
But now you want to assemble an army?

05:39.125 --> 05:40.833
Yes, Asle Jonsson.

05:41.333 --> 05:45.375
A Union Army so strong
the Germans won't dare to attack us.

05:48.333 --> 05:52.541
And in spring, my son, King Erik,
will be engaged

05:52.625 --> 05:54.666
to Princess Philippa of England.

05:56.375 --> 06:01.125
A Union Army will allow us to negotiate
a military alliance with England.

06:01.916 --> 06:04.875
No one will dare wage war against us.

06:04.958 --> 06:08.166
What do they ask in return?

06:09.458 --> 06:14.000
We don't need England.
Norway has always defended itself.

06:14.083 --> 06:18.375
Norwegian farmers against
German crusaders?

06:18.458 --> 06:20.708
You'll be slaughtered.

06:21.083 --> 06:26.000
Mr. Sparre. We just drove the Germans
out of Stockholm

06:26.083 --> 06:29.416
for you, if my memory
serves me right.

06:29.500 --> 06:34.916
As I remember it, Danish soldiers
drove the Germans out of Stockholm.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.416
- How many troops did you send?
- You call those dirty pirates troops?

06:39.500 --> 06:44.625
Gentlemen, please. Five years ago,
we created the Nordic Union together.

06:45.666 --> 06:50.250
We proved that we were able
to rise above the animosity of the past.

06:50.333 --> 06:51.791
And think of our people.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.250
We can do that again. Together.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.708
An army is expensive, Your Majesty.

07:03.833 --> 07:08.125
Peace has made us wealthy.
We've never been more prosperous.

07:15.833 --> 07:17.541
We have all experienced war.

07:21.125 --> 07:24.958
The brutality and destruction.

07:29.958 --> 07:31.583
In war, there are no winners.

07:32.833 --> 07:36.041
A Union Army will ensure peace.

07:42.041 --> 07:46.875
I will finance 400 soldiers
and the Church will provide 800.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.791
What does the Norwegian Council say?

07:56.625 --> 07:58.291
What does the Swedish Council say?

08:01.375 --> 08:02.666
The Danish?

08:12.375 --> 08:15.208
300 infantry, 50 cavalrymen,
100 archers.

08:16.458 --> 08:17.541
For peace.

08:20.333 --> 08:24.500
I can arm
100 infantry and 20 cavalrymen.

08:31.750 --> 08:35.000
200 infantry, 150 archers.

08:36.958 --> 08:38.125
For the Union.

08:46.625 --> 08:48.833
100 archers, 150 infantry.

08:51.541 --> 08:54.250
150 infantry.

08:56.458 --> 08:59.541
- 100 archers.
- 250 archers.

08:59.625 --> 09:00.791
200 infantry.

09:51.375 --> 09:56.166
Kullen in Scania
Denmark

10:05.708 --> 10:09.458
-Greetings, my Queen.
-Thank you, Roar.

10:09.958 --> 10:14.750
-I've brought the King with me.
-Greetings to you too, young King.

10:15.333 --> 10:19.500
-You've had a lucrative spring, I see.
-I can't complain.

10:19.583 --> 10:22.333
Nor can I, as long as
you stick to German ships.

10:22.958 --> 10:27.541
-A deal is a deal.
-I want to make a new deal.

10:28.750 --> 10:32.916
Visby. I want no ships travelling
to and from Gotland unscathed.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.833
-Especially the Germans.
-You want to close off Gotland?

10:37.208 --> 10:39.541
Yes, to keep the Germans out.

10:43.791 --> 10:45.541
You've taken female captives?

10:47.083 --> 10:49.541
The winter nights are long and cold.

10:52.333 --> 10:54.791
-She's coming with me.
-Pardon?

10:55.166 --> 10:59.250
Need I remind you of the Union's laws?
It's forbidden to rape women.

11:00.458 --> 11:01.833
The punishment is hanging.

11:04.125 --> 11:05.541
That applies to pirates, too.

11:09.791 --> 11:11.291
Fetch her.

11:16.416 --> 11:17.708
Where does she come from?

11:18.041 --> 11:19.916
You'll have to ask the Germans.

11:21.041 --> 11:24.625
She's Swedish,
but we found her aboard their ship.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.791
I'll take the girl,
and you'll seal off Gotland.

11:30.291 --> 11:31.875
Right away, my Queen.

11:33.208 --> 11:37.666
Roar? See if you can find a woman
who obliges out of her own free will.

11:38.333 --> 11:41.750
-It's very arousing, I've heard.
-Huh...

12:13.500 --> 12:16.625
-You're safe here.
-You can come with me.

12:33.250 --> 12:36.166
- God's grace to you, Peder.
- My Queen.

12:43.833 --> 12:45.291
That's a lot of soldiers.

12:47.458 --> 12:50.458
-And the Swedes gave the most?
-Yes. They were skeptical, as always.

12:51.583 --> 12:55.416
But Sparre is a smart man.
He rules his people well.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.166
We owe Sparre a debt of gratitude.

13:03.958 --> 13:06.875
I wish you had come with me
and seen all that I have seen.

13:09.250 --> 13:10.541
Everything is growing.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.708
Towns are flourishing. There is peace.

13:14.708 --> 13:16.083
Think of all you've achieved.

13:16.666 --> 13:20.458
We, Peder.
We did it together.

13:21.833 --> 13:23.875
Only you could have created the Union.

13:24.833 --> 13:29.083
But you had faith
when everyone else doubted me.

13:31.875 --> 13:34.333
Without your loans, they'd be right.

13:34.416 --> 13:38.416
We would have gone bankrupt
before I could unify anything at all.

13:39.333 --> 13:40.250
Yes...

13:42.166 --> 13:43.958
And remember, you still owe me.

13:44.666 --> 13:46.333
You don't give me a chance to forget.

13:52.375 --> 13:57.416
Kalmar, Sweden
three months later

14:13.666 --> 14:17.125
Where is Asle?
The head of Norway's Council?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.291
I haven't seen him.

14:30.916 --> 14:34.500
Princess Philippa of England
with entourage.

14:59.625 --> 15:03.750
What an honor it is to stand before
the famed Queen of the Nordic Union.

15:03.833 --> 15:06.958
The honor is ours entirely,
good Sir Bourcier.

15:07.875 --> 15:09.708
The King speaks a beautiful English.

15:13.375 --> 15:19.125
To all doting princes and noble knights,
may you be armed with courage.

15:19.208 --> 15:22.958
And to those who dedicate themselves
to love, all goodwill.

15:23.041 --> 15:27.208
And to all lovers learned in this art,
here and elsewhere

15:27.291 --> 15:29.791
to whom courage spreads.

15:29.875 --> 15:32.833
To all ladies of good standing
and beloved demoiselles

15:32.916 --> 15:36.041
to all honorable women,
wise, polite, agreeable

15:36.125 --> 15:40.875
I offer a humble recommendation of
loyal, true intention.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.333
What a lovely poem.

16:23.708 --> 16:24.541
Cheers!

16:36.416 --> 16:37.291
Astrid?

16:46.125 --> 16:47.375
Look at Raberlin.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.666
Our German trade envoy.

16:52.416 --> 16:54.916
His wine glass is still full.
What does that mean?

16:59.041 --> 17:00.500
It means the man is at work.

17:03.041 --> 17:04.375
So we keep our eyes open.

17:15.625 --> 17:17.375
Splendid ball, My Queen.

17:18.083 --> 17:19.416
Very exotic indeed.

17:20.083 --> 17:20.916
Yes.

17:36.541 --> 17:37.708
Astrid?

17:40.666 --> 17:41.875
I was just wondering...

17:43.875 --> 17:45.083
You're Swedish, right?

17:48.541 --> 17:50.750
It doesn't matter where we come from.

17:50.833 --> 17:53.500
We're all God's dandelion seeds,
carried off by the wind

17:55.000 --> 17:56.916
until we land on foreign fields.

17:59.958 --> 18:01.583
And bloom.

18:26.250 --> 18:27.541
- Sparre!
- My King.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.250
What a celebration!

18:33.791 --> 18:35.625
Now you're to be engaged with England?

18:37.500 --> 18:40.250
We've got to scare the Germans
out of our back garden.

18:41.041 --> 18:44.541
Since the Swedish Council can't manage,
we've got to step in.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.166
Let's not spoil the party with politics.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.333
I presume Your Majesty has other
commitments this evening.

18:56.916 --> 18:57.833
Your Majesty.

18:59.166 --> 19:03.250
Why is the head of Norway's Council
late to the King's engagement ball?

19:03.333 --> 19:05.916
My apologies.
I came straight from Graudenz.

19:10.125 --> 19:11.666
Go ahead, Asle.

19:13.916 --> 19:15.500
I met a man there.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.041
-A Norwegian.
-A Norwegian in Graudenz?

19:22.000 --> 19:25.041
It was Oluf. King Oluf.

19:29.208 --> 19:30.833
-My son?
-Yes.

19:36.041 --> 19:40.583
-Asle, my son is dead.
-Your Majesty, I saw him.

19:42.333 --> 19:44.083
Oluf died 15 years ago.

19:44.625 --> 19:47.750
I saw my King. Oluf is alive.

19:49.958 --> 19:52.833
- Where is this man?
- I brought him with me.

19:54.583 --> 19:58.750
-Is he here?
-No, at the inn in Smedby with my men.

20:00.916 --> 20:04.583
- Who knows of this?
- Only you and my men.

20:06.458 --> 20:11.958
Do you think it's a coincidence that
this man appears tonight of all nights?

20:12.041 --> 20:16.791
-All I know is that my King is alive.
-You're being used as a pawn.

20:17.375 --> 20:20.000
By the Teutonic Order,
in an attack against us.

20:23.416 --> 20:26.416
I stand here with eyes open,
baring my heart.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.833
- Yes, Malin?
- Your Majesty, the dance is beginning.

20:34.958 --> 20:36.041
I'm coming.

20:37.833 --> 20:41.291
-If you saw him, you'd understand...
-Asle.

20:43.416 --> 20:46.541
-Bring him. I'll see him tomorrow.
-Your Majesty.

20:47.750 --> 20:49.458
But don't mention this to anyone.

20:49.541 --> 20:52.333
-Your lips are sealed.
-Of course.

20:52.916 --> 20:56.708
-Allow me to get rid of the man.
-We can't ignore Asle's request.

20:56.791 --> 20:59.750
Norway has just pledged more than
1,000 men to the Union Army.

21:00.958 --> 21:04.708
-I fear this will get out of hand.
-I'm not afraid of anything.

21:49.333 --> 21:52.125
There's rumors your son Oluf
has appeared in Prussia.

21:52.208 --> 21:53.208
Are they true?

21:54.666 --> 21:56.916
Excuse me for asking,
but who told you this?

21:58.458 --> 22:00.041
Frankly, everyone is talking about it.

22:16.166 --> 22:17.958
Surely you don't listen to gossip.

22:27.375 --> 22:29.000
Eat now. It will be a long night.

22:30.541 --> 22:35.333
-People claim it's her real son?
-Her only son, who died. King Oluf.

22:36.833 --> 22:41.583
-The Queen's only son? She has Erik.
-He's adopted. From Pomerania.

22:42.625 --> 22:44.000
He's her sister's grandson.

22:46.583 --> 22:47.458
Look down.

22:49.791 --> 22:53.750
We've had plenty of whores.
They get sent packing. Eat.

22:55.000 --> 23:00.875
-Rumor says she killed Oluf herself.
-Her own son? Why?

23:01.916 --> 23:04.875
Power. He grew up
and wanted to be in charge.

23:05.750 --> 23:08.583
But she would never do that.
The Queen isn't like that.

23:12.458 --> 23:15.250
Poor man, turned around
and run after the girl.

23:18.666 --> 23:20.666
Thank you. Excuse me.

23:21.583 --> 23:26.958
Honorable Queen, permit
a humble servant to ask a question.

23:27.875 --> 23:28.916
Of course.

23:29.875 --> 23:33.750
Any news on the events in Graudenz?

23:35.666 --> 23:40.041
-Which events, dear Elvar?
-The ones everyone is speaking of.

23:41.250 --> 23:45.125
That our dear deceased King Oluf
is not in fact dead.

23:59.458 --> 24:02.250
I can assure you
that my son Oluf is dead.

24:03.916 --> 24:09.791
A Prussian man claiming to be my son
is treason against the Union.

24:09.875 --> 24:11.708
Is it true that he's here now?

24:16.750 --> 24:18.000
He's on his way.

24:20.666 --> 24:24.291
He will receive a fair trial,
as the Union's rules state.

24:24.875 --> 24:29.666
Everyone is welcome tomorrow.
But let us not waste more time.

24:29.750 --> 24:32.666
Let's celebrate my son
King Erik's engagement. Cheers!

24:41.333 --> 24:43.416
A virelai, please!

24:48.500 --> 24:52.375
-A public hearing?
-Everyone knows. I have no choice.

24:52.791 --> 24:55.500
-What's going on?
-Someone is out to get us.

24:56.333 --> 24:58.250
They don't know who they're up against.

25:06.166 --> 25:07.958
Ask Jacob to keep
an eye on Raberlin.

25:16.375 --> 25:18.375
It appears Your Majesty
has her hands full.

25:18.958 --> 25:20.166
Always.

25:22.916 --> 25:24.750
-It's late.
-Your Majesty.

25:27.083 --> 25:29.583
Allow me to escort you
to the Queen's chambers.

25:30.708 --> 25:34.041
It would be the perfect inclusion
to an already unforgettable night.

25:39.625 --> 25:45.083
If you escort me to my chambers tonight
I will be regarded as a whore.

25:45.916 --> 25:46.750
The Queen says,

25:46.833 --> 25:50.583
if you escort her to her chambers,
she will be seen as whore by sunrise.

25:51.083 --> 25:54.833
Or a witch
who copulates with the Devil Himself.

25:55.375 --> 25:59.041
Or a witch
who copulates with the Devil Himself.

26:07.208 --> 26:11.208
I look forward to starting
our negotiations, dear Bourcier.

26:28.416 --> 26:31.000
As for the dowry,
I believe you have received our offer.

26:32.083 --> 26:32.916
Yes.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.666
And give or take one or two
minor exceptions, it seems acceptable.

26:36.750 --> 26:38.500
Acceptable? That's splendid.

26:38.583 --> 26:40.583
We have reservations obviously.

26:40.666 --> 26:44.375
But all in all, when it comes to
the financial aspects we're very flexible.

26:45.333 --> 26:46.500
You are flexible.

26:47.166 --> 26:50.666
And in return, I believe you need
us to be flexible in other aspects?

26:51.250 --> 26:52.541
Well...

26:53.208 --> 26:54.458
Let's not play games.

26:55.458 --> 26:58.375
You have an agenda beyond money
and property for your King.

26:58.833 --> 27:00.375
Go on, you can tell me.

27:00.458 --> 27:01.666
Maybe Your Majesty is right.

27:02.333 --> 27:05.041
But I do sense that she too
has an agenda of her own.

27:06.416 --> 27:07.458
Very well.

27:08.625 --> 27:11.333
We want a military alliance
with England.

27:11.416 --> 27:14.958
If England is attacked,
we step up immediately and vice versa.

27:15.541 --> 27:16.541
That's negotiable.

27:16.791 --> 27:18.166
Now tell me what you want.

27:18.250 --> 27:20.375
My King wants hereditary rights
for his daughter.

27:21.250 --> 27:23.000
- Absolutely not.
- Excuse me?

27:23.375 --> 27:26.833
I will not be compromising
the future of the Nordic Dynasty.

27:27.416 --> 27:30.125
If King Eric, god forbid, falls ill

27:30.208 --> 27:34.708
I will under no circumstances hand over
the Nordic Union to the King of England.

27:40.375 --> 27:42.166
That's not a very respectful response.

27:42.875 --> 27:45.083
It's not a very respectful proposal.

27:48.291 --> 27:51.041
I'm sorry but these negotiations
will be very difficult

27:51.125 --> 27:53.666
if we don't get anything in return
for a military alliance.

27:53.750 --> 27:55.375
We will return the favor.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.458
We will return it in abundance.

28:00.375 --> 28:02.333
-Trust me.
-Trust?

28:03.250 --> 28:04.541
That's quite a word just now.

28:05.125 --> 28:06.333
What do you mean?

28:08.375 --> 28:10.333
Here we are negotiating
the marriage of a king

28:10.416 --> 28:13.250
whose predecessor might
suddenly still be alive.

28:15.083 --> 28:16.958
That you don't need to worry about.

28:17.500 --> 28:19.583
King Erik is unchallenged.

28:20.416 --> 28:22.041
Not if you ask the Norwegians.

28:25.250 --> 28:27.541
Well, I don't.

28:43.250 --> 28:48.458
The German man and the head
of Norway's Council, Asle Jonsson.

29:29.333 --> 29:32.750
Gentlemen, welcome to Kalmar.

29:41.791 --> 29:43.208
Permit me to ask your name.

29:48.541 --> 29:50.000
You know it.

29:58.375 --> 29:59.458
And you are?

30:01.458 --> 30:03.791
I am King Oluf Håkonsen.

30:13.500 --> 30:16.208
Please repeat that
with your hand on the Holy Bible

30:16.291 --> 30:18.541
in the name and hearing
of God the Almighty.

30:21.125 --> 30:22.250
What is your name?

30:24.541 --> 30:27.416
I am King Oluf Håkonsen.

30:31.875 --> 30:32.958
Your Majesty.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.458
Do you recognize this man?

30:46.416 --> 30:47.541
Is this your son?

30:55.166 --> 30:57.625
My son died in 1387.

31:00.166 --> 31:01.166
Your Majesty.

31:03.041 --> 31:04.625
It is my King
I see standing there.

31:11.791 --> 31:13.291
Order!

31:15.833 --> 31:21.916
- Asle, sit down.
- Is the Union not merciful and just?

31:22.958 --> 31:25.791
Listen before you send him
to the gallows.

31:25.875 --> 31:27.125
We've heard enough.

31:27.583 --> 31:30.083
The Queen has spoken.
A mother knows her son.

31:31.291 --> 31:33.458
Tell them about Esge Vind.

31:37.791 --> 31:40.916
Tell them about the summer of 1387.

31:49.125 --> 31:50.458
The sun was shining.

31:51.750 --> 31:54.916
I-- I was travelling through Scania.

31:58.291 --> 32:00.083
The wheat fields...

32:01.791 --> 32:03.250
You were in Ystad...

32:04.750 --> 32:08.000
...trying to convince the Swedish
Council to choose me as King.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.083
Do you remember?

32:11.250 --> 32:15.041
- Tell them what happened at Falsterbo.
- Asle. I must insist.

32:15.125 --> 32:19.000
I felt ill after the banquet.
I shouldn't have drunk the wine.

32:19.666 --> 32:24.458
My taster felt fine, but I was dizzy
and wanted to go to my room.

32:24.541 --> 32:27.666
- Then Esge came. Esge Vind.
- Esge Vind?

32:27.750 --> 32:31.791
Yes. He was afraid.
He had been ordered to kill me.

32:31.875 --> 32:37.125
Esge Vind, who's dead and
cannot deny this absurd story?

32:37.208 --> 32:38.458
How convenient.

32:42.916 --> 32:45.000
Who ordered Esge Vind to kill you?

32:48.416 --> 32:49.625
I don't know.

32:50.708 --> 32:55.000
Why are we listening to this swindler?
The Queen has spoken.

32:55.583 --> 33:00.541
Esge Vind was unable to kill the King,
Jens Due. So he brought him with him.

33:00.625 --> 33:03.250
- Brought him where?
- I was chained...

33:04.333 --> 33:05.791
I was chained...

33:09.500 --> 33:11.916
There was... a spider.

33:14.208 --> 33:15.125
I had a...

33:18.208 --> 33:20.458
Everyone's looking at me.

33:22.458 --> 33:23.458
I--

33:27.791 --> 33:30.166
- It was dark...
- Go on.

33:34.791 --> 33:37.916
- They were speaking German.
- Germany?

33:38.875 --> 33:39.750
Yes.

33:39.833 --> 33:46.083
<i>Ich bin auf einem Steinboden
aufgewacht. In einem... Kloster.</i>

33:47.083 --> 33:51.166
Now he's speaking German.
You all heard it. He's German.

33:51.250 --> 33:53.875
I haven't spoken Norwegian
in a long time.

33:53.958 --> 33:56.041
The King was imprisoned
for 15 years, Jens Due.

33:56.125 --> 33:57.333
What is this...?

33:58.416 --> 34:01.208
You must remember who I am! Or what?

34:01.291 --> 34:06.666
-Quite the dramatic flair, I must say.
-Look at him. Listen to him.

34:06.750 --> 34:09.375
-You know who I am!
-I've heard enough from that swindler.

34:09.458 --> 34:15.541
Careful, Jens Due. In front of you sits
the Queen and there is King Oluf.

34:15.625 --> 34:20.583
The only true King is sitting
on that throne right there!

34:20.666 --> 34:23.791
Who is he?
Tell me.

34:24.708 --> 34:26.041
Who is sitting on my throne?

34:28.458 --> 34:29.791
Who are you?

34:35.250 --> 34:37.416
You were captured, you say.

34:38.958 --> 34:40.416
How did you get away?

34:42.875 --> 34:46.250
A man came. He freed me.

34:46.333 --> 34:47.625
What man?

34:52.416 --> 34:54.666
It was dark...

34:56.000 --> 34:58.458
I don't know.

34:58.541 --> 34:59.958
He disappeared.

35:13.250 --> 35:15.625
The man disappeared.
Then what did you do?

35:17.916 --> 35:22.708
I was... I was dropped...
I was dropped off at an inn.

35:23.708 --> 35:26.041
That was how I found my King.

35:36.125 --> 35:37.958
The hearing will continue tomorrow.

35:50.208 --> 35:51.625
Why didn't you sentence him?

35:52.750 --> 35:56.583
A king doesn't leave his throne room
like a sulking child.

35:56.666 --> 36:00.583
-He claims he's the King.
-I need to get to the bottom of this.

36:00.666 --> 36:05.000
-Do that after he's been hanged.
-His presence alone stirs chaos.

36:11.500 --> 36:12.958
May we be alone?

36:14.625 --> 36:16.750
-Mother...
-That wasn't a question.

36:24.625 --> 36:30.375
-Since when do you contradict me?
-Our negotiations are at stake.

36:30.458 --> 36:35.666
We aren't tyrants. We won't hang a man
whose identity we don't know.

36:35.750 --> 36:41.500
-Still, we need to think of the Union.
-That's what I'm doing.

36:41.583 --> 36:45.250
I have to find out who our enemy is
before we kill our only witness.

36:51.916 --> 36:55.083
I was in Ystad. Remember?
He was so close.

36:56.875 --> 36:59.250
But I rode on.
I never saw him dead.

37:02.750 --> 37:07.500
You had to move on.
We needed to assemble the Council.

37:07.583 --> 37:11.916
The nation needed a regent.
Otherwise, it would all collapse.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.291
But I never saw him.

37:14.458 --> 37:20.083
You could have stepped down, with your
dead son, and watched it all crumble.

37:28.666 --> 37:30.666
You gave him a beautiful burial.

37:34.000 --> 37:34.916
Yes.

37:47.375 --> 37:49.875
-Everything all right, Your Majesty?
-Yes, Sparre.

37:51.250 --> 37:54.125
-Did you enjoy the performance?
-No, I had enough.

37:55.458 --> 37:56.833
Too much talk for my taste.

38:00.666 --> 38:04.250
<i>The carriage is ready.
The chest will be loaded now.</i>

38:10.708 --> 38:11.625
Oh, no.

38:12.875 --> 38:15.083
Maybe we should just let him go.
Let things settle.

38:16.458 --> 38:18.166
-Is everything in order?
-Yes sir.

38:21.708 --> 38:24.625
-William, my dear sir.
-Your Majesty.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.333
I think we ought to postpone
our negotiations

38:28.416 --> 38:29.958
until you have your dynasty in order.

38:31.041 --> 38:32.041
Don't leave.

38:33.500 --> 38:36.250
I cannot expose the princess to this mess.

38:36.333 --> 38:37.583
Let alone her father.

38:38.666 --> 38:41.708
Naturally, I will express my
gratitude generously

38:41.791 --> 38:43.291
if only you would stay a few days.

38:44.541 --> 38:46.416
If you need land, we'll find it.

38:47.625 --> 38:49.166
If you need money, we'll pay it.

38:51.125 --> 38:53.291
You will not regret it
if you stay, dear sir.

39:03.125 --> 39:04.166
Five days.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.875
May God bless you, Bourcier.

39:08.958 --> 39:09.958
We'll see.

39:16.583 --> 39:17.625
Erik!

39:18.833 --> 39:22.916
I know it's hectic,
but you don't need to worry.

39:23.625 --> 39:25.583
- I promise you--
- Your Majesty.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.083
Raberlin has gone.

39:30.750 --> 39:31.750
He's gone?

39:33.833 --> 39:35.041
To Germany.

39:42.375 --> 39:46.500
You have to go. Find out
what Raberlin knows about this.

39:47.875 --> 39:50.541
-Find Roar.
-Roar?

39:50.625 --> 39:56.083
-The pirate. Bring him along.
-The pirate? Roar the pirate?

39:56.500 --> 39:59.875
You're going to Germany.
You'll need him, Jacob.

40:04.583 --> 40:06.250
Raberlin has gone.

40:08.041 --> 40:11.000
-Is he behind all this?
-Not on his own.

40:11.083 --> 40:13.166
-With the Germans?
-Perhaps.

40:40.791 --> 40:45.041
- Good evening. Are you lost?
- I wish I were.

40:51.791 --> 40:54.416
-What does it say?
-Can't you read?

41:01.791 --> 41:07.208
Your Queen asked me to bring you
to Germany to find a German traitor.

41:09.916 --> 41:12.875
-Us two?
-I'm afraid so.

41:12.958 --> 41:14.750
I'm not going to bloody Germany.

41:17.541 --> 41:20.791
Then you are defying your Queen,
and I will kill you.

41:23.875 --> 41:26.791
You're planning to ride straight
into the Teutonic Order?

41:28.208 --> 41:31.000
For what? To be hanged?

41:31.083 --> 41:32.291
For my Queen.

41:35.250 --> 41:38.000
It's a long ride.
Can a pirate's ass handle it?

41:41.083 --> 41:42.250
I guess we'll see.

42:05.250 --> 42:08.750
-Astrid?
-Yes, Your Majesty?

42:09.833 --> 42:13.750
-Have you settled in?
-Yes, Your Majesty. Thank you.

42:16.875 --> 42:20.750
I want you to serve in the King's
chambers and tell me how he's doing.

42:30.458 --> 42:33.500
-You may go.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

42:36.375 --> 42:39.291
-Goodnight.
-Sleep well, Your Majesty.

44:26.083 --> 44:28.541
- Pardon me.
- No, stay.

44:38.041 --> 44:41.125
"Like dandelion seeds,
carried off by the wind..."

44:42.125 --> 44:43.458
I guess I was a bit...

44:45.125 --> 44:47.041
poetic that evening.

44:49.750 --> 44:50.833
And drunk.

44:54.666 --> 44:55.833
But you're right.

45:00.250 --> 45:01.750
Both of us were brought here.

45:16.500 --> 45:18.000
I'm from Pomerania.

45:19.625 --> 45:20.833
My name was Bugislav.

45:22.666 --> 45:27.250
But when my mother brought me here,
she named me Erik

45:28.291 --> 45:31.791
so the Swedes would love me
and make me their King.

45:36.041 --> 45:36.875
Funny, isn't it?

46:29.541 --> 46:31.083
Won't you eat with me?

47:30.666 --> 47:34.375
-You summoned a meeting?
-I need to know what happened.

47:35.041 --> 47:39.125
-They already told us.
-Why didn't we discuss this first?

47:40.625 --> 47:42.708
- Gentlemen.
- Your Majesty.

47:48.541 --> 47:53.666
-What is this about?
-You were with Oluf the day he died.

47:53.750 --> 47:56.041
- May he rest in peace.
- Yes.

47:58.125 --> 48:01.291
I ask you to tell me
exactly what happened.

48:10.250 --> 48:11.333
He fell ill?

48:12.833 --> 48:18.166
After the banquet, he turned pale and
nearly fell over when he stood up.

48:20.166 --> 48:21.791
The taster felt nothing.

48:23.666 --> 48:26.750
-Go on.
-He got a fever and fainted.

48:27.708 --> 48:31.375
Two days later, Esge Vind reported
that the King was dead.

48:34.416 --> 48:39.541
-Who treated him those two days?
-Esge Vind's servants.

48:42.541 --> 48:43.791
Was a physician called?

48:47.541 --> 48:51.291
No? Why didn't you demand
a physician?

48:51.375 --> 48:55.541
The Plague, your Majesty.
We were denied access.

48:56.083 --> 48:57.458
It was for fear of contagion.

48:57.541 --> 49:02.541
-Your King was on his deathbed.
-Are you suggesting we were involved?

49:02.625 --> 49:06.291
I'm trying to find out what happened
the day my son died, Jens.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.333
Who saw the King
before he was laid in the coffin?

49:15.416 --> 49:21.750
We feared the Plague, Your Majesty.
We trusted Esge Vind.

49:21.833 --> 49:25.041
-So no one saw him dead?
-That sounds like an accusation.

49:27.583 --> 49:29.791
In the middle of an absurd situation

49:29.875 --> 49:34.000
caused by a mother who cannot
recognize her own child.

49:34.083 --> 49:35.458
I had one son.

49:37.791 --> 49:39.000
How many do you have?

49:40.291 --> 49:44.250
I doubt you can recognize all the
bastard children you've left behind.

50:02.541 --> 50:05.875
You let my son die
right in front of you.

50:07.333 --> 50:08.791
And you did nothing.

50:26.375 --> 50:27.625
You're losing focus.

50:27.708 --> 50:31.166
-Your anger should help, not hinder you.
-One more time!

50:41.458 --> 50:44.708
I understand your frustration. But
surely the Queen doesn't believe him.

50:45.291 --> 50:47.416
-I'm her real son.
-Naturally.

50:51.791 --> 50:54.375
Your Majesty. Sparre.

50:55.250 --> 50:58.125
Glad to see
the King practicing his battle skills.

50:59.500 --> 51:02.875
-Was that all Jens Due came to say?
-I've come to express my sympathies.

51:06.041 --> 51:07.208
On what occasion?

51:08.000 --> 51:13.916
The throne room. No one deserves such
humiliation, least of all a great king.

51:19.250 --> 51:25.125
Thanks for the sympathy, but I doubt
that's what brought you down here.

51:25.208 --> 51:30.250
The Queen seems obsessed with
the thought that Oluf isn't really dead.

51:31.916 --> 51:34.375
I suggest you leave the gossip
to the maids.

51:34.458 --> 51:38.791
In a way, I understand the Queen.
It's terrible to lose a child.

51:39.875 --> 51:42.791
Fortunately,
she quickly found a new son.

51:46.291 --> 51:49.291
But it must make you feel
a bit insecure.

51:50.791 --> 51:53.500
How easily she replaced
her true-born son.

51:54.375 --> 51:56.333
Couldn't she just as easily replace you?

52:05.250 --> 52:07.291
Should I believe my mother?

52:08.375 --> 52:11.250
The greatest and most pious regent
the North has ever known?

52:12.791 --> 52:19.208
Or a Danish nobleman known for
his greed and scheming?

52:20.625 --> 52:22.541
It's a difficult choice, Jens Due.

52:24.041 --> 52:29.208
Think about it, Your Majesty.
My offer to help remains standing.

52:39.458 --> 52:41.208
Anger, Your Majesty.

52:44.916 --> 52:46.333
Use your anger.

52:46.416 --> 52:49.291
My mother and Peder told me
never to trust the nobles.

52:50.791 --> 52:51.625
I'm a noble.

52:53.541 --> 52:54.375
Come on...

53:02.333 --> 53:05.750
When you saw Oluf,
what did you think?

53:07.166 --> 53:09.833
-Margrete...
-No one saw him dead.

53:12.416 --> 53:14.500
I know you still grieve.

53:16.125 --> 53:18.458
But someone
is trying to take advantage of you.

53:19.666 --> 53:22.500
Someone wants to obstruct
the alliance with England.

53:24.833 --> 53:25.916
I cannot kill him.

53:31.666 --> 53:36.875
-We could smuggle him to Bergen.
-You just began a public hearing.

53:37.833 --> 53:43.416
All of Europe is watching. Wouldn't
it be suspicious if he disappeared?

53:44.500 --> 53:47.958
And what about the Norwegians?
What will they do? And Bourcier?

53:48.458 --> 53:53.333
You and Erik have the support of the
entire North. And the people's trust.

53:58.041 --> 53:59.750
Do you want to throw that away?

54:00.916 --> 54:03.458
No. But this makes me weak.

54:04.250 --> 54:05.166
Yes.

54:06.958 --> 54:12.833
Prussia
State of the Teutonic Order

54:17.000 --> 54:18.666
Remember this is enemy territory.

54:25.333 --> 54:27.833
The horses aren't warm.
Raberlin isn't here.

54:28.875 --> 54:34.291
Hello, boy. Have you seen a man
in a coach pulled by two horses?

54:36.625 --> 54:38.666
He was probably a lone traveler.

54:56.416 --> 54:59.375
The horses are still warm.
They can't have gone far.

55:05.458 --> 55:09.250
Who came on these horses?
Where are they?

55:11.833 --> 55:13.916
- Who are you?
- What?

55:14.541 --> 55:17.333
- Papers.
- Papers? Of course.

55:42.708 --> 55:45.916
-Remember, this is enemy territory.
-Don't point that at me.

55:49.250 --> 55:50.291
So...

55:51.666 --> 55:53.708
Do you know
where the man was going?

56:02.666 --> 56:04.250
Today, at the hearing...

56:05.458 --> 56:09.041
If we get him to admit that he's lying
and that the Germans sent him...

56:09.541 --> 56:11.791
-Why would he do that?
-We'll spare his life.

56:11.875 --> 56:15.166
-Offer him royal protection.
-The man is a traitor.

56:15.833 --> 56:19.625
He will be punished.
But we'll let him live.

56:19.708 --> 56:23.708
I know you want to save his life.
But we cannot show weakness now.

56:24.333 --> 56:27.416
-It's a fair sentence.
-Do you believe he is your son?

56:31.208 --> 56:32.916
Is that why you don't want to kill him?

56:33.416 --> 56:37.208
If he admits to everyone
that he is a swindler

56:38.583 --> 56:43.125
there will be no doubt who is the King.
Or who should sit on that throne.

56:43.791 --> 56:45.041
It will be yours.

56:46.166 --> 56:49.125
And we can close the case peacefully.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.333
Even Norway will have to back down
if he confesses.

56:54.083 --> 56:55.416
And what about you?

56:59.500 --> 57:00.791
Will you find peace, too?

57:02.000 --> 57:02.958
Yes.

57:05.958 --> 57:07.375
I will find peace, too.

57:08.333 --> 57:11.083
And we can continue
our negotiations with Bourcier.

57:16.250 --> 57:17.791
I'll go make him the offer.

57:19.041 --> 57:20.250
I'm coming with you.

57:21.458 --> 57:23.541
Only I can grant royal protection.

57:45.000 --> 57:46.166
Mother...

57:55.625 --> 57:57.083
Do you remember me?

58:01.208 --> 58:02.708
I cannot save you.

58:04.125 --> 58:05.291
But you can save yourself.

58:06.625 --> 58:09.791
Today, at the hearing,
you must admit that you are not King Oluf.

58:11.833 --> 58:15.291
Say that the Teutonic Order forced
you to make your false claims.

58:16.041 --> 58:17.083
And that you repent.

58:18.708 --> 58:21.041
You will be sentenced.

58:21.750 --> 58:23.375
You will receive punishment.

58:25.125 --> 58:26.333
But you'll be alive.

58:28.291 --> 58:30.583
Once things settle,
we can lessen the sentence.

58:30.666 --> 58:33.458
-I'd rather you kill me.
-This is your only chance.

58:35.625 --> 58:38.875
I've been imprisoned for 15 years.
I know who I am.

58:39.583 --> 58:40.666
And I want justice.

58:45.125 --> 58:46.541
You cannot be my son.

58:49.041 --> 58:50.041
Do you understand?

58:52.583 --> 58:53.833
You can't come here...

58:55.416 --> 58:56.666
15 years later...

58:58.291 --> 59:00.875
claiming to be my son.

59:03.583 --> 59:04.958
My son is dead!

59:06.708 --> 59:07.833
Mother...

59:14.083 --> 59:17.708
I am King Oluf Håkonsen!

59:19.208 --> 59:21.166
Crowned King of Norway and Denmark!

59:21.250 --> 59:23.125
And rightful heir to Sweden!

59:23.708 --> 59:25.625
I will not be caged like an animal

59:25.708 --> 59:30.166
by a little boy from Pomerania
sitting on my throne! You hear me?

59:30.916 --> 59:32.958
I will have justice!

59:33.041 --> 59:36.125
And all those who have defied me
will burn in hell!

59:36.208 --> 59:39.791
You hear me, you rat?
You will burn in hell!

1:00:20.458 --> 1:00:22.916
<i>I seek your countenance.</i>

1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:27.333
<i>Lord, your countenance I seek.</i>

1:00:28.708 --> 1:00:33.125
<i>Lord my God, teach my heart
where and how to seek you.</i>

1:00:34.083 --> 1:00:36.000
<i>Where and how to find you.</i>

1:00:36.916 --> 1:00:41.125
<i>Lord, if you are not present here,
where shall I look for you</i>

1:00:41.708 --> 1:00:42.708
<i>when you are not near?</i>

1:00:44.125 --> 1:00:46.000
<i>If you are everywhere...</i>

1:00:47.208 --> 1:00:49.333
<i>why then do I not see you?</i>

1:00:58.083 --> 1:00:59.291
What is it?

1:01:00.041 --> 1:01:01.208
It's Erik.

1:01:02.625 --> 1:01:03.958
I'm worried about him.

1:01:05.875 --> 1:01:10.458
I worry what he might do
if we don't soon put an end to this.

1:01:10.541 --> 1:01:12.958
Erik is young, but he isn't stupid.

1:01:15.125 --> 1:01:16.458
He's impatient.

1:01:17.708 --> 1:01:18.583
He's hurt.

1:01:21.125 --> 1:01:23.083
He might take matters
into his own hands.

1:01:25.583 --> 1:01:26.583
Malin!

1:01:31.625 --> 1:01:32.708
Fetch Astrid.

1:01:52.500 --> 1:01:53.666
Tell me about Erik.

1:01:54.333 --> 1:01:56.250
What's going on in his chambers?

1:01:59.416 --> 1:02:00.500
I don't know.

1:02:02.166 --> 1:02:03.291
Has he spoken to anyone?

1:02:13.791 --> 1:02:15.083
It's all right, Astrid.

1:02:16.541 --> 1:02:19.166
You're helping
your Queen who saved your life.

1:02:23.041 --> 1:02:26.666
-He spoke to Due.
-About what?

1:02:27.458 --> 1:02:28.750
I didn't hear everything.

1:02:31.458 --> 1:02:34.833
It's very important that you tell me
exactly what you heard.

1:02:36.708 --> 1:02:39.416
Something about some negotiations.

1:02:41.291 --> 1:02:43.791
Erik said he knew what Bourcier wanted.

1:02:45.916 --> 1:02:47.166
That's all I know.

1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:50.166
That's fine, Astrid.

1:02:52.875 --> 1:02:55.125
Find him and tell him
I want to speak to him.

1:02:58.416 --> 1:03:00.500
I won't mention you,
I just want to speak to him.

1:03:03.541 --> 1:03:04.708
I'm afraid he isn't here.

1:03:08.958 --> 1:03:10.000
Where is he?

1:03:14.541 --> 1:03:16.416
Fascinating this winged predator.

1:03:17.875 --> 1:03:19.375
I have a proposition, Sir Bourcier.

1:03:20.958 --> 1:03:23.291
Since my dear mother
is so busy at the moment

1:03:23.375 --> 1:03:25.458
why don't you and I
continue the negotiations?

1:03:28.625 --> 1:03:29.875
Shouldn't we rather wait?

1:03:31.708 --> 1:03:35.500
It's the King's wedding. It's only
natural that the King negotiates it.

1:03:38.875 --> 1:03:39.791
Of course.

1:03:40.583 --> 1:03:43.500
However, I was sent here
to negotiate with the Queen.

1:03:45.458 --> 1:03:47.833
My mother is not her usual self
these days.

1:03:48.583 --> 1:03:49.791
She's confused.

1:03:50.625 --> 1:03:52.708
It's my duty to protect her interests.

1:04:02.791 --> 1:04:05.625
I know that you discussed
the hereditary rights with my mother.

1:04:13.750 --> 1:04:16.208
I understand that you want
a fair position for Philippa

1:04:16.291 --> 1:04:17.833
and her family in the Nordic Dynasty.

1:04:22.166 --> 1:04:23.458
You're a very sensible man.

1:04:26.625 --> 1:04:27.750
Your Majesty...

1:04:30.541 --> 1:04:32.666
So...

1:04:35.166 --> 1:04:36.166
Let's begin.

1:04:41.166 --> 1:04:42.041
Very well.

1:04:43.583 --> 1:04:44.666
First the easy one.

1:04:45.833 --> 1:04:47.250
If Philippa delivers a boy...

1:04:47.541 --> 1:04:48.500
My King.

1:04:50.458 --> 1:04:51.875
Gentleman, hello.

1:04:56.041 --> 1:04:59.666
-Good idea with a bit of fun, Erik.
-I thought I'd entertain our guest.

1:05:00.375 --> 1:05:02.708
Let's not sit around and talk then,
let's hunt.

1:05:03.291 --> 1:05:05.083
Yes, let's.

1:05:07.166 --> 1:05:09.750
-Give me your seal.
-What?

1:05:09.833 --> 1:05:12.916
-Your seal. Give it to me.
-Mother...

1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:17.958
You have no right to meddle.
What you wish to give away isn't yours.

1:05:19.458 --> 1:05:21.333
You've borrowed it. At my mercy.

1:05:23.291 --> 1:05:24.416
Come now.

1:05:26.291 --> 1:05:30.791
Shall I ask the guards to search you?
No? Then give it to me, now.

1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:40.041
Thank you.

1:05:44.333 --> 1:05:45.375
Now let's hunt.

1:05:49.291 --> 1:05:52.500
She's the granddaughter of a falcon
my late father gave me.

1:05:52.958 --> 1:05:54.083
So beautiful.

1:06:08.125 --> 1:06:10.666
I hope you understand the negotiations
have taken a new turn.

1:06:10.750 --> 1:06:12.875
He has killed hundreds of geese.

1:06:15.958 --> 1:06:18.083
The King has just promised me
hereditary rights.

1:06:21.333 --> 1:06:22.666
That is not going to happen.

1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.125
Had I not happened to discover it

1:06:37.958 --> 1:06:41.000
you would have handed the entire
North to King Henry of England.

1:06:42.041 --> 1:06:45.041
The future of our children and
the generations to come.

1:06:47.625 --> 1:06:52.666
-The Queen's hesitation hurts us all.
-How could you go along with this?

1:06:52.750 --> 1:06:57.166
We need an agreement with England
because of the Teutonic Order.

1:06:57.250 --> 1:06:58.458
I know.

1:06:58.916 --> 1:07:03.708
But there haven't been any negotiations
since the false Oluf appeared.

1:07:03.791 --> 1:07:09.041
No. And you haven't made it any easier.
Now Bourcier has raised the price.

1:07:10.458 --> 1:07:13.583
To complete this deal,
we all have to contribute.

1:07:13.666 --> 1:07:15.125
This thing...

1:07:17.166 --> 1:07:18.666
is not about money.

1:07:20.833 --> 1:07:24.541
Bourcier will continue
to raise his demands.

1:07:27.041 --> 1:07:29.791
And King Henry?
When he hears what's happening...

1:07:29.875 --> 1:07:31.291
England needs us, too.

1:07:31.375 --> 1:07:35.875
Do you think they want a crumbling Union?
We don't even know who is King.

1:07:42.416 --> 1:07:43.500
Your Majesty...

1:07:47.083 --> 1:07:50.666
Everyone is talking.
Everyone is watching.

1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:56.166
Who is King of the Union
in the eyes of Europe right now?

1:08:20.583 --> 1:08:22.166
I apologize for the delay.

1:08:31.291 --> 1:08:32.750
I will hang the man.

1:09:30.916 --> 1:09:35.208
The accused is incoherent and
is not recognized by the woman,

1:09:35.291 --> 1:09:38.000
Her Majesty,
whom he claims is his mother.

1:09:38.083 --> 1:09:40.833
Please, I recognize my own King.

1:09:40.916 --> 1:09:44.416
- True.
- Guttorm recognizes him, too.

1:09:44.500 --> 1:09:47.458
Calm down, Asle.
We've heard enough.

1:09:49.041 --> 1:09:50.291
Stop!

1:10:04.333 --> 1:10:08.708
We've reached a conclusion.
And I will now...

1:12:46.250 --> 1:12:48.708
The rumors claimed
I killed my own child.

1:12:50.583 --> 1:12:52.041
I could never have done that.

1:12:54.250 --> 1:12:57.250
No. You couldn't.

1:13:00.666 --> 1:13:01.916
But you could.

1:13:10.125 --> 1:13:12.041
You charged Esge Vind with the task.

1:13:13.833 --> 1:13:15.166
But you didn't succeed.

1:13:22.041 --> 1:13:25.708
I gave you what you needed.
Didn't I?

1:13:28.041 --> 1:13:30.416
You would never have
achieved peace with Oluf.

1:13:31.875 --> 1:13:36.041
Sweden would not have accepted him.
He would have divided the North.

1:13:37.791 --> 1:13:39.541
You know it's true, Margrete.

1:13:41.250 --> 1:13:43.416
The North would have
become a battlefield.

1:13:50.750 --> 1:13:52.000
I need to be alone with him.

1:13:54.500 --> 1:13:56.500
-You can't.
-I must be alone with him.

1:13:58.750 --> 1:14:01.708
- I can't smuggle you in to him.
- Then smuggle him out.

1:14:02.500 --> 1:14:05.791
-To the church, to confess tonight.
-Margrete, please...

1:14:05.875 --> 1:14:08.250
How dare you ask me anything!

1:14:10.750 --> 1:14:12.333
After all that you've done.

1:14:15.958 --> 1:14:17.250
I did it for you.

1:14:19.333 --> 1:14:22.083
Think of all the sons we've spared
on the battlefield.

1:14:23.875 --> 1:14:25.541
Think of all those families.

1:14:28.125 --> 1:14:32.000
Maybe you did it because you were
afraid of losing what you've attained.

1:14:34.958 --> 1:14:36.208
All that wealth.

1:14:38.250 --> 1:14:39.416
All that power.

1:14:41.416 --> 1:14:42.375
That's not true.

1:14:45.458 --> 1:14:48.375
Who would have thought you would
become such a powerful man?

1:14:50.666 --> 1:14:53.166
You were an insignificant catechist.

1:14:54.541 --> 1:14:58.541
I took you in.
And I promoted you.

1:15:00.291 --> 1:15:01.791
I regret that now.

1:15:09.250 --> 1:15:10.625
But it's too late.

1:15:12.750 --> 1:15:13.750
Isn't it?

1:15:18.958 --> 1:15:20.708
Bring him to the church tonight.

1:16:17.458 --> 1:16:19.750
Hello, Raberlin.
What brings you to Malbork?

1:16:20.125 --> 1:16:22.041
- Business.
- What business?

1:16:23.708 --> 1:16:27.166
I buy and sell wares. It isn't
illegal to trade with the Germans.

1:16:27.250 --> 1:16:28.916
And what were you doing in Kalmar?

1:16:39.583 --> 1:16:42.000
Stop! Stop!
I'll talk...

1:16:42.750 --> 1:16:44.625
What do you know
about the man who came?

1:16:45.708 --> 1:16:48.125
King Oluf suddenly appeared.

1:16:48.208 --> 1:16:49.375
Where did he appear?

1:16:52.083 --> 1:16:56.041
No, don't.
He was kept hidden in a monastery.

1:16:56.625 --> 1:16:58.500
-A monastery? Where?
-In Rügen.

1:16:59.250 --> 1:17:00.416
Jacob?

1:17:05.625 --> 1:17:09.750
-A letter to the German Grand Master.
-Raberlin is a messenger.

1:17:11.875 --> 1:17:14.833
"Oluf Håkonsen's arrival has gone
according to plan.

1:17:15.958 --> 1:17:19.625
The Queen is shaken.
Negotiations with England have stalled.

1:17:20.750 --> 1:17:23.916
I am winning King Erik's trust.

1:17:24.500 --> 1:17:26.416
He's young and easily controlled.

1:17:27.041 --> 1:17:28.666
You can prepare the troops.

1:17:29.708 --> 1:17:32.041
Yours faithfully, Johan Sparre."

1:17:33.750 --> 1:17:39.833
The Germans will conquer the North.
That woman is taking over everything.

1:17:40.458 --> 1:17:43.666
May she go to hell.
Everyone curses her.

1:17:44.125 --> 1:17:46.291
-Who are you speaking for?
-All Germans.

1:17:47.500 --> 1:17:49.708
And all sensible men in the North.

1:17:52.375 --> 1:17:54.000
She's a witch.

1:18:07.250 --> 1:18:10.041
I'll sentence him myself right now.

1:18:10.125 --> 1:18:12.500
It's the only thing to do, Your Majesty.

1:18:12.583 --> 1:18:17.750
I agree, but we need the church,
the nobility and the people with us.

1:18:17.833 --> 1:18:20.750
- And Asle and Norway.
- We can't wait any longer.

1:18:21.291 --> 1:18:23.791
You mustn't appear as a rejected tyrant.

1:18:23.875 --> 1:18:26.666
People need to
see you as the righteous King.

1:18:27.125 --> 1:18:29.750
The Queen's natural heir.

1:18:31.625 --> 1:18:33.458
How will you get Norway to agree?

1:18:37.416 --> 1:18:42.416
If the King permits...
Allow me to think about it.

1:18:42.500 --> 1:18:46.375
You have until tomorrow.
Otherwise, I'll sentence him, regardless.

1:18:49.583 --> 1:18:50.541
Yes.

1:18:57.416 --> 1:18:59.000
It will work out.

1:19:33.083 --> 1:19:34.125
For you.

1:19:35.708 --> 1:19:36.666
For me?

1:20:27.333 --> 1:20:33.750
<i>Pray for us sinners.
Now and in our hour of death. Amen.</i>

1:21:38.375 --> 1:21:39.708
You forgot me.

1:21:43.708 --> 1:21:44.875
I tried.

1:21:53.583 --> 1:21:55.250
What did they do to you?

1:22:10.916 --> 1:22:14.916
I waited for you.
Every night, I waited for you.

1:22:16.625 --> 1:22:20.708
Every time someone passed my window,
I hoped it was you.

1:22:22.500 --> 1:22:23.916
But I didn't know...

1:22:30.708 --> 1:22:34.833
- I didn't know.
- I don't know who I am anymore.

1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:40.541
I don't know who I am.

1:23:09.416 --> 1:23:10.833
Let me look at you.

1:23:20.208 --> 1:23:22.291
Tell me about the man who freed you.

1:23:27.541 --> 1:23:32.083
Do you think it was the same man
who tried to kill me?

1:23:34.208 --> 1:23:35.458
No, it wasn't him.

1:23:38.500 --> 1:23:40.375
Would you recognize him
if you saw him?

1:23:42.666 --> 1:23:46.916
Think carefully.
Everyone who is close to us is here.

1:23:51.541 --> 1:23:53.333
They were in the Throne Room.

1:23:55.541 --> 1:23:57.041
No, I haven't seen him.

1:23:57.541 --> 1:23:59.333
Tomorrow at the hearing...

1:24:02.041 --> 1:24:05.625
take a good look at everyone.
See if you can spot him.

1:24:17.458 --> 1:24:20.166
Are you aware of the consequences
of your actions?

1:24:22.125 --> 1:24:24.541
-Yes.
-What about Erik?

1:24:25.625 --> 1:24:31.250
Your position requires you to stand
behind me, no matter what I decide.

1:24:44.958 --> 1:24:48.416
Astrid, calm down.

1:24:48.500 --> 1:24:52.208
Astrid, Astrid. Look at me.
Don't be afraid.

1:24:55.041 --> 1:24:56.791
Stay here.
Yes?

1:25:01.125 --> 1:25:04.708
Terrible news, my King. Malin?

1:25:05.708 --> 1:25:09.208
The Queen has announced
that the German is her real son.

1:25:11.166 --> 1:25:12.083
What?

1:25:14.500 --> 1:25:16.791
We have a new witness in the case.

1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:23.916
-What witness?
-One who will hopefully close the case.

1:25:26.958 --> 1:25:27.958
Fine.

1:25:31.583 --> 1:25:35.125
-We just need to discuss that girl.
-Astrid?

1:25:35.208 --> 1:25:39.875
Your mother is using her to spy on you
in a plot to dethrone you.

1:25:53.875 --> 1:25:55.041
Is it true?

1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:03.416
Did my mother ask you to spy on me?

1:26:08.208 --> 1:26:09.666
Answer me!

1:26:12.083 --> 1:26:13.208
Malin.

1:26:17.500 --> 1:26:18.708
Get up, whore.

1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:38.333
I was there when the Queen asked
Astrid to spy on you, Your Grace.

1:27:42.916 --> 1:27:44.125
Have you seen Sparre?

1:27:47.041 --> 1:27:49.041
Have you seen him
at any of the hearings?

1:27:53.291 --> 1:27:54.958
He hasn't been here.

1:28:02.416 --> 1:28:03.375
Welcome.

1:28:07.375 --> 1:28:09.541
Her Majesty the Queen will
open the hearing.

1:28:16.750 --> 1:28:20.291
I shall ask questions only
the real Oluf can answer.

1:28:20.708 --> 1:28:22.791
First I would like to summon a witness.

1:28:24.250 --> 1:28:26.958
I'm certain it will
shed new light on the case.

1:28:36.750 --> 1:28:38.083
Hildur?

1:28:50.708 --> 1:28:51.666
What is your name?

1:28:53.958 --> 1:28:55.416
Hildur Eiriksdóttir.

1:28:56.958 --> 1:28:58.833
What is your connection
to the accused?

1:28:59.541 --> 1:29:03.250
I was the wet nurse for
Her Majesty's son Oluf.

1:29:05.750 --> 1:29:07.166
Can Her Majesty confirm that?

1:29:10.583 --> 1:29:12.375
Can the Queen confirm that?

1:29:14.250 --> 1:29:17.041
Yes. I can confirm that.

1:29:21.916 --> 1:29:23.583
The man sitting there...

1:29:27.083 --> 1:29:28.333
Is that King Oluf?

1:29:39.208 --> 1:29:40.208
No, it isn't him.

1:29:48.208 --> 1:29:49.375
How do you know that?

1:29:54.625 --> 1:29:56.666
Because I taught him all he knows.

1:29:58.125 --> 1:30:00.833
I taught him to play the role
of the dead King.

1:30:02.875 --> 1:30:04.458
I taught him the lullaby.

1:30:06.666 --> 1:30:09.541
How could you lie about that?
Hildur?

1:30:13.791 --> 1:30:15.333
Does the witness have more to add?

1:30:17.708 --> 1:30:19.375
How did they make you do this, Hildur?

1:30:21.708 --> 1:30:26.083
-God will punish you, Hildur!
-We will now pass sentence. Peder?

1:30:27.833 --> 1:30:28.750
Hildur is lying.

1:30:30.791 --> 1:30:34.583
She could not speak freely.
Anyone can see that.

1:30:34.875 --> 1:30:39.250
Anyone can see that this has gone
too far. Please, continue.

1:30:40.250 --> 1:30:43.375
-I wish to summon a witness.
-Who?

1:30:45.458 --> 1:30:46.750
Johan Sparre.

1:30:48.166 --> 1:30:49.458
Johan Sparre?

1:30:52.916 --> 1:30:57.750
Has anyone seen Sparre at
a single one of Oluf's hearings?

1:31:01.041 --> 1:31:04.291
No, Your Majesty,
but he has...

1:31:05.166 --> 1:31:07.750
Oluf saw the man who freed him.

1:31:10.916 --> 1:31:17.083
-So why hasn't Sparre been here?
-You're proving just how mad you are.

1:31:17.166 --> 1:31:20.916
Summon him.
Let's hear what he has to say.

1:31:22.833 --> 1:31:25.958
You expect me to believe a swindler
over the Swedish Councilor?

1:31:30.375 --> 1:31:33.666
Sparre was much more powerful
under the German King.

1:31:36.083 --> 1:31:37.458
He has never been on our side.

1:31:39.083 --> 1:31:40.958
He wants to destroy the Union
from within.

1:31:42.500 --> 1:31:44.458
You are destroying the Union.

1:31:46.500 --> 1:31:50.291
You're so blinded by your own grief
that you can't see clearly.

1:31:53.000 --> 1:31:55.125
Had I dragged a donkey in here

1:31:57.166 --> 1:31:59.166
you would have believed it
to be your son.

1:32:02.333 --> 1:32:03.916
Let us pass sentence.

1:32:10.583 --> 1:32:11.541
I swear...

1:32:15.625 --> 1:32:20.666
I swear upon my father,
King Valdemar Atterdag...

1:32:22.833 --> 1:32:24.958
that this is my son.

1:32:28.916 --> 1:32:32.750
You yourself said he wasn't your son.
Everyone here heard it.

1:32:34.250 --> 1:32:36.291
How do you expect us
to take you seriously?

1:32:37.583 --> 1:32:40.083
With God as my witness, I sentence...

1:32:40.166 --> 1:32:43.000
God and the Church know the truth.

1:32:47.250 --> 1:32:49.833
I am standing beside
the true King of the Union.

1:32:53.041 --> 1:32:54.083
Peder?

1:32:55.541 --> 1:32:59.250
- We only have one King.
- One king. Oluf.

1:32:59.333 --> 1:33:02.000
He's standing there,
beside our Queen.

1:33:24.375 --> 1:33:27.000
The rightful King of the North
is called Erik.

1:33:29.041 --> 1:33:31.833
That is the position
of both Denmark and Sweden.

1:33:45.333 --> 1:33:46.333
Peder?

1:33:48.958 --> 1:33:50.083
What does the Church say?

1:34:17.333 --> 1:34:20.000
The Church chooses
what is best for the Union.

1:34:28.083 --> 1:34:32.541
I sentence the swindler to death.
He will be hanged at dawn.

1:34:34.375 --> 1:34:38.125
And arrest his supporters
for contempt of the Crown.

1:34:50.666 --> 1:34:53.958
Let the Queen be placed
under close guard.

1:34:56.250 --> 1:34:57.875
My beloved mother...

1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:02.083
will step down.

1:35:04.791 --> 1:35:09.083
Leaving the power
to her only son, King Erik.

1:35:10.875 --> 1:35:12.708
You don't know what you're doing.

1:35:47.875 --> 1:35:52.333
If you don't trust me, I don't see
my role here, or Sweden's.

1:35:52.416 --> 1:35:55.958
She called me a traitor.

1:35:56.041 --> 1:35:58.208
After all that I've done for the Union.

1:35:58.291 --> 1:36:00.916
-She doesn't know what she's saying.
-Perhaps.

1:36:03.833 --> 1:36:07.250
But everyone heard her accusation,
and people listen to her.

1:36:07.333 --> 1:36:10.750
She'll say no more.
I'll make a public apology.

1:36:10.833 --> 1:36:14.000
Words are no use.
It will take a strong signal.

1:36:18.166 --> 1:36:19.541
Go on.

1:36:22.666 --> 1:36:26.583
-I'll make you Minister of War.
-Your mother abolished the position.

1:36:27.208 --> 1:36:29.000
Maybe so, but now I'm in charge.

1:36:29.791 --> 1:36:31.291
It's not that simple, Erik.

1:36:32.916 --> 1:36:36.000
There's a reason why
your mother removed the title.

1:36:41.041 --> 1:36:43.083
You know how much you mean to me.

1:36:43.583 --> 1:36:46.333
But I need people who will
support what I do.

1:36:48.125 --> 1:36:49.333
In the name of God.

1:36:57.291 --> 1:36:59.708
You are a great man, Your Majesty.

1:37:01.791 --> 1:37:02.916
A great man.

1:37:10.666 --> 1:37:11.833
Yes...

1:37:45.708 --> 1:37:47.291
I'll be damned.

1:37:48.583 --> 1:37:51.708
-A whole army.
-And mercenaries too.

1:38:28.541 --> 1:38:29.750
Oluf?

1:38:33.583 --> 1:38:34.750
Oluf?

1:38:38.708 --> 1:38:41.833
-Someone will come and fetch you tonight.
-Where am I going?

1:38:42.125 --> 1:38:45.833
To Bergen. Asle and the Norwegian Council
will accompany us.

1:38:46.458 --> 1:38:50.166
-Will you come?
-Yes. There's nothing more to do here.

1:38:54.916 --> 1:38:59.250
- What will we do in Norway?
- You're not going to die here.

1:39:00.250 --> 1:39:03.916
We're together.
We'll figure out the rest.

1:39:06.041 --> 1:39:07.541
We'll figure out the rest...

1:39:12.833 --> 1:39:14.000
My son...

1:40:23.666 --> 1:40:24.708
Asle.

1:40:41.958 --> 1:40:45.708
<i>The cells are empty.
The prisoners have escaped!</i>

1:40:46.958 --> 1:40:49.208
It's time to go, Your Majesty.

1:40:51.250 --> 1:40:53.958
Look everywhere!
Check the north court.

1:41:11.708 --> 1:41:12.625
Asle...

1:41:23.833 --> 1:41:27.708
We're here to search the Queen's
chambers. King Erik's orders.

1:41:31.416 --> 1:41:33.541
-Your Majesty.
-Jacob.

1:41:37.250 --> 1:41:42.166
A letter from Johan Sparre to
the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order.

1:41:42.875 --> 1:41:44.291
We found it on Raberlin.

1:41:49.250 --> 1:41:54.000
"Oluf Håkonsen's arrival has
gone according to plan.

1:41:54.583 --> 1:41:59.208
I am winning King Erik's trust.
He's young and easily controlled.

1:42:02.208 --> 1:42:04.125
You can prepare the troops."

1:42:04.208 --> 1:42:05.500
There's more.

1:42:11.833 --> 1:42:12.791
But that's...

1:42:12.875 --> 1:42:16.333
A detailed description of
the entire Union's coastal defense.

1:42:19.875 --> 1:42:21.916
If this had
reached the Teutonic Order...

1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:25.500
They're putting together an army,
with French mercenaries.

1:42:25.583 --> 1:42:28.333
An invasion army. How many?

1:42:29.208 --> 1:42:30.708
At least 3,000.

1:42:32.583 --> 1:42:33.875
My Queen...

1:42:34.666 --> 1:42:36.250
-We must leave now.
-Yes.

1:43:04.041 --> 1:43:05.833
My Queen?
Your Majesty...

1:43:10.625 --> 1:43:12.291
I'll meet you behind the stables.

1:43:12.750 --> 1:43:14.791
-But, Your Majesty...
-Go.

1:43:15.750 --> 1:43:17.041
Jacob?

1:43:59.291 --> 1:44:00.291
Sparre.

1:44:12.750 --> 1:44:13.958
Forgive me.

1:44:19.416 --> 1:44:20.791
Erik.

1:44:23.250 --> 1:44:26.125
-They will crush him.
-Yes...

1:44:35.791 --> 1:44:37.000
I can't help him.

1:44:39.875 --> 1:44:41.125
Not without you.

1:44:42.750 --> 1:44:44.291
You have handed the power to Erik.

1:44:52.333 --> 1:44:53.500
Are you leaving?

1:44:58.333 --> 1:44:59.541
If so, I wouldn't be here.

1:45:02.708 --> 1:45:05.708
-What do you want?
-You must give him the letter.

1:45:11.375 --> 1:45:13.458
Even if he read that letter...

1:45:15.583 --> 1:45:17.166
he wouldn't listen to you.

1:45:19.500 --> 1:45:23.250
You humiliated him in front of everyone.
And you tried to depose him.

1:45:28.208 --> 1:45:29.916
No, he won't listen to me.

1:45:32.416 --> 1:45:34.375
Not as long as Oluf is alive.

1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:47.750
It's time to finish
what you started back then.

1:45:51.333 --> 1:45:54.875
-We need to get to the ship now.
-We're waiting for the Queen.

1:45:56.333 --> 1:46:01.166
-There are soldiers everywhere.
-Do as you like. I'm waiting for her.

1:46:02.208 --> 1:46:06.083
-She should have been here long ago.
-She's coming.

1:46:06.166 --> 1:46:09.208
Listen, we'll leave
when it gets light.

1:46:16.166 --> 1:46:17.000
There...

1:46:25.583 --> 1:46:26.708
There she is.

1:46:43.541 --> 1:46:44.875
Oh, God.

1:46:49.625 --> 1:46:50.791
Oh, God...

1:47:57.875 --> 1:47:59.291
Have you caught him?

1:48:01.625 --> 1:48:02.541
Mm.

1:48:02.625 --> 1:48:03.625
Alive?

1:48:18.916 --> 1:48:19.916
Yes...

1:48:21.916 --> 1:48:24.416
-I want to kill him myself.
-We'll spare his life.

1:48:26.041 --> 1:48:28.583
You can use him to control
the Swedish nobles.

1:48:29.416 --> 1:48:31.458
He's very cooperative, my King.

1:48:33.458 --> 1:48:35.791
I'll hang the false Oluf at sunrise.

1:48:37.625 --> 1:48:40.500
-He should be burned.
-I won't burn a traitor.

1:48:41.750 --> 1:48:46.000
Cleanse him of his sins and
grant him entry to God's kingdom.

1:48:46.083 --> 1:48:47.458
I won't make him a martyr.

1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:51.958
We'll burn the case records with him.

1:48:53.041 --> 1:48:54.500
All this will be forgotten.

1:48:55.333 --> 1:48:57.541
We'll pardon
Asle and the Norwegian Council.

1:48:57.625 --> 1:49:00.875
I don't take orders from you.
You betrayed me.

1:49:02.291 --> 1:49:06.208
You tore me away from everything I had.
Planted me here.

1:49:06.916 --> 1:49:10.666
Let me grow.
I was five years old.

1:49:14.458 --> 1:49:17.666
For what? Just to tear me up
by the roots again?

1:49:24.791 --> 1:49:27.458
When I brought you here,
you were a small, pale boy.

1:49:30.708 --> 1:49:34.458
Look at you now.
Now you're King.

1:49:50.708 --> 1:49:51.583
Erik?

1:49:57.541 --> 1:49:59.333
You need your mother's support.

1:50:13.291 --> 1:50:18.625
-And England?
-It will be a big, beautiful wedding.

1:51:07.625 --> 1:51:11.541
Skanør in Scania, Denmark,
28 September, 1402

1:52:14.875 --> 1:52:16.291
You weren't strong enough.

1:52:19.666 --> 1:52:21.250
I was much too strong.

1:53:29.416 --> 1:53:34.333
Get me down.
Get me down from here.

1:54:43.500 --> 1:54:48.000
The mystery of the false Oluf
has never been solved.

1:54:48.083 --> 1:54:51.083
No one knows who the man really was.

1:54:52.583 --> 1:54:57.000
The documents from the trial
were burned along with him,

1:54:57.083 --> 1:55:01.208
creating one of the most fascinating
mysteries in Nordic history.

1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:06.791
In 1406,
the wedding of King Erik and Philippa,

1:55:06.875 --> 1:55:10.875
the daughter of the English King Henry IV,
is held in Lund Cathedral.

1:55:10.958 --> 1:55:12.750
They do not produce any heirs.

1:55:13.291 --> 1:55:17.666
Despite internal dispute,
the Kalmar Union lasted for 126 years.

1:55:17.750 --> 1:55:20.875
Sweden left the Union in 1523

1:55:20.958 --> 1:55:25.708
while Denmark and Norway remained
twin kingdoms until 1814.

1:55:27.375 --> 1:55:32.041
The special bond that connects
the three countries to this day

1:55:32.125 --> 1:55:35.875
is to a great extent thanks
to one woman: Queen Margrete I.
