Hey.

1:32:10.960 --> 1:32:12.701
Hey.

1:32:14.920 --> 1:32:17.706
I gotta run.

1:32:19.098 --> 1:32:20.360
Christine?

1:32:20.447 --> 1:32:22.928
Yeah?

1:32:23.059 --> 1:32:26.845
Um. It is not gonna work.

1:32:38.465 --> 1:32:45.951
Last night. It. It was the
first time in a long time
that I felt good about myself.

1:32:52.392 --> 1:33:01.097
Being with a quadriplegic is not
going to make you a better
person.

1:33:01.184 --> 1:33:04.796
I am sorry.

1:33:04.883 --> 1:33:07.799
Me too.

1:34:32.275 --> 1:34:33.493
You are late.

1:34:33.580 --> 1:34:36.322
Sorry. It will not happen again.
