Previously on "The Secret Life
of the American Teenager"...

00:03.000 --> 00:05.300
I'm... pregnant?

00:05.300 --> 00:07.500
Amy, you can't be pregnant.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.600
Maybe we should think
about adoption.

00:09.600 --> 00:13.100
If I did end up having the baby,
do you think I could get married?

00:13.100 --> 00:14.000
Married?

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
Yeah.

00:15.100 --> 00:16.300
Ben said he would marry me.

00:16.300 --> 00:17.700
What's the matter with my girl?

00:17.800 --> 00:19.700
She's pregnant, George.

00:19.700 --> 00:23.000
I don't think it would be too smart
if Amy actually had your baby, do you?

00:23.000 --> 00:24.300
What? What baby?

00:24.300 --> 00:26.300
You mean she's having an abortion?

00:26.300 --> 00:28.900
This is not your problem.
This is my problem.

00:28.900 --> 00:31.500
If your decision is not to have the baby,

00:31.500 --> 00:33.600
you really should talk to your parents.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.200
Who's this Ritchie character, anyway?

00:35.200 --> 00:37.500
Ricky. He's in the band.
You've seen him.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.100
He's that drummer
that's always showing off.

00:39.100 --> 00:42.500
This girl I don't even know and care
nothing about is gonna ruin my life.

00:42.500 --> 00:45.000
You think Amy wanted this to happen?

00:45.000 --> 00:47.800
Grace, I regret what I did,
and I apologize.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.700
I take full responsibility for my actions.

00:49.700 --> 00:52.400
That's more than Ricky's
ever gonna do for Amy.

00:52.400 --> 00:55.000
Things are what they are, and we're
gonna have to figure them out.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.300
Do you think I made
the right decision?

00:57.500 --> 00:59.800
I think that you made
the right decision for you.

01:13.700 --> 01:16.600
I'm gonna drop your sister off
at school and hit the road.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.800
You're sure you're OK
talking to your dad alone?

01:19.800 --> 01:21.400
Yeah. I don't mind
talking to him alone.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.500
I just mind him
looking at me.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.800
You look fine. You don't
even look that different.

01:25.800 --> 01:29.700
No, Mom. Look at me. I'm huge,
and I'm gonna get more huge.

01:29.700 --> 01:31.000
It's OK, Amy. 

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Your dad loves you, and so
do I, and so does your sister.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.400
You don't have to go away.

01:38.400 --> 01:40.800
I don't mind asking your grandmother
if you can stay with her.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.100
I don't even mind telling her
why you want to stay with her,

01:43.100 --> 01:45.800
but you don't have to stay with her.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.900
You can stay here.

01:46.900 --> 01:49.300
Mom... let me go.

01:49.300 --> 01:51.500
You said I could go.
You promised me.

01:51.500 --> 01:55.500
I know, Amy, but I can't imagine
not seeing you every day,

01:55.500 --> 01:57.000
being with you through all this.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.800
I don't want you
to see me like this.

01:58.900 --> 02:00.200
I don't want anyone
to see me like this.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.800
I just....I wanna do this all alone.

02:02.800 --> 02:05.000
But you're not alone.

02:05.300 --> 02:06.600
We're alone.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Finally.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.000
Mom's been waiting for you.
You're gonna be late for school.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.500
Yeah, well, at least I'm not
gonna be late for my period.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.500
Ashley, apologize.

02:15.500 --> 02:18.000
Fine. I apologize.

02:18.600 --> 02:21.700
But you know she's pregnant. I don't
see why some good can't come of it.

02:21.800 --> 02:24.000
Why can't you make Dad come
home and have him help?

02:24.000 --> 02:26.900
I'm not even gonna be here, Ashley.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.000
I thought you two
were getting along.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.700
I thought you and Dad
were getting along.

02:32.700 --> 02:33.900
We're talking about Amy.

02:33.900 --> 02:36.000
That's all we ever do
is talk about Amy.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.700
Can't we talk about Dad for once?

02:37.700 --> 02:39.800
Your dad is the one
who decided to leave.

02:39.800 --> 02:42.500
Dad decided to leave.
Amy decided to leave.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.500
Maybe I'll decide to leave.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.100
Can I go live with him?

02:47.900 --> 02:49.800
May I go live with him?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.200
Let's go.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.500
So... that isn't a no.

04:00.600 --> 04:04.600
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.900
Why can't you mother
clean out the coffeemaker?

04:07.900 --> 04:11.200
No. Dad... I meant...

04:12.200 --> 04:15.900
No. Sweetie, don't do that, all right?
You been crying for weeks.

04:15.900 --> 04:16.899
Come on.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.200
It's OK.

04:19.200 --> 04:23.200
OK, it's not OK, but... I just
don't know how this happened.

04:23.400 --> 04:26.400
I mean how'd it happen, Amy?
How is this possible?

04:27.300 --> 04:29.100
Sex?

04:31.300 --> 04:34.800
I guess I should've talked to
you more about personal stuff.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.500
Guys.

04:36.900 --> 04:39.000
Where babies come from.

04:39.400 --> 04:43.100
But... you really think you wanna go
away and live with your grandmother?

04:43.100 --> 04:45.000
I mean, you think
that's the best thing?

04:45.600 --> 04:46.500
Yeah.

04:46.500 --> 04:49.200
Was that your idea
or your mom's idea?

04:49.300 --> 04:51.400
I don't wanna stay here, Dad.

04:52.100 --> 04:54.500
I don't wanna face everybody.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.000
What about Ben?

04:56.100 --> 04:58.600
I still wanna marry him, but...

04:58.600 --> 05:00.900
but Mom still thinks it's a bad idea.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.400
What do you think?

05:03.400 --> 05:05.500
Do you have any new
thoughts on that?

05:05.500 --> 05:08.000
Maybe later... when you're 30.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.200
Yeah.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.700
When the baby's my age - 15.

05:12.700 --> 05:15.200
Honey, everything's gonna be OK.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.600
These things happen.

05:17.600 --> 05:21.400
Mainly when guys talk young girls
into doing things they shouldn't.

05:21.400 --> 05:24.100
It's not all his fault.
I just let it happen.

05:24.100 --> 05:26.600
No, it's his fault.
He knew what he was doing.

05:26.700 --> 05:29.200
And this Ricky guy -
he knows about this?

05:29.500 --> 05:30.600
Yeah, he knows.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.200
But you haven't talked
to him face to face.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.200
No.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.300
I don't want anything
to do with that guy.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.300
Little late for that.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.800
After yo u have the, um... 

05:41.800 --> 05:45.100
child, then what?

05:46.800 --> 05:49.000
I don't know.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.300
I can't think about that
right now, Daddy.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.100
You haven't called me that
in so long, baby.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.700
Aw, Amy...

06:01.000 --> 06:03.200
Oh.

06:03.300 --> 06:07.000
Maybe it really is time
for me to come home.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.400
So, what are you gonna do?

06:14.400 --> 06:15.800
I'm not gonna do anything.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.400
Have you talked to her?

06:17.400 --> 06:19.400
No, I haven't talked to her.

06:19.400 --> 06:20.500
Well, talk to her.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.900
I don't wanna talk to her.
I don't want anything to do with her.

06:22.900 --> 06:25.600
You've already had something
to do with her, son.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.200
You are not my dad.

06:27.200 --> 06:31.100
You're right, I'm not, but I've tried
to be a good father to you,

06:31.100 --> 06:33.600
and now you're gonna be a father, so...

06:33.600 --> 06:35.600
what kind of father
are you gonna be?

06:35.600 --> 06:37.600
It's time to have a conversation.

06:37.600 --> 06:41.600
Go talk to her, today, this
morning before you go to school.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.100
I'm already late,
and don't you think

06:44.100 --> 06:46.100
if she wanted to talk to me,
she'd come talk to me?

06:46.100 --> 06:47.900
She knows where to find me.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.100
We have band together.

06:49.100 --> 06:51.200
So is she gonna stay in school?

06:51.200 --> 06:52.700
How would I know?

06:52.700 --> 06:54.700
Wait, how could she stay in school?

06:54.700 --> 06:56.200
She does have that option.

06:56.200 --> 06:59.800
She's not gonna come to school
when she's having a baby.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.800
Can't you do something about that?

07:01.800 --> 07:03.800
What would you want me to do?

07:03.800 --> 07:05.300
Aren't you a social worker?

07:05.300 --> 07:06.100
Yes.

07:06.100 --> 07:09.800
And I encourage teenage mothers
to stay in school.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.500
Are you kidding me?

07:11.500 --> 07:15.200
No, I am not
kidding you, Ricky.

07:15.200 --> 07:18.700
I encourage you
to take responsibility

07:18.700 --> 07:21.100
for whatever happens
to this baby.

07:21.100 --> 07:25.200
Not exactly the responsible type
and neither is she, thus the baby.

07:31.900 --> 07:33.400
Any word yet?

07:33.400 --> 07:36.200
We're running out of time.
We gotta get you to school.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.500
I haven't heard anything yet.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.500
All I know she wants to leave town.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.300
It's not that far away
to grandmother house.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.700
We can drive up
on the weekends and see Ames.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.700
She doesn't want us to see her.

07:45.700 --> 07:48.000
Or at least she doesn't
want me to see her.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.700
Is that crazy, or what?

07:49.700 --> 07:51.300
She's scared, Ben.

07:51.300 --> 07:53.900
I mean she's scared and she's
angry and she's overwhelmed.

07:53.900 --> 07:59.100
Do her and yourself a favor and go
along with the plan, whatever it is.

07:59.100 --> 08:01.200
Of course, whatever it is is
probably gonna change 

08:01.200 --> 08:02.800
over and over and over again.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.700
It's just not easy, that's all.

08:04.700 --> 08:07.600
What in life is easy?
Not much, that's what.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.200
Certainly not
the sausage business.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.900
Come on,
we better get going.

08:13.000 --> 08:13.900
Dad...

08:14.000 --> 08:16.700
I know, you wanna stay home.

08:16.900 --> 08:19.600
I'm pretty sure your mother
would want you to go to school.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.700
I don't think she would.

08:20.700 --> 08:23.400
All right, stay home,
as long as it's for one day.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.200
You don't wanna stay home
and hang out with me?

08:25.200 --> 08:26.900
No. Can't do, I'd rather stay busy.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.600
And besides...

08:28.700 --> 08:30.800
I'm pretty sure you
don't have any intention 

08:30.800 --> 08:32.900
of hanging around
the house all day.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.299
Am I wrong?

08:34.400 --> 08:35.100
No.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.600
Call her, text her, do something.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.700
Let me know what happens.

09:02.500 --> 09:03.500
Hello.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.100
I love you.

09:05.100 --> 09:06.200
Me too.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.800
Is he still there?

09:07.800 --> 09:09.100
No, he's gone.

09:09.100 --> 09:10.200
Then what's the decision?

09:10.200 --> 09:11.400
Decision?

09:11.400 --> 09:12.200
Are you goin'?

09:12.200 --> 09:13.600
Yeah.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.900
I'm going to my grandmother's.

09:16.100 --> 09:18.000
I thought maybe your dad
would say no.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.400
I think that's kinda up to me
to decide, don't you?

09:21.400 --> 09:25.100
Ben, you can't decide for me.
I have to go. I can't stay.

09:25.100 --> 09:27.000
Stay with me, at my house.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.700
I mean just say you're going to
your grandmother's,

09:28.700 --> 09:30.200
and live with me and my dad.

09:30.200 --> 09:33.000
I can't do that. I don't
want you to see me, either.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.400
I have to see you.
I'll die if I don't see you.

09:35.400 --> 09:38.700
OK, please don't say that.
We both know you're not gonna die.

09:38.700 --> 09:41.600
It makes me feel like
you're threatening to kill yourself.

09:41.600 --> 09:47.300
OK, one - "I'll feel really bad if I don't
see you" doesn't express my true feelings,

09:47.300 --> 09:49.900
and two - I think you're aware
that when you lose a parent,

09:49.900 --> 09:51.600
it makes you value your own life,

09:51.600 --> 09:55.200
so I have no intention of offing myself.

09:55.300 --> 09:58.100
I totally just forgot about your mom.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.300
Say something, please?

10:00.300 --> 10:03.500
You really think going to your
grandmother's is the only solution?

10:03.500 --> 10:05.100
No, I don't think
there is any solution,

10:05.100 --> 10:07.800
but I do think
it'll make things easier.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.300
Ben, this isn't easy.

10:09.300 --> 10:12.300
What is?
Not much, that's what.

10:12.300 --> 10:13.100
What?

10:13.100 --> 10:14.000
Nothing.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.300
Why is it going to be easier for people
to see you after you've had the baby?

10:17.300 --> 10:19.200
Either way, they know.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.300
Just don't care if they know.
Don't care.

10:21.300 --> 10:25.100
You can decide that, you know,
to not care what people think.

10:25.100 --> 10:26.600
Who doesn't care
what people think?

10:26.600 --> 10:28.100
Me. I don't care.

10:28.100 --> 10:31.000
Come on, Amy. At least consider
going back to school.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.100
I'll be right there with you,
holding your hand.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.900
I already told you I can't.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.300
They're a bunch
of high school students.

10:37.300 --> 10:40.100
Ben, I'm going to my grandmother's.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.700
You can come over tonight
and say goodbye if you want.

10:43.700 --> 10:45.400
I'll probably leave
in the morning.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.400
No.

10:46.400 --> 10:50.300
Thanks for asking, but, no,
I don't wanna say goodbye,

10:50.300 --> 10:54.100
because I don't want you
to leave.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.600
Who is it?

11:08.600 --> 11:10.100
It's me.

11:13.700 --> 11:14.800
What are you doing here?

11:14.800 --> 11:16.200
Come on,
let's stay home today.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.100
I can't.

11:17.100 --> 11:18.000
Why?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.300
'Cause I don't want to.

11:19.500 --> 11:22.300
All right. Can I stay here?

11:22.500 --> 11:24.300
I'm not in the mood
to go to school today.

11:24.300 --> 11:25.400
You can't stay here.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.400
Is your mom home?

11:26.400 --> 11:27.500
You know she's not.

11:27.500 --> 11:30.200
Come on, Adrian. I can't
go to school today.

11:30.200 --> 11:30.600
I can't.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.500
Sedlack will kill you
if you don't make practice.

11:32.500 --> 11:35.100
I'm already missing practice,
and I don't care about band.

11:35.100 --> 11:37.000
Can I come in?

11:44.300 --> 11:46.000
I need you.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.700
Oh, come on.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.100
My life is falling apart.
I need you.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.900
Really. Just take a day off.

11:51.900 --> 11:54.300
Call in sick, stay in bed.

11:56.100 --> 11:57.900
Mnh-mnh. I have to turn in
my English Lit paper.

11:57.900 --> 11:58.900
Turn it in tomorrow.

11:58.900 --> 12:01.300
No. I worked really hard on it.

12:01.300 --> 12:02.500
I'm not gonna
get points taken off

12:02.500 --> 12:04.900
just 'cause I didn't
turn it in on time.

12:06.300 --> 12:10.300
OK, I'll come back at lunch,
after English Lit.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.900
You can stay,
but I have to go.

12:28.400 --> 12:30.000
What are you doing home?

12:30.800 --> 12:33.200
Come on, you didn't think
I was actually going to school.

12:33.200 --> 12:36.200
We're parent-free.

12:36.300 --> 12:38.500
So, how'd it go with Dad?

12:40.100 --> 12:43.700
I don't know. He cried,
and I cried...

12:43.700 --> 12:44.700
Yeah, and?

12:44.700 --> 12:47.200
And he wants to come home.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.700
Thank you. Finally.

12:48.700 --> 12:51.500
Just because he says that
does not mean she'll let him.

12:51.500 --> 12:55.300
And aren't you concerned you're gonna
get in trouble for ditching school?

12:56.800 --> 12:59.000
Yeah.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.700
Guess I kinda
lowered that bar.

13:00.700 --> 13:03.700
Thank you for that, too.

13:04.900 --> 13:08.400
Don't you think you're taking this
whole thing a little too seriously?

13:08.400 --> 13:11.100
It's not like you're dying.
You're just having a baby.

13:11.100 --> 13:14.600
Just? Just having a baby?

13:14.600 --> 13:15.800
Ashley, I'm 15.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.300
I don't wanna have a baby.

13:17.300 --> 13:18.900
I just wanna be normal
like everyone else.

13:18.900 --> 13:20.900
I wanna go to a normal school
and be in the band

13:20.900 --> 13:23.900
and go to high school dances
and fall in love and get married

13:23.900 --> 13:25.800
and then maybe have a baby.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.800
Then why did you have sex?

13:27.800 --> 13:28.500
I don't know.

13:28.500 --> 13:29.900
I didn't... think about it.

13:29.900 --> 13:32.600
I didn't have a good reason.
I just did it.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.600
Ashley, promise me that you won't
have sex until marriage.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.900
Please. Not one of your fake
promises to Mom and Dad.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.000
A real promise. 

13:40.000 --> 13:41.600
I don't want you to make
the same mistake I did.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.200
Are you kidding?

13:43.200 --> 13:45.300
I have condoms.
I'm not an idiot.

13:45.300 --> 13:46.800
You have condoms at 13?

13:46.800 --> 13:48.100
Where did you get condoms?

13:48.100 --> 13:49.200
The grocery store.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.400
You are not using condoms.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.900
Now there's some really bad advice.

13:53.900 --> 13:56.500
OK, you know what I mean, Ashley.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.400
You don't need condoms.
Just say no.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.300
That doesn't work, obviously.

14:00.300 --> 14:02.200
I didn't say no.
I didn't say anything.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.900
I just let this happen.

14:03.900 --> 14:06.600
I cannot believe
I let this happen to me.

14:06.900 --> 14:08.900
Ashley, just listen to me.

14:08.900 --> 14:10.700
You do not wanna have a baby.

14:10.700 --> 14:13.100
Not at 13. That's why
I have the condoms.

14:13.100 --> 14:14.900
When did you even
get condoms?

14:14.900 --> 14:17.600
I dunno. Right after
I found out you were pregnant.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.800
It's not like they're illegal.
Anyone can buy 'em.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.100
Why are you in such a bad mood
this morning?

14:23.100 --> 14:24.600
I thought it was
because Dad was coming over,

14:24.600 --> 14:26.100
but that's obviously not it.

14:26.100 --> 14:27.600
I'm not in a bad mood.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.200
Yeah, you're right.
You're in an angry mood.

14:31.300 --> 14:33.700
What, are you angry at that guy Ricky?

14:33.700 --> 14:35.900
No. I'm just angry
with myself.

14:35.900 --> 14:37.300
No, that's not it.

14:37.300 --> 14:39.900
What, is it Ben?

14:39.900 --> 14:41.900
God, how can you be angry
with a guy who loves you

14:41.900 --> 14:44.600
despite the fact that
you're pregnant by another guy?

14:44.600 --> 14:45.700
I just can, OK?

14:45.700 --> 14:49.200
Well, it's a step up
from feeling sorry for yourself.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.000
Change your mind?

14:57.500 --> 14:59.200
Who are you?

14:59.200 --> 15:00.300
A friend of Adrian's.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.600
I didn't break in
or anything, honest.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.600
Are you breaking in?

15:04.600 --> 15:08.400
I got a key. What's your name?
I recognize you.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.500
Ricky Underwood.

15:10.500 --> 15:14.000
Oh, yeah, I know you.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.100
And you are?

15:15.100 --> 15:17.200
I'm Amy's dad.

15:33.700 --> 15:37.100
Don't you hit me. If you hit me,
I'll hit ya back, I swear.

15:37.800 --> 15:39.600
Why would I hit you?

15:44.900 --> 15:48.000
Oh, no. I know.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.400
I know, all right.

15:52.600 --> 15:56.400
And I'd like to hit you,
but if I started hitting you,

15:56.400 --> 15:58.400
I don't think I could stop.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.400
'Cause I wanna kill you.

16:02.300 --> 16:05.700
But for one - I don't feel like going to
prison for killing the likes of you,

16:05.700 --> 16:07.300
not that I couldn't get away with it,

16:07.300 --> 16:09.200
because believe me,
people would understand.

16:09.200 --> 16:13.500
And two - I don't wanna lose
any business for killing the likes of you.

16:13.500 --> 16:16.900
Because you know I'm the one who would
end up paying for whatever happens here.

16:16.900 --> 16:20.300
Which brings me to three -
I wanna talk to you.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.400
So you listen up.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.900
I don't want you involved in
anything that my daughter decides.

16:24.900 --> 16:28.900
Is that clear? You have no part
in the decision-making process whatsoever.

16:29.700 --> 16:32.000
And whatever decision Amy
and her mother and I make,

16:32.000 --> 16:33.500
that's it. That's the decision.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.300
Not yours.
You have nothing to say.

16:35.300 --> 16:37.500
No, of course not.
It's her baby.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.500
Don't be an idiot.
It's your baby, too.

16:39.500 --> 16:42.200
But you're not gonna have
anything to do with it, ever.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.500
If she wants to put it up for adoption,
you're gonna sign when you have to sign.

16:45.500 --> 16:46.500
OK.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.500
And if she ends up
keeping it...

16:47.500 --> 16:49.400
and she doesn't
want you around,

16:49.400 --> 16:50.600
you're not around.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.600
But believe me, you're gonna pay for
that baby for the rest of his or her life.

16:54.800 --> 16:57.000
You, not me. You.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.900
And that money doesn't
entitle you to a thing.

16:58.900 --> 17:01.000
You give up all rights
to anything and everything

17:01.000 --> 17:03.600
when you take advantage
of an innocent 15-year-old girl.

17:03.600 --> 17:06.900
I understand,
and I'm OK with all that.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.599
Band camp.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.700
That's what people do nowadays
at band camp, they have sex?

17:12.700 --> 17:14.599
It just happened.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.000
Sex doesn't just happen.

17:16.000 --> 17:16.700
I'm a man.

17:16.700 --> 17:20.099
I know how hard it is
to get a woman to have sex.

17:25.700 --> 17:28.300
Why do you have a key
to Adrian's condo?

17:28.300 --> 17:31.300
It's not her condo,
it's her mother's condo.

17:31.300 --> 17:34.100
I'm... putting some new
furniture in for her mother.

17:34.100 --> 17:36.900
I came by to measure a room,
not that it's any of your business.

17:36.900 --> 17:39.000
No, but I notice you feel comfortable here.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.500
You opened a new jar of mayonnaise.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.200
Are you seeing Adrian's mother?
You're the boyfriend?

17:44.200 --> 17:47.000
Let's just stick
with the furniture story.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.200
What, you got a problem
telling a little white lie,

17:51.200 --> 17:53.600
but you don't mind ruining
my daughter's life?

17:53.600 --> 17:55.500
'Cause you ruined her life.
You realize that, don't you?

17:55.500 --> 17:57.600
You ruined her life,
her sister's life,

17:57.600 --> 18:00.200
her mother's life, and my life,

18:00.200 --> 18:01.900
not to mention the life
of an innocent child.

18:01.900 --> 18:03.800
I don't think I've ruined
anybody's life.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.700
Why aren't you at school?

18:06.600 --> 18:09.200
'Cause I don't feel like having
people stare at me all day.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.000
So, what, you gonna
drop out of school, then?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.400
No, I'm not dropping out.

18:12.400 --> 18:15.300
I can't just drop out of school.
I'd like to, but I can't.

18:15.300 --> 18:18.100
Why not? Why can't you drop
out or go to another school?

18:18.100 --> 18:19.500
Amy's gonna have to go
to another school.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.900
Why shouldn't you?
Oh, that's right.

18:21.900 --> 18:24.000
Because people can see
that she's having a baby,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.800
but you, you just get to walk around

18:26.800 --> 18:30.100
like the worthless
piece of trash that you are.

18:31.300 --> 18:34.100
You stay away from my daughter
and you keep your mouth shut

18:34.100 --> 18:35.300
about me and Adrian's mom.

18:35.300 --> 18:38.100
No one knows about that
but me, her and Adrian.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.300
And now you.

18:43.800 --> 18:46.700
I'm not a worthless
piece of trash!

18:48.100 --> 18:53.600
*The feelings all roll back
As I flip another page*

18:53.600 --> 19:00.400
*It's funny how back then I'd dream
of better days, but when it all...*

19:00.400 --> 19:01.700
Hi, Adrian.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.200
Did you say something?

19:06.300 --> 19:07.400
Hi.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.000
Hi what?

19:09.000 --> 19:11.700
I wanted to apologize for the way
I talked to you at that clinic.

19:11.700 --> 19:12.800
I was in a panic.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.000
You were on a mission.

19:14.000 --> 19:14.800
I was.

19:14.800 --> 19:18.100
I still believe what I believe, but maybe
I could've handled the whole thing better.

19:18.100 --> 19:20.300
We can have a difference
of opinion and be friends.

19:20.300 --> 19:24.300
That little skirmish at the clinic
and a difference of opinion...

19:24.300 --> 19:27.800
that's what you think is
keeping us from being friends?

19:27.800 --> 19:31.700
How about we're not friends because... 

19:32.100 --> 19:34.400
your boyfriend and I hooked up?

19:34.400 --> 19:35.900
I've forgiven him.

19:36.100 --> 19:36.700
What?

19:36.700 --> 19:40.300
I don't know if we'll date again,
but regardless of that, I've forgiven him.

19:40.300 --> 19:44.000
And... I forgive you.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.800
Who are you to forgive me?

19:45.800 --> 19:49.000
You're exactly right,
who am I to forgive you?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.700
Forgiveness belongs to God,

19:50.700 --> 19:54.000
so I'm forgetting what happened
between you and Jack.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.700
I have the power to do that,
to forget, to just... let it go.

19:57.700 --> 19:59.400
It still happened.

20:00.114 --> 20:01.275
What happened?

20:01.574 --> 20:04.770
I hooked up with Jack.

20:05.474 --> 20:07.868
You did? I forgot.

20:07.903 --> 20:09.932
You haven't forgotten.
You can't.

20:09.967 --> 20:13.079
I don't think you can forget
I think it would've been a good idea

20:13.079 --> 20:15.442
if Amy decided
not to have a baby.

20:15.477 --> 20:18.046
Maybe if we were friends,
we could talk about that sometime.

20:18.494 --> 20:20.039
Or even if we can't be friends,

20:20.040 --> 20:22.115
maybe we can at least speak
in the hallway

20:22.150 --> 20:24.282
without it being a big deal
like it is now.

20:24.317 --> 20:27.195
I don't see any reason why we have 
to have hard feelings between us.

20:27.314 --> 20:28.665
OK, what is it?

20:29.005 --> 20:30.884
You think that if you're 
friends with me,

20:30.919 --> 20:33.284
you could still hang out
with Ricky, is that it?

20:33.319 --> 20:36.459
I can hang out with Ricky,
anyway, if I want to.

20:36.494 --> 20:38.715
Your Christian parents are gonna
 let you hang out with a guy

20:38.750 --> 20:40.978
that got a 15-year-old girl
pregnant?

20:41.733 --> 20:42.836
I guess.

20:42.871 --> 20:45.321
A guy like that needs friends now,
don't you think?

20:45.356 --> 20:47.490
No, I don't think.

20:47.709 --> 20:50.699
The only friend he needs is me.

20:51.260 --> 20:52.595
OK.

20:54.632 --> 20:56.347
But don't you need a friend?

20:56.382 --> 20:59.633
You're the girlfriend of a guy
who got a 15-year-old girl pregnant.

20:59.668 --> 21:03.124
The whole situation is so sad, I think.

21:03.124 --> 21:06.605
Must be so tough on both of them,
having a baby so young.

21:06.605 --> 21:10.807
He's not having a baby.
She's having a baby.

21:10.842 --> 21:12.308
And I hear she's
 leaving town to do it,

21:12.308 --> 21:13.723
so she's not gonna
be around anymore.

21:13.723 --> 21:15.785
It's over for her and Ricky.

21:15.785 --> 21:18.496
You don't think at some point
Ricky's gonna wanna see his own baby

21:18.531 --> 21:21.201
or be involved with his child
as he or she grows up?

21:21.336 --> 21:22.064
Nope.

21:22.064 --> 21:24.908
I can't imagine Ricky would
never wanna see his own child.

21:24.943 --> 21:26.860
That's 'cause you live with
two parents.

21:26.895 --> 21:28.709
Most families
aren't like that.

21:28.744 --> 21:30.989
Every child has two parents.

21:31.024 --> 21:32.452
I don't.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.987
Bye.

21:39.022 --> 21:41.100
Call me sometime.
We'll talk.

21:41.383 --> 21:44.107
Or just drop by.
You don't have to call.

21:51.069 --> 21:52.153
I'm not nothin'.

21:52.154 --> 21:53.893
He has no right
to talk to me like that.

21:53.928 --> 21:55.930
I'm a human being.
I'm as good as he is.

21:56.331 --> 21:58.419
I could've punched
that guy.

21:58.419 --> 22:00.291
But you came here instead
to talk it out,

22:00.292 --> 22:01.843
so you didn't punch him.

22:01.878 --> 22:03.465
That doesn't mean I won't.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.015
-I think it does.
-No, it doesn't.

22:05.015 --> 22:08.045
The next time he or anyone else
tells me I'm trash, I'm gonna punch 'em.

22:08.080 --> 22:09.093
No, you're not.

22:09.094 --> 22:10.756
Didn't I just say I was?

22:10.791 --> 22:13.643
I'm not gonna let anyone
talk to me like that ever again.

22:13.678 --> 22:16.690
Because you're not trash.
You're a man. You're somebody.

22:16.725 --> 22:20.446
What are you sayin'? I'm pourin' my 
guts out, and you're mocking me?

22:20.882 --> 22:24.347
I'm not mocking you at all.
I'm agreeing.

22:24.347 --> 22:25.947
I don't know what
you're talking about.

22:25.982 --> 22:29.351
Half the time I'm here, I don't know what 
you're talking about or who you're talking to.

22:29.351 --> 22:32.481
That's because up until now,
you didn't know who you are.

22:32.516 --> 22:34.312
-Who am I?
-You're a man.

22:34.347 --> 22:37.219
As good as Amy's dad,
as good as anyone else.

22:37.254 --> 22:39.483
You're a human being.

22:39.518 --> 22:41.980
No matter how you've been
treated before in this life,

22:41.981 --> 22:45.203
you are a human being,

22:45.479 --> 22:47.465
and human beings make mistakes.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.281
How can I be a man
who's as good as everyone else

22:49.281 --> 22:51.385
when I made the mistake
of getting a girl pregnant?

22:51.420 --> 22:53.720
A 15-year-old girl is pregnant
because of me,

22:53.721 --> 22:55.788
and I don't care
about her or the baby.

22:55.788 --> 22:58.535
All I care about is that
her father called me trash,

22:58.536 --> 23:01.270
and I'm not trash.

23:01.305 --> 23:04.058
-Because?
-Because I'm not.

23:04.058 --> 23:07.825
That is as good an
 answer as any.

23:08.504 --> 23:11.466
You're the doorway
to self-respect.

23:11.637 --> 23:13.305
Open it, Ricky.

23:13.305 --> 23:15.911
Open it and go on in.

23:17.742 --> 23:19.114
I don't know how.

23:19.319 --> 23:20.884
I think you do.

23:27.965 --> 23:29.409
Hello.

23:31.637 --> 23:32.938
Anyone home?

23:38.804 --> 23:40.792
Came home from school for this?

23:49.183 --> 23:51.986
-Yeah, it's me. What do you want?
-Where are you?

23:51.986 --> 23:54.553
Leave a message, not that
I'll call you back.

23:55.860 --> 23:59.607
So I came home.
Where are you?

23:59.863 --> 24:01.100
Adrian?

24:02.078 --> 24:03.074
What are you doing here?

24:03.109 --> 24:05.266
-What are you doing here?
-I live here.

24:05.401 --> 24:06.892
Why aren't you
at the furniture store?

24:06.893 --> 24:07.988
I brought you something.

24:08.023 --> 24:10.542
-It's all set, boss.
-Thanks, fellas.

24:12.042 --> 24:13.537
-You brought me something?
-Yeah.

24:13.537 --> 24:15.308
Something for you
and your mom.

24:15.343 --> 24:18.011
-I don't want anything from you.
-Fine. I'll take it back.

24:18.011 --> 24:19.636
At least take a look
at it first.

24:32.421 --> 24:33.721
Why would you get me a desk?

24:33.722 --> 24:35.325
What am I gonna do with a desk?

24:35.360 --> 24:38.291
I see you studying at the kitchen
 counter, on the couch, all over the place.

24:38.326 --> 24:39.715
Thought you might like a desk.

24:39.929 --> 24:40.936
What do you want?

24:40.971 --> 24:43.397
-Nothin'.
-No, you want something.

24:43.397 --> 24:46.260
-You all want something.
-All?

24:46.703 --> 24:49.714
Oh, OK, I get it.

24:50.282 --> 24:51.790
You don't want me
to say anything to Amy.

24:51.825 --> 24:53.638
Of course I don't want you 
to say anything to Amy.

24:53.639 --> 24:54.685
I don't want you to say
anything to anyone.

24:54.685 --> 24:56.397
But this isn't a bribe,
it's a gift.

24:56.513 --> 24:57.388
So...

24:57.388 --> 24:58.990
did you get my mother
a new desk, too?

24:58.990 --> 25:00.341
No, an armoire.

25:00.441 --> 25:02.241
Oh...

25:06.607 --> 25:09.239
Top-of-the-line armoire.
It was made in India.

25:10.778 --> 25:11.868
Goodbye, George.

25:12.008 --> 25:13.127
Goodbye?

25:13.127 --> 25:14.776
You're breaking up with her,
aren't you?

25:14.777 --> 25:16.111
What are you talking about?

25:16.111 --> 25:18.917
All the last guy gave us
was a box of steaks.

25:20.029 --> 25:22.095
I knew you were smart.
That's why I got you the desk.

25:22.095 --> 25:23.747
Just leave.

25:24.161 --> 25:26.821
Just so you know,
Ricky was here earlier.

25:26.821 --> 25:28.596
I came by to get some things,
and he was here. 

25:28.821 --> 25:29.892
Be careful.OK?

25:29.892 --> 25:32.965
Or what? I'll end up pregnant?

25:34.258 --> 25:36.463
-Everyone knows.
-All right.

25:36.542 --> 25:37.699
Is that why you're 
going home?

25:37.700 --> 25:39.154
That's none of your business.

25:40.518 --> 25:42.682
Guys would like you anyway,
you know that, right?

25:42.682 --> 25:43.753
What do you mean, anyway?

25:43.772 --> 25:45.135
Even if you don't have sex
with 'em.

25:45.135 --> 25:47.394
And that's
none of your business.

25:48.014 --> 25:49.761
You're welcome for the desk.

26:09.309 --> 26:10.585
Hey, jerk.

26:10.585 --> 26:12.665
I'm sorry.
My day took a weird turn.

26:12.665 --> 26:14.328
Yeah, so did mine.

26:14.455 --> 26:15.719
You coming over or not?

26:15.719 --> 26:17.815
Nah. Something I have to do.

26:18.034 --> 26:20.366
Amy's father
said he talked to you.

26:20.366 --> 26:23.326
He's not trying to force you
to marry her, is he?

26:23.466 --> 26:25.693
No. Pretty much the opposite.

26:25.777 --> 26:29.896
Look, I can't ignore the fact
that I'm the father of a baby.

26:29.896 --> 26:31.713
Sure you can.
Lots of guys do.

26:31.713 --> 26:33.640
Lots of guys? Like who?

26:33.683 --> 26:35.227
Like my father.

26:36.097 --> 26:37.219
I didn't know.

26:37.219 --> 26:39.763
You do what you have to do.
I don't care.

26:39.763 --> 26:42.447
Yeah, ya do care, and I know
you were counting on me to come over,

26:42.447 --> 26:44.138
and I'm sorry.

26:44.958 --> 26:46.671
I'm gonna start being
more responsible.

26:46.671 --> 26:49.014
I just have to
take care of something.

26:49.014 --> 26:51.084
Look, I don't need you
to come over.

26:51.085 --> 26:52.637
 I have friends.

26:52.637 --> 26:54.399
No, you don't.

27:07.382 --> 27:08.552
Call her back?

27:09.455 --> 27:11.419
Yeah, called her back.

27:11.608 --> 27:12.347
Good.

27:12.347 --> 27:15.326
That's a start. What's next?

27:23.320 --> 27:24.283
Hi.

27:26.395 --> 27:29.430
Hi. I didn't know you guys
were stopping by

27:29.430 --> 27:31.789
during school hours,
uninvited.

27:31.789 --> 27:32.917
Your dad called.

27:32.917 --> 27:34.742
He thought maybe
you needed some company.

27:34.742 --> 27:37.063
No, that's fine.
Thank you, though.

27:37.063 --> 27:38.305
Did you hear from Amy?

27:38.305 --> 27:40.474
-Is she...
-Leaving?

27:41.807 --> 27:42.358
I guess so.

27:42.358 --> 27:44.429
Are you going over to her house
to say goodbye?

27:44.430 --> 27:45.365
No.

27:46.334 --> 27:47.172
No.

27:48.700 --> 27:49.351
I can't.

27:49.351 --> 27:51.275
You have to say goodbye.

27:52.604 --> 27:54.511
Doesn't matter.
She'll be back.

27:54.511 --> 27:56.340
Yeah, eventually.

27:56.747 --> 27:59.899
She doesn't want me to see her,
either, when she gets...

28:01.417 --> 28:02.653
bigger.

28:02.949 --> 28:04.832
Like that would matter to me.

28:05.204 --> 28:07.646
All right, you guys
make yourselves at home.

28:08.105 --> 28:09.181
Want some company?

28:09.181 --> 28:12.208
No. I got my dad's driver
for company, but thanks.

28:14.924 --> 28:16.063
Sweet.

28:16.063 --> 28:18.322
We can't just stay here
when Ben's not here.

28:18.323 --> 28:19.223
Yeah, we can.

28:19.224 --> 28:20.438
We're his best friends.

28:20.438 --> 28:24.499
Yeah, which is why he left us his
 room for the first time ever.

28:24.870 --> 28:26.656
Have we ever
been in here alone?

28:26.656 --> 28:27.950
Is this a set-up?

28:27.950 --> 28:29.840
-No, I swear.
-I'm not having sex.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.839
Is that why you wanted me
to come here, to have sex?

28:31.839 --> 28:34.168
It's pretty much why I do
everything - to have sex.

28:34.169 --> 28:35.347
But we don't have sex.

28:35.347 --> 28:38.082
But we could if we wanted.

28:38.082 --> 28:39.053
I have a condom.

28:39.053 --> 28:41.503
You think because we're in high school, 
we're supposed to have sex?

28:41.503 --> 28:44.873
I don't know about supposed to,
but I'd really like to,

28:44.873 --> 28:47.512
and you said you wanted to
take the next step, right,

28:47.512 --> 28:51.778
before, when you decided,
so now I decided.

28:51.778 --> 28:54.504
By next step, I didn't mean
actual intercourse.

28:54.504 --> 28:55.507
I meant next step.

28:55.507 --> 28:58.079
Yeah, and I think we took
that next step.

28:58.079 --> 28:59.319
Please, Alice.

28:59.319 --> 29:03.175
Maybe on your birthday,
if you don't beg. I hate begging.

29:03.175 --> 29:04.671
My 16th birthday?

29:04.671 --> 29:05.718
Oh, no. 

29:05.719 --> 29:08.390
I don't know why
I said that. No, probably not.

29:08.390 --> 29:10.325
-But maybe.
-No.

29:10.325 --> 29:12.061
-Come on, say maybe.
-No.

29:12.061 --> 29:14.370
-I already said I hate begging.
-OK, I hear ya.

29:15.113 --> 29:16.085
I can live with no.

29:16.085 --> 29:17.341
You'll have to.

29:20.271 --> 29:24.680
When we get older and we do get 
married and we do have sex,

29:24.859 --> 29:27.370
I bet it's going to be
really good sex.

29:28.164 --> 29:30.217
Most people
don't have good sex.

29:30.217 --> 29:34.511
52% of Americans 16 and older
are not fully satisfied with their sex lives.

29:34.511 --> 29:35.722
But we're not like most people.

29:35.723 --> 29:37.929
How can you look at me
and still wanna have sex?

29:37.929 --> 29:40.748
How can I look at you
and not wanna have sex?

29:45.012 --> 29:49.794
But I'm a man, and I can
take no for an answer.

29:54.032 --> 29:55.893
Good, because
you'll have to,

29:55.893 --> 29:59.219
at least for a few more birthdays
or until I decide otherwise.

30:12.545 --> 30:14.339
 Amy, it's me.

30:15.121 --> 30:16.410
-Oh, no.
-Who's me?

30:16.649 --> 30:18.313
It's Ricky.
Can I talk to you?

30:18.314 --> 30:19.345
No, no, no.

30:23.756 --> 30:26.636
Uh, is Amy home?
I'm her friend Ricky.

30:29.947 --> 30:31.384
Could we talk?

30:31.933 --> 30:33.032
I don't know.

30:33.387 --> 30:36.827
I talked to your dad earlier,
or he talked to me.

30:37.219 --> 30:38.431
My dad?

30:40.754 --> 30:43.709
Look, Ricky, I'm not sure
I really wanna talk to you now.

30:43.709 --> 30:46.381
I'm not sure I wanna talk
to you, but we have to talk.

30:46.381 --> 30:48.404
No, we don't have to talk.

30:48.404 --> 30:49.931
Are your parents home?

30:49.931 --> 30:50.899
Why?

30:50.899 --> 30:53.522
If they're not, I'll come back and talk to you
when one of them is here,

30:53.522 --> 30:55.633
either your mom, your dad,
or both.

30:55.646 --> 30:58.606
I think it's best if we have a chaperone,
parent-type chaperone,

30:58.606 --> 31:01.348
maybe not in the same room,
but in the house, anyway.

31:01.348 --> 31:03.160
What do you even
wanna talk about?

31:05.856 --> 31:07.090
She knows.

31:07.090 --> 31:09.991
I know everything,
and I have condoms.

31:12.233 --> 31:13.184
I'll come back.

31:13.184 --> 31:16.288
Considering our situation, I'd like to have
one of your parents here.

31:16.288 --> 31:18.714
I'd like to talk
before you leave town.

31:18.714 --> 31:21.324
Are you leaving?
That's the rumor around school.

31:21.324 --> 31:22.808
Maybe. 

31:23.556 --> 31:26.227
Did you say you actually
talked to my dad earlier?

31:26.227 --> 31:30.075
Yeah, and I made some promises to him
I don't think I can keep.

31:30.075 --> 31:31.049
Like?

31:31.049 --> 31:33.889
Like I think I do wanna
be involved.

31:33.889 --> 31:35.177
Seriously?

31:35.177 --> 31:36.217
Involved?

31:36.217 --> 31:37.792
I'm the father of this child,

31:37.792 --> 31:40.508
and I think I should have
some say in what happens here.

31:41.874 --> 31:45.742
Just call me when I can come over
and talk to you, OK?

31:53.854 --> 31:56.055
OK, now I see how it happened.

31:58.614 --> 32:00.646
She's beautiful,
don't you think?

32:05.326 --> 32:08.232
I know we're a little young,

32:08.232 --> 32:12.376
and... she's
a little pregnant...

32:13.871 --> 32:17.270
...but I'm really in love,

32:18.334 --> 32:20.549
and I don't think
she understands that.

32:21.590 --> 32:23.216
If she did, I don't think she'd 

32:23.604 --> 32:26.198
be running off
to her grandmother's house.

32:26.650 --> 32:30.709
This is the woman I wanna spend
the rest of my life with.

32:32.645 --> 32:35.316
She says she feels
the same way about me, but...

32:37.954 --> 32:39.169
I don't know.

32:40.005 --> 32:43.746
Of course, it's complicated,
but life is complicated.

32:44.079 --> 32:47.753
Heh. I sound like Dad,
don't I?

32:48.426 --> 32:51.745
Except Dad would add,
"Sausage is complicated."

32:52.464 --> 32:53.843
Probably. 

32:55.161 --> 32:56.977
That's not her,
you know.

32:57.495 --> 32:58.634
It's her.

32:59.166 --> 33:02.888
Nah, that's the container that holds
 the container that used to be her.

33:04.351 --> 33:08.082
Is this the first time you've come to see her
since we said goodbye to her?

33:08.222 --> 33:11.332
It is, yeah.
I don't like coming here.

33:11.365 --> 33:13.488
But I didn't come for her,
I came for you.

33:13.806 --> 33:17.279
Why do you come here every year
on the anniversary of her death?

33:17.293 --> 33:19.972
Why do you do this
to yourself every year?

33:19.972 --> 33:22.195
'Cause every day
would be too often.

33:22.195 --> 33:24.527
Life is for the living, son.

33:24.527 --> 33:27.121
You can talk to the deceased
but not the living?

33:27.121 --> 33:28.521
Join the living.

33:28.901 --> 33:31.112
If Amy's leaving
and going to her grandma's,

33:31.112 --> 33:32.481
then that's what's happening.

33:32.976 --> 33:35.226
Do you won't be together
for the rest of your lives.

33:35.226 --> 33:37.915
It means she's going away
for a while.

33:38.248 --> 33:40.215
For a while. Get it?

33:40.216 --> 33:42.341
She's not leaving forever.

33:42.341 --> 33:44.218
She's choosing to go.

33:45.273 --> 33:48.509
Mom, she didn't have a choice,
but Amy is...

33:48.509 --> 33:51.096
You can't have your way
on this one, Benjamin.

33:51.493 --> 33:54.104
Jue I couldn't
have my way on that one.

33:54.631 --> 33:56.087
Live with it.

34:25.569 --> 34:27.138
I'm really happy
you stopped by.

34:27.138 --> 34:29.068
And surprised.

34:29.068 --> 34:30.295
Yes, we're very happy.

34:30.295 --> 34:33.601
We're very happy.
We've heard so much about you.

34:33.601 --> 34:37.858
From me. That's why
we are surprised.

34:37.858 --> 34:38.980
Yeah.

34:39.233 --> 34:45.246
I remember the other time
I was surprised to see you.

34:45.246 --> 34:48.121
Why don't we just
let that go, Tom? Let it go.

34:48.757 --> 34:50.940
Really. We're really happy
you stopped by.

34:50.940 --> 34:52.322
I didn't have your number.

34:52.322 --> 34:55.503
I don't usually just
stop by anywhere.

34:55.503 --> 34:57.548
I don't even know why
I did this.

34:57.548 --> 34:59.915
Maybe it's because I asked
if you wanted to be friends.

35:00.102 --> 35:01.931
I'd really like to be friends.

35:01.932 --> 35:03.194
Really?

35:03.194 --> 35:05.678
Yeah, Grace is friends
with lots of people, Tom.

35:05.855 --> 35:07.755
Lots of people.
She's very friendly.

35:08.324 --> 35:10.863
Um, are you hungry?

35:10.864 --> 35:11.936
Have you had dinner?

35:11.936 --> 35:14.519
I'm not hungry. I don't
usually eat this early.

35:14.519 --> 35:16.767
We don't either, but my wife
had a function at church,

35:16.768 --> 35:17.847
lots of leftovers,

35:17.847 --> 35:20.765
so I can fix you a plate.
I'll get you something.

35:20.765 --> 35:22.549
No, I'm really
not hungry.

35:22.549 --> 35:24.559
Is it me?

35:24.559 --> 35:27.683
Sometimes
I make people nervous.

35:27.684 --> 35:29.059
Oh, no.I like you.

35:29.059 --> 35:30.487
You seem to be pretty honest.

35:30.487 --> 35:32.562
Yeah, I am.

35:32.562 --> 35:35.187
-Well, not that many people are honest.
-Yeah.

35:35.187 --> 35:37.157
-Yeah.
-True.

35:37.157 --> 35:42.236
I know. You thought Ricky
is here.

35:42.236 --> 35:43.860
Oh, no. I know where he is.

35:43.861 --> 35:46.282
Is he at Amy's?

35:46.282 --> 35:48.931
-And you would know that how?
-I was guessing.

35:48.931 --> 35:50.808
I told you at school
I thought maybe Ricky

35:50.808 --> 35:53.760
was capable of taking some
 responsibility for what happened.

35:54.234 --> 35:56.315
Not that I know him
better than you.

35:56.879 --> 35:58.798
I'm just an optimistic person.

35:58.798 --> 36:01.869
Just being optimistic,
hoping for the best.

36:01.869 --> 36:03.943
And in this situation,
what do you think is the best?

36:03.943 --> 36:07.299
Ahem. Why don't you let me
take this one, all right?

36:07.299 --> 36:12.411
Um, in this situation, I think the very
 best possible choice for Amy and Ricky

36:12.411 --> 36:15.869
would be to find a loving family
to adopt the baby.

36:15.869 --> 36:17.498
That way,
when the baby grows up,

36:17.498 --> 36:20.196
he or she can be thankful
to both of them

36:20.196 --> 36:23.130
for providing a loving family
that has two adults

36:23.130 --> 36:26.239
that can actually
take care of him or her.

36:26.239 --> 36:28.647
Yeah. That's good.

36:28.907 --> 36:31.599
Tell you what - Tom,
why don't we give the girls

36:31.599 --> 36:34.033
a little private time
to talk? What do you say?

36:36.555 --> 36:38.004
Good night.

36:39.309 --> 36:40.562
Really nice to meet you.

36:40.563 --> 36:41.570
You too.

36:51.539 --> 36:53.696
I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

36:53.696 --> 36:55.980
I don't wanna talk
about Ricky or the baby.

36:55.980 --> 36:58.383
I thought I did,
but I don't.

36:58.383 --> 37:02.289
I don't know, I didn't want him
to be my only option tonight.

37:03.395 --> 37:04.477
I should go.

37:04.478 --> 37:05.634
No, please, stay.

37:05.634 --> 37:07.737
When you drop by, you're
supposed to stay a while.

37:07.737 --> 37:08.912
There are rules?

37:08.912 --> 37:11.216
No, but hang out.
We'll talk about something else.

37:11.217 --> 37:12.432
Anything else.

37:12.432 --> 37:14.073
Like?

37:14.073 --> 37:17.440
Like... I don't know.

37:17.935 --> 37:20.748
I don't have any girlfriends
that I do this with, either,

37:20.749 --> 37:21.764
so...

37:21.764 --> 37:23.679
I'm not really any better
at this than you.

37:30.693 --> 37:32.419
So what's new in your life?

37:33.888 --> 37:35.319
Oh, I got a new desk.

37:35.659 --> 37:37.486
A desk? That's great.

37:37.487 --> 37:39.109
 I'd love
to come see it sometime.

37:39.109 --> 37:40.405
OK.

37:40.901 --> 37:42.679
Where did you get it, online?

37:42.679 --> 37:44.406
I got a great desk online
one time.

37:44.407 --> 37:48.333
Uh, no.Actually, it was a gift
from my mother's boyfriend.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.738
Yeah.

37:56.605 --> 37:57.969
How'd you get home from school?

37:57.970 --> 37:59.125
Taxi.

37:59.125 --> 38:00.493
You don't have
that kind of cash.

38:00.565 --> 38:01.820
I took the bus.

38:01.820 --> 38:03.767
You don't even know
where the bus is.

38:03.767 --> 38:04.882
I walked.

38:04.882 --> 38:06.621
All the way home
from school?

38:09.046 --> 38:10.262
Do people at school know?

38:10.262 --> 38:11.305
Know what?

38:11.305 --> 38:12.792
About your sister?

38:12.792 --> 38:14.240
The whole world knows.

38:14.241 --> 38:15.049
How do they know?

38:15.049 --> 38:16.828
How does everyone know?

38:16.828 --> 38:19.731
Well, the people at school
have brothers and sisters

38:19.731 --> 38:21.327
who go to school with Amy.

38:24.061 --> 38:25.180
Welcome home, Dad.

38:25.181 --> 38:26.655
Hello, princess.

38:32.451 --> 38:35.325
I saw we had company,
so I came around the side.

38:35.853 --> 38:36.837
Whose car is that?

38:36.837 --> 38:37.892
Can he stay?

38:37.893 --> 38:39.951
Why don't you let
your father and I talk?

38:39.951 --> 38:43.267
Can't the three of us talk?
It is about the three of us,

38:43.267 --> 38:45.940
especially if Amy's
going off to Mimsy's.

38:45.941 --> 38:46.826
OK.

38:46.826 --> 38:49.294
Why don't we start with how
 you got home from school today?

38:49.733 --> 38:53.075
Right. I guess you have, um,

38:53.075 --> 38:56.768
more important things
to talk about than me.

39:01.495 --> 39:04.271
She hitched a ride with the bagboy
from the grocery store.

39:04.271 --> 39:05.349
The college kid?

39:05.529 --> 39:07.881
He saw her walking home
and picked her up.

39:08.498 --> 39:11.910
The cashier we like told me when I
 stopped in the market on the way home.

39:12.605 --> 39:14.837
She skipped school,
George.

39:15.959 --> 39:18.905
You know, maybe it
 really is time I come home.

39:18.905 --> 39:20.256
Or not.

39:20.256 --> 39:21.546
We got one daughter
who's pregnant

39:21.546 --> 39:22.816
and another one
who's skipping school.

39:22.816 --> 39:23.712
Your point being?

39:23.713 --> 39:25.888
Point being is you
need me around here

39:25.888 --> 39:27.583
Correct me if I'm wrong,

39:27.584 --> 39:30.601
but weren't you living here
when Amy got pregnant?

39:30.822 --> 39:34.086
And I'm pretty sure you were here this
 morning when Ashley skipped school.

39:34.086 --> 39:36.789
Come on. I know
we have problems,

39:36.789 --> 39:38.684
but we're not gonna fix our marriage
with me outta the house.

39:38.684 --> 39:41.951
It took me a few weeks to realize it,
 but, hey, at least I realized it.

39:41.951 --> 39:43.750
I'm not so sure I wanna fix
our marriage.

39:43.750 --> 39:46.808
Did you tell Mimsy you and I are living apart?
Does your mother know?

39:46.808 --> 39:48.271
She doesn't need
to know that.

39:48.271 --> 39:50.794
I can't imagine
she'd be too happy about it.

39:51.178 --> 39:54.070
She likes me...
better than you, even.

39:54.070 --> 39:56.248
Yeah, she likes everyone
better than me.

39:58.384 --> 40:00.277
So... Amy?

40:00.836 --> 40:03.773
She can stay there. I got
a referral for a doctor,

40:03.773 --> 40:06.232
and I met her,
she seems very nice.

40:06.279 --> 40:08.860
She's getting Amy into a group
with other teen mothers.

40:08.860 --> 40:11.536
I don't want my daughter
associating with girls like that.

40:11.831 --> 40:13.548
Come on, I wanna come home.

40:13.548 --> 40:15.143
Where are you staying now?

40:15.631 --> 40:17.129
You know, here and there.

40:17.452 --> 40:21.178
I checked our credit-card account,
 and there aren't any hotel bills on there.

40:22.790 --> 40:24.641
You're not staying
at the store, are you?

40:24.641 --> 40:26.001
Well, I'm...

40:26.725 --> 40:28.540
Yeah, I didn't think so.

40:29.043 --> 40:31.903
So why don't you slither
on back down the driveway,

40:31.903 --> 40:33.914
back to wherever it is
that you are staying?

40:35.009 --> 40:35.821
Where's Amy?

40:35.822 --> 40:37.157
She's talking to Ricky.

40:37.157 --> 40:40.132
-I told him to leave her alone.
-I told her to talk to him.

40:40.132 --> 40:41.571
We'll see who's right
about this.

40:41.571 --> 40:44.315
Call me when you need my help,
'cause you're gonna need my help.

40:44.315 --> 40:46.366
-Good night, George.
-Good night, Anne.

40:48.716 --> 40:50.063
This is my house, too,you know.

40:50.063 --> 40:51.247
Yeah, I know.

40:59.218 --> 41:00.797
I'm not saying
I'm against adoption.

41:00.797 --> 41:03.295
I'm saying I'd like to know
who's adopting, where they live,

41:03.296 --> 41:05.419
and if I can see my own kid.

41:05.967 --> 41:08.106
I really don't see why you
 should have any say in this.

41:08.106 --> 41:11.037
You and your dad
would like to ignore I even exist.

41:11.037 --> 41:14.636
You know what? I don't know
what my father said to you,

41:14.636 --> 41:17.334
but I am perfectly capable
of speaking for myself!

41:17.334 --> 41:18.437
Since when?

41:18.437 --> 41:20.269
Since I got pregnant!

41:20.269 --> 41:21.692
That's when.

41:21.959 --> 41:24.088
Since I discovered I'm going
to have to take charge

41:24.088 --> 41:26.039
of another human being's life.

41:26.798 --> 41:28.638
I might as well start
with my own.

41:28.639 --> 41:29.983
OK, OK.

41:29.983 --> 41:32.022
But I'd like to know where you are
and what's going on,

41:32.022 --> 41:33.638
if you don't mind.

41:33.639 --> 41:35.121
Maybe I do mind.

41:35.704 --> 41:39.705
I'll think about what you said,
and I'll call you.

41:40.072 --> 41:42.814
When? When are you
gonna call me?

41:42.814 --> 41:44.103
When I feel like it.

41:44.103 --> 41:46.302
OK, I'll take that.
Thanks.

41:46.303 --> 41:47.522
You're welcome.

41:48.202 --> 41:49.270
Now go home.

41:51.193 --> 41:53.316
Do you wanna exchange
phone numbers?

41:53.316 --> 41:58.148
No. I'm pretty sure I can find your number
 if and when I want to call you.

41:59.480 --> 42:00.436
Good night.

42:00.436 --> 42:01.506
Good night.

42:10.039 --> 42:10.642
What?

42:10.642 --> 42:13.250
I was hiding in the bushes.
I hope you don't mind.

42:13.250 --> 42:15.197
I was coming up the walk,
and I saw your dad pull up,

42:15.197 --> 42:18.599
and I knew Ricky was inside,
so... I got stuck.

42:19.108 --> 42:20.463
I don't mind.

42:22.607 --> 42:24.471
I don't mind at all.

42:25.744 --> 42:28.086
No, no, no. Stay.

42:29.149 --> 42:32.609
That bump - that's not me.

42:33.672 --> 42:35.455
It's the baby.

42:36.052 --> 42:37.826
Yeah, I thought so.

42:39.576 --> 42:40.799
The baby.

42:43.643 --> 42:45.413
Don't shut me out, Amy.

42:46.970 --> 42:48.817
Please don't shut me out.
