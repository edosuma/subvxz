Munsch:<i> The assault on your</i>

00:06.374 --> 00:08.273
I think you did it.

Chanel:<i> These morons need</i>

00:10.211 --> 00:12.711
<i>I am going to write the missive</i>

00:12.713 --> 00:14.880
Pete...
I can't!

00:14.882 --> 00:17.249
I don't want your first time
to be with a murderer.

00:19.887 --> 00:20.986
Wait.

00:20.988 --> 00:22.354
You're the red devil killer?

00:22.356 --> 00:23.722
No. Well, yes.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.058
W-well, no, but sort of.
Grace, you can't leave.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.526
Not until I'm done
telling you everything.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.729
Okay? I love you. I would
never, ever hurt you.

00:30.731 --> 00:31.997
I promise you're safe.
That was part of the deal.

00:31.999 --> 00:32.998
You could never be touched.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.366
Deal?

<i>I was there, doing my job--</i>
<i>snooping.</i>

00:44.812 --> 00:46.812
<i>I risked my life.</i>

00:46.814 --> 00:48.180
<i>I followed the red devil</i>

00:48.182 --> 00:49.815

00:49.817 --> 00:51.417
(panting)

00:52.753 --> 00:54.253
<i>I followed him inside,</i>

00:54.255 --> 00:56.855
<i>Saw him</i>
<i>taking off his costume.</i>

00:56.857 --> 00:58.057
It was boone.

00:58.059 --> 00:59.725
That was weeks ago.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.360
Wh-why didn't you turn him in?

01:01.362 --> 01:02.928
How many lives
could you have saved?

01:02.930 --> 01:04.430
I was... I was totally
going to, I swear.

01:04.432 --> 01:05.731
But then he started
talking to me.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.199
<i>He laid the whole thing out:</i>

01:07.201 --> 01:09.101
<i>Why he was doing</i>
<i>what he was doing,</i>

01:09.103 --> 01:12.438
<i>How kappa had to be stopped,</i>
<i>how they killed his mother,</i>

01:12.440 --> 01:16.341
<i>How they were humanity at their</i>
<i>worst, how kappa had to pay.</i>

01:16.343 --> 01:19.344
<i>And then I realized his mission</i>
<i>and our mission were the same.</i>

01:19.346 --> 01:22.347
Our mission never involved
killing anyone.

01:22.349 --> 01:24.416
Oh, really?

01:24.418 --> 01:28.187
How was that apple cider
you gave dean munsch, grace?

01:28.189 --> 01:31.757
Don't be mad at boone or me
for realizing before you did

01:31.759 --> 01:34.193
That the only way to
really, really bring chanel

01:34.195 --> 01:36.562
And her type down was
bringing them all the way

01:36.564 --> 01:39.131
Down to the ground,
<i>under</i> the ground.

01:39.133 --> 01:41.800
Everybody thinks
the red devil--

01:41.802 --> 01:43.902
"ooh, he's the bad guy
in all of this."

01:43.904 --> 01:46.205
But, no, he's not the monster.
No, no, no, no, no.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.107
The kappas.
The chanels.

01:48.109 --> 01:49.875
The dinosaur of
a greek system.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.810
They are the beast.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.412
More than half of students

01:53.414 --> 01:55.380
That join sororities
or fraternities get hazed,

01:55.382 --> 01:57.716
And it's not just wearing
raw chickens on their heads

01:57.718 --> 02:00.319
And calling each other gay slurs
while jumping around naked.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.988
And let's just put aside
the psychological damage

02:02.990 --> 02:05.324
Done to each and every
one of them that were just

02:05.326 --> 02:07.326
Looking for a
place to belong,

02:07.328 --> 02:08.927
And instead spent months
being verbally abused

02:08.929 --> 02:10.295
About being a pound overweight

02:10.297 --> 02:12.464
Or not having the right
pair of air jordans.

02:14.502 --> 02:17.503
104 deaths, grace.

02:17.505 --> 02:22.508
104 deaths and counting
since 1970.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.776
I mean, how many
has the red devil killed, huh?

02:24.778 --> 02:25.978
Eight? Ten, maybe?

02:25.980 --> 02:27.613
(chuckles):
I mean, come on.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.648
It's not even
a competition.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.317
That beast is going to keep on
feeding on young lives

02:32.319 --> 02:35.254
Until someone cuts
its highlight-covered head off.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.989
Oh, and besides,

02:36.991 --> 02:38.790
Boone said there were
other killers, too.

02:38.792 --> 02:41.026
It was a conspiracy.
If I turned him in,

02:41.028 --> 02:43.095
We would have never
found out who they were.

02:43.097 --> 02:45.030
Stop rationalizing it.

02:45.032 --> 02:47.366
You killed people.
You are not allowed to just say,

02:47.368 --> 02:50.869
"yeah, but I had
a super good reason for it."

02:50.871 --> 02:52.171
Who did you kill?

03:04.285 --> 03:06.285
Roger:
This feels so good.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.821
(kissing gently)

03:09.823 --> 03:11.423
Roger.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.033

03:25.072 --> 03:26.672
Pete:
Or d-dodger.

03:26.674 --> 03:29.174
I-I don't know.
I get them all mixed up.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.176
Hey, hey, hey!
Grace, grace, no.

03:31.178 --> 03:33.212
Grace. Grace.

03:33.214 --> 03:35.681
(panting)

03:35.683 --> 03:37.249
What, are you gonna kill me now?

03:37.251 --> 03:39.718
No. I would never hurt you.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.186
I just can't let you leave.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.888
Not until I'm done
telling you everything!

03:44.858 --> 03:46.758
(knife clatters on floor)

03:49.930 --> 03:51.897
I really liked you, pete.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.832
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Stop, stop, stop, stop...

03:53.834 --> 03:56.268
No, no, I'm not letting you go
from my life that easily, grace.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.269
Stop.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.037
Grace. I know that

03:59.039 --> 04:00.606
If you could just...
Stop.

04:00.608 --> 04:03.108
...Hear what I have
to say, to understand...
Please.

04:03.110 --> 04:05.711
...Why I did what I did,
you could still love me.

04:05.713 --> 04:06.912
(sobbing)

04:06.914 --> 04:09.915
That guy, roger,

04:09.917 --> 04:12.184
Was terrible to his brother,
did you know that?

04:12.186 --> 04:14.186
His whole life.
(sniffles)

04:14.188 --> 04:16.888
He-he ripped off dodger's
left nipple in utero.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.624
Don't try to
justify it all

04:18.626 --> 04:20.125
After the fact.
You were just mad

04:20.127 --> 04:22.194
That the dickie dollars
scholars rejected you.

04:22.196 --> 04:24.096
Of course I was. They're just
as bad as the kappa girls.

04:24.098 --> 04:26.431
But, grace, you have to
understand, I had no choice.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.734
No, no, no, no, no!
<i>They showed up one day</i>
<i>thinking that I was</i>

04:28.736 --> 04:29.935
<i>A double agent,</i>
<i>that I couldn't be trusted.</i>

04:29.937 --> 04:31.536
<i>They were going to kill me.</i>

04:31.538 --> 04:33.405
Hey, hey, you can trust me,
you can trust me!

04:33.407 --> 04:36.541
Ask me and I'll do anything.
I'll prove it.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.243
<i>It was roger or me.</i>

04:38.245 --> 04:41.613
Don't you see
that they did that on purpose?!

04:41.615 --> 04:43.215
They knew that if you
actually killed someone,

04:43.217 --> 04:44.816
You would be their slave!

04:44.818 --> 04:46.785
God!
We were the good guys.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.420
We were in this together!

04:48.422 --> 04:50.255
I did this for you.

04:50.257 --> 04:51.990
Don't you understand?

04:51.992 --> 04:54.660
I did this to be
one of the good guys, grace.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.428
I mean, come on.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.996
You practically told me to.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.966
Don't you remember driving back
from seeing mandy?

05:00.968 --> 05:03.235
Grace: The more I hear
about this whole thing,

05:03.237 --> 05:05.737
The more I'm starting to think
the idea that there are good

05:05.739 --> 05:07.606
And bad people in the world
is just something

05:07.608 --> 05:09.941
Adults use to get children
to stay in line.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.244
Mm. Well,
nietzsche said,

05:12.246 --> 05:13.845
(imitates matthew mcconaughey):
"you have your way,

05:13.847 --> 05:14.846
"I have my way.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.615
"as for the right way,

05:16.617 --> 05:19.184
"the correct way
and the only way,

05:19.186 --> 05:20.752
It does not exist."

05:20.754 --> 05:22.120
Exactly.

05:22.122 --> 05:24.690
I mean, how can you
possibly stop an evil

05:24.692 --> 05:27.993
As old as kappa house while
you're playing by the rules?

05:27.995 --> 05:30.829
I mean, aren't we being naive?

05:30.831 --> 05:33.365
What are you
suggesting?

05:33.367 --> 05:35.033
I don't know.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.469
It's just...

05:37.471 --> 05:39.705
(sighs)

05:39.707 --> 05:41.707
...Maybe the red devil
has the right idea.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.675
(car horn blaring)

05:43.677 --> 05:45.911
You took me literally?

05:47.281 --> 05:49.681
If you gaze long enough
into an abyss,

05:49.683 --> 05:53.285
That abyss
will gaze back into you.

05:55.289 --> 05:56.955
That is nietzsche, too, grace.

05:56.957 --> 06:00.192
You're quoting nietzsche?
Seriously?

06:00.194 --> 06:01.660
You are already
a murderer, pete,

06:01.662 --> 06:03.628
You don't have to be
a douche as well!

06:03.630 --> 06:06.398
This is not a
philosophy course.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.967
This is murder-- serial murder!

06:12.139 --> 06:14.706
I agree.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.576
Which is why I decided
to make it all stop.

06:19.513 --> 06:20.879
So I killed boone.

Except for shooting chanel
with the crossbow

06:57.184 --> 07:00.419
And then that other police guy,
but that was self-defense.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.454
That was you?

07:16.236 --> 07:19.037
Grace.

07:19.039 --> 07:22.073
I had to finish
that part of it.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.743
The only way to justify

Pete: Are you sure
this is what you want?

07:54.441 --> 07:57.175
I was vulnerable enough to share
my darkest fetish with you,

07:57.177 --> 07:59.444
And now you're making me
feel self-conscious.

07:59.446 --> 08:02.280
Just come in and take me now.

08:02.282 --> 08:05.584

What self-respecting man
wouldn't do

08:36.016 --> 08:39.551
Anything to get revenge
for being degraded like that?

08:39.553 --> 08:41.887
Unfortunately, I don't have
great aim with a crossbow

08:41.889 --> 08:44.022
And I can't see anything
in that mask.

08:45.492 --> 08:48.126
I don't want to be here anymore.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.895
I feel sick.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.396
This isn't what I wanted.

08:51.398 --> 08:55.033
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

08:55.035 --> 08:58.737
Okay? Don't judge me for what
we both know had to happen.

08:58.739 --> 09:01.406
Don't you see
I did this all for you?

09:01.408 --> 09:03.642
For us?

09:03.644 --> 09:05.210
To give you what you wanted,

09:05.212 --> 09:07.579
To clean up the whole mess
that chanel made of kappa.

09:07.581 --> 09:11.550
You know what?
Let's just run away together.

09:11.552 --> 09:13.351
You and me.
Forget everything.

09:13.353 --> 09:16.221
Let the other killer
finish what we started.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.490
Don't you see
how much I love you?

09:18.492 --> 09:20.559
Don't you see what I'm willing
to do for you?

09:20.561 --> 09:23.662
I hate you, pete.

09:23.664 --> 09:27.933
You are everything I have
been fighting against.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.502
I never want to
see you again.

09:30.504 --> 09:32.904
If you want
me to stay,

09:32.906 --> 09:34.973
You're gonna
have to kill me.

09:38.011 --> 09:40.045
(door opens)

09:40.047 --> 09:42.347
But if you leave,
I won't be able to tell you

No, it isn't.
Look at its markings.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.280
What markings?
This is a sweater.

18:14.727 --> 18:17.128
I understand that what you're
going through is really intense.

18:17.130 --> 18:21.065
And I know you and I haven't
really always seen eye to eye,

18:21.067 --> 18:23.367
And you say crazy-mean stuff
to me all the time,

18:23.369 --> 18:25.736
And I have a real problem
with your casual racism,

18:25.738 --> 18:27.939
Which is something
we need to work on,

18:27.941 --> 18:30.475
But, girl, I promise
I got your back.

18:30.477 --> 18:31.876

18:34.981 --> 18:36.481
But things are gonna get better.

18:36.483 --> 18:38.783
You're young,
smart and beautiful,

18:38.785 --> 18:40.952
And you got a lot of

18:40.954 --> 18:43.421
So don't talk
about killing yourself, okay?

18:43.423 --> 18:45.556
That's not even something
you should joke about.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.792
Come here.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.160
Maybe this is

18:49.162 --> 18:51.229
One of those teachable moments,
you know?

18:51.231 --> 18:53.331
Like my grandmama says.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.567
Maybe this is where you learn
the lesson that...

18:56.569 --> 19:00.071
Words really mean something
and they can hurt people,

19:00.073 --> 19:02.240
So you just
can't always

19:02.242 --> 19:03.774
Say the first horrible thing

19:03.776 --> 19:05.409
That pops into your head
all the time.

19:05.411 --> 19:07.178
That's gonna be so hard.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.646
I know.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.416
Why are you being
so nice to me?

19:12.418 --> 19:15.186
Because we have
a real opportunity here.

19:15.188 --> 19:18.856
I mean, I think it's safe to say
that you and this house

19:18.858 --> 19:20.625
Have hit rock bottom.

19:20.627 --> 19:23.294
And when things can't seem
to get any worse,

19:23.296 --> 19:25.196
That's when they start
to get better.

19:25.198 --> 19:28.266
We're co-presidents,
remember?

19:28.268 --> 19:30.668
That means this is the moment
where you and I join forces

19:30.670 --> 19:32.870
To catch this killer
and rebuild kappa kappa tau

19:32.872 --> 19:35.540
Into being something
everybody can be proud of.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.175
And we're gonna do it together.

19:39.112 --> 19:40.478
Fine.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.812
I'm in.

19:41.814 --> 19:44.015
Whatever it takes.

19:45.985 --> 19:49.587

Rip off his mask!

20:16.082 --> 20:17.148
(screaming)

20:17.150 --> 20:18.382
Please!

20:18.384 --> 20:20.017
She made me do it!

20:20.019 --> 20:21.185
Who?! Who made you do it?!
Get me out of this suit!

20:21.187 --> 20:22.386
Have you seen this guy before?

20:22.388 --> 20:23.554
No!

20:23.556 --> 20:24.722
(screaming)

20:24.724 --> 20:26.891
He smells like a pizza parlor.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.759
(shouts)
get me out of this suit!

20:28.761 --> 20:30.361
(muffled shouting)

20:30.363 --> 20:31.762
Bitches, gather round.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.764
What the hell
is going on?
Who is that guy?

20:33.766 --> 20:36.000
We have no idea. Neither of
us have seen him before.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.401
Yeah. It was so weird.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.769
As soon as zayday
and I joined forces,

20:38.771 --> 20:40.538
He just fell
into our lap.

20:40.540 --> 20:43.841
Guys, something really weird
happened, and I'm so unsettled.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.943
No one cares!
We just caught the killer!

20:45.945 --> 20:47.778
No, listen!
I was getting my fitbit steps in

20:47.780 --> 20:49.280
When this girl appeared out
of nowhere

20:49.282 --> 20:50.915
With a shawl covering her face.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.450
Oh, great news. The hag
of shady lane has a sister.

20:52.452 --> 20:53.851
No one cares.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.354
No, she had scars
all over her face.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.689
She probably had bad acne
and wanted beauty tips from us.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.225
It was terrifying.
She was carrying a shovel!

21:01.227 --> 21:03.294
There's nothing terrifying
about that.

21:03.296 --> 21:05.196
She kept saying something,
something "dork."

21:05.198 --> 21:06.764
Saying I'm-I'm a dork

21:06.766 --> 21:07.798
Or something "dork."

21:07.800 --> 21:09.367
Number six, hi.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.535
Everyone on campus but me
is a dork!

21:11.537 --> 21:13.671
You're always trying
to pull focus!

21:15.808 --> 21:17.441
(man groans)

21:17.443 --> 21:18.442
Any last words?

21:18.444 --> 21:21.412
(muffled grunting)

21:21.414 --> 21:23.414
(panting)

21:23.416 --> 21:24.649
I'm gonna explode.

21:24.651 --> 21:26.117
What?

21:26.119 --> 21:27.952
We should probably let him
use the bathroom.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.420
No! I'm gonna explode!

21:29.422 --> 21:30.554
(panting)

21:30.556 --> 21:32.156
I'm just a delivery guy!

21:32.158 --> 21:34.091
(doorbell rings)

21:34.093 --> 21:35.793
<i>I delivered a pizza to this</i>
<i>address and someone answered</i>

21:35.795 --> 21:38.562
<i>The door in this costume!</i>
Pizza!

21:38.564 --> 21:39.630
Wait, there's pizza?

21:39.632 --> 21:40.631
When I woke up,

21:40.633 --> 21:42.233
I was wrapped in dynamite!

21:45.571 --> 21:47.938
(all gasping)

21:47.940 --> 21:49.573
Oh, my god,
it's a bomb.

21:49.575 --> 21:52.610
(all screaming)

21:52.612 --> 21:54.312
She had a low voice,
like a machine.

21:54.314 --> 21:57.248
(beeping)
she said she... The only way
she wouldn't kill me is

21:57.250 --> 21:59.850
If I came in here and I killed
everyone. And if I didn't,

21:59.852 --> 22:01.252
She'd detonate the bomb!

22:01.254 --> 22:02.086
(beep)

22:02.088 --> 22:04.188
(all screaming)

22:07.160 --> 22:08.192
(beep)

22:08.194 --> 22:10.261
(distorted screaming)

22:16.836 --> 22:18.102
(beep)

22:26.479 --> 22:28.312
(beeping)

22:28.314 --> 22:30.114
(electronic giggling)

22:35.288 --> 22:37.621
(distorted screaming)

22:47.567 --> 22:50.701
(distorted screaming continues)

22:58.511 --> 23:01.479
(filtered breathing,
indistinct conversations)

23:01.481 --> 23:05.149
(equipment beeping)

23:05.151 --> 23:07.251
Chanel #5:
I just don't understand.

23:07.253 --> 23:08.853
Like, one minute he's here,

23:08.855 --> 23:10.821
And then the next minute
he just explodes!

23:10.823 --> 23:13.657
I know. I also was there.

23:13.659 --> 23:15.092
I mean, it's just so messed up.

23:15.094 --> 23:17.762
Like, what are we
supposed to do now?

23:17.764 --> 23:20.264
Yes, a totally innocent man
who seemed super nice

23:20.266 --> 23:22.066
And probably did
nothing wrong at all

23:22.068 --> 23:24.335
Just got blown up
in our living room.

23:24.337 --> 23:28.339
Bummer. Now, let's honor
his memory by moving on.

23:28.341 --> 23:29.407
(crying)

23:29.409 --> 23:31.709
What's wrong with her?

23:31.711 --> 23:34.545
Number five is bumming me out
by insisting that we relive

23:34.547 --> 23:38.682
The moment the pizza guy blew up
over and over and over!

23:38.684 --> 23:41.685
Can you not make it about
you for one second?!

23:41.687 --> 23:43.254
No, guys, I'm really
freaked out! I feel like

23:43.256 --> 23:44.622
I'm having a
panic attack!

23:44.624 --> 23:46.557
Get it together,
number five!

23:46.559 --> 23:48.426
Stop wallowing and
start concentrating

23:48.428 --> 23:50.528
On what's really
important here.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.530
Restoring my reputation.

23:53.466 --> 23:54.765
Is that what's really important?

23:54.767 --> 23:56.534
Listen...

23:56.536 --> 23:58.369
Ever since zayday saved my life

23:58.371 --> 24:00.104
From the fake asp
I ordered online,

24:00.106 --> 24:01.772
I'm a changed woman.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.974
Like, I get now
that other people have feelings,

24:03.976 --> 24:06.944
And that words, they're like
weapons or something.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.580
So, I figured out a plan

24:09.582 --> 24:12.116
To restore kappa house's
dignity, get back chad radwell,

24:12.118 --> 24:14.452
And put me back into the hearts

24:14.454 --> 24:16.387
Of the citizens
of this great nation.

24:16.389 --> 24:19.490
Wait, so... (sighs) the plan
isn't to catch the killer?

24:19.492 --> 24:21.258
No! We already know
who the killer is!

24:21.260 --> 24:23.260
It's boone!
If we don't want him to kill us,

24:23.262 --> 24:25.729
We just have to avoid places
where gay people go.

24:25.731 --> 24:28.399
So, like,
behind every bennigan's.

24:28.401 --> 24:29.767
I love bennigan's.

24:29.769 --> 24:31.101
(sputters)
so what's the plan?

24:31.103 --> 24:33.370
I need to go on an apology tour.

24:34.607 --> 24:35.906
You know, like celebrities,

24:35.908 --> 24:37.141
When they say
something offensive,

24:37.143 --> 24:38.576
They just go on tv
and apologize,

24:38.578 --> 24:39.977
And everybody forgives them,

24:39.979 --> 24:41.912
Even though
they don't mean it at all.

24:41.914 --> 24:43.447
The first person I'm gonna

24:43.449 --> 24:44.448
Apologize to...

24:44.450 --> 24:45.449
Me.

24:45.451 --> 24:47.117
...Melanie dorkus.

24:47.119 --> 24:49.019
What?
Yes. You heard
what number six said.

24:49.021 --> 24:51.021
Clearly melanie dorkus
is stalking the campus

24:51.023 --> 24:53.524
With a shovel in a veil,
all pissed off because her face

24:53.526 --> 24:56.160
Got burnt off, and I want
to let bygones be bygones.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.828
But I thought that you said
that you weren't the person

24:57.830 --> 24:59.296
Who put the acid
in the spray tanner.

24:59.298 --> 25:01.098
Well, I didn't,
but she thinks I did.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.534
So here's the plan:
We're gonna go to her house,

25:03.536 --> 25:05.870
I'm gonna fake apologize,
you'll record it,

25:05.872 --> 25:07.872
We'll post it online,
and it'll all be fine.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.173
Wait, we're gonna what?

25:09.175 --> 25:10.407
Let's go.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.313
(crying): Like, after roger
and dodger, like,

25:16.315 --> 25:18.649
I've suffered so much
loss in my life.
Oh, jesus. Let's go.

25:18.651 --> 25:21.886
Why do you think
the devil let me live?

25:21.888 --> 25:23.988
Wes:
I don't know.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.357
But I still think we
should call the police.

25:26.359 --> 25:28.792
What will that do?
I mean, all denise is gonna do

25:28.794 --> 25:29.994
Is arrest zayday again.

25:29.996 --> 25:32.329
(sighs)

25:32.331 --> 25:34.398
Um... (clears throat)

25:36.802 --> 25:39.470
You guys didn't, um...

25:39.472 --> 25:40.571
What?

25:41.541 --> 25:43.240
(whistles)

25:43.242 --> 25:45.309
No. Dad. No.

25:45.311 --> 25:47.745
Didn't.
Okay, I had to ask.

25:47.747 --> 25:50.180
I was going to, though,

25:50.182 --> 25:53.083
And it felt
right and...
That's nice. Mm-hmm.

25:53.085 --> 25:56.420
Oh, my god. I mean,
can you imagine if I had?

25:56.422 --> 25:58.355
I mean, what is so wrong
with me, dad,

25:58.357 --> 25:59.890
That I totally misread him?

26:01.861 --> 26:05.095
I think you saw
what you wanted to see.

26:05.097 --> 26:07.531
And from the sounds of it,

26:07.533 --> 26:09.533
You know,
at least he was coming

26:09.535 --> 26:12.336
From a-a loving
and-and positive place.

26:12.338 --> 26:15.739
You can't kill people from
a loving and positive place.

26:15.741 --> 26:18.409
Well, obviously, but...

26:18.411 --> 26:20.878
I just didn't want
this experience to stop you

26:20.880 --> 26:22.413
From trusting your instincts.

26:22.415 --> 26:25.583
Pete was a good guy.

26:25.585 --> 26:27.952
Solid, hardworking, handsome.

26:27.954 --> 26:30.588
And, yes, I'm glad
he wasn't your first.

26:30.590 --> 26:33.791
But aside from the
in-cahoots-with-killers thing,

26:33.793 --> 26:35.726
I think you made a good choice

26:35.728 --> 26:37.127
When you considered him.

26:37.129 --> 26:39.263
Invasion of the
dad bod snatchers.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.698
Who are you?

26:40.700 --> 26:42.132
(chuckles)

26:42.134 --> 26:44.969
That's a good question.

26:44.971 --> 26:46.971
I'm a guy

26:46.973 --> 26:50.541
Who's learning to loosen the
leash and trust his daughter.

26:50.543 --> 26:52.743
And if all of this

26:52.745 --> 26:54.712
Has taught me anything,

26:54.714 --> 26:57.948
It's that I can't protect you
from the world.

26:59.585 --> 27:01.251
And that you're pretty bad-ass

27:01.253 --> 27:03.087
When it comes
to taking care of yourself.

27:03.089 --> 27:05.422
Well...

27:05.424 --> 27:07.958
What I've learned
is that I still need my dad.

27:07.960 --> 27:11.061
Especially if I want
to catch the killer.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.396
Boone and
pete are dead,

27:12.398 --> 27:14.298
So there's
only one left.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.400
The girl in
the bathtub.

27:16.402 --> 27:18.068
Pete said it's
one of my sisters,

27:18.070 --> 27:20.104
Which means we narrowed
it down to five.
Mm-hmm.

27:20.106 --> 27:21.772
And, well, there's only
one way to figure out

27:21.774 --> 27:22.940
Which one of
them it is.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.008
Lie detectors.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.110
No, dad...
Waterboarding.

27:26.112 --> 27:27.811
That's illegal.
If it's good enough

27:27.813 --> 27:29.013
For the cia,
it's good enough for me.

27:29.015 --> 27:30.581
(laughing):
Dad...

27:30.583 --> 27:32.416
Okay, I have a better idea.

27:32.418 --> 27:35.452
Why don't we lock ourselves
in here, and then we just wait

27:35.454 --> 27:37.454
For the killer
to kill the other four...

27:37.456 --> 27:38.889
Okay, dad...

27:40.593 --> 27:43.494
I need to get as
much information

27:43.496 --> 27:45.462
On all of them
as possible.

27:45.464 --> 27:48.666
Okay. Um, how do we do that?

27:48.668 --> 27:50.968
Dad...

40:07.906 --> 40:11.040
Who confirmed that you,
melanie dorkus,

40:11.042 --> 40:12.776
Took a seaplane back to campus

40:12.778 --> 40:14.511
One week before
the killings started.

40:14.513 --> 40:15.545
So?

40:15.547 --> 40:16.913
So, you're obviously the killer!

40:16.915 --> 40:19.249
You came back from your
weird arctic compound

40:19.251 --> 40:21.785
To get revenge on kappa house
because you're hideous

40:21.787 --> 40:24.087
And think that I put
acid in your spray tanner

40:24.089 --> 40:25.422
When I didn't!
(grunts)

40:25.424 --> 40:27.390
I don't know
what you're talking about!

40:27.392 --> 40:29.426
I didn't kill anybody!
Can it, dorkus.

40:29.428 --> 40:31.060
I know it was you.

40:31.062 --> 40:33.029
Have fun in hell, bitch.

40:33.031 --> 40:36.065
And fyi, this is probably
gonna hurt a lot.
(gasps)

40:36.067 --> 40:38.735
Wait! Chanel! Stop! Stop, stop,
stop! She's not the killer.

40:38.737 --> 40:40.437
What are you talking
about? Of course she is!

40:40.439 --> 40:43.306
No, she's not. I swear.
We have proof.

40:43.308 --> 40:44.741
It's hester.

40:44.743 --> 40:47.811
Hester is
the red devil.

40:50.549 --> 40:52.081
(chuckles)

40:52.083 --> 40:53.483
So sorry.

40:53.485 --> 40:56.252
(whispers):
Stop recording!

40:56.254 --> 40:59.122
I knew that bitch was a nut
burger the minute I met her.

40:59.124 --> 41:01.458
It's like, who wears
a neck brace like that in 2015?

41:01.460 --> 41:03.226
You know, who are you?
Forrest gump?

41:03.228 --> 41:04.961
That's why
you gave her a makeover

41:04.963 --> 41:06.629
And made her one
of your minions?

41:06.631 --> 41:08.898
Chanel: Have you not noticed
the chanels operate in a world

41:08.900 --> 41:10.567
That is outside
the laws of man?

41:10.569 --> 41:12.302
She has to show back
up here eventually.

41:12.304 --> 41:13.736
We need to
devise a trap.

41:13.738 --> 41:15.171
But remember, she's
armed and dangerous.

41:15.173 --> 41:16.172
(woman screams in distance)

41:16.174 --> 41:17.474
(chanel #3 screams)

41:36.027 --> 41:37.827
(gasping)

41:37.829 --> 41:40.330
Did you hear that? I think
it came from chanel's closet.

41:40.332 --> 41:42.332
Number five,
what are you doing here?!

41:42.334 --> 41:44.868
Oh, please tell me
you did not bring your insane

41:44.870 --> 41:46.703
And obviously blind
tinder hookup back here.

41:46.705 --> 41:48.204
I mean, the last thing
I need to see right now

41:48.206 --> 41:49.606
Is a guy running
out of your room

41:49.608 --> 41:50.940
With his index finger
bitten off.

41:50.942 --> 41:52.442
You know,
'cause your vagina has teeth.

41:52.444 --> 41:54.711
No. It was a fake,
and I should have known,

41:54.713 --> 41:56.346
Because his tinder
profile picture

41:56.348 --> 41:58.114
Is the guy from nickelback
cut out of a magazine.

41:58.116 --> 41:59.716
You're saying
you would have been okay

41:59.718 --> 42:01.818
If it was the guy
from nickelback?

42:01.820 --> 42:03.887
He's, like, 60.
And canadian.

42:03.889 --> 42:05.822
I lost my virginity
to a nickelback song.

42:05.824 --> 42:07.857
Grace: Okay, can we please
stop talking

42:07.859 --> 42:10.159
About chanel #5's dating life
and see who's screaming?

42:10.161 --> 42:11.294
Come on.

42:17.669 --> 42:19.869
(whimpering)

42:27.178 --> 42:29.245
(women gasping)

42:31.182 --> 42:34.017
Grace: Oh, my god.

42:34.019 --> 42:36.052
Chanel #3:
Is she dead?

42:36.054 --> 42:37.487
This is so horrible!

42:37.489 --> 42:39.522
I know. That was such
a fabulous pair of shoes.

42:39.524 --> 42:41.257
I can't feel a pulse.

42:41.259 --> 42:42.325
Grace: This doesn't
make any sense.

42:42.327 --> 42:44.060
Hester is the killer.

42:44.062 --> 42:46.396
Pete's dead, boone's dead.
Who could have done this to her?

42:46.398 --> 42:48.698
(hester gasps sharply,
women gasp)

42:48.700 --> 42:50.667
(panting)

42:51.603 --> 42:53.770
(gasping)

42:53.772 --> 42:57.173
Red... Devil!

42:57.175 --> 42:59.409
(whimpering)

43:02.280 --> 43:03.513
(gasps)

43:08.954 --> 43:10.286
(gasps)

43:47.258 --> 43:49.325
