Solar mirror
successfully attached.

00:09.108 --> 00:12.054
With Lukrum Industries'
commitment to our terraforming efforts,

00:12.273 --> 00:14.296
we are making Mars habitable.

00:14.374 --> 00:16.897
Hey, nice
work on that elevator.

00:17.598 --> 00:20.048
Why don't you come work with us,
put your skills to real use?

00:20.173 --> 00:23.639
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm needed in my colony.

00:23.915 --> 00:25.640
Robert. We can't.

00:26.558 --> 00:28.117
I am scared.

00:28.430 --> 00:29.509
The baby's
going to be fine.

00:29.586 --> 00:31.890
Our camp's been hit
by some kind of contagion.

00:32.045 --> 00:33.595
Made a bunch of my guys sick.

00:33.681 --> 00:36.437
Cameron.
He's gone.

00:36.960 --> 00:39.200
I can't put one
more person in the ground!

00:39.959 --> 00:42.101
You're
still mourning Joon.

00:42.715 --> 00:46.648
Secretary General, Commander Seung
is suffering from depression relating to

00:46.726 --> 00:48.265
the death of her sister.

00:48.554 --> 00:52.101
It's my opinion that this
colony requires new leadership.

We see no need to address the

01:38.201 --> 01:41.179
IMSF has full confidence
in Commander Seung,

01:41.320 --> 01:44.242
as do I,
having worked alongside her

01:44.320 --> 01:47.445
there and here in my current
capacity as secretary general.

01:47.523 --> 01:50.851
I've come to trust her judgment and
understanding of the complexities of the

01:50.929 --> 01:52.413
current situation.

01:52.897 --> 01:55.906
Thank you for your

Zoom in. Sector 12,

02:15.973 --> 02:17.879
Right there, what does
that look like to you?

02:17.973 --> 02:19.672
Is that, water?

02:19.838 --> 02:21.730
Liquid water.

02:22.808 --> 02:24.152
At least we think it is.

02:24.265 --> 02:26.129
Satellite picked
it up this morning.

02:27.145 --> 02:28.417
Incredible.

02:28.798 --> 02:31.941
Thermal readouts are inconclusive, but
if it is, it's the first real proof that

02:32.019 --> 02:33.769
our terraforming
efforts are working.

02:33.873 --> 02:35.402
I meant your smile.

02:36.538 --> 02:38.465
It's nice to see again.

02:39.443 --> 02:41.002
Anyway, at this point,

02:41.080 --> 02:43.570
I will take any sign of
progress I can get.

02:43.648 --> 02:44.738
Me too.

02:44.816 --> 02:48.418
And once IMSF see this, maybe they
finally let me start building again.

02:50.568 --> 02:53.338
Has the board even looked
at my expansion proposal?

02:53.408 --> 02:54.613
They have.

02:55.138 --> 02:56.816
Your plans were rejected.

02:57.245 --> 02:58.386
For now.

02:58.464 --> 03:01.879
It's just with what's happened in the
last few months, it isn't the right time.

03:02.176 --> 03:05.277
Sure. I, I understand.

03:06.398 --> 03:08.838
Come with me, to
check out the water.

03:09.152 --> 03:12.136
It might do us some good to get
out, see if this thing is real.

03:15.148 --> 03:18.136
<i>In an unprecedented
move, Russia has brokered an independent</i>

03:18.214 --> 03:22.644
<i>mineral rights deal with the billionaire
Roland St. Johns of Lukrum Industries,</i>

03:22.722 --> 03:26.052
<i>allowing for exclusive ownership
on materials on Mars.</i>

03:26.130 --> 03:28.683
<i>The resources found there
will be extracted by the</i>

03:28.761 --> 03:30.751
<i>company's mining colony,
which is expected to...</i>

03:30.868 --> 03:32.230
Can you believe this?

03:32.508 --> 03:33.730
Actually, I can.

03:33.808 --> 03:35.910
<i>The agreement
challenges most interpretations of the</i>

03:35.988 --> 03:39.743
<i>international space treaty, and may open
the flood gates to other companies and</i>

03:39.821 --> 03:42.861
<i>countries staking their
own claims on the planet.</i>

03:43.902 --> 03:46.785
It concerns me
that the exploration of

03:46.863 --> 03:49.496
space has gone from an
international effort

03:49.574 --> 03:54.761
on the part of governments, to an
effort on the part of corporations.

03:55.113 --> 03:58.480
Zero,
zero, zero, niner, eight.

03:58.751 --> 04:03.605
When we landed on the moon, we
claimed to come for all mankind.

04:03.903 --> 04:09.753
That's one small step for
man, one giant leap for mankind.

04:09.974 --> 04:17.572
But that spirit is difficult to
feel in the context of corporations,

04:17.688 --> 04:20.541
because their
priorities are elsewhere.

04:20.837 --> 04:24.409
Yes, of course the first people will be
scientists, and you'll feel this incredible

04:24.487 --> 04:27.067
rush of global patriotism.

04:27.198 --> 04:29.745
We're all one species, and
look what we were able to do.

04:29.857 --> 04:36.102
But very quickly, as we start populating
Mars, the big multinational conglomerates

04:36.180 --> 04:40.159
are going to show up, and they're
going to largely do what they want.

04:41.376 --> 04:47.436
It's very similar to a small resource-rich
country, where a handful of companies

04:47.514 --> 04:50.530
dominate all of
the decision-making.

04:50.608 --> 04:55.042
And dominate the path
that that country follows.

04:55.648 --> 05:00.198
And we've seen that play out again and
again and again, across the world.

05:00.979 --> 05:04.410
<i>Look at Exxon's
operations, Equatorial Guinea, Chad,</i>

05:04.488 --> 05:06.035
<i>Venezuela, Indonesia.</i>

05:06.113 --> 05:09.644
<i>This deal gives
UK's Royal Dutch Shell access to BP's</i>

05:09.722 --> 05:14.370
<i>multibillion-dollar projects in East Africa,
Australia, Brazil, and other markets.</i>

05:14.448 --> 05:18.113
You have oil companies that, in
order to extract resources in places like

05:18.191 --> 05:23.370
Africa and elsewhere, they have to cut a
deal with whomever is in charge of the

05:23.448 --> 05:27.448
government, in order to
have access to that resource.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.430
Corporations have become
immensely powerful in our society.

05:30.508 --> 05:34.831
We have a lot of private companies that
are bigger than national governments,

05:34.909 --> 05:36.964
and whole economies.

05:37.172 --> 05:41.105
The problem with that is a lot of
these companies work in such secrecy.

05:41.206 --> 05:42.961
And so we don't really
know what they're doing.

05:43.038 --> 05:45.277
<i>Right now
there are plaintiffs who have</i>

05:45.355 --> 05:48.191
<i>sued Shell for what
happened to them.</i>

05:48.268 --> 05:51.590
<i>Being shot by soldiers in the
Nigerian army, abducted and tortured.</i>

05:51.668 --> 05:53.816
<i>According to
Ecuador's ordered the oil giant,</i>

05:53.893 --> 05:57.026
<i>Chevron, to pay $8 billion
in damages for pollution.</i>

05:57.125 --> 06:00.956
That oil flow out of the ground in
Chad, which has been so good for Exxon,

06:01.113 --> 06:06.370
it has led to Chad's dictator spending
at least $4 billion on weapons.

06:06.461 --> 06:08.519
There's something
called the resource curse.

06:08.865 --> 06:15.605
Countries that are rich in resources are
often the least economically developed,

06:15.792 --> 06:18.277
the most prone towards war.

06:18.511 --> 06:23.253
There's no regulatory regime,
there's no legal structure.

06:23.394 --> 06:25.331
And the companies are leading.

06:25.691 --> 06:28.925
Whether we're talking about Earth,
or whether we're talking about Mars,

06:29.003 --> 06:33.909
we need to be very, very careful about
granting powers to corporations.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.698
Particularly when
they're working

06:35.821 --> 06:38.643
in new environments,
because the focus of a company

06:38.721 --> 06:42.823
is always going to be on the shareholders,
not on the people that live there.

06:43.198 --> 06:44.843
Nothing is a clean slate.

06:44.921 --> 06:47.307
We impose ourselves
on everything.

06:47.622 --> 06:50.284
And so the big
corporations will

06:50.517 --> 06:54.417
see Mars as an unfettered
regulatory environment.

06:54.578 --> 06:57.573
And that will probably
set some precedents

06:57.683 --> 07:01.012
and some rules that'll
make the Wild West

07:01.090 --> 07:03.057
seem quaint.

07:03.652 --> 07:06.877
<i>No word on how this
affects Russia's involvement in the IMSF</i>

07:06.955 --> 07:10.128
<i>coalition, but
withdrawal appears likely.</i>

07:13.686 --> 07:18.206
Hey! I get it,
you're frustrated.

07:18.432 --> 07:19.738
I am too.

07:20.354 --> 07:23.839
Feels like watching Lukrum dismantle
us right before our eyes.

07:23.971 --> 07:26.978
Yes, and making us look
foolish and weak in the process.

07:27.518 --> 07:29.050
But we are, aren't we?

07:29.278 --> 07:30.761
Weak.

07:31.068 --> 07:34.901
Not you and me, but the
leadership, on both planets.

07:35.494 --> 07:38.113
They've put us in this situation, and we're
going to lose everything we've worked

07:38.190 --> 07:39.893
for if we don't do
something about it.

07:40.032 --> 07:42.409
I'm in no
position taking a stance.

07:42.495 --> 07:43.690
Not anymore.

07:43.768 --> 07:44.862
I disagree.

07:44.940 --> 07:48.784
We owe it to ourselves and
the mission to demand change.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.831
And there are others
here who feel the same.

07:50.909 --> 07:52.102
What are
you suggesting?

07:52.180 --> 07:55.964
I'm just saying, Lukrum's declared
war, and I don't know if we can trust

07:56.042 --> 07:58.589
those in charge
to fight for us.

08:26.212 --> 08:27.882
I really
think this is the one.

08:27.983 --> 08:29.636
Well, I hope so.

08:29.714 --> 08:32.914
'Cause we ought to be knee-deep in
water and neck-deep in cash by now.

08:33.296 --> 08:35.691
There's still a lot we don't
know about this planet's make-up.

08:35.768 --> 08:37.940
Every time we poke,
it's a best guess.

08:38.368 --> 08:40.495
You try explaining
that to the suits back home.

08:40.679 --> 08:42.135
Whoa.

08:50.226 --> 08:51.831
What happened?

08:51.956 --> 08:54.065
Drill's bored
down to a layer of basalt.

08:54.143 --> 08:55.314
Not again.

08:55.392 --> 08:57.022
It's thicker
than the last one.

08:57.099 --> 08:58.910
It's going to take a lot
more power to penetrate.

08:58.987 --> 09:01.283
We're already pulling extra
juice from the camp's reserves,

09:01.360 --> 09:02.417
so how much do we need?

09:02.495 --> 09:06.120
Judging by the density of
this rock, everything we got.

09:06.198 --> 09:07.394
Alright, do it.

09:07.472 --> 09:09.534
Whatever it takes to keep
that drill bit spinning.

09:09.859 --> 09:12.393
We'll find extra power for
base camp somewhere else.

09:12.948 --> 09:15.288
Kurt's requested
around 400 kilowatts.

09:15.608 --> 09:17.537
It'll put a
strain on our grid.

09:17.675 --> 09:21.740
We'll have to make reductions in
operations output, ration elsewhere.

09:22.212 --> 09:25.811
- But it's doable.
- Yes.

09:26.623 --> 09:30.280
Though I'm surprised you agreed,
considering what Lukrum's up to.

09:30.749 --> 09:33.897
Between them saving Marta's life,
and us infecting half their camp,

09:33.990 --> 09:36.139
I couldn't exactly
say no, could I?

09:36.829 --> 09:38.147
I don't like it either.

09:38.225 --> 09:40.819
This Russia deal's
got IMSF panicking.

09:41.397 --> 09:44.321
But until they can figure it out on Earth,
there's nothing we can do about it here.

09:44.398 --> 09:46.076
The crew is
pretty worried about it.

09:46.154 --> 09:47.921
It might be good for them to
hear from their commander.

09:47.998 --> 09:49.647
Where do you
think I'm headed?

09:49.725 --> 09:51.749
<i>After the news of
Russia's mineral rights deal with Lukrum</i>

09:51.826 --> 09:54.274
<i>Industries, stock markets across
the world reacted positively.</i>

09:54.352 --> 09:55.592
Could you
turn that off, please?

09:57.228 --> 09:59.658
Can I have
everyone's attention?

10:00.796 --> 10:03.037
I know you're all concerned
about the Lukrum Russia

10:03.115 --> 10:04.811
agreement and how it
might affect us.

10:05.006 --> 10:06.537
I don't have all the answers.

10:06.912 --> 10:10.826
What I do know is that our
presence here is important.

10:11.084 --> 10:13.998
And even if this new deal requires
some adjustments on our part,

10:14.115 --> 10:16.709
the work we do
here is still vital.

10:17.074 --> 10:18.881
What kind
of adjustments?

10:22.168 --> 10:23.623
Budgetary.

10:24.420 --> 10:28.983
If Russia pulls out of IMSF, we may
see scale-backs across the board.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.147
More so in
low-priority departments.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.279
Mine.

10:33.413 --> 10:35.920
Nobody's work
is being abandoned.

10:36.412 --> 10:38.514
Our mission remains the same.

10:38.853 --> 10:41.037
I can't speak for deals
being struck on Earth.

10:41.209 --> 10:43.564
But their colony is helping
ours produce solar mirrors,

10:43.650 --> 10:45.577
and they
appear to be working.

10:45.701 --> 10:49.139
This morning,
we captured a satellite image

10:49.217 --> 10:52.241
of what could be a water
trace on the floor

10:52.319 --> 10:53.897
of Candor Chasma.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.920
This could be the
liquid proof that

10:56.998 --> 11:00.272
our terraforming efforts are
making a difference here.

11:00.478 --> 11:03.277
Senior engineer Foucault and I
are driving out to investigate,

11:03.397 --> 11:07.053
and in my absence, Lieutenant
Glenn will be in charge.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.162
Wish us luck.

11:18.938 --> 11:20.248
Traitors.

11:21.476 --> 11:25.240
I say we banish them, remove
them from the board completely.

11:25.438 --> 11:29.334
Russia will be dealt with, but exiling
members will only hurt our ability to

11:29.412 --> 11:30.708
combat Lukrum.

11:30.819 --> 11:34.217
Not to mention, creating
significant setbacks financially.

11:34.378 --> 11:35.438
I agree.

11:35.508 --> 11:37.584
Funding is an
immediate concern.

11:37.687 --> 11:40.780
However, this alliance
poses a far greater threat.

11:41.022 --> 11:43.569
It not only jeopardizes
IMSF cohesion,

11:43.647 --> 11:45.960
it opens the door to claiming
ownership of Mars.

11:46.038 --> 11:49.168
The door we opened by partnering
with them in the first place.

11:49.238 --> 11:52.287
True, yes, but we
are now looking at something

11:52.365 --> 11:55.608
well beyond our shared
goals for the planet.

11:55.694 --> 11:59.928
They're profiting by selling
something that isn't theirs to sell.

12:00.006 --> 12:01.405
Of course
I'm with you, Leslie.

12:01.483 --> 12:05.108
But there is no policy prohibiting
the extraction of materials.

12:05.408 --> 12:07.256
Without a ratified amendment.

12:07.334 --> 12:08.740
There is
no time for that.

12:08.818 --> 12:13.092
Right now, our only course of action is
to force the termination of this deal by

12:13.170 --> 12:14.698
applying as much
pressure as we can.

12:14.858 --> 12:16.959
We must sanction Lukrum.

12:27.920 --> 12:33.584
One of the problems that we might face
on mars with indusry is that money

12:33.670 --> 12:38.373
becomes the ruling factor,
that the sake of the investors

12:38.451 --> 12:41.138
becomes more important
than humanity.

12:41.208 --> 12:45.280
And I think we see something like
this happening all the time on Earth.

12:45.578 --> 12:49.170
It's not the case
that all corporations are bad.

12:49.467 --> 12:55.099
But it makes me nervous when corporations
persuade governments to do bad things.

12:55.248 --> 12:58.506
For example, things that are in the
short-term interests of the corporation,

12:58.584 --> 13:00.631
but not in the long-term
interests of the world.

13:01.315 --> 13:05.991
And one could say that the oil companies
and coal companies are perhaps the most

13:06.069 --> 13:08.638
destructive corporations
in the world today.

13:09.105 --> 13:11.506
The people that created the fossil
fuel industry

13:11.592 --> 13:13.951
did not think they were
doing some evil thing.

13:14.878 --> 13:18.652
And at the time, they, they weren't, there
was no real awareness that fossil fuels

13:18.730 --> 13:21.108
would have a long-term
negative effect.

13:21.938 --> 13:27.436
But then the corporations continued to
exist, and then, just like any organism,

13:27.701 --> 13:30.592
they take actions to
defend their existence.

13:32.553 --> 13:35.662
Exxon Mobil, which has throughout
history been one of the largest,

13:35.740 --> 13:38.232
most powerful oil
companies in the world.

13:38.365 --> 13:44.943
Exxon Mobil's scientists are the ones that
first really came to determine that burning

13:45.021 --> 13:47.841
fossil fuels harms the climate,
and that will harm us.

13:47.974 --> 13:52.053
Exxon was doing absolutely
cutting-edge research into the reality

13:52.131 --> 13:54.459
of climate change,
dating back to the 1970s.

13:54.537 --> 13:56.779
So they knew
better than anyone.

13:56.938 --> 14:00.725
And then, when the world got serious
about responding to climate change,

14:00.803 --> 14:04.334
Exxon poured money into think-tanks
that denied climate change,

14:04.412 --> 14:06.193
that spread misinformation.

14:06.623 --> 14:12.576
Proponents of the global warming theory
say that higher levels of greenhouse gases,

14:12.693 --> 14:17.428
especially CO2, are causing
world temperatures to rise,

14:17.568 --> 14:20.381
and that burning fossil
fuels is the reason.

14:20.872 --> 14:24.428
But scientific evidence
remains inconclusive.

14:25.836 --> 14:28.545
On the one hand, their PR
team was denying climate science,

14:28.623 --> 14:30.368
on the other hand, they
were jacking up their

14:30.445 --> 14:32.116
rigs in places where sea
level was going to rise.

14:32.193 --> 14:35.900
So they had this kind of dual thing
going on with climate change,

14:35.978 --> 14:39.373
where they were, they were actually using
the data to protect their resources.

14:39.451 --> 14:41.568
But... in the public front,
they were funding

14:41.646 --> 14:43.584
all this denial, to
not get any sort of

14:43.662 --> 14:45.220
restriction on their business.

14:45.298 --> 14:49.990
Many scientists agree there's
ample time to consider policy options,

14:50.248 --> 14:54.279
so there's simply no reason
to take drastic action now.

14:54.570 --> 14:59.107
One of the reasons why oil companies
have been so powerful for so long is simply

14:59.190 --> 15:02.435
by the force of their size.

15:03.896 --> 15:05.904
They don't have
a natural limit.

15:05.982 --> 15:07.896
They need to push
and push and push.

15:08.012 --> 15:11.178
But it turns out that
people like having status,

15:11.357 --> 15:13.342
and they
like having choices.

15:13.569 --> 15:15.575
Uh, those combined
are called wealth.

15:16.078 --> 15:18.725
So on Mars, it strikes me
as more likely than

15:18.803 --> 15:20.452
not, some of today's
billionaires will come

15:20.529 --> 15:23.646
up with the idea, I think I'll just
get to be really, really rich.

15:34.379 --> 15:36.076
He's ready for you.

15:51.828 --> 15:54.768
Secretary General.
Come for a swim?

15:54.896 --> 15:57.045
I'm afraid
I have more pressing matters.

15:57.160 --> 16:00.435
Barring you from auctioning off
Mars being chief among them.

16:00.778 --> 16:03.451
That's a shame;
the water's nice.

16:03.598 --> 16:07.638
This deal with Russia,
it's low, even for Lukrum.

16:08.543 --> 16:11.342
You have no right to
undermine my agency like this.

16:11.468 --> 16:13.701
Such actions simply
won't be tolerated.

16:13.779 --> 16:17.467
My actions are purely within
the realm of the free market,

16:17.732 --> 16:19.490
and your little
space treaty, I believe.

16:19.568 --> 16:23.906
Remember that tomorrow, when IMSF
and its member nations levy sanctions

16:23.984 --> 16:26.178
on your corporation.

16:28.038 --> 16:29.451
It's a bold move.

16:29.768 --> 16:31.881
I didn't think
you had it in you.

16:32.370 --> 16:35.896
I wanted to give you the opportunity
to terminate the pact voluntarily,

16:35.974 --> 16:39.545
because IMSF being the most respected
space agency in the world,

16:39.625 --> 16:44.820
is prepared to permanently and quite
publicly sever our partnership with Lukrum.

16:44.898 --> 16:46.357
- Really?
- Really.

16:46.435 --> 16:49.646
There are plenty of other companies
more in line with our values.

16:49.808 --> 16:51.881
And none
with our technology.

16:52.208 --> 16:55.443
The truth is, IMSF
can't do Mars without us.

16:56.708 --> 16:59.959
I think you'll find that the
same is true for Lukrum Industries.

17:18.641 --> 17:20.871
I've never seen
the crew so tense before.

17:21.074 --> 17:23.709
A lot of
dissatisfaction going around.

17:23.896 --> 17:27.310
I guess it's to be expected after
being here so long without any results.

17:29.145 --> 17:32.068
At least I had one
friendly face in the crowd.

17:33.981 --> 17:36.911
Hey. I'm sorry about your plans.

17:37.342 --> 17:39.968
I know how much they meant to
you, and how proud you were.

17:40.222 --> 17:44.888
It's not about pride.
It's about purpose.

17:45.130 --> 17:48.724
When I was young, I would build
sand castles on the beach.

17:49.092 --> 17:53.412
Big, detailed.
I loved it.

17:53.943 --> 17:58.896
But my father would say, don't
waste time with sand, Robbie.

17:59.372 --> 18:01.623
Build it to last.

18:05.172 --> 18:07.068
That's why I came here.

18:08.602 --> 18:10.301
And that's why I'm leaving.

18:10.638 --> 18:11.990
What?

18:12.077 --> 18:15.693
I still believe in the
mission, but I'm a builder, Hana.

18:16.161 --> 18:19.842
I need to be somewhere where
I can fulfill my purpose.

18:22.179 --> 18:24.568
We both know that
place is Lukrum.

18:43.344 --> 18:44.826
Hey.

18:45.408 --> 18:46.707
Watch that
coolant flow, alright.

18:46.803 --> 18:48.451
I don't want you cooking
another heat exchange.

18:48.529 --> 18:49.590
No
Problem, we're on it.

18:49.668 --> 18:51.935
- How's it looking?
- We're making a dent.

18:52.013 --> 18:55.146
The extra amperage should give us enough
power to keep it going for a while.

18:55.230 --> 18:56.334
Alright.

18:56.412 --> 18:58.693
What's that saying,
drill baby drill?

19:02.308 --> 19:04.108
Operations update.

19:04.325 --> 19:06.825
What's the colony running
at under rationed power?

19:07.069 --> 19:09.399
Minus 10%
across the board.

19:09.548 --> 19:13.553
Had to reduce the greenhouse by
15 and resource recycling by 30.

19:14.388 --> 19:16.459
Pull up
the energy meters.

19:18.726 --> 19:21.266
They are approaching
the 400-killowatt limit, sir.

19:35.557 --> 19:38.326
And now
they've exceeded it.

19:38.654 --> 19:40.748
Comms, Hydro Room.

19:43.618 --> 19:44.740
Delgado.

19:44.818 --> 19:47.717
I need you to sever the energy
transfer to Lukrum Colony, please.

19:47.795 --> 19:50.326
Cut them off?
Are you sure?

19:50.404 --> 19:53.646
They've exceeded the agreed-upon
limit, and we've been more than generous.

19:53.808 --> 19:55.388
Did Hana
authorize this?

19:55.551 --> 19:57.700
Hana's not here, so
as the acting commander,

19:57.778 --> 20:01.365
I'm ordering you to end the transfer,
and I expect you to comply.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.357
You are the boss.

20:21.842 --> 20:23.631
Power drawing down.

20:23.799 --> 20:27.154
If they want our help again,
they'll need to play by our rules.

20:28.959 --> 20:32.263
Shut off complete.
Lukrum Colony disengaged.

20:57.227 --> 20:59.505
You sure we're
in the right place?

21:00.908 --> 21:04.631
Yup.
These are the coordinates.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.982
Looks like it's
just some basalt.

21:18.157 --> 21:21.935
Compressed CO2 must have caused
it to erupt onto the surface.

21:22.305 --> 21:27.482
There's no water here.
Just more sand and rock.

21:29.661 --> 21:31.998
Why is there never anything?

21:33.708 --> 21:35.474
Why is there never any proof?

21:35.581 --> 21:37.756
Hana.

21:40.123 --> 21:45.029
Why is there nothing we've done or been
through that makes any of this worth it?

21:46.240 --> 21:49.060
We have nothing
to show for it.

21:49.421 --> 21:53.865
Not water, not
Joon, not my crew.

21:54.974 --> 21:57.178
And now I'm losing you, too.

21:57.668 --> 21:59.428
I'm sorry.

22:04.119 --> 22:06.201
Let's just go.

22:12.329 --> 22:14.148
What are you
doing on your feet?

22:14.381 --> 22:16.631
You still have two
months to go, stop.

22:16.921 --> 22:18.791
Isn't your pregnancy
stressful enough?

22:18.898 --> 22:21.308
I'm fine.
I'm just large.

22:22.168 --> 22:23.943
What can I do for you?

22:24.105 --> 22:26.375
Well, you could
make my migraine go away.

22:26.453 --> 22:29.849
This Lukrum/Russia
deal is giving you a headache?

22:29.935 --> 22:31.717
Among other things.

22:32.271 --> 22:33.826
Our colony's tense.

22:34.398 --> 22:40.115
IMSF has practically shut down my lab,
which hasn't really been the same since...

22:42.208 --> 22:44.138
Hey, I know.

22:44.995 --> 22:48.415
I can't help but feel like
our mission is doomed to fail.

22:49.349 --> 22:51.623
And maybe I'm
partly to blame for it.

22:51.734 --> 22:53.674
No, it can't fail.

22:53.752 --> 22:56.152
We have a future here.

22:56.301 --> 22:58.631
And we have to believe that.

22:58.709 --> 22:59.920
Let's
hope you're right.

22:59.998 --> 23:02.737
Of course I'm right.
Doctors always are.

23:02.954 --> 23:04.138
For you.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.006
Thank you.
A glass of water,

23:06.084 --> 23:08.053
- doctor?
- Yeah, sure.

23:09.604 --> 23:11.881
I can't open this.

23:13.542 --> 23:15.045
What?

23:17.215 --> 23:19.521
I think I
just had a contraction.

23:27.748 --> 23:29.975
Jen, hey, how
are you holding up, kid?

23:30.053 --> 23:31.257
Actually, sir,
we have a problem.

23:31.334 --> 23:33.327
- What's wrong?
- Olympus Town pulled the cord on us,

23:33.404 --> 23:34.585
and I didn't catch it at first,

23:34.662 --> 23:36.554
but by the time I did,
it started going quickly,

23:36.631 --> 23:38.123
and now we're
running low on power.

23:38.201 --> 23:39.935
- How low?
- We're browning out.

23:40.013 --> 23:43.090
Okay, kill all non-essential
functions and switch to back-up power.

23:43.168 --> 23:45.280
Re-route what you can to keep
the O2 generators working.

23:45.357 --> 23:46.208
I already did.

23:46.301 --> 23:48.880
Our back-up

23:48.973 --> 23:51.771
- has been shut down.
- Jen, Jen.

23:53.005 --> 23:55.037
Kill the drills.
Kill them!

23:58.178 --> 24:00.318
That's the
second one in 10 minutes.

24:00.583 --> 24:02.779
No, no,
I-I can't go into labor.

24:02.857 --> 24:03.864
It's not time.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.857
We have to stop
the contractions.

24:05.935 --> 24:07.577
Under normal circumstances,
I'd agree with you.

24:07.654 --> 24:09.382
But this is a particularly complicated
pregnancy,

24:09.459 --> 24:10.873
and given
your level of atrophy,

24:10.951 --> 24:12.468
I'm worried that it's going
to cause problems later on.

24:12.528 --> 24:13.728
It's time to deliver.

24:13.798 --> 24:15.155
No, it's too
early for me to deliver.

24:15.232 --> 24:16.382
I'll go get
Javier, he should be here.

24:16.459 --> 24:19.232
Don't, because I'm not
having this child right now.

24:19.368 --> 24:21.896
Give me 0.25 tepitalin now.

24:22.528 --> 24:24.193
Now!

24:24.478 --> 24:27.888
Comms,
contact Commander Seung.

24:28.198 --> 24:30.798
<i>Contacting
Commander Seung denied.</i>

24:31.498 --> 24:33.037
Denied?

24:34.876 --> 24:38.006
Comms, locate Commander
Seung and Robert Foucault.

24:38.208 --> 24:39.881
<i>Subjects offline.</i>

24:40.048 --> 24:41.748
<i>Unable to locate.</i>

24:41.826 --> 24:44.175
<i>Request could
not be completed.</i>

24:49.307 --> 24:51.793
I'm two seconds away from running
through the screen and knocking you out.

24:51.871 --> 24:52.938
Listen to me.

24:53.008 --> 24:54.308
Me and Hana had an agreement.

24:54.378 --> 24:56.438
Which you abused,
in predictable fashion.

24:56.508 --> 24:57.652
Why am I
even talking to you?

24:57.730 --> 24:58.890
Where is your commander?

24:58.968 --> 25:00.628
You're looking at him.

25:00.783 --> 25:03.769
Block all further communication
with the miners as well.

25:05.549 --> 25:07.543
Do we have a problem?

25:09.414 --> 25:14.121
No, no problem.

25:26.539 --> 25:28.599
<i>Incoming
call from Lukrum Colony,</i>

25:28.677 --> 25:29.720
<i>Commander Hurrelle.</i>

25:29.798 --> 25:31.089
Kurt,
how can I help you?

25:31.234 --> 25:32.720
What the hell is
going on over there?

25:32.798 --> 25:33.822
What do you mean?

25:33.900 --> 25:37.095
I got a crew that's about to
suffocate because your lunatic number two

25:37.173 --> 25:38.852
decided to cut
power to my camp.

25:38.930 --> 25:40.100
I'll get it handled.

25:40.178 --> 25:41.346
I'm headed back to
Olympus Town now.

25:41.423 --> 25:43.553
You get back to
me as soon as you can.

25:44.206 --> 25:45.405
Signal
won't go through.

25:45.508 --> 25:47.102
We've been cut off.

25:48.844 --> 25:50.687
What the hell is he doing?

25:52.068 --> 25:54.281
He's taking control.

26:07.971 --> 26:09.008
Okay, listen up.

26:09.086 --> 26:12.265
I, I need you to divert all
power to the Med Bay, okay?

26:12.343 --> 26:16.179
That's water, heating, anything
that isn't oxygen, shut it off.

26:17.578 --> 26:19.108
What percentage are we on now?

26:19.178 --> 26:20.765
10% and dropping.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.736
Something is wrong.

26:49.415 --> 26:52.419
Blood pressure's 180 over 90,
you're experiencing hypertension.

26:52.715 --> 26:55.122
No, it's too
soon, she's only 30 weeks.

26:55.523 --> 26:56.828
We've slowed down the
contractions,

26:56.905 --> 26:58.623
but the fetus is at risk of
going into distress.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.271
We have to perform a
caesarian immediately.

27:00.348 --> 27:01.638
No, we don't
have the equipment.

27:01.698 --> 27:04.231
It's best for the child,
it's best for the baby.

27:04.309 --> 27:05.738
No, I'm not ready.

27:05.808 --> 27:07.755
Not for this,
not here.

27:07.833 --> 27:10.710
We have no way of knowing
what her life will be like,

27:10.788 --> 27:12.076
and I don't
want that for my baby.

27:12.153 --> 27:14.048
I don't want that for my baby!

27:14.118 --> 27:16.628
This is every mother's
worries, no matter where they are.

27:16.698 --> 27:19.382
Everything's going to go
fine, I promise, okay.

27:19.476 --> 27:22.718
We have to do this, we
have to do this, yeah, okay?

27:22.796 --> 27:24.007
Breathe.

27:24.164 --> 27:25.938
You have to do this, yes?

27:26.008 --> 27:27.238
Okay.

27:27.308 --> 27:28.320
Okay.

27:28.408 --> 27:30.778
Let's prepare
an oxidation drip.

27:31.178 --> 27:34.468
Okay, I'm going to go
and get Javier for you, okay?

27:37.338 --> 27:40.210
<i>Warning,
remaining power at 3%.</i>

27:40.338 --> 27:42.406
Okay, everybody
get your suits on.

27:42.484 --> 27:43.695
We're losing
the system, Jen.

27:43.773 --> 27:44.907
It's not working. Okay, make sure

27:44.984 --> 27:46.992
all the oxygen
is going to the Med Bay.

27:47.070 --> 27:48.289
<i>Oxygen levels low.</i>

27:48.367 --> 27:50.312
<i>Redirecting oxygen to Med Bay.</i>

27:50.515 --> 27:52.601
Jen.
We're losing it.

28:15.592 --> 28:18.362
<i>Accessing power grid.</i>

28:20.239 --> 28:22.757
<i>Warning, reserves depleted.</i>

28:22.882 --> 28:24.882
<i>Oxygen system failure.</i>

28:25.027 --> 28:27.859
Okay, all crew
members to the Med Bay now.

28:28.073 --> 28:30.770
All crew members to
the Med Bay now, come on,

28:30.848 --> 28:33.608
come on guys,
to the Med Bay, come on.

28:33.785 --> 28:35.257
Quickly.

28:39.586 --> 28:43.079
Ah! Dios.

28:43.176 --> 28:46.423
<i>Incoming call
from Lukrum Colony, Commander Hurrelle.</i>

28:46.538 --> 28:47.668
How close are you?

28:47.738 --> 28:48.814
4 kilometers.

28:48.892 --> 28:50.900
I'm pushing our
battery pack as hard as I can.

28:51.032 --> 28:52.118
We're
almost to the flats.

28:52.196 --> 28:53.400
We're just 10
minutes away now.

28:53.478 --> 28:55.548
Yeah, my guys
don't have that long.

28:59.168 --> 29:00.638
- Come on.
- Okay, shut the doors.

29:00.708 --> 29:03.329
- Wait, what about Marvin?
- What, he's not here?

29:03.407 --> 29:04.642
No.

29:06.118 --> 29:08.946
Come on,
quickly, quickly.

29:11.668 --> 29:14.978
Marvin? Marvin.

29:15.394 --> 29:16.634
Can this
thing go any faster?

29:16.712 --> 29:18.842
I'm trying,
but if we top off.

29:19.208 --> 29:21.353
- Anything?
- No.

29:23.884 --> 29:24.940
Marvin!

29:25.018 --> 29:26.743
<i>Oxygen levels critical.</i>

29:26.821 --> 29:28.420
<i>System failure is imminent.</i>

29:28.498 --> 29:30.110
Marvin!

29:32.651 --> 29:35.275
Oh, Marvin.
Thank God.

29:36.660 --> 29:38.946
<i>1% oxygen remaining.</i>

29:39.490 --> 29:42.103
<i>Life support system
failure imminent.</i>

29:50.628 --> 29:56.650
<i>Warning, system
shutting down, system shutting down,</i>

29:58.376 --> 30:01.470
<i>system shutting down.</i>

30:12.437 --> 30:16.938
Almost there,
okay, okay.

30:46.260 --> 30:49.016
<i>Lukrum Colony is back online.</i>

30:49.105 --> 30:51.145
Oh boy, here.

30:51.352 --> 30:55.688
Hey, Jen? Jen, you got us?
Come in, Jen.

31:00.675 --> 31:04.321
We're here, commander.
We're okay. We're okay.

31:19.278 --> 31:22.852
- Sir?
- What is it?

31:23.422 --> 31:25.368
The miners are
receiving power again.

31:25.428 --> 31:27.376
Somebody must have
reinitiated the transfer.

31:27.454 --> 31:30.324
Javier.
Shut it down.

31:35.523 --> 31:36.528
I can't.

31:36.608 --> 31:37.704
What do you mean?

31:37.811 --> 31:39.471
Why not?

31:39.549 --> 31:41.529
Because I
overrode the system.

31:41.607 --> 31:44.507
I locked the mainframe so
nobody else can touch it.

31:44.897 --> 31:48.152
If you want to cut power to
Lukrum, you'll have to rig the

31:48.230 --> 31:49.863
wires out of the
ground yourself.

31:50.084 --> 31:52.972
I think it's in all of our best
interests for you to cut the connection.

31:53.050 --> 31:55.698
- Now.
- I take orders from my commander,

31:55.799 --> 31:58.558
which I will gladly do
once she returns to base.

31:58.636 --> 32:02.011
Javier. Javier!

32:03.362 --> 32:06.066
It's Amelie.
She's having the baby.

32:23.238 --> 32:29.097
Ladies and gentlemen of the board,
the time for discipline has arrived.

32:30.566 --> 32:35.068
What began as a temporary partnership based
around the mutual goal of colonizing

32:35.138 --> 32:42.059
Mars, has been soured by
opportunism and greed.

32:43.190 --> 32:47.560
A single corporation is making moves that
threaten the unity of this governing body.

32:48.282 --> 32:51.846
So together, we must
wrest control

32:52.008 --> 32:55.610
from those who would seek to
compromise our mission.

32:56.268 --> 33:00.932
Without order, it will be the end
of everything we have worked for.

33:02.378 --> 33:07.268
But by censuring Lukrum
and halting its extrajudicial actions,

33:07.439 --> 33:12.870
IMSF can maintain its vision of
science, exploration, and humanity.

33:15.758 --> 33:21.698
I believe that the future of life
on Mars greatly depends on it.

33:26.708 --> 33:33.550
For Mars to sustain human society,
we will need powerful people from all over

33:33.628 --> 33:38.120
the world, coming together
to rein in the companies.

33:38.467 --> 33:41.690
You will have countries who
don't always agree with each other,

33:41.807 --> 33:44.385
working together
for a bigger cause.

33:44.667 --> 33:48.323
It's part of that question of, can
we get along, can we be sustainable,

33:48.401 --> 33:50.862
how does that reflect
back to how societies

33:50.993 --> 33:53.542
work together back
here on this planet.

33:53.620 --> 33:56.175
What the Arctic nations
are facing right now

33:56.253 --> 33:58.503
with climate change
is a good analogy to

33:58.581 --> 34:01.383
how we're going to have to
learn how to deal with Mars.

34:01.631 --> 34:04.271
This pristine area

34:04.349 --> 34:07.565
that's being transformed, tof course,
by climate change in a big way,

34:07.643 --> 34:14.143
has some of the most exciting
undiscovered massive reserves in the world,

34:14.252 --> 34:17.260
suddenly changed the nature
of the global energy market.

34:17.620 --> 34:20.268
But there's no
government there.

34:20.438 --> 34:24.078
So a bunch of existing governments
have to find ways to work together,

34:24.208 --> 34:27.201
despite the fact that
it's a free-for-all.

34:27.389 --> 34:29.639
And the Arctic Council
serves that purpose.

34:31.467 --> 34:35.217
<i>The annual meeting of
the Arctic Council is underway in Alaska.</i>

34:35.302 --> 34:39.833
<i>Ministers from eight different nations that
border the Arctic are discussing</i>

34:39.911 --> 34:42.708
<i>economic development, oil
drilling, and climate change.</i>

34:42.777 --> 34:45.826
<i>The Arctic Council takes
a keen interest in climate change and some</i>

34:45.920 --> 34:48.264
<i>members have been
worried about a possible</i>

34:48.342 --> 34:50.083
<i>U.S. withdrawal from
the Paris Agreement.</i>

34:50.161 --> 34:53.474
<i>Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson got an earful when he met with</i>

34:53.552 --> 34:56.420
<i>members of the Arctic Council
in Fairbanks, Alaska yesterday.</i>

34:56.628 --> 35:00.959
The Paris Climate Agreement is the
cornerstone for mitigating climate change,

35:01.044 --> 35:03.568
and we should act
with determination.

35:03.646 --> 35:05.865
If our shared values
are put at risk,

35:06.013 --> 35:09.060
the policies need to change,
not the values.

35:09.208 --> 35:13.779
If we want a sustainable
future, we need a stable Arctic.

35:14.008 --> 35:20.248
The tragedy of our moment is that
that deadline to act in the climate battle

35:20.326 --> 35:24.607
hits us at the triumph of a very
extreme form of capitalism.

35:24.708 --> 35:27.568
Represented, one might
say, by the Trump presidency.

35:28.010 --> 35:32.060
We have five former Goldman Sachs
executives in Donald Trump's cabinet.

35:32.185 --> 35:35.295
We have the former CEO of Exxon
was the secretary of state.

35:35.560 --> 35:40.334
And their worldview is really
at war with life on Earth.

35:40.412 --> 35:42.943
<i>- What do we want?
- Climate justice.</i>

35:43.021 --> 35:44.615
<i>- When do we want it?
- Now.</i>

35:44.732 --> 35:48.732
<i>Outside the meetings,
protests were largely directed at the US,</i>

35:48.810 --> 35:51.810
<i>which has chaired the Arctic
Council for the past two years.</i>

35:52.035 --> 35:57.357
We have known for decades
that oil harms public health,

35:57.581 --> 36:01.114
causes wars,
destroys the climate.

36:01.378 --> 36:05.967
And yet governments and companies
certainly don't intend to change.

36:06.045 --> 36:09.271
This is how they have made their
money, this is what they do,

36:09.381 --> 36:11.911
and this is what they
intend to continue to do.

36:11.989 --> 36:13.982
Because it is what
gives them power.

36:14.068 --> 36:18.381
In the United States, we are currently
reviewing several important policies,

36:18.615 --> 36:23.177
including how the Trump Administration
will approach the issue of climate change.

36:23.748 --> 36:28.162
We're going to work to make the right
decision for the United States.

36:28.266 --> 36:33.240
The United States will withdraw
from the Paris Climate Accord.

36:33.333 --> 36:35.917
<i>A little-known provision
within the Republican tax bill</i>

36:36.028 --> 36:38.675
<i>would open the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge.</i>

36:38.753 --> 36:40.456
<i>Trump has signed
an executive order</i>

36:40.534 --> 36:41.988
<i>aimed at reducing restrictions</i>

36:42.066 --> 36:43.714
<i>on oil drilling in the Arctic.</i>

36:43.792 --> 36:46.198
They're basically saying
climate change doesn't matter.

36:46.854 --> 36:50.860
And as, as a result, what we do
in the Arctic doesn't matter.

36:50.938 --> 36:55.831
We need aggressive
climate policy. We must do more.

36:55.908 --> 36:59.003
For many people, there
is a desperation,

36:59.081 --> 37:00.776
that if the government isn't going

37:00.854 --> 37:04.440
to do it, and society isn't going
to do it, I'm going to do it.

37:04.622 --> 37:08.258
And that's the empowerment
that comes with

37:08.422 --> 37:11.862
being someone who's
taking an action,

37:11.940 --> 37:14.456
and doing something about it.

37:17.128 --> 37:19.938
Adrian, Matt, follow me.

37:24.338 --> 37:26.480
There's got to be
a way to override this.

37:27.679 --> 37:30.119
Stand down, Mike.

37:30.746 --> 37:33.096
No, Hana.
It's time you stand down.

37:33.190 --> 37:34.823
Lukrum's taken more than
they agreed to,

37:34.901 --> 37:36.862
not just today, but since
they arrived here.

37:37.042 --> 37:39.245
They've taken advantage of us
at every turn,

37:39.323 --> 37:40.941
- and you've let it happen.
- That's enough.

37:41.018 --> 37:43.449
You've been incapable of leading
this mission since your sister's death,

37:43.526 --> 37:45.604
and I won't sit by and
watch it all fall apart.

37:45.682 --> 37:47.290
So you thought
you'd take over, is that it?

37:47.367 --> 37:50.471
Because while you're making your move,
Lukrum was on the verge of collapse.

37:50.549 --> 37:51.549
Oh, that's
a load of crap.

37:51.627 --> 37:54.073
That power was supplying
the entire camp,

37:54.167 --> 37:56.315
and cutting them off
compromised their grid.

37:56.831 --> 37:59.854
We nearly lost their
colony and everyone in it.

38:00.002 --> 38:02.588
I... I didn't know.

38:02.784 --> 38:04.721
It wasn't
your job to know.

38:05.078 --> 38:08.549
Your job was to follow orders, and
because you didn't, people almost died.

38:08.627 --> 38:11.057
Look, if I'd
been made aware.

38:11.135 --> 38:12.901
Confine him
to his quarters.

38:22.244 --> 38:26.154
<i>Put hands off me.
Put hands off me.</i>

38:36.362 --> 38:40.229
Control's been restored
and we are back to normal.

38:40.370 --> 38:41.464
You guys good?

38:41.542 --> 38:44.812
We're operational.
Almost at capacity.

38:45.920 --> 38:49.460
Appreciate you letting us replenish our
reserves till we're fully up and running.

38:49.543 --> 38:51.242
Don't mention it.

38:51.384 --> 38:57.011
I must say, I prefer seeing you in
that chair, over that lieutenant of yours.

38:57.268 --> 38:59.034
Anyway, thanks.

38:59.112 --> 39:01.072
You're welcome.

39:09.245 --> 39:10.623
I'm scared.

39:10.701 --> 39:14.722
Hey, no, no,
it's going to be okay, I promise.

39:16.812 --> 39:18.712
We have to do this now.

39:33.827 --> 39:39.440
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:40.198 --> 39:43.237
Didn't really get a
chance to finish talking earlier.

39:46.819 --> 39:52.558
What's left to say?
I assume you're still leaving.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.683
I am.

39:56.311 --> 40:03.745
Which means that I no longer work here,
which means you're no longer my commander.

40:05.453 --> 40:07.522
You know how I feel, Hana.

40:07.757 --> 40:09.757
You always have.

40:10.006 --> 40:12.606
And I believe
you feel the same.

40:17.027 --> 40:25.027
Maybe me going means there's
finally a chance for this.

40:26.476 --> 40:28.198
For us.

40:46.247 --> 40:52.269
There is no us, Robert.
There's just a mission.

40:55.605 --> 41:02.573
And I don't know why you could be a part of
something that flies in the face of that.

41:06.087 --> 41:08.503
But I won't stop you.

41:15.377 --> 41:17.245
Goodbye, Hana.

41:26.675 --> 41:30.604
Secretary General.
It's time.

41:40.487 --> 41:46.378
With six votes yes and four
votes no, Mr. Kim of South Korea,

41:46.589 --> 41:50.269
do you support sanctions
against Lukrum Industries?

41:52.187 --> 41:53.597
Yes.

41:56.024 --> 42:02.604
With seven votes yes and four
votes no, Ms. Wilson of Australia,

42:03.433 --> 42:07.401
do you support sanctions
against Lukrum Industries?

42:08.390 --> 42:09.737
No.

42:09.826 --> 42:16.331
With seven votes yes and five votes
no, Mr. Davis of the European Union,

42:16.448 --> 42:19.901
do you support sanctions
against Lukrum Industries?

42:20.039 --> 42:21.394
No.

42:21.666 --> 42:25.069
- With seven votes yes and six votes no...
- I had agreements with both of them.

42:25.147 --> 42:26.604
People are
scared, Leslie.

42:26.706 --> 42:29.269
Lukrum has a presence in
every corner of the world.

42:29.347 --> 42:31.144
What are you saying?

42:31.449 --> 42:33.190
No.

42:33.389 --> 42:34.886
I can't
believe this is happening.

42:34.964 --> 42:39.737
You have to understand, they are a
huge economic force, and a political one.

42:40.017 --> 42:43.698
To move against them would be
disastrous for many communities.

42:43.957 --> 42:46.756
If we don't stop them,
they'll control Mars too.

42:46.834 --> 42:53.206
Mr. Valkov of Russia, do you support
sanctions against Lukrum Industries?

42:53.347 --> 42:56.565
No. I do not.

42:57.187 --> 43:04.448
You're right, Lukrum should
be stopped, but they can't be.

43:04.727 --> 43:11.769
Mrs. Chandra of India, do you support
sanctions against Lukrum Industries?

43:14.526 --> 43:15.878
No.

43:18.417 --> 43:23.987
By a majority, the resolution to
impose sanctions against Lukrum Industries

43:24.292 --> 43:25.807
has not passed.

43:26.647 --> 43:28.769
The session is adjourned.

43:30.038 --> 43:33.675
I'm sorry,
Lukrum is just too powerful.

43:45.190 --> 43:50.988
Whenever the wealth and the size and
the influence of companies is greater than

43:51.066 --> 43:53.371
the government,
you see over and over and

43:53.449 --> 43:55.401
over again, that the
decisions of the

43:55.479 --> 43:57.569
government follow the
will of the companies.

43:57.647 --> 44:03.082
The power and wealth of the pharmaceutical
industry and their 1,300 lobbyists,

44:03.187 --> 44:08.579
and unlimited sums of money, have
bought the United States Congress.

44:08.657 --> 44:10.817
- Mr. Danes, no, Mr. Maran... <i>
- Because of the earlier</i>

44:10.894 --> 44:12.785
Citizens United Supreme Court decision,

44:12.863 --> 44:17.457
<i>big corporations have almost no real limits
on how much they can spend to influence</i>

44:17.535 --> 44:18.582
<i>political issues.</i>

44:18.677 --> 44:21.547
<i>The lobbying power
of corporate America expanded greatly</i>

44:21.617 --> 44:23.487
<i>since the 1970s.</i>

44:23.566 --> 44:26.675
<i>It is everywhere, in
administrative agencies and elections and</i>

44:26.753 --> 44:28.894
<i>lobbying,
influencing our courts.</i>

44:28.988 --> 44:32.879
The merger of the corporate and
political worlds has accelerated,

44:32.957 --> 44:36.019
or maybe you could just say
the mask has been taken off.

44:36.972 --> 44:39.753
Any notion of there being
something called the public good,

44:39.832 --> 44:43.675
other than whatever is most profitable
for a corporation, is gone.

44:43.787 --> 44:48.074
The ayes have it at
46, the nays are at 52.

44:48.207 --> 44:50.574
The amendment is
not agreed to.

44:52.267 --> 44:59.175
For me, the overarching goal of
humankind is to learn how to value

44:59.261 --> 45:04.503
water, air, the things we need
to live, more than money.

45:04.647 --> 45:08.972
We need to be thinking in much longer
timescales than a balance sheet.

45:10.547 --> 45:14.472
Here we are, at this
amazing branch point,

45:14.558 --> 45:17.332
where our science
and technology have

45:17.410 --> 45:19.449
taken the greatest of leaps.

45:19.637 --> 45:24.100
And yet, I can't help but be
haunted by the fact that

45:24.178 --> 45:30.441
we are still very deeply mired in
our technological adolescence.

45:30.557 --> 45:37.980
We don't think about what our short-term
actions are doing to our long-term future,

45:38.058 --> 45:40.577
and that of our
children and grandchildren.

45:40.647 --> 45:47.342
And so I'm not really ready to say that we
should unleash ourselves on another world.

45:50.727 --> 45:53.137
Blood pressure
is rising, 190 over 100.

45:53.207 --> 45:55.162
Incising the fascia.

45:55.277 --> 45:56.553
Tractor?

45:57.177 --> 45:58.707
Hey,
you're doing great.

45:58.794 --> 45:59.795
<i>Incising
the uterus now.</i>

45:59.873 --> 46:00.933
<i>Clamp.</i>

46:01.011 --> 46:02.295
It's okay.
Just breathe.

46:04.247 --> 46:05.306
Pick ups.

46:05.384 --> 46:07.239
You're gonna feel a
little more pressure now.

46:07.317 --> 46:09.654
Reaching in.
Here we go.

46:13.647 --> 46:14.998
They are
taking care of her.

46:15.076 --> 46:16.416
Check the hands.

46:16.776 --> 46:18.639
Let's get some
suction right away.

46:18.837 --> 46:21.678
What's happening?
Is she okay?

46:21.806 --> 46:27.545
Scissors. Massaging.
Towels please, hurry.

46:27.907 --> 46:29.490
Why isn't she crying?

46:29.669 --> 46:31.444
Hey, it's
okay, just breathe.

46:31.522 --> 46:35.076
What's happening?
What's wrong with her?

46:35.959 --> 46:37.347
We don't know yet.

46:37.417 --> 46:40.060
Is she breathing?
Where are you taking her?

46:40.138 --> 46:41.334
It's okay,
just breathe.

46:41.412 --> 46:43.280
- I want to see her.
-  They are taking care of her.

46:43.357 --> 46:47.115
What's going on?
What's wrong with my baby?

46:47.448 --> 46:50.458
<i>What's happening?
What's wrong?</i>
