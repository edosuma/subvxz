WEBVTT

00:25.275 --> 00:27.194
Dance your cares away

00:27.277 --> 00:29.363
Worry's for another day

00:29.446 --> 00:31.448
Let the music play

00:31.532 --> 00:33.367
Down at Fraggle Rock

00:33.450 --> 00:35.661
Work your cares away

00:35.744 --> 00:37.704
Dancing's for another day

00:37.788 --> 00:39.331
Let the Fraggles play

00:39.414 --> 00:40.374
-We're Gobo.
-Mokey.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.291
-Wembley.
-Boober.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.376
Red.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.172
Junior!

00:47.256 --> 00:48.590
Hello!

00:50.175 --> 00:51.301
My radish.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.388
Dance your cares away

00:54.471 --> 00:56.515
Worry's for another day

00:56.598 --> 00:58.600
Let the music play

00:58.684 --> 01:02.604
Down at Fraggle Rock
Down at Fraggle Rock

01:02.688 --> 01:04.105
Down at Fraggle Rock.

01:08.277 --> 01:12.030
Sprocket, I gotta figure out
how to do my big project without lab space

01:12.114 --> 01:13.782
since my school's not giving me any.

01:13.866 --> 01:17.995
Here I am worrying about how
I'm gonna grow dozens of bacteria samples

01:18.078 --> 01:21.623
while my classmates are out
livin' it up on a three-day weekend.

01:21.707 --> 01:24.042
It's not fair. I need a brain break.

01:25.627 --> 01:27.921
Cool surfboard, Marshall.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.049
There it is.

01:32.885 --> 01:35.554
Just let me feel sorry for myself
for a second.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.265
What has gotten into you, Sprockie?

01:39.183 --> 01:41.977
What is it? You know what?

01:42.060 --> 01:45.022
That is a good idea, Sprockie.
We could go on vacation right here.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.107
It'll just take some imagination.

01:47.191 --> 01:49.484
But, unlike money,
we've got plenty of that.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.069
Thanks, Sprockie. I needed that.

01:57.743 --> 02:01.663
Well, I tell ya. It was a close call
getting my Uncle Matt's package today.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.708
But it looks to be
a pretty special dispatch.

02:04.791 --> 02:08.628
Yeah, he's going on about
something called a "vacation."

02:11.215 --> 02:12.716
"Cave-ation."

02:12.799 --> 02:14.468
No, no, no. Vibration.

02:14.551 --> 02:17.721
-Well…
-"Waka-talka-tation"?

02:19.139 --> 02:21.391
What's a vacation?

02:21.475 --> 02:23.727
-Well, Red, a vaca--
-Yeah.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.395
-You see, it's…
-Yeah?

02:25.479 --> 02:26.563
Let's find out.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.066
"Dear Nephew Gobo,

02:29.149 --> 02:32.736
Exploring can be draining,
and I was looking for a way to relax."

02:32.819 --> 02:35.030
That's when I discovered
something called…

02:35.113 --> 02:36.198
A vacation.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.992
It's where all the Silly Creatures
go to relax.

02:39.076 --> 02:42.204
They love it.
Why else would they come here every day?

02:42.287 --> 02:43.288
Hello!

02:43.372 --> 02:44.998
Hi.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.543
If it's relaxing water features
you're looking for,

02:47.626 --> 02:48.877
they've got you covered.

02:48.961 --> 02:50.671
All yours. The water's great.

02:53.382 --> 02:55.926
They even had a light massage cavern.

02:56.009 --> 02:59.388
I could feel the stress melting away
from my bendy parts.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.474
Five more minutes, please.

03:08.939 --> 03:12.693
After a long day of relaxing,
I had developed quite a thirst.

03:16.446 --> 03:17.906
I developed quite a thirst.

03:27.291 --> 03:28.292
What?

03:28.375 --> 03:32.212
"I've sent you a memento
from my vacation: mega cup."

03:32.838 --> 03:34.298
Wow.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.758
"Big enough to quench
an adventurer's thirst.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.594
Love, your Uncle Travelling Matt.

03:38.677 --> 03:41.471
PS: Everyone deserves a vacation.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.224
PPS: I lost my mustache comb.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.101
If you find it, keep it safe."

03:46.185 --> 03:48.687
Wow. So that's what a vacation is.

03:48.770 --> 03:49.771
Yeah!

03:49.855 --> 03:54.818
Relaxation, water.
Sounds like what we do all the time.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.111
Yeah, Wembley.

03:56.195 --> 04:00.282
But this is about doing those things
in a different place.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.993
-Yep.
-I want to go on a vacation.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.161
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.998
Well, vacation's gonna have to wait.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.250
We've got our whole week's work
ahead of us.

04:10.334 --> 04:13.045
-Yeah, let's go, everyone. Come on.
-All right.

04:13.128 --> 04:16.964
-We'll see you there, Wembley.
-Okay. Just gotta put on my fire hat.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.634
Hello, dear friend.

04:21.470 --> 04:22.971
Hey, Cotterpin.

04:23.055 --> 04:27.768
Is this the sticky goo we found coming up
out of those vines a while back?

04:27.851 --> 04:32.523
When can we start building with it?
Today? Tomorrow? Today?

04:32.606 --> 04:35.275
Whoa, slow down there, Turbo.

04:35.359 --> 04:37.236
We need to do more tests.

04:37.319 --> 04:40.781
What if it doesn't hold
or tastes bad to the Fraggles?

04:41.281 --> 04:42.449
Not to mention--

04:42.533 --> 04:45.953
Bop, bop, bop!
Come on, you're worried about nothing.

04:46.036 --> 04:49.081
You deserve recognition
for this discovery.

04:49.164 --> 04:50.499
Yeah!

04:50.582 --> 04:56.213
It's not about praise.
It's about teamwork and sticking together.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.466
Yeah, this goo helps us stick together.

04:59.550 --> 05:02.886
We know that's not what you meant.
We messed up.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.389
We're goofballs!

05:13.230 --> 05:14.439
Workweek over!

05:14.940 --> 05:16.900
Thank goodness.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.611
I thought that workweek
would never be over.

05:19.695 --> 05:20.696
Oh, yeah.

05:21.697 --> 05:24.032
To be fair, it was only 30 minutes.

05:24.116 --> 05:26.785
An exhausting 30 minutes.

05:26.869 --> 05:29.413
I had to blow
my lifeguard whistle and yell

05:29.496 --> 05:33.166
"Keep having fun"
to all the Fraggles in the pond.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.835
I'm beat.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.171
Well, I feel rejuvenated.

05:37.254 --> 05:41.967
Picking radishes out of the Gorgs' garden,
connecting to the bounty of the harvest.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.343
Oh, I love my work.

05:43.427 --> 05:46.805
Me too. Cleaning my Uncle Matt's
museum is an honor.

05:46.889 --> 05:49.516
And, boy, did I clean it.
It was already clean,

05:49.600 --> 05:52.186
and then I cleaned it some more.
And I cleaned it again.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.479
-It's really clean, bud. Yeah.
-Cool!

05:54.563 --> 05:58.400
Well, I got to sound the alarm and help
the bucket brigade put out a fire.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.237
It wasn't a fire. It was my soup.

06:02.321 --> 06:03.780
A cold soup.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.700
-Sorry.
-Unbelievable.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.745
-Well, let's put the workweek behind us.
-Yeah.

06:09.828 --> 06:13.832
Because it's time to go
on a much-deserved vacation!

06:13.916 --> 06:15.626
All right!

06:15.709 --> 06:21.173
Hold on to your baloobiuses
because I know exactly where we should go!

06:21.965 --> 06:23.133
Tell us in song.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.219
I thought you'd never ask!

06:33.769 --> 06:37.022
I know that it's been a long week

06:37.105 --> 06:39.441
A vacation's just what we need

06:39.525 --> 06:41.818
We deserve a little time away

06:41.902 --> 06:43.695
Time away

06:43.779 --> 06:46.198
There'll be water as far as you see

06:46.281 --> 06:48.992
And if splashing around is your dream

06:49.076 --> 06:51.495
I guarantee I found the perfect place

06:51.578 --> 06:53.247
Perfect place

06:53.330 --> 06:57.167
Where all your troubles melt away
Worries seem like they're miles away

06:57.251 --> 06:59.503
-So far
-You'll forget about yesterday

06:59.586 --> 07:01.505
The second you escape

07:01.588 --> 07:03.173
-To Craggle Lagoon
-Yeah!

07:03.257 --> 07:05.592
Where the rocks are hot
And the water's deep

07:05.676 --> 07:08.011
-Take me to Craggle Lagoon
-Yeah!

07:08.095 --> 07:10.639
Where every day
There's a perfect breeze

07:10.722 --> 07:12.808
-Take me to Craggle Lagoon
-Yeah!

07:12.891 --> 07:16.937
-You can swim all day
-Splash around and then catch a wave

07:17.020 --> 07:20.399
-You could never get there too soon
-Yeah!

07:20.482 --> 07:22.818
-Take me to Craggle Lagoon
-Yeah!

07:22.901 --> 07:25.028
Dive right into the blue beneath

07:25.112 --> 07:27.281
-Take me to Craggle Lagoon
-Yeah!

07:27.364 --> 07:29.825
You can feel the rhythm
You feel the beat

07:29.908 --> 07:31.994
-Take me to Craggle Lagoon
-Yeah!

07:32.077 --> 07:33.370
You can swim all day

07:33.453 --> 07:36.373
-So much fun that you'll want to stay
-Wow!

07:36.456 --> 07:38.959
You could never get there too soon

07:39.793 --> 07:41.503
Yes, it's true

07:42.087 --> 07:44.006
In fact, you might want to move

07:44.882 --> 07:47.176
-To Craggle Lagoon
-Yeah!

07:49.553 --> 07:51.680
Yeah, guys! Let's go!

07:52.639 --> 07:54.766
Craggle Lagoon, here we come!

07:55.434 --> 08:00.689
Junior Junior, where are you?

08:02.232 --> 08:04.359
Just kidding. I know where you are.

08:04.443 --> 08:07.404
So, Ma and Pa went on vacation.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.282
They're kissing at Kiss Canyon.

08:12.409 --> 08:17.122
And I thought I'd spend the day with you.
Would you like that?

08:17.706 --> 08:19.124
"I'd like that very much."

08:19.208 --> 08:20.876
Okay, great!

08:20.959 --> 08:24.838
I'm gonna move you to a better spot.

08:24.922 --> 08:27.299
After all, you're a Gorg,

08:27.382 --> 08:30.177
and Gorgs deserve the best.

08:32.554 --> 08:33.722
There it is!

08:34.972 --> 08:38.101
Wow, our first vacation.

08:38.184 --> 08:43.941
A whole big lagoon
as far as the eye can see.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.902
Lagoons usually have water
in them, right?

08:46.985 --> 08:49.071
Yeah, where is the water?

08:49.154 --> 08:51.990
Why is the lagoon dried up?

08:52.074 --> 08:53.367
It's a mystery.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.745
Yes! A mystery.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.830
A mystery for…

08:59.331 --> 09:01.959
Inspector Red!

09:02.042 --> 09:05.504
The Rock's greatest detective.

09:05.587 --> 09:08.257
And the only Fraggle
with access to a magnifying glass.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.883
-Yeah.
-That's true.

09:09.967 --> 09:15.973
It's the case of: Who Stole Our Vacation?

09:18.600 --> 09:20.227
Mango smoothies.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.149
This is the life.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.902
Hey, Sprocket, how about we jet-set a bit?

09:32.948 --> 09:34.408
Cucumber roll?

09:36.743 --> 09:38.954
You know, I love the city,

09:39.037 --> 09:42.291
but how about we get
out of this hustle and bustle?

09:49.006 --> 09:52.009
-Yeehaw!
-Okay, okay, okay. That's enough.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.261
Blueberries, fresh from nature.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.555
Well, fresh from nature,

09:57.431 --> 09:59.266
and then frozen, and then shipped,

09:59.349 --> 10:00.726
and then I bought 'em.

10:01.852 --> 10:06.857
When I saw the footprints,
I knew I found my first clue.

10:06.940 --> 10:12.863
Whoever they belong to stole the water
and, more importantly, my vacation.

10:12.946 --> 10:16.783
Red, we can hear what you're saying.
And those are our footprints.

10:18.911 --> 10:20.996
I was met with some resistance.

10:21.705 --> 10:25.834
You know,
this place has a really relaxing aura.

10:25.918 --> 10:28.295
Maybe we should just enjoy what's here.

10:28.378 --> 10:31.465
Yeah, and I look cool in these floaties.

10:32.633 --> 10:36.011
I refused to rest until I found the water.

10:36.678 --> 10:40.224
I refuse to rest until I find the water.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.226
Oh, well, there's no water in that dirt.

10:43.644 --> 10:44.853
A suspect!

10:44.937 --> 10:48.232
Hi. Name's Lyle.
What brings you to Craggle Lagoon?

10:48.315 --> 10:51.443
Hey, buddy.
I'm asking the questions around here.

10:51.527 --> 10:53.487
Now, who are you?

10:53.570 --> 10:55.155
I'm Lyle. I just said that.

10:56.073 --> 10:58.408
I'm a Craggle. And this is our lagoon.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.285
At least it was until it all dried up.

11:01.912 --> 11:03.747
We're the Craggles. We live here.

11:03.830 --> 11:04.998
More suspects!

11:05.832 --> 11:07.501
Red, they're not suspects.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.711
They've been robbed of their water.

11:10.420 --> 11:11.755
-Fraggle huddle.
-Yeah.

11:11.839 --> 11:15.717
I couldn't believe Gobo was calling
a Fraggle huddle in the middle of--

11:15.801 --> 11:19.304
-Red, just get over here.
-Oh, okay.

11:19.972 --> 11:21.890
-We gotta help these Craggles.
-Yeah.

11:21.974 --> 11:26.270
We could do a bucket brigade,
like firefighters when there's a fire?

11:26.353 --> 11:29.356
Or like when an innocent Fraggle
is preparing cold soup?

11:29.439 --> 11:32.109
-Sorry again about that, Boober.
-Wembley's right.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.570
We should bring them some water.
We have plenty.

11:34.653 --> 11:35.696
-Yeah.
-Good idea.

11:35.779 --> 11:38.323
And I'll help by staying here
and solving the case.

11:38.407 --> 11:41.785
That way we can get back to our vacation!

11:41.869 --> 11:45.539
And the Craggles can have the water
they need for life and all that stuff.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.499
-Yeah.
-Break.

11:47.583 --> 11:50.460
Don't worry, Craggles,
we'll be back, with water.

11:50.544 --> 11:51.837
Yeah.

11:52.588 --> 11:57.050
All right, Lyle, my investigation
is going to start with you.

11:59.511 --> 12:00.721
Okay.

12:00.804 --> 12:03.182
I sensed he was worried.

12:03.265 --> 12:05.559
Oh, no, no. I'm happy to help.

12:08.854 --> 12:10.981
The sunniest spot in the garden.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.859
Nothing but the best for us Gorgs.

12:13.942 --> 12:14.943
Yeah.

12:15.027 --> 12:16.570
Hey, you.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.364
With the face and the head and whatnot.

12:19.448 --> 12:20.657
Me?

12:20.741 --> 12:23.577
Why'd you move
Tall-y McGrows-a-lot over here?

12:24.494 --> 12:27.122
Yeah. He's blocking our view.

12:27.206 --> 12:29.583
What, do you think you're better than us?

12:30.250 --> 12:33.337
B-B-But Gorgs deserve the best.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.256
-Well, it's a good example you're setting.
-Yeah.

12:36.340 --> 12:39.218
I guess we'll just wither
in his shadow, eh?

12:39.301 --> 12:40.469
No, no!

12:40.552 --> 12:42.679
Here I go. I'm withering!

12:42.763 --> 12:45.265
Oh, what do I do? What do I do?

12:48.727 --> 12:50.521
Fraggles! Fraggles!

12:50.604 --> 12:52.773
The Craggles are
in desperate need of water!

12:52.856 --> 12:55.025
We need a bucket brigade
to Craggle Lagoon!

12:55.817 --> 12:56.818
Yeah.

12:56.902 --> 13:00.197
Murmurs of concern.
This is how change happens.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.615
Let's do it!

13:03.534 --> 13:08.163
Oh, wow. It's nice to see that siren
can be used for good sometimes.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.541
Sorry. I'm sorry!

13:11.166 --> 13:13.585
-It was a cold soup!
-I'm sorry!

13:13.669 --> 13:14.670
Oh, wow.

13:14.753 --> 13:17.840
This mega cup from Uncle Matt's gonna be
perfect to help the Craggles.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.260
They're spilling the water!

13:21.885 --> 13:24.972
No way they're getting
any water to the Craggles.

13:25.055 --> 13:27.975
Hey, could you two watch the goo
while I help them?

13:28.058 --> 13:29.768
We are on it.

13:29.852 --> 13:33.313
I will make sure the goo stays
right where it belongs.

13:33.397 --> 13:37.776
Thanks. I can't just sit back
and watch these Fraggles flail.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.028
-See you later, friend!
-Bye!

13:40.112 --> 13:41.530
-Hey, Wrench?
-Yeah?

13:41.613 --> 13:44.867
I think this goo belongs in headquarters.

13:44.950 --> 13:47.786
It's gonna be
a game changer for construction,

13:47.870 --> 13:49.913
and Cotterpin deserves the credit!

13:49.997 --> 13:53.458
I don't know.
It gives me a funny feeling in my tummy.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.210
-No, that's good.
-It is?

13:55.294 --> 13:59.214
You can't say "good idea" without "goo,"
right?

13:59.798 --> 14:02.676
You are right! Let's do this!

14:02.759 --> 14:06.096
-Okay, here we go. No, use my back!
-No, use your front!

14:06.972 --> 14:08.640
Tell me again,

14:08.724 --> 14:12.186
where were you when the water disappeared,

14:12.269 --> 14:15.814
and my vacation along with it?

14:15.898 --> 14:18.358
Well, we can't talk about that here.

14:18.442 --> 14:21.069
You need to talk to the town leader.

14:22.946 --> 14:25.699
-Aha, yes!
-Let's go.

14:34.708 --> 14:35.709
It's me.

14:37.753 --> 14:39.129
Pretty cool, right?

14:39.213 --> 14:40.714
Well, yeah, yeah.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.716
Inspector Red knew that.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.638
You don't want to wake the Mantivore.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.808
What's a Mantivore?

14:51.892 --> 14:58.065
Well, it's a big, scary creature
that lives in a huge spout by the lagoon.

14:58.148 --> 15:02.778
But we can't go talk to it
because it might eat us.

15:03.362 --> 15:05.197
Or worse…

15:05.781 --> 15:06.782
yell at us.

15:09.535 --> 15:12.496
Maybe the Mantivore took the water!

15:13.664 --> 15:17.292
-Well, I don't care how scary he is.
-Yeah.

15:17.376 --> 15:19.503
It's not fair what he did to me.

15:20.546 --> 15:22.673
-And you.
-Yeah, okay.

15:22.756 --> 15:25.133
-So awful what happened to your water.
-Yeah.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.678
Well, fear not.

15:27.761 --> 15:30.973
Inspector Red is on the case.

15:39.773 --> 15:43.068
I'll get information and speculation
For the exploration

15:43.151 --> 15:44.278
It's true

15:44.361 --> 15:48.156
And the expectations of the operation
Are very high

15:48.240 --> 15:52.661
But the motivation of the perpetration
Is a botheration right through

15:52.744 --> 15:56.373
And the preparation of the accusation
Leaves me high and dry

15:56.999 --> 15:59.042
But I'm on the case
And I'm in the chase

15:59.126 --> 16:02.337
And I won't go back
'Cause I'm on the track to know

16:02.421 --> 16:03.463
To know

16:03.547 --> 16:05.340
-To know
-To know

16:05.424 --> 16:07.718
And the facts come in
Till your senses spin

16:07.801 --> 16:10.846
But your mind is clear
And you're searching here to know

16:10.929 --> 16:12.139
-To know
-To know

16:12.222 --> 16:13.515
To know

16:13.599 --> 16:15.309
There's a lot I want to know

16:18.854 --> 16:21.148
Now the aggravation
Of the investigation

16:21.231 --> 16:23.066
Is the imputation of guilt

16:23.150 --> 16:25.485
And the implication is a prevarication

16:25.569 --> 16:26.987
When they talk to me

16:27.571 --> 16:31.825
But your reputation for concentration
And inspiration is built

16:31.909 --> 16:33.911
On dedication to imagination

16:33.994 --> 16:35.370
To a high degree

16:36.205 --> 16:38.373
But I'm on the case
And I'm in the chase

16:38.457 --> 16:41.502
And I won't go back
'Cause I'm on the track to know

16:41.585 --> 16:42.586
To know

16:42.669 --> 16:44.505
-To know
-To know

16:44.588 --> 16:46.882
-And the facts come in
-Till your senses spin

16:46.965 --> 16:49.885
-But my mind is clear
-And you're searching here to know

16:49.968 --> 16:51.136
-To know
-To know

16:51.220 --> 16:52.596
To know

16:52.679 --> 16:54.389
There's a lot I want to know

16:55.390 --> 16:56.975
There's a lot I want to know

16:57.559 --> 17:00.103
-There's a lot you gotta figure out
-Yeah

17:00.896 --> 17:03.899
Oh, boy. There he is.

17:04.566 --> 17:06.902
That's the Mantivore.

17:07.653 --> 17:08.654
Aha!

17:08.737 --> 17:12.907
It appeared I had found my suspect,
the Mantivore.

17:12.991 --> 17:16.369
He just looked big
because of my magnifying glass.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.839
Okay, wow. You're actually big.

17:27.422 --> 17:30.259
You!

17:38.934 --> 17:42.604
If I want to give my tree the best spot,
then I'll do it.

17:42.688 --> 17:46.942
I am a Gorg. And I do what I want.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.948
Then why do I feel so lousy?

17:54.283 --> 17:56.368
No, no, no.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.203
Sorry, Junior Junior.

17:58.787 --> 18:03.500
I want the best for you,
but I can't hurt the other plants.

18:04.334 --> 18:08.172
It might not be perfect,
but it'll still be great.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.464
Sound good?

18:10.549 --> 18:11.550
Sure.

18:11.633 --> 18:16.180
Sure. As long as you keep
Leafy McBlooms-a-lot out of our way!

18:16.263 --> 18:17.264
Capoosh?

18:17.347 --> 18:19.016
Okay, capoosh.

18:19.558 --> 18:21.727
You still seem pretty angry.

18:21.810 --> 18:24.479
He did the right thing.
Give him some credit.

18:25.147 --> 18:28.025
Honestly,
it's not even completely about him.

18:28.108 --> 18:31.278
-I just-- I haven't been sleeping well.
-Uh-oh.

18:31.361 --> 18:34.198
You…

18:34.281 --> 18:36.867
are both welcome in my home.

18:36.950 --> 18:39.328
-What?
-Wai-- Wait.

18:39.411 --> 18:43.248
-You're welcoming us?
-Why'd you say it in such a scary way?

18:43.332 --> 18:46.376
You know…

18:46.460 --> 18:48.837
I never really thought
about it that way.

18:48.921 --> 18:50.339
It's just the way I talk.

18:51.632 --> 18:55.010
Do you think that's why
the Craggles are scared of me?

18:55.636 --> 18:58.222
I mean, it doesn't really help.

18:58.847 --> 19:02.976
Oh, all right.
Enough small talk and big scary talk.

19:03.060 --> 19:06.730
-Why did you take the water, Mantivore?
-Yeah.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.316
Oh, please, call me Manty.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.777
And I didn't take the water.

19:12.694 --> 19:14.238
Then who did?

19:14.321 --> 19:15.656
It was…

19:15.739 --> 19:17.741
you!

19:20.035 --> 19:22.120
I feel like I'm missing something.

19:22.204 --> 19:24.331
That's-- That's my hair tie.

19:24.414 --> 19:27.584
But how did it get all the way over here?

19:27.668 --> 19:30.671
The last time I lost a hair tie was…

19:31.547 --> 19:32.840
I got you, Gobo!

19:32.923 --> 19:36.552
We were looking for
Gobo's uncle's backpack and got trapped.

19:40.138 --> 19:43.642
We moved a boulder,
and then all this water came pouring out.

19:43.725 --> 19:46.395
-Is that…
-Water!

19:47.729 --> 19:49.940
We got blasted into these water slides,

19:50.023 --> 19:53.777
and it created a beautiful new waterfall
in our Great Hall.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.699
-Wow!
-Wow!

19:58.782 --> 20:01.285
Look at all of this new water!

20:01.368 --> 20:07.457
Yes, but did you ever think about
where all that water came from?

20:08.709 --> 20:13.380
They're going to blame
this on you, Manty.

20:14.256 --> 20:19.178
So, moving the boulder rerouted the water

20:19.261 --> 20:21.346
and made the lagoon dry up?

20:22.723 --> 20:27.477
I can't believe the suspect
I was looking for this whole time was…

20:28.187 --> 20:29.188
You.

20:30.522 --> 20:32.524
Wow, you said that so quietly.

20:32.608 --> 20:34.776
Well, I thought it fit the moment better.

20:41.366 --> 20:45.329
Wow, we really didn't have to go anywhere
to have a great time, huh?

20:45.412 --> 20:49.917
Other people might get fancy vacations,
but we're actually pretty lucky, Sprocket.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.794
I mean, look what we made work right here.

20:54.963 --> 20:56.340
Wait a minute.

20:57.007 --> 20:58.509
Right here.

20:58.592 --> 21:01.595
What's stopping me
from setting up a lab right here?

21:01.678 --> 21:05.807
I'll have to pull some extra power,
use some makeshift equipment.

21:06.558 --> 21:09.478
But who ever changed the world
by doing it the normal way?

21:10.687 --> 21:14.274
Sprocket, we are going to solve
the ocean's plastic problem.

21:14.358 --> 21:17.069
And we're gonna do it right here at home.

21:18.278 --> 21:19.279
Oh, don't worry.

21:19.363 --> 21:20.906
We can finish our camping trip first.

21:21.907 --> 21:23.200
You're sloshing it.

21:23.283 --> 21:25.202
-Got it? Hold it steady.
-I got it, Gobo. Okay.

21:26.203 --> 21:27.454
No sloshing.

21:27.538 --> 21:30.040
-I'll pour. I'll pour.
-I'm trying.

21:30.123 --> 21:33.252
You can't both pour.
Someone has to hold the bucket.

21:33.335 --> 21:34.795
-I'm trying.
-Yeah, I--

21:34.878 --> 21:36.964
They're sloshing. They're sloshing.

21:37.047 --> 21:39.341
Water flows. Flow with it.

21:39.424 --> 21:41.301
Well, how do you do that?

21:41.385 --> 21:46.974
Okay, everybody,
Inspector Red has solved the case.

21:47.057 --> 21:48.976
-All right.
-You did?

21:49.893 --> 21:51.270
What case?

21:52.020 --> 21:55.065
I thought we deserved a dumb vacation,

21:55.148 --> 22:00.821
when this whole time the Craggles
didn't have any water because of us.

22:00.904 --> 22:02.865
What? Well, what did we do?

22:02.948 --> 22:05.784
I'll explain everything later,
but for now,

22:05.868 --> 22:08.287
the Craggles are going to stay
here with us

22:08.370 --> 22:13.125
and have as much of our water
as they need while we figure things out.

22:14.251 --> 22:18.046
Thank goodness, 'cause our
bucket brigade is not going so well.

22:18.130 --> 22:19.381
Yeah, you were sloshing.

22:19.464 --> 22:21.717
-Okay, really?
-Great idea, Red.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.510
Yeah, Red. Wow.

22:23.594 --> 22:25.637
That's really thoughtful of you.

22:27.222 --> 22:30.350
I'm not liking
how surprised you sound by that.

22:32.561 --> 22:36.106
That's right. Bring that goo here.

22:37.524 --> 22:39.860
Dump it in and we'll mix it
with the Doozer sticks.

22:39.943 --> 22:43.822
All right, I'm back.
Time to work on my goo experiments.

22:43.906 --> 22:44.907
-Hooray!
-Yay!

22:44.990 --> 22:46.158
Yeah. All right.

22:46.241 --> 22:50.037
Cotterpin, congratulations
on discovering this sticky goo.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.873
Why, we've already put it into production.

22:52.956 --> 22:54.458
Goo.

22:54.541 --> 22:57.628
But I wasn't finished testing it.

22:57.711 --> 22:59.588
Oh, Cotterpin!

23:02.716 --> 23:06.261
We thought you deserved
some recognition for your work.

23:06.345 --> 23:08.013
-Yeah. That's right.
-Yeah.

23:08.096 --> 23:10.933
-So congrats. Congrats. Yeah.
-Congrats. Yeah.

23:11.016 --> 23:13.560
Great Doozer on a Snoozer!

23:19.107 --> 23:21.026
Well, I gotta hand it to you, Red.

23:21.109 --> 23:23.278
You did something great for the Craggles.

23:24.530 --> 23:27.950
I really took it for granted
how good we have it here.

23:29.326 --> 23:32.162
Maybe it's time
the Craggles got a vacation.

23:32.246 --> 23:33.705
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

23:33.789 --> 23:36.375
So, where do you see them staying?

23:36.458 --> 23:38.460
And what are we gonna do
about their water?

23:38.544 --> 23:40.420
Hey, who's gonna do their laundry?

23:41.004 --> 23:42.005
Don't worry.

23:42.089 --> 23:46.176
Red would've never brought the Craggles
here without thinking all that through.

23:46.260 --> 23:47.845
-Right, Red?
-Of course. Of course.

23:49.513 --> 23:51.265
What the gang did not know

23:51.348 --> 23:55.602
was that Inspector Red had not
thought any of that through.

23:58.146 --> 24:00.732
Again, we can hear you.

24:00.816 --> 24:01.817
Oh.
