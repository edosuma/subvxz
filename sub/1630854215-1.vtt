The Good Doctor...

00:12.780 --> 00:14.282
Shaun Robert Murphy,

00:14.415 --> 00:15.716
do you take
Lea Abigail Dilallo--

00:15.849 --> 00:17.451
I do.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.420
To Shaun and Lea!

00:19.553 --> 00:21.355
<i>How'd the interview go?</i>

00:21.489 --> 00:22.656
I want the job.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.792
I understand.

00:24.925 --> 00:26.827
Your father's
prognosis was wrong.

00:26.960 --> 00:27.895
He only has
a few weeks to live.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.330
I love you, son.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.265
Goodbye, Dad.

00:32.166 --> 00:34.102
- Dalisay?
- My...

00:36.670 --> 00:37.471
Aah!

00:51.919 --> 00:52.953
Shaun.

00:53.921 --> 00:55.489
Look at me. Hey.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.158
Look at me!

00:58.759 --> 01:00.261
Shaun, it's okay. I'm here.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.229
Look at me.

01:08.969 --> 01:11.139
I feel... married.

01:11.272 --> 01:12.206
Do you feel married?

01:13.441 --> 01:15.409
What does married feel like?

01:18.812 --> 01:19.513
I don't know.

01:20.448 --> 01:21.815
Different?

01:21.949 --> 01:22.716
Amazing?

01:23.984 --> 01:25.519
More to-have-and-to-hold-y?

01:27.421 --> 01:29.357
I feel like...

01:29.490 --> 01:32.025
I love you more
than I have ever loved anybody.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.527
And I'm very happy.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.497
So, the same as before.

01:40.033 --> 01:40.701
Me, too.

Ooh.

02:36.457 --> 02:37.791
Dalisay?

02:52.139 --> 02:53.474
- <i>Hey.</i>
- I'm hurt.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.577
- I'm stabbed.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

02:56.710 --> 02:57.978
I can't hear you.
You're breaking up.

02:58.111 --> 02:59.313
In the break room.

02:59.447 --> 03:00.281
Ah!

03:01.081 --> 03:02.082
Lim?

03:05.118 --> 03:05.786
Lim?

03:17.164 --> 03:19.633
<i>Your call has been

03:21.769 --> 03:22.636
You're bleeding.

What?

03:26.073 --> 03:26.707
Your neck.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.346
I was putting a psych patient
in physical restraints.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.515
It got rough.
Thanks for the heads up.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.021
Where's your badge?

03:43.357 --> 03:44.858
Must've fallen off
when he grabbed me.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.330

04:51.992 --> 04:53.894
Get him
to trauma bay two.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.162
I recognized the guy
who attacked him.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.531
He's Villanueva's ex-boyfriend.

04:57.665 --> 04:58.766
She's not answering her phone.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.300
He got on
on the fifth floor, right?

05:00.434 --> 05:01.669
Yeah.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.537
That's where Lim
was heading to, the break room.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.339
We gotta get trauma bags.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.240
The shooter is still loose.
We're supposed to st--

05:08.942 --> 05:09.777
I'm coming with you.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.581
Last time,

05:13.714 --> 05:14.848
it was just a guy
with a box cutter.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.450
No one was hurt.

05:20.454 --> 05:21.922
Hey. Where are you?

05:22.055 --> 05:23.223
<i>I'm out front.
Are you okay?</i>

05:24.392 --> 05:24.992
You bailed on me?

05:27.027 --> 05:28.462
I wasn't in the best mood.

05:28.596 --> 05:29.663
You said you understood.

05:30.731 --> 05:31.965
Doesn't mean
I'm happy about it.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.735
Oh, my God.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.336
Jerome says
there's an active shooter.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.339
Lim and Villanueva
might be hurt.

05:41.575 --> 05:42.342
I gotta go.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.982
Dr. Glassman says Dr. Lim and
Nurse Villanueva may be hurt.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.318
- On the fifth floor.
- Lim went to the break room.

05:51.452 --> 05:52.686
I told her we needed glasses.

05:52.820 --> 05:56.123
Okay. Okay.
I need to get down there.

05:56.256 --> 05:57.791
Shaun, you can't.
We just have to stay here.

05:59.827 --> 06:00.894
Shaun, you cannot
go down there.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.530
Dr. Lim may need my help.

06:02.663 --> 06:03.464
Then I'm going, too.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.298
No. You're not a doctor.

06:05.433 --> 06:06.767
They don't need you.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.001
I will see you soon.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.874
I'm a doctor, too.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.443
Well, I'm not
staying here alone.

06:17.678 --> 06:21.715
Hello? Is anyone here?
I'm really sick.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.116
I don't know.
Could be the shooter.

06:24.351 --> 06:25.385
Or a sick guy,

06:25.519 --> 06:26.954
seeing as we're in a hospital.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.022
Hello?

06:36.530 --> 06:37.397
Shh, shh.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.166
I was waiting in the ER.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.368
I tried to make my way
to the pharmacy for antacids.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.103
I'm Dr. Reznick.
This is Dr. Wolke.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.672
Ezra.

06:44.805 --> 06:45.506
How bad is your stomach pain?

06:45.639 --> 06:46.874
I have Crohn's disease.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.742
The last time this happened,
I needed surgery.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.012
We should get out
of the hallway.

06:52.145 --> 06:52.913
It's not safe.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.415
Ready? One, two, three.

06:55.549 --> 06:56.917
Thank you.

07:03.557 --> 07:04.525
Oh, my God.

07:10.931 --> 07:14.101
Lea, look in the cabinets
for scalpels, sutures,
gauze, syringes, needles.

07:16.504 --> 07:19.439
Large neck wound,
anterior triangle, maybe more,

07:19.573 --> 07:22.610
defensive wrist lac with
possible radial artery injury.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.545
At least two deep thoracoabdominal
penetrating wounds.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.046
She's lost a lot of blood.

07:26.179 --> 07:26.880
Use this.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.552
Weak and thready carotid pulse.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.023
Tourniquet's on forearm.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.591
- I found the gauze.
- Muffled heart sounds.

07:37.725 --> 07:39.560
She has a cardiac tamponade.

07:39.693 --> 07:40.694
Did you find needles?

07:40.828 --> 07:42.095
Yeah. Yeah. And the syringes.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.798
Put firm pressure on Dr. Lim's
wounds with the gauze.

07:44.932 --> 07:45.899
Add more when
they're saturated.

07:49.436 --> 07:50.704
Two stretchers, now.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.606
Backboards, blood, and saline,
if you can find them.

07:59.346 --> 08:00.213
Mm.

08:03.350 --> 08:04.217
I'll get the door.

08:05.385 --> 08:06.486
What now?

08:06.620 --> 08:07.988
We stay quiet and we wait

08:08.121 --> 08:09.089
for them to lift the lockdown.

08:18.065 --> 08:19.299
Distant heart sounds.

08:19.432 --> 08:20.701
- Is she dying?
- Yes.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.336
Her blood's being choked off
by blood buildup.

08:24.705 --> 08:26.940
Okay. Palpating
the xiphoid process.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.108
Point to the left shoulder.

08:32.279 --> 08:32.946
I'm in.

08:41.989 --> 08:43.691
Jugular distention

08:43.824 --> 08:45.392
and tachycardia improving.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.521
Dr. Andrews.

09:14.655 --> 09:15.723
Who's on the floor?

09:15.856 --> 09:17.257
Me and a couple anesthesiologists.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.026
That's it?

09:19.159 --> 09:20.060
How we doing
on blood and supplies?

09:20.193 --> 09:21.561
Low on all.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.997
We had three transplants
and two GSWs today.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.000
You're on one with Lim.

09:27.134 --> 09:29.002
Jerome, you're with
Villanueva in two.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.204
Cop's on the line.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.706
This is Dr. Andrews.

09:32.840 --> 09:33.774
This is Captain Holland.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.075
We're taking
operational control.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.143
<i>Understood.</i>

09:36.276 --> 09:37.344
Already diverted
incoming ambulances.

09:37.477 --> 09:38.612
<i>Copy that.</i>

09:38.746 --> 09:40.547
Is there--
Is there anything I can do?

09:40.681 --> 09:41.715
You can be

09:41.849 --> 09:43.083
our circulating nurse.

09:44.718 --> 09:47.688
I, I meant more like
get people coffee, but, um...

09:47.821 --> 09:49.189
Okay, yeah, what do I do?

09:49.322 --> 09:50.824
Find the supplies we ask for

09:50.958 --> 09:53.526
and hand them
to the surgical field,
like you did just now.

09:53.661 --> 09:54.527
Okay.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.143
Shaun,
start with the abdomen.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.091
Sternum saw.

11:14.241 --> 11:15.175
Cooley retractor.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.555
Lacerations
to the pulmonary hilum.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.159
Left ventricle is nicked.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.128
That's what caused
the tamponade.

11:36.663 --> 11:38.866
It's not very wide, though.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.034
Pledgeted
prolene sutures, please.

11:41.168 --> 11:43.670
She has
a grade four liver laceration

11:43.804 --> 11:45.873
with active bleeding
into the peritoneum.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.275
Lea, d-do you know
what a lap sponge is?

11:48.408 --> 11:51.478
It's like a hand towel
with two blue handles.

11:51.611 --> 11:53.546
How many do you need?
As many as you can find.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.048
There's a third drawer
down there.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.721
Safest bet is to remove
the damaged lobe.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.557
That's half her liver.

12:05.926 --> 12:08.528
We can do an
angio-embolization instead.

12:08.661 --> 12:11.231
If that goes south, she'd need
a major transfusion.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.000
That can't happen.
We're in a lockdown.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.235
A hemi-hepatectomy
would decrease

12:15.368 --> 12:17.237
her life expectancy
by ten years.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.505
Life expectancy, Shaun?

12:18.638 --> 12:19.907
She has 20 minutes, maybe,

12:20.040 --> 12:21.074
unless we can stop
his hemorrhage.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.210
You are being shortsighted.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.345
I'm very shortsighted.
I want to keep her alive.

12:25.478 --> 12:26.914
Dr. Glassman?

12:27.047 --> 12:29.349
Dr. Andrews needs your help
with Villanueva.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.084
Ventricle is sewn up.

12:31.218 --> 12:34.487
Shaun, you are going to
cut out the damaged lobe,
do you understand?

12:36.489 --> 12:37.190
Yes.

12:37.757 --> 12:38.758
Okay.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.900
Full thickness
tracheal laceration
with sub-q emphysema

12:47.034 --> 12:49.169
and a nick in her jugular
below the facial branch.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.838
And the left carotid
is shredded.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.339
We're gonna have to
patch that up first.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.307
I'm thinking closed stent.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.543
If we have to anti-coagulate
her, she'll bleed out.

12:56.676 --> 12:59.913
We got to stop the flow,
tie off the artery upstream.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.248
She's unconscious.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.050
There's no way to test
the collateral circulation

13:03.183 --> 13:04.852
to see if there's enough
to perfuse her brain.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.553
She's young.
I'm willing to take that bet.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.355
You're willing to risk
a massive stroke?

13:08.488 --> 13:10.490
As opposed to letting
her bleed to death? Yeah.

13:14.661 --> 13:15.695
Vascular clamp and a silk tie.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.630
Oh!

13:23.170 --> 13:24.804
No, no, please, please. Ow!

13:24.938 --> 13:26.073
Tender with guarding
and rigidity.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.241
His bowel's perforated.

13:29.877 --> 13:32.145
Okay, well...

13:32.279 --> 13:34.281
I'll look for supplies in case
we need to operate in here.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.616
Just lock the door behind me.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.100
Dr. Murphy?

13:53.233 --> 13:56.369
The bleeding is confined
to an aberrant vessel.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.806
We do not need
to take half her liver.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.675
We can do the
angio-embolization safely.

14:02.809 --> 14:05.212
But you told Dr. Glassman
you were gonna do
the hemi-hepatectomy.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.679
Parameters have changed.

14:06.813 --> 14:09.516
The angio-embolization
is the proper choice.

14:09.649 --> 14:10.984
Should someone
let Dr. Glassman know?

14:11.118 --> 14:12.552
Inform him if you like.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.654
I need to proceed to avoid
further hemorrhaging.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.189
Argon beam coagulator.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.078
Morgan?

14:40.347 --> 14:41.314
Stay where you are.

14:43.816 --> 14:45.152
Don't move.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.333
- What's going on?
- Shh!

15:05.572 --> 15:06.573
What's the tray for?

15:10.043 --> 15:11.544
Where were you going?

15:11.678 --> 15:12.912
I'm sorry. I just...

15:16.383 --> 15:17.750
There's a kid in there
with a perforated bowel.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.553
If we don't do surgery,
he's going to die.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.473
Shaun, did you change
the surgical plan?

16:13.606 --> 16:16.109
The parameters
it was based on changed.

16:16.243 --> 16:18.145
I adjusted accordingly.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.313
And ignored my instructions

16:20.447 --> 16:21.814
in favor of what
you wanted to do?

16:22.549 --> 16:23.316
Yes.

16:25.718 --> 16:29.256
Why didn't you ask me?
Why didn't anybody ask me?

16:29.389 --> 16:30.790
It seemed like
a reasonable call.

16:30.923 --> 16:31.991
That's not your call to make.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.426
Nor is it yours.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.329
How far into this are we?

16:36.463 --> 16:38.398
I located the site
of contrast extravasation

16:38.531 --> 16:40.367
and the catheter
is in position.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.535
Well,
that's just great.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.504
We're locked in. Gimme a coil.

16:46.939 --> 16:50.009
There was a skyway,
bridge-type thing.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.811
I went there for a smoke once.

16:51.944 --> 16:54.347
Not that far off the ground.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.549
What are you gonna do?
Jump? It would kill you.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.186
- Where is it?
- I-I-It's two floors down.

16:59.319 --> 17:00.987
All the stairs and elevators
are locked off.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.855
There's really--
There's no way out of here.

17:04.324 --> 17:05.325
No!

17:06.293 --> 17:07.760
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

17:08.761 --> 17:11.664
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

17:13.300 --> 17:16.169
Open the door!
Open up! I have a gun.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.037
I'm gonna shoot
this doctor in the head
if you don't open the door!

17:18.171 --> 17:19.339
Morgan, don't!

17:28.315 --> 17:29.549
I have three hostages!

17:29.682 --> 17:31.484
You stay back
or I start shooting!

17:34.254 --> 17:36.689
One area
of extravasation remaining.

17:37.790 --> 17:38.858
Deploying my coil.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.699
Heart rate 168.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.067
Big drop in BP.

17:48.201 --> 17:50.002
Coils are fine.
Where's the bleeding?

17:51.838 --> 17:53.640
Large collateral vessel
must be damaged.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.875
We can inject
gel foam particles

17:56.008 --> 17:57.844
for distal embolization.

17:59.045 --> 18:00.680
BP's critical.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.049
- I'm gonna pivot back.
- I'm almost there.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.751
We're going to
resect the liver.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.253
Don't touch her.
I am injecting contrast--

18:06.386 --> 18:08.321
I am removing
the packing, Shaun.

18:08.455 --> 18:11.224
No. I see
how to stop the bleed.
Injecting particles.

18:20.900 --> 18:24.537
Complete embolization
with no residual bleeding.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.308
BP's rising.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.049
Okay.

18:38.185 --> 18:38.918
Let's close her up.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.122
It was a reasonable call.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.127
Nice work with
the needle driver.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.562
Thanks.

19:02.041 --> 19:02.809
Jerome.

19:05.077 --> 19:07.146
There's a hostage standoff
on the fifth floor.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.281
Everyone's fine.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.384
But it's Dr. Reznick and Asher.

19:17.990 --> 19:18.591
I'm sorry.

19:23.029 --> 19:23.830
Let's finish this.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.480
You guys stay back or you
won't like what happens.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.017
How is she?

19:46.686 --> 19:48.688
- Who?
- Dalisay.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.626
Now you're concerned
for her well-being?

19:55.962 --> 19:56.663
I love her.

20:01.133 --> 20:01.968
Ezra?

20:02.101 --> 20:03.403
Ezra.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.137
He needs surgery or he'll die.

20:08.508 --> 20:09.642
Do it in here.

20:22.789 --> 20:23.790
Do you have a ten-blade?

20:24.524 --> 20:25.658
<i>No, just a fifteen.</i>

20:27.159 --> 20:29.796
Okay. How many GIA staplers?

20:29.929 --> 20:33.900
None, but we can
hand-sew or anastomosis.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.670
<i>As long as he doesn't have
a history of bowel surgery.</i>

20:40.139 --> 20:41.173
He does.

20:47.614 --> 20:48.681
I love you.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.523
If we open him up here,
we'll kill him.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.262
I spoke to the OR earlier.

21:03.396 --> 21:05.965
Your ex, Lim, that guard,

21:06.098 --> 21:08.635
they're all expected
to make full recoveries.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.704
So, right now,
all they have you on
is attempted murder.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.173
But if this kid dies...

21:17.577 --> 21:18.745
You-- You didn't
talk to the OR.

21:19.512 --> 21:20.480
I did.

21:31.424 --> 21:33.726
You, take him out of here.
You're staying with me.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.012
I have blood on my sleeve.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.415
You okay?

21:56.315 --> 21:58.418
It's not my blood.

21:59.452 --> 22:02.154
Okay. I just--

22:02.288 --> 22:04.391
I don't know.
I was concerned about you.

22:04.524 --> 22:05.958
You shouldn't be.

22:06.092 --> 22:08.761
I made the right call,
and Dr. Lim's recovering.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.164
Dr. Lim's waking up.

22:14.601 --> 22:15.768
I have to go.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.604
Oh. I'm here if you need me.

22:19.071 --> 22:20.440
Thank you. I don't.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.297
My dad beat up my mom.

22:48.435 --> 22:49.802
Put her in the hospital
a couple times.

22:51.471 --> 22:52.805
I hated his guts.

22:58.511 --> 23:01.681
Spent my childhood saying I'd--
I'd be different than him.

23:06.453 --> 23:07.520
My dad's dying.

23:12.492 --> 23:13.426
He has a couple weeks...

23:15.294 --> 23:15.828
at most.

23:19.198 --> 23:20.399
Cancer.

23:22.168 --> 23:23.836
I just put him on a plane
back to New York.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.541
What went wrong between us...

23:32.945 --> 23:34.080
will never get fixed.

23:38.485 --> 23:39.351
We're out of time.

23:45.324 --> 23:46.893
There's still time for you.

23:57.069 --> 23:58.370
It's okay.

24:09.015 --> 24:10.683
Yeah, she's recovering.

24:10.817 --> 24:13.486
She had trauma to her carotid,
trachea, and jugular,

24:13.620 --> 24:14.887
but we were able
to repair it all.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.258
You had
pulmonary hilum injuries,

24:19.992 --> 24:21.761
a nicked ventricle,

24:21.894 --> 24:23.195
a grade four liver laceration.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.398
It was a tough call,
but Dr. Murphy here

24:27.634 --> 24:30.302
opted for an angio-embolization

24:30.436 --> 24:32.404
and managed to preserve
your entire liver.

24:41.113 --> 24:41.914
You're welcome.

24:42.949 --> 24:45.251
A security guard was stabbed,

24:45.384 --> 24:47.119
but he's expected
to make a full recovery.

24:48.755 --> 24:50.557
Oh.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.091
- Abdominal pain?
- Oh!

24:52.224 --> 24:54.226
- Right upper quadrant?
- Mm.

24:54.360 --> 24:56.128
Higher?

24:57.463 --> 24:59.632
Her heart.

25:05.638 --> 25:06.939
Well, you'll serve
your sentence,

25:08.207 --> 25:09.108
make amends, and then--

25:10.810 --> 25:11.944
and then start again.

25:14.413 --> 25:15.648
There's only two ways
out of this.

25:16.783 --> 25:18.284
You either turn yourself in,

25:18.417 --> 25:19.518
or you die.

26:06.699 --> 26:07.700
Thank you.

26:11.704 --> 26:13.239
Is Dalisay really still alive?

26:17.076 --> 26:18.577
I have no idea.

26:45.705 --> 26:46.739
Drop the gun!

27:00.987 --> 27:02.421
There.

27:02.554 --> 27:05.658
A traumatic VSD
in the inferior portion
of the septum.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.459
The cut went deeper
than we thought.

27:07.593 --> 27:10.062
The defect can be repaired
with a GORE-TEX patch.

27:11.698 --> 27:12.965
I need help.

27:18.604 --> 27:21.607
SWAT got him.
Multiple GSWs
to the arm and chest.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.642
Was in PEA,
but we got him back.
BP 60 over palp.

27:23.776 --> 27:24.977
Dr. Glassman!

27:25.111 --> 27:27.079
Ash. You okay?

27:29.581 --> 27:32.284
OR two, set up for bypass with
whatever O-Neg we have left.

27:32.418 --> 27:34.921
Aaron, you handle this
with Dr. Wolke.

27:35.054 --> 27:36.923
- Shaun, we'll fix Lim's heart.
- Okay.

27:37.056 --> 27:40.426
Wait.
Does Lim need bypass, too?

27:40.559 --> 27:42.895
We've only got enough tubing
and cannulas to operate
one machine.

27:43.029 --> 27:44.396
Resupply doesn't come in
until 5:00 a.m.

27:50.436 --> 27:52.171
Are we pretending
that there's a debate?

27:52.304 --> 27:54.606
We're not risking Lim's life
for this man.

28:00.246 --> 28:02.681
We do have another option.

28:02.815 --> 28:05.484
We can repair Lim's heart
with an occluder device.
She won't need bypass.

28:05.617 --> 28:07.854
No. No.
That is a terrible idea.

28:07.987 --> 28:09.789
Percutaneous closure
is too risky.

28:09.922 --> 28:12.691
Open heart surgery
is the optimal procedure
for traumatic VSD.

28:12.825 --> 28:17.129
I, I know, but he will die
without bypass.

28:17.263 --> 28:19.999
Lim's surgery will just be
harder without it, but doable.

28:20.132 --> 28:21.133
Do you agree?

28:25.838 --> 28:26.638
I agree with Dr. Andrews.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.877
No. This is not fair.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.678
Dr. Lim didn't hurt anyone.
He did.

28:32.812 --> 28:34.847
And now we need to help her.

28:34.981 --> 28:36.515
She needs the bypass machine.

28:38.985 --> 28:39.819
I've made my decision.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.770
I've deployed
the occluder device.

29:00.639 --> 29:02.074
Slipped through.

29:02.708 --> 29:03.675
Placing again.

29:06.645 --> 29:08.214
Looks good on the frontal.

29:08.347 --> 29:11.350
No. Still not seating.
We should have used bypass.

29:12.384 --> 29:14.186
Repositioning.

29:18.224 --> 29:19.358
Cardiac output's dropping.

29:22.061 --> 29:25.197
- She's in fulminant
heart failure.
- No. No.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.568
- Murphy.
- No.

29:29.701 --> 29:31.904
- Shaun.
- I-I can't.

29:32.038 --> 29:32.905
No!

29:33.039 --> 29:34.740
I can't. I said it wouldn't--

29:34.874 --> 29:35.942
Shaun, it's okay.

29:36.075 --> 29:37.944
No, it's not. It's not okay.

29:38.077 --> 29:40.046
No!

29:40.179 --> 29:42.949
- No, it's not okay.
- Lea, get him out of here.

29:43.082 --> 29:45.484
- Shaun, let's go on a break.
- No, it is not okay!

29:45.617 --> 29:47.053
- I-I can't leave!
- Take a break.

29:47.186 --> 29:48.787
- Jerome,
get him out of here, now.
- I-I will not leave!

29:48.921 --> 29:50.456
- And get Glassman.
- I have to-- to--

29:50.589 --> 29:51.958
- Dr. Murphy, let's go. Come on.
- No, no, don't touch me!

29:52.091 --> 29:53.792
- Let's go.
- Shaun! Shaun!

29:53.926 --> 29:57.396
No, don't touch me!
Don't touch me, okay?
Don't-- Don't touch me!

29:57.529 --> 30:00.232
Don't touch me, okay?
Don't touch me!

30:03.569 --> 30:05.771
Okay.

30:05.905 --> 30:06.939
No.

30:11.978 --> 30:13.245
Okay.

30:14.380 --> 30:16.782
Okay. Okay. Okay.

30:16.916 --> 30:17.816
Hey. You know what?

30:19.685 --> 30:21.287
No!

30:37.069 --> 30:38.070
Shaun.

30:39.538 --> 30:40.306
I'm here.

30:43.109 --> 30:44.276
Shaun, can you--

30:45.477 --> 30:46.278
can you look at me?

30:48.280 --> 30:49.115
Shaun?

30:50.749 --> 30:51.450
Shaun?

30:53.986 --> 30:54.853
Shaun?

30:56.956 --> 30:58.290
Dr. Glassman, please.

30:59.591 --> 31:00.292
Shaun?

31:01.627 --> 31:03.195
Dr. Glassman, please,
we need you in there.

31:03.329 --> 31:05.297
If they're placing a device,
they need Shaun, not me.

31:07.566 --> 31:08.634
Shaun?

31:08.767 --> 31:10.102
Shaun, please.

31:11.403 --> 31:12.304
Look at me.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.674
Shaun? Shaun?

31:15.807 --> 31:16.475
<i>Shaun?</i>

31:17.643 --> 31:18.310
Shaun.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.151
It's a hell of
a wedding day, Shaun.

31:29.788 --> 31:32.091
I couldn't save you.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.194
You were a kid.

31:38.597 --> 31:40.332
You died because of me.

31:43.369 --> 31:45.704
I was walking backwards
on top of a train.

31:50.009 --> 31:52.844
You only left home
because of me.

31:56.615 --> 31:57.683
<i>Shaun?</i>

31:57.816 --> 31:58.784
Shaun?

32:01.553 --> 32:02.354
I gotta go.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.093
Maybe we should show him
the surgery?

32:07.226 --> 32:08.995
You said they needed Shaun.

32:09.128 --> 32:11.597
Video-call me from the inside
and we'll show him the problem.

32:13.899 --> 32:14.533
Okay.

32:21.573 --> 32:23.675
- Maybe there's not
enough uninjured tissue.
- It's not that.

32:23.809 --> 32:26.278
SVT. Push adenosine.

32:26.412 --> 32:28.547
Shaun?

32:28.680 --> 32:32.884
Shaun, I'm gonna show you
the front and lateral views.

32:33.019 --> 32:35.287
Can you see
why the device isn't seating?

32:39.191 --> 32:40.059
Shaun?

32:41.527 --> 32:42.394
Please focus.

32:44.030 --> 32:45.031
<i>You're right.</i>

32:46.298 --> 32:47.599
I left home
'cause I wanted to protect you.

32:51.237 --> 32:52.638
My big brother who I loved.

32:55.074 --> 32:56.408
Nothing could've changed that.

32:57.843 --> 32:59.445
Nothing could've changed
where I was that day.

33:04.716 --> 33:05.917
None of it is your fault.

33:08.554 --> 33:09.621
You remember what I said to you

33:09.755 --> 33:10.822
when I gave you
the scalpel, right?

33:12.958 --> 33:15.127
<i>Never forget.
You can do anything.</i>

33:18.297 --> 33:21.367
You can do this.
You can save your friend.

33:27.773 --> 33:28.740
You just need to look.

33:31.710 --> 33:33.545
Okay.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.047
Shaun?

33:43.122 --> 33:44.090
Shaun, can you see that?

34:01.540 --> 34:02.641
I know what to do.

34:12.518 --> 34:13.685
We need more pressors.
We're maxed out.

34:17.356 --> 34:19.525
There's a second VSD.

34:19.658 --> 34:20.559
We would have seen it.

34:20.692 --> 34:21.727
Here.

34:21.860 --> 34:24.696
We assumed it was
ventricular turbulence.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.098
It's oblong.

34:27.866 --> 34:30.569
Deploy a second device
and angle it posteriorly.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.409
Loading device.

34:47.853 --> 34:48.520
Angling.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.338
It's holding.

35:19.218 --> 35:20.118
Thank you, Shaun.

Hi.

37:01.119 --> 37:03.221
Hello. I have to wait
for Dr. Lim to wake up.

37:03.355 --> 37:05.023
You should go home and sleep.

37:07.058 --> 37:10.696
I'm not spending
my wedding night
across town from you.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.364
I'll take a nap
in the residents' lounge.

37:16.368 --> 37:17.569
I saw Steve earlier.

37:19.771 --> 37:20.539
Oh.

37:23.509 --> 37:27.679
He told me
it wasn't my fault he died.

37:30.482 --> 37:31.550
Do you believe him?

37:34.353 --> 37:36.555
I'm... trying.

37:43.362 --> 37:44.596
Tonight was very hard.

37:51.870 --> 37:55.006
I would not have been able
to help Dr. Lim

37:55.140 --> 37:57.909
if you hadn't
shown me the surgery.

38:02.180 --> 38:03.782
As much
as I loved you before...

38:07.586 --> 38:09.087
I love you even more now.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.128
I am so happy you are my wife.

38:28.740 --> 38:30.241
Do you feel married now?

38:37.649 --> 38:39.818
I think I do.

39:05.076 --> 39:06.478
I thought
I was gonna die today.

39:08.447 --> 39:09.781
And I didn't think
about that job.

39:11.783 --> 39:12.784
I thought about you.

39:18.924 --> 39:20.459
I just e-mailed
New York Medical Center.

39:22.494 --> 39:23.695
I turned them down.

39:26.765 --> 39:27.966
You need to e-mail them back.

39:30.802 --> 39:31.870
Tell them you made a mistake.

39:42.213 --> 39:45.050
When you decided
to take the job...

39:46.918 --> 39:48.687
you chose your career over us.

39:52.491 --> 39:53.492
And, uh...

39:55.661 --> 39:56.828
I finally had to face it.

40:00.098 --> 40:01.467
That's who you are.

40:07.038 --> 40:09.040
And you're not gonna change.

40:11.142 --> 40:12.043
But I did change.

40:13.344 --> 40:14.546
Today.

40:18.550 --> 40:19.250
For the moment.

40:42.908 --> 40:44.242
Morning.

40:44.375 --> 40:45.076
Welcome back.

40:46.945 --> 40:49.214
I might need
a couple personal days.

40:49.347 --> 40:50.582
Okay, but don't go overboard.

40:50.716 --> 40:51.683
The boss is right here.

40:54.653 --> 40:56.522
Mm.

40:59.057 --> 41:01.192
I'm having trouble
with my legs.

41:03.361 --> 41:05.463
Probably some
post-surgical myopathy.

41:15.741 --> 41:17.142
Push against my hands.

41:19.044 --> 41:19.911
I am.

41:24.550 --> 41:25.416
Try again.

41:38.396 --> 41:39.430
You're paralyzed.
