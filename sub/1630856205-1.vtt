20:47.880 --> 20:49.960
for progress...

20:50.160 --> 20:51.020
- Mm-hmm.

20:51.220 --> 20:52.290
If you can't implement it

20:52.490 --> 20:53.570
in a place
like the Mississippi Delta,

20:53.770 --> 20:55.300
which has the highest
concentration

20:55.500 --> 20:56.920
of Black people
and the highest concentration

20:57.120 --> 20:58.300
- of poverty in the state...
- Mm-hmm.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.240
- Then it won't work
for the people

21:00.440 --> 21:03.470
who need it most nationwide.

21:03.670 --> 21:06.410
So this is the proving
grounds, I think.

21:06.610 --> 21:09.210
I mean, I don't know if I've
ever encountered anybody

21:09.410 --> 21:10.330
outside the South that's like,

21:10.530 --> 21:12.330
I can't wait to move
to Jackson, Mississippi,

21:12.530 --> 21:13.980
even though
it's the biggest city

21:14.180 --> 21:15.610
and it's the capital, right?

21:15.810 --> 21:17.920
I mean, I don't want
people to hear, like,

21:18.120 --> 21:19.420
the racism is worse here,

21:19.620 --> 21:22.260
but there is a history here.

21:22.460 --> 21:25.280
And I see a lot
of those historic patterns

21:25.480 --> 21:27.430
still playing out to this day.

21:27.630 --> 21:29.730
White people,
politically especially,

21:29.930 --> 21:34.940
have figured out a way to keep
and hold power politically.

21:35.140 --> 21:38.690
It's almost as if the more
Black people there are,

21:38.890 --> 21:43.410
the more vigorously certain
white people work to ensure

21:43.610 --> 21:45.410
that they stay in power
and the power

21:45.610 --> 21:46.470
doesn't get into the hands
of Black people.

21:46.670 --> 21:48.040
There's no "almost as if."

21:48.240 --> 21:49.580
That is the truth.

21:49.780 --> 21:54.040
So I mean,
the question then becomes,

21:54.240 --> 21:56.860
must a Black Power position

21:57.060 --> 22:00.650
forever be one of wooing

22:00.850 --> 22:04.320
and convincing and marching
and pleading?

22:04.520 --> 22:07.810
- Mm-hmm.
- Or...

22:08.010 --> 22:10.500
is it only logical to say,

22:10.700 --> 22:12.980
we must attain
some power of our own?

22:13.180 --> 22:14.310
- Black Power.
- [laughs]

22:14.510 --> 22:17.150
- Which, by the way,
the phrase is popularized

22:17.350 --> 22:18.650
- here in Mississippi.
- Yes, it was.

22:18.850 --> 22:21.820
- Stokely Carmichael,
one night in June 1966,

22:22.020 --> 22:24.010
Stokely gets up and said,
I've been arrested

22:24.210 --> 22:25.220
something like 31 times,

22:25.420 --> 22:26.350
and I'm not
getting arrested no more.

22:26.550 --> 22:27.390
We're not asking for--

22:27.590 --> 22:28.950
what we want now
is Black Power.

22:29.150 --> 22:30.500
- Every courthouse
in Mississippi

22:30.700 --> 22:32.160
ought to be burned down
tomorrow

22:32.360 --> 22:33.500
to get rid of the dirt
in here.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.330
Now, from now on, when they
ask you what you want,

22:35.530 --> 22:36.460
you know what to tell them.

22:36.660 --> 22:38.420
What do you want?
crowd: Black Power!

22:38.620 --> 22:40.460
- What do you want?
crowd: Black Power!

22:40.660 --> 22:42.170
- What do you want?
crowd: Black Power!

22:42.370 --> 22:44.200
- Don't be afraid.
Don't be ashamed.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.200
We want Black Power.
crowd: Black Power!

22:46.400 --> 22:47.410
We want Black Power.

22:47.610 --> 22:49.700
- I say this is
the place where you

22:49.900 --> 22:53.140
can see real change
and tangible results

22:53.340 --> 22:55.420
immediately, almost.

22:55.620 --> 22:58.420
So to your point,
if we're gonna make a go of it,

22:58.620 --> 23:00.710
the South makes a lot of sense.

23:00.910 --> 23:01.710
It certainly does.

23:01.910 --> 23:04.780
All that being said,
it would be nice

23:04.980 --> 23:09.050
to have the resources,

23:09.260 --> 23:12.100
because it's exhausting.

23:12.300 --> 23:14.670
Can Jackson change that?

23:14.860 --> 23:17.670
Are there ways that
they can position themselves

23:17.870 --> 23:21.130
as attractive alternatives
to other Southern cities

23:21.330 --> 23:22.440
where people are saying,

23:22.640 --> 23:24.550
I would really like
to move to?

23:24.750 --> 23:25.880
I certainly hope so.

23:26.080 --> 23:31.560
I think we start with
Southern heritage pilgrimages.

23:31.760 --> 23:34.310
And we put some
star power behind it

23:34.510 --> 23:38.150
in terms of people
who are nationally known

23:38.350 --> 23:44.300
and can give their testimony
of going on these pilgrimages

23:44.500 --> 23:45.700
all over the South.

23:45.900 --> 23:47.130
- Who should organize
that effort?

23:47.330 --> 23:48.430
You should.

23:48.630 --> 23:50.140
- I should?
- You should.

23:50.340 --> 23:51.600
Your idea.

23:51.800 --> 23:54.660
- But not big groups
that have staff

23:54.860 --> 23:56.000

- [laughing]

23:56.200 --> 23:56.870
- Me?
- No.

23:57.070 --> 23:58.330
- Can you imagine me
at my little desk

23:58.530 --> 24:01.250

40 million Black people?

24:01.450 --> 24:03.610
[laughing]

24:03.810 --> 24:07.740
- With regard to bringing
young people or any of us

24:07.940 --> 24:09.090
back to the South,

24:09.290 --> 24:11.260
what would that utopia
look like?

24:11.460 --> 24:14.180
- Don't think of them
as utopias.

24:14.380 --> 24:16.020
There are no Wakandas.

24:16.220 --> 24:17.160

24:35.320 --> 24:37.620

24:37.820 --> 24:41.960
- Boy, that sounds familiar
for Jackson, does it not?

All Black boys.

41:16.550 --> 41:17.980
And the kids in the A-class,

41:18.180 --> 41:19.980
<i>we were being pushed</i>
<i>to the Ivy League schools</i>

41:20.180 --> 41:22.250

<i>that we would not come back.</i>

41:22.450 --> 41:23.150
Really?

41:23.350 --> 41:25.380
- See, I felt I had
to leave the South.

41:25.580 --> 41:26.920
I felt like
if I didn't leave...

41:27.120 --> 41:28.880
- Hey.
How's it going?

41:29.080 --> 41:32.600
- I was gonna have a life
like everybody else's I knew,

41:32.800 --> 41:34.310
and I wanted
a different kind of life.

41:34.510 --> 41:35.470
Right.

41:35.670 --> 41:37.480
- And I understood
that in doing that,

41:37.680 --> 41:41.480
I was yanking myself away
from people I grew up with.

41:41.680 --> 41:43.380
But I felt like if I didn't,

41:43.580 --> 41:45.650
I was gonna miss
something in life.

41:45.850 --> 41:47.720
And if I had stayed in it,

41:47.920 --> 41:49.570
I don't think I would have
been a happy man.

41:49.770 --> 41:52.950
- But are we walking examples
of a Black community

41:53.150 --> 41:56.680
brain drain in service
of our own ambitions?

41:56.880 --> 41:58.620
Well, I would reject that.

41:58.820 --> 42:02.630
It is sort of the nature
of life in modernity

42:02.830 --> 42:04.800
that people leave places,

42:04.990 --> 42:06.670
smaller places
where they were born,

42:06.870 --> 42:08.510
to actualize themselves

42:08.710 --> 42:11.470
and to have an impact
on the world.

42:11.670 --> 42:12.970

42:13.170 --> 42:16.200

New Orleans, right?

42:24.910 --> 42:25.650

the perimeter of their
properties with a shotgun.

43:00.110 --> 43:01.120
You can drink.

43:06.510 --> 43:07.420

- Right.

43:07.620 --> 43:08.420

to be said for that.

43:08.620 --> 43:09.630
Right.

43:09.830 --> 43:12.490
- However, oftentimes
in my family and others,

43:12.690 --> 43:14.530

a young man who was not

43:14.730 --> 43:16.370
- going to be subservient...
- Mm-hmm.

43:16.570 --> 43:17.970
- They sent him North
immediately

43:18.170 --> 43:19.970
because they knew
he wasn't gonna last.

43:20.170 --> 43:21.430
- He was gonna be killed.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

43:21.630 --> 43:22.580
Mm-hmm.

43:22.780 --> 43:25.540
- So to retreat, I think...
- Mm-hmm.

43:25.740 --> 43:26.840
To the North

43:27.030 --> 43:30.260
was a way, to some extent,
strengthening ourselves

43:30.460 --> 43:31.720
to move forward in history.

43:31.910 --> 43:34.550
- But I argue
that when people moved away,

43:34.750 --> 43:37.930

the Black community

of communities.

43:40.320 --> 43:43.850

of revolutionary nature

43:49.060 --> 43:52.170

amazing about the South,

43:52.370 --> 43:54.800

43:55.000 --> 43:57.280
- It would be a healing thing...
- Mm-hmm.

43:57.480 --> 43:59.510
- To me to bring both
of those things back together.

43:59.710 --> 44:02.370
That's the way
I think about it.

44:02.570 --> 44:04.210

it's possible--

44:04.410 --> 44:05.370

44:05.570 --> 44:08.650

meant what?

49:59.510 --> 50:01.330

50:18.820 --> 50:20.850

as a Black person,

55:00.500 --> 55:02.470
could own your actual block.

55:10.910 --> 55:14.420

55:14.620 --> 55:18.210
Every day, I would just, like,
run in the house after work

55:18.410 --> 55:20.820
and didn't speak to anybody.

55:21.020 --> 55:24.260
We--a bullet had went
through our house,

55:24.460 --> 55:26.260
right through our front door.

55:26.460 --> 55:27.560
<i>I couldn't take it anymore.</i>

55:27.760 --> 55:29.930
<i>I felt like I'm a prisoner</i>
<i>in my own home.</i>

55:30.130 --> 55:34.310
And when I was in Georgia,
my father's side of the family

55:34.510 --> 55:36.210
had already migrated there.

55:36.410 --> 55:38.670
The homes were
just so beautiful.

55:38.870 --> 55:41.130
The neighborhood was quiet.
It seemed safe.

55:41.330 --> 55:43.950
And so I just thought
it would be a good place

55:44.150 --> 55:45.840
for us to start over.

55:46.050 --> 55:48.090
And so then what changed?

55:49.470 --> 55:52.390
- I always get teary-eyed
about this.

55:52.590 --> 55:54.000
I really don't know
what happened that day.

55:54.200 --> 55:57.420
I just really feel like
some spirit or something--

55:57.620 --> 55:59.230
but I was looking
out my window.

55:59.430 --> 56:00.570
It's a vacant lot,

56:00.770 --> 56:02.190
and there was
this beautiful little girl

56:02.390 --> 56:04.590
with a dress playing with dirt

56:04.790 --> 56:07.350
and literally throwing bottles
into the street.

56:07.550 --> 56:09.140
I remember it like yesterday.

56:09.340 --> 56:11.640
And I just--I told
my husband, I'm like,

56:11.840 --> 56:13.690
"I don't know
if I want to leave.

56:13.890 --> 56:17.480
"I think I want to try
to do something,

56:17.680 --> 56:21.070
and I want to start with these
young people on the block."

56:21.270 --> 56:24.700
And so the fear
started to chip away.

56:24.900 --> 56:27.260
- So you believe
you changed this block?

56:27.460 --> 56:29.330
I know I did.

56:29.530 --> 56:31.270
So this is the strip
I'm trying to turn

56:31.470 --> 56:32.370
into Black Wall Street.

56:32.570 --> 56:35.210
I'm just looking at all
of these vacant properties.

56:35.410 --> 56:36.290
Okay.

56:36.490 --> 56:39.800
- It's, to me, as bad
as it looks, still opportunity

56:39.990 --> 56:41.550
because this is still
a bus route

56:41.750 --> 56:43.050
and still a corridor.

56:43.250 --> 56:44.970
It just has no life to it.

56:45.170 --> 56:46.910
This is the building
we're working on right now.

56:47.110 --> 56:48.550
So I'm in the process
of taking ownership...

56:48.750 --> 56:50.350
- This one here?
- Of that building, yes.

56:50.550 --> 56:53.730
And Rage offices would be
at the top of that.

56:53.930 --> 56:56.020
- You are encouraging
Black Chicago

56:56.220 --> 56:58.560
- to stay here and stay intact.
- I am. This our city.

56:58.760 --> 57:01.130
- I have written a book
encouraging Black people...

57:01.330 --> 57:02.300
- Them to go.
[laughs]

57:02.500 --> 57:05.630
- In Chicago and other cities
to move back to the South.

57:05.830 --> 57:08.470
How do you consider that
in the context

57:08.670 --> 57:09.970
of your strong desire
for Black people

57:10.170 --> 57:11.370
to stay in Chicago?

57:11.570 --> 57:13.870
- You look at how Chicago
is set up--

57:14.070 --> 57:15.640
hyper-segregated,

57:15.840 --> 57:17.830
the disinvestments on
the south and the west side,

57:18.030 --> 57:19.810
where Black people
actually live--

57:20.010 --> 57:21.880
yeah, you say, okay,

57:22.080 --> 57:26.170
the city is apparently
pushing blacks out

57:26.370 --> 57:29.430
or is not trying
to retain them to stay.

57:29.630 --> 57:32.830
And if you don't shift
your mindset of, like,

57:33.030 --> 57:36.230
well, maybe this is
a opportunity to rebuild,

57:36.430 --> 57:38.560
then you would say,
"You know what?

57:38.760 --> 57:41.460
The hell with this. I'm gone.
I'm gonna start over."

57:41.660 --> 57:43.190

what is this school?

57:43.390 --> 57:44.170

58:19.010 --> 58:19.770
Some community--

59:38.260 --> 59:40.830
it's like the devil you know
versus the devil you don't.

59:42.580 --> 59:44.460
<i>Our dispersal</i>
<i>all over the country</i>

59:44.660 --> 59:46.270
<i>essentially diluted</i>

59:46.470 --> 59:48.800
<i>our ability</i>
<i>to influence elections.</i>

59:49.000 --> 59:51.260
<i>But the movement</i>
<i>that you're seeing,</i>

59:51.460 --> 59:52.820
<i>I wish I could say</i>
<i>it had to do</i>

59:53.020 --> 59:55.410
<i>with a conscious pursuit</i>
<i>of political power.</i>

59:55.610 --> 59:56.470
But it doesn't.

59:56.670 --> 59:58.410
In most cases, I think
it's because people are just

59:58.610 --> 01:00:00.430
fleeing the crime
and the violence,

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:01.830
<i>and they're looking</i>
<i>for a better life.</i>

01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:03.750
<i>They want to provide</i>
<i>a better opportunity</i>

01:00:03.950 --> 01:00:05.100
<i>for their children.</i>

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.980
<i>It's not reverse migration</i>
<i>to the South,</i>

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:11.380
<i>but it's reverse migration</i>
<i>out of the big cities.</i>

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:13.430
- At the surface,
when someone looks

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:14.990
at an idea like this,
they're gonna say,

01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:16.780
<i>"Well, is he calling</i>
<i>for Black supremacy?</i>

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:18.660
"Is he giving up
on integration?

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:20.100
Is this about
self-segregation?"

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:23.520
- For the last 90 years,
every state in America

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.830
except Hawaii has been
majority white.

01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:28.840
No one says that that's
a problem for integration.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.740
But advocating that
Black people might one day be

01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:34.740
one percentage point
over 50% in a state,

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:36.570
that freaks people out.

01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:40.450
- And so your prescription
is that

01:00:40.650 --> 01:00:42.810
I leave my comfortable
apartment

01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:45.620
on the East Side of New York

01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:50.250
and move back home
to Rayne, Louisiana?

01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:52.970
- For people who are
well-established where you are

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.650
and you feel safe,
more importantly,

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:59.470
and that your family is safe
in that space, stay there.

01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:01.540
This is not for you.

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:03.330
Stay where you are.

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.780
- Yeah, like, the idea
of making this move

01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:00.390
from the Amtrak corridor

01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:02.030
that I've grown up
my whole life in,

01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:04.220
it gave me a little bit
of pause, I guess.

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.160
But one of the concerns

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:09.960
is that people who are
my demographic,

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:12.060
they're gonna have
some very unique friction

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:14.550
that they're gonna cut through
as this leading edge.

01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:15.670
- But let me just--

01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:17.110
I'm gonna cut
to something here,

01:02:17.310 --> 01:02:19.510
because I think
what you're saying is,

01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:21.640
when Black people leave

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:24.140
Northern and Western cities
and states,

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:27.560
they'll be leaving places
that are more liberal,

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:28.910
health policy,
maybe educational policy...

01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:31.360
- Sure. Sure.
- Maybe--whatever.

01:02:31.550 --> 01:02:33.420
And they're gonna leave that,
and they'll come to places

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:34.570
that right now,

01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:36.900
before the change is
really made...

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:39.530
- Right.
- May be more hostile to them.

01:02:39.730 --> 01:02:40.930
- I get that, but--
- Yeah.

01:02:41.130 --> 01:02:43.660
- But I guess
I look at the issues

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:45.640
that face Black America
as multivariant...

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:46.700
- Mm-hmm.
- And that's one variant.

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:48.710
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, part of the reason

01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:52.150
I wrote this book was because
of what happened to you.

01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:55.920
<i>- Yeah, so I was</i>
<i>a junior in college,</i>

01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:01.220
<i>and Yale's campus has a series</i>
<i>of breakings and enterings.</i>

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:03.320
So I look over my shoulder
and I see this police officer.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.560
And I hear this guy saying,
like, "I got him."

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:10.120
He's, like, talking into his,
like, shoulder-mounted radio.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.460
And I turn around.

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.020
And it's this Black
police officer.

01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:15.000
He's unholstering his weapon.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.940
I put my hands up.
I got down on my knees.

01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.030
I laid on my stomach.

01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:20.030
What I was thinking of
is just, like,

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:23.590
how can I make myself
as nonthreatening as possible?

01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:25.850
I tell him, you know,
my ID is in my pocket.

01:03:26.050 --> 01:03:30.020
And then he stands me up,
and he goes away.

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:33.380
You know, Eric Garner had
very recently been murdered.

01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:36.880
You see all of these
Black people getting killed.

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.190
And I remember
thinking at the time,

01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:40.970
like, it's just important
for me to make sure

01:03:41.170 --> 01:03:44.890
that I don't introduce
some, you know, rogue element

01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:47.700
to cast more doubt
over my story.

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:49.060
I didn't do anything,
like, fishy in between.

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:51.100
I didn't, like, tweet
or do anything wild.

01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:53.440
I just, like--
I followed the script.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:58.960
- But your first thought is,
I've seen them animalize...

01:03:59.160 --> 01:03:59.900
- Mm-hmm.

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:01.950
- And dehumanize
so many Black men

01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:03.180
that I just need to make sure

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:04.660
that that does not happen
to me.

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:05.680
Right.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:10.120
I want, at some point,

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.680
for Black boys...

01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.000
- Mm-hmm.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:16.920
- To live in a world where
they do not have to think

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.070
about protecting
their humanity

01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:25.640
when they are the victims
of the system.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:28.140
But when you live
in a whole system

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:29.930
where a boy who has
never seen a gun

01:04:30.130 --> 01:04:33.600
knows to drop to his knees
when he sees it,

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.520
when you live
in a whole system

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.150
where a boy who has just had

01:04:37.350 --> 01:04:40.940
a gun pulled on him,
his first instinct

01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:45.700
is to prevent that power
from dehumanizing him

01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:48.490
rather than responding to him,

01:04:48.690 --> 01:04:51.830
that system is a problem,

01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:55.540
and that system is not set up
to protect Black boys

01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:58.640
but to prey on Black boys.

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.720
Personally,
at the end of the day,

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:13.950
I have to figure out
if I am being

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.960
an apostle of Black Power

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.790
or if I'm like the Don Quixote
of Black Power.

01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:22.730
Am I chasing windmills?

01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:27.200
<i>What if Black people</i>
<i>in America</i>

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:32.310
simply accept

01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:36.580
a position
of this level of powerlessness

01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:41.150
and accept
that their only recourse

01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:47.030
is to plead with other people
to change?

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:55.000
If we're gonna keep
the bent-knee posture,

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:59.060
then that is incredibly
disheartening to me.

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:05.280
And that is not to say
that this is the only...

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.010
solution,

01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:10.590
but it's the only one
that I see.

01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:15.700
<i>Here in Atlanta</i>
<i>and around Atlanta,</i>

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:17.620
<i>you know,</i>
<i>people who come here,</i>

01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:19.750
<i>they're not returning</i>
<i>and sitting on their hands.</i>

01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:21.150
<i>They are becoming engaged.</i>

01:06:21.350 --> 01:06:24.360
<i>They are active.</i>
<i>They are informed.</i>

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:28.590
And that dovetails beautifully
with the thesis,

01:06:28.790 --> 01:06:31.160
which is that the people
that you would get to return

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.490
would be the active people.

01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:36.640
- Hey, hey, hey.
What's happening, everybody?

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:38.890
- How are you?
- Oh, good.

01:06:39.090 --> 01:06:41.620
Oh, we got some lit in.

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:45.670
- So first of all,
I want to just talk to you

01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:46.900
about your journey...

01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:49.050
- Mm-hmm.
- Into this work.

01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:50.160
- So, you know,
I'm an immigrant.

01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:51.890
- I was born in Nigeria.
- Okay.

01:06:52.090 --> 01:06:53.390
<i>Raised in Southwest Atlanta.</i>

01:06:53.590 --> 01:06:55.660
<i>I'm an Atlanta</i>
<i>public school graduate.</i>

01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.870
- One thing that I learned
just in researching the book

01:06:58.070 --> 01:07:01.580
was that the South was
the number one destination

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:03.420
for African immigrants.

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:04.520
I did not know this.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.300
I just assumed that it would
be New York or somewhere.

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:09.740
- I mean, yes, there's a lot
of Africans in New York,

01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:11.030
but we're not built like that.

01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:14.070
- [laughs]
- Like, our--our continent.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.640
That's why we're in Atlanta,
New Orleans.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:18.410
It's like,
this feels familiar.

01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:19.520
[laughs]

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:24.770
<i>- So I was introduced</i>
<i>to Stacey Abrams in 2013.</i>

01:07:24.970 --> 01:07:26.280
She lays out
this brilliant idea

01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:27.940
for the New Georgia Project.

01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:29.950
I immediately am, like,
"Girl, let me tell you

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:32.530
all of the reasons
why this is never gonna work."

01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:34.700
And she was like,
"Here are all of the reasons

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:36.060
"why it absolutely will work.

01:07:36.260 --> 01:07:37.390
"I've gone through them all.

01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:39.560
Here's my spreadsheet," right?
[laughs]

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.060
And so that began
a series of conversations

01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:43.940
that led to start
the New Georgia Project.

01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:45.960
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:49.240
<i>- In November 2020</i>
<i>and January 2021,</i>

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.880
we elected Joe Biden,
we elected Jon Ossoff,

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.010

[cheers and applause]

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:58.850
<i>- What happened in 2020 in</i>
<i>Georgia was transformational.</i>

01:07:59.050 --> 01:08:01.120
<i>And it was in large part</i>
<i>because of</i>

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:02.960
<i>the reverse migration</i>

- You'll see the official call
on our screen.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:07.860
- And they did it
while not getting

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:10.360
all the way to majority Black.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.240
<i>That's huge.</i>

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:17.100
<i>And just with that movement,</i>

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:20.140
[cheers and applause]

01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:23.580
<i>But with those victories</i>
<i>came backlash</i>

01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:26.250
<i>to thwart the power</i>
<i>of the Black vote</i>

01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:29.760
<i>before the 2022 midterms.</i>

01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:31.990
- I think the thing that
challenges me in this moment

01:08:32.190 --> 01:08:34.090
is that there is the X factor

01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:35.390
of these
voter suppression bills.

01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:36.490
Right.

01:08:36.690 --> 01:08:38.620
- There are a lot of people
in power right now

01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:41.100
today in Georgia
who believe in the big lie

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:44.960
and who are using 2022
as an opportunity

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:46.900
to get their lick back.

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:49.360
And these reverse migrants,
these folks

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:53.400
that are moving back from
New York and D.C. and Chicago

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:56.970
make it more difficult to draw
majority white districts.

01:08:57.170 --> 01:08:58.640
But they continue to try.

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:00.910
- Do you really believe
they believe in it,

01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:02.960
or are they using it
because they wanted

01:09:03.150 --> 01:09:04.370
- to get a lick anyway?
- Right.

01:09:04.570 --> 01:09:06.020
I don't know if it matters,

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:07.810
because they are taking
the actions.

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:10.210
- Right.
- They are doing the things.

01:09:10.410 --> 01:09:12.130
And what they couldn't
accomplish through violence

01:09:12.330 --> 01:09:15.130
on January 6th, they then
went to state legislatures

01:09:15.330 --> 01:09:16.530
all across the country.

01:09:16.730 --> 01:09:21.390
Over 400 anti-voting bills
introduced in 49 states.

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:23.230
Georgia was one of the first
'cause we know

01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:25.310
how to innovate
with some voter suppression.

01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:28.480
So Senate Bill 202
is the bill.

01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:32.170
It is a big, gnarly,
comprehensive,

01:09:32.370 --> 01:09:33.740
voter suppression,

01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:34.950
"You Black folks will never

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:37.220
get away with this again"
bill.

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:41.390
It creates five new crimes
related to voting,

01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:43.220
like the sort of
criminalization

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:45.250
of line-warming activities,

01:09:45.450 --> 01:09:48.750
so giving voters water,
which is really hostile.

01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:52.020
So what they were not able
to accomplish with violence...

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:53.130
Right.

01:09:53.330 --> 01:09:55.190
- They have been
successful with

01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:57.800
in state legislatures
all around the country,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:58.930
including Georgia.

01:09:59.130 --> 01:10:00.350
Yet in the primaries,

01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:03.140
we still saw
really high voter turnout.

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:04.200
That's correct.

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.850
- The proponents
of voter suppression say,

01:10:07.050 --> 01:10:10.310
"Haha, this means
that you people

01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:13.320
"who were saying that this is
gonna create a problem

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.590
"for voters were lying.

01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:19.050
Actually, we have more voters,
not fewer voters."

01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:20.890
How do you respond to that?

01:10:21.090 --> 01:10:22.890
- I think it's because
of the campaigns

01:10:23.090 --> 01:10:25.160
that happened
by groups like ours,

01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:26.500
the New Georgia Project.

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:28.500
It is because
Americans don't like it

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:31.110
when you take their shit,
right?

01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:32.570
And people understand,
until we're able

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:35.460
to change the leaders
in the legislature,

01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:39.280
overwhelming turnout,
overwhelming participation

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:42.510
is literally the only thing
that we have

01:10:42.710 --> 01:10:45.740
that can guarantee
that the will of the people

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:50.000
is reflected in the results
of our elections.

01:10:52.210 --> 01:10:54.570
- So, Elijah,
where are we going now?

01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:58.570
- We are traveling
to Powder Springs, Georgia.

01:10:58.770 --> 01:11:00.800
We're gonna spend
a little time up there today

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.570
engaging some voters.

01:11:02.770 --> 01:11:05.700
- How did you get
into this work?

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:08.370
- I was born and raised
in one of the most

01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:10.830
dangerous neighborhoods
on the West Side of Chicago,

01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:12.080
Garfield Park.

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.670
And I attended
Morehouse College,

01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:17.480
and I graduated with a degree
in political science.

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:19.880
Knowing the environment
that I came from,

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:24.220
I felt like there was no one
who was willing to be invested

01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.390
and to see a change
within their community.

01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:28.270
So I took it upon myself.

01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:30.020
- Like, do you have
to get up courage

01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:31.600
to go knock
on a stranger's door

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.340
and not knowing
who's behind it?

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:36.690
- So I'm gonna share
a story from 2012.

01:11:36.890 --> 01:11:37.610
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:37.810 --> 01:11:39.360
- They dropped us
in this neighborhood.

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:43.030
And white man,
a little bit older,

01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:44.950
he opens the door.

01:11:45.150 --> 01:11:47.540
As I'm talking,
I see him moving.

01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:51.140
As I continue to talk,
I see what he's doing.

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:54.480
He actually grabbed a shotgun.

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:56.980
I said,
"I'm sorry to bother you.

01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:58.960
Thank you so much.
Have a good day."

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.320
And I actually went ahead
and went to the next door.

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.590
For me, that was
a defining moment

01:12:03.790 --> 01:12:07.870
because I know I'm doing
this work for a big purpose,

01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:12.330
and I care about it so much
that at that moment,

01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:15.330

my life didn't matter.

01:12:15.530 --> 01:12:18.460

01:13:30.150 --> 01:13:31.220
for being a registered nurse.

01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:33.810

01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:35.140
COVID.

01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:36.690
- Over the last 2,
2 1/2 years.

01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:39.650
- I'm telling you,
it has been--

01:13:39.850 --> 01:13:45.050
it has taken a lot of my soul.

01:13:46.050 --> 01:13:48.640

And I can remember
when I was in high school,

01:13:57.430 --> 01:14:00.250
and my counselor asked me
what I wanted to be.

01:14:00.450 --> 01:14:01.770
And I said
I wanted to be a nurse.

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:03.510

what she said to me?

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:04.940
"You could never."

01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:06.260

right now.

and those who are from here

this region off as Red,

that the parties,
Democrat and Republican,

01:20:27.670 --> 01:20:30.930
disinvest in statewide races,

01:20:31.130 --> 01:20:32.600
particularly where these
Black people are running

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:36.060
and literally begging
for money,

01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:39.880
is that Black people have yet
to demonstrate

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:42.510
that they can win,
they have the numbers...

01:20:42.710 --> 01:20:43.680
Yep.

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:46.330

deliver those states

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:47.950
on a presidential level.

01:20:48.150 --> 01:20:50.120
- And what the Democratic
Party fails to realize

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:51.790
is that people
who are on the ground

01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:53.060
actually know
what they're talking about.

01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:54.830
That's why our organization

the party dictating.

01:20:59.430 --> 01:21:01.130
I wanted the freedom

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:30.160
- Mm-hmm.

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:33.890
- But those who have the power
and don't want to see

01:21:34.090 --> 01:21:37.230
a sharing of that power
will do all that they can

01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:38.400

Wayne County.

equality and justice,

wanted good services
from your government,

01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:41.770
and wanted somebody to listen.

01:22:41.970 --> 01:22:44.570
- So they shifted you
into a demographic

01:22:44.770 --> 01:22:47.010
with fewer Black people.

01:22:47.210 --> 01:22:50.340
What does that mean for you
campaign-wise?

01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:52.010
- Number one,
they put you in a district

01:22:52.210 --> 01:22:53.870
that you knew nothing about

01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:56.600
and people who knew nothing
about you.

01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:00.080
