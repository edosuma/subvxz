00:03.837 --> 00:06.589
Steve Banerjee.
You're the creator of Chippendales.

00:07.132 --> 00:08.133
Yes. Yes, I am.

00:08.133 --> 00:09.217
Here you go.

00:09.217 --> 00:10.677
<i>You missed the deposition.</i>

00:10.677 --> 00:12.012
It's a class-action lawsuit.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.722
You have to take this seriously.

00:13.722 --> 00:15.306
This could destroy us financially.

00:15.306 --> 00:18.143
<i>No matter what shady,
scheming bullshit is going down,</i>

00:18.143 --> 00:20.020
there's one person
who'll have your back.

00:20.020 --> 00:24.774
Everybody's trying to copy me.
Profit off what I built. My hard work.

00:25.191 --> 00:27.902
- You swore an oath of loyalty, Ray.
- I know that.

00:27.902 --> 00:29.195
Then show me you meant it.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.282
I'm talking about a tour.
A Chippendales tour.

00:32.574 --> 00:34.034
<i>So I get half the profit...</i>

00:34.034 --> 00:36.077
You... You understand all that?

00:36.077 --> 00:38.121
<i>How do you know
he's being real with you</i>

00:38.121 --> 00:39.622
about how much money is coming in?

00:39.622 --> 00:42.167
<i>By the looks of things...
Something ain't right.</i>

00:50.341 --> 00:51.801
You are king of the jungle.

00:51.801 --> 00:53.344
You own that stage, guys.

00:53.344 --> 00:55.513
Scotty, hat back.
I wanna see those eyes.

00:55.513 --> 00:57.474
I wanna see those hungry eyes.

00:57.766 --> 00:59.267
Okay, back straight.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.477
Dicks hard.

01:00.685 --> 01:01.853
<i>Here they are!</i>

01:01.853 --> 01:03.938
Energy, energy, energy!

01:03.938 --> 01:06.024
<i>The men of Chippendales!</i>

01:06.024 --> 01:07.650
Go, go, go!

01:08.902 --> 01:11.112
Go, go, go!

01:15.492 --> 01:17.660
I fucking love Cleveland.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.997
This is Cincinnati!

01:21.956 --> 01:23.374
What's the difference?

02:18.930 --> 02:20.306
Give it to me.

02:23.434 --> 02:24.644
Shake it. Shake it.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.104
- Blow on 'em.
- Shake it.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.064
- Blow on 'em.
- Shake it, shake it.

02:28.064 --> 02:31.943
- Yeah. I think that works in my favor.
- One, two... Six...

02:31.943 --> 02:36.656
- Boardwalk! It's my favorite hotel.
- Come on.

02:37.031 --> 02:38.324
Pay up, sucker.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.451
Bradford, do you have any more coke?

02:40.451 --> 02:41.744
Check my toiletry.

02:41.744 --> 02:44.497
- It's in a fancy vial.
- Count it and count it good.

02:44.497 --> 02:45.790
How could you do that to me?

02:45.790 --> 02:49.085
Well, all's fair in love
and <i>Monopoly,</i> honey.

02:49.752 --> 02:51.379
Your ruthlessness is a real turn-on.

02:51.379 --> 02:52.714
- Oh, yeah.
- Get over here.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.757
How much of a turn-on is it?

02:54.757 --> 02:56.050
Jesus. Get a room.

02:56.050 --> 02:57.260
This is our room, Denise.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.428
Yeah, Denise.

02:58.803 --> 03:00.013
It's raining.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.140
Come on.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.560
So much for sleep.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.145
We can sleep on the bus.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.355
We can sleep when we're dead.

03:09.814 --> 03:12.400
- Let me in here, you.
- Okay, help!

03:14.027 --> 03:17.030
Hey, Scott.
It's Denise from Chippendales.

03:17.405 --> 03:20.825
I'm calling about those October dates
we talked about.

03:21.117 --> 03:24.162
So, the 22nd is looking best for us.

03:24.704 --> 03:27.040
We just added a Grand Rapids show
on the 21st,

03:27.040 --> 03:29.334
so I'm just thinking we'll come
right to your club.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.960
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>
- What?

03:30.960 --> 03:32.212
<i>I'm just a little confused.</i>

03:33.421 --> 03:34.547
Mmm-hmm?

03:34.547 --> 03:35.632
<i>You're already booked.</i>

03:36.424 --> 03:37.842
What do you mean?

03:38.134 --> 03:39.260
October 14th.

03:39.260 --> 03:40.720
You're playing our theater.

03:42.555 --> 03:43.973
When did we book? I didn't...

03:43.973 --> 03:45.892
- I didn't...
<i>- Not you. The other guy.</i>

03:45.892 --> 03:48.061
- Who, Nick?
<i>- No.</i>

03:49.229 --> 03:51.564
- Bradford.
<i>- I forget his name.</i>

03:51.564 --> 03:52.649
He was...

03:54.317 --> 03:55.693
He had an accent.

03:56.694 --> 03:58.404
Are you insane?

03:58.780 --> 04:01.991
You cannot fucking launch
a competing Chippendales tour.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.534
But, Nick, I just did.

04:03.534 --> 04:05.328
<i>Yes, well, you're going to stop.</i>

04:05.954 --> 04:07.288
I mean, I have every right.

04:07.288 --> 04:09.165
- It's my company.
<i>- Not the tour.</i>

04:09.165 --> 04:10.500
The tour is mine.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.168
You signed over the rights, remember?

04:12.418 --> 04:14.003
Yes. And what did I sign it on?

04:14.712 --> 04:16.089
A House of Pies napkin.

04:16.547 --> 04:18.007
Well, paper is paper, Steve.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.592
Expect to hear from my lawyer.

04:23.805 --> 04:24.931
Fucking asshole.

04:28.559 --> 04:30.103
Jesus Christ.

05:33.374 --> 05:37.128
"This court hereby grants
plaintiff's temporary restraining order

05:37.128 --> 05:38.755
"and preliminary injunction

05:38.755 --> 05:42.300
"so that Steve Banerjee may not utilize
the Chippendales name,

05:42.300 --> 05:45.219
"style or essence
in operating its tour."

05:47.430 --> 05:48.431
Fix it.

05:48.556 --> 05:51.392
- Fix what? The law?
- What if we change the name?

05:51.392 --> 05:54.687
Something like "Chippendales Experience"
or "Chippendales Mania"?

05:54.687 --> 05:56.981
You know, like the <i>Beatlemania</i>
Beatles show.

05:56.981 --> 05:59.067
You wanna do a tribute act
to your own tour?

05:59.067 --> 06:00.443
I'm just brainstorming.

06:00.443 --> 06:01.611
Look, I got to go.

06:01.819 --> 06:03.529
Thank you for coming by.

06:03.654 --> 06:04.739
Of course.

06:06.407 --> 06:07.700
Um...

06:08.534 --> 06:10.203
Oh! Right.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.038
Um...

06:13.748 --> 06:18.127
Could you maybe wait a week
to cash that?

06:20.004 --> 06:21.339
Thank you, Cheryl.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.094
He did this on purpose.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.845
He knew exactly what he was doing.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.056
Well, he duped you.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.350
- Hmm?
- You were duped.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.227
He tricked you.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.104
- Yes.
- Yes.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.773
None of this was your fault at all.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.525
That's right. Not at all.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.071
What are those?

06:45.071 --> 06:46.155
Pills.

06:53.121 --> 06:55.039
- Safe flight. Call me when you land.
- I will.

06:55.039 --> 06:56.207
Have you got your Valium?

06:56.207 --> 06:58.042
I know how you get with turbulence.

06:58.167 --> 06:59.210
I don't need anything.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.003
I'll be asleep when the plane takes off.

07:01.003 --> 07:02.964
I think you need something.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.466
- A little help would be good for you.
- I don't need help.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.009
I don't want you to be upset.

07:07.009 --> 07:08.177
Shouldn't we get going?

07:08.594 --> 07:10.596
- Yeah.
- Hey, Denise, can I have him alone

07:10.596 --> 07:12.723
- for just like, one minute?

07:13.641 --> 07:16.185
- Sorry.
- I'll be there in a second.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.438
- No, no. I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.856
I'll be there in a second.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.193
- Get on the bus.
- Go!

07:26.362 --> 07:27.405
That's got to stop.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.531
I know, I know.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.451
We just... We love each other.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.328
Well, great,
but I'm not in a relationship with her.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.166
You got to draw a line.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.419
So how about now?

07:42.211 --> 07:45.590
- What do you mean?
- I mean, don't get on the stupid bus...

07:45.590 --> 07:47.633
- Come on.
- ...and come back to New York with me.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.427
And leave her out here all alone?

07:56.142 --> 08:01.022
Look, the last thing I would want to do
is to ask you to choose between us.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.025
However...

08:12.825 --> 08:13.868
Call me when you land.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.580
You disappoint me terribly.

09:16.597 --> 09:17.807
Hey.

09:20.309 --> 09:21.519
What are you doing?

09:22.562 --> 09:24.272
Um...

09:26.190 --> 09:27.942
I think we have to sell the house.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.111
Okay, that's absurd.

09:30.444 --> 09:32.905
We're bouncing vendor checks,
between the lawsuit,

09:32.905 --> 09:35.074
the violations
and the calendar disaster.

09:35.074 --> 09:36.367
- We won't make it.
- Okay.

09:36.367 --> 09:39.036
- I know things are a little bumpy but...
- Bumpy?

09:39.954 --> 09:42.790
Stevie, we're bleeding money like crazy.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.917
If not for the New York club
and the tour...

09:44.917 --> 09:46.252
Oh, right, if not for Nick.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.462
- I didn't say...
- It's what you meant, didn't you?

09:48.462 --> 09:50.089
- You've gotta let it go!
- I have to?

09:50.089 --> 09:52.508
You're the one who talks about Nick
like he's our savior.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.343
Everything he touches
turns to gold. Nick.

09:54.343 --> 09:57.138
- You sound crazy!
- I sound crazy? I am capable, Irene!

09:58.431 --> 09:59.432
I'm...

10:02.143 --> 10:03.352
I am capable, Irene.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.399
Of course you are. I know you are.

10:13.112 --> 10:14.488
Trust me. I've got this.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.678
I got it.
I understand. I understand.

10:38.554 --> 10:40.723
- The show's going to begin soon.
- What are you doing?

10:41.015 --> 10:42.892
- Let them in.
- We're way over the limit.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.019
We've already been penalized
to the maximum.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.103
What does it matter?

10:46.103 --> 10:47.396
- I mean...
- Let them all in.

10:47.396 --> 10:48.648
- Right now.
- See?

10:48.648 --> 10:50.358
Welcome, ladies. $10.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.567
Welcome to Chippendales.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.319
Have a wonderful night.
Thank you.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.487
Thank you so much.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.613
Thank you.

10:55.613 --> 10:58.199
Have a good night.
Have a wonderful time. Thank you.

11:09.669 --> 11:10.670
Have a wonderful night.

11:10.961 --> 11:12.213
Thank you. $10.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.798
Thank you. Thank you.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.007
Have a wonderful night.

11:16.634 --> 11:17.718
Thank you.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.645
They are revoking your fire permit.

12:10.271 --> 12:12.356
You're going to have to
close your doors.

12:14.817 --> 12:15.901
For how long?

12:15.901 --> 12:17.987
If the city has its way, forever.

12:23.659 --> 12:25.828
We'll fight this.
We'll fight this in court.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.664
You've already paid for my kid's braces.

12:28.664 --> 12:30.291
You wanna pay for his bar mitzvah?

12:30.291 --> 12:32.376
It's over, Steve.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.379
- What's over?
- The club.

12:37.214 --> 12:38.716
Chippendales Los Angeles.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.344
It's over.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.858
That's a backwards three.

13:38.442 --> 13:39.777
We're all out of "E"s.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.071
Then why spell "tonight" like that?

13:42.196 --> 13:44.073
Huh?

13:44.073 --> 13:47.451
You spell tonight "T-O-N-I-G-H-T."

13:47.451 --> 13:51.831
So take the "E" off that
and put it in the Chippendales,

13:52.039 --> 13:53.874
and then our sign won't look like shit.

13:54.875 --> 13:55.960
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.005
- Oh, my God.
- Texas.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.257
- Whoo!
- Here we are.

14:03.676 --> 14:04.760
You've got this.

14:05.511 --> 14:06.762
Got what?

14:06.971 --> 14:08.264
This. All of this.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.598
Okay.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.643
So...

14:14.019 --> 14:15.729
I'm going to go back to New York.

14:16.605 --> 14:17.690
What?

14:17.898 --> 14:19.024
You don't need me.

14:20.442 --> 14:22.111
What are you talking about, Nick?

14:22.111 --> 14:23.279
Of course I need you.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.281
You don't.
I mean, maybe you haven't noticed,

14:25.281 --> 14:28.534
but you're doing everything.
You're booking the gigs.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.077
You're managing the dancers.

14:30.077 --> 14:31.495
You're coordinating the travel.

14:31.495 --> 14:33.622
I mean, you're in total fucking command.

14:33.622 --> 14:36.917
Most days I don't even need to come in.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.216
You wanna go to go be with him.

14:45.718 --> 14:46.760
I do.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.642
There's a million guys
to fuck on the road.

14:53.642 --> 14:55.394
I don't want to fuck other guys.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.605
We had a deal.

15:00.649 --> 15:02.234
- I know.
- What?

15:05.613 --> 15:06.739
But I love him.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.117
But we're the couple.

15:10.117 --> 15:11.285
We're not.

15:12.494 --> 15:13.537
Not really.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.586
You're gonna pick him over me?

15:20.711 --> 15:22.379
I think you're being unrealistic.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.632
Why not pick me?

15:25.215 --> 15:26.967
- You know why.
- You could pick me.

15:27.259 --> 15:28.344
Do I have to say it?

15:28.344 --> 15:29.887
Well, you were married to a woman.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.221
You've already done the thing.

15:31.221 --> 15:33.015
Yeah, because I was in love with her.

15:36.060 --> 15:39.229
Denise, can you just be happy for me?

15:40.773 --> 15:41.941
No.

15:42.107 --> 15:44.443
- Denise.
- Fuck you very much.

16:11.595 --> 16:12.638
<i>Guten Tag.</i>

16:13.973 --> 16:18.435
We will now discuss
the upcoming invasion of Europe.

16:18.435 --> 16:19.812
Wow.

16:19.812 --> 16:23.899
Yeah. The plan for European domination
is as follows.

16:24.066 --> 16:27.528
First, the Chippendale armies will land
in England,

16:27.653 --> 16:30.406
launching a full-scale assault
of the sexy.

16:31.949 --> 16:35.661
Then, we will move across the Channel,
where we will take Paris.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.539
- Uh-huh!
- Come here.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.209
- What?
- Come here.

16:47.256 --> 16:49.425
Those French broads won't know
what hit 'em.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.845
Absolute surrender.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.061
Hey.

17:21.457 --> 17:22.499
Hold that thought.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.502
- Why?
- I have to pee.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.004
I had three iced teas at lunch.

17:27.004 --> 17:28.172
I'll miss you.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.803
Not half as much as I'll miss you.

19:14.862 --> 19:18.532
Nick! Nick!

19:18.907 --> 19:21.577
Nick. Nick. No, no, no!

19:21.577 --> 19:24.955
Please, please! Jesus Christ.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.040
No, God!

19:30.085 --> 19:31.170
Hey!

19:31.170 --> 19:33.297
Help! Somebody help me!

19:34.798 --> 19:35.883
Will somebody...

19:38.218 --> 19:39.344
Help!

20:13.921 --> 20:15.047
Steve?

20:18.342 --> 20:19.468
Steve?

20:20.427 --> 20:21.511
Irene?

20:24.181 --> 20:25.182
What's going on?

20:28.560 --> 20:31.271
- It's Nick.
- What about Nick?

20:33.023 --> 20:34.107
He's dead.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.443
- What?
- He was murdered.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.654
- What?
- This morning, in the New York office.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.447
Somebody just came in and shot him.

20:42.199 --> 20:43.325
Who?

20:43.659 --> 20:44.785
I don't know.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.205
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.343
Was anyone there?

21:02.386 --> 21:03.470
What?

21:05.138 --> 21:07.975
Did anybody see the murder happen?

21:08.100 --> 21:09.226
I don't know.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.394
I'm not sure.

21:11.061 --> 21:13.438
- Well, who told you?
- Bobby.

21:15.482 --> 21:17.150
And how did Bobby hear about it?

21:18.610 --> 21:20.445
Bradford, because he found the body.

21:21.363 --> 21:22.614
But he didn't witness it.

21:24.157 --> 21:25.200
No, he was...

21:25.534 --> 21:27.119
Um...

21:27.119 --> 21:29.913
He was down the hall and then he heard
the gunshot, and then...

21:30.747 --> 21:32.124
And then he found Nick.

21:41.341 --> 21:43.051
Sounds like just a random robbery.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.137
Hmm?

21:45.137 --> 21:48.807
You know, just a random stick-up
or something like that.

21:49.474 --> 21:50.851
That's what it sounds like.

21:54.855 --> 21:55.981
Yeah, maybe.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.401
New York is such
a terribly violent place.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.032
Can't believe it.

22:09.870 --> 22:10.954
Steve.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.126
I'm sorry.

22:17.419 --> 22:19.421
I know you two
weren't exactly the closest.

22:20.630 --> 22:23.633
Yeah, we had our differences,
but I would never wish harm upon him.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.513
Of course not.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.629
(IN DISTANCE) Steve!

23:02.047 --> 23:03.048
Steve!

23:04.049 --> 23:05.384
Fucking murderer!

23:05.759 --> 23:06.843
Steve!

23:08.678 --> 23:10.889
Steve! Steve!

23:11.848 --> 23:12.849
Steve!

23:14.309 --> 23:15.435
Steve!

23:16.645 --> 23:17.979
You're a killer!

23:21.400 --> 23:22.651
Steve!

23:24.861 --> 23:28.949
Steve, I will see you in jail,
you fucking shit!

23:29.658 --> 23:30.867
Steve!

23:32.202 --> 23:34.538
- You're a murderer.
- Hey, hey. Denise. Denise.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.123
- I know what you did.
- Hey, hey.

23:36.123 --> 23:38.375
Be quiet. There are neighbors.
It's early morning.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.127
Just talk quietly and we can talk.

23:40.127 --> 23:43.422
Tell me why you ripped
my fucking heart out!

23:43.422 --> 23:44.589
- Stop talking.
- Murderer!

23:44.589 --> 23:46.425
- Take a deep breath.
- Where's Irene?

23:46.425 --> 23:49.010
Get in the car and leave,
and then we'll talk later, okay?

23:49.010 --> 23:50.720
You talk to me.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.515
You're drunk. Go sleep and then
come back and we can talk, okay?

23:53.515 --> 23:54.724
You're saying crazy shit.

23:54.724 --> 23:57.769
- Shut it.
- Am I being crazy or am I being sane?

23:57.769 --> 23:59.187
You fucking piece of shit!

23:59.354 --> 24:01.731
What game are you playing?

24:01.731 --> 24:04.651
I can see it in your eyes.
You killed him!

24:04.776 --> 24:06.153
You're a murderer!

24:06.153 --> 24:07.279
Irene!

24:07.279 --> 24:09.197
Denise, you have to stop
screaming, sweetie.

24:09.197 --> 24:10.657
You're too loud. What's going on?

24:10.657 --> 24:12.117
She's drunk or on drugs.

24:12.117 --> 24:14.035
- She's not making any sense.
- Look at me.

24:14.035 --> 24:15.245
You're screaming.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.456
All right. I'm so glad you're here.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.748
She's not making any sense.

24:18.748 --> 24:21.877
- Your husband's a murderer.
- Not making any sense. You're not.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.378
You're with a murderer.

24:23.545 --> 24:26.131
- Shut up!
- You do know what I'm saying.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.841
One second, okay? We have neighbors.

24:27.841 --> 24:29.009
Watch him.

24:31.219 --> 24:33.430
You. Nick...

24:33.430 --> 24:34.723
- Nick...
- Nick was my friend.

24:34.723 --> 24:36.099
Fuck! You know you did it.

24:36.099 --> 24:37.434
- Are you in on it?
- Be quiet.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.311
You have blood on your hands, Irene.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.770
- Shut up!
- Blood on your hands.

24:40.770 --> 24:41.897
How dare you?

24:41.897 --> 24:43.273
Blood on your hands.

24:44.357 --> 24:47.277
You have blood on your hands.

24:47.277 --> 24:49.362
- We have to call the police.
- Listen.

24:49.362 --> 24:50.530
She's losing her mind.

24:50.530 --> 24:52.115
- We don't need to.
- She's at the gate

24:52.115 --> 24:53.575
in front of our house, screaming.

24:53.575 --> 24:56.203
- She'll calm down and go home.
- No, we have to call the cops.

24:56.203 --> 24:57.704
Think about this for a second.

24:57.704 --> 24:59.706
- No, I'm calling.
- Do not call the police!

25:05.420 --> 25:06.421
Okay.

25:10.967 --> 25:12.636
We don't need to call the police.

25:16.181 --> 25:17.224
Okay?

25:25.065 --> 25:26.650
I'm gonna go check on the baby.

25:37.118 --> 25:38.161
Steve.

25:50.048 --> 25:53.510
I noticed there was $15,000
missing from the safe.

25:59.766 --> 26:01.393
What did you do with that money?

26:06.147 --> 26:07.857
What did you do with that money?

26:10.068 --> 26:11.778
What did you do
with that money?

26:14.447 --> 26:15.574
Oh, my God.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.868
- Irene.
- Oh, my God!

26:18.994 --> 26:20.161
- No!
- Irene!

26:20.704 --> 26:22.205
Irene, baby, what's going on?

26:22.455 --> 26:23.582
Irene, talk to me.

26:24.040 --> 26:25.041
Irene.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.085
- Please, please...
- No.

26:27.085 --> 26:28.503
Hey, Irene, baby, please.

26:28.503 --> 26:30.422
Do you really think I would do that?

26:30.797 --> 26:32.424
Are you crazy? Just look at me.

26:32.424 --> 26:33.925
Just look at me and just stop it.

26:33.925 --> 26:36.219
- Hey, just look at me.
- Get off me! Don't touch me!

26:36.219 --> 26:37.929
- No!
- Just...

26:38.471 --> 26:39.514
Hey.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.767
Hey. You know me.

26:43.226 --> 26:44.394
You know me.

26:47.272 --> 26:50.191
- You know me.
- I don't fucking know you!

26:50.191 --> 26:51.443
Get the fuck off of me!

26:53.903 --> 26:55.697
Hey, little girl. Hey.

26:56.489 --> 26:58.033
Hi, sweetie. We're gonna...

26:58.158 --> 26:59.618
We're gonna go on a little trip.

27:00.201 --> 27:02.537
I know. Are you a sleepyhead? Come here.

27:03.705 --> 27:04.998
Come here. I got ya.

27:05.915 --> 27:07.042
I know.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.044
Please, please, please.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.670
Please. I'm sorry.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.215
I'm sorry.

27:17.093 --> 27:18.470
For what, Steve?

28:14.401 --> 28:15.610
- Irene?
- <i>Hello.</i>

28:15.610 --> 28:18.488
<i>I'm looking for Steve Banerjee.</i>

28:19.948 --> 28:21.074
Who is this?

28:21.241 --> 28:22.409
<i>This is Scott Garriola.</i>

28:22.867 --> 28:24.619
<i>I'm a special agent with the FBI.</i>

28:30.875 --> 28:32.377
Your name is Somen.

28:34.003 --> 28:35.213
My birth name. Yes.

28:37.173 --> 28:38.216
That's funny.

28:39.926 --> 28:41.136
Why is it funny?

28:41.136 --> 28:43.805
You know, it's Somen,

28:44.639 --> 28:47.475
and you show men.

28:48.017 --> 28:49.018
That's...

28:50.019 --> 28:52.105
I mean... You never...

28:54.649 --> 28:55.859
Okay.

28:59.154 --> 29:00.321
May I ask why I'm here?

29:02.282 --> 29:06.119
- Yeah, well, as I'm sure you're aware...
- Nick De Noia was murdered.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.287
Yes.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.414
I hope to God you catch
whoever is responsible.

29:10.290 --> 29:11.416
You and me both.

29:12.667 --> 29:14.169
Unfortunately, I have no information

29:14.169 --> 29:16.254
that will help you
in your investigation.

29:20.175 --> 29:21.801
So how long were you and Nick partners?

29:21.801 --> 29:23.178
We were not partners.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.264
- No?
- I was his boss.

29:26.973 --> 29:28.558
Oh.

29:28.975 --> 29:31.352
How long were you his boss?

29:32.896 --> 29:33.980
About seven years.

29:34.147 --> 29:36.232
- That's a long time.
- Yes, it is.

29:36.232 --> 29:38.526
How would you
characterize your relationship?

29:38.526 --> 29:39.778
Characterize it?

29:39.778 --> 29:42.572
Yeah. Was it good?

29:42.697 --> 29:43.948
Was it bad?

29:43.948 --> 29:46.242
Did you fight much?

29:47.410 --> 29:48.995
We had the occasional disagreement.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.205
Hmm-mmm?

29:50.205 --> 29:52.707
But no more
than a typical work relationship.

29:54.459 --> 29:55.794
Huh.

29:59.005 --> 30:01.299
May I ask why the FBI is involved?

30:02.509 --> 30:05.887
I would think this would fall under
the auspices of New York City police.

30:07.430 --> 30:11.017
Yes. So, Chippendales is considered

30:11.017 --> 30:13.686
interstate commerce
because you have the clubs

30:14.145 --> 30:16.105
and the tour, which,

30:17.190 --> 30:19.317
you know, it kicks it upstairs to us.

30:21.277 --> 30:23.029
I did not realize that's how it works.

30:24.614 --> 30:25.698
That's how it works.

30:27.242 --> 30:29.661
But yeah,
we are working closely with them on it.

30:33.289 --> 30:35.416
Anyway, um...

30:35.416 --> 30:38.044
So what kind of things
did you two fight about?

30:39.504 --> 30:40.922
Boring work things,

30:40.922 --> 30:43.007
- you know...
- Please just answer the question.

30:44.259 --> 30:45.385
Am I a suspect?

30:47.470 --> 30:50.056
- I didn't say that. Did I?
- You're treating me like a suspect.

30:50.056 --> 30:52.767
I'm just gathering information,
just getting context.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.018
Context.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.730
And Nick, he controlled
the touring rights, right?

30:57.730 --> 31:00.024
- He did.
- And that was going pretty well.

31:00.191 --> 31:03.152
You know, the tour is one of our
most profitable revenue streams.

31:03.570 --> 31:07.615
Yeah. Did that bother you that he had
such a lucrative part of the company?

31:08.199 --> 31:10.618
- Not at all.
- Actually, maybe the most lucrative.

31:12.996 --> 31:14.205
I have 50% stake in it.

31:14.205 --> 31:15.999
I was thrilled with its performance.

31:15.999 --> 31:18.042
Now, your failed club...

31:18.751 --> 31:20.169
There were issues over the years.

31:21.462 --> 31:22.589
Issues?

31:22.589 --> 31:26.259
Yeah. Overcrowding, fines,
all sorts of trouble with the city.

31:26.259 --> 31:28.344
Any club in LA has things like this.

31:28.344 --> 31:30.221
And then, of course, the lawsuit, right?

31:30.221 --> 31:33.057
You kept Black people out of your club.

31:34.601 --> 31:35.727
- Okay...
- And Hispanics

31:35.727 --> 31:36.978
- or gays...
- That is not...

31:36.978 --> 31:39.355
- Or anybody else...
- You are not understanding...

31:39.355 --> 31:40.982
...that you found undesirable.

31:40.982 --> 31:43.359
- That is an...
- Question. Did you let Indians in?

31:43.359 --> 31:45.069
What's this have to do with the murder?

31:45.069 --> 31:46.863
I don't know. It seems like a pattern.

31:47.989 --> 31:48.990
A pattern?

31:49.407 --> 31:50.867
A contempt for authority.

31:51.576 --> 31:55.455
A certain disregard for the law.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.708
If you think blocked fire exits
has anything to do with...

31:58.708 --> 31:59.834
Hey, take it easy.

32:01.669 --> 32:02.837
Just take it easy.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.049
This is your society.

32:07.800 --> 32:08.885
I beg your pardon?

32:10.637 --> 32:11.721
You made these rules.

32:12.221 --> 32:14.474
You made it so that some people
are born at the bottom.

32:14.724 --> 32:16.517
Why is it my job to come fix it?

32:17.268 --> 32:20.063
I just wanted a successful business
for me and my family.

32:20.563 --> 32:22.899
You put people like me at the bottom.

32:24.150 --> 32:26.319
You made fun of the name
that my father gave me.

32:29.447 --> 32:31.157
You made it so difficult for me.

32:32.533 --> 32:33.618
And still, I made it.

32:35.620 --> 32:39.415
I have everything, and I regret nothing.

32:42.710 --> 32:43.795
<i>He's guilty.</i>

32:44.170 --> 32:45.964
- 100%.
- Sure as hell seems that way.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.007
Just one problem.
There's no hard evidence.

33:04.649 --> 33:08.319
We'll just keep digging
and then hopefully something turns up.

33:09.028 --> 33:12.740
- And if not?
- Then he gets away with murder.
