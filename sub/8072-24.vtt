WEBVTT

00:04.338 --> 00:08.176
[music playing]

00:18.652 --> 00:19.687
Yes, slide, man.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.521
Slide.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.960
So who's winning,
Morticia or Gomez?

00:26.994 --> 00:29.597
I'm watching the TV
to look for job ideas.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.200
So far I've got it narrowed
down to weatherman,

00:32.233 --> 00:38.139
spokes model, time life
operator, psychic friend.

00:38.172 --> 00:42.810
And the one I think I got
the best shot at, cast away.

00:42.843 --> 00:46.247
Yeah, so do you have any
non-fictional possibilities?

00:46.280 --> 00:48.216
I have an interview today
at the community center

00:48.249 --> 00:50.184
to be activities director.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.319
Good pay, great hours.

00:51.352 --> 00:53.521
And best of all, I
get to wear a whistle.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.656
Yeah, but doesn't
an activities director

00:55.689 --> 00:59.026
have to be, you know, active.

00:59.059 --> 01:03.531
Oh, contrair, that's what
the assistant activities

01:03.564 --> 01:04.965
director is for.

01:04.998 --> 01:08.569
And they said you weren't
management material.

01:08.602 --> 01:09.570
Mom.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.205
- What happened?
- I don't know.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.873
I went out for a pass
and when I turned around,

01:12.906 --> 01:14.808
he had fallen off the curb.

01:14.842 --> 01:15.809
It's really bad.

01:15.843 --> 01:18.579
I can see right
through the bone.

01:18.612 --> 01:19.480
Look how white it is.

01:19.513 --> 01:22.216
No, that's just your skin, DJ.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.617
You need to wear
shorts more often.

01:26.154 --> 01:27.521
It really, really hurts.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.990
Well, we're going to send your
dad out to find that nasty curb

01:30.023 --> 01:31.024
that did this to you.

01:31.058 --> 01:33.794
Here, put your leg up here.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.196
Hurry, it's
starting to puff up.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.965
Oh, I'll get the ice.

01:37.998 --> 01:39.800
Oh my god, are you all right?

01:39.833 --> 01:41.735
Oh, oh.

01:41.769 --> 01:42.703
Oh.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.605
Oh my god, it's your tooth.

01:44.638 --> 01:47.575
Cool, can I have it?

01:47.608 --> 01:51.044
[laughing]

01:51.078 --> 01:55.449
[music playing]

02:42.730 --> 02:45.165
We did it.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.635
We finally did it.

02:47.668 --> 02:51.639
You're not going to, like,
high five me, are you?

02:51.672 --> 02:54.608
Sorry, I'm just excited.

02:54.642 --> 02:57.211
It was incredible, wasn't it?

02:57.245 --> 02:59.046
Well, I don't have
anything to compare it to,

02:59.079 --> 03:00.314
but I think we did pretty good.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.223
Did you hear that?

03:09.257 --> 03:10.691
What?

03:10.724 --> 03:12.593
My parents are home.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.362
Oh god, this is bad.

03:14.395 --> 03:19.166
Well, look at it this way, at
least you won't die a virgin.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.234
Where are my pants?

03:20.268 --> 03:21.569
What did you do with my pants?

03:21.602 --> 03:24.438
I ate them in the
throes of passion.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.373
I got to pants.

03:25.406 --> 03:29.076
The first clue to
sex is no pants.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.478
Here, hurry up.

03:37.084 --> 03:38.051
False alarm.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.387
Oh.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.322
That is the last time we do
that without our clothes on.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.495
Hey, Darlene, I have
a surprise for you.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.897
Already?

03:49.930 --> 03:51.365
No.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.233
I went down to our
post-office box

03:53.267 --> 03:55.803
and our letters from
the art school came.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.070
New York or Chicago?

03:57.104 --> 03:58.939
Both.

03:58.972 --> 03:59.840
We'll open them together.

03:59.873 --> 04:00.674
New York first.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.682
Dear Miss Conner, thank
you for your interest

04:08.716 --> 04:13.020
in the New York College of
Creative Arts, unfortunately--

04:16.757 --> 04:18.492
Sorry, Darlene.

04:18.526 --> 04:22.229
Why couldn't they just
write, dear loser, drop dead.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.499
Dear loser--

04:25.533 --> 04:26.700
Well, New York thinks we suck.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.544
Chicago agrees with New York.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.953
Well, it's official,
we're both talentless hacks

04:45.986 --> 04:48.922
who will spend the rest
of our lives in Lanford.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.958
Let's party.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.626
I'm so depressed.

04:52.660 --> 04:53.461
Me too.

04:56.664 --> 05:02.302
Do you want to, you
know, do it again.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.940
Just for future
reference, you never

05:06.974 --> 05:10.010
have to ask that question.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.980
[laughing]

05:13.013 --> 05:16.884
[music playing]

05:19.453 --> 05:22.022
Oh, Dan, would you please
go to your job interview.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.524
You're driving me nuts.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.258
Well, I just want
to be here for you.

05:25.292 --> 05:27.795
Look, Dan, we both
wish you hadn't slammed

05:27.828 --> 05:30.731
the door into my face causing
me major and unbelievable pain.

05:30.764 --> 05:35.068
But you've just got to put
it behind you like I have.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.004
- You get your new tooth?
- Uh huh.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.206
Thank god you got that fixed
because I got to tell you,

05:39.239 --> 05:41.675
that was starting
to gross me out.

05:41.709 --> 05:42.876
So you want see it?

05:42.910 --> 05:43.677
Yeah.

05:49.383 --> 05:50.350
Why didn't you get it fixed?

05:50.384 --> 05:51.452
No insurance.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.554
A new tooth would have
set us back $1,500.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.055
Well, you can go
to a dental college,

05:55.088 --> 05:56.457
have a student work on it.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.426
Yeah, but with my luck,
I'd get somebody who's there

05:58.459 --> 06:01.128
on a football scholarship.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.696
Fine, put a chiclet in there.

06:02.730 --> 06:06.133
I'm just trying to help.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.201
I better go.

06:08.235 --> 06:11.505
All right, now remember,
Dan, when you meet the boss,

06:11.539 --> 06:14.207
head high, shoulders
back, lips on butt.

06:16.977 --> 06:21.348
That's right, I was doing
lips back, butt on shoulders.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.856
Well, well, well.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.295
Roseanne running a restaurant.
What next?

06:35.328 --> 06:36.129
Me in the army?

06:44.371 --> 06:47.575
Leon, the boss from hell.

06:47.608 --> 06:50.844
You know, the last time I saw
you you were stealing my tips

06:50.878 --> 06:54.682
to pay for that hair weave.

06:54.715 --> 06:57.050
Last time I saw you, you
were standing there leaning

06:57.084 --> 07:00.020
on the counter doing nothing
but sucking up the oxygen.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.722
Boom, deja vu.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.994
Well, I see you finally
saved up enough for a part.

07:09.897 --> 07:12.199
Now wait a minute,
something is different here.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.501
Have you lost weight?

07:13.534 --> 07:14.334
No.

07:16.704 --> 07:17.505
You've lost teeth.

07:21.809 --> 07:25.078
Bumpkin works for you.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.147
So what, Leon, are you
here looking for a job?

07:27.180 --> 07:28.916
Because I'm sorry,
we have no openings

07:28.949 --> 07:32.786
for useless corporate suckups.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.623
That's very funny coming
from a Jack-o-lantern.

07:38.526 --> 07:39.827
But for your
information, Roseanne,

07:39.860 --> 07:45.866
I'm already employed
as a health inspector.

07:45.899 --> 07:49.036
You are jerking me, right?

07:49.069 --> 07:51.071
Oh, how I have
missed that special way

07:51.104 --> 07:54.842
you have of sidestepping
the English language.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.777
You know, I asked for this
assignment specifically,

07:56.810 --> 07:57.911
Roseanne.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.580
But at first, you know,
I was a little worried

07:59.613 --> 08:02.916
that my memory of your
slovenly habits and your room

08:02.950 --> 08:06.419
temperature IQ might bias me.

08:06.453 --> 08:10.323
But then I thought, cool.

08:10.357 --> 08:12.660
I tell you what, Roseanne,
I'll give you 10 seconds

08:12.693 --> 08:14.928
to run around and sweep
up the roach droppings

08:14.962 --> 08:16.396
into neat and manageable piles.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.869
So Leon, have we ordered yet?

08:21.902 --> 08:23.136
No.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.872
Two lose meats, please.

08:24.905 --> 08:27.775
This is my supervisor, Jeffery.

08:27.808 --> 08:31.645
So Leon, what did you
have to do to get this job?

08:31.679 --> 08:34.114
Just shut up.

08:34.147 --> 08:35.315
Don't say anything.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.551
You never let me say anything.

08:37.585 --> 08:40.888
Am I smothering you again?

08:40.921 --> 08:43.791
[laughing]

08:43.824 --> 08:44.625
Oh my god.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.663
What are you ashamed
of, we're in love.

08:54.768 --> 08:57.437
Just stop speaking, Jeffrey.

08:57.470 --> 09:00.073
Well, so listen, junior,
you scratch my back

09:00.107 --> 09:03.877
and I won't tell who's
scratching yours.

09:03.911 --> 09:06.246
You got a deal.

09:06.279 --> 09:10.350
So, how'd you lose
the tooth, Roseanne?

09:10.383 --> 09:12.552
Darndest thing,
sitting here this morning

09:12.586 --> 09:13.921
making up the meat, you know.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.889
And it just popped out.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.626
It's got to be in
here somewhere.

09:18.659 --> 09:22.095
[laughing]

09:22.129 --> 09:26.466
[music playing]

09:31.538 --> 09:33.607
Jackie, can I talk
to you for a sec?

09:33.641 --> 09:34.975
Sure.

09:35.008 --> 09:40.547
You know, sooner or later
they all come to Jack's.

09:40.580 --> 09:44.051
That's cause you're so
young and hip you get us kids.

09:44.084 --> 09:48.956
Well, I do speak the
language of today's youth.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.090
Never mind.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.558
No, come on.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.459
Come back.

09:52.492 --> 09:53.627
I want to help.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.228
OK.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.530
David and I both applied
in the Chicago art school

09:57.564 --> 09:58.899
for next semester.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.600
I sent a bunch of
my short stories

10:00.634 --> 10:04.337
and he sent a bunch
of his drawings.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.472
You got accepted.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.378
What am I missing?

10:11.411 --> 10:12.646
David didn't get in.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.848
Oh god.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.216
How's he taking it?

10:16.249 --> 10:18.385
He doesn't know.
Nobody knows.

10:18.418 --> 10:21.054
Nobody.

10:21.088 --> 10:24.224
Wow, what are you
going to say to her?

10:24.257 --> 10:26.259
I was thinking of
something like, mom,

10:26.293 --> 10:28.228
Jackie wants to talk to you.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.597
No, Darlene, no, no.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.564
Not me.

10:31.598 --> 10:32.966
Please, Jackie.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.835
I was going to run away but I
don't need Rose-illa leveling

10:34.868 --> 10:38.471
Chicago trying to find me.

10:38.505 --> 10:39.606
Darlene--

10:39.639 --> 10:40.774
I wouldn't ask
this of you if it

10:40.808 --> 10:44.411
wasn't a really big deal to me.

10:44.444 --> 10:47.915
All right, I'll do it.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.283
But when you're a
famous writer, I

10:50.317 --> 10:51.819
want you to dedicate
your first novel

10:51.852 --> 10:55.989
to your incredibly brave aunt
Jackie, whose brutal death made

10:56.023 --> 10:57.224
this book possible.

10:57.257 --> 11:01.561
[laughing]

11:01.594 --> 11:04.865
[music playing]

11:05.999 --> 11:08.101
Hey, Jackie, check
out my new mouth.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.002
You got your new tooth?

11:09.036 --> 11:10.738
Oh, it looks great, Roseanne.

11:10.771 --> 11:14.441
Yeah, I figured white
goes with everything.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.944
Do you think it's
too white, though?

11:16.977 --> 11:18.846
Oh, maybe I won't brush
it for a couple days

11:18.879 --> 11:19.980
till it matches the other one.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.484
We should celebrate.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.186
Let's eat some solids.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.855
Oh.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.957
Yeah, she's back.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.893
Maybe some nacho-- no, no,
no, right for the potato

11:32.926 --> 11:34.194
chips there.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.696
All right, drum roll please.

11:39.399 --> 11:40.333
Yes.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.069
Got any pop bottles
you need open?

11:42.102 --> 11:43.336
What's in the bag?

11:43.370 --> 11:46.106
No, no, no, no.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.475
Well, I was going to wait till
you moved into your own place

11:48.508 --> 11:51.879
but I stopped off on the way
and I got you these really cool

11:51.912 --> 11:53.080
wine glasses that you wanted.

11:53.113 --> 11:56.483
Oh, Roseanne, those
weren't even on sale.

11:56.516 --> 11:59.486
Yeah, I must've still been
real high from all the gas

11:59.519 --> 12:01.021
they gave me.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.655
How high are you?

12:02.689 --> 12:06.526
Because I sort of got some news.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.328
What?

12:08.361 --> 12:11.098
Put down the bag first.

12:11.131 --> 12:11.999
Why?

12:12.032 --> 12:13.600
- Roseanne.
- Why, Jackie?

12:13.633 --> 12:14.835
Why do I have to
put down the bag?

12:14.868 --> 12:17.104
Because there's something
that I have to tell you,

12:17.137 --> 12:20.941
which although it may not
sound like it, is good news.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.376
It's really, really good.
- Uh huh.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.847
But there is a chance that
just for a split second,

12:26.880 --> 12:28.782
you might not find
the news good.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.951
So please put down the bag.

12:34.721 --> 12:37.958
Darlene got accepted
into this really great

12:37.991 --> 12:41.829
writing program at an art school
in Chicago and she wants to go.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.168
Take a deep breath
and count to 10.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.803
I can't count to 10.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.471
My head's going to explode at 6.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.640
Then try and be reasonable.

12:53.673 --> 12:54.875
No, I'm not going
to be reasonable.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.343
She brought this up
to me two months ago

12:56.376 --> 12:58.578
and I told her there's no way
she's getting out of Lanford.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.713
Well, maybe you
should reconsider.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.515
OK, I'll reconsider.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.251
There's no way she's
getting out of her room.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.352
Oh great, Roseanne.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.786
Don't bother putting
any thought behind it.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.489
Just go blow up at her in your
own special, psychotic way.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.224
Don't tell me what to do.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.326
You can't go
screaming at Darlene.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.261
I sure can.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.795
If I don't start
screaming at her,

13:15.829 --> 13:18.866
then she won't have no idea
why she's getting strangled.

13:18.899 --> 13:23.170
[laughing]

13:29.142 --> 13:30.143
Darlene?

13:30.177 --> 13:31.244
Yeah.

13:31.278 --> 13:34.681
I told her and I think
it went pretty well.

13:34.714 --> 13:39.619
You might want to get
out of the house, now.

13:39.652 --> 13:44.024
[music playing]

13:47.094 --> 13:48.095
Roseanne, you up here?

13:51.031 --> 13:53.700
Did you talk to Darlene?

13:53.733 --> 13:56.436
She wasn't here.

13:56.469 --> 13:57.304
Oh, Roseanne.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.576
Jackie, why do all my kids
want to leave me so bad?

14:03.610 --> 14:06.179
No, don't cry.

14:06.213 --> 14:09.116
I'm a lousy mother,
aren't I, Jackie?

14:09.149 --> 14:11.484
No, you're a great mother.

14:11.518 --> 14:14.287
You're loving and protective.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.756
You're like one of
those mother lions

14:16.789 --> 14:19.659
in the nature films
that carries her babies

14:19.692 --> 14:21.694
around by the back of the neck.

14:21.728 --> 14:24.297
Except sometimes you
get a little rough

14:24.331 --> 14:26.033
and you rip their heads off.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.006
Darlene can't leave.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.009
I don't even got the
suitcases back from Becky yet.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.378
But this isn't like Becky.

14:38.411 --> 14:39.913
Darlene's not running
away from you.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.548
She's running toward something.

14:41.581 --> 14:44.051
She wants a better future.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.055
I guess so.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.668
I know it's rough.

15:01.701 --> 15:05.472
But you know, there's a lot
worse things than having

15:05.505 --> 15:07.340
your kids leave you.

15:07.374 --> 15:11.144
I suppose this is what mom
felt like when we moved out.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.446
I don't know, I'm
still living with her.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.718
I guess there
are worse things.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.053
Yeah.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.388
Yeah.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.289
Oh.

15:22.322 --> 15:23.656
Ew, you're grossing me out.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.493
Well, you rubbed
your nose on me.

15:26.526 --> 15:27.760
Well, don't try
to clean me up.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.562
I'm not even done crying.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.631
Look, you raised a great kid.

15:31.664 --> 15:34.801
She's talented and
smart and independent.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.370
One who could make
it on her own.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.239
Great.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.241
Tell me what I did wrong
so I don't do it again.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.222
Is it safe to come in?

15:55.255 --> 15:56.223
Safe as ever.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.557
She has agreed to
sit down and talk

15:57.590 --> 16:00.127
about it, which means we've
already won half the battle.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.295
Of course, the second half
is the real bloody, dangerous

16:02.329 --> 16:03.563
part.

16:03.596 --> 16:04.397
Roseanne?

16:10.303 --> 16:11.704
Hey.

16:11.738 --> 16:12.939
Hey.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.608
Darlene, would
you like to begin?

16:25.118 --> 16:26.386
I know you don't
want me to do this

16:26.419 --> 16:27.654
but it was a whole
different thing when

16:27.687 --> 16:28.821
we were talking about New York.

16:28.855 --> 16:31.291
Chicago is only
like two hours away.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.526
Yeah, that would be
a much quicker trip

16:33.560 --> 16:35.628
to identify the body.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.665
Your mother is now using
humor to help us through this

16:38.698 --> 16:40.100
and we thank her for that.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.805
I got a scholarship
for tuition

16:45.838 --> 16:47.674
and the school says I
could live at the dorm

16:47.707 --> 16:49.676
and work at the bookstore
to pay for meals and books.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.879
See how she's got everything
all figured out, Roseanne?

16:52.912 --> 16:56.516
And now, Darlene, your
mother will consider it.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.285
I'm sorry but
you're too young.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.887
The answer is no.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.756
I think you have a
little more considering

17:03.790 --> 17:07.094
time allotted to you.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.862
Jackie, you've been so very
helpful here in the kitchen.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.631
But you know, I think
you'd be even more

17:11.664 --> 17:13.966
useful standing out
in the front yard

17:14.000 --> 17:17.170
staring directly into the sun.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.971
Your mother is no
longer using humor.

17:19.005 --> 17:22.609
Now she's just being mean.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.211
Why do I even bother?

17:24.244 --> 17:26.346
Beats the hell out of me.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.715
You know, do you ever
think about my future?

17:28.748 --> 17:29.782
I don't get this.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.384
I thought parents
wanted their kids to be

17:31.418 --> 17:33.220
more successful than them.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.521
Well, of course
your father and I

17:34.554 --> 17:35.722
want you to do better than us.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.490
Why do you think we
spend our whole lives

17:37.524 --> 17:40.093
setting such a low standard?

17:40.127 --> 17:44.030
Look, I was really hoping
that you would understand

17:44.063 --> 17:45.165
how important this is to me.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.499
But to be honest,
it doesn't matter.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.135
I don't care what you
say, I'm going to Chicago

17:48.168 --> 17:49.302
whether you like it or not.

17:49.336 --> 17:51.304
Well good, you try
going to Chicago, Darlene,

17:51.338 --> 17:53.706
and I'll sick the cops on you.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.575
That is exactly what
I would expect from you.

17:58.645 --> 17:59.812
Can we talk about this later?

17:59.846 --> 18:01.914
No, let's talk
about it right now.

18:01.948 --> 18:02.949
What's going on?

18:02.982 --> 18:05.552
Oh, don't pretend
like you don't know.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.255
Mom takes Becky and
then you take Darlene.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.757
You got another Healy brother
coming over to take my stereo?

18:14.093 --> 18:14.894
What's she talking about?

18:18.698 --> 18:19.499
I got into Chicago.

18:22.502 --> 18:23.303
You lied to me?

18:26.739 --> 18:28.608
Perfect.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.810
I hope you have fun.

18:30.843 --> 18:31.644
David.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.354
I'm sorry l lied to you.

18:41.388 --> 18:42.889
So you sleep with me
and now you're leaving.

18:42.922 --> 18:45.625
What, were you just
using me for practice?

18:45.658 --> 18:46.959
Yeah, that's exactly it.

18:46.993 --> 18:48.528
I think I'm ready for
the regionals now.

18:52.232 --> 18:55.034
You didn't even tell me.

18:55.067 --> 18:57.170
Well, I wasn't going
to go without you.

18:57.204 --> 18:59.639
Why don't you come with me
and reapply for next semester?

18:59.672 --> 19:00.973
Oh great idea, Darlene.

19:01.007 --> 19:04.143
What happens if I go down
there and I don't get in again?

19:04.177 --> 19:05.312
Well, at least
we'll be together.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.314
And I'll be meeting a
lot of important people.

19:07.347 --> 19:10.917
I'll be able to
introduce you to them.

19:10.950 --> 19:11.984
So what happens if I don't go?

19:12.018 --> 19:12.819
What are you going to do?

19:15.422 --> 19:16.756
This is like the
most important thing

19:16.789 --> 19:19.992
that's ever happened to me.

19:20.026 --> 19:23.095
I can't turn it down.

19:23.129 --> 19:25.832
Fine, you just
remember, you're

19:25.865 --> 19:27.367
leaving behind the
guy who encouraged

19:27.400 --> 19:28.701
you to go to art school.

19:28.735 --> 19:31.604
You're leaving behind the guy
you lost your virginity to.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.105
And you're leaving him
behind with the two

19:33.139 --> 19:34.374
huge, angry parents.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.056
Hey.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.224
Let me see it.

19:51.258 --> 19:52.459
Let me see that beautiful smile.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.264
Oh, you sure got a pretty mouth.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.601
How was dental college?

20:01.634 --> 20:02.735
Oh, it went so good.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.271
I don't think I got one
of the best students.

20:04.304 --> 20:08.808
He actually asked me which
one of my teeth was missing.

20:08.841 --> 20:11.944
Well, next time you
can go to a real dentist.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.614
Remember that kooky scheme I
had where I'd go out every day

20:14.647 --> 20:17.350
and perform work in
exchange for money?

20:17.384 --> 20:18.951
I pulled it off.

20:18.985 --> 20:21.388
I am so proud of you.

20:21.421 --> 20:25.325
My mom always wanted me to
marry an activities director.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.694
Show me your whistle.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.229
Later, if you're good.

20:30.263 --> 20:32.399
Ah, I didn't get that job.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.066
I got a job with the government.

20:34.100 --> 20:38.004
Cool, our government?

20:38.037 --> 20:41.541
Supervising guys fixing
trucks for the city.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.676
A job with the city?

20:43.710 --> 20:49.015
315 sick days a
year, plus flag day?

20:49.048 --> 20:51.484
Good pay, medical insurance.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.620
And the best part is,
since it's civil service,

20:53.653 --> 20:57.223
no matter how much I screw
up, they can't fire me.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.526
That a boy, Dan.

20:59.559 --> 21:02.061
But what about holding
out for your dream job?

21:02.094 --> 21:06.466
Honey, when I can't afford
to keep my wife in teeth,

21:06.499 --> 21:12.339
I know it's time to become
an adult. So how's it going?

21:12.372 --> 21:13.873
Well, actually--

21:13.906 --> 21:14.774
No.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.976
No.

21:17.009 --> 21:20.313
I don't want to hear
anything bad on my happy day.

21:20.347 --> 21:23.049
Well, Darlene got
accepted into this writing

21:23.082 --> 21:25.318
school over there in Chicago.

21:25.352 --> 21:27.720
But it's my happy day.

21:27.754 --> 21:30.923
And she said she is going
to go no matter what we say.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.224
Doesn't she know
it's my happy day.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.128
So I tell her
if she goes we're

21:36.162 --> 21:38.498
going to sick the cops on her.

21:38.531 --> 21:41.067
Oh man.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.835
This parenthood
thing doesn't look

21:42.869 --> 21:45.338
like it did in the brochures.
