WEBVTT

01:13.532 --> 01:14.783
It's gonna be great.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.535
Sure, what could go wrong?

01:16.535 --> 01:18.495
- She's gonna love you.
- Uh-huh.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.457
Do you think you'll see NYU
while you're in town?

01:24.168 --> 01:25.169
Maybe.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.129
She can't go to NYU.

01:27.129 --> 01:29.256
How would she be
home for dinner every night?

01:29.798 --> 01:31.466
Your dad told me you love theater,

01:31.466 --> 01:35.012
so I got us tickets to the revival of
Barefoot in the Park tomorrow.

01:36.430 --> 01:40.309
Neil Simon, right? He's a favorite
around here. How great is that?

01:42.603 --> 01:44.521
I thought it was
just gonna be us tomorrow.

01:47.191 --> 01:50.903
You know what? I'm pretty far behind
on that bowl for the Canners.

01:50.903 --> 01:52.779
I could use a quiet night at the studio.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.991
- You two go without me.
- No, I'd like us all to go together.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.285
Sure, we'll do it next time.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.958
Say thank you for the tickets.

02:06.752 --> 02:09.588
Thanks. I have to go to the bathroom.

02:16.386 --> 02:17.387
Yeah.

02:18.514 --> 02:19.765
It's gonna be great, huh?

02:21.808 --> 02:22.809
You're doing fine.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.145
I know exactly how I'm doing, thank you.

02:30.234 --> 02:32.486
- She seems great.
- You mean that?

02:32.486 --> 02:33.987
She's her own person.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.406
What could be better than that?

02:38.158 --> 02:39.159
Nothing.

02:41.370 --> 02:43.580
Why would he make up a fake life?

02:44.540 --> 02:48.502
I don't know.
Maybe he was trying to protect you.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.586
From what?

02:50.671 --> 02:51.839
I really don't know.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.926
- The only thing I know for certain--
- He lied to me.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.428
He lied to me too.

03:04.560 --> 03:09.314
So, I mean, if he changed his name,
that means he probably changed mine.

03:10.357 --> 03:11.692
Yeah.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.194
And my birthday.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.029
Probably.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.953
Seems like something a person should know
about themselves.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.464
- Bailey.
- What?

03:35.340 --> 03:36.800
What are you gonna say, Hannah?

03:37.634 --> 03:41.180
What the fuck could you possibly say
right now that would make any sense?

03:42.973 --> 03:45.809
Nothing. There's nothing to say.

03:50.772 --> 03:54.985
We should try and get some sleep.
We've got an early flight home.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.279
Excuse me?

03:58.030 --> 03:59.281
We're not gonna find him there.

04:04.703 --> 04:05.704
You were right.

04:06.788 --> 04:10.375
Something's here. I can feel it.

04:13.837 --> 04:14.838
So, you wanna stay?

04:18.257 --> 04:20.677
Yeah. I wanna stay.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.447
<i>You should've seen me at 15.</i>

04:40.948 --> 04:42.366
What color was your hair?

04:42.366 --> 04:46.453
Seriously, it wasn't pretty.
It's not easy without a mom.

04:52.876 --> 04:55.045
Thank God I had my grandfather.

04:55.838 --> 04:57.089
Yeah.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.076
Deputy Bradford's office.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.244
Yes. Is he in?

05:27.244 --> 05:29.705
<i>I'm afraid he's on vacation.
Would you like his voice mail?</i>

05:30.747 --> 05:31.790
Vacation?

05:31.790 --> 05:32.875
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

05:33.750 --> 05:35.127
Can I take a message?

05:35.627 --> 05:39.089
No, but you can put me in touch with
someone who can tell me

05:39.089 --> 05:42.676
what Deputy Bradford was doing waving
his badge in my face on his vacation.

05:45.596 --> 05:48.599
- Did you go see the Warriors?
- No, it wasn't that kind of trip, mijo.

05:48.599 --> 05:51.351
But I did catch the end of
last night's game on TV.

05:51.852 --> 05:55.314
- You see DeRozan dunk on Curry?
- Yeah. That was pretty.

05:55.314 --> 05:56.857
Hey, what were you doing up so late?

05:57.858 --> 05:59.651
- Dad!
- Buddy, it was a school night.

05:59.651 --> 06:00.736
We talked about this, okay?

06:01.445 --> 06:03.947
Come on, Dad. It's the playoffs.

06:06.033 --> 06:09.578
Okay, we're not done here.

06:14.541 --> 06:15.375
This is Grady.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.543
How's spring break?

06:17.044 --> 06:17.961
<i>Excuse me?</i>

06:17.961 --> 06:20.797
Your office just told me
you were on vacation. It's funny.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.050
It sure didn't seem that way
when you were sitting on my dock.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.553
Hannah, I was there to help.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.597
<i>Then how about telling me
what's really going on?</i>

06:28.597 --> 06:32.267
Why are there no records of Owen
before he and Bailey moved to Sausalito?

06:32.851 --> 06:34.728
<i>What? Who told you that?</i>

06:34.728 --> 06:36.146
What does that matter?

06:36.146 --> 06:38.941
<i>Look, did it ever occur to you that
the man developing The Shop's software</i>

06:38.941 --> 06:41.485
<i>for erasing online paper trails
may have used it on himself?</i>

06:43.862 --> 06:46.865
If that software works,
Avett wouldn't be on trial for fraud.

06:46.865 --> 06:49.284
And I would still be asleep
in bed with Owen,

06:49.284 --> 06:52.454
unaware that he'd lied to me
about everything, apparently.

06:52.454 --> 06:53.580
That's not actually true.

06:53.580 --> 06:56.708
Is that right?
Why did Owen change his name?

06:58.585 --> 07:00.254
I think you're getting ahead of
yourself there.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.047
<i>I think you're not telling me
the whole story.</i>

07:02.047 --> 07:05.092
I'm just trying to keep Owen safe.
Owen and Bailey. And you.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.427
Well,
I can take care of myself, thank you.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.304
<i>Is that what you're doing now?</i>

07:10.973 --> 07:13.058
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Where are you?

07:14.434 --> 07:15.769
<i>Hannah?</i>

07:16.436 --> 07:17.437
I'm home.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.273
Yeah, if that were the case
the heavy Avett sent over

07:19.273 --> 07:21.900
to break into your house
would have been more disturbing.

07:21.900 --> 07:24.027
What? Avett sent someone to--

07:24.027 --> 07:27.114
Seriously, where are you? A hotel?

07:27.114 --> 07:29.658
I'll send a deputy from
the San Francisco office to pick you up.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.452
Have you been watching my house?

07:33.078 --> 07:34.621
Where the hell are you, Hannah?

07:34.621 --> 07:35.998
Where are you worried I'll be?

07:43.672 --> 07:45.966
<i>It seems like something
a person should know.</i>

07:45.966 --> 07:48.260
She doesn't know what grade I'm in.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.373
Hannah.

08:21.502 --> 08:22.836
What the hell happened here?

08:23.587 --> 08:25.714
She doesn't even know what grade I'm in.

08:30.761 --> 08:31.762
Let me see.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.813
You didn't have to blame my bowl.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.568
Come on. You owe me a new one.

08:55.369 --> 08:56.662
All right, that's better.

08:57.329 --> 08:59.540
- I can't get it.
- Are you quitting on me?

08:59.540 --> 09:01.500
It's all marked up. There's no way
I'll scrape those out.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.126
So? It's for the cupboard, not a museum.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.462
You don't have to pretend.
We both know that it's a piece of shit.

09:05.462 --> 09:09.466
Hey. It's easy enough
to look at what went wrong.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.094
You know, you should try to take a second,

09:12.094 --> 09:14.471
look a little harder
and find the things to appreciate.

09:16.515 --> 09:20.185
So because my mom doesn't know
what grade I'm in,

09:20.185 --> 09:23.063
I should appreciate
that she knows how to spell my name right?

09:23.689 --> 09:24.773
- Got it.
- Hannah.

09:24.773 --> 09:25.858
No. I'm done.

09:28.652 --> 09:29.653
Hannah.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.492
<i>That's your choice
what you pay attention to.</i>

10:15.782 --> 10:19.536
Hey. What was the name of that restaurant
where your dad worked as a valet?

10:19.536 --> 10:22.456
Remember his story about getting fired
for scratching someone's Porsche?

10:24.583 --> 10:25.876
Sure. Yeah.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.294
You think he made that up?

10:28.587 --> 10:29.922
I mean, he was pretty specific.

10:29.922 --> 10:33.800
Exactly. All these stories your dad
loved to tell about when he was younger,

10:33.800 --> 10:35.219
they can't all be made up.

10:35.219 --> 10:37.221
Some of the details have to be true.

10:37.221 --> 10:40.140
Like the name of that restaurant.
If we could remember, we could look it up.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.808
Try and find people who knew him.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.771
Does this make any sense? You're looking
at me like I'm a crazy person.

10:46.605 --> 10:48.941
No. Yeah, I get it. I just--

10:50.067 --> 10:51.527
I don't remember the restaurant.

10:51.527 --> 10:53.987
Okay.
What about that high school boat trip?

10:53.987 --> 10:56.281
The one where he said he got rescued by
the Coast Guard?

10:57.074 --> 10:58.825
I don't think he told me that one.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.702
Right.
I wouldn't have told you that, either.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.330
Well, now I really wanna hear it.

11:04.540 --> 11:06.917
Wait. What about
that math professor at Princeton?

11:06.917 --> 11:10.045
The one he brings up
when he's lecturing me about persistence.

11:10.671 --> 11:13.131
Yeah. Dad failed his exam
and the guy framed it.

11:13.131 --> 11:14.883
As a warning for the rest of the class.

11:14.883 --> 11:17.636
Yeah. And Dad loves to tell me about how
that only motivated him,

11:17.636 --> 11:19.263
which is kind of messed up.

11:19.263 --> 11:20.973
Yeah. He loved that professor.
What was his name?

11:23.058 --> 11:23.976
Tobias something.

11:23.976 --> 11:28.313
Tobias Cocher? Cooker?

11:28.313 --> 11:30.315
Cookman. He called him Cook.

11:30.315 --> 11:33.986
How many math professors can there be
out there named Tobias Cookman?

11:35.946 --> 11:37.239
I see only one.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.032
What's a Fields Medal?

11:39.032 --> 11:42.327
It's like the Nobel Prize for math.
Is he at Princeton?

11:42.327 --> 11:43.704
Not exactly.

11:49.543 --> 11:50.544
Get dressed.

11:59.303 --> 12:00.137
Hey.

12:00.137 --> 12:02.472
Hey, how are you guys holding up?

12:03.140 --> 12:06.476
- I'm gonna say "no comment".
- Fair enough.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.020
What's going on?

12:08.020 --> 12:11.940
<i>Well, Jake is arguing with the barista
over the milk texture of his latte.</i>

12:11.940 --> 12:15.068
And I'm wondering if Owen kept
any kind of safe in the house.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.070
Safe?

12:17.070 --> 12:18.947
<i>Yeah, the Lady Paul piggy bank.</i>

12:18.947 --> 12:23.160
It had a small Honeywell key inside.
Jake said it's for a fireproof safe.

12:24.620 --> 12:26.038
A secret safe?

12:26.914 --> 12:28.457
Any idea where it might be?

12:28.457 --> 12:32.461
I don't know.
His office or the bedroom closet.

12:32.461 --> 12:35.047
Okay, got it. Anything else I can do?

12:36.340 --> 12:38.717
Yeah, actually. Can Jake hear me?

12:40.427 --> 12:41.553
Nope.

12:41.553 --> 12:45.474
Good. Under my bed there is a duffel.
Could you grab it, please?

12:45.474 --> 12:46.892
<i>Yeah. What's inside?</i>

12:47.643 --> 12:49.478
I'm not sure you wanna know.

12:53.440 --> 12:57.277
Hannah Hall. She's traveling with
her stepdaughter, Bailey Michaels, 16.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.572
They were last seen at home
in Sausalito 36 hours ago.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.866
But all signs point to them skipping town.

13:03.450 --> 13:04.493
Her truck's outside her house.

13:04.493 --> 13:07.871
So, rental car, bus fare, train ticket,
plane ticket, you know the drill.

13:07.871 --> 13:11.875
Track her credit cards,
ATM withdrawals, her boot prints, okay?

13:11.875 --> 13:13.043
We need her location ASAP.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.339
- Rochelle?
- Boss wants to see you.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.383
"Hi, Grady. You're back early.
How was your vacation?"

13:19.383 --> 13:20.676
She sounded pissed.

13:32.604 --> 13:35.899
Who's Hannah Hall? And what the hell
were you doing in Sausalito?

13:40.779 --> 13:41.947
I was coming to talk about that.

13:42.614 --> 13:44.199
You know lying to me is a felony.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.326
Lying about my vacation?

13:49.246 --> 13:50.247
Speak.

14:16.857 --> 14:17.858
Bailey.

14:25.741 --> 14:27.993
How many medals did this guy win?

14:27.993 --> 14:29.203
Apparently all of them.

14:32.748 --> 14:37.419
Hi. We're hoping to talk
with Professor Cookman.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.379
Do you have an appointment?

14:39.379 --> 14:41.924
- My father's a former student.
- We're happy to wait.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.384
Well, you're gonna have to
wait somewhere else

14:44.384 --> 14:48.472
'cause his next avail's on the 24th.

14:48.472 --> 14:49.848
That's two weeks from now.

14:51.517 --> 14:54.394
I'm Hannah, by the way. This is Bailey.
What's your name?

14:55.062 --> 14:56.188
Cheryl.

14:56.188 --> 14:58.398
Hi, Cheryl. Thanks for taking time.

14:59.066 --> 15:04.905
Especially because Bailey here is one of
the top mathletes in Corpus Christi

15:04.905 --> 15:08.116
and she's torn between going to UT
like her dad and Rice, like her sister.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.243
You see the issue,

15:09.243 --> 15:13.539
if we leave here without seeing
Cook and I lose another child to Rice...

15:16.208 --> 15:20.003
If there's anything you can do to help us
just have a little time with him today.

15:28.846 --> 15:30.180
Cook's teaching right now,

15:30.180 --> 15:33.267
but if you wait outside of class,
you may be able to catch him.

15:33.267 --> 15:35.894
Just don't interrupt him
or make any noise.

15:36.395 --> 15:37.938
Got it. Thank you so much.

15:42.860 --> 15:44.611
A mathlete? Seriously?

15:45.153 --> 15:46.947
Is that your way of
saying you're impressed?

16:09.386 --> 16:11.096
Bailey, wait. We should wait.

16:11.597 --> 16:12.598
Fuck Cheryl.

16:13.182 --> 16:17.436
This matrix, interestingly enough,
iteration of this matrix

16:17.436 --> 16:19.313
- applied to any non-zero vector--
- There's two seats.

16:24.318 --> 16:25.319
Sorry.

16:27.529 --> 16:29.573
I'm sure half of you
have lost your train of thought

16:29.573 --> 16:32.201
and the other half probably
weren't following to begin with,

16:32.201 --> 16:34.161
so let's call it a day, shall we?

16:41.835 --> 16:44.171
So sorry. Excuse us.

16:49.301 --> 16:50.928
Do you make a habit of
interrupting lectures

16:50.928 --> 16:52.679
or should I consider myself special?

16:53.472 --> 16:57.518
I'm so sorry, we didn't me--
I'm Hannah Hall. This is Bailey Michaels.

16:57.518 --> 16:58.435
What is it you want?

16:58.435 --> 17:01.230
We're hoping you can help us
identify a former student.

17:01.230 --> 17:03.857
And why would I do that
after you disrupted my class?

17:03.857 --> 17:05.526
You may be the only one who can.

17:10.113 --> 17:11.114
Who's the student?

17:12.115 --> 17:15.618
This is the oldest photo I have with me.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.497
He would've taken your class
about 26 years ago.

17:18.497 --> 17:20.332
We're hoping you can remember his name.

17:21.666 --> 17:24.837
You know he took my class 26 years ago
and you don't know his name?

17:24.837 --> 17:28.924
We know what his name is now,
but he changed it. It's complicated.

17:28.924 --> 17:30.551
- In a sentence.
- He's my dad.

17:31.677 --> 17:32.803
And he's missing.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.599
- How'd you trace him back to me?
- He's talked about you.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.143
Apparently you were
his favorite professor.

17:41.645 --> 17:43.272
As nice as that is,

17:43.272 --> 17:46.483
I can't say I recognize him.
I've had thousands of students.

17:46.483 --> 17:49.069
I'm afraid most of them
just tend to blur together.

17:50.779 --> 17:53.198
It would've been
your first or second year teaching.

17:55.701 --> 17:58.078
I don't know about your memory, Ms. Hall,

17:58.078 --> 18:01.123
but I find the further back I go,
the less I remember.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.625
Perhaps you should try
the registrar's office.

18:05.544 --> 18:07.171
He was the worst student you ever had.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.923
That's what you told him
when he flunked his midterm.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.967
You actually framed it, his exam.

18:11.967 --> 18:15.762
You hung it in your office as an example
for other students of what not to do.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.431
Which was cruel, by the way.

18:18.015 --> 18:21.518
But my husband, instead of hating you,
saw it as a challenge.

18:22.144 --> 18:23.520
And then he aced the final.

18:30.485 --> 18:32.070
- May I see that photograph again?
- Yeah.

18:37.993 --> 18:41.788
I can't tell you his name, but the face.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.416
He looks--

18:45.876 --> 18:49.505
He looks different in my recollection.
Although not entirely.

18:51.715 --> 18:52.758
You said he's missing?

18:55.260 --> 18:56.637
He worked at The Shop.

18:56.637 --> 18:59.848
He disappeared three days ago.
We haven't heard from him since.

19:01.767 --> 19:03.852
Come on.
Let's see if we can get you some answers.

19:14.279 --> 19:15.572
So...

19:16.823 --> 19:19.409
- Not our problem.
- You're kidding me.

19:19.409 --> 19:22.412
- Is Owen Michaels in West Texas?
- I sure as hell hope not.

19:22.412 --> 19:24.498
- Well, then.
- This isn't about where he is.

19:24.498 --> 19:27.000
It's about the fact that if this office
had done its job--

19:27.000 --> 19:30.045
Grady, you're not responsible
for the man's choices.

19:30.045 --> 19:31.421
And neither is this office.

19:31.421 --> 19:35.008
Okay. But if Naomi Wu starts
plastering Owen's face on the news--

19:35.008 --> 19:38.804
Then it'll be added incentive for him to
make better decisions than he did before.

19:38.804 --> 19:41.181
Although I think you've been
in this business long enough to know

19:41.181 --> 19:43.058
that people don't change.

19:43.851 --> 19:45.060
What about the girl?

19:45.060 --> 19:48.230
- All right, she's in serious danger.
- Not if she stays in Sausalito.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.731
You know the kind of people
we're dealing with.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.733
They catch wind of this,
it won't matter where she is.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.152
I guess her father
should've thought of that.

19:58.824 --> 20:00.576
Close the door on the way out.

20:15.257 --> 20:18.677
You'd think I'd remember his name,
having his test hung up like that.

20:19.928 --> 20:22.848
So, it's true? You really framed it?

20:24.516 --> 20:26.602
You have to understand,
I was young back then.

20:26.602 --> 20:31.398
Barely older than my students.
I thought it would assert my authority.

20:31.398 --> 20:32.941
Why did you take it down?

20:34.067 --> 20:36.653
When my wife saw it, she wasn't impressed.

20:36.653 --> 20:39.698
She thought it was in poor taste
to take a kid's failure

20:39.698 --> 20:41.450
and parade it like a prized deer.

20:42.034 --> 20:44.536
- Smart woman.
- Smarter than me, that's for sure.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.749
I found all your final exams
from the '90s.

20:48.749 --> 20:49.958
Thanks.

20:53.879 --> 20:57.216
I'm not sure those will be of much help.
We have blind grading here.

20:57.216 --> 20:58.342
There are no names.

20:58.342 --> 21:00.344
Is there a way to cross-check the numbers?

21:00.344 --> 21:04.014
Perhaps. Cheryl, check the filing cabinets
in the archives.

21:04.014 --> 21:05.516
See if there's a roster.

21:05.516 --> 21:09.394
And ask the registrar
for my class lists from '96 to '98.

21:09.394 --> 21:10.521
Okay.

21:13.398 --> 21:15.609
I still don't understand the name change.

21:15.609 --> 21:18.028
How does that fit into
the fraud allegations at his firm?

21:18.028 --> 21:19.821
That's what we're trying to figure out.

21:20.989 --> 21:24.826
He could've been in some kind of trouble
before The Shop. We don't know.

21:24.826 --> 21:29.122
We're only just learning the differences
between the things he told us and--

21:29.122 --> 21:30.290
The truth?

21:38.841 --> 21:42.386
I can't imagine
what you're going through right now,

21:42.386 --> 21:44.847
but for what it's worth,

21:44.847 --> 21:50.352
there's an old Einstein quote
that always calms me when I'm at a loss.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.353
Einstein?

21:52.771 --> 21:57.025
"So far as the theories
of mathematics are about reality,

21:57.776 --> 21:58.944
they are not certain.

21:59.570 --> 22:01.321
So far as they are certain,

22:02.364 --> 22:04.241
they are not about reality."

22:05.033 --> 22:06.702
Is there a version in English?

22:07.953 --> 22:09.746
Nobody knows shit about shit.

22:35.772 --> 22:36.773
Shit!

22:37.691 --> 22:38.942
How's it going in there?

22:45.324 --> 22:47.075
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

22:49.286 --> 22:50.287
But did Hannah call?

22:51.622 --> 22:52.873
Nope.

22:55.876 --> 22:57.961
Jules, do you know something
that I don't know?

22:58.462 --> 23:00.464
- No.
- Because I am her lawyer.

23:00.464 --> 23:01.632
I'm aware.

23:01.632 --> 23:03.133
Yeah, if there's something going on,

23:03.133 --> 23:05.677
if the FBI's about to drop a bomb
that I'm not aware of,

23:05.677 --> 23:09.181
- well, then I can't protect her.
- Okay. Calm down.

23:12.518 --> 23:15.312
Owen left Hannah and Bailey
a duffel bag full of cash.

23:17.314 --> 23:18.357
How much cash?

23:18.941 --> 23:21.109
I think a little over
a half a million dollars.

23:21.944 --> 23:25.822
Oh, Jesus Christ. Do you have any idea
how bad this is gonna look to the FBI?

23:25.822 --> 23:28.951
I don't know. Maybe less bad
given that she seems to have misplaced it.

23:28.951 --> 23:30.160
Are you fucking kidding me?

23:30.160 --> 23:33.288
Jules, if Hannah is hiding money
her husband stole,

23:33.288 --> 23:35.332
she's gonna be looking at
a conspiracy charge.

23:35.332 --> 23:38.210
- Obstruction of justice--
- We don't know that Owen stole that money.

23:38.210 --> 23:41.046
Oh, please. Who keeps
a half a million dollars in a duffel bag?

23:41.046 --> 23:42.798
See, this is why
she didn't want me to tell you

23:42.798 --> 23:45.092
because she knew you'd freak out
just like you always do.

23:45.092 --> 23:47.803
Oh, right. So th-- It's my fault
she'd rather choose to screw herself

23:47.803 --> 23:49.763
than trust somebody
who actually cares about her.

23:49.763 --> 23:53.016
- She trusted me, Jake. She trusted Owen.
- Look where that got her.

23:53.767 --> 23:56.103
For somebody who has a fear
of getting abandoned again,

23:56.103 --> 23:57.771
she sure does know how to pick 'em.

23:57.771 --> 24:00.107
Hannah does not have a fear
of being abandoned, okay?

24:00.107 --> 24:01.400
She has a fear of being trapped.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.360
So that's why she chose not to marry me.

24:03.360 --> 24:07.030
No, Jake. She didn't marry you
because you're an asshole.

24:10.409 --> 24:11.410
Yeah, maybe.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.414
But if I'm such an asshole...

24:17.916 --> 24:19.334
why am I the one who's here?

24:29.803 --> 24:31.638
- Any progress?
- No.

24:35.517 --> 24:36.560
What's this?

24:37.060 --> 24:39.605
Roster for Spring of '97.

24:39.605 --> 24:43.609
You only taught senior seminars in '96
and then only grad students in '98,

24:43.609 --> 24:45.319
so this has to be the class.

24:45.903 --> 24:47.362
Well done, Cheryl.

24:47.362 --> 24:48.447
Thank you.

24:55.704 --> 24:57.915
I'm sorry.
These names aren't sparking anything.

24:59.791 --> 25:02.377
Seventy-three students. How many men?

25:02.377 --> 25:04.171
Forty-nine. I counted.

25:04.755 --> 25:06.590
That's a hell of a lot better
than a billion.

25:07.382 --> 25:08.675
- May I see it again please?
- Yes.

25:11.637 --> 25:12.638
What?

25:14.014 --> 25:16.433
The young woman.
I was trying to remember her name.

25:17.017 --> 25:18.143
What young woman?

25:18.727 --> 25:22.147
The one he blamed for not being able
to focus on his midterm.

25:22.147 --> 25:25.025
I just remembered
he wrote me this long letter

25:25.025 --> 25:28.779
explaining how he'd fallen in love
with a girl from class.

25:28.779 --> 25:32.074
That he couldn't concentrate around her.
At least, not well.

25:35.285 --> 25:36.787
Could this be her?

25:40.290 --> 25:44.294
I would love to say yes,
but I just don't know.

25:45.838 --> 25:47.548
There's no "Olivia" on the list.

25:50.300 --> 25:52.553
Was that your mother? Olivia?

25:53.136 --> 25:55.264
They met senior year of college.

25:55.889 --> 26:00.269
That's what my dad said,
but maybe it's only half true.

26:00.269 --> 26:01.478
Like everything else.

26:05.148 --> 26:06.692
So, what now?

26:10.529 --> 26:12.906
Cheryl, which library keeps the yearbooks?

26:18.495 --> 26:20.581
Larry has an update for you
on that woman you asked him t--

26:20.581 --> 26:21.748
Tell him he can drop it.

26:36.013 --> 26:37.514
We're dropping the Hannah Hall thing?

26:38.223 --> 26:39.933
Yeah. Did you find something?

26:39.933 --> 26:42.394
She and the girl flew out
of SFO yesterday morning.

26:46.064 --> 26:48.025
Are you fucking kidding me?

26:48.692 --> 26:50.068
Are you fucking kidding me?

26:55.032 --> 26:57.326
The yearbooks were digitized
for the archive.

26:57.826 --> 26:59.203
Here's a guest password.

26:59.203 --> 27:02.247
And there is a line of computers
just through the stacks.

27:02.247 --> 27:04.041
Thank you so much for your help.

27:20.807 --> 27:21.892
Hey.

27:25.687 --> 27:27.773
What are we gonna find in there?

27:29.566 --> 27:32.236
- Let's just go sit down.
- No. What are we--

27:32.236 --> 27:34.321
What are we gonna find out about him?

27:35.739 --> 27:37.366
What are we gonna find out about me?

27:38.534 --> 27:41.620
- I don't even know who I am.
- Bailey.

27:41.620 --> 27:45.415
The worst part is
that he's always been here.

27:48.126 --> 27:51.088
I didn't even go on a sleepover
until I was ten.

27:53.257 --> 27:54.258
And when I did...

27:56.385 --> 28:00.973
my dad sat in his car
and he waited outside until I went to bed,

28:02.015 --> 28:04.226
just to make sure that I didn't need him.

28:04.226 --> 28:05.894
He told me that story.

28:05.894 --> 28:08.355
Did he tell you
that I only made it till 7:30?

28:09.982 --> 28:10.983
And then I--

28:11.900 --> 28:16.488
I ran outside
and I told him I wanted to go home.

28:19.157 --> 28:22.703
He's always been there for me.
He said he'd always be there.

28:24.538 --> 28:28.166
- Bailey, I--
- No. Let's just go.

28:55.611 --> 28:57.487
- Go ahead.
- I can call her back.

28:57.487 --> 28:58.572
I'm fine.

29:01.491 --> 29:02.492
I'm fine.

29:13.462 --> 29:15.297
<i>I don't even know who I am.</i>

29:19.635 --> 29:21.512
<i>She doesn't even know who I am.</i>

29:23.972 --> 29:27.809
- That cargo bed is wasted on you.
- Oh, my God. Do you hear yourself?

29:27.809 --> 29:29.937
I'm just saying
you have nothing to pick up.

29:29.937 --> 29:31.688
If this truck were mine...

29:31.688 --> 29:34.274
You still wouldn't be able
to haul your wood turning shit

29:34.274 --> 29:36.443
'cause you still haven't passed
your road test.

29:36.443 --> 29:37.694
Details.

29:46.787 --> 29:48.372
- Is that--
- Thanks for the ride.

30:27.703 --> 30:29.204
What are you doing to my vase?

30:30.205 --> 30:31.540
Improving it.

30:31.540 --> 30:34.877
This was gonna be the piece
that I was remembered for.

30:34.877 --> 30:36.879
My magnum opus.

30:37.462 --> 30:38.547
It really wasn't.

30:41.258 --> 30:43.385
You wanna come in and say hello
before she leaves?

30:45.554 --> 30:47.431
- No, thanks.
- She wants to see you.

30:48.515 --> 30:49.516
Now?

30:50.017 --> 30:52.978
She wants to see me now?
She doesn't even know who I am now.

30:52.978 --> 30:54.730
She's your mother. She knows you.

30:57.941 --> 30:59.860
Look, she might not know your friends,

30:59.860 --> 31:02.029
or that you're obsessed
with Emmylou Harris.

31:02.029 --> 31:06.074
Or that you're a terrible driver,
but that's you today. Those things change.

31:06.074 --> 31:08.785
Your music, your friends.
Your driving, God-willing.

31:08.785 --> 31:09.953
What's your point?

31:11.246 --> 31:14.082
My point is,
she might be worth keeping around.

31:15.501 --> 31:18.003
How am I supposed to keep her around
if she's never fucking here?

31:19.630 --> 31:20.631
Hannah.

31:22.090 --> 31:23.091
Hannah, come on.

31:33.560 --> 31:34.811
Grandpa...

31:36.104 --> 31:39.149
for the record, I'm an excellent driver.

31:59.628 --> 32:02.172
- Hey.
- I think the safe may be in my studio.

32:02.172 --> 32:03.257
Your studio?

32:03.257 --> 32:06.426
<i>Owen knows there's some pieces
I would never sell or give away.</i>

32:07.261 --> 32:09.137
<i>You remember my grandfather's vase, right?</i>

32:09.137 --> 32:10.973
- Yeah.
- Check the bottom of it.

32:10.973 --> 32:12.057
Will do.

32:13.600 --> 32:17.604
Listen, you're sure that duffel bag was
under your bed?

32:19.273 --> 32:21.108
Positive. Why?

32:22.734 --> 32:24.236
Because it's not there now.

32:26.071 --> 32:27.990
- You sure?
- I'm sure, Han.

32:28.574 --> 32:29.825
What do you want me to do?

32:34.955 --> 32:35.956
Find the safe.

32:52.389 --> 32:53.724
No luck yet, huh?

33:03.984 --> 33:04.985
What?

33:07.738 --> 33:10.282
You know, I was a little like you
when I was your age.

33:10.282 --> 33:12.492
I hadn't really thought about that before.

33:14.703 --> 33:15.704
Okay.

33:18.248 --> 33:19.541
You don't believe me, do you?

33:21.668 --> 33:26.298
Well, I don't really know who I am now,
so I don't even know what that means.

33:26.298 --> 33:29.092
Hey, I know who you are. You do too.

33:30.135 --> 33:32.804
Your name, your birthday,
those are just details.

33:33.639 --> 33:35.098
Pretty important details.

33:35.098 --> 33:37.518
Even without everything that's going on,

33:38.268 --> 33:43.023
plenty of people are gonna try to tell you
who you are or who you're supposed to be.

33:43.565 --> 33:46.151
I'm just saying, I think you know already.

33:47.653 --> 33:48.737
For what it's worth,

33:48.737 --> 33:51.865
I think you're smart enough
to decide the rest for yourself

33:51.865 --> 33:53.617
and stubborn enough to stick to it.

33:59.039 --> 34:00.207
You think I'm stubborn?

34:01.583 --> 34:03.544
That's what you took from all that?

34:12.511 --> 34:14.513
- Hello.
- Scrimmages.

34:14.513 --> 34:16.473
<i>I didn't think about the scrimmages.</i>

34:17.056 --> 34:18.725
I'm sorry. Who is this?

34:18.725 --> 34:20.768
<i>It's Elenor McGovern at the church.</i>

34:20.768 --> 34:24.523
You came by yesterday asking
about game day weddings in '11?

34:25.023 --> 34:26.108
Right. Of course.

34:26.108 --> 34:29.444
<i>Well, I told your story
to one of our parishioners and,</i>

34:29.444 --> 34:31.905
well, her older son is a Longhorn

34:31.905 --> 34:35.659
and she pointed out that it could've been
a pre-season wedding.

34:35.659 --> 34:38.203
And I thought, "Oh my Lord, am I a dummy."

34:38.203 --> 34:41.206
It never even occurred to me
to check the scrimmages.

34:41.206 --> 34:43.583
Wait, the scrimmages are held
at the stadium?

34:43.583 --> 34:47.295
Just like regular games, that's right.
And they pack the stands pretty good too.

34:47.295 --> 34:50.632
Elenor, did you happen to check
the scrimmage dates for the season?

34:50.632 --> 34:56.722
I did. And it turns out we had a wedding
the same day as the final scrimmage

34:57.389 --> 35:00.184
- and it was the Reyes and Smith wedding.
- What's going on?

35:00.184 --> 35:03.687
- The ceremony was held at noon.
- Wait. Okay, I'm sorry.

35:03.687 --> 35:07.232
- Reyes, R-E-Y-E-S?
- That's right.

35:07.232 --> 35:08.609
- And Smith?
- Yes.

35:08.609 --> 35:12.362
There's no Reyes,
but there's a Katherine Smith.

35:12.988 --> 35:15.365
Elenor,
was the bride's first name Katherine?

35:16.241 --> 35:18.493
No, the bride wasn't named Katherine.

35:18.493 --> 35:20.871
Her name was Andrea.

35:22.039 --> 35:23.916
And, well, the husband was--

35:24.917 --> 35:27.669
<i>his name was, give me a second, Charles.</i>

35:27.669 --> 35:30.547
It was Andrea Reyes and Charles Smith.

35:30.547 --> 35:33.133
This is above and beyond.
Thank you so much.

35:33.133 --> 35:34.760
<i>Well, it's my pleasure.</i>

35:35.260 --> 35:38.430
It looks like you were right
about being at that church after all.

35:39.097 --> 35:39.932
Maybe.

35:41.225 --> 35:43.477
Is one of them Katherine Smith?

35:44.895 --> 35:47.231
It's what the index says.

35:50.734 --> 35:51.735
Wait.

35:55.364 --> 35:56.490
Bailey.
