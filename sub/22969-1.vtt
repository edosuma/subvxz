00:17.000 --> 00:20.567
( speaking Italian )

00:25.167 --> 00:27.367
- ( note plays )
- ( gasps )

00:43.033 --> 00:44.700
( speaking Italian )

00:51.833 --> 00:53.367
No.

01:07.667 --> 01:10.867
Monsignor Vega,
We found the map to the stones.

01:10.867 --> 01:12.867
Bring it to me immediately,
my son.

01:12.867 --> 01:15.167
When we have
the other three stones,

01:15.167 --> 01:17.367
there'll be nothing
to stop us.

01:26.600 --> 01:30.533
Ah.

01:37.667 --> 01:40.667
( theme music playing )

01:51.833 --> 01:53.200
- Mr. Stone.
- What?

01:53.200 --> 01:55.033
The wreaths--
uh, under the lions, please.

01:55.033 --> 01:58.733
Under the lions.
Mr. Jones, these candles
will not light themselves.

01:58.733 --> 02:01.767
And what is
the Spear of Destiny
doing here?

02:01.767 --> 02:04.333
There are no weapons
in this ceremony, gentlemen.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.900
"Bonded together.
Bonded together

02:06.900 --> 02:08.433
through
everlasting unity."

02:08.433 --> 02:11.333
What do you think?
Up or down?

02:11.333 --> 02:12.700
( chuckles )
So exciting.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.867
Is he even here yet?
I bet he isn't even here yet.

02:14.867 --> 02:16.800
Don't worry.
He'll be here.

02:16.800 --> 02:20.700
( barking, whimpering )

02:20.700 --> 02:22.700
Five more minutes.

02:22.700 --> 02:25.267
( barking )

02:25.267 --> 02:26.633
Ow!

02:26.633 --> 02:27.633
( gasps )

02:32.633 --> 02:34.467
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What is that?
- ( flute whistling )

02:34.467 --> 02:37.833
Pan's Flute.
A little mood music.

02:37.833 --> 02:39.900
No, sir.
This is not a Zamfir concert.

02:39.900 --> 02:41.333
- Please put it back.
- She's ready!

02:41.333 --> 02:43.200
Very well.
Places, please.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.000
Mr. Jones!
Thank you.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.667
Um, what? Wait.
Where's--

02:47.667 --> 02:49.500
Coming!

02:49.500 --> 02:51.900
Sorry. I'm late.

02:51.900 --> 02:53.600
Love what you've done
with the place.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.867
( grumbles )

02:55.867 --> 02:57.967
( flute playing )

02:57.967 --> 02:59.400
( grunts )

03:18.200 --> 03:19.800
You look beautiful.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.100
I know.

03:23.100 --> 03:26.200
Librarians, Artifacts,

03:26.200 --> 03:28.967
we are gathered here today
to witness the eternal union

03:28.967 --> 03:30.533
of Flynn Carsen
and Eve Baird.

03:30.533 --> 03:34.633
Today they take a sacred vow
that has been passed down

03:34.633 --> 03:36.000
through the centuries.
Oh.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.567
May I see the ceremonial ring,
Mr. Carsen?

03:43.333 --> 03:44.800
Baird: Ahem.

03:44.800 --> 03:48.733
( chuckles )
You thought I forgot.

03:48.733 --> 03:50.733
- Oh!
- ( groans )

03:50.733 --> 03:55.067
- Your hair!
- Oh, no. I'm so sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

03:55.067 --> 03:56.633
Is it bad? You know what?
Is there a towel?

03:56.633 --> 03:58.933
If you're not going to take
this rehearsal seriously--

03:58.933 --> 04:00.600
- ( snorts )
- We are taking it seriously.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.400
We've been practicing
this thing for months.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.967
And it's not like they're
actually getting married.

04:03.967 --> 04:05.633
It is much more important
than a marriage.

04:05.633 --> 04:10.333
Tethering is
the most important
ritual in the Library.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.400
When a Librarian
and a Guardian tether--

04:12.400 --> 04:15.900
They become immortal and create
a spiritual connection
with the Library.

04:15.900 --> 04:17.500
Anchoring it to humanity.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.000
And it can only happen
during a vernal equinox,
we know.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.300
We must take this seriously.

04:21.300 --> 04:23.367
Anchoring to humanity
is the one thing

04:23.367 --> 04:26.700
that ensures the Library
remains a force for good.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.500
Charlene was the last to be
tethered after Judson passed.

04:29.500 --> 04:32.467
Now that she is gone,
the Library is unprotected,

04:32.467 --> 04:37.367
and each passing day
that it remains untethered,
it is vulnerable.

04:37.367 --> 04:39.800
From what? I'm--
I'm not trying to be cocky.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.900
I'm just saying
we defeated Apep.

04:41.900 --> 04:43.367
We cancelled
the apocalypse.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.933
And the ley lines
are back down to normal.

04:45.933 --> 04:47.500
Yeah. Aren't we supposed
to be, like, good?

04:47.500 --> 04:50.467
No, sir, we are not good.
Apep was prophecy.

04:50.467 --> 04:52.300
We knew the ultimate
battle was coming.

04:52.300 --> 04:55.000
It was foretold.
But now that we
have defeated him--

04:55.000 --> 04:56.500
We are past
the point of prophecy,

04:56.500 --> 04:58.933
meaning we don't know
what's going to happen next,

04:58.933 --> 05:00.533
meaning
anything can happen.

05:00.533 --> 05:03.167
Meaning we have
to rehearse this again.

05:05.367 --> 05:07.700
It's called
the Maid of the Mist.
Right off the end of the dock.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.700
You can't miss it.

05:16.667 --> 05:18.533
( speaks Italian )

05:24.833 --> 05:28.800
Ranger:
Hey, what in the goddamn hell
do you think you're doing?

05:28.800 --> 05:31.100
Oh, sorry, Father.
I didn't see the--

05:31.100 --> 05:33.867
- It's quite all right.
- Look, this is park property.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.100
You can't go smashing it
with crow--

05:36.100 --> 05:39.700
Hey, what's that
you got there?

05:39.700 --> 05:43.633
Tell me...

05:43.633 --> 05:45.500
do you believe in God?

05:45.500 --> 05:47.000
Um, yes.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.900
Good.
It's time for you to meet him.

05:49.900 --> 05:53.233
Baird:
"In bibliotheco mio vido--"

05:53.233 --> 05:55.100
"Mia vita. Mia vita."

05:55.100 --> 05:56.833
How much longer
do we have to do this?

05:56.833 --> 06:00.300
Until we get it right.
Now, repeat after me,
Mr. Carsen.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.667
- Mr. Carsen!
- ( gasps )
Mr. Carsen.

06:02.667 --> 06:05.233
- Yeah.
- ( alarm blaring )

06:05.233 --> 06:08.133
- What's that?
- Both: The Receiver!

06:09.767 --> 06:12.767
( alarm blaring )

06:20.367 --> 06:23.300
Just as I feared.
One of the stones
has been unearthed.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.933
The stones?
What stones?

06:24.933 --> 06:26.767
One of the four cornerstones
of the Library of Alexandria.

06:26.767 --> 06:30.100
Stone:
Alexandria? See, now that,
that's a library.

06:30.100 --> 06:32.600
Built in Egypt
around, what?
300 B.C.?

06:32.600 --> 06:34.167
It was the most famous
center of knowledge

06:34.167 --> 06:36.600
in all of the history
of ancient civilization.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.200
And it was also
the original magic Library.

06:39.200 --> 06:42.867
That is until 48 B.C.
when old Caesar came along,

06:42.867 --> 06:47.267
invading Egypt
and torching the place.

06:47.267 --> 06:49.600
What remained was protected
by the Librarian at the time,

06:49.600 --> 06:51.633
Agathocles the Nimble,
who removed the stones,

06:51.633 --> 06:54.333
effectively
transporting the Library
from this reality...

06:54.333 --> 06:57.333
To the alternate dimension
that we know today.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.133
He hid the stones
all around the world

06:59.133 --> 07:00.633
so that it could
never be reassembled

07:00.633 --> 07:03.467
and the Library could never
be made physical again.

07:03.467 --> 07:05.400
Let me guess.
Because that would be bad.

07:05.400 --> 07:08.500
Imagine, if you will,
the Library is cloud storage

07:08.500 --> 07:09.967
and we are the phone.

07:09.967 --> 07:11.467
And there's this
massive cloud
up there.

07:11.467 --> 07:13.100
It's getting bigger.
And it's getting bigger

07:13.100 --> 07:14.933
the more information
we put up into it.

07:14.933 --> 07:17.267
Now imagine that cloud
physicalizing.

07:17.267 --> 07:18.967
All of the data
would become real,

07:18.967 --> 07:20.833
the weight of which
would--

07:20.833 --> 07:23.667
The Library
would implode.

07:23.667 --> 07:25.867
Okay, so some baddie's
found a cornerstone

07:25.867 --> 07:28.267
and is probably now
after the other three
so he can destroy the Library.

07:28.267 --> 07:29.867
We just have
to get there first.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.267
Librarian 101.

07:31.267 --> 07:33.133
Just one
small little hitch.

07:33.133 --> 07:35.067
We have no idea
where in the world they are.

07:35.067 --> 07:37.067
That's not small.

07:37.067 --> 07:39.500
Well, you just said
a Librarian hid them.
Didn't he leave a map?

07:39.500 --> 07:41.833
- No.
- How about a clue?
Tell me we got a clue.

07:41.833 --> 07:45.167
- We have no clue.
- What about the Receiver and
the woop, woop, woop, woop?

07:45.167 --> 07:46.633
Yes, when the stone
is unearthed

07:46.633 --> 07:48.433
it emits a distress signal
like a call for help,

07:48.433 --> 07:50.800
but we only know
after the stone
has been taken.

07:50.800 --> 07:54.200
- So we're stuck, then.
- Hey...

07:54.200 --> 07:57.100
Jenkins?
What is it?

07:57.100 --> 07:58.533
- What? Nothing.
- What?

07:58.533 --> 08:02.167
Jenkins,
do you know something
that might help us?

08:02.167 --> 08:05.267
No.

08:05.267 --> 08:08.300
Well, yes.
But... no.

08:08.300 --> 08:11.067
Jenkins, please.
If this is as serious
as Flynn says it is,

08:11.067 --> 08:13.000
we need all the help
we can get.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.733
Never been
down here before.

08:38.733 --> 08:41.300
Yes, well...
( exhales sharply )

08:41.300 --> 08:44.133
...this may come
as a shock.

08:48.067 --> 08:50.267
Who is that?

08:56.567 --> 08:58.367
My Guardian.

09:01.567 --> 09:04.000
Nicole...

09:04.000 --> 09:05.900
you're alive.

09:05.900 --> 09:07.933
Hello, Flynn.

09:07.933 --> 09:11.033
Surprised to see me?

09:11.033 --> 09:12.833
Please, sir, no.
Please step away
from the door.

09:12.833 --> 09:14.400
- But why is she
locked up in here?
- Mr. Carsen, just--

09:14.400 --> 09:16.100
We have to get her out.
She shouldn't be in here.

09:16.100 --> 09:18.967
- Flynn, what's going on?
- This is Nicole Noone,

09:18.967 --> 09:20.900
my first Guardian.

09:20.900 --> 09:23.067
She helped me find
the Spear of Destiny.
She taught me everything.

09:23.067 --> 09:26.400
I mean, 13 years ago
I'm having a cup of coffee
and Nicole shows up.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.933
She tells me somebody's stolen
H.G. Wells' time machine
and we have to get it back.

09:29.933 --> 09:33.133
( music playing )

09:40.100 --> 09:42.300
Hello, gorgeous.

09:44.400 --> 09:47.400
So we tracked the ninjas
to their hideout,

09:47.400 --> 09:50.233
and, after a fight,
there was a malfunction

09:50.233 --> 09:53.100
with the time machine
and it--

09:53.100 --> 09:55.133
it blew up.
I watched you die.

09:55.133 --> 09:58.667
And yet here I am.

09:58.667 --> 10:00.567
How is
that possible, Flynn?

10:02.900 --> 10:05.200
The explosion must have
created a rift,

10:05.200 --> 10:06.600
sent you back in time.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.900
500 years to be exact.

10:08.900 --> 10:12.067
But who's counting?

10:12.067 --> 10:16.833
Oh, how I waited for you
to come rescue me, Flynn.

10:16.833 --> 10:19.767
I waited and waited

10:19.767 --> 10:22.467
and waited.

10:22.467 --> 10:24.933
But you never came.

10:24.933 --> 10:28.567
- Um...
- Pardon me? 500 years?

10:28.567 --> 10:30.133
How are you still alive?

10:30.133 --> 10:32.400
Immortality artifact,

10:32.400 --> 10:33.767
which she stole.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.800
Along
with countless others.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.600
You see,
Ms. Noone became immortal

10:38.600 --> 10:42.600
in order to exact revenge
on those she thought

10:42.600 --> 10:45.167
had abandoned her.

10:45.167 --> 10:46.833
She wanted to hurt you,
Mr. Carsen.

10:46.833 --> 10:49.633
She wanted
to hurt the Library
and nearly succeeded.

10:49.633 --> 10:52.400
A hundred years ago,
we discovered she had found

10:52.400 --> 10:55.033
the cornerstones
to the Library of Alexandria.

10:55.033 --> 10:56.900
- Cillian:
She found the stones?
- Three of them.

10:56.900 --> 11:00.533
Very clever though.
She hid them before I had
the chance to apprehend her.

11:00.533 --> 11:02.033
Wait a minute.

11:02.033 --> 11:03.200
You locked her up?

11:03.200 --> 11:05.300
You let me believe
that she was dead.

11:05.300 --> 11:07.633
You never told me!
I could have gone back in time
and saved her!

11:07.633 --> 11:10.400
No, sir. No, sir.
In order to survive
the ultimate battle,

11:10.400 --> 11:13.467
everything had to flow
exactly according to prophecy,

11:13.467 --> 11:17.200
which meant you could not
know the truth.

11:17.200 --> 11:21.267
Hmm.
Well, now that
we're all caught up,

11:21.267 --> 11:25.533
to what do I owe
the pleasure of this visit?

11:25.533 --> 11:29.033
Ah, the cornerstones.

11:29.033 --> 11:31.700
Someone's found one of them,
haven't they?

11:31.700 --> 11:35.300
And you want me to tell you
where I hid the others.

11:35.300 --> 11:39.800
- We don't have much time.
- What do you know of time?

11:39.800 --> 11:43.700
Nicole, please,
help us.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.000
( chuckles )

11:49.000 --> 11:53.067
( laughing )

11:53.067 --> 11:56.133
Well, we can't sit around
all day waiting for her
to change her mind.

11:56.133 --> 11:59.000
Jenkins, where was
the first stone taken from?

11:59.000 --> 12:03.833
43.09 degrees north
by 79.03 degrees west.

12:03.833 --> 12:06.700
- That's Niagara Falls.
- Okay, you three go
to Niagara Falls.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.533
See what you can dig up.
Find out what we're
dealing with.

12:08.533 --> 12:11.033
And we'll try
and get Nicole to talk.

12:13.567 --> 12:18.000
Come on.
Let's get him in the truck.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.300
Well, it looks like
we're in the right place.

12:21.300 --> 12:24.067
Excuse me, hi.
What happened here?

12:24.067 --> 12:26.133
It was an accident.
Park ranger fell into the Falls.

12:26.133 --> 12:28.000
Or he was pushed.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.100
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

12:30.100 --> 12:33.133
- Cassandra and Stone:
We're the Librarians.
- Jones: I'm the Librarian.

12:36.133 --> 12:38.000
- What did you just say?
- You always get to say it!

12:38.000 --> 12:41.400
- You can't say it together
or it doesn't work!
- Guys, guys.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.400
Look over there.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.033
This is Annie Edson Taylor's
barrel.

12:50.033 --> 12:52.567
First person to make it
over the falls successfully.

12:52.567 --> 12:54.100
1901.

12:54.100 --> 12:56.067
That was over
100 years ago.

12:56.067 --> 12:58.133
Do you think Nicole
could have hid one of
the cornerstones in there?

12:58.133 --> 13:00.033
Well, why would
she hide it here, huh?

13:00.033 --> 13:03.100
- What's Nicole's pattern?
- Her pattern is that
she's insane.

13:03.100 --> 13:05.600
I mean, you heard Jenkins.
She's in that cell for a reason.

13:05.600 --> 13:09.133
Yeah, but since when did
we start locking people up
in secret dungeons?

13:09.133 --> 13:10.533
And a Guardian,
what's more?

13:10.533 --> 13:12.433
Thought we were supposed
to be the good guys.

13:12.433 --> 13:14.200
She tried to hurt
the Library.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.733
I mean, what did you
expect Jenkins to do?

13:15.733 --> 13:19.267
- Give her a time out?
- Still, makes you think.

13:19.267 --> 13:20.867
What else is the Library
not telling us?

13:20.867 --> 13:24.600
Guys...
it's a priest cassock.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.167
Tell by the black piping.
Hung out around a lot

13:27.167 --> 13:29.500
of Catholic schools
when I was a teenager.

13:29.500 --> 13:32.367
Or at least a lot
of Catholic schoolgirls.

13:32.367 --> 13:34.367
Sorry, but...

13:34.367 --> 13:37.800
Okay, so our bad guy
is some evil rogue priest.

13:37.800 --> 13:41.567
- How are we gonna find him?
- Ready, one, two, three.
Good job.

13:41.567 --> 13:45.100
- I've got an idea.
- Great. One more expression.

13:45.100 --> 13:47.933
Oh, yes!
Cheesy tourist photos!
Mind if I...?

13:47.933 --> 13:51.033
- You know, I just-- one--
- Hey! Hey.

13:55.633 --> 13:58.367
- What are you doing, man?
- We're looking for a priest,
right?

13:58.367 --> 14:00.500
One that passed by here
in the last couple of hours.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.733
Well, if we're lucky,
our photographer has got him
in the background

14:03.733 --> 14:06.567
of one of these pictures.

14:06.567 --> 14:10.100
Gotcha.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.567
Flynn:
Nicole, come on.
Talk to us.

14:11.567 --> 14:13.133
We're not leaving here
until you tell us

14:13.133 --> 14:15.033
where the stones are.

14:15.033 --> 14:17.433
You were a Guardian once.
It's not too late to still
act like one.

14:17.433 --> 14:19.667
I never stopped
being a Guardian.

14:19.667 --> 14:23.300
I kept my oath.
You only think I meant
to do harm with the stones

14:23.300 --> 14:26.133
because that's what
Jenkins told you.

14:26.133 --> 14:31.133
But, really,
I was keeping them safe.
I was doing my job.

14:31.133 --> 14:34.000
But then why not give them
to the Library?

14:35.967 --> 14:37.967
Because it can't be trusted.

14:37.967 --> 14:40.467
Me being in this cell
is living proof of that.

14:40.467 --> 14:42.700
You two blindly work
for this place,

14:42.700 --> 14:44.433
accepting all the rules.

14:44.433 --> 14:47.133
Believing the Library
is all good and all-knowing.

14:47.133 --> 14:50.133
But it's an institution
just like any other.

14:50.133 --> 14:51.867
It can make mistakes.

14:51.867 --> 14:53.833
- This is ridiculous.
- Shh! Jenkins!

14:53.833 --> 14:55.733
- I want to hear
what she's saying.
- What's the matter, Galahad?

14:55.733 --> 14:56.967
Afraid they'll
learn the truth?

14:56.967 --> 14:58.900
She is trying
to manipulate you.

14:58.900 --> 15:00.900
She wants you to think
she is innocent.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.100
She stole artifacts
to hurt us.

15:04.100 --> 15:07.600
If that's the case,
why hadn't I used any of them?

15:07.600 --> 15:09.967
In the hundreds of years
before you threw me in here,

15:09.967 --> 15:12.967
did I ever use an artifact
against the Library?

15:12.967 --> 15:14.167
Against anyone?

15:14.167 --> 15:15.800
The immortality artifact.

15:15.800 --> 15:17.733
She used
the immortality artifact.

15:17.733 --> 15:19.300
Yes.

15:19.300 --> 15:21.033
On myself.

15:21.033 --> 15:23.233
And you know why?

15:27.000 --> 15:29.500
For you, Flynn.

15:29.500 --> 15:33.633
I became immortal in the hope
of seeing you again.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.400
I never stopped loving you.

15:36.400 --> 15:39.433
All right,
Colonel Baird, Mr. Carsen,
please listen to me.

15:39.433 --> 15:41.633
No matter what Nicole says,
the fact remains

15:41.633 --> 15:43.367
she is an immortal.

15:43.367 --> 15:46.800
That comes with
a very heavy price,
believe me, I know.

15:46.800 --> 15:50.267
Going through the centuries
watching everyone die,

15:50.267 --> 15:52.700
watching loved ones die,
it darkens one's soul.

15:52.700 --> 15:56.500
It takes every inch of fiber
to stay connected to humanity.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.833
Charlene--

15:58.833 --> 16:00.500
Charlene did that for me,

16:00.500 --> 16:05.867
but Nicole's immortality
has twisted her soul
beyond redemption.

16:05.867 --> 16:08.433
You cannot trust her,
believe me.

16:08.433 --> 16:12.400
Believe you?
The man who let Flynn
think I was dead?

16:12.400 --> 16:14.367
If what you say is true,
Nicole,

16:14.367 --> 16:17.300
if you really are
still a Guardian, prove it.

16:17.300 --> 16:19.967
I will.

16:19.967 --> 16:21.333
But I'll only tell him.

16:26.933 --> 16:29.200
And you're sure these priests
took the stone?

16:29.200 --> 16:31.367
Yeah, and they left a piece
of clothing behind.

16:31.367 --> 16:34.100
We even got their mugs
on camera.

16:36.967 --> 16:38.433
Zoom in on the cross.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.600
Flames.
Oh, dear.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.033
I don't like it
when he says, "Oh, dear."

16:45.033 --> 16:46.800
Yeah, well, that--
that symbol

16:46.800 --> 16:51.100
marks him
as a member of the
Heretic Order of Shadows,

16:51.100 --> 16:55.833
a sect hidden deep within
the Roman Catholic Church.

16:55.833 --> 16:58.500
The symbol
represents the fire

16:58.500 --> 17:01.700
that destroyed
the Library Alexandria.

17:01.700 --> 17:04.133
The order was formed
in the 1700s

17:04.133 --> 17:06.367
as a revolt against
Age of Enlightenment.

17:06.367 --> 17:08.433
And the Order of Shadows'
primary purpose,

17:08.433 --> 17:12.167
it's reason for being,
is to reestablish the Dark Ages.

17:12.167 --> 17:14.433
Baird: That explains why
they want the cornerstones.

17:14.433 --> 17:17.067
Destroy the Library,
destroy all knowledge
and enlightenment.

17:17.067 --> 17:19.700
The rumor has been for years
that one of the stones

17:19.700 --> 17:22.200
was already in the possession
of the Order.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.167
Which means, including
the one at Niagara,

17:24.167 --> 17:25.833
they now have two
of the stones.

17:25.833 --> 17:27.567
Flynn better
come through with Nicole.

17:28.733 --> 17:31.367
You look fit,
content.

17:31.367 --> 17:33.167
She's taking
good care of you.

17:33.167 --> 17:34.900
She's
an excellent Guardian.

17:34.900 --> 17:36.767
That she is.

17:36.767 --> 17:40.633
Tell me, do you date
all of your Guardians
or just the blonde ones?

17:40.633 --> 17:42.867
What is this?

17:42.867 --> 17:44.667
You've got me
here alone, now what?

17:44.667 --> 17:48.000
Relax.
I just want to talk.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.433
We used to talk
all the time, remember?

17:50.433 --> 17:52.533
What would you
like to know?

17:52.533 --> 17:54.167
Favorite color?

17:54.167 --> 17:55.300
Most painful
childhood memory?

17:55.300 --> 17:57.700
Tell me about the day
I disappeared.

18:02.567 --> 18:04.800
Why? You were there.
You-- you know what happened.

18:04.800 --> 18:07.767
I'm 500 years old, Flynn.

18:07.767 --> 18:09.333
Refresh my memory.

18:11.933 --> 18:15.633
Well, it was, um,
like I said,

18:15.633 --> 18:21.200
we followed the ninjas
back to their hideout

18:21.200 --> 18:25.233
and, uh,
it was a malfunction
with the time machine

18:25.233 --> 18:26.833
and it blew up
while you were near it.

18:26.833 --> 18:30.067
Ah.
That's right.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.400
A malfunction
with the time machine.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.233
And why do you think
it malfunctioned?

18:34.233 --> 18:36.667
I don't know.
I'm not a time machine
repairman.

18:36.667 --> 18:38.767
But you're a Librarian.
Guess.

18:38.767 --> 18:42.033
Well, core overheated.
Fusion capacitor could have
come uncoupled.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.400
Could have been any number
of one of those things.

18:43.400 --> 18:45.567
Yes, it could have.
But it wasn't, was it, Flynn?

18:45.567 --> 18:48.533
- I don't-- I don't know.
- Do you remember
what you said to me

18:48.533 --> 18:50.533
right before it blew?

18:50.533 --> 18:54.000
You-- you called out my name
as if to warn me.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.800
Well, we were
fighting ninjas, you know?

18:55.800 --> 18:58.133
No.
You yelled out to me

18:58.133 --> 19:00.500
as if you knew
it was going to explode.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.633
- I don't know what you--
- How did you know it was going
to explode, Flynn?

19:03.633 --> 19:05.633
- How could I know?
I didn't know.
- How did you know?

19:05.633 --> 19:07.867
- I couldn't know.
How can I poss--
- How did you know?

19:07.867 --> 19:10.300
It wasn't supposed
to explode!

19:15.233 --> 19:18.000
While you were fighting,
I rewired the machine

19:18.000 --> 19:19.967
so that if the ninjas
tried to use it,

19:19.967 --> 19:22.400
it would suspend time
and freeze anyone
that came near it.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.600
I thought
I was being clever.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.500
But I screwed up...

19:32.767 --> 19:35.300
and it exploded
and it-- it cau--

19:35.300 --> 19:39.933
it caught you
in its wake and...

19:39.933 --> 19:43.067
I'm the reason
all this happened to you.

19:44.900 --> 19:48.467
You put your faith into me.

19:48.467 --> 19:50.467
I failed you.

19:55.833 --> 19:58.533
( exhales )

19:58.533 --> 20:01.367
Jupiter's moon
at the house on the lake.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.133
That's where
you'll find the stone.

20:18.267 --> 20:20.733
"Jupiter's moon
at the house on the lake"?

20:20.733 --> 20:24.267
Good God. Couldn't she just
put an address in Google Maps
and be done with it?

20:24.267 --> 20:26.467
And that's all Nicole said?

20:29.333 --> 20:31.333
What the hell happened
down there?

20:35.200 --> 20:38.433
Okay, so Jupiter has
67 moons.

20:38.433 --> 20:42.967
Europa, Io, Callisto,
Aoide, Ganymede--

20:42.967 --> 20:44.733
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

20:44.733 --> 20:46.000
Aoide?

20:46.000 --> 20:47.567
Yeah.

20:47.567 --> 20:52.167
Flynn, it was named
after a Greek muse.

20:52.167 --> 20:56.133
The Library of Alexandria
was dedicated to three muses.

20:56.133 --> 20:57.333
I don't even
know how all this--

20:57.333 --> 20:59.000
how can I not
come up with that?

20:59.000 --> 21:00.933
Come up with what?
What did you not come up with?

21:00.933 --> 21:05.167
Along with the map,
Nicole must have devised
some sort of mnemonic device

21:05.167 --> 21:08.033
that allowed her to remember
where she hid the stones.

21:08.033 --> 21:10.433
Each stone is connected
to a muse.

21:10.433 --> 21:14.167
That's why we found the first
stone at Niagara Falls.

21:14.167 --> 21:16.733
It was connected
to Melete,

21:16.733 --> 21:18.433
Muse of Thought,

21:18.433 --> 21:19.967
symbolized by...

21:19.967 --> 21:21.367
Water.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.333
Water!

21:23.333 --> 21:28.367
She must have hid the next stone
somewhere connected to Aoide,

21:28.367 --> 21:29.633
Muse of Song.

21:29.633 --> 21:32.600
So where do we
start looking?

21:32.600 --> 21:34.200
Le Palais Garnier,

21:34.200 --> 21:38.600
otherwise known
as the Paris Opera House.

21:38.600 --> 21:42.533
Legend had it it was built
over a subterranean lake
in the 1860s.

21:42.533 --> 21:44.167
"House on the lake."

21:44.167 --> 21:47.033
- Jenkins!
- Door to Paris coming up.

21:47.033 --> 21:49.133
You three grab the stone,
come right back.

21:49.133 --> 21:51.233
I've got some things here
to take care of.

21:56.867 --> 21:58.533
( grunts )

21:58.533 --> 21:59.933
Oh.

21:59.933 --> 22:02.433
Oh.

22:02.433 --> 22:04.967
Oh!

22:04.967 --> 22:06.833
Would you look at this?

22:06.833 --> 22:10.100
Huh?
Would you look at this?

22:10.100 --> 22:11.600
I don't know
if you guys know it,

22:11.600 --> 22:14.233
Gaston Leroux based
"Phantom of the Opera"
right here.

22:14.233 --> 22:19.567
- Right here.
- * Really I did not know that

22:19.567 --> 22:23.067
* Well I'm not lying.

22:23.067 --> 22:26.767
All right,
the cornerstone is here.
Guys, split up.

22:26.767 --> 22:28.233
Let's find it.

22:28.233 --> 22:30.700
- ( blows landing )
- ( grunting )

22:35.333 --> 22:39.133
Find the stone.
Kill anyone who gets
in your way.

22:47.967 --> 22:50.167
( opera singers
warming up )

22:52.067 --> 22:53.533
Find anything?

22:53.533 --> 22:55.867
I don't even know where to look.
This place is massive.

22:55.867 --> 22:58.733
Hey, guys,
check this out.

23:02.700 --> 23:04.367
Guys...

23:04.367 --> 23:07.200
this is the Emperor's chair
from the 1800s.

23:07.200 --> 23:10.400
Built for Napoleon III himself.
Best seat in the house.

23:10.400 --> 23:12.733
Well, it depends
on what you mean by best.

23:12.733 --> 23:14.300
What are you doing?

23:15.967 --> 23:18.167
- Opera glasses.
- Oh.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.633
Jones:
What do you see?

23:24.633 --> 23:27.300
Stone:
I see beautiful architecture,
my brother.

23:27.300 --> 23:29.667
Something that goes
right over your head.

23:29.667 --> 23:31.967
- Oh.
- What is it?

23:31.967 --> 23:34.033
Stone:
Nicole, you're very sly.

23:41.633 --> 23:44.400
( gasps )
Jenkins! Jesus!

23:44.400 --> 23:48.100
Sorry. So you've
discovered the cameras
in her cell.

23:48.100 --> 23:49.533
Flynn was right,
you know.

23:49.533 --> 23:52.133
Innocent or not,
you should have
gone back for her.

23:52.133 --> 23:54.033
No soldier left behind.

23:54.033 --> 23:58.000
We had no choice.
Everything she did
over the last 500 years

23:58.000 --> 24:01.933
was prophecy.
It had to happen as it did.

24:01.933 --> 24:04.900
Jenkins, if it was me...

24:04.900 --> 24:07.333
would you have done
the same thing?

24:07.333 --> 24:08.500
Absolutely.

24:19.200 --> 24:22.400
( opera singers
warming up )

24:27.533 --> 24:29.067
Bingo.

24:34.267 --> 24:35.733
( grunts )
No bingo.

24:35.733 --> 24:36.733
Yeah.

24:38.100 --> 24:40.967
Looks like a thick quartz,
maybe crystal.

24:40.967 --> 24:42.367
Sealed from the inside.

24:42.367 --> 24:44.033
Wait a minute.

24:44.033 --> 24:45.800
Nicole used
the Muse of Song

24:45.800 --> 24:47.000
as the key
to her hiding place, right?

24:47.000 --> 24:48.600
Maybe that
was only half of it.

24:48.600 --> 24:52.333
Maybe the key
to getting the stone
is with song.

24:52.333 --> 24:55.333
If we can estimate
the size and thickness
of the crystal,

24:55.333 --> 24:57.767
we can calculate
the resonant frequency
at which it vibrates.

24:57.767 --> 25:00.233
The human voice is a series
of air pressure waves

25:00.233 --> 25:03.500
with the pitch related
to the frequency of the waves,

25:03.500 --> 25:06.367
so if we can match our pitch
to the frequency of the crystal,

25:06.367 --> 25:11.300
the vibrations should cause
the crystal to break.

25:11.300 --> 25:14.067
Two octaves
above middle C.

25:14.067 --> 25:15.300
Well, uh, go for it,
Pavarotti.

25:15.300 --> 25:16.667
We all need to do it
together.

25:16.667 --> 25:18.567
Oh, uh, no, no, no.

25:18.567 --> 25:22.200
The crystal's too thick.
We need the intensity
of all of our voices.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.500
Yeah, but I'm not really
into opera, so...

25:24.500 --> 25:26.433
Did you not hear
what she just said?

25:26.433 --> 25:28.067
You want the stone
or not, Jones?

25:28.067 --> 25:30.400
( sighs )

25:30.400 --> 25:32.500
( vocalizing )

25:32.500 --> 25:35.700
( both vocalizing )

25:35.700 --> 25:38.700
( all vocalizing )

25:43.400 --> 25:46.000
( chuckles )

25:46.000 --> 25:48.200
All right.

25:49.967 --> 25:53.733
All right. Let's, uh--
let's get out of here.

25:53.733 --> 25:56.133
- ( music playing,
woman singing )
- Let's go. Come on.

26:06.067 --> 26:08.267
Go on.
I'll meet you guys
at the door.

26:08.267 --> 26:11.900
I got news for you,
I don't know how comfortable
I am hitting a man of the cloth.

26:11.900 --> 26:14.867
( grunts )

26:14.867 --> 26:17.067
( singing )

26:28.533 --> 26:31.767
( grunts )
Take this! Go!

26:31.767 --> 26:32.767
( grunting )

26:33.767 --> 26:36.767
( woman singing )

26:50.167 --> 26:52.033
( high-pitched scream )

26:52.033 --> 26:54.633
( operatic wailing )

26:55.733 --> 26:57.633
Ow.

27:00.833 --> 27:02.167
We found them inside.

27:02.167 --> 27:04.333
And they were
going after the stone.

27:04.333 --> 27:05.333
Mm.

27:07.867 --> 27:12.933
- Who are you?
- We protect what you
seek to destroy.

27:12.933 --> 27:14.600
Librarian.

27:16.567 --> 27:18.567
Should we kill them?

27:24.667 --> 27:26.233
They've been gone too long.

27:26.233 --> 27:28.433
We heard the signal,
we know they got the stone,

27:28.433 --> 27:30.100
- Where are they?
- Perhaps the Order
got there first.

27:30.100 --> 27:31.800
Now they have the stone
and our Librarians.

27:31.800 --> 27:34.467
Then they're probably headed
to the final stone as we speak.

27:34.467 --> 27:37.700
- Flynn.
- I'm trying. It's not that easy
to find Nicole's hiding spot.

27:37.700 --> 27:39.433
But you said
they were connected
to the muses.

27:39.433 --> 27:43.400
Yes, but the last muse
is Mneme, the Muse of Memory.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.567
What does that tell us?
That she hid it some place
in the past?

27:45.567 --> 27:47.533
Some place personal?

27:47.533 --> 27:50.267
Tell me where you hid
the final stone.

27:50.267 --> 27:53.100
I already told you
where the other one was.

27:53.100 --> 27:56.500
If you have that,
you don't need the last.

28:00.933 --> 28:03.133
Oh.
( chuckles )

28:06.733 --> 28:10.167
You didn't get it,
did you?

28:10.167 --> 28:14.233
Boy, Librarians just aren't
what they used to be.

28:14.233 --> 28:15.900
Tell me!

28:15.900 --> 28:17.267
- Jenkins: Colonel!
- Flynn: Eve!

28:17.267 --> 28:19.133
- Jenkins: Colonel! Colonel!
- Flynn: Eve!

28:19.133 --> 28:20.300
- Eve!
- Colonel!

28:20.300 --> 28:22.233
Librarians lives
are at stake.

28:22.233 --> 28:24.700
No more riddles,
no more games.

28:24.700 --> 28:26.533
Why should I help you?

28:26.533 --> 28:28.433
Because I'm a Guardian.

28:28.433 --> 28:31.167
Like you. And we both know
protecting the people we love

28:31.167 --> 28:33.100
is the only thing
we give a damn about.

28:33.100 --> 28:36.667
Please, Nicole,
help me save them.

28:41.267 --> 28:42.867
All right.

28:42.867 --> 28:44.900
But not in here.

28:44.900 --> 28:46.600
I'll take you
to the stone myself.

28:46.600 --> 28:49.800
Absolutely not.
She'll run the first
chance she gets.

28:49.800 --> 28:51.767
- Flynn: You don't know
that for sure.
- Jenkins: I know this woman

28:51.767 --> 28:54.167
- is guilty.
- Really? 'Cause I'm
not certain of that.

28:54.167 --> 28:56.200
Mr. Carsen, you cannot
see this clearly.

28:56.200 --> 28:58.467
- You cannot trust her.
- Maybe I can, maybe I can't--

28:58.467 --> 29:01.900
- Enough! Jenkins, open it.
- Colonel.

29:01.900 --> 29:03.400
This is a horrible mistake.

29:03.400 --> 29:06.100
It's a risk
I'm willing to take.

29:06.100 --> 29:08.000
Jenkins:
I can't believe you.

29:24.800 --> 29:26.133
Where are we again?
Lake...?

29:26.133 --> 29:29.333
Maracaibo, Venezula.
But why on Earth

29:29.333 --> 29:31.533
would you hide
the stone here?

29:31.533 --> 29:32.633
Really, Flynn?

29:32.633 --> 29:35.100
I thought you would have
figured it out by now.

29:35.100 --> 29:37.367
- ( thunder crashes )
- Flynn: Of course.

29:37.367 --> 29:39.267
Muse of Memory
was born of lightning.

29:39.267 --> 29:42.533
Lake Maracaibo
is the lightning hotspot
of the world.

29:42.533 --> 29:44.000
Not too bad, eh?

29:44.000 --> 29:46.900
Not bad.

29:46.900 --> 29:50.300
Well, no time
to dilly-dally.

29:50.300 --> 29:53.233
- Follow me.
- ( thunder crashing )

29:53.233 --> 29:55.100
- How much further?
- Not far now.

29:55.100 --> 29:57.033
Do you remember
our adventure in the Amazon?

29:57.033 --> 30:00.133
Ha! How could I forget?
We almost died in a Mayan
death chamber.

30:00.133 --> 30:02.167
We had to waltz
across a field of...

30:02.167 --> 30:03.967
And you were
a horrible dancer.

30:03.967 --> 30:06.767
- Well...
- Good thing it wasn't a tango
or you'd be dead.

30:06.767 --> 30:08.533
Of course.
When we got to Mongolia,

30:08.533 --> 30:10.300
that's when things
got really interesting,

30:10.300 --> 30:11.967
especially
in our hotel room.

30:11.967 --> 30:16.533
( chuckles )
I-- I don't remember.

30:16.533 --> 30:18.600
( thunder crashing )

30:20.300 --> 30:22.500
Stone's hidden underneath.

30:25.900 --> 30:27.467
That's the Machina
Meteorologica.

30:27.467 --> 30:29.133
The first lightning rod
ever designed

30:29.133 --> 30:31.333
by Prokop Divis
in the 1700s.

30:31.333 --> 30:33.233
Nicole:
If you pull the lever,
it'll raise the rod,

30:33.233 --> 30:35.333
and it'll contain the lightning
long enough to get the stone.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.600
Yeah, but you have to get
across the field first.

30:37.600 --> 30:41.033
Without the tree cover,
we're sitting ducks.

30:41.033 --> 30:42.600
Unless you want to...

30:42.600 --> 30:45.700
Oh, no.
I only said I'd take you
to the stone's location.

30:45.700 --> 30:47.100
I never said
I'd get it for you.

30:47.100 --> 30:49.633
- I'll go.
- What? Eve, no, no, no.

30:49.633 --> 30:51.567
It's like the assault course
in basic training.

30:51.567 --> 30:53.633
They used to fire live rounds
at us to keep us frosty.

30:53.633 --> 30:54.933
I was always the fastest.

30:54.933 --> 30:58.233
Okay, but you're
gonna need some help.

31:05.133 --> 31:06.667
What are you looking for?

31:06.667 --> 31:09.100
Mineral ores.
They have a high
metallic content.

31:09.100 --> 31:12.500
I can throw some of these
up in the air and they might
draw away some of the lightning.

31:12.500 --> 31:15.733
There we go.

31:15.733 --> 31:18.733
Excuse me.
Okay.

31:18.733 --> 31:21.900
- Wait for
the seven-second window.
- You can do this.

31:21.900 --> 31:25.000
You can do this.
Ready?

31:25.000 --> 31:27.200
- Go!
- ( grunts )

31:32.367 --> 31:33.367
( grunts )

31:35.333 --> 31:36.333
Whoo!

31:40.733 --> 31:44.800
You two are an amazing team.

31:44.800 --> 31:47.433
( grunting )

31:51.433 --> 31:53.500
Whoo!

31:53.500 --> 31:55.500
( zapping )

31:57.533 --> 31:59.400
Whoo-hoo!
You did it!

31:59.400 --> 32:01.133
- That was amazing!
- Oh!

32:01.133 --> 32:04.500
- Oh, oh, toasty! Wow.
- I'm toasty. Careful.

32:04.500 --> 32:06.433
( grunting )

32:11.400 --> 32:14.467
- I'll take that.
- ( Cillian screams )

32:14.467 --> 32:16.300
Cassandra?

32:18.533 --> 32:20.267
( zapping )

32:22.133 --> 32:24.133
- Cassandra?
- I'm so sorry.

32:24.133 --> 32:26.633
Get back!
Move!

32:26.633 --> 32:30.167
Come on, go!
Move!

32:30.167 --> 32:33.533
"And behold,
from the darkness,

32:33.533 --> 32:35.733
the righteous did arise.

32:35.733 --> 32:41.500
And the false prophets
were cast forever
into eternity."

32:41.500 --> 32:45.567
It's not from the Bible.
I made it up.

32:47.767 --> 32:50.733
The stone?

32:50.733 --> 32:54.633
The stone,
or your friends will die.

32:58.100 --> 32:59.967
Destroying the Library
won't change anything.

32:59.967 --> 33:02.000
People will always
seek out knowledge.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.933
They already have
too much knowledge.

33:04.933 --> 33:07.200
Too much information.

33:07.200 --> 33:09.667
People don't know
what to believe.

33:09.667 --> 33:11.600
Once the Library
is destroyed,

33:11.600 --> 33:17.067
they'll believe only in us,
the Order of Shadows.

33:17.067 --> 33:19.700
Wisdom is not the key,
my child.

33:19.700 --> 33:22.333
Ignorance is bliss.

33:38.633 --> 33:39.667
What's wrong?

33:39.667 --> 33:41.467
Knowledge, Monsignor.

33:41.467 --> 33:43.500
In your quest to destroy it,
you've forgotten you might

33:43.500 --> 33:45.433
actually need some
to make the stones work.

33:45.433 --> 33:47.000
Don't you
just love the irony?

33:47.000 --> 33:50.867
So why don't you tell me
how to make them work?

33:50.867 --> 33:53.700
That's for a Librarian to know,
and the last time I checked,

33:53.700 --> 33:55.433
you are no Librarian.

33:55.433 --> 33:58.633
I will.
I'll show you how
the stones work.

33:58.633 --> 34:02.233
I'm not a Librarian,
but after 500 years,

34:02.233 --> 34:04.467
- you pick up a few things.
- Nicole, no.

34:04.467 --> 34:10.233
Sorry, Flynn,
but the world is a better place
with the Library not in it.

34:19.800 --> 34:23.000
( zapping )

34:28.900 --> 34:30.333
Why did you bring her?

34:30.333 --> 34:33.133
It was the only way
to find the stone and you.

34:41.333 --> 34:43.033
Jenkins said
we couldn't trust her.

34:43.033 --> 34:45.433
- Boy, is he going to flip--
- Enough with Jenkins.

34:45.433 --> 34:47.100
The Library
is gonna implode.

35:11.033 --> 35:13.800
We have to get past
these guys and deactivate
those stones.

35:13.800 --> 35:16.367
Any ideas?
Flynn?

35:16.367 --> 35:18.300
Cassandra,
double check
my calculations.

35:18.300 --> 35:21.333
43-degree angle,
assuming for 120-foot-
per-second velocity?

35:21.333 --> 35:23.867
I'd go with 44 degrees
to be safe.

35:23.867 --> 35:26.033
( sobbing )

35:26.033 --> 35:29.800
Father.
Father, please.
Hear my confession.

35:29.800 --> 35:32.767
- Get back.
- Father, I've sinned.

35:32.767 --> 35:35.367
Cleanse my soul, Father!
( grunts )

35:35.367 --> 35:38.067
( grunting )

35:38.067 --> 35:40.467
Nice try,
but you failed.

35:40.467 --> 35:42.400
Did I?

35:42.400 --> 35:43.733
Ha!

35:45.767 --> 35:48.400
( screams )

35:48.400 --> 35:50.400
Come on!

35:50.400 --> 35:52.167
( grunting )

35:53.533 --> 35:55.900
Step back!

35:55.900 --> 35:58.333
I have waited for centuries
for this moment.

35:58.333 --> 36:00.100
Do you think I'm gonna
let you stop it?

36:00.100 --> 36:02.000
- Hey!
- No!

36:02.000 --> 36:04.233
I need all four stones.

36:04.233 --> 36:08.167
If you throw that in,
it will be lost forever.

36:08.167 --> 36:10.033
And the others
will be useless.

36:10.033 --> 36:12.767
That's what I was
counting on.

36:12.767 --> 36:14.333
( grunts )

36:14.333 --> 36:15.667
No! No!

36:25.533 --> 36:27.767
Flynn.

36:27.767 --> 36:29.467
( screaming )

36:29.467 --> 36:31.000
Nicole!

36:32.600 --> 36:34.767
- Nicole!
- The vortex!

36:34.767 --> 36:37.433
Without the power
from the fourth stone,
it's collapsing.

36:37.433 --> 36:39.900
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!
You're gonna go in after her?

36:39.900 --> 36:42.033
I'm not losing her.
Not again.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.800
When you feel a tug,
pull hard.

36:43.800 --> 36:46.600
No! If it collapses
while you're on the other side,
you'll be trapped!

36:48.233 --> 36:51.967
Flynn! The vortex!
It's collapsing!

36:51.967 --> 36:54.067
We need to find a way
to boost the power

36:54.067 --> 36:55.833
to make up for
the missing stone.

36:55.833 --> 36:58.533
The lightning.
We'll harness the power
from the lightning.

36:58.533 --> 37:02.067
- Are you crazy?
- Maybe, but each of the stones
has an electrical charge,

37:02.067 --> 37:05.000
either positive or negative,
and the lightning has
a negative charge.

37:05.000 --> 37:07.267
If we can send the electricity
from the lightning

37:07.267 --> 37:09.833
through a wire
and attach it to
a negatively charged stone,

37:09.833 --> 37:12.100
we can boost the power!

37:12.100 --> 37:13.600
- Go!
- Just like jumping a car.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.733
Yeah, yeah,
but which stone
do you-- you--

37:15.733 --> 37:18.533
put jumper cables
on the wrong terminal,
you blow up the entire car!

37:18.533 --> 37:22.033
Leave it to me, all right?
Go out there and get ready!

37:22.033 --> 37:24.333
All right.
Helios.

37:28.500 --> 37:30.000
Selene.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.333
Selene, moon goddess.

37:33.300 --> 37:36.400
Why am I bloody
doing this?

37:36.400 --> 37:37.733
Helios.

37:37.733 --> 37:40.400
These two blocks are the same.
Helios is the sun god.

37:40.400 --> 37:44.000
Sun is positive,
moon is negative.
It's this one.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.200
- Okay!
- ( grunts )

37:52.200 --> 37:54.367
Watch your hands.
Ready!

37:55.633 --> 37:56.933
( zapping )

37:56.933 --> 37:59.567
Ahh!

37:59.567 --> 38:01.633
( zapping )

38:05.733 --> 38:08.567
- It's working!
- ( zapping )

38:08.567 --> 38:11.400
It's Flynn!

38:11.400 --> 38:13.600
( grunting )

38:13.600 --> 38:15.167
( zapping )

38:18.600 --> 38:21.333
Flynn, are you all right?

38:25.367 --> 38:27.933
Thank you.
You saved the Library.

38:27.933 --> 38:31.133
No.
I saved him.

38:32.433 --> 38:35.633
Protect the people
we love, right?

38:35.633 --> 38:37.933
- ( exhales )
- ( groans )

38:37.933 --> 38:40.733
What do you want to do
with these guys?

38:40.733 --> 38:44.600
Tie 'em up.
I'll put a call into DOSA.
They owe us a favor.

38:44.600 --> 38:47.900
Well, after five minutes
in an interdimensional vortex,

38:47.900 --> 38:51.867
I need a drink.
I think Nicole w--

38:51.867 --> 38:53.400
Nicole?

39:02.667 --> 39:07.467
So, I'm still confused.
Was she innocent or not?

39:07.467 --> 39:10.867
You saw what Nicole did.
She tricked him into
opening up the vortex,

39:10.867 --> 39:12.500
disposing of the stone.

39:12.500 --> 39:15.433
Yeah, but she said
that was to protect Flynn,
not the Library.

39:15.433 --> 39:18.733
Indeed. She could be
plotting her next act
of revenge as we speak.

39:18.733 --> 39:22.133
Don't forget, she ran.
Who runs if they're not guilty?

39:22.133 --> 39:25.300
I don't know. Maybe people
who are unjustly incarcerated
for a hundred years.

39:25.300 --> 39:28.633
- Oh.
- Maybe she ran
because she'd had enough.

39:28.633 --> 39:31.300
All the years
of being a Guardian,
all the sacrifices.

39:31.300 --> 39:34.733
Maybe she just wanted
a little time to reevaluate
everything.

39:37.467 --> 39:39.800
Yes, well,

39:39.800 --> 39:43.867
we may never know the truth
about Ms. Noone's actions,

39:43.867 --> 39:45.533
but what I do know

39:45.533 --> 39:48.900
is that there are 89 days,
3 hours, and 22 seconds left

39:48.900 --> 39:50.433
until the next
vernal equinox,

39:50.433 --> 39:52.967
which means we must
start rehearsing for...

39:52.967 --> 39:55.200
All:
The Tethering Ceremony!

39:55.200 --> 39:57.533
- Come on, man,
- The Library will
not tether itself.

39:57.533 --> 39:59.533
Mush! Mush!

40:02.033 --> 40:04.233
Everything okay?

40:05.867 --> 40:08.433
Yeah.
Just a little tired.

40:08.433 --> 40:10.600
No, I mean us.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.133
Are we okay?

40:13.767 --> 40:15.067
If you're talking
about Nicole,

40:15.067 --> 40:16.967
I don't have any feelings
for Nicole.

40:16.967 --> 40:19.433
I'm not talking about
our relationship, Flynn.

40:19.433 --> 40:22.233
We're about to make
a huge commitment,

40:22.233 --> 40:24.500
tethering to the Library.

40:24.500 --> 40:27.967
And it's forever.

40:27.967 --> 40:30.233
Are you still on board?

40:32.267 --> 40:35.000
I was, but after everything
Nicole said--

40:35.000 --> 40:36.967
what if what she said
about the Library is true?

40:36.967 --> 40:39.567
What if we can't trust
the institution?

40:41.767 --> 40:46.333
An institution
is only as good
as the people in it.

40:46.333 --> 40:48.700
That's us.

40:48.700 --> 40:50.700
Trust us.

40:55.967 --> 40:58.233
- Yeah.
- Jenkins: Colonel!
Mr. Carsen!

40:58.233 --> 41:02.633
( groans )
He's like nightmare
wedding planner.

41:04.900 --> 41:06.567
- You coming?
- Yes, yes.

41:06.567 --> 41:08.600
Actually, I should put
these cornerstones away.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.600
I'll meet you there.

41:50.200 --> 41:53.367
( music playing )
