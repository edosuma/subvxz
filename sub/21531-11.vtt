WEBVTT

00:06.607 --> 00:11.179
ROGER:
Tonight, from Stage Seventeen
in Studio City, California...

00:11.212 --> 00:16.117
JIM BURROWS: In five,
four, three, two, one...

00:16.150 --> 00:17.418
We are live!

00:26.560 --> 00:29.563
Phil, Marlo,
welcome to my home.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.565
Wouldn't be my birthday
without you.

00:31.599 --> 00:34.235
Ah, Marlo, look at you.

00:34.268 --> 00:37.305
Vintage Sixties
with a plunging neck.

00:39.107 --> 00:40.441
Oh, and I like
your dress, too.
It's cute.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.545
ROSARIO: How's
your birthday party going?

00:44.578 --> 00:46.314
Oh, I'm having a ball.

00:46.347 --> 00:49.817
How's selling Chiclets
in my bathroom going?

00:49.850 --> 00:51.419
Can't complain.

00:51.452 --> 00:55.423
Yoko Ono gave me $2
for orange Tic-Tacs.

00:55.456 --> 00:57.291
I think she likes me.

00:57.325 --> 01:00.561
Oh, honey,
she definitely likes you!

01:00.594 --> 01:02.563
Yeah, I just passed her
in the hallway,

01:02.596 --> 01:05.233
and she asked me if she
could buy the big statue

01:05.266 --> 01:06.500
of Sitting Bull
that's in my bathroom.

01:09.370 --> 01:10.438
Hi!

01:10.471 --> 01:13.141
Karen, you are here.

01:13.174 --> 01:15.143
When they said you were
in the little girl's room,

01:15.176 --> 01:18.379
I just assumed they meant
the room where you keep
the maid's children.

01:18.412 --> 01:22.550
This is
the most amazing party
I have ever been to.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.452
Celebrities everywhere.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.654
You know the best thing
to do at a party full
of famous people?

01:26.687 --> 01:29.357
Treat them normally
and let them enjoy
their evening?

01:29.390 --> 01:31.625
No. Play ass-tag.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.597
The person who touches
the most celebrity ass

01:36.630 --> 01:38.599
without them knowing
wins.

01:40.268 --> 01:42.703
I just got Liza Minnelli.

01:42.736 --> 01:46.140
I think
I broke her hip again.

01:46.174 --> 01:47.375
Now, I know you said
not to bring anything,

01:47.408 --> 01:49.643
but I went ahead and
made my award-winning

01:49.677 --> 01:51.679
Charleston Harbor
Pickled Shrimp.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.414
You didn't win an award.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.882
You said,
"Look what I made for Karen."

01:54.915 --> 01:55.649
And I said,
"What do you want, a medal?"

01:58.686 --> 02:01.455
Great.
Pickled shrimp.

02:01.489 --> 02:05.326
Happy Rockefeller
is gonna be farting
all night long.

02:05.359 --> 02:07.228
Hey, trust me,
people are gonna love it.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.230
It's a sophisticated,
elegant dish

02:09.263 --> 02:11.465
for a sophisticated,
elegant evening.

02:11.499 --> 02:12.466
I gotta piss.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.371
Are you sitting down?

02:24.445 --> 02:26.547
Ah! There you are.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.382
You are not gonna
believe who's here.

02:28.416 --> 02:30.251
Antoine.

02:30.284 --> 02:33.221
Remember him?
Thank you, dear.

02:33.254 --> 02:36.490
We had that horrible breakup
when he cheated on me.

02:36.524 --> 02:37.458
Literally on me.

02:40.528 --> 02:41.595
I woke up
and he was having sex

02:41.629 --> 02:44.332
with another man
on top of me.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.934
They had no idea
I was sleeping
under the covers.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.569
Since the whole thing
played out

02:48.602 --> 02:51.205
in a display window
at Bed Bath & Beyond,

02:51.239 --> 02:53.541
I was the laughing stock
of that weird part
of Sixth Avenue.

02:53.574 --> 02:56.377
So now we meet again,

02:56.410 --> 02:59.280
and I'm a huge success,

02:59.313 --> 03:01.482
while he's serving
goat cheese tartlets

03:01.515 --> 03:04.752
to something
called Gore Vidal.

03:04.785 --> 03:07.555
I'm gonna go rub it
in his face.

03:07.588 --> 03:11.259
Literally, in his face!
Happy birthday, Kar'.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.593
Oh, Karen,

03:12.626 --> 03:14.762
I am so happy
that you decided
to throw yourself

03:14.795 --> 03:17.265
a big birthday party
this year.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.267
It definitely beats
the three of us
dragging you down

03:19.300 --> 03:21.402
to Chinatown every year
for a "little" dinner.

03:21.435 --> 03:22.770
I love Chinatown.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.306
You can get
a bag of zippers
this big for a dollar.

03:27.775 --> 03:30.010
I hand them out
to poor kids.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.980
Aw, the look
on their little faces

03:33.013 --> 03:35.215
as they zip and unzip
their new toy.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.788
Yeah, well, we should
get back out there.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.723
I don't wanna miss
a minute of the party.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.425
I'm gonna try and get
Susan Sarandon

03:44.458 --> 03:47.395
and Tim Robbins
in a double.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.263
When are those two gonna
get married already?

03:49.297 --> 03:50.163
I mean, we get it,
you're liberal!

03:50.197 --> 03:52.833
( laughs )
Well, thanks
for coming, kids.

03:52.866 --> 03:56.504
Really.
I'm just so glad
that you're all here.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.506
What the hell
are they doing here?

04:00.441 --> 04:03.611
I specifically told you
not to invite them.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.778
I'm sorry, lady.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.847
I sent them
invitations by mistake.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.417
Oh, yeah?

04:09.450 --> 04:10.784
I think the real mistake

04:10.818 --> 04:12.720
was when your father
spotted your mother

04:12.753 --> 04:14.355
across a crowded swamp.

04:17.458 --> 04:21.362
Dragged her back
to his hut and made you.

04:21.395 --> 04:23.731
I never should have shown
you our home movies.

04:23.764 --> 04:27.901
( theme song )

04:31.872 --> 04:34.475
How many of these am I
supposed to take again?

04:34.508 --> 04:36.043
( dice clicking )

04:36.076 --> 04:40.881
( dice rolling )

04:40.914 --> 04:41.982
Ah, yes! Eight.

04:45.386 --> 04:46.920
That's it.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.889
I am no longer watching
The Today Show.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.958
And not just because
Katie Couric has
so many highlights,

04:50.991 --> 04:51.959
it's like looking
directly into the sun!

04:53.894 --> 04:55.829
Matt Lauer
has insulted me.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.931
What happened, honey?

04:57.965 --> 04:58.999
Did he make fun
of your forehead?

05:00.601 --> 05:02.436
Or your beady eyes?
Your gay mouth?

05:02.470 --> 05:04.004
What was it?

05:04.037 --> 05:05.873
I saw him take a bite

05:05.906 --> 05:07.107
of one of my Charleston
Harbor pickled shrimp,

05:07.140 --> 05:08.576
make a big stupid face,

05:08.609 --> 05:10.444
and then throw it
behind the fireplace tools.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.112
That's what you were doing

05:12.145 --> 05:14.882
on your hands and knees
in front of the mantle.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.850
I thought you met someone
and were doing

05:16.884 --> 05:18.652
the gay presenting
of the butt ritual.

05:21.088 --> 05:25.125
Karen, that only
happens in your
disgusting imagination.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.127
And Tuesday nights
at Baboon Bar.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.129
No, I was retrieving
the shrimp,

05:29.162 --> 05:31.699
so I could shame Lauer
in front of his cronies,

05:31.732 --> 05:33.601
and then I stood up
and I ripped my pants.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.469
Please tell me
that you have
a sewing kit here.

05:37.104 --> 05:39.473
Oh!

05:39.507 --> 05:41.475
I didn't know anyone
was in here, I'm sorry.

05:41.509 --> 05:42.943
- Oh, hey, Mattie!
- Hey, Kar', how ya doin'?

05:42.976 --> 05:44.678
Do you mind if I grab
a mint or something?

05:44.712 --> 05:48.148
I have this, blah,
nasty taste in my mouth.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.618
- Nasty?
- Yeah.

05:50.651 --> 05:53.554
What you have, sir,
is a lazy palate.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.489
And, by the way...

05:55.523 --> 05:59.059
where in the world are
Matt Lauer's manners?

05:59.092 --> 06:01.662
- Oh, oh, hi!
- Hi! How are you?

06:01.695 --> 06:02.996
Oh, oops!
( chuckles )

06:08.769 --> 06:10.137
You already got me.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.506
Ah, damn it.

06:12.540 --> 06:16.009
Wow, sounds like
you kids are havin'
kind of a bad night.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.478
- Maybe you should go home.
- WILL: Oh, come on.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.413
No! We're having
a great time.

06:19.447 --> 06:21.014
Fine.

06:21.048 --> 06:24.117
Well, I'm gonna go open
my presents from Stan.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.119
Every year
he hides my big gift

06:26.153 --> 06:28.622
in the overhang
above his bikini area.

06:30.624 --> 06:33.727
Check it out.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.664
I just touched Philip
Seymour Hoffman's ass,

06:36.697 --> 06:37.965
and he grabbed my boob.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.169
That man just
got nominated
for a Golden Globe,

06:42.202 --> 06:43.637
and then he grabbed
one of mine.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.074
What do you think
of that?

06:47.107 --> 06:49.443
I think "globe"
is a little generous.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.616
And he got
some chicken pesto
on your dress.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.952
( gasps )
Oh, no!

06:58.986 --> 07:03.457
I kept--I kept the tags
on so I could return it
tomorrow! Oh, my gosh.

07:03.491 --> 07:06.494
I have got to get cold water
onto this right away.

07:06.527 --> 07:10.798
Oh, my God,
this is the biggest,
most obvious stain ever.

07:19.607 --> 07:24.011
Wow, I guess
you actually
can be too gay.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.581
Some of yours
is leaking out.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.483
Yeah.

07:29.517 --> 07:32.720
Antoine and I
decided to talk.

07:32.753 --> 07:37.224
So I sit down
on this beautiful
three-tiered chair,

07:37.257 --> 07:39.760
when all of a sudden,
after a couple seconds,

07:39.793 --> 07:42.730
pfft, the whole thing
gives out!

07:42.763 --> 07:44.064
You know what
it turns out it was?

07:46.066 --> 07:47.701
Karen's birthday cake?

07:47.735 --> 07:50.838
Oh, I was gonna say
"antique cake chair,"

07:50.871 --> 07:54.041
but yours
makes more sense.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.142
Anyway,
Rosie's comin' in

07:55.175 --> 07:56.577
with a clean change
of clothes

07:56.610 --> 07:58.145
while I take
a quick shower.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.847
Why don't you get
undressed out here?

07:59.880 --> 08:04.585
And leave myself exposed
for Will to jump me?

08:04.618 --> 08:06.286
No, thanks.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.622
Oh, wait.

08:08.656 --> 08:11.525
Did Philip Seymour Hoffman
have some of my pickled
shrimp on his plate?

08:11.559 --> 08:13.727
I ask because it was right
next to the chicken pesto,

08:13.761 --> 08:15.262
so it would only make sense--

08:15.295 --> 08:18.298
No, no. No one likes
your pickled shrimp.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.633
You know why?

08:19.667 --> 08:22.069
Pickled. Shrimp.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.782
Yeah, say
whatever you want,
they're gonna catch on.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.850
Pretty sure, pretty soon,
everywhere you look,

08:36.884 --> 08:38.185
you're gonna see
pickled shrimp!

08:38.218 --> 08:40.187
Well, well, well...

08:42.089 --> 08:44.825
I walk in on a naked man,

08:44.858 --> 08:46.827
a man in his underpants,
and a woman...

08:46.860 --> 08:48.562
who needs to leave.

08:49.897 --> 08:52.165
Beverly,
this isn't a good time.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.701
And I'm saying
it could be.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.805
Get out!

08:57.838 --> 09:00.708
Oh, settle down, woman.
Look at y'all.

09:00.741 --> 09:04.311
I've never witnessed such
inappropriate behavior.

09:09.249 --> 09:12.586
It's no wonder
Karen's never invited
you to her birthday party.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.823
What?
This is the first time she's
ever thrown herself a party.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.859
Oh, my.
Have I been indiscreet?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.728
'Cause I'd hate to be
the one to tell you

09:20.761 --> 09:23.196
Karen's been having
this party for ten years.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.297
Really hate it.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.368
Really.
Ten years.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.638
Hate it.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.741
I can't believe it.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.342
This is impossible!

09:35.375 --> 09:38.245
All these years,
and she's been lying to us!

09:38.278 --> 09:40.313
It's worse than that!

09:40.347 --> 09:42.750
Karen uses Costco shampoo!

09:49.422 --> 09:52.359
This is unbelievable.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.728
All these years, we've been
taking Karen on her birthday

09:54.762 --> 09:56.697
because we felt bad
she didn't have a party.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.999
And all along,
she was having
this huge thing

09:59.032 --> 10:00.067
behind our backs.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.168
I know.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.341
I hate when people
have huge things

10:08.375 --> 10:09.342
behind my back.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.082
Usually.
( chuckles )

10:16.717 --> 10:19.653
Rosie, why has Karen had
this party for ten years

10:19.687 --> 10:21.388
and never invited us
until now?

10:21.421 --> 10:23.123
You weren't invited
to this one, either.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.092
I screwed up
and put you on the list.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.294
JACK:
It's outrageous!

10:27.327 --> 10:29.663
Why wouldn't she want
the three of us here?

10:32.165 --> 10:34.134
You weren't invited
because of one person,

10:34.167 --> 10:35.703
and one person only.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.137
KAREN: ( on intercom )
Rosie?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.774
This is Rosie.
Come back.

10:42.710 --> 10:45.278
Get out here,
I wanna introduce
you to Diane Sawyer.

10:45.312 --> 10:48.749
( gasps )
I'm thrilled!
She's my idol!

10:48.782 --> 10:50.250
We're thinkin'
of doin' a trade.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.185
and she wants to check
your head for lice.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.057
At least
I have hair, lady.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.328
One person?
What does that mean?

11:01.361 --> 11:03.263
Well, obviously, it means
she's embarrassed by one of us.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.398
And she can't just
invite the other two,
so none of us get to come.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.400
Well, who is
she embarrassed by?

11:11.438 --> 11:13.841
Gee, I wonder who,
Mrs. Roper.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.847
Yeah, well.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.783
I don't get
that reference
to Three's Company.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.452
While you two geniuses
figure this out,

11:25.485 --> 11:27.187
I'm gonna go tell Karen
that it's okay

11:27.220 --> 11:28.889
if I'm the only one
she invites next year.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.091
'Cause it's obviously not me
she's embarrassed by.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.231
In case anyone
was wondering,

11:38.265 --> 11:40.868
Beverly Leslie comes up
exactly to my penis.

11:44.237 --> 11:47.174
You still sure
you're not the one
she's embarrassed by?

11:47.207 --> 11:49.276
You basically just
showed a leprechaun
your pot of gold.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.848
You told John McCain
you loved him

11:54.882 --> 11:56.249
in Cheaper by the Dozen.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.490
I fooled around with Antoine
on top of all the coats.

12:03.523 --> 12:05.859
If she's embarrassed
by anybody, it's me.

12:05.893 --> 12:06.927
Wait...

12:08.962 --> 12:10.530
Anyway,
it's obviously you, Grace,

12:10.563 --> 12:11.865
because,
you know, you're a woman.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.233
that's always
a little embarrassing.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.102
You know what I hear
when you talk?

12:15.135 --> 12:17.805
Blah-blah-blah-
blah-blah!

12:17.838 --> 12:19.506
You know what I see
when you talk?

12:19.539 --> 12:21.274
William Hurt in a wig!

12:23.443 --> 12:26.847
You are both
embarrassing!

12:26.880 --> 12:29.249
If I had a party,
I wouldn't invite
either of you!

12:29.282 --> 12:31.218
I wouldn't wanna go,
'cause everything
would be pickled!

12:34.454 --> 12:37.390
Do people not know
how long it takes

12:37.424 --> 12:38.859
to pickle something?

12:38.892 --> 12:40.527
I had to buy a barrel,
for God's sake.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.229
Those aren't
easy to find!

12:42.262 --> 12:43.396
You'd think
they'd sell 'em
at Crate and Barrel,

12:43.430 --> 12:44.431
But guess what?
They don't.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.267
They don't sell
crates, either.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.936
Hey, next time
save me the trip

12:48.969 --> 12:51.905
and name your store
Ottomans and Wicker Crap!

12:57.878 --> 13:01.314
You're...
a pompous boor, Will.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.253
What did you say to me?

13:07.487 --> 13:08.488
I said...

13:11.925 --> 13:15.829
you are
a pompous boor.

13:17.564 --> 13:18.365
( chuckles )

13:57.070 --> 14:00.240
You are so dead!

14:07.280 --> 14:09.849
Stop it! Stop it!

14:10.683 --> 14:11.851
Stop!

14:17.457 --> 14:18.858
Stop it, hey, hey, no!

14:21.328 --> 14:23.997
We are behaving
like children.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.501
You're right.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.403
Hey!

14:32.539 --> 14:33.974
( screams )

14:34.007 --> 14:35.642
This is not
a good weapon.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.911
Ah! Grace!

14:37.945 --> 14:39.546
You got Visine in my eye!

14:41.681 --> 14:42.649
Oh.

14:47.955 --> 14:51.291
( all panting and coughing )

15:19.319 --> 15:20.320
What--

15:25.725 --> 15:27.460
Great.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.129
Now I'm gonna have
to climb back on the roof

15:29.162 --> 15:30.930
and load 'em all back
into the hatch.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.335
Rosie! Get in here!
Clean this up!

15:35.368 --> 15:38.071
ROSARIO:
Okay, everybody clear out.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.439
This'll only take a second.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.609
( Grace panting )

15:42.642 --> 15:43.743
Shouldn't
somebody help her?

15:43.776 --> 15:44.744
( cleaner humming )

15:44.777 --> 15:46.046
Nobody helps her.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.348
She makes
$350,000 a year!

15:50.350 --> 15:52.986
What kind
of prescription plan
are you on, by the way?

16:05.765 --> 16:10.070
I think it's the, uh,
"sneak a truck across
the Canadian border" plan.

16:15.508 --> 16:18.611
Man, this is even harder
than cleaning up

16:18.645 --> 16:21.148
that stinky,
slimy pile of shrimp

16:21.181 --> 16:24.517
someone dumped
in the ficus tree.

16:24.551 --> 16:27.754
( humming stops )
Okay, all done.

16:48.675 --> 16:52.545
I'm sorry it took so long.
I had to change the bag.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.815
- WILL: Wow.
- KAREN: I know.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.784
Isn't she fantastic?

16:57.817 --> 17:01.388
Honey, when I free you,
you're getting 42 acres
and a mule.

17:01.421 --> 17:04.591
No, a pony.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.426
No, a cat.

17:06.459 --> 17:07.660
Nah, I'm keeping the land.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.162
You get a trick cat
that can ride a pony.

17:09.196 --> 17:09.829
You'll make a fortune.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.664
Get out.

17:11.698 --> 17:15.602
Now, what the hell
happened in here?

17:15.635 --> 17:17.137
Karen...

17:19.572 --> 17:22.542
why have you never
invited us to this party?

17:24.177 --> 17:26.213
Oh...
( chuckles )

17:26.246 --> 17:28.815
You found out about that.

17:28.848 --> 17:31.651
Well, this is
only the second year
that I've had a party--

17:31.684 --> 17:33.586
We know it's been ten!

17:33.620 --> 17:36.123
Oh...
( chuckles )

17:36.156 --> 17:39.159
You found out about that.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.561
Well, the reason
that I did invite you
this year--

17:41.594 --> 17:43.463
We know Rosie
invited us by mistake.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.500
Oh...
( chuckles )

17:47.534 --> 17:49.869
You found out about that.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.838
Karen, come on!

17:51.871 --> 17:53.873
Rosie told us
you didn't invite us
because of one person.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.143
- Who is it? It's Will, right?
- It's not me, it's you.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.211
( all arguing )

17:58.245 --> 18:00.713
All right, all right,
all right, it's me!

18:00.747 --> 18:05.152
It's me, okay?
The one person is me.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.654
You know how every year
for my birthday,

18:07.687 --> 18:11.558
you people take me out
to some crappy dinner?

18:11.591 --> 18:14.194
( sighs )
Well...

18:14.227 --> 18:16.829
I guess I was afraid
that if you found out
about this party,

18:16.863 --> 18:18.598
you wouldn't do that
anymore,

18:18.631 --> 18:20.833
and that crappy dinner

18:20.867 --> 18:23.203
is the thing I look
forward to the most.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.740
That's my real birthday.

18:27.774 --> 18:31.611
Oh, Karen,
that's so sweet.

18:31.644 --> 18:34.647
I've only ever been
90% sure you were human.

18:38.218 --> 18:41.854
But, lady, you--you
just bumped it up to 95.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.724
GRACE:
And to think that we--

18:44.757 --> 18:47.660
we thought that you
were embarrassed of us.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.865
Now, come on!

18:52.899 --> 18:56.669
How in the world
could I ever be
embarrassed by you?

19:03.543 --> 19:05.612
Honey, ya got a tampon
in your hair.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.787
But if you were worried
we'd cancel our dinner,

19:14.821 --> 19:16.589
why didn't you just
say something?

19:16.623 --> 19:18.925
Well, I'm a proud woman,
Jackie.

19:18.958 --> 19:22.662
Sometimes it's hard for me
to talk about my feelings.

19:22.695 --> 19:25.932
Plus, I'm high
most of the times,
so there's that.

19:25.965 --> 19:29.536
If you want,
we could still do
dinner tomorrow night.

19:29.569 --> 19:30.737
Oh, that'd be nice.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.639
Happy birthday, Kar'.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.542
KAREN: Oh!
Okay, don't, don't!

19:35.575 --> 19:37.244
Okay,
I can't wait any longer.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.679
I need to tinkle.

19:39.712 --> 19:42.282
GRACE:
Are you sitting down?

19:42.315 --> 19:44.717
WILL: See?

19:51.458 --> 19:54.394
ROGER: And now the cast
of Will & Grace!

19:54.427 --> 19:56.496
As himself, Matt Lauer!

19:56.529 --> 19:58.798
( audience cheering )

19:58.831 --> 20:02.402
As Beverly Leslie,
Leslie Jordan!

20:02.435 --> 20:06.439
As Rosario,
Shelley Morrison!

20:06.473 --> 20:11.378
As Jack McFarland,
Sean Hayes!

20:11.411 --> 20:15.548
As Karen Walker,
Megan Mullally!

20:15.582 --> 20:17.817
And as Will and Grace,
ladies and gentlemen,

20:17.850 --> 20:21.721
Eric McCormack
and Debra Messing!

20:21.754 --> 20:23.690
Ladies and gentlemen,
once again,

20:23.723 --> 20:26.559
a round of applause
for the cast of Will & Grace!

20:26.593 --> 20:28.728
( audience cheering )
