00:04.460 --> 00:05.210
[upbeat music]

00:08.330 --> 00:11.080
[all]
Happy birthday!

00:11.080 --> 00:12.460
[horn blares]

00:12.460 --> 00:14.290
Birthday
breakfast burrito.

00:14.290 --> 00:15.960
-Your favorite.
-Ho ho ho.

00:15.960 --> 00:18.960
And special
birthday-blend coffee.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.670
I even put in some of
that blueberry sweetener

00:20.670 --> 00:21.880
you pretend not to like.

00:21.880 --> 00:24.750
-[chuckles]
-And the mug is clean...

00:24.750 --> 00:27.460
-...ish.
-Wow. Thanks, guys.

00:27.460 --> 00:28.620
You didn't have to go
to all this trouble.

00:28.620 --> 00:30.460
We really did.
It's time you get

00:30.460 --> 00:32.040
the birthday
celebration
you deserve.

00:32.040 --> 00:33.250
What do you mean?
You guys always

00:33.250 --> 00:34.330
give me a good birthday.

00:34.330 --> 00:35.960
Drop the act, Dad.

00:35.960 --> 00:37.330
We all know
you're the last one

00:37.330 --> 00:38.920
in a month full
of Diaz birthdays.

00:38.920 --> 00:41.380
[Harley] By the time
we get to yours...

00:43.120 --> 00:45.880
We're out of coffee.
Sorry.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.750
Wait a minute. [gasps]
It's your birthday!

00:51.120 --> 00:53.330
[sighs]

00:55.790 --> 00:57.710
You deserve more than
hand-me-down coffee.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.460
Seeing Aidan bond
with his dad

01:00.460 --> 01:02.420
made us remember
how lucky we are.

01:02.420 --> 01:05.330
That's why today is all
about appreciating you.

01:05.330 --> 01:08.170
A re-appreciation,
if you will.

01:08.170 --> 01:09.710
And...

01:09.710 --> 01:11.380
You have all day to relax.

01:11.380 --> 01:13.120
And to show you
we mean that,

01:13.120 --> 01:14.580
Lewie and Beast
are at camp.

01:14.580 --> 01:15.920
You do love me.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.380
Plus, Mom and I
are heading down

01:17.380 --> 01:18.540
to the Bait and Bite

01:18.540 --> 01:19.750
to take care of
all the essentials

01:19.750 --> 01:20.960
and put up a sign
that says

01:20.960 --> 01:22.580
the store is closed
for the day.

01:22.580 --> 01:24.620
That way you can just
sit around and do nothing.

01:24.620 --> 01:27.210
I find the couch is nice
this time of year.

01:27.210 --> 01:29.500
And don't worry about dinner.
We've got it covered.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.380
BunBurger,
like always.

01:31.380 --> 01:32.500
Dad, you're not getting it.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.420
Mom and Ethan
have something

01:34.420 --> 01:36.500
a little more
exciting planned.

01:36.500 --> 01:37.670
Right?

01:38.710 --> 01:41.460
Uh, sure. Yes.

01:41.460 --> 01:44.210
We're doing
a big surprise dinner

01:44.210 --> 01:47.120
that is definitely
not BunBurger.

01:47.120 --> 01:49.420
Yeah, but it's
a huge surprise

01:49.420 --> 01:50.960
for us all.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.500
And because relaxing
is most fun

01:52.500 --> 01:54.170
when other people are working,

01:54.170 --> 01:56.830
the girls present our gift.

01:56.830 --> 01:58.120
The wheel of mañana.

01:58.120 --> 01:59.620
All the things you say

01:59.620 --> 02:01.120
you'll get to mañana.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.540
Everything
you've been avoiding.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.170
The worst of the worst.

02:04.170 --> 02:06.250
Give it a spin
and whatever it lands on,

02:06.250 --> 02:07.620
it'll become our nightmare.

02:07.620 --> 02:09.420
Happy birthday.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.460
Hey, Harls, I think you might
need a new protractor.

02:11.460 --> 02:13.170
These look like
they're different sizes.

02:13.170 --> 02:15.460
Oh, really?
Oh, my mistake.

02:15.460 --> 02:17.380
Not a mistake.

02:17.380 --> 02:19.500
I made the hard ones
thinner on purpose,

02:19.500 --> 02:22.000
so the probability of landing
on the most hated chores

02:22.000 --> 02:23.960
is a little less probable.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.710
I knew there was a reason
I took AP Statistics.

02:26.710 --> 02:29.460
Ooh! Knock down
the spiderwebs
in the crawl space!

02:29.460 --> 02:31.000
Catch the mouse that
lives in the mailbox?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.500
I don't know which one
to root for.

02:35.670 --> 02:39.380
Come on, replace
fire alarm batteries.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.080
[Daphne]
Clean out the garage?

02:47.080 --> 02:48.080
[Harley chuckles]

02:50.460 --> 02:52.460
Next time something
needs to be rigged,

02:52.460 --> 02:55.170

being held up by a spiderweb.

03:56.330 --> 03:58.080
When's the last time
the garage was cleaned?

03:58.080 --> 03:59.750
Ugh!
And more importantly,

03:59.750 --> 04:01.250
how big is that spider?

04:01.250 --> 04:03.580
You don't get a garage
to keep it tidy.

04:03.580 --> 04:05.170
You get it to cram junk in.

04:05.170 --> 04:06.960
[chuckles] Well,
then top-notch work.

04:06.960 --> 04:09.580
Are we keeping
this ugly radio?

04:09.580 --> 04:12.250
[Tom] That ugly radio is
our old answering machine--

04:12.250 --> 04:14.380
kinda like voicemail 1.0.

04:14.380 --> 04:16.000
Oh, great.
I'll strip it for parts

04:16.000 --> 04:18.330
and then put it
in the recycling pile.

04:18.330 --> 04:20.330
Hey, fresh pile. Yay!

04:20.330 --> 04:21.380
No, hold up, hold up.

04:21.380 --> 04:22.290
This little treasure

04:22.290 --> 04:24.080
is for the keep pile.

04:24.080 --> 04:26.120
There's a reason I held on
to this all these years.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.670
[Suzy]
Tom, remember how
number four's due date

04:32.670 --> 04:34.120
was supposed to be next week?

04:34.120 --> 04:36.790
Surprise! The cashier
from Mega Mart

04:36.790 --> 04:38.830
is driving me to the hospital,
so get down here.

04:38.830 --> 04:40.670
Maybe ask our new
neighbor, Bethany,

04:40.670 --> 04:41.620
if she'll watch the kids.

04:41.620 --> 04:43.580
She seems nice.

04:43.580 --> 04:45.830
And two days later,
we came home
with number four.

04:45.830 --> 04:47.330
That's so cool.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.750
And thanks for going
with "Harley"

04:48.750 --> 04:49.880
instead of "Number Four,"
by the way.

04:49.880 --> 04:52.420
And thanks for not
calling me "Number Two."

04:52.420 --> 04:54.080
[all chuckle]

04:54.080 --> 04:56.380
[Georgie] Oh, wait.
The light's blinking.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.620
Looks like there's
another message on there.

04:58.620 --> 05:02.790
[Chaz] Tom Diaz, this is
Chaz the Mic Man from 102.2.

05:02.790 --> 05:05.790
You, my friend, are the lucky
winner of the Crimson Coupe

05:05.790 --> 05:08.380
from the hit TV show,
Crimson Justice.

05:08.380 --> 05:10.790
Call us back by 6:00 tonight,
and this baby's all yours.

05:10.790 --> 05:12.580
[soundboard]
1-0, 1-0, 102.--

05:12.580 --> 05:14.620
I can't believe it.
With all the excitement

05:14.620 --> 05:16.670
of Harley's birth,
I never heard that.

05:16.670 --> 05:18.290
I didn't even know
I won that contest.

05:18.290 --> 05:20.670
What is a Crimson Justice?

05:20.670 --> 05:23.330
Only the greatest show
in the history of television.

05:25.210 --> 05:27.250
It was about Mike Justice,

05:27.250 --> 05:29.040
a play-by-his-own-rules
detective who fought crime

05:29.040 --> 05:32.670
with his partner--
a talking car.

05:32.670 --> 05:36.670
People even said
that I look like the lead.

05:40.380 --> 05:41.620
[Georgie]
I don't see it.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.210
Well, now I know
how I'm spending

05:44.210 --> 05:45.580
my relaxing day.

05:45.580 --> 05:48.040
Ahh, imagine that.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.250
Me behind the wheel
of the Crimson Coupe.

05:50.250 --> 05:53.500
[sighs] Would've been
a dream come true. Eh.

05:57.500 --> 06:00.420
Wow, nice job being born
on the wrong day, Harley.

06:00.420 --> 06:02.290
Way to wreck Dad's dreams.

06:02.290 --> 06:03.710
I didn't--

06:03.710 --> 06:05.330
A person can't choose--

06:05.330 --> 06:07.540
Well, Mom wasn't
doing me any favors.

06:07.540 --> 06:10.380
What was she doing
walking around Mega Mart
that pregnant?

06:14.750 --> 06:16.290
I'm trying to storm out.
Just give me a minute.

06:25.330 --> 06:27.330
I checked the coolers,
checked the breakers,

06:27.330 --> 06:29.290
and bumped all
bait deliveries
to tomorrow.

06:29.290 --> 06:31.290
Dad's day of
absolutely nothing

06:31.290 --> 06:33.540
is a go, unless we want
to give the place

06:33.540 --> 06:35.080
-a quick courtesy mop.
-It's his birthday.

06:35.080 --> 06:36.710
He wasn't elected president.

06:36.710 --> 06:39.380
[sighs] Now to figure out
dinner, thanks to Harley.

06:39.380 --> 06:40.880
Why does she always
have to overachieve?

06:40.880 --> 06:42.920
I could not agree more.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.830
This guy right here,
C-minus in Biology.

06:45.830 --> 06:47.540
You're welcome.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.790
How about we raid
the lobster tanks
in the back?

06:49.790 --> 06:52.380
-We could boil him
up a feast.
-Dad'll love that.

06:52.380 --> 06:53.710
We'll cook his favorite
side dishes,

06:53.710 --> 06:55.170
unpack the fancy
table settings,

06:55.170 --> 06:57.460
even get some of those
cute, little lobster bibs.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.710
I was just thinking about
heating up the water,

06:59.710 --> 07:01.500
but sure, yeah,
we can do all that, too.

07:03.710 --> 07:05.330
[Georgie] Sweet!

07:05.330 --> 07:07.210
The Robo-Roper's
gonna help us clean.

07:07.210 --> 07:09.580
Better. The Robo-Roper's
going to make it

07:09.580 --> 07:10.920
look like we're cleaning
while we find

07:10.920 --> 07:14.210
Dad's ultimate gift--
the Crimson Coupe.

07:14.210 --> 07:16.290
Hmm, I'm sensing
a scheme unfolding.

07:16.290 --> 07:17.790
Please let it be
a good one.

07:17.790 --> 07:21.000
Sure, cleaning the garage
is a suitable gift,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.420
but tracking down
the Crimson Coupe
so Dad could drive it

07:23.420 --> 07:24.830
would give him
the best birthday ever.

07:24.830 --> 07:29.210
[Robo-Roper whirring]

07:29.210 --> 07:30.960
[Harley]
We'll just close
the garage door,

07:30.960 --> 07:33.750
and it'll sound like
we're cleaning up a storm.

07:36.960 --> 07:38.420
Question, dream-wrecker.

07:38.420 --> 07:40.210
What if Dad did
something unexpected

07:40.210 --> 07:42.500
like get off the couch
and open the garage door?

07:42.500 --> 07:44.290
That's where you come in.

07:44.290 --> 07:46.380
Never let Dad
out of your sight.

07:46.380 --> 07:47.920
Make him your new Deathne.

07:47.920 --> 07:50.000
Just don't cut his hair
and draw on his face.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.500
[sighs] But how are
we going to find a car

07:52.500 --> 07:54.750
Dad almost won
15 years ago?

07:54.750 --> 07:56.750
[Harley] Following
the only lead we have.

07:59.540 --> 08:01.960
[Chaz] Tom Diaz, this is
Chaz the Mic Man.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.250
Your dad is gonna be

08:04.250 --> 08:06.500
so excited about
his lobster feast.

08:06.500 --> 08:09.580
You can't wear a bib and dip
a BunBurger in melted butter.

08:09.580 --> 08:11.880
I mean, you can,
but I've asked him not to.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.500
I can't wait
to tell Chloe
how I grabbed

08:13.500 --> 08:15.170
live lobsters
with my bare hands.

08:15.170 --> 08:16.790
If she asks, don't mention

08:16.790 --> 08:18.040
they had rubber bands
around their claws.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.000
Do you have this
in a medium?

08:23.830 --> 08:26.290
Sorry, we're closed.

08:26.290 --> 08:28.420
Please? I just
need a few things.

08:28.420 --> 08:29.830
I promised my dad
I'd take him fishing

08:29.830 --> 08:31.290
-for his birthday today.
-[Suzy sighs]

08:31.290 --> 08:33.790
Mom, how can we
refuse a man

08:33.790 --> 08:36.210
that's simply trying to
reconnect with his father

08:36.210 --> 08:39.290
after a falling out over
a bad real estate deal?

08:39.290 --> 08:40.830
What? He didn't say that.

08:40.830 --> 08:45.000
No. I'm taking a character
workshop in screenwriting.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.790
I'm reading his subtext

08:46.790 --> 08:48.250
and filling in
the backstory.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.580
Am I right?

08:49.580 --> 08:51.880
If it lets me stay,
you bet.

08:51.880 --> 08:55.290
-[both chuckle]
-Fine. Hurry up.

08:55.290 --> 08:57.420
Hey, nothing bigger
than you can carry.

08:57.420 --> 08:59.250
I'm not strapping
a canoe to the roof

08:59.250 --> 09:01.290
when I still have to
cook dinner for eight.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.580
I'm Mike Justice.

09:02.580 --> 09:04.040
And justice is best served...

09:04.040 --> 09:06.670
Crimson.

09:06.670 --> 09:08.170
Is this a great show,
or what?

09:08.170 --> 09:10.040
Yes, it's so good.

09:10.040 --> 09:12.040
It probably can't get
any better.

09:12.040 --> 09:13.540
We should watch
something else

09:13.540 --> 09:15.420
just to see how
not-as-good

09:15.420 --> 09:17.500
-other things are.
-This is the classic

09:17.500 --> 09:18.710
where Mike Justice takes on

09:18.710 --> 09:19.830
a ring of corrupt
art dealers.

09:19.830 --> 09:21.040
We better hit it, Coupe.

09:21.040 --> 09:22.330
We gotta make it to the airport

09:22.330 --> 09:23.500
before that Van Gogh

09:23.500 --> 09:24.960
is "Van Gone."

09:24.960 --> 09:27.790
[Coupe]
Crime is wack, bro.

09:27.790 --> 09:29.670
I really hate Harley.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.790
What?

09:30.790 --> 09:32.330
I said I really hate

09:32.330 --> 09:34.960
that Harley can't
enjoy this, too.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.500
[Tom]
Mike really nailed
those art thieves.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.290
Nothing gets by him.
He's got eyes on the
back of his head.

09:39.290 --> 09:40.790
Stop them from
taking that Monet

09:40.790 --> 09:43.580
and selling it for money.

09:43.580 --> 09:46.250
You two are very similar
in that way.

09:46.250 --> 09:47.880
[Mike Justice]
Coupe, look out!

09:47.880 --> 09:49.540
[Georgie]
Well, there goes that lead.

09:49.540 --> 09:50.880
I can't believe they
don't have the records

09:50.880 --> 09:53.000
-of all the winners
from back then.
-I know!

09:53.000 --> 09:54.920
All the records they play
are from back then.

09:55.960 --> 09:58.620
Hey, this is Chaz the Mic Man

09:58.620 --> 10:01.080
spinning the classics while
you are stuck in traffic.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.290
Hit me up if you got a request.

10:03.290 --> 10:05.080
The Mic Man is
still on air?

10:05.080 --> 10:07.170
He gave away
a legendary TV car.

10:07.170 --> 10:09.040
He might remember
who he gave it to.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.040
Or if we're lucky,
maybe he kept it
for himself.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.670
Oh!

10:12.670 --> 10:14.120
[phone line trilling]

10:14.120 --> 10:15.750
You got the Mic Man!

10:15.750 --> 10:17.040
Do you remember
a talking car

10:17.040 --> 10:18.960
you gave away
15 years ago?

10:18.960 --> 10:20.750
Is that a song?
[chuckles]

10:20.750 --> 10:22.040
No, it's a question.

10:22.040 --> 10:23.460
Well, this is
the request line.

10:23.460 --> 10:24.960
[Harley]
Yes, and I'm requesting

10:24.960 --> 10:26.040
information on the c--

10:26.040 --> 10:29.500
[soundboard]
1-0, 1-0, 102.2!

10:29.500 --> 10:32.710
102.2.
What can I play for ya?

10:32.710 --> 10:34.920
Anything Ed Sheeran.
Okay, so about that--

10:34.920 --> 10:37.080
-[line clicks off]
-1-0, 1-0, 102.2!

10:37.080 --> 10:39.120
You'd think a guy
who gets zero callers

10:39.120 --> 10:40.460
would appreciate anyone
trying to hit him up.

10:40.460 --> 10:42.080
-You try.
-Well--

10:42.080 --> 10:43.290
[Chaz]
Call in with your favorites!

10:43.290 --> 10:46.210
I'm not very good at
speaking to authority.

10:46.210 --> 10:49.040
-[line trills]
-You got the Mic Man!

10:49.040 --> 10:50.920
[in British accent]
Pardon me! Might I trouble you

10:50.920 --> 10:52.250
for some info
about an autowheelie?

10:52.250 --> 10:53.960
Autowheelie?

10:53.960 --> 10:55.670
Why are you talking
in an accent?

10:55.670 --> 10:57.540
Well, I want him
to take me seriously.

10:57.540 --> 10:59.250
This is my professional
person voice.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.120
Uh, I need a song.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.960
Uh... Fish and Chips
by Strawberry Bruce.

11:03.960 --> 11:07.830
Okay, we got a lot
of weirdos out there.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.750
And in here.

11:12.750 --> 11:14.040
Enjoy this super hit.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.080
The Mic Man
will be right back.

11:16.080 --> 11:17.960
He's coming!

11:18.960 --> 11:20.620
What are you doing?

11:20.620 --> 11:22.000
Can you tell us
anything about

11:22.000 --> 11:23.710
who won the Crimson Coupe
15 years ago?

11:23.710 --> 11:25.750
Oh, the Crimson Coupe.

11:25.750 --> 11:27.920
Uh, let me see.
I think it was

11:27.920 --> 11:29.420
a guy by the name of--

11:29.420 --> 11:31.290
Are you kidding me?!

11:31.290 --> 11:33.790
How would I
remember that?

11:33.790 --> 11:35.040
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

11:35.040 --> 11:36.380
I only have
three and a half minutes

11:36.380 --> 11:38.080
to eat my meatball grinder.

11:38.080 --> 11:40.120
Should've put on
a longer song!

11:40.120 --> 11:41.920
Which gives us
three and a half minutes

11:41.920 --> 11:43.000
to ask where the
Crimson Coupe is.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.120
Ask who?

11:44.120 --> 11:45.920
Everybody.

11:50.710 --> 11:51.920
"Blimey, guvnor!"

11:51.920 --> 11:52.830
You shouldn't
be doing this!

11:52.830 --> 11:54.210
You'll get us nicked!

11:54.210 --> 11:56.120
We're trying to find
the Crimson Coupe.

11:56.120 --> 11:57.580
And do you need
to keep doing that?

11:57.580 --> 11:59.920
Yes, I do. I'm practicing
for when I tell the police

11:59.920 --> 12:01.380
I have no idea
who you are.

12:01.380 --> 12:03.080
Don't worry.
This is nothing.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.790
I do the morning
announcements.

12:05.790 --> 12:08.540
Hey, hey! This is
Harley Diaz comin' at ya!

12:08.540 --> 12:10.080
I'm asking all my listeners

12:10.080 --> 12:12.040
if anyone knows
the current location

12:12.040 --> 12:15.210
of TV's legendary car,
the Crimson Coupe.

12:15.210 --> 12:17.250
[klaxon horn blows]

12:17.250 --> 12:19.170
There's no time
for "ahooogas"!
He's coming!

12:19.170 --> 12:20.620
Uh, this speedster
on wheels

12:20.620 --> 12:21.880
is from the show
Crimson Justice,

12:21.880 --> 12:23.250
and was given away
by this very

12:23.250 --> 12:24.710
radio station
15 years ago.

12:24.710 --> 12:27.080
Uh, call now with info,
and I'll give you

12:27.080 --> 12:28.420
a 10% off coupon to
Tom's Bait and Bite.

12:28.420 --> 12:30.790
In the meantime,
groove on this!

12:37.790 --> 12:39.750
[in accent]
Apologies for the oopsie daisy!

12:39.750 --> 12:41.080
Mind the gap!

12:46.880 --> 12:48.040
You let more people in?

12:48.040 --> 12:50.170
Their dingy sprung a leak.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.790
And that's not backstory.
They actually said that.

12:52.790 --> 12:54.250
Well, now we're not
gonna have time

12:54.250 --> 12:55.790
to stop and buy
the lobster bibs.

12:55.790 --> 12:58.420
We both know a bib's
not enough for Dad.

12:58.420 --> 13:00.830
We'll grab him a tarp
in the boat section.

13:00.830 --> 13:02.250
You can't be such a softy.

13:02.250 --> 13:03.380
Move these people along.

13:03.380 --> 13:04.580
Pretend they're
your brothers

13:04.580 --> 13:05.750
and shoo 'em away
with a paddle.

13:05.750 --> 13:07.170
Oh, yes. I can see

13:07.170 --> 13:08.330
the online review now.

13:08.330 --> 13:11.080
"Great prices,
cozy atmosphere.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.460
Oldest boy will
shove you out with oar."

13:12.460 --> 13:14.500
[sighs] Guess I have to
take care of it.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.880
I'm sorry,
but we're closed!

13:18.880 --> 13:21.420
Yep, take this and this.
Thank you.

13:21.420 --> 13:24.290
Yep, we're closed.

13:24.290 --> 13:27.080
Okay, thanks.
Hi! [chuckles]

13:27.080 --> 13:29.040
We're closed!

13:29.040 --> 13:32.960
Closed.

13:32.960 --> 13:34.540
See the sign?

13:38.290 --> 13:40.120
Do you know how much trouble

13:40.120 --> 13:42.250
I could be in
with my station manager?

13:42.250 --> 13:44.330
Lucky for me,
he got fired years ago,

13:44.330 --> 13:46.290
and was replaced
by a computer in Rhode Island.

13:46.290 --> 13:47.880
Robot boss,
talking car.

13:47.880 --> 13:49.290
Look how much
we have in common.

13:49.290 --> 13:51.290
-[sighs]
-Please don't
throw us out.

13:51.290 --> 13:54.460
Us? I have no blooming idea
who this one is.

13:54.460 --> 13:57.080
[phone line trilling]

13:57.080 --> 13:59.250
[chuckling] Okay!

13:59.250 --> 14:01.750
It's 102.2 where
lunches are short

14:01.750 --> 14:04.330
and my patience is shorter.

14:04.330 --> 14:06.170
Let's see who's
on the request line.

14:06.170 --> 14:07.620
You got the Mic Man!

14:07.620 --> 14:10.210
I'm calling
about the Crimson Coupe.

14:10.210 --> 14:12.330
[sighs]

14:12.330 --> 14:13.920
If you let us
talk to that woman,

14:13.920 --> 14:15.250
we'll leave
and never come back.

14:15.250 --> 14:17.120
Now, that's
the best request

14:17.120 --> 14:18.920
-I've had all day.
-[Harley] Yes!

14:18.920 --> 14:20.170
What do you got?

14:20.170 --> 14:21.540
Can't fight that biker gang

14:21.540 --> 14:23.330
without a healthy dose
of vitamin A...

14:23.330 --> 14:24.960
and ranch.

14:24.960 --> 14:27.920
[Coupe]
Nutrition's important, bro.

14:27.920 --> 14:31.290
They always tried to subtly
work in an important message.

14:31.290 --> 14:34.040
Yes, I'm subtly
learning so much.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.790
First thing--
they say "bro" a lot.

14:36.790 --> 14:39.330
Yeah, yeah.
When I was a kid,

14:39.330 --> 14:41.000
me and your Uncle Chick
made a game out of it.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.040
Every time
someone said "bro"

14:42.040 --> 14:43.040
we took a slug of milk.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.000
Ooh. We should do that.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.170
Drink chocolate milk

14:46.170 --> 14:47.210
every time
someone said "bro."

14:47.210 --> 14:48.920
I just said "milk."

14:48.920 --> 14:52.670
I know, but we need to
make this our game, Daddy.

14:54.290 --> 14:56.250
[Coupe] Time to take out
the trash, bro.

14:56.250 --> 14:57.380
[Daphne]
Ooh! Drink.

14:59.250 --> 15:01.290
Bye-bye, bikers.
[chuckles]

15:03.420 --> 15:04.670
Ooh!

15:04.670 --> 15:06.290
Every time there's
an explosion,

15:06.290 --> 15:07.620
we should eat
a brownie.

15:07.620 --> 15:09.290
They blow up a lot of stuff
on this show.

15:09.290 --> 15:11.080
-Yeah.
-I'll go preheat
the oven.

15:13.460 --> 15:16.000
Yes, my son
won the car

15:16.000 --> 15:18.460
but he stopped
driving it years ago.

15:18.460 --> 15:21.250
He moved away
and kind of
lost interest.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.250
Having the chance to drive
the Crimson Coupe

15:23.250 --> 15:24.670
will change our dad's life.

15:24.670 --> 15:27.170
Drive it? I thought
you were here to buy it.

15:27.170 --> 15:28.960
It's for sale?

15:28.960 --> 15:30.330
Shouldn't you check
with your son?

15:30.330 --> 15:32.290
Well, maybe he should've
checked in with me

15:32.290 --> 15:34.080
after I broke my hip
last winter.

15:34.080 --> 15:37.000
Oh, it's just
taking up space here.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.120
How's 300 bucks sound?

15:40.250 --> 15:42.120
I have that much
in my slush fund.

15:42.120 --> 15:44.120
It's literally
from selling slushies.

15:44.120 --> 15:47.210
The Boi-Zendaya-Berry
has been a huge hit
this season.

15:47.210 --> 15:48.460
We'll be right back.

15:51.620 --> 15:54.080
[children chattering]

16:00.670 --> 16:02.620
There's even more people
than before.

16:02.620 --> 16:05.080
Dad's homemade potatoes
just became instant.

16:05.080 --> 16:07.920
Apparently,
Rod's Reel and Deal
had a power outage.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.620
We're the only
fishing game in town.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.500
And the instant potatoes
just became chips.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.040
[sighs]

16:13.040 --> 16:14.620
It's time to get tough
and bounce people.

16:14.620 --> 16:15.620
Yeah.

16:15.620 --> 16:17.880
Let's go, buddy.

16:17.880 --> 16:19.880
Buy it
and "bye-bye it."

16:19.880 --> 16:22.920
And you, there's
no fish biting in here.

16:22.920 --> 16:24.420
Take it outside.

16:24.420 --> 16:25.330
I mean, after
you pay for it.

16:25.330 --> 16:28.500
[clanging]

16:28.500 --> 16:29.830
Attention!

16:29.830 --> 16:31.170
If you're not out of the store

16:31.170 --> 16:32.920
in the next five minutes,

16:32.920 --> 16:34.080
I'm releasing the frogs.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.620
[shoppers chattering]

16:35.620 --> 16:37.670
[Suzy] Don't test me,
people! I'll do it.

16:37.670 --> 16:39.040
[clanging]

16:39.040 --> 16:41.380
[Suzy]
Let's go, we're closed.

16:41.380 --> 16:43.460
Bye, girls.
Good job.

16:43.460 --> 16:46.330
Sorry! That bank
was a lot further

16:46.330 --> 16:47.880
than I'd remembered.

16:47.880 --> 16:50.460
-Three hundred dollars.
-[Georgie sighs] And...

16:50.460 --> 16:53.040
a brochure on senior savings
plans where you could put it.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.170
The woman on the front is
on a cruise with her dog.

16:55.170 --> 16:59.670
Oh, that's very thoughtful.

16:59.670 --> 17:02.500
The car is yours, girls.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.420
Great! Where is it?

17:14.380 --> 17:17.960
I think we just spent $300
to clean another garage.

17:23.790 --> 17:25.580
Any chance you could
really quickly invent

17:25.580 --> 17:27.210
a garage-cleaning machine?

17:27.210 --> 17:29.420
Sure, I'll just
work on some sketches

17:29.420 --> 17:30.540
while you move the boxes.

Does this thing
actually talk?

18:02.790 --> 18:04.920
If so, it better
say thank you.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.670
Hmm, all those mouthfuls

18:06.670 --> 18:08.750
of dust bunnies and cobwebs
are gonna be worth it.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.540
We're gonna make
Dad's dream come true.

[brakes screech]

18:14.670 --> 18:17.460
[mournful musical flourish]

18:17.460 --> 18:18.830
Do you think
Dad has a dream

18:18.830 --> 18:20.580
to tow
the Crimson Coupe?

18:20.580 --> 18:23.000
-[car sizzles]
-[Harley coughs]

18:25.670 --> 18:27.880
Be sure to tell your friends
we're closed.

18:27.880 --> 18:29.790
[sighs]

18:31.620 --> 18:33.710
[sighs]
All right, instead of

18:33.710 --> 18:36.540
a festive bib, yummy sides,
and fancy china,

18:36.540 --> 18:38.710
we've got a tarp, chips,
and chipped plates.

18:38.710 --> 18:40.830
But the headliner's lobster.

18:40.830 --> 18:43.250
No one cares about
the opening acts anyway.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.500
[Ethan]
They're gone!

18:46.500 --> 18:47.580
Someone must've
stolen them.

18:47.580 --> 18:48.540
Well, they sure didn't

18:48.540 --> 18:49.750
walk out of here
on their own.

18:49.750 --> 18:50.830
Right. I mean, yeah,

18:50.830 --> 18:52.080
the coolers
are flipped over

18:52.080 --> 18:53.750
and there's trails
of water leading

18:53.750 --> 18:56.500
-all over the store, but...
-[gasps] They escaped!

18:56.500 --> 18:58.380
There's animals
with giant pinchers

18:58.380 --> 18:59.460
loose all over the store!

18:59.460 --> 19:01.580
Mom, Mom, relax.
They can't hurt us.

19:01.580 --> 19:03.170
They have rubber bands
around their claws.

19:03.170 --> 19:04.250
Like those?

19:07.620 --> 19:09.170
-Run! Aah!
-[Suzy screaming]

19:09.170 --> 19:12.170
[both screaming]

19:14.620 --> 19:16.500
What a disaster.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.580
Instead of taking on
Dad's nightmare,

19:18.580 --> 19:19.960
we created a new one.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.620
We didn't
clean the garage,

19:21.620 --> 19:22.960
and now we're gonna
ruin his day off

19:22.960 --> 19:24.460
by making him
come get us.

19:24.460 --> 19:27.330
Hmm. He spent all day
with Daphne.

19:27.330 --> 19:29.290
Maybe he'll welcome
the break.

19:29.290 --> 19:30.620
[tires squealing, explosion]

19:30.620 --> 19:32.040
Ooh! Explosion!

19:32.040 --> 19:33.670
Brownie me.

19:33.670 --> 19:34.920
[Mike Justice]
I'm beginning to think

19:34.920 --> 19:36.670
this ghost town isn't empty.

19:36.670 --> 19:38.670
[Coupe]
Spooky.

19:38.670 --> 19:40.540
Mm, cheesy guitar riff.

19:40.540 --> 19:41.540
What do we eat now?
Jelly beans?

19:41.540 --> 19:43.620
No, churro.
Jelly beans are for

19:43.620 --> 19:45.380
when Mike takes off
his sunglasses.

19:45.380 --> 19:48.540
[Mike Justice]
...and let's do this.

19:48.540 --> 19:51.250
-Oh, there they go.
-These shady cattle ranchers

19:51.250 --> 19:53.080
have roped their last
prized steer, Coupe.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.500
[Coupe]
Giddy up, bro.

19:56.040 --> 19:57.080
[Mike Justice]
Hold on, Coupe.

19:57.080 --> 19:58.620
Let me stretch first.

19:58.620 --> 20:00.250
Ahh, stretching's important.

20:00.250 --> 20:02.580
Oh, teaching a lesson.
Gotta have the broccoli.

20:02.580 --> 20:04.580
Ugh, you had to throw in
one healthy food.

20:04.580 --> 20:06.330
[phone ringing]

20:06.330 --> 20:08.040
[Coupe]
Junk in my trunk.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.500
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

20:10.500 --> 20:11.750
Harley?

20:11.750 --> 20:12.750
Don't tell her
what we're doing.

20:12.750 --> 20:13.750
She'll want in.

20:13.750 --> 20:15.040
This is our game, bro.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.540
Ooh! Drink!

20:17.670 --> 20:20.250
Mm? What?

20:21.710 --> 20:22.920
First things first.
Are you girls okay?

20:22.920 --> 20:23.920
-Yeah.
-Yes.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.080
Good.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.420
It's the Crimson Coupe,

20:26.420 --> 20:27.540
the Crimson Coupe!

20:27.540 --> 20:29.710
How did you get
the Crimson Coupe?

20:29.710 --> 20:32.960
It was supposed to be
your birthday present.

20:32.960 --> 20:34.170
I'm sorry.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.670
For what?

20:36.670 --> 20:38.540
For making you
miss that message.

20:38.540 --> 20:40.670
The Diazes are
notoriously late.

20:40.670 --> 20:43.080
Who did I think I was
being six days early?

20:43.080 --> 20:44.670
You were just being born.

20:44.670 --> 20:46.380
You didn't know
family traditions.

20:46.380 --> 20:49.540
Yeah, but because of me
you had to sacrifice the car.

20:49.540 --> 20:52.580
And now you had to
sacrifice your day off
to come and get us.

20:52.580 --> 20:54.040
You know what
that's called?

20:54.040 --> 20:55.500
Being a parent.

20:55.500 --> 20:57.080
I knew that when I
signed up for it,

20:57.080 --> 20:58.710
and I love it.

20:58.710 --> 20:59.670
[sighs]

20:59.670 --> 21:02.080
Nothing I do
for you guys

21:02.080 --> 21:04.960
as a dad is ever
a sacrifice.

21:04.960 --> 21:07.920
In fact, I got
a great idea.

21:13.210 --> 21:14.790
By the time we're done
restoring this,

21:14.790 --> 21:16.210
it'll be just like
it was on the show.

21:16.210 --> 21:17.750
Yeah, so it's not
gonna talk.

21:17.750 --> 21:18.710
That was TV magic.

21:18.710 --> 21:21.420
It could with
a little Harley magic.

21:21.420 --> 21:23.790
You see? This car
is gonna be way better

21:23.790 --> 21:25.670
than if I'd won it
15 years ago.

21:25.670 --> 21:28.580
Make sure Coupey
knows how to say,
"Crime is wack!"

21:28.580 --> 21:31.080
I thought it was dumb,
but it's kinda grown on me.

21:31.080 --> 21:33.080
-[all chuckle]
-[Daphne] Here.

21:33.080 --> 21:34.710
[laughs]

21:34.710 --> 21:36.000
I love being a dad.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.580
[Suzy]
Was that in the garage?

21:38.580 --> 21:41.500
Man, we really did need
to clean that thing out.

21:41.500 --> 21:42.580
The girls got it for me.

21:45.380 --> 21:47.120
Uh, oh. Sorry.

21:47.120 --> 21:49.210
All we got you
was BunBurger...

21:49.210 --> 21:50.750
like we do every year.

21:50.750 --> 21:52.710
Yeah, and every year
it's my favortie.

21:52.710 --> 21:55.170
Favorite burger,
favorite car,

21:55.170 --> 21:56.250
favorite family.

21:57.670 --> 21:59.620
I have never felt
so re-appreciated.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.290
Bring it in!

22:03.290 --> 22:04.750
So, are we gonna tell him

22:04.750 --> 22:06.250
we didn't clean out
the garage?

22:06.250 --> 22:07.670
If I get this thing
talking fast enough,

22:07.670 --> 22:08.790
we'll have the car
break it to him.

22:08.790 --> 22:09.620
Mm.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.670
[all chattering]

22:11.670 --> 22:12.750
[Suzy]
Should we eat?

22:12.750 --> 22:14.290
Let's do it!

22:14.290 --> 22:16.290
Best birthday ever!

22:16.290 --> 22:17.580
Birthday dinner.

22:17.580 --> 22:19.580
[all chattering]
