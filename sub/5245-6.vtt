WEBVTT

00:42.419 --> 00:43.503
Stop!

00:48.258 --> 00:49.467
OK!

00:55.432 --> 00:58.852
- How are you?
- Very well. How are you?

00:59.060 --> 01:01.020
Your ID, please.

01:01.980 --> 01:03.440
Certainly.

01:26.671 --> 01:27.881
Give me that.

01:29.424 --> 01:32.427
How many times have I told you
not to throw the ball over there?

01:32.510 --> 01:34.512
Are you trying
to scare your sister or what?

01:34.596 --> 01:36.181
- She's crying.
- Of course she's crying.

01:36.264 --> 01:37.849
Don't you see she's just a baby?

01:37.932 --> 01:39.809
You yourself were a baby
not too long ago.

01:39.893 --> 01:41.227
Yes, Dad.

01:41.311 --> 01:43.021
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:44.481 --> 01:46.316
What's wrong, Juan Pablo?

01:46.399 --> 01:48.109
I want her to die.

01:50.987 --> 01:52.614
Never say that.

01:54.240 --> 01:59.746
We are a family and we have
to look out for each other, always.

01:59.829 --> 02:01.414
You hear me?

02:15.094 --> 02:18.348
<i>- Hello.
- Cousin, Poison just took out some cops.</i>

02:18.431 --> 02:21.392
- Yes, go on. How many?
- Two.

02:21.476 --> 02:23.978
Yeah, but two what?
Sergeants or officers?

02:24.062 --> 02:26.022
<i>Officers. You know Poison.</i>

02:26.105 --> 02:29.901
- Officers are a million each.
- OK, so two <i>million?</i>

02:29.984 --> 02:33.071
- Yes, I'm writing it down here.
- OK, <i>talk</i> to you later.

02:33.154 --> 02:34.531
All right.

02:35.490 --> 02:37.283
What were you talking about?

02:37.367 --> 02:39.285
Just business.

02:39.369 --> 02:41.996
I want to be a businessman like you.

09:35.409 --> 09:38.037
Good morning, ladies.
Where are you headed?

09:43.376 --> 09:45.086
You speak Spanish?

09:45.169 --> 09:46.379
Yes.

09:47.630 --> 09:49.966
I asked where you are headed.

09:50.049 --> 09:52.343
- Popayán.
- Popayán?

09:52.426 --> 09:54.011
Your papers, please.

10:40.766 --> 10:42.310
Ms. Connie Murphy.

10:43.936 --> 10:45.104
Alba Borraga.

10:46.605 --> 10:47.857
Have a nice trip.

10:49.025 --> 10:50.484
- Thank you.
- Be well.

14:14.647 --> 14:17.316
WITH GAVIRIA
THERE WILL BE A FUTURE

14:36.043 --> 14:39.380
Have you heard of this thing
called a computer?

14:40.256 --> 14:43.842
Some guy was trying to sell me one.
I don't know what it is.

14:43.926 --> 14:49.306
It's a new kind of technology
that's coming out.

14:50.266 --> 14:52.560
- It's coming out now?
- Yeah, Dad.

14:54.812 --> 14:56.897
Hey, honey.

14:59.024 --> 15:02.069
You look very beautiful today.

15:04.488 --> 15:08.158
Relax, baby. Relax.
We don't bite.

15:10.452 --> 15:13.789
- Do you need anything else?
- I want you.

15:14.748 --> 15:17.501
- Nothing more, thank you.
- Yes, sir.

15:20.379 --> 15:22.339
I want to fuck her.

15:22.548 --> 15:26.468
We have more important things
to worry about right now, my son.

15:26.677 --> 15:28.220
Understood?

15:29.388 --> 15:31.932
Talk to me. What do you know?

15:32.016 --> 15:34.810
Mr. Gonzalo,
we have people all over the property.

15:34.893 --> 15:36.228
It's secure.

15:36.312 --> 15:38.647
We've got a few men in town as well.

15:40.107 --> 15:44.278
Now, what can you tell me about Medellin?

15:45.738 --> 15:47.615
The same, boss.

15:47.698 --> 15:51.785
Carrillo's entire Search Bloc
is out looking for Pablo.

15:51.869 --> 15:53.245
Thank you, Navegante.

15:53.454 --> 15:56.373
- Here to serve, boss.
- Keep us safe.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.169
Don Freddy.

16:03.297 --> 16:06.175
Son... a question.

16:07.509 --> 16:10.512
Are we sheep or are we wolves?

16:10.721 --> 16:14.975
- We're wolves.
- We're wolves! Right.

16:15.059 --> 16:16.560
I like it.

16:18.979 --> 16:22.941
They're in a house outside of Cartagena.
Right here.

16:23.025 --> 16:26.820
Just know there are a lot of people
guarding him.

16:27.029 --> 16:32.034
Navegante, you've been
working for Gacha for many years.

16:32.117 --> 16:36.038
I'm sure in that time you've
earned way more than we are giving you.

16:36.955 --> 16:39.500
So tell me,
why do you want to betray him?

16:43.128 --> 16:45.130
That fucker's crazy.

16:46.674 --> 16:48.759
He's gonna get us all killed.

16:58.977 --> 17:01.313
I don't believe him one bit.

17:01.397 --> 17:04.108
What do you care why he's doing it?

17:04.191 --> 17:09.321
Because we have 23 agents with
outdated weapons waiting in Barranquilla.

17:09.405 --> 17:13.575
And he has twice as many men
with brand new weapons.

17:13.659 --> 17:15.369
And frankly...

17:15.452 --> 17:19.873
I'm tired of sending young men
to face certain death.

17:19.957 --> 17:22.084
So then we have to be smart.

17:24.253 --> 17:26.255
We have to create a trap.

17:26.338 --> 17:28.924
If we catch him alive,
he'll give us Escobar.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.509
And the Ochoas.

17:30.592 --> 17:34.346
- The entire cartel.
- I don't give a fuck, Javier.

17:34.430 --> 17:35.764
I want him dead.

17:35.848 --> 17:37.975
He doesn't care about death.

17:38.058 --> 17:41.145
He only fears rotting in jail.

17:42.563 --> 17:46.442
- That's the real victory.
- Right, I forgot you're a gringo.

17:47.526 --> 17:51.363
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What are you risking?

17:51.447 --> 17:53.240
These aren't your men.

17:53.323 --> 17:55.659
You have no family hereto lose.

17:55.784 --> 17:58.287
If this goes badly, there will be
more widows and orphans,

17:58.454 --> 18:01.498
and I will have to carry that
on my shoulders.

18:04.710 --> 18:06.587
Well...

18:06.670 --> 18:09.256
I trust his information.

18:12.342 --> 18:14.303
And I trust you.

18:15.137 --> 18:20.100
But if this turns out bad...
it'll be on your conscience.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.760
Here's your payment, sir.

18:57.137 --> 19:00.766
It'll be taken to the coast of Spain
on a cargo ship.

19:00.849 --> 19:04.186
From there, our trucks
will take it to the Basque country.

19:05.771 --> 19:07.314
It's all set up.

19:10.067 --> 19:13.403
5,000 kilos or I go back to Spain
on the first flight.

19:17.866 --> 19:19.326
What's that?

19:21.453 --> 19:23.580
As far as I know, you and my cousin
have an agreement.

19:23.789 --> 19:25.999
The agreement is for this amount.

19:26.083 --> 19:27.960
What kind of bullshit is this?

19:29.002 --> 19:31.338
5,000 kilos or no deal.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.341
Then there is no deal.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.718
Who the fuck
do you think you're talking to?

19:41.598 --> 19:43.851
Forgive my cousin, sir.

19:49.273 --> 19:51.859
5,000 it is, then.

20:00.450 --> 20:01.785
We shouldn't go.

20:03.078 --> 20:05.289
I want you in the US.

20:05.372 --> 20:08.292
You'll be safe there,
far from all of this.

20:08.375 --> 20:11.295
- What if something happens--
- Nothing is going to happen to me.

20:12.462 --> 20:13.922
Let's go.

20:26.435 --> 20:28.520
Please, protect him.

20:29.396 --> 20:32.566
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.
Come on, I'll walk you.

20:38.113 --> 20:40.198
Bye, Daddy, I love you!

21:39.633 --> 21:42.678
- Hello, Suárez.
- Look who's here.

21:42.761 --> 21:44.554
The Golden Gringo.

21:46.431 --> 21:49.184
I called your office.

21:50.185 --> 21:51.853
I only speak to Pefia.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.360
<i>Weed...</i>

21:58.568 --> 21:59.861
<i>Weed...</i>

22:01.446 --> 22:04.783
I need to know who he is.

22:06.576 --> 22:10.080
"I need to know who he is."

22:10.288 --> 22:12.332
Don't make me laugh, faggot.

22:13.250 --> 22:15.585
"I need to know who he is."

22:22.467 --> 22:26.930
You work for me, asshole!
Right? Is that clear?

22:27.139 --> 22:28.598
Is that clear?!

24:33.056 --> 24:37.144
- I feel like he's still too soft.
- He'll be fine.

24:39.813 --> 24:40.981
I don't know, Pablo.

24:41.064 --> 24:43.733
I feel like we need
to suspend the operation.

24:43.817 --> 24:47.362
- It's too delicate.
- You worry too much, Gustavo.

24:48.947 --> 24:51.700
That's the reason
your hair is falling out.

24:53.034 --> 24:55.036
Very funny, motherfucker.

24:57.706 --> 24:59.457
Keep laughing-

25:02.210 --> 25:04.087
How's our boy doing, Mom?

25:04.171 --> 25:07.382
He's learning,
with a little tough love.

25:07.465 --> 25:09.426
- What's up, Aunt?
- What's new?

25:10.427 --> 25:14.806
That's so he can mix
with the sons of the oligarchs, right?

25:14.890 --> 25:17.475
- Yes, sir.
- So he can get us some information.

25:18.768 --> 25:20.395
What about these clowns?

25:21.813 --> 25:23.440
Are they treating you right?

25:24.399 --> 25:26.193
More or less.

25:27.235 --> 25:30.614
What do you mean "more or less"?
We treat you good.

25:31.990 --> 25:33.617
Are we going to eat, Gustavo?

25:36.328 --> 25:37.746
- Some rice?
- Yes.

25:44.419 --> 25:45.795
Thank you.

25:47.214 --> 25:48.298
Jaime.

25:50.425 --> 25:52.594
Welcome to the family.

25:54.304 --> 25:56.264
Thank you, boss.

26:00.143 --> 26:01.895
Can't you do anything?

26:03.063 --> 26:04.189
No.

26:06.191 --> 26:08.401
While we're at war,
we can't do anything.

26:09.194 --> 26:11.863
This is bullshit.
People are turning up dead every day

26:11.947 --> 26:15.158
and my friends
think my brothers are responsible.

26:17.285 --> 26:19.704
Let's talk about something else, baby.

26:20.872 --> 26:21.831
Yeah.

26:22.874 --> 26:25.877
All right,
let's talk about running away together.

26:25.961 --> 26:28.004
Let's get away while we can.

26:30.465 --> 26:33.760
"Let's get away."
Listen to this.

26:39.849 --> 26:42.602
Why would you run away
with a criminal like me?

26:44.271 --> 26:45.814
And why not?

26:48.566 --> 26:50.568
I wish it was that easy.

26:50.652 --> 26:53.280
I can't just leave like that.

26:53.363 --> 26:55.282
I know.

26:55.365 --> 26:57.826
You say that because of your wife.

26:57.909 --> 27:00.370
I don't give a shit about my wife.

27:01.329 --> 27:05.458
I'm talking about your other wife, Pablo.

27:05.542 --> 27:07.794
Who is the woman in that relationship?

27:07.877 --> 27:09.296
YOU?

27:37.782 --> 27:39.659
Hey, doll.

27:39.743 --> 27:41.244
What are you doing?

27:43.038 --> 27:44.331
I'm married, sir.

27:44.414 --> 27:46.458
That's no problem.
I can make you a widow pretty quick.

27:46.541 --> 27:48.960
Don't touch me! Don't touch me.

27:49.044 --> 27:51.546
Freddy, leave her alone.
Come here.

27:51.629 --> 27:52.672
What's up?

27:52.881 --> 27:56.301
The Search Bloc is here,
not in Medellin.

27:56.384 --> 27:58.136
But Navegante said they were over there.

27:58.219 --> 28:02.015
Navegante... Navegante is a liar.

28:02.223 --> 28:03.641
He wouldn't betray you.

28:03.850 --> 28:08.229
Freddy... think, think.

28:08.313 --> 28:11.274
Everyone in the world has a price.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.111
All right, let's go!

28:15.195 --> 28:18.239
They want war, we'll give them war!

30:56.648 --> 31:00.401
His name is Steve Murphy.
He's DEA.

31:00.485 --> 31:02.820
I hope you'll pay for this information.

31:13.456 --> 31:16.626
Suárez is talking to the DEA.

31:19.003 --> 31:21.339
You know what you have to do.

31:54.706 --> 31:56.124
He got away.

31:57.709 --> 31:59.794
They killed the goddamn maid.

32:03.172 --> 32:04.340
Colonel!

32:07.969 --> 32:08.928
Colonel...

32:11.139 --> 32:12.807
They called from the road block.

32:12.890 --> 32:16.519
They have a car stopped
and they're saying the driver's a senator.

32:16.603 --> 32:19.105
- Does he have his identification?
- Everything checks out.

32:19.188 --> 32:20.690
So what's the problem?

32:21.566 --> 32:24.235
They found a machine gun in the trunk.

32:25.028 --> 32:26.404
Let's go.

32:37.373 --> 32:39.208
Look at my credentials.

32:39.292 --> 32:42.211
No, I don't know this Gacha person
you're referring to.

32:43.504 --> 32:46.007
Why do you have a gun in the trunk?

32:48.051 --> 32:53.931
Gentlemen, are you asking why a politician
in this country carries a weapon?

32:54.015 --> 32:55.725
Please.

32:55.808 --> 32:58.728
- It's my bodyguard's.
- Where's your bodyguard?

32:59.771 --> 33:01.939
You're alone in the car, right?

33:03.608 --> 33:05.610
Listen to me, officers...

33:05.693 --> 33:10.323
if you don't let me go immediately,
you're going to regret it.

33:14.786 --> 33:16.079
Thank you.

33:16.788 --> 33:19.415
- Give us a moment.
- Go on.

33:22.085 --> 33:24.295
I don't believe him.

33:24.379 --> 33:25.963
I don't either.

33:28.132 --> 33:30.510
He could have bought his credentials.

33:31.469 --> 33:34.097
What if it turns out he is a senator?

33:34.180 --> 33:35.932
We'll pay for that.

33:37.892 --> 33:40.478
I can't run that risk.

33:40.561 --> 33:42.397
It's true.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.190
You can't.

33:47.902 --> 33:51.656
The next one...
goes in your head!

33:51.739 --> 33:53.491
- All right, all right!
- Talk, bitch!

33:53.574 --> 33:55.660
I'll talk, I'll talk!

33:57.412 --> 34:01.165
I love you, my sweetheart.
I love you.

34:01.249 --> 34:04.252
You have a guest.
It's Don Pablo.

34:05.461 --> 34:07.797
Hey, Jaime.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.465
- Don Pablo.
- This is your house?

34:09.549 --> 34:12.552
- Your family?
- Yes, sir. Welcome.

34:12.635 --> 34:13.928
Tell me about them.

34:14.011 --> 34:16.639
This is my daughter Marcela.

34:16.723 --> 34:19.016
Look at what a cute baby.

34:19.100 --> 34:21.811
- How proud you must be.
- Of course I am.

34:21.894 --> 34:23.813
Of course.

34:23.896 --> 34:28.276
Very soon, they will have the money
to buy everything they want, Jaime.

34:28.359 --> 34:29.902
Thanks a lot, boss.

34:29.986 --> 34:31.904
- May I please have a glass of water?
- Of course.

34:31.988 --> 34:33.489
Thank you.

34:33.573 --> 34:34.741
- What about you?
- Good, sir.

34:34.824 --> 34:37.827
- How have you been?
- Good, thank you.

34:38.745 --> 34:39.829
Guys.

34:40.663 --> 34:43.166
All right, Jaime.

34:44.500 --> 34:47.587
This is for you to wear
during your mission.

34:47.670 --> 34:49.255
Thank you, Ma'am. Very kind.

34:49.338 --> 34:51.299
Seriously, Pablo?

34:51.382 --> 34:53.092
Thank you very much.

34:53.176 --> 34:55.261
Everything is so beautiful.

34:55.344 --> 35:00.057
You have to be very careful,
and get by unnoticed.

35:00.141 --> 35:03.352
For sure, sir.
I'm ready to do what you're asking.

35:03.561 --> 35:05.563
All right, then, son.

35:05.646 --> 35:07.106
Sit down.

35:09.150 --> 35:13.404
These guys are going to give you
very specific instructions.

35:13.488 --> 35:16.532
Tomorrow morning, you're boarding
the plane that is leaving for Cali.

35:16.741 --> 35:19.744
We want you to record a conversation.

35:19.827 --> 35:22.580
It's very simple. Nothing to worry about.

35:23.706 --> 35:25.541
All right.

35:28.252 --> 35:32.840
- How are you feeling?
- I'm... I'm very happy.

35:32.924 --> 35:36.761
Thank you very much for the opportunity,
Don Pablo. Seriously. And for the clothes.

35:36.844 --> 35:39.597
Really, for me,
it's an honor to work for you.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.349
Thank you very much.

35:42.558 --> 35:44.227
Don't mention it.

35:45.895 --> 35:47.355
OK.

35:47.438 --> 35:49.774
Come here, give me a hug.

35:51.567 --> 35:53.444
Thank you, Don Pablo.

35:54.821 --> 35:56.364
Thank you.

35:57.365 --> 35:59.534
- Ma'am, have a good night.
- Take care.

35:59.617 --> 36:01.244
Thank you very much.

36:01.327 --> 36:02.995
See you later, boys.

36:03.079 --> 36:05.289
- Take care.
- Yes, sir.

36:05.373 --> 36:07.834
My love, look!

36:07.917 --> 36:12.296
- Look at this jacket. Beautiful, right?
- It's beautiful. What did Pablo say?

36:12.380 --> 36:15.883
You know what?
We're going to get ahead.

36:17.260 --> 36:20.972
You, me and the baby
are going to get ahead.

36:21.055 --> 36:22.390
Thank you, my love.

36:22.473 --> 36:25.142
- Look at this.
- Let's go try it on.

36:28.604 --> 36:31.232
I have some news about Gaviria.

36:31.315 --> 36:34.068
They're going to kill him
on the way to Cali.

36:43.911 --> 36:46.247
Wait a moment.
Someone is at the door.

37:02.096 --> 37:04.098
Pablo doesn't like you talking to the DEA.

37:49.185 --> 37:50.895
It was her fault, Dad.

37:50.978 --> 37:54.398
Are you still thinking about that?
Let it go, son.

37:54.482 --> 37:58.444
All she had to do was say yes
and I wouldn't have had to shoot her!

37:58.527 --> 37:59.820
Be a man!

38:28.975 --> 38:30.893
Son of a bitch! They found us!

38:53.207 --> 38:54.792
Come on, son!

39:37.168 --> 39:40.046
- Sir, are you OK?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

39:40.129 --> 39:42.381
- He's trying to get away!
- He won't get away.

39:42.465 --> 39:44.216
Get me a radio, quick!

39:44.300 --> 39:46.427
Correal, bring a radio!
Correal! A radio!

39:47.595 --> 39:50.973
Dad, let's go! Hurry, Dad, hurry!

39:53.309 --> 39:55.019
Hurry!

40:04.236 --> 40:05.237
Stop!

40:20.669 --> 40:23.923
Pefia! Gacha is in a red Chevy pick-up!

40:29.845 --> 40:32.598
What did I tell you?
We got out OK.

40:32.681 --> 40:35.309
- I'm scared.
- Scared of what?

40:35.392 --> 40:37.228
You're a wolf, right?

40:37.311 --> 40:39.396
Yes, I am a wolf.

40:48.614 --> 40:51.033
It's a helicopter! It's a helicopter!
They're going to kill us!

40:51.242 --> 40:53.494
Nobody is going to kill us!
Don't talk like that!

40:53.577 --> 40:55.496
Take this. Take it!

40:59.750 --> 41:02.419
- I have a Chevy in sight.
- Stop him!

41:02.628 --> 41:05.798
<i>Don't let him get away!
Try and disable the vehicle!</i>

41:24.900 --> 41:27.611
<i>No good. We're going in again.</i>

41:27.695 --> 41:30.531
Stop him!
Do whatever you have to do!

41:33.951 --> 41:38.122
- Don't leave me alone, Dad.
- No, no. Never, son, never!

41:38.205 --> 41:41.000
Breathe! Breathe!

41:41.083 --> 41:44.753
Do you want this, asshole?
Do you want this?

41:44.962 --> 41:48.716
We're taking fire. We'll circle around
and approach from another direction.

41:48.924 --> 41:53.053
You don't need to worry about anything,
my son. Nothing.

41:53.262 --> 41:56.724
<i>Don't take any chances!
We can't afford to lose him!</i>

41:56.807 --> 41:57.975
COPY-

42:00.102 --> 42:03.022
Look. Look outside. Look outside!

42:07.526 --> 42:10.279
<i>What's happening?
Peña, what's happening?</i>

42:17.536 --> 42:20.247
We stopped him.
He's not moving.

42:23.500 --> 42:25.252
Freddy. Freddy?

42:25.336 --> 42:27.171
Let's go, Freddy.

42:27.880 --> 42:29.089
Freddy?

42:29.882 --> 42:31.300
Freddy?

42:31.383 --> 42:33.177
Son!

42:38.933 --> 42:41.685
You're a wolf. You're a wolf.

42:45.022 --> 42:46.482
Asshole!

42:46.565 --> 42:49.526
Asshole! Hey, asshole!

42:49.693 --> 42:51.487
Freddy! Wake up, Freddy!

42:53.489 --> 42:55.282
Hey, asshole!
What are you going to do?

42:55.491 --> 42:58.285
What are you going to do?
Asshole!

42:58.494 --> 43:01.247
What are you going to do?!

43:04.166 --> 43:07.169
<i>He's out of bullets.
We can take him alive.</i>

43:09.838 --> 43:11.757
<i>It's your call.</i>

43:20.557 --> 43:22.017
Give him lead.

43:42.288 --> 43:46.917
Affirmative. Maintain positions
and patrol the area again. Very good.

44:00.264 --> 44:01.640
Are you OK?

44:21.368 --> 44:24.413
According to recent polls,
we're doing well.

44:24.496 --> 44:27.291
We're gaining more points
in six districts within Cali.

44:28.083 --> 44:31.545
They're important
because we could gain the lead.

44:31.628 --> 44:34.631
- Don't put too much faith in the polls.
- I know.

44:34.715 --> 44:37.634
The last time,
we fell five points in one day.

44:37.718 --> 44:38.552
Yes.

44:39.762 --> 44:41.263
Stop him!
Sir, we can't let you through!

44:41.472 --> 44:43.349
Relax. Let him through.

45:28.102 --> 45:29.853
You nervous?

45:29.937 --> 45:32.314
A little bit, but I'm fine.

45:32.398 --> 45:34.274
Wait here.

45:34.358 --> 45:36.485
You know what you have to do?

45:36.568 --> 45:38.362
Yes, sir.

45:41.865 --> 45:45.661
Remember, you have to record
the entire conversation. Don't forget.

45:45.869 --> 45:49.331
- No, sir.
- Have a nice flight.

45:49.415 --> 45:51.333
Aren't you coming with me?

45:51.417 --> 45:56.713
No, the boss just told me
to bring you here.

45:56.797 --> 45:58.757
But don't worry.

45:58.841 --> 46:01.468
Tomorrow, I'll come and meet you there.

46:01.552 --> 46:05.681
- All right, then.
- All right. Don't be nervous.

46:05.764 --> 46:07.599
You'll see how fun it is to fly.

46:08.684 --> 46:10.144
All right?

46:10.978 --> 46:13.689
Go on. The line is right there.

46:13.772 --> 46:15.649
Good luck, then.

46:23.991 --> 46:26.118
It's up to you, Eduardo.

46:26.201 --> 46:28.871
Whatever you decide, I'll do.

46:29.955 --> 46:33.959
<i>Avianca announces the departure
of Flight 203 to Cali,</i>

46:34.042 --> 46:36.503
<i>now boarding at Gate 6.</i>

46:46.346 --> 46:49.308
I'll organize the exit.
You guys stay with him.

47:06.617 --> 47:08.827
Put on your seatbelt, please.
