I have to tell you.
Henri is married.

00:15.885 --> 00:18.148
That doesn't make any sense.

00:18.192 --> 00:20.585
We separated five years ago,

00:20.629 --> 00:23.371
but in the midst of the divorce,
she was diagnosed with MS,

00:23.414 --> 00:25.851
so we decided
to stay married

00:25.895 --> 00:28.550
so she could stay
on my health insurance.

00:28.593 --> 00:29.812
I'm sorry.

00:29.855 --> 00:31.683
How did you find out?

00:31.727 --> 00:33.250
I did a background check
on you.

00:33.294 --> 00:34.991
I guess neither of us
is having lunch today.

You need

drinking in your truck.

01:36.357 --> 01:37.880
Raf, is this true?

01:37.923 --> 01:40.056
No. No, that's ridiculous.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.058
I can smell it on you, Raf.

01:48.891 --> 01:50.632
It was only one drink.

Yeah. The jockey.
What's he doing at Rikers?

It's been way too long.

05:24.759 --> 05:27.283
Whatever... God,
whatever they think he did,

05:27.327 --> 05:29.720
there has to be some type
of mistake. I have to help him.

Yes, I know it's a mistake,
and you will help him,

05:32.375 --> 05:35.073

accept visitors

05:36.292 --> 05:37.772

I can't just let Raf sit there
all alone.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.906

try to get in.

What do you want me to do? Call
Taylor and have her take Astrid

06:31.434 --> 06:34.045

I-I went on a...

06:34.089 --> 06:36.004
a bit of a bender.

06:36.047 --> 06:39.181

and the prosecution is gonna say

that you are a drunk
who got fired

06:42.227 --> 06:44.186

on your former boss.

06:49.844 --> 06:52.629
Look, I-I know it sounds stupid,

06:52.673 --> 06:55.719
but I went to Bridleright to beg
Mr. Sinclair for my job back.

06:55.763 --> 06:57.155
It seemed like
a good idea

06:57.199 --> 06:58.548

06:58.592 --> 07:00.420
But when I got there,

07:00.463 --> 07:01.856
the stable was on fire.

07:01.899 --> 07:03.161
What happened to your hands?

07:04.162 --> 07:06.426
I tried to open the doors.

07:06.469 --> 07:09.385
Bold Spirit was inside.
I had to save him.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.431

07:11.474 --> 07:12.823
it was too much.

It was... awful.

But I-I must have driven
in a ditch or something,

07:30.493 --> 07:32.452

07:32.495 --> 07:34.410
a police officer's pulling me
out of my truck.

He owes me a favor,

07:58.216 --> 08:01.045
he can arrange one of his best
attorneys to be on your case.

08:14.842 --> 08:16.800

to help him.

08:16.844 --> 08:19.673
Rafael needs someone
to negotiate a plea deal,

08:19.716 --> 08:21.326
and that is what
public defenders do.

08:21.370 --> 08:23.241
He doesn't need a plea deal.
He's innocent.

08:23.285 --> 08:25.069
He needs you
to prove that.

08:25.113 --> 08:27.507
This is a system case,
and the public defender's office

08:27.550 --> 08:28.899
is gonna give him
a good defense.

08:28.943 --> 08:31.641
Rafael has been
in the system his entire life.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.556
I don't want him
in the system this time.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.253
[sighs] You think he's guilty,
and that's why

08:35.297 --> 08:36.951
you've been interrogating him
the whole time.

08:36.994 --> 08:37.865
He was found drunk at
the scene of the crime.

08:37.908 --> 08:39.780
He has a hell of a motive.

08:39.823 --> 08:40.998

like he did it.He didn't do it.

08:48.310 --> 08:50.268

you never see coming.

08:50.312 --> 08:52.662
No. I've known him
since he was 14.

08:52.706 --> 08:54.882
I know his soul.

He's not vengeful.
He's not... he's not violent.

08:58.015 --> 09:00.583
He doesn't have a case.
Plea deal's the best option.

09:00.627 --> 09:04.674
No. His best option is for TAC
to prove that he's innocent.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.763
And I'm willing to pay for it.

This isn't about the money.No.

10:10.784 --> 10:12.437
Got the preliminary report
this morning.

10:12.481 --> 10:13.917
There's no definitive proof
it was arson.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.963
Great. What's our expert say?

10:16.006 --> 10:18.269
Anything we can point to
to say this was an accident?

10:18.313 --> 10:20.358
He's just finishing up.
We should head over...

10:20.402 --> 10:22.360
GARRETT:
Can I help you?

10:22.404 --> 10:24.188
Uh, you two go ahead.
I've got this.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.985
Mind telling me who you are
and what you're doing here?

10:38.028 --> 10:39.813
My name is Marissa Morgan.

10:39.856 --> 10:41.815
I work with the legal team
representing Rafael Ramirez.

10:44.034 --> 10:46.602
This is my property.
You need to leave.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.083
We will get out of your hair
as quickly as possible.

10:49.126 --> 10:50.824
I know this must be a very
difficult time for you.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.695
Ugh. Difficult's
an understatement.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.436
Lauren Parker was a good friend.

10:54.479 --> 10:57.657
And Bold Spirit was... oh.

10:58.701 --> 11:00.703
Bold Spirit was quite a horse.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.662
At the Breeders' Cup last year,

11:02.705 --> 11:04.402
he ran like he was shot
out of a cannon.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.362
You follow racing?

11:07.405 --> 11:08.798
Here and there.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.321
Then you know.

11:10.365 --> 11:13.629
Bold Spirit was
the kind of horse that...

11:13.673 --> 11:15.849
only comes along
once in a lifetime.

11:17.154 --> 11:19.809
Mind if I ask,
these tracks--

11:19.853 --> 11:21.071
are they from Rafael's truck?

11:21.115 --> 11:23.073
Yes.

11:23.117 --> 11:25.728
Looks like he was driving
towards your house.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.209
And your point is?

11:28.252 --> 11:29.732
It seems to me, if Rafael
had set the fire,

11:29.776 --> 11:30.907
he would have been driving
towards the exit,

11:30.951 --> 11:32.343
not towards your house.

11:32.387 --> 11:34.258
Ms. Morgan, do you have any idea

11:34.302 --> 11:35.651
how drunk
Rafael was that night?

11:35.695 --> 11:37.479
I understand he was inebriated.

11:37.522 --> 11:39.220
He was barely conscious.

11:39.263 --> 11:40.743
I doubt he had any idea

11:40.787 --> 11:42.136
wherehe was driving.

11:42.179 --> 11:43.833
Being an addict

11:43.877 --> 11:45.748
and being an arsonist
aren't the same thing.

11:45.792 --> 11:50.100
Listen, I've sat where you are
now, wanting to believe him.

11:50.144 --> 11:52.494
But this isn't the first time
Rafael has screwed up.

11:52.537 --> 11:54.844
Screwed up how?I've bailed him out of trouble

11:54.888 --> 11:58.065
because of his drinking
more than once.

11:59.327 --> 12:00.894
I wanted to help.

12:00.937 --> 12:02.765
Look what that got me.

12:05.333 --> 12:07.378
As soon
as your work is finished,

12:07.422 --> 12:09.816
I'd appreciate you
seeing yourself off my farm.

12:14.385 --> 12:16.344
Well, that looked
unpleasant.

12:16.387 --> 12:18.520
The man lost a lot.

12:18.563 --> 12:20.696
Any love from our expert?

12:20.740 --> 12:23.133
Another inconclusive. Nothing
to say it was an accident,

12:23.177 --> 12:24.918
and nothing to say it wasn't.

12:24.961 --> 12:26.833
All I hear is, the
prosecution doesn't have

12:26.876 --> 12:28.922
any direct evidence
that this was arson.

12:28.965 --> 12:31.185
That's something
I can work with.

12:31.228 --> 12:33.535
That is something,
but we may have another problem.

12:33.578 --> 12:36.190
According to Mr. Sinclair,
this is not the first time

12:36.233 --> 12:38.758
that Rafael's drinking
has gotten him in trouble.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.805
CHUNK:
Your Honor, Mr. Ramirez's
previous conduct

12:42.849 --> 12:45.939
is clearly inadmissible under
the prior bad acts exclusion.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.767
There are many exceptions
to that rule.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.290
None of which apply here.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.814
The prosecutor is saying
that because my client

12:51.858 --> 12:53.207
got drunk and broke
the law before,

12:53.250 --> 12:55.296
that he must have
done it again here now.

12:55.339 --> 12:56.863
It is the very definition

12:56.906 --> 12:58.212
of inadmissible
character evidence.

12:58.255 --> 13:00.083
On two separate occasions,

13:00.127 --> 13:03.217
the defendant assaulted someone
while intoxicated.

13:03.260 --> 13:05.915
This pattern of vengeful
behavior is highly probative

13:05.959 --> 13:07.961
to the issue of intent,
Your Honor.

13:08.004 --> 13:10.006
Two bar fights do not equate

13:10.050 --> 13:11.965
to intentionally
setting a barn on fire

13:12.008 --> 13:13.923
and killing a person
and a horse.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.359
MARTIN:
Your Honor, these incidents

13:15.403 --> 13:16.752
show an escalation that's...

13:16.796 --> 13:17.840
Hold on, Ms. Martin.

13:17.884 --> 13:21.409
Are we boring you, Mr. Ramirez?

13:21.452 --> 13:23.150
[clears throat]

13:23.193 --> 13:27.241
Mr. Ramirez,
I'm talking to you.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.634
Oh, my client is-is merely
nervous, Your Honor.

13:29.678 --> 13:30.810
He meant no disrespect.

13:30.853 --> 13:32.812
Does your client speak?

13:34.291 --> 13:36.337
Uh, I'm sorry, Your Honor.

13:36.380 --> 13:39.035
I'm just nervous,
like Mr. Palmer said.

13:44.998 --> 13:48.610
I believe these prior acts
are probative as to intent.

13:48.653 --> 13:50.133
I will allow them.

13:50.177 --> 13:52.266
Thank you, Your Honor.Mr. Ramirez,

13:52.309 --> 13:54.485
you stand accused
of a very serious crime.

13:54.529 --> 13:57.010
You might want
to pay more attention.

13:59.229 --> 14:01.710
IZZY:
Mr. Ramirez? Mr. Ramirez?

14:01.753 --> 14:04.365
That judge might as well
have called him "Señor."

14:04.408 --> 14:05.888
Izzy, it was odd, absolutely,

14:05.932 --> 14:07.368
but you have
to understand...No, no.

14:07.411 --> 14:08.848
My Tía Rosa
with her collection

14:08.891 --> 14:10.458
of porcelain
cat figurines is odd.

14:10.501 --> 14:13.069
This was outrageous.

14:13.113 --> 14:14.636
He's racist.

14:14.679 --> 14:16.768
We don't know that.Oh. I do.

14:16.812 --> 14:18.074
[whirring]

14:18.118 --> 14:19.815
That judge is biased
against Raf,

14:19.859 --> 14:20.947
and you have
to get him off the case.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.862
Just like that? Remove a judge?

14:22.905 --> 14:24.689
Well, Raf is never gonna get

14:24.733 --> 14:26.909
a fair trial with that jerk,
and you know it.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.302
Well, it is
incredibly difficult

14:28.345 --> 14:29.825
to get a judge
kicked off for prejudice.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.522
Well, so? We got to try.

14:31.566 --> 14:33.698
I'm the only person that's ever
been in Raf's corner,

14:33.742 --> 14:35.309
and I'm not going down
without a fight.

14:37.485 --> 14:39.269
I get that, but...

14:40.531 --> 14:44.622
I said, I get that,
but if we make the accusation,

14:44.666 --> 14:46.624
and we don't succeed
in getting Judge Grant removed,

14:46.668 --> 14:48.452
we still have to try the case,

14:48.496 --> 14:50.541
except this time with a judge
who's very pissed off with us.

14:50.585 --> 14:52.587
So there's nothing we could do?

14:52.630 --> 14:55.068
Well, Taylor is looking into
Judge Grant's previous rulings

14:55.111 --> 14:57.070
to see if there's a pattern
of prejudice,

14:57.113 --> 14:59.550
especially
against Latinx defendants,

14:59.594 --> 15:00.987
but it's gonna take some time.

15:01.030 --> 15:02.989
Okay, and until then?

15:03.032 --> 15:05.556
We start telling our story.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.081
What happened to Lauren Parker

15:08.124 --> 15:11.040
and Bold Spirit
was undoubtedly tragic.

15:11.084 --> 15:13.695
It was also
a tragic accident.

15:13.738 --> 15:15.436
You won't hear any evidence

15:15.479 --> 15:19.440
proving that this fire started
as a result of arson

15:19.483 --> 15:21.529
because the prosecution
doesn't have any.

15:21.572 --> 15:22.965
And you'll hear no evidence

15:23.009 --> 15:25.098
whatsoever that Mr. Ramirez

15:25.141 --> 15:29.537
started that fire
because... he didn't.

15:29.580 --> 15:30.973
How's Chunk doing?

15:31.017 --> 15:32.757
Uh, it's a strong
opening argument.

15:32.801 --> 15:34.324
[phone chimes]

15:35.847 --> 15:37.371
You waiting for something?

15:37.414 --> 15:40.330
[sighs]
I texted Henri again
this morning.

15:40.374 --> 15:42.332
I was just hoping...

15:42.376 --> 15:44.378
He still hasn't
talked to you?

15:44.421 --> 15:47.381
No, not since... you know.

15:47.424 --> 15:49.383
I'm so sorry.
I feel so responsible.

15:49.426 --> 15:51.472
What's done is done.
You and I are good.

15:51.515 --> 15:53.691
I just...

15:53.735 --> 15:55.998
I hate that he thinks
so poorly of me.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.522
I didn't even get
to explain myself.

15:58.566 --> 16:00.002
So explain yourself.

16:00.046 --> 16:02.918
How? He's not responding to me.Come on.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.528
You figured out a way
to make Bull listen to you,

16:04.572 --> 16:06.356
and now you're a partner in TAC.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.054
Think you can figure out a way
to get through to Henri.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.229
[phone buzzing and ringing]

16:09.272 --> 16:11.492
Oh.

16:11.535 --> 16:13.320
Hey, Danny. What's up?

16:14.321 --> 16:16.845
Oh, no.

16:16.888 --> 16:20.849
Lauren Parker was Mr. Ramirez's
colleague and friend.

16:20.892 --> 16:24.331
And Bold Spirit was his partner.
He had absolutely

16:24.374 --> 16:27.595
no motive
to harm either one of them.

16:27.638 --> 16:28.944
MARISSA:
Bull, uh,

16:28.988 --> 16:29.771
you need to go out in the hall.

16:29.814 --> 16:31.512
Talk to Danny.

16:31.555 --> 16:33.470
Chunk hasn't finished
his opening statements.

16:33.514 --> 16:34.776
Go now.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.169
He never would have

16:36.212 --> 16:38.736
intentionally set that fire.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.347
No one did.[whispering]:
Where are you going?

16:40.390 --> 16:42.001
It was an accident.

16:46.179 --> 16:47.963
What's going on?

16:48.007 --> 16:48.964
Sorry to pull you out of court,

16:49.008 --> 16:50.792
but the police just executed

16:50.835 --> 16:52.620
a search warrant on
a storage unit in Rafael's name.

16:52.663 --> 16:53.925
What does that mean?

16:53.969 --> 16:55.405
They're looking for something.

16:55.449 --> 16:57.973
Yeah. An accelerant.I thought

16:58.017 --> 17:00.367
the fire experts didn't find
any accelerant in the barn.

17:00.410 --> 17:02.760
Well, the local fire department
amended their report.

17:02.804 --> 17:04.066
They just got back some labs

17:04.110 --> 17:05.981
that identified traces
of acetone

17:06.025 --> 17:07.113
in samples taken
from the stable.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.679
And let me guess.

17:08.723 --> 17:12.031
They found acetone
in Rafael's storage unit.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.597
Splashes of it on the floor.

17:13.641 --> 17:15.512
As if it was stored
there, and now...

17:15.556 --> 17:17.253
It's gone.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.255
Why'd you leave?
I was killing it in there.

17:19.299 --> 17:21.475
Yes, you were.
Great opening.

17:21.518 --> 17:24.391
And now you're gonna have
to make the jury forget it.

17:24.434 --> 17:26.001
What are you talking about?

17:26.045 --> 17:27.829
Well, you told 'em
the fire was an accident,

17:27.872 --> 17:31.050
but now the prosecution
has proof that it was arson.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.051
[sighs]

17:33.356 --> 17:36.055
And our whole defense
just went up in flames.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.675
So, why did they find acetone
residue in your storage unit?

17:47.718 --> 17:50.591
My ex used to leave some of her
stuff there from her nail salon,

17:50.634 --> 17:53.246
but I haven't been
to that storage unit in months.

17:53.289 --> 17:57.206
We can't prove that.
Place is self-access.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.252
So, what does
this mean now?

17:59.295 --> 18:00.601
It means that the jury
is gonna have a hard time

18:00.644 --> 18:01.819
seeing you didn't
start that fire.

18:01.863 --> 18:03.125
But I didn't.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.127
[sighs]

18:06.433 --> 18:08.435
You don't believe me, do you?Look, it doesn't matter

18:08.478 --> 18:10.045
if I don't believe you.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.743
It matters what we can prove.

18:12.787 --> 18:14.745
That means
you don't believe me.[sighs]: Raf.

18:14.789 --> 18:16.617
And if you don't believe me,
the jury sure as hell won't.

18:16.660 --> 18:17.922
Hey.
I'm going to prison,
aren't I?

18:17.966 --> 18:19.663
We don't know that.Why did I have

18:19.707 --> 18:21.100
to get drunk that day?
Why am I such a screwup?Calm down.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.492
Hey, hey!

18:22.536 --> 18:24.668
Look at me.

18:24.712 --> 18:27.454
You need to keep it together,
especially when we're in court.

18:30.718 --> 18:33.460
You never wanted
a drink that bad?[sighs]

18:33.503 --> 18:35.940
Yeah.

18:35.984 --> 18:39.770
I know moments of weakness
can trigger negative actions.

18:40.771 --> 18:42.121
Yeah.

18:42.164 --> 18:43.644
You got to stay sober.

18:43.687 --> 18:44.819
When was the last time
you went to a meeting?

18:44.862 --> 18:47.691
Has it been a long time?

18:47.735 --> 18:49.563
A while.Okay.

18:49.606 --> 18:52.914
Most important thing in
your life right now is sobriety.

18:52.957 --> 18:55.960
So after court, you go?

18:56.004 --> 18:58.311
I will.

18:58.354 --> 18:59.660
Good.

18:59.703 --> 19:01.357
I made a promise to Izzy.

19:01.401 --> 19:05.709
Oh. Well, then, yeah,
in that case,

19:05.753 --> 19:07.146
God help you
if you don't keep it.

19:14.718 --> 19:16.764
I'm sorry, but Operation
Judgy Judge was a bust.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.200
Operation Judgy Judge?

19:18.244 --> 19:19.941
My deep dive into Judge Grant.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.986
I checked his sentencing history
of Latino

19:22.030 --> 19:24.511
versus non-Latino defendants
and found no evidence

19:24.554 --> 19:25.512
of racial bias.None at all?

19:25.555 --> 19:26.991
In fact, he's slightly

19:27.035 --> 19:28.167
more lenient towards Latinos.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.474
I would've bet money
that he was biased

19:31.518 --> 19:33.128
based on how he talked
to Rafael.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.957
Maybe Rafael reminds him
of someone from his past.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.524
I can look into that.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.178
No, I don't want to send you
on a wild goose chase.

19:39.221 --> 19:40.614
Sometimes you get a bad ref.

19:40.657 --> 19:42.355
You still have to play to win.

19:42.398 --> 19:43.834
I think our best move is
to find someone else

19:43.878 --> 19:45.532
who had motive
to burn down that barn.

19:45.575 --> 19:47.098
Oh, I already did that.

19:47.142 --> 19:49.840
What?

19:49.884 --> 19:50.972
What'd you find?

19:54.193 --> 19:56.325
Rafael said
I'd regret firing him.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.066
He wanted to hurt me.

19:58.109 --> 20:00.460
Setting that fire,
killing Bold Spirit,

20:00.503 --> 20:03.158
was his way of doing that.
I don't know if he even

20:03.202 --> 20:05.334
realized Lauren was in the barn.

20:08.424 --> 20:12.254
It's still hard for me
to believe she's gone, too.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.343
Thank you, Mr. Sinclair.

20:14.387 --> 20:15.866
Nothing further, Your Honor.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.128
Your witness, Mr. Palmer.

20:17.172 --> 20:18.652
[exhales]

20:18.695 --> 20:20.654
CHUNK:
Mr. Sinclair,

20:20.697 --> 20:23.222
six months ago,
another one of your horses,

20:23.265 --> 20:25.963
Gold Rush, died prematurely,
is that correct?

20:26.007 --> 20:27.356
Um, yes.

20:27.400 --> 20:30.098
Actually,
he was my husband's horse.

20:30.141 --> 20:32.753
I got Gold Rush for Noah
when he retired

20:32.796 --> 20:35.146
from his veterinary
practice. We were

20:35.190 --> 20:37.888
both devastated by his loss.

20:37.932 --> 20:41.196
And did you file an insurance
claim upon Gold Rush's death?

20:41.240 --> 20:43.807
Yes. It might seem strange

20:43.851 --> 20:47.463
to insure a pet,
but Gold Rush

20:47.507 --> 20:49.422
wasn't just a pet.
He was a thoroughbred racehorse.

20:49.465 --> 20:51.119
Very expensive.

20:51.162 --> 20:55.689
And what was the payout
from Gold Rush's policy?

20:55.732 --> 20:57.778
$1 million, but

20:57.821 --> 20:58.996
no amount of money could

20:59.040 --> 21:01.172
replace him in Noah's heart.

21:01.216 --> 21:03.610
Noah was crazy about that horse.

21:03.653 --> 21:05.220
Whose side are you on?

21:05.264 --> 21:06.221
CHUNK:
What about Bold Spirit?

21:06.265 --> 21:07.222
Champion racer.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.484
You must have taken out

21:08.528 --> 21:10.399
a much bigger policy for him.

21:10.443 --> 21:12.662
Objection.
Leading the witness.I'll rephrase.

21:12.706 --> 21:14.098
Please do.

21:14.142 --> 21:16.666
What's the insurance payout
going

21:16.710 --> 21:18.451
to be for Bold Spirit?

21:18.494 --> 21:20.104
$5 million.

21:20.148 --> 21:21.410
[gallery murmuring]

21:21.454 --> 21:23.499
GARRETT:
But that doesn't

21:23.543 --> 21:25.893
even begin to cover
what we would have earned

21:25.936 --> 21:27.416
had he kept racing.

21:27.460 --> 21:29.288
You mean,
had he kept winning, right?

21:29.331 --> 21:31.246
Bold Spirit
won the last

21:31.290 --> 21:34.031
seven of his stakes races.

21:34.075 --> 21:36.425
People were talking about his
chances at the Triple Crown.

21:36.469 --> 21:38.297
Sure,
but a winning streak can end

21:38.340 --> 21:39.950
just as quickly as it began.

21:39.994 --> 21:42.518
Perhaps you were trying
to guarantee a windfall,

21:42.562 --> 21:43.954
and so you killed the horse
yourself.

21:43.998 --> 21:46.914
Objection, Your Honor.
Counsel is testifying.

21:46.957 --> 21:49.090
He sure is. I object, too.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.265
[quietly]:
You object?

21:50.309 --> 21:51.962
Excuse me, Your Honor?

21:52.006 --> 21:54.400
I've let your fishing expedition
go on long enough.

21:54.443 --> 21:56.271
Your cross is over, Mr. Palmer.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.317
Due respect of the court,
Your Honor, but I'm not finished

21:58.360 --> 22:00.101
with Mr. Sinclair.Yes, you are.

22:00.144 --> 22:02.321
CHUNK:
Your Honor, you cannot
deny me the opportunity

22:02.364 --> 22:04.279
to cross-examine
a prosecution witness.

22:04.323 --> 22:07.500
I can, and I did.
Take a seat.

22:08.762 --> 22:10.067
No.

22:10.111 --> 22:11.547
Not until

22:11.591 --> 22:12.983
I'm finished.

22:13.027 --> 22:14.463
This witness is excused.

22:14.507 --> 22:17.727
Counsel in my chambers. Now.

22:21.296 --> 22:22.732
[gallery murmuring]

22:25.213 --> 22:26.475
[whispering]:
What's the problem?

22:26.519 --> 22:28.172
Well, I guess
Rafael isn't the only one

22:28.216 --> 22:30.305
the judge has it
in for now.

22:33.221 --> 22:34.744
[whimpers]Mr. Palmer,

22:34.788 --> 22:37.965
your treatment
of that witness was repugnant.

22:38.008 --> 22:40.750
Garrett Sinclair
is the victim here.

22:40.794 --> 22:42.578
Garrett Sinclair is a witness
and a possible suspect.

22:42.622 --> 22:45.494
Mr. Sinclair didn't just lose

22:45.538 --> 22:47.714
his employee.
He lost his beloved horse.

22:47.757 --> 22:49.498
I won't have you badgering him
in my courtroom.

22:49.542 --> 22:50.978
CHUNK:
Your Honor,

22:51.021 --> 22:54.024
respectfully,
Lauren Parker and Bold Spirit

22:54.068 --> 22:57.419
are the only two victims
in this entire case.

22:57.463 --> 23:00.335
That man is in mourning.
Don't you have any compassion?

23:00.379 --> 23:02.119
I have compassion
for my client

23:02.163 --> 23:03.686
who's been wrongfully accused

23:03.730 --> 23:05.384
and deserves the best defense
that I can give him.

23:05.427 --> 23:08.691
GRANT:
I can't even imagine
how devastated I'd be

23:08.735 --> 23:10.389
if anything like that happened
to my Lucy.

23:10.432 --> 23:12.782
If I'm not allowed to continue
my cross-examination,

23:12.826 --> 23:15.437
I'm going to file an immediate
interlocutory appeal!

23:15.481 --> 23:16.830
We're not gonna do that.

23:16.873 --> 23:18.701
And I want
to apologize profusely

23:18.745 --> 23:20.442
for our insensitivity here.

23:20.486 --> 23:21.617
It will never
happen again,

23:21.661 --> 23:23.619
Your Honor.
Mr. Palmer, shall we?

23:25.142 --> 23:28.537
[door opens]

23:29.843 --> 23:32.628
What the hell was that? You just
cut me off at the knees.

23:32.672 --> 23:35.152
Did you see his dog?What?

23:35.196 --> 23:38.286
Lucy? Judge Grant's dog.

23:38.329 --> 23:39.809
The man's an animal lover.

23:39.853 --> 23:42.377
And he thinks
that Rafael killed a horse.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.770
That's why he's being
so hard on him.

23:43.813 --> 23:46.468
He thinks it's worse
to kill an animal than a person?

23:46.512 --> 23:48.209
I don't know
if he thinks it's worse,

23:48.252 --> 23:50.472
but the man's got
a soft spot. He's...

23:50.516 --> 23:54.607
polluting the jury right now
with his contempt for Rafael.

23:54.650 --> 23:58.654
If we want to win them over,
we need to win him over first.

23:58.698 --> 24:00.439
Shall I go back in there
and sweet-talk him some more?

24:00.482 --> 24:03.442
No, we got to put Rafael on
the stand, and he has to testify

24:03.485 --> 24:06.009
about how much he loves horses.

24:06.053 --> 24:07.837
And the judge will never believe

24:07.881 --> 24:09.578
that he would burn down a barn
with a horse in it.

24:09.622 --> 24:12.494
Rafael's fragile. You think
he's gonna hold up on cross?

24:12.538 --> 24:14.104
Better than he's gonna hold up
in prison.

24:18.326 --> 24:21.024
[footsteps approaching]

24:21.068 --> 24:22.983
Forgive me, but
we're closing.

24:24.463 --> 24:27.074
I promise I won't keep you long.

24:27.117 --> 24:29.032
Marissa,
what are you doing here?

24:29.076 --> 24:31.034
You said the reason
you didn't tell me

24:31.078 --> 24:33.036
you were still married
is because

24:33.080 --> 24:36.910
you didn't want to burden a new
relationship with old wounds.

24:36.953 --> 24:40.087
And the irony is
that I burdened our relationship

24:40.130 --> 24:41.262
with my old wounds.

24:41.305 --> 24:43.307
I-I'm not sure I understand.

24:43.351 --> 24:46.223
I consider myself
to be a smart woman,

24:46.267 --> 24:48.835
but I have been deceived

24:48.878 --> 24:50.880
by men quite a few times.

24:50.924 --> 24:53.492
Well, we've all been lied to
at some point.

24:53.535 --> 24:55.755
A con man stole all of my money.

24:55.798 --> 24:58.845
My ex-husband nearly got me
sent to prison for his crimes.

24:58.888 --> 25:00.281
And that was
after I divorced him

25:00.324 --> 25:03.327
and married him
for a second time.

25:04.372 --> 25:07.288
I'm sorry that happened to you.

25:07.331 --> 25:11.945
My point is
that all of this has left me

25:11.988 --> 25:16.471
a little wary of things
that seem too good to be true.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.213
That's why
I investigated you.

25:19.256 --> 25:21.215
I see.

25:21.258 --> 25:22.651
It wasn't fair for me

25:22.695 --> 25:26.046
to project my past onto you.

25:26.089 --> 25:28.091
So...

25:28.135 --> 25:30.311
please forgive me.

25:31.747 --> 25:33.532
Henri...

25:34.968 --> 25:36.665
Um...

25:36.709 --> 25:37.753
Oh.

25:39.929 --> 25:41.148
You're busy.

25:41.191 --> 25:42.410
Marissa...Uh,

25:42.453 --> 25:45.108
I'm interrupting,
and I'm gonna go.

25:50.853 --> 25:52.159
Okay.

25:55.118 --> 25:56.598
[gavel bangs]

25:57.643 --> 25:59.601
Horses saved my life.

25:59.645 --> 26:01.603
Can you please tell
the court what you mean

26:01.647 --> 26:03.213
when you say
they saved your life?

26:03.257 --> 26:05.346
I moved to this country
from Puerto Rico

26:05.389 --> 26:06.695
when I was 12 years old.

26:06.739 --> 26:09.350
I didn't speak
the same language

26:09.393 --> 26:11.439
as the other kids
at school, didn't

26:11.482 --> 26:13.789
have any friends.
Home wasn't any easier.

26:13.833 --> 26:15.748
My father was abusive.

26:15.791 --> 26:17.924
Well, that sounds like
a lot for a boy to carry.

26:17.967 --> 26:20.013
How did horses come
into your life?

26:20.056 --> 26:23.582
I-I got assigned a mentor at the
Puerto Rican Community Center.

26:23.625 --> 26:26.193
My mentor-- she did
all sorts of things with me.

26:26.236 --> 26:29.588
One day, she took me to
these stables for a trail ride.

26:29.631 --> 26:33.374
Horses-- they don't care
what country you come from,

26:33.417 --> 26:37.117
what language you speak,
or even if your dad hits you.

26:37.160 --> 26:39.641
They just need you to
love and care for them.

26:39.685 --> 26:42.426
And when you do,
they love you in return.

26:42.470 --> 26:46.213
CHUNK:
And this love
you have for horses--

26:46.256 --> 26:48.781
it led to a career
with them, right?

26:48.824 --> 26:50.609
Yes.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.219
I mucked the stalls and

26:52.262 --> 26:55.222
groomed the horses
in exchange for riding lessons.

26:55.265 --> 26:57.441
It came pretty naturally to me,

26:57.485 --> 26:59.922
and, uh, the owner
of the stables-- he noticed.

26:59.966 --> 27:02.621
He sponsored my training
to become a jockey.

27:02.664 --> 27:04.840
I never could've
dreamed I'd spend

27:04.884 --> 27:06.842
my life working with horses.

27:06.886 --> 27:08.278
He's doing well.

27:08.322 --> 27:09.715
Extremely well.

27:09.758 --> 27:11.630
CHUNK:
Mr. Ramirez,

27:11.673 --> 27:14.241
did you set the fire
that killed Lauren Parker

27:14.284 --> 27:15.677
and Bold Spirit?

27:15.721 --> 27:17.766
No.

27:17.810 --> 27:19.289
No. Lauren was my friend.

27:19.333 --> 27:20.769
And she was always
very good to me.

27:20.813 --> 27:22.728
Bold Spirit was my partner.

27:22.771 --> 27:24.773
I loved him.

27:27.820 --> 27:29.604
I can't believe
that they're gone.

27:31.345 --> 27:33.216
And I couldn't live with myself

27:33.260 --> 27:34.609
if I had been the one
who killed them.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.829
Thank you, Mr. Ramirez.

27:36.872 --> 27:38.787
No further questions,
Your Honor.

27:39.788 --> 27:41.224
Let's, uh,

27:41.268 --> 27:43.879
take a brief recess
for lunch and

27:43.923 --> 27:45.576
pick up with Ms. Martin's
cross-examination

27:45.620 --> 27:47.709
when we return.

27:54.890 --> 27:56.675
[groans softly]

28:00.766 --> 28:04.770
Hey, we need to talk
to Rafael. Now.

28:12.821 --> 28:15.302
Let me see that bottle.What? Why?

28:15.345 --> 28:16.085
Have you been drinking?

28:16.129 --> 28:17.957
No.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.698
Let me see the bottle.Hey... it's just water.

28:21.482 --> 28:22.918
Vodka.

28:23.919 --> 28:25.355
Look, it was only

28:25.399 --> 28:27.140
a few sips to calm my nerves,
you know?

28:27.183 --> 28:28.750
It's not like
I'm drunk or anything.

28:28.794 --> 28:31.057
Bull, can I speak
to you for a second?

28:33.320 --> 28:35.235
You stay here.

28:39.108 --> 28:41.371
We can't put him back
on the stand today.Agreed.

28:41.415 --> 28:43.286
Ask for a recess until tomorrow.

28:43.330 --> 28:46.159
On what grounds?Well, I don't know.

28:46.202 --> 28:47.421
Tell the judge he ate
a bad shrimp or something.

28:47.464 --> 28:49.466
We can't lie to a judge.

28:49.510 --> 28:51.294
We don't know it's a lie.
He could have had a bad shrimp.

28:51.338 --> 28:54.341
It's a lie, and if Rafael
was drinking on the stand,

28:54.384 --> 28:55.951
I'm obligated
to inform the judge

28:55.995 --> 28:57.605
that his testimony's unreliable.

28:57.648 --> 28:59.607
Unreliable? Now wait a second.

28:59.650 --> 29:00.826
We have no reason to believe

29:00.869 --> 29:02.305
that Rafael wasn't
telling the truth.

29:02.349 --> 29:03.959
He did not
perjure himself.

29:04.003 --> 29:06.962
I'm an officer of the court,
and I have a duty, Bull.

29:07.006 --> 29:08.877
What about your duty to Rafael?

29:08.921 --> 29:12.402
When this jury finds out
that he was drunk on the stand,

29:12.446 --> 29:16.189
they're gonna hate him, and you
will have jeopardized this case.

29:16.232 --> 29:17.973
Rafael jeopardized his own case.

29:18.017 --> 29:21.411
You want to lie to a judge,
that's fine,

29:21.455 --> 29:23.936
but you'll have to find
another attorney to do it.

29:36.992 --> 29:39.342
In light
of Mr. Palmer's disclosure

29:39.386 --> 29:41.388
regarding his client's
intoxication,

29:41.431 --> 29:43.782
I must ask you,
members of the jury,

29:43.825 --> 29:45.653
to disregard

29:45.696 --> 29:48.961
the testimony
we just heard from Mr. Ramirez.

29:50.701 --> 29:53.530
IZZY:
Help me understand how
you can do this to yourself.

29:53.574 --> 29:55.532
I'm sorry, Izzy, I...

29:55.576 --> 29:57.926
You have all these people
here to help you.

29:57.970 --> 29:59.580
I'm here to help.

29:59.623 --> 30:00.407
Why can't you help yourself?

30:00.450 --> 30:02.888
I-I don't know.

30:04.193 --> 30:06.979
This is your life
on the line, Raf.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.632
It's the only one you got.I-I know.

30:08.676 --> 30:10.809
I, I-I know.

30:10.852 --> 30:13.376
Do you remember what I told you
the first time we met?

30:13.420 --> 30:14.595
Yeah, of course.

30:14.638 --> 30:16.684
Tú eres un rey, Rafael.

30:17.903 --> 30:20.035
Vaya con la cabeza bien alta.

30:20.079 --> 30:22.603
You are a king.

30:22.646 --> 30:24.648
Now go with your head held high.

30:28.914 --> 30:31.873
Well, we tried it
your way. Now what?

30:31.917 --> 30:34.354
I don't know.
I'll come up with something.

30:35.921 --> 30:37.357
Make sure he gets
home okay, will you?

30:37.400 --> 30:38.837
Yeah.

30:40.186 --> 30:42.144
How can he show up
to the stand drunk?

30:42.188 --> 30:45.017
I don't understand.
He has so much left to lose.

30:47.019 --> 30:48.977
Well, that is exactly
what happened.

30:49.021 --> 30:50.805
He was under
too much pressure.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.808
Drinking is
his coping mechanism.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.637
You know, when I first
met Raf, he was arrested

30:56.680 --> 30:58.639
for shoplifting
a candy at the bodega.

30:58.682 --> 31:01.860
And... [sighs]
he was so ashamed,

31:01.903 --> 31:05.472
and just seeing that same shame
on his face today just...

31:05.515 --> 31:07.082
it gutted me.

31:07.126 --> 31:12.044
And yet you are
still here by his side.

31:13.306 --> 31:15.264
Is it bad that I really
want a drink right now?

31:15.308 --> 31:17.310
[whispering]:
I'm glad you said it first.

31:20.443 --> 31:24.012
Hey. Sorry to hear
about Rafael today.

31:24.056 --> 31:28.060
Yeah. We started out
having a slim chance,

31:28.103 --> 31:30.105
and now we have
a slim chance in hell.

31:30.149 --> 31:31.890
Bull have any ideas
how to spin this?

31:31.933 --> 31:34.240
No. He's passed that
squarely onto me.

31:34.283 --> 31:36.503
So where are you at?I think our only hope

31:36.546 --> 31:39.332
of winning is by pointing
the finger at someone else.

31:39.375 --> 31:40.681
What? Didn't you already try
to point the finger

31:40.724 --> 31:42.465
at Garrett Sinclair?Yeah.

31:42.509 --> 31:44.728
You know, he said something
interesting on the stand

31:44.772 --> 31:46.469
that got me thinking.
He said

31:46.513 --> 31:49.472
that Bold Spirit was worth
more alive than he was dead.

31:49.516 --> 31:51.735
And if Bold Spirit is winning
all of these races

31:51.779 --> 31:53.346
and making all of this money,

31:53.389 --> 31:55.522
there's got to be some
sore losers out there, right?

31:55.565 --> 31:56.958
DANNY:
Well, yeah, there are plenty.

31:57.002 --> 31:58.351
Some of them are
especially sore

31:58.394 --> 32:00.483
because they don't think
he won fair and square.

32:00.527 --> 32:02.746
There's a rumor
that Lauren Parker--

32:02.790 --> 32:06.750
the trainer who died in the
fire-- was doping her horses.

32:06.794 --> 32:10.493
Well, if Sinclair's rivals
think that he cheated to win,

32:10.537 --> 32:12.931
robbing them of all of
that money and all that glory,

32:12.974 --> 32:14.454
that's motive right there.

32:14.497 --> 32:16.151
Sure, but it's gonna be hard

32:16.195 --> 32:17.761
to get those old money folks
to testify.

32:17.805 --> 32:18.937
They don't like airing

32:18.980 --> 32:20.590
their dirty laundry.

32:20.634 --> 32:23.115
Well, not to outsiders,
but there is someone

32:23.158 --> 32:26.857
these horse people love
to complain to.

32:26.901 --> 32:28.772
My name is Alex Garves.

32:28.816 --> 32:31.297
I'm the director of the American
Thoroughbred Racing Guild.

32:31.340 --> 32:33.168
CHUNK:And in your position
as director,

32:33.212 --> 32:35.170
do you field complaints

32:35.214 --> 32:37.346
about racehorses being given
performance-enhancing drugs?

32:37.390 --> 32:40.132
I do.Have you ever received
complaints about

32:40.175 --> 32:42.090
Bold Spirit being doped?

32:42.134 --> 32:44.179
Yes. We've received
a number of allegations

32:44.223 --> 32:45.789
that Bridleright Farms

32:45.833 --> 32:47.313
and their trainer

32:47.356 --> 32:49.010
Lauren Parker

32:49.054 --> 32:51.317
were giving Bold Spirit
performance-enhancing drugs.

32:51.360 --> 32:52.492
And did you investigate
those allegations?

32:52.535 --> 32:54.059
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance?

32:54.102 --> 32:55.712
CHUNK:
Your Honor, the Defense

32:55.756 --> 32:57.105
has the right to present others

32:57.149 --> 32:58.585
with motives
for killing Bold Spirit

32:58.628 --> 33:00.979
and Lauren Parker.

33:01.022 --> 33:02.806
I'll allow it.GARVES:
We tested

33:02.850 --> 33:04.721
Bold Spirit for the presence
of drugs in his system,

33:04.765 --> 33:06.288
but none was found.

33:06.332 --> 33:08.856
Did that stop
the complaints?No.

33:08.899 --> 33:10.292
The unfortunate reality is

33:10.336 --> 33:12.207
that drug testing
can't keep up

33:12.251 --> 33:14.209
with the availability
of new drugs on the market.

33:14.253 --> 33:16.342
The other owners were certain
that Garrett Sinclair

33:16.385 --> 33:18.344
and his trainer
Lauren Parker were cheating,

33:18.387 --> 33:19.780
but we couldn't prove it.

33:19.823 --> 33:21.173
CHUNK:
And did that make

33:21.216 --> 33:24.002
the other owners angry?Very much so.

33:24.045 --> 33:25.568
There's a lot at stake
in these races.

33:25.612 --> 33:27.092
It's not just bragging rights.

33:27.135 --> 33:29.224
There's millions
in purse winnings, but

33:29.268 --> 33:32.053
the real money's
in stud fees.

33:32.097 --> 33:33.576
Stables can make
over a half million dollars

33:33.620 --> 33:34.751
for a champion's stud fee.

33:34.795 --> 33:36.362
And a horse

33:36.405 --> 33:37.841
can stud almost
a hundred times a year.

33:37.885 --> 33:39.974
Wow. That's a lot of money.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.803
[laughs]
Maybe even enough to kill for.

33:42.846 --> 33:44.370
Thank you, Mr. Garves.

33:44.413 --> 33:47.199
No further questions,
Your Honor.

33:49.070 --> 33:51.159
Chunk made some hay
with the jury.

33:51.203 --> 33:52.856
Yeah, but it looks
like Garrett Sinclair

33:52.900 --> 33:56.251
would like to stick
a pitchfork in his eye.

33:58.297 --> 34:00.995
Bridleright Farms has been
in my family for generations.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.997
I'm proud to uphold
its legacy

34:03.041 --> 34:05.086
of excellence
and also integrity.

34:05.130 --> 34:07.436
Which is why I have not,
nor would I ever,

34:07.480 --> 34:10.613
allow my horses to use
performance-enhancing drugs.

34:10.657 --> 34:13.094
He's laying it on
awfully thick.You think?

34:13.138 --> 34:15.575
I find it unconscionable
that the reputation

34:15.618 --> 34:19.057
of my trusted trainer
Lauren Parker is being attacked

34:19.100 --> 34:21.059
in the wake
of her tragic passing.

34:21.842 --> 34:23.626
You see that?Hmm. What?

34:23.670 --> 34:25.324
Watch Noah's body language.

34:25.367 --> 34:27.065
Here.

34:27.108 --> 34:28.849
...is being attacked
in the wake

34:28.892 --> 34:30.851
of her tragic passing.

34:30.894 --> 34:32.287
You see how it changed

34:32.331 --> 34:34.202
when Garrett started talking
about Lauren?

34:34.246 --> 34:36.204
He took his hand away.And crossed his arms.

34:36.248 --> 34:38.032
Classic indicators
of hurt and anger.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.904
Noah doesn't like Lauren.

34:40.948 --> 34:43.472
So what are you saying?

34:43.516 --> 34:45.474
We may have finally
found someone else

34:45.518 --> 34:47.650
who had a motive
to burn down that barn.

35:03.971 --> 35:04.972
Need some help, ma'am?

35:05.015 --> 35:06.713
I do. Thanks for stopping.

35:06.756 --> 35:09.019
I know a thing or two
about cars. Let me take a look.

35:09.063 --> 35:11.413
Well, actually, my car is fine,

35:11.457 --> 35:12.936
but I do need your help
with something else.

35:12.980 --> 35:14.808
What? Who-who are you?

35:14.851 --> 35:16.418
My name is Danny James.

35:16.462 --> 35:18.942
I work with Rafael Ramirez's
defense team.

35:18.986 --> 35:20.857
I figured you'd be more open
to talking to me out here

35:20.901 --> 35:22.250
than up at the ranch.

35:22.294 --> 35:23.686
Look, lady, I don't want
to get involved.

35:23.730 --> 35:25.079
I just want
to ask you a question

35:25.123 --> 35:26.298
about your boss's husband
Noah Sinclair.

35:26.341 --> 35:27.951
Do you have any reason

35:27.995 --> 35:30.476
to believe
that he disliked Lauren Parker?

35:30.519 --> 35:33.435
I'm not talking to you about
the Sinclairs. I need my job.

35:33.479 --> 35:34.871
Well, the word is already out

35:34.915 --> 35:36.525
that your bosses were
doping their horses.

35:36.569 --> 35:37.613
I mean, how much longer
do you think they'll be able

35:37.657 --> 35:39.572
to stay
in the horse racing business?

35:39.615 --> 35:42.444
No idea, but I'm holding on
to my job as long as I can.

35:44.620 --> 35:46.579
I know you like
to help people.

35:46.622 --> 35:48.668
You wouldn't have stopped
for me if you didn't.

35:48.711 --> 35:50.409
I just wonder how
it's gonna sit with you

35:50.452 --> 35:52.193
if Rafael goes to prison
for something he didn't do

35:52.237 --> 35:54.326
when you could have
helped save him.

35:56.241 --> 35:58.417
Remember how the Sinclairs filed

35:58.460 --> 36:00.332
an insurance claim on that
other horse earlier this year?

36:00.375 --> 36:03.509
Gold Rush?Yeah, Noah Sinclair's horse.

36:03.552 --> 36:07.600
Well, it turns out, Noah blamed
Lauren Parker for its death.

36:07.643 --> 36:10.733
A stable hand overheard Noah
and Garrett fighting about it.

36:10.777 --> 36:13.388
Noah was screaming
that Garrett had to fire Lauren.

36:13.432 --> 36:16.174
Hmm. Do we know
what killed the horse?

36:16.217 --> 36:17.392
TAYLOR:
The insurance claim lists

36:17.436 --> 36:19.394
cause of death
as renal failure.

36:19.438 --> 36:21.179
Performance-enhancing
drugs can wreak

36:21.222 --> 36:23.181
havoc on kidneys.

36:23.224 --> 36:25.226
If Lauren was doping the horse
without Noah's knowledge,

36:25.270 --> 36:28.229
and it wound up dead,
maybe Noah wanted revenge.

36:28.273 --> 36:30.579
You think he killed a woman
to avenge a horse?

36:30.623 --> 36:33.191
Well, Raf said Noah was
crazy about that horse.

36:33.234 --> 36:35.280
Some people love
their pets even more

36:35.323 --> 36:36.716
than they love
their families.

36:36.759 --> 36:38.108
Think about Judge Grant.True.

36:38.152 --> 36:39.980
But why kill
Bold Spirit, too?

36:40.023 --> 36:41.634
MARISSA:
An eye for an eye.

36:41.677 --> 36:43.201
He wanted
to punish Garrett

36:43.244 --> 36:45.464
for allowing Lauren
to dope his horse.

36:45.507 --> 36:47.727
But why would he let
Bold Spirit burn alive?

36:47.770 --> 36:50.643
That's a brutal way to die.Maybe he didn't.

36:50.686 --> 36:52.775
Check this out.

36:53.994 --> 36:55.604
And what is this?

36:55.648 --> 36:58.085
A prescription monitoring
database.

36:58.128 --> 37:00.174
Noah's a retired
veterinarian.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.350
A month ago, he ordered a case
of sodium pentothal,

37:02.394 --> 37:04.657
which is used
to euthanize horses.

37:04.700 --> 37:07.834
He put the horse down
before the fire?

37:07.877 --> 37:09.879
We think so.

37:09.923 --> 37:11.838
CHUNK:Or maybe he bought that
to use in case he needed

37:11.881 --> 37:14.449
to put a horse
out of his misery.

37:14.493 --> 37:16.190
Look, there's no way
we can prove

37:16.234 --> 37:18.279
that he used it
on Bold Spirit now anyway.

37:18.323 --> 37:21.413
There is, actually, if you don't
mind getting your hands dirty.

37:21.456 --> 37:23.284
I don't understand.
What is this?

37:23.328 --> 37:25.373
It's a motion
to exhume Bold Spirit.

37:26.418 --> 37:28.594
Dig him up?
Are you kidding me?

37:28.637 --> 37:30.204
They can't do this, can they?

37:30.248 --> 37:33.860
I'm afraid so.
Judge Grant signed the motion.

37:33.903 --> 37:36.254
Bold Spirit died a horrible
death because of your client,

37:36.297 --> 37:37.820
and now you won't even
let him rest in peace.

37:37.864 --> 37:39.387
We have reason to believe

37:39.431 --> 37:40.606
that Bold Spirit didn't die
in the fire.

37:40.649 --> 37:42.303
What are you talking about?

37:42.347 --> 37:43.870
His body was found
along with Lauren's.

37:43.913 --> 37:47.003
We believe that he was
euthanized with sodium pentothal

37:47.047 --> 37:48.396
before the fire
was started.

37:48.440 --> 37:51.269
Sodium pentothal
is a controlled substance.

37:51.312 --> 37:52.835
How would Rafael get
his hands on it?

37:52.879 --> 37:53.967
He didn't.

37:54.010 --> 37:55.664
But your husband did.

37:55.708 --> 37:58.580
[laughing]

37:58.624 --> 38:00.713
This is insane.GARRETT:
First you tried

38:00.756 --> 38:02.280
to pin this on me.

38:02.323 --> 38:04.020
Then you go
after Lauren's reputation.

38:04.064 --> 38:05.195
Now you're accusing Noah.

38:05.239 --> 38:06.806
You're just grasping at straws.

38:06.849 --> 38:08.895
MARISSA:
Your husband held Lauren Parker

38:08.938 --> 38:11.289
responsible for
Gold Rush's death.

38:11.332 --> 38:13.726
He asked you to fire her,
but you didn't.

38:13.769 --> 38:15.380
You know your husband.

38:15.423 --> 38:17.512
Do you think
he'd just accept that?

38:30.177 --> 38:32.614
You asked Lauren
to stay in the barn

38:32.658 --> 38:34.660
with Bold Spirit that night.

38:34.703 --> 38:37.358
Garrett, this is insane.

38:37.402 --> 38:40.361
You know I wouldn't
have hurt anyone.

38:40.405 --> 38:43.277
Did Bold Spirit even have colic?

38:48.804 --> 38:51.067
Go ahead. Dig.

38:53.722 --> 38:56.334
[engine starts]

39:09.608 --> 39:12.959
Got it. Good news. Thanks.

I should get a discount
on my bill,
