09:49.291 --> 09:51.250
THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE,
DR. KING.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.875
(elevator bell dings)

09:52.917 --> 09:54.709
YOU'RE WELCOME,
DR. FREEDMAN.

09:56.750 --> 09:58.709
HEY. I WAS JUST COMING--

09:58.750 --> 10:01.041
SO ON MNEMBA ISLAND,
THERE'S NO PHONES,

10:01.083 --> 10:03.542
THERE'S NO COMPUTER,
THERE'S NO TELEVISION.

10:03.583 --> 10:05.917
OUR BONUS CHECKS WILL BE PUT
TO VERY GOOD USE.

10:05.959 --> 10:07.917
UM, I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

10:07.959 --> 10:09.917
WE CAN TOUCH MONKEYS, COOPER.
WE CAN TOUCH MONKEYS.

10:09.959 --> 10:11.875
YEAH, OKAY. YOU MADE THAT
LAST PART UP. I HAVE PATIENTS.

10:11.917 --> 10:14.875
WELL, I HAVE PATIENTS, TOO,
AND AS I AM SEEING THEM,

10:14.917 --> 10:18.250
PART OF ME WILL BE CONJURING
IMAGES OF TOUCHABLE MONKEYS.

10:18.291 --> 10:20.667
DEAN.

10:20.709 --> 10:22.041
HEY, DR. FREEDMAN.

10:22.083 --> 10:23.709
HOW YOU BEEN?
GOOD.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.959
HOW ABOUT YOU?
HOW YOU BEEN?
IT WAS A GOOD MONTH.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR.

10:30.083 --> 10:32.709
DELL, THE NEW PATIENT
GOWNS BLOW. THEY KEEP RIPPING.

10:32.750 --> 10:35.041
YEAH, WE'RE WORKING OUT
THE KINKS WITH SOME NEW VENDORS.
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE OLD VENDORS?

10:35.083 --> 10:37.917
AND WHERE ARE THE--
DISHWASHER.

10:37.959 --> 10:39.750
(Cooper) YEAH,
EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD.

10:39.792 --> 10:41.125
EVERYTHING AT SCHOOL GOOD?

10:41.166 --> 10:44.041
GOOD. I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.
AMY. SHE'S AMAZING.

10:44.083 --> 10:46.041
WELL, GOOD.
YOU TAKING IT SLOW?

10:46.083 --> 10:49.709
WE HAVEN'T DONE IT... YET,
BUT SHE'S GOING ON THE PILL,

10:49.750 --> 10:52.667
SO WE WILL SOON.
BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY

10:52.709 --> 10:54.875
I WILL NOT BE
THE FIRST OF MY FRIENDS.

10:54.917 --> 10:57.208
OH, I KNOW, BUT, UM,
CONDOMS, OKAY?
(sighs)

10:57.250 --> 10:59.208
HEY, S.T.D.s DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE PILL.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.625
CONDOMS ARE YOUR FRIEND--
LOTS OF CONDOMS.

11:01.667 --> 11:03.625
OR BETTER YET, YOU KNOW,
WAIT.

11:03.667 --> 11:06.917
IF THIS IS THE GIRL, YOU OUGHT
TO ENJOY THE TIME BEFORE,

11:06.959 --> 11:08.917
BECAUSE ONCE YOU'RE ON
THE OTHER SIDE,

11:08.959 --> 11:10.792
YOU CAN'T GO BACK.
HELLO.

11:10.834 --> 11:13.041
YOU JUST HEARD "BLAH, BLAH,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH"?

11:13.083 --> 11:15.041
DR. FREEDMAN,
I'M GONNA HAVE SEX,

11:15.083 --> 11:17.000
AND I REALLY LIKE HER.

11:17.041 --> 11:19.000
IT'S NOT ALL SKANKY.
IT'S RIGHT.

11:19.041 --> 11:22.083
I, LIKE, LOVE HER
AND EVERYTHING.

11:22.125 --> 11:23.709
(mouths word)

11:23.750 --> 11:26.709
WELL... NOW I GO BACK
TO MY CONDOM SPEECH.

11:26.750 --> 11:29.041
SO I AM YOUR FRIENDLY

11:29.083 --> 11:31.875
NEIGHBORHOOD
CONDOM PUSHER MAN.

11:31.917 --> 11:34.875
CONDOMS.

11:34.917 --> 11:37.834
IF YOU CAN SAVE THEIR SON BY
DELIVERING THE BABY, I DON'T--

11:37.875 --> 11:40.834
6-MONTH PREEMIES ARE AT RISK
FOR BRAIN BLEEDS, BLINDNESS,

11:40.875 --> 11:42.875
HEARING LOSS, NOT TO MENTION
RESPIRATORY DISTRESS.

11:42.917 --> 11:45.250
AND NO ONE WOULD ADVOCATE
BRINGING A CHILD

11:45.291 --> 11:47.875
INTO THE WORLD BEFORE
SHE'S READY, AND YOU KNOW IT.

11:47.917 --> 11:50.542
DID YOU EVEN CONSIDER THE FACT
THAT THIS LITTLE GIRL

11:50.583 --> 11:52.625
IS ARRIVING INTO A FAMILY
UNWANTED?

11:52.667 --> 11:54.875
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SHE DISCOVERS
THAT THE ONLY REASON

11:54.917 --> 11:57.250
SHE WAS CONCEIVED
WAS TO SAVE HER BROTHER'S LIFE?
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

11:57.291 --> 12:00.041
SAVING THIS FAMILY FROM
SUFFERING THE DEATH OF A CHILD.

12:00.083 --> 12:03.709
YOU GAVE THEM HOPE
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE. I--
I'M TRYING TO SAVE
A CHILD'S LIFE.

12:03.750 --> 12:05.583
YOU DISCUSS THIS STUFF
WITH US.

12:05.625 --> 12:08.208
WHEN ANY OF US COME INTO
AN ETHICAL GRAY AREA,

12:08.250 --> 12:10.208
WE ALL DISCUSS IT.

12:10.250 --> 12:12.208
WE DECIDE AS A PRACTICE
WHAT TO DO.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.917
I MEANT TO, ALL RIGHT?
I... I JUST FORGOT.

12:14.959 --> 12:18.208
SINCE WHEN DO YOU
FORGET ANYTHING?

12:18.250 --> 12:20.208
IF I COULD GET ONE GUY

12:20.250 --> 12:22.500
TO DO A COLONOSCOPY
WITH NO COMPLAINT...

12:22.542 --> 12:25.500
I MEAN, LIKE I'M HAPPY ABOUT
GOING ALL UP IN THERE.

12:25.542 --> 12:27.041
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

12:27.083 --> 12:29.041
I'M TRYING
TO LEAVE YOU A NOTE,

12:29.083 --> 12:31.500
BUT I CAN'T FIND A PEN
THAT WORKS.
WELL, WHAT'S--WHAT'S THE NOTE?

12:31.542 --> 12:34.041
HOW I CAN'T FIND A PEN
THAT WORKS.

12:34.083 --> 12:36.041
DELL HAS DECIDED TO GO GREEN--
TISSUE PAPER GOWNS,

12:36.083 --> 12:38.083
NO CUPS, NO PENS.

12:38.125 --> 12:41.625
I'M ALL ABOUT SAVING THE PLANET,
BUT HE'S KILLING ME.
YOU WANT ME TO TALK TO DELL?

12:41.667 --> 12:43.625
WE BOTH KNOW
WHO DELL LISTENS TO.

12:43.667 --> 12:44.959
IS THIS NAOMI'S IDEA?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.750
I HAVE NO CLUE
WHAT NAOMI'S IDEAS ARE.

12:47.792 --> 12:51.041
MY WOMAN'S GIVING ME TROUBLE.
YOUR WOMAN'S GIVING YOU TROUBLE.

12:51.083 --> 12:53.041
THESE WOMEN, COOPER.

12:53.083 --> 12:55.125
WHAT?

12:55.166 --> 12:58.542
14-YEAR-OLD KID, I'VE BEEN
TREATING HIM SINCE HE WAS 5.

12:58.583 --> 13:01.041
NOW HE'S FOUND THIS GIRL--
HE LIKES HER,

13:01.083 --> 13:03.041
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE SEX.
THAT'S HARDLY A SHOCKER.

13:03.083 --> 13:06.041
WAIT, DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE GETTING ALL NOSTALGIC.
IT'S DEAN MILLER.

13:06.083 --> 13:08.542
OH, MAN.
WHY DOES
THAT NAME SOUND FAMILIAR?

13:08.583 --> 13:11.000
BECAUSE WE DEBATED WHETHER
WE SHOULD TAKE HIM ON

13:11.041 --> 13:13.583
AS A PATIENT.
HE'S THE KID WHO--

13:13.625 --> 13:16.125
HE'S H.I.V. POSITIVE,
BUT THAT WASN'T THE DEBATE.
THE PROBLEM IS, HE DOESN'T
KNOW HE'S H.I.V. POSITIVE.

13:16.166 --> 13:18.709
HIS PARENTS WON'T TELL HIM,

13:18.750 --> 13:21.041
AND HE DOESN'T KNOW
HE COULD KILL THAT GIRL.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.709
HE THINKS
HE HAS A KIDNEY CONDITION,

13:27.750 --> 13:30.000
AND HE'S DOING QUITE WELL.
I MEAN, THE MAJORITY

13:30.041 --> 13:32.667
OF HIS SYMPTOMS ARE FROM
THE ANTIVIRAL COCKTAIL.
HOW DO YOU
KEEP SOMETHING LIKE THAT

13:32.709 --> 13:35.000
FROM YOUR KID FOR 14 YEARS?
IT WAS BEFORE
THE PROGNOSIS CHANGED.

13:35.041 --> 13:36.959
THEY DIDN'T THINK
HE WAS GONNA BE ALIVE

13:37.000 --> 13:39.583
LONG ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND.
SO THAT EXPLAINS
THE FIRST SIX YEARS.

13:39.625 --> 13:41.583
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO TELL HIM
ABOUT THE H.I.V.

13:41.625 --> 13:43.625
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO TELL THE PARENTS

13:43.667 --> 13:45.083
ANYTHING THAT DEAN TELLS ME.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.583
DOCTOR-PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY
ALL AROUND.
SO YOU CAN'T

13:46.625 --> 13:49.291
LET 'EM KNOW
ABOUT THE GIRLFRIEND.
NO, OR THAT
THEY'RE GONNA DO IT.

13:49.333 --> 13:52.208
THIS IS A GOOD KID.
HE WOULD NOT ENDANGER THIS GIRL

13:52.250 --> 13:54.208
IF HE KNEW, AND HE DOESN'T.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.917
HIS HORMONES ARE FULL ROAR,
RIGHT? HE LIKES THE GIRL.

13:56.959 --> 13:59.083
HE WANTS THE GIRL.
HE'S GOTTA HAVE THE GIRL.
(Sam) WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE.

13:59.125 --> 14:01.041
YES, WE HAVE.

14:01.083 --> 14:02.542
ANYWAY...

14:02.583 --> 14:04.041
YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:04.083 --> 14:07.000
I GOTTA TRY TO GET
HIS PARENTS BACK IN MY OFFICE.

14:09.083 --> 14:10.917
(Molly) HE LOVES BUGS.

14:10.959 --> 14:14.959
AND HE SNEAKS LADYBUGS
INTO THE HOUSE IN HIS POCKET.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.792
HE LIKES MEATBALLS...
(chuckles) AND FRENCH FRIES.

14:17.834 --> 14:20.625
(sniffles) AND HE'S STILL
AFRAID OF THE DARK,

14:20.667 --> 14:23.041
BUT HE THINKS
HE'S TOO OLD TO ADMIT IT,

14:23.083 --> 14:24.667
SO I HAVE TO PRETEND

14:24.709 --> 14:26.875
TO FORGET TO TURN OFF
THE LIGHT AT BEDTIME.

14:26.917 --> 14:29.875
AND HE LIKES TO READ. AND ALL
HE WANTS FOR HIS 8th BIRTHDAY

14:29.917 --> 14:32.542
IS TO NEVER GO
TO A HOSPITAL AGAIN.

14:32.583 --> 14:35.041
HE--HE'S A WONDERFUL BOY.

14:35.083 --> 14:38.834
I CAN SEE THAT,
BUT, MRS. MADISON, I CAN'T.

14:38.875 --> 14:41.834
IN GOOD CONSCIENCE, I CAN'T
DELIVER YOUR BABY EARLY

14:41.875 --> 14:43.959
BECAUSE I'M SURE
SHE'S WONDERFUL, TOO.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.875
WE ARE GOOD PEOPLE AND--AND WE
DIDN'T GO INTO THIS LIGHTLY--

14:46.917 --> 14:48.875
HAVING THIS BABY--
AND WE WILL LOVE HER.

14:48.917 --> 14:51.250
WE WILL. IT'S JUST,
WE DON'T KNOW HER YET.

14:51.291 --> 14:55.041
AND... I-I KNOW JASON.

14:55.083 --> 14:57.917
I'VE HELD JASON.
I--I'VE SMELLED HIS SKIN.

14:57.959 --> 14:59.583
I-I KNOW JASON.

14:59.625 --> 15:00.959
I'M SO SORRY.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.625
I--I'VE CHECKED YOU OUT.
YOU'RE A SPECIALIST.

15:04.667 --> 15:08.083
IF--IF ANYONE CAN DELIVER
A PREMATURE BABY SAFELY,

15:08.125 --> 15:09.917
IT'S YOU.

15:13.625 --> 15:16.583
I WISH I COULD HELP,
BUT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.583
HOW CAN YOU
LOOK AT MY 7-YEAR-OLD SON

15:18.625 --> 15:23.000
AND KNOW HE'S GOING TO BE DEAD
IN A WEEK AND DO NOTHING?
(whispers) PLEASE.

15:30.583 --> 15:32.041
(elevator bell dings)
ADDISON--

15:32.083 --> 15:34.125
DON'T TALK TO ME.
ADDI--

15:34.166 --> 15:37.125
DON'T SAY ANYTHING, PLEASE.
JUST DON'T.
ADDISON, I WAS NOT TRYING
TO MANIPULATE YOU.

15:37.166 --> 15:40.041
I JUST THOUGHT IF YOU SAW HIM,
MAYBE YOU WOULD REALIZE

15:40.083 --> 15:42.041
THAT YOU CAN HELP THEM.
I CAN'T HELP THEM!

15:42.083 --> 15:44.041
YOU GAVE THEM HOPE
THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE,

15:44.083 --> 15:48.041
AND NOW I AM THE BAD GUY.
ADDISON.

15:48.083 --> 15:50.500
I TOLD YOU
NOT TO SAY ANYTHING TO ME.

15:53.250 --> 15:56.000
HEY, I REALLY DO
NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
NOT NOW, DELL.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.917
(sighs)

16:01.959 --> 16:03.917
ARE YOU OKAY?
(Sam) WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:03.959 --> 16:05.792
(Pete)
HAS THERE BEEN BLOODSHED?

16:05.834 --> 16:08.583
BECAUSE NAOMI IS IN THE KITCHEN
JUST INHALING THE CANDY SUPPLY.

16:08.625 --> 16:11.917
COME ON. IT WAS LOW
TO BEGIN WITH.
WELL, DELL REFUSES TO BUY
ANY NEW CANDY.

16:11.959 --> 16:14.041
WAIT, HE'S WITHHOLDING CANDY?
HE TOLD ME TO "MAKE DUE"

16:14.083 --> 16:17.041
WITH THE SWEET TARTS
FROM LAST HALLOWEEN?
WELL, NOBODY CAN HANDLE
THE OLD SWEET TARTS.

16:17.083 --> 16:20.083
WE NEED CHOCOLATE.
NO, I TOLD--I TOLD DELL
THAT HE HAD TO GET--

16:20.125 --> 16:22.250
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH CANDY.

16:22.291 --> 16:24.041
(sighs)

16:24.083 --> 16:26.250
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING.
I CAN'T SAVE THAT CHILD.

16:26.291 --> 16:27.875
I CAN'T DELIVER THE BABY.

16:27.917 --> 16:31.041
TO THE BEST
OF MY MEDICAL EXPERTISE...

16:31.083 --> 16:34.208
I CANNOT DO... ANYTHING.

16:34.250 --> 16:36.083
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP.

16:36.125 --> 16:38.291
IT'S NOT YOUR MESS.
IT'S NAOMI'S.
WAIT, YOU MEAN THE MADISONS?

16:38.333 --> 16:40.834
BECAUSE NAOMI DID
WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS RIGHT.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.041
YOU DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
TO SAVE YOUR FAMILY.

16:43.083 --> 16:45.542
SHE HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING
THE DONOR WOULD BACK OUT,

16:45.583 --> 16:47.917
AND NOW IT'S TOO LATE.
BUT WE ALWAYS DISCUSS
THESE THINGS AS A GROUP.

16:47.959 --> 16:50.166
NAOMI WENT AHEAD AND DID THIS
WITHOUT TALKING TO ANYBODY.

16:50.208 --> 16:52.291
SO MAYBE
SHE'S OFF HER GAME.

16:52.333 --> 16:54.917
SHE'S SEEING A RECORD NUMBER
OF PATIENTS A DAY--
SHE'S BEEN
REALLY ON EDGE LATELY.

16:54.959 --> 16:57.542
YEAH, IT'S NOT LIKE HER.
WELL, GUYS, I MEAN,

16:57.583 --> 16:58.917
SHE DOES EVERYTHING.

16:58.959 --> 17:01.000
WE JUST...
EAT THE CANDY.

17:01.041 --> 17:02.583
SHE'S HIDING SOMETHING.

17:02.625 --> 17:04.792
HAS ANYBODY EVEN ASKED HER
WHAT'S WRONG?

17:04.834 --> 17:07.166
(Cooper)
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

17:07.208 --> 17:09.500
THIS I CAN
DO SOMETHING ABOUT.

17:12.041 --> 17:14.667
WHO'D WIN IN A FISTFIGHT,
NAOMI OR ADDISON?

17:17.625 --> 17:19.875
NOT IN THE MOOD
FOR A LECTURE.

17:19.917 --> 17:22.875
OH, I'M NOT GONNA LECTURE YOU.
I'M JUST GONNA BLOCK THE EXITS

17:22.917 --> 17:26.250
UNTIL YOU DECIDE TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU.
WELL, WE'RE GONNA BE HERE
A VERY LONG TIME.

17:26.291 --> 17:28.083
I CAN WAIT.
(clears throat)

17:35.083 --> 17:37.625
(Cooper) WHAT, THEY'RE NOT
EVEN SAYING ANYTHING?

17:37.667 --> 17:39.625
THEY'RE JUST
STANDING THERE.
A TEST OF WILLS.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.208
A BATTLE OF CHAMPIONS.
UH-HUH.

17:41.250 --> 17:44.083
YOU GUYS ARE SO MATURE.
OH, YEAH? YOU MENTIONED
A FISTFIGHT.

17:44.125 --> 17:45.625
THAT'S TRUE.

17:45.667 --> 17:48.041
COOPER.

17:48.083 --> 17:49.667
DEAN'S PARENTS ARE HERE...

17:49.709 --> 17:50.875
THANKS.

17:50.917 --> 17:52.500
AND EVERYONE ELSE.

17:52.542 --> 17:54.875
THERE'S A LOBBY
FULL OF PATIENTS...
(clears throat)

17:54.917 --> 17:57.500
IN CASE ANYONE IS INTERESTED
IN WORKING HERE

17:57.542 --> 17:59.500
OR RUNNING THIS PLACE.

17:59.542 --> 18:02.500
THERE'S A GIRL DEAN LIKES,
BUT SEX IS A LONG WAY OFF.

18:02.542 --> 18:04.500
I'VE HAD PREGNANT
13 YEAR OLDS

18:04.542 --> 18:06.500
WHOSE PARENTS
HAVE SAID THE SAME THING.

18:06.542 --> 18:08.917
DEAN NEEDS TO KNOW
HIS H.I.V. STATUS

18:08.959 --> 18:11.291
BEFORE HE STARTS EXPERIMENTING.
AND HE WILL.

18:11.333 --> 18:13.291
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT.

18:13.333 --> 18:16.625
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IT'S
LIKE FOR H.I.V. KIDS?

18:16.667 --> 18:18.667
A KID IN CHICAGO GOT SHOT.

18:18.709 --> 18:21.041
ANOTHER KID, THEY TIED HIM
TO A CAR BUMPER.
THAT'S BEFORE PEOPLE
WERE EDUCATED.

18:21.083 --> 18:23.709
NOBODY NEEDS TO KNOW
BUT DEAN.
HE'S NOT OLD ENOUGH
TO DEAL WITH THIS, NOT YET.

18:23.750 --> 18:26.667
YOU WANT THEM TO BE CHILDREN
AS LONG AS IT LASTS.

18:26.709 --> 18:28.667
THINGS ARE SO SWEET,
THEY CAN STILL BE ANYTHING.

18:28.709 --> 18:30.083
AS SOON AS THAT'S OVER--

18:30.125 --> 18:32.542
I WISH IT COULD BE LONGER,
BUT IT CAN'T.

18:32.583 --> 18:34.917
YOU SAY PEOPLE ARE EDUCATED?
THEY'LL UNDERSTAND?

18:34.959 --> 18:37.625
IF IT WAS YOUR KID,
YOU WOULDN'T BE SO SURE.

18:37.667 --> 18:39.875
COULD YOU HONESTLY LIVE
WITH YOURSELVES--
DO YOU NOT HEAR ME?

18:39.917 --> 18:41.959
IF HE GETS ANOTHER KID SICK,
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN HE FINDS OUT

18:42.000 --> 18:45.166
THAT YOU DIDN'T--
WE WILL DO WHAT'S BEST FOR HIM,
AND DON'T YOU OVERSTEP HERE.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.166
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING ME
MUCH CHOICE.

18:47.208 --> 18:50.166
SAY ONE WORD TO DEAN,
AND I--I'LL TAKE YOUR LICENSE.

18:50.208 --> 18:53.542
I WILL SUE YOU
FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT.

18:59.625 --> 19:02.125
NAI... COME ON.
YOU CAN TELL ME ANYTHING.

19:02.166 --> 19:04.750
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU TO GET
THE MADISONS PREGNANT

19:04.792 --> 19:07.125
WITHOUT DISCUSSING IT
WITH THE REST OF US.

19:07.166 --> 19:09.875
NOW I KNOW YOU MUST HAVE
HAD A GOOD REASON.

19:09.917 --> 19:13.166
YOU HAVE A GOOD HEART.
JUST TALK TO ME.

19:15.083 --> 19:17.041
THEY PAID THE PRACTICE
$80,000.

19:17.083 --> 19:20.125
AND I DON'T HAVE
A GOOD HEART.

19:20.166 --> 19:22.750
THEY HAD CASH,
AND WE NEEDED THE MONEY,

19:22.792 --> 19:24.625
AND SO I TOOK IT

19:24.667 --> 19:26.625
EVEN THOUGH
I DID HAVE RESERVATIONS,

19:26.667 --> 19:29.750
BECAUSE NAOMI ALWAYS KEEPS
THE TRAINS RUNNING ON TIME.

19:29.792 --> 19:32.542
WHAT, UH, WHAT DO YOU--
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT--

19:32.583 --> 19:35.291
I KEEP THE TRAINS RUNNING
ON TIME. THAT'S WHAT I DO.

19:35.333 --> 19:37.291
I RUN THINGS.
I MIND THE DETAILS.

19:37.333 --> 19:40.709
ONLY THIS TIME, IT...
JUST GOT AWAY FROM ME.

19:40.750 --> 19:43.041
WHAT GOT AWAY FROM YOU?

19:43.083 --> 19:45.583
(lowered voice)
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYBODY.

19:45.625 --> 19:48.583
YOU CANNOT TELL THE OTHERS.
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE.
WHAT, UM, OKAY, I PROMISE.

19:48.625 --> 19:51.083
WHAT, ARE YOU--YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE PRACTICE?

19:51.125 --> 19:53.125
(normal voice)
WE OWN THE BUILDING.

19:53.166 --> 19:55.667
AND--AND I SAW A CHANCE
TO REFINANCE THE MORTGAGE,

19:55.709 --> 19:57.250
AND I THOUGHT...

19:57.291 --> 20:00.041
NOW THE BALLOON PAYMENT
IS DUE,

20:00.083 --> 20:03.625
AND NO ONE IS BILLING ENOUGH,
AND THERE ISN'T ENOUGH.

20:03.667 --> 20:06.041
THERE IS NEVER ENOUGH.
(sighs)

20:06.083 --> 20:09.041
AND SO I USED THE LAST OF
THE MONEY TO MAKE THE VIDEO.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.250
NAOMI--
WE ARE BROKE, ADDISON.

20:11.291 --> 20:14.208
IF THINGS KEEP GOING
THE WAY THEY HAVE BEEN,

20:14.250 --> 20:17.625
THE PRACTICE IS FINISHED...
SOON.

20:21.792 --> 20:23.041
ALL RIGHT, SCREW THEM.

20:23.083 --> 20:25.083
WE LET THEM COME AFTER ME.
THEY REALLY THINK

20:25.125 --> 20:27.583
A JURY'S GONNA BACK THEM
WHEN THEY'RE PERFECTLY HAPPY

20:27.625 --> 20:30.875
TO LET THEIR SON INFECT
SOME NICE GIRL FROM THE 'BURBS?
THE LAW SAYS THEY HAVE
THE RIGHT TO DO THIS

20:30.917 --> 20:33.083
HOW THEY WANT TO DO THIS.
I'M TAKING MY CHANCES.
I'M GONNA TELL DEAN.

20:33.125 --> 20:35.250
IF THEY SUE,
THEY SUE THE PRACTICE.

20:35.291 --> 20:38.208
WHY DON'T YOU THINK ABOUT
SOMEONE OTHER THAN YOURSELF?

20:38.250 --> 20:41.208
WHOA, NAOMI. COOP'S JUST TRYING
TO DO THE RIGHT THING, HERE.
HE'S TALKING ABOUT
GETTING US SUED.

20:41.250 --> 20:43.083
THERE ARE
RESPONSIBILITIES HERE.

HAS THE RIGHT

20:45.125 --> 20:47.250
TO HIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION
FROM EACH OTHER?

20:47.291 --> 20:50.709

FOR GOOD REASON.
HIDING THINGS
