00:06.945 --> 00:08.653
Previously on "The Purge"...

00:08.654 --> 00:11.156
Who's Drew Adams, and why is
she on your personal computer?

00:11.157 --> 00:12.959
- Freeze!
- Who the hell are they?

00:12.960 --> 00:15.070
Jackals, thieves who
steal from other thieves

00:15.078 --> 00:17.412
- on Purge Night.
- I need your help.

00:17.413 --> 00:19.919
So you think you can take down the NFFA.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.899
They're killing innocent
people off-Purge,

00:21.900 --> 00:23.252
and I think I found the proof.

00:23.253 --> 00:25.379
If you're that good, you can
help me find someone else.

00:25.380 --> 00:27.294
We worked side-by-side with Esme,

00:27.295 --> 00:29.341
but she has committed an act of treason.

00:29.342 --> 00:32.637
Your husband took out a
Purge contract on Marcus.

00:32.650 --> 00:36.089
Okay, fine! I did it! Please, just stop!

00:36.090 --> 00:37.391
You only took 10k down.

00:37.392 --> 00:38.977
I told you to get rid of
the rest of the contract.

00:38.978 --> 00:40.639
I wasn't the only one.

00:40.640 --> 00:41.760
They all did it.

00:42.760 --> 00:45.774
So the Campus Killer is going viral, yo.

00:45.775 --> 00:46.809
Be careful.

00:46.810 --> 00:48.719
When we bottle up our feelings,

00:48.720 --> 00:52.269
they can come out in other
ways that might be scary.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

01:04.080 --> 01:05.949
Very cute, Ian.

01:05.950 --> 01:07.505
The visibility is excellent,

01:07.506 --> 01:11.389
ventilation is greatly improved
from last year's model.

01:11.390 --> 01:13.359
Big step up.

01:13.360 --> 01:14.511
It better be.

01:14.512 --> 01:16.359
We don't need another
suffocation lawsuit.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.839
Thank God that happened on Purge.

01:17.840 --> 01:21.059
I think we should make a
push into the LGBTQ market.

01:21.060 --> 01:24.319
We'll look like we care,
earn a bunch of goodwill,

01:24.320 --> 01:25.349
make a tidy profit.

01:25.350 --> 01:26.979
Well, we do need more lifestyle reach.

01:26.980 --> 01:29.259
And focus groups reacted positively

01:29.260 --> 01:30.939
to the idea of a pride-themed mask.

01:30.940 --> 01:36.242
So we changed a few colors
on an old S.K.U. and voilÃ !

01:37.380 --> 01:38.780
I'd run with that.

01:38.786 --> 01:40.163
It shows we listen to our customers.

01:40.164 --> 01:42.719
Um, we should at least donate
a portion of the proceeds

01:42.720 --> 01:44.373
- to a relevant charity.
- Fine. Done.

01:44.374 --> 01:47.799
Jimmy, where are we at with the
inspired-by-true-events space?

01:47.800 --> 01:48.999
All the usuals...

01:49.000 --> 01:52.007
presidents, pop stars,
a lot of Hitler variations,

01:52.008 --> 01:54.419
but I would like to put
one more into production.

01:54.420 --> 01:55.739
Well, that'd be a hell of a rush job.

01:55.740 --> 01:58.306
It'll be worth it. Trust me.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.300
It's blowing up.

02:01.309 --> 02:02.679
The Campus Killer?

02:02.680 --> 02:05.779
We make Purge masks, not murder masks.

02:05.780 --> 02:07.909
We'd be promoting
an active serial killer.

02:07.910 --> 02:08.919
Yeah, you might be right.

02:08.919 --> 02:10.651
But our advertising
allowance has been slashed.

02:10.651 --> 02:11.789
With something like this,

02:11.790 --> 02:13.539
cable news does all the heavy lifting.

02:13.540 --> 02:17.359
I'm with Jimmy on this.
I mean, bad taste sells.

02:17.360 --> 02:19.559
Look how simple it is.

02:19.560 --> 02:21.299
Our margins will be huge.

02:21.300 --> 02:22.439
I'll call production.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.599
Let's get a run of these going ASAP.

02:24.600 --> 02:27.459
Hey, good work, kid.
We're gonna make a killing.

02:42.750 --> 02:46.145
_

02:48.200 --> 02:50.989
You sure we have to do this tonight?

02:50.990 --> 02:53.219
It's a skeleton crew at this hour,

02:53.220 --> 02:54.859
it'll buy us more time.

02:54.860 --> 02:57.869
The NFFA has half the
city looking for you.

02:57.870 --> 03:00.239
You're probably locked out
of their system by now.

03:00.240 --> 03:02.120
No, they wouldn't lock me out.

03:03.070 --> 03:04.538
Why not?

03:04.539 --> 03:07.457
If I log in, they'll be
able to trace my location.

03:07.458 --> 03:08.909
So it's a trap.

03:08.910 --> 03:11.119
Only if they catch us.

03:11.120 --> 03:14.619
I've rerouted my signal
through a few hubs, but still.

03:14.620 --> 03:16.755
Once I'm logged in,
we'll have to move fast.

03:16.756 --> 03:19.928
Yeah, you took a big risk
coming to a former cop.

03:19.929 --> 03:22.889
What made you think I
wasn't gonna turn you in?

03:22.890 --> 03:25.789
You walked away from a
system that betrayed you.

03:25.790 --> 03:27.519
Seemed like someone
who would understand.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.889
Besides...

03:29.890 --> 03:31.849
I saw you on Purge Night.

03:31.850 --> 03:34.079
- You did?
- Yeah.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.039
You refused to kill
those security guards

03:36.040 --> 03:37.864
when anyone else would've purged them.

03:37.865 --> 03:40.359
Don't canonize me just yet.

03:40.360 --> 03:41.780
You about ready?

03:42.910 --> 03:43.910
Ready.

03:43.911 --> 03:44.939
Go.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.001
I'm in.

03:57.090 --> 03:58.464
Where are we at, Vivian?

03:58.465 --> 04:00.177
Triangulating her position.

04:00.178 --> 04:02.929
She stays on another few
seconds then we'll have her.

04:17.060 --> 04:20.113
- Time?
- We're out of it.

04:20.113 --> 04:21.678
Shit.

04:26.412 --> 04:27.454
I'm almost there.

04:27.455 --> 04:28.873
We gotta be wheels up.

04:31.960 --> 04:34.279
- Done.
- Let's go.

04:43.930 --> 04:45.459
652 Longview.

04:45.460 --> 04:46.469
Alert dispatch.

04:46.470 --> 04:48.509
Tell them to send everything they got.

04:55.180 --> 04:56.439
Did you get them?

04:56.440 --> 04:58.599
Full names, addresses.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.030
Everything you need to
track these guys down.

05:08.950 --> 05:11.199
Meet your Jackals.

05:20.300 --> 05:23.499
Listen, um, I'm gonna make some coffee.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.949
And just act like is this
a normal morning, huh?

05:26.950 --> 05:28.819
I don't know. We'll eat breakfast.

05:28.820 --> 05:30.699
We'll figure this out.

05:30.700 --> 05:32.429
I'll call the PI.

05:32.430 --> 05:36.619
No, we can't tell the
PI about last night.

05:38.442 --> 05:42.195
Yeah, right.

05:44.130 --> 05:46.069
I can't believe we did that.

05:50.710 --> 05:52.519
Well, at least we got results.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.375
We know more than we did all year.

05:54.376 --> 05:56.119
But?

05:56.120 --> 05:58.979
I mean, but somebody tried to Purge me,

05:58.980 --> 06:01.149
and now I feel like the bad guy.

06:01.150 --> 06:02.592
I know the feeling.

06:05.560 --> 06:08.519
Babe, it can get uglier.

06:08.520 --> 06:11.099
Are you sure you wanna be here?

06:11.100 --> 06:14.061
I am not leaving you.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.069
Not after...

06:17.070 --> 06:20.320
not after the part I played in all this.

06:24.440 --> 06:26.799
Listen, if these people
here at this neighborhood

06:26.800 --> 06:30.709
really wants to Purge you,
they're the crazy ones, okay?

06:30.710 --> 06:33.019
- Mm-hmm.
- Not us.

06:33.020 --> 06:35.290
Yeah.

06:49.340 --> 06:53.029
Oh, you can't go.

06:53.030 --> 06:56.269
Well, is Ben up? Can't he drive you?

06:56.270 --> 06:57.889
No, I'm calling a car.

06:57.890 --> 07:01.400
That's an awfully long way.
Won't that cost a fortune?

07:02.800 --> 07:04.109
Kelen...

07:04.110 --> 07:08.219
sweetie, did you and Ben get in a fight?

07:08.220 --> 07:10.649
No. It's fine.

07:10.650 --> 07:11.993
I just have to go.

07:11.994 --> 07:14.788
Well, at least let me
make you breakfast.

07:51.260 --> 07:53.820
- Morning, guys.
- Morning.

07:53.828 --> 07:55.370
Morning.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.209
How'd you sleep?

08:01.210 --> 08:04.329
I slept great. Really great.

08:04.330 --> 08:07.879
Huh, must have. You're
never up before me.

08:07.880 --> 08:12.470
I was just telling your mom
I've got a ton of work to do.

08:12.471 --> 08:15.473
Big poli-sci project coming up.

08:15.474 --> 08:16.859
I'm gonna grab a car back to campus

08:16.860 --> 08:18.470
and get an early start on it.

08:18.477 --> 08:20.604
Thanks for everything, Ms. Gardner.

08:22.220 --> 08:23.690
I'll see you later, okay?

08:23.691 --> 08:25.119
No, wait, I'll... I'll take you.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.359
Um...

08:26.360 --> 08:29.219
no, you should spend some
time with your family.

08:29.220 --> 08:30.656
I don't wanna cut your trip short.

08:30.657 --> 08:31.779
It's no problem.

08:31.780 --> 08:33.619
- Right, Mom?
- Of course not.

08:33.620 --> 08:35.077
I'd feel better if you drove her.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
See?

08:37.001 --> 08:39.580
Let me just gonna grab
my bags and get dressed.

08:41.039 --> 08:42.979
All righty.

09:05.733 --> 09:08.276
The hell are they doing?

09:10.880 --> 09:13.309
Are you sure you saw them go in?

09:13.310 --> 09:15.879
I'm sure.

09:22.880 --> 09:24.889
Come on.

09:24.890 --> 09:27.019
Where are you going?

09:27.020 --> 09:28.463
Around back.

09:44.063 --> 09:46.229
Oh, boy.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.361
What are you guys doing here?

09:50.362 --> 09:52.195
I want to talk.

09:52.196 --> 09:54.249
Marcus, I, uh, I don't
know what this is about,

09:54.250 --> 09:55.449
but you look upset.

09:55.450 --> 09:57.243
- Why don't we, uh...
- Enough, okay?

09:57.244 --> 09:59.919
Just stop. No more bullshit.

10:01.700 --> 10:04.958
What have I done to all of you
to make you hate me so much?

10:08.330 --> 10:10.339
Please, just talk to us.

10:11.340 --> 10:14.619
Whatever I've done, okay?

10:14.620 --> 10:16.589
I don't deserve to die.

10:20.860 --> 10:22.726
Imagine if it was your family.

10:27.740 --> 10:29.449
Just, please.

10:29.450 --> 10:32.318
Just give us a chance.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.129
What a speech.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.459
Were you finished?

10:59.800 --> 11:01.720
Recognize me?

11:04.220 --> 11:06.395
I'm your neighbor, Clint, and...

11:08.060 --> 11:10.106
you killed my wife.

11:14.960 --> 11:18.089
You can't make amends, Marcus.

11:18.090 --> 11:20.049
Five years ago, I came home from work,

11:20.050 --> 11:22.786
and Maisy, she was having
trouble breathing.

11:22.787 --> 11:25.319
Brought her to the ER at Bienville,

11:25.320 --> 11:27.874
you examined her.

11:27.875 --> 11:30.293
Nurses said you diagnosed, uh,

11:30.294 --> 11:32.789
atrial fibrillation.

11:32.790 --> 11:34.919
You came out, you explained
that you were gonna have

11:34.920 --> 11:39.219
to shock her heart back into rhythm.

11:39.220 --> 11:40.929
How routine it was,

11:40.930 --> 11:43.719
that I had nothing to worry about.

11:43.720 --> 11:45.999
I believed you.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.354
You seemed so fucking
smart and confident.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.140
There was a problem.

11:52.140 --> 11:54.459
As soon as you shocked her heart,

11:54.460 --> 11:56.194
it never started pumping again.

11:56.195 --> 11:59.699
You didn't even come out to tell me.

11:59.700 --> 12:02.039
After all that shit about how
I had nothing to worry about,

12:02.040 --> 12:04.536
you send another doctor
out to break the news.

12:07.920 --> 12:10.041
Uh, um, Clint?

12:10.042 --> 12:14.749
Uh, uh, look, yeah, I don't...
I don't know what to say.

12:14.750 --> 12:15.999
Okay?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.179
I... I do my best,

12:18.180 --> 12:20.760
and then just... yeah, every time.

12:20.761 --> 12:23.555
But sometimes, there isn't
anything that I can do.

12:24.920 --> 12:27.050
I'm sorry.

12:27.059 --> 12:28.685
Don't pretend like you cared, man.

12:28.686 --> 12:30.529
I do care.

12:35.020 --> 12:38.160
When you moved into the neighborhood,

12:38.170 --> 12:40.948
I thought for sure you'd
come see how I was doing.

12:40.949 --> 12:43.399
You didn't recognize me.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.077
Treated me like a stranger.

12:45.078 --> 12:47.949
She was a pillar of this community.

12:47.950 --> 12:49.859
We all loved her.

12:49.860 --> 12:51.289
She was a saint.

12:51.290 --> 12:54.085
And the truth is

12:54.086 --> 12:56.713
you barely know any of us.

12:56.714 --> 13:00.633
So wait a minute, so you...
you agree with this guy?

13:00.634 --> 13:04.260
I speak for the group, Marcus...

13:05.880 --> 13:08.349
But I'm a fair man.

13:08.350 --> 13:10.601
I'll make you a deal.

13:10.602 --> 13:15.140
You get out of here
tonight by midnight...

13:16.530 --> 13:20.669
and we'll consider taking
the hit off your head.

13:20.670 --> 13:22.947
But if you don't,

13:22.948 --> 13:27.618
I'm the one that's going to
kill you this Purge Night.

13:31.010 --> 13:33.417
You're planning revenge on the Jackals?

13:34.380 --> 13:35.659
Not exactly.

13:35.660 --> 13:38.979
See that box on the floor?

13:38.980 --> 13:41.670
Open that up.

13:44.261 --> 13:46.299
- What's this?
- Put it on.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.879
It's time to change your look.

13:48.880 --> 13:51.519
And when we get there, I've
got to talk to Doug and Sara.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.099
They're a little spooked
at how much heat

13:53.100 --> 13:55.029
you have on you right now.

13:55.030 --> 13:57.199
Your team, your rules.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.901
And I have a passport guy.

14:00.660 --> 14:02.779
Thank you, but I'm not going anywhere.

14:04.490 --> 14:06.499
Graveyards are full of heroes.

14:06.500 --> 14:09.118
- Good thing I'm not a hero.
- Yeah?

14:09.119 --> 14:11.747
Oh, Jesus, how... how long ago?

14:13.620 --> 14:15.359
I understand. Thank you.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.819
- What's going on?
- I got to handle something.

14:17.820 --> 14:19.709
Now?

14:19.710 --> 14:21.659
That was my mother's nursing home.

14:21.660 --> 14:24.217
She wandered off the grounds.
No one can seem to find her.

14:24.218 --> 14:25.426
Is she sick?

14:25.427 --> 14:26.559
She has Alzheimer's.

14:26.560 --> 14:29.639
Last time she got out,
she got clipped by a car.

14:29.640 --> 14:32.225
Oh, my God. Where do you think she went?

14:32.226 --> 14:33.669
I'm thinking.

14:33.670 --> 14:34.839
You watch people long enough,

14:34.840 --> 14:37.563
you see that everyone
has their patterns.

14:37.564 --> 14:41.149
What about a childhood
home? A favorite place?

14:41.150 --> 14:43.195
Maybe something related to an old job?

14:44.560 --> 14:45.980
Good thinking.

14:50.440 --> 14:51.529
You're in early.

14:51.530 --> 14:54.029
Uh, oh. I...

14:54.030 --> 14:56.949
I never actually went home.

14:56.950 --> 14:59.899
Listen, don't beat yourself up.
You did a great job last night.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.459
Remember, she knows the playbook.

15:02.460 --> 15:03.539
We'll catch her.

15:03.540 --> 15:06.135
No, that's not it.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.639
What exactly did Esme do?

15:10.640 --> 15:13.439
I mean, I know she's tagged, but...

15:13.440 --> 15:15.579
Vivian, I know you really
care about this job,

15:15.580 --> 15:17.219
and you have a big heart.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.539
But that's not always a good thing,

15:19.540 --> 15:20.879
and I know that sounds callus, but...

15:20.880 --> 15:24.730
No, I... I get it. We
have to remain impartial.

15:30.220 --> 15:34.499
When Esme betrayed the
department, it was...

15:34.500 --> 15:37.489
Yeah, it was hard on all of us.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.046
So why do you think she did it?

15:44.047 --> 15:46.979
Um...

15:46.980 --> 15:48.259
I don't know.

15:48.260 --> 15:50.629
Because she cared too much.

15:50.630 --> 15:52.079
She got personally involved

15:52.080 --> 15:54.558
instead of letting the
system do its job.

15:55.920 --> 15:58.060
It's important to trust the NFFA.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.560
I understand.

16:18.360 --> 16:19.910
Kelen.

16:22.330 --> 16:23.579
What?

16:25.310 --> 16:26.349
Open up my bag.

16:26.350 --> 16:28.008
There's something I wanna show you.

16:31.762 --> 16:34.729
Please...

16:34.730 --> 16:36.139
just do it.

16:36.140 --> 16:38.639
Why? Let's just listen
to music like you said.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.059
Kelen...

16:40.060 --> 16:42.389
it's important.

16:42.390 --> 16:44.119
Do this for me.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.639
I already saw.

16:45.640 --> 16:48.528
I saw it. I... I... I saw the mask.

16:51.949 --> 16:53.879
I know you did.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.649
But you didn't call the cops.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.819
You know what that means, right?

17:06.797 --> 17:07.959
What?

17:09.640 --> 17:12.510
It means you care about me.

17:15.099 --> 17:18.057
Of course I do, Ben.

17:19.660 --> 17:21.279
After what happened on Purge Night,

17:21.280 --> 17:25.638
I... I couldn't stop thinking about it.

17:25.640 --> 17:27.069
I was on the edge all the time,

17:27.069 --> 17:29.949
just waiting for
something bad to happen.

17:32.698 --> 17:34.657
The farmer, when he grabbed me,

17:34.658 --> 17:37.540
I... I just reacted.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.830
But then afterward, I...

17:42.833 --> 17:45.040
I felt better.

17:46.180 --> 17:48.039
I felt great.

17:52.580 --> 17:55.399
I think it's very brave

17:55.400 --> 17:57.931
that you can talk to me about all this.

17:59.220 --> 18:01.329
It's so honest.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.459
It is,

18:03.460 --> 18:05.359
and the fact that you
see I'm the same guy,

18:05.360 --> 18:06.559
that... that's real.

18:06.560 --> 18:09.730
That... that shows the kind
of connection we have.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.160
I feel like it brings
us closer together.

18:25.790 --> 18:27.749
I love you so much.

18:32.930 --> 18:34.468
But it still scares you.

18:36.100 --> 18:37.300
No.

18:38.640 --> 18:40.720
You keep doing that
thing with your neck.

18:57.240 --> 18:58.908
I didn't want it to be like this.

19:04.170 --> 19:06.159
Here...

19:06.160 --> 19:07.625
take it.

19:12.830 --> 19:15.675
I want you to feel completely safe.

19:34.580 --> 19:38.320
You know, maybe I'll give it some time.

19:38.323 --> 19:40.819
I don't think you'll
ever convince that man.

19:40.820 --> 19:43.159
You can't reason with grief.

19:43.160 --> 19:44.760
You're right.

19:44.770 --> 19:47.331
I mean, did you see the
look on their faces?

19:47.332 --> 19:49.289
They were scared.

19:49.290 --> 19:52.320
I mean, he's dangerous.

19:53.610 --> 19:55.579
I'll pack a couple of bags
and send for the rest.

19:55.580 --> 19:58.420
You guys are leaving?

19:59.620 --> 20:01.260
- Darren?
- Are you all right?

20:02.740 --> 20:05.260
Uh, yeah, you just said
you're leaving, right?

20:05.267 --> 20:07.727
It's a long story.

20:07.728 --> 20:09.603
Okay, I'm coming with you.

20:09.604 --> 20:11.731
Darren, honey, we have to leave today.

20:11.732 --> 20:13.299
No, I'm... that's fine. I'm coming with.

20:13.300 --> 20:16.653
Son, what's wrong?

20:17.960 --> 20:19.690
I think I'm in trouble, Dad.

20:21.560 --> 20:22.779
What's going on?

20:22.780 --> 20:24.719
Okay, I messed with the wrong guys,

20:24.720 --> 20:26.260
and I think they're
coming to Purge me now.

20:26.270 --> 20:27.830
Come on.

20:30.250 --> 20:32.699
It's okay.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.279
Hey, look at me.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.465
You're coming with us.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.507
Let's go.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.279
Mom!

20:44.280 --> 20:46.199
Mom! I'm her son.

20:46.200 --> 20:49.644
Ryan, honey, what...
why aren't you in school?

20:50.880 --> 20:52.140
It got canceled.

20:56.350 --> 20:57.939
Uh, uh, let's get you home.

20:57.940 --> 20:59.629
- I'll get her home safe.
- Oh, hold on there, sir.

20:59.630 --> 21:01.405
We need to get a little
information here.

21:01.406 --> 21:02.782
Let me start with your ID.

21:23.493 --> 21:24.553
Ryan Grant.

21:24.554 --> 21:26.138
That's it.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.519
You're retired NOPD.

21:35.520 --> 21:38.569
Well, old timers retire.

21:38.570 --> 21:40.499
- I just kicked the habit early.
- Right on.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.739
We pulled up an Alice
Grant with an address

21:42.740 --> 21:46.099
listed at Lafayette Assisted
Living over on Dorgenois.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.199
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's it.

21:47.200 --> 21:48.719
I've got my truck here.
I can get her home.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.879
- Okay, we'll back you back.
- I don't want to trouble you.

21:50.880 --> 21:54.500
Oh, no trouble at all, man.
Anything for a vet.

22:00.924 --> 22:02.842
Where are we going now, honey?

22:06.179 --> 22:07.763
Is this your truck here?

22:07.764 --> 22:09.640
Yeah, it's right here.

22:12.227 --> 22:13.686
I got it.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.219
Here we go.

22:17.220 --> 22:19.399
All right, here I go.

22:19.400 --> 22:20.439
Uh-huh.

22:21.610 --> 22:23.319
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.640
No problem. Y'all drive safe now.

22:53.270 --> 22:54.603
You hot?

22:55.680 --> 22:58.019
I'll turn on the AC.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.110
There's a gas station up ahead.

23:03.300 --> 23:05.859
I'm gonna stop.

23:41.940 --> 23:43.270
Where are you going?

23:44.700 --> 23:46.070
I have to use the bathroom.

23:47.240 --> 23:48.609
Okay.

23:52.720 --> 23:54.470
Oh, wait.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.870
Uh, can I borrow your phone?

23:57.874 --> 24:00.209
Uh, mine's dead.

24:00.210 --> 24:01.299
I need to call my mom

24:01.300 --> 24:03.340
and let her know I left
something back at the house.

25:01.390 --> 25:05.079
_

25:05.080 --> 25:07.480
_

25:30.980 --> 25:33.489
Thanks for letting me use your phone.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.089
You ready to go?

26:07.060 --> 26:09.979
_

26:09.980 --> 26:11.590
Drew Adams.

26:26.470 --> 26:28.219
- Hello?
- Vivian?

26:28.220 --> 26:29.399
You saw my flyers?

26:29.400 --> 26:30.839
Photo got my attention.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.775
How the hell did you
know where to post them?

26:32.776 --> 26:34.619
I, uh, paid some people to plaster them

26:34.620 --> 26:36.157
around dead zones where
you were last spotted.

26:36.158 --> 26:38.919
You could get arrested
for talking to me.

26:38.920 --> 26:40.819
They might even have you wired by now.

26:40.820 --> 26:43.809
No, I'm not. It's safe. I just...

26:43.810 --> 26:46.299
I did a keystroke analysis
on your work station

26:46.300 --> 26:47.499
before they erased it.

26:47.500 --> 26:50.419
I saw what you did...
the deleted footage.

26:50.420 --> 26:53.279
Hey, whatever you do, do
not mention that footage

26:53.280 --> 26:55.019
or that case to anyone.

26:55.020 --> 26:56.759
Do you understand? Not even Curtis.

26:56.760 --> 26:58.759
I won't, but it's against regulation

26:58.760 --> 27:00.779
to tamper with footage like that.

27:00.780 --> 27:02.015
Did you do it?

27:03.930 --> 27:05.539
I...

27:05.540 --> 27:06.849
Of course not.

27:06.850 --> 27:08.640
What did you do?

27:08.650 --> 27:10.899
They... they... they won't
give me a straight answer,

27:10.900 --> 27:12.527
Curtis just skirts the issue.

27:13.520 --> 27:15.529
I didn't do anything wrong.

27:15.530 --> 27:18.119
How do I know that for sure?

27:18.120 --> 27:19.319
You don't.

27:19.320 --> 27:21.159
Listen to me.

27:21.160 --> 27:23.739
You cannot trust anyone.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.859
How about you? Can I trust you?

27:28.860 --> 27:31.559
Because there is something very wrong,

27:31.560 --> 27:32.922
and I don't know what to do.

27:36.320 --> 27:38.239
You can help me.

27:48.813 --> 27:51.060
What are you looking for?

27:52.100 --> 27:55.319
I was just, um, checking my makeup.

28:00.260 --> 28:03.859
So I was thinking after finals,

28:03.860 --> 28:06.789
maybe we take a trip somewhere?

28:07.700 --> 28:10.959
Wouldn't that be fun?

28:10.960 --> 28:14.540
Or we can save our money
for an apartment.

28:15.620 --> 28:18.550
If we finally had our own
place, we can get a puppy.

28:18.551 --> 28:20.239
Hmm?

28:28.000 --> 28:29.310
Ben?

28:31.810 --> 28:34.269
Where are we going? Ben?

28:34.270 --> 28:36.150
Ben!

28:44.130 --> 28:45.452
What are you doing?

28:45.453 --> 28:47.288
Ben?

28:48.140 --> 28:49.415
Ben?

28:59.676 --> 29:02.219
Looks like they're
stopping traffic ahead.

29:07.370 --> 29:10.186
_

29:11.630 --> 29:13.779
All right, keep moving.

29:13.780 --> 29:16.108
Pull up. Pull up.

29:18.695 --> 29:20.112
Hi, Officer.

29:20.113 --> 29:21.779
Evening, sir.

29:21.780 --> 29:23.460
I need everyone's identification.

29:23.470 --> 29:27.399
Yes, sir. I'm reaching for it right now.

29:27.400 --> 29:29.122
Come on, guys.

29:31.080 --> 29:32.500
- Got it?
- Yeah.

29:36.980 --> 29:38.750
I'll be right back.

29:41.500 --> 29:43.519
I don't mind Mississippi.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.972
- It's so green here.
- Hmm.

29:48.170 --> 29:50.619
I'm afraid we have a problem.

29:50.620 --> 29:51.759
What's wrong?

29:51.760 --> 29:53.893
You and your wife are free to continue,

29:53.894 --> 29:55.909
but, sir, you're on our No Travel list.

29:55.910 --> 29:57.779
I can't let you across the state line.

29:57.780 --> 29:59.019
Wait, that's not right.

29:59.020 --> 30:01.028
Uh, is that some sort of mistake?

30:01.029 --> 30:03.009
The list comes straight from the NFFA.

30:03.010 --> 30:05.179
There's nothing I can do.

30:05.180 --> 30:06.949
Please turn around.

30:06.950 --> 30:08.320
Look, Dad, it's not a mistake.

30:09.454 --> 30:10.955
What are you talking about?

30:11.960 --> 30:15.779
Look, the trouble that I'm
in is not with some guys.

30:15.780 --> 30:17.210
It's the government.

30:18.880 --> 30:21.559
Okay, you... you guys should
probably just go on without me.

30:21.560 --> 30:23.929
Please, I can't have something
happen to you guys because of me.

30:23.930 --> 30:27.259
Darren, no. Can't leave my son.

30:35.188 --> 30:36.938
Why?

30:36.939 --> 30:38.939
Please don't do this.

30:38.940 --> 30:42.419
- Why did you write this?
- I was scared.

30:42.420 --> 30:45.989
I'm sorry, but I'm so scared.

30:45.990 --> 30:47.989
It's just because you don't understand.

30:47.990 --> 30:50.989
I don't want to understand.

30:50.990 --> 30:52.747
It's sick, Ben.

30:53.700 --> 30:54.899
You're always going to be afraid

30:54.900 --> 30:57.752
until you see for yourself.

30:59.300 --> 31:01.769
I need you to do something for me.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.593
What?

31:10.010 --> 31:11.515
Pick up the knife. Let me show you.

31:11.516 --> 31:13.759
No. No, no, no. I... I can't.

31:13.760 --> 31:16.779
Kelen, do this for me.

31:16.780 --> 31:18.439
Pick up the knife and I'll show you.

31:20.020 --> 31:21.689
Come on!

31:23.190 --> 31:24.260
Good.

31:25.180 --> 31:26.379
Now I want you to cut me.

31:26.380 --> 31:27.679
What? No!

31:27.680 --> 31:30.120
Come on. It's okay.

31:31.200 --> 31:33.412
I'll be here to help you.

31:35.700 --> 31:37.539
You just got to give yourself permission

31:37.540 --> 31:39.585
to let go of all the guilt and the fear.

31:39.586 --> 31:42.179
Come on.

31:44.660 --> 31:46.549
That's it.

31:46.550 --> 31:49.500
Yeah. Come on! Yeah.

31:53.349 --> 31:55.559
Yeah, come on. Do it!

31:55.560 --> 31:56.840
Do it!

32:00.857 --> 32:02.274
What the fuck?

32:15.788 --> 32:17.479
Kelen!

32:22.190 --> 32:24.620
Kelen, wait!

32:28.940 --> 32:31.470
Kelen!

32:32.472 --> 32:35.266
Kelen!

32:36.767 --> 32:38.459
Kelen!

32:41.981 --> 32:43.982
Hey! Help me!

32:47.530 --> 32:50.140
Kelen, wait!

32:50.156 --> 32:51.324
Kelen, wait!

33:01.792 --> 33:02.879
Oh, my God.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.379
Oh, fuck.

33:04.380 --> 33:06.049
Oh, fuck!

33:06.050 --> 33:07.423
Oh!

33:09.842 --> 33:12.099
Man, I didn't even...
even want to hit her.

33:12.100 --> 33:15.789
She ran right into the road,
dude. I just... are you...

33:15.790 --> 33:18.799
oh, fuck. I've got to call 911!

35:33.070 --> 35:34.730
Jesus.

35:36.960 --> 35:39.240
That was way too close.

35:41.340 --> 35:42.899
Play time's over.

35:42.900 --> 35:45.409
I'm gonna get you a passport
and get you out of here.

35:45.410 --> 35:47.541
I already told you I'm not leaving.

35:47.542 --> 35:50.469
Hey, the cops almost caught you today.

35:50.470 --> 35:52.252
You stay here, you're as good as dead.

35:52.253 --> 35:55.257
When shit went upside down
for you, did you run?

35:55.258 --> 35:57.709
Do you wanna know why?

35:57.710 --> 36:01.309
Because I have people
here that depend on me,

36:01.310 --> 36:02.679
and I'm not gonna put my team

36:02.680 --> 36:04.499
or my mother in that kind of danger.

36:04.500 --> 36:06.879
Yeah, well, I have people too.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.949
People that were hurt by the NFFA,

36:08.950 --> 36:10.314
and I was part of that.

36:10.315 --> 36:13.899
People like Dr. Adams

36:13.900 --> 36:15.900
and Olivia Hughes.

36:17.860 --> 36:19.532
And Tommy.

36:22.930 --> 36:24.912
What do you know about Tommy?

36:25.870 --> 36:27.869
The morning after Purge Night,

36:27.870 --> 36:30.789
when Tommy crossed the line...

36:30.790 --> 36:36.256
I was the one who tagged him.

36:42.680 --> 36:46.267
My best friend is gonna die
in there because of you.

36:47.620 --> 36:49.719
I know.

36:49.720 --> 36:51.772
I'm so sorry.

36:53.400 --> 36:55.199
Why are you telling me this?

36:55.200 --> 36:56.360
Don't you get it?

36:57.930 --> 37:01.919
This is why I have to stay.
I have to set things right.

37:01.920 --> 37:04.679
I told myself it was just a
job, and if it wasn't me,

37:04.680 --> 37:06.161
somebody else would have to do it.

37:06.162 --> 37:07.999
But I can't think that way anymore.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.240
- You need to leave.
- I need to help.

37:10.250 --> 37:12.309
Please, just let me stay.

37:12.310 --> 37:13.579
Please.

37:13.580 --> 37:18.789
I don't give a fuck what you do,

37:18.790 --> 37:21.629
but you're not staying here.

37:40.446 --> 37:43.599
Guys, are you sure about this?

37:43.600 --> 37:46.367
We shouldn't have never run.

37:49.170 --> 37:52.779
I mean, why should we leave
everything that we worked for?

37:52.780 --> 37:54.249
For some old psycho?

37:54.250 --> 37:59.779
Okay, you got guys like
Clint all over this country.

37:59.780 --> 38:02.464
Some of them, they're
running this country.

38:02.465 --> 38:05.429
But if we run now,
we'll be running forever.

38:05.430 --> 38:07.029
And I ain't running.

38:07.030 --> 38:09.610
All right? We ain't running.

38:14.970 --> 38:16.750
Mm-mm.

38:34.120 --> 38:37.749
I wanna say thanks for everything.

38:42.650 --> 38:46.279
The way you feel about Tommy...

38:46.280 --> 38:48.055
The way it eats at you...

38:49.570 --> 38:52.685
I'm carrying that for
a lot of people I hurt.

38:54.240 --> 38:56.239
You know...

38:56.240 --> 39:00.349
some new person is
sitting at my old desk,

39:00.350 --> 39:03.749
pressing the buttons I used to press,

39:03.750 --> 39:05.819
tagging new Tommys every day,

39:05.820 --> 39:09.049
sending good people to prison...

39:09.050 --> 39:10.786
or worse.

39:12.060 --> 39:17.289
And that is why I had to blow
up this whole fucking thing.

39:29.370 --> 39:31.259
Wait.

39:42.220 --> 39:45.600
