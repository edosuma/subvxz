02:15.273 --> 02:16.799
Come on man, let's get in the picture.

02:16.800 --> 02:17.951
Big smile.

02:17.952 --> 02:18.785
Woo, woo!

02:20.215 --> 02:21.360
Who wants to make money?

02:21.361 --> 02:22.894
Yeah!

04:27.331 --> 04:28.164
Hello?

04:36.252 --> 04:37.085
Hello?

04:40.501 --> 04:42.084
Can anyone hear me?

04:55.596 --> 04:56.429
Hello?

05:05.028 --> 05:06.996
Hello, hello?

05:06.997 --> 05:08.878
Ryan, is that you?

05:08.879 --> 05:10.188
Bruce?

05:10.189 --> 05:11.389
What the fuck is going on?

05:11.390 --> 05:12.507
Where have you been?

05:12.508 --> 05:13.788
I need your help.

05:13.789 --> 05:16.031
They want money.

05:16.032 --> 05:17.794
What are you talking about?

05:17.795 --> 05:18.922
They took me...

05:18.923 --> 05:20.399
Who took you?

05:20.400 --> 05:21.602
Took you where?

05:21.603 --> 05:23.439
You have to get me out of here.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.078
Where are you?

05:25.079 --> 05:25.911
It's so hot...

05:25.912 --> 05:26.744
Slow down.

05:26.745 --> 05:28.044
Tell me where you are.

05:28.045 --> 05:29.028
Small room.

05:29.029 --> 05:29.861
Metal.

05:29.862 --> 05:31.895
There's a heavy door.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.431
It's locked.

05:33.432 --> 05:35.412
Heat is coming down from the ceiling.

05:35.413 --> 05:37.913
The temperature's rising fast.

05:39.370 --> 05:41.519
Is there a small window?

05:41.520 --> 05:42.352
Yes.

05:42.353 --> 05:43.372
A small window...

05:43.373 --> 05:44.873
How did you know?

05:45.940 --> 05:49.286
'Cause I think we're in the same place.

05:49.287 --> 05:53.103
We're gonna die Ryan, we're gonna die!

05:53.104 --> 05:57.754
Hey...
We're not gonna die.

05:58.614 --> 06:01.106
Oh jeez, alright.

06:01.107 --> 06:04.024
I'm gonna figure this out, okay?

06:06.152 --> 06:06.984
Hang on.

06:06.985 --> 06:08.262
Just hang on a second.

06:08.263 --> 06:09.430
Wait a minute.

06:12.355 --> 06:13.519
Can you hear that?

06:13.520 --> 06:16.099
Tell me if you can hear this...

06:16.100 --> 06:16.932
I think so.

06:16.933 --> 06:17.765
I don't know.

06:17.766 --> 06:18.598
The banging!

06:18.599 --> 06:19.431
Can you hear the banging?

06:19.432 --> 06:21.401
I'm hot.

06:21.402 --> 06:24.213
They're turning up the heat here...

06:24.214 --> 06:25.520
Help me...

06:25.521 --> 06:27.604
I'm trying to help you!

06:29.135 --> 06:29.967
What about this?

06:32.025 --> 06:33.525
Can you hear this?

06:34.436 --> 06:36.151
What's going on, Ryan?

06:36.152 --> 06:36.985
Ryan?

06:41.397 --> 06:42.230
Hello?

06:43.482 --> 06:45.899
Hello, is anybody out there?

06:52.289 --> 06:54.104
Do you remember who took you?

06:54.105 --> 06:54.937
No.

06:54.938 --> 06:55.938
I just...

06:55.939 --> 06:56.771
Woke up...

06:56.772 --> 06:57.604
And I was...

06:57.605 --> 06:58.437
Here.

06:58.438 --> 07:00.345
Tell me everything
that you can remember.

07:00.346 --> 07:01.948
I was at the hotel...

07:01.949 --> 07:02.781
I think...

07:02.782 --> 07:05.032
Yeah, with those two girls.

07:06.113 --> 07:07.280
No, no please!

07:08.165 --> 07:09.759
What's happening?

07:09.760 --> 07:10.592
Turn it off.

07:10.593 --> 07:11.425
Bruce?

07:11.426 --> 07:12.561
Turn it off!

07:12.562 --> 07:13.946
No, please, don't...

07:13.947 --> 07:14.798
Please!

07:14.799 --> 07:16.106
Just make it stop!

07:16.107 --> 07:17.248
Make it stop!

07:18.082 --> 07:19.225
I'm burning!

07:19.226 --> 07:20.676
I'm fucking burning!

07:20.677 --> 07:21.574
Help me!

07:21.575 --> 07:22.407
Help me!

07:25.828 --> 07:26.661
Bruce?

07:28.972 --> 07:29.805
Bruce?

07:34.158 --> 07:34.991
Bruce?

07:36.748 --> 07:37.581
Bruce?

07:44.007 --> 07:44.839
Your call has been forwarded

07:44.840 --> 07:47.923
to an automatic voice message system.

07:57.822 --> 07:59.489
Let me outta here!

08:23.542 --> 08:27.709
Do I have your undivided
attention, Mister Hinds?

08:32.385 --> 08:34.552
How do you know my name?

08:36.738 --> 08:38.597
You don't get to ask anything

08:38.599 --> 08:43.025
but I will give you the chance
to figure out the answer.

08:43.025 --> 08:46.075
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

08:46.076 --> 08:47.887
It means you get one shot

08:47.888 --> 08:49.888
at answering a question.

08:50.950 --> 08:53.864
You're fucking crazy...

08:53.865 --> 08:55.738
That may be the case...

08:55.739 --> 08:58.239
But you're the one locked up.

08:59.168 --> 09:02.168
You wait until I get out of here.

09:03.705 --> 09:08.299
That could be sooner than you think...

09:08.300 --> 09:12.467
Guess the answer and I'll
let you walk free right now.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.447
What's the question?

09:16.448 --> 09:17.563
Two minutes...

09:17.564 --> 09:19.981
As many guesses as you want.

09:20.838 --> 09:22.903
What's the question?

09:22.904 --> 09:26.011
Just guess who I am, Mister Hinds.

09:26.012 --> 09:29.679
Say my name and this
can all end right now.

09:30.751 --> 09:31.751
Two minutes.

09:57.007 --> 09:59.221
You're wasting your time.

09:59.222 --> 10:02.722
What are you hoping to
achieve, Mister Hinds?

10:02.723 --> 10:05.103
Look, I arrived in Houston last night...

10:05.104 --> 10:06.772
We signed a big deal...

10:06.773 --> 10:07.605
We were celebrating.

10:07.606 --> 10:11.689
I Met with the investors
for a drink with Bruce.

10:15.707 --> 10:18.622
There were two girls there,

10:18.623 --> 10:20.092
Erika and Mandy...

10:20.093 --> 10:20.926
Mindy...

10:27.756 --> 10:29.089
The investors...

10:29.937 --> 10:31.411
I don't know.

10:31.412 --> 10:34.487
The investors, you're one of them.

10:34.488 --> 10:36.321
What were their names?

10:37.890 --> 10:39.522
Luke...

10:39.523 --> 10:40.690
Luke Farell...

10:41.541 --> 10:42.963
Luke Farell.

10:42.964 --> 10:44.020
Karl...

10:44.021 --> 10:47.271
Karl, Karl, what the fuck is your name?

10:49.317 --> 10:50.149
Giussani!

10:50.150 --> 10:51.244
Luke Farell, Karl Giussani

10:51.245 --> 10:52.578
and Bob Makeson.

10:54.797 --> 10:55.629
One of them!

10:55.630 --> 10:57.213
You're one of them!

10:58.333 --> 10:59.427
Which one?

10:59.428 --> 11:00.668
I don't know!

11:03.504 --> 11:05.754
How the fuck should I know?

11:08.255 --> 11:09.338
Oh fuck you.

11:13.442 --> 11:15.829
Wrong answer.

11:22.832 --> 11:24.165
Hey, the heat!

11:26.519 --> 11:28.029
Can you hear me?

11:28.030 --> 11:29.530
Turn the heat off!

11:30.467 --> 11:32.031
What the?

11:32.032 --> 11:32.865
Jesus.

11:41.577 --> 11:42.812
Oh God.

11:44.338 --> 11:45.171
Fuck!

12:00.993 --> 12:01.826
Okay.

12:03.507 --> 12:04.339
I'll do whatever you want.

12:04.340 --> 12:05.578
Do you hear me?

12:05.579 --> 12:07.403
Just tell me what you want me to do.

12:07.404 --> 12:09.571
I'll do whatever you want!

12:14.016 --> 12:16.693
Those are the magic words, Mister Hinds.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.027
Whatever I want.

12:43.388 --> 12:47.846
Do you know the story of
the frog in boiling water?

12:47.847 --> 12:51.913
If you place a frog in water
and heat it slowly enough,

12:51.914 --> 12:54.794
the frog will not jump out.

12:54.795 --> 12:58.059
And the frog will be cooked alive.

12:58.060 --> 13:00.651
I'm afraid you're that frog.

13:00.652 --> 13:03.951
How and if you die here
is totally up to you

13:03.952 --> 13:05.018
but I can assure you

13:05.019 --> 13:08.042
that perspiration stains
on your $300 shirt

13:08.043 --> 13:10.543
are the least of your worries.

13:13.646 --> 13:16.146
It's a $500 shirt, asshole.

13:17.259 --> 13:19.109
Lets see if you're still joking

13:19.110 --> 13:21.326
when your flesh will start to cook

13:21.327 --> 13:25.885
and your lungs will be
seared by dry hot air.

13:25.886 --> 13:26.719
Alright.

13:30.264 --> 13:34.264
If you're trying to scare
me, I'm scared, okay?

13:35.496 --> 13:37.307
Good.

13:37.308 --> 13:40.631
Now that you understand the
seriousness of your situation

13:40.632 --> 13:42.600
I think we can begin.

13:42.601 --> 13:45.101
Just tell me what you want.

13:47.449 --> 13:50.615
All in good time...

13:50.616 --> 13:53.699
For now I need you to get the phone.

14:06.039 --> 14:07.290
What now?

14:07.291 --> 14:11.728
I want you to focus on the task at hand.

14:11.729 --> 14:12.979
I'm focused.

14:13.875 --> 14:18.128
I want one million dollars
of your money.

14:18.129 --> 14:18.962
What?

14:21.026 --> 14:22.955
A million dollars...

14:22.956 --> 14:24.358
Hey,

14:24.359 --> 14:27.143
I don't have access
to that kind of money.

14:27.144 --> 14:29.727
You have two hours.

14:30.672 --> 14:31.862
Two hours?

14:32.977 --> 14:37.159
The room is now exactly
100 degrees Fahrenheit.

14:37.160 --> 14:41.874
Every 5 minutes that goes by
without me being a millionaire,

14:41.875 --> 14:46.042
will cause the temperature
to rise three degrees.

14:48.422 --> 14:50.678
You have already sweat profusely,

14:50.679 --> 14:54.679
therefor your tolerance
for heat has diminished.

14:55.773 --> 14:58.132
You've already felt what
I can do Mister Hinds,

14:58.133 --> 15:00.161
I suggest you get started.

15:00.162 --> 15:01.329
Okay look...

15:03.160 --> 15:05.660
I'm just a regular family guy.

15:07.108 --> 15:09.775
I don't have that kind of money.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.927
Not my problem.

15:16.060 --> 15:17.525
I can't do it in two hours...

15:17.526 --> 15:19.493
Okay, I just can't...

15:19.494 --> 15:21.015
Even if I sold

15:21.016 --> 15:24.699
the car, and the house, everything...

15:24.700 --> 15:27.700
It could take me weeks, months even.

15:31.238 --> 15:32.988
Look, I don't know...

15:34.742 --> 15:38.593
I don't know what or who you think I am?

15:38.594 --> 15:40.069
You've wasted over a minute

15:40.070 --> 15:41.903
trying to convince me.

15:42.829 --> 15:44.796
I suggest you use the rest of the time

15:44.797 --> 15:47.952
to start transferring funds.

15:47.953 --> 15:48.785
Funds...

15:48.786 --> 15:49.741
What funds?

15:49.742 --> 15:50.825
Jesus Christ!

15:51.871 --> 15:54.531
I work with wealthy investors

15:54.532 --> 15:56.547
but I'm just a broker...

15:56.548 --> 15:58.215
You understand that?

16:01.757 --> 16:05.674
I have a wife and a kid
waiting for me at home.

16:12.883 --> 16:14.800
That's my wife, Anna...

16:18.406 --> 16:19.775
We're not rich.

16:19.776 --> 16:21.723
She fucking works as a teacher part-time

16:21.724 --> 16:23.807
to help pay the mortgage.

16:29.210 --> 16:30.657
This is my son...

16:30.658 --> 16:32.770
Larry is 7.

16:32.771 --> 16:36.778
He broke his leg last year
learning how to ice skate.

16:36.779 --> 16:40.221
We know everything
about you Mister Hinds.

16:40.222 --> 16:42.225
We know more than you think.

16:42.226 --> 16:44.290
What school you went to...

16:44.291 --> 16:47.109
How old you were when you
stopped wetting the bed...

16:47.110 --> 16:48.417
The names of every man

16:48.418 --> 16:51.668
your wife dated before she married you.

16:54.322 --> 16:55.490
Well then if you know all this

16:55.491 --> 16:56.956
then you know I don't
have this kind of money...

16:56.957 --> 16:59.707
So you might as well kill me now.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.221
Alright, alright.

17:24.068 --> 17:25.818
I'll get you money...

17:26.698 --> 17:27.883
I can't get you a million dollars

17:27.884 --> 17:28.716
but I'll give you
everything that I have.

17:28.717 --> 17:31.139
Please just let me out of here.

17:31.140 --> 17:32.387
Okay?

17:32.388 --> 17:34.814
I don't need two hours.

17:34.815 --> 17:36.648
I can do it right now.

17:37.716 --> 17:40.164
I'll give you everything
that I have, okay?

17:40.165 --> 17:42.082
Please, just let me go.

17:44.407 --> 17:46.876
Okay look, that's everything.

17:46.877 --> 17:48.135
That's all that I have.

17:48.136 --> 17:48.969
Please.

17:51.856 --> 17:52.689
Hello?

18:03.446 --> 18:04.946
Come on, come on.

18:13.596 --> 18:14.988
Twenty third precinct...

18:14.989 --> 18:17.322
How can I direct your call?

18:18.276 --> 18:19.526
Sergeant John Hinds please...

18:19.527 --> 18:20.359
It's urgent.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.163
And who, may I ask, is calling?

18:22.164 --> 18:23.964
This is his brother...

18:23.965 --> 18:25.271
Ryan Hinds.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.380
Please wait a moment.

18:26.381 --> 18:28.359
No, don't put me on hold.

18:32.367 --> 18:34.450
Please pick up the phone.

18:38.007 --> 18:40.424
Come on John, please pick up.

18:45.065 --> 18:47.547
I'm putting you through now, Sir.

18:47.548 --> 18:48.482
Ryan?

18:48.483 --> 18:49.316
John...

18:51.001 --> 18:52.501
I need your help.

18:53.410 --> 18:54.523
Help?

18:54.524 --> 18:56.743
You need my help?

18:56.744 --> 18:58.112
Yes...

18:58.113 --> 18:59.780
Yes, it's important.

19:00.728 --> 19:01.560
Must be...

19:01.561 --> 19:04.039
You haven't been in touch for
almost a year and a half...

19:04.040 --> 19:07.544
If it wasn't for mom I'd
thought you were dead.

19:07.545 --> 19:10.484
John I've been fucking kidnapped!

19:10.485 --> 19:11.902
By who?

19:13.977 --> 19:17.144
They have me locked in a furnace...

19:18.860 --> 19:20.888
They say they're going to cook me.

19:20.889 --> 19:21.932
I need you to calm down

19:21.933 --> 19:24.043
and tell me who is doing this to you.

19:24.044 --> 19:26.377
I have no fucking idea...

19:27.588 --> 19:28.884
But they say they're gonna kill me

19:28.885 --> 19:31.644
if I give them a lot of fucking money.

19:31.645 --> 19:33.228
How much?

19:37.491 --> 19:39.241
A million dollars.

19:40.418 --> 19:42.292
Jesus, how much do you have?

19:42.293 --> 19:43.435
Not enough.

19:43.436 --> 19:44.268
What about Anna and Larry?

19:44.269 --> 19:46.042
Are they okay?

19:46.043 --> 19:47.293
I don't know.

19:48.814 --> 19:50.854
I'll get a squad car
over to you A.S.A.P.

19:50.855 --> 19:53.925
I need you to leave your
phone turned on at all times.

19:53.926 --> 19:56.771
I'll need to be able to
trace your location...

19:56.772 --> 19:57.855
Okay, okay.

19:58.834 --> 19:59.667
Thank you.

20:00.838 --> 20:03.273
I really hope you aren't
wasting your call time,

20:03.274 --> 20:05.073
Mister Hinds.

20:05.074 --> 20:06.241
I gotta go.

20:09.923 --> 20:12.923
Who were you talking to?

20:16.050 --> 20:16.997
None of your business.

20:16.998 --> 20:19.281
I'm trying to get you your money.

20:19.282 --> 20:20.813
Until we're done here,

20:20.814 --> 20:23.527
everything you do is my business...

20:23.528 --> 20:25.945
Now who were you talking to?

20:30.451 --> 20:31.284
Nobody.

20:32.490 --> 20:33.677
Nobody?

20:33.678 --> 20:34.781
You could simply say

20:34.782 --> 20:38.282
you were talking to
your brother, the cop.

20:39.631 --> 20:43.631
Do you really think he
can help you out of this?

21:07.423 --> 21:08.423
Okay look.

21:09.849 --> 21:11.885
You want my money, take this.

21:11.886 --> 21:16.483
It was my father's watch,
worth at least $10,000.

21:16.484 --> 21:18.605
I have no need for a watch...

21:18.606 --> 21:20.453
Expensive or not.

21:20.454 --> 21:23.166
Just take it and let me go.

21:23.167 --> 21:24.834
Smash it.

21:26.275 --> 21:27.822
Why?

21:27.823 --> 21:30.971
You're throwing away $10,000.

21:30.972 --> 21:33.222
I said smash it!

22:15.941 --> 22:18.106
Hello?

22:18.107 --> 22:20.386
Hey Honey, it's me.

22:20.387 --> 22:21.443
Hi you...

22:21.444 --> 22:23.003
How's Houston?

22:23.004 --> 22:24.670
I need you to listen
to me very carefully

22:24.671 --> 22:27.538
and do what I say and
don't ask any questions.

22:27.539 --> 22:29.482
Are you okay?

22:29.483 --> 22:31.318
I said no questions.

22:31.319 --> 22:33.573
You don't sound okay.

22:33.574 --> 22:36.322
Look, I'm in a bit of trouble,

22:36.323 --> 22:40.330
financial trouble, and I need
you to do something for me.

22:40.331 --> 22:41.602
Have you been gambling again?

22:41.603 --> 22:43.068
No...

22:43.069 --> 22:45.236
It's nothing like that...

22:46.391 --> 22:49.308
I'm sending you an account number.

22:50.891 --> 22:53.938
What do I do with it?

22:53.939 --> 22:56.115
It's an account number

22:56.116 --> 22:59.647
and I need you to transfer
all the cash you can into it.

22:59.648 --> 23:01.781
The joint account savings?

23:01.782 --> 23:02.615
No...

23:03.881 --> 23:05.631
That's already gone.

23:07.457 --> 23:10.263
Then what do you expect me to transfer?

23:10.264 --> 23:11.104
The money you made from

23:11.105 --> 23:13.576
selling the properties
your old man left you.

23:13.577 --> 23:14.475
That money...

23:14.476 --> 23:16.289
We agreed was for Larry.

23:16.290 --> 23:18.629
You transfer the money Anna,

23:18.630 --> 23:20.204
you do it now or bad
things are going to happen.

23:20.205 --> 23:22.086
Do you understand me?

23:22.087 --> 23:23.742
Ryan, are you threatening me?

23:23.743 --> 23:24.576
No!

23:25.931 --> 23:27.821
I'm trying to keep us above water.

23:27.822 --> 23:30.322
I will get it back I promise!

23:34.134 --> 23:35.467
Will you do it?

23:41.197 --> 23:43.883
Yeah, I'll do it.

23:43.884 --> 23:44.884
Thank you.

23:47.533 --> 23:49.366
As fast as you can...

23:51.828 --> 23:52.828
I love you.

23:54.360 --> 23:55.192
I love y...

23:59.954 --> 24:01.222
Mom, it's me, it's Ryan.

24:01.223 --> 24:03.523
I know who it is...

24:03.524 --> 24:04.870
What kind of mother would I be

24:04.871 --> 24:08.454
if I couldn't recognize
my own son's voice?

24:11.089 --> 24:14.345
I'm sorry to bother you like this but...

24:14.346 --> 24:15.679
I need a favor.

24:16.723 --> 24:17.556
Mom?

24:18.414 --> 24:22.497
You didn't even ask about your father.

24:23.843 --> 24:24.926
I'm sorry.

24:27.540 --> 24:29.747
How's he doing, is he alright?

24:29.748 --> 24:31.966
He doesn't know who I am
when I visit him...

24:31.967 --> 24:36.695
Last time he called me Edith
for an hour and a half.

24:36.696 --> 24:38.399
I'm sorry to hear that

24:38.400 --> 24:42.567
but that's actually part of
the reason why I'm calling.

24:44.988 --> 24:47.266
Always the same with you, isn't it?

24:47.267 --> 24:50.267
Only call when you want something.

24:50.268 --> 24:51.685
Want something!

24:53.160 --> 24:53.992
Are you forgetting

24:53.993 --> 24:56.411
who sends a check every
month for Dad's care?

24:56.412 --> 24:57.640
I don't see John rushing
home every month

24:57.641 --> 24:59.511
to give you a check, huh?

24:59.512 --> 25:01.804
That's not fair and you know it...

25:01.805 --> 25:05.019
John doesn't earn enough but
at least he keeps in touch...

25:05.020 --> 25:09.050
And he's been having such
a hard time since, Adam...

25:09.051 --> 25:11.295
Not that you'd know anything about that.

25:11.296 --> 25:12.629
You never call.

25:16.421 --> 25:18.640
I don't wanna talk about John.

25:18.641 --> 25:21.474
Then what do you want?

25:26.515 --> 25:29.728
The trust I set up for dad's home.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.896
What about it?

25:33.822 --> 25:35.267
I need you to transfer all the money

25:35.268 --> 25:37.360
that's still in it back to me.

25:37.361 --> 25:39.511
I can't do that...

25:39.512 --> 25:42.149
They expect the next
payment in a few days

25:42.150 --> 25:42.982
and without that...

25:42.983 --> 25:44.405
I will get it back to you before then

25:44.406 --> 25:45.449
I need that money, mother.

25:45.450 --> 25:46.662
I just need it for a few days.

25:46.663 --> 25:47.495
Fuck...

25:47.496 --> 25:48.821
I will get it back to you before then.

25:48.822 --> 25:49.661
Do you hear me?

25:49.662 --> 25:51.947
I will get it back to you before then.

25:51.948 --> 25:52.780
I need it that money!

25:52.781 --> 25:53.613
Fuck!

25:53.614 --> 25:54.446
I need it now!

25:55.414 --> 25:56.863
Hello?

25:56.864 --> 25:57.859
Shit!

26:00.848 --> 26:02.265
Hello.

26:03.840 --> 26:05.736
Mom, it's me.

26:05.737 --> 26:07.668
I'm sorry for cursing at you.

26:07.669 --> 26:11.244
Well you upset me, son.

26:11.245 --> 26:14.828
I understand that
but please just listen.

26:19.606 --> 26:21.523
I'm in a bad situation.

26:22.425 --> 26:25.008
I don't want to go into details

26:27.470 --> 26:29.553
but I need your help mom.

26:30.808 --> 26:32.641
Okay, More than ever.

26:38.557 --> 26:40.957
What was that account number again?

26:40.958 --> 26:43.211
It's on the deposit slip.

26:51.658 --> 26:53.440
Hey, it's Ryan.

26:53.441 --> 26:55.941
I know, I know, I know, but...

26:57.576 --> 26:59.727
How'd you do that?

26:59.728 --> 27:00.772
Just for her?

27:00.773 --> 27:03.112
Maybe a week or two, that's it.

27:03.113 --> 27:05.248
I was just wondering.

27:05.249 --> 27:07.082
I need that money now.

27:07.922 --> 27:09.005
Yeah, uh huh.

27:13.602 --> 27:15.185
I just need enough.

27:50.016 --> 27:51.208
John?

27:51.209 --> 27:52.860
What's wrong?

27:52.861 --> 27:54.251
You said you could find me.

27:54.252 --> 27:57.085
Nothing's wrong, and
I need you to remain calm.

27:57.086 --> 27:58.836
I can't stay calm.

28:00.396 --> 28:01.259
This guy's gonna kill me

28:01.260 --> 28:04.788
if I don't get him a million dollars.

28:04.789 --> 28:05.621
Forget about the money.

28:05.622 --> 28:06.454
We're right outside.

28:07.288 --> 28:08.205
You are?

28:10.917 --> 28:12.436
Thank God.

28:12.437 --> 28:13.269
We traced the phone signal

28:13.270 --> 28:14.471
just like I said we would...

28:14.472 --> 28:16.630
It's just a shitty warehouse complex.

28:16.631 --> 28:18.068
Just get me out of here...

28:18.069 --> 28:18.968
We're about ready...

28:18.969 --> 28:22.208
We've got a full SWAT team
ready and waiting on a go.

28:22.209 --> 28:23.041
You hear that?

28:23.042 --> 28:24.257
Fuck you!

28:24.258 --> 28:25.167
Ryan?

28:25.168 --> 28:26.379
Ryan!

28:26.380 --> 28:27.903
Don't say another word...

28:27.904 --> 28:28.736
Sit tight...

28:28.737 --> 28:29.569
We're coming for you.

28:29.570 --> 28:30.403
What?

28:31.348 --> 28:32.181
John!

28:33.412 --> 28:34.761
John!

28:34.762 --> 28:36.381
I'm in here!

28:36.382 --> 28:38.541
Can you hear me?

28:44.157 --> 28:45.453
I'm in here!

28:47.193 --> 28:48.045
John?

28:48.046 --> 28:49.617
No, it's me.

28:49.618 --> 28:50.820
I sent the money, are you okay?

28:50.821 --> 28:51.653
I'm okay.

28:51.654 --> 28:54.654
Everything's going to be fine baby.

28:55.782 --> 28:57.507
Can you hear me?

28:57.508 --> 28:58.662
I'm in here!

29:00.677 --> 29:02.070
John?

29:02.071 --> 29:03.866
What's wrong, what's happened?

29:03.867 --> 29:05.438
Everything...

29:05.439 --> 29:09.339
I'm sorry bro, we're in
the wrong location...

29:09.340 --> 29:10.277
The signal from your phone's

29:10.278 --> 29:12.015
been routed to an empty building...

29:12.016 --> 29:13.849
You could be anywhere.

29:16.264 --> 29:18.183
And there's something else.

29:18.184 --> 29:19.131
What?

29:19.132 --> 29:21.299
There was a note.

29:23.127 --> 29:25.358
What does it say?

29:25.359 --> 29:27.526
Just three words.

29:30.280 --> 29:32.247
Read it to me.

29:32.248 --> 29:34.248
It's bad, Ryan.

29:35.680 --> 29:37.430
Just read it to me.

29:38.332 --> 29:39.544
I have them.

29:43.590 --> 29:44.620
Are you there bro?

29:44.621 --> 29:46.083
I'm gonna do everything I can.

29:46.084 --> 29:47.643
I need you to try and remember.

29:47.644 --> 29:50.499
Try and remember who took you.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.574
Any detail from when you
were taken could be help...

29:57.232 --> 30:01.399
Every action has a reaction,
Mister Hinds.

30:07.396 --> 30:08.896
That's not fair.

30:09.914 --> 30:11.247
You're cheating.

30:20.195 --> 30:21.445
please pick up.

30:26.291 --> 30:27.250
Ryan?

30:27.251 --> 30:28.498
Someone is here...

30:28.499 --> 30:29.545
They're trying to get into the house.

30:29.546 --> 30:30.734
Where are you?

30:30.735 --> 30:33.237
I'm in the kitchen.

30:33.238 --> 30:34.147
Where is Larry?

30:34.148 --> 30:36.436
He's still at school.

30:36.437 --> 30:38.296
Listen to me, listen very carefully.

30:38.297 --> 30:39.411
I want you to go upstairs,

30:39.412 --> 30:40.744
I want you to lock
yourself in the bathroom.

30:40.745 --> 30:43.228
The police are on their way.

30:43.229 --> 30:44.451
I'm scared.

30:44.452 --> 30:46.779
They're going to kidnap me too.

30:46.780 --> 30:47.922
Ryan!

30:47.923 --> 30:48.808
Anna?

30:48.809 --> 30:49.641
Anna!

30:51.510 --> 30:52.343
Anna?

31:03.719 --> 31:04.719
Turn it off!

31:05.685 --> 31:07.268
Please turn it off!

31:09.561 --> 31:11.561
Please, it's burning me.

31:14.013 --> 31:16.013
I'll get you your money.

31:37.149 --> 31:38.316
Where is Anna?

31:40.412 --> 31:42.165
Your wife is safe.

31:42.166 --> 31:42.999
For now.

31:44.289 --> 31:46.858
If I get you this money,

31:46.859 --> 31:49.859
how do I know that you'll let us go?

31:50.961 --> 31:52.486
What's the matter, Mister Hinds?

31:52.487 --> 31:54.070
You don't trust me?

31:56.025 --> 31:57.025
Trust you?

32:04.557 --> 32:07.974
You see, I work with
some wealthy people.

32:09.788 --> 32:11.871
They have a lot of money.

32:13.463 --> 32:15.546
I can get it out of them.

32:19.460 --> 32:21.872
But I need more time.

32:21.873 --> 32:25.873
You still have more than enough time.

32:31.330 --> 32:34.243
How much more money do I have to raise?

32:34.244 --> 32:38.327
You're over $900,000 short I'm afraid.

32:43.389 --> 32:44.222
I see.

33:04.411 --> 33:07.328
Ryan, you alright in there buddy?

33:09.654 --> 33:10.904
Alright, sorry.

33:18.257 --> 33:19.950
Touch me.

33:19.951 --> 33:21.987
You know what, I'm sorry.

33:21.988 --> 33:23.155
I'm exhausted.

33:29.804 --> 33:31.845
Well don't mind me.

33:38.257 --> 33:39.831
Hello.

33:39.832 --> 33:40.741
Hey, Bob.

33:40.742 --> 33:42.825
Yeah, who's this?

33:43.946 --> 33:45.469
It's Poppa Hinds.

33:45.470 --> 33:47.185
Ryan?

33:47.186 --> 33:48.457
The one and only.

33:48.458 --> 33:50.281
I Didn't think I was gonna hear from you

33:50.282 --> 33:51.841
until next month buddy.

33:51.842 --> 33:53.513
You got good news for me?

33:53.514 --> 33:55.650
I got better than good news for you Bob.

33:55.651 --> 33:57.829
Let me get my DSL's ready for you

33:57.830 --> 34:01.669
because I am about to make
you a shit ton of money,

34:01.670 --> 34:04.285
but you gotta understand something Bob.

34:04.286 --> 34:05.905
You can not go blabbing your mouth

34:05.906 --> 34:07.429
to your fucking poker buddies.

34:07.430 --> 34:10.154
Have you heard of Morhair?

34:10.155 --> 34:11.701
You ever heard of them?

34:11.702 --> 34:13.359
Yeah, I'm a client.

34:13.360 --> 34:15.554
It's a Hair transplant business.

34:15.554 --> 34:19.045
They have a new restoration system

34:19.045 --> 34:20.677
the they have created right now,

34:20.678 --> 34:23.690
and a little fucking birdie tells me

34:23.690 --> 34:25.940
it is about to be approved.

34:26.896 --> 34:31.333
Bottles or sprays, no
transplant, no surgery.

34:31.333 --> 34:34.476
A Fucking magic pill, and it works.

34:34.478 --> 34:35.844
Full head of hair

34:35.846 --> 34:38.665
pussy in your lap, sitting
on your fucking yacht.

34:38.666 --> 34:41.318
That's why they call it
inside fucking information!

34:41.319 --> 34:43.513
Of course it hasn't been
approved by the FDA.

34:43.514 --> 34:44.976
That's why I'm bringing it to you.

34:44.978 --> 34:48.676
If you wanna wait until
goes and gets FDA approved

34:48.677 --> 34:49.993
and it's on the open market

34:49.994 --> 34:52.384
and the fucking prices skyrocket,

34:52.385 --> 34:55.536
you wanna stand by like every
other fucking moron out there?

34:55.538 --> 34:56.485
Be my guest.

34:56.487 --> 34:57.686
I don't give a shit,

34:57.687 --> 35:00.074
but you're not gonna make the
money I'm talking about Bob.

35:00.075 --> 35:03.908
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,
Bob, what do you say?

35:06.987 --> 35:09.154
You got me, daddy.

35:10.886 --> 35:13.466
That's what I'm fucking talking about.

35:13.467 --> 35:17.246
Alright, I'm gonna need you
to transfer the fund today.

35:17.247 --> 35:18.363
Can you do that?

35:18.364 --> 35:19.196
Shit man!

35:19.197 --> 35:20.317
You need it today?

35:20.318 --> 35:22.898
Yes, if I'm gonna kill it
for you like I'm going to Bob,

35:22.899 --> 35:25.081
I need the money right fucking now.

35:25.082 --> 35:28.309
You're an animal, I like it.

35:28.310 --> 35:31.802
Okay, transfer the funds
to the usual account.

35:31.803 --> 35:33.700
I'll take care of the rest.

35:33.701 --> 35:36.451
No sooner said than done.

35:38.306 --> 35:41.761
A pleasure doing business with you Bob.

36:15.877 --> 36:17.127
Hello.

36:18.037 --> 36:21.480
Hey Ross, Ryan Hinds.

36:21.481 --> 36:23.231
Oh, hi Ryan.

36:24.202 --> 36:28.685
Look, I was just calling
to see how things were going,

36:28.686 --> 36:31.206
see how the family was.

36:31.207 --> 36:34.387
Yeah, we've been doing pretty good.

36:34.388 --> 36:36.628
Kids got tuition.

36:36.629 --> 36:38.814
Did I tell you he was accepted to Yale?

36:38.815 --> 36:40.818
Wow, congratulations.

36:40.819 --> 36:43.518
That's quite an accomplishment.

36:43.519 --> 36:44.851
A chip off the old block.

36:44.852 --> 36:47.322
Hey, can I call you some other time?

36:47.323 --> 36:49.542
You know what, Ross, I just want you

36:49.543 --> 36:51.247
to give me 10 seconds.

36:51.248 --> 36:52.878
Okay, I want you to give me 10 seconds

36:52.879 --> 36:57.331
so that you can hang up knowing
what you're missing out on.

36:57.332 --> 36:59.231
Okay, what do you have?

36:59.232 --> 37:00.232
Thank you.

37:01.138 --> 37:04.052
Now, have you heard of a
company called Seeview?

37:04.053 --> 37:06.797
Yeah, they're the glass manufacturers.

37:06.798 --> 37:08.715
That's exactly right.

37:10.801 --> 37:12.059
What about them?

37:12.060 --> 37:14.748
Last I heard, they were down
about a point and a half.

37:17.821 --> 37:20.580
That's a good thing though Ross, okay?

37:20.581 --> 37:23.243
They're down right now.

37:23.244 --> 37:25.210
But what nobody knows,

37:25.211 --> 37:29.655
is they are developing a
brand new bullet proof plastic

37:29.656 --> 37:31.907
that's going to launch in November.

37:31.908 --> 37:34.163
Bulletproof glass?

37:34.164 --> 37:35.736
So what's new about that?

37:35.737 --> 37:38.617
It is new Ross, it is new, very new.

37:38.618 --> 37:41.368
Okay, what's on the market now is

37:42.209 --> 37:44.126
bullet resistant glass.

37:46.331 --> 37:47.885
See the difference?

37:47.886 --> 37:48.718
Okay?

37:48.719 --> 37:49.661
It's only bullet resistant.

37:49.662 --> 37:50.986
What Seeview is creating

37:50.987 --> 37:53.904
is 100% bonafide bullet proof.

37:54.768 --> 37:56.518
That's special, okay?

37:57.793 --> 38:01.155
That's something that can
make you money and save lives.

38:01.156 --> 38:03.527
Okay, I can see
how it's gonna save lives,

38:03.528 --> 38:06.679
but how's is it gonna make me money?

38:06.680 --> 38:08.311
Very good question.

38:08.312 --> 38:11.023
That's a very good question
and I have a very good answer.

38:11.024 --> 38:13.459
You see, right now Seeview
is negotiating a deal

38:13.460 --> 38:15.139
with the United States military

38:15.140 --> 38:17.193
to retrofit all of their vehicles

38:17.194 --> 38:20.588
from here to Afghanistan with
their new bulletproof glass!

38:20.589 --> 38:21.422
Okay?

38:22.688 --> 38:23.520
That's huge...

38:23.521 --> 38:24.353
Yeah.

38:24.354 --> 38:25.651
Yeah Ross, that's huge.

38:25.652 --> 38:29.229
That's why I'm calling all
of my most important clients,

38:29.230 --> 38:30.063
okay?

38:30.974 --> 38:33.362
Hey, let me ask you a question,

38:33.363 --> 38:37.030
because this stock is
gonna triple in value.

38:38.173 --> 38:43.043
How much equity did you
pull out of that mortgage?

38:43.044 --> 38:44.963
I had to pull out $200,000.

38:44.964 --> 38:45.797
Well...

38:47.772 --> 38:51.939
Imagine what $200,000
could do in just a few days.

38:53.029 --> 38:54.446
In days?

38:55.442 --> 38:56.859
Triple in days.

39:00.553 --> 39:01.968
I don't know Ryan.

39:01.969 --> 39:04.080
It sound too good of a deal.

39:04.081 --> 39:05.593
I could lose my house here,

39:05.594 --> 39:07.440
I could lose everything.

39:07.441 --> 39:11.041
$200,000 is everything I have right now.

39:11.042 --> 39:12.264
It's my whole nest egg.

39:12.265 --> 39:14.265
Ross, I never do this,

39:16.080 --> 39:18.870
but I feel so strongly
about this investment

39:18.871 --> 39:22.454
that I am going to
guarantee you personally

39:23.488 --> 39:25.576
that you are not gonna lose a penny.

39:25.577 --> 39:26.410
Okay?

39:27.601 --> 39:30.864
Now I want you to
think about your family.

39:30.865 --> 39:34.561
Yeah, I'm going to have to pass Ryan,

39:34.562 --> 39:37.609
but maybe we can get together next week.

39:40.851 --> 39:41.934
Wait, Ross?

39:48.738 --> 39:50.581
200% return on your initial investment

39:50.582 --> 39:52.285
of $50,000 is unheard of.

39:52.286 --> 39:54.180
That's why I'm calling you.

39:54.181 --> 39:56.532
Look, we can call the management, okay?

39:56.533 --> 39:58.884
Everything says this is
a for sure thing,

39:58.885 --> 40:01.885
and I'm just telling you right now.

40:02.845 --> 40:03.677
Hello?

40:03.678 --> 40:05.184
What do you mean?

40:05.185 --> 40:06.516
When did I lose you money?

40:06.517 --> 40:08.210
Yeah, hello?

40:08.211 --> 40:12.012
May I speak to Mister Dennison please?

40:12.013 --> 40:12.901
Hey, what the fuck?

40:12.902 --> 40:16.848
What won't you take
my calls motherfucker?

40:16.849 --> 40:18.133
I'm gonna get it.

40:18.134 --> 40:19.836
Okay, you have a nice day.

40:19.837 --> 40:20.920
Fuckin' pussy!

40:25.176 --> 40:26.760
That's what I'm fucking telling you!

40:26.761 --> 40:28.283
It is going crazy in here right now,

40:28.284 --> 40:30.853
okay, we are all fucking
high fiving each other!

40:30.854 --> 40:33.804
I swear, to a Jew to another Jew.

40:33.805 --> 40:35.773
I swear on the holy Bible.

40:35.774 --> 40:37.896
I swear on the Qur’an.

40:37.897 --> 40:39.564
I swear on my vault.

40:40.834 --> 40:44.127
I'm sorry, I didn't
realize you were a Mormon.

40:44.128 --> 40:45.461
No, I apologize.

40:48.031 --> 40:49.470
That's what I'm fucking talking about!

40:49.471 --> 40:50.304
$846,000!

40:52.795 --> 40:55.986
Your fucking money is coming, you happy?

40:55.987 --> 40:59.335
Now can you cut me some
fucking slack on the heat?

40:59.336 --> 41:00.918
No, don't put me on hold again, okay?

41:00.919 --> 41:03.486
Don't put me on fucking hold again.

41:03.487 --> 41:04.893
Say no to me again.

41:04.894 --> 41:06.679
Say no to me again!

41:06.680 --> 41:07.513
Fuck you!

41:12.511 --> 41:14.178
Ryan, you are funny.

41:15.127 --> 41:15.960
You're in?

41:18.963 --> 41:20.667
My secretary's gonna
send you the confirmation

41:20.668 --> 41:21.501
right now.

41:24.376 --> 41:25.543
Locking it in.

41:26.894 --> 41:30.305
You are my most important client.

41:30.306 --> 41:31.139
Hello?

41:33.338 --> 41:34.480
I have a hundred other clients

41:34.481 --> 41:36.173
that I should be calling right now,

41:36.174 --> 41:37.264
but I am talking to you,

41:37.265 --> 41:38.945
because I want you to make this deal.

41:38.946 --> 41:41.279
This is a good fucking deal.

41:44.141 --> 41:44.974
See?

41:56.052 --> 41:58.885
I'm doing this professionally now.

42:03.286 --> 42:04.119
Come on.

42:08.794 --> 42:10.377
What does that say?

42:13.222 --> 42:14.305
That's not...

42:16.834 --> 42:17.667
Hey!

44:06.114 --> 44:09.149
Ryan, how're you holding up?

44:09.150 --> 44:10.777
I'm being roasted
like a fuckin' pig, John.

44:10.778 --> 44:12.527
How do you think I am?

44:12.528 --> 44:15.540
Hopefully we will have you
out of there soon man.

44:15.541 --> 44:17.308
We got a hold of the cell phone company.

44:17.309 --> 44:18.840
We have your location narrowed

44:18.841 --> 44:21.528
to about a fifteen miles radius.

44:21.529 --> 44:25.598
I got guys swarming the
area right now as we speak.

44:25.599 --> 44:26.766
That's nice.

44:30.915 --> 44:32.937
I don't have much time.

44:32.938 --> 44:35.097
Look, stay with me Ryan!

44:35.098 --> 44:37.668
Concentrate, do you remember anything,

44:37.669 --> 44:41.169
anything at all that
can help us find you?

44:43.782 --> 44:46.998
I was checking out of my hotel

44:46.999 --> 44:48.666
and going to my car.

44:55.050 --> 44:57.383
That's when they grabbed me.

44:58.255 --> 45:01.005
That's the last thing I remember.

45:03.607 --> 45:06.190
What did he look like?

45:09.427 --> 45:11.927
He was wearing a mask John.

45:14.838 --> 45:16.505
Maybe it was a mask.

45:17.720 --> 45:18.552
You have to give me

45:18.553 --> 45:21.303
something more to work with Ryan.

45:25.102 --> 45:27.265
John is it possible
that my blood is actually

45:27.266 --> 45:29.516
starting to boil inside me?

45:34.861 --> 45:36.444
I've gotta go John.

46:05.895 --> 46:06.728
What?

46:07.754 --> 46:10.171
Hey Ryan, it's Ross.

46:11.461 --> 46:12.504
Ross Who?

46:12.505 --> 46:16.672
Ross, you know, 2nd mortgage,
son going to Yale.

46:19.070 --> 46:21.024
What do you want?

46:21.025 --> 46:24.038
Well I thought it over.

46:24.039 --> 46:25.525
Thought what over?

46:25.526 --> 46:26.534
Your offer.

46:26.535 --> 46:29.454
Damn you brokers have
a short memory span.

46:29.455 --> 46:30.703
Anyways, I'll do it.

46:30.704 --> 46:31.704
I trust you.

46:36.018 --> 46:37.552
How much?

46:37.553 --> 46:39.234
I'll do the full $200,000.

46:39.235 --> 46:40.652
How's that sound?

46:41.922 --> 46:42.922
How fast?

46:45.126 --> 46:46.734
How fast?

46:46.735 --> 46:49.457
My secretary just made the transfer,

46:49.458 --> 46:52.958
you should be receiving it
any minute now.

47:04.924 --> 47:06.507
Come on, come on.

47:18.776 --> 47:20.425
I did it!

47:20.426 --> 47:21.259
I did it!

47:23.564 --> 47:25.230
One million fifty four thousand

47:25.231 --> 47:29.398
six hundred and thirty two
dollars and three cents.

47:33.655 --> 47:36.155
Now turn off the fucking heat!

47:37.580 --> 47:39.497
In due time.

47:43.796 --> 47:45.796
You gave me your word.

47:48.656 --> 47:50.838
You gave me your word,
now turn off the heat!

47:50.839 --> 47:52.746
I said you had two hours

47:52.747 --> 47:56.580
to transfer one million
dollars of your money.

47:58.029 --> 48:00.186
What is that supposed to mean?

48:00.187 --> 48:02.226
It means you didn't play by the rules

48:02.227 --> 48:05.010
so now the rules have changed.

48:07.389 --> 48:09.248
I got you a million dollars,

48:09.249 --> 48:11.443
now you let us go.

48:11.444 --> 48:12.276
I want you to know

48:12.277 --> 48:15.127
that I'm not a greedy man,
Mister Hinds...

48:15.128 --> 48:16.650
I only asked for a million...

48:16.651 --> 48:19.734
I was going to let you keep the rest.

48:22.474 --> 48:24.455
The rest of what?

48:24.456 --> 48:25.317
You have the money

48:25.318 --> 48:27.225
but you insist on this farce...

48:27.226 --> 48:28.309
This charade.

48:42.022 --> 48:43.629
What are you talking about?

48:43.630 --> 48:45.443
You've done everything in your power

48:45.444 --> 48:47.352
to hold onto it...

48:47.353 --> 48:48.984
You've begged, borrowed and stolen

48:48.985 --> 48:51.985
just so you didn't have to touch it.

48:56.350 --> 48:57.669
Touch what?

48:57.670 --> 48:58.966
The four million dollars

48:58.967 --> 49:01.467
you've put aside for yourself.

49:10.890 --> 49:13.390
How did you know about that?

49:24.875 --> 49:27.435
I have done everything
that you've asked.

49:27.436 --> 49:29.859
Not quite, Mister Hinds...

49:29.860 --> 49:32.548
You've done what you've always done...

49:32.549 --> 49:35.382
Lied your way through a situation.

49:41.178 --> 49:43.871
Give me another chance...

49:43.872 --> 49:46.705
Okay just give me another chance.

49:47.865 --> 49:48.884
I can get money.

49:48.885 --> 49:49.717
I can get you more money, I know.

49:49.718 --> 49:52.051
Just give me another chance.

49:54.839 --> 49:57.741
You do have one last chance.

49:57.742 --> 50:01.033
But I'm afraid the rules have changed.

50:01.034 --> 50:05.201
It looks like you have just
under five minutes remaining.

50:07.778 --> 50:09.050
What?

50:09.051 --> 50:11.558
To transfer all four million dollars

50:11.559 --> 50:13.360
into my account.

50:17.633 --> 50:19.777
That's the account...

50:19.778 --> 50:20.861
Your account.

50:27.595 --> 50:29.512
How did you get this?

50:31.113 --> 50:34.863
The same place I got the password.

50:39.858 --> 50:43.266
If you already knew it
then why would you do this?

50:43.267 --> 50:46.327
I wanted to give you a chance...

50:46.328 --> 50:49.289
A chance to redeem yourself.

50:49.290 --> 50:50.540
But you failed.

50:51.787 --> 50:52.620
No, no!

50:55.860 --> 50:58.693
That money is for my family, okay?

51:02.189 --> 51:03.689
You mother fucker.

51:08.405 --> 51:10.655
We're crippled with debt...

51:12.750 --> 51:14.917
For Anna, for my children.

51:24.305 --> 51:26.138
For Anna, for my kids.

51:31.628 --> 51:32.461
I failed.

51:37.485 --> 51:39.402
I failed at everything.

51:42.006 --> 51:43.506
I failed as a man.

52:07.604 --> 52:09.797
Mister Hinds?

52:09.798 --> 52:11.333
Mister Hinds?

52:11.334 --> 52:12.893
Yes!

52:12.894 --> 52:13.864
Could you please confirm

52:13.865 --> 52:16.877
the password we have on file?

52:16.878 --> 52:18.041
One...

52:18.042 --> 52:18.917
Three...

52:18.918 --> 52:19.948
C...

52:19.949 --> 52:21.116
Three, four...

52:22.493 --> 52:23.326
R.M.X.L.

52:25.985 --> 52:27.856
Thank you, Mister Hinds.

52:27.857 --> 52:30.557
We received your inquiry
to make a delta transaction

52:30.558 --> 52:32.764
of your full account balance.

52:32.765 --> 52:34.025
I would like to make a delta transfer

52:34.026 --> 52:36.066
of the entire account balance.

52:36.067 --> 52:39.558
Yes sir, consider it done.

52:39.559 --> 52:43.596
Looks like we have all the
transfer account information.

52:43.597 --> 52:45.312
Could you please confirm once more

52:45.313 --> 52:47.544
your wish for a delta transaction?

52:47.545 --> 52:48.628
Yes, do it!

55:12.801 --> 55:14.718
You got you your money.

55:17.171 --> 55:19.338
Yes, well done.

55:20.581 --> 55:21.866
I knew you could do it,

55:21.867 --> 55:24.034
given the right incentive.

55:26.195 --> 55:28.195
And now you let me go.

55:29.472 --> 55:31.332
Not yet...

55:31.333 --> 55:34.583
We still have some unfinished business.

55:37.681 --> 55:40.514
I did everything that you asked.

55:42.658 --> 55:46.825
Yes, but did you do it
for the right reasons?

55:53.831 --> 55:57.748
I got your million
dollars now you let me go.

56:17.257 --> 56:20.340
I think it's time we talk.

56:30.143 --> 56:33.154
What could we possibly
have to talk about?

56:33.155 --> 56:36.575
We have plenty to discuss still.

56:36.576 --> 56:39.993
I left you some water,
look to your left.

56:48.144 --> 56:49.144
Slow down...

56:51.011 --> 56:54.344
You're only going to mate yourself sick.

57:28.357 --> 57:30.440
I'm starting to pity you.

57:34.693 --> 57:36.026
Well don't...

57:37.177 --> 57:38.510
I'm doing great.

57:39.565 --> 57:43.732
You don't look great,
far from it in fact.

57:45.053 --> 57:48.720
Well I guess I have
you to thank for that.

57:52.705 --> 57:54.705
Is that what you wanted?

58:17.869 --> 58:19.869
What's wrong?

58:24.501 --> 58:25.918
These names...

58:27.954 --> 58:30.248
They're my family.

58:30.249 --> 58:32.499
Read them aloud.

58:40.002 --> 58:41.454
Anna.

58:41.455 --> 58:43.624
Your beautiful wife.

58:43.625 --> 58:45.542
Who's next on the list?

58:47.875 --> 58:48.953
Larry...

58:48.954 --> 58:50.716
Your son.

58:50.717 --> 58:51.550
Next.

58:54.233 --> 58:56.416
Valerie and Greg.

58:56.417 --> 58:57.726
Mother and father.

58:57.727 --> 58:58.644
Keep going!

59:06.707 --> 59:08.290
You motherfucker.

59:09.187 --> 59:11.270
Read the name!

59:16.757 --> 59:17.590
Leslie.

59:19.554 --> 59:21.721
And who is she?

59:23.694 --> 59:24.944
I'm no saint.

59:25.827 --> 59:28.670
No you're not Mister Hinds.

59:28.671 --> 59:30.671
Who is last on the list?

59:34.916 --> 59:36.745
My brother, John.

59:36.746 --> 59:38.208
These are all the names of people

59:38.209 --> 59:40.042
you care for, correct?

59:43.418 --> 59:44.251
Yes.

59:51.487 --> 59:53.820
You took everything from me.

59:58.013 --> 59:59.096
Everything...

01:00:00.922 --> 01:00:02.368
Are you sure, Ryan...

01:00:02.369 --> 01:00:04.952
Have I really taken everything?

01:00:09.605 --> 01:00:11.438
I think it's for you.

01:00:25.253 --> 01:00:27.401
Ryan, is that you?

01:00:27.402 --> 01:00:28.996
He said I could talk to you.

01:00:28.997 --> 01:00:30.247
Yes it's me.

01:00:34.361 --> 01:00:35.193
Did you see him?

01:00:35.194 --> 01:00:36.929
Did you see his face?

01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:38.140
No...

01:00:38.141 --> 01:00:39.892
I only heard his voice...

01:00:39.893 --> 01:00:40.984
Didn't see him.

01:00:40.985 --> 01:00:42.018
Never saw him.

01:00:42.019 --> 01:00:43.504
I'm scared, honey...

01:00:43.505 --> 01:00:44.873
What's going on?

01:00:44.874 --> 01:00:47.404
I'll explain everything
later, I promise...

01:00:47.405 --> 01:00:50.236
But for now I need you to try
to tell me where you are...

01:00:50.237 --> 01:00:51.893
Describe it to me.

01:00:51.894 --> 01:00:53.692
I'm in a dirty looking room.

01:00:53.693 --> 01:00:55.840
The walls are made of metal.

01:00:55.841 --> 01:00:57.341
It's old, rusty...

01:00:58.181 --> 01:01:01.180
There's a door with a tiny
window but nothing else...

01:01:01.181 --> 01:01:02.044
No!

01:01:02.045 --> 01:01:03.583
And it's warm...

01:01:03.584 --> 01:01:04.480
What is it?

01:01:04.481 --> 01:01:05.564
What's wrong?

01:01:08.350 --> 01:01:11.817
Baby, is there a small window?

01:01:11.818 --> 01:01:14.818
Is it clear enough to see out of it?

01:01:19.505 --> 01:01:20.422
Sweetheart?

01:01:21.977 --> 01:01:22.877
No.

01:01:22.878 --> 01:01:27.487
I can't make out much but
I can see a silhouette...

01:01:27.488 --> 01:01:29.071
I think it's a man.

01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:31.243
That's okay...

01:01:34.015 --> 01:01:35.944
That means you're close...

01:01:35.945 --> 01:01:37.876
Ryan, where am I?

01:01:37.877 --> 01:01:39.797
What the hell is going on?

01:01:39.798 --> 01:01:43.133
Do you want to tell her or shall I?

01:01:43.134 --> 01:01:44.537
Ryan, who's there?

01:01:44.538 --> 01:01:46.038
What does he want?

01:01:49.074 --> 01:01:51.700
I don't know anymore.

01:01:51.701 --> 01:01:53.524
I need you to calm down...

01:01:53.525 --> 01:01:57.400
Things will only be harder
if you get hysterical.

01:01:57.401 --> 01:01:59.008
Who the hell are you?

01:01:59.009 --> 01:02:02.368
Now, that is an excellent question...

01:02:02.369 --> 01:02:06.834
But I'm not sure you're
directing it to the right person.

01:02:06.835 --> 01:02:08.476
What is he talking about?

01:02:08.477 --> 01:02:09.532
Don't listen to him...

01:02:09.533 --> 01:02:10.533
He's insane.

01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:12.502
Go on...

01:02:12.503 --> 01:02:14.370
Tell her what I'm talking about.

01:02:22.290 --> 01:02:26.416
You've got what you
wanted now let her go.

01:02:26.417 --> 01:02:27.249
I can't do that.

01:02:27.250 --> 01:02:31.000
Not yet, not until you
tell her Mister Hinds.

01:02:31.904 --> 01:02:33.845
Why's he doing this to us?

01:02:33.846 --> 01:02:36.001
What did we ever do to him?

01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:39.169
This isn't about you, it's about me.

01:02:41.886 --> 01:02:44.753
If you tell the truth,
I let you both walk away

01:02:44.754 --> 01:02:47.254
into the sunset, hand in hand.

01:02:52.218 --> 01:02:53.909
First question...

01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:55.410
What is your name?

01:02:56.406 --> 01:02:58.701
You already know my name.

01:02:58.702 --> 01:03:01.702
Think of it as a control question.

01:03:07.242 --> 01:03:09.137
Ryan Hinds.

01:03:09.138 --> 01:03:12.089
Is that your only name?

01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:15.701
What kind of question is that?

01:03:15.702 --> 01:03:17.119
Be quiet, Anna.

01:03:19.024 --> 01:03:22.380
Answer the question.

01:03:22.381 --> 01:03:23.213
Yes!

01:03:23.214 --> 01:03:24.444
It's my only name.

01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:36.605
Okay, okay...

01:03:36.606 --> 01:03:37.889
It's not my only name.

01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:40.997
What the hell are you talking about?

01:03:40.998 --> 01:03:43.150
How many other names, Ryan?

01:03:43.151 --> 01:03:44.568
I don't know...

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:47.192
Take a guess...

01:03:47.193 --> 01:03:48.869
A ballpark figure.

01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:50.382
Four, five...

01:03:50.383 --> 01:03:52.109
Maybe more.

01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:53.375
Another lie.

01:03:53.376 --> 01:03:54.426
It's hot in here...

01:03:54.427 --> 01:03:55.637
The walls are hot...

01:03:55.638 --> 01:03:56.971
What's going on?

01:04:01.639 --> 01:04:04.241
Please don't do this to her...

01:04:04.242 --> 01:04:08.246
I'm not doing this, you are...

01:04:08.247 --> 01:04:09.483
How many other names?

01:04:09.484 --> 01:04:10.901
How many aliases?

01:04:13.574 --> 01:04:14.491
Dozens...

01:04:15.504 --> 01:04:16.921
There are dozens!

01:04:17.930 --> 01:04:20.003
Now we're getting somewhere.

01:04:20.004 --> 01:04:21.085
I don't like this...

01:04:21.086 --> 01:04:22.129
I want to go home now...

01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:24.048
Please take me home.

01:04:24.049 --> 01:04:28.551
It's all be over soon Anna,
I promise just trust me.

01:04:28.552 --> 01:04:30.735
And why should she trust you?

01:04:30.736 --> 01:04:33.734
Why should she trust a liar?

01:04:33.735 --> 01:04:36.317
Tell him you're not lying.

01:04:36.318 --> 01:04:37.572
Question two...

01:04:37.573 --> 01:04:40.619
What do you do for a living?

01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:42.120
I'm a broker...

01:04:43.656 --> 01:04:45.468
It's so hot...

01:04:45.469 --> 01:04:47.221
I'm burning up.

01:04:47.222 --> 01:04:50.041
What do you do for a living?

01:04:50.042 --> 01:04:52.248
So hard to breathe...

01:04:52.249 --> 01:04:54.263
I get people to invest!

01:04:54.264 --> 01:04:56.495
What do you want me to say?

01:04:56.496 --> 01:04:58.476
In what?

01:04:58.477 --> 01:05:00.383
Just tell him...

01:05:00.384 --> 01:05:01.644
Make this stop.

01:05:01.645 --> 01:05:02.895
I don't know.

01:05:04.045 --> 01:05:05.859
It just depends.

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:08.558
I don't know what you want me to say!

01:05:08.559 --> 01:05:10.319
The temperature in Anna's room

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.733
is now 131 degrees.

01:05:12.734 --> 01:05:15.587
What do you get them to invest in?

01:05:15.588 --> 01:05:17.364
I don't want to die in here...

01:05:17.365 --> 01:05:18.244
Tell him.

01:05:18.245 --> 01:05:20.412
Whatever I tell them to!

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:26.043
And what happens after they invest?

01:05:27.728 --> 01:05:29.061
Ryan...

01:05:30.579 --> 01:05:31.619
Ryan?

01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:32.703
Anna, Anna!

01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:36.103
Oh my God.

01:05:38.294 --> 01:05:40.839
Why are you doing this to her?

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:42.011
She's your wife...

01:05:42.012 --> 01:05:44.232
She deserves the truth.

01:05:44.233 --> 01:05:46.429
She didn't know.

01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:47.472
What about Leslie?

01:05:47.473 --> 01:05:50.390
What does she have to do with this?

01:05:52.408 --> 01:05:53.241
What?

01:05:55.908 --> 01:05:58.056
Look around the room.

01:05:58.057 --> 01:06:00.390
I left another gift for you.

01:06:08.268 --> 01:06:09.307
What the hell is that?

01:06:10.204 --> 01:06:12.787
Like I said, a gift.

01:06:58.958 --> 01:07:00.291
What the fuck?

01:07:08.291 --> 01:07:10.208
What the fuck is this?

01:07:45.047 --> 01:07:46.883
Ryan...

01:07:46.884 --> 01:07:47.717
Ryan?

01:07:56.087 --> 01:07:57.262
Leslie?

01:07:57.263 --> 01:08:00.680
Oh, my God is that really you?

01:08:02.064 --> 01:08:03.969
Yeah, it's me.

01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:05.927
They took my finger...

01:08:05.928 --> 01:08:08.508
They cut it off with a knife...

01:08:08.509 --> 01:08:11.146
Maybe you can tell Leslie the truth.

01:08:11.147 --> 01:08:12.430
What truth?

01:08:12.431 --> 01:08:14.556
What the fuck is going on...

01:08:14.557 --> 01:08:17.374
Why is it so hot in here?

01:08:17.375 --> 01:08:18.720
She has a point...

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:19.810
What is the truth?

01:08:19.812 --> 01:08:21.895
Do you even know anymore?

01:08:26.513 --> 01:08:28.013
I know who I am.

01:08:30.313 --> 01:08:33.743
I know what I do and I live with it.

01:08:33.743 --> 01:08:36.118
And what about Leslie?

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:37.487
What about Anna?

01:08:37.488 --> 01:08:38.988
They need to know.

01:08:39.883 --> 01:08:40.932
Anna?

01:08:40.933 --> 01:08:42.203
Who is Anna?

01:08:42.203 --> 01:08:45.036
What does she need to know?

01:08:45.037 --> 01:08:46.113
Tell her...

01:08:46.113 --> 01:08:47.781
Answer the question.

01:08:50.886 --> 01:08:51.970
Anna is...

01:08:53.548 --> 01:08:55.527
Anna is my wife.

01:08:55.528 --> 01:08:57.232
I'm your wife.

01:08:57.233 --> 01:08:59.618
What the hell does she mean...

01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:00.904
Your wife?

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:01.737
Who is that?

01:09:01.738 --> 01:09:02.738
Who is Anna?

01:09:04.041 --> 01:09:04.872
I thought the situation

01:09:04.874 --> 01:09:07.455
deserved a conference call.

01:09:07.456 --> 01:09:08.895
Talk to me Ryan!

01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:10.167
I'm your wife...

01:09:10.169 --> 01:09:11.223
Who is this bitch?

01:09:11.224 --> 01:09:12.640
Leslie shut up!

01:09:14.488 --> 01:09:18.656
It looks like you have
some explaining to do.

01:09:24.089 --> 01:09:25.756
Anna is my wife...

01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:31.916
You both are.

01:09:38.968 --> 01:09:40.718
I lied to you Leslie.

01:09:43.911 --> 01:09:45.770
I didn't really care about you.

01:09:45.770 --> 01:09:47.854
I just wanted your money.

01:09:51.901 --> 01:09:53.484
I lied to you both.

01:09:55.069 --> 01:09:57.648
I've lied to everyone.

01:09:57.649 --> 01:09:58.481
I've lied to everyone I've ever met...

01:09:58.482 --> 01:10:00.232
It's what I do but...

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:07.681
I saw opportunities and I took them...

01:10:07.682 --> 01:10:10.839
Rich women, bankers,
private investors...

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.000
I told them what they wanted to hear

01:10:12.001 --> 01:10:13.918
and I took their money.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:23.140
Leslie, I'm sorry I did that to you.

01:10:23.141 --> 01:10:23.974
Anna.

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.073
Anna?

01:10:28.756 --> 01:10:30.589
Anna, can you hear me?

01:10:33.077 --> 01:10:33.910
Please...

01:10:36.393 --> 01:10:40.560
You have to know, you have to
know, you have to know that...

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:47.210
Anna, I'm so sorry...

01:10:54.821 --> 01:10:55.988
Please answer.

01:10:59.261 --> 01:11:02.594
I never lied about how I felt about you.

01:11:03.688 --> 01:11:05.537
I love you so much.

01:11:05.538 --> 01:11:06.788
I love our son.

01:11:10.785 --> 01:11:12.315
Please believe me.

01:11:12.316 --> 01:11:15.649
Please don't think I'm lying about that.

01:11:18.808 --> 01:11:21.225
How very touching.

01:11:22.710 --> 01:11:24.293
Just let them go.

01:11:32.946 --> 01:11:35.779
Ryan, Ryan, are you okay?

01:11:38.562 --> 01:11:40.479
No, it's almost over.

01:11:44.537 --> 01:11:46.620
It's almost done and I...

01:11:51.822 --> 01:11:53.989
I want you to know that...

01:11:56.669 --> 01:11:59.885
I'm sorry I wasn't the
brother I should have been.

01:11:59.886 --> 01:12:02.681
Don't talk like that,

01:12:02.682 --> 01:12:05.357
we've got a lead from
the cell phone company.

01:12:05.358 --> 01:12:06.663
We've triangulated your position.

01:12:06.664 --> 01:12:10.831
We'll be there in fifteen
minutes, just hang in there man.

01:12:15.582 --> 01:12:17.915
It doesn't matter anymore.

01:12:21.017 --> 01:12:21.850
I'm sorry.

01:12:23.981 --> 01:12:25.064
Ryan.

01:12:36.592 --> 01:12:38.005
I want you to pull out the gun

01:12:38.006 --> 01:12:40.506
from the box in front of you.

01:13:07.547 --> 01:13:10.547
Shoot yourself and I'll let them go.

01:13:15.204 --> 01:13:16.287
It ends here.

01:13:22.039 --> 01:13:25.858
Or, you tell me you'd rather them die,

01:13:25.859 --> 01:13:29.359
and I'll open that door
for you right now.

01:13:31.402 --> 01:13:33.819
All you have to do is choose.

01:13:45.167 --> 01:13:47.250
Please know I am sorry.

01:13:50.123 --> 01:13:51.662
Do it.

01:13:51.663 --> 01:13:52.830
Fucking do it.

01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:28.750
Ryan, thank God!

01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:33.367
It's okay, Ryan...

01:15:33.368 --> 01:15:34.935
It's all over.

01:15:41.124 --> 01:15:41.957
No.

01:15:43.742 --> 01:15:45.909
No, you were too far away.

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:02.593
Why?

01:16:14.808 --> 01:16:17.959
You're my brother,
how could you do this?

01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:19.051
Do what?

01:16:19.052 --> 01:16:19.884
How could I take something

01:16:19.885 --> 01:16:23.635
that didn't belong to
you in the first place?

01:16:26.047 --> 01:16:27.630
I never hurt you.

01:16:30.148 --> 01:16:31.241
Is that so?

01:16:31.242 --> 01:16:32.825
Not like this...

01:16:36.413 --> 01:16:38.330
Do you remember Adam?

01:16:41.123 --> 01:16:43.456
Of course I remember Adam.

01:16:45.052 --> 01:16:46.759
Jesus Christ,
I'm sorry you lost your son.

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:49.491
What the fuck does that
have to do with this?

01:16:49.492 --> 01:16:52.737
When was the last time you called him?

01:16:52.738 --> 01:16:54.488
Can you tell me that?

01:16:57.008 --> 01:16:57.973
Ryan?

01:16:57.974 --> 01:16:58.891
Come on...

01:16:59.755 --> 01:17:01.172
Was it Christmas?

01:17:03.186 --> 01:17:04.903
I don't remember.

01:17:04.904 --> 01:17:06.608
Was it his birthday?

01:17:06.609 --> 01:17:08.192
He was your nephew.

01:17:12.556 --> 01:17:14.022
I don't know.

01:17:14.023 --> 01:17:16.361
You don't know because you never did...

01:17:16.362 --> 01:17:17.195
Not once.

01:17:23.963 --> 01:17:24.957
Last summer...

01:17:24.958 --> 01:17:28.375
I asked you to meet me
at Margie's Diner.

01:17:33.736 --> 01:17:35.236
Yeah I remember.

01:17:37.502 --> 01:17:39.669
And do you remember why?

01:17:40.695 --> 01:17:42.612
You needed a favor.

01:17:42.613 --> 01:17:44.603
That's right...

01:17:44.604 --> 01:17:47.595
I was asking for your help...

01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:49.036
Now do you remember what I asked for?

01:17:49.037 --> 01:17:51.120
Or does that escaped you?

01:17:55.978 --> 01:17:56.810
A loan?

01:17:56.811 --> 01:17:58.311
You wanted a loan.

01:18:00.086 --> 01:18:03.836
Now do you remember
what that loan was for?

01:18:09.647 --> 01:18:11.147
I don't know...

01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:14.317
You didn't ask.

01:18:18.341 --> 01:18:21.371
You just turned me down flat...

01:18:21.372 --> 01:18:24.128
You said times were
hard for you and Anna...

01:18:24.129 --> 01:18:27.390
But you didn't bother to ask
what times were like for me.

01:18:27.391 --> 01:18:28.974
Times were hard.

01:18:31.815 --> 01:18:33.482
It was for Adam...

01:18:35.932 --> 01:18:37.932
The money was for him...

01:18:39.151 --> 01:18:42.642
The cancer was eating my
son from the inside...

01:18:42.643 --> 01:18:44.134
My insurance wouldn't pay for

01:18:44.135 --> 01:18:48.222
the only treatment that
would have cured him...

01:18:48.223 --> 01:18:51.653
Why the fuck didn't
you just tell me that?

01:18:51.654 --> 01:18:54.654
My son was dying slowly every day.

01:18:56.766 --> 01:18:58.346
I couldn't find the words.

01:18:58.347 --> 01:19:01.097
I just needed you to understand.

01:19:01.944 --> 01:19:04.086
I forgave you at first...

01:19:04.087 --> 01:19:07.628
You couldn't help me
and I accepted that...

01:19:07.629 --> 01:19:11.462
But when I found out
just how rich you were...

01:19:13.297 --> 01:19:17.076
So how did you find out about the money?

01:19:17.077 --> 01:19:20.199
About six months ago I got a call...

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:23.475
Some rich broad had
reported a break in...

01:19:23.476 --> 01:19:25.547
You might recognize the address.

01:19:25.548 --> 01:19:26.631
225 Richmond.

01:19:29.537 --> 01:19:30.952
Leslie.

01:19:30.953 --> 01:19:32.453
Yeah, Leslie...

01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:35.740
Can you imagine my surprise

01:19:35.741 --> 01:19:38.021
when I walked in there and
saw the wedding pictures

01:19:38.022 --> 01:19:39.534
on the mantle piece?

01:19:39.535 --> 01:19:43.511
You and her arm in arm
and all happy and shit.

01:19:43.512 --> 01:19:45.245
I remember your wedding.

01:19:45.246 --> 01:19:49.472
I was there and it wasn't
some rich bitch.

01:19:49.473 --> 01:19:54.083
You should have come
to me when you found out.

01:19:54.084 --> 01:19:55.383
Why?

01:19:55.384 --> 01:20:00.103
Adam was already dead and
I was so pissed at you...

01:20:00.104 --> 01:20:03.937
And you think that,
that makes this alright?

01:20:06.346 --> 01:20:07.659
Oh fuck John.

01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:09.395
You killed people.

01:20:09.396 --> 01:20:10.813
Anna, and Bruce.

01:20:12.671 --> 01:20:15.288
I didn't kill anybody.

01:20:15.289 --> 01:20:18.257
You heard what I wanted you to hear.

01:20:18.258 --> 01:20:22.540
Your buddy Bruce did
exactly what I asked him to,

01:20:22.541 --> 01:20:25.165
and didn't even take much persuading.

01:20:25.166 --> 01:20:26.424
You see, he's just like you.

01:20:26.425 --> 01:20:27.988
He's all about the money.

01:20:27.989 --> 01:20:29.920
You didn't kill him?

01:20:29.921 --> 01:20:32.425
I'm not a murderer Ryan.

01:20:32.426 --> 01:20:36.426
But I did see an opportunity
like you, I took it.

01:20:36.427 --> 01:20:37.260
Mom?

01:20:38.737 --> 01:20:41.411
Was she a part of this?

01:20:41.412 --> 01:20:42.245
Nah.

01:20:43.527 --> 01:20:44.694
No, she's not.

01:20:45.906 --> 01:20:48.239
That was just mom being mom.

01:20:52.331 --> 01:20:54.042
What about Anna?

01:20:54.043 --> 01:20:56.774
I heard them screaming...

01:21:08.282 --> 01:21:11.710
You heard what we wanted you to hear.

01:21:11.711 --> 01:21:15.492
I went to Anna and I showed
her the wedding pictures.

01:21:15.493 --> 01:21:17.827
And then they came to me

01:21:17.828 --> 01:21:21.959
and told me what a lying
sack of shit you were.

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:24.099
John did some digging
and it wasn't long until we

01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:27.100
figured out how far your lies went.

01:21:28.086 --> 01:21:29.856
You'd hurt us all in different ways.

01:21:29.857 --> 01:21:32.357
We just wanted to see you pay.

01:21:35.517 --> 01:21:37.100
Wanted me to pay?

01:21:38.024 --> 01:21:39.940
We needed you to confess...

01:21:39.941 --> 01:21:43.216
We had to hear you admit betraying us.

01:21:43.217 --> 01:21:44.197
We needed to teach you a lesson

01:21:44.198 --> 01:21:47.266
that would change your life...

01:21:47.267 --> 01:21:49.800
Let you feel what we've all felt inside.

01:21:49.801 --> 01:21:51.814
And don't forget the money...

01:21:51.815 --> 01:21:53.815
We all wanted the money.

01:21:55.258 --> 01:21:56.175
Fuck you.

01:21:57.708 --> 01:21:58.883
Fuck all of you.

01:21:58.884 --> 01:22:00.424
I just need to know one thing.

01:22:02.630 --> 01:22:03.963
Did you mean it?

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:08.255
Did I mean what?

01:22:09.667 --> 01:22:11.975
You said you were sorry.

01:22:11.976 --> 01:22:13.309
Did you mean it?

01:22:18.239 --> 01:22:20.239
You said you loved me.

01:22:22.872 --> 01:22:24.789
With all of my heart.

01:22:46.658 --> 01:22:48.532
You were ready to die for me?

01:22:52.735 --> 01:22:54.985
What the fuck did you do?

01:22:57.233 --> 01:22:59.004
Oh Jesus Christ.

01:23:46.082 --> 01:23:47.165
What is it?

01:23:49.443 --> 01:23:50.868
It's leaving the account.

01:23:50.869 --> 01:23:52.869
What have you done Ryan?

01:23:59.206 --> 01:24:03.373
Did you really think you
could swindle a swindler?

01:24:05.612 --> 01:24:06.779
You knew...

01:24:07.979 --> 01:24:11.562
You knew it was us from
the very beginning.

01:24:12.612 --> 01:24:14.702
Well maybe not from
the very beginning...

01:24:14.703 --> 01:24:16.408
He's lying.

01:24:16.409 --> 01:24:17.242
Am I?

01:24:18.213 --> 01:24:21.130
He's just trying to fuck with us.

01:24:22.095 --> 01:24:24.006
Now where's my money?

01:24:35.698 --> 01:24:39.619
I guess it's just you and me now John.

01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:43.120
Anna was the first mistake
that I noticed.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.192
Listen to me, listen very carefully.

01:24:52.193 --> 01:24:53.025
I want you to go upstairs,

01:24:53.026 --> 01:24:53.870
I want you to lock
yourself in the bathroom.

01:24:53.871 --> 01:24:55.084
The police are on their way.

01:24:55.085 --> 01:24:56.247
I'm scared.

01:24:56.248 --> 01:24:58.758
They're going to kidnap me too.

01:24:58.759 --> 01:25:02.342
I never told her that
I'd been kidnapped,

01:25:04.876 --> 01:25:06.793
but it got me thinking.

01:25:10.225 --> 01:25:13.975
First rule when you're
conning somebody John,

01:25:15.421 --> 01:25:17.671
it's all about the details,

01:25:20.977 --> 01:25:22.111
and then there was the watch.

01:25:25.401 --> 01:25:29.318
You were always jealous
that dad gave it to me,

01:25:32.736 --> 01:25:34.653
and last but not least,

01:25:37.333 --> 01:25:39.083
there was the finger.

01:25:43.001 --> 01:25:44.751
It was Leslie's ring.

01:25:45.618 --> 01:25:47.815
It wasn't her finger.

01:25:47.816 --> 01:25:50.041
How could you know that?

01:25:50.042 --> 01:25:51.959
Like I said, details.

01:25:57.001 --> 01:25:59.605
What did you do with the money?

01:25:59.606 --> 01:26:02.439
How are we even fucking related?

01:26:07.054 --> 01:26:08.971
A Delta transfer, John?

01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.047
It's bullshit.

01:26:14.925 --> 01:26:17.907
It's security exercise...

01:26:17.908 --> 01:26:18.740
The money's gone for an hour,

01:26:18.741 --> 01:26:23.548
then they transfers it right
back into the original account.

01:26:23.549 --> 01:26:25.049
You seem confused.

01:26:26.516 --> 01:26:29.665
So let me make it very clear.

01:26:29.666 --> 01:26:32.666
You are not getting a fucking penny.

01:26:39.214 --> 01:26:42.631
How did you know the gun wasn't loaded?

01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:44.557
I didn't.

01:26:46.819 --> 01:26:47.819
I love Anna.

01:26:50.585 --> 01:26:51.752
I always have.

01:26:54.814 --> 01:26:56.443
If I was wrong about all this,

01:26:56.444 --> 01:26:58.361
I couldn't let her die.

01:26:59.951 --> 01:27:03.201
And if I was right I didn't wanna live.

01:27:07.083 --> 01:27:09.330
Help me clean all of this up.

01:27:09.331 --> 01:27:12.368
And we'll just walk right out of here

01:27:12.369 --> 01:27:16.536
and continue our lives like
none of this ever happened.

01:27:51.661 --> 01:27:53.199
Ryan!

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:54.033
Ryan!

01:27:55.822 --> 01:27:57.405
Okay, okay you win.

01:27:59.417 --> 01:28:01.500
You win Ryan, let me out!

01:28:03.562 --> 01:28:05.479
There are no winners.

01:28:07.542 --> 01:28:08.709
Ryan!
