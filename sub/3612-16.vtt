00:02.003 --> 00:03.163
Previously on Lost:

00:03.254 --> 00:06.872
You remember that bamboo field
you woke up in when you first got here?

00:06.966 --> 00:10.299
Beyond that field, across a ridge,
is the heart of the island.

00:10.386 --> 00:12.923
That's where the light is.
That's where he's trying to go.

00:13.014 --> 00:14.550
And that's what you have to protect.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.596
How long am I gonna have
to do this job?

00:16.684 --> 00:19.517
As long as you can.
Drink this.

00:21.063 --> 00:22.974
Now you're like me.

00:24.442 --> 00:28.276
- This is the well I threw Desmond into.
- Looks like someone helped him out.

00:28.362 --> 00:31.650
No, Ben. Someone helped me out.
I'm gonna find Desmond.

00:31.741 --> 00:35.484
And when I do,
I'm gonna destroy the island.

00:44.337 --> 00:47.545
Good afternoon.
And how are you doing today?

00:47.632 --> 00:48.963
Terrific.

00:49.300 --> 00:50.881
I think it's time to leave.

00:53.262 --> 00:57.301
You're with him, and you're with me.
We... are going to a concert.

00:58.684 --> 00:59.719
Let's go.

03:41.263 --> 03:44.096
- Do you need somebody to sign for that?
- You work here?

03:45.476 --> 03:48.263
- I do indeed, brother.
- You a priest or somethin'?

03:50.481 --> 03:51.687
Or something.

03:54.652 --> 03:56.608
Do you mind taking it
around the back there?

03:56.695 --> 03:58.560
Yeah, sure. You got it.

04:08.958 --> 04:11.449
Just around there. Thank you.

04:23.514 --> 04:24.845
Who died?

04:26.642 --> 04:28.633
A man named Christian Shephard.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.933
"Christian Shephard"?
Seriously?

04:35.943 --> 04:37.274
Seriously.

04:39.530 --> 04:40.986
Friend of yours?

04:42.616 --> 04:45.323
- Not exactly.
- Hang on a second.

04:45.411 --> 04:48.323
You bust me out of jail
and make me put on this dress

04:48.414 --> 04:50.279
so that we can go to some concert,

04:50.374 --> 04:52.615
and you won't even tell me
why we're here?

04:52.710 --> 04:55.873
No one can tell you
why you're here, Kate.

04:56.839 --> 04:58.249
Certainly not me.

04:58.340 --> 05:01.548
- You're the one who brought me here.
- I'm not talking about the church.

05:03.888 --> 05:05.719
I'm talking about here.

05:07.266 --> 05:08.346
Who are you?

05:10.269 --> 05:13.807
- What do you want?
- My name is Desmond Hume.

05:13.898 --> 05:17.607
And even though you don't
realize it, I'm your friend.

05:18.903 --> 05:20.234
And as for what I want...

05:23.491 --> 05:24.606
...I want to leave.

05:27.661 --> 05:31.700
Leave and go where?

05:33.209 --> 05:34.574
Let me show you.

06:04.949 --> 06:06.359
You OK?

06:09.036 --> 06:12.153
Yeah. You?

06:13.207 --> 06:16.324
Well, to be honest, doc,
I'm kinda wondering

06:16.418 --> 06:18.204
what the hell just happened up here.

06:19.755 --> 06:21.620
That makes two of us.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.254
So you're the new Jacob, huh?

06:28.681 --> 06:29.761
Feel any different?

06:31.517 --> 06:32.973
Not really.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.552
Well, doc, how about you
come down off the mountaintop

06:36.647 --> 06:39.684
and tell us what the hell
the burning bush had to say for itself?

06:41.277 --> 06:45.190
Jacob told me that we have to go to
the bamboo forest out past our old camp.

06:46.073 --> 06:49.531
Just past it, well, he said I'd find
the place that we need to protect.

06:49.618 --> 06:52.234
This place, what is it?

06:52.329 --> 06:54.320
He called it
the heart of the island.

06:54.415 --> 06:56.201
All he said was that it's...

06:56.834 --> 06:58.324
...it's a light.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.916
And that Locke smoke thing
wants to put it out?

07:03.549 --> 07:06.336
- Something like that, yeah.
- So what if he does?

07:07.970 --> 07:09.551
Then that's it for all of us.

07:11.765 --> 07:15.257
But... But if Locke wants to
put it out, then why hasn't he?

07:15.352 --> 07:16.728
'Cause he ain't got what he needs.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.516
I'm guessing that'd be Desmond.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.686
That's where we were headed
before your inauguration.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.109
Sayid said Locke tossed him in a well.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.107
Jacob didn't say anything to me
about Desmond.

07:28.198 --> 07:30.109
Doesn't sound like he said
anything about anything.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.282
That's kinda true, dude.
He's worse than Yoda.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.825
All right, y'all head
to your heart of the island,

07:36.915 --> 07:39.782
and I'll go get the magic leprechaun
out of that well.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.708
If we leave a trail,
can you catch up with us?

07:42.671 --> 07:44.787
- Hell, yeah, I can.
- Then be safe.

07:46.425 --> 07:48.882
I'd ask you along,
but that'd take all the fun out of me

07:48.969 --> 07:50.300
telling you you can't come.

07:50.387 --> 07:53.470
I guess I'll just have to resist
the urge to follow you anyway.

07:59.021 --> 08:01.353
I got a bad feeling about this.

08:46.110 --> 08:48.021
I don't know why
you got me out of prison,

08:48.112 --> 08:50.353
what you want or who you are,
but you understand,

08:50.447 --> 08:52.938
- I can't be held responsible for...
- Yeah, whatever, dude.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.114
None of this is ringing a bell, is it?

08:59.164 --> 09:02.873
- You, me... tranquilizer gun?
- You are insane.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.748
OK. Fine. l'm insane.
Just wait here.

09:06.839 --> 09:07.828
What if i don't?

09:08.632 --> 09:10.793
Then that's your choice.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.421
But if you stick with me...

09:14.888 --> 09:16.879
...you'll be happy you did.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.018
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.318
"Do Not Disturb" sign.

09:40.789 --> 09:41.824
Who are you?

09:43.500 --> 09:45.286
Why you grinnin' like a sodding idiot?

09:47.045 --> 09:51.004
You have a concert to perform tonight,
and I'm here to pick you up.

09:52.050 --> 09:54.336
Didn't I make it clear
to Widmore's other monkey?

09:54.428 --> 09:58.091
- I don't care about a sodding concert.
- Charlie...

09:59.183 --> 10:04.303
Charlie, what if i told you that...
playing this show is

10:04.396 --> 10:08.605
the most important thing
you'll ever do?

10:09.526 --> 10:10.606
Would you come then?

10:12.988 --> 10:14.068
Sod off.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.240
OK, dude. Sorry about this.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.214
What was that?

10:39.890 --> 10:41.471
That was Charlie.

10:47.773 --> 10:49.638
Why did you take the job, Jack?

10:51.401 --> 10:52.857
Because I was supposed to.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.729
Why? Because some stranger
wrote our names on a wall?

10:58.283 --> 11:00.569
I took it because the island's
all I've got left.

11:01.578 --> 11:04.240
It's the only thing in my life
I haven't managed to ruin.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.663
You haven't ruined anything.

11:07.876 --> 11:10.538
Nothing is irreversible.

11:11.672 --> 11:14.664
This would be so sweet
if we weren't all about to die.

11:32.776 --> 11:35.142
As long as you're watching,
why don't you join us?

11:44.121 --> 11:45.657
What are you doing here, James?

11:46.290 --> 11:49.407
I heard Desmond fell in the well,
so I came to help him get out.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.458
Looks like somebody
beat us both to the punch.

11:55.924 --> 11:58.916
- Oh, well.
- Do you know why I'm here?

11:59.011 --> 12:01.718
I'm guessing you need Desmond
to destroy the island.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.012
That's absolutely right.

12:05.601 --> 12:08.058
Then what, Smokey?
You going down with the ship?

12:08.312 --> 12:12.055
- Suicide doesn't seem like your style.
- I'm not going down with anything.

12:12.149 --> 12:16.813
But you and the rest of Jacob's
little "candidates" absolutely are.

12:17.112 --> 12:18.852
We're not candidates anymore.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.030
I'll be seein' ya.

12:31.043 --> 12:32.328
You're not gonna go after him?

12:33.879 --> 12:35.494
I don't need to.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.955
When you said you were
gonna destroy the island,

12:38.050 --> 12:39.961
I thought you were
speaking figuratively.

12:40.052 --> 12:42.293
Because I said I'd leave you in charge
once I was gone?

12:44.389 --> 12:46.050
I'm sorry if I left out the part

12:46.141 --> 12:48.177
about the island being
on the bottom of the ocean.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.180
That being said, you're welcome
to join me on my boat.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.513
Because once we get Desmond
to do what we need him to do,

12:55.317 --> 13:00.357
I'm gonna sail away from this
godforsaken place and watch it sink.

13:08.038 --> 13:09.869
I think there was a dog here.

13:20.592 --> 13:21.581
Morning.

13:25.681 --> 13:28.138
Morning. Sleep OK?

13:28.725 --> 13:29.714
Aye.

13:30.602 --> 13:32.809
Your camp's a lot nicer
than the bottom of a well.

13:33.814 --> 13:36.305
I think I'm gonna go ahead
and take that as a compliment.

13:36.400 --> 13:40.063
Are you gonna talk his ear off or you
gonna get the man some breakfast?

13:40.153 --> 13:42.235
Guess I'll go check the traps for fish.

13:44.408 --> 13:47.900
Come on. Vincent.
Let's go.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.831
So, Rose, tell me...

13:53.375 --> 13:55.366
...how long have the two of you
been living here?

13:55.460 --> 13:59.999
Well, we built this place in '75, and...

14:00.090 --> 14:04.459
lived here a couple of years,
and then the sky lit up again.

14:04.553 --> 14:08.137
So God only knows
when in the hell we are now.

14:10.976 --> 14:15.345
So, Desmond...
I don't mean to be rude,

14:15.439 --> 14:19.557
but after you eat,
I'm gonna ask you to move on.

14:21.069 --> 14:22.934
We broke our rule with you.

14:24.281 --> 14:27.068
- What rule is that?
- We don't get involved.

14:27.159 --> 14:32.028
Whatever got you tossed inside a well,
that's the kind of drama

14:32.122 --> 14:34.613
Bernard and I don't want
to have anything to do with.

14:36.251 --> 14:37.331
Fair enough.

14:43.133 --> 14:45.545
- Looks like you caught something.
- I'm sorry.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.604
Hello, Rose.

15:06.948 --> 15:10.281
I'll make this simple.
Come with me, now,

15:10.368 --> 15:13.110
or I'll kill them both
right in front of you.

15:15.165 --> 15:17.326
You don't have to go
anywhere with him.

15:21.338 --> 15:22.498
I'll make it hurt.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.181
I want your word...

15:35.852 --> 15:37.137
...you won't touch them.

15:38.396 --> 15:39.476
Ever.

15:41.024 --> 15:42.355
Done.

15:43.693 --> 15:47.777
- Then I'll do what you want.
- Yes, Desmond.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.364
You will.

16:05.507 --> 16:07.714
You have any idea
where I'm taking you, Desmond?

16:08.468 --> 16:12.882
Nope. But I assume it's a place
where there's a very bright light.

16:16.268 --> 16:17.553
What makes you say that?

16:19.813 --> 16:20.893
Just a hunch.

16:24.860 --> 16:27.943
- What was that?
- What was what?

16:40.292 --> 16:42.533
Linus, can you hear me? Come in.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.577
I found Alpert.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.170
Linus?

16:49.384 --> 16:50.464
Damn it.

16:54.431 --> 16:58.219
- You OK?
- What... What happened?

16:59.436 --> 17:03.145
You thought it'd be a good idea
to talk to the black smoke.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.768
lt responded by throwing you
into the damn jungle.

17:06.735 --> 17:09.772
- Locke... is he still here?
- No.

17:10.572 --> 17:11.652
Here.

17:11.740 --> 17:15.107
I've been trying to get Linus
on the walkie. He won't pick up.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.948
- Come on. Let's get you some help.
- Help? Help? Help from where?

17:20.040 --> 17:22.406
You still have the explosives?
The C-4?

17:22.500 --> 17:24.001
Yeah. Why?

17:24.085 --> 17:26.952
Because we need to go to the other
island and finish what we started.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.375
We need to blow up that plane.

17:56.201 --> 17:58.112
- Detective Ford.
- Jim, it's me.

17:58.203 --> 18:01.240
- I think | just saw that Jarrah guy.
- You at county lockup?

18:01.331 --> 18:04.323
No, I'm at my dad's
museum concert benefit thing.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.454
Well, it can't be Jarrah. ljust put him
in a van to county an hour ago.

18:07.545 --> 18:10.036
Really? Because I just called,
and they said it never showed up.

18:10.131 --> 18:11.837
- What?
- Help me out here, Jim.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.836
Jarrah popped four people
in cold blood.

18:13.927 --> 18:16.384
Only one witness
left the scene alive, right?

18:16.471 --> 18:18.757
Some Korean woman.
Can you make sure she's OK?

18:18.848 --> 18:22.340
Yeah, yeah. Sun Paik. Gunshot wound.
She's still over at the hospital.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.643
Enjoy your concert, Enos.
I'll keep her safe.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.089
Am I interrupting?

19:05.270 --> 19:06.885
Hi.

19:06.980 --> 19:11.690
Ms. Paik, l'm Juliet Carlson.
I'm here to make sure your baby's OK.

19:14.612 --> 19:15.863
You must be the daddy.

19:19.075 --> 19:24.286
I'm sorry. You don't speak English.
l'm... I'll try not to talk too much.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.129
OK, you lift up your gown a little bit.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.633
It's a little cold.

19:53.234 --> 19:54.974
OK. Let's take a look.

20:08.458 --> 20:09.664
You OK?

20:19.928 --> 20:21.168
There it is.

20:23.640 --> 20:24.846
Here's your baby.

21:09.727 --> 21:13.265
Do you see that little flutter?
Right there?

21:15.775 --> 21:20.018
That's the baby's heartbeat.
Perfectly perfect in every way.

21:26.244 --> 21:28.781
l have your amnio results.
Everything checked out.

21:28.872 --> 21:31.488
Would you like to know
if it's a boy or a girl?

21:32.834 --> 21:34.244
It's a girl.

21:35.587 --> 21:39.171
- Yeah.
- Her name is Ji Yeon.

21:39.257 --> 21:41.464
That's a lovely name.

21:41.551 --> 21:45.043
And for the record,
you two speak English just fine.

21:46.389 --> 21:47.720
Congratulations.

22:07.076 --> 22:11.069
Easy, Bigfoot. It's just me.
I found Locke.

22:11.164 --> 22:13.530
Son of a bitch said
he's gonna destroy the island.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.286
You had it right, doc.

22:16.377 --> 22:17.958
Good news is,
Desmond got out of that well,

22:18.046 --> 22:19.752
so if we can find him
before Smokey can...

22:19.839 --> 22:21.875
It doesn't matter if we find Desmond
or he does, James.

22:21.966 --> 22:24.082
We're all going
to the same place anyway.

22:25.053 --> 22:26.338
Then what?

22:27.472 --> 22:28.928
Then it ends.

22:52.539 --> 22:54.825
- Hello, Mr. Locke.
- Dr. Shephard.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.574
Hey, since you're about
to open up my back,

22:57.669 --> 22:59.330
you can probably start calling me John.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.797
OK, John.

23:02.382 --> 23:05.670
Thought I'd stop by and say hi
before we started the anesthesia.

23:07.220 --> 23:08.300
You nervous?

23:10.848 --> 23:16.468
- Are you sure this is gonna work?
- Yes. I'm very confident that it will.

23:17.438 --> 23:18.427
Really?

23:18.523 --> 23:21.856
Well, there's always the chance
that I could kill you...

23:22.652 --> 23:25.143
But I'm trying to make you feel better.

23:25.822 --> 23:28.313
OK. OK, let's do it.

23:29.325 --> 23:31.407
All right.
I'll see you on the other side.

23:31.995 --> 23:35.237
Hey, doctor, back at LAX,
when we met at baggage claim,

23:35.331 --> 23:38.573
you mentioned that they had lost
your father. Did he ever turn up?

23:39.627 --> 23:41.913
As a matter of fact,
I got a phone call this morning.

23:42.005 --> 23:45.418
- They... They found the coffin.
- Oh, good.

23:45.508 --> 23:47.840
Actually, it might be here already.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.009
Well, I hope that brings you
some peace.

23:51.389 --> 23:55.223
lfl can fix you, Mr. Locke,
that's all the peace I'll need.

24:10.325 --> 24:12.190
It's gonna be a hell of a storm.

24:12.994 --> 24:15.781
- Welcome to the club.
- What?

24:16.372 --> 24:17.703
You mind?

24:22.378 --> 24:24.539
Looks like you got your first gray hair.

24:35.058 --> 24:36.389
What are you smiling about?

24:37.268 --> 24:39.884
I think | just realized
that I want to live.

24:40.438 --> 24:41.974
It's good timing.

24:57.705 --> 24:58.945
What was that?

25:06.631 --> 25:07.837
Help!

25:10.635 --> 25:11.795
Hey!

25:12.387 --> 25:14.218
Hey! Miles, up ahead!

25:18.351 --> 25:19.682
Hey!

25:21.896 --> 25:22.931
Water.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.071
Get him some water.

25:41.791 --> 25:43.782
What are you guys doing out here?

25:44.085 --> 25:46.041
We're going to Hydra Island
to blow up a plane.

25:48.297 --> 25:49.912
What do you want to do that for?

25:50.007 --> 25:52.293
Because the black smoke
wants to get off the island

25:52.385 --> 25:53.966
and we have to stop that thing
from leaving.

25:55.972 --> 25:59.305
Well, if we leave, that thing
won't have a plane anymore.

26:00.476 --> 26:02.182
Yeah, and how are we gonna do that?

26:02.270 --> 26:05.762
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a pilot.

26:32.717 --> 26:35.254
- Well, this is gonna be interesting.
- Kate!

26:37.513 --> 26:40.129
- Kate!
- You killed them!

26:41.768 --> 26:43.599
Kate! That's it.

26:43.686 --> 26:45.768
- That's it.
- You might wanna save your bullets.

26:52.528 --> 26:55.110
- So it's you.
- Yeah, it's me.

26:55.948 --> 26:59.281
Jacob being who he is, I expected
to be a little more surprised.

26:59.368 --> 27:01.495
You're sort of the obvious choice,
don't you think?

27:01.579 --> 27:04.491
He didn't choose me. I volunteered.

27:06.626 --> 27:10.414
- I assume you're here to stop me.
- I can't stop you.

27:11.214 --> 27:13.705
In fact, I... I wanna go with you.

27:15.593 --> 27:17.458
I'm sorry, Jack.
I think you're a little confused

27:17.553 --> 27:19.839
- about what I came here to do.
- No, I'm not.

27:20.556 --> 27:23.263
No, you're going to the far side
of the bamboo forest,

27:23.351 --> 27:25.637
to the place that I've sworn
that I'll protect.

27:27.355 --> 27:29.266
And then you think
you're gonna destroy the island.

27:30.233 --> 27:32.394
- I "think"?
- That's right.

27:32.485 --> 27:34.521
Because that's not what's gonna happen.

27:36.531 --> 27:38.567
Then what's gonna happen, Jack?

27:40.701 --> 27:42.362
I'm gonna kill you.

27:46.582 --> 27:48.664
How do you plan to do that?

27:50.253 --> 27:51.618
That's a surprise.

27:56.926 --> 28:00.134
OK. Then let's get on with it.

28:13.109 --> 28:14.269
Doctor.

28:15.570 --> 28:16.730
Doctor.

28:16.821 --> 28:19.608
- I didn't know you were working today.
- | just finished.

28:19.699 --> 28:21.815
Did you get the tickets
for the concert?

28:21.909 --> 28:23.615
Yep. Right here.

28:26.330 --> 28:29.447
- Dad, did you remember the tickets?
- | just gave them to your mom.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.034
Who's gonna take yours?

28:34.130 --> 28:36.462
If you don't have anybody else,
maybe you could take Aunt Claire.

28:36.549 --> 28:38.756
I'm sure she'd love
to get out of the house.

28:38.843 --> 28:40.424
Oh, yeah. It's fine with me.

28:40.511 --> 28:43.173
In fact, I'm very curious to meet
this mysterious sister

28:43.264 --> 28:45.971
you never mentioned
the entire time we were married.

28:46.058 --> 28:49.175
Well, I'm sure you're gonna love her.
She's extremely pregnant.

28:51.522 --> 28:54.730
- Good luck on your surgery, doctor.
- Thank you.

28:54.817 --> 28:56.273
- Did you pick out a tie?
- I did.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.520
Nice.

29:00.656 --> 29:01.987
Sorry.

29:04.118 --> 29:06.860
Hi. I'm Detective Ford, LAPD.

29:06.954 --> 29:09.411
I'm looking for a patient's room:
Sun Paik.

29:15.671 --> 29:18.083
Something you wanna share
with the rest of us, doc?

29:18.883 --> 29:22.341
- What's that?
- You said you were gonna kill Locke.

29:22.428 --> 29:25.511
- What's your surprise?
- Desmond.

29:25.973 --> 29:29.215
- And how's that gonna work?
- I'm not sure yet.

29:29.936 --> 29:32.552
I can't believe Jacob would've brought
him all the way back to this island

29:32.647 --> 29:34.103
just so Locke could make him destroy it.

29:34.190 --> 29:38.604
- So what? Desmond's bait?
- No. I think he's a weapon.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.360
That's a hell of a long con, doc.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.958
Jack, Desmond...

30:00.883 --> 30:03.545
It should just be
the three of us from here on.

30:19.360 --> 30:20.691
Jack.

30:21.737 --> 30:23.648
I believe in you, dude.

30:42.550 --> 30:44.086
It's gonna be a bad one.

30:59.775 --> 31:01.106
We're here.

31:16.959 --> 31:19.792
- This doesn't matter, you know.
- Excuse me?

31:20.671 --> 31:23.538
Him destroying the island,
you destroying him...

31:25.551 --> 31:26.882
It doesn't matter.

31:28.888 --> 31:31.504
I mean, you're gonna lower me
into that light,

31:31.599 --> 31:33.305
and I'm gonna go somewhere else...

31:34.060 --> 31:37.723
...a place where we can be
with the ones that we love,

31:37.813 --> 31:40.395
and not have to ever think about
this damn island again.

31:42.818 --> 31:46.231
- And you know the best part, Jack?
- What?

31:47.239 --> 31:48.820
You're in this place.

31:50.618 --> 31:54.861
You know, we sat next to each other
on Oceanic 815.

31:57.917 --> 32:01.409
It never crashed.
We spoke to each other.

32:01.504 --> 32:03.165
You seemed happy.

32:05.800 --> 32:08.291
You know, maybe I can find a way
to bring you there, too.

32:09.929 --> 32:14.764
Desmond, I tried that once.
There are no shortcuts, no do-overs.

32:14.850 --> 32:17.432
What happened, happened.
Trust me, I know.

32:18.979 --> 32:21.015
All of this matters.

32:23.067 --> 32:24.056
Shall we?

32:59.770 --> 33:01.431
What are we doing here?

33:03.065 --> 33:04.601
I'm not allowed to tell you.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.808
What do you mean
you're "not allowed"?

33:07.903 --> 33:10.815
- There are rules, dude.
- Whose rules?

33:10.906 --> 33:13.989
Don't worry about it.
Just trust me, OK?

33:15.661 --> 33:17.242
I trust you.

33:18.414 --> 33:21.747
And what, may I ask, have I done
to deserve your trust?

33:23.210 --> 33:25.792
I think you're a good guy, Sayid.

33:26.922 --> 33:29.254
I know a lot of people
have told you that you're not.

33:30.092 --> 33:32.925
Maybe you've heard it so many times
you started believing it.

33:34.930 --> 33:37.842
But you can't let other people
tell you what you are, dude.

33:37.933 --> 33:40.219
You have to decide that for yourself.

33:41.812 --> 33:43.348
I'm sorry.

33:44.607 --> 33:47.599
You clearly don't know
anything about me.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.438
I know a lot about you, dude.

34:01.582 --> 34:03.698
Looks like a gnarly fight.

34:09.215 --> 34:11.547
Hey, leave my brother alone!

34:26.649 --> 34:28.856
Hey, it's all right.

34:55.427 --> 34:56.758
Sayid.

34:58.013 --> 34:59.423
Shannon.

35:06.772 --> 35:10.890
ljust got pounded, man.
Thanks for taking your sweet time.

35:10.985 --> 35:12.850
It takes as long as it takes.

35:14.989 --> 35:17.901
It was a pain in the ass
getting her here from Australia.

35:17.992 --> 35:20.449
Yeah. But, dude? It was worth it.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.701
Should I go get 'em?

35:28.544 --> 35:30.751
Nah. Let's give 'em a minute.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.050
Linus, are you there?

35:47.980 --> 35:51.017
- What the hell's that?
- Miles, where are you?

35:51.108 --> 35:54.521
We just got to Hydra island.
We're on our way to the plane.

35:54.611 --> 35:55.942
Miles, listen to me,
whatever you do,

35:56.030 --> 35:58.112
- don't blow up that plane!
- We're not gonna blow it up.

35:58.198 --> 36:01.361
We're gonna fly it the hell off
the island. Just get over here now!

36:02.411 --> 36:03.446
What the hell?

36:06.957 --> 36:07.946
Claire.

36:09.001 --> 36:13.745
Miles, it's Kate.
Did you say "Claire"? Is she OK?

36:15.382 --> 36:16.792
Put the gun down.

36:21.096 --> 36:24.133
- Don't come any closer!
- Miles?

36:25.559 --> 36:27.140
Miles, what happened?

36:27.227 --> 36:30.811
- Miles, are you there?
- He sent you to kill me, didn't he?

36:30.898 --> 36:34.811
- No, listen. We're not with Locke.
- Why should I believe you?

36:34.902 --> 36:37.939
Because we have a real chance
to get far, far away from him.

36:38.530 --> 36:42.773
We can be free of everything
he ever did to us and never look back.

36:45.996 --> 36:47.156
We can go home.

36:53.003 --> 36:54.584
Will you come with us, Claire?

36:58.550 --> 36:59.539
No.

37:12.773 --> 37:14.434
All right, we...

37:15.442 --> 37:17.023
We lower him down nice and easy.

37:18.112 --> 37:19.568
You know what to do
once you get down there?

37:19.655 --> 37:20.644
Aye.

37:22.825 --> 37:24.190
I'll go where the light's brightest.

37:25.828 --> 37:27.659
Don't get yourself killed.

37:51.645 --> 37:53.601
This remind you of anything, Jack?

37:54.606 --> 37:55.686
What?

37:58.694 --> 38:02.186
Desmond going down into
a hole in the ground.

38:03.699 --> 38:05.189
If there was a button
down there to push,

38:05.284 --> 38:07.149
we could fight about
whether or not to push it.

38:09.580 --> 38:10.990
It'd be just like old times.

38:12.207 --> 38:13.538
You're not John Locke.

38:16.378 --> 38:18.619
You disrespect his memory
by wearing his face,

38:18.714 --> 38:20.124
but you're nothing like him.

38:21.592 --> 38:23.753
Turns out he was right
about most everything.

38:23.844 --> 38:27.302
ljust wish I could've told him that
while he was still alive.

38:28.724 --> 38:30.760
He wasn't right about anything, Jack.

38:31.518 --> 38:36.353
And when this island drops into
the ocean, and you drop with it,

38:36.440 --> 38:38.476
you're finally gonna realize that.

38:41.570 --> 38:45.404
Well, we'll just have to see
which one of us is right, then.

39:24.446 --> 39:27.313
- It's the hospital.
- Go ahead. I'm sure it's important.

39:27.407 --> 39:29.739
I am so sorry.
I will be back as soon as I can.

39:29.826 --> 39:30.952
I know. It's cool. Go.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.651
We'll get to know each other
better, I hope?

39:32.746 --> 39:33.781
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

39:36.458 --> 39:39.120
Well, I guess
it'sjust you and me, kid.

39:47.970 --> 39:50.712
Wake up. Wake up.
Come on. Wake up.

39:52.891 --> 39:55.724
- What are you doin'?
- l'mjust following the instructions.

39:56.645 --> 40:00.229
- You're in the band, aren't you?
- How do you know that?

40:07.155 --> 40:09.020
l was shot by a fat man.

40:10.784 --> 40:12.149
It's all right.

40:14.788 --> 40:16.028
Excuse me.

40:17.541 --> 40:19.623
Hey, excuse me.
Do you know where the band is?

40:22.879 --> 40:26.713
- I'm sorry. Pardon me?
- I think he's in the band.

40:28.385 --> 40:33.345
Yes, yes. Of course.
He's the bass player from Drive Shaft.

40:33.432 --> 40:37.220
They're accompanying me tonight.
I play piano.

40:39.688 --> 40:42.350
l'm Daniel. Daniel Widmore.

40:43.358 --> 40:44.609
l'm Charlotte.

40:44.693 --> 40:47.275
It's a great pleasure
to meet you, Charlotte.

40:48.238 --> 40:49.569
You, too.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.321
Well, lead the way.

40:58.373 --> 41:02.867
- Excuse me. Is this table 23?
- Aye. Indeed it is.

41:05.297 --> 41:06.377
Claire?

41:09.217 --> 41:10.377
You two know each other?

41:11.386 --> 41:14.549
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
May l have your attention, please?

41:16.183 --> 41:18.970
Welcome to this
very special benefit concert

41:19.061 --> 41:22.053
for the Golden State
Natural History Museum.

41:22.147 --> 41:24.479
l'm Dr. Pierre Chang.

41:26.109 --> 41:27.224
Thank you.

41:28.445 --> 41:30.982
I think we have quite
a special evening ahead of us.

41:31.073 --> 41:33.655
So let's get to it, shall we?

41:34.159 --> 41:37.993
It is my pleasure to introduce you
to Mr. Daniel Widmore,

41:38.080 --> 41:40.162
accompanied by Drive Shaft.

42:39.474 --> 42:40.463
You OK?

42:41.226 --> 42:43.968
Yeah. Yeah, l'mjust...
I'm just gonna use the bathroom.

42:44.062 --> 42:45.563
|'||... I'll be right back.

45:06.288 --> 45:07.448
No!

45:08.456 --> 45:09.957
No!

45:14.129 --> 45:16.461
It looks like...

45:17.048 --> 45:18.254
...you were wrong.

45:21.344 --> 45:22.925
Goodbye, Jack.

45:47.996 --> 45:49.987
Looks like you were wrong, too.

46:13.772 --> 46:14.761
Hello?

46:15.815 --> 46:16.804
Hello?

46:17.692 --> 46:19.978
Hi. Do you know
where the bathroom is?

46:25.241 --> 46:27.106
Can you please get a doctor?

46:28.828 --> 46:29.817
Small world, huh?

46:29.913 --> 46:33.076
- Yeah, well, what are you doing... OK.
- OK. OK. OK.

46:33.166 --> 46:36.829
- It's OK. Come on. Sit down.
- I think he's coming.

46:53.561 --> 46:57.145
I thought I made it clear
that you were to stop this.

46:57.232 --> 47:00.850
Perfectly clear.
I chose to ignore you.

47:05.448 --> 47:10.613
- And once they know, what then?
- Then? We're leaving.

47:16.001 --> 47:18.037
Are you going to take my son?

47:25.260 --> 47:27.967
Not with me. No.

47:35.645 --> 47:37.931
Just breathe, OK?
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

47:38.023 --> 47:39.934
Help is on the way.

47:40.025 --> 47:41.936
lt's hap... lt's happening,
like, right now.

47:42.861 --> 47:43.850
Right now?

47:47.407 --> 47:50.319
OK. I'm gonna get you comfortable.

47:50.827 --> 47:53.068
I want you to relax and breathe,
all right?

47:53.163 --> 47:55.905
- Just relax and breathe.
- Who are you?

47:55.999 --> 47:57.034
I'm with the band.

47:58.418 --> 48:00.249
Listen, can you get us
some water and blankets, please?

48:00.336 --> 48:02.588
- Water and blankets?
- Yeah. All right.

48:04.716 --> 48:05.796
Claire...

48:05.884 --> 48:09.968
...this is about the time when
you're supposed to start pushing.

48:11.139 --> 48:13.004
No, I'm not ready. I'm really scared.

48:13.099 --> 48:15.966
I'm scared, too, all right?
Really scared.

48:16.061 --> 48:20.179
But I'm gonna need you to push
because I can't do it without you.

48:20.273 --> 48:25.313
OK? OK.
One, two, three. Push!

48:25.403 --> 48:26.643
Push!

48:28.114 --> 48:30.275
Good. That's good.
OK, we're gonna try again.

48:30.366 --> 48:34.905
You're doing good.
One, two, three. Push!

48:46.633 --> 48:48.874
OK. Push... Push again.

48:49.969 --> 48:51.300
Push!

49:32.387 --> 49:35.049
lt's Aaron. lt's...

49:55.660 --> 49:57.116
I brought a blanket.

50:06.546 --> 50:09.913
- Thank you.
- It's just a blanket.

50:10.925 --> 50:12.586
Then go ahead and bring it to her.

50:16.264 --> 50:18.050
Couldn't find any water.

50:30.570 --> 50:31.559
Charlie.

50:53.968 --> 50:56.425
- Claire?
- Yeah.

50:58.139 --> 50:59.470
Claire.

51:08.483 --> 51:12.396
Hello, Aaron. Aaron. Hey.

51:18.451 --> 51:19.907
Magical.

51:19.994 --> 51:21.655
Hey, Aaron.

51:28.962 --> 51:30.168
Do you understand?

51:34.550 --> 51:36.211
So now what?

51:53.653 --> 51:55.735
Hugo! Get out of the way!

52:31.065 --> 52:33.056
Desmond!

52:36.279 --> 52:37.564
Desmond!

52:45.997 --> 52:47.828
We're gonna get you
out of here, all right?

52:52.545 --> 52:54.957
It's too damn heavy! There's no way
we're gettin' it off of him!

52:55.048 --> 52:58.632
- We have to try!
- One... two... three!

53:09.687 --> 53:10.927
What is happening?!

53:11.022 --> 53:13.513
I'll tell you what's happening!
Locke was right!

53:13.608 --> 53:16.441
- This island's goin' down!
- Linus, come in!

53:18.404 --> 53:19.393
Linus, come in!

53:24.202 --> 53:25.863
Linus, come in!

53:26.913 --> 53:29.905
- Come in!
- Miles, is that you?

53:29.999 --> 53:32.456
Yeah. What the hell is happening?

53:32.543 --> 53:33.794
Are you with Claire?

53:33.878 --> 53:35.960
She's here, but she doesn't
want to come with us.

53:36.047 --> 53:37.583
Come with you where?

53:37.673 --> 53:40.710
Lapidus is working on the plane
right now, then we're taking off.

53:49.519 --> 53:52.352
Hey, how much longer
till we get this thing in the air?

53:52.438 --> 53:56.022
I still have to check the electrical
and the hydraulics!

53:56.109 --> 53:59.772
- Five hours, maybe six.
- You've got maybe one!

53:59.862 --> 54:02.353
Get your asses over here!
We're leaving in an hour!

54:03.825 --> 54:05.031
Son of a bitch!

54:05.118 --> 54:07.325
How the hell are we supposed
to get over there?!

54:07.412 --> 54:09.243
I know how we can get there!

54:11.374 --> 54:13.365
Locke has a boat!

54:28.266 --> 54:29.756
Locke!

56:14.956 --> 56:16.617
I want you to know, Jack...

56:17.875 --> 56:20.287
...you died for nothing.

56:27.969 --> 56:30.176
I saved you a bullet!

56:47.530 --> 56:48.940
You're too late.

57:15.266 --> 57:17.473
Nice work, Dr. Shephard.

57:22.023 --> 57:23.763
What happened to your neck?

57:27.111 --> 57:28.521
Damn it.

57:34.035 --> 57:36.151
OK, he's stable.
I'm gonna hop in the shower

57:36.245 --> 57:38.952
and see if I can catch up with David
before the concert's over.

57:39.040 --> 57:40.325
So just give me a call
if you need anything.

57:40.416 --> 57:41.997
Dr. Shephard?

57:43.044 --> 57:44.375
He's waking up.

57:46.005 --> 57:48.667
I watched the anesthesiologist.
He got the full dosage.

57:49.634 --> 57:52.467
OK. I'll take it from here.

57:54.430 --> 57:56.842
Mr. Locke? Can you hear me?

57:59.185 --> 58:00.641
John, are you awake?

58:03.856 --> 58:05.517
You just had major surgery,

58:05.608 --> 58:10.227
so I need you to try not to move
and just relax, OK?

58:11.614 --> 58:14.651
- It worked.
- Well, it went well.

58:14.742 --> 58:17.575
But we won't know how well
you responded to the surgery for...

58:17.662 --> 58:19.573
No, Dr. Shephard. ltworked.

58:21.957 --> 58:24.084
I can feel my legs.

58:25.086 --> 58:27.202
John, it's highly unlikely

58:27.296 --> 58:29.207
that you would regain sensation
that quickly.

58:29.298 --> 58:30.834
So let's just take it...

59:01.622 --> 59:04.534
- Did you see that?
- See what?

59:10.840 --> 59:12.751
You don't remember?

59:18.097 --> 59:22.010
Mr. Locke,
please, just... just relax.

59:22.101 --> 59:24.387
- What we need to do...
- What we need to do is go.

59:24.478 --> 59:26.218
No, no, no. Hey, John.

59:26.313 --> 59:29.555
- Will you come with me?
- We're not going anywhere.

59:29.650 --> 59:34.565
You just had extensive spinal surgery
and I need to go see my son.

59:35.614 --> 59:37.195
You don't have a son.

59:39.910 --> 59:41.161
What?

59:41.829 --> 59:43.535
You don't have a son, Jack.

59:45.332 --> 59:46.412
Doctor?

59:47.835 --> 59:49.245
Jane”.

59:49.336 --> 59:52.794
...would you give Mr. Locke something
to help him rest? I need to go.

59:52.882 --> 59:54.042
Jack.

59:56.510 --> 1:00:00.719
I hope that somebody does for you

1:00:00.806 --> 1:00:03.422
what you just did for me.

1:00:31.712 --> 1:00:32.827
Oh, my God.

1:00:38.385 --> 1:00:40.171
- Jack.
- I'll be fine.

1:00:41.680 --> 1:00:43.932
Just find me some thread,
and I can count to five.

1:00:48.270 --> 1:00:49.385
Oh, my God!

1:00:50.439 --> 1:00:51.724
What the hell happened?

1:00:52.566 --> 1:00:54.067
Locke's dead.

1:00:55.152 --> 1:00:56.562
It's over.

1:01:09.750 --> 1:01:11.991
It sure don't feel like it's over.

1:01:20.219 --> 1:01:22.005
Excuse me. Ms. Paik?

1:01:22.429 --> 1:01:23.555
Yes?

1:01:24.849 --> 1:01:26.339
Hi.

1:01:27.268 --> 1:01:31.637
l'm Detective Ford, LAPD.
I'm sorry. I heard you were shot,

1:01:31.730 --> 1:01:34.312
but I didn't expect you
to be checking out so soon.

1:01:36.151 --> 1:01:37.357
Hey.

1:01:37.444 --> 1:01:39.981
Hello... detective.

1:01:40.739 --> 1:01:44.652
Well, I came by to check
if you've seen this man.

1:01:44.743 --> 1:01:47.359
He escaped custody, and we're
worried he might come after you.

1:01:47.454 --> 1:01:49.786
I'm gonna assign a uniform
to keep an eye on you until we can...

1:01:49.874 --> 1:01:51.205
You don't have to do that.

1:01:54.628 --> 1:01:57.540
All due respect,
I have a job to do here, ma'am.

1:01:57.631 --> 1:02:01.249
- I need to keep you safe.
- It's OK. I am safe.

1:02:05.472 --> 1:02:06.973
We'll see you there.

1:02:10.060 --> 1:02:11.641
See me where?

1:02:15.608 --> 1:02:18.190
All right. It ain't pretty,
but it's gonna work.

1:02:19.153 --> 1:02:20.893
I've gotta reset the electronics.

1:02:30.956 --> 1:02:32.821
Something's wrong with the hydraulics
down in the nose wheel.

1:02:33.417 --> 1:02:36.659
Either one of you guys
mechanical? Yeah?

1:02:36.754 --> 1:02:39.336
I worked for a contractor
renovating apartments

1:02:39.423 --> 1:02:41.505
- for a couple summers.
- Here, take that.

1:02:41.842 --> 1:02:43.457
And this... and this.

1:02:43.552 --> 1:02:45.838
Go down there, make sure
everything's hooked up all right.

1:02:46.805 --> 1:02:47.794
Go!

1:02:49.516 --> 1:02:51.677
- Lapidus?
- Yeah?

1:02:51.769 --> 1:02:54.101
Frank, how's it going over there?
What's your timetable?

1:02:54.188 --> 1:02:55.303
Don't bother me!

1:02:56.857 --> 1:02:58.722
Sounds like they're making progress.

1:03:09.620 --> 1:03:12.282
- We gotta go now.
- I don't understand.

1:03:15.786 --> 1:03:15.876
Locke's dead.
Why is this still happening?

1:03:15.876 --> 1:03:17.867
Because whatever Desmond turned off...

1:03:19.254 --> 1:03:21.290
...I need to turn it back on again.

1:03:21.382 --> 1:03:23.418
But if it doesn't work,
if I don't get it done,

1:03:23.509 --> 1:03:26.091
you all need to leave now.
You need to be on that plane.

1:03:27.596 --> 1:03:31.054
You can come with us, too, Jack.
You don't have to do this.

1:03:32.017 --> 1:03:34.850
- No, I do have to.
- No, you don't.

1:03:36.522 --> 1:03:40.640
- Let the island sink, Jack.
- Kate, I can't.

1:03:48.951 --> 1:03:51.442
You think you can get that boat
across the channel in time?

1:03:51.537 --> 1:03:52.743
Yeah, I can manage.

1:04:00.379 --> 1:04:05.840
- Good luck to you, James.
- Thanks, doc, for everything.

1:04:09.763 --> 1:04:11.094
James!

1:04:13.809 --> 1:04:16.471
lfthe island's going down,
I'm going down with it.

1:04:18.814 --> 1:04:24.150
- Hugo. You better get going.
- No way. You think I'm going down that?

1:04:24.570 --> 1:04:27.903
- I'm with you, dude.
- OK.

1:04:30.701 --> 1:04:32.032
Kate...

1:04:33.162 --> 1:04:34.527
...you gotta go.

1:04:35.539 --> 1:04:37.825
Get Claire on that plane.

1:04:45.966 --> 1:04:47.672
Tell me I'm gonna see you again.

1:05:14.953 --> 1:05:16.409
I love you.

1:05:20.250 --> 1:05:21.911
I love you.

1:05:57.955 --> 1:05:59.445
Can you fix it?

1:05:59.540 --> 1:06:02.907
I don't believe in a lot of things,
but I do believe in duct tape.

1:06:03.710 --> 1:06:04.961
Yeah, I think we're good.

1:06:07.881 --> 1:06:09.792
Let's get the hell out of here.

1:06:12.469 --> 1:06:14.551
Yo, Chesty. lt's Sawyer and Kate.

1:06:16.181 --> 1:06:18.467
- Yeah?
- We're on our way down to the sailboat,

1:06:18.559 --> 1:06:20.345
then we're heading to you.
Don't leave without us!

1:06:21.395 --> 1:06:24.558
We're gettin' off the ground
while there's still ground to get off.

1:06:24.648 --> 1:06:26.980
So if you wanna go,
you better get your asses in gear.

1:06:28.068 --> 1:06:30.229
Lapidus! Lapidus!

1:06:30.320 --> 1:06:32.936
- Son of a bitch!
- What now?

1:06:38.078 --> 1:06:39.284
Wejump.

1:06:49.173 --> 1:06:50.333
I'll see you at the boat.

1:06:51.341 --> 1:06:52.330
Kate!

1:07:14.281 --> 1:07:16.772
Hey, you know where I can get
some grub around here?

1:07:17.826 --> 1:07:21.364
The cafeteria's closed, but there's
a vending machine down the hallway.

1:07:23.457 --> 1:07:26.665
- Thanks, doc.
- Yeah, no problem.

1:07:49.399 --> 1:07:50.650
Oh, come on.

1:07:54.821 --> 1:07:56.027
Unbelievable.

1:08:08.752 --> 1:08:10.083
Can I help you?

1:08:11.129 --> 1:08:13.666
It's OK. I'm a...

1:08:14.383 --> 1:08:15.748
I'm a cop.

1:08:15.842 --> 1:08:17.969
Maybe you should
read the machine its rights.

1:08:20.931 --> 1:08:22.512
That's funny.

1:08:23.016 --> 1:08:25.177
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Please.

1:08:25.269 --> 1:08:28.932
If you unplug it, and then
you plug it back in again,

1:08:29.022 --> 1:08:30.887
the candy just drops right down.

1:08:31.566 --> 1:08:35.024
- Is that right?
- Yes, and it's technically legal.

1:08:38.865 --> 1:08:40.241
I'll give that a shot.

1:08:54.881 --> 1:08:56.212
It worked.

1:09:05.559 --> 1:09:06.719
Did you feel that?

1:09:12.024 --> 1:09:14.140
- We should get coffee sometime.
- I'd love to,

1:09:17.279 --> 1:09:18.894
We could go dutch.

1:09:39.843 --> 1:09:41.128
Juliet.

1:09:43.597 --> 1:09:45.428
Juliet, it's... it's me.

1:09:50.896 --> 1:09:51.885
Julie.

1:09:58.236 --> 1:10:00.067
It's me, baby.

1:10:05.786 --> 1:10:07.242
lgotyou.

1:10:08.455 --> 1:10:10.116
I got you, baby.

1:10:19.674 --> 1:10:23.132
- Kiss me, James.
- You got it, Blondie.

1:10:59.339 --> 1:11:00.545
It's over.

1:11:01.007 --> 1:11:02.042
Excuse me?

1:11:03.552 --> 1:11:06.168
The concert. It's over.

1:11:08.640 --> 1:11:10.380
You looking for someone?

1:11:12.686 --> 1:11:15.803
Yeah. My son. I was supposed
to bring him here tonight.

1:11:15.897 --> 1:11:18.513
And then I couldn't come, and...

1:11:25.073 --> 1:11:26.734
I'm sorry.

1:11:29.494 --> 1:11:33.658
- Where do I remember you from?
- I stole your pen.

1:11:35.167 --> 1:11:36.156
What?

1:11:37.669 --> 1:11:39.876
Oceanic 815.

1:11:41.089 --> 1:11:45.128
From Sydney. I bumped into you
coming out of the bathroom, and...

1:11:45.218 --> 1:11:48.631
- ...I stole your pen.
- And that's how I know you?

1:11:50.765 --> 1:11:52.096
No.

1:11:53.143 --> 1:11:54.679
That's not how you know me.

1:12:10.660 --> 1:12:12.912
I've missed you so much.

1:12:20.712 --> 1:12:21.792
Are you OK?

1:12:23.632 --> 1:12:25.497
What is happening to me?

1:12:27.010 --> 1:12:28.090
Who...?

1:12:29.012 --> 1:12:33.597
- Who are you? I don't...
- I know you don't understand, Jack.

1:12:37.229 --> 1:12:38.969
But if you come with me...

1:12:39.981 --> 1:12:41.812
...you will.

1:12:56.039 --> 1:12:57.495
It's over there.

1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:13.386
How we gettin' down there?

1:13:15.058 --> 1:13:19.472
- We're not. I'm going alone.
- Dude, you can't go down there alone.

1:13:19.563 --> 1:13:22.350
Desmond didn't make it.
How the hell are you gonna survive?

1:13:34.494 --> 1:13:35.825
No.

1:13:39.332 --> 1:13:44.622
- No way. I'm not gonna let you die.
- Hurley, I'm already dead.

1:13:44.713 --> 1:13:47.204
- You said you'd protect the island!
- And that's what I'm doing.

1:13:47.299 --> 1:13:48.914
- You're committing suicide!
- I'm not.

1:13:49.009 --> 1:13:52.126
This is the way it has to happen.
This is what I'm supposed to do.

1:13:52.220 --> 1:13:55.007
You're not supposed to die!
The island needs you!

1:13:55.098 --> 1:13:56.508
Hurley...

1:13:58.935 --> 1:14:00.766
...it needs you.

1:14:02.188 --> 1:14:06.306
- What?
- It needs to be you, Hugo.

1:14:12.699 --> 1:14:13.814
I can't.

1:14:16.077 --> 1:14:17.237
It's supposed to be you.

1:14:17.329 --> 1:14:19.866
It was only supposed to be me
so I could do this.

1:14:20.498 --> 1:14:22.534
But if someone
has to take care of the island,

1:14:22.626 --> 1:14:26.039
if someone has to protect it, then...
then it should be you.

1:14:27.130 --> 1:14:28.245
Hurley...

1:14:29.633 --> 1:14:31.749
...I believe in you.

1:14:37.098 --> 1:14:38.304
All right, I'll take it.

1:14:39.893 --> 1:14:41.303
But it's only temporary.

1:14:41.394 --> 1:14:43.726
As soon as you get that light
back on, I'm pulling you up

1:14:43.813 --> 1:14:45.553
and I'm giving it
right back to you. Deal?

1:14:46.358 --> 1:14:47.347
Deal.

1:14:53.865 --> 1:14:55.446
Do you have anything to drink?

1:14:56.826 --> 1:14:59.033
Anything to drink out of?

1:14:59.120 --> 1:15:01.327
- A cup. A canteen.
- I do.

1:15:04.459 --> 1:15:05.824
Is that OK?

1:15:06.544 --> 1:15:08.159
It's perfect.

1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:23.936
Drink this.

1:15:47.585 --> 1:15:49.166
Is that it?

1:15:55.051 --> 1:15:56.632
Now you're like me.

1:16:08.064 --> 1:16:11.682
Second time's a charm.
lt better be, 'cause we sure as hell

1:16:11.776 --> 1:16:13.641
don't have the battery power
for a third time.

1:16:22.787 --> 1:16:26.245
- Is that good?
- That, my friends, is pure music.

1:16:31.755 --> 1:16:33.086
Easy.

1:16:40.138 --> 1:16:42.595
Easy. Easy.

1:16:50.440 --> 1:16:51.429
Dude!

1:17:20.595 --> 1:17:21.960
Desmond!

1:17:23.306 --> 1:17:25.592
Desmond, can you hear me?

1:17:30.939 --> 1:17:32.475
The light...

1:17:32.565 --> 1:17:35.807
I put it out. It didn't work.

1:17:38.613 --> 1:17:40.399
I thought I'd leave this place.

1:17:41.449 --> 1:17:44.236
I got you. Come on.
Come on.

1:17:49.415 --> 1:17:50.916
I'm still here.

1:17:52.919 --> 1:17:54.500
You were right, Jack.

1:17:54.963 --> 1:17:57.329
Yeah, well, there's
a first time for everything.

1:17:59.968 --> 1:18:01.629
l have to put it back.

1:18:02.512 --> 1:18:04.423
- It was like a drain.
- That's what you did?

1:18:04.514 --> 1:18:06.596
You took that stone
out of that hole over there?

1:18:06.683 --> 1:18:07.968
Jack, you can't. Listen.

1:18:08.059 --> 1:18:10.300
Even if you turn it back on,
it'll kill ya. It has to be me.

1:18:10.395 --> 1:18:12.556
Desmond, you've done enough.

1:18:12.647 --> 1:18:15.104
You wanna do something? Go home
and be with your wife and son.

1:18:16.150 --> 1:18:18.015
How about you, Jack?

1:18:19.946 --> 1:18:22.278
I'll see you in another life, brother.

1:18:32.959 --> 1:18:34.119
Claire?

1:18:49.934 --> 1:18:51.595
That ain't good.

1:18:51.686 --> 1:18:53.847
Miles, go look out the door!
You're gonna be my eyes

1:18:53.938 --> 1:18:57.180
while I back this out of here.
Richard, go tell me what he says.

1:18:57.275 --> 1:18:58.606
Claire!

1:19:03.573 --> 1:19:04.904
Are you OK?

1:19:23.676 --> 1:19:26.053
Come on! We gotta go! Come on!

1:19:26.679 --> 1:19:28.340
- Claire, come on, please.
- I can't!

1:19:28.431 --> 1:19:30.262
- Why?!
- Look at me!

1:19:31.601 --> 1:19:35.344
This island's made me crazy.
I don't want Aaron to see me like this.

1:19:36.940 --> 1:19:39.431
I don't... I don't even know
how to be a mother anymore.

1:19:39.525 --> 1:19:40.685
Listen to me. None of us do.

1:19:42.153 --> 1:19:45.816
Not at first.
But you're not alone.

1:19:47.992 --> 1:19:49.402
Let me help you.

1:19:54.707 --> 1:19:56.208
Now come on.

1:19:57.752 --> 1:19:59.117
Let's go.

1:20:03.549 --> 1:20:06.256
- Are we clear?!
- Miles, are we clear?

1:20:06.344 --> 1:20:08.710
- Yeah, it looks like it to me!
- He says we're good.

1:20:08.805 --> 1:20:11.262
You better pray we are, Ricky boy,
'cause I'm gonna spin her around.

1:20:11.349 --> 1:20:13.010
Hold on!

1:20:16.521 --> 1:20:19.308
Sawyer! Tell him to stop!
Tell him we're coming!

1:20:19.399 --> 1:20:21.890
Lapidus! Lapidus! Lapidus, hold on!

1:20:23.736 --> 1:20:25.351
All right, we're good to go!

1:20:27.824 --> 1:20:28.859
Let's go!

1:20:46.259 --> 1:20:47.590
What the hell?

1:20:53.433 --> 1:20:55.924
Boys, we got some late arrivals.
Open the door.

1:20:58.604 --> 1:20:59.684
Come on!

1:21:52.241 --> 1:21:53.230
No.

1:21:55.036 --> 1:21:56.025
No.

1:21:57.580 --> 1:21:58.820
No.

1:22:07.965 --> 1:22:09.546
We're running out of time!

1:22:10.134 --> 1:22:11.123
Thank you.

1:22:15.264 --> 1:22:18.256
- Way to wait till the last second, Jim.
- Good to see you, too, Enos.

1:22:18.351 --> 1:22:21.013
- We got 'em!
- Everybody, buckle up tight!

1:22:21.938 --> 1:22:23.018
Hold on!

1:22:31.739 --> 1:22:33.115
Here we go, Frank.

1:23:00.351 --> 1:23:01.386
Come on.

1:23:04.230 --> 1:23:05.390
Come on.

1:23:21.205 --> 1:23:22.411
Amen.

1:24:39.867 --> 1:24:43.826
- He did it. The light's back on.
- Dude, pull!

1:24:48.876 --> 1:24:50.707
Hang on, Jack!

1:25:02.056 --> 1:25:03.262
Got him!

1:25:05.351 --> 1:25:07.763
Desmond? No.

1:25:08.854 --> 1:25:09.843
Jack!

1:25:17.196 --> 1:25:19.027
Jack!

1:25:56.736 --> 1:25:58.226
Thank you.

1:26:17.381 --> 1:26:18.712
Hello, Benjamin.

1:26:21.260 --> 1:26:22.420
Hello, John.

1:26:25.056 --> 1:26:26.967
ls everyone already inside?

1:26:28.100 --> 1:26:30.307
I believe most of them are, yes.

1:26:35.900 --> 1:26:38.482
I'm very sorry
for what I did to you, John.

1:26:41.447 --> 1:26:43.153
l was selfish...

1:26:43.240 --> 1:26:44.776
...jealous.

1:26:45.868 --> 1:26:47.233
I wanted everything you had.

1:26:51.165 --> 1:26:53.121
What did I have?

1:26:54.919 --> 1:26:57.001
You were special, John.

1:26:58.297 --> 1:27:00.333
And I wasn't.

1:27:04.095 --> 1:27:08.634
Well, if it helps, Ben, I forgive you.

1:27:11.602 --> 1:27:15.686
Thank you, John. That does help.

1:27:17.608 --> 1:27:20.350
It matters more than I can say.

1:27:22.530 --> 1:27:23.986
What are you gonna do now?

1:27:24.698 --> 1:27:26.905
l have some things
that I still need to work out.

1:27:26.992 --> 1:27:28.607
I think I'll stay here a while.

1:27:34.208 --> 1:27:37.291
You know, I don't think you need
to be in that chair anymore.

1:28:01.318 --> 1:28:03.695
Goodbye, Ben.

1:28:47.072 --> 1:28:48.812
I think Desmond's gonna be OK.

1:28:54.580 --> 1:28:56.741
Jacksu.gone.

1:28:59.126 --> 1:29:00.741
lsn't he?

1:29:10.554 --> 1:29:12.761
He did hisjob, Hugo.

1:29:14.225 --> 1:29:15.886
It's my job now.

1:29:18.812 --> 1:29:20.393
What the hell am I supposed to do?

1:29:23.108 --> 1:29:25.599
I think you do what you do best.

1:29:28.280 --> 1:29:30.271
Take care of people.

1:29:32.785 --> 1:29:35.242
You can start
by helping Desmond get home.

1:29:35.788 --> 1:29:39.155
But how? People can't leave the island.

1:29:40.584 --> 1:29:41.994
That's how Jacob ran things.

1:29:43.879 --> 1:29:45.540
Maybe there's another way.

1:29:47.299 --> 1:29:48.800
A better way.

1:29:51.595 --> 1:29:52.630
Will you help me?

1:29:54.431 --> 1:29:55.466
I'm sorry?

1:29:56.392 --> 1:30:02.058
I could really use someone with,
like... experience for a little while.

1:30:06.986 --> 1:30:08.726
Will you help me, Ben?

1:30:12.616 --> 1:30:14.277
I'd be honored.

1:30:18.080 --> 1:30:19.411
Cool.

1:30:33.887 --> 1:30:35.013
Hey,dude.

1:30:36.265 --> 1:30:39.678
- Hello, Hugo.
- We're all inside.

1:30:41.437 --> 1:30:43.428
I don't think I'm coming in.

1:30:50.362 --> 1:30:51.863
You know...

1:30:53.115 --> 1:30:55.197
...you were a real good number two.

1:30:56.702 --> 1:30:59.489
And you were a great number one, Hugo.

1:31:01.665 --> 1:31:03.201
Thanks, dude.

1:31:04.376 --> 1:31:05.752
I'll see you.

1:31:24.229 --> 1:31:25.480
Do you know where we are?

1:31:27.107 --> 1:31:29.644
This is where l was gonna have
my father's funeral.

1:31:29.735 --> 1:31:30.815
He...

1:31:31.945 --> 1:31:33.901
He died in Australia.

1:31:35.407 --> 1:31:37.272
I'm sorry.

1:31:39.703 --> 1:31:41.659
Why did you bring me here?

1:31:43.540 --> 1:31:46.998
Because this is where you were
gonna have your father's funeral.

1:31:51.715 --> 1:31:55.754
- You can go in around back.
- Wait. Where are you going?

1:31:56.136 --> 1:31:57.216
lnside.

1:31:58.681 --> 1:32:00.672
I'll be waiting for you there...

1:32:01.225 --> 1:32:02.635
...once you're ready.

1:32:05.688 --> 1:32:07.349
Ready for what?

1:32:10.234 --> 1:32:11.599
To leave.

1:35:28.682 --> 1:35:30.138
Hey, kiddo.

1:35:40.694 --> 1:35:42.025
Dad?

1:35:44.323 --> 1:35:45.779
Hello, Jack.

1:35:49.119 --> 1:35:50.575
I don't understand.

1:35:52.915 --> 1:35:54.200
You died.

1:35:55.417 --> 1:35:58.955
Yeah. Yes, I did.

1:36:01.131 --> 1:36:03.588
Then how are you here right now?

1:36:07.804 --> 1:36:09.840
How are you here?

1:36:24.863 --> 1:36:26.854
I died, too.

1:36:33.747 --> 1:36:37.035
It's OK. It's OK.

1:36:37.626 --> 1:36:39.287
It's OK, son.

1:36:55.727 --> 1:36:59.219
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you, too, son.

1:37:01.191 --> 1:37:02.601
Are you...?

1:37:04.319 --> 1:37:05.820
Are you real?

1:37:07.239 --> 1:37:09.104
I sure hope so.

1:37:11.034 --> 1:37:12.149
Yeah, I'm real.

1:37:12.953 --> 1:37:16.445
You're real. Everything that's
ever happened to you is real.

1:37:17.749 --> 1:37:21.583
All those people in the church,
they're all real, too.

1:37:22.504 --> 1:37:23.835
They're all...

1:37:24.548 --> 1:37:26.288
They're all dead?

1:37:28.927 --> 1:37:31.464
Everyone dies sometime, kiddo.

1:37:35.726 --> 1:37:37.307
Some of them before you, some...

1:37:38.311 --> 1:37:39.767
...long after you.

1:37:41.648 --> 1:37:43.855
But why are they all here now?

1:37:45.527 --> 1:37:49.270
Well, there is no "now" here.

1:38:02.210 --> 1:38:03.950
Where are we, Dad?

1:38:06.048 --> 1:38:09.040
This is a place that you...
that you all made together

1:38:09.134 --> 1:38:11.466
so that you could find one another.

1:38:18.477 --> 1:38:22.095
The most important part of your life

1:38:22.189 --> 1:38:24.601
was the time that you spent
with these people.

1:38:26.276 --> 1:38:31.270
That's why all of you are here.
Nobody does it alone, Jack.

1:38:32.616 --> 1:38:36.985
You needed all of them,
and they needed you.

1:38:39.748 --> 1:38:41.329
For what?

1:38:44.377 --> 1:38:45.878
To remember.

1:38:49.341 --> 1:38:52.003
And to... let go.

1:38:58.350 --> 1:39:02.013
Kate... She said we were leaving.

1:39:02.813 --> 1:39:04.144
Not leaving, no.

1:39:07.692 --> 1:39:09.193
Moving on.

1:39:14.866 --> 1:39:16.527
Where are we going?

1:39:21.248 --> 1:39:22.863
Let's go find out.

1:40:02.497 --> 1:40:04.078
We've been waitin' for you, now.
