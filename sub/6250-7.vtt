12:15.819 --> 12:20.904
Well, I thinkthat, uh,
God expects us to overcome
certain things.

12:20.991 --> 12:25.280
The term “trans” conveys
a meaning of “beyond,”
“across,” “moving further.”

12:25.370 --> 12:27.326
There’s a very spiritual
component.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.780
t et ’5 say some h yper-rel/gio us
fundamentalist ﬁnds out...

12:29.917 --> 12:33.751
that, uh, Sister Patricia
used to be Father Paul—
And murders her.

12:33.879 --> 12:36.336
Eh?
Okay, you mentioned
that there was...

12:36.423 --> 12:39.586
an intense message
on Patricia Ludmuller’s
answering machine, right?

12:39.676 --> 12:42.668
- Yes.
- If, say, she had sex with a man...

12:42.763 --> 12:45.505
and then informed him
that she was transgender,

12:45.599 --> 12:47.510
isn’t that a more likely
motive for murder?

12:47.601 --> 12:50.559
Anthropologically speaking,
a male’s status in a society...

12:50.646 --> 12:54.480
is closely connected
with what he perceives to be
his outward maleness.

12:54.566 --> 12:59.936
Look, there’s no way the guy
on that answering machine
knew that he— she— he—

13:00.030 --> 13:03.363
knew that she— he
was transgender.

13:03.450 --> 13:08.069
- How do you know?
- I know an “ain’t too proud to beg”
call when I hear one.

13:08.163 --> 13:11.655
- He had no idea
that she wasn’t a real woman.
- That’s very insightful.

13:11.750 --> 13:14.412
- Thank you. “Insightful,” see?
- Except for the “real woman” slip.

13:14.503 --> 13:17.961
Have you made many ofthese
“ain’t too proud to beg”
calls in the past?

13:18.048 --> 13:20.539
What do you say
wejust stay focused here?

13:20.634 --> 13:23.216
Okay. Have you ruled out
completely...

13:23.303 --> 13:25.715
that Patricia Ludmuller’s murder
might be because of something...

13:25.806 --> 13:27.717
that happened before
he became a woman?

13:27.808 --> 13:31.972
I put a request in to find out
his previous identity
before he was a woman.

13:32.062 --> 13:35.225
It’s the best I could do.
Okay, but from now on,
he is always a “she.”

13:35.315 --> 13:38.057
She was a he when she died,
so she deserves the respect due...

13:38.151 --> 13:42.269
to him or her—
okay— person!

13:44.241 --> 13:47.074
Okay. |-I’m a genius,
and I’m confused.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.071
[Exhales]

13:50.247 --> 13:53.034
[Man]
Pastor Patricia
was our center.

13:53.125 --> 13:56.117
tike the best leaders,
she drew us together
without even t/y/ng.

13:56.253 --> 14:00.622
Did you release identity?
Their pastor went for a swim
and never came back, all right?

14:00.757 --> 14:05.501
The body washed up.
Ah. Intuitive leap.
Right.

14:05.595 --> 14:08.052
Let’s pray together.

14:08.140 --> 14:11.507
t et’s pray that whatever
happened to Patricia out there
alone came peaceful/y,

14:11.601 --> 14:14.684
that God embraced her
as his daughter,

14:14.771 --> 14:18.389
that there was no pain,
only God ’5 great serenity.

14:18.483 --> 14:23.978
A moment ofsilence
for the pastor we loved... so much.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.615
What are you doing?
I’m praying.
Would you keep your voice down?

14:28.744 --> 14:32.328
I’m sorry.
I’m not a member.
It’s not a gym, Bones.

14:44.134 --> 14:48.298
- Excuse me, Mister, uh—
- Wade Schmidt. You’re F.B.I.?

14:48.388 --> 14:51.801
How did you know
that Pa tricia t udmu/ler
was the victim found in the bay?

14:51.892 --> 14:55.555
She’s a member ofour community,
and she’s gone. We feel her loss.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.556
We’re right, aren’t we?

15:02.360 --> 15:04.567
Not really.
I take care of the finances.

15:04.654 --> 15:09.068
Chuck over there— he acted
as kind ofan unofficial
assistant to Patricia.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.741
What will happen
to the church now?

15:11.828 --> 15:15.992
To be honest,
I’m not optimistic that we’ll
survive Patricia’s loss.

15:16.083 --> 15:19.701
Why? You’re a community of people
with a common superstition.

15:19.836 --> 15:23.454
The shared illusion
should be enough to bind you.
Bones

15:25.300 --> 15:29.213
Patricia would like you.
She’d say, “That’s the one
that’ll keep us honest.”

15:29.346 --> 15:32.588
See? She would’ve liked me.
She keeps everyone honest,
this one.

15:32.682 --> 15:35.014
Hey, Chuck, you got a moment?

15:35.102 --> 15:38.265
These people
are from the FBI.
[Motor Whirr/ng]

15:38.355 --> 15:41.563
- I thought Patricia drowned.
- We don’t know the cause ofdeath yet.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.766
She went for a swim
on a foggy morning.

15:43.860 --> 15:46.067
She got cut in half
by a yacht propeller...

15:46.154 --> 15:49.738
ora destroyer
return/ng to Norfolk, okay?

15:49.825 --> 15:52.441
- Chuck—
- We don’t know how the body
was disarticulated.

15:52.536 --> 15:56.529
- What the hell do you know?
- We know what we don’t know,
Mr. Kennedy.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.534
That’s why
we’re asking questions.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.617
Yeah, we do have
a few felons
in our congregation,

16:01.711 --> 16:04.498
former addicts,
not to mention
the less serious sins:

16:04.589 --> 16:08.878
lying, vanity, sloth, greed.

16:08.969 --> 16:11.631
I myself had
a meth problem.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.632
Would you like
to arrest me?

16:13.723 --> 16:15.634
Is that a confession, Chuck?

16:15.725 --> 16:19.217
Yeah. Yeah,
I’m confessing to a past.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.224
/ have a past,
l/ke everybody else.
/ bet even you do.

16:23.733 --> 16:29.069
Course, God
absolved me of my past.
Howabout you?

16:31.449 --> 16:35.033
[Motor Whirr/ng ]

16:35.162 --> 16:37.619
See you around.
He’s takin’ it hard.

16:37.706 --> 16:41.824
The way Chuck sees it,
Patn'c/a Introduced him to God
and God sa ved his life—

16:41.918 --> 16:44.330
gave him focus,
made him part ofa community.

16:44.421 --> 16:46.878
Do you have a congregant
calledJ.P.?

16:46.965 --> 16:49.798
- Yes.
- Could you point him out
to us, please?

17:00.687 --> 17:02.723
It’s still hard to believe
the pastor’s gone.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.725
I understand she was
one hell ofa swimmer.

17:04.816 --> 17:07.774
Hey, Booth, I’m lookin’
at these pictures you gave me,

17:07.861 --> 17:11.479
and body language
and facial expressions tell
some very interesting stories.

17:11.573 --> 17:14.815
- Why don’t you give me your insights.
- She swam every single day.

17:14.910 --> 17:18.027
I mean, you don’t need me
for that insight. Ask anybody.

17:18.121 --> 17:22.660
He holds himselfseparate
from the congregation.
What do you think that means?

17:22.792 --> 17:26.910
How long have you been a member
ofthe Inclusion Church?
Ijoined about six months ago.

17:27.005 --> 17:30.088
Oh. He’s a latecomer
to the church, huh?

17:30.175 --> 17:33.087
- That’s a good one.
- Thank you.

17:33.178 --> 17:34.714
For sharing that.

17:34.804 --> 17:37.216
Why would anybody lie about
when theyjoined a church?

17:37.349 --> 17:40.307
So what brought you
to the church?
I had a drinking problem...

17:40.393 --> 17:43.681
which gave me problems
with the law, which gave me
marital problems.

17:43.772 --> 17:46.434
You served two years,
less a day, for assault.

17:46.524 --> 17:51.393
When I got out ofjail,
I wanted my wife back.
I wanted my life back.

17:51.488 --> 17:55.231
Uh, it doesn’t look like
things are goin’ so great
with the wife.

17:55.325 --> 17:58.488
Are you livin’
with your wife again?

17:58.578 --> 18:02.912
I got a ways to go
before Rita trusts me
whole-hog, you know, and—

18:02.999 --> 18:06.412
Plus, she’s not that excited
about the religious aspect.

18:06.503 --> 18:09.540
Why is the FBI. interested
in the pastor drowning?

18:09.631 --> 18:12.714
Oh, there’s more than one way
for a person to drown.

18:14.177 --> 18:16.839
Do you always
call her “pastor”?
What else would I call her?

18:16.972 --> 18:21.090
[Switch Clicks]
[J.P. On Tape]
Hey, it’sJ.P. again.

18:21.184 --> 18:23.470
I’m sorry.
|-I miss you.

18:23.561 --> 18:26.598
/need to see you.
It’s important.

18:26.690 --> 18:30.433
/ really need you, Patty.
Please call. Please.

18:30.527 --> 18:33.940
You got It all wrong.
That call is not
what you ’re thinking

18:34.030 --> 18:35.941
/ was call/n ’ the pastor
about Rita.

18:36.074 --> 18:38.531
[Booth]
Real/y?
Oh. H-Hold on a minute.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.904
Look at the last photo.
He knew.

18:40.996 --> 18:43.783
- You can’t tell that from a photo.
- Beg your pardon?

18:43.873 --> 18:46.785
I can. He knew
that she used to be a man.

18:46.876 --> 18:50.960
That doesn’t show
in the photographs.
You know what I’m saying?

18:51.047 --> 18:54.335
- About what Patricia was before?
- I told you he knew.

18:54.426 --> 18:57.668
What was your reaction when you
found out that Pastor Patricia
wasn’t a real woman?

18:57.762 --> 19:00.344
Don’t say Patty
wasn’t a real woman.
It makes you sound ignorant.

19:00.432 --> 19:03.094
The pastor came between
you and your wife,
but she was livin’ a lie.

19:03.184 --> 19:07.598
You lost your manhood
and your religion all in one go.
Or did prison widen your tastes?

19:07.689 --> 19:11.102
You’rejust pretending
to be a jerk to get a rise
out ofthis guy, right?

19:11.192 --> 19:13.649
I didn’t want to develop
feelings for Patricia,
but I did.

19:13.737 --> 19:16.023
That didn’t change when she
told me who she used to be.

19:16.114 --> 19:19.902
- Who’d she use to be?
- What do you want, a name?
I don’t know. I never asked.

19:19.993 --> 19:22.655
Can’t you look it up
on some legal name-change form?

19:22.746 --> 19:27.331
/f you would’ve ever met Patty,
you’d know what / know,
what God knows, what she knew.

19:27.417 --> 19:30.830
- She was not a man.
- [Ange/a]
Yeah.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.457
I’m with him on this one,
Booth.

19:41.598 --> 19:45.432
Bone marrow and liver remnants
contain high concentrations
of ethinyl estradiol,

19:45.518 --> 19:49.261
medroxyprogesterone acetate
and sprirono/actone,
which is an anti-androgen.

19:49.356 --> 19:52.894
- Hormone replacement therapy.
- Very healthy bone mass.

19:52.984 --> 19:55.441
High percentages
of calcium and vitamin “.’D’

19:55.528 --> 19:57.860
- Which indicates?
- A health nut.

19:57.947 --> 20:02.737
Tox screen shows Stamaril,
Havrix monodose and Engerix—B.

20:02.827 --> 20:06.194
- Vaccinations?
- Yellow fever,
Hep “A” and Hep “.”B

20:06.289 --> 20:08.405
All necessary for traveling
to the Far East.

20:08.500 --> 20:12.459
Did you know
that only 20% ofAmericans
ha ve passports?

20:14.714 --> 20:16.875
That’s not irrelevant. It—
[Stammers]

20:16.966 --> 20:20.424
Perhaps that’s why there’s
no record ofthis guy—
[Stammers]

20:22.847 --> 20:25.839
It could’ve happened in,
you know, Thailand.

20:26.851 --> 20:28.933
Very good,
Mr. Nigel-Murray.

20:29.020 --> 20:32.888
Though conjecture is not really
what we do here in the lab,

20:32.982 --> 20:34.847
50—

20:37.529 --> 20:41.317
But... very good— [Quietly]
Mr. Nigel-Murray.

20:45.203 --> 20:49.037
May I ask you something?
Oh, God.
Is there any way to say no?

20:49.124 --> 20:52.457
Whatever happened
to whoever it was who used
to work here before me?

20:52.544 --> 20:54.876
Hejoined forces
with a serial killer...

20:54.963 --> 20:57.170
who was the last in a long line
of cannibalistic murderers...

20:57.257 --> 20:59.498
specializing in knocking off
members of secret societies...

20:59.592 --> 21:01.844
and building skeletons
out oftheir body parts.

21:04.347 --> 21:07.839
Wow. I—| hope
that doesn’t happen to me.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.851
So he—
he’s not coming back?

21:13.398 --> 21:17.232
No. He’s locked up
for the rest of his life.

21:18.319 --> 21:21.106
- But we all still like him.
- Excuse me.

21:21.197 --> 21:24.530
Mmm. Hello, hello, hello.

21:24.617 --> 21:27.279
Are you familiar with
the expression, “That’s way
too much car for you”?

21:27.370 --> 21:30.703
I believe that’s one ofours
actually. So, yes.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.372
Hey.

21:33.460 --> 21:37.248
- I wanna show you something.
- I want to show you something.

21:37.338 --> 21:41.047
Vroom, vroom, kid.
You’re already
in my rearview mirror.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.751
[Angela]
Booth said the FBI.
couldn’t find any record...

21:44.846 --> 21:46.802
ofan official name change
or anything showing...

21:46.890 --> 21:50.053
who Patricia Ludmuller was
before the sex-change operation.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.634
It’s possible she had her
surgery done in the Far East.

21:52.729 --> 21:57.598
In England
the Speaker of the House
is not allowed to speak

21:58.776 --> 22:01.267
Anyway, what I did was—

22:01.362 --> 22:06.072
- Here she is as a woman.
- Hmm, not bad.

22:06.159 --> 22:09.617
I mean—I mean, th-the sketch.
It— Okay? Mm-hmm.

22:09.704 --> 22:12.411
Here I made her
more masculine.

22:12.499 --> 22:15.115
I made the bony prominences
more robust,

22:15.210 --> 22:18.794
Increased the size
of the mastoid processes
and the nucha/ crests.

22:18.880 --> 22:21.371
Seldom seen
bigger nuchal crests.

22:21.466 --> 22:24.333
It doesn’t look like anybody
you recognize?

22:25.512 --> 22:29.096
- Should it?
- I also added facial hair.

22:29.182 --> 22:31.093
Do you recognize him now?

22:31.184 --> 22:34.893
- It’s that guy.
- Oh, “Evil spirits, come out.”

22:34.979 --> 22:37.061
That’s exactly what I thought.

22:37.148 --> 22:39.935
[Man ]
Yes, God makes demands of us.

22:41.027 --> 22:45.896
This money
belongs to God, not me!

22:45.990 --> 22:50.984
Who willjoin me in giving God
what is rightfully his?

22:51.079 --> 22:55.038
He is ask/ng you now,
at this moment

22:55.124 --> 23:00.585
What is your answer?
What is your answer to God
when he calls your name?

23:00.672 --> 23:03.459
Willyou deny him?

23:03.550 --> 23:05.757
[Beeps]
[Switches Off]

23:05.885 --> 23:09.218
Pastor Patrick
Stephenson.
Disappeared six years ago.

23:09.305 --> 23:11.341
Oh! Wow,
I got it right.

23:11.432 --> 23:15.016
He disappeared from,
uh, Vietnam or Thailand—
one ofthose places.

23:15.103 --> 23:18.846
Yeah, on a world tour.
His followers said
he was the first of many...

23:18.940 --> 23:21.022
who’d be taken up
in the Rapture.

23:21.109 --> 23:24.977
So that guy went from that
to being a woman pastor...

23:25.071 --> 23:27.107
in a cottage
on Chesapeake Bay?

23:27.198 --> 23:29.109
Hey, some people
would call that heaven.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.907
Amazing job, Angela.

23:31.995 --> 23:34.031
Yeah, well, check this out.

23:37.709 --> 23:40.451
- [Remote Beeps]
- She had a wife and son...

23:40.545 --> 23:44.629
before she gave up being a he.
[Chuckles]

23:44.716 --> 23:46.672
[Sighs]

23:48.511 --> 23:52.174
The Thai federal police
were certaIn that Patrick
had been robbed and killed

23:52.265 --> 23:56.178
Yeah, well, uh,
it’s a lot to absorb.

23:57.687 --> 24:01.851
A sex-change operation
in Bangkok, Thailand,
costs about $25,000.

24:03.693 --> 24:06.560
You want me to believe
that Patrick stole money...

24:06.654 --> 24:09.566
and then had himself
transformed into a woman?

24:09.657 --> 24:12.034
- It’s a scenario.
- Patrick was a religious man.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.951
He would never offend God
in this blatant manner.

24:15.038 --> 24:17.279
The theft, you mean,
because it’s a sin.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.910
A sex-change operation.

24:20.001 --> 24:24.370
We are made in God’s image,
Dr. Brennan. Who are we
to alter that image?

24:24.464 --> 24:26.455
[Chuckles]
Obviously you dye your hair.

24:26.549 --> 24:29.256
- There’s evidence of plastic surgery.
- That’s different.

24:29.344 --> 24:31.050
- Bones.
- How?

24:31.137 --> 24:36.677
I-It’s augmenting God’s work,
not undoing it completely.
How about that, Bones?

24:40.396 --> 24:42.773
Uh, we have a DNA. match
between your husband...

24:42.857 --> 24:44.973
and the deceased female
found in the Chesapeake Bay.

24:45.068 --> 24:48.060
- Do these people believe in DNA?
- Look. It seems as though...

24:48.154 --> 24:52.022
your husband sent a check
made out to the church
every month.

24:52.158 --> 24:55.150
A hundred dollars a month?
Mm-hmm.

24:55.244 --> 24:57.826
So Patrick was repaying us
for the money he took?

24:57.914 --> 25:01.077
Actually, it’s more accurate
to say that Patricia...

25:01.167 --> 25:04.079
was repaying you
for the money
that Patrick took.

25:04.170 --> 25:07.082
During these intervening years,
did your husband ever by
to contact you?

25:07.173 --> 25:10.586
No. /be/ie ved the Thai police
when they declared Patrick dead

25:10.718 --> 25:13.926
And your son?
Ryan would have told me
if he’d heard from his father.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.345
Oh, we’re gonna have
to talk to him.

25:16.432 --> 25:19.765
Last I heard,
he was in California.

25:21.229 --> 25:23.220
[Sighs]

25:23.314 --> 25:26.181
After his father vanished,

25:26.275 --> 25:29.142
Ryan took over
preaching the word of God
to our ﬂock...

25:30.697 --> 25:34.235
for about a year— then he had
a crisis of faith and left.

25:34.325 --> 25:36.657
Ryan is still in the throes
ofthat crisis.

25:36.744 --> 25:41.158
I have faith that,
in the fullness oftime,
God will lead Ryan back to us.

25:41.290 --> 25:44.373
Before your husband—
Became a woman?

25:44.460 --> 25:46.667
disappeared,

25:46.754 --> 25:50.042
did he have any reason
to fear for his life?

25:50.133 --> 25:53.170
A man named Arthur Ford
was arrested for assaulting Patrick.

25:53.302 --> 25:56.886
Why did he assault
your husband?
He had a son.

25:56.973 --> 26:00.181
The boy donated
his entire trust fund
to the church.

26:00.268 --> 26:04.102
His father thought
that we’d brainwashed him
or some such nonsense.

26:04.188 --> 26:06.349
Did you give the money back?

26:06.441 --> 26:09.558
The boy wasn’t brainwashed,
Dr. Brennan.

26:09.652 --> 26:11.768
The Lord touched him.

26:11.863 --> 26:15.481
Exactly how much money
did the Lord touch him for?

26:16.826 --> 26:19.693
Five million dollars?
Great. Thank you.

26:19.787 --> 26:23.700
Five million is a ton of moola,
but Arthur Ford is not
a good suspect.

26:23.791 --> 26:28.034
Why? What with the ton of moola
they practically stole from his son.

26:28.129 --> 26:31.667
That phone call Ijust had—
Arthur Ford died of pancreatic
cancer three years ago.

26:31.799 --> 26:34.336
Oh.
Yeah, “oh.”

26:35.428 --> 26:37.510
Do you think she loved
her husband?
Who?

26:37.638 --> 26:41.506
Mrs. Stephenson.
Well, I don’t know,
but she was plenty angry at him.

26:41.642 --> 26:44.554
For getting
the sex-change operation?
No, no, no. Before that.

26:44.645 --> 26:48.137
I mean, she only called him
by his given name or referred
to him as “Ryan’s father”—

26:48.232 --> 26:50.188
never, you know,
“my husband.”

26:51.569 --> 26:54.026
I call you “Booth,”
and I like you just fine.
Thank you,

26:54.113 --> 26:56.525
but we’re not married.

26:56.616 --> 27:00.325
One angry father
might be dead, but, uh,
maybe there are more.

27:00.411 --> 27:04.120
But Patrick Stephenson
wasn’t murdered.
Patricia Ludmuller was.

27:04.207 --> 27:08.120
You think the moment Patricia
Ludmuller came to exist,
Patrick Stephenson stopped?

27:08.211 --> 27:11.374
When the butterfly emerges,
does the caterpillar cease to exist?

27:11.464 --> 27:14.126
Okay, what are you, like,
some kind of kung fu master?

27:14.217 --> 27:18.210
Why don’t wejust figure out
who killed this guy—

27:18.304 --> 27:22.092
gal— person, okay?

27:22.225 --> 27:25.717
Would you like mejust as much
ifl were a man?
Oh, yeah. Much better.

27:25.812 --> 27:28.599
Wouldn’t have to be
so polite and accommodating.

27:28.689 --> 27:31.396
How about you?
Would you like me...
better ifl was a woman?

27:31.526 --> 27:34.814
No. I would not.
Why?

27:34.946 --> 27:38.905
I’d bejealous that you might be
prettier than I am.
I would be too.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.448
I’d be hot—
smokin’ hot.

27:47.667 --> 27:51.785
[Man On Speaker]
They are not “gay.”
They are not “homosexual.”

27:51.879 --> 27:56.794
They are abominations unto the Lord.
They are sodomites—

27:56.926 --> 28:00.259
[Continues]
This kid
is Patrick Stephenson’s son?

28:00.346 --> 28:03.304
It would explain
why Patrick Stephenson chose
to disappear the way he did.

28:03.391 --> 28:06.178
Unashamed,
they performed deeds...

28:06.269 --> 28:08.806
that led them into the hands
ofan angry God.

28:08.896 --> 28:12.514
Now this is a fairly
well—known moment, even though
it was never televised. Watch.

28:12.608 --> 28:14.860
It is this ignorance
to the light ofGod...

28:14.944 --> 28:17.481
that led to their doom.

28:22.243 --> 28:24.234
I can’t do this anymore.

28:25.830 --> 28:30.324
I can’t. I preach
against sins, sins I hate,

28:30.418 --> 28:32.750
but other sins,
such as greed—

28:35.047 --> 28:37.129
[Quietly]
Greed.

28:38.301 --> 28:42.465
This is a palace,
and I am a prince.

28:43.556 --> 28:46.514
I am not like my father.

28:46.601 --> 28:48.808
And / am not like my mother.

28:50.646 --> 28:53.604
| just want to do God’s work—

28:54.650 --> 28:57.141
not perform on television,

28:58.321 --> 29:01.654
bilk you for your money.
[Congregation Murmurs]

29:01.741 --> 29:03.732
God bless us all.

29:05.411 --> 29:08.995
God forgive us all.
[Congregation Continues
Murmuring, Whispering]

29:11.667 --> 29:16.001
- [Whistles]
- Ironically, he was
just like his father.

29:16.088 --> 29:19.330
- You think he switched sexes too?
- No, no.

29:19.425 --> 29:23.134
They both turned their backs
on this kind of, uh,
commercial worship.

29:23.220 --> 29:25.677
They both went out
into the world looking
for redemption.

29:25.806 --> 29:28.764
I assume you’re gonna
search out Ryan Stephenson.
I work at the FBI.

29:28.851 --> 29:32.184
That’s what we do.
It’s a big country, and we’ll try.

29:32.271 --> 29:35.354
Well, concentrate
your search in hospitals,
halfway houses,

29:35.441 --> 29:37.682
uh, rehab centers,jails.

29:37.777 --> 29:39.813
You think things have gone
that badly for him?

29:39.904 --> 29:42.065
No, no.
He’s not an inmate
or a patient.

29:42.156 --> 29:45.489
Ryan Stephenson
is literally atoning
for the sins of his father.

29:45.576 --> 29:50.195
He left the palace
for the street. He’s following
the teachings ofjesus.

29:50.331 --> 29:52.492
His mother says
he’s in California.
No, she’s wrong.

29:52.583 --> 29:55.495
This kid—
he’s the Prodigal Son.

29:55.586 --> 29:59.829
I’ll bet he’s within 20 miles
ofthat giant church he fled
as a confused adolescent.

29:59.924 --> 30:02.210
- I’ll take that bet.
- All right. How much?

30:02.343 --> 30:04.254
Twenty bucks.
Deal.

30:04.345 --> 30:08.008
- Deal. Shh. 20 dollars.
- Oh. Thank you.

30:08.140 --> 30:10.051
Here you go.
Thank you.

30:11.894 --> 30:14.180
Ifyou’re making the wager,
how come I get the money?

30:14.271 --> 30:16.432
- You’re the bank.
- You’re the bank, lady.

30:19.318 --> 30:23.982
This comminuted ﬁ‘acture
on the pelvis is ver sImi/ar
to the blow to the skull.

30:24.073 --> 30:27.736
Both blows were inflicted
while Patricia Ludmuller
was still alive.

30:27.827 --> 30:31.319
She was swimming.
She was struck on the head.
She drowned.

30:31.414 --> 30:34.872
Then how were
her fingers damaged
and how was she cut in half?

30:34.959 --> 30:39.043
Ah. Wow. You ask
extremely difficult questions.

30:39.130 --> 30:42.122
The particulates found
about the skull wound
and the pelvis...

30:42.216 --> 30:46.175
are ﬁber-reinforced polymers
and hydrocarbon secretion
of coniferous trees.

30:46.262 --> 30:48.878
Which is what exactly?

30:49.015 --> 30:51.927
Fiberglass and resin.
Okay.
She was struck by a boat—

30:52.018 --> 30:53.929
the keel of a boat.

30:54.020 --> 30:57.262
Now we’re getting somewhere.
Anything on the metacarpals?

30:57.356 --> 30:59.768
You mean, could I tell
what hit her fingers? No.

30:59.859 --> 31:02.817
/t was eIther something that
didn ’t leave traces, or water
rubbed a way all the evidence.

31:02.945 --> 31:05.482
We’ll show these images
to Dr. Brennan.
Why?

31:05.614 --> 31:09.106
’Cause she’ll see something
you missed.
Some—

31:14.707 --> 31:17.198
[Chattering]

31:27.970 --> 31:31.929
So that’s Ryan Stephenson?
Yep. Found him in a detox center
in Silver Spring.

31:32.058 --> 31:34.424
A patient?
Nope. Counselor.
You called it.

31:34.518 --> 31:36.634
- You owe me 20 bucks.
- Get it from Bones.

31:38.064 --> 31:41.898
- Are you sure it was my father?
- Yes. We’re positive.

31:43.110 --> 31:46.318
[Exhales]
They told me
Dad died in Thailand.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.896
Well, he, um—
Well, she...

31:48.991 --> 31:52.654
seemed to have found peace
up there on the island.

31:52.787 --> 31:55.995
Named his church
“Inclusion”?
Yeah.

31:56.082 --> 32:00.371
He welcomed drug addicts,
prostitutes, homosexuals?

32:00.461 --> 32:03.453
Oh, according
to her congregation
who loved her,

32:03.547 --> 32:05.503
your father
welcomed everyone.

32:09.220 --> 32:11.927
What?
You afraid your father’s
gonna burn in hell?

32:12.014 --> 32:14.130
No.
[Chuckles]

32:16.685 --> 32:19.097
No, Ijust wish
I had the... chance—

32:19.188 --> 32:21.349
[Voice Breaking]
to know the new him—

32:21.440 --> 32:23.021
her.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.822
I’m a suspect?

32:28.906 --> 32:32.364
You thought, perhaps,
/ found out my father was
a fraud who had a seX change,

32:32.451 --> 32:34.362
and then God asked me
to kill him?

32:34.453 --> 32:37.490
Did God tell you
to kill your dad?

32:43.546 --> 32:45.377
I’ve changed.

32:47.049 --> 32:51.008
Do you believe
in redemption?
Yes, I do.

32:54.890 --> 32:58.678
One ofGod’s challenges to us
is to see past the surface...

33:04.525 --> 33:09.269
to the deeper, essential nature...
which lies right beneath.

33:09.363 --> 33:11.479
You believe our bodies
are like dust covers?

33:11.574 --> 33:14.862
That’s exactly what I think,
Agent Booth.

33:14.952 --> 33:18.319
Rip ’em off
and see what’s underneath.

33:18.414 --> 33:22.407
You see, all this time
I thought my father was killed
or had abandoned me,

33:22.501 --> 33:24.958
and that’sjust not
what happened.

33:25.045 --> 33:28.003
He didn’t want
to shake my faith.

33:28.090 --> 33:30.376
He was protecting me
from the truth. He—

33:30.467 --> 33:34.881
He didn’t want me to have
to choose between him and God,
a-and I love my father forthat.

33:36.390 --> 33:40.759
Ijust hope God can forgive me
for making him feel that way.

33:45.107 --> 33:47.473
Do you think I could have
my father’s Bible?

33:47.568 --> 33:50.480
I’m afraid it’s still evidence.

33:50.571 --> 33:55.190
But hey, we figure out
who killed your father,
we’ll make sure you get that.

33:55.284 --> 33:57.696
Thank you.

33:57.786 --> 34:00.573
You ever consider returning
to the ministry, Ryan?

34:09.006 --> 34:11.748
[Beeps]

34:11.842 --> 34:15.334
Okay. So we know
Patricia Ludmuller
was run over by a boat.

34:15.429 --> 34:18.967
The boat struck her
in two places: the skull
and the pelvic bone.

34:19.058 --> 34:21.299
We found traces of enamel paInt
and stain ﬁller—

34:21.393 --> 34:25.352
specifically,
Silver Neptune Mahogany—
and lead red primer.

34:25.439 --> 34:29.398
It was a foggy day,
she was out there
swimming alone—

34:29.485 --> 34:31.771
- This death could’ve been accidental.
- Or hit-and-run.

34:31.904 --> 34:36.318
No. It was murder.
Only one percent of deaths
are murders.

34:36.408 --> 34:39.445
Hodgins, you found pieces
ofsplintered wood
from the keel...

34:39.536 --> 34:41.447
both in the skull
and the pelvic bone.

34:41.538 --> 34:44.826
Yeah, from a wooden—keeled,
shallow-hulled speedboat.

34:44.917 --> 34:48.626
The splinters
are embedded In the skull
from this direction.

34:48.712 --> 34:51.124
- Struck from behind.
- And in the pelvic bone...

34:51.215 --> 34:53.706
from this direction
at a 90-degree angle.

34:53.801 --> 34:56.167
The boat hit her skull
from behind...

34:56.262 --> 34:58.503
while she was facedown
in the water.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.553
The second blow
hit her from the side,

35:00.641 --> 35:02.552
and she was on her back
in the water.

35:02.643 --> 35:06.010
She was struck once.
Then the boat turned around
to make sure she was dead

35:06.105 --> 35:08.141
Then hurt, disoriented

35:08.232 --> 35:11.599
she reached up
to clasp the gunwale?

35:11.694 --> 35:14.436
Someone smashed her fingers,
forcing her to let go.

35:14.530 --> 35:19.445
- Then she floated on her back.
- The boat left,
then turned around and...

35:19.535 --> 35:21.947
struck her again.
[Beeping]

35:24.665 --> 35:29.750
Booth? We know exactly
how Patricia Ludmuller
was murdered.

35:36.427 --> 35:38.918
Excuse me,
Dr. Saroyan.
Yes, Vincent.

35:39.013 --> 35:42.096
I-Is there a way
to quit working here...

35:42.182 --> 35:44.889
without losing Dr. Brennan
as my grad supervisor?

35:44.977 --> 35:47.263
Ah, I see.
You’d like to quit this internship...

35:47.354 --> 35:49.219
without losing
your academic standing.

35:49.356 --> 35:52.268
Yeah.
[Sighs]
Can I ask why?

35:52.359 --> 35:54.850
It’s absolutely impossible
to kiss your own elbow.

35:54.945 --> 35:59.735
- And how is that relevant?
- It isn’t, Dr. Saroyan, but, um—

35:59.825 --> 36:01.736
I’m someone
who loves knowledge,

36:01.827 --> 36:04.910
and all ofyou are
very narrowly focused.

36:04.997 --> 36:08.615
I-I-It’s a good focus, I know—
catching murderers—

36:08.709 --> 36:12.952
but, um, all in all,
I’d rather be like me
than like you.

36:13.047 --> 36:15.288
So ifyou can help me out—

36:15.382 --> 36:18.124
I’ll take care ofit
with Dr. Brennan.

36:18.218 --> 36:20.425
We’ll move on to another intern.

36:21.513 --> 36:24.095
Did you know
that over 98% of people...

36:24.183 --> 36:27.391
will respond with “Thank you”
ifyou say, “You’re welcome”?

36:27.478 --> 36:29.560
- You’re welcome—
- Thank you.

36:31.774 --> 36:33.139
Vino Delectable.

36:45.287 --> 36:48.779
Based on size, wood grain
and shape of the keel,

36:48.874 --> 36:52.708
Hodgins and Angela
narrowed our search down
to two models.

36:52.795 --> 36:57.585
Oh, so it’s a t ee Shore Island
and a Bow Wave Runabout Okay

36:57.674 --> 37:00.336
So how’d she end up
split in two?

37:00.469 --> 37:03.961
You mean, how did a man
become a woman?
No, her spine was severed.

37:04.056 --> 37:07.219
Oh, the polymer Hodgins found
was probably fishing line.

37:07.309 --> 37:10.893
So she sinks, decomposes,

37:10.979 --> 37:13.516
and the fishing line
severs the spinal column.

37:13.607 --> 37:17.099
Ah, some fisherman thinks
a big one got away.

37:17.194 --> 37:20.607
You think it means anything?
I mean, she lives her life
split in two,

37:20.697 --> 37:23.109
then in death,
split in two again.

37:24.993 --> 37:27.951
No. I don’t think
it means anything.
I didn’t think you would.

38:20.716 --> 38:23.002
Check this out, Bones, huh?

38:23.093 --> 38:25.300
He ’5 got a wirIng harness
under there.

38:25.387 --> 38:28.800
Bench seats
with marine vinyl seat cushions.
This isjust classic.

38:28.891 --> 38:30.927
- How long have you had this for?
- Years.

38:31.018 --> 38:33.555
I only started restoring it
after I joined the church.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.351
The pastor said
it’d be a good project for me.

38:35.439 --> 38:39.057
- Did you take it out the day
Patricia Ludmuller disappeared?
- No.

38:39.151 --> 38:41.893
- This is definitely the boat
that struck Patricia Ludmuller.
- What?

38:41.987 --> 38:45.275
- Twice.
- Couldn’t deal with the rejection,j.P.?

38:45.365 --> 38:47.856
Our psychological expert says
that many men freak out when...

38:47.951 --> 38:50.658
they fInd the woman
they’ve been sleep/ng with

38:50.746 --> 38:52.452
We never slept together.

38:52.539 --> 38:56.031
/ wanted to.
/ wanted her. She wanted me.

38:56.126 --> 38:59.368
- But she refused. I’m still married.
- That why you ran her down?

38:59.463 --> 39:02.830
- That’s where you smashed her hand
- No! Stop saying these things.

39:02.925 --> 39:06.417
She must have been In a lot
of pain when she grabbed
the sIde of the boat.

39:06.553 --> 39:10.421
I’m sure we’ll find what he used
to smash her fingers right here
in the boat.
Ow.

39:12.226 --> 39:14.558
My guess is this.

39:14.645 --> 39:19.014
Bones, these seats— the y—
they aren ’t aojustab/e.
How tall do you think ].P. is?

39:19.107 --> 39:21.439
190 to 195 centimeters.

39:21.527 --> 39:25.065

39:31.245 --> 39:33.987
J.P., you didn’t restore this boat
for yourself, did you?

39:34.081 --> 39:39.201
Pastor Patricia said I should do
something for someone else—
someone I love.

39:39.294 --> 39:41.455
Then you should’ve
built it for her.

39:42.839 --> 39:45.626

for you to get tired

39:52.015 --> 39:54.472
And all you did was fall in love
with another woman.

39:54.560 --> 39:58.394
- I never slept with her, Rita.
- I don’t believe that.

39:58.480 --> 40:00.436
