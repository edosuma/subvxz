00:46.021 --> 00:47.523
<i>Let's break it down. </i>

00:49.692 --> 00:51.985
Hydrogen. What does that give us?

00:52.194 --> 00:54.988
By mole, we're looking at 63 percent.

00:55.197 --> 00:57.282
Sixty-three?

00:57.491 --> 00:58.909
That is a big bite.

00:59.118 --> 01:02.246
- My next step's gotta be oxygen.
- Oxygen, 26 percent.

01:02.454 --> 01:04.623
Twenty-six.
There you have your water.

01:04.831 --> 01:08.210
- Carbon, 9 percent.
- Carbon, 9.

01:08.419 --> 01:11.338
- For a total of 98 percent.
- Right.

01:11.547 --> 01:15.801
- Nitrogen, 1.25 percent.
- One-point-two-five.

01:16.009 --> 01:18.303
That brings you to 99 and a quarter.

01:18.512 --> 01:21.473
Which only leaves you
with the trace elements...

01:21.682 --> 01:24.226
...down where the magic happens.

01:24.435 --> 01:28.188
Oh, wait a minute. What about calcium?
Calcium's not a trace.

01:28.397 --> 01:30.190
Got a whole skeleton to account for.

01:30.399 --> 01:32.067
- You would think, right?
- Right.

01:32.276 --> 01:35.821
Calcium.
Calcium's only 0.25 percent.

01:36.321 --> 01:40.743
What? That low? Seriously?

01:40.951 --> 01:42.661
Damn, I never would've thought that.

01:42.870 --> 01:47.666
- Okay, so where does iron fit in?
- Iron.

01:47.875 --> 01:54.715
Well, okay, 0.00004 percent.

01:55.049 --> 01:58.802
What? You can't have
haemoglobin without iron.

01:59.011 --> 02:01.847
- Apparently, it don't take much.
- No doubt. Go figure.

02:02.056 --> 02:05.893
- Sodium.
- Sodium, 0.04.

02:07.895 --> 02:12.816
- Phosphorus, 0.19.
- Point-one-nine.

02:13.525 --> 02:14.943
There we go.

02:15.444 --> 02:18.947
So the whole thing...

02:19.156 --> 02:25.579
...adds up to 99.888042 percent.

02:28.290 --> 02:33.629
We are 0.111958 percent...

02:34.671 --> 02:35.964
...shy.

02:36.173 --> 02:39.802
- Supposedly, that's everything.
- Yeah?

02:41.595 --> 02:42.971
I don't know, I just...

02:44.598 --> 02:46.725
It seems like something's missing,
doesn't it?

02:49.269 --> 02:52.981
There's got to be more
to a human being than that.

03:24.430 --> 03:26.056
I hate these shoes.

03:26.265 --> 03:28.976
Shoes make me look like
I should be changing bedpans...

03:29.184 --> 03:31.020
...like I should be squeaking around...

03:31.228 --> 03:33.814
...bringing soup to some
disgusting old person...

03:34.023 --> 03:35.983
...then take the bus home
to my 16 cats.

03:36.191 --> 03:38.402
Then why are you wearing them?

03:39.528 --> 03:42.906
I like the support. My arches
happen to be extremely archy.

03:46.076 --> 03:51.707
Yo, what's up? Hey, can you call me,
like, in two minutes? Thanks, bye.

03:53.584 --> 03:55.794
I gotta go take this.

03:56.795 --> 03:58.505
Female?

03:59.882 --> 04:01.759
Louis.

04:01.967 --> 04:05.429
Not like it's any
of your business, though.

04:05.637 --> 04:07.598
- Just be quick about it.
- No.

04:07.806 --> 04:12.186
Oh, and please don't say, "Yo. "

04:12.394 --> 04:15.147
You can't know how much I hate that.

04:20.319 --> 04:23.947
You missed a spot, right there.

04:24.448 --> 04:25.824
Should you be on that ladder?

04:26.033 --> 04:28.494
You're more than welcome
to take over for me in here.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.913
I don't see why you don't get
Walt to do it.

04:31.372 --> 04:34.333
Yeah, there's an idea.

04:36.418 --> 04:39.338
So I'm working on
this new short story...

04:39.546 --> 04:44.134
...and there's this stoner character in it
and I'm trying to...

04:45.427 --> 04:47.554
Well, you know, actually,
let me back up.

04:47.763 --> 04:53.310
You smoked your fair share of pot
in college, didn't you?

04:55.187 --> 04:58.065
I mean, you at least tried it.

05:00.109 --> 05:01.985
Come on.

05:03.946 --> 05:07.991
I perhaps tried it. Why?

05:08.200 --> 05:10.494
Do you remember it
having an effect on your mood?

05:10.703 --> 05:12.788
Like, changing it in any major way?

05:13.414 --> 05:15.624
It made me more serious.

05:15.833 --> 05:17.501
Really?

05:17.710 --> 05:23.006
Because I mostly remember it made me
light-headed, that's about it.

05:23.799 --> 05:27.970
I was just wondering
if it maybe could...

05:30.889 --> 05:35.310
You know, it's just a character thing
I'm stuck on. Never mind.

05:35.519 --> 05:38.605
- Walter Jr. 's on pot?
- What? No.

05:38.814 --> 05:40.482
No. No.

05:40.691 --> 05:43.235
- What would make you even...?
- Where's he getting it?

05:43.444 --> 05:46.905
- Marie.
- Seriously. Is it this Louis person?

05:47.322 --> 05:51.452
- What are you gonna do about this?
- Marie, you need to look me in the eye.

05:51.660 --> 05:55.539
I am strictly asking about a story
that I'm writing, that's all.

05:56.165 --> 06:00.294
Right hand to God,
Walter Jr. Is not on pot...

06:00.502 --> 06:03.338
...certainly not as far as I know.

06:04.048 --> 06:06.008
Not as far as you know?

06:06.508 --> 06:08.093
Marie.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.119
Hey, look at me.

07:58.787 --> 08:00.914
Hey, turn around and look at me.

08:05.627 --> 08:09.339
This here.

08:09.965 --> 08:12.509
I wouldn't do this
to my worst enemy.

08:14.636 --> 08:16.472
This is degrading.

08:21.226 --> 08:22.895
I'm sorry.

08:23.812 --> 08:26.940
You hope I'll make it easy
and just drop dead, don't you?

08:28.484 --> 08:30.235
But I won't.

08:30.444 --> 08:32.863
So either kill me, or let me go.

08:34.198 --> 08:36.658
You don't have it in you, Walter.

08:40.703 --> 08:42.456
How do you know my name?

08:43.916 --> 08:48.045
Jesse. He told Emilio and me.

08:48.921 --> 08:51.340
I came by to sell your meth.

08:52.758 --> 08:56.011
So what? You threaten him, huh?
Did you beat it out of him?

08:56.220 --> 08:58.222
Not even close.

09:01.934 --> 09:03.977
What else did he tell you?

09:05.479 --> 09:08.107
Pretty much everything
he could think of.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.567
You were his high school teacher.

09:10.776 --> 09:12.778
One time you taught
about carbon dioxide...

09:12.986 --> 09:15.531
...by making grape soda in class.

09:16.281 --> 09:19.993
You have a son who's retarded,
or in a wheelchair or something.

09:22.496 --> 09:25.457
It shouldn't come across
as some news flash.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.835
That partner of yours...

09:28.043 --> 09:29.169
...he's got a big mouth.

09:31.046 --> 09:32.715
Walter...

09:32.923 --> 09:35.384
...I don't know what you think
you're doing here...

09:35.592 --> 09:37.261
...but trust me...

09:38.053 --> 09:40.597
...this line of work doesn't suit you.

09:42.516 --> 09:45.936
So I should just let you go, then.

09:46.145 --> 09:50.649
Just unlock you and... adiÃ³s, huh?

09:51.150 --> 09:53.610
I don't see
what other choice you have.

09:53.819 --> 09:56.655
It's between that
and cold-blooded murder.

09:57.448 --> 09:58.907
Besides...

10:00.117 --> 10:02.077
...your real problem's
sitting upstairs.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.140
Occupied.

10:23.766 --> 10:26.352
Hey, yo, I'm trying to pinch one off
in here.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.604
Just give me some privacy,
would you?

10:31.940 --> 10:34.526
- Okay.
- What the hell, man?

10:35.611 --> 10:37.404
What are you doing, man?

10:37.613 --> 10:39.865
- You asshole. What...?
- You told him my name.

10:40.074 --> 10:42.159
- Says who, him?
- My name, where I work.

10:42.368 --> 10:44.745
- You told him about my son.
- Hey, don't touch me.

10:44.953 --> 10:47.539
- You damn junkie.
- No, give me that. That's mine.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.875
This is going down the toilet.
Watch it go.

10:50.084 --> 10:51.585
No, that's worth 40 grand, you...

10:51.794 --> 10:54.505
It's worth nothing
when you smoke it all.

10:54.713 --> 10:56.673
Get off the toilet.

10:56.882 --> 10:58.675
- Get off the toilet!
- No.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.806
Get off the toilet.

11:04.139 --> 11:06.266
Stop it.

11:09.645 --> 11:11.021
No. No way.

11:45.556 --> 11:46.807
No.

11:47.016 --> 11:48.976
No, no, no.

11:49.184 --> 11:51.729
Jesse, where the hell do you think
you're going?

11:51.937 --> 11:53.272
Back off, man, Jesus.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.940
- We've got work to do.
- No, no.

11:55.149 --> 11:57.651
You got work to do. I did my part.

11:57.860 --> 12:00.320
You mean that obscenity
I spent hours cleaning up?

12:00.529 --> 12:03.407
- That is your contribution?
- Kiss my pink ass, man.

12:03.615 --> 12:06.910
I didn't ask for any of this. How am I
supposed to live here now, huh?

12:07.119 --> 12:09.705
My whole house smells like
toe cheese and dry cleaning.

12:09.913 --> 12:13.000
Because you didn't follow
my instructions.

12:13.208 --> 12:14.918
Oh, well, <i>Heil</i> Hitler, bitch.

12:15.127 --> 12:17.379
And let me tell you something else.

12:17.588 --> 12:20.382
We flipped a coin, okay?

12:20.591 --> 12:23.135
You and me. You and me.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.637
Coin flip is sacred.

12:36.148 --> 12:38.442
Your job is waiting for you
in that basement...

12:38.650 --> 12:40.861
...as per the coin.

12:41.070 --> 12:42.571
Fucking do it, already.

12:57.544 --> 13:00.506
That's what she said. Yeah.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.884
Yeah. Yeah, I think
we have some of those.

13:04.593 --> 13:06.553
- Yeah, you'll have to try them on.
- Hello?

13:06.762 --> 13:09.223
- Seven and a half, maybe. I don't know.
- Excuse me.

13:09.431 --> 13:10.849
Do you have these in black?

13:13.268 --> 13:15.020
Anyways, so like I was saying...

13:15.229 --> 13:18.565
...I went to the party the other night.
Yeah, Tony was there.

13:22.403 --> 13:23.696
Whatever.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.532
Hey, where have you been?
I called you two hours ago.

13:26.740 --> 13:29.201
<i>Sorry, baby, I'm kind of busy here.</i>
<i>What's up?</i>

13:29.410 --> 13:33.622
Well, kind of a lot, actually,
and it's a delicate subject.

13:33.831 --> 13:38.669
- So I need you to focus, and...
<i>- Hey, sit down! Sit down!</i>

13:38.877 --> 13:40.963
Damn it, Hank.

13:41.171 --> 13:43.924
I'm sorry, babe, I'm just in the middle
of something here.

13:44.133 --> 13:45.968
Get down. Get down.

13:46.176 --> 13:49.888
Sit down! Sit your ass down,
<i>comprende?</i> You too, sit down!

13:55.227 --> 13:57.354
I'm back, babe. What's up?

13:57.563 --> 14:00.899
- Walter Jr.
<i>- Yeah, what about him?</i>

14:01.442 --> 14:04.695
Marijuana. He's smoking it.

14:04.903 --> 14:07.072
<i>Excuse me, his own mother</i>
<i>seems to think so. </i>

14:07.281 --> 14:09.199
- Skyler told you that?
<i>- She inferred it. </i>

14:09.408 --> 14:10.701
She inferred it, huh?

14:11.702 --> 14:13.704
She strongly inferred it.

14:13.912 --> 14:19.460
Like, " Doctor, my friend suffers
from erectile dysfunction. "

14:19.668 --> 14:21.211
<i>- Please, come on. </i>
- All right.

14:21.420 --> 14:23.547
- Talk to him.
<i>- Walt should talk to him. </i>

14:23.756 --> 14:25.716
Skyler, better yet.
She'll kick his butt.

14:25.924 --> 14:28.010
<i>I think it ought to be you. </i>

14:28.218 --> 14:30.220
You know, tell him
some horror stories.

14:30.429 --> 14:33.140
Maybe show him
some autopsy pictures.

14:33.349 --> 14:35.184
An autopsy of a pot overdose?
Come on.

14:35.517 --> 14:37.728
I don't know, baby,
it's just that, you know...

14:37.936 --> 14:41.106
...I figure his dad should be the one
doing this, don't you think?

14:41.315 --> 14:43.567
Hank, he respects you.

14:46.987 --> 14:50.824
Yeah, all right. Well, listen, yeah,
I'll swing by their place after work.

14:51.033 --> 14:53.744
- Good. Scare him straight.
<i>- Yeah, yeah. </i>

14:53.952 --> 14:55.537
Hey, where's my sugar?

15:00.876 --> 15:02.002
Excuse me, ma'am.

15:02.461 --> 15:05.422
Ma'am, you need to be wearing footies
before you try those on.

15:05.964 --> 15:07.549
I'm extremely clean.

15:07.758 --> 15:10.761
Yeah, well, I'd really appreciate it.

15:12.262 --> 15:15.724
Hey, sorry about that.
Yeah, I'll check.

15:16.684 --> 15:19.144
You know, I hid a pair for you
last week, grey ones.

16:10.154 --> 16:13.323
- What do you think?
- About what?

16:14.533 --> 16:15.826
This look like a nice place?

16:16.702 --> 16:18.829
No, not really.

16:19.038 --> 16:21.040
Think you'd like to live here?

16:21.540 --> 16:23.042
No.

16:23.250 --> 16:26.128
- Sure about that?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

16:26.336 --> 16:29.423
I thought we were going to
Cold Stone Creamery.

16:29.631 --> 16:32.176
Yeah, yeah, well,
we took a little detour.

16:32.384 --> 16:35.429
Figure we'll come over
and check out how the other half lives.

16:35.637 --> 16:38.140
This here is what we call
the Crystal Palace.

16:38.349 --> 16:41.101
You know who lives in the palace?
Meth-heads.

16:41.852 --> 16:44.104
Nasty, skeevy meth-heads...

16:44.313 --> 16:48.275
...who'd sell their grandma's coochie
for a hit.

16:48.484 --> 16:50.944
Oh, you think that's funny?
That's funny, huh? Yeah.

16:51.153 --> 16:53.447
Let me tell you something.
Every one of these...

16:53.655 --> 16:57.951
...miserable wastes of skin
got started how?

16:58.160 --> 17:00.371
- How do you think they started?
- I don't know.

17:00.579 --> 17:03.374
What do you think they were doing
before they graduated...

17:03.582 --> 17:06.251
...to shooting meth in their dicks?

17:07.920 --> 17:09.713
A gateway drug.

17:09.922 --> 17:11.632
That's what we call it.

17:11.839 --> 17:14.175
Dollars to doughnuts,
and I shit you not...

17:14.385 --> 17:18.262
...that gateway drug was marijuana,
every time.

17:18.472 --> 17:20.473
- You understand?
- Yeah.

17:20.683 --> 17:23.727
So why are you telling me this?

17:23.935 --> 17:26.563
Because I love you,
you little bastard.

17:27.189 --> 17:29.858
And, hey, I was young once,
you know.

17:30.818 --> 17:33.654
The world's a messed up place,
you know.

17:33.862 --> 17:37.199
You know, just this one time,
you know...

17:37.408 --> 17:40.411
Hey! Hey! Hey, you!

17:40.619 --> 17:44.498
Yeah, you, princess. Get over here.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.712
Hey, don't make me
get out of the car.

17:54.133 --> 17:55.426
Check this out.

17:55.634 --> 17:57.678
What I'm talking about.

17:58.762 --> 18:01.181
- I ain't holding, okay?
- Did I say open your mouth?

18:01.390 --> 18:03.267
And hands off the car.

18:04.018 --> 18:07.354
Other side. Go around the other side,
talk to my friend here.

18:10.274 --> 18:12.401
What's your name, sweetheart?

18:13.694 --> 18:15.404
- Wendy.
- Wendy, huh?

18:15.612 --> 18:17.740
How much you charge
for a windy, Wendy?

18:18.240 --> 18:21.160
- I ain't doing him, he's a kid.
- Jesus, was that my question?

18:21.368 --> 18:24.121
Don't think so hard,
it's gonna hurt your brain.

18:24.329 --> 18:27.207
- Are you on the pipe or on the needle?
- Nothing. Neither.

18:27.416 --> 18:29.585
Yeah, yeah.
Show us your teeth, huh?

18:29.793 --> 18:32.671
Come on, Wendy,
let's see those pearly whites.

18:34.465 --> 18:38.344
Oh, God. See that? Pipe, definitely.

18:38.552 --> 18:40.179
Big time, big time on the pipe.

18:40.387 --> 18:42.473
You got something
you wanna ask Wendy?

18:42.681 --> 18:44.266
No, not really.

18:44.475 --> 18:46.602
You ever smoke anything else,
Wendy?

18:47.102 --> 18:49.355
Sausages don't count.

18:50.773 --> 18:53.942
Seriously, tell my friend here
how you got started.

18:54.151 --> 18:57.946
Probably used to be, what? Like a
Girl Scout, or sang in the church choir.

18:58.155 --> 19:02.201
- What are you, like, handicapped?
- He broke his leg playing football.

19:02.409 --> 19:06.080
He's a qb. Got an arm like a howitzer.

19:07.539 --> 19:10.292
So tell me, Wendy, you smoke pot?

19:10.501 --> 19:11.627
Why, you got some?

19:11.835 --> 19:14.463
No. Right, hoof it, get lost.
Get out of here.

19:14.671 --> 19:17.925
Hey, fair warning, next time
I'm gonna bust you.

19:25.432 --> 19:26.725
So, what do you think?

19:28.977 --> 19:29.978
Cool.

19:39.405 --> 19:42.950
Shut the door. Shut the door.
Lock it. Lock it, lock it.

19:43.951 --> 19:44.993
Who the hell was that?

19:45.202 --> 19:47.955
Cop and some football player
messing with me.

19:48.163 --> 19:50.416
They ask about me, huh?

19:51.333 --> 19:53.127
No, I think they just wanted pot.

20:07.141 --> 20:08.726
Right there.

20:10.144 --> 20:12.438
Shit, I left my root beer.

21:01.653 --> 21:04.698
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey, sweetie, it's me.

21:04.907 --> 21:06.700
Listen, I'm so sorry.

21:06.909 --> 21:12.122
Time, it just completely got away
from me. I'm just...

21:13.332 --> 21:17.086
My fault, my fault.
Bogdan just kept me here late...

21:17.294 --> 21:19.880
...you know, doing some inventory...

21:20.089 --> 21:22.675
...and I should've just...

21:22.883 --> 21:28.013
You know, you're right.
I gotta learn to say, you know, "No. "

21:28.222 --> 21:30.224
But...

21:31.600 --> 21:34.019
Sky? You there?

21:35.437 --> 21:37.523
<i>You're at the car wash?</i>

21:38.482 --> 21:40.109
Yeah.

21:40.901 --> 21:45.906
I seriously doubt that,
since you quit two weeks ago.

21:51.578 --> 21:55.416
I called Bogdan, looking for you.

21:55.958 --> 21:58.043
Quite an earful he gave me.

22:00.170 --> 22:01.922
Listen...

22:03.590 --> 22:05.801
Listen, I'll come home
and we'll talk about it.

22:07.344 --> 22:09.805
- I don't think so, Walt.
<i>- Honey... </i>

22:10.014 --> 22:12.016
Wherever you are...

22:13.100 --> 22:15.894
...why don't you just
stay there tonight?

22:20.566 --> 22:21.984
Skyler?

22:23.777 --> 22:25.779
<i>Walter?</i>

22:26.155 --> 22:27.614
Hello?

22:27.823 --> 22:30.617
Hey, there's a hungry guy here.

24:08.882 --> 24:10.884
Come on.

24:33.323 --> 24:34.950
Damn.

24:35.451 --> 24:37.828
I didn't think you were coming back.

24:52.176 --> 24:53.761
How long was I out?

24:55.012 --> 24:56.680
Ten, 15 minutes?

24:58.682 --> 25:02.311
I've never seen someone knock
themselves out just by coughing.

25:02.519 --> 25:04.563
Were you on the same shit
you used on me?

25:13.572 --> 25:14.948
I've got lung cancer.

25:39.765 --> 25:42.226
I'll make you another sandwich.

26:19.138 --> 26:20.931
It's safe.

26:21.932 --> 26:23.934
There's no poison.

26:27.104 --> 26:29.231
Because that would be
the way to do it...

26:29.982 --> 26:31.984
...if you're gonna do it.

26:33.277 --> 26:35.487
I suppose it would.

26:37.281 --> 26:39.867
You being a chemist and all.

26:57.051 --> 27:00.971
So that name...

27:01.388 --> 27:03.557
...Krazy-8.

27:03.849 --> 27:05.976
Do I really have to call you that?

27:06.185 --> 27:08.771
I mean, no offence, but...

27:09.313 --> 27:11.273
...don't you have a real name?

27:12.524 --> 27:14.276
Domingo.

27:15.361 --> 27:17.029
Domingo.

27:17.237 --> 27:19.990
That's "Sunday," right?

27:22.493 --> 27:26.330
I'd rather call you that,
if you don't mind.

27:29.041 --> 27:31.668
I can't say I ever liked it much.

27:34.797 --> 27:37.883
So, Domingo...

27:38.092 --> 27:41.929
...you from around town here
or someplace else?

27:42.262 --> 27:44.306
Hey, Walter?
You getting to know me...

27:44.515 --> 27:47.559
...is not gonna make it easier
for you to kill me.

27:48.102 --> 27:49.853
Not that I mind, you understand?

27:52.439 --> 27:55.943
You know, you keep telling me
that I don't have it in me.

27:56.151 --> 27:57.820
Well, maybe.

27:58.320 --> 28:00.197
But maybe not.

28:03.367 --> 28:06.078
I sure as hell am looking for
any reason not to.

28:06.286 --> 28:09.707
I mean, any good reason at all.

28:15.879 --> 28:17.965
Sell me.

28:18.173 --> 28:20.217
Tell me what it is.

28:23.846 --> 28:26.265
I'd start off by promising
that if you let me go...

28:26.473 --> 28:29.810
...I won't come after you,
that you'd be safe.

28:30.019 --> 28:32.021
I guess I'd say
what happened between us...

28:33.147 --> 28:34.356
...never happened.

28:34.565 --> 28:38.235
And what's best for both parties
is we forget all about it.

28:38.986 --> 28:42.614
But you know anybody in my situation
would make promises like that.

28:42.823 --> 28:45.200
And, in my case,
they happen to be true.

28:45.409 --> 28:46.869
You'll never know for sure.

28:50.914 --> 28:53.083
So, what else can I tell you?

28:58.964 --> 29:00.841
I don't know.

29:02.217 --> 29:04.762
But you've gotta convince me.

29:05.637 --> 29:09.558
And you're going nowhere
until you do.

29:10.768 --> 29:13.103
- Hey, yeah.
- Yeah.

29:13.395 --> 29:15.564
I'm from here in town, man.

29:16.357 --> 29:18.901
ABQ, born and bred.

29:19.109 --> 29:21.028
Never left.

29:21.653 --> 29:24.907
Studied Business Administration
over at UNM...

29:25.115 --> 29:26.325
...got my degree.

29:27.576 --> 29:29.244
Really?

29:31.872 --> 29:35.417
Does that come in handy
in the drug trade?

29:35.626 --> 29:37.419
Doesn't hurt.

29:38.253 --> 29:41.006
I was gonna study music originally.

29:41.465 --> 29:44.218
Maybe even try out
for Oberlin and Berklee.

29:44.426 --> 29:47.680
My pops talked me out of it.

29:47.888 --> 29:51.767
Said there was no money in it unless
I wind up some bullshit rock star...

29:51.975 --> 29:54.937
...and I hadn't a snowball chance
at that one.

29:55.979 --> 29:58.148
What does your dad do?

29:59.191 --> 30:02.486
He owns Tampico Furniture
over on Menaul.

30:03.570 --> 30:06.156
Wait a minute, I know that place.

30:08.701 --> 30:10.577
Wait a minute. That's...

30:10.786 --> 30:13.163
That's that...

30:13.372 --> 30:15.749
They used to have those late-night...

30:15.958 --> 30:18.210
- The stupid commercials.
- That they had, yeah.

30:18.419 --> 30:21.547
Yeah, that's him.
Been doing them for over 30 years.

30:21.755 --> 30:25.426
Wait a minute.
How did it go? It was...

30:25.759 --> 30:28.470
Wait, wait, wait. It was...

30:29.680 --> 30:34.226
<i>Don't let shopping</i>
<i>Strain your brain-o</i>

30:34.518 --> 30:38.147
<i>Just sing this short refrain-o</i>

30:38.355 --> 30:41.525
<i>- Our furniture is</i> bueno
<i>- Our furniture is</i> bueno

30:41.734 --> 30:45.320
<i>- Tampico is the name- o</i>
<i>- Tampico is the name- o</i>

30:55.873 --> 30:58.917
Pretty moronic. But what can you do?

30:59.126 --> 31:02.838
Well, it did tend
to stick in your head.

31:03.047 --> 31:06.800
Did you write that?
Being the musician in the family.

31:07.009 --> 31:10.971
Oh, no, man.
It was my crazy uncle Alex.

31:11.180 --> 31:13.432
He sings it at bars,
trying to pick up on women.

31:15.017 --> 31:18.979
His mind, it's like saying,
"Hey, I wrote 'Stairway to Heaven. "'

31:21.190 --> 31:24.193
Yeah, but at Tampico Furniture, I...

31:24.735 --> 31:29.573
I think when my son was born
that we bought his bassinet there.

31:29.782 --> 31:32.951
We don't sell bassinets there.
It's more of a speciality item.

31:33.160 --> 31:34.370
We did use to sell cribs.

31:36.622 --> 31:39.166
A crib, then, okay. A crib.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.502
Yeah. No, I remember that.

31:41.710 --> 31:47.758
In fact, I remember recognising
your dad from those commercials.

31:47.966 --> 31:51.387
Although, he wasn't anywhere near
as friendly in real life.

31:51.595 --> 31:53.514
Yeah. No shit.

31:53.722 --> 31:56.225
Did he try selling you
that extended warranty?

31:56.725 --> 31:58.686
Yeah, he probably did.

31:58.894 --> 32:01.271
And I was probably dumb enough
to buy it.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.399
Yeah, that was his big thing.

32:03.607 --> 32:05.234
You ask him for a glass of water...

32:05.442 --> 32:08.404
...he'd tell you you need
an extended warranty on the ice.

32:12.408 --> 32:14.827
- Did you work there too?
- Only my whole life.

32:15.369 --> 32:17.955
Up until the day I said,
"Fuck you," and quit.

32:22.292 --> 32:24.044
So...

32:25.838 --> 32:28.590
...16 years ago,
how old would you have been?

32:30.009 --> 32:32.928
If it was after school,
trust me, I was there.

32:33.178 --> 32:35.180
Might have even helped ring you up.

32:35.389 --> 32:39.101
You and your extended warranty
on the crib.

32:47.735 --> 32:49.778
Small world.

32:51.113 --> 32:53.032
It is.

32:54.408 --> 32:56.994
The paths we take, huh?

33:22.561 --> 33:24.980
Jesse know you've got cancer?

33:27.941 --> 33:29.985
No one but you.

33:31.487 --> 33:34.239
- Not your family?
- No.

33:36.116 --> 33:37.659
Why not?

33:41.413 --> 33:46.293
Not a conversation
that I'm even remotely ready to have.

33:48.629 --> 33:50.631
That's why you're cooking meth?

33:51.507 --> 33:53.926
You wanna leave money
for your family.

33:56.095 --> 33:57.680
Hell.

33:57.930 --> 34:00.683
I'll write you a cheque right now
if you let me go.

34:06.313 --> 34:08.565
Like I said, Walter...

34:09.233 --> 34:12.152
...if this line of work
doesn't suit you...

34:16.864 --> 34:19.159
...get out before it's too late.

34:25.456 --> 34:27.960
I don't know what to do.

34:38.178 --> 34:39.346
You do.

34:58.532 --> 35:00.701
I'll get the key.

36:42.428 --> 36:44.346
No.

36:44.847 --> 36:46.473
No.

36:46.849 --> 36:49.351
Oh, no, no, no.

37:01.196 --> 37:03.449
No. No, don't do this.

37:03.657 --> 37:06.910
Don't do this.
Why are you doing this?

37:07.578 --> 37:10.247
Why are you doing this?

37:43.405 --> 37:45.574
You're doing the right thing, Walter.

37:52.664 --> 37:54.541
Do you wanna?

38:09.390 --> 38:13.185
So you're not angry?

38:15.771 --> 38:17.690
Angry at you?

38:19.983 --> 38:22.277
Live and let live, man.

38:24.488 --> 38:26.657
That's very understanding.

38:26.865 --> 38:28.701
Whatever, man.

38:28.909 --> 38:31.036
I just wanna go home.

38:36.959 --> 38:38.711
Me too.

38:46.552 --> 38:48.595
Unlock me, Walter.

39:04.194 --> 39:06.488
The moment I do...

39:08.073 --> 39:11.035
...are you gonna stick me
with that broken piece of plate?

39:39.897 --> 39:41.648
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39:41.857 --> 39:43.692
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39:46.153 --> 39:47.696
I'm sorry.

39:54.661 --> 39:56.663
I'm sorry.

39:56.955 --> 39:59.166
I'm so sorry.

41:28.005 --> 41:29.798
Hello?

41:30.799 --> 41:33.135
Anybody down here?

42:40.536 --> 42:42.621
Everybody...

42:43.580 --> 42:46.208
...I need you all to take your seats.

42:46.417 --> 42:49.211
Settle down, please. Thank you.

42:49.420 --> 42:52.172
I understand
that Mr. White is feeling...

42:52.381 --> 42:54.967
...a little under the weather
this morning.

42:55.175 --> 43:00.139
So you folks are going to have
to be making do with me today.

43:00.347 --> 43:04.601
And we are going to be watching
a very interesting video...

43:04.810 --> 43:08.272
...on carbon.

43:08.522 --> 43:09.732
Very important stuff.

43:13.235 --> 43:16.822
- So, what do you think?
- It's a cook site. Gotta be.

43:17.031 --> 43:20.284
Nobody came way the hell out here
just to buy.

43:20.492 --> 43:23.245
Fire there could have started
by accident.

43:23.454 --> 43:25.956
I don't think that was meant
to destroy evidence.

43:26.665 --> 43:30.002
Got a couple of Dooley tracks
headed away, towards the road.

43:30.210 --> 43:33.464
So, what, they're in
some sort of camper-slash-lab?

43:33.672 --> 43:36.717
They accidentally start a fire
and everybody FOs?

43:36.925 --> 43:38.594
Yeah. Why not?

43:38.802 --> 43:41.889
So why did that little hair-gelled shit
leave his car?

43:45.225 --> 43:50.147
- Gomey, it's a culture in decline.
- It's a rich and vibrant culture.

43:50.356 --> 43:52.608
It's a car that jumps up and down.

43:53.067 --> 43:54.276
What the hell?

43:54.485 --> 43:57.613
You people used to be conquistadors,
for chrissake.

43:57.821 --> 44:01.909
Smells like a Drakkar Noir
factory in here.

44:02.326 --> 44:03.869
I already searched it.

44:04.411 --> 44:06.205
Yeah.

44:07.122 --> 44:09.124
You're wasting your time.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.961
Give it up. If this here's a trap car,
it's gonna take more...

44:13.170 --> 44:15.839
...than your dumb white ass to find it.
- Oh, yeah?

44:16.048 --> 44:20.010
You are talking to the trap-car master,
my friend.

44:20.219 --> 44:22.513
I'm Rain Man counting
his toothpicks.

44:23.013 --> 44:25.599
Yeah, you're like Rain Man. Retarded.

44:33.232 --> 44:34.650
Yeah, baby.

44:38.862 --> 44:41.407
- Hello, zippy.
- Asshole.

44:42.282 --> 44:46.120
Sort of looks like meth
but it's too damn white.

44:48.664 --> 44:50.416
You know what I'm thinking, Gomey?

44:50.624 --> 44:53.335
Yep. Somebody croaked our snitch.

44:53.544 --> 44:55.004
Hey, agent.

44:55.212 --> 44:57.047
You got something?

45:31.749 --> 45:33.667
<i>I don't know. </i>

45:34.668 --> 45:37.087
It just... Doesn't it seem like...

45:37.296 --> 45:39.923
...something's missing?

45:40.174 --> 45:42.217
What about the soul?

45:53.812 --> 45:56.148
The soul.

46:03.530 --> 46:06.533
There's nothing but chemistry here.

47:11.598 --> 47:13.475
Skyler?

47:23.277 --> 47:25.904
There's something I have to tell you.

47:26.305 --> 47:32.577
