WEBVTT

00:01.836 --> 00:02.837
Hmm.

00:05.547 --> 00:08.634
How is the French toast?

00:10.302 --> 00:11.804
So good you'll think
you're in Paris.

00:12.596 --> 00:13.555
Really?

00:14.306 --> 00:15.808
Look, this is a diner.

00:15.850 --> 00:17.810
We got an ex-con
back there

00:17.852 --> 00:19.436
slinging
three-day-old bread
on a dirty grill.

00:21.313 --> 00:25.693
(MOCKING) How's
the French toast...

00:25.734 --> 00:27.945
She is not
a fan of yours.

00:27.987 --> 00:29.404
She's jumping
on the bandwagon.

00:29.446 --> 00:33.158
We've been there since
the beginning.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.994
Friends, Mr. Dunbar
is right behind me.

00:35.995 --> 00:37.496
Oh, please do
yourselves a favor

00:37.538 --> 00:39.623
and ask him
how his cruise went.

00:39.665 --> 00:41.792
Hey, if it isn't the cat
of Cirque Du So Lame.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.338
Hey.
So how was your cruise?

00:46.380 --> 00:47.214
Great!

00:48.507 --> 00:50.300
How are you guys?
That's the important th.

00:50.342 --> 00:52.219
Oh, how is
the new job going?

00:52.761 --> 00:54.763
Wait, sir...

00:54.805 --> 00:56.181
Are you sure there's nothing
more you wish to share

00:56.223 --> 00:57.432
about your high seas
adventure?

00:58.017 --> 00:58.934
Uh, oh, yeah.

00:59.935 --> 01:01.562
Ran into someone
I used to know.

01:01.603 --> 01:05.566
It's actually
no big deal.
Hmm...

01:05.607 --> 01:07.026
Well, hello there,
youngish lady.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.451
Well, hello, Russell.

01:18.913 --> 01:20.831
Oh, for (FOGHORN BLOWS) sak!

01:22.541 --> 01:23.417
Liz?

01:24.209 --> 01:25.836
God, what a small world.

01:25.878 --> 01:27.379
It's not that small.
Liz fits in it.

01:30.841 --> 01:32.217
Anyway,
so that's my story.

01:32.760 --> 01:33.677
Hmm, is it?

01:36.137 --> 01:38.348
Nothing else
happened of note?

01:38.390 --> 01:40.475
I told you this in conf.
You could be fired for .

01:40.517 --> 01:42.143
I've long since given up
on that fantasy.

01:43.729 --> 01:45.731
You know,
if you're not
going to tell it,

01:45.773 --> 01:47.106
I'd be more
than happy to...

01:47.148 --> 01:48.275
No, no, no.
Fine, fine, fine, fine.

01:48.316 --> 01:49.109
I got it.

01:51.070 --> 01:53.363
Okay, um,
after a couple
of mango-ritas, uh...

01:55.574 --> 01:58.077
Liz and I got
into a classical
nautical argument

01:58.118 --> 02:00.412
which there's
only one way to solve.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.371
(BOTH SIGHING)

02:05.042 --> 02:06.334
You were right, lover.

02:07.335 --> 02:08.629
It was the motion
of the ocean.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.883
You see,
the size of the ship
has nothing to do with .

02:14.843 --> 02:16.053
Prove it
to me again, sailor.
Oh.

02:16.929 --> 02:18.013
Permission to
come aboard?

02:18.055 --> 02:18.847
Granted.

02:26.897 --> 02:27.648
Oh, no thanks.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.776
Can you wrap mine
to go, please?

02:31.526 --> 02:35.656
Just throw mine away.

02:35.697 --> 02:36.782
Well, that's the end
of my story.

02:36.824 --> 02:37.574
Is it?

02:40.410 --> 02:41.745
Is there not
just a skosh more?

02:45.540 --> 02:48.502
You know how sometimes
you say something
you really don't mean?

02:50.253 --> 02:51.046
Oh, I do.

02:53.423 --> 02:56.259
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

02:58.012 --> 02:58.887

03:12.943 --> 03:14.862

I could have been there

04:02.617 --> 04:04.536
We were so drunk,
it's not like it's real.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.123
There's my hubby.

bagged our bucks.

You might want to
keep him on standby.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.872
Liz, we had fun
on that cruise.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.416
That was a great time.

04:51.458 --> 04:52.918
But this whole
marriage thing.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.420
That's... That's just
a goof, right?

04:57.589 --> 04:59.549
You mean a beautiful gof
that will join
our lives together

04:59.591 --> 05:07.390
till the end of time?

05:07.432 --> 05:10.978
I actually meant
the other kind of goof.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.772
Anyway, I was
just at the DMV
getting a new license.

05:14.397 --> 05:15.398
Notice anything?

05:17.025 --> 05:20.070
That you lost 20 pounds
while you were there?

05:20.112 --> 05:20.862
No, this.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.740
Ah. You took
Mr. Dunbar's name.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.495
Yep.
Elizabeth Kornblatt-Dun.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.333
Wow, three names.
I'm like
Catherine Zeta-Jones.

05:35.585 --> 05:38.255
In what way, exactly?

05:38.297 --> 05:39.298
LMAO, Jeff.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.094
Anyway, I've got
an ingrown toenail
that needs excavating.

05:45.304 --> 05:48.307
So I will swing by
your oficina for lunch.

05:48.723 --> 05:49.348

06:08.285 --> 06:09.828
It's hard to figure out
who loses more.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.625
Should we get her something?
Like some kind of baske?

06:15.667 --> 06:17.085
Of what?
Antibiotics and ointmen?

06:21.380 --> 06:22.423
Hey, Audrey.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.969
Just going roof-side,
do some reading,
catch some rays.

06:26.803 --> 06:27.804
Hmm. What're you reading?

06:27.846 --> 06:30.349
Um...busted.

06:32.767 --> 06:33.810
I'll see you later.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.235
Jeff leaves,
all I get is a fist bump

06:41.276 --> 06:42.819
and a warning to
avoid the bathroom
for a while.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.992
Well, Adam and I have
only been together
for a couple of years.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.827
Oh, no, Jeff and I
were only together
about six months

06:50.869 --> 06:53.121
before he started
bringing food
into the bed.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.122
Ooh, like whipped cream
and stuff?

06:54.164 --> 06:55.207
No, like a hoagie.

for him to finish
before me.

07:03.006 --> 07:04.549
You know
what works for us?

07:04.591 --> 07:07.386
Talking dirty.
Does Jeff do that?

07:07.426 --> 07:09.304
God, no.
He's way too repressed.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.267
Although one time
he did say some
pretty nasty things

07:13.308 --> 07:24.319
when his hoagie
rolled onto the floor.

07:24.361 --> 07:25.279
Hey.
Hey.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.697
Whatcha doing?

07:27.739 --> 07:29.574
Watchin' the tube,
thinking about
having a hoagie.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.959
I have an idea
that might make you
re-think that hoagie.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.171
You wanna
order up some wings?

07:43.213 --> 07:43.964
No.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.800
I thought maybe
we'd fool around.

07:47.259 --> 07:48.051
Really?

07:48.927 --> 07:49.761
Why not?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.389
I don't know.

07:52.431 --> 07:54.349
You're usually the keepr
of the reasons "why not"

07:58.103 --> 08:00.272
And maybe when
we're doing this,
you could uh...you know.

08:00.939 --> 08:03.442
Say some things.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.902
What kind of things?

08:05.944 --> 08:09.239
You know,
things about
what we're doing.

08:09.281 --> 08:12.200
Oh, you mean
like sex talk.
Yeah.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.034
Well...

08:14.619 --> 08:17.164
You know
that I'm not much
of a talker.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.707
So, how 'bout
we do our thing.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.460
And then afterwards
we can have a brief Q&amp;A.

08:25.880 --> 08:26.714
Come on.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.843
Let's mix it up a littl,
it might be fun.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.095
All right, hey,
I guess I could
give this a shot.

08:32.137 --> 08:33.013
All right.

08:33.763 --> 08:34.555
(LAUGHS)

08:37.100 --> 08:38.852
All right...
Here comes the sex talk.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.228
Yeah, bring it.

08:43.815 --> 08:46.193
I'm doing a little bit
of work up here...
on these.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.029
As I'm sure
you can attest.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.907
Yes, Jeff.
I can attest.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.328
By the way,
you can loosen
your grip.

08:56.370 --> 08:57.662
They're not
going to run away.

09:00.832 --> 09:04.294
Got it, well,
the plan is to do a lite
more work up here.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.798
And then
I'm gonna pack it up,
head down south.

09:12.635 --> 09:13.553
Head down south?

09:14.471 --> 09:15.514
Well, if north
is your head.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.848
No, no, I get it.
I get it.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.561
Maybe you can, you know,
be a little more specif.

09:22.103 --> 09:22.812
Roger that.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.482
My right hand is
on your right breast.

09:28.276 --> 09:31.154
Well, my right,
your left, but I...

09:31.196 --> 09:31.946
Okay.
What?

09:32.822 --> 09:33.990
That was
a fun experiment.

09:35.534 --> 09:36.659
That's wasn't
what you wanted?

09:37.536 --> 09:38.328
No, no,
nobody wants that.

09:38.370 --> 09:39.246
(SIGHS)

09:43.333 --> 09:44.418
All right.

09:46.127 --> 09:58.098
Would it be all right...
Yes, go ahead.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.266
Hey.

10:05.146 --> 10:08.525
What the hell happened
to you, Braveheart?

10:08.567 --> 10:09.817
Well, I was tanning
on the roof

10:09.859 --> 10:13.780
and I fell asleep
on one side.

10:13.821 --> 10:14.697
Stupid sun.

10:17.409 --> 10:18.910
Not sure it's the sun
that comes off as stupi.

10:21.662 --> 10:24.374
I'm just gonna
tan the other side,
even everything out.

10:24.416 --> 10:25.333
Solid plan.

10:27.752 --> 10:29.296
Let me ask you somethin.
Do you ever talk dirty
to Jen?

10:29.337 --> 10:30.838
Oh, yeah.
All the time.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.173
Must be where
Audrey got it.

10:32.215 --> 10:33.758
Last night she asked
for dirty talk.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.593
From you?

10:37.304 --> 10:38.805
Well, how'd it go?

10:38.846 --> 10:40.932
Not well.
What do you say?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.976
Oh, man, you say
all kinds of things,
you know?

10:43.017 --> 10:44.769
I mean, I tell Jen
what I'm about
to do to her.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.022
And then I want her
to tell me what
she's gonna do to me.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.399
Using adult language.

10:52.277 --> 10:53.945
Yeah, yeah, man.
She loves it.

10:53.987 --> 10:57.240
Of course she does.
She's filthy.

10:57.282 --> 10:58.408
But Audrey is my wife.

10:59.618 --> 11:00.701
She's going to
be the mother
of my child.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.703
Okay, Jeff,
you gotta get over that.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.748
All right,
she obviously wants it.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.251
Just say the dirtiest ts
that come to your mind.

11:08.293 --> 11:09.752
Seriously?
Yeah, dude.

11:09.794 --> 11:13.840
Dude, the filthier
the better.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.216
Filthier the better,
I'll give it a try.

11:15.258 --> 11:17.135
Okay, hey,
try it right now.

11:19.887 --> 11:20.930
Pretend that I'm Audrey.

11:23.850 --> 11:24.518
Okay...

11:25.935 --> 11:27.646
Hey, Audrey,
why is your face
two different colors,

11:27.686 --> 11:35.445
you dumbass?

11:35.487 --> 11:37.405
Go into your office.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.198
Why?

11:38.948 --> 11:39.824
Just go.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.626
Oh, hello,
man of mine.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.212
Hey...

11:53.046 --> 11:53.963
What's that?

11:55.006 --> 11:56.383
What does is it
look like, silly?

11:56.424 --> 11:58.301
It's a provocative photo
of your wife and kids.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.262
I need to lie down.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.558
Well, make it quick.

12:04.599 --> 12:09.479
I've got a honey-do list
that's longer
than my left boob.

12:09.521 --> 12:12.399
You know
about that, right?

12:12.440 --> 12:13.483
Well, no.

12:17.696 --> 12:20.657
Anyway, I'd love to sta,
but Tiffy's at the vet
with volcanic diarrhea.

12:20.699 --> 12:21.866
That was
a fun cab ride.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.203
So as they say
in Australia, good day..

12:25.828 --> 12:26.621
Mate!

12:30.417 --> 12:32.502
Timmy, you got to
use your giant brain

12:32.544 --> 12:34.045
and find me
a way out of this.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.172
I don't know how, sir.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.840
I believe
once a marriage has
been consummated,

12:37.882 --> 12:40.260
it's legally binding.

12:40.301 --> 12:41.261
Wait a second.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.390
Wait a second,
it hasn't been
consummated.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.891
You said
you bumped uglies
on the boat.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.936
Though,
with the two of you

12:49.977 --> 12:51.354
that very well
could mean kissing.

12:54.399 --> 12:55.900
I know we did it
before the marriage,

12:55.942 --> 12:57.569
but after the ceremony
we both passed out.

12:58.528 --> 12:59.654
There's my loophole.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.365
Where're you going, sir?

13:02.407 --> 13:04.743
To end this marriage.

13:04.783 --> 13:05.535
(SIGHS)

13:07.662 --> 13:09.163
It's gonna be tough
on the children.

13:11.165 --> 13:16.546
But I'm sure they'll lad
on their feet.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.339
Ah, it's a shame
no one was around
to hear that.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.614
Ah, yes, mm-hmm.

13:43.281 --> 13:44.324
What's going on?

13:45.450 --> 13:47.327
Well, I was just thinkig

13:47.368 --> 13:48.911
we could give
that sexy talk
another shot.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.247
Really?

13:52.791 --> 13:54.959
'Cause last night
you seemed kinda
uncomfortable with it.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.252
Caught me off guard,
I've regrouped,

13:56.294 --> 13:57.587
I'm ready to
take another run.

13:59.631 --> 14:00.381
Okay.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.761
Why don't you give me
a little preview.

14:04.803 --> 14:06.554
Sure, and I'd like
to start by saying
that you, my lady,

14:07.013 --> 14:07.846
are a...

14:08.515 --> 14:09.223
What?

14:12.268 --> 14:14.604
Oh, you like that.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.147
No, god, no.
I hate that word.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.692
Every woman
hates that word.

14:18.733 --> 14:21.361
Why would you
call me that?

14:21.402 --> 14:23.613
It was the filthiest thg
I could think of.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.072
Adam told me
to go super dirty.

14:25.114 --> 14:25.824
Adam?

14:27.367 --> 14:29.160
You took advice
from a man who was
outsmarted by the sun?

14:31.538 --> 14:33.039
You know what,
just forget it.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.459
We'll just go back
to the pawing
and the grunting,

14:37.544 --> 14:40.672
all leading up to
the hoagie eating.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.590
Hey, you are the one
who said you wanted me
to talk dirty.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.802
Jeff, I meant fun,
sexy dirty.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.722
Not misogynist
with Tourette's dirty.

14:52.016 --> 14:52.892
(KNOCKING)

14:57.063 --> 14:58.648
Hello, Liz.
I think we need to talk.

14:58.690 --> 14:59.816
You're late
for dinner, honey.

14:59.858 --> 15:00.608
We waited
as long as we could.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.235
Oh, yuck.

15:04.195 --> 15:04.987
Kids...

15:06.030 --> 15:07.407
Can mommy and daddy
have a moment?

15:13.747 --> 15:14.789
Liz, um...

15:15.707 --> 15:17.375
I'll get right
to the point.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.335
I'd like an annulment.

15:19.377 --> 15:22.171
No, you can't do that.

15:22.213 --> 15:23.172
Actually, I can.

15:23.964 --> 15:26.342
Uh, there's a loophole.

15:26.384 --> 15:28.720
And it turns out
if the marriage hasn't
been consummated,

15:28.762 --> 15:31.347
it can be annulled.

15:31.389 --> 15:32.098
Oh...

15:34.809 --> 15:35.976
This is a lot take in.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.480
I'm gonna
make myself some tea.

15:43.025 --> 15:43.818
Liz...

15:44.611 --> 15:46.987
I'm sorry.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.198
I know this is hitting u
pretty hard.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.283
But I just think that...

15:51.951 --> 15:52.786
Whoa.

15:54.537 --> 15:55.747
Penny for your thoughts.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.085
Oh, I know what
you're doing here.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.671
It's not going
to work. Sorry.

16:03.713 --> 16:04.881
We need
another loophole.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.343
Oh, sir.

16:11.554 --> 16:14.599
I just... I lose all col
around an attractive woman.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.058
Uh, and how does that
apply to Liz?

16:18.227 --> 16:19.228
Sir, that's my wife
you're speaking...

16:19.270 --> 16:20.146
Eh, you're right.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.984
You're right.
She looks like a potato
balanced on two bratwursts.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.697
But damn it,
there's something
about that woman.

16:30.698 --> 16:31.491
Sir...

16:32.826 --> 16:34.118
I realize you're
attracted to her

16:35.495 --> 16:37.163
in what seems like
a very Oktoberfest
kind of way.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.583
But for God's sake
just talk to her.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.086
I'm sure
she'll be reasonable
if you tell her firmly

16:44.128 --> 16:45.588
and decisively
that you want out.

16:46.046 --> 16:46.840
Yeah...

16:48.508 --> 16:50.760
You know what,
you're right.
That'll work.

16:50.802 --> 16:53.596
That'll work
as long as I can resist
having sex with her.

16:53.638 --> 16:54.681
You can do it, sir.

16:54.722 --> 16:55.765
Of course I can.

16:57.809 --> 17:03.272
Just in case,
I'll pound one out
in the cab on the way o.

17:03.314 --> 17:04.231
(SIGHS)

17:07.151 --> 17:09.821
Look, I'm sorry
for what I said,
I just--I love you.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.740
If this dirty talk
is something you want,
I want to do it.

17:12.782 --> 17:13.992
You really
don't have to.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.289
But I want to,
you sexy piece of wife.

17:28.422 --> 17:29.674
All right,
I see you're not
going to let this go.

17:29.716 --> 17:30.842
One last try.

17:31.509 --> 17:32.301
Great.

17:37.181 --> 17:39.099
Maybe you could help us
get started.

17:40.518 --> 17:41.268
Okay.

17:42.770 --> 17:46.566
Just take a deep breath
and just try to let go,
okay?

17:52.446 --> 17:53.698
There you go.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.115
What about this?

17:55.157 --> 17:56.576
You are so damn sexy.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.285
Mm, good.

17:59.119 --> 17:59.871
What else?

18:00.287 --> 18:00.997
Mm...

18:01.789 --> 18:02.498
Well...

18:03.875 --> 18:06.544
No, no, no,
just whatever comes
into your head.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.838
Just say it.

18:09.881 --> 18:11.090
There's no way in hell
your parents

18:11.131 --> 18:12.592
are staying with us
this Christmas.

18:18.765 --> 18:19.766
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

18:23.937 --> 18:24.771
Russell?

18:26.856 --> 18:28.024
That's right, it's me.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.277
Why are you wearing
a sleep mask?

18:32.612 --> 18:34.447
Because, Liz,
I came here to
lay down the law,

18:34.488 --> 18:38.952
and I don't want any of
your visual distraction.

18:38.993 --> 18:39.911
Well, that's a shame.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.831
I just got back from Ta,
and I'm rocking a sheerp

18:43.873 --> 18:45.291
and a sensible
new brassiere.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.127
Really?

18:49.629 --> 18:50.421
Nope!

18:51.923 --> 18:53.716
No, I've gotta be stron.

18:53.758 --> 18:55.509
And here's the deal.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.303
Liz, I don't want to
be married to you
anymore.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.763
And I'm sorry,
I know that stings.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.224
But I want you to
grant me a divorce
right now.

19:02.266 --> 19:03.851
No, no,
the lamp stays here.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.061
What're you
talking about?

19:05.103 --> 19:06.145
I was just talking
to the movers.

19:06.186 --> 19:07.647
Now go on,
what were you saying?

19:07.688 --> 19:09.315
I'm saying I'm putting
my foot down.

19:09.356 --> 19:10.942
This is a sham,
obviously we made
a mistake...

19:11.943 --> 19:13.152
What movers?
You're moving where?

19:14.821 --> 19:15.989
In with my hubby,
silly.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.785
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no, no.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.161
No, no, guys,
no one's moving
anywhere.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.079
This has gone on
long enough.

19:23.121 --> 19:23.913
Listen...

19:24.747 --> 19:25.873
Oh, that is sheer.

19:37.051 --> 19:37.927
You, uh...

19:38.803 --> 19:40.054
Give my best
to the missus.

19:45.893 --> 19:46.769
(SIGHS)

19:47.895 --> 19:50.148
Again, I'm sorry
about the other night.

19:50.230 --> 19:53.067
The thing
about your parents
just slipped out.

19:53.109 --> 19:56.529
Is that really what's
on your mind when
we're having sex?

19:56.570 --> 19:58.322
Well, to be honest,
sometimes I think
about your parents

19:59.115 --> 20:03.661
to make it last longer.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.955
Seriously, I don't
get the appeal of
talking during sex.

20:05.997 --> 20:07.540
Well, I guess
it's not for everyone.

20:07.581 --> 20:16.298
But Jen and Adam seem
to like it.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.800
My God, you look
like a lobster.

20:19.010 --> 20:20.511
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
In what way?

20:23.305 --> 20:25.432
All right, just come hee
and let me put
some aloe on it.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.185
No, no, no, no,
touching it
is going to hurt.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.686
I'm in so much pain
already.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.270
Don't be such a baby.

20:30.312 --> 20:31.605
It's supposed to
cool you down.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.025
Ah! Stop!

20:34.942 --> 20:36.194
Stop.
That hurts like hell.

20:39.864 --> 20:41.199
Ah! Be careful!

20:42.408 --> 20:44.035
Stop squirming!
Just shut up and take i!

20:45.745 --> 20:47.246
Just do it fast.
It really hurts.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.084
Well, if you don't rela,
it'll hurt even more.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.585
Tomorrow, you won't be
able to walk.

20:55.588 --> 20:56.714
I don't get it either.

20:58.549 --> 20:59.217
Jeff!
