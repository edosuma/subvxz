10:39.520 --> 10:41.020
at this place right
outside of town tonight,

10:41.021 --> 10:42.531
and I was trying to get a band earlier.

10:42.532 --> 10:43.518
At this point, I'd just settle

10:43.519 --> 10:44.747
for a guitar player to help me out.

10:44.748 --> 10:46.313
Uh, either one of you able to,

- Yeah.

- Hey, I can play drums.
- That'd be great,

10:54.951 --> 10:56.808

player at this point, so...

controversy regarding...

13:01.942 --> 13:03.560
Lamar Wyatt and I...

13:03.561 --> 13:05.386
well, we had our
differences over the years.

13:05.907 --> 13:09.467
But I also wouldn't be where I
am today without his guidance.

13:10.176 --> 13:12.980
He'll be remembered as a
pillar of Nashville society,

13:12.981 --> 13:14.394

13:15.248 --> 13:16.652
May he rest in peace.

It's a lot of work, a lot of travel,

- Or anyone.

26:21.124 --> 26:24.259
but I stopped by daddy's and
picked out a few of his things.

26:24.569 --> 26:27.820
Good. The funeral director
was just asking me about that.

26:28.398 --> 26:30.421
Well, this is one of his favorites.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.754
He wore it on special occasions,

26:31.755 --> 26:33.099
and he really loved this tie

26:33.100 --> 26:34.722
that the girls gave him last Christmas.

26:35.608 --> 26:36.981
[Scoffs]

26:36.982 --> 26:40.099
I think if I had it my way,
we'd bury him in a pine box...

26:40.405 --> 26:42.074
Nowhere near mom, so...

26:42.873 --> 26:44.549
Trust me... I know exactly how you feel,

26:44.550 --> 26:46.339
given everything that
you've learned about him

26:46.340 --> 26:50.305
in the last couple days,
but... He was still our father.

26:50.306 --> 26:53.585
Tandy, he basically behaved
this way his entire life.

26:53.890 --> 26:56.178
We just found out about
the worst of it at the end.

26:57.027 --> 26:58.974
I was mad at him, too.

26:58.975 --> 27:01.953
I-I... for mom, for Peggy, for everything.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.034
But I wanted him punished, not dead.

27:05.541 --> 27:08.027
<i>You can't tell me that
you don't feel anything.</i>

27:08.028 --> 27:10.103
I feel plenty.

27:10.805 --> 27:13.098
His being dead just
doesn't change any of that.

27:14.134 --> 27:16.892
Bury him in whatever the
hell you want. I don't care.

27:23.614 --> 27:25.639
- Hey, you.
- Scarlett: Hey.

27:25.640 --> 27:26.991
I didn't even know anyone was here.

27:26.992 --> 27:28.901
Oh, just... I was trying
to catch up on some sleep.

27:28.902 --> 27:30.910
Oh, I'll bet. You've been
working such crazy hours.

27:30.911 --> 27:32.854
Your Uncle said you're like
ships passing in the night.

27:32.855 --> 27:34.011
[Chuckles] Yeah. I know.

27:35.367 --> 27:36.472
Everything okay?

27:37.278 --> 27:38.304
Yeah, yeah.

27:38.305 --> 27:39.913
Have you seen Deacon? Where is he?

27:39.914 --> 27:41.192
He's at the Bluebird, getting ready.

27:41.193 --> 27:42.185
I have dinner with a client,

27:42.186 --> 27:43.965
but, um, I may swing by afterwards.

27:43.966 --> 27:44.804
He's playing?

27:44.805 --> 27:46.289
Yeah, he got his old Thursday slot back.

27:47.584 --> 27:49.123
[Chuckling] He forgot to tell me.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.368
Where'd you go? Why'd you leave?

27:59.249 --> 28:00.790
I... Don't belong here.

28:01.612 --> 28:02.870
What are you talking about?

28:02.871 --> 28:03.759
Look...

28:04.590 --> 28:06.748
It's been an incredible journey with you.

28:07.612 --> 28:08.786
That county fair...

28:08.787 --> 28:11.402
You had such a big voice for
someone so young, remember?

28:11.403 --> 28:12.463
Whoa. What's going on?

28:12.464 --> 28:15.120
And I am so proud of how far you've come.

28:16.537 --> 28:19.815
But... It's time for me to step away.

28:19.816 --> 28:21.263
What are you talking about?

28:21.711 --> 28:22.718
Listen, you are on the verge

28:22.719 --> 28:24.918
of doing something truly incredible here.

28:24.919 --> 28:26.750
Howie V's gonna take you all the way.

28:26.751 --> 28:28.565
I can't be the deadweight holding you back.

28:28.566 --> 28:30.959
You are not deadweight.
You're not quitting.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.323
- Listen.
- It's not happening.

28:32.324 --> 28:34.065
I think that, despite all of
our battles over the years,

28:34.456 --> 28:37.196
you never doubted that I had
your best interests at heart.

28:37.197 --> 28:38.414
And that's still true.

28:38.731 --> 28:39.777
And that...

28:41.225 --> 28:42.815
That will always be true.

28:44.803 --> 28:46.762
But I got to get out of the way

28:46.763 --> 28:48.507
and let you go be a superstar.

28:49.865 --> 28:53.507
So, um, Lamar's, uh, funeral is tomorrow,

28:53.508 --> 28:54.779
and if you're finished with Howie V,

28:55.801 --> 28:58.006
your jet's at the airport
whenever you're ready to go.

29:10.108 --> 29:12.276
[Cheers and applause]

29:13.552 --> 29:14.542
Thank you.

29:15.289 --> 29:16.455
Evening, everybody.

29:16.456 --> 29:20.646
Um, as I'm sure you know, a dear
member of our Bluebird family

29:20.647 --> 29:23.387
is tonight mourning the loss of her father.

29:24.099 --> 29:25.611
If we could all just
bow our heads a moment,

29:25.612 --> 29:28.673
send some prayers towards
Rayna Jaymes and her daughters.

29:32.147 --> 29:33.491
Thank you for that.

29:34.049 --> 29:35.371
All right, before we kick this off,

29:35.372 --> 29:37.590
there's a few folks here
that, uh, I wanted to thank.

29:38.462 --> 29:41.146
Uh, Gunnar, Avery, Zoey...

29:41.460 --> 29:43.154
could y'all come up here a second?

29:43.155 --> 29:44.911
[Applause]

29:45.878 --> 29:47.262
Um, what's happening?

29:47.263 --> 29:49.284
I'm not sure, but you might
want to lose the apron.

29:49.285 --> 29:50.447
Uh, this is the younger crowd

29:50.448 --> 29:52.532
that I've been hanging out
with a little bit recently,

29:52.533 --> 29:54.247
and, uh, last night, along with the help

29:54.248 --> 29:56.565
of their, uh, very
talented friends over here,

29:56.566 --> 29:57.704
they saved my butt.

29:58.059 --> 29:59.142
Uh, but more than that,

29:59.143 --> 30:01.935
they reminded me what it is
I love about making music.

30:02.644 --> 30:04.978
It's not about the fame or being a big star

30:06.002 --> 30:08.856
or how bad your time slot is at the show.

30:08.857 --> 30:09.910
[Chuckles]

30:10.373 --> 30:12.831
It's about coming together
and bringing people together

30:13.677 --> 30:15.920
and making that sweet, sweet sound.

30:15.921 --> 30:18.021
I spoke with the guys here,
and what we'd like to do is

30:18.022 --> 30:19.146
I'd like to take these instruments,

30:19.147 --> 30:20.443
turn them over to them,

30:20.444 --> 30:22.364
let them start off this
night with one of theirs.

30:22.365 --> 30:23.381
What do you think about that?

30:23.382 --> 30:24.626
[Cheers and applause] Yep. All right.

30:26.010 --> 30:26.939

leave a little room to think

maybe they were just hiding some
of that truth to protect you.

34:39.538 --> 34:41.005
that it would be all right.

case against Lamar was dropped.

Exactly. And I couldn't
let him get away with it.

you know, being a star witness against him.

That it was her who had betrayed him.

the shock that was too much,

he was grabbing his chest.

37:40.467 --> 37:41.679
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

37:41.680 --> 37:43.816
Erika wants to see you
before you start setting up.

37:43.817 --> 37:45.947
Why? Am I in trouble because of last night?

37:45.948 --> 37:47.857
Nope. He is.

37:47.858 --> 37:49.087
What? What'd I do?

37:49.088 --> 37:51.999
Well, now that everyone knows
you sing like a young Diana Ross,

37:52.000 --> 37:54.991
your boyfriend here is gonna have to
write you a bunch of songs to sing.

37:54.992 --> 37:56.943
Hey, come on. You're no slouch
in that department, either.

37:56.944 --> 37:59.994
Yeah, I mean, Juliette Barnes
was a regular old fangirl

37:59.995 --> 38:01.543
watching you up onstage.

38:01.544 --> 38:02.719
Still not talking about it.

38:02.720 --> 38:03.883
Damn it.

38:03.884 --> 38:05.200
Last night was pretty cool, though.

38:05.513 --> 38:07.217
No, I'd say more like "awesome."

38:07.590 --> 38:09.973
I still can't believe
I sang at the Bluebird.

38:09.974 --> 38:11.392
Yes, you did.

38:11.393 --> 38:12.808
Gunnar: You know, I was thinking...

38:12.809 --> 38:14.451
Maybe the three of us could get together

38:14.452 --> 38:16.645
and... Do this again sometime.

38:17.375 --> 38:18.273
What do you think?

38:18.274 --> 38:19.424
What, you mean like a band?

38:19.425 --> 38:21.121
- Let's do it.
- Yeah. You in?

38:22.112 --> 38:23.333
What the hell?

38:23.334 --> 38:24.438
I'm in.

38:28.311 --> 38:29.558
[Cellphone chimes]

38:44.076 --> 38:45.293
[Whistling]

38:49.225 --> 38:50.415
Hey.

38:50.416 --> 38:51.540
Did you sleep here?

38:51.541 --> 38:53.759
Yes... last night, I did. Sorry.

38:54.566 --> 38:55.498
I, uh...

38:56.206 --> 38:57.934
[Chuckles] I'm just gonna go.

38:57.935 --> 38:59.177
No, hold on.

38:59.178 --> 39:00.130
Are you okay?

39:00.584 --> 39:01.826
No, I'm not.

39:01.827 --> 39:03.404
Hey, Scarlett, we're both adults.

39:03.405 --> 39:05.344
Please don't make
something out of the nothing

39:05.345 --> 39:06.429
that didn't even really happen.

39:06.731 --> 39:07.581
[Sighs]

39:08.015 --> 39:09.916
Look, I-I, uh...

39:11.471 --> 39:13.176
Went home to an empty house last night,

39:14.187 --> 39:17.512
so I thought I would go see my
Uncle Deacon at the Bluebird.

39:17.513 --> 39:18.434
He's got a spot there.

39:18.870 --> 39:21.747
And he was there with this girl

39:21.748 --> 39:24.069
I used to be very good friends
with for a really long time...

39:24.490 --> 39:25.272
Mm.

39:25.273 --> 39:27.925
<i>And my ex and also my other ex.</i>

39:28.896 --> 39:30.042
- I get it.
- Yeah.

39:30.955 --> 39:32.766
So, Deacon's up there telling everybody

39:32.767 --> 39:33.648
how great they are

39:34.087 --> 39:36.518
and how much they've
taught him about music,

39:36.519 --> 39:39.184
and, uh, I just didn't want
to be there when he got home,

39:39.527 --> 39:42.438
so I came here to, uh... [Chuckles]

39:42.439 --> 39:45.364
To worry about that nothing
that didn't happen between us.

39:45.365 --> 39:46.671
Are you worried that I would hold

39:47.478 --> 39:49.651
whatever didn't happen against you?

39:49.652 --> 39:51.270
- Ugh.
- That that's gonna affect our work?

39:54.177 --> 39:57.718
Without what we do here... our work...

40:00.443 --> 40:02.065
I don't have anything else.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.800
We're fine. We're... we're good.

40:07.367 --> 40:08.999
I'm still in your corner.

40:09.528 --> 40:11.031
I'm not going anywhere.

40:19.002 --> 40:21.176
I-I-I don't think
we should do this.

40:21.666 --> 40:23.037
Probably not.

40:32.056 --> 40:33.223
[Knock on door]

40:34.624 --> 40:35.597
Hey!

40:35.598 --> 40:36.585
You're not quitting.

40:37.069 --> 40:38.360
Juliette, wait. Hold on a second.

40:38.361 --> 40:40.372
Did you really think that
I'm gonna let you bail

40:40.373 --> 40:41.899
just when things are getting interesting?

40:41.900 --> 40:42.686
Look, I don't want you thinking...

40:42.687 --> 40:44.946
Marshall Evans, Jeff Fordham, Howie V...

40:44.947 --> 40:47.550
They all want me to be
somebody that I'm not.

40:47.551 --> 40:49.443
You are the only person

40:49.444 --> 40:52.639
who has ever stood by
my choice to be myself.

40:53.189 --> 40:55.184
I saw the proofs from the photo shoot.

40:55.185 --> 40:58.688
You never, in a million years,
would have made me do that.

40:59.064 --> 41:00.605
You know who I am.

41:00.965 --> 41:02.916
Yeah, but what about Howie V? I mean...

41:02.917 --> 41:04.976
Ken Inman did not write an article

41:04.977 --> 41:07.195
about some song with an orchestra.

41:07.196 --> 41:09.400
It's a big opportunity to pass up.

41:09.401 --> 41:10.983
Avery's version of that song...

41:12.189 --> 41:14.826
That is what I want the world to hear.

41:14.827 --> 41:18.318
It is not that tween stuff that I hated.

41:18.319 --> 41:19.693
It's got grit.

41:20.732 --> 41:23.523
And besides, Howie V seemed a little eager

41:23.524 --> 41:25.509
to get me away from country
music, and I'm sorry,

41:25.510 --> 41:27.780
but I am not willing to
pull the stakes up yet.

41:28.982 --> 41:30.727
<i>And you shouldn't be, either.</i>

42:05.853 --> 42:06.926
[Gasps]

42:09.023 --> 42:10.244
Aah!

42:11.813 --> 42:12.932
[Wailing]

42:14.337 --> 42:16.040
[Wailing continues]

42:20.423 --> 42:21.771
[Glass breaking]

42:22.825 --> 42:25.181
[Sobbing]

42:34.171 --> 42:35.843
It's got to stop.

42:37.525 --> 42:42.260
[Sobbing] All the lying just has to stop!

42:42.861 --> 42:45.084
Please!
