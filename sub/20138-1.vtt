01:05.515 --> 01:09.713
I beg your pardon. Was that your leg?
I had no idea we were going into a tunnel.

01:09.786 --> 01:11.651
I thought the compartment was empty.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.983
I'm so sorry. I hope I didn't hurt you.

01:18.862 --> 01:21.558
Awful man in the next compartment
smoking a vile cigar.

01:22.632 --> 01:25.624
I had to come in here.
You don't smoke, do you?

01:25.702 --> 01:28.296
-No, I don't.
-Thank heavens for that.

01:28.371 --> 01:32.307
After last night, my head couldn't stand it.
You understand....

01:42.051 --> 01:44.349
May I see your tickets, please?

01:51.027 --> 01:52.153
Thank you, miss.

01:54.063 --> 01:56.395
I'm afraid
you're in the wrong compartment, sir.

01:56.466 --> 01:58.457
-It's a first-class compartment, isn't it?
-Yes.

01:58.535 --> 02:00.628
-Then I'm all right.
-It's a third-class ticket.

02:03.406 --> 02:07.103
What sort of line is this, selling
third-class tickets at first-class prices?

02:07.177 --> 02:08.804
I am very sorry, sir.

02:08.877 --> 02:11.870
That will be £5.04 extra.

02:12.115 --> 02:14.583
-You haven't change for a fiver, have you?
-Yes, sir.

02:14.651 --> 02:17.381
Don't bother, because I haven't got one.

02:21.491 --> 02:23.516
This is the best I can do.

02:23.626 --> 02:27.187
Do you suppose the line would settle for
£5 and tuppence ha'penny?

02:29.666 --> 02:31.361
No, I don't suppose they would.

02:36.639 --> 02:39.972
I hate to presume on our short
acquaintance, but have you any change?

02:40.543 --> 02:42.909
I'm afraid that I....

02:44.747 --> 02:47.409
There you are. That'll do. That stamp.

02:48.751 --> 02:49.979
Thank you very much.

02:50.053 --> 02:53.352
There you are, £5 and tuppence ha'penny
and three ha'pence. £5.04.

02:55.558 --> 02:57.685
It's legaI tender, old boy.

03:01.331 --> 03:03.162
Write to your mother.

03:06.035 --> 03:07.127
That man.

03:40.370 --> 03:42.463
Mr. Aysgarth, may I?

03:42.538 --> 03:46.167
Would you mind stepping forward
a little bit, Mrs. Fitzpatrick? Thank you.

03:46.242 --> 03:48.267
Now, Mr. Aysgarth, please.

03:49.812 --> 03:52.872
I wonder if I could have
a little bit more of your smile?

03:52.949 --> 03:55.281
Not at this hour of the morning.

03:56.286 --> 03:58.584
-There he is. Good morning, Johnnie.
-How are you?

03:58.655 --> 04:01.021
-We've been looking for you everywhere.
-Everywhere.

04:01.090 --> 04:03.957
Excuse me.
If it's possible at all, would you mind?

04:04.027 --> 04:07.121
Of course. I'm so sorry.
See you later, Johnnie. Goodbye.

04:07.196 --> 04:10.495
-Come, Alice. Come, Jessie.
-Thank you very much.

04:10.566 --> 04:13.501
Aren't they bright this morning? Now.

04:13.569 --> 04:15.799
That's very good.

04:15.872 --> 04:19.238
Now could I have a little bit of a smile?
You remember.

04:30.186 --> 04:32.950
I can hardly believe it.
It can't be the same girl.

04:34.791 --> 04:36.588
What's her name? Do you know her?

04:36.659 --> 04:40.527
Yes, but lay off, Johnnie.
You've enough on your hands for one day.

04:40.596 --> 04:42.791
Besides, she's not up your aIley.

04:42.865 --> 04:46.062
To tell you the truth,
I'm a little bored with people in my aIley.

04:46.135 --> 04:48.330
-Introduce me to her, will you?
-Certainly not.

04:48.404 --> 04:50.395
She's a very carefully brought up
young lady.

04:50.473 --> 04:52.532
If you won't do it, I'll have to do it myself.

04:52.608 --> 04:53.870
Come on, they're going.

05:19.102 --> 05:22.162
-Lina, may we come in?
-I'm sorry. I didn't see you.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.331
-How are you?
-Splendid.

05:25.808 --> 05:28.003
May I introduce Mr. Aysgarth?

05:31.547 --> 05:33.174
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

05:33.249 --> 05:35.683
We were just passing by
and we saw you in the window.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.550
-Johnnie insisted on meeting you.
-Why?

05:38.621 --> 05:42.853
I'm told the sight of a reaIly eligible male
is a rare treat in this part of the country.

05:43.259 --> 05:45.853
-Isn't Johnnie terrible?
-He's too fantastic for words.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.054
Aren't you, Johnnie?

05:48.231 --> 05:51.029
-Hadn't you better hurry?
-Hurry for what?

05:51.467 --> 05:53.230
You don't want to be late for church.

05:53.302 --> 05:56.931
-Did you all come to take me to church?
-No, but that is....

05:57.006 --> 05:59.873
-If you want to come....
-NaturaIly, we'd love to have you.

06:00.910 --> 06:03.845
That's very kind of you. I think I will come.

06:03.913 --> 06:08.441
Good. And put on that saucy little hat
you wore on the train the other day.

06:08.518 --> 06:11.851
I will. Excuse me.
I'll be down in a moment.

06:12.188 --> 06:14.349
We'd better sit down, girls.

06:32.008 --> 06:34.067
-Where are you rushing to?
-To church, Mother.

06:34.143 --> 06:35.770
-But I thought--
-I've changed my mind.

06:35.845 --> 06:38.336
-Shall I go with you?
-I'm going with the Barhams.

06:38.414 --> 06:40.780
-I thought you didn't like them.
-I loathe them.

06:44.020 --> 06:45.817
ReaIly, it's most extraordinary.

07:12.949 --> 07:15.918
-You're not reaIly going to church?
-I certainly am.

07:15.985 --> 07:19.148
-No, you're coming for a walk with me.
-Don't be ridiculous.

07:19.222 --> 07:22.749
Tell you what I'll do, I'll toss you for it.
Heads you do, tails you don't.

07:27.797 --> 07:28.991
Mother.

07:40.510 --> 07:43.741
Now what did you think
I was trying to do, kill you?

07:43.813 --> 07:46.873
Nothing less than murder could justify
such violent self-defense.

07:46.949 --> 07:48.382
-Look at you.
-Let me go.

07:50.853 --> 07:54.414
I'm just beginning to understand.
You thought I was going to kiss you.

07:54.490 --> 07:56.651
-Weren't you?
-Of course not.

07:56.726 --> 07:59.627
I was merely reaching around you,
trying to fix your hair.

07:59.695 --> 08:02.926
-What's wrong with my hair?
-I'm glad you asked me that.

08:02.999 --> 08:06.400
It would have been very discourteous
for me to bring the subject up.

08:06.469 --> 08:09.336
-Are you serious?
-Of course I'm serious.

08:09.972 --> 08:13.464
I may seem provinciaI, but frankly,
I can't understand men like you.

08:13.543 --> 08:16.535
You always give me the feeling
that you're laughing at me.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.611
No, I give you my word.

08:19.682 --> 08:21.343
But your hair's all wrong.

08:21.417 --> 08:24.875
It has such wonderful possibilities
that I got excited.

08:25.288 --> 08:28.519
For the moment,
I became a passionate hairdresser.

08:28.591 --> 08:31.321
-What's wrong with it?
-Let me show you.

08:33.129 --> 08:34.494
Let me see....

08:36.365 --> 08:38.525
-Don't do that.
-Why not?

08:39.001 --> 08:41.868
Because your ucipitaI mapilary
is quite beautiful.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.372
What's an ucipitaI mapilary?

08:46.509 --> 08:48.943
-That.
-You don't need to touch it.

08:50.713 --> 08:52.044
Let's see.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.514
That's good.

09:00.723 --> 09:03.521
I must be quite a novelty
by contrast with the women...

09:03.593 --> 09:05.185
that you're photographed with.

09:07.129 --> 09:09.962
What do you think of me
by contrast to your horse?

09:10.032 --> 09:14.628
If I ever got the bit between your teeth,
I'd have no trouble in handling you at all.

09:15.871 --> 09:18.396
Suppose just as you thought
you had me under control...

09:18.474 --> 09:20.601
I turned around, neighed, and kissed you?

09:20.676 --> 09:22.940
I think you've done enough fooling
with my hair.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.348
You don't look very good like that.

09:29.418 --> 09:32.012
You look more like a monkey
with a bit of mirror.

09:32.088 --> 09:34.921
What does your family call you?
Monkeyface?

09:36.859 --> 09:39.123
I still think my way was best.

09:44.467 --> 09:47.061
I must go now or I'll be late to luncheon.

09:47.136 --> 09:50.902
If my father saw me come in both late
and beautiful, he might have a stroke.

10:01.951 --> 10:05.580
-Please don't bother to come any further.
-I'll be back for you at 3:00.

10:05.655 --> 10:09.056
-No, reaIly, I can't come out this afternoon.
-Yes, you can.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.992
No, reaIly,
I have to make calls with my mother.

10:12.295 --> 10:13.887
-Liar.
-ReaIly.

10:14.463 --> 10:16.397
Don't forget, 3:00.

10:17.767 --> 10:20.201
Lina will never marry.
She's not the marrying sort.

10:20.269 --> 10:21.293
She has no need to worry.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.702
There's enough to care for her
the rest of her life.

10:23.773 --> 10:26.936
I suppose you're right, dear.
I'm afraid she's rather spinsterish.

10:27.009 --> 10:30.206
What's wrong with that?
The old maid's a respectable institution.

10:30.279 --> 10:34.340
All women are not alike. Lina has intellect
and a fine solid character.

10:34.417 --> 10:35.645
Come on, I'm hungry.

11:02.378 --> 11:03.606
Sorry I'm late.

11:06.782 --> 11:08.841
Could I have some well-done,
please, Burton?

11:08.918 --> 11:10.010
Yes, miss.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.077
What kept you so long at church, dear?

11:13.022 --> 11:17.083
I didn't go to church.
I went for a walk. Thank you, Burton.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.857
-With a man.
-A man?

11:20.763 --> 11:23.027
Yes. His name's John Aysgarth.

11:23.265 --> 11:26.098
-John Aysgarth?
-Is that Tom Aysgarth's boy?

11:26.168 --> 11:27.897
How'd you meet him?

11:27.970 --> 11:31.030
Pity he's turned out so wild.
Rough luck on Tom.

11:31.107 --> 11:34.770
What's this, horseradish?
Didn't know horseradish was in season.

11:34.844 --> 11:37.677
-It's not out of a bottle, is it?
-Of course not, dear.

11:37.747 --> 11:39.874
That's reaI.
I can tell the difference at once.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.918
I can't stand things out of bottles.
They never taste the same.

11:42.985 --> 11:44.384
Never, dear.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.753
Why did you say
that John Aysgarth was wild, Father?

11:47.823 --> 11:50.951
He was turned out of some club
for cheating at cards, wasn't he?

11:53.095 --> 11:55.427
I don't know. I didn't ask him.

11:55.498 --> 11:58.092
Or ought to have been.
Something unpleasant anyway.

11:58.167 --> 12:00.931
-What's he doing down here?
-Staying at Penshaze.

12:01.003 --> 12:02.903
Lord Middleham
wouldn't have him there...

12:02.972 --> 12:05.236
if he had been turned out of a club
for cheating.

12:05.307 --> 12:08.208
Maybe it wasn't cards. Maybe a woman.

12:08.611 --> 12:10.841
He was corespondent or something,
I believe...

12:10.913 --> 12:12.505
or ought to have been corespondent.

12:12.581 --> 12:15.414
You can't expect me to remember
every detail about everybody.

12:15.484 --> 12:19.682
Anyway, I'm going to see him again.
He's caIling for me this afternoon at 3:00.

12:23.926 --> 12:26.224
You're wanted on the telephone, miss.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.198
Hello?

12:36.572 --> 12:37.800
Hello, Johnnie.

12:39.041 --> 12:40.372
You can't?

12:43.979 --> 12:45.606
Of course, I understand.

12:46.582 --> 12:47.947
Thank you for caIling.

12:50.453 --> 12:52.614
I'd love to,
next time you come down again.

13:28.257 --> 13:29.451
Hello?

13:29.825 --> 13:32.350
Is Mr. John Aysgarth there, please?

13:33.362 --> 13:34.624
He isn't?

13:34.964 --> 13:36.955
I thought perhaps....

13:37.333 --> 13:40.063
Are you expecting him for the Hunt Ball?

13:40.870 --> 13:44.738
This is.... It doesn't matter. I'll ring again.

13:46.842 --> 13:49.538
-Nothing, Miss McLaidlaw.
-Are you sure?

13:50.846 --> 13:53.679
-Positive.
-I don't want to be a nuisance...

13:53.749 --> 13:57.446
but couldn't it accidentaIly have been
put into somebody else's letter box?

13:57.520 --> 14:01.081
I'm sorry, I'm sure it would have been
returned if that had happened.

14:01.156 --> 14:02.487
Thank you.

14:12.501 --> 14:14.628
Regent 0021, please.

14:20.543 --> 14:21.840
No reply?

14:22.845 --> 14:24.176
Thank you.

14:53.642 --> 14:55.667
-Lina.
-Hello, Mother.

14:58.280 --> 14:59.645
It's 7:00.

15:01.283 --> 15:03.342
Aren't you going to wear your new dress?

15:03.819 --> 15:06.151
No, Mother. I'm not in the mood.

15:06.655 --> 15:09.715
-What's the matter, dear?
-My head's splitting.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.985
I'm not going to the ball.

15:13.429 --> 15:16.887
Not going? You mean....
What'll your father say?

15:17.166 --> 15:19.134
Perhaps some aspirin....

15:20.235 --> 15:23.102
-You haven't a temperature, have you?
-I don't know.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.332
Yes, come in.

15:25.240 --> 15:28.175
-Where's your aspirin? I'll get it.
-In my bureau drawer.

15:28.744 --> 15:31.372
-A telegram for you, miss.
-Thank you.

15:59.475 --> 16:01.773
-Here's the aspirin, dear.
-What for?

16:01.977 --> 16:04.104
-Your headache.
-That's gone.

16:04.179 --> 16:08.548
-Tell Father I'll be down in a second.
-ReaIly, I don't understand you.

16:53.896 --> 16:55.454
I say, Lina.

16:56.231 --> 16:58.461
-Yes, Reggie?
-What about our dance?

16:58.534 --> 17:01.628
-Why, of course. Poor Reggie.
-Good.

17:08.042 --> 17:10.978
I say, GeneraI, that's not Lina
dancing with Wetherby, is it?

17:11.046 --> 17:14.378
-Yes, it is.
-By Jove, I didn't recognize her at first.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.384
I hardly knew her myself.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.750
There's somebody at the door
for GeneraI McLaidlaw.

17:18.820 --> 17:22.916
There's somebody to see you at the door.
This is GeneraI McLaidlaw.

17:22.991 --> 17:24.390
I beg your pardon, sir.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.452
There's a gentleman at the door
who says he's with your party.

17:27.529 --> 17:30.362
He has no card, sir. The name is Aysgarth.

17:30.766 --> 17:33.257
Aysgarth? Must be a mistake.

17:35.404 --> 17:38.498
GeneraI McLaidlaw? I'm John Aysgarth.

17:38.941 --> 17:42.468
I don't recall having invited you
in my party.

17:43.112 --> 17:44.909
How awkward. I thought you had.

17:44.980 --> 17:47.574
Otherwise I should never have come
all the way from London.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.174
I don't know what to say.

17:50.252 --> 17:53.517
I suggest you say something before
you embarrass this poor man to death.

17:59.194 --> 18:00.752
-Hello, Johnnie.
-Hello, Lina.

18:00.829 --> 18:03.525
-Hello, Johnnie.
-We were wondering if you were coming.

18:03.599 --> 18:06.397
I'm sorry I'm late.
I believe this is our dance, isn't it?

18:15.811 --> 18:17.870
-Hello, Monkeyface.
-Hello.

18:41.670 --> 18:43.729
But we can't do this. Where are we going?

18:43.806 --> 18:46.536
-Which is your car?
-This is ridiculous.

18:47.042 --> 18:49.169
-Over there.
-Good. Come on.

18:52.447 --> 18:54.415
Roll up the window before you catch cold.

19:05.727 --> 19:08.560
Have you ever been kissed in a car before?

19:08.797 --> 19:10.822
-Johnnie.
-Johnnie what?

19:11.266 --> 19:14.235
You mustn't joke with me.
I'm no good at joking.

19:14.303 --> 19:17.101
-I don't know how to flirt.
-I'm not joking. I'm serious.

19:17.172 --> 19:20.073
-Have you ever been kissed in a car?
-Never.

19:25.948 --> 19:27.745
Would you like to be?

19:28.584 --> 19:29.642
Yes.

19:41.196 --> 19:45.064
You're the first woman I've ever met
who said yes when she meant yes.

19:45.133 --> 19:48.762
-What do the others say?
-Hanged if I know. Anything but yes.

19:48.837 --> 19:51.362
-But they kiss you?
-UsuaIly.

19:52.307 --> 19:55.401
-Have there....
-Have there what, Monkeyface?

19:56.211 --> 19:59.578
-Have there been many?
-I'm afraid so. Quite a few.

20:00.182 --> 20:03.151
One night, when I couldn't fall asleep,
I started to count them.

20:03.218 --> 20:05.812
The way you count sheep
jumping over a fence.

20:05.888 --> 20:08.322
I think I passed out on number 73.

20:09.625 --> 20:13.618
-Are you always frank with them like this?
-No, not particularly.

20:14.129 --> 20:16.996
Why are you frank with me,
because I'm different?

20:17.065 --> 20:18.760
No, it isn't that.

20:18.834 --> 20:23.100
I'm honest because with you
I think it's the best way to get results.

20:25.374 --> 20:29.037
I hope I'm not saying the wrong thing,
but I love you.

20:33.382 --> 20:36.545
No, you haven't said
the wrong thing, Monkeyface.

20:37.819 --> 20:40.754
-Where are we going?
-I don't know, anywhere.

20:41.523 --> 20:44.788
I think I'm faIling in love with you
and I don't quite like it.

20:44.860 --> 20:46.987
That's why I stayed away from you
for a week.

20:47.062 --> 20:48.359
I was afraid of you.

20:49.898 --> 20:52.025
I didn't think it would happen like this.

20:52.100 --> 20:55.092
Neither did I.
I saw an entirely different sort of person.

20:55.170 --> 20:57.934
-So did I.
-I pictured it all rather conventionaIly.

20:58.006 --> 21:01.134
We'd meet at a garden party,
he'd call on me in the evenings...

21:01.209 --> 21:04.645
and we'd go for rides together,
and then afterward we'd....

21:04.713 --> 21:07.614
We're coming to my house.
Would you like to stop for a drink?

21:07.683 --> 21:08.707
No.

21:09.084 --> 21:12.815
I'm going to get you back to that ball
as fast as possible.

21:21.129 --> 21:22.357
Get out.

21:26.735 --> 21:28.532
Why have you stopped?

21:28.837 --> 21:30.737
I'm sure I don't know.

21:32.307 --> 21:33.569
Come on.

21:39.982 --> 21:42.815
-Good evening, Burton.
-I saw you coming up the drive, miss.

21:42.884 --> 21:45.546
We won't be needing you.
We just stopped in for a drink.

21:45.620 --> 21:47.554
-Very good.
-Shall we go in the study?

21:50.125 --> 21:53.686
You sit down. I'll mix you a drink.
I think you need one.

21:55.597 --> 21:57.462
You must be made of iron.

21:57.532 --> 21:59.363
-Why?
-How can you be so calm?

21:59.434 --> 22:01.402
Look at me. I'm shaking.

22:01.603 --> 22:05.767
-The least you could do is swoon away.
-I know. I'm rather surprised myself.

22:06.508 --> 22:09.341
I think it's because
for the first time in my life...

22:09.411 --> 22:11.140
I know what I want.

22:27.229 --> 22:29.026
Are you courting me?

22:30.999 --> 22:32.591
I'm afraid I am.

22:34.169 --> 22:36.262
This is a wonderful moment.

22:37.105 --> 22:40.563
Here we are in my home,
the house that I was born in...

22:41.610 --> 22:44.875
alone and together in my favorite room.

22:45.313 --> 22:47.178
Do you like this room?

22:47.682 --> 22:49.013
Very much.

22:54.156 --> 22:56.386
Well, what are you doing here?

23:00.295 --> 23:02.855
I say, old boy,
isn't that going a bit too far?

23:05.801 --> 23:07.428
-He doesn't like me.
-I know.

23:10.505 --> 23:13.565
He doesn't trust me from here to there.
Do you?

23:14.242 --> 23:18.508
You're right. Stop it before it's too late.
Tell her everything you're thinking.

23:19.047 --> 23:22.312
That I'm no good to her,
I can only bring her unhappiness.

23:22.384 --> 23:25.285
Warn her. Speak up, man.
It's your last chance.

23:26.855 --> 23:28.117
Hear him?

23:28.557 --> 23:30.184
Very distinctly.

23:30.792 --> 23:35.593
He's not exaggerating a thing, dear.
It's all true, every word he isn't saying.

23:36.731 --> 23:38.460
I love him, Father.

23:39.167 --> 23:41.362
-Did you see him jump?
-I did.

23:45.941 --> 23:47.465
Watch this one.

23:49.044 --> 23:53.276
Sir, I have the honor of asking
for your daughter's hand in marriage.

23:55.117 --> 23:57.108
What do you say to that?

24:02.691 --> 24:05.216
You heard him that time, didn't you?

24:06.161 --> 24:08.186
It doesn't matter.

24:09.564 --> 24:11.156
Poor Monkeyface.

24:18.507 --> 24:20.372
Do you hear the music?

24:20.575 --> 24:22.065
Very clearly.

24:23.678 --> 24:27.341
Let's dance, before I.... Before we....

24:28.083 --> 24:29.482
Let's dance.

25:16.731 --> 25:19.199
I was just going down to the post.

25:20.135 --> 25:23.571
Could you stop at Marshall's
and get me more of this green wool?

25:23.638 --> 25:25.265
Where'd I put it?

25:28.910 --> 25:30.309
Here it is.

25:30.679 --> 25:34.638
Be sure it's the same green.
Better take it out into the daylight.

25:34.716 --> 25:36.115
Yes, Mother.

25:42.357 --> 25:46.384
-Is there anything I can do for you?
-No, there's nothing I want.

26:07.916 --> 26:10.043
Don't be late for tea, dear.

27:02.437 --> 27:04.234
That trunk goes up on the landing.

27:05.907 --> 27:08.205
How do you like it, Mrs. Aysgarth?

27:08.276 --> 27:10.744
If you don't like it,
just blame it all on Mr. Bailey.

27:10.812 --> 27:13.645
He rented it during our honeymoon.
He decorated the place.

27:13.715 --> 27:17.651
-But if you do like it--
-I adore it. I'm mad about it. It's wonderful.

27:17.719 --> 27:19.744
In that case,
you're talking to the right man.

27:19.821 --> 27:24.019
-Because I engaged Mr. Bailey, didn't I?
-Yes, Mr. Aysgarth. That's true, I must say.

27:24.092 --> 27:25.753
Johnnie, you're a genius.

27:25.827 --> 27:29.092
Mr. Aysgarth,
I shall have to be getting along now.

27:29.764 --> 27:31.664
What shall we do about the bill?

27:31.733 --> 27:35.169
Will you drop it on that pretty little table
on your way out, old boy?

27:35.236 --> 27:36.794
Yes. Thank you.

27:45.580 --> 27:49.016
And may I wish you both
the very best of everything.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.416
-Thank you.
-Goodbye, Mr. Bailey.

27:53.088 --> 27:56.057
I never dreamt I would have
such a gorgeous place.

27:56.124 --> 27:58.422
Are you sure you can afford it?

27:59.294 --> 28:01.922
-I've forgotten your name.
-Ethel, sir.

28:02.564 --> 28:05.499
-Well, Ethel, what about some tea?
-Very good, sir.

28:06.801 --> 28:08.962
-What do you think of Ethel?
-She seems perfect.

28:09.037 --> 28:11.130
-Are you sure--
-Let's go in the drawing room.

28:24.018 --> 28:26.213
-Where are we?
-The Hunt Ball.

28:26.721 --> 28:28.484
-Where else?
-Venice.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.113
And?

28:30.191 --> 28:33.627
And Naples, and Capri,
and Monte Carlo, and Nice.

28:33.695 --> 28:35.094
-And?
-Paris.

28:35.163 --> 28:36.289
Paris.

28:38.133 --> 28:42.035
-I beg your pardon. A telegram for you, sir.
-Thank you, Ethel.

28:49.611 --> 28:51.306
It isn't bad news, is it, dear?

28:51.379 --> 28:54.473
An old friend of mine.
Stupid fellow, he wants £1,000.

28:54.549 --> 28:58.576
-You couldn't spare £1,000, could you?
-What does he want it for?

28:59.454 --> 29:02.753
Hanged if I know.
Probably because I borrowed it from him.

29:02.824 --> 29:04.121
You borrowed it? Why?

29:04.192 --> 29:07.491
I was going on a honeymoon
with the loveliest girl in the world...

29:07.562 --> 29:10.531
and I wanted her to be happy.
Was she happy?

29:11.266 --> 29:14.827
-Didn't you have any money of your own?
-Not a shilling.

29:16.704 --> 29:19.070
But I thought.... I had the impression....

29:19.140 --> 29:22.200
Don't worry your darling little head
about it today of all days.

29:22.277 --> 29:24.837
I'll take care of old Henry somehow.

29:24.913 --> 29:27.108
I still don't understand.

29:27.949 --> 29:29.473
Are you broke?

29:30.185 --> 29:33.279
Monkeyface, I've been broke all my life.

29:33.922 --> 29:37.949
Why didn't you tell me?
Every time I brought the subject up, you....

29:38.026 --> 29:41.018
Whatever made you
take this extravagant house?

29:41.095 --> 29:43.529
I didn't think you'd want to live in a shack.

29:43.598 --> 29:47.364
A girl like you is going to come into
plenty of money someday.

29:47.435 --> 29:50.700
Wait a minute,
I can't quite get this into my head.

29:50.772 --> 29:53.673
Were you thinking
of my inheritance when....

29:54.075 --> 29:56.100
I don't know what to say.

29:56.177 --> 29:57.974
Now, darling, reaIly.

29:58.279 --> 30:01.646
Isn't it silly to spend
the best years of our lives waiting?

30:01.716 --> 30:03.308
Why not be comfortable now?

30:04.452 --> 30:05.817
Johnnie...

30:06.321 --> 30:08.915
I'm just beginning to understand you.

30:09.257 --> 30:10.747
You're a baby.

30:11.326 --> 30:15.729
I know you didn't marry me for my money.
You'd have done much better elsewhere.

30:15.930 --> 30:19.093
But my income
will never pay for all this. Never.

30:21.636 --> 30:23.570
What about your father?

30:25.707 --> 30:29.108
I couldn't possibly ask my father.
Or even my mother.

30:29.344 --> 30:33.144
You saw how restrained she was
when she met us at the station.

30:33.214 --> 30:37.548
Anyway, you wouldn't actuaIly
want to live on your wife's aIlowance?

30:38.186 --> 30:40.711
-Of course not, darling.
-Well, then?

30:42.590 --> 30:43.955
Answer me, Johnnie.

30:47.562 --> 30:51.328
I suppose if the worst comes to the worst
and there's no other way out...

30:51.399 --> 30:53.594
-I suppose I'll have to....
-What?

30:53.668 --> 30:56.569
Borrow some more.
I haven't touched old Middleham yet.

30:56.638 --> 30:59.402
He ought to be good
for a month or two's housekeeping.

31:01.042 --> 31:03.033
I think you must be mad.

31:05.480 --> 31:08.938
Marrying you is the sanest thing
I ever did in my life.

31:13.354 --> 31:14.787
Come on, give it to me.

31:14.856 --> 31:17.723
-That's too heavy for a little girl like you.
-Thank you, sir.

31:17.792 --> 31:19.555
Clear off the table.

31:23.431 --> 31:26.264
Here, take that. Is there any cake?

31:27.035 --> 31:29.629
-Yes, sir.
-Go along, get it.

31:29.704 --> 31:31.501
Here, dear. Come on.

31:37.478 --> 31:38.467
Thank you.

31:42.984 --> 31:45.111
There's going to be no more borrowing.

31:45.186 --> 31:48.553
-What else is there to do?
-You've got to go to work.

31:49.290 --> 31:50.757
-Work?
-Yes, work.

31:52.126 --> 31:54.754
You mean put on old clothes,
go out with a shovel?

31:54.829 --> 31:56.296
Don't be flippant.

31:56.364 --> 31:57.729
Then what do you mean?

31:58.666 --> 32:02.602
I'm afraid you're a bit of a dreamer.
Let's be practicaI about this.

32:02.670 --> 32:04.865
Do you know the statistics
on unemployment?

32:04.939 --> 32:09.433
Do you realize in order to be a plumber,
or a carpenter, or an electrician....

32:09.510 --> 32:11.637
Darling, you haven't been around.

32:11.713 --> 32:14.181
They have to be apprentices first.
Even after that....

32:14.248 --> 32:17.274
-Darling.
-There are all sorts of jobs.

32:17.352 --> 32:20.583
I'm broad-minded.
Let's have some tea and then talk it over.

32:20.655 --> 32:23.852
I could make out a list of jobs.
It might be fun.

32:24.359 --> 32:27.294
I'll get a pencil and paper.
Excuse me, dear.

32:31.633 --> 32:32.827
It's right there behind you.

32:33.334 --> 32:34.323
Hello?

32:35.236 --> 32:36.726
Hello, Mother.

32:37.305 --> 32:40.604
Yes, it's wonderful.
A most beautiful house.

32:41.743 --> 32:44.439
Would you tell Father how badly I felt?

32:45.747 --> 32:49.183
He is? Wait a minute till I tell Johnnie.

32:49.250 --> 32:53.744
Father's sending us a wedding present.
Mother told him how happy I looked and....

32:53.821 --> 32:56.255
I can't tell you how much
this means to me.

32:56.324 --> 32:58.918
-Me, too.
-Yes. Father?

33:01.129 --> 33:05.259
-Come on, ask him when he's sending it.
-It's coming right away, by messenger.

33:05.333 --> 33:08.632
Invite them over for dinner.
Perhaps he'd like to play some golf.

33:08.703 --> 33:12.104
Tell him that we were in the throes
of job-hunting when he telephoned.

33:12.173 --> 33:16.337
-It doesn't hurt to impress the old boy.
-ReaIly, you are the limit.

33:16.744 --> 33:19.178
How can you be so gay about something...

33:19.247 --> 33:21.477
that you should be ashamed of?

33:21.816 --> 33:23.283
What, Father?

33:23.584 --> 33:26.485
Yes, Johnnie and I were just having...

33:26.821 --> 33:30.450
a sober and comprehensive discussion
of that very subject.

33:30.658 --> 33:34.321
He has severaI ideas of the kind of job
he'd like to do...

33:34.696 --> 33:36.994
and severaI good opportunities.

33:38.566 --> 33:40.966
There's a messenger
from GeneraI McLaidlaw.

33:41.035 --> 33:44.300
-Bring it in.
-It's just come, Father. Hold on, do.

33:47.375 --> 33:50.833
I think I know what it is,
and if it is what I think it is...

33:50.912 --> 33:52.880
Johnnie, you'll be thrilled.

33:52.947 --> 33:55.108
It is! How wonderful.

33:56.017 --> 33:58.850
We've had them in the family
before I was born.

33:58.920 --> 34:02.219
Father's had lots of offers to sell them,
but he never would.

34:03.791 --> 34:07.124
-How many more, for heaven's sake?
-Just these two, sir.

34:07.195 --> 34:09.129
He sent us both of them.

34:09.197 --> 34:11.824
These are Father's
most precious possessions.

34:11.899 --> 34:13.331
You don't say.

34:13.400 --> 34:16.734
These will be our first heirlooms
to be handed down to our children...

34:16.804 --> 34:21.297
-and then to their children.
-That's the thing to do with them, all right.

34:23.311 --> 34:27.110
Father, you're so good to me
that you make me want to cry.

34:32.018 --> 34:33.509
What was that?

34:34.722 --> 34:37.020
Yes, you've made me very happy.

34:39.260 --> 34:41.784
You've made Johnnie very happy, too.

34:44.065 --> 34:46.862
Just a minute, he wants to say something.

34:48.235 --> 34:52.172
Say something very nice.
These chairs reaIly belong in a museum.

34:52.239 --> 34:53.502
Hello, GeneraI.

34:53.574 --> 34:57.305
Yes, but reaIly, shouldn't you
have sent them to a museum?

34:57.612 --> 35:00.445
NaturaIly we're thrilled. Who wouldn't be?

35:00.882 --> 35:02.315
What, a job?

35:02.784 --> 35:07.551
Yes, Lina and I were just going into that.
I have some excellent opportunities.

35:07.822 --> 35:09.653
What are they?

35:11.259 --> 35:14.456
I've just received a letter
from my cousin, Captain Melbeck.

35:14.529 --> 35:16.588
Yes, he is a splendid chap.

35:17.165 --> 35:21.226
He wants someone to manage his estate.
I thought I'd take the job.

35:21.302 --> 35:23.099
I'm glad you approve.

35:23.271 --> 35:26.729
Yes, we must. We'll get together soon.
I'll leave it up to Lina, shall I?

35:26.808 --> 35:28.776
All right. Goodbye, sir.

35:31.179 --> 35:34.273
That was a fib about Captain Melbeck,
wasn't it?

35:34.348 --> 35:35.576
Was it?

35:46.127 --> 35:49.221
-Did you have this letter all the time?
-I did.

35:50.131 --> 35:52.031
Why didn't you tell me?

35:52.834 --> 35:55.632
Because, dear,
I never dreamed I'd be using it...

35:55.703 --> 36:00.197
any more than I ever dreamed we'd be
receiving these two beautiful chairs.

36:18.526 --> 36:21.723
Hello. It's a nice place
old Johnnie's got here.

36:21.796 --> 36:25.562
It's an old Georgian house, isn't it?
I bet it cost him a packet to redecorate.

36:25.633 --> 36:27.965
-Who are you?
-I'm Beaky Thwaite.

36:28.970 --> 36:31.939
-You must be old Johnnie's wife.
-Yes, I am.

36:32.173 --> 36:34.141
Didn't he ever tell you about me?

36:34.208 --> 36:36.574
You're Beaky.

36:36.644 --> 36:38.635
That's what they used to call me at school.

36:38.713 --> 36:41.910
I happened to be driving by.
I thought I'd pop in for a cup of tea.

36:41.983 --> 36:43.974
I've heard so much about you,
Mr. Thwaite.

36:44.051 --> 36:45.609
Johnnie told me about you, too.

36:45.686 --> 36:48.018
I ran into him at Newbury Races last week.

36:49.090 --> 36:50.421
The races?

36:50.524 --> 36:53.186
Put my foot in it as usuaI, have I?
Didn't he tell you?

36:54.362 --> 36:57.058
Johnnie has a job.
He couldn't have been at the races.

36:57.131 --> 36:58.462
Besides, he's given up betting.

36:58.532 --> 37:00.830
He has, has he?
Don't you believe it, not Johnnie.

37:00.902 --> 37:04.702
He's a great lad, he is.
You mustn't mind Johnnie cutting up.

37:04.772 --> 37:06.433
That's what makes him Johnnie.

37:06.507 --> 37:09.032
Besides, he thinks you're a topper,
he does.

37:09.143 --> 37:12.874
-I think so, too.
-Won't you sit down?

37:12.947 --> 37:15.711
I don't see why not. Something wrong?

37:15.850 --> 37:19.183
Yes. There were two chairs here
this morning before I left.

37:19.253 --> 37:21.847
Chairs? Disappeared, have they?

37:22.423 --> 37:24.050
Yes, apparently.

37:25.192 --> 37:28.889
-Were they expensive?
-Yes, they were museum pieces.

37:31.499 --> 37:36.129
That Johnnie, he'll be the death of me.
Don't you understand?

37:36.404 --> 37:39.532
-No, I don't.
-I bet you 20-to-1 that Johnnie sold them.

37:39.607 --> 37:41.074
Sold them? What for?

37:41.142 --> 37:44.578
For money, of course. A fellow's got to pay
his racing debts, hasn't he?

37:44.645 --> 37:47.808
Johnnie dropped a packet of money
at Newbury, I can tell you that.

37:47.882 --> 37:51.750
These bookies don't trust a chap for long.
Not a chap like Johnnie, that is.

37:51.819 --> 37:55.186
I don't believe you.
I don't believe a word you're saying.

37:55.256 --> 37:56.985
Put my foot in it again, have I?

37:57.058 --> 38:01.552
My dear, you mustn't take it so seriously.
After all, it's Johnnie.

38:02.163 --> 38:06.395
Wonderful chap, there's nobody like him.
But I needn't tell you that.

38:06.567 --> 38:10.731
He couldn't have sold them.
He wouldn't, without asking me.

38:11.305 --> 38:14.103
Here he comes.
Don't tell him I've said a word.

38:14.175 --> 38:16.302
If you want to see Johnnie
at his very best...

38:16.377 --> 38:19.778
just say something about chairs.
He doesn't need more than one second...

38:19.847 --> 38:21.906
to invent the most howling lie
you ever heard.

38:21.983 --> 38:24.713
I wouldn't have missed this
for anything in the world.

38:25.119 --> 38:27.519
-Beaky.
-Johnnie, how are you?

38:27.588 --> 38:30.216
-What are you doing here?
-I just popped in to see you.

38:30.291 --> 38:31.918
I'm so glad to see you.

38:32.493 --> 38:34.586
How's my little Monkeyface?

38:35.663 --> 38:37.961
-What's the matter, darling?
-Nothing. Why?

38:38.032 --> 38:39.294
You sure?

38:39.967 --> 38:43.232
Your wife seems to be missing
some chairs, old boy.

38:44.105 --> 38:46.505
Your pipe's not lit.
Let me get you a match.

38:46.574 --> 38:47.871
Thanks, old bean.

38:53.881 --> 38:56.509
-Here you are, catch.
-Thanks, old boy.

38:56.751 --> 39:00.380
About those chairs, old bean?
The missing chairs, old man.

39:00.855 --> 39:02.322
Yes, the chairs.

39:02.390 --> 39:04.790
I imagine the American came
to get them this morning.

39:04.859 --> 39:05.917
What American?

39:05.993 --> 39:09.292
Didn't I tell you about him, darling?
How stupid of me.

39:09.363 --> 39:12.799
He dropped by about a week ago.
A friend of Melbeck's.

39:13.100 --> 39:14.590
I think you were out riding.

39:15.036 --> 39:16.264
Go on, old man.

39:17.571 --> 39:20.665
Anyway, he admired the chairs.
Extravagant fellow.

39:20.741 --> 39:24.177
Offered £100 apiece for them.
Can you imagine? Anyone would take that.

39:25.246 --> 39:26.645
I wouldn't.

39:28.582 --> 39:30.607
Wouldn't you reaIly, dear?

39:31.485 --> 39:33.282
That never occurred to me.

39:34.655 --> 39:36.850
As a matter of fact, I told him you would.

39:37.425 --> 39:39.450
Why didn't you mention it?

39:39.693 --> 39:41.957
I'm sorry, darling, but I thought I did.

39:42.029 --> 39:45.123
That's all right.
If they're gone, they're gone.

39:45.232 --> 39:47.200
They're gone, all right.

39:47.501 --> 39:49.594
Shall we change for dinner?

39:50.137 --> 39:51.263
You are an angel.

39:53.240 --> 39:56.801
Hold on a minute.
You say he offered £100 apiece for them?

39:57.278 --> 39:59.576
-That's right.
-Let's have a look at the check.

39:59.647 --> 40:02.241
-He'll send it along.
-I bet you £10 to a shilling...

40:02.316 --> 40:05.717
you wouldn't dare let your wife pick up
the telephone and ask Melbeck...

40:05.786 --> 40:07.913
if he ever saw this American.

40:07.988 --> 40:10.923
Are you implying
that my husband is a liar?

40:10.991 --> 40:13.926
Don't mind Beaky, he's only joking.

40:14.361 --> 40:16.761
I prefer jokes on other subjects.

40:16.997 --> 40:19.124
Are you staying for dinner?

40:19.233 --> 40:22.430
I'm spending the weekend
unless you throw me out.

40:22.503 --> 40:27.270
Johnnie's friends are always welcome,
as long as they remain Johnnie's friends.

40:43.090 --> 40:44.887
Hello, Isobel. Good afternoon.

40:44.959 --> 40:47.120
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Admiring your display?

40:47.194 --> 40:48.183
It's nice.

40:49.330 --> 40:51.127
You are our only locaI celebrity.

40:51.532 --> 40:53.432
-Are you going my way?
-Yes, I am.

40:53.501 --> 40:55.128
-How's Johnnie?
-He's fine.

40:55.202 --> 40:58.638
I just bought your latest for him.
He's an ardent admirer of yours.

40:58.706 --> 41:01.436
I don't believe there's one of your stories
he hasn't read.

41:01.575 --> 41:04.976
-What's the matter?
-I just remembered something.

41:05.212 --> 41:07.476
Will you excuse me?
I want to make some inquiries.

41:07.548 --> 41:09.539
-Certainly.
-I'll see you for dinner soon.

41:09.617 --> 41:12.484
-Delighted.
-I'll phone you, then. Goodbye.

41:18.626 --> 41:20.253
Hello, old girl.

41:20.628 --> 41:23.688
Mr. Thwaite, I owe you an apology.

41:23.931 --> 41:25.796
Good. I mean, what for?

41:25.866 --> 41:29.768
I'll explain to you later,
but I'm afraid I've done you an injustice.

41:29.837 --> 41:34.171
An injustice? Thanks very much.
I forgive you from the bottom of my heart.

41:35.176 --> 41:36.768
You seem a bit hot under the collar.

41:36.844 --> 41:39.074
Not angry, are you? Don't answer. You are.

41:39.146 --> 41:41.944
-Must be about old Johnnie.
-Would you excuse me? I--

41:42.016 --> 41:44.985
You mustn't be angry with Johnnie.
It's a waste of time.

41:45.052 --> 41:47.987
If you want to get sore with me,
that's different aItogether.

41:48.055 --> 41:51.923
I annoy everybody, always did.
But not Johnnie. You mustn't, reaIly.

41:54.562 --> 41:57.497
Would you mind, I want to speak
to Johnnie alone. Could you--

41:57.565 --> 41:59.590
-You mean out in the garden?
-Please.

42:00.801 --> 42:03.133
Hello. Don't move. Just stay like that.

42:03.204 --> 42:05.104
I must watch the expressions
on your faces.

42:05.339 --> 42:06.772
What've you got there, old bean?

42:06.840 --> 42:09.434
You'll find out soon enough.
This is a red-letter day.

42:09.710 --> 42:12.201
-Yes, sir?
-What have we to drink in the house?

42:12.279 --> 42:14.577
Gin, brandy, champagne and Pimm's No.1 .

42:14.648 --> 42:17.173
-Bring them all, and get a move on.
-Very good, sir.

42:17.251 --> 42:19.048
Stand aside.

42:19.119 --> 42:22.486
Remember that necklace you admired
in the shop window in Regent Street?

42:22.556 --> 42:23.648
It's yours.

42:23.724 --> 42:27.319
And here.... No, that's for Ethel.
Beaky, here's a little present for you.

42:27.394 --> 42:29.157
-What is it?
-It's a secret.

42:29.230 --> 42:32.324
-Stick.
-That's the finest that money can buy.

42:32.399 --> 42:34.867
-Thanks, old bean.
-Hold those a moment, will you?

42:34.935 --> 42:36.926
Darling, do you remember this?

42:37.004 --> 42:40.838
I saw the hungry eye you gave it
last time we were up in London. It's yours.

42:40.908 --> 42:42.899
Thank you, Beaky.

42:43.210 --> 42:44.700
Here are some hats for you.

42:44.778 --> 42:47.269
Never did like your hats
from the moment I ever saw you.

42:47.348 --> 42:50.715
-Like the funny hat you wore on the train.
-I don't understand.

42:50.784 --> 42:53.582
-What made you do all this?
-Now, dear, don't be angry.

42:53.654 --> 42:56.680
If you don't like the hats,
you can always return them.

42:56.757 --> 42:59.487
I got a present for myself. Do you mind?

42:59.893 --> 43:03.693
I say, old girl, this is a nice stick. Strong.

43:07.234 --> 43:09.168
-Dog?
-That's right.

43:09.236 --> 43:11.466
-All dogs are fond of me.
-Go to Monkeyface.

43:11.538 --> 43:14.132
But, Johnnie, you haven't told us
what this is all about.

43:14.208 --> 43:16.904
-Yes, what's it mean?
-I have the pleasure of announcing...

43:16.977 --> 43:19.502
the Goodwood Cup was run today
and I backed the winner.

43:19.580 --> 43:22.310
A 10-to-1 shot, and I had £200 on it.

43:22.383 --> 43:24.749
£200 at 10-to-1, that's £2,000.

43:24.818 --> 43:26.445
-That's amazing.
-What do you mean?

43:26.520 --> 43:28.613
-The way you worked that out so quickly.
-What?

43:28.689 --> 43:32.181
-You know, the little sum.
-You're pulling my leg, old bean.

43:32.559 --> 43:34.959
Darling, what's happened to your tongue?

43:35.362 --> 43:38.957
-I suppose you disapprove of my betting.
-Not with £2,000 in her lap.

43:39.033 --> 43:41.968
Come on, smile. I know I've been naughty,
but it's all for you.

43:42.036 --> 43:44.937
-See that? That's Johnnie.
-Go on, darling, smile.

43:45.372 --> 43:47.465
Where did you get the £200?

43:47.541 --> 43:50.374
-That's not a very tactful question.
-Where did you get it?

43:50.444 --> 43:54.107
You know very well there was no
American. I got it for the chairs, of course.

43:54.348 --> 43:56.976
You sold the chairs
to gamble all your money on a horse.

43:57.051 --> 43:59.019
Not exactly.
I owed the bookies some money.

43:59.086 --> 44:01.418
It's an ancient story,
but you know how bookies are.

44:02.523 --> 44:06.960
I got the £200 to pay them off.
But then, along came this hot tip and....

44:07.161 --> 44:09.095
Darling, come on, give us a smile.

44:09.163 --> 44:10.323
Come on, old girl. I know.

44:10.397 --> 44:13.560
-You tickle her chin, and I'll make faces.
-Think that will work?

44:13.801 --> 44:16.133
Come on, smile. Come on, dear.

44:16.970 --> 44:19.370
-Do you see the glimmer of a smile?
-No, not a thing.

44:19.440 --> 44:20.668
-Know any other tricks?
-Yeah.

44:20.741 --> 44:24.108
I got something that never fails.
I make a noise like a duck.

44:26.313 --> 44:27.337
No, that's not doing it.

44:27.414 --> 44:30.178
-Shall I do this at the same time?
-Yeah, try that.

44:30.250 --> 44:31.740
Come on, dear.

44:33.320 --> 44:35.754
I forgot something. Darling, look.

44:36.223 --> 44:39.659
It's a receipt from a certain shop
for a certain pair of chairs.

44:39.727 --> 44:42.787
Paid in full,
and they deliver within the hour.

44:44.865 --> 44:47.197
-Look, she's smiling.
-I dare say she is.

44:47.401 --> 44:49.335
My darling.

44:51.071 --> 44:52.868
Well done, old bean.

44:53.974 --> 44:57.705
I say, look. Ethel's done her stuff.
What about celebrating?

44:57.978 --> 45:01.072
You can always trust Beaky to say
the right thing at the right time.

45:01.148 --> 45:02.809
Come on, old bean.

45:10.257 --> 45:12.418
I could do with a pull at the beaker.

45:12.493 --> 45:16.293
Ethel, a present for you. Turn around.

45:19.133 --> 45:20.760
Mr. Aysgarth.

45:21.602 --> 45:25.129
It's much too good for me.
You shouldn't have done that.

45:26.340 --> 45:28.570
-Thank you, sir.
-Don't mention it.

45:28.642 --> 45:30.837
What will my young man think?

45:31.044 --> 45:34.104
-Don't forget the box.
-Yes, sir.

45:34.181 --> 45:38.015
-Don't forget my hat.
-No, sir. Thank you, sir.

45:38.218 --> 45:40.516
-This is yours, old girl.
-Thank you.

45:40.587 --> 45:42.748
-This is yours, old bean.
-Thank you.

45:42.823 --> 45:44.313
Now for a toast.

45:44.391 --> 45:47.258
-What have you got there, brandy?
-Just this once.

45:47.327 --> 45:50.319
-You know that's not good for you.
-All right, old man.

45:50.898 --> 45:53.696
-Maybe just this once.
-All right, old bean.

45:54.401 --> 45:58.303
I drink to the last bet
that will ever made by Johnnie Aysgarth.

45:58.372 --> 46:00.306
Last bet, old bean.

46:21.695 --> 46:25.324
-Get some water, quick.
-It won't help. I've seen it happen before.

46:25.399 --> 46:29.199
There's nothing much you can do about it.
That's no use, darling.

46:29.269 --> 46:32.670
It will either kill him
or it will go away by itself.

46:45.752 --> 46:47.379
Sorry, old bean.

46:50.724 --> 46:53.249
One of these days, it will kill him.

47:00.501 --> 47:03.061
-Hello, Mrs. Aysgarth.
-How are you, Mrs. Newsham?

47:03.136 --> 47:06.469
-What a lot of books.
-Do you reaIly read them all, my dear?

47:06.540 --> 47:10.840
-I'm afraid not. They're for Johnnie.
-Since when has he....

47:12.312 --> 47:15.042
-Detective stories.
-Yes, he adores them.

47:15.249 --> 47:18.241
So Johnnie's settled down
to the simple ruraI life.

47:18.318 --> 47:22.379
-And it seems to agree with him.
-Abandoned all his vices, has he?

47:22.756 --> 47:24.917
Vices? What vices, Mrs. Newsham?

47:25.325 --> 47:28.226
Such as betting at the races, for instance.

47:28.395 --> 47:31.057
He has no time for that.
He's much too busy with his job.

47:31.131 --> 47:34.931
Is he? Then he must have taken
an afternoon off last Tuesday.

47:35.168 --> 47:37.466
He was at the Merchester Races.

47:38.005 --> 47:40.997
Was he? How interesting. Good afternoon.

47:41.909 --> 47:43.171
Goodbye.

48:00.494 --> 48:03.725
-Good afternoon, Mrs. Aysgarth.
-Good afternoon. Is Mr. Aysgarth in?

48:03.797 --> 48:05.662
Why, no.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.468
-When do you expect him?
-I reaIly couldn't say.

48:09.536 --> 48:12.027
Perhaps you'd like to talk
to Captain Melbeck.

48:12.105 --> 48:14.403
Yes, I would very much, please.

48:16.476 --> 48:18.000
Mrs. Aysgarth to see you.

48:19.012 --> 48:20.206
Come in.

48:22.049 --> 48:24.882
-What a pleasure to see you.
-Good afternoon.

48:25.352 --> 48:27.377
-Do sit down.
-Thank you.

48:30.223 --> 48:32.919
I don't want to impose upon you...

48:32.993 --> 48:36.554
but you're Johnnie's cousin
as well as his employer.

48:37.230 --> 48:40.757
I wanted to talk to you about him.
I'm terribly worried.

48:41.068 --> 48:43.229
Yes, I can understand that.

48:44.404 --> 48:48.363
On the other hand, I told him
I wouldn't prosecute. Of course--

48:48.442 --> 48:51.900
-I don't understand.
-I told him I wouldn't prosecute.

48:54.247 --> 48:56.681
What on earth are you talking about?

48:56.750 --> 48:58.809
How does he get away with it?

48:58.885 --> 49:01.615
What reason did he give you
when I discharged him?

49:01.688 --> 49:05.283
-When did you discharge him?
-Six weeks ago.

49:06.960 --> 49:09.793
I haven't a very keen sense of humor.

49:10.697 --> 49:13.666
If this is a joke, I wish you would tell me.

49:14.001 --> 49:16.128
It's not funny to me.

49:16.770 --> 49:19.432
We had an unexpected audit
six weeks ago.

49:19.506 --> 49:22.236
The accounts showed a deficit of £2,000.

49:22.943 --> 49:25.844
And when I looked into
Johnnie's records....

49:26.446 --> 49:28.175
I'm terribly sorry.

49:28.582 --> 49:30.550
He should have told you.

49:30.684 --> 49:32.675
It's perfectly all right.

49:32.753 --> 49:35.586
And you say
you aren't going to prosecute?

49:36.423 --> 49:38.254
Not for the time being.

49:38.325 --> 49:42.284
I'll give him every possible opportunity
of replacing the money, but...

49:43.563 --> 49:45.190
after all....

49:47.000 --> 49:49.969
Yes, of course. Thank you very much.

49:55.876 --> 49:57.138
Goodbye.

50:01.348 --> 50:04.078
-Good afternoon, madam.
-Mr. Aysgarth home yet?

50:04.151 --> 50:05.482
No, madam.

51:31.671 --> 51:34.265
-Then you've heard.
-Yes, I've heard.

51:37.878 --> 51:40.312
I'm so sorry, darling. I'm terribly sorry.

51:41.948 --> 51:46.009
This telegram just came from the doctor.
It tells how it happened.

52:08.041 --> 52:10.601
And to my dear sister, Emily Scudamore...

52:10.677 --> 52:15.171
I bequeath an annuity of £1,000
for the duration of her lifetime.

52:16.149 --> 52:20.176
To my niece, Miss EIsie Chilling,
the sum of £5,000.

52:21.288 --> 52:25.816
To my two dear cousins,
Robert and Jane Atwood, £500 each.

52:26.760 --> 52:31.390
The residue of my estate, my house,
and all the property contained therein...

52:31.464 --> 52:33.989
I leave to my beloved wife, Martha...

52:34.067 --> 52:38.629
with the wish that she continue
the present aIlowance of £500 a year...

52:38.705 --> 52:40.798
to my daughter, Lina.

52:42.742 --> 52:46.405
AIso, to my daughter Lina
and her husband John Aysgarth...

52:46.847 --> 52:49.372
I bequeath the portrait of myself...

52:49.449 --> 52:52.714
painted by the distinguished
Sir Joshua Nettlewood.

53:01.261 --> 53:03.627
-I could do with a drink.
-I'll get you one.

53:03.697 --> 53:06.860
Don't bother, I'll get it myself.
In the study, isn't it?

53:30.023 --> 53:31.650
You win, old boy.

53:46.673 --> 53:48.004
Yes, dear?

53:49.042 --> 53:52.205
Do you ever have any regrets
that you married me?

53:52.846 --> 53:54.643
Why do you ask that?

53:55.248 --> 53:56.613
It seems pretty obvious...

53:56.683 --> 53:59.277
that your father would've left you
more than his portrait...

53:59.352 --> 54:01.650
if you'd been anybody else
but Mrs. John Aysgarth.

54:01.721 --> 54:03.746
So that's what you meant.

54:03.924 --> 54:06.324
You haven't answered my question.

54:06.760 --> 54:09.354
What about you? Have you any regrets?

54:10.897 --> 54:15.459
Monkeyface, marrying you is the one thing
I've never changed my mind about.

54:16.202 --> 54:19.467
-Do you reaIly mean that?
-Yes, I reaIly mean that.

54:20.240 --> 54:23.300
I want nothing
but to spend the rest of my life with you.

54:23.376 --> 54:25.901
And if you were to die first, I....

54:26.146 --> 54:28.046
If I were to die first?

54:30.717 --> 54:32.651
Listen, what about you?

54:33.420 --> 54:36.048
I couldn't stop loving you if I tried.

54:37.991 --> 54:39.515
Have you tried?

54:40.994 --> 54:43.053
Yes. Once.

54:45.098 --> 54:46.292
When?

54:47.901 --> 54:51.530
When I found out you'd lost your job
with Captain Melbeck.

54:55.208 --> 54:58.143
-How long have you known?
-Since last Friday.

54:58.979 --> 55:02.039
-Who told you?
-Captain Melbeck. I met him.

55:04.617 --> 55:07.609
-Did he tell you why?
-No.

55:10.023 --> 55:12.014
Suppose you tell me why.

55:12.325 --> 55:14.316
We just didn't get along.

55:15.362 --> 55:18.627
Quite nice here.
Shall we stop and look at the sea?

55:27.007 --> 55:29.441
Why didn't you get along with him?

55:29.576 --> 55:32.306
I don't know. He's a bit of an old fogy.

55:32.379 --> 55:35.212
I suppose my ideas
were too daring for him.

55:35.281 --> 55:39.980
I've always had the notion that
the secret of success is to start at the top.

55:42.155 --> 55:45.386
You think I'm talking through my hat,
don't you? I'm not.

55:45.458 --> 55:48.518
The way to make money
is to think in a big way.

55:50.096 --> 55:53.361
Look at this all land, for instance.
Look at the view.

55:53.433 --> 55:55.901
Why isn't something done about it?

55:56.136 --> 55:59.799
If I had £10,000, or better still, £20,000...

56:00.106 --> 56:02.574
I could start a development here.

56:07.180 --> 56:09.444
All you need is £20,000?

56:11.684 --> 56:13.117
Or £30,000.

56:14.220 --> 56:16.745
An extra £10,000 wouldn't hurt a bit.

56:17.657 --> 56:19.955
Beaky, this is the ground plan.

56:20.026 --> 56:22.927
Wonderful. We could put
the large hotel there.

56:22.996 --> 56:25.897
That's the idea. And down here,
we could build the beach huts.

56:25.965 --> 56:28.058
-Beechnuts, old bean?
-Huts, Beaky.

56:28.735 --> 56:33.172
-Hello. What goes on here, anyway?
-We're organizing a reaI estate company.

56:33.239 --> 56:36.174
We're about to buy
a very beautiful piece of land by the sea.

56:36.242 --> 56:38.608
What a view, what sun, what air.

56:38.945 --> 56:41.140
Then we're going to sell part of it
at a profit.

56:41.214 --> 56:44.149
-Yes, but it will need financing, won't it?
-Of course.

56:44.217 --> 56:45.912
You found somebody
to put up the money?

56:45.985 --> 56:47.316
Of course.

56:47.387 --> 56:49.082
-Who?
-Me.

56:52.358 --> 56:53.552
I see.

56:54.327 --> 56:57.194
The idea is mine,
but the money is Beaky's.

56:57.464 --> 57:01.161
And the corporation, Beaky borrows
against those securities he has in Paris.

57:01.234 --> 57:04.499
Then we issue stock, and....
Let me show you, dear.

57:06.506 --> 57:09.100
The company's going to be in my name.

57:09.275 --> 57:11.675
-Yes, but....
-Look, darling...

57:12.612 --> 57:15.046
let me show you how simple it is.

57:16.649 --> 57:19.243
-Does Beaky understand it?
-Perfectly.

57:19.919 --> 57:21.216
I think.

57:22.288 --> 57:27.123
I beg your pardon, sir. Captain Melbeck
would like to talk to you on the telephone.

57:29.129 --> 57:31.120
Thank you. I'll take it in the study.

57:31.197 --> 57:33.392
-Excuse me, Beaky.
-All right, old bean.

57:35.902 --> 57:38.336
Please explain it to me, will you?

57:38.404 --> 57:40.099
You see, my dear girl....

57:40.173 --> 57:44.200
I say, I rather like this feeling
of big business and all that sort of thing.

57:44.677 --> 57:47.168
George, I keep telling you
not to worry about it.

57:47.247 --> 57:50.876
I've got something on now.
I can pay you back in a couple of weeks.

57:51.251 --> 57:54.379
We buy up this land
and then we sell part of it.

57:54.454 --> 57:56.979
That gives us a 100% profit in no time.

57:57.056 --> 58:00.082
On the other part,
we build something or other.

58:00.160 --> 58:03.288
But from whom do you buy the land?
How much do you pay for it?

58:03.363 --> 58:06.799
-To whom do you sell it?
-That shouldn't be difficult.

58:07.667 --> 58:09.999
Isn't it about time you grew up?

58:10.170 --> 58:12.968
-You're scolding me.
-You need a scolding.

58:13.273 --> 58:14.672
-Do I?
-Yes, you do.

58:14.741 --> 58:17.232
Shall I go and stand in the corner?

58:20.213 --> 58:23.671
-You're not being fair to Johnnie.
-That's a bit thick.

58:23.883 --> 58:26.215
Why, he's president
of the whole baIly thingamajig.

58:26.286 --> 58:29.778
-Gets a salary, writes his own checks.
-Yes, that's what I mean.

58:29.856 --> 58:31.756
What's wrong with that?

58:32.458 --> 58:36.622
OId bean, Lina's been telling me
you're a bit soft in the head. Is that it?

58:36.696 --> 58:40.291
-It sounded like that.
-Come now, that's not very wifely.

58:40.633 --> 58:43.761
Hadn't you better change for dinner?
It's getting late.

58:43.836 --> 58:46.270
Darling, Beaky's staying with us
for a few days.

58:46.339 --> 58:49.137
-You know your room.
-I shan't be a jiffy.

58:54.047 --> 58:57.710
Look here. What right have you
to interfere in my affairs?

58:58.384 --> 59:01.717
I wasn't reaIly. I was only....

59:02.622 --> 59:04.351
You were only what?

59:04.424 --> 59:08.019
I was only trying to tell Beaky
that he shouldn't leave everything to you...

59:08.094 --> 59:11.825
because if something went wrong,
he should take a little responsibility, too.

59:12.065 --> 59:15.364
It's not as if you're both
experienced businessmen.

59:15.935 --> 59:19.894
-What do you know about business?
-Very little. I was only--

59:19.973 --> 59:21.736
Suppose Beaky had taken you seriously?

59:21.808 --> 59:24.208
You'd have ruined the whole scheme,
you realize that?

59:24.277 --> 59:28.179
-But if it weren't any good....
-That's my business, not yours.

59:29.382 --> 59:31.612
If I say it's good, it's good.

59:32.151 --> 59:33.641
I'm going through with this deaI.

59:33.720 --> 59:36.245
I don't want any interference
from you or anyone else.

59:36.322 --> 59:38.790
-Is that clear?
-Yes, that's clear.

59:50.866 --> 59:52.527
Hello, Monkeyface.

59:52.968 --> 59:55.835
You frightened me.
I didn't see you coming.

59:58.207 --> 01:00:01.608
I thought you might like to know
I'm caIling off the reaI estate plan.

01:00:01.677 --> 01:00:03.042
Why? What happened?

01:00:03.112 --> 01:00:05.945
-Nothing.
-Does Beaky know about this?

01:00:06.348 --> 01:00:08.839
-No, not yet.
-Why are you doing it?

01:00:09.518 --> 01:00:12.954
I don't know. Perhaps the land
isn't any good. Who knows?

01:00:13.022 --> 01:00:16.549
Or perhaps I don't like the idea
of risking Beaky's money.

01:00:16.625 --> 01:00:19.617
Or perhaps it's a stiff job and I'm too lazy.

01:00:20.996 --> 01:00:24.625
-Are you still angry about last night?
-No, I'm not angry.

01:00:25.034 --> 01:00:28.231
Are you sure?
Because I couldn't sleep all night.

01:00:28.404 --> 01:00:31.669
You'd never spoken so sharply
to me before, and I was afraid....

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:33.298
Afraid of what?

01:00:33.909 --> 01:00:36.537
I was afraid you'd stopped loving me.

01:00:36.979 --> 01:00:39.209
No, Monkeyface, I'm not angry.

01:00:39.648 --> 01:00:41.673
And I love you very much.

01:00:54.496 --> 01:00:58.023
Every time I play anagrams,
I can only make three-letter words.

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:00.330
D-O-U-B. There's no such word.

01:01:01.003 --> 01:01:04.336
D-O-U-B-T. ''Doubt.'' F-U-L. ''Doubtful.''

01:01:04.406 --> 01:01:06.203
Take that, old girl.

01:01:06.275 --> 01:01:08.743
PersonaIly, I don't see
what's wrong with this scheme.

01:01:08.811 --> 01:01:11.905
But if you say there's no good
going ahead, don't let's go ahead.

01:01:11.981 --> 01:01:13.608
Do I get another turn?

01:01:13.682 --> 01:01:18.085
I still don't understand why we have to go
all the way out there to look at it.

01:01:18.153 --> 01:01:21.452
I won't be responsible
for caIling the scheme off...

01:01:21.624 --> 01:01:26.186
-without first proving to you it's no good.
-If you say it's no good, that satisfies me.

01:01:26.261 --> 01:01:29.059
After all, you discovered the land.
It was your idea.

01:01:29.131 --> 01:01:32.794
If a fellow has an idea,
he jolly well ought to follow it up.

01:01:32.868 --> 01:01:36.031
You have to go up there
early tomorrow morning and take a look.

01:01:36.105 --> 01:01:38.096
Why are you so insistent?

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:41.102
Because, as I told you,
I won't be responsible.

01:01:41.176 --> 01:01:45.203
That's a long one. ''Mudder.''
There's no such word.

01:01:45.514 --> 01:01:46.811
Try the ''R.''

01:01:46.882 --> 01:01:51.046
I don't want to go up there in the morning.
Besides, it'll be nasty, and cold, and wet.

01:01:51.353 --> 01:01:53.617
-Now, Beaky.
-What time do we have to start?

01:01:54.823 --> 01:01:57.951
If I had an ''e'' and an ''r''
I could make that murderer.

01:01:58.894 --> 01:02:00.293
The earlier the better.

01:02:00.362 --> 01:02:03.490
I'd say about 7:00.
There won't be so much traffic then.

01:02:03.565 --> 01:02:07.160
-7:00? That's a bit pig's tail.
-Pig's tail?

01:02:07.236 --> 01:02:11.297
Too early.
Did you never hear that one, pig's tail?

01:03:10.532 --> 01:03:12.056
Is Mr. Aysgarth having breakfast?

01:03:12.134 --> 01:03:15.160
No, ma'am, he wouldn't wait.
He said he'd have some on the road.

01:03:15.237 --> 01:03:16.932
He left two hours ago with Mr. Thwaite.

01:03:17.005 --> 01:03:19.235
-What car did they use?
-Mr. Thwaite's, I believe.

01:05:59.334 --> 01:06:02.132
This ought to do it. Put in the plug now.

01:06:04.039 --> 01:06:05.870
How's that, old bean?

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.880
-Hello, old girl.
-Hello, darling.

01:06:28.297 --> 01:06:31.289
What's all this?
I've only been away a few hours.

01:06:31.366 --> 01:06:34.802
-It seemed like a thousand years.
-Seems like that to me, too.

01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:36.360
Shut up, Beaky. It was nothing.

01:06:36.438 --> 01:06:40.602
Nothing? I came very close
to losing my life. You call that nothing?

01:06:41.009 --> 01:06:44.274
-You nearly lost your life?
-Came very close to it.

01:06:45.614 --> 01:06:48.981
-Let's drop the subject.
-No, Beaky, go on. I want to hear.

01:06:49.785 --> 01:06:53.243
There we were at the top of the cliff.
I agreed that Johnnie was right.

01:06:53.322 --> 01:06:55.153
There was too much chalk in the soil.

01:06:55.223 --> 01:07:00.126
I was trying to turn my car near the edge
of the cliff. I never was handy with a car.

01:07:00.195 --> 01:07:01.662
-Was Johnnie in the car?
-No.

01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:03.891
He was a few feet away
looking over at the view.

01:07:03.966 --> 01:07:06.799
It's hardly worth talking about.
Let's all have a drink.

01:07:06.868 --> 01:07:09.496
I didn't realize I was backing the car
towards the edge.

01:07:09.571 --> 01:07:11.436
But I was, by Jove. Right up to it.

01:07:11.506 --> 01:07:14.441
If Johnnie hadn't taken a flying leap
and grabbed the brake...

01:07:14.509 --> 01:07:16.977
I should be in kingdom come by now.

01:07:17.412 --> 01:07:20.074
-Johnnie saved your life?
-He certainly did.

01:07:20.148 --> 01:07:22.878
Came jolly close to losing his own, too.

01:07:23.151 --> 01:07:26.177
I can never tell you
how much this means to me.

01:07:26.254 --> 01:07:29.121
-To you, darling?
-It means a good bit to me, too.

01:07:29.191 --> 01:07:32.786
The old fellow deserves a reward.
How about a night out?

01:07:33.462 --> 01:07:35.123
A spot of celebrating on me.

01:07:35.197 --> 01:07:37.529
That's kind of you,
but don't you have to go to Paris?

01:07:37.599 --> 01:07:40.591
-Paris?
-Yes. My securities are over there.

01:07:40.669 --> 01:07:43.866
I've got to go over there
and cancel all the arrangements for them.

01:07:44.272 --> 01:07:46.365
Why don't you come over with me?

01:07:46.441 --> 01:07:48.966
The cad seems to forget
I'm a married man.

01:07:49.044 --> 01:07:50.477
I'll tell you what I might do.

01:07:50.545 --> 01:07:53.514
I might drive up as far as London with you
for that evening out.

01:07:53.582 --> 01:07:56.676
-How about that, Monkeyface?
-Yes, Monkey.... Lina. Do let him come.

01:07:56.752 --> 01:07:58.515
It seems to me that--

01:07:58.587 --> 01:08:01.283
Yes, I know. It seems to you
I should be looking for a job.

01:08:01.356 --> 01:08:04.655
It seems to me I'd have much more chance
of getting a job in London.

01:08:04.726 --> 01:08:07.024
Yes, of course he would.
Do let him come, Lina.

01:08:07.095 --> 01:08:09.689
I don't see very well how I can stop him.

01:08:09.765 --> 01:08:11.357
Great.

01:08:11.433 --> 01:08:13.867
Pity that he won't come to Paris with me.

01:08:13.935 --> 01:08:16.926
Did I ever tell you what happened to me
last time I was in Paris?

01:08:17.005 --> 01:08:20.031
A very curious instance.
I was walking down the Champs Élysées...

01:08:20.108 --> 01:08:22.736
and I met the most charming girl.

01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:26.474
Took her out and gave her a spot
of dinner. And it wasn't till much later....

01:08:27.783 --> 01:08:30.183
Sorry, old bean. Sorry, old girl.

01:08:32.921 --> 01:08:35.651
Nearly put the foot in it again, have I?

01:08:53.908 --> 01:08:56.173
There's an Inspector Hodgson
in the hall, ma'am.

01:08:56.243 --> 01:08:57.768
He wanted to see Mr. Aysgarth.

01:08:57.845 --> 01:09:01.509
But when I said he was away,
he asked if he might speak to you.

01:09:04.519 --> 01:09:06.919
Show him to the study,
will you, Ethel, please.

01:09:06.988 --> 01:09:08.649
Very good, madam.

01:09:16.031 --> 01:09:19.158
-Will you come this way, please, sir?
-Thank you.

01:09:28.609 --> 01:09:30.908
-Mrs. Aysgarth?
-Yes.

01:09:30.979 --> 01:09:34.971
My name's Hodgson. Inspector Hodgson.
We're from the county police.

01:09:35.050 --> 01:09:37.109
This is my colleague. Mr. Benson.

01:09:37.185 --> 01:09:39.085
-How do you do, Mr. Benson?
-How do you do?

01:09:39.154 --> 01:09:41.452
-Won't you sit down?
-Thank you, ma'am.

01:09:41.723 --> 01:09:44.214
I understand your husband's not in.

01:09:44.426 --> 01:09:46.621
No. He's been up in London for two days.

01:09:46.694 --> 01:09:49.926
As he's not here,
I thought you might be able to help us.

01:09:49.997 --> 01:09:52.899
Yes, of course.
Won't you have some tea or something?

01:09:52.968 --> 01:09:55.232
No, thank you. We've had ours.

01:09:55.570 --> 01:09:57.970
I believe you know a Mr. Thwaite.

01:09:58.106 --> 01:10:00.404
Yes, he's a close friend of my husband.

01:10:00.475 --> 01:10:02.807
I don't know how to put it, quite.

01:10:03.478 --> 01:10:06.208
Perhaps it would be easier
if I showed you this.

01:10:06.281 --> 01:10:07.942
This afternoon's paper.

01:10:10.519 --> 01:10:11.986
Excuse me.

01:10:49.591 --> 01:10:53.186
I'm sorry. This is a shock.

01:10:55.163 --> 01:10:57.324
We knew him so very well.

01:10:57.399 --> 01:11:00.095
Sorry to have to do this, ma'am...

01:11:00.168 --> 01:11:03.763
but we're making inquiries
on behaIf of the Paris police.

01:11:03.838 --> 01:11:06.136
They found papers
on Mr. Thwaite's person...

01:11:06.208 --> 01:11:09.666
which indicated he'd just formed
a corporation with your husband.

01:11:14.115 --> 01:11:17.414
What do the French police believe
caused the death?

01:11:17.819 --> 01:11:21.346
This is the copy of a telegram
we received from Paris.

01:11:29.965 --> 01:11:33.765
''Thwaite visited the place
in the company of another Englishman.

01:11:33.835 --> 01:11:36.429
''Both men had evidently been drinking.

01:11:36.504 --> 01:11:39.701
''On arrivaI, Thwaite ordered
a bottle of brandy.

01:11:39.774 --> 01:11:43.642
''According to the statement
of one of the waiters there...

01:11:43.712 --> 01:11:48.115
''Thwaite's companion asked for
the brandy to be served in large beakers.

01:11:48.416 --> 01:11:51.817
''Apparently, as a result of a bet
between the two men...

01:11:51.886 --> 01:11:55.947
''Thwaite filled one of these beakers
to the brim and drank it all.

01:11:56.258 --> 01:11:59.455
''The other man was not present
when the actuaI tragedy happened...

01:11:59.527 --> 01:12:02.360
''having left the place
a few minutes before.

01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:06.298
''French police have not yet succeeded
in establishing his identity.

01:12:06.601 --> 01:12:10.367
''According to the waiter, who has
a slight understanding of English...

01:12:10.438 --> 01:12:15.137
''his name would appear to be
'Awlbeam' or 'Holebeam.'''

01:12:18.647 --> 01:12:20.911
I'm sorry to upset you, ma'am.

01:12:21.483 --> 01:12:24.748
But do you or your husband
know of any friend of Mr. Thwaite's...

01:12:24.819 --> 01:12:26.980
who would answer to such a name?

01:12:27.822 --> 01:12:31.815
Perhaps Mrs. Aysgarth could enlighten us
about this corporation.

01:12:32.427 --> 01:12:34.418
Yes, I believe I can.

01:12:35.063 --> 01:12:38.555
My husband had planned
a reaI estate development with him.

01:12:39.134 --> 01:12:42.797
Mr. Thwaite had gone to Paris
to dissolve the corporation.

01:12:43.171 --> 01:12:46.106
He apparently died before he could do this.

01:12:46.641 --> 01:12:49.576
Thank you, ma'am.
Any further questions, Benson?

01:12:49.644 --> 01:12:51.271
None that I can think of.

01:12:51.346 --> 01:12:54.179
-Thank you very much, Mrs. Aysgarth.
-Thank you.

01:13:03.191 --> 01:13:04.556
I'm sorry.

01:13:13.134 --> 01:13:15.398
When does Mr. Aysgarth
return from London?

01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:16.960
I expect him this evening.

01:13:17.038 --> 01:13:19.199
Would you ask him
to ring me at the station?

01:13:19.274 --> 01:13:21.799
Yes, of course.
Goodbye, Inspector Hodgson.

01:13:21.876 --> 01:13:23.173
Goodbye.

01:13:23.645 --> 01:13:26.136
-Benson.
-Goodbye, Mrs. Aysgarth.

01:14:06.621 --> 01:14:08.521
He didn't go to Paris.

01:14:08.923 --> 01:14:11.391
He didn't go to Paris, I tell you.

01:14:20.735 --> 01:14:21.929
Hogarth Club.

01:14:22.003 --> 01:14:24.528
May I speak to Mr. Aysgarth, please?

01:14:24.973 --> 01:14:26.907
When do you expect him?

01:14:28.543 --> 01:14:30.602
He left yesterday morning?

01:14:31.813 --> 01:14:34.247
No. It doesn't matter. Thank you.

01:14:58.606 --> 01:15:00.233
Hello, Monkeyface.

01:15:12.654 --> 01:15:15.122
You've read about Beaky, have you?

01:15:16.891 --> 01:15:19.121
I was terribly fond of Beaky.

01:15:19.794 --> 01:15:22.661
-Were you?
-Yes, dear.

01:15:23.164 --> 01:15:26.224
I loved that silly, generous,
good-hearted fool.

01:15:26.568 --> 01:15:29.560
-Did you?
-Of course I did.

01:15:30.405 --> 01:15:33.499
Next to you, I loved him
more than anybody in the world.

01:15:33.575 --> 01:15:35.406
Next to me?

01:15:37.111 --> 01:15:38.976
Poor Monkeyface.

01:15:40.482 --> 01:15:44.248
Here I am thinking only of myself
and forgetting all about you.

01:15:44.319 --> 01:15:46.651
You liked him, too, didn't you?

01:15:47.489 --> 01:15:49.787
I liked him very much.

01:15:52.894 --> 01:15:54.725
The police were here.

01:15:57.198 --> 01:15:58.495
What did they want?

01:15:59.467 --> 01:16:01.697
They wanted you to help them.

01:16:01.936 --> 01:16:03.904
They had a telegram from Paris...

01:16:03.972 --> 01:16:07.635
and it seems there was
an Englishman who made a bet--

01:16:07.709 --> 01:16:11.110
Yes, I know.
The whole story was in the late edition.

01:16:11.412 --> 01:16:12.709
What else?

01:16:13.181 --> 01:16:15.809
The inspector wants you to phone him.

01:16:16.150 --> 01:16:19.881
He thought perhaps you could
help identify this Englishman.

01:16:27.562 --> 01:16:31.123
What did you tell them?
Did you mention the corporation?

01:16:31.332 --> 01:16:32.663
NaturaIly.

01:16:32.967 --> 01:16:36.266
I told them that Beaky
was planning to dissolve it.

01:16:36.804 --> 01:16:40.672
I wish you'd left all that to me.
What else did you tell them?

01:16:41.042 --> 01:16:42.441
That's about all.

01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:46.173
I said I was expecting you
back from London at any moment.

01:16:57.659 --> 01:17:00.992
Hello. Wickstead police station, please.

01:17:04.299 --> 01:17:06.199
Hello, Inspector.

01:17:06.534 --> 01:17:09.298
This is John Aysgarth. I've just got home.

01:17:10.038 --> 01:17:11.130
Yes.

01:17:11.506 --> 01:17:13.997
I drove up to London with him
on Tuesday evening.

01:17:14.075 --> 01:17:15.702
We dined at the Savoy.

01:17:15.777 --> 01:17:16.835
No.

01:17:16.911 --> 01:17:17.969
Yes.

01:17:18.046 --> 01:17:20.207
Then I saw him off at Croyden Airport.

01:17:20.281 --> 01:17:21.373
Yes.

01:17:22.183 --> 01:17:25.152
No. I stayed in London until this afternoon.

01:17:25.987 --> 01:17:26.976
At my club.

01:17:28.089 --> 01:17:29.147
Yes.

01:17:30.792 --> 01:17:31.850
Yes.

01:17:34.095 --> 01:17:35.528
Not at all, Inspector.

01:17:35.597 --> 01:17:38.464
If I can help you in any other way,
be sure to let me know.

01:17:59.954 --> 01:18:01.785
Isobel, may I come in?

01:18:01.856 --> 01:18:04.381
Lina, how nice.
I was thinking only yesterday...

01:18:04.459 --> 01:18:06.586
that I don't see haIf as much of you
as I'd like.

01:18:06.661 --> 01:18:07.992
How sweet of you.

01:18:08.096 --> 01:18:10.724
I couldn't put my light out
until 3:00 this morning.

01:18:10.798 --> 01:18:14.962
I was so interested in your last book that I
had to come over and talk to you about it.

01:18:15.036 --> 01:18:18.699
That's the most thrilling compliment
I ever got. Come and sit down.

01:18:19.741 --> 01:18:21.766
-Had your tea?
-Yes, I have. Thank you.

01:18:21.843 --> 01:18:24.277
I never knew you were
such a murder story fan.

01:18:24.345 --> 01:18:26.245
Neither did I until recently.

01:18:26.314 --> 01:18:28.874
-Did you reaIly like it?
-I couldn't put it down.

01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:31.441
I was completely fascinated
by the way your villain--

01:18:31.519 --> 01:18:33.714
My villain? My hero, you mean.

01:18:33.788 --> 01:18:36.154
I always think of my murderers
as my heroes.

01:18:36.224 --> 01:18:39.785
I didn't mean to interrupt. You were
saying you were completely fascinated.

01:18:39.861 --> 01:18:43.160
When he enticed his victim
across the footbridge...

01:18:43.231 --> 01:18:45.529
knowing that the bridge
had been sawn through--

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:49.001
He aIso knew that his victim
couldn't swim. Don't forget that.

01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:53.668
What I want to know is this.
Would you call that an actuaI murder?

01:18:53.741 --> 01:18:57.074
From a moraI standpoint,
there's no question at all.

01:18:57.145 --> 01:18:58.510
It is murder.

01:18:58.813 --> 01:19:00.280
I suppose it is.

01:19:00.348 --> 01:19:01.781
What does Johnnie think?

01:19:01.849 --> 01:19:04.317
Johnnie?
I haven't discussed it with him yet.

01:19:04.385 --> 01:19:06.148
I should think he'd be interested.

01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:09.155
The same situation
with this friend of his in Paris.

01:19:10.024 --> 01:19:11.116
The same?

01:19:11.192 --> 01:19:13.285
That brandy business
is just like my footbridge.

01:19:13.361 --> 01:19:15.556
If they get his companion,
the question would be:

01:19:15.630 --> 01:19:17.257
Was it murder or an accident?

01:19:17.331 --> 01:19:19.799
The brandy thing isn't new at all,
you know.

01:19:20.635 --> 01:19:23.798
-It's been done before?
-Yes, and in reaI life, too.

01:19:23.871 --> 01:19:24.963
I have it here.

01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:28.268
Richard Palmer got rid of
one of his victims that way.

01:19:28.342 --> 01:19:30.071
A man caIled Abbey.

01:19:30.144 --> 01:19:31.338
Was he hanged?

01:19:31.412 --> 01:19:35.872
<i>Trial of Richard Palmer.</i> Where can it be?

01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:39.213
They got him eventuaIly,
after he killed haIf a dozen other people.

01:19:39.287 --> 01:19:42.620
The fool got bored with the brandy
method and went on with reaI poison.

01:19:42.690 --> 01:19:45.523
-He was a fool, wasn't he?
-Maybe I put it under the ''T's.''

01:19:45.593 --> 01:19:49.586
If he'd stuck to brandy, he might have....
That's an interesting idea.

01:19:49.664 --> 01:19:51.757
Suppose I ask my brother about it.

01:19:51.833 --> 01:19:55.667
He's the Home Office Analyst. Conducts
post-mortems and all that sort of things.

01:19:55.737 --> 01:19:57.500
I get some of my neatest ideas from him.

01:19:57.572 --> 01:20:01.565
It reaIly doesn't matter, Isobel.
Please don't bother. It's not important.

01:20:02.243 --> 01:20:04.734
I'll run along. I don't want to trouble you.

01:20:04.812 --> 01:20:08.748
-Now I remember. It's in your own house.
-What is?

01:20:08.816 --> 01:20:11.717
<i>The Trial of Richard Palmer.</i>
That book about the brandy.

01:20:11.786 --> 01:20:14.619
Johnnie borrowed it
a couple of weeks ago.

01:20:16.023 --> 01:20:18.514
-Goodbye, Isobel.
-Goodbye, my dear.

01:21:30.731 --> 01:21:32.096
Hello?

01:21:32.934 --> 01:21:35.425
No, he isn't in.
This is Mrs. Aysgarth speaking.

01:21:35.503 --> 01:21:37.368
This is
the Guarantors Assurance Company.

01:21:37.438 --> 01:21:41.340
Would you tell Mr. Aysgarth that there's
been a delay in replying to his inquiry?

01:21:41.409 --> 01:21:45.175
We have written him fully on the matter.
He should get our letter in the morning.

01:21:45.479 --> 01:21:47.413
Yes, I will. Thank you.

01:22:11.305 --> 01:22:14.832
-Good morning, madam.
-Good morning. Are there any letters?

01:22:14.909 --> 01:22:18.572
Just three for Mr. Aysgarth
and a magazine for you, ma'am.

01:22:34.228 --> 01:22:36.219
Hello, Ethel. You here again?

01:22:36.297 --> 01:22:39.198
Yes, sir. I've brought
your morning tea and the post.

01:22:39.267 --> 01:22:43.431
-Hello, darling. Any letters for me?
-Three.

01:22:49.377 --> 01:22:50.969
Thank you, dear.

01:23:36.490 --> 01:23:39.391
-Well, well, well.
-Good news?

01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:42.795
Got a letter from old Spotty.
He's going to India.

01:23:44.565 --> 01:23:46.157
What a life.

01:23:46.567 --> 01:23:49.400
Says he wishes he had time
to pop down and see us.

01:23:50.438 --> 01:23:53.805
That'd be a dream. Poor old Spotty.

01:23:56.577 --> 01:23:59.842
-Do you mind if I take my bath before you?
-No, dear.

01:24:13.594 --> 01:24:17.462
May I have some more soap,
Monkeyface? This bit's nearly gone.

01:24:18.432 --> 01:24:21.458
Yes, there's some in the cupboard
above the washbasin.

01:24:44.859 --> 01:24:48.795
-Darling, you're not shivering, are you?
-I've a bit of a chill.

01:24:49.063 --> 01:24:51.998
Cold in all this sunshine?
Let me warm you up.

01:24:52.666 --> 01:24:55.760
My poor little shivering baby.
How do you feel now? Better?

01:24:55.836 --> 01:24:58.828
-Much.
-Good. Perhaps this will help.

01:25:03.577 --> 01:25:07.775
-Darling, what are we doing tonight?
-We're going to Isobel's to dine.

01:25:08.249 --> 01:25:09.443
What a bore.

01:25:22.396 --> 01:25:24.762
Issie, let's get back
to that new book of yours.

01:25:24.832 --> 01:25:29.599
The fellow comes into the room, locks it,
and starts to strum on the piano...

01:25:29.670 --> 01:25:32.662
then somebody shoots him
through the locked door? That the idea?

01:25:33.541 --> 01:25:37.272
That doesn't make sense. Why would he
lock the door just to play the piano?

01:25:37.344 --> 01:25:38.834
Was he ashamed of his playing?

01:25:38.913 --> 01:25:40.437
I arranged it this way.

01:25:40.514 --> 01:25:44.473
A certain note on the piano was wired to
a revolver concealed in the wall paneling.

01:25:44.552 --> 01:25:47.680
When the victim struck this note....
There you are.

01:25:48.622 --> 01:25:51.489
I don't care much for that.
You're slipping, old girl.

01:25:51.559 --> 01:25:54.460
-What's wrong with it, my dear chap?
-That's too complicated.

01:25:54.528 --> 01:25:57.326
If you're going to kill somebody,
do it simply.

01:25:57.398 --> 01:25:59.093
Am I right, Dr. Sedbusk?

01:25:59.166 --> 01:26:02.431
You're right.
Just as long as you don't get caught.

01:26:02.503 --> 01:26:04.994
-Do the wine, will you?
-Yes, Issie.

01:26:05.806 --> 01:26:07.467
How would you do it simply?

01:26:07.541 --> 01:26:10.704
I don't know, dear.
I'd use the most obvious method.

01:26:10.778 --> 01:26:13.440
The most important thing
is that no one should suspect me.

01:26:13.514 --> 01:26:16.745
-For instance?
-For instance, poison.

01:26:17.084 --> 01:26:20.417
Just use the first one
that came to my mind. Say, arsenic.

01:26:21.689 --> 01:26:22.917
Arsenic.

01:26:23.557 --> 01:26:25.047
I remember...

01:26:25.693 --> 01:26:29.629
in Gloucester, where
we exhumed the body four years after...

01:26:29.697 --> 01:26:33.895
there was still enough poison,
even in the fingernails and the hair.

01:26:34.135 --> 01:26:36.729
Yes, but did you get the murderer?

01:26:37.938 --> 01:26:39.337
Let me see.

01:26:39.974 --> 01:26:41.305
No, I don't think we did.

01:26:41.375 --> 01:26:42.535
There you are.

01:26:42.610 --> 01:26:45.602
Think of it. This very minute,
there are hundreds of people...

01:26:45.679 --> 01:26:48.614
who have committed murder
and they're walking about freely.

01:26:48.682 --> 01:26:49.944
Thousands.

01:26:50.017 --> 01:26:52.815
Do you suppose
those murderers are happy, Johnnie?

01:26:52.887 --> 01:26:55.378
I don't know, dear.
I don't see why they shouldn't be.

01:26:55.456 --> 01:26:57.083
Fear of discovery, my lad.

01:26:57.158 --> 01:27:01.060
So long as arsenic leaves traces and
a bullet's marked by the barrel of a gun...

01:27:01.128 --> 01:27:03.688
and the tiniest hair of your head
can be identified....

01:27:03.764 --> 01:27:08.030
It seems to me by now someone would've
discovered a poison that can't be traced.

01:27:11.872 --> 01:27:13.499
What about it, Doctor?

01:27:14.742 --> 01:27:17.142
A very interesting corpse
dropped in the other day.

01:27:17.211 --> 01:27:21.113
-Do let's hear about it.
-No, please. Don't change the subject.

01:27:21.182 --> 01:27:25.175
I saw that look that passed between you.
There's an untraceable poison, isn't there?

01:27:25.252 --> 01:27:27.220
Nonsense. No such thing.

01:27:27.688 --> 01:27:30.418
I'll bet you know, Doctor. What is it?

01:27:30.791 --> 01:27:32.691
Not in a million years.

01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:35.923
Now, come.
After all, do I look like a murderer?

01:27:35.996 --> 01:27:38.863
That's an interesting question.
What do you think, Issie?

01:27:38.933 --> 01:27:43.131
Issie can tell by looking at a person's face
whether he or she is capable of murder.

01:27:43.204 --> 01:27:44.364
Can't you, Issie?

01:27:44.438 --> 01:27:47.532
I don't want to sound conceited,
but I usuaIly can.

01:27:47.608 --> 01:27:49.508
What about me, dear?
Could I murder anyone?

01:27:49.577 --> 01:27:52.603
You couldn't hurt a fly, Bertram.
Unless it was already dead.

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:56.673
What about Mrs. Aysgarth?
She has a strange glint in her eye.

01:27:56.750 --> 01:28:00.447
I'm afraid not. Lina hasn't the nerve
any more than I have.

01:28:00.688 --> 01:28:03.885
As for you, you silly thing.
Look at the expression on his face.

01:28:03.958 --> 01:28:07.416
Trying to look mysterious, are you?
You can't fool me.

01:28:07.494 --> 01:28:11.055
You couldn't commit a murder
if you tried for 100 years.

01:28:14.068 --> 01:28:16.229
No, I don't believe I could.

01:28:20.641 --> 01:28:23.201
Johnnie, you're locking up.
What about Ethel?

01:28:24.044 --> 01:28:27.207
It's Ethel's day off.
She won't be back until morning.

01:28:27.514 --> 01:28:29.106
What about Cook?

01:28:29.183 --> 01:28:31.151
What's the matter, dear?
Have you forgotten?

01:28:31.218 --> 01:28:33.243
Cook's away on a holiday.

01:29:08.455 --> 01:29:12.391
Darling, you're shivering again.
Do you suppose you're catching cold?

01:29:12.459 --> 01:29:14.256
Yes. I think that's what it must be.

01:29:14.328 --> 01:29:16.990
We have to tuck you into bed.
Get you nice and warm.

01:29:17.064 --> 01:29:19.794
-Take off your coat.
-No, Johnnie. Please don't.

01:29:21.502 --> 01:29:24.630
This reminds me of the day we first met
on the top of the hill...

01:29:24.705 --> 01:29:27.697
when you wouldn't let me unbutton
the top button of your blouse.

01:29:27.775 --> 01:29:29.367
Do you remember?

01:29:32.079 --> 01:29:34.070
I shall never forget it.

01:29:37.551 --> 01:29:40.543
Get undressed, old girl.
What are you waiting for?

01:29:40.621 --> 01:29:45.024
Johnnie, I'm in a state tonight.
I don't know why. I'd like to be alone.

01:29:45.225 --> 01:29:48.058
Would you mind sleeping
in your dressing room?

01:29:50.864 --> 01:29:52.627
Of course I'd mind.

01:29:55.402 --> 01:29:58.633
Please, Johnnie.
I haven't been sleeping very well lately.

01:29:58.839 --> 01:30:00.329
I understand.

01:30:00.574 --> 01:30:04.032
You used to sleep badly
when I wasn't here, and now you....

01:30:05.446 --> 01:30:08.938
All right, if that's how you feel about it.
Good night.

01:30:36.110 --> 01:30:37.668
Feeling better?

01:30:38.145 --> 01:30:39.703
Yes, thank you.

01:30:41.615 --> 01:30:43.776
-Hello, Isobel.
-How are you, my dear?

01:30:43.851 --> 01:30:45.216
All right.

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:49.080
I've been asleep all day, haven't I?

01:30:49.723 --> 01:30:52.283
Isobel's brother gave you
a sleeping pill this morning.

01:30:52.359 --> 01:30:54.554
Your nerves seemed to be all upset.

01:30:55.195 --> 01:30:57.129
We were quite worried about you.

01:30:57.197 --> 01:30:59.256
Cheer up. Bertram had a good look at you.

01:30:59.333 --> 01:31:03.292
AIthough he doesn't usuaIly attend
living people, he's a very able doctor.

01:31:03.370 --> 01:31:06.100
He says all you needed was a little sleep.

01:31:06.473 --> 01:31:10.136
I'll run down and tell Ethel
to fix something for your supper.

01:31:14.281 --> 01:31:16.545
He's one in a million,
that Johnnie of yours.

01:31:16.617 --> 01:31:17.743
Isn't he?

01:31:17.818 --> 01:31:19.718
Do you mind if I smoke?

01:31:19.787 --> 01:31:21.254
Have you been here all afternoon?

01:31:21.321 --> 01:31:23.915
NaturaIly. Ever since Johnnie phoned.

01:31:23.991 --> 01:31:25.652
I warn you. You'd better get well.

01:31:25.726 --> 01:31:28.627
If you leave me alone much longer
with this husband of yours...

01:31:28.695 --> 01:31:30.185
my career will soon be over.

01:31:30.264 --> 01:31:33.722
-He flirted with you, I suppose.
-Flirted? Worse than that.

01:31:33.801 --> 01:31:36.326
He's worming all my secrets out of me.

01:31:36.403 --> 01:31:39.566
I suspect him of writing
a detective story on the side.

01:31:41.108 --> 01:31:42.666
What secrets?

01:31:42.743 --> 01:31:44.768
He's always pestering me.

01:31:44.845 --> 01:31:47.712
I always swear I won't tell him
and I always do.

01:31:48.282 --> 01:31:50.113
Did you tell him anything today?

01:31:50.184 --> 01:31:54.348
Did I? Bertram was furious.
Said he'd never confide in me again.

01:31:54.988 --> 01:31:58.981
But honestly, have you ever been able
to deny Johnnie anything?

01:32:00.027 --> 01:32:01.392
Never.

01:32:02.095 --> 01:32:03.995
It was about that poison, wasn't it?

01:32:04.064 --> 01:32:07.727
Don't remind me of it. I'm ashamed,
and mortified, and disgraced.

01:32:07.801 --> 01:32:11.999
I'm just a fool, that's all. If he writes
a story on that one before I do...

01:32:12.072 --> 01:32:13.972
I suppose I'll deserve it.

01:32:14.041 --> 01:32:17.374
lmagine. A substance
in daily use everywhere.

01:32:17.878 --> 01:32:19.778
Anyone can lay his hands on it.

01:32:19.847 --> 01:32:24.079
And within a minute after taking,
the victim's beautifully out of the way.

01:32:24.151 --> 01:32:27.143
Mind you, it's undetectable after death.

01:32:28.989 --> 01:32:31.617
Is whatever it is painful?

01:32:31.692 --> 01:32:33.250
Not in the least.

01:32:33.327 --> 01:32:36.888
In fact, I should think
it would be a most pleasant death.

01:33:50.938 --> 01:33:52.599
Good night, Lina.

01:34:30.544 --> 01:34:33.138
You're still annoyed with me, aren't you?

01:34:33.213 --> 01:34:36.205
No, Johnnie, reaIly. I still don't feel well.

01:34:36.283 --> 01:34:39.719
A few days at your mother's house
will do more good than staying at home.

01:34:39.786 --> 01:34:43.187
It's not exactly that. Don't you
understand? Mother telephoned me and--

01:34:43.256 --> 01:34:45.816
She got on that telephone
awfully early, it seems to me.

01:34:45.892 --> 01:34:49.191
Mother gets up early,
and she's lonely down there.

01:34:49.262 --> 01:34:51.628
I happened to mention I was a bit nervy...

01:34:51.698 --> 01:34:55.065
and before I knew it I'd agreed
to spend a few days with her.

01:34:55.402 --> 01:34:57.802
All right.
I'll run down and get the car ready.

01:34:57.871 --> 01:35:00.863
-No. I'll drive myself.
-I prefer to drive you.

01:36:03.437 --> 01:36:05.632
I think I'll take the short cut.

01:36:11.078 --> 01:36:12.204
Johnnie!

01:36:14.214 --> 01:36:16.239
Johnnie!

01:36:21.455 --> 01:36:23.389
Lina, what's got into you?

01:36:23.457 --> 01:36:27.416
Lina ! Stop it, you little fool!

01:36:27.627 --> 01:36:30.687
I've had enough! How much do you think
a man can bear? Listen to me!

01:36:30.764 --> 01:36:33.289
You throw me out of your room,
run off to your mother's...

01:36:33.366 --> 01:36:36.460
now you shrink away from me
as though you hated me. You're my wife.

01:36:36.536 --> 01:36:38.128
You almost killed us both back there.

01:36:38.205 --> 01:36:42.767
You pulled away when I was reaching over
to save you from faIling out of the car.

01:36:44.344 --> 01:36:46.744
You don't have to
put up with me anymore.

01:36:47.481 --> 01:36:49.676
Johnnie, where are you going?

01:36:50.217 --> 01:36:53.345
-First, I'm taking you to your mother's.
-And then what?

01:36:53.453 --> 01:36:55.785
Don't worry. I won't bother you again.

01:36:57.357 --> 01:36:59.518
Johnnie, you mean you're going to....

01:36:59.593 --> 01:37:02.960
Why were you asking Isobel
those questions about the poison?

01:37:03.029 --> 01:37:04.894
What were you planning to do with it?

01:37:04.965 --> 01:37:06.990
Johnnie, you were going to kill yourself.

01:37:07.067 --> 01:37:09.194
My darling.

01:37:09.436 --> 01:37:12.166
Yes, but I saw that was a cheap way out.

01:37:12.239 --> 01:37:14.833
I'm going to see it through,
prison term and everything.

01:37:14.908 --> 01:37:17.433
Prison? You mean Melbeck,
that money you took?

01:37:17.511 --> 01:37:18.910
I can't pay it back.

01:37:18.979 --> 01:37:22.210
I made the last attempt to raise the money
when I went away with Beaky.

01:37:22.282 --> 01:37:24.250
-Paris?
-I went to Liverpool.

01:37:24.317 --> 01:37:27.844
I tried to borrow on your insurance,
but it didn't work.

01:37:28.088 --> 01:37:30.283
You were in Liverpool when Beaky....

01:37:30.357 --> 01:37:32.587
Then you didn't go to Paris.

01:37:32.659 --> 01:37:33.785
Of course not.

01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:37.626
You think I'd have let some idiot
give poor old Beaky that brandy if I had?

01:37:38.765 --> 01:37:42.895
Johnnie, if I'd only known.
This is as much my fault as yours.

01:37:43.637 --> 01:37:47.073
I was only thinking of myself,
not what you were going through.

01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:50.075
If I'd been reaIly close to you,
you could've confided in me...

01:37:50.143 --> 01:37:53.271
but you were afraid to.
You were ashamed to come to me.

01:37:53.346 --> 01:37:55.280
If I'd only understood.

01:37:58.084 --> 01:38:01.110
But it will be different now.
We'll make it different.

01:38:02.022 --> 01:38:05.150
People don't change overnight, Lina.
I'm no good.

01:38:05.992 --> 01:38:09.587
Let's turn back. Let's go home
and see it all through together.

01:38:09.663 --> 01:38:12.359
No. It won't work.
I'm driving you on to your mother's.

01:38:12.432 --> 01:38:15.595
It will work. I know it will, Johnnie, please.

01:38:15.869 --> 01:38:17.996
This isn't your problem, Lina.

01:38:18.538 --> 01:38:20.665
But it is. You can't shut me out.

01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:24.369
Turn the car around and let's go home.
Please, Johnnie.

01:38:25.111 --> 01:38:26.772
No, Lina.

01:38:28.882 --> 01:38:30.372
My darling.

01:39:29.609 --> 01:39:30.598
