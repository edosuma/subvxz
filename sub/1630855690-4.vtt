WEBVTT

00:43.085 --> 00:45.212
- Agh!

00:47.798 --> 00:50.384
Alice. Alice!

00:51.510 --> 00:53.179
Oh, my God!

00:54.680 --> 00:56.223
Alice!

00:57.892 --> 00:59.268
Fuck!

02:45.291 --> 02:49.003
- So, was she drunk?
- No, I don't think so.

02:49.003 --> 02:51.297
Try her phone again.

02:51.297 --> 02:53.841
- Ugh, it's switched off.
- Keep trying.

02:57.553 --> 03:01.265
All I remember is seeing her
putting flowers in your room

03:01.265 --> 03:03.809
for your return from the dead.

03:03.809 --> 03:06.312
Yellow bells and violets.

03:07.521 --> 03:11.150
Then she went to town for supplies
to see out the storm.

03:14.236 --> 03:16.322
Oh! Post office.

03:16.322 --> 03:19.825
She was going to grab the mail
from the P.O. box in town.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.042
Where are you?

03:28.042 --> 03:30.044
Look, I don't know
what's going on with you,

03:30.044 --> 03:32.338
but, please, just let me know
you're OK.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.090
Bye.

03:45.309 --> 03:48.479
Oi! You just had your uterus out.

03:48.479 --> 03:51.565
You'll be popping your stitches.
Get up, June, come on.

03:55.194 --> 03:57.112
- Oh, goodness.

04:02.451 --> 04:04.662
Go into town and ask everyone we know

04:04.662 --> 04:06.413
if they've seen her, heard from her.

04:07.623 --> 04:10.668
Get the police to put
an alert on her truck,

04:10.668 --> 04:14.254
and I'll stay here in case she calls.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.965
This is fun.

04:15.965 --> 04:18.133
Come on.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.111
Ow.

06:07.910 --> 06:10.621
All the test results
are good.

06:10.621 --> 06:13.207
Everything's healed up perfectly.

06:13.207 --> 06:16.001
So the other kidney's OK?

06:16.001 --> 06:19.797
Yes. He'll be fine.
Better than fine.

06:19.797 --> 06:22.049
Oh!

06:23.258 --> 06:24.843
So we don't have to come back?

06:24.843 --> 06:28.097
Unless there's a problem, no.

06:28.097 --> 06:29.556
That's what we've been waiting for.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.771
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.530
-  Hi. You've called...
- Sa...

06:44.530 --> 06:46.031
..Sally Morgan, please leave a message

06:46.031 --> 06:47.783
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can.

06:49.660 --> 06:52.246
Uh, call me soon as you get this.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.750
It's June.

07:37.875 --> 07:41.545
-  Hey!

07:43.046 --> 07:44.673
Hey!

07:44.673 --> 07:46.425
- Hey! Stop!

07:47.885 --> 07:49.595
- Stop it! What are you doing?

07:54.057 --> 07:55.767
Hey, hey. Come here.

07:55.767 --> 07:57.060
Fuck off, dog.

07:58.395 --> 07:59.730
Hey.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.317
- Are you lost?

09:01.667 --> 09:04.753
Should a woman
just out of hospital be...

09:04.753 --> 09:06.797
taking those with whiskey?

09:06.797 --> 09:09.883
Should a woman in her 60s
still be smoking weed?

09:15.097 --> 09:17.474
One good thing,
if you do have cancer,

09:17.474 --> 09:20.811
we could grow this stuff legitimately
and make a bloody fortune.

09:22.062 --> 09:26.108
- Well, then, bring on the cancer.
- I'm joking.

09:41.832 --> 09:43.667
June speaking.

09:45.002 --> 09:47.879
Uh, I got your messages.

09:47.879 --> 09:51.008
And, no, I haven't heard from Alice.

09:51.008 --> 09:53.635
You didn't send her a letter?
Or call her?

09:53.635 --> 09:55.762
No. Like I said, I...

09:57.180 --> 09:59.016
Alice made it really clear to us

09:59.016 --> 10:00.809
that she didn't want
any further contact,

10:00.809 --> 10:02.686
and we have respected that.

10:02.686 --> 10:05.355
I mean, it's been 14 years.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.609
Do you have any idea
where she might be?

10:09.609 --> 10:12.487
I'm sure she's fine.
Alice can take care of herself.

10:14.156 --> 10:17.534
If you do hear from her,
please let me know.

10:22.164 --> 10:25.417
It's Tess. From the markets.

10:56.531 --> 10:58.075
Ugh.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.120
How could you?

11:44.913 --> 11:46.581
June.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.625
- Agh!
- June, wake up.

11:51.169 --> 11:53.505
Jesus, you're burning up.

11:53.505 --> 11:54.798
Are you in pain?

11:57.926 --> 11:59.344
Oh, God.

12:02.264 --> 12:05.308
- Is your medication up here?
-  Yeah.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.827
Oh, my God, we made it, Pip.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.704
- What's happened?

13:50.872 --> 13:52.415
Fuck.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.878
Oh, you poor little thing.

13:56.878 --> 13:58.213
Shit.

13:58.213 --> 13:59.798
It's OK.

13:59.798 --> 14:01.758
-  Fuck.

14:02.801 --> 14:05.303
- Oh, God.

14:05.303 --> 14:07.222
Oh...

14:08.890 --> 14:10.809
Oh, you poor little thing.

14:13.979 --> 14:16.273
It's OK. It's going to be OK.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.775
Ugh...

14:32.372 --> 14:33.748
Hello.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.792
Sorry, we close at one
on Saturday.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.298
Who do we have here?

14:42.382 --> 14:45.218
She won't stop crying
and there's blood in her urine.

14:47.012 --> 14:49.139
Hey, there.

14:49.139 --> 14:50.974
You've been in the wars.

14:52.350 --> 14:53.810
How old is she?

14:53.810 --> 14:56.229
I don't know.
I found her at a truck stop.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.106
You must be new here.

14:58.106 --> 15:00.150
Locals won't touch strays.

15:01.192 --> 15:03.403
Mmm, she's a bit of a mess.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.905
Urinary tract infection, mites.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.283
She's underweight.
Poor little thing.

15:09.701 --> 15:12.162
- You definitely need some TLC.

15:15.040 --> 15:17.042
Don't worry.
I'll take good care of her.

15:19.628 --> 15:22.297
You can wash your hands, if you like.

15:28.511 --> 15:31.890
Just might grab some details...

15:31.890 --> 15:34.351
name, phone, address,
that kind of thing.

15:34.351 --> 15:35.727
Heya.

15:35.727 --> 15:38.063
Um, Alice.

15:40.065 --> 15:42.317
It's all I have right now.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.281
Everyone calls me Moss.

15:56.247 --> 15:58.458
Come on, boys, don't.

16:43.753 --> 16:48.133
- What happened?
- You fainted.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.759
Here.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.888
Just... go slow.

16:55.056 --> 16:56.474
Ugh.

16:57.726 --> 16:59.644
When did you last eat or drink?

17:02.856 --> 17:04.733
Hey, fellas, hang somewhere else.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.237
I'm fine.

17:11.156 --> 17:14.993
I... don't think you should drive.

17:14.993 --> 17:16.995
I can give you a lift.

17:16.995 --> 17:18.705
Um, I'm fine.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.376
Maybe you should start your own
car detailing business,

17:23.376 --> 17:26.087
'cause... that's really something.

17:28.256 --> 17:30.675
Hey, Alice...

17:30.675 --> 17:32.427
I can drive you to a hotel...

17:32.427 --> 17:34.721
Look, I'm perfectly capable
of checking into a hotel by myself.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.848
OK? I'm not some
delicate fucking flower.

18:34.072 --> 18:37.033
Mum wants to go back
to Bulgaria one day.

18:37.033 --> 18:41.788
So when I'm older, I'm going to take
her home to the Valley of the Roses,

18:41.788 --> 18:43.665
where we're from.

18:43.665 --> 18:46.251
She says queens
are buried under the roses,

18:46.251 --> 18:49.629
and that's why the roses
smell so sweet.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.757
Actually, I made that last bit up.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.558
-  Where else should we go?
- The Bronte house.

19:01.558 --> 19:03.810
I want to sit at the desk that
they wrote at,

19:03.810 --> 19:05.270
and look out over the cemetery.

19:05.270 --> 19:06.896
Uh... Bulgakov.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.231
- Mm-hm.
- The Red Square.

19:08.231 --> 19:10.024
- See where Moscow meets the devil.
- Yes.

19:11.317 --> 19:14.112
- Cherry blossoms, Murakami.
- Japan.

19:14.112 --> 19:15.947
Yeah. We have to go there.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.291
I'd go anywhere with you.

19:35.174 --> 19:39.053
You do know, if we leave, though,
I can't come back here, right?

19:40.680 --> 19:44.684
When we left Dad,
he went back to Bulgaria

19:44.684 --> 19:46.686
and Mum and I should have gone too.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.605
We're here illegally.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.481
So if we leave the country,

19:50.481 --> 19:53.484
I can't come back, Alice.

20:03.286 --> 20:05.455
Let's run away together.

20:06.581 --> 20:08.791
How about we elope?

20:08.791 --> 20:11.085
What if... What if we got married,
and we had two passports

20:11.085 --> 20:13.421
and then we could live and work
wherever we wanted and...

20:14.589 --> 20:16.841
Are you asking me to marry you?

20:19.594 --> 20:21.262
Yeah.

20:23.681 --> 20:25.475
Yes.

20:25.475 --> 20:28.227
It'll be a secret.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.064
Yeah, it's our secret.

20:31.064 --> 20:34.984
..these two things
can never be reunited ever again.

20:36.694 --> 20:38.196
It's a plastic bottle.

20:38.196 --> 20:41.032
If we put it in landfills,
it'll be there for 1,000 years.

22:52.747 --> 22:54.582
I'm so sorry, Alice.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.255
Someone called Immigration...

23:02.381 --> 23:04.425
..and Oggi's been deported.

23:17.647 --> 23:19.232
Dear Alice,

23:19.232 --> 23:22.068
I know you wrote that you
didn't want to hear from me again.

23:26.656 --> 23:29.492
But for five years now,
I've been writing to you

23:29.492 --> 23:32.578
because I really did believe
that you loved me.

23:33.621 --> 23:34.956
For a long time,

23:34.956 --> 23:37.708
I couldn't accept that you'd
end our relationship like that...

23:37.708 --> 23:39.252
by email.

23:39.252 --> 23:42.255
Not after everything
that we'd promised each other.

23:42.255 --> 23:44.715
I'm writing to tell you...

23:44.715 --> 23:47.385
I finally did take that trip
that we'd planned.

23:47.385 --> 23:48.761
And I met someone.

23:51.097 --> 23:52.974
Her name is Anna.

23:52.974 --> 23:55.268
We're getting married, Alice.

24:08.364 --> 24:09.907
Oh, dear.

24:16.831 --> 24:18.207
Alice!

24:19.625 --> 24:21.419
Did you know?

24:21.419 --> 24:23.004
Were you part of it?

24:23.004 --> 24:25.047
A part of what?

24:25.047 --> 24:27.008
Getting rid of Oggi,

24:27.008 --> 24:29.886
the letters, all the fucking lies.

24:29.886 --> 24:31.888
What...? What are you talking about?

24:31.888 --> 24:34.515
Oggi sent me a letter, but it's
the only one that's made it to me

24:34.515 --> 24:36.726
because June destroyed the rest.

24:36.726 --> 24:39.061
She blocked his emails,
she sent him an email

24:39.061 --> 24:41.772
pretending to be me, dumping him.

24:44.358 --> 24:47.028
She had him fucking deported!

24:49.697 --> 24:51.866
Oh, I'm so sorry, Alice.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.119
You tell her
I fucking know everything...

24:56.454 --> 24:59.290
...about all her controlling bullshit.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.587
She took away the only man
I've ever loved.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.049
And now he's getting married.

25:11.385 --> 25:13.346
Where are you?

25:13.346 --> 25:14.805
I can't tell you.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.934
And I'm not coming back.

25:21.479 --> 25:22.980
I hate her.

27:31.442 --> 27:32.526
Hey.

27:33.778 --> 27:35.112
Hey.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.740
Going for a swim?

27:39.283 --> 27:40.785
Yeah.

27:40.785 --> 27:42.411
No water here.

27:42.411 --> 27:44.163
The waterhole's all dried up.

27:45.206 --> 27:46.707
Well, they lied.

27:48.667 --> 27:51.087
Still worth the walk.

27:53.130 --> 27:54.507
May I?

28:02.098 --> 28:04.350
If you do want to swim...

28:05.559 --> 28:07.478
...this is the place.

28:07.478 --> 28:08.979
Jalngay waterhole.

28:08.979 --> 28:11.774
About an hour's drive.

28:11.774 --> 28:15.778
But you have to get there
right on magic hour: 7:30.

28:15.778 --> 28:17.613
You wait and see.

28:17.613 --> 28:18.906
It's, uh...

28:18.906 --> 28:20.199
...magic.

28:24.286 --> 28:25.413
Thank you.

28:27.915 --> 28:29.291
Do you like flowers?

28:30.418 --> 28:31.961
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I do.

28:31.961 --> 28:35.256
Well, when it does rain here,

28:35.256 --> 28:39.468
this whole place becomes
a sea of desert flowers.

28:42.596 --> 28:44.807
I'd like to see that.

28:47.351 --> 28:49.019
Yeah.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.565
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

28:56.902 --> 28:58.779
Jalngay.

28:58.779 --> 29:01.323
7:30. About an hour's drive.

29:04.118 --> 29:05.578
Got it.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.825
I'm sorry. I'll pay for it.

29:45.993 --> 29:50.372
Moss rang. Your dog's ready,
but you can't keep it here.

29:51.415 --> 29:54.043
Oh. Um... OK.

29:54.043 --> 29:56.337
Oh, you look so good.

29:56.337 --> 29:58.506
Thank you so much.

29:59.632 --> 30:01.258
She looks so much better.

30:03.719 --> 30:05.221
Um...

30:06.430 --> 30:08.557
I can't keep her at the pub.

30:09.892 --> 30:12.353
Would it be OK if she just
stays here a few more days

30:12.353 --> 30:14.146
just until I get myself sorted?

30:15.397 --> 30:17.358
I'm sorry I was so rude.

30:17.358 --> 30:19.860
Especially when you've been so nice.

30:19.860 --> 30:21.612
I know we don't know each other
very well...

30:21.612 --> 30:24.782
Well, I know you're
shit at car detailing.

30:24.782 --> 30:27.409
You like to smash mirrors.
And you love a minibar.

30:29.703 --> 30:34.750
For a big town,
it's, um, pretty small.

30:34.750 --> 30:37.503
Buy me a drink
and I'll take Pip to my place.

30:37.503 --> 30:40.214
More room for her to run around.

30:47.054 --> 30:48.681
So, why did you pick here?

30:50.099 --> 30:52.518
Um, same name as my mum's.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.186
"Agnes".

30:54.186 --> 30:56.522
I kind of took it as a sign.

30:57.856 --> 31:00.985
What's under all the butterflies
on your truck?

31:02.236 --> 31:04.905
- A sign.

31:04.905 --> 31:07.992
Um, Alice Hart, Floriographer.

31:07.992 --> 31:10.494
No idea what it means,
but it sounds impressive.

31:10.494 --> 31:12.913
- I grew up on a flower farm.
- A flower farm?

31:12.913 --> 31:15.833
- Mmm.
- Did you milk roses?

31:15.833 --> 31:18.210
The machines must be really fiddly.

31:20.879 --> 31:24.174
We specialise in Australian natives.

31:24.174 --> 31:26.218
Where I'm from,
all flowers have meanings.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.512
My family prefer using them
to real words.

31:28.512 --> 31:31.765
It's how we communicate,
flowers, floriography.

31:33.350 --> 31:34.977
Can I have a look?

31:36.812 --> 31:38.397
Yeah.

31:48.616 --> 31:50.200
"Resurrection."

31:51.410 --> 31:53.329
"My hidden worth."

31:53.329 --> 31:56.165
"By your love I live and die."

31:58.125 --> 32:00.461
"My hidden worth...
Are they all so dramatic?

32:00.461 --> 32:02.546
Is there one for, uh...

32:02.546 --> 32:04.506
'it's bin night'?

32:04.506 --> 32:07.593
Or 'your hair looks quite nice'?

32:14.224 --> 32:16.101
Do you need to be somewhere?

32:21.357 --> 32:25.152
No. No.

32:27.112 --> 32:30.407
- So, Miss Floriographer...
- Yes.

32:30.407 --> 32:31.825
What does moss mean?

32:33.452 --> 32:36.413
I am WAY too sober to tell you that.

32:36.413 --> 32:39.291
- That bad, huh?
- Well, uh...

32:39.291 --> 32:41.710
Another round, then.

32:41.710 --> 32:43.754
Let's do another round.

32:43.754 --> 32:45.589
You want to do shots?

32:56.350 --> 32:58.769
"Courage In The Face Of Fear".

32:58.769 --> 33:01.313
My mum has this.

33:01.313 --> 33:04.274
Not that I want to be
thinking about her right now.

33:04.274 --> 33:05.651
Old-school.

33:05.651 --> 33:07.653
Haven't seen one of these in ages.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.799
Maybe I should go.

33:30.926 --> 33:33.387
Besides, now I'm worried that

33:33.387 --> 33:36.640
moss means "bad breath."

33:36.640 --> 33:39.393
Or "touches slow and creepy".

33:49.903 --> 33:51.447
Thanks for today.

33:52.823 --> 33:54.533
I had fun.

33:55.868 --> 33:57.911
Don't go.

33:57.911 --> 33:59.830
I... I want you to stay.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.051
Are you sure?

34:18.807 --> 34:20.851
Why do you have
so many buttons?

34:35.032 --> 34:36.700
- How about that?
- OK.

34:38.494 --> 34:40.579
Zip!

34:42.372 --> 34:44.208
- Um...

34:44.208 --> 34:46.376
You've been going commando all day?

34:46.376 --> 34:49.171
-  Well, I really...

34:49.171 --> 34:51.340
...didn't know
this was going to happen.

35:55.696 --> 35:58.282
What are you doing, darl?

36:00.075 --> 36:01.493
Alice was right.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.370
What?

36:03.370 --> 36:05.205
You heard from her?

36:07.124 --> 36:09.751
When? Is she alright?

36:09.751 --> 36:11.336
Did you know?

36:11.336 --> 36:13.046
Know what?

36:13.046 --> 36:14.965
That June got rid of Oggi.

36:19.678 --> 36:20.721
Is Alice OK?

36:20.721 --> 36:22.306
- Of course she's not!
- Well, where is she?

36:22.306 --> 36:25.142
Even if I did know,
why the fuck would I tell you?

36:34.026 --> 36:35.527
Alice called Candy.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.404
The letter, it was from Oggi.

36:38.572 --> 36:39.990
Oggi...

36:41.074 --> 36:44.912
Oh... Oh, God.

36:44.912 --> 36:48.248
- It's not funny.

36:48.248 --> 36:50.042
What is wrong with you?

36:50.042 --> 36:52.753
I thought something terrible
had happened to her.

36:52.753 --> 36:55.589
It has. She knows.

36:55.589 --> 36:57.591
Oh, I should have never bloody
listened to you.

36:57.591 --> 36:59.968
Oh, come on. That was years ago.

36:59.968 --> 37:02.262
We didn't want her to
throw her life away on Oggi

37:02.262 --> 37:04.097
and move to bloody Bulgaria.

37:04.097 --> 37:05.515
We agreed.

37:12.272 --> 37:15.484
So does Candy know where Alice is?

37:16.735 --> 37:17.903
No.

37:19.863 --> 37:22.115
You need to fix this, June.

37:22.115 --> 37:25.118
I am not losing another child.

37:39.883 --> 37:43.220
Uh, hello? John's phone.
Charlie speaking.

37:46.181 --> 37:47.391
Hello?

37:49.267 --> 37:50.894
Is there anyone there?

37:53.188 --> 37:55.315
It's June Hart.

37:55.315 --> 37:56.775
June?

38:00.028 --> 38:02.531
Uh, it's... It's me.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.325
It's Charlie.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.871
Hey, you might want to
hear my news...

38:09.871 --> 38:11.873
Could you put your father
on the phone, please?

38:13.166 --> 38:15.460
He's covered in flour right now.

38:15.460 --> 38:18.046
We're actually having
a bit of a celebration...

38:18.046 --> 38:20.632
Put your father on the phone.
I don't have all day.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.770
- You OK?
- Mm-hm.

38:36.148 --> 38:38.066
Uh, June, how can I help?

38:40.152 --> 38:42.487
I need your help finding Alice.

39:38.794 --> 39:42.089
John Morgan's going to
help us find...

39:48.220 --> 39:50.347
June!

39:51.932 --> 39:55.102
Candy! Candy!

39:55.102 --> 39:56.311
June!

39:57.562 --> 39:59.523
- What happened?
- I don't know.

39:59.523 --> 40:01.900
- June!

40:16.706 --> 40:18.125
Woo-hoo!

40:20.794 --> 40:22.087
Yeah!

40:27.384 --> 40:30.095
How did you know about this place?

40:30.095 --> 40:31.555
A friend.

40:34.975 --> 40:36.226
Come on.

40:44.776 --> 40:47.612
Just watch out for, uh...

40:47.612 --> 40:50.115
Don't say crocodiles.
Are there crocodiles?!

40:50.115 --> 40:52.826
- Are there crocodiles?!

41:13.430 --> 41:15.640
So tell me about your family.

41:15.640 --> 41:19.311
Uh, I see them, a few times a year.

41:19.311 --> 41:22.105
After a couple of days,
I can't wait to come home.

41:22.105 --> 41:25.108
- Don't get me wrong, right?

41:25.108 --> 41:27.485
I love them. It's just...

41:28.570 --> 41:30.947
I don't know. I miss... the desert.

41:32.282 --> 41:34.492
Miss feeling insignificant.

41:37.746 --> 41:40.248
What about your parents?
Where do they live?

41:42.125 --> 41:44.836
Uh, they died, when I was nine.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.755
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

41:46.755 --> 41:48.089
Seriously.

41:48.089 --> 41:49.549
- I always stick my foot in it.
- No, no, no, no.

41:49.549 --> 41:51.384
That's why you were brought up
by your grandmother...

41:51.384 --> 41:52.761
- Yeah.
- ...on the farm.

41:52.761 --> 41:54.179
It's OK.

41:54.179 --> 41:59.142
I mean, now I can't
go back there either, but...

42:00.393 --> 42:01.770
Why?

42:03.063 --> 42:04.940
She's lying and controlling,

42:04.940 --> 42:08.902
and she's got rid of anyone
that's ever shown any interest in me.

42:08.902 --> 42:11.696
- She'd get rid of you.
- Is that right?

42:11.696 --> 42:13.615
- Mmm.
- How's she going to do that?

42:13.615 --> 42:16.159
Well, she's got her ways.

42:16.159 --> 42:17.702
Well, I...

42:19.120 --> 42:21.706
...guess you'll just have to
stay here, then.

42:29.089 --> 42:31.007
Just don't look. Honestly...

42:31.007 --> 42:33.927
- Who are these people?
- I do not know these people, OK?

42:33.927 --> 42:36.471
- No...

42:36.471 --> 42:40.267
Margaritas, please. Four jugs.
No, no, no. Make it five.

42:40.267 --> 42:42.602
No, no, no!

42:42.602 --> 42:45.772
- Hey.
- Hi.

42:47.357 --> 42:49.651
I-I'm Lulu.

42:49.651 --> 42:51.194
Alice.

42:51.194 --> 42:52.654
Come and join us.

42:52.654 --> 42:55.115
It's Thugger's birthday drinks tonight.

42:55.115 --> 42:56.700
Let's go!

42:58.743 --> 43:02.247
Thanks, Merle. I got five...

43:32.110 --> 43:34.070
Do you think he's alright?

43:34.070 --> 43:37.157
He has hardly spoken all night.

43:37.157 --> 43:38.992
He's a 14-year-old boy.

43:38.992 --> 43:41.161
Pretty non-verbal, as a rule.

43:41.161 --> 43:44.122
We were celebrating,
and June called and fucked it.

43:44.122 --> 43:45.915
So, you know that.

43:45.915 --> 43:48.126
She was worried about Alice.

43:49.336 --> 43:52.297
- Are you making excuses for her?
- I'm going to bed.

43:53.340 --> 43:55.008
Don't stay up too late.

44:06.269 --> 44:09.522
♪ Love
is a burning thing

44:12.317 --> 44:15.653
♪ And it makes
a fiery ring

44:20.450 --> 44:22.369
♪ By wild desire

44:25.246 --> 44:28.208
♪ I fell into the ring of fire... ♪

44:29.417 --> 44:33.296
♪ I fell into
a burning ring of fire... ♪

44:33.296 --> 44:35.715
Dude, I can't believe you haven't
been out to the crater yet.

44:35.715 --> 44:38.134
The national park: it's literally
why everyone comes here.

44:38.134 --> 44:40.136
- It sounds amazing.
- It is.

44:40.136 --> 44:41.721
You know what?

44:41.721 --> 44:44.057
I'm going to put you on the list
for the sunset tour tomorrow.

44:44.057 --> 44:46.309
Oh, I would LOVE that!
I would LOVE that.

44:46.309 --> 44:47.811
You AND Moss.

45:01.032 --> 45:02.617
Fuck it.

45:07.580 --> 45:10.458
-  Goodness.

45:13.002 --> 45:14.295
June's phone.

45:14.295 --> 45:16.714
Oh, yes. May I speak with her,
please? It's urgent.

45:16.714 --> 45:19.217
She's not available,
but maybe I could help.

45:19.217 --> 45:21.636
Oh, yeah, actually, you can.

45:21.636 --> 45:23.596
You could tell her that

45:23.596 --> 45:26.182
if she had
bothered to listen to him today,

45:26.182 --> 45:30.145
she'd know that her grandson
has been given a clean bill of health.

45:30.145 --> 45:31.813
Do you think, would it take too much

45:31.813 --> 45:33.982
to just pretend that she fucking cares?

45:33.982 --> 45:36.359
Uh, I'm sorry. W-W-Who is this?

45:36.359 --> 45:39.070
Sally Morgan. We have done our bit.

45:39.070 --> 45:42.615
We have kept June up to date
with all of Charlie's health issues,

45:42.615 --> 45:45.076
and she can't even bring herself
to say hello.

45:46.369 --> 45:48.163
No wonder Alice has taken off.

45:48.163 --> 45:50.623
Probably couldn't stand
another minute under her roof.

45:52.750 --> 45:54.836
If you do hear from Alice.

45:54.836 --> 45:59.257
Could you let her know that
her brother would love to meet her?

46:01.009 --> 46:02.635
Hello?

46:03.845 --> 46:05.263
Are you there?

47:39.566 --> 47:41.276
Oh, you bitch.

47:43.945 --> 47:45.613
Oh, you bitch.

47:45.613 --> 47:47.115
Bitch.

47:49.117 --> 47:51.327
Oh, you fucking bitch!

48:04.757 --> 48:06.676
Oh, goodness.

48:08.595 --> 48:10.096
Oh, look at you.

48:12.682 --> 48:13.975
Oh...

48:44.672 --> 48:46.174
Whoa. You OK?

48:49.802 --> 48:52.180
You are waterhole man.

48:55.141 --> 48:58.061
I didn't pick you for a smoker.

48:58.061 --> 48:59.646
Wow. I must be drunk.

49:00.772 --> 49:03.358
Oh, it's Dylan, by the way.

49:03.358 --> 49:04.776
Alice.

49:08.446 --> 49:10.657
You know, I went to...

49:10.657 --> 49:13.201
- Jan... Janglay waterhole today.

49:13.201 --> 49:16.871
- Uh-huh.
- And it was magic at magic hour.

49:16.871 --> 49:18.498
I went too.

49:18.498 --> 49:19.832
Yesterday.

49:25.963 --> 49:28.424
Sturt Desert Pea.

49:33.346 --> 49:35.723
- Beautiful.

49:35.723 --> 49:37.183
Dylan!

49:37.183 --> 49:39.811
When did you get here?

49:39.811 --> 49:41.938
- Just now.
- Did you meet Alice?

49:41.938 --> 49:43.815
She's the best thing about tonight.

49:43.815 --> 49:44.899
Mmm.

49:44.899 --> 49:46.901
Hey, I just bought another round.
Are you coming inside?

49:46.901 --> 49:48.861
Oh, I just need some fresh air.

49:48.861 --> 49:50.321
- OK.
- You OK?

49:50.321 --> 49:52.323
- Yes.
- Sure?

49:52.323 --> 49:54.283
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm?

51:09.942 --> 51:13.196
Who messages this early on a Sunday?

51:18.284 --> 51:21.621
It's Lulu. She put me down
for the sunset tour at the crater.

51:27.919 --> 51:29.670
She could only get one ticket.

51:31.339 --> 51:33.549
That's fine. I've been before.

51:35.343 --> 51:37.637
Don't fancy the four-hour round trip.

51:40.348 --> 51:43.643
Those bloody shots...

51:57.448 --> 51:59.325
Where's Twig?

51:59.325 --> 52:00.535
Sally called.

52:01.536 --> 52:03.287
Twig knows about Charlie.

52:05.039 --> 52:06.541
We both do.

52:13.923 --> 52:15.842
Hey. Stop. Hey!

52:15.842 --> 52:18.427
No. Hey, no! I'm not...

52:18.427 --> 52:20.304
Hey, get down.

52:21.472 --> 52:23.933
June, no, no.

52:51.043 --> 52:53.963
They said he was dying.

52:53.963 --> 52:57.300
The last thing Alice needed
was to lose another family member.

52:57.300 --> 52:59.218
Fuck you, June.

52:59.218 --> 53:01.178
He's 14.

53:01.178 --> 53:05.308
You let Alice blame herself
for his death, knowing he was alive?

53:05.308 --> 53:07.435
- Her brother!
- I didn't see it that way.

53:07.435 --> 53:09.353
You're a fucking coward.

53:09.353 --> 53:11.522
Yes, I am.

53:11.522 --> 53:14.650
This is Clem's son
we're talking about.

53:14.650 --> 53:17.820
I was afraid of
what that child might do.

53:17.820 --> 53:19.739
That's her blood. That's her brother.

53:19.739 --> 53:21.699
Alice could have grown up
with Charlie.

53:23.701 --> 53:26.162
When they took my kids from me,
the only thing...

53:26.162 --> 53:28.915
the only thing that got me through

53:28.915 --> 53:31.792
was the thought that
they were together.

53:31.792 --> 53:33.544
And don't you pretend
you don't know that!

53:33.544 --> 53:35.755
- I know.
- No!

53:37.089 --> 53:41.177
All this time, you lied to us,
lied to Alice.

53:41.177 --> 53:43.763
Controlled who she could see,
who she could love.

53:43.763 --> 53:45.848
How are you any different
to all those men out there

53:45.848 --> 53:47.266
that you hate so much?

53:47.266 --> 53:50.853
I made the best decisions
in the interest of this family.

53:52.438 --> 53:53.814
Bullshit!

54:44.615 --> 54:46.117
-  Alice!
- Hey!

54:46.117 --> 54:47.576
You made it!

54:49.370 --> 54:50.705
Where's Moss?

54:50.705 --> 54:52.456
Uh, he... he couldn't come.

54:52.456 --> 54:53.708
OK.

54:57.962 --> 54:59.964
Thank you, everyone,
for joining us.

54:59.964 --> 55:02.466
We're so excited that
you're here on country.

55:02.466 --> 55:05.302
This country belongs to
the Western Arrarnta people,

55:05.302 --> 55:07.221
which was my grandmother's country,

55:07.221 --> 55:09.640
my mother's country and our country.

55:09.640 --> 55:12.893
And we're very honoured
to have you here and join us today.

55:12.893 --> 55:14.979
The story that
we're going to share with you

55:14.979 --> 55:16.981
is the one that we tell all the kids,

55:16.981 --> 55:19.066
usually sitting round the campfire.

55:19.066 --> 55:22.069
And we do this so that
we keep our culture,

55:22.069 --> 55:24.822
our songs and our stories alive.

55:43.257 --> 55:47.261
One evening, the star women
were dancing on the Milky Way

55:47.261 --> 55:50.056
and a mother put her baby
in the Turna,

55:50.056 --> 55:52.892
a shallow wooden dish
with curved sides,

55:52.892 --> 55:54.560
while she danced.

55:56.020 --> 55:58.731
The baby rocked from side to side,

55:58.731 --> 56:02.693
and rocked so hard she fell
from the stars to the earth.

56:05.529 --> 56:07.865
The Turna landed on top of the baby
and covered her,

56:07.865 --> 56:09.950
forming a crater.

56:14.246 --> 56:17.625
The baby's mother and father
saw that she was gone.

56:18.918 --> 56:21.587
They searched everywhere.

56:21.587 --> 56:24.381
But they couldn't see their child
under the Turna.

56:25.633 --> 56:27.843
And they cried out in pain.

56:38.229 --> 56:42.733
To this day, the walls of the crater
protect the baby.

56:42.733 --> 56:47.696
We still see the parents,
the evening and morning stars,

56:47.696 --> 56:50.241
moving across the sky,

56:50.241 --> 56:53.619
as they search endlessly
for their precious child.

58:11.780 --> 58:13.532
I'm here, Mum.

59:13.550 --> 59:15.344
I'm here.
