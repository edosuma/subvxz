WEBVTT

00:01.467 --> 00:03.069
SHORE:
Previously on The Practice.

00:03.103 --> 00:05.539
Oh. (breathing heavily)

00:06.573 --> 00:07.574
Brenda Wilbur,

00:07.608 --> 00:08.474
who I believed you know.

00:08.509 --> 00:09.710
Brenda Wilbur.
Yes.

00:10.376 --> 00:12.312
She's dead.
What?

00:12.345 --> 00:13.914
Somebody bludgeoned her
or something.

00:13.947 --> 00:15.616
Wait, wait, wait. Slow down.
The police are out there.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.751
I was there.
I had made love to her earlier,

00:17.784 --> 00:19.586
and now they're here
to ask me questions.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.354
Paul Stewart,
are you his lawyer?

00:21.387 --> 00:22.656
Mrs. Piper.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.657
Alan Shore.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.058
I grew up here in Dedham.

00:25.091 --> 00:26.727
I need money, Alan.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.162
So much so I sometimes see it
in my dreams.

00:29.195 --> 00:31.832
I, especially, saw it
at 10:30 last night,

00:31.865 --> 00:33.266
when I saw Paul Stewart

00:33.299 --> 00:35.201
coming out of Brenda's house.

00:35.235 --> 00:36.737
How are we arranging
to pay her off?

00:36.770 --> 00:38.672
I cannot bribe

00:38.705 --> 00:39.873
this witness.

00:40.273 --> 00:42.042
I'm not letting my only child

00:42.075 --> 00:42.909
go to prison.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.578
SHORE: As a childhood friend

00:44.611 --> 00:45.546
who grew up with you,

00:46.446 --> 00:48.348
did you commit this crime?

00:48.381 --> 00:50.150
The answer's no,

00:50.183 --> 00:51.417
I did not.

00:51.451 --> 00:54.220
SHORE: Wives don't statistically
leave their husbands

00:54.254 --> 00:55.989
over infidelity.

00:56.022 --> 00:57.958
With the remotest possibility

00:57.991 --> 00:59.192
that you walking out

00:59.225 --> 01:00.667
could be perceived
as you thinking

01:00.701 --> 01:02.035
he's guilty of murder,

01:02.068 --> 01:03.403
and there is that possibility.

01:03.436 --> 01:05.105
You cannot walk out
that door now.

01:05.138 --> 01:07.273
Maybe I do think
he's guilty of murder.

01:07.307 --> 01:09.008
Brenda Wilbur
was a beloved member

01:09.042 --> 01:10.110
of this community,

01:10.143 --> 01:11.878
a lifelong resident.

01:11.912 --> 01:13.446
SHORE: I'm assuming
she practiced confession.

01:13.479 --> 01:14.781
Did she ever
mention anything?

01:15.616 --> 01:17.183
if you know anything

01:17.217 --> 01:18.652
you can share, Tom?

01:19.119 --> 01:20.486
I can't break

01:20.521 --> 01:22.122
the confessional seal.

01:22.589 --> 01:23.790
Did he do this?

01:25.458 --> 01:26.927
People change.

01:27.728 --> 01:30.330
If you only knew
what I had become.

01:30.697 --> 01:32.465
When you were 16,

01:32.498 --> 01:35.168
you slept
with your best friend's mother.

01:37.270 --> 01:39.139
How have you changed, Alan?

01:42.242 --> 01:44.077
All I'm asking,
without breaking the seal

01:44.110 --> 01:46.513
of any specific confession,

01:46.547 --> 01:49.082
is that you reveal to me
generally whether any--

01:49.115 --> 01:51.184
Uh, I thought we were going
out for beers, old friends.

01:51.217 --> 01:52.953
You know something.

01:53.887 --> 01:55.088
Why do you insist on that?

01:55.121 --> 01:56.657
Because I can read you.

01:57.023 --> 01:58.458
I could when I was 10.

02:00.601 --> 02:01.334
Tom.

02:02.102 --> 02:03.570
I know absolutely nothing

02:03.604 --> 02:04.971
that bears on this case.

02:05.005 --> 02:06.640
How about you let me
be the judge of that?

02:06.673 --> 02:08.108
And if I knew anything, Alan,

02:10.711 --> 02:13.379
the information
wouldn't be favorable to Paul.

02:19.619 --> 02:21.421
You said yourself,

02:21.454 --> 02:23.323
"There's no way
he could have done this."

02:23.356 --> 02:24.891
I don't believe there is.

02:27.894 --> 02:29.395
Look--

02:29.429 --> 02:30.731
and this is all I'm gonna say,

02:33.233 --> 02:34.601
Brenda felt like he was becoming

02:34.635 --> 02:36.670
emotionally involved with her.

02:36.703 --> 02:38.739
It concerned her.
She talked about that.

02:41.508 --> 02:43.877
There, I've broken seal.

02:44.477 --> 02:46.179
Thank you very much.

02:46.212 --> 02:48.448
I hope you're happy.
Now, I need to go to confession.

02:49.816 --> 02:50.517
That's all?

02:50.551 --> 02:51.885
Yes.

02:52.519 --> 02:53.353
I don't believe you.

02:53.386 --> 02:54.487
TOM: Oh, for God--

02:54.521 --> 02:56.489
Come on, Tom.
Don't insult me here.

02:58.358 --> 03:00.867
This girl ended up
in some very unlikely places.

03:00.901 --> 03:03.003
You of all people know that.

03:03.870 --> 03:04.905
Meaning?

03:12.546 --> 03:13.213
Tom,

03:16.717 --> 03:18.284
was she ever with you?

03:19.753 --> 03:20.420
What?

03:21.187 --> 03:22.422
You heard me.

03:23.824 --> 03:25.659
Were you and Brenda ever--

03:25.692 --> 03:27.794
Oh, you've got to be
out of your mind.

03:31.397 --> 03:32.065
I am.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.469
Were you ever out of yours
with Brenda?

03:44.110 --> 03:46.379
I'm offering you
a little window, my friend.

03:48.148 --> 03:50.216
Whatever you share with me here,

03:50.250 --> 03:52.886
it stays confidential
between two old friends.

03:54.254 --> 03:56.590
Whatever I should turn up
on my own, however,

03:56.623 --> 03:57.791
I will use.

04:00.233 --> 04:01.535
I'm not kidding.

04:08.575 --> 04:10.511
Two old friends having a beer.

04:11.377 --> 04:13.079
Stays between us?

04:13.113 --> 04:14.380
You have my word.

04:17.551 --> 04:18.885
It happened once.

04:23.389 --> 04:24.157
When?

04:25.291 --> 04:26.292
Two years ago.

04:27.393 --> 04:29.696
She was in my office
in distress over,

04:29.730 --> 04:32.699
you know--who knows what affair
she was having.

04:32.733 --> 04:33.767
She was describing it.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.770
She, she felt demeaned

04:36.803 --> 04:38.437
by the sexual nature of it.

04:39.940 --> 04:41.542
She was...

04:41.575 --> 04:43.644
rather graphically
describing...

04:44.678 --> 04:46.813
the events,

04:46.847 --> 04:48.882
and, God help me,
I got aroused.

04:50.250 --> 04:53.153
You know, I'm not sure
I was even aware of it,

04:54.621 --> 04:56.089
but evidently she was.

05:00.767 --> 05:02.368
Then she propositioned me.

05:05.105 --> 05:08.041
I don't even know
how to respond to that.

05:08.074 --> 05:09.442
I'm shocked.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.377
I'm stunned.

05:11.411 --> 05:12.513
I'm jealous.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.414
I am a good priest.

05:16.349 --> 05:18.752
This stays between us, Alan.

05:18.785 --> 05:21.454
It has nothing to do
with this case.

05:26.727 --> 05:29.730
(music playing)

06:04.470 --> 06:05.839
SHORE:
His name is Terry Glazer.

06:05.872 --> 06:08.108
He's a professional
jury consultant. I need you to--

06:08.141 --> 06:09.776
I thought I was meeting
with a witness.

06:09.810 --> 06:11.612
You are. Mr. Glazer
will be in later.

06:11.645 --> 06:13.580
You're to drive him to Dedham,
interview people--

06:13.614 --> 06:15.649
YOUNG: Has anybody seen Tara?

06:15.682 --> 06:17.317
She's out with a client.
She'll be out all day.

06:17.918 --> 06:19.553
I need a typist today, Alan.

06:19.953 --> 06:21.087
I'm sure Jimmy can type.

06:22.122 --> 06:23.323
What did you say?

06:23.356 --> 06:24.958
Tara works for the firm, Alan,

06:24.991 --> 06:26.092
not just you.

06:26.126 --> 06:27.861
Forgive me,
but since I just brought in

06:27.894 --> 06:29.696
seven hundred
and fifty thousand dollars

06:29.730 --> 06:31.331
on top of the two million
before that,

06:31.364 --> 06:33.166
on top of the three million
before that,

06:33.199 --> 06:35.135
I think--
We all have caseloads here.

06:36.036 --> 06:37.303
I've seen your caseload, Jimmy,

06:37.337 --> 06:40.040
and, trust me, Tara
can't keep up with an ambulance.

06:40.073 --> 06:41.575
You know what?
YOUNG: Hey!

06:41.608 --> 06:43.677
SHORE: I have an important trial
starting next week.

06:43.710 --> 06:45.145
Keep that man away from me.

06:45.779 --> 06:47.447
(door opens)

06:47.881 --> 06:48.515
Hello.

06:48.549 --> 06:49.816
Catherine, this way please.

06:49.850 --> 06:51.785
CATHERINE: Wow.
From your fancy suits,

06:51.818 --> 06:52.653
I'd never have guessed

06:52.686 --> 06:54.154
you worked in such a craphole.

06:54.187 --> 06:55.088
This way.

06:56.557 --> 06:58.491
My, aren't you black?

06:59.860 --> 07:01.301
FRUTT: Hold on.

07:01.334 --> 07:03.804
She's a prosecution witness.
Why is she here?

07:03.837 --> 07:06.707
Because I care, sweetheart.

07:06.740 --> 07:08.141
SHORE: Come on, Catherine.

07:10.777 --> 07:11.945
(door opens)

07:16.049 --> 07:17.117
Thank you for coming in.

07:17.150 --> 07:18.885
CATHERINE: I'm not giving
back any of the money.

07:18.919 --> 07:20.286
I don't wanna hear
anything about money

07:20.320 --> 07:21.855
or any transaction, Catherine.

07:24.525 --> 07:26.627
This is Jamie Stringer,
my associate.

07:26.660 --> 07:28.161
Hello, dear.
STRINGER: Hi.

07:28.194 --> 07:30.096
SHORE: I want you to go over
your testimony with Jamie,

07:30.130 --> 07:32.966
every single--
That wasn't part of the deal.

07:32.999 --> 07:34.034
SHORE: There is no deal--
What deal?

07:34.067 --> 07:36.970
--Catherine.
You are a potential witness

07:37.003 --> 07:38.071
in the trial.

07:38.104 --> 07:40.140
You'll likely be called
to give testimony.

07:40.173 --> 07:41.742
We need to know exactly

07:41.775 --> 07:43.109
what the testimony will be.

07:43.143 --> 07:44.410
I'd like you to sit with Jamie--

07:44.444 --> 07:46.880
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid that's not possible.

07:46.913 --> 07:47.881
Why not?

07:49.182 --> 07:50.350
No offense, sweetheart.

07:50.383 --> 07:52.052
I'm sure you're a darling,

07:52.853 --> 07:55.088
but your mouth looks like
a drive-through window

07:55.121 --> 07:56.089
for oral sex.

07:58.024 --> 08:00.767
Uh, I'm a Christian woman.

08:00.801 --> 08:02.035
Get me another lawyer.

08:05.205 --> 08:06.206
What the hell is this?

08:06.239 --> 08:09.242
She's nuts,
but we need her.

08:09.275 --> 08:11.177
What's this deal
she's talking about?

08:12.012 --> 08:13.980
The two of us played strip
mah-jongg last night.

08:14.014 --> 08:15.081
It got rather ugly.

08:15.115 --> 08:16.182
Alan?

08:16.216 --> 08:17.918
Get her testimony,

08:17.951 --> 08:19.485
then meet
with the jury consultant,

08:19.520 --> 08:20.854
and get to Dedham.

08:24.591 --> 08:27.293
(dog barking in the distance)

08:27.327 --> 08:30.230
And according to Father Dugan,

08:30.263 --> 08:31.331
Brenda believed
that you were becoming

08:31.364 --> 08:32.265
emotionally involved,

08:32.298 --> 08:33.600
is that true?

08:33.634 --> 08:35.034
I don't know.

08:35.669 --> 08:36.469
Paul,

08:36.870 --> 08:38.071
look at me.

08:41.942 --> 08:42.909
Next week,

08:42.943 --> 08:44.911
we defend you
on murder charges.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.248
I need to ask you
personal questions,

08:48.281 --> 08:49.482
perhaps uncomfortable ones,

08:49.516 --> 08:50.784
and you need to answer them.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.222
Were you in love
with Brenda Wilbur?

09:02.803 --> 09:04.304
I believe I was...

09:04.337 --> 09:05.338
falling in love, yes.

09:06.372 --> 09:08.609
And did she indicate
her feelings towards you?

09:09.843 --> 09:12.378
She indicated that she
was only interested in sex.

09:14.781 --> 09:15.816
I'm sorry.

09:19.953 --> 09:20.954
Alan just called.

09:20.987 --> 09:22.222
He's on his way.

09:22.255 --> 09:23.456
He wants you to meet him

09:23.489 --> 09:24.858
at the courthouse.

09:25.692 --> 09:27.060
Okay.

09:36.603 --> 09:38.071
Are you in love with her?

09:39.906 --> 09:40.807
I'm sorry?

09:41.742 --> 09:43.744
Your wife,
are you in love with her?

09:45.679 --> 09:46.680
Of course I am.

09:48.114 --> 09:49.215
Paul, I keep sensing

09:49.249 --> 09:50.551
that you are looking
to present yourself

09:50.584 --> 09:51.852
in the best possible light,

09:51.885 --> 09:54.187
and that helps neither me...

09:54.220 --> 09:55.421
nor you.

10:01.301 --> 10:02.803
Are you in love
with your wife?

10:06.106 --> 10:07.107
No.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.644
Is she with you?

10:11.311 --> 10:12.312
No.

10:15.081 --> 10:17.918
We share the same commitment
to our children.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.353
We like the same movies,
same books.

10:21.755 --> 10:24.090
We're two wonderfully,
compatible people actually,

10:24.124 --> 10:26.560
just--perfect couple,

10:28.729 --> 10:30.163
just romantically dead.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.805
CLARKE: Mr. Shore is free
to review our autopsy report.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.607
There's no need--
I want to conduct my own.

10:40.641 --> 10:41.808
Why?

10:41.842 --> 10:43.910
First, because it's fun.
And, second--

10:43.944 --> 10:45.078
CLARKE: It's indecent
to the victim

10:45.111 --> 10:46.547
to be dissected
and probed again.

10:46.580 --> 10:47.548
The victim is dead.

10:47.581 --> 10:49.716
I'm sure she's got
other things on her plate.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.184
WINNAKER: Mr. Shore,

10:51.217 --> 10:52.919
we don't make fun of the dead

10:52.953 --> 10:54.020
in this courthouse.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.956
I can see why.
There's so much sport to be had

10:55.989 --> 10:57.390
with the living.

10:57.423 --> 10:59.526
Look, Your Honor,
the defense is entitled

10:59.560 --> 11:01.367
to conduct its own autopsy.

11:01.401 --> 11:03.303
I'm not looking for a favor.

11:03.336 --> 11:05.171
I'm exercising a right.

11:07.140 --> 11:10.143
Mr. Clarke, let his people
examine the body.

11:11.745 --> 11:12.913
What else we got?

11:12.946 --> 11:14.648
That's it,
Your Honor.

11:15.281 --> 11:16.149
Chambers.

11:19.986 --> 11:23.023
Okay. Let's cut to it.

11:23.890 --> 11:24.825
We--

11:26.492 --> 11:27.894
what are you doing here?

11:27.928 --> 11:29.429
This is just for lawyers.

11:29.462 --> 11:31.732
Mr. Shore is acting as my agent.
I therefore--

11:31.765 --> 11:34.267
This meeting
is for counsel only.

11:34.300 --> 11:35.602
I'm paying for it.

11:35.636 --> 11:37.504
Either show me your bar card

11:37.538 --> 11:38.905
or get the hell out of here.

11:38.939 --> 11:41.207
It's not nice to remove people,

11:41.241 --> 11:42.843
Marcus.

11:42.876 --> 11:43.777
What's the expression,

11:43.810 --> 11:46.613
"what goes around comes around"?

11:46.647 --> 11:49.349
WINNAKER: Victoria,

11:49.382 --> 11:50.416
you may run this town,

11:50.450 --> 11:53.086
but you don't run my courtroom.

11:53.119 --> 11:54.420
Either get out

11:54.454 --> 11:56.823
or I'll have you thrown
in a jail cell.

11:58.792 --> 11:59.860
I could be wrong,

11:59.893 --> 12:01.868
but I think
he wants you to leave.

12:13.747 --> 12:16.082
That woman needs to get laid.

12:17.017 --> 12:18.251
Okay. Sit.

12:25.626 --> 12:27.160
I spent all day yesterday

12:27.193 --> 12:29.630
poring over this case.

12:29.663 --> 12:30.764
Mr. Clarke,

12:30.797 --> 12:33.033
it's all circumstantial.

12:33.066 --> 12:36.069
Mr. Shore, it's clear as hell
that your guy did it.

12:37.604 --> 12:38.705
I say

12:38.739 --> 12:40.574
go voluntary manslaughter,

12:40.607 --> 12:42.408
eight years.

12:42.442 --> 12:45.311
The media can go
screw themselves.

12:45.345 --> 12:46.613
All in favor?

12:48.549 --> 12:49.816
You must be joking.

12:50.951 --> 12:52.619
Hey, Al,

12:55.155 --> 12:56.289
you haven't lived here

12:56.322 --> 12:58.324
in a long time.

12:58.358 --> 13:00.100
Why don't you go to a reunion

13:00.133 --> 13:02.035
or to hang out

13:02.068 --> 13:03.737
go shoot a few games of pool

13:03.770 --> 13:06.507
down at the pub?

13:06.540 --> 13:08.074
You know what the buzz is here

13:08.108 --> 13:10.410
in your jury pool?

13:10.443 --> 13:11.645
He's guilty.

13:13.179 --> 13:14.615
You know what, guys?
I'd like to move

13:14.648 --> 13:15.649
for a change of venue.

13:15.682 --> 13:17.283
Too late.

13:17.317 --> 13:18.318
All motions were to be filed--

13:18.351 --> 13:19.553
It's never too late.

13:21.522 --> 13:23.156
By the way, if that's the buzz
you're hearing

13:23.189 --> 13:25.425
around the checkerboard
down at the barbershop,

13:25.458 --> 13:26.893
you have a duty to remove this

13:26.927 --> 13:28.529
to another venue.

13:28.962 --> 13:30.697
I like to think

13:30.731 --> 13:33.099
my ability to run a fair trial

13:33.133 --> 13:34.400
can overcome

13:34.434 --> 13:37.337
any potential jury bias.

13:39.773 --> 13:41.207
If I were you,

13:42.776 --> 13:44.010
I'd plead.

13:44.044 --> 13:45.879
You're not.

13:45.912 --> 13:46.813
I won't.

13:48.882 --> 13:50.116
I hope counsel is looking

13:50.150 --> 13:52.252
at the evidence objectively.

13:52.285 --> 13:54.521
I never do that, Your Honor.
Do you?

13:58.191 --> 13:59.626
Get out.

13:59.660 --> 14:00.901
I want to talk to Mr. Clarke.

14:00.934 --> 14:02.368
That would be ex parte.

14:02.402 --> 14:05.238
We don't talk Latin
here in Dedham.

14:05.271 --> 14:06.740
Get the hell out of here.

14:06.773 --> 14:08.374
Perhaps I can interpret for you.

14:08.408 --> 14:10.644
I have the right
to be present at any meeting--

14:10.677 --> 14:11.978
I wanna talk fishing,

14:12.012 --> 14:13.246
and I don't want you learning

14:13.279 --> 14:15.348
my favorite holes.

14:15.381 --> 14:16.382
Out!

14:30.363 --> 14:31.832
You'd better add manslaughter

14:31.865 --> 14:33.066
to your pleadings.

14:33.634 --> 14:35.602
Manslaughter?

14:35.636 --> 14:37.971
He took a hammer
to her head 20 times.

14:38.004 --> 14:39.940
Exactly.

14:39.973 --> 14:42.375
This Shore character is smart.

14:42.843 --> 14:44.645
He might very well get up there

14:44.678 --> 14:46.780
and say whoever did this
must have been acting

14:46.813 --> 14:48.915
in the heat of passion.

14:48.949 --> 14:51.351
If the jury
doesn't have manslaughter

14:51.384 --> 14:52.853
to fall back on,

14:52.886 --> 14:55.656
they might have no choice
but to acquit.

14:55.689 --> 14:58.191
CLARKE: Judge,
Paul Stewart is well liked.

14:58.224 --> 15:00.060
If they do have manslaughter
to fall back on,

15:00.093 --> 15:01.768
they might do so
just out of sympathy.

15:01.802 --> 15:04.270
Your case is circumstantial,
Harvey.

15:05.138 --> 15:08.108
This Shore is a shrewd SOB.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.142
And you'd be smart

15:09.175 --> 15:10.977
to keep all your options open.

15:11.011 --> 15:11.778
CLARKE: (sighs)

15:19.385 --> 15:20.787
Look at her.

15:22.388 --> 15:25.391
(music playing)

15:30.363 --> 15:31.765
This isn't manslaughter.

15:43.844 --> 15:45.579
VICTORIA: He actually said that,

15:45.612 --> 15:48.314
I need to get laid?

15:48.348 --> 15:49.916
I'm keeping track
of everything he says

15:49.950 --> 15:51.885
in case we should need it
for appeal.

15:53.787 --> 15:56.056
And is that why you're here,

15:56.089 --> 15:57.624
because you agree?

15:58.625 --> 15:59.660
I'm sorry?

15:59.693 --> 16:01.668
That I need to get laid.

16:01.702 --> 16:04.137
No. That's not why I'm here.

16:04.170 --> 16:05.171
Pity.

16:06.873 --> 16:09.075
I would think your son
being on trial for murder

16:09.109 --> 16:11.812
might put a slight chill
in your libido.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.880
Crisis might lower sex drive

16:15.381 --> 16:17.050
but it also...

16:17.083 --> 16:18.852
intensifies loneliness.

16:18.885 --> 16:21.555
Oh, the passive-aggressive
"come on." Much better.

16:21.588 --> 16:22.656
Uh-hmm.

16:25.692 --> 16:27.060
The reason I'm here,

16:29.395 --> 16:30.697
I have made a mistake.

16:32.733 --> 16:33.900
It seems I should have moved

16:33.934 --> 16:35.268
for a change of venue after all.

16:35.301 --> 16:37.470
I thought Paul's popularity

16:37.504 --> 16:38.338
within the town

16:38.371 --> 16:40.006
would work in our favor.

16:40.507 --> 16:42.008
Where I miscalculated...

16:44.778 --> 16:46.246
was with the profound contempt

16:46.279 --> 16:48.248
the people of Dedham
seem to have for you.

16:50.416 --> 16:51.818
I know
this is difficult to hear,

16:51.852 --> 16:53.987
and I'm sure much of it
has to do with envy.

16:54.020 --> 16:56.923
You're a rich,
powerful woman

16:56.957 --> 16:59.125
who young boys wanna sleep with.

17:01.668 --> 17:04.204
But I need to distance you
from the defense team.

17:04.237 --> 17:05.539
You need to be
in the background,

17:05.571 --> 17:07.641
far, far in the background.

17:09.342 --> 17:11.845
I want you sitting
in the back of the courtroom.

17:11.877 --> 17:13.513
You can't be entering
and leaving with us.

17:13.547 --> 17:16.449
I can't have the jury
looking at Paul

17:16.482 --> 17:18.218
and getting so much
as a glimpse of you.

17:22.222 --> 17:22.888
Hey,

17:25.726 --> 17:27.393
you're a wonderful woman.

17:30.163 --> 17:32.365
And I like being the only one
who knows it.

17:34.768 --> 17:35.769
Well...

17:46.680 --> 17:48.615
Ugh, my feet are killing me.

17:49.516 --> 17:50.751
You're just getting back?

17:50.784 --> 17:52.719
It's 10:00.
Yes.

17:52.753 --> 17:54.888
What are you guys
still doing here?

17:54.921 --> 17:57.090
I have my motion
to compel tomorrow,

17:57.123 --> 17:58.158
remember?

17:58.191 --> 17:59.926
You're gonna help me
with that research?

17:59.960 --> 18:01.234
Well, I'm sorry, Jimmy,

18:01.267 --> 18:03.069
but I've been hoofing it
all over Dedham

18:03.103 --> 18:04.470
with a jury consultant,

18:04.505 --> 18:05.639
interviewing--
You see?

18:05.672 --> 18:06.540
All right. Let's just--

18:06.573 --> 18:07.674
It's not all right.

18:08.308 --> 18:10.210
The guy is monopolizing
associates

18:10.243 --> 18:11.111
like he's a partner,

18:11.144 --> 18:12.979
which he isn't, and I am.

18:13.013 --> 18:14.981
Jimmy, he's about to start
a new trial.

18:15.015 --> 18:16.416
We all have trials, Ellenor.

18:16.449 --> 18:17.718
I'm sick of this.

18:17.751 --> 18:19.085
And I'm also sick of you

18:19.119 --> 18:20.554
making excuses for the guy.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.829
(door opens)

18:28.862 --> 18:30.263
(door slams)

18:30.296 --> 18:32.098
Good day at the office?

18:32.132 --> 18:33.066
How's it going?

18:33.534 --> 18:35.301
Our expert jury consultant

18:35.335 --> 18:36.870
has deep concerns.

18:36.903 --> 18:38.171
FRUTT: Yeah? Well,
if anyone can pull it out,

18:38.204 --> 18:39.540
Alan's the guy.

18:40.907 --> 18:41.908
Ellenor, uh...

18:45.679 --> 18:46.346
never mind.

18:47.581 --> 18:48.582
What?

18:54.287 --> 18:55.488
I think I got a peek

18:55.522 --> 18:57.758
at how Alan pulls things out.

18:59.960 --> 19:01.167
What do you mean?

19:04.270 --> 19:05.839
Jamie,

19:05.872 --> 19:07.508
finish what you started to say.

19:11.745 --> 19:13.747
Well, I think--

19:13.780 --> 19:15.148
and I can't be sure,

19:15.181 --> 19:17.450
but I think Catherine Piper,

19:17.483 --> 19:19.019
that wacky prosecution witness

19:19.052 --> 19:20.086
that was in this morning,

19:20.120 --> 19:21.622
I think she's being paid

19:21.655 --> 19:23.156
to modify her testimony.

19:24.925 --> 19:25.859
I beg your pardon?

19:25.892 --> 19:27.193
There was all this cryptic talk

19:27.227 --> 19:29.129
about a transaction or a deal,

19:29.162 --> 19:31.131
and Alan tried to shut
the conversation down

19:31.164 --> 19:32.733
like he didn't want me
to hear it.

19:32.766 --> 19:34.735
And, again,
I can't be positive,

19:35.669 --> 19:37.103
but I think...

19:37.137 --> 19:39.272
this fruitcake
is being paid off.

19:43.644 --> 19:45.178
WILSON: We've had this
discussion already,

19:45.211 --> 19:46.446
I don't care.
PAUL: Wendy.

19:46.479 --> 19:47.180
Shut up, Paul.

19:47.213 --> 19:48.248
PAUL: Where are the kids?

19:48.281 --> 19:50.016
With my mother,
where I will be shortly,

19:50.050 --> 19:51.317
unless you'd like to run off
after yours.

19:51.351 --> 19:53.754
Uh, listen--
This doesn't concern you.

19:53.787 --> 19:55.722
If you leave now,
you'll be indicting him

19:55.756 --> 19:57.791
with the jury pool.
I don't care.

19:57.824 --> 19:59.292
What is going on?
What suddenly changed

19:59.325 --> 20:00.734
in the last few hours?

20:00.767 --> 20:02.603
What's changed, Paul,

20:02.636 --> 20:05.338
is you loved her.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.808
She wasn't just some--

20:07.841 --> 20:10.577
you loved her.

20:10.611 --> 20:13.146
And I can't wake up
in this house with you,

20:13.179 --> 20:15.415
and I can't even pretend
to be on your side.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.283
Where is all this hurt
coming from?

20:17.317 --> 20:18.585
It's not like you've loved me.

20:18.619 --> 20:19.720
What is this about?

20:19.753 --> 20:21.622
I won't be your damn trial prop.

20:21.655 --> 20:23.824
I won't walk into court
as the loyal wife.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.693
(sobbing)

20:30.430 --> 20:31.932
Good luck.

20:31.965 --> 20:33.166
Goodbye.

20:52.452 --> 20:53.754
SHORE: Tom.
(gasps)

20:53.787 --> 20:55.889
(sighs)

20:55.922 --> 20:57.891
Good lord, Alan, you scared me.

20:58.559 --> 21:00.266
What the hell are you doing
sitting there like that?

21:01.768 --> 21:03.069
SHORE: Tom, what we talked

21:03.103 --> 21:05.205
about as friends over drinks,

21:06.840 --> 21:08.041
you and Brenda,

21:10.577 --> 21:12.278
I'd like your permission
to use it.

21:13.714 --> 21:16.617
What? Use it how?

21:16.650 --> 21:18.919
It doesn't bear directly
on this case.

21:18.952 --> 21:20.420
You gave me your word
that you wouldn't.

21:20.453 --> 21:22.022
And I'll stick to my word.

21:24.057 --> 21:25.792
I won't do anything
without your permission,

21:25.826 --> 21:27.327
but please hear me out.

21:30.263 --> 21:32.533
The way Brenda
propositioned you,

21:32.566 --> 21:34.267
it is extremely relevant

21:34.300 --> 21:37.237
to establish
her sexual aggressiveness.

21:37.270 --> 21:40.240
The idea that she could have
brought somebody home,

21:40.273 --> 21:43.243
perhaps a stranger,
even, who then killed her,

21:43.276 --> 21:45.478
that's a real possibility.

21:45.512 --> 21:47.914
One I need to be able
to convince a jury of.

21:50.250 --> 21:51.552
The fact that she came on
to a priest is--

21:51.585 --> 21:52.619
No.

21:53.587 --> 21:56.222
Tom.
No.

21:56.256 --> 21:58.124
No. It would destroy me,

21:58.158 --> 21:59.726
my parish.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.568
No.

22:01.602 --> 22:04.137
Not to mention
it's completely extraneous.

22:04.170 --> 22:07.240
You just--you, you look
desperate, for God's sake.

22:07.273 --> 22:09.309
I'm afraid I'm feeling
a little desperate.

22:13.213 --> 22:14.548
I'll honor my word.

22:16.382 --> 22:19.485
I won't reveal your secret
unless you allow me to,

22:19.520 --> 22:22.656
but, please,
please, think about it.

22:31.031 --> 22:32.465
I've been subpoenaed...

22:36.269 --> 22:37.704
by the prosecution.

22:39.540 --> 22:40.507
Why?

22:41.842 --> 22:43.777
He came here the night
of the murder.

22:45.078 --> 22:46.146
Paul?
TOM: Yeah.

22:46.179 --> 22:49.415
He said that he needed
to confess,

22:50.116 --> 22:51.284
and he panicked.

22:51.317 --> 22:53.053
I--I think because
he heard other people.

22:53.086 --> 22:56.089
He--he fled before he went
into the confessional.

22:56.590 --> 22:58.358
Why did you not tell me this?

22:59.225 --> 23:00.801
Because I felt
it was private,

23:00.834 --> 23:03.737
between a parishioner
and his priest.

23:04.671 --> 23:06.640
So why are you telling
me now?

23:09.342 --> 23:11.878
Because someone
on the cleaning crew

23:11.912 --> 23:14.581
evidently overheard it
and reported it to the police.

23:18.284 --> 23:20.153
It's not private anymore.

23:30.163 --> 23:31.197
I went to confession

23:31.231 --> 23:32.933
because I had just seen
a dead body.

23:32.966 --> 23:34.935
I didn't call the cops or--

23:36.302 --> 23:37.437
plus the affair.

23:37.470 --> 23:39.072
I was in shock, in crisis.

23:39.105 --> 23:40.707
I needed to speak
with my priest.

23:40.741 --> 23:42.442
I didn't go
to confess murder.

23:42.475 --> 23:44.845
I understand, but this
doesn't look good, Paul.

23:44.878 --> 23:46.847
You were seen leaving
the victim's house,

23:46.880 --> 23:48.782
then seen minutes later
rushing to a priest,

23:48.815 --> 23:50.350
ostensibly to confess.

23:50.383 --> 23:52.653
They have no witnesses
to my leaving the house.

23:52.686 --> 23:53.920
You hope.

23:55.722 --> 23:57.023
Where's Wendy now?

23:57.057 --> 23:58.191
She's still at her mother's.

23:58.224 --> 23:59.425
You have to get her back.

23:59.459 --> 24:00.333
She's not coming.

24:00.366 --> 24:01.668
Keep trying.

24:03.670 --> 24:05.105
I want her in the courtroom.

24:08.374 --> 24:09.810
I'm going back
to the office to meet

24:09.843 --> 24:10.677
with the jury consultant.

24:10.711 --> 24:12.145
Voir dire starts after lunch.

24:12.178 --> 24:13.647
I want you there for that.

24:15.081 --> 24:16.149
Okay.

24:17.150 --> 24:18.384
You okay?

24:18.418 --> 24:21.922
(sighs) I don't know.

24:30.163 --> 24:31.297
I'll stay with him.

24:44.978 --> 24:46.412
Whatever you're feeling...

24:48.248 --> 24:50.717
your public face
has to remain stoic.

24:51.952 --> 24:53.386
Photographers
will be snapping pictures.

24:53.419 --> 24:55.455
Any likeness of you
in the newspaper

24:55.488 --> 24:58.559
must be that
of an innocent man.

25:00.060 --> 25:01.301
I miss her.

25:03.036 --> 25:05.105
Of all the times not
to be able to talk to her.

25:06.372 --> 25:07.974
We'll try to get her back.

25:09.876 --> 25:11.177
Get her back?

25:13.580 --> 25:15.015
She's dead, Tara.

25:15.782 --> 25:17.751
I can't talk about
that in public, can I?

25:18.719 --> 25:20.120
I can't let
the potential jury pool

25:20.153 --> 25:21.487
see how much I loved her.

25:21.522 --> 25:25.158
I can't let people
see me grieve because...

25:33.600 --> 25:34.735
I'm sorry.

25:37.203 --> 25:40.073
I'm sorry. I just--
It's okay.

25:40.106 --> 25:41.875
No, I don't--I
don't mean to.

25:41.908 --> 25:43.109
I apologize.

25:45.812 --> 25:48.715
Paul...

25:48.749 --> 25:50.383
somebody you love has died.

25:54.354 --> 25:55.789
You're allowed to grieve.

26:05.606 --> 26:07.674
An older, black woman,

26:07.708 --> 26:09.810
that's your ideal juror.

26:09.843 --> 26:11.244
Somebody
with life experience.

26:11.277 --> 26:13.313
Somebody who understands
that infidelity

26:13.346 --> 26:15.015
doesn't mean murder.

26:15.048 --> 26:16.883
And if there's any
minority at all,

26:16.917 --> 26:17.884
grab him or her.

26:17.918 --> 26:20.020
Minorities are your best
chance for a hung jury.

26:20.053 --> 26:21.622
I can show you
the statistics.

26:21.655 --> 26:22.488
Never mind what I want.

26:22.523 --> 26:24.090
Tell me what we figure
to get.

26:26.593 --> 26:28.461
Middle-aged white males

26:28.494 --> 26:29.763
who never went to college.

26:29.796 --> 26:32.799
Blue-collar men vote
to convict 98% of the time.

26:32.833 --> 26:34.601
Great.
STRINGER: It's worse.

26:34.635 --> 26:36.903
Blue collars
statistically resent rich,

26:36.937 --> 26:38.204
they resent doctors,

26:38.238 --> 26:39.640
and here's one you'll like,

26:39.673 --> 26:42.008
they resent rich men
with mistresses.

26:42.042 --> 26:44.444
We're defending
a Triple Crown winner.

26:44.477 --> 26:45.846
You need to pray
that there's at least

26:45.879 --> 26:47.648
one black woman in that pool.

26:47.681 --> 26:49.916
I have a series of litmus
questions for you,

26:49.950 --> 26:52.619
but basically
you want black female,

26:52.653 --> 26:55.856
black female, black female.

26:55.889 --> 26:57.357
Am I being too subtle?

27:00.734 --> 27:02.703
MAN: George Bush is a great man.

27:02.736 --> 27:04.270
SHORE: Because?

27:04.304 --> 27:06.873
MAN: Because he's president
of the United States.

27:06.907 --> 27:08.208
You don't get to be president

27:08.241 --> 27:09.976
without a measure of greatness.

27:10.010 --> 27:11.211
SHORE: Bill Clinton.

27:12.513 --> 27:14.414
What about Bill Clinton, sir?

27:17.083 --> 27:18.084
He's okay.

27:18.118 --> 27:19.319
Okay?

27:19.352 --> 27:21.588
What happened to
"you don't get to be president

27:21.622 --> 27:23.023
without a measure
of greatness?"

27:23.056 --> 27:25.391
MAN: Mr. Clinton is brilliant,

27:25.425 --> 27:28.194
he is an excellent politician,

27:28.228 --> 27:30.363
but he committed infidelity.

27:30.897 --> 27:33.499
I can't respect
any person who does that.

27:33.534 --> 27:36.169
Your Honor, I move that this
juror be excused for cause.

27:36.202 --> 27:36.937
Objection.

27:36.970 --> 27:38.438
I'm not removing him.

27:38.471 --> 27:40.507
Your Honor, my client
was unfaithful to his wife.

27:40.541 --> 27:42.342
Clearly--
I'm not removing

27:42.375 --> 27:46.680
every juror who can't
respect infidelity.

27:46.713 --> 27:48.114
We'd have nobody left.

27:50.984 --> 27:53.754
Defense exercises one
of its peremptory challenges.

27:54.788 --> 27:55.522
Thank you, sir.

27:55.556 --> 27:56.923
You are excused.

27:56.957 --> 27:58.058
What?

27:58.091 --> 28:01.702
WINNAKER:
Sir, please leave the room now.

28:01.735 --> 28:02.803
Fine.

28:03.604 --> 28:05.972
As far as I go,
infidelity should be a crime.

28:06.006 --> 28:07.574
Put him in jail.

28:07.608 --> 28:08.942
(clapping)

28:08.975 --> 28:10.376
I hear you.

28:10.410 --> 28:11.545
Yes, I do.

28:11.578 --> 28:13.213
Yes, I do.

28:22.455 --> 28:23.456
What is up with you?

28:23.489 --> 28:25.325
What are you even doing here?

28:25.358 --> 28:27.728
CATHERINE: Well, I came
to watch you in voir dire.

28:27.761 --> 28:29.462
See how you relate
to the jurors.

28:29.495 --> 28:30.731
You aren't allowed in there.

28:30.764 --> 28:32.165
You're a witness, Catherine.

28:32.198 --> 28:33.600
Oh, that's right.

28:33.634 --> 28:35.636
Uh, that must be
why I'm here.

28:35.669 --> 28:37.003
I'm a witness.

28:38.739 --> 28:41.441
I need another $50,000.

28:41.474 --> 28:43.476
Actually, that's a lie.

28:43.510 --> 28:45.045
I don't need it.

28:45.078 --> 28:46.780
I just want it.

28:47.380 --> 28:49.282
First, if it's for all
the elective surgeries,

28:49.315 --> 28:50.717
you do need it.

28:50.751 --> 28:52.285
And, second, $50,000

28:52.318 --> 28:53.820
won't nearly get the job done.

28:53.854 --> 28:55.421
The answer's no.

28:55.455 --> 28:57.357
I want the check
by tomorrow.

28:57.390 --> 28:59.893
Tell Victoria
I feel an attack

28:59.926 --> 29:01.467
of conscience coming on.

29:01.501 --> 29:02.268
Your conscience?

29:02.302 --> 29:03.537
That's a pinprick.

29:03.570 --> 29:04.538
Alan.

29:04.571 --> 29:05.539
Catherine.

29:05.572 --> 29:06.372
Alan.

29:06.406 --> 29:07.608
Catherine.

29:09.209 --> 29:12.245
This give and take is a little
like tennis, isn't it?

29:12.278 --> 29:15.516
You know, the game with
the racket and the balls?

29:17.584 --> 29:21.254
Actually, I've got your balls,
haven't I, dear?

29:22.455 --> 29:25.025
And if you don't want me
making a racket,

29:25.058 --> 29:26.893
you'll tell Victoria
to get me that

29:26.927 --> 29:28.762
extra fifty by tomorrow.

29:33.734 --> 29:35.702
(door opens)

29:35.736 --> 29:37.037
(door closes)

29:37.070 --> 29:38.539
KEVIN: We've proceeded
to trial quickly,

29:38.572 --> 29:41.174
frankly, because it was
a simple investigation.

29:41.207 --> 29:42.943
The guy was caught.

29:42.976 --> 29:44.611
He was seen leaving
the house.

29:44.645 --> 29:47.213
He left his prints, hair,
and fibers in the house.

29:47.247 --> 29:48.849
The question I'd ask

29:48.882 --> 29:51.051
is why did the defense
agree to a quick trial?

29:51.084 --> 29:53.353
And I suspect
the answer is

29:53.386 --> 29:54.387
because they're trying
to trade

29:54.420 --> 29:57.023
on the doctor's reputation
before it's shot.

29:57.057 --> 29:57.891
Hello, Detective.

29:57.924 --> 29:59.926
Nice to see you talking
to a reporter,

29:59.960 --> 30:01.535
commenting on the evidence.

30:01.568 --> 30:02.869
Be sure to get
that spelling right.

30:02.903 --> 30:06.640
It's M-C,
capital C-A-R-L-E-Y.

30:06.673 --> 30:07.641
Excuse us.

30:10.376 --> 30:12.846
See, Kev, the idea
from your side

30:12.879 --> 30:15.448
is not to give defense
any grounds for appeal,

30:15.481 --> 30:17.751
talking to the press,
contaminating jury pools,

30:17.784 --> 30:18.852
that kind of thing.

30:18.885 --> 30:21.154
State of mind is no excuse,
by the way.

30:21.187 --> 30:22.723
You can't plead stupidity.

30:24.891 --> 30:26.392
Thoughts?

30:27.528 --> 30:30.330
The reason this is being
tried here in Dedham

30:30.363 --> 30:32.498
is because you didn't move it
when you had the chance.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.468
You didn't wanna move it
because you wanted

30:35.501 --> 30:36.937
to come back here
and put on a big show

30:36.970 --> 30:39.806
in your hometown,
and now it's backfiring.

30:40.807 --> 30:42.208
You're not even
a criminal attorney.

30:42.242 --> 30:45.078
Your specialty is antitrust.

30:45.111 --> 30:48.214
Oh, you're here to help out
your friend, aren't you?

30:51.585 --> 30:53.053
You're a fraud.

30:53.086 --> 30:57.090
(music playing)

31:10.076 --> 31:11.912
Norfolk county's
a little rigid.

31:11.945 --> 31:13.413
You can't change venue?

31:14.180 --> 31:15.481
Apparently not.

31:15.516 --> 31:17.050
And some of our witnesses...

31:18.752 --> 31:20.286
make us uneasy.

31:20.320 --> 31:22.322
Which witnesses?

31:22.355 --> 31:23.524
Catherine Piper?

31:27.828 --> 31:28.762
Let's do this.

31:32.766 --> 31:33.734
FRUTT: Alan...

31:37.738 --> 31:39.105
can we see you a second?

31:50.183 --> 31:52.185
Jamie evidently heard
an exchange between

31:52.218 --> 31:53.887
you and Catherine Piper,

31:53.920 --> 31:55.656
which led her to conclude
that this witness

31:55.689 --> 31:56.422
may have been bought.

31:56.456 --> 31:57.658
Do you know
anything about that?

31:59.025 --> 32:00.601
And why would Jamie
think that?

32:00.634 --> 32:02.736
You'd have to ask Jamie,
Eugene.

32:02.769 --> 32:03.904
FRUTT: I did.

32:04.337 --> 32:06.740
She heard the witness
talking about a deal,

32:06.773 --> 32:08.642
a transaction,
and then she heard you

32:08.675 --> 32:10.210
shut the discussion down.

32:11.945 --> 32:13.647
What's going on, Alan?

32:13.680 --> 32:15.248
And don't lie to us.

32:19.185 --> 32:20.587
It appears that
my client's mother

32:20.621 --> 32:22.022
may have bribed Ms. Piper.

32:23.557 --> 32:25.258
I wasn't present for it.
I don't know.

32:25.291 --> 32:26.527
I don't want to know.

32:26.560 --> 32:28.629
That's why I
instructed Ms. Piper

32:28.662 --> 32:30.831
to tell me nothing
about whatever deal

32:30.864 --> 32:31.832
they may have entered into.

32:31.865 --> 32:33.399
Well, it seems like
you have enough

32:33.433 --> 32:34.367
to go to the judge.

32:34.400 --> 32:36.903
I don't, and I won't.

32:37.303 --> 32:38.438
YOUNG: You won't?

32:38.471 --> 32:40.473
Look, listen to me, Alan.

32:40.507 --> 32:42.776
I'll take a pass on that.
Thank you.

32:43.644 --> 32:45.779
I've done nothing
but listen to you

32:45.812 --> 32:47.514
since I walked through the door

32:47.548 --> 32:49.149
and, frankly, Eugene,

32:49.182 --> 32:50.551
I'm tired of listening to you.

32:50.584 --> 32:51.718
You're not that interesting.

32:51.752 --> 32:53.153
Let's make a little deal.

32:54.154 --> 32:55.488
Until this trial is over,

32:55.522 --> 32:56.790
I'll keep completely out
of your way.

32:56.823 --> 32:58.692
You stay the hell out of mine.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.168
(door closes)

33:02.903 --> 33:04.004
He's gone.

33:05.539 --> 33:08.542
Eugene, obviously
he's feeling a lot of stress.

33:08.575 --> 33:11.411
This is one of his oldest
friends on trial here.

33:11.444 --> 33:14.180
Ellenor,
when this trial is over,

33:14.214 --> 33:15.616
that man is gone.

33:19.853 --> 33:21.354
(door opens)

33:26.593 --> 33:28.261
STRINGER: I'm not good
with dead bodies, Alan.

33:28.294 --> 33:29.495
Just see what the problem is.

33:29.530 --> 33:30.764
Oh, what about Tara?

33:30.797 --> 33:32.833
Tara loves dead bodies.
It's worrisome.

33:32.866 --> 33:34.935
I'm serious.
Death makes me nauseous.

33:34.968 --> 33:36.770
SHORE: Gee, and it
so tickles the rest of us.

33:36.803 --> 33:38.639
Tara's busy interviewing
witnesses.

33:38.672 --> 33:39.706
I need to go see Paul,

33:39.740 --> 33:40.907
who's on the verge
of a breakdown.

33:40.941 --> 33:43.043
I need you to meet
with the medical examiner.

33:43.076 --> 33:44.878
So, please, just do it.

33:49.482 --> 33:50.250
Hello.

33:51.384 --> 33:52.553
Where is he?

33:52.586 --> 33:54.387
In his tree house.

33:54.420 --> 33:55.522
Believe that?

33:56.022 --> 33:56.723
His tree house?

33:56.757 --> 33:57.691
The one that he and I--

33:57.724 --> 33:59.192
It's still standing.

33:59.225 --> 34:02.102
You two swung a pretty
good hammer back then.

34:02.135 --> 34:03.804
I suppose
I shouldn't say that.

34:11.043 --> 34:13.413
(wood creaks)

34:13.446 --> 34:15.616
SHORE: George Scott
whiffs inning over.

34:15.649 --> 34:16.783
Wasn't that our password?

34:17.884 --> 34:18.784
Enter.

34:19.284 --> 34:21.688
I can't believe this thing
is still standing.

34:21.722 --> 34:23.556
PAUL: It's been renamed,

34:23.590 --> 34:24.925
home for bad husbands.

34:24.958 --> 34:26.492
(chuckles)

34:26.527 --> 34:28.360
PAUL: I can't tell you how
many times after fights

34:28.393 --> 34:30.163
with Wendy,
I'd come up here to sit.

34:30.831 --> 34:32.632
Remember all our
secret compartments

34:32.666 --> 34:36.168
to hide the beer,
cigarettes, and pot?

34:36.202 --> 34:38.071
PAUL: Well, I found some
of the old pot a few years ago,

34:38.103 --> 34:38.839
by the way.

34:38.871 --> 34:40.306
Smoke it?

34:40.340 --> 34:41.373
Is there any left?

34:44.978 --> 34:46.179
What's going on?

34:49.081 --> 34:50.416
I don't know
if I can make it, Alan.

34:50.449 --> 34:51.851
This is--
You'll make it.

34:55.355 --> 34:58.859
Tara tell you how
much I miss her, Brenda?

34:58.892 --> 35:00.166
No, she didn't.

35:02.636 --> 35:05.772
I have so much
to be humiliated about,

35:05.806 --> 35:08.441
but being ridiculously
in love with someone...

35:09.843 --> 35:11.612
who didn't love me back.

35:11.645 --> 35:13.313
That's always a good one.

35:18.151 --> 35:19.620
Am I gonna beat this?

35:22.656 --> 35:23.790
I don't know.

35:27.127 --> 35:28.895
The case is circumstantial.

35:28.929 --> 35:30.597
They don't have a murder weapon.

35:32.065 --> 35:33.166
They--

35:39.606 --> 35:40.941
I don't know.

35:47.247 --> 35:48.248
PAUL: I'll make a deal.

35:49.349 --> 35:51.417
Get me an acquittal,
I'll meet you back here after,

35:51.451 --> 35:52.619
and I'll bring the beer.

35:52.653 --> 35:53.787
Bring a lot.

35:56.256 --> 35:57.858
The DA wants to meet with me.

35:57.891 --> 35:59.960
I think he plans
to offer murder two.

36:01.401 --> 36:02.969
I assume...

36:04.505 --> 36:06.339
you wouldn't want
to accept that.

36:09.275 --> 36:11.377
This feels like a test.

36:11.411 --> 36:12.946
It isn't.

36:15.916 --> 36:18.985
I won't accept murder two.

36:36.903 --> 36:37.838
Don't need this crap.

36:37.871 --> 36:39.172
Came all the way
from New Haven.

36:39.205 --> 36:40.040
What exactly is the problem?

36:40.073 --> 36:41.542
Oh, you'll see exactly
the problem.

36:41.575 --> 36:43.677
Look, I don't actually have
to see the body, okay?

36:43.710 --> 36:44.745
You can just tell me.

36:44.778 --> 36:45.846
DOCTOR:
Words don't tell story.

36:45.879 --> 36:47.748
You need to see.

36:47.781 --> 36:48.815
Wonderful.

36:48.849 --> 36:52.586
Report says, "35-year-old
attractive woman,

36:52.619 --> 36:54.688
beaten to death with hammer."

37:00.934 --> 37:03.703
Not beaten, not attractive,

37:03.737 --> 37:04.804
not woman.

37:04.838 --> 37:06.339
What the hell?

37:06.372 --> 37:09.776
DOCTOR:
This is not Brenda Wilbur.

37:09.809 --> 37:11.745
You destroyed her?

37:11.778 --> 37:14.047
Evidently, she was mistakenly
ID'd as a transient.

37:14.080 --> 37:17.450
And our normal procedure
post-autopsy--

37:17.483 --> 37:20.020
look, we screwed up.
You think?

37:20.053 --> 37:21.054
Technically,
you need to file a motion

37:21.087 --> 37:22.055
to preserve the remains.

37:22.088 --> 37:23.023
You didn't do that.

37:23.056 --> 37:23.757
It's evidence.

37:23.790 --> 37:25.826
I hardly need file a motion.

37:25.859 --> 37:27.293
"Don't destroy evidence"?

37:27.327 --> 37:29.062
CLARKE: Our autopsy
was complete, so even if we--

37:29.095 --> 37:30.430
Hold on.

37:30.463 --> 37:33.466
I need to ask the obvious
question however delicate.

37:33.499 --> 37:35.869
Did he take the body home
with him to, you know--

37:35.902 --> 37:37.704
Hey, bite me.
Kevin.

37:37.738 --> 37:38.639
I've had it with this ass.

37:38.672 --> 37:39.973
He's enjoying this.

37:40.006 --> 37:42.108
He's been smug since
5th grade, and I'm sick of it.

37:42.142 --> 37:44.110
All right.
I'd like to respond to that.

37:44.144 --> 37:45.979
First, yes,
I am enjoying it.

37:46.012 --> 37:47.347
I can't wait to tell
the jury

37:47.380 --> 37:50.050
you accidentally
destroyed the corpse.

37:50.083 --> 37:52.352
Second, I believe
I was quite humble

37:52.385 --> 37:53.954
your 3rd year of 5th grade.

37:53.987 --> 37:55.689
You know what?
Just be quiet.

37:56.657 --> 37:59.560
Look, as I said, you'll get
the relevant tissues

37:59.593 --> 38:01.334
and fluids plus the reports.

38:01.367 --> 38:02.536
You won't be prejudiced.

38:03.870 --> 38:05.506
Now, can we discuss a plea?

38:05.539 --> 38:07.674
There isn't going
to be a plea.

38:07.708 --> 38:10.143
You're making a mistake.

38:10.176 --> 38:11.678
You have a little booger.

38:13.113 --> 38:17.017
Alan, you can't really wanna
try this case.

38:17.050 --> 38:18.384
Oh, but I can.

38:18.852 --> 38:20.554
(phone rings)

38:21.588 --> 38:22.589
Excuse me.

38:22.623 --> 38:23.924
Hello?

38:25.058 --> 38:26.326
I'll be right there.

38:27.327 --> 38:28.829
There's a sale.

38:33.867 --> 38:35.068
I did tell the police.

38:35.101 --> 38:37.370
They think I got the wrong
house or something.

38:37.403 --> 38:38.438
SHORE: How old was the woman?

38:38.471 --> 38:40.674
I couldn't really tell.
She was all bundled up.

38:40.707 --> 38:43.176
You're sure she came out
of Brenda Wilbur's house?

38:43.209 --> 38:45.546
90% sure
it was her house, yeah.

38:45.579 --> 38:46.747
At 7:00?

38:46.780 --> 38:47.948
Around then.

38:47.981 --> 38:50.016
Could you see
her face at all?

38:50.050 --> 38:52.352
No. No. She was all
bundled up and stuff.

38:52.385 --> 38:54.988
The reason I remember
is there was no car out front,

38:55.021 --> 38:56.857
which made me think
she was going for a walk

38:56.890 --> 38:59.059
or something,
which was strange,

38:59.092 --> 39:01.234
because it was colder
than a witch's--

39:03.203 --> 39:03.870
I'm sorry.

39:03.904 --> 39:05.138
That's all right.

39:05.171 --> 39:06.807
I'm actually not a witch.

39:07.708 --> 39:08.842
SHORE: Excuse us.

39:08.875 --> 39:11.011
Look, get the best
description you can,

39:11.044 --> 39:11.912
clothes, everything,

39:11.945 --> 39:13.313
then get over
to be with Paul.

39:13.346 --> 39:14.414
I'm worried
about him being alone.

39:14.447 --> 39:16.517
I'd go myself, but according
to our jury consultant,

39:16.550 --> 39:19.052
we have another emergency.

39:19.085 --> 39:20.386
What?

39:20.420 --> 39:21.755
You.

39:21.788 --> 39:22.956
Me?

39:22.989 --> 39:24.725
GLAZER: I interviewed people
from the jury pool.

39:24.758 --> 39:27.594
You went over like lead.

39:27.628 --> 39:30.564
Too urban, too slick,
too smart.

39:30.597 --> 39:32.132
Too smart?

39:32.165 --> 39:34.167
This is a blue-collar,
uneducated,

39:34.200 --> 39:36.302
overweight,
lunch-bucket town.

39:36.336 --> 39:38.605
You're a smooth,
Harvard-type sophisticate.

39:38.639 --> 39:39.773
And they don't like you.

39:40.440 --> 39:43.209
You need to find
a Joe Schmoe fat, Catholic,

39:43.243 --> 39:45.278
and put him at your table.

39:48.148 --> 39:49.816
What did you just say to me?

39:49.850 --> 39:52.185
I asked you to be part
of my team, Jimmy.

39:52.719 --> 39:54.087
What's going on?

39:54.120 --> 39:55.021
Nothing's going on.

39:55.055 --> 39:56.089
I need you.

39:56.890 --> 39:58.358
He's setting me up
for something.

39:58.391 --> 40:00.133
No, I'm not.
Look, you can't have him.

40:00.166 --> 40:00.867
You already got Jamie.

40:00.901 --> 40:01.935
I'll return Jamie.

40:01.968 --> 40:03.770
I need Jimmy.

40:04.571 --> 40:05.238
YOUNG: Really?

40:06.573 --> 40:08.842
So I'm gonna ask the same
question he did.

40:08.875 --> 40:09.943
What's going on?

40:09.976 --> 40:12.245
What's going on is I think
Jimmy could be an asset.

40:12.278 --> 40:14.648
Look, put it on the table
or you don't get him.

40:17.483 --> 40:18.919
Dedham is very blue-collar.

40:18.952 --> 40:21.487
The jury consultant thinks
I will alienate the jury

40:21.522 --> 40:24.290
because I'm well-dressed
and look like

40:24.324 --> 40:27.160
I read, and, well,
Jimmy doesn't.

40:27.193 --> 40:28.261
That's it!

40:28.294 --> 40:29.429
FRUTT: Hey, get off him!

40:29.462 --> 40:30.096
YOUNG: Hey!

40:30.130 --> 40:30.797
Get off me!

40:31.331 --> 40:32.666
FRUTT: Alan, get back!

40:32.699 --> 40:34.267
Jimmy!

40:34.300 --> 40:35.636
What the hell's wrong
with you?

40:35.669 --> 40:37.003
What the hell is this place?

40:39.439 --> 40:42.442
You all go to great lengths
to establish a team philosophy

40:42.475 --> 40:44.277
that we'll all jump
in together when need be.

40:44.310 --> 40:45.779
I need him!

40:48.481 --> 40:50.250
I need you!

40:52.686 --> 40:54.420
You once billed yourself
as "Jimmy the Grunt"

40:54.454 --> 40:55.989
for your own personal gain.

40:56.022 --> 40:59.359
Well, I need you to sit
your fat ass at my table

40:59.392 --> 41:01.101
and send
that same message again,

41:01.134 --> 41:03.970
not for me, not for you,
for the client,

41:04.004 --> 41:05.105
the client...

41:06.707 --> 41:08.374
who happens to be innocent.

41:30.631 --> 41:33.734
So how can I help you?

41:33.767 --> 41:36.537
Well, I come to you

41:36.570 --> 41:38.672
with a very heavy heart.

41:39.906 --> 41:42.442
I've been to my pastor but...

41:42.475 --> 41:44.711
I'm afraid I can only--

41:46.112 --> 41:49.082
well, may I sit?

41:49.983 --> 41:50.917
Sure.

41:54.187 --> 41:56.990
There's no easy way
to say this.

41:59.159 --> 42:01.935
I saw Paul Stewart
leave Brenda Wilbur's house

42:01.968 --> 42:04.571
around 10:30 the night
of the murder.

42:06.106 --> 42:07.908
Excuse me.

42:07.941 --> 42:09.375
Did you say 10:30?

42:09.409 --> 42:12.646
Paul's mother paid me
$600,000

42:12.679 --> 42:14.114
not to come forward.

42:15.782 --> 42:18.118
I'm ashamed to say
I accepted.

42:18.151 --> 42:21.087
But my conscience
just won't allow me

42:21.121 --> 42:22.355
to go down this path.

42:22.723 --> 42:25.726
I simply have to tell
the truth.

42:25.759 --> 42:27.093
He was there.

42:27.127 --> 42:29.763
I saw him.

42:29.796 --> 42:33.333
It pains me to say it,

42:33.366 --> 42:35.836
but I have no doubt

42:35.869 --> 42:37.971
he killed that woman.

42:57.624 --> 43:01.635
(music playing)

43:23.524 --> 43:25.158
WOMAN: You stinker!

43:25.191 --> 43:28.094
(music playing)
