00:03.291 --> 00:05.083
♪ OHHH OHHH OHHH ♪

00:07.625 --> 00:11.041
(tango music playing)

00:43.250 --> 00:45.041
(inhales sharply)

00:45.083 --> 00:48.333
(people speaking indistinctly)

00:48.375 --> 00:50.417
(grunts)

00:50.458 --> 00:52.041

00:52.083 --> 00:55.834
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

00:58.083 --> 01:00.792

01:00.834 --> 01:03.041
(groan)

01:04.208 --> 01:07.041
(exhales deeply)

01:07.083 --> 01:08.709
(Charlotte, thinking) DAMN IT.

01:16.709 --> 01:19.208
EVEN THOUGH I WON'T BE BACK
IN MY OFFICE UNTIL I GIVE BIRTH,

01:19.250 --> 01:20.583
I'M STILL RUNNING THINGS HERE.

01:20.625 --> 01:22.208
SO Y'ALL NEED TO COME UP
WITH FIVE WAYS

01:22.250 --> 01:24.208
TO IMPROVE
THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.667
'CAUSE I'M HERE TO TELL YOU,
IT SUCKS.

01:26.709 --> 01:28.041
THAT'S IT.

01:28.083 --> 01:30.041
(indistinct conversations)

01:30.083 --> 01:32.041
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

01:32.083 --> 01:34.333
DID ADDISON SAY THIS IS OKAY?

01:34.375 --> 01:37.333
SHE SAID I HAD TO SAY IN THIS
POSITION FOR 48 HOURS STRAIGHT.

01:37.375 --> 01:39.250
WELL, THIS IS NOT BED REST.

01:39.291 --> 01:41.709
THIS IS RUNNING A HOSPITAL
FROM A BED.

01:41.750 --> 01:43.291
POTATO. PO-TAH-TO.

01:43.333 --> 01:44.709
HOW'S MY GIRL?

01:44.750 --> 01:47.875
THIS IS AN HOUR AGO.

01:47.917 --> 01:49.750
SHE'S SO TINY.

01:49.792 --> 01:51.917
SMALL BUT MIGHTY,
LIKE HER MAMA.

01:51.959 --> 01:54.959
I THINK SHE'S GETTING TIRED
OF "BABY KING-FREEDMAN"

01:55.000 --> 01:56.542
ON THE SIDE
OF HER INCUBATOR.

01:56.583 --> 01:58.208
SHE TELL YOU THAT?
MM-HMM.

01:58.250 --> 02:00.041
I CAN'T NAME HER
UNTIL I MEET HER.

02:00.083 --> 02:02.458
YOU'LL MEET HER SOON.
I PROMISE.

02:02.500 --> 02:05.041
(groans)
I STILL LIKE MATHILDA.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.709
YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

02:06.750 --> 02:09.333
I'M GONNA PUT IT
ON THE BOARD.

02:09.375 --> 02:10.792
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

02:10.834 --> 02:12.250
DON'T WORRY, BABY.

02:12.291 --> 02:16.000
HE'LL CALL YOU MATHILDA
OVER MY COLD DEAD BODY.

02:16.041 --> 02:18.291
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

02:18.333 --> 02:20.542
I WONDER IF THERE'S ASBESTOS
UNDER THERE.

02:20.583 --> 02:22.083
(Violet speaking indistinctly)
NOT GOOD FOR THE BABIES

02:22.125 --> 02:23.792
OR ANY OTHER PATIENT
IN THIS PLACE.

02:23.834 --> 02:26.083
LORD, I'D SELL MY SOUL
FOR ARMS LONG ENOUGH

02:26.125 --> 02:27.667
TO SCRATCH THOSE TOES.
(Sheldon speaking indistinctly)

02:27.709 --> 02:29.041
BOY, DO I NEED A PEDICURE.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.041
CHARLOTTE, TELL SHELDON
HE HAS TO NICK.

02:31.083 --> 02:32.750
NICK THE PEDOPHILE?

02:32.792 --> 02:33.959
HIS NAME IS NICK CALHOUN.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.750
WHO CARES WHAT HIS NAME IS?

02:35.792 --> 02:37.291
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A MAN
WHO TOOK A 7 YEAR OLD

02:37.333 --> 02:39.417
FROM MY HOSPITAL AND DID
GOD KNOWS WHAT TO HER.

02:39.458 --> 02:41.333
THAT IS THE NICK
YOU'RE REFERRING TO, RIGHT?

02:41.375 --> 02:42.959
WHY ON EARTH
WOULD YOU VISIT HIM?

02:43.000 --> 02:45.166
HE CALLED ME, DEPRESSED. HE'D
BEEN IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT.

02:45.208 --> 02:48.291
EXCUSE ME, DR. KING.
I NEED TO PLACE ANOTHER I.V.

02:48.333 --> 02:49.583
GET ON WITH IT THEN.

02:49.625 --> 02:51.041
I HAVEN'T DECIDED
WHAT TO DO.

02:51.083 --> 02:53.041
SHELDON, HE REACHED OUT TO YOU.
YOU HAVE TO SEE HIM.

02:53.083 --> 02:54.959
WELL, NOW THAT HE'S BEEN
INCARCERATED,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.041
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
IF HE'S STILL MY PATIENT

02:57.083 --> 02:58.750
OR WHAT MY OBLIGATION IS--

02:58.792 --> 03:00.333
YOUR ONLY OBLIGATION IS
TO YOU.

03:00.375 --> 03:01.625
OW!
(gasps)

03:01.667 --> 03:03.709
HAVE YOU DONE THIS BEFORE?

03:03.750 --> 03:04.750
STEPHANIE.

03:04.792 --> 03:06.542
GO. NOW.

03:06.583 --> 03:08.375
AND DON'T COME BACK.

03:08.417 --> 03:10.583
WHERE THE HELL WE'D FIND HER?

03:10.625 --> 03:12.625
SHE CAN'T RESTART AN I.V.
MY 9 YEAR OLD COULD DO THAT.

03:12.667 --> 03:14.834
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WENT
TO SEE KATIE,

03:14.875 --> 03:16.834
I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT HER,
BUT REALLY, IT HELPED ME.

03:16.875 --> 03:19.041
HOW WOULD VISITING
NICK THE PEDOPHILE HELP SHELDON?

03:19.083 --> 03:20.792
CAN YOU STOP
CALLING HIM THAT?

03:20.834 --> 03:22.041
THE GUY WHO TOOK
SARAH NELSON?

03:22.083 --> 03:24.875
UH, SORRY.
NOT MY CONVERSATION.

03:24.917 --> 03:26.834
OKAY, LOOK,
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO HELP.

03:26.875 --> 03:28.667
I TRIED TO HELP HIM
AND I FAILED.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.125
(Charlotte) NO, HE FAILED.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.750
NOW HE DESERVES TO ROT, ALONE.

03:32.792 --> 03:35.125
ALL DONE.

03:35.166 --> 03:37.417
DO YOU KNOW...

03:37.458 --> 03:38.792
HOW IS SARAH?

03:38.834 --> 03:40.542
WELL, I RECOMMENDED
A PEDIATRIC PSYCHIATRIST,

03:40.583 --> 03:42.458
ONE WHO SPECIALIZES
IN SEXUAL TRAUMA.

03:42.500 --> 03:45.417
HER PARENTS ARE
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC.

03:45.458 --> 03:46.625
I'M GLAD.

03:46.667 --> 03:49.375
I'D LIKE TO CASTRATE
NICK THE PEDOPHILE,

03:49.417 --> 03:51.417
BUT I'M GLAD.

03:51.458 --> 03:53.834
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

03:53.875 --> 03:56.208
I LIKE HER.

03:56.250 --> 03:58.291
(imitating Addison)
CHARLOTTE, I'M YOUR DOCTOR.

03:58.333 --> 03:59.917
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME.

03:59.959 --> 04:02.709
TO STOP THE LABOR,
WE NEED TO KEEP YOU SUPINE

04:02.750 --> 04:06.000
WITH YOUR LEGS 30 DEGREES
OVER YOUR HEAD.

04:06.041 --> 04:07.458
IT'S CALLED TRENDELENBURG.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.417
(normal voice)
DR. TRENDELENBURG WOULD'VE HAD

04:09.458 --> 04:11.458
A LOT OF FANS
DURING THE SPANISH INQUISITION.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.041
SADISTIC BASTARD.

04:13.083 --> 04:14.667
(exhales deeply)

04:14.709 --> 04:16.875
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

04:16.917 --> 04:19.875
(bell chiming)

04:19.917 --> 04:21.500
(exhales deeply)

04:21.542 --> 04:24.041
YES, DR. KING?
IT'S BAD ENOUGH
I'M LIVING UPSIDE DOWN.

04:24.083 --> 04:25.959
CAN'T I GET A DECENT PILLOW?

04:27.792 --> 04:28.875
TOUGH DAY?

04:28.917 --> 04:30.041
OH, WHAT TIPPED YOU OFF?

04:30.083 --> 04:31.667
WELL, TWO WEEKS IN BED IS
A LONG TIME.

04:31.709 --> 04:32.750
THAT'S NOTHING COMPARED

04:32.792 --> 04:34.041
TO THE SIX WEEKS
I STILL HAVE COMING.

04:34.083 --> 04:35.834
HOW WAS SCHOOL TODAY, BUDDY?

04:35.875 --> 04:37.041
IT WAS FINE.

04:37.083 --> 04:39.417
OH, CAN I GO GET A SNACK
BEFORE I START MY HOMEWORK?

04:39.458 --> 04:40.959
SURE.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.041
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

04:44.083 --> 04:47.250
SO MUCH FOR TODAY'S
MOTHER-SON QUALITY TIME.

04:47.291 --> 04:49.041
HE TALKING TO YOU?

04:49.083 --> 04:52.041
UH, SOME. YOU KNOW,
HE'S PROCESSING EVERYTHING.

04:52.083 --> 04:53.750
OOH!

04:53.792 --> 04:55.291
LUCAS LOVES
HAVING HIM STAY WITH US.

04:55.333 --> 04:56.959
I'M AFRAID HE'S GONNA DEMAND
AN OLDER BROTHER

04:57.000 --> 04:58.041
AFTER YOU GUYS COME HOME.

04:58.083 --> 05:00.458
MM.

05:00.500 --> 05:03.542
I CAN'T GET COOPER
TO LEAVE THE NICU AT NIGHT.

05:03.583 --> 05:05.667
HE LOOKS LIKE
DEATH ON TOAST.

05:05.709 --> 05:07.750
YOU KNOW,
NOT THAT I'M ONE TO TALK.

05:07.792 --> 05:10.291
WELL, YOU'RE IN A PERIOD
OF TRANSITION,

05:10.333 --> 05:11.792
AND THE STRESS RELATED--

05:11.834 --> 05:13.542
STOP.
I DON'T NEED A SHRINK.

05:13.583 --> 05:14.750
RIGHT. (chuckles)

05:14.792 --> 05:15.917
I NEED FOR MY DAUGHTER
TO GET STRONGER.

05:15.959 --> 05:17.792
I NEED TO KEEP THESE BUNS
IN THE OVEN.

05:17.834 --> 05:20.375
BUT I DON'T NEED A SHRINK.

05:20.417 --> 05:23.041
OF COURSE, BEING ABLE TO PEE
IN THE TOILET WOULD BE NICE.

05:23.083 --> 05:25.333
YEAH. WELL,
I CAN'T HELP YOU THERE,

05:25.375 --> 05:29.625
BUT IF YOU EVER FIND YOURSELF
ON THE VERGE OF LOSING IT,

05:29.667 --> 05:31.000
DISTRACTION WORKS WELL.

05:31.041 --> 05:32.375
SOME PEOPLE COUNT TO TEN,

05:32.417 --> 05:34.417
AND TAKING REALLY DEEP BREATHS
CAN HELP.

05:34.458 --> 05:37.333
I KNOW IT SOUNDS LAME,
BUT IT WORKS.

05:37.375 --> 05:40.166
THESE... ARE GOOD, TOO.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.542
(chuckles) STRESS BALLS.

05:43.583 --> 05:45.000
(laughs)

05:45.041 --> 05:47.792
SQUEEZE THEM INSTEAD OF
BITING SOMEBODY'S HEAD OFF.

05:47.834 --> 05:50.000
IT'S ALMOST AS GOOD
AS TALKING TO A SHRINK.

05:51.875 --> 05:53.041
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE?

05:53.083 --> 05:54.667
THESE ARE PLENTY.

05:56.291 --> 05:58.875
HANG IN THERE, MAMA.

05:58.917 --> 06:00.875
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

06:00.917 --> 06:03.917
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

06:10.083 --> 06:11.709
(sighs)

06:14.083 --> 06:15.583
(sniffles)

06:15.625 --> 06:18.041
(bell chiming)

06:18.083 --> 06:21.667
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO FIND
A DAMN PILLOW?

06:24.709 --> 06:27.041
SHE'S GOT
HER DADDY'S HANDS.

06:27.083 --> 06:28.291
PULSE OX HAS IMPROVED.

06:28.333 --> 06:29.709
(Sam)
HER HEART RATE IS STABLE.

06:29.750 --> 06:31.375
I'M GONNA
TEACH YOU PIANO FIRST

06:31.417 --> 06:33.041
BECAUSE THEN GUITAR'S
GONNA BE A SNAP.

06:33.083 --> 06:35.834
SHE'S TRIGGERING THE VENT
ALL BY HERSELF.

06:35.875 --> 06:37.834
WAIT. WHAT?
SHE'S BREATHING ON HER OWN?

06:37.875 --> 06:39.041
YEAH. I CAN TAKE HER
OFF THE VENTILATOR NOW.

06:39.083 --> 06:40.792
IS IT--IS IT OKAY? REALLY?

06:40.834 --> 06:42.625
YEAH. SHE'S READY.
I MEAN, WE DON'T HAVE TO
RUSH IT, RIGHT?

06:42.667 --> 06:44.792
OH, I'M DONE.

06:44.834 --> 06:46.208
WOW. OKAY.
WHAT'S--WHAT'S NEXT?

06:46.250 --> 06:47.583
KANGAROO CARE.

06:47.625 --> 06:49.166
I-I GET TO HOLD HER?

06:49.208 --> 06:51.041
YEAH. UNBUTTON YOUR SHIRT
AND SIT DOWN.

06:51.083 --> 06:52.583
WHOA. IT SOUNDS SO DIFFERENT
WHEN CHARLOTTE SAYS IT.

06:52.625 --> 06:53.917
(laughs)
SKIN-TO-SKIN CONTACT

06:53.959 --> 06:56.041
HAS BEEN KNOWN
TO IMPROVE OXYGEN SATURATION,

06:56.083 --> 06:57.500
RESPIRATION,

06:57.542 --> 06:58.792
HEART RATE.

06:58.834 --> 07:02.125
HERE WE GO.

07:02.166 --> 07:03.291
I'M READY.

07:03.333 --> 07:05.458
OKAY, SWEETIE.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.083
THERE.
OKAY.

07:07.125 --> 07:08.542
(laughs)

07:08.583 --> 07:09.834
HI, SWEETIE. (laughs)

07:09.875 --> 07:11.250
OKAY.

07:11.291 --> 07:12.500
I'M DADDY.

07:12.542 --> 07:13.834
YOU GOT HER?

07:13.875 --> 07:15.041
YEAH.

07:15.083 --> 07:17.208
OH, MY GOODNESS.

07:17.250 --> 07:19.834
OXYGENATION'S IMPROVING.

07:19.875 --> 07:22.750
LOOK AT THAT.
IT'S LIKE MAGIC.

07:22.792 --> 07:23.959
OH, HERE.

07:25.083 --> 07:26.750
OKAY.

07:27.709 --> 07:29.208
SAY, "HELLO, MAMA."

07:29.250 --> 07:30.500
(high-pitched voice)
HELLO, MAMA.

07:30.542 --> 07:32.041
(cell phone camera shutter
clicks)

07:32.083 --> 07:33.625
(man)
THE BALL IS THROWN AWAY...
(remote clicks)

07:33.667 --> 07:35.041
(man) WE'VE GOT
BETTER NEWS FOR YOU TOMORROW.

07:35.083 --> 07:37.041
(click)
(woman speaking
indistinctly on TV)

07:37.083 --> 07:38.750
(Charlotte, thinking)
WHAT'D SHE DO?

07:38.792 --> 07:41.375
WHAT, STEAL YOUR MAN?
RUN OVER YOUR DOG?

07:41.417 --> 07:44.458
(laughs) DAMN, GIRL.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.125
YOU FIGHT DIRTY.
(laughs)

07:47.166 --> 07:48.917
NO HAIR PULLING?

07:48.959 --> 07:50.750
HUH.
(woman) IS THAT
YOUR BABY DADDY?!

07:50.792 --> 07:52.583
HUH.

07:52.625 --> 07:55.583
SO THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
WHEN YOUR BRAIN CELLS DIE.

07:55.625 --> 07:57.709
(man) OH, HELL, NO.
OH, NO, YOU DIDN'T!

07:57.750 --> 07:58.959
(turns off TV)

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

08:04.333 --> 08:05.458
OH.

08:05.500 --> 08:06.542
(sniffles)

08:06.583 --> 08:08.041
(bell chiming)

08:08.083 --> 08:10.375
(clicking button)

08:10.417 --> 08:12.625
(chiming continues)

08:12.667 --> 08:14.166
YOU ONLY HAVE TO
PRESS IT ONCE.

08:14.208 --> 08:15.417
WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE?

08:15.458 --> 08:18.583
WORK, WHICH I SHOULD
BE GETTING BACK TO.

08:18.625 --> 08:20.750
HEY, DO YOU LIKE YOUR JOB?

08:20.792 --> 08:22.542
IS THIS A TRICK QUESTION?

08:22.583 --> 08:24.583
NO.
THEN YES.

08:24.625 --> 08:26.625
I MEAN, I KNOW SOME PEOPLE
THINK THAT NURSES ARE

08:26.667 --> 08:29.750
JUST FRUSTRATED DOCTORS,
BUT I LIKE BEING MORE HANDS-ON.

08:29.792 --> 08:31.125
THEN IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY.

08:31.166 --> 08:32.917
I'M MAKING YOU
MY PRIVATE NURSE.

08:32.959 --> 08:35.709
NO ONE ELSE HERE KNOWS THEIR ASS
FROM A HOLE IN THE GROUND.

08:35.750 --> 08:37.375
I'M THE FLOOR MANAGER,
DR. KING.

08:37.417 --> 08:38.709
I CAN'T CATER
TO JUST ONE PATIENT.

08:38.750 --> 08:39.750
YOU CAN NOW.

08:39.792 --> 08:41.583
FIGURE IT OUT.

08:41.625 --> 08:44.041
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

08:44.083 --> 08:46.417
OFF THE VENT.
(whispers) OH, MY GOD.

08:46.458 --> 08:47.583
HI.
HI.

08:47.625 --> 08:48.834
(Charlotte) LET'S SEE.

08:48.875 --> 08:50.667
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
AROUND HERE MUCH.

08:50.709 --> 08:51.542
I-I'VE BEEN BUSY.

08:51.583 --> 08:53.041
OKAY. I'LL, UH...

08:53.083 --> 08:55.041
OKAY. TAKE CARE. YEAH.
YEAH.

08:55.083 --> 08:58.041
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

09:00.083 --> 09:03.583
OKAY, UH, I'M GONNA...

09:03.625 --> 09:05.000
SAM, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YEP.

09:05.041 --> 09:06.625
YOU SHOULD GO, TOO, COOP.
HOME.
MM.

09:06.667 --> 09:08.834
SHE'LL BE OKAY WITHOUT YOU
FOR ONE NIGHT.

09:08.875 --> 09:12.208
I'LL GO GET SOME CLOTHES,
I GUESS.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.709
(groans)

09:20.750 --> 09:21.709
DAMN IT.

09:21.750 --> 09:24.208
CONTRACTION.

09:24.250 --> 09:27.834
I THINK IT WAS, UM,
JUST THE ONE.

09:27.875 --> 09:29.375
NO, YOU'VE BEEN HAVING
CONTRACTIONS

09:29.417 --> 09:31.166
EVERY THREE MINUTES.
THAT WAS JUST PRESSURE.

09:31.208 --> 09:33.458
I DON'T THINK
IT'S ACTUALLY A CONTRACTION.
OKAY.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.417
LOOK, WE'VE GOT YOU
ON TOCOLYTICS

09:35.458 --> 09:36.792
AND WE'VE PUT YOU
IN TRENDELENBURG.

09:36.834 --> 09:39.291
I MEAN, WE COULD--WE COULD ADD
A MAGNESIUM DRIP.

09:39.333 --> 09:41.709
IT'S NOT STANDARD TREATMENT
ANYMORE, BUT IT'S WORTH A TRY.

09:41.750 --> 09:43.041
IT WILL PROVIDE
NEURAL PROTECTION

09:43.083 --> 09:44.583
AND IT MIGHT STOP
THE CONTRACTIONS.

09:44.625 --> 09:47.625
MIGHT? YOU SAID 48 HOURS.

09:47.667 --> 09:49.250
THAT'S ALL I HAD TO GO
WITHOUT A CONTRACTION

09:49.291 --> 09:50.709
TO BE ABLE TO LAY FLAT.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.875
THAT WAS MY BIG PRIZE--
NOT STANDING UP,

09:52.917 --> 09:55.625
NOT GETTING TO USE
THE ACTUAL TOILET,

09:55.667 --> 09:57.542
NOT SEEING MY BABY.

09:57.583 --> 09:59.625
LAYING FLAT...

09:59.667 --> 10:02.041
I WAS LIVING FOR THAT.

10:02.083 --> 10:04.625
I ONLY NEEDED 16 MORE HOURS.

10:04.667 --> 10:07.041
(sighs)

10:07.083 --> 10:10.750
I DID NOT SIGN UP FOR THIS.

10:14.542 --> 10:17.583
(Bollywood style music playing)

10:24.834 --> 10:27.917
(woman singing
in foreign language)

10:45.208 --> 10:47.500
OKAY.

10:47.542 --> 10:48.709
LOOKS LIKE GOOD NEWS.

10:48.750 --> 10:50.500
THIS IS ALL JUST A BAD DREAM,

10:50.542 --> 10:52.542
AND I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS
WITH THREE HEALTHY BABIES?

10:52.583 --> 10:57.583
NO, BUT YOU HAVE STOPPED HAVING
CONTRACTIONS FOR TWO DAYS,

10:57.625 --> 10:59.792
SO YOU GET TO LIE FLAT.

10:59.834 --> 11:00.875
OHH, GREAT.

11:00.917 --> 11:03.583
(bed whirring)
HOW'S THAT FEEL?

11:03.625 --> 11:06.417
AH. STILL NOT THE ANGLE I WANT
TO SEE CHRISTMAS FROM.

11:06.458 --> 11:07.500
MM.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.083
IT WAS GONNA BE GREAT.

11:09.125 --> 11:11.709
I WAS GONNA SIT MY FAT ASS
ON THE COUCH

11:11.750 --> 11:14.917
WITH THREE BABIES COOKING
IN MY ENORMOUS BELLY...

11:14.959 --> 11:16.750
(chuckles) WHILE I DRANK
VIRGIN EGGNOG.

11:16.792 --> 11:18.500
I'M SORRY, CHARLOTTE.

11:18.542 --> 11:20.083
I AM GONNA KEEP YOU
ON THE MAGNESIUM DRIP

11:20.125 --> 11:22.291
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE HELPING,
BUT IF YOU HAVE

11:22.333 --> 11:25.125
ANY OTHER CONTRACTIONS, I GOTTA
PUT YOU BACK ON TRENDELENBURG.

11:25.166 --> 11:29.208
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

11:29.250 --> 11:31.041
YOU'RE LURKING.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

11:31.083 --> 11:32.834
I'M HERE
ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD.

11:32.875 --> 11:34.375
UH, WE THOUGHT MAYBE,

11:34.417 --> 11:36.333
UM, GIVEN YOUR CONDITION,
MAYBE--

11:36.375 --> 11:37.750
SPIT IT OUT, LISA.

11:37.792 --> 11:40.041
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
PASSING ALONG

11:40.083 --> 11:41.667
SOME OF
YOUR CHIEF OF STAFF DUTIES,

11:41.709 --> 11:44.041
JUST
FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE?

11:44.083 --> 11:46.041
I HAVE COMPILED A LIST
OF CANDIDATES HERE.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.166
HAVE YOU?

11:47.208 --> 11:50.041
WELL, THANKS,
BUT THERE'S NO NEED.

11:50.083 --> 11:52.625
UH, WELL, THE BOARD IS JUST
THINKING OF YOUR HEALTH.

11:52.667 --> 11:54.583
REALLY?
THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE THINKING

11:54.625 --> 11:57.417
WHEN THEY SENT A MID-LEVEL
HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGER

11:57.458 --> 12:00.041
TO RELIEVE ME OF MY DUTIES?

12:00.083 --> 12:01.583
(exhales)

12:01.625 --> 12:04.000
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT
THE SCARIEST THING IN THE WORLD

12:04.041 --> 12:06.041
IS TO AN H.R. DEPARTMENT?
A PREGNANT WOMAN.

12:06.083 --> 12:07.709
JURIES LOVE PREGNANT WOMEN.

12:07.750 --> 12:09.041
THEY ESPECIALLY LOVE
WHEN WE HAVE TWINS,

12:09.083 --> 12:12.250
AND OH, MY,
DO THEY ADORE TRIPLETS.

12:12.291 --> 12:14.458
YOU SEE, RIGHT NOW,
IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE

12:14.500 --> 12:16.667
MY EMPLOYERS ARE TRYING
TO FIRE A PREGNANT WOMAN,

12:16.709 --> 12:19.709
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE,
I WILL SUE YOU AND THEM

12:19.750 --> 12:21.041
AND THE WHOLE HOSPITAL.

12:21.083 --> 12:23.041
AND THE ONLY ONE
WHO WILL STILL BE HERE

12:23.083 --> 12:24.834
IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE

12:24.875 --> 12:28.667
IS A VERY RICH ME.

12:28.709 --> 12:31.709
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

12:42.083 --> 12:46.875
YOU'RE SITTING AT THE BAR,
ALONE.

12:46.917 --> 12:48.917
I SIDLE UP NEXT TO YOU,

12:48.959 --> 12:51.041
ORDER A MARTINI.

12:51.083 --> 12:54.041
I'M IN THIGH-HIGH BLACK BOOTS

12:54.083 --> 12:57.959
AND A SILK SLIP
THAT'S NOT QUITE

12:58.000 --> 13:00.041
long enough to be decent.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.083
LIPS?

13:01.125 --> 13:02.458
CHERRY RED.

13:02.500 --> 13:03.709
OH, I LOVE THIS ONE.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.000
MM, YOU NEVER HEARD
THIS ONE.

13:06.500 --> 13:07.625
WE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER.

13:07.667 --> 13:08.625
We don't?

13:08.667 --> 13:09.709
NOPE.

13:09.750 --> 13:12.041
I touch your hand,

13:12.083 --> 13:14.083
ask you for a light.

13:14.125 --> 13:16.583
But I drop my cigarette,
and when

13:16.625 --> 13:18.041
I LEAN OVER TO GET IT,

13:18.083 --> 13:22.291
THE SLIP RIDES UP
JUST ENOUGH FOR YOU TO SEE

13:22.333 --> 13:24.750
THAT I AM NOT WEARING

13:24.792 --> 13:26.583
any--
OH, YOU'RE KILLING ME.

13:26.625 --> 13:27.583
(chuckles)

13:27.625 --> 13:29.667
WHAT IF MY WIFE CATCHES US?

13:29.709 --> 13:31.959
WELL, IS SHE HOT?
MAYBE WE CAN ALL--

13:32.000 --> 13:34.542
OH, I GOTTA GO.
Wait. What?

13:34.583 --> 13:36.083
WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. NO, I H--

13:36.125 --> 13:38.250
I--YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME HANGING
LIKE THIS.

13:38.291 --> 13:40.875
FEMALE ORGASMS BRING ON
UTERINE CONTRACTIONS.

13:40.917 --> 13:42.792
NO.
YOU WANT TWO MORE PREEMIES?

13:42.834 --> 13:45.041
OH, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
PLEASE TELL ME THAT'S NOT TRUE.

13:45.083 --> 13:47.041
WELL, IF I CAN'T FINISH,
NEITHER CAN YOU.

13:47.083 --> 13:48.125
I LOVE YOU.

13:48.166 --> 13:50.041
I LOVE YOU.

13:56.792 --> 13:59.583
DRIP.

13:59.625 --> 14:01.750
DRIP.

14:01.792 --> 14:03.041
DRIP. (sighs)

14:03.083 --> 14:05.041
WHERE THE HELL'S THAT IDIOT
FROM ENGINEERING?

14:05.083 --> 14:07.792
I PUT IN A REQUEST TO FIX
THE FAUCET YESTERDAY

14:07.834 --> 14:09.333
AND THE DAY BEFORE.

14:09.375 --> 14:10.709
HE'S FIRED.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.333
WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE,
EVERYONE'S FIRED.

14:12.375 --> 14:14.583
(inhales and exhales deeply)

14:14.625 --> 14:17.375
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

14:17.417 --> 14:18.875
(exhales deeply)

14:18.917 --> 14:20.583
(woman continues speaking
indistinctly over p.a.)

14:20.625 --> 14:22.333
OH, A PILLOW CAN MUFFLE
A GUNSHOT,

14:22.375 --> 14:24.000
BUT NOT THAT DAMN DRIP?

14:24.041 --> 14:25.750
(sighs)

14:25.792 --> 14:28.959
8:07. HERE SHE COMES.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.750
LOOK... AT... HER.

14:31.792 --> 14:34.000
YOU JUST KNOW
HER NAME'S ASHLEY.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.542
ENJOY THOSE PERKY BOOBS
WHILE YOU CAN, MISSY.

14:36.583 --> 14:38.041
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
YOU'LL NEED A PUSH-UP BRA

14:38.083 --> 14:39.834
TO KEEP THOSE GIRLS
AT ATTENTION.

14:39.875 --> 14:41.250
OW!

14:41.291 --> 14:42.750
OH.

14:42.792 --> 14:43.834
NO.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.792
THAT'S NOT A CONTRACTION.

14:45.834 --> 14:48.000
GAS. THAT'S ALL.

14:48.041 --> 14:50.083
JUST GAS.

14:50.125 --> 14:53.792
WHO'D THEY BRIBE TO ESCAPE THIS
HELLHOLE WITH A HEALTHY BABY?

14:53.834 --> 14:55.041
OW!

14:55.083 --> 14:58.041
SON OF A BITCH,
THAT FELT LIKE A CONTRACTION.

14:58.083 --> 14:59.875
NO. DON'T GO THERE.

14:59.917 --> 15:02.208
IT'S PROBABLY JUST--AH! OH.

15:02.250 --> 15:03.875
OKAY.

15:03.917 --> 15:06.208
THAT'S FOUR. THIS IS BAD.

15:06.250 --> 15:07.709
VERY BAD.

15:07.750 --> 15:10.792
IF THIS KEEPS UP, ADDISON'LL
PUT ME BACK UPSIDE DOWN,

15:10.834 --> 15:12.834
AND CANDY STRIPER ASHLEY
WILL STEAL MY HUSBAND,

15:12.875 --> 15:14.667
AND THE HAPPY FAMILY WILL TAKE
MASON AND MY BABY,

15:14.709 --> 15:17.667
AND THE FAUCET
WILL JUST KEEP DRIPPING.

15:17.709 --> 15:18.709
(panting)

15:18.750 --> 15:20.959
ADDISON DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW.

15:22.917 --> 15:25.041
(grunts)

15:25.083 --> 15:26.291
(beeps)

15:29.709 --> 15:31.291
(grunts)

15:31.333 --> 15:32.750
THAT SHOULD DO IT.

15:32.792 --> 15:35.041
(pants)

15:35.083 --> 15:37.542
(exhales deeply)

15:41.291 --> 15:43.625
HEY.

15:43.667 --> 15:44.875
COME GIVE ME A HUG.

15:44.917 --> 15:46.625
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

15:46.667 --> 15:48.250
MM.

15:48.291 --> 15:49.542
(kisses)

15:49.583 --> 15:51.709
MM.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.458
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR SHIRT?

15:53.500 --> 15:56.375
I RIPPED IT DURING RECESS.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.625
IS THAT A BITE MARK?

16:00.667 --> 16:01.875
WHO DID THIS TO YOU?

16:01.917 --> 16:03.542
JUST THIS KID AT SCHOOL.
OKAY?

16:03.583 --> 16:05.875
HE'S BIGGER THAN ME,
BEAT ME UP.

16:05.917 --> 16:07.000
WELL, YOU ALL RIGHT?
DOES IT HURT?

16:07.041 --> 16:08.041
I'M FINE.

16:08.083 --> 16:11.583
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

16:11.625 --> 16:13.041
NEAL SEGAL.

16:13.083 --> 16:17.083
GO ASK STEPHANIE
TO CLEAN THAT UP. OKAY?

16:17.125 --> 16:21.083
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

16:21.125 --> 16:23.083
THINK YOU CAN BEAT UP
ON MY KID?

16:23.125 --> 16:25.458
THINK AGAIN, NEAL SEGAL.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.750
LET'S JUST FIND YOUR PARENTS.

16:33.625 --> 16:35.417
(clicking, bell chiming)

16:35.458 --> 16:36.583
WHAT'S WRONG?

16:36.625 --> 16:38.417
GET THIS TRAY AWAY FROM ME.

16:38.458 --> 16:39.792
THE ONLY THING WORSE
THAN TRYING TO GET IT DOWN

16:39.834 --> 16:41.709
IS WAITING FOR IT
TO COME BACK UP.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.041
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE

16:43.083 --> 16:45.125
THE CHRISTMAS BUFFET
YOU PUT OUT.

16:45.166 --> 16:46.709
UGH. HOW DO PEOPLE
EAT THIS STUFF?

16:46.750 --> 16:48.333
YEAH. TOO BAD ONE OF US
DOESN'T HAVE CONTROL

16:48.375 --> 16:50.375
OVER THE QUALITY OF FOOD
IN THIS PLACE.

16:50.417 --> 16:52.625
HEY. HOW YOU FEELING?
STEPH.

16:52.667 --> 16:54.000
HI.

16:54.041 --> 16:55.792
SAME AS I WAS WHEN YOU
ASKED ME AN HOUR AGO.

16:55.834 --> 16:58.041
(laughs) THIS ONE GIVING YOU
A HARD TIME?

16:58.083 --> 16:59.750
OH, IT'S NOTHING
I CAN'T HANDLE.

16:59.792 --> 17:02.125
YEAH, WELL, AT LEAST YOU CAN
STICK HER WITH NEEDLES.

17:02.166 --> 17:04.583
(laughs)

17:04.625 --> 17:05.750
(laughs)

17:05.792 --> 17:10.041
OH, NEEDLES.

17:10.083 --> 17:12.750
OKAY. WELL, I'LL LET YOU
GET YOUR REST.

17:12.792 --> 17:14.250
(pats bed)

17:14.291 --> 17:16.041
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

17:16.083 --> 17:18.041
TELL ME SOMETHING--

17:18.083 --> 17:19.750
YOU STILL INTO SAM?

17:19.792 --> 17:21.792
THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS.

17:21.834 --> 17:23.041
WELL, THE LEAST YOU CAN DO IS
ENTERTAIN ME.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.750
NO, I MAY BE
YOUR BECK-AND-CALL GIRL,

17:24.792 --> 17:26.041
BUT I'M NOT
YOUR SOCIAL DIRECTOR,

17:26.083 --> 17:27.166
AND I DEFINITELY
DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO YOU

17:27.208 --> 17:28.417
ABOUT MY PERSONAL LIFE.

17:28.458 --> 17:29.959
SO YOU ARE STILL INTO SAM.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.166
OH.

17:31.208 --> 17:32.875
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

17:32.917 --> 17:36.000
YOUR I.V. BAG EMPTIED FASTER
THAN I EXPECTED.

17:36.041 --> 17:37.375
REALLY?

17:37.417 --> 17:40.000
YEAH. AT THE FLOW RATE I SET,
THERE SHOULD BE PLENTY LEFT.

17:40.041 --> 17:41.875
YOU GONNA GIVE SAM
ANOTHER CHANCE?

17:41.917 --> 17:45.542
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

17:47.709 --> 17:50.041
YOUR BROTHER WANTS TO HAVE
A PARTY WHEN YOU COME HOME,

17:50.083 --> 17:52.625
WITH BALLOONS AND STREAMERS

17:52.667 --> 17:54.458
AND A CLOWN.

17:54.500 --> 17:57.166
ALTHOUGH HONESTLY,
CLOWNS ARE A LITTLE CREEPY.

17:57.208 --> 17:58.709
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

17:58.750 --> 18:00.917
IF YOU NEED A BREAK,
I'M HERE.

18:00.959 --> 18:02.667
NO, I'M GOOD. THANKS.

18:02.709 --> 18:05.625
HER PULSE OX IS
A LITTLE LOWER THAN NORMAL.

18:05.667 --> 18:08.375
ON THESE LITTLE ONES,
IT CAN VARY QUITE A BIT.

18:08.417 --> 18:11.291
YEAH. BUT HER HEART RATE'S
BEEN CREEPING UP.

18:11.333 --> 18:14.041
I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE
ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

18:14.083 --> 18:17.041
DOCTOR PARENTS ARE ALWAYS
A LITTLE OVERANXIOUS.

18:17.083 --> 18:18.875
MM.

18:18.917 --> 18:22.417
SHE'S GOT RHINORRHEA

18:22.458 --> 18:24.625
AND INTERCOSTAL MUSCLE
RETRACTIONS WHEN SHE BREATHES.

18:24.667 --> 18:26.083
I'LL MAKE A NOTE
IN HER CHART.

18:26.125 --> 18:28.625
NO, SHE NEEDS A CHEST X-RAY,
AND SHE NEEDS ARTERIAL BLOOD GAS

18:28.667 --> 18:30.834
AND NASAL WASHINGS.
I WILL LET
THE ATTENDING KNOW--

18:30.875 --> 18:32.458
OKAY, YOU'RE NOT LISTENING
TO ME.

18:32.500 --> 18:33.625
I'M NOT WAITING
FOR THE ATTENDING.

18:33.667 --> 18:34.917
I'M A DOCTOR, I'M HER FATHER,

18:34.959 --> 18:36.834
AND I'M TELLING YOU
TO GO GET TESTS.

18:36.875 --> 18:38.875
YOU GO GET
THE DAMN TESTS. NOW.

18:47.750 --> 18:51.208
(big band music playing)

19:12.000 --> 19:13.250
(man) ...ALABAMA
VERSUS TENNESSEE.

19:13.291 --> 19:15.709
WHOO! FIRST DOWN, BAMA.

19:15.750 --> 19:18.417
ROLL TIDE'S GONNA STAMPEDE
ALL OVER ROCKY TOP.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.375
ALABAMA'S THE CRIMSON TIDE,

19:19.417 --> 19:20.625
BUT THEIR MASCOT'S
AN ELEPHANT.

19:20.667 --> 19:21.917
MAKE ANY SENSE TO YOU?

19:21.959 --> 19:24.041
THAT'S WHAT VOLUNTEER FANS
ALWAYS LATCH ON TO

19:24.083 --> 19:25.417
WHEN THEY'RE GETTING
THEIR BUTTS KICKED.

19:25.458 --> 19:27.166
MAYBE YOU GUYS SHOULD
JUST TURN IT OVER NOW.

19:27.208 --> 19:28.792
TOO MUCH EXCITEMENT MIGHT NOT
BE GOOD FOR THE BABIES.

19:28.834 --> 19:32.333
THESE BABIES ARE FINE. THEY GOT
SOUTHERN BLOOD IN THEIR VEINS.

19:32.375 --> 19:34.000
(man speaking indistinctly
on TV)

19:34.041 --> 19:35.500
THE FIRST ONE'S
OFF THE VENTILATOR.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.041
THAT'S GREAT NEWS,
CHARLOTTE.

19:37.083 --> 19:39.208
SO YOU'VE BEEN ADJUSTING
YOUR MAGNESIUM DRIP?

19:39.250 --> 19:41.208
YES, I HAVE,

19:41.250 --> 19:43.000
AND IT STOPPED THE CONTRACTIONS.

19:43.041 --> 19:44.375
AND YOU KNOW HOW I KNEW
THAT WOULD HAPPEN?

19:44.417 --> 19:46.834
BECAUSE I'M A DOCTOR
AND THE CHIEF OF STAFF.

19:46.875 --> 19:49.041
NO, NOW YOU ARE A PATIENT,
CHARLOTTE.

19:49.083 --> 19:51.041
YOU CAN'T SELF-MEDICATE,
CHARLOTTE. IT'S DANGEROUS.

19:51.083 --> 19:52.458
IT'S ADDISON'S FAULT.

19:52.500 --> 19:55.041
SHE'S THE ONE WHO LEFT AN ADDICT
WITH ACCESS TO DRUGS.

19:55.083 --> 19:58.041
MAGNESIUM IS NOT A NARCOTIC.
NICE TRY.

19:58.083 --> 20:00.000
BUT SINCE YOU CLEARLY
CANNOT BE TRUSTED...
(control pad beeping)

20:00.041 --> 20:02.458
I AM LOCKING THE PUMP.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.041
(man) TENNESSEE'S DEFENSE

20:04.083 --> 20:06.041
IS GONNA HAVE TO TIGHTEN UP
AGAINST THE PASS

20:06.083 --> 20:09.792
OR THIS COULD BE
A LONG GAME.

20:11.625 --> 20:13.959
I ALREADY SUSPECT THE WORST.
IS IT THE WORST?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.375
CHEST X-RAYS SHOW AN INFILTRATE
ON HER LUNGS.

20:16.417 --> 20:18.041
YEAH. THE LABS?

20:18.083 --> 20:19.750
R.S.V. PNEUMONIA.

20:19.792 --> 20:22.041
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT HER
BACK ON THE VENTILATOR.

20:22.083 --> 20:24.125
I SO WANTED TO BE WRONG.

20:24.166 --> 20:26.417
(inhales deeply) ALL RIGHT,
I CAN'T TELL CHARLOTTE.

20:26.458 --> 20:28.041
SHE'S ALREADY IN HELL.

20:28.083 --> 20:29.041
THERE'S NO TREATMENT
FOR THIS VIRUS,

20:29.083 --> 20:31.083
AND W-WITH A BABY SO SMALL...

20:31.125 --> 20:32.083
WE'RE NOT--
WITH A COMPROMISED IMMUNE
SYSTEM. SHE COULD JUST--

20:32.125 --> 20:33.667
WE'RE NOT THERE YET.

20:33.709 --> 20:35.083
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL PUT HER
BACK ON THE VENTILATOR.

20:35.125 --> 20:37.083
WE'LL WATCH HER.

20:37.125 --> 20:39.875
WE'RE NOT THERE YET.

20:39.917 --> 20:41.834
(bell chimes)

20:41.875 --> 20:43.458
(indistinct conversations)

20:43.500 --> 20:45.000
(chimes)

20:45.041 --> 20:46.166
(clicking button, bell chiming)

20:46.208 --> 20:47.458
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

20:47.500 --> 20:50.000
WHY DID YOU TATTLE
TO ADDISON?

20:51.291 --> 20:52.667
THAT'S--THAT'S WHY
YOU CALLED ME IN?

20:52.709 --> 20:54.208
'CAUSE I THOUGHT YOU ACTUALLY
NEEDED SOMETHING.

20:54.250 --> 20:56.500
I DO. I NEED TO KNOW
WHY YOU RATTED ME OUT

20:56.542 --> 20:58.041
ABOUT THE MAGNESIUM DRIP.

20:58.083 --> 21:00.417
'CAUSE IT WAS
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

21:02.083 --> 21:05.000
(clicking button, bell chiming)

21:10.083 --> 21:12.750
I'M THIRSTY.
I NEED SOME WATER.

21:12.792 --> 21:14.000
(chuckles)

21:16.667 --> 21:19.667
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

21:25.333 --> 21:26.834
WHAT ARE YOU, 5?

21:26.875 --> 21:29.625
IT'S NOT MY JOB TO JUMP
WHENEVER YOU'RE BORED.

21:29.667 --> 21:31.583
GET ME ANOTHER NURSE.
NO.

21:31.625 --> 21:34.041
YOU'RE FIRED.
NO, I'M NOT.

21:34.083 --> 21:36.125
YOU ARE DEFINITELY FIRED.

21:36.166 --> 21:38.125
OH, YEAH?
YOU KICK ME TO THE CURB,

21:38.166 --> 21:40.125
THERE'LL BE NOBODY ELSE
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

21:40.166 --> 21:42.041
EVERY OTHER NURSE OUT THERE
WOULD SOONER QUIT

21:42.083 --> 21:43.709
THAN WALK IN THIS ROOM.
OKAY?

21:43.750 --> 21:46.041
I GET THAT YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE,
I GET THAT YOU'RE SCARED,

21:46.083 --> 21:48.000
BUT YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST WOMAN
TO HAVE A HIGH-RISK PREGNANCY,

21:48.041 --> 21:49.750
SO THERE IS NO NEED FOR YOU

21:49.792 --> 21:51.917
TO BE SUCH A MONUMENTAL
PAIN IN THE ASS

21:51.959 --> 21:53.250
AND MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE

21:53.291 --> 21:55.041
FOR ANYBODY
TO FEEL COMPASSION FOR YOU.

21:55.083 --> 21:58.667
NOW I AM TRYING MY VERY BEST
NOT TO SMOTHER YOU WITH A PILLOW

21:58.709 --> 22:00.041
EVERY TIME I WALK
IN THIS ROOM,

22:00.083 --> 22:02.041
BUT YOU ARE SERIOUSLY
TRYING MY PATIENCE.

22:02.083 --> 22:03.583
SO PLEASE,

22:03.625 --> 22:06.333
FOR YOUR HEALTH, FOR THE HEALTH
OF YOUR UNBORN CHILDREN,

22:06.375 --> 22:08.792
DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT PRESSING
THAT CALL BUTTON AGAIN

22:08.834 --> 22:11.458
UNLESS YOU'RE IN LABOR
OR YOU'RE DYING.

22:14.083 --> 22:17.041
(exhales)

22:17.083 --> 22:20.000
(Charlotte) I COMPLETELY AGREE.

22:21.417 --> 22:22.583
YES.

22:22.625 --> 22:26.041
I ASSURE YOU,
IT'S UNDER CONTROL.

22:26.083 --> 22:27.041
(sighs)

22:27.083 --> 22:28.542
WHAT'S WRONG?

22:29.750 --> 22:31.500
IF YOU WERE PAYING ATTENTION
TO OUR SON,

22:31.542 --> 22:34.041
YOU MIGHT'VE NOTICED
THE BITE MARK ON HIS ARM.

22:34.083 --> 22:35.000
SOMEBODY BIT HIM?

22:35.041 --> 22:37.542
IS HE OKAY? WHAT HAPPENED?

22:37.583 --> 22:39.250
HE'S FINE. APPARENTLY,
MASON WAS PICKING ON

22:39.291 --> 22:41.458
A KID IN HIS CLASS--
NEAL SEGAL.

22:41.500 --> 22:43.041
OH, COME ON.
MASON'S A GOOD KID.

22:43.083 --> 22:44.834
THERE'S GOTTA BE MORE
TO THE STORY THAN THAT.

22:44.875 --> 22:46.625
THE PRINCIPAL SAID MASON WAS
PROVOKING NEAL.

22:46.667 --> 22:48.542
THAT'S WHY HE BIT MASON.

22:48.583 --> 22:50.834
WELL, BITING'S NOT OKAY.
WELL, NEITHER IS BULLYING.

22:50.875 --> 22:53.000
TAUNTING A KID IS
JUST ASKING FOR TROUBLE,

22:53.041 --> 22:54.041
AND IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN,

22:54.083 --> 22:55.750
THE PRINCIPAL'S THREATENED
TO SUSPEND HIM.

22:55.792 --> 22:57.333
I WILL GO DOWN TO THE SCHOOL.
I WILL TALK TO THE PRINCIPAL.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.959
NO,
YOU NEED TO TALK TO MASON.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
WE NEED TO CUT HIM
SOME SLACK.

23:02.041 --> 23:04.041
HE IS SCARED AND STRESSED ABOUT
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.041
YOU NEED TO QUIT MAKING EXCUSES.
WE HAVE TO PUNISH HIM.

23:06.083 --> 23:08.166
HE NEEDS STABILITY.
HE NEEDS NURTURING.

23:08.208 --> 23:12.375
WHAT HE NEEDS IS A CLEAR SENSE
OF RIGHT AND WRONG,

23:12.417 --> 23:15.041
AND IF HIS FATHER'S TOO MUCH
OF A WUSS TO TEACH IT TO HIM,

23:15.083 --> 23:17.041
THEN I'LL DO IT,
JUST LIKE I DO EVERYTHING ELSE.

23:17.083 --> 23:19.041
REALLY?

23:19.083 --> 23:21.041
WELL, I'M SORRY I'VE BEEN
IN THE NICU 24 HOURS A DAY,

23:21.083 --> 23:22.917
TRYING TO KEEP
OUR DAUGHTER ALIVE

23:22.959 --> 23:25.709
AND WATCHING SAM PUT HER BACK
ON A VENTILATOR AND--

23:25.750 --> 23:27.083
WAIT.

23:27.125 --> 23:28.834
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

23:28.875 --> 23:30.041
SHE...

23:30.083 --> 23:33.041
SHE HAS R.S.V. PNEUMONIA.

23:33.083 --> 23:35.041
SINCE WHEN?

23:35.083 --> 23:37.041
I NOTICED SOMETHING
THIS MORNING.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.041
I HAD THEM RUN THE TESTS.

23:39.083 --> 23:40.083
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

23:40.125 --> 23:42.041
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU, CHARLOTTE.

23:42.083 --> 23:44.417
(scoffs) LIKE YOU'RE TRYING
TO PROTECT MASON?

23:44.458 --> 23:46.041
YOU ARE SUCH AN IDIOT,
COOPER.

23:46.083 --> 23:48.041
YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE
TRYING TO KEEP

23:48.083 --> 23:49.041
THIS FAMILY TOGETHER,
CHARLOTTE.

23:49.083 --> 23:51.041
NO, I AM THE ONLY ONE
STUCK IN THIS BED...

23:51.083 --> 23:53.667
OH!
EVERY DAMN DAY.
JUST GET THE HELL OUT.

23:53.709 --> 23:55.333
YEAH. GLADLY.

YOU HAVE TO.

25:30.375 --> 25:33.250
IT'S YOUR
NONSHOWER SHOWER!

25:33.291 --> 25:34.834
WHY AREN'T YOU WITH MY BABY,
ADDISON?

25:34.875 --> 25:37.625
BECAUSE COOPER IS. HEY,
I THOUGHT OF A GOOD BABY NAME.

25:37.667 --> 25:39.375
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF OLIVE?

25:39.417 --> 25:41.166
I THINK
IT'S A MARTINI INGREDIENT.

25:41.208 --> 25:42.625
WHY DIDN'T YOU BRING
MASON BY TODAY?

25:42.667 --> 25:44.166
HE DIDN'T WANT TO COME,
AND COOPER SAID IT WAS OKAY.

25:44.208 --> 25:46.667
WELL, SCREW, COOPER.
IF I WANT TO SEE MY DAMN KID,

25:46.709 --> 25:48.583
THAT'S MY GOD-GIVEN RIGHT.
YOU WANT A CUPCAKE?

25:48.625 --> 25:50.000
DO I LOOK LIKE
I WANT A CUPCAKE?

25:50.041 --> 25:51.333
SO THAT'S A NO THEN?

25:51.375 --> 25:52.834
YES, IT'S A NO.
I DON'T WANT YOUR CUPCAKES

25:52.875 --> 25:54.667
OR YOUR FLOWERS
OR YOUR PRESENTS.

25:54.709 --> 25:58.667
WHAT PART OF "I DON'T WANT
A SHOWER" WAS UNCLEAR, AMELIA?

25:58.709 --> 26:00.333
WE THOUGHT THAT
THIS WOULD CHEER YOU UP.

26:00.375 --> 26:01.458
YOU KNOW
WHAT WOULD CHEER ME UP?

26:01.500 --> 26:03.583
IF YOU GOT YOUR ASSES
OUT OF MY ROOM.

26:03.625 --> 26:04.709
MMM. THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

26:04.750 --> 26:06.250
HEY, CHARLOTTE,

26:06.291 --> 26:07.625
FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE ON BED REST

26:07.667 --> 26:10.041
IN THE SAME ROOM
FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME,

26:10.083 --> 26:11.500
IT'S NATURAL THEY DEVELOP
A KIND OF CABIN FEVER...
ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE, SIX,

26:11.542 --> 26:13.000
SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN.

26:13.041 --> 26:15.166
AND ON TOP OF THAT, YOU WANT
TO SEE YOUR BABY GIRL...

26:15.208 --> 26:16.834
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE,
SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN.

26:16.875 --> 26:18.375
IT'S HARD FOR PERSONS
USED TO BEING IN CONTROL...

26:18.417 --> 26:20.500
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE,
SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN.

26:20.542 --> 26:23.000
...TAKE CARE OF THINGS
AND THEM.

26:23.041 --> 26:24.208
SMELL THAT.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.375
WHICH ONE'S A TRAPEZOID?

26:27.417 --> 26:28.583
IT'S A SQUARE AT AN ANGLE?

26:28.625 --> 26:30.917
NO. NO. WAIT. THAT'S A RHOMBUS.

26:30.959 --> 26:32.291
(sighs) ALL THOSE YEARS
IN SCHOOL,

26:32.333 --> 26:34.625
AND THE ONLY THING I REMEMBER
IS THAT CINEMA CLASS.

26:34.667 --> 26:37.208
BY THE WAY,
ELSA DIDN'T LOVE RICK.

26:37.250 --> 26:39.291
(scoffs) LOVE STORY, MY ASS.

26:39.333 --> 26:41.208
EVERY GOOD ROMANCE
ENDS IN DEATH.

26:41.250 --> 26:42.875
WITHOUT A PLANE CRASH,
CONSUMPTION,

26:42.917 --> 26:44.291
OR THIRD-DEGREE BURNS,

26:44.333 --> 26:46.083
TWO PEOPLE CAN'T JUST STAND
THE TEST OF TIME.

26:46.125 --> 26:48.083
MAMA.

26:48.125 --> 26:50.458
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME?

26:50.500 --> 26:52.208
I HEARD YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE ME.

26:52.250 --> 26:54.959
I DIDN'T WANT TO GET YELLED AT.
NEAL BIT ME.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.208
BECAUSE YOU PROVOKED HIM.

26:56.250 --> 26:58.750
AND WHEN YOU PUSH SOMEONE
TOO FAR, WELL--

26:58.792 --> 27:00.500
SOMEDAY I'LL SHOW YOU
"THE BURNING BED,"

27:00.542 --> 27:02.208
AND THEN YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

27:02.250 --> 27:03.542
I NEVER DID IT BEFORE.

27:03.583 --> 27:05.041
THAT'S NOT THE SAME
AS NEVER DOING IT AT ALL.

27:05.083 --> 27:07.333
EVERYONE HATES NEAL.
HE'S WEIRD.

27:07.375 --> 27:08.667
WELL, THAT'S EVEN WORSE.

27:08.709 --> 27:11.542
YOU WANT TO BE A SHEEP?
FOLLOW THE HERD?

27:11.583 --> 27:13.041
OR DO YOU WANT TO BE A MAN?

27:13.083 --> 27:15.333
THE KIND OF PERSON
WHO STICKS UP FOR OTHERS?

27:15.375 --> 27:18.333
NOT ONLY DID YOU BULLY A KID,

27:18.375 --> 27:22.125
WHICH IS HORRIBLE AND CRUEL
AND NEVER OKAY,

27:22.166 --> 27:24.959
BUT YOU LIED TO ME.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.917
DID YOU APOLOGIZE TO NEAL?
NO.

27:26.959 --> 27:29.041
WELL, YOU HAVE TO.
WHY ARE YOU BEING SO MEAN?

27:29.083 --> 27:30.333
WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO SELFISH?

27:30.375 --> 27:32.166
I'M THE ONE STUCK
IN THIS BED.

27:32.208 --> 27:33.959
YOUR DAD'S RACING BETWEEN ME

27:34.000 --> 27:35.291
AND YOUR BABY SISTER
IN THE NICU.

27:35.333 --> 27:38.083
AND INSTEAD OF BEING HELPFUL,
YOU'RE JUST ACTING OUT.

27:38.125 --> 27:40.083
WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG
WITH YOU?
ARE YOU FINISHED?

27:40.125 --> 27:42.667
DON'T YOU GET FRESH WITH ME.

27:45.083 --> 27:46.959
WE STILL HAVE TO DISCUSS
YOUR PUNISHMENT.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.041
DAD ALREADY DID. NO TV
OR VIDEO GAMES FOR A WEEK.

27:50.083 --> 27:51.792
NOT A WEEK. A MONTH.

27:51.834 --> 27:55.208
AND YOU WILL APOLOGIZE TO NEAL
AND TO HIS PARENTS.

27:55.250 --> 27:58.166
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
WELL, LIFE ISN'T FAIR.
GET USED TO IT.

27:58.208 --> 28:00.291
I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU!

28:00.333 --> 28:01.959

28:02.000 --> 28:05.208

28:05.250 --> 28:07.333

28:11.000 --> 28:13.375

WHAT'S GOING ON?

28:13.417 --> 28:14.750
WELL, SATs ARE DROPPING.

28:14.792 --> 28:16.041
B.P. AND HEART RATE
ARE UNSTABLE.

28:16.083 --> 28:18.208
WHAT'S HER CHEST X-RAY
LOOK LIKE?

28:18.250 --> 28:19.250
WORSE. DIFFUSE INFILTRATE.

28:19.291 --> 28:21.041
I HAVEN'T TOLD COOPER YET.

28:21.083 --> 28:22.458
I WANT TO PRESENT HIM
WITH ALL THE OPTIONS.

28:22.500 --> 28:25.333
IF WE OXYGENATE THE BLOOD
OUTSIDE THE BODY,

28:25.375 --> 28:26.417
THERE'S A CHANCE THAT--

28:26.458 --> 28:28.125
NO. ECMO's TOO DANGEROUS
AND INVASIVE.

28:28.166 --> 28:30.041
WELL, THEN WHAT OTHER OPTION
DO WE HAVE?

28:30.083 --> 28:31.834
I DON'T KNOW, BUT ECMO YOU CAN'T
EVEN DO UNTIL 34 WEEKS.

28:31.875 --> 28:33.041
SHE'S STILL TOO YOUNG.

28:33.083 --> 28:34.417
PLUS, THERE'S NO GUARANTEE
OF SURVIVAL,

28:34.458 --> 28:36.750
AND THEN YOU RUN THE RISK

28:36.792 --> 28:38.875
OF BLEEDING, INFECTION,
CLOTTING, STROKES.

28:38.917 --> 28:40.542
WELL, PNEUMONIA PRESENTS
JUST AS BIG A THREAT.

28:40.583 --> 28:42.375
THE ECTOPIA CORDIS
AND THE PREMATURITY--

28:42.417 --> 28:44.166
I MEAN, SHE'S--

28:44.208 --> 28:45.250
SHE'S ALREADY LOOKING
AT SUCH A HARD LIFE.

28:45.291 --> 28:47.083
I-I JUST...

28:47.125 --> 28:48.417
I DON'T KNOW IF SUCH
AN AGGRESSIVE APPROACH

28:48.458 --> 28:49.583
IS WHAT'S BEST FOR HER.

28:49.625 --> 28:51.083
WELL, IT'S NOT FOR HER.

28:51.125 --> 28:53.208
WE'D BE DOING THIS
FOR COOPER AND CHARLOTTE.

28:53.250 --> 28:54.709
DO WHAT FOR US?

28:57.834 --> 29:01.083
IT'S A LONG SHOT,
BUT...

29:01.125 --> 29:04.458
THEY THINK THAT ECMO IS
OUR BEST OPTION.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.375
HOW LONG WOULD SHE BE
ON BYPASS?

29:06.417 --> 29:09.041
A WEEK.

29:09.083 --> 29:10.291
AND BLOOD THINNERS.

29:10.333 --> 29:11.667
SO AMELIA WOULD DO
AN ULTRASOUND

29:11.709 --> 29:14.208
EVERY DAY TO MAKE SURE
THERE'S NOT A BRAIN BLEED.

29:14.250 --> 29:16.166
AND IF THE ECMO
DOESN'T WORK?

29:16.208 --> 29:19.750
WELL, THEN OUR--OUR DAUGHTER
WILL DIE.

29:23.917 --> 29:25.417
(sighs)

29:25.458 --> 29:30.208
I THOUGHT WE'D HAVE THIS MAGICAL
FIRST CHRISTMAS WITH MASON.

29:30.250 --> 29:33.083
MM, BUY THE BIGGEST TREE
ON THE LOT,

29:33.125 --> 29:35.333
DRINK HOT CHOCOLATE,

29:35.375 --> 29:37.458
LIE AROUND IN OUR P.J.s
ON CHRISTMAS MORNING,

29:37.500 --> 29:41.959
COME UP WITH NAMES
FOR OUR GIRLS.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.917
JUST BE A FAMILY.

29:45.792 --> 29:47.375
BUT NOW?

29:49.291 --> 29:50.500
I KNOW.

29:50.542 --> 29:53.125
NO, YOU DON'T.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.000
(inhales and exhales deeply)

29:56.500 --> 29:59.375
YOU'VE HELD HER

29:59.417 --> 30:01.166
AND YOU'VE KISSED HER HEAD

30:01.208 --> 30:04.166
AND YOU'VE TALKED TO HER.

30:04.208 --> 30:05.834
SHE KNOWS HER DADDY.

30:08.083 --> 30:09.500
BUT ME?

30:11.417 --> 30:14.792
OUR DAUGHTER MAY DIE BEFORE
I EVER GET TO MEET HER.

IT'S GOOD. IT'S REALLY GOOD.

37:15.083 --> 37:16.709
ALL RIGHT.
I SHOULD GET BACK.
(bell chimes)

37:16.750 --> 37:19.500
NO. WAIT. TELL ME MORE.
I WANT TO KNOW MORE.

37:19.542 --> 37:22.875
OKAY. UH, WELL, SHE'S GONNA
GET STRONGER EVERY DAY.
(clicking, bell chiming)

37:22.917 --> 37:25.208
WE'RE BACK TO THIS AGAIN?
I KNOW SHE'S PREGNANT,

37:25.250 --> 37:26.583
BUT JUST LET ME JUST GET
ONE GOOD SMACK IN.

37:26.625 --> 37:28.041
(laughs)
NOW CALM DOWN.

37:28.083 --> 37:32.000
THIS IS A WOMAN WORTH FIGHTING
FOR, AND I HATE MOST OF 'EM.

37:32.041 --> 37:34.500
YOU'D BE A FOOL TO LET HER
GET AWAY, SO MAN UP.

37:34.542 --> 37:36.083
OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT? ENOUGH.

37:36.125 --> 37:38.041
NOW THIS IS NONE
OF YOUR DAMN BUSINESS.

37:38.083 --> 37:39.625
I AM A GROWN MAN.

37:39.667 --> 37:42.208
I WILL CHOOSE
WHO I WANT TO BE WITH.

37:45.667 --> 37:47.041
I CHOOSE YOU.

37:47.083 --> 37:49.917
NOW I DIDN'T TELL YOU
EVERYTHING BEFORE

37:49.959 --> 37:51.709
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THAT YOU'D RUN.

37:53.375 --> 37:55.542
AND I WON'T MAKE
THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.

38:02.417 --> 38:03.875
(indistinct conversations)

38:03.917 --> 38:06.875
SO YOU'VE NEVER BOUGHT
A CHRISTMAS TREE?

38:06.917 --> 38:09.041
NO, I'M JEWISH.

38:09.083 --> 38:11.500
YOU GOTTA HELP ME PICK OUT
THE RIGHT ONE, OKAY?

38:11.542 --> 38:13.834
WHAT SIZE?

38:13.875 --> 38:14.917
BIG.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.875
LIKE, HOW BIG?

38:16.917 --> 38:18.583
LIKE, CRAZY BIG.

38:18.625 --> 38:22.000
(woman) OKAY, YOU GUYS.
SLOW DOWN.

38:22.041 --> 38:22.792
(speaks indistinctly)

38:22.834 --> 38:25.041
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

38:25.083 --> 38:27.125
PERFECT.

38:27.166 --> 38:28.333
ALL RIGHT,
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

38:28.375 --> 38:30.000
WE GET A TRUCKLOAD
OF ORNAMENTS, RIGHT?

38:30.041 --> 38:32.083
AND THEN WE HANG ENOUGH LIGHTS
TO DOUBLE OUR ELECTRIC BILL.

38:32.125 --> 38:34.333
WE PUT IT IN THE LIVING ROOM
SO IT'S ALL SET UP

38:34.375 --> 38:36.083
FOR WHEN MAMA COMES HOME.

38:36.125 --> 38:38.000
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO?

38:38.041 --> 38:39.792
WELL, YEAH, BUT...

38:39.834 --> 38:41.917
IT DOESN'T GO
IN THE LIVING ROOM.

38:41.959 --> 38:44.000
(indistinct conversations
continue)

38:46.834 --> 38:48.709
(people speaking indistinctly)

38:48.750 --> 38:50.208
DR. KING?

38:51.834 --> 38:53.917
WELL...

38:53.959 --> 38:57.000
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SOME SORT
OF A THANK-YOU.

38:57.041 --> 38:58.083
THIS WILL DO.

38:58.125 --> 39:00.709
OH, PLEASE. YOU SHOULD
BE GIVING ME FLOWERS

39:00.750 --> 39:02.792
AND GIFT CERTIFICATES
FOR MASSAGES

39:02.834 --> 39:05.959
AND DEPARTMENT STORES AND STUFF
FOR MY HOUSE.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.375
THESE ARE FROM THE BOARD.

39:07.417 --> 39:09.375
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
BOUGHT ME FLOWERS?

39:09.417 --> 39:11.542
I CAN'T IMAGINE
IT'S BECAUSE THEY LIKE YOU,

39:11.583 --> 39:14.125
SO THEY MUST
REALLY BE SCARED OF YOU.

39:17.417 --> 39:18.917
WHAT THE--

39:18.959 --> 39:20.583
(laughs) HOW DID YOU GET THIS
PAST SECURITY?

39:20.625 --> 39:21.917
I TOLD THEM IT WAS
FOR THE CHIEF OF STAFF.

39:21.959 --> 39:23.041
SANTA SAYS YOU'VE BEEN

39:23.083 --> 39:24.959

39:25.000 --> 39:26.250
(lowered voice) ALTHOUGH
I LIKE IT WHEN YOU'RE BAD,

39:26.291 --> 39:27.875
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE WEARING
CHERRY RED LIPSTICK.

39:27.917 --> 39:29.959
BUT IT'S
NOT EVEN CHRISTMAS YET.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.208
THAT'S THE BEST PART. WE GET
TO HAVE TWO CHRISTMASES.

39:32.250 --> 39:34.458
I KNOW IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT
YOU HAD IN MIND, BUT...

39:34.500 --> 39:36.583
THANK YOU, COOP.
