00:01.090 --> 00:02.120
<i>There are two kinds of folks</i>

00:02.130 --> 00:03.540
<i>who sit around thinking
about how to kill people</i>

00:03.550 --> 00:05.530
<i>psychopaths and mystery writers.</i>

00:05.780 --> 00:07.190
<i>I'm the kind that pays better.</i>

00:07.200 --> 00:08.730
<i>Who am I?</i> 
- I'm Rick Castle.

00:08.740 --> 00:09.830
Castle. Castle.

00:09.840 --> 00:11.950
I really am ruggedly
handsome, aren't I?

00:11.960 --> 00:14.360
<i>Every writer needs inspiration,
and I've found mine.</i>

00:14.370 --> 00:15.340
I'm Detective Kate Beckett.

00:15.350 --> 00:16.329
Beckett.

00:16.890 --> 00:18.990
- Beckett?
- Could you get some backup, please?

00:19.380 --> 00:20.990
<i>And thanks to my
friendship with the mayor,</i>

00:21.040 --> 00:22.550
<i>- I get to be on her case.</i> 
- Oh!

00:22.560 --> 00:24.120
Do I look like a killer to you?

00:24.610 --> 00:25.680
Yes, you kill my patience.

00:25.690 --> 00:27.120
<i>And together, we catch killers.</i>

00:27.780 --> 00:30.570
- I hate this case.
- I know. Isn't it great?

00:40.170 --> 00:40.710
Whoa!

00:43.350 --> 00:44.510
Oh, dude.

00:46.260 --> 00:47.160
Oh!

00:50.280 --> 00:51.230
Dude.

00:53.250 --> 00:54.200
Dude.

00:57.320 --> 00:58.920
Aw. Science project?

00:59.120 --> 01:00.190
No, it's a pet.

01:00.690 --> 01:01.660
Say hello to Theodore, dad.

01:02.180 --> 01:04.510
I'm rat-sitting him for Ashley.
Hello, Theodore.

01:04.989 --> 01:06.269
How goes the rat race?
Did you know

01:06.270 --> 01:08.550
the average life span of a
rat is two to three years?

01:09.210 --> 01:10.530
Ashley's had Theodore for five.

01:11.060 --> 01:12.730
And this is the first time
he's left him with anyone.

01:13.250 --> 01:14.900
Trusting you with
a treasured pet...

01:16.190 --> 01:19.420
That's a big step in a relationship.
Yeah, I guess it kind of is.

01:19.850 --> 01:21.949
I must say,
the little plague pusher

01:21.950 --> 01:23.940
is not very diligent
about his exercise.

01:24.530 --> 01:27.610
I don't know. I-I think it's
just those beady little eyes.

01:27.950 --> 01:30.440
It's a rat, mother.
They all have beady eyes.

01:30.560 --> 01:32.210
That's where the
phrase comes from. Mm.

01:32.220 --> 01:34.729
Dad, those are for Theodore.
He has a very specific diet

01:34.730 --> 01:36.879
I'm supposed to follow.
Well, unless he's Ben,

01:36.880 --> 01:37.990
I'm sure he won't
hold it against me.

01:38.900 --> 01:41.190
If anyone needs me, I'll be in
the park with a dead body. Ah.

01:44.090 --> 01:44.990
Who's Ben?

01:45.190 --> 01:47.110
Killer rat movie.
Before your time.

01:52.150 --> 01:54.279
You know, I understand
ferrets as a pet...

01:54.280 --> 01:56.610
Snakes, spiders, even a hairless mole.
But a rat?

01:56.810 --> 01:59.110
Probably kids in this city
who keep cockroaches as pets.

01:59.390 --> 02:00.260
You're probably right.

02:01.330 --> 02:02.500
What's the strangest
pet you've ever had?

02:02.810 --> 02:04.520
You. Hey, Lanie.

02:06.010 --> 02:07.100
What's this, a hit-and-run?

02:07.380 --> 02:08.570
In a manner of speaking.

02:08.680 --> 02:12.400
Two BMX bikers rode over the body,
then called it in.

02:12.790 --> 02:15.060
But the cause of death
are the gunshot wounds...

02:15.200 --> 02:16.240
One to the chest,

02:16.910 --> 02:18.700
and two more in the back.

02:19.330 --> 02:20.720
So he's wounded on both sides?

02:20.950 --> 02:23.160
Maybe there were two shooters,
he was caught in the cross fire?

02:23.490 --> 02:26.690
Won't know till I get him back
to the lab. You got an I.D.?

02:27.070 --> 02:29.900
Leonard Levitt,
Ozone Park, Queens.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.600
Wallet, cash, keys-
everything still here.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.690
Which means it wasn't theft.
No.

02:37.150 --> 02:38.560
Something much more nefarious.

02:40.840 --> 02:41.740
A feather.

02:43.990 --> 02:45.660
Alternating stripes,
uniform color...

02:49.640 --> 02:51.260
This is no ordinary
pigeon feather.

02:51.460 --> 02:54.210
This... this is
from a bird of prey.

02:54.770 --> 02:56.590
So what are you suggesting,
Castle,

02:56.740 --> 02:57.990
that a bird shot him three times?

02:58.470 --> 02:59.500
Not just any bird.

03:00.130 --> 03:01.629
This is the calling
card of a murderer

03:01.630 --> 03:04.570
known only as...
The Falcon killer.

03:05.920 --> 03:08.390
Or maybe before getting shot,

03:08.460 --> 03:10.240
he just bent down and
picked up the feather.

03:10.470 --> 03:12.640
See, that's why you'll never
be a best-selling novelist.

03:13.050 --> 03:14.080
No sense of drama.

03:14.870 --> 03:17.230
I find that dead bodies
are usually enough.

03:18.380 --> 03:19.660
Thanks, Lanie.
Mm-hmm.

03:21.660 --> 03:24.750
Yo. So we ran background on your vic.
It's pretty thin.

03:25.390 --> 03:26.889
He was a New York
city transit employee.

03:26.890 --> 03:29.090
Worked in the subway out of
the 116th street station.

03:29.390 --> 03:31.330
He worked uptown and
he lived in Queens?

03:32.470 --> 03:33.890
Then what was he
doing in the park?

03:33.891 --> 03:34.800
That's pretty out of the way.

03:35.250 --> 03:36.619
Well, we thought that
he was looking to buy

03:36.620 --> 03:39.300
some weed or some love,
but he has no drug history,

03:39.690 --> 03:41.939
no convictions of
solicitations, no nothing.

03:41.940 --> 03:42.750
And what about his family?

03:42.940 --> 03:44.929
Both parents are deceased.
Guy never married,

03:44.930 --> 03:46.650
has no children.
It's like he barely existed.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.400
Making him the perfect victim.

03:48.570 --> 03:50.080
Mild-mannered city employee

03:50.170 --> 03:52.710
lured into a
conveniently wooded area,

03:53.470 --> 03:54.729
struck down by a murderer

03:54.730 --> 03:56.690
with the speed and cunning
of a bird of prey.

03:57.970 --> 03:59.909
Don't ask. You guys
go to his apartment.

03:59.910 --> 04:01.800
Find out who he is and what he
was doing in the park. Right.

04:03.140 --> 04:06.930
Lividity and temperature puts
time of death between 5:00 and 7:00 P.M.

04:07.460 --> 04:09.420
The victim also has
a broken wrist.

04:09.970 --> 04:11.899
Could be postmortem
from those BMX-ers

04:11.900 --> 04:13.610
playing X games on his corpse.

04:13.980 --> 04:16.358
What about the gunshot wounds?
Al three entry wounds

04:16.360 --> 04:18.480
were made by the
same weapon... A .45.

04:19.060 --> 04:20.079
There was only one shooter.

04:20.220 --> 04:22.179
So the same person
shot him in the front,

04:22.180 --> 04:23.540
and then shot him in the back?

04:23.680 --> 04:25.040
Didn't make any
sense to me either,

04:25.110 --> 04:26.960
so I decided to take
some measurements.

04:28.250 --> 04:31.080
Turns out, the wounds
are of different depths.

04:31.690 --> 04:33.930
The one on his chest
is very shallow,

04:33.940 --> 04:35.880
indicating the shot
came from a distance.

04:35.881 --> 04:37.670
How far? About 150 feet.

04:37.710 --> 04:40.100
That's quite an accurate
shot with a handgun.

04:40.220 --> 04:43.060
Mm. Yeah, I'd say your killer
had some shooting experience.

04:43.150 --> 04:46.230
But the next two shots in
the back were close range,

04:46.890 --> 04:48.450
inside 6 feet, maybe.

04:48.610 --> 04:50.979
So he got shot in the
chest at long range,

04:50.980 --> 04:53.670
turned around to run...
But he's wounded.

04:54.140 --> 04:56.080
The killer goes after him
to finish what he started

04:56.160 --> 04:56.980
with a double tap to the back.

04:57.380 --> 05:01.260
He wasn't just shot.
He was hunted down and killed.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.260
But why?

05:11.860 --> 05:12.760
Whoa.

05:14.740 --> 05:16.670
What was this guy up to?
No idea.

05:22.450 --> 05:24.950
What about that?
Looks like some sort of counter.

05:25.290 --> 05:27.100
What do you think he was
counting? Nothing good.

05:28.700 --> 05:32.619
Night vision, spotting scope,
parabolic microphone...

05:32.620 --> 05:33.810
Top quality, too.

05:34.030 --> 05:36.770
What's a subway worker doing
with all this? I don't know.

05:37.810 --> 05:40.590
But whatever he was into, it had
something to do with the park. Look.

05:41.930 --> 05:43.150
This is right where
his body was found.

05:43.380 --> 05:45.400
5:26... That's around
our time of death.

05:46.860 --> 05:49.149
Looks like he was tracking
something or someone

05:49.150 --> 05:50.210
with the initials B.H.S.

05:50.940 --> 05:52.890
And it looks like that
someone found him.

05:56.830 --> 05:59.650
Surveillance equipment,
clandestine meetings,

05:59.710 --> 06:03.349
a professional hit...
Mix in the subway, and we're looking at

06:03.350 --> 06:06.300
"The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3,"
or better yet, "Money Train."

06:07.560 --> 06:10.210
Any one of these people could
be a secret accomplice.

06:10.310 --> 06:11.249
That's what I love
about the subway.

06:11.250 --> 06:13.109
Down here, everyone's
got a story. See,

06:13.110 --> 06:14.939
that's the difference
between you and me, Castle.

06:14.940 --> 06:17.509
You see the subway as a
place to pick up dialogue

06:17.510 --> 06:18.529
for your novels. Or the

06:18.530 --> 06:20.570
occasional investment banker
on her way to the gym.

06:21.380 --> 06:23.309
I, on the other hand,
see it as a way of getting

06:23.310 --> 06:24.840
from point "A" to point "B."

06:27.920 --> 06:29.920
So Lightbulb Len's dead, huh?

06:30.550 --> 06:33.339
Lightbulb Len? Yeah, it was his
job to change the lightbulbs

06:33.340 --> 06:35.300
in the stations and
tunnels all over New York.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.820
I figured something was wrong.

06:36.900 --> 06:38.940
It's the first time he's
missed work in 22 years.

06:39.460 --> 06:42.280
Mr. Rivera, Len was found
shot to death in the park.

06:42.420 --> 06:43.670
Any idea what he was doing there?

06:43.960 --> 06:46.050
The guy changed
lightbulbs for a living.

06:46.100 --> 06:48.690
You know, a job like that,
it's not for the social.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.679
I mean, in the 12 years
I was his supervisor,

06:51.680 --> 06:54.290
I don't think we ever had
one personal conversation.

06:54.950 --> 06:57.100
But you know who you
should talk to? Who?

06:58.300 --> 06:59.380
Mr. Sansone?

07:01.870 --> 07:02.790
Arthur!

07:06.490 --> 07:07.590
I'm sorry. It's just...

07:08.860 --> 07:10.500
Why would anybody
want to shoot him?

07:11.090 --> 07:12.990
Well, we were hoping that
you could tell us that.

07:13.810 --> 07:16.390
Well, the guy was one of the
unsung heroes of this city.

07:16.980 --> 07:17.950
He saved a lot of lives.

07:18.740 --> 07:20.939
I'm sorry. I thought...
I thought he changed lightbulbs.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.070
Bad things happen in darkness,
Mr. Castle,

07:24.170 --> 07:25.210
dimly lit tunnels,

07:26.120 --> 07:27.200
darkened stairwells.

07:28.060 --> 07:30.600
If Len heard about a blown
bulb before shift end,

07:30.890 --> 07:33.490
he would stay late,
on his own time, to fix it.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.639
And of course,
there was his response

07:35.640 --> 07:37.340
to the Abe Lipschitz tragedy.

07:39.780 --> 07:40.610
1989...

07:41.670 --> 07:44.630
An electrocution of a bulb changer
at the Brighton Beach station.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.360
This is a circuit
interrupter switch.

07:51.740 --> 07:53.910
Shuts down all of the
power inside a tunnel

07:54.230 --> 07:56.840
so that electrical maintenance
could be performed safely.

07:59.990 --> 08:02.980
Down here...
It's called the Lenny Box...

08:03.310 --> 08:07.000
Because it took a visionary
like Len Levitt to design it

08:07.140 --> 08:10.279
and force the transit authority
to install one in every station

08:10.280 --> 08:12.599
in this city.
What about high-tech gear?

08:12.600 --> 08:16.130
Did Lenny ever use any night vision
or microphones for his work?

08:16.710 --> 08:17.500
No. Why?

08:17.770 --> 08:21.250
How about the initials B.H.S.? 
Does that mean anything to you?

08:21.810 --> 08:24.840
Maybe someone or something
that Len was keeping tabs on.

08:25.530 --> 08:27.559
The only thing Len
Levitt ever kept tabs on

08:27.560 --> 08:29.410
was every single
bulb he ever changed.

08:30.080 --> 08:31.990
Did he have any enemies
that you know of?

08:32.590 --> 08:34.809
You don't make waves without
making a few enemies.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.828
Because of Len, we're in the
middle of a systemwide changeover

08:37.830 --> 08:40.309
from incandescent to
compact fluorescents.

08:40.440 --> 08:41.850
New technology comes in,

08:42.380 --> 08:44.980
the city ends up with a
warehouse full of old bulbs.

08:45.230 --> 08:46.899
That makes some guy in a suit

08:46.900 --> 08:49.060
at the old bulb
factory very unhappy.

08:50.080 --> 08:53.400
You ask me, corporations
conspired to take Lenny out.

08:55.580 --> 08:57.599
"'Lenny Box.
'" So the guy's an inventor?

08:57.600 --> 08:59.480
Apparently he was an
underground renaissance man.

09:00.190 --> 09:01.630
Guess that explains
all the electronics.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.000
And the counter in his apartment...

09:03.140 --> 09:04.600
All the lightbulbs he changed.

09:04.820 --> 09:07.120
Seriously, this guy changed
over a million lightbulbs?

09:07.210 --> 09:09.259
The man was an unsung hero,
all right?

09:09.260 --> 09:12.610
Cut down by the forces
of Big Bulb. Big Bulb?

09:13.040 --> 09:14.280
The filament-industrial complex.

09:14.330 --> 09:16.789
Lenny's buddy is delusional
if he actually thinks

09:16.790 --> 09:19.120
that Lenny was killed by
a lightbulb conspiracy.

09:19.480 --> 09:22.690
Well, I wouldn't dismiss our
subterranean friend just yet.

09:22.840 --> 09:23.839
I was running through
Len's phone records,

09:23.840 --> 09:27.409
and one jumped out.
The outgoing call

09:27.410 --> 09:29.250
to the New York city
employee tip line?

09:29.360 --> 09:30.980
It's where you call to
rat out your coworkers.

09:31.050 --> 09:32.840
Must "rat" always be
used in the pejorative?

09:32.940 --> 09:35.420
In the Chinese zodiac, the rat is ac...
What was the tip?

09:35.520 --> 09:37.470
Well, all those incandescent
bulbs they were replacing?

09:37.560 --> 09:40.159
Levitt claims that he had
evidence his supervisor was

09:40.160 --> 09:42.290
stealing them and then reselling
them on the black market.

09:42.550 --> 09:45.139
You mean Mario Rivera? The same.
The charges pan out,

09:45.140 --> 09:46.830
the guy could lose his
job and his pension.

09:47.190 --> 09:49.550
Oh, and get this, before he
was in the transit authority,

09:49.670 --> 09:51.489
Mario was in the marine
corps for eight years

09:51.490 --> 09:53.800
where he won a weapons
medal for sharpshooting.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.120
Where were you last night
between 5:00 and 7:00 P.M.?

10:05.260 --> 10:08.470
Working. We checked.
You clocked out at 4:34.

10:08.610 --> 10:12.590
You, uh, hop the B or the
D down to 59th street.

10:12.610 --> 10:14.210
The express only takes,
what, ten minutes?

10:14.350 --> 10:16.860
Plenty of time to get to the park, kill Len.
Why would I kill Len?

10:17.540 --> 10:18.709
Because he filed a
report against you

10:18.710 --> 10:21.200
with the transit authority when
he found out about Costa Rica.

10:21.430 --> 10:23.000
What the hell are you
guys talking about?

10:24.540 --> 10:26.100
These are e-mails that
were sent from you

10:27.100 --> 10:28.590
to your contact in Costa Rica.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.020
These are my private e-mails.

10:34.090 --> 10:36.750
Sent from a workplace computer,
which means we can look.

10:36.810 --> 10:39.260
So I was thinking about
taking a vacation down there.

10:39.370 --> 10:43.060
Yeah, drink a few cervezas, maybe
go parasailing on the beach,

10:43.690 --> 10:45.200
sell some lightbulbs
to some locals.

10:46.290 --> 10:49.209
The city has a warehouse full
of old, incandescent lightbulbs

10:49.210 --> 10:50.389
that you figured
no one would miss,

10:50.390 --> 10:53.210
so you sold them to a
wholesaler in Costa Rica

10:53.280 --> 10:56.210
for 20 cents a pop.
That's 100 grand.

10:56.840 --> 10:57.940
Only someone did miss them.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.740
Someone with the word
"lightbulb" in his name.

11:01.520 --> 11:03.020
When you found out
Len was on to you,

11:03.660 --> 11:05.720
you realized you could lose
your job and your pension.

11:05.780 --> 11:07.769
You couldn't afford to let him
go to the transit authority

11:07.770 --> 11:08.730
with what he knew.

11:09.680 --> 11:12.199
I didn't kill nobody. Well,
then why don't you just come clean

11:12.200 --> 11:14.090
with what you did last night
between 5:00 and 7:00?

11:15.430 --> 11:16.730
The thing about murderers, Mario,

11:16.731 --> 11:19.170
is they tend to not
have solid alibis.

11:19.280 --> 11:21.340
Generally because they're
murdering somebody.

11:24.220 --> 11:25.120
Look...

11:25.460 --> 11:28.089
Those old lightbulbs were
just gonna get destroyed

11:28.090 --> 11:29.510
and end up in a landfill.

11:29.690 --> 11:31.190
I was doing the city a favor.

11:31.670 --> 11:33.870
So I make a little extra.
So who gets hurt?

11:34.290 --> 11:36.220
Uh... I'm gonna go with Len.

11:38.140 --> 11:39.040
Last chance, Mario.

11:43.980 --> 11:46.039
After work, I went up to
the grand concourse

11:46.040 --> 11:47.730
to pack up a shipment
of lightbulbs.

11:49.410 --> 11:51.190
They went out to Costa
Rica last night.

11:52.650 --> 11:54.700
You can check.
I was there.

11:56.000 --> 11:56.900
Thanks.

11:57.960 --> 12:00.270
He's telling the truth.
Len's call to the tip line?

12:00.690 --> 12:01.869
Turns out that the transit cops

12:01.870 --> 12:03.480
had him under surveillance
all last week.

12:03.550 --> 12:04.679
His tail has him in the Bronx

12:04.680 --> 12:06.849
last night just like he said.
Call the transit cops

12:06.850 --> 12:09.100
and tell them that we just closed
their case for them. Right.

12:10.930 --> 12:13.629
So if lightbulbs didn't get
Lenny killed, then what did?

12:13.630 --> 12:15.690
You know, it can't be a
coincidence that he was killed

12:15.970 --> 12:18.640
right there at about the same
time that he has written down.

12:19.290 --> 12:22.190
And what does "B.H.S." stand for?
Bronx high school?

12:22.900 --> 12:24.860
Hmm. Big honkin' stereo?

12:25.970 --> 12:28.130
Boys have shoes?
Try Byron H. Singer.

12:28.690 --> 12:30.629
I found a small vendor
decal on the side

12:30.630 --> 12:32.760
of the parabolic microphone
we found in his apartment,

12:32.910 --> 12:34.679
so I called the vendor
to find out if he knew

12:34.680 --> 12:36.180
why Len bought the equipment.

12:36.290 --> 12:37.810
Turns out,
Len didn't buy it at all.

12:38.220 --> 12:40.929
It was purchased two months
ago by an insurance actuary

12:40.930 --> 12:44.130
named Byron H. Singer.
B.H.S.!

12:45.480 --> 12:46.380
Sorry.

12:48.590 --> 12:49.910
Mr. Singer,
thank you for coming down.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.230
They said it was important.

12:52.950 --> 12:54.410
Do you know a man
named Len Levitt?

12:55.480 --> 12:58.750
What did that bastard tell you?
He didn't tell us anything.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.080
Good, because he's a liar.

13:01.340 --> 13:02.560
He thought he knew better than me.

13:03.110 --> 13:05.629
He thought he knew better
than everybody. Mr. Singer...

13:05.630 --> 13:06.740
I don't care if he
didn't believe me.

13:07.170 --> 13:09.880
I don't care how much it hurt him.
I know what I saw.

13:11.260 --> 13:12.550
And what did you see?

13:12.970 --> 13:14.580
The two of them, together,

13:14.610 --> 13:17.100
in the park,
like a pair of lovebirds.

13:17.770 --> 13:19.940
But he accused me of
making the whole thing up.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.300
I mean, why would I make
something like that up?

13:22.510 --> 13:23.490
Why would anybody?

13:23.550 --> 13:25.760
Mr. Singer, what exactly
did you see in the park?

13:25.890 --> 13:26.910
I saw enough.

13:28.230 --> 13:31.210
And believe me, I was pretty
shocked to see them together.

13:31.570 --> 13:34.340
I knew I had to tell Len
before somebody else did.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.360
Len must have been very
angry when you told him.

13:36.510 --> 13:40.109
Very angry and jealous,
but I had followed them

13:40.110 --> 13:41.630
and found their secret spot.

13:41.940 --> 13:44.290
And I told him where
and when to find them.

13:44.530 --> 13:46.130
I even lent him
some of my equipment

13:46.230 --> 13:47.730
so he could spy on them himself.

13:48.060 --> 13:50.070
So Len goes to the park,
and he sees for himself.

13:50.190 --> 13:52.190
And then he confronts
them in a jealous rage,

13:52.260 --> 13:54.190
and they kill him.
They do what now?

13:54.580 --> 13:55.320
Er.

13:57.730 --> 14:00.040
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

14:01.110 --> 14:03.130
Uh... who did you see
in the park that night?

14:03.540 --> 14:04.450
The red-tailed hawks.

14:05.220 --> 14:08.880
Oh. There haven't been a nesting
pair in the park for 40 years.

14:09.350 --> 14:11.030
You mean, this is about birds?

14:11.170 --> 14:13.590
Not just birds.
The red-tailed hawks.

14:13.710 --> 14:16.620
Len oversees the log in the
central park boathouse,

14:16.770 --> 14:18.749
where all the sightings
are officially recorded.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.700
But he refused to
acknowledge my sighting.

14:21.080 --> 14:23.060
So I told him,
if he didn't believe me,

14:23.150 --> 14:25.220
he should go out to the
park and see for himself.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.310
They nest at dusk.

14:28.640 --> 14:32.240
Mr. Singer, were you in the park
yesterday between 5:00 and 7:00 P.M.?

14:33.240 --> 14:36.420
Usually I am, but yesterday
I was in my office, working.

14:36.950 --> 14:38.870
And can any of your
colleagues verify that?

14:39.100 --> 14:41.789
I'm sure they can,
but about the hawks...

14:41.790 --> 14:43.390
And I want this on
the official record...

14:43.530 --> 14:47.660
I would never exaggerate or
fabricate a bird sighting.

14:47.770 --> 14:48.810
It's unthinkable.

14:51.300 --> 14:55.110
They're there, and I saw them first.

14:56.790 --> 14:57.990
I'm putting that in
the official record.

14:58.500 --> 15:02.640
So the equipment, the park,
the feather, and B.H.S....

15:02.800 --> 15:04.160
It looks like we've
explained everything.

15:05.270 --> 15:07.150
Yes, except why he was killed.

15:13.060 --> 15:14.610
Morning, mother.
Morning.

15:19.340 --> 15:20.379
So why is gram on the table

15:20.380 --> 15:22.390
and why are you on the floor?
Dad, he's gone.

15:22.490 --> 15:25.639
Theodore? When I fed him his
quinoa salad with wheat berries,

15:25.640 --> 15:27.229
I must not have closed the
cage door all the way,

15:27.230 --> 15:29.159
and now he's gone,
and Ashley's going to hate me.

15:29.160 --> 15:30.499
Oh, he's not gonna hate you.
He'll understand.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.159
No, he won't. He trusted me,

15:32.160 --> 15:34.689
and I let him down.
No, not yet, you haven't.

15:34.690 --> 15:37.049
We'll find him. Have you looked
in your room? And in gram's, too.

15:37.050 --> 15:38.370
If that creature entered my room,

15:38.470 --> 15:40.830
I'm gonna need a new bed...
And wardrobe.

15:40.900 --> 15:43.110
Dad, what if he got out?
Like "out" out?

15:43.360 --> 15:45.010
All right, Theodore
is an uptown rat.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.030
He's here someplace.
Okay, to find a rodent,

15:47.770 --> 15:49.200
you have to think like a rodent.

15:51.020 --> 15:51.970
You are Theodore.

15:53.610 --> 15:55.480
What do you want? Food.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.540
Eh, you got a personal chef.
You're not hungry.

15:58.840 --> 16:01.280
Warmth. I'd want to
stay warm and safe.

16:01.440 --> 16:03.469
Yeah, a cozy, quiet place,
out of the way,

16:03.470 --> 16:05.319
where no one's gonna step on you.
Front hall closet.

16:05.320 --> 16:06.220
Nice.

16:10.580 --> 16:12.610
You see him? No.
He's not here.

16:14.920 --> 16:15.830
He's not here.

16:17.450 --> 16:18.370
What?

16:20.990 --> 16:22.290
You need to go.

16:22.570 --> 16:23.810
And leave you ratless?

16:24.900 --> 16:28.650
It's my responsibility, dad.
Not yours. I'll find him.

16:29.530 --> 16:30.670
Are you sure? 
Yeah.

16:31.540 --> 16:33.530
All right. You call me...
If you need anything.

16:36.600 --> 16:40.040
Just so you know, I'm checking
into the Plaza, and you're paying.

16:44.520 --> 16:47.340
Okay, Castle, I'm here.
What was so important?

16:48.300 --> 16:49.370
Your first clue is...

16:49.990 --> 16:53.410
The curious incident of
the dog in the nighttime.

16:54.120 --> 16:56.420
Oh, jeez, Castle.
I haven't even had my coffee yet.

16:57.780 --> 16:58.490
Thank you.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.869
From the Sherlock Holmes story,
"Silver Blaze."

17:00.870 --> 17:03.320
Holmes unmasks the murderer
because of what didn't happen.

17:03.470 --> 17:06.019
The dog didn't bark.
That's how he knew the dog must

17:06.020 --> 17:08.398
have known the killer. Okay.
Yes, I remember the story.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.150
Then you know that the
hardest form of detection

17:10.750 --> 17:12.329
is looking for the
thing that isn't there.

17:12.609 --> 17:15.599
Byron said that Len was
going to verify the hawks.

17:15.920 --> 17:20.030
Verify, as in "provide proof,"
which means...

17:20.220 --> 17:22.099
He would've had a camera...
Which we didn't find.

17:22.369 --> 17:23.990
And if he was taking pictures...

17:24.079 --> 17:25.560
We should be able to figure
out what he was up to.

17:26.760 --> 17:30.000
We found the body here, where
he took the last two bullets...

17:30.030 --> 17:31.510
Running away from his killer.

17:31.930 --> 17:33.220
He had a broken wrist.

17:33.710 --> 17:36.280
From the BMX guys
riding over his body.

17:36.620 --> 17:37.840
Or he fell from a tree.

17:42.490 --> 17:43.460
This tree.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.020
There's a fresh divot.

17:51.230 --> 17:52.530
It's all birds.

17:52.650 --> 17:54.710
Mm. Red-tailed hawks.

17:55.480 --> 17:57.200
Looks like Byron Singer was
telling the truth after all.

17:57.560 --> 17:59.280
Yeah, remind me to
notify the bird police.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.710
But I doubt it was the
hawks that killed him.

18:03.140 --> 18:04.080
Whoa.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.560
Lightbulb Len witnessed
a child abduction.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.720
And the last thing he
saw was his killer.

18:17.020 --> 18:18.759
We don't know his name or age,

18:18.760 --> 18:21.640
but we're estimating between
10 and 12 years old.

18:21.890 --> 18:24.889
He has brown hair, hazel eyes,
and was last seen

18:24.890 --> 18:28.730
wearing shorts, sneakers,
and a gray and white jacket.

18:29.230 --> 18:34.480
Now our kidnapper is male, brown
hair, between 5'10" and 6".

18:35.160 --> 18:37.340
He was carrying a Glock .45,

18:37.910 --> 18:39.339
which matches the
size of the slugs

18:39.340 --> 18:41.020
that we found in
our victim's body.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.539
Now both photos have
time stamps on them,

18:43.540 --> 18:45.389
so we know that the
abduction took place

18:45.390 --> 18:48.019
at 5:12 P.M. on Tuesday.
After 48 hours,

18:48.020 --> 18:52.450
the chances of finding a child
abduction victim alive go way down.

18:53.180 --> 18:55.660
The only thing that matters
is finding that kid.

19:04.190 --> 19:05.719
If he's been missing for 36 hours,

19:05.720 --> 19:07.930
how come his parents haven't reported it?
They might not know.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.910
Or they might be under duress.

19:11.210 --> 19:12.380
He was wearing shorts,

19:12.790 --> 19:15.200
which probably means he knew
he was going to the park.

19:16.090 --> 19:18.440
Well, if he wasn't lured there,
maybe he knew his kidnapper.

19:18.580 --> 19:20.010
But then why would the
kidnapper need a gun?

19:21.340 --> 19:23.240
I e-mailed the photo to
the New York State Police

19:23.360 --> 19:24.729
and the parole division.
They're looking into

19:24.730 --> 19:26.720
any kidnappers with
this abduction M.O.

19:26.870 --> 19:29.480
And Esposito is canvassing
that part of the park

19:29.650 --> 19:32.410
looking for any witnesses.
Well, what about schools?

19:32.550 --> 19:33.909
If the boy goes to a local school,

19:33.910 --> 19:36.110
they'd know he was absent.
Have uniforms fax his photo

19:36.190 --> 19:37.920
to all schools in the
five boroughs. Done.

19:38.710 --> 19:42.020
That car looks to be, like,
a compact or a subcompact.

19:42.180 --> 19:44.730
Can we get the make or model?
Lab's already looking into it.

19:44.820 --> 19:46.969
We're pulling video from all
traffic cameras on the streets

19:46.970 --> 19:48.740
leading in and out of the
park on Tuesday evening.

19:48.890 --> 19:51.720
Maybe we'll catch a license plate.
Or the driver's face.

19:52.230 --> 19:54.399
What if we were to enlarge
this part of the photo...

19:54.400 --> 19:55.950
Not the face, just this
part of the window?

19:57.580 --> 19:58.659
Are you thinking
of the reflection?

19:58.660 --> 20:00.659
I'm wondering if maybe we
can see the kidnapper's face

20:00.660 --> 20:02.540
in that side view mirror.
It's worth a shot.

20:06.810 --> 20:08.600
I need a C.S.U. photo tech up here now.

20:09.830 --> 20:10.840
You sure you haven't seen him?

20:11.150 --> 20:13.110
Man, I see so many kids every day,

20:13.190 --> 20:16.030
I couldn't tell one from the next.
What about a blue car

20:16.080 --> 20:17.580
around the same time,
somewhere in this area?

20:17.680 --> 20:19.190
Tuesday about 5:00? Yeah.

20:19.350 --> 20:22.840
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
a blue Saturn. You sure?

20:23.390 --> 20:26.879
Yeah. People I forget.
Things that get in my way, I remember.

20:26.880 --> 20:28.420
It was parked right in
front of my regular spot.

20:29.020 --> 20:31.650
Instead, I gotta set up at
the edge of the roadway.

20:31.910 --> 20:34.250
I almost get clipped by a cab.
Anybody inside?

20:34.400 --> 20:36.740
No, because I woulda yelled
at the driver if there was.

20:37.110 --> 20:40.080
I don't know what's wrong with
people in this city. Yeah, thanks.

20:40.450 --> 20:41.350
Yeah.

20:42.580 --> 20:44.770
Our pretzel vendor I.D.'ed
the kidnapper's car

20:44.880 --> 20:48.390
as a blue Saturn sedan,
anywhere from '97 to '02.

20:49.070 --> 20:52.770
The problem is, there are
6,000 blue Saturns registered

20:52.820 --> 20:54.380
in the tristate area alone.

20:56.090 --> 20:58.000
Ryan, where are we
on the traffic cams?

20:58.330 --> 20:59.930
The make and model will
help narrow it down,

21:00.130 --> 21:01.300
but there's a lot of footage.

21:01.450 --> 21:04.599
There's also no central
database for school absences.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.620
We can't sort by grade or gender,

21:06.750 --> 21:10.110
and there's a bad cold
making the rounds,

21:10.270 --> 21:13.360
so more kids are out than usual.
What about state police?

21:13.560 --> 21:15.229
Whole lot of nada,
and nothing popped

21:15.230 --> 21:16.829
on parolees with the
same kidnapping M.O.

21:16.830 --> 21:17.830
Yes, I'll continue to hold.

21:17.920 --> 21:20.410
Detective, enhanced and
enlarged. Thank you.

21:25.130 --> 21:28.239
Oh, the enhancement only increased
the pixilation on all these.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.700
You can't even see there's
a side view mirror.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.680
Well, it's not like on "24", Castle.

21:31.750 --> 21:34.310
In the real world, zoom and
enhance can only get us so far.

21:34.680 --> 21:37.160
Yeah, but you can't even...
There's no reflection. It's just mush.

21:40.490 --> 21:41.770
Are you okay?
Yeah.

21:42.840 --> 21:45.290
No. God, this kid isn't that
much younger than Alexis.

21:47.250 --> 21:48.300
Don't worry. We'll find him.

21:50.790 --> 21:51.700
Alexis.

21:52.940 --> 21:54.800
What? I've seen this before.

21:55.040 --> 21:58.299
You've seen what? This mark on his sock.
Alexis used to get these

21:58.300 --> 21:59.719
when she played soccer.
They're cleat marks from where

21:59.720 --> 22:00.739
other kids kick her in the shin.

22:00.740 --> 22:02.419
If he was playing
soccer in the park,

22:02.420 --> 22:05.079
he might be a part of an
organized team or a league.

22:05.080 --> 22:07.599
And youth leagues have web
sites that you can go to.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.470
The parents and kids can
track scores and standings.

22:09.810 --> 22:10.969
I spoke to the
league commissioner,

22:10.970 --> 22:13.650
and only one 10- to 12-year-old
team practiced on Tuesday...

22:13.810 --> 22:14.890
The Wildcats.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.710
There!
Tyler Donegal.

22:23.320 --> 22:26.170
He's 12. Ryan, let's get
everything we can on this kid.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.540
The clock is ticking,
and we gotta bring him back alive.

22:34.260 --> 22:36.569
Tyler Donegal lives with
his mother in Westchester.

22:36.570 --> 22:38.689
Court records show
that the parents' divorce was

22:38.690 --> 22:40.860
finalized two months ago.
You reach the parents?

22:41.080 --> 22:43.620
Just got off with the mother-
Mirielle Lefcourt.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.199
She moved out of
the city last year.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.860
Got remarried to an
anesthesiologist last month.

22:47.930 --> 22:50.090
She says she has no idea
that her son is missing.

22:50.690 --> 22:52.800
He was spending two days
in the city with her ex.

22:52.970 --> 22:53.920
She's on her way in now.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.369
If the father had custody,
where the hell is he,

22:55.370 --> 22:56.760
and why didn't he
report the boy missing?

22:56.880 --> 22:57.880
We're working on that, sir.

22:58.020 --> 23:00.549
The father's a maintenance
supervisor at High-Rise

23:00.550 --> 23:02.430
on West Broadway and Canal.

23:02.540 --> 23:04.670
He lives six blocks from Central Park.
Yo.

23:05.130 --> 23:07.500
Donegal called in sick for
work yesterday and today.

23:07.690 --> 23:10.750
Divorced parents, one child,
one spouse remarries quickly?

23:10.900 --> 23:12.659
So she dumps the
janitor in the city

23:12.660 --> 23:15.400
for the doctor in the burbs.
All the father has left is his son.

23:17.100 --> 23:19.030
It's got all the hallmarks
of a custodial abduction.

23:21.330 --> 23:22.920
You got a photo?
I'll get one.

23:27.120 --> 23:29.120
Dean Donegal.
5'10", 175...

23:29.740 --> 23:31.570
Brown hair.
Well, the vitals match.

23:31.720 --> 23:34.270
Yeah. Yeah, but why do you need
a gun to kidnap your own son?

23:34.770 --> 23:35.749
You just put him in the car,

23:35.750 --> 23:36.880
tell him you're
going for ice cream.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.640
What's he doing? 
Hey, Beckett, the mother's here.

23:40.230 --> 23:41.909
All right, Ryan,
you go to Dean's office.

23:41.910 --> 23:43.439
Esposito, you check
out his apartment.

23:43.440 --> 23:46.010
Maybe something else is going
on with that family. Right.

23:51.340 --> 23:52.640
Where's my son?

23:52.960 --> 23:55.210
That's what we're trying to
determine, Mrs. Lefcourt.

23:56.150 --> 23:57.990
When was the last time
that you spoke with him?

23:58.330 --> 24:00.710
Uh, two days ago when I dropped
him off at his father's.

24:00.830 --> 24:02.660
He was supposed to be with Dean.
Have you talked to Dean?

24:04.210 --> 24:05.269
We're trying to locate him now.

24:05.270 --> 24:07.200
He's not at work?
He never misses work.

24:08.020 --> 24:09.179
Can you tell me about the divorce?

24:09.180 --> 24:10.330
How did Dean take that?

24:10.920 --> 24:15.050
Um, not well. He was
very bitter and angry.

24:16.110 --> 24:19.340
Does he own a gun?
A handgun.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.250
Yes. There were break-ins
in his building.

24:22.450 --> 24:23.410
Do you know what kind?

24:23.520 --> 24:25.540
Why are you asking
me about a-a gun?

24:25.700 --> 24:27.719
Was somebody shot?
Was my son shot?

24:27.720 --> 24:29.519
No, nobody was shot,
Mrs. Lefcourt.

24:29.520 --> 24:32.580
It's just, the man who took
your son was carrying a gun.

24:33.050 --> 24:35.710
Now I'm gonna have to
show you this photograph.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.060
Do you recognize this man?

24:42.110 --> 24:43.380
I don't know. Is that Dean?

24:43.890 --> 24:45.109
I was hoping that
you could tell me.

24:45.110 --> 24:46.820
What about this car?
Is that his car?

24:47.470 --> 24:50.050
No, Dean doesn't own a car.
He... he rents one as he needs one.

24:51.530 --> 24:55.129
A Glock.
Dean's gun, it's a Glock.

24:55.130 --> 24:57.350
We had to itemize our
property for the divorce.

24:59.210 --> 25:01.569
Mrs. Lefcourt, does Dean have a
place that he likes to take Tyler?

25:01.570 --> 25:03.280
Any, um, favorite hangouts?

25:03.650 --> 25:05.370
No, as far as I know,
he's never taken him anywhere.

25:05.850 --> 25:06.800
That's not true.

25:07.530 --> 25:10.100
Dean's family has a
cabin in the Poconos.

25:12.170 --> 25:14.000
Pennsylvania state police are
on their way to the cabin.

25:14.050 --> 25:15.450
With any luck, we'll find Tyler.

25:17.740 --> 25:18.640
You okay?

25:19.700 --> 25:21.420
I can't imagine how
Tyler's mother feels.

25:22.590 --> 25:23.580
Yeah, me neither.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.730
When Alexis was 4,
we went Christmas shopping

25:27.830 --> 25:29.829
at some mall in... in White Plains.

25:29.830 --> 25:32.690
I was trying on some
charcoal fedora.

25:32.770 --> 25:35.929
I turn around,
she is gone, vanished.

25:35.930 --> 25:39.650
I looked everywhere, so did mall
security, so did the police.

25:39.651 --> 25:41.230
We searched for an hour.

25:42.950 --> 25:44.359
You don't have to be a novelist

25:44.360 --> 25:45.960
to think of all the
worst-case scenarios.

25:47.310 --> 25:48.610
Where'd you find her?

25:49.350 --> 25:52.479
Behind a rack of winter coats.
She got bored.

25:52.480 --> 25:53.920
She crawled underneath
there and went to sleep.

25:56.580 --> 25:58.340
To this day,
I still dream about that.

25:59.580 --> 26:02.140
Just got off with Esposito.
Looks like Dean's on the move.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.899
What did they find?
It's what they didn't find...

26:04.900 --> 26:06.109
No toothbrush, no deodorant,

26:06.110 --> 26:08.309
no shampoo in the shower.
I'll run his credit card

26:08.310 --> 26:09.850
for anything that
indicates he's traveling.

26:11.230 --> 26:12.130
Dean's desk?

26:12.130 --> 26:14.280
You can't miss it,
right? Pictures everywhere.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.090
He calls it Tyler-Palooza.

26:17.320 --> 26:18.540
Is this his only work area?

26:18.730 --> 26:19.680
Yeah. Uh-huh.

26:20.090 --> 26:21.809
How'd he sound when
he called in sick?

26:21.810 --> 26:24.130
Did he sound... stressed?

26:24.530 --> 26:26.720
Tell you the truth, Detective,
Dean didn't call in sick.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.819
I covered for him. Why?

26:28.820 --> 26:30.930
His ex-wife got remarried
to some rich doctor

26:31.020 --> 26:33.000
like five minutes after
the divorce was final.

26:33.320 --> 26:35.310
He had legal bills up the ass.
I figured,

26:35.400 --> 26:37.150
he just needed to spend a
little time with his son.

26:37.640 --> 26:39.320
So what if he didn't call in sick?

26:39.410 --> 26:41.830
I had his back.
That's how we do it down here.

26:41.890 --> 26:43.100
Hey, Teresa!

26:43.530 --> 26:44.540
All right, already.

26:51.700 --> 26:52.600
Whoa.

26:58.210 --> 26:59.180
What's in Indy, Dean?

26:59.510 --> 27:01.510
Maybe he's got family
in Indianapolis...

27:02.350 --> 27:04.210
Someone who can hide him.

27:04.570 --> 27:05.809
Yeah, but there weren't
any airline tickets

27:05.810 --> 27:10.320
purchased in his name or in Tyler's.
Yo, the cabin's empty.

27:10.600 --> 27:11.769
P.A. State Troopers
say it looks like

27:11.770 --> 27:12.930
there hasn't been
anybody there in months.

27:13.250 --> 27:14.950
We just got a hit on Dean
Donegal's financials.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.300
An hour ago, he booked a motel
room in Jamaica, Queens.

27:17.600 --> 27:18.610
That's not far from the airport.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.590
He might still be trying
to get Tyler out of town.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.310
If we're lucky. He shot someone,

27:22.490 --> 27:24.289
he's on the run,
he's under extreme duress.

27:24.290 --> 27:26.490
Let's get him before this
ends bloody for everyone.

27:27.670 --> 27:30.139
NYPD! Tyler!
Tyler, you here?!

27:30.140 --> 27:33.020
Hands! Show me your hands! Tyler!

27:33.230 --> 27:34.870
Bathroom's clear. He's not here.

27:35.780 --> 27:36.710
Where's Tyler?

27:37.360 --> 27:40.539
I don't know. They told
me to check into a motel

27:40.540 --> 27:42.730
and wait for further instructions.
Who did?

27:43.280 --> 27:45.620
I don't know. All I know is,
they took him.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.030
And if I help you,
they'll kill my son.

27:52.780 --> 27:54.110
Where is Tyler, Dean?

27:54.290 --> 27:58.179
I told you, I don't know.
Why were you going to Indianapolis?

27:58.180 --> 28:00.409
Indian... What are
you talking about?

28:00.410 --> 28:01.589
We know you were
checking on airfares.

28:01.590 --> 28:04.350
I was researching a
trip for the holidays.

28:04.620 --> 28:06.540
What, you think I took my own son?

28:06.760 --> 28:08.210
You were in a hotel
by the airport.

28:08.280 --> 28:09.820
That's where they
told me to go. Who?

28:10.030 --> 28:14.080
Please. They said,
if I talk to the cops, he's dead.

28:16.620 --> 28:18.140
Dean, if you're son is in danger,

28:18.210 --> 28:19.380
then you need to tell
us what you know.

28:23.240 --> 28:25.099
I went to pick him
up after practice.

28:25.100 --> 28:26.739
When he wasn't at the usual spot,

28:26.740 --> 28:28.020
I figured he must
have walked home.

28:28.110 --> 28:31.620
When I got back to my apartment,
that phone was on my doormat.

28:31.710 --> 28:32.900
It had a text on it.

28:37.730 --> 28:39.119
"We have your son. Tell no one.

28:39.120 --> 28:40.240
Use only this phone."

28:40.320 --> 28:43.190
Contact the police,
and Tyler dies."

28:45.670 --> 28:48.280
"Stand by. We will tell you
where to go and what to do.

28:48.330 --> 28:50.750
Tell no one. Your son's
life depends on it."

28:54.880 --> 28:57.270
What do they want from you?
I have no idea.

29:00.650 --> 29:02.439
Dean's Glock is a 9 millimeter.

29:02.440 --> 29:03.560
Right make, wrong model.

29:04.460 --> 29:06.110
Lightbulb Len was
killed with a .45.

29:06.680 --> 29:08.720
The SIM card from his
cell phone is a burner,

29:08.850 --> 29:10.880
and the text messages aren't
coming from another phone.

29:10.940 --> 29:12.619
They're coming from an
Internet texting service

29:12.620 --> 29:15.629
based in the Ukraine-
no I.P. Address, untraceable.

29:15.630 --> 29:18.350
Track the SIM. I want a
printout of every text message.

29:18.550 --> 29:19.949
And get the electronic
serial number off that phone.

29:19.950 --> 29:20.899
I want to find out where

29:20.900 --> 29:22.800
it was purchased and by whom.
You got it, sir.

29:22.950 --> 29:23.920
What do they want from you?

29:24.080 --> 29:26.010
Are they after a ransom?
Are you kidding?

29:26.740 --> 29:28.579
I'm 40 grand in debt
after my divorce.

29:28.580 --> 29:29.610
I'm looking up at broke.

29:29.780 --> 29:31.810
What about your ex-wife's
new husband? He has money.

29:32.530 --> 29:34.260
They're not calling him.
They're calling me.

29:34.550 --> 29:37.860
What if they find out I'm here?
I just want my son back.

29:38.070 --> 29:40.100
Then your best option
is to work with us.

29:41.070 --> 29:42.030
Let us help you.

29:44.470 --> 29:45.460
I need to get some air.

29:58.270 --> 29:59.620
Look, I know that this is hard.

30:01.130 --> 30:03.450
But you have to trust us.
We will find him.

30:09.750 --> 30:10.690
Okay.

30:11.970 --> 30:12.970
Don't let 'em hurt my boy.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.690
Where is he? Where is Tyler?

30:16.110 --> 30:17.390
You should've been
there to pick him

30:17.480 --> 30:18.770
up at soccer practice!
We're doing everything we can.

30:18.771 --> 30:19.680
This is why I should've never

30:19.720 --> 30:21.450
agreed to joint custody.
It's gonna be all right.

30:21.480 --> 30:22.810
Stay outta this.
You're not family.

30:22.830 --> 30:24.170
He's my boy, too! Sit down!

30:24.240 --> 30:25.170
That's enough!

30:27.350 --> 30:31.199
Now I need everyone to calm down,
cooperate, and think.

30:31.200 --> 30:33.819
Dean, you notice anyone unusual
hanging around your son,

30:33.820 --> 30:35.600
anything out of the ordinary
going on in his life?

30:36.540 --> 30:39.960
No. I mean, I... I don't think so.

30:40.010 --> 30:41.310
What about you two?

30:42.370 --> 30:43.360
Nothing comes to mind. No.

30:44.570 --> 30:46.030
Now this abduction
was clearly planned.

30:47.030 --> 30:48.930
So the kidnapper had to know
where Tyler was gonna be.

30:50.410 --> 30:52.560
Sir, this is a message.
It's from the kidnapper.

30:53.500 --> 30:54.880
There's a video attached.

30:56.320 --> 30:57.220
Hi, dad.

30:57.740 --> 30:59.210
I know you're worried,
but I'm okay.

31:00.450 --> 31:02.500
They say if you do what they
ask, everything will be fine.

31:03.620 --> 31:04.610
Just don't go to the police.

31:05.620 --> 31:08.340
I'll see you soon, and
don't forget to feed Ace.

31:10.270 --> 31:11.660
Oh, thank God he's alive.

31:12.290 --> 31:14.730
There's a time stamp on it...
1:31 A.M.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.700
That was sent eight minutes ago.

31:16.930 --> 31:17.909
It's a good thing, Mrs. Lefcourt.

31:17.910 --> 31:19.319
It's called a proof of life video.

31:19.320 --> 31:21.070
The kidnapper sent it to
prove your son's alive,

31:21.120 --> 31:23.629
and that you do
exactly what they ask.

31:23.630 --> 31:25.169
Okay. You will do exactly
what they ask you to.

31:25.170 --> 31:27.200
Do you understand? Wait.
Play that last part again.

31:29.750 --> 31:30.820
Don't forget to feed Ace.

31:32.860 --> 31:34.600
Who's Ace? I don't know any Ace.

31:35.140 --> 31:37.400
We don't have any pets.
He's sending us a message.

31:38.110 --> 31:39.070
He's a smart boy.

31:39.350 --> 31:41.850
Uh, Ace could refer to
a person or a business.

31:43.710 --> 31:45.190
Sir, there's another text.

31:46.130 --> 31:48.490
"680 Canal Street. 30 minutes."

31:48.630 --> 31:49.810
That's the building where I work.

31:49.960 --> 31:51.850
What's there,
a jewelry store, a bank?

31:52.050 --> 31:54.670
No, just offices. Well, why you?

31:54.780 --> 31:56.570
What's so special about that
building that they need you?

31:57.110 --> 31:58.080
Uh...

32:00.190 --> 32:01.160
Oh, God.

32:01.300 --> 32:04.930
Because I have elevator access to
all the floors in the building.

32:05.870 --> 32:06.780
You're a human key.

32:08.930 --> 32:10.439
Sir, I just talked to
the building's owner.

32:10.440 --> 32:12.999
He's e-mailing blueprints and
a tenant list for 680 Canal,

32:13.000 --> 32:14.660
including the secure floors.
Ryan and

32:14.730 --> 32:16.680
Esposito are with me.
We'll take Dean to the building.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.359
I've arranged to have an
E.S.U. team standing by

32:18.360 --> 32:21.350
in striking distance. Sir,
you can't take Dean to that building.

32:21.430 --> 32:24.280
It is way too dangerous.
He's a father who loves his son.

32:24.390 --> 32:25.710
You're not gonna be
able to stop him.

32:25.800 --> 32:27.670
And until we find the boy,
we don't have any other choice.

32:28.250 --> 32:29.150
Scrub the video.

32:29.500 --> 32:32.370
Look for anything that could
lead us to him. Yes, sir.

32:44.860 --> 32:46.120
All right. We're a block away.

32:46.730 --> 32:49.750
We'll be able to see and hear
everything that's happening, okay?

32:50.150 --> 32:51.430
And we cloned your phone

32:51.560 --> 32:53.560
so we'll be able to read
your texts in real time.

32:53.710 --> 32:55.730
You follow the kidnapper's
instructions to the letter.

32:55.830 --> 32:58.750
No cowboy stuff,
you understand me? Yes.

32:59.500 --> 33:00.440
Hi, dad.

33:00.980 --> 33:02.410
I know you're worried,
but I'm okay.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.700
They say if you do what they ask,
everything will be fine.

33:06.720 --> 33:07.950
Just don't go to the police.

33:08.780 --> 33:11.380
I'll see you soon,
and don't forget to feed Ace.

33:13.030 --> 33:15.029
There are no identifying
markers in the background.

33:15.030 --> 33:16.020
It's all black.

33:17.710 --> 33:19.070
I don't know if we're
gonna find him in time.

33:20.420 --> 33:22.460
The video was taken at 1:31 A.M.

33:22.840 --> 33:24.800
But they didn't send it till 1:39.

33:25.820 --> 33:26.979
Yeah, well,
sometimes it takes a while

33:26.980 --> 33:29.320
for a text to go through.
Yeah, but eight minutes?

33:31.690 --> 33:33.050
You want Dean to do
something for you.

33:33.310 --> 33:34.450
You make a proof of life video.

33:34.860 --> 33:36.900
But you wait eight
minutes to send it. Why?

33:37.230 --> 33:39.970
Well, maybe there wasn't a
signal or not enough bars.

33:40.920 --> 33:44.919
Yeah. Maybe they had to walk
a long way to get a signal.

33:44.920 --> 33:46.110
Maybe they were under a...

33:49.080 --> 33:49.960
Underground.

33:50.870 --> 33:52.390
"Ace.
" It's not "Ace."

33:53.160 --> 33:54.100
It's A-C-E...

33:55.200 --> 33:56.680
The A, C, and E subway lines.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.769
They're holding
Tyler in the subway.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.420
He must have spotted a sign.

34:00.840 --> 34:02.939
There's half a dozen stations
where the A, C, and E stop.

34:02.940 --> 34:03.620
That's too many to search.

34:04.260 --> 34:06.390
Yeah, but the last stop
for all three lines

34:06.460 --> 34:08.500
is on Canal Street
and West Broadway.

34:08.550 --> 34:09.739
That's...
Right under Dean's building.

34:09.739 --> 34:11.949
They've been holding him under
everyone's nose. Let's go.

34:19.570 --> 34:21.329
Check every room on the
east end of the station.

34:21.330 --> 34:23.659
You guys, check ticket
booths on both ends. Go.

34:23.980 --> 34:27.800
Right. Got it.
Castle, what are you thinking?

34:28.190 --> 34:30.018
The only reason to keep him
here is for a quick getaway,

34:30.020 --> 34:31.909
which is helped by the
fact that 680 Canal Street

34:31.909 --> 34:33.210
has its own entrance
to the subway.

34:34.080 --> 34:36.819
If it were me...
I'd keep close enough

34:36.820 --> 34:37.759
to hook up with my partners

34:37.760 --> 34:40.400
but far enough that I
would be out of the way.

34:41.270 --> 34:44.199
Which means he's holding Tyler
on the west end of the tunnel.

34:44.989 --> 34:46.960
West end of the tunnel? This room.

34:47.170 --> 34:49.679
All right. You should
stay back. No chance.

34:54.130 --> 34:55.469
"Go to the 37th floor now."

34:56.239 --> 34:58.240
They said 30 minutes.
It hasn't been 30 minutes yet.

34:58.320 --> 35:00.030
They're changing the timetable
in case you went to the cops.

35:00.320 --> 35:01.270
What's on the 37th floor?

35:02.510 --> 35:04.790
Nothing. It's vacant.
It's not even secure.

35:05.260 --> 35:06.240
Try Beckett.

35:19.470 --> 35:20.370
Nothing.

35:22.150 --> 35:23.260
It's going straight to voice mail.

35:23.620 --> 35:25.250
She must already be in
the subway. I gotta go.

35:25.630 --> 35:28.250
Remember, we can see and hear everything.
Anything goes south,

35:28.330 --> 35:30.050
a hundred cops will be
on you inside a minute.

35:30.140 --> 35:31.750
Not until you find my son.

35:45.990 --> 35:47.539
Just my luck.

35:47.540 --> 35:48.720
Pulled graveyard tonight.

35:53.130 --> 35:54.430
All right. He's in.

35:54.880 --> 35:57.030
Not bad with the guard.
Guy's all right.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.060
Camera and mic are all good.

36:26.300 --> 36:27.220
Whoa.

36:27.360 --> 36:29.969
Take us to the 39th floor.
I want to see Tyler first.

36:29.970 --> 36:32.310
Just follow instructions.
You'll see him soon enough.

36:40.780 --> 36:41.680
What's on the 39th floor?

36:43.600 --> 36:45.480
A financial firm...
Breskin & Wright.

36:46.270 --> 36:47.670
37 was just a staging area.

36:47.940 --> 36:50.379
They let him see their faces.
As soon as they get

36:50.380 --> 36:51.600
what they came for,
they're gonna kill him.

36:51.670 --> 36:52.620
Just like Lightbulb Len.

36:53.280 --> 36:55.270
Beckett's still going to
voice mail. Castle, too.

36:55.490 --> 36:57.550
Sir... what do you want to do?

36:59.400 --> 37:00.750
If we go in before
we find the kid,

37:01.590 --> 37:02.440
we might lose 'em both.

37:10.310 --> 37:11.260
Beckett.

37:35.010 --> 37:36.110
One armed and the kid.

37:36.690 --> 37:38.750
If I go in, he'll kill him
before I get a shot off.

37:39.840 --> 37:40.830
He's holding a flashlight.

37:42.420 --> 37:43.470
If we kill the ambient light,

37:44.280 --> 37:45.360
he'll light up like
a Christmas tree.

37:46.170 --> 37:47.070
We just...

37:50.060 --> 37:50.980
It's like it's meant to be.

37:52.240 --> 37:53.870
Maybe Lenny can prevent
another tragedy.

37:53.880 --> 37:54.780
On my count.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.610
Three, two...

38:01.210 --> 38:02.130
One.

38:11.130 --> 38:12.490
Hit P-1. The subway.

38:15.350 --> 38:17.880
I did what you asked.
Now where's Tyler?

38:18.130 --> 38:19.220
You'll see him in a minute.

38:27.720 --> 38:29.850
Sorry, Dean.
Last stop.

38:31.080 --> 38:31.980
Lobby.

38:33.560 --> 38:34.949
We're supposed to
go to subway level.

38:34.950 --> 38:36.200
Why are we stopping at the lobby?

38:38.670 --> 38:40.140
Don't look at me.
No, look at me.

38:43.500 --> 38:44.870
I suggest you drop your weapons.

38:47.540 --> 38:48.530
Where's Tyler?

39:27.850 --> 39:31.629
The ringleader was Robert Kincaid...
Former bond trader.

39:31.630 --> 39:34.400
He's the one who planned
the entire operation.

39:34.930 --> 39:36.429
The economy might have collapsed,

39:36.430 --> 39:38.340
but he was still
gonna get his payday.

39:38.570 --> 39:39.819
Most of them were
ex wall streeters.

39:39.820 --> 39:41.709
They knew that they needed a
biometric clearance in order

39:41.710 --> 39:43.060
to get on secure floors,

39:43.390 --> 39:45.299
and they knew that Dean
wasn't gonna help them,

39:45.300 --> 39:48.360
so they took Tyler as leverage.
But all they took were files.

39:48.860 --> 39:51.969
Financial files, containing
unpublished earnings reports.

39:51.970 --> 39:54.330
To a savvy investor,
they'd be worth millions.

39:54.750 --> 39:56.669
Would've worked, too,
if Lightbulb Len hadn't have been

39:56.670 --> 39:57.920
taking pictures in the park.

39:58.100 --> 40:00.060
Mm. He helped catch
his own killer.

40:00.360 --> 40:01.880
And foiled a kidnapping.

40:02.790 --> 40:03.776
It's kind of poetic...

40:04.670 --> 40:07.420
In an unspeakably
tragic sort of way.

40:07.950 --> 40:09.350
Mm. The guy you
shot in the subway?

40:09.620 --> 40:11.480
The thug Kincaid hired
to do his dirty work.

40:12.060 --> 40:13.499
He just confessed
to kidnapping Tyler,

40:13.500 --> 40:15.389
murdering Lightbulb Len,
and no surprise,

40:15.390 --> 40:17.280
he ratted out Kincaid
in two seconds flat.

40:17.420 --> 40:19.820
Oh. Speaking of rats...

40:20.380 --> 40:21.790
I-I gotta... I gotta go.

40:31.170 --> 40:32.829
I'm the worst person
in the whole world.

40:32.830 --> 40:34.120
No, you're not.

40:35.870 --> 40:38.699
You're wonderful, and you're
kind, and you're sweet.

40:38.700 --> 40:39.660
I'm a rat killer.

40:39.740 --> 40:42.900
You don't know that.
You may just be a loser.

40:43.880 --> 40:46.770
A-a rat loser.
This did not come out right.

40:48.270 --> 40:49.170
Look...

40:50.980 --> 40:53.320
If he cares, he'll understand.

40:53.780 --> 40:55.430
Yeah, he'll understand, all right.

40:55.850 --> 40:57.229
When he sees me in the halls
at school, he'll think,

40:57.230 --> 40:59.240
there's the awful girl
that lost my best friend.

41:03.320 --> 41:04.260
It's him.

41:08.060 --> 41:10.940
Hi. Hi.
I missed you.

41:11.400 --> 41:12.320
I missed you, too.

41:14.300 --> 41:15.270
W-what's wrong?

41:17.760 --> 41:18.700
It's about Theodore.

41:19.980 --> 41:22.290
When I fed him, he must have
got out of his cage, and...

41:23.550 --> 41:25.790
And he's gone. 
He's gone?

41:26.160 --> 41:27.319
We looked everywhere. I swear.

41:27.320 --> 41:30.670
We've turned this whole place
upside down. How'd he get out?

41:31.980 --> 41:33.539
I must not have
locked the cage right.

41:33.540 --> 41:34.890
Ashley, I'm so sorry.

41:35.920 --> 41:37.060
You have every right to hate me.

41:37.960 --> 41:39.600
Come on, Alexis. I...

41:40.250 --> 41:42.170
I'm... I'm upset,
but I don't hate you.

41:42.970 --> 41:43.870
You don't?

41:44.250 --> 41:45.560
I mean, no, look at this place.

41:47.260 --> 41:48.810
Look at what you did
to try to get him back.

41:50.400 --> 41:51.340
Who else would do that?

41:53.940 --> 41:55.220
You cared about him a lot.

41:56.140 --> 41:57.040
Yeah, but...

41:57.710 --> 41:58.540
I care about you more.
