00:03.880 --> 00:04.881
Hey!

00:04.960 --> 00:06.086
Hey.

00:06.200 --> 00:07.850
- So, Felicity...
- Hi.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.001
- Harry.
- Hello.

00:09.080 --> 00:10.605
- Pavel. And Paul.
- Hi.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.890
Everyone, this is Bill,
your new housemate.

00:14.040 --> 00:16.122
Be nice.

00:17.720 --> 00:18.721
Six bedrooms?

00:18.840 --> 00:21.446
I've got audio equipment,
so some extra space would be good.

00:21.880 --> 00:23.006
I'd quite like underfloor heating.

00:31.680 --> 00:32.680
This is bedroom five.

00:32.759 --> 00:34.364
It hasn't got a door.

00:34.840 --> 00:37.366
Er, bedroom six is just through there.

00:40.440 --> 00:44.490
As you can see, this offers more space.

00:56.760 --> 00:58.046
What do other people do?

00:59.480 --> 01:01.528
- Other people have money.
- Forgive me, but...

01:02.800 --> 01:04.643
Are you looking for somewhere to live?

01:08.240 --> 01:09.571
Oh, wow!

01:10.440 --> 01:12.363
Oh, mate, check the tower!

01:12.440 --> 01:14.886
I'm afraid the tower is unsafe.

01:16.720 --> 01:18.006
Bill, look at it!

01:19.160 --> 01:21.686
Yeah, but why is it so cheap?

01:21.840 --> 01:24.605
This place is great. The rooms are huge!

01:25.200 --> 01:27.646
Can I move in tonight?
My hosts are kicking me out.

01:27.920 --> 01:31.129
Yes. Yes, of course.
So, you'll sign the contract?

01:31.320 --> 01:32.651
- Yes!
- Yea h, of course!

01:35.760 --> 01:36.761
Bill?

02:03.120 --> 02:04.246
Wicked.

03:04.960 --> 03:07.042
What? No, no. No, no. Stop!

03:07.520 --> 03:08.681
Stop!

04:03.640 --> 04:06.325
Three... Two...

04:07.880 --> 04:08.881
One.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.046
That's all you've got?

04:19.440 --> 04:20.885
I thought you'd have loads.

04:20.959 --> 04:22.246
Thanks for helping, yeah?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.490
You should hire this out.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.285
Like a removal service.

04:31.360 --> 04:34.603
Removals? Bill, I'm a Time Lord.

04:35.320 --> 04:37.561
- "Time Lord"? What's that? Your job?
- No, it's my, er...

04:38.800 --> 04:40.245
People. My species.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.211
Doesn't sound like a species.
Sounds posh, like...

04:43.800 --> 04:45.450
"Yes, my lord." Doff my cap.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.449
Oh, well, that's why I gave it up.
Ran away.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.524
Time Lords. That's hilarious.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.491
Do you wear robes and big hats?

04:52.600 --> 04:54.682
No, er, big collars mostly.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.850
- Do you want the postcode?
- Sorry?

04:58.320 --> 04:59.321
To find the house.

05:00.480 --> 05:04.769
Bill, the TARDIS uses multi-dimensional
space-time coordinates.

05:05.440 --> 05:06.487
So you know where it is?

05:07.440 --> 05:09.442
Okay, right, put the postcode in here.

05:12.120 --> 05:15.010
- I saw the bedroom. Do you sleep here?
- If I need to.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.086
- Done?
- Yeah.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.887
"If I need to." What does that mean?

05:19.960 --> 05:22.247
- Sleep's for tortoises.
- Not "Time Lords"?

05:22.400 --> 05:25.370
No. Unless we've regenerated,
or had a big lunch.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.051
Regenerated?

05:28.760 --> 05:31.206
Oh, the questions.
The questions, the questions.

05:31.320 --> 05:33.687
Just remember "Time Lords."
That's enough for now.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.447
- Oh, here we are.
- Ah!

05:44.000 --> 05:46.446
Oh, I'll use the TARDIS.
Take it all to your room.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.807
Firstly, I don't know
which one my room is.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.651
And secondly, that's weird.
And I want to make a good impression.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.286
It's cool. I'lljust get everything
out of the TARDIS and then you can go.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.361
Thanks for the lift, though. Bye.

06:03.600 --> 06:04.761
That's your house?

06:05.240 --> 06:07.083
Sharing, yeah. Six of us. Renting.

06:08.920 --> 06:10.410
I thought you were students.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.284
Yeah. I was like, "What's the catch?"

06:12.400 --> 06:14.801
But actually, it's fine.
Just a bit draughty.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.241
Draughty?

06:29.200 --> 06:30.247
I meant draughty inside.

06:32.080 --> 06:34.560
Interesting. I'll help you in.

06:34.640 --> 06:35.641
No, no. No, it's fine.

06:35.720 --> 06:37.245
You really don't have to. It's like...

06:37.360 --> 06:38.725
- Really not a problem.
- No, wait, honestly.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.325
Um, if you just...

06:41.040 --> 06:43.122
If you can just go
and do history or whatever.

06:45.520 --> 06:48.649
Hey! Where have you been? I thought...
Ah! You're the Doctor?

06:48.720 --> 06:49.960
Yes, hi. Can I get past?

06:50.040 --> 06:51.530
Oh, yeah. He's just helping

06:51.600 --> 06:52.806
- with the move.
- Helping?

06:52.880 --> 06:53.927
- He's just my...
- Friend.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.241
- Granddad.
- Wait, I don't look old enough...

06:56.480 --> 07:00.804
To hold that box for very long.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.770
There. Me.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.128
How exciting is this?

07:06.200 --> 07:07.964
Oh, wow! Doctor! Legend!

07:09.280 --> 07:12.250
- He's my granddad.
- Oh, come on.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.210
Father, at least, please.

07:14.320 --> 07:17.483
All right. Grandfather.

07:18.840 --> 07:20.171
You really can go now, though.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.088
Thanks for the help. job done.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.082
Okay. Bye.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.081
Bye.

07:36.080 --> 07:39.209
He's your granddad? That's awesome.
Mine went greypacking

07:39.280 --> 07:40.930
on the Great Wall of China
with his boyfriend,

07:41.280 --> 07:42.566
but they got arrested
for trying to steal a bit.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.565
- A bit of what?
- Of the wall.

07:45.520 --> 07:46.521
Okay-

07:46.960 --> 07:49.281
- You want a hand?
- Er, yeah.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.881
Thanks.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.484
Keep thinking there's gonna be
one of those bookcases

08:00.560 --> 08:01.800
that you pull special books,

08:02.040 --> 08:03.769
- and it's a secret passage.
- Yeah?

08:04.080 --> 08:06.048
Spooky,

08:11.440 --> 08:12.441
Thanks.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.245
Met Pavel on my first day.

08:18.920 --> 08:21.321
Often does this.
Sits in his room for days.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.004
Says it gets him in the zone.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.851
All these lot are empty.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.446
Yeah, this is nice.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.761
I picked my room
before I'd even seen up here.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.006
Thought you wanted the tower.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.287
Yeah, I wish. Can't find a way in.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.524
There's a freshers' party
in the park tonight.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.961
This lot aren't interested,
but could be fun.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.041
Or not. Er...

08:49.160 --> 08:52.562
But either way, I was saying
we should throw our own party, you know.

08:53.520 --> 08:56.524
Pop up. Freestyle. Boom!

08:57.240 --> 08:59.004
Yeah, sounds good.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.126
- See you later, then.
- Sure.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.807
Here you go, Mum. My own place.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.131
You proud?

09:20.040 --> 09:21.041
Thanks.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.320
Stop it.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.889
There's no living puddles or...

09:45.840 --> 09:47.842
Weird robots, big fish.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.003
It's just a new house.

09:51.440 --> 09:53.283
And people you don't know.

09:54.480 --> 09:55.606
Not scary at all.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.727
I always get nervous
when there's no reception,

10:15.200 --> 10:16.645
like something bad's going to happen.

10:16.720 --> 10:20.167
- We'll have to get a landline.
- Landline? What is this, Scotland?

10:20.480 --> 10:21.925
Actually,

10:22.000 --> 10:24.890
I was unpacking just now
and heard this... Tapping?

10:25.120 --> 10:26.121
Little footsteps?

10:26.200 --> 10:28.089
- Like, in the room above.
- What?

10:28.360 --> 10:29.850
Ooh...

10:30.520 --> 10:32.522
Maybe it's a little doll
who's come to life.

10:32.600 --> 10:35.649
Or maybe a massive, freaky spider.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.929
- Probably just a mouse.
- Yeah, we know. just messing with her.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.525
Mice. If there's mice, I'm leaving.

10:43.480 --> 10:44.527
What's that?

10:45.480 --> 10:47.084
- Pavel?
- Pavel's upstairs.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.761
- Paul, go and have a look.
- Why me?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.047
You're physically the biggest.

10:54.160 --> 10:55.446
And the most expendable.

10:58.840 --> 11:00.410
It's in the kitchen.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.400
It's all right. I'll go.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.601
Maybe it's just the central heating.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.803
- There isn't any.
- I thought...

11:40.880 --> 11:42.211
He'd gone home. Me, too.

11:42.680 --> 11:43.806
Isn't any what?

11:43.920 --> 11:45.206
Central heating.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.402
I've been looking around,
inside and out.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.323
Very interesting. Lots of wood.

11:49.400 --> 11:50.811
Er, why are you still here?

11:52.080 --> 11:53.366
Do you know what that is?

11:53.880 --> 11:56.963
That's an oil-burning heater.
You might need it.

11:57.720 --> 12:01.202
There's no washing machine either.
The hob is from the '30s.

12:01.320 --> 12:02.367
- Thanks so much.
- The power sockets

12:02.440 --> 12:04.329
will not take your devices.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.731
Oh, I thought it was just my room.

12:05.840 --> 12:07.569
No, no, no. They are out of date.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.641
What's that smell?

12:12.920 --> 12:15.890
- Is that Chinese food? I love Chinese.
- Doctor!

12:18.160 --> 12:21.050
There might be a few old things,

12:21.160 --> 12:22.889
but it just needs updating.

12:22.960 --> 12:24.849
It's not like there's some
massive mystery going on.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.646
Did you hear the trees creaking
outside when we arrived?

12:28.400 --> 12:29.561
Yeah, it was the wind.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.240
There wasn't any wind.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.001
You should find another house.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.004
I don't think so.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.606
The rooms are really big.

12:38.680 --> 12:40.569
Exactly, and it's still the best place
for the money.

12:40.880 --> 12:42.769
I'll just call the landlord
and sort it out.

12:42.840 --> 12:44.251
You can't. No reception.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.801
Okay, so I'll go down the hill... Oh.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.006
Aye.

12:51.800 --> 12:52.881
Didn't hear you come in.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.565
For a man such as myself,
discretion is second nature.

12:56.920 --> 12:59.002
So, a gathering. You're all here.

12:59.440 --> 13:00.885
No, except one...

13:01.200 --> 13:04.090
- Pavel's upstairs.
- And one in addition.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.401
He's the Doctor.

13:05.680 --> 13:09.207
- Doctor?
- Oh, he's... He's my grandfather.

13:09.320 --> 13:12.369
- What, assisting with the relocation?
- That's right, yeah.

13:12.440 --> 13:14.249
It's a heart-breaking experience,

13:14.320 --> 13:17.164
to leave one's charge behind
all alone in the big wide world.

13:17.240 --> 13:18.287
Indeed, yes.

13:19.760 --> 13:20.761
You got children?

13:21.080 --> 13:23.003
I... Yes. A daughter.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.521
But I'm most fortunate
she's still under my protection.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.762
So long as that's the case,
I'm most content.

13:28.920 --> 13:32.447
So, now, I was calling to see
if everything's satisfactory.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.530
Actually, there are a few things.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.121
Yes, I see. Go on.

13:36.520 --> 13:37.851
- No central heating.
- Power sockets are wrong.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.286
- And a landline.
- Some new furniture.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.329
- Curtains, carpets.
- Have you got a cat?

13:51.080 --> 13:52.081
A cat?

13:55.160 --> 13:56.321
Er, yeah.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.209
Harry said that he heard
some noise upstairs,

13:58.280 --> 13:59.611
like walking around.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.571
No cats. No pets.

14:04.560 --> 14:07.450
You understand I won't be able
to do any of this tonight,

14:07.560 --> 14:09.528
but as soon as possible, yes.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.045
Knock on wood, do what I can.

14:12.120 --> 14:14.805
That's another thing.
The house is really creaky.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.684
Everything you touch, it's like...

14:16.760 --> 14:18.330
It's unavoidable, my dear.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.687
- How do you get into the tower?
- You don't.

14:22.960 --> 14:26.806
The tower is specifically excluded
from the terms of our agreement.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.282
Oh, right. Well, thank you.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.206
No tower. Got it.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.486
Right.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.566
- Oh, er, are you staying here tonight?
- Yeah.

14:40.760 --> 14:41.761
Er, no, he's not.

14:41.880 --> 14:43.769
- Well, I'm not sure.
- There's no reason to.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.446
- I probably will.
- There isn't a bed, so...

14:47.400 --> 14:48.561
All right.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.609
Sorry, excuse me. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.491
Who, um... Who's the prime minister?

14:57.400 --> 14:58.811
I beg your pardon?

14:59.120 --> 15:01.248
- Margaret Thatcher, Harriet Jones?
- Oh, come on.

15:01.360 --> 15:02.361
Wilson? Eden?

15:03.800 --> 15:06.804
I think it's better to leave your
granddaughter here with her friends.

15:06.880 --> 15:10.646
They seem respectable.
And I'll keep an eye, of course.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.964
I'll attend to your requirements
in the morning.

15:19.040 --> 15:21.042
In the meantime, sleep well.

15:30.320 --> 15:34.006
I take it back. You're fine. He's weird.

15:34.080 --> 15:36.082
Ah, the washing machine.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.850
That's weird.

15:47.920 --> 15:49.206
He's not there.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.810
That's it. That's the noise I heard.

15:55.520 --> 15:56.646
Fascinating.

16:06.080 --> 16:08.526
It's just pipes. I'm going to bed.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.085
Yeah, I might go up as well.

16:10.160 --> 16:11.924
Me, too. Locking my door though.

16:12.240 --> 16:13.526
Er, Grandfather?

16:15.880 --> 16:18.167
Hello? Yeah.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.408
- Perhaps you'd leave now?
- No, I'm fine.

16:20.560 --> 16:23.769
Well, at least, erm, go and sleep.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.604
Outside, in the car.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.842
- Are you two tired?
- Well, I...

16:27.920 --> 16:29.365
Good. No, I'm gonna hang about
with Simon.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.010
- Harry. Felicity.
- Florence.

16:31.360 --> 16:33.522
- Yeah, why?
- Well, we're gonna chill. Yeah?

16:33.600 --> 16:34.886
Yeah. Okay, yes!

16:34.960 --> 16:36.962
- Put some tunes on, yes?
- Yes!

16:37.040 --> 16:38.565
- All right.
- I'm good at making friends.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.404
- Give me your phone.
- But why? There's no reception.

16:40.560 --> 16:41.607
Phone.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.841
- I love this.
- Do you know who this is?

16:49.920 --> 16:53.129
Do I know who this is?
Yes, I know who this is.

16:53.200 --> 16:56.010
Yeah, it's Spotify,
so it's probably random.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.650
- Mix...
- You like Little Mix?

16:58.760 --> 17:01.604
Oh, clearly she does.
Look, there's a whole playlist here.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.489
- What else have you got on this?
- Can I have a word, please?

17:08.240 --> 17:10.641
Honestly, Doctor,
there's nothing going on.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.760
Nothing weird, nothing alien.

17:13.839 --> 17:18.323
Just an old house and a dodgy landlord,
which is pretty standard for students.

17:19.680 --> 17:22.569
I'll see you later
for more exciting TARDIS action,

17:22.640 --> 17:25.689
but basically, this is the bit
of my life that you're not in.

17:27.359 --> 17:28.361
Do you know what I mean?

17:29.200 --> 17:30.964
- I know what you mean.
- Thanks.

17:32.280 --> 17:34.851
So, up the wooden hill you go.

17:35.760 --> 17:37.125
- Sleep well.
- Okay.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.964
Maybe, before you do,
you should check on your friend

17:39.040 --> 17:40.565
who hasn't been seen for a day

17:40.640 --> 17:42.722
and who has strange music
coming out of his room.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.531
- They say he just does that.
- Nobody just does anything.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.361
- You're not leaving, are you?
- No.

17:50.760 --> 17:52.046
Your friend will probably be fine.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.243
Knock on wood.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.761
We need to have a talk
about your taste in music.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.285
You comin' up?

17:59.360 --> 18:00.521
Yeah.

18:10.160 --> 18:13.448
Oh, this freaky Scooby Doo house!

18:13.520 --> 18:17.525
- Er, well...
- Ooh...

18:17.600 --> 18:20.001
If you get scared in the night,
you know where I am. Yeah?

18:20.080 --> 18:23.607
- What?
- Just if you need any of my help,

18:23.680 --> 18:25.887
- or whatever, you know?
- Yeah, erm...

18:27.280 --> 18:30.011
I get that you're into me, but, erm...

18:30.960 --> 18:32.849
Sorry, you're not my type.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.921
Just, erm, I tend to go for girls,
usually, so...

18:36.240 --> 18:38.163
Oh... Oh, right!

18:38.280 --> 18:40.282
I was never in with a chance. Awesome.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.041
Jeez, stop!

18:43.120 --> 18:45.964
This is what I'm talking about.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.326
This stuff really freaks you out,
doesn't it?

18:47.400 --> 18:49.687
No! It's just annoying.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.046
- Oh.
- Go to bed!

18:51.120 --> 18:52.167
Sure.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.921
See you in the morning.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.001
Night, then.

19:03.720 --> 19:05.848
Why didn't you get a room next to me,
like we said?

19:05.920 --> 19:07.763
What? I dunno.

19:08.320 --> 19:11.244
- Doesn't mean anything.
- I'm not cool enough, is that it?

19:11.560 --> 19:13.927
No! Shut up! These are my mates, too.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.241
Paul, not funny.

19:17.480 --> 19:18.811
Do you fancy him?

19:18.920 --> 19:20.331
No, who? Paul? Why? No.

19:20.400 --> 19:23.609
Hey, it's not funny!

19:29.480 --> 19:30.641
Paul?

19:33.680 --> 19:34.966
Are you okay?

19:35.080 --> 19:36.081
Mate?

19:36.560 --> 19:38.289
Come on, we got the joke.

19:42.760 --> 19:45.604
- All rig ht.
- See?

19:45.680 --> 19:49.162
He's fine. Okay. See you in the morning.

19:51.280 --> 19:52.964
What?

19:53.200 --> 19:54.486
Er, what's going on?

19:57.680 --> 19:58.727
Paul?

20:01.360 --> 20:02.486
Ah, we should get the Doctor.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.648
Why? What's he gonna do? Lecture?

20:06.920 --> 20:10.242
Just a normal day. just a normal day...

20:11.120 --> 20:12.121
Up.

20:18.560 --> 20:19.846
Do you like this music, Doctor?

20:19.920 --> 20:22.127
Reminds me of Quincy Jones.

20:23.200 --> 20:24.884
I stepped in for him once.

20:25.680 --> 20:28.968
The bassist he'd hired turned out to be
a Klarj neon death voc bot.

20:29.040 --> 20:31.281
What was worse, he couldn't play.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.285
This is very interesting.

20:34.120 --> 20:35.770
- The door?
- Because it isn't.

20:35.840 --> 20:38.411
- Isn't...
- A door. Any more.

20:38.480 --> 20:39.686
Try to open it.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.763
Come on.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.604
Shireen did it a minute ago.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.723
- So, it's locked?
- No. Look.

20:49.960 --> 20:51.291
It's completely sealed.

20:52.160 --> 20:53.366
I don't understand.

21:03.240 --> 21:05.527
- The shutters!
- What about them?

21:05.600 --> 21:06.806
Closed by themselves.

21:13.520 --> 21:14.885
Sealed.

21:14.960 --> 21:16.564
So, we're trapped.

21:16.640 --> 21:18.165
Maybe that's the idea.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.482
What do you mean?

21:20.560 --> 21:21.925
What's that?

21:22.760 --> 21:24.888
No, no, no. There's something in here.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.728
- I can't be trapped! I can't!
- Wait!

21:37.360 --> 21:39.249
- Don't go out there!
- I can't be trapped!

21:43.240 --> 21:46.289
Great. Now we're stuck here.

21:46.760 --> 21:48.171
Why did you try and stop her?

21:48.240 --> 21:50.402
Listen!

21:57.680 --> 22:00.251
Police. Call the police. Call...

22:14.320 --> 22:15.446
What's happened to her?

22:16.360 --> 22:17.361
What's going on?

22:18.960 --> 22:20.962
Do you think it's like she said?
A thing?

22:21.440 --> 22:22.885
Maybe.

22:23.680 --> 22:26.001
And so, is it out there now, or in here?

22:26.120 --> 22:28.088
- Or both.
- I'm scared.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.531
- Don't be.
- Why not?

22:29.640 --> 22:30.641
It doesn't help.

22:36.520 --> 22:37.965
Who's there?

22:53.280 --> 22:54.805
- God.
- Pavel!

23:03.920 --> 23:05.922
Pavel...

23:06.000 --> 23:07.729
Do you think he can hear us?

23:10.440 --> 23:11.930
It'll be okay.

23:12.240 --> 23:13.810
Is this what happened to Paul?

23:14.320 --> 23:16.322
- Do we call an ambulance?
- There's no reception.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.323
Shireen, sort the record out.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.881
Oh, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

23:23.680 --> 23:25.205
Is it something to do with the music?

23:30.000 --> 23:31.684
Did someone do this to you?

23:34.120 --> 23:36.248
I have no desire to intrude...

23:36.320 --> 23:37.685
But I felt there was a problem.

23:37.840 --> 23:40.161
How did you get up here?
It's sealed shut.

23:40.240 --> 23:43.449
Music can be pleasant,
but a simple repetition like that,

23:43.520 --> 23:46.410
it's merely a distraction
from the inevitable.

23:46.480 --> 23:48.403
Hope is its own form of cruelty.

23:48.800 --> 23:50.450
Pavel! No, wait, put it back!

23:55.600 --> 23:56.647
Oh, look.

23:58.400 --> 23:59.925
He's released.

24:01.600 --> 24:02.965
Mercy at last.

24:03.720 --> 24:05.370
Beautiful, isn't it?

24:06.320 --> 24:07.845
Nature contained.

24:08.840 --> 24:10.888
He's preserved in the walls,

24:10.960 --> 24:14.169
in the very fabric
of the building, forever.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.408
So, the house is eating people?

24:16.520 --> 24:19.091
We must all pay our dues.

24:19.440 --> 24:21.204
- But not you?
- Correct!

24:22.000 --> 24:23.445
I am the exception.

24:26.880 --> 24:28.848
For I am your landlord.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.161
You came here, you signed the contract.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.085
And now...

24:37.680 --> 24:41.002
It's time to pay.

24:43.840 --> 24:45.524
Go.

24:50.760 --> 24:52.524
What's that noise?

24:52.640 --> 24:55.120
That tower,
it was at the back of the building.

24:55.520 --> 24:58.126
Logically, the door should be
at the end of this corridor.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.321
Look for a way in.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.208
Indiana Jones, come on.

25:09.680 --> 25:11.125
Yes, the tower.

25:14.960 --> 25:18.009
What if something has got into the wood?

25:18.480 --> 25:20.244
Into the laths, behind the plaster,

25:20.360 --> 25:23.603
into the very fabric of the house.

25:26.800 --> 25:27.926
Wood nymphs.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.321
Tree spirits.

25:31.560 --> 25:32.561
Dryads.

25:34.080 --> 25:35.081
Anything's possible.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.769
Doctor, what are you doing?

25:41.960 --> 25:44.247
We need to get out, call the police.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.964
Who's there?

25:47.080 --> 25:48.969
Doctor, you're provoking it.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.166
It's getting louder.

25:50.320 --> 25:52.004
Wake up! Wake up! Out you come!

25:56.880 --> 25:58.644
Oh!

25:58.720 --> 26:00.324
I was expecting something
quite different.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.482
You know, like a gaseous creature
or microscopic...

26:02.600 --> 26:03.840
Did you see it move through the wood?

26:04.080 --> 26:07.129
Interacting at a cellular level.
This must be alien.

26:07.240 --> 26:09.368
Got to be alien.
What are you doing here?

26:09.480 --> 26:10.561
On your holidays?

26:10.640 --> 26:12.210
- Harry, get a matchbox.
- A matchbox?

26:12.280 --> 26:13.964
All right, a shoe box...
Don't let it get away!

26:14.400 --> 26:15.845
What do you mean "alien"?

26:15.920 --> 26:19.367
- Oh, little one!
- Doctor...

26:19.440 --> 26:21.681
Oh, it can move fast.
Come on, where's that box?

26:21.800 --> 26:23.370
- Doctor!
- What?

26:26.000 --> 26:27.286
Ah!

26:28.240 --> 26:32.404
Now, this starts to make sense.
Yes, dryads, indeed.

26:32.720 --> 26:33.767
We need to get out.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.047
We can't.

26:39.280 --> 26:40.645
Hey, in here!

26:43.440 --> 26:45.283
What's the point
of hiding in a cupboard?

26:46.000 --> 26:47.411
It's not a cupboard.

26:56.560 --> 26:57.925
What are they?

26:58.000 --> 26:59.047
Look like insects,

26:59.120 --> 27:01.521
but you're saying
they can shut doors, trap us.

27:02.920 --> 27:06.811
They're not just in the wood.
They're becoming the wood itself.

27:06.880 --> 27:08.564
Total infestation.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.165
Infestation of the dryads.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.647
You're talking like
you've seen things like this before.

27:12.720 --> 27:15.929
- No, actually.
- You said they were alien.

27:16.040 --> 27:18.884
Well, they could be
native to this planet,

27:18.960 --> 27:20.405
but I've never seen them before.
Have you?

27:20.480 --> 27:22.642
And that's what they're called?
"Dryads"?

27:22.720 --> 27:24.848
Well, that's what I'm calling them, yes.

27:24.920 --> 27:25.921
You've gone crazy.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.128
Well, I can't just call them
lice, can I?

28:01.520 --> 28:03.249
There's something behind there.

28:03.880 --> 28:05.325
Father?

28:05.840 --> 28:07.251
Is that you?

28:21.200 --> 28:23.248
Maybe it belonged to a family
that used to live here?

28:25.360 --> 28:27.601
Harry, there's six boxes.

28:30.480 --> 28:33.051
Tenancy agreement. Same as ours.

28:35.040 --> 28:36.246
Six signatures.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.930
Jake Christie, Annie Wren,
Jonathan Frost.

28:40.480 --> 28:43.927
- What's the date?
- Er, 1997.

28:44.680 --> 28:47.126
Sarah Tiller, Mark Hopethorne,
Carl Richards.

28:47.760 --> 28:51.048
They move in, relax...

28:52.680 --> 28:54.250
Go to their rooms.

28:56.080 --> 28:57.366
Then panic.

28:59.920 --> 29:00.967
Infestation.

29:05.440 --> 29:06.441
Doctor.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.440
1977.

29:19.760 --> 29:22.161
1957. Every 20 years.

29:24.400 --> 29:25.447
There's something coming.

29:26.320 --> 29:27.446
Good.

29:34.280 --> 29:35.281
Christie.

29:35.600 --> 29:40.083
Wren, Frost, Tiller,
Hopethorne, Richards...

29:40.520 --> 29:43.205
Fine young men and women.

29:43.280 --> 29:44.884
As were all the others.

29:47.840 --> 29:50.446
- Where are they?
- In the house.

29:50.640 --> 29:53.291
What? Where? We haven't seen 'em.

29:53.360 --> 29:55.681
He means, they're in the house.

29:57.600 --> 29:58.601
The wood, Harry.

29:59.920 --> 30:02.321
Don't think I haven't considered
the consequences, Doctor.

30:02.440 --> 30:03.521
So, why do it?

30:07.760 --> 30:09.330
My daughter was dying.

30:09.640 --> 30:11.085
What are you talking about?

30:11.280 --> 30:12.725
Nothing could be done.

30:15.120 --> 30:17.851
Until these creatures saved her.

30:20.520 --> 30:22.443
We'd do anything to protect them.

30:22.960 --> 30:24.610
Your daughter, she's here.
She's in the house, isn't she?

30:25.520 --> 30:26.965
Indeed.

30:27.840 --> 30:29.524
And she must survive.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.286
Well, we have to get out!

30:32.200 --> 30:33.690
Harry, stay with me!

30:33.800 --> 30:34.801
Come back, Harry!

30:35.120 --> 30:36.167
Come back!

30:39.680 --> 30:40.841
Ah! Doctor!

30:41.680 --> 30:42.681
Get him out!

30:52.720 --> 30:54.165
God rest his soul.

30:54.600 --> 30:55.931
Bill! Is Bill all right?

30:57.640 --> 30:59.369
I'd be more concerned
for yourself, Doctor.

30:59.560 --> 31:02.325
Your advanced age
means you have less energy,

31:02.440 --> 31:04.169
less matter.

31:04.240 --> 31:06.242
But they will take what they can get.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.202
The insects
are keeping your daughter alive.

31:09.680 --> 31:10.727
How does that work?

31:11.680 --> 31:14.650
Come on, call these off.
Maybe I could help.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.485
I'm a doctor.

31:18.320 --> 31:19.606
Er, are you okay?

31:23.520 --> 31:26.967
I haven't had visitors
in such a long time.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.288
My name is Eliza.

31:32.520 --> 31:36.002
- I'm Bill. This is Shireen.
- Hey.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.009
I'm pleased to meet you.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.281
Bill...

31:52.200 --> 31:53.486
What?

31:53.840 --> 31:58.004
You've got something just... just there.

32:00.360 --> 32:02.249
I'm a celebrity,
get me out of here, yeah?

32:02.480 --> 32:04.403
Bill...

32:08.840 --> 32:10.001
Cockroaches.

32:10.080 --> 32:12.845
Had 'em on my gap year in Morocco.
No problem. Let's go.

32:13.120 --> 32:14.167
Shireen...

32:15.280 --> 32:18.602
Oh, no... Oh, no!

32:18.960 --> 32:20.530
It's in my foot!

32:22.600 --> 32:24.011
Shireen!

32:29.040 --> 32:31.088
I don't understand. She's...

32:31.400 --> 32:34.324
It's upsetting you. I understand.

32:34.400 --> 32:37.131
But Father says we have to survive.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.362
Eliza, do not fear this man.

32:46.440 --> 32:48.886
He says he might be able
to make you well.

32:51.120 --> 32:52.326
Bill, how are you?

32:53.760 --> 32:57.321
Yeah... Yeah, I'm okay. Er, Shireen...

32:57.520 --> 32:59.090
- The lice.
- Yeah.

32:59.240 --> 33:00.241
Harry, too.

33:00.360 --> 33:01.600
Um, in brief, he's her dad.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.523
He's been keeping her alive with
the bugs for about 70 years.

33:03.600 --> 33:06.809
Your friends are the food.
I said that I could help.

33:10.560 --> 33:13.769
Now, you must be Eliza.
How are you feeling? Rotten?

33:14.280 --> 33:15.770
I am quite well.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.684
Administer your treatment, Doctor.

33:18.080 --> 33:19.605
Well, what's the medical history here?
What happened?

33:19.680 --> 33:23.127
- Eliza, you were very ill. Yes?
- Yes.

33:24.800 --> 33:28.850
The doctors had, um, given up on you.

33:30.120 --> 33:32.327
But then, one day,
your father brings you a present.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.323
Where did you find them?
What, on the roof? In the garden?

33:36.720 --> 33:39.883
You find the insects,
you bring them into the house,

33:40.000 --> 33:41.889
er, because you want
to show them to her.

33:41.960 --> 33:43.769
Presumably, just to...

33:43.880 --> 33:45.041
just to amuse her.

33:47.400 --> 33:48.731
I mean,
you couldn't have known what they were.

33:48.840 --> 33:50.171
Can you help her or not?

33:50.320 --> 33:52.322
I am helping. This is me helping.

33:52.400 --> 33:55.882
How did you find out
their unique abilities?

33:56.080 --> 33:58.162
Did you bring them in here?
You brought them in here, right,

33:58.280 --> 33:59.770
but what activated them?

34:00.000 --> 34:01.684
You use a tuning fork now, but...

34:01.800 --> 34:04.246
Pavel had that record on of a violin...

34:04.320 --> 34:05.651
High-pitched sounds, yes.

34:14.639 --> 34:16.051
Soothes her to sleep.

34:17.679 --> 34:18.966
High-pitched sound.

34:20.080 --> 34:22.731
You leave your daughter
alone for the night,

34:22.800 --> 34:24.165
or so you believe.

34:24.960 --> 34:27.440
The music wakes them. They set to work.

34:28.840 --> 34:31.922
And in the morning,
you find her revitalised.

34:32.159 --> 34:33.924
Just... Slightly wooden.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.889
You realise there's a way
she can survive.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.085
Enough!

34:40.199 --> 34:42.168
Wait, Doctor, that doesn't make sense.

34:45.199 --> 34:47.282
Can you not interrupt?
I'm doing my thing here.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.641
Why would he pick up insects
in the garden

34:49.719 --> 34:50.801
and bring them in
to see his ill daughter?

34:51.199 --> 34:53.043
- Everyone loves insects.
- I don't.

34:53.199 --> 34:54.610
They're fascinating.

34:54.800 --> 34:58.282
Okay... Secondly, he's not wood.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.807
- He's just like us.
- He's...

35:02.800 --> 35:04.564
- Yes.
- So, if he's her father,

35:05.600 --> 35:08.331
and she was preserved 70 years ago...

35:10.600 --> 35:11.761
You...

35:12.680 --> 35:14.091
No flies on you, Bill.

35:15.440 --> 35:16.601
And no bugs in you.

35:17.760 --> 35:19.444
I do not understand.

35:19.520 --> 35:20.760
I forget, you see.

35:20.840 --> 35:23.764
Your human lifespan, it's...
It's not long, is it?

35:23.880 --> 35:25.848
Do not let them trouble you.

35:26.320 --> 35:28.209
What do you remember of the past, Eliza?

35:28.320 --> 35:31.369
My father...

35:32.680 --> 35:34.648
He knows what's best.

35:34.880 --> 35:36.609
Yes. The lice preserve the appearance

35:36.680 --> 35:38.250
and the voice,
but not so much the memories.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.882
- He's not your father, am I right?
- No!

35:41.840 --> 35:42.841
Stop talking!

35:43.240 --> 35:46.084
Father? What's the matter?

35:46.160 --> 35:47.685
I don't understand.

35:47.760 --> 35:50.331
Your father would have
had better things to do

35:50.720 --> 35:53.769
than playing with insects in the garden.

35:54.640 --> 35:56.642
But he isn't your father.

35:56.720 --> 35:59.200
When you were ill,
he was sent out of the house

35:59.280 --> 36:00.486
by the doctors

36:00.640 --> 36:02.608
who were failing to save his mother.

36:02.720 --> 36:03.846
His...

36:05.040 --> 36:06.246
Mother?

36:09.600 --> 36:11.602
Eliza, he's your son.

36:14.960 --> 36:16.849
Your loving son.

36:27.600 --> 36:28.681
My son?

36:33.160 --> 36:34.321
Forgive me.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.286
Forgive me.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.681
When you saw
what the creatures had done,

36:49.760 --> 36:51.524
you understood, didn't you?

36:52.640 --> 36:54.290
The lice could keep your mother alive,

36:55.280 --> 36:59.842
if you protected them,
tamed them, fed them.

37:01.200 --> 37:03.601
If you could save the one
who brought you into this world,

37:03.680 --> 37:04.841
wouldn't you?

37:09.160 --> 37:11.128
Your silence is a confirmation.

37:13.920 --> 37:18.005
I did what you told me
because I thought you knew best.

37:19.600 --> 37:22.171
But I... I am your mother.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.483
And you...

37:27.400 --> 37:30.006
All these children you've taken...

37:30.640 --> 37:34.804
You told me it was necessary,
that we had no choice.

37:34.880 --> 37:38.089
That's right, it was.
It meant we could stay together.

37:38.160 --> 37:40.686
Don't you understand? We were happy.

37:41.680 --> 37:44.570
I kept our lives a secret,

37:44.880 --> 37:48.202
and a secret we must remain.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.367
You have brought her
nothing but misery.

37:55.560 --> 37:56.971
And confusion!

37:58.000 --> 38:00.685
You will be taken. Like the others!

38:07.120 --> 38:09.691
Okay... Now's the time for the plan.

38:09.840 --> 38:12.241
That was it, no plan.
Info dump then busk.

38:12.520 --> 38:13.521
Well, start busking.

38:13.680 --> 38:16.490
Eliza, people have died
and will continue to die

38:16.560 --> 38:18.483
unless you stop all this right now.

38:18.560 --> 38:19.925
How can I stop it?

38:20.040 --> 38:22.930
You're the parent. You're in charge!

38:31.720 --> 38:32.846
That's it.

38:36.040 --> 38:38.566
Do what I say! I control you!

38:40.240 --> 38:41.366
No.

38:42.800 --> 38:43.847
It's me.

38:45.600 --> 38:46.931
I control them.

38:48.080 --> 38:49.969
Eliza, finish them now.

38:50.440 --> 38:51.726
Take them or you'll die!

38:52.080 --> 38:53.525
They'll destroy you!

38:53.960 --> 38:56.566
What's the point of surviving
if you never see anyone,

38:56.640 --> 38:58.563
if you hide yourself
away from the world?

38:59.120 --> 39:00.645
When did you last open the shutters?

39:12.680 --> 39:14.887
It's the freshers' party in the park.

39:14.960 --> 39:16.166
Exactly.

39:16.240 --> 39:19.130
New friends, fireworks.
That's what life should be.

39:21.160 --> 39:22.446
I remember.

39:24.720 --> 39:26.006
My son.

39:27.760 --> 39:30.081
Leave my side at last.

39:31.840 --> 39:33.604
Go and see the world.

39:33.680 --> 39:36.081
No. I don't want to.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.802
If you won't finish them,

39:41.280 --> 39:42.486
I will!

39:47.440 --> 39:48.885
My little boy.

39:49.200 --> 39:50.645
This has to end.

39:51.120 --> 39:55.125
No, we mustn't end.
We have to destroy them.

39:55.280 --> 39:56.884
It's our time.

40:00.520 --> 40:02.648
No, I... I don't want to.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.768
No. No.

40:10.160 --> 40:11.207
Thank you.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.682
We've got to get out of here.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.001
Is that...

40:24.080 --> 40:26.321
Yes, your friend.
She's restoring them.

40:32.400 --> 40:35.529
- I thought you were gone.
- Are you okay?

40:35.600 --> 40:37.204
Me? Yeah, I'm fine.

40:38.560 --> 40:40.085
- What about the others?
- Come on!

40:47.760 --> 40:49.285
We need to get out! Now!

40:56.880 --> 40:58.644
Wrong way! Wrong way! Wrong way!

41:04.520 --> 41:06.329
Down goes the deposit.

41:06.400 --> 41:08.243
Oh, man, that's our house.

41:09.360 --> 41:10.486
Gone.

41:13.360 --> 41:15.840
Right, you lot.
Back to the estate agent's.

41:18.760 --> 41:20.171
Better luck next time.

41:27.200 --> 41:29.123
Well, here he comes.

41:29.200 --> 41:31.123
Are you being cheerful?
I'm against cheerful.

41:31.280 --> 41:33.521
Bill told me you went on
a little adventure.

41:34.240 --> 41:36.163
- You see?
- I see what?

41:36.240 --> 41:40.370
Well, you don't have to go
to outer space to find monsters.

41:40.680 --> 41:43.365
There's plenty of things want
to kill you right here on Earth.

41:43.440 --> 41:44.646
Result.

41:45.520 --> 41:48.569
Hmm. Actually, I'm not that hungry.

41:48.720 --> 41:51.041
- Well, I am.
- Obviously.

41:52.800 --> 41:54.643
Okay, you can take
the rest of the night off.

41:54.800 --> 41:56.404
Go on, go and do whatever it is you do.

41:56.640 --> 41:59.120
Actually, what do you do?
No. Never tell me that.

41:59.400 --> 42:01.368
Yeah, I just want
to have a look at this.

42:01.480 --> 42:04.404
Our friend inside's
been a little restive lately.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.084
Erm, I can sort that out.

42:06.160 --> 42:09.004
- No, it's all right. I don't mind.
- Good night, Nardole.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.721
Right. Good night, sir.

42:15.760 --> 42:17.364
See you in the morning.

42:24.560 --> 42:25.561
A piano?

42:26.400 --> 42:28.209
You've put a piano in there. Why?

42:29.200 --> 42:30.281
Good night.

42:31.520 --> 42:34.330
You don't learn, do you, sir?

42:45.600 --> 42:49.047
Hey! Do you want dinner?
I've got Mexican.

42:51.720 --> 42:52.960
Look...

42:53.520 --> 42:56.808
I know you miss it all,
but I'm stuck here, too, you know.

42:56.880 --> 42:58.484
We're both prisoners.

42:59.080 --> 43:00.491
So, what do you say? Dinner?

43:03.280 --> 43:05.169
And I've got a new story for you, too.

43:05.960 --> 43:08.725
There's a haunted house
and woodlice from space.

43:11.720 --> 43:13.688
And lots of young people get eaten.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.126
I'm coming in.

43:30.000 --> 43:31.081
Mining station. Chasm.

43:31.600 --> 43:33.045
A forge. Crew of 40.

43:33.520 --> 43:34.646
Hello?

43:34.880 --> 43:36.041
Four survivors.

43:37.600 --> 43:38.965
One distress call.

43:39.440 --> 43:40.726
They were killed by their own suits.

43:41.640 --> 43:44.723
That means there's 36 corpses
walking about this station.

43:45.120 --> 43:46.246
If we want to keep breathing,

43:46.320 --> 43:48.641
we have exactly one option.

43:48.800 --> 43:50.802
None of us
have more than 3,000 breaths left.

43:50.880 --> 43:51.927
Then stop wasting them.
