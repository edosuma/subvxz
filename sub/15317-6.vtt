WEBVTT

00:01.341 --> 00:02.940
Previously on Sanctuary...

00:02.941 --> 00:04.710
This isn't a disease, Henry.

00:04.711 --> 00:07.011
I have spent my adult life

00:07.012 --> 00:08.247
working with abnormals,

00:08.248 --> 00:09.648
but now I am one.

00:09.649 --> 00:12.651
Look, I can't account for
myself when I'm that thing,

00:12.652 --> 00:13.985
and what if I hurt one of you?

00:13.986 --> 00:15.621
The difference between you and me

00:15.622 --> 00:16.755
is you can control your power.

00:16.756 --> 00:18.790
And in time, so will you.

00:22.895 --> 00:24.463
Awesome.

00:26.299 --> 00:27.932
You are such a dork.

00:27.933 --> 00:29.568
You said, "no problem.

00:29.569 --> 00:30.969
I'll take over the
feedings while you're gone,"

00:30.970 --> 00:32.337
and then you crap out on me

00:32.338 --> 00:33.705
before I even leave.

00:33.706 --> 00:35.006
I know, but, hey, secure networks tank,

00:35.007 --> 00:36.642
I'm the go-to guy.
What am I going to do?

00:36.643 --> 00:38.810
Yeah, last time I ask you for a favor.

00:38.811 --> 00:39.844
Okay, look, I can still swing by there

00:39.845 --> 00:40.945
after I'm done.

00:40.946 --> 00:42.481
It'll be, like, 30,  minutes, tops.

00:42.482 --> 00:43.948
Oh,  minutes Henry Foss time?

00:43.949 --> 00:45.751
Jack will die of hunger by then.

00:45.752 --> 00:46.818
Come on,

00:46.819 --> 00:48.287
you know he's our baby.

00:48.288 --> 00:49.788
Oh... Oh, that is cold.

00:49.789 --> 00:51.757
I'm just saying.

00:51.758 --> 00:53.057
Go catch your flight, all right?

00:53.058 --> 00:55.560
Don't want to miss
your romantic getaway.

00:55.561 --> 00:56.828
Oh, Henry...

00:56.829 --> 00:59.431
If you can call a
biochemistry conference

00:59.432 --> 01:01.333
in beautiful downtown
Blackpool romantic.

01:01.334 --> 01:03.602
Yeah, well, you got to admit,
at least he's making an effort.

01:04.937 --> 01:07.306
All right, you're right, my bad.

01:07.307 --> 01:10.041
Besides, I'm already at the lab.

01:10.042 --> 01:11.876
Okay, you know what?

01:11.877 --> 01:14.379
Just go, have a good time,
and don't worry about Jack.

01:14.380 --> 01:15.647
I'll make sure he's...

01:15.648 --> 01:17.048
Oh, my God, Jack?

01:17.049 --> 01:18.049
No.

01:18.050 --> 01:19.083
Rachel, what's going on?

01:19.084 --> 01:20.084
Wait, Jack, stay there.

01:20.085 --> 01:21.753
Rachel!

01:21.754 --> 01:22.921
It's okay, I can help
you. I can help you..

01:22.922 --> 01:23.955
Damnit.

01:23.956 --> 01:25.256
Rachel?

01:26.392 --> 01:27.392
Rachel?

01:27.393 --> 01:28.660
Henry... help me.

01:28.661 --> 01:31.062
Rachel, what's going on?

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:03.220 --> 02:04.454
Rachel!

02:04.455 --> 02:06.289
Oh, God...

02:06.290 --> 02:08.324
Henry!

02:08.324 --> 02:09.559
It's on the run!

02:09.560 --> 02:11.227
Load tranqs!

02:11.228 --> 02:12.495
Oh, my God...

02:12.496 --> 02:13.296
You go after Jack. I got her.

02:13.297 --> 02:14.263
Yeah?

02:14.264 --> 02:15.431
Yeah.

02:15.432 --> 02:17.567
All right, here.

02:17.568 --> 02:20.203
Come on.

02:20.204 --> 02:22.105
Just hang on.

02:23.307 --> 02:24.307
Oh, thank God.

02:24.308 --> 02:25.675
Rachel?

02:25.676 --> 02:26.943
Rachel...

02:28.045 --> 02:29.045
It's okay.

02:29.046 --> 02:30.013
- Henry...
- It's okay.

02:30.014 --> 02:31.147
The blood!

02:31.148 --> 02:32.281
The blood...

02:36.420 --> 02:37.721
No, no, no, hang on.

02:37.722 --> 02:39.089
Stay with me.

02:39.090 --> 02:40.690
Stay with me!

02:40.691 --> 02:41.691
Henry?

02:41.692 --> 02:42.692
Hey, doc?

02:42.693 --> 02:43.727
Calm down.

02:43.728 --> 02:44.393
It's Rachel.

02:44.394 --> 02:45.629
Is she...

02:45.630 --> 02:47.363
She's alive, but she's unconscious,

02:47.364 --> 02:49.032
And she's been cut.

02:49.033 --> 02:50.299
Are you gloved up?

02:50.300 --> 02:51.400
Yeah.

02:51.401 --> 02:52.969
Where's the big guy?

02:52.970 --> 02:53.970
He's on his way

02:53.971 --> 02:55.038
with a haz-mat transport.

02:55.039 --> 02:56.072
I'll prep the O.R.

02:57.074 --> 02:58.407
Do you think she's infected?

02:58.408 --> 02:59.943
I won't know

02:59.944 --> 03:01.978
until I get her into surgery, Henry,

03:01.979 --> 03:03.446
but if the creature did lay spores...

03:03.447 --> 03:04.514
Yeah, I know, doc.

03:04.515 --> 03:07.751
She's dead.

03:07.752 --> 03:12.022
I'm two blocks out,
widening my perimeter.

03:12.023 --> 03:12.555
Kate?

03:12.556 --> 03:14.490
Kate?

03:14.491 --> 03:16.092
Kate, talk to me.

03:16.093 --> 03:17.360
I saw something

03:17.361 --> 03:20.396
heading down behind the hill warehouse.

03:20.397 --> 03:21.497
How's her pulse?

03:21.498 --> 03:23.299
It's rapid, but it's kind of weak.

03:23.300 --> 03:24.768
Do you think you could pack her wounds?

03:24.769 --> 03:26.169
Yeah, sure.

03:26.170 --> 03:27.570
What do I do?

03:27.571 --> 03:28.738
Right, I'll talk you through it.

03:28.739 --> 03:29.572
You need to find gauze and forceps.

03:29.573 --> 03:30.573
Okay.

03:30.574 --> 03:31.541
And, Henry...

03:33.177 --> 03:34.477
Whatever you do,

03:34.478 --> 03:36.646
do not let her blood come
in contact with your skin.

03:38.248 --> 03:39.248
Right.

03:40.785 --> 03:42.285
I think the big guy's here.

03:45.589 --> 03:48.658
Kate, are you getting close?

04:03.273 --> 04:06.076
Easy, there, Gumby.

04:06.077 --> 04:09.312
It's just little old me.

04:19.223 --> 04:20.356
Kate, give me an update!

04:53.357 --> 04:55.091
Four tranqs and a concussion stun

04:55.092 --> 04:57.293
to take him down.

04:57.294 --> 04:59.295
Butt-ugly to boot.

04:59.296 --> 05:01.464
Yeah, big guy's got her now.

05:01.465 --> 05:04.300
They're on their way to you.

05:04.301 --> 05:05.701
Doc, she was so pale.

05:05.702 --> 05:07.536
I'll do everything I can.

05:07.537 --> 05:09.806
Oh, my God, Gerald!

05:09.807 --> 05:11.107
She was supposed to
meet him at the airport.

05:11.108 --> 05:12.142
I got to tell him...

05:12.143 --> 05:13.243
Henry.

05:13.244 --> 05:14.510
We'll call him.

05:14.511 --> 05:15.745
I you need to stay there.

05:15.746 --> 05:17.513
Scan and clean the room.

05:37.868 --> 05:41.437
So lizard boy here
releases toxic spores.

05:41.438 --> 05:42.605
Yeah, Henry's been
working with Rachel's team

05:42.606 --> 05:43.907
for about five years.

05:43.908 --> 05:45.574
Never heard of Jack releasing his spores

05:45.575 --> 05:47.243
Even once.

05:47.244 --> 05:48.711
He's supposed to be tame.

05:50.514 --> 05:51.681
Bad call.

05:54.885 --> 05:57.553
We do a c-spine, chest and abdomen.

05:57.554 --> 05:58.822
Ready.

05:58.823 --> 06:01.524
Give her one gram ceph.

06:01.525 --> 06:03.793
Increasing oxygen to 40%.

06:03.794 --> 06:07.197
Heart rate 98 and regular.

06:07.198 --> 06:10.599
Pupils are equal and reactive to light.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.368
Abdomen soft.

06:14.538 --> 06:15.638
Localizes to pain.

06:15.639 --> 06:16.639
Kidneys?

06:16.640 --> 06:18.541
Clear.

06:18.542 --> 06:20.009
Good.

06:20.010 --> 06:21.845
CBC, chem panel and gasses
are all within normal range.

06:21.846 --> 06:25.315
Now, to the wound.

06:27.551 --> 06:28.718
Oh, good.

06:28.719 --> 06:30.186
This one looks clean.

06:30.187 --> 06:31.855
Let's hope they all are.

06:35.192 --> 06:36.192
She's infected.

06:36.193 --> 06:37.927
Damnit, the spores are active.

06:37.928 --> 06:39.528
We need to get her into quarantine

06:39.529 --> 06:41.197
before I can operate.

06:41.198 --> 06:43.366
Hopefully I can get them
out before they multiply.

06:44.534 --> 06:45.902
Well, I have to try.

06:57.281 --> 06:59.949
All right, I'm finished
with the holographic scan,

06:59.950 --> 07:01.351
and I'm moving to the eradicator.

07:07.657 --> 07:11.227
All right, buddy, time to go to work.

07:23.340 --> 07:24.707
Dude, you left the door open.

07:24.708 --> 07:27.610
Yeah, I'm a little busy right now.

07:27.611 --> 07:28.945
Just finishing the DNA flame-out.

07:32.383 --> 07:33.616
You hear that?

07:36.720 --> 07:39.422
All right, french fries are done.

07:40.457 --> 07:42.425
Just bagging the goods now.

07:42.426 --> 07:43.492
Okay, head for the back alley.

07:43.493 --> 07:45.561
We'll pick you up on the fly-by.

07:45.562 --> 07:46.862
Just need a little more time.

07:46.863 --> 07:48.597
The cops are coming in the front door.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.234
I'm almost there.

07:51.235 --> 07:53.236
Get out!

07:53.237 --> 07:54.938
Never enough time.

07:54.939 --> 07:56.505
Get out now!

08:09.753 --> 08:11.687
Was Will able to get a hold of Gerald?

08:11.688 --> 08:13.356
On his way.

08:13.357 --> 08:15.258
Upset.

08:15.259 --> 08:16.459
Of course he is.

08:32.308 --> 08:33.741
There are too many.

08:33.743 --> 08:35.044
Dividing too quickly.

08:37.448 --> 08:38.780
Just stay sharp.

08:38.782 --> 08:39.881
You have your medicine bag?

08:39.883 --> 08:41.616
Yes.

08:41.618 --> 08:44.320
Let's hope we don't need it.

08:48.792 --> 08:50.759
Trying to domesticate
one of these things,

08:50.760 --> 08:52.428
that's like putting C-4

08:52.429 --> 08:53.762
through the Play-Doh fun factory.

08:53.763 --> 08:55.465
I don't know, it's cutting-edge stuff.

08:55.466 --> 08:57.033
Gerald focuses on its biochemistry

08:57.034 --> 08:58.767
while Rachel studies its behavior.

08:58.768 --> 08:59.768
They make a good team.

09:00.871 --> 09:02.372
What I've seen of Jack's behavior,

09:02.373 --> 09:04.507
he could still use
some obedience training.

09:04.508 --> 09:05.541
The last time I saw him with Rachel,

09:05.542 --> 09:06.876
he was pretty docile.

09:06.877 --> 09:08.911
She was even teaching him sign language.

09:08.912 --> 09:10.779
Well, hey, I'm no scientist,

09:10.780 --> 09:12.215
but you teach a deadly
abnormal how to talk,

09:12.216 --> 09:13.916
and all you'll get is a
deadly talking abnormal.

09:50.987 --> 09:52.755
This the thing that scanned the room?

09:52.756 --> 09:54.890
Don't do that.

09:54.891 --> 09:56.459
Need a hand?

09:56.460 --> 09:58.394
No, I'm good.

09:58.395 --> 10:01.097
I got a system.

10:01.098 --> 10:02.465
Oh, I get it.

10:02.466 --> 10:03.533
You can't go to the crime scene,

10:03.534 --> 10:05.435
So you bring the crime scene to you?

10:05.436 --> 10:06.669
Yeah, best we can.

10:08.472 --> 10:09.939
Do the cops have one of these gizmos?

10:09.940 --> 10:11.040
They wish they did.

10:11.041 --> 10:14.143
So how'd you come up with it?

10:14.144 --> 10:15.878
Will and me.

10:15.879 --> 10:19.715
His specs, my program, my design.

10:19.716 --> 10:21.050
Still a work in progress,

10:21.051 --> 10:22.485
but it's the best we've got right now.

10:22.486 --> 10:24.853
She a friend of yours?

10:26.957 --> 10:31.727
I mean, Magnus is on the job, so...

10:34.798 --> 10:36.532
Rachel and I worked together

10:36.533 --> 10:38.667
for about four years.

10:38.668 --> 10:40.769
She's been helping me
to understand who I am,

10:40.770 --> 10:45.040
What I am.

10:45.041 --> 10:46.576
She wasn't afraid of it.

10:46.577 --> 10:49.579
And the other guy is what, her husband?

10:50.981 --> 10:53.549
Yeah, he's like a brother to me.

10:59.089 --> 11:00.556
Where's Rachel, Henry?

11:00.557 --> 11:01.657
She's in the O.R.

11:01.658 --> 11:02.958
Is she...

11:02.959 --> 11:04.160
She's alive.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.196
Take me to her, please.

11:07.197 --> 11:08.464
Yeah.

11:14.037 --> 11:16.506
Blood pressure's falling.

11:16.507 --> 11:17.840
Give her a 500 bolus of saline.

11:19.143 --> 11:21.043
Last one in this wound.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.555
Oh, dear God.

11:32.556 --> 11:34.890
The infestation's spreading.

11:34.891 --> 11:36.626
We are too late.

11:36.627 --> 11:38.727
We can't save her.

11:38.728 --> 11:40.663
Dr. Magnus?

11:40.664 --> 11:43.065
No...

11:43.066 --> 11:44.833
Rachel...

11:44.834 --> 11:46.101
Gerald.

11:48.071 --> 11:51.240
I'm so sorry.

11:57.366 --> 11:59.700
I'm putting Rachel into stasis.

11:59.701 --> 12:01.669
To die?

12:01.670 --> 12:02.670
To slow down

12:02.671 --> 12:04.438
the progression of the spores,

12:04.439 --> 12:05.573
give me time to work on a treatment.

12:05.574 --> 12:07.475
There is no treatment.

12:07.476 --> 12:08.743
You know that.

12:08.744 --> 12:10.177
Once the host becomes infected,

12:10.178 --> 12:11.512
the spores regenerate
until the host is...

12:11.513 --> 12:13.514
I'm not ready to go there, not yet.

12:13.515 --> 12:15.783
I'm going to fight for
Rachel, but I need your help.

12:15.784 --> 12:17.752
What can I do?

12:17.753 --> 12:18.853
I need your research

12:18.854 --> 12:20.588
on Pleskidarsus spore regeneration.

12:20.589 --> 12:22.556
I may be able to create a reagent.

12:22.557 --> 12:25.893
But the chemical th... that
halts spore reproduction,

12:25.894 --> 12:26.994
it's far too...

12:26.995 --> 12:28.028
It's too caustic for human tissue,

12:28.029 --> 12:29.096
I know.

12:29.097 --> 12:30.865
I think I may be able to find a way

12:30.866 --> 12:32.566
to lessen the toxic side effects.

12:32.567 --> 12:33.934
Gerald...

12:33.935 --> 12:35.102
I need your research.

12:35.103 --> 12:36.737
You can use my set-up.

12:46.915 --> 12:48.616
Okay. Show me.

12:48.617 --> 12:50.150
Okay, come on.

12:53.555 --> 12:55.389
Henry's detailed scan
of everything in the lab

12:55.390 --> 12:58.025
corresponds to bar
codes on the cardboard.

12:58.026 --> 12:59.627
Now that we've recreated the scene,

12:59.628 --> 13:00.961
we can hopefully figure
out what happened.

13:00.962 --> 13:02.162
That's amazing...

13:03.565 --> 13:06.667
In, like, a total geeky kind of way.

13:06.668 --> 13:08.769
Wow, jealous much?

13:08.770 --> 13:10.838
No.

13:10.839 --> 13:12.773
All right, so you be Rachel, okay?

13:12.774 --> 13:13.808
Okay.

13:13.809 --> 13:15.443
So you enter here.

13:15.444 --> 13:17.177
Henry hears you say...

13:17.178 --> 13:18.446
Oh, my God?

13:18.447 --> 13:19.613
Correct.

13:19.614 --> 13:22.149
Uh, so I must see that you, Jack,

13:22.150 --> 13:23.617
are out of your enclosure.

13:23.618 --> 13:24.618
Right.

13:24.619 --> 13:25.986
So I must have smashed,

13:25.987 --> 13:27.888
forced my way out before you entered.

13:27.889 --> 13:29.590
I drop my cell phone.

13:29.591 --> 13:30.658
Do you rush at me?

13:30.659 --> 13:31.758
No,

13:31.759 --> 13:33.160
because the major
blood spatters are here.

13:33.161 --> 13:34.528
Oh, right, right,

13:34.529 --> 13:35.496
and the wounds are on
the front of her body,

13:35.497 --> 13:36.564
not the back.

13:36.565 --> 13:39.066
So for some reason, you approach me?

13:39.067 --> 13:40.434
No...

13:40.435 --> 13:41.936
No, the trajectory of the spatters...

13:41.937 --> 13:43.036
Yeah, it doesn't match the wound pattern

13:43.037 --> 13:44.872
on Rachel's body.

13:44.873 --> 13:46.106
Hmm...

13:46.107 --> 13:48.542
Okay, uh, stand over me,

13:48.543 --> 13:49.877
as if you're reaching for me.

13:49.878 --> 13:51.178
- Like this?
- Yeah.

13:51.179 --> 13:53.013
What do you think?

13:53.014 --> 13:53.948
Well, you know, it fits.

13:53.949 --> 13:55.449
Okay, so he's down here.

13:55.450 --> 13:56.917
She's reaching for him.

13:58.086 --> 14:00.554
Okay, well, the woman's
either crazy or stupid.

14:00.555 --> 14:03.557
I mean, monster is loose,
you move away from it.

14:03.558 --> 14:05.225
Yeah, unless she couldn't believe

14:05.226 --> 14:08.161
that he would hurt her.

14:08.162 --> 14:10.197
But she ends up over here.

14:10.198 --> 14:11.732
Why?

14:11.733 --> 14:14.535
Well, it attacks, she trips,

14:14.536 --> 14:16.604
slams into the drug cabinet.

14:16.605 --> 14:18.706
Yeah, and lands right here.

14:18.707 --> 14:19.874
And then it finishes the attack

14:19.875 --> 14:21.976
and splits out the window.

14:21.977 --> 14:23.777
Seems straightforward...

14:23.778 --> 14:24.879
Ish.

14:24.880 --> 14:25.913
Yeah.

14:25.914 --> 14:27.247
I don't know.

14:27.248 --> 14:30.885
Nothing about this seems
straightforward to me.

14:40.729 --> 14:42.195
She was so good to you.

14:44.566 --> 14:46.033
I don't care if you're hungry.

14:47.702 --> 14:48.969
Don't you realize what you did?

14:48.970 --> 14:51.271
You hurt Rachel, Jack.

14:52.974 --> 14:54.141
Yes, Rachel.

14:54.142 --> 14:56.209
You hurt her.

14:56.210 --> 14:58.045
Very bad.

14:58.046 --> 14:59.312
Bad Jack.

14:59.313 --> 15:01.281
Very bad. Bad Jack!

15:02.918 --> 15:04.018
Yeah.

15:04.019 --> 15:07.955
You got that right.

15:12.561 --> 15:14.094
Once I receive Gerald's data,

15:14.095 --> 15:15.796
I'll start working on the reagent.

15:15.797 --> 15:18.298
In any case, we'll have to
extract spores from Jack.

15:18.299 --> 15:20.801
How much time?

15:20.802 --> 15:22.369
Even in stasis,

15:22.370 --> 15:24.838
the tissue already damaged
by the spores will necrose.

15:24.839 --> 15:26.607
Her system won't be able to handle it

15:26.608 --> 15:28.008
for too much longer.

15:28.009 --> 15:29.743
Too young.

15:29.744 --> 15:33.280
By far.

15:33.281 --> 15:36.050
I'll collect the spores from Jack.

17:05.940 --> 17:07.708
Uh, just give me a
couple of minutes here.

17:07.709 --> 17:09.143
I'm...

17:09.144 --> 17:12.680
I'm downloading my files
from my home network.

17:12.681 --> 17:15.683
You need anything?

17:16.685 --> 17:19.252
Right. I'll just, uh...

17:19.252 --> 17:20.788
Look,
uh--

17:20.789 --> 17:22.122
I'm not blaming you.

17:22.123 --> 17:24.357
Yeah, I am.

17:24.358 --> 17:25.425
I should have been there.

17:25.425 --> 17:27.795
Henry...

17:27.796 --> 17:30.898
Not now, okay?

17:30.899 --> 17:32.432
I just, I can't.

17:32.433 --> 17:34.234
Okay, I'm sorry.

17:37.305 --> 17:39.006
She's everything to me.

17:42.811 --> 17:45.746
She's my life.

17:45.747 --> 17:47.314
She...

17:49.751 --> 17:51.952
Tell Magnus all the data she needs

17:51.953 --> 17:54.454
will be on her private
LAN in 10 minutes.

17:54.455 --> 17:55.723
Okay.

17:55.724 --> 17:58.458
Should give her a shot
at... God knows what.

18:00.128 --> 18:01.228
Gerald...

18:01.229 --> 18:03.897
just... just go.

19:00.245 --> 19:01.279
Stop!

19:01.280 --> 19:03.314
That's enough!

19:03.315 --> 19:04.315
Damned animal!

19:04.316 --> 19:05.416
What the hell, Ger?

19:05.417 --> 19:07.518
It killed her, Henry, it killed her!

19:07.519 --> 19:08.652
Hey, she has a chance.

19:08.653 --> 19:10.054
Nobody survives a Pleski attack.

19:10.055 --> 19:11.255
You know that and so do I.

19:11.256 --> 19:15.126
Ger, she has a chance.

19:15.127 --> 19:16.560
She's dead.

19:20.366 --> 19:21.499
Man...

19:27.473 --> 19:28.606
I'm guessing he took the weapon

19:28.607 --> 19:29.707
while he was working in Henry's lab.

19:29.708 --> 19:30.808
And the Pleski?

19:30.809 --> 19:33.077
It took a couple of bullets,

19:33.078 --> 19:34.445
but its skin is so tough,

19:34.446 --> 19:35.446
I don't think there should
be any permanent damage.

19:35.447 --> 19:36.614
The big guy's with him now.

19:36.615 --> 19:37.681
What about Gerald?

19:37.682 --> 19:38.716
He's a mess.

19:38.717 --> 19:41.819
Henry's with him.

19:41.820 --> 19:43.521
I should never have left him alone.

19:43.522 --> 19:44.855
Well, the guy works for you.

19:44.856 --> 19:46.090
I mean, there was no reason to think

19:46.091 --> 19:47.191
he was going to go that far.

19:47.192 --> 19:49.093
Still, it should never have happened.

19:49.094 --> 19:50.761
Assassination attempts aside,

19:50.762 --> 19:51.829
how goes it?

19:51.830 --> 19:53.064
Well, ironically,

19:53.065 --> 19:55.633
Gerald's research is
proving to be quite helpful.

19:55.634 --> 19:57.801
Take a look at this.

19:57.802 --> 19:59.437
Is this going to put me off my lunch?

19:59.438 --> 20:00.405
Now, watch.

20:10.582 --> 20:12.283
Huh.

20:12.284 --> 20:13.817
Well, that works.

20:13.818 --> 20:15.486
We just have to administer
the right amount,

20:15.487 --> 20:18.156
enough to kill the spores
without harming Rachel.

20:18.157 --> 20:19.357
Right, like chemo.

20:19.358 --> 20:21.058
But far more tricky to regulate.

20:21.059 --> 20:23.094
Have you figured out what
happened in the attack?

20:23.095 --> 20:24.228
No.

20:24.229 --> 20:25.563
Kate's got something
she wants me to see.

20:25.564 --> 20:28.232
I'm heading to the mock-up lab now.

20:29.435 --> 20:30.834
I know that look.

20:30.835 --> 20:32.870
Rachel taught Jack a
form of sign language,

20:32.871 --> 20:34.304
and I'm thinking of

20:34.305 --> 20:35.473
trying to communicate with him.

20:35.474 --> 20:37.241
Now, I know it's not a conventional way

20:37.242 --> 20:39.243
of gathering evidence,

20:39.244 --> 20:40.445
and I know what you're going to say,

20:40.446 --> 20:41.712
That if you could teach a lion to speak,

20:41.713 --> 20:42.746
You still wouldn't understand him...

20:42.747 --> 20:44.148
Your dad's favorite expression.

20:44.149 --> 20:45.349
Because...

20:45.350 --> 20:46.917
We often make the egocentric mistake

20:46.918 --> 20:48.686
of believing that abnormals
think the same way we do.

20:48.687 --> 20:50.621
That their worldview and logic patterns

20:50.622 --> 20:51.789
are similar.

20:51.790 --> 20:53.224
In most cases,

20:53.225 --> 20:54.325
even with the most intelligent species,

20:54.326 --> 20:55.460
they simply aren't.

20:55.461 --> 20:56.961
I know.

20:56.962 --> 20:57.528
Their whole cognitive
process is different.

20:57.529 --> 20:59.130
Yes.

20:59.131 --> 21:00.231
I'm...

21:00.232 --> 21:01.699
I'm just saying,

21:01.700 --> 21:03.767
bear that in mind when
you have your... chat.

21:04.903 --> 21:06.137
Okay.

21:09.641 --> 21:12.477
How could you just sit there?

21:12.478 --> 21:14.245
If that was your wife

21:14.246 --> 21:16.380
on that table...

21:16.381 --> 21:17.448
If the only person

21:17.449 --> 21:19.750
who really mattered to you was...

21:22.721 --> 21:25.623
I don't know where to
put all this, Henry.

21:26.858 --> 21:30.261
It lives and she dies?

21:31.563 --> 21:33.864
You tell me what you'd do.

21:33.865 --> 21:35.500
Honestly, Gerald, I
don't know what I'd do...

21:35.501 --> 21:37.235
You'd kill the damn thing!

21:37.236 --> 21:38.469
You'd go all werewolf,

21:38.470 --> 21:40.204
and you would take care of business!

21:40.205 --> 21:41.905
Wanting something and
doing something about it

21:41.906 --> 21:43.508
are two different things, Ger.

21:43.509 --> 21:44.808
Really?

21:44.809 --> 21:47.678
You've never done anything
crazy in the moment?

21:47.679 --> 21:49.947
Something maybe you shouldn't have done?

21:51.383 --> 21:52.517
This isn't about me.

21:52.518 --> 21:53.551
And Magnus says...

21:53.552 --> 21:54.552
I want to go down there

21:54.553 --> 21:57.455
in case she...

21:57.456 --> 22:00.625
I won't make any more trouble.

22:00.626 --> 22:04.362
I can't leave you on your own, man.

22:04.363 --> 22:07.298
Well, then you find someone else

22:07.299 --> 22:09.500
to watch over me.

22:09.501 --> 22:11.369
Just not you.

22:17.609 --> 22:20.611
Okay, tell me what you see from here.

22:20.612 --> 22:22.846
Okay, Rachel enters,

22:22.847 --> 22:24.448
she sees the Pleski is loose.

22:24.449 --> 22:26.417
Now, there's a tranq gun
right in front of her.

22:26.418 --> 22:28.219
Right, she had a defense.

22:28.220 --> 22:29.920
But she doesn't use it. Why?

22:29.921 --> 22:31.656
I'm thinking... because of this.

22:35.860 --> 22:38.696
Item 163, what's that?

22:38.697 --> 22:39.930
A syringe.

22:39.931 --> 22:41.299
Containing what?

22:41.300 --> 22:42.866
I don't know, but my guess is

22:42.867 --> 22:44.468
she was going for it when Jack attacked.

22:44.469 --> 22:45.969
Okay, good, so she was trying
to inject him with something.

22:45.970 --> 22:47.971
Uh-huh, and not a sedative,

22:47.972 --> 22:49.740
'cause that's in the tranq
gun, which she passes on.

22:49.741 --> 22:52.276
Okay, bing, bang, boom.

22:52.277 --> 22:54.011
Rachel enters, sees Jack is loose,

22:54.012 --> 22:55.746
ignores the tranq gun

22:55.747 --> 22:56.914
and heads straight for the drug cabinet.

22:56.915 --> 22:58.316
She drops the syringe
before she can use it,

22:58.317 --> 23:00.351
and now the big question is...

23:00.352 --> 23:01.452
What was in the syringe?

23:02.887 --> 23:04.288
What?

23:04.289 --> 23:05.789
Well...

23:05.790 --> 23:07.458
It's just that I'm not totally buying

23:07.459 --> 23:09.594
the whole ready-to-go
syringe theory.

23:11.363 --> 23:13.664
Item 73, what's that?

23:13.665 --> 23:14.732
Medicine of some kind.

23:14.733 --> 23:15.866
I don't know, I can't read the label.

23:15.867 --> 23:17.635
Huh...

23:17.636 --> 23:20.371
So whatever was in that vial...

23:20.372 --> 23:21.905
Was what she was trying
to inject Jack with.

23:21.906 --> 23:23.307
Right...

23:23.308 --> 23:25.042
Okay, I will talk to Henry.

23:25.043 --> 23:26.577
See if he can generate
a more detailed view

23:26.578 --> 23:27.945
of the 3-D scan.

23:27.946 --> 23:29.714
All right, I'm going
to go check on Gerald.

23:29.715 --> 23:30.548
Hey, Will...

23:30.549 --> 23:31.682
Yeah?

23:31.683 --> 23:32.816
This is what you did

23:32.817 --> 23:34.084
before you came here, right?

23:34.085 --> 23:36.987
Like fancy detective work, CSI stuff?

23:36.988 --> 23:38.556
Yeah...

23:38.557 --> 23:39.923
Look, in the real world,
forensics is under-staffed,

23:39.924 --> 23:41.459
under-funded, and
backlogged to the nines.

23:41.460 --> 23:43.327
Oh.

23:43.328 --> 23:45.028
Well, score one for the criminals, then.

23:45.029 --> 23:46.430
Put it this way,

23:46.431 --> 23:47.698
if I had this tech to work with,

23:47.699 --> 23:49.867
you'd have been behind bars years ago.

23:53.572 --> 23:54.872
No, I wouldn't.

23:54.873 --> 23:56.641
A new sign is deemed acquired

23:56.642 --> 23:58.976
only when reported by
three independent observers,

23:58.977 --> 24:00.043
Namely myself, Gerald, and...

24:00.044 --> 24:01.679
And, uh, me. Hi.

24:01.680 --> 24:02.713
I'm trying to be serious here.

24:02.714 --> 24:03.847
Yes, you should be very serious.

24:03.848 --> 24:04.915
It's very serious, don't laugh.

24:04.916 --> 24:05.916
I'm not!

24:05.917 --> 24:07.351
And don't smile.

24:07.352 --> 24:08.919
Now, you focus. Ready? Go.

24:08.920 --> 24:10.388
This woman is clearly insane.

24:10.389 --> 24:11.955
Do not believe a word that she says.

24:11.956 --> 24:13.324
Okay, yeah, anytime.

24:17.796 --> 24:18.996
You remembered.

24:18.997 --> 24:20.431
Ha ha! Ta-da!

24:20.432 --> 24:22.065
Watch out, watch out...

24:22.066 --> 24:23.467
Dude, that is clearly

24:23.468 --> 24:25.002
not going to feed three people.

24:25.003 --> 24:26.737
Then you can eat the melty bits.

24:26.738 --> 24:27.672
You're the best.

24:27.673 --> 24:29.507
Happy anniversary, baby.

24:29.508 --> 24:30.574
Oh, wow, awkward,

24:30.575 --> 24:31.609
and that's on film.

24:31.610 --> 24:32.943
I'm going to be sick.

24:32.944 --> 24:34.378
Okay, make a wish, make a wish...

24:36.348 --> 24:37.381
Done.

24:37.382 --> 24:38.683
Yay! The energy...

24:39.984 --> 24:41.752
The Gods have blessed this union.

24:41.753 --> 24:43.954
Wow...

24:43.955 --> 24:45.690
she's beautiful.

24:45.691 --> 24:46.957
What do you want?

24:49.628 --> 24:52.463
Need to ID something on the floor.

24:52.464 --> 24:53.664
Sector 34.

24:53.665 --> 24:54.898
Item 73.

24:56.501 --> 24:57.968
The label's hidden.

24:57.969 --> 24:59.203
I know.

24:59.204 --> 25:00.771
Looks like Rachel was
trying to inject the Pleski

25:00.772 --> 25:02.005
with something,

25:02.006 --> 25:03.541
though why she didn't
just tranq the sucker,

25:03.542 --> 25:04.842
I have no idea...

25:04.843 --> 25:05.743
Look, you don't know her, all right?

25:05.744 --> 25:06.744
Don't even try.

25:08.547 --> 25:09.613
Dude, just trying to solve a case here,

25:09.614 --> 25:10.581
that's all.

25:10.582 --> 25:11.982
It's fine.

25:11.983 --> 25:12.883
I'll enhance the area, and
I'll focus on the sector.

25:12.884 --> 25:15.619
Just give me an hour.

25:17.656 --> 25:19.390
Henry, I know she means a lot to you...

25:19.391 --> 25:20.924
Give me an hour.

25:25.129 --> 25:26.697
Right.

25:52.724 --> 25:55.092
Hi.

25:56.795 --> 25:58.028
I'm...

25:58.029 --> 25:59.797
I'm Will.

26:01.933 --> 26:03.033
Uh...

26:06.905 --> 26:09.106
I'm sorry, never mind.

26:12.977 --> 26:14.077
Are you hungry?

26:16.882 --> 26:18.649
You're hungry.

26:18.650 --> 26:20.918
But you have food.

26:20.919 --> 26:22.586
It's there.

26:24.890 --> 26:26.690
"Bad Jack?"

26:26.691 --> 26:28.459
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

26:28.460 --> 26:31.228
I don't understand.

26:48.012 --> 26:50.147
Anything?

26:50.148 --> 26:52.115
Still working on it.

26:52.116 --> 26:54.051
How was your chat with Jack?

26:54.052 --> 26:55.118
Huh...

26:55.119 --> 26:56.620
Turns out he doesn't have much to say,

26:56.621 --> 26:57.922
except I think he feels bad

26:57.923 --> 26:59.122
about what happened,

26:59.123 --> 27:01.759
which isn't very monster-like.

27:01.760 --> 27:02.960
I tried looking through the vial

27:02.961 --> 27:03.761
to the label on the other side.

27:03.762 --> 27:05.362
It didn't work.

27:05.363 --> 27:06.997
Look, if you look at that
piece of glass right there,

27:06.998 --> 27:08.131
it kind of acts like a mirror, right?

27:08.132 --> 27:09.767
Yeah.

27:09.768 --> 27:11.301
Well, if you focus on that sector,

27:11.302 --> 27:15.205
Kick up the rez, flip it around...

27:15.206 --> 27:16.273
Betamethasone.

27:16.274 --> 27:18.075
Betamethasone?

27:18.076 --> 27:19.944
What is that, some kind of sedative?

27:19.945 --> 27:21.946
No, it's just a common
immunosuppressant.

27:21.947 --> 27:23.280
Are you kidding me?

27:23.281 --> 27:24.715
She went for that over a tranq gun?

27:24.716 --> 27:26.617
There's got to be a good reason.

27:26.618 --> 27:28.719
Yeah, I'm betting there is.

27:46.705 --> 27:48.539
Hey.

27:50.842 --> 27:53.243
I've given her 30
milligrams of the reagent.

27:53.244 --> 27:54.277
We'll see how she responds

27:54.278 --> 27:56.079
to the treatment.

27:57.616 --> 28:02.019
We found something in Rachel's lab.

28:02.020 --> 28:03.988
I think she was trying to inject Jack

28:03.989 --> 28:05.723
with betamethasone.

28:05.724 --> 28:07.090
What? Are you certain?

28:07.091 --> 28:09.627
She was going for it
instead of the tranquilizers.

28:09.628 --> 28:10.895
Does that make any sense?

28:10.896 --> 28:12.262
Actually, it might,

28:12.263 --> 28:13.697
but it would suggest that Rachel knew

28:13.698 --> 28:15.566
that Jack's ACTH levels were too high.

28:15.567 --> 28:17.334
How so?

28:17.335 --> 28:20.671
In Siberia, the Pleski's native habitat,

28:20.672 --> 28:23.040
there's a rare fungus,
Cordyceps Siberienses.

28:23.041 --> 28:24.307
Now, when the Pleski's exposed

28:24.308 --> 28:25.609
to even small amounts,

28:25.610 --> 28:27.745
it increases their ACTH levels.

28:27.746 --> 28:29.914
Which over-stimulates the adrenals.

28:29.915 --> 28:31.281
Exactly.

28:31.282 --> 28:33.216
Now, Rachel's research
was based on the premise

28:33.217 --> 28:34.652
that the cordyceps fungus

28:34.653 --> 28:36.954
was the sole reason that
the Pleskidara are deadly,

28:36.955 --> 28:38.288
And that without its influence,

28:38.289 --> 28:40.223
they're a gentle, intelligent species.

28:40.224 --> 28:42.059
It was a controversial theory,

28:42.060 --> 28:43.326
even in the abnormal research community.

28:43.327 --> 28:45.128
Okay, so, wait.

28:45.129 --> 28:47.831
So if Jack was somehow
exposed to the fungus, then...

28:47.832 --> 28:50.034
It would explain how he
escaped from his enclosure.

28:50.035 --> 28:51.368
And why it took so many tranquilizers

28:51.369 --> 28:52.770
to bring him down.

28:52.771 --> 28:55.072
But why would he be
exposed in the first place?

28:55.073 --> 28:57.041
Could it have been a shipping container

28:57.042 --> 28:58.508
That was somehow contaminated?

28:58.509 --> 29:01.144
Knowing Gerald and Rachel,
that doesn't make any sense.

29:01.145 --> 29:02.479
They'd be so careful to screen for that.

29:02.480 --> 29:05.683
Well, I'll do a blood
test, check the ACTH levels.

29:05.684 --> 29:08.285
I'll talk with Gerald.

29:08.286 --> 29:09.853
Are you crazy?

29:09.854 --> 29:12.957
Of course we don't keep
cordyceps in our lab,

29:12.958 --> 29:15.258
or anything similar.

29:15.259 --> 29:16.627
There's a possibility
that Rachel suspected

29:16.628 --> 29:17.861
that Jack had been exposed.

29:17.862 --> 29:19.630
Can I cut into your Matlock speech here

29:19.631 --> 29:20.731
for a second?

29:20.732 --> 29:22.165
And pardon me, okay,

29:22.166 --> 29:24.267
but the Pleski attacked Rachel

29:24.268 --> 29:25.368
because of its nature,

29:25.369 --> 29:28.138
not because it was on drugs!

29:28.139 --> 29:32.375
She wanted to believe it was tame,

29:32.376 --> 29:34.945
but you can't take an
instinctive predator

29:34.946 --> 29:37.881
and teach it to love people.

29:37.882 --> 29:39.049
You and Rachel must have had

29:39.050 --> 29:40.250
some very interesting
discussions about this.

29:40.251 --> 29:42.152
What do you mean?

29:42.153 --> 29:44.722
Her work was spent trying to prove

29:44.723 --> 29:47.424
that the Pleskidara could be socialized,

29:47.425 --> 29:49.026
and yet you, quite obviously,

29:49.027 --> 29:50.694
believe the opposite.

29:50.695 --> 29:53.196
I support her in her work.

29:53.197 --> 29:54.464
I just...

29:54.465 --> 29:55.866
Don't let her know

29:55.867 --> 29:58.068
that I think it's completely useless.

29:58.069 --> 30:00.004
And yet you allowed
her to continue working

30:00.005 --> 30:01.672
with a dangerous species?

30:01.673 --> 30:03.007
Come on, Magnus, you
know Rachel, all right.

30:03.008 --> 30:04.307
She's made up her mind about something,

30:04.308 --> 30:06.176
that's, you know...

30:06.177 --> 30:07.878
She's a very able researcher.

30:07.879 --> 30:11.948
Yeah, I admire her passion, I do.

30:13.685 --> 30:15.686
But she spent more
time with the creature

30:15.687 --> 30:16.887
than she did with you.

30:21.359 --> 30:25.195
Yeah, she did.

30:27.866 --> 30:33.470
I thought this... getaway would, uh...

30:33.471 --> 30:35.139
Would help change things.

30:35.140 --> 30:39.109
Maybe if we spent a little
more time together, I...

30:39.110 --> 30:40.443
But now...

30:44.015 --> 30:47.151
What if she dies?

30:50.021 --> 30:53.323
What happens?

30:53.324 --> 30:55.258
Another able researcher gets hired,

30:55.259 --> 30:56.727
and we all continue
on playing with "Jack"?

30:56.728 --> 30:58.095
Is that what happens?

30:58.096 --> 31:01.732
We're testing his blood for ACTH levels.

31:01.733 --> 31:05.803
If the results are negative...

31:05.804 --> 31:07.771
I'll lock him away for good.

31:09.273 --> 31:10.974
Of course you will.

31:12.343 --> 31:14.812
Excuse me.

31:20.885 --> 31:23.253
She's been stable for more than an hour.

31:23.254 --> 31:24.287
Good news?

31:24.288 --> 31:25.823
Possibly.

31:25.824 --> 31:27.157
She's out of quarantine?

31:29.194 --> 31:32.329
I don't want to create false hope,

31:32.330 --> 31:34.464
but the rate of spore division
has diminished significantly.

31:34.465 --> 31:36.466
You're certain?

31:36.467 --> 31:38.802
They're beginning to die.

31:38.803 --> 31:41.772
We believe she's no longer contagious.

31:48.546 --> 31:50.247
She's flat-lined.

31:50.248 --> 31:52.349
There are toxins in her bloodstream.

31:52.350 --> 31:54.451
The treatment's killing her.

31:59.194 --> 32:00.194
Second epi in.

32:00.195 --> 32:01.795
Charging to 300.

32:01.796 --> 32:02.629
Epi in.

32:02.630 --> 32:04.665
No, let them work.

32:04.666 --> 32:05.666
Come on, fight!

32:05.667 --> 32:07.668
- Charged.
- Clear.

32:07.669 --> 32:08.970
Time.

32:08.971 --> 32:10.904
Four minutes.

32:10.905 --> 32:13.540
I've given her epinephrine,
atropine, shocked her...

32:13.541 --> 32:15.609
Seven times.

32:17.245 --> 32:19.080
No...

32:21.850 --> 32:23.150
We need an alternative.

32:23.151 --> 32:24.952
Too risky.

32:24.953 --> 32:26.553
She's dead either way.

32:39.201 --> 32:42.236
What are they giving her?

32:51.213 --> 32:52.746
Rachel!

32:57.486 --> 32:58.886
Hold on.

33:07.496 --> 33:08.795
Normal sinus.

33:08.796 --> 33:11.032
Lucky.

33:12.767 --> 33:14.635
Thank God.

33:14.636 --> 33:15.802
I need blood, cardiac

33:15.803 --> 33:18.739
and liver panels.

33:18.740 --> 33:20.707
The reagent's taking its toll

33:20.708 --> 33:22.776
on her system.

33:22.777 --> 33:24.245
We'll keep her monitored,

33:24.246 --> 33:26.514
but I can't guarantee that
the treatment won't kill her

33:26.515 --> 33:29.716
before it runs its course.

33:29.717 --> 33:31.018
I'd like to be with her.

33:32.754 --> 33:35.289
Alone.

33:55.210 --> 33:56.777
How's Rachel?

33:56.778 --> 33:58.679
Alive, for now.

33:58.680 --> 34:01.014
You should see this.

34:01.015 --> 34:02.816
Jack's blood results.

34:02.817 --> 34:05.652
The ACTH levels are higher than normal,

34:05.653 --> 34:06.853
dropping from a previous spike.

34:06.854 --> 34:08.155
I'm checking his food remains

34:08.156 --> 34:10.924
for traces of this Siberian fungus.

34:10.925 --> 34:12.092
Well, why his food?

34:12.094 --> 34:13.260
Rachel would be

34:13.261 --> 34:14.594
the most careful about that,

34:14.596 --> 34:15.596
I should think.

34:15.597 --> 34:16.663
Um...

34:16.664 --> 34:18.299
The Pleski told him.

34:20.735 --> 34:22.303
He kept making the sign for "eat."

34:22.304 --> 34:24.105
Look, I tried to think

34:24.106 --> 34:26.139
outside of my egocentric
way of communicating,

34:26.141 --> 34:29.310
but I'm wondering if
Jack maybe somehow knew

34:29.311 --> 34:30.744
that his food was being poisoned.

34:30.745 --> 34:32.846
Or it's just hungry.

34:32.847 --> 34:35.916
He hasn't eaten anything
since he got here.

34:37.085 --> 34:38.752
Let me know what you find.

34:42.224 --> 34:43.290
Magnus...

34:44.659 --> 34:47.761
It doesn't look good.

34:55.237 --> 34:57.804
It's stupid.

34:57.805 --> 34:59.773
I was going to surprise you.

35:01.976 --> 35:04.978
This trip wasn't to
Blackpool for a convention.

35:04.979 --> 35:06.713
It was, uh...

35:06.714 --> 35:10.151
To Paris.

35:10.152 --> 35:17.958
A real honeymoon. Finally.

35:17.959 --> 35:19.193
This shouldn't have happened.

35:19.194 --> 35:20.361
It shouldn't have been...

35:28.370 --> 35:31.172
Can I have a private
moment with my wife, Henry?

35:31.173 --> 35:35.276
I know, Ger. I'm sorry.

35:35.277 --> 35:36.743
This is my fault.

35:36.744 --> 35:39.880
I can't spend two minutes with her

35:39.881 --> 35:43.350
without you showing up.

35:43.351 --> 35:47.321
I can't take her to a movie

35:47.322 --> 35:50.090
because you two have already seen it.

35:50.091 --> 35:52.293
First it's coffee with Henry,

35:52.294 --> 35:54.094
and then it's a dinner here and there.

35:54.095 --> 35:56.930
Pretty soon it's all about
whether or not you're available.

35:59.234 --> 36:00.934
You know that she actually blushes

36:00.935 --> 36:02.336
when you walk into a room,

36:02.337 --> 36:04.805
and you know it,

36:04.806 --> 36:08.175
and you insult me every time,

36:08.176 --> 36:10.744
pretending that it wasn't happening.

36:10.745 --> 36:12.413
She's with you, Ger, not me.

36:12.414 --> 36:13.714
I never did anything.

36:13.715 --> 36:15.148
You don't have to, Henry, you are...

36:15.149 --> 36:17.851
You're everything that
she wants me to be.

36:30.198 --> 36:33.133
But I took care of things.

36:34.802 --> 36:37.804
Something had to be done.

36:44.212 --> 36:46.447
Mystery of the amped-up lizard

36:46.448 --> 36:49.283
solved.

36:49.284 --> 36:50.317
Damn.

36:50.318 --> 36:51.285
Yeah.

36:51.286 --> 36:52.386
Last three feedings

36:52.387 --> 36:55.122
were rife with delicious
Siberian fungus.

36:55.123 --> 36:57.023
You did this.

36:57.024 --> 37:00.461
You made this happen?

37:00.462 --> 37:02.263
This is Rachel!

37:03.898 --> 37:05.999
You're such an idiot, Henry.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.134
Only two people

37:07.135 --> 37:08.902
had access to his food supply.

37:08.903 --> 37:10.371
So unless blondie was going for

37:10.372 --> 37:12.473
suicide by Pleski...

37:12.474 --> 37:14.040
Where's Gerald right now?

37:14.041 --> 37:19.179
I wasn't trying to kill Rachel.

37:19.180 --> 37:21.181
I was trying to kill you.

37:21.182 --> 37:24.351
Oh, man, don't.

37:24.352 --> 37:25.786
Come on, Henry.

37:25.787 --> 37:28.054
Let's see your real face, huh?

37:28.055 --> 37:29.122
No!

37:35.373 --> 37:37.441
No!

37:37.442 --> 37:39.176
It's all right, buddy, let it come.

37:40.211 --> 37:41.244
No!

37:41.245 --> 37:42.245
Don't...

37:45.684 --> 37:47.451
Come on, Henry, turn!

37:47.452 --> 37:48.619
One of us is checking out, Henry,

37:48.620 --> 37:50.053
and if you stay human, it'll be you!

37:50.054 --> 37:52.422
Don't do this.

37:52.423 --> 37:53.290
Come on!

37:53.291 --> 37:55.459
Gerald, that is enough!

37:55.460 --> 37:57.394
Drop it.

38:00.064 --> 38:02.432
Look at her.

38:04.202 --> 38:06.470
I don't want to live when she's gone.

38:08.740 --> 38:10.240
Oh, but you'd take care of that, though,

38:10.241 --> 38:11.408
wouldn't you, buddy boy?

38:11.409 --> 38:12.710
Huh?

38:12.711 --> 38:13.844
If I just mess you up just a little bit,

38:13.845 --> 38:15.178
you'd take care of business.

38:15.179 --> 38:16.680
You'd take care of me, wouldn't you?

38:16.681 --> 38:18.549
Stop...

38:18.550 --> 38:19.617
Then you'd have to live with it!

38:19.618 --> 38:20.651
Gerald!

38:20.652 --> 38:22.686
Think logically.

38:22.687 --> 38:25.155
You do not want to take this action.

38:28.727 --> 38:30.293
Come on, freak!

38:32.764 --> 38:34.732
She's crashing again!

38:43.542 --> 38:45.576
Doc, is she...

38:52.684 --> 38:54.585
she's stabilizing.

38:58.590 --> 39:00.457
Are you okay?

39:05.263 --> 39:08.432
No.

39:12.170 --> 39:13.403
So...

39:13.404 --> 39:15.439
How does someone recover

39:15.440 --> 39:17.775
from something like this?

39:17.776 --> 39:21.612
By not blaming yourself
for what happened.

39:21.613 --> 39:24.514
Our marriage wasn't working.

39:24.515 --> 39:26.349
I should have said something.

39:26.350 --> 39:27.785
I should have stopped myself.

39:27.786 --> 39:30.487
From what, feeling things?

39:30.488 --> 39:32.923
I'm sure you tried at
some point or another,

39:32.924 --> 39:35.258
but that doesn't work.

39:35.259 --> 39:37.561
I can come back.

39:37.562 --> 39:39.463
No, no.

39:39.464 --> 39:41.398
We'll... we'll talk later.

39:47.806 --> 39:48.906
Hey, you.

39:48.907 --> 39:50.307
Hey.

39:50.308 --> 39:54.144
Ow.

39:54.145 --> 39:55.879
Wow, you look terrible.

39:55.880 --> 39:57.447
Where the hell's your make-up bag?

39:57.448 --> 39:59.750
Stop it.

39:59.751 --> 40:01.852
Yeah...

40:01.853 --> 40:04.321
You see, that's the problem.

40:04.322 --> 40:06.490
I can't.

40:06.491 --> 40:09.392
You and I got too close, Rachel,

40:09.393 --> 40:10.661
and I went there willingly.

40:10.662 --> 40:14.865
Because I gave you permission.

40:16.835 --> 40:20.504
I don't know why I...

40:20.505 --> 40:21.639
I think I was afraid to admit

40:21.640 --> 40:25.275
that I'd made a mistake with Gerald.

40:25.276 --> 40:26.977
I chose the wrong person.

40:26.978 --> 40:30.614
No, you're not in love with me, Rachel.

40:30.615 --> 40:31.949
I'm just the third wheel
to keep you guys upright

40:31.950 --> 40:33.517
while you figured things out,

40:33.518 --> 40:36.586
and I bought in too much.

40:36.587 --> 40:41.391
You really don't think
that's all you were to me?

40:41.392 --> 40:45.663
Henry...

40:45.664 --> 40:50.600
I am in love with you.

40:53.738 --> 40:57.274
Then why did you marry him?

40:57.275 --> 40:59.576
Because he was the one who asked.

40:59.577 --> 41:01.679
Because you were always too scared

41:01.680 --> 41:05.448
to open up to me.

41:05.449 --> 41:07.851
Is it because of what you are?

41:07.852 --> 41:11.689
Did you think I wouldn't accept that?

41:17.328 --> 41:19.429
Oh, my God...

41:20.999 --> 41:22.299
You don't love me.

41:25.570 --> 41:27.738
Rachel...

41:27.739 --> 41:32.943
we... can't be together.

41:32.944 --> 41:34.978
Henry...

41:34.979 --> 41:39.382
Because Gerald's my friend, and...

41:39.383 --> 41:42.485
I'm so sorry.

42:10.314 --> 42:11.715
I know what you're going to say,

42:11.716 --> 42:13.917
and you're totally
right. It's all on me.

42:13.918 --> 42:15.018
Not all,

42:15.019 --> 42:18.288
but enough.

42:22.326 --> 42:23.994
I know you thought
you were helping Rachel

42:23.995 --> 42:25.528
and her relationship with Gerald, but...

42:25.529 --> 42:26.663
I was just making it worse.

42:28.767 --> 42:30.901
I just wanted to be there for her.

42:30.902 --> 42:33.336
You know, be someone she could count on.

42:33.337 --> 42:34.437
Be a friend.

42:35.974 --> 42:37.775
But things changed.

42:39.811 --> 42:40.944
Yeah.

42:43.081 --> 42:45.448
That's usually when
it's best to come clean.

42:47.418 --> 42:48.919
You can't let who you are

42:48.920 --> 42:52.322
keep you from getting
close to people, Henry.

42:58.396 --> 43:01.098
Hey, Doc...

43:01.099 --> 43:04.000
Thank you for saving her.
