WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:10.000
This programme contains
some strong language.

00:23.080 --> 00:24.760
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:33.440 --> 00:36.320
Hello and welcome
to a sick episode of QI,

00:36.320 --> 00:38.720
where we'll be
sneezing and sniffling,

00:38.720 --> 00:41.120
but always socially distancing,
of course.

00:41.120 --> 00:44.000
I think our guest list this evening
must be some sort of sick joke.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.400
They are - sick as a parrot,
it's Jo Brand.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.040
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:49.040 --> 00:51.120
Sick as a dog, it's Maisie Adam.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.560
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:53.560 --> 00:55.680
Sick as a pig, it's Lee Mack.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.280
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:55.680 --> 00:58.280
Hello.

00:58.280 --> 01:01.200
And sick as a blue whale,
it's Alan Davies.

01:01.200 --> 01:04.200
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

01:04.200 --> 01:07.160
And their buzzers don't sound
quite themselves.

01:07.160 --> 01:08.680
Jo goes...

01:08.680 --> 01:11.560
MAN GROANS

01:11.560 --> 01:12.800
Maisie goes...

01:12.800 --> 01:16.720
MAN RETCHES, STOMACH GURGLES

01:16.720 --> 01:18.480
Lee goes...

01:18.480 --> 01:21.880
MAN COUGHS AND VOMITS

01:23.880 --> 01:25.720
And Alan goes...

01:25.720 --> 01:27.840
Mate, that is well sick!

01:27.840 --> 01:30.720
LAUGHTER

01:30.720 --> 01:32.520
Right, on with the questions.

01:32.520 --> 01:39.000
Which weirdo genius left
a plague zone to test his eyesight?

01:39.000 --> 01:41.040
MAN GROANS

01:41.040 --> 01:43.880
Mine sounds the most like sex,
doesn't it?

01:43.880 --> 01:48.040
Well, my kind of... I was going
to say, not to me, Jo. No.

01:48.040 --> 01:51.480
That's quite an insight, there.
To me, sadly.

01:51.480 --> 01:55.280
I was going to say possibly some
kind of wanker.

01:55.280 --> 01:57.840
LAUGHTER

01:57.840 --> 02:00.080
I mean, you can't... No, no, no,

02:00.080 --> 02:03.160
just because
he's got failing eyesight

02:03.160 --> 02:06.000
and that's what they say,
isn't it, if you...? If you...?

02:06.000 --> 02:10.200
Oh, I see! It's a bold statement
for the only person wearing glasses.

02:10.200 --> 02:11.760
LAUGHTER

02:14.280 --> 02:16.000
"Who said that?"

02:16.000 --> 02:18.240
LAUGHTER

02:18.240 --> 02:21.080
Did you want to say something?
Dominic Cummings. Dominic Cummings!

02:21.080 --> 02:23.440
KLAXON

02:25.400 --> 02:28.840
He did what any good father
would do! Yes.

02:28.840 --> 02:30.600
As the age-old saying goes,

02:30.600 --> 02:33.840
if your eyes are given your hassle,
drive to Barnard Castle.

02:33.840 --> 02:36.520
LAUGHTER

02:36.520 --> 02:39.680
When was there a plague before?

02:39.680 --> 02:41.840
The bubonic plague?
Yeah, the Great Plague.

02:41.840 --> 02:44.680
Round about 1380-something,
wasn't there?

02:44.680 --> 02:48.440
Wasn't there one more recent
than that? 17th century? 1665.

02:48.440 --> 02:50.400
Yes, yes! A point!

02:50.400 --> 02:54.600
1665. Yes, I know, right?

02:50.400 --> 02:54.600
APPLAUSE

02:56.280 --> 02:57.840
I retire.

02:57.840 --> 03:02.200
I knew what century
the Great Plague was in. Come on!

03:02.200 --> 03:05.120
A plague swept the south-east
of England and Sir Isaac Newton

03:05.120 --> 03:09.840
fled Cambridge and shut himself up
at the family farm at Woolsthorpe.

03:09.840 --> 03:13.880
So what do we know about Newton?
Theory of...? The apple on his head.

03:13.880 --> 03:17.160
It's gravity, isn't it? Except that
didn't happen. It was a myth. What?!

03:17.160 --> 03:20.960
That apple thing's a myth?! Are you
telling me the apple went up?

03:20.960 --> 03:24.160
He propagated it as a bit of a myth,
the story about the apple, but it is

03:24.160 --> 03:27.000
from exactly the same time. So
his theory of gravity is from then.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.840
But he also studied optics

03:28.840 --> 03:31.120
and he wanted to work out
how the eye worked.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.400
And this was a guy who was
fully committed, OK?

03:33.400 --> 03:36.960
So in order to work it out,
he took a bodkin,

03:36.960 --> 03:38.840
which is like a little hatpin,

03:38.840 --> 03:43.160
and put it between... No.
..his eyeball... No.

03:43.160 --> 03:48.240
..and the socket to see what effect
that would have on his vision. Why?!

03:48.240 --> 03:49.720
This is very coincidental.

03:49.720 --> 03:52.680
Only a week ago, this is genuinely
true, I had to have a tear duct...

03:52.680 --> 03:54.480
Have you ever had it flushed?

03:54.480 --> 03:57.080
No. They basically get a syringe.

03:57.080 --> 04:00.880
The needle, I kid you not, is about
that big, but it bends, right?

04:00.880 --> 04:04.160
And I didn't have any clue what was
going to happen to me,

04:04.160 --> 04:07.320
and then the reason I knew this was
going to be painful is because

04:07.320 --> 04:09.880
a lady came in, and without asking,

04:09.880 --> 04:11.640
she held my hand.

04:11.640 --> 04:14.040
Oh, that's when you know.
And I went, "What are you doing?"

04:14.040 --> 04:15.600
She went, "Just holding your hand."

04:15.600 --> 04:17.120
Just in case. Bang!

04:17.120 --> 04:19.920
Yeah. It was the most painful thing
imaginable.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.960
And then they pushed the saline
through,

04:21.960 --> 04:24.720
and you feel it in your throat
when it - pop - it's unblocked.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.920
What was...?
You could no longer show emotion?

04:26.920 --> 04:29.240
I was constantly crying
out of this eye,

04:29.240 --> 04:31.880
and this was emotionally northern
and depressed.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.960
It felt like I was very upset about
things,

04:33.960 --> 04:35.480
but only at this side of my face.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.640
They could have just made you
watch ET

04:37.640 --> 04:40.160
or an episode
of Little House On The Prairie.

04:40.160 --> 04:42.480
Nice topical reference for you!

04:42.480 --> 04:44.920
Anyway, he poked around
and apparently it does

04:44.920 --> 04:47.240
affect your eyesight,
affected what colours he saw,

04:47.240 --> 04:49.200
and he could see spots
before his eyes and so on,

04:49.200 --> 04:51.800
and I think that's kind of a
dedication to his work right there.

04:51.800 --> 04:54.120
Wow. And years immediately
following the plague,

04:54.120 --> 04:56.680
he studied the best way to cure
the disease and he decided

04:56.680 --> 05:01.560
the best option -
to make toad vomit lozenges.

05:01.560 --> 05:05.320
Anybody want the recipe?
Yes, please. OK, so first of all,

05:05.320 --> 05:09.400
hang your toad upside down in the
chimney for three days, OK? What?

05:09.400 --> 05:12.040
I hope that's not a euphemism.
In the chimney?

05:12.040 --> 05:15.760
He was full of ideas. I know.
With the fire going underneath it?

05:15.760 --> 05:18.600
It doesn't say, it doesn't say
about the fire. Just says,

05:18.600 --> 05:22.920
"Collect vomit emitted before
it dies on a dish of yellow wax.

05:22.920 --> 05:26.160
"Be sure to include the detritus
from the bottom of your fireplace" -

05:26.160 --> 05:27.920
so bits of ash and so on -

05:27.920 --> 05:32.480
"and then grind the vomit with the
frog remains and form lozenges."

05:32.480 --> 05:35.520
And then you place the lozenges
around the affected body parts.

05:35.520 --> 05:38.680
And the idea is the tablets would
draw the poison out of the body.

05:38.680 --> 05:42.000
So they're not lozenges to suck,
then? No. How disappointing.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
Yes, I know. Right?
Who doesn't want a toad lozenge?

05:45.000 --> 05:47.840
At some point, he must have said to
his mate, "Do you know what

05:47.840 --> 05:50.600
"I've discovered? That toads
will only vomit in a chimney."

05:50.600 --> 05:53.760
Yeah, how many times do you reckon
his mates had conversations

05:53.760 --> 05:56.320
behind his back? Like,
"We're worried about Isaac,

05:56.320 --> 05:58.240
"he's put toads in the chimney
again."

05:58.240 --> 06:00.160
Anyway, do you think it worked?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.080
No. No, of course not. Yeah. Oh.

06:02.080 --> 06:04.880
It's a time when mysticism
and alchemy were pretty much

06:04.880 --> 06:07.240
indistinguishable
from chemistry and biology.

06:07.240 --> 06:11.080
So it was just his best guess.
I have to say that the prescription

06:11.080 --> 06:13.480
was not worthless
because it was sold.

06:13.480 --> 06:18.360
The handwritten recipe by Newton was
sold at Bonhams in 2020 for Â£60,000.

06:18.360 --> 06:21.040
So... In 2020?
Quite ironic, isn't it, really,

06:21.040 --> 06:24.480
given what he was like
with his eyes? 20/20. Yeah.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.760
LAUGHTER

06:27.840 --> 06:30.680
The similarities between the 2020
coronavirus epidemic

06:30.680 --> 06:33.520
and the Great Plague of 1665
are sort of startling.

06:33.520 --> 06:36.560
So King Charles II, he shut down the
pubs, he shut down the universities,

06:36.560 --> 06:38.280
he banned most public gatherings.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.920
Every day, the death tolls
were publicly posted.

06:40.920 --> 06:44.920
Mourning was limited. What
about afternoon? Ha-ha-ha! Sorry.

06:44.920 --> 06:47.440
LAUGHTER

06:47.440 --> 06:50.280
And, actually, plague doctors
sort of wore PPE,

06:50.280 --> 06:54.000
it's the rather famous mask...
There it is, the beaked mask,

06:54.000 --> 06:56.800
and it probably worked.
It's a bit like face masks today.

06:56.800 --> 07:00.600
I mean, incorrectly, they thought
it was the sweet-smelling perfume

07:00.600 --> 07:03.560
that you placed in the beak that
protected them from the bad smells.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.840
Oh, I thought that was
a socially distancing thing.

07:05.840 --> 07:08.880
That's not foolish... Surprisingly,
that is exactly right.

07:08.880 --> 07:12.280
Well, then, don't use it in the
edit, I've got my brand to think of.

07:12.280 --> 07:15.160
LAUGHTER

07:15.160 --> 07:17.600
You've got a brand, darling?
Of course. Paddy McGuinness

07:17.600 --> 07:20.640
can't do those Greggs adverts
forever.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.960
LAUGHTER

07:22.960 --> 07:25.800
And they also wore thick gloves
and they had long sleeves and stuff,

07:25.800 --> 07:28.760
basically preventing
fleas from biting their skin.

07:28.760 --> 07:32.480
Now, who has shooting stars
coming out of their bottom?

07:32.480 --> 07:35.160
Are you...? What? Oh, this is
a question. I thought you had...

07:35.160 --> 07:36.760
It's a philosophical question.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.720
I thought you were being
very middle class and

07:38.720 --> 07:40.080
you wanted to know who's farted.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.760
Yes, I say, who's got shooting stars
coming out of their bottom?

07:42.760 --> 07:44.960
What do you call it in your family,
with the children?

07:44.960 --> 07:46.640
Like, my family called it trumping.

07:46.640 --> 07:49.800
We say pumps. Pumps. I'm old school.
I say fart. Yeah.

07:49.800 --> 07:53.520
But, you know, they like to say
bottom burp. "Who's bottom burped?"

07:53.520 --> 07:55.520
I go, "Not me, I farted."

07:55.520 --> 07:57.720
LAUGHTER

07:57.720 --> 08:00.640
And we've got a dog now and you know
how smelly their farts can be.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.800
Yeah. And you can't call that
a bottom burp,

08:02.800 --> 08:05.480
it's too nice and delicate a word,
isn't it, for what they do?

08:05.480 --> 08:08.760
It's nuclear. We call it attempted
murder. Yeah, it is, isn't it?

08:08.760 --> 08:11.200
Shooting stars out of the bottom?

08:11.200 --> 08:15.880
Well, I could imagine that I might
have had a row with Vic Reeves

08:15.880 --> 08:18.800
when we were pissed
and he might have shoved a DVD up

08:18.800 --> 08:21.640
and then had to pull it out again.
I don't know.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.760
One of Jo's crazy nights out.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.840
LAUGHTER

08:25.840 --> 08:28.120
We're up in space.

08:28.120 --> 08:31.720
We're up in space.
Shooting stars out the backside.

08:31.720 --> 08:35.520
Is it what methane does
when it reacts with a vacuum?

08:35.520 --> 08:38.520
Wow. That's VERY scientific.
What happened to that brand?

08:38.520 --> 08:39.960
Oh, God. I know.

08:39.960 --> 08:43.320
NORTHERN ACCENT: Eh, is it a fat
bloke who's eaten

08:43.320 --> 08:45.280
too many silver star biscuits?

08:45.280 --> 08:46.920
LAUGHTER

08:46.920 --> 08:49.640
Much better, Lee. Use that one.

08:49.640 --> 08:52.920
So the International Space Station
has had a lavatory upgrade.

08:52.920 --> 08:54.280
Here it is. Look at that.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.720
It's called the
Universal Waste Management System

08:56.720 --> 09:00.440
and it cost $23 million.

09:00.440 --> 09:04.600
That costs $23 million? For one?
So, yeah, for one. Yeah.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.480
Everybody has to share, up on
the International Space Station.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.200
Here is the thing. This particular
toilet has the ability

09:10.200 --> 09:15.640
to sort faecal bits from the rest
of the waste to allow the liquid

09:15.640 --> 09:18.160
to be recycled... 23 million?!

09:18.160 --> 09:21.040
Wait...
You can buy a sieve for 4.99.

09:21.040 --> 09:25.000
Well... What are they recycling it
as? No, no, don't you dare.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.400
They're recycling the liquid as...

09:27.400 --> 09:28.880
Lucozade.

09:28.880 --> 09:32.800
Water. Drinking water. Drinking
water. Drinking water.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.280
No, no. For them on the spaceship?
Mm. Oh, come on.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.280
No, for the royal family!

09:37.280 --> 09:39.560
LAUGHTER

09:39.560 --> 09:42.000
That's unbelievable.
It is unbelievable.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.800
But the good news is if you're a
woman and you want to go into space,

09:44.800 --> 09:46.760
there is an improvement
for women astronauts.

09:46.760 --> 09:49.160
There's now a funnel
especially designed for women

09:49.160 --> 09:51.760
and they're a sort of - how can I
put this? - there's, like, ridges

09:51.760 --> 09:54.040
to help women position themselves.

09:54.040 --> 09:57.880
But we still haven't found
a truly unisex lavatory

09:57.880 --> 09:59.280
that works for everybody.

09:59.280 --> 10:01.760
Are they holding their personal
toilet? They're all... Yes.

10:01.760 --> 10:05.000
Where is the...? Where are the
ridges? On the inside of the...

10:05.000 --> 10:08.040
So the women have to, yes, position
their bottom exactly right.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.520
Where are the ridges?
So there is a serious issue, OK -

10:11.520 --> 10:15.120
the old toilet did not allow
astronauts to urinate and defecate

10:15.120 --> 10:18.240
at the same time. And that is more
difficult for women to control.

10:18.240 --> 10:22.360
It's just a thing. Can we just do
a quick sort of straw poll? Mm.

10:22.360 --> 10:25.840
Is it difficult for you not to
defecate when you've had a piss?

10:25.840 --> 10:30.000
Sorry, can I just check, Jo,
have you been speed dating before?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.720
LAUGHTER

10:32.720 --> 10:34.360
"Can I just check,

10:34.360 --> 10:37.680
"do you find it difficult to
defecate and piss at the same time?

10:37.680 --> 10:40.440
"No? You're in, get your coat,
you've pulled." I was so excited

10:40.440 --> 10:42.800
about being on this show.
I told my mum and dad, they said,

10:42.800 --> 10:45.240
"Oh, you're on with Jo Brand?
Let me know what she's like."

10:45.240 --> 10:48.720
I'm going to tell her. "You'll never
guess what that she asked me, Mum."

10:48.720 --> 10:53.880
If women defecate, they nearly
always urinate at the same time.

10:53.880 --> 10:56.920
I'm 52. I don't think
I ever knew that. Yeah.

10:56.920 --> 11:00.800
Never crops up, though, does it?
It does when I'm speed dating.

11:00.800 --> 11:05.360
That's how I met my husband.
Anyway... What they have now

11:05.360 --> 11:07.960
is they have, like,
a training potty on the ground

11:07.960 --> 11:10.600
which has got a camera in it to
teach you how to position yourself.

11:10.600 --> 11:13.640
And so what they have is
a vacuum-cleaner-like contraption

11:13.640 --> 11:18.320
to suck away the urine and then a
hole with a bag for the faeces, OK?

11:18.320 --> 11:21.040
But how...?
Surely just a cork would do.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.480
A cork would certainly sort it out.
But there was a problem.

11:23.480 --> 11:25.560
It was a really big problem
in the early days.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.120
They used to have to put some
germ-killing liquid in the bags,

11:28.120 --> 11:31.080
the bag with the faeces,
and then they had to knead it

11:31.080 --> 11:33.880
for a few minutes.
They themselves? Yes.

11:33.880 --> 11:36.480
So it could be stabilised
and then it was stowed away

11:36.480 --> 11:39.280
for re-entry. Re-entry?!

11:39.280 --> 11:41.600
LAUGHTER

11:42.960 --> 11:47.080
Wow! Surely they could
just put it in the bin?

11:48.520 --> 11:52.920
So, when the toilet container
is full of sealed poo bags,

11:52.920 --> 11:55.040
it jettisons them into space

11:55.040 --> 11:57.680
and they eventually burn up
in the Earth's atmosphere

11:57.680 --> 12:00.080
and become shooting stars.

12:00.080 --> 12:03.840
Oh. That's not going to be quite
as romantic now we see... No.

12:03.840 --> 12:06.640
"Oh, look, you know that,
I reckon that was Neil Armstrong

12:06.640 --> 12:10.040
"having a shit, that one."
Anyway, moving on.

12:10.040 --> 12:14.360
Now, what's the best way to survive
in the Sahara? Oh.

12:14.360 --> 12:17.080
JO: Are we allowed to ask you about
this? Yes, go on, then.

12:17.080 --> 12:19.360
Cos I reckon you know quite a lot

12:19.360 --> 12:21.360
about the Sahara cos you're SANDI.

12:21.360 --> 12:22.920
Hey-hey!

12:22.920 --> 12:26.360
Heeeey! Thank you.

12:26.360 --> 12:29.560
Thank God that was a joke cos I
thought your geography was terrible.

12:29.560 --> 12:30.920
I thought you were going to go,

12:30.920 --> 12:33.120
"You know about the Sahara
cos you're Danish."

12:34.360 --> 12:36.240
What was the question?

12:36.240 --> 12:39.520
What's the best way
to survive in the Sahara?

12:39.520 --> 12:42.320
Wear a hat. Yeah.
I know how to get water.

12:42.320 --> 12:46.360
You can get a bit of plastic
with four sticks in the corners

12:46.360 --> 12:48.080
so it dips in the middle,

12:48.080 --> 12:50.200
and you put a cup under it... Mm-hm.

12:50.200 --> 12:55.120
..and then the condensation at night
will get under, on the underside,

12:55.120 --> 12:57.480
and will all run to the middle
and drop in the cup.

12:57.480 --> 13:01.560
AUSTRALIAN ACCENT: That's a tip
from the outback in Australia that
I learned when I was in Australia.

13:01.560 --> 13:03.480
AUSTRALIAN ACCENT:

13:01.560 --> 13:03.480
You're absolutely right.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.520
NORMAL ACCENT: But what if
you've got some water?

13:05.520 --> 13:07.920
Should you make it last for a long
time or drink it all?

13:07.920 --> 13:09.680
What should you do?
Sip it slowly. No. No.

13:09.680 --> 13:12.120
I know that.
I meant gulp it all down in one.

13:12.120 --> 13:15.280
In fact, only have half of it
and throw the other half away.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.440
LAUGHTER

13:17.440 --> 13:20.720
Lots and lots of hikers who have
been found in a poor condition

13:20.720 --> 13:23.120
have been found with plenty of water
in their bottles.

13:23.120 --> 13:27.040
If you're thirsty, you should drink.
The water is better inside you
than it is inside the bottle.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.880
And you should use relatively
large gulps, to be honest,

13:29.880 --> 13:32.520
cos if you use small sips,
the body does not recognise

13:32.520 --> 13:34.840
that it has been rehydrated
and you stay thirsty.

13:34.840 --> 13:37.440
But the first thing...
And you should, by the way,

13:37.440 --> 13:38.920
once you've emptied your bottle,

13:38.920 --> 13:41.760
fill it up with your urine
and drink it. No. No? Yes.

13:41.760 --> 13:45.240
You shouldn't do that? No. Bear
Grylls does that. Absolutely not.

13:45.240 --> 13:47.520
No matter what Bear Grylls says,
drinking urine

13:47.520 --> 13:49.160
will only further dehydrate you.

13:49.160 --> 13:52.760
Why might that be? Because it's very
salty. Unbelievably salty.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.840
It has a salt content of about 2%,
depending on the person. Oh, Bear.

13:55.840 --> 13:59.360
That's not much lower than
seawater, which is 3.5%.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.920
And kidneys will waste water trying
to remove the salt from the body

14:02.920 --> 14:04.120
for a second time.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.640
So one of the other things is
what you said about wearing a hat,

14:06.640 --> 14:10.160
save sweat, not water, so you can
reduce the amount of water

14:10.160 --> 14:11.880
you're losing by finding shade.

14:11.880 --> 14:15.560
Don't eat too much because your body
will waste water digesting it

14:15.560 --> 14:17.560
and even keeping out of the wind,

14:17.560 --> 14:20.320
because air can speed up
sweat evaporation.

14:20.320 --> 14:23.520
What about taking water out of a
cactus? What do we think about that?

14:23.520 --> 14:26.240
I'd say that's a good idea.

14:23.520 --> 14:26.240
LAUGHTER

14:26.240 --> 14:29.760
So you're in the Sahara... Yeah.
Yeah, you'd struggle to find one.

14:29.760 --> 14:32.520
Oh, you're still in the Sahara?
I'm still in the Sahara.

14:32.520 --> 14:35.160
You didn't say that. Oh, in that
case, if you're in the Sahara,

14:35.160 --> 14:37.840
I'll tell you what, I wouldn't even
bother, there isn't any.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.240
There is only one naturally
occurring species of cactus

14:40.240 --> 14:43.280
outside America, the mistletoe
cactus, which grows in forests,

14:43.280 --> 14:45.920
and anything that looks like a
cactus is a member

14:45.920 --> 14:49.160
of the Euphorbia family, and
they are mostly highly toxin.

14:49.160 --> 14:52.640
What do you think kills more people
than thirst in the desert?

14:52.640 --> 14:55.880
I bet it's hypothermia.
No, it's not hypothermia.

14:55.880 --> 14:59.480
It's counterintuitive
is what it is. Chapped lips.

14:59.480 --> 15:03.080
What would be the very, very, very
extreme opposite of dehydration?

15:03.080 --> 15:05.000
Drowning. Drowning is exactly right.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.560
Drowning? Drowning in the desert?
Drowning is exactly right.

15:07.560 --> 15:10.200
People neglect the threat
of flash floods.

15:10.200 --> 15:13.880
So dry channels, ditches,
what are sometimes called wadi,

15:13.880 --> 15:16.360
they can fill with water
really quickly.

15:16.360 --> 15:18.960
And it's fantastically strong
and very, very violent.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.520
And it can suddenly create
a wall 10 to 30 feet high.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.240
More people will die of drowning
than they will die of thirst.

15:24.240 --> 15:27.600
I tell you what, God has got a good
sense of humour. It's a laugh.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.400
Days and days of looking for water,

15:29.400 --> 15:31.400
you find it, and then you drown.
Yeah.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.960
Don't go to the desert
without a life jacket.

15:33.960 --> 15:37.960
I just love the idea of Alan walking
around in a life jacket, going,

15:37.960 --> 15:40.880
"You'll see. You'll see."

15:40.880 --> 15:43.720
I was filming in the Sudan,
and we were in a wadi,

15:43.720 --> 15:47.520
which is an empty dry riverbed,
and it was a perfectly nice day,

15:47.520 --> 15:51.320
and suddenly water came rushing,
we never even saw it com...

15:51.320 --> 15:53.600
It was terrifying, absolutely
terrifying,

15:53.600 --> 15:55.200
and we just got up the bank,

15:55.200 --> 15:57.840
and by the time I was standing on
the bank, there was a full river

15:57.840 --> 16:00.360
flooding down below us. Sandi,
you are only a little person -

16:00.360 --> 16:02.080
was it a puddle? Yeah.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.760
GROANING AND LAUGHTER

16:02.080 --> 16:04.760
That's fair. That's fair.

16:04.760 --> 16:07.280
To me, the whole of life is
a massive adventure.

16:09.320 --> 16:11.320
Speaking of a lack of water,

16:11.320 --> 16:14.560
what Olympic sport could you do
in an empty swimming pool?

16:14.560 --> 16:18.960
So are we looking for a sport that
roughly takes place in that size?

16:18.960 --> 16:22.080
Well, it's a sport that developed
from empty swimming pools.

16:22.080 --> 16:25.880
Skateboarding. Yes!
What about comedy diving?

16:25.880 --> 16:28.720
You'd only have the event
the one time, I think.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.600
Like that TV show "Splash!"

16:30.600 --> 16:33.320
that you did, but it'd be called
"Thud!"

16:33.320 --> 16:36.200
I was just going to say
synchronised swimming,

16:36.200 --> 16:39.080
cos then it's just dancing, innit?
That would just be nice.

16:39.080 --> 16:40.720
Just dancing in a floral bonnet.

16:40.720 --> 16:43.840
There was a drought in California
in the late 1970s and it meant

16:43.840 --> 16:46.560
there were a lot of pools that were
left empty and it coincided

16:46.560 --> 16:49.480
with the rise of skateboarding
and it helped develop the concept,

16:49.480 --> 16:52.640
first of all, of something
called bowl skating. And then...

16:52.640 --> 16:54.120
Not a pool like that, though.

16:54.120 --> 16:56.760
They're called kidney-shaped pools.
Yeah. Yeah.

16:56.760 --> 17:00.120
In fact, sometimes they would
sneak in and drain them,

17:00.120 --> 17:02.400
if people were away. Really?
Just to have a go?

17:02.400 --> 17:05.280
And then go and use them
till the cops showed up.

17:05.280 --> 17:08.200
There's a rather good film called
something Dog something,

17:08.200 --> 17:10.000
I can't remember. Anyway...

17:10.000 --> 17:11.920
Skateboard films, google that.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.640
Lords Of Dogtown. Yeah, that's it.

17:13.640 --> 17:16.600
I used to skateboard, you know.
Back in the day. Did you?

17:16.600 --> 17:19.880
Yes, I loved it.
Had Kryptonic wheels.

17:19.880 --> 17:24.320
Is that good? Red. 65mm. There
are people at home going, "Oh!"

17:24.320 --> 17:30.680
When you see, like, the sort of '90s
grunge music videos from California,

17:30.680 --> 17:33.920
they're often skateboarding
around... Doing the stuff. Yeah.

17:33.920 --> 17:37.200
Alan's quite pleased
that you associate his skateboarding
with the '90s!

17:37.200 --> 17:39.680
It was a long time before that!

17:39.680 --> 17:41.960
They're all skateboarding round

17:41.960 --> 17:44.760
and Alan's there going,
"I'll pick you up at five, love."

17:44.760 --> 17:48.040
LAUGHTER

17:48.040 --> 17:50.280
Anyway, it took a while
for everybody to get used to it.

17:50.280 --> 17:54.040
Norway banned skateboarding
completely, 1978-1989.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.640
Said it was too dangerous.

17:55.640 --> 17:58.200
But actually, apparently,
it has many benefits.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.880
Cities with skate parks do
actually have lower rates

18:00.880 --> 18:03.120
of crime and antisocial behaviour.

18:03.120 --> 18:05.440
Is that cos they've all got
broken legs?

18:05.440 --> 18:07.920
Yeah, they can't walk.
They can't go anywhere.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.640
But apparently it's a great way
to exercise, particularly...

18:10.640 --> 18:13.320
I don't get it. It's brilliant fun.
Anyway, some tricks.

18:13.320 --> 18:16.480
Let's see if anybody can tell me
what they entail.

18:16.480 --> 18:18.120
A stiffy.

18:18.120 --> 18:21.040
That's when you skateboard
with an erection.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.720
LAUGHTER

18:23.720 --> 18:26.320
And it's very important not to fall.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.960
Is a stiffy when you go along
those metal railings

18:29.960 --> 18:32.880
cos they're stiff? No. So you jump
off the top of the ramp,

18:32.880 --> 18:34.720
you keep
both your feet on the board,

18:34.720 --> 18:38.560
and then you straighten your legs
and hold your board with your hand.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.720
OK, how about a hippy jump?
Oh, well, that's easy.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.160
You just get a fella with long hair

18:42.160 --> 18:44.560
to lie down and try and jump him
like a double-decker bus.

18:44.560 --> 18:46.920
A little bit. Is it a bit like that?
A little bit.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.520
Basically, you jump off your board,
so over an obstacle,

18:49.520 --> 18:52.320
it keeps rolling
and then you land back on it.

18:52.320 --> 18:55.840
Oh, I've seen these. Have you? Yeah.
Salad grind.

18:55.840 --> 18:58.920
That's just a lunch break
from it all, isn't it?

18:58.920 --> 19:01.600
So the back wheels slide
across the top of a ramp

19:01.600 --> 19:04.760
while the front is raised upwards.
It's named after the inventor, a man

19:04.760 --> 19:07.720
called Ed Dressen, who was known
to his friends as "Salad" Dressen.

19:07.720 --> 19:10.680
Oh, clever. Oh, now you've explained
it, I can't believe I didn't get it.

19:10.680 --> 19:14.280
Yeah. The opposite of
a salad grind is a willy grind,

19:14.280 --> 19:17.280
where the front slides on the ramp
and the back is depressed.

19:17.280 --> 19:19.880
And your cock goes along
the edge of the ramp.

19:19.880 --> 19:24.480
It's named after a Filipino boarder
called Willy Santos.

19:24.480 --> 19:29.080
This one's very unpleasant.
This is called a sack tap.

19:29.080 --> 19:33.240
I know what a back, crack and sack
is. Have you ever had one?

19:33.240 --> 19:36.080
No. I've often thought about it.
Why have you thought about it?

19:36.080 --> 19:39.480
Are you particularly hairy?
No, but I'd like to be smooth.

19:39.480 --> 19:41.760
LAUGHTER

19:44.640 --> 19:46.360
Wow. Just for once, you know.

19:46.360 --> 19:49.640
Do you know what the correct term is
for hairy buttocks? I do not.

19:49.640 --> 19:53.400
Dasypygal.
Wasn't she a judge on Strictly?

19:53.400 --> 19:55.680
Sack tap. Well, a sack,

19:55.680 --> 19:58.760
it'll be something about
you go so low down... Yeah.

19:58.760 --> 20:00.960
..that you're tapping your sack
on the board.

20:00.960 --> 20:05.280
Oh, you'd, like, teabag the floor.
Teabagging the floor to put it

20:05.280 --> 20:07.480
in more youthful terminology.

20:07.480 --> 20:10.280
So the skater has jumped off
the top of the ramp, OK,

20:10.280 --> 20:11.880
they grab the board with both hands

20:11.880 --> 20:15.520
and then they tap the scrotum with
the board and then put the board

20:15.520 --> 20:17.960
back under the feet.
Who thought that was a thing?

20:17.960 --> 20:20.640
Tapping your scrotum
with a skateboard?

20:20.640 --> 20:22.520
Let's have a look at this picture.

20:22.520 --> 20:23.880
Be awful if you started,

20:23.880 --> 20:27.760
and you didn't even have
to lift the board up! Lee!

20:29.520 --> 20:31.400
That's horrible.

20:31.400 --> 20:35.000
That's called a Christ Air, where
you grab the board in one hand,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.960
and you stretch out the body
in a cross position, like that.

20:37.960 --> 20:39.080
Wow. I know.

20:39.080 --> 20:42.560
What is so solid about
the siksik squirrel?

20:42.560 --> 20:45.200
What are you calling him,
the squirrel? Siksik. Siksik?

20:45.200 --> 20:47.760
Also known as the
Arctic ground squirrel.

20:47.760 --> 20:50.680
Siksik. He's called siksik
because that's the sound he makes.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.920
It's onomatopoeic.
Oh. Very strong teeth.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.880
No. This is... You know, every now
and then we do a creature on here

20:56.880 --> 20:59.320
that I go,
"Oh, isn't the world amazing?!"

20:59.320 --> 21:04.040
So it hibernates for eight months
of the year, during which time

21:04.040 --> 21:07.760
it freezes solid -
the whole squirrel, OK? What?!

21:07.760 --> 21:12.160
It can supercool its blood
to minus three degrees centigrade.

21:12.160 --> 21:14.640
So that's colder than any other
mammal can survive.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.360
Humans die if our temperature
fluctuates even by a few degrees

21:17.360 --> 21:19.400
either side of 37.5.

21:19.400 --> 21:22.320
So a liquid needs something
for its molecules to grab on to

21:22.320 --> 21:24.040
before it can form ice crystals.

21:24.040 --> 21:28.320
And to avoid this, all imperfections
are removed from a siksik's blood

21:28.320 --> 21:32.240
and we do not know how they do this.
Whoa.

21:32.240 --> 21:34.480
But here's the really unfortunate
side-effect.

21:34.480 --> 21:37.280
They hide away, so you can... I can
imagine what the side-effect is -

21:37.280 --> 21:40.360
people finding them. If you picked
one up, darling, and you shook it,

21:40.360 --> 21:42.640
it would freeze and die. Oh!

21:42.640 --> 21:45.680
So its heartbeat slows down
to just twice a minute.

21:45.680 --> 21:49.040
So that's the same pace as a... Blue
whale. A blue whale, exactly right.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.600
Every three weeks,
it comes out of hibernation

21:51.600 --> 21:53.080
because it has to go to sleep,

21:53.080 --> 21:55.160
because, even though
it's been frozen,

21:55.160 --> 21:58.680
the brain still needs sleep
from time to time.

21:58.680 --> 22:00.320
Well, my true story.

22:00.320 --> 22:03.840
We used to have a tortoise, and
there was an overnight snowstorm,

22:03.840 --> 22:06.720
and I found my mum in the garden,
I was just about to go to school,

22:06.720 --> 22:10.120
and my mum was digging
in her nightie, with a shovel...

22:10.120 --> 22:12.280
I thought she'd buried Dad again!
But no.

22:12.280 --> 22:13.760
I went, "What's up?" And she went,

22:13.760 --> 22:16.400
"The tortoise was out all night
and now it's under the snow."

22:16.400 --> 22:19.040
She was looking for it.
And then she finally found it -

22:19.040 --> 22:21.800
its head and legs were out
and it was absolutely solid,

22:21.800 --> 22:24.920
so obviously we assumed it was dead.
My mum being my mum,

22:24.920 --> 22:27.120
instead of just contacting the vet,

22:27.120 --> 22:30.840
she put it under the warm tap,
just held it under.

22:30.840 --> 22:32.960
I said, "I'm sure you're not
supposed to do that,"

22:32.960 --> 22:35.120
and then put it
in front of a three-bar fire.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.520
Just set it there.

22:36.520 --> 22:38.880
And even tried to teaspoon brandy
in its mouth.

22:39.920 --> 22:42.600
Aww! I swear to God,
it came back alive.

22:44.280 --> 22:45.760
Singing!

22:45.760 --> 22:48.080
# Oh, Danny boy... #

22:50.520 --> 22:52.200
Saying, "Do you want some?!"

22:54.440 --> 22:56.240
"Who's going to the garage?"

22:58.760 --> 23:01.800
"Give us another warm bath, love,
that were lovely."

23:03.480 --> 23:05.440
What was it called? Brutus.

23:05.440 --> 23:07.160
Brutus? Yes. Perfect name.

23:07.160 --> 23:10.120
Yeah, Brutus, and it lived for many
more years after that.

23:10.120 --> 23:13.440
God knows what effect it had had on
its brain, but it seemed all right.

23:13.440 --> 23:16.120
Well, the brain is the bit that's
really interesting because

23:16.120 --> 23:18.640
the day it comes back from having
been completely frozen,

23:18.640 --> 23:20.800
it suffers from a form of amnesia,

23:20.800 --> 23:23.880
and the brain resembles those
of human dementia patients,

23:23.880 --> 23:26.680
from which it recovers
really quickly.

23:26.680 --> 23:29.720
And I love this because scientists
are trying to work out again

23:29.720 --> 23:33.160
what is the process cos you might be
able to help human sufferers. Whoa.

23:33.160 --> 23:35.000
And also, before they go into
hibernation,

23:35.000 --> 23:37.120
this is a bit like your brandy with
your tortoise,

23:37.120 --> 23:40.600
they gorge themselves on magic
mushrooms, and nobody's sure

23:40.600 --> 23:44.760
if it's for some psychedelic benefit
or because...just nutrients.

23:44.760 --> 23:46.280
Sounds like they have a great time.

23:46.280 --> 23:48.440
It's not a bad life, is it?
They have a great life.

23:48.440 --> 23:49.680
Eight months a year.

23:49.680 --> 23:52.560
Imagine that, and their little book
is just open at the page.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.280
And they wake up and go...

23:56.800 --> 23:59.560
Now, for a question on syc-ophants.

23:59.560 --> 24:03.160
What's the worst result
of excess arse kissing?

24:04.520 --> 24:07.520
A promotion you didn't want,
surely.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.160
I think that's probably true.

24:09.160 --> 24:12.480
I like this picture. Somebody has
actually kissed his arse.

24:12.480 --> 24:15.120
Are there not lipstick marks
on his right buttock?

24:15.120 --> 24:18.480
Oh, yeah. OK, the worst result of
excess arse kissing,

24:18.480 --> 24:21.320
we are going back to the Romans.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.840
Emperor Caligula got sick, 37AD,

24:23.840 --> 24:26.240
and everybody wanted to show how
upset they were.

24:26.240 --> 24:28.920
There's Nero on the left
and Caligula on the right there.

24:28.920 --> 24:32.640
Anyway, there was one particularly
sycophantic plebeian

24:32.640 --> 24:35.000
called Publius Afranius Potitus,

24:35.000 --> 24:39.320
and he publicly announced that he
was willing to give up his own life

24:39.320 --> 24:42.480
if it meant that Caligula would get
better.

24:42.480 --> 24:46.520
The Emperor did recover, and
he forced Potitus to keep his word,

24:46.520 --> 24:49.640
and when he didn't kill himself,
Caligula had him executed.

24:49.640 --> 24:52.840
Oh, my God!
Wow, that's a bit harsh.

24:52.840 --> 24:55.920
But Nero, on the left, he hired
professional sycophants.

24:55.920 --> 24:59.920
He would enter a singing competition
and pay people to applaud

24:59.920 --> 25:03.360
so that it looked, you know, as
realistic as possible when he won.

25:03.360 --> 25:06.760
He would have groups of 5,000
soldiers called Augustals,

25:06.760 --> 25:09.400
who would cheer him while he was
singing.

25:09.400 --> 25:12.840
There was a French poet in the
16th century called Jean Daurat,

25:12.840 --> 25:16.080
and he read about the Augustals,
these guys that Nero paid

25:16.080 --> 25:18.800
to cheer him on, and so he bought
a number of tickets

25:18.800 --> 25:21.040
for a performance
of one of his plays,

25:21.040 --> 25:23.680
and he gave them to people who
promised to applaud and to cheer,

25:23.680 --> 25:25.640
and they became known as claqueurs.

25:25.640 --> 25:28.600
Oh, yes, that's what a claque is,
isn't it? Yeah.

25:28.600 --> 25:32.240
So that's arse kissing, but who gave
us the insult "kiss my arse"?

25:32.240 --> 25:33.760
Mother Teresa?

25:37.680 --> 25:41.560
There was a Teutonic mercenary
called Gotz von Berlichingen,

25:41.560 --> 25:44.480
and he was known in Germany
as one of the bravest soldiers

25:44.480 --> 25:47.840
in history, said to have
used the insult as a response

25:47.840 --> 25:51.640
to the Swabian army when they
besieged his home town in 1516,

25:51.640 --> 25:54.240
and the act is immortalised in
a play by Goethe,

25:54.240 --> 25:57.080
as leck mich am Arsch,
lick me in the arse,

25:57.080 --> 25:59.680
it's now known as the Swabian
Salute.

25:59.680 --> 26:01.560
Lick me in the arse?
Lick me in the arse.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.800
It does work, doesn't it?
If you are facing up to someone

26:03.800 --> 26:06.200
and they go, "Kiss my arse,"
it gets you more aggressive.

26:06.200 --> 26:09.000
If someone says, "Lick my arse,"
you go, "You all right, mate?"

26:09.000 --> 26:10.360
You'd back off.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.240
You'd walk away, you'd go, "I'm not
messing with him, he's mental."

26:13.240 --> 26:15.880
Why's he got such a tiny arm?
I'll tell you why.

26:15.880 --> 26:17.680
He can't tap his own sack, can he?!

26:17.680 --> 26:21.000
No, but he is very famous
in the history of prosthetics.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.320
So, a decade before inventing kiss
my arse,

26:23.320 --> 26:26.640
he lost his arm to cannon fire, and
he had some very impressive

26:26.640 --> 26:28.920
iron prosthetics made, so, at the
time,

26:28.920 --> 26:30.560
there was only a simple hook usually

26:30.560 --> 26:33.200
for somebody who had a prosthetic
for gripping things,

26:33.200 --> 26:34.800
and he had one with finger joints

26:34.800 --> 26:37.040
that allowed him to still brandish
his sword.

26:37.040 --> 26:40.320
He carried on being a mercenary
until he was 60, and this is the
exact arm.

26:40.320 --> 26:42.200
It's now on display in Heilbronn.

26:42.200 --> 26:45.200
Does anybody know where the Pogues
got their name from?

26:45.200 --> 26:47.920
Yes, pogue mahone,
and that means kiss my arse.

26:47.920 --> 26:51.240
MAISIE: Does it really? Oh!
I like that.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.920
So that's your arse kissing,
and for the rest of the show

26:53.920 --> 26:56.240
I'll be awarding bonus points for
sycophancy.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.560
But don't go too far
or I'll have you executed.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.280
How can laxatives help the lovesick?

27:02.280 --> 27:04.120
VOMITING

27:05.240 --> 27:08.160
I don't know the answer, I just
wanted to say you're looking lovely.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.760
An extra point for Lee.
Thank you.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.960
SCATTERED APPLAUSE

27:14.720 --> 27:17.160
I think you're heading to a good win
today.

27:17.160 --> 27:19.040
Thank you.

27:17.160 --> 27:19.040
VOMITING

27:19.040 --> 27:20.480
Yes? I don't care about winning,

27:20.480 --> 27:22.440
just being here and looking at you
is enough.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.320
Have him killed!

27:27.320 --> 27:29.480
Yes! Damn!

27:29.480 --> 27:32.800
What is it, how can laxatives...?
How can laxatives help the lovesick?

27:33.880 --> 27:35.840
RETCHING, GURGLING

27:35.840 --> 27:39.560
Probably just give you a bit of
perspective, I imagine, you know?

27:39.560 --> 27:43.880
Like, if you're worried about
soiling yourself, you've got bigger

27:43.880 --> 27:47.640
fish to fry, you've got a bigger
problem at hand, I would imagine.

27:47.640 --> 27:50.360
It's a very good point. Do we think
lovesickness is a real thing?

27:50.360 --> 27:53.560
No! Yeah. Yeah. Oh! I think it can
have physical effects.

27:53.560 --> 27:54.840
Yeah, absolutely does.

27:54.840 --> 27:57.160
Loss of appetite, depression,
inability to sleep.

27:57.160 --> 28:01.680
Weirdly, historically, also supposed
to have resulted in excess blinking.

28:01.680 --> 28:04.480
You can literally die of a broken
heart, that is a thing.

28:04.480 --> 28:07.000
Is that a real thing?
I've heard people say it, but...

28:07.000 --> 28:10.080
So, if you have severe emotional
stress, it can weaken

28:10.080 --> 28:13.040
the left ventricle, that's the
heart's main pumping chamber,

28:13.040 --> 28:16.520
and it gives you a condition
called takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

28:16.520 --> 28:19.160
I have to say, more than 90%
of the cases are reported

28:19.160 --> 28:21.240
in women aged 58 to 75.

28:21.240 --> 28:24.200
I mean, most people recover.
There's a very low death rate.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.760
But there's never
been a case in Yorkshire.

28:29.160 --> 28:32.120
NORTHERN ACCENT: "Oh, well, I'll
just buy a whippet instead."

28:37.520 --> 28:39.880
I mean, today we blame it on an
imbalance of hormones,

28:39.880 --> 28:42.520
although historically they used
to blame it on the four humours.

28:42.520 --> 28:44.880
Anybody know what the four humours
were?

28:44.880 --> 28:46.600
Frankincense and myrrh.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.840
It's phlegm and blood
and black bile...

28:48.840 --> 28:52.520
Blood's one, yes, bile. Two kinds,
black bile and yellow bile.

28:52.520 --> 28:56.640
But their medical science was based
on the humours for centuries.

28:56.640 --> 29:00.120
And lovesickness was supposedly
down to an excess of black bile,

29:00.120 --> 29:03.360
and so the best cure was thought
to be laxatives

29:03.360 --> 29:05.240
right up until the Victorian times.

29:05.240 --> 29:09.600
No! Yes. So if that didn't work,
then purgatives to make you vomit

29:09.600 --> 29:14.120
or leeches to drain your blood,
that was the way to cure people.

29:14.120 --> 29:18.160
Actually, the worst story, in the
fifth century there was a Roman

29:18.160 --> 29:20.920
collection of biographies called the
Historia Augusta, and

29:20.920 --> 29:25.040
Marcus Aurelius's wife Faustina,
she had terrible lovesickness

29:25.040 --> 29:26.640
for a hunky gladiator,

29:26.640 --> 29:29.960
and it was cured by having the
gladiator killed,

29:29.960 --> 29:33.480
and she and Marcus Aurelius had sex
in a pool of his blood.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.040
Oh, my... No! No!

29:35.040 --> 29:38.680
He was always seen as the sort of
good Emperor, Marcus Aurelius.

29:38.680 --> 29:43.080
Yes. All of history is full of
stories trying to undermine

29:43.080 --> 29:45.640
powerful women
with fanciful sexual stories.

29:45.640 --> 29:48.320
I mean, it is depressingly common
throughout history.

29:48.320 --> 29:52.040
So, probably we should take
this story with a handful of salt.

29:52.040 --> 29:55.160
The best cure for love sickness
is sex,

29:55.160 --> 29:58.680
but what happens to your body
if you engage

29:58.680 --> 30:00.720
in too much spelunking?

30:00.720 --> 30:04.040
Spelunking... Is it one
of your skateboard moves?

30:04.040 --> 30:08.080
Oh! No. I like that, though.
We've done a quick spelunk.

30:08.080 --> 30:12.400
So the Latin "spelunca" is cave.

30:12.400 --> 30:15.240
So it's the hobby
of exploring caves - spelunking.

30:15.240 --> 30:19.760
Oh! Ah. So, in 1989,
they did an experiment.

30:19.760 --> 30:22.880
They took a 27-year-old Italian
interior designer called

30:22.880 --> 30:25.960
Stefania Follini and it was an
experiment about circadian rhythm,

30:25.960 --> 30:28.400
so about the way in which your body
normally functions.

30:28.400 --> 30:31.120
And she lived in isolation
in a cave in New Mexico.

30:31.120 --> 30:34.200
This is the actual cave
where she lived. She had a guitar,

30:34.200 --> 30:36.640
she had computers not attached
to the internet.

30:36.640 --> 30:38.880
She found two mice in the cave,

30:38.880 --> 30:41.760
which she named
Giuseppe and Nicoletta,

30:41.760 --> 30:43.560
and they became
her sort of companions.

30:43.560 --> 30:47.640
I thought you said she found a mouse
called Giuseppi and Nicol ate her.

30:47.640 --> 30:51.880
Don't know who Nicol is
but it's her only friend,
she could have left him alone.

30:51.880 --> 30:55.680
She lost weight. She had very low
vitamin D. Her periods stopped.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.520
Her body clock changed completely.

30:57.520 --> 31:00.760
She would stay awake for 20 hours
and then sleep for 10. Oh.

31:00.760 --> 31:03.440
And when she came out
after 130 days,

31:03.440 --> 31:07.880
she guessed she'd been there
for 60 days. Whoa! Did she have...

31:07.880 --> 31:09.240
She had the lighting, right?

31:09.240 --> 31:11.880
She had that lighting, but she
didn't have any natural light...

31:11.880 --> 31:13.840
She had no form of time-telling.
..whatsoever.

31:13.840 --> 31:16.960
And when she came out, it was really
way, way too bright for her.

31:16.960 --> 31:21.000
She had to have dark glasses
and so on. There she is, coming out.

31:21.000 --> 31:24.840
Oh, yeah. Looks all right. Looks all
right, but that's her going in.
Yeah.

31:24.840 --> 31:26.600
LAUGHTER

31:26.600 --> 31:28.360
How long do you think you would last

31:28.360 --> 31:31.600
in a plain room
with no stimulation whatsoever?

31:31.600 --> 31:35.120
What did she do? She...
She was an interior designer.

31:35.120 --> 31:39.520
LAUGHTER

31:35.120 --> 31:39.520
How long did she last?

31:39.520 --> 31:41.120
Well, she was there a very long
time,

31:41.120 --> 31:44.080
but I'm talking about a completely
plain room with no stimulation.

31:44.080 --> 31:47.240
So you saw her room, she had a
guitar and she made friends with the
mice,

31:47.240 --> 31:50.120
and she had a computer and stuff,
she had books. What if you'd had

31:50.120 --> 31:51.880
nothing? Just a cube of white.

31:51.880 --> 31:54.240
I mean, a month is going to be hard,
innit?

31:54.240 --> 31:56.480
It's going to be a small amount of
time, isn't it?

31:56.480 --> 31:59.720
I'm going to say three days and
you're cracking up. Really?

31:59.720 --> 32:02.480
That short? Yeah, it's really
a very short period of time.

32:02.480 --> 32:07.080
So the CIA were researching supposed
Chinese brainwashing techniques

32:07.080 --> 32:11.120
in the 1950s, there was a Canadian
psychologist called Donald O Hebb,

32:11.120 --> 32:14.880
and he performed an experiment,
so the participants got $20 a day

32:14.880 --> 32:18.440
to sit in a cell with everything
that might stimulate them removed.

32:18.440 --> 32:21.360
They wore cotton gloves, they had
cardboard cuffs,

32:21.360 --> 32:24.320
soft goggles to prevent the eyes,
even, rusting,

32:24.320 --> 32:27.280
and nobody could last seven days,
you couldn't last a week.

32:27.280 --> 32:31.080
And in the corner was a $23 million
toilet. Yeah.

32:31.080 --> 32:33.840
And all of them reported
hallucinations. Really?

32:33.840 --> 32:37.080
Yeah, so to begin with, it's just
sort of dots and geometric patterns.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.560
Some of them are great.

32:38.560 --> 32:41.200
One person saw parade of squirrels
with backpacks

32:41.200 --> 32:43.280
marching along a snowy field,

32:43.280 --> 32:46.600
another saw a bathtub being steered
by an old man in a metal helmet.

32:46.600 --> 32:48.680
But none of them could last seven
days?

32:48.680 --> 32:52.840
No, they were too depressed to have
no stimulation whatsoever.

32:52.840 --> 32:56.480
Caves - we go back to spelunking -
can obviously cause claustrophobia,

32:56.480 --> 32:57.960
but I just wanted to show you this

32:57.960 --> 33:00.560
cos it's one of my bucket list
things I want to do.

33:00.560 --> 33:05.120
It's the Sarawak Chamber in Borneo.
It is... Look at that. Wow, yeah.

33:05.120 --> 33:08.880
There's some caves in Vietnam that
are enormous, amazing places.

33:08.880 --> 33:11.320
And in some places
in northern Vietnam,

33:11.320 --> 33:13.280
they are still discovering them.

33:13.280 --> 33:16.760
So you'll go down a hole, some of
them only appear when the water

33:16.760 --> 33:19.120
goes down and you go through
a hole and...

33:19.120 --> 33:21.360
So people are still looking
for caves.

33:21.360 --> 33:24.440
That's the nice bit of caving,
though, isn't it? You have a stroll.

33:24.440 --> 33:27.800
That bit's fine, it's having to get
through a tiny little hole

33:27.800 --> 33:29.800
where there's loads of water
down there.

33:29.800 --> 33:32.560
That's what people are doing, they
are going into all those holes,

33:32.560 --> 33:34.760
in the belief that eventually
they'll come out

33:34.760 --> 33:35.960
into something like that.

33:35.960 --> 33:38.200
But what you get in there is not
claustrophobia,

33:38.200 --> 33:39.880
because obviously
it's a large space.

33:39.880 --> 33:42.080
You get agoraphobia, which is...

33:42.080 --> 33:44.680
A lot of people call it
a fear of open spaces

33:44.680 --> 33:47.040
but, basically, it's a situation
where you feel

33:47.040 --> 33:51.600
there may be no escape from it.
Isn't it ag-raphobia? It... Yes.

33:51.600 --> 33:54.440
It's not called agoraphobia...
OK, so the Elves and I had

33:54.440 --> 33:55.960
had a long discussion about this...

33:55.960 --> 33:58.120
Isn't the Agora the name
of the public square?

33:58.120 --> 34:01.160
Is that where it comes? Yes.
It is to do with wide open spaces.

34:01.160 --> 34:04.480
And I said ag-raphobia and they
assured me it was agoraphobia.

34:04.480 --> 34:07.320
They're wrong. But everybody says
"ag-raphobia". Everyone says...

34:07.320 --> 34:09.480
It's the same word
with different pronunciations.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.200
Listen to them backtracking
in your ear.

34:11.200 --> 34:12.840
"It's the same word,
it's the same word!

34:12.840 --> 34:15.280
"It's a different pronunciation!"
You've got it wrong!"

34:15.280 --> 34:19.120
You Elves... El-ves, I call you.

34:19.120 --> 34:21.400
LAUGHTER

34:21.400 --> 34:24.960
People in that cave might be
suffering from megalophobia,

34:24.960 --> 34:28.840
which is a fear of huge structures.
Me-gail-o-phobia.

34:28.840 --> 34:33.840
You could fit ten Wembley stadia
inside there.

34:33.840 --> 34:37.360
Stadiums!

34:33.840 --> 34:37.360
LAUGHTER

34:38.840 --> 34:42.160
We just say Wembleys. You don't need
a plural of Wembley Stadium, do you?

34:42.160 --> 34:45.280
There's only ever going to be one.
Unless you need to fit ten of them.

34:45.280 --> 34:48.360
They must be Wembley Stadiums
because they can only ever be

34:48.360 --> 34:51.720
one Wembley Stadium. OK.
Thank you. Goodnight.

34:51.720 --> 34:53.880
LAUGHTER

34:53.880 --> 34:57.840
It's a shame, cos you really were
looking as though you were going
to win and now I don't know.

34:59.440 --> 35:02.280
I never win on this show.
Do you WANT to win?

35:02.280 --> 35:06.240
More than you could possibly
imagine, Jo. I always come last, Jo.

35:06.240 --> 35:09.720
OK. And with that, it's time
for a round of killer questions,

35:09.720 --> 35:13.040
the plague on all your houses
that we call General Ignorance.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.560
Fingers on buzzers, please.

35:14.560 --> 35:18.040
Which of these soaps
will clean me up best?

35:18.040 --> 35:22.240
Oh. Oh, yes, Lee.
Gotta be the antibacterial.

35:22.240 --> 35:25.360
KLAXON

35:25.360 --> 35:29.120
It's got to be.
Are the Elves wrong again?

35:29.120 --> 35:31.440
LAUGHTER, KLAXON

35:31.440 --> 35:35.520
Oh, no, sorry, sorry,
no, no, no, no, no.

35:36.560 --> 35:41.200
Is it the antibac-terial?
Did I pronounce it wrong?

35:42.600 --> 35:45.120
Maisie. Normal.
You're absolutely right.

35:45.120 --> 35:48.400
There is no clear evidence that
antibacterial soap is any better.

35:48.400 --> 35:49.800
May even be worse.

35:49.800 --> 35:53.440
So soap works by dissolving fats,
which helps dislodge the dirt...

35:53.440 --> 35:56.600
What?!

35:53.440 --> 35:56.600
LAUGHTER

35:56.600 --> 36:00.160
Do you think if you'd just showered
more? No-one told me that!

36:01.280 --> 36:02.960
I eat three bars a day.

36:02.960 --> 36:06.800
You've not been overeating,
you've been under-washing. Yes!

36:06.800 --> 36:09.120
LAUGHTER

36:09.120 --> 36:12.080
A lot of those beauty bars,
the ones that smell really nice,

36:12.080 --> 36:15.400
are technically not soap at all.
They're cheese.

36:15.400 --> 36:18.720
Just lathering yourself up
with Brie. Philadelphia.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.360
Are they toad vomit?

36:20.360 --> 36:25.120
"Oh, God, I've left the toad
in the chimney again!"

36:25.120 --> 36:28.720
They're technically synthetic
detergents and not soap at all.

36:28.720 --> 36:32.120
Soap has to consist of alkali salts,
of fatty acids.

36:32.120 --> 36:36.280
How can you tell
that your toe is not broken?

36:36.280 --> 36:37.840
You can wiggle it.

36:37.840 --> 36:40.600
KLAXON

36:37.840 --> 36:40.600
Oh.

36:43.720 --> 36:47.440
I forget with this show to say it
in your head first. Yeah.

36:47.440 --> 36:52.120
Edit. Yeah. So it is an old maxim
if you can move it, it's not broken.

36:52.120 --> 36:54.320
It's not only unsympathetic,
it's untrue.

36:54.320 --> 36:57.800
I mean, the toe is the least
of that person's worries. Yeah.

36:57.800 --> 37:00.800
You've managed to find
the only picture of somebody

37:00.800 --> 37:02.520
who hasn't broken their toe.

37:02.520 --> 37:06.120
The poor person is going to wake up
and they've just got somebody going,

37:06.120 --> 37:09.560
"Great news is -
wiggle them toes!"

37:09.560 --> 37:12.520
I think the best clue
is if you hear a loud snap,

37:12.520 --> 37:15.120
that's usually...
That's the best clue.

37:15.120 --> 37:18.160
Do you remember a goalkeeper from
Manchester City

37:18.160 --> 37:19.680
called Bert Trautmann?

37:19.680 --> 37:22.360
Yes, he broke his neck
in the Cup Final.

37:22.360 --> 37:24.120
He did, and carried on playing.

37:24.120 --> 37:26.080
Terry Butcher did that as well.
Really?

37:26.080 --> 37:28.600
I said to him, I was doing a radio
show, and we had him on

37:28.600 --> 37:31.080
for an interview, and I used to like
to ask the guests,

37:31.080 --> 37:33.160
"What's the worst injury
you've ever had?"

37:33.160 --> 37:34.960
And he said, "Broken neck."

37:34.960 --> 37:37.040
Wow. And I said, "Did you go off?"

37:37.040 --> 37:38.720
And he said no.

37:38.720 --> 37:41.360
MAISIE GASPS
Carried on heading. That's insane!

37:41.360 --> 37:44.720
Well, Bert Trautmann collided with
Birmingham City forward Peter Murphy

37:44.720 --> 37:46.760
during the 1956 FA Cup Final.

37:46.760 --> 37:49.560
Is that the moment it happened?
Or is that a different...?

37:49.560 --> 37:51.560
I think that is the moment.

37:51.560 --> 37:54.360
Have a look at this picture of
Bert Trautmann. Look at that.

37:54.360 --> 37:57.120
Wow. Those are fantastic photos.
Yeah.

37:57.120 --> 38:00.120
Is a broken bone stronger
afterwards?

38:00.120 --> 38:02.200
I'm going to say...

38:02.200 --> 38:03.640
VOMITING

38:03.640 --> 38:04.880
Maybe.

38:06.960 --> 38:09.040
I'm going to say yes and no.

38:09.040 --> 38:12.160
Yes.

38:09.040 --> 38:12.160
LAUGHTER

38:12.160 --> 38:14.800
VOMITING
I'm going to say I agree with Jo.

38:14.800 --> 38:18.600
There is some truth to this because
extra-tough bone will form

38:18.600 --> 38:21.880
around a fracture to protect the
healing bits, but it's temporary.

38:21.880 --> 38:23.640
I broke my leg when I was a kid,

38:23.640 --> 38:27.320
and when I got older,
I trained for the marathon,

38:27.320 --> 38:30.160
and I only got about halfway in the
training and then the doctor said,

38:30.160 --> 38:33.400
"Your problem is that one leg is
much shorter than the other leg,

38:33.400 --> 38:36.760
"so you're putting more pressure on
one leg when you're running."

38:36.760 --> 38:38.240
And you're going round in circles.

38:38.240 --> 38:40.640
I used to always run
right next to the kerb

38:40.640 --> 38:42.320
and even it out, it was fine.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.720
And he said, "It will be connected
to the fact you broke your leg
as a kid."

38:45.720 --> 38:48.640
And I still want to know, has
the healing made it longer

38:48.640 --> 38:50.160
or has the healing made it shorter?

38:50.160 --> 38:52.560
Cos I can't remember which leg was
the longest, you see.

38:52.560 --> 38:55.000
I mean, if it worked, I'd break both
my legs...

38:56.760 --> 38:58.080
And then ten years later,

38:58.080 --> 39:00.480
find out it's the opposite,
it makes you smaller.

39:02.840 --> 39:06.960
How does eating food help you
get less drunk? It lines... Hmm.

39:06.960 --> 39:11.640
Oh! Go on, Maisie!
Go on, Maisie! Come on!

39:11.640 --> 39:15.080
Maisie was going to say
line your stomach. No!

39:15.080 --> 39:17.200
KLAXON

39:15.080 --> 39:17.200
That's for you.

39:17.200 --> 39:19.160
That's not me, that's for you.

39:19.160 --> 39:22.080
What's Kate Middleton doing
in the kitchen?

39:22.080 --> 39:23.400
If you were there you'd go,

39:23.400 --> 39:26.200
"You need to take a look
at yourself, love."

39:26.200 --> 39:28.760
Yeah. She looks like...
Eating a pizza, swigging...

39:28.760 --> 39:31.360
Come on, Lee,
that's your dream girl.

39:31.360 --> 39:34.400
Anyway, here's the thing.
When you drink alcohol,

39:34.400 --> 39:37.040
it can enter your bloodstream one
of two ways - either through

39:37.040 --> 39:38.760
your stomach or your small
intestine.

39:38.760 --> 39:41.320
The intestine obviously has a much
larger surface area,

39:41.320 --> 39:43.560
so it absorbs alcohol
much more quickly.

39:43.560 --> 39:45.880
And which of these is going
to end up doing the job

39:45.880 --> 39:47.880
depends on what you have eaten.

39:47.880 --> 39:50.800
So if you are full,
the sphincter between your stomach

39:50.800 --> 39:54.400
and your small intestine is closed,
and more of the work will be done

39:54.400 --> 39:57.600
by your stomach, so a fatty meal

39:57.600 --> 40:01.040
can reduce your peak alcohol
concentration by 50%.

40:01.040 --> 40:03.960
Never mind all that,
we ordered olives - where are they?

40:05.600 --> 40:07.200
So what's the right thing to eat?

40:07.200 --> 40:10.320
You want to have something... It
doesn't actually line your stomach,

40:10.320 --> 40:11.840
it just keeps your stomach very busy

40:11.840 --> 40:14.360
so that it can't get through
to the intestine. Keeps it busy.

40:14.360 --> 40:17.280
It's the same reason, darling,
that low-sugar mixers, you know,

40:17.280 --> 40:19.560
like slimline tonics,
you get drunk faster...

40:19.560 --> 40:21.960
I've never had a slimline tonic
in my life.

40:21.960 --> 40:23.600
Never been so insulted!

40:25.640 --> 40:29.040
They get you drunk faster
than normal mixers. Oh. Do they?

40:29.040 --> 40:31.040
Yeah. So with a normal...
I'll try it, then.

40:31.040 --> 40:33.920
With a normal sugary mix,
there's lots of calories to burn,

40:33.920 --> 40:36.600
it keeps your stomach working
and it keeps the alcohol away

40:36.600 --> 40:38.560
from the intestines for longer.

40:38.560 --> 40:41.080
The effect can put you
over the limit on a breathalyser.

40:41.080 --> 40:43.800
That's the difference.
There's a curious thing.

40:43.800 --> 40:46.600
When you drink, the brain creates
a substance called galanin.

40:46.600 --> 40:50.040
It has a role in addictions. If you
inject it into mice,

40:50.040 --> 40:51.480
the thing they want to do is to eat

40:51.480 --> 40:53.840
really fatty foods
and drink alcohol.

40:53.840 --> 40:56.040
MAISIE GASPS

40:53.840 --> 40:56.040
Aww!

40:56.040 --> 40:58.720
And do they get emotional and
tell you about their ex-boyfriend?

40:58.720 --> 41:00.320
The more alcohol and fatty foods...

41:00.320 --> 41:02.120
Then walk home carrying their shoes.

41:02.120 --> 41:05.520
The more alcohol and fatty food they
have, the more galanin they produce,

41:05.520 --> 41:08.120
and the more fatty food
and alcohol they crave. Aww.

41:08.120 --> 41:10.360
Eating might help you slow
how drunk you get,

41:10.360 --> 41:12.560
but it doesn't do it by soaking up
the booze.

41:12.560 --> 41:16.160
Helen of Troy had a face
that launched how many ships?

41:16.160 --> 41:20.240
Careful, Maisie. Oh, Maisie,
what is it? Come on, Maisie.

41:20.240 --> 41:23.080
I can't remember the number now.
Help me out here, Maisie.

41:23.080 --> 41:26.000
Oh, shall I do it? Maisie,
I'll do it. A thousand.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.760
KLAXON

41:26.000 --> 41:29.760
Yay!

41:29.760 --> 41:32.520
But, at the time, there weren't
a thousand ships in the world.

41:32.520 --> 41:35.560
There weren't enough shipbuilders.
Yeah, something like that.

41:35.560 --> 41:39.680
There weren't any oceans.
There were no such thing as...
No-one had sailed anywhere.

41:39.680 --> 41:41.440
LAUGHTER

41:41.440 --> 41:43.520
No? None of those?

41:43.520 --> 41:46.360
People rowed.
They didn't launch ships.

41:46.360 --> 41:50.040
They didn't have a slip thing. They
didn't have the champagne bottle.

41:50.040 --> 41:53.560
They would...they would take
the ship out a bit at a time.

41:53.560 --> 41:56.400
She didn't have a face.
She was faceless!

41:57.800 --> 42:00.880
Totally smooth and faceless
like an AI robot.

42:00.880 --> 42:03.720
The face that launched a thousand
ships, it dates back to

42:03.720 --> 42:07.000
a 1592 play, Doctor Faustus
by Christopher Marlowe,

42:07.000 --> 42:08.680
and it's a rounding down.

42:08.680 --> 42:13.040
Homer's Iliad specifically says
there were 1,186 ships

42:13.040 --> 42:16.040
in the Greek fleet that sailed
to Troy for the Trojan War.

42:16.040 --> 42:18.600
Actually, there's lots of
misconceptions about the Iliad.

42:18.600 --> 42:20.840
It makes no mention
of a wooden horse whatsoever.

42:20.840 --> 42:23.640
That's actually referred to
in The Odyssey, which is the sequel,

42:23.640 --> 42:25.440
and then only in sort of
flashback form.

42:25.440 --> 42:28.200
And, of course, Helen of Troy was
actually Helen of...

42:28.200 --> 42:29.880
Birmingham.

42:29.880 --> 42:32.080
LAUGHTER

42:32.080 --> 42:34.840
Sparta.
She was actually Helen of Sparta.

42:34.840 --> 42:37.880
That's why I won't read The Iliad.
There's too many misconceptions.

42:37.880 --> 42:41.400
Yes, there's too much stuff.
It's like The Crown. Yeah. Yeah.

42:41.400 --> 42:44.240
There were 1,186 ships
in Homer's Iliad

42:44.240 --> 42:47.640
and anyone who says it's 1,000
is almost 20% out.

42:47.640 --> 42:51.200
Which brings us to the exact
science of the scores.

42:51.200 --> 42:53.800
Come on, not last. I'll take it.
I'll be happy.

42:53.800 --> 42:59.000
Losing the game and their lunch
in last place, with minus 27...

42:59.000 --> 43:00.520
..it's Maisie. Oh.

43:00.520 --> 43:02.000
APPLAUSE

43:02.000 --> 43:06.360
Feeling green around the gills in
third place, with minus 15 is Jo!

43:06.360 --> 43:08.080
APPLAUSE

43:08.080 --> 43:11.400
On the road to recovery in second
place, with minus three, it's Alan.

43:11.400 --> 43:14.680
APPLAUSE

43:14.680 --> 43:18.160
And in first place...
Has that fuckwit won?

43:18.160 --> 43:21.240
LAUGHTER

43:21.240 --> 43:23.920
The eighth chunder of the world...

43:23.920 --> 43:27.560
I don't think me and you
as the Chuckle Brothers would work.

43:27.560 --> 43:32.560
..with no points whatsoever...
I'll take it. It's Lee! Yay!

43:32.560 --> 43:34.920
APPLAUSE

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Thanks to Maisie, Lee, Jo and Alan

43:42.000 --> 43:44.760
and I leave you with this sickly
sign-off from the late, great

43:44.760 --> 43:48.640
Ken Dodd - I just read a book
about Stockholm syndrome.

43:48.640 --> 43:53.400
It started off badly, but by the
end, I really liked it. Goodnight.

43:53.400 --> 43:56.440
APPLAUSE
