00:52.969 --> 00:54.971
CURRENT TIME: 9:15 P.M.

00:55.764 --> 00:59.809
<i>I remembered</i> <i>we met</i>
<i>during the Namyeong Station accident.</i>

01:01.061 --> 01:02.395
<i>Do you want to meet now?</i>

01:03.104 --> 01:04.773
<i>I'll wait at Namyeong Station.</i>

01:09.611 --> 01:11.988
<i>She said, "Don't leave."</i>

01:14.157 --> 01:15.241
I'm scared.

01:16.367 --> 01:17.452
Don't leave.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.540
<i>I've disappeared.</i>

01:24.209 --> 01:25.585
<i>Is this a dream?</i>

01:27.629 --> 01:29.422
<i>Is this the world I live in?</i>

01:29.547 --> 01:32.175
SEOUL STATION

01:32.300 --> 01:36.930
<i>Am I falling into time somewhere?</i>

01:37.931 --> 01:39.015
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:40.725 --> 01:41.851
<i>It's strange.</i>

01:42.560 --> 01:43.895
<i>All I can think of is that...</i>

01:45.647 --> 01:50.151
<i>she said to me, "Don't leave."</i>

02:17.303 --> 02:19.931
<i>The number</i>
<i>you have dialed is turned off...</i>

02:32.110 --> 02:37.198
11:15 P.M.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.508
Did something happen to him?

03:02.807 --> 03:04.017
My legs hurt.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.954
<i>Tonight, on the railway of Subway Line One</i>
<i>at Namyeong Station,</i>

03:25.038 --> 03:28.875
<i>an unidentified man was found unconscious.</i>

03:29.250 --> 03:32.086
<i>The subway service was stopped</i>
<i>for 30 minutes,</i>

03:32.170 --> 03:33.713
<i>causing delays for passengers.</i>

03:34.464 --> 03:35.506
<i>This is the next news.</i>

03:36.382 --> 03:37.884
<i>Due to increasing household debt,</i>

03:37.967 --> 03:42.055
<i>next year's consumption growth rate</i>
<i>must be lowered by 0.63 percent points,</i>

03:42.138 --> 03:44.599
<i>according to</i>
<i>the Korean Economy Research Center.</i>

03:45.350 --> 03:48.269
<i>The Korean Economy Research Center</i>
<i>presented the results through</i>

03:48.353 --> 03:50.813
<i>the impact of household debt.</i>

03:50.897 --> 03:51.981
-Hello?
<i>-It said that</i>

03:52.065 --> 03:54.776
<i>the household debt positively</i>
<i>affected consumption growth.</i>

03:54.859 --> 03:55.777
The hospital?

04:13.711 --> 04:14.837
What happened?

04:15.922 --> 04:17.006
Are you okay?

04:20.677 --> 04:21.928
I asked if you're okay.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.013
What did the doctor say?

04:25.056 --> 04:26.432
Did they say you could leave?

04:31.104 --> 04:34.440
What's that look?
Why are you looking at me like that?

04:38.403 --> 04:39.946
I'm wondering if this is a dream.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.369
Maybe I should have gotten hurt.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.497
What did you say?

04:50.540 --> 04:52.375
You look like you worried about me.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.919
But nothing's wrong with me.

04:55.586 --> 04:56.546
How should I put it?

04:57.297 --> 04:59.716
It's almost as if
I've done something wrong.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.803
Is this hospital making prank calls,
or what?

05:03.886 --> 05:05.138
You look fine.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.932
Why did it sound
like something was really wrong?

05:09.183 --> 05:10.018
Here.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.981
Thank you so much,
but I don't think it's right.

05:15.523 --> 05:17.191
I'll be going, since you're fine.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.402
Didn't you come
because you were worried?

05:20.194 --> 05:22.530
You look very pale.

05:23.531 --> 05:24.741
You must've been scared.

05:27.368 --> 05:30.163
Nothing happened and you're okay.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.332
So, let's just go our own way.

05:32.623 --> 05:36.085
You asked to meet at Namyeong Station.
I just saw the text.

05:39.088 --> 05:40.298
You sure read it quickly.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.384
You said you remember who I am.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.057
We did survive death together.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.392
Aren't you being too cold?

05:53.936 --> 05:54.812
Yes...

05:56.022 --> 05:57.148
I remember it all.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.778
You're the guy from the subway
seven years ago.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.950
I was surprised and happy to find you.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.745
So, I waited all day for you.

06:12.163 --> 06:14.332
Do you know what I was thinking
while I waited?

06:17.752 --> 06:19.879
I had always been curious to know

06:20.880 --> 06:23.299
if the man
that survived with me is doing well.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.053
You are living so extremely well,

06:27.595 --> 06:30.181
I thought it was a relief.
I was so thankful.

06:31.015 --> 06:33.393
I guess we did end up meeting
since we're both alive.

06:33.476 --> 06:36.145
Then I suddenly got a call
that you were in the hospital.

06:36.729 --> 06:40.441
According to the nurse,
you got hurt in the subway tunnel.

06:40.525 --> 06:41.776
I thought, "subway again?"

06:42.985 --> 06:45.196
My insides just dropped.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.907
What kind of joke is fate playing?

06:49.033 --> 06:50.326
I wondered if you were hurt.

06:52.954 --> 06:56.666
I was so relieved to know
you were healthy and living well.

06:59.377 --> 07:00.753
Then we should...

07:02.380 --> 07:03.214
live together.

07:04.298 --> 07:06.426
Of course, we should live
for a thousand years.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.510
What are you saying?

07:08.761 --> 07:10.179
Do you want to live with me?

07:10.596 --> 07:12.306
I'll live even if you tell me not to.

07:13.891 --> 07:14.934
You promised.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.353
We'll live together.

07:21.649 --> 07:22.650
What do you mean?

07:28.072 --> 07:29.031
Are you joking?

07:30.575 --> 07:31.451
Yu So-joon!

07:34.704 --> 07:35.621
I'll go now.

07:35.705 --> 07:38.416
-Let's take a taxi. I'll take you home.
-No, it's okay.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.042
You don't have your wallet.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.586
Your bag is in my car.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.338
Oh, right.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.883
You don't have money.
Take this.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.927
I can pay for it with my phone.
You don't need to...

07:50.720 --> 07:51.971
-I'll call you.
-Hey.

07:52.346 --> 07:53.306
Yu So-joon.

07:53.723 --> 07:54.724
Thanks for coming.

07:56.559 --> 07:57.435
Are you okay?

07:58.352 --> 08:00.438
-What's wrong?
-I'm hurt.

08:00.521 --> 08:02.857
-Where does it hurt?
-I was in the emergency room.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.442
Oh no! Where's your car?

08:04.525 --> 08:06.402
-I don't have my car.
-You don't?

08:10.656 --> 08:12.116
Why would I spend his money?

08:29.175 --> 08:32.053
Guys.
I'm sorry, but I'm going to head home.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.721
Ki-doong, can I borrow your card?

08:33.804 --> 08:35.389
Yeah, sure.

08:35.556 --> 08:37.433
Go home and rest.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.018
You're probably not feeling well.

08:39.185 --> 08:41.604
But you can't just leave like that.

08:41.687 --> 08:44.023
-Tell me why you passed out in the tunnel.
-Come on.

08:44.106 --> 08:46.567
Please. I just got out of the ER.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.486
-You look fine.
-Ouch! I'm in pain.

08:48.569 --> 08:50.363
I'm just so curious.

08:50.613 --> 08:53.783
Hey. He says he was drunk.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.620
I was born in the same hospital as you,

08:57.703 --> 08:59.539
and I've seen all sides of you.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.916
Still, there are two things
I haven'tt seen.

09:02.166 --> 09:05.002
You alone with a girl,
and you passed out drunk.

09:05.294 --> 09:06.754
But I saw both today.

09:07.463 --> 09:11.300
I date girls all the time,
and I've been passed out drunk plenty.

09:11.676 --> 09:14.595
-You just haven't seen it.
-I'm not that interested in your life.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.556
Still, tell me about the tunnel.

09:16.639 --> 09:18.849
I'm so curious, it'll keep me awake.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.435
I'm sure So-joon had his reasons.

09:21.519 --> 09:24.188
What are his reasons
for going into a subway tunnel?

09:24.272 --> 09:26.607
-I'm curious. Aren't you?
-No.

09:27.316 --> 09:28.776
You're weird in my eyes too.

09:28.859 --> 09:31.571
People can go inside subway tunnels
once in their lifetime.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.030
I've done it, haven't you?

09:33.114 --> 09:34.115
Does that make sense?

09:34.615 --> 09:35.575
Does that make...

09:36.242 --> 09:37.076
Hey!

09:37.159 --> 09:38.327
Hey, Yu So-joon!

09:38.411 --> 09:41.664
What have you done all your life?
You've never been in a subway tunnel?

09:41.956 --> 09:44.709
Ask anyone.
They've all been in a subway tunnel.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.252
Hurry up. Come on up.

09:49.463 --> 09:50.673
I'm upset today.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.260
Why do you two have so many secrets?

09:54.635 --> 09:56.387
What secrets?

09:57.138 --> 09:59.515
Did you think I've never had suspicions?

10:01.100 --> 10:02.977
After So-joon's parents passed away,

10:03.060 --> 10:05.896
I always thought it was strange
he suddenly became rich.

10:06.480 --> 10:07.315
Stocks?

10:08.899 --> 10:10.484
Anyone would think it strange.

10:10.568 --> 10:13.029
You're strange for accepting it
as normal.

10:13.112 --> 10:15.156
You're right. It could appear that way.

10:15.239 --> 10:16.866
Don't put on that fake act.

10:17.491 --> 10:19.160
So-joon suddenly becomes rich.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.621
You drop out of school
to work for So-joon.

10:21.912 --> 10:23.914
Hey, I'm just helping him.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.208
It looks like
you put your life on the line.

10:31.088 --> 10:34.300
Even when So-joon was a teenager
going through puberty,

10:34.550 --> 10:38.471
he didn't care at all if I went
into his room or touched his stuff.

10:39.096 --> 10:41.015
Now, he doesn't even let me
near his house.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.433
Don't ask me about it.

10:43.809 --> 10:46.812
Even if I am living off of So-joon
like you say,

10:47.480 --> 10:50.733
I don't need to take care of him
outside of the company.

10:51.442 --> 10:54.070
There's something going on with So-joon
and you know what.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.780
There is nothing.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.783
-There's nothing?
-Nothing.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.244
Fine.

11:23.474 --> 11:24.684
Why do I...

11:30.106 --> 11:31.148
You promised.

11:32.274 --> 11:33.609
We'll live together.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.904
He sure has a way of talking.

11:38.698 --> 11:42.243
Realtor needs to come with a warning.
He's a dangerous guy.

11:51.252 --> 11:52.378
<i>I'll return your bag.</i>

11:52.837 --> 11:53.838
<i>How is 1:00 p.m?</i>

11:54.588 --> 11:55.548
<i>Let's have lunch.</i>

12:20.573 --> 12:21.782
That would be rude of me.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.079
<i>You didn't happen to...</i>

12:27.955 --> 12:30.666
<i>open my bag or anything, did you?</i>

12:32.668 --> 12:34.503
<i>Return my bag tomorrow untouched.</i>

12:35.045 --> 12:37.047
<i>I'll return your wallet untouched too.</i>

13:21.342 --> 13:24.553
Nee-nar. Be careful of Realtor.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.848
Nee-nar. Be careful of Realtor.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.982
Song Ma-rin,

13:37.441 --> 13:38.776
Chiksa Girls' High School.

13:41.362 --> 13:44.907
Okay. I'm confident
that I can keep you well fed.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.704
<i>"I'll be going now, Flower."</i>

13:51.330 --> 13:52.832
You have to say that.

13:53.165 --> 13:55.417
Not Bap-soon, but Flower.

13:56.043 --> 13:57.503
<i>Do it for me.</i>

13:58.379 --> 13:59.463
Flo...

14:01.549 --> 14:02.508
Flow...

14:05.928 --> 14:06.929
Bap-soon.

14:07.304 --> 14:08.222
Yes.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.183
You pass.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.527
How can I help you?

14:23.070 --> 14:24.697
Is this a restaurant?

14:25.322 --> 14:26.991
Whose name is the reservation under?

14:27.950 --> 14:29.618
Yu So-joon.

14:29.827 --> 14:30.828
Follow me.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.978
Why are you stealing glances?
It's creepy.

15:04.069 --> 15:07.489
Why are you smiling?
I don't like it. Don't smile.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.246
What are you looking at?

15:14.622 --> 15:16.665
Stop it. What's wrong with you?

15:17.124 --> 15:20.461
I can't smile, I can't glance.
What am I supposed to do?

15:20.836 --> 15:21.754
Should I get lost?

15:22.796 --> 15:23.631
No.

15:24.757 --> 15:25.633
Sorry.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.179
What about my bag?

15:31.889 --> 15:32.765
Is it ready?

15:35.017 --> 15:37.144
And my wallet? Is it ready?

16:12.471 --> 16:14.515
How are we supposed to eat all this?

16:16.934 --> 16:18.060
Can we take them to go?

16:19.561 --> 16:21.230
You'd be a frugal housewife.

16:22.314 --> 16:26.026
But if you live with me,
you won't need to be frugal.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.405
We'll have a duty to spend.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.534
Did you say... live together?

16:34.034 --> 16:35.953
You promised to live with me.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.455
So,

16:39.039 --> 16:40.958
the living together you were referring to,

16:41.041 --> 16:43.669
you didn't just mean
both of us staying alive?

16:44.712 --> 16:48.716
You meant living together,
as in eating and sleeping together?

16:49.842 --> 16:50.676
Yes.

16:50.968 --> 16:54.513
We haven't even held hands yet,
and you want to move in together?

17:00.269 --> 17:02.813
They say pigs are fed
before they're slaughtered.

17:04.231 --> 17:06.734
Are you feeding me this
in order to catch and eat me up?

17:07.651 --> 17:09.278
That's why you gave me your wallet?

17:10.904 --> 17:14.491
I saw second-generation rich kids
being so spoiled on TV--

17:14.575 --> 17:15.743
Hold on.

17:15.826 --> 17:17.661
I'm not a second generation rich kid.

17:17.745 --> 17:19.329
Okay. Third generation, then?

17:19.413 --> 17:20.289
Forget all that.

17:20.622 --> 17:24.126
Is moving in together the only way
for a man and woman to live in one house?

17:25.085 --> 17:26.045
Song Ma-rin,

17:26.587 --> 17:28.005
are you that single-minded?

17:28.088 --> 17:30.466
I'm a woman who knows ten things
if you teach me one.

17:31.258 --> 17:32.760
I see what you're thinking.

17:35.387 --> 17:38.307
Because of our past,
I was being thoughtful.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.934
Is this what I get in return?

17:46.482 --> 17:47.775
I'm really disappointed.

17:50.194 --> 17:52.112
What kind of woman do you think I am?

17:52.905 --> 17:55.240
-A woman I want to marry.
-What?

17:55.324 --> 17:57.326
Not to date or just move in with.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.828
But a woman I want to marry.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.083
Marry?

18:07.461 --> 18:08.295
Marry?

18:08.879 --> 18:10.798
This isn't the best timing,

18:11.131 --> 18:13.884
but I'd be an evil man
to wait any longer.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.679
What do you think?

18:18.430 --> 18:20.891
We could live in one house,
intimately and lovey-dovey.

18:20.974 --> 18:21.892
Crazy punk.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.812
Just ask me to move in with you.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.151
Where are you going?

18:32.402 --> 18:34.863
Hey. Song Ma-rin!

18:36.323 --> 18:38.367
If marriage is too sudden,

18:38.450 --> 18:41.203
what about dating?
Of course, with marriage in mind.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.371
What are you saying?

18:42.704 --> 18:43.705
Wait.

18:45.082 --> 18:45.958
Don't grab me.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.085
Don't you dare touch me.

18:48.168 --> 18:49.628
This isn't the way out.

18:49.711 --> 18:50.963
It's the restroom.

18:53.006 --> 18:55.551
That's where I was headed.
I need to wash my hands.

18:55.634 --> 18:59.138
-All right, I know. Let's go for now.
-Stop! What do you know about me?

19:01.598 --> 19:03.559
What do you really know about me?

19:04.768 --> 19:07.479
Do you know anything about marriage?
Or women?

19:07.896 --> 19:09.064
Do you know me?

19:10.899 --> 19:13.861
I only asked the woman I want to marry,
to marry me.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.613
Is getting a proposal
something to get so angry about?

19:16.780 --> 19:20.242
What kind of proposal is this?
Absurd, irrational and threatening?

19:20.951 --> 19:23.620
This isn't is a proposal.
It's a bullshit ploy.

19:23.745 --> 19:25.664
I know you may be taken aback.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.041
"This woman is the one
I'm supposed to marry.

19:28.167 --> 19:31.628
I must marry this woman."
This is my clear conviction.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.547
I have a feeling.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.092
Don't try that with me.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.178
Where are you even going?

19:39.261 --> 19:40.179
Go away.

19:41.430 --> 19:44.558
I'm not going to do anything to you.
Don't get worked up.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.769
Realtor! You scoundrel.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.772
This is harassment
under the pretext of marriage.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.609
You could get in trouble. It's dangerous.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.279
Why is this place so complicated?

19:58.530 --> 20:00.741
He brought me into the thieves' den.

20:02.409 --> 20:05.037
I think we were meant to meet
and destined to be together.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.872
A shared fate, if you will.

20:07.247 --> 20:08.957
A shared fate or bad karma.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.460
Seven years ago...

20:12.085 --> 20:15.672
if we hadn't met on that subway,
we wouldn't be here in this world.

20:16.506 --> 20:18.800
You saved me, and I saved you.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.762
Do you think our fate is bad karma?

20:22.804 --> 20:24.598
I think we are destined for each other.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.321
You're just playing me.

20:40.697 --> 20:43.825
I'm holding onto you,
asking you to have a meal with me.

20:46.703 --> 20:47.537
Come inside.

21:01.051 --> 21:05.347
So, you're being sincere with me?

21:08.100 --> 21:09.017
Yes.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.148
Let me ask you one thing.

21:17.859 --> 21:20.195
Do you love me?

21:25.826 --> 21:28.036
I think I will die if I don't marry you.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.958
So, give it some serious thought...

21:34.668 --> 21:35.544
Flower.

21:41.258 --> 21:42.884
Not Bap-soon, but Flower.

21:50.142 --> 21:50.976
<i>This...</i>

21:52.311 --> 21:56.189
<i>It's like a lump</i>
<i>I've had my whole life is dissolving.</i>

21:56.898 --> 21:58.608
<i>Is that why it hurts?</i>

22:04.781 --> 22:06.450
Are you not feeling well?

22:09.828 --> 22:10.662
Flower.

22:13.582 --> 22:14.499
Are you okay?

22:15.125 --> 22:15.959
Flower...

22:29.473 --> 22:31.141
DRIVER

22:32.392 --> 22:34.978
Yes, Secretary Hwang.
I'm a little busy right now.

22:44.237 --> 22:47.366
Chairman Yu is with Bap-soon? Why?

22:47.783 --> 22:50.619
They're coming out together
and leaving. Yes.

22:52.329 --> 22:54.289
They're definitely
in a relationship.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.666
He has his arm
on Bap-soon's shoulder.

22:57.084 --> 23:00.212
What? Her shoulder?
What about her shoulder?

23:00.295 --> 23:03.382
He has it around her shoulder
and is holding her close.

23:03.715 --> 23:07.052
Bap-soon is pushing him away.
Yes, now he's chasing after her.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.763
Yes, he is.
Anyone can see that this is love.

23:09.846 --> 23:11.890
It's passionate love.

23:12.057 --> 23:14.935
Oh, my. Yes, good job.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.565
Miss, are you okay?

23:21.358 --> 23:22.192
What?

23:22.943 --> 23:23.777
Yes.

23:44.047 --> 23:45.132
<i>Flower...</i>

23:46.758 --> 23:47.717
<i>Flower...</i>

23:48.927 --> 23:49.803
<i>Flower...</i>

23:51.346 --> 23:52.222
<i>Flower...</i>

23:53.014 --> 23:54.474
<i>Flower...</i>

23:55.767 --> 23:57.394
<i>-Flower...</i>
-No!

23:58.645 --> 24:00.230
<i>-Flower...</i>
-Stop!

24:02.149 --> 24:03.692
So, you can't ignore her?

24:04.192 --> 24:06.570
Once she found out
we were survivors of the accident,

24:06.736 --> 24:08.405
do you know what she said to me?

24:09.573 --> 24:12.576
She said she's so thankful
that I am alive. She's so relieved.

24:13.952 --> 24:15.787
How can I ignore a woman like that?

24:16.288 --> 24:18.039
I know exactly what's going to happen.

24:18.623 --> 24:21.877
So, you feel guilty to leave her to die.

24:22.461 --> 24:23.962
Gosh,

24:24.337 --> 24:26.089
you talk so distastefully..

24:26.173 --> 24:27.257
Be honest about it.

24:27.382 --> 24:30.594
You believed me when I told you
to have a child.

24:30.927 --> 24:34.306
Your heart started to beat faster,
and you wanted to do it.

24:34.389 --> 24:37.184
-You want to marry and have kids.
-You're so childish.

24:39.186 --> 24:41.021
What's there to hide between us?

24:42.022 --> 24:45.442
How much do you think I trust you,
in percentage?

24:45.942 --> 24:46.902
About 120 percent?

24:47.527 --> 24:50.864
At the most, being optimistic...

24:51.823 --> 24:52.949
about two percent?

24:53.033 --> 24:54.618
And the reason for the 98 percent?

24:54.701 --> 24:57.746
I told you that I just can't ignore her.

24:57.829 --> 25:00.707
Yeah, it's natural to feel that heat.

25:01.625 --> 25:04.127
We came to winter
because you wanted cold noodles.

25:04.211 --> 25:06.046
You're making me feel hot.

25:06.129 --> 25:08.840
Cold noodles are the best in winter.

25:10.300 --> 25:14.387
This is something only we know,
but what else is there to time travel?

25:14.721 --> 25:16.681
It's about finding
the best places to eat

25:17.015 --> 25:18.517
and traveling to them.

25:19.226 --> 25:20.352
That's the best part.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.395
Yeah.

25:25.982 --> 25:28.276
-Is it hard to chew?
-There's too much wasabi.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.404
-This place is known for noodles.
-By the way,

25:32.656 --> 25:36.201
If you really get married,
the future will completely change.

25:37.118 --> 25:40.080
A woman who wasn't in your fate
has suddenly come into your life.

25:40.872 --> 25:43.625
A reset. You should expect a reset.

25:45.544 --> 25:46.461
I suppose so.

25:48.922 --> 25:50.465
Is that such a big deal?

25:51.800 --> 25:53.218
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR KIM YONG-JIN

25:53.760 --> 25:54.886
This is Secretary Hwang.

25:55.720 --> 25:56.763
What is it?

25:58.223 --> 26:00.725
This is difficult for me to bring up.

26:01.601 --> 26:06.648
Madam is asking me to do
too many personal chores for her.

26:07.190 --> 26:08.149
-Is that right?
-Yes.

26:08.733 --> 26:11.653
But, aren't they things
that are okay to do?

26:11.736 --> 26:15.282
Well, I can do them if I want to.

26:15.448 --> 26:19.369
I would like to help her out.
It's just that it's affecting my work.

26:19.452 --> 26:21.663
Is she curious
about Bap-soon and Chairman Yu?

26:22.289 --> 26:24.040
She wants you
to look into them?

26:24.499 --> 26:27.002
She told me to keep it a secret from you.

26:27.752 --> 26:30.046
It's so obvious. You need to grow up.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.048
Chairman Yu might be a weirdo,

26:32.132 --> 26:34.968
but would he date Bap-soon?

26:35.051 --> 26:36.177
Think about it.

26:36.636 --> 26:38.430
No, they really are dating.

26:38.513 --> 26:39.931
It wasn't a casual meeting.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.270
It must be a fling,
like young people do.

26:45.395 --> 26:46.521
They're all like that.

26:48.398 --> 26:50.900
Don't just stand there.
You're making me nervous.

26:52.569 --> 26:54.738
We'll change the plan
with the Sobeol district.

26:54.821 --> 26:56.948
Isn't LE Group transferring
their headquarters?

26:57.073 --> 26:59.868
The merge fails,
so the transfer won't happen.

26:59.951 --> 27:01.828
Check the article with your own eyes.

27:01.911 --> 27:03.246
Year, 2019.

27:06.916 --> 27:08.460
It's amazing every time I see it.

27:08.543 --> 27:09.377
I know.

27:10.253 --> 27:11.796
I've been curious for a while.

27:12.255 --> 27:14.799
Why aren't you bringing anything
after March 2019?

27:15.550 --> 27:17.761
Isn't it better for us
to look further ahead?

27:22.223 --> 27:25.644
It's just tiring.
It's so far to go there.

27:26.478 --> 27:27.479
Sorry to interrupt.

27:29.105 --> 27:30.607
-Leave it.
-Should I come back?

27:30.690 --> 27:31.900
-No.
-No, come in.

27:32.359 --> 27:36.321
About today's management dinner,
I was thinking of doing it at my house.

27:36.613 --> 27:38.281
-I actually have plans...
-Of course!

27:38.448 --> 27:42.243
You went out of your way to invite us,
so of course,we should go.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.412
Then I will expect you there.

27:44.871 --> 27:45.997
-Yes.
-Yes.

27:46.915 --> 27:47.749
See you later.

27:47.832 --> 27:48.875
-Bye.
-Okay.

27:52.504 --> 27:55.173
Here. Drink this while you do it.

27:56.216 --> 27:58.093
Why am I even doing this?

27:58.385 --> 28:00.929
Friends are supposed to do these things
for each other.

28:01.012 --> 28:02.681
That's just how it works.

28:04.683 --> 28:08.353
People would think
we are best friends, wouldn't they?

28:08.603 --> 28:09.521
Friend.

28:10.605 --> 28:14.150
Are you dating anyone these days?

28:16.111 --> 28:18.279
No, why?

28:19.322 --> 28:21.241
You aren't? Really?

28:21.408 --> 28:22.575
What if I am?

28:25.328 --> 28:26.788
Jeez.

28:28.998 --> 28:30.375
<i>Flower, where are you?</i>

28:31.042 --> 28:32.168
<i>Should we meet tonight?</i>

28:34.713 --> 28:35.630
Well...

28:35.964 --> 28:37.173
Yes. Go on.

28:39.592 --> 28:40.802
Do you like being married?

28:41.219 --> 28:42.053
What?

28:42.137 --> 28:46.725
How did you decide to marry Yong-jin?

28:47.350 --> 28:49.644
Did someone ask you to marry him?

28:52.981 --> 28:55.108
They must be here. They're here.

28:56.317 --> 28:57.861
I'm coming.

28:57.944 --> 28:59.028
Welcome.

28:59.112 --> 29:01.156
Welcome.

29:01.239 --> 29:02.115
Welcome.

29:02.198 --> 29:05.118
Thank you for inviting us.

29:05.201 --> 29:06.244
-Hello.
-Welcome.

29:06.661 --> 29:09.914
-Hello! Hello!
-Wow. This looks great.

29:09.998 --> 29:12.542
Wow. This is a nice home.

29:13.251 --> 29:15.170
-Come on in.
-Hello.

29:15.253 --> 29:18.089
The interior looks great.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.507
Hello.

29:19.591 --> 29:22.093
I really like your taste.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.137
We have the same taste.

29:26.973 --> 29:29.684
Chairman? Please sit down.

29:29.768 --> 29:32.228
-Sit down, Chairman.
-Please sit.

29:33.062 --> 29:36.357
-Is it your first time here??
-No, I've been here before.

29:36.441 --> 29:38.193
-I fixed the sink.
-He fixed our sink.

29:38.485 --> 29:41.279
-Yes, I fixed it.
-You fixed the sink?

29:41.362 --> 29:44.324
Do we have something to drink?
That schisandra tea was good.

29:44.407 --> 29:45.700
I'll bring it out. Hold on.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.912
You said
Yong-jin's school friends were coming!

29:49.162 --> 29:50.497
I did?

29:50.997 --> 29:53.625
-I'm getting out of here.
-Why? Come here.

29:53.708 --> 29:54.626
Come on.

29:56.419 --> 29:59.923
My friend here helped me a lot today.

30:00.215 --> 30:02.425
I didn't prepare much,
but please enjoy the food.

30:02.509 --> 30:03.718
Thank you for the food.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.805
Please enjoy your night.
I'll be going now.

30:07.180 --> 30:08.681
You should stay and eat with us.

30:09.265 --> 30:10.600
Yes, you should.

30:12.185 --> 30:14.437
Oh, I don't think so.

30:14.938 --> 30:15.980
Have fun.

30:16.064 --> 30:16.940
You should join.

30:18.358 --> 30:19.526
She should join.

30:19.859 --> 30:21.027
She's leaving? Really?

30:21.194 --> 30:22.111
One moment.

30:26.241 --> 30:28.451
Why are you sitting
in the corner like that?

30:28.701 --> 30:29.911
I'm comfortable here.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.539
The food is good.

30:34.499 --> 30:37.418
Just like your name, Bap-soon.
Look how much you enjoy your rice.

30:40.713 --> 30:43.383
Don't you all think she looks familiar?

30:44.759 --> 30:47.011
I feel I've seen her somewhere.

30:47.595 --> 30:49.264
She's Bap-soon.

30:49.639 --> 30:53.434
"Give me rice," Bap-soon.
You all know, right?

30:53.518 --> 30:56.938
She still makes an appearance online
every now and then.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.064
"Tomorrow's Morning!"

30:58.273 --> 31:01.693
-You're that "Give me rice," Bap-soon.
-Yes!

31:01.776 --> 31:03.611
I really liked Bap-soon.

31:05.280 --> 31:09.033
Thanks to you, Gun-sook,
I get to see Bap-soon eat rice.

31:09.117 --> 31:10.535
It's an honor.

31:11.661 --> 31:12.829
Do you want an autograph?

31:13.580 --> 31:16.624
Yes, autograph!
Right here, please.

31:16.708 --> 31:19.961
Seeing the two of you living here,
I want to get married too.

31:20.503 --> 31:21.421
-Really?
-Yes.

31:21.504 --> 31:24.173
Did you hear that? Do you have anyone
to introduce him to?

31:26.175 --> 31:29.554
-We should get Secretary Hwang married.
-What? Me?

31:30.138 --> 31:32.974
Secretary Hwang,
What do you think of Bap-soon?

31:33.474 --> 31:36.060
I thought
you two were perfect for each other.

31:37.353 --> 31:40.231
I'm actually a pretty popular guy...

31:40.315 --> 31:42.150
-You two suit one another.
-I don't know.

31:42.233 --> 31:44.110
-You do suit each other.
-Gun-sook.

31:45.069 --> 31:46.321
Can you get me some water?

31:46.821 --> 31:47.947
Help yourself.

31:50.033 --> 31:51.117
It's over there.

31:52.493 --> 31:53.411
Eat up.

31:53.494 --> 31:56.664
-Yes. Thank you.
-Eat all you can.

31:56.831 --> 31:59.208
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

32:01.502 --> 32:03.588
What do you think, Chairman?

32:03.922 --> 32:08.217
About Secretary Hwang and my friend.
Aren't they perfect?

32:10.470 --> 32:11.346
I don't know.

32:11.471 --> 32:16.768
Why? I know the gossip online isn't good,
but she really isn't that bad.

32:17.810 --> 32:20.730
She suffers so much
because of people's preconceptions.

32:21.105 --> 32:22.690
She can't even get a job.

32:23.691 --> 32:26.486
Maybe I was being too greedy
because she's my friend.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.989
Honestly, Secretary Hwang
would be too good for her.

32:30.073 --> 32:32.325
-A little?
-A little bit.

32:36.579 --> 32:37.413
What was that?

32:47.966 --> 32:51.260
This was so expensive.
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

32:51.886 --> 32:54.347
Yes, so that you would shut up.

32:56.683 --> 32:59.435
I pitied you for being an outcast,
so I hung out, and now?

33:00.353 --> 33:02.647
Even I can't be your friend anymore.

33:07.402 --> 33:08.695
Let go.

33:08.778 --> 33:09.737
Clean it up.

33:11.322 --> 33:14.450
Should we fight like dogs?
Who has more to lose?

33:14.617 --> 33:16.160
Go ahead if you think you can.

33:17.120 --> 33:20.623
Why are you always trying so hard
to drag me down?

33:20.999 --> 33:23.751
That's the state you're in.
Who are you blaming?

33:24.127 --> 33:26.254
You should know your place.

33:26.713 --> 33:28.089
You crazy...

33:29.799 --> 33:31.551
You're ignorant, nothing but strength.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.678
You are more ignorant than I am.

33:33.761 --> 33:35.430
Don't pretend to be cultured.

33:35.513 --> 33:37.223
I know your past, you wench.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.268
Why don't you scream
so everyone can hear?

33:40.351 --> 33:41.436
Damn it.

33:42.937 --> 33:44.856
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

33:49.235 --> 33:50.486
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

33:50.570 --> 33:52.947
Keep eating. I'm fine.

33:54.115 --> 33:55.116
I think you're drunk.

33:55.199 --> 33:56.409
He had a lot to drink.

33:56.909 --> 33:58.494
So I fixed the sink...

34:00.121 --> 34:03.833
Do you think I've been your friend
without knowing you look down on me?

34:04.167 --> 34:06.961
Still, it seemed like you depended on me.
I pitied you.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.964
See, you don't even know your place.

34:10.048 --> 34:12.967
I just found you an easy person
to keep around.

34:13.843 --> 34:14.677
What?

34:15.178 --> 34:16.095
Didn't you know

34:16.971 --> 34:18.306
how easy and foolish you are?

34:19.140 --> 34:20.183
So...

34:21.225 --> 34:24.270
even if it's not me,
if someone is a little good to you,

34:24.645 --> 34:25.730
don't get delusional.

34:28.649 --> 34:29.817
Why don't you both stop?

34:46.626 --> 34:49.295
Okay. Thanks for letting me know.

34:51.005 --> 34:52.465
You think I'm an easy fool,

34:53.257 --> 34:54.300
and I hate you.

34:55.843 --> 34:57.637
Let's not deal with each other anymore.

35:03.601 --> 35:04.894
It's our problem.

35:05.686 --> 35:06.938
IPretend nothing happened.

35:07.021 --> 35:08.648
Gosh, this makes me angry.

35:08.981 --> 35:09.816
Excuse me?

35:09.899 --> 35:13.402
Stand out by poking people
where you know it hurts...

35:14.153 --> 35:17.073
I will remember you
as that kind of person.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.161
Let's see each other often.

35:26.707 --> 35:28.209
The four of us can get together.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.503
With Song Ma-rin.

35:41.848 --> 35:43.516
I was crazy.

35:43.724 --> 35:45.017
I should've known better.

35:47.061 --> 35:48.688
Look at you now. Look at you.

35:55.278 --> 35:56.571
I'm not picking up.

35:57.196 --> 35:58.865
I'm not going to!

36:00.616 --> 36:03.202
I'm dying of embarrassment,
so stop calling.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.013
Jeez.

36:26.726 --> 36:27.810
Hey, who are you?

36:28.728 --> 36:30.897
I think I've seen you here before.

36:30.980 --> 36:33.274
You're the one
who got my daughter drunk. Right?

36:33.649 --> 36:35.484
Oh, yes. Hello.

36:36.068 --> 36:37.945
Why are you following my daughter around?

36:38.196 --> 36:41.991
We are a conservative family.
Why are you here so late?

36:44.076 --> 36:45.786
I haven't introduced myself yet.

36:45.995 --> 36:49.165
My name is Yu So-joon.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.002
What's all this in English?

36:53.085 --> 36:55.213
Ceo? You're the ceo?

36:56.047 --> 36:57.882
I'm the CEO.

36:59.133 --> 37:01.135
I'd like to buy you a meal--

37:01.219 --> 37:02.261
Don't follow Ma-rin.

37:02.678 --> 37:04.138
Look at the time.

37:04.472 --> 37:07.016
CEO? What is that? How funny.

37:07.516 --> 37:10.228
I told her to date a senior manager,
at the very least.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.355
-Excuse me.
-How annoying.

37:19.403 --> 37:21.197
You're really not eating?

37:21.822 --> 37:23.491
I bought it for both of us.

37:24.575 --> 37:25.785
I'm going to sleep.

37:25.868 --> 37:27.119
My goodness.

37:27.495 --> 37:32.333
You know that guy
you came home drunk with before?

37:33.709 --> 37:35.628
-What?
-Never mind. Forget it.

37:40.174 --> 37:41.592
It's so good and chewy.

37:43.928 --> 37:44.762
Hey,

37:44.845 --> 37:47.098
what does a CEO do?

37:48.266 --> 37:50.184
It sounds very unstable.

37:51.394 --> 37:53.104
It's the chairman of a company.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.359
Don't bother me!

37:59.110 --> 38:01.821
So, the chairman?

38:05.700 --> 38:08.077
-What are you doing?
-I'm going to eat it.

38:08.160 --> 38:09.829
A ghost looks better.

38:09.912 --> 38:11.289
No! You'll gain weight.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.253
Only I can eat it.

38:19.588 --> 38:21.007
Seriously, your personality...

38:24.343 --> 38:26.804
Oh, my word. Oh dear.

38:27.346 --> 38:28.264
The entrance...

38:29.307 --> 38:30.141
Oh my.

38:31.309 --> 38:32.184
What is this place?

38:33.686 --> 38:34.603
Oh, my goodness.

38:44.697 --> 38:46.657
Oh, my goodness! The building is so high.

38:53.414 --> 38:56.167
MYREITS

39:04.383 --> 39:05.259
There.

39:06.260 --> 39:08.012
Excuse me. Here!

39:09.805 --> 39:10.806
Well...

39:12.016 --> 39:14.727
Sorry to bother you.
I have a question.

39:15.019 --> 39:18.105
Is there a company called "Myreits" here?

39:18.189 --> 39:19.482
It's right upstairs.

39:19.565 --> 39:21.984
So, it is here.

39:22.068 --> 39:25.654
I received this business card
from the CEO here.

39:25.946 --> 39:28.824
Is this Yu So-joon the CEO here?

39:28.908 --> 39:30.785
Yes, he is.
Should I contact his office?

39:30.868 --> 39:32.661
Oh, no.

39:34.121 --> 39:35.748
It's good enough to know he is.

39:37.416 --> 39:39.043
You look good in that suit.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.462
You should lengthen the sleeves.

39:56.602 --> 39:58.396
<i>I just sent you an email.</i>

39:58.771 --> 40:00.147
<i>Please read it.</i>

40:00.231 --> 40:01.107
<i>Bye.</i>

40:03.234 --> 40:05.528
I have a bad feeling about this.

40:11.575 --> 40:15.496
MAILBOX
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING

40:15.579 --> 40:17.164
<i>Thank you for everything.</i>

40:18.082 --> 40:21.752
<i>Realtor. I wanted to call you that</i>
<i>one last time.</i>

40:22.795 --> 40:26.132
<i>I just don't think we suit one another.</i>

40:28.551 --> 40:30.428
<i>I am lacking in so many ways.</i>

40:31.429 --> 40:33.139
<i>I am not enough.</i>

40:36.434 --> 40:37.726
<i>I'll keep this short.</i>

40:37.810 --> 40:40.896
"I really hope you don't get hurt.

40:40.980 --> 40:43.941
I want to remain a beautiful memory
to you.

40:44.024 --> 40:46.068
No, even that is selfish of me.

40:47.611 --> 40:49.029
I am a selfish woman.

40:49.113 --> 40:51.282
I will be like dust in your life."

40:52.783 --> 40:54.743
What is this?
Why is she going so overboard?

40:56.787 --> 40:58.372
Why is it so long?

41:00.082 --> 41:03.210
This must be like ten pages long.

41:06.297 --> 41:09.341
Is she asking to break up
or is she holding onto me?

41:12.011 --> 41:14.430
Does she expect me to read all this?

41:17.308 --> 41:21.020
Wow... Why is she acting like that?
Is she drunk?

41:21.770 --> 41:24.106
Gun-sook is really awful.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.611
I'll tell all the girls
what you went through.

41:29.612 --> 41:31.780
You shouldn't hang out with her either.

41:32.198 --> 41:33.073
Of course.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.284
We only did because of you.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.873
You're all I have, So-ri.

41:44.793 --> 41:47.880
Jeez. Realtor is really annoying too.

41:49.006 --> 41:49.924
What about him?

41:50.424 --> 41:54.512
He even asked to marry you.
Why, just to watch you suffer?

41:55.054 --> 41:58.265
He's the chairman and Gun-sook's husband
is the director. Why?

41:58.349 --> 42:02.436
-I told him to pretend he doesn't know me.
-Still, if he likes you, he should say so.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.438
Or he should've flipped the table over.

42:04.855 --> 42:05.898
Don't insult Realtor.

42:07.149 --> 42:08.317
You don't know anything.

42:08.400 --> 42:10.444
He isn't sincere to you at all.

42:11.153 --> 42:13.697
He is just having some fun.

42:14.865 --> 42:15.824
Isn't that obvious?

42:16.951 --> 42:19.328
There's no reason
Realtor would be sincere with me.

42:19.828 --> 42:21.121
Even if he was sincere,

42:21.997 --> 42:24.291
reality probably hit him
at Gun-sook's place.

42:25.292 --> 42:27.211
That I really don't suit him.

42:35.594 --> 42:38.013
Realtor, that punk, is a no.

42:39.390 --> 42:40.224
Hey,

42:40.766 --> 42:43.060
the worst kind of man in the world is

42:43.686 --> 42:45.771
a man who makes a woman feel shabby.

42:46.647 --> 42:49.316
I don't care how great he is.

42:49.400 --> 42:52.069
If he makes you feel shabby,
I will stop him.

42:52.152 --> 42:54.488
It's my problem.
It's up to me to solve it.

42:54.572 --> 42:58.367
It's the fault of the guy
who makes you feel that way.

42:58.450 --> 43:00.744
Hey, say no even if he offers.

43:01.579 --> 43:02.538
Don't meet him.

43:02.621 --> 43:05.791
I'm not going to.
I already told him I'm not.

43:07.376 --> 43:08.460
Good.

43:09.044 --> 43:10.421
My friend is smart.

43:12.172 --> 43:13.674
Still, don't insult Realtor.

43:14.216 --> 43:15.259
He's a good person.

43:16.635 --> 43:17.469
Also...

43:20.264 --> 43:23.517
He called me "Flower."

43:33.694 --> 43:35.821
<i>Why are you eating chestnuts</i>
<i>on the street?</i>

43:36.905 --> 43:39.533
<i>These are dates, not chestnuts, you idiot.</i>

43:39.950 --> 43:40.951
<i>D-- dates?</i>

43:42.703 --> 43:45.497
<i>I'm an urban man,</i>
<i>I'm not good with agriculture.</i>

43:45.873 --> 43:47.916
<i>Vegetables, fruits, and fish.</i>

43:56.717 --> 43:57.551
What?

44:00.804 --> 44:03.474
Mom, what are you doing?
You must be crazy.

44:05.100 --> 44:06.185
Where are you now?

44:07.728 --> 44:09.897
Why would you meet Yu So-joon?

44:09.980 --> 44:12.816
I'm telling you,
he suggested dinner first.

44:13.901 --> 44:17.446
When I called Yu So-joon,
he said he'd come right away.

44:17.821 --> 44:19.490
He even said, "Yes, Mother."

44:21.659 --> 44:23.661
How did you find a guy like that?

44:24.078 --> 44:25.287
Oh my.

44:25.871 --> 44:28.874
I'll meet him today
and take care of everything.

44:28.957 --> 44:31.960
You pretend not to know anything, okay?

44:32.086 --> 44:34.004
How did you even know his number?

44:34.630 --> 44:36.548
We are not in a relationship.

44:36.632 --> 44:38.592
Mom, don't do this.

44:39.176 --> 44:40.803
Don't you dare meet him.

44:40.886 --> 44:42.554
I won't speak to you again.

44:57.027 --> 44:57.903
Yu So-joon.

44:58.987 --> 44:59.947
Yu So-joon.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.284
Why are you here?

45:05.369 --> 45:07.371
My mom made a mistake, so leave.

45:07.454 --> 45:08.539
That would be rude.

45:09.915 --> 45:11.917
Why would you need to be polite to my mom?

45:12.000 --> 45:13.293
My mom was wrong about us.

45:13.377 --> 45:15.838
Still, she called me. I can't just leave.

45:17.589 --> 45:18.424
Wait.

45:19.800 --> 45:20.801
Wait.

45:22.219 --> 45:24.179
Didn't you read my email?

45:25.389 --> 45:27.099
I didn't read it yet.

45:29.727 --> 45:31.311
Anyway, this isn't right.

45:31.395 --> 45:33.939
I have an important meeting today.

45:34.273 --> 45:36.316
I'll talk to you later.

45:40.362 --> 45:42.531
I don't want to be exposed to you
even more.

46:18.776 --> 46:20.944
<i>When everyone adored me,</i>

46:21.403 --> 46:24.406
<i>I was my family's hope back then.</i>

46:25.699 --> 46:27.910
<i>However, the people who liked me </i>

46:27.993 --> 46:30.037
<i>turned on me in one quick moment.</i>

46:30.704 --> 46:32.956
<i>They said,</i>
<i>"She won't do.", We're tired of her.",</i>

46:33.123 --> 46:34.208
<i>"She's over."</i>

46:35.000 --> 46:38.712
<i>I spent my teenage years</i>
<i>facing all that rejection.</i>

46:39.713 --> 46:41.423
<i>My dad left during that time.</i>

46:41.882 --> 46:43.926
<i>I became my mom's headache.</i>

46:44.968 --> 46:48.388
<i>Like all those people</i>
<i>who once loved Bap-soon,</i>

46:49.097 --> 46:50.808
<i>the feelings you profess for me are</i>

46:51.725 --> 46:54.061
<i>like a fleeting bubble to me.</i>

46:55.187 --> 46:57.815
<i>So I'm afraid, and I have no confidence.</i>

46:58.982 --> 47:01.193
<i>It may be my fault for that.</i>

47:02.653 --> 47:04.738
<i>Unfortunately, that's just me.</i>

47:06.448 --> 47:08.575
You should leave.

47:10.327 --> 47:11.161
What?

47:11.870 --> 47:13.789
Don't leave?

47:16.166 --> 47:17.459
I said leave.

47:17.543 --> 47:19.378
It's hard to even look at you.

47:26.051 --> 47:27.261
What are we going to do?

47:28.428 --> 47:29.555
In my eyes...

47:30.639 --> 47:33.016
I see you telling me not to leave.

47:52.536 --> 47:53.662
My mom is here.

48:19.855 --> 48:21.565
<i>I'll just say hello and come out.</i>

48:21.648 --> 48:22.524
<i>Wait for me.</i>

48:24.776 --> 48:25.903
Oh, right.

48:32.200 --> 48:33.327
SENT MAIL

48:33.410 --> 48:35.370
I don't know. We'll break up next time.

48:36.330 --> 48:37.247
MAIL HAS BEEN UNSENT

48:38.790 --> 48:39.625
Let's go.

48:40.834 --> 48:41.752
You're out already?

48:42.044 --> 48:44.630
I said I was going on a date with you,
she told me to go.

48:46.423 --> 48:47.257
Date?

48:48.342 --> 48:50.302
-Let's go to my place.
-No way.

48:52.387 --> 48:53.347
Beer?

48:59.269 --> 49:00.103
Come in.

49:04.358 --> 49:05.233
Wow.

49:05.692 --> 49:06.693
You can wear these.

49:07.694 --> 49:09.571
My place is kind of messy, right?

49:09.655 --> 49:11.073
No, it's really nice.

49:11.156 --> 49:12.032
Sit here.

49:13.617 --> 49:15.786
Don't go upstairs.

49:16.536 --> 49:17.371
Why?

49:17.913 --> 49:19.915
Privacy. Sit down.

49:29.216 --> 49:30.801
Oh no. What do I do?

49:30.884 --> 49:32.511
I'm all out of beer.

49:32.594 --> 49:34.388
I don't have a single can of beer.

49:35.472 --> 49:39.476
I guess today is not a day for drinking.

49:44.147 --> 49:45.023
Oh, that scared me!

49:47.776 --> 49:50.946
Shouldn't we go
to the convenience store then?

49:51.029 --> 49:53.699
Let's just drink next time.
You're okay with juice, right?

49:55.575 --> 49:57.035
I suppose there's no choice.

49:59.871 --> 50:01.456
We could go to the store.

50:02.249 --> 50:05.002
How can I act like things are normal
while sober?

50:09.297 --> 50:10.257
What is this?

50:13.301 --> 50:14.678
Is this from the 90's?

50:17.431 --> 50:19.182
Does he like this tacky style?

50:33.280 --> 50:34.281
-Oh, my God!
-What?

50:36.366 --> 50:38.493
-What is this thing?
-This...

50:39.536 --> 50:41.246
Why are you putting on my shoes?

50:41.329 --> 50:43.623
It wrapped itself around my foot,
on its own.

50:43.707 --> 50:45.751
-What is it?
-Hey, take it off.

50:46.877 --> 50:47.961
Wait a minute.

50:48.045 --> 50:50.047
-Take it off.
-Hold on.

50:50.130 --> 50:53.800
You can't just put these on like that.

50:54.217 --> 50:56.720
I've never even wore them outside.

50:57.304 --> 50:59.306
You didn't take pictures of these,
did you?

50:59.514 --> 51:02.225
There will be trouble if you take pictures
and post them.

51:02.434 --> 51:03.643
People will come for you.

51:03.894 --> 51:05.103
There will be chaos.

51:07.105 --> 51:09.441
-I'll just leave.
-Why? Already?

51:10.484 --> 51:13.612
I wanted to see your place,
and you're only showing me half of it.

51:14.446 --> 51:16.698
And you're making me feel awkward
over some shoes.

51:16.782 --> 51:17.949
Sorry.

51:18.033 --> 51:19.826
I was wrong. Come back.

51:19.910 --> 51:20.786
No,

51:21.828 --> 51:23.038
there's no beer either.

51:23.538 --> 51:26.249
Your family will probably be home
soon anyway.

51:28.335 --> 51:29.336
I don't have a family.

51:30.545 --> 51:31.379
My parents…

51:32.964 --> 51:34.508
died in a traffic accident.

51:35.592 --> 51:37.010
So, come on in. It's okay.

51:43.308 --> 51:47.062
I lost my parents early in life,
but moved up in the world.

51:47.771 --> 51:50.273
I suppose I'm someone
people respect a lot.

51:51.733 --> 51:52.651
Then...

51:53.401 --> 51:55.695
what about being an heir to a rich family?

52:01.743 --> 52:02.702
I thought...

52:04.663 --> 52:07.666
Still, this is something.

52:09.835 --> 52:11.753
I don't have any family,

52:11.837 --> 52:13.255
so I have a very free life.

52:14.214 --> 52:17.134
There's no one to meddle in my life.

52:19.302 --> 52:20.470
Must be lonely.

52:30.188 --> 52:33.441
Having no one to depend on,
isn't it the same for you?

52:39.281 --> 52:43.034
The great Song Ma-rin,
is the size of all this too much for you?

52:43.743 --> 52:46.997
This is enough to cover for you, right?

52:51.376 --> 52:52.502
All I want is...

52:54.546 --> 52:56.965
someone who likes me the way I am.

52:58.258 --> 53:00.552
I want to be able to do something
for that person.

53:02.345 --> 53:05.515
Someone who is comfortable and fun
to be with.

53:07.142 --> 53:09.936
I don't need anything great.
That's the kind of person I like.

53:10.020 --> 53:10.979
Nothing great?

53:11.813 --> 53:14.316
You didn't expect anything great.

53:14.608 --> 53:16.067
But you did get something great.

53:21.156 --> 53:24.159
You'd be perfect
if you would stop talking about marriage.

53:26.203 --> 53:29.039
Do you not have a midpoint
with your personality?

53:29.122 --> 53:31.458
You make it
so that I can't have a midpoint.

53:34.169 --> 53:35.128
What did I do?

53:37.672 --> 53:40.425
What did I do to make you act so extreme?

53:44.596 --> 53:46.348
I'm nervous about leaving you alone.

53:47.474 --> 53:49.059
I feel like something will happen.

53:50.185 --> 53:51.394
I keep worrying.

53:53.230 --> 53:55.523
I usually don’t worry about other people.

53:56.816 --> 54:01.071
Strangely, I really want to be involved
in your life.

54:03.240 --> 54:04.532
I think that would be right.

54:06.076 --> 54:06.993
Right?

54:07.077 --> 54:07.911
Yes.

54:09.704 --> 54:14.376
Rather than being apart...
I think we should be together.

54:15.460 --> 54:17.420
I don't think we should ignore each other.

54:18.213 --> 54:21.091
We should overcome everything together.

54:22.259 --> 54:23.593
That's the right thing to do.

54:24.469 --> 54:27.639
Stay by my side.

54:28.682 --> 54:31.685
So that I can protect you.

54:36.856 --> 54:40.360
Put your future in my hands.

54:44.489 --> 54:45.407
Future...

54:48.410 --> 54:50.245
Just don't bring up marriage.

54:51.329 --> 54:52.872
That makes you seem weird.

54:55.792 --> 54:58.420
Well, if you leave out marriage...

55:00.255 --> 55:02.549
I guess I can date you once.

55:04.175 --> 55:06.344
Then are we dating now?

55:08.346 --> 55:09.347
Depends on how you do.

55:11.016 --> 55:12.600
We're really dating, right?

55:13.852 --> 55:15.186
Why are you coming so close?

55:15.270 --> 55:16.855
Huh? It's just...

55:17.439 --> 55:19.941
I want to confirm it.

55:20.025 --> 55:21.276
Are we really dating?

55:28.742 --> 55:29.576
By the way...

55:31.369 --> 55:32.620
I mean...

55:34.456 --> 55:36.291
You have really pretty hands.

55:36.916 --> 55:38.251
You have a pretty nose.

55:41.004 --> 55:42.422
-Ma-rin.
-Yes?

55:46.134 --> 55:47.010
Should we go?

55:49.179 --> 55:50.138
Okay.

55:59.272 --> 56:01.399
Can we do this?

56:02.108 --> 56:02.942
Yes.

56:04.903 --> 56:06.071
So soon?

56:07.364 --> 56:08.198
Yes.

56:37.060 --> 56:39.979
I love you this much.

56:40.063 --> 56:40.980
Me too.

56:57.497 --> 56:58.665
<i>I'm getting married.</i>

56:59.249 --> 57:00.083
What, girl!

57:02.794 --> 57:04.963
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

57:05.046 --> 57:07.424
-I'm getting married.
-Finally!

57:07.507 --> 57:08.716
Congratulations, really.

57:08.800 --> 57:11.136
She's so pretty, isn't she?

57:11.219 --> 57:12.679
Calm down, would you?

57:12.762 --> 57:14.973
The invitations came out.
You have to come.

57:16.224 --> 57:17.183
Congratulations!

57:17.267 --> 57:18.560
Congratulations!

57:21.563 --> 57:22.647
Are you that happy?

57:27.402 --> 57:31.573
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

57:44.127 --> 57:46.004
Mother, please allow me to marry Ma-rin.

57:46.463 --> 57:47.881
I will take good care of her.

57:48.131 --> 57:49.716
Mother, please.

57:52.469 --> 57:54.888
-Mother.
-What now? Oh, my.

57:55.638 --> 57:56.514
What are you doing?

58:09.110 --> 58:10.195
Are we getting married?

58:27.128 --> 58:29.881
Taking the picture now. One, two, three.

58:30.006 --> 58:31.466
That's great. Very pretty.

58:31.549 --> 58:33.718
Lower the heart a little.

58:33.801 --> 58:34.677
Just a little bit.

58:34.761 --> 58:37.138
We'll go again. One, two, three.

58:37.222 --> 58:40.016
That was great.
Can the bride smile a little bit more?

58:40.099 --> 58:44.354
Move your head a little.
That's good. Okay. One, two, three.

58:44.437 --> 58:46.064
Beautiful!

58:49.192 --> 58:51.319
One, two, three.

59:03.456 --> 59:06.042
Se-young, let's leave early today.

59:06.626 --> 59:08.628
We need to get ready
for So-joon's wedding.

59:09.254 --> 59:10.380
It's already tomorrow?

59:10.463 --> 59:12.048
Get ready to leave.

59:12.840 --> 59:15.051
How many more days
are you going to work late?

59:16.135 --> 59:18.555
So-joon's the one getting married.
Why get ready?

59:18.930 --> 59:19.847
I'm not the bride.

59:19.931 --> 59:23.935
We have to take pictures tomorrow
and so on.

59:30.942 --> 59:32.443
I'm going to the store.

59:32.777 --> 59:34.195
Do you want something to drink?

59:35.280 --> 59:36.531
Get me some cigarettes.

59:36.906 --> 59:38.658
I said drink.

59:43.580 --> 59:44.789
Jerk!

59:45.915 --> 59:47.584
He never even dated anyone.

59:50.169 --> 59:51.838
Why is he in such a hurry?

59:56.884 --> 59:58.928
SO-JOON

59:59.721 --> 1:00:00.972
I'm in a meeting.

1:00:01.180 --> 1:00:03.808
-See you at the wedding tomorrow.
-<i>Hey, Shin Se-young.</i>

1:00:06.019 --> 1:00:06.978
She can't come?

1:00:07.729 --> 1:00:09.522
Is she mad at me about something?

1:00:09.606 --> 1:00:11.941
She won't meet me. It's kind of hurtful.

1:00:12.025 --> 1:00:13.651
She's been working hard lately.

1:00:13.735 --> 1:00:16.613
-I'm getting married tomorrow.
-You know that's how Se-young is,

1:00:16.696 --> 1:00:18.615
And we don't have time for dinner.

1:00:18.698 --> 1:00:21.075
How do you plan on moving all this today?

1:00:21.159 --> 1:00:22.619
Where is your new apartment?

1:00:22.702 --> 1:00:25.288
Me? I'm moving to yours.

1:00:25.371 --> 1:00:26.205
What?

1:00:26.873 --> 1:00:28.541
I'm moving to your place.

1:00:28.791 --> 1:00:29.834
Isn't that obvious?

1:00:30.251 --> 1:00:31.336
Crazy punk...

1:00:31.419 --> 1:00:33.212
Hey, no you can't.

1:00:33.296 --> 1:00:36.215
I have my personal life too.
You didn't even ask me.

1:00:36.299 --> 1:00:39.427
The new place is too small.

1:00:41.471 --> 1:00:43.765
I just feel a bit guilty.

1:00:43.848 --> 1:00:44.724
For what?

1:00:45.183 --> 1:00:47.644
It feels like you have two homes.

1:00:49.062 --> 1:00:52.732
Are you really not going to tell Ma-rin
about the other world?

1:00:52.815 --> 1:00:55.151
She is your family now,
so shouldn't you be honest?

1:00:55.234 --> 1:00:58.321
Even if I tell her the truth,
I can't be honest about everything.

1:00:58.404 --> 1:00:59.656
What else are you hiding?

1:01:01.115 --> 1:01:02.241
Nothing.

1:01:02.325 --> 1:01:04.452
I'll tell you later.

1:01:05.953 --> 1:01:06.829
Hey.

1:01:08.581 --> 1:01:09.957
What do you think marriage is?

1:01:11.459 --> 1:01:14.045
A housemate with a lifelong contract?

1:01:14.545 --> 1:01:15.380
Gosh.

1:01:17.131 --> 1:01:18.049
I guess.

1:01:18.132 --> 1:01:21.052
I don't know why people
put so much meaning into marriage.

1:01:21.511 --> 1:01:24.806
You can just live the way you did
while respecting each other's style.

1:01:24.889 --> 1:01:27.225
You can live comfortably like that.
Don't you think?

1:01:28.726 --> 1:01:29.560
No?

1:01:30.478 --> 1:01:32.146
I'm getting married tomorrow.

1:01:35.066 --> 1:01:37.402
To that man I met on the subway.

1:01:41.155 --> 1:01:42.323
I'll live a good life.

1:01:43.866 --> 1:01:44.784
I'll do my best.

1:02:00.508 --> 1:02:01.759
It must be a shower.

1:02:11.811 --> 1:02:13.980
<i>Bride and groom, enter.</i>

1:02:50.683 --> 1:02:51.768
Pretty!

1:02:54.771 --> 1:02:56.773
Smile. Smile.

1:03:22.924 --> 1:03:25.134
Rain falls from a clear sky today.

1:03:26.135 --> 1:03:31.015
There will be many days in life
when it will rain.

1:03:32.225 --> 1:03:35.645
When it does,
these two people will join hands tightly.

1:03:36.395 --> 1:03:38.064
They will be each other's umbrellas.

1:03:38.606 --> 1:03:41.818
They have promised to protect each other
with love's umbrella.

1:03:49.617 --> 1:03:52.662
Kiss! Kiss!

1:04:01.671 --> 1:04:02.713
It's really amazing.

1:04:03.923 --> 1:04:04.841
What is?

1:04:05.800 --> 1:04:07.760
You said it seemed like
it would rain today,

1:04:08.261 --> 1:04:10.221
so we shouldn't do an outdoor wedding.

1:04:11.848 --> 1:04:14.684
You trusted the weather forecast
over my senses.

1:04:16.018 --> 1:04:17.311
That's the strange part.

1:04:17.979 --> 1:04:20.690
How are you always more precise
than the forecast?

1:04:22.358 --> 1:04:23.651
Here we go.

1:04:23.734 --> 1:04:25.862
Look here. Here.

1:04:25.987 --> 1:04:27.280
Yes, that looks good.

1:04:27.780 --> 1:04:30.199
One, two, three.

1:04:30.575 --> 1:04:31.909
That looks good.

1:04:31.993 --> 1:04:32.994
Everything's great.

1:04:33.077 --> 1:04:36.205
Now, face each other lovingly.

1:04:36.455 --> 1:04:38.749
Good. Don't move. Just like that.

1:04:38.875 --> 1:04:41.919
Okay. One, two, three.

1:04:42.003 --> 1:04:43.462
Very good.

1:04:52.305 --> 1:04:53.264
Mine...

1:04:54.557 --> 1:04:55.474
My husband.

1:04:58.144 --> 1:04:59.395
So handsome.

1:05:01.564 --> 1:05:02.481
Is he dead?

1:05:05.484 --> 1:05:06.527
He's alive.

1:05:09.405 --> 1:05:10.406
He's alive!

1:05:13.826 --> 1:05:17.622
He's my husband from here,
and he's my husband from over here.

1:05:20.499 --> 1:05:22.293
See you later, mine.

1:05:26.839 --> 1:05:29.008
Wait a minute. Where did mine go?

1:05:30.468 --> 1:05:31.719
Here he is!

1:05:33.179 --> 1:05:35.723
Hold on now. Where did mine go?

1:05:36.682 --> 1:05:37.683
Here he is!

1:05:40.269 --> 1:05:42.063
Mine, mine... where are you?

1:05:44.106 --> 1:05:45.191
Here he is!

1:06:00.665 --> 1:06:02.083
Why are you coming out? Go in.

1:06:02.166 --> 1:06:04.377
It's your first day at work
since we got married.

1:06:04.460 --> 1:06:06.379
I've always wanted to do this.

1:06:07.254 --> 1:06:09.382
What a strange thing.
I'll be going now.

1:06:12.885 --> 1:06:13.886
Honey!

1:06:17.098 --> 1:06:18.140
Have a nice day.

1:06:19.934 --> 1:06:20.851
My husband.

1:06:23.354 --> 1:06:24.647
Come home early.

1:06:29.402 --> 1:06:30.528
Go inside.

1:06:32.822 --> 1:06:35.533
<i>That man and I...</i>

1:06:36.325 --> 1:06:39.704
<i>That woman and I...</i>

1:06:39.829 --> 1:06:41.455
<i>-got married.</i>
<i>-got married.</i>

1:07:10.192 --> 1:07:12.194
