00:00.062 --> 00:03.100
<i>Air and naval
forces of the United States</i>

00:03.132 --> 00:06.034
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>
<i>against terrorist facilities...</i>

00:06.068 --> 00:08.102
<i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

00:08.137 --> 00:09.404
<i>He has sanctioned
acts of terror</i>

00:09.438 --> 00:11.773
<i>in Africa, Europe and</i>
<i>the Middle East.</i>

00:11.807 --> 00:14.776
<i>This will not stand, this
aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

00:14.810 --> 00:16.411
<i>This relentless
pursuit of terror.</i>

00:16.445 --> 00:18.079
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

00:18.113 --> 00:19.681
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

00:19.715 --> 00:20.915
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

00:20.950 --> 00:22.850
This was an act of terrorism.

00:22.885 --> 00:25.320
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:25.354 --> 00:27.789
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

00:27.823 --> 00:28.957
is one of the good old
favorites.

00:28.991 --> 00:31.426
...until something stops him.

00:31.460 --> 00:34.262
<i>It was right</i>
<i>in front of my eyes,</i>

00:34.296 --> 00:35.930
<i>and I never saw it coming.</i>

00:35.965 --> 00:39.000
<i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:39.034 --> 00:41.502
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

00:41.537 --> 00:45.440
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

00:51.380 --> 00:53.548
<i>You're the smartest</i>
<i>and the dumbest fucking person</i>

00:53.582 --> 00:55.717
<i>I've ever known.</i>

00:55.751 --> 00:57.352
<i>I'm not the
one who got it wrong.</i>

00:57.386 --> 00:59.487
<i>I'm the only one</i>
<i>who got it right.</i>

01:03.359 --> 01:05.193
<i>Take 'em.</i>

01:05.227 --> 01:06.928
<i>Take 'em all.</i>

01:14.117 --> 01:17.298
Homeland - 3x06
"Still Positive"

01:18.207 --> 01:19.674
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

01:19.708 --> 01:22.810
I'm inviting you into an
ongoing operation, Peter.

01:22.845 --> 01:24.078
Carrie's and mine.

01:24.113 --> 01:25.280
<i>You mean burning her</i>

01:25.314 --> 01:26.547
<i>in front of the Senate?</i>

01:26.582 --> 01:28.149
The case officer in question,

01:28.183 --> 01:30.151
she's been diagnosed as bipolar.

01:30.185 --> 01:32.086
<i>Committing her to
a mental institution.</i>

01:32.121 --> 01:33.855
This is a fucking sham!

01:33.889 --> 01:34.989
<i>All an act.</i>

01:35.024 --> 01:36.224
<i>Part of the plan.</i>

01:36.258 --> 01:37.625
Fuck me.

01:37.660 --> 01:39.160
Two nights ago,
the deputy chief

01:39.194 --> 01:41.763
of Iran's Intelligence
Directorate took the bait.

01:41.797 --> 01:44.332
<i>We believe</i>
<i>he's on his way here.</i>

01:44.366 --> 01:45.600
What do you mean,
Dana's missing?

01:45.634 --> 01:46.968
She disappeared three days ago.

01:47.002 --> 01:48.202
<i>She stole my car</i>

01:48.237 --> 01:50.171
<i>and broke her boyfriend</i>
<i>out of the clinic.</i>

01:50.205 --> 01:53.341
His parents put him there
to avoid a homicide charge.

01:53.375 --> 01:55.677
The one thing I cannot have
in my life is lies,

01:55.711 --> 01:57.245
- and y-you lied to me!
- Dana, please...

01:57.279 --> 01:58.980
I spoke to
the President yesterday.

01:59.014 --> 02:00.214
He's concerned.

02:00.249 --> 02:02.283
He's... exploring some changes

02:02.318 --> 02:04.118
in intelligence practice.

02:04.153 --> 02:05.887
I'll do whatever it takes.

02:05.921 --> 02:08.823
But I won't temper my views
just to get your support

02:08.857 --> 02:10.625
for my confirmation as director.

02:10.658 --> 02:13.394
I'm afraid you've got
this backwards, old friend.

02:13.429 --> 02:15.997
I'm the one getting
nominated as director.

02:20.302 --> 02:21.836
Saul.

02:21.870 --> 02:24.372
I didn't expect you
back tonight.

02:24.406 --> 02:26.841
This is Alain Bernard.

02:26.875 --> 02:27.909
Hello.

02:29.278 --> 02:31.479
Yes?

02:31.513 --> 02:33.081
I think the watch is back on.

02:34.216 --> 02:36.084
No sound.

02:36.118 --> 02:37.819
Any sign of Carrie?

02:37.853 --> 02:39.387
No, there's no sign of Carrie.

02:39.421 --> 02:41.022
I'm too fucking far away.

02:43.692 --> 02:44.892
I'm getting closer.

02:44.927 --> 02:47.195
Quinn, do not move.

02:47.229 --> 02:48.629
Quinn?

02:50.432 --> 02:52.367
Yeah, I'm inside.
She's gone.

02:52.401 --> 02:53.468
We lost her.

02:53.502 --> 02:54.802
But we know who's got her.

02:54.837 --> 02:56.437
<i>We're back in business.</i>

02:56.472 --> 02:57.972
<i>She's on her own, Saul.</i>

02:58.006 --> 02:59.774
<i>She's always been on her own.</i>

02:59.808 --> 03:02.343
Take it off.

03:05.981 --> 03:07.949
Carrie Mathison.

03:38.814 --> 03:41.749
Police traffic
cameras picked up three men

03:41.783 --> 03:44.318
leaving DC with Carrie
in a Dodge sedan

03:44.352 --> 03:46.120
around 1:34 AM.

03:46.154 --> 03:48.022
False plates.
Likely a stolen vehicle.

03:48.056 --> 03:49.890
Show him the UAV footage.

03:49.925 --> 03:51.592
Mmm.

03:51.626 --> 03:53.260
This might take a minute.

03:54.329 --> 03:56.697
- About time.
- Oh, sorry.

03:56.731 --> 03:58.866
My taxi got lost.

03:58.900 --> 04:01.235
You took a fucking taxi
to a CIA safe house?

04:01.269 --> 04:02.870
It's a joke.

04:02.904 --> 04:07.808
I flew in from a job in Georgia;
I got here as fast as I could.

04:07.843 --> 04:09.443
Hi.

04:09.477 --> 04:10.911
I'm waiting.

04:10.946 --> 04:13.881
Trying to send him
the drone feed.

04:15.383 --> 04:19.053
The car turns onto the
GW Parkway six minutes later,

04:19.087 --> 04:21.589
Beltway 14 minutes after that,

04:21.623 --> 04:25.426
then heads north on 270
towards Germantown.

04:25.460 --> 04:27.394
Pulls into a truck stop.

04:27.429 --> 04:30.064
Three men hustle Carrie inside.

04:30.098 --> 04:31.298
The drone is now useless.

04:31.333 --> 04:32.967
Truck stop security cameras?

04:33.001 --> 04:35.870
Limited to gas pumps,
cash registers and bathrooms.

04:35.904 --> 04:37.071
Nothing.

04:37.105 --> 04:38.239
What about the car?

04:38.273 --> 04:39.506
They never went back to it.

04:39.541 --> 04:41.408
It's still there
six hours later.

04:42.878 --> 04:44.578
So we lost her.

04:44.613 --> 04:45.946
Yes.

04:45.981 --> 04:47.648
How about we check
the car for prints,

04:47.682 --> 04:50.017
see if we can ID
any of those three men?

04:50.051 --> 04:52.286
No. We don't panic
or do anything

04:52.320 --> 04:53.754
that could compromise Carrie.

04:53.788 --> 04:56.090
Right.

04:56.124 --> 04:58.993
Keep looking.

05:03.298 --> 05:05.466
Fuck.

05:34.629 --> 05:37.564
Firstly, Miss Mathison,
I wish to apologize

05:37.599 --> 05:40.601
for the precautions we had
to take in bringing you here.

05:40.635 --> 05:42.836
I understand.

05:42.871 --> 05:44.238
If we are

05:44.272 --> 05:47.775
to have a relationship
that has any real meaning...

05:47.809 --> 05:51.412
we must first establish
the most important ingredient.

05:51.446 --> 05:53.213
Trust.

05:54.683 --> 05:57.318
Now...

06:01.256 --> 06:03.257
Are you ready?

06:04.292 --> 06:05.626
Yes.

06:05.660 --> 06:08.629
Is this the month of March?

06:08.663 --> 06:10.664
Yes.

06:10.699 --> 06:13.033
Are you married?

06:13.068 --> 06:14.301
No.

06:15.370 --> 06:17.171
Do you know who I am?

06:18.807 --> 06:21.041
Majid Javadi.

06:21.076 --> 06:25.045
Second in command of Iran's
Intelligence Directorate.

06:36.257 --> 06:37.691
Morning.

06:37.726 --> 06:39.393
Morning.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.341
His name is Alain Bernard.

06:54.376 --> 06:57.444
He didn't stay the night,
if that's what you're wondering.

06:57.479 --> 06:59.380
How un-French of him.

07:00.415 --> 07:02.816
We met in Mumbai.

07:02.851 --> 07:06.653
He was researching an article
on police corruption.

07:06.688 --> 07:08.655
You don't need to
explain yourself.

07:08.690 --> 07:11.458
Will you look at me, please?

07:18.800 --> 07:21.268
I didn't do
anything wrong, Saul.

07:21.302 --> 07:23.670
When I met him...

07:23.705 --> 07:26.840
you and I... had separated.

07:26.875 --> 07:29.309
Your decision...

07:29.344 --> 07:32.112
not mine.

07:32.147 --> 07:35.649
When your world collapsed...

07:35.683 --> 07:37.885
I came running.

07:37.919 --> 07:40.687
Yes. You did.

07:40.722 --> 07:44.391
But I left something behind.

07:44.426 --> 07:47.261
It was the whole life
I was starting there.

07:47.295 --> 07:49.296
So you're in love with him.

07:51.032 --> 07:52.366
Tell me.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.334
- Don't do this, Saul.
- It's a simple question.

07:54.369 --> 07:56.170
Yes or no-- do you love him?

07:56.204 --> 07:57.971
We have fun.

07:58.006 --> 07:59.840
He makes me laugh.
How's that?

07:59.874 --> 08:01.909
Today is better with him in it.

08:01.943 --> 08:05.446
That's all I needed to hear.

08:08.083 --> 08:09.450
Saul...

08:15.924 --> 08:17.658
You should know, the...

08:17.692 --> 08:21.395
President is nominating
Andrew Lockhart...

08:21.429 --> 08:24.231
as director
of Central Intelligence.

08:24.265 --> 08:26.300
What?

08:26.334 --> 08:28.168
When did this happen?

08:28.203 --> 08:31.705
Nothing happened.

08:31.739 --> 08:35.542
I don't think I was ever
really in the running.

08:36.910 --> 08:39.379
Well, I'm so sorry, Saul.

08:39.414 --> 08:41.215
Oh, don't be.

08:41.249 --> 08:42.649
I'm fine.

08:42.683 --> 08:45.586
For God's sake, Saul...

08:45.620 --> 08:47.488
stop this detached routine.

08:47.522 --> 08:50.357
Just get angry at something.

08:50.391 --> 08:52.259
Get angry at me.

08:52.293 --> 08:55.429
I don't have any claim
on you, Mira.

08:55.463 --> 08:57.764
No, but you do.

08:57.799 --> 08:59.967
Surely you know that.

09:02.337 --> 09:04.505
Not anymore.

09:19.053 --> 09:21.296
Do you still work for the CIA?

09:22.457 --> 09:23.891
Yes.

09:23.925 --> 09:25.526
You're an analyst.

09:25.560 --> 09:28.262
Case officer.

09:28.296 --> 09:29.997
A spy.

09:31.533 --> 09:34.835
Who's currently on
administrative leave.

09:36.671 --> 09:40.073
Does anyone else know
that you and I are meeting?

09:42.377 --> 09:43.911
No.

09:49.250 --> 09:53.820
Are you able to provide me
with information on CIA matters?

09:58.660 --> 10:01.762
I told Mr. Bennett that I
might be able to discuss

10:01.796 --> 10:04.498
some areas within certain
strict parameters.

10:04.532 --> 10:06.433
Yes or no?

10:06.467 --> 10:08.068
Please.

10:09.437 --> 10:11.805
I agreed to speak with
<i>you,</i> and you alone.

10:11.839 --> 10:13.040
I don't... I don't know

10:13.074 --> 10:14.474
these men--
they're making me nervous.

10:14.509 --> 10:16.443
You can trust them.

10:17.512 --> 10:19.913
Like you trust me.

10:46.074 --> 10:48.742
The machine says you're lying.

10:58.853 --> 11:01.121
Are we completely alone now?

11:01.155 --> 11:03.423
Is anyone else
listening to this?

11:03.458 --> 11:05.626
No. No one is listening.

11:05.660 --> 11:07.761
Shall we try this again? Hmm?

11:09.497 --> 11:11.131
No.

11:11.165 --> 11:12.866
No.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.401
We're done.

11:16.738 --> 11:18.972
What are you doing?

11:19.007 --> 11:22.542
It's time we talk
about Nassir Hejazi.

11:23.911 --> 11:25.712
Goalkeeper...

11:25.747 --> 11:28.782
for the 1978
Iran World Cup team.

11:28.816 --> 11:30.584
Whose name you used to embezzle

11:30.618 --> 11:34.855
more than $45 million from
the Revolutionary Guard.

11:35.890 --> 11:39.126
You are now an enemy
of your own state.

12:28.042 --> 12:30.410
Brava, Miss Mathison.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.646
Quite excellent.

12:36.784 --> 12:41.021
So, uh, when did you and Saul

12:41.055 --> 12:43.423
hatch this plan?

12:43.458 --> 12:47.027
You bombed the CIA 12/12.

12:47.061 --> 12:50.163
We got to work in the
early hours of 12/13.

12:50.198 --> 12:52.933
If you're considering
killing me or running,

12:52.967 --> 12:53.934
forget it.

12:53.968 --> 12:55.168
You're outnumbered
and outgunned,

12:55.203 --> 12:57.204
and you'll never get
off this property.

12:59.240 --> 13:03.009
So, why am I not
arrested already?

13:03.044 --> 13:05.445
Saul would like to
talk to you first.

13:05.480 --> 13:09.916
He used you to lure me.

13:09.951 --> 13:14.388
Saul Berenson--
still, after all these years,

13:14.422 --> 13:17.124
putting other people's lives
on the line.

13:20.628 --> 13:22.596
Tell your men that
your plan to recruit me

13:22.630 --> 13:24.598
as an asset has worked.

13:24.632 --> 13:26.099
Then I'll take you to Saul.

13:26.134 --> 13:27.734
Now?

13:28.770 --> 13:30.771
You can finish your cigarette.

13:30.805 --> 13:33.740
For me to leave
with you so quickly

13:33.775 --> 13:36.309
will arouse suspicion.

13:36.344 --> 13:38.345
You'll find a way.

13:38.379 --> 13:39.880
I know my men.

13:39.914 --> 13:40.881
I trained them.

13:40.915 --> 13:42.048
You command

13:42.083 --> 13:43.917
and they obey.

13:50.658 --> 13:53.493
The plan was to test you
with the lie detector

13:53.528 --> 13:58.365
and, if satisfied, to give you
a simple assignment.

13:58.399 --> 14:01.435
That is how we recruit
all of our assets.

14:01.469 --> 14:03.437
There is no plausible way
to explain

14:03.471 --> 14:05.505
a sudden change
in that procedure.

14:09.610 --> 14:11.678
What are you suggesting?

14:14.682 --> 14:18.051
I tell them I have instructed
you to retrieve an item

14:18.085 --> 14:21.087
of valuable intelligence
and deliver to me in person.

14:21.122 --> 14:23.957
Valuable intelligence?
Like what?

14:23.991 --> 14:28.528
The intelligence that led
to the six assassinations

14:28.563 --> 14:32.199
that your clandestine service
carried out around the world

14:32.233 --> 14:34.835
in response to the bombing
of Langley.

14:39.373 --> 14:41.374
I can have that
by this afternoon.

14:41.409 --> 14:43.276
That fast?

14:43.311 --> 14:44.611
I'm that good.

14:44.645 --> 14:47.481
Otherwise, why go to all
this trouble to recruit me?

14:47.515 --> 14:51.785
3:00 PM, seven
hours from now.

14:51.819 --> 14:52.786
Where?

14:52.820 --> 14:54.621
Exit one off the 270.

14:54.655 --> 14:57.657
There's a coffee shop right
there-- Raffi's Coffee Shop.

14:57.692 --> 14:58.959
Can't miss it.

14:58.993 --> 15:01.094
Falls Church train station
is what I had in mind.

15:01.128 --> 15:03.497
I just changed it.

15:03.531 --> 15:05.799
270, exit one,

15:05.833 --> 15:08.368
Raffi's Coffee.

15:08.402 --> 15:10.403
- Wait here.
- Make it quick.

15:14.375 --> 15:16.510
Saul should have instructed you

15:16.544 --> 15:19.613
to treat me
with more respect than that.

15:33.127 --> 15:36.263
Bring me the bank files
from Venezuela, please.

15:56.717 --> 15:58.919
Let's go.

16:08.396 --> 16:10.463
This way.

16:10.498 --> 16:13.300
Let's go.

16:13.334 --> 16:15.335
Where's Mr. Javadi?

16:22.209 --> 16:24.444
I need to speak with Mr.
Javadi again before I leave.

16:24.478 --> 16:26.980
Get in the car.

16:41.162 --> 16:43.663
Where would you like them?

16:43.698 --> 16:46.900
The Venezuela bank files.

16:52.673 --> 16:54.641
Is that Javadi?

16:55.943 --> 16:59.446
At a French restaurant
in Tehran with our wives.

17:01.816 --> 17:04.651
You and he were friends?

17:04.685 --> 17:06.685
We were young
intelligence officers

17:06.721 --> 17:09.122
during the dying
days of the Shah.

17:09.156 --> 17:10.490
Complicated times.

17:10.523 --> 17:12.659
Who's that?

17:12.693 --> 17:15.362
Sanjar Hootan, a professor
of political science

17:15.396 --> 17:16.496
at the University of Tehran.

17:16.530 --> 17:19.265
An agent of yours?

17:19.300 --> 17:21.568
One of four I recruited
there before the revolution.

17:23.204 --> 17:25.372
This is Tal'at Basari,

17:25.406 --> 17:26.839
a concert-level
pianist whose cousin

17:26.874 --> 17:28.608
had ties to Khomeini.

17:28.643 --> 17:31.645
What's their relevance
to you now?

17:33.681 --> 17:35.849
I had to get all four

17:35.883 --> 17:38.551
out of Iran after
the revolution.

17:38.586 --> 17:40.820
Their lives were in danger.

17:40.855 --> 17:42.522
Javadi offered to help.

17:42.556 --> 17:44.824
He said SAVAK still had a
safe house near the airport

17:44.859 --> 17:46.192
where they could stay

17:46.227 --> 17:48.395
while I got travel documents
together over at the embassy.

17:48.429 --> 17:49.696
When was this?

17:49.730 --> 17:52.666
May 1979.

17:52.700 --> 17:56.202
Country was in full
revolutionary crisis mode--

17:56.237 --> 17:59.472
Khomeini's thugs in the street

17:59.507 --> 18:02.509
trying to consolidate power.

18:02.543 --> 18:04.844
What happened?

18:06.914 --> 18:10.016
When I showed up at the house...

18:10.051 --> 18:12.986
their bodies were laid out

18:13.020 --> 18:16.823
on the carpet
side-by-side.

18:16.857 --> 18:18.158
I had promised them
the protection

18:18.192 --> 18:20.493
of the United
States government.

18:21.996 --> 18:24.664
Instead they got a bullet
to the back of their heads.

18:25.700 --> 18:27.834
Javadi.

18:27.868 --> 18:30.637
<i>It was his ticket</i>

18:30.671 --> 18:34.674
<i>into the new regime's</i>
<i>security services.</i>

18:34.709 --> 18:39.646
<i>I flew back to Washington,</i>
<i>handed in my resignation.</i>

18:39.680 --> 18:41.314
<i>Not only were my people dead,</i>

18:41.348 --> 18:46.119
<i>but I watched a man I thought</i>
<i>I knew become an animal...</i>

18:47.121 --> 18:49.923
in front of my eyes.

18:50.958 --> 18:53.693
So this operation
is your revenge.

18:53.728 --> 18:56.262
No.

18:56.297 --> 18:58.398
Revenge was when I helped
his wife and son escape

18:58.432 --> 19:01.201
to the West four months later.

19:04.505 --> 19:07.507
That's her-- Fariba.

19:13.547 --> 19:15.749
This isn't going to be easy,
is it?

19:20.921 --> 19:22.889
Turning an intelligence officer

19:22.923 --> 19:26.025
against his own country--

19:26.060 --> 19:29.696
well, that's the most delicate
and uncertain work there is.

19:29.730 --> 19:31.998
But he will turn, won't he?

19:32.032 --> 19:34.033
You do have
the advantage over him.

19:35.102 --> 19:38.338
Honestly, I don't know.

19:38.372 --> 19:41.007
Turning touches the
stubbornness in some people.

19:43.077 --> 19:45.845
<i>He's a stubborn man</i>
<i>to begin with.</i>

20:21.715 --> 20:23.817
Out.

21:00.688 --> 21:01.888
Hi, Mom.

21:01.922 --> 21:03.690
Hey.

21:03.724 --> 21:04.891
What's going on?

21:04.925 --> 21:06.426
I need your help.

21:06.460 --> 21:07.894
With what?

21:07.928 --> 21:09.495
Everything okay?

21:09.530 --> 21:10.763
Yeah.

21:10.798 --> 21:12.799
What's that?

21:16.904 --> 21:18.905
A name change application?

21:19.940 --> 21:22.575
I can't be Dana Brody anymore.

21:22.610 --> 21:23.843
Dana.

21:23.878 --> 21:26.512
I already made an appointment
at the courthouse.

21:28.148 --> 21:30.183
Well, what are you going
to change your name to?

21:30.217 --> 21:31.985
Lazaro.

21:32.019 --> 21:33.987
My maiden name?

21:34.021 --> 21:36.823
Is that a problem?

21:41.028 --> 21:42.996
When's your appointment?

21:43.030 --> 21:47.066
Well, they have an opening
in, like, an hour, actually.

21:47.101 --> 21:49.168
Do you think that
you could drive me?

21:51.171 --> 21:54.007
Please, Mom.

22:08.255 --> 22:10.223
Where are you?

22:10.257 --> 22:12.158
At my place.

22:12.192 --> 22:14.027
He wouldn't come
with me right away.

22:14.061 --> 22:16.629
Said it wouldn't fly
with his guys, it was too risky,

22:16.664 --> 22:18.398
so I set a meet for later.

22:18.432 --> 22:20.233
The plan was to bring him
straight here.

22:20.267 --> 22:21.801
I know what the plan was, Saul,

22:21.835 --> 22:23.636
but he had
a legitimate problem with it,

22:23.671 --> 22:26.005
and I... I made a call
in the moment.

22:27.241 --> 22:28.908
Where'd he take you?

22:29.944 --> 22:31.911
You don't know?

22:35.115 --> 22:36.950
We lost you.

22:36.984 --> 22:38.618
We knew it could happen
going in.

22:39.687 --> 22:42.455
Move on, please.

22:42.489 --> 22:45.224
2767 Green Meadow Drive,

22:45.259 --> 22:46.626
Stone Hearth Country Club,

22:46.660 --> 22:48.394
the northeast corner
of the ninth green.

22:48.429 --> 22:50.830
Get the drone
over that address now.

22:50.864 --> 22:52.632
Javadi could be anywhere by now.

22:52.666 --> 22:53.967
He's gonna be right
where you left him,

22:54.001 --> 22:55.702
I guarantee it.

22:55.736 --> 22:57.971
He's had at least an hour
without eyes on him.

22:58.005 --> 22:59.339
Which he can't possibly know.

22:59.373 --> 23:01.441
How did he react when you
dropped the hammer on him?

23:02.609 --> 23:05.712
Thousand-yard stare
for a few seconds.

23:05.746 --> 23:08.047
Then he began
to wriggle a little,

23:08.082 --> 23:09.716
reassert himself.

23:09.750 --> 23:11.751
He talked about you
a little bit, too.

23:11.785 --> 23:13.152
What'd he say?

23:15.522 --> 23:17.757
That, judging by the high-risk
nature of this operation,

23:17.791 --> 23:19.492
you don't seem
to have changed much.

23:19.526 --> 23:21.861
What were the details
of the meet you set?

23:21.895 --> 23:24.197
The 270, exit one at 3:00 PM.

23:24.231 --> 23:26.666
I'm to bring him the file on
how we hunted down his network.

23:26.700 --> 23:30.003
Okay, we'll get on that,
we'll doctor one up.

23:30.037 --> 23:33.006
Drone is now
over the golf course.

23:34.041 --> 23:35.608
See anything?

23:35.642 --> 23:37.543
No, it's very still.
Nobody's outside the house.

23:37.578 --> 23:38.811
I can't see inside.

23:38.846 --> 23:40.613
You've got to get actual eyes

23:40.647 --> 23:41.914
on Javadi, boots on the ground.

23:41.949 --> 23:43.883
Cannot afford to spook
him or alert his men.

23:43.917 --> 23:45.318
Not gonna happen.

23:45.352 --> 23:47.186
Well, how can we be sure
he's still there?

23:47.221 --> 23:48.621
I know this man.

23:48.655 --> 23:51.057
Survival's the only thing
on his mind right now.

23:51.091 --> 23:54.527
He will not take any
unnecessary risks with his life.

23:54.561 --> 23:56.396
You don't think
he could've changed a little

23:56.430 --> 23:58.064
since you last saw him?

23:58.098 --> 24:00.900
He will keep that
meeting with you.

24:00.934 --> 24:03.169
Until then, you should
get some sleep.

24:03.203 --> 24:05.238
Quinn will deliver the file
to you when it's ready

24:05.272 --> 24:07.306
and provide backup
at the meeting point.

24:07.341 --> 24:10.243
I hope you're right
about this, Saul.

24:10.277 --> 24:11.711
I am. Get some rest.

24:11.745 --> 24:13.746
You deserve it.

25:04.553 --> 25:10.234
_

26:12.266 --> 26:14.233
Mr. Adal.

26:14.268 --> 26:15.501
Senator.

26:15.536 --> 26:17.670
The director apologizes
for not being here

26:17.704 --> 26:19.972
and has asked me
to take the meeting for him.

26:22.342 --> 26:24.310
- Lead the way.
- Yeah.

26:27.681 --> 26:29.582
Where is the director?

26:29.616 --> 26:30.917
I'm afraid I don't know.

26:30.951 --> 26:34.187
He chose not to
share that with me.

26:34.221 --> 26:36.722
Well, I, for one, am very glad
to have this opportunity

26:36.757 --> 26:38.591
to visit with you,
Mr. Adal.

26:38.625 --> 26:40.326
Thank you, Senator.

26:40.360 --> 26:42.328
Likewise.

26:51.605 --> 26:53.306
May I speak plainly?

26:53.340 --> 26:54.974
Of course.

26:55.008 --> 26:58.945
The Agency is a mess.

26:58.979 --> 27:01.347
- Okay.
- As far as I can see,

27:01.381 --> 27:03.282
it's being driven
into the fucking ground.

27:03.317 --> 27:05.484
By poor decision-making

27:05.519 --> 27:07.887
and god-awful
leadership.

27:07.921 --> 27:09.889
The hope is that
you are the reformer

27:09.923 --> 27:12.158
your record in the Senate
and on the Select Committee

27:12.192 --> 27:13.326
would indicate.

27:13.360 --> 27:17.663
So, then, you agree
that change is in order,

27:17.698 --> 27:19.398
no matter how painful.

27:19.433 --> 27:22.235
In light of the worst attack
this Agency has ever suffered,

27:22.269 --> 27:23.836
yes, I do.

27:23.870 --> 27:26.138
How did this happen?

27:26.173 --> 27:28.174
The past is the past.

27:28.208 --> 27:30.576
I'm more interested
in what happens next.

27:31.878 --> 27:36.115
What happens next is
that we reclaim the respect

27:36.149 --> 27:37.650
and the fear

27:37.684 --> 27:41.621
that the world used to have
for this Agency's hard punch.

27:41.655 --> 27:44.824
Reminiscent of some of the
work you yourself have done.

27:44.858 --> 27:46.225
In Somalia,

27:46.260 --> 27:48.227
in Libya, Uganda.

27:50.063 --> 27:53.298
How can I be of service,
Senator?

27:54.701 --> 27:58.504
My confirmation hearing
is in 12 days.

27:58.538 --> 28:02.375
I don't want any surprises
on my first day as director.

28:04.044 --> 28:06.379
No skeletons,

28:06.413 --> 28:08.481
no unfinished business,

28:08.515 --> 28:10.950
no more Sergeant Brodys,

28:10.984 --> 28:13.486
no Carrie Mathisons.

28:15.289 --> 28:17.857
God forbid.

28:24.464 --> 28:25.598
Yeah?

28:25.632 --> 28:26.599
It's me.

28:26.633 --> 28:28.334
I'm here. Out back.

28:28.368 --> 28:29.535
Hold on.

28:37.077 --> 28:38.377
You're early.

28:38.411 --> 28:39.878
Always good to have a cushion.

28:39.913 --> 28:41.280
You get much sleep?

28:41.314 --> 28:43.082
Some.

28:43.116 --> 28:44.617
What's the latest on Javadi?

28:44.651 --> 28:46.619
Well, the drone picked up
a car-- a Buick-- headed

28:46.653 --> 28:48.954
for the golf course house about
an hour after you called in.

28:48.989 --> 28:50.723
Have we actually seen
if Javadi's still there?

28:50.757 --> 28:52.191
- No.
- Well, then that car

28:52.225 --> 28:53.425
doesn't mean shit.

28:54.427 --> 28:56.161
You bring me the file?

28:57.397 --> 28:59.698
Yeah. Verifiable
electronic intelligence

28:59.733 --> 29:01.700
on how we hunted down
those six targets.

29:01.735 --> 29:03.636
No mention of sources
or anything like that, but...

29:03.670 --> 29:05.638
enough to make the suits
in Tehran know

29:05.672 --> 29:07.439
that Javadi recruited
the right girl.

29:07.474 --> 29:09.041
If he shows.

29:09.075 --> 29:11.243
Saul's convinced he will.

29:19.519 --> 29:20.819
I know what you're thinking.

29:20.854 --> 29:23.255
No, you don't.

29:23.289 --> 29:24.823
Brody is America's
most wanted man.

29:24.858 --> 29:26.225
You're looking for possible

29:26.259 --> 29:28.894
sightings of him
because it's your job.

29:33.366 --> 29:35.367
New burner phone.
Give me your old one.

29:39.839 --> 29:41.840
All right. Let's go.

29:46.780 --> 29:49.548
L-A-Z-A-R-O.

29:49.582 --> 29:51.016
Lazaro.

29:51.051 --> 29:52.885
And are we keeping
the same first name?

29:52.919 --> 29:54.920
Yes.

29:56.356 --> 29:58.991
How long does it take?

29:59.025 --> 30:01.493
Three to six weeks.

30:01.495 --> 30:05.464
That'll be
$41.14, please.

30:05.498 --> 30:07.466
I've got money.

30:15.575 --> 30:17.076
Is that it?

30:17.110 --> 30:19.745
Oh. Just a signature here.

30:19.779 --> 30:21.413
Um...

30:21.448 --> 30:22.748
old name or new name?

30:22.782 --> 30:25.751
Birth name, where it
says "Applicant."

30:38.098 --> 30:39.431
Thanks.

30:42.602 --> 30:44.903
You seem like a nice young lady.

30:44.938 --> 30:47.906
Must have Mom to
thank for that.

30:50.076 --> 30:52.244
Um, I-I just...
I-I can't imagine

30:52.278 --> 30:53.846
what y'all are going through.

30:55.915 --> 30:58.350
Would you permit me
to pray for you?

30:58.384 --> 30:59.885
Of course.

30:59.919 --> 31:01.420
Thank you very much.

31:01.454 --> 31:03.188
God bless.

31:05.325 --> 31:07.292
Come on.
Let's go home.

31:18.605 --> 31:20.873
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

31:20.907 --> 31:23.075
- Sit in the window so I can see you.
- Right.

31:29.816 --> 31:31.750
Is Javadi moving yet?

31:31.785 --> 31:34.119
Nothing yet.
All quiet.

31:34.154 --> 31:36.455
He's still in that house
going through his options.

31:36.489 --> 31:38.157
That's what I'd be doing.

31:38.191 --> 31:39.625
He's cutting it pretty fine.

31:39.659 --> 31:41.026
By being late,
he's making a point.

31:41.060 --> 31:42.060
Which is?

31:42.095 --> 31:43.629
You may have me over a barrel,

31:43.663 --> 31:44.963
but I'll never be your bitch.

31:46.432 --> 31:48.300
There's movement.
Something's happening.

31:50.370 --> 31:51.570
It's him.

31:51.604 --> 31:53.572
He's getting in the car.

31:58.812 --> 32:00.279
He's heading west...

32:00.313 --> 32:02.080
towards 270.

32:02.115 --> 32:05.250
So far, so good.

32:05.285 --> 32:06.852
I better take this.

32:06.886 --> 32:07.786
Stand by, Carrie.

32:07.821 --> 32:10.189
This is it.

32:10.223 --> 32:13.025
Put him through.

32:13.059 --> 32:15.027
- Saul.
- How was Lockhart?

32:15.061 --> 32:16.528
Disappointed not to see you.

32:16.563 --> 32:17.729
I can imagine.

32:17.764 --> 32:20.132
But I think
we had a productive meeting.

32:20.166 --> 32:22.134
Anything specific?

32:22.168 --> 32:24.636
No. He's just trying to get
his bearings before the big day.

32:24.671 --> 32:25.771
Of course he is.

32:25.805 --> 32:28.540
Anxious for a smooth transition
of power.

32:28.575 --> 32:30.776
That's what he said?

32:30.810 --> 32:34.279
While remaining respectful
of the work you've done.

32:34.314 --> 32:35.781
Sir!

32:35.815 --> 32:37.783
We need you inside right away.

32:37.817 --> 32:39.284
I got to go.

32:46.559 --> 32:48.527
He was headed south on 270,

32:48.561 --> 32:50.462
but he got off exit nine.

32:50.496 --> 32:51.797
Where's Carrie again?

32:51.831 --> 32:54.199
- Exit one.
- Maybe he needs gas.

32:54.234 --> 32:55.868
Apparently not.

32:55.902 --> 32:57.402
Carrie, you hearing this?
I need you on the Beltway,

32:57.437 --> 32:58.804
heading north to intercept. Now.

32:58.838 --> 33:00.472
Copy that.

33:09.849 --> 33:11.650
He's turning east onto...

33:11.684 --> 33:14.519
Mulberry Road.

33:18.524 --> 33:20.092
He's cruising
a residential area.

33:20.126 --> 33:21.660
Small streets.

33:21.694 --> 33:23.395
Lots of trees.

33:23.429 --> 33:25.063
Run a check to see what, if any,

33:25.098 --> 33:26.365
Iranian Americans live
in the area.

33:26.399 --> 33:27.432
Racial profiling
by neighborhood?

33:27.467 --> 33:29.768
FBI calls it domain management.

33:29.802 --> 33:31.770
- I'll check their database.
- I can do that.

33:31.804 --> 33:33.505
You stay on Javadi.

33:33.539 --> 33:35.040
He's slowing down

33:35.074 --> 33:37.075
to almost a crawl now.

33:39.078 --> 33:41.079
What the hell is he looking for?

33:55.762 --> 33:59.531
He stopped.
Uh, 1426 Longhill Road.

34:12.078 --> 34:15.880
1426 Longhill Road belongs
to Vincent D Carlyle,

34:15.915 --> 34:18.317
who rents it out through
ACB Property Management.

34:18.351 --> 34:19.618
Well, who's the tenant?

34:22.621 --> 34:26.058
The house was rented out
by Susan Roberts, CPA

34:26.092 --> 34:27.759
with Brown and Getz
in Annandale.

34:27.793 --> 34:30.963
Wait, uh, Roberts is
not her married name.

34:30.996 --> 34:34.099
The lease was originally
cosigned by her ex-husband...

34:34.132 --> 34:35.701
Nasser Javadi.

34:35.735 --> 34:38.003
They have
a two-year-old son, Behrouz.

34:38.036 --> 34:39.670
Where are you, Carrie?

34:39.706 --> 34:42.107
Just past exit eight,
five minutes out.

34:42.141 --> 34:44.342
- He's getting out of the car.
- He cannot go

34:44.377 --> 34:45.911
inside that house.
You must stop him

34:45.945 --> 34:47.679
going in that house,
do you copy?

34:47.714 --> 34:49.114
Copy that.

34:49.148 --> 34:51.650
For Christ's sake, Carrie,

34:51.684 --> 34:52.985
hurry.

35:08.167 --> 35:09.167
Hello.

35:09.202 --> 35:11.536
Hello.

35:13.573 --> 35:15.640
Can I help you?

35:15.675 --> 35:17.642
Do you know who I am?

35:17.677 --> 35:20.545
Fariba's ex-husband.

35:20.580 --> 35:22.014
Yes. Majid.

35:22.048 --> 35:23.715
And you must be Susan.

35:23.750 --> 35:26.852
Is that my grandson, Behrouz?

35:26.886 --> 35:29.287
May I come in and say hello?

35:30.590 --> 35:32.891
Would you mind
waiting just a second?

35:32.925 --> 35:34.026
Of course.

36:21.441 --> 36:23.742
Hey.

36:25.812 --> 36:27.846
Susan, do you want me

36:27.880 --> 36:30.582
to take Behrouz to the park?

36:31.651 --> 36:33.752
Hello, Fariba.

36:53.940 --> 36:55.540
No! No! No!

36:55.575 --> 36:56.975
You betrayed us!

36:57.009 --> 36:58.610
You betrayed us.

36:58.644 --> 37:00.812
No! No! No!

37:05.785 --> 37:08.687
Stop or I shoot.

37:13.192 --> 37:15.827
Show me your hands.

37:15.862 --> 37:17.028
Someone talk to me.

37:22.935 --> 37:26.471
Now I'm ready to see Saul.

37:27.673 --> 37:30.308
Oh, Jesus.

37:30.343 --> 37:33.979
One of you tell me, please,
what the fuck is happening.

37:34.013 --> 37:37.449
He shot his daughter-in-law
in the head, and then he, uh...

37:37.483 --> 37:40.285
There's two fatalities
and a lot of blood.

37:40.319 --> 37:41.753
Who's the second fatality?

37:44.624 --> 37:46.591
Hold on.

37:49.295 --> 37:51.263
Who's she?

37:51.297 --> 37:54.633
Tell Saul it's my ex-wife.

37:54.667 --> 37:56.201
Fariba.

37:56.235 --> 37:59.471
He took a bottle to her neck.

37:59.505 --> 38:01.806
He killed her
with a fucking bottle.

38:03.709 --> 38:05.944
Fariba--
what's she doing there?

38:05.978 --> 38:08.647
She's meant to be in Witness
Protection in California.

38:08.681 --> 38:10.815
It's a fucking bloodbath, Saul.

38:10.850 --> 38:13.952
You got to get him out of there
as fast as possible

38:13.986 --> 38:15.420
and get the murder weapon,
you understand?

38:15.454 --> 38:17.956
Jesus fucking Christ.

38:17.990 --> 38:19.791
Do you understand?

38:19.825 --> 38:21.026
Yeah, I understand.

38:21.060 --> 38:22.794
Leave your car
a couple blocks away, then

38:22.828 --> 38:24.329
bring him here in his car.
We'll get yours later.

38:24.363 --> 38:25.530
You were never there.

38:25.565 --> 38:26.698
Follow the procedure.

38:26.732 --> 38:28.633
Check for security
cameras, et cetera.

38:28.668 --> 38:31.002
There's a baby in here.
What do we do about the baby?

38:31.037 --> 38:32.337
Leave it.

38:32.371 --> 38:34.105
What? We can't do that.

38:34.140 --> 38:35.874
Can't take the baby.

38:35.908 --> 38:37.042
You weren't there.

38:38.477 --> 38:40.478
Oh, f...

38:41.948 --> 38:46.651
It'll be all right.
It's okay. It's okay.

38:46.686 --> 38:50.789
Come here. Come here. Yeah.

38:50.823 --> 38:51.856
Come here.

38:51.891 --> 38:53.858
You're all right.

38:56.229 --> 38:57.762
We've got to get out of here.

39:21.420 --> 39:23.388
Dana Lazaro.

39:23.422 --> 39:24.689
Sounds pretty cool.

39:24.724 --> 39:26.124
Kind of does, doesn't it?

39:27.360 --> 39:28.860
I'll get it.

39:37.270 --> 39:38.937
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:38.971 --> 39:40.939
I'm a friend of Dana's.

39:40.973 --> 39:42.907
Angela.

39:42.942 --> 39:45.577
Angela. Do you want to come in?

39:48.714 --> 39:50.849
Dana?

39:53.386 --> 39:55.620
Are you hungry?

39:55.655 --> 39:57.722
I'm just here, you know,
to pick her up.

39:57.757 --> 40:00.225
Where are you guys going?

40:03.796 --> 40:06.965
Like, camping?

40:06.999 --> 40:09.868
No, Mom.

40:11.971 --> 40:13.938
I'm moving.

40:13.973 --> 40:16.508
To Angela's.

40:19.211 --> 40:21.446
Okay. No, you're not.

40:21.480 --> 40:24.616
I don't even know Angela.
No offense.

40:24.650 --> 40:26.384
Maybe I should wait in the car.

40:26.419 --> 40:27.986
I think that's a good idea.

40:28.020 --> 40:29.988
I'll be out in a minute.

40:33.192 --> 40:35.994
What, you were just
going to sneak out?

40:36.028 --> 40:38.163
I told you, Mom.

40:38.197 --> 40:41.499
I can't be Dana Brody anymore.

40:41.534 --> 40:43.368
Right, and we went
to the courthouse,

40:43.402 --> 40:45.003
and we filled out
all those forms.

40:45.037 --> 40:47.439
It's not just about my name.

40:49.308 --> 40:51.409
You can't suddenly just leave.

40:53.045 --> 40:54.346
It's not sudden.

40:54.380 --> 40:55.680
For you, maybe.

40:55.715 --> 40:58.083
You've been thinking
about it, obviously,

40:58.117 --> 40:59.584
but you never told me.

40:59.618 --> 41:01.319
You told Angela,
whoever that is.

41:01.354 --> 41:02.687
She's my friend.

41:02.722 --> 41:04.356
Don't take it out on her.

41:07.526 --> 41:09.728
Dana, we haven't even
talked about this.

41:11.831 --> 41:13.898
There's no point in
talking about this,

41:13.933 --> 41:16.000
because there's
nothing to talk about.

41:19.004 --> 41:20.972
Mom,

41:21.006 --> 41:24.776
I can't live this life anymore.

41:25.811 --> 41:27.812
I just can't.

41:29.915 --> 41:32.083
I mean...

41:32.118 --> 41:34.185
it nearly killed me.

41:38.491 --> 41:40.825
I've got to leave.

41:45.664 --> 41:48.333
Oh, God.

41:55.040 --> 41:57.075
I love you so much.

42:01.313 --> 42:03.281
I love you, too.

42:18.397 --> 42:20.365
I'm gonna go now.

42:20.399 --> 42:21.800
Okay?

42:21.834 --> 42:23.902
Wait. Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

43:02.775 --> 43:04.843
Dana, wait.

43:04.877 --> 43:07.212
There's still $300
left on that.

43:07.246 --> 43:08.746
Mom, no.

43:08.781 --> 43:10.748
Please take it.

43:10.783 --> 43:12.584
I need to do this on my own.

43:12.618 --> 43:14.919
You don't have to use it.
Just take it.

43:25.564 --> 43:26.898
Bye.

43:26.932 --> 43:29.067
Bye.

44:00.165 --> 44:02.066
Looks like they beat us to it.

44:02.101 --> 44:03.234
Someone must have called it in

44:03.269 --> 44:04.836
before we could get over here
to clean up.

44:04.838 --> 44:07.572
Got a police homicide squad
already in overdrive over here.

44:07.606 --> 44:09.207
Keep moving.

44:09.241 --> 44:10.608
Don't stop.

45:46.739 --> 45:48.573
Hands.

46:14.500 --> 46:17.568
This is just
the fucking beginning.

46:34.119 --> 46:35.586
You okay?

46:37.923 --> 46:40.291
I don't know what I am.

46:47.666 --> 46:49.734
Shall we?

47:04.950 --> 47:07.285
Take the chains off.

47:20.632 --> 47:22.033
Stand up.

47:31.443 --> 47:32.810
Saul.

47:32.845 --> 47:35.680
You don't look like a
man who just landed

47:35.714 --> 47:37.482
the biggest asset
of his career.
