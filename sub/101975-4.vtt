00:01.485 --> 00:04.244
<i> -Previously on</i> The Resident...
-I saw Yorn.

00:04.396 --> 00:06.230
-Did he say why
he hasn't hired a CEO?
-They're selling the hospital.

00:06.290 --> 00:07.989
-Oh.
-I need to show Yorn
that Chastain

00:08.050 --> 00:09.550
is worth a hell of a lot more
than he thinks it is.

00:11.628 --> 00:12.919
My father, when he died,

00:13.072 --> 00:14.662
I didn't even get
to say goodbye.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.999
<i> What I would do for just</i>
<i> one more day with my dad.</i>

00:18.060 --> 00:20.777
Sorry. Losing someone
is never easy.

00:20.779 --> 00:22.170
I'll get someone
to cover for you.

00:22.231 --> 00:23.930
No.

00:24.025 --> 00:27.175
I'm okay. I just need a minute.

00:27.236 --> 00:30.512
(takes deep breath)
It's official.

00:30.573 --> 00:33.866
A baby?
(laughing)

00:34.017 --> 00:35.183
(laughs)

00:35.286 --> 00:37.519
-(bell tinkles)
-(laughs): What is this?

00:37.538 --> 00:40.188
Uh, breakfast in bed.

00:40.249 --> 00:42.690
-Where did you even get this?
-Ah...

00:42.752 --> 00:44.359
NIC:
Pancakes?

00:44.420 --> 00:46.286
Your favorite.

00:46.422 --> 00:48.255
-Blue wildflowers.
-Aw...

00:50.334 --> 00:53.260
Nic's favorite berries. Ah!

00:53.387 --> 00:55.295
Get in there, get in there.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.130
All right. Mmm. Mmm.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.541
Whose dad do we want
to call first, yours or mine?

00:59.602 --> 01:02.061
I think we should wait
a little longer.

01:02.212 --> 01:05.455
Well, sure,
there's no rush to tell anyone.

01:05.474 --> 01:07.149
I mean, right?

01:10.387 --> 01:12.071
Your pregnancy
is already further along

01:12.222 --> 01:13.555
than it was last time.

01:13.616 --> 01:15.982
This time is gonna be different,
and it's...

01:16.077 --> 01:18.393
it's gonna be okay.
You know that, right?

01:18.412 --> 01:20.746
But we can't.

01:20.939 --> 01:24.833
I had a miscarriage,
and it was awful.

01:25.777 --> 01:27.419
And if it happens again,

01:27.588 --> 01:29.996
I don't want
to have to tell everyone,

01:30.132 --> 01:32.574
so I just...

01:32.635 --> 01:35.886
just want to wait
a little longer, okay?

01:39.100 --> 01:40.265
Of course.

01:40.458 --> 01:42.726
Whatever you want.

01:44.129 --> 01:45.771
Thank you.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.165
(knocking on door)

01:48.225 --> 01:49.516
(Devon groans)

01:49.652 --> 01:51.168
(knocking continues)

01:51.228 --> 01:52.778
I'm coming.

01:52.971 --> 01:54.929
(groans)

01:54.990 --> 01:56.949
(rapid knocking)

01:57.118 --> 01:59.343
All right!

02:00.121 --> 02:03.580
Did I park in someone's spot
or something?

02:05.459 --> 02:07.876
-(rapid knocking)
-(sighs) Okay!

02:09.413 --> 02:10.629
Mom. What are you...

02:10.822 --> 02:12.297
-what are you doing here?
-Surprise.

02:12.449 --> 02:14.758
I thought I'd
finally come visit my s...

02:16.587 --> 02:18.862
What happened to you?

02:18.922 --> 02:22.624
Oh, my God.
Were you in a car accident?

02:22.685 --> 02:24.792
I knew something was wrong.
I knew it.

02:24.854 --> 02:26.553
A mother always knows.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.129
Mom, I'm fine.

02:28.149 --> 02:30.798
We had an ER patient
with psychosis,

02:30.860 --> 02:34.802
and... someone should have
restrained him immediately,

02:34.864 --> 02:37.972
but we missed it,
and then he was...

02:38.033 --> 02:40.308
swinging at a nurse, and I...

02:40.327 --> 02:42.327
uh, went in to help.

02:42.520 --> 02:46.056
Yeah, in retrospect, I should
have just left it to the...

02:46.116 --> 02:47.666
security.

02:47.859 --> 02:49.817
You are a hero.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.579
My poor boy.
(sighs)

02:52.731 --> 02:54.339
But where are your pajamas, huh?

02:54.532 --> 02:55.565
And, uh...

02:55.626 --> 02:57.509
what is that smell?

02:57.661 --> 02:59.994
You know, just wait right here.
I just got to... I'll wash up.

03:00.055 --> 03:01.346
Hey, don't worry.

03:01.498 --> 03:04.607
I-I'm going to take care
of everything.

03:04.609 --> 03:05.893
(sighs)

03:09.381 --> 03:11.565
(panting)

03:17.105 --> 03:20.273
-(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)
-(footsteps approaching)

03:20.367 --> 03:21.758
(Austin chuckles)

03:21.777 --> 03:23.443
The way you drive
like a hellion,

03:23.595 --> 03:25.204
I was sure you'd beat me here.

03:25.355 --> 03:27.855
Normally, I would beat you here,
because you drive like a nun,

03:27.917 --> 03:30.600
but today... I stopped for this.

03:30.661 --> 03:31.952
-Doughnuts.
-Mm.

03:32.046 --> 03:34.604
Maple. I believe
they're your favorite.

03:34.665 --> 03:36.606
(chuckles)
And I believe you mentioned

03:36.667 --> 03:39.125
a fondness
for breakfast burritos.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.777
Oh, I do not hate

03:40.837 --> 03:42.721
this part of being
in a relationship.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.890
Oh, such high praise.

03:45.059 --> 03:48.635
Tell me, what can I do to make
sure you stay this effusive?

03:48.729 --> 03:50.954
There is one thing.

03:51.014 --> 03:54.399
Uh, you can...
(takes deep breath)

03:54.592 --> 03:57.194
marry me.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.198
â™ª

04:12.586 --> 04:15.479
My 0-1 visa is expiring.

04:15.497 --> 04:18.924
I knew it was coming,
so I applied way in advance.

04:19.075 --> 04:21.318
Yesterday I found out
it was denied.

04:21.420 --> 04:23.595
Mina, you should have
told me this yesterday.

04:23.788 --> 04:25.764
I was gonna tell you
when I came over last night,

04:25.957 --> 04:27.915
but you had made
such a nice dinner,

04:27.977 --> 04:31.770
and I didn't want to ruin it,
so... I said nothing.

04:31.963 --> 04:34.940
And then we got occupied
with other things.

04:36.301 --> 04:38.110
I don't understand
why the government

04:38.303 --> 04:39.594
would deny your renewal,

04:39.613 --> 04:41.338
as many American lives
as you've saved.

04:41.398 --> 04:45.008
Since February of 2020,
Nigerians are no longer able

04:45.068 --> 04:49.179
to obtain visas to immigrate
to the U.S. permanently.

04:49.239 --> 04:50.956
If I want to stay,
I have to find a way

04:51.149 --> 04:54.751
to renew my current visa
or marry an American citizen.

04:56.613 --> 05:00.281
-You are terrible at this.
-I applied months in advance.

05:00.301 --> 05:01.691
No, no, I mean this.

05:01.752 --> 05:04.044
You know, Mina,
proposals usually come...

05:04.138 --> 05:05.879
with a ring.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.807
-And a carefully crafted speech
-(clears throat)

05:09.000 --> 05:11.568
about commitment and love,
full of compliments.

05:11.570 --> 05:13.386
Flowers wouldn't hurt, either.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.038
-Okay, so will you do it?
-(stammers)

05:15.098 --> 05:17.057
You didn't even buy me
a nice dinner first.

05:17.151 --> 05:19.151
I got you doughnuts.

05:19.344 --> 05:21.903
True. And they're maple.

05:23.365 --> 05:25.490
Hey. Come here.

05:25.683 --> 05:27.551
Mm...
(inhales)

05:27.611 --> 05:29.553
Breathe.

05:29.613 --> 05:32.164
It's gonna be okay, Mina.

05:32.315 --> 05:33.557
We can make this work.

05:33.617 --> 05:35.167
All right?

05:35.360 --> 05:37.985
Love.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.153
Honor.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.413
Obey.

05:40.566 --> 05:42.824
Ooh, I love the way that sounds.

05:42.885 --> 05:44.584
-Don't you?
-Okay, uh,

05:44.736 --> 05:45.844
maybe we are rushing this.

05:45.995 --> 05:48.438
Oh, no,
we're definitely rushing this.

05:48.440 --> 05:49.806
(Austin chuckles)

05:53.854 --> 05:56.337
What's that about?

05:56.473 --> 05:58.231
Good morning.

05:59.684 --> 06:01.777
Good question.

06:02.854 --> 06:05.088
How's the other guy look?

06:05.107 --> 06:06.606
Funny.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.425
I couldn't sleep,
so I went out for a bike ride

06:08.485 --> 06:09.851
in the middle of the night.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.612
And it was pitch black,
and I was tired.

06:12.764 --> 06:13.855
Yeah, I know.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.481
-It was stupid.
-Mm.

06:15.584 --> 06:18.451
I, uh, hit a curb
and I wiped out.

06:18.587 --> 06:21.788
Oh, and then my mother showed up
this morning unannounced and,

06:21.940 --> 06:23.289
uh, I lied to her about it,

06:23.425 --> 06:24.791
because I didn't want her
to worry.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.636
(scoffs)
Anything else you want to know?

06:29.056 --> 06:32.632
Well, your father
passed away, and...

06:32.726 --> 06:34.467
It's been months.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.136
-I'm fine.
-You're not fine.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.304
You're grieving. You don't need
to put a timeline on it.

06:38.457 --> 06:39.973
Getting through it takes
as long as it takes.

06:40.125 --> 06:41.900
-Let's just talk
about how you're feeling.
-Okay.

06:42.051 --> 06:43.885
I said fine.

06:43.946 --> 06:46.053
You don't need to ask me again.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.814
WOMAN:
Excuse me? Excuse me?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.649
Can we get some help?

06:49.743 --> 06:51.651
Okay, what's going on?

06:51.745 --> 06:53.319
My daughter Trinity needs
medical attention.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.321
No, I don't.

06:55.416 --> 06:57.323
What's happening, Trinity?

06:57.418 --> 06:58.417
Show them.

06:58.568 --> 07:00.252
It looks worse than it is.

07:03.799 --> 07:05.090
My mom is making this
a big thing.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.651
Your hand looks like
a sea monster.

07:07.752 --> 07:10.578
It's a big thing.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.338
Whatever.
I tripped on the stairs.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.748
You, too?

07:13.809 --> 07:17.084
Um, bike accident.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.419
I don't need sedation.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.087
Just pop my fingers
back into place.

07:20.149 --> 07:22.832
Trust me,
I have a high pain tolerance.

07:22.851 --> 07:24.851
Look how well she tolerated
the existential pain

07:24.945 --> 07:28.171
of being stuck at home
with her mom during lockdown.

07:28.231 --> 07:30.115
I was supposed to speak
at my graduation.

07:30.308 --> 07:31.950
Then I didn't go to college
in the fall

07:32.119 --> 07:34.194
'cause it's all
distance learning.

07:34.288 --> 07:37.030
Apologies for our family drama.
It's been a year.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.823
Well, we're ready
to fix your fingers

07:39.017 --> 07:40.792
if you really want to do it
that way.

07:40.985 --> 07:42.461
-CONRAD: Positive?
-Yep.

07:42.654 --> 07:43.962
Okay.

07:46.291 --> 07:48.300
Trinity, look at your mom.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.362
Let's remember the good parts
of lockdown.

07:52.422 --> 07:55.122
-(cracks)
-(grunting)

07:55.258 --> 07:57.033
The tap shoes.

07:57.093 --> 07:58.626
-The quail.
-(cracks)
-(grunts)

07:58.687 --> 08:00.294
-Quail?
-We incubated eggs

08:00.355 --> 08:02.630
and raised them to adulthood.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.966
-Kept the only girl.
-Sidney Vicious.

08:05.027 --> 08:07.819
Ah, Sidney Vicious.
I love that name.

08:07.971 --> 08:09.988
She's coming with me
when I get my own apartment,

08:10.157 --> 08:12.473
which I'm supposed
to look at today.

08:12.534 --> 08:13.825
(whispers):
Finally.

08:13.977 --> 08:15.309
You're all done.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.621
You should be good
to apartment hunt now.

08:19.115 --> 08:20.999
Actually,
there's something else.

08:21.150 --> 08:23.226
-This wasn't
Trinity's first fall.
-Mom, stop.

08:23.286 --> 08:24.503
You said we didn't have to...

08:24.654 --> 08:25.745
She's been off lately.

08:25.897 --> 08:27.655
Something
with her balance, maybe.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.156
We can take a look at that.

08:29.218 --> 08:31.176
I said no.
I just want to go and get my...

08:31.369 --> 08:33.512
If you want a cosigner
for that apartment,

08:33.705 --> 08:36.330
you will stay in that bed
and let the doctors work.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.907
CONRAD:
It will be quick.

08:37.926 --> 08:39.909
We'll get X-rays on your hand
just to be safe.

08:39.970 --> 08:42.169
And then we'll be back
for a full physical.

08:42.231 --> 08:43.980
I'll let imaging know.

08:48.770 --> 08:52.013
<i> MAN (over P.A.):</i>
<i> Procurement coordinator</i>
<i> to the ICU.</i>

08:52.074 --> 08:53.940
Quail.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.183
Maybe Nic and I need
to bring some variety

08:56.286 --> 08:57.518
to our chicken coop, huh?

08:57.538 --> 09:00.187
Well, it sounds like Trinity...

09:00.290 --> 09:03.116
wants independence
more than any bird.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.102
I hear the mother-daughter thing
can be tough sometimes.

09:06.121 --> 09:08.121
Yeah, the mother-son thing is
no walk in the park, either.

09:08.257 --> 09:10.549
My mom wants to know
where I keep the disinfectant,

09:10.717 --> 09:12.776
the trash bags,
the<i> good</i> toilet paper.

09:12.836 --> 09:15.887
-(laughs)
-This is the last thing
I need right now.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.447
I don't know. Maybe
you can set some boundaries

09:17.465 --> 09:19.683
with her or something?

09:22.120 --> 09:24.788
I'm not really looking
for advice here.

09:24.848 --> 09:26.623
I'm doing my job,
I'm not making any mistakes.

09:26.683 --> 09:28.233
Anything beyond that
is not your business.

09:28.426 --> 09:30.643
It's my business that my friend
is upset and grieving.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.071
Can you stop trying
to doctor this?

09:33.264 --> 09:35.681
Okay? I need a minute.
Can you handle the exam?

09:35.784 --> 09:38.034
-Yeah.
-Okay.

09:43.274 --> 09:45.158
So the good news is
that the PR coming in

09:45.252 --> 09:47.477
from my show's segment
on the patient helped.

09:47.495 --> 09:50.071
And Yorn thinks that Chastain
might still be valuable enough

09:50.090 --> 09:52.239
to take selling the hospital
off the table.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.575
The bad news is,

09:54.595 --> 09:58.245
they're talking about filling
the empty CEO seat with me.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.173
I thought you weren't keen
on the job anymore,

10:00.267 --> 10:02.826
-you were focusing on surgery.
-Trust me, I don't want it.

10:02.844 --> 10:04.603
Even if I said yes,

10:04.796 --> 10:06.438
Red Rock could
still dump Chastain

10:06.589 --> 10:08.255
if we don't rebound financially.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.941
And we'd be under the thumb
of some other conglomerate.

10:10.134 --> 10:11.851
And there are companies
out there

10:11.945 --> 10:14.504
that are way worse
than Red Rock.

10:14.564 --> 10:17.357
Well, here's something
to cheer you up.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.509
There's a rather attractive
young woman over there

10:19.569 --> 10:21.119
who can't take her eyes off you.

10:21.312 --> 10:23.455
Do you know her?

10:25.125 --> 10:26.625
No.

10:26.818 --> 10:28.184
-No.
-Oh.

10:28.286 --> 10:30.253
Here she comes.

10:31.356 --> 10:33.039
I'm so sorry to interrupt,

10:33.133 --> 10:34.691
but can I?

10:34.751 --> 10:36.617
Interrupt, I mean?
(laughs)

10:36.720 --> 10:38.285
I love your show.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.971
-Ah.
-That segment on scurvy.

10:40.123 --> 10:42.790
I-I don't have scurvy,
but you made me feel like I did.

10:42.851 --> 10:45.535
Well, that's high praise.

10:45.595 --> 10:47.479
That's...
that's very kind of you.

10:47.630 --> 10:49.130
-What's your name?
-Fiona.

10:49.191 --> 10:51.132
Well, it's lovely
to meet you, Fiona.

10:51.193 --> 10:53.042
Thank-thank you
for watching the show.

10:53.103 --> 10:55.469
You're... so nice.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.197
Could I?

10:59.109 --> 11:01.159
-Yeah. Of course. Of course.
-(laughs)

11:01.352 --> 11:02.994
(camera clicks)

11:03.905 --> 11:05.330
This is my lucky day.

11:05.523 --> 11:06.956
-Thank you.
-You bet.

11:08.952 --> 11:11.561
You are so happy right now.

11:11.621 --> 11:13.755
-No comments from you.
-(laughing)

11:21.297 --> 11:22.663
All right.

11:22.724 --> 11:24.665
I've got some good news
for you, Trinity.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.667
-Nothing's broken.
-TRINITY: Great.

11:26.728 --> 11:28.094
I don't need any more tests?

11:28.246 --> 11:29.503
Let's get out of here.

11:29.564 --> 11:33.007
(chuckles):
No. Get back in that bed.

11:33.068 --> 11:34.609
Trinity?

11:36.271 --> 11:38.071
Walk toward me.

11:39.983 --> 11:41.682
â™ª

11:41.743 --> 11:43.535
Your steps are uneven.

11:44.854 --> 11:46.779
Did you feel a little
off-balance when you fell?

11:46.873 --> 11:49.115
I mean, I wasn't
totally awake yet.

11:49.267 --> 11:50.709
I was tired.

11:50.860 --> 11:52.818
I feel like I've been tired
the whole... (grunts)

11:52.921 --> 11:54.954
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

11:55.090 --> 11:58.216
My heart's a little fluttery,
that's all. (groans)

11:58.385 --> 11:59.776
Heather.

11:59.836 --> 12:02.053
Need to get her on the monitor.

12:04.725 --> 12:07.058
Let's see what's going on.

12:07.251 --> 12:08.709
I'm fine.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.395
-I'm f...
-(monitor beeping rapidly)

12:10.588 --> 12:12.638
I knew it.
What's wrong with her?

12:12.733 --> 12:14.232
CONRAD:
Easy, easy, easy.

12:14.425 --> 12:16.383
(beeping stops)

12:16.445 --> 12:17.736
She just fainted.

12:17.887 --> 12:19.812
What happened?

12:19.906 --> 12:23.700
You just bought yourself some
more time in the hospital.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.086
Got a call I have a visitor.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.254
Hi again.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.256
â™ª â™ª

12:38.449 --> 12:39.924
-(chuckles)
-Um...

12:40.117 --> 12:42.318
Fiona? Right?

12:42.420 --> 12:44.912
I'm sorry to drop in
unannounced. I'll be quick.

12:44.931 --> 12:48.341
I'm actually curious
about employment at Chastain.

12:48.493 --> 12:50.493
-(chuckles)
-Uh, well... (stammers)

12:50.553 --> 12:51.844
I admire the gusto.

12:51.997 --> 12:53.513
Um, hiring is sort of...
(chuckles)

12:53.665 --> 12:55.665
-It's outside my purview.
-I know, it's just I'm...

12:55.725 --> 12:57.016
I'm trying to switch paths,

12:57.168 --> 12:58.610
so I'm looking
for something entry-level.

12:58.803 --> 13:00.278
And after seeing
the way that you

13:00.429 --> 13:03.114
talk about Chastain
on your show, and then...

13:03.307 --> 13:05.341
when I met you in person,

13:05.401 --> 13:08.119
I got all inspired.

13:08.312 --> 13:10.246
It felt like fate.

13:11.958 --> 13:15.018
Well, HR is on two, east wing.

13:15.119 --> 13:17.703
And you can tell them
Dr. Bell sent you.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.856
(chuckles):
Thank you so much.

13:19.916 --> 13:21.615
-You're amazing.
-Okay.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.052
Yes! (chuckles)

13:33.429 --> 13:35.038
Hey. So...

13:35.098 --> 13:37.816
I assume you've spoken to Mina.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.543
I talk to Mina all the time.

13:40.603 --> 13:42.987
So you know about the proposal?

13:44.032 --> 13:45.639
No.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.050
No, you-you did not propose.

13:47.068 --> 13:48.384
You've been dating
for, like, five seconds.

13:48.403 --> 13:49.569
Why would you jump the gun
like that?

13:49.721 --> 13:51.387
Mina Okafor proposed to me.

13:51.406 --> 13:54.724
Yeah, she needs a green card
so she doesn't get deported.

13:54.784 --> 13:57.043
-What?
-Yeah.

14:00.215 --> 14:02.323
(sighs) How can I help?

14:02.425 --> 14:03.733
Well...

14:03.793 --> 14:06.845
You can help plan a wedding.

14:07.038 --> 14:08.996
It has to happen quick,
so it can't be elaborate.

14:09.057 --> 14:12.333
You know, small guest list,
tasteful, intimate.

14:12.394 --> 14:13.701
Wait, so this is a real wedding?

14:13.728 --> 14:15.261
Well, under normal
circumstances,

14:15.355 --> 14:16.670
it'd be way too early.

14:16.731 --> 14:18.414
-Way.
-But...

14:18.433 --> 14:21.342
we will rise to the occasion.

14:22.253 --> 14:24.511
And just figure out
if you want to be married

14:24.531 --> 14:26.030
-while being married.
-(pager vibrating)

14:26.223 --> 14:27.514
Well, that's what
most people do anyway, right?

14:27.576 --> 14:28.608
They're just not honest
about it.

14:28.702 --> 14:30.368
All right. Oh.

14:30.519 --> 14:31.594
Duty calls.

14:31.654 --> 14:33.121
You are a doll.

14:35.491 --> 14:36.916
(Nic sighs)

14:40.997 --> 14:41.954
Nic?

14:42.048 --> 14:43.289
You okay?

14:43.425 --> 14:45.124
(inhales sharply)
Yeah.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.051
Are you okay?

14:47.203 --> 14:49.962
Yeah. Well, it turns out biking
at night is not a good idea,

14:50.056 --> 14:52.056
which is why I was
looking for you.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.783
Uh, I need a small favor.

14:53.843 --> 14:55.542
-Okay.
-So, I can't sleep.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.303
And I am exhausted.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.972
So I was taking meds to help,
but my doctor's out of town,

15:00.066 --> 15:01.882
so he can't refill the script.

15:01.943 --> 15:04.143
-Mm-hmm?
-So I just need

15:04.237 --> 15:06.613
something to sleep,
just enough for a couple days.

15:07.815 --> 15:09.014
I mean, Devon, we're friends.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.909
We don't have
a clinical relationship.

15:11.102 --> 15:13.912
I know, but if-if I don't sleep,
I'm not gonna be able to focus.

15:14.897 --> 15:16.563
And I'm not gonna ask Conrad,
'cause he's gonna worry

15:16.625 --> 15:17.749
for nothing.
My next day off,

15:17.918 --> 15:19.475
I'll go straight to the doctor.

15:20.569 --> 15:22.495
-Are you on
any other medication?
-No.

15:22.647 --> 15:25.089
-And this is just to get you
over the hump?
-Yes, this one time.

15:28.244 --> 15:30.762
All right, I'm sending this
to the pharmacy.

15:30.955 --> 15:33.656
Zolpidem, five milligrams.
I'm only giving you three pills.

15:33.758 --> 15:35.099
If you need more,
you go to your doctor.

15:35.292 --> 15:36.175
For sure.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.602
Thank you.

15:37.795 --> 15:40.438
(sighs)
Hey, are you sure you're okay?

15:40.631 --> 15:41.940
Yeah.

15:42.133 --> 15:43.816
Good.

15:46.488 --> 15:49.113
(sighs deeply)

15:49.306 --> 15:53.009
Trinity's arrhythmia broke
on its own.

15:53.069 --> 15:54.452
Her heart is
structurally normal.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.245
So why are these cardiac events
happening?

15:58.959 --> 16:00.792
This is a 19-year-old female

16:00.943 --> 16:03.294
with sporadic runs
of non-sustained V tach

16:03.487 --> 16:04.854
that are symptomatic.

16:04.914 --> 16:07.023
Echo is not impressive.

16:07.041 --> 16:07.815
Interesting.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.450
That is a wide-open box.

16:09.469 --> 16:10.860
-Any other history?
-Her mother reports

16:10.920 --> 16:12.953
difficulty with coordination.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.213
Otherwise healthy.

16:14.365 --> 16:16.123
All right, well,
keep her on telemetry.

16:16.226 --> 16:18.884
And grab me another EKG
now that she's in sinus.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.144
Will do.

16:27.270 --> 16:28.486
Come in.

16:28.679 --> 16:29.712
Sorry again.

16:29.772 --> 16:30.989
(chuckles)

16:31.157 --> 16:33.700
I left my rÃ©sumÃ©
with the lady in HR.

16:34.610 --> 16:36.477
Is there something else?

16:36.538 --> 16:38.538
I thought you'd want to see it.

16:39.949 --> 16:42.041
Okay.

16:44.028 --> 16:45.795
Thank you.

16:48.532 --> 16:50.717
â™ª

16:55.465 --> 16:58.165
This is not a rÃ©sumÃ©.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.243
-Let's call it my headshot.
-Oh, no, no.

17:00.303 --> 17:01.577
This is-- No, no.

17:01.637 --> 17:03.095
This is not your head.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.930
And-and this,
this is not appropriate.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.673
You know, I'm gonna ask you...

17:06.735 --> 17:08.084
-to leave.
-(beeps)

17:08.186 --> 17:10.920
-Don't pretend this isn't real.
-Just...

17:10.938 --> 17:12.271
-stand back. Kit.
-I know you want me.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.681
Kit. Dr. Voss. Could you
come in here for just...

17:14.743 --> 17:16.942
-just a moment?
-Yes, Randolph.

17:17.095 --> 17:18.369
I know you.

17:18.521 --> 17:20.854
-You're the girl
from this morning.
-Fiona.

17:20.915 --> 17:22.540
(quietly):
She's acting psychotic.

17:22.691 --> 17:24.784
And security's been notified.

17:24.878 --> 17:25.951
You called security?

17:26.046 --> 17:27.620
Well...
(stammers) because

17:27.756 --> 17:28.862
we are gonna get you some...

17:28.923 --> 17:30.548
We're gonna get you some help.

17:30.699 --> 17:32.291
(growling)

17:32.385 --> 17:34.777
(barking loudly)

17:34.796 --> 17:36.445
Stop her! Stop her!

17:36.464 --> 17:38.890
-Fiona. Fiona. Fiona.
-I need five of Haldol for IM.

17:39.041 --> 17:41.467
Look at me. Look at me.
We're gonna get you some help.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.135
We'll take a little trip
down to the ER.

17:43.288 --> 17:44.453
I'll be there with you
the whole time.

17:44.514 --> 17:47.714
(growling, grunting)

17:47.817 --> 17:49.716
KIT:
There you go.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.885
There you go, darling.

17:51.946 --> 17:54.555
Just give it a minute.
You'll be okay.

17:54.616 --> 17:56.199
(panting)

17:59.436 --> 18:00.870
Nice work.

18:05.794 --> 18:08.795
-(phone rings)
-(exhales)

18:09.589 --> 18:11.163
Hey, Mom.

18:12.650 --> 18:14.759
Can you pick up laundry
detergent on your way home?

18:14.952 --> 18:16.761
-I had plenty.
<i> -Now you have none,</i>

18:16.954 --> 18:18.078
<i> but you have clean clothes</i>

18:18.139 --> 18:19.338
and linens.

18:19.474 --> 18:20.932
<i> You didn't have to do that.</i>

18:21.125 --> 18:22.100
(sighs)

18:22.293 --> 18:24.602
Your home is lonely.

18:24.795 --> 18:26.270
You are lonely.

18:26.463 --> 18:27.513
You need a partner.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.107
No. No, I don't.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.016
No, don't-don't do that.

18:31.111 --> 18:32.518
Check your phone.

18:32.670 --> 18:34.112
Don't forget the detergent.

18:34.305 --> 18:35.488
Love you.

18:36.357 --> 18:37.573
(phone chimes)

18:39.402 --> 18:41.202
(scoffs)

18:45.741 --> 18:47.683
(quietly):
Are you getting deported?

18:47.785 --> 18:49.685
I will kill AJ Austin.

18:49.787 --> 18:52.855
(scoffs)
You can't marry a corpse, Mina.

18:52.874 --> 18:54.690
(sighs)
Why didn't you tell me?

18:54.750 --> 18:57.117
Uh, because saying it
makes it real.

18:57.137 --> 19:00.621
Not saying it
doesn't change that.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.214
I didn't want you to get upset.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.367
All right?
It's not an ideal situation,

19:04.427 --> 19:05.718
but AJ and I are handling it.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.370
We'll do it quickly.

19:07.430 --> 19:09.054
And I'll be safe
from deportation.

19:09.207 --> 19:11.149
"Quickly"? He wants a wedding.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.875
This is real to him.

19:12.894 --> 19:14.210
Of course it's real.

19:14.270 --> 19:16.136
Sort of real.

19:16.197 --> 19:18.531
It's also business.

19:20.109 --> 19:23.052
A real marriage
and a business arrangement

19:23.154 --> 19:24.478
are two separate things.

19:24.539 --> 19:26.164
-I mean, it can't be both.
-Why not?

19:26.315 --> 19:28.482
By definition, a marriage is
a business arrangement.

19:28.543 --> 19:31.485
You are linking your finances,
your housing arrangement,

19:31.588 --> 19:33.820
your professional
and biological plans

19:33.840 --> 19:35.155
to someone else.
It makes sense.

19:35.216 --> 19:37.925
It makes sense
if you're in love.

19:39.387 --> 19:41.721
Are you in love with him?

19:45.927 --> 19:47.259
Okay.

19:47.353 --> 19:50.262
The reason I didn't want you
to get upset

19:50.415 --> 19:54.192
is because I think
you also have a secret.

19:54.343 --> 19:56.843
Yesterday, you took a power nap
in the nurses' lounge.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.196
You have developed
the superpower

19:58.347 --> 20:00.423
-to smell doughnuts a hall away.
-(sighs)

20:00.524 --> 20:02.091
Your hair is extra lustrous.

20:02.151 --> 20:05.185
And some might say
you're glowing.

20:05.246 --> 20:06.913
(chuckles softly)

20:09.325 --> 20:11.116
-Okay, it's early.
-Mm-hmm.

20:11.269 --> 20:14.212
-I'm not ready to talk about it.
-Okay.

20:14.363 --> 20:15.621
I will keep your secret.

20:15.757 --> 20:17.122
Please keep mine.

20:17.258 --> 20:19.050
For now.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.552
And congratulations.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.949
(footsteps approaching)

20:26.968 --> 20:30.210
Your girl here is
a missing person.

20:31.289 --> 20:33.397
I called her house
and talked to her roommate.

20:33.590 --> 20:36.308
Two days ago, she left for
groceries and never came home.

20:36.402 --> 20:39.645
Pravesh said
her head CT came back normal.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.313
No drugs in her system.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.557
Did the roommate say anything
about a history

20:43.576 --> 20:45.150
-of mental illness?
-I asked.

20:45.245 --> 20:46.577
None that she knew of.

20:46.770 --> 20:47.745
She's trying to get in touch
with her family

20:47.896 --> 20:48.988
on the West Coast.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.957
Then maybe this is
a new diagnosis.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.325
-It might be
her first psychotic break.
-Mm.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.628
She's in the right age range.

20:59.250 --> 21:01.333
Can't treat her
till we find out what it is.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.411
Well, Dr. Pravesh is on his way
to do a full exam.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.556
-I'll keep you posted.
-Okay. Thank you.

21:10.386 --> 21:12.770
Lots of people faint.

21:12.963 --> 21:14.847
True. But you fainted

21:14.941 --> 21:17.257
because your heart
was beating abnormally.

21:17.277 --> 21:18.684
We need to find out why.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.278
We ordered a few more lab tests,
okay, Trinity?

21:20.429 --> 21:23.355
Mmm. Your coffee smells
like heaven.

21:23.491 --> 21:25.616
-Is that hazelnut?
-Yeah.

21:25.809 --> 21:27.285
-I'm gonna go get us some, Trin.
-That's weird.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.436
I can't smell it.

21:30.647 --> 21:33.349
What do you mean
you can't smell it?

21:33.409 --> 21:34.683
(sniffs)
What about this?

21:34.744 --> 21:36.252
My perfume?

21:37.580 --> 21:38.687
She can't have COVID, can she?

21:38.748 --> 21:40.781
Let's all just take a breath.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.966
Loss of smell can be a symptom
of multiple things.

21:42.159 --> 21:43.617
No, no, no, no.
We were so careful.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.786
We-we-we got
all our groceries delivered.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.139
-We didn't see friends. We...
-It could be allergies
or a cold.

21:48.308 --> 21:49.974
Even when we joined a pod
and we tested positive,

21:50.167 --> 21:52.793
we-we-we were lucky because
we didn't have any symptoms.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.812
-Okay. Good, good.
-(breathing heavily)

21:55.005 --> 21:56.388
The danger's supposed
to be over.

21:56.524 --> 21:58.799
It's supposed to be... safe.
(mumbles)

21:58.860 --> 22:01.635
-Whoa.
-Mom.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.546
-Whoa. Gotcha, gotcha.
-Mom!

22:03.606 --> 22:05.323
â™ª â™ª

22:05.516 --> 22:06.824
Mom...

22:07.017 --> 22:08.993
-are you okay?
-Your mom's stable.

22:09.186 --> 22:11.720
They're just taking a look at
her heart with an ultrasound.

22:11.781 --> 22:14.223
MINA: Akinesis
of the postero-basal wall.

22:14.283 --> 22:15.482
Circumflex infarct.

22:15.585 --> 22:18.485
That explains
the non-diagnostic EKG.

22:18.588 --> 22:21.154
Is that bad? It sounds bad.

22:21.257 --> 22:22.823
Your mom collapsed because she's

22:22.925 --> 22:24.825
actually having
a heart attack right now.

22:24.886 --> 22:26.660
Oh, my God.
How is that possible?

22:26.721 --> 22:28.587
Her EKG shows evidence

22:28.723 --> 22:30.573
of another heart attack
in the past.

22:30.591 --> 22:32.892
Has your mom ever had chest pain
or shortness of breath before?

22:36.522 --> 22:38.022
The protests.

22:38.173 --> 22:39.673
When George Floyd was murdered.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.266
We made our signs
and we went out there.

22:41.361 --> 22:43.752
It was supposed to be peaceful,
but it didn't matter.

22:43.813 --> 22:46.346
They tear gassed us all.

22:46.366 --> 22:48.366
That must've been awful.

22:49.744 --> 22:52.352
I recovered pretty quickly,
but Mom said

22:52.413 --> 22:55.447
she felt like an elephant
was sitting on her chest.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.282
I wanted to take her
to the hospital,

22:57.418 --> 22:59.952
but she was afraid we were
gonna catch COVID again.

23:00.046 --> 23:03.288
Back then, we didn't know
if that was possible.

23:03.383 --> 23:05.383
She was afraid.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.534
Okay, that could be it.

23:07.595 --> 23:09.111
Tear gas can cause stress

23:09.171 --> 23:12.056
on the heart
and aggravate cardiac issues.

23:12.225 --> 23:15.375
Your mom has
a good chance of recovery.

23:15.395 --> 23:17.286
We need to get her
to a cath lab now.

23:17.346 --> 23:19.471
We'll put a stent in to open up
the clogged arteries

23:19.565 --> 23:20.789
-in her heart.
-Don't worry.

23:20.850 --> 23:23.067
It's a routine procedure, okay?

23:24.112 --> 23:25.477
Mom?

23:25.571 --> 23:27.405
I love you.

23:27.556 --> 23:30.765
I love you, too, baby girl.

23:30.785 --> 23:34.153
I'll be right back to cosign
for that apartment.

23:34.247 --> 23:36.622
Okay.

23:41.421 --> 23:43.087
â™ª

23:51.931 --> 23:54.339
AUSTIN:
Okay, you got to get it
closer to the vessel wall

23:54.492 --> 23:55.933
before you deploy.

23:56.126 --> 23:58.327
I'm trying to rotate it,
but I can't get the stent

23:58.387 --> 24:02.589
-into position.
-Well, see, it's a tight spot.

24:02.650 --> 24:03.999
(monitor beeping)

24:04.059 --> 24:06.610
No blood flow. She's in V tach!

24:06.803 --> 24:09.354
Charge the defib to 200.

24:09.507 --> 24:11.023
Any sign of trauma?

24:11.175 --> 24:12.616
Not yet.

24:12.768 --> 24:15.619
There's no bruising,
no breaks in the skin at all.

24:15.812 --> 24:17.437
It looks like Fiona works
as a paralegal

24:17.457 --> 24:19.348
while in law school.

24:19.408 --> 24:21.200
No edema. No rashes.

24:21.352 --> 24:24.369
She posts pictures of her food
and her feet in sandals.

24:24.464 --> 24:26.872
No clues there.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.541
BELL:
Uh, hold on.

24:29.694 --> 24:31.543
There's bruising
on her lower flank.

24:31.637 --> 24:33.362
Grey Turner's sign?

24:33.422 --> 24:35.531
Wait, wait. Feel this.

24:35.591 --> 24:37.057
You're right.

24:38.260 --> 24:40.369
There's a mass.

24:40.429 --> 24:42.605
Let's take a look.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.709
BELL:
It's right there.

24:46.727 --> 24:48.486
It's a tumor
right above her kidney.

24:48.654 --> 24:50.488
Extending deep
towards her spine.

24:50.639 --> 24:53.048
How long has she been walking
around with that in her?

24:53.108 --> 24:56.051
If this is an adrenal tumor
secreting hormones,

24:56.111 --> 24:58.403
it could be causing
her psychosis.

24:58.556 --> 25:01.582
Certainly could explain her
interest in the famous Dr. Bell.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.711
Zoom in.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.655
There-- active extravasation.

25:08.674 --> 25:10.399
She's got
a retroperitoneal bleed.

25:10.417 --> 25:11.842
Could've happened when she
was fighting with security.

25:12.035 --> 25:13.326
Well, if we don't
get it out soon,

25:13.387 --> 25:14.345
she's just gonna bleed out.

25:14.538 --> 25:15.888
I'll get an OR ready.

25:19.519 --> 25:21.519
CONRAD:
I gave the lab a heads-up

25:21.712 --> 25:24.230
about putting a rush
on Trinity's bloodwork.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.100
Nope. It's not my business.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.252
-You do you.
-It's not a dating app.

25:30.354 --> 25:32.029
It's my mom.

25:32.180 --> 25:35.199
It's the tenth eligible woman
she's sent me today.

25:35.350 --> 25:37.350
You getting enough sleep?

25:37.411 --> 25:39.036
Oh, you're talking to Nic?

25:39.187 --> 25:42.598
No, but... if she
noticed you look tired,

25:42.658 --> 25:44.283
it's because you do.

25:44.377 --> 25:47.603
Yeah, I'm tired.

25:47.621 --> 25:49.529
But I'm handling it.

25:49.590 --> 25:50.956
I get it. I've been there.

25:51.092 --> 25:53.442
So much of what we fight against
is preventable.

25:53.502 --> 25:55.127
It's like...

25:55.263 --> 25:57.203
why am I drowning in debt

25:57.265 --> 25:58.964
for this?

25:59.058 --> 26:01.767
It's exhausting.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.728
I don't know
how many different ways

26:04.880 --> 26:06.397
-I can tell you that I'm fine.
-You don't have

26:06.590 --> 26:08.140
to talk to me-- I'll give you
a name, someone good.

26:08.292 --> 26:10.309
But I'm not looking
to talk to anyone.

26:10.403 --> 26:12.611
Drop it.

26:14.574 --> 26:15.990
(knocking on door)

26:18.578 --> 26:21.078
-Hi.
-How's my mom?

26:21.271 --> 26:22.580
Is she okay?

26:22.773 --> 26:24.473
Dr. Austin and Dr. Okafor

26:24.491 --> 26:26.083
are still with her
in the cath lab.

26:28.754 --> 26:30.495
While we're waiting,

26:30.590 --> 26:33.482
we want to run
a couple other tests on you.

26:33.500 --> 26:34.833
I bet your mom would feel better

26:34.927 --> 26:36.985
if we had some answers
when she came out.

26:37.004 --> 26:38.596
Put your hands up like this.

26:39.456 --> 26:40.931
Okay.

26:43.460 --> 26:45.769
This is my fault, isn't it?

26:46.814 --> 26:49.148
I pushed back about everything.

26:50.276 --> 26:53.777
I argued with her all last year.

26:53.970 --> 26:55.687
I'm why she was so stressed.

26:55.781 --> 26:57.189
No. No, you didn't do this.

26:57.341 --> 27:00.909
This past year was stressful
for everyone.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.695
CONRAD:
You can't blame yourself

27:03.789 --> 27:06.624
for circumstances
that are out of your control.

27:09.186 --> 27:12.187
That was a near miss
with that stent deployment.

27:12.289 --> 27:14.039
Fine job back there.

27:14.191 --> 27:15.874
-We do make a good team.
-(laughs)

27:15.968 --> 27:18.552
That we do.

27:19.588 --> 27:22.139
I have bad news.

27:22.290 --> 27:24.032
I spoke
to an immigration lawyer.

27:24.093 --> 27:26.810
If we get married,
it could raise red flags.

27:27.003 --> 27:28.646
Why?

27:28.839 --> 27:30.481
We've known each other
for years.

27:30.632 --> 27:32.816
It's easy to prove we have
a basis for a real marriage.

27:33.009 --> 27:34.652
But this version of us is new.

27:34.803 --> 27:37.546
We don't have photos or records
of vacations together.

27:37.606 --> 27:39.823
The government
will ask "Why now?"

27:40.016 --> 27:41.383
They can ask
all the questions they want.

27:41.443 --> 27:42.809
We got nothing to hide.

27:42.828 --> 27:44.144
The lawyer said
the presumption will be

27:44.163 --> 27:47.072
that our marriage
is not bona fide.

27:47.224 --> 27:49.224
If there is an investigation
and it goes badly,

27:49.284 --> 27:52.836
I'll get deported and not
allowed back in the country.

27:53.029 --> 27:54.821
Not allowed back in the country?

27:54.840 --> 27:56.322
You could face
felony charges for perjury.

27:56.425 --> 27:58.233
Not if I don't perjure myself.

27:58.293 --> 28:01.161
Mina, if we end up in court,
I will tell them the truth.

28:01.222 --> 28:02.888
The marriage is real.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.760
Unless you're saying
you don't think it'll be real.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.854
Okay, AJ, you're not hearing me.

28:11.006 --> 28:12.915
If we get married
right after my visa denial,

28:12.975 --> 28:16.176
no matter what we say or do,
I can still get deported.

28:16.237 --> 28:18.904
It's putting us both at risk
and I refuse to do that.

28:20.866 --> 28:23.867
-So you're saying
the wedding is off.
-I am.

28:25.079 --> 28:27.446
We've got to deal
with this bigger problem first.

28:27.598 --> 28:30.958
You can't marry or even date
someone who isn't here.

28:45.174 --> 28:46.372
Ah.

28:46.434 --> 28:48.541
Murgh makhani, bharta,

28:48.602 --> 28:52.637
coconut barfi,
all of your favorites.

28:52.732 --> 28:54.623
Mom, the hospital
has a cafeteria.

28:54.683 --> 28:56.400
Well, now you don't
have to go there.

28:56.593 --> 28:58.885
Or come home to filth.

28:58.988 --> 29:00.979
Your room was
particularly a disaster.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.982
-I discarded these things.
-Okay, stop.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.743
Okay?

29:05.936 --> 29:08.412
Did you like any of the pictures
that I sent you?

29:08.605 --> 29:09.913
Hmm?

29:11.459 --> 29:13.992
Listen, I am not there
right now.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.569
Dating is not exactly
on my radar, okay?

29:16.630 --> 29:18.163
Let-Let's go.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.590
I thought we could eat together.

29:19.759 --> 29:22.259
God, you cannot
just show up at my job

29:22.452 --> 29:24.669
and expect me to drop everything
and go eat barfi with you.

29:24.822 --> 29:26.079
You need to listen.

29:26.098 --> 29:29.099
I-I eat cafeteria food,
I have women over

29:29.251 --> 29:30.993
who might not be Indian,
and that is my choice.

29:31.053 --> 29:34.146
I don't want any of this.
I don't need it.

29:35.966 --> 29:38.567
You should have asked
before coming here.

29:39.803 --> 29:42.196
We both miss your father.

29:43.949 --> 29:46.241
I thought we could
help each other.

29:48.788 --> 29:50.937
Well, you should have
called first.

29:51.982 --> 29:55.033
My calls go
straight to voice mail.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.795
And when you do answer,
it's always,

29:57.946 --> 30:00.923
"I only have a minute,"
or "I have to get back."

30:02.918 --> 30:06.762
I didn't ask if I could visit
because I knew you'd say no.

30:12.645 --> 30:15.103
(exhales)

30:16.339 --> 30:18.982
Two minutes in the microwave.

30:23.847 --> 30:29.309
Well, the famous Sidney Vicious
won't be lonely tonight.

30:29.370 --> 30:31.219
We should be able
to get you out of here soon.

30:31.280 --> 30:36.391
You have a rare genetic
disease called Refsum syndrome.

30:36.451 --> 30:38.560
-Does my mom have it, too?
-No.

30:38.579 --> 30:40.896
She's a carrier of the mutation,
but to get the disease,

30:40.956 --> 30:43.081
you have to have
two genetic defects.

30:43.233 --> 30:46.659
Basically, y-your body
isn't able to process

30:46.679 --> 30:48.178
a certain type of fat.

30:48.330 --> 30:50.906
Over time, that causes toxicity
to multiple organs.

30:50.966 --> 30:52.407
That's why you were falling.

30:52.467 --> 30:55.168
And it's why your heart
was giving you trouble.

30:55.187 --> 30:56.928
Here's the good news:
it's totally manageable.

30:57.022 --> 30:59.839
We caught it early,
which is fantastic.

30:59.900 --> 31:02.250
And my buddy Dr. Pravesh and I,
we think changes

31:02.311 --> 31:03.768
in your diet are gonna
do the trick.

31:03.863 --> 31:07.105
So we'll hook you up
with a nutritionist,

31:07.257 --> 31:08.848
and we'll schedule
regular appointments

31:08.909 --> 31:10.742
to keep an eye on everything.

31:12.955 --> 31:16.582
I acted like everything was fine
because I wanted it to be.

31:18.252 --> 31:20.360
You wanted life to be normal.
We all do.

31:20.421 --> 31:24.882
Yeah, but Mom knew something
was wrong with me.

31:25.885 --> 31:27.776
Yeah, well,
sometimes our parents

31:27.794 --> 31:29.778
see things that we don't see
in ourselves.

31:29.838 --> 31:33.281
I stomped around like
the world was happening to me.

31:33.342 --> 31:35.800
While she was the one who
actually had something wrong.

31:35.953 --> 31:37.377
CONRAD:
Eh, don't take that on.

31:37.396 --> 31:40.138
You and your mom,
you got through the impossible.

31:40.290 --> 31:42.882
Cut yourself a break.
Celebrate it.

31:42.985 --> 31:45.736
I've been so annoyed with my mom
this whole time,

31:45.929 --> 31:50.723
but now it's like...
I just want her to be okay.

31:50.784 --> 31:52.558
-I need her.
-(phone vibrating)

31:52.620 --> 31:55.621
I'm pretty sure
she needs you, too.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.792
It's Nic.

32:01.587 --> 32:04.046
Go.

32:09.762 --> 32:11.836
CONRAD:
Oh, wow.

32:11.931 --> 32:15.748
Doesn't matter how many times
I've seen one of these.

32:15.809 --> 32:19.102
It's different when it's ours.

32:19.295 --> 32:20.679
It's magical.

32:20.831 --> 32:22.606
Oh, look. That's the heartbeat.

32:22.799 --> 32:25.000
(both laugh)

32:25.018 --> 32:27.836
-Ah. Looks like a fighter.
-GABBI: I agree.

32:27.896 --> 32:30.781
Growing just like it should be.
That is a perfect baby.

32:30.974 --> 32:33.617
(exhales):
This is good.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.745
I love you.

32:37.647 --> 32:39.364
I love you, too.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.083
(exhales)

32:42.294 --> 32:43.627
Want to know what you're having?

32:43.820 --> 32:45.921
-(laughs)
-Uh...

32:48.801 --> 32:50.884
TRINITY:
Mom?

32:51.920 --> 32:53.786
Mom?

32:53.889 --> 32:55.806
I'm right here, Mama.

32:58.334 --> 32:59.851
Hi, baby.

33:01.004 --> 33:03.463
The doctors fixed your heart.

33:03.524 --> 33:06.708
We managed to place a stent
in your blocked artery.

33:06.768 --> 33:08.652
You get to go home
in a couple of days.

33:10.047 --> 33:12.138
Well, we didn't make it
to your apartment.

33:12.199 --> 33:13.306
It's okay.

33:13.367 --> 33:14.883
I'm not moving out anymore.

33:14.943 --> 33:16.976
I'm gonna stay home with you.

33:17.037 --> 33:19.162
The hell you are.

33:20.356 --> 33:25.227
You think I helped those wings
grow strong just to clip them?

33:25.287 --> 33:27.320
You're ready to fly.

33:27.381 --> 33:30.415
But what if you need me?

33:30.567 --> 33:32.217
Then I'll call you.

33:35.723 --> 33:36.996
BELL:
Pickups to me.

33:37.057 --> 33:38.831
KIT:
These buggers are everywhere.

33:38.851 --> 33:40.517
BELL:
Well, we're making
good progress.

33:40.668 --> 33:42.835
Last time with one of these
tumors, it took hours to ligate

33:42.855 --> 33:44.021
all vessels.

33:44.172 --> 33:45.522
KIT:
I think we're lucky she's young,

33:45.715 --> 33:47.249
and we caught this
while it was still small.

33:47.350 --> 33:49.008
BELL:
Metz?

33:49.903 --> 33:53.179
KIT:
I see why you don't want
to be CEO.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.923
You're a wizard in the OR.

33:54.941 --> 33:57.425
Still, Chastain needs you.

33:57.486 --> 33:59.685
It's about quality of life, Kit.

33:59.747 --> 34:02.021
That's why you should do it.

34:02.082 --> 34:06.526
As CEO, you can hire
anyone you want.

34:06.628 --> 34:08.620
-(scoffs)
-Remind me, Randolph.

34:08.756 --> 34:11.623
What are the
"Cs of medical cash flow"?

34:11.775 --> 34:13.699
-I'm not doing that.
-I'll start.

34:13.761 --> 34:16.795
Chemo, cataracts, colonoscopies.
Come on, give me one.

34:16.889 --> 34:19.631
-Cancer.
-Already covered
when I said "chemo." Try again.

34:19.725 --> 34:21.466
Cosmetic surgery.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.226
There you go.

34:23.378 --> 34:27.731
You could gain financial ground
by hiring a rock star

34:27.882 --> 34:29.474
-plastic surgeon.
-(scoffs)

34:29.568 --> 34:31.359
Like your stepson Jake.

34:32.279 --> 34:34.237
-Cauterize.
-I am.

34:34.430 --> 34:36.406
Trust me, the kid doesn't want
to be anywhere near me,

34:36.558 --> 34:38.149
much less work under me.

34:38.243 --> 34:42.871
Maybe you could sweeten the deal
if you took Yorn's offer.

34:49.296 --> 34:52.238
Did I...
did I give you a picture?

34:52.257 --> 34:54.907
Don't worry. It went straight
in the shredder.

34:54.968 --> 34:57.260
Never mind. I don't want
to remember anything else.

34:57.453 --> 34:58.762
No, it's not your fault.

34:58.955 --> 35:00.822
You had a very rare type
of tumor

35:00.841 --> 35:02.099
that secreted hormones,

35:02.292 --> 35:04.676
and it caused your behavior
to change.

35:04.828 --> 35:06.845
-What happens now?
-KIT: We have to wait

35:06.939 --> 35:09.755
for pathology results
to stage it appropriately,

35:09.866 --> 35:11.608
but we have some
of the finest oncologists

35:11.801 --> 35:13.685
here who will help
with the next steps.

35:13.837 --> 35:15.854
BELL:
And we can already see
your mental status is improving.

35:15.948 --> 35:18.448
Try not to be embarrassed.

35:18.641 --> 35:20.024
If you hadn't followed
Dr. Bell here,

35:20.119 --> 35:21.952
who knows when
you would've been diagnosed.

35:22.145 --> 35:26.014
-Okay. But still, Dr. Bell.
-Mm.

35:26.032 --> 35:28.199
You're like four decades
too old for me.

35:28.293 --> 35:30.518
I don't think four is right.

35:30.620 --> 35:32.712
You're like my grandpa.

35:34.782 --> 35:35.948
Or father.

35:36.009 --> 35:37.950
KIT:
It's fortunate we caught it

35:37.970 --> 35:41.529
-when we did. Get some rest.
-(Bell clears throat)

35:41.590 --> 35:43.223
Let's go, Gramps.

35:45.018 --> 35:47.060
Thanks.

35:50.524 --> 35:52.465
Hey, Nic.

35:52.526 --> 35:54.609
-Hey.
-Um...

35:55.821 --> 35:57.545
I'm giving these back to you.

35:57.564 --> 36:01.307
And, um, I shouldn't have
put you in that weird position.

36:01.368 --> 36:03.218
I'm sorry.

36:03.278 --> 36:05.387
It did feel strange

36:05.488 --> 36:07.330
giving them to you.

36:07.523 --> 36:09.958
Um, but are you okay?

36:12.362 --> 36:13.503
Everyone keeps asking me that.

36:13.696 --> 36:15.154
I guess I need to figure it out.

36:15.257 --> 36:17.841
Yeah, figuring it out will help.

36:18.034 --> 36:21.994
And you know I'm here
if you need anything, right?

36:22.055 --> 36:23.829
Yeah.

36:23.891 --> 36:26.725
-Thanks again.
-Mm.

36:29.396 --> 36:30.854
What's all that about?

36:31.005 --> 36:32.838
Well, I was just
texting everybody.

36:32.900 --> 36:35.525
-Check your phone.
-(phone vibrates)

36:39.740 --> 36:41.180
<i> DEVON:</i>
<i> I was with Nic</i>

36:41.241 --> 36:43.274
when she sent that text.
She didn't say why.

36:43.427 --> 36:45.685
-Do you know why we're here?
-We'll find out soon enough.

36:45.746 --> 36:47.929
I'm guessing a baby.
They just got married.

36:47.948 --> 36:50.749
-It's got to be a baby.
-Shh. Don't jinx it.

36:52.494 --> 36:54.269
We wanted you
to be the first to know.

36:54.329 --> 36:57.121
-You're having a baby?
-Don't jinx it.

36:57.257 --> 37:00.291
-(laughs)
-Guess it was obvious.
-Oh!

37:00.444 --> 37:02.368
-Fantastic news.
-Yeah, I'll have that now.

37:02.429 --> 37:04.036
Here you go. Here you go.

37:04.056 --> 37:06.372
-You want to do the honors?
-Thank you.

37:06.433 --> 37:08.207
It's a girl.

37:08.268 --> 37:09.801
(cheering)

37:09.895 --> 37:11.970
You didn't waste any time there.

37:12.064 --> 37:13.471
(laughter)

37:13.565 --> 37:15.974
Yay! Congrats!

37:16.068 --> 37:18.235
Cheers. Cheers.

37:18.428 --> 37:19.827
DEVON:
All right.

37:19.854 --> 37:22.722
â™ª<i> Reason.</i> â™ª

37:22.824 --> 37:25.075
(food sizzling)

37:31.959 --> 37:33.416
(sniffing)

37:33.585 --> 37:35.752
(door closes)

37:40.926 --> 37:42.817
Hey, Mom.

37:43.786 --> 37:47.246
I wanted to see for myself
that you are okay.

37:47.307 --> 37:51.175
And now that I have,
I will be on a plane tomorrow.

37:51.270 --> 37:53.770
(sighs)
No.

37:53.963 --> 37:57.423
Mom, I'm...
I'm sorry I lied to you.

37:58.610 --> 38:01.945
I didn't get this
from an ER patient.

38:02.138 --> 38:03.855
I told my friends at work that

38:03.991 --> 38:06.950
I got in a bike accident,
and that was a lie, too.

38:07.143 --> 38:09.602
(sighs)

38:09.621 --> 38:12.122
Last night, I went to a bar,

38:12.315 --> 38:15.292
and there was this guy,
six foot five, huge arms,

38:15.485 --> 38:17.794
minding his own business.

38:17.987 --> 38:21.372
I just got in a fight with him.

38:21.525 --> 38:23.041
Oh, Devon.

38:23.135 --> 38:26.361
Mom, that's not even
the first dumb thing I've done.

38:26.421 --> 38:28.696
I just...

38:28.757 --> 38:31.032
keep thinking about Dad,

38:31.092 --> 38:33.793
you know, and...

38:33.812 --> 38:36.962
what I could have done
different.

38:37.024 --> 38:39.482
You know?

38:39.675 --> 38:41.901
You cannot blame yourself.

38:43.605 --> 38:45.897
If I...

38:45.991 --> 38:48.808
just moved him
to a different hospital,

38:48.869 --> 38:52.887
or spoke
to his doctors more often...

38:52.947 --> 38:55.665
If I had made him
stop driving that taxi.

38:55.858 --> 38:58.084
No, Mom. That was his choice.

38:59.921 --> 39:02.255
And then, the system failed him.

39:04.534 --> 39:06.718
And it failed us.

39:10.665 --> 39:12.498
Listen, that isn't your fault.

39:12.559 --> 39:15.668
Well, it's not yours, either.

39:15.729 --> 39:17.503
(sniffles)

39:17.564 --> 39:20.765
No, his death was out
of our control.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.734
(exhales):
Yeah.

39:23.853 --> 39:26.104
We need each other.

39:26.198 --> 39:29.014
Okay?

39:29.076 --> 39:31.117
Please stay.

39:33.121 --> 39:35.613
(sighs)

39:35.765 --> 39:39.283
(sniffles)
I will. I will.

39:39.419 --> 39:40.618
Mm.

39:40.712 --> 39:43.438
(sniffles)

39:43.498 --> 39:44.939
(sighs)

39:44.999 --> 39:47.442
Someone has to help you eat

39:47.460 --> 39:50.035
all of this food.

39:50.097 --> 39:51.796
(laughs)

39:51.948 --> 39:53.131
(sniffles)

39:53.225 --> 39:55.058
You could always make
a nice dinner

39:55.227 --> 39:58.136
for one of the lovely women in
the pictures that I sent you.

39:58.230 --> 40:02.023
Oh, my... You don't quit.

40:05.094 --> 40:07.112
AJ?

40:11.618 --> 40:13.576
Well, if you came here
to wish me good luck,

40:13.728 --> 40:15.153
I'm offended.

40:15.247 --> 40:19.157
I can do an inguinal
hernia repair in my sleep.

40:19.251 --> 40:20.750
I'm not here for luck.

40:20.919 --> 40:24.421
I need to tell you something.

40:24.614 --> 40:26.572
I'm listening.

40:26.633 --> 40:29.408
I don't often apologize,

40:29.469 --> 40:31.577
because I rarely make mistakes,

40:31.638 --> 40:34.431
but today, I made one.

40:34.624 --> 40:38.009
I shouldn't have
proposed to you like that

40:38.103 --> 40:40.995
without doing
the proper research.

40:41.014 --> 40:43.231
You had every right to be upset.

40:44.834 --> 40:47.444
You were in a tough spot.

40:47.637 --> 40:49.520
You still are.

40:49.673 --> 40:54.358
I asked you the impossible and
you agreed without hesitation.

40:54.453 --> 40:56.744
I'm grateful for that.

40:57.456 --> 40:59.080
Okay.

41:02.461 --> 41:06.212
Nic asked me
if I'm in love with you.

41:07.624 --> 41:09.949
I didn't know
what to say then, but...

41:10.051 --> 41:12.469
now I do.

41:15.557 --> 41:17.557
It's yes.

41:19.260 --> 41:23.229
I am... in love with you.

41:29.988 --> 41:31.845
(laughing)

41:33.325 --> 41:38.720
So the end of today's
roller coaster ride is here.

41:38.738 --> 41:41.647
And what a beautiful ending
it is.

41:41.750 --> 41:42.999
Except, I may still be deported.

41:43.192 --> 41:45.668
No. No, no,
that's not gonna happen.

41:45.861 --> 41:49.923
We are not gonna
let that happen, guaranteed.

41:52.052 --> 41:54.569
You know I love you, too, right?

41:54.587 --> 41:57.472
I suspected so.

42:01.228 --> 42:03.761
What'd I tell you? Huh?
Magnificent lobby.

42:03.913 --> 42:06.247
-I think it would fall
right in line with what...
-Jacob.

42:06.349 --> 42:08.674
Your, uh, office

42:08.735 --> 42:10.918
was my next stop
after I finished this tour.

42:10.937 --> 42:12.587
Well, uh,

42:12.605 --> 42:14.255
pardon the interruption.
Do you mind if I just steal him

42:14.357 --> 42:16.241
for just a moment?

42:20.080 --> 42:22.539
I've decided to accept
Red Rock's generous offer.

42:22.732 --> 42:24.023
I'm confident, as CEO,

42:24.084 --> 42:25.950
I can turn
our financial situation around.

42:26.086 --> 42:28.119
And I have
some initial thoughts about...

42:28.255 --> 42:29.620
Since last we spoke,
Red Rock has had

42:29.756 --> 42:31.622
to make
some very difficult decisions.

42:31.775 --> 42:35.468
So that CEO spot--
no longer open.

42:37.764 --> 42:39.797
Who are you filling it with?

42:39.949 --> 42:43.117
No one. We sold Chastain.

42:43.219 --> 42:46.804
Well, um, I'll be happy to work
with the new conglomerate

42:46.898 --> 42:48.565
-in any way...
-Look around. Look around.

42:48.716 --> 42:50.883
We are standing on
a prime piece of real estate.

42:50.986 --> 42:53.886
These buyers are developers.

42:53.947 --> 42:55.630
Yeah.

42:55.690 --> 42:59.033
They're turning Chastain
into luxury condos.

43:02.581 --> 43:04.063
My apologies.

43:04.082 --> 43:05.823
Why don't we walk over
to the elevators here.

43:05.917 --> 43:08.418
I want you guys to get that
magnificent view from up top.
