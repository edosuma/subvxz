00:01.485 --> 00:04.244
<i> -Previously on</i> The Resident...
-I saw Yorn.

00:04.396 --> 00:06.230
-Did he say why
he hasn't hired a CEO?
-They're selling the hospital.

00:06.290 --> 00:07.989
-Oh.
-I need to show Yorn
that Chastain

00:08.050 --> 00:09.550
is worth a hell of a lot more
than he thinks it is.

00:11.628 --> 00:12.919
My father, when he died,

00:13.072 --> 00:14.662
I didn't even get
to say goodbye.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.999
<i> What I would do for just</i>
<i> one more day with my dad.</i>

00:18.060 --> 00:20.777
Sorry. Losing someone
is never easy.

00:20.779 --> 00:22.170
I'll get someone
to cover for you.

00:22.231 --> 00:23.930
No.

00:24.025 --> 00:27.175
I'm okay. I just need a minute.

00:27.236 --> 00:30.512
(takes deep breath)
It's official.

00:30.573 --> 00:33.866
A baby?
(laughing)

00:34.017 --> 00:35.183
(laughs)

00:35.286 --> 00:37.519
-(bell tinkles)
-(laughs): What is this?

00:37.538 --> 00:40.188
Uh, breakfast in bed.

00:40.249 --> 00:42.690
-Where did you even get this?
-Ah...

00:42.752 --> 00:44.359
NIC:
Pancakes?

00:44.420 --> 00:46.286
Your favorite.

00:46.422 --> 00:48.255
-Blue wildflowers.
-Aw...

00:50.334 --> 00:53.260
Nic's favorite berries. Ah!

00:53.387 --> 00:55.295
Get in there, get in there.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.130
All right. Mmm. Mmm.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.541
Whose dad do we want
to call first, yours or mine?

00:59.602 --> 01:02.061
I think we should wait
a little longer.

01:02.212 --> 01:05.455
Well, sure,
there's no rush to tell anyone.

01:05.474 --> 01:07.149
I mean, right?

01:10.387 --> 01:12.071
Your pregnancy
is already further along

01:12.222 --> 01:13.555
than it was last time.

01:13.616 --> 01:15.982
This time is gonna be different,
and it's...

01:16.077 --> 01:18.393
it's gonna be okay.
You know that, right?

01:18.412 --> 01:20.746
But we can't.

01:20.939 --> 01:24.833
I had a miscarriage,
and it was awful.

01:25.777 --> 01:27.419
And if it happens again,

01:27.588 --> 01:29.996
I don't want
to have to tell everyone,

01:30.132 --> 01:32.574
so I just...

01:32.635 --> 01:35.886
just want to wait
a little longer, okay?

01:39.100 --> 01:40.265
Of course.

01:40.458 --> 01:42.726
Whatever you want.

01:44.129 --> 01:45.771
Thank you.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.165
(knocking on door)

01:48.225 --> 01:49.516
(Devon groans)

01:49.652 --> 01:51.168
(knocking continues)

01:51.228 --> 01:52.778
I'm coming.

01:52.971 --> 01:54.929
(groans)

01:54.990 --> 01:56.949
(rapid knocking)

01:57.118 --> 01:59.343
All right!

02:00.121 --> 02:03.580
Did I park in someone's spot
or something?

02:05.459 --> 02:07.876
-(rapid knocking)
-(sighs) Okay!

02:09.413 --> 02:10.629
Mom. What are you...

02:10.822 --> 02:12.297
-what are you doing here?
-Surprise.

02:12.449 --> 02:14.758
I thought I'd
finally come visit my s...

02:16.587 --> 02:18.862
What happened to you?

02:18.922 --> 02:22.624
Oh, my God.
Were you in a car accident?

02:22.685 --> 02:24.792
I knew something was wrong.
I knew it.

02:24.854 --> 02:26.553
A mother always knows.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.129
Mom, I'm fine.

02:28.149 --> 02:30.798
We had an ER patient
with psychosis,

02:30.860 --> 02:34.802
and... someone should have
restrained him immediately,

02:34.864 --> 02:37.972
but we missed it,
and then he was...

02:38.033 --> 02:40.308
swinging at a nurse, and I...

02:40.327 --> 02:42.327
uh, went in to help.

02:42.520 --> 02:46.056
Yeah, in retrospect, I should
have just left it to the...

02:46.116 --> 02:47.666
security.

02:47.859 --> 02:49.817
You are a hero.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.579
My poor boy.
(sighs)

02:52.731 --> 02:54.339
But where are your pajamas, huh?

02:54.532 --> 02:55.565
And, uh...

02:55.626 --> 02:57.509
what is that smell?

02:57.661 --> 02:59.994
You know, just wait right here.
I just got to... I'll wash up.

03:00.055 --> 03:01.346
Hey, don't worry.

03:01.498 --> 03:04.607
I-I'm going to take care
of everything.

03:04.609 --> 03:05.893
(sighs)

03:09.381 --> 03:11.565
(panting)

03:17.105 --> 03:20.273
-(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)
-(footsteps approaching)

03:20.367 --> 03:21.758
(Austin chuckles)

03:21.777 --> 03:23.443
The way you drive
like a hellion,

03:23.595 --> 03:25.204
I was sure you'd beat me here.

03:25.355 --> 03:27.855
Normally, I would beat you here,
because you drive like a nun,

03:27.917 --> 03:30.600
but today... I stopped for this.

03:30.661 --> 03:31.952
-Doughnuts.
-Mm.

03:32.046 --> 03:34.604
Maple. I believe
they're your favorite.

03:34.665 --> 03:36.606
(chuckles)
And I believe you mentioned

03:36.667 --> 03:39.125
a fondness
for breakfast burritos.

03:39.220 --> 03:40.777
Oh, I do not hate

03:40.837 --> 03:42.721
this part of being
in a relationship.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.890
Oh, such high praise.

03:45.059 --> 03:48.635
Tell me, what can I do to make
sure you stay this effusive?

03:48.729 --> 03:50.954
There is one thing.

03:51.014 --> 03:54.399
Uh, you can...
(takes deep breath)

03:54.592 --> 03:57.194
marry me.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.198
♪

04:12.586 --> 04:15.479
My 0-1 visa is expiring.

04:15.497 --> 04:18.924
I knew it was coming,
so I applied way in advance.

04:19.075 --> 04:21.318
Yesterday I found out
it was denied.

04:21.420 --> 04:23.595
Mina, you should have
told me this yesterday.

04:23.788 --> 04:25.764
I was gonna tell you
when I came over last night,

04:25.957 --> 04:27.915
but you had made
such a nice dinner,

04:27.977 --> 04:31.770
and I didn't want to ruin it,
so... I said nothing.

04:31.963 --> 04:34.940
And then we got occupied
with other things.

04:36.301 --> 04:38.110
I don't understand
why the government

04:38.303 --> 04:39.594
would deny your renewal,

04:39.613 --> 04:41.338
as many American lives
as you've saved.

04:41.398 --> 04:45.008
Since February of 2020,
Nigerians are no longer able

04:45.068 --> 04:49.179
to obtain visas to immigrate
to the U.S. permanently.

04:49.239 --> 04:50.956
If I want to stay,
I have to find a way

04:51.149 --> 04:54.751
to renew my current visa
or marry an American citizen.

04:56.613 --> 05:00.281
-You are terrible at this.
-I applied months in advance.

05:00.301 --> 05:01.691
No, no, I mean this.

05:01.752 --> 05:04.044
You know, Mina,
proposals usually come...

05:04.138 --> 05:05.879
with a ring.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.807
-And a carefully crafted speech
-(clears throat)

05:09.000 --> 05:11.568
about commitment and love,
full of compliments.

05:11.570 --> 05:13.386
Flowers wouldn't hurt, either.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.038
-Okay, so will you do it?
-(stammers)

05:15.098 --> 05:17.057
You didn't even buy me
a nice dinner first.

05:17.151 --> 05:19.151
I got you doughnuts.

05:19.344 --> 05:21.903
True. And they're maple.

05:23.365 --> 05:25.490
Hey. Come here.

05:25.683 --> 05:27.551
Mm...
(inhales)

05:27.611 --> 05:29.553
Breathe.

05:29.613 --> 05:32.164
It's gonna be okay, Mina.

05:32.315 --> 05:33.557
We can make this work.

05:33.617 --> 05:35.167
All right?

05:35.360 --> 05:37.985
Love.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.153
Honor.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.413
Obey.

05:40.566 --> 05:42.824
Ooh, I love the way that sounds.

05:42.885 --> 05:44.584
-Don't you?
-Okay, uh,

05:44.736 --> 05:45.844
maybe we are rushing this.

05:45.995 --> 05:48.438
Oh, no,
we're definitely rushing this.

05:48.440 --> 05:49.806
(Austin chuckles)

05:53.854 --> 05:56.337
What's that about?

05:56.473 --> 05:58.231
Good morning.

05:59.684 --> 06:01.777
Good question.

06:02.854 --> 06:05.088
How's the other guy look?

06:05.107 --> 06:06.606
Funny.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.425
I couldn't sleep,
so I went out for a bike ride

06:08.485 --> 06:09.851
in the middle of the night.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.612
And it was pitch black,
and I was tired.

06:12.764 --> 06:13.855
Yeah, I know.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.481
-It was stupid.
-Mm.

06:15.584 --> 06:18.451
I, uh, hit a curb
and I wiped out.

06:18.587 --> 06:21.788
Oh, and then my mother showed up
this morning unannounced and,

06:21.940 --> 06:23.289
uh, I lied to her about it,

06:23.425 --> 06:24.791
because I didn't want her
to worry.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.636
(scoffs)
Anything else you want to know?

06:29.056 --> 06:32.632
Well, your father
passed away, and...

06:32.726 --> 06:34.467
It's been months.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.136
-I'm fine.
-You're not fine.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.304
You're grieving. You don't need
to put a timeline on it.

06:38.457 --> 06:39.973
Getting through it takes
as long as it takes.

06:40.125 --> 06:41.900
-Let's just talk
about how you're feeling.
-Okay.

06:42.051 --> 06:43.885
I said fine.

06:43.946 --> 06:46.053
You don't need to ask me again.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.814
WOMAN:
Excuse me? Excuse me?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.649
Can we get some help?

06:49.743 --> 06:51.651
Okay, what's going on?

06:51.745 --> 06:53.319
My daughter Trinity needs
medical attention.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.321
No, I don't.

06:55.416 --> 06:57.323
What's happening, Trinity?

06:57.418 --> 06:58.417
Show them.

06:58.568 --> 07:00.252
It looks worse than it is.

07:03.799 --> 07:05.090
My mom is making this
a big thing.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.651
Your hand looks like
a sea monster.

07:07.752 --> 07:10.578
It's a big thing.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.338
Whatever.
I tripped on the stairs.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.748
You, too?

07:13.809 --> 07:17.084
Um, bike accident.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.419
I don't need sedation.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.087
Just pop my fingers
back into place.

07:20.149 --> 07:22.832
Trust me,
I have a high pain tolerance.

07:22.851 --> 07:24.851
Look how well she tolerated
the existential pain

07:24.945 --> 07:28.171
of being stuck at home
with her mom during lockdown.

07:28.231 --> 07:30.115
I was supposed to speak
at my graduation.

07:30.308 --> 07:31.950
Then I didn't go to college
in the fall

07:32.119 --> 07:34.194
'cause it's all
distance learning.

07:34.288 --> 07:37.030
Apologies for our family drama.
It's been a year.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.823
Well, we're ready
to fix your fingers

07:39.017 --> 07:40.792
if you really want to do it
that way.

07:40.985 --> 07:42.461
-CONRAD: Positive?
-Yep.

07:42.654 --> 07:43.962
Okay.

07:46.291 --> 07:48.300
Trinity, look at your mom.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.362
Let's remember the good parts
of lockdown.

07:52.422 --> 07:55.122
-(cracks)
-(grunting)

07:55.258 --> 07:57.033
The tap shoes.

07:57.093 --> 07:58.626
-The quail.
-(cracks)
-(grunts)

07:58.687 --> 08:00.294
-Quail?
-We incubated eggs

08:00.355 --> 08:02.630
and raised them to adulthood.

08:02.691 --> 08:04.966
-Kept the only girl.
-Sidney Vicious.

08:05.027 --> 08:07.819
Ah, Sidney Vicious.
I love that name.

08:07.971 --> 08:09.988
She's coming with me
when I get my own apartment,

08:10.157 --> 08:12.473
which I'm supposed
to look at today.

08:12.534 --> 08:13.825
(whispers):
Finally.

08:13.977 --> 08:15.309
You're all done.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.621
You should be good
to apartment hunt now.

08:19.115 --> 08:20.999
Actually,
there's something else.

08:21.150 --> 08:23.226
-This wasn't
Trinity's first fall.
-Mom, stop.

08:23.286 --> 08:24.503
You said we didn't have to...

08:24.654 --> 08:25.745
She's been off lately.

08:25.897 --> 08:27.655
Something
with her balance, maybe.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.156
We can take a look at that.

08:29.218 --> 08:31.176
I said no.
I just want to go and get my...

08:31.369 --> 08:33.512
If you want a cosigner
for that apartment,

08:33.705 --> 08:36.330
you will stay in that bed
and let the doctors work.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.907
CONRAD:
It will be quick.

08:37.926 --> 08:39.909
We'll get X-rays on your hand
just to be safe.

08:39.970 --> 08:42.169
And then we'll be back
for a full physical.

08:42.231 --> 08:43.980
I'll let imaging know.

08:48.770 --> 08:52.013
<i> MAN (over P.A.):</i>
<i> Procurement coordinator</i>
<i> to the ICU.</i>

08:52.074 --> 08:53.940
Quail.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.183
Maybe Nic and I need
to bring some variety

08:56.286 --> 08:57.518
to our chicken coop, huh?

08:57.538 --> 09:00.187
Well, it sounds like Trinity...

09:00.290 --> 09:03.116
wants independence
more than any bird.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.102
I hear the mother-daughter thing
can be tough sometimes.

09:06.121 --> 09:08.121
Yeah, the mother-son thing is
no walk in the park, either.

09:08.257 --> 09:10.549
My mom wants to know
where I keep the disinfectant,

09:10.717 --> 09:12.776
the trash bags,
the<i> good</i> toilet paper.

09:12.836 --> 09:15.887
-(laughs)
-This is the last thing
I need right now.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.447
I don't know. Maybe
you can set some boundaries

09:17.465 --> 09:19.683
with her or something?

09:22.120 --> 09:24.788
I'm not really looking
for advice here.

09:24.848 --> 09:26.623
I'm doing my job,
I'm not making any mistakes.

09:26.683 --> 09:28.233
Anything beyond that
is not your business.

09:28.426 --> 09:30.643
It's my business that my friend
is upset and grieving.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.071
Can you stop trying
to doctor this?

09:33.264 --> 09:35.681
Okay? I need a minute.
Can you handle the exam?

09:35.784 --> 09:38.034
-Yeah.
-Okay.

09:43.274 --> 09:45.158
So the good news is
that the PR coming in

09:45.252 --> 09:47.477
from my show's segment
on the patient helped.

09:47.495 --> 09:50.071
And Yorn thinks that Chastain
might still be valuable enough

09:50.090 --> 09:52.239
to take selling the hospital
off the table.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.575
The bad news is,

09:54.595 --> 09:58.245

the empty CEO seat with me.

I thought you weren't keen
on the job anymore,

10:00.267 --> 10:02.826

-Trust me, I don't want it.

10:02.844 --> 10:04.603
Even if I said yes,

10:04.796 --> 10:06.438
Red Rock could
still dump Chastain

10:06.589 --> 10:08.255
if we don't rebound financially.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.941
And we'd be under the thumb
of some other conglomerate.

10:10.134 --> 10:11.851

out there

10:11.945 --> 10:14.504

than Red Rock.

to cheer you up.

young woman over there

It makes sense.

19:35.216 --> 19:37.925
It makes sense
if you're in love.

19:39.387 --> 19:41.721
Are you in love with him?

19:45.927 --> 19:47.259
Okay.

19:47.353 --> 19:50.262
The reason I didn't want you
to get upset

19:50.415 --> 19:54.192
is because I think
you also have a secret.

19:54.343 --> 19:56.843
Yesterday, you took a power nap
in the nurses' lounge.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.196
You have developed
the superpower

19:58.347 --> 20:00.423
-to smell doughnuts a hall away.
-(sighs)

20:00.524 --> 20:02.091
Your hair is extra lustrous.

20:02.151 --> 20:05.185
And some might say
you're glowing.

20:05.246 --> 20:06.913
(chuckles softly)

20:09.325 --> 20:11.116
-Okay, it's early.
-Mm-hmm.

20:11.269 --> 20:14.212
-I'm not ready to talk about it.
-Okay.

20:14.363 --> 20:15.621
I will keep your secret.

20:15.757 --> 20:17.122
Please keep mine.

20:17.258 --> 20:19.050
For now.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.552
And congratulations.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.949
(footsteps approaching)

20:26.968 --> 20:30.210
Your girl here is
a missing person.

20:31.289 --> 20:33.397
I called her house
and talked to her roommate.

20:33.590 --> 20:36.308
Two days ago, she left for
groceries and never came home.

20:36.402 --> 20:39.645
Pravesh said
her head CT came back normal.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.313
No drugs in her system.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.557
Did the roommate say anything
about a history

20:43.576 --> 20:45.150
-of mental illness?
-I asked.

20:45.245 --> 20:46.577
None that she knew of.

20:46.770 --> 20:47.745
She's trying to get in touch
with her family

20:47.896 --> 20:48.988
on the West Coast.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.957
Then maybe this is
a new diagnosis.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.325
-It might be
her first psychotic break.
-Mm.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.628
She's in the right age range.

20:59.250 --> 21:01.333
Can't treat her
till we find out what it is.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.411
Well, Dr. Pravesh is on his way
to do a full exam.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.556
-I'll keep you posted.
-Okay. Thank you.

21:10.386 --> 21:12.770
Lots of people faint.

21:12.963 --> 21:14.847
True. But you fainted

21:14.941 --> 21:17.257
because your heart
was beating abnormally.

21:17.277 --> 21:18.684
We need to find out why.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.278
We ordered a few more lab tests,
okay, Trinity?

21:20.429 --> 21:23.355
Mmm. Your coffee smells
like heaven.

21:23.491 --> 21:25.616
-Is that hazelnut?
-Yeah.

21:25.809 --> 21:27.285
-I'm gonna go get us some, Trin.
-That's weird.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.436
I can't smell it.

21:30.647 --> 21:33.349
What do you mean
you can't smell it?

21:33.409 --> 21:34.683
(sniffs)
What about this?

21:34.744 --> 21:36.252
My perfume?

21:37.580 --> 21:38.687
She can't have COVID, can she?

21:38.748 --> 21:40.781
Let's all just take a breath.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.966
Loss of smell can be a symptom
of multiple things.

21:42.159 --> 21:43.617
No, no, no, no.
We were so careful.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.786
We-we-we got
all our groceries delivered.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.139
-We didn't see friends. We...
-It could be allergies
or a cold.

Even when we joined a pod
and we tested positive,

21:50.167 --> 21:52.793
we-we-we were lucky because
we didn't have any symptoms.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.812
-Okay. Good, good.
-(breathing heavily)

Is that bad? It sounds bad.

22:21.257 --> 22:22.823
Your mom collapsed because she's

22:22.925 --> 22:24.825
actually having
a heart attack right now.

22:24.886 --> 22:26.660
Oh, my God.
How is that possible?

22:26.721 --> 22:28.587
Her EKG shows evidence

22:28.723 --> 22:30.573
of another heart attack

Has your mom ever had chest pain
or shortness of breath before?

22:36.522 --> 22:38.022
The protests.

22:38.173 --> 22:39.673
When George Floyd was murdered.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.266
We made our signs
and we went out there.

22:41.361 --> 22:43.752
It was supposed to be peaceful,
but it didn't matter.

22:43.813 --> 22:46.346
They tear gassed us all.

22:46.366 --> 22:48.366
That must've been awful.

22:52.413 --> 22:55.447
she felt like an elephant
was sitting on her chest.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.282
I wanted to take her
to the hospital,

22:57.418 --> 22:59.952
but she was afraid we were
gonna catch COVID again.

23:00.046 --> 23:03.288
Back then, we didn't know
if that was possible.

23:03.383 --> 23:05.383
She was afraid.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.534
Okay, that could be it.

23:07.595 --> 23:09.111
Tear gas can cause stress

23:09.171 --> 23:12.056

Your mom has

We need to get her
to a cath lab now.

We'll put a stent in to open up
the clogged arteries

-in her heart.
-Don't worry.

I spoke
to an immigration lawyer.

27:24.093 --> 27:26.810
If we get married,
it could raise red flags.

27:27.003 --> 27:28.646
Why?

27:28.839 --> 27:30.481
We've known each other
for years.

27:30.632 --> 27:32.816
It's easy to prove we have
a basis for a real marriage.

27:33.009 --> 27:34.652
But this version of us is new.

We don't have photos or records

will ask "Why now?"

They can ask
all the questions they want.

27:41.443 --> 27:42.809
We got nothing to hide.

27:42.828 --> 27:44.144
The lawyer said
the presumption will be

27:44.163 --> 27:47.072
that our marriage
is not bona fide.

27:47.224 --> 27:49.224
If there is an investigation
and it goes badly,

allowed back in the country.

27:53.029 --> 27:54.821
Not allowed back in the country?

27:54.840 --> 27:56.322
You could face
felony charges for perjury.

27:56.425 --> 27:58.233
Not if I don't perjure myself.

27:58.293 --> 28:01.161
Mina, if we end up in court,
I will tell them the truth.

28:01.222 --> 28:02.888
The marriage is real.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.760
Unless you're saying
you don't think it'll be real.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.854
Okay, AJ, you're not hearing me.

If we get married
right after my visa denial,

28:12.975 --> 28:16.176
no matter what we say or do,
I can still get deported.

28:16.237 --> 28:18.904
It's putting us both at risk
and I refuse to do that.

28:20.866 --> 28:23.867
-So you're saying
the wedding is off.
-I am.

28:25.079 --> 28:27.446

29:26.098 --> 29:29.099
I-I eat cafeteria food,
I have women over

29:29.251 --> 29:30.993
who might not be Indian,
and that is my choice.

29:31.053 --> 29:34.146
I don't want any of this.
I don't need it.

29:35.966 --> 29:38.567
You should have asked
before coming here.

29:39.803 --> 29:42.196
We both miss your father.

29:43.949 --> 29:46.241
I thought we could
help each other.

29:48.788 --> 29:50.937
Well, you should have
called first.

29:51.982 --> 29:55.033
My calls go
straight to voice mail.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.795
And when you do answer,
it's always,

29:57.946 --> 30:00.923
"I only have a minute,"
or "I have to get back."

30:02.918 --> 30:06.762
I didn't ask if I could visit
because I knew you'd say no.

30:12.645 --> 30:15.103
(exhales)

30:16.339 --> 30:18.982
Two minutes in the microwave.

30:23.847 --> 30:29.309
Well, the famous Sidney Vicious
won't be lonely tonight.

30:29.370 --> 30:31.219
We should be able
to get you out of here soon.

30:31.280 --> 30:36.391
You have a rare genetic
disease called Refsum syndrome.

30:36.451 --> 30:38.560
-Does my mom have it, too?
-No.

30:38.579 --> 30:40.896
She's a carrier of the mutation,
but to get the disease,

30:40.956 --> 30:43.081
you have to have
two genetic defects.

30:43.233 --> 30:46.659
Basically, y-your body
isn't able to process

30:46.679 --> 30:48.178
a certain type of fat.

30:48.330 --> 30:50.906
Over time, that causes toxicity
to multiple organs.

30:50.966 --> 30:52.407
That's why you were falling.

30:52.467 --> 30:55.168
And it's why your heart
was giving you trouble.

30:55.187 --> 30:56.928
Here's the good news:
it's totally manageable.

30:57.022 --> 30:59.839
We caught it early,
which is fantastic.

30:59.900 --> 31:02.250
And my buddy Dr. Pravesh and I,
we think changes

31:02.311 --> 31:03.768
in your diet are gonna
do the trick.

31:03.863 --> 31:07.105
So we'll hook you up
with a nutritionist,

31:07.257 --> 31:08.848
and we'll schedule
regular appointments

31:08.909 --> 31:10.742
to keep an eye on everything.

31:12.955 --> 31:16.582
I acted like everything was fine
because I wanted it to be.

31:18.252 --> 31:20.360
You wanted life to be normal.
We all do.

31:20.421 --> 31:24.882
Yeah, but Mom knew something
was wrong with me.

31:25.885 --> 31:27.776
Yeah, well,
sometimes our parents

31:27.794 --> 31:29.778
see things that we don't see
in ourselves.

31:29.838 --> 31:33.281
I stomped around like
the world was happening to me.

31:33.342 --> 31:35.800
While she was the one who
actually had something wrong.

31:35.953 --> 31:37.377
CONRAD:
Eh, don't take that on.

31:37.396 --> 31:40.138
You and your mom,
you got through the impossible.

31:40.290 --> 31:42.882
Cut yourself a break.
Celebrate it.

31:42.985 --> 31:45.736
I've been so annoyed with my mom
this whole time,

31:45.929 --> 31:50.723
but now it's like...
I just want her to be okay.

31:50.784 --> 31:52.558
-I need her.
-(phone vibrating)

31:52.620 --> 31:55.621
I'm pretty sure
she needs you, too.

31:58.584 --> 32:00.792
It's Nic.

32:01.587 --> 32:04.046
Go.

32:09.762 --> 32:11.836
CONRAD:
Oh, wow.

32:11.931 --> 32:15.748
Doesn't matter how many times
I've seen one of these.

32:15.809 --> 32:19.102
It's different when it's ours.

32:19.295 --> 32:20.679
It's magical.

32:20.831 --> 32:22.606
Oh, look. That's the heartbeat.

32:22.799 --> 32:25.000
(both laugh)

32:25.018 --> 32:27.836
-Ah. Looks like a fighter.
-GABBI: I agree.

32:27.896 --> 32:30.781
Growing just like it should be.
That is a perfect baby.

32:30.974 --> 32:33.617
(exhales):
This is good.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.745
I love you.

32:37.647 --> 32:39.364
I love you, too.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.083
(exhales)

32:42.294 --> 32:43.627
Want to know what you're having?

32:43.820 --> 32:45.921
-(laughs)
-Uh...

32:48.801 --> 32:50.884
TRINITY:
Mom?

32:51.920 --> 32:53.786
Mom?

32:53.889 --> 32:55.806
I'm right here, Mama.

32:58.334 --> 32:59.851
Hi, baby.

33:01.004 --> 33:03.463
The doctors fixed your heart.

33:03.524 --> 33:06.708
We managed to place a stent
in your blocked artery.

33:06.768 --> 33:08.652
You get to go home
in a couple of days.

33:10.047 --> 33:12.138
Well, we didn't make it
to your apartment.

33:12.199 --> 33:13.306
It's okay.

33:13.367 --> 33:14.883
I'm not moving out anymore.

33:14.943 --> 33:16.976
I'm gonna stay home with you.

33:17.037 --> 33:19.162
The hell you are.

33:20.356 --> 33:25.227
You think I helped those wings
grow strong just to clip them?

33:25.287 --> 33:27.320
You're ready to fly.

33:27.381 --> 33:30.415
But what if you need me?

33:30.567 --> 33:32.217
Then I'll call you.

33:35.723 --> 33:36.996
BELL:
Pickups to me.

33:37.057 --> 33:38.831
KIT:
These buggers are everywhere.

33:38.851 --> 33:40.517
BELL:
Well, we're making
good progress.

33:40.668 --> 33:42.835
Last time with one of these
tumors, it took hours to ligate

33:42.855 --> 33:44.021
all vessels.

33:44.172 --> 33:45.522
KIT:
I think we're lucky she's young,

33:45.715 --> 33:47.249
and we caught this
while it was still small.

33:47.350 --> 33:49.008
BELL:
Metz?

33:49.903 --> 33:53.179
KIT:
I see why you don't want
to be CEO.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.923
You're a wizard in the OR.

33:54.941 --> 33:57.425
Still, Chastain needs you.

33:57.486 --> 33:59.685
It's about quality of life, Kit.

33:59.747 --> 34:02.021
That's why you should do it.

34:02.082 --> 34:06.526
As CEO, you can hire
anyone you want.

34:06.628 --> 34:08.620
-(scoffs)
-Remind me, Randolph.

34:08.756 --> 34:11.623
What are the
"Cs of medical cash flow"?

34:11.775 --> 34:13.699
-I'm not doing that.
-I'll start.

34:13.761 --> 34:16.795
Chemo, cataracts, colonoscopies.
Come on, give me one.

34:16.889 --> 34:19.631
-Cancer.
-Already covered
when I said "chemo." Try again.

34:19.725 --> 34:21.466
Cosmetic surgery.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.226
There you go.

34:23.378 --> 34:27.731
You could gain financial ground
by hiring a rock star

34:27.882 --> 34:29.474
-plastic surgeon.
-(scoffs)

34:29.568 --> 34:31.359
Like your stepson Jake.

34:32.279 --> 34:34.237
-Cauterize.
-I am.

34:34.430 --> 34:36.406
Trust me, the kid doesn't want
to be anywhere near me,

34:36.558 --> 34:38.149
much less work under me.

34:38.243 --> 34:42.871
Maybe you could sweeten the deal
if you took Yorn's offer.

34:49.296 --> 34:52.238
Did I...
did I give you a picture?

34:52.257 --> 34:54.907
Don't worry. It went straight
in the shredder.

34:54.968 --> 34:57.260
Never mind. I don't want
to remember anything else.

34:57.453 --> 34:58.762
No, it's not your fault.

34:58.955 --> 35:00.822
You had a very rare type
of tumor

35:00.841 --> 35:02.099
that secreted hormones,

35:02.292 --> 35:04.676
and it caused your behavior
to change.

35:04.828 --> 35:06.845
-What happens now?
-KIT: We have to wait

35:06.939 --> 35:09.755
for pathology results
to stage it appropriately,

35:09.866 --> 35:11.608
but we have some
of the finest oncologists

35:11.801 --> 35:13.685
here who will help
with the next steps.

35:13.837 --> 35:15.854
BELL:
And we can already see
your mental status is improving.

35:15.948 --> 35:18.448
Try not to be embarrassed.

35:18.641 --> 35:20.024
If you hadn't followed
Dr. Bell here,

35:20.119 --> 35:21.952
who knows when
you would've been diagnosed.

35:22.145 --> 35:26.014
-Okay. But still, Dr. Bell.
-Mm.

35:26.032 --> 35:28.199
You're like four decades
too old for me.

35:28.293 --> 35:30.518
I don't think four is right.

35:30.620 --> 35:32.712
You're like my grandpa.

35:34.782 --> 35:35.948
Or father.

35:36.009 --> 35:37.950
KIT:
It's fortunate we caught it

35:37.970 --> 35:41.529
-when we did. Get some rest.
-(Bell clears throat)

35:41.590 --> 35:43.223
Let's go, Gramps.

35:45.018 --> 35:47.060
Thanks.

35:50.524 --> 35:52.465
Hey, Nic.

35:52.526 --> 35:54.609
-Hey.
-Um...

35:55.821 --> 35:57.545
I'm giving these back to you.

35:57.564 --> 36:01.307
And, um, I shouldn't have
put you in that weird position.

36:01.368 --> 36:03.218
I'm sorry.

36:03.278 --> 36:05.387
It did feel strange

36:05.488 --> 36:07.330
giving them to you.

36:07.523 --> 36:09.958
Um, but are you okay?

36:12.362 --> 36:13.503
Everyone keeps asking me that.

36:13.696 --> 36:15.154
I guess I need to figure it out.

36:15.257 --> 36:17.841
Yeah, figuring it out will help.

36:18.034 --> 36:21.994
And you know I'm here
if you need anything, right?

36:22.055 --> 36:23.829
Yeah.

36:23.891 --> 36:26.725
-Thanks again.
-Mm.

36:29.396 --> 36:30.854
What's all that about?

36:31.005 --> 36:32.838
Well, I was just
texting everybody.

36:32.900 --> 36:35.525
-Check your phone.

36:39.740 --> 36:41.180

She didn't say why.

-Do you know why we're here?
-We'll find out soon enough.

36:45.746 --> 36:47.929
I'm guessing a baby.
They just got married.

36:47.948 --> 36:50.749
-It's got to be a baby.
-Shh. Don't jinx it.

36:52.494 --> 36:54.269

to be the first to know.

-You're having a baby?
-Don't jinx it.

-Guess it was obvious.
-Oh!

37:00.444 --> 37:02.368

You know?

You cannot blame yourself.

If I...

38:45.991 --> 38:48.808
just moved him
to a different hospital,

38:48.869 --> 38:52.887

to his doctors more often...

38:55.858 --> 38:58.084
No, Mom. That was his choice.

And then, the system failed him.

39:04.534 --> 39:06.718
And it failed us.

Listen, that isn't your fault.

Well, it's not yours, either.

I'm listening.

40:26.633 --> 40:29.408
I don't often apologize,

40:29.469 --> 40:31.577
because I rarely make mistakes,

40:31.638 --> 40:34.431
but today, I made one.

40:34.624 --> 40:38.009
I shouldn't have
proposed to you like that

40:38.103 --> 40:40.995
without doing
the proper research.

40:41.014 --> 40:43.231
You had every right to be upset.

40:44.834 --> 40:47.444
You were in a tough spot.

40:47.637 --> 40:49.520
You still are.

40:49.673 --> 40:54.358
I asked you the impossible and
you agreed without hesitation.

40:54.453 --> 40:56.744
I'm grateful for that.

40:57.456 --> 40:59.080
Okay.

41:02.461 --> 41:06.212
Nic asked me
if I'm in love with you.

41:07.624 --> 41:09.949
I didn't know
what to say then, but...

41:10.051 --> 41:12.469
now I do.

41:15.557 --> 41:17.557
It's yes.

41:19.260 --> 41:23.229
I am... in love with you.

41:29.988 --> 41:31.845

41:41.750 --> 41:42.999
Except, I may still be deported.

41:43.192 --> 41:45.668
No. No, no,
that's not gonna happen.

41:45.861 --> 41:49.923
We are not gonna
let that happen, guaranteed.

41:52.052 --> 41:54.569
You know I love you, too, right?

41:54.587 --> 41:57.472
I suspected so.

42:01.228 --> 42:03.761
What'd I tell you? Huh?
Magnificent lobby.

42:03.913 --> 42:06.247
-I think it would fall
right in line with what...
-Jacob.

42:06.349 --> 42:08.674
Your, uh, office

42:08.735 --> 42:10.918
was my next stop
after I finished this tour.

42:10.937 --> 42:12.587
Well, uh,

42:12.605 --> 42:14.255
pardon the interruption.
Do you mind if I just steal him

42:14.357 --> 42:16.241
for just a moment?

42:20.080 --> 42:22.539
I've decided to accept
Red Rock's generous offer.

42:22.732 --> 42:24.023
I'm confident, as CEO,

42:24.084 --> 42:25.950
I can turn
our financial situation around.

42:26.086 --> 42:28.119
And I have
some initial thoughts about...

42:28.255 --> 42:29.620
Since last we spoke,
Red Rock has had

42:29.756 --> 42:31.622
to make
some very difficult decisions.

42:31.775 --> 42:35.468
So that CEO spot--
no longer open.

42:37.764 --> 42:39.797
Who are you filling it with?

42:39.949 --> 42:43.117
No one. We sold Chastain.

42:43.219 --> 42:46.804
Well, um, I'll be happy to work
with the new conglomerate

42:46.898 --> 42:48.565
-in any way...
-Look around. Look around.

42:48.716 --> 42:50.883
We are standing on
a prime piece of real estate.

42:50.986 --> 42:53.886
These buyers are developers.

42:53.947 --> 42:55.630
Yeah.

42:55.690 --> 42:59.033
They're turning Chastain
into luxury condos.

43:02.581 --> 43:04.063
My apologies.

43:04.082 --> 43:05.823
Why don't we walk over
to the elevators here.

43:05.917 --> 43:08.418
I want you guys to get that
magnificent view from up top.
