RuPaul: Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

00:03.303 --> 00:06.106
Based on your Snatch Game
performances,

00:06.106 --> 00:09.877
you are all up for elimination.

00:09.877 --> 00:16.416
So tonight, we're throwing
a Lip Sync Lalaparuza Smackdown,

00:16.416 --> 00:19.353
a series of six lip syncs.

00:19.353 --> 00:20.854
If you win your lip sync,

00:20.854 --> 00:23.457
you will be safe
from elimination.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.058
Daya Betty.
Willow Pill.

00:25.058 --> 00:26.760
Jorgeous.

Angeria.

00:27.995 --> 00:29.263
Shantay you stay.

00:30.831 --> 00:34.701
If you lose,
you'll continue to face off

00:34.701 --> 00:37.337
until two queens remain.

00:37.337 --> 00:40.841
Bosco, Jasmine,
I've made my decision.

00:43.010 --> 00:47.147
Bosco, shantay you stay.

00:48.148 --> 00:49.283
Thank you.

I am exhausted,

01:29.856 --> 01:31.858
that I made it through
the Lalaparuza,

-Hell, yeah.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.336
Miss Jasmine somehow manages

I don't know if there's
even, like, enough cleaner

01:52.112 --> 01:53.613
to get this shit
off the mirror.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.549
"Hope y'all the best."

01:55.549 --> 01:57.384
It just makes me love her more.

02:05.192 --> 02:06.460
Aw!

02:06.460 --> 02:11.465
Angie, DeJa, Jorgeous,
you better go all the way.

02:11.465 --> 02:15.202
[sighs] I'd be more offended
if you were here saying it,

02:15.202 --> 02:16.370
but you're gone,

02:16.370 --> 02:19.873
so I guess I can't be
that offended.

02:19.873 --> 02:23.210
They really made both of us
do three lip syncs.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.045
And she'd already
been at, what, three?

02:25.045 --> 02:27.414
So she's the most
lip-synced diva of all time.

02:27.414 --> 02:29.349
In Drag Race history, yep.

02:29.349 --> 02:30.951
Werk.
[all laugh]

02:30.951 --> 02:32.519
But when it comes
to a competition

02:32.519 --> 02:35.956
between, like, being a giant ho,
you're not gonna beat me.

02:35.956 --> 02:37.624
[all laugh]

02:37.624 --> 02:38.759
Toodles!

02:38.759 --> 02:40.694
I may have had to lip sync

02:40.694 --> 02:42.362
the most times last week,

02:42.362 --> 02:45.065
but I don't think
that is indicative

02:45.065 --> 02:48.001
of me being a lesser performer
than the other girls.

02:48.001 --> 02:51.104
I still have the most wins
tied with Angie,

02:51.104 --> 02:53.340
and if anything,
being at the bottom

02:53.340 --> 02:55.275
just gives me residual anger

02:55.275 --> 02:57.878
that I'm just, like,
using to fuel me.

02:57.878 --> 03:01.048
Was there anything that you guys
truly took away from it

03:01.048 --> 03:03.483
except for I will never
wanna do Snatch Game again?

03:03.483 --> 03:05.919
I think I learned that Ru
wants to see more of you

03:05.919 --> 03:08.455
than the person
you're trying to be.

03:08.455 --> 03:09.623
Yeah.

03:09.623 --> 03:10.991
I didn't learn shit.

03:10.991 --> 03:12.459
[all laugh]

03:12.459 --> 03:13.460

03:13.460 --> 03:14.761

03:14.761 --> 03:17.230
She done already
done had herses!

03:17.230 --> 03:18.799
What's next?

03:18.799 --> 03:20.534
Hey, showgirls.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.868
-Hello!
-Hi!

03:21.868 --> 03:23.870
I see Paris, I see France,

03:23.870 --> 03:27.007
I see queens
who sing and dance.

03:27.007 --> 03:30.310
But the greatest thing
you'll ever learnt

03:30.310 --> 03:32.913
is just to keep
your can-can turnt.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.681
Aah!

03:34.681 --> 03:37.050
Are we going to Paris?

03:37.050 --> 03:38.485
Hello, hello, hello!

03:38.485 --> 03:41.254
Hi, pussy bow!

03:42.789 --> 03:44.825
Everybody say l'amour!

03:44.825 --> 03:46.827
-L'amour!
-L'amour!

03:46.827 --> 03:48.962
For this week's maxi-challenge,

03:48.962 --> 03:52.265
you need to take us
to gay Paree!

03:52.265 --> 03:53.433
-Yes!
-Whoo!

03:53.433 --> 03:54.734
As you star

03:54.734 --> 03:58.805
in the most romantic
Rusical of all time:

03:58.805 --> 04:00.240
Moulin Ru!

04:02.776 --> 04:07.180

The Musical on Broadway.

04:07.180 --> 04:10.217
Yay! I'm really excited
for a Rusical challenge.

04:10.217 --> 04:12.219
Rusicals are my favorite
challenges to watch.

04:12.219 --> 04:13.920
This is gonna be an opportunity

04:13.920 --> 04:18.492
to show the judges
that ♪ she's a performer ♪

04:18.492 --> 04:21.061
Set in an iconic
Paris drag club,

04:21.061 --> 04:24.898
the Rusical features
several many iconic roles.

04:24.898 --> 04:26.266
Ooh.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.535
There's Saltine,
the tragic showgirl

04:28.535 --> 04:32.339
torn between love and money.

04:32.339 --> 04:36.409
There's Mama Z, a bearded queen
and the owner of the Moulin Ru.

04:36.409 --> 04:37.944
There's the Green Fairy.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.547
Think of her as a genie
in a bottle...

04:40.547 --> 04:42.315
-...of absinthe.
-Oh, okay.

04:42.315 --> 04:43.717
And last but not least,

04:43.717 --> 04:47.954
there are four scene-stealing
Moulin Ru girls:

04:47.954 --> 04:52.225
Charisma, Uniqueness,
Nerve, and Talent.

04:52.225 --> 04:53.426
Yes!

04:53.426 --> 04:56.163
Now, I'll let you decide
who plays which part.

04:58.598 --> 04:59.633
Oh, my God, here we go.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.968
I don't know
how this is gonna go,

05:01.968 --> 05:04.471
but I know that I better get
the fucking part I want.

05:04.471 --> 05:05.472
That's all I know.

05:05.472 --> 05:08.108
Now, later today
you'll rehearse

05:08.108 --> 05:10.810
with Moulin Ru composer Leland.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.479
-Oh!
-Oh!

05:12.479 --> 05:14.848
Choreographer Miguel Zarate.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.683
[cheering]

05:16.683 --> 05:20.720
-Plus a mystery guest director.
-[gasps]

05:20.720 --> 05:25.592
Then tomorrow, you will debut
Moulin Ru on the main stage.

05:25.592 --> 05:27.260
All right.

05:27.260 --> 05:30.597
So don't, pardon my French,
fuck it up.

05:30.597 --> 05:31.598
Okay!

05:31.598 --> 05:32.933
Oh, yeah, I speak French.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.301
[all laugh]

05:34.301 --> 05:36.069
I am ecstatic.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.238
This feels like
it very much aligns

05:38.238 --> 05:39.639
with who Bosco is
as a performer,

05:39.639 --> 05:43.677
and I have the opportunity
to really blow their socks off

05:43.677 --> 05:44.844
with the next week.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.080
Racers, start your engines,

05:47.080 --> 05:50.884
and may the best drag queen win.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.319
What are we doing?

05:52.319 --> 05:54.421
Oh!

05:54.421 --> 05:55.855
I feel like this time around,

05:55.855 --> 05:58.959
choosing roles is gonna be
a little more difficult.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.293
-Let's listen.
-Let's listen to this.

06:00.293 --> 06:02.195
Because we're getting to
the point of the competition

06:02.195 --> 06:04.431
where the judges
have to notice you.

06:04.431 --> 06:06.333
Ooh! [laughs]

06:06.333 --> 06:07.434
I would love to do this one.

06:07.434 --> 06:09.569
I really want the Talent role,

06:09.569 --> 06:13.240
because, girl,
show-stopping, very Xtina vibes,

06:13.240 --> 06:16.576
and that's very me,
because, girl, show-stopping.

06:16.576 --> 06:18.979
Oh, I think I want this one.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.347
-That was hot.
-Ahh.

06:20.347 --> 06:22.115
The salty Saltine!

06:22.115 --> 06:24.351
So cute!

06:24.351 --> 06:25.685
Yeah.

06:25.685 --> 06:28.054
The role of Saltine
is the lead role.

06:28.054 --> 06:33.960
She is a cabaret burlesque
courtesan superstar.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.229
That is Bosco.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.598
I know what I've got my eye on.

06:38.598 --> 06:41.101
I have my heart set
on getting Saltine.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.536
After the feedback from Michelle

06:43.536 --> 06:45.672
about being quiet
and softly spoken...

06:45.672 --> 06:47.941
Your softness and your shyness

06:47.941 --> 06:49.576
will affect you
in this competition.

06:49.576 --> 06:53.179
I feel like this is kind of
the opportunity to do it in.

06:53.179 --> 06:57.284
[cheering]

06:57.284 --> 06:58.518
I know what I want.

06:58.518 --> 07:00.053
I know who I wanna be.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.355
I want Uniqueness, period.

07:02.355 --> 07:06.192
I think I've established
that compromise is for losers.

07:06.192 --> 07:08.561
I was the winner
of last week's challenge,

07:08.561 --> 07:11.264
and the last
sixties challenge,

07:11.264 --> 07:13.300
I gave up whatever the fuck
I wanted to you guys, correct?

07:13.300 --> 07:14.768
Correct.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.202
Let me have Nerve.

07:17.570 --> 07:19.406
Does anyone want Nerve?

07:19.406 --> 07:21.241
Perf!

07:21.241 --> 07:22.575
Kudos to Miss DeJa,

07:22.575 --> 07:23.943
but I don't think
winning Snatch Game

07:23.943 --> 07:26.513
is a good reason to decide
that you could have a role.

07:26.513 --> 07:29.549
But, like, I didn't want
that role, so werk.

07:29.549 --> 07:31.818
I like Talent and Green Fairy.

07:31.818 --> 07:33.486
I like Green Fairy
because I feel like

07:33.486 --> 07:37.424
if you think of a little
green absinthe fairy, it's me.

07:37.424 --> 07:38.625
I do think of Willow.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.060
And I really wanna have
that moment.

07:40.060 --> 07:43.263
Willow can have the Green Fairy.
That's fine.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.965
But I got my foot
on this Talent role.

07:45.965 --> 07:49.402
I want Talent because, bitch,
I think I am show-stopping,

07:49.402 --> 07:51.504
and I definitely showed that
in the last lip sync.

07:51.504 --> 07:54.974
And I've been the team player
for almost all the challenges,

07:54.974 --> 07:56.743
and now I'm putting
my fucking foot down.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.311
I mean, there's been a lot of us

07:58.311 --> 08:01.748
who's just been very
courteous of other people

08:01.748 --> 08:06.219
this entire competition, so it's
about right here and right now.

08:06.219 --> 08:07.487
Does anyone want Charisma?

08:07.487 --> 08:09.556
I don't think anyone's
spoken on Charisma yet.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.725
It's the gold digger
who likes sugar daddies.

08:11.725 --> 08:14.060
No, that role
would not be good for me,

08:14.060 --> 08:16.496
and it does not
fit me whatsoever.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.932
Girl.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.735
You know what? I'm gonna
go ahead and call Charisma.

08:21.735 --> 08:24.104
I am an entertainer,

08:24.104 --> 08:28.208
and Angie's gonna do
what Angie does, so...

08:28.208 --> 08:29.509
This is frustrating.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.746
I don't wanna get lost
in the crowd in this number,

08:32.746 --> 08:36.182
but somebody had to eat
the boo-boo in this moment.

08:37.484 --> 08:39.052
I want Saltine.

08:39.052 --> 08:40.653
I also want Saltine.

08:40.653 --> 08:43.456
It feels like very much my vibe.

08:43.456 --> 08:47.360
I embody Saltine, and I am also
putting my foot down for her.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.662
Okay, yes, there is
a sexiness to it,

08:49.662 --> 08:52.332
but I feel like I showed
the other side of Saltine,

08:52.332 --> 08:54.200
which is the romance
and the love story.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.835
And I feel like I've proved that
to the judges

08:55.835 --> 08:58.238
as I beat you in the lip sync.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.806
That is a good point.

08:59.806 --> 09:02.809
Do you think you would have
beaten me in Swept Away?

09:02.809 --> 09:04.077
Yes, I do.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.746
Mm, that's a bold opinion.

09:06.746 --> 09:07.914
Yeah.

09:07.914 --> 09:10.817
It's okay to be wrong sometimes.

09:10.817 --> 09:13.453
I know that she wants me
to be knocked down a peg

09:13.453 --> 09:15.855
so that I will crumble
and then give her the part,

09:15.855 --> 09:16.956
and that's not happening.

09:16.956 --> 09:20.193
So right now
we don't have anybody

09:20.193 --> 09:22.028
-looking at Mama Z.
-For Mama Z, yeah.

09:22.028 --> 09:25.598
I mean, I think it's only fair
that one of you takes Mama Z,

09:25.598 --> 09:27.934
if you're both so set
on getting Saltine.

09:27.934 --> 09:29.436
Saltine has loads of lines,

09:29.436 --> 09:31.004
and I feel like I'm gonna
have no problem with that.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.972
You sure aren't, because
you're not gonna have them.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.376
We'll just have
to watch and see.

09:36.376 --> 09:39.846
What the fuck, Bosco?
Like, it's rude, honestly.

09:39.846 --> 09:45.051
Lady Camden is more versatile
to pull off Saltine or Mama Z.

09:45.051 --> 09:47.754
I don't know if I could
make Mama Z work.

09:47.754 --> 09:48.822
Telling me I could do both,

09:48.822 --> 09:49.923
I just don't feel
like that's fair,

09:49.923 --> 09:51.858
to, like, sway me that way,
you know?

09:51.858 --> 09:54.527
I'm getting the role
of fucking Saltine,

09:54.527 --> 09:57.263
and they're gonna have to drag
my goddamn body out of here

09:57.263 --> 09:58.765
before I leave without it.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.304
We're literally
just wasting time, guys.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.438
Yeah.

10:12.378 --> 10:13.913
Since neither of us are budging,

10:13.913 --> 10:15.548
so I feel like we're gonna
have to flip a coin for it.

10:15.548 --> 10:17.350
-Yeah.
-Mm.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.719
I would like to see
what the room thinks,

10:19.719 --> 10:21.120
if we could do a vote.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.489
Okay.

10:22.489 --> 10:25.592
And see what people
would say for a role.

10:25.592 --> 10:27.560
Or you could close your eyes,
put your hand up--

10:27.560 --> 10:28.995
No, I wanna know.

10:28.995 --> 10:31.698
I don't feel like
a vote is fair.

10:31.698 --> 10:34.501
It's not up to the other queens
to cast this.

10:34.501 --> 10:36.102
I'll go first.

10:36.102 --> 10:39.205
Saltine, I'm seeing Bosco,

10:39.205 --> 10:41.474
because it's something
about Mama Z

10:41.474 --> 10:45.712
that I really think
you would really do well.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.380
I'll keep tally.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.883
Jorgeous?

10:49.883 --> 10:51.451
Um, I would totally see
Lady Camden.

10:51.451 --> 10:54.554
One for one, ladies.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.523
I think Camden is Saltine.

10:56.523 --> 10:57.524
Okay.

10:57.524 --> 10:58.691
Willow.

10:58.691 --> 11:01.127
I don't know.

11:01.127 --> 11:03.196
I can tell you what I think,
and then you--

11:03.196 --> 11:04.197
What do you think?

11:04.197 --> 11:06.199
I think Bosco,
so that ties it.

11:06.199 --> 11:09.369
Oh, fuck you, bitch.
[laughs]

11:09.369 --> 11:11.237
I mean, based off of watching
lip syncs yesterday,

11:11.237 --> 11:12.338
I would have to say Camden.

11:12.338 --> 11:15.475
But Bosco served a lot of sex.

11:15.475 --> 11:18.278
So your final answer?

11:19.512 --> 11:21.514
So suddenly
it's all on my shoulders

11:21.514 --> 11:22.815
who gets this role.

11:22.815 --> 11:25.218
Oh, my God, one of you
is gonna hate me.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.219
You're the RuPaul,
so what's the tea, girl?

11:26.219 --> 11:27.921
I don't want
that responsibility,

11:27.921 --> 11:30.590
because somehow they're gonna
blame it on me if they fail.

11:33.493 --> 11:34.594
So your final answer?

11:34.594 --> 11:36.563
[laughs]

11:36.563 --> 11:37.697
Willow?

11:39.332 --> 11:40.867
Okay, I see them equally
for Saltine,

11:40.867 --> 11:44.737
but for Mama Z,
I do see Camden more.

11:46.339 --> 11:49.242
So your answer is Bosco
for Saltine?

11:49.242 --> 11:51.811
And so my answer would be
Bosco for Saltine.

11:53.479 --> 11:55.682
Ugh, I hate this so much.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.350
I really think I only said Bosco

11:57.350 --> 11:58.885
because I knew Bosco
would take it harder

11:58.885 --> 12:00.086
if she didn't get the role.

12:00.086 --> 12:03.590
So Bosco's Saltine,
final answer?

12:03.590 --> 12:07.894
I don't want
to fuck you over,

12:07.894 --> 12:10.964
but at the same time,
I'm standing my ground,

12:10.964 --> 12:12.432
and I got the majority vote.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.334
You know what?

12:14.334 --> 12:15.935
Fuck all y'all.

12:15.935 --> 12:17.537
You better fucking
turn that shit out,

12:17.537 --> 12:19.072
and if you don't,
I'm gonna be pissed,

12:19.072 --> 12:20.473
because I wanted that part.

12:20.473 --> 12:25.945
That was my opportunity to
stand my ground and be strong,

12:25.945 --> 12:29.949
but I just feel really
disappointed in myself

12:29.949 --> 12:31.918
that I let myself
get pushed over.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.720
You can Venmo me $5.000.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.121
What?

12:35.121 --> 12:37.123
Guys, I don't want
none of this energy

12:37.123 --> 12:38.891
going through
into the rehearsal.

12:38.891 --> 12:41.060
Like, because
it will fuck us up.

12:41.060 --> 12:45.164
Like, I personally would like
to take a quick moment away.

12:45.164 --> 12:47.600
That was intense.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.435
[sighs]

12:52.271 --> 12:57.176
I don't take pleasure in, like,
standing in my friend's way,

12:57.176 --> 12:58.945
but my priority
in this competition is me.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.980
It's all your fault.

13:00.980 --> 13:03.149
[all laugh]
I'm just kidding.

13:03.149 --> 13:04.951
No one is gonna put this on me.

13:06.319 --> 13:07.420
Camden looks pissed.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.422
It's like when
you get in a fight

13:09.422 --> 13:10.623
with your brother or sister

13:10.623 --> 13:11.924
and then you just, like,
go into the other room.

13:11.924 --> 13:14.560
Camden is, like,
I'm going into my corner,

13:14.560 --> 13:16.396
nobody fucking touch me,

13:16.396 --> 13:18.965
and I'll let you all know
when I'm gonna come out.

13:18.965 --> 13:22.635
I really don't like
doing what I just did,

13:22.635 --> 13:26.005
because by nature, I'm a very
accommodating and chill person.

13:26.005 --> 13:27.707
[sighs]

13:27.707 --> 13:29.876
Oh, I'm gonna have to do
some fucking damage control

13:29.876 --> 13:30.977
with Lady after this.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.779
She'll be fine.

13:32.779 --> 13:34.147
You gotta do what you gotta
to get through the competition.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.149
That's what I've been saying
the whole fucking time,

13:36.149 --> 13:38.618
and people were thinking
I was being a bitch about it.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.453
But that's why I said it
from the beginning.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.055
So do what you gotta fucking do.

13:42.055 --> 13:43.623
I take a moment,

13:43.623 --> 13:47.226
sit with the unpleasantness
of fighting with a friend,

13:47.226 --> 13:49.796
let myself feel like an asshole,

13:49.796 --> 13:51.164
and then I move the fuck on.

13:54.033 --> 13:55.702
How you feeling?

13:55.702 --> 13:56.936
I'm okay. How are you?

13:56.936 --> 13:59.205
I'm good.

13:59.205 --> 14:03.443
I just wanna say that
I really do, like, think

14:03.443 --> 14:06.412
that this part
will be sickening for you.

14:06.412 --> 14:08.414
It's just hard
to take comfort from people

14:08.414 --> 14:10.683
when everyone's really cushy
with what they got,

14:10.683 --> 14:13.052
and they're all like,
oh, yeah, this is totally you.

14:13.052 --> 14:14.387
You could do so great at this.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.122
It's, like, no, I don't think
you even think that.

14:16.122 --> 14:18.758
I feel like everyone just is
really happy with what they got.

14:18.758 --> 14:22.028
The part that I have
is not a part that I wanted.

14:22.028 --> 14:25.698
I know what Lady Camden
is going through in this moment,

14:25.698 --> 14:29.035
and it doesn't always feel good
to make the tough decision

14:29.035 --> 14:31.738
or be the bigger person
or whatever.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.206
But that does not mean

14:33.206 --> 14:36.976
that you won't knock the role
that you got out of the park.

14:36.976 --> 14:38.444
And it's hard,
because I feel like

14:38.444 --> 14:41.514
I would just do such a better
job at it, to be honest, but--

14:41.514 --> 14:43.116
-Yeah, I feel the same.
-Yeah.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.150
I feel the same.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.952
I could have murdered
this part, I do.

14:45.952 --> 14:49.489
I feel like it's more me, but
this could possibly be me, too.

14:49.489 --> 14:54.761
So now the name of the game
is making what we have work.

14:54.761 --> 14:55.762
Yeah.

14:55.762 --> 14:57.196
And we've seen you
be very funny.

14:57.196 --> 15:00.433
That's why I think that
this part, you can handle it.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.301
I feel like Angeria
sees something in me

15:02.301 --> 15:04.570
that I don't always see
in myself, honestly.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.672
And when she's saying,
bitch, you can do this,

15:06.672 --> 15:09.842
I'm kind of going...

15:09.842 --> 15:11.177
I think you're right, I can.

15:11.177 --> 15:15.782
I feel like that weird
kind of, like, crazy energy

15:15.782 --> 15:17.183
that I had
when I was doing Freddie.

15:17.183 --> 15:20.787
I feel like I'm gonna bring
some of that kooky weirdness

15:20.787 --> 15:22.455
-to Mama Z.
-I feel like you should, yeah.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.390
You know, there's
a switch in my mind

15:24.390 --> 15:28.461
where I go, I could
never possibly--oh.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.496
Fuck it, I'll do it.
[laughs]

15:30.496 --> 15:32.298
No such thing as small roles.

15:32.298 --> 15:34.066
Only small boobs.

15:34.066 --> 15:36.102
[both laugh]

15:36.102 --> 15:38.805
I'm feeling, like, fine, Bosco.

15:38.805 --> 15:41.440
You can be happy
with the part that you got

15:41.440 --> 15:42.575
and you fought so hard for.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.877
Thank you for cheering me up.

15:44.877 --> 15:47.880
But I'm very capable
of catching up behind you.

15:47.880 --> 15:51.284
Just... watch out.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.491
Wow.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.993
-Whoa!
-Welcome, ladies.

16:00.993 --> 16:02.495
Hello!

16:02.495 --> 16:05.064
Oh, my fucking God.

16:05.064 --> 16:06.866
Leslie Jordan.

16:06.866 --> 16:08.134
This is wild.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.036
My grandma's a giant
Will and Grace fan,

16:10.036 --> 16:13.039
and I used to watch Will
and Grace with her growing up,

16:13.039 --> 16:14.507
and he's so funny.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.976
Four, five, six, seven.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.744
Leslie Jordan's videos

16:18.744 --> 16:21.881
were one of my favorites
getting through quarantine.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.816
It's still March.

16:23.816 --> 16:27.186
How many days in March?

16:27.186 --> 16:28.487
She just says
what's on her mind.

16:28.487 --> 16:29.755
She don't give a fuck.

16:29.755 --> 16:31.490
What are y'all doing?

16:31.490 --> 16:33.993
Screwing? [laughs]

16:33.993 --> 16:36.629
I am gonna be your director

16:36.629 --> 16:39.265
-this week.
-[cheering]

16:39.265 --> 16:41.868
Say hello to Leland,
our composer,

16:41.868 --> 16:45.371
and Miguel Zarate,
our choreographer.

16:45.371 --> 16:46.939
-Hi, ladies.
-Hi!

16:46.939 --> 16:49.942
Now, listen, here's a secret
you may not know.

16:49.942 --> 16:54.347
I was doing drag
in Atlanta before RuPaul.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.548
Oh! Oh, bitch!

16:55.548 --> 16:57.617
Sister!

16:57.617 --> 17:01.888
I was the sweet and petite
Miss Baby Wipes.

17:01.888 --> 17:04.156
[all laugh]

17:04.156 --> 17:08.227
Leland, what do the girls
need to know about Moulin Ru?

17:08.227 --> 17:12.331
The majority of you are on stage
for most of the Rusical,

17:12.331 --> 17:15.434
so you have to stay
in your character

17:15.434 --> 17:18.604
from the second the Rusical
starts to the second it ends.

17:18.604 --> 17:21.240
You better pee beforehand.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.975
[all laugh]
Very important.

17:22.975 --> 17:25.411
Let's just get it started.

17:25.411 --> 17:28.014
-Cool.
-Saltine.

17:28.014 --> 17:30.583
A lot of pressure
is riding on me to impress,

17:30.583 --> 17:34.020
because I just fought like
a fucking animal for this role,

17:34.020 --> 17:35.388
and I gotta deliver.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.924
Saltine, she's the one
that everyone wants

17:37.924 --> 17:39.225
and no one can afford.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.793
Let's just bring that bitch out.

17:40.793 --> 17:44.730
And you're gonna go one and two
and three and four,

17:44.730 --> 17:48.434
five and six and seven
and eight. Beautiful.

17:48.434 --> 17:50.069
-You take direction well.
-Thank you.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.105
As Bosco is picking up
the choreography,

17:53.105 --> 17:55.975
I'm remembering that Bosco
is a talented dancer.

17:55.975 --> 17:58.244
Five and six
and push, push.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.246
-Nice!
-Wow.

18:00.246 --> 18:03.182
I don't want Bosco to do bad.

18:03.182 --> 18:05.017
I just wanna
do better than Bosco.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.919
Angeria as Charisma.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.287
That's right.

18:08.287 --> 18:11.324
Get up there!
It's your turn!

18:11.324 --> 18:14.427
We're gonna start off cute.
One and two.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.295
Then you're gonna go
three and four.

18:16.295 --> 18:18.731
Okay, hold on.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.633
-Three and four.
-Two.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.436
Right.
[all laugh]

18:23.436 --> 18:26.572
Remember you need to be
focusing on lip syncing

18:26.572 --> 18:29.742
and doing the choreography
and playing the character.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.677
You know, there's a lot
to balance in this one.

18:31.677 --> 18:36.349
So what advice would you give
Angeria to learn those moves?

18:36.349 --> 18:39.485
Attaching something to the move
outside of the count.

18:39.485 --> 18:42.855
Like, shake the dice,
lick it up.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.291
Shake the dice and lick it up.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.860
All: Shake the dice
and lick it up.

18:47.860 --> 18:51.931
I know that me and choreography
ain't the best of friends,

18:51.931 --> 18:53.399
but I'm just hoping

18:53.399 --> 18:56.469
I'm able to shake the dice
and lick it up.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.437
Thank you so much.

18:58.437 --> 18:59.839
-Willow!
-Hey.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.107
My Green Fairy.

19:01.107 --> 19:02.775
Here's the gag.

19:02.775 --> 19:06.178
It's a full sequence, and then
it gets so fast that it's funny.

19:06.178 --> 19:07.813
But you actually
have to keep up with it.

19:07.813 --> 19:08.814
Okay, here we go.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.150
Punch and punch
and hit and head.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.652
Punch and punch
and hit and head.

19:13.652 --> 19:16.322
Cute. Five, six, seven,
a little faster.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.057
One and two
and three and four, five--

19:18.057 --> 19:20.393
[all laugh]

19:20.393 --> 19:21.394
She's like, hold up, hold up.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.529
Let's try that again, Willow.

19:23.529 --> 19:26.699
Oh, fuck, what have I
gotten myself into?

19:26.699 --> 19:28.868
Miss Talent!

19:28.868 --> 19:30.236
Yes.

19:30.236 --> 19:32.371
-How tall are you?
-I'm 5'2.

19:32.371 --> 19:33.606
You are not, you liar.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.374
I am!
[all laugh]

19:35.374 --> 19:37.777
There's only one way
to find the truth.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.846
-I'm 4-11.
-Oh, my God!

19:40.846 --> 19:42.715
You're 5'2.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.750
[all laugh]

19:44.750 --> 19:45.785
Before I even
teach you anything,

19:45.785 --> 19:48.054
-I just want you to show me...
-Okay.

19:48.054 --> 19:51.257
what you think Talent
would give.

19:51.257 --> 19:53.192
One. Hey, hey, hey.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.794
Spice it up!
Spice it up!

19:54.794 --> 19:56.262
Yes!

19:56.262 --> 19:57.963
Punch the ghost,
punch the ghost!

19:57.963 --> 19:59.698
[cheers and laughter]

19:59.698 --> 20:00.699
And she's not even
warm yet, okay?

20:00.699 --> 20:03.035
Oh, yes, ma'am.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.470
So when you're working
in a group,

20:04.470 --> 20:06.939
of course you wanna take
as much attention and spotlight

20:06.939 --> 20:09.508
when it's your turn.

20:09.508 --> 20:12.545
But it's also equally important
to blend in with the group

20:12.545 --> 20:14.413
and know how to support
the other cast members.

20:14.413 --> 20:15.648
Absolutely.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.717
Jorgeous is really good
at just randomly dancing,

20:18.717 --> 20:20.019
not choreography.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.821
Two, three, pop.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.589
Oh, shit, wait a minute.

20:23.589 --> 20:24.657
I'm very interested to see

20:24.657 --> 20:26.559
when it comes
to lots of choreography,

20:26.559 --> 20:27.626
one song after another,

20:27.626 --> 20:29.728
how that's gonna retain
in her head.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.397
One, two, three, kick, four,

20:31.397 --> 20:33.599
step, passé, hit, passé, hit.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.101
Nice!

20:35.101 --> 20:38.037
Jorgeous,
your passé is on fire.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.206
[all laugh]

20:40.206 --> 20:41.807
Mama Z.

20:41.807 --> 20:44.376
I'm just gonna throw you
a couple of eights,

20:44.376 --> 20:46.645
and we're just gonna see
where you go with it.

20:46.645 --> 20:49.181
Great. My goal is to really
flip this around

20:49.181 --> 20:52.418
and find some way
to make this character pop.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.487
And eight and--great.

20:54.487 --> 20:55.488
And I'm gonna give you
a little bit more,

20:55.488 --> 20:56.622
because you can handle it.

20:56.622 --> 20:58.891
Miss Camden, she has
that ballet background,

20:58.891 --> 21:01.527
and, bitch, Camden
is eating the arena.

21:01.527 --> 21:02.928
-Wow.
-Whoa.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.230
Rrr!

21:04.230 --> 21:07.199
Mama Z's also, like,
really nitty gritty and rough.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.667
She actually has a beard.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.069
Yeah, okay.

21:10.069 --> 21:12.304
You're so naturally poised
from all the ballet training,

21:12.304 --> 21:14.073
it's gonna have some more grit

21:14.073 --> 21:16.375
and some more masculinity
within the femininity.

21:16.375 --> 21:17.977
So bring more of that
to the table.

21:17.977 --> 21:21.647
Okay. I'm gonna bring
my newfound butchness.

21:21.647 --> 21:23.149
I'm gonna bring
a little bit of Shakespeare,

21:23.149 --> 21:24.783
a little bit of Freddie.
[laughs]

21:24.783 --> 21:27.153
What is happening to me?
I'm becoming a man!

21:27.153 --> 21:28.120
[laughs]

21:28.120 --> 21:29.455
Out and move.

Amazing!

21:37.196 --> 21:39.064
Are y'all shitting yourselves?

21:39.064 --> 21:40.266
I would be.

21:40.266 --> 21:41.867
You're great.
You're phenomenal.

21:41.867 --> 21:43.102
Lady Camden nails it,

21:43.102 --> 21:46.238
so it's up to me
to really deliver

21:46.238 --> 21:48.140
is the only way
to win at this point.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.943
Okay, ladies, so take five,
and when you come back,

21:50.943 --> 21:53.379
I'm gonna teach you
some square dancing moves

21:53.379 --> 21:56.582
that I learned when
I was at the Grand Ole Opry.

21:56.582 --> 21:58.484
-Oh.
-Oh.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.786
Yee-haw.
[all laugh]

22:00.786 --> 22:05.457
The only queen that I'm very,
very concerned about is RuPaul.

22:05.457 --> 22:10.396
Because, honey,
she's gotta make a decision

22:10.396 --> 22:12.498
amongst all these queens,

22:12.498 --> 22:14.099
and I don't know how
that's gonna happen.

22:18.103 --> 22:21.240

22:21.240 --> 22:25.110
Today we debut Moulin Ru,
the Rusical.

22:25.110 --> 22:28.180
America, get ready.
This is going to be epic.

22:29.281 --> 22:31.850
So did you guys rehearse
last night?

22:31.850 --> 22:32.952
Heck, yeah.

22:32.952 --> 22:35.087
Yes, that was a must.

22:35.087 --> 22:38.190
Baby, I have rehearsed
this choreography

22:38.190 --> 22:41.460
over and over and over again.

22:41.460 --> 22:44.430
I got to Debbie Allen
my own self.

22:44.430 --> 22:47.166
I'm telling myself fame costs,

22:47.166 --> 22:52.037
and this is where you
start paying...in sweat!

22:54.406 --> 22:56.942
How are you feeling
after everything, like--

22:56.942 --> 22:59.411
Honestly, after everything,
I feel a little bit embarrassed

22:59.411 --> 23:01.814
that I even, like, went as far

23:01.814 --> 23:04.683
as to, like, start an argument
with someone over it.

23:04.683 --> 23:07.086
I don't like to get messy
and shit,

23:07.086 --> 23:09.655
because I am, after all,
a fucking lady, you know?

23:09.655 --> 23:11.056
[laughs]

23:11.056 --> 23:14.526
I don't know if being stubborn
is, like, worth it to me,

23:14.526 --> 23:17.396
to be, like--
to win an argument.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.632
As much as I wanna, like,

23:19.632 --> 23:20.799
be a loud voice
and put my foot down,

23:20.799 --> 23:22.268
it's not in my nature
to be, like,

23:22.268 --> 23:24.603
a mean, like,
aggressive bitch about it.

23:24.603 --> 23:25.738
You know what I mean?

23:25.738 --> 23:27.906
This might have been
a blessing in disguise,

23:27.906 --> 23:30.876
because I'm really
kind of getting into Mama Z.

23:30.876 --> 23:34.313
It's kind of fun to imagine
that I own this club, you know?

23:34.313 --> 23:35.581
Come to my club!

23:35.581 --> 23:39.118
Pay me money and watch
my bitches dance! [laughs]

23:39.118 --> 23:40.953
There's a way to just
kind of go, okay,

23:40.953 --> 23:44.657
how can you make lemonade
out of juice or whatever it is?

23:44.657 --> 23:45.924
Make lemons out of lemonade.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.359
What?

23:47.359 --> 23:49.395
No! What's the thing?

23:49.395 --> 23:50.496
Make tea out of lemonade.

23:50.496 --> 23:52.698
Yeah.
[all laugh]

23:52.698 --> 23:53.932
I'm excited.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.434
Me, too, my love.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.903
I grew up doing, like,
musicals and plays and stuff.

23:57.903 --> 24:00.139
That's kind of really where
I felt the most comfortable

24:00.139 --> 24:01.240
when I was in school.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.675
I never really got into

24:02.675 --> 24:04.710
that whole musical theater
kind of stuff

24:04.710 --> 24:06.645
because I just think
it's so annoying to me.

24:06.645 --> 24:07.913
Not gonna lie.

24:07.913 --> 24:10.015
What was that, Miss Jorgeous?

24:10.015 --> 24:12.017
It's, like, so, like,
annoying to me, like--

24:12.017 --> 24:13.652
What's annoying about it?

24:13.652 --> 24:16.789
Just, like, the whole singing
and, like, ♪ ah ha ha ♪

24:16.789 --> 24:18.991
All, like,
happy and shit.

24:18.991 --> 24:20.526
It's just like, no.

24:20.526 --> 24:23.462
I don't want none of the musical
theater gays to come after me,

24:23.462 --> 24:26.699
but honestly,
I'm not a fan whatsoever.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.567
Singing all the time,
I'm just like, no.

24:28.567 --> 24:31.303
I like that club ratchet shit.

24:32.504 --> 24:34.206
-Bosco!
-Yeah!

24:34.206 --> 24:37.443
Star of the Moulin Ru.

24:37.443 --> 24:38.877
Are you nervous at all?

24:38.877 --> 24:40.946
No. I don't know.

24:40.946 --> 24:44.983
This just feels like what
I've, like, been working to do.

24:44.983 --> 24:46.819
Didn't you grow up dancing?

24:46.819 --> 24:48.220
I did.
So I grew up

24:48.220 --> 24:51.090
doing, like, tap dancing
when I was younger,

24:51.090 --> 24:53.826
and, like, my grandma was
also my first dance teacher.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.260
Oh, I love that!

24:55.260 --> 24:58.964
She was trained to be a Radio
City Rockette type of thing.

24:58.964 --> 25:00.532
-So she was, like, kicks?
-She was, like, the kicks

25:00.532 --> 25:02.701
and, like, the Fosse
and all that good stuff.

25:02.701 --> 25:04.269
Oh, this is just great for you.

25:04.269 --> 25:05.838
Granny's gonna love this.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.373
I know!

25:07.373 --> 25:10.209
My grandma was very invested
in that dance scene,

25:10.209 --> 25:12.010
so I grew up watching dancers.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.946
I was taught that Ginger Rogers

25:13.946 --> 25:16.415
had to do everything
that Fred Astaire did,

25:16.415 --> 25:18.851
but backwards and in heels.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.320
I always thought that that
was so much more impressive.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.756
I never had, like,
a dance background.

25:23.756 --> 25:25.657
I just did it
in, like, my living room.

25:25.657 --> 25:26.825
That's so wild to me,

25:26.825 --> 25:28.861
because you are such
a fucking good dancer.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.330
Do you know Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon?

25:31.330 --> 25:32.865
-Yeah.
-No.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.032
-No, you don't?
-I don't.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.334
You don't?

25:35.334 --> 25:36.668
Crouching Dragon--

25:36.668 --> 25:37.870
Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon.

25:37.870 --> 25:38.871
-Yeah.
-What is it?

25:38.871 --> 25:40.439
It's a Chinese film.

25:40.439 --> 25:41.640
Yes, and, like,
they do, like, splits

25:41.640 --> 25:42.941
and it's just, like,

25:42.941 --> 25:44.243
they're always, like, moving
and shit and, like--

25:44.243 --> 25:45.377
You'd watch that,
like, a million times.

25:45.377 --> 25:46.779
Yes, when I was younger.

25:46.779 --> 25:50.349
My mom has a video of me,
like, doing it with the sword.

25:50.349 --> 25:52.050
So that's pretty much
how I started

25:52.050 --> 25:53.986
to, like, learn
how to use, like, my body.

25:53.986 --> 25:56.221
I think as gay people,

25:56.221 --> 25:58.390
we teach ourselves
a lot of talents

25:58.390 --> 26:03.028
because we're too scared
to learn in group settings.

26:03.028 --> 26:06.799
Sometimes we're really
self-conscious about things,

26:06.799 --> 26:08.033
so I think it's really cool

26:08.033 --> 26:10.636
that the thing that Jorgeous
is so great at

26:10.636 --> 26:11.804
she taught herself.

26:11.804 --> 26:12.971
I have a similar story.

26:12.971 --> 26:14.506
I actually have never taken
a dance class.

26:14.506 --> 26:15.507
I could tell.

26:15.507 --> 26:17.476
Ooh!

26:17.476 --> 26:18.944

you get one of those,

26:18.944 --> 26:20.612

that shit in, bitch.

26:20.612 --> 26:22.014

Category is Mirror, Mirror.

39:30.835 --> 39:33.871
First up, Lady Camden.

39:33.871 --> 39:34.872
Ross: You know,
if you break a mirror,

39:34.872 --> 39:36.274
you get seven years
of bad tuck.

39:36.274 --> 39:38.042
[all laugh]

39:38.042 --> 39:41.679
Lady Camden: I am serving you
shooting star.

39:41.679 --> 39:43.014
I'm drawing
some inspiration tonight

39:43.014 --> 39:45.049
from The Little Prince.

39:45.049 --> 39:47.652
I am sparkly as fuck.

39:47.652 --> 39:49.721
I feel like a goddess
from outer space

39:49.721 --> 39:52.423
made completely out of gas.

39:52.423 --> 39:55.426
RuPaul: This is Jack Frost's
sister, Jackie Frost.

39:55.426 --> 39:57.061
Eew, Jackie Frost.

39:57.061 --> 39:58.062
RuPaul: Ooh, Jackie.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.998
Michelle: Ooh, Mary.

39:59.998 --> 40:01.232
RuPaul: Bosco.

40:01.232 --> 40:05.036
She's what you call
a chromosexual.

40:05.036 --> 40:08.172
Bosco: My look is Mugler

40:08.172 --> 40:11.342
meets Sorayama
meets Tin Man slam piece.

40:11.342 --> 40:14.712
I'm giving them a whole lot
of Linda Evangelista

40:14.712 --> 40:17.282
meets just, like, the sexiest
little toaster oven

40:17.282 --> 40:18.750
you ever did see.

40:18.750 --> 40:22.654
I am oiled up to the point
that I am my own Slip-n-Slide.

40:22.654 --> 40:25.089
Things are moving.
No foam here.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.692
Ross: You know you're a whore
if you've got mirrored kneepads.

40:27.692 --> 40:30.028
[RuPaul laughs]

40:30.028 --> 40:32.130
RuPaul: Willow Pill.

40:32.130 --> 40:33.965
Ross: Now, this queen
is a real firecracker.

40:33.965 --> 40:36.301
Willow: The inspiration
for this look

40:36.301 --> 40:39.270
was kind of like Elton John,
Joan Jett, and Evel Knievel

40:39.270 --> 40:41.072
getting into
a bunch of fireworks.

40:41.072 --> 40:43.608
It's very, like,
late seventies rock.

40:43.608 --> 40:46.077
I wanna wear this every day

40:46.077 --> 40:48.846
for breakfast, lunch,
dinner, and dessert.

40:48.846 --> 40:51.249
Andra:
She's illegal in 14 states.

40:51.249 --> 40:52.684
RuPaul:
Let's light this bitch up.

40:52.684 --> 40:54.352
Michelle: Okay!

40:54.352 --> 40:55.787
RuPaul: Angeria.

40:55.787 --> 40:58.189
Ross: More like ho-saic.

40:58.189 --> 41:00.158
[all laugh]

41:00.158 --> 41:04.996
Angeria: Baby, I am giving you
a galactic mermaid queen,

41:04.996 --> 41:09.567
adorned in all of these
reflective scales.

41:09.567 --> 41:12.904
So I'm making sure
everything catches the light.

41:12.904 --> 41:15.973
She's giving you
a beautiful side cutout,

41:15.973 --> 41:17.275
so you could
see the shape, honey,

41:17.275 --> 41:18.676
that all the girls be mad at.

41:18.676 --> 41:21.012
I'm catching the eye
from Andra Day, bitch,

41:21.012 --> 41:23.381
and I'm like,
yes, girl, you see it.

41:23.381 --> 41:26.250
Andra: Oh, she's shattering
the ass ceiling.

41:26.250 --> 41:27.985
[all laugh]

41:27.985 --> 41:29.354
RuPaul: Daya Betty.

41:29.354 --> 41:33.057
Ah, she wants
to rock and roll all night.

41:33.057 --> 41:35.059
Michelle:
And party every day.

41:35.059 --> 41:39.297
Daya: I have chosen to do
a Kiss-inspired runway.

41:39.297 --> 41:42.867
I kind of feel like a shiny,
metallic porcupine right now.

41:42.867 --> 41:44.235
The base of this outfit

41:44.235 --> 41:46.804
is actually made
from a reflective vinyl,

41:46.804 --> 41:50.708
so I hope I'm just blinding
the judges at this point,

41:50.708 --> 41:52.076
in a good way, of course.

41:52.076 --> 41:53.878
Ross: She's a queen that
makes you wanna hug her.

41:53.878 --> 41:55.780
[all laugh]

41:55.780 --> 41:57.215
RuPaul: DeJa Skye.

41:57.215 --> 42:01.219
Michelle: Someone's
been self-reflecting.

42:01.219 --> 42:03.888
RuPaul: Yes, honey, you better
narci-sissy that walk.

42:03.888 --> 42:05.223
[all laugh]

42:05.223 --> 42:08.226
DeJa: Am I beautiful?
Yes, I am.

42:08.226 --> 42:11.863
I'm walking out with regalness,
with confidence.

42:11.863 --> 42:15.633
I have a holographic kind of
cage moment with big shoulders.

42:15.633 --> 42:17.769
You know I love big shoulders.

42:17.769 --> 42:22.607
I am serving the evil queen
of the futuristic Glamazonia.

42:22.607 --> 42:25.309
DeJa, you have a little
right there in your teeth.

42:25.309 --> 42:27.478
[all laugh]

42:27.478 --> 42:30.782
RuPaul: Jorgeous
as Liza Mirrelli.

42:30.782 --> 42:32.717
[all laugh]

42:32.717 --> 42:35.019
Jorgeous: This look
is inspired by Miss Cardi B,

42:35.019 --> 42:38.623
and it has a really short,
scissored kind of look.

42:38.623 --> 42:40.591
It's like my ribcage dress.

42:40.591 --> 42:45.096
I'm wearing latex boots,
latex gloves, wet hair.

42:45.096 --> 42:46.564
I wanted to give the judges

42:46.564 --> 42:50.201
something very edgy,
dark, and mysterious.

42:50.201 --> 42:52.036
Bitch, I'm stomping it out.

42:52.036 --> 42:54.605
Ross: Oh, my God,
you guys, she sharted.

42:54.605 --> 42:56.607
Michelle: Ross!

42:56.607 --> 42:58.976
Andra: Ooh, check out
her rearview mirrors.

42:58.976 --> 43:01.612
RuPaul: Yes, honey,
objects in the mirror

43:01.612 --> 43:04.115
might appear smaller
than they actually is.

43:04.115 --> 43:06.417
[all laugh]

43:07.318 --> 43:09.520
Well, ladies,
the reviews are in.

43:09.520 --> 43:12.323
Moulin Ru is a smash hit.

43:12.323 --> 43:14.292
[cheers and applause]

43:14.292 --> 43:19.297
You've proved that you're all
stars with bright futures.

43:19.297 --> 43:21.065
But this is a competition,

43:21.065 --> 43:24.335
so we're gonna have
to split some hairs here

43:24.335 --> 43:28.739
to really decide
who is top and who is bottom.

43:30.741 --> 43:33.244
First up, Lady Camden.

43:33.244 --> 43:34.378
Lady, you had the emcee role,

43:34.378 --> 43:37.682
which can be
sort of a throwaway role,

43:37.682 --> 43:40.117
and establishing a character
can be difficult.

43:40.117 --> 43:42.720
Somehow you did it,

43:42.720 --> 43:45.890
because you were slithering
across that stage

43:45.890 --> 43:48.826
in a way that
I totally knew who you were.

43:48.826 --> 43:50.828
We've kind of been waiting
this whole competition

43:50.828 --> 43:52.763
for you to be able
to show us some ballet,

43:52.763 --> 43:56.000
and you gave us what you do
and what you do so well.

43:56.000 --> 44:00.438
I actually danced for, like,
22 years, so I can recognize.

44:00.438 --> 44:02.440
I'm like, oh, I see the posture,
I see the pointe,

44:02.440 --> 44:04.976
I see the bevel,
and I love this look.

44:04.976 --> 44:07.445
I love the top.

44:07.445 --> 44:08.446
You know I always say that.

44:08.446 --> 44:10.715
[all laugh]

44:10.715 --> 44:13.384
I'm right here, Ross.
[all laugh]

44:13.384 --> 44:16.554
When I go like this,
oh, I love it.

44:16.554 --> 44:17.755
Thank you so much.

44:17.755 --> 44:19.991
Up next, it's Bosco.

44:19.991 --> 44:21.225
Did you ever see
Moulin Rouge?

44:21.225 --> 44:22.426
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

44:22.426 --> 44:24.161
First of all,
you were playing a character,

44:24.161 --> 44:25.963
so I was kind of wishing

44:25.963 --> 44:27.465
that you didn't do
the Bosco eyebrows,

44:27.465 --> 44:30.201
because you weren't Bosco,
you were Saltine.

44:30.201 --> 44:31.602
That already took me out

44:31.602 --> 44:33.004
of a full commitment
to the character.

44:33.004 --> 44:35.673
You could have gone
so much further with it.

44:35.673 --> 44:39.377
Even the sneezes, the way you
were sneezing was too delicate.

44:39.377 --> 44:40.378
It wasn't big enough.

44:40.378 --> 44:42.647
The thing about the Saltine role

44:42.647 --> 44:47.351
is that the story hinges on
her giving that extra something.

44:47.351 --> 44:48.853
It was almost there.

44:48.853 --> 44:51.455
It just wasn't
all the way there.

44:51.455 --> 44:55.126
This is beautiful
in a Mugler type of way.

44:55.126 --> 44:56.527
It's stunning, it's gorgeous,

44:56.527 --> 44:58.496
but I think you know
what I'm gonna say.

44:58.496 --> 45:02.667
This is I think the fourth
corset/panty/thigh-high look.

45:02.667 --> 45:04.101
It's about versatility.

45:04.101 --> 45:06.404
Yeah, okay, we've seen corset
and panties from you before,

45:06.404 --> 45:09.106
but uh, huh...
[all laugh]

45:09.106 --> 45:12.410
I mean, this is perfection.

45:12.410 --> 45:14.111
Thank you.

45:14.111 --> 45:15.513
Don't try to give her
no big pill.

45:15.513 --> 45:17.415
She want a Willow Pill.

45:17.415 --> 45:19.383
Can I tell you
how much I loved you?

45:19.383 --> 45:20.551
Please do!

45:20.551 --> 45:23.120
You were like Michelle Visage
on a first date.

45:23.120 --> 45:24.889
you just kept doing it
over and over and over again.

45:24.889 --> 45:27.692
[all laugh]
I couldn't get enough.

45:27.692 --> 45:31.128
To play a character
whose energy is dwindling

45:31.128 --> 45:33.631
while keeping your energy
ascending at the same time

45:33.631 --> 45:37.001
is not an easy thing to do,
so I was very impressed.

45:37.001 --> 45:38.135
Thank you.

45:38.135 --> 45:39.170
Tonight, I think
this is adorable.

45:39.170 --> 45:41.639
It's really
rocker chic seventies,

45:41.639 --> 45:44.342
Fourth of July celebration.

45:44.342 --> 45:46.477
But mirror, mirror...

45:46.477 --> 45:48.779
I get the mirror, right?
You're wearing reflective pants.

45:48.779 --> 45:52.316
You always manage
to do it uniquely you.

45:52.316 --> 45:53.551
That's a gift.

45:53.551 --> 45:54.552
Thank you.

45:54.552 --> 45:56.287
Up next, Angeria.

45:56.287 --> 45:59.790
Your part in the Rusical
was not the biggest part,

45:59.790 --> 46:01.192
not the flashiest part,

46:01.192 --> 46:03.461
and I saw you keeping
your head above water.

46:03.461 --> 46:06.230
Like, notice me,
notice me, notice me.

46:06.230 --> 46:07.498
And I appreciate that.

46:07.498 --> 46:09.667
It could have been smoother,
but it was really good.

46:11.002 --> 46:13.037
And this look is, you know,
I have no words.

46:13.037 --> 46:15.172
It is perfect.

46:15.172 --> 46:17.074
With you, the word
is always "regal,"

46:17.074 --> 46:18.776
and I think
that's a pageantry thing.

46:18.776 --> 46:21.178
When you're wearing your crown
and you're in your glory,

46:21.178 --> 46:23.748
and that's what I got from this,
and it's just gorgeous.

46:23.748 --> 46:26.283
Drag queens, take note.
At home, this is what you wear.

46:26.283 --> 46:28.119
This is an iconic look for you.

46:28.119 --> 46:29.854
Oh, thank you.

46:29.854 --> 46:31.856
Up next, Daya Betty.

46:31.856 --> 46:33.958
In the Rusical,
you were amazing.

46:33.958 --> 46:36.327
It's one thing
to be technically perfect,

46:36.327 --> 46:37.428
and then it's another thing

46:37.428 --> 46:39.096
to have the perfect
amount of energy,

46:39.096 --> 46:42.667
and you really combined
the two in a magnificent way.

46:42.667 --> 46:44.602
Small parts are a big risk,

46:44.602 --> 46:47.872
because you could just get lost
if you don't nail it,

46:47.872 --> 46:50.908
and you were able to find
the little moments

46:50.908 --> 46:53.411
that just took it
the extra level.

46:53.411 --> 46:55.413
And I love this outfit.

46:55.413 --> 46:57.615
I love how shiny it is.

46:57.615 --> 47:00.217
Of course, I'm a big Kiss fan.

47:00.217 --> 47:02.086
I totally agree with you.

47:02.086 --> 47:03.454
I think you look
really sharp tonight.

47:03.454 --> 47:06.323
Oh, you need to stop it!

47:06.323 --> 47:10.227
Up next, DeJa Skye.

47:10.227 --> 47:12.329
With these kind of
ensemble productions,

47:12.329 --> 47:15.966
you need to really fight
to be seen in these things,

47:15.966 --> 47:17.268
and we were kind of losing you.

47:17.268 --> 47:18.803
-Okay.
-And then the rap came,

47:18.803 --> 47:20.404
and you came to life.

47:20.404 --> 47:22.139
Walking the dancers out
on leashes

47:22.139 --> 47:23.641
just made me so happy inside.

47:23.641 --> 47:26.010
I will probably
practice it at home.

47:26.010 --> 47:27.712
[all laugh]

47:27.712 --> 47:28.813
Let's talk about
your runway look.

47:28.813 --> 47:30.981
I don't get mirror so much.

47:30.981 --> 47:32.850
-Okay.
-It's pretty.

47:32.850 --> 47:35.286
I did wanna go up to you
a few times and just go, unh.

47:35.286 --> 47:37.121
-Right, the dress.
-Yes.

47:37.121 --> 47:39.490
And my eye keeps going
to where it's bunched up.

47:39.490 --> 47:41.092
I don't see much mirror.

47:41.092 --> 47:42.326
It's reflective, I guess.

47:42.326 --> 47:44.095
I'm getting Cher, Sanctuary.

47:44.095 --> 47:45.229
[imitates Cher] Oh!

47:45.229 --> 47:46.630
But I think that
about everything.

47:46.630 --> 47:49.633
[all laugh]

47:49.633 --> 47:52.036
Up next, Jorgeous.

47:52.036 --> 47:53.671
Helloteous.

47:53.671 --> 47:55.106
-You were Talent.
-Yes.

47:55.106 --> 47:57.975
It started off strong. You had
that funny little boom-boom.

47:57.975 --> 47:59.243
That was so funny.

47:59.243 --> 48:02.480
You had that moment,
and then it was like, bye.

48:02.480 --> 48:04.181
You faded away.

48:04.181 --> 48:06.884
And it's weird, because
when you come out here,

48:06.884 --> 48:09.453
nobody can
take their eyes off of you.

48:09.453 --> 48:10.755
We've all said it
week after week.

48:10.755 --> 48:13.057
The other girls are probably
like, okay, we get it.

48:13.057 --> 48:16.393
But when it's not just you,
you fade away.

48:16.393 --> 48:19.563
There was a disconnect
from what your body was doing

48:19.563 --> 48:21.866
and what was on your face.

48:21.866 --> 48:23.934
I don't know
who your character was.

48:23.934 --> 48:27.204
This look is beautiful,
body is beautiful.

48:27.204 --> 48:29.907
I'm so proud of you
not wearing bra and panties.

48:29.907 --> 48:34.779
It's so different for you,
and I encourage you to--all--

48:34.779 --> 48:36.080
to keep challenging yourself

48:36.080 --> 48:38.816
to bring something different
style-wise each week.

48:38.816 --> 48:40.918
Thank you so much.

48:40.918 --> 48:43.888
All right, ladies,
I wanna hear from you.

48:45.256 --> 48:47.525
Who should go home tonight...

48:47.525 --> 48:48.559
Oh, God.

48:48.559 --> 48:49.827
And why?

48:52.129 --> 48:54.331
Starting with Lady Camden.

48:54.331 --> 48:56.433
I feel like everyone's
really fucking strong,

48:56.433 --> 48:59.203
which is annoying.
[laughs] Um...

48:59.203 --> 49:02.673
Purely based off tonight,
I would have to say Bosco.

49:04.108 --> 49:05.376
Bosco.

49:05.376 --> 49:08.512
Based off of tonight's critiques
and track record,

49:08.512 --> 49:10.147
I would say Jorgeous,

49:10.147 --> 49:13.717
because she's been in the bottom
the most out of the girls here.

49:14.718 --> 49:15.753
Willow.

49:15.753 --> 49:17.988
Bosco fought so hard
for this role,

49:17.988 --> 49:20.858
and it should have been
what was expected.

49:20.858 --> 49:23.394
Angeria, same question.

49:23.394 --> 49:24.628
I am gonna say Bosco.

49:26.030 --> 49:28.599
Daya Betty, same question.

49:28.599 --> 49:31.669
I do unfortunately
have to say Bosco as well.

49:31.669 --> 49:33.838
DeJa Skye.

49:33.838 --> 49:35.439
I would have to say Bosco.

49:36.807 --> 49:39.009
-Jorgeous?
-I would have to say Bosco.

49:39.009 --> 49:40.878
She really, really
wanted this role,

49:40.878 --> 49:42.780
and as she was trying to, like,

49:42.780 --> 49:44.515
why she should,
like, win this role,

49:44.515 --> 49:48.319
she was trying
to put Lady Camden down,

49:48.319 --> 49:50.354
and it put a very bad taste
in my mouth.

49:50.354 --> 49:53.424
And also, if we wanna
talk about track record,

49:53.424 --> 49:55.726
she was in the bottom
three times in one episode.

49:59.263 --> 50:01.699
All right, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.

50:01.699 --> 50:04.535
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

50:04.535 --> 50:07.171
the judges and I
will deliberate.

50:08.505 --> 50:10.574
All right, now, just between
us squirrel friends,

50:10.574 --> 50:14.845
I wanna know what you think,
starting with Lady Camden.

50:14.845 --> 50:19.183
Lady Camden in the Rusical
was dynamic, enigmatic.

50:19.183 --> 50:20.184
You couldn't take your eyes--

50:20.184 --> 50:21.352
Wait, what did you just call me?

50:21.352 --> 50:23.020
Sorry. It had to be said.

50:23.020 --> 50:25.589
Couldn't take my eyes
off of Lady Camden.

50:25.589 --> 50:28.559
Wove the whole story together
like a master seamstress.

50:28.559 --> 50:30.027
She performs
at such a high level,

50:30.027 --> 50:32.663
she probably would have
been great at Saltine

50:32.663 --> 50:33.964
or any character
she would have played.

50:33.964 --> 50:37.134
Lady Camden could do that
on Broadway

50:37.134 --> 50:39.069
in Moulin Rouge! The Musical.

50:39.069 --> 50:41.372
-She was that good.
-Yeah.

50:41.372 --> 50:43.073
Bosco.

50:43.073 --> 50:44.074
She was the star of the show,

50:44.074 --> 50:45.609
and all eyes

50:45.609 --> 50:47.978
should be on her
at all times,

50:47.978 --> 50:50.047
and I kept looking away.

50:50.047 --> 50:51.916
I think the problem
with Bosco as Saltine

50:51.916 --> 50:54.718
is she was probably gluten-free.

50:54.718 --> 50:56.720
[RuPaul laughs]

50:56.720 --> 51:00.124
Tonight on the runway,
yes, y'all, she looks amazing,

51:00.124 --> 51:03.160
but I've seen this look
amazingly four times already.

51:03.160 --> 51:05.729
Obviously, I have not
been here the entire time,

51:05.729 --> 51:07.698
but the entire time
she was walking down the runway,

51:07.698 --> 51:09.867
I just kept thinking,
"Beam me up, naughty.

51:09.867 --> 51:11.669
Beam me up, naughty."
I just love it.

51:11.669 --> 51:13.103
Willow Pill.

51:13.103 --> 51:14.838
Willow came out
middle of the show

51:14.838 --> 51:18.409
and had a really long number
that needed to work,

51:18.409 --> 51:19.977
or we would have been
bored to tears.

51:19.977 --> 51:21.679
And it didn't just work,

51:21.679 --> 51:25.215
it succeeded
on a phenomenal level.

51:25.215 --> 51:27.217
Angeria.

51:27.217 --> 51:28.919
In the challenge,
those smaller parts

51:28.919 --> 51:31.722
can be as much
as you make them.

51:31.722 --> 51:34.325
-Yeah.
-And I think she did a good job,

51:34.325 --> 51:36.460
but I didn't think
she was phenomenal,

51:36.460 --> 51:38.762
and I kind of am used
to her being phenomenal.

51:38.762 --> 51:41.031
But on the runway,
honey, she slayed it.

51:41.031 --> 51:43.300
-Mm-hmm.
-I just love, love, loved it.

51:43.300 --> 51:44.468
Daya Betty.

51:44.468 --> 51:46.870
She was able,
in this teeny-tiny part,

51:46.870 --> 51:49.773
to find things that only existed

51:49.773 --> 51:50.774
because she brought them
to life.

51:50.774 --> 51:53.043
-Mm-hmm.
-I think context is so huge,

51:53.043 --> 51:55.913
and that's really the job of
sort of these side characters,

51:55.913 --> 51:57.948
is to really place you
in the world,

51:57.948 --> 51:59.416
and she really did that for me.

51:59.416 --> 52:01.518
DeJa Skye.

52:01.518 --> 52:02.553
DeJa was Nerve.

52:02.553 --> 52:05.189
I was like, girl power!

52:05.189 --> 52:07.057
Yes, bitch! It was amazing.

52:07.057 --> 52:08.459
When DeJa was rapping,

52:08.459 --> 52:09.693
I was thinking to myself,
she could win this whole week.

52:09.693 --> 52:12.696
And then she comes out in that
on the runway,

52:12.696 --> 52:14.999
and I thought, well,
she foiled that plan.

52:14.999 --> 52:16.633
[all laugh]

52:16.633 --> 52:19.737
I think she had a mirror
challenge and she panicked

52:19.737 --> 52:21.872
and she put something over
a really pretty black dress.

52:21.872 --> 52:23.107
You know, and you try
to sell it with the mirror.

52:23.107 --> 52:24.942
Oh, well, okay.

52:24.942 --> 52:27.011
[all laugh]

52:27.011 --> 52:29.279
-Jorgeous.
-She is a firecracker.

52:29.279 --> 52:30.547
Oftentimes,
for people who are shorter,

52:30.547 --> 52:32.783
it's harder
to command attention.

52:32.783 --> 52:36.253
I have to tell you,
I was jaw-dropped, absolutely.

52:36.253 --> 52:38.922
She was captivating
when it was her turn,

52:38.922 --> 52:42.126
but I didn't get
what her character was

52:42.126 --> 52:43.994
when she wasn't the focal point.

52:43.994 --> 52:46.964
Jorgeous was lost for me
in this entire show.

52:46.964 --> 52:49.833
When she's amongst people
that are as good, if not better,

52:49.833 --> 52:52.136
I think she gets inside of her
head, and that's what happened.

52:52.136 --> 52:53.971
All right, silence.

52:53.971 --> 52:56.240
I've made my decision.

52:56.240 --> 52:58.008
Bring back my girls.

52:59.076 --> 53:01.011
Welcome back, ladies.

53:01.011 --> 53:02.413
I've made some decisions.

53:05.182 --> 53:06.250
Daya Betty.

53:06.250 --> 53:08.819
You made us drunk with laughter.

53:08.819 --> 53:10.354
You are safe.

53:10.354 --> 53:12.589
Thank you guys.
Thank you.

53:15.959 --> 53:17.194
Willow Pill.

53:17.194 --> 53:21.632
This week you were
completely hallelu-cinating.

53:22.933 --> 53:24.368
You are safe.

53:24.368 --> 53:25.836
Thank you.

53:30.340 --> 53:31.608
Lady Camden.

53:31.608 --> 53:34.211
This week
the race was tight,

53:34.211 --> 53:37.014
but you pulled ahead

53:37.014 --> 53:40.451
by a hair
of your chinny-chin-chin.

53:40.451 --> 53:43.120
Con-drag-ulations. You're the
winner of this week's challenge.

53:43.120 --> 53:45.422
-Yay!
-Yes, bitch.

53:45.422 --> 53:46.957
[applause]

53:46.957 --> 53:48.525
I won!

53:48.525 --> 53:49.893
Yes, bitch!

53:49.893 --> 53:52.896
You've won a cash prize
of $5.000,

53:52.896 --> 53:55.599
and a trip to New York City

53:55.599 --> 53:59.236
to see Moulin Rouge!
The Musical on Broadway.

53:59.236 --> 54:00.604
Thank you guys so much.

54:00.604 --> 54:02.673
I can't believe I won!

54:02.673 --> 54:04.741
What feels good about this

54:04.741 --> 54:07.511
is that I didn't win
the fight with Bosco,

54:07.511 --> 54:09.713
I might not have been
the loudest voice in the room,

54:09.713 --> 54:11.615
but I turned
that shit out, bitch.

54:11.615 --> 54:13.283
[laughs]

54:13.283 --> 54:15.285
[whispers]
I'm going to New York!

54:15.285 --> 54:19.256
Angeria, you are safe.

54:19.256 --> 54:22.159
-Thank you.
-You may join the other girls.

54:22.159 --> 54:23.894
Thank you.

54:25.796 --> 54:27.898
Bosco.

54:27.898 --> 54:30.634
Your performance
was nothing to sneeze at,

54:30.634 --> 54:34.338
but the judges wanted to see
even more star quality.

54:34.338 --> 54:36.874
DeJa Skye.

54:36.874 --> 54:40.077
As a rapper, you dominated,

54:40.077 --> 54:44.281
but your mirror, mirror look
did not reflect well on you.

54:44.281 --> 54:46.083
Jorgeous.

54:46.083 --> 54:50.754
You're a true talent,
but you got lost in the chorus.

54:55.425 --> 54:57.828
DeJa Skye, you are safe.

54:57.828 --> 54:59.463
Oh!

55:00.564 --> 55:02.299
You may join the other girls.

55:02.299 --> 55:03.967
Thank you.

55:03.967 --> 55:05.836
-I love you.
-I love you.

55:07.604 --> 55:10.641
Bosco, Jorgeous,

55:10.641 --> 55:14.578
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination.

55:15.779 --> 55:17.814
I do not particularly want

55:17.814 --> 55:19.183
to lip sync against Jorgeous,

55:19.183 --> 55:22.119
and I'm pretty sure that RuPaul
has put herself down

55:22.119 --> 55:24.121
as an organ donor for Jorgeous.

55:24.121 --> 55:25.856
Like, she's obsessed
with Jorgeous,

55:25.856 --> 55:29.626
but I need to continue going
forward in this competition.

55:29.626 --> 55:33.163
Two queens stand before me.

55:33.163 --> 55:37.434
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

55:37.434 --> 55:42.706
and save yourself
from elimination.

55:44.875 --> 55:46.977
The time has come...
[thunder]

55:46.977 --> 55:50.447
for you to lip sync...

55:50.447 --> 55:53.617
[echoing] for your life!

55:56.486 --> 55:58.789
Okay, this isn't my first time
at the rodeo.

55:58.789 --> 56:01.925
Lip syncing is what I do,
and I'm ready to turn it.

56:01.925 --> 56:07.297
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

56:07.297 --> 56:10.934
This is
the Heartbreak Hotel.

56:10.934 --> 56:15.305

Jorgeous, shantay you stay.

58:25.535 --> 58:26.536
You may join the other girls.

58:26.536 --> 58:28.572
Thank y'all so much.

58:28.572 --> 58:29.806
Thank y'all.

58:34.644 --> 58:35.645
Bosco.

58:38.482 --> 58:42.386
Your fate now rests
in the hands of the drag gods.

58:43.587 --> 58:48.091
If you have the gold bar,
you will be safe.

58:50.427 --> 58:52.295
Now let's see what you've got.

59:05.075 --> 59:06.843
Oh, my goodness!

59:06.843 --> 59:09.613
[cheers and applause]

59:15.085 --> 59:17.721
You've got the gold bar!

59:17.721 --> 59:20.991
[cheering]

59:20.991 --> 59:24.227
The drag gods have spoken!

59:26.029 --> 59:28.198
Bosco, con-drag-ulations.

59:28.198 --> 59:31.768
You are safe
to slay another day!

59:31.768 --> 59:34.538
[cheering]

59:34.538 --> 59:39.242
Oh, my God, to be given
a second chance is wild.

59:39.242 --> 59:42.579
And to be given a second chance
that wasn't even from RuPaul,

59:42.579 --> 59:45.649
it was just from the universe,
is insane.

59:45.649 --> 59:48.552
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

59:48.552 --> 59:51.021
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

59:51.021 --> 59:53.256
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

59:53.256 --> 59:55.025
Can I get an "amen" up in here?

59:55.025 --> 59:56.059
-Amen!
-Amen!

59:56.059 --> 59:59.763
All right.

We're having a good,
old-fashioned roast,

1:00:16.546 --> 1:00:22.252
and the guest of honor
is our very own Ross Mathews.

1:00:22.252 --> 1:00:23.320
[cheering]

1:00:23.320 --> 1:00:25.355
When I think of the name
Ross Mathews,

1:00:25.355 --> 1:00:26.690
I think of motels:

1:00:26.690 --> 1:00:28.892
always open
and filthy as fuck.

1:00:28.892 --> 1:00:30.627
[both laugh]

1:00:30.627 --> 1:00:32.229
Last week
I had the dubious honor

1:00:32.229 --> 1:00:34.865
of being told
that I should go home.

1:00:34.865 --> 1:00:36.399
Cool.

1:00:38.468 --> 1:00:39.970
There's no punchline
to that joke.

1:00:39.970 --> 1:00:42.072
It doesn't matter
if you just won

1:00:42.072 --> 1:00:43.073
or you almost went home.

1:00:45.575 --> 1:00:47.811
