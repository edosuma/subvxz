WEBVTT

00:52.136 --> 00:53.137
Shh!

01:35.972 --> 01:38.516
- You sure nobody wants a sandwich?
- I do.

01:38.683 --> 01:41.686
No, thanks. Not one of
your jaw-stretcher specials.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.521
Mmm.

01:44.480 --> 01:47.191
- Let's see, now, more bologna?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:47.358 --> 01:49.944
- And some more meatloaf?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:50.111 --> 01:53.572
And a slug of double
Dutch chocolate syrup.

01:53.739 --> 01:56.284
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.413
Oh, swell.

02:00.579 --> 02:01.872
We're out of gas.

02:02.164 --> 02:04.917
Like, what a creepy place
to run out of gas.

02:05.084 --> 02:08.129
What are we gonna do?
There isn't a gas station for miles.

02:08.421 --> 02:10.131
Hey, look. There's a farmhouse.

02:10.548 --> 02:12.300
Maybe we can get some gas there.

02:12.550 --> 02:14.760
It's worth a try. Come on.

02:17.013 --> 02:20.057
- Like, nobody home.
- Get off of my property!

02:20.308 --> 02:23.686
I'm sick of you reporters
pestering me night and day!

02:23.853 --> 02:27.231
- Now, get!
- Reporters? We're not reporters.

02:27.565 --> 02:28.983
No.

02:29.275 --> 02:31.235
We just wanna buy some gasoline.

02:31.527 --> 02:33.863
Gas, huh? I don't believe you.

02:34.030 --> 02:36.490
Now, get on out of here,
the lot of you!

02:36.782 --> 02:40.578
Excuse me, sir. But why would
reporters wanna bother you?

02:40.911 --> 02:44.248
They've been running me ragged
ever since it showed up.

02:44.457 --> 02:45.833
"It"? What's "it"?

02:46.125 --> 02:49.086
A ghostly craft from another world...

02:49.253 --> 02:52.506
moving across the sky
like an evil spirit.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.925
Evil spirit?

02:55.176 --> 02:57.928
You mean, like a haunted
flying saucer?

02:58.095 --> 02:59.847
Right. But that's not all.

03:00.014 --> 03:04.101
Something's been creeping around
here ever since it showed up.

03:04.518 --> 03:08.022
Then it must have just crept by.
Look over there.

03:08.397 --> 03:10.983
- Footprints.
- Zoinks!

03:11.192 --> 03:13.819
I've never seen footprints
like those before.

03:14.111 --> 03:17.531
I see them all the time.

03:17.907 --> 03:20.242
They sure are
strange-shaped tracks.

03:20.409 --> 03:23.954
- Let's us make tracks the other way.
- I'm with you.

03:24.914 --> 03:26.707
Hold it.

03:27.458 --> 03:29.126
They're gone.

03:29.293 --> 03:31.295
Ghostly flying objects...

03:31.462 --> 03:34.173
strange tracks
that glow in the dark...

03:34.340 --> 03:38.135
And something creepy
creeping around in the night.

03:38.344 --> 03:40.137
OW!

03:40.304 --> 03:44.058
He got me! He got me! He got me!

03:45.142 --> 03:48.354
Help! He got me!

03:51.482 --> 03:55.861
You big chicken, it was only
a chicken. Get down.

03:57.988 --> 04:00.366
Those footprints weren't made
by a chicken.

04:00.658 --> 04:03.494
It looks like we've found ourselves
a mystery.

04:06.956 --> 04:09.500
Sure was nice of that farmer
to give us some gas.

04:09.667 --> 04:12.336
Yeah, now we can go look
for that ghost craft.

04:17.716 --> 04:20.761
Well, you don't have to look
any further. There it is.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.683
Zoinks!
What a creepy-looking crate.

04:28.185 --> 04:30.521
We're in luck.
It landed behind that hill.

04:30.855 --> 04:34.608
Yeah, we're in luck.
And, like, it's all bad.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.236
Oh!

04:38.154 --> 04:40.781
It looked like it landed
somewhere around here.

04:41.115 --> 04:42.908
What is this place, anyway?

04:43.826 --> 04:47.580
Looks like it's an old abandoned
airfield. Hasn't been used for years.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.707
I'm for abandoning it too.

04:49.874 --> 04:51.917
It's, like, got the creeps.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.754
Do you guys see what I see?

04:56.046 --> 04:58.674
It's those spooky
glowing tracks again.

04:58.841 --> 05:00.384
Oh, no.

05:00.551 --> 05:02.761
It's our first Clue. Let's follow them.

05:03.095 --> 05:04.555
Let's don't and say we did.

05:04.722 --> 05:07.057
But the gate's locked.
How will we get in?

05:09.101 --> 05:10.394
Ghosts!

05:10.561 --> 05:13.564
You mean wind. The gate
wasn't locked. Come on.

05:17.860 --> 05:19.862
Zoinks! What's that?

05:20.029 --> 05:22.156
I'll bet it's the outer space ghost.

05:22.323 --> 05:25.659
That's it. That's it.
I'm staying right here.

05:25.826 --> 05:29.330
- Me too.
- Okay, if you wanna stay here alone.

05:33.959 --> 05:38.214
Hey, wait for us!

05:43.844 --> 05:45.429
The tracks go into that old shed.

05:45.596 --> 05:48.265
Fine. Now we know, let's go.

05:48.432 --> 05:51.393
- What's that funny noise?
- Let's go inside.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.145
Hold it.

05:53.354 --> 05:56.440
- Let's settle for a peek inside.
- What do you see?

05:56.607 --> 06:00.945
It's Scooby.
How did he get in there?

06:01.111 --> 06:02.947
Hey, Scooby, I'm glad you're out.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.907
- What did you see?
- Nothing.

06:05.074 --> 06:08.953
- You mean the shed is empty?
- The window's too dirty to see through.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.455
- Come on.
- Look at that.

06:11.622 --> 06:13.624
The tracks vanish right at the door.

06:13.791 --> 06:16.794
I see something. A generator.

06:16.961 --> 06:18.295
And it's still warm.

06:18.462 --> 06:21.131
I'll bet you that's what
that humming sound was.

06:21.298 --> 06:24.677
But who would be running a
generator on an abandoned airfield?

06:24.885 --> 06:25.928
I don't know.

06:27.388 --> 06:29.765
Zoinks! There's that sound again.

06:29.932 --> 06:31.809
It's the weirdo spaceship.

06:32.601 --> 06:36.188
And it looks like it's
coming down close to here.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.816
- What'll we do now?
- Come on.

06:38.983 --> 06:43.320
Let's split up and see if we can find
this mysterious ghost from space.

06:47.700 --> 06:51.662
Like, wow, we always find
the scariest things.

06:51.829 --> 06:54.707
But there's no use being scared
on an empty stomach.

06:55.165 --> 06:59.670
Have a peanut.
Take two. They're small.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.384
Good.

07:05.551 --> 07:07.386
Well, okay, wise guy...

07:07.553 --> 07:09.680
let's see you try that one again.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.350
- Just try it.
- Scooby-Doo!

07:24.236 --> 07:26.030
Zoinks! The ghost!

07:35.247 --> 07:38.709
Hold your breath
and don't move a muscle.

07:52.222 --> 07:54.016
Pilot to copilot...

07:54.183 --> 07:57.728
I got an idea.
Release the life raft.

07:58.020 --> 07:59.730
Right.

08:10.074 --> 08:12.534
Well, it wasn't the easiest escape...

08:12.701 --> 08:14.078
but we lost him.

08:17.414 --> 08:20.876
I hope Shaggy and Scooby
are having more luck.

08:21.043 --> 08:23.295
Shall we look in here?

08:23.921 --> 08:25.589
It looks like a shop.

08:25.756 --> 08:28.258
Go on in, Freddy. Let's look around.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.808
Let's get out of here. It's all greasy.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.268
Wait a minute.
That's a clue right there.

08:38.435 --> 08:41.438
- What do you mean?
- This is fresh grease.

08:41.605 --> 08:44.316
And these tools
have all been used recently.

08:46.318 --> 08:47.945
Hey, hold it!

08:48.112 --> 08:50.280
Freddy, what's happening?

08:50.447 --> 08:53.283
How should I know?
Just get me down from here.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.577
- But how?
- Look for a button...

08:55.744 --> 08:57.621
or a lever that works the hoist.

08:57.830 --> 08:59.998
What would
the button look like, Freddy?

09:00.165 --> 09:02.626
Velma, surely you can figure it out.

09:02.793 --> 09:05.462
Mechanics aren't my cup of tea,
Freddy.

09:05.629 --> 09:08.465
Well, find Shaggy and Scooby,
then, and hurry.

09:08.632 --> 09:10.968
I just hope we can find them.

09:11.135 --> 09:13.637
I feel like a side of beef.

09:14.805 --> 09:17.015
I wonder where Freddy
and the girls are.

09:17.182 --> 09:21.145
We got to warn them about
Ghost Man. Might as well look in here.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.982
What's that?

09:25.149 --> 09:26.650
Let's get out of here!

09:29.653 --> 09:31.488
Shaggy?

09:31.655 --> 09:33.699
Ghosts!

09:34.116 --> 09:36.994
- Where?
- There.

09:37.161 --> 09:41.165
- Ghosts!
- Where? Ghosts!

09:43.792 --> 09:45.502
- Velma, look.
- Hey, wait a minute.

09:45.669 --> 09:47.629
One of those ghosts has paws.

09:50.174 --> 09:53.385
Oh, hi. We were just
looking for you two.

09:53.594 --> 09:58.515
- We could see that as you ran past us.
- You must have soared yourselves silly.

09:58.682 --> 10:02.352
- Where's Freddy?
- You might say Freddy got hung up.

10:02.519 --> 10:05.647
Come on. We've got to hurry back
and get him down.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.692
Lucky we got you down, Freddy.

10:08.859 --> 10:12.738
Like, you might have
scared the ghost away.

10:15.407 --> 10:18.660
Never mind the jokes.
What about this thing you saw?

10:18.827 --> 10:21.371
Yes, your description
was pretty vague.

10:21.538 --> 10:26.210
Well, you might say
it looked exactly like that.

10:30.130 --> 10:34.218
Zoinks! That's him! Get lost!

10:34.384 --> 10:38.555
In a case like this, Shag and Scoob
did exactly the right thing.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.891
Let's scram.

10:51.944 --> 10:54.571
Hold it! Hit the binders!

10:54.988 --> 10:58.784
"Mess hall"? Never heard
of a special place to make a mess.

10:58.951 --> 11:02.329
But it's my kind of place to hide.
Come on.

11:02.496 --> 11:06.375
Heck, Scooby, this isn't a mess hall.
It's a kitchen.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.627
And a kitchen means...

11:08.794 --> 11:10.087
Food!

11:10.254 --> 11:12.506
And, man, am I starved.

11:12.673 --> 11:16.176
But even if we find something,
it'll probably be stale and no good.

11:16.510 --> 11:20.430
Oh, well, it won't do any harm
to look, anyway.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.767
Nothing.

11:27.521 --> 11:30.023
Find anything, Scoob?

11:32.651 --> 11:35.237
Hey, Scoob, did you find anything?

11:44.997 --> 11:47.541
So you did find something.

11:47.916 --> 11:50.043
- Olive?
- One olive?

11:50.210 --> 11:53.422
Oh, well, it's better than just a pit.

11:53.630 --> 11:57.050
Hey, what's all this?
Ham and chicken bones?

11:57.342 --> 11:59.511
Scooby, I think you've given us...

11:59.678 --> 12:01.889
another good clue
to this whole mystery.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.724
- Clue?
- Yeah.

12:03.891 --> 12:08.520
Like, how come a ghost from space
keeps chicken and ham around?

12:08.687 --> 12:11.106
- Right.
- Let's go tell the others.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.908
Zoinks! It's it again!

12:21.074 --> 12:22.826
Let's get!

12:27.039 --> 12:28.749
Find a place to hide.

12:56.693 --> 13:00.697
Trying to make a clean getaway,
huh, Scooby?

13:07.287 --> 13:10.958
- Yikes!
- Yikes! Gangway!

13:15.545 --> 13:19.049
There's another hangar check
that didn't give us a single new clue.

13:19.216 --> 13:21.969
I wish I knew where
Shaggy and Scooby were.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.179
They're supposed to be helping us.

13:24.346 --> 13:26.473
I wish I knew where that ghost was.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.476
Let's keep going. Hold it.

13:29.726 --> 13:32.354
There's something in that barrel.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.983
A newspaper. But what makes
those little dots glow?

13:36.149 --> 13:40.153
That's the same kind of a glow
as those strange footprints we saw.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.990
Hold this like
you were reading it, Freddy.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.993
How do you like that?
Glowing fingerprints.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.328
And look at the story
that's been circled.

13:48.495 --> 13:53.709
"Mysterious ghost craft reported
near abandoned air field."

13:53.875 --> 13:55.168
Here's something else.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.213
- That's yesterday's newspaper.
- I don't get it.

13:58.380 --> 14:02.968
Why would a ghost from outer space
be reading yesterday's newspaper?

14:06.513 --> 14:09.307
I guess we gave that ghost
the slip for now.

14:11.518 --> 14:14.771
We gotta sneak past Mr. Creepy
and find Freddy and the girls.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.857
Come on.

14:27.617 --> 14:28.702
Shh!

14:30.579 --> 14:33.040
I said, "Shh."

14:33.373 --> 14:34.875
Not me, him.

14:38.503 --> 14:41.423
That's our cue to skidoo.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.052
Quick, Scooby, put this key
in a safe place.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.887
Right.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.476
Oh, no, another door.

14:54.936 --> 14:59.816
Old Frightening Face won't be
able to open the door now.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.529
Oh, no. It opened the other way.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.406
YikeS!

15:06.656 --> 15:10.410
- Quick, Scoob, give me the key.
- The key?

15:12.746 --> 15:17.084
You threw it out the window?

15:17.417 --> 15:21.004
We gotta get that key
and get out of here.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.256
- There it is.
- Got it.

15:26.218 --> 15:28.845
Now we can get out of here.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.106
I'm getting worried.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.734
We haven't seen hide nor long hair
of Shaggy or Scooby.

15:42.901 --> 15:45.529
I hope they didn't run into
that ghost again.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.864
Look at the side of that hangar.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.617
Whatever it is,
there's two of them this time.

15:50.951 --> 15:53.703
Don't just stand there.
Let's get out of here.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.872
- Hey, why are they running?
- Look.

15:56.123 --> 15:59.376
They got scared of our shadows.

15:59.793 --> 16:04.464
That's not you or me, Scooby.
Hey, wait for us!

16:06.800 --> 16:10.387
Hey, Shaggy, here we are!

16:11.012 --> 16:14.975
Boy, we're sure glad to see you guys.
What did you find out?

16:15.267 --> 16:18.645
We still don't have any Clues
as to what that ghost craft is...

16:18.812 --> 16:20.814
that's flying around in the air.

16:20.981 --> 16:24.526
Or Old Mr. Creepy who keeps
popping up all over the place.

16:24.776 --> 16:27.737
Well, it seems to me that our ghost
from outer space...

16:27.904 --> 16:31.491
is using this airfield for
something else besides haunting.

16:34.286 --> 16:36.454
What's the matter, Scoob?

16:36.621 --> 16:39.916
- Gasoline.
- There's gas in the exhaust pipe?

16:40.083 --> 16:43.712
- In this old relic?
- By golly, it's a clue, all right.

16:44.129 --> 16:47.966
- This motor's been running recently.
- But it couldn't possibly run.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.968
It's got four flat tires.

16:50.135 --> 16:52.762
Maybe that's what someone
wants us to believe.

16:53.013 --> 16:55.515
Get a load of this.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.684
Like, an extra set of wheels.

16:57.934 --> 17:01.897
Instead of getting Clearer, this
mystery's getting cloudier all the time.

17:03.773 --> 17:06.735
Zoinks! A ghost jeep!

17:12.699 --> 17:16.453
Look, it's that goony ghost
from outer space.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.000
Jumping jellybeans!
There's a whole army of them.

17:22.167 --> 17:25.545
Yeah, and I'm gonna show them
a good old Army maneuver.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.464
Retreat!

17:27.714 --> 17:30.133
Quick, in here.

17:35.639 --> 17:40.227
Well, I'll be. Looks like we
struck real pay dirt, Scoob.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.895
Look at that equipment.

17:42.062 --> 17:45.565
And I'll bet you that mike is
hooked up to loudspeakers...

17:45.732 --> 17:48.568
- on this crazy old airfield.
- Wow.

17:48.735 --> 17:53.156
We'd better get Freddy and
the girls up here on the double.

17:55.867 --> 17:59.287
- What is that?
- That has to be Scooby.

17:59.537 --> 18:02.415
They must've found something
up in the tower. Let's go.

18:02.624 --> 18:06.461
- I hope we're not too late. Look.
- Oh, no.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.255
Let's run for it.

18:08.505 --> 18:12.175
They got the message.
Here comes Freddy and the girls.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.427
Look!

18:14.594 --> 18:16.680
Here comes Mr. Trouble too.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.435
Those chairs won't keep him
out of here, Scooby.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.562
We'd better think of something else.

18:24.729 --> 18:26.064
Ahh!

18:26.940 --> 18:28.858
- Parachute?
- Parachute?

18:29.025 --> 18:31.027
Only as a last resort.

18:31.194 --> 18:33.071
A very last resort.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.866
The ghost!

18:39.786 --> 18:43.373
We're too late. That ghost has
gotten to Shaggy and Scooby first.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.917
- Oh, no.
- Don't jump!

18:46.084 --> 18:50.297
Geronimo!

18:51.798 --> 18:54.217
Well, we're glad we found you.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.511
What are you doing here,
Mr. Farmer?

18:56.678 --> 19:00.223
I got worried about you when I saw
your car parked by the gate.

19:00.390 --> 19:03.143
- That's when I called the sheriff.
- I'm glad he did.

19:03.310 --> 19:06.438
It's high time we got to the bottom
of these shenanigans.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.481
Sheriff, look. He's getting away.

19:11.484 --> 19:15.655
I think our glowing friend
just made a bad mistake. Come on.

19:20.243 --> 19:22.287
- He ran in that door.
- What is it?

19:22.454 --> 19:24.414
Wind tunnel. This ought to be good.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.167
Start it up, Freddy.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.505
Now take a look at our ghost
from outer space.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.884
He was wearing rubber boots
to make those strange tracks.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.844
Dipped in phosphorus, no doubt.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.847
You can, like, shut it off, Fred.

19:41.264 --> 19:44.642
He's had enough
of being a space ghost.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.688
Well, I don't believe it.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.524
It's Henry Bascomb,
my next-door neighbor.

19:51.733 --> 19:54.694
But what about those weird noises
and the flying thing?

19:54.861 --> 19:56.446
Come on, I'll show you.

19:57.822 --> 20:01.117
It was a very clever plan.
Here's our ghost craft.

20:01.284 --> 20:04.537
- Like, home movies.
- But what about those odd voices?

20:04.704 --> 20:09.042
- It was just a speeded-up soundtrack.
- Played over the loudspeaker.

20:09.209 --> 20:12.879
But we did see a whole bunch of those
creepies over by the motor pool.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.382
Wanna bet they're all
stuffed dummies?

20:15.548 --> 20:19.302
And you wanna bet that crazy jeep
was run by remote control?

20:19.552 --> 20:22.722
The last remaining puzzle
in my mind is, why?

20:22.889 --> 20:25.558
I can answer that.
This Bascomb fellow got wind...

20:25.725 --> 20:28.937
that the Air Force was planning
to open the field again...

20:29.145 --> 20:31.398
and would be needing
more land for jets.

20:31.773 --> 20:34.943
Aha! So that's it.
He wanted to scare us off...

20:35.151 --> 20:37.112
so he could pick up
the land cheap.

20:37.278 --> 20:40.740
And I'd have done it too,
if you kids hadn't come along.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.576
Weren't you kids scared,
like the rest of us?

20:43.743 --> 20:46.913
Oh, no. Solving mysteries
is our hobby.

20:47.080 --> 20:50.333
It takes a lot to scare us.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.296
Yikes! Help! Help! Save me!

20:55.463 --> 20:57.924
They're back! Those creeps
are back again!

20:58.091 --> 21:00.510
Help!

21:04.681 --> 21:07.267
Scooby-Doo.

21:59.402 --> 22:00.403
Shh!
