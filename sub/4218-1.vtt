WEBVTT

00:02.795 --> 00:09.217
House fire,
788 Maple Street. Engine 51,
Truck 81, Ambulance 61.

00:18.727 --> 00:24.315
Hey, guys. How do I look?
As usual.
Like the class clown.

00:26.902 --> 00:30.488
Yo, Severide.
How soon until you can take
Darden off my hands?

00:31.740 --> 00:34.867
Andy makes Squad the day after
I'm no longer in charge.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.719
The attic,
My brother lives up there...
He hasn't come down...

00:52.886 --> 00:55.638
That window there?
Yes... I haven't seen him...
Oh, God...

00:55.806 --> 00:56.889
We think there's a guy
in the attic.

00:57.057 --> 01:00.601
I'll raise the aerial.
He could be on the stairs,
in the hallway, anywhere.

01:00.769 --> 01:03.062
We'll go in the back,
work our way up.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.606
Case of beer
we get to him first...
Just vent the back.

01:06.608 --> 01:09.819
Was Severide
always such a cocky prick?
Only since kindergarten.

01:16.660 --> 01:17.952
This is Chief Boden.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.663
I want an inch and
three-quarter in the front,
and two two-and-a-half's

01:20.831 --> 01:24.917
in the neighbor's houses.
Vent in the rear and
ground ladders to the roof.

01:26.170 --> 01:29.464
I'll get it. Let's go!

01:33.969 --> 01:35.470
Hey! Check over there!

01:35.637 --> 01:38.347
Severide, do we have a vent?
Darden, wait!

01:38.515 --> 01:40.892
We're good!

01:42.186 --> 01:45.396
Casey, there is no vent!
Darden, back out!

01:50.903 --> 01:53.863
Get down!

01:56.909 --> 01:58.576
Darden!

02:40.369 --> 02:42.453
What the hell
are you doing, Casey?

02:42.621 --> 02:46.582
I can't stand looking at this
another day.
Heather might want it.

02:52.005 --> 02:55.007
Yeah.
I'll call her.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.759
Boden's looking
for you.

03:07.771 --> 03:10.273
Casey.
Want to step into
my office?

03:10.440 --> 03:13.901
Rumor's floating around you're
gonna box in the Drop-A-Cop...

03:14.069 --> 03:15.736
Fight that guy who slept with
your first wife...

03:15.904 --> 03:18.239
It was my second wife,
and she's his problem now,
not mine.

03:18.407 --> 03:19.782
So, no, I'm not boxing.

03:27.833 --> 03:31.544
Mayor Emanuel's coming
by on Saturday to mark the
month since Darden...

03:36.091 --> 03:39.427
This animosity...
it's got to stop.

03:39.595 --> 03:42.972
You're both supposed to be
leaders here. Lead by example.
We've all been through it.

03:43.140 --> 03:46.434
Andy was a friend
to all of us.
Yeah, he was.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.102
Is there something
you want to say?

03:48.270 --> 03:49.770
See, this?
This right here.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.188
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

03:55.319 --> 03:59.906
You're right, Chief.
I'm sorry.
It's all good.

04:03.285 --> 04:04.785
We're fine, Chief.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.374
Then that's enough for now.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.972
Hey. I'm...

04:25.140 --> 04:29.518
I'm... My name is Peter Mills.
I'm the new candidate on 81.

04:29.686 --> 04:33.564
Oh, fantastic! Joe Cruz.
We've been waitin' for you!
Really? Great.

04:33.732 --> 04:35.816
So, Peter Mills, is it?
Pete, actually. I...

04:35.984 --> 04:39.570
Okay. Peter Mills.
Right this way.
So, gym's through there...

04:39.738 --> 04:42.365
Uh, there's a TV
in the kitchen,
but the satellite's busted.

04:42.532 --> 04:45.785
Uh, equipment room,
Rescue Squad A-holes,

04:45.953 --> 04:49.080
they think they own
that table.
Kitchen, tower.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.419
Hey, Mills, keep moving!
Yeah.

05:01.927 --> 05:05.221
Hey, Otis,
this is Peter Mills.
Yeah. I'm giving a tour.

05:05.389 --> 05:07.014
Peter Mills is our new
candidate.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.894
Peter Mills...
she's all yours.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.987
Um...
who wants to try on a helmet?

05:22.531 --> 05:25.574
Firehouse 51,
Ambulance 61.
Multiple gunshot injuries.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.702
934 Rosedale Road.

05:31.039 --> 05:34.625
What's up?
Two GSWs, one's an organ
donor, another hit in the gut.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.794
The shooter?
Gone, but this happened
less than ten minutes ago.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.212
We're sweeping.

05:46.388 --> 05:49.557
Oh, God. Oh, God.

05:49.725 --> 05:51.100
What's your name?
Ricky.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.728
You buying or selling, Ricky?
Bitch, just fix me up.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.563
Maybe we should let him
bleed a while.

05:55.731 --> 05:57.898
I put one in that GD.
Hit him right in the head.

05:58.066 --> 06:01.027
Yeah? I don't think so, Ricky.
He's gone.
Naw, man, I hit him.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.488
Hey, we think
the shooter's upstairs.
Okay, we're good here.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.991
Ricky, have you been using?
Hmm?

06:07.159 --> 06:10.911
We need to know so we don't
give you something that can
make you go into shock, okay?

06:11.079 --> 06:13.497
Whoa whoa, whoa...
Rise up, fool!

06:13.665 --> 06:15.249
I told you I shot him!

06:25.260 --> 06:27.053
Sit down.
I need to look at your head.

06:32.642 --> 06:35.019
It's all right, okay?
We're just gonna take a look.

06:36.271 --> 06:39.857
Just take a seat.
We just wanna
take a look, okay?

06:41.318 --> 06:45.905
Your head's in bad shape. But
I'm only gonna help you if you
drop that piece on the floor.

06:46.990 --> 06:50.576
You need to drop the gun
or we're leaving.
Come on...

06:50.744 --> 06:52.620
Not until you drop that gun.

06:55.832 --> 06:59.251
Drop the gun now!

07:05.842 --> 07:09.970
Gabriela, what can I say?
Say you'll check
the closet next time.

07:12.057 --> 07:16.936
Throw in for cooking club!
Hey, short arms, long pockets.

07:17.104 --> 07:20.022
Yeah, you.
How'd Herrmann get
the chef job?

07:20.190 --> 07:23.192
No gag reflex.
Otis, what happened
to your tour?

07:23.360 --> 07:24.860
Our new candidate.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.739
So this is called
a pass alarm.

07:28.907 --> 07:31.826
Now, if a firefighter is
totally still for more
than 18 seconds,

07:31.993 --> 07:34.662
a loud alarm goes off
until he moves again.
Why?

07:34.830 --> 07:38.791
Well, if he's hurt or trapped,
we'll know where to find him.

07:40.168 --> 07:44.839
That's loud, isn't it?
This house is special
because it has a Rescue Squad.

07:45.006 --> 07:47.258
Squad 3 serves a big piece of
the city.

07:47.425 --> 07:50.678
They're experts at
water rescue, extraction,
pretty much everything.

07:50.846 --> 07:52.596
They're like,
the best of the best.

07:52.764 --> 07:55.975
Why aren't you with them?
Well, I mean,
I plan to be.

07:56.143 --> 08:00.020
My father was a member
of the Squad years ago.
Mills, right?

08:00.188 --> 08:03.566
Last to show, first to go.
That's the Rescue Squad.

08:03.733 --> 08:06.485
You truck guys do such a
good job getting everything
ready for us,

08:06.653 --> 08:08.445
why would we want to
take that away from you?

08:08.613 --> 08:12.867
Kids, you should know they
make the rescue helmets extra
big to fit their heads inside.

08:13.034 --> 08:16.579
There are two types of
firefighters. Those who are
on squad and those who wish

08:16.746 --> 08:18.747
they were on squad.
Ooh...

08:18.915 --> 08:20.291
Come on, kids...

08:21.459 --> 08:23.752
Bet I get an application from
him by the end of the month.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.838
If he wants you,
you can have him.

08:30.135 --> 08:33.137
Pin-in accident,
Columbus Drive Bridge,

08:33.305 --> 08:40.311
Ambulance 61, Engine 51,
Truck 81, Squad 3,
Battalion Chief...

08:40.478 --> 08:42.438
Let's go! Let's go!

08:48.862 --> 08:50.154
Let's go!

09:12.052 --> 09:16.722
Mills, shadow Mouch.
Walk with a purpose,
but don't run.

09:16.890 --> 09:20.059
Take it all in,
know the details of the
situation before you act.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.604
Oh, and Mills,
don't be a crow.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.582
Ma'am, can you hear me?

09:43.750 --> 09:46.252
My daughter...
Madeline?

09:46.419 --> 09:48.754
Hey Cruz! Grab the saw!

09:48.922 --> 09:50.798
My little girl.
I see her. She's okay.

09:50.966 --> 09:52.967
Get the jaws!

09:53.134 --> 09:56.595
This is Chief Boden,
I'm gonna need two more
ambulances and a helicopter.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.013
You're fine, honey...

09:58.181 --> 10:00.724
Mother, daughter, trapped,
both responsive...
Can you hear me?

10:00.892 --> 10:03.435
Madeline.
Madeline?
Are you hurt, honey?

10:04.854 --> 10:06.188
Okay, can you tell me
where you hurt?

10:06.356 --> 10:07.815
My body

10:11.194 --> 10:15.072
Okay. You mean your tummy
or your chest?
My chest...

10:15.240 --> 10:18.784
Madeline, Mommy loves you.
Everything's gonna be okay.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.912
Madeline, look at Mommy.
Oh, geez.
He's in the water.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.706
He's in the water!
Who?

10:23.873 --> 10:27.626
The driver!
He was ejected!
Get someone on crowd control!

10:28.753 --> 10:30.879
We think we got one
in the river. Go!
We're on it!

10:31.047 --> 10:35.009
Now, listen, Madeline,
I want you to see if you can
turn your head toward me.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.635
Can you do that?

10:38.805 --> 10:43.017
Madeline... Madeline...
There you go. Open your legs,
you're okay.

10:49.899 --> 10:53.152
All right, Husting and me
are going. Capp and Hadley
on RIT and run the line.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.029
It's dumping gas!

11:07.667 --> 11:10.377
That's the driver!
Stop that guy!

11:10.545 --> 11:11.587
Go!

11:16.801 --> 11:17.801
I got him! I got him!

11:19.179 --> 11:21.638
I've got the driver.
He's in custody.

11:21.806 --> 11:25.142
Cancel the dive.
No one is in the water.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.023
It's okay.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.649
I'm scared.
Let's get her out of here.

11:32.817 --> 11:36.236
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Look at her jugular.
All right, sweetie.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.786
Muffled heart sounds.
It's Beck's triad.
Come on, sweetie.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.622
Come on.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.836
Time!
Less than two minutes.

11:54.881 --> 11:58.759
I got PEA! She's bleeding
into the bag around her heart.
I need to evacuate the blood.

11:58.927 --> 12:01.595
A minute-and-a-half!
She doesn't have a
minute-and-a-half, Shay!

12:01.763 --> 12:03.138
She's gonna be dead
before we get there.

12:03.306 --> 12:06.308
You gotta wait, Dawson!
Pull over the damn rig now!

12:13.775 --> 12:15.984
Come on, come on, come on...

12:16.152 --> 12:18.153
Damn it, I hit the heart.

12:18.321 --> 12:21.573
Back it out, slowly.
Slowly.

12:31.501 --> 12:32.835
Pressure's coming up. Go!

12:48.852 --> 12:52.521
Mediastinal hemorrhage.
I attempted pericardiocentisis
and saw PVCs.

12:52.689 --> 12:53.647
You hit her heart
with a needle?

12:53.815 --> 12:56.108
I backed it out and evacuated
as much blood as I could.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.735
Well, let's hope you didn't
kill her in the process.
Get her into three.

12:58.903 --> 13:01.947
Call Dr. Nesbitt upstairs and
tell him to prep for surgery.
Gabby.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.492
Don't worry about him.
He's an ass. And his wife's
finally leaving him,

13:05.660 --> 13:07.327
so there's that.
Thanks.

13:13.835 --> 13:17.212
Say, Lieutenant, now that we
have a new Candidate, I don't
have to be Otis anymore.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.464
You're still Otis.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.967
Maybe I could learn to drive
the truck and we could put
Peter Mills on the elevators.

13:22.135 --> 13:25.012
Herrmann,
what's this guy's name?
Otis.

13:25.180 --> 13:28.056
No, his real name.
Bart?

13:29.392 --> 13:31.768
Brian. Brian Zvonecek.

13:32.854 --> 13:36.773
He knew.
You're staying on elevators,
which makes you Otis. Sorry.

13:36.941 --> 13:39.860
Hey! A guy in the water?

13:41.070 --> 13:42.821
How about a guy
with his head up his ass?

13:42.989 --> 13:46.617
You handle your firefighters,
I'll handle mine.
That's a good theory, Casey.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.577
How about giving it a try?
You know what?

13:48.745 --> 13:50.329
I'm getting real tired
of your bull, Severide.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.414
I don't give a damn
what you're tired of.
Hey!

13:52.582 --> 13:54.666
I thought you all should know

13:54.834 --> 13:56.835
I am going to fight
that dick Olmstead
who slept with my wife,

13:57.003 --> 13:58.795
in Saturday's Drop-a-Cop.

13:58.963 --> 14:01.882
Or we could all just throw
the gloves on right now.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.592
Beat the hell
out of each other.

14:03.760 --> 14:07.304
Maybe when the Mayor
comes on Saturday,
that's what he sees.

14:07.472 --> 14:12.184
Truck versus Squad.
Old as the CFD,
so deal with it.

14:15.104 --> 14:18.732
We all lost Darden.
Month ago Friday.

14:20.068 --> 14:23.904
And that ain't changing.
So maybe we should.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.587
Hey, Heather.
Hey.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.589
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

14:44.175 --> 14:47.761
Thanks for meeting me
out here.
I just can't go in there.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.222
How are you?

14:54.102 --> 14:56.353
I don't know.
What do you want me to say?

14:59.607 --> 15:02.067
So that's it, huh?

15:02.235 --> 15:05.654
14 years at
this station and it all
fits into a box.

15:07.198 --> 15:10.659
Heather, there's not
a single place I look
and don't see him.

15:11.786 --> 15:16.081
The bells go off and I think,
"truck can't leave yet.
Andy's not on it.'

15:18.167 --> 15:23.380
Why don't you and Hallie and I
get together? I could use a
margarita... or four.

15:25.133 --> 15:28.510
Of course.
I'll have Hallie call you.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.667
Kelly.
Yeah.

16:09.802 --> 16:10.927
Here.

16:16.184 --> 16:17.893
Thanks.
Okay.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.419
You okay, Dawson?

17:25.586 --> 17:28.338
Uh, of course. Yeah, yeah.
It's, uh...

17:30.007 --> 17:31.758
Some days,
you know?

17:34.011 --> 17:36.096
Forget it. It's all good.
You?

17:38.391 --> 17:41.017
Listen, some of us are
going over to Buzzard's
tomorrow night

17:41.185 --> 17:42.894
if you and Hallie
want to come...

17:44.063 --> 17:48.650
We would, but we do a date
night thing. Just us.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.278
But, maybe we'll try.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.198
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, that sounds nice.

18:07.295 --> 18:08.253
Mr. Herrmann?

18:08.421 --> 18:10.881
I'm David Talbott,
an attorney with
the sheriff's department.

18:11.048 --> 18:13.717
Yeah. No problem.
We're all out.

18:13.885 --> 18:17.012
There's a dryer down in the
basement I couldn't get out
by myself, but otherwise,

18:17.180 --> 18:19.765
you know...
We'll take care of it.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.059
Oh, no...
we'll change the locks.

18:25.146 --> 18:26.646
Yeah, right.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.924
Hey!
Pizza, again?

18:56.511 --> 19:00.222
You can't live like that.
Come on in.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.520
I've only got a few minutes
before my shift.

19:14.612 --> 19:18.406
I... I can't wear this if
I'm not still engaged to you.

19:22.119 --> 19:23.370
Am I?

19:26.290 --> 19:29.876
You tell anyone I moved out?
No.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.879
You?

19:33.047 --> 19:34.089
No.

19:34.257 --> 19:35.841
So what are we doing?

19:36.008 --> 19:38.927
I'd marry you tomorrow,
Hallie, if I knew we wanted
the same things.

19:39.095 --> 19:41.930
I'm a resident, Matt. I cannot
start a family right now.
Yeah.

19:42.098 --> 19:43.723
That's been made
perfectly clear.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.229
So what are we doing?

19:52.483 --> 19:54.067
I don't know.

19:58.656 --> 20:00.282
Call me when you do.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.584
Yo, Peter Mills.

20:10.751 --> 20:13.587
My partner, Shay,
she's been asking about you.

20:13.754 --> 20:16.006
She's been talking about
you all morning.
I heard she's a monster.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.592
Dude I know over at 19
walked with a hitch
for a week.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.012
You guys are busting my balls.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.722
Listen to me, kid.

20:23.890 --> 20:27.475
I just lost my house
to foreclosure because
it took a bath in the market.

20:27.643 --> 20:31.062
We're now living at my
in-laws', which is two
bedrooms shy of unpleasant.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.482
My wife won't take her birth
control because the Pope said
if she did, God would cry,

20:34.650 --> 20:36.067
so I'm not having any sex.

20:36.235 --> 20:40.113
So, if there is any chance
that I could live vicariously
through you...

20:40.281 --> 20:42.157
it's literally all I got.

20:47.413 --> 20:48.872
All right.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.798
Hey.

20:58.966 --> 21:01.801
I'm Peter Mills.
Uh, Pete.

21:02.803 --> 21:06.389
Uh-huh.
Peter Mills, can you
hand me that box right there?

21:06.557 --> 21:08.183
Uh, yeah.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.686
Thanks.
Yeah.

21:11.854 --> 21:15.398
So, the little girl from
the bridge accident?
Is she okay?

21:15.566 --> 21:18.068
You really are new,
aren't you? Listen.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.656
We get 'em to the
doc the best we can,
and then we move on.

21:22.823 --> 21:27.285
It's the only way to
make it here.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

21:27.453 --> 21:31.456
So, uh, I was thinking...
I mean, I was wondering.

21:33.209 --> 21:36.836
Do you maybe wanna
hook up for a beer
or dinner or something?

21:38.714 --> 21:41.508
Peter Mills, are you gay?
Me? No.

21:42.843 --> 21:44.260
Because I am.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.978
Dawson! Shay!

21:53.145 --> 21:55.146
Which one of you put a needle
in the girl's heart?

22:06.367 --> 22:08.118
Give me a minute.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.999
Tell me what happened.

22:14.166 --> 22:18.712
Her heart was stopping and
we pulled over,
and I did what I had to do.

22:21.007 --> 22:24.551
It was the right thing to do.
The Chief Surgeon
at Lakeshore disagrees.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.430
Do you know who
your union rep is?
What?

22:28.597 --> 22:31.850
Get him involved, right now.
Just as a precaution.

22:32.018 --> 22:36.021
Maybe this goes away,
but just in case it doesn't...
Chief...

22:38.941 --> 22:40.400
You two stick together.

22:47.241 --> 22:49.993
How long were you
the Candidate here?
Not long. Four years.

22:50.161 --> 22:52.203
I can't believe we're gonna
miss the fights tonight.

22:52.371 --> 22:55.415
Well, it's just as well,
'cause I just found out he
fought Golden Gloves.

22:55.583 --> 22:59.002
Ah, that was 20 years ago,
Chief! We gotta tape it or
something. We gotta see it.

23:01.213 --> 23:05.258
What's the Lieutenant doing?
He said he wanted to cook
the Saturday corned beef.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.095
Ah, look at that.

23:09.263 --> 23:12.307
He made the best
chicken parmigiana
I ever put in my mouth.

23:12.475 --> 23:15.477
What do ya got there, Casey?
Don't you worry about it.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.270
Call everyone to chow.

23:19.231 --> 23:23.109
Hey, Casey's in there
cooking.
Casey?

23:36.290 --> 23:37.540
Have at it.

23:57.353 --> 24:00.980
What the hell's going on?
You okay?

24:01.148 --> 24:04.984
Because if you're not,
maybe you need to take...
You think I need your help?

24:05.152 --> 24:08.071
I'm trying here, Severide.
Keep on.

24:12.493 --> 24:14.202
I cleaned out Darden's locker.

24:17.498 --> 24:18.998
You should have
vented the back.

24:19.166 --> 24:22.085
We're called the Rescue Squad,
Casey. We don't vent.

24:22.253 --> 24:24.379
You shouldn't have put Andy
through the window.

24:25.965 --> 24:29.008
I don't have to explain
myself to you.
I sleep like a baby.

24:30.761 --> 24:31.719
You?

24:41.480 --> 24:44.649
Say, Herrmann? You think
maybe you just bought a
little too much house?

24:44.817 --> 24:49.112
I was preyed upon by
low-interest loan vultures.
What time is the Mayor coming?

24:49.280 --> 24:50.530
I heard nine.

24:50.698 --> 24:53.575
I heard he stops
to take a piss at
every house in the city.

24:53.742 --> 24:56.077
As a sign of respect.
Stopped here in June.

24:56.245 --> 24:58.663
Hey, Boden's about
to fight in ten minutes.

25:02.168 --> 25:05.962
Screw it. Let's take a ride.
Let's take a ride.

25:06.130 --> 25:07.463
Let's go.
Yeah.

25:10.134 --> 25:14.304
Fighting out of the
red corner, representing the
Chicago Fire Department,

25:14.471 --> 25:18.057
Chief Boden!

25:18.225 --> 25:21.603
Hello, sports fans,
this is Brian Zvonecek,

25:21.770 --> 25:25.106
coming to you live
from the annual
Battle of the Badges.

25:25.274 --> 25:27.817
Firefighters versus
the Police.
What's that?

25:27.985 --> 25:30.153
I hope you all are
ready for this.
That's Otis.

25:30.321 --> 25:33.448
Boden looks like a
heat-seeking missile
as he climbs into the ring

25:33.616 --> 25:36.701
to take on Captain Olmstead,
from the CPD.

25:36.869 --> 25:40.121
Olmstead, of course,
looks like the quivering
cop slob that he is.

25:40.289 --> 25:45.501
Chief Boden first won
back in 1992 when he was
on the esteemed Truck 81.

25:45.669 --> 25:48.671
The greatest truck in
all of Chicago.
Mouch...

25:51.175 --> 25:53.092
I can't keep making
excuses for you.

25:53.260 --> 25:55.929
There goes the bell
and here we go...

25:56.096 --> 26:00.016
Boden takes two quick
jabs to the nose.
He falls back into the ropes.

26:00.184 --> 26:05.104
One, two, three to the chin.
Boden's in trouble already,
folks.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.690
Wait, here he comes!

26:07.858 --> 26:10.485
Three straight lefts
to stand Olmstead up...

26:10.653 --> 26:13.446
Accident,
building fire.
241 Franklin Street.

26:13.614 --> 26:17.617
Ambulance 61, Engine 51,
Truck 81, Squad 3.
That's just down the block.

26:17.785 --> 26:21.913
81 responding.
We're rollin'.
Copy that, 81.

26:25.167 --> 26:26.542
This is 51 responding.

26:27.711 --> 26:29.879
Ambulance 61
en route with speed.

26:33.342 --> 26:36.344
81 responding with
speed to this call.

26:37.638 --> 26:40.390
103 responding to
Franklin Street building fire.

26:50.859 --> 26:53.444
Wow, this is bad, bad, bad.

27:03.205 --> 27:06.082
Otis, get to the elevator
and tell us
what we're looking at.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.251
Mills, help Cruz
vent the roof.

27:10.170 --> 27:13.631
Herrmann...
you and me to the top floor
and work our way down.

27:13.799 --> 27:14.882
Let's move.

27:25.227 --> 27:27.979
Over here!
Keep moving.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.317
People coming out.
Let's go, Herrmann.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.152
The second floor is
completely yours.

27:54.173 --> 27:57.508
Fire department!
Anyone here?

28:00.971 --> 28:04.724
Hey, slow breaths, okay?

28:13.901 --> 28:17.403
Elevator One is clear!
Something's keeping it open.

28:17.571 --> 28:21.449
We've got an open
door on five!
Let's clear it!

28:21.617 --> 28:25.703
Otis and Vargas
heading up to five.
Elevator obstruction.

28:25.871 --> 28:27.955
Give me a diagonal stripe
right here!

28:31.085 --> 28:34.253
Fire department! Anyone here?

28:34.421 --> 28:36.547
- Call out!
- Help!

28:38.175 --> 28:39.425
Help us!

28:41.470 --> 28:43.179
We're under here!

28:46.350 --> 28:50.395
It's gonna be all right.
We'll get you out. Come on.

28:50.562 --> 28:53.981
Watch your head, sweetie.
Come on. I got ya.

28:56.110 --> 28:57.568
Woman down!

29:00.989 --> 29:04.784
Can you walk? All right.
Go to this guy. Go to Mouch.

29:07.204 --> 29:10.581
Truck 81, we hear two more
alarms. We're going back in.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.834
Roger, 81.
Let's go.

29:18.006 --> 29:21.300
Use your ax!

29:21.468 --> 29:24.679
I'll take her.

29:31.562 --> 29:33.521
It's ready to vent! Back up!

29:40.988 --> 29:42.405
Roof is open.

29:47.494 --> 29:50.037
It's too red!
We've got to go down!

29:50.205 --> 29:52.248
Everybody out! Out!
Let 'em get hoses on it!

29:58.630 --> 30:01.674
Rescue Squad is
two minutes out. Ambo, too.
What do you have?

30:01.842 --> 30:04.135
Cruz and Mills are heading
down from the roof.

30:04.303 --> 30:08.222
Otis, Vargas, Casey,
and Herrmann are clear on
floor four and headed down.

30:09.224 --> 30:12.185
No, no, no.
They've gotta go up.
The smoke's gone black.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.021
Casey, up.

30:15.189 --> 30:18.065
Go up to the roof.
Casey, do you copy?

30:18.233 --> 30:22.320
Up! Up! Now!
Move! Go! Go! Go!

30:32.581 --> 30:35.291
Casey! Herrmann!

30:49.848 --> 30:51.432
Rescue Squad on scene.

30:55.312 --> 30:59.190
We have at least two
not moving in the basement.
Casey and Herrmann.

30:59.358 --> 31:02.401
We'll get 'em.
Squad 3 moving in.

31:02.569 --> 31:04.195
Hold engines for a minute.

31:18.168 --> 31:21.337
Up here! Up here!

31:21.505 --> 31:22.588
Go up!

31:24.341 --> 31:28.636
This is Severide! I need
a ladder over the west side
window, fifth floor.

31:28.804 --> 31:30.638
I see Casey and Herrmann.

31:30.806 --> 31:33.099
Give me a rope! Throw it down!

31:36.144 --> 31:37.979
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

31:44.736 --> 31:48.281
Okay. Down! Down! Lower.

31:49.992 --> 31:52.118
Okay, I'm down. I'm fine!

31:54.580 --> 31:58.499
Come on, get up!
You don't wanna miss
the Mayor's visit.

31:58.667 --> 32:02.628
You're cooking down here.
Hey! You all right?

32:03.672 --> 32:06.549
Herrmann...
Herrmann!

32:07.676 --> 32:09.051
Turn him!

32:10.721 --> 32:12.680
Hey! His air!

32:18.562 --> 32:19.520
Take a breath, Herrmann.
Breathe, Herrmann.

32:19.688 --> 32:22.648
Hey, get me
another line down here!

32:27.904 --> 32:30.072
Otis? Need a lift?

32:32.117 --> 32:35.453
This is the last resident.
Building's clear!
Got her.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.079
Thanks, buddy!

32:41.835 --> 32:43.336
Get him up.

32:46.673 --> 32:47.923
Watch that!

32:49.926 --> 32:51.719
Get him up! Let's go!

33:00.604 --> 33:02.188
Hey!

33:45.565 --> 33:47.274
I got you, Lieutenant.

34:14.594 --> 34:16.011
I'm okay.

34:19.266 --> 34:22.143
I'm okay.
You're okay.

34:22.310 --> 34:24.437
I'm okay.
You're gonna be all right.

34:26.940 --> 34:30.484
That's right, Herrmann,
you're fine, okay?
Tension pneumothorax...

34:36.575 --> 34:38.159
Don't think, just do it.

34:44.624 --> 34:46.751
All right, stay with me,
Christopher.

34:48.462 --> 34:52.089
Stay with me. He's probably
got other internal damage.
Help me get him inside.

35:05.395 --> 35:08.481
Clear! Squad 3, Truck 81
are clear!

35:08.648 --> 35:10.608
Roger.
Open up the hoses.

35:17.157 --> 35:19.950
How's Herrmann?
On his way to Lakeshore.

35:40.806 --> 35:44.183
Nice work, Candidate.
Thanks.

35:45.685 --> 35:47.603
Now start packing up our gear.

35:50.065 --> 35:53.108
Looks like we're gonna
meet the mayor after all.

36:26.351 --> 36:30.521
Do you think there's
gonna be a hearing?
Okay.

36:30.689 --> 36:31.814
Thank you.

36:33.567 --> 36:34.567
Union?

36:36.027 --> 36:39.905
Yeah, yeah. Uh, they're
starting a file on me.

36:41.074 --> 36:43.993
I'm going to the hospital
to check in on Herrmann
if you want to come.

36:46.121 --> 36:47.454
What do you know?

36:48.707 --> 36:51.083
I know we can't lose
another one.

37:08.143 --> 37:09.643
Furlough request.

37:12.188 --> 37:14.023
Hell of a first day, Mills.

37:15.108 --> 37:17.610
You handled yourself.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.778
The rest of the truck
will remember that.

37:21.448 --> 37:22.907
Thank you, Chief.

37:25.327 --> 37:28.537
Uh, Chief, one other thing.

37:28.705 --> 37:33.042
I was talking to the Rescue
Squad, and Lieutenant Casey
told me not to be a "crow."

37:33.209 --> 37:34.126
You know what that means?

37:36.922 --> 37:38.005
Oh, did he?

37:39.382 --> 37:42.009
A crow wanted to be a peacock,

37:42.177 --> 37:46.472
so he put on colored feathers
and went over to the peacock
yard, but the peacocks,

37:47.641 --> 37:51.560
they plucked them all away.
So the crow,

37:51.728 --> 37:53.562
he tried to get back
with the crows,

37:54.981 --> 37:56.649
but they wanted
nothing to do with him.

38:00.111 --> 38:03.113
My mom used to tell me to keep
my mouth shut and just watch.

38:05.408 --> 38:07.368
I'm glad I have you here
to watch, Chief.

38:56.001 --> 38:59.086
Any update?
He's in surgery,
trying to find the bleed.

38:59.254 --> 39:00.671
They don't know.

39:02.132 --> 39:05.217
I got her into four.
She's 190 over 80
so let's keep a watch on her.

39:09.389 --> 39:11.849
Hey, Doc.
Yes?

39:12.017 --> 39:15.561
Um, Dawson, what was the
name of that little girl
from the bridge?

39:15.729 --> 39:17.062
Casey, don't.

39:19.816 --> 39:22.651
Madeline.
That was her name.

39:22.819 --> 39:26.238
A little girl named Madeline,
pin-in from the Columbus Drive
Bridge. Where is she?

39:31.786 --> 39:36.540
Madeline Pokress.
Vitals are stable, release
by the end of the week.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.208
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

39:43.506 --> 39:45.632
Anything change?
He's still in surgery.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.343
I called his family.
They're on their way
in from Wheaton.

39:48.511 --> 39:50.179
Come get me
if there's an update?

40:14.871 --> 40:16.080
What are you doing?

40:19.125 --> 40:22.795
Just...
wanted to hear your voice.

40:25.340 --> 40:27.132
How was your shift?

40:27.300 --> 40:31.553
It was fine.
Typical.
What is it, Matt?

40:36.434 --> 40:40.395
Do you think, maybe you
could find a reason
to come over tonight?
