00:06.941 --> 00:09.376
Hey! Stop right there!

00:09.476 --> 00:12.145
Stop right there! Get down on the ground!

00:12.245 --> 00:15.205
- Please.
- On the ground right now!

00:16.399 --> 00:18.351
On your knees!

00:18.451 --> 00:21.821
Are you alone? Is anybody with you?

00:21.921 --> 00:24.490
Are you infected?

00:24.590 --> 00:28.796
Listen, look at me, are you infected?

00:29.096 --> 00:30.655
Yes!

00:32.031 --> 00:35.997
But I heard there was a cure.
Please. Please, don't shoot.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.001
Wait!

00:40.105 --> 00:42.357
Please, don't hurt me.

00:43.743 --> 00:47.144
I was told there was a cure.
Please, you need to help me.

00:50.282 --> 00:52.503
I just need some help.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.751
It's time to wake up, Jacob.

03:18.565 --> 03:20.625
Where am I?

03:24.605 --> 03:28.320
If it was up to me, I'd just kill you.

03:30.009 --> 03:32.436
That's why it isn't up to you.

03:48.594 --> 03:50.395
I trusted you.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.567
I vouched for you.

04:09.667 --> 04:12.726
But you used me to get to him.

04:14.521 --> 04:16.380
I'm sorry.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.586
So you're not sorry, Jacob.

04:22.994 --> 04:24.854
Not yet.

04:25.164 --> 04:27.367
When I'm done with you,

04:27.467 --> 04:30.559
you're gonna wish I'd killed you.

04:33.639 --> 04:36.132
And then you will be sorry.

04:42.481 --> 04:44.475
What was that?

04:46.203 --> 04:50.090
They use it in psych wards on patients
who need to forget their past.

04:50.190 --> 04:54.093
Right now,
it's entering your blood stream.

04:54.193 --> 04:56.554
When it gets to your brain...

04:57.298 --> 04:59.856
you won't even remember my name.

05:10.075 --> 05:13.681
Listen up, people! Pull up the profiles.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.415
What's going on?

05:15.515 --> 05:17.816
Judging by the amount of firepower
we're sending in there,

05:17.916 --> 05:20.553
- looks like we're going to war.
- Here's what we know.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.857
About four months ago
we intercepted a message

05:23.957 --> 05:27.861
outlining that an international terrorist
group was about to release a virus

05:27.961 --> 05:30.800
nationally, possibly globally.

05:32.265 --> 05:34.200
Three days ago Senator Keller died.

05:34.300 --> 05:37.472
Cause of death,
gunshot wound to the chest.

05:38.169 --> 05:42.758
Unfortunately, he was the only person that
we're aware of that had the cure to the virus.

05:42.858 --> 05:44.997
Show me the scientist.

05:45.328 --> 05:50.566
The senator had connections with this man,
Eric O'Conner, a bio-chemical engineer.

05:50.666 --> 05:53.036
The extent of their relationship
is unknown,

05:53.136 --> 05:56.408
but we believe the scientist
created the biochemical weapon.

05:56.508 --> 06:00.109
We also suspect that the antidote
was distributed for safekeeping

06:00.209 --> 06:01.944
before the lab was incinerated.

06:02.044 --> 06:05.315
After the senator's death,
the only lead we had was his daughter,

06:05.415 --> 06:07.782
who dropped off the face
of the earth after he died.

06:07.882 --> 06:10.721
That is, until 40 minutes ago
when we received a tip

06:10.821 --> 06:13.032
that she's here,
in the old boemer factory.

06:13.132 --> 06:17.061
We're sending in a team.
They're armed and cleared to engage.

06:17.161 --> 06:19.566
ETA, 30 minutes.

06:37.746 --> 06:39.081
In position.

06:39.181 --> 06:42.222
<i>Roger, reaper. What's your visual?</i>

06:43.919 --> 06:46.124
Two hostiles.

06:46.321 --> 06:49.128
<i>Reaper, you are cleared to engage.</i>

06:49.991 --> 06:51.582
On your mark.

07:08.510 --> 07:10.412
Area cleared.

07:10.512 --> 07:13.352
Team arriving on site, 60 seconds.

07:17.252 --> 07:19.325
Watch him.

07:26.828 --> 07:29.801
She's got more patience
for you than I ever did.

07:33.136 --> 07:34.770
But when this is all over,

07:34.870 --> 07:38.460
I'm going to be the one that plants
a bullet right between your eyes.

07:39.575 --> 07:42.146
And you ain't even going to see it coming.

08:24.385 --> 08:26.691
Line up! Line up!

08:27.057 --> 08:28.823
Go, go, go, go, go!

08:28.923 --> 08:33.000
I want my bird's-eye feed up now.
And where are my gun cams?

08:39.602 --> 08:43.607
- Go, go, go!
- <i>Alpha team approaching wave point two.</i>

08:43.972 --> 08:45.695
Go, go, go, go!

08:53.482 --> 08:56.688
Alpha, Bravo, you are clear for breach.

09:01.656 --> 09:03.361
Charges in!

09:24.279 --> 09:26.015
<i>Get me Henderson.</i>

09:26.115 --> 09:28.151
Sir, I have Chase Williams
on the line for you.

09:28.251 --> 09:31.519
Tell him he needs to abort the mission now!
It's not what he thinks.

09:31.619 --> 09:35.762
- If he sends them in now, we'll lose it.
- Sir, he's saying not to go in.

09:52.310 --> 09:56.248
<i>When they look back on this day,
they will call us heroes.</i>

09:57.245 --> 10:00.519
<i>This is how we can control our rebirth.</i>

10:01.933 --> 10:04.217
<i>To do it by design.</i>

10:10.843 --> 10:13.450
<i>...call us heroes.</i>

10:43.894 --> 10:47.917
- There's a laboratory here.
- <i>Affirmative, Bravo.</i>

10:48.697 --> 10:51.170
<i>Proceed to primary objective.</i>

10:59.208 --> 11:00.712
Clear.

11:39.114 --> 11:41.919
<i>Ready? Let's go. Cover me.</i>

11:46.488 --> 11:48.156
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

11:48.456 --> 11:49.958
Contact!

11:50.358 --> 11:52.564
Spread out! Spread out!

11:58.366 --> 12:00.771
Come on! Come on!

12:08.276 --> 12:11.150
Officer down, we need assistance.

12:11.713 --> 12:16.222
<i>Command, come in.
Officer down, we need assistance.</i>

12:16.322 --> 12:20.197
<i>Command, I repeat this is Alpha,
we are under heavy fire.</i>

12:20.297 --> 12:22.590
<i>I repeat, officer down!</i>

12:22.690 --> 12:24.697
We need cover!

12:26.828 --> 12:28.899
Watch your back.

12:37.506 --> 12:41.644
Command, we need assistance!
Requesting support from Bravo!

12:41.744 --> 12:45.681
<i>Negative, Alpha. Bravo, we need you
to continue to the main objective.</i>

12:45.781 --> 12:48.984
<i>Alpha, hold on tight. You're on your own.</i>

12:49.084 --> 12:53.020
We need to cover more ground.
Thomson, rendezvous with Bravo.

12:54.255 --> 12:56.662
The rest, come with me.

14:13.502 --> 14:17.943
I knew I should've killed you.
You're going to pay for what you did.

14:22.043 --> 14:24.782
You can't even remember a thing, can you?

14:26.749 --> 14:30.488
That's okay, you're going to die anyway.

14:45.550 --> 14:49.357
Hey! Are you okay? Are you okay?

14:50.905 --> 14:53.345
Okay, we have to go.

14:55.377 --> 14:58.083
We have to get out of here now! Now!

15:16.730 --> 15:18.702
I'd just kill you.

15:49.931 --> 15:51.937
I'm hit!

16:41.448 --> 16:43.352
Who are they and why are they chasing us?

16:43.452 --> 16:46.955
Listen, that door
is not going to stay closed.

16:47.055 --> 16:51.029
We don't want to be here
when they get in. We gotta go.

16:56.531 --> 16:58.900
Stop! Freeze!

16:59.000 --> 17:00.571
Freeze!

17:07.074 --> 17:09.347
Target on the roof.

17:16.049 --> 17:19.854
- I've got a clear shot.
- <i>Negative, Reaper, do not engage.</i>

17:19.954 --> 17:22.759
<i>We need them alive.</i>

17:42.643 --> 17:44.846
Suspects are leaving the building
from the north side.

17:44.946 --> 17:49.413
- I want all agents to intercept.
- All agents to intercept.

18:43.738 --> 18:47.142
Stop! Stop the car! Get out!

18:47.242 --> 18:49.080
Get out!

19:06.094 --> 19:09.929
Contact local authorities.
Give them the car make and model.

19:10.029 --> 19:12.267
I want cops at every major intersection,

19:12.367 --> 19:14.635
and I want roadblocks
at every highway entrance ramp.

19:14.735 --> 19:17.140
We can't afford to lose her, people.

19:18.205 --> 19:20.310
Stop the car.

19:20.774 --> 19:24.398
Stop the car. Stop the car!

19:36.558 --> 19:39.460
Jake! Jacob, wait!

19:39.560 --> 19:42.195
Look, I don't know who you are
or how you think you know me,

19:42.295 --> 19:45.399
so let's get one thing straight,
stay the hell away from me.

19:45.499 --> 19:47.904
I'm your fiancee.

19:50.938 --> 19:52.740
- My what?
- Yeah.

19:52.840 --> 19:56.177
So unless there's something else
you really need to know right now,

19:56.277 --> 19:58.825
- I think we should get somewhere else safe.
- They're gone.

19:58.925 --> 20:01.049
They're coming back.
They don't give up that easy.

20:01.149 --> 20:03.296
- Who? Who are they and what do they want?
- You!

20:03.396 --> 20:05.768
- Me?
- Yeah. You know too much.

20:05.868 --> 20:08.490
I know too much?
I don't even know your name!

20:08.590 --> 20:10.023
You'll remember it.

20:10.123 --> 20:13.345
- All of it. They're counting on it!
- Who? Who's counting on it?

20:13.445 --> 20:15.930
I'll explain later!
Can we just go somewhere else safe?

20:16.030 --> 20:17.897
You think I'm getting back
in that car with you?

20:17.997 --> 20:19.967
I don't know you. I don't trust you.

20:20.067 --> 20:22.703
I don't even know who I am.
I don't even know how I got here.

20:22.803 --> 20:25.542
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

20:27.675 --> 20:30.079
You're name is Jacob Bradley.

20:30.944 --> 20:33.382
You were trained to keep my father safe.

20:33.482 --> 20:36.120
So what, I'm like a bodyguard?

20:37.283 --> 20:39.319
You're crazy.

20:39.419 --> 20:41.625
Yeah, I am.

21:00.840 --> 21:03.113
You need to trust me.

21:25.866 --> 21:29.571
- You went in when I said not to.
- You're not calling the shots here, Chase.

21:29.671 --> 21:32.625
We simply called you as a courtesy
to let you know that we were going in.

21:32.725 --> 21:35.025
But if you would've listened to me
we wouldn't be in this mess.

21:35.125 --> 21:38.171
Listen, with the senator dead,
Emily and that bodyguard

21:38.271 --> 21:40.883
are the closest thing we have to getting
our hands on what we need.

21:40.983 --> 21:44.988
So I am not about to apologize
for going in and trying to save our asses.

21:45.551 --> 21:47.188
You're on the line here, David, not me.

21:47.288 --> 21:50.136
Don't be naive.
This thing is bigger than both of us.

21:50.236 --> 21:53.630
If this falls apart
you and I are both going down.

22:01.734 --> 22:03.873
Is that it?

22:04.371 --> 22:07.779
No. But we found it at the warehouse.

22:15.083 --> 22:17.853
So tell me about this bodyguard.
Who is he?

22:17.953 --> 22:20.622
We have nothing in our files on him.

22:21.322 --> 22:23.992
Jacob Bradley.
He's a washed up police officer.

22:24.092 --> 22:27.819
Been passed over for SWAT several times.
Been trying to prove them wrong ever since.

22:27.919 --> 22:31.568
So what you're telling me is that we got
a deadbeat cop who thinks he's Rambo.

22:31.668 --> 22:34.404
- Yeah.
- That's great.

22:47.248 --> 22:49.154
How about your name?

22:50.449 --> 22:52.022
Right.

22:53.220 --> 22:55.025
Emily.

22:55.790 --> 22:58.492
Means nothing to you, does it?

22:58.592 --> 23:01.698
No. No, it doesn't.

23:04.164 --> 23:06.136
Well, we'll give it time.

23:07.534 --> 23:11.108
What if I don't remember? What then?

23:18.110 --> 23:20.517
Then we have a fresh start.

23:55.116 --> 23:57.951
Who are you waiting for?
They're not coming.

23:58.051 --> 24:00.357
You care too much for her.

24:00.821 --> 24:03.260
<i>Make sure she survives.</i>

25:46.909 --> 25:50.463
<i>The story of Dr. Paul Dietrich
continues today with an interesting twist.</i>

25:50.563 --> 25:54.068
<i>His online announcement last Friday
was that he had found the cure to cancer.</i>

25:54.168 --> 25:56.469
<i>In less than a week,
his video has gone viral.</i>

25:56.569 --> 26:00.173
<i>Dr. Dietrich and his associate,
Dr. Eric O'Conner, are still missing.</i>

26:00.273 --> 26:02.125
<i>The police have no leads.
Back to you, Robert.</i>

26:02.225 --> 26:05.563
Listen, I know what you're going through.

26:06.379 --> 26:08.617
Sure, you do.

26:09.917 --> 26:14.357
Well... tell me,
what is it I'm going through?

26:17.823 --> 26:20.196
I know you feel lost.

26:21.361 --> 26:25.534
That everything you know and feel
has been taken away from you.

26:28.034 --> 26:31.436
That there's this gaping hole
inside of you...

26:31.536 --> 26:33.105
and you don't know how to fill it.

26:33.205 --> 26:35.275
That you can't even decide
what you want for breakfast

26:35.375 --> 26:38.348
because you don't even know what you like.

26:39.145 --> 26:41.414
Here's the facts.

26:41.514 --> 26:43.886
I'm the only person you have.

26:44.382 --> 26:46.820
I know who did this to you.

26:46.920 --> 26:51.660
The only way we're going
to get through this is together.

26:53.794 --> 26:56.516
<i>The death of Senator Keller
was a tragic loss for this nation.</i>

26:56.616 --> 26:59.934
<i>We are still investigating
the person responsible.</i>

27:00.034 --> 27:02.702
<i>His daughter's whereabouts
are still unknown.</i>

27:02.902 --> 27:07.630
<i>If you have any information regarding
this case, please contact the police.</i>

27:07.930 --> 27:10.110
We need each other.

27:10.510 --> 27:12.749
I need you.

27:13.914 --> 27:16.585
Just give me a couple minutes, okay?

28:39.366 --> 28:41.571
It's okay.

28:41.900 --> 28:44.306
It's okay, just put the gun down.

28:44.604 --> 28:47.010
You did what you had to do.

29:06.923 --> 29:09.595
I just killed someone,
so you need to start talking to me, Emily.

29:09.695 --> 29:12.002
Trust me, it wasn't your first time.

29:13.532 --> 29:17.369
If you want answers we've got to follow
this key and find out why they're after you.

29:17.469 --> 29:19.939
How do you know they're after me?
Maybe they're after you.

29:20.039 --> 29:23.008
Because you were there when he died, Jacob,
and they didn't kill you.

29:23.108 --> 29:27.116
The only reason why you're still alive is
'cause you have something that they want.

29:27.947 --> 29:31.085
My father gave you something.
I don't know what it is.

29:32.118 --> 29:34.724
But he trusted you like a son.

30:33.679 --> 30:35.919
When was this?

30:37.484 --> 30:39.721
Last summer.

30:39.984 --> 30:42.826
How long have they been
following your father?

30:55.619 --> 30:58.557
- Hello?
- <i>Who is this?</i>

31:42.883 --> 31:43.850
Look...

31:43.950 --> 31:49.074
- I know some people who could help us.
- No. No more people. I'm done.

31:51.656 --> 31:54.360
We can't outrun them, Jake.
They're going to find us.

31:54.460 --> 31:57.330
We can't just give up,
we can't just run away.

31:57.430 --> 31:59.832
Lives are at stake,
people are going to die.

31:59.932 --> 32:01.834
I almost died, all right!

32:01.934 --> 32:05.103
So let's get it through your head.
I'm not your hero.

32:05.203 --> 32:07.174
I'm getting out of here
as fast as possible.

32:07.274 --> 32:11.614
If you want to stay here,
you feel free to do so. I'm done.

32:13.312 --> 32:15.331
I'm not leaving.

32:15.431 --> 32:17.903
I'm not running away.

32:37.001 --> 32:38.238
What happened?

32:38.338 --> 32:41.872
Stephan's body was found
in the bathroom of a diner downtown.

32:41.972 --> 32:43.641
He was shot.

32:43.741 --> 32:48.883
Witnesses say they saw a man and a woman
leaving the scene after they heard gunfire.

32:49.114 --> 32:52.087
This is the last message
I received from him.

32:55.020 --> 32:57.640
I called his phone an hour later...

32:57.740 --> 32:59.441
and I got this.

32:59.591 --> 33:02.631
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

33:03.562 --> 33:05.835
This is going too far.

33:06.164 --> 33:09.370
We got to clean this up
and get control of the situation.

33:16.309 --> 33:18.877
I need you to tell me what this is.

33:18.977 --> 33:21.248
Where'd you get it?

33:21.815 --> 33:24.286
It's better that you don't know.

33:38.497 --> 33:40.801
Okay, Jake?

33:41.001 --> 33:44.135
If you have a plan,
I'd really like to hear it by now.

33:44.936 --> 33:46.741
The plan?

33:47.307 --> 33:49.812
The plan is to get off the grid.

33:53.512 --> 33:57.113
We're in the middle of nowhere!
This is off the grid!

34:06.324 --> 34:08.329
Where you headin'?

34:09.411 --> 34:11.864
As far as you can take us.

34:11.964 --> 34:13.899
You two are from the city, aren't ya?

34:13.998 --> 34:16.918
I mean, there's nothing
for 100 miles down that way.

34:17.018 --> 34:19.388
You'd better head back into town
before it gets too dark.

34:19.538 --> 34:22.011
We'd really prefer
not to head back to town.

34:25.844 --> 34:28.550
What kind of trouble are you two into?

34:29.481 --> 34:30.817
Excuse me?

34:30.917 --> 34:34.219
I mean, am I going to regret
trying to help you two out?

34:34.319 --> 34:35.858
No, sir.

34:41.891 --> 34:44.831
All right. Get in then.

34:49.101 --> 34:51.436
I'm not getting in a car with him.

34:51.536 --> 34:53.438
All right.

34:53.538 --> 34:55.509
Suit yourself.

35:05.384 --> 35:08.323
I'm Henry. I live by two rules.

35:08.854 --> 35:12.627
First rule. Second rule.

35:19.064 --> 35:22.225
We don't know whether this thing is viral
or airborne. It's an absolute nightmare.

35:22.325 --> 35:25.454
All we know is that once people get
the virus, they got two weeks tops.

35:25.554 --> 35:27.542
Then they're dead.

35:28.741 --> 35:30.878
This is Robert.

35:31.574 --> 35:33.982
What are you talking to me for?

35:36.315 --> 35:40.205
UA592, you are instructed to return
to your country of origin.

35:40.305 --> 35:42.387
You are denied entrance to our airspace.

35:42.487 --> 35:45.223
L29206, that's a negative.
We are low on fuel.

35:45.323 --> 35:48.047
We have several passengers on board
that need immediate medical attention.

35:48.147 --> 35:51.029
Requesting emergency landing immediately.

35:51.229 --> 35:53.264
- Go ahead.
- <i>We have a situation.</i>

35:53.364 --> 35:55.334
<i>There's a plane declaring
an emergency landing.</i>

35:55.434 --> 35:58.136
<i>We believe the passengers
are infected with Strain 31.</i>

35:58.236 --> 36:01.907
- <i>They'll enter our airspace in 14 minutes.</i>
- Turn the plane around.

36:02.007 --> 36:05.311
<i>We've already tried to defer them
but the pilots won't deviate from the course.</i>

36:05.411 --> 36:08.213
<i>Like I said, they're declaring
an emergency landing.</i>

36:08.313 --> 36:11.886
<i>If this plane touches down,
we won't be able to contain it.</i>

36:12.216 --> 36:14.569
- Take it down.
- <i>Excuse me?</i>

36:14.669 --> 36:18.590
- Shoot the plane down.
- <i>Sir, I think I'm not hearing you properly.</i>

36:18.690 --> 36:21.396
I said, shoot the damn plane
out of the sky.

36:23.427 --> 36:25.103
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

36:29.601 --> 36:32.303
UA592, this is your final warning.

36:32.403 --> 36:34.620
Return or you will be fired upon.

36:34.720 --> 36:37.575
I told you, we have passengers on board
that need medical attention now.

36:37.675 --> 36:40.148
We're landing this plane!

36:43.398 --> 36:45.603
Where's he going?

36:46.618 --> 36:48.657
Target locked.

37:04.169 --> 37:08.910
Send in a clean-up crew. Run a story.
Do whatever you have to do.

37:10.508 --> 37:13.516
Run a story.
I'll get right on that, David.

37:13.746 --> 37:16.998
- We shot a civilian aircraft out of the sky!
- Yes, we did.

37:17.098 --> 37:19.884
- There were people on board!
- We had no choice!

37:19.984 --> 37:21.585
Sir...

37:21.685 --> 37:25.059
with all due respect, have you stopped
to think about what they'll do to us

37:25.159 --> 37:27.392
when they find out what we did.

37:27.492 --> 37:32.968
Daniels, I am simply trying
to give this country another day.

38:04.363 --> 38:06.568
This is where we'll be staying.

38:08.467 --> 38:11.138
Water doesn't work. Pipes are rusted.

38:11.869 --> 38:15.644
Don't bother trying to start the engine,
it hasn't run in years.

38:16.340 --> 38:20.912
If it rains, well...
you'd better hope it doesn't rain.

38:21.012 --> 38:24.215
There's some blankets up here,
some clothes in the closet.

38:24.315 --> 38:27.019
There's some toothpaste
back in the bathroom.

38:27.451 --> 38:31.492
You're going to have to use your fingers.
I don't lend my toothbrush to nobody.

38:31.689 --> 38:35.296
I'll be staying over at the house.
If you need anything, give me a shout.

38:37.228 --> 38:39.534
But you'll be fine until the morning.

38:54.145 --> 38:57.517
Well, you're right about one thing, Jake.

39:00.686 --> 39:03.325
No one's going to find us here.

39:19.338 --> 39:22.043
You're not a peeping tom, are ya?

39:23.808 --> 39:26.347
No one likes a peeping tom.

39:27.612 --> 39:29.817
It's cold down here.

39:30.850 --> 39:34.055
Well, if you're going to stand there,
you may as well come in.

39:37.422 --> 39:40.593
Heard you banging away outside,
what are you up to?

39:43.695 --> 39:46.534
I'm fixing what they said can't be fixed.

39:47.565 --> 39:49.136
Yeah?

39:49.602 --> 39:51.605
Sounds like it.

39:56.407 --> 39:59.345
You've been in those clothes
for a while, haven't you?

39:59.845 --> 40:01.646
Yeah, a little bit now.

40:01.746 --> 40:05.752
You really shouldn't stand downwind
of a person with a stench like that.

40:08.370 --> 40:10.872
There's some clothes up there.

40:10.972 --> 40:15.213
Help yourself to what you need
and wash up in the pond.

40:17.077 --> 40:20.866
And by the way,
don't be lurking around in the shadows.

40:20.966 --> 40:24.037
A person can get shot
for a lot less than that.

40:27.155 --> 40:29.027
Darn city folks.

40:31.808 --> 40:33.679
Good. Where are they?

40:33.779 --> 40:38.380
Headed west. This camera's on
a train platform. 319 to Calgary.

40:38.549 --> 40:41.050
So they could've followed it
to the end of the line.

40:41.150 --> 40:44.222
Or they never got on the train at all.

40:44.322 --> 40:46.280
She looked right at the camera.

40:46.380 --> 40:50.060
That's how I picked her up so fast.
Clean facial recognition.

40:52.579 --> 40:56.351
- What about the vial?
- I'm still working on it.

40:56.601 --> 40:57.936
You leaving already?

40:58.036 --> 41:00.553
Yeah, I hate being bored.
Plus, we're running out of time.

41:00.653 --> 41:03.139
We're not the only ones
trying to bring them in.

41:16.837 --> 41:19.088
I thought you were on a diet.

41:20.943 --> 41:24.994
When the world ends,
delicacies like this...

41:26.281 --> 41:28.665
they're the first to go.

41:30.418 --> 41:33.988
So do you think we should tell them?
Warn them about what's coming?

41:34.088 --> 41:37.872
No. Ignorance is bliss.

41:39.727 --> 41:42.878
- It means that...
- I know what it means.

41:48.702 --> 41:53.798
I have something I want you to look at.
I came bearing gifts.

41:56.743 --> 41:59.262
They took a train west.

42:03.483 --> 42:07.704
- How did you get this?
- Information is what I'm paid for.

42:09.424 --> 42:14.343
For instance, I know that that's not
the first time you're seeing those photos.

42:15.028 --> 42:17.080
Is it?

42:17.682 --> 42:22.567
Look, I don't blame you for keeping
information from me, okay?

42:23.003 --> 42:25.239
The agency's falling apart around us.

42:25.339 --> 42:29.359
You don't want to trust me
or anyone else. I get that.

42:29.810 --> 42:35.096
Look, it's no secret you tend to know more
information than your pay grade allows.

42:35.850 --> 42:39.001
So I need to know how much time I have.

42:40.554 --> 42:44.228
Time? That's a great question.

42:44.992 --> 42:48.311
By "time" do you mean
the time before Gate,

42:48.411 --> 42:52.266
the "Global Anti-Terrorist Entity..."

42:52.915 --> 42:55.467
rips itself apart?

42:55.837 --> 42:59.740
Or by "time" do you mean the time
we have before the virus is released,

42:59.840 --> 43:03.274
killing everyone and everything we love.

43:15.489 --> 43:18.714
<i>You want to make a difference
in this world, Jake.</i>

43:18.814 --> 43:20.760
<i>You're hoping for a chance
to prove yourself.</i>

43:20.860 --> 43:23.463
<i>Whatever you hope to have here is dead.</i>

43:23.563 --> 43:26.334
<i>But I promise you, if you come with me,</i>

43:26.434 --> 43:28.769
<i>you'll be able to do
some good in this world.</i>

43:28.869 --> 43:31.121
<i>Maybe even save it.</i>

43:41.214 --> 43:43.151
Time to wake up, Jake.

43:43.251 --> 43:46.119
- What time is it?
- Time to go to work.

43:46.219 --> 43:49.124
Did you think you were going
to get to stay here for free?

43:49.224 --> 43:53.475
If a man don't work, he don't eat.
Or get to stay in the RV.

43:54.093 --> 43:56.645
I'll see you up at the house
in five minutes.

44:08.710 --> 44:11.093
Go get 'em, tiger.

44:12.579 --> 44:15.583
Tell me what's going on.
What'd you mean "him"? Who's "him"?

44:15.683 --> 44:18.118
Who did you find?

44:18.218 --> 44:20.536
I'll be there in 20.

44:35.736 --> 44:38.340
- Where'd they find him?
- We got a tip from upstate.

44:38.440 --> 44:41.809
They were trying to move him out
of the country. Twelve causalities.

44:41.909 --> 44:44.310
State your name.

44:44.410 --> 44:47.196
Eric O'Conner.

44:52.086 --> 44:54.388
All right, Mr. O'Conner.

44:54.488 --> 44:56.756
Who were those men that were with you?

44:56.856 --> 44:59.002
I don't know.

44:59.225 --> 45:02.610
- Where were they taking you?
- I don't know.

45:03.030 --> 45:06.166
Well, why did they want you specifically?

45:06.266 --> 45:09.237
Because I created it.

45:09.337 --> 45:11.421
Created what?

45:12.806 --> 45:14.841
The virus.

45:15.241 --> 45:16.892
Strain 31.

45:18.311 --> 45:20.762
You know about the virus?

45:23.818 --> 45:27.102
It's not exactly the world's
best-kept secret, Eric.

45:28.490 --> 45:30.772
Why did you create the virus?

45:31.391 --> 45:36.333
It wasn't my intent.
I was creating a cure for mankind.

45:36.433 --> 45:41.485
It was designed to kill mutated cells
and leave the rest of the body unharmed.

45:42.203 --> 45:45.839
Cancer, auto-immune disorders...

45:46.239 --> 45:47.608
gone.

45:47.708 --> 45:52.427
- I'm guessing that's not what happened.
- No. It just kills everything.

45:52.914 --> 45:55.082
What are they planning on doing
with the virus now?

45:55.182 --> 45:58.685
Listen, I just want to see my family.

45:58.785 --> 46:03.437
I just want to talk to them.
Let me call them, let me talk to them.

46:04.825 --> 46:07.327
We do not do good cop-bad cop here.

46:07.427 --> 46:10.056
I am both.
If you do not answer my questions

46:10.156 --> 46:14.316
I promise you I will get up out of this chair
and I will kill your family myself.

46:18.205 --> 46:20.823
I've already done that, Robert.

46:23.075 --> 46:27.147
Disease... is the last dragon of our time.

46:27.247 --> 46:29.965
A dragon I wanted to slay.

46:33.118 --> 46:34.887
But instead...

46:34.987 --> 46:37.139
I created a monster.

46:39.959 --> 46:41.895
Okay, I don't know what you just said,

46:41.995 --> 46:45.214
so I'm going to make this
really simple for you.

46:45.833 --> 46:50.137
Do you know where the cure is,
and if you don't, can you recreate it?

46:50.237 --> 46:55.310
Have you been listening?
The antidote was a one-in-a-billion fluke!

46:55.410 --> 46:58.177
A strand of DNA that by mere chance

46:58.277 --> 47:00.848
interrupts the genetic code of the virus.

47:00.948 --> 47:03.484
I can't recreate that research.

47:03.584 --> 47:06.453
Well, that's not what I want
to hear Mr. O'Conner.

47:06.553 --> 47:11.558
We cannot protect you
if you do not cooperate with us.

47:11.658 --> 47:13.927
You can't protect me?

47:14.427 --> 47:16.797
You can't protect yourselves.

47:17.197 --> 47:19.281
I'm sorry.

47:19.800 --> 47:22.302
If we find the cure...

47:22.402 --> 47:24.754
can you duplicate it?

47:25.906 --> 47:27.524
Yes.

47:29.541 --> 47:31.412
All right then, Eric.

47:31.512 --> 47:35.716
I hope we find that cure so that you can be
remembered as the one who slayed the dragon

47:35.816 --> 47:38.401
and not the one who created the monster.

47:41.321 --> 47:43.791
If you can't find that cure,

47:43.891 --> 47:46.709
then I won't be remembered at all.

48:23.195 --> 48:25.413
Still got that phone?

48:27.099 --> 48:29.518
Yeah, it might come in handy.

48:32.506 --> 48:34.474
What's up?

48:34.574 --> 48:36.910
Henry's going into town tonight.

48:37.010 --> 48:39.662
I was wondering if you wanted to go.

48:43.983 --> 48:46.220
Why would I want to go into town?

48:46.320 --> 48:48.088
- We cannot keep on doing this!
- Doing what?

48:48.188 --> 48:52.193
- Pretend everything's okay. Yes, we are!
- We're not pretending everything is okay!

48:52.793 --> 48:54.027
Whatever.

48:54.127 --> 48:58.446
Then what'd you want me to do, Emily?
I'm trying to make things right.

49:01.667 --> 49:04.954
You know what... just go.

49:21.954 --> 49:24.026
I'm sorry.

49:28.962 --> 49:32.280
- I just don't want to lose you.
- You're not going to lose me.

49:34.066 --> 49:36.384
I feel like I already have.

49:56.155 --> 49:58.006
Ange, you here?

50:07.368 --> 50:09.584
What's going on?

50:10.637 --> 50:13.155
Why don't you put your gun away?

50:17.277 --> 50:21.348
- Why are you here?
- I made you, Chase.

50:21.698 --> 50:24.749
And I do not appreciate being lied to.

50:26.053 --> 50:29.889
- So we need to resolve some things.
- Resolve what?

50:29.989 --> 50:33.774
Things like teamwork. Trust.

50:34.461 --> 50:36.345
Accountability.

50:38.732 --> 50:42.083
I'm not leaving
until you tell me where she is.

50:46.507 --> 50:48.257
Okay.

50:49.209 --> 50:51.425
I'll tell you where they are.

50:52.645 --> 50:55.229
But on the condition that I go in alone.

50:56.516 --> 50:58.766
Good boy, Chase.

51:03.990 --> 51:08.043
Follow him.
If he gives you a hard time, take him out.

51:40.259 --> 51:42.429
So why'd you pick us up?

51:42.529 --> 51:46.081
If you don't quit your jabbering,
we're never going to catch anything.

51:48.101 --> 51:50.837
I picked you up because you looked
like you need some help.

51:50.937 --> 51:54.374
I believe if it's in your power
to do good, then you do good.

51:54.474 --> 51:58.896
Plain and simple.
And you remind me of my son.

51:58.996 --> 52:03.149
- You had a son.
- I did. Years ago.

52:03.249 --> 52:05.416
What happened to him?

52:05.516 --> 52:07.635
I was so proud of him.

52:08.554 --> 52:10.938
The day he shipped off, I...

52:13.026 --> 52:15.744
He looked so sharp in his uniform.

52:17.898 --> 52:19.867
He never came home.

52:19.967 --> 52:22.451
That's the last time I ever saw him.

52:24.538 --> 52:27.389
And you, you're running
from something bad...

52:28.540 --> 52:31.343
but as a man you have
something inside you.

52:31.443 --> 52:33.661
It's called a choice.

52:34.248 --> 52:37.072
Don't ever let anybody
take that away from you.

52:51.931 --> 52:54.299
- Yeah?
- Why'd you tell him?

52:54.399 --> 52:57.044
If we don't play be his rules
the game is over.

52:57.504 --> 53:00.473
<i>Are you sure
we're even on the right side here?</i>

53:00.573 --> 53:01.774
What'd you mean?

53:01.874 --> 53:06.043
<i>There's something more going on, Chase.
There's something that they're not telling us.</i>

53:06.943 --> 53:09.230
Just watch your back.

53:57.863 --> 54:00.314
So what do you remember?

54:06.071 --> 54:08.407
Fragments. Like...

54:08.707 --> 54:11.125
flashes of something.

54:11.611 --> 54:15.496
A few words. Faces. But...

54:16.116 --> 54:18.284
I don't know where any of it goes.

54:18.384 --> 54:20.421
I don't know how it fits.

54:22.223 --> 54:26.508
Kind of like trying to put a puzzle together
without the picture on the box.

54:27.126 --> 54:29.645
Yeah. Something like that.

54:31.998 --> 54:34.815
Your friend,
has she been able to help you?

54:36.169 --> 54:37.536
No.

54:37.636 --> 54:40.219
Yeah, that's the funny thing about women.

54:41.075 --> 54:44.091
They might see the same story we do,

54:44.677 --> 54:48.997
when they remember it, it sounds
like something completely different.

54:50.181 --> 54:52.017
That's why I never remarried.

54:52.117 --> 54:55.622
There's too much this,
"she said, he said, they said."

54:55.722 --> 55:00.174
Can't remember what anybody said.
This way it's just what I said.

55:01.795 --> 55:04.111
That seems pretty lonely.

55:05.063 --> 55:06.566
Yeah, but...

55:06.666 --> 55:10.685
sometimes I just pick up crazy people
on the side of the road.

55:11.637 --> 55:13.955
See if I can fix 'em up.

55:14.273 --> 55:16.675
And how's that working you for you?

55:17.175 --> 55:19.427
Scary stuff.

55:22.849 --> 55:25.581
It's a dangerous place you're in.

55:26.186 --> 55:28.559
If a man don't know who he is or...

55:28.659 --> 55:30.938
where he came from...

55:31.625 --> 55:34.509
anybody can tell him what his purpose is.

55:46.637 --> 55:49.088
Looks like it might clear up.

55:53.412 --> 55:55.026
Sit down, sit down.

56:16.434 --> 56:20.006
Keep pressure on it, all right.
Keep pressure on your wound, all right?

56:20.106 --> 56:23.158
Stay with me, all right?
Hey, keep your eyes open.

56:24.810 --> 56:27.228
I knew you'd be trouble.

58:40.611 --> 58:44.898
<i>Civilian down. Reaper has made contact
with target and is engaged.</i>

01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:11.002
Jake!

01:00:12.204 --> 01:00:13.753
Jacob!

01:00:14.806 --> 01:00:17.092
Jacob, answer me!

01:00:27.987 --> 01:00:30.270
Sorry, beautiful...

01:00:30.988 --> 01:00:33.773
but I just couldn't risk you shooting me.

01:00:34.426 --> 01:00:37.622
We can take it from here, Chase.
Drop the gun.

01:00:42.367 --> 01:00:46.687
- Hello, John.
- Pick her up and bring her into the house.

01:00:47.271 --> 01:00:51.492
- Carry her yourself.
- I'd prefer if you did it.

01:00:57.615 --> 01:01:00.067
Put her in the chair and tie her up.

01:01:10.695 --> 01:01:13.580
- Now what?
- Now we wait.

01:01:20.806 --> 01:01:23.495
This is how you're going to end it, John?
With my back turned?

01:01:23.595 --> 01:01:27.593
You're going to shoot me in the back?
That's how you're going to finish this?

01:01:41.076 --> 01:01:43.997
How did you know?
How did you know I was here?

01:01:48.863 --> 01:01:51.970
- You son of a...
- Chase.

01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:54.295
Glad you could make it.

01:01:54.805 --> 01:01:58.891
- I told you to let me deal with this.
- We did let you take care of it.

01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:01.794
There she is.

01:02:07.836 --> 01:02:11.246
Can someone wake her up?
I want to talk to her.

01:02:23.234 --> 01:02:26.652
- Where am I?
- You're in good company, Emily Keller.

01:02:27.487 --> 01:02:29.490
Who are you?

01:02:29.590 --> 01:02:33.681
I'm a friend of your father's.
I'm very sorry about your loss.

01:02:36.782 --> 01:02:40.343
I know who you are,
and you are no friend of my father's!

01:02:42.052 --> 01:02:44.337
So then you know what I'm after.

01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:47.958
He had something.

01:02:48.058 --> 01:02:51.130
And he would've given it
to somebody he trusted.

01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:53.446
Maybe a friend.

01:02:53.764 --> 01:02:55.841
Or family.

01:02:56.001 --> 01:02:58.384
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:02:59.338 --> 01:03:03.623
Yes, you do, Emily.
I can see it in your eyes.

01:03:04.042 --> 01:03:07.061
He told you about the cure, didn't he?

01:03:10.213 --> 01:03:12.765
You're never going to get it.

01:03:13.083 --> 01:03:16.167
So you do know what I'm talking about.

01:03:21.927 --> 01:03:25.412
Why don't you save us from all
the trouble of hurting you...

01:03:25.531 --> 01:03:27.813
and tell us what we want to know?

01:03:35.474 --> 01:03:38.043
Before we begin, remember,

01:03:38.143 --> 01:03:40.811
the ending is always the same.

01:03:41.211 --> 01:03:43.429
It never changes.

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:58.863
You're not seriously
going to do this, are you?

01:03:58.963 --> 01:04:01.614
Chase, she's a terrorist.

01:04:08.339 --> 01:04:10.557
Where is it, Emily?

01:04:22.119 --> 01:04:25.155
I need you to tell me where it is.

01:04:25.255 --> 01:04:28.226
And I will do whatever it takes
to get what I want.

01:04:46.711 --> 01:04:50.881
I don't know. I don't know, I swear
I don't know where it is! I wasn't there!

01:04:51.181 --> 01:04:53.850
- Who was!
- I don't know! I don't know! I swear!

01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:57.004
- I swear!
- Who was there?

01:05:11.901 --> 01:05:14.602
Who was there?

01:05:18.642 --> 01:05:20.311
Jacob.

01:05:20.711 --> 01:05:22.995
Jacob was.

01:05:24.081 --> 01:05:28.668
And he's going to kill
every single one of you!

01:05:29.954 --> 01:05:32.237
Oh, is he now?

01:05:42.367 --> 01:05:44.756
I want you to tell me who this Jacob is.

01:05:44.856 --> 01:05:48.221
I already told you, he's a nobody.

01:05:49.472 --> 01:05:52.377
What are you not telling me here, Chase?

01:05:52.477 --> 01:05:56.348
Whatever it is, it's going to cost you.

01:05:57.348 --> 01:05:58.899
John.

01:06:12.062 --> 01:06:16.635
I want to help you, Emily.
This is... it's going too far.

01:06:17.035 --> 01:06:19.969
Just... let me go.

01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:21.624
Where's Jacob?

01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:29.396
I need to know what this is.

01:06:30.631 --> 01:06:33.183
Is this the virus?

01:06:33.918 --> 01:06:35.912
Is this the cure?

01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:43.144
I need you to start talking, Emily.
We're running out of time.

01:06:47.265 --> 01:06:48.816
Fine.

01:06:49.767 --> 01:06:54.453
We're going to find out what this is,
one way or the other.

01:06:54.806 --> 01:06:57.007
So I'm going to ask you
one more time, Emily,

01:06:57.107 --> 01:07:00.567
is this the virus or is this the cure?

01:07:02.311 --> 01:07:05.516
Is this the virus or is this the cure?

01:07:05.616 --> 01:07:09.036
Is this the virus or is this the cure?

01:07:13.759 --> 01:07:16.443
Who do you think Jacob is?

01:07:16.543 --> 01:07:20.931
Do you know him? I mean, do you really
know him? 'Cause I don't think you do.

01:07:21.031 --> 01:07:23.102
He's not your boyfriend, Emily.

01:07:23.602 --> 01:07:26.837
In fact, he's not anything
that you think he is.

01:07:26.937 --> 01:07:30.475
You need to stop trying
to protect him, Emily.

01:07:30.575 --> 01:07:35.145
You need to stop trying to protect him,
because he works for me.

01:07:35.745 --> 01:07:37.698
He's on my side.

01:07:41.116 --> 01:07:42.935
I know.

01:07:45.156 --> 01:07:47.404
But does he know that?

01:08:01.539 --> 01:08:03.741
- <i>We've got a problem.</i>
- What is it?

01:08:03.841 --> 01:08:05.409
<i>I found out what that compound is.</i>

01:08:05.509 --> 01:08:08.880
<i>It's a beta-blocker for people
with post-traumatic stress disorder.</i>

01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:12.314
- In English.
- <i>It's used to make people forget.</i>

01:08:12.414 --> 01:08:15.952
- Forget what?
- <i>Everything.</i>

01:08:16.051 --> 01:08:19.823
So it's possible the person who was
injected doesn't know who they are?

01:08:19.923 --> 01:08:21.974
<i>That's right.</i>

01:08:27.298 --> 01:08:31.850
I'm very sorry to tell you, Emily,
but your Jacob is already dead.

01:08:33.403 --> 01:08:36.386
What do you mean he's dead?
What did you do?

01:08:36.487 --> 01:08:39.511
- I did nothing.
- What did you do with Jacob?

01:08:40.212 --> 01:08:42.868
Why am I beginning to think
that there's a lot more to this Jacob

01:08:42.968 --> 01:08:45.277
than you're telling me?

01:08:47.951 --> 01:08:51.673
Unit one, we need Jacob alive. Copy.

01:08:52.875 --> 01:08:56.625
Unit one, we need Jacob alive. Copy.

01:08:57.444 --> 01:09:01.205
Unit one, we need Jacob alive. Copy.

01:10:46.368 --> 01:10:47.886
Hey!

01:11:20.071 --> 01:11:24.122
Jake. Jake, you don't know what's going on.
Whatever she told you...

01:11:26.710 --> 01:11:28.993
Are you okay?

01:11:38.923 --> 01:11:42.460
I need you to brace yourself.
This is going to hurt, okay?

01:11:43.159 --> 01:11:46.758
On three. One, two, three!

01:12:15.658 --> 01:12:18.142
If he moves, kill him.

01:12:27.237 --> 01:12:29.741
You gotta listen, you gotta listen to me.

01:12:30.241 --> 01:12:33.591
You don't know what's going on.
Look, you can't...

01:12:37.881 --> 01:12:40.866
It's okay. It's okay.

01:12:41.518 --> 01:12:44.837
It's over now. It's okay.

01:12:47.589 --> 01:12:50.360
It's okay. I got you.

01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:53.077
I got you now.

01:12:56.850 --> 01:12:59.601
Look at me, look at me.

01:12:59.701 --> 01:13:01.336
It's all over.

01:13:07.109 --> 01:13:09.193
Not yet.

01:13:35.339 --> 01:13:39.425
I didn't want to rush this, Jake,
but I'm running out of time.

01:13:40.042 --> 01:13:42.126
You know?

01:13:42.912 --> 01:13:45.530
I thought you were going
to piece it all together.

01:13:45.631 --> 01:13:48.586
<i>But I promise you, if you come with me,</i>

01:13:48.686 --> 01:13:51.087
<i>you'll be able to do
some good in this world.</i>

01:13:51.187 --> 01:13:53.423
- Maybe even save it.
- Who are you?

01:13:53.523 --> 01:13:55.517
I'm your second chance.

01:13:57.027 --> 01:14:01.447
I thought you were going to piece it
all together, or just walk away.

01:14:02.365 --> 01:14:05.819
You've got something that I want.
Where is it?

01:14:06.769 --> 01:14:09.021
I can't give it to you.

01:14:09.473 --> 01:14:12.442
I'm not going to lie to you, Jake,
this isn't going to end well!

01:14:12.542 --> 01:14:15.694
But you are going to tell me
what I want to know.

01:14:16.125 --> 01:14:18.881
We searched my father's room for days,
Jake, and we couldn't find the cure,

01:14:18.981 --> 01:14:21.267
so you hid it really well.

01:14:24.186 --> 01:14:27.157
- Where should I shoot him, Jake?
- Emily, don't.

01:14:27.257 --> 01:14:32.161
- In the arm?
- Please! Emily! Don't do it.

01:14:32.561 --> 01:14:36.331
Tell me where it is, Jake, or he dies too.

01:14:46.509 --> 01:14:48.944
This can all end, Jake.

01:14:49.044 --> 01:14:51.629
Just tell me where it is.

01:14:52.716 --> 01:14:56.019
<i>This world is going
to tear itself apart, Jacob.</i>

01:14:56.119 --> 01:14:57.921
<i>If we sit by and allow it to happen,</i>

01:14:58.021 --> 01:15:01.223
<i>there will be no one and nothing
left to rise from the ashes.</i>

01:15:01.323 --> 01:15:04.595
<i>...rise from the ashes.
...rise from the ashes.</i>

01:15:04.695 --> 01:15:07.663
<i>This is how we can control our rebirth.</i>

01:15:09.063 --> 01:15:11.482
<i>To do it by design.</i>

01:15:12.602 --> 01:15:14.953
Just tell me where it is.

01:15:19.176 --> 01:15:20.726
No.

01:15:42.966 --> 01:15:47.104
You can do this. Get in,
get close, find the cure, get out.

01:15:47.504 --> 01:15:49.058
What about my cover?

01:15:49.158 --> 01:15:53.009
You don't need one. We're off the books
on this. No time for a fake back-story.

01:15:53.109 --> 01:15:56.432
Use your real name,
and get to know the daughter.

01:15:57.513 --> 01:15:59.646
It's just you and me on this one.

01:16:03.353 --> 01:16:05.803
I'll see you on the other side.

01:16:10.727 --> 01:16:14.713
Jacob! That's quite the run you had.

01:16:15.932 --> 01:16:18.200
You must be getting sick of needles.

01:16:21.971 --> 01:16:25.209
Don't worry, I'm not allowed to kill you.

01:16:25.309 --> 01:16:27.243
Just a little adrenaline.

01:16:27.343 --> 01:16:29.378
You need to be awake
for what's about to happen.

01:16:29.478 --> 01:16:33.198
You need to be awake
for what's about to happen.

01:16:37.086 --> 01:16:41.072
- I thought you were dead.
- Do I look dead?

01:16:53.501 --> 01:16:57.406
Hey, Jacob. Are you there?

01:16:57.806 --> 01:17:00.209
Hey, can you hear me?

01:17:00.309 --> 01:17:03.024
Hey. Jacob.

01:17:03.579 --> 01:17:05.964
I knew they'd send somebody.

01:17:07.016 --> 01:17:09.604
I never expected it would be you.

01:17:10.236 --> 01:17:12.420
Morgan, don't.

01:17:21.298 --> 01:17:23.932
You aren't going to shoot, Jacob.

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:29.172
I know what Emily means to you.
You care too much for her.

01:17:29.772 --> 01:17:32.074
I'll do what I have to do.

01:17:32.174 --> 01:17:34.392
Now give me the cure.

01:17:37.146 --> 01:17:39.351
Who are you waiting for?

01:17:41.351 --> 01:17:43.601
They're not coming.

01:17:44.621 --> 01:17:46.085
What do you think is happening here?

01:17:46.185 --> 01:17:48.873
I think you're going to kill
millions of people.

01:17:48.973 --> 01:17:52.994
When was the last time
you really looked at your world, son?

01:17:54.595 --> 01:17:57.466
Everyday there are new wars breaking out.

01:17:57.566 --> 01:18:02.372
Children soldiers. Individuals buying
and selling one another for a profit.

01:18:02.472 --> 01:18:05.508
Holy wars! Invasions! Retaliations!

01:18:05.608 --> 01:18:08.576
We are locked in a downward spiral.

01:18:08.676 --> 01:18:10.228
This...

01:18:12.414 --> 01:18:15.498
this isn't about a disease.

01:18:16.619 --> 01:18:19.077
This is a saving grace.

01:18:23.059 --> 01:18:26.294
This world is going
to tear itself apart, Jacob.

01:18:26.694 --> 01:18:29.724
If we sit by and allow it to happen,
then there will be no one

01:18:29.824 --> 01:18:33.852
and nothing left to rise
from the ashes. But this...

01:18:35.905 --> 01:18:39.274
this is how we control our rebirth.

01:18:39.974 --> 01:18:42.277
To do it by design.

01:18:42.377 --> 01:18:43.912
- It doesn't work like that.
- No?

01:18:44.012 --> 01:18:48.127
Killing people because they don't fit your
plan isn't a fresh start. That's genocide.

01:18:48.227 --> 01:18:51.869
It's inevitable! We will self-destruct!

01:18:53.122 --> 01:18:56.530
But this way, we accomplish it
without the nuclear winter.

01:18:57.726 --> 01:19:00.396
Without the aftermath of war.

01:19:00.696 --> 01:19:03.982
One world... united.

01:19:04.232 --> 01:19:06.002
Do you hear yourself, Morgan?

01:19:06.102 --> 01:19:10.974
You will be responsible for the death of
billions of people. Is that what you want?

01:19:11.624 --> 01:19:14.976
We'll pave the way for a new utopia.

01:19:16.679 --> 01:19:21.232
When the dust settles, all races
and religions will come together.

01:19:22.917 --> 01:19:26.804
And those that don't?
What happens to them?

01:19:28.823 --> 01:19:31.440
When they look back on this day...

01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:35.214
we will be remembered as heroes.

01:19:36.965 --> 01:19:38.541
No.

01:19:39.668 --> 01:19:41.752
No, Senator.

01:19:43.705 --> 01:19:47.397
You will be remembered as a madman.

01:19:51.612 --> 01:19:53.830
Think about Emily.

01:19:56.319 --> 01:19:58.852
Of the life you could have together.

01:20:04.326 --> 01:20:05.976
I am.

01:20:28.984 --> 01:20:31.468
Please take care of her.

01:20:33.856 --> 01:20:36.382
Make sure she survives.

01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:00.448
Hey. Jacob.

01:21:00.848 --> 01:21:03.919
Hey, can you hear me? Jacob.

01:21:04.019 --> 01:21:07.670
Hey. Look up. What happened?

01:21:14.095 --> 01:21:16.168
I found it.

01:21:17.132 --> 01:21:20.708
After six long months,

01:21:20.808 --> 01:21:22.875
I found it.

01:21:24.405 --> 01:21:26.407
But they also found me.

01:21:26.507 --> 01:21:31.228
Somehow, the senator figured out
I was working with you.

01:21:43.057 --> 01:21:45.642
They put me in a hole for three days.

01:21:47.062 --> 01:21:50.732
But when I came to, she was there.

01:21:51.232 --> 01:21:55.652
And all I could remember
was how much I cared about her.

01:21:57.238 --> 01:21:59.642
Then why did she wipe your memory?

01:22:00.342 --> 01:22:03.572
So you'd know what it would
feel like to be betrayed.

01:22:14.088 --> 01:22:16.089
Looks like deja vu.

01:22:17.059 --> 01:22:19.377
You were good, Jake.

01:22:19.862 --> 01:22:22.231
My father told me to trust nobody,

01:22:22.331 --> 01:22:24.466
but I thought you were different.

01:22:24.566 --> 01:22:27.601
I hate to break it to you,
but your father was a maniac.

01:22:27.701 --> 01:22:29.404
Is that why you killed him?

01:22:29.504 --> 01:22:33.089
Is that what you want? A confession?

01:22:33.208 --> 01:22:36.513
Well, here it is,
I killed your father, Emily.

01:22:36.613 --> 01:22:40.814
I killed your father because he
was going to kill millions of people.

01:22:42.049 --> 01:22:44.302
You know, Jake...

01:22:46.687 --> 01:22:51.072
You can shoot a man
clean through here, and he'll survive.

01:22:51.172 --> 01:22:53.935
Unless he loses too much blood.

01:22:54.497 --> 01:22:57.900
I told you, you'd wish you were dead.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.670
Minus the bullet wound,
I feel pretty good.

01:23:00.770 --> 01:23:03.261
That's 'cause I'm not done with you yet!

01:23:08.876 --> 01:23:11.127
Put the gun down, Emily.

01:23:12.513 --> 01:23:14.965
Dead guys are dead ends.

01:23:27.028 --> 01:23:29.313
What happened to your hand?

01:23:30.464 --> 01:23:32.938
You never said I'd be getting tortured.

01:23:33.168 --> 01:23:36.404
Yeah, well, David's been
a little unpredictable lately.

01:23:36.504 --> 01:23:38.889
I told you not to trust anyone.

01:23:40.475 --> 01:23:45.527
I'm assuming you've got the cure, given
our friends here have been enlightened.

01:23:50.285 --> 01:23:51.605
So you don't have it?

01:23:51.705 --> 01:23:55.147
Let's put a nail through your hand
and see how you do.

01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:58.427
By the way, you're late.

01:23:58.527 --> 01:24:01.545
- I had to make a call.
- A call?

01:24:02.230 --> 01:24:04.982
What was so fricking important?

01:24:06.401 --> 01:24:09.555
I needed to know whether I was
supposed to kill you or not.

01:24:10.206 --> 01:24:11.239
No!

01:24:23.050 --> 01:24:25.365
What the hell are you doing?

01:24:27.254 --> 01:24:29.090
Come on, guys,

01:24:29.190 --> 01:24:32.170
you can't tell me you didn't
want to do that yourselves.

01:24:33.662 --> 01:24:36.013
Somebody clean this up!

01:24:50.712 --> 01:24:53.566
I'm sorry, where are my manners?

01:24:56.051 --> 01:24:58.268
My name is Robert Daniels.

01:24:58.688 --> 01:25:02.423
I'm an agent at Gate,
coworker of Chase Williams.

01:25:02.523 --> 01:25:04.826
Well, at least I was.

01:25:05.226 --> 01:25:08.205
Chase thinks he can save the world
from the impending storm.

01:25:08.305 --> 01:25:10.065
Well, I don't share
his delusions of grandeur.

01:25:10.165 --> 01:25:13.636
I don't think there's any benefit
in going down with the ship.

01:25:13.736 --> 01:25:16.572
Now, Emily and I had a deal, and she
didn't hold up her end of that deal,

01:25:16.672 --> 01:25:18.405
so here's what I'm going to do.

01:25:18.505 --> 01:25:21.292
I'm going to extend that offer to you.

01:25:22.177 --> 01:25:26.415
You give me the cure, and I'll make sure
your name gets on that list.

01:25:26.915 --> 01:25:30.751
Think of it as the manifesto
for the new world.

01:25:30.851 --> 01:25:33.622
Why do you want the cure
if you already have it?

01:25:33.922 --> 01:25:36.610
A bird in the hand
is worth two in the bush.

01:25:37.259 --> 01:25:40.673
It means you just realized
you sold your soul for nothing.

01:25:44.099 --> 01:25:47.301
Okay, hey, hey! All right, I'll tell you.

01:25:49.738 --> 01:25:54.658
But first, you need to tell me something.
How did the senator figure out who I was?

01:26:03.201 --> 01:26:06.489
I never trusted Chase,
so I had him followed.

01:26:06.856 --> 01:26:10.881
Imagine my surprise when I found out
that Senator Keller's bodyguard

01:26:10.981 --> 01:26:13.394
was also a Gate agent.

01:26:13.494 --> 01:26:17.231
Then this is all your fault.
This is because of you!

01:26:17.331 --> 01:26:18.667
No, you did that yourself.

01:26:18.767 --> 01:26:22.619
And you need to be more careful
about who you're seen with in public.

01:26:24.672 --> 01:26:27.137
Now it's your move, Agent Bradley.

01:26:28.476 --> 01:26:30.390
I can't give it to you.

01:26:31.396 --> 01:26:33.315
I'll give you one minute
before I shoot again.

01:26:33.415 --> 01:26:36.584
First guy to give me what I need
doesn't get the next bullet.

01:26:36.684 --> 01:26:39.053
- Where's the cure?
- I can't give it to you.

01:26:39.153 --> 01:26:41.223
- Tell me where it is!
- I can't give it to you.

01:26:41.323 --> 01:26:44.941
- Why?
- Because it's in me!

01:26:46.628 --> 01:26:50.162
When you told them who I was,
I had no way out.

01:26:50.262 --> 01:26:53.316
So I injected myself.

01:27:00.875 --> 01:27:03.211
Congratulations, Agent Bradley.

01:27:03.311 --> 01:27:06.196
You've successfully taken
Senator Keller's place.

01:27:06.481 --> 01:27:09.615
- Too bad that cure won't stop a bullet.
- No, Robert, stop! Stop!

01:27:09.715 --> 01:27:15.105
We can still do this.
You remember Eric O'Conner.

01:27:15.958 --> 01:27:20.744
He said if we could find the cure,
he could duplicate it.

01:27:21.563 --> 01:27:26.751
I mean, what if... what if he can
isolate it in his blood stream?

01:27:28.403 --> 01:27:32.706
I mean, if he has a workable strain,
we can do this.

01:27:32.806 --> 01:27:37.160
- All right, but we... we need him.
- That's the best you've got.

01:27:38.213 --> 01:27:40.396
Jake, you with me?

01:27:40.849 --> 01:27:44.318
I need to know
you can handle this, all right?

01:27:44.418 --> 01:27:48.055
- That you're not in too deep.
- What do you want from him?

01:27:51.792 --> 01:27:54.244
To finish what he started.

01:28:26.961 --> 01:28:30.369
One day... one day
you're going to thank me.

01:28:38.473 --> 01:28:40.874
We gotta get you back to Gate.

01:28:40.974 --> 01:28:44.127
We found the scientist, but... come on!

01:28:46.381 --> 01:28:48.697
You've got to be kidding me.

01:28:56.057 --> 01:28:59.154
Come on. Come on!

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:04.247
- I'm gonna kill him!
- Less talking, more shooting.

01:29:09.435 --> 01:29:10.933
Come on!

01:29:12.573 --> 01:29:14.891
Angela. It's Chase.

01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:18.232
No, I need... I need you to listen.
I'm with Jacob.

01:29:18.332 --> 01:29:21.582
Are you gonna track this phone?
He injected himself with the cure.

01:29:21.682 --> 01:29:26.061
The cure is in his bloodstream. I need you
to get the medical team and scientists.

01:29:26.161 --> 01:29:29.186
We're on our way
to the RC hangar right now.

01:29:29.657 --> 01:29:33.867
And Robert is the mole.
Robert is the mole!

01:29:34.396 --> 01:29:37.124
- Come on, you got to lose them! Go!
- Yeah, I'm trying!

01:29:48.675 --> 01:29:50.477
- We're losing them!
- I can drive!

01:29:50.577 --> 01:29:52.595
We're losing them!

01:30:10.264 --> 01:30:13.067
Okay, you're going to go up here, go left.

01:30:13.167 --> 01:30:15.929
Your first left, go straight.
They'll be right there.

01:30:50.337 --> 01:30:54.196
Come on, come on. We gotta go.
We gotta go. Come on, get up.

01:30:56.209 --> 01:30:58.493
Get in the field. Get in the field.

01:31:12.861 --> 01:31:15.629
This is not my fault, bro.
This car came out of nowhere.

01:31:15.729 --> 01:31:17.631
Look at my truck, man.
Have you seen my truck?

01:31:17.731 --> 01:31:21.035
The guy pulled his buddy out,
then dragged him through the field.

01:31:21.485 --> 01:31:22.849
I don't know.

01:31:26.774 --> 01:31:29.357
Yo, I'm calling the cops, man.

01:31:44.059 --> 01:31:48.387
Hey, Chase, you can't run from me forever!

01:31:50.465 --> 01:31:54.384
This whole "make it up as you go" plan
isn't working out well for you, guy!

01:32:48.088 --> 01:32:51.635
- We gotta get to the hospital.
- Yeah, no kidding.

01:32:53.259 --> 01:32:56.765
Here's the plan. I'm going to go back,
draw them further in.

01:32:56.865 --> 01:32:58.946
You just wait here.

01:32:59.046 --> 01:33:02.460
- That's your plan?
- We only have one gun.

01:33:04.204 --> 01:33:08.242
Look, just don't let them get past you.

01:33:08.642 --> 01:33:11.589
- All right?
- Okay.

01:33:27.828 --> 01:33:31.846
Hey, waffles, I think it's time to talk!

01:33:34.001 --> 01:33:35.935
Let me guess, Chase,

01:33:36.035 --> 01:33:39.450
this is the part where you try
and strike a deal with me.

01:33:39.550 --> 01:33:41.242
Yeah, I got a deal.

01:33:41.342 --> 01:33:45.379
How about a beach house, two wives,
maybe one that's always ready to go?

01:33:45.479 --> 01:33:49.564
Maybe a glass of water? How about
getting out of this corn, how's that sound?

01:33:52.387 --> 01:33:55.089
Well, I'll tell you what, Chase,

01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:59.428
I've already got a beach house. Two wives.

01:33:59.528 --> 01:34:03.941
All three are very expensive
and highly overrated.

01:34:04.464 --> 01:34:06.599
Besides, I don't think
you're in a position to negotiate.

01:34:06.699 --> 01:34:11.539
It's over, Robert, I called it in.
They know who you are.

01:34:11.639 --> 01:34:15.890
No, it's not over, Chase.
I'm just getting started.

01:34:21.115 --> 01:34:23.398
Any time, Jacob!

01:34:56.984 --> 01:34:58.746
Jacob!

01:35:39.358 --> 01:35:41.576
You know what, Jacob?

01:35:42.561 --> 01:35:45.767
There're only two kinds of men
in this organization...

01:35:46.966 --> 01:35:49.421
bad men who know they're bad...

01:35:52.905 --> 01:35:55.775
and bad men who think they're good.

01:35:55.875 --> 01:35:57.958
Pull the trigger!

01:36:00.213 --> 01:36:02.015
Prove I'm right!

01:36:02.115 --> 01:36:06.735
No, Agent Daniels, you get to survive.
Not because I can't kill you.

01:36:07.821 --> 01:36:11.641
I'd rather see you live,
knowing you chose the wrong side.

01:36:21.668 --> 01:36:24.361
I really wish you would've killed him.

01:36:39.318 --> 01:36:40.787
Thanks.

01:36:40.887 --> 01:36:44.539
Don't be too impressed, I was actually
aiming over your other shoulder.

01:36:49.162 --> 01:36:50.979
Let's go.

01:37:01.842 --> 01:37:04.727
I think that adrenaline's wearing off.

01:37:13.585 --> 01:37:16.623
Ange, it's me.

01:37:17.056 --> 01:37:20.393
Yeah. We're 15 minutes out.

01:37:20.493 --> 01:37:22.630
You gotta keep the engines running.

01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:25.067
Hey...

01:37:25.667 --> 01:37:27.683
you're going to make it, all right?

01:37:27.783 --> 01:37:30.704
We're going to get there. Just hold on.

01:37:37.343 --> 01:37:40.046
What the hell's with the get-up?
Are you taking us to a hospital or what?

01:37:40.146 --> 01:37:42.816
No. There's been an outbreak
all over the country.

01:37:42.916 --> 01:37:45.719
We've set up a temporary medical facility.
We're taking you there now.

01:37:45.819 --> 01:37:48.321
- What? When?
- Haven't you seen the news?

01:37:48.421 --> 01:37:50.656
No, I've been busy getting shot.

01:37:50.756 --> 01:37:53.526
- You're going good, we're almost there.
- Mr. Bradley, can you hear me?

01:37:53.626 --> 01:37:55.262
What's going on?

01:37:55.362 --> 01:37:59.487
I have to extract the cure
from his blood. Here, now.

01:37:59.667 --> 01:38:01.634
- So you need a sample.
- Not a sample.

01:38:01.734 --> 01:38:03.770
If I take eight ounces, I can save a city.

01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:06.541
If I take a quart,
I can save a small country.

01:38:06.641 --> 01:38:11.314
With all of it, maybe the northern
hemisphere, but seconds mean lives here.

01:38:11.414 --> 01:38:13.817
The more we talk, the more will die.

01:38:15.548 --> 01:38:18.700
All right. We do a transfusion.

01:38:20.721 --> 01:38:24.990
No! I'm sorry, but we can't dilute
the sample or we risk losing it.

01:38:25.090 --> 01:38:29.096
- We don't have options.
- Sample. You mean kill him?

01:38:30.096 --> 01:38:33.133
No. No, you did this!

01:38:33.233 --> 01:38:36.402
It's not his responsibility
to pay for your mistake!

01:38:36.502 --> 01:38:40.121
I did. But this is the only way.

01:38:42.408 --> 01:38:44.493
Do it then.

01:38:57.124 --> 01:38:59.458
Hey, Jacob, look,
you gotta listen to me, okay?

01:38:59.558 --> 01:39:02.177
You know you don't have to do this.

01:39:03.297 --> 01:39:05.164
It's fine.

01:39:06.164 --> 01:39:07.775
Do it.

01:39:08.599 --> 01:39:10.951
Have you ever donated blood?

01:39:11.304 --> 01:39:14.609
- Yeah.
- Good. It's just like that.

01:39:14.839 --> 01:39:17.409
Except that he won't wake up!

01:39:17.509 --> 01:39:20.079
Jacob, what...

01:39:20.179 --> 01:39:23.683
You know, that if you do this,
I mean, there's no way that...

01:39:24.383 --> 01:39:26.668
Right? You know that?

01:39:28.888 --> 01:39:31.926
What's the point of a second chance
if you don't use it?

01:39:41.166 --> 01:39:42.816
Do it.

01:39:45.471 --> 01:39:48.406
- No, no.
- Chase. Chase!

01:39:49.576 --> 01:39:51.226
Chase!

01:39:51.842 --> 01:39:53.662
Let him go.

01:39:54.814 --> 01:39:56.880
I said I would get you out.

01:39:59.384 --> 01:40:01.436
And you did.

01:40:02.288 --> 01:40:04.477
You got me out.

01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:09.595
But I need to do this.

01:40:10.445 --> 01:40:12.336
It's okay.

01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:16.168
Let him go.

01:40:20.373 --> 01:40:22.324
Let him go.

01:40:33.386 --> 01:40:36.227
Give him a painkiller.
Whatever you've got.

01:40:37.123 --> 01:40:40.209
No. No needles.

01:40:40.992 --> 01:40:43.224
I can't stand needles.

01:41:09.589 --> 01:41:12.947
Jacob, I need you
to count back from 10 for me.

01:41:23.703 --> 01:41:25.285
Ten.

01:41:27.741 --> 01:41:29.249
Nine.

01:41:35.147 --> 01:41:36.706
Eight.

01:41:39.253 --> 01:41:41.021
Seven.

01:41:42.621 --> 01:41:44.172
Six.

01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:48.012
Five.

01:42:24.948 --> 01:42:28.250
Please. Please, don't shoot.

01:42:28.750 --> 01:42:30.357
Wait.

01:42:30.932 --> 01:42:32.898
Please, don't hurt me.

01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:38.007
I was told there was a cure.
Please, you need to help me.

01:42:40.962 --> 01:42:43.161
I just need some help.
