00:03.602 --> 00:06.037
(Cell phone ringing)

00:06.071 --> 00:08.506
(Ring)

00:08.540 --> 00:09.907
(Ring, beep)

00:09.942 --> 00:12.510
- Jenny?
- Kate. Oh, thank God.

00:12.544 --> 00:14.711
Um, h... have you heard from Kevin?

00:14.746 --> 00:17.148
No, I haven't. Have you?

00:17.182 --> 00:19.583
No, I've been calling him
to test our system

00:19.618 --> 00:21.152
and he's not answering,

00:21.186 --> 00:24.021
and I'm freaking out a little bit.

00:24.055 --> 00:26.223
Um, do you have any idea where he is?

00:28.526 --> 00:31.094
Kate? Kate, are you there?

00:31.129 --> 00:33.263
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

00:33.297 --> 00:36.499
What's going on? Where's Kevin?

00:36.534 --> 00:39.369
Jenny, I need you to stay calm, okay?

00:39.403 --> 00:41.905
Something's happened.

00:48.412 --> 00:51.814
Crime scene <i>at</i> a fire?
Never done one of these before.

00:51.848 --> 00:53.449
After this, you might not want to.

00:53.484 --> 00:54.605
Building was being rehabbed,

00:54.618 --> 00:56.219
so the place was supposed to be empty.

00:56.253 --> 00:57.920
I guess our victim didn't get that memo.

00:57.954 --> 00:59.589
Do we know who our victim is?

00:59.623 --> 01:01.456
Uh, no...
(Cell phone ringing)

01:01.491 --> 01:03.625
Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God.
Oh, my God. It's Jenny.

01:03.660 --> 01:04.894
It's go time. Hi, Jenny.

01:04.928 --> 01:07.229
Are you having contractions? Are you...

01:07.263 --> 01:08.564
Oh.

01:08.598 --> 01:11.266
No. No, it's good to double-check

01:11.301 --> 01:13.703
if my phone's working... or triple-check.

01:13.737 --> 01:16.105
Okay, all right, sweetie. Talk to you soon.
(Laughs)

01:16.139 --> 01:17.472
(Beep)
False alarm.

01:17.507 --> 01:20.609
- What is she, uh, two days past her due
date? - Three.

01:20.643 --> 01:22.711
So, it could happen at any minute.

01:22.745 --> 01:24.713
Can you believe it? Me as a dad.

01:24.747 --> 01:26.748
No, Ryan, you're gonna be great.
(Sighs)

01:26.782 --> 01:27.816
You guys pick a name?

01:27.850 --> 01:29.017
No, we couldn't agree on one.

01:29.051 --> 01:30.485
So we're waiting to see
if it's a boy or a girl,

01:30.520 --> 01:31.587
and then decide.

01:31.621 --> 01:34.622
May I suggest...
(Whispers) "Cosmo"?

01:34.656 --> 01:35.890
No, you may not.

01:35.925 --> 01:37.158
And rather than pick a name for my kid,

01:37.193 --> 01:38.426
you should pick a date for your wedding.

01:38.460 --> 01:39.500
Pick a date for my wedding?

01:39.528 --> 01:40.661
I was planning on bringing her.

01:40.696 --> 01:43.364
Really? When is that?
I might have plans.

01:44.934 --> 01:46.601
Oh.

01:46.635 --> 01:48.870
(Indistinct radio chatter)

01:48.904 --> 01:49.970
(Man) Hey.

01:50.004 --> 01:51.439
I'm Mark Kimball, building and safety.

01:51.473 --> 01:52.906
Do you guys really need to be in here?

01:52.941 --> 01:54.475
It's where our crime scene is.

01:54.509 --> 01:56.910
Ah. Well, don't stay
any longer than you have to.

01:56.945 --> 01:59.247
Fire did structural damage.
I need to clear the building.

01:59.281 --> 02:00.681
We should be in and out.

02:00.716 --> 02:02.516
- Okay.
- Thanks.

02:02.551 --> 02:04.652
(Radio chatter)

02:04.686 --> 02:06.319
(Camera shutter clicking)

02:06.354 --> 02:08.354
So, do we know who the victim is?

02:08.389 --> 02:13.326
Nope. Dude had a wallet.
It's burned to a crisp.

02:13.361 --> 02:15.162
Even if he was a dude.
It's even hard to tell that.

02:15.196 --> 02:16.296
I see what you mean.

02:16.330 --> 02:18.598
Actually, he <i>is</i> a dude,

02:18.633 --> 02:21.534
which is about all
I could tell you right now.

02:21.569 --> 02:23.737
- Is that a bullet hole?
- Probably a nine.

02:23.771 --> 02:26.573
So needless to say,
this wasn't from natural causes.

02:26.607 --> 02:28.308
(Woman) Neither was the fire.

02:28.342 --> 02:30.644
This is lieutenant Delia Burton.

02:30.678 --> 02:32.011
She's a fire investigator with F.D.N.Y.

02:32.045 --> 02:33.112
Detective Beckett. Mr. Castle.

02:33.147 --> 02:34.147
(Beckett) Nice to meet you.

02:34.181 --> 02:35.749
So this was arson?

02:35.783 --> 02:37.350
Well, it's looking that way.

02:37.385 --> 02:40.119
I found miniscule traces
of accelerant at the flashpoint.

02:40.154 --> 02:42.488
So the killer set the fire
to cover up the murder?

02:42.522 --> 02:44.690
Except there's no accelerant
on the body.

02:44.724 --> 02:47.059
And the fire's flashpoint
is deeper in the building.

02:47.094 --> 02:49.095
You know, normally,
when you're disposing of a body,

02:49.129 --> 02:50.369
you're gonna make sure it burns.

02:50.397 --> 02:52.398
So maybe our victim
surprised the arsonist...

02:52.432 --> 02:55.067
And the arsonist killed him,
silencing him as a witness?

02:55.102 --> 02:56.368
That's how it looks to me.

02:56.403 --> 02:59.405
Then again, homicide's not my specialty.

02:59.439 --> 03:01.707
No, uh, but fire is.

03:01.741 --> 03:03.642
Would you mind keeping me in the loop

03:03.677 --> 03:05.243
in case you find anything else?

03:05.278 --> 03:06.812
Sure.

03:06.846 --> 03:08.747
As soon as I know
what happened, so will you.

03:08.782 --> 03:10.849
(Building creaks)

03:10.883 --> 03:13.018
- Oh, what was that?
- The building.

03:13.052 --> 03:14.719
You guys should probably go.

03:14.753 --> 03:15.987
Sounds good.

03:16.022 --> 03:17.823
See ya.

03:17.857 --> 03:20.525
(Sighs)

03:20.559 --> 03:22.493
I'm... marrying him.

03:22.528 --> 03:23.829
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

03:23.863 --> 03:25.997
Uh, why don't we just look
into whoever owns this place?

03:26.032 --> 03:27.199
See if they know
who would've been in here.

03:27.233 --> 03:28.599
Right.

03:28.634 --> 03:31.135
I have no idea who he is.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.570
Wasn't nobody supposed to be in there

03:32.604 --> 03:34.271
- on account of the renovation.
- Mm-hmm.

03:34.306 --> 03:37.308
Maybe the guy was a bum
or a squatter or something.

03:38.744 --> 03:39.844
But, hey, you know.

03:39.878 --> 03:41.412
Human life, still a tragedy, right?

03:41.447 --> 03:43.781
Mr. Turino, let's talk about
why no one was there.

03:43.816 --> 03:45.015
Not even a security guard.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.951
Wasn't your building basically abandoned

03:46.985 --> 03:49.320
after you stopped
renovations three months ago?

03:49.354 --> 03:51.388
Due to a cash flow problem?

03:51.422 --> 03:52.589
Who are you again?

03:52.623 --> 03:54.124
Just someone who couldn't
help but notice

03:54.159 --> 03:57.127
your bank required high levels
of insurance on that building

03:57.162 --> 03:58.395
as a condition of granting you the loan.

03:58.429 --> 03:59.629
So?

03:59.664 --> 04:01.398
So a total-loss insurance claim

04:01.432 --> 04:03.667
would solve all
of your cash flow problems.

04:03.701 --> 04:07.103
Right. The downside being,
you'll go to prison for murder.

04:07.137 --> 04:08.304
Are you kidding me?

04:08.339 --> 04:10.640
I wouldn't burn down my own building.

04:10.675 --> 04:12.776
Okay, somebody else must've done it.

04:12.810 --> 04:14.478
Tell me, Mr. Turino,

04:14.512 --> 04:17.213
are you involved in organized crime?

04:17.248 --> 04:19.781
I take offense to that.

04:19.815 --> 04:21.450
Just because I'm Italian,
I'm in the mob?

04:21.485 --> 04:23.719
No, I think you are in the mob
because you're a known member

04:23.754 --> 04:26.890
of the Maneri crime family,
and you also have convictions

04:26.924 --> 04:30.393
in racketeering, fraud, assault...

04:30.427 --> 04:32.728
Yeah, okay. Okay. I moved on.

04:32.763 --> 04:34.463
I'm out of the life now.

04:34.498 --> 04:37.132
It was my dream to rehab that building

04:37.166 --> 04:40.436
and flip it, retire to Boca.

04:40.470 --> 04:44.106
Now that dream? It's up in smoke.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.074

05:07.696 --> 05:09.297
(Click)

05:26.014 --> 05:27.548
- Yo, Beckett.
- Yeah?

05:27.582 --> 05:29.683
So Art Turino's alibi checks out.

05:29.717 --> 05:32.486
He was at the Pink Palace
Gentleman's Club last night

05:32.520 --> 05:34.455
stuffing G-strings
from 8:00 P.M. to 4:00 A.M.

05:34.489 --> 05:35.889
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
he's in the clear.

05:35.924 --> 05:37.358
I mean, Turino wouldn't do this himself.

05:37.392 --> 05:39.093
Well, I'll see if anyone
he's been hanging with

05:39.127 --> 05:40.127
has any connection to arson.

05:40.162 --> 05:41.328
Okay, I'll grab Castle.

05:41.362 --> 05:43.330
We'll see if Lanie's
got anything new on our vic.

05:43.364 --> 05:48.234
Still no I.D., and he's not
in any missing person's report.

05:48.269 --> 05:49.670
We get a match on the bullet?

05:49.704 --> 05:50.771
It's not in the system,

05:50.805 --> 05:52.305
but the cause of death was definitely

05:52.340 --> 05:53.974
a G.S.W. to the head.

05:54.008 --> 05:55.342
No smoke in the lungs,

05:55.376 --> 05:57.310
so he was already dead
before the fire got going.

05:57.345 --> 05:59.112
Whoa. Beats getting roasted alive.

05:59.146 --> 06:01.214
I'm right there with you.

06:01.248 --> 06:03.350
Also, he was healthy, muscular.

06:03.384 --> 06:07.087
His teeth were in good shape.
So he probably wasn't homeless.

06:07.121 --> 06:09.055
Plus he had great medical care.

06:09.090 --> 06:10.690
How can you tell?

06:10.724 --> 06:12.658
He had a fractured leg
that was splinted...

06:12.693 --> 06:15.595
(Paper rustles)
with metal plates and screws.

06:15.629 --> 06:17.697
- Quality work, too.
- Can the plate be traced?

06:17.731 --> 06:18.865
I'm already on it.

06:18.899 --> 06:22.034
(Delia) Was it the left leg?

06:22.068 --> 06:25.404
Anterior femur, mid-way down?

06:25.438 --> 06:27.573
That's right. How did you know?

06:27.608 --> 06:30.942
I know who he is.

06:30.977 --> 06:34.013
He's a fire investigator
named Blake McCann.

06:34.047 --> 06:37.916
He was my partner.

06:40.191 --> 06:44.191

Sync and corrections by atrn97g

06:47.251 --> 06:49.819
Okay. Got it, Lanie.

06:50.518 --> 06:51.901
(Beep)

06:53.128 --> 06:58.098
So dental records confirm
that our victim is Blake McCann.

06:58.133 --> 07:00.867
(Chair scrapes floor)

07:00.901 --> 07:02.536
I'm very sorry.

07:02.570 --> 07:04.204
He was a good man.

07:04.238 --> 07:07.106
Most decent person I ever knew.

07:07.141 --> 07:08.808
Do you know of anyone in his life

07:08.842 --> 07:10.577
that would've wanted to hurt him?

07:12.846 --> 07:15.682
Just the person who left this.

07:15.716 --> 07:18.851
I found it at the fire scene.

07:18.886 --> 07:20.319
What is it?

07:20.353 --> 07:23.322
This pattern is made by accelerant.

07:23.356 --> 07:26.225
From the staining pattern,
probably benzoyl peroxide,

07:26.259 --> 07:27.794
squeezed from a tube.

07:27.828 --> 07:30.629
Blake found the same pattern
in ten other burned buildings.

07:30.664 --> 07:31.864
So it's a signature?

07:31.899 --> 07:33.199
Of a serial arsonist.

07:33.233 --> 07:35.668
Blake has been hunting
this guy for years.

07:35.702 --> 07:37.803
It's how he spent every spare minute.

07:37.837 --> 07:40.339
In fact, he had just
taken some vacation days

07:40.373 --> 07:41.373
to work the case.

07:41.408 --> 07:44.976
When I found the symbol, I called him.

07:45.011 --> 07:47.213
He didn't call me back. I, uh...

07:50.116 --> 07:52.383
I just had an awful feeling.

07:52.418 --> 07:53.919
Did he know who the arsonist is?

07:53.953 --> 07:55.553
Did he have any suspects?

07:55.588 --> 07:57.189
Not that he ever told me.

07:57.223 --> 07:58.389
He just called him "The Phantom,"

07:58.424 --> 07:59.958
because he seemed to be able
to slip in and out

07:59.992 --> 08:01.392
of buildings
without people ever noticing.

08:01.427 --> 08:03.195
Until now, maybe.

08:03.229 --> 08:04.863
Well, that's gotta be it, right?

08:04.897 --> 08:06.631
I mean, Blake went in that building

08:06.665 --> 08:07.998
because he was after the guy.

08:08.033 --> 08:09.234
And that's who killed him.

08:09.268 --> 08:11.436
It's too soon to know,
but it's a place to start.

08:11.470 --> 08:14.171
Now, we're gonna need copies
of his case files

08:14.206 --> 08:15.540
linked to the arsonist.

08:15.574 --> 08:17.294
Well, he took a bunch of them
home with him.

08:17.309 --> 08:18.776
I'll have detectives pick them up.

08:18.810 --> 08:21.178
The rest are at the office.
I'll get them over to you.

08:21.213 --> 08:22.413
Great.

08:22.448 --> 08:23.781
(Magnet clicks)

08:23.815 --> 08:27.517
So, I talked to Blake McCann's
co-workers, his ex-wife,

08:27.552 --> 08:30.554
and if he's got any enemies,
I am not finding them.

08:30.588 --> 08:32.422
Leaving us with The Phantom.

08:32.457 --> 08:33.957
Can you please not call him that?

08:33.991 --> 08:35.292
It just... it sounds silly.

08:35.326 --> 08:37.594
Sillier than the "arsonist"?
Which starts with "arse"?

08:37.629 --> 08:39.962
At least with "The Phantom"
he's got some mystique.

08:39.996 --> 08:42.232
He doesn't deserve mystique.
He's a murderer.

08:42.267 --> 08:44.701
Yeah, but killing is not
a part of his usual M.O.

08:44.736 --> 08:47.237
Until now, all the buildings
he torched were empty.

08:47.272 --> 08:49.539
Okay. All right, so what else
do they have in common?

08:49.574 --> 08:51.308
Not much. All the buildings were older,

08:51.342 --> 08:53.577
but some were residential,
some were office buildings.

08:53.611 --> 08:55.345
There were two in Manhattan
and the rest in Brooklyn

08:55.380 --> 08:56.545
and in Queens.

08:56.580 --> 08:57.713
Were they insured?

08:57.748 --> 08:58.982
A couple of them, but not all of them.

08:59.016 --> 09:01.217
So it probably was not arson-for-hire.

09:01.252 --> 09:03.719
Which means he's doing this for himself.

09:03.754 --> 09:06.990
He's burning these buildings
to satisfy an inner need.

09:07.024 --> 09:08.958
And like a serial killer,
there's a reason

09:08.993 --> 09:10.559
why he chooses the buildings he does.

09:10.594 --> 09:12.895
There's a pattern or something.

09:12.929 --> 09:14.263
- Ooh!
- What?

09:14.298 --> 09:15.898
Entry from three days ago.
McCann wrote down a name.

09:15.932 --> 09:17.032
Adam Ferguson.

09:28.178 --> 09:30.345
(Esposito) - Clear.
(Ryan) - Clear.

09:30.379 --> 09:34.283
I'd say someone besides us
is interested in Blake McCann.

09:34.317 --> 09:37.752
Yeah, looks like this place
was tossed after he was killed.

09:37.787 --> 09:39.188
You thinking what I'm thinking?

09:39.222 --> 09:40.522
That the arsonist shot him

09:40.556 --> 09:42.324
and then got word
McCann left a paper trail.

09:42.358 --> 09:44.526
He came here searching
for any files or evidence

09:44.560 --> 09:46.160
that would point to him.

09:46.195 --> 09:48.963
Maybe our prep tossed the place
because he couldn't find them.

09:48.997 --> 09:50.998
But McCann had no reason
to hide those files.

09:51.033 --> 09:53.167
They'd be out on a table,
a desk or a nightstand.

09:53.202 --> 09:55.036
Wait.

09:55.070 --> 09:58.306
McCann's car. It wasn't in the driveway.

09:58.341 --> 09:59.341
Or in the garage.

09:59.375 --> 10:00.608
He probably drove it to that building

10:00.643 --> 10:02.276
before he was killed.
It could still be down there.

10:02.311 --> 10:03.978
Yeah, with those files in it.

10:04.012 --> 10:04.979
(Typing, computer beeps)

10:05.013 --> 10:06.513
Here it is. Adam Ferguson.

10:06.548 --> 10:08.482
And Blake McCann helped put him away

10:08.516 --> 10:09.884
on multiple arson counts.

10:09.918 --> 10:11.853
He got out of prison five years ago.

10:11.887 --> 10:13.821
Which, by wild coincidence,
is right about the same time

10:13.856 --> 10:15.323
those buildings started getting torched.

10:15.357 --> 10:17.158
Not only that, but check this out.
(Paper rustles)

10:17.192 --> 10:19.059
Look at who Blake called on his cell

10:19.093 --> 10:20.594
the day before he was killed.

10:22.430 --> 10:25.866
Yeah, Blake McCann called me.

10:25.900 --> 10:27.901
To talk about what?

10:27.935 --> 10:30.303
Just a chat between friends.

10:30.338 --> 10:31.405
Where were you last night

10:31.439 --> 10:34.007
between 9:00 and 1:00 A.M.,
Mr. Ferguson?

10:34.041 --> 10:35.342
Why?

10:35.376 --> 10:38.245
Because he was murdered
by an arsonist he was hunting.

10:38.279 --> 10:40.580
Well, that's a real shame.

10:40.614 --> 10:42.983
An arsonist not unlike yourself.

10:43.017 --> 10:45.651
Matter of fact, one of his final acts

10:45.686 --> 10:47.520
was to write down your name.

10:47.554 --> 10:49.256
Not because I killed him.

10:49.290 --> 10:53.192
It must've been The Phantom.
I don't know his real name.

10:53.226 --> 10:54.960
How do you know about him at all?

10:54.995 --> 10:56.496
Blake told me.

10:56.530 --> 10:57.764
He called me.

10:57.798 --> 11:01.100
Asked me to meet him
in some deli in the Village.

11:01.134 --> 11:04.103
He was all stalled out
about catching this Phantom guy.

11:04.137 --> 11:06.906
He asked for my help,
and I said I'd give it to him.

11:06.940 --> 11:09.008
Even though he put you in prison?

11:09.042 --> 11:12.744
Blake paid me for my time.

11:12.779 --> 11:19.084
Plus, uh, he let me see
some photos of the fires.

11:19.119 --> 11:23.022
(Chuckles)
So we both got something out of the deal.

11:23.056 --> 11:26.224
And what other wisdom did you offer him?

11:26.258 --> 11:30.896
Any idiot can slosh gas around
and light a match.

11:30.930 --> 11:33.799
But this guy? He knew fire,

11:33.833 --> 11:35.734
knew how it spread.

11:35.768 --> 11:39.370
See, buildings are just like people.

11:39.405 --> 11:45.276
There's a weak spot, a soft underbelly.

11:45.311 --> 11:51.449
He would find it, use it,
unleash an inferno

11:51.483 --> 11:53.851
with barely any accelerant.

11:53.885 --> 11:55.987
That...

11:56.021 --> 11:59.757
is an artist.

11:59.791 --> 12:02.526
So how did any of this help McCann?

12:02.561 --> 12:04.161
I gave him some tips.

12:04.195 --> 12:07.064
I told him he was looking for someone

12:07.098 --> 12:09.533
who cases buildings carefully.

12:09.568 --> 12:12.736
Visits them a few times
before he strikes.

12:12.771 --> 12:15.238
What else?

12:15.273 --> 12:19.542
An artist like The Phantom?
He wants to admire his work.

12:19.577 --> 12:23.513
It's not enough that he sets the fire.

12:23.547 --> 12:25.815
He needs to feel the heat.

12:25.850 --> 12:30.454
To listen to the music.

12:30.488 --> 12:34.223
The roar of the flames,
the moans of the buildings

12:34.257 --> 12:39.328
as they give in...
that's what he lives for.

12:39.363 --> 12:43.032
Which is why with every fire he sets,

12:43.066 --> 12:45.167
he is there watching.

12:49.572 --> 12:51.107
(Gates) What do you make of his story?

12:51.141 --> 12:53.742
The staff at the deli
where he said he met with McCann

12:53.776 --> 12:55.144
remembers seeing them.

12:55.178 --> 12:57.713
There's no way to really
know what they talked about.

12:57.747 --> 12:59.281
McCann could've accused
him of being The Phantom.

12:59.316 --> 13:00.616
Maybe he <i>is</i> The Phantom.

13:00.650 --> 13:02.718
We don't have anything that links him

13:02.752 --> 13:04.486
to any of the arsons yet, so...

13:04.521 --> 13:06.421
Dig into his alibi and associates.

13:06.455 --> 13:08.724
See if you can find anything
that's solid.

13:08.758 --> 13:09.825
Okay.

13:09.859 --> 13:11.827
(Footsteps depart)

13:11.861 --> 13:12.995
You know, one thing about his story

13:13.029 --> 13:15.130
that does ring true...
on a character level...

13:15.164 --> 13:18.133
is about how the arsonist
watches his own fires.

13:18.167 --> 13:20.168
Yeah, well, I've got UNIs
canvassing the fire scene

13:20.202 --> 13:21.802
and checking into
all the security cameras

13:21.837 --> 13:23.738
in the area for anyone
that was hanging out.

13:23.772 --> 13:25.473
(Cell phone ringing)

13:25.508 --> 13:27.175
(Beep)
Beckett.

13:27.209 --> 13:28.943
Yo, found McCann's car.

13:28.977 --> 13:30.645
It was parked two blocks from the fire,

13:30.679 --> 13:31.746
and there was something inside.

13:31.780 --> 13:32.914
Arson files?

13:32.948 --> 13:34.188
No, looks like a couple of files

13:34.216 --> 13:35.383
that he put together himself.

13:35.418 --> 13:36.884
One's about the building
that he was burned up in.

13:36.919 --> 13:38.052
What's the other one?

13:39.287 --> 13:42.322
Give me that.

13:42.357 --> 13:45.325
It's an old shoe factory
in Brooklyn on Arcadia Lane.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.227
Looks like it's been empty
for five years.

13:47.262 --> 13:49.296
(Lowered voice) You know, maybe those
files were on buildings

13:49.330 --> 13:51.632
that McCann thought were being targeted.

13:51.667 --> 13:53.100
He was right about one of them.

13:53.134 --> 13:55.669
Listen, Espo, we believe
that the arsonist

13:55.703 --> 13:57.571
cases the buildings he burns.

13:57.605 --> 13:59.206
So check that factory, and see if anyone

13:59.240 --> 14:00.707
suspicious has been seen inside.

14:00.741 --> 14:02.209
We're on it.

14:02.243 --> 14:03.410
(Beeps)

14:16.557 --> 14:18.424
(Door creaks)

14:20.761 --> 14:23.763
Man, look at this place.

14:23.798 --> 14:25.164
Fire would be an improvement.

14:25.199 --> 14:26.899
Yeah.

14:31.472 --> 14:33.939
Looks like no one's
set foot in here in years.

14:33.974 --> 14:37.743
It's pretty creepy.

14:37.777 --> 14:40.179
Hey! Look.

14:40.214 --> 14:42.047
Trust me, bro, your ringer
is all the way up.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.181
Just wanted to make sure.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.183
Jenny might call me at any minute.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.385
Pulling your phone out
isn't gonna make it happen

14:47.420 --> 14:48.520
any sooner.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.055
You just need to chill.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.725
And... <i>you</i> know this
from your vast experience

14:52.759 --> 14:54.727
of having zero kids?

14:54.761 --> 14:57.663
All right, you know what?
You're all emotional right now.

14:57.697 --> 15:01.099
- So I'm gonna let that go.
- Hmm.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.801
(Sighs)
All right. Let's get back.

15:03.836 --> 15:05.637
There's nothing to see here.

15:05.671 --> 15:06.838
Oh, wait a minute.

15:06.872 --> 15:10.208
Abandoned building
with a brand-new lock?

15:13.246 --> 15:14.246
(Cocks gun)

15:16.882 --> 15:20.351
(Clanging)

15:20.385 --> 15:21.686
(Chain clatters)

15:21.720 --> 15:25.690
(Door rattling)

15:25.724 --> 15:28.660
N.Y.P.D.! Anybody here?!

15:37.902 --> 15:38.969
All clear.

15:39.003 --> 15:41.438
Clear.

15:41.473 --> 15:42.806
What the hell?

15:42.840 --> 15:45.976
Javi, these are blasting caps here.

15:46.010 --> 15:47.545
And accelerants up the wazoo.

15:47.579 --> 15:49.612
Look.
(Whistles)

15:49.647 --> 15:53.449
This isn't the arsonist's
next target. It's his workshop.

15:53.484 --> 15:57.988
(Alarm blaring and beeping)

15:58.022 --> 16:00.456
We must've set off an alarm.

16:00.491 --> 16:02.492
It's not an alarm!

16:02.526 --> 16:03.960
Get out. Get out now!

16:06.330 --> 16:08.298
(Explosion)

16:12.169 --> 16:16.439
(Glass shatters, car alarms blaring)

16:19.573 --> 16:22.175
So I checked the security
cameras near the fire.

16:22.209 --> 16:23.977
They were disabled.

16:24.012 --> 16:25.145
Disabled how?

16:25.179 --> 16:26.546
Someone used a can of spray paint,

16:26.580 --> 16:28.314
mounted it on a pole,
and blacked out the lenses

16:28.349 --> 16:30.783
of both cameras
just minutes before the fire.

16:30.817 --> 16:32.452
Well, that must've been the arsonist.

16:32.486 --> 16:33.719
Maybe somebody saw them do it.

16:33.754 --> 16:35.855
Can we canvass the area?
And by "we," I mean,

16:35.889 --> 16:36.956
obviously, somebody else.

16:36.990 --> 16:38.958
What are you looking for?

16:38.992 --> 16:40.293
And don't tell me.

16:40.327 --> 16:42.728
It's something completely
inappropriate for the workplace.

16:42.763 --> 16:43.963
No, not this time.

16:43.997 --> 16:45.197
Uh, given that everyone

16:45.231 --> 16:46.598
uploads everything
to the Internet nowadays,

16:46.633 --> 16:48.134
I thought I might see

16:48.168 --> 16:49.835
if anyone else out there took
a video of that fire, and look.

16:49.870 --> 16:52.404
(Beeps)

16:52.438 --> 16:55.141
If the arsonist was watching that fire,

16:55.175 --> 16:57.442
he might be in this video.

16:57.477 --> 17:00.212
- Can you turn up the sound?
- Yeah.

17:03.550 --> 17:05.517
<i>(Breathing heavily)</i>

17:05.551 --> 17:07.252
That doesn't look right.

17:07.287 --> 17:08.487
Seriously?

17:08.521 --> 17:09.820
A lot better quality
than a security camera.

17:09.855 --> 17:11.723
No, babe, I'm talking
about the building.

17:11.757 --> 17:12.957
That fire just started.

17:14.627 --> 17:16.094
Huh.

17:16.127 --> 17:17.194
"Huh," what?

17:17.229 --> 17:18.550
Fire department's not even there.

17:18.564 --> 17:19.731
I mean, they're not on their way.

17:19.765 --> 17:21.432
You can't hear the sirens.

17:21.465 --> 17:23.101
So how did the cameraman
know there was a fire

17:23.135 --> 17:24.202
when nobody else did?

17:24.236 --> 17:26.104
And listen to that.

17:26.137 --> 17:28.506
He's not yelling for anyone
to call 9-1-1.

17:28.540 --> 17:30.641
He's not saying anything.

17:31.777 --> 17:33.477
<i>(Breathing heavily)</i>

17:33.512 --> 17:36.113
Look at the camera work...
very smooth, steady.

17:36.147 --> 17:37.648
- You... you don't think...
- Yeah. I do.

17:37.683 --> 17:39.149
This isn't just footage of the fire.

17:39.184 --> 17:40.551
It was shot by the arsonist.

17:40.586 --> 17:43.221
We have to track down
whoever posted that video.

17:43.255 --> 17:46.691
Got you.

17:46.725 --> 17:48.125
That won't be so easy.
(Typing)

17:48.159 --> 17:50.928
Usually there's a file
embedded in the video

17:50.962 --> 17:54.064
with data on the camera,
but it's been stripped out.

17:54.099 --> 17:55.799
Can you tell where it
was first uploaded?

17:55.834 --> 17:57.300
Let me see.

17:57.335 --> 17:58.535
(Beeping)

17:58.569 --> 18:00.470
Looks like the video got bounced
around the net

18:00.504 --> 18:01.739
from site to site,

18:01.773 --> 18:03.340
but this is where it started.

18:03.374 --> 18:08.411
<i>(Flames whooshing)</i>

18:08.446 --> 18:10.547
Pyrolicious.com. Really?

18:10.581 --> 18:12.115
Wow. Okay.

18:12.149 --> 18:14.351
A site that caters to fire fetishists.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.486
I didn't even know
there was a fire fetish.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.020
The actual term is "pyrophilia."

18:18.055 --> 18:19.489
Further proof that the Internet

18:19.523 --> 18:20.823
has something for everyone.

18:20.858 --> 18:23.159
(Whispers)
I'm not gonna ask how you knew that.

18:24.394 --> 18:27.363
(Normal voice)
So when did this video show up there?

18:27.397 --> 18:29.832
(Typing)
About an hour after the fire was put out.

18:29.867 --> 18:31.200
And who runs this site?

18:31.235 --> 18:33.936
It's registered to a Milo Pavlik.

18:33.971 --> 18:35.271
Does he have a record?

18:35.305 --> 18:36.338
(Typing)

18:36.373 --> 18:39.575
Oh, yeah. He burnt down his family house

18:39.609 --> 18:40.942
when he was 19.

18:40.977 --> 18:44.012
Where do we find this Milo Pavlik?

18:45.582 --> 18:46.548
(Pounds on door)

18:46.583 --> 18:49.518
Milo Pavlik! N.Y.P.D., open up!

18:49.552 --> 18:51.420
What? Hi, hey. What are you doing?

18:51.454 --> 18:52.721
Where did this video come from?

18:52.756 --> 18:54.856
Listen, nothing I do here is illegal.

18:54.891 --> 18:56.858
I... I simply provide fire
enthusiasts around the globe...

18:56.893 --> 18:58.626
This fire was set by an arsonist.
(Door closes)

18:58.661 --> 19:00.162
Not to mention a murderer.

19:00.196 --> 19:02.030
So who shot this video? Was it you?

19:02.064 --> 19:03.564
No. What? It w... it wasn't me.

19:03.599 --> 19:04.699
(Cell phone chimes)
Then how'd it get up on your site?

19:04.733 --> 19:05.901
Sorry, it's a text.

19:05.935 --> 19:07.435
I don't care. How did it
get up on your site?

19:07.469 --> 19:09.370
I have a drop-box outside.
People leave stuff.

19:09.405 --> 19:11.072
It was on a U.S.B. drive.

19:11.107 --> 19:13.274
It was quality material,
so I uploaded it.

19:13.309 --> 19:14.275
Who dropped it off?

19:14.310 --> 19:15.743
I don't know. I have no idea.

19:15.778 --> 19:17.412
That's very convenient.
Now, did this person

19:17.446 --> 19:18.726
ever provide any other material?

19:18.747 --> 19:20.047
Oh, yeah. H... he has a real eye, this one.

19:20.081 --> 19:22.617
Sent me a few choice items.
(Cell phone chimes)

19:22.651 --> 19:24.952
If it really was someone else
and they're submitting videos,

19:24.986 --> 19:27.288
then he visits the site.

19:27.323 --> 19:28.523
I'm gonna need the names
of all of your members

19:28.557 --> 19:29.878
along with records of site traffic

19:29.891 --> 19:31.292
over the past five years.

19:31.326 --> 19:33.560
Pretty sure you need a warrant for that.

19:33.594 --> 19:34.695
Not if you agree to cooperate...
(Chimes)

19:34.729 --> 19:36.297
which I highly encourage you to do.

19:36.331 --> 19:37.731
Hey, who the hell keeps texting you?

19:37.732 --> 19:39.166
It's a news alert.

19:39.201 --> 19:41.468
There's a 3-alarm fire
going in Brooklyn.

19:41.502 --> 19:42.903
Where in Brooklyn?

19:42.938 --> 19:45.172
Uh, some factory on Arcadia Lane.

19:45.207 --> 19:47.441
Oh, no.

19:53.715 --> 19:57.083
(Sirens wailing)

19:57.117 --> 19:58.985
(Tires screech)

20:00.822 --> 20:02.288
(Door closes)

20:02.323 --> 20:03.957
(Indistinct shouting)

20:22.401 --> 20:25.337
Still no answer.
Not from Ryan or Esposito.

20:25.371 --> 20:27.071
Detective. Are you sure they're inside?

20:27.106 --> 20:28.273
Yeah, they were checking the building

20:28.307 --> 20:30.074
in connection with an arson homicide,

20:30.109 --> 20:31.375
and they haven't called in yet.

20:31.409 --> 20:33.111
You need to alert your rescue teams.

20:33.145 --> 20:34.478
Detective, the building's
fully involved.

20:34.513 --> 20:36.648
I just had to pull out
the interior attack teams.

20:36.682 --> 20:37.849
I can't send in a rescue company

20:37.883 --> 20:39.083
until it's more contained.

20:39.118 --> 20:40.818
Wait, more contained?

20:40.853 --> 20:43.187
If my guys are in there,
I need you to bring them out.

20:43.221 --> 20:44.922
If we could get in there, I would.

20:44.957 --> 20:46.423
But there's been
a partial collapse inside.

20:46.458 --> 20:48.359
I almost lost six of my guys.

20:48.393 --> 20:50.027
We'll do everything we can, detective,

20:50.061 --> 20:51.928
but this building's
a firestorm. Every floor.

20:51.963 --> 20:53.564
If your guys are in there, I'm sorry.

20:53.598 --> 20:54.931
They're probably already gone.

20:56.701 --> 20:59.136
Chief?

20:59.171 --> 21:00.337
Fire.

21:00.372 --> 21:01.472
What started it?

21:01.506 --> 21:02.673
Shattered windows and structural damage

21:02.707 --> 21:05.608
indicate some kind of explosion.

21:09.280 --> 21:11.948
Maybe, um...

21:11.983 --> 21:13.216
maybe they weren't inside.

21:13.250 --> 21:14.450
Their car's here
and they haven't called.

21:14.485 --> 21:15.819
They're inside.

21:15.853 --> 21:17.954
I shouldn't have let them
go in. Not alone. I should've...

21:17.989 --> 21:19.855
There's no way you could've known that.
(Cell phone ringing)

21:19.890 --> 21:20.890
This isn't you.

21:20.924 --> 21:24.194
It's the arsonist.
(Ring)

21:24.228 --> 21:25.728
It's Jenny.

21:25.762 --> 21:27.202
(Ring)
Why would she be calling you?

21:27.231 --> 21:28.698
Maybe she's heard from them.

21:28.732 --> 21:31.067
Maybe she knows that they're safe.

21:31.101 --> 21:33.403
(Ring, beep) Jenny?

21:33.437 --> 21:34.970
Kate.
(Exhales) Oh, thank God.

21:35.005 --> 21:37.073
Um, h... have you heard from Kevin?

21:37.107 --> 21:39.474
No, I haven't. Have you?

21:39.509 --> 21:42.311
No. I've been calling him
to test our system,

21:42.345 --> 21:43.779
and he's not answering.

21:43.814 --> 21:46.348
And I'm... I'm freaking out
a little bit. Um...

21:46.382 --> 21:48.584
do you have any idea where he is?

21:50.854 --> 21:53.422
Kate? Kate, are you there?

21:53.456 --> 21:55.624
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

21:55.658 --> 21:58.827
What's going on? Where's Kevin?

21:58.861 --> 22:01.796
Jenny, I need you to stay calm, okay?

22:01.831 --> 22:04.099
Something's happened.

22:04.133 --> 22:05.567
<i>...And as firefighters struggle</i>

22:05.602 --> 22:07.202
<i>to bring the blaze under control,</i>

22:07.237 --> 22:10.739
<i>we now have unconfirmed reports</i>
<i>that two N.Y.P.D. detectives</i>

22:10.773 --> 22:12.841
<i>were inside the building</i>
<i>at the time of the explosion.</i>

22:12.875 --> 22:14.776
<i>We'll be bringing you live updates</i>

22:14.810 --> 22:15.877
<i>as the news comes in.</i>

22:15.911 --> 22:17.445
(Remote clicks)

22:17.479 --> 22:19.647
Sir, is it true?

22:19.681 --> 22:20.849
We don't know.

22:20.883 --> 22:22.283
What we do know is that

22:22.317 --> 22:24.819
detectives Ryan and Esposito
were investigating

22:24.854 --> 22:27.555
that building for ties
to a serial arsonist.

22:27.589 --> 22:30.057
And it's possible that
the explosion in that building

22:30.091 --> 22:33.461
was deliberately set
by that same arsonist...

22:33.495 --> 22:35.863
a man suspected in ten other fires,

22:35.897 --> 22:37.465
as well as the murder of a member

22:37.499 --> 22:38.999
of the New York Fire Department.

22:39.033 --> 22:41.001
And if it is true,

22:41.035 --> 22:43.355
then this sick son of a bitch
has just added two of our own

22:43.371 --> 22:44.772
to his list.

22:44.806 --> 22:48.142
On your desk, you will find
copies of all the files

22:48.176 --> 22:50.944
we have on each one of these arsons.

22:50.979 --> 22:53.046
Somewhere in there, there is a trail.

22:53.081 --> 22:55.215
Somewhere in there, there is a clue

22:55.250 --> 22:56.984
as to who he is.

22:57.018 --> 22:59.686
And he needs to be brought to account.

23:04.925 --> 23:08.295
(Building creaking)

23:08.329 --> 23:11.331
(Rumbling, objects crashing)

23:18.038 --> 23:21.941
(Flames crackling, rumbling continues)

23:24.611 --> 23:26.478
(Creaking continues)

23:26.513 --> 23:29.048
(Rumbling continues)

23:33.420 --> 23:34.920
Ryan!

23:37.924 --> 23:40.292
Ryan!

23:40.327 --> 23:41.360
(Coughing)

23:41.394 --> 23:44.763
Kevin! Kevin, is that you?

23:44.798 --> 23:47.132
(Coughing continues)

23:50.036 --> 23:51.269
You all right?

23:51.304 --> 23:52.403
Yeah, yeah.

23:52.438 --> 23:53.404
Aah, I can't move.

23:53.439 --> 23:56.341
My legs are stuck.

23:56.375 --> 23:59.044
(Panting)

24:02.114 --> 24:05.916
(Grunting)

24:05.951 --> 24:08.185
(Strained voice)
It's too heavy! Oh...

24:08.220 --> 24:10.521
It's an oven in here.
You should get out, man.

24:10.556 --> 24:11.789
Not without you, partner.

24:11.824 --> 24:13.324
(Rumbling and crashing)

24:13.359 --> 24:14.792
(Exhales) Last thing I remember
is the floor giving way.

24:14.827 --> 24:16.527
How far do you think we fell?

24:16.562 --> 24:18.062
At least two floors.

24:18.096 --> 24:21.765
Ah, must've rigged this place...
(Coughs)

24:21.799 --> 24:22.933
Probably to destroy any evidence

24:22.968 --> 24:23.968
in case it was found.

24:24.002 --> 24:25.369
Yeah, including us.

24:25.403 --> 24:27.571
Not if I can help it.
(Coughing)

24:27.605 --> 24:29.406
- You ready?
- Yeah.

24:29.440 --> 24:33.177
All right, here we go.
(Groaning)

24:33.211 --> 24:36.513
(Groaning continues)

24:38.449 --> 24:41.251
They're smart. They're survivors.

24:41.285 --> 24:43.620
If there's a safe place
inside that building,

24:43.654 --> 24:45.756
they may have found it.
They may still be alive.

24:45.790 --> 24:46.790
Yeah, but for how long?

24:46.824 --> 24:50.293
The two folders in McCann's car...

24:50.327 --> 24:54.563
he knew that this
building was next. How?

24:54.598 --> 24:55.698
Somehow, he must've figured out

24:55.732 --> 24:56.766
the arsonist's pattern.

24:56.800 --> 24:59.035
Which means there is a pattern.

24:59.069 --> 25:01.404
And if he figured it out, so can we.

25:01.438 --> 25:02.405
Move back!

25:02.439 --> 25:03.973
Everybody back!

25:04.008 --> 25:05.441
Move back!

25:05.475 --> 25:06.976
What's going on?

25:07.011 --> 25:08.144
This building's gone.

25:08.178 --> 25:09.279
We have to move to a defensive attack.

25:09.313 --> 25:10.979
The other structures are in danger.

25:11.014 --> 25:12.014
You're just giving up?

25:12.048 --> 25:13.348
No, our teams just went through

25:13.383 --> 25:15.017
the other buildings.
They're tinderboxes.

25:15.051 --> 25:17.292
If we don't hold the line,
we could lose the whole block.

25:19.523 --> 25:21.957
(Voice breaks) Kate.

25:24.461 --> 25:27.762
(Groaning)
(Grunts)

25:27.797 --> 25:29.064
That ceiling's gonna
give way at any minute.

25:29.098 --> 25:30.532
You need to get out of here, okay?

25:30.566 --> 25:31.533
Shut up.

25:31.567 --> 25:33.101
I'm trying to save your life.

25:33.136 --> 25:34.202
(Laughing)

25:34.237 --> 25:36.071
(Groans)

25:42.478 --> 25:45.146
(Object clangs)

25:45.180 --> 25:46.481
Here we go.

25:46.515 --> 25:47.649
There.

25:50.085 --> 25:52.720
(Groaning)

25:52.755 --> 25:55.490
(Grunts)

25:55.524 --> 25:56.691
(Panting)
Hold on.

25:56.725 --> 25:58.660
Yeah.

25:58.694 --> 26:01.095
- Ready?
- Yeah.

26:01.129 --> 26:04.131
(Groaning)
(Creaking)

26:04.166 --> 26:07.468
Aah! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

26:07.502 --> 26:08.735
(Panting)

26:08.770 --> 26:11.238
(Bar clatters)
I'm okay! I'm okay!

26:11.273 --> 26:15.009
- Can you walk?
- I don't know. Give me a hand. I'm okay.

26:15.043 --> 26:16.944
(Groans)
Come on.

26:16.978 --> 26:18.712
(Groaning)

26:18.746 --> 26:19.980
How's it feel?

26:20.014 --> 26:22.248
I can stand.

26:22.283 --> 26:23.350
Where are we?

26:23.384 --> 26:27.053
Looks like some kind of sub-basement.

26:27.088 --> 26:28.956
I don't see any doors.

26:28.990 --> 26:30.557
Look.

26:30.592 --> 26:32.960
Looks like that was our way out.

26:32.994 --> 26:35.695
Yeah, I don't think
we wanted to go up anyway.

26:35.729 --> 26:37.130
(Coughs)

26:37.164 --> 26:40.033
We're not gonna get out without help.

26:40.067 --> 26:42.535
(Exhales)
My phone's busted from the fall.

26:42.569 --> 26:44.304
How about you?

26:44.338 --> 26:47.540
Uh... yeah, I got nothing.

26:47.574 --> 26:51.577
All right, well, as big as this thing is,

26:51.612 --> 26:53.746
fire department's gotta be out there.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.080
They gotta be on scene.

26:55.115 --> 26:57.016
Yeah. We should let them know
that we're down here.

26:57.050 --> 26:58.317
Yeah.

26:58.351 --> 27:00.520
Yo!

27:00.554 --> 27:01.921
Anybody hear us?! Down here!

27:01.955 --> 27:03.489
Anybody up there?!

27:03.524 --> 27:04.857
Hey!

27:04.892 --> 27:06.291
We're down here!

27:06.326 --> 27:07.626
Hey! Down here!

27:07.660 --> 27:11.630
Fire's too loud. They can't hear us.

27:11.664 --> 27:13.732
I got an idea.

27:13.766 --> 27:16.502
(Breathing heavily)

27:16.536 --> 27:18.770
(Metal clangs)

27:18.804 --> 27:20.472
- Maybe the sound will carry up.
- Yeah.

27:20.507 --> 27:22.807
- Let 'em know we're down here.
- Yeah.

27:22.842 --> 27:26.310
(Metal clanging)

27:26.345 --> 27:27.913
Down here! Hey!

27:27.947 --> 27:29.247
Hey!

27:29.281 --> 27:32.283
Hey! Down here, anybody!

27:32.317 --> 27:33.852
Hey!

27:33.886 --> 27:37.321
(Esposito) Come on! Hey!

27:37.356 --> 27:40.558
(Voices fade)

27:41.385 --> 27:44.013
- Hey!
- Down here! Hey!

27:44.060 --> 27:45.327
Hey!

27:45.362 --> 27:47.195
(Metal clanging)

27:47.229 --> 27:48.363
Hey!

27:48.397 --> 27:49.664
Stop!

27:49.699 --> 27:52.634
(Breathing heavily)

27:52.668 --> 27:55.069
What?

27:55.104 --> 27:57.271
(Exhales)
They can't hear us.

27:57.306 --> 28:00.008
(Object thuds)

28:00.042 --> 28:01.242
We can't just quit, man.

28:01.276 --> 28:05.746
Gotta save our strength.

28:05.780 --> 28:06.981
For what?

28:07.016 --> 28:08.516
Nobody knows we're down here.

28:08.550 --> 28:10.618
It's only a matter of time
before the fire

28:10.652 --> 28:12.487
sucks all the oxygen out of the room.

28:12.521 --> 28:16.224
Gotta be some way... outta here,

28:16.258 --> 28:17.358
some other way of letting them know

28:17.393 --> 28:18.526
that we're down here.

28:18.560 --> 28:20.394
Yeah? Like what?

28:20.428 --> 28:23.531
I don't know. Somethin'.

28:23.565 --> 28:24.665
Yeah.

28:24.699 --> 28:27.535
Well, unless you have... an oxygen tank,

28:27.569 --> 28:30.370
a pair of wings, and a Nomex suit...

28:30.405 --> 28:32.706
we're gonna cook.

28:32.741 --> 28:35.075
(Laughs)

28:35.109 --> 28:37.411
Yeah.
(Breathing heavily)

28:37.445 --> 28:39.979
(Coughs)

28:50.591 --> 28:52.959
Maybe not.

28:54.595 --> 28:56.195
What do you mean they're pulling back?

28:56.229 --> 28:58.264
According to the I.C.,
the building is structurally

28:58.298 --> 29:00.166
compromised and they can't
get their men in.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.568
At this point, they don't feel

29:01.602 --> 29:04.336
that it's a rescue operation anymore.

29:04.371 --> 29:06.405
It's a recovery.

29:06.440 --> 29:08.474
Okay, detective.

29:08.508 --> 29:10.409
Let me know if you hear anything more.

29:10.444 --> 29:12.578
Yes, sir.
(Beep)

29:12.612 --> 29:14.180
Anything?

29:14.214 --> 29:16.848
No, according to McCann's file,
the building was condemned,

29:16.883 --> 29:18.717
but there's nothing here to indicate

29:18.751 --> 29:20.052
why it was the next target.

29:20.087 --> 29:21.587
Beckett!

29:21.621 --> 29:23.422
She was at the police barricades.

29:23.457 --> 29:24.923
Jenny, you shouldn't be here.

29:24.958 --> 29:27.759
The hell I shouldn't.
My husband's in there. (Gasps)

29:27.794 --> 29:28.894
What's... what's going on?

29:28.928 --> 29:29.995
She's having contractions.

29:30.029 --> 29:31.597
You're in labor?

29:31.631 --> 29:32.731
(Lanie) How far apart?

29:32.765 --> 29:34.132
Five minutes, maybe.

29:34.166 --> 29:36.501
Whoa, no. She can't...
we gotta get you to a hospital.

29:36.535 --> 29:38.503
Medic, over here. This woman's in labor.

29:38.537 --> 29:40.872
No. I'm not... I'm not leaving.
Not without Kevin.

29:40.907 --> 29:42.507
Jenny, there's nothing you can do here.

29:42.541 --> 29:44.008
He's inside, Kate.

29:44.042 --> 29:46.010
And if he doesn't make it out,
if this is it...

29:46.044 --> 29:49.180
I need to be here.

29:50.616 --> 29:52.283
Let me at least
get you inside of an ambulance.

29:52.318 --> 29:53.751
You need to lie down so we can make sure

29:53.785 --> 29:55.420
that everything is okay.

29:55.454 --> 29:57.322
Okay, but I'm not leaving without him.

29:57.356 --> 29:59.123
Okay.

30:02.928 --> 30:04.528
I can't believe this is happening.

30:04.562 --> 30:06.631
This is like some kind of a dream.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.735
(Exhales)
I just keep waiting to wake up,

30:10.769 --> 30:12.569
but it's like I can't do anything.

30:12.604 --> 30:15.072
(Exhales)
It's like there's nothing we can do.

30:15.107 --> 30:17.508
All we can do is be here for them.

30:19.844 --> 30:22.646
(Cell phone ringing)

30:22.680 --> 30:24.080
(Beep)
Beckett.

30:24.115 --> 30:26.783
(Static)

30:26.817 --> 30:28.118
Hello?

30:28.153 --> 30:30.820
(Flames crackling)
(Coughs) Beckett?

30:30.855 --> 30:33.189
Beckett? Beckett, can you hear me?

30:33.223 --> 30:34.691
(Static)
Beckett?

30:34.725 --> 30:36.526
Beckett? Can you hear me, Beckett?

30:36.560 --> 30:40.030
Ryan? Ryan, is that you?

30:40.064 --> 30:42.465
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's me, Beckett! Listen, uh...

30:42.499 --> 30:44.200
That building that... that we went into...

30:44.234 --> 30:46.903
uh, it wasn't just
the next arson target.

30:46.937 --> 30:48.271
It... it was his lair.

30:48.305 --> 30:51.040
He rigged it to blow,
and now we're trapped inside.

30:51.074 --> 30:53.643
The whole place is in flames.

30:53.677 --> 30:55.645
Yes, I know, Ryan. We're right outside.

30:55.679 --> 30:57.746
We've got the whole
fire department here.

30:57.781 --> 31:00.316
(Voice breaks)
We thought... you guys were dead.

31:00.350 --> 31:01.884
(Building creaks)

31:01.918 --> 31:04.487
Well, we will be soon
if we don't get some help.

31:08.224 --> 31:09.725
(Radio chatter, sirens wailing)

31:09.759 --> 31:11.193
Exactly where in the building are you?

31:11.227 --> 31:13.662
Some kind of sub-basement
mechanical room

31:13.697 --> 31:16.065
about 20 feet down from the main floor.

31:16.099 --> 31:17.933
There's no windows, no doors.

31:17.967 --> 31:19.935
(Paper rustles)

31:19.969 --> 31:21.969
- Well, this doesn't make any sense.
- Why?

31:22.004 --> 31:23.204
Well, according to these plans,

31:23.206 --> 31:24.539
this building has a slab foundation.

31:24.574 --> 31:25.840
There is no basement area.

31:25.874 --> 31:27.041
Well, I don't know
what to tell you, pal.

31:27.076 --> 31:28.476
We're in some kinda basement.

31:28.511 --> 31:30.812
So there's something wrong
with your freakin' plans.

31:34.149 --> 31:35.684
They're alive?

31:35.718 --> 31:38.052
Yeah, but they're in an unmapped portion

31:38.087 --> 31:40.021
of the building, a sub-basement.

31:40.055 --> 31:42.056
The... the fire crews can't get to them.

31:42.091 --> 31:43.157
We need to find them

31:43.192 --> 31:44.391
another way out of that room.

31:44.426 --> 31:46.186
What makes you think
there's another way out?

31:46.195 --> 31:47.461
The arsonist set the explosives

31:47.495 --> 31:48.462
to go off to eradicate

31:48.496 --> 31:50.031
all evidence if he was ever found.

31:50.065 --> 31:51.599
But what if someone discovered him

31:51.633 --> 31:53.201
while he was still in the building?

31:53.235 --> 31:54.235
He'd need a way out.

31:54.269 --> 31:56.069
That could be the reason
that sub-basement

31:56.104 --> 31:57.404
isn't on the building plans.

31:57.439 --> 31:59.506
I think the arsonist
doctored those plans.

31:59.541 --> 32:00.807
What makes you think that?

32:00.842 --> 32:02.843
Ryan said when they found the workspace,

32:02.877 --> 32:04.845
it was right next to an open air shaft.

32:04.879 --> 32:06.647
That air shaft ran all the way down

32:06.681 --> 32:07.681
to the sub-basement.

32:07.716 --> 32:08.982
You think it's an escape route?

32:09.016 --> 32:10.417
If the cops were to raid this place,

32:10.452 --> 32:12.132
and they're covering
the front and the back

32:12.153 --> 32:13.593
of the building, where's he gonna go?

32:13.621 --> 32:16.322
To the one room
that isn't on their plans.

32:16.357 --> 32:17.390
Then he blows the place,

32:17.424 --> 32:18.658
and everyone thinks he's been killed.

32:18.692 --> 32:20.493
What better way to cover his tracks

32:20.527 --> 32:21.862
than disappear in a fire.

32:21.896 --> 32:23.296
But it only works if there's another way

32:23.330 --> 32:24.430
out of that room.

32:24.465 --> 32:26.499
And the only one to know that

32:26.533 --> 32:28.501
- would be our arsonist.
- We need to find him.

32:28.535 --> 32:30.503
Sir?

32:30.537 --> 32:32.071
I've got something.

32:32.105 --> 32:34.374
(Typing) I went back through
the Pyrolicious web site.

32:34.408 --> 32:36.075
Six of their videos are of fires

32:36.109 --> 32:38.344
attributed to our arsonist.
Each was uploaded

32:38.379 --> 32:40.580
to the site shortly after
the buildings burned.

32:40.614 --> 32:42.214
But here's the interesting part.

32:42.249 --> 32:44.650
One web site member logged in and viewed

32:44.684 --> 32:45.885
each of these videos

32:45.919 --> 32:47.820
just minutes after they were posted.

32:47.854 --> 32:49.288
But only these videos.

32:49.322 --> 32:50.656
That's him.

32:50.690 --> 32:52.591
He's checking out his work.

32:52.625 --> 32:54.226
What's this member's name?
(Types)

32:54.261 --> 32:56.195
I don't have his real name.
Just a user name...

32:56.229 --> 32:58.063
firebug447.

32:58.098 --> 33:00.799
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

33:00.833 --> 33:04.102
The man has an account on your web site.

33:04.136 --> 33:06.571
You charge your users.
How can you not know?

33:06.606 --> 33:08.139
He paid with a cashier's check

33:08.174 --> 33:10.409
back when I was offering
a lifetime membership.

33:10.443 --> 33:11.576
He mailed it in.

33:11.611 --> 33:13.645
- You're lying.
- I swear!

33:13.680 --> 33:15.980
I only know his user name... Firebug447.

33:16.015 --> 33:17.148
You listen to me.

33:17.183 --> 33:19.250
I've got two officers about to burn.

33:19.285 --> 33:20.852
Now, if you know anything
about this man,

33:20.886 --> 33:23.054
you are gonna tell me,
or I will <i>bury</i> you

33:23.088 --> 33:25.623
as an accessory to murder.

33:25.657 --> 33:29.560
We chat sometimes over I.M.

33:29.594 --> 33:30.594
What would he say?

33:30.629 --> 33:32.330
We talk about fire, how buildings burn.

33:32.364 --> 33:35.132
Did he say anything that could help us

33:35.166 --> 33:36.567
identify who he is?

33:36.601 --> 33:38.402
No. I'd sometimes ask.

33:38.437 --> 33:39.737
But he was careful.

33:39.771 --> 33:41.405
He did once say why he did it.

33:41.440 --> 33:44.241
He said he couldn't...
deal with the suffering,

33:44.275 --> 33:46.544
that sometimes sick and dying buildings

33:46.578 --> 33:50.280
need to burn to be put out
of their misery.

33:50.315 --> 33:54.251
(Indistinct shouting, radio chatter)

33:54.285 --> 33:56.253
And you're sure you don't
see another way out?

33:56.287 --> 33:58.521
If there is, it's covered by debris.

33:58.556 --> 34:00.190
Any idea where that way out might be?

34:00.225 --> 34:02.326
Castle's on the phone
with the building department.

34:02.360 --> 34:04.527
He's trying to get ahold
of the original blueprints.

34:04.562 --> 34:06.363
We're assuming there even is a way out.

34:06.397 --> 34:10.600
We're giving this guy
more credit than he deserves.

34:10.634 --> 34:13.135
(Exhales)
We're both getting sleepy.

34:13.170 --> 34:16.473
Carbon monoxide's building up.
(Breathing heavily)

34:16.507 --> 34:19.641
Ryan, you listen to me.
You need to hang on, okay?

34:19.677 --> 34:21.143
They're coming for you.

34:21.178 --> 34:24.646
I appreciate the pep talk,
but we both know

34:24.681 --> 34:28.717
the fire's too hot.
They don't know where to look.

34:28.752 --> 34:29.752
No.

34:29.786 --> 34:31.286
Ryan...

34:31.321 --> 34:35.224
We're gonna lose
the phone soon, Beckett, so...

34:35.259 --> 34:38.293
there's something I need you to do.

34:38.328 --> 34:40.562
(Labored breathing)

34:40.597 --> 34:41.730
Jenny.

34:41.764 --> 34:43.364
What? What is it?

34:43.400 --> 34:45.033
It's him.

34:45.067 --> 34:48.235
It's Kevin?
(Exhales and sniffles)

34:48.270 --> 34:49.370
Is it you?

34:49.405 --> 34:50.905
It's really you?

34:50.938 --> 34:53.674
Yeah. Yeah, it's me, beautiful.

34:53.708 --> 34:56.277
Oh, thank God. Where are you?

34:56.311 --> 34:57.879
The baby's coming.

34:57.913 --> 34:59.847
I'm inside.

34:59.882 --> 35:01.816
Inside...

35:03.385 --> 35:05.019
Uh...

35:07.588 --> 35:10.424
I'm sorry. I know I promised, but...
(Clears throat)

35:10.458 --> 35:11.758
I'm not gonna be there.

35:11.793 --> 35:14.061
(Voice breaks)
Don't say that.

35:14.095 --> 35:16.096
Please, don't say that.

35:16.131 --> 35:18.532
Sorry.

35:18.566 --> 35:22.368
(Groans, exhales deeply)

35:22.403 --> 35:26.005
I love you more than anything.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.074
Remember that.

35:28.108 --> 35:29.443
Always remember that.

35:29.477 --> 35:33.747
(Crying)
Kevin, please. No, don't leave me.

35:33.781 --> 35:37.917
(Chuckling)
I don't wanna.

35:37.952 --> 35:42.555
(Breaths heavily)
We need a name. For the baby.

35:42.589 --> 35:45.291
We need to do that together.

35:45.326 --> 35:50.363
If it's a boy...

35:50.397 --> 35:51.764
Javier.

35:51.798 --> 35:55.835
(Breathing heavily)

35:55.869 --> 36:00.673
(Sniffling)
And if it's a girl?

36:00.707 --> 36:03.776
Sarah Grace, after your grandmother.

36:03.810 --> 36:08.646
(Sniffles)
I love you so much, Kevin.

36:08.681 --> 36:10.349
I love you.

36:10.383 --> 36:14.353
I love you, too...
(Static)

36:14.387 --> 36:18.457
Kevin?
(Crackles)

36:18.491 --> 36:20.558
Kevin?

36:20.593 --> 36:22.694
Kevin?

36:22.728 --> 36:25.563
(Sobbing)

36:35.258 --> 36:38.927
(Breathing heavily)

36:38.961 --> 36:40.362
(Telephone thuds)

36:40.397 --> 36:42.130
"Javier"?

36:42.164 --> 36:45.066
You're gonna name
a white Irish kid "Javier"?

36:45.100 --> 36:49.137
What? You're gonna bust on me
now for being sentimental?

36:49.171 --> 36:51.105
I figure it's my last chance.

36:51.140 --> 36:53.742
(Laughing)

37:01.417 --> 37:05.286
(Exhales)
No.

37:05.320 --> 37:06.620
No, no.

37:06.655 --> 37:08.122
We're getting out of here.
There's a way out,

37:08.157 --> 37:09.890
and we're gonna find it.

37:09.925 --> 37:13.161
I'm not leaving Jenny.

37:13.195 --> 37:15.162
I'm not leaving my baby without a dad.

37:15.196 --> 37:17.698
All right?

37:17.732 --> 37:19.733
Hey, hey! Javi...

37:19.768 --> 37:21.969
No, no, no, Javi.

37:22.003 --> 37:23.904
No, no, no! Don't you dare
fall asleep on me!

37:23.939 --> 37:26.139
Don't you dare, Javi! Javi?!

37:26.174 --> 37:30.177
(Panting)

37:30.211 --> 37:31.844
(Breathing heavily)

37:31.879 --> 37:35.782
(Exhales deeply)

37:35.816 --> 37:37.617
(Panting)

37:37.651 --> 37:40.353
I don't wanna do this, Lanie.

37:40.388 --> 37:41.488
Not without him.

37:41.522 --> 37:43.457
- I know, baby.
- Ooh. (Exhales)

37:43.491 --> 37:45.792
- I know, I'm here. I'm here.
- Mm.

37:45.826 --> 37:48.160
Contractions are two minutes apart.

37:48.195 --> 37:50.129
It's coming.
(Groans)

37:50.163 --> 37:55.201
And we'll do it here. Together. Okay?

37:55.235 --> 37:57.070
(Cries)

37:57.104 --> 37:59.371
Detective.

37:59.406 --> 38:01.273
We may have caught a break.

38:01.308 --> 38:03.876
According to Milo Pavlik,
our arsonist picked his targets

38:03.911 --> 38:05.944
because the buildings
were "sick and dying,"

38:05.979 --> 38:07.980
and "needed to be put
out of their misery."

38:08.014 --> 38:09.881
So, I went back through the files,

38:09.916 --> 38:12.251
all of the building inspector reports,

38:12.285 --> 38:13.352
and he was right.

38:13.386 --> 38:15.821
Each of the targeted buildings
had issues...

38:15.855 --> 38:18.357
structural defects,
wiring problems, rot.

38:18.391 --> 38:20.226
Okay, but how did our guy know that?

38:20.260 --> 38:22.628
He didn't just case the buildings.

38:22.662 --> 38:24.162
He spent time inside.

38:24.196 --> 38:25.864
I think that's what Blake discovered,

38:25.898 --> 38:27.499
how he got on to this place.

38:27.533 --> 38:29.400
Do you have those files
that Ryan and Esposito found?

38:29.435 --> 38:30.769
Yeah, right here.

38:33.472 --> 38:35.741
The building inspection
reports... who signed them?

38:35.775 --> 38:38.976
Uh, "Mark Kimball."

38:39.011 --> 38:40.278
(Exhales)

38:40.312 --> 38:41.912
All of these files, each one,

38:41.947 --> 38:43.548
they have one thing in common...

38:43.582 --> 38:45.650
the building inspector was Mark Kimball.

38:45.684 --> 38:46.917
That's how he got inside the buildings,

38:46.952 --> 38:49.487
operated without being seen.
It was his job.

38:49.522 --> 38:52.023
Which means he had access
to the building department.

38:52.057 --> 38:54.291
That's how he was able
to change building plans

38:54.325 --> 38:57.094
without anyone knowing.
(Typing)

38:57.129 --> 38:59.229
If he's the arsonist,
we have to find him.

39:01.299 --> 39:04.168
Oh, God. He's here.

39:10.975 --> 39:13.610
Kimball! Don't move.

39:15.513 --> 39:19.349
The basement! Is there a way out?

39:19.384 --> 39:20.417
Is there?

39:20.451 --> 39:21.818
I don't know what you're talking about.

39:21.852 --> 39:23.019
The hell you don't!

39:23.054 --> 39:25.355
Is there a way out?

39:28.159 --> 39:29.492
Those guys in there...
they are my friends.

39:29.526 --> 39:30.960
If they die, you die.

39:30.995 --> 39:33.362
What's it gonna be?

39:33.397 --> 39:36.632
It's your choice.

39:39.436 --> 39:41.971
(Flames crackling)

40:01.091 --> 40:06.095
(Pounding)

40:06.129 --> 40:07.763
(Wall thuds)

40:07.797 --> 40:10.232
(Grunting and speaking indistinctly)

40:12.501 --> 40:14.502
(Indistinct speaking continues)

40:14.537 --> 40:16.171
(Man) Check the other one.

40:19.542 --> 40:21.509
(Speaking indistinctly)

40:22.978 --> 40:24.846
Rescue seven, status?

40:24.880 --> 40:27.716
(Static)

40:35.157 --> 40:37.158
Rescue seven, do you have them?

40:39.061 --> 40:41.863
(Static)

40:44.266 --> 40:46.868
Rescue seven, are they alive?

40:47.870 --> 40:49.203
There.

40:50.772 --> 40:53.574
(Panting)

40:57.279 --> 40:59.747
(Coughing)

40:59.781 --> 41:02.750
Espo. Espo.

41:02.784 --> 41:04.985
(Coughing)

41:05.019 --> 41:07.420
You scared us, buddy. You scared us.

41:08.823 --> 41:10.723
Ryan, hey!

41:10.758 --> 41:12.525
You smell great.

41:14.328 --> 41:15.762
(Exhales)

41:15.797 --> 41:17.297
Where's Jenny?

41:17.331 --> 41:20.400
(Radio chatter)

41:20.434 --> 41:21.902
(Baby crying)

41:21.936 --> 41:23.903
(Ryan gasps)

41:23.937 --> 41:25.672
(Baby crying)

41:25.706 --> 41:28.440
(Crying)
Kevin! You're alive.

41:28.474 --> 41:30.074
(Lanie) Javi!

41:30.109 --> 41:33.312
(Muffled voice)
Thank God.

41:33.346 --> 41:35.614
(Kisses)

41:35.648 --> 41:36.881
(Whispers)
Oh.

41:39.852 --> 41:43.288
(Gasps)
You're both beautiful.

41:43.323 --> 41:44.756
Kevin...

41:44.791 --> 41:47.758
I'd like you to meet Sarah Grace.

41:53.999 --> 41:55.499
(Sniffles)

41:55.534 --> 41:56.734
(Giggles)

41:59.004 --> 42:00.038
(Jenny panting)

42:00.072 --> 42:03.307
(Baby giggling and babbling)

42:04.476 --> 42:07.044
(Crying)
