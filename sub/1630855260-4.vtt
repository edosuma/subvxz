00:13.480 --> 00:15.115
(ominous orchestral
music continues)

00:20.961 --> 00:24.031
- The Book of Revelations
talked about the Second Coming.

00:24.065 --> 00:27.368
- Jesus is coming.
(slow orchestral music)

00:27.401 --> 00:28.569
- [Congregation] Amen.

00:28.602 --> 00:29.704
- There are a bunch
of predictions

00:29.737 --> 00:32.506
about what would happen
before the end of the world,

00:32.540 --> 00:34.508
and the imminent
return of Jesus.

00:34.542 --> 00:35.910
- [Speaker] What
will be the sign

00:35.943 --> 00:37.445
when this is about
to take place?

00:38.379 --> 00:40.014
- In a weird way,

00:40.047 --> 00:41.882
a lot of them have
paralleled recent history,

00:41.916 --> 00:44.885
natural disasters.
(wind whistles)

00:44.919 --> 00:46.354
- [Reporter] Explosive wildfire.

00:46.387 --> 00:47.288
- [Reporter] The worst
flooding in a decade.

00:47.321 --> 00:48.389
- [Lech] Pandemics.

00:48.422 --> 00:51.025
- [Reporter] 73,000 cases a day.

00:51.058 --> 00:53.561
- [Lech] Wars, famines.

00:53.594 --> 00:55.596
It has directly fed into a lot

00:55.629 --> 00:58.599
of Brian Houston's prophecies.

00:58.632 --> 01:00.368
- [Speaker] "And
before all of this,

01:00.401 --> 01:02.903
they will lay their hands on
you and will persecute you,

01:02.937 --> 01:05.206
and you'll be brought
before governors

01:05.239 --> 01:07.174
and kings for my namesake."

01:07.208 --> 01:10.444
- He told followers,
"When bad things happen,

01:10.478 --> 01:12.213
you know that good
times are near.

01:12.246 --> 01:13.514
The more bad that happens,

01:13.547 --> 01:16.117
the closer we are
to deliverance."

01:16.150 --> 01:21.055
(motorcycle engine revs)
(light orchestral music)

01:22.890 --> 01:24.058
It's the perfect defense
for Brian Houston

01:24.091 --> 01:26.093
because the more that
he was persecuted,

01:26.127 --> 01:28.863
the more alluring he became
to a lot of his followers.

01:28.896 --> 01:30.097

01:30.131 --> 01:32.066
♪ It's time to go
(congregation cheers)

01:32.099 --> 01:32.967
- He was actually proving
what he was predicting,

01:33.000 --> 01:34.935
which is, "They're
going to come after me.

01:34.969 --> 01:37.204
They're going to
accuse me of things."

01:42.243 --> 01:47.081
- I still want to
have a Pentecostal
two-step when I'm 112.

01:47.114 --> 01:49.917
(congregation cheers)
(congregation applauds)

01:49.950 --> 01:51.118
To me, it's not
about the politics.

01:51.152 --> 01:53.587
It's about the position.

01:53.621 --> 01:55.556
(audience cheers)

01:55.589 --> 01:56.357
- It's just been a real
easy path for you, right?

01:56.390 --> 01:57.925
I mean, it was just kind

01:57.958 --> 01:59.427
of a tiptoe through the
tulips kind of thing.

01:59.460 --> 02:04.231
- [Speaker] "Live, Love, Lead:
Your Best is Yet to Come!"

02:04.265 --> 02:05.199
(Brian laughs)

02:05.232 --> 02:06.600
- For a lot of Pentecostals,

02:06.634 --> 02:09.570
the truest proof of
perfection is persecution.

02:09.603 --> 02:14.041
- Persecuted, but not
forsaken. (laughs)

02:14.075 --> 02:16.010
- As the allegations
and the stumbles

02:16.043 --> 02:18.512
within the church became
more and more public,

02:18.546 --> 02:20.915
Hillsong became
presciently shaped

02:20.948 --> 02:23.517
by defensiveness more
than anything else.

02:23.551 --> 02:24.952
- The battle lines are drawn,

02:24.986 --> 02:26.520
and when it comes
to me and my family,

02:26.554 --> 02:31.092
I believe the gates of Hell
will not prevail against us.

02:31.125 --> 02:33.361
- But there's so much disarray

02:33.394 --> 02:35.096
in the way Brian
has led the church

02:35.129 --> 02:39.233
that Brian's unraveling was
bound to happen at some point.

02:39.266 --> 02:40.935
Some people were bound to
start putting things together.

02:40.968 --> 02:42.103
- Do you think you
could've avoided this

02:42.136 --> 02:43.404
by reporting it to police?

02:43.437 --> 02:44.839
- [Reporter] You
told your followers

02:44.872 --> 02:46.340
that you were ready for battle.

- We are going to
welcome Pastor Bobbie

03:50.104 --> 03:52.807
as she comes to bring the
word, but before we do that,

03:53.708 --> 03:56.110
we
are going to watch an
important announcement

03:56.143 --> 03:58.546
from Pastor Brian and
Bobbie, and so come on,

03:58.579 --> 04:01.048
let's together watch this
important announcement.

04:03.250 --> 04:05.953
- Well, hi, church, it's
been an unexpected season,

04:05.987 --> 04:09.190
and we're thankful for you all

04:09.223 --> 04:13.127
and for the incredible
sense of community we share.

04:13.160 --> 04:16.163
As you know, I received
unexpected news of charges

04:16.197 --> 04:19.567
against me that allege the
concealing of information

04:19.600 --> 04:23.204
that may have been material
to prosecute Frank Houston.

04:23.237 --> 04:26.540
These allegations came as
a complete shock to me,

04:26.574 --> 04:30.511
and it's my intention to
vigorously defend them.

04:30.544 --> 04:32.546
But recently, we made a decision

04:32.580 --> 04:35.216
that may come as a
big surprise to you,

04:35.249 --> 04:38.285
and I wanted you to hear
it from me directly.

04:38.319 --> 04:42.023
Hillsong's external legal
counsel gave the board advice

04:42.056 --> 04:45.226
regarding the current
charge I'm facing,

04:45.259 --> 04:47.128
and that it would
be best practice

04:47.161 --> 04:49.530
for me to step aside completely

04:49.563 --> 04:53.267
from church leadership
during the court proceedings.

04:53.300 --> 04:57.872
So it's likely to be drawn
out and take up most of 2022.

04:58.906 --> 05:01.242
I intend to fight the charge,

05:01.275 --> 05:04.912
and I welcome the opportunity
to set the record straight.

05:04.945 --> 05:06.947
It's important to
note, Bobbie intends

05:06.981 --> 05:09.583
to stay fully engaged
in church life.

05:09.617 --> 05:12.086
(slow orchestral music)

05:12.119 --> 05:13.387
- [David] In most realms,

05:13.421 --> 05:16.390
if a CEO is facing
a criminal charge,

05:16.424 --> 05:19.060
naturally they step aside,
that's just good governance.

05:20.561 --> 05:21.696
The confounding thing here is

05:21.729 --> 05:24.899
that Hillsong's never been
subject to good governance.

05:26.334 --> 05:29.203
So the fact that he
stepped aside meant

05:29.236 --> 05:31.505
that there was absolutely
other elements at play.

05:32.340 --> 05:33.541
- [Bobbie] Smiling,
(laughs) yeah.

05:33.574 --> 05:34.942
- It'll be great.

05:34.976 --> 05:36.210
Wherever you guys
are around the world,

05:36.243 --> 05:37.511
I pray you'll have
a great Sunday.

05:37.545 --> 05:39.347
Thank you.
- [Bobbie] Thank you.

05:39.380 --> 05:43.384
(slow orchestral
music continues)

05:43.417 --> 05:45.586
- One month after
Brian's announcement,

05:45.619 --> 05:47.855
I turned on my computer
in the morning.

05:47.888 --> 05:51.459
There was an email and
it said "Anonymous tip.

05:51.492 --> 05:54.962
Something big is happening
in Hillsong, please call me."

05:54.996 --> 05:56.230
(lively orchestral music)

05:56.263 --> 05:58.132
When I called that
person, they told me

05:58.165 --> 06:02.837
that something was going down
this week with Brian Houston.

06:03.604 --> 06:05.239
A new problem had come to light,

06:05.272 --> 06:08.909
and a few influential leaders
of the church were upset.

06:12.113 --> 06:15.216
The fact that I was in touch
with a source was a big deal.

06:15.249 --> 06:19.520
Hillsong is protecting itself
nearly all the time (laughs)

06:19.553 --> 06:22.556
because churches like Hillsong
and people like the Houstons,

06:22.590 --> 06:25.226
they thrive on opaque systems.

06:25.259 --> 06:28.229
They don't want anybody really
knowing what's going on.

06:30.631 --> 06:32.900
- Why is it hard for people

06:32.933 --> 06:34.602
to speak out against
Hillsong Church?

06:34.635 --> 06:36.937
Because they've signed
NDAs, (laughs) that's why.

06:38.539 --> 06:43.044
We signed such an ironclad NDA
that kind of eliminated our-

06:43.077 --> 06:43.878
- [Interviewer] Just gonna
put that on the record,

06:43.911 --> 06:45.880
you do not need to
talk about that.

06:45.913 --> 06:48.349
- It does feel,
it does feel off.

06:48.382 --> 06:52.053
It does feel like, you know,

06:52.086 --> 06:54.288
people should be able to
say what they need to say.

06:54.322 --> 06:56.123
(slow orchestral music)

06:56.157 --> 06:57.892
- God wants to be
able to trust you.

06:59.093 --> 07:00.928
- Why does a church need an NDA?

07:03.597 --> 07:06.967
The megachurch is a
giant corporation.

07:08.402 --> 07:10.071
They're employing
hundreds of people.

07:10.104 --> 07:12.006
They're taking in
millions of dollars.

07:12.039 --> 07:14.175
They're managing
hundreds of thousands

07:14.208 --> 07:15.910
of square feet of property.

07:17.611 --> 07:19.547
As an organization,
you start going,

07:19.580 --> 07:22.316
"Well, how do we
protect ourselves?"

07:22.350 --> 07:26.087
And the models that you adopt
come from the corporate world.

07:26.120 --> 07:30.091
You start building an HR process
like any other corporation.

07:30.124 --> 07:33.260
You start hiring lawyers
like any other corporation,

07:33.294 --> 07:34.962
and it just goes
on down the list.

07:38.499 --> 07:42.136
- Some people would say that's
standard for a business.

07:42.169 --> 07:44.405
I don't know if it's becoming
standard for churches.

07:46.107 --> 07:47.908
- Because they've adopted
the corporate model,

07:47.942 --> 07:50.544
they've adopted these
corporate safeguards.

07:50.578 --> 07:53.214
Now, of course they're not
protecting trade secrets.

07:54.582 --> 07:56.384
That's where it gets
really troubling.

07:57.418 --> 07:58.552
What are they protecting?

08:03.224 --> 08:05.793
(slow music)

08:11.399 --> 08:12.466
- When you probe deeper,

08:12.500 --> 08:18.039
you find that there has
been a building resentment

08:18.072 --> 08:21.876
towards the old boys'
club that runs Hillsong.

08:22.710 --> 08:26.414
That building resentment
revealed, I think,

08:26.447 --> 08:30.918
the seeds ultimately for the
destruction of Brain Houston.

08:32.453 --> 08:36.424
It all really kicked
off at Hillsong College.

08:39.527 --> 08:43.297
(slow rhythmic music)

08:43.331 --> 08:45.199
- Within the first week, when
everyone's arrived to start,

08:45.232 --> 08:47.968
they interviewed
us individually.

08:48.002 --> 08:51.205
- They would bring us into
a room of about 20 pastors,

08:51.238 --> 08:53.541
and just with a single
chair facing each other.

08:53.574 --> 08:55.443
- It was actually
kind of intimidating.

08:56.978 --> 08:58.212
- We were being told

08:58.245 --> 09:00.247
we were doing a working
with children's check.

09:00.281 --> 09:02.249
We had to tell them

09:03.985 --> 09:06.420
kind of all of our deepest,
darkest secrets, really.

09:07.955 --> 09:10.925
Have you masturbated
in the last year?

09:10.958 --> 09:13.427
Have you had sex
in the last year?

09:13.461 --> 09:14.595
Have you ever hallucinated

09:14.628 --> 09:16.230
that a demon was
standing right there,

09:16.263 --> 09:17.898
or have you ever seen one?

09:17.932 --> 09:19.934
- You're not meant
to get new tattoos.

09:19.967 --> 09:21.068
You're not meant to date.

09:22.336 --> 09:24.572
Obviously you're
not meant to be gay.

09:24.605 --> 09:26.340
It could potentially mean

09:26.374 --> 09:28.075
that you can't be
in college anymore.

09:30.911 --> 09:34.115
- You learn how to keep secrets
then, because you're like,

09:34.148 --> 09:36.951
no one in here has looked
at porn ever, really?

09:36.984 --> 09:39.587
Okay, well, me neither.

09:39.620 --> 09:44.358
Nobody in here thought lustfully
about a woman all month?

09:44.392 --> 09:46.293
Me neither, 'cause otherwise,

09:46.327 --> 09:48.295
they're going to start
looking at you like,

09:48.329 --> 09:50.431
"This guy probably isn't
cut out for ministry."

09:51.966 --> 09:54.135
- I thought, I want to
be a truthful person,

09:54.168 --> 09:55.936
and nothing bad can come
from the truth, right?

09:55.970 --> 09:58.272
Like, the truth
should set you free.

09:59.407 --> 10:00.941
"Have you ever watched porn?"

10:00.975 --> 10:02.209
I said, "Yes."

10:02.243 --> 10:04.345
"Have you masturbated
in the last six months?"

10:04.378 --> 10:05.946
I said, "Yes."

10:05.980 --> 10:07.948
"Have you had sex
in the last year?"

10:07.982 --> 10:09.517
I said, "Yes."

10:09.550 --> 10:11.485
- When they would write all
that down on a little iPad,

10:11.519 --> 10:13.220
and then immediately afterwards,

10:13.254 --> 10:16.290
you would get your working
with children's check tag

10:16.324 --> 10:18.526
and you have to put it on,
and if you had a red dot,

10:18.559 --> 10:21.395
everyone who sees you in
the church knows that,

10:22.463 --> 10:24.432
you know, you're struggling.

10:25.466 --> 10:26.934
You were blacklisted.

10:31.372 --> 10:35.810
- I hadn't even told anyone
that I thought I might be gay

10:35.843 --> 10:38.112
when I came to
college, but back then,

10:38.145 --> 10:41.382
it's like you're struggling
with homosexuality.

10:41.415 --> 10:43.284
That language was really
important, you know?

10:43.317 --> 10:45.953
It's not something that
you are, it's a behavior,

10:45.987 --> 10:48.055
and therefore it's
something you can change.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.927
- My mission was
to be a drummer.

10:54.128 --> 10:55.896
I've been volunteering my heart
out for the past two years.

10:55.930 --> 10:57.298
I've been working 60 hour weeks.

10:57.331 --> 10:59.467
I've been putting my effort
in, putting my dues in.

11:01.602 --> 11:05.272
I was shortlisted to go
to Indonesia for a tour,

11:05.306 --> 11:06.374
and I was gonna get it.

11:08.376 --> 11:12.413
Then a senior staff
member approached me

11:12.446 --> 11:14.548
and asked some questions

11:14.582 --> 11:16.817
that I've never,
ever shared with him.

11:19.453 --> 11:22.223
Turns out they had written
in my permanent file

11:22.256 --> 11:24.558
that I had a homosexual
experience when I was younger,

11:24.592 --> 11:28.396
which didn't happen,
and I, (sighs)

11:30.965 --> 11:33.968
which wasn't, it was
actually a molestation

11:34.001 --> 11:35.970
from my old church
that I went to.

11:38.973 --> 11:40.541
He said, "Nope, you're
not gonna be able

11:40.574 --> 11:42.910
to come on tour or
any other tours."

11:44.145 --> 11:46.047
And after that conversation,

11:46.080 --> 11:49.550
I knew I will never
progress further than this.

11:50.751 --> 11:54.055
As soon as homosexuality comes
up, they shake their head,

11:54.088 --> 11:56.257
and, "No," like,
can't, you can't.

11:57.558 --> 12:00.394
- I couldn't handle
the guilt of being gay.

12:01.962 --> 12:04.231
I ended up coming to a
teacher who I trusted.

12:04.265 --> 12:07.234
They asked me to start
coming into the offices

12:07.268 --> 12:09.937
and to see a counselor
that they had just hired

12:09.971 --> 12:13.240
so that I can stop having
these tendencies to love women.

12:14.375 --> 12:15.576
Counseling with the purpose

12:15.609 --> 12:20.915
of figuring out
why you may be gay

12:22.083 --> 12:25.353
is now what we know as a soft
version of conversion therapy,

12:25.386 --> 12:27.021
and it's dangerous.

12:29.590 --> 12:33.794
- We, as college students,
were penalized for being human,

12:35.096 --> 12:39.729
penalized for, (sighs) yeah.

12:39.934 --> 12:43.004
(slow music continues)

12:45.906 --> 12:47.875
(slow orchestral music)

12:50.953 --> 12:53.256
- Having grown up in
the Hillsong movement,

12:55.058 --> 12:56.426
I feel it is a responsibility
for Christians to stand up

12:56.459 --> 12:58.961
and actually start speaking
out against the abuse,

13:00.263 --> 13:03.499
so I started up a website
called ChurchWatch.

13:03.533 --> 13:08.071
(slow orchestral
music continues)

13:08.104 --> 13:09.872
My focus wasn't just on Frank,

13:09.906 --> 13:12.275
it was Hillsong and
its history, as well.

13:12.308 --> 13:15.878
I was encouraging a whole bunch
of people to work in there,

13:15.912 --> 13:17.914
to share their stories
and information.

13:17.947 --> 13:20.149
I was hoping because
it was so well-reasoned

13:20.183 --> 13:21.317
that a lot of Christians

13:21.351 --> 13:23.152
for the first time
could understand the way

13:23.186 --> 13:25.088
that Hillsong has
conducted itself.

13:27.190 --> 13:30.126
I had to do this anonymously
for the last 12 years.

13:31.994 --> 13:36.199
- For so many years, we were
all isolated and disconnected,

13:36.232 --> 13:40.303
any of us who had not had a
positive experience at Hillsong,

13:40.336 --> 13:44.006
and it wasn't until sites
like Facebook became available

13:44.040 --> 13:45.641
for people to
connect and realize

13:45.675 --> 13:47.977
that they had quite similar

13:48.010 --> 13:51.147
if not identical
experiences to each other,

13:51.180 --> 13:53.816
and that they weren't the
problem, the system was.

13:56.285 --> 13:59.422
- There's a Facebook page
with a lot, a lot of us,

14:00.623 --> 14:02.158
and it actually
happened by accident.

14:02.191 --> 14:05.895
Someone posted something
a little bit controversial

14:05.928 --> 14:09.565
on the main Hillsong
College page,

14:09.599 --> 14:11.434
and College immediately replied

14:13.169 --> 14:15.104
and took the post down and
started censoring all of us.

14:16.339 --> 14:18.007
And so someone made
a support group.

14:18.941 --> 14:22.578
Within one week, we had
over 300, 400 members,

14:22.612 --> 14:24.180
and people sharing their stories

14:24.213 --> 14:25.481
and getting healing from it.

14:29.519 --> 14:32.155
- The group on Facebook started,

14:32.188 --> 14:34.424
and it was really when
my perspective changed.

14:36.025 --> 14:39.429
It gave me the chance
to say my piece

14:39.462 --> 14:42.432
and for other people
to come along and say,

14:42.465 --> 14:43.933
"That's actually not okay.

14:43.966 --> 14:46.169
Like, those things
are not acceptable."

14:48.271 --> 14:50.106
- We've been
hearing about people

14:50.139 --> 14:53.242
who've been coming out
of the Hillsong movement

14:53.276 --> 14:55.611
who've been deeply wounded,
who've been rejected.

14:57.647 --> 14:58.514
You're supposed to
act a certain way

14:58.548 --> 15:00.416
and think a certain
way and filter it

15:00.450 --> 15:05.254
through all these particular
doctrines and beliefs.

15:05.288 --> 15:06.589
I look back now and go,

15:06.622 --> 15:08.925
"I can't believe I put
myself through that."

15:10.326 --> 15:13.262
- Hillsong had a real
fluency and mastery

15:13.296 --> 15:15.098
of some of the pop culture

15:15.131 --> 15:17.400
and social media
levers of the day.

15:17.433 --> 15:19.268
- [Speaker] A decade later,

15:19.302 --> 15:22.338
those same tools were used by
ex-congregants and students

15:22.372 --> 15:24.407
to tell a very different story.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.943
This time, they cracked
open the Hillsong facade.

15:29.278 --> 15:32.648
- Over the years, I think
people felt much more safer

15:32.682 --> 15:37.487
to start to criticize on
Instagram, Facebook, YouTube.

15:39.288 --> 15:42.859
- And so you get from
the Hillsong College

15:42.892 --> 15:45.895
and social media kind
of a Me Too movement

15:45.928 --> 15:48.464
against Hillsong in Australia.

15:48.498 --> 15:52.268
The whole Anna Crenshaw
Hillsong College episode

15:52.301 --> 15:53.569
really did erupt, actually,

15:53.603 --> 15:55.271
and blow up in the
face of Hillsong.

15:56.973 --> 15:58.408
(heart beats)

15:58.441 --> 15:59.575
- [Speaker] Anna Crenshaw
first told her story

15:59.609 --> 16:00.977
to "Vanity Fair."

16:04.313 --> 16:08.918
She was groped by a
young Hillsong staffer
named Jason Mays.

16:09.585 --> 16:10.520
(slow ominous music)

16:10.553 --> 16:12.455
- When she complained about it,

16:12.488 --> 16:16.959
the whole protective mechanism
of Hillsong College swung in.

16:18.327 --> 16:19.996
She was kind of given
a pat on the head

16:20.029 --> 16:22.265
and told to kind of
get on with things.

16:22.298 --> 16:24.267
- [Speaker] Hillsong
tried to make it go away,

16:24.300 --> 16:25.968
so she went to the police

16:26.002 --> 16:28.638
and pressed charges
against Jason Mays.

16:28.671 --> 16:31.474
Mays wound up pleading
guilty to indecent assault,

16:31.507 --> 16:33.376
and he received two
years' probation

16:33.409 --> 16:34.977
and mandatory counseling.

16:36.112 --> 16:38.614
This is one of those cases
where the law sided with Anna,

16:38.648 --> 16:41.284
but Brian Houston and
Hillsong really came

16:41.317 --> 16:42.952
to Jason's rescue.

16:42.985 --> 16:45.922
- I found out from LinkedIn

16:45.955 --> 16:50.059
that he was given a better
job during that time.

16:51.994 --> 16:53.930
- [Speaker] Hillsong seemed
anxious to forgive and forget,

16:53.963 --> 16:56.366
but Anna decided
to go to the press.

16:56.399 --> 16:57.967
- You know, I felt like

16:58.000 --> 17:01.270
I was the one who was
in trouble, not him.

17:01.304 --> 17:03.272
- [Reporter] The Crenshaws
believe Jason Mays

17:03.306 --> 17:05.475
was given preferential treatment

17:05.508 --> 17:09.946
because his father is Hillsong's
head of Human Resources.

17:11.481 --> 17:14.984
- We're not talking about
a sexual predator here.

17:15.018 --> 17:19.022
We're talking about a young
man, young married man,

17:19.055 --> 17:21.958
who did something stupid, got
much drunker than he should,

17:21.991 --> 17:24.594
which is an issue we've
got to keep addressing,

17:24.627 --> 17:29.465
and got himself in a bad
situation, that's it.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.902
- He said that Jason was
just in a bad situation,

17:32.935 --> 17:35.438
as if something
happened to Jason.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.941
- These factors
of discrimination,

17:38.975 --> 17:41.978
the lack of justice,
kind of coalesced

17:42.011 --> 17:44.981
to produce some real
anger and a real backlash,

17:45.581 --> 17:48.117
people who are of a generation

17:48.151 --> 17:50.453
that is prepared not to
just go along with it,

17:50.486 --> 17:54.157
but actually to make sure
the voice is somehow heard.

17:55.458 --> 17:57.560
Whoever has engineered
the anonymous tips

17:57.593 --> 18:01.064
to me really wanted to
underline the hypocrisy

18:01.097 --> 18:02.498
of what Brian did,

18:02.532 --> 18:05.234
that while he's telling
everybody else to be perfect,

18:05.268 --> 18:07.003
Brian's holding this secret.

18:10.973 --> 18:12.341
(slow music)

18:12.375 --> 18:14.577
- I think the fact that a
church in Australia is blessed,

18:14.610 --> 18:16.479
God's blessing us, it's growing,

18:16.512 --> 18:18.581
it's got momentum,
it's got movement,

18:18.614 --> 18:21.417
man, it makes some people
out there so angry.

18:21.451 --> 18:23.386
- Towards the beginning of 2020,

18:23.419 --> 18:25.555
before Hillsong
became the subject

18:25.588 --> 18:30.293
of this international
media conflagration,

18:30.326 --> 18:31.861
(slow dramatic music)

18:31.894 --> 18:33.129
two men got together
to play golf.

18:34.163 --> 18:36.466
(slow music)

18:39.135 --> 18:41.304
They had both been
Hillsong congregants,

18:41.337 --> 18:43.439
but one of them had left
the church recently.

18:45.675 --> 18:48.411
The man who hadn't left the
church started asking his friend

18:48.444 --> 18:50.980
what happened, what
had gone wrong?

18:51.013 --> 18:53.916
The man revealed that his
mother had had an encounter

18:53.950 --> 18:56.486
with Brian Houston in
a hotel room in Sydney,

18:58.988 --> 19:00.456
and he produced the
confidentiality agreement

19:00.490 --> 19:02.925
that his mother had signed.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.597
After these two men
played golf, the man

19:07.630 --> 19:10.933
who hadn't left the church
called a spiritual mentor,

19:10.967 --> 19:13.436
concerned about what
he had just learned,

19:13.469 --> 19:15.471
and his mentor immediately
believed the story

19:15.505 --> 19:18.107
because his wife had in fact
had a similar experience.

19:20.343 --> 19:23.179
About a decade earlier, Brian
had been sending text messages

19:23.212 --> 19:26.416
to her that made her feel
increasingly uncomfortable.

19:26.449 --> 19:28.951
She also signed a
confidentiality agreement.

19:30.453 --> 19:32.488
- [Speaker] So you have
material that was supposed

19:32.522 --> 19:36.859
to be sealed under an NDA
that turns into gossip

19:36.893 --> 19:39.429
that circulates around the
church that reporters hear.

19:43.332 --> 19:45.268
- My source said that Brian

19:45.301 --> 19:48.104
and Hillsong had paid out
hush money to the two women

19:48.137 --> 19:51.974
and that they had signed
nondisclosure agreements,

19:52.008 --> 19:59.095
and that word of this had
now got to the elders,

19:59.129 --> 20:02.465
and one elder in
particular, Dr. Gordon Lee,

20:02.499 --> 20:03.967
was very worked up about this.

20:05.335 --> 20:07.003
Dr. Gordon Lee was the physician

20:07.037 --> 20:10.840
who signed off on the idea
that Frank had dementia.

20:12.776 --> 20:15.111
- It seems at this point
Brian has become more

20:15.145 --> 20:17.948
of a liability than an asset.

20:17.981 --> 20:19.983
- [Alex] So for someone
like Gordon Lee,

20:20.016 --> 20:22.452
who had really stuck by
Brian's side for a long time,

20:22.485 --> 20:24.154
there's only so much you can do.

20:25.488 --> 20:28.825
- Gordon Lee began
speaking to donors

20:28.858 --> 20:31.194
about Brian Houston's
transgressions.

20:33.163 --> 20:34.998
There was this mounting tension

20:35.031 --> 20:37.767
that was threatening the bottom
line in a very direct way.

20:39.736 --> 20:42.973
The source told me
that there was going

20:43.006 --> 20:46.109
to be a major meeting, and
it was gonna be on Zoom.

20:46.142 --> 20:50.914
They offered to get me a
recording of the entire meeting,

20:52.349 --> 20:54.117
and that is indeed
what happened.

20:55.151 --> 20:58.989
(slow ominous music)

20:59.022 --> 20:59.789
- So,

21:01.291 --> 21:03.994
I have the responsibility

21:04.027 --> 21:07.831
of sharing with you some news.

21:08.765 --> 21:13.136
There are two incidents
involving Pastor Brian

21:13.169 --> 21:17.107
that as a board we
have had to deal with.

21:17.140 --> 21:21.978
The first incident involved
Pastor Brian text messaging

21:23.747 --> 21:27.784
with a female member of
staff along the lines of,

21:29.152 --> 21:30.820
"If I was with you, I'd
like to give you a kiss

21:30.854 --> 21:33.757
and a cuddle, or a hug,"
words of that nature.

21:35.392 --> 21:40.130
That particular staff member
was obviously upset by that.

21:42.199 --> 21:44.768
- The text messages Brian had
been sending led the woman

21:44.801 --> 21:45.936
to resign from her job.

21:45.969 --> 21:49.372
- This particular
staff member came back

21:49.406 --> 21:51.708
'cause she couldn't get work.

21:51.741 --> 21:52.776
- Hillsong leaders set
up a meeting with her,

21:52.809 --> 21:55.478
and they asked her
what she wanted

21:55.512 --> 21:57.414
to sort of make
all this go away,

21:57.447 --> 21:59.149
and she said that
she just wanted

21:59.182 --> 22:02.852
to be paid the salary she had
lost since she had resigned.

22:02.886 --> 22:05.789
And they said, "Instead,
how about $25,000

22:05.822 --> 22:07.991
and a confidentiality
agreement?"

22:08.024 --> 22:11.494
- Pastor Brian said, "I
want to pay that personally

22:11.528 --> 22:14.831
'cause I don't think it's fair
on the church to pay that."

22:14.864 --> 22:18.435
- That secret was kept for 10
years inside the organization

22:18.468 --> 22:20.971
and known apparently
to only two people.

22:21.004 --> 22:23.406
- Personally I was
not aware of that,

22:23.440 --> 22:27.244
as was the majority
of the global board.

22:27.277 --> 22:29.279
- Spool forward to 2019,

22:31.014 --> 22:33.950
there's Brian's 40 minutes
inside the hotel room

22:33.984 --> 22:37.187
of a woman who was a
supporter of Hillsong.

22:37.220 --> 22:38.855
Brian's said to be drunk.

22:38.889 --> 22:42.292
Brian's said not to have
had his key to his room,

22:42.325 --> 22:44.394
found himself
knocking on her door,

22:44.427 --> 22:46.429
found himself inside there.

22:46.463 --> 22:48.298
(slow ominous music continues)

22:48.331 --> 22:52.903
- Brian has said there
was no sexual activity,

22:52.936 --> 22:57.107
but he was in the
room for 40 minutes.

22:57.140 --> 23:01.144
He doesn't have much
of a recollection
because of, he says,

23:01.177 --> 23:05.115
the mixture of the anxiety
tablets and the alcohol.

23:07.384 --> 23:10.320
- The woman complained,
ah, what did they do?

23:10.353 --> 23:13.890
They returned her donation

23:13.924 --> 23:17.928
and her conference fees,
the minimum possible.

23:19.162 --> 23:22.766
- Again, Pastor Brian
with remorse said,

23:22.799 --> 23:25.235
"I don't want the church
to have to pay that.

23:26.870 --> 23:28.672
I will personally pay that."

23:29.606 --> 23:33.310
These allegations were
treated very seriously,

23:35.178 --> 23:39.115
and I believe, you know, real
significant steps were taken

23:40.150 --> 23:42.485
to investigate and resolve them.

23:42.519 --> 23:44.854
- Again, we have this
same old pattern.

23:46.056 --> 23:48.825
We have an investigation
team appointed.

23:48.858 --> 23:51.828
The investigation team is
meant to be independent.

23:52.996 --> 23:54.164
When you look more
closely, you find out

23:54.197 --> 23:57.000
that three of the four
are old mates of Brian,

23:57.033 --> 24:01.271
and so we have a
Hillsong-curated
version of those events.

24:01.304 --> 24:04.274
The women involved had no voice.

24:04.307 --> 24:06.810
- The decision
was made to offer,

24:07.978 --> 24:09.346
I suppose, what I
would call grace,

24:11.514 --> 24:15.685
and not to cover up,
but to not expose.

24:17.320 --> 24:19.256
- The source told me that they

24:19.289 --> 24:21.958
and others were
determined this time

24:21.992 --> 24:24.995
that Hillsong would not
control the narrative,

24:25.028 --> 24:28.265
and that's why they wanted
to leak the entire audio

24:28.298 --> 24:29.966
of the meeting to me.

24:31.234 --> 24:32.969
- And I would hope that,

24:33.003 --> 24:35.739
I don't know if people
are recording this,

24:35.772 --> 24:38.275
I would hope not. (laughs)

24:38.308 --> 24:40.277
- Within five minutes of
that meeting finished,

24:40.310 --> 24:43.480
I had a file and was
able to write a report,

24:43.513 --> 24:45.949
which I got out in
about 30 minutes.

24:49.219 --> 24:52.422
It was the day that
Houston lost Hillsong.

24:52.455 --> 24:55.725
It was also the day Hillsong
lost control of the narrative.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.403
(slow music)

25:06.436 --> 25:09.239
- Brian could say that
Carl's bad behavior

25:09.272 --> 25:09.868
was just a Hillsong
New York problem.

25:09.901 --> 25:11.636
- There were leadership issues.

25:11.670 --> 25:13.872
- And he had no idea about
his father's transgressions.

25:13.905 --> 25:17.943
- These allegations came
as a complete shock to me,

25:17.976 --> 25:21.546
and it's my intention to
vigorously defend them.

25:21.580 --> 25:25.450
- [Alex] But I really
wonder how Brian explains

25:25.483 --> 25:28.053
away paying hush money
for his own bad behavior.

25:30.388 --> 25:33.558
- It's a fall from grace
of biblical proportions.

25:34.759 --> 25:37.762
Brian Houston's
45-year reign as head

25:37.796 --> 25:41.867
of the huge Hillsong Church
has come to a shocking end.

25:43.668 --> 25:46.771
- Brian Houston has quit
the megachurch following

25:46.805 --> 25:49.007
an internal investigation
revealing inappropriate behavior

25:49.040 --> 25:50.976
towards two women.

25:51.009 --> 25:52.410
- [Reporter] The
announcement was made

25:52.444 --> 25:54.479
at an emergency
meeting yesterday.

25:54.513 --> 25:56.581
- Dear church, we would
like to advise you

25:56.615 --> 25:58.884
that Pastor Brian
Houston has resigned

25:58.917 --> 26:02.053
as global senior pastor
of Hillsong Church,

26:02.087 --> 26:04.623
and the board has
accepted his resignation.

26:06.458 --> 26:10.529
We understand there will be
much emotion at this news,

26:10.562 --> 26:12.364
and we all share these feelings.

26:14.966 --> 26:18.403
- Suddenly we got a very, very
different picture of Brian,

26:19.938 --> 26:24.442
so I think it cracked open wide
the whole edifice of trust,

26:24.476 --> 26:27.412
the whole edifice of
Brian knowing best.

26:27.445 --> 26:30.615
It just disappeared in a moment.

26:31.917 --> 26:33.385
- Hillsong Church
was birthed out

26:33.418 --> 26:35.987
of Brian and Bobbie's
obedience and commitment

26:36.021 --> 26:38.957
to the call of God, and
we are extremely grateful

26:38.990 --> 26:43.428
for all that Brian and Bobbie
have given to build his house.

26:43.461 --> 26:44.830
- Resign?

26:44.863 --> 26:46.364
(both laughing)

26:46.398 --> 26:48.366
- Like, sure, of his
own free will, sure.

26:52.571 --> 26:55.373
- When Brian's
resignation was announced,

26:55.407 --> 26:56.641
one thing that stood out is

26:56.675 --> 26:58.410
that we didn't actually
hear directly from him.

27:00.145 --> 27:04.416
He emails a pro forma apology
to Hillsong congregants,

27:04.449 --> 27:07.552
but as far as what he
presented to the public,

27:08.787 --> 27:10.722
it's really just a
few social media posts

27:10.755 --> 27:13.491
and effectively
pleas for sympathy.

27:14.559 --> 27:15.861
Then he does what
his father did,

27:17.429 --> 27:18.897
instead of address
these matters in public,

27:18.930 --> 27:20.031
he goes on vacation.

27:20.065 --> 27:23.802
(slow orchestral music)

27:23.835 --> 27:27.405
(scooter engines revving)

27:29.508 --> 27:31.376
But at Hillsong, the
wheels really fall off.

27:32.677 --> 27:34.112
The US branches
start shuttering.

27:34.145 --> 27:37.415
Even the people who
this place was set up

27:38.383 --> 27:40.352
to really benefit were
starting to jump ship,

27:41.686 --> 27:43.889
such as Hillsong Phoenix
Pastor Terry Crist.

27:43.922 --> 27:46.424
- Let's build a culture
where truth can be told

27:46.458 --> 27:49.928
without fear of repercussion,
(congregation applauds)

27:49.961 --> 27:52.531
without NDAs and non-competes.

27:54.766 --> 27:57.035
- [Dan] Hillsong Atlanta
Pastor Sam Collier.

27:57.068 --> 27:59.538
- People don't come
to church for scandal.

27:59.571 --> 28:01.873
They come to church
to have a safe place.

28:01.907 --> 28:05.343
- [Dan] Hillsong Boston
Pastors Leona and Josh Kimes,

28:05.377 --> 28:07.345
as well as prominent
members of the board.

28:08.213 --> 28:09.114
The music, which is
really the calling card

28:09.147 --> 28:10.615
of the church, takes a huge hit.

28:13.752 --> 28:16.988
- [Speaker] Worship leaders
should strongly reconsider

28:17.022 --> 28:20.125
playing Hillsong music in
their worship services.

28:20.158 --> 28:23.028
- Suddenly it wasn't so great

28:23.061 --> 28:26.331
for Scott Morrison to be
friends with Brian Houston.

28:26.364 --> 28:27.866
- I mean, I haven't
been at Hillsong now

28:27.899 --> 28:30.502
for over about 15 years.

28:30.535 --> 28:32.671
I go to a local church
in my own community,

28:32.704 --> 28:34.973
a Pentecostal church, I
think everybody knows that.

28:35.006 --> 28:37.776
- Who's in charge,
who's running the board?

28:37.809 --> 28:40.879
Who's gonna be left to clean
up all of the remaining messes?

28:40.912 --> 28:42.714
(congregation applauds)

28:42.747 --> 28:45.317
- Phil Dooley is trying to
fill Brian Houston's shoes,

28:46.952 --> 28:48.420
but, you know,

28:50.622 --> 28:52.958
the beanie, the curly hair,

28:52.991 --> 28:55.794
I'm sorry, it's something
of a pale imitation.

28:55.827 --> 28:57.963
He doesn't project the personal
power of Brian Houston.

28:59.965 --> 29:03.034
- This is not necessarily
an inspiring night, okay?

29:05.403 --> 29:10.509
(slow orchestral
music continues)

29:10.542 --> 29:11.776
- [Interviewer] Why are you
breaking your silence today?

29:11.810 --> 29:14.479
- So, I think it's
safe to come out now,

29:15.947 --> 29:18.550
only because of what Hillsong
is now going through,

29:19.985 --> 29:21.553
to actually stand
up, pretty much.

29:23.088 --> 29:24.689
The Goliath is on its back.

29:24.723 --> 29:28.026
(slow music)

29:28.059 --> 29:29.461
- As the allegations
and the stumbles

29:29.494 --> 29:32.030
within the church became
more and more public,

29:32.063 --> 29:34.065
it made the reporting
process a lot easier.

29:36.001 --> 29:37.602
More whistleblowers
started to come forward.

29:39.104 --> 29:40.539
- [Reporter] For the first time,

29:40.572 --> 29:42.541
detailed allegations of
financial impropriety

29:42.574 --> 29:45.710
by the megachurch have
been made public thanks

29:45.744 --> 29:48.480
to a lawsuit brought
in the federal court

29:48.513 --> 29:50.482
by the church's own bookkeeper.

29:52.517 --> 29:54.953
- [Dan] Natalie Moses
observed an array

29:54.986 --> 29:57.422
of what she said were
unethical accounting practices.

30:00.058 --> 30:01.526
- It always amazes me,

30:01.560 --> 30:03.728
with all that our church
is doing to help people,

30:05.497 --> 30:07.532
that some people can't look
past my motorbike and a watch.

30:09.067 --> 30:11.770
Yes, I do have a nice watch,
but I don't think that's a sign

30:11.803 --> 30:14.472
that I'm living this
massively over-affluent life.

30:15.473 --> 30:18.877
(slow music continues)

30:18.910 --> 30:20.779
- [Dan] Natalie Moses tried
to pursue internal methods,

30:20.812 --> 30:24.482
and when she was met with
resistance, she was fired.

30:26.818 --> 30:29.521
- Natalie Moses claims
she discovered a range

30:29.554 --> 30:32.390
of financial schemes,
large cash gifts given

30:32.424 --> 30:33.592
to members of the church,

30:33.625 --> 30:35.360
including its founder
Brian Houston,

30:36.962 --> 30:39.397
as well as the remittance of
large sums of money overseas

30:39.431 --> 30:42.434
to avoid scrutiny
by local regulators.

30:44.402 --> 30:46.104
- Churches aren't corporations,

30:46.137 --> 30:47.806
so they're not held to account

30:47.839 --> 30:49.574
by the corporate regulator
and shareholders.

30:49.608 --> 30:51.343
They're not government agencies,

30:51.376 --> 30:53.812
so they're not held to account
by the sort of usual measures

30:53.845 --> 30:56.715
in politics that hold
government agencies to account.

30:56.748 --> 30:58.116
They kind of live
in their own space,

30:58.149 --> 30:59.818
and if there's
something we've learned

30:59.851 --> 31:02.954
from the royal commission, it's
that there's an expectation

31:02.988 --> 31:04.322
that something would happen.

31:05.991 --> 31:09.060
(slow music continues)

31:11.997 --> 31:13.532
But again, it became apparent

31:14.900 --> 31:17.435
that nothing was happening.

31:18.403 --> 31:21.473
(slow music continues)

31:36.521 --> 31:38.890
(slow piano music)

31:38.924 --> 31:39.925
- The member for Clark.

31:39.958 --> 31:41.726
- Thank you, Deputy Speaker.

31:41.760 --> 31:44.563
Hillsong is breaking
numerous laws in Australia

31:44.596 --> 31:46.598
and around the world
relating to fraud,

31:46.631 --> 31:48.967
money laundering,
and tax evasion.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.404
For example, this document
shows how in 2021,

31:53.772 --> 31:55.507
four members of
the Houston family

31:55.540 --> 31:58.410
and their friends enjoyed
a three day luxury retreat

31:58.443 --> 32:01.947
in Cancun, Mexico, using
$150,000 of church money.

32:04.482 --> 32:06.651
And these documents
show former leader

32:06.685 --> 32:09.421
Brian Houston treating
private jets like Ubers,

32:09.454 --> 32:10.422
again, all with church money.

32:11.690 --> 32:13.758
Hillsong followers
believed that the money

32:13.792 --> 32:16.394
they put in the poorbox
goes to the poor,

32:16.428 --> 32:17.929
but these documents show how

32:17.963 --> 32:21.099
that money is actually used
to do the kind of shopping

32:21.132 --> 32:23.034
that would embarrass
a Kardashian,

32:23.068 --> 32:26.404
for example, a six and a half
thousand dollar Cartier watch

32:26.438 --> 32:27.939
for Bobbie Houston, two
and a half thousand dollars

32:27.973 --> 32:29.441
in Louis Vuitton luggage,

32:30.976 --> 32:33.044
a two and a half thousand
dollar watch for Phil Dooley,

32:33.078 --> 32:36.581
two watches worth $15,000
for Joel and Julia A'Bell,

32:36.615 --> 32:40.452
and even $16,000 for
custom skateboards.

32:41.853 --> 32:43.922
And then there's the cash gifts,

32:43.955 --> 32:46.925
up to $30,000 to board
members, some of whom

32:46.958 --> 32:50.816
allegedly helped cover up
the sexual abuse carried out

32:50.849 --> 32:52.785
by Frank Houston,
Brian Houston's father.

32:54.253 --> 32:56.555
There's also the curious
payments of $10,000 each

32:57.723 --> 32:58.891
to pastors who
investigated allegations

32:58.924 --> 33:02.995
of Brian Houston's
2019 sexual misconduct

33:03.028 --> 33:05.664
in a Sydney hotel room
involving a female parishioner,

33:07.900 --> 33:11.870
the documents also revealing
Hillsong earns $80 million more

33:11.904 --> 33:14.173
in Australian annual income
than it reports publicly.

33:15.741 --> 33:17.976
I verified that these
documents are genuine,

33:18.010 --> 33:20.879
and am shocked that when
offered to the ATO, ASIC,

33:20.913 --> 33:23.182
and ACNC last year under
whistleblower legislation,

33:23.215 --> 33:25.217
not one of those agencies acted,

33:26.919 --> 33:28.220
and that is a failure of
regulatory oversight every bit

33:28.253 --> 33:31.123
as alarming as
Hillsong's criminality.

33:31.156 --> 33:32.724
Thank you, Deputy Speaker.

33:33.325 --> 33:37.329
(slow piano music continues)

33:37.362 --> 33:39.998
- I want to start
by saying I'm sorry.

33:40.032 --> 33:42.701
I'm sorry that as your pastor,
you have to go through this,

33:44.036 --> 33:46.038
and your kids have
to go through this.

33:46.071 --> 33:48.607
It kind of feels like
being king hit from behind.

33:50.909 --> 33:53.178
But Jesus loves you, Mr. Wilkie.

33:55.247 --> 33:58.984
(congregation applauding)

33:59.017 --> 34:02.287
(slow piano music continues)

34:02.321 --> 34:03.989
- Here in the States,

34:04.022 --> 34:06.125
the popularity of Hillsong has
sort of fallen off a cliff.

34:07.893 --> 34:10.062
Is there something similar
happening where you are,

34:10.095 --> 34:11.697
or is it still sort
of going strong?

34:12.498 --> 34:16.168
- Tithes and donations
have dropped 20%

34:16.201 --> 34:17.669
on this time last year.

34:19.037 --> 34:20.839
The money is the
lifeline of Hillsong,

34:20.873 --> 34:23.709
and it was a really serious
revelation, I think,

34:23.742 --> 34:24.977
for donors to Hillsong to learn

34:25.010 --> 34:27.012
that there had been
secret payments

34:28.347 --> 34:29.314
of their money,
basically, right?

34:29.348 --> 34:31.683
"So I give to the church,

34:31.717 --> 34:34.686
and my money ends up secretly
being given to a victim."

34:34.720 --> 34:36.855
Even if the payouts
were small amounts,

34:36.889 --> 34:38.657
I think it really
undermined that trust.

34:40.192 --> 34:42.227
- [Alex] The more we learn
about Brian's behavior

34:42.261 --> 34:43.829
as a leader and
as a human being,

34:45.697 --> 34:48.000
the more incoherent his
handling of Carl felt.

34:49.168 --> 34:53.005
(slow piano music continues)

35:01.180 --> 35:04.283
(gently chiming music)

35:10.022 --> 35:13.992
(gently chiming music continues)

35:17.062 --> 35:21.733
- I ended up in Florida because
Florida is so off the radar.

35:22.734 --> 35:23.902
It's been quiet, it's been slow.

35:27.272 --> 35:30.242
I don't know exactly how
to label what I'm good at,

35:30.275 --> 35:32.744
but advertising, you know?

35:32.778 --> 35:35.647
That was a pretty
easy little carryover

35:35.681 --> 35:39.118
because I've been
advertising the gospel

35:39.151 --> 35:42.287
for quite a while. (laughs)

35:42.321 --> 35:46.625
(gently chiming music continues)

35:46.658 --> 35:50.028
(light switch clicks)

35:50.062 --> 35:53.132
(footsteps pattering)

35:59.004 --> 36:01.807
(footsteps continue pattering)

36:01.840 --> 36:04.042
This is it, this is my spot.

36:07.780 --> 36:09.648
It's my spot and I love it.

36:09.681 --> 36:12.017
Obviously from time to time
people will recognize you,

36:12.050 --> 36:14.987
and there was a guy, (laughs)
we were in a meeting,

36:15.020 --> 36:17.990
and after the meeting, my boss
noticed he kept looking over,

36:18.023 --> 36:20.025
and he's like, "Yeah, that
is Carl, he's with us now."

36:20.058 --> 36:21.693
And so he comes
down and he's like,

36:21.727 --> 36:23.595
"Man, it's really
great to see you."

36:23.629 --> 36:26.064
He's like, "How
does it feel to go

36:26.098 --> 36:30.969
from so high to, like,
so, so low?" (laughs)

36:32.704 --> 36:33.238
And I was like, "Well,
when you put it like that,

36:33.272 --> 36:35.140
it doesn't feel great."

36:35.174 --> 36:36.341
- When they first
started doing this-

36:36.375 --> 36:38.677
- I get it, I get
what it looks like.

36:38.710 --> 36:41.046
This actually isn't, it's
not like a better or worse

36:41.079 --> 36:42.648
or a high or a low, you know?

36:44.183 --> 36:45.951
It's just a different,
it's a different setting.

36:49.655 --> 36:52.658
Really soon after
a lot of the stuff

36:52.691 --> 36:54.960
that, you know, was
going on in the media,

36:54.993 --> 36:59.598
even in the middle of that
storm, I went to a rehab.

36:59.631 --> 37:00.599
- [Reporter] Carl
Lentz has checked

37:00.632 --> 37:03.035
into an outpatient
facility that specializes

37:03.068 --> 37:07.005
in depression, anxiety,
and pastoral burnout.

37:07.039 --> 37:09.308
(slow music)

37:09.341 --> 37:13.712
- In there, I began
the layer peel back

37:13.745 --> 37:16.882
of how you end up in the
spot that I ended up.

37:16.915 --> 37:18.117
(group chattering)

37:18.150 --> 37:22.187
It took me this awful
rock bottom moment

37:22.221 --> 37:25.691
to peel back what sexual abuse
does to somebody's brain,

37:27.059 --> 37:30.295
in regards to how I handle
sex, how I handle truth,

37:30.329 --> 37:33.799
how I handle defense systems,
how I handle control,

37:33.832 --> 37:35.601
and for a long time,

37:35.634 --> 37:37.803
it kind of dominated my
life without me knowing.

37:42.374 --> 37:45.244
I found out at that rehab center

37:45.277 --> 37:49.681
that I was a mess
inside, I was a mess.

37:49.715 --> 37:51.950
I've learned a lot
about what church can be

37:51.984 --> 37:53.051
in recovery rooms.

37:55.320 --> 37:58.323
Unfortunately, sometimes
in our Christian community,

37:58.357 --> 38:01.960
we have just neglected,
you know, logic,

38:01.994 --> 38:05.864
neglected science, neglected
therapy, neglected help.

38:07.366 --> 38:09.735
Christianity would say, "You've
got a problem with lust."

38:11.069 --> 38:11.970
You know, you go to a
rehab, my therapist says,

38:12.004 --> 38:13.639
"Can you stop using that word?

38:13.672 --> 38:15.741
You know, you were a child,

38:15.774 --> 38:18.677
and you were forced
to do these things,

38:18.710 --> 38:21.046
and now you have some issues
that you need to work through,

38:21.079 --> 38:24.583
but let's save the lust stuff
for your Christian summer camp

38:24.616 --> 38:26.118
and let's talk about your
brain chemistry for a second."

38:26.151 --> 38:28.654
And is lust a thing,
of course it is,

38:28.687 --> 38:31.824
but my point is,
I went to a rehab,

38:31.857 --> 38:36.595
and we prayed, we talked
about God, but then we went in

38:36.628 --> 38:40.365
and talked about the stuff
that prayer in and of itself

38:40.399 --> 38:43.702
and talking about Jesus
is not going to fix.

38:43.735 --> 38:47.873
My actions are my fault,
what I've done is my fault.

38:47.906 --> 38:51.376
But where that thing started,
I had no control over.

38:51.410 --> 38:52.611
I was a kid, and.

38:54.213 --> 38:57.282
(slow music continues)

39:03.055 --> 39:04.823
(slow music continues)

39:04.857 --> 39:06.992
The stuff that's
happening with Brian now,

39:07.025 --> 39:08.794
like, this is tough for me,
I'll be honest with you.

39:08.827 --> 39:10.295
It's really, really hard.

39:10.329 --> 39:12.231
Some of it's frustrating,
yeah, because the stuff

39:12.264 --> 39:15.367
that he looked at me with
the finger, and how could,

39:15.400 --> 39:17.870
you know, "This
is what you did."

39:17.903 --> 39:19.671
You know, if there's one
person who is not qualified

39:19.705 --> 39:21.874
to talk about the
state of another person

39:21.907 --> 39:24.042
in this situation,
it would be Brian.

39:25.077 --> 39:27.880
(slow music continues)

39:27.913 --> 39:30.015
But I hate to see what's
happening right now.

39:33.318 --> 39:36.054
- Hillsong founder Brian
Houston is back in Australia

39:36.088 --> 39:37.956
to face allegations he concealed

39:37.990 --> 39:40.125
his father's child sex abuse.

39:40.159 --> 39:42.939
Nine News was
there as he emerged

39:42.973 --> 39:47.444
from quarantine just days
before his first trip to court.

39:47.477 --> 39:48.779
(slow orchestral music)

39:48.812 --> 39:50.814
- [Reporter] Brian
Houston back in Sydney,

39:50.847 --> 39:53.350
the holiday well and truly over.

39:58.321 --> 39:59.956
- [Speaker] Brian comes
home and really starts

39:59.990 --> 40:02.359
what I call a non-apology tour,

40:02.392 --> 40:03.593
doing everything in his power

40:03.627 --> 40:06.229
to resurrect his brand
outside of Hillsong.

40:06.263 --> 40:09.433
- Well, hi there, I
pray you're doing well.

40:09.466 --> 40:10.967
I want to be clear,

40:11.001 --> 40:14.571
the media and others
incorrectly say I resigned

40:14.604 --> 40:16.873
because I breached the
Hillsong code of conduct,

40:16.907 --> 40:19.409
but that's just not true.

40:19.443 --> 40:22.245
I didn't resign
because of my mistakes,

40:22.279 --> 40:24.314
I resigned because
of the announcements

40:24.347 --> 40:26.683
and statements
that have been made

40:26.717 --> 40:30.420
which Bobbie and I felt
made my position untenable,

40:30.454 --> 40:32.489
and I spelled out my reasons-

40:32.522 --> 40:33.890
- [Speaker] Not only
does he not apologize,

40:33.924 --> 40:36.426
he goes fully on the defensive.

40:36.460 --> 40:39.429
- The narrative that I'm
an alcoholic is false.

40:39.463 --> 40:41.965
In fact, I've been told
by an expert therapist

40:41.998 --> 40:44.601
that I do not
display the behaviors

40:44.634 --> 40:46.770
that are typical
of an alcoholic.

40:46.803 --> 40:50.674
And the notorious night in 2019

40:50.707 --> 40:53.343
where I mixed a double dose
of anti-anxiety tablets

40:53.377 --> 40:56.680
with alcohol was a
one-off occasion.

40:57.581 --> 40:58.949
(Brian laughs)

40:58.982 --> 41:00.450
It's great to be here,
and you know what,

41:00.484 --> 41:01.918
I love this church, and-

41:01.952 --> 41:05.989
- Brian is trying to maintain
a tenuous juggling act.

41:06.022 --> 41:07.457
On the one hand,

41:07.491 --> 41:09.393
he faces this really
serious charge in court.

41:09.426 --> 41:13.563
- Alleged concealment of
alleged child sex offenses.

41:13.597 --> 41:15.465
- But on the other hand,

41:15.499 --> 41:17.667
he's trying to rehabilitate
himself as a preacher.

41:17.701 --> 41:20.470
- We've had a big
challenge with seats

41:20.504 --> 41:23.573
because some unhinged

41:23.607 --> 41:28.445
and childish people kept
reserving fake seats.

41:29.946 --> 41:32.416
People are harder on
people than God is, by far.

41:34.284 --> 41:36.920
Cancel culture
will write you off,

41:36.953 --> 41:39.289
but God won't write you off.

41:39.322 --> 41:42.325
- [Speaker] After
Brian was forced out,

41:42.359 --> 41:44.227
he'd started to go
against Hillsong.

41:44.261 --> 41:46.430
He decried the way he
was forced to resign

41:46.463 --> 41:48.331
and how Bobbie was terminated.

41:48.365 --> 41:49.966
They pivoted to a new strategy

41:50.000 --> 41:52.269
and painted
themselves as victims.

41:53.437 --> 41:57.841
- I think the hardest part to
understand for Bobbie and I,

41:57.874 --> 42:00.410
and the most difficult
part, Bobbie's termination.

42:03.980 --> 42:06.583
- When Bobbie got fired,
they all were very shocked.

42:06.616 --> 42:11.321
I'm like, "You just did
the exact same thing to me.

42:12.322 --> 42:13.490
This is your church, like,

42:13.523 --> 42:15.926
this is what you built
and your culture."

42:15.959 --> 42:18.328
Like, I don't know what
else they expected.

42:20.330 --> 42:22.566
- I've been humbled, but
I'm not living fallen

42:22.599 --> 42:24.634
and I'm not living disgraced.

42:24.668 --> 42:28.972
I'm living as a child of God
with my head held high, chosen,

42:29.005 --> 42:33.844
called, graced, and with a
God-given future and hope.

42:38.749 --> 42:41.785
(slow somber music)

42:41.818 --> 42:43.787
- [Reporter] Today Hillsong
founder Brian Houston appeared

42:43.820 --> 42:45.756
in court to begin his defense.

42:48.792 --> 42:51.561
- If he is found guilty, it
could be up to five years jail.

42:54.598 --> 42:55.932
I had a lot of people asking,

42:55.966 --> 42:57.934
am I going to be attending
his court hearing?

42:58.869 --> 42:59.970
And I thought, what
a great opportunity

43:00.003 --> 43:01.838
to try and track every day.

43:01.872 --> 43:04.241
It just made sense for me
to see this to the end.

43:05.375 --> 43:06.410
(traffic roars)

43:06.443 --> 43:07.210
Jake Elliot here.

43:08.545 --> 43:12.215
I'm outside Downing Centre
for the court hearing.

43:13.617 --> 43:15.285
I'll keep you posted.

43:15.318 --> 43:15.986
- [Speaker] Loyalties
have shifted

43:16.019 --> 43:17.621
since the royal commission days.

43:17.654 --> 43:19.589
Brian all of a sudden
finds himself alone.

43:20.991 --> 43:22.592
- [Jake] I was quite surprised

43:22.626 --> 43:25.262
to see Brian without
bodyguards or his elders.

43:26.830 --> 43:28.732
His wife was there, one of
his daughters was there.

43:29.900 --> 43:30.934
It was the Houston tribe.

43:33.403 --> 43:35.238
- [Interviewer] So what
was the defense's argument?

43:36.540 --> 43:38.842
- Essentially it was,
well, Brian didn't know,

43:38.875 --> 43:41.278
and anyone could've
reported it to police.

43:42.479 --> 43:45.916
- Brian is not the
only one, you know,

43:45.949 --> 43:48.251
half a dozen of the
top Pentecostal people

43:48.285 --> 43:51.455
in Australia also knew,

43:51.488 --> 43:55.592
and at least two very
senior Hillsong people

43:55.625 --> 43:56.793
that we know of.

43:56.827 --> 43:59.663
So this court case
involving Brian

44:00.731 --> 44:02.733
might not be the last.

44:04.935 --> 44:07.270
- It's almost like
the tide going out

44:07.304 --> 44:09.306
and seeing which fish
were gonna get caught.

44:11.808 --> 44:15.445
Brian actually said
Hazel, his mother,

44:15.479 --> 44:17.180
knew about Brett Sengstock.

44:19.282 --> 44:22.351
You could hear a pin drop.

44:22.385 --> 44:24.187
(slow music)

44:24.220 --> 44:24.954
She knew.

44:27.657 --> 44:32.270
I actually felt sick hearing
that 'cause a lot of people

44:32.304 --> 44:36.074
in Hillsong have such a high
regard for Hazel Houston.

44:36.108 --> 44:38.977
She was such a bedrock
in the early days.

44:40.145 --> 44:43.014
I actually was upset for Brian.

44:44.683 --> 44:46.384
I was upset to see how he had

44:46.418 --> 44:48.653
to speak of his mother that way.

44:51.323 --> 44:54.226
- I feel a great sadness.

44:54.259 --> 44:56.962
I feel a great maybe
moral responsibility.

44:56.995 --> 44:59.064
But in terms of feeling like,

45:01.199 --> 45:03.635
you know, that I somehow
am personally responsible

45:03.668 --> 45:06.204
or even that our church
is ultimately responsible,

45:06.238 --> 45:08.073
I don't feel.

45:08.106 --> 45:10.909
The morality of it's a different
issue than the legal issue.

45:12.144 --> 45:13.278
I don't for one moment think

45:13.311 --> 45:16.648
that my pain is
anywhere near the level

45:16.681 --> 45:19.918
of the person who was
abused by my father,

45:20.819 --> 45:23.455
and I've only got
great, great sadness

45:23.488 --> 45:26.491
about what my own personal
father did to him.

45:26.525 --> 45:29.461
- [Interviewer] What was Brett
Sengstock's testimony like?

45:30.729 --> 45:32.931
- It was actually really
hard to sit through.

45:34.065 --> 45:37.469
It was incredibly hard watching
the defense really starting

45:37.502 --> 45:41.339
to go after his memory,
it was remarkable

45:41.373 --> 45:43.875
for someone like Brett
Sengstock to hold his ground.

45:45.477 --> 45:47.646
So the trial hasn't
yet finished.

45:47.679 --> 45:51.016
It's recommencing 2023, June.

45:51.049 --> 45:53.618
I'm gonna do everything
in my power to be there.

45:53.652 --> 45:58.523
(camera shutters snapping)
(slow music continues)

46:02.360 --> 46:05.130
(slow piano music)

46:06.665 --> 46:09.468
- When I think
about the friendship

46:09.501 --> 46:12.104
that we've had with
Brian and Bobbie,

46:12.137 --> 46:14.539
the great times that
we've had being connected

46:14.573 --> 46:19.444
to Hillsong all those years,
it's just a sense of sadness,

46:22.714 --> 46:24.549
particularly the way
Laura was treated.

46:27.052 --> 46:30.922
She lost friends, she
lost position, she lost

46:32.090 --> 46:32.991
everything.

46:37.028 --> 46:39.631
- The journal starts
November 21st, which is

46:42.200 --> 46:43.168
2020.

46:44.369 --> 46:45.904
It's funny to look back at it.

46:47.606 --> 46:49.040
"Everyone knowing my personal,

46:49.074 --> 46:51.376
painful story is
the toughest part.

46:51.410 --> 46:53.145
It makes me angry.

46:53.178 --> 46:55.280
I'm hurt by my husband for
putting us in this position,

46:55.313 --> 46:56.548
and hurt by Hillsong.

46:56.581 --> 46:59.217
I've sacrificed a
lot for the church.

46:59.251 --> 47:01.319
So yeah, I'm mad at God.

47:01.353 --> 47:03.388
I deserve to be loved,
cherished, appreciated,

47:03.422 --> 47:05.390
and cared for, and he
changed our story."

47:06.324 --> 47:08.994
(slow music)

47:13.565 --> 47:15.434
- [Roman] I dare you to eat it.

47:15.467 --> 47:16.268
- To eat what?

47:16.301 --> 47:17.669
- I'm hungry.

47:17.702 --> 47:19.337
- Can you let, we're
gonna take that outside.

47:19.371 --> 47:22.874
(slow music continues)

47:26.344 --> 47:27.379
Ava, you take that.

47:27.412 --> 47:28.580
- [Ava] Where does this go?

47:28.613 --> 47:29.948
- Out on the back.

47:29.981 --> 47:31.950
Out on the table.
- Get to work, Roman.

47:31.983 --> 47:34.920
(group chattering)

47:34.953 --> 47:37.656
- [Roman] I didn't
even spill it!

47:37.689 --> 47:39.658
- It's been a grieving for me.

47:39.691 --> 47:42.127
Carl made some
really bad choices

47:42.160 --> 47:46.131
and made some really bad
decisions along the way.

47:49.367 --> 47:53.371
I've done a lot of work on
myself independent of him to be

47:55.207 --> 47:57.042
a strong woman.

47:57.075 --> 47:59.444
I don't need him and
I don't need to stay.

48:01.179 --> 48:03.949
(group chattering)

48:05.317 --> 48:07.319
But I love him and
I love my family.

48:07.352 --> 48:09.287
I love my kids,

48:09.321 --> 48:10.489
(slow piano music)

48:10.522 --> 48:12.124
and I love what
we're building now.

48:14.192 --> 48:16.962
(group chattering)

48:18.497 --> 48:20.332
- Okay, I'll do it, we're
good, we're good, we're good.

48:20.365 --> 48:21.666
- Why did you stay?

48:22.734 --> 48:23.969
I think that's
the question a lot

48:24.002 --> 48:26.638
of people have wanted to ask me.

48:26.671 --> 48:27.806
When my kids asked
me that, I said,

48:27.839 --> 48:32.411
"Because I see your dad
trying and I see him changing,

48:32.444 --> 48:34.012
and if I didn't see that,

48:34.045 --> 48:36.982
and when I don't see
that, I would leave."

48:38.216 --> 48:39.951
- And one day I was
like, "Hey, babe,

48:39.985 --> 48:42.187
can you do something
with these books?"

48:42.220 --> 48:43.989
Because, like, everywhere
in our room, like,

48:44.022 --> 48:45.557
I'll go get my socks,
there'll be one of her books,

48:45.590 --> 48:48.026
like, "What to Do After
You've Been Betrayed."

48:48.059 --> 48:49.394
And then I'll go to brush
my teeth, it's like,

48:49.428 --> 48:51.530
"How to Know if He's Cheating."

48:51.563 --> 48:53.398
And I'll go, like,
to go to my closet,

48:53.432 --> 48:55.167
and one of her other
books would drop,

48:55.200 --> 48:57.269
like, "What to Do When Your
Husband's a Piece of Shit."

48:57.302 --> 48:59.137
And I'm like,

48:59.171 --> 49:00.105
"Babe, can you do something
about these books?"

49:00.138 --> 49:03.108
She's like, "No, they're
gonna be everywhere."

49:03.141 --> 49:04.676
(Laura laughs)

49:04.709 --> 49:05.577
(group chattering)

49:05.610 --> 49:08.413
(slow piano music)

49:08.447 --> 49:10.115
- Should we pray?

49:10.148 --> 49:12.384
(group laughs)

49:12.417 --> 49:13.251
- Jesus, bless this food.

49:13.285 --> 49:14.286
- Amen.

49:14.319 --> 49:15.654
- [Group] Amen.

49:15.687 --> 49:17.389
(slow piano music continues)
(group chattering)

49:17.422 --> 49:20.292
- Me and Laura are a work in
progress, but we're still here.

49:21.526 --> 49:22.627
(group laughs)
(group chattering)

49:22.661 --> 49:24.062
Do you have a
feeling that this has

49:24.096 --> 49:25.597
obviously affected your
relationship with God?

49:25.630 --> 49:28.133
- Probably more, like-

49:28.166 --> 49:29.701
- Drawing closer to a degree-
- Yeah.

49:29.734 --> 49:31.136
- Yeah.

49:31.169 --> 49:33.605
- I think it, like,
negatively affected me,

49:33.638 --> 49:36.341
because all the people
that were, like,

49:36.374 --> 49:40.345
hating on me on my Instagram
who claim to be, like,

49:40.378 --> 49:43.215
Christian and, like,
children of God and stuff.

49:43.248 --> 49:46.551
- Sometimes if you
get a bad messenger,

49:46.585 --> 49:48.286
it affects the way you hear.

49:48.320 --> 49:49.621
- To stand in church and

49:52.390 --> 49:55.293
figure that part out is,

49:55.327 --> 49:58.230
is a lot, but I have
to feel what I feel,

49:58.263 --> 50:00.532
and I have to go
through that process.

50:00.565 --> 50:02.000
- [Ava] So is it-

50:02.033 --> 50:02.968
- [Carl] When did you
realize in this journey

50:03.001 --> 50:04.002
that you married the right guy?

50:04.035 --> 50:06.638
(group laughs)

50:06.671 --> 50:08.206
- [Ava] Are we at
a dark humor point?

50:08.240 --> 50:10.041
- [Carl] We might be
a dark humor family.

50:10.075 --> 50:11.042
- I think we might be.

50:12.611 --> 50:14.479
- I need four people in my life,

50:14.513 --> 50:16.314
and they all share my
last name. (laughs)

50:16.348 --> 50:18.383
That's the truth,
that's my circle.

50:18.417 --> 50:20.452
That's who I'm focused on.

50:20.485 --> 50:22.621
Those are the people
that matter, and I
have them every day.

50:24.489 --> 50:27.959
So yeah, that was in
jeopardy for a while, and so

50:30.028 --> 50:32.998
I understand why some
people would've walked away

50:33.031 --> 50:34.299
from what happened with me.

50:35.567 --> 50:37.335
I'm just super grateful
for those that didn't,

50:37.369 --> 50:41.373
and I'm super grateful that
my circle of five is intact.

50:43.175 --> 50:46.278
(slow music continues)

50:52.484 --> 50:55.487
(slow music)

50:55.520 --> 50:59.157
- I think Carl has
paid for what he did.

50:59.191 --> 51:02.360
In terms of healing for his
congregants, for his flock,

51:04.196 --> 51:08.633
there are thousands of people
that he just sort of left.

51:10.602 --> 51:14.039
- I posted this on
Instagram in April of 2021.

51:14.072 --> 51:16.007
"This church really
needs to change,"

51:16.041 --> 51:18.210
and I put like 20
exclamation points,

51:18.243 --> 51:20.145
but I could've done, like, 40.

51:20.178 --> 51:24.116
"In fact, it needs to be
taken down and rebuilt

51:24.149 --> 51:28.019
on a true, not Brian
Houston, Jesus foundation.

51:29.554 --> 51:33.391
Brian Charles Houston created
and grew the culture Carl

51:33.425 --> 51:35.460
and others were nurtured in.

51:35.494 --> 51:37.629
So what do you expect
is gonna come out of it?

51:37.662 --> 51:40.198
You plant things in rotten soil,

51:40.232 --> 51:42.634
then you're going to have
rotten fruit," I'm sorry.

51:42.667 --> 51:43.602
- Mm-hmm.

51:43.635 --> 51:47.206
- The reason I'm doing this is

51:47.239 --> 51:50.142
because I want to see
one of two things happen.

51:50.175 --> 51:54.446
I want to see change, or I
want to see Hillsong shut down.

51:58.283 --> 52:01.754
I loved Carl, and I didn't have
a problem so much with Carl.

52:01.787 --> 52:03.222
I didn't know a whole lot

52:03.255 --> 52:05.224
about what was going
on in Carl's life.

52:05.257 --> 52:07.459
My problem was with
Hillsong, period.

52:07.493 --> 52:09.528
Hillsong is the last church

52:09.561 --> 52:12.898
that I will ever go to
this side of Heaven.

52:17.736 --> 52:20.673
- I don't consider myself
a Christian anymore.

52:22.508 --> 52:27.279
I don't know the answers to
the deeper questions in life,

52:27.313 --> 52:30.582
and it's not so existentially
terrifying to me anymore.

52:30.616 --> 52:34.753
I actually find peace in just
being like, "I don't know."

52:39.358 --> 52:42.161
- Once I got further and
further away from the church,

52:42.761 --> 52:44.563
I just found out for myself

52:44.596 --> 52:46.165
that I don't think
any of it's real,

52:46.198 --> 52:47.666
and it's beautiful if
people believe in it,

52:47.700 --> 52:51.704
but for me, it's not me.

52:51.737 --> 52:53.872
I'm a really happy atheist.

52:55.774 --> 52:56.675
- It's been

52:58.610 --> 53:02.414
four years now since
I stepped in a church.

53:04.183 --> 53:06.418
There was no way that
I was gonna continue

53:06.452 --> 53:10.856
to betray myself, people
deserve better than that.

53:10.889 --> 53:14.593
People deserve to have
an actual community.

53:17.262 --> 53:20.132
- Failing people on
a mass scale is hard.

53:22.501 --> 53:27.139
I let down, genuinely,
a lot of good people,

53:27.172 --> 53:31.276
and I can only
apologize and change.

53:33.612 --> 53:35.914
My story is now one of recovery,

53:35.948 --> 53:38.317
and it hasn't been
without failure.

53:38.350 --> 53:41.420
You know, it's not like
we're on this road,

53:41.453 --> 53:43.155
and all of a sudden, you know,

53:43.188 --> 53:45.357
we're magically, our
family's perfect, I'm good.

53:48.661 --> 53:51.230
So it's a pretty humbling
road to be on every day.

53:55.768 --> 53:58.470
(slow music)

53:58.504 --> 54:00.673
- When your church sort
of turns inside out

54:00.706 --> 54:02.207
and you see how
much it was built

54:02.241 --> 54:04.610
around the benefit
of an individual,

54:04.643 --> 54:07.379
rather than this quote
unquote mission and vision

54:07.413 --> 54:09.715
that you'd signed
yourself up for, yeah,

54:09.748 --> 54:11.617
the disillusionment's
incredibly painful.

54:15.321 --> 54:17.456
- Church is very triggering
for me right now.

54:21.593 --> 54:23.862
I'm getting better,
I still can't sing.

54:25.331 --> 54:27.266
I don't think I've
said a word in church

54:27.299 --> 54:28.867
in a year and a half.

54:31.270 --> 54:33.339
And I know God knows
my heart, (laughs)

54:33.372 --> 54:37.423
and he knows where I'm at,
and I know it's a process.

54:39.459 --> 54:42.095
And it makes me sad (cries)

54:43.696 --> 54:46.866
because I love
the church, I love

54:49.669 --> 54:51.671
what I was a part of.

54:51.704 --> 54:56.409
But I see a lot of unhealthiness
in church life as well now

54:56.442 --> 54:58.044
'cause I'm out of it,

54:59.178 --> 55:02.115
things that I didn't realize
were unhealthy or, like,

55:05.284 --> 55:09.589
manipulative, and I don't
think that's God's heart,

55:09.622 --> 55:13.259
and I don't think that's what
Christianity's supposed to be.

55:17.397 --> 55:21.000
- For any Evangelical community,

55:21.033 --> 55:25.905
there needs to be a re-centering
on the heart of the faith

55:26.773 --> 55:30.343
over and against
strategy and metrics

55:30.376 --> 55:34.614
and success (laughs)
and the numbers game.

55:36.015 --> 55:37.450
- What if you took a year,

55:37.483 --> 55:40.286
and instead of counting
attendance on Sundays,

55:40.319 --> 55:42.955
instead of counting conversions,

55:42.989 --> 55:45.925
measure success based on
how the church is showing up

55:45.958 --> 55:48.594
in times of real
crisis, crisis of life,

55:48.628 --> 55:50.596
crisis of loss,
crisis of suffering.

55:53.166 --> 55:55.968
I think if the church
wants to look at, like,

55:57.103 --> 56:00.440
how do we avoid the pain of
this stuff in the future,

56:00.473 --> 56:04.277
really look to why people
thought the church mattered.

56:04.310 --> 56:06.379
(slow piano music)

56:06.412 --> 56:08.281
- Your family's
supposed to, you know,

56:08.314 --> 56:11.150
give your kids their guidance

56:11.184 --> 56:12.452
and where they're
supposed to go,

56:12.485 --> 56:14.353
and church is just a bonus,

56:14.387 --> 56:17.523
and I feel like we have
that twisted a little bit.

56:17.557 --> 56:20.159
You have to be at every
service every Sunday,

56:20.193 --> 56:23.996
otherwise, you know, your
life could fall apart.

56:24.030 --> 56:26.599
I just disagree with
that kind of mentality,

56:28.367 --> 56:31.504
and I think there's more to
church than just a building.

56:31.537 --> 56:35.174
Now, more than ever,
I really see that.

56:35.208 --> 56:38.444
(slow piano music continues)

56:38.478 --> 56:40.613
- My spirituality today,

56:40.646 --> 56:42.281
it's very much a
personal thing now.

56:42.315 --> 56:45.351
It's not connected
to formal church.

56:46.652 --> 56:48.588
It's not connected to a place.

56:48.621 --> 56:53.259
It's not connected to
anything in particular,

56:54.360 --> 56:55.595
other than myself.

56:55.628 --> 57:00.099
(slow piano music continues)

57:00.133 --> 57:04.437
- So when I left Hillsong,
I went to a small church.

57:04.470 --> 57:07.039
It didn't have all
the fancy stuff,

57:07.940 --> 57:11.611
but it did have the
unconditional love

57:11.644 --> 57:15.515
that I'd always been looking
for and hoping I'd find,

57:15.548 --> 57:17.350
and I found it there.

57:19.552 --> 57:23.923
And that really feels
like what Jesus was about,

57:23.956 --> 57:27.493
being open and
loving to everyone.

57:27.527 --> 57:31.130
(slow piano music continues)

57:35.068 --> 57:37.303
- Hillsong can't become
a healthy organization.

57:38.638 --> 57:41.007
It's a system of abuse,
and without that system,

57:41.040 --> 57:44.911
it's not Hillsong,
it's a regular church.

57:44.944 --> 57:49.449
It can't have the levels of
success and reach that it has

57:49.482 --> 57:54.320
if it's gonna treat people
properly, keep children safe,

57:55.488 --> 57:57.957
pay staff appropriately,
have equality.

58:00.626 --> 58:02.662
You know, you can't
turn the Manson Family

58:02.695 --> 58:03.930
into "The Brady Bunch."

58:08.634 --> 58:10.436
- The reason I've spoken up is

58:11.471 --> 58:13.039
because I saw what it did to me.

58:13.072 --> 58:15.007
I've seen what it
did to my family,

58:15.608 --> 58:19.045
and if there is somebody else

58:19.078 --> 58:21.681
who might have been abused by
Frank who, maybe who knew me,

58:21.714 --> 58:25.485
maybe who knew me, then
they would talk to me.

58:29.122 --> 58:32.058
- For those that Frank
Houston preyed on,

58:32.091 --> 58:33.960
a recognition of what
they've been through,

58:33.993 --> 58:35.661
I think, is really important.

58:35.695 --> 58:37.597
They've carried this
their entire lives.

58:39.532 --> 58:42.502
It's a stone thrown into a pond,
but the ripples never stop.

58:42.535 --> 58:43.436
There is no healing there.

58:44.537 --> 58:47.173
Brian Houston has the influence

58:49.175 --> 58:54.013
to create a space where some
sort of truth can be found,

58:55.148 --> 58:56.983
and I don't think
he's done that.

58:59.619 --> 59:00.920
(slow piano music)

59:00.953 --> 59:02.121
- Whatever happens
with Hillsong,

59:02.155 --> 59:04.090
whatever happens
with Brian Houston,

59:04.123 --> 59:05.658
they have provided a template

59:05.691 --> 59:07.460
for churches all
around the world,

59:07.493 --> 59:10.596
for charismatic
Christians to exploit

59:10.630 --> 59:13.132
and to convert their
personal charisma

59:13.166 --> 59:16.102
into financial acquisitions.

59:16.135 --> 59:17.970
That doesn't end
with Brian Houston.

59:21.107 --> 59:24.343
- [Speaker] I think that
what Hillsong has shown is

59:25.978 --> 59:28.614
the model is scalable
and profitable.

59:28.648 --> 59:31.651
You can do it everywhere,
and people will eat it up.

59:33.986 --> 59:37.256
The megachurch construct
is forever going

59:37.290 --> 59:42.028
to be part of our lives.
(slow piano music continues)

59:44.630 --> 59:47.266
- This whole contemporary
Christian culture,

59:47.300 --> 59:49.335
it needs to be
dismantled in some way

59:49.368 --> 59:50.870
and reborn as something else.

59:54.307 --> 59:57.076
A church is people, a
church is community.

59:57.110 --> 01:00:00.146
The church should be people
caring about each other,

01:00:00.179 --> 01:00:02.515
and that honestly doesn't
have to have anything
