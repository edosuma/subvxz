03:17.989 --> 03:20.033
You cannot decide to be a great chef.

03:20.116 --> 03:22.160
You either have talent or you don't.

03:30.084 --> 03:31.920
<i>When the dishes come,</i>

03:32.003 --> 03:34.672
<i>you eat them with your eyes.</i>

03:36.466 --> 03:38.343
There's a lot of emotion in her food.

10:15.990 --> 10:19.910
<i>She really takes care</i>
<i>with the ingredients she uses.</i>

10:19.994 --> 10:26.042
She always says, talking about the famous
saying, "Chefs are rock stars."

10:26.125 --> 10:29.629
She always says,
"No, the producers are the rock stars!"

13:40.486 --> 13:42.738
<i>She uses a lot of seafood,</i>

13:42.821 --> 13:45.824
and that's a part
of her Brittany memories.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.494
But I don't think her country is France

13:48.577 --> 13:50.371
or the United States.

13:50.454 --> 13:53.582
I think that her country is San Francisco.

25:52.425 --> 25:55.762
What is surprising
is her sauces and her bouillons.

25:55.845 --> 25:58.765
It's there that we can see
her French side.

26:02.269 --> 26:05.438
<i>I have to say that making sauces</i>
<i>is expensive,</i>

26:05.522 --> 26:07.816
<i>making sauces takes a lot of time.</i>

26:08.733 --> 26:13.738
<i>However for us, the French,</i>
<i>sauces are like the DNA of our cuisine.</i>

33:13.908 --> 33:15.034
Hey, Mom!

33:16.202 --> 33:17.203
Is everything okay?

33:21.249 --> 33:23.960
Oh, my sweet mom!
Are things going well?

33:24.043 --> 33:26.254
-Yes! Perfect!
-You? Yes, very good.

33:26.337 --> 33:27.338
Ready to go?

33:27.422 --> 33:33.177
I'm starving. Let's go get some breakfast
and some coffee, okay?

33:33.261 --> 33:34.262
-For sure!
-Okay.

33:34.345 --> 33:36.264
Please mind the step.
How have you been? Everything okay?

33:36.347 --> 33:37.348
Yes.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.058
-How about your health?
-Yes.

33:39.142 --> 33:41.352
-Has your health been improving lately?
-Yes.

34:56.511 --> 34:58.471
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

34:58.554 --> 35:00.389
Dominique Crenn.
This is where I lived.

35:00.473 --> 35:02.600
-The kid.
-Yes.

35:02.683 --> 35:04.435
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, Noella.

35:04.519 --> 35:07.188
I bet this will
bring back some memories, right?

35:08.356 --> 35:10.316
When you were little,
were you playing here?

35:10.399 --> 35:13.569
Well, no.
My dad used to do his painting here.

35:13.653 --> 35:14.821
Yes.

35:14.904 --> 35:18.616
Here we had bikes.
My dad used to paint here, too,

35:18.699 --> 35:23.579
like he did upstairs,
in the front room.

35:23.663 --> 35:25.039
Have you changed them a little bit?

35:25.123 --> 35:26.749
-The rooms? No.
-Wow.

35:26.833 --> 35:30.086
Oh, yeah, there it is...
It was converted into an office.

35:30.169 --> 35:32.463
-Yes, a home office.
-Yes.

35:34.549 --> 35:36.592
I can see this is a building
that you know well.

35:36.676 --> 35:38.553
Did you play here when you were young?

35:38.636 --> 35:43.141
Yes, we played here.
We would hide here.

35:46.853 --> 35:48.604
My room.

36:29.604 --> 36:31.981
-This was your parents' bedroom.
-Yes, I know.

36:32.064 --> 36:34.734
This is where I saw my father
for the last time.
