01:02.886 --> 01:06.265
If he has time to play that,
he has time to take a rest.

01:08.273 --> 01:09.742
He won‘t.

01:10.346 --> 01:13.715
Nothing like the English Suites
to douse the flames in your head.

01:13.749 --> 01:17.335
No fire analogies, please, Miss Bach.

01:45.199 --> 01:47.218
Rossino.

03:37.849 --> 03:39.778
You know that‘s bad for them.

03:43.529 --> 03:45.588
It'll cheer them up.

03:45.761 --> 03:48.638
Paddling around all day with
no direction.

03:49.339 --> 03:52.428
With no idea what might be coming up
from the dark to get them.

03:54.449 --> 03:56.838
And crisps will solve that?

03:57.591 --> 03:59.468
You‘re not English.

04:03.415 --> 04:06.324
I couldn't come until I was sure you
weren't being watched.

04:08.018 --> 04:09.662
That‘s all right.

04:10.818 --> 04:13.347
I'm a woman.
I'm used to men pissing me about.

04:24.404 --> 04:25.939
How is he?

04:27.948 --> 04:29.777
Michel?

04:30.868 --> 04:33.397
Haven‘t seen anything on the
news about a trial, so...

04:33.971 --> 04:36.728
where is he being sentenced?
Germany or Israel?

04:38.659 --> 04:41.041
He‘s getting the fairest trial he can.

04:45.175 --> 04:47.004
You need to be calm.

04:48.361 --> 04:50.790
When they make contact,
don't seem too eager.

04:50.965 --> 04:52.998
They‘ll treasure most
what they cannot have.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.250
Will they?

05:00.838 --> 05:02.847
Where have you been?

05:05.049 --> 05:07.895
I keep on thinking I‘m seeing you.

05:09.158 --> 05:11.077
Everywhere.

05:13.489 --> 05:16.059
And if I'm being totally honest,
I th...

05:18.179 --> 05:20.988
I think it‘s all starting
to mess with my head a bit.

05:29.244 --> 05:31.453
We‘ll take care of all that
when it‘s over.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.784
And you‘ll be there?

06:03.088 --> 06:06.314
Come on. I need to give you the
final part of the fiction.

06:11.058 --> 06:14.487
You‘re here with Michel on your
last morning together.

06:15.006 --> 06:16.895
He woke you early, drove you out.

06:16.952 --> 06:19.061
Fumble in the car first?

06:21.163 --> 06:23.012
Please concentrate, Charlie.

06:23.809 --> 06:25.628
This is just outside Munich.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.063
I do have to get back.

06:29.336 --> 06:31.725
Tonight's the last night of our tour.

06:41.949 --> 06:45.978
For the first time... here... now...

06:46.373 --> 06:50.452
I mention to you my brother, Khalil.

06:51.866 --> 06:56.082
His very existence is a secret I
share with only the most loyal few.

06:59.939 --> 07:02.301
For years I worked on the fringes,

07:03.550 --> 07:05.476
trying to impress my brother.

07:07.822 --> 07:09.931
I saw him seldom.

07:10.261 --> 07:13.870
A day in Damascus,
a few hours in Amman.

07:14.719 --> 07:18.793
One night I was by his side,
with my sister, Fatmeh.

07:19.359 --> 07:24.328
We were drinking in his words,
his wisdom, his courage.

07:24.436 --> 07:27.558
We were walking down the street
when suddenly he stopped...

07:28.772 --> 07:30.931
..and he embraced me.

07:31.126 --> 07:33.745
I could feel his rough face
against my own.

07:34.889 --> 07:37.138
He could feel my tears.

07:38.768 --> 07:40.787
He took this from his left pocket...

07:44.249 --> 07:46.588
...and he put it into my hand.

07:52.596 --> 07:54.228
It's heavy.

07:54.428 --> 07:56.497
That was my response.

08:11.019 --> 08:13.813
Khalil was shot in his right
wrist as a boy.

08:14.442 --> 08:16.257
He taught himself to fire with one hand

08:16.282 --> 08:18.451
so that he could continue
fighting another day.

08:20.172 --> 08:22.181
We must all be strong like him.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.551
Which one shall I hit first?

08:30.382 --> 08:32.351
Your choice.

08:35.909 --> 08:37.410
Wait.

08:39.856 --> 08:41.018
Fire.

08:44.617 --> 08:47.197
Fire.

08:52.349 --> 08:55.252
Well, it would have been a miracle
if you hit anything.

08:55.782 --> 08:57.118
What?

08:57.326 --> 08:59.707
Shooting with one hand is not easy-

09:02.068 --> 09:03.348
Now kiss it.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.549
- What?
- The gun.

09:08.569 --> 09:12.062
Charlie, you must swear allegiance...

09:12.712 --> 09:15.129
- ...as I did.
- It's a bit kinky,

09:15.154 --> 09:17.269
- don't you think?
- Fuck your sarcasm!

09:20.212 --> 09:21.162
Do you know how the Zionists

09:21.187 --> 09:23.935
described my country
when they first arrived?

09:26.222 --> 09:29.351
"A land without a people,
for a people without a land."

09:32.144 --> 09:34.723
Their genocide was already committed.

09:35.810 --> 09:37.919
What happened then in '48?

09:39.139 --> 09:40.597
In Deir Yassin?

09:41.780 --> 09:45.381
Their Irgun soldiers made barrel
bombs filled with petrol

09:45.781 --> 09:47.800
and rolled them down the hill...

09:48.682 --> 09:51.211
...so they would set fire
to our villagers.

09:51.346 --> 09:53.219
They cut off the hands of our men.

09:54.396 --> 09:56.287
They raped our women.

09:57.311 --> 09:59.320
They blinded our children.

10:03.083 --> 10:05.152
And then in '67...

10:07.097 --> 10:09.166
...they did the same thing again...

10:10.272 --> 10:11.577
...and again...

10:13.525 --> 10:14.724
and again.

10:34.161 --> 10:36.460
I have something better than a gun.

10:46.822 --> 10:49.301
I‘m a spy, not a thief.

10:50.476 --> 10:52.607
I've built in a wiretap.

10:53.446 --> 10:55.651
We‘ll be listening whenever
you‘re in our reach.

10:55.779 --> 10:58.811
- How is that better than a gun?
- It's company.

11:02.980 --> 11:04.735
You know acting?

11:07.140 --> 11:09.939
Well, the only way I know
how to do it properly...

11:11.730 --> 11:14.209
...is to live it.

11:14.654 --> 11:17.143
So it becomes the truth for me.

11:19.372 --> 11:21.276
So, if I love Michel...

11:23.732 --> 11:25.531
...I have to really love him.

11:28.457 --> 11:29.981
Completely.

11:32.636 --> 11:36.441
Put on a white scarf
and I will come for you.

11:37.207 --> 11:39.811
Otherwise,
we‘ll be listening on that radio.

11:49.489 --> 11:51.558
I'll remember that
when I go to the loo, then.

11:51.632 --> 11:56.025
I wanted to raise a toast to,
erm, our little friend here...

11:56.050 --> 11:57.650
- What?
- ...by going down the pub,

11:57.675 --> 11:58.818
- and sinking...
- Ah.

11:58.846 --> 11:59.986
- Ah, the pub,
- Hey.

12:00.011 --> 12:01.897
- nigh on 50 pints.
- What a novel idea!

12:03.341 --> 12:05.297
- What you having?
- I'm not.

12:05.322 --> 12:06.581
What do you mean?

12:06.780 --> 12:08.881
I'm not... I'm not going to come
and join you guys.

12:09.133 --> 12:10.941
- Not just now.
- Why not?

12:11.109 --> 12:14.522
- I‘m just going to head back for a bit.
- It was our last show!

12:14.547 --> 12:17.367
- I know!
- It's just a half hour walk.

12:17.392 --> 12:18.552
- That's all.
- Where have you gone, Chaz?

12:18.576 --> 12:20.555
Nowhere. I'll catch you later.

12:21.027 --> 12:22.444
Pour me a pint.

12:23.832 --> 12:26.601
I'll, erm, stay with Chaz too,
I'll meet you.

12:26.816 --> 12:28.033
All right, then.

12:28.058 --> 12:29.783
- Borings!
- For God's sake.

12:29.808 --> 12:31.205
Come on.

12:36.848 --> 12:39.237
- We bore you, don't we?
- What?

12:39.314 --> 12:40.865
It's OK. It's fine.

12:41.611 --> 12:42.965
Wherever your head is,

12:43.159 --> 12:46.414
that was the best I've seen you
today, Chaz, ever.

12:49.855 --> 12:52.540
I feel like I could
be anyone, right now.

12:53.372 --> 12:56.394
"Your spirits are too bold
for your years."

13:02.882 --> 13:04.698
- Have fun, go catch up with them.
- OK.

13:04.729 --> 13:07.638
It'll take me ages to find out
which one‘s mine.

13:07.663 --> 13:09.822
They all look the same.

13:09.859 --> 13:11.436
Cool, see you. Bye.

13:41.872 --> 13:44.301
Shit. Shit!

13:52.150 --> 13:54.549
Urgh! Come on!

13:55.775 --> 13:57.570
Erm, they've, they‘ve been here.

13:57.642 --> 14:00.608
They've been here and
they‘ve left a note.

14:02.528 --> 14:04.060
Oh, God.

14:04.085 --> 14:05.774
Erm, it says...

14:05.799 --> 14:07.108
It says, "M would be..."

14:07.467 --> 14:09.149
M... "M" must be Michel, right?

14:09.174 --> 14:10.472
"M would be proud of you."

14:10.497 --> 14:12.756
"Michel would be proud of you."

14:35.842 --> 14:37.679
"Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit."

14:37.912 --> 14:39.939
That is not the reaction
we were expecting.

14:39.964 --> 14:43.006
- Who are you?
- Who did you think I was?

14:43.812 --> 14:46.921
Some creep. stalks me after my shows.

14:47.291 --> 14:49.400
Sends his men to watch out for me.

14:50.605 --> 14:52.804
Well, I haven't seen any men.

14:53.121 --> 14:54.558
Why would you have?

14:55.452 --> 14:57.543
I‘m charged with the responsibility

14:57.568 --> 14:59.137
of representing the giver of this gift

14:59.162 --> 15:00.269
legally, Miss Charlie.

15:02.861 --> 15:04.930
That is the vodka you drink with him?

15:05.818 --> 15:07.013
Yes?

15:07.138 --> 15:10.615
With grapes in your hotels.

15:11.712 --> 15:13.172
He would be very glad to know

15:13.197 --> 15:16.279
that Rosalind was wearing
his bracelet today.

15:17.488 --> 15:19.737
And is wearing it still, I think.

15:21.058 --> 15:24.893
- Please, if you will come with me.
- I‘m not going anywhere.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.489
He is very angry

15:31.514 --> 15:33.803
when his hospitality is
refused, Miss Charlie.

15:38.606 --> 15:40.287
I have news of him.

15:42.883 --> 15:45.642
M told me to trust no-one.

15:46.492 --> 15:49.379
- Do you know M's real name?
- Of course.

15:49.447 --> 15:51.606
It ends with an M, in fact.

15:53.743 --> 15:55.842
Can you trust me now?

16:29.318 --> 16:30.748
A gun.

16:31.064 --> 16:33.123
Could be a chair.

16:33.889 --> 16:36.818
- Sit over there.
- See?

17:04.840 --> 17:06.709
You said you had news.

17:07.319 --> 17:09.377
- About Michel?
- Charlie.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.637
So good to finally meet you.

17:11.848 --> 17:14.150
- My name is Helga.
- Helga?

17:14.858 --> 17:17.131
When did you last see him, please?

17:17.792 --> 17:20.743
- In Munich.
- That is where.

17:21.044 --> 17:24.328
- Not when.
- Anton is a lawyer.

17:24.818 --> 17:26.871
Near... nearly three weeks ago.

17:27.267 --> 17:29.246
That was the last time
I heard from him.

17:30.257 --> 17:33.509
This does not need to be a long
interrogation.

17:33.575 --> 17:36.428
- Lie to me again...
- I'm not lying! I'm not lying!

17:36.623 --> 17:38.678
- Three weeks?
- Yes.

17:38.983 --> 17:41.261
- Yeah.
- I thought you were in love.

17:45.707 --> 17:46.999
"Were"?

17:51.051 --> 17:54.000
Has something happened to him?

17:59.259 --> 18:02.348
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Oh. yes.

18:02.453 --> 18:04.230
Super dead.

18:14.396 --> 18:15.857
We‘ve lost them.

18:19.670 --> 18:21.282
We are sorry.

18:21.339 --> 18:25.295
Judging from your beautiful
letters, you will be sorry, too.

18:25.339 --> 18:28.128
The letters are fake,
Anton, just like this performance.

18:28.311 --> 18:30.330
Look at her.

18:32.459 --> 18:35.638
- Oh, no.
- A girl died also.

18:35.739 --> 18:38.830
Swedish, really sexy.

18:39.646 --> 18:41.895
How does that make you feel?

18:45.888 --> 18:47.370
Bastards.

18:48.736 --> 18:51.189
Lying Zionist bastards...

18:51.350 --> 18:53.562
- Leave it.
- Zionists?

18:53.991 --> 18:55.540
They‘re cowards.

18:56.278 --> 18:57.956
They‘re cowards, all of them.

18:58.122 --> 19:00.701
You said "Zionists" Charlie,
"lying", Why?

19:00.759 --> 19:02.456
- Well, who else killed him?
- Killed him?

19:02.481 --> 19:04.038
Read the newspaper!

19:04.239 --> 19:05.918
The police say it was an accident.

19:05.943 --> 19:08.310
It's very dangerous to contradict
the police, Charlie.

19:08.335 --> 19:11.277
Why would my client drive
a car full of explosives,

19:11.302 --> 19:14.021
- Oh, shut up, will you?
- when he was a student?

19:16.621 --> 19:19.132
_

19:19.609 --> 19:22.508
Bloody meter. What's wrong
with this country?

19:24.939 --> 19:26.122
_

19:26.499 --> 19:28.048
Anton!

19:31.344 --> 19:32.394
_

19:35.729 --> 19:39.707
Charlie. Do you maybe have 50p?

19:40.860 --> 19:42.449
Please?

19:49.329 --> 19:51.338
Thank you.

20:16.139 --> 20:17.549
I knew it.

20:17.975 --> 20:20.384
I knew it! It's to .it... for music!

20:20.862 --> 20:21.901
For music,

20:21.926 --> 20:23.313
Don't you have music in your
revolution?

20:23.338 --> 20:24.853
The door, the windows at the back.

20:24.878 --> 20:26.269
Come on!

20:28.743 --> 20:30.171
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, w-...

20:30.223 --> 20:31.793
Wait for my signal.

20:32.811 --> 20:34.622
_

20:36.222 --> 20:38.128
I'll show you she's a police whore.

20:38.279 --> 20:39.757
There's... there's...

20:39.782 --> 20:41.804
There‘s no reception!
There‘s no reception!

20:41.829 --> 20:43.260
This place is a shithole!

20:43.312 --> 20:45.433
Ah! Argh!

20:46.138 --> 20:49.340
I knew you were a fake
the minute I saw you.

20:49.518 --> 20:50.868
_

20:52.192 --> 20:55.241
- How can I believe you?
- Because I kissed his gun!

21:03.367 --> 21:05.516
I kissed his brother's gun.

21:10.099 --> 21:12.634
Michel didn‘t have a brother.

21:13.594 --> 21:15.613
Sure he didn't.

21:17.270 --> 21:20.549
I said, "This is a bit kinky,"...

21:21.444 --> 21:23.998
...and he said "Fuck your sarcasm."

21:25.723 --> 21:27.485
So then I kissed his gun.

21:36.196 --> 21:37.925
Khalil's.

21:47.265 --> 21:49.758
Please. Please.

21:50.864 --> 21:52.923
What else did he say to you?

21:53.780 --> 21:55.116
Facts.

21:55.836 --> 21:58.129
Tell us everything you know.

22:04.120 --> 22:05.441
No.

22:06.015 --> 22:08.219
How do I know you‘re not
the police whore?

22:10.394 --> 22:11.644
Sit down!

22:21.246 --> 22:24.147
Where does he find you crazy bitches?

22:27.905 --> 22:30.258
Welcome to the revolution, Charlie.

22:34.510 --> 22:35.800
Get back.

23:19.498 --> 23:20.998
You killed him.

23:24.665 --> 23:26.125
Why didn‘t you tell me?

23:26.254 --> 23:29.051
- We needed a genuine performance.
- Ha-ha!

23:30.269 --> 23:31.998
Right. OK.

23:32.139 --> 23:34.137
Now you don't trust my acting skills.

23:34.209 --> 23:35.781
This is reality.

23:36.499 --> 23:38.754
If they‘d have seen you were false
for a fraction of a second

23:38.779 --> 23:40.171
they would have killed you.

23:40.391 --> 23:41.945
They‘re the murderers?

23:44.393 --> 23:49.111
You'd let me die in a heartbeat,
wouldn't you?

23:49.331 --> 23:51.466
Just like that Swedish girl.

23:51.983 --> 23:53.812
Just to get to them.

23:56.209 --> 23:58.344
They will verify your story now.

23:58.909 --> 24:00.672
Report upwards.

24:01.909 --> 24:03.804
You‘re in this fight.

24:04.008 --> 24:05.014
Whether you like it or not.

24:05.039 --> 24:06.226
The thing is, I don't know what side

24:06.251 --> 24:07.693
I ought to fight for anymore.

24:07.732 --> 24:10.031
Good. Genuine.

24:12.980 --> 24:14.637
Show me one thing.

24:15.333 --> 24:17.482
One real thing about you.

24:42.129 --> 24:44.039
Take credit, Gadi.

24:44.149 --> 24:46.323
It's better than we even dreamed.

24:46.811 --> 24:48.838
They've taken the hook. Helga Stern,

24:48.863 --> 24:50.852
our radical pastor‘s daughter.

24:51.047 --> 24:53.614
Rossino, the motorcycling hack.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.478
And now this new player.

24:56.549 --> 24:58.873
- Anton.
- A lawyer, no less.

24:58.936 --> 25:01.184
What kind of accent did
this Anton have?

25:01.261 --> 25:04.348
- German.
- Or Swiss perhaps?

25:04.515 --> 25:06.983
The law firm Michel wrote to
was in Zurich.

25:07.044 --> 25:08.684
I'll check their books for an Anton.

25:08.745 --> 25:11.293
Their books, his passport,
his birth certificate.

25:11.318 --> 25:15.396
I want everything there is
on this dashing legal burgher.

25:19.790 --> 25:21.213
Gadi.

25:33.528 --> 25:35.818
Is she still in the game?

25:36.256 --> 25:40.032
- She took it hard.
- That‘s why they believe her.

25:41.269 --> 25:43.568
All we know is she's still in play.

25:45.919 --> 25:47.978
You have doubts?

25:50.646 --> 25:52.587
- Where will they take her?
- We don't know.

25:52.619 --> 25:54.206
That is the point.

25:54.638 --> 25:57.191
Call it now, Gadi.

25:57.519 --> 25:59.274
Right now.

25:59.647 --> 26:02.818
Do we let it play or do we
pull her out?

26:03.318 --> 26:05.897
She doesn‘t realise
how far this will go.

26:06.602 --> 26:10.071
Her survival depends on her ignorance.

26:10.570 --> 26:12.339
You know that.

26:12.881 --> 26:16.193
A girl like Charlie comes along
once in a lifetime.

26:16.416 --> 26:17.768
That heart.

26:18.130 --> 26:19.978
That unfocussed rage.

26:20.023 --> 26:23.627
That demands faith now, not direction.

26:36.404 --> 26:38.563
Now, as you awaken.

26:38.693 --> 26:40.852
Remember the swan‘s last dance.

26:41.878 --> 26:44.930
Did you dance with young angels
While you were dreaming?

26:45.569 --> 26:47.498
Did the butterfly light you up.

26:47.610 --> 26:50.617
When it burned with the eternal
light of the rose?

26:51.645 --> 26:54.323
Did the phoenix appear clearly
before you.

26:54.384 --> 26:56.248
And call you by your name?

26:56.859 --> 26:59.968
Tell me how you lived your dream
in a certain place.

27:00.718 --> 27:02.984
And I'll tell you who you are.

27:03.357 --> 27:05.253
And now, as you awaken, remember

27:05.484 --> 27:07.948
if you have wronged your dream.

27:08.181 --> 27:09.678
And if you have,

27:10.137 --> 27:12.502
then remember I the
last dance of the swan.

27:14.173 --> 27:16.829
As for me, I like to be loved as I am.

27:17.057 --> 27:19.171
Not as a colour photo in the paper.

27:19.282 --> 27:22.572
Or as an idea composed
in a poem amid the stags

27:22.734 --> 27:25.557
I hear Laila's faraway scream
from the bedroom.

27:25.671 --> 27:28.359
Do not leave me a prisoner of rhyme
in the tribal nights.

27:28.422 --> 27:30.111
Do not leave me to them as news

27:30.439 --> 27:33.694
I am a woman, no more and no less...

27:34.376 --> 27:36.295
You may rob me of the
last span of my land.

27:37.014 --> 27:38.968
You may ditch my youth
in prison holes...

27:43.232 --> 27:44.560
We‘ve got him!

27:46.784 --> 27:48.948
One Anton Mesterbein.

27:49.156 --> 27:52.207
A lawyer affiliated with Birchler
and Associates in Zurich.

27:52.262 --> 27:54.203
He does pro-bono work for

27:54.228 --> 27:57.579
radical students, third
worlders, guest workers...

27:57.668 --> 28:00.572
And gun-slinging revolutionaries

28:00.597 --> 28:03.233
who have a weakness
for quaint cottages.

28:04.211 --> 28:05.465
So...

28:06.758 --> 28:10.912
what else does he get up
to in his spare time?

28:11.486 --> 28:12.920
He‘s quite the traveller.

28:13.626 --> 28:16.312
France, Egypt, Turkey, Spain...

28:16.337 --> 28:19.931
Turkey... Michel bought
semtex out of Istanbul.

28:22.398 --> 28:24.727
Ah, back from the dead, Shimon?

28:25.259 --> 28:28.360
We should look into any numbered
accounts he's using.

28:32.206 --> 28:34.225
- Cheers.
- Thank you, darling.

28:37.701 --> 28:40.230
Next stop, Chalk Farm.

28:43.542 --> 28:46.390
Hey! What are you doing?

28:46.468 --> 28:48.817
Did he just take something?

28:50.119 --> 28:51.903
No, no, no.

28:56.142 --> 28:58.578
"Here's my number in case of emergency."

28:58.751 --> 29:00.868
"Only call if you are far from home."

29:00.991 --> 29:03.200
"Missing you, Helga."

29:15.893 --> 29:17.938
Our best, best girl.

29:18.016 --> 29:20.355
You deserve an Oscar, Charlie.

29:21.975 --> 29:23.315
Stop it.

29:29.655 --> 29:31.904
You had the white scarf.

29:33.219 --> 29:34.409
Well?

29:35.186 --> 29:36.873
They use postcards to communicate.

29:39.229 --> 29:40.968
To communicate what?

29:43.092 --> 29:47.761
Your performance in the cabin
convinced the first and

29:47.786 --> 29:50.017
steeliest of your critics.

29:50.042 --> 29:52.721
Your new pals Helga and Anton.

29:53.007 --> 29:58.910
And now you are invited
to the bigger show.

30:00.715 --> 30:02.945
Want to listen back to yourself?
You were captivating...

30:02.970 --> 30:04.406
I said stop.

30:14.435 --> 30:16.046
Very well.

30:21.601 --> 30:25.868
You have opened up a whole new can
of worms for us, Charlie.

30:25.959 --> 30:30.406
Worms we have been trying to hook
for many years now.

30:31.659 --> 30:36.484
And whatever happens from here,
we are forever in your debt.

30:39.752 --> 30:41.092
Trying to recruit me again, Mart?

30:41.117 --> 30:43.247
I am telling you we need you.

30:45.070 --> 30:48.899
OK, so what does happen next?

30:49.399 --> 30:51.210
Hasn‘t our friend said?

30:51.240 --> 30:54.931
Gadi doesn‘t say a bloody thing,
not unless you tell him to.

30:54.956 --> 30:56.137
Gadi.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.194
Hmm.

30:59.305 --> 31:04.576
Honestly Charlie, we don't
know what happens next.

31:06.179 --> 31:12.110
In this situation,
we are like ducks, if I may,

31:12.135 --> 31:13.884
on the surface of a pond.

31:14.114 --> 31:17.755
Now, so far you have stayed above
the murkiest patches,

31:17.827 --> 31:19.263
paddling away brilliantly,

31:19.288 --> 31:23.520
allowing us to see whoever it is
who comes up to say hello.

31:24.604 --> 31:27.338
But, from here on in,

31:27.648 --> 31:31.958
we need you to dive under the water.

31:32.899 --> 31:35.847
- Deep.
- So I'm bait.

31:37.349 --> 31:39.748
Why would I want to go any deeper?

31:39.908 --> 31:41.056
I have a gun to my head

31:41.081 --> 31:42.435
while you just sit around listening,

31:42.460 --> 31:44.045
jotting names down?

31:46.054 --> 31:47.678
Where will you be?

31:48.195 --> 31:50.874
As close by as we can.

31:52.467 --> 31:54.868
You have to play it with instinct,
with courage...

31:54.893 --> 31:57.791
I don't have to do a bloody thing!

32:00.185 --> 32:03.884
When you showed me that boy
in Munich, Michel.

32:04.554 --> 32:07.273
Did you know you were
going to murder him?

32:09.197 --> 32:10.731
Did you?

32:10.850 --> 32:12.539
Yes.

32:13.603 --> 32:15.432
I did.

32:23.529 --> 32:24.868
And did you?

32:25.079 --> 32:26.338
No.

32:26.393 --> 32:28.132
He didn't.

32:35.929 --> 32:37.290
Goodbye.

32:47.689 --> 32:49.271
Do something.

33:17.280 --> 33:19.389
What happens if I don't do this?

33:19.541 --> 33:21.221
He‘ll keep coming.

33:23.810 --> 33:27.122
Our military‘s just waiting for an
attack big enough.

33:27.562 --> 33:29.858
Then they can blow them all up.

33:30.447 --> 33:32.627
And Khalil will only get stronger.

33:38.229 --> 33:41.228
Are you going to kill him like
you killed Michel?

33:42.032 --> 33:43.874
No, we need Khalil alive.

33:51.644 --> 33:53.223
Where are we going?

33:54.331 --> 33:56.307
We‘ve passed the same
place three times.

34:45.737 --> 34:47.081
Shh.

35:04.539 --> 35:06.508
I‘m sorry, Charlie.

35:14.093 --> 35:15.543
You don't need to whisper.

35:18.056 --> 35:19.700
I‘m really sorry.

35:20.463 --> 35:21.843
For all of it.

35:45.358 --> 35:46.886
So, this is you?

35:50.408 --> 35:52.013
Yeah, this is me.

35:52.925 --> 35:54.558
For now.

36:02.856 --> 36:05.784
- My name is Gadi Becker.
- No cover stories.

36:07.609 --> 36:10.938
OK? No apologies. No lies.

36:11.060 --> 36:13.520
And if this is part of the service,
then don't.

36:16.214 --> 36:17.692
I am a soldier.

36:19.323 --> 36:21.201
I have fought in many wars.

36:23.912 --> 36:25.601
I have killed.

36:29.879 --> 36:31.853
I've used people and I've lied.

36:37.971 --> 36:39.494
I was married once...

36:42.249 --> 36:44.258
...but our love wasn't strong enough.

38:21.150 --> 38:22.794
How did you pick up these?

38:24.934 --> 38:29.725
A fire... in a tank... ‘67.

38:32.041 --> 38:34.670
- And this one?
- A bullet.

38:38.961 --> 38:40.435
What are you doing?

38:40.545 --> 38:41.785
- Stay there!
- Ha-ha! What?

38:41.810 --> 38:43.008
Don't move-

38:46.225 --> 38:47.637
What about this one?

38:47.835 --> 38:49.994
- I can't see.
- That one.

38:50.656 --> 38:53.848
- Erm, shrapnel.
- Of course.

38:55.626 --> 38:58.015
- And this one?
- Stab wound.

38:58.146 --> 39:00.579
Ha! Thug.

39:02.079 --> 39:03.541
Aah! Sorry, sorry, sorry!

39:03.566 --> 39:05.030
- Sorry. sorry!
- It's hot.

39:05.055 --> 39:06.341
I know, it's really hot under here.

39:12.986 --> 39:15.005
What about this one?

39:17.349 --> 39:19.163
My mother‘s Pomeranian.

39:20.904 --> 39:23.138
- What?
- Yeah, when I was five.

39:24.876 --> 39:27.861
- He was a little shit.
- Mm.

39:41.465 --> 39:43.682
I thought you disapproved of me.

39:45.388 --> 39:47.198
All my men.

39:47.789 --> 39:50.138
I‘d never disapprove of pleasure.

39:53.201 --> 39:55.255
It's the only antidote to death.

39:57.339 --> 39:58.585
Thief.

40:03.967 --> 40:05.622
Was it Marty, then?

40:08.031 --> 40:10.255
Did he say you weren't allowed?

40:10.783 --> 40:12.242
To love me?

40:14.850 --> 40:17.239
Can we not bring Marty in here with us?

40:18.557 --> 40:19.757
But why?

40:30.517 --> 40:32.240
You don't have to do this.

40:34.814 --> 40:36.553
You‘re not one of us.

40:41.906 --> 40:46.651
Well... call me when she comes out,
Daniel.

41:08.065 --> 41:10.976
Here. Your old one.

41:13.245 --> 41:14.943
You'll be out of our reach.

41:34.397 --> 41:36.466
You know, I changed my mind.

41:40.912 --> 41:42.651
It's love.

41:45.276 --> 41:47.808
Love is the antidote to death.

42:13.086 --> 42:14.613
Wish me luck.

42:39.665 --> 42:41.444
- Hello.
- Helga.

42:44.420 --> 42:46.248
You walk down the stairs,

42:46.316 --> 42:48.884
then you go down to
the end of the path,

42:49.023 --> 42:50.963
right past the phone box.

42:51.456 --> 42:54.255
Then you turn and come back again.

42:57.151 --> 43:00.543
The call will come
exactly at two, Charlie.

43:01.226 --> 43:02.666
Don't be late.

43:36.513 --> 43:39.475
- Excuse me, I'm expecting a call...
- Here's what you do.

43:39.558 --> 43:42.295
You walk on my left side to the car.
Hands behind your back.

43:42.409 --> 43:45.551
If you call out,
I shoot you on the right side, here.

43:45.862 --> 43:48.757
If the police show up,
if I‘m suspicious...

43:49.229 --> 43:50.566
Boom!

44:07.540 --> 44:08.728
All right!

44:16.690 --> 44:18.306
Very good, Charlie.

44:18.636 --> 44:20.195
Strap on her seat belt.

44:22.667 --> 44:24.944
Turn round, and I'll shoot you, OK?

44:26.924 --> 44:28.753
Good girl.

44:32.509 --> 44:34.147
Where are you taking me?

44:35.552 --> 44:37.833
- Where did they take her?
- Heathrow.

44:37.872 --> 44:39.496
They boarded a flight
to Charles de Gaulle.

44:39.521 --> 44:42.024
- They?
- Charlie and Helga.

44:42.319 --> 44:43.958
We have confirmation from
the ticket desk.

44:44.014 --> 44:45.070
And?

44:45.095 --> 44:47.198
And she hasn't passed
through French customs.

44:47.277 --> 44:48.667
Plane landed hours ago.

44:48.736 --> 44:50.817
- We've lost her?
- No.

44:51.483 --> 44:53.414
They've found her.

44:53.884 --> 44:55.790
And they like what they see.

45:15.112 --> 45:18.544
This is absolutely your last chance
to tell me the truth, Charlie.

45:19.085 --> 45:21.175
Who have you talked to
about you and Michel?

45:21.200 --> 45:22.698
Or what? You'll shoot me?

45:22.818 --> 45:24.671
It's not for me to shoot you now.

45:26.165 --> 45:29.517
It will be worse than that
if you are a liar.

45:32.222 --> 45:33.706
The handbag.

45:38.344 --> 45:39.793
Please.

45:41.765 --> 45:43.820
They will find everything out.

45:49.131 --> 45:52.040
I'm telling you this because
I like you, actually.

45:52.982 --> 45:55.231
Funny way of showing it.

45:57.659 --> 45:58.956
Yalla!

46:09.369 --> 46:10.664
Lebanon?

46:10.869 --> 46:13.484
Yes, a flight from Paris to Beirut.

46:13.914 --> 46:15.708
She was spotted this morning.

46:15.825 --> 46:17.226
The dream is alive, Gadi.

46:17.251 --> 46:19.599
She has crossed the line,
gone straight in.

46:19.905 --> 46:22.574
So now the fiction and reality
become one.

46:22.857 --> 46:25.436
They take her in,
fall in love with her.

46:26.577 --> 46:28.534
- l have to go out there.
- No.

46:28.619 --> 46:30.600
- Marty, l have...
- No.

46:31.575 --> 46:34.904
Give it time, as you know you should.

46:35.121 --> 46:38.636
She is safer in the fiction.

46:39.312 --> 46:40.795
They will send her back to us.

46:40.832 --> 46:42.596
As one of us, or one of them?

46:44.617 --> 46:46.071
What does it matter?

47:01.416 --> 47:04.186
- We see each other again?
- Who knows?

47:04.211 --> 47:05.934
Wait. You‘re not coming with me?

47:06.524 --> 47:09.953
Don't screw with these guys, 0K?

47:12.068 --> 47:14.014
Helga... No. No, no, no, no, no!

47:14.073 --> 47:16.372
Fuck off! No!

47:16.535 --> 47:19.311
I am Salim's woman!
Get your hands off me!

47:19.395 --> 47:21.314
What the... No, no, no, no, no!

47:21.478 --> 47:24.124
Please! No! no! Aah!

47:24.524 --> 47:26.491
Aah! Helga! Helga!

47:28.649 --> 47:30.988
We‘ve disrupted Khalil's supply chain.

47:31.830 --> 47:33.644
His brother is dead.

47:34.557 --> 47:36.864
So you think we‘ve knocked him
off-balance?

47:37.461 --> 47:41.296
He will come back harder,
more dangerous, more suspicious.

47:41.362 --> 47:44.804
- You‘re underestimating her.
- No, are underestimating them.

47:44.960 --> 47:47.209
Just like we always do.

47:52.431 --> 47:55.814
Do you think I am overshooting myself?

47:56.265 --> 48:00.711
How the hell else do you expect
me to hit the sky?

48:02.170 --> 48:07.188
No! No! No! Helga!

48:14.490 --> 48:16.500
I told her she had a choice.

48:17.137 --> 48:19.959
Then you lied, didn‘t you?

48:22.115 --> 48:23.620
Not me.

48:25.593 --> 48:27.488
You wanted autonomy.

48:27.999 --> 48:29.555
This is autonomy.

48:29.666 --> 48:32.009
- But she's not prepared.
- You should have prepared her.

48:32.076 --> 48:35.020
- I needed more time.
- You took all night.

48:38.612 --> 48:41.841
How dare you? l was losing her.

48:41.894 --> 48:47.080
Ah, but not your touch, clearly.

48:48.113 --> 48:49.953
And I am glad for it, Gadi.

48:50.036 --> 48:52.142
Come on. Bringing her
back to your flat,

48:52.167 --> 48:54.343
making her feel loved...

48:54.745 --> 48:58.672
It was you who pushed her onto that
plane, no-one else.

48:59.715 --> 49:01.886
You act as if you are so changed,

49:01.911 --> 49:06.127
but you have not lived
this much in years.

49:10.240 --> 49:12.259
Take a night off.

49:13.405 --> 49:16.874
Consider your role in this.

49:17.313 --> 49:20.658
I can see the great Gadi Becker
coming back to me.

49:21.363 --> 49:23.118
I don't want this weakness

49:23.143 --> 49:26.253
to strangle him before he can breathe.

49:27.263 --> 49:29.849
Ha-ha! Honestly,

49:29.901 --> 49:33.050
all those years hiding in Berlin.

49:34.238 --> 49:38.022
How you can prefer that graveyard
of a place to Israel

49:38.099 --> 49:40.544
is a mystery to me.

49:41.055 --> 49:43.544
Well, it‘s no mystery
to the Palestinians.

49:45.601 --> 49:47.799
If you live in exile, you
don't have to ask yourself

49:47.824 --> 49:49.184
if you‘re the bad guy.

50:50.263 --> 50:52.322
Keep it on your right wrist.

50:53.900 --> 50:55.619
Then I'll know you‘re 0K.

51:54.296 --> 51:56.942
The Palestinian people
are easy to love.

51:57.514 --> 51:59.446
They aren‘t like us.

52:00.002 --> 52:02.301
Like us? Or like you?

52:09.046 --> 52:11.908
Don't mistake chaos for incompetence.

52:12.378 --> 52:16.387
Khalil is everywhere...
always watching.

52:20.735 --> 52:22.229
Give nothing.

52:23.072 --> 52:25.091
Listen to everything.

52:41.095 --> 52:43.294
I am Captain Tayeh.

52:49.354 --> 52:50.637
Thank you.

53:06.174 --> 53:09.453
The owner of this house must not
like vodka, I'm afraid.

53:10.256 --> 53:12.275
- For you?
- No.

53:17.645 --> 53:21.811
They say you are much in love
with our dead Palestinian.

53:23.627 --> 53:25.928
Helga says you want to fight.

53:26.085 --> 53:28.844
- I do.
- Anybody, or just Zionists?

53:31.819 --> 53:33.731
Some of the people we get,

53:33.812 --> 53:36.678
they want to blow up the whole world.

53:37.615 --> 53:40.498
- Are you like that?
- No.

53:40.704 --> 53:44.444
Helga, Mr Mesterbein.

53:45.778 --> 53:47.141
Scum.

53:49.568 --> 53:53.479
Necessary scum...
but scum all the same.

53:54.991 --> 53:57.240
Is that you, Charlie?

53:58.597 --> 54:01.086
I‘d hardly say yes, would I?

54:06.346 --> 54:07.969
Ever kill anybody?

54:10.289 --> 54:11.601
No.

54:12.286 --> 54:13.810
You‘re lucky.

54:15.505 --> 54:18.047
Why do you want to kill yourself
fighting for us?

54:18.108 --> 54:21.107
- To continue what he started.
- Salim is dead.

54:24.355 --> 54:26.950
In a year or two, we shall all be dead.

54:31.049 --> 54:32.561
He taught me.

54:33.722 --> 54:36.667
To what? To bomb?

54:38.101 --> 54:40.209
To shoot? To kill?

54:40.261 --> 54:42.114
He taught me to shoot once.

54:45.347 --> 54:47.644
You want to change the world.

54:47.933 --> 54:49.261
Forget it.

54:50.107 --> 54:52.306
Your English already did that.

54:53.387 --> 54:54.980
Stay home.

54:55.955 --> 54:57.792
Act your little parts.

54:59.040 --> 55:01.709
- It's safer.
- It's death.

55:04.853 --> 55:06.266
In Munich.

55:06.597 --> 55:09.295
Why did you leave your boyfriend Salim?

55:09.799 --> 55:13.163
You'd already driven the car across
the border for him.

55:13.365 --> 55:16.174
- What did you know that he didn't?
- Nothing.

55:16.934 --> 55:19.202
He told me to come back to
avoid suspicion.

55:19.375 --> 55:20.842
- Suspicion?
- Mmm-hmm.

55:21.055 --> 55:22.212
I‘d already taken one risk,

55:22.237 --> 55:24.275
and if I did it again,
they might notice.

55:34.722 --> 55:37.928
Actually, I was relieved,
to tell you the truth.

55:39.123 --> 55:41.806
After that drive, I
saw him in the hotel,

55:42.570 --> 55:44.130
and l was scared.

55:47.780 --> 55:49.074
Sorry.

55:52.355 --> 55:54.721
How could I have known he
was going to die?

55:57.662 --> 55:59.189
Did he teach you to hate, Charlie?

55:59.214 --> 56:00.946
Hate is for Zionists.

56:00.972 --> 56:02.569
He said to fight, we must love.

56:02.594 --> 56:04.632
Yes. But we also bomb.

56:04.869 --> 56:06.999
Shoot. Kill.

56:07.337 --> 56:08.973
Did he teach you to hate, Charlie?

56:09.025 --> 56:10.346
Enough. Tayeh.

56:13.047 --> 56:14.576
You can leave now.

56:40.813 --> 56:42.822
He had a birthmark.

56:44.635 --> 56:46.442
Below his hip.

56:48.413 --> 56:50.099
Which side?

56:50.382 --> 56:51.752
- His right.
- A scar.

56:51.777 --> 56:53.606
Scars.

56:55.073 --> 56:57.998
His right shoulder,
lower back, his feet.

57:01.933 --> 57:04.039
Do you want me to tell
you about his penis too?

57:10.178 --> 57:11.728
He was good to you?

57:16.982 --> 57:19.210
What was he to you?

57:30.960 --> 57:32.304
The trigger.

57:38.699 --> 57:40.299
Welcome, Charlie.

57:47.612 --> 57:49.362
I am Fatmeh.
