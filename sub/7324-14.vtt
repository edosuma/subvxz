I'M A FLORIST.

07:15.806 --> 07:17.437
THESE ROSES WON'T LAST
IN THE OPEN AIR.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.739
THEY'RE GONNA WILT.
SIR.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.571
SIR, YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

07:20.571 --> 07:21.812
MAINTAIN
IN-LINE STABILIZATION.

07:21.812 --> 07:24.715
WE NEED TO GET TRAUMA LABS,
FILMS, AND ULTRASOUND.

07:24.715 --> 07:26.877
MAKE SURE THAT C.T.
IS AVAILABLE, AND PAGE ALTMAN.
(woman) RIGHT AWAY, DOCTOR.

07:26.877 --> 07:28.819
(machine beeps)

07:28.819 --> 07:32.182
SHE'S NOT RESPONDING TO
THE SEIZURE MEDICATION, RANDY.

07:32.182 --> 07:35.055
SHE IS IN SERIOUS DANGER OF
SUFFERING SEVERE BRAIN DAMAGE,

07:35.055 --> 07:38.188
WHICH IS WHY I'D LIKE TO PLACE
HER IN A MEDICALLY INDUCED COMA.

07:38.188 --> 07:39.730
A-A COMA?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:39.730 --> 07:41.031
BASICALLY, A DEEP SLEEP
TO PREVENT THE SEIZURES

07:41.031 --> 07:42.633
FROM DAMAGING HER BRAIN.

07:42.633 --> 07:44.064
(Meredith) IT WILL ALSO
BUY US SOME TIME

07:44.064 --> 07:45.996
SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S CAUSING THEM.

07:45.996 --> 07:47.698
SHE JUST TURNED 32.

07:47.698 --> 07:50.200
WE'VE NEVER TALKED ABOUT
MEDICAL DECISION-TYPE STUFF.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.902
WELL, EVERY SEIZURE JANELL HAS

07:51.902 --> 07:53.203
HURTS HER BRAIN
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

07:53.203 --> 07:54.745
WE NEED TO DO THIS NOW.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.910
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

07:59.910 --> 08:02.252
OH, GOD. YEAH.
PLEASE DO IT.

08:02.252 --> 08:03.614
OKAY.
DO IT, PLEASE.

08:03.614 --> 08:04.955
PUSH 150 MILLIGRAMS
OF PROPOFOL.

08:04.955 --> 08:06.857
CALL RESPIRATORY
WHILE I PREP FOR INTUBATION.

08:06.857 --> 08:09.890
(people shout indistinctly)

08:09.890 --> 08:13.063
(indistinct conversations)

08:14.965 --> 08:17.167
KEPNER, FORGET THE FLOWERS.

08:17.167 --> 08:20.500
THROW THEM OUT
AND GET BACK TO WORK.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.272
(woman) WE'VE GOT MORE PEOPLE
COMING IN.

08:22.272 --> 08:24.134
(Richard) KEPNER.
(truck horn honks)

08:24.134 --> 08:25.906
YOU'RE NOT THROWING
THOSE FLOWERS AWAY?

08:25.906 --> 08:27.207
BUT--BUT HE--

08:27.207 --> 08:28.579
HE DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW.

08:34.885 --> 08:37.517
THROWING AWAY
PERFECTLY GOOD FLOWERS.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.149
EVERYONE'S A CYNIC
THESE DAYS...
(siren wailing)

08:39.149 --> 08:41.692
TALKING ABOUT NOT BELIEVING
IN VALENTINE'S DAY.

08:41.692 --> 08:43.053
I MEAN, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH A DAY

08:43.053 --> 08:44.855
DEVOTED TO THE PERSON
YOU LOVE?

08:44.855 --> 08:47.157
I TAKE THIS DAY
VERY SERIOUSLY.

08:47.157 --> 08:50.060
I KNOW YOU DO.
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, SIR.

08:50.060 --> 08:53.003
MM. THANK YOU,
DR. GREY.

08:53.003 --> 08:54.264
I'M HEADING HOME EARLY,

08:54.264 --> 08:57.037
TRY AND SPEND MOST
OF THE DAY WITH MY WIFE.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.810
W-WHAT ABOUT YOU?
YOU HITTING THE TOWN?

08:59.810 --> 09:02.773
(chuckles) I'M NOT HITTING
MUCH OF ANYTHING THESE DAYS.

09:02.773 --> 09:04.014
(indistinct conversations
continue)

09:04.014 --> 09:05.776
OH, GOD. I'M SORRY.

09:05.776 --> 09:06.917
THAT WAS CRASS.

09:06.917 --> 09:09.980
I'M H--UH, UH, HAVE
NO VALENTINE'S PLANS.

09:09.980 --> 09:11.982
(siren whoops)
(woman) WHAT THE HELL
WAS I THINKING?

09:11.982 --> 09:13.754
I SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO MY MOM.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.056
I USED TO BE YOUNG!
I USED TO BE PRETTY!

09:16.056 --> 09:17.858
I HAVE WASTED
MY ENTIRE YOUTH ON YOU!

09:17.858 --> 09:19.890
CHARLIE BILSON, 32,
HIT BY A CAR

09:19.890 --> 09:22.132
WHEN HE RAN HEAD-ON
INTO TRAFFIC.

09:22.132 --> 09:24.935
COMPLAINS OF CHEST
AND BACK PAIN.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAPPEN!
HOW STUPID COULD I BE?

09:24.935 --> 09:26.837
HAS ABDOMINAL TENDERNESS
ON PALPATION.
HOW STUPID?!

09:26.837 --> 09:27.998
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
A BROKEN NOSE.

09:27.998 --> 09:29.069
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU DID THIS!

09:29.069 --> 09:30.801
OKAY, IF YOU HADN'T
MADE ME CHASE YOU DOWN--

09:30.801 --> 09:32.302
YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE CHASED ME.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BOTHERED,

09:32.302 --> 09:33.944
BECAUSE IT'S OVER.

09:33.944 --> 09:35.806
THIS IS OVER.
WHAT HAPPENED?

09:35.806 --> 09:37.808
WE'RE HAVING BREAKFAST IN BED.
ONE SECOND, YOU'RE SO HAPPY--

09:37.808 --> 09:40.881
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO PROPOSE!

09:40.881 --> 09:42.012
(panting)

09:42.012 --> 09:43.353
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

09:43.353 --> 09:45.355
WELL, SHE'S WHEEZING,
BUT WE'LL TREAT THAT.

09:45.355 --> 09:46.987
YOU'RE GONNA BE
JUST FINE, UH...

09:46.987 --> 09:50.160
CLEMENTINE. UH, I THINK
THE KIDS CALL HER CLEM.

09:50.160 --> 09:51.321
YOU'RE NOT THE MOM?

09:51.321 --> 09:53.023
SHE'S ON HER WAY.
SHE WAS AT THE GYM.

09:53.023 --> 09:54.995
I'M JUST THE MORON THAT BOUGHT
THE BOX OF PEANUT CLUSTERS

09:54.995 --> 09:57.327
FOR THE KID
WHO'S ALLERGIC TO NUTS.

09:57.327 --> 09:59.269
MY SON WANTED TO GIVE HER
A VALENTINE.

09:59.269 --> 10:00.901
SHE TOOK A BITE,
AND THIS HAPPENED.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.633
I'M--I'M GONNA START YOU
ON A BREATHING TREATMENT.

10:02.633 --> 10:04.104
AND THEN I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
AN I.V. WITH MEDICINE

10:04.104 --> 10:05.736
TO TREAT THE RASH, OKAY?

10:05.736 --> 10:06.937
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

10:06.937 --> 10:09.339
(continues panting)

10:09.339 --> 10:10.981
HERE.

10:10.981 --> 10:12.212
IF IT HURTS,
YOU CAN SQUEEZE MY HAND,

10:12.212 --> 10:14.184
HARD AS YOU WANT.

10:14.184 --> 10:15.916
(people speaking indistinctly)

10:15.916 --> 10:17.888
OKAY, CLEM,
HERE WE GO.

10:17.888 --> 10:19.149
READY?

10:19.149 --> 10:22.152
ONE, TWO...

10:22.152 --> 10:23.654
THREE. OKAY.

10:23.654 --> 10:25.656
GOOD.

10:25.656 --> 10:28.058
HONESTLY,
THOSE LITTLE BOXES?

10:28.058 --> 10:29.029
THEY TAUNT ME, CHARLIE.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.230
I WOULD RATHER
A NICE COFFEE TABLE BOOK

10:30.230 --> 10:31.802
OR MAYBE EVEN A MUG,

10:31.802 --> 10:33.333
BECAUSE THEN AT LEAST
I WOULDN'T GET MY HOPES UP

10:33.333 --> 10:34.865
EVERY FREAKIN' VALENTINE'S DAY

10:34.865 --> 10:36.036
WHEN YOU PULL OUT
THE LITTLE VELVET BOX.

10:36.036 --> 10:37.207
YOU DIDN'T EVEN LOOK
AT THE NECKLACE.

10:37.207 --> 10:39.069
I DIDN'T HAVE TO.
IT WASN'T A RING.

10:39.069 --> 10:41.011
(Richard) OH, THAT'S A...

10:41.011 --> 10:42.673
PRETTY NASTY CUT THERE.

10:42.673 --> 10:43.944
DR. GREY.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.116
YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK?

10:46.116 --> 10:47.217
SURE.

10:47.217 --> 10:48.879
COME WITH ME.

10:48.879 --> 10:51.251
(people speaking indistinctly)

10:51.251 --> 10:53.023
(Richard sighs)

10:53.023 --> 10:56.286
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

10:56.286 --> 10:58.028
(door closes)

10:59.990 --> 11:03.663
A MAN SHOULD GET TO BLEED
IN PEACE.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.736
THANKS.

11:05.736 --> 11:06.837
(clicks keyboard keys)

11:06.837 --> 11:07.968
(door opens)

11:07.968 --> 11:09.139
WHAT?

11:09.139 --> 11:10.841
MM.
I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

11:10.841 --> 11:12.703
WHY THIS PATIENT'S
HAVING SEIZURES

11:12.703 --> 11:14.975
WHEN I NOTICED SHE HAS
A HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA.

11:14.975 --> 11:17.147
UH, WHICH MEANS SHE'S HAVING
AN AUTOIMMUNE RESPONSE.

11:17.147 --> 11:19.750
RIGHT. IF ANTIBODIES ARE
ATTACKING HER RED BLOOD CELLS,

11:19.750 --> 11:21.812
WHO'S TO SAY THAT ANTIBODIES
COULDN'T BE ATTACKING HER BRAIN,

11:21.812 --> 11:23.113
CAUSING THE ENCEPHALITIS?

11:23.113 --> 11:24.985
OH, AND IT'S NOT A BRAIN TUMOR.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.416
THAT'S WHY YOU PAGED ME.

11:26.416 --> 11:27.958
WELL, YEAH, AND I THOUGHT
WE COULD SPEND

11:27.958 --> 11:29.259
VALENTINE'S DAY TOGETHER.

11:29.259 --> 11:31.421
UH, YOU MAY NOT HAVE
VALENTINE'S DAY PLANS,

11:31.421 --> 11:32.963
BUT I DO, GREY,

11:32.963 --> 11:34.865
PLANS THAT I AM NOT WILLING
TO FORFEIT.

11:34.865 --> 11:35.996
SO HERE'S HOW THIS
IS GOING TO GO--

11:35.996 --> 11:37.928
IN A TIMELY
AND EFFICIENT MANNER,

11:37.928 --> 11:41.001
YOU AND I WILL RULE OUT
EVERYTHING THAT COULD BE

11:41.001 --> 11:43.033
CAUSING THIS WOMAN'S BODY
TO ATTACK ITSELF,

11:43.033 --> 11:45.235
VIRUS BY VIRUS,
TUMOR BY TUMOR,

11:45.235 --> 11:47.107
UNTIL WE LAND ON
THE ONE THING--
(beeps)

11:47.107 --> 11:48.839
IT'S A TERATOMA.
WHAT?

11:48.839 --> 11:51.711
I SENT OFF JANELL'S C.S.F.
FROM HER SPINAL TAP

11:51.711 --> 11:53.183
FOR ANTI-N.M.D.A. RECEPTOR
ANTIBODIES,

11:53.183 --> 11:54.885
AND IT JUST
CAME BACK POSITIVE.

11:54.885 --> 11:56.046
SHOW OFF.

11:56.046 --> 11:58.488
LET'S GET A SCAN.

12:00.951 --> 12:04.054
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

12:04.054 --> 12:05.195
(inhales deeply)

12:05.195 --> 12:06.797
(exhales)

12:06.797 --> 12:08.128
IS THIS OUR FLOWER GUY?

12:08.128 --> 12:10.130
YEAH. HE HAS AN INTRAPERICARDIAL
DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.862
WHOA. HOW DID
HIS ABDOMINAL ORGANS

12:11.862 --> 12:13.263
GET INTO THE SAC
AROUND HIS HEART?

12:13.263 --> 12:15.065
(Cristina) UH, HIS CHEST HIT
THE WHEEL WHEN HE CRASHED.

12:15.065 --> 12:16.736
WELL, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO REDUCE THE HERNIA.

12:16.736 --> 12:17.968
BOOK AN O.R.

12:17.968 --> 12:19.239
BUMP ANY NONEMERGENT PATIENTS,

12:19.239 --> 12:22.412
AND FIND SOMEONE
TO SCRUB IN WITH ME.

12:22.412 --> 12:25.015
DR. HUNT HAS AGREED TO LET ME
BACK ON YOUR SERVICE,

12:25.015 --> 12:26.516
SO I CAN SCRUB IN
WITH YOU.

12:26.516 --> 12:27.978
REALLY?

12:27.978 --> 12:29.279
(sighs) WE NEED TO GET
IN THERE AND DO THE REPAIR

12:29.279 --> 12:30.981
BEFORE HE TAMPONADES,

12:30.981 --> 12:33.523
SO WE SHOULD MOVE
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

12:33.523 --> 12:35.856
LIKE I'M EVER
ANYTHING BUT.

12:35.856 --> 12:38.088
(wheels clatter)

12:38.088 --> 12:40.260
YOU MUST THINK
I'M SUCH A BITCH.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.132
NO.

12:42.132 --> 12:43.864
IT'S BEEN EIGHT YEARS,

12:43.864 --> 12:45.765
AND IT'S--IT'S--
EVERY VALENTINE'S DAY,

12:45.765 --> 12:47.137
THE BUILDUP GETS WORSE.

12:47.137 --> 12:49.840
THIS MORNING HE WAKES ME UP,
AND BREAKFAST IN BED,

12:49.840 --> 12:51.141
AND THEN HE TELLS ME,
HE BOOKED DINNER

12:51.141 --> 12:52.843
AND A NICE HOTEL AT THE PIER,

12:52.843 --> 12:55.445
AND THEN HE PULLS OUT
ANOTHER CHEAP ASS NECKLACE.

12:55.445 --> 12:57.147
EIGHT YEARS.

12:57.147 --> 12:58.879
WE'RE NOT EXACTLY TEENAGERS.

12:58.879 --> 13:02.012
MM. MAYBE HE DOESN'T KNOW
HOW MUCH YOU WANT IT.

13:02.012 --> 13:03.914
WE GO TO 20 WEDDINGS
A YEAR,

13:03.914 --> 13:06.256
AND I SOB LIKE A LUNATIC
AT EVERY ONE.

13:06.256 --> 13:07.217
I'M NOT THAT SENTIMENTAL.

13:07.217 --> 13:08.959
HE KNOWS.

13:08.959 --> 13:10.190
HE KNOWS.
(door opens)

13:10.190 --> 13:12.422
C.T. SHOWS EXTENSIVE
INTERNAL BLEEDING.

13:12.422 --> 13:13.894
HE'S ALSO HYPOTENSIVE.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.866
WE HAVE TO GET HIM
UP TO THE O.R. NOW.

13:15.866 --> 13:17.197
WHAT--WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

13:17.197 --> 13:19.069
WE'RE TAKING YOUR FIANCE
TO SURGERY.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.371
(clicks button)

13:21.371 --> 13:23.803
HE IS NOT HER FIANCE.

13:30.580 --> 13:33.113
(suction gurgling)

13:33.113 --> 13:35.415
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

13:35.415 --> 13:37.047
SUCTION.

13:37.047 --> 13:40.050
(suction gurgling)

13:40.050 --> 13:43.894
(beeping continues)

13:43.894 --> 13:45.055
YEAH, WATCH THE--

13:45.055 --> 13:46.356
OH, SORRY. SORRY.

13:46.356 --> 13:49.129
(beeping continues)

13:49.129 --> 13:52.362
SO ANYBODY GOT ANY GOOD
VALENTINE'S PLANS?

13:52.362 --> 13:56.166
(beeping continues)

13:56.166 --> 13:58.608
MY HUSBAND DIED

13:58.608 --> 14:00.340
IN THIS O.R. A MONTH AGO.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.112
DR. YANG PERFORMED
THE SURGERY.

14:02.112 --> 14:04.344
I WAS IN A 7-HOUR SURGERY

14:04.344 --> 14:06.446
AND DIDN'T KNOW
THAT HE HAD DIED.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.518
DR. HUNT KEPT THAT A SECRET.

14:08.518 --> 14:10.050
SO I DON'T SPEAK TO HIM.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.451
(suction gurgling)

14:11.451 --> 14:13.023
HE WANTS A BABY.

14:13.023 --> 14:14.624
DR. YANG DOESN'T.

14:14.624 --> 14:16.626
SO THEY DON'T SPEAK
TO EACH OTHER

14:16.626 --> 14:18.058
EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE MARRIED.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.190
SO...

14:20.190 --> 14:22.362
NO.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.364
HOW ABOUT YOU?

14:24.364 --> 14:25.535
(beeping continues)

14:25.535 --> 14:27.497
UM, MY GIRLFRIEND AND I
ARE GONNA...

14:27.497 --> 14:30.971
(suction gurgles)

14:30.971 --> 14:32.642
NOTHING.

14:32.642 --> 14:34.644
NOTHING.

14:34.644 --> 14:38.909
(beeping continues)

14:38.909 --> 14:41.081
WE THINK THIS THING
ON JANELL'S LUNG

14:41.081 --> 14:43.383
IS SOMETHING CALLED
A TERATOMA.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.216
IT'S CREATING ANTIBODIES
THAT ARE ATTACKING HER BRAIN.

14:46.216 --> 14:48.388
WELL, I DON'T GET IT.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.521
BASICALLY, HER BODY SEES
THE TUMOR AS AN INVADER

14:51.521 --> 14:53.023
AND IS ATTACKING IT,

14:53.023 --> 14:55.095
AND HER BRAIN IS GETTING HURT
IN THE CROSSFIRE.

14:55.095 --> 14:58.228
SO THIS THING ON HER LUNG
IS CAUSING HER SEIZURES?

14:58.228 --> 14:59.569
I THINK SO.

14:59.569 --> 15:01.571
WE'LL HAVE TO REMOVE IT
AND TEST IT TO MAKE SURE.

15:01.571 --> 15:05.105
O-OKAY, SO YOU TAKE IT OUT,
HER HEADACHES STOP,

15:05.105 --> 15:06.476
AND SHE WAKES UP
FROM THE COMA,

15:06.476 --> 15:08.979
AND WE GET TO GO ON
TO LIVE OUR LIVES?

15:08.979 --> 15:11.581
THAT'S THE PLAN.

15:11.581 --> 15:13.113
OKAY.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.485
(mouths word)

15:15.485 --> 15:17.487
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

15:17.487 --> 15:19.549
(sighs)

15:19.549 --> 15:23.193
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.

15:23.193 --> 15:25.655
SHE'S MY BETTER HALF.

15:25.655 --> 15:29.960
I MEAN, I KNOW PEOPLE
ALWAYS SAY THAT...

15:29.960 --> 15:31.531
BUT SHE REALLY IS.

15:33.463 --> 15:34.965
(Arizona)
YOU PAGED ME FOR THIS?

15:34.965 --> 15:36.236
WHY WOULD I DO THIS?

15:36.236 --> 15:37.507
BECAUSE IT'S FAIR.

15:37.507 --> 15:40.040
BECAUSE THE THREE OF US
ARE EQUAL PARENTS TO SOFIA

15:40.040 --> 15:42.672
AND THIS IS THE FAIR WAY
TO DECIDE WHO STAYS IN WITH HER.

15:42.672 --> 15:43.643
MM-HMM.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.345
UNLESS YOU'D RATHER
RAISE HER

15:45.345 --> 15:46.676
WITH NO SENSE OF FAIRNESS
OR DECENCY...

15:46.676 --> 15:47.647
(laughs)

15:47.647 --> 15:49.349
IN ANARCHY AND CHAOS.

15:49.349 --> 15:50.650
YOUR CALL.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.122
OKAY. FINE.

15:52.122 --> 15:54.254
BEST TWO OUT OF THREE?
BEST TWO OUT OF THREE.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.186
YOU READY?

15:56.186 --> 15:58.958
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.660
ROCK, PAPER,
SCISSORS.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.032
HA! MY ROCK...
OH!

16:02.032 --> 16:03.563
CRUSHES YOUR SCISSORS.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.295
ROCK--HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
TIME-OUT.

16:05.295 --> 16:07.397
TIME-OUT? I'M SORRY,
TIME-O--TIME-OUT?

16:07.397 --> 16:08.698
JACKSON, TEAM HUDDLE.

16:08.698 --> 16:10.300
OH, MY GOSH.
ARE YOU GUYS KIDDING ME?

16:10.300 --> 16:11.741
I MEAN, SOME OF US
HAVE SURGERIES.

16:11.741 --> 16:13.043
CAN YOU JUST
GIVE US A SECOND?

16:13.043 --> 16:14.304
(mutters)
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

16:14.304 --> 16:15.475
I THINK SHE'S GOING PAPER.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.646
SHE'S GOING WITH ROCKS.

16:16.646 --> 16:18.008
I'M THINKING
SHE'S A ROCK THROWER.

16:18.008 --> 16:19.349
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT SHE
WANTS YOU TO THINK. ALL RIGHT?

16:19.349 --> 16:20.680
THAT'S WHY SHE DID IT
TWO TIMES IN A ROW.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.213
THIS TIME, TRUST ME...
(whispers) GO SCISSORS.

16:23.213 --> 16:24.714
OKAY, YOU GUYS,
IT'S NOT A CHESS GAME.

16:24.714 --> 16:26.416
CAN WE JUST--
CAN WE DO THIS?
(normal voice) GET OUT THERE.

16:26.416 --> 16:28.218
(smacks buttocks)
WOW.

16:28.218 --> 16:29.589
(people speaking indistinctly)

16:29.589 --> 16:30.760
ALL RIGHT. (sighs)

16:30.760 --> 16:32.092
(cracks neck)

16:32.092 --> 16:33.363
(clears throat)

16:33.363 --> 16:34.524
HERE WE GO.

16:35.765 --> 16:37.397
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS.

16:37.397 --> 16:38.568
NO!
OH, YES!

16:38.568 --> 16:39.669
DAMN IT!
(laughs)

16:39.669 --> 16:41.431
I'M GETTING LUCKY TONIGHT.
HAPPY BABYSITTING.

16:41.431 --> 16:42.602
SEE YOU LATER.

16:42.602 --> 16:43.703
ALL RIGHT.
AVERY, I SAID ROCKS.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.106
MY GUT TOLD ME ROCKS.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.308
YOU MESSED WITH MY HEAD.
YOU ASKED MY OPINION.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.709
(whispers)
JULIA'S GONNA KILL ME.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.311
(sighs)

16:51.311 --> 16:52.612
(panting)

16:52.612 --> 16:54.684
SHE'S HAVING A SEVERE REACTION.
SORRY, CLEM.

16:54.684 --> 16:56.386
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GIVE YOU A SHOT.

16:56.386 --> 16:58.218
OKAY.
HAND?

16:58.218 --> 17:00.050
(exhales deeply)
YES, PLEASE.

17:00.050 --> 17:01.221
(woman) EXCUSE ME.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.493
OH, I'M SORRY.

17:03.493 --> 17:04.794
OH, CLEM.

17:04.794 --> 17:06.556
OH, HONEY.

17:06.556 --> 17:08.098
YOU POOR THING.

17:08.098 --> 17:09.559
HI, MOM.
SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.

17:09.559 --> 17:10.630
THE DOCTOR'S GONNA
GIVE HER A SHOT.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.162
HE'S ON TOP OF IT.

17:12.162 --> 17:13.763
WELL, I'M GLAD SOMEONE IS.
I DIDN'T KNOW.

17:13.763 --> 17:15.535
THE SCHOOL SENDS HOME NOTES
ALL THE TIME.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.767
IT'S IN EVERY NEWSLETTER.

17:17.767 --> 17:18.738
SHE CAN'T EVEN BE NEAR
PEANUT BUTTER.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.670
I HAVE A JOB, TERRI, OKAY?
THREE KIDS.

17:20.670 --> 17:22.712
EXCUSE ME IF I DON'T READ EVERY
NOTE THE SCHOOL SENDS HOME.

17:22.712 --> 17:24.414
I GAVE HER A SHOT
OF EPINEPHRINE.

17:24.414 --> 17:26.746
IT SHOULD DO THE TRICK.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.818
(continues panting)

17:28.818 --> 17:30.350
HE'S HYPOTHERMIC.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.681
YEAH.
THERE'S TOO MUCH BLEEDING.

17:31.681 --> 17:33.583
HE'S NOT GONNA MAKE IT
IF WE KEEP GOING.

17:33.583 --> 17:35.525
LET'S PACK HIM AND GET HIM
UP TO I.C.U.

17:35.525 --> 17:37.056
TO STABILIZE HIM.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.389
I AM NOT BABYSITTING.

17:39.389 --> 17:40.760
I HAVE MADE YOUR CAREER,

17:40.760 --> 17:42.192
AND I CAN BREAK IT.

17:42.192 --> 17:43.663
I NEED TO CHECK FOR
A SEPTAL HEMATOMA.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.435
I'LL BE QUICK.
I GOT A DATE TONIGHT.

17:45.435 --> 17:47.137
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I COULD BABYSIT?

17:47.137 --> 17:50.240
WELL, YOU KNOW C.P.R.,
YOU CAN THINK ON YOUR FEET,

17:50.240 --> 17:51.571
YOU'RE FIT,

17:51.571 --> 17:53.072
YOU CAN RUN OUT OF
A BURNING BUILDING IN NO TIME.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.605
SEPTUM LOOKS FINE.

17:55.605 --> 17:58.148
AND I'M NOT GONNA CANCEL
A DATE ON VALENTINE'S DAY.

17:58.148 --> 18:00.310
WOMEN CLAIM THAT THEY
DON'T CARE, BUT THEY ALL DO,

18:00.310 --> 18:01.651
A LOT.

18:01.651 --> 18:02.852
(Richard) OKAY, UH,
LET'S PREP HIM FOR I.C.U.

18:02.852 --> 18:04.514
AND I'LL--I'LL STAY
AND MONITOR HIM.

18:04.514 --> 18:06.116
NO, IT'S YOUR ANNIVERSARY.
I'LL STAY.

18:06.116 --> 18:07.687
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
A HOT DATE.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.860
REALLY? WITH WHO?

18:10.860 --> 18:13.693
UH...

18:13.693 --> 18:15.665
(clears throat)
UH, DR. SLOAN, I MEAN,

18:15.665 --> 18:17.867
IF YOU'RE FINISHED HERE,
WE'D LIKE TO--

18:17.867 --> 18:19.399
OH, I'LL TELL YOU
WHO'S FINISHED.

18:19.399 --> 18:20.800
YOU'RE FINISHED.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.632
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

18:22.632 --> 18:25.305
(door hisses)

18:25.305 --> 18:26.876
THANK YOU.

18:28.878 --> 18:30.880
(indistinct conversations)

18:30.880 --> 18:32.582
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

18:32.582 --> 18:34.684
(sighs)

18:34.684 --> 18:37.687
(indistinct conversations
continue)

18:42.392 --> 18:44.754
I ALREADY PRESSED IT.

18:44.754 --> 18:46.456
(whispers) WHATEVER.

18:46.456 --> 18:48.428
(elevator bell dings)

18:48.428 --> 18:50.200
(doors open)

18:50.200 --> 18:53.203
(indistinct conversations
continue)

18:55.905 --> 18:57.837
(clicks button)

19:01.411 --> 19:04.414
(motor whirring)

19:10.850 --> 19:12.382
I'M MOVING OUT.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.889
SO IF YOU NEED ME,
I'LL BE AT MY MOM'S

19:19.889 --> 19:21.831
TILL I, UH...

19:21.831 --> 19:25.435
FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.604
OKAY?

19:41.751 --> 19:44.214
OKAY.

19:44.214 --> 19:46.216
(ding)

19:46.216 --> 19:47.917
(doors open)

19:51.491 --> 19:54.794
(cries)

20:00.970 --> 20:02.902
HEY, I GOT YOUR MESSAGE
YOUR LUNG RESECTION WENT LONG.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.504
I PUSHED OUR RESERVATIONS
TO 8:00.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.506
REALLY? JUST LIKE THAT
ON VALENTINE'S DAY?

20:06.506 --> 20:07.677
I GOT CONNECTIONS.
(laughs)

20:07.677 --> 20:08.978
I COULD EVEN PUSH 'EM
TO 9:00 IF YOU LIKE.

20:08.978 --> 20:10.380
NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT. NO.

20:10.380 --> 20:11.711
AS SOON AS PATH CONFIRMS

20:11.711 --> 20:13.813
THAT THE MASS WE TOOK OUT
WAS THE TERATOMA,

20:13.813 --> 20:16.215
I WILL GO OUT TO MY CAR,

20:16.215 --> 20:17.717
GRAB THOSE HEELS...
(beeps)

20:17.717 --> 20:19.349
MM.
(elevator bell dings)

20:19.349 --> 20:20.990
BENIGN GRANULOMA.

20:20.990 --> 20:22.352
(sighs)

20:22.352 --> 20:23.523
(sighs) ALL RIGHT, FINE.

20:23.523 --> 20:24.854
PUSH THE RESERVATION
TO 9:00.

20:24.854 --> 20:25.825
MM-HMM.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.927
OHH.

20:29.459 --> 20:31.661
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?
YOU CAN GO.

20:31.661 --> 20:34.364
I'D LOVE TO.
I'D LOVE NOTHING MORE.

20:34.364 --> 20:36.836
BUT NICO WON'T LEAVE UNTIL
HE KNOWS CLEM'S GONNA BE OKAY.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.339
HE'S 10.
WHO'S THE PARENT HERE?

20:39.339 --> 20:41.271
YOU LET THAT KID RUN WILD.

20:41.271 --> 20:42.672
AT LEAST I DON'T
HOVER OVER HIM,

20:42.672 --> 20:43.873
AFRAID TO LET HIM
OUT OF MY SIGHT.

20:43.873 --> 20:45.415
WELL, MAYBE I NEED TO HOVER

20:45.415 --> 20:46.746
BECAUSE YOU AND YOUR SON
WON'T LEAVE US ALONE.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.778
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING,
DROPPING HIM

20:48.778 --> 20:50.019
AT MY HOUSE TODAY
WHEN I WASN'T HOME?

20:50.019 --> 20:51.621
HE WASN'T GONNA STAY.

20:51.621 --> 20:52.922
HE JUST WANTED TO GIVE
YOUR SPOILED DAUGHTER

20:52.922 --> 20:54.724
A BOX OF FREAKIN' CHOCOLATES.

20:54.724 --> 20:55.885
WELL, STOP GIVING US THINGS.

20:55.885 --> 20:57.327
WE BARELY SURVIVED
THE HEAD LICE HE GAVE HER.

20:57.327 --> 20:59.559
YOU HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING
WHO GAVE WHO THE HEAD LICE.

20:59.559 --> 21:00.960
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.793
THEY'RE 10.
THEY'RE IN LOVE. THEY'RE CUTE.

21:03.793 --> 21:05.565
LET THEM BE CUTE,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.537
EXCUSE ME, DOCTOR,
SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH CLEM.
(labored breathing)

21:07.537 --> 21:09.499
SHE'S BREATHING FUNNY.

21:09.499 --> 21:12.342
(Alex) GET ME A SIZE 6
E.T. TUBE.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

21:12.342 --> 21:14.644
HER AIRWAY IS SHUTTING DOWN.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO INTUBATE.

21:14.644 --> 21:16.306
OH, MY GOD.

21:16.306 --> 21:18.908
HERE YOU GO.
GIVE ME SOME CRIKE PRESSURE.

21:18.908 --> 21:20.980
(cries)

21:20.980 --> 21:23.883
ALL RIGHT.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.715
I'M IN.

21:25.715 --> 21:26.886
ALL RIGHT.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.958
THERE'S GOOD COLOR CHANGE.

21:28.958 --> 21:30.660
SATs ARE COMING UP.

21:30.660 --> 21:31.721
WHAT HAPPENED?

21:31.721 --> 21:32.892
ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.394
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO KEEP HER OVERNIGHT

21:34.394 --> 21:35.865
AND SEE HOW SHE RESPONDS.

21:35.865 --> 21:37.427
BUT--BUT SHE'S
GONNA BE OKAY?

21:37.427 --> 21:38.798
YEAH, YEAH, I THINK SO.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.970
NOW WILL YOU GO?

21:40.970 --> 21:42.532
PLEASE.

21:45.335 --> 21:47.607
(Meredith)
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

21:47.607 --> 21:50.440
JANELL'S LABS SHOW
SHE HAS A TERATOMA.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.842
THEN THE LUCKY WOMAN
HAS TWO TUMORS--

21:52.842 --> 21:55.485
THE BENIGN ONE THAT WE JUST
TOOK OUT OF HER LUNG

21:55.485 --> 21:56.786
AND ANOTHER ONE--

21:56.786 --> 21:58.317
WHERE?

21:58.317 --> 22:00.790
HER SCANS AND HER ULTRASOUND
ARE CLEAN.
(beeping)

22:00.790 --> 22:02.492
WHAT IF IT'S MICROSCOPIC?

22:02.492 --> 22:04.424
OKAY, UM...

22:04.424 --> 22:08.097
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT
N.M.D.A. RECEPTOR TERATOMAS?

22:08.097 --> 22:10.830
WE KNOW
THEY'RE MOST COMMONLY FOUND

22:10.830 --> 22:13.663
ON THE OVARIES.

22:14.904 --> 22:16.466
YOU WANT TO TAKE OUT
HER OVARIES?

22:16.466 --> 22:17.767
SHE'S 32 YEARS OLD.

22:17.767 --> 22:20.770
THEY'RE ALWAYS 32
AND NICE AND UNDESERVING.

22:20.770 --> 22:23.473
THESE KIND OF THINGS
DON'T HAPPEN TO NASTY PEOPLE.

22:23.473 --> 22:25.074
(sighs)

22:25.074 --> 22:27.517
HIS VITALS ARE HOLDING.
(sighs)

22:27.517 --> 22:28.918
THAT'S GOOD.

22:28.918 --> 22:33.383
MM. HIS PUPILS
ARE A LITTLE SLUGGISH.

22:33.383 --> 22:35.955
SHARON, ARE YOU OKAY?

22:35.955 --> 22:37.957
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

22:37.957 --> 22:41.691
(crying)
I HAD A RING PICKED OUT.

22:41.691 --> 22:43.733
I SENT A PICTURE OF IT

22:43.733 --> 22:45.635
TO ALL OF MY SISTERS

22:45.635 --> 22:48.768
SO, UH, THEY COULD HELP
CHARLIE SURPRISE ME

22:48.768 --> 22:50.840
WHEN THE TIME CAME,

22:50.840 --> 22:53.002
'CAUSE THAT RING
WAS IMPORTANT.

22:53.002 --> 22:57.477
IT WAS SO FREAKING IMPORTANT.

22:57.477 --> 22:58.978
LOOK AT HIM.

22:58.978 --> 23:01.881
HE LOOKS--HE'S...
HE LOOKS...

23:01.881 --> 23:04.454
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THAT CRAP ANYMORE.

23:04.454 --> 23:06.456
AND I DON'T NEED
A STUPID RING.

23:06.456 --> 23:07.917
I JUST... (sniffles)

23:07.917 --> 23:10.059
I JUST NEED HIM.

23:10.059 --> 23:13.623
THAT'S IT. I JUST WANT HIM
TO BE OKAY.

23:13.623 --> 23:16.926
PLEASE.
JUST LET HIM BE OKAY.

23:19.869 --> 23:21.400
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

23:21.400 --> 23:22.902
YOUR INCISION LOOKS GOOD.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.504
(people speaking indistinctly)

23:24.504 --> 23:26.706
YOU SHOULD BE BACK ON YOUR FEET
IN A FEW WEEKS,

23:26.706 --> 23:28.878
BUT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND
PULLING ANY MORE ALL-NIGHTERS,

23:28.878 --> 23:31.010
EVEN ON HOLIDAYS
LIKE TODAY.

23:31.010 --> 23:33.042
OH, TRUST ME, BROTHER.
I'M DONE.

23:33.042 --> 23:35.044

WHAT A STUPID BUSINESS.

23:35.044 --> 23:36.746
PEOPLE CALL YOU UP, YOU KNOW,

23:36.746 --> 23:38.147
THEY ASK YOU TO MAKE
SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL.

23:38.147 --> 23:40.550
YEAH, SO SOME SORRY SCHLEP
CAN FORGET THAT

23:40.550 --> 23:43.092
THEY'VE BEEN TREATED LIKE CRAP
EVERY OTHER DAY OF THE YEAR.

23:43.092 --> 23:44.794
(inhales deeply)

23:44.794 --> 23:47.627
YEAH, LIKE MY FLOWERS
ARE MAGIC OR SOMETHING.

23:47.627 --> 23:49.629
BUT I BOUGHT IT.

23:49.629 --> 23:51.100
NEARLY KILLED MYSELF
TRYING TO MAKE SURE

23:51.100 --> 23:53.903
EVERYBODY GOT
THEIR LITTLE MIRACLE.

23:53.903 --> 23:56.706
WHAT A JOKE.
(coughs)

23:56.706 --> 23:59.008
PEOPLE OUGHTA JUST STOP
BEING SO AWFUL TO EACH OTHER,

23:59.008 --> 24:00.670
YOU KNOW?

24:00.670 --> 24:02.141
LEAVE ME OUT OF IT.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.916
DR. YANG
WILL CHECK ON YOU LATER.

24:06.916 --> 24:08.548
THANK YOU.

24:08.548 --> 24:09.979
(woman) THANK YOU.

24:09.979 --> 24:11.981
(people speaking indistinctly)

24:11.981 --> 24:14.954
CAN I JUST TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

24:19.088 --> 24:21.991
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH HELL,
AND I KNOW I WAS PART OF IT.

24:21.991 --> 24:23.693
AND I KNOW YOU'RE GRIEVING,

24:23.693 --> 24:26.035
AND THERE'S NO MAGIC SOLUTION
TO THAT, BUT...

24:26.035 --> 24:28.498
(sighs) WE USED TO BE FRIENDS.

24:28.498 --> 24:30.069
AND I REALLY...

24:30.069 --> 24:33.743
REALLY NEED A FRIEND TODAY.

24:33.743 --> 24:36.746
SO HOW ABOUT WE JUST
GO ACROSS THE STREET TO JOE'S,

24:36.746 --> 24:38.477
AND I'LL BUY YOU A DRINK,
YOU KNOW?

24:38.477 --> 24:42.211
OR I WILL BUY YOU MANY,
MANY DRINKS.

24:42.211 --> 24:43.983
ARE YOU DONE?

24:43.983 --> 24:45.114
ARE YOU FINISHED?

24:45.114 --> 24:46.616
YES.

24:46.616 --> 24:48.487
I HATE YOU.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.489
FROM THE MOMENT YOU DECIDED TO
PUT THE NEEDS OF YOUR HOSPITAL

24:50.489 --> 24:52.121
OVER MY DEAD HUSBAND,
I HAVE HATED YOU.

24:52.121 --> 24:54.493
I LIE IN BED AT NIGHT ALONE,

24:54.493 --> 24:56.826
AND I LOOK AT THE SPOT WHERE
MY HUSBAND USED TO SLEEP,

24:56.826 --> 24:58.928
AND I ACTIVELY...

24:58.928 --> 25:02.532
(voice breaking) WITH EVERY CELL
IN MY BODY, HATE YOU.

25:02.532 --> 25:05.074
I WISH YOU WERE DEAD
INSTEAD OF HIM.

25:05.074 --> 25:06.836
I THINK ABOUT ALL THE SOLDIERS,
GOOD MEN,

25:06.836 --> 25:08.137
WHO DIED OVER THERE IN IRAQ,

25:08.137 --> 25:10.009
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT KIND OF GOD

25:10.009 --> 25:11.911
WOULD ALLOW YOU TO SURVIVE.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.212
WE ARE NOT FRIENDS.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.114
THIS IS NOT GRIEF.
IT WILL NOT PASS.

25:15.114 --> 25:17.186
I HATE YOU!

25:17.186 --> 25:20.019
PLEASE...
DON'T SPEAK TO ME AGAIN

25:20.019 --> 25:22.121
UNLESS IT'S WORK RELATED.

25:25.154 --> 25:27.156
L-L-LET ME--
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

25:27.156 --> 25:29.559
ALL RIGHT, YOU--YOU TAKE
THIS THING OUT OF HER LUNGS,

25:29.559 --> 25:31.160
AND IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THOUGHT IT WAS.

25:31.160 --> 25:32.662
NOW YOU WANT TO TAKE OUT
HER OVARIES.

25:32.662 --> 25:34.163
THE KIND OF ANTIBODIES
THAT SHE HAD

25:34.163 --> 25:38.067
ARE MOST COMMONLY ASSOCIATED
WITH TERATOMAS OF THE OVARIES.

25:38.067 --> 25:40.109
BUT THEY CAN SOMETIMES
BE FOUND IN OTHER PLACES,

25:40.109 --> 25:42.942
WHICH IS WHY WE THOUGHT
THE MASS ON HER LUNG WAS IT.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.544
CHANCES ARE HIGH THAT
IT'S ON HER OVARIES.

25:45.544 --> 25:46.916
CHANCES ARE?

25:46.916 --> 25:48.778
THAT'S THE BEST
YOU CAN DO?

25:48.778 --> 25:49.919
SHE'S YOUNG.

25:49.919 --> 25:52.582
SHE STILL WANTS KIDS.
WE...

25:52.582 --> 25:53.953
NO.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.124
YOU'RE DOCTORS.

25:55.124 --> 25:56.586
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
A HELL OF A LOT BETTER

25:56.586 --> 25:57.987
THAN "CHANCES ARE."

25:57.987 --> 25:59.989
IF WE DO NOTHING,

25:59.989 --> 26:01.961
SHE WILL CONTINUE
TO HAVE THE SEIZURES.

26:01.961 --> 26:04.563
AND EVENTUALLY, HER BODY
WILL JUST COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.596
AND BY THAT TIME,
SHE WILL HAVE SUFFERED

26:06.596 --> 26:08.067
SO MUCH BRAIN DAMAGE

26:08.067 --> 26:11.200
THAT JANELL, THE WOMAN
THAT YOU LOVE, SHE'LL BE GONE.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.128
OH.

26:39.128 --> 26:40.830
(clears throat) DID YOU
GET THESE FROM A PATIENT?

26:40.830 --> 26:42.131
NO.

26:42.131 --> 26:44.133
I BOUGHT THESE
FOR JULIA, BUT...

26:44.133 --> 26:45.835
SHE'S STANDING ME UP

26:45.835 --> 26:47.336

TRANSPLANT SURGERY, SO...

CANDY AND FLOWERS.

27:37.656 --> 27:40.129

WHAT IS HAPPENING?

27:40.129 --> 27:41.160
SHARON...

ONE SECOND AGO.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.862

28:24.433 --> 28:26.776
HIS HEART STOPPED,
WE TRIED TO REVIVE HIM,

28:26.776 --> 28:28.437
BUT DESPITE OUR BEST EFFORTS,
HE DIDN'T MAKE IT.

28:28.437 --> 28:30.709
HE DIED AT 7:53 P.M.

28:30.709 --> 28:33.813
(sobbing)

28:38.788 --> 28:40.790
(woman) NO INDICATION
OF A TUMOR.

28:40.790 --> 28:42.091
IT COULD BE
MICROSCOPIC.

28:42.091 --> 28:43.853
THERE'S A LOT OF ADHESIONS
ON THIS ONE,

28:43.853 --> 28:45.254
THAT COULD MEAN
INFLAMMATION.

28:45.254 --> 28:46.495
WHICH COULD MEAN A TERATOMA.

28:46.495 --> 28:47.797
SO LET'S TAKE OUT
THE RIGHT OVARY,

28:47.797 --> 28:49.859
SEND IT TO PATH,
AND TRY TO SAVE THE LEFT ONE.

28:49.859 --> 28:52.201
