WEBVTT

00:00.058 --> 00:02.570
It's me, and your father.
We're home.

00:02.581 --> 00:04.578
I don't know if you forgot,
but we've been in Paris,

00:04.608 --> 00:07.510
and we flew across oceans and
oceans just to see you again.

00:07.520 --> 00:11.213
And, so, we would really 
like to see you again --

00:11.223 --> 00:14.172
today, tonight, A.S.A.P., okay?

00:14.182 --> 00:16.722
So please call me.
Call me back.

00:16.732 --> 00:20.902
S.T.A.S.A.P --
sooner than as soon as possible.

00:20.912 --> 00:23.920
Okay, honey, call me.
Call me. Call me.

00:23.930 --> 00:25.316
Call. Okay. Bye.

00:25.327 --> 00:27.800
Okay, that was your last one.
I'm cutting you off.

00:27.813 --> 00:29.911
She will call you
when she wakes up.

00:30.787 --> 00:32.003
Now sit.

00:34.219 --> 00:36.752
I need an open mind.
Are you giving me an open mind?

00:36.769 --> 00:37.743
Okay, it's open.

00:37.757 --> 00:38.583
Wide open?

00:38.595 --> 00:42.443
Yeah, yeah, blue skies, green grass,
vistas as far as the eye can see.

00:42.457 --> 00:44.601
Good, because I want
you to picture,

00:44.735 --> 00:46.432
on this wall,

00:46.528 --> 00:47.910
a waterfall.

00:48.208 --> 00:50.931
You know, one of those wall waterfalls--
they're really soothing.

00:50.948 --> 00:52.222
- Slam --
- What?

00:52.235 --> 00:53.823
The sound of my mind closing.

00:53.838 --> 00:55.941
Come on. We could get 
a barcalounger right here

00:55.958 --> 00:58.233
and just lean back and listen--
it'd be like living in Hawaii.

00:58.265 --> 01:00.232
Are you serious--
a barcalounger?

01:00.245 --> 01:02.621
Soft leather, button back pad
adjustable footrest.

01:02.637 --> 01:03.902
You know what else
would be awesome?

01:03.937 --> 01:05.563
Not having a barcalounger?

01:05.578 --> 01:08.340
Flat-screen TV here--
high def, day and night.

01:08.355 --> 01:09.810
You know what else might work?

01:09.826 --> 01:12.132
One of those electronic fish--
what do they call it? --

01:12.147 --> 01:13.563
the big-mouth billy bass.

01:13.577 --> 01:15.022
You know what they are, right?
When somebody walks by,

01:15.057 --> 01:17.341
they flap their mouths
and sing songs like

01:17.357 --> 01:19.620
"Don't worry,
be happy" and "Take me to the river."

01:21.587 --> 01:22.463
You're kidding.

01:22.476 --> 01:25.511
I'm totally kidding, except for the
flat-screen. We need a flat-screen.

01:25.525 --> 01:28.422
No! I'd rather have the
big-mouth billy bass fish.

01:28.438 --> 01:29.460
What's wrong with
the flat-screen?

01:29.498 --> 01:32.560
It's so "meet Georges Jetson,
his boy, Elroy" -- Leroy?

01:32.577 --> 01:34.351
Elroy -- and it's not.

01:34.368 --> 01:37.003
Look, I'm all for
small-town charm.

01:37.017 --> 01:39.763
I'm happy to move here,
sit out on the front porch,

01:39.778 --> 01:41.820
and give the mailman a
real chipper "howdy-do."

01:41.838 --> 01:43.490
- Don't you dare.
- But there's a line.

01:43.506 --> 01:45.920
I'm not gonna cobble my own shoes,
churn butter,

01:45.938 --> 01:48.092
or watch a TV from 1976.

01:48.107 --> 01:51.761
What? This baby has a remote
that has 19 buttons on it.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.263
You do have running water,
don't you?

01:53.277 --> 01:54.250
Hardy Har Har.

01:54.265 --> 01:56.503
Oh, you can say "hardy Har Har,"
but I can't say "howdy-do"?

01:56.536 --> 01:57.563
Life's not fair.

01:57.576 --> 02:00.161
What's your problem with a giant
flat-screen? I mean, you love TV.

02:00.196 --> 02:01.572
Yeah! But just because
I love something

02:01.605 --> 02:03.681
doesn't mean I want
it to be giant.

02:03.695 --> 02:05.322
I love grapes, you know,

02:05.338 --> 02:07.910
but I don't want to sit down
and eat one humongous--

02:07.925 --> 02:09.252
No, that would be fun.

02:09.735 --> 02:10.681
Hello?

02:10.696 --> 02:12.240
Hey. Welcome home.

02:12.256 --> 02:14.530
Finally! I have been
calling and calling.

02:14.546 --> 02:16.423
Yes, I know, since 5:00 a.m.

02:16.436 --> 02:18.372
Well, that's noon
parisian time.

02:18.385 --> 02:19.962
Well, then you should call
your parisian daughter

02:19.996 --> 02:21.762
because your american
one was asleep.

02:21.777 --> 02:23.660
- Hi, honey.
- Your dad says hi.

02:23.676 --> 02:25.510
Hi dad, how was the trip?

02:25.525 --> 02:28.602
Tonight. I'll tell you everything
when you come for dinner tonight.

02:28.617 --> 02:29.772
I can't come tonight.

02:29.786 --> 02:31.200
What? You have to.

02:31.215 --> 02:32.363
I have a study group.

02:32.377 --> 02:34.743
My major english quotes
professor's trying to kill me.

02:34.757 --> 02:37.023
Well, all the more reason
to stay away from him.

02:37.036 --> 02:38.892
Seriously, he sounds dangerous.

02:38.905 --> 02:40.151
I'll come over the weekend.

02:40.167 --> 02:42.030
No, Rory, it has to be tonight.

02:42.045 --> 02:43.142
Why?

02:43.156 --> 02:46.231
Uh... s-snails.

02:46.337 --> 02:47.370
S nails?

02:47.388 --> 02:50.823
W-We --
your dad and I brought back snails.

02:50.838 --> 02:51.991
For eating?

02:52.006 --> 02:55.820
Yes, and if we don't
cook them tonight,

02:55.835 --> 02:57.403
they'll go bad.

02:57.415 --> 02:58.331
Mom.

02:58.347 --> 02:59.912
Well, it's true.

02:59.926 --> 03:02.280
It has to be tonight. Please.

03:03.067 --> 03:05.411
- Fine. I'll be there.
- Good!

03:05.426 --> 03:06.682
I'm going back to bed.

03:06.696 --> 03:09.760
Oh, what? At 1:00 in the afternoon?
Lazy girl.

03:09.777 --> 03:11.393
My parisian daughter's
such a go-getter.

03:11.407 --> 03:12.851
She's been up and
around for hours.

03:12.868 --> 03:13.910
See you tonight.

03:15.226 --> 03:16.820
All right, she's coming.

03:16.947 --> 03:17.861
Snails?

03:17.878 --> 03:21.453
Well, I just --
as long as she's coming.

03:21.465 --> 03:22.531
So you said snails?

03:22.545 --> 03:24.222
Well, I had to say something.

03:24.235 --> 03:26.311
Well, at least we
have a plan now.

03:26.327 --> 03:28.523
We'll sit her down in the kitchen,
feed her snails,

03:28.538 --> 03:30.512
and tell her we got married.

03:30.527 --> 03:32.142
Oh, my god.

03:32.505 --> 03:34.462
I just hate that
she doesn't know.

03:34.478 --> 03:36.522
She's gonna know tonight
when we tell her.

03:36.535 --> 03:37.873
Yeah.

03:38.466 --> 03:39.872
- Lor?
- Yeah.

03:39.885 --> 03:41.252
She's gonna be happy.

03:41.265 --> 03:44.093
Her parents just got married.
It's the dream.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.672
Yeah.

03:46.257 --> 03:48.311
Maybe I should tell
her by myself.

03:48.325 --> 03:50.392
Together -- we agreed.
We're gonna tell her together.

03:50.426 --> 03:51.812
Yeah, no, you're right.
You're right. I'm sorry.

03:51.847 --> 03:54.203
I'm just so used to it
just being me and her.

03:54.305 --> 03:56.123
I'll feel better
when she knows.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.932
Well, she'll know tonight
when we tell her...

03:57.935 --> 03:59.440
- Yeah.
- ...with snails.

03:59.805 --> 04:01.271
Now we have to get snails.

04:01.285 --> 04:02.932
- We'll find snails.
- Where do you get snails?

04:02.966 --> 04:05.282
- Maybe Doose's has snails.
- Doose's doesn't have snails.

04:05.297 --> 04:07.973
Well, then, we'll go 
to a snail store -- emporium.

04:07.988 --> 04:09.010
We'll find snails.

04:09.028 --> 04:10.331
And a recipe. 

04:10.346 --> 04:12.923
They will have a recipe
at the snail emporium.

04:12.935 --> 04:14.111
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:14.127 --> 04:14.972
All right.

04:16.000 --> 04:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:08.597 --> 05:10.011
So you really liked
the chamber music?

05:10.047 --> 05:11.863
The part I was
awake for, anyway.

05:11.876 --> 05:14.760
And  then, after that,
we went to see a basketball game.

05:14.778 --> 05:16.170
Slightly less obscure.

05:16.187 --> 05:18.941
Yeah, right? A lot of people seem
to be into the sports thing.

05:18.958 --> 05:21.871
And I can see why --
the fastpace, the school spirit.

05:21.886 --> 05:22.962
You  liked it?

05:22.978 --> 05:24.992
Again, the part
I was awake for.

05:25.005 --> 05:27.282
Wow, a real
basketball fan, huh?

05:29.105 --> 05:31.351
Ah! Oh, my god!

05:34.335 --> 05:35.841
What is wrong with you!

05:35.856 --> 05:36.932
You're not happy to see me.

05:36.948 --> 05:39.441
Well, of course I am,
but why do you insist

05:39.456 --> 05:41.633
on scaring me half to death
every time you're in town?

05:41.648 --> 05:43.293
Well, besides the fact
that it's really fun --

05:43.327 --> 05:45.370
well, actually, that's it.
It's just really fun.

05:45.388 --> 05:48.793
Oh man. Just once, you could call
me and tell me you're coming home,

05:48.807 --> 05:49.981
like a normal person.

05:49.997 --> 05:51.710
Normal's borring.
Normal's overrated.

05:51.723 --> 05:53.381
Normal's not why you love me.

05:54.097 --> 05:56.283
So, what's going on?
Why are you here?

05:56.299 --> 05:58.602
You know that space we've been
trying to book for our launch party?

05:58.639 --> 05:59.823
- The Orchid room.
- Yeah.

05:59.836 --> 06:02.100
The problem is,
it's booked till 2008,

06:02.115 --> 06:04.803
or it was until Nadine Maybrooke
broke up with Jamie Erman,

06:04.816 --> 06:07.533
thus canceling their engagement party
and freeing the space up tonight.

06:07.566 --> 06:09.072
Poor Nadine and Jamie.

06:09.085 --> 06:11.112
Hey, I invited them.
The more the merrier.

06:11.126 --> 06:12.122
So, it's gonna be huge.

06:12.138 --> 06:13.770
So, you're having your
launch party tonight.

06:13.808 --> 06:16.013
Well, actually,
it's our prelaunch launch party.

06:16.025 --> 06:18.751
Our launch party will take
more than 48 hours to plan.

06:18.767 --> 06:20.483
It starts at 9:00.
You can be there, right?

06:20.495 --> 06:22.280
Oh yeah,
I'm having dinner with my parents,

06:22.295 --> 06:23.932
but I can stop by right after.

06:23.945 --> 06:25.242
When did they get
back from France?

06:25.275 --> 06:28.192
Last night. I would juste skip it,
but my mom really wants to see me

06:28.207 --> 06:30.261
and, apparently,
make me snails.

06:30.276 --> 06:33.290
Okay. Well, then,
I guess I'll see you post-snails.

06:33.306 --> 06:36.510
It should be a pretty good time.
We've got a huge guest list.

06:36.526 --> 06:38.090
Bobbi's pulled
out all the stops.

06:38.108 --> 06:41.562
She's contracted five of the
hottest P.R. agents in the city

06:41.577 --> 06:43.670
and has them hunkered
in a war room.

06:43.688 --> 06:45.743
I'd be surprised if she lets
them take bathroom breaks.

06:45.777 --> 06:47.030
You can't stop Bobbi.

06:47.046 --> 06:47.860
Ace.

06:47.877 --> 06:49.761
What? No, I like Bobbi. I do.

06:49.776 --> 06:52.340
I don't like the fact that
she's not a big, swarthy dude.

06:52.357 --> 06:55.673
But I recognize that my issues with
Bobbi have nothing to do with her.

06:55.685 --> 06:57.981
She's lovely.
She's your colleague.

06:57.995 --> 06:59.692
It doesn't matter that her
legs come up to my nose.

06:59.727 --> 07:01.091
"A big, swarthy dude"?

07:01.108 --> 07:02.452
With a cheesy goatee.

07:02.467 --> 07:04.302
Well, maybe she'll
agree to the goatee.

07:04.316 --> 07:07.732
And, hey, you want to come with me
tomorrow and check out apartments?

07:07.745 --> 07:10.002
Apartments? Like, to live in?

07:10.018 --> 07:13.070
I know it is cliché, but, yes,
I intend to live in my apartment.

07:13.087 --> 07:14.180
In Manhattan?

07:14.197 --> 07:16.151
Unless I strike you as
Staten Island kind of guy.

07:16.155 --> 07:17.912
- You're moving to New York.
- Pretty much.

07:17.926 --> 07:19.332
Which is an hour away?

07:19.346 --> 07:20.770
Actually, an hour
and 20 minutes.

07:20.786 --> 07:22.821
That's so much
closer than London!

07:22.836 --> 07:24.451
You've been brushing
up on your geography?

07:24.488 --> 07:26.802
No, I just can't believe it.
I mean, it's huge.

07:26.815 --> 07:28.653
It's amazing. I --

07:28.667 --> 07:29.433
Are you happy?

07:29.446 --> 07:31.153
I'm so happy!

07:31.688 --> 07:33.221
Come on.
Let's get something to drink.

07:33.237 --> 07:34.901
But why do you have to
get your own apartment?

07:34.936 --> 07:36.370
Why can't you just
live here with me?

07:36.406 --> 07:39.311
I'd love to, Ace, but I think I'd
end up seeing more of the I-95

07:39.326 --> 07:41.501
than I would of you.
I mean, my hours are gonna be crazy.

07:41.537 --> 07:44.253
If I live near the office,
I can crawl home at 3:00 in the morning

07:44.266 --> 07:46.343
- and crawl back to work at 7:00.
- It's a lot of crawling.

07:46.375 --> 07:48.562
It just doesn't make
sense logistically.

07:48.577 --> 07:50.371
So it's just gonna be me here?

07:50.387 --> 07:52.021
Well, you were gonna live
here by yourself anyway.

07:52.056 --> 07:54.313
I know, but if you're gonna
have your whole new apartment,

07:54.346 --> 07:56.390
then you're gonna
need all your stuff.

07:56.406 --> 07:58.161
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna clean you out, Ace.

07:58.198 --> 07:59.432
I'll be fine. Take your stuff.

07:59.448 --> 08:00.993
It's not gonna happened.
New apartment, new stuff.

08:01.028 --> 08:01.901
R eally?

08:01.918 --> 08:04.202
Yeah. I-I want a fresh start.

08:04.218 --> 08:06.282
Hey, well,
you should take some of your stuff,

08:06.298 --> 08:07.522
like your favorite stuff.

08:07.535 --> 08:08.572
Like what?

08:08.587 --> 08:12.022
Like, you know, you can't live
without your suit of armor, can you?

08:12.037 --> 08:13.603
I mean,
you really want to take that.

08:13.618 --> 08:14.841
You don't like Henry?

08:14.858 --> 08:18.012
Well, it's not that I don't like him.
It's just that he creeps me out.

08:18.028 --> 08:19.880
Oh man,
now you just hurt Henry's feelings.

08:19.895 --> 08:22.332
Well, he's gonna have to grow a
little tougher chain mail then

08:22.365 --> 08:24.623
if he's gonna make it on the
mean streets of New York.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.382
You're heartless, Gilmore.

08:28.248 --> 08:29.400
You hungry?

08:29.417 --> 08:30.593
You want some juice?

08:30.605 --> 08:31.853
Notice my hair is green?

08:32.067 --> 08:33.910
- Uh, hey?
- Diner's ready.

08:33.927 --> 08:34.821
Five more minutes?

08:34.837 --> 08:36.582
After dinner --
wash your hands.

08:37.097 --> 08:39.113
What's so interesting, anyway?

08:39.126 --> 08:40.311
Hyperphagia.

08:40.326 --> 08:42.022
Oh, right. Cool.

08:42.034 --> 08:44.451
That's just a fancy
term for overeating.

08:44.465 --> 08:46.392
It's what bears do in
preparation for hibernation.

08:46.425 --> 08:48.931
Oh hey, did I tell you about the time
I saw a grizzly bear on a camping trip?

08:48.967 --> 08:51.692
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. 500 pounds, easy.

08:51.705 --> 08:54.493
Turkey burgers,
sweet potato fries, broccoli.

08:54.508 --> 08:56.521
Thanks. So, what did you do?

08:56.535 --> 08:59.431
Just backed away real slow,
avoided eye contact --

08:59.448 --> 09:01.091
that's how you show
you're submissive.

09:01.105 --> 09:01.922
Really?

09:01.936 --> 09:03.410
Yeah, it's all
about body language.

09:03.428 --> 09:05.550
And you've got to
try to stay calm.

09:06.116 --> 09:07.200
Were you?

09:07.218 --> 09:08.550
No.

09:09.725 --> 09:12.803
I forgot to tell you what happened
with Rachel at school today.

09:12.818 --> 09:15.123
Did she apologize to Melissa?
Are they talking again?

09:15.138 --> 09:17.652
Yeah, but they won't be as
soon as Melissa finds out

09:17.666 --> 09:19.623
that Rachel asked Joanna to
come with her to Florida

09:19.656 --> 09:21.110
to visit her grandparents.

09:21.127 --> 09:23.171
Hey, did you remember
to wash my jean skirt?

09:23.185 --> 09:24.521
It's hanging in the bathroom.

09:24.535 --> 09:26.390
Cool. I want to wear
it to Sabrina's party.

09:26.408 --> 09:28.282
I was going to wear
that purple dress,

09:28.297 --> 09:31.721
but last time I wore it,
Adam called me "purple Nardini" all day.

09:32.125 --> 09:34.553
Yeah, it's a pretty
uninspired insult,

09:34.565 --> 09:36.601
but the way he said
it was so annoying.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.730
And now,
since he knows it bugs me,

09:38.745 --> 09:41.552
he's probably just gonna
keep saying it all night.

09:41.797 --> 09:43.071
"All night"?

09:43.088 --> 09:44.131
At Sabrina's party.

09:44.147 --> 09:46.481
Why would Adam be at her party?

09:47.217 --> 09:48.561
Because he was invited.

09:48.576 --> 09:50.222
To Sabrina's birthday?

09:50.348 --> 09:51.412
Well, yeah.

09:51.427 --> 09:53.390
- Sabrina's a girl, right?
- Yeah.

09:53.406 --> 09:55.080
- And Adam's a boy? 
- Yeah.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.032
And he'll be at her party?

09:57.047 --> 09:58.673
Yeah, it's a boy-girl party.

09:58.687 --> 09:59.983
What's that mean?

09:59.998 --> 10:02.982
It means there will
both be boys...

10:03.346 --> 10:04.893
and girls at the party.

10:04.906 --> 10:05.781
Yeah. All right.

10:05.797 --> 10:08.683
I just didn't know you were going
to boy-girl parties. That's all.

10:08.696 --> 10:09.972
It's my first one.

10:09.986 --> 10:11.782
I  only got invited
'cause Sabrina's parents

10:11.795 --> 10:13.772
made her invite
the whole class.

10:13.785 --> 10:15.873
But I'm not about to look
a gift horse in the mouth.

10:15.886 --> 10:19.500
So, you're mom's okay with
you going to a boy-girl party?

10:19.608 --> 10:21.292
Of course. I'm 13.

10:21.308 --> 10:23.992
So, um, listen.

10:24.007 --> 10:26.520
This is probably a
stupid question, but...

10:27.648 --> 10:29.592
is there gonna be
kissing at this party?

10:29.607 --> 10:31.573
Okay! Ew, dad!

10:31.587 --> 10:32.920
- What?
- Oh, gross!

10:32.937 --> 10:34.022
What's gross-- kissing?

10:34.036 --> 10:36.492
No, you talking about kissing.

10:36.507 --> 10:38.423
What? All right, all right,
I won't say "kissing."

10:38.457 --> 10:40.690
Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, ew!
Stop! Stop!

10:40.708 --> 10:44.342
All right! All right! I'm not saying
it at all. Done -- new topic.

10:45.715 --> 10:47.071
I promise.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.361
- The fries are really good.
- Good.

10:52.378 --> 10:54.642
Good. Then eat your
broccoli, too.

10:58.327 --> 10:59.673
Hello?!

10:59.686 --> 11:01.123
Honey!

11:01.186 --> 11:03.112
Oh, hi!

11:03.176 --> 11:05.023
And that's how we do
it on the continent.

11:05.035 --> 11:06.153
But of course. Hey, dad.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.443
Hi, honey.

11:07.536 --> 11:09.180
Come on. Come in! Come in!

11:09.196 --> 11:10.862
Okay. What are you wearing?

11:10.978 --> 11:12.750
I hear it's called an apron.

11:12.766 --> 11:14.323
Interesting. Why are
you wearing that?

11:14.338 --> 11:16.591
- Because I've been cooking snails.
- You're kidding me.

11:16.608 --> 11:18.562
And cooking snails
and dealing with snail spatter.

11:18.567 --> 11:19.873
- She really cook those?
- She did.

11:19.908 --> 11:21.253
What do you mean?
I told you I was gonna cook them.

11:21.286 --> 11:23.530
Yeah, but I thought it was just
something you say, like a euphemism.

11:23.568 --> 11:24.421
A euphemism for what?

11:24.435 --> 11:25.942
A euphemism for "I'm
ordering a pizza."

11:25.977 --> 11:27.501
Come on, sit, sit.

11:27.636 --> 11:29.513
So, how was your trip?

11:29.527 --> 11:32.383
Oh, no.
First, a glass of wine --

11:32.397 --> 11:34.771
we went to the chateau du
Nozet in the Loire valley,

11:34.785 --> 11:36.550
and this is Pouilly fumé.

11:36.566 --> 11:38.842
It's supposed to be one
of the best in the land,

11:38.855 --> 11:41.880
and after trying 10 varietals--
note the use of "varietal"...

11:41.896 --> 11:42.533
Noted.

11:42.547 --> 11:44.451
...believe me,
you tend to believe them.

11:44.467 --> 11:46.793
We were drunk by the end of the tour.
We bought a case.

11:46.808 --> 11:49.632
Cool. So you went to a winery?
What else. What else did you do?

11:50.738 --> 11:52.630
Um, here.

11:52.647 --> 11:54.521
Try a snail.

11:54.537 --> 11:55.702
Uh, no.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.281
Please? Come on. I made them.

11:57.295 --> 11:58.032
You try one.

11:58.048 --> 12:00.332
I'm full.
I've been snacking on them all day.

12:00.348 --> 12:03.413
Well, see, I had a lunch of bugs
and lizards, so I'm good, too.

12:03.428 --> 12:05.322
All right, I'll try one.

12:05.567 --> 12:07.342
You sure you don't want
a lime and some salt

12:07.358 --> 12:09.132
so you can do it
like a tequila shot?

12:09.145 --> 12:10.683
I'm good.

12:10.698 --> 12:12.023
All right, you ready?

12:12.036 --> 12:14.361
One, two...

12:16.218 --> 12:18.440
- Well, how's it taste?
- Well?

12:18.455 --> 12:19.980
Sort of like a
buttered gummi bear.

12:19.998 --> 12:21.060
Pass.

12:21.078 --> 12:23.733
So, whatelse?
Tell me -- France.

12:24.127 --> 12:26.532
Okay, here it is.

12:30.047 --> 12:33.551
While we were in France,
your dad and I --

12:33.756 --> 12:35.431
we got married.

12:36.895 --> 12:37.770
What?

12:37.785 --> 12:39.181
We got married.

12:39.395 --> 12:41.513
You got married married?

12:41.526 --> 12:43.850
- Married married.
- Really?

12:47.017 --> 12:49.392
Wow. Wow. Um...

12:49.635 --> 12:53.231
Hey, congratulations.
T-That's-- That's so great.

12:53.246 --> 12:55.132
Thanks. We're so excited.

12:55.486 --> 12:58.192
Um, how? When?

12:58.207 --> 12:59.973
Two days ago, in Giverny.

12:59.985 --> 13:01.660
It's a little town about
an hour outside Paris.

13:01.697 --> 13:04.851
It's where Monet had his studio,
where he painted the water lilies.

13:04.888 --> 13:07.410
Oh, so you guys just went
there to get married?

13:07.426 --> 13:11.361
Oh, no, we just went there to
walk around, to see the lilies.

13:11.378 --> 13:14.702
And, um,
then it started raining,

13:14.716 --> 13:17.701
and there was this little church,
and, uh...

13:17.715 --> 13:21.091
it was so beautiful,
and we were so happy,

13:21.108 --> 13:23.431
and we got married.

13:23.447 --> 13:24.653
Wow.

13:24.666 --> 13:27.132
The ceremony was in french,
so there's only a 90% chance

13:27.145 --> 13:28.943
that we're actually married.
There's a 10% chance

13:28.975 --> 13:31.873
we were issued a very
expensive dog licence.

13:32.458 --> 13:33.650
Wow.

13:34.225 --> 13:35.982
Wow. Um...

13:35.995 --> 13:38.820
Oh, I'm --
I'm so happy for you guys.

13:38.926 --> 13:39.993
Really?

13:40.008 --> 13:42.172
You know, we need champagne.
Do we have champagne?

13:42.187 --> 13:44.740
Uh, in the cooler in
the garage, maybe.

13:44.756 --> 13:46.950
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- Okay!

13:52.745 --> 13:53.900
Well?

13:55.186 --> 13:56.143
What?

13:56.157 --> 13:57.273
What do you think?

13:57.286 --> 13:58.763
Um, what do you mean?

13:58.775 --> 14:00.671
I mean, what do you think?

14:00.975 --> 14:02.910
I don't know, mom.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.303
I can't believe
that you did this.

14:05.317 --> 14:07.543
- You're mad?
- Yes, I'm mad.

14:07.558 --> 14:09.742
- Rory...
- Just stop, okay? Don't.

14:09.755 --> 14:11.620
- Okay, but --
- I can't do this right now.

14:11.638 --> 14:15.452
Because dad is about to come
back in here, and I just can't.

14:15.588 --> 14:16.982
Okay.

14:17.276 --> 14:20.491
Unfortunately, we went
all the way to France

14:20.508 --> 14:22.382
and didn't come back with
a bottle of champagne,

14:22.417 --> 14:25.233
so we're gonna have to make
do with California's finest.

14:25.245 --> 14:26.813
It's okay.

14:32.928 --> 14:35.973
And she showed me her ring,
this huge canary diamond.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.393
Looked like something 
Paris Hilton would wear.

14:38.406 --> 14:40.191
- Hey, you made it.
- I made it.

14:40.205 --> 14:41.231
You look beautiful.

14:41.247 --> 14:42.933
How was the diner?
Did your mom really make snails?

14:42.968 --> 14:45.152
Not only did she make snails,
she got married.

14:45.165 --> 14:47.000
- What?
- In France-- to my dad.

14:47.017 --> 14:48.102
- Wow.
- Yeah.

14:48.116 --> 14:49.530
- Wow!
- I know.

14:49.546 --> 14:50.700
How  do you feel about it?

14:50.716 --> 14:52.730
You mean besides really bad?

14:52.746 --> 14:54.002
Do you want a drink?

14:54.018 --> 14:55.410
No, I'm good for now.

14:55.425 --> 14:56.830
Let's go outside
and talk about it.

14:56.907 --> 14:59.362
No, I'm okay.
I mean, I will want to talk about it,

14:59.375 --> 15:00.800
but right now I'm
still processing.

15:00.816 --> 15:03.472
Well, it's a lot to process.
Don't feel like you have to stay

15:03.486 --> 15:04.960
- if you don't want to.
- Oh, no. I want to be here.

15:04.996 --> 15:06.632
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

15:06.646 --> 15:09.700
Little-known fact --
I am quite the compartmentalizer.

15:09.717 --> 15:12.551
In fact, I have a blister on my heel.
I've been ignoring it all evening.

15:12.588 --> 15:14.630
All right. Well, if you change your
mind, you want to talk about it...

15:14.668 --> 15:16.640
I'm fine. This is your night.

15:16.657 --> 15:17.682
So how can I help?

15:17.695 --> 15:19.813
Just be your charming,
blister-ignoring self.

15:19.826 --> 15:22.622
I can do that. So, who's here?
Or, rather, who's not here?

15:22.635 --> 15:24.040
We got a pretty
good turnout, huh?

15:24.058 --> 15:24.652
Yeah.

15:24.668 --> 15:26.420
All right, see that guy right there?
He's a Rockefeller.

15:26.455 --> 15:28.181
He doesn't like you to talk about
the fact that he's a Rockefeller,

15:28.215 --> 15:30.243
but we wants you to know he's a
Rockefeller, so if you talk to him,

15:30.275 --> 15:32.421
make sure he knows you know,
but don't say you know.

15:32.436 --> 15:34.500
I'm gonna try to work in
the phrase "Standard Oil."

15:34.515 --> 15:37.152
Behind us --
Boykin and his fiancée, Celery.

15:37.168 --> 15:39.041
And, no, I'm not kidding.
Those are their real names.

15:39.078 --> 15:42.401
"Meet my boyfriend, Boykin."
Try saying that five times fast.

15:42.456 --> 15:44.260
- Rory, you made it!
- Yeah.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.441
Hey.

15:45.967 --> 15:47.473
- Hey, Rory.
- Hi.

15:47.486 --> 15:49.692
Oh, you look beautiful,
absolutely beautiful.

15:49.708 --> 15:51.503
Careful, man, you're drooling.

15:51.515 --> 15:54.322
How are things at Yale? Only six months
until you're sprung free, right?

15:54.357 --> 15:56.781
Yeah. Don't remind me.
I'm so not ready to be sprung.

15:56.798 --> 15:58.661
Stop to be brilliant.
Can I get you a drink?

15:58.676 --> 16:00.201
- Oh, thanks.
- I'll be right back.

16:00.215 --> 16:02.433
- Hello, Rory, darling.
- Hi.

16:02.946 --> 16:06.070
I'm so happy you made it.
That dress is so cute.

16:06.088 --> 16:09.062
Oh, thanks.
Um, your dress is cute, too.

16:09.075 --> 16:10.212
Thank you, sweetheart.

16:10.225 --> 16:11.933
So, bit of exciting news--

16:11.945 --> 16:13.293
"Page Six" is here.

16:13.308 --> 16:14.431
Really?

16:14.448 --> 16:16.132
Wow. Congratulations.

16:16.146 --> 16:17.832
- It's all Bobbi.
- Oh, rubbish.

16:17.848 --> 16:21.303
Oh, before I forget, you sent a
case of champagne to Joe McMillan.

16:21.316 --> 16:22.801
His website's trash,
but we need him to write

16:22.837 --> 16:24.871
- something smashing about us.
- Sounds good.

16:24.885 --> 16:27.600
Oscar Schroeder's limo didn't show.
I've got to find him another one.

16:27.635 --> 16:30.523
The gentleman can't be expected
to walk three whole blocks.

16:31.037 --> 16:32.990
Ooh, Tripp Cavanaugh?

16:33.005 --> 16:35.261
Tripp! Hey, man,
glad you could make it.

16:35.275 --> 16:37.281
- Bobbi, you know Tripp.
- Hi, sweetheart.

16:37.686 --> 16:39.323
And this is my girlfriend,
Rory Gilmore.

16:39.337 --> 16:41.301
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

16:46.775 --> 16:48.373
Tripp's just back from Tortola.

16:48.385 --> 16:49.853
He's building an
incredible house there.

16:49.888 --> 16:50.772
Wow, congratulations.

16:50.788 --> 16:53.090
Well, we'll see. Construction
on the island is such a joke.

16:53.127 --> 16:55.250
I mean,
try getting anyone to meet a schedule.

16:55.267 --> 16:56.283
Yeah, I've heard that.

16:56.298 --> 16:58.120
Plus, my property's
totally isolated,

16:58.136 --> 16:59.390
which will be great once
the house is built,

16:59.426 --> 17:01.443
but it's a
construction nightmare.

17:01.458 --> 17:03.973
Turns out,
the bridge that accesses my land

17:03.988 --> 17:05.683
can't take the weight of the
truck carrying the supplies.

17:05.714 --> 17:08.001
We had to off-load the supplies
onto a smaller vehicle.

17:08.015 --> 17:09.563
That necessited
two fork-lifts.

17:09.576 --> 17:11.281
None of this is covered 
in the estimate, of course.

17:11.316 --> 17:12.181
It never is.

17:12.196 --> 17:15.161
Anyway, so we finally got
the materials -- finally.

17:15.178 --> 17:16.290
Oh, great.

17:16.308 --> 17:18.351
Yeah. Unfortunately,
that's when the real trouble began.

17:18.385 --> 17:21.041
Without consulting me, they decided
to move the pool over 10 feet

17:21.058 --> 17:23.163
'cause the excavation crew needed
more room for their equipment.

17:23.196 --> 17:24.272
Of course, I flip.

17:24.285 --> 17:27.119
Who ever heard of a pool right
in the middle of the backyard?

17:27.137 --> 17:28.711
Well, not me.

17:29.058 --> 17:31.570
I told them that was unacceptable
and they'd had to move.

17:31.585 --> 17:32.830
Can I get a picture
of you guys?

17:32.867 --> 17:34.190
Absolutely.

17:35.035 --> 17:36.643
I've got correct
names and spellings.

17:36.657 --> 17:38.470
- Where was I?
- Your pool.

17:38.485 --> 17:40.973
Oh right. So we shifted the
thing back 10 feet, thank God,

17:40.985 --> 17:42.643
but when they started
digging in the right place,

17:42.675 --> 17:44.423
we found out that
the soil in Tortola

17:44.435 --> 17:46.253
is far more porous than
we initially thought.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.440
- Oh, god.
- Bummer.

17:47.457 --> 17:49.453
Yeah, bummer, that's right.
So we had to lay down a drainage sysm.

17:49.486 --> 17:50.623
At least, that was the plan.

17:50.657 --> 17:53.542
But it turnes out that Tortola have
these building codes that specifically --

17:53.575 --> 17:55.072
Tripp, have you
met Natasha Wolfe?

17:55.088 --> 17:56.250
No, I don't think so.

17:56.268 --> 17:57.813
Oh, God, you have to meet her.

17:57.825 --> 17:59.740
She has a house in Tortola, as well.
Come come.

17:59.755 --> 18:01.063
- Oh, will you excuse me?
- Absolutely.

18:01.098 --> 18:02.543
Nice meeting you.

18:03.018 --> 18:04.892
Um, can we please
never go to Tortola?

18:04.907 --> 18:06.261
I don't even want to
meet John Turturro.

18:06.297 --> 18:07.470
Or eat tortellini.

18:07.486 --> 18:09.382
Hey, you'll actually
like this guy.

18:10.486 --> 18:11.552
Hugo.

18:11.567 --> 18:13.003
Logan. Hey. How you doing, man?

18:13.018 --> 18:14.983
Not too bad.
This is my girlfriend, Rory Gilmore.

18:14.997 --> 18:16.373
Hey, Hugo Grey,
nice to meet you.

18:16.386 --> 18:16.983
You too.

18:16.998 --> 18:19.602
Hugo spent two years working at the New
York Times, another couple at Slate,

18:19.635 --> 18:21.511
and then the Paris review
under George Plimpton.

18:21.545 --> 18:23.303
Wow. Did you just
worship at his feet?

18:23.317 --> 18:25.962
I tried, but he kept telling
me to get off the ground.

18:25.978 --> 18:28.683
Hugo's starting a new online 
magazine -- lots of buzz.

18:28.695 --> 18:30.953
- It could mean nothing.
- Could mean something.

18:30.965 --> 18:32.052
See why I like this guy?

18:32.065 --> 18:33.433
You don't have to convince me.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.462
Rory's the editor of
the Yale Daily News.

18:35.475 --> 18:39.081
I was the editor. I just abdicated my
throne-- or, rather, my swivel chair.

18:39.097 --> 18:40.122
That's impressive.

18:40.136 --> 18:41.801
Your drink --
sorry it got waylaid.

18:41.815 --> 18:43.620
I need your help, buddy.
Dan Cryer's about one drink away

18:43.655 --> 18:45.383
from hitting on
Jerrickson's wife.

18:45.395 --> 18:48.103
That would be bad. Excuse me.

18:48.125 --> 18:50.931
I'm gonna monopolize you a little
bit longer if you don't mind.

18:50.948 --> 18:53.441
Once you find somebody that can talk
about something other than stock quotes

18:53.476 --> 18:55.603
at one of these things,
you hold on for dear life.

18:55.618 --> 18:57.100
Oh God, I know what you mean.

18:57.115 --> 18:59.233
It's pretty different
from parties at Yale?

18:59.366 --> 19:01.870
Fewer drunken musing
on Roland Barthes.

19:01.885 --> 19:04.223
Although, on the plus side,
I am learning a great deal

19:04.236 --> 19:06.590
about the tackiness of
the canary diamond.

19:06.605 --> 19:08.472
They're not teaching
that these days?

19:08.485 --> 19:11.541
Tell me they at least have a
course in piloting the family jet.

19:11.556 --> 19:12.680
Sadly, no.

19:12.697 --> 19:15.671
Man. No wonder we're
falling behind the japanese.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.222
Is it the chinese now?

19:17.236 --> 19:19.170
We're definitely
falling behind someone.

19:19.185 --> 19:21.390
So, what kind of pieces
you write at Yale?

19:21.408 --> 19:23.800
A little bit of everything. That's
the great thing about being editor --

19:23.836 --> 19:25.711
you can pretty much give
yourself the best pieces.

19:25.748 --> 19:28.140
I got to interview Barack
Obama a couple weeks ago.

19:28.155 --> 19:30.070
- He came to speak at campus.
- Really?

19:30.085 --> 19:32.403
Did you ask your buddy Barack
if he's gonna run in 2008?

19:32.416 --> 19:34.720
What kind of journalist
would I be if I didn't?

19:34.738 --> 19:35.710
And?

19:35.725 --> 19:37.520
Standard answer --
"no current plans."

19:37.537 --> 19:38.991
But I saw a twinkle in his eye.

19:39.008 --> 19:40.510
Well, you can't
quote a twinkle.

19:40.527 --> 19:41.960
But you can describe it.

19:41.978 --> 19:43.612
Good point.

19:43.625 --> 19:45.563
Hey, listen. If you want to
submit something to my site,

19:45.595 --> 19:47.143
I'd be happy to
take a look at it.

19:47.158 --> 19:50.451
Really? Wow, that would be great.
What kind of pieces are you looking for?

19:50.465 --> 19:52.273
Cultural and
social observations.

19:52.288 --> 19:55.051
We're sort of Slate meets New
York Times' "lifestyle" section,

19:55.065 --> 19:56.693
before they sold out.

19:56.706 --> 19:58.200
You can definitely write
about a party like this.

19:58.235 --> 19:58.832
Really?

19:58.848 --> 20:00.970
I got Cryer talking golf --
disaster averted.

20:00.985 --> 20:02.243
Good job.

20:02.256 --> 20:04.072
I've got to take off, man.
I got an early morning.

20:04.106 --> 20:06.452
All right, man. Thanks a lot for
coming out. I really appreciated.

20:06.486 --> 20:07.680
No, thank you.
It was nice to meet you, Rory.

20:07.718 --> 20:09.752
- You too.
- And here's my card.

20:10.178 --> 20:11.052
- There you go.
- Thanks.

20:11.086 --> 20:12.440
- Bye, I'll see you guys around.
- Bye.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.412
Thanks. Look at you,
getting a card.

20:14.426 --> 20:16.313
I know. He said 
I should submit a piece for him,

20:16.345 --> 20:17.523
like something
about this party.

20:17.556 --> 20:18.620
Seriously? You have to do it.

20:18.658 --> 20:19.820
I know. I am.

20:19.835 --> 20:22.242
Logan, Rory,
I am so sorry I got pulled away.

20:22.258 --> 20:24.632
Natasha Wolfe actually has a house
on another one of the beef islands.

20:24.668 --> 20:28.492
Not Tortola. Still, she had an interesting 
experience when she was building...

20:28.808 --> 20:31.162
Okay, I'm just gonna leave
you one more message,

20:31.175 --> 20:33.703
and then I'm gonna
start sending telegrams.

20:35.936 --> 20:40.371
Honey, I know you think this
marriage was a big step, and...

20:41.057 --> 20:44.291
and it seems impulsive to you,
and we talked about going slow,

20:44.307 --> 20:47.020
and this seems like
the opposite of slow.

20:47.035 --> 20:48.690
And, in some ways, it is.

20:48.706 --> 20:52.170
And, in some ways,
it really isn't.

20:52.388 --> 20:55.640
And I really want to
talk to you about it.

20:56.148 --> 20:58.942
So, please, call me back...

20:59.415 --> 21:03.442
or respond to any of my
forthcoming telegrams.

21:03.995 --> 21:05.593
Okay. Bye-bye.

21:09.725 --> 21:11.691
I don't know,
I think the piece is good.

21:11.708 --> 21:14.193
I was just on a roll.
You know, I mean, I was hopped up.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.171
I couldn't sleep.
I was just way too excited,

21:16.185 --> 21:19.361
and I drank way too much coffee--
way too much coffee.

21:19.725 --> 21:22.800
Oh, I should really stop talking
and let you finish reading.

21:24.646 --> 21:25.993
One new message.

21:26.005 --> 21:28.253
Okay, I'm just gonna leave
you one more message --

21:32.187 --> 21:33.481
So...

21:35.897 --> 21:37.161
What do you think?

21:42.425 --> 21:43.963
I don't know what to say.

21:44.548 --> 21:47.333
Oh, I know the ending is a
little convoluted, but I --

21:47.348 --> 21:50.340
It's not convoluted.
You made your feelings perfectly clear.

21:50.545 --> 21:51.713
What do you mean?

21:51.728 --> 21:53.711
Just that it must have been
really hard for you at my party,

21:53.748 --> 21:56.020
surrounded by all those people with --
how do you put it?

21:56.036 --> 21:57.801
"Who can no more imagine a
world without trust funds

21:57.836 --> 21:59.980
than a world without water --
imported and bubbly, of course."

22:00.018 --> 22:01.763
Oh, no,
that was meant to be funny--

22:01.775 --> 22:03.362
It sounds like it was torturous,
being stuck there

22:03.395 --> 22:05.613
with "these overprivileged sons
and daughters of somebodies

22:05.645 --> 22:08.420
who fail to grasp how out of
touch they seem to those of us

22:08.436 --> 22:10.540
who don't have an errant
domestic employee

22:10.556 --> 22:12.910
or a construction
problem on beef island."

22:12.928 --> 22:14.872
- You're mad?
- You're damn right I'm mad.

22:14.887 --> 22:17.181
But you were making fun of
these people all night.

22:17.197 --> 22:19.562
I was joking. I wasn't standing
there judging everyone.

22:19.576 --> 22:20.900
I didn't judge everyone.

22:20.916 --> 22:23.312
The title of your article
is "Let them drink cosmos."

22:23.326 --> 22:24.951
I was joking around with my girlfriend.
I wasn't comparing

22:24.988 --> 22:27.020
a whole class of people
to Marie Antoinette.

22:27.037 --> 22:29.930
I'm so sorry. I really didn't
think that this would upset you.

22:29.945 --> 22:31.250
You didn't think
it would upset me?

22:31.288 --> 22:33.920
No. No, I was just writing.
I mean, I was worked up.

22:33.937 --> 22:36.961
I was mad at my mom. Maybe that
kind of got into the piece somehow.

22:36.976 --> 22:38.472
But, no,
this was meant to be funny.

22:38.486 --> 22:40.670
I didn't think you would
take it personally.

22:40.686 --> 22:42.462
I mean, you're totally
different from these people.

22:42.496 --> 22:44.432
No, I'm not, and you know what?
I don't want to be.

22:44.466 --> 22:45.170
Logan.

22:45.188 --> 22:47.760
What? I'm a rich trust-fund kid.
I'm not ashamed of it.

22:47.776 --> 22:50.480
No, and you shouldn't be.
That's not what I meant.

22:50.496 --> 22:52.732
I mean, my point,
or the point I was trying to make

22:52.746 --> 22:56.093
was that people use
connections to get ahead.

22:56.105 --> 22:58.842
Oh, give me a break. You act like making
connections is something nefarious.

22:58.875 --> 23:00.301
It's not.
It's just people meeting people.

23:00.338 --> 23:02.350
Well, it's certain people
meeting certain people.

23:02.367 --> 23:04.071
It's not like anyone's
meeting Joe bus driver.

23:04.107 --> 23:06.410
- And you're Joe bus driver.
- Well, no, but --

23:06.427 --> 23:09.401
Exactly. Where do you get off
acting all morally superior?

23:09.418 --> 23:11.861
That is not what I
intended to say at all.

23:11.877 --> 23:13.793
You clearly think you are. Why?

23:13.805 --> 23:16.813
Because you read "Ironweed"?
'Cause you saw "Norma Rae"?

23:16.825 --> 23:19.442
Wake up, whether you like it or not,
you're one of us.

23:19.455 --> 23:22.121
You went to prep school.
You go to Yale.

23:22.138 --> 23:24.903
Your grandparents are building a whole
damn astronomy building in your name.

23:24.935 --> 23:28.410
That is different, okay? It's not like
I live off a $5-million trust fund

23:28.425 --> 23:29.693
my parents set up for me.

23:29.708 --> 23:32.100
Well, you're not exactly
paying rent, either.

23:35.057 --> 23:36.943
Screw you, Logan.

23:42.477 --> 23:44.061
So, you're getting ready
for the party, huh?

23:44.097 --> 23:44.693
Yep.

23:44.706 --> 23:46.353
I can get you some
real wrapping paper.

23:46.367 --> 23:48.901
Did you not see "An
inconvenient truth"?

23:49.527 --> 23:50.823
Are you okay?

23:50.918 --> 23:53.251
Yeah, I just have a little stomachache,
that's all.

23:53.265 --> 23:56.031
Okay, what do you think? I put this
article on darfur on the front,

23:56.047 --> 23:58.541
to put things in perspective in
case Sabrina doesn't like the CD

23:58.575 --> 24:00.343
- that I picked out for her.
- It looks pretty good.

24:00.376 --> 24:03.550
So, I wanted to talk
to you about tonight.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.833
Hey, are you sure you're okay?
Maybe you should get something to eat.

24:06.866 --> 24:09.181
I'm not hungry.
Hand me the tape, please.

24:09.195 --> 24:10.833
Sweetie, you don't
look so good.

24:10.848 --> 24:12.813
That's not a nice thing to say
to someone who's on her way

24:12.848 --> 24:14.212
to her first boy-girl party.

24:14.228 --> 24:16.360
- Oh yeah. Sorry.
- Tape, please?

24:16.377 --> 24:17.943
So, look, about the party.

24:17.957 --> 24:18.912
Yeah?

24:18.926 --> 24:22.411
I want to talk to you about that thing
we were talking about the other night.

24:22.428 --> 24:24.402
I'm not gonna use
the "k" word, okay?

24:24.417 --> 24:27.642
Instead, I'll just
use "juggling," okay?

24:27.658 --> 24:29.350
- "Juggling"?
- Juggling.

24:29.366 --> 24:30.173
Okay.

24:30.187 --> 24:32.371
Okay, so here's the thing.

24:32.657 --> 24:36.461
Even if all the other
kids are juggling

24:36.477 --> 24:39.490
and you might feel like
you want to juggle, too,

24:39.507 --> 24:43.371
I don't think you should
juggle before you're ready.

24:43.386 --> 24:44.200
I know.

24:44.218 --> 24:46.131
And I don't think you're ready.

24:46.147 --> 24:47.431
How do you know?

24:47.447 --> 24:49.690
Well, let's put it this way.
I'm not ready.

24:49.807 --> 24:53.153
That seems kind of arbitrary,
since you're not the one doing it.

24:53.165 --> 24:54.690
Yeah, it may be, but, still,

24:54.705 --> 24:57.382
if I let you go to this party,
you have to promise me

24:57.397 --> 25:01.701
that you won't
juggle with boys.

25:01.718 --> 25:03.300
- Fine.
- "Fine"?

25:03.315 --> 25:05.162
Yes. Fine.

25:06.426 --> 25:07.782
Okay.

25:08.705 --> 25:11.161
Shoot, where'd I
put Sabrina's card?

25:11.577 --> 25:13.321
Oh, there it is.

25:14.705 --> 25:17.160
Hey, are you sure you're okay?

25:17.177 --> 25:18.991
- I feel fine.
- Come here, let me feel your forehead.

25:19.028 --> 25:20.742
I feel fine.

25:20.826 --> 25:22.920
April, you have a fever.

25:22.935 --> 25:24.223
I swear, dad, I feel fine.

25:24.237 --> 25:26.730
Yeah, you can't go to
the party if you're sick.

25:26.746 --> 25:28.782
- I'm not sick!
- Yeah, you are, sweetie.

25:28.797 --> 25:30.512
You're just saying that 'cause
you just don't want me to go!

25:30.546 --> 25:32.820
- That's not true.
- It is! You don't trust me!

25:32.835 --> 25:35.343
Of course I do.
Look, there will be other parties.

25:35.356 --> 25:37.430
- No!
- I'm sorry, April. You're sick.

25:37.448 --> 25:39.592
- I'm not!
- Yeah, you are, sweetie.

25:39.608 --> 25:41.321
- I can go!
- No, you can't.

25:41.335 --> 25:43.202
You suck as a dad!

25:51.056 --> 25:53.112
You have no messages.

25:53.186 --> 25:55.380
I think this is the
last of the clothes.

25:55.396 --> 25:56.320
Ah yeah?

25:56.337 --> 25:57.613
Aah! Come here. What is that?

25:57.627 --> 25:58.390
What?

25:58.836 --> 26:00.823
It's a shirt.
What's wrong with a shirt?

26:00.937 --> 26:02.763
Let's start with the color.
It's peach.

26:02.777 --> 26:03.982
I look good in peach.

26:03.998 --> 26:06.902
Exactly. Men who buy peach
shirts buy it 'cause they think

26:06.918 --> 26:08.803
they look good in peach, which
means they really thought about it,

26:08.835 --> 26:10.611
which means they're
obsessed with their looks!

26:10.648 --> 26:12.221
I'm not obsessed with my looks!

26:12.238 --> 26:15.003
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you a peach shirt.

26:15.017 --> 26:17.171
Oh, just leave my stuff alone.

26:17.186 --> 26:21.242
- Oh, my god, you dirty thief.
- Excuse me?

26:21.256 --> 26:24.302
You stinking, lying,
stinking, ratty, dirty thief!

26:24.317 --> 26:24.911
What?

26:24.925 --> 26:27.983
This is my Police
"Synchronicity" t-shirt.

26:27.996 --> 26:30.453
I have been missing
this for 22 years!

26:30.467 --> 26:32.012
I asked you if you had it!

26:32.026 --> 26:34.993
I looked you right in the face,
and you denied it!

26:35.108 --> 26:36.271
I lied.

26:36.286 --> 26:39.360
Oh, you lied! You lied!

26:39.457 --> 26:41.773
Do you know how long
I looked for this?!

26:41.788 --> 26:44.451
Days and days! And then I accused
my mother of throwing it out,

26:44.466 --> 26:46.241
and she said she didn't, and,
oh, my god, I hated her.

26:46.278 --> 26:48.230
Oh my god, I could have had the
best relationship with my mother

26:48.267 --> 26:49.852
if you hadn't stolen my shirt.

26:49.866 --> 26:52.421
Well, keep laughing, buddy,

26:52.438 --> 26:56.183
because, I'll tell you,
the laugh's on you now!

26:56.196 --> 26:58.373
You better get used
to seeing this shirt,

26:58.388 --> 27:01.532
because I have to make up for
22 years of not wearing it.

27:01.546 --> 27:02.602
Where do you think
you're going?

27:02.637 --> 27:04.772
I'm dropping this stuff
off in Rory's room.

27:04.785 --> 27:06.433
Actually, I guess
it's G.G.'S room now.

27:06.446 --> 27:08.132
Wow, that's weird, huh?

27:08.148 --> 27:09.460
Really weird.

27:09.577 --> 27:12.222
A big sellingpoint -- the proximity
of this room to the kitchen.

27:12.235 --> 27:14.411
I don't know why, but G.G.
was incredibly psyched about that.

27:14.448 --> 27:15.713
Why? You feed her, don't you?

27:15.727 --> 27:17.270
I knew there was something
I was forgetting.

27:17.285 --> 27:18.542
W-What are you doing?

27:18.556 --> 27:20.960
I'm juste seeing how heavy it is. I thought 
maybe we could move it in the garage,

27:20.995 --> 27:22.432
get G.G.'s coloring
table in here.

27:22.447 --> 27:24.561
Yes, or we could just
leave it right here.

27:24.575 --> 27:26.543
Nah, G.G.'s not gonna need
it for a couple years.

27:26.556 --> 27:27.722
Oh, you know what
I was thinking?

27:27.757 --> 27:29.033
- Trundle beds.
- Trundle beds?

27:29.046 --> 27:30.650
For when Rory comes to visit.

27:30.668 --> 27:33.050
Uh, okay. Wait.
I'm sorry. Slow down.

27:33.176 --> 27:34.333
Why?

27:36.575 --> 27:40.221
I just -- I don't want to change Rory's
room all around without consulting her.

27:40.235 --> 27:42.671
She's not gonna care. She's graduating
from college in the spring.

27:42.706 --> 27:45.000
Right, and lots of college
graduates end up back home,

27:45.017 --> 27:46.802
where they need their desks.

27:46.815 --> 27:47.563
Lor.

27:47.578 --> 27:49.440
What? I'm just being
realistic, okay?

27:49.458 --> 27:51.323
It's not like she's gonna be
an investment banker. You know.

27:51.357 --> 27:53.893
She's gonna be a journalist,
and journalists get paid crap.

27:53.907 --> 27:56.010
So, if she needs money,
we'll help her out.

27:56.027 --> 27:57.313
Right. Okay. That's fine.

27:57.328 --> 28:00.721
But, still, why not just 
leave Rory's room as it is?

28:00.735 --> 28:02.943
Give G.G.
something to aspire to.

28:02.956 --> 28:06.183
Things worked out pretty well for Rory.
I mean, she went to Yale.

28:07.315 --> 28:08.381
Lor...

28:09.018 --> 28:10.192
Chris?

28:10.567 --> 28:13.982
I know it's difficult,
but things around here are gonna change.

28:14.425 --> 28:16.052
You think I don't know that?

28:16.848 --> 28:18.482
I just, uh...

28:19.157 --> 28:22.420
I don't want Rory to feel like the
rug's being pulled out from under her,

28:22.437 --> 28:24.373
you know,
like she's being kicked out.

28:24.388 --> 28:25.730
Rory's gonna be fine.

28:25.747 --> 28:28.471
You don't know that.
She's already upset.

28:28.767 --> 28:30.181
About what?

28:31.946 --> 28:34.263
About you and me,
about the marriage.

28:34.385 --> 28:36.340
She seemed fine
when we told her.

28:36.357 --> 28:39.050
In front of you,
and then you left, and...

28:39.718 --> 28:41.673
...she told me she
was really upset.

28:41.685 --> 28:44.003
What? H-How could
you not tell me that?

28:44.098 --> 28:45.591
Well, honey, I --

28:45.608 --> 28:47.952
No, I'm her father, Lorelai.
We're married now.

28:47.968 --> 28:50.232
Okay, well,
I'm telling you now.

28:52.136 --> 28:53.740
Let's call her.
We should talk about it.

28:53.756 --> 28:55.213
- I did.
- And?

28:55.228 --> 28:58.541
And she's not
answering right now.

28:58.557 --> 29:01.620
But it'll be okay, you know?
It'll be fine. It's just --

29:01.636 --> 29:04.052
It's a sensitive thing,
and, uh...

29:04.066 --> 29:07.951
and I-I just feel like
we should give it time,

29:07.967 --> 29:10.483
you know, before 
we spring trundle beds on her.

29:11.787 --> 29:13.223
Yeah, okay.

29:13.848 --> 29:16.372
I mean,
she just needs time to adjust.

29:17.247 --> 29:19.503
- Okay.
- Okay?

29:22.638 --> 29:25.290
There's a few more things I
got to bring in from the car.

29:40.887 --> 29:43.193
He's the one who insisted
I move in with him.

29:43.208 --> 29:44.573
Begged me practically.

29:44.588 --> 29:47.630
And now he throws it back in my face,
like I'm some kind of leech.

29:47.647 --> 29:50.001
- That's such a low blow.
- So low.

29:50.016 --> 29:52.353
- I hate everyone today.
- Including us?

29:52.368 --> 29:55.173
Well no, not you guys,
but don't cross me, sister.

29:55.188 --> 29:56.801
Keep reading, Liv.

29:56.818 --> 29:59.840
I'm practically homeless.
I mean, obviously, I can't live there.

29:59.857 --> 30:01.202
You can move in with us.

30:01.216 --> 30:03.020
- Is that allowed?
- Well, not technically.

30:03.037 --> 30:05.351
But we have a hot plate, and we're
not allowed to have that either.

30:05.388 --> 30:07.501
Will you finish reading that
article so I can read it?

30:07.536 --> 30:08.823
Okay, okay.

30:08.837 --> 30:10.443
Seriously, Rory,
you should just move in here with us.

30:10.475 --> 30:13.603
We'll make a smaller common room.
We'll put up a temporary wall.

30:13.617 --> 30:14.853
You know how to do that?

30:14.866 --> 30:17.001
I don't,
but boyfriend's super handy.

30:17.016 --> 30:18.090
Oh, right.

30:18.107 --> 30:21.502
He put up those bookshelves, and
they're fine for, you know, paperbacks.

30:21.518 --> 30:23.250
You know what?
Don't worry about me.

30:23.265 --> 30:25.420
You guys are taking enough of
a risk with that hot plate.

30:25.455 --> 30:26.691
I will figure something out.

30:26.708 --> 30:27.762
Well, if you need to...

30:27.776 --> 30:28.993
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

30:29.005 --> 30:29.880
Here.

30:30.146 --> 30:31.890
So, what did you think?

30:31.906 --> 30:33.753
- It's a really great piece.
- You think?

30:33.765 --> 30:35.822
- Yeah, you're an awesome writer.
- Thanks.

30:35.835 --> 30:39.482
It was sharp and funny, and I could
totally see everything and
imagine everyone.

30:39.495 --> 30:41.301
Thanks. And it's
not mean, right?

30:41.317 --> 30:42.623
No, no, it's mean.

30:42.637 --> 30:45.150
Yeah, it is mean,
and I'm only on the first paragraph.

30:45.168 --> 30:46.540
Keep reading,
it get's meaner.

30:46.558 --> 30:47.531
It's mean?

30:47.545 --> 30:49.632
Sort of Lynn Hirshberg meets --

30:49.646 --> 30:50.950
I don't know,
someone really mean.

30:50.985 --> 30:53.853
What? No!
No, I'm Fran Lebowitz.

30:53.867 --> 30:55.901
It's supposed to
be fun, frothy,

30:55.916 --> 30:58.592
lighthearted satire,
social anthropology.

30:58.607 --> 30:59.803
I'm Tama Janowitz.

30:59.815 --> 31:01.633
A mean Tama Janowitz.

31:01.646 --> 31:04.132
Oh, god. I'm mean?

31:04.148 --> 31:07.092
I'm mean and judgmental,
and I didn't even mean to be.

31:07.106 --> 31:09.841
I was just trying to sell an article.
No wonder he's upset.

31:09.858 --> 31:12.340
Come on! He knows you.
It wasn't intentional.

31:12.357 --> 31:14.451
That's worse!
I didn't even mean to be mean,

31:14.468 --> 31:17.430
and I was mean.
Mean and judgmental and insensitive.

31:17.446 --> 31:20.252
I really do hate everyone today,
including myself.

31:20.268 --> 31:22.640
Great. The circle's complete.

31:23.986 --> 31:26.422
You sure you don't want some ginger ale?
It'll settle your stomach.

31:26.458 --> 31:29.732
- I feel fine.
- Okay.

31:30.127 --> 31:32.353
How about a movie?
I could rent us a movie.

31:32.637 --> 31:36.362
Come on, April.
Look, I know you're a little upset.

31:36.377 --> 31:39.511
But, I promise you,
there will be other parties.

31:39.948 --> 31:42.240
Come on, talk to me.

31:46.038 --> 31:48.540
Wow! Okay,
you're really hot, sweetie.

31:48.557 --> 31:50.543
Hang on a minute.

32:02.177 --> 32:03.132
Hello?

32:03.148 --> 32:04.770
April's really sick,
and I don't know what to do.

32:04.807 --> 32:07.483
She's got a fever, and it's her stomach.
And she's really pale, so--

32:07.515 --> 32:09.133
Okay. Slow down.
Did she throw up?

32:09.148 --> 32:09.740
No.

32:09.758 --> 32:10.903
Did she eat something bad?

32:10.916 --> 32:12.663
No, she hasn't eaten
anything all day.

32:12.676 --> 32:14.192
Aw, where does it hurt?

32:14.207 --> 32:16.500
- She's holding her side.
- Which side?

32:16.518 --> 32:18.582
Her right side.
It seems to be getting worse.

32:18.598 --> 32:21.232
Oh, you know,
it could be appendicitis.

32:21.248 --> 32:23.122
Appendicitis-- Really?

32:23.136 --> 32:26.382
Yeah, it's gonna be okay, but you should
take her right to the hospital, okay?

32:26.395 --> 32:28.920
- Take her to St. Joseph's.
- Okay. Okay.

32:32.515 --> 32:34.620
- We have five minutes left.
- No, we don't.

32:34.636 --> 32:36.623
I checked my watch
before I fed the meter.

32:36.636 --> 32:37.480
So did I.

32:37.498 --> 32:39.180
You couldn't have.
Because we've got five minutes left.

32:39.215 --> 32:40.223
No.

32:40.238 --> 32:42.570
Five minutes have passed since you
started this inane conversation.

32:42.605 --> 32:45.440
So if I were you, I'd put another
quarter in and call it a day!

32:45.775 --> 32:47.632
You need to check
your watch battery.

32:47.646 --> 32:50.473
This is a quartz Timex.
You wind it.

32:54.117 --> 32:55.160
Hey.

32:55.177 --> 32:56.890
- Oh, hey.
- How is she?

32:56.908 --> 32:59.693
Okay. It was appendicitis,
like you said.

32:59.707 --> 33:01.732
But she's okay.

33:01.745 --> 33:03.470
The operation went
really great.

33:03.486 --> 33:06.230
They got it out, no problem.
And she's gonna be fine.

33:06.246 --> 33:07.722
And I'm gonna be able
to see her pretty soon.

33:07.758 --> 33:09.760
- Good, good.
- Yeah.

33:09.775 --> 33:12.471
You didn't --
you know you didn't have to come,

33:12.488 --> 33:14.443
but thanks for coming.

33:14.458 --> 33:16.801
There's nothing worse than taking
your kid to the emergency room.

33:16.835 --> 33:20.171
You know,
I remember Rory had food poisoning,

33:20.186 --> 33:21.702
and they had to hook
her up to an I.V.

33:21.715 --> 33:24.993
and she just looked
so little and scared.

33:25.037 --> 33:28.121
It made me feel like they were
gonna have to hook me up to an I.V.

33:28.135 --> 33:30.613
Yeah, I was almost out of my mind,
I was so scared.

33:30.626 --> 33:32.092
At one point,
I got so panicked,

33:32.107 --> 33:33.843
I was thinking maybe I'd
give her my appendix,

33:33.877 --> 33:36.713
if they could do some kind of
a transplant or something.

33:36.727 --> 33:39.183
But I was a little
out of my mind.

33:39.195 --> 33:42.041
- Well, I'm glad she's gonna be okay.
- Yeah, she's gonna be all right.

33:42.058 --> 33:43.520
Mr. And Mrs. Nardini?

33:43.535 --> 33:45.950
Oh, no. Hi, I'm Luke Danes.
I'm April's dad.

33:45.965 --> 33:48.042
Well, she's a little
out of it right now,

33:48.055 --> 33:49.703
but you and your wife
can go in and see her.

33:49.735 --> 33:52.333
- No, she's not my...
- No, I'm not, uh...

33:53.228 --> 33:56.370
Oh. Sorry. I just assumed.

33:58.347 --> 34:01.260
So, would both of you
like to go in and...

34:01.276 --> 34:02.491
- I'll just...
- You go.

34:03.418 --> 34:04.392
- Okay.
- Okay.

34:04.408 --> 34:05.312
Bye.

34:12.357 --> 34:14.223
Trust me. Don't call him today.

34:14.487 --> 34:16.431
He's going to put
his money down.

34:16.447 --> 34:18.092
He just doesn't like
the aggressive stuff.

34:18.127 --> 34:21.503
We have to sit back,
relax, let him come to us.

34:21.516 --> 34:23.952
If we don't hear from him in a week,
then we panic.

34:25.306 --> 34:27.812
Yeah. Nick,
I got to call you back.

34:27.826 --> 34:29.252
All right. Bye.

34:29.667 --> 34:30.972
Sorry.

34:31.197 --> 34:32.723
I hope it's okay that I'm here.

34:32.735 --> 34:34.342
Hey, it's your apartment.

34:34.358 --> 34:38.222
Rory... I'm so
sorry I said that.

34:38.235 --> 34:39.679
Yeah, well...

34:39.696 --> 34:42.092
I was way out of line.
I just...

34:42.107 --> 34:45.522
I love it that you're here. You know
that I love it that you're here.

34:45.795 --> 34:47.752
Yeah. No, I know.

34:47.766 --> 34:49.572
I was just upset.

34:49.614 --> 34:53.451
Well, you had every right to be.
That article was awful.

34:53.467 --> 34:55.371
- It wasn't awful.
- It was awful.

34:55.387 --> 34:58.031
And mean and judgmental,
as you said.

34:58.158 --> 35:00.511
I just--
I don't even know why I didn't see that

35:00.527 --> 35:02.971
or what I was thinking,
except that maybe I wasn't thinking.

35:02.985 --> 35:05.271
- Look, it's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

35:05.286 --> 35:07.300
I was just trying to
write a clever article,

35:07.316 --> 35:08.923
and I didn't mean to upset you,

35:08.937 --> 35:11.383
but I should have thought about it.
I should have known.

35:11.395 --> 35:12.870
But if that's the
way you feel...

35:12.886 --> 35:15.063
But that's just it.
It's not the way I feel.

35:15.078 --> 35:17.261
You don't have to approve
of everything I do.

35:17.277 --> 35:18.981
I know that, but I actually do.

35:18.997 --> 35:22.192
I mean, I have total respect for
everything that you're doing.

35:22.208 --> 35:23.641
I'm so proud of you.

35:23.656 --> 35:24.752
I know you are.

35:24.766 --> 35:26.743
Do you?
Because I really need you to know that.

35:26.757 --> 35:27.700
I really know that.

35:27.716 --> 35:30.073
- Because I really am.
- I know.

35:30.086 --> 35:31.603
- Promise?
- I promise.

35:31.617 --> 35:34.742
And look, the truth is, I wouldn't be so
upset if you weren't such a good writer.

35:34.777 --> 35:37.760
I mean, talk about the pen being
mightier than the sword. It's true.

35:37.775 --> 35:39.390
That pen of yours
is a howitzer.

35:39.406 --> 35:40.672
You don't have to say that.

35:40.687 --> 35:42.443
I wouldn't if it wasn't true.

35:42.457 --> 35:44.432
Can we talk about something
besides the article?

35:44.446 --> 35:46.943
You got to compliment me.
Let me compliment you.

35:46.956 --> 35:49.543
- We're complimenting each other now?
- If you'll let me.

35:49.955 --> 35:51.670
I guess that's okay.

35:52.358 --> 35:54.333
You're a really
great writer, Ace.

35:54.346 --> 35:55.812
You have great hair.

35:55.826 --> 35:58.430
You've got awesome teeth.
I've always admired your teeth.

35:58.447 --> 35:59.531
Really? I never knew.

35:59.548 --> 36:01.473
Yep, particularly
the bottom ones.

36:01.485 --> 36:02.762
I love you so much.

36:02.775 --> 36:04.253
I love you, too.

36:07.566 --> 36:11.320
Um, but here's the thing.
I have to move out of this apartment.

36:11.476 --> 36:14.011
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

36:14.026 --> 36:16.453
I always thought that you
would come back and live here.

36:16.466 --> 36:19.813
But now that you're getting your own
place nearby, it's just different.

36:19.827 --> 36:21.792
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

36:21.806 --> 36:24.710
It's just something
I have to do for me.

36:24.865 --> 36:28.291
But you should know that I
plan on taking Henry with me.

36:32.238 --> 36:34.943
You'll have to take that up with him.
You did insult him earlier.

36:34.955 --> 36:36.813
Did I? Hmm.

36:38.915 --> 36:40.863
- Hey.
- Hi. I'm sorry.

36:40.876 --> 36:43.602
I would have buzzed up,
but I saw a delivery guy coming in,

36:43.618 --> 36:45.582
so I slipped in with him.

36:45.595 --> 36:48.272
Boy, they sure do
eat well over in 4-F.

36:48.285 --> 36:50.233
- Can I come in?
- Oh, yeah. Sure. Come on in.

36:53.177 --> 36:54.561
What are you doing here?

36:54.666 --> 36:57.803
Well, I just--
I wanted to see you.

36:58.497 --> 37:00.930
Look, I got to run out and
take care of a few things.

37:00.946 --> 37:03.070
- Good to see you, Lorelai.
- Thanks. Good to see you.

37:09.028 --> 37:11.232
I'm guessing your
cellphone's not broken, huh?

37:11.246 --> 37:12.950
I just didn't feel
much like talking.

37:12.966 --> 37:14.971
I know.
Look, I know you're upset.

37:14.988 --> 37:17.793
I know this seems sudden and
like we didn't think it through.

37:17.805 --> 37:19.711
And in a way, it was impulsive.

37:19.728 --> 37:23.140
But in other ways,
it's been 20 years in the making.

37:23.157 --> 37:26.342
That's not why I'm upset.
I'm glad you're married.

37:26.418 --> 37:30.382
- You're glad?
- Yes, I'm -- I'm happy for you.

37:30.397 --> 37:31.911
It's wonderful.

37:31.926 --> 37:33.322
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:33.338 --> 37:34.950
You're great together.
You love each other.

37:34.985 --> 37:37.671
I mean, it's every kid's dream, right?
Parents get back together.

37:37.686 --> 37:39.540
But I wasn't there.

37:40.098 --> 37:41.742
You weren't there.

37:41.756 --> 37:43.961
I should have been there
when you got married.

37:43.978 --> 37:45.732
Yes, you should
have been there.

37:45.747 --> 37:47.852
I mean, how would you feel if I
got married and you weren't there?

37:47.887 --> 37:50.242
- Awful. I would feel awful.
- I feel awful.

37:50.255 --> 37:52.371
Look, I'm sorry. You know, I --

37:52.385 --> 37:53.960
Of course I wanted
you to be there.

37:53.978 --> 37:56.350
I could have been there. All you
had to do was make one phone call.

37:56.385 --> 37:58.243
You could have picked up the
phone and said, "come to Paris,"

37:58.275 --> 38:00.843
- and I would have come to Paris.
- I know that and I did.

38:00.858 --> 38:02.783
I wanted to call you.

38:02.795 --> 38:06.042
But then I thought,
if I called you,

38:06.057 --> 38:09.523
then you'd want to talk about it,
and I'd have to explain.

38:09.535 --> 38:13.112
And then maybe I would
talk myself out of it.

38:13.125 --> 38:15.633
I mean, after everything that
happened with the engagement,

38:15.645 --> 38:18.143
I didn't want a debate.
I didn't want to explain.

38:18.155 --> 38:21.181
I just wanted to do it,
because I am so certain, Rory.

38:21.198 --> 38:24.331
I'm so certain that
this is right.

38:24.347 --> 38:26.463
I really wanted to be
married to your dad,

38:26.475 --> 38:30.711
and I didn't want to talk my way
out of it. I just wanted to do it.

38:30.727 --> 38:32.282
I wouldn't have
tried to stop you.

38:32.297 --> 38:34.012
I wouldn't have tried
to talk you out of it.

38:34.047 --> 38:35.560
- No?
- No.

38:35.576 --> 38:37.382
I mean,
the only thing I might have said

38:37.395 --> 38:40.280
is maybe you guys would want to come
back to the States to get married

38:40.297 --> 38:42.983
so you could have some close friends
there, like Sookie and Jackson,

38:43.017 --> 38:45.020
maybe grandma and grandpa, G.G.

38:45.037 --> 38:48.031
Or maybe you would have wanted
to live together for a while,

38:48.045 --> 38:50.702
like six months,
just to try it out.

38:50.816 --> 38:53.172
Yeah, I totally would have
talked you out of it.

38:53.656 --> 38:55.372
Oh, I'm sorry.

38:55.386 --> 38:59.022
No, don't be sorry. I mean,
I'm really happy for you and dad.

38:59.037 --> 39:00.623
It's amazing.

39:00.856 --> 39:02.571
It is amazing.

39:02.917 --> 39:04.140
You're married.

39:04.156 --> 39:05.410
I know.

39:05.476 --> 39:07.411
- It's big.
- It's big.

39:07.547 --> 39:09.013
It's a big change.

39:09.027 --> 39:11.370
But nothing's gonna change
between you and me.

39:11.387 --> 39:13.003
I don't want you to feel weird.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.190
Okay.

39:14.207 --> 39:18.092
Of course, your dad is gonna put
flat-screen TVs in every room in
the house,

39:18.105 --> 39:19.930
but your house is
still your house.

39:19.948 --> 39:21.711
Your room is still your room,

39:21.728 --> 39:24.641
though we did talk about putting
a trundle bed in for G.G.,

39:24.656 --> 39:27.191
so it'd kind of be your room and
G.G.'s room. We don't have to do that.

39:27.225 --> 39:29.382
- No, I'm down with a trundle bed.
- You are?

39:29.398 --> 39:31.072
Yeah, I love a good trundle.

39:31.088 --> 39:32.740
I'll trundle it up with G.G.

39:32.895 --> 39:34.760
Hey, you didn't take dad's name,
did you?

39:34.775 --> 39:36.750
No. No. "Hayden"? No.

39:36.768 --> 39:40.311
I don't want to be Mrs. Hayden
planetarium for the rest of my life.

39:40.326 --> 39:42.441
I'm Lorelai Gilmore, okay?

39:42.456 --> 39:46.111
Lorelai Gilmore without
the "Gilmore" is like...

39:46.247 --> 39:48.911
Gil, you know, less.

39:49.247 --> 39:50.633
Okay.

40:05.855 --> 40:07.942
- What ya doin'?
- Hey. I'm sorry.

40:07.958 --> 40:10.051
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you up.

40:10.066 --> 40:13.172
You probably shouldn't be moving
furniture around at midnight, then.

40:13.187 --> 40:14.721
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

40:14.735 --> 40:16.650
- When did you get back?
- Half an hour ago.

40:16.666 --> 40:17.661
How's April?

40:17.676 --> 40:19.593
She's appendix-less,
but she's gonna be okay.

40:19.608 --> 40:20.303
Good.

40:20.316 --> 40:21.703
I saw Luke.

40:21.716 --> 40:24.181
- Was it okay?
- It was fine.

40:24.215 --> 40:26.541
Good. It's good you went over.

40:26.557 --> 40:27.780
But then I went to see Rory.

40:27.797 --> 40:28.573
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

40:28.588 --> 40:30.331
- How is she?
- She's good.

40:30.348 --> 40:32.123
- We talked, and she's good.
- Good.

40:32.138 --> 40:33.680
And she's really happy
that we're married.

40:33.716 --> 40:35.182
I knew she would be.

40:40.416 --> 40:42.493
Hey, I was thinking
about the room.

40:42.508 --> 40:46.111
And I was thinking we should paint it,
and we should let G.G. pick the color.

40:46.126 --> 40:48.923
- She's gonna pick pink.
- Pink would be great in here.

40:48.938 --> 40:50.022
Come on,
help me moves this out.

40:50.057 --> 40:51.201
Okay.

40:53.578 --> 40:57.030
Hey, so I was upstairs.
I got an idea.

40:57.198 --> 41:00.043
How about a flat-screen
in the bedroom?

41:00.057 --> 41:00.981
The bedroom?

41:00.998 --> 41:02.041
- Come on.
- No!

41:02.057 --> 41:03.392
Think about it!

41:07.586 --> 41:09.533
Let's take a look at the
national weather map and see

41:09.567 --> 41:11.310
what's in store for the
country over the next f--

41:11.346 --> 41:14.510
The biggest males
weigh over half a ton.

41:14.626 --> 41:18.121
And they're tall enough,
at 10 feet, to see forever.

41:18.746 --> 41:22.830
The russian brown bear is
identical to our grizzly --

41:22.847 --> 41:25.310
ursus arctos horribilis,

41:25.327 --> 41:27.511
"the horrible bear."

41:27.607 --> 41:30.671
Are your closets and drawers so
cluttered you can't find a thing?

41:30.685 --> 41:33.121
The killings were the
latest in a series --

41:33.138 --> 41:36.550
"Tow years ago, I did you out of a wedding 
in this house by eloping to Maryland."

41:36.568 --> 41:39.962
Two years ago,
you were invited to a wedding--

41:39.978 --> 41:41.552
Just a loan.

41:41.567 --> 41:43.213
- Put this in your vest pocket.
- Don't have a vest.

41:43.227 --> 41:44.912
Then hold it in your hand.

41:45.686 --> 41:48.450
- "Which was very bad manners."
- Which was very bad manners.

41:48.466 --> 41:51.270
"But I hope to make it up to you by going
 through with it now as originally planned."

41:51.316 --> 41:53.311
But I hope to make
it up to you by --

41:54.868 --> 41:58.463
By going beautifully
through with it now...
