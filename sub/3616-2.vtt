WEBVTT

00:05.880 --> 00:07.960
OK, TURN LEFT UP HERE,AND CAN YOU STEP
ON THE GAS A LITTLE?

00:08.800 --> 00:10.800
[GASPS] OHH.

00:12.120 --> 00:14.120
HEY!

00:15.280 --> 00:16.100
OFF THE GAS!
OFF THE GAS!

00:16.200 --> 00:17.380
DOES SOMEONE ELSE
WANT TO DRIVE HERE?

00:17.480 --> 00:18.700
PHOEBE, THE DEMON
IS NOT WAITING AROUND

00:18.800 --> 00:20.540
FOR US TO COME
AND VANQUISH HIM.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.140
WE DON'T HAVE THE POWER
TO VANQUISH HIM.

00:22.240 --> 00:24.540
SCRYING FOR RANDOM EVIL
TELLS US NOTHING.

00:24.640 --> 00:27.100
IT TELL US
WHERE THE DEMONS ARE,

00:27.200 --> 00:28.380
AND SINCE WE VANQUISHED
2 ALREADY THIS WEEK,

00:28.480 --> 00:30.020
I'D SAY IT'S
WORKING PRETTY WELL.

00:30.120 --> 00:31.380
THANKS TO COLE
FOR SAVING OUR BUTTS,

00:31.480 --> 00:33.980
BUT 2 WITCHES
AND A HALF A DEMON

00:34.080 --> 00:35.380
DOES NOT THE POWER
OF THREE MAKE.

00:35.480 --> 00:38.380
WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO, JUST SIT AROUND

00:38.480 --> 00:39.420
AND WAIT FOR THEM
TO PICK US ALL OFF?

00:39.520 --> 00:41.220
IF WE WEREN'T
GOING AFTER THEM,

00:41.320 --> 00:42.380
THEY'D BE COMING AFTER US.

00:42.480 --> 00:44.340
THEY'RE COMING
AFTER YOU
ANYWAY, PIPER.

00:44.440 --> 00:45.740
THE SOURCE IS
COMING AFTER YOU.

00:45.840 --> 00:47.140
AND WE WON'T BE
READY FOR HIM

00:47.240 --> 00:48.440
BECAUSE INSTEAD OF TEACHING
PAIGE HOW TO BE A WITCH,

00:48.520 --> 00:50.900
WE'RE OUT HUNTING DOWN

00:51.000 --> 00:52.380
EVERY TOM, DICK, AND
BEELZEBUB IN SAN FRANCISCO.

00:52.480 --> 00:56.220
SPEAKING OF,
DO WE HAVE ANY KIND
OF PLAN HERE, OR--

00:56.320 --> 00:57.780
THE PLAN IS
TO VANQUISH THE DEMON.

00:57.880 --> 00:59.220
GREAT. ANY CHANCE YOU'VE
MASTERED YOUR POWERS,

00:59.320 --> 01:00.440
OR ARE YOU STILL FREEZING
AND EXPLODING AT RANDOM?

01:00.520 --> 01:02.620
RANDOM, BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY,

01:02.720 --> 01:04.720
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE
FIELD PRACTICE. TURN HERE!

01:12.840 --> 01:16.040
STOP!

01:17.480 --> 01:20.480
HEY BIG SCRAY DEMOND!

01:21.640 --> 01:23.640
AAH!

01:25.560 --> 01:27.560
HE'S GONNA BLOW.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.960
WHAAH!

01:35.800 --> 01:39.000
NEXT!

03:01.240 --> 03:05.620
THROUGHOUT HISTORY, WITCHES
HAVE BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD,
PERSECUTED AND DESTROYED.

03:05.720 --> 03:09.380
THE PUBLIC HANGING, DROWNING
AND BURNING OF WOMEN

03:09.480 --> 03:11.940
SUSPECTED OF WITCHCRAFT IS
A FAR MORE RECENT CHAPTER

03:12.040 --> 03:14.340
OF OUR HISTORY THAN
PEOPLE REALIZE.

03:14.440 --> 03:16.380
PAIGE!

03:16.480 --> 03:18.480
YEAH?

03:18.960 --> 03:21.900
WHAT'S THE HOLDUP
ON THE O'BRIEN APPLICATION?

03:22.000 --> 03:24.160
WELL, AT THE MOMENT,
THE ONLY HOLDUP IS MY BOSS

03:25.080 --> 03:27.380
WHO'S STANDING OVER ME,
DISTRACTING ME FROM MY WORK.

03:27.480 --> 03:30.580
HEH, NICE TEETH.

03:30.680 --> 03:33.060
HAVE IT ON MY DESK
BY NOON.

03:33.160 --> 03:35.160
[WHISPERING] Lila!

03:36.480 --> 03:37.740
What's the O'Brien
application?

03:37.840 --> 03:40.300
ADAM O'BRIEN,
THE FOSTER KID

03:40.400 --> 03:42.340
WE'RE TRYING TO GET
INTO THE BOARDING SCHOOL?

03:42.440 --> 03:43.420
OH, MY GOD.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.300
THE SCHOLARSHIP APPLICATION
IS DUE, LIKE, TODAY.

03:45.400 --> 03:48.120
I AM SO LAME.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.840
AW, BILLY,
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU

03:53.480 --> 03:54.780
TO THROW ANYTHING
FRM CREDITORS
IN THE TRASH.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.960
HI, PIZZA-FACE,

03:57.680 --> 03:59.820
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS

03:59.920 --> 04:02.860
TO TEAR YOURSELF AWAY
FROM THE CLEAVAGE

04:02.960 --> 04:04.540
IN THIS SECTION,

04:04.640 --> 04:05.860
BUT I'M GONNA NEED
MY MAIL SOMETIME TODAY, OK?

04:05.960 --> 04:08.940
NO PROBLEM.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.040
GO, GO.

04:14.920 --> 04:18.200
NICE RUG.

04:20.279 --> 04:23.380
[GASPS]

04:23.480 --> 04:25.480
WHAT THE HELL!

04:32.520 --> 04:36.620
OH, I KNOW THAT YOU'RE HAPPY
THAT WE GOT HIM, PIPER,

04:36.720 --> 04:40.540
BUT IS IT ENTIRELY NECESSARY
TO DISFIGURE THE BOOK?

04:40.640 --> 04:43.340
HMM. THIS ONE COULD
INCINERATE HUMAN FLESH
WITH HIS EYES.

04:43.440 --> 04:46.380
THAT MUST STING.

04:46.480 --> 04:49.160
YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY?

04:50.240 --> 04:52.260
YOU COULD'VE
GOTTEN YOURSELF KILLED.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

04:52.360 --> 04:54.860
YES, COLE. I UNDERSTAND
KILLED VERY WELL.

04:54.960 --> 04:58.420
THEN WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO KEEP RISKING YOUR LIFE

04:58.520 --> 05:00.060
AND PHOEBE'S,
NOT TO MENTION MINE?

05:00.160 --> 05:02.100
THERE'S A LEGION OF
BOUNTY HUNTERS ON MY ASS.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.380
I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE LAYING LOW,

05:04.480 --> 05:05.440
BUT INSTEAD, I'M OUT
PROTECTING YOU GUYS.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.380
YOU KNOW WHAT, COLE?

05:07.480 --> 05:08.700
NEXT TIME,
YOU CAN STAY HOME.
[DOORBELL RINGS]

05:08.800 --> 05:10.540
IF YOU INSIST ON TAKING
THESE SUICIDE MISSIONS,

05:10.640 --> 05:13.260
YOU FORCE ME TO BE THERE
BECAUSE THERE'S
NO WAY IN HELL

05:13.360 --> 05:15.060
I AM ABOUT TO LET PHOEBE
LOSE ANOTHER SISTER.

05:15.160 --> 05:16.900
WHY DON'T YOU GO SEE WHO'S
AT THE DOOR FOR US, OK?

05:17.000 --> 05:19.380
SURE. IF IT'S
THE SOURCE,

05:19.480 --> 05:21.980
I'LL JUST ASK HIM
TO COME BACK LATER.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.280
WE NEED TO TALK.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.740
PIPER, COLE'S RIGHT.

05:31.840 --> 05:32.860
WE HAVE A SYSTEM
FOR FIGHTING DEMONS,

05:32.960 --> 05:34.660
AND IT'S WORKED
PRETTY WELL FOR
THE LAST 3 YEARS.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.740
I THINK, UH,
PRUE BEING KILLED

05:36.840 --> 05:39.380
COUNTS AS A PRETTY BIG
GLITCH IN THE SYSTEM.

05:39.480 --> 05:42.500
I KNOW
THAT YOU'RE ANGRY.
I AM ANGRY, TOO.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.060
THEN WHY ARE YOU
FIGHTING ME ON THIS?

05:45.160 --> 05:46.440
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH
GETTING A LITTLE PROACTIVE?

05:46.520 --> 05:48.980
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT
READY TO GET PROACTIVE.

05:49.080 --> 05:52.260
THAT'S WHAT'S
WRONG WITH IT.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.440
WE'RE BARELY READY
FOR ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.900
JUST DEALING WITH

05:56.000 --> 05:57.700
OUR EVERYDAY, NORMAL
LIVES IS HARD ENOUGH.

05:57.800 --> 06:00.140
THAT IS PRECISELY
THE POINT.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.460
THE FASTER WE
GET RID OF THESE DEMONS,

06:01.560 --> 06:03.180
THE FASTER WE CAN
GET BACK TO OUR EVERYDAY,
NORMAL LIVES,

06:03.280 --> 06:05.300
OR AT LEAST WHAT IS
LEFT OF THEM.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.180
KNOCK, KNOCK.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.520
I, UH, I'M SORRY
TO JUST DROP BY
WITHOUT CALLING.

06:12.240 --> 06:15.740
UH, IT'S OK.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

06:15.840 --> 06:17.420
I DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY WHY I'M HERE.

06:17.520 --> 06:20.220
I'M JUST KIND OF
HAVING A HARD TIME

06:20.320 --> 06:22.380
BEING SURROUNDED
BY PEOPLE AND...

06:22.480 --> 06:25.580
AND NOT BE ABLE
TO TELL THEM

06:25.680 --> 06:26.780
THAT YOU CAN MOVE THINGS
WITH YOUR MIND?

06:26.880 --> 06:29.340
IT DOES NOT EXACTLY
ROLL OFF THE TONGUE.

06:29.440 --> 06:32.540
YEAH, WELL, BEING A WITCH
IS TOUGH ON FRIENDSHIPS.

06:32.640 --> 06:35.340
THAT'S WHY
THE WHOLE SISTER THING
COMES IN SO HANDY.

06:35.440 --> 06:37.380
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:37.480 --> 06:38.460
UM, IT'S A LITTLE
CHATTY UP HERE,

06:38.560 --> 06:41.220
SO I'M GONNA GO SCRY
FOR EVIL IN MY ROOM.

06:41.320 --> 06:44.380
SCRY?

06:44.480 --> 06:45.780
YEAH, UH...

06:45.880 --> 06:48.460
PHOEBE'LL EXPLAIN.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.560
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.480
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A, UM...

06:54.920 --> 06:58.340
SUPERNATURAL LOJACK.

06:58.440 --> 06:59.780
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST USE THAT BIG BOOK?

06:59.880 --> 07:02.960
I MEAN, IT IS A BOOK
OF SPELLS, RIGHT?

07:03.360 --> 07:06.780
OH, IT'S A LOT MORE
THAN THAT.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.340
IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO EXPLAIN.

07:09.440 --> 07:10.860
IT LOOKS SO OLD.

07:10.960 --> 07:14.220
YEAH. IT HAS
SURVIVED A LOT.

07:14.320 --> 07:17.380
FORTUNATELY, IT PROTECTS
ITSELF FROM EVIL.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.380
IT PROTECTS ITSELF.
HOW?

07:20.480 --> 07:22.800
MAGIC.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.480
MAY I?

07:26.560 --> 07:27.460
YEAH.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.620
TECHNICALLY,
IT'S YOURS, TOO.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.340
I WOULD WALK YOU
THROUGH IT RIGHT NOW,

07:32.440 --> 07:34.580
BUT I HAVE TO GO
TALK TO COLE.

07:34.680 --> 07:37.100
WELL, MAYBE I CAN JUST
TAKE IT BACK TO MY OFFICE.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.660
OH, NO, NO, NO.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.660
NO, IT DOESN'T
LEAVE THE HOUSE.

07:40.760 --> 07:43.500
BUT JUST FEEL FREE
TO THUMB THROUGH IT.

07:43.600 --> 07:45.880
THEN I'LL BE BACK
IN A FEW MINUTES.

07:53.320 --> 07:56.920
THIS COULD SOLVE
A LOT OF PROBLEMS.

08:06.720 --> 08:10.380
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S WRONG?

08:10.480 --> 08:12.180
YOU'VE GOT TO TALK
TO YOUR WIFE.

08:12.280 --> 08:13.340
OK, COLE, REMEMBER
WHAT I SAID

08:13.440 --> 08:14.620
ABOUT BEING GENTLE?

08:14.720 --> 08:16.620
WHAT ABOUT MY WIFE?
SHE'S OUT OF CONTROL.

08:16.720 --> 08:18.780
COLE!
WHAT?

08:18.880 --> 08:21.220
IT'S JUST WE'RE VERY
WORRIED ABOUT HER.

08:21.320 --> 08:24.380
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:24.480 --> 08:25.500
SHE'S VERY, VERY ANGRY.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.420
WELL, OF COURSE
SHE'S ANGRY.
SHE'S GRIEVING.

08:27.520 --> 08:30.300
RIGHT. AND IF SHE
WERE PUNCHING WALLS,

08:30.400 --> 08:31.420
I WOULD HAPPILY CALL
A REPAIRMAN, BUT--

08:31.520 --> 08:33.980
THE PROBLEM IS,
SHE PREFERS
TO PUNCH DEMONS.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.080
I'LL TALK TO HER.

08:36.679 --> 08:38.299
SHE HAS NO REGARD
FOR HER OWN LIFE
OR FOR ANYONE ELSE'S.

08:38.400 --> 08:41.100
SHE'S CHARLES BRONSON
CUBED.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.500
I SAID
I'D TALK TO HER.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.780
GUYS, GUYS.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.880
WHO IS CHARLES BRONSON?

08:49.760 --> 08:53.480
NEVER MIND. CAN WE PLEASE
JUST HAVE A MINUTE ALONE?

08:54.080 --> 08:57.180
SURE.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.420
Phoebe: THANK YOU.

08:59.520 --> 09:01.520
OH, IT'S NOT JUST THAT
SHE'S VIOLENT, LEO.

09:02.680 --> 09:05.820
SHE'S ACTING
NOTHING LIKE HERSELF.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.280
SHE'S COMPLETELY
DISMISSIVE
OF PAIGE, AND...

09:09.320 --> 09:12.980
[SIGHS]
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO ANYMORE.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.220
IT'S STRANGE, ISN'T IT?

09:15.320 --> 09:17.700
NOW ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE,
YOU HAVE TO PLAY
THE "MIDDLE SISTER,"

09:17.800 --> 09:20.220
WHEN YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
THE, UH...

09:20.320 --> 09:23.380
THE SCREWUP?

09:23.480 --> 09:24.620
[LAUGHS]
THE YOUNGEST.

09:24.720 --> 09:27.420
YEAH, I LOOK
AT PAIGE AND PIPER,

09:27.520 --> 09:30.100
AND IT MAKES
ME THINK BACK

09:30.200 --> 09:31.440
TO ALL THOSE TIMES
THAT PIPER HAD
TO PLAY MEDIATOR

09:31.520 --> 09:33.460
BETWEEN ME AND PRUE.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.380
NOT A LOT OF FUN, HUH?

09:35.480 --> 09:37.620
IT'S NOT A JOB
I WOULD HAVE ASKED FOR,

09:37.720 --> 09:40.240
AND I'M NOT SURE
IT'S A JOB I'M GONNA
BE ANY GOOD AT, BUT...

09:41.920 --> 09:44.480
I JUST--I DON'T HAVE
TIME TO REALLY WORRY
ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.

09:46.080 --> 09:49.300
I'LL TALK TO HER.

09:49.400 --> 09:52.260
THANKS, LEO...

09:52.360 --> 09:55.460
AND NOT TO RUSH
THIS TENDER MOMENT,

09:55.560 --> 09:57.700
BUT SHE'S ALREADY
STARTED SCRYING.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.800
I DIDN'T MEAN
YOU COULDN'T USE
THE STAIRS.

10:19.800 --> 10:23.480
OK, BOOK.
PROTECT YOURSELF.

10:30.480 --> 10:33.600
[WHISTLES]

10:35.480 --> 10:39.100
OH!
WHOA! WHERE'S
THE FIRE?

10:39.200 --> 10:41.780
YOU KNOW, WORK.
LUNCH BREAK'S OVER.
GOTTA GO.

10:41.880 --> 10:44.380
WE DIDN'T EVEN
GET TO TALK.

10:44.480 --> 10:45.860
OH, YEAH. IT'S ALL RIGHT.
DON'T WORRY.

10:45.960 --> 10:48.780
WILL YOU COME BY LATER?

10:48.880 --> 10:50.880
SURE, YEAH,
ABSOLUTELY. BYE.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.560
BYE.

10:59.520 --> 11:03.300
IT ISN'T JUST
THAT IT'S DANGEROUS.

11:03.400 --> 11:06.140
LEO, WHITELIGHTERS
ARE SUPPOSED TO GUIDE,
NOT JUDGE.

11:06.240 --> 11:08.860
JUST BECAUSE I'M DOING THINGS
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY

11:08.960 --> 11:10.380
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.780
PIPER,
I'M YOUR HUSBAND,

11:12.880 --> 11:13.780
NOT JUST
YOUR WHITELIGHTER.

11:13.880 --> 11:15.700
WHEN YOU SPEAK
TO ME LIKE THAT,

11:15.800 --> 11:16.980
THERE IS A PROBLEM.

11:17.080 --> 11:18.300
I CAN'T
HELP YOU UNLESS
YOU TALK TO ME.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.800
IT HURTS TO TALK, LEO.

11:22.240 --> 11:25.460
IT HURTS TO BREATHE.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.380
SO UNLESS YOU HAVE
SOME IDEA OF HOW
TO BRING PRUE BACK,

11:28.480 --> 11:32.220
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK RIGHT NOW.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.480
IS THAT WHAT YOU
DON'T WANT TO SAY...

11:35.960 --> 11:38.380
IS THAT YOU STILL
BLAME ME

11:38.480 --> 11:39.940
FOR NOT BEING ABLE
TO BRING HER BACK?

11:40.040 --> 11:42.100
NO, LEO, I DON'T BLAME YOU.
I BLAME EVIL.

11:42.200 --> 11:45.780
WHY DO YOU THINK
I'M DOING ALL OF THIS,
FOR KICKS?

11:45.880 --> 11:49.380
HONESTLY, I THINK
YOU'RE DOING IT

11:49.480 --> 11:50.660
BECAUSE IT'S EASIER
THAN CONFRONTING

11:50.760 --> 11:52.760
WHAT YOU'RE
REALLY FEELING.

11:57.840 --> 12:01.100
DEMON.
WHAT?

12:01.200 --> 12:02.820
I HAVE WORK TO DO.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.920
COLE, PHOEBE, LET'S GO.

12:14.480 --> 12:18.160

ABOUT HIM, BILLY.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.380
HE'S A JERK
TO EVERYBODY.

12:34.480 --> 12:35.620
YEAH, I KNOW. THAT'S WHY
HIS MAIL GETS LOST.

12:35.720 --> 12:38.940
FREQUENTLY.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.040
HEY, IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THIS COPIER?

12:42.880 --> 12:44.740
THE COPIER?
I DON'T THINK SO.

12:44.840 --> 12:47.380
I JUST RAN OFF
A WHOLE BUNCH.

12:47.480 --> 12:49.480
ARE YOU TRYING
TO COPY A BOOK?

12:51.080 --> 12:54.340

TO DO IT FOR YOU,

A LITTLE HEAD RUSH.

14:09.800 --> 14:13.160

WELL, THE LAST TIME
I CHECKED,

MY SISTER,

PUTS HER ON MY SIDE.

WE'RE NOT ARGUING.
WE'RE DISCUSSING, PIPER.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.540
JUST BEFORE YOU
TURNED INTO BETTY BOOP?

22:44.640 --> 22:46.640
WELL, I CAST A SPELL
ON THIS SLIMEBALL

GIVE HIM A TASTE OF
HIS OWN MEDICINE.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.200
UH-HUH.
THAT THE SLIMEBALL?

22:54.560 --> 22:57.900
AND THAT'S THE BACKFIRE.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.540
BACKFIRE?

22:59.640 --> 23:00.920
YOU MISUSED MAGIC
TO MAKE HIM THE OBJECT
OF OGLING,

23:01.000 --> 23:04.060
AND THE SPELL BACKFIRED

23:04.160 --> 23:05.100
AND DID THE SAME THING
TO YOU.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.820
WHICH YOU WOULD'VE LEARNED
IF YOU HAD BOTHERED TO ASK.

23:06.920 --> 23:09.300
BUT NOW, INSTEAD OF
VANQUISHING DEMONS,

23:09.400 --> 23:10.980
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO SPEND THE AFTERNOON
FIXING YOUR MESS.

23:11.080 --> 23:13.240
OK, PIPER,
CALL LEO AND GET HIM

23:14.840 --> 23:16.860
TO ORB THIS SLIMEBALL
BACK HOME.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.540
WE HAVE TO PROTECT HIM
UNTIL WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY

23:19.640 --> 23:21.500
TO REVERSE THE SPELL.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.600
PAIGE AND I
WILL GRAB THE BOOK
AND MEET YOU THERE.

23:31.440 --> 23:35.220
ARE MY BOOBS GOING TO
STAY THIS WAY FOREVER?

23:35.320 --> 23:37.600
NOT IF I CAN EVER
FIND THE SPELL.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.460
WHAT ABOUT PIPER?

23:40.560 --> 23:41.900
SHE GONNA STAY
MAD AT ME FOREVER?

23:42.000 --> 23:44.160
NO. IT'S JUST, UM,
SHE HASN'T REALLY
BEEN HERSELF LATELY.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.300
A LOT OF UPS AND DOWNS

23:50.400 --> 23:52.900
SINCE PRUE,
YOU KNOW, LIKE US ALL.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.900
THE LAST THING
I WANTED TO DO

23:56.000 --> 23:57.020
WAS ADD TO
YOUR GUYS' STRESS.

23:57.120 --> 23:58.420
I JUST WANTED
TO GET BACK AT DONNIE.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.460
YEAH, AND I UNDERSTAND
THE TEMPTATION, PAIGE.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.340
I REALLY DO.

24:03.440 --> 24:04.780
BUT I TOLD YOU THE BOOK
DOES NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE.

24:04.880 --> 24:07.000
RIGHT. SORRY.

24:09.120 --> 24:12.820
CAN YOU PUT IT
INTO THIRD FOR ME?

24:12.920 --> 24:15.160
ALL RIGHT.
READY? HERE WE GO.

24:15.680 --> 24:18.000
ALL RIGHT.

24:18.960 --> 24:19.900
DID YOU FIND
THE SPELL YET?

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
NO, BUT I FOUND THE DEMONS.
OH, MY GOD.

24:23.320 --> 24:26.900
WHAT?
YOU CAN'T SAY "DEMONS,"

24:27.000 --> 24:28.060
FOLLOWED BY,
"OH, MY GOD."

24:28.160 --> 24:29.180
I'M NEW AT THIS.
I'M LIKELY TO PANIC.

24:29.280 --> 24:30.980
OK. UH, FURY SMOKE
KILLS BAD GUYS,

24:31.080 --> 24:34.920
BUT IN GOOD PEOPLE,
IT LOOKS FOR A PORTAL
OF UNEXPRESSED FURY.

24:36.560 --> 24:40.180
IT BUILDS UNTIL IT CONSUMES
YOUR HUMANITY,

24:40.280 --> 24:42.420
AND IT TURNS YOU
INTO A FURY.

24:42.520 --> 24:45.280
WE FOUGHT FURIES TODAY.
PIPER GOT SMOKED.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.900
WAIT.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.420
ARE YOU SAYING
THAT PIPER'S
TURNING INTO A DEMON?

24:51.520 --> 24:53.420
IT WOULDN'T BE
THE FIRST TIME.

24:53.520 --> 24:55.520
STEP ON IT
AND HIT THE CLUTCH.

24:56.600 --> 24:57.740
WE'RE GOING INTO FOURTH.
READY?

24:57.840 --> 24:59.840
ON 3. 1, 2, 3.

25:00.640 --> 25:02.640
UNH.

25:03.880 --> 25:05.260
EASY, PIPER.

25:05.360 --> 25:06.980
WHAT, ARE YOU
PROTECTING HIM NOW?

25:07.080 --> 25:08.580
WH-WH-WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON?

25:08.680 --> 25:10.260
AND WHAT'S WITH
ALL THESE CHICKS?

25:10.360 --> 25:11.100
THEY'VE GONE CRAZY.

25:11.200 --> 25:12.580
THIS CHICK
JUST SAVED YOUR ASS,

25:12.680 --> 25:14.820
YOU SNIVELING INGRATE.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.920
DO YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?

25:17.720 --> 25:18.900
WHO SAID
YOU COULD GET UP?

25:19.000 --> 25:21.420
UNH.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.260
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

25:23.360 --> 25:24.860
OK, HONEY, LOOK,

25:24.960 --> 25:26.940
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON,

25:27.040 --> 25:28.020
BUT WE REALLY NEED
TO TALK.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.120
LEO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SICK OF TALKING.

25:35.360 --> 25:38.900
NOW WE REALLY
NEED TO TALK.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.020
PIPER...

25:41.120 --> 25:42.900
DO NOT USE YOUR
POWERS ON A MORTAL.
DO YOU HEAR ME?

25:43.000 --> 25:45.440
Cole:
BACK AWAY SLOWLY, LEO.

25:46.280 --> 25:48.320
WHAT?

25:49.520 --> 25:51.520
SHE'S BECOMING A FURY.

25:52.320 --> 25:54.320
THERE'S NO REASONING
WITH HER NOW.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
PIPER, YOU'RE A GOOD WITCH.
DO YOU HEAR ME? FIGHT THIS.

26:07.720 --> 26:10.900
OH, GOD, HELP ME!

26:11.000 --> 26:13.200
UNH. UNH!

26:16.560 --> 26:19.920
Phoebe: COLE!

26:21.520 --> 26:24.840
THAT WASN'T VERY NICE.

26:36.160 --> 26:39.860
COLE HIT HER
WITH AN ENERGY BALL.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.940
LEO, IT WAS LOW-VOLTAGE.

26:42.040 --> 26:43.500
WOULD YOU PREFER HE'D
LET HER KILL AN INNOCENT?

26:43.600 --> 26:44.960
I PREFER THAT HE
WOULDN'T USE HIS DEMONIC
POWERS ON MY WIFE.

26:45.040 --> 26:48.220
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU LET HIM
GO LOOK FOR HER.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.740
OH, THIS IS ALL MY FAULT.

26:50.840 --> 26:52.100
I SHOULDN'T HAVE STOLEN
THE BOOK OF SHADOWS.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.060
YOU STOLE
THE BOOK OF SHADOWS?

26:54.160 --> 26:55.900
LEO? LEO,
CONCENTRATE, PLEASE.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.100
I JUST HOPE
HE FINDS HER FAST,

26:58.200 --> 27:00.660
BECAUSE IF THIS IS
ANYTHING LIKE THE TIME
I TURNED INTO A BANSHEE,

27:00.760 --> 27:02.660
SHE'S GONNA BE
HUNGRY FOR A KILL.

27:02.760 --> 27:03.820
I'M SORRY.
A BANSHEE?

27:03.920 --> 27:05.620
YEAH, DEMONIC SCREAMER,
KIND OF TRAMPY,
FEEDS ON PAIN.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.960
I THINK
I NEED TO SIT DOWN.

[GRUNTS]

27:17.400 --> 27:19.400
PAIGE!

27:20.160 --> 27:21.660
WHAT? YOU ONLY SAID
I COULDN'T USE MAGIC
TO PUNISH HIM.

27:21.760 --> 27:23.900
OK, LEO...

27:24.000 --> 27:25.660
YOU ORB DONNIE
BACK TO HIS OFFICE,
HEAL HIM THERE.

27:25.760 --> 27:28.860
THEN MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T
NARC US OUT FOR BEING WITCHES.

27:28.960 --> 27:30.580
HOW?

27:30.680 --> 27:31.900
I DON'T KNOW. BE CREATIVE.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.420
WHAT ABOUT PIPER?

27:33.520 --> 27:34.900
YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR JOB,
AND LET US DO OURS.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.200
WE'LL GET YOUR WIFE BACK.
I PROMISE.

27:44.240 --> 27:47.540
[PHOEBE SIGHS]

27:47.640 --> 27:48.900
UNH.

27:49.000 --> 27:49.940
UM, I HATE TO ASK,

27:50.040 --> 27:51.900
BUT HOW ARE WE GOING
TO GET HIS WIFE BACK?

27:52.000 --> 27:53.660
I MEAN, SHE'S KIND OF
A FULL-ON DEMON.

27:53.760 --> 27:56.900
NO, NOT FULL-ON.
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
THE TALONS YET.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.100
THEY PROBABLY COME
WITH HER FIRST KILL.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.220
BESIDES, IF WE WERE
ABLE TO SAVE HER

28:01.320 --> 28:03.780
WHEN SHE TURNED
INTO A WENDIGO...

28:03.880 --> 28:05.740
A WENDI-WHAT?

28:05.840 --> 28:06.900
UM, A WENDIGO.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.560
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
A WEREWOLF, ONLY MEANER.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.080
IS THIS THE SPELL
THAT YOU USED?

28:14.800 --> 28:17.140
UH-HUH.

28:17.240 --> 28:19.240
IS THERE SOME SORT
OF SPELL I COULD DO,

28:21.000 --> 28:22.500
YOU KNOW, IN ADVANCE,

28:22.600 --> 28:23.700
SO I COULD NOT BECOME
MAYBE A BANSHEE--

28:23.800 --> 28:25.980
WHAT WORD
DID YOU SUB DEMON WITH?

28:26.080 --> 28:28.080
DIRTBAG.

28:28.760 --> 28:30.760

28:42.760 --> 28:44.760
GUIDED SPIRITS,
HEAR OUR PLEA.

28:46.040 --> 28:49.000
ANNUL THIS MAGIC.
LET IT BE.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.200
PLEASE LET IT BE.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.980
OH.

29:01.080 --> 29:03.080
DO YOU THINK IT WORKED
A LITTLE TOO WELL?

29:05.000 --> 29:08.300

SHUT UP!

29:48.240 --> 29:51.420
DAMN IT.

29:51.520 --> 29:52.820
WHY ISN'T IT WORKING?

29:52.920 --> 29:53.940
BECAUSE PIPER ISN'T
A WITCH ANYMORE.

29:54.040 --> 29:55.900
CAN'T YOU
JUST SCRY FOR EVIL, THEN?

29:56.000 --> 29:57.940
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH EVIL

29:58.040 --> 30:00.040
IS RUNNING AROUND
SAN FRANCISCO?

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
DAMN IT, PIPER.

30:05.560 --> 30:07.560
COLE. THANK GOD.

30:08.960 --> 30:11.060
DON'T THANK HIM YET.

30:11.160 --> 30:12.900
YOU DIDN'T FIND HER?

30:13.000 --> 30:14.060
I DIDN'T GET
A CHANCE TO LOOK.

30:14.160 --> 30:15.900
EVERY TIME I USED
MY SENSING POWERS,

30:16.000 --> 30:17.580
A BOUNTY HUNTER
SENSED ME.

30:17.680 --> 30:18.580
I FOUGHT OFF 3 OF THEM.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.900
I'M SORRY.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.180
NO. THAT'S--THAT'S OK.

30:22.280 --> 30:23.820
I MEAN, SOMEHOW,
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OK.

30:23.920 --> 30:26.860
I DON'T HAVE
EVEN A LITTLE IDEA

GOING TO BE OK.

30:39.800 --> 30:41.420
DIDN'T YOU SAY
YOU FOUND ME

30:41.520 --> 30:42.420
BECAUSE PIPER
CAST A SPELL

30:42.520 --> 30:43.500
TO FIND
A LOST WITCH?

30:43.600 --> 30:46.080
YES, BUT I ALSO SAID THAT
PIPER'S NOT A WITCH ANYMORE.

30:46.560 --> 30:49.940
YES, BUT IF
I COULD SUBSTITUTE

30:50.040 --> 30:51.580
THE WORD "DIRTBAG"
FOR "DEMON,"

30:51.680 --> 30:53.900
WHY CAN'T
WE SUBSTITUTE

30:54.000 --> 30:54.900
THE WORD "SISTER"
FOR "WITCH"?

30:55.000 --> 30:55.900
WOULD THAT WORK?

30:56.000 --> 30:57.900
WELL, NO...

30:58.000 --> 30:59.780
NOT IF SHE'S ALREADY
LOOKING FOR A KILL.

30:59.880 --> 31:01.900
THE CALL WON'T BE
STRONG ENOUGH.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.260
WHY NOT?

31:03.360 --> 31:04.620
BECAUSE OF
THE PULL OF EVIL.

DON'T ASK.

31:10.360 --> 31:11.420

31:11.520 --> 31:13.520
I DON'T THINK SHE'LL
ANSWER THE CALL.

31:16.080 --> 31:19.600

ABOUT THIS?

I DID?

33:17.000 --> 33:18.140
IT'S A FEAR RESPONSE.

33:18.240 --> 33:19.300

HOW TO CONTROL IT,

IF WE HAVE TO

33:32.000 --> 33:33.620
JUST TO KEEP THE FURIES
DISTRACTED FROM COLE.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.360
OK, BUT WHAT I DON'T GET
IS HOW WE UN-DEMON PIPER
ONCE SHE GETS HERE.

33:35.440 --> 33:38.820
WELL, WE HAVE
TO CLOSE THE PORTAL
OF UNEXPRESSED FURY.

33:38.920 --> 33:42.100
UNEXPRESSED? I THINK
SHE'S BEEN RAGING FOR DAYS.

33:42.200 --> 33:44.660
THAT'S 'CAUSE
THERE'S SOMETHING
SHE'S NOT SAYING.

I DON'T KNOW...

33:48.000 --> 33:49.540
BUT I THINK
I HAVE AN IDEA.

33:49.640 --> 33:51.640
AAH!

33:52.000 --> 33:53.260
[GASPS]

33:53.360 --> 33:55.360
THEY'RE CLOSE.

33:56.760 --> 33:58.220
[WHIMPERING]

33:58.320 --> 34:00.260
PAIGE!

34:00.360 --> 34:02.360
I DID IT AGAIN.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.880
I'M SORRY.
I'M SO SORRY.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.060
PHOEBE!

34:18.159 --> 34:20.159
NICE DECOY, PIPER.
2 POINTS.

34:31.239 --> 34:34.500
COLE! COLE!

34:34.600 --> 34:37.920
LAMP!

34:39.960 --> 34:42.900
SORRY.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
REALLY SORRY.

34:54.199 --> 34:58.120
COLE IS NOT YOUR PROBLEM,
PIPER, AND YOU KNOW IT.

35:04.800 --> 35:08.000
BOOK!

35:09.000 --> 35:12.120
PLEASE LET THERE BE
SOMETHING IN HERE.

35:13.120 --> 35:15.120
COLE, DON'T!

35:16.440 --> 35:18.440
YOU THINK
I ABANDONED YOU.

35:19.280 --> 35:20.820
YOU THINK IT'S MY FAULT
THAT PRUE DIED.

35:20.920 --> 35:23.520
YOU BLAME ME.
YOU SHOULD JUST ADMIT IT.

35:26.400 --> 35:30.520
YOU DON'T WANT
TO KILL ME, PIPER.
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
IT'S NOT ABOUT ME.
IT'S NOT ABOUT
PHOEBE, IS IT?

35:34.880 --> 35:36.880
LEO!

35:40.680 --> 35:44.680
PHOEBE'S NOT THE SISTER
WHO ABANDONED YOU.
IT'S PRUE.

35:51.600 --> 35:54.900
WHERE'D HE TAKE THEM?

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
TO WHAT PIPER'S
REALLY ANGRY AT.

36:06.320 --> 36:10.120
TELL HER, PIPER.
IT'S ALL RIGHT
TO HATE HER.

36:14.000 --> 36:17.220
YOU SHOULD HATE HER.

36:17.320 --> 36:19.320
WHEN MY PARENTS DIED,
I HATED THEM FOR IT.

36:20.120 --> 36:23.180
I WAS ALONE,
AND I HATED THEM.

36:23.280 --> 36:25.840
IT IS OK TO HATE PRUE.

36:31.160 --> 36:34.460
HOW DARE YOU!

36:34.560 --> 36:36.900
HOW DARE YOU LEAVE ME!

36:37.000 --> 36:39.900
HOW COULD YOU GO
AND DIE

36:40.000 --> 36:41.900
AND LEAVE ME HERE
ALL ALONE?

36:42.000 --> 36:43.700
PLEASE COME BACK.

36:43.800 --> 36:46.460
I NEED YOU.

36:46.560 --> 36:48.260
PLEASE COME BACK.

36:48.360 --> 36:50.800
AAH!

36:58.000 --> 37:01.540
IT'S OK.
IT'S OK, HONEY.

37:01.640 --> 37:04.700
IT'S NOT OK.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.900
SHE RISKED HER LIFE
EVERY DAY,

37:07.000 --> 37:10.060
AND SHE NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

37:10.160 --> 37:12.060
TO ME AND PHOEBE
WHEN SHE WAS GONE.

37:12.160 --> 37:14.620
HOW COULD SHE THINK

37:14.720 --> 37:18.200
THAT I COULD LIVE
WITHOUT HER?

37:46.680 --> 37:49.900
DID YOU SLEEP?

37:50.000 --> 37:51.980
YEAH.

37:52.080 --> 37:54.080
ACTUALLY, BETTER THAN
I HAVE IN A WHILE.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.000
IT'S QUIET, ISN'T IT?

37:58.280 --> 37:59.580
EARLY AND LATE.

37:59.680 --> 38:02.000
IT'S JUST REALLY,
REALLY QUIET.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.440
PRUE WAS ALWAYS
THE FIRST ONE UP...

38:06.680 --> 38:08.940
AND THE LAST ONE DOWN.

38:09.040 --> 38:11.400
IT'S STRANGE,
THE THINGS THAT YOU MISS.

38:15.520 --> 38:18.460
SO...

38:18.560 --> 38:20.140
HOW SCARY WAS I?

38:20.240 --> 38:22.060
[LAUGHS]

38:22.160 --> 38:24.060
HECK,
I'VE SEEN WORSE.

38:24.160 --> 38:26.340
I'VE BEEN WORSE.

38:26.440 --> 38:27.580
BUT, UH...

38:27.680 --> 38:30.900
PAIGE...

38:31.000 --> 38:32.900
SHE COMPLETELY FREAKED.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.220
NO, UH,
SHE HANDLED IT...

38:34.320 --> 38:37.860
BETTER THAN MOST PEOPLE
WOULD, I THINK.

38:37.960 --> 38:41.100
SHE SAVED YOUR LIFE.

38:41.200 --> 38:43.200
SHE DEFINITELY
IS A HALLIWELL...

38:44.400 --> 38:46.900
LAST NAME OR NO.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
I KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN
THE MOST WELCOMING...

38:52.240 --> 38:55.460
I JUST...

38:55.560 --> 38:57.560
I MISS PRUE SO MUCH.

38:58.440 --> 39:01.260
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE
OPENING UP TO SOMEONE ELSE.

39:01.360 --> 39:03.980
WITH EVERYTHING THAT
HAPPENS IN OUR LIVES,

39:04.080 --> 39:06.560
LOVE JUST FEELS
LIKE AN INVITATION
FOR MORE PAIN.

39:14.880 --> 39:17.940
SO MAYBE, UM...

39:18.040 --> 39:20.400
MAYBE YOU DON'T
START WITH LOVE.

39:20.800 --> 39:23.000
MAYBE YOU JUST START
WITH "THANKS."

39:52.360 --> 39:55.700
MUFFINS. THANKS.

39:55.800 --> 39:58.080
BUSYWORK. I'M BEST
IN THE KITCHEN,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.080
PRUE WAS THE ONE
THAT LIKED TO AHH...
CHASE DEMONS.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.620
MAN, HE'S LIKE
A WHOLE NEW DONNIE.

40:09.720 --> 40:12.800
WHAT DID LEO SAY TO HIM?

40:16.600 --> 40:19.700
UM...

40:19.800 --> 40:21.580
I DON'T KNOW.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.680
HE'S A MIRACLE WORKER,
THAT HUSBAND OF MINE.

40:27.160 --> 40:30.640
SO...HOW ARE YOU?

40:31.200 --> 40:33.200
I'VE HAD, UH, BAD HOURS...

40:34.840 --> 40:37.920
AND HOURS THAT AREN'T
QUITE SO BAD.

40:39.360 --> 40:41.360
I GUESS YOU KNOW
HOW IT IS.

40:43.080 --> 40:45.160
YEAH.

40:46.280 --> 40:48.140
WHEN MY PARENTS DIED,

40:48.240 --> 40:50.240
THERE WERE SOME DAYS
I DIDN'T THINK I'D
SURVIVE THE SADNESS.

40:51.320 --> 40:53.360
IT'LL NEVER BE OK THAT
SHE'S GONE, PIPER...

40:55.080 --> 40:58.800
BUT I PROMISE
IT WILL GET BETTER.

41:01.160 --> 41:05.000
YOU KNOW, LEO COULD
FIX THAT FOR YOU.

41:05.840 --> 41:07.840
IT'S MY FIRST WAR WOUND.

41:09.160 --> 41:10.500
I'M THINK I'LL WEAR IT
WITH PRIDE.

41:10.600 --> 41:11.900
UNFORTUNATELY,
IN THIS FAMILY,

41:12.000 --> 41:14.620
IT WILL NOT BE THE LAST.

41:14.720 --> 41:16.900
WELL, EVERY FAMILY HAS
ITS PROS AND ITS CONS.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.900
A COUPLE
OF DEMON BATTLES

41:20.000 --> 41:21.820
IN EXCHANGE FOR
THE POWER TO CLEAR UP
MY FRIEND'S SKIN?

41:21.920 --> 41:24.580
I'D SAY IT'S WORTH IT.

41:24.680 --> 41:26.680
THE POWER TO WHAT?

41:28.320 --> 41:31.740
HE'S CUTE, ISN'T HE?

41:31.840 --> 41:33.660
WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE
SEEN HIM YESTERDAY.

41:33.760 --> 41:35.760
OK, YOU SAVED MY LIFE,

41:37.040 --> 41:39.900
SO I GUESS WE'RE EVEN ON
THE BOOK OF SHADOWS SWIPE.

41:40.000 --> 41:43.860
BUT, PAIGE, THERE ARE RULES
TO BEING A WITCH--

41:43.960 --> 41:46.500
RULES THAT YOU WILL
HAVE TO LEARN AND FOLLOW.

41:46.600 --> 41:50.100
WELL, NOT
TO BE DIFFICULT, BUT...

41:50.200 --> 41:53.060
YOU'RE MARRIED
TO OUR WHITELIGHTER,

41:53.160 --> 41:55.660
AND PHOEBE'S SHACKING UP
WITH A DEMON...

41:55.760 --> 41:58.900
SO, ON BALANCE,

41:59.000 --> 42:00.540
MAYBE MY FRIEND
COULD STAY CUTE?

42:00.640 --> 42:02.640
OK.

42:03.280 --> 42:05.280
MY, MY, MY...

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
THAT PILE LOOKS
ABOUT THE SAME SIZE

42:09.000 --> 42:10.620
AS IT DID ABOUT
AN HOUR AGO.

42:10.720 --> 42:11.900
OH, THAT WAS MY FAULT.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.740
I DISTRACTED HER
WITH MUFFINS.

42:13.840 --> 42:15.840
AND YOU ARE?

42:18.320 --> 42:21.760
I'M HER SISTER.
