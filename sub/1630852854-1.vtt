01:09.270 --> 01:14.530
There is a land far up north where the vikings ancestors reside.

02:59.160 --> 03:01.520
Everybody ready.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.280
Camera!

03:06.320 --> 03:08.540
Action!

06:34.220 --> 06:36.300
Cut

06:36.340 --> 06:41.280
Boys, this sounds really good.

06:42.360 --> 06:48.260
Absolutely. We need PR. Newspapers, TV.

06:48.300 --> 06:53.220
Social media, Wimp, Spotify. Stuff like that.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.220
I mean it. Really good.

06:56.260 --> 07:00.340
I'm sure the record will sell really well.

07:01.300 --> 07:05.220
You're pretty good at playing guitar.

07:05.460 --> 07:07.040
Thanks.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.960
You know many chords.

07:08.960 --> 07:12.460
Let's do another take.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.060
We'll do one more.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.160
Do that. Practice.

07:19.140 --> 07:21.340
Fucking good.

09:06.060 --> 09:12.060
Thor and his men makes plans for the future. Evil comes disquised as good intentions.

09:12.060 --> 09:14.540
This is gonna be so cool.

09:15.080 --> 09:19.200
This is working really fucking well, Jorn.

09:19.240 --> 09:22.200
What a moviemaker.

09:22.240 --> 09:27.380
I really want to make a real movie.

09:27.420 --> 09:31.220
A viking movie based on The Saga of the Ere-Dwellers.

09:31.260 --> 09:33.280
I want you in it.

09:33.280 --> 09:35.340
We're not actors.

09:35.380 --> 09:36.960
We'll take care of that.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.460
I'm in.

09:38.500 --> 09:42.120
Think about all the chicks we'll get.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.160
Chicks and cash.

09:44.200 --> 09:48.260
Chicks. And a little cash, after a while.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.400
Steinar, chicks.

10:01.400 --> 10:05.060
Boys! You have to come with me!

10:05.100 --> 10:07.120
The church is burning!

10:07.160 --> 10:10.120
It's burning like hell!

10:11.180 --> 10:13.220
Did you hear me?

10:13.260 --> 10:15.480
It's on TV, look!

10:16.380 --> 10:17.420
Oh fuck.

10:17.420 --> 10:21.280
We can do a band photo here.

10:21.320 --> 10:24.220
The band logo up here.

10:24.260 --> 10:30.260
And then sparks will fly out of the cover. We're gonna rake in cash.

10:30.300 --> 10:32.380
Boys, come on! Time is running out!

10:32.420 --> 10:37.260
We're not gonna shoot in front of the church, do you hear me?

10:37.300 --> 10:39.060
It smells like cash.

10:39.060 --> 10:40.360
Forget it.

10:40.360 --> 10:45.480
This is the road to success. This is real metal, to my understanding.

10:45.520 --> 10:50.260
You can't say no.This is my thing.

10:50.460 --> 10:55.260
Trym, you have to leave. We're working.

10:55.300 --> 11:00.200
We have to make the video.We can't do a photo shoot now.

11:00.240 --> 11:03.280
Hey, we spoke about this.

11:04.180 --> 11:06.300
No, we haven't.

11:07.160 --> 11:09.200
Not about this.

11:09.240 --> 11:14.060
We'll do it some other time.We have to keep working.

11:21.140 --> 11:23.520
Come on...

11:24.360 --> 11:26.380
Fuck.

11:30.140 --> 11:37.540
Live: Church fire tonight

11:38.080 --> 11:43.140
Fair maidens look as the house of faith goes up in flames.

11:43.140 --> 11:46.460
Vengeance will ignite the spark of evil.

11:46.520 --> 11:49.380
Oh no!

11:50.540 --> 11:53.040
Didn't you get married there?

11:53.040 --> 11:54.180
Yeah.

11:54.180 --> 11:56.320
Oh no...

11:57.160 --> 12:00.040
The whole neighborhood will go.

12:00.040 --> 12:02.000
The wood is so dry.

12:29.220 --> 12:30.440
Hey.

12:30.440 --> 12:33.160
Miriam! Come here!

12:33.200 --> 12:36.380
Look! The church is burning. Quick!

12:36.420 --> 12:38.300
Our church.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.300
It's live.

12:41.420 --> 12:44.200
Damn...

12:44.240 --> 12:46.440
It's our church!

12:50.200 --> 12:53.160
It's a tragedy.

12:53.160 --> 12:55.060
Jesus.

12:57.400 --> 13:00.420
It's arson!

13:00.460 --> 13:02.260
You can't know that.

13:02.260 --> 13:04.260
It's arson, I'm telling you.

13:04.300 --> 13:08.440
I drove past and it was there,and now it's up in flames.

13:08.480 --> 13:11.220
Do you think it would just burn like that?

13:11.260 --> 13:14.200
-What did you see? -There were three bikes.

13:14.240 --> 13:19.520
-What kind of bikes were they? -Does that even matter?

13:20.060 --> 13:22.540
-You're in the way. -So get up!

13:23.080 --> 13:27.260
-Find a solution instead. -Can you please calm down?

13:27.300 --> 13:31.120
It's our duty to do something about that.

13:33.540 --> 13:37.540
-We have to avenge that church. -Yes!

13:38.080 --> 13:42.120
We have to avenge it and get those who did this-

13:42.160 --> 13:45.460
-and tear their members off.

13:45.500 --> 13:50.140
Are we gonna sit here and argue, or are we gonna go there?

13:50.180 --> 13:54.180
-Is anyone gonna join me? -Yes!

13:56.120 --> 13:58.320
Idiots.

13:59.100 --> 14:01.100
Wait, Miriam!

14:01.140 --> 14:05.240
Live: Church fire tonight

14:11.400 --> 14:15.160
Thor, we need to talk.

14:16.100 --> 14:20.100
-It's about the church fire. -Yeah.

14:20.340 --> 14:24.180
I lost a lot of money on that.

14:25.200 --> 14:30.520
Us businessmen, we have to take the opportunity when it arises.

14:31.060 --> 14:36.100
We have to do PR all day, all the time, 24/7.

14:36.140 --> 14:39.500
You know what people want.True Norwegian Black Metal.

14:39.540 --> 14:43.080
We don't do that anymore, Trym.

14:43.120 --> 14:48.180
We're doing more important stuff. You haven't heard it yet,-

14:48.220 --> 14:51.200
-but Sarke wants to make a movie with me.

14:53.140 --> 14:55.420
What kind of movie?

14:55.460 --> 14:59.120
A viking movie based on old sagas.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.400
Cool! A viking film?

15:02.100 --> 15:06.260
I've worked in the viking business before.

15:06.300 --> 15:08.520
I was in a theatre play.

15:09.060 --> 15:11.540
I had my own sword. It was a historical thing.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.460
I'm totally in.

15:14.500 --> 15:18.460
-The band is in. -Very good.

15:18.500 --> 15:23.480
You probably need a chieftain. I want that part.

15:23.520 --> 15:29.260
I'm kind of a chieftain in real life too, you know.

15:29.300 --> 15:33.280
It's too early to deal out parts. We'll talk about it later.

15:33.320 --> 15:38.420
That part is mine. I can feel it. It's gonna be awesome.

15:39.380 --> 15:42.340
I don't have time for this, Trym.

15:42.380 --> 15:46.180
No, it's fine.

15:46.220 --> 15:49.280
I'm busy too. Bye!

15:54.360 --> 16:01.160
The Saga begins to write itself. Of injustice and vengeance blood ties are created.

16:53.340 --> 16:56.160
Thanks. Great.

17:03.480 --> 17:07.320
-It's fun on the road. -Sorry?

17:08.140 --> 17:11.320
I'm getting a call. It's Thor.

17:12.460 --> 17:14.520
Hello?

17:15.060 --> 17:17.200
It's Thor.

17:17.240 --> 17:23.060
You know the movie we talked about?

17:24.260 --> 17:30.480
I'd like to go and check out locations today.

17:30.520 --> 17:34.080
Pretty soon, if you have time.

17:34.380 --> 17:38.060
Yeah, sure.I'm out driving with Eivind.

17:38.500 --> 17:42.160
Meet me at Black Lake in half an hour.

17:46.180 --> 17:49.360
Great. Bye.

21:18.180 --> 21:22.260
Maria, you have to hear the end.

21:23.420 --> 21:27.200
It's a small chapter on the Antichrist.

21:36.260 --> 21:39.140
"For the many Antichrists"

21:39.540 --> 21:42.300
I'm just gonna read.

21:43.300 --> 21:47.220
"Dear children, this is the last hour."

21:47.260 --> 21:50.500
"And as you have heard that the antichrist is coming,-"

21:50.540 --> 21:55.240
"-even now many antichrists have come." That, we know.

22:58.160 --> 23:00.540
"This is how we know it's the last hour."

23:01.080 --> 23:04.420
"They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us."

23:04.460 --> 23:09.420
"For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us."

23:10.220 --> 23:14.260
"But their going showed that none of them belonged to us."

23:15.520 --> 23:18.280
Let us say Amen.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.440
Amen.

23:20.480 --> 23:25.260
-Shall we go and eat? -Yeah.

23:25.300 --> 23:28.440
You should have been a priest,Miriam.

23:35.200 --> 23:41.340
What a special place. Did they do rituals here? Is it a burial site?

23:41.380 --> 23:44.480
-It's a burial site. -Right.

23:46.180 --> 23:52.440
The water was probably closer then.

24:00.360 --> 24:12.340
But when they built it, were there structures around here you think?

24:13.120 --> 24:17.520
I don't know.This is from 400 A.D.

24:18.060 --> 24:24.260
If it's a heritage site, we can't use it in the movie.

24:43.460 --> 24:46.380
Just drive. We'll follow you.

25:05.960 --> 25:09.960
I have to leave for an other job. Bye.

25:56.120 --> 26:00.100
Hey! That's one of the bikes from the cemetery!

27:40.240 --> 27:42.400
Come on!

27:44.120 --> 27:48.300
You can't burn down the house of God and not get punished!

27:48.340 --> 27:52.360
Miriam saw your bike the night it was burning.

28:05.220 --> 28:08.300
Take it easy.

28:11.300 --> 28:14.180
Kick him. There you go!

29:25.060 --> 29:28.340
Miriam, "thou shalt not kill".

29:28.520 --> 29:33.320
-Do not use the Bible against me! -Can you calm down?

29:33.360 --> 29:37.220
You can go to hell.

29:37.260 --> 29:41.500
Hey, take a look at this! 710.

29:41.540 --> 29:45.300
It's a sign.The Pentateuch.

29:45.340 --> 29:48.220
"God will smite those who hate him."

29:48.260 --> 29:52.160
-We will help God kill. -What?

29:52.200 --> 29:56.440
It says "oil".That's not a sign of killing.

29:56.480 --> 30:00.480
Haven't you read the Bible? Haven't you heard of the burning bush?

30:00.520 --> 30:03.480
Yes, Miriam.

30:29.060 --> 30:34.060
The first battle has past, and Thor nearly lost a man.

30:34.260 --> 30:38.260
The proud steed brings his men to the play.

30:38.260 --> 30:42.060
The saga will be made eternal with lights and shadows.

30:42.060 --> 30:47.060
But noe one knows that misdeeds soon will follow misdeeds.

31:44.180 --> 31:47.240
We can pray, Miriam.

31:48.320 --> 31:51.100
Fine, I'll pray.

31:51.140 --> 31:56.400
Dear Lord, I know I have sinned.

31:58.260 --> 32:02.420
Jesus Christ took the punishment that I deserved.

32:02.460 --> 32:07.480
I believe in him. I pray for your forgiveness.

32:07.520 --> 32:11.260
I pray for your forgiveness.

32:11.300 --> 32:15.220
-Halleluja. -Amen.

32:18.280 --> 32:20.380
I'm sorry.

32:37.060 --> 32:40.060
Heavy work waitsThor.

32:40.060 --> 32:45.060
Friends help, and sacrifice will compel the effort of good powers.

33:23.460 --> 33:26.480
To Frigg and Siv.

33:30.160 --> 33:34.380
Even though it is summer,we will drink to the power-

33:34.420 --> 33:39.400
-that creates the individuality and symmetry of snowflakes.

33:49.340 --> 33:52.220
Let's drink to Brage.

33:53.200 --> 33:57.380
Give me inspiration to make my movie.

34:06.480 --> 34:10.420
Hail Eir, hail those who heal.

34:21.160 --> 34:24.220
Hail Regin, hail Allfather.

34:39.400 --> 34:41.420
Did you find the story?

34:41.460 --> 34:45.460
It's really an old zombie story.

34:46.460 --> 34:49.540
A viking zombie story?

34:50.080 --> 34:56.060
Torolv Bogefot was a chieftain who died on his seat-

34:56.100 --> 35:00.100
-one night.

35:00.140 --> 35:04.060
He was still sitting there when everyone else woke up.

35:04.100 --> 35:07.320
They found him dead and buried him.

35:07.360 --> 35:12.360
He broke out of his grave and terrorized his village.

35:12.400 --> 35:16.460
-It's quite a classic zombie story. -Exactly.

35:16.500 --> 35:22.060
There's a lot we can play around with.

35:22.100 --> 35:27.520
I was thinking the chieftains' houses should be up here.

35:28.060 --> 35:30.160
Maybe some animals.

35:30.200 --> 35:34.100
We have to build sets.

36:43.540 --> 36:46.540
Do you wanna see something cool?

36:52.180 --> 36:54.320
Yes!

36:54.360 --> 36:57.180
Now!

39:38.160 --> 39:40.360
Yes.

39:41.200 --> 39:44.080
OK.Talk to you later.

40:05.380 --> 40:07.500
A little lower.

40:16.180 --> 40:20.060
You idiots. I don't want this on me.

40:28.540 --> 40:33.960
Kenneth, work on the sword fighting scenes with the boys until you're happy with it.

40:33.960 --> 40:35.360
Hello, ladies.

40:35.360 --> 40:38.480
We have to do that.Take your time.

40:38.520 --> 40:41.140
OK? Yeah.

40:41.180 --> 40:46.360
Thomas, take some of the wood with you. It doesn't fit the picture.

40:52.260 --> 40:54.420
You guys look very good.

40:54.460 --> 40:59.220
I'm a weaponry specialist. I've starred in several viking plays.

41:00.120 --> 41:03.220
I see that you're playing a thrall.

41:03.260 --> 41:05.420
An important job.

41:05.460 --> 41:08.360
I'm good with weapons.

41:09.520 --> 41:12.520
Boys!If it isn't the whole band.

41:13.380 --> 41:18.060
What a band. Hey, Thor. I'm ready.

41:18.100 --> 41:21.440
I'm busy. We'll talk later.

41:21.480 --> 41:26.200
-What? -Take some of the wood with you.

41:26.240 --> 41:31.520
I'm playing the chieftain Torolv.

41:32.440 --> 41:38.120
-I'm playing his wife.-Torolv, get ready for scene 7.

41:38.160 --> 41:41.220
This horse is like an old Volkswagen.

41:41.260 --> 41:45.460
-Give me something more powerful.-We'll take care of it.

41:45.500 --> 41:48.360
What's this bullshit? Torolv?

41:48.400 --> 41:53.540
It's my part! I'm playing the chieftain. We talked about this.

41:54.320 --> 41:59.160
-That was my part.-It was never yours.

42:02.320 --> 42:05.480
You promised me that part.

42:05.520 --> 42:11.320
I was born to be a viking chieftain and to plunder and rape.

42:13.500 --> 42:16.340
Fucking hell!

42:25.140 --> 42:29.080
Is everyone ready? Let's do this.

42:29.460 --> 42:32.120
We're rolling.

42:32.160 --> 42:34.360
OK.

42:39.360 --> 42:41.240
A bit boring colourgrading.

42:41.240 --> 42:43.340
What about this?

42:43.340 --> 42:44.980
Too much blue.

42:44.980 --> 42:46.380
Thats fine.

42:47.360 --> 42:48.980
Let's use this.

42:51.060 --> 42:56.060
The saga tells that Snorre had put good people to work in the woods of Kraakenes.

42:56.060 --> 42:59.060
Torolv Baegefod felt that too many trees were felled.

42:59.060 --> 43:06.060
He rode to Snorre and asked him to give him back the forest.

43:14.520 --> 43:19.520
Give me the axe.You have to chop right into the twig.

43:32.320 --> 43:34.400
Snorre.

43:35.140 --> 43:37.280
Huh?

43:37.320 --> 43:41.340
You're only borrowing these woods. I never gave it to you.

43:41.380 --> 43:47.060
You gave me these woods yourself, Torolv.

43:47.100 --> 43:50.280
We even had witnesses.

43:50.320 --> 43:54.320
You will never get it back.

43:56.240 --> 44:01.160
Unless we meet in the moot and you emerge victorious.

44:12.060 --> 44:16.160
Torolv rode in anger to Arnkjel, his son.

44:16.160 --> 44:19.060
He does not want there to be a strife between them.

44:19.060 --> 44:23.440
Between father and son, old strifes shall be buried and they shall be friends.

44:23.440 --> 44:27.240
But old misdeeds are not healed with empty words.

44:35.240 --> 44:39.420
I'm here, Arnkjell, because I do not want there to be a feud between us.

44:39.460 --> 44:43.220
We should let go of the feud and be kinsmen.

44:43.260 --> 44:46.540
Snorre will not return the forest to us.

44:47.300 --> 44:50.200
He says that I gave it to him.

44:50.240 --> 44:52.280
It is a lie.

44:52.440 --> 44:58.060
You cannot rejoice over our feud out of spite.

44:58.100 --> 45:04.480
Think what you will, but I don't want to fight over the woods with Snorre.

45:13.060 --> 45:20.060
The saga tells that Torolv did not like the way it went, he felt that he never got what he wanted.

45:20.060 --> 45:23.060
He did not speak to anyone.

45:23.060 --> 45:28.060
He did not eat anything that night, and stayed up when the men went to bed.

46:48.440 --> 46:51.100
Torolv?

46:51.140 --> 46:53.380
Father?

46:55.380 --> 47:00.360
In the morning. Torolv was still sitting there, and he was dead.

47:00.360 --> 47:05.060
People were frightened, for it was an ugly death.

47:05.500 --> 47:11.080
Before his eyes and nose are closed, do not approach him from the front.

47:30.360 --> 47:36.080
Do not carry him out of the door. This way, he won't find his way back.

48:11.340 --> 48:16.260
Torolv was groomed and lain in a stone grave.

50:37.060 --> 50:39.060
After Torolv Baegefods death,

50:39.060 --> 50:44.260
many felt that it had become more dangerous to be out after sundown,

50:44.260 --> 50:50.060
eventually people were worried that Torolv was not lying still.

53:49.360 --> 53:54.260
Torolv often showed himself at his farm. He was horrible towards his housewife.

53:54.260 --> 53:59.020
She almost lost her mind, finally she died.

54:34.340 --> 54:36.400
OK.

54:56.060 --> 55:00.060
She was carried to the dolmen and laid by Torolvs side,

55:00.060 --> 55:04.060
and after this, people moved away from the farm.

57:03.060 --> 57:07.060
After the winter came a beautiful spring.

57:07.060 --> 57:12.060
When the frost melted away, Arnkjel sent men to Torolvs grave to break it up.

57:12.060 --> 57:15.060
People complained about the unrest of the dead,

57:15.060 --> 57:18.060
and they felt that Arnkjel owed them to make amends.

57:18.060 --> 57:23.960
Therefore, Arnkjel sent men there to carry Torolv away and bury him in a different place.

58:43.360 --> 58:50.060
In the dolmen, they found Torolv healthy, yet horrendous to look at.

58:50.060 --> 58:54.060
He was black as Hel and large as a cattle.

58:54.060 --> 58:59.060
They got him out of the dolmen and made a large bonfire by the shore.

58:59.060 --> 59:04.260
They laid Torolv on it. Then , they burned it down to ashes.

1:02:32.060 --> 1:02:35.060
Hard work and toil shall always be rewarded.

1:02:35.060 --> 1:02:39.060
At the gathering, evil minds will meet their equals.

1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:42.400
Hi.

1:04:08.220 --> 1:04:10.360
We're ready.

1:04:12.200 --> 1:04:15.200
Let's do this.

1:08:02.320 --> 1:08:08.240
Thank you so much. It was a pleasure to play for you in Porsgrunn.

1:08:18.060 --> 1:08:21.200
Now, we'll drink more beer.

1:08:25.240 --> 1:08:29.320
More! More! More!

1:08:29.360 --> 1:08:34.460
More! More! More!

1:09:01.060 --> 1:09:07.060
Many know, and many will know, that the biggest vice of evil is boasting and pride.

1:09:09.120 --> 1:09:11.460
Is this seat free?

1:09:13.460 --> 1:09:18.160
Very cool outfit. Do you drive a big bike?

1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:20.500
Is it your Vespa out there?

1:09:20.540 --> 1:09:23.320
I'm just kidding.

1:09:23.360 --> 1:09:30.200
I scanned the premises,and there are a lot of overripe fruit,-

1:09:30.240 --> 1:09:32.960
- but then I saw your hair.

1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:36.200
Quit it! You viking asshole.

1:09:36.240 --> 1:09:41.420
I'm in a viking film that they're filming here in Oklungen.

1:09:41.460 --> 1:09:45.160
I'm also the band's manager.

1:09:46.220 --> 1:09:49.540
-Yeah, right.-It's true.

1:09:50.260 --> 1:09:55.460
Their music kicks ass, but they suck at PR.

1:09:55.500 --> 1:09:59.480
That's my job. I'm a businessman.

1:09:59.520 --> 1:10:04.060
I know money and creative solutions.

1:10:04.100 --> 1:10:06.340
This is for you, baby.

1:10:07.260 --> 1:10:13.520
I thought they should have used the church fire to their advantage.

1:10:14.060 --> 1:10:18.180
They could have earned big money on that.

1:10:18.420 --> 1:10:22.160
Did they do that? Answer me!

1:10:22.200 --> 1:10:25.220
Are you interested, all of a sudden?

1:10:25.260 --> 1:10:30.220
No, they don't have the balls for that.

1:10:30.260 --> 1:10:34.300
But I did them a huge favor-

1:10:34.340 --> 1:10:39.160
-by setting a little fire to that church.

1:10:39.200 --> 1:10:45.480
But they didn't even want to take a band picture in front of the flames.

1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:51.420
Cause that was "so 90s". What's that about?

1:10:51.460 --> 1:10:55.220
Those boys aren't very metal.

1:10:55.260 --> 1:11:01.400
Listen, it's almost unethical not to grab that chance.

1:11:05.180 --> 1:11:08.320
Wait here for a moment.

1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:22.320
Hello? Time is up.

1:11:23.520 --> 1:11:26.220
Hey.

1:11:26.260 --> 1:11:30.220
-Do I have a point, or what? -You do.

1:11:30.260 --> 1:11:35.360
-I knew it. -Yes, but I have an idea.

1:11:38.520 --> 1:11:41.520
Why not?

1:11:42.060 --> 1:11:44.320
I'm in!

1:13:51.960 --> 1:13:53.960
Come on.

1:14:01.160 --> 1:14:03.320
Are you awake?

1:14:46.080 --> 1:14:49.260
Fireman Sam is awake.

1:14:49.300 --> 1:14:51.360
Everything cool?

1:14:54.340 --> 1:14:57.380
I said, everything cool?

1:15:16.480 --> 1:15:19.320
Maria, give me the can.

1:15:36.400 --> 1:15:39.240
Let's go.

1:16:29.520 --> 1:16:32.120
Thor!

1:16:57.340 --> 1:17:00.520
Jorn. Jorn!

1:17:33.160 --> 1:17:36.060
Morning.

1:18:14.240 --> 1:18:17.380
Last day of shooting.

1:18:19.060 --> 1:18:23.500
We have to mobilise the troops and go to Oklungen.

1:18:23.540 --> 1:18:26.540
-Are you ready? -Soon.

1:18:28.340 --> 1:18:31.100
I don't feel ready.

1:18:32.240 --> 1:18:34.440
But...

1:18:34.480 --> 1:18:39.460
The last day has to be celebrated.

1:18:39.500 --> 1:18:43.420
Even more and even harder.

1:19:55.200 --> 1:19:57.220
Hello?

1:21:28.380 --> 1:21:32.460
Evil has met evil in a bitter battle, and ended itself.

1:21:32.500 --> 1:21:37.220
Thor and his men stood proudly against it.

1:21:37.260 --> 1:21:40.360
Thus ends this saga.

1:21:48.060 --> 1:21:51.060
-Trym! - Fuck!

1:21:51.380 --> 1:21:54.380
What happened?

1:21:55.160 --> 1:21:57.360
I'm calling the cops.

1:22:01.480 --> 1:22:04.080
Hello, is this the police?

1:22:07.080 --> 1:22:11.500


1:22:42.320 --> 1:22:47.080
You should step aside.This is now a crime scene.

1:22:47.120 --> 1:22:50.380
Step aside.I will question you later.

1:23:11.200 --> 1:23:13.460
You can't film here!

1:23:13.500 --> 1:23:15.520
For fuck's sake!

1:23:16.260 --> 1:23:19.260
Thor, what are we gonna do?

1:23:19.260 --> 1:23:21.340
I don't know...

1:23:21.340 --> 1:23:24.340
Chill, we'll fix it in editing.
