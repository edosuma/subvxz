36:25.616 --> 36:28.953

36:34.792 --> 36:36.561

it's important for Bentley.

What's going on?
How long is she--

37:29.947 --> 37:32.850
{\an3}- I think 30 days, and then if
she--if the psychiatrist

37:32.917 --> 37:35.353

"You should probably

- Yeah.

{\an3}"I don't want to feel
like this anymore."

37:43.661 --> 37:45.663
{\an3}She's still having a hard time,
because I told her--I said,

37:45.730 --> 37:46.731
{\an3}"I'm gonna be honest
with you, honey."

37:46.797 --> 37:48.966
I said, "I can't do this
for the rest of my life.

37:49.033 --> 37:50.568
{\an3}That's all
I'm telling you right now."

37:50.635 --> 37:51.902
- Well, sure.
- And she told me.

37:51.969 --> 37:53.004
{\an3}She was like,
"No. I don't either."

37:53.070 --> 37:54.839
{\an3}I said, "Because this whole
first year of marriage

around three months old.

38:04.915 --> 38:07.518

you know, just--

- But I didn't know.

38:09.687 --> 38:11.622
{\an3}You're a new mom--
I don't know what you're doing.

38:11.689 --> 38:14.925
I eventually go and take Nova
with me to wake her up by noon.

38:14.992 --> 38:16.727
I'm like, "Okay.
You know what, dude?

38:16.794 --> 38:18.362

- Noon, really?

38:18.429 --> 38:19.897
It's going on for that--okay.
- Noon.

I felt so bad for her.

"Why am I so [bleep] up,"
