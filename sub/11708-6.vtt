{\an8}- UH, I NEED TO GET HANGERS.

17:31.425 --> 17:32.760
{\an8}YOU HAVE TO DISCUSS

17:32.843 --> 17:34.303
{\an8}- I NEED HANGERS, DUDE.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.262
{\an8}- IS THAT OKAY?

{\an8}- YEAH, WE GOTTA
GET A DEAL, THOUGH,

17:36.889 --> 17:37.973

{\an8}- IT WORKS BETTER ON THE FLOOR
WHEN YOU'RE MAKING A SALE.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.319

{\an8}- LET'S GET ON THE FLOOR.
LET'S MAKE SOME SALES!

17:52.404 --> 17:54.156
{\an8}- WHO'S NEXT?

17:54.239 --> 17:55.866
{\an8}- CAN WE DO SOMETHING STUPID

17:55.949 --> 17:58.160
{\an8}- WHAT DO WE DO,

17:58.243 --> 17:59.787
{\an8}- LET'S DO THE FOLLOW GAME.

I KNOW IT'S TROUBLE.

18:17.679 --> 18:19.890
{\an8}- NO, WAIT.
DON'T RUN, I'M GONNA THROW UP.

18:21.141 --> 18:23.852
{\an8}- TRUST ME, FOLLOW ME OUT.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.562
{\an8}JUST PLAY SHADOW.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.192

GET REAL.

18:31.860 --> 18:33.862
{\an8}I'M OVER YOU TODAY.
I'M GOING TO HAVE SOME FUN."

18:33.946 --> 18:37.658
{\an8}- [giggling]

18:48.377 --> 18:49.837
{\an8}- I'M SCARED.

18:49.920 --> 18:52.339
{\an8}- WHAT'S UP WITH MY BROTHER?
YOU KNOW, DEENA'S SISTER.

18:52.422 --> 18:53.590
{\an8}YOU'RE TELLING ME IT WAS
A SMASH AND DASH PRETTY MUCH.

18:53.674 --> 18:56.718
{\an8}- [laughing]

19:03.475 --> 19:04.434
{\an8}- [giggling]

19:04.518 --> 19:07.563
{\an8}- I DON'T REALLY CARE.
[Snooki burps]

19:07.646 --> 19:10.274

19:16.321 --> 19:18.115
{\an8}- DANNY'S PISSED.

19:18.198 --> 19:19.825
{\an8}- HOW THE HELL
CAN THE MEATBALLS DO THIS?

19:19.908 --> 19:21.910
{\an8}YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE WORK
WITHOUT TELLING ANYBODY.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.245
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, PAULY,
I'M GONNA GO LOOK

19:23.328 --> 19:24.163

{\an8}- OKAY.

19:26.164 --> 19:26.748
{\an8}ALL RIGHT.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.084
{\an8}- I APPRECIATE IT.

19:29.167 --> 19:30.836
{\an8}- I'LL RUN THE WHOLE STORE
WHILE YOU'RE GONE.

19:30.919 --> 19:32.379
{\an8}PUT THE MUSIC ON!
THE BOSS IS GONE!

19:32.462 --> 19:35.299
{\an8}PUT THE MUSIC ON!

19:38.343 --> 19:39.761
{\an8}- OH, HOLD UP.
THERE SHE IS.

{\an8}- YEAH, CRAZY, THOUGH.

19:41.179 --> 19:43.265
{\an8}LIKE, THE WORST I'VE EVER SEEN
IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE.

19:43.348 --> 19:44.516
{\an8}LIKE THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.809
{\an8}SO THERE'S THIS GIRL.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.644
{\an8}SHE BOUGHT SOMETHING
AT THE STORE THE OTHER DAY.

19:47.728 --> 19:48.770
{\an8}BUT NOW I HAVE NOT STOPPED
SEEING THIS GIRL.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.355
{\an8}EVERY TIME I TURN MY HEAD,
SHE'S THERE.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.732
{\an8}THAT'S IT.
I NEVER SPOKE TO HER.

19:51.815 --> 19:53.150
{\an8}I CAN'T EVEN LOOK
OUTSIDE THE T-SHIRT SHOP,

19:53.233 --> 19:55.235
{\an8}'CAUSE I KEEP LOOKING AT HER,
AND SHE LOOKS AT ME IN THE EYE.

19:55.319 --> 19:56.320
{\an8}AND IT'S SCARY.

19:56.403 --> 19:57.446
{\an8}I WANNA SEE WHAT HER ROOM
LOOKS LIKE.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.282
{\an8}BUT NOT WITH HER IN IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

20:03.702 --> 20:04.286
{\an8}- CHEERS.

20:10.250 --> 20:12.461
{\an8}- OH, GOD.

20:12.544 --> 20:15.714
{\an8}- NO, JUST RUN.

{\an8}TRYING TO GET US
BACK TO WORK.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.608
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE WE'RE
ABOVE THE LAW.

20:34.691 --> 20:37.069
{\an8}YOU'RE NOT MY FRIEND

20:52.125 --> 20:56.505
{\an8}MAKE SOME SALES PLEASE.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.090
{\an8}- I'LL HELP YOU.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.899
{\an8}- OH, I FEEL BAD.

21:17.693 --> 21:21.029
{\an8}- WHERE ARE THE MEATBALLS?

21:21.113 --> 21:22.364
{\an8}- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

21:22.447 --> 21:24.908
{\an8}- DANNY HAS NO CONTROL OVER
THESE MEATBALLS WHATSOEVER.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.201
{\an8}- HOW DO THEY DO THIS?

21:26.284 --> 21:28.662

{\an8}- YES, THAT'S
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

22:04.364 --> 22:05.949
{\an8}- SHE'S GONNA SMASH
YOUR KNEECAPS.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.284
{\an8}- I HOPE SHE FEEDS ME.

22:07.367 --> 22:10.912

22:10.996 --> 22:14.875
{\an8}SCARY.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.920
{\an8}- ARE YOU GUYS WAITING
FOR THE MEATBALLS THEN, OR--

22:19.004 --> 22:20.630
{\an8}- I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THE PLAN IS.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.174
{\an8}- CAN I GO WITH YOU
TO FIND THEM?

22:22.257 --> 22:25.343
{\an8}I AM NOT SURPRISED THAT THE
MEATBALLS DID THE DIP AT WORK.

22:25.427 --> 22:27.095
{\an8}THE ONLY THING
I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS,

22:27.179 --> 22:28.013
{\an8}I'M NOT GETTING STUCK
WITH MIKE.

22:28.096 --> 22:30.182
{\an8}I WILL FIND THE MEATBALLS.

22:30.265 --> 22:31.850
{\an8}- LET'S ROLL OUT.

22:36.730 --> 22:38.815
{\an8}- PLAY POOL SOMEWHERE
OR SOMETHING.

22:38.899 --> 22:39.399
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.

22:42.569 --> 22:45.280
{\an8}- OH, WAIT.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.870
{\an8}- WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

22:51.953 --> 22:53.580
{\an8}- THEY'RE GONNA GET WASTED

22:53.663 --> 22:57.709
{\an8}OR THEY'RE GETTING WASTED.

{\an8}AND SHE JUST WANTS

23:12.474 --> 23:14.976
{\an8}AND SO IT'S LIKE,
"MISSED YOU!"

23:15.060 --> 23:16.394
{\an8}- I WASN'T GETTING STUCK
WITH MIKE.

23:22.400 --> 23:26.029
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.
WHERE DID SHE COME FROM?

23:26.113 --> 23:27.697
{\an8}IT'S NOT FUNNY ANYMORE.

23:27.781 --> 23:28.782
{\an8}- BRO, I'M SCARED.

23:28.865 --> 23:32.327
{\an8}MAN, THERE'S A STALKER
OF ALL STALKERS.

23:32.410 --> 23:35.205
{\an8}I CANNOT LOOK TO MY RIGHT
WITHOUT THIS GIRL BEING THERE.

23:35.288 --> 23:37.124
{\an8}- SHE WANTS TO BE
A STALKER.

23:37.207 --> 23:38.333
{\an8}SHE DON'T WANNA BE YOUR GIRL.

23:38.416 --> 23:40.168
{\an8}LIKE, SHE WANTS TO BE
YOUR STALKER.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.461
{\an8}- LIKE, VINNY,
I GOTTA KEEP MOVING.

23:41.545 --> 23:42.504

23:42.587 --> 23:45.173
{\an8}YO, WHERE'D SHE GO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.883
{\an8}- I'M SCARED.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.969
{\an8}- WANNA PLAY POOL?
- ALL RIGHT.

24:03.108 --> 24:06.278
{\an8}- WHAT THE FUCK?

24:06.361 --> 24:08.864
{\an8}WHERE IS EVERYBODY?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

24:08.947 --> 24:10.198
{\an8}THEY JUST LEFT?

24:10.282 --> 24:11.700
{\an8}I SOMETIMES ISOLATE MYSELF.

24:11.783 --> 24:12.993
{\an8}I DO LIKE TO BE ALONE
SOMETIMES,

24:13.076 --> 24:16.079
{\an8}BUT I ALSO LIKE TO KNOW
THAT PEOPLE CARE.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.747
{\an8}KIDDING ME?

24:17.831 --> 24:19.791
{\an8}THIS WHOLE SUMMER,
BEEN NOTHING BUT NICE.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.669
{\an8}IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER,
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY,

24:22.752 --> 24:25.297
{\an8}NO MATTER HOW NICE I AM,
THE NICE GUY GETS STEPPED ON.

24:25.380 --> 24:26.548
{\an8}SO SOONER OR LATER,
THE BAD GUY'S GONNA COME OUT.

24:35.932 --> 24:38.894
{\an8}- THERE'S PAULY'S STALKER.
- STOP, DUDE, GET OUT OF HERE!

24:38.977 --> 24:41.563
{\an8}- AHH!
YO, WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW?

24:41.646 --> 24:43.398
{\an8}THERE'S A WAR OUT THERE.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.575
{\an8}- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

24:53.658 --> 24:55.410
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I'M NOT STAYING HOME.

24:55.493 --> 24:58.413
{\an8}- ARE YOU DOWN FOR 507?
- WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

24:58.496 --> 25:00.415
{\an8}- OOH.

25:02.292 --> 25:03.752
{\an8}- YO, MIKE!

{\an8}- YEAH.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.593
{\an8}- I AM VERY CONFUSED
RIGHT NOW.

25:11.676 --> 25:14.554
{\an8}NICOLE IS ACTING
LIKE SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

25:14.638 --> 25:16.264
{\an8}- I'M HAPPY YOU'RE COMING OUT,
'CAUSE LAST NIGHT,

25:16.348 --> 25:17.557
{\an8}YOU FELL ASLEEP,
AND YOU ANNOYED ME.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.851
{\an8}I HAVE A U.T.I.
I'M STILL CHUGGING ALONG.

25:19.935 --> 25:23.021
{\an8}- ALTHOUGH IN THE BACK OF
MY HEAD, I HAVE PLANS OF DEMISE,

25:23.104 --> 25:25.982
{\an8}I'LL GO WITH HER TO GET A DRINK,
SEE WHAT'S UP.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.776
{\an8}- YOU OKAY?

25:27.859 --> 25:29.569
{\an8}- I DIDN'T SLEEP LAST NIGHT
'CAUSE I WAS SO PISSED OFF.

25:29.653 --> 25:31.071
{\an8}I JUST LAID HERE.

25:31.154 --> 25:32.614
{\an8}ME AND ROGER ARE FIGHTING
RIGHT NOW.

25:32.697 --> 25:37.244
{\an8}HE CALLED IN SICK
OVER MISPLACING HIS PHONE,

{\an8}- EVERYWHERE WE GO,
EVERYWHERE WE TURN,

27:04.497 --> 27:07.208
{\an8}THERE'S PAULY'S STALKER
RIGHT BEHIND US.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.460
{\an8}WE DON'T KNOW
HOW SHE GETS THERE,

27:08.543 --> 27:10.211
{\an8}HOW SHE KNOWS WHERE WE ARE.

27:10.295 --> 27:11.379
{\an8}YOU, COME HERE.

{\an8}WE THINK THAT SHE SNUCK A GPS
SYSTEM INTO PAULY'S BLOWOUT,

{\an8}AND THAT'S HOW SHE KNOWS
WHERE HE IS EVERY TIME.

TO SAY HELLO TO YOU.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.728
{\an8}- HELLO.

{\an8}- VANESSA.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.900
{\an8}SO, PAULY, YOU'RE WELCOME.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

27:31.983 --> 27:33.651
{\an8}- YOU'RE WELCOME.
I'LL LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE NOW.

27:33.735 --> 27:35.236
{\an8}- THAT'S MY SISTER'S NAME--

- OH, MY GOD.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.847
{\an8}FAIR TO SAY,
VINNY WON THIS BATTLE,

28:02.931 --> 28:04.432
{\an8}BUT HE WILL NOT WIN THE WAR.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.643
{\an8}I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DID THAT TO ME, BRO.

28:06.726 --> 28:09.229

33:54.782 --> 33:59.120
{\an8}- OH, ARE YOU SAYING THAT--

33:59.203 --> 34:02.039
{\an8}SO, UH, YOU'RE SAYING THAT,

{\an8}- [laughing]
YOU'RE PRETTY PERCEPTIVE,

34:06.002 --> 34:07.462
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

34:07.545 --> 34:11.424
{\an8}- I AM GETTING INFORMATION THAT
IT'S BECOMING THE SMASH AND DASH

34:11.507 --> 34:12.842
{\an8}WITH DEENA'S SISTER.

34:12.925 --> 34:15.386
{\an8}I GUESS I GOTTA COMMEND HIM AND
GIVE HIM A PAT ON THE BACK, MAN,

34:15.469 --> 34:18.139
{\an8}'CAUSE, UH, YOU KNOW,
HE'S NEVER BEEN LIKE THAT.

34:18.222 --> 34:21.976
{\an8}REALLY?
FUCKING NO.

34:22.059 --> 34:24.937
{\an8}HE SAID THEY FUCKING HAD
AN AWESOME FUCKIN' FIRST DATE.

34:25.021 --> 34:26.647
{\an8}- WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?
- UNIT.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.315
{\an8}- ABOUT MY SISTER
AND YOUR BROTHER?

34:28.399 --> 34:30.193
{\an8}- YEAH, HE KNOWS WHAT'S UP.
- OH.

34:30.275 --> 34:31.569
{\an8}I AM A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED
THAT MY SISTER AND FRANK

34:31.652 --> 34:33.654
{\an8}ARE STILL AN ITEM.

34:33.737 --> 34:35.114
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW IF I REALLY
AM PLEASED

34:35.197 --> 34:37.241
{\an8}WITH BEING IN MIKE'S FAMILY.

34:37.324 --> 34:39.284
{\an8}I MEAN, HE'S BEEN NICE
SO FAR, BUT...

34:39.368 --> 34:41.871
{\an8}A LEOPARD NEVER SHEDS
ITS STRIPES.

34:41.954 --> 34:45.291
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.

34:45.373 --> 34:47.585
{\an8}- THAT WAS A PRETTY GOOD
PHONE CALL.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.837
{\an8}YO.

34:49.920 --> 34:50.505
{\an8}- OH!

34:50.588 --> 34:53.507

34:54.842 --> 34:56.302
{\an8}UGH!

{\an8}- HELLO?

34:58.763 --> 35:00.139
{\an8}- YES?

{\an8}[duck quacking]

35:10.107 --> 35:11.192

{\an8}- YES?

35:16.489 --> 35:17.865
{\an8}- OH, OKAY.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.368
{\an8}UH, YEAH, I WAS ACTUALLY
TALKING TO MY BOYS AND SHIT.

35:20.451 --> 35:23.204
{\an8}AND, UM, I MEAN, THE WORD IS,
YOU KNOW,

35:23.287 --> 35:25.665
{\an8}HE HAD AN AWESOME TIME
ON THE FIRST DATE.

35:25.748 --> 35:27.542
{\an8}- NO, HE'S A GREAT GUY.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.210
{\an8}I MEAN, I DO WANNA
SEE HIM AGAIN.

35:29.293 --> 35:30.294
{\an8}I DEFINITELY DO.

35:30.378 --> 35:31.754
{\an8}- HOW MUCH DO YOU GUYS TALK?

35:31.838 --> 35:33.464
{\an8}- ALMOST, LIKE, EVERY DAY,
EVERY OTHER DAY.

35:33.548 --> 35:37.426
{\an8}- THAT'S COOL, BUT HE JUST
GOT OUT OF A LONG RELATIONSHIP

35:37.510 --> 35:41.097
{\an8}AND STUFF, SO HE POSSIBLY COULD
HAVE HIS GUARD UP, POSSIBLY.

35:41.180 --> 35:42.223
{\an8}- MM-HMM.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.933
{\an8}- AT THE SAME TIME,
I KNOW HE LIKES YOU.

35:44.016 --> 35:46.102
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
NO, I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

35:46.185 --> 35:48.521
{\an8}- NO, ONLY BECAUSE I WANT THINGS
TO WORK OUT BETWEEN YOU GUYS.

35:48.604 --> 35:50.481
{\an8}I THINK IT'S KINDA CUTE.
- AWW. THANK YOU.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.024
{\an8}- I WANT IT TO CONTINUE
TO GO ON

35:52.108 --> 35:53.651
{\an8}FOR ME TO FIND OUT
SOME MORE DIRT

35:53.734 --> 35:55.236
{\an8}AND HAVE SOME MORE FUN.

35:55.319 --> 35:57.572
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

35:57.655 --> 36:01.242
{\an8}- TELL YOUR SISTER THAT I SPOKE
TO YOU AND THAT I'M VERY NICE.

36:01.325 --> 36:03.119
{\an8}'CAUSE SHE THINKS
I'M THE DEVIL.

36:03.202 --> 36:04.662
{\an8}- OH, NO.
I'LL TELL HER.

36:04.745 --> 36:06.747
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT, THANKS, MIKE.

36:06.831 --> 36:09.750

{\an8}- OKAY.
- YEAH!

36:15.798 --> 36:18.301
{\an8}- OH, WHY DOES IT DO THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

36:21.762 --> 36:24.599
{\an8}- YO, I JUST SPOKE
TO YOUR SISTER, DEENA.

36:24.682 --> 36:25.558
{\an8}- OH, YEAH?
- YEAH. ALL'S GOOD.

36:25.641 --> 36:27.935
{\an8}- OH, REALLY?

36:28.019 --> 36:28.978
{\an8}- I'M LIKE, "YOUR SISTER
THINKS I'M THE DEVIL,

36:29.061 --> 36:31.439
{\an8}SO NEXT TIME YOU
SPEAK TO HER--"

36:31.522 --> 36:33.107
{\an8}- O-KAY.
- YEAH.

36:33.190 --> 36:34.275
{\an8}- I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE THE DEVIL, MIKE.

36:34.358 --> 36:38.029
{\an8}I JUST THINK SOMETIMES
YOU CAN BE DEVILISH.

36:38.112 --> 36:39.614
{\an8}- YES.

36:39.697 --> 36:41.407
{\an8}- UNTIL HE PROVES ME WRONG,

36:41.490 --> 36:44.076
{\an8}I WILL ALWAYS BE ON MY TOES
WHEN IT COMES TO MIKE.

36:59.425 --> 37:00.968
{\an8}- HOW'VE YOU BEEN?
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.387
{\an8}- AH, JENNI'S FLIPPING, DUDE.

37:03.471 --> 37:05.222
{\an8}I'M NOT KISSING HER ASS.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

37:05.306 --> 37:07.683
{\an8}- ME AND PAULY SEE ROGER
AT THE GYM,

37:07.767 --> 37:09.852
{\an8}AND, UH, ROGER DOESN'T
SEEM HAPPY.

37:09.936 --> 37:11.312
{\an8}- I DON'T PLAY THAT GAME,
BRO.

37:11.395 --> 37:12.855
{\an8}DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE
A 15-YEAR-OLD ON THE PHONE

37:12.939 --> 37:14.398
{\an8}AND THINK I'M GONNA
KISS YOUR ASS.

37:14.482 --> 37:16.317
{\an8}AND THEN SLAMS THE PHONE DOWN
BEFORE I CAN SAY ANYTHING BACK.

37:16.400 --> 37:17.735
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

37:17.818 --> 37:18.903
{\an8}I'M NOT A LITTLE KID.
DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT.

37:18.986 --> 37:21.739
{\an8}- SHE CAN DO THAT
WITH THE OTHER ONE, NOT YOU.

37:21.822 --> 37:23.449
{\an8}- SHE WANTS TO GROW UP,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

37:23.532 --> 37:24.659
{\an8}PICK UP THE FUCKING PHONE.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.285
{\an8}BUT YOU'RE GONNA THINK
I'M CALLING?

37:26.369 --> 37:27.828
{\an8}YOU'RE GONNA BE WAITING A LONG
TIME FOR THAT PHONE TO RING.

37:27.912 --> 37:28.996
{\an8}- RIGHT, RIGHT.
- I DON'T PLAY THAT GAME, BRO.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.748
{\an8}I'M GOOD TO MY GIRL.
I TREAT HER LIKE GOLD.

37:30.831 --> 37:33.542
{\an8}IF SHE'S GONNA ACT LIKE I DON'T,
SELL THAT STORY SOMEWHERE ELSE.

37:33.626 --> 37:36.337
{\an8}- I ACTUALLY TAKE ROGER'S SIDE,
BECAUSE ROGER'S A COOL GUY.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.839
{\an8}HE'S AN ADULT.
HE DOESN'T PLAY GAMES.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.591
{\an8}I KNOW THAT JENNI'S
JUST BEING STUBBORN,

37:40.675 --> 37:43.302
{\an8}AND SHE'S GONNA HAVE TO GROW UP
AND CALL ROGER BACK.

37:43.386 --> 37:44.679
{\an8}COMING OUT TONIGHT?

37:44.762 --> 37:45.805
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
WE'LL SEE WHAT'S UP.

37:45.888 --> 37:47.014
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHERE WE'LL BE AT.

37:47.098 --> 37:49.183
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, BOYS.
- LATER.

37:49.266 --> 37:52.019
{\an8}MAN, ROGER DON'T PLAY AROUND,
DOES HE?

38:04.448 --> 38:08.786
{\an8}- SAW ROGER AT THE GYM TODAY.
- WHAT'D HE SAY?

38:08.869 --> 38:11.038
{\an8}- DO I TELL YOU?
[laughing]

38:11.122 --> 38:12.748
{\an8}HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BAD.
- WHAT?

38:12.832 --> 38:15.042
{\an8}- MORE LIKE A MESSAGE.
- WHAT?

38:15.126 --> 38:16.585
{\an8}- NOTHING, I WAS LIKE,
"WHERE YOU BEEN?"

38:16.669 --> 38:18.796
{\an8}HE'S LIKE, "JUST GOING AT IT
WITH JENNI A LITTLE BIT."

38:18.879 --> 38:22.216
{\an8}HE'S LIKE, "YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT A LITTLE KID ANYMORE.

38:22.299 --> 38:24.385
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
WAITING FOR THE PHONE."

38:24.468 --> 38:25.886
{\an8}LIKE YOU KNOW, LIKE--

38:25.970 --> 38:27.722
{\an8}BASICALLY,
SAID THE USUAL ROGER THING,

38:27.805 --> 38:30.391
{\an8}HE'S A MATURE GUY...
- NOW I NEED A CIGARETTE.

38:30.474 --> 38:32.059
{\an8}- HE DOESN'T WANT GAMES
AND SHIT.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.227
{\an8}HE JUST--

38:33.310 --> 38:34.937
{\an8}- I THINK YOU'RE BEING STUPID
NOT CALLING HIM.

38:35.021 --> 38:36.647
{\an8}- YEAH, YOU'RE BEING--
YOU SHOULD CALL HIM.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.607
{\an8}LIKE HE'S--
- ALL RIGHT.

38:38.691 --> 38:40.401
{\an8}I STILL THINK ROGER'S
IN THE WRONG.

38:40.484 --> 38:42.611
{\an8}I'M GONNA CALL HIM,
ALL IS FORGIVEN,

38:42.695 --> 38:44.405
{\an8}AND WE'LL GO OUT
AND HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

38:44.488 --> 38:47.450

I JUST WANTED TO APOLOGIZE

38:51.037 --> 38:55.082
{\an8}FOR THAT PHONE CALL.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.418
{\an8}- FIRST OF ALL,
I DID NOTHING WRONG.

FOR ANYTHING I DID.

{\an8}BUT YOU'D BE SITTING BY
THAT PHONE FOR A LIFETIME

AND KISS YOUR ASS.
