00:00.043 --> 00:03.202
- Hey!
- So you went on a date with my teacher?!

00:03.203 --> 00:04.203
I didn't know!

00:04.893 --> 00:07.292
We wish you and James the very best too

00:07.293 --> 00:11.322
and hopefully, it will be
peace and quiet from now on.

00:11.323 --> 00:13.712
So many of my friends were
going and it meant that Connor

00:13.713 --> 00:15.482
could meet them before the wedding.

00:16.283 --> 00:17.523
_

00:17.853 --> 00:18.864
- Are we going?
- Going where?

00:18.865 --> 00:20.752
- Dad's.
- What? To stay?

00:20.753 --> 00:22.532
He's not going anywhere!

00:22.533 --> 00:23.752
TOM!

00:23.753 --> 00:25.672
Why has he gone to his dad's?

00:25.673 --> 00:27.122
He says he doesn't love you.

00:27.123 --> 00:29.042
What are you going do about Gemma?

00:29.043 --> 00:30.972
She thinks you're
scheming to make her leave

00:30.973 --> 00:33.222
and she doesn't understand
why Tom has moved in with you.

00:33.223 --> 00:34.491
What she did wasn't fair.

00:34.492 --> 00:36.737
- It wasn't justice, simply revenge.
- Mate...

00:36.745 --> 00:38.860
So would you blame me if
when I get an opportunity,

00:38.863 --> 00:42.472
I look for a way to get my son
back and remove her from my life?

00:42.693 --> 00:43.822
Tom!

00:43.823 --> 00:45.362
Tom's been in a fight.

00:45.363 --> 00:47.992
But from what witnesses are
saying, it was more like an attack.

00:47.993 --> 00:51.362
- Who attacked him?
- He attacked another boy. Max Gosford.

01:07.443 --> 01:10.402
- Everything all right?
- Sorry?

01:10.403 --> 01:12.232
With the food?

01:12.233 --> 01:13.632
Can we get the bill?

01:13.633 --> 01:15.372
Sure.

01:21.553 --> 01:22.592
Why?

01:25.413 --> 01:27.842
You've never done anything like this.

01:29.853 --> 01:31.072
He asked for it.

01:32.953 --> 01:36.092
Are you saying that he provoked you?

01:36.093 --> 01:39.842
I mean, did he hit you
first? Did he say something?

01:43.783 --> 01:45.182
Isobel.

01:45.183 --> 01:48.602
OK. What about Isobel?

01:53.253 --> 01:56.038
- She hates you.
- What?

01:56.039 --> 01:58.352
Isobel hates you cos of
what you did to her mum.

01:58.453 --> 01:59.812
What's this got to do with...

01:59.813 --> 02:02.012
Her mum said you bullied
her when she worked for you.

02:02.013 --> 02:04.072
- We were all under pressure.
- No shit.

02:04.073 --> 02:06.142
- Don't swear, mate.
- Why should I listen to you?

02:06.143 --> 02:07.572
You pushed Mum through a glass window.

02:07.573 --> 02:09.049
I didn't push her through the window.

02:09.050 --> 02:10.919
My mistake, you didn't
push her through the window,

02:10.923 --> 02:12.562
you just smashed her head into it.

02:12.563 --> 02:15.892
Whatever happened, I don't
think you're in a position

02:15.893 --> 02:17.672
to tell us what to do right now.

02:17.673 --> 02:18.932
- Can I go to the car?
- No.

02:18.933 --> 02:20.580
I want to go to the
car, I've had enough.

02:20.581 --> 02:21.932
- Whose car?
- Dad's.

02:21.933 --> 02:24.942
That doesn't mean that I like him
best, it's just where my stuff is.

02:24.943 --> 02:29.342
Just give me the keys,
or I'll walk off anyway.

02:44.063 --> 02:47.062
There's more to this. He wouldn't
just beat up his best friend.

02:48.373 --> 02:52.502
He said Isobel. Presumably,
they were fighting over her.

02:52.503 --> 02:54.752
- So you're not surprised.
- Of course I'm surprised.

02:54.753 --> 02:57.232
I would have expected more
control, but he's growing up

02:57.233 --> 02:59.582
and this has been a particularly
frustrating time for him.

02:59.583 --> 03:00.702
Well, that's true.

03:00.703 --> 03:02.632
- Yes, it is.
- And it's not fair.

03:09.423 --> 03:13.452
You told him something. And
now he won't even look at me.

03:15.613 --> 03:17.582
What was it?

03:17.583 --> 03:19.222
No, actually, it doesn't matter.

03:19.223 --> 03:21.852
Because from now on, I don't care
what you're planning to hurt me

03:21.853 --> 03:26.022
or get rid of me, we
support him together.

03:27.423 --> 03:29.912
He needs stability, guidance.

03:29.913 --> 03:34.602
So either you step out
and leave me to it, or...

03:34.603 --> 03:36.002
... work with me.

03:38.823 --> 03:40.322
Of course. We're his parents.

03:42.943 --> 03:45.942
Together. Absolutely.

03:53.303 --> 03:55.224
- I'll get this.
- No, it's fine.

03:55.225 --> 03:57.012
- Please.
- No.

04:01.653 --> 04:02.722
Shall I split it?

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -

05:19.621 --> 05:20.640
Gemma?

05:21.771 --> 05:23.550
Hey.

05:26.091 --> 05:27.210
New start?

05:28.761 --> 05:31.620
Yeah, sorting out a flat. Single again.

05:31.621 --> 05:33.210
Make the most of it.

05:33.211 --> 05:34.340
It sounds good.

05:36.351 --> 05:37.480
Are you OK?

05:37.481 --> 05:38.840
Shall we have some wine?

05:39.821 --> 05:42.960
I know it's only five o'clock,
but I could open a bottle.

05:44.091 --> 05:47.180
Tom's been in trouble today, so
I've got a few things to sort out.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.529
- Trouble?
- He attacked Max.

05:49.530 --> 05:51.720
- He...
- Hit him. Knocked him to the ground.

05:51.821 --> 05:53.460
- Oh, my God! Why?
- I don't know.

05:53.461 --> 05:56.280
- Have you tried asking him?
- He wouldn't tell me.

05:56.281 --> 05:57.820
Maybe ask again?

05:57.861 --> 06:02.460
Look, er, anything I can do...

06:02.461 --> 06:06.920
- Same for you. If I can help...
- Try you for that wine later.

06:06.921 --> 06:09.640
- Sounds like you might need it.
- Yeah. Thanks.

06:24.871 --> 06:28.340
<i>You have one new message.
First new message.</i>

06:28.341 --> 06:31.110
ROS: <i>Hi! It's me. I'm really
looking forward to tomorrow!</i>

06:31.111 --> 06:33.730
<i>I don't want to know what
we're doing. Love a surprise.</i>

06:33.731 --> 06:37.670
<i>But I just wondered if I needed
to bring anything specific.</i>

06:37.671 --> 06:39.590
<i>Dress up or whatever? Let me know!</i>

06:39.591 --> 06:42.080
<i>And also just to say that apparently</i>

06:42.081 --> 06:45.830
<i>we can have confetti outside,
but it needs to be biodegradable.</i>

06:45.831 --> 06:48.260
<i>I'm sure you're on this
but can you let people know?</i>

06:48.261 --> 06:49.900
<i>Anyway, call me about tomorrow.</i>

06:49.901 --> 06:53.510
<i>Let me know where to be. Exciting! Bye!</i>

KEY RATTLING IN DOOR

07:20.611 --> 07:24.310
Hi! I thought you were at your dad's?

07:28.671 --> 07:30.640
Tom, are you all right?

07:31.041 --> 07:33.550
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

07:33.551 --> 07:38.850
Well, then, let me cook
something. Just be a minute.

07:47.661 --> 07:49.110
What's happened?

07:53.801 --> 07:55.680
Tom?

07:57.831 --> 08:00.040
I had an argument with Dad in the car.

08:00.041 --> 08:02.000
When we got back, I
grabbed my bike and left.

08:02.201 --> 08:04.160
An argument? What about?

08:04.161 --> 08:05.750
He said I should move schools.

08:05.751 --> 08:08.470
Move schools? Why would you do that?

08:08.471 --> 08:11.100
I don't know, he just wouldn't
stop going on about it.

08:15.041 --> 08:18.130
Tom, you can tell me anything, you know.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.400
DOORBELL RINGS

08:26.941 --> 08:28.400
Does he know where you are?

08:30.181 --> 08:32.289
DOORBELL RINGS AGAIN

08:33.510 --> 08:35.340
I'm not getting it.

08:38.520 --> 08:40.960
DOORBELL RINGS

08:50.101 --> 08:51.650
- Why ring the bell?
- What?

08:51.651 --> 08:54.040
I thought you had a key.

08:54.041 --> 08:55.590
Right.

08:55.591 --> 08:57.740
Here. Have it.

08:59.481 --> 09:01.070
- Can I come in?
- You told him to move schools.

09:01.071 --> 09:02.200
Yes, because...

09:02.201 --> 09:05.010
Another local school.
I think it's an option.

09:05.011 --> 09:07.030
Simon, all his friends are there.

09:07.031 --> 09:09.740
I said he should consider it,
but, fine, if he doesn't want to.

09:09.741 --> 09:11.150
No, what he needs is our support,

09:11.151 --> 09:13.400
not getting into arguments
and telling him what to do.

09:13.401 --> 09:15.600
I know, and I'm here to apologise.

09:15.601 --> 09:19.640
My mistake. I love Tom. OK?
I don't want to hurt him.

09:23.851 --> 09:24.860
Just you.

09:25.361 --> 09:27.312
- He doesn't want to see you.
- I should apologise.

09:27.314 --> 09:28.820
- I'll tell him.
- Better in person.

09:30.511 --> 09:32.390
I thought we were putting him first?

09:43.221 --> 09:44.480
DOOR SHUTS

09:44.481 --> 09:47.250
- Why did you let him in?
- Your dad wants to talk to you.

09:47.251 --> 09:50.340
To say sorry, mate. I don't
know how we ended up arguing.

09:50.341 --> 09:52.533
- You do.
- OK.

09:52.534 --> 09:54.090
You do know. You said
I should move schools.

09:54.091 --> 09:57.510
Well, I said you should consider
it, bearing in mind what's happened.

09:57.511 --> 09:58.690
Mum says I don't have to.

09:58.691 --> 10:01.120
You don't have to, but
people will be talking and...

10:01.121 --> 10:03.050
It's just a fight. They'll forget it.

10:03.051 --> 10:05.620
- I doubt Max will, mate...
- Can you stop calling me mate?

10:05.621 --> 10:07.030
I'm not your mate, I'm your son.

10:07.031 --> 10:09.510
I always call you mate.

10:09.511 --> 10:10.640
I know.

10:12.521 --> 10:13.640
OK.

10:16.641 --> 10:20.340
- And what's this with Isobel?
- Can you stop? It doesn't matter.

10:20.341 --> 10:21.334
- Nothing.
- You said...

10:21.335 --> 10:22.824
- No, I didn't.
- At the wedding party,

10:22.825 --> 10:24.380
the two of you looked close.

10:24.381 --> 10:25.500
What are you doing?

10:25.501 --> 10:26.810
Just trying to establish...

10:26.811 --> 10:29.530
Yeah, well, it might seem like
we're close to you, but we're not.

10:29.531 --> 10:31.155
Things were different
than when you were young.

10:31.456 --> 10:32.490
You saw them, right?

10:32.491 --> 10:33.646
Mum always sees me together

10:33.647 --> 10:35.460
- with my friends, we're just...
- If Tom says he's not with Isobel,

10:35.471 --> 10:36.719
then I believe him.

10:36.781 --> 10:37.941
As always.

10:37.942 --> 10:39.660
- What?
- You always believe him.

10:39.661 --> 10:41.110
Always been the problem.

10:41.111 --> 10:43.780
Ever since he was small, you
let him get away with anything.

10:43.781 --> 10:46.080
All right, well, look, mate...

10:46.081 --> 10:48.380
Oh, OK, yes, mate?

10:48.381 --> 10:50.250
Sorry. Can we put this behind us?

10:50.251 --> 10:52.770
Yeah, OK, fine. So you can go now.

10:52.971 --> 10:54.000
You're going to stay here tonight?

10:54.001 --> 10:55.780
Yes.

10:56.121 --> 10:58.030
Tom!

10:58.031 --> 11:00.050
TOM STOMPS UPSTAIRS

11:04.221 --> 11:06.050
OK, well, I should leave.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.640
Should I go up after him?

11:15.151 --> 11:17.580
Wow. OK.

11:22.461 --> 11:23.960
Thanks.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.650
You saw him at the party with
Isobel with his arm round her.

11:34.651 --> 11:37.180
Simon, he's telling you
they're not together.

11:37.181 --> 11:39.100
But it's possible, isn't it?

11:39.101 --> 11:40.564
That whatever's happened,

11:40.565 --> 11:43.270
he thinks lying is the
way to make it better?

11:43.271 --> 11:45.050
And before you point out the obvious,

11:45.051 --> 11:46.460
yes, I speak from experience.

11:46.461 --> 11:48.050
Do you want to stay for dinner?

11:49.411 --> 11:52.550
- What?
- Chicken, pasta, broccoli. Basic.

11:54.621 --> 11:56.120
Is this a trick?

11:56.121 --> 11:57.430
What?

11:57.431 --> 12:00.710
You're going to put something in
the food, drug me or something.

12:00.711 --> 12:02.630
Bury my body in the garden.

12:02.631 --> 12:04.230
What makes you think this is a trick?

12:04.231 --> 12:07.420
Because I'm me and you're you,
and suddenly you're being nice.

12:09.901 --> 12:11.070
No, this isn't a trick.

12:11.071 --> 12:13.420
This is a chance to sort things out.

12:13.421 --> 12:15.670
Right now, Tom needs to
feel like he has both of us.

12:15.671 --> 12:19.600
So rest assured, the beer, the
dinner, I'll be gritting my teeth.

12:23.821 --> 12:26.260
Dinner would be great.

12:26.261 --> 12:27.670
MOBILE RINGS

12:27.671 --> 12:28.790
Shit. Sorry.

12:31.421 --> 12:36.810
Hey. Yeah. No. Work
to do, in the office.

12:36.811 --> 12:37.980
Yeah, I might be a while.

13:00.611 --> 13:02.640
- MOBILE BUZZES
- _

13:02.641 --> 13:04.330
Shit!

13:10.191 --> 13:13.230
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Fine.

13:13.231 --> 13:14.690
- You lied to her.
- I protected her.

13:15.891 --> 13:17.500
And so it begins.

13:18.721 --> 13:21.340
How is she generally? Happy?

13:21.341 --> 13:22.602
Yeah. Just,

13:23.003 --> 13:24.503
young child, you know.

13:24.721 --> 13:27.530
That's a bit unfair.
She's what, 23, 24 by now?

13:27.531 --> 13:29.450
We've got a young child.

13:29.451 --> 13:30.580
Oh, I see.

13:45.391 --> 13:49.190
I dream about this house.

13:49.191 --> 13:53.130
Sometimes Kate's here. Sometimes you.

13:53.131 --> 13:56.410
There's a story with everything.

13:56.411 --> 13:59.645
We chose this rug, we got that
picture in France, you remember?

13:59.646 --> 14:00.955
Of course.

14:00.956 --> 14:04.335
We revarnished the
banister. Well, you did.

14:04.336 --> 14:05.455
I watched.

14:10.526 --> 14:13.805
- I fucked you over this counter.
- What?

14:13.806 --> 14:15.815
I saw you remember it just now.

14:15.816 --> 14:17.695
I saw it in your face. You remembered.

14:17.696 --> 14:20.505
- Didn't you?
- No.

14:20.506 --> 14:22.145
- You didn't fuck me.
- I think I did.

14:22.146 --> 14:24.535
It was consensual. I'd say
I was an active participant.

14:24.536 --> 14:26.455
I'd say usually you
were very active, yes,

14:26.456 --> 14:30.395
but occasionally you
preferred it being done to you.

14:30.396 --> 14:32.835
- This was one of those times.
- Why would you mention that?

14:32.836 --> 14:34.285
Why would you think about it?

14:37.566 --> 14:39.495
We should check his pictures.

14:39.496 --> 14:41.555
I can do it on here. His photo stream.

14:41.556 --> 14:44.085
- Might help us know what's going on.
- You need his password.

14:44.086 --> 14:45.865
I've got his password. Haven't you?

14:45.866 --> 14:47.688
How is he supposed to trust us when
we're looking at things like that?

14:47.690 --> 14:50.532
He's a child. Our child.

14:50.533 --> 14:51.635
He's just beaten his best friend up

14:51.676 --> 14:54.685
and he won't tell us why.
So we have to work it out.

14:56.936 --> 14:59.795
No. I'm not doing that. He
can be honest with us instead.

15:05.086 --> 15:06.305
MOBILE VIBRATES

15:06.346 --> 15:09.255
His details. In case
you change your mind.

15:11.706 --> 15:13.435
Tom! Dinner!

15:13.436 --> 15:15.635
Shall I sort out the table?

15:15.636 --> 15:18.075
Thanks.

15:20.226 --> 15:23.795
So who's this new guy? Tom
says it's one of his teachers.

15:23.796 --> 15:26.235
I didn't know that when we met.

15:26.236 --> 15:28.155
Is it serious?

15:28.156 --> 15:30.025
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

15:31.806 --> 15:33.545
Your dad's staying for dinner.

15:33.546 --> 15:34.995
Er, why?

15:34.996 --> 15:38.325
Because you've got enough to worry
about without arguing with your dad,

15:38.326 --> 15:40.855
and after what you've done
today, you don't get a vote,

15:40.856 --> 15:44.235
so sit down, eat, and
we'll work it out together.

15:44.236 --> 15:46.345
Well, that won't go wrong.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.875
You said you were hungry. Here's food.

15:48.876 --> 15:52.295
Are you not having a glass of wine?

15:52.296 --> 15:56.515
What? No. You want one?

15:56.516 --> 15:59.095
No, I'm fine.

16:00.546 --> 16:03.825
- What?
- Well, you always have a glass of wine.

16:03.826 --> 16:06.495
- Nearly always.
- Do you two talk about me?

16:06.496 --> 16:08.935
- Not much.
- That I'm an alcoholic.

16:08.936 --> 16:10.675
No, just what you're like generally.

16:10.676 --> 16:13.065
And what am I like?

16:13.066 --> 16:14.375
Well, if you want something

16:14.376 --> 16:16.765
and someone's stopping you
from getting it, you go like

16:16.766 --> 16:18.545
the Terminator or something.

16:20.846 --> 16:22.535
Well, right now, I want the truth.

16:24.576 --> 16:26.795
What? I told you, there wasn't anything.

16:26.796 --> 16:28.675
I want to know why you hit Max.

16:28.676 --> 16:31.765
What that had to do with
Isobel. Complete honesty.

16:31.766 --> 16:33.075
So we can help.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.935
Your dad was right. You were
close with Isobel at the party.

16:35.936 --> 16:39.035
- Close because we're friends, why... ?
- Enough.

16:41.186 --> 16:44.565
Me and Isobel, we're not like that.
We've never kissed or anything.

16:44.566 --> 16:48.225
We've known each other for
years. It would be weird.

16:48.226 --> 16:49.295
So what, then?

16:50.796 --> 16:54.035
It's just, Max is into her.

16:54.036 --> 16:57.125
Doesn't like that she talks
to me. Suddenly, he goes crazy.

16:57.126 --> 16:58.395
Started shouting at me.

16:59.706 --> 17:02.235
So I told him to shut up, then, yeah.

17:02.236 --> 17:04.204
- Got into a fight.
- All right.

17:04.205 --> 17:06.785
So we should tell the school
that Max was shouting at you.

17:06.786 --> 17:09.125
That he was jealous. You don't mind?

17:09.126 --> 17:11.285
- No.
- I called them.

17:11.286 --> 17:13.815
Karen can meet us tomorrow
at 10.30 to discuss it.

17:13.816 --> 17:15.708
- Do you want to be there?
- Of course.

17:15.709 --> 17:16.709
Tom?

17:16.715 --> 17:18.964
- Do I have to be?
- No.

17:19.066 --> 17:21.595
- Then no.
- Fine.

17:21.596 --> 17:22.915
So we're going to tell them

17:22.915 --> 17:24.885
that you'll make a
personal apology to Max,

17:24.886 --> 17:27.135
and there's no need for
any further punishment.

17:27.136 --> 17:28.255
And you've got your exams coming up,

17:28.256 --> 17:29.999
so the sooner you get
back in school, the better.

17:30.366 --> 17:32.295
And we should be strong about that.

17:33.766 --> 17:34.945
Absolutely.

17:40.396 --> 17:42.785
Ha! I remember this.

17:44.056 --> 17:47.525
That's your glass. You
always had that at dinner.

17:47.526 --> 17:49.775
- Is it?
- Yeah.

17:51.176 --> 17:53.005
It's coincidence.

18:05.606 --> 18:06.663
Night.

18:06.664 --> 18:08.575
- Night.
- Night, mate.

18:08.576 --> 18:11.005
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

18:36.696 --> 18:38.805
LOUD MUSIC PLAYS UPSTAIRS

19:35.436 --> 19:37.455
Thanks.

19:41.116 --> 19:42.235
No problem.

19:46.076 --> 19:47.255
What?

20:19.226 --> 20:20.395
Gemma.

20:26.916 --> 20:28.035
Go on, then.

20:36.476 --> 20:37.695
No.

20:46.316 --> 20:47.535
Stop.

21:57.156 --> 22:00.575
Disappointing.

22:00.576 --> 22:03.105
Desperate.

22:06.056 --> 22:07.655
To show Kate?

22:11.026 --> 22:13.185
Pathetic.

22:13.186 --> 22:15.905
You really would have gone that far?

22:15.906 --> 22:17.915
I would have stopped you at some point.

22:19.466 --> 22:20.825
Once I got what I needed.

22:23.926 --> 22:26.448
But now we're here...

22:26.449 --> 22:28.988
we could keep going.

22:36.199 --> 22:40.278
Surely this was the whole point?

22:43.709 --> 22:44.968
We've started now.

22:50.409 --> 22:51.578
Gemma, I hate you.

22:53.779 --> 22:58.888
I know. I pretty much
fucking loathe you too.

23:01.239 --> 23:03.528
MUSIC CONTINUES UPSTAIRS

24:53.469 --> 24:54.918
See you tomorrow.

24:58.569 --> 25:00.448
At the school? 10.30?

25:02.559 --> 25:03.638
Right.

25:31.999 --> 25:35.278
Tom's problems. Needed to sort them out.

25:35.279 --> 25:37.248
You don't have to explain.

25:38.379 --> 25:39.458
Has Neil gone?

25:40.719 --> 25:42.498
Pretty much.

25:42.499 --> 25:44.988
How do you feel?

25:44.989 --> 25:46.718
Younger.

25:59.139 --> 26:01.908
So what did you decide? About Tom?

26:05.279 --> 26:07.645
We're going to the school
tomorrow to discuss it.

26:10.246 --> 26:11.398
It should be fine.

26:14.049 --> 26:15.738
The truth is, I came over earlier.

26:15.739 --> 26:18.078
Got as far as the door.
I could hear you both.

26:18.079 --> 26:19.628
I thought I'd leave you to it.

26:27.499 --> 26:29.098
Anna, I know it seems strange.

26:29.099 --> 26:32.288
Normally with a break-up, you
throw everything of his away.

26:32.369 --> 26:34.428
Remove the tumour from the
body. That's what I've done.

26:34.429 --> 26:36.628
Scorched earth policy. Not
a trace of him remaining.

26:36.629 --> 26:38.188
It's not as simple as
that when you have a child.

26:38.189 --> 26:41.208
You never binned anything. You
were waiting for him to come back.

26:41.209 --> 26:43.708
- No, I never...
- I hate women sometimes.

26:45.009 --> 26:48.448
You could just never see
him. Even in the same town.

26:48.449 --> 26:50.928
You've got friends, a whole
life, even a new man now.

26:50.929 --> 26:52.568
But you...

26:52.569 --> 26:55.898
One minute, you want to destroy
him, the next, you're fucking him.

27:00.109 --> 27:02.380
Maybe you want to do both
those things at the same time.

27:04.881 --> 27:05.971
Dark.

27:08.129 --> 27:10.378
"Hate sex". I've heard it's good.

27:10.379 --> 27:12.488
Maybe I should give Neil a call.

27:14.369 --> 27:15.728
You don't hate Neil.

27:15.729 --> 27:17.278
I do.

27:19.529 --> 27:21.028
We're going to rent the house out.

27:21.029 --> 27:22.428
I'm going to live with my sister.

27:22.429 --> 27:25.008
And Neil's... I don't
care what he's doing.

27:25.009 --> 27:26.118
Your sister?

27:26.119 --> 27:28.648
She's in Edinburgh. Good
city for a new start.

27:28.649 --> 27:30.238
- In a few days.
- And you won't come back?

27:30.239 --> 27:31.318
Not if I can help it.

27:35.729 --> 27:40.178
It's been years. Are you sure?

27:40.179 --> 27:42.988
Maybe that's why I'm being
so honest with you tonight.

27:44.869 --> 27:46.978
Because I'll probably
never see you again.

27:49.929 --> 27:54.898
This is Simon's fault. He broke
up your marriage to isolate me.

27:57.249 --> 28:01.558
In your world, it really is
all about Simon, isn't it?

28:05.539 --> 28:06.708
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

28:06.709 --> 28:10.788
- Hi, Tom. Are you all right?
- Yeah.

28:12.859 --> 28:15.478
I was just saying, I'm moving away.

28:17.259 --> 28:19.368
You're... Why?

28:19.369 --> 28:21.148
I've split up with Neil.

28:21.149 --> 28:23.078
You've broken up too?

28:23.079 --> 28:27.718
Yeah. We... we can keep in touch.

28:34.789 --> 28:37.188
What happened with Max?

28:39.999 --> 28:41.448
I don't want to talk about it.

28:42.999 --> 28:44.078
Do you need anything?

28:44.079 --> 28:45.248
No.

28:55.459 --> 28:58.188
I always had the feeling that
you and Simon had amazing sex.

28:59.359 --> 29:02.968
- Yeah.
- Yeah. And I suppose you missed it.

29:02.969 --> 29:04.888
But the thing is, if you do this,

29:04.889 --> 29:06.908
hurt each other, fuck each other,

29:06.909 --> 29:10.888
every time it happens, you are
breaking your son a little bit more.

29:10.889 --> 29:12.248
You do realise that?

29:13.609 --> 29:14.918
Totally destroying him.

29:20.919 --> 29:21.998
It was a mistake.

29:25.709 --> 29:27.248
Yeah, and when it all goes wrong?

29:27.249 --> 29:30.248
This time, I won't be across the road.

29:40.569 --> 29:42.068
I've got to pack.

31:56.985 --> 31:58.064
See you later.

32:14.515 --> 32:15.874
Waiting to talk to Karen.

32:18.125 --> 32:19.444
I called you last night.

32:22.155 --> 32:25.014
Tired. Paperwork. Sorry.

32:25.015 --> 32:26.284
I would have come over.

32:30.175 --> 32:32.374
- You OK?
- Yeah. Fine.

32:33.645 --> 32:35.844
- You look a bit...
- What?

32:38.705 --> 32:41.894
Oh, nothing. I should go in.

32:41.895 --> 32:42.974
OK.

32:42.975 --> 32:45.174
See you tonight?

32:45.175 --> 32:46.534
I'll call you.

32:46.535 --> 32:47.614
Right. Speak then.

32:55.675 --> 32:58.534
Hi. Hi.

32:59.705 --> 33:01.394
It was an attack.

33:01.395 --> 33:04.164
Tom's saying it was Max
who was aggressive first.

33:04.165 --> 33:05.614
That's not our understanding.

33:06.885 --> 33:09.580
- Inevitably, this will have consequences.
- What do you mean, consequences?

33:10.185 --> 33:11.741
Permanent exclusion?

33:11.745 --> 33:15.874
- We're considering all the options.
- How's his work? His marks?

33:15.875 --> 33:17.054
Do you think that
should make a difference?

33:17.095 --> 33:18.834
He contributes to the life of the school

33:18.835 --> 33:20.384
the way you'd like every child to.

33:20.385 --> 33:22.584
- That's right.
- So why discriminate against him?

33:22.585 --> 33:24.224
I'm not discriminating against him.

33:24.225 --> 33:26.574
Because you've never
liked me, is the truth.

33:26.575 --> 33:29.334
Gemma, I would remind you, in
this situation you are a parent

33:29.335 --> 33:32.054
whose son has done something
wrong and I would appreciate it

33:32.055 --> 33:33.644
if you would show me some respect.

33:33.645 --> 33:35.474
Karen, you're doing a voice...

33:35.475 --> 33:37.354
I'm doing my job.

33:37.395 --> 33:38.894
I'm trying to find an appropriate

33:38.895 --> 33:40.964
and constructive
resolution for everyone.

33:40.965 --> 33:42.744
Of course, we understand that.

33:46.775 --> 33:48.717
Is everything all right at home?

33:48.718 --> 33:50.254
- Sorry?
- I have to ask.

33:50.525 --> 33:52.630
- You don't.
- In what respect?

33:52.631 --> 33:54.044
How is it relevant?

33:54.045 --> 33:55.774
In trying to understand the context.

33:55.775 --> 33:59.054
Max mentioned that you'd
visited him, asking about Tom.

33:59.055 --> 34:02.574
Yes, because I was worried.

34:02.575 --> 34:04.584
Then why didn't you
speak to him directly?

34:05.905 --> 34:07.634
Tom's living with me at the moment.

34:10.445 --> 34:13.494
Of course if, as you've suggested,
you were to make the choice

34:13.495 --> 34:16.494
to move Tom to a different school,
that might be a less disruptive...

34:16.495 --> 34:18.134
We haven't suggested that.

34:18.135 --> 34:20.293
- I assumed as per your email...
- What email?

34:20.295 --> 34:22.353
I thought Tom could move to St Austin's.

34:24.375 --> 34:25.964
Haven't you discussed this?

34:28.635 --> 34:31.214
Whatever was in that email last night,

34:31.215 --> 34:32.853
we've spoken since then

34:32.855 --> 34:35.674
and we're both clear that
this is where his friends are,

34:35.675 --> 34:37.824
and he's very keen to
stay at this school.

34:37.824 --> 34:40.024
- Simon sent the email this morning.
- What?

34:41.435 --> 34:44.103
This was a nasty, violent attack.

34:44.105 --> 34:47.484
Our policy is designed to protect
the child who's been the victim,

34:47.485 --> 34:50.574
and make sure that they can feel safe.

34:50.574 --> 34:53.293
And more than that, you don't
want Tom to get a reputation.

34:53.295 --> 34:54.984
Especially as you're a governor,

34:54.985 --> 34:58.074
so well respected in
the community yourself.

34:58.075 --> 35:02.434
It's in all of our interests to
draw a line under this quickly.

35:02.435 --> 35:05.574
- We understand. Thank you.
- Thanks.

35:11.955 --> 35:14.624
St Austin's is miles away.

35:14.625 --> 35:16.074
My side of town.

35:16.675 --> 35:19.061
You think they'd take him
when they heard about this?

35:19.062 --> 35:20.479
- We wouldn't tell them.
- We'd have to.

35:20.480 --> 35:21.780
I'm sure they'd take him anyway.

35:21.785 --> 35:23.728
- It isn't any good.
- It's fine.

35:23.729 --> 35:25.229
It's a private school.

35:25.265 --> 35:28.224
- So you'd pay?
- If I needed to.

35:30.235 --> 35:32.544
Why did you email her this morning?

35:32.545 --> 35:34.604
We had an agreement that
we would work together.

35:34.605 --> 35:36.054
St Austin's would suit him well.

35:36.055 --> 35:39.084
He can live with me, go
there, everyone's happy.

35:39.485 --> 35:41.544
- Well, nearly everyone.
- So you're putting yourself first?

35:41.545 --> 35:43.744
I'm putting Tom first.

35:43.745 --> 35:45.614
I'll tell Kate what we did last night.

35:46.935 --> 35:50.684
She won't believe you.
If only you'd filmed it.

35:50.685 --> 35:53.494

Yeah. See you in a bit.

37:41.365 --> 37:43.675

- You saw the video?

37:43.676 --> 37:44.874
Why did he have to come here?

37:44.875 --> 37:46.944
- We need to find him.
- Out of anywhere in the town.

37:46.945 --> 37:49.094
People are talking about
it. They know he's my son.

37:49.095 --> 37:52.334
- Where is he?
- We've just opened. It's the worst possible time.

37:52.335 --> 37:53.834
- Where is he?
- I've no idea.

37:53.835 --> 37:55.234
Has he gone to yours?

37:55.235 --> 37:58.664
Kate says no. I don't know where he is.

37:58.665 --> 38:01.194
At least now you can see
that Isobel was involved.

38:01.195 --> 38:02.694
She was right here when it happened!

38:02.695 --> 38:04.284
Perhaps she was just trying to help.

38:04.285 --> 38:06.864
- Have you looked at his photos?
- I told you, he deserves...

38:06.865 --> 38:11.604
He doesn't deserve anything. He's
lying to you. Look at the photos.

38:11.605 --> 38:13.854
I have to get back to this.

38:13.855 --> 38:15.444
You tell me if you hear from him.

38:52.195 --> 38:53.604
Shit.

38:57.115 --> 38:59.744
She's a doctor on call,
give her a couple of minutes.

38:59.745 --> 39:02.554
I was just saying you're a
doctor on official business.

39:02.555 --> 39:04.434
- Hi, Amber.
- Gemma!

39:04.435 --> 39:06.214
How's the little one? Three months now?

39:06.215 --> 39:08.834
He's four. He's happy,
he's always smiling.

39:08.875 --> 39:10.054
Sorry about this.

39:10.055 --> 39:13.664
Look, no worries. You stay
as long as you need to.

39:13.665 --> 39:16.664
- You're kind.
- No problem.

39:16.665 --> 39:18.914
So, where are we going, then?

39:18.915 --> 39:19.954
Fantons.

39:21.125 --> 39:22.204
Oh, great!

39:23.465 --> 39:26.044
Can I just say, I am SO nervous!

39:26.045 --> 39:28.854
I can't believe it's tomorrow!
It came round so quickly.

39:28.855 --> 39:31.014
I will need my hand holding
pretty much throughout.

39:31.015 --> 39:33.824
- No problem.
- Standing in front of people is not my thing,

39:33.825 --> 39:36.874
public displays of emotion, that
kind... what are you looking at?

39:36.875 --> 39:38.234
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

39:38.235 --> 39:39.774
- What?
- It's just...

39:39.775 --> 39:41.324
you go to the restaurant.

39:41.325 --> 39:42.734
I'll meet you there in a minute.

39:42.735 --> 39:45.214
There's just something
I've got to do. All right?

39:45.215 --> 39:46.624
Sure.

39:46.625 --> 39:48.684
Isobel?

39:50.285 --> 39:51.874
Isobel, stop!

39:51.875 --> 39:54.734
I heard what just happened.
Do you know where Tom is?

39:54.735 --> 39:57.034
- No, I don't.
- Well, why was he so angry?

39:57.035 --> 39:58.714
Can't you talk to him about it?

39:58.715 --> 39:59.794
I'm talking to you.

40:02.185 --> 40:04.154
He said that there was nothing going on,

40:04.155 --> 40:06.174
but I've seen photos of you kissing.

40:06.175 --> 40:07.764
Yeah. Yeah, we, we got off.

40:07.765 --> 40:11.654
- OK, so what... ?
- Tom's really messed up at the moment.

40:11.655 --> 40:13.996
Yes, so everyone keeps telling me.

40:13.997 --> 40:17.326
I need you to be specific
so that I can help him.

40:19.347 --> 40:20.466
What's going on?

40:22.677 --> 40:26.376
It was at the party.
We were in Tom's room.

40:26.377 --> 40:28.766
I kissed him. And he
said "Let's go outside".

40:28.767 --> 40:30.966
You know, get away from people.

40:30.967 --> 40:31.996
OK.

40:33.267 --> 40:37.066
Stuff happened, then
he went off, back home.

40:37.067 --> 40:38.746
What, what stuff happened?

40:42.827 --> 40:46.296
We were kissing, and it's OK.

40:47.657 --> 40:48.815
It's good.

40:49.016 --> 40:54.084
But... you know, I wanted to
do more and... then as we do,

40:54.247 --> 40:58.486
I had enough. I changed my
mind, I just didn't want to.

40:58.787 --> 41:01.906
But when I tried to
move, he wouldn't let me.

41:04.117 --> 41:07.206
He was, he was grabbing, he was,

41:07.207 --> 41:10.209
he got his hands on me really hard.

41:10.210 --> 41:11.516
He just wouldn't stop touching me.

41:11.517 --> 41:14.006
And I was hitting him
and I was pushing him away

41:14.007 --> 41:15.546
but he just wouldn't stop.

41:17.707 --> 41:19.396
Hey.

41:19.397 --> 41:22.116
Then I screamed at him,

41:22.117 --> 41:27.366
and he took a step back and
just, just started crying.

41:27.367 --> 41:30.556
And I ran and got away from
there as fast as I could.

41:30.557 --> 41:33.086
I didn't tell Mum, cos
nothing really happened.

41:34.447 --> 41:35.870
But when Max found out, he...

41:36.971 --> 41:39.896
he asked Tom about it
and Tom just hit him.

41:40.447 --> 41:43.066
And we were trying earlier to
sort it out, but he went mental.

41:43.067 --> 41:45.062
- You haven't told anyone?
- Just Max.

41:45.963 --> 41:49.050
I do like Tom, he's a mate.

41:49.127 --> 41:50.196
He's been through a lot.

41:50.197 --> 41:53.646
It doesn't matter what he's been
through, he should have stopped.

41:53.847 --> 41:56.006
- Yeah, I know but...
- It was wrong.

41:56.007 --> 41:57.696
- But I don't think he meant to do it.
- It doesn't matter.

41:57.697 --> 41:59.856
- He was drunk. Cos the thing is...
- It doesn't matter.

42:03.887 --> 42:05.756
I am so sorry.

42:09.647 --> 42:11.196
Isobel...

42:13.167 --> 42:15.646
... you tell your mum,
because she'd want to know.

He's through there.

43:49.217 --> 43:50.996
Why did he come to you?

43:50.997 --> 43:53.716
He knew what you'd think.

43:54.847 --> 43:58.966
I'd... understand.

43:58.967 --> 44:00.376
You'd be furious.

44:03.327 --> 44:08.486
How could he do it?
We've spoken about sex.

44:10.367 --> 44:11.436
I mean, he knows.

44:14.487 --> 44:16.126
Talk to him.

44:20.397 --> 44:22.506
He also said you've never understood

44:22.507 --> 44:24.756
how thin the walls are in your house.

44:27.427 --> 44:30.476
You mean he heard...

44:37.367 --> 44:38.486
Oh.

45:21.717 --> 45:23.066
I know about Isobel.

45:25.417 --> 45:26.636
Did Dad tell you?

45:27.997 --> 45:29.116
Dad knows?

45:31.137 --> 45:32.256
Yeah.

45:36.807 --> 45:39.056
Isobel.

45:45.377 --> 45:46.836
How could you do that?

45:49.137 --> 45:54.006
I mean OK, you were upset
and you were drunk, but...

45:54.007 --> 45:56.546
it's just not you.

46:12.487 --> 46:14.266
I'm sorry...

46:16.887 --> 46:20.076
... that you heard your
dad and me last night.

46:20.077 --> 46:21.196

46:30.347 --> 46:31.706
Are you all right?

46:31.707 --> 46:33.480
Tom?

46:33.481 --> 46:35.520
Your mum left me a message.
She didn't know where you were.

46:35.777 --> 46:37.706
Er, can you just give me a minute?

46:37.707 --> 46:41.316
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, just hang on a second. Tom?

46:41.317 --> 46:43.276
Tom, can you listen to your mum, please?

46:43.277 --> 46:45.716
I know you think you're
really popular at school,

46:45.717 --> 46:48.526
but that's only with the
year sevens, the 11-year-olds.

46:48.527 --> 46:49.936
- I beg your pardon?
- Tom, stop it.

46:49.937 --> 46:52.286
As everyone gets older, they
start to realise you're a dick.

46:54.297 --> 46:57.106
There's something Mum should
probably tell you. Isn't there?

46:57.107 --> 46:58.286
About Dad.

46:58.287 --> 46:59.376
Tom.

47:00.437 --> 47:02.036
They had sex again. Don't trust her.

47:55.417 --> 47:58.976
- Simon! Simon!
- Can you move out of the way?

47:58.977 --> 48:01.314
- Can you just wait for your dad?
- What are you doing? Let me in.

48:01.320 --> 48:03.896
- Can you just stand back there, please?
- Mate, stop. Step back.

48:03.897 --> 48:07.326
Step back. Kate's not happy
about you being around Amelie.

48:07.327 --> 48:09.996
- We're both not happy about it.
- You told her about Isobel?

48:09.997 --> 48:12.756
I didn't have much choice
after what you did at my work.

48:12.757 --> 48:14.626
My colleagues saw it,
as did many other people.

48:14.627 --> 48:16.606
Watch the clip. Look at yourself!

48:16.607 --> 48:18.526
You can't just do these things.

48:18.527 --> 48:20.682
Yes, he told me. It's disgusting.

48:20.683 --> 48:23.502
I know you wanted it kept a
secret but we're married, mate,

48:23.503 --> 48:25.702
- and we don't hide things from each other.
- What?!

48:25.703 --> 48:28.282
I'll help you, get things back on track,

48:28.283 --> 48:31.752
but for now, she thinks it's
better if you go back to your mum.

48:31.753 --> 48:34.282
- We both think it is.
- But you said this is my home now.

48:34.283 --> 48:36.952
And you told me about Mum, you
said it's OK because you're here.

48:38.833 --> 48:40.232
I know, but...

48:43.333 --> 48:45.722
If we can talk about this inside?

48:45.723 --> 48:49.142
- Calm things down a little.
- He's not coming in here.

48:52.003 --> 48:55.052
- You see, it's Amelie's home too...
- Oh, so she comes first?

48:55.053 --> 48:56.472
You made mistakes, mate.

48:59.523 --> 49:00.740
God, Tom!

49:01.241 --> 49:03.924
- You OK?
- He won't let me in.

49:04.013 --> 49:07.232
- I'm sure your dad's not saying that!
- I am. I'm sorry, that's it.

49:07.233 --> 49:08.699
- You're...
- What? I'm what?

49:11.100 --> 49:12.400
I'll drop your things round later.

49:13.993 --> 49:16.192
Tom, it's all right. We'll...

49:18.493 --> 49:20.642
You knew what he did. He told you?

49:21.813 --> 49:23.312
Yes, after we left you at the cafe.

49:23.313 --> 49:25.242
He made me promise not
to say anything to you.

49:25.243 --> 49:27.112
I tried to get you to
ask the right questions.

49:27.113 --> 49:29.132
He heard us last night.

49:32.923 --> 49:34.052
Heard what?

49:44.643 --> 49:46.382
He will never forgive you.

Maybe.

52:32.403 --> 52:34.322
And I am always going to look after you.

52:34.323 --> 52:37.792
And you don't have to do
anything, you don't have to smile,

52:37.793 --> 52:42.432
you don't have to love
me or return the favour.

52:42.433 --> 52:47.022
Because I am here, whatever. OK?

52:53.683 --> 52:55.042
I was so drunk.

52:57.523 --> 52:59.822
I don't really remember what happened.

52:59.823 --> 53:02.032
All I remember is her crying.

53:05.073 --> 53:08.682
I'm so, so sorry.

53:08.683 --> 53:12.392
I'm shit. It's shit.

53:17.033 --> 53:19.602
Maybe I should go, you know, leave.

53:20.873 --> 53:23.032
I don't want to, but it's probably best.

53:26.633 --> 53:27.902
Well, we could go together.

53:31.753 --> 53:33.902
You always said about your house,

53:33.903 --> 53:36.392
this town, your friends and your job.

53:36.393 --> 53:41.122
It doesn't matter. We'll
get in the car, we'll go.

53:42.393 --> 53:45.252
And we will sort everything out.

53:45.253 --> 53:47.692
OK?

53:50.783 --> 53:52.232
Do you trust me?

53:56.403 --> 53:58.472
Tom, you're going to have to trust me.

53:59.503 --> 54:00.952
Yeah.

54:08.453 --> 54:10.662
There's just one thing
I've got to do first.

55:28.193 --> 55:29.602
MOBILE TINKLES

55:35.273 --> 55:37.382
