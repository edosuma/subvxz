Tim Dunlear himself, head
of the foundation,

04:15.604 --> 04:18.540
former NBA star, notorious playboy.

04:18.607 --> 04:21.009
He was into drugs, gambling, women.

04:21.076 --> 04:22.410
My typical Wednesday.

04:22.478 --> 04:25.413
But then he left pro ball and
he turned his life around.

04:25.481 --> 04:28.149
He dedicated himself to philanthropy.

04:28.217 --> 04:29.417
He was beloved.

04:29.485 --> 04:32.420
Right, bad boy turned good.

04:32.488 --> 04:34.022
It's interesting.

Are you Emmett Toussaint?

04:36.759 --> 04:38.526
I'm Detective Decker. Can
you tell us what happened?

04:38.594 --> 04:41.963
I volunteer for the foundation's
outreach program.

04:42.031 --> 04:44.999
Came here to meet him, and
he was just lying here.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.434
How did you know Mr. Dunlear?

04:46.502 --> 04:49.304
He sponsored me to come to
L.A. after the earthquake in Haiti.

04:49.371 --> 04:50.872
Tim was my mentor.

04:50.940 --> 04:52.674
Handsome and saintly.

04:52.741 --> 04:54.181
Did you see anyone else at the scene

04:54.210 --> 04:55.376
or notice anything strange?

04:55.444 --> 04:57.378
There was a guy outside.

04:57.446 --> 04:59.113
He ran when he saw me.

04:59.181 --> 05:00.782
I gave the cops a description.

05:00.849 --> 05:02.150
Think he was homeless.

05:02.218 --> 05:06.254
Did Mr. Dunlear ever speak of
a certain philanthropic high

05:06.322 --> 05:07.956
after one of his selfless acts?

05:08.023 --> 05:09.290
You know, for example,

05:09.358 --> 05:11.826
say when he chose not to
sleep with a drunken woman?

05:11.894 --> 05:14.963
What?

05:15.030 --> 05:16.030
Did I say something wrong?

05:16.065 --> 05:18.933
We are questioning a minor.

05:20.202 --> 05:22.670
I'm sorry about your mentor.

05:22.738 --> 05:25.206
We'll call you if we have
any more questions.

05:27.910 --> 05:30.044
What? I just feel quite connected

05:30.112 --> 05:31.846
to our victim.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.282
You are nothing like Tim Dunlear.

05:34.350 --> 05:36.150
Bad boy with a heart of gold?

05:36.218 --> 05:37.685

05:37.753 --> 05:39.354
May as well be solving my own murder.

05:39.421 --> 05:41.356
Only you could turn a tragic death

you're gonna get away with this?

06:02.778 --> 06:04.646
Probably not.

06:04.713 --> 06:06.414

06:06.482 --> 06:09.417

06:13.922 --> 06:17.859
As much as I hate Lucifer, I'm
not gonna let you kill him.

06:17.926 --> 06:20.595
Oh, I'm not gonna do anything. No. Oh.

06:22.431 --> 06:24.165
But you know who would want him dead?

06:24.233 --> 06:26.301
Someone who's jealous.

06:26.368 --> 06:27.835
Someone who hates the fact

06:27.903 --> 06:30.905
that he's clearly got a
thing for his ex-wife.

06:32.041 --> 06:34.809
Ooh.

06:34.877 --> 06:38.880
Someone whose fingerprints I

06:55.264 --> 06:57.699
If they had just asked for help,

06:57.766 --> 06:59.000
he would have given them anything.

06:59.068 --> 07:02.103
What kind of person
would do something like this?

07:02.171 --> 07:03.638
Well, how much time do you have?

07:03.706 --> 07:06.841
Tim would be devastated to
know we've got to cancel

07:06.909 --> 07:07.809
the fund-raising gala.

07:07.876 --> 07:09.077
WOMAN: You're right, Kyle.

07:09.144 --> 07:11.646
Well, we wouldn't want to
devastate our fallen hero.

07:11.714 --> 07:13.448
The show must go on.

07:13.515 --> 07:14.715
This is an active crime scene.

07:14.750 --> 07:17.018
We can't have an event here.

07:17.086 --> 07:18.286

07:29.431 --> 07:33.101
and personally find...
and punish... his killer.

07:33.168 --> 07:36.371

07:52.254 --> 07:54.856
What is with you today?

07:54.923 --> 07:56.163
It was rather benevolent of me,

07:56.191 --> 07:57.925
offering up Lux, don't you think?

07:57.993 --> 07:59.360
Well, one good deed doesn't
make you a saint.

07:59.428 --> 08:01.829
Well, last I counted,
it was two good deeds.

08:01.897 --> 08:04.565
But, uh, I'm not
feeling the same rush as before.

08:04.633 --> 08:06.367
Perhaps I'm gonna have to up my game.

08:06.435 --> 08:09.103
Whatever you say, St. Lucifer.

08:09.171 --> 08:11.572
Oh, "St. Lucifer."

No, but I mean it's

cocaine and Molly with Pop Rocks?

08:48.371 --> 08:50.305
It's nothing like
that. I'm just curious.

08:50.373 --> 08:54.209
So you're feeling good about
not sleeping with Detective Decker.

08:54.277 --> 08:56.878
Well, yes, and offering
Lux to the Dunlear Foundation,

08:56.946 --> 08:59.247

vowing to find Tim's killer.

08:59.315 --> 09:01.983
You've identified
quite strongly with this man.

09:02.051 --> 09:04.252
Yes. Yes, a man of honor, principle.

09:04.320 --> 09:07.122
Hmm. You like the way being
good makes you feel.

09:07.190 --> 09:08.423
- Mm.
- But true good needs

09:08.491 --> 09:12.461
to come from a place of
selflessness, authenticity.

09:12.528 --> 09:13.729
Well, of course.

09:13.796 --> 09:16.498
I authentically want

09:16.566 --> 09:18.033
The Devil gets a terrible rap.

09:18.101 --> 09:21.937

Right.

09:29.011 --> 09:31.613
But goodness isn't a toy.

09:31.681 --> 09:34.449
Well, the way I'm
going to play with it, it is.

09:34.517 --> 09:37.219
(sighs)

09:37.286 --> 09:38.553
(chuckles)

09:38.621 --> 09:40.355
♪ ♪

09:40.423 --> 09:42.290
<i>MAN: I'm in between gigs.</i>

09:42.358 --> 09:45.627
I'm no thief, I'm an
actor, Louie DelGado.

09:45.695 --> 09:49.398
I had an arc on Party
of Five, look me up.

09:49.465 --> 09:52.167
I love L.A. Even the
homeless have an IMDb page.

09:52.235 --> 09:53.402
CHLOE: You care to explain why you were

09:53.469 --> 09:55.470
caught pawning Tim
Dunlear's championship ring?

09:55.538 --> 09:57.939
Listen, more importantly, why
did you take it to a pawnshop?

09:58.007 --> 09:59.741
The Dark Web has much better margins.

09:59.809 --> 10:01.062
I swear I didn't do nothing.

10:01.087 --> 10:02.234
CHLOE: Witnesses put you at the scene.

10:02.278 --> 10:04.146
You're telling me this
wasn't a robbery gone wrong?

10:04.213 --> 10:06.815
He was already dead, been
like that for a bit.

10:06.883 --> 10:08.617
Rigor mortis had set in.

10:08.684 --> 10:11.219
I also did a guest spot on CSI.

10:11.287 --> 10:12.087
Ah.

10:12.155 --> 10:14.089
Tim was my buddy,

10:14.157 --> 10:17.159
one of the few people who treated
me like a human being.

10:17.226 --> 10:19.127
Would your buddy have
approved of you stealing valuables

10:19.195 --> 10:21.163
from his cold dead corpse?

10:21.230 --> 10:22.898
Tim didn't care about stuff.

10:22.965 --> 10:25.600
Would have wanted me to have that ring.

10:25.668 --> 10:26.802
Give you the shirt off his back.

10:26.869 --> 10:27.803
What about his wallet?

10:27.870 --> 10:31.072
Uh, I was gonna return that.

10:32.708 --> 10:33.909
Some kind of key card.

10:33.976 --> 10:35.143
LOUIE: I have an alibi.

10:35.211 --> 10:36.311
I was at a shelter on 7th.

10:36.379 --> 10:38.113
Uh-huh. Keep an eye on Louie.

10:38.181 --> 10:40.582
I'm gonna see if his story checks out.

10:45.121 --> 10:47.756
I also know what it's
like to be without a home.

10:47.824 --> 10:49.191
My father kicked me out.

10:49.258 --> 10:51.226
It's very traumatic.

10:51.294 --> 10:55.263
But, much like Tim Dunlear, I'd
like to do whatever it takes

10:55.331 --> 10:58.233
to help you, so,
here, the shirt off my back.

10:58.301 --> 11:00.602
Yeah.

11:00.670 --> 11:02.137
And, uh, as you can see,

11:02.205 --> 11:04.773
the Devil does indeed wear Prada.

11:04.841 --> 11:07.008
Wow, thanks, brother.

11:07.076 --> 11:08.643
Yes, disastrous

11:08.711 --> 11:10.645
with those trousers, though.

11:10.713 --> 11:11.646
Oh, what the hell?

11:11.714 --> 11:13.348
As gratitude for telling us

11:13.416 --> 11:16.885
everything you know.

11:19.021 --> 11:21.156
And he's naked.

11:21.224 --> 11:22.390
Another act

11:22.458 --> 11:23.692
of selfless benevolence.

11:23.759 --> 11:24.693
It's quite liberating, actually.

11:24.760 --> 11:25.961
Oh, don't forget.

11:26.028 --> 11:27.429
Dry-clean only.

11:27.497 --> 11:28.563
His story checks out.

11:28.631 --> 11:29.698
We need to get a full written statement.

11:29.765 --> 11:31.199
And get our guy some lunch, okay?

11:31.267 --> 11:32.434
No-no gluten

11:32.502 --> 11:34.402
or-or dairy, okay?

11:35.905 --> 11:37.506
Another good deed

11:37.573 --> 11:39.374
but still no rush like before.

11:39.442 --> 11:40.675
Am I doing this wrong?

11:40.743 --> 11:42.444
In so many ways.

11:42.512 --> 11:43.879
Oh?

11:43.946 --> 11:46.214
You're not getting in my car like that.

11:49.085 --> 11:50.986
Meet you at mine?

11:54.991 --> 11:58.059
So, who do we suspect
of this grisly murder?

11:58.127 --> 12:00.462
Maybe Mr. Dunlear wasn't
as saintly as he appeared.

12:00.530 --> 12:03.765
Who knows who or
what he was involved with?

12:03.833 --> 12:06.201
He wasn't always such a good man.

12:06.269 --> 12:07.335
It's hard to shake your true nature.

12:07.403 --> 12:08.770
Well, not really. Look at me.

12:08.838 --> 12:10.472
Oh, no, I saw plenty.

12:10.540 --> 12:11.907
- Thank you.
- Cheeky.

12:11.974 --> 12:14.543
Oh, Lucifer, Detective.

12:14.610 --> 12:15.844
I wasn't expecting you.

12:15.912 --> 12:17.552
Yes, we have a few
more questions for you.

12:17.580 --> 12:20.248
Yes, how are you holding up?

12:20.316 --> 12:21.783
Doing my best.

12:21.851 --> 12:22.691
One moment at a time.

12:22.752 --> 12:23.952
Mrs. Dunlear,

12:24.020 --> 12:25.086
can you think of any personal reason

12:25.154 --> 12:26.955
why someone would
want to kill your husband?

12:27.023 --> 12:28.790
I thought this was a robbery.

12:28.858 --> 12:30.091
LUCIFER: No, turns out

12:30.159 --> 12:31.960
your husband was dead before
our homeless thespian

12:32.028 --> 12:33.929
pilfered his valuables.

12:33.996 --> 12:34.930
CHLOE: Did Tim have any enemies?

12:34.997 --> 12:36.598
Anyone that would want to hurt him?

12:36.666 --> 12:37.632
No, absolutely not.

12:37.700 --> 12:38.833
Everybody loved Tim.

12:38.901 --> 12:40.101
(knocks) Will Fleming...

12:40.169 --> 12:42.404
counsel for the
foundation and the Dunlears.

12:42.471 --> 12:43.672
CHLOE: This won't
take long, Mr. Fleming.

12:43.739 --> 12:45.240
Well, you're absolutely correct,

12:45.308 --> 12:46.575
because my client is done here.

12:46.642 --> 12:47.709
- Wha...?
- Oh.

12:47.777 --> 12:48.810
Actually I'm

12:48.878 --> 12:50.845
just here to talk to Vanessa

12:50.913 --> 12:52.280
about the gala... is that, uh,

12:52.348 --> 12:53.868
is that all right? Are you up to that?

12:53.916 --> 12:55.150
Yes, of course.

12:55.217 --> 12:56.251
Lovely.

12:58.087 --> 12:59.687
So I know it's not a good time, Vanessa.

12:59.722 --> 13:01.022
But I want to discuss...

13:01.090 --> 13:02.791
My client is grieving.

13:02.858 --> 13:04.159
You have any questions, you talk to me.

13:04.226 --> 13:05.527
All right, can you establish

13:05.595 --> 13:07.929
Vanessa's whereabouts
at the time of Tim's death?

13:07.997 --> 13:09.437
Are you accusing my client of murder?

13:09.465 --> 13:12.634
No, but one quarter of murders
are committed by family members.

13:12.702 --> 13:14.703
Yes, and half by acquaintances.

13:14.770 --> 13:16.171
Which gets to my next question.

13:16.238 --> 13:17.838
Where were you the night of Tim's death?

13:17.873 --> 13:19.473
Listen, you can look at me all you want.

13:19.508 --> 13:22.577
But Tim came into contact with
a lot of people around this place.

13:22.645 --> 13:24.279
Desperate people.

13:24.347 --> 13:27.716
Why do I get the feeling you
have someone specific in mind?

13:27.783 --> 13:29.918
Did you ever fight with Tim?

13:32.588 --> 13:34.723
Last night.

13:34.790 --> 13:36.891
You didn't tell me that earlier.

13:36.959 --> 13:38.360
I was ashamed.

13:38.427 --> 13:40.261
Tim told me I might not be receiving

13:40.329 --> 13:42.864
the scholarship money he promised.

13:42.932 --> 13:44.399
I got angry.

13:46.435 --> 13:49.037
Said some things.

13:49.105 --> 13:51.806
I was going to go apologize, but...

13:51.874 --> 13:54.175
when I got there...

13:54.243 --> 13:56.411
I'm gonna need to test
you for gunshot residue.

13:56.479 --> 13:58.613
And get a full written statement.

13:58.681 --> 14:01.049
Whatever you need.

14:02.918 --> 14:05.587
First, I want you to tell me more about

14:05.655 --> 14:06.855
Tim and his relationship

14:06.922 --> 14:09.057
with Vanessa... what was it like?

14:09.125 --> 14:10.959
Great...

14:11.027 --> 14:12.727
when the cameras were on.

14:12.795 --> 14:14.929
And when they were off?

14:16.866 --> 14:18.867
<i>LUCIFER: Ah, Detective, you made it.</i>

14:18.934 --> 14:20.802
A little underdressed, but okay.

14:20.870 --> 14:22.737
What happened with the orphan child?

14:22.805 --> 14:24.673
We're holding him, waiting
on ballistics.

14:24.740 --> 14:27.542
But he had a lot to say about
the Dunlears' perfect marriage.

14:27.610 --> 14:30.145
Apparently Tim hadn't slept
at home in months.

14:30.212 --> 14:31.680
Well, it's probably
all those good deeds.

14:31.747 --> 14:33.314
So time-consuming.

14:33.382 --> 14:35.116
Or... I was right.

14:35.184 --> 14:36.584
And Tim was back to his old ways.

14:36.652 --> 14:38.119
You know, that key
card we found in his wallet

14:38.187 --> 14:40.355
was from a hotel, so maybe
he was cheating on Vanessa,

14:40.423 --> 14:41.890
she found out,

14:41.957 --> 14:43.525
- then decided to...
- Punish the cheating bastard

14:43.592 --> 14:44.893
by pumping him full of lead.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.428
Well, that's option "A."

14:46.495 --> 14:48.196
Option "B" is the lawyer isn't
telling us everything he knows.

14:48.264 --> 14:49.431
Option "C" is

14:49.498 --> 14:51.433
an emotionally
distraught mistress did him in.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.868
Ah, that old chestnut... if
I can't have him, no one can.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.170
What did you get from Vanessa?

14:55.237 --> 14:56.438
- Is that why we're here?
- Yes, yes.

14:56.505 --> 14:57.572
She asked me to have lunch

14:57.640 --> 14:59.340
with the golden donors of the foundation

14:59.408 --> 15:00.742
on her behalf.

15:00.810 --> 15:01.943
It's the least I could do.

15:02.011 --> 15:03.278
Oh, the very least.

15:03.345 --> 15:05.714
What better way to get
intel on a murder than a gaggle

15:05.781 --> 15:07.182
of high-society frenemies?

15:07.249 --> 15:08.650
- Oh.
- Ah!

15:08.718 --> 15:10.318
<i>WOMAN: Tim Dunlear</i>

15:10.386 --> 15:11.853
was a true humanitarian.

15:11.921 --> 15:13.888
Oh, there's so few of us around.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.756
And I have no one to
help me process my grief.

15:15.791 --> 15:17.559
Can you believe my
therapist had the nerve

15:17.626 --> 15:18.626
to go on maternity leave?

15:18.661 --> 15:20.762
Oh, well, I'm here for you, Gayle.

15:20.830 --> 15:22.964
You can tell me anything.

15:23.032 --> 15:24.599
Oh.

15:24.667 --> 15:25.734
Oh, ooh...

15:25.801 --> 15:29.637
You are a good man.

15:29.705 --> 15:31.239
Yeah, not quite the reaction

15:31.307 --> 15:34.342
I was looking for, but,
uh, when in Rome.

15:34.410 --> 15:35.477
To Tim Dunlear.

15:35.544 --> 15:37.078
We all loved him.

15:37.146 --> 15:39.881
Mm-hmm, some more than others.

15:39.949 --> 15:41.616
So you heard about Donna Gray?

15:41.684 --> 15:43.451
- Oh, yeah.
- So sad.

15:43.519 --> 15:45.887
Throwing yourself at a
married man like that.

15:45.955 --> 15:47.689
Mm, and when they
started sleeping together,

15:47.757 --> 15:49.724
poor Vanessa.

15:49.792 --> 15:51.793
Tim turned Donna down cold.

15:51.861 --> 15:53.628
Not that it's any

15:53.696 --> 15:55.096
of your business.

15:55.164 --> 15:56.498
Oh.

15:59.135 --> 16:00.535
Tight-lipped and angry.

16:00.603 --> 16:02.137
Yes, well, with all that Botox,

16:02.204 --> 16:04.539
I'm surprised she can chew at all.

16:04.607 --> 16:07.008
This is taking too long...
maybe we should do your hypnotism,

16:07.076 --> 16:09.027
eye-voodoo thing to get them talking.

16:09.052 --> 16:09.701
Yes.

16:09.745 --> 16:12.013
You would expect that sort of
behavior from me, wouldn't you?

16:12.081 --> 16:14.149
Yeah, you making a
spectacle to help out a case.

16:14.216 --> 16:15.550
Yeah, it's what you do.

16:15.618 --> 16:17.552
Don't worry, Detective.
There'll be a spectacle.

16:17.620 --> 16:19.187
These women

16:19.255 --> 16:21.689
are lonely and unappreciated.

16:21.757 --> 16:24.292
If I give them what they
want, they'll give us what we want.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.661
Hello, ladies.

16:26.729 --> 16:30.064
Thank you all so much for coming today.

16:30.132 --> 16:32.167
Uh, you've all given so
generously over the years

16:32.234 --> 16:34.335
to the Dunlear Foundation.

16:34.403 --> 16:36.437
In honor of our fallen hero,

16:36.505 --> 16:38.072
I now give you a gift

17:50.443 --> 17:52.666
I loved him.

17:53.059 --> 17:55.599
Kyle, Tim Dunlear was
a hero to all of us.

17:55.627 --> 17:56.594
No, no.

17:56.662 --> 17:58.796
You don't understand.

18:00.232 --> 18:02.867
Tim and I were in love.

18:02.935 --> 18:04.569
- Oh.
- Oh.

18:04.636 --> 18:06.204
Right,

18:06.271 --> 18:08.673
<i>so Tim was cheating on
his wife with a man.</i>

18:08.740 --> 18:10.274
I did not see that coming.

18:10.342 --> 18:12.443
The Devil usually has impeccable gaydar.

18:12.511 --> 18:15.012
Tim was, uh, in denial

18:15.080 --> 18:17.215
about his sexuality for years.

18:17.282 --> 18:20.451
And then, um...

18:20.519 --> 18:22.153
we met.

18:22.221 --> 18:24.255
Hmm, that explains
why he was never at home

18:24.323 --> 18:25.756
and all the secrecy.

18:25.824 --> 18:27.625
Did you two ever meet at a hotel?

18:27.693 --> 18:29.060
No.

18:29.128 --> 18:30.761
No, that-that would've been too public.

18:30.829 --> 18:33.898
Uh, we only ever met at my apartment.

18:33.966 --> 18:35.333
Huh. What about Vanessa?

18:35.400 --> 18:36.501
Did she know?

18:36.568 --> 18:38.169
They, um,

18:38.237 --> 18:39.604
you know, they-they had an arrangement.

18:39.671 --> 18:42.306
Tim wanted it kept secret.

18:42.374 --> 18:44.509
And Vanessa agreed.

18:44.576 --> 18:47.945
She needed the Tim Dunlear brand.

18:48.013 --> 18:49.947
Monogamy fails again.

18:50.015 --> 18:51.449
So, if Tim didn't want
out of the closet,

18:51.517 --> 18:54.152
were you aware of anyone
that would want to blackmail him?

18:54.219 --> 18:56.053
Or threaten to go to the press?

18:56.121 --> 18:57.221
No.

18:57.289 --> 18:58.256
Um...

18:59.458 --> 19:02.226
But Tim texted me this photo

19:02.294 --> 19:03.461
for safekeeping.

19:03.529 --> 19:05.730
I... I have no idea

19:05.797 --> 19:08.099
what it means.

19:08.167 --> 19:10.635
- Hmm.
- It's actually the last I ever

19:10.702 --> 19:12.770
heard from him before...

19:14.139 --> 19:15.840
(sighs)

19:15.908 --> 19:18.075
Do you want another song?

19:20.112 --> 19:23.414
If there's one thing I
know about kimchi fried rice,

19:23.482 --> 19:27.885
it's that heat really kicks
things up a notch.

19:27.953 --> 19:30.221
You almost died. You came back,

19:30.289 --> 19:32.169
and this is what you do
with your second chance?

19:35.794 --> 19:38.729
You know what happens when you die?

19:38.797 --> 19:40.932
I can't say I do.

19:40.999 --> 19:43.568
Well, if you've lived a life

19:43.635 --> 19:46.504
like I did, you go to Hell.

19:46.572 --> 19:47.805
Oh, yeah.

19:47.873 --> 19:50.942
In my case, it was
for a couple of seconds.

19:51.009 --> 19:54.378
Down there, though, it was years...

19:54.446 --> 19:56.080
and years.

19:56.148 --> 19:57.815
And there's a door just for you.

19:57.883 --> 20:00.051
And inside, Hell

20:00.118 --> 20:02.753
uses what you love against you.

20:02.821 --> 20:06.023
For me, I love life.

20:06.091 --> 20:09.093
Everything about
it. Got a hunger for it.

20:09.161 --> 20:11.462
So...

20:11.530 --> 20:13.631
they starved me.

20:13.699 --> 20:15.466
No food.

20:15.534 --> 20:17.268
No other people.

20:17.336 --> 20:18.603
No nothing.

20:18.670 --> 20:20.438
No TV. (chuckles)

20:20.505 --> 20:22.006
Malcolm?

20:22.074 --> 20:23.407
Hmm?

20:23.475 --> 20:24.875
You need help.

20:28.347 --> 20:30.781
(laughs)

20:32.517 --> 20:34.418
You always were a scrappy one.

20:34.486 --> 20:37.288
Ah.

20:37.356 --> 20:39.824
Yeah.

20:39.891 --> 20:42.526
I do need help.

20:42.594 --> 20:44.595
Never to go back.

20:44.663 --> 20:45.997
So I made a deal.

20:46.064 --> 20:47.832
And all I got to do

20:47.899 --> 20:50.434
is put a bullet in Lucifer.

20:50.502 --> 20:52.770
I pull the trigger.

20:52.838 --> 20:54.772
(clicks tongue)

20:54.840 --> 20:56.974
You take the fall.

20:58.710 --> 21:00.177
Huh?

21:01.580 --> 21:03.714
Huh? Huh?

21:11.857 --> 21:14.759
Five-second rule.

21:17.062 --> 21:18.329
(laughs)

21:23.602 --> 21:25.303
TIM: Teaching,

21:25.370 --> 21:27.104
building,

21:27.172 --> 21:28.673
creating.

21:28.740 --> 21:30.107
I'm Tim Dunlear.

21:30.175 --> 21:31.676
Together we can educate Haiti today

21:31.743 --> 21:34.011
for their better tomorrow.

21:36.782 --> 21:39.016
(knocking)

21:44.489 --> 21:46.424
Mr. Fleming?

21:46.491 --> 21:47.825
What are you doing here?

21:47.893 --> 21:49.327
I understand you've been asking

21:49.394 --> 21:51.195
some pretty invasive questions
at a luncheon.

21:51.263 --> 21:53.264
I have reason to
believe that your client

21:53.332 --> 21:56.033
knows more than she's letting
on about her husband's death.

21:56.101 --> 21:58.035
Vanessa Dunlear's entire
world has fallen apart.

21:58.103 --> 22:00.638
I mean, what kind of a
person targets a-a grieving woman?

22:00.706 --> 22:02.406
A very rich grieving woman

22:02.474 --> 22:04.175
who stands to
inherit her husband's estate.

22:04.242 --> 22:07.678
Every cent that Tim had goes
back into that foundation.

22:09.348 --> 22:10.614
Which you would know,

22:10.682 --> 22:12.883
because now that Tim's
gone, you took control.

22:12.951 --> 22:14.485
That's an interesting turn of events.

22:14.553 --> 22:16.654
You are messing with the
wrong people, Detective.

22:16.722 --> 22:18.522
Good people.

22:18.590 --> 22:19.724
Back off.

22:22.361 --> 22:24.362
♪ I want you... ♪

22:26.498 --> 22:27.832
(Lucifer exhales)

22:27.899 --> 22:30.434
You'd never know that Lux
was a den of iniquity, would you?

22:30.502 --> 22:33.304
Well, as long as you don't look
too closely at the floors.

22:33.372 --> 22:35.439
Will Fleming wants to scare me off?

22:35.507 --> 22:36.907
Bring it on.

22:36.975 --> 22:39.377
Question is, whether he's protecting
himself or Vanessa.

22:39.444 --> 22:42.046
Or maybe they're just good people.

22:42.114 --> 22:43.594
Because you're suddenly the authority?

22:43.615 --> 22:44.615
Give me a break.

22:44.683 --> 22:47.852
Detective, even if Vanessa is guilty,

22:47.919 --> 22:50.721
this is a woman who's
denied herself carbs since the '90s

22:50.822 --> 22:52.102
and stayed married to a gay man.

22:52.157 --> 22:54.091
If she doesn't want to talk, she won't.

22:54.159 --> 22:55.926
And as for their attorney,

22:55.994 --> 22:57.394
well, he certainly doesn't strike me

22:57.396 --> 22:58.929
as the confessional type. Okay.

22:58.997 --> 23:01.499
Maybe I can't get them
to talk, but you can.

23:01.566 --> 23:02.500
Come on.

23:02.567 --> 23:03.634
I've seen you do it dozens of times.

23:03.702 --> 23:04.635
No.

23:04.703 --> 23:06.437
Not here. Not tonight.

23:06.505 --> 23:07.772
Am I missing something?

23:07.839 --> 23:09.940
I feel like you're
protecting our main suspects.

23:10.008 --> 23:11.909
No, I'm just
thinking about the children.

23:11.977 --> 23:15.312
You want to push pause on
a murder investigation

23:15.380 --> 23:16.914
so you can have a party?

23:16.982 --> 23:18.315
Detective, I made a promise.

23:18.383 --> 23:20.551
The ladies, the-the foundation,

23:20.619 --> 23:22.820
the proud nation of Haiti...

23:22.888 --> 23:24.355
they're all depending on me

23:24.423 --> 23:25.556
tonight.

23:25.624 --> 23:27.391
Now, Tim Dunlear may be dead,

23:27.459 --> 23:28.659
but his legacy lives on,

23:28.727 --> 23:31.195
and right now he needs
to go change into his tux.

23:31.263 --> 23:34.131
It's about the greater good, Detective.

23:34.199 --> 23:37.034
The greater good would
be parking your ego

23:37.102 --> 23:39.703
and helping catch the bad guy.

23:39.771 --> 23:41.172
The old Lucifer would have known that.

23:41.239 --> 23:42.306
Wh...

23:42.374 --> 23:44.275
I miss him, by the way.

23:45.877 --> 23:47.812
At least he had my back.

23:47.879 --> 23:50.147
(exhales)

23:50.215 --> 23:52.116
Detective!

23:55.785 --> 23:59.910
(mellow jazz playing)

24:01.553 --> 24:02.781
(inhales)

24:02.928 --> 24:04.267
Oh...

24:04.637 --> 24:07.883
Glad someone's having a good night.

24:10.553 --> 24:12.054
What are you doing here?

24:12.122 --> 24:14.256
You've ruined my life.

24:14.324 --> 24:17.059
The least I could do is ruin your night.

24:17.127 --> 24:20.062
Enjoy your evening.

24:20.130 --> 24:21.396
How'd you even find me, Maze?

24:21.464 --> 24:23.899
Followed the sweet stench of failure.

24:23.967 --> 24:25.434
(laughs)

24:25.502 --> 24:27.462
Look, don't blame me for
your problems, all right?

24:27.504 --> 24:28.570
It's not my fault

24:28.638 --> 24:30.139
that you betrayed your boss.

24:30.206 --> 24:33.675
My problems are your problems.

24:33.743 --> 24:36.345
Which would be the only thing
that you and I have in common.

24:36.412 --> 24:37.780
And so you came here because...

24:40.083 --> 24:41.016
because you have

24:41.084 --> 24:42.217
nowhere else to go?

24:42.285 --> 24:44.353
Yes, I do.

24:44.420 --> 24:46.255
I have lots of places to go.

24:47.190 --> 24:48.490
Lots of places.

24:48.558 --> 24:51.160
And because you have no
one else to talk to, either.

24:51.227 --> 24:52.161
(chuckles)

24:52.228 --> 24:54.029
Says the angel sitting here

24:54.097 --> 24:56.298
eating a medium rare steak

24:56.366 --> 24:57.866
by himself.

25:07.310 --> 25:09.411
What?

25:09.479 --> 25:11.413
It's not like you
were going to drink it.

25:11.481 --> 25:12.414
You're so boring.

25:12.482 --> 25:14.183
I'm actually not boring.

25:14.250 --> 25:16.385
I'm pretty exciting.

25:20.323 --> 25:23.492
My definition of "excitement"

25:23.560 --> 25:25.093
is fun.

25:25.161 --> 25:26.862
Danger.

25:26.930 --> 25:28.297
Sex.

25:29.232 --> 25:30.532
Spontaneity.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.601
You are none of those things.

25:36.105 --> 25:37.039
Yes, I am.

25:37.106 --> 25:38.640
Give me one example.

25:42.478 --> 25:44.980
You know that story about
Lucifer and the goat?

25:45.048 --> 25:47.449
Yeah?

25:49.219 --> 25:50.719
No.

25:52.355 --> 25:53.088
That was you?

25:53.156 --> 25:54.389
That was me.

25:54.457 --> 25:55.524
A whisper here,

25:55.592 --> 25:58.827
a divine appearance there...

25:58.895 --> 26:00.729
Word got around.

26:00.797 --> 26:02.130
He hates the goat thing.

26:02.198 --> 26:03.198
I know!

26:03.266 --> 26:04.733
(laughing) He could never figure out

26:04.801 --> 26:06.201
where it came from.

26:06.269 --> 26:09.104
You know, I've waited a
thousand years to tell someone that.

26:09.172 --> 26:11.340
(chuckles)

26:16.212 --> 26:17.646
Leave the bottle.

26:22.112 --> 26:24.686
Thanks for this, Kyle. I
know it's your job on the line.

26:24.754 --> 26:25.787
Whatever it takes.

26:27.991 --> 26:29.224
I want to find who did this.

26:30.093 --> 26:31.660
Thank you.

26:33.463 --> 26:36.365
So this here, this last text from Tim...

26:36.432 --> 26:37.733
looks like it was from
Port-au-Prince.

26:37.800 --> 26:39.067
KYLE: Tim didn't tell me

26:39.135 --> 26:40.469
he was going there.

26:40.536 --> 26:41.937
It wasn't on his calendar.

26:43.773 --> 26:45.841
Could he have traveled under the radar?

26:47.710 --> 26:49.912
Sometimes he booked his own travel.

26:49.979 --> 26:51.179
He-he had some buddies

26:51.247 --> 26:52.314
who own private jets.

26:52.382 --> 26:53.715
Sometimes they would travel as a group.

26:53.783 --> 26:55.550
So if Tim stayed in a hotel there,

26:55.618 --> 26:57.058
maybe that's why he had the key card.

26:57.086 --> 26:58.086
Third-world technology.

26:58.154 --> 26:59.154
Maybe that's why

26:59.222 --> 27:01.256
we couldn't read the magnetic strip.

27:01.324 --> 27:03.425
We do charity work in Port-au-Prince.

27:03.493 --> 27:05.827
We raised money to buy
land to build a school.

27:05.895 --> 27:08.130
Maybe that's what the
text of the barren field was.

27:08.197 --> 27:09.597
That photo was from a few days ago.

27:09.632 --> 27:12.200
The school would be almost
finished by now.

27:13.603 --> 27:15.604
Unless it was never built.

27:16.706 --> 27:19.141
Unless the money the foundation raised

27:19.208 --> 27:21.610
went somewhere else.

27:23.513 --> 27:25.614
Or to someone else.

27:39.362 --> 27:41.763
(snorts) Really?

27:41.831 --> 27:43.999
That's your move?

27:44.067 --> 27:46.234
You were planning to seduce me?

27:46.302 --> 27:48.236
That is... truly desperate.

27:48.304 --> 27:50.138
I'm not here to seduce you, Will.

27:51.207 --> 27:52.708
But I do know what you desire.

27:54.444 --> 27:55.844
What is it you think I desire,

27:55.912 --> 27:57.546
Detective?

27:57.613 --> 27:58.680
To do good.

27:58.748 --> 28:00.382
To help people.

28:00.450 --> 28:02.384
I did some research into you, Will,

28:02.452 --> 28:03.785
and apparently, you don't charge

28:03.853 --> 28:06.121
for your services here
at the foundation.

28:06.189 --> 28:07.255
I make a nice living,

28:07.323 --> 28:08.690
thanks to my corporate work.

28:08.758 --> 28:10.459
Yeah, you protect your
clients like a bulldog,

28:10.526 --> 28:12.561
but underneath it all, you're
a big softie, aren't you?

28:12.628 --> 28:15.964
I don't need to take
money away from those kids.

28:16.032 --> 28:17.766
No.

28:17.834 --> 28:19.101
But Vanessa does.

28:19.168 --> 28:20.035
What the hell does that mean?

28:20.103 --> 28:21.303
I looked into a school

28:21.371 --> 28:22.604
that was supposed to be built

28:22.672 --> 28:24.272
with the foundation's
money in Port-au-Prince.

28:24.340 --> 28:26.274
(sighs)

28:26.342 --> 28:28.210
It doesn't exist.

28:29.112 --> 28:30.545
What?

28:30.613 --> 28:31.933
I think the money went elsewhere.

28:31.948 --> 28:34.449
After all, Vanessa had a
hell of an expensive lifestyle

28:34.517 --> 28:36.718
to keep up after her
husband left the NBA.

28:36.786 --> 28:38.186
That is ridiculous.

28:38.254 --> 28:41.490
Besides, non-profit financials
are a matter of public record.

28:41.557 --> 28:42.824
They are.

28:42.892 --> 28:44.626
But they're so
complicated, it would be pretty easy

28:44.694 --> 28:47.062
to hide a few outgoing wire transfers.

28:47.130 --> 28:48.997
Here. I think Tim Dunlear

28:49.065 --> 28:50.766
looked into these
financials and figured it out.

28:50.833 --> 28:53.201
So he flew to Pout Au
Prince to see for himself,

28:53.269 --> 28:54.336
and when he realized

28:54.404 --> 28:55.937
where the money went,

28:56.005 --> 28:57.706
he confronted Vanessa

28:57.774 --> 28:59.307
and she killed him.

29:00.176 --> 29:01.977
That is pure speculation.

29:02.045 --> 29:02.978
It is.

29:03.046 --> 29:04.479
So help me get proof.

29:04.547 --> 29:06.648
If Vanessa transferred money to herself,

29:06.716 --> 29:08.517
it'll show up in her personal
financial records,

29:08.584 --> 29:10.385
which you have access to.

29:10.453 --> 29:12.220
You want me to violate my client's trust

29:12.288 --> 29:13.488
based on a hunch?

29:13.556 --> 29:15.624
You took this job to make a difference.

29:15.691 --> 29:18.160
This foundation can still do good

29:18.227 --> 29:20.028
the way Tim wanted it to.

29:20.096 --> 29:21.596
If you help me.

Detective Malcolm Graham.

The infamous Malcolm.

30:45.828 --> 30:46.961
Thanks.

30:47.029 --> 30:48.496
I'm still going to kill you.

30:48.564 --> 30:49.831
Ah...

30:49.899 --> 30:51.866
I should also mention
that if you pull that trigger,

30:51.934 --> 30:54.469
it's a one-way ticket
to eternal damnation.

30:56.372 --> 30:58.406
Oh, I'm not going to Hell.

30:58.474 --> 30:59.641
Now or ever again.

30:59.709 --> 31:00.642
No?

31:00.710 --> 31:03.111
See, I made a deal with an angel.

31:03.179 --> 31:05.747
And I've got orders to take you out.

31:05.815 --> 31:07.749
Your ass for mine.

31:07.817 --> 31:09.317
(laughs)

31:10.820 --> 31:12.187
Sorry, it's...

31:12.254 --> 31:15.290
My holier-than-thou brother
has hired someone to kill me?

31:15.358 --> 31:17.492
Well, this really is Opposite
Day, isn't it?

31:19.428 --> 31:20.595
You know what, Malcolm?

31:22.231 --> 31:24.532
It's nighttime now.

31:24.600 --> 31:27.836
It's funny how things seem
so much clearer in the dark.

31:32.308 --> 31:33.575
Is that all you got?

31:35.378 --> 31:36.578
Interesting.

they see my nastier side.

31:40.049 --> 31:41.316
Huh.

31:41.384 --> 31:43.318
Well, most people
haven't been to Hell and back.

31:44.920 --> 31:46.488
Rumor says

31:46.555 --> 31:48.089
you're not immortal anymore.

31:50.459 --> 31:52.093
it's bye-bye, Devil.

31:52.161 --> 31:53.395
Of course.

31:53.462 --> 31:55.463
Right. And what do you get in return,

31:55.531 --> 31:56.498
Malcolm?

31:56.565 --> 31:58.199
Your brother doesn't kill me.

31:58.267 --> 32:01.169
I stay out of Hell, live out my life.

32:01.237 --> 32:02.737
I love life.

32:13.349 --> 32:15.183
Sorry. (laughs)

32:15.251 --> 32:18.520
And even if you do kill me...

32:18.587 --> 32:20.388
what happens when you do die?

32:20.456 --> 32:23.458
Because you will... eventually.

32:23.526 --> 32:25.260
You'll still go back to Hell, Malcolm.

32:25.327 --> 32:26.394
There's nothing

32:26.462 --> 32:29.297
that my brother can do to prevent that.

32:33.102 --> 32:34.169
What's that?

32:34.236 --> 32:35.637
This?

32:35.704 --> 32:37.906
This is my Pentecostal coin.

32:37.973 --> 32:42.310
It's a subway token for
the damned, if you will.

32:42.378 --> 32:46.314
I was going to use it to
get back to Hell eventually.

32:46.382 --> 32:49.851
I suppose you could use
it to get out of Hell, too.

32:51.320 --> 32:53.288
Could come in handy
for someone like you,

34:40.529 --> 34:41.862

34:41.931 --> 34:43.864

She always does.

35:09.358 --> 35:10.558
I loved him.

35:10.626 --> 35:11.993
And Tim loved me.

35:12.061 --> 35:13.828
Well, no, technically, he
loved your assistant, Kyle.

35:13.896 --> 35:17.699
(sighs) Yes, but I... I would never...

35:18.901 --> 35:20.034
Tim was a good man.

He was selfless...

35:21.437 --> 35:23.371
Yes.

35:23.439 --> 35:24.772
Yes, he was.

35:24.840 --> 35:27.775

asked for nothing in return,

35:27.843 --> 35:30.278
not even his own happiness.

how she embezzled
money from the foundation,

37:58.471 --> 38:01.173
and when Tim found out
about it, you killed him.

38:05.678 --> 38:06.745

proof of the embezzlement,

39:51.684 --> 39:55.654
Yes, well, I suppose that
could come in handy,

39:55.722 --> 39:58.123
especially since he
just tried to kill me.

39:58.191 --> 39:59.519

- Mm-hmm.

40:02.061 --> 40:03.261

40:03.329 --> 40:05.263
He hired a gunman.

40:05.331 --> 40:06.798
I mean, I talked the chap out of it,

40:06.866 --> 40:08.800

I mean, it's a long
story, but I survived,

40:11.838 --> 40:15.140

be said for my Armani.

assured, St. Lucifer's retired.

41:24.610 --> 41:25.944
Really?

41:26.012 --> 41:28.613
'Cause I just got a text
from Kyle saying that someone gave

41:28.681 --> 41:31.983
money to Emmett
Toussaint's scholarship fund,

41:32.051 --> 41:34.186
enough for a full ride.

41:34.253 --> 41:36.321
An anonymous donor.

41:36.389 --> 41:38.790
Well, good for Emmett.

41:38.858 --> 41:40.459
Glad it worked out.

41:40.526 --> 41:42.060
Mm-hmm.

41:42.128 --> 41:43.328
- Listen, Detective, I...
- I want...

41:43.396 --> 41:44.529
- Oh.
- Sorry.

41:44.597 --> 41:45.831
No, you.

41:48.634 --> 41:53.205
Um, I've been thinking a
lot about the other night,

41:53.272 --> 41:57.242
why I showed up drunk to your place,

41:57.310 --> 42:01.813
why you wouldn't sleep with me,

42:01.881 --> 42:04.349
and I think us,

42:04.417 --> 42:07.352
our thing,

42:07.420 --> 42:10.622
maybe it goes beyond just work.

42:10.690 --> 42:12.891
- Or sex.
- What sex?

42:12.959 --> 42:16.228
Congratulations, the first
woman to give the Devil blue balls.

42:16.295 --> 42:18.964
Anyhow,

42:19.031 --> 42:22.601
I, uh, I just...

42:25.304 --> 42:29.641
I can let my guard down with you.

42:29.709 --> 42:31.743
I don't do that with anyone else.

42:31.811 --> 42:34.679
You make me vulnerable.

42:34.747 --> 42:38.917
And... maybe that's okay.

42:42.221 --> 42:44.623
Detective...

42:46.926 --> 42:50.862
if it's any consolation to your pride...

42:50.930 --> 42:54.588
it appears you make me vulnerable, too.
