WEBVTT

01:06.125 --> 01:08.083
Sweet, merciful Andraste!

01:30.916 --> 01:32.750
Hira? Over here!

01:42.083 --> 01:44.666
Damn humans and their damn stilt legs.

01:45.541 --> 01:48.708
Are you really
cursing all humans right now?

01:50.958 --> 01:52.333
Just their legs.

01:53.375 --> 01:56.333
Well, in that case,
come on, let's find the others.

01:59.125 --> 02:00.375
-Qwydion!

02:00.458 --> 02:01.416
Hira!

02:12.583 --> 02:13.500
Thank the Maker!

02:13.583 --> 02:15.666
-Thought the dragon might've got you.
-Oh.

02:15.750 --> 02:20.000
After I freed it? No way.
They're not mindless murder machines.

02:31.458 --> 02:33.625
<i>If anything, I think we really bonded.</i>

02:36.416 --> 02:39.166
Okay, great. Where's Hira?

02:39.250 --> 02:41.666
We saw her
run through the hole we blasted.

02:41.750 --> 02:43.833
Looked like she was headed
for the safe house,

02:43.916 --> 02:45.333
but she was too far away to hear us.

02:50.041 --> 02:52.458
We should probably get moving too.
You know, before…

02:54.458 --> 02:57.458
Hey, that is
a completely unfair assumption.

02:57.541 --> 03:00.375
Maybe, but you know what they say.

03:00.458 --> 03:02.250
Better safe than eaten.

03:07.958 --> 03:11.666
Listen up! We have to contain the beast
until the Magisters can restrain it.

03:11.750 --> 03:13.166
Set a perimeter. We'll--

03:20.166 --> 03:21.000
Fall back!

03:36.416 --> 03:37.875
-What are you doing here?

03:37.958 --> 03:39.750
I told you to get that pedestal working!

03:39.833 --> 03:43.625
It's been destroyed. Without it, there's
no way I can get the beast under control.

03:46.291 --> 03:47.833
Where's Magister Ammosine?

03:50.500 --> 03:52.333
-This is my fault.

03:54.166 --> 03:56.416
I was so sure Miriam could see reason.

03:57.416 --> 03:58.791
That I wouldn't have to…

04:01.541 --> 04:02.583
But I was wrong.

04:03.583 --> 04:05.666
And once again, you paid the price.

04:07.541 --> 04:08.958
I'm sorry, Neb.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.625
"There can be no master without a slave,

04:13.250 --> 04:15.583
and no slave without a master."

04:35.375 --> 04:37.125
It's time to take back what's mine.

05:01.166 --> 05:04.291
Magister, Knight Commander Tassia sent me.

05:04.375 --> 05:06.958
You have to fix the artifact
before the dragon kills us all!

05:09.958 --> 05:12.458
Of course. I almost forgot the dragon.

05:32.375 --> 05:35.333
So many lives to bring one beast to heel.

06:11.875 --> 06:12.708
Yeah!

06:14.708 --> 06:15.875
How did he…

06:22.583 --> 06:24.416
Commander, where are you going?

06:25.541 --> 06:27.958
We have reports of wounded
from all quarters.

06:28.041 --> 06:29.250
We need you here.

06:32.625 --> 06:33.458
Let's go.

06:40.958 --> 06:43.083
Miriam? Is anyone here?

07:28.250 --> 07:30.000
Hira!

07:31.291 --> 07:34.041
It's not safe out here.
The Guard's still looking for us.

07:35.916 --> 07:38.333
Okay…

07:39.208 --> 07:40.083
Um…

07:43.416 --> 07:45.333
I was so worried they'd taken you.

07:49.625 --> 07:50.750
Is that the Circulum?

07:53.250 --> 07:55.208
It didn't seem safe to leave it here.

07:55.708 --> 07:59.833
That damn Magister did everything he could
to try and get this location from me,

07:59.916 --> 08:02.166
but I swear
I didn't breathe a word about it.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.291
But… you were leaving?

08:06.208 --> 08:07.875
If he doesn't know
where the safe house is,

08:07.958 --> 08:09.250
shouldn't you have stayed here?

08:09.333 --> 08:11.125
You're probably right.

08:11.208 --> 08:13.291
But I had to find you.

08:15.458 --> 08:17.291
You didn't need the Circulum to do that.

08:17.375 --> 08:22.750
Obviously, but I wanted to keep it safe.
It wasn't exactly well-hidden, Miri.

08:24.750 --> 08:27.625
All right, it's safe now.
So give it to me.

08:34.041 --> 08:35.083
You were stealing it.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.041
You were always going to steal it.

08:38.125 --> 08:40.625
That's… That's why
you changed the drop-off.

08:41.166 --> 08:43.000
-That's why Fairbanks trapped you.

08:43.750 --> 08:47.375
He knew you were the traitor,
and you killed him to cover it up!

08:47.458 --> 08:48.625
I didn't want to!

08:49.416 --> 08:50.375
I…

08:51.541 --> 08:52.375
I'm sorry.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.791
You betrayed us.

09:06.375 --> 09:07.791
It wasn't like that.

09:08.375 --> 09:10.333
Just give me a chance to explain.

09:16.791 --> 09:18.708
Tell me everything.

09:20.083 --> 09:23.083
You know what the Venatori did
to my family.

09:23.791 --> 09:27.541
After we escaped, I felt lost, helpless,

09:28.625 --> 09:30.750
until I heard about the Inquisition.

09:33.500 --> 09:36.083
<i>You can't imagine what it was like.</i>

09:36.166 --> 09:39.541
<i>People of every race and creed</i>
<i>coming together</i>

09:39.625 --> 09:41.666
<i>under the very Herald of Andraste,</i>

09:41.750 --> 09:45.708
<i>trying to save the world from a problem</i>
<i>everyone else wanted to ignore.</i>

09:46.208 --> 09:47.625
<i>It was perfect.</i>

09:48.208 --> 09:51.375
<i>And I was so sure</i>
<i>that once we fixed the breach,</i>

09:52.125 --> 09:53.583
<i>we'd fix everything else.</i>

09:55.083 --> 09:59.000
<i>I thought there was finally a force</i>
<i>strong enough and pure enough</i>

09:59.083 --> 10:01.041
<i>to wipe out the Venatori.</i>

10:01.916 --> 10:02.875
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

10:04.041 --> 10:07.291
<i>The Inquisition was never</i>
<i>going to stand up to Tevinter.</i>

10:07.916 --> 10:10.541
<i>They were too afraid of collateral damage.</i>

10:14.125 --> 10:15.708
<i>So I found someone braver.</i>

10:17.500 --> 10:18.541
The Crimson Knight.

10:20.583 --> 10:25.416
We're going to turn the Templars
against Tevinter, even the ones inside it.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.333
Burn everything to the ground
and salt the earth.

10:28.833 --> 10:30.958
But we needed the Circulum to do it.

10:35.375 --> 10:36.708
I had to volunteer.

10:38.041 --> 10:41.500
You have to understand.
We couldn't just take it.

10:41.583 --> 10:43.500
The Divine
might be able to trace it to us.

10:43.583 --> 10:45.000
We had to stay hidden.

10:45.083 --> 10:48.291
So I… arranged for it to be stolen.

10:48.875 --> 10:50.958
I offered Rezaren a deal.

10:52.166 --> 10:54.666
He moved the Circulum to the palace.

10:54.750 --> 10:57.791
We were supposed to be caught
in order to make the exchange.

10:57.875 --> 11:00.791
He needed it for some ritual,
but afterwards, he'd give it to me.

11:01.625 --> 11:04.875
We'd escape,
and he'd scuttle the investigation.

11:04.958 --> 11:07.458
And you trusted him, just like that?

11:07.541 --> 11:09.416
I trusted myself.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.333
I had…

11:11.291 --> 11:12.166
leverage.

11:12.250 --> 11:14.875
Oh, never mind then.
You hear that, Roland?

11:14.958 --> 11:16.291
She had leverage.

11:16.375 --> 11:18.583
Of course it'd be a square deal then.

11:19.083 --> 11:22.875
You asked a Magister of Tevinter
to betray his nation,

11:22.958 --> 11:24.625
give up a powerful artifact,

11:24.708 --> 11:27.333
and look completely incompetent
while he did it,

11:27.416 --> 11:28.458
and he said yes?

11:29.625 --> 11:31.708
You'll have to forgive me,

11:31.791 --> 11:34.291
but what the fuck
could you have offered him in return?

11:34.375 --> 11:35.333
Me.

11:36.750 --> 11:38.208
It was me, wasn't it?

11:40.791 --> 11:41.625
Wasn't it?!

11:43.333 --> 11:44.166
Yes.

11:47.916 --> 11:48.750
Maker.

11:49.416 --> 11:50.500
I'm so stupid.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.541
You didn't need me to get into the palace.

11:54.041 --> 11:57.000
You were gonna
sell me back to him all along.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.583
I was never going to let him keep you.

11:59.666 --> 12:02.250
Oh… how thoughtful of you.

12:02.833 --> 12:05.541
Miriam, I swear you would have escaped.

12:06.166 --> 12:09.375
There was some stupid ritual
he kept talking about, but afterward--

12:32.083 --> 12:34.250
Kill everyone but her.

12:41.625 --> 12:42.458
Stop.

12:44.750 --> 12:45.916
Rezaren, stop!

12:46.000 --> 12:47.125
I surrender!

12:50.666 --> 12:52.791
I surrender. Just let them live.

13:00.916 --> 13:02.041
Is she insane?

13:04.125 --> 13:05.000
Sh.

13:09.500 --> 13:10.375
Restrain her.

13:14.250 --> 13:15.083
Now,

13:16.458 --> 13:20.125
tell me why I should bargain
for what's already mine.

13:20.208 --> 13:22.375
You did it once before, didn't you?

13:23.333 --> 13:26.458
Let them go and I won't fight you. Ever.

13:27.541 --> 13:29.166
I'll even help

13:30.416 --> 13:31.666
resurrect my brother.

13:32.166 --> 13:33.000
You'll win.

13:34.583 --> 13:35.458
You'll win.

13:35.958 --> 13:39.125
Hey! We all know that's nugshit, right?

13:39.208 --> 13:40.458
She may not be my favorite,

13:40.541 --> 13:43.041
but we're not leaving Miriam
with that bastard.

13:43.791 --> 13:46.041
It's not the bastard I'm worried about.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.625
It's the bastard's dragon.

13:48.125 --> 13:51.416
It doesn't make sense.
High dragons are wild animals.

13:51.500 --> 13:52.875
They can't just be trained.

13:52.958 --> 13:55.041
There's no way
one would act like this unless…

13:56.291 --> 13:59.458
It's being controlled.
Guys, guys, ah, I know what we should do.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.541
So what do you say, brother?

14:07.500 --> 14:08.750
Will you let them go?

14:09.666 --> 14:10.541
I would.

14:11.625 --> 14:14.416
Except that you made that impossible.

14:15.041 --> 14:16.291
You bastard!

14:17.875 --> 14:22.458
You're the one that insisted you were
my slave instead of my sister, Miriam.

14:27.333 --> 14:31.375
Well, this is Tevinter.
Theft of a slave is a capital offense.

14:32.791 --> 14:35.833
So when they all die screaming,

14:35.916 --> 14:37.625
I want you to remember

14:38.625 --> 14:39.666
that their deaths

14:39.750 --> 14:43.416
-are all your fault.

14:52.916 --> 14:54.375
First things first.

14:56.083 --> 14:56.916
Neb.

15:17.791 --> 15:20.166
Okay, I think this could work.

15:20.250 --> 15:22.458
Just make sure
you wait for my signal and--

15:31.083 --> 15:32.041
What?

15:32.125 --> 15:36.625
This is the dumbest plan I've ever heard.
We're all gonna die here, so… let's go.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.500
About damn time.

16:08.416 --> 16:09.416
Come.

16:19.333 --> 16:23.458
Down to using my own personal grenade.
Blasted good-looking do-gooders.

16:34.458 --> 16:36.291
Such a magnificent creature.

16:37.041 --> 16:38.875
But still just flesh and blood.

16:58.458 --> 16:59.291
Now…

17:00.125 --> 17:01.250
open!

17:25.083 --> 17:26.541
Neb?

17:27.041 --> 17:27.916
Halt!

17:28.000 --> 17:29.625
-Huh?

17:30.500 --> 17:31.375
It's him!

17:32.041 --> 17:32.916
It has to be!

17:34.208 --> 17:36.833
Brother, it's so good to see you!

17:39.666 --> 17:40.500
Miriam.

17:45.166 --> 17:48.125
Spirit, if you truly are Neb,

17:48.916 --> 17:50.041
retrieve your body.

17:51.041 --> 17:52.000
Come back to me.

18:08.041 --> 18:10.166
-Neb, no!

18:10.250 --> 18:12.500
I'm sorry. I tried to save you.

18:12.583 --> 18:14.416
I'm sorry it wasn't enough, but…

18:15.916 --> 18:17.125
you can't come back.

18:18.375 --> 18:21.500
Not in that thing,
not to this life. Please.

18:22.916 --> 18:24.125
Don't worry, Miri.

18:25.041 --> 18:26.166
It's gonna be okay.

18:28.083 --> 18:28.916
I love you.

18:34.416 --> 18:35.500
No!

18:40.041 --> 18:41.791
-Now!

19:07.791 --> 19:08.875
Whoa!

19:11.666 --> 19:15.541
Well, I'll be a hairy nug.
I can't believe that actually worked.

19:16.125 --> 19:17.625
You can thank me later.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.000
Come on. We have to help Miriam.

19:21.083 --> 19:23.541
What? Hey, it was my plan!

19:39.708 --> 19:41.375
Selfish bitch!

19:42.041 --> 19:43.958
You and your ungrateful brother.

19:44.708 --> 19:45.875
You were mine!

19:50.000 --> 19:52.875
We were never yours.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.833
Miriam, come here, slowly.

20:12.791 --> 20:16.833
If that thing wants a fight,
I say we give it to her.

20:17.833 --> 20:19.833
No more death today.

20:21.583 --> 20:23.416
-Qwydion?

20:26.166 --> 20:28.750
That's the thing
everyone forgets about dragons.

20:29.250 --> 20:31.666
They aren't monsters, or gods.

20:32.583 --> 20:35.166
They're just alive, like us.

20:43.875 --> 20:46.708
And if I were chained in a basement
for a thousand years,

20:47.708 --> 20:48.708
all I'd want--

20:48.791 --> 20:50.416
Is to be free.

21:03.708 --> 21:06.791
You know that thing's
just gonna ravage the countryside, right?

21:06.875 --> 21:07.750
Mm.

21:16.875 --> 21:17.875
Rezaren is dead.

21:20.375 --> 21:21.791
I have the Circulum.

21:21.875 --> 21:22.916
It's over,

21:23.583 --> 21:24.833
if you want it to be.

21:26.125 --> 21:27.250
You were right, Hira.

21:27.750 --> 21:29.291
Tevinter is an evil place,

21:29.375 --> 21:32.208
and I know what it feels like

21:32.291 --> 21:34.750
for that hate and that fear
to infect you, but…

21:36.166 --> 21:37.166
you can't let it.

21:39.458 --> 21:43.291
Help me take the Circulum to what's left
of the Inquisition and we can try again,

21:44.166 --> 21:45.416
free from everything.

21:47.541 --> 21:52.666
I just need you to say
that I'm more important than this.

21:56.208 --> 21:57.375
I wish I could.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.833
Holy crap, we're alive!

22:15.916 --> 22:17.583
Ha! Wow.

22:17.666 --> 22:20.583
I am, uh,
usually not this lucky.

22:23.708 --> 22:26.833
Guess Hira ran out of time
before she could finish us off.

22:28.500 --> 22:31.125
Or she couldn't do it.

22:32.375 --> 22:34.083
Hira made her choice.

22:35.125 --> 22:35.958
So have I.

22:40.333 --> 22:45.166
Without a dragon, it will cost dozens,
hundreds of lives to power the Circulum.

22:45.875 --> 22:48.875
I have to destroy it
before it gets to the Crimson Knight.

22:49.500 --> 22:52.416
-You mean we have to destroy it.

22:55.083 --> 22:56.458
Well, I haven't been paid yet

22:56.541 --> 22:58.916
and that thing's gotta be worth
twice as much now.

22:59.000 --> 22:59.833
I'm in.

23:00.416 --> 23:01.708
Uh, me too.

23:03.750 --> 23:07.250
You don't have to come, Roland.
I… I won't hold it against you.

23:08.500 --> 23:10.041
That makes one of us.

23:10.125 --> 23:14.083
Besides, I'd miss the company,
and the view.

23:15.791 --> 23:16.833
Smooth talker.

23:17.333 --> 23:20.541
So where do we go now?

23:20.625 --> 23:23.666
-I mean, Hira could be anywhere.

23:30.958 --> 23:34.291
<i>True. But we don't</i>
<i>really need to find her.</i>

23:34.375 --> 23:37.625
<i>After all, we know where she's headed.</i>

23:46.375 --> 23:49.666
Commander, I have a message
from the Tevinter woman.

23:50.666 --> 23:55.333
She has the Circulum,
but is being pursued by enemy agents.

23:55.416 --> 23:57.958
She doesn't specify who.

23:58.041 --> 24:00.250
Their allegiance doesn't matter.

24:00.333 --> 24:01.958
Their objective is clear.

24:02.583 --> 24:05.041
They stand in the way
of our righteous crusade

24:05.125 --> 24:08.291
against the Imperium
and all it represents.

24:08.375 --> 24:09.875
Take whatever you need,

24:09.958 --> 24:13.416
kill these agents,
and bring me the Circulum.

24:13.500 --> 24:15.666
Yes, my commander.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.375
I will have my war.
