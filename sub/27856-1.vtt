01:36.862 --> 01:39.929
Oh,
there's my sweet boy!

01:39.931 --> 01:40.897
- Hey.
- Come on in.

01:40.899 --> 01:43.299
Oh, so good to see you.

01:43.301 --> 01:44.635
Yeah, you too.

01:44.637 --> 01:47.938
There's my guy!

01:47.940 --> 01:49.338
Yup. Oh, yeah.

01:49.340 --> 01:51.073
We were getting
worried about you.

01:51.075 --> 01:52.476
Oh, I remember those.

01:52.478 --> 01:53.777
Yeah.

01:53.779 --> 01:55.545
- How was your trip?
- It was good.

01:55.547 --> 01:57.046
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah, I'm starving.

01:57.048 --> 01:58.147
Oh, come sit down.
Come sit down.

01:58.149 --> 01:59.818
Here, you can have that chair.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.817
There he is.

02:01.819 --> 02:03.019
Look at my guy!

02:03.021 --> 02:04.388
Oh, hey!

02:05.690 --> 02:07.323
Thought this guy, right here,
was never gonna show up.

02:07.325 --> 02:08.291
Uh-huh.

02:11.130 --> 02:12.632
Oh, hey, Nanaw.

02:16.535 --> 02:19.835
She wanders
around a lot.

02:19.837 --> 02:22.471
Let me get that,
right there, real quick.

02:22.473 --> 02:25.374
Is there anything
interesting

02:25.376 --> 02:27.077
in the evening paper, son?

02:27.079 --> 02:28.011
What is it?

02:28.013 --> 02:30.314
Ah!

02:30.316 --> 02:31.614
Look at the
nosy parker over there

02:31.616 --> 02:33.049
wondering what we're up to.

02:33.051 --> 02:34.216
Oh, not a whole lot, Walt.

02:34.218 --> 02:35.685
Just slashing prices
on Ground Round.

02:35.687 --> 02:37.587
Mm-hmm.
- I'm gonna tell you,

02:37.589 --> 02:38.755
since the last time
you've been here,

02:38.757 --> 02:40.523
This guy right here...
...nuts.

02:40.525 --> 02:42.159
He's loosing it.

02:42.161 --> 02:43.793
- I don't know where the off switch is on this guy.
- Oh, hey.

02:43.795 --> 02:44.661
He's lost it.

02:44.663 --> 02:45.828
We need to get one
of those crazy jackets

02:45.830 --> 02:47.196
that tie up really
tight in the back.

02:47.198 --> 02:49.131
We should really do that to him.

02:52.137 --> 02:53.737
But seriously...
Seriously.

02:53.739 --> 02:54.771
We're, uh...

02:54.773 --> 02:56.707
We're getting real busy
down at the store.

02:56.709 --> 02:58.441
And, uh...
You know we could...

02:58.443 --> 03:00.476
We could really
use some help.

03:00.478 --> 03:02.144
Wonder who
we could find?

03:02.146 --> 03:03.949
Hmm.

03:04.650 --> 03:06.116
Well, I don't know...

03:06.118 --> 03:08.417
I really, sorta had my mind set
on working where my dad worked.

03:09.354 --> 03:11.188
Mm-hmm.
Oh, my...

03:13.525 --> 03:14.624
Switching gears
on us, Papa.

03:14.626 --> 03:16.827
Oh, no, no, Pennyfeathers.
Pennyfeathers.

03:16.829 --> 03:18.761
Walter, we understand.

03:18.763 --> 03:20.863
You'll be a heck of salesman
where ever you go.

03:20.865 --> 03:23.333
You know, your daddy
was a great salesman

03:23.335 --> 03:25.067
- back at the antique mall.
- Mm-hmm.

03:25.069 --> 03:26.769
Ice cream to Eskimos.

03:26.771 --> 03:29.339
Down there they say,
"He could do anything."

03:29.341 --> 03:31.475
Oh, that reminds me.

03:31.477 --> 03:34.077
All your daddies stuff
is in boxes up in that attic.

03:34.079 --> 03:36.546
Feel free to go through
anything you want up there.

03:36.548 --> 03:38.447
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.

03:38.449 --> 03:39.815
Oh, it just does
my heart good

03:39.817 --> 03:43.619
to see you following in your
daddy's footsteps like this.

03:43.621 --> 03:45.657
Let's dig in.

05:40.371 --> 05:42.105
Hi.

05:42.107 --> 05:44.609
I'm supposed to meet a man named Dewey Ray.

05:45.309 --> 05:46.812
Oh, yes.
Of course.

05:48.847 --> 05:49.849
Ooh. Uh.

05:51.516 --> 05:53.718
Hello? Hello?

05:54.486 --> 05:56.589
Oh... Hello?

05:57.556 --> 05:59.258
Did I tell you
about my ankle?

06:00.391 --> 06:01.758
- Keeps turning on it's self...
- Uh...

06:01.760 --> 06:03.626
...on account
of the rheumatoid.

06:03.628 --> 06:05.929
They want $20,000 for it.

06:05.931 --> 06:08.631
I mean, hell, all it is
is a block of wood

06:08.633 --> 06:10.867
with a hinge.
It's not the money...

06:10.869 --> 06:13.235
It's just... It's just
the principle of the thing.

06:13.237 --> 06:14.103
But I don't mind the money.

06:14.105 --> 06:15.638
I can afford to get
my titties done

06:15.640 --> 06:17.439
on account that one is...

06:17.441 --> 06:19.843
...is larger
than the other one.

06:19.845 --> 06:22.011
Oh.

06:22.013 --> 06:23.246
Yes.

06:23.248 --> 06:25.448
I know you.
Pill time.

06:25.450 --> 06:26.319
Here we go.

06:27.852 --> 06:30.186
If I... If I
don't set a timer,

06:30.188 --> 06:31.487
then I don't remember.

06:31.489 --> 06:33.889
And if I don't remember,
well, I won't die...

06:33.891 --> 06:37.193
But, it won't be
good for nobody.

06:37.195 --> 06:38.698
Hmm... Hmm.

06:47.806 --> 06:49.739
What was I doing?

06:49.741 --> 06:51.574
You were about to tell me
where Dewey Ray's office is.

06:51.576 --> 06:52.641
Oh, yes.

06:52.643 --> 06:53.843
But, seriously...

06:53.845 --> 06:55.477
Do you think I should
get my titties done?

06:55.479 --> 06:58.581
- Yeah, I... Hmm. Don't... don't, uh...
- Look at how they rest.

06:58.583 --> 07:00.150
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

07:00.152 --> 07:01.217
You're not looking.

07:01.219 --> 07:03.252
Yeah, I... I, uh...

07:03.254 --> 07:04.821
I'm gonna ask this guy.

07:04.823 --> 07:06.792
- Thank... Thank you, though.
- Uh...

07:07.325 --> 07:08.891
Maybe I should just...

07:08.893 --> 07:10.729
Just a little off the nose.

07:12.097 --> 07:14.064
- What's that?
- It's a package.

07:14.066 --> 07:16.232
I know what it is, Stonehenge.
What's in it?

07:16.234 --> 07:18.268
Just sign it, please?

07:18.270 --> 07:20.136
What do you eat for breakfast?
Boiled eggs?

07:20.138 --> 07:24.277
I bet you eat sawdust and
shit logs, don't you, boy?

07:25.376 --> 07:26.978
You suntanning
your underwear?

07:27.746 --> 07:29.414
I'm gonna keep this.

07:33.751 --> 07:37.920
Mama, I don't know about
this place sometimes.

07:37.922 --> 07:40.091
It's times like this,
I wish you were still here.

07:44.095 --> 07:46.197
Honey, you're
mama's on line one.

07:49.167 --> 07:50.533
Hey, Mama.

07:50.535 --> 07:52.938
No, it's just sometimes
I don't know about this place.

07:54.039 --> 07:56.208
No, I just don't
think you trust me.

07:57.609 --> 07:59.311
So, it's because
you don't trust me.

08:01.379 --> 08:03.612
Why would your pills
be under the bubble wrap, Ma?

08:03.614 --> 08:04.881
I don't see 'em.

08:04.883 --> 08:07.083
Are you on
your clonipine again?

08:07.085 --> 08:09.218
And you're wearing
a nicotine patch?

08:09.220 --> 08:10.453
Okay, I got to go.

08:10.455 --> 08:12.091
I got to go.
I got to go.

08:13.458 --> 08:14.723
What can I do for you?

08:14.725 --> 08:16.559
Uh, I am looking
for a Dewey Ray.

08:16.561 --> 08:18.961
Do me a favor.
Don't ever...

08:18.963 --> 08:21.665
Touch my figurines
again, please.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.133
- I'm sorry. Mm-hmm.
- All right?

08:23.135 --> 08:26.468
That right there is Brigadier General M.
Jeff Thompson.

08:26.470 --> 08:28.371
Swamp Fox
of the Confederacy?

08:28.373 --> 08:32.409
Probably the most irascible
man of the entire Civil War.

08:32.410 --> 08:34.711
And I'm restaging the
Battle of Fredericktown.

08:34.712 --> 08:37.679
Do you even care about
the Battle of Fredericktown?

08:37.682 --> 08:39.951
- Uh...
- These were my daddy's things.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.484
He used to whoop me.

08:42.486 --> 08:43.719
He'd put his foot

08:43.721 --> 08:44.721
right about there
on my neck

08:44.723 --> 08:46.225
and hit me with a shovel.

08:47.725 --> 08:49.128
He was a good man.

08:50.494 --> 08:52.261
Sounds...

08:52.263 --> 08:53.596
...complicated.

08:53.598 --> 08:56.232
Probably his most
prized possession.

08:56.234 --> 08:57.666
Arkansas toothpick

08:57.668 --> 09:00.402
used by Jeb "Golden
Spurs" Newton himself

09:00.404 --> 09:02.237
at the Battle of Stench Creek.

09:02.239 --> 09:04.873
It's a bond between
a boy and his daddy.

09:04.875 --> 09:07.045
It was forged
by the James Blight.

09:08.213 --> 09:11.014
A white-hot fiery conflict
much like or love.

09:11.016 --> 09:13.683
Sometimes I'm wearing shorts
and that's too heavy.

09:13.685 --> 09:14.950
So I carry this.

09:14.952 --> 09:16.419
That's a nickle he gave me.

09:16.421 --> 09:17.886
Also very important.

09:17.888 --> 09:20.258
And also forged in heat.

09:21.225 --> 09:23.559
So these are all battles
that the South won.

09:23.561 --> 09:26.029
The South won all these.
That's right.

09:26.031 --> 09:27.564
You get a lot of customers

09:27.566 --> 09:29.368
for that sort of
thing around here?

09:30.768 --> 09:32.238
Connoisseurs.

09:33.537 --> 09:35.472
But mostly,
I sell candy bars.

09:35.474 --> 09:38.107
Boys, we have
a store meeting after lunch.

09:38.109 --> 09:39.442
Big announcement to make.

09:39.444 --> 09:40.343
What are you gonna do?

09:40.345 --> 09:42.212
Let everybody know
you take it up the seat?

09:42.214 --> 09:44.012
Your mama takes it
up the seat.

09:44.014 --> 09:45.681
And I mean literally.

09:45.683 --> 09:50.252
Bent over that 66 inch L-shaped
laminate desktop just the other day.

09:50.254 --> 09:53.455
Did I tell you I'm married
to Blundale's mama.

09:53.457 --> 09:55.026
No, sir. We haven't met.

09:55.893 --> 09:57.059
Are you Dewey Ray?

09:57.061 --> 09:58.261
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm Walt Prior.

09:58.263 --> 09:59.929
I believe we spoke
on the phone.

09:59.931 --> 10:01.798
Dennis Prior's boy.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.299
Look at you.

10:03.301 --> 10:05.834
Now that you mention it,
you're the splitting image.

10:05.836 --> 10:07.237
- You're Dennis' boy?
- Yup.

10:07.239 --> 10:09.805
Ooh, your dad and I
had some good times.

10:09.807 --> 10:11.741
We worked here together
during school.

10:11.743 --> 10:14.979
This is where I actually
met Blundale's mama.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.381
Yeah, I was a
18-year-old senior,

10:19.383 --> 10:20.683
muscles out to here.

10:20.685 --> 10:23.419
Getting more tang
than Buzz Aldrin.

10:23.421 --> 10:26.588
And she was a
experienced woman, boy.

10:26.590 --> 10:27.623
She ran hot.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.793
- Face get all red during sex.
- Okay.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.059
Thanks, Dewey.

10:31.061 --> 10:32.428
Speaking of running hot.

10:32.430 --> 10:35.497
Did you get that timing belt
fixed on your truck, son?

10:35.499 --> 10:36.799
I'm not his son.

10:36.801 --> 10:38.767
We went to school together.
Same time.

10:38.769 --> 10:40.402
Yeah, been like
a father to him,

10:40.404 --> 10:42.874
at least since so far all
the sex I had with his mama.

10:43.675 --> 10:45.641
Hey, Walter, first job.

10:45.643 --> 10:46.943
Can you help
Jimmy Lee over there

10:46.945 --> 10:49.344
put that Mrs Claus
oh his tree?

10:49.346 --> 10:50.280
I'm sorry. Am I hired?

10:50.282 --> 10:52.048
I don't give a shit.
Do you want to be hired.

10:52.050 --> 10:54.284
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, first job.

10:54.286 --> 10:56.251
Make sure Jimmy Lee
don't fall.

10:56.253 --> 10:57.523
Kill himself.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.558
Hey, let me help you here.

11:01.560 --> 11:04.563
Oh. Aren't you a dear.

11:05.629 --> 11:07.997
Honey, you didn't
have to do that.

11:07.999 --> 11:09.464
- There you go.
- Looks perfect.

11:09.466 --> 11:10.699
Uh, I'm Walt.

11:10.701 --> 11:12.168
James Lee Williams.

11:12.170 --> 11:14.136
But you can call me
Jimmy Lee.

11:14.138 --> 11:16.139
- Okay.
- Have a seat.

11:16.141 --> 11:18.607
- Come on in. Let's talk.
- Okay.

11:18.609 --> 11:20.977
It's my little living room.

11:23.114 --> 11:24.917
Oh, yeah.

11:30.721 --> 11:31.854
I like your shoes, Jimmy Lee.

11:31.856 --> 11:34.857
Oh. They're alligator shoes.

11:34.859 --> 11:36.693
<i>♪ Alligator shoes ♪</i>

11:36.695 --> 11:38.194
<i>♪ Alligator shoes ♪</i>

11:38.196 --> 11:41.964
<i>♪ If I don't get some
I'm gonna get the blues ♪</i>

11:41.966 --> 11:44.135
Do you know that song?

11:44.835 --> 11:46.602
Yeah. May... Maybe.

11:46.604 --> 11:48.771
- Are you new here?
- Yes.

11:48.773 --> 11:50.540
I just came in
from Little Rock.

11:50.542 --> 11:53.742
Oh. Well, I'm sorry.

11:55.146 --> 11:57.045
I'd just as soon pitch a
golf ball at a monkey's butt

11:57.047 --> 12:00.049
as go to Little Rock
but it makes sense

12:00.051 --> 12:04.319
because you have
a very innocent style.

12:04.321 --> 12:07.189
I bet the girls go for you, don't they?

12:07.191 --> 12:09.458
- Uh...
- I bet they do.

12:10.494 --> 12:12.862
I bet they do.

12:12.864 --> 12:17.570
Hmm. Um, did you happen to
know my dad, Dennis Prior?

12:19.738 --> 12:22.738
As I live and breath.
You...

12:22.740 --> 12:24.240
Dennis was your daddy?

12:24.242 --> 12:27.043
- Yeah. Yeah, he was.
- Oh, heavens to Betsy.

12:27.045 --> 12:30.045
Everybody's got
a story about Dennis.

12:30.047 --> 12:32.214
You know who you should
talk to first, though,

12:32.216 --> 12:33.815
is old Coach McGee.

12:33.817 --> 12:35.218
He has the booth
back there

12:35.220 --> 12:36.386
with the baseball cards,

12:36.388 --> 12:39.021
He was your
daddy's boxing coach.

12:39.023 --> 12:40.957
- Hey, new guy?
- Hmm.

12:40.959 --> 12:42.592
Can I talk to you
a second?

12:42.594 --> 12:45.295
Yeah. Uh, nice to meet you.

12:45.297 --> 12:47.229
Nice to meet you, Walter.

12:47.231 --> 12:48.333
Hey there, Delaney.

12:49.700 --> 12:52.734
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna be the princess.

12:52.736 --> 12:55.972
Yes, 'cause you're gonna be a princess.

12:57.142 --> 12:58.641
I just wanted to get
you away from him.

12:58.643 --> 13:00.175
That guy freaks me out.

13:00.177 --> 13:02.145
Oh, I think
he's pretty harmless.

13:02.147 --> 13:04.814
Yeah. Until he starts
making up songs about you.

13:04.816 --> 13:07.418
You stick with Blundale and me,
you should be all right.

13:08.253 --> 13:10.053
Want to go to lunch
with us later?

13:10.055 --> 13:12.391
Uh, yeah. Sure.

13:21.999 --> 13:24.467
Oh, it's just a protein shake.

13:24.469 --> 13:26.135
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- It's organic.

13:26.137 --> 13:28.871
I've been doing the Navy Seal
workout the last couple of years.

13:28.873 --> 13:30.743
My brother's a Navy Seal.

13:31.609 --> 13:32.574
I don't talk about him much.

13:32.576 --> 13:34.679
Secret missions
and all that but...

13:35.680 --> 13:37.181
I trained with him, though.

13:38.282 --> 13:40.650
How do you train
with the Navy Seals

13:40.652 --> 13:43.122
if you're not a Navy Seal?

13:50.662 --> 13:51.694
Who is that?

13:51.696 --> 13:53.563
- Who, Ellie?
- She works here?

13:53.565 --> 13:55.264
Yeah, she's got
a pottery booth upstairs.

13:55.266 --> 13:56.466
She went around
the world or something.

13:56.468 --> 13:57.934
Half of Europe and one
of the other ones.

13:57.936 --> 13:58.934
And she's from here?

13:58.936 --> 14:00.102
Born and raised.

14:00.104 --> 14:01.603
I hear she went for
some sort of treatment too,

14:01.605 --> 14:03.973
but you didn't hear that from me.
Hey, Ellie.

14:03.975 --> 14:05.540
Hey, Delaney.

14:05.542 --> 14:06.943
You're looking good.

14:06.945 --> 14:08.243
Oh, yeah?

14:08.245 --> 14:12.518
Well, I lost like 20 pounds
while you were away.

14:13.752 --> 14:15.154
No you didn't.

14:24.829 --> 14:25.828
Hey.

14:25.830 --> 14:27.030
Hi.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.830
I'm Walt Prior.

14:28.832 --> 14:30.165
I'm new.

14:30.167 --> 14:31.601
Did you touch my stuff
while I was gone?

14:31.603 --> 14:32.935
Did I what?

14:32.937 --> 14:36.439
Because the treatment that he
mentioned was for rage issues.

14:36.441 --> 14:39.041
And if you touched my
stuff while I was gone,

14:39.043 --> 14:41.209
I will stomp a mud hole...

14:41.211 --> 14:43.913
No, I just started.
I promise I did not touch...

14:43.915 --> 14:44.847
...anything.

14:44.849 --> 14:46.348
I don't even know...

14:46.350 --> 14:47.683
what stuff is yours.

14:47.685 --> 14:48.787
So...

14:51.455 --> 14:54.457
Oh, your face. I'm just kidding.
Relax.

14:54.459 --> 14:57.126
Oh, wow. I was...

14:57.128 --> 14:58.461
I was really
intimidating, wasn't I?

14:58.463 --> 15:00.262
Yeah. Yeah.

15:00.264 --> 15:02.598
I was never in treatment
by the way.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.536
It's nice to know what
the rumors are though.

15:05.202 --> 15:07.238
One thing that
is not a rumor,

15:08.105 --> 15:09.738
Delaney's parents...

15:09.740 --> 15:11.442
First cousins.

15:12.543 --> 15:13.543
You can tell.

15:13.545 --> 15:15.877
Facial asymmetry,
bed wetting,

15:15.879 --> 15:17.316
his teeth never meet.

15:18.950 --> 15:20.750
Uh, so you went
around the world,

15:20.752 --> 15:22.421
- huh?
- Yup.

15:23.654 --> 15:26.521
Did you go alone or...

15:26.523 --> 15:28.723
Me alone? No.
No, no, no.

15:28.725 --> 15:31.126
Well, yeah,
I went there alone but...

15:31.128 --> 15:33.062
Oh, come on,
I was never really...

15:33.064 --> 15:36.200
Alone-alone if you
know what I mean.

15:38.002 --> 15:39.367
Wow, this is too easy.

15:39.369 --> 15:41.603
It's like shooting fish
in a barrel.

15:41.605 --> 15:43.405
I'm kidding, Walt.

15:43.407 --> 15:44.841
Oh... Oh...

15:44.843 --> 15:47.410
You're wound really
tight, you know that?

15:47.412 --> 15:48.910
Have you always
been that way?

15:48.912 --> 15:50.213
- No, um...
- Okay.

15:50.215 --> 15:51.649
Confession time.

15:52.383 --> 15:54.549
When I was little,

15:54.551 --> 15:56.721
I didn't think fat
people could feel things.

16:00.591 --> 16:01.793
Well, your turn.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.364
I got invited to a lunch.

16:06.730 --> 16:08.097
So, uh...

16:08.099 --> 16:10.068
- I should probably...
- Yup.

16:11.099 --> 16:11.470
Okay.

16:16.541 --> 16:19.308
Hey, man,
what do you know about Ellie?

16:19.310 --> 16:21.513
What like
measurements and stuff?

16:22.680 --> 16:26.248
No. No, like, she's
kind of weird, right?

16:26.250 --> 16:28.517
Is that just her
sense of humor?

16:28.519 --> 16:31.823
Well, I know she jokes about her
period a lot if that's what you mean?

16:33.957 --> 16:36.358
Okay. Um...

16:36.360 --> 16:38.093
Do you know if
she's got a boyfriend?

16:38.095 --> 16:39.261
I just...

16:39.263 --> 16:40.695
Some times I have a tough
time telling the difference

16:40.697 --> 16:42.698
between a nice girl
being flirty

16:42.700 --> 16:44.703
and a flirty girl
being nice, you know.

16:45.736 --> 16:47.435
Well, I don't think so.

16:47.437 --> 16:49.171
She got kind of messed up

16:49.173 --> 16:51.006
'cause her brother
got killed in a car crash

16:51.008 --> 16:52.674
out on 35 a few months back.

16:52.676 --> 16:54.544
Her parents became
shut-ins or something.

16:54.546 --> 16:56.581
That's why she went
on that trip and everything.

17:02.287 --> 17:04.955
Come on, I got chicken burning.
Ticktock, ticktock.

17:05.990 --> 17:07.423
Excuse me?

17:07.425 --> 17:09.192
I'm sorry, papo, I didn't
mean to rush you there.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.395
Have at it.

17:11.262 --> 17:12.829
Do you have a problem?

17:14.031 --> 17:16.365
Yes, sir.
You smell like a creek.

17:16.367 --> 17:17.633
What do you got coupons?

17:17.635 --> 17:19.300
You got one of them
for the next year of your life?

17:19.303 --> 17:21.604
Come on. You may only
have moments to live.

17:21.606 --> 17:22.637
Go.

17:22.638 --> 17:25.508
Go. Come on.
Gather your rose buds.

17:25.510 --> 17:27.041
- Asshole.
- Idiot.

17:27.044 --> 17:29.413
For me and whatever the old
man of the sea is having.

17:32.449 --> 17:33.985
What's wrong with you?

17:35.520 --> 17:36.586
Walt?

17:36.588 --> 17:38.891
Oh, uh... Nothing.
I'm good.

17:42.193 --> 17:44.126
What?

17:44.128 --> 17:46.965
My trainer says I can eat
whatever I want to once a week.

17:48.299 --> 17:50.536
You mean your brother?

17:51.369 --> 17:53.069
Yeah, my brother.

17:53.071 --> 17:55.637
Bet my life savings
you don't live three more years.

17:55.639 --> 17:57.508
Tell Walt what
you have there.

17:59.142 --> 18:00.175
Nothing.

18:00.177 --> 18:02.513
Please. I want to
hear you tell him.

18:05.015 --> 18:07.316
It's a little
plate and fork.

18:07.318 --> 18:08.818
It's a little
plate and fork.

18:08.820 --> 18:11.857
And why do you have a little
plate and fork, Delaney?

18:12.623 --> 18:14.790
So, I don't eat too much.

18:14.792 --> 18:16.828
Isn't that about the saddest
thing you ever heard?

18:19.330 --> 18:21.630
Always seem sad, Delaney.

18:21.632 --> 18:24.433
You don't seem to miss
any meals in your anguish.

18:24.435 --> 18:26.034
I'm on Lipitor.

18:26.036 --> 18:26.971
Walt, are you...

18:27.938 --> 18:29.305
You enjoying your job so far?

18:29.307 --> 18:31.240
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

18:31.242 --> 18:34.210
Good. You know we got
that big meeting today.

18:34.212 --> 18:35.681
What do you
think that's about?

18:36.414 --> 18:38.446
It's about
the future, Delaney.

18:38.448 --> 18:40.415
You two idiots can die
in your sleep for all I care.

18:40.417 --> 18:42.151
But not me.
I got ambitions.

18:42.153 --> 18:45.354
Shoot for the moon and if miss,
I fall back among the stars.

18:45.356 --> 18:47.155
Been my philosophy.

18:47.157 --> 18:50.829
Well, ain't the moon closer
than the stars, Blundale?

18:53.231 --> 18:55.030
<i>As most of you know,</i>

18:55.032 --> 18:56.499
<i>many years ago I met...</i>

18:56.501 --> 18:59.437
and I fell in love
with Blundale's mama.

19:00.437 --> 19:02.107
Sticky Vicky herself.

19:03.340 --> 19:05.774
She the light of my life.

19:05.776 --> 19:08.580
And many years later,
upon her retirement,

19:09.613 --> 19:11.682
I was made General Manager
of this here place.

19:12.716 --> 19:14.049
Now...

19:14.051 --> 19:17.219
I know my life won't go down in
history textbooks or anything

19:17.221 --> 19:21.523
but work has always given me a
reason to get up every morning.

19:21.525 --> 19:23.358
Whether I was running
the Antique mall

19:23.360 --> 19:27.666
or selling amphetamines out of the
trunk of my 1976 Chrysler Cordoba.

19:28.632 --> 19:30.866
But...

19:30.868 --> 19:33.405
I'm afraid those chapters
are coming to a close.

19:37.140 --> 19:40.646
Born alone we die alone,
friends, you're never happy.

19:41.745 --> 19:42.714
But work...

19:43.481 --> 19:45.580
gives us meaning,

19:45.582 --> 19:48.550
give us purpose,
give us a reason to believe

19:48.552 --> 19:51.753
that our lives,
however brief, are significant.

19:51.755 --> 19:54.022
Now, all I got in this world

19:54.024 --> 19:56.058
is this job,

19:56.060 --> 19:57.796
a 70-year-old wife,

19:58.529 --> 20:00.932
occasional lifestyle diabetes,

20:02.100 --> 20:04.136
and a 1967...

20:05.235 --> 20:07.638
Mustang Shelby Convertible

20:08.872 --> 20:12.076
that Vicky wants me to
trade in for a Winnebago.

20:14.044 --> 20:15.978
So, in a month,

20:15.980 --> 20:17.812
I'll be leaving here...

20:17.814 --> 20:19.048
for good,

20:19.050 --> 20:21.149
to travel with her.

20:21.151 --> 20:23.618
Ivy park after ivy park,

20:23.620 --> 20:27.589
each one a little more pitiful
and depressing than the last

20:27.591 --> 20:29.992
until we hit all the states.

20:29.994 --> 20:33.963
Our moronic accomplishments
emblazoned on a magnetic map

20:33.965 --> 20:35.567
on the side of the RV.

20:36.434 --> 20:38.800
And only her scooter chair

20:38.802 --> 20:42.637
to escape our
150 square foot hellhole

20:42.639 --> 20:45.076
in her insipid, insane shit.

20:46.577 --> 20:49.211
And so, I need
a replacement, people.

20:49.213 --> 20:51.246
In the coming weeks,

20:51.248 --> 20:54.683
I'll be taking applications for
the position of General Manager

20:54.685 --> 20:56.585
and Director of Estate Sales.

20:56.587 --> 20:59.555
And I'll be interviewing
from outside as well as within.

20:59.557 --> 21:01.589
So, if any of you
are interested

21:01.591 --> 21:03.425
including you select vendors,

21:03.427 --> 21:04.795
let me know.

21:07.865 --> 21:09.534
Let me know.

21:12.503 --> 21:14.239
Well, you'll know
where I'll be.

21:15.305 --> 21:16.271
Let's get back to work.

21:16.273 --> 21:17.405
Walter!

21:17.407 --> 21:19.040
Let me see you in my office.

21:19.042 --> 21:19.977
Yes, sir.

21:21.344 --> 21:22.747
Hey.

21:23.313 --> 21:24.914
Hey.

21:24.916 --> 21:27.817
Look I'm sorry if I made you feel all
uncomfortable and awkward earlier.

21:27.819 --> 21:30.219
- No. No, it's okay.
- Well, let me make it up to you.

21:30.221 --> 21:31.386
I'll buy you
coffee after work.

21:31.388 --> 21:33.657
No. No, no. It's uh...
I'm good. It's okay.

21:36.561 --> 21:38.560
- Oh, uh...
- Yup.

21:38.562 --> 21:39.962
- What?
- No?

21:39.964 --> 21:42.100
Walter!
Need to see you in my office.

21:52.310 --> 21:55.246
Walt, how long you been here?

21:56.481 --> 21:58.750
Uh, today.
I started today.

22:00.451 --> 22:02.617
How are you,
by the way?

22:02.619 --> 22:04.089
I'm good.

22:06.189 --> 22:10.559
I never met a person have a bad
thing to say about your daddy.

22:10.561 --> 22:12.595
I know this isn't the
easiest thing to deal with

22:12.597 --> 22:14.800
especially since
it happened like it did.

22:15.832 --> 22:18.533
I got a therapist lady in town.

22:18.535 --> 22:21.537
Got me through a tough time.

22:21.539 --> 22:23.371
I'm gonna set it up
and you're gonna see her.

22:23.373 --> 22:24.706
Yeah, I appreciate that

22:24.708 --> 22:26.474
but I-I don't think
that I really...

22:26.476 --> 22:27.909
- I had some trauma.
- Mm-hmm.

22:27.911 --> 22:31.646
My sisters husband
was taken too soon.

22:31.648 --> 22:35.416
He owned a chicken farm
out off of, uh...

22:35.418 --> 22:38.052
Behind the old wax museum.

22:38.054 --> 22:41.523
It's at, uh, Henry Street,
Maple, down up and through there.

22:41.525 --> 22:42.760
Well, anyway.

22:43.528 --> 22:46.060
By the time anyone found him,

22:46.062 --> 22:48.800
his arms and legs
were chewed off.

22:50.033 --> 22:51.599
Once that thing
got him to the ground

22:51.601 --> 22:53.304
it literally ate him to death.

22:57.007 --> 22:59.043
The... chicken?

23:01.311 --> 23:02.246
A chicken?

23:03.648 --> 23:06.749
No, the bobcat, son.

23:06.751 --> 23:08.951
Chickens only grow
to about eight pounds.

23:08.953 --> 23:10.418
I don't think they
have teeth, do they?

23:10.420 --> 23:12.023
I don't,
I don't think so.

23:13.291 --> 23:14.826
Now, where was I?

23:15.993 --> 23:16.895
Death.

23:17.727 --> 23:20.796
There is not
a day that goes by

23:20.798 --> 23:24.399
that I don't think, why
the world did that bobcat

23:24.401 --> 23:27.771
eat all the skin but
leave all that organ meat?

23:28.805 --> 23:30.941
Whole torso right there.

23:38.949 --> 23:39.882
So!

23:39.884 --> 23:41.186
What did you think
about the meeting?

23:42.086 --> 23:43.452
It was, it was good.

23:43.454 --> 23:44.723
Now, you got that look.

23:45.723 --> 23:46.858
The look of management.

23:48.725 --> 23:52.027
I really appreciate
that, Mr. Chism, but, uh,

23:52.029 --> 23:53.828
I definitely don't want
to step on anyone's toes,

23:53.830 --> 23:56.130
- and I know that Blundale...
- Yeah, yeah, Blundale...

23:56.132 --> 23:58.934
The man's mother didn't think he'd
be a good fit for this position.

23:58.936 --> 24:02.171
This, this position
requires people skills.

24:02.173 --> 24:03.275
Someone like you.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.139
Like us.

24:05.141 --> 24:07.309
And the only toes you need
to worry about stepping on

24:07.311 --> 24:09.877
are under this desk,
covered in athlete's foot.

24:09.879 --> 24:12.513
See, I laced-up
my old track shoes recently,

24:12.515 --> 24:13.982
keep my stamina up.

24:13.984 --> 24:14.750
Get it?

24:14.752 --> 24:15.951
Sex stamina.

24:15.953 --> 24:19.187
Listen. Just go to this
estate sale with me.

24:19.189 --> 24:21.490
Let's see if it's something
you'd even be interested in.

24:21.492 --> 24:23.658
And if it makes you
that uncomfortable,

24:23.660 --> 24:25.728
Blundale does not have
to know about it.

24:25.730 --> 24:27.065
We'll keep it between us.

25:47.677 --> 25:49.344
Hey, good morning!

25:49.346 --> 25:51.346
Hey, Walt!

25:51.348 --> 25:53.449
Oh, I see you
found those little boots!

25:53.451 --> 25:54.582
Oh yeah, aren't these great?

25:54.584 --> 25:55.452
Yeah.

25:55.919 --> 25:57.154
Oh, look at this.

25:58.089 --> 26:00.621
This'll be
your great grandpa.

26:00.623 --> 26:02.292
My goodness,
he was a good man.

26:03.394 --> 26:04.396
They said he had a...

26:04.962 --> 26:06.231
heavy heart, though.

26:08.631 --> 26:10.132
Heavy...

26:10.134 --> 26:11.436
Heavy heart.

26:15.973 --> 26:17.705
And... why is that?

26:17.707 --> 26:19.607
Made of gold, ha!

26:19.609 --> 26:21.342
- Ha!
- Yep, yep.

26:21.344 --> 26:22.546
Ha ha. Yep.

26:27.384 --> 26:29.885
You know, he built this
house with his own two hands.

26:29.887 --> 26:31.552
No, I didn't.

26:31.554 --> 26:33.021
He sure did,
he sure did.

26:33.023 --> 26:35.089
With this hammer,
actually.

26:35.091 --> 26:36.994
- Really?
- Well, maybe not this hammer, but...

26:37.660 --> 26:38.862
one like it, I'm sure.

26:42.265 --> 26:43.699
I, uh...

26:43.701 --> 26:45.067
I think I remember
my dad saying that

26:45.069 --> 26:47.235
he got arrested for
bootlegging at one point.

26:47.237 --> 26:48.505
Uh ha!

26:49.240 --> 26:50.542
Now that's rich.

26:53.244 --> 26:55.743
I dunno. He said that
a few times actually.

26:55.745 --> 26:57.111
No, no, no.

26:57.113 --> 26:59.316
I, I'm sure old Dennis
was just funnin' ya.

27:05.356 --> 27:08.859
All right, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna head out.

27:10.194 --> 27:10.925
Yep!

27:10.927 --> 27:13.263
Yep... yep, yep, yep.

27:15.032 --> 27:16.865
Have you ever been
to counseling before?

27:16.867 --> 27:18.536
No, no I haven't.

27:25.176 --> 27:27.675
And what made you
wanna come see me today?

27:27.677 --> 27:31.180
Um, I didn't, necessarily.

27:31.182 --> 27:35.216
I mean, uh, Dewey Ray
Chism suggested that I did.

27:35.218 --> 27:37.251
Because, uh,
my dad died recently.

27:37.253 --> 27:39.357
Did you have a good
relationship with your father?

27:40.023 --> 27:41.959
Yeah, I think so.

27:42.760 --> 27:44.393
Uh, my dad grew up here.

27:44.395 --> 27:46.595
So I came back to...

27:46.597 --> 27:47.796
get to know who he is.

27:47.798 --> 27:48.933
Uh, was.

27:49.166 --> 27:50.132
Uh...

27:50.134 --> 27:52.401
Get to know who he was
as a kid.

27:52.403 --> 27:53.404
That kind of thing.

27:57.340 --> 27:58.507
Uh, is that...

27:58.509 --> 27:59.974
is that weird, er...

27:59.976 --> 28:02.647
So you came back here to...

28:03.880 --> 28:06.280
To live in his old house,

28:06.282 --> 28:08.416
talk to the people
that he knew,

28:08.418 --> 28:09.251
work at his old job,

28:09.253 --> 28:10.487
go through all his old things.

28:13.523 --> 28:16.390
Yeah, yeah that's a
little weird, isn't it.

28:16.392 --> 28:17.592
Little weird!

28:17.594 --> 28:18.659
Little weird!

28:18.661 --> 28:20.529
I'm sorry, please ignore her.

28:20.531 --> 28:22.664
She's a therapy animal.

28:23.967 --> 28:27.001
Uh, it's a very innovative
new therapy for narcissists.

28:27.003 --> 28:28.537
- Hm.
- Parrots back what they say,

28:28.539 --> 28:31.339
so they can reflect upon their
words a little more carefully.

28:31.341 --> 28:32.674
Ah.

28:32.676 --> 28:33.544
Very helpful.

28:33.910 --> 28:35.379
So.

28:37.046 --> 28:38.413
You were saying?

28:38.415 --> 28:39.647
Oh, um...

28:39.649 --> 28:41.750
Is this... crazy?

28:41.752 --> 28:44.185
- Is this crazy what I'm doing?
- Is this crazy!

28:44.187 --> 28:45.587
- Stop it!
- Is this crazy!

28:45.589 --> 28:48.089
Beverley.

28:48.091 --> 28:52.629
Sorry, she just, she gets
a little nervous around new patients, so.

28:53.597 --> 28:55.563
Um, let's see.

28:55.565 --> 28:57.134
You were talking...

28:57.901 --> 28:59.269
about...

29:04.440 --> 29:05.674
Dead father?

29:05.676 --> 29:06.774
Dead father?

29:06.776 --> 29:07.909
Dead father?

29:07.911 --> 29:09.912
Dead father?

29:09.914 --> 29:11.245
Stop it, Beverly.

29:11.247 --> 29:13.750
You are ruining
this for me!

29:15.852 --> 29:17.087
Do you understand?

29:31.601 --> 29:33.338
That has never happened.

29:34.838 --> 29:36.107
Please continue.

29:44.214 --> 29:45.282
Hey!

29:46.116 --> 29:48.051
Take a look at the
set on that gal.

29:50.753 --> 29:52.087
Oh yeah.

29:52.089 --> 29:54.856
Look at
those dirty fellas.

29:54.858 --> 29:56.258
Lord,
I bet she could

29:56.260 --> 29:59.163
throw that left one over her
right shoulder, couldn't she.

30:00.664 --> 30:02.200
In a good way!

30:03.634 --> 30:05.670
Just wanna get
between 'em, don't ya?

30:08.871 --> 30:10.305
Little bit a this.

30:12.976 --> 30:15.746
Look at us,
couple of old tomcats!

30:16.914 --> 30:20.648
Boys will be boys,
Maxine girl.

30:20.650 --> 30:22.119
This is the way we talk.

30:24.120 --> 30:25.619
Yeah,
he's a natural athlete.

30:25.621 --> 30:28.190
Not big, mind you, but
natural 'cause he was smart.

30:28.192 --> 30:29.890
I didn't even know he boxed.

30:29.892 --> 30:34.296
Yeah! I remember that
fight he had with this boy, Two Gun,

30:34.298 --> 30:36.598
Big ol' corn-fed son
of a bitch, you know.

30:36.600 --> 30:39.201
Your daddy walks over
to Two-Gun and, uh...

30:39.203 --> 30:41.736
Two-Gun, just, pow!
Right in the mouth.

30:41.738 --> 30:43.004
Knocks his mouthpiece out.

30:43.006 --> 30:45.240
Your daddy looked at me
and winked...

30:45.242 --> 30:47.376
Took that mouthpiece and
threw it over his shoulder.

30:47.378 --> 30:49.411
Went right on back in there
and fought the other two rounds

30:49.413 --> 30:51.078
- without a mouthpiece.
- You ready?

30:51.080 --> 30:52.280
Oh, yeah.

30:52.282 --> 30:53.348
Thank you so much, coach.

30:53.350 --> 30:55.049
Oh, sure.
Any time, any time.

30:55.051 --> 30:56.119
Right, coach.

30:56.520 --> 30:57.919
Um.

30:57.921 --> 31:02.691
Did you happen to say anything
to Blundale about me going today?

31:02.693 --> 31:03.692
Of course I did.

31:03.694 --> 31:04.725
Had to.

31:04.727 --> 31:05.894
You're taking his place.

31:05.896 --> 31:07.095
Yeah, yeah.

31:07.097 --> 31:08.763
It's just that, uh,

31:08.765 --> 31:13.501
I thought that we had talked about
maybe not saying anything to him?

31:13.503 --> 31:14.502
Oh yeah.

31:14.504 --> 31:15.372
I remember.

31:16.305 --> 31:18.542
Have I ever told you the parable

31:19.042 --> 31:20.544
about the turtle

31:21.044 --> 31:22.212
and the scorpion?

31:22.579 --> 31:24.115
Uh, no.

31:25.049 --> 31:27.251
The turtle shouldn't trust
the scorpion.

31:28.651 --> 31:32.222
Not totally sure that
you understand parables.

31:33.924 --> 31:35.357
I'm not sure

31:35.359 --> 31:37.294
that you understand scorpions.

31:39.963 --> 31:41.663
Hey, uh...

31:41.665 --> 31:43.964
Could you give me a minute
and I'll be right out?

31:43.966 --> 31:46.001
Yeah, mine will be
the Mustang out front,

31:46.003 --> 31:47.304
thumping some Creedence.

31:56.946 --> 31:58.680
Hey!

31:58.682 --> 31:59.748
Hey!

31:59.750 --> 32:01.082
Hi.

32:01.084 --> 32:04.654
So I just wanted to say that that
all came out wrong the other day.

32:05.388 --> 32:06.256
What?

32:07.390 --> 32:08.692
Oh, you mean the "No"?

32:09.126 --> 32:10.157
Yeah.

32:10.159 --> 32:11.225
Uh...

32:11.227 --> 32:13.194
I think I just got
caught off guard.

32:13.196 --> 32:15.433
Oh, you mean that you just
weren't paying attention.

32:16.632 --> 32:17.732
Wow.

32:17.734 --> 32:19.634
That's even worse than now.

32:19.636 --> 32:21.703
You really shouldn't
talk so much.

32:21.705 --> 32:23.070
Yeah. Um...

32:23.072 --> 32:24.739
But...

32:24.741 --> 32:26.575
If you ever do
wanna hangout sometime,

32:26.577 --> 32:28.479
I would definitely like
to do that.

32:29.178 --> 32:30.447
Yeah!

32:31.180 --> 32:32.981
You know what, I'm good.

32:32.983 --> 32:34.217
Thank you, though.

32:38.021 --> 32:40.088
Yeah,
okay, no big deal.

32:40.090 --> 32:42.624
I am gonna go ahead
and, uh,

32:42.626 --> 32:44.826
you know,
head on out, so.

32:44.828 --> 32:46.595
Wow, that's it, huh?

32:46.597 --> 32:48.733
Oh, Peter Persistence over here.

32:50.434 --> 32:51.869
You were joking.

32:53.203 --> 32:55.339
Oh no, I don't wanna
hang out with you ever.

32:59.642 --> 33:00.375
Okay, I'm done.

33:00.377 --> 33:01.712
I'm done. I'm done.

33:02.812 --> 33:03.611
With the joking.

33:03.613 --> 33:06.181
Yes, you can
take me out tonight.

33:06.183 --> 33:10.117
Oh, uh, actually I promised Nanaw
I'd take her to bingo tonight.

33:10.119 --> 33:11.286
That's great!

33:11.288 --> 33:12.854
I love bingo!

33:12.856 --> 33:13.858
And nanaws.

33:16.092 --> 33:18.795
I will pick you up at 6:15.

33:20.464 --> 33:22.366
Four-fifty
for the old credenza.

33:23.533 --> 33:24.901
And 600...

33:25.369 --> 33:26.971
for the sideboard.

33:30.607 --> 33:31.676
Woah!

33:32.242 --> 33:34.341
I see ya.

33:34.343 --> 33:36.978
Sir, you're just like
your daddy.

33:36.980 --> 33:38.716
Don't get emotionally involved.

33:39.148 --> 33:40.781
Hmm?

33:40.783 --> 33:43.251
I'm gonna go get started in the kitchen.
Come in there when you get caught up.

33:43.253 --> 33:44.321
- All right.
- All right.

33:52.562 --> 33:53.930
How much for the glasses?

33:56.065 --> 33:57.264
You wan this reading glasses?

33:57.266 --> 33:58.568
Yeah! How much?

34:02.238 --> 34:04.071
Uh, those aren't for sale.

34:04.073 --> 34:05.740
Excuse me?

34:05.742 --> 34:08.346
Well there's plenty of stuff around
here that's for sale, but these aren't.

34:23.893 --> 34:24.992
Hey!

34:24.994 --> 34:27.529
Won't you take a look
at this ol' boy right here?

34:27.531 --> 34:28.398
Huh?

34:29.266 --> 34:30.965
Hell, I like 'em boots!

34:30.967 --> 34:32.067
Oh, yeah, thanks.

34:32.069 --> 34:33.034
They were,
they were my dad's

34:33.036 --> 34:34.735
Just found 'em.

34:34.737 --> 34:37.542
I know how important a
dad's things are to his boy.

34:38.107 --> 34:39.206
Speaking of which,

34:39.208 --> 34:40.942
what did you think
of the estate sale?

34:40.944 --> 34:43.844
Yeah, hey, look. I didn't mean to
get in the way or anything like that.

34:43.846 --> 34:45.179
In the way?

34:45.181 --> 34:46.681
Come on, now.

34:46.683 --> 34:48.753
Ain't nothin' like a little healthy
competition hurt nobody, huh?

34:49.085 --> 34:50.117
Yep.

34:53.056 --> 34:53.925
Okay.

35:02.799 --> 35:04.001
There he is!

35:04.768 --> 35:05.636
Look at him!

35:07.136 --> 35:09.070
Looks to me like
you may have a date!

35:09.072 --> 35:10.237
Who's the victim
there, Walt?

35:10.239 --> 35:11.840
Uh, just a girl.

35:11.842 --> 35:12.808
Just a girl?

35:12.810 --> 35:15.043
You know, I was just
a girl to Henry once.

35:15.045 --> 35:18.683
But then I sacrificed
my body to birth his child.

35:19.382 --> 35:20.850
Nine pounds,
six ounces.

35:21.784 --> 35:24.085
Hey, hey!
What do we got here?

35:24.087 --> 35:25.520
Ho-ho!

35:25.522 --> 35:27.021
Oh God,
that's nothing.

35:27.023 --> 35:29.224
Just some more of my dad's
stuff that I found in the attic.

35:29.226 --> 35:31.192
You know, Dennis's
crazy friends would,

35:31.194 --> 35:33.795
would put those under the bed
and try to get him in trouble

35:33.797 --> 35:34.929
with Mom and Dad.

35:34.931 --> 35:37.866
I'd clear 'em out
so he didn't, of course!

35:37.868 --> 35:41.268
He must've saved some as a joke.

35:41.270 --> 35:42.473
Give me those, Spence.

35:45.942 --> 35:49.444
Well, I hope "just a girl"
gets a name real soon

35:49.446 --> 35:50.512
and we get
to meet her!

35:51.848 --> 35:53.715
Dad, Spence, come on.
Leave him be.

35:53.717 --> 35:55.753
Okay, Mom.
Go get 'em, tiger.

36:33.623 --> 36:34.355
Whew!

36:34.357 --> 36:36.023
Woah, uh, you okay?

36:36.025 --> 36:37.291
Yeah!

36:37.293 --> 36:40.431
I'd invite you inside, but I
just took a huge number one.

36:41.364 --> 36:42.630
A number one?

36:42.632 --> 36:45.132
Yeah, you know,
I'm not good with numbers.

36:46.270 --> 36:49.704
Uh, those, those power
lines are really intense.

36:49.706 --> 36:51.473
Oh, yeah,
you get used to 'em.

36:51.475 --> 36:53.574
Well, except sometimes
the TV turns on by itself,

36:53.576 --> 36:56.244
and I think I can read
people's minds now.

36:56.246 --> 36:57.878
Pick a number
one through ten.

36:57.880 --> 36:59.616
Uh, okay, um...

37:01.051 --> 37:02.150
Okay.

37:02.152 --> 37:03.020
Uh, got it.

37:04.520 --> 37:05.786
Now, say it out loud.

37:05.788 --> 37:07.020
Oh! Uh...

37:07.022 --> 37:07.956
Four.

37:07.958 --> 37:08.889
Yes!

37:08.891 --> 37:09.824
Four!

37:09.826 --> 37:11.393
Look at you!

37:11.395 --> 37:12.663
All right, you ready?

37:15.766 --> 37:17.297
Uh, Ellie,
this is Nanaw.

37:17.299 --> 37:18.868
Oh, hi, Nanaw!

37:19.168 --> 37:20.235
Okay.

37:20.237 --> 37:21.105
Well...

37:22.205 --> 37:23.074
What's your nanaw's name?

37:23.839 --> 37:25.172
Uh...

37:25.174 --> 37:26.241
I, uh...

37:26.243 --> 37:27.478
I don't know
her name.

37:29.145 --> 37:30.512
You don't know
your nanaw's name.

37:30.514 --> 37:32.947
Oh, yeah, well
she's not my nanaw.

37:32.949 --> 37:34.849
Uh, my aunt and uncle
run a bed and breakfast,

37:34.851 --> 37:36.884
and, uh, she came to
stay about 20 years ago

37:36.886 --> 37:38.955
and just, kinda,
never left.

37:39.355 --> 37:40.288
Who did?

37:40.290 --> 37:41.755
- Yeah, you did!
- Yeah!

37:41.757 --> 37:43.560
Let's play some bingo!

37:45.060 --> 37:46.263
I-26!

37:50.199 --> 37:52.002
N-41!

37:56.440 --> 37:58.275
O-71!

38:01.744 --> 38:03.147
G-54!

38:04.915 --> 38:06.413
Yes! Bingo!

38:06.415 --> 38:07.951
I told you
I was gonna win.

38:17.627 --> 38:18.960
That's a bingo, folks!

38:18.962 --> 38:19.927
Whoo-hoo!

38:19.929 --> 38:21.563
Thank you!

38:21.565 --> 38:23.565
Thanks!
Thank you, everyone.

38:25.235 --> 38:26.737
Going with the ham.

38:29.371 --> 38:30.607
Spinal cut, too.

38:31.308 --> 38:32.610
- You jealous?
- Little bit.

38:34.610 --> 38:36.110
I love it here.

38:36.112 --> 38:38.014
I love bingo,
I love ham.

38:39.748 --> 38:41.215
So what's next, cowboy?

38:41.217 --> 38:42.483
Oh, you won
so we could leave.

38:42.485 --> 38:43.451
Is that it?

38:43.453 --> 38:44.485
That's how
it works?

38:45.554 --> 38:47.588
Well, I wasn't gonna
say anything, but...

38:47.590 --> 38:49.123
This one over here?

38:49.125 --> 38:51.094
Not winning anything.

38:54.531 --> 38:57.431
You've not played bingo
with her before?

38:57.433 --> 38:59.102
We've done it
once or twice, yep.

39:00.136 --> 39:01.134
Uh...

39:01.136 --> 39:02.436
Hey, uh...

39:02.438 --> 39:04.304
- On a serious note, uh...
- Ooh.

39:04.306 --> 39:05.609
A serious note?

39:07.310 --> 39:10.181
I just wanna say that I was
sorry to hear about your brother.

39:11.581 --> 39:13.648
Yeah, well.

39:13.650 --> 39:15.586
He was a real
son of a bitch anyway.

39:16.418 --> 39:17.288
Really?

39:17.587 --> 39:18.656
Nope.

39:19.221 --> 39:20.657
He was my best friend.

39:22.359 --> 39:24.194
Hey, do you like
to go on rides?

39:26.096 --> 39:27.295
Rides?

39:27.297 --> 39:30.163
So you don't want
to talk about your brother.

39:30.165 --> 39:31.067
Are you afraid of rides?

39:34.003 --> 39:36.603
Um... Rides!

39:36.605 --> 39:38.907
- Are you scared?
- Okay!

39:38.909 --> 39:40.208
Are you afraid
of heights?

39:40.210 --> 39:41.811
- Are you?
- We'll find out.

39:46.315 --> 39:47.748
They're closed.

39:49.219 --> 39:50.317
Oh look.

39:50.319 --> 39:51.621
They're open.

39:54.223 --> 39:55.359
Ta-da!

39:57.127 --> 39:58.895
No, no, no. No.

39:59.395 --> 40:00.864
- No.
- Yes.

40:02.264 --> 40:05.168
Now you just sit
right down here, Nanaw.

40:06.502 --> 40:08.171
You sit down
and enjoy the show.

40:09.538 --> 40:10.975
Which, which show?

40:14.710 --> 40:16.080
Have you always been
such a baby?

40:17.080 --> 40:17.878
What are you...

40:17.880 --> 40:19.215
How do you even know
how to do this?

40:19.583 --> 40:20.718
Ha!

40:21.384 --> 40:22.784
I know how to do everything!

40:22.786 --> 40:24.217
I run this town.

40:24.219 --> 40:25.018
Okay.

40:25.020 --> 40:26.487
- Come on!
- Yeah. This...

40:26.489 --> 40:29.056
- We'll turn it off, and then we'll just...
- Um, oh my gosh.

40:29.058 --> 40:30.894
- What do you think we came here for?
- Oh!

40:31.493 --> 40:32.659
Oh, my gosh.

40:32.661 --> 40:34.397
- Everything is difficult with you.
- Ah!

40:36.132 --> 40:39.333
Just, here. Here's your high chair
'cause you're being such a baby.

40:39.335 --> 40:40.837
Just sit down!

40:45.574 --> 40:46.773
There you go.

40:46.775 --> 40:48.175
You have fun.

40:48.177 --> 40:49.978
No! No, no, no, I'm
not doing this by myself.

40:49.980 --> 40:51.112
- Oh, no.
- Come on.

40:51.114 --> 40:52.679
- No, no, no, don't...
- Someone has to run this or else...

40:52.681 --> 40:53.915
- Don't.
- Oh, no, it's already started.

40:53.917 --> 40:56.183
You better not unhook it
because that would be bad

40:57.186 --> 40:58.018
Oh no! Oh no!

40:58.020 --> 40:59.454
It's not supposed
to make that sound!

40:59.456 --> 41:00.755
- Oh, my god!
- Walt!

41:01.958 --> 41:03.657
Okay,
are you serious?

41:03.659 --> 41:04.692
Are you serious
right now?

41:04.694 --> 41:05.994
So serious!

41:05.996 --> 41:07.094
Does it have a stop?
Is there a stop button?

41:07.096 --> 41:09.232
But I can't stop it
until it's over.

41:12.402 --> 41:13.534
Have you done
this before?

41:13.536 --> 41:14.768
Wait...

41:14.770 --> 41:16.170
- It'll be okay.
- Don't... Slower, slower!

41:16.172 --> 41:18.072
I don't... I can't slow it down!
I don't know how to!

41:18.074 --> 41:20.007
I just know
how to work the lights!

41:20.009 --> 41:23.378
- You wanna go faster?
- No! That's, that's good!

41:23.380 --> 41:24.481
Okay!

41:25.882 --> 41:27.715
Okay, that's good!

41:27.717 --> 41:29.286
Oh my god!

41:32.489 --> 41:34.458
Look at you
having so much fun!

41:43.232 --> 41:45.733
Now, hun, you can't
be mad at him for that.

41:45.735 --> 41:48.069
Have you talked to
your mother about this?

41:48.071 --> 41:49.739
I just don't trust him,
Jimmy Lee.

41:51.273 --> 41:52.442
Excuse me for a second.

41:53.243 --> 41:54.210
Ma'am...

41:56.413 --> 41:57.281
Ma'am!

41:58.748 --> 42:00.348
How old it this?

42:00.350 --> 42:01.418
Let me take a look.

42:02.851 --> 42:05.319
Oh, yes.
This is from 1983,

42:05.321 --> 42:07.554
but I'm afraid that this
one is not for sale.

42:07.556 --> 42:08.556
Oh.

42:08.558 --> 42:09.857
I'm sorry.

42:09.859 --> 42:11.261
I thought
this was a booth.

42:12.328 --> 42:13.397
It is.

42:20.203 --> 42:21.735
Sorry about that.

42:21.737 --> 42:24.107
Is this one vintage as well?

42:26.409 --> 42:27.708
Oh, you know what?

42:27.710 --> 42:31.279
This one is
from 1983 as well.

42:31.281 --> 42:33.547
There is a year-round
Christmas store.

42:33.549 --> 42:37.050
It is just up the street, and they're
gonna have everything that you want.

42:37.052 --> 42:39.022
You don't want
my old junk.

42:40.456 --> 42:41.991
Come again though!

42:43.058 --> 42:44.692
You gotta be making a fortune.

42:44.694 --> 42:45.960
Oh, please.

42:45.962 --> 42:47.695
Women like that
can't have nice things.

42:47.697 --> 42:49.297
Did you see her shoes?

42:49.299 --> 42:50.167
Blundale!

42:50.866 --> 42:52.300
I need to see you
in my office!

42:52.302 --> 42:53.170
Geez.

42:54.670 --> 42:55.839
Good luck!

42:56.739 --> 42:57.838
Training for what?

42:57.840 --> 42:59.474
Because I think he'd make
a good manager.

42:59.476 --> 43:00.407
Who, Walt?

43:00.409 --> 43:01.675
What's he ever done?

43:01.677 --> 43:03.610
Let's go down the line

43:03.612 --> 43:06.681
of the last three estate sales
you've been in charge of.

43:06.683 --> 43:07.918
I don't wanna hear this.

43:08.317 --> 43:09.185
First,

43:09.786 --> 43:10.854
Mrs. Pierce.

43:11.920 --> 43:13.920
You know that house burned
completely to the ground.

43:13.922 --> 43:15.155
Insurance fraud.

43:15.157 --> 43:16.090
She planned it for years.

43:16.092 --> 43:18.058
Remember Mrs. McCuster?

43:18.060 --> 43:20.393
That dog was the last thing
she had from her husband.

43:20.395 --> 43:23.431
How was I supposed to know that dog
was dumb enough to swallow hooks?

43:23.433 --> 43:24.866
Mrs. Hazel.

43:24.868 --> 43:29.770
I see the two of you going to the
bathroom, come out five minutes later.

43:29.772 --> 43:30.971
She has a broken hip.

43:30.973 --> 43:32.940
So I'm to blame
for a calcium deficiency.

43:32.942 --> 43:34.942
I'm not asking you, Blundale.

43:34.944 --> 43:36.045
I'm telling you.

43:36.645 --> 43:38.047
Train him!

43:41.618 --> 43:43.186
I'm heading home.

43:44.654 --> 43:47.054
Your mother's cooking pie rolls.

43:47.056 --> 43:48.625
You're welcome to come and eat.

43:49.525 --> 43:50.493
Just be gone

43:51.194 --> 43:52.295
by 8:00.

43:54.297 --> 43:55.299
It's Tuesday.

43:58.768 --> 44:01.402
I mean, I take these
pills that make me retain water,

44:01.404 --> 44:05.072
but, well, you ever seen one
of them pregnant spiders?

44:05.074 --> 44:05.976
Hmm?

44:07.509 --> 44:08.511
You look nice to me!

44:09.545 --> 44:11.647
Oh... well, thank...

44:13.616 --> 44:14.782
I'm sorry.

44:14.784 --> 44:16.349
Ooh, you're giving me
butterflies!

44:16.351 --> 44:20.089
I guess ever since Randall left,
compliments are few and far between!

44:20.790 --> 44:22.125
Randal was your husband?

44:22.525 --> 44:23.523
Legally?

44:23.525 --> 44:24.692
Uh, yeah, I guess.

44:24.694 --> 44:26.259
Um, left me
two years back, so.

44:26.261 --> 44:28.996
What? really? Why would
anybody leave you?

44:28.998 --> 44:30.565
Guess he wanted
something new.

44:30.567 --> 44:32.603
Because we all want
something new eventually.

44:33.002 --> 44:34.902
That's okay.

44:34.904 --> 44:37.371
Because I'm gonna have
something new myself soon.

44:37.373 --> 44:38.271
That's right.

44:38.273 --> 44:40.541
Like them titties
I was telling you about.

44:40.543 --> 44:43.878
Or I'm a shave a little
off the schnoz.

44:43.880 --> 44:45.779
Oh, those
actually aren't for sale.

44:45.781 --> 44:47.380
They're, uh,
they're a set.

44:47.382 --> 44:49.750
You know, you could...
Yeah, just, just out.

44:49.752 --> 44:53.987
I don't know why he keeps that booth,
considering he won't let anything go.

44:53.989 --> 44:55.422
What do you mean?
He doesn't sell anything?

44:55.424 --> 44:57.724
If you pay attention next
time you're back there,

44:57.726 --> 44:59.427
he's recreated one of his

44:59.429 --> 45:01.061
childhood Christmases.

45:01.063 --> 45:02.762
He won't get out of it.

45:02.764 --> 45:04.234
Blundale's looking
for you.

45:04.868 --> 45:07.136
Oh, I gotta take this, sorry.

45:15.612 --> 45:16.613
How are you doing, Gail?

45:17.313 --> 45:19.112
Sore, mostly.

45:19.114 --> 45:21.114
I've been blasting
my bi's a lot.

45:21.116 --> 45:22.817
Poundin' the plates.

45:22.819 --> 45:24.652
That's good.

45:24.654 --> 45:28.655
I saw your sister at Crank's Grocery
but didn't have a chance to say hi.

45:28.657 --> 45:30.056
How's she and Vernon doing?

45:30.058 --> 45:31.525
They're getting a divorce.

45:31.527 --> 45:32.996
Oh, good for her!

45:34.330 --> 45:35.199
Huh.

45:38.500 --> 45:41.268
Don't think you're supposed to
do those in a row like that.

45:41.270 --> 45:44.070
No, I do five at a time, so I
don't have to remember later.

45:44.072 --> 45:46.574
<i>You said you never
wanted to sell Mom and Dad's house.</i>

45:46.576 --> 45:49.246
Well, I guess I am
ready to move on.

45:50.446 --> 45:51.411
You okay with selling?

45:51.413 --> 45:53.648
<i>Yeah, I mean, I can't even
step into the place.</i>

45:53.650 --> 45:55.049
<i>I've just been waiting on you.</i>

45:55.051 --> 45:56.349
Yeah, I know.

45:56.351 --> 45:58.288
<i>I'll talk to an agent
and get all the paperwork done.</i>

45:58.654 --> 46:00.054
Okay.

46:00.056 --> 46:01.657
- <i>I love you.</i>
- Love you too.

46:09.933 --> 46:13.768
Yeah, I pretty much load up on
multivitamins as soon as I leave the gym.

46:13.770 --> 46:16.137
I've been taking so much ginko
I feel like I can hear

46:16.139 --> 46:17.804
what my neighbors are thinking.

46:17.806 --> 46:19.105
Yeah.

46:19.107 --> 46:21.644
The vitamins have pretty much
cut my body fat in half.

46:22.277 --> 46:24.612
Well, that's something, huh?

46:24.614 --> 46:26.880
Half. Wow.

46:26.882 --> 46:29.650
You know who I think
is very fit?

46:29.652 --> 46:31.085
Walt.

46:31.087 --> 46:34.654
He must run, or do one of those,
like TV type workouts or something,

46:34.656 --> 46:37.590
'cause he's just
slender as a piece of pie.

46:37.592 --> 46:38.992
Yeah.

46:38.994 --> 46:42.395
Yeah, I used to be a little like
that, when I was you know, a kid,

46:42.397 --> 46:45.398
but I think the girls
prefer a more muscular build.

46:45.400 --> 46:48.105
Well, nothing wrong
with being hefty.

46:51.239 --> 46:52.676
What did you say
Blundale needed?

46:53.909 --> 46:56.045
Nothing, man. Like it matters.

46:57.513 --> 46:59.512
Oh, happy family!

46:59.514 --> 47:01.782
Like all them meals
at a special for inbreeds.

47:03.886 --> 47:05.288
Walt, can I just
see you a second here?

47:06.855 --> 47:08.054
Good news, squirt.

47:08.056 --> 47:09.757
Dewey Ray wants me to train you.

47:09.759 --> 47:10.791
Train me for what?

47:10.793 --> 47:12.326
You playing possum with me?

47:12.328 --> 47:13.994
Talkin' about
management, friend!

47:13.996 --> 47:16.297
Looks like somebody's finally
getting out of the kiddie pool,

47:16.299 --> 47:17.734
gonna start swimming
in the deep end.

47:18.900 --> 47:20.337
See that little broad
right there?

47:21.770 --> 47:23.103
Go help her out.

47:23.105 --> 47:24.038
Go on.

47:24.040 --> 47:25.141
- Make me proud.
- Okay.

47:27.143 --> 47:29.076
Hi, ma'am. Can I help you
find something?

47:29.078 --> 47:31.344
Well, I'm looking for a statue,

47:31.346 --> 47:34.315
about 12-16 inches high,

47:34.317 --> 47:39.420
and it's of a man in an
old-fashioned bumblebee swimsuit

47:39.422 --> 47:42.056
and he's running
with a pink flower.

47:42.058 --> 47:45.529
And he has to have an orange
bathing cap on.

47:46.295 --> 47:49.199
Okay, let me check for you.

47:59.609 --> 48:01.311
There you go.

48:03.813 --> 48:05.248
No, that's not it.

48:08.583 --> 48:09.485
Walt.

48:12.822 --> 48:15.755
She there,
batshit crazy.

48:15.757 --> 48:19.626
Comes in here, every week, and wants
the same thing, then doesn't want it.

48:19.628 --> 48:22.829
She's perverse, it's like
she needs friends or something.

48:22.831 --> 48:24.297
Here's what we're gonna do.

48:24.299 --> 48:26.132
You need people skills
for management.

48:26.134 --> 48:28.335
Watch this.

48:28.337 --> 48:30.704
Hey, hey! We don't
need your kind in here.

48:30.706 --> 48:32.940
Your hair looks like you just
came through a birth canal.

48:32.942 --> 48:34.210
And you know it.

48:37.647 --> 48:38.579
Hmm? People skills.

48:38.581 --> 48:40.648
That is a terrible way
to treat somebody.

48:40.650 --> 48:41.982
Shit, if it only worked.

48:41.984 --> 48:43.317
She'll be back next week.

48:43.319 --> 48:44.918
So how'd it go last night?

48:44.920 --> 48:46.353
- With what?
- Huh?

48:46.355 --> 48:48.188
On the date, with my niece.

48:48.190 --> 48:51.527
- Niece.
- Yeah, you did.

48:52.962 --> 48:54.762
- Ellie?
- Yes, Ellie.

48:54.764 --> 48:56.329
That's my brother's girl.

48:56.331 --> 48:58.398
Was she adopted?
Were you adopted?

49:08.677 --> 49:10.246
Hey, Delaney.

49:10.880 --> 49:12.045
What are you doing?

49:12.047 --> 49:13.780
Helium.

49:13.782 --> 49:15.918
Makes things go better
when I'm depressed.

49:19.188 --> 49:21.588
I wanna
ask out Dolores Jr.

49:21.590 --> 49:23.460
It was like she doesn't
even know I'm alive.

49:24.159 --> 49:26.393
Oh, come on.
Of course, she does.

49:26.395 --> 49:28.429
I don't know, man.

49:28.431 --> 49:30.600
Have you not seen
how she looks at you?

49:33.302 --> 49:35.539
Yeah, of course, she, like,
totally wants it.

49:36.739 --> 49:38.172
Yeah.

49:38.174 --> 49:40.541
See? I've thought so. Sometimes,
she'd give me that fast eye, Walt.

49:40.543 --> 49:43.309
I know, and that's because
you're a hell of a guy, Delaney.

49:43.311 --> 49:44.647
She'd be lucky to have you.

49:46.114 --> 49:48.250
- Go ask her out.
- Okay.

49:48.918 --> 49:50.150
Hey, Walt.

49:50.152 --> 49:51.587
Thanks, buddy.

50:03.632 --> 50:06.300
Hello, how are
everybody tonight?

50:06.302 --> 50:08.067
- Good.
- Huh? Good?

50:08.069 --> 50:11.070
Young couple always late. Huh?

50:11.072 --> 50:12.873
Man take too long
to do his hair.

50:12.875 --> 50:14.175
Yup.

50:14.177 --> 50:15.312
You like egg?

50:20.882 --> 50:21.949
Egg.

50:21.951 --> 50:23.786
That seems
a little inappropriate.

50:24.587 --> 50:27.491
Hey, string bean,
show's over here.

50:28.590 --> 50:30.291
I'm killing myself for you here.

50:30.293 --> 50:32.692
What you want white guy?

50:32.694 --> 50:34.597
I guarantee you,
white guys suck.

50:35.130 --> 50:36.600
Ooh.

50:43.105 --> 50:45.572
Oh, man, look at you.

50:45.574 --> 50:48.208
Just a few days in town, and
you're already making friends.

50:48.210 --> 50:50.311
Yeah. Yeah.

50:50.313 --> 50:52.378
So what are you
doing here anyway?

50:52.380 --> 50:54.884
Um, I cam to learn about my dad.

50:55.951 --> 50:57.284
You don't know your dad?

50:57.286 --> 50:58.619
No, I did know him.

50:58.621 --> 51:01.221
Um, he died. A while back.

51:01.223 --> 51:04.625
And, I guess after he died,
I realized I didn't really know him

51:04.627 --> 51:06.862
as well as I thought
I did, you know?

51:07.563 --> 51:09.096
So you guys weren't very close?

51:09.098 --> 51:11.601
No, no, we were,
actually. Uh...

51:12.467 --> 51:13.969
Never felt closer to anyone.

51:14.804 --> 51:18.505
But we-we didn't
really talk though.

51:18.507 --> 51:20.641
I mean, we could say,
"I love you" to each other,

51:20.643 --> 51:23.043
but looking back on it,
I think that maybe

51:23.045 --> 51:25.679
just saying "I love you" all the
time was a way for us to avoid

51:25.681 --> 51:27.551
ever getting
deeper than that.

51:31.453 --> 51:33.689
Does that make any sense?

51:35.257 --> 51:36.560
I think so.

51:39.362 --> 51:41.795
I don't know,
maybe I didn't know him.

51:41.797 --> 51:44.634
The last few months of his life,
we didn't talk at all, actually.

51:44.933 --> 51:46.368
Why not?

51:47.703 --> 51:51.105
Well, after my mom died,
uh, he started to drink

51:51.107 --> 51:54.842
and I told him that I was done
unless he got help.

51:54.844 --> 51:56.079
And he never did?

51:59.681 --> 52:01.915
Called me,
the day before he died.

52:01.917 --> 52:02.949
Wanted to meet me.

52:02.951 --> 52:04.453
What for?

52:06.121 --> 52:07.890
I don't know.
He died on the way.

52:11.761 --> 52:13.460
Well, you know, it's
the same with you though.

52:13.462 --> 52:14.898
I could imagine losing Sarah.

52:16.866 --> 52:18.969
Yeah, well, it's...

52:20.536 --> 52:23.670
You don't talk
about it much, do you?

52:23.672 --> 52:26.540
I don't talk about him
because he's gone,

52:26.542 --> 52:28.909
and there's nothing
to talk about.

52:28.911 --> 52:30.543
How he died,
the way that he died...

52:30.545 --> 52:33.579
Yeah, I barely know the
details about how it happened.

52:33.581 --> 52:36.453
But what good does it
do for me to know that?

52:37.552 --> 52:39.855
Life's too short
for unpleasant things.

52:40.922 --> 52:43.892
Oh, here comes
the old onion volcano.

52:47.163 --> 52:48.728
Do you think that's healthy?

52:48.730 --> 52:51.667
Well, not if there's flames
shooting out of it. No.

52:52.967 --> 52:54.101
I mean your brother...

52:54.103 --> 52:54.971
I know!

53:02.110 --> 53:03.545
Oh! Oh, uh...

53:04.246 --> 53:07.514
Who, hey! You don't pay?

53:07.516 --> 53:10.416
Hey, hey! I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

53:10.418 --> 53:12.886
Listen, I am so so sorry.

53:12.888 --> 53:14.188
I didn't mean to
make you uncomfortable.

53:14.190 --> 53:15.922
- You don't have to talk about it.
- No, it's fine. I...

53:15.924 --> 53:18.425
I should not have asked
about your dad, and I did,

53:18.427 --> 53:21.161
And I just... Oh, God!

53:21.163 --> 53:23.931
Hey, I can...

53:23.933 --> 53:26.032
I can take you home,
if you wanna go home.

53:26.034 --> 53:27.201
No. no, no, no.

53:27.203 --> 53:28.705
No, we, um...

53:30.206 --> 53:31.207
Let's go out.

53:32.574 --> 53:34.741
Now, there's um, there's
this place that I go,

53:34.743 --> 53:36.076
and I just...
I think, by myself,

53:36.078 --> 53:39.215
and I really don't
take anyone there, but...

53:41.183 --> 53:42.552
I'd like to take you there.

53:44.353 --> 53:46.219
Okay. Okay.

53:51.560 --> 53:53.163
Whoo, Pixi!

53:54.196 --> 53:55.462
Hmm?

53:55.464 --> 53:57.697
- Yeah, I don't think this is...
- Get up there.

53:57.699 --> 53:58.831
No.

53:58.833 --> 54:01.804
If you get up there
and dance with Miss Pixi,

54:02.471 --> 54:04.103
I'll kiss you tonight.

54:04.105 --> 54:06.575
That way, you don't have to
worry about me projecting you.

54:10.346 --> 54:12.215
Yeah, I...

54:13.081 --> 54:14.083
Okay.

54:14.884 --> 54:16.016
Okay.

54:16.018 --> 54:17.619
There he goes.

54:40.609 --> 54:42.809
That's nice.
What does that mean?

54:42.811 --> 54:45.445
Oh, I got it to mean "freedom,"
but it just means "free."

54:46.714 --> 54:48.449
The Chinese don't even have
a word for freedom.

54:48.451 --> 54:49.619
Isn't that sad?

54:53.422 --> 54:54.791
Oh, uh...

55:03.431 --> 55:06.266
Oh, hey, I can't
give you all that.

55:06.268 --> 55:07.567
- You just did.
- Oh, no, no, no.

55:07.569 --> 55:09.536
I will tip you, I just can't
give you the whole thing.

55:09.538 --> 55:10.971
Do I look like
a vending machine?

55:10.973 --> 55:11.804
Yeah, it's just...

55:11.806 --> 55:13.308
That $100's
all the money I have.

55:14.275 --> 55:15.675
I can earn it.

55:15.677 --> 55:18.277
No, no, no,
I don't want you to earn it.

55:18.279 --> 55:20.581
I-I just need smaller bills.

55:20.583 --> 55:22.349
I'm not worth $100 to you?

55:22.351 --> 55:24.116
No, no, of course you are!

55:24.118 --> 55:24.987
You make me sick.

55:27.522 --> 55:30.092
Way to go, A-hole!

55:49.811 --> 55:51.080
So...

55:52.614 --> 55:55.014
So, I would say

55:55.016 --> 55:56.717
that we should
get some ice cream,

55:56.719 --> 55:59.319
but apparently, you spent
all your money on hookers.

55:59.321 --> 56:01.420
Uh, her name was Pixi.

56:01.422 --> 56:02.523
Okay?

56:02.525 --> 56:03.556
And she earned it.

56:06.295 --> 56:07.427
Okay.

56:07.429 --> 56:08.665
Uh...

56:10.132 --> 56:11.334
I...

56:12.967 --> 56:14.867
I really do need to talk to you
about something.

56:14.869 --> 56:17.607
Uh, I need to talk to you
about something, too.

56:19.007 --> 56:19.975
Uh...

56:21.176 --> 56:24.947
I know that we haven't
kissed or anything yet, but...

56:29.217 --> 56:30.185
I'm pregnant.

56:34.056 --> 56:36.123
It's a boy.

56:36.125 --> 56:37.627
He's due next week.

56:38.860 --> 56:41.228
I was thinking
about naming him...

57:04.152 --> 57:06.219
Okay, come here.

57:06.221 --> 57:07.290
- Okay.
- Okay.

57:11.759 --> 57:13.326
You're crazy.

57:13.328 --> 57:14.429
Okay.

57:17.299 --> 57:18.632
Come here.

57:18.634 --> 57:20.366
Goodness, sir.

57:20.368 --> 57:21.837
My dad showed me this once.

57:22.538 --> 57:24.139
The electricity in the air.

57:26.507 --> 57:27.843
Wait, wait.

57:50.331 --> 57:51.734
Sorry.

58:28.404 --> 58:29.503
Hey!

58:29.505 --> 58:30.837
You want a piece of this?

58:30.839 --> 58:32.204
I'll show you.

58:32.206 --> 58:33.739
You don't want
a piece of this today!

58:33.741 --> 58:35.574
Do you think I
should've gone with the titties?

58:35.576 --> 58:36.543
No, no.

58:36.545 --> 58:38.145
Oh, you do, don't you?

58:38.147 --> 58:41.348
No, no, no, I think the nose was
definitely the right decision.

58:41.350 --> 58:43.050
Yea? okay, 'cause,

58:43.052 --> 58:45.886
well, the doctor did it for half
the price of a normal nose job

58:45.888 --> 58:47.420
on account that
hr only took half off.

58:47.422 --> 58:51.525
So, now, I could still afford
to get the one titty bigger

58:51.527 --> 58:52.592
so they'll at least match.

58:52.594 --> 58:53.793
I don't know.

58:53.795 --> 58:57.399
I have had
about enough of this shit!

59:01.335 --> 59:04.036
How was your night with Ellie?
Did y'all have a good time?

59:04.038 --> 59:05.073
Yeah.

59:07.109 --> 59:08.775
I heard what you did to Pixi.

59:08.777 --> 59:10.277
Pervert.

59:10.279 --> 59:11.811
That girl's a saint.

59:11.813 --> 59:14.848
I mean, except for the part where
she takes her clothes off for money.

59:14.850 --> 59:18.317
Oh, that Pixi?
Pixi at <i>Crazy Girls?</i>

59:18.319 --> 59:21.587
I love her show! Oh!

59:21.589 --> 59:23.857
Randall and I
used to go all the time.

59:23.859 --> 59:25.994
Well, he used to go a lot,
without me, mostly.

59:26.895 --> 59:28.464
Kind of the beginning
of the end, I guess.

59:29.331 --> 59:31.230
But I went once.

59:31.232 --> 59:33.266
Ellie put me up to it.
It was more of a dare

59:33.268 --> 59:35.601
- than anything...
- Oh, so she's a dare to you now?

59:35.603 --> 59:37.536
No, she is not a dare to me.

59:37.538 --> 59:39.538
Come on, you... It's not what
I meant, and you know it.

59:39.540 --> 59:40.976
Oh!

59:42.177 --> 59:44.110
Damn it!

59:44.112 --> 59:46.712
Just proves to me that you're
unfit to be her boyfriend.

59:46.714 --> 59:48.280
Or to work at this place.

59:48.282 --> 59:49.516
Idiot.

59:49.518 --> 59:51.150
Oh, my goodness.

59:51.152 --> 59:53.686
- Dewey, you sold your Mustang.
- Yup.

59:53.688 --> 59:54.954
All right,
you know what, Blundale?

59:54.956 --> 59:56.322
Hey, Dewey Ray.

59:56.324 --> 59:58.858
I think I do want that
management position after all.

59:58.860 --> 01:00:01.128
Sure, whoa cares?
Y'all will die anyway.

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:03.663
Jimmy Lee, need to see you
in my office.

01:00:03.665 --> 01:00:05.234
I need to go get Daddy.

01:00:10.404 --> 01:00:11.607
Jimmy Lee.

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:16.143
I can't do this anymore.

01:00:16.145 --> 01:00:18.445
Well, that's what I keep
telling you, Dewey.

01:00:18.447 --> 01:00:19.846
You have to stand up to her.

01:00:19.848 --> 01:00:21.384
It's your booth.

01:00:22.683 --> 01:00:24.286
I can't allow you
to stay here.

01:00:29.824 --> 01:00:31.590
What do you mean?

01:00:31.592 --> 01:00:33.328
You're a good man, Jimmy Lee.

01:00:34.496 --> 01:00:35.631
It's killing me to do it.

01:00:37.665 --> 01:00:38.831
Wh...

01:00:38.833 --> 01:00:40.800
Maxine doesn't
cause any trouble,

01:00:40.802 --> 01:00:42.335
and I'm just gone for an hour,

01:00:42.337 --> 01:00:44.003
so whenever I have to
go get Daddy...

01:00:44.005 --> 01:00:45.373
It's not that.

01:00:47.409 --> 01:00:50.409
You haven't paid rent for
that space in three years.

01:00:50.411 --> 01:00:51.545
Well, in this economy,

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:54.848
I don't really see how
anybody could be expected

01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:57.183
to... pay rent.

01:00:57.185 --> 01:01:00.085
Jimmy, I mention this to you
every six months.

01:01:00.087 --> 01:01:01.990
You won't let anything go.

01:01:06.161 --> 01:01:07.761
Please don't do this, Dewey.

01:01:07.763 --> 01:01:09.065
You know how Vic is.

01:01:10.098 --> 01:01:11.398
She wants me to retire,

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.336
do this cross-country
thing with her.

01:01:14.536 --> 01:01:16.268
And we can't do that

01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:19.074
unless all booths are working.

01:01:22.944 --> 01:01:24.580
And I'm sorry, Jimmy Lee.

01:01:26.982 --> 01:01:28.384
I'm sorry too.

01:01:34.422 --> 01:01:35.290
You know...

01:01:37.458 --> 01:01:38.592
I wish that Bo...

01:01:38.594 --> 01:01:41.695
This is a nasty nasty thing
to say to you,

01:01:41.697 --> 01:01:46.035
but I wish that bobcat
would have gotten you instead.

01:01:46.467 --> 01:01:47.536
Jimmy!

01:01:58.547 --> 01:02:00.346
Hey, Dolores Jr.

01:02:00.348 --> 01:02:01.715
Oh.

01:02:01.717 --> 01:02:03.750
Hey, sweet lump of man.

01:02:03.752 --> 01:02:05.184
How are you?

01:02:05.186 --> 01:02:07.786
I was wondering
if you'd like to go out

01:02:07.788 --> 01:02:10.325
to get something
to eat one night.

01:02:11.893 --> 01:02:13.092
Uh.

01:02:13.094 --> 01:02:16.232
Or, if you don't,
it's... Whatever.

01:02:18.532 --> 01:02:20.268
Well, Uh...

01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:23.103
Let me heal my nose first,

01:02:23.105 --> 01:02:25.739
but then, yes, I think
I would like that very much.

01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:27.007
Oh, no, I don't wanna wait.

01:02:27.009 --> 01:02:29.110
I think your new nose
looks great.

01:02:30.811 --> 01:02:32.080
Well,

01:02:32.781 --> 01:02:34.217
if you insist.

01:02:35.683 --> 01:02:40.223
Oh, and it could be
a date, too, I guess. Right?

01:02:41.456 --> 01:02:43.956
Well, then, it should,
it should be very fancy

01:02:43.958 --> 01:02:45.460
because I'm very swanky.

01:02:47.895 --> 01:02:49.497
Swanky!

01:02:50.098 --> 01:02:52.034
Oh, swanky!

01:02:52.467 --> 01:02:53.699
I should...

01:02:53.701 --> 01:02:57.503
Is that a fireplace? Oh, then
let's have champagne by it.

01:02:57.505 --> 01:02:59.405
Oh. Oh, good.

01:02:59.407 --> 01:03:02.108
'Cause I was gonna pick
you up in my uncle's limo

01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:04.576
and we can eat stuff
on those little crostinis

01:03:04.578 --> 01:03:07.649
and we were gonna go up in a
hot-air balloon to watch the sunset.

01:03:09.717 --> 01:03:11.583
I was just joking, hon.

01:03:11.585 --> 01:03:13.686
No! no, no, no.

01:03:13.688 --> 01:03:16.359
You don't have to do anything
special for me.

01:03:17.159 --> 01:03:19.328
- Seriously?
- Yeah, of course.

01:03:20.061 --> 01:03:21.596
Okay then.

01:03:35.409 --> 01:03:37.210
Ellie thinks
I'm a nice guy.

01:03:37.212 --> 01:03:39.311
Right? like, I'm not gonna
stick up for myself.

01:03:39.313 --> 01:03:41.213
That's what Blundale thinks,
isn't it? That's what he thinks.

01:03:41.215 --> 01:03:42.752
I don't care what he wants.

01:03:44.786 --> 01:03:46.656
I don't care about his feelings.

01:03:50.491 --> 01:03:51.690
What's wrong now?

01:03:51.692 --> 01:03:54.126
Well, I don't know
if you know this about me, Walt,

01:03:54.128 --> 01:03:55.695
but I have kind of
low self-esteem,

01:03:55.697 --> 01:03:58.697
and I overcompensate
for my shortcomings

01:03:58.699 --> 01:04:02.235
by lying to make myself
seem better, or smarter,

01:04:02.237 --> 01:04:05.505
or more desirable to others.

01:04:05.507 --> 01:04:07.706
At least, that's
what my aunt says.

01:04:07.708 --> 01:04:10.145
She's into self-help
and Sudoku and all that.

01:04:11.112 --> 01:04:12.580
Is this about
Dolores Jr.?

01:04:14.482 --> 01:04:15.383
Yup.

01:04:16.884 --> 01:04:18.884
Delaney, you
don't need to lie.

01:04:18.886 --> 01:04:20.286
She likes you.

01:04:20.288 --> 01:04:22.389
Yeah, I know that now.

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:24.523
I promised her all this stuff
and I got away with it,

01:04:24.525 --> 01:04:26.159
'cause she said she didn't want
too big to do,

01:04:26.161 --> 01:04:28.795
but that made me realize that

01:04:28.797 --> 01:04:30.666
this girl deserves honesty.

01:04:31.799 --> 01:04:33.568
She deserves an honest man.

01:04:34.735 --> 01:04:37.670
But I get into these
situations and I seize up.

01:04:37.672 --> 01:04:41.041
And the untruths
just start coming out...

01:04:41.043 --> 01:04:43.009
Hey, Dolores Jr.!

01:04:43.011 --> 01:04:44.376
Oh, there you are.

01:04:44.378 --> 01:04:47.313
Listen, Delaney,
I've been thinking.

01:04:47.315 --> 01:04:51.150
All my life, I've tried
not to be a bother to anybody,

01:04:51.152 --> 01:04:52.886
and it turns out, I got my wish.

01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:54.654
So, if you wanna go in a limo

01:04:54.656 --> 01:04:57.724
or a hot-air balloon,
that's just great by me.

01:04:57.726 --> 01:05:00.059
Well, okay.

01:05:00.061 --> 01:05:02.628
But you can't, because

01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:05.167
you already
canceled those things.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:06.733
Oh, yeah.

01:05:06.735 --> 01:05:08.067
Oh, okay. Well, that's...

01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:10.238
Oh, but I could
get them back, no problem.

01:05:11.206 --> 01:05:12.572
Probably with puppies,

01:05:12.574 --> 01:05:15.378
and roses and fireworks
and stuff, too.

01:05:32.259 --> 01:05:33.895
Have a seat.

01:05:36.697 --> 01:05:37.900
Okay.

01:05:39.534 --> 01:05:41.668
Look, I owe you an apology.

01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:44.204
I realized the anger I had
is not about you.

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:46.038
It's about Dewey Ray
and my mother.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.273
What I wanna do,

01:05:47.275 --> 01:05:49.442
figure out a way
to make it up to you.

01:05:49.444 --> 01:05:51.511
Your dad used to wear
those boots in here

01:05:51.513 --> 01:05:53.746
shined up real nice everyday.

01:05:53.748 --> 01:05:56.248
I wanna do that for you,
if you'll let me.

01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:57.953
- No. No, no, no.
- Come on! Truce.

01:05:59.621 --> 01:06:00.623
Please.

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:06.925
Okay.

01:06:06.927 --> 01:06:08.830
There you go, sport. That's it.

01:06:15.203 --> 01:06:17.036
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

01:06:17.038 --> 01:06:18.670
All right.

01:06:24.846 --> 01:06:25.777
Perfect.

01:06:25.779 --> 01:06:27.215
I'll be right back.

01:06:30.418 --> 01:06:32.855
Give me a few minutes. Le
me go get my shoeshine kit.

01:07:12.993 --> 01:07:13.895
Oof.

01:07:14.728 --> 01:07:15.864
Blundale?

01:07:17.965 --> 01:07:19.801
He must really not like you.

01:07:22.603 --> 01:07:24.170
Hey, Delaney, how about
you give me your keys?

01:07:24.172 --> 01:07:25.808
I'll lock up
for you tonight. Hmm?

01:07:27.074 --> 01:07:28.877
Mm, okay.

01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:37.786
Thanks, Walt.

01:08:10.918 --> 01:08:12.451
Wow!

01:08:12.453 --> 01:08:15.554
Now, is that a slaughtered
M. Jeff Thompson,

01:08:15.556 --> 01:08:18.625
the most irascible of all
Confederate soldiers?

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:20.158
What in the world
happened here?

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.362
You know exactly what happened,
you son of a bitch.

01:08:22.363 --> 01:08:26.332
Well, looks to me like someone historically
corrected all your Civil War battles.

01:08:26.334 --> 01:08:27.899
- Good for them!
- You killed them!

01:08:27.901 --> 01:08:29.969
You murdered hundreds
of Confederate soldiers.

01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:33.305
Uh, okay, uh,
first of all, they're toys,

01:08:33.307 --> 01:08:35.375
and secondly, I didn't
kill them, the Union did.

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:36.743
They're my battles!

01:08:36.745 --> 01:08:38.211
You're rewriting history!

01:08:38.212 --> 01:08:39.612
The South won all these!

01:08:39.613 --> 01:08:42.482
That is Gettysburg!
Get-tys-burg!

01:08:42.484 --> 01:08:44.448
One of the biggest battles
in the Civil War.

01:08:44.451 --> 01:08:46.051
My wars can end
any way I want them to.

01:08:46.053 --> 01:08:47.752
You weren't invited to play!

01:08:47.755 --> 01:08:48.755
Oh, you gonna...

01:08:48.756 --> 01:08:50.390
You gonna take your ball
and go home?

01:08:50.392 --> 01:08:52.225
No! Because
this is my place!

01:08:52.227 --> 01:08:55.493
Okay, now we are getting to
what this is all really about.

01:08:55.496 --> 01:08:57.296
Yeah, that's right.
I'm screwing this cat,

01:08:57.298 --> 01:08:58.631
you're holding its ears.

01:08:58.633 --> 01:09:00.466
I've been here 20 years,
you've been here two weeks!

01:09:00.468 --> 01:09:02.600
And you don't like that
very much, do you?

01:09:02.603 --> 01:09:04.604
Runny Blundale?

01:09:04.606 --> 01:09:07.407
- What'd you call me?
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

01:09:07.408 --> 01:09:08.541
Dewey Ray told me.

01:09:08.542 --> 01:09:10.310
Shit your pants at
8th grade basketball camp,

01:09:10.312 --> 01:09:11.577
and you've been known
as Runny ever since.

01:09:11.578 --> 01:09:12.743
Get out of my mall.

01:09:12.746 --> 01:09:15.448
Hey, is that... Is
that Runny Blundale?

01:09:15.450 --> 01:09:17.483
The guy who shit his pants
at 8th grade basketball camp?

01:09:17.484 --> 01:09:20.653
Sure is, you could tell
by the shit in his pants.

01:09:20.654 --> 01:09:22.854
Your daddy was the first
person to ever call me that.

01:09:22.856 --> 01:09:24.622
Is that so? That actually
makes a whole lot of sense.

01:09:24.625 --> 01:09:26.426
You ain't no better
than he was.

01:09:26.428 --> 01:09:28.631
Drunk, crashing into
her brother.

01:09:34.868 --> 01:09:36.336
What?

01:09:36.337 --> 01:09:39.907
Oh, yeah. Highway 35
is a pretty dangerous place.

01:09:54.087 --> 01:09:56.792
You know what? If you want the
job that bad, you can have it.

01:09:59.427 --> 01:10:00.696
I quit.

01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:12.840
Limo should be
here soon.

01:10:14.575 --> 01:10:17.310
It might have
had car trouble.

01:10:17.312 --> 01:10:21.012
Limos have a lot of carburetor
trouble, on account of their...

01:10:21.014 --> 01:10:22.314
You know, so long.

01:10:22.316 --> 01:10:23.949
Oh, is that right?

01:10:23.951 --> 01:10:24.951
Yeah.

01:10:24.953 --> 01:10:27.552
I'm gonna be
pretty upset

01:10:27.554 --> 01:10:29.221
if he's not here on account
of carburetor trouble,

01:10:29.223 --> 01:10:32.927
seeing as how he had all the roses
and puppy and all that stuff.

01:10:33.527 --> 01:10:35.293
I like puppies.

01:10:35.295 --> 01:10:37.465
I feed four
in my neighborhood.

01:10:41.169 --> 01:10:43.135
We could take
my car, so,

01:10:43.137 --> 01:10:46.372
you know, we don't miss
the hot air balloon ride

01:10:46.374 --> 01:10:48.006
- before it gets too late.
- Yeah.

01:10:48.008 --> 01:10:49.809
Yeah, he, uh...

01:10:49.811 --> 01:10:53.048
He called. We may not be able to
go up, because it's too cloudy.

01:11:08.762 --> 01:11:09.862
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
where are you going?

01:11:09.864 --> 01:11:12.567
Uh, we all like you
here, Delaney.

01:11:13.101 --> 01:11:14.367
I like you.

01:11:14.369 --> 01:11:16.135
I was just looking
for a...

01:11:16.137 --> 01:11:19.037
nice dinner with you,
and your sweet company,

01:11:19.039 --> 01:11:20.206
instead, I got lies.

01:11:20.208 --> 01:11:22.811
And if I wanted lies, I would
have called my ex-husband.

01:13:00.775 --> 01:13:02.207
Oh, excuse me,

01:13:02.209 --> 01:13:04.577
could you tell me where I might
find a chicken broth, please?

01:13:04.579 --> 01:13:06.845
Uh, I don't think
we have that.

01:13:06.847 --> 01:13:09.381
Well, I could substitute
vegetable broth.

01:13:09.383 --> 01:13:10.683
Nope, don't have
that, either.

01:13:10.685 --> 01:13:14.252
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:13:14.254 --> 01:13:16.956
We actually have both
those items, Walter.

01:13:16.958 --> 01:13:20.525
Sorry ma'am, they're both on aisle
three, both on the right side.

01:13:20.527 --> 01:13:22.063
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:13:22.829 --> 01:13:24.997
Ho, there, cowboy.

01:13:24.999 --> 01:13:26.698
If you ever don't know
where something is,

01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:28.870
just ask
one of us, okay?

01:13:30.871 --> 01:13:33.005
Walt.

01:13:33.007 --> 01:13:36.245
Come on, Walt. Can you turn
that frown upside down?

01:13:37.445 --> 01:13:39.010
Big sales day today.

01:13:39.012 --> 01:13:40.882
Need your head
in the game, buddy.

01:13:44.252 --> 01:13:46.952
Just put a big, dumb
smile on everything.

01:13:46.954 --> 01:13:48.688
Is that right,
Uncle Henry?

01:13:48.690 --> 01:13:49.822
Excuse me?

01:13:49.824 --> 01:13:52.094
Let's not deal with
the reality of anything.

01:13:54.161 --> 01:13:56.962
Well, I didn't know that Grumpy
McGrumperson was on the payrolls.

01:13:56.964 --> 01:13:58.967
I thought it was
my nephew Walt.

01:14:00.767 --> 01:14:02.937
He was an alcoholic,
Henry.

01:14:05.572 --> 01:14:08.674
My dad was an alcoholic.

01:14:08.676 --> 01:14:11.042
How about we all say
that together, can we?

01:14:11.044 --> 01:14:14.212
Chicken broth lady,
my dad was an alcoholic.

01:14:14.214 --> 01:14:16.782
My dad caused the accident,
and you all know it.

01:14:16.784 --> 01:14:19.085
It was a no-fault
accident, Walt,

01:14:19.087 --> 01:14:21.287
it said so right there
in the police report.

01:14:21.289 --> 01:14:22.724
Oh, is that right?

01:14:24.525 --> 01:14:28.426
How about you all paper the wall in
your house with that police report, huh?

01:14:28.428 --> 01:14:30.031
Maybe help you
sleep at night.

01:14:41.209 --> 01:14:45.610
So, catch me up since our last session.
What's new?

01:14:45.612 --> 01:14:48.514
Let's see, I had a nervous
breakdown in a grocery store,

01:14:48.516 --> 01:14:50.282
while wearing
a polka dot bow tie,

01:14:50.284 --> 01:14:51.317
I yelled at my family,

01:14:51.319 --> 01:14:52.885
and I think I might have
ruined a relationship

01:14:52.887 --> 01:14:54.886
with the most amazing
person I have ever met.

01:14:54.888 --> 01:14:58.457
Oh, oh, and I work
with the Devil.

01:14:58.459 --> 01:15:01.063
So what do you got for me?
Is there a pill for that?

01:15:03.397 --> 01:15:05.030
I'm gonna be honest,
Walter.

01:15:05.032 --> 01:15:07.899
I sense some hostility
toward me.

01:15:07.901 --> 01:15:09.068
Oh, no, no,
it's not just towards you.

01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:11.139
I'm equal opportunity,
I'm pissed at everybody.

01:15:12.373 --> 01:15:15.377
And why do you think
that is?

01:15:17.645 --> 01:15:18.879
Why am I mad?

01:15:19.513 --> 01:15:20.748
Uh-huh.

01:15:21.581 --> 01:15:23.384
Are you even
writing anything?

01:15:27.989 --> 01:15:30.088
I've had a really bad week.

01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:34.359
And my therapist says that I
still need to draw happy things

01:15:34.361 --> 01:15:35.594
on days like this.

01:15:35.596 --> 01:15:37.195
Okay, uh, I gotta be honest,

01:15:37.197 --> 01:15:39.698
I'm a little confused at
what's going on right here.

01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:41.466
Well, life can be very
confusing, Walter.

01:15:41.468 --> 01:15:43.903
No, I'm talking about
in this room, right now.

01:15:43.905 --> 01:15:46.372
Oh, you know, the burden
of consciousness.

01:15:46.374 --> 01:15:47.907
It's like...

01:15:47.909 --> 01:15:49.408
Can this really
be happening to me?

01:15:49.410 --> 01:15:51.377
I mean, everyone talked about it...

01:15:51.379 --> 01:15:53.445
...because, let's be
honest, our brain...

01:15:53.447 --> 01:15:55.648
Okay, okay, okay.

01:15:55.650 --> 01:15:58.149
I'm sitting here telling you that I
think I might have just lost a girl

01:15:58.151 --> 01:15:59.518
that I'm falling in love with,

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:03.855
and you are drawing
puppy dogs with sad eyes.

01:16:03.857 --> 01:16:06.527
And there it is.

01:16:07.628 --> 01:16:09.627
There what is?

01:16:09.629 --> 01:16:12.598
Textbook displacement,
Walter.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:15.400
You see, your frustration

01:16:15.402 --> 01:16:17.068
is not about me.

01:16:17.070 --> 01:16:21.108
It's about things not
going well with Ellie.

01:16:23.477 --> 01:16:26.278
Yes. I just said that.

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:27.747
My father!

01:16:27.749 --> 01:16:29.547
- My father!
- And that'll do it.

01:16:29.549 --> 01:16:31.018
My father!

01:16:32.954 --> 01:16:36.188
Holy mackerel.
Would you look at this?

01:16:36.190 --> 01:16:38.826
What, are you turning
this into a museum?

01:16:42.763 --> 01:16:45.096
- How you doing, Walt?
- Nah, I'm fine.

01:16:45.098 --> 01:16:46.431
What in the world
happened to these?

01:16:46.433 --> 01:16:50.435
Oh, I ruined 'em.
It was... It was stupid.

01:16:50.437 --> 01:16:52.606
I haven't worn 'em
since college, anyway.

01:16:53.708 --> 01:16:55.073
Wait, those are yours?

01:16:55.075 --> 01:16:57.945
Well, sure. Whose did
you think they were?

01:17:02.984 --> 01:17:05.152
Um...

01:17:06.286 --> 01:17:09.521
I'm really sorry about earlier.
I don't...

01:17:09.523 --> 01:17:11.093
No, don't apologize.

01:17:12.759 --> 01:17:16.063
I am not as naive
as you think I am, Walt.

01:17:17.531 --> 01:17:20.134
Your dad did have
a problem.

01:17:21.102 --> 01:17:22.971
But he was getting help.

01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:25.239
I knew that much.

01:17:28.543 --> 01:17:30.112
You have to forgive me.

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:42.887
Your dad was
90 days sober.

01:17:42.889 --> 01:17:45.127
And he was on his way
to give that to you.

01:17:51.731 --> 01:17:54.699
I guess I felt that
if I gave it to you,

01:17:54.701 --> 01:17:58.572
then I'd acknowledging that
he really did have a problem.

01:18:01.008 --> 01:18:02.644
I wasn't ready for that.

01:18:08.715 --> 01:18:11.352
It really
wasn't his fault, kiddo.

01:18:42.016 --> 01:18:43.485
Hey.

01:18:44.584 --> 01:18:45.953
Hey, man.

01:18:50.023 --> 01:18:52.393
- You okay?
- Me, I'm great.

01:18:55.596 --> 01:18:56.964
Did you talk to Dolores?

01:18:57.764 --> 01:19:00.334
Nah. You know what?
I didn't.

01:19:01.535 --> 01:19:03.138
It's better this way.

01:19:04.405 --> 01:19:06.838
And her nose has been
bleeding a lot, too.

01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:08.310
So that's kinda gross.

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:15.482
What are you doing here?

01:19:16.717 --> 01:19:18.353
Just got my last check.

01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:29.163
- Hey, Delaney.
- Yeah?

01:19:30.130 --> 01:19:31.398
Talk to Dolores, man.

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:34.369
Hey, Walt.

01:19:36.570 --> 01:19:37.672
You seen Ellie?

01:19:42.877 --> 01:19:44.079
Talk to her, man.

01:20:06.433 --> 01:20:08.600
<i>You've reached Ellie's
voicemail, leave a message.</i>

01:20:10.036 --> 01:20:11.403
Freakin' ass...

01:20:11.405 --> 01:20:15.040
Gas belching piece of
Detroit city bullshit.

01:20:18.379 --> 01:20:20.448
Every day,
it's something else.

01:20:21.715 --> 01:20:23.649
New roaders yesterday.

01:20:23.651 --> 01:20:27.188
Gas line day before.
And it's not the money.

01:20:28.155 --> 01:20:30.588
No, that's not
what I'm afraid of.

01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:33.425
What I'm afraid of is,
side of road, broke down,

01:20:33.427 --> 01:20:35.394
somewhere like
Gallup, New Mexico,

01:20:35.396 --> 01:20:38.029
sun beatin' down
on my black ass,

01:20:38.031 --> 01:20:40.399
or Drake, North Dakota,

01:20:40.401 --> 01:20:43.805
breaking my frozen knuckles
on a socket wrench.

01:20:45.172 --> 01:20:47.208
And from the inside
of the RV,

01:20:48.275 --> 01:20:51.310
I hear Vicky's
little squeal,

01:20:51.312 --> 01:20:53.778
nails on a
chalkboard voice,

01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:55.046
squeaky screaming,

01:20:55.048 --> 01:20:58.484
"Dewey! Dewey!

01:20:58.486 --> 01:21:01.052
"What is it
this time, Dewey?

01:21:01.054 --> 01:21:03.290
"And can you get
my water pills, Dewey?"

01:21:06.893 --> 01:21:08.163
I'm a man.

01:21:08.862 --> 01:21:10.395
Watch this.

01:21:18.539 --> 01:21:21.743
Vicky, I'm a man,
I'm keeping my job.

01:21:22.977 --> 01:21:25.810
Jimmy Lee, you can
keep your booth.

01:21:25.812 --> 01:21:29.249
You can pay me or not, I don't
care anymore, and I make the rules.

01:21:31.584 --> 01:21:33.318
Thank you.

01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:35.287
- Thank you, Dewey.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:21:35.289 --> 01:21:36.622
From the bottom
of my heart.

01:21:36.624 --> 01:21:38.827
- Hmm. Yeah, you're my man.
- Thank you.

01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:42.226
Blundale,

01:21:42.228 --> 01:21:44.195
you are a terrible stepson

01:21:44.197 --> 01:21:46.131
and an even worse
human being.

01:21:46.133 --> 01:21:49.001
And before you say anything
and do anything,

01:21:49.003 --> 01:21:51.903
you need to sit and think

01:21:51.905 --> 01:21:53.841
why so many people
don't like you.

01:21:55.709 --> 01:21:56.711
You're fired.

01:21:58.545 --> 01:22:01.079
You gonna fire me?
I quit.

01:22:01.081 --> 01:22:02.750
Well, either way,
you gone.

01:22:03.851 --> 01:22:06.784
Walt, I knew your daddy.

01:22:06.786 --> 01:22:08.155
Five, six years.

01:22:09.155 --> 01:22:10.491
How long did
you know him?

01:22:11.959 --> 01:22:13.161
My whole life.

01:22:14.661 --> 01:22:15.696
And who was he?

01:22:17.697 --> 01:22:20.334
You came here to find out
more about your dad, right?

01:22:21.067 --> 01:22:22.536
Who he was to all of us.

01:22:23.971 --> 01:22:25.406
Who was he to you?

01:22:28.843 --> 01:22:30.211
He was

01:22:31.544 --> 01:22:32.746
great to me.

01:22:34.748 --> 01:22:36.648
Okay, now.

01:22:36.650 --> 01:22:39.521
Are you going to live his life,
or are you gonna live your own?

01:22:43.257 --> 01:22:44.558
You gonna be
all right, boy.

01:22:45.392 --> 01:22:46.661
You're gonna be
all right.

01:23:24.030 --> 01:23:27.601
I know you're mad at me, but
just let me say a few things.

01:23:29.370 --> 01:23:32.270
I lied a lot,
and I shouldn't have.

01:23:32.272 --> 01:23:34.672
I wanted to impress you,
and I got nervous.

01:23:34.674 --> 01:23:37.242
And when that happens
to me, sometimes...

01:23:37.244 --> 01:23:39.681
Delaney, be quiet.
Listen.

01:23:40.947 --> 01:23:42.213
Now I don't care

01:23:42.215 --> 01:23:45.617
if you drive a sports car
or a scooter.

01:23:45.619 --> 01:23:48.857
What impresses me the most
is someone I can trust.

01:23:51.258 --> 01:23:53.591
I've realized something
about myself.

01:23:53.593 --> 01:23:56.028
I'm getting my nose
fixed back.

01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:58.497
I don't know if it's possible,
but I'm looking into it.

01:23:58.499 --> 01:24:01.736
And I'm not getting
my lopsided titties fixed.

01:24:03.204 --> 01:24:04.572
I like myself.

01:24:05.105 --> 01:24:06.508
You should, too.

01:24:09.642 --> 01:24:10.645
Good.

01:24:11.312 --> 01:24:13.581
Now, say you're sorry.

01:24:15.014 --> 01:24:16.316
I am sorry.

01:24:18.319 --> 01:24:19.786
Good. I'll pick you up
at 7:00.

01:24:50.116 --> 01:24:51.882
How's my favorite niece?

01:24:53.053 --> 01:24:54.489
Hey.

01:24:55.556 --> 01:24:57.989
You need to know
something about Walt.

01:24:57.991 --> 01:24:59.791
I'm really not in the mood.

01:24:59.793 --> 01:25:01.426
Okay? I already know
how you feel about him.

01:25:01.428 --> 01:25:03.228
I can't stand him.

01:25:03.230 --> 01:25:04.766
And for once,
it's not about that.

01:25:07.034 --> 01:25:08.870
Walt's dad
wasn't drunk, Ellie.

01:25:10.971 --> 01:25:12.637
It was a wet night.

01:25:12.639 --> 01:25:14.107
The wreck was
no one's fault.

01:25:17.444 --> 01:25:18.913
I shouldn't have said
what I did.

01:25:59.119 --> 01:26:01.522
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:26:10.798 --> 01:26:12.867
I have to tell you something
about the accident.

01:26:15.535 --> 01:26:17.404
- Blundale told me...
- No.

01:26:18.405 --> 01:26:19.807
I already know.

01:26:21.208 --> 01:26:22.844
Why didn't you tell me?

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:28.715
I don't know.

01:26:36.022 --> 01:26:37.525
I've never been here.

01:26:40.828 --> 01:26:45.165
I took every road possible
to avoid being here.

01:26:48.168 --> 01:26:51.002
Honest to God,
how do you...

01:26:51.004 --> 01:26:53.508
How do you let yourself
feel these things

01:26:54.407 --> 01:26:56.143
and not let it
tear you apart?

01:27:00.347 --> 01:27:03.851
Hey, I genuinely
have no idea.
