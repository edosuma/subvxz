00:03.666 --> 00:04.333
HEY, DUDE.

00:04.400 --> 00:06.100
WHAT'S IN THE BAG?

00:06.166 --> 00:07.233
DEAD MICE.

00:07.300 --> 00:08.833
GET THAT AWAY FROM ME.

00:08.900 --> 00:11.166
( making spooky sounds )

00:11.233 --> 00:12.833
I'M NOT PLAYING
WITH YOU.

00:12.900 --> 00:14.900
THOSE THINGS CARRY
DISEASES AND GERMS

00:14.966 --> 00:16.733
AND THEY HAVE BEADY LITTLE EYES.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.666
THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH YOU WHITE‐COLLAR TYPES.

00:19.733 --> 00:21.966
YOUR PLUSH OFFICES
AND YOUR FANCY E‐MAIL

00:22.033 --> 00:23.066

I GOT IT. WATCH THIS.

01:14.273 --> 01:15.540
ALL RIGHT NOW.

01:15.606 --> 01:16.873
NEXT TIME, TRY THIS

01:16.940 --> 01:19.840
WITH SOME CHICKEN,
MASHED POTATOES AND GRAVY.

01:19.906 --> 01:21.940
YEAH, MY TIMING'S OFF.

01:22.006 --> 01:24.140
OBIE'S GOT ME
ALL UPSET.

01:24.206 --> 01:26.506
HE SEEMS SCARED OF MY MAKEUP.

01:26.573 --> 01:28.273
WHAT MAKEUP?

01:29.806 --> 01:31.940
HOW DID YOU GET THIS GIG?

01:32.006 --> 01:34.840
I WAS AUDITIONING FOR THE PART
IN <i>DEATH OF A SALESMAN.</i>

01:34.906 --> 01:36.173
DIDN'T GET THE PART

01:36.240 --> 01:39.040
BUT THE DIRECTOR THOUGHT
I'D MAKE A TERRIFIC CLOWN

01:39.106 --> 01:40.873
FOR HIS KID'S MARDI GRAS PARTY.

01:40.940 --> 01:45.440
WELL, HONEY, I'M SURE
YOU'LL MAKE ONE FINE FOOL.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.173
ANYWAY, I JUST CAN'T WAIT

01:47.240 --> 01:48.573
UNTIL KHADIJAH
GETS HOME

01:48.640 --> 01:50.773
SO SHE CAN HELP ME WRITE
SOME JOKES.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.606
I HOPE SHE GETS HOME SOON TOO.

01:52.673 --> 01:55.006
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
KICKING IT WITH A CLOWN

01:55.073 --> 01:56.906
AND SYNCLAIRE'S BUSY JUGGLING.

01:56.973 --> 01:58.306

COMES OUT NEXT WEEK.

02:05.613 --> 02:07.113
CHECK IT OUT, PEOPLE.

02:07.180 --> 02:08.880
THE NEXT ISSUE OF <i>FLAVOR</i>

02:08.946 --> 02:12.113
WILL CONTAIN A FREE
SCRATCH 'N' SNIFF POSTER

02:12.180 --> 02:14.546
OF LAURENCE FISHBURNE
AS OTHELLO.

02:14.613 --> 02:15.913
THAT'LL GIVE <i>SAVOR</i>

02:15.980 --> 02:17.746
A KICK IN ITS
BIG‐MONEY ASS.

02:17.813 --> 02:19.980
HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO AFFORD THAT?

02:20.046 --> 02:22.380
I'M MOONLIGHTING
AS A SECURITY GUARD

02:22.446 --> 02:25.213
FROM 10:00 AT NIGHT
TO 2:00 IN THE MORNING

02:25.280 --> 02:26.480
STARTING TOMORROW.

02:26.546 --> 02:28.680
THAT SOUNDS DANGEROUS.

02:28.746 --> 02:31.213
PLEASE. IT'S AT
A RETIREMENT HOME.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.580
I'LL BE ARMED
WITH A BOTTLE OF ESTROGEN PILLS

02:34.646 --> 02:36.746
AND A TUBE OF DENTURE CREAM.

02:36.813 --> 02:37.746
GREAT.

02:37.813 --> 02:39.546
IF A THUG ATTACKS HER

02:39.613 --> 02:42.546
SHE CAN GLUE HIS MOUTH SHUT
AND GIVE HIM BREASTS.

02:42.613 --> 02:43.713
HAS ANYBODY SEEN..?

02:43.780 --> 02:44.813
CLOWN.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.480
OBIE, WAIT.

02:46.546 --> 02:47.680
OBIE!

02:47.746 --> 02:50.080
COMING TO GET YOU.

02:50.146 --> 02:52.146
OVERTON

02:52.213 --> 02:54.513
WHY'D YOU RUN AWAY FROM ME?

02:54.580 --> 02:59.813
IT'S MY, UM, SECRET SHAME,
MY LITTLE NONDAIRY TOPPING.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.220
EVER SINCE I CAN REMEMBER

03:02.286 --> 03:05.120
I'VE BEEN UNEASY
AROUND CLOWNS.

03:05.186 --> 03:08.953
OH, YOU NEVER TOLD ME
YOU HAD BOZOPHOBIA.

03:09.020 --> 03:13.020
IT'S KIND OF WHY
I CALL IT MY SECRET SHAME.

03:13.086 --> 03:14.353
YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:14.420 --> 03:15.720
IT'S HIGH TIME

03:15.786 --> 03:20.220
I GET THIS BRIGHTLY COLORED
MONKEY OFF MY BACK.

03:22.220 --> 03:27.320
BUT FIRST I THINK I'M GOING
TO TAKE A LITTLE STROLL.

03:27.386 --> 03:29.053
WALLS CLOSING IN.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.453
MUST GET AIR.

03:38.753 --> 03:40.186
HEY, REGINE, COME HERE.

03:40.253 --> 03:41.620
GIVE ME A PUSH.

03:46.853 --> 03:49.153
I WAS SOUND ASLEEP

03:49.220 --> 03:51.520
WHEN SUDDENLY I'M AWAKENED

03:51.586 --> 03:55.353
BY THE SOUND
OF SOMEONE'S MIND SNAPPING.

03:55.420 --> 03:57.253
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:57.320 --> 04:00.593
WELL, I WAS GOING
OVER SYNCLAIRE'S
KNOCK‐KNOCK JOKES

04:00.660 --> 04:02.593
AND THEN IT HIT ME.

04:02.660 --> 04:06.626
WHAT THIS ROOM NEEDS IS
A MULTIPURPOSE ACTIVITY CIRCLE.

04:06.693 --> 04:08.693
SEE, YOU SIT HERE
TO WATCH TV

04:08.760 --> 04:12.793
BUT YOU SLIDE OVER HERE TO WORK

04:12.860 --> 04:18.093
AND EVERY SEAT HAS
A GOOD VIEW OF THE RUG.

04:18.160 --> 04:21.493
KHADIJAH, YOU HAVEN'T SLEPT
A WINK IN WEEKS...

04:21.560 --> 04:23.193
WHAT'S THIS?

04:23.260 --> 04:27.560
A MULTIPURPOSE ACTIVITY CIRCLE.

04:27.626 --> 04:29.493
OH, SNAP.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.726
YOU CAN SEE THE RUG
FROM ANYWHERE.

04:32.793 --> 04:35.793
KHADIJAH, THIS IS MORE
THAN JUST ABOUT <i>FLAVOR.</i>

04:35.859 --> 04:38.459
IT'S ABOUT SCOOTER
FINDING ANOTHER WOMAN

04:38.526 --> 04:39.726
ISN'T IT?

04:41.260 --> 04:42.593
WHAT?

04:42.660 --> 04:46.460
DAMN, SYNCLAIRE, THAT'S
THE LAST TIME I DISH WITH YOU.

04:46.526 --> 04:49.193
I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE.

04:49.260 --> 04:51.026
YOU'LL BE BACK.

04:51.093 --> 04:54.193
HE'S ALLOWED TO HAVE A LIFE.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.693
HERE ARE YOUR
KNOCK‐KNOCK JOKES.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.193
OKAY.

04:58.260 --> 04:59.526
"KNOCK KNOCK.

04:59.593 --> 05:00.866
"WHO'S THERE?

05:00.933 --> 05:01.866

05:01.933 --> 05:03.333
"DIESEL WHO?

05:03.400 --> 05:08.166
DIESEL MAKE YOU LAUGH
IF YOU AREN'T TOO SMART."

05:08.233 --> 05:09.700
THAT IS GOOD.

05:09.766 --> 05:11.233
THAT IS GOOD.

05:11.300 --> 05:13.833
KHADIJAH, HONEY...

05:13.900 --> 05:16.866
AS YOUR FRIEND...

05:16.933 --> 05:20.533
I THINK YOU NEED THERAPY.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.700
WELL, THAT'S GOOD ADVICE

05:22.766 --> 05:27.000
FROM SOMEBODY WHO'S BAKING
HER HEAD WHILE SHE SLEEPS.

05:27.066 --> 05:30.533
I WAS TALKING
ABOUT AROMATHERAPY.

05:30.600 --> 05:34.033
THAT'S HOW I STAY SO CENTERED.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.433
UNGRATEFUL.

05:36.500 --> 05:37.766
"KNOCK KNOCK.

05:43.066 --> 05:45.766
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD YODEL."

05:48.733 --> 05:51.266
MAYBE SHE SHOULD STAY WOUND UP.

I HAVE THE SOLUTION

05:59.766 --> 06:01.873
TO YOUR CLOWN PHOBIA.

06:01.940 --> 06:03.606
ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS INTRODUCE YOU

06:03.673 --> 06:06.273
TO CLOWN‐RELATED
ITEMS ONE AT A TIME

06:06.340 --> 06:08.573
AND YOU SHOULD
BE DESENSITIZED.

06:08.640 --> 06:09.973
ALL RIGHTY THEN.

06:10.040 --> 06:11.373
HERE WE GO.

06:13.573 --> 06:15.573

JUST DON'T SQUEAK IT.

06:26.573 --> 06:28.506

06:28.573 --> 06:29.973
I HOPE THAT'S KHADIJAH.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.406
SHE WAS OUT ALL NIGHT.

06:31.473 --> 06:34.240
I'VE BEEN ALL OVER BROOKLYN
TEARING DOWN

06:34.306 --> 06:35.273
THESE SAVOR ADS.

06:35.340 --> 06:36.706
AND LOOK AT THIS.

06:40.540 --> 06:44.506
TWO COPS AND A BUS DRIVER CHASED
ME FOR SIX BLOCKS FOR THIS

06:44.573 --> 06:45.906
BUT I SHOOK 'EM.

06:47.973 --> 06:48.840
YOU KNOW WHAT I SAW?

06:48.906 --> 06:50.806
I JUST SAW SOME CRAZY NUT CASE

06:50.873 --> 06:52.873
DRAGGING A BIG BUS AD
DOWN THE...

06:54.806 --> 06:56.240
( squeaks )

06:56.306 --> 06:57.240
CLOWN.

06:57.306 --> 06:58.473
GIVE ME THAT.

06:58.540 --> 06:59.706
GIVE ME THAT.

06:59.773 --> 07:00.946
GIVE ME THAT.

07:01.013 --> 07:03.080
KHADIJAH,
SIT DOWN, BABY.

07:03.146 --> 07:04.946
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOU?

07:05.013 --> 07:06.913
WELL, WHAT'S NOT
GOING ON?

07:06.980 --> 07:08.580
SOME BIG CORPORATION

07:08.646 --> 07:11.246
IS TRYING TO RUN ME
OUT OF BUSINESS

07:11.313 --> 07:12.613
WITH MY OWN IDEA.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.080
I'M HOLDING DOWN TWO JOBS
AND PAYING OFF FIVE LOANS.

07:16.146 --> 07:19.080
AND DAMN IT IF MY SHINSPLINTS
AIN'T ACTING UP

07:19.146 --> 07:20.613
FROM DUCKING THE COPS.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.780
KHADIJAH,
YOU CAN HANDLE THIS.

07:22.846 --> 07:24.746
THAT'S TRUE.
YOU ALWAYS DO.

07:24.813 --> 07:27.613
KHADIJAH, WHEN TIMES ARE TOUGH
AND I'M FEELING BLUE

07:27.680 --> 07:32.213
THREE WORDS OF WISDOM,
"WOO WOO WOO."

07:32.280 --> 07:33.913
IT'S A SAD DAY

07:33.980 --> 07:39.213
WHEN SYNCLAIRE HAS
THE DEEPEST THING TO SAY.

07:39.280 --> 07:42.280
I'M THE DEEPEST.

07:44.046 --> 07:45.380
HI, MA?

07:45.446 --> 07:47.680
OH, I'M FINE.

07:47.746 --> 07:50.580
BUT EVERYBODY AROUND HERE
IS ACTING LIKE I'M LOSING IT

07:50.646 --> 07:54.146
JUST BECAUSE I SURFED DOWN
THE SUBWAY STEPS ON A BUS AD

07:54.213 --> 07:57.046
AND HID BEHIND
THIS BLIND CONGO PLAYER

07:57.113 --> 07:59.113
TILL THE HEAT WAS OFF.

08:01.120 --> 08:04.153
I'VE BEEN UNDER A LOT
OF PRESSURE LATELY, MA.

08:04.220 --> 08:06.920
PAY WHO A VISIT?

08:06.986 --> 08:08.786
A WHAT?

08:08.853 --> 08:10.153
KHADIJAH?

08:13.420 --> 08:15.420
THAT'S ME.

08:15.486 --> 08:17.820
HI. I'M JESSICA BRYCE.

08:17.886 --> 08:19.520
READY?

08:19.586 --> 08:20.853
ALL RIGHT.

08:20.920 --> 08:22.186
STRAP ME DOWN

08:22.253 --> 08:24.120
AND CLAMP ON
THOSE ELECTRODES.

08:24.186 --> 08:25.453
I WAS HOPING

08:25.520 --> 08:27.720
WE COULD JUST CHAT
A LITTLE BIT

08:27.786 --> 08:29.953
BUT IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU'RE INTO

08:30.020 --> 08:31.986
I'LL CRANK UP
THE GENERATOR.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.453
LET'S GET STARTED.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.453
( laughing )

08:36.520 --> 08:40.153
OH, DAMN,
WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

08:41.686 --> 08:43.186
COME ON.

08:57.186 --> 08:58.120
SO, KHADIJAH

08:58.186 --> 08:59.353
WHAT BRINGS
YOU HERE?

08:59.420 --> 09:01.360
MY MOTHER.

09:01.426 --> 09:02.493
MADE ME PROMISE I WOULD COME.

09:02.560 --> 09:05.126
BUT YOU REALLY DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE COMING.

09:05.193 --> 09:06.560
LOOK, NO OFFENSE, DOC

09:06.626 --> 09:08.793
BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT
PSYCHOTHERAPY

09:08.860 --> 09:11.626
WAS FOR BOURGIE PEOPLE
WITH MONEY TO BURN.

09:11.693 --> 09:13.460
I MEAN, IF I HAVE A PROBLEM

09:13.526 --> 09:16.560
I USUALLY JUST GO TO CHURCH,
GET ME SOME JESUS

09:16.626 --> 09:19.593
AND I'M COOL.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.026
THAT IS A POPULAR CHOICE

09:21.093 --> 09:23.793
BUT GOD MUST HAVE MADE
THERAPISTS FOR A REASON.

09:23.860 --> 09:25.593
WELL, YEAH, BUT SEE,
I'M THE ONE

09:25.660 --> 09:27.693
WHO HELPS PEOPLE
WITH THEIR PROBLEMS.

09:27.760 --> 09:31.093
MAYBE I SHOULD TRY TALKING
TO MYSELF.

09:31.160 --> 09:33.893
ALWAYS WORKS FOR SYNCLAIRE.

09:33.960 --> 09:35.326
SYNCLAIRE?

09:35.393 --> 09:37.760
MY COUSIN.

09:37.826 --> 09:41.060
NOW THAT'S SOMEBODY
WHO COULD USE SOME COUCH TIME.

09:41.126 --> 09:43.393
OR MY ROOMMATE, REGINE.

09:43.460 --> 09:45.860
GIRL, SHE'S STILL WAITING
TO EXHALE.

09:45.926 --> 09:48.160
OR MAX, THAT'S MY BEST FRIEND...

09:48.226 --> 09:49.526
KHADIJAH,
EXCUSE ME.

09:49.593 --> 09:51.226
MAY I MAKE A SUGGESTION?

09:51.293 --> 09:54.560
WHY DON'T WE SPEND YOUR DIME
TALKING ABOUT YOU?

09:54.626 --> 09:56.693
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

09:56.760 --> 09:58.593
LET'S TALK ABOUT ME.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.933
GO AHEAD.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.400
OKAY, GIVE ME, UM...
A TYPICAL KHADIJAH DAY

10:07.466 --> 10:09.000
LIKE YESTERDAY.

10:09.066 --> 10:10.733
OH, OKAY.
WELL, LET'S SEE.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.600
I USUALLY GET UP
ABOUT 5:30 IN THE MORNING

10:13.666 --> 10:16.533
BUT I GOT HOME LATE
FROM MY SECOND JOB

10:16.600 --> 10:19.566
SO I LOUNGED AROUND IN BED
FOR ABOUT...

10:19.633 --> 10:20.766
MMM...

10:20.833 --> 10:22.166
FIVE MINUTES.

10:22.233 --> 10:23.933
A LITTLE "YOU" TIME.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.366
RIGHT. SO THEN I WENT

10:25.433 --> 10:26.833
TO MY OFFICE.

10:26.900 --> 10:28.300
I DID ALL THE EDITING.

10:28.366 --> 10:31.033
I GOT SYNCLAIRE'S BRAIDS
OUT THE FAX MACHINE.

10:31.100 --> 10:33.766
WENT HOME, LISTENED TO MAX
WHINE ABOUT HER JOB

10:33.833 --> 10:35.833
LISTENED TO REGINE
BRAG ABOUT HERS

10:35.900 --> 10:37.533
WENT TO THE RETIREMENT HOME

10:37.600 --> 10:40.000
BACK TO MY HOUSE
FOR A CHANGE OF DRAWERS

10:40.066 --> 10:41.333
AND THAT'S IT.

10:41.400 --> 10:44.300
YOU MUST BE
EXHAUSTED.

10:44.366 --> 10:45.933
NOT AT ALL.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.500
WORKING GIVES ME ENERGY.

10:47.566 --> 10:49.000
SO EVERYTHING'S COOL.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.000
MAD COOL.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.866
EXCEPT THAT THIS
BIG MAGAZINE

10:51.933 --> 10:53.166
IS COMING OUT TODAY

10:53.233 --> 10:55.900
AND THEY TRYING TO RUN
ME OUT OF BUSINESS.

10:55.966 --> 10:58.200
AND MY EX‐FIANCE IS...

10:58.266 --> 11:01.606
WELL, HE'S SEEING SOMEBODY ELSE.

11:01.673 --> 11:02.840
BUT I CAN HANDLE THAT.

11:02.906 --> 11:04.573
SO...

11:04.640 --> 11:07.140
I CAN TELL MY MOM
I'M OKAY, RIGHT?

11:12.340 --> 11:15.740
JUMP IN
ANY TIME, DOC.

11:15.806 --> 11:18.740
FRANKLY, I DO SEE SIGNS
OF ANXIETY.

11:21.173 --> 11:24.140
BUT WHAT I'M REALLY CONCERNED
ABOUT IS DEPRESSION.

11:24.206 --> 11:26.873
DEPRESSION?

11:26.940 --> 11:31.006
NOW, THAT'S WHEN YOU SIT AROUND
ALL DAY EATING COOKIE DOUGH

11:31.073 --> 11:35.106
AND CRYING AT UNITED NEGRO
COLLEGE FUND COMMERCIALS.

11:35.173 --> 11:36.473
NO, THAT'S NOT ME.

11:36.540 --> 11:38.373
THERE'S MORE
THAN ONE KIND

11:38.440 --> 11:40.973
OF DEPRESSION, KHADIJAH.

11:41.040 --> 11:44.640
BIPOLAR DEPRESSION CAN BE THE
OPPOSITE FROM WHAT YOU'D EXPECT.

11:44.706 --> 11:45.773
YOU'RE ON A HIGH.

11:45.840 --> 11:46.840
YOU CAN'T SLEEP.

11:46.906 --> 11:48.140
YOU HAVE
MOOD SWINGS

11:48.206 --> 11:51.273
AND, EVENTUALLY, YOU CRASH.

11:51.340 --> 11:53.073
WHATEVER.

11:53.140 --> 11:54.906
LOOK, THE POINT IS

11:54.973 --> 11:57.440
I HAVE MY PROBLEMS
UNDER CONTROL.

11:57.506 --> 11:59.606
OKAY?

11:59.673 --> 12:01.446
WHAT DO I HAVE
TO BE DEPRESSED ABOUT?

12:01.513 --> 12:03.880
I'M NOT DEPRESSED.

12:03.946 --> 12:07.146
I'M HAPPY.

12:07.213 --> 12:11.713
( crying ):
I'M THE HAPPIEST PERSON I KNOW.

12:19.413 --> 12:20.813
WHAT IS THIS?

12:20.880 --> 12:25.046
I HAVEN'T CRIED SINCE
MUFASA DIED IN <i>LION KING.</i>

12:25.113 --> 12:28.580
DAMN THOSE HYENAS!

12:28.646 --> 12:31.713
( crying )

12:31.780 --> 12:34.513
I THINK THIS IS ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE.

12:34.580 --> 12:36.680
LOOK, IT'S COOL, DOC, OKAY?

12:36.746 --> 12:39.913
I GOT EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL, ALL RIGHT?

12:39.980 --> 12:41.913
I THINK I'M
GOING TO BE

12:41.980 --> 12:44.880
GETTING BACK
TO WORK NOW.

12:44.946 --> 12:49.513
LISTEN, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TELL
ANYBODY I WAS CRYING, RIGHT?

12:49.580 --> 12:53.113
YOUR SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME.

12:53.180 --> 12:54.946
KHADIJAH
OKAY.

12:55.013 --> 12:56.246
YOUR HAIR'S CROOKED.

13:00.520 --> 13:01.786
PERFECT.

13:04.486 --> 13:09.253
SO, HOW WAS "LUNCH"?

13:09.320 --> 13:10.553
FINE. WHY?

13:10.620 --> 13:14.853
DO WE FEEL BETTER
NOW THAT WE'VE "EATEN"?

13:17.220 --> 13:21.120
SYNCLAIRE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
"HELL" YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.

13:21.186 --> 13:25.386
I STUMBLED ONTO DR. BRYCE'S CARD
IN THE BACK OF YOUR DESK DRAWER

13:25.453 --> 13:27.586
IN AN ENVELOPE
UNDER SOME PAPERS.

13:27.653 --> 13:30.120
MAYBE YOU WANTED
SOMEBODY TO FIND IT.

13:30.186 --> 13:33.020
AND YOU TOLD EVERYONE?

13:33.086 --> 13:34.453
I ANNOUNCED TO EVERYONE

13:34.520 --> 13:36.886
THAT YOU ARE UNDER
A PSYCHIATRIST'S CARE

13:36.953 --> 13:38.520
AND NO ONE
WAS TO TREAT YOU

13:38.586 --> 13:41.253
AS IF ANYTHING WAS
TERRIBLY, TERRIBLY WRONG.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.253
EVERYBODY IS TREATING ME
LIKE I'M A MENTAL PATIENT.

13:44.320 --> 13:47.986
YOU ARE A MENTAL PATIENT.

13:48.053 --> 13:50.053
( humming )

13:57.286 --> 13:58.520
GOD...

14:01.893 --> 14:04.460
YOU SHOULD'VE COME TO ME.

14:04.526 --> 14:05.626
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

14:05.693 --> 14:06.626
ANXIETY?

14:06.693 --> 14:08.193
LOW SELF‐ESTEEM?

14:08.260 --> 14:10.726
OBSESSIVE THOUGHTS
OF RANDOM ARSON?

14:10.793 --> 14:12.793
I'VE BEEN THERE, GIRL.

14:15.526 --> 14:17.293
OH, KHADIJAH,
WHEN I FIRST HEARD

14:17.360 --> 14:19.260
THAT YOU WERE SEEING A THERAPIST

14:19.326 --> 14:21.560
WELL, I WAS GOING
TO DENY KNOWING YOU.

14:21.626 --> 14:22.726
BUT I JUST READ

14:22.793 --> 14:25.726
IN ESSENCE
THAT PSYCHOTHERAPY IS IN.

14:25.793 --> 14:29.360
MMM. IT'S A SHAME
I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.

14:29.426 --> 14:32.360
LISTEN TO Y'ALL YAMMERING
ABOUT SOMETHING

14:32.426 --> 14:35.226
WHEN YOU KNOW NOTHING!

14:35.293 --> 14:39.893
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
TO A THERAPIST?!

14:39.960 --> 14:40.960
PLEASE.

14:41.026 --> 14:42.626
I'VE GOT THIS OUTFIT, GIRL.

14:42.693 --> 14:44.160
I AM TRENDY ENOUGH.

14:47.526 --> 14:49.193
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

14:49.260 --> 14:51.093
WHEN I WAS
AT EVANS AND BELL

14:51.160 --> 14:54.793
THEY MADE EVERY ATTORNEY
SPEND AN HOUR WITH THIS GUY

14:54.860 --> 14:58.193
WHO CALLED HIMSELF
A PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOLOGIST.

14:58.260 --> 15:00.033
YOU NEVER
TOLD ME THAT.

15:00.100 --> 15:03.066
BECAUSE THE MAN SAID NOTHING
WORTH REPEATING.

15:03.133 --> 15:04.866
OH, SURE,
HE WENT ON AND ON

15:04.933 --> 15:07.466
ABOUT HOW I HAD
INAPPROPRIATE HOSTILITY

15:07.533 --> 15:11.333
AND DIFFICULTY DEALING WITH MEN
AND THAT I WAS IN DENIAL.

15:11.400 --> 15:14.333
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
SUCH CRAP IN YOUR LIFE?

15:15.733 --> 15:17.133
WHAT ARE YOU
ALL DOING?

15:17.200 --> 15:19.366
HELPING OBIE
GET OVER HIS PHOBIA

15:19.433 --> 15:22.033
BY ASSOCIATING A GOOD EXPERIENCE
WITH A BAD ONE.

15:22.100 --> 15:23.033
( honking )

15:23.100 --> 15:23.900
CLOWN!

15:23.966 --> 15:25.033
( yells )

15:25.100 --> 15:26.866
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

15:26.933 --> 15:28.033
SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN.

15:28.100 --> 15:30.666
OVERTON, IF YOU
DON'T LIKE CLOWNS

15:30.733 --> 15:33.100
WHY ARE YOU HANGING
WITH KYLE?

15:33.166 --> 15:35.833
MAXINE, I AM TRYING
TO HELP A PERSON.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.333
YOU REMEMBER PEOPLE.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.766
THEY'RE THE ONES
WITH THE TORCHES

15:39.833 --> 15:42.233
WHO CHASED YOU
OUT OF THE CASTLE.

15:45.600 --> 15:49.166
ALL RIGHTY, THEN LET US BEGIN.

15:49.233 --> 15:51.533
( funky hip‐hop music playing )

15:56.000 --> 15:57.933
( circus music playing )

15:59.500 --> 16:01.606
( funky music playing )

16:03.540 --> 16:04.806
( circus music playing )

16:04.873 --> 16:06.340
( funky music playing )

16:10.240 --> 16:12.073
( circus music playing )

16:12.140 --> 16:14.573
( yelling )

16:14.640 --> 16:17.973
TOO MUCH DATA.

16:18.040 --> 16:20.506
OVERTON, WHERE DID THIS
STUPID FEAR COME FROM?

16:20.573 --> 16:21.806
HOW'D IT GET STARTED?

16:21.873 --> 16:26.040
ALL GOES BACK TO WHEN I WAS
JUST A LITTLE SHAVER

16:26.106 --> 16:28.040
AND MA TOOK KYLE AND I

16:28.106 --> 16:31.573
TO THE DING‐A‐DONG CIRCUS
IN ASHTUBULA.

16:33.406 --> 16:35.873
AND A FIRE FIGHTER CLOWN

16:35.940 --> 16:39.273
ASKED ME TO RIDE
ON THE TINY HOOK AND LADDER.

16:40.406 --> 16:41.540
Kyle:
AND, UM...

16:41.606 --> 16:43.240
EVERYTHING WAS COOL

16:43.306 --> 16:45.806
UNTIL IT SPUN
OUT OF CONTROL

16:45.873 --> 16:48.773
AND HE WENT
FLYING HEADFIRST

16:48.840 --> 16:52.473
INTO THE BACK END
OF LARGE THE ELEPHANT.

16:54.840 --> 17:00.613
LITERALLY SCARED THE SH‐TRAW
OUT OF THE POOR BEAST.

17:00.680 --> 17:03.546
DAMN NEAR BURIED ALIVE.

17:03.613 --> 17:07.313
AND ALTHOUGH
I COULD BREATHE

17:07.380 --> 17:11.113
LORD KNOWS
I WISHED I COULDN'T.

17:12.613 --> 17:16.380
BUT THE IMAGE THAT'S
FOREVER BURNED INTO MY BRAIN

17:16.445 --> 17:21.146
IS THE LOOKS ON THE FACES
OF THE 37 CLOWNS

17:21.213 --> 17:24.813
TRYING TO DIG ME OUT
WITH THEIR TINY LITTLE SHOVELS

17:24.880 --> 17:27.146
JUST DIGGING, DIGGING.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.480
MAMA, COME HOLD ME.

17:28.546 --> 17:30.280
YES, BABY, YES, BABY.

17:30.346 --> 17:31.780
( knocking )

17:31.846 --> 17:33.446
OH, HUSH NOW.

17:33.513 --> 17:34.980
( knocking continues )

17:35.046 --> 17:37.746
HELLO, ENCHANTRESS.

17:37.813 --> 17:39.680
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:39.746 --> 17:41.280
STILL POUTY?

17:44.580 --> 17:46.346
KHADIJAH,
CAME RIGHT OVER

17:46.413 --> 17:48.746
WITH THE PREMIER ISSUE OF <i>SAVOR.</i>

17:48.813 --> 17:50.346
YOU OWE ME 3.50.

17:52.880 --> 17:57.080
"KID VERSUS PLAY:
WHO'S COOLER?"

17:57.146 --> 18:03.620
"DREAM GANGSTA TEAM:
SNOOP DOGGY DOGG
AND BETTE MIDLER"?

18:03.686 --> 18:05.353
THIS IS WEAK!

18:05.420 --> 18:07.186
LISTEN HERE WHAT IT SAYS

18:07.253 --> 18:08.320
IN <i>MEDIA DAILY.</i>

18:08.386 --> 18:10.153
"SAVOR IS ABOUT AS FRESH

18:10.220 --> 18:12.186
"AS A GAS STATION REST ROOM.

18:12.253 --> 18:15.286
"INSTEAD, READERS SHOULD
LOOK TO <i>FLAVOR</i>

18:15.353 --> 18:18.920
"THE LEADING‐EDGE MAGAZINE

18:20.653 --> 18:23.986
DAH!

18:24.053 --> 18:25.553
HOORAY!

18:25.620 --> 18:26.886
HOORAY!

18:26.953 --> 18:29.186
COME NOW!

18:29.253 --> 18:32.486
SHIMMY WITH HAPPINESS.

18:37.486 --> 18:39.453
KHADIJAH, COME IN.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.420
I DON'T HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT
OR ANYTHING.

18:41.486 --> 18:42.353
OH, THAT'S OKAY.

18:42.420 --> 18:43.820
I HAVE TIME.

18:43.886 --> 18:47.153
MY PROCRASTINATION WORKSHOP
USUALLY STARTS A LITTLE LATE.

18:47.220 --> 18:52.153
WELL, I JUST CAME
BY TO APOLOGIZE.

18:52.220 --> 18:54.920
I WAS KINDA BUGGIN'
WHEN I WAS HERE BEFORE

18:54.986 --> 18:58.686
AND I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
I'M FEELING A LOT BETTER.

19:05.326 --> 19:07.493
I JUST DON'T GET IT.

19:08.993 --> 19:11.360
I MEAN, EVERYTHING IS COOL
AT WORK.

19:11.426 --> 19:14.526
I SHOULD BE FEELING MUCH BETTER,
BUT I'M NOT.

19:14.593 --> 19:16.393
I'M GLAD.

19:16.460 --> 19:19.326
SURE, YOU GLAD.

19:19.393 --> 19:22.993
THAT'S HOW YOU GET
REPEAT BUSINESS.

19:23.060 --> 19:24.493
NO. IT'S A SIGN

19:24.560 --> 19:27.593
THAT THE DEFENSES
YOU WORKED SO HARD TO BUILD UP

19:27.660 --> 19:28.960
ARE FINALLY CRUMBLING.

19:29.026 --> 19:31.193
YOU MIGHT BE LOSING
SOME COOL POINTS

19:31.260 --> 19:33.160
BUT YOU'RE GETTING TO THE REAL.

19:33.226 --> 19:36.260
I BEEN THINKING
ABOUT HOW MUCH I'VE GIVEN UP

19:36.326 --> 19:38.126
TO FOCUS ON THIS MAGAZINE‐‐

19:38.193 --> 19:40.760
TIME AWAY
FROM MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS

19:40.826 --> 19:43.226
AND A FEW FINE MEN.

19:43.293 --> 19:45.760
GIRL, I MEAN REAL FINE.

19:45.826 --> 19:47.360
AND LATELY

19:47.426 --> 19:50.060
I HAVEN'T EVEN ENJOYED
WORKING ON <i>FLAVOR.</i>

19:50.126 --> 19:53.093
YOU'RE AN AMAZING PERSON,
KHADIJAH.

19:53.160 --> 19:56.060
I MEAN, YOU PERSEVERE,
YOU ACHIEVE

19:56.126 --> 19:59.533
YOU TAKE CARE OF SO MANY PEOPLE

19:59.600 --> 20:01.900
BUT SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY

20:01.966 --> 20:04.033
YOU STOPPED TAKING CARE
OF YOURSELF.

20:04.100 --> 20:08.400
WELL, I GUESS IT WOULD BE
KIND OF INTERESTING

20:08.466 --> 20:11.766
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT
FROM TIME TO TIME.

20:11.833 --> 20:14.733
THE STATE MEDICAL BOARD
SAID I'M ALLOWED TO DO THAT.

20:14.800 --> 20:20.800
DAMN, MY FRIENDS ARE GOING
TO WEAR ME OUT OVER THIS ONE.

20:20.866 --> 20:22.333
I KNOW.

20:22.400 --> 20:25.700
PSYCHOTHERAPY DOESN'T GET
MUCH RESPECT IN OUR COMMUNITY.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.233
MY FATHER KEEPS ASKING ME

20:27.300 --> 20:29.466
WHY DIDN'T I PICK
SOMETHING MORE REAL

20:29.533 --> 20:30.800
LIKE PLASTIC SURGERY.

20:30.866 --> 20:34.433
BUT THEN, THAT'S AN ISSUE
FOR ME AND MY THERAPIST.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.733
YOU KNOW, DOC,
I HEARD SOMETIMES

20:36.800 --> 20:39.466
YOU PEOPLE CHARGE
ON A SLIDING SCALE.

20:39.533 --> 20:42.366
ANY CHANCE THAT, UH...
FOR A SISTER

20:42.433 --> 20:47.033
THAT SCALE MIGHT SLIDE
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO FREE?

20:47.100 --> 20:49.366
NO, SISTER.

20:49.433 --> 20:51.266
BUT I'M SURE

20:51.333 --> 20:53.933
WE CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT
WHEN YOU GET BACK.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.600
I'M PRESCRIBING
A ONE‐WEEK VACATION FOR YOU.

20:56.666 --> 20:58.600
NO WORK, NO FRIENDS

20:58.666 --> 21:00.273
AND DID I MENTION NO WORK?

21:00.340 --> 21:01.473
WELL, WHAT
THE HELL

21:01.540 --> 21:03.806
AM I GOING TO DO
ON A VACATION?

21:03.873 --> 21:05.140
NOTHING.

21:05.206 --> 21:07.306
SCARY, ISN'T IT?

21:07.373 --> 21:08.540
I HATE VACATIONS.

21:08.606 --> 21:11.306
YOU'LL JUST HAVE
TO PRESCRIBE SOMETHING ELSE.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.540
OKAY, I'LL START YOU
ON PROZAC.

21:15.606 --> 21:17.373
THAT'LL STABILIZE
YOUR MOOD

21:17.440 --> 21:19.306
BUT THERE MAY BE
SOME SIDE EFFECTS

21:19.373 --> 21:21.373
LIKE HEADACHES,
LACK OF SEX DRIVE...

21:21.440 --> 21:22.373
PACKING!

21:22.440 --> 21:23.540
I'M PACKING.

21:24.906 --> 21:27.373
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I COME BACK.

21:28.940 --> 21:31.040
LIVING SINGLE
<i>WILL BE RIGHT BACK.</i>

21:36.773 --> 21:38.390
OVERTON, TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE.

21:38.457 --> 21:41.590
CLOWN.

21:44.424 --> 21:46.857
CLOWN.

21:49.690 --> 21:54.690
THAT LOOKS LIKE TWO BUTTERFLIES
KISSING IN A CARWASH.

21:54.757 --> 21:57.224
AND FOR SOME WACKY REASON

21:57.290 --> 21:59.764
ONE OF THEM
IS WEARING A SOMBRERO.

22:03.397 --> 22:06.897
