"Fugitive's back," from Julie.

00:12.142 --> 00:15.102
We were supposed to be
celebrating a new owner.

00:15.232 --> 00:17.017
Um...

00:18.235 --> 00:21.630
It would've been nice
to have a hot owner, but...

00:23.110 --> 00:24.589
She was outbid.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.200
APRIL:
We were all excited about having

00:26.330 --> 00:28.158
a longtime Fugitive fan
buy the team,

00:28.289 --> 00:32.336
even if that fan was
not your typical investor type.

00:32.467 --> 00:35.687
Crew of a bunch of, you know,
a bunch of single guys.

00:35.818 --> 00:37.515
Yeah, lot of single guys.

00:37.646 --> 00:40.170
APRIL: With her, we'd be
making our own decisions,

00:40.301 --> 00:41.737
but that's not
how it played out.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.521
Uh, we got a call.

00:43.652 --> 00:45.828
Blue Wing Capital came back
with a higher offer

00:45.958 --> 00:48.265
that Julie, as a solo investor,
couldn't match.

00:48.396 --> 00:50.267
Look at this,
she sent us hot sauce.

00:50.398 --> 00:51.529
She sent us Patrón.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.531
Like, she fucking got us.

00:53.662 --> 00:55.359
You know what
Blue Wing Capital got us?

00:55.490 --> 00:58.580
Uh, they-they made a donation
on our behalf

00:58.710 --> 01:00.364
to a children's hospital.

01:00.495 --> 01:02.627
We're fucked.

01:04.847 --> 01:08.068
-It might not be that bad.
-It will be that bad,

01:08.198 --> 01:09.678
-Nightfall, it will be.
-Will it?

01:09.808 --> 01:11.506
Yeah, do you remember
when those mouth breathers

01:11.636 --> 01:13.116
tried to buy Dignitas

01:13.247 --> 01:15.249
and change their name
to Capital One Falcons?

01:17.294 --> 01:20.080
Let's pour one out.
Pour one out for the dead.

01:20.210 --> 01:22.647
Who's gonna do
some Anal Angst with me?

01:22.778 --> 01:26.390
-Oh... [sputters]
-Whoever wants to join me.

01:26.521 --> 01:28.262
-It's a little early.
-I can't.

01:28.392 --> 01:30.960
My doctor says I can't go hotter
than Tabasco anymore.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.353
-CREAMCHEESE: Fine.
-You know I want to.

01:32.483 --> 01:33.571
I'll do it alone.

01:33.702 --> 01:35.704
To what could have been.

01:42.885 --> 01:45.192
Yum. Yum.

01:45.322 --> 01:46.497
That's really good.

01:46.628 --> 01:49.065

It's super good.
[exhales sharply]

Julie knows her hot sauces,
I'll say that much.

02:01.599 --> 02:03.732
-Do you want another one?
-After-- No,

02:03.862 --> 02:05.647
'cause the aftertaste
is kind of the best part,

02:05.777 --> 02:07.866

drown that out. [mutters]

a-a glass of milk?

02:14.395 --> 02:15.831
Look at this.

02:15.961 --> 02:18.616
The only reason
they paid so much was...

02:18.747 --> 02:19.791
because they wanted Organizm.

02:19.922 --> 02:21.967
This guy says,

02:22.098 --> 02:25.710
"The only reason
Fugitive would want Creamcheese

02:25.841 --> 02:28.278
is if Organizm
was holding a bagel."

02:28.409 --> 02:29.540
[laughs]

02:29.671 --> 02:30.933
Julie loved me.

02:31.063 --> 02:33.065
The only reason
Blue Wing outbid her

02:33.196 --> 02:34.980
is because they wanted him.

02:35.111 --> 02:36.373
He's boring,
and now he's the face

02:36.504 --> 02:37.635
of the organization.

02:37.766 --> 02:39.637
Like, no offense,

02:39.768 --> 02:41.335
but he has
a terrible personality

02:41.465 --> 02:43.250
and, like, no sex appeal at all.

02:43.380 --> 02:45.339
And where does that leave me,
you know?

02:45.469 --> 02:46.818
[scoffs]
Where does that leave you?

02:46.949 --> 02:49.038
I mean, come on,
they start making cuts,

02:49.169 --> 02:51.083
-I'm the first to go.
-Yeah, that's true.

08:16.147 --> 08:17.279
That's the tall one.
And then there's Kip.

08:17.409 --> 08:18.933
He British or Australian
or something,

08:19.063 --> 08:20.630
but he be saying "bloke" a lot.

08:20.761 --> 08:23.285
Hit 'em with the Elmore charm
now. Let's go, Pat!

08:23.415 --> 08:25.243
Hey, what's going on?
What's going on, Puma?

08:25.374 --> 08:27.071
CREAMCHEESE: The difference
between me and Organizm

08:27.202 --> 08:31.902
is O-Organizm... like, Organizm,
the idea, is super cool.

08:32.033 --> 08:34.252
He's, like, this enigmatic
rookie player,

08:34.383 --> 08:36.777
young guy, who's incredible.

08:36.907 --> 08:38.474
Percy,

08:38.605 --> 08:41.521
the guy behind Organizm,
is just not that cool.

08:41.651 --> 08:45.176
He just, you know,
he peed in jars, you know?

08:45.307 --> 08:46.613
You can tell, he's the type
of kid who did not

08:46.743 --> 08:48.179
have a lot of friends
in high school.

08:48.310 --> 08:51.226
Which is fine, I just--
that Trevor,

08:51.356 --> 08:53.402

08:53.533 --> 08:56.231
-Yo. What's up?
-Oh, there he is.

08:56.361 --> 08:58.668
Here comes trouble.

08:58.799 --> 09:01.279
Hey, um, tonight,
if you see, um, Mike Bertha,

09:01.410 --> 09:03.891
you tell him he owes me
15 bucks, though, okay?

09:04.021 --> 09:05.719
Yeah, of course. I love that.

09:05.849 --> 09:06.937
Make ten times as much
as that dude

09:07.068 --> 09:08.896
and still shake him down
for $15.

09:09.026 --> 09:10.201
It's the principle
of the thing.

09:10.332 --> 09:11.942
Yeah, well, it's fucking savage.

09:12.073 --> 09:14.075
-You excited?
-Oh, I'm just excited

09:14.205 --> 09:16.077

-Yep.

You know, as Cream's

09:17.600 --> 09:19.515

has gotten a lot bigger.

09:22.518 --> 09:24.912
Um, I mean, when we were
in high school together,

09:25.042 --> 09:27.175
I mean,
he was just a fun-loving kid.

09:27.305 --> 09:28.742
He was really comfortable
in his own skin.

09:30.787 --> 09:33.529

this goofy, funny kid

09:33.660 --> 09:35.531

pretty much liked.

09:35.662 --> 09:37.620

school's a hard time for them.

09:37.751 --> 09:40.449
It was a breeze for me.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.017
I was friends with everyone.
I was friends with the jocks,

09:43.147 --> 09:44.975

13:27.241 --> 13:28.851

one time he put a bunch
of rose petals in my car.

I casually mentioned

14:42.751 --> 14:46.886

Toblerone chocolate bars.

14:47.016 --> 14:49.279
Then the very next day,

this girl a Toblerone

14:57.635 --> 14:59.246

"Wha-- Do you expect me to eat,
like, a Toblerone a day?"

Turns out, Toblerones
are not the cheapest candy.

$2.99 per bar, so...

17:13.336 --> 17:15.208
CREAMCHEESE: Because it was
really cool to see him

17:15.338 --> 17:17.427
just achieving his dreams.

17:17.558 --> 17:19.516
-Right click to move. [laughs]
-Well, what keys do I click?

17:19.647 --> 17:21.649
-Move your, you...
-That was... She's got her...

17:21.779 --> 17:23.651
Have you ever taught
anyone anything ever?

17:23.781 --> 17:26.610
Alt, Windows, control.
Okay, try that.

17:26.741 --> 17:29.570
FRUGGER: I mean, listen, we're
talking about him at his peak.

17:29.700 --> 17:32.181
He could have been with
a K-Kardashian or Lindsay Lohan,

17:32.312 --> 17:34.053
or, like, one
of the Olsen twins, right?

17:34.183 --> 17:38.231
But... it wasn't about that.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.711
He wanted his, you know,
his high school sweetheart.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.278
[chuckles]

17:42.409 --> 17:43.540
First of all,
if you haven't hiked before,

17:43.671 --> 17:44.846
this is what happens.

17:44.976 --> 17:46.587
Everyone's hiked before
but you!

17:46.717 --> 17:50.069
You get in a car
to drive to walk...

17:50.199 --> 17:52.593
FRUGGER: For Cream, like,
he's very about loyalty.

17:52.723 --> 17:54.464
And he knows that,

17:54.595 --> 17:56.814
you know, she wasn't there
for the money

17:56.945 --> 17:58.816
and she wasn't there for
the fame and stuff like that.

17:58.947 --> 18:01.515
She was just there for him.

18:01.645 --> 18:03.778
How do you decide
when to, uh, stop?

18:03.908 --> 18:05.388
-When you get to the top.
-[laughs]: When you...

18:05.519 --> 18:08.522
CREAMCHEESE:
She liked me before Creamcheese.

18:08.652 --> 18:09.827
MORGAN:
Okay, I have

18:09.958 --> 18:11.133
-a present for you.
-All right.

18:11.264 --> 18:12.656
She liked me
even before Nutmilk.

18:12.787 --> 18:14.484
She-she liked me
back when I was just Trevor.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.356
Oh, my God, this is really nice.

18:16.486 --> 18:17.661
-Oh.
-Do you like it?

18:17.792 --> 18:19.794
Yeah, this is fucking awesome.

18:19.924 --> 18:21.926
[cheering]

18:22.057 --> 18:25.669
KYLE: He was the happiest
I think I've ever seen him.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.106
His mindset, it made
the whole team better.

18:27.236 --> 18:29.195
I've never seen
anything like it.

18:29.325 --> 18:31.675
-Yeah.
-KYLE: Go, go, go, go, go.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.851
-Into the pool.
-APRIL: Cream...

18:33.982 --> 18:35.723
risked it all.

18:35.853 --> 18:40.728
He gave up everything to be
a pro gamer, and it worked.

18:40.858 --> 18:42.599
So, Trevor's giving me a tour.

18:42.730 --> 18:44.427
I'm just, like, kind of curious
why Creamcheese

18:44.558 --> 18:46.429
isn't on this-this wall.

18:46.560 --> 18:48.997
Like, how are you, like,
not literally on this wall?

18:49.128 --> 18:51.391
She asks a question
every, like, ten seconds.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.219
-I don't know.
-Just soak it in, you know?

18:53.349 --> 18:57.092
I used to call him crazy
for thinking

18:57.223 --> 19:00.443
that he could play
video games for a living.

19:00.574 --> 19:03.968
-CREAMCHEESE: First step. Go.
-My first step.

19:04.099 --> 19:05.535
-Good.
-Doesn't this feel amazing?

19:05.666 --> 19:07.015
-Oh, you look so good next to...
-It's kind of crazy.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.800
MORGAN:
I told him I was wrong.

19:09.931 --> 19:14.936
And that I'm so proud of him.

19:15.066 --> 19:16.807
CREAMCHEESE:
This is like church to me.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.505
MORGAN:
I'm totally-- I totally get it.

19:18.635 --> 19:21.595
APRIL:
And that validation

19:21.725 --> 19:26.165
meant more to him
than he let on.

19:28.428 --> 19:31.518
I know that it hurts him

19:31.648 --> 19:34.260
to this day that he never
got that "I told you so"

19:34.390 --> 19:35.783
with his parents.

19:35.913 --> 19:36.958
But he got that with Morgan.

19:37.088 --> 19:39.265
These are champions.

19:39.395 --> 19:40.701
CREAMCHEESE:
You're a champion.

19:40.831 --> 19:42.442
You like it here?
It's cool, right?

19:42.572 --> 19:45.445
-It is cool. It is very cool.
-It's fucking sick.

19:45.575 --> 19:48.535
CREAMCHEESE: She fucking got it,
you know? Like...

19:48.665 --> 19:50.624
That was nice to hear.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.756
[overlapping chatter]

19:52.887 --> 19:54.149
CREAMCHEESE:
There we go. There we go.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.672
There we go, boys,
let's fucking go.

19:55.803 --> 19:58.022
APRIL:
In 2016, when we went

19:58.153 --> 19:59.763
all the way to the finals,

19:59.894 --> 20:02.723
Cream was the most confident
I've ever seen him,

20:02.853 --> 20:04.899
and Morgan
was a big part of that.

20:05.029 --> 20:07.031
-Yes, yes, yes!
-Let's do it.

20:07.162 --> 20:10.557
-Yeah. Fuck yeah, let's go.
-Vegas. Vegas.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.776
-Ugh! Vegas, baby.
-Let's fucking go.

20:12.907 --> 20:14.778
We're going to fucking Vegas!

20:14.909 --> 20:16.911
We were gonna play
in the Spring Split finals

20:17.041 --> 20:19.914
against TSM in our first season.

20:20.044 --> 20:22.656
[rhythmic grunting]

20:22.786 --> 20:25.572
This might have been
the best time of my life.

20:25.702 --> 20:28.444
MORGAN: They were going to Vegas
for the North American finals,

20:28.575 --> 20:30.359
and Trevor asked me

20:30.490 --> 20:32.143
if I wanted to come along.

20:32.274 --> 20:34.363
Of course, I said yes.

20:34.494 --> 20:36.539
I mean, honestly,
I-I still pinch myself

20:36.670 --> 20:38.193
when I come out onto the stage.

20:38.324 --> 20:40.064
It feels like
I'm living the dream.

20:40.195 --> 20:42.066
I really felt like
we were gonna win, you know?

20:42.197 --> 20:45.026
And Morgan was a big reason why.

20:48.072 --> 20:50.901
She was super cool.

20:51.032 --> 20:52.251
Yeah.

21:03.523 --> 21:05.525
[line ringing]

21:07.135 --> 21:09.442
Frugger, what's happening, dude?

21:12.096 --> 21:13.576
Sick. Yeah, I'm just, uh,

21:13.707 --> 21:15.230
I'm at Charlie Fitzpatrick's
in Claremont.

21:15.361 --> 21:16.797
You should come through.

21:19.365 --> 21:21.454
Yeah, it's my ten-year reunion,
but it's like an,

21:21.584 --> 21:24.065
it's an open thing, so you could
come through, for sure.

21:29.636 --> 21:31.159
Yeah.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.726
No, it's yeah.
I guess it's kind of

21:32.856 --> 21:34.467
out of the way for you, so...

21:37.948 --> 21:41.038
No, I know. Yeah, I'm probably
gonna head out anyway, so...

21:44.868 --> 21:48.524
Oh, yeah, it's a, it's a blast.
I'll talk to you later, man.

21:48.655 --> 21:49.917
Okay, bye.

21:53.616 --> 21:55.444
No Frugger, so...

21:59.100 --> 22:01.102
[indistinct chatter]

22:12.113 --> 22:13.941
MAN: Dude, I would love to play
video games for a living.

22:14.071 --> 22:15.508
Are you kidding me?
If I could pay my rent

22:15.638 --> 22:17.248
by playing video games,

22:17.379 --> 22:18.162
-that would be fucking dope.
-Oh, it's more than paying rent,

22:18.293 --> 22:19.381
-you know.
-Yeah.

22:19.512 --> 22:22.558
-It's a big deal.
-Yeah. Um...

22:22.689 --> 22:24.299
Hey, it's pretty cool
that they let us, like...

22:24.430 --> 22:26.170
-Guess how much!
-Sorry?

22:26.301 --> 22:27.824
Guess how much I make!

22:27.955 --> 22:30.218
Oh, sorry. Um... I-I don't know.

22:30.349 --> 22:33.352
-A hundred grand.
-No.

22:33.482 --> 22:36.790
-Okay, uh...
-It's a lot more than that.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.140
-$200,000.
-[laughs]: No. No.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.098
Not $200,000.

22:41.229 --> 22:43.449
So what do you make?
I don't, I don't know.

22:43.579 --> 22:49.019
$820,000 a year.

22:49.150 --> 22:51.500
Every single year.

22:51.631 --> 22:53.589
-Holy shit. Wow.
-Yeah.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.852
Good to see you, Callie.
So good to see you.

22:55.983 --> 22:57.593
-Sal.
-It's so good.

22:57.724 --> 23:00.553
-Goodbye, Dale.
-So proud of you.

23:00.683 --> 23:02.772
-Good to see you, man.
-Yes, you, too.

23:02.903 --> 23:04.034
-All right.
-All right.

23:04.165 --> 23:05.775
-Have a good night.
-Bye.

23:05.906 --> 23:06.994
CREAMCHEESE:
Get out of here, man.

23:07.124 --> 23:08.430
He looks so good.

23:08.561 --> 23:10.084
-He's amazing. That's...
-How did he do that?

23:10.214 --> 23:12.260
-That guy's incredible.
-I mean, a hundred pounds?

23:12.391 --> 23:13.348
-What?
-Hundred pounds

23:13.479 --> 23:14.741
-is a shit-ton of weight.
-Yeah.

23:14.871 --> 23:16.482
-No, he looks hot.
-That's...

23:16.612 --> 23:20.747
He was fucking fat
in high school, honestly.

23:20.877 --> 23:22.139
[phone vibrating]

23:22.270 --> 23:23.576
Oh, shit.

23:23.706 --> 23:26.187
One second, guys. Hey.

23:27.275 --> 23:30.278
Sup, girl. How are you?

23:35.631 --> 23:38.547
Dude, do not worry
about it at all.

23:38.678 --> 23:41.768
I-- No, I was just shooting off
texts to people who...

23:41.898 --> 23:44.074
Just hounding people who
hadn't shown up yet, you know?

23:44.205 --> 23:45.902
[Morgan laughs]

23:49.776 --> 23:51.212
Yeah.

23:51.342 --> 23:54.345
No, dude, it's-it's shit,
you know?

23:54.476 --> 23:56.783
But it's pretty fucking cool.

23:56.913 --> 23:58.524
Dale's lost a shit-ton
of weight.

23:58.654 --> 24:00.221
He looks, he looks, like,

24:00.351 --> 24:02.745
completely transformed,
honestly.

24:06.314 --> 24:07.837
Yeah.

24:07.968 --> 24:10.797
Everyone's
really psyched for him.

24:19.327 --> 24:23.157
-For sure. For sure.
-Um...

24:28.162 --> 24:31.905
I would love that.
I would absolutely love that.

24:32.035 --> 24:34.342
Okay.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.214
-Okay.
-Uh...

24:37.345 --> 24:39.956
Yeah, you too. Uh, good night.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.835
[sighs]

24:48.965 --> 24:51.794
I think I'm done, guys.
I think...

24:51.925 --> 24:53.753
I think I'm done for the night.

24:56.625 --> 24:57.844
[exhales]: Oh.

25:00.063 --> 25:01.064
[car door closes]

25:18.212 --> 25:19.822
Knew you'd be up,
you fucking nerd.

25:21.128 --> 25:23.173
I told you I would be.

25:23.304 --> 25:25.306
Classic shit, dude.

25:28.744 --> 25:30.398
You want to do one?

25:32.356 --> 25:34.533
Yeah.
[scoffs] Yeah.

25:41.148 --> 25:42.497
So, uh, how was it?

25:42.628 --> 25:44.717
People must have been
pretty excited

25:44.847 --> 25:46.719
to see Creamcheese.

25:46.849 --> 25:49.460
Yeah, man, it was like...

25:49.591 --> 25:52.420
It actually got
kind of annoying, you know?

25:58.339 --> 26:00.384
You want to go Cait-Lux here?

26:00.515 --> 26:02.909
Yeah. Yeah.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.741
You want this Toblerone?

26:11.700 --> 26:13.615
It's really fucking good.

26:13.746 --> 26:16.792
It's, like,
one of the best candies.

26:16.923 --> 26:20.187
-Yeah, I-I love these.
-Right?

26:22.189 --> 26:23.799
They're good.

26:26.149 --> 26:28.282
CREAMCHEESE:
I'll go in on level three.

26:28.412 --> 26:32.068
-Bears in the pots.
-CREAMCHEESE: I got Ulti...
