00:39.039 --> 00:42.082
Mother and Child

02:47.458 --> 02:49.251
Her birthday is coming up.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.589
She'll be 37.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.352
I spoke to Bill Colden about you.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.314
He says you're one of the best lawyers
he's ever worked with.

03:10.523 --> 03:13.275
And I know Bill.
Praise doesn't come easy to him.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.528
We had a good relationship.
He runs that firm well.

03:16.779 --> 03:17.946
Yes he does.

03:18.781 --> 03:22.951
So, in your estimation,
what are your professional strengths?

03:23.786 --> 03:26.538
Well, l don't believe in improvisation.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.624
I prepare my cases rigorously.

03:28.833 --> 03:31.501
I'm on top of clients. I handle them well.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.421
I protect them from themselves.

03:34.672 --> 03:36.590
I prefer to work on a project by myself

03:36.799 --> 03:39.927
but I can work just as well in a team,
if necessary.

03:40.136 --> 03:42.429
I work equally well with men or women...

03:42.764 --> 03:44.598
but I prefer to report to a man.

03:46.142 --> 03:47.184
Why's that?

03:47.435 --> 03:49.144
Many women find me threatening.

03:49.604 --> 03:52.898
- Would I be reporting to you?
- Yes.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.401
So, we'd have nothing to worry about, then.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.782
Why do you think women find you threatening?

04:02.492 --> 04:06.203
I'm not in the sisterhood. l'm my own person.

04:08.331 --> 04:14.127
I saw from this that you moved to
and from this area several times.

04:14.337 --> 04:17.005
I've gone wherever
I've had to go to get ahead.

04:17.214 --> 04:19.341
But you always return here.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.761
This part of the world is as good as any.

04:25.598 --> 04:28.517
Well Elizabeth,
your resume is very impressive.

04:28.768 --> 04:31.103
It's no secret you'd be a great asset to us.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.522
I would not disappoint you.

04:33.898 --> 04:35.190
If you wouldn't mind...

04:35.400 --> 04:37.985
could you give me
some of your personal background?

04:42.240 --> 04:45.367
I was born here in Los Angeles...

04:45.618 --> 04:48.954
and l was given up for adoption
on the day of my birth.

04:49.205 --> 04:51.873
My mother was 14 when she had me.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.084
And that's all I know about her.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.461
My adoptive father died when I was 10.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.673
My adoptive mother and I are not close.

05:00.133 --> 05:05.178
My name, Elizabeth Joyce,
is one I picked out for myself in junior high.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.265
It's my legal name now.
I don't go by any other.

05:08.641 --> 05:09.975
I live alone.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.686
I have since I turned 17.

05:13.604 --> 05:19.234
I've never been married,
and l have no plans to marry.

05:19.944 --> 05:22.779
I value my independence above all things.

05:22.989 --> 05:26.241
That way I don't have
any expectations to fulfill...

05:26.409 --> 05:29.953
other than my own, which are great enough.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.124
That's all she wrote.

05:36.085 --> 05:38.962
We've been married for four years.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.423
And we've been trying from the beginning.

05:41.924 --> 05:45.886
But we just haven't been able to.

05:46.763 --> 05:50.891
And we've been hoping,
you know, against hope, as they say...

05:51.100 --> 05:53.935
but that just isn't going to be.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.064
And we've accepted that.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.690
And we're not bitter.

05:58.900 --> 05:59.858
I mean, l don't think...

06:00.068 --> 06:02.319
Do you think we're bitter about it?

06:02.612 --> 06:05.155
No. No, we're not.

06:05.448 --> 06:09.743
So, we could be good parents, you know.

06:09.994 --> 06:14.122
Joseph is a very tender man.
He's affectionate.

06:14.332 --> 06:17.959
And, we could learn to love a baby
in a minute,

06:18.336 --> 06:20.003
even if it wasn't ours.

06:21.255 --> 06:23.423
Would we get to name the baby ourselves?

06:23.674 --> 06:26.051
It depends on the circumstances.

06:26.260 --> 06:31.723
Sometimes the biological parents
and the adoptive parents agree on a name.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.101
We could agree to agree.

06:39.899 --> 06:44.069
Well, we're ready now, to adopt.

06:44.445 --> 06:46.780
I mean, blood is important...

06:46.989 --> 06:50.700
but it's the time spent together
that really matters.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.452
Isn't that right?

06:53.871 --> 06:56.373
- Oh my god.
- What? What? What?

06:56.666 --> 06:58.375
Why didn't you shut me up?

06:59.293 --> 07:00.043
It's alright, Lucy,

07:00.378 --> 07:01.711
everyone who goes to her office is nervous,
okay?

07:02.046 --> 07:05.132
Gave that whole speech about time
spent together. Where the hell did l get that?

07:05.383 --> 07:07.092
- Baby, I have no idea.
- Why didn't you open your mouth?

07:07.301 --> 07:07.843
Lucy don't try...

07:08.177 --> 07:10.178
Why didn't you say a word?

07:10.513 --> 07:11.888
Sweetie, she liked you.

07:12.098 --> 07:15.100
- Do you think?
- Yes, I think. Just relax.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.643
Okay.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.021
How does that feel?

07:21.649 --> 07:22.941
It feels okay.

07:23.192 --> 07:24.818
Just okay?

07:26.529 --> 07:28.405
It feels good.

07:29.365 --> 07:32.242
Please God, let us find a baby.

07:36.080 --> 07:37.414
I got ya.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.082
Oh.

07:39.959 --> 07:44.129
Good, Louise. Put your arm on the side.
There ya go.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.966
This is our general therapy area
where we treat patients with chronic pain...

07:48.217 --> 07:50.927
and acute injuries.

07:55.224 --> 07:56.808
- Hi. Janelle.
- Hi. Paco.

07:57.101 --> 07:58.727
- Here.
- Thanks.

08:05.401 --> 08:07.903
Is that man flirting with you?

08:08.613 --> 08:10.322
Yes he was.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.765
Hi.

08:37.099 --> 08:38.475
Hello.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.393
Say hello to Karen, mija.

08:40.645 --> 08:41.937
Hi.

08:43.397 --> 08:46.191
Your mother had a good day.

08:46.442 --> 08:48.235
She ate really well.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.487
And how long's she been asleep?

08:50.738 --> 08:53.657
For about half an hour. She really needed it.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.952
I can change her into her nightgown
before l leave.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.495
I'll do that.

08:58.829 --> 09:00.956
I'm gonna be a little late tomorrow.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.501
It's back to school for this one.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.128
Ah.

09:15.096 --> 09:17.347
I'll see you tomorrow.

09:47.211 --> 09:48.837
These need clipping.

09:51.090 --> 09:54.884
Mom, l'm gonna look for a new person for you.

09:55.636 --> 10:01.558
Sofia never asked me if I minded that she
brought the girl over while school was out.

10:01.851 --> 10:05.353
I don't know what I would've said,
but she should've asked me.

10:06.188 --> 10:08.315
You cannot fire her.

10:38.179 --> 10:41.431
Hi. We're Steven and Tracy from next door.

10:41.724 --> 10:45.352
We just wanted to come by and say hi
and welcome to the building.

10:45.519 --> 10:46.811
Thank you.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.522
We only moved in two months ago, so, you know

10:49.857 --> 10:51.691
we know what it's like not to know anyone.

10:51.942 --> 10:54.235
It's a pretty safe building though,
don't you think?

10:54.528 --> 10:55.403
I mean, we think so.

10:55.696 --> 10:57.489
Yes, it's quiet.

10:58.366 --> 11:01.534
Yeah. So you're here all by yourself, right?

11:01.994 --> 11:03.161
Yes, that's right.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.331
Yeah. I told Steven that I thought so.
Didn't l?

11:06.791 --> 11:07.916
Yeah. Yeah.

11:08.084 --> 11:11.211
It's mostly single people in the building,
you know, no children.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.837
So far.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.260
You know,
I was just in the middle of something.

11:19.470 --> 11:22.639
Oh, don't worry. We'll talk again.
I'm home most days...

11:22.848 --> 11:25.767
and so just, you know, come by
and borrow a cup of sugar or something.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.062
It was nice meeting you.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.279
Lucy, are you there?

11:38.614 --> 11:40.198
Lucy-Lu!

11:40.991 --> 11:43.118
Are you there, or aren't you?

11:44.912 --> 11:48.915
Lucy.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.085
I'm not home.

11:52.336 --> 11:54.879
Okay, call me back.
I'll try you back in a little while.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.506
Oh yeah, yeah. Yeah. Oh.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.050
I don't know if this thing is still recording
or if l got cut off.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.052
ls this thing still recording? Lucy?

12:01.387 --> 12:03.096
- l'm sorry. I can't.
- Don't stop.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.223
- Lucy. Okay, okay. Okay, l'm gone.
- l lost it. l lost it.

12:05.516 --> 12:06.433
- Come on, Lucy.
- Okay, bye.

12:06.809 --> 12:07.934
I lost it.

12:11.188 --> 12:13.898
I had a new dream a couple of days ago.

12:14.150 --> 12:19.070
I come home and try to get in
but my key breaks inside the lock.

12:19.321 --> 12:23.700
I look through the window
and l can see you in my bed sleeping.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.035
I go in through the back door

12:26.287 --> 12:29.706
and walk up to you and smell your breath.

12:29.874 --> 12:34.711
It smells of another woman's breast milk,
not mine.

12:34.962 --> 12:37.714
And the bed is wet.

12:41.844 --> 12:45.513
You've wet the bed and I start to cry...

12:45.723 --> 12:49.726
because I don't have clean sheets
to make it fresh.

12:49.977 --> 12:52.312
Sorry, I didn't mean to stare.

12:53.314 --> 12:56.232
Paco. Karen, right?

12:56.901 --> 12:58.985
Clara told me your name.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.612
Clara?

13:01.197 --> 13:03.156
What else did she say about me?

13:03.699 --> 13:04.991
Nothing else.

13:05.284 --> 13:08.286
She always has time on her hands
to be talking to someone.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.330
That's why her work stinks.

13:20.758 --> 13:24.427
So, was it your idea or his?

13:24.637 --> 13:27.722
Oh, please don't, okay?
I just need your support on this.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.475
Oh, well see,
I was just wondering whose idea it was.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.061
It was my idea. Okay?

13:36.774 --> 13:40.026
Your mother-in-law is gonna blow a gasket...

13:40.236 --> 13:43.404
her prince raising the child of a stranger.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.615
What about you?

13:46.742 --> 13:48.785
Are you gonna love this baby or no?

13:50.371 --> 13:53.039
Well, there is no baby to speak of yet.

13:55.376 --> 13:57.252
What's the next step?

13:58.045 --> 14:02.507
We are meeting a woman on Wednesday.

14:02.883 --> 14:06.094
She is six months pregnant.

14:06.470 --> 14:09.556
And she's just now deciding
to give up this baby?

14:09.723 --> 14:13.935
No. Apparently she's already turned down
a few couples.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.186
Turned down?

14:15.437 --> 14:18.773
Who's approving who? There's an argument
that you'd be doing her a favor.

14:19.191 --> 14:20.817
Nobody's doing anybody a favor.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.528
Okay, everybody stands to win.

14:23.737 --> 14:26.698
You know there is so much positioning
for everything nowadays.

14:26.991 --> 14:31.411
Motherhood should be something simpler
than that.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.666
I'm sorry, Lucy.

14:37.459 --> 14:39.669
That was a horrible thing to say.

14:39.837 --> 14:43.631
I'm sorry, Lu. l'm an idiot. Forgive me.

14:43.841 --> 14:44.966
Please, l'm sorry.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.343
Oh, you really wear me out.

14:55.936 --> 14:58.563
Ah. We gave you one of our better offices.

14:59.189 --> 15:00.857
And what did l do to deserve it?

15:01.066 --> 15:03.693
Nothing, but we have high hopes.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.236
As well you should.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.155
Any questions? Concerns?

15:08.741 --> 15:09.866
No.

15:13.162 --> 15:17.081
Welcome dinner tomorrow night,
Mistral, 8:15. You know it?

15:17.291 --> 15:18.416
Sure.

15:18.584 --> 15:19.834
See you there.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.510
How's work?

15:30.387 --> 15:31.888
It's good.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.515
There's a new training program...

15:34.725 --> 15:38.645
to work with people who are recuperating
from chemotherapy.

15:39.605 --> 15:44.692
They asked if any of us wanted to participate,
and l said yes.

15:44.860 --> 15:49.030
So, they're paying us to learn something new,
so that's good.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.498
There's a new therapist.

15:59.083 --> 16:02.794
He's a man, oh he's my age.

16:03.003 --> 16:06.214
He's a little heavyset.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.634
He's graying, you know?

16:12.221 --> 16:13.888
He's friendly.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.308
Everybody likes him.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.523
Watch yourself, Karen.

16:23.732 --> 16:26.693
Don't set yourself up for falls.

16:37.079 --> 16:39.288
Alright, now press up against my hand.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.416
That's right. Now let it go.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.043
Very good. Just like that. Okay?

16:44.294 --> 16:45.461
Amy.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.339
Here you go.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.217
Oh, here comes Valentino.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.597
Hey.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.521
I feel like we got off on the wrong foot.

17:03.897 --> 17:04.771
Why do you say that?

17:04.982 --> 17:06.816
Well you seemed a little upset
the other day when...

17:07.067 --> 17:09.484
You don't know me well enough to know
if I was upset.

17:20.329 --> 17:22.205
That was good work, Karen.

17:38.849 --> 17:44.645
I have some time before I have to be home.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.648
I'm getting a cup of coffee.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.946
Do you mind if I join you?

17:57.868 --> 17:59.452
Alright.

18:02.414 --> 18:03.372
You folks ready?

18:03.582 --> 18:05.041
Coffee, black, please.

18:05.667 --> 18:06.793
Same for me.

18:08.378 --> 18:09.295
Thank you.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.173
- You know what? l'll have the apple pie, too.
- Okay.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.509
Can't seem to stay away from apple pie.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.427
You should watch your weight.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.639
Yeah, l should.

18:22.226 --> 18:25.019
So, how long have you been at the clinic?

18:25.729 --> 18:29.023
I've been there six years, six months.

18:29.274 --> 18:32.360
April 11th, 2004 was my first day.

18:32.569 --> 18:33.611
Good memory.

18:33.779 --> 18:37.740
Yeah. l was at Westside Memorial
for eleven years before that.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.575
Westside, l hear that's a good place.

18:39.827 --> 18:43.996
Yeah well I didn't see eye-to-eye
with my supervisor.

18:44.248 --> 18:47.667
She was sloppy and she needed me
to pick up the slack for her.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.962
I got tired of it and I told her so...

18:51.296 --> 18:52.964
and she had me fired.

18:55.509 --> 18:56.759
This is cold.

18:57.177 --> 18:58.261
Oh.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.852
So what about you?

19:07.354 --> 19:11.524
I've been down here like five months now.
I'm from the Bay Area.

19:12.025 --> 19:13.901
Been a therapist for four years.

19:14.069 --> 19:16.028
Before that l drove for a car company.

19:16.280 --> 19:17.405
I'm divorced.

19:18.615 --> 19:21.242
I'm a grandfather. Can you imagine?

19:22.035 --> 19:24.662
And my daughter Melissa,
she's 28, she has twins.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.498
They weren't exactly planned but...

19:27.708 --> 19:31.085
what can you do?
She's happy. She still lives up there.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.843
What else would you like to know?

19:39.094 --> 19:42.638
We don't have to interrogate each other.
This is not a date.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.557
Interrogate's a harsh word.

19:46.476 --> 19:47.602
You live by yourself?

19:47.769 --> 19:48.978
No.

19:51.148 --> 19:54.025
- What's so funny?
- No, nothing.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.736
I just can't seem to say
the right things around you,

19:56.987 --> 19:58.571
and l'm trying. Believe me.

19:58.947 --> 19:59.697
What do you mean?

19:59.907 --> 20:03.492
I just feel like l keep putting my foot
in my mouth every time I talk to you, and...

20:03.827 --> 20:05.161
I just don't know why.

20:07.581 --> 20:10.291
Look, l'm sorry. Let's forget l said that.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.168
I don't know what I'm talking about.

20:12.753 --> 20:14.170
I'm not a difficult person.

20:14.379 --> 20:15.504
No, l don't mean that.

20:15.672 --> 20:18.758
- No, you're not comfortable with me.
- No, I am.

20:18.967 --> 20:22.303
- My words are too harsh for you.
- No...no...no...no...no, I...

20:23.430 --> 20:24.722
Do you know what you want?

20:24.932 --> 20:26.182
I don't care.

20:27.434 --> 20:28.684
A boy.

20:28.852 --> 20:31.103
Biological parents get to visit their children

20:31.396 --> 20:32.980
and have a hand in their upbringing.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.774
- lsn't that the case now?
- No.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.735
No, it's your child. You call the shots.

20:37.986 --> 20:40.321
It's just without all that secrecy, you know?

20:40.489 --> 20:45.201
So if one day our baby wants to know
where they come from...

20:45.619 --> 20:46.911
then they have a right to know.

20:47.079 --> 20:51.082
I hope they don't change their minds
about all these rules 20 years from now.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.919
You know, they always seem to change
their minds about things like that.

20:55.587 --> 20:56.587
Who does?

20:56.797 --> 20:58.506
The experts.

21:02.970 --> 21:06.097
Well, l think Joseph's gonna be a great dad.

21:06.306 --> 21:07.306
Don't you think?

21:07.724 --> 21:09.225
Yes.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.227
It's all he's ever wanted.

21:18.402 --> 21:19.652
Hey, Elizabeth.

21:19.861 --> 21:21.946
I didn't realize it was just the two of us.

21:22.197 --> 21:24.657
Oh, my partners would put you to sleep
in a minute.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.534
I thought this would be better.

21:27.202 --> 21:28.828
It's not what I expected.

21:29.079 --> 21:31.080
I hope you don't think it's inappropriate.

21:31.415 --> 21:34.458
I just like to know what everything means,
that's all.

21:34.626 --> 21:37.628
Just the boss getting acquainted
with his new employee.

21:51.518 --> 21:52.977
Something to drink?

21:53.270 --> 21:55.896
- Sparkling water.
- Yes ma'am.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.363
Are you married?

22:04.573 --> 22:08.200
I was. My wife passed away five years ago.

22:08.535 --> 22:11.537
- What was her name?
- Maureen.

22:13.373 --> 22:16.250
What about her do you miss the most?

22:16.918 --> 22:18.586
We were close.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.921
That's hard to come by.

22:21.214 --> 22:23.382
That's what l miss most about her.

22:24.468 --> 22:28.596
In fact, my children say my wife and I were
closer to each other than we were to them.

22:28.972 --> 22:30.723
I was hoping they hadn't noticed.

22:33.310 --> 22:34.435
How old are they?

22:34.603 --> 22:35.936
Maria's 29.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.938
Julian's 30.

22:38.273 --> 22:39.648
You started young.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.317
Not so young.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.736
So you're no spring chicken.

22:43.945 --> 22:46.781
No. No l'm not.

22:47.616 --> 22:49.325
You're still handsome.

22:51.787 --> 22:52.995
Thank you.

23:02.923 --> 23:08.427
Mom?

23:18.814 --> 23:23.275
Mom.

23:35.872 --> 23:40.793
That young doctor, he said he'd be back
first thing in the morning to talk to us.

23:42.170 --> 23:44.213
I don't wanna die here.

23:44.381 --> 23:47.842
You're not gonna die. You're gonna be fine.

23:49.678 --> 23:51.971
Expect me to live forever?

23:52.514 --> 23:54.557
Don't start that again.

23:56.393 --> 23:59.186
Even if I could l wouldn't want to.

23:59.855 --> 24:03.107
Just one disappointment after another.

24:23.628 --> 24:24.879
What?

24:31.094 --> 24:32.678
What, Mom?

25:08.423 --> 25:10.341
What keeps you here so late?

25:11.301 --> 25:13.010
Sneider and Lubezky.

25:13.261 --> 25:16.055
Oh. Not easy clients.

25:16.306 --> 25:20.226
They're downright difficult.
But they'll be happy with that.

25:20.602 --> 25:23.938
How 'bout you? Time for beddy-bye?

25:24.105 --> 25:27.024
Yes. Yes it is.

25:29.486 --> 25:31.946
Well l could invite you over for a drink.

25:32.155 --> 25:34.490
Unless you think that's inappropriate.

25:39.913 --> 25:41.705
We'll take your car.

25:43.667 --> 25:48.254
- Oh... - Oh, hi. We were just talking
about you. Weren't we, Steve?

25:48.505 --> 25:51.757
'Cause l'm getting up to use
the bathroom seven times a night...

25:52.050 --> 25:54.802
and our rooms are back-to-back
and l just hope l'm not waking you.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.303
I haven't heard a thing.

25:56.429 --> 25:59.431
Oh good, good.
Well, you'd let us know, wouldn't you?

25:59.599 --> 26:01.016
Sure.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.519
- l'm Paul.
- Oh, hi.

26:03.853 --> 26:05.187
I'm sorry. This is Steven

26:06.022 --> 26:07.273
and tell me your name again.

26:07.524 --> 26:09.024
- Tracy.
- Tracy.

26:09.192 --> 26:11.235
This is Paul, my father.

26:11.444 --> 26:14.405
Oh, it's so nice to meet you, sir.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.532
Spending the night in the garage?

26:16.783 --> 26:18.200
- Oh...
- Oh, no.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.703
It's for a birthing class that starts tonight.

26:21.746 --> 26:23.539
He's my coach.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.166
We'll get out of your way, then.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.795
- Good night.
- Nice meeting you.

26:34.467 --> 26:35.801
Adopted, right?

26:36.761 --> 26:40.347
So what was that about, out there?

26:41.808 --> 26:43.934
She was almost pleased you were Black.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.227
Did you notice?

26:45.478 --> 26:48.814
It was a chance for her to exercise
her liberal good will.

26:49.566 --> 26:52.318
Now they'll be doing the math all night.

26:52.527 --> 26:55.863
Maybe the father's only half-Black
and the mother is White.

26:56.239 --> 26:58.032
They seem like nice enough people.

26:58.283 --> 27:01.285
Oh, come on.
It's impossible to know what they are.

27:01.578 --> 27:05.998
They're too busy reinventing themselves
to everyone's liking.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.377
Cheers.

27:17.510 --> 27:19.511
What are you thinking about?

27:22.974 --> 27:25.059
My wife.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.436
Maureen.

27:38.448 --> 27:40.282
You'll be okay.

27:44.412 --> 27:47.831
I want you to drink the rest in one go.

29:22.594 --> 29:23.719
No.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.721
Stay still.

29:26.347 --> 29:29.725
Don't move, old man.

29:43.364 --> 29:45.908
That feels good.

29:52.749 --> 29:54.833
Let me come first.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.781
Now you.

30:47.595 --> 30:51.306
Good boy, Paul.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.225
Good boy.

32:47.465 --> 32:48.632
Be yourselves.

32:48.800 --> 32:52.177
You have a lot going for you.
She wants a young couple.

32:52.428 --> 32:56.306
She wants a woman with a job or a career.
And you have the bakery.

32:56.557 --> 32:58.517
Lucy, she'll like that.

32:59.560 --> 33:00.936
Questions?

33:02.438 --> 33:03.480
No.

33:04.190 --> 33:05.607
All right.

33:10.154 --> 33:12.239
I love you, Joseph.

33:15.076 --> 33:16.201
This is Ray.

33:16.411 --> 33:18.036
This is Lucy and Joseph.

33:18.287 --> 33:19.287
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:19.455 --> 33:20.747
Hello.

33:21.249 --> 33:22.874
I'll let you talk.

33:23.084 --> 33:24.376
How long do we have?

33:24.836 --> 33:26.628
As long as we need.

33:36.431 --> 33:39.516
I've already turned down several couples.

33:39.809 --> 33:40.976
Did she tell you that?

33:41.686 --> 33:43.186
Yeah.

33:43.479 --> 33:46.106
Well what kind of people are you looking for?

33:46.274 --> 33:49.151
I wanna hear from her first before
I talk to you.

33:55.742 --> 33:58.452
You must have something you wanna say.

33:58.619 --> 34:01.747
Most people have a speech prepared of
some kind.

34:05.960 --> 34:07.502
Come on.

34:07.837 --> 34:10.714
What did you expect from this meeting?

34:12.341 --> 34:17.637
Well l didn't expect to feel like
I'd been dragged into a principal's office.

34:17.847 --> 34:21.475
- Which is how I feel right now.
- Okay.

34:21.726 --> 34:24.811
- Good answer.
- Okay.

34:25.188 --> 34:27.731
I'll ask you some questions?

34:28.524 --> 34:30.609
Do you believe in God?

34:30.902 --> 34:32.819
I was raised Catholic.

34:33.029 --> 34:34.987
Do you believe in God?

34:36.949 --> 34:40.327
- Well I'm not a very religious person
but Joseph is.

34:40.495 --> 34:41.786
Aren't you?

34:42.163 --> 34:45.540
You don't believe that a higher being
created you and loves you...

34:45.792 --> 34:47.626
and looks after you?

34:53.174 --> 34:55.926
No. l'm sorry.

34:56.219 --> 34:57.803
What do you believe?

34:58.971 --> 35:00.263
I don't know.

35:00.431 --> 35:02.349
Tell me what you believe.

35:05.186 --> 35:06.520
No.

35:06.687 --> 35:08.396
Look, let's not play games.

35:08.564 --> 35:11.733
You either wanna tell me
who you are or you don't.

35:12.026 --> 35:15.695
If you don't, I'd rather us just part ways.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.075
Okay wait, wait, wait.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.997
Sit down.

35:29.669 --> 35:31.253
Please.

35:42.390 --> 35:47.352
I believe that when we're born we come
from nothing.

35:47.562 --> 35:51.106
And that when we die we go back to nothing.

35:52.483 --> 35:53.817
That what we make of our lives...

35:53.985 --> 35:58.572
is as a result of our will and our luck...

35:58.739 --> 36:02.742
the strength of our character
and a roll of the die.

36:04.537 --> 36:06.913
And this is what you would teach a child?

36:10.418 --> 36:12.002
Yes.

36:12.503 --> 36:15.463
This is what you would teach my baby.

36:15.840 --> 36:19.509
The baby would be my baby to teach.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.511
Why didn't you shut me up?

36:21.721 --> 36:23.889
Why did you just sit there like a dummy?

36:24.307 --> 36:25.557
You should've told me to shut up, Joseph.

36:25.892 --> 36:26.349
What were you think...

36:26.559 --> 36:27.976
- Lucy, Lucy, will you just stop it, please?
- No! No!

36:28.394 --> 36:29.728
Do not treat me like a child.

36:30.146 --> 36:31.146
Jesus Christ, Lucy.

36:31.439 --> 36:33.523
It didn't go well, Sister.

36:34.525 --> 36:36.735
She wants to meet again.

36:38.779 --> 36:39.988
What did she say?

36:40.156 --> 36:43.700
Nothing.
Not a word, but she wants to see you again.

36:44.327 --> 36:46.244
I don't believe it.

36:46.412 --> 36:48.330
She can do Friday morning.

36:48.706 --> 36:50.457
Friday's not good for me.

36:50.666 --> 36:52.417
Well then you should come in by yourself,
Lucy.

36:52.752 --> 36:54.419
You don't wanna lose momentum.

36:57.506 --> 36:59.966
- Yes.
- Yes?

37:01.469 --> 37:03.470
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yup.

37:03.679 --> 37:04.804
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

37:05.014 --> 37:06.514
I'm sorry.

37:10.686 --> 37:12.562
She's gone now.

37:14.065 --> 37:16.816
She will never see your face...

37:17.026 --> 37:20.570
and you will never see hers.

37:21.948 --> 37:25.951
There will always be a silence between you.

37:26.369 --> 37:29.079
I don't want that for us.

37:30.539 --> 37:32.499
For you and me.

37:33.876 --> 37:36.711
I know in my heart that we will meet one day

37:37.004 --> 37:39.631
and you will forgive me.

37:43.052 --> 37:45.428
Your mother was a good woman, Karen.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.973
I'm glad it was over quickly for her.

37:49.016 --> 37:50.642
She was ready.

37:53.354 --> 37:55.563
How the hell do you know if she was ready?

37:55.773 --> 37:57.148
She said so.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.317
She said no such thing to you.

37:59.735 --> 38:01.194
She did not.

38:03.406 --> 38:06.825
Obviously l don't need you five days
a week anymore.

38:07.034 --> 38:08.994
You're right. You don't.

38:09.245 --> 38:12.247
Once is enough. You pick the day.

38:13.165 --> 38:15.250
- Saturday.
- No.

38:15.459 --> 38:18.253
I want the house to myself on the weekend.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.922
I'm going to take another job.

38:21.090 --> 38:22.966
And that will be from Monday through Friday.

38:23.259 --> 38:26.594
You can take either Saturday or Sunday.

38:26.804 --> 38:29.097
And Cristi will have to come with me.

38:29.765 --> 38:31.391
I know you don't like her.

38:32.727 --> 38:33.935
That's not true.

38:34.186 --> 38:36.521
She knows how to stay out of your way.

38:51.287 --> 38:53.747
Say hi to everyone for me.

38:58.669 --> 38:59.919
Well thank you for coming in.

39:00.254 --> 39:01.588
- Okay.
- Okay.

39:10.306 --> 39:12.307
Hi. Tom Weller.

39:12.558 --> 39:13.808
- Hi.
- What can I do for you today?

39:14.018 --> 39:16.936
- Karen.
- Well it's nice to meet you, Karen.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.610
Karen.

39:25.863 --> 39:27.739
Wow.

39:28.282 --> 39:32.660
Do you... sorry. Sit.

39:36.165 --> 39:39.959
I was in this branch about three years ago
and l saw you.

39:40.252 --> 39:43.463
I ran out of here like the place was on fire.

39:47.676 --> 39:49.594
My mother died.

39:59.939 --> 40:01.523
How are you?

40:04.360 --> 40:06.945
You married that girl from NoHo High.

40:07.071 --> 40:09.739
- Right? Hailey?
- Hailey, yeah.

40:09.949 --> 40:11.032
Do you have kids?

40:11.325 --> 40:15.787
Yeah- we have two boys, and a girl.

40:19.083 --> 40:23.795
But they're gone now.
They, you know, they have their own lives.

40:29.385 --> 40:31.886
I think about you all the time.

40:39.228 --> 40:42.230
My daughter asked me if I was dating.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.315
I didn't know what to tell her.

40:46.193 --> 40:49.487
You're having an affair
with one of your attorneys.

40:50.698 --> 40:54.701
Well is it an affair
if neither party is married?

40:55.870 --> 40:59.372
An affair is any sexual
or romantic relationship...

40:59.707 --> 41:02.584
of an informal or temporary nature.

41:06.213 --> 41:08.089
Why thank you, Counselor.

41:11.886 --> 41:15.305
I read your brief on the Nelligan case.

41:15.514 --> 41:17.098
It's outstanding.

41:17.433 --> 41:22.437
You cited Escalante versus L.A. County,
which is a very obscure case...

41:22.688 --> 41:24.397
but perfect for this.

41:24.815 --> 41:26.232
Good work.

41:29.236 --> 41:33.281
I'm recommending you to lead the Thomas
and Thompson team.

41:35.701 --> 41:38.286
You think that's gonna go over well
with Guinness

41:38.704 --> 41:40.330
and Wilder and all your wonder boys out there?

41:40.539 --> 41:44.709
Oh, they'll have to eat it. lt is my law firm.

41:47.296 --> 41:49.380
I'm gonna have to pass.

41:50.007 --> 41:51.591
Thank you, though.

41:54.220 --> 41:56.387
Why would you do that?

41:57.598 --> 42:00.183
When l've been here long enough to win
this kind of promotion,

42:00.392 --> 42:01.809
I'll take it.

42:03.479 --> 42:05.605
I know I deserve it.

42:05.856 --> 42:08.024
But just give me a chance to earn it.

42:11.487 --> 42:15.156
What do you want for yourself, professionally?

42:16.200 --> 42:19.827
I wanna sit on the Circuit Court of Appeals.

42:21.163 --> 42:25.500
You've been at four firms
in three cities in ten years.

42:25.668 --> 42:27.627
That's not a good strategy.

42:27.795 --> 42:29.796
You wanna sit tight at one place,

42:30.005 --> 42:33.716
develop relationships, win the appointments.

42:34.343 --> 42:37.512
That's not how I wanna live my life.

42:37.763 --> 42:39.347
I'll get there.

42:40.683 --> 42:43.893
There are many ways to skin a cat.

43:15.718 --> 43:20.221
You know, you haven't asked me anything
about what it's been like for me...

43:20.431 --> 43:22.223
all this time.

43:25.185 --> 43:28.688
- Well...
- No, it needed to come from you.

43:37.781 --> 43:39.782
What l felt with you...

43:39.992 --> 43:43.536
I've never felt again for anyone.

43:46.874 --> 43:48.583
Do you remember?

43:56.258 --> 43:57.884
Yeah.

44:16.236 --> 44:17.737
Hey Karen.

44:18.697 --> 44:21.449
Sorry to hear about your mother.

44:21.825 --> 44:24.535
Loss of a parent's a horrible thing.

44:27.247 --> 44:28.623
Yeah. Thank you.

44:59.863 --> 45:01.155
Hey!

45:01.907 --> 45:02.824
Is this yours?

45:02.950 --> 45:04.200
Yeah, they're tomatoes from my garden.

45:04.493 --> 45:05.618
Yeah, what the hell's it doing hanging
on my locker?

45:05.869 --> 45:06.619
I just thought you might like them.

45:06.829 --> 45:08.246
Yeah, what made you think that, you jerk?

45:08.455 --> 45:10.289
I don't appreciate being in my place of work

45:10.499 --> 45:12.667
and finding this hanging on my locker
for everyone to see...

45:13.085 --> 45:14.293
like I'm your god damn girlfriend.

45:14.503 --> 45:16.045
You're an idiot!

45:16.630 --> 45:17.922
Hey.

45:18.173 --> 45:19.507
Hey!

45:19.925 --> 45:23.428
You know, the word is thank you, you weirdo.

45:23.762 --> 45:26.889
Fucking rude!

45:27.933 --> 45:29.600
Weirdo!

45:39.486 --> 45:41.404
Where's your wife?

45:41.613 --> 45:43.823
She won't be back until ten.

45:48.245 --> 45:49.454
No. No-no.

45:49.663 --> 45:52.832
That's today's menu. Take it or leave it.

45:59.465 --> 46:01.299
This fun for you?

46:04.928 --> 46:07.096
No surprises.

46:22.613 --> 46:24.280
Well how 'bout a drink?

46:33.081 --> 46:36.542
Why don't we just go back to your place?

46:48.263 --> 46:50.556
Let's get going, cowboy.

47:22.089 --> 47:24.382
I'm the one who should apologize.

47:24.967 --> 47:28.511
Well, let's just try to forget about it.

47:29.221 --> 47:31.597
- Alright.
- Okay.

47:39.064 --> 47:42.817
- l'm not a weirdo but...
- No.

47:43.193 --> 47:43.776
l didn't mean that.

47:44.069 --> 47:46.362
Let me finish. Okay?

47:47.030 --> 47:50.074
I'm not a weirdo but l'm difficult.

47:50.367 --> 47:52.910
Okay? I don't make friends easily.

47:53.453 --> 47:56.289
I demand a lot from others.

47:56.498 --> 47:59.917
It's unfair but I do.

48:01.044 --> 48:03.921
I don't like being disappointed.

48:04.172 --> 48:08.050
And you took me by surprise...

48:08.844 --> 48:12.763
okay, took me by surprise with your attention.

48:15.309 --> 48:16.809
Okay?

48:18.228 --> 48:19.854
Alright.

48:21.315 --> 48:22.690
Okay.

48:25.193 --> 48:28.404
We could meet up Saturday night if you want.

48:29.698 --> 48:31.532
I'd like that.

48:34.995 --> 48:37.705
I haven't told anyone what l'm having.

48:38.540 --> 48:40.374
I'm having a boy.

48:40.584 --> 48:42.251
Is that what you guys want?

48:42.836 --> 48:44.837
Joseph wants a boy.

48:45.213 --> 48:46.964
And you?

48:49.009 --> 48:51.344
I'm happy either way.

48:51.511 --> 48:53.429
If you were having a baby yourself...

48:53.597 --> 48:57.266
a baby of your own, you'd want a boy or girl?

48:57.809 --> 48:59.310
A girl.

49:01.730 --> 49:03.856
Do you always tell the truth?

49:04.358 --> 49:07.068
The truth is easier to remember.

49:10.030 --> 49:11.739
Okay.

49:12.407 --> 49:14.408
This is what l want.

49:14.618 --> 49:18.079
I want to visit your house
and see how you guys live.

49:18.455 --> 49:21.207
I wanna spend a couple nights there.

49:21.500 --> 49:25.294
I wanna meet your parents and your friends.

49:25.504 --> 49:28.172
That doesn't have to be all in one go.

49:28.382 --> 49:31.717
And I don't have to interview them
or be interrogated.

49:32.302 --> 49:33.594
After that I'll decide.

49:33.929 --> 49:34.595
If l think we're a good match,

49:34.930 --> 49:37.181
I want you to come to birthing class with me.

49:37.349 --> 49:39.225
But not your husband.

49:39.434 --> 49:42.895
I don't want him at the birth, either.
Just you.

49:43.563 --> 49:46.816
And I wanna be able to name the baby myself.

49:48.568 --> 49:51.612
After that, it's goodbye.

49:52.364 --> 49:54.281
That's the deal.

49:56.076 --> 49:57.451
Okay.

50:17.889 --> 50:19.432
What are you doing?

50:19.599 --> 50:20.433
Get down.

50:20.767 --> 50:22.435
You're gonna kill yourself.

50:36.533 --> 50:39.869
Here you go. Take one, you little thief.

50:41.079 --> 50:42.997
Go 'head, take it.

50:46.918 --> 50:48.627
Take it.

51:15.447 --> 51:16.447
What is this?

51:16.656 --> 51:18.240
What the hell is she doing with this necklace?

51:18.533 --> 51:19.241
You're hurting her, Karen.

51:19.534 --> 51:20.910
What the hell is she doing with this?

51:21.244 --> 51:22.912
You are hurting her, Karen.

51:23.163 --> 51:24.413
Let her go.

51:24.706 --> 51:26.165
What the hell is she doing with this?

51:26.500 --> 51:27.583
Your mother gave it to her.

51:27.834 --> 51:28.709
She did not.

51:28.960 --> 51:30.461
For her birthday.

51:31.421 --> 51:34.757
This belonged to her mother.
She did not give it to you.

51:34.966 --> 51:35.883
She did.

51:36.051 --> 51:40.471
Your mother was a very generous person.
She was a wonderful woman.

51:49.564 --> 51:51.273
Turn that thing off.

51:57.906 --> 52:00.157
Well what else did she give you?

52:00.575 --> 52:02.201
A photo of herself.

52:02.369 --> 52:03.035
Why?

52:03.328 --> 52:04.829
Because I asked her for it.

52:05.163 --> 52:06.413
Why is this upsetting you, Karen?

52:06.706 --> 52:07.832
l'm not upset.

52:09.042 --> 52:12.920
I'm just trying to figure out
what's going on in my own house.

52:21.012 --> 52:23.764
Did my mother ever talk to you about me?

52:25.642 --> 52:27.393
Sometimes.

52:27.853 --> 52:29.937
What did she say?

52:33.191 --> 52:36.026
What the hell did she say?

52:36.653 --> 52:38.988
She said you were not happy.

52:40.907 --> 52:42.616
She said that?

52:45.912 --> 52:47.997
What were her words?

52:48.248 --> 52:53.377
I can't remember her exact words,
but she blamed herself.

53:00.719 --> 53:03.095
Did she tell you what happened?

53:05.098 --> 53:07.808
She said she had ruined your life.

53:08.226 --> 53:11.729
And that she was very sorry for that.

53:24.784 --> 53:27.703
Why didn't she say that to me?

53:29.873 --> 53:33.834
Why the hell didn't she say that to me?

53:34.544 --> 53:37.171
Why did she say it to you?

53:39.382 --> 53:42.635
She had to say it to me.

53:43.470 --> 53:45.888
I think she was scared of you, Karen.

53:53.188 --> 53:54.563
Hello. l'm Dr. Stone.

53:54.773 --> 53:56.273
- Hi.
- Hi.

53:56.608 --> 53:59.026
So you are Elizabeth Joyce.

53:59.194 --> 54:00.361
Who referred you?

54:00.570 --> 54:03.364
You're on a list of doctors who consult
for Walsh, Connery and Lewis.

54:03.740 --> 54:05.282
I'm one of their attorneys.

54:05.659 --> 54:07.368
You do look familiar, though.

54:07.786 --> 54:09.328
We've never met.

54:09.913 --> 54:11.622
What can l do for you?

54:11.873 --> 54:13.749
I'm a month late with my period.

54:14.084 --> 54:16.293
- Are you sexually active?
- I'm not pregnant.

54:16.586 --> 54:17.670
What form of birth control do you use?

54:18.004 --> 54:19.672
My tubes are tied.

54:20.423 --> 54:21.799
How long have they been tied?

54:22.008 --> 54:23.550
Since I was 17.

54:23.760 --> 54:25.052
That's unusual.

54:25.428 --> 54:27.346
It's not a procedure normally done on minors,

54:27.681 --> 54:29.348
except for medical reasons.

54:29.641 --> 54:31.558
I had it done across the border.

54:31.768 --> 54:33.727
They didn't know I was a minor.

54:37.232 --> 54:38.565
Any other symptoms? Abdominal pain?

54:38.817 --> 54:39.817
Cramps? Fever?

54:39.943 --> 54:41.610
- No.
- No?

54:42.779 --> 54:45.030
Let's take a look at you.

54:53.665 --> 54:56.041
Were you at USC Law?

54:56.501 --> 54:57.668
I have met you.

54:57.877 --> 55:00.421
I'm friends with Sophie Sparrow
and Nina Marshall.

55:00.714 --> 55:02.214
You used to live next door to them.

55:02.590 --> 55:03.549
We never actually talked.

55:03.758 --> 55:07.511
You were, you were a little intimidating.

55:08.888 --> 55:09.972
What's wrong?

55:10.265 --> 55:12.391
You know,
I don't appreciate looking back on my life

55:12.767 --> 55:15.060
with someone l've known for two minutes.

55:15.395 --> 55:18.188
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by that.

55:18.356 --> 55:23.277
I'm so sorry.
That was unprofessional, and bad timing.

55:23.570 --> 55:26.071
I don't presume to know anything about you.

55:27.282 --> 55:29.241
Please forgive me.

55:58.438 --> 55:59.855
Okay.

56:01.566 --> 56:06.528
I'll have the nurse get a blood sample
and a smear and...

56:08.490 --> 56:12.284
You could be pregnant. lt's not impossible.

56:30.095 --> 56:31.553
I'm done, Karen.

56:31.805 --> 56:33.347
I'll see you next week.

56:47.946 --> 56:49.530
Thank you.

57:01.793 --> 57:03.085
Thanks.

57:05.547 --> 57:07.089
Have a seat.

57:16.057 --> 57:19.059
Have you ever looked
for your biological parents?

57:22.897 --> 57:24.314
No.

57:25.024 --> 57:27.109
They might be looking for you.

57:27.318 --> 57:29.069
There is no they.

57:30.155 --> 57:33.240
Father's not part of my imagination.

57:37.537 --> 57:39.788
I live in her hometown.

57:39.956 --> 57:43.667
How hard can it be for Her Fucking Majesty
to find me?

57:46.754 --> 57:48.422
It's better this way.

57:48.631 --> 57:50.632
We're all better off like this.

57:50.884 --> 57:52.426
Why do you ask?

57:52.760 --> 57:56.763
I thought she'd be very pleased
with who you are.

58:11.571 --> 58:15.407
Spending time with you away
from work is delightful.

58:15.700 --> 58:18.076
It's more than delightful. ln fact...

58:18.411 --> 58:22.748
since you landed here,
I can't tell if l'm coming or going.

58:23.208 --> 58:25.459
You want what you want.

58:26.211 --> 58:28.212
And I like that.

58:28.838 --> 58:33.300
In fact your willfulness
is a great part of your charm.

58:34.636 --> 58:39.556
But it's getting a little scary for me,
having these feelings.

58:41.100 --> 58:43.852
I'm going to have to bow out.

58:47.440 --> 58:51.235
You don't seem like a man
who's scared by scary things.

58:54.822 --> 58:56.448
It's precaution.

59:00.662 --> 59:05.499
Sometimes when you fall, it's hard to get up.

59:46.958 --> 59:48.458
Hi.

59:49.836 --> 59:51.753
Am I early, 'cause...

59:51.963 --> 59:56.425
No. No, it- that... lt's fine.

59:57.510 --> 59:59.720
Look, l'm sorry.

01:00:00.054 --> 01:00:02.055
It's not a good time for me.

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:05.017
I don't think l can...

01:00:07.478 --> 01:00:09.021
Really?

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:38.425
I thought maybe we'd go over to
the Shadow Grill in Burbank.

01:00:38.593 --> 01:00:41.970
Look, l wanna say something to you.

01:00:48.936 --> 01:00:53.815
I had a baby girl when I was 14.

01:00:54.108 --> 01:00:59.488
And she was given up for adoption.

01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:07.788
I don't know where she is.

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:11.208
I don't know who she is.

01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:15.796
Everything I do...

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:21.968
every thought in my head takes me back to her.

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:25.597
Everywhere l go...

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:29.601
I look for her face in the crowd.

01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:37.317
I write her letters that I never send...

01:01:37.568 --> 01:01:41.154
and l buy her birthday gifts.

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:45.075
I have a name for her, Rachel.

01:01:45.618 --> 01:01:49.496
I don't know if she's dead or alive.

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:59.005
I have nothing else.

01:02:00.258 --> 01:02:02.259
That's who I am.

01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:06.680
I have nothing to give.

01:02:29.787 --> 01:02:32.497
Where on earth did you come from?

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:40.297
Hello Elizabeth. How are you?

01:02:40.465 --> 01:02:41.923
You tell me.

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:46.219
Well, you are pregnant.

01:02:46.554 --> 01:02:50.182
It happens rarely with tied tubes but,
it does happen.

01:02:50.391 --> 01:02:52.434
So, you can talk to the girls up front
about coming in

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:54.102
and we'll take care of it.

01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:58.732
And then we can talk about other forms
of birth control. Okay?

01:03:15.833 --> 01:03:17.000
Hi.

01:03:22.590 --> 01:03:24.174
What's going on?

01:03:26.552 --> 01:03:30.889
You don't know who l am
or what I want, you cunt.

01:03:34.519 --> 01:03:35.894
How old is she?

01:03:38.189 --> 01:03:40.357
She's already a senior in college.

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:43.652
And, she's had all of her medical tests
and everything?

01:03:43.945 --> 01:03:46.947
Okay. You are putting me in a bad mood.

01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:51.159
So when do l get to meet her?

01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:52.702
Never.

01:03:55.665 --> 01:03:58.792
I bet if l met her,
I'd be able to see right through her.

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:01.795
What? Regarding what?

01:04:02.213 --> 01:04:04.089
Whatever it is she's playing at.

01:04:04.423 --> 01:04:05.674
English, please.

01:04:05.883 --> 01:04:07.717
- l don't think this little girl's
on the up-and-up.

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:08.468
Okay, wait... What...

01:04:08.803 --> 01:04:10.095
- l really...
- Why-why...

01:04:10.429 --> 01:04:12.556
You always do that.

01:04:13.808 --> 01:04:15.308
What?

01:04:15.476 --> 01:04:17.394
She's great, Mom.

01:04:40.835 --> 01:04:42.168
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:04:42.503 --> 01:04:43.587
I'm looking for Paul.

01:04:43.838 --> 01:04:45.297
Is he expecting you?

01:04:46.048 --> 01:04:49.593
I'm from the office. Elizabeth.

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:54.097
Oh. Sure. l'm Maria, Paul's daughter.

01:04:55.057 --> 01:04:56.266
Hi.

01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:58.935
- Come in.
- lt's okay.

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:01.980
Well you can't just stand there. Come on.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:09.571
Hey you guys, everyone! Everyone!

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:11.948
This is Elizabeth from Dad's office.

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:13.074
How you doing?

01:05:13.534 --> 01:05:16.953
- Hello, Elizabeth.
- Have a seat, please.

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:18.413
- lt's okay.
- No, sit down.

01:05:18.664 --> 01:05:19.873
He'll be right off.

01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:21.226
Hey.

01:06:23.896 --> 01:06:25.021
Is everything all right?

01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:26.231
Yeah.

01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:28.066
This is a nice party.

01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:29.901
Stay. Have dinner with us.

01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.944
I can't.

01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:32.445
Sure you can.

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:37.534
No. l can't.

01:06:40.287 --> 01:06:42.205
What's going on?

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.960
I'm leaving in the morning.

01:06:47.211 --> 01:06:48.837
Leaving, for where?

01:06:51.757 --> 01:06:53.591
Leaving.

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:00.056
What happened?

01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:04.769
Is it something l did,
or something l did not do?

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:11.109
The wind changed.

01:07:13.154 --> 01:07:15.572
Is that it?

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:51.584
Score that goal!

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.712
Ah, thanks, mija.

01:08:54.921 --> 01:08:56.965
Karen, you want white or dark?

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:58.591
Oh thanks, I'll do it.

01:08:58.884 --> 01:09:01.426
No. l want to.

01:09:03.514 --> 01:09:05.098
Okay. White.

01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:08.268
I'm not used to this.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:11.187
This is how l want it to be between us.

01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:21.906
I'm always rushing to eat, like a hog.

01:09:22.073 --> 01:09:23.448
Oh, no.

01:09:23.658 --> 01:09:26.202
You got yourself confused with my dad.

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:29.455
Has he told you that
he doesn't believe in God?

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:34.586
The most kind-hearted man
in the world has turned his back on Jesus.

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:37.839
Jesus wouldn't turn his back on you, Dad.

01:09:40.216 --> 01:09:42.719
Okay. Okay, l'll stop.

01:09:43.304 --> 01:09:46.639
One day we'll be in heaven,
laughing at these arguments.

01:09:46.974 --> 01:09:49.559
I'll tell you something.
If l'm in heaven, l won't be laughing.

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:52.687
Somebody's gonna have
a lot of explaining to do.

01:09:54.481 --> 01:09:56.316
Karen, you're a good woman.

01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:59.152
You must feel the love of Mary in your heart.

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:07.785
My dad has told me about your loss.

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:11.414
She doesn't really like talking about that.

01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:15.585
Sometimes it's hard
to understand God's design.

01:10:15.753 --> 01:10:17.295
Melissa.

01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:21.758
May I speak?

01:10:23.677 --> 01:10:25.845
You're my father's wife now.

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:30.350
My children will grow to know you
as their grandmother...

01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:35.897
because it's the time spent together
that counts, more than blood.

01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:39.609
Time counts the most.

01:10:40.402 --> 01:10:41.903
Find her now...

01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:44.155
before time runs out.

01:10:44.406 --> 01:10:48.451
After that, only regret remains.

01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:50.828
And regret is a killer.

01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:55.875
Well, Elizabeth...

01:10:56.168 --> 01:11:00.797
to say that you are grossly overqualified
is putting it mildly.

01:11:01.006 --> 01:11:06.219
I can't possibly afford anyone like you,
though l'd like to. Believe me.

01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:08.304
I don't care about the money.

01:11:08.514 --> 01:11:10.723
I can't even give you benefits.

01:11:10.975 --> 01:11:12.225
I'm not looking for them.

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:14.811
I've got plenty of my own insurance.

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:19.065
Do you know what you're having?

01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:22.110
A girl.

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:24.195
What are your alternatives?

01:11:24.446 --> 01:11:28.074
If you didn't get this job, what would you do?

01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:31.369
Stay at home and watch game shows.

01:11:31.829 --> 01:11:33.538
Okay.

01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:36.165
I don't know what to make of you.

01:11:37.209 --> 01:11:39.544
I'm just passing through.

01:11:43.882 --> 01:11:47.385
What do you think about what Melissa said?

01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:50.179
I actually agree with her.

01:11:51.265 --> 01:11:53.683
I think you should look for her.

01:11:54.768 --> 01:11:56.436
Why?

01:11:58.230 --> 01:12:00.606
Because whatever happens when you meet her,
Karen...

01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:08.823
it'll be easier than this thing
that's eating away at you.

01:12:10.868 --> 01:12:12.994
Why haven't you told me this before?

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:15.830
I was working my way towards it.

01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:22.628
She might be out there looking for you.

01:12:22.963 --> 01:12:24.714
Have you thought about that?

01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:32.013
There's nothing that l haven't thought of.

01:12:32.806 --> 01:12:34.849
You'd know where to start?

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:40.772
So, what's your biggest fear?

01:12:42.441 --> 01:12:46.194
That she'll spit in my face.

01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:53.201
You delivered on November 7th, 1973.

01:12:53.327 --> 01:12:55.995
Your mother was the legal guardian
of the baby.

01:12:56.413 --> 01:12:59.624
You agreed to that before she was born.

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:03.836
And a couple adopted the baby
on November 10th.

01:13:04.254 --> 01:13:05.630
Unfortunately...

01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:09.842
the provisions of the adoption don't allow me
to give out any information...

01:13:10.094 --> 01:13:13.846
regarding the identity
of the parties involved.

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:17.850
What you can do is write a letter to her.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.602
The letter will be kept in the file.

01:13:19.853 --> 01:13:23.356
And if she were ever to contact us,
we would give her the letter...

01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:28.027
and she would be free to reach out
to you directly.

01:13:31.365 --> 01:13:36.244
I'm sorry, that is the best l can do.

01:13:38.539 --> 01:13:42.208
Oh, so, if she had been here,
she would've been told the same thing.

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:43.835
That's right.

01:13:44.044 --> 01:13:47.922
So, if she was here,
she didn't leave me a letter.

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:50.550
Well, there's no letter in the file.

01:13:50.884 --> 01:13:52.093
So...

01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:54.679
she's either not looking...

01:13:54.888 --> 01:13:58.891
or she didn't want to write a letter...

01:13:59.184 --> 01:14:01.561
or she thinks l'm not looking for her.

01:14:01.895 --> 01:14:04.188
Maybe she doesn't know where to look.

01:14:04.398 --> 01:14:06.774
Well l really encourage you
to write a letter...

01:14:07.025 --> 01:14:08.943
because it works.

01:14:09.236 --> 01:14:11.404
People find each other.

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:14.991
I have seen it many times.

01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:27.086
Anything to report?

01:14:28.172 --> 01:14:30.923
I had a little spotting last week.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.384
And some again yesterday.

01:14:35.262 --> 01:14:37.430
Is the baby moving regularly?

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:39.932
Yes.

01:14:41.226 --> 01:14:44.437
Let's do an ultrasound
and get some blood work.

01:15:18.263 --> 01:15:19.680
Who's there?

01:15:20.307 --> 01:15:21.933
I'm a tenant.

01:15:22.267 --> 01:15:24.477
I was just getting some sun.

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:26.270
I'm Violet.

01:15:27.731 --> 01:15:29.315
Elizabeth.

01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:31.317
How old are you?

01:15:32.319 --> 01:15:33.653
I'm 37.

01:15:35.322 --> 01:15:38.574
Free to come and go as you please.
You lucky dog.

01:15:39.618 --> 01:15:41.410
What do you do for a living?

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:42.620
I'm a lawyer.

01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:44.330
The law.

01:15:44.498 --> 01:15:46.999
Not a big field for the blind.

01:15:47.292 --> 01:15:49.502
My mother wants me to be in radio.

01:15:49.795 --> 01:15:52.213
She says l have the voice for it.

01:15:52.631 --> 01:15:57.593
It's just her fear talking,
that l won't be able to make my way.

01:15:57.844 --> 01:15:59.512
Does radio interest you?

01:15:59.805 --> 01:16:02.515
I don't know. l don't know what interests me.

01:16:03.517 --> 01:16:07.520
Sometimes l tell her
I could have a career in phone sex.

01:16:07.938 --> 01:16:10.064
She's humorless.

01:16:10.649 --> 01:16:12.608
Do you know anyone else in the building?

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:14.485
No.

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:18.531
Oh. I'm always here in the afternoons.

01:16:18.949 --> 01:16:20.992
Meet me here if you're lonely.

01:16:21.618 --> 01:16:22.868
Okay.

01:16:24.204 --> 01:16:26.080
I'll see you around.

01:16:28.542 --> 01:16:30.543
Goodbye Elizabeth.

01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:32.837
Count on me.

01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:52.750
- l'm gonna put you back there, okay?
- Okay.

01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:56.837
- And we have more sizes, anyway.
- Thank you.

01:18:03.261 --> 01:18:04.637
Hey.

01:18:06.556 --> 01:18:10.434
Hey. My grandbaby's in the house.

01:18:11.311 --> 01:18:12.978
So what you gonna name him?

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:14.939
I'm not naming him, they are.

01:18:16.942 --> 01:18:19.193
Sebastian.

01:18:19.736 --> 01:18:22.947
That's what l was gonna name you
if you had been a boy.

01:18:23.573 --> 01:18:24.907
Why do you do that?

01:18:25.617 --> 01:18:27.076
Do what, baby?

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:30.246
- lgnore my damn wishes.
- Hey, hey.

01:18:31.623 --> 01:18:33.249
Which are?

01:18:33.625 --> 01:18:35.668
You know what the hell they are.

01:18:41.007 --> 01:18:44.260
To give that child away on its birthday?

01:18:45.262 --> 01:18:47.471
To take something...

01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:51.016
that comes from you...

01:18:51.476 --> 01:18:53.394
made of you...

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:56.814
and part with it forever and ever?

01:18:57.023 --> 01:18:58.607
I don't want it.

01:18:59.067 --> 01:19:01.110
I didn't want you either.

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:03.946
I'm not you.

01:19:04.698 --> 01:19:06.615
Here you are.

01:19:06.908 --> 01:19:11.996
Twenty and pregnant and single,
just like l was.

01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:15.875
See, l didn't want you.

01:19:17.836 --> 01:19:19.712
And now...

01:19:19.921 --> 01:19:22.214
I can't take a breath...

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:28.053
without thinking of you
and wanting the best of the best for you.

01:19:34.936 --> 01:19:37.980
- How we doin' back here?
- Good.

01:20:13.266 --> 01:20:14.725
Joseph?

01:20:15.268 --> 01:20:16.685
Hey.

01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:20.940
What're you doing?

01:20:23.068 --> 01:20:24.777
Oh, who's playing?

01:20:29.407 --> 01:20:31.075
You okay?

01:20:32.452 --> 01:20:33.953
Yeah, l was just thinking.

01:20:34.162 --> 01:20:35.663
About what?

01:20:36.706 --> 01:20:41.168
About Ray, what we've gotten ourselves into.

01:20:41.419 --> 01:20:43.671
What have we gotten ourselves into?

01:20:44.548 --> 01:20:46.882
The baby of hers that we're planning to keep.

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:48.634
Planning to keep?

01:20:49.386 --> 01:20:51.804
We're adopting a baby.

01:20:52.055 --> 01:20:54.473
I thought that you were all in for that.

01:20:54.808 --> 01:20:56.183
Well, if not,
how the fuck did we get this far?

01:20:56.476 --> 01:20:59.728
I don't know how we got this far, Lucy.

01:21:01.815 --> 01:21:04.525
I want a child of my own.

01:21:08.822 --> 01:21:11.907
But you know that l can't give you that.

01:21:16.496 --> 01:21:18.539
I wish you could.

01:21:36.099 --> 01:21:39.226
I've never felt so worthless
in my entire life.

01:21:39.352 --> 01:21:41.395
You are not worthless.

01:21:41.646 --> 01:21:44.732
I could hear his mother's voice speaking
through him.

01:21:45.066 --> 01:21:46.942
It was fucking freaky.

01:21:52.866 --> 01:21:54.366
It's over.

01:21:55.035 --> 01:21:56.660
Lucy...

01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:59.872
you're angry, and upset, and you should be.

01:22:00.206 --> 01:22:03.083
But,
you guys need to talk about this some more.

01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:05.711
No.

01:22:05.879 --> 01:22:08.255
I can do this on my own.

01:22:09.174 --> 01:22:12.551
Ray won't mind. She doesn't even like Joseph.

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:13.677
She doesn't?

01:22:13.845 --> 01:22:15.429
No.

01:22:17.265 --> 01:22:20.392
She hasn't said anything, but I can tell.

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:30.402
You need to think why you're adopting
this baby in the first place.

01:22:32.155 --> 01:22:34.573
Why am I adopting this baby?

01:22:35.075 --> 01:22:36.909
It's for Joseph.

01:22:37.410 --> 01:22:39.620
That's bullshit.

01:22:40.038 --> 01:22:42.206
That's my baby.

01:22:42.374 --> 01:22:45.542
I have made a commitment
and l'm gonna stick to it.

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:49.672
Mom, this is not like shopping
for a pair of shoes. She's my baby.

01:22:49.923 --> 01:22:53.258
She is my baby.

01:22:54.052 --> 01:22:56.637
And nobody dared to go back to
Chew-And-Swallow

01:22:57.013 --> 01:22:58.222
to find out what had happened to it.

01:22:58.598 --> 01:22:59.932
They were too afraid.

01:23:00.183 --> 01:23:03.644
Henry and l were awake until the very end of
Grandpa's story.

01:23:03.937 --> 01:23:06.105
I remember his good night kiss.

01:23:06.314 --> 01:23:07.815
Okay Cristi, it's time to go.

01:23:07.941 --> 01:23:09.441
Already?

01:23:10.694 --> 01:23:12.778
Well we'll finish them next week, okay?

01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:14.321
Use the bathroom before we leave.

01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:17.533
Oh, here, use this one here. Okay?

01:23:21.037 --> 01:23:23.247
How's she doing in school?

01:23:23.456 --> 01:23:25.624
Good. She likes it.

01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:33.590
Could l ask you a question?

01:23:35.969 --> 01:23:41.181
Aren't you ever afraid that something could-

01:23:41.933 --> 01:23:45.602
I don't know, that she could...

01:23:47.313 --> 01:23:50.065
Fall and break like an egg?

01:23:50.442 --> 01:23:52.109
Sometimes.

01:23:52.986 --> 01:23:55.154
How do you live with that?

01:23:57.991 --> 01:23:59.658
Gotta go.

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:00.909
Bye-bye, Karen.

01:24:02.912 --> 01:24:04.580
Hello, Elizabeth.

01:24:04.748 --> 01:24:08.000
Well, you have what is known
as placenta previa.

01:24:08.293 --> 01:24:11.628
Your placenta lies low under the baby...

01:24:11.838 --> 01:24:13.756
partially blocking the cervix.

01:24:14.007 --> 01:24:17.259
We might have to consider a C-section.

01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:19.762
Maybe even before term.

01:24:20.096 --> 01:24:21.597
No.

01:24:21.848 --> 01:24:23.640
I'm gonna deliver her.

01:24:23.808 --> 01:24:25.559
Well we're not there, yet.

01:24:25.852 --> 01:24:27.311
I mean it, Doctor.

01:24:27.645 --> 01:24:29.480
I'm gonna push her out myself.

01:24:30.315 --> 01:24:32.107
Is that clear?

01:24:34.027 --> 01:24:35.778
Let me take a look.

01:24:36.571 --> 01:24:39.865
Has anybody in your family ever
had a bleeding disorder?

01:24:41.868 --> 01:24:45.871
From now on, please try not to
exert yourself, okay?

01:24:46.498 --> 01:24:49.333
Otherwise l'll put you on bed rest.

01:25:21.866 --> 01:25:23.909
I'm Paul's daughter.

01:25:24.744 --> 01:25:26.328
Yes.

01:25:26.538 --> 01:25:28.080
Maria.

01:25:29.874 --> 01:25:31.708
How's Paul?

01:25:31.918 --> 01:25:33.710
He's good.

01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:38.423
Is that his?

01:25:40.093 --> 01:25:41.927
No.

01:26:32.729 --> 01:26:34.229
Karen...

01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:37.608
my brother is opening a restaurant
in Corpus Christi, Texas.

01:26:38.902 --> 01:26:39.943
That's great.

01:26:40.278 --> 01:26:41.153
Yeah.

01:26:41.404 --> 01:26:42.988
He wants me to move out there...

01:26:43.531 --> 01:26:45.240
to be his cashier.

01:26:46.326 --> 01:26:47.701
Do you want to?

01:26:50.413 --> 01:26:52.789
It's a good opportunity for us.

01:26:54.167 --> 01:26:55.709
You know?

01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:04.968
Your money or your life.

01:27:05.595 --> 01:27:06.887
Hello, Violet.

01:27:09.557 --> 01:27:10.849
How are you?

01:27:11.601 --> 01:27:13.268
Are you married?

01:27:13.394 --> 01:27:16.521
You must be, otherwise you wouldn't be
hiding out here so often.

01:27:17.315 --> 01:27:18.732
I'm not married.

01:27:18.942 --> 01:27:20.567
Hiding from your children?

01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:22.694
No children yet.

01:27:22.904 --> 01:27:25.989
Smart move.
I've heard they're a disappointment.

01:27:27.825 --> 01:27:29.701
Actually l'm pregnant.

01:27:29.869 --> 01:27:31.536
Really?

01:27:44.759 --> 01:27:47.928
A person inside another person.

01:27:48.513 --> 01:27:50.639
Science fiction.

01:27:52.517 --> 01:27:54.017
She doesn't know a thing.

01:27:54.227 --> 01:27:55.227
Who?

01:27:55.436 --> 01:27:57.104
Your baby.

01:27:57.939 --> 01:27:59.773
Only her mother's heartbeat.

01:28:02.193 --> 01:28:04.403
That should be enough for now.

01:28:14.622 --> 01:28:16.665
You're easy to talk to.

01:28:16.833 --> 01:28:18.500
So are you.

01:28:21.796 --> 01:28:23.755
Can't talk to my mother.

01:28:25.591 --> 01:28:26.883
Why not?

01:28:27.093 --> 01:28:30.762
She's so scared for me,
it scares the shit out of me.

01:28:32.724 --> 01:28:34.891
What's your mother like?

01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:40.689
She's great.

01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:44.276
She's patient and gentle.

01:28:44.527 --> 01:28:45.944
She's really fun.

01:28:46.195 --> 01:28:48.655
Wow.

01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:52.701
The truth is l have no idea.

01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:55.704
She gave me up for adoption when l was born.

01:28:56.039 --> 01:28:57.831
We've never met.

01:29:00.043 --> 01:29:04.880
For the longest time
I could only think of her as a girl of 14.

01:29:06.257 --> 01:29:10.302
That's how old she was when she had me.

01:29:13.931 --> 01:29:15.766
She was like you.

01:29:15.975 --> 01:29:17.976
But not a virgin.

01:29:18.895 --> 01:29:22.439
That's right, not a virgin.

01:29:23.649 --> 01:29:25.567
Are you angry at her?

01:29:26.069 --> 01:29:29.654
No. Not anymore. l used to be.

01:29:29.864 --> 01:29:32.324
I don't know what happened, but...

01:29:34.327 --> 01:29:39.664
all that anger just washed out of me.

01:29:40.458 --> 01:29:43.168
So then why not look for her?

01:29:43.336 --> 01:29:46.213
Yeah, l would.

01:29:47.173 --> 01:29:49.341
What would you say to her?

01:29:50.093 --> 01:29:52.302
Nothing.

01:29:52.595 --> 01:29:54.763
I wouldn't say anything.

01:29:55.264 --> 01:29:57.265
I would just sit with her...

01:29:57.517 --> 01:29:59.976
like we're sitting here right now.

01:31:19.265 --> 01:31:21.725
I don't want to impose myself on you.

01:31:21.976 --> 01:31:24.227
I don't want to be a nuisance.

01:31:25.271 --> 01:31:30.567
I am pregnant and I'd like my baby
to know where she comes from.

01:31:31.027 --> 01:31:33.195
I live in Los Angeles.

01:31:33.404 --> 01:31:37.866
I'm successful in my work
and financially independent.

01:31:38.034 --> 01:31:40.452
I am open to sharing more about myself,

01:31:40.786 --> 01:31:42.412
and if you are open to that as well...

01:31:42.747 --> 01:31:44.539
it would be welcome.

01:31:45.249 --> 01:31:47.209
If you don't want to communicate with me,

01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:50.670
I will also understand and accept it.

01:31:54.967 --> 01:32:00.180
If we were to meet,
I think we should look forward, not back...

01:32:00.598 --> 01:32:02.724
and build something new.

01:32:07.313 --> 01:32:11.191
I was born November 7th, 1973.

01:32:13.277 --> 01:32:16.279
My name is Elizabeth.

01:32:19.951 --> 01:32:22.160
I think of you often.

01:32:34.507 --> 01:32:35.924
That's it.

01:32:48.271 --> 01:32:49.437
Hello.

01:32:49.689 --> 01:32:51.314
Oh, Linda.

01:32:51.524 --> 01:32:54.943
Thanks for- thanks for returning my call.

01:32:55.194 --> 01:32:55.944
Yeah.

01:32:58.906 --> 01:33:00.407
How are ya, Karen?

01:33:00.533 --> 01:33:03.243
- l'm good.
- Good.

01:33:08.791 --> 01:33:11.960
I'll put it in the file right away.

01:33:20.219 --> 01:33:22.095
I'll do it right now.

01:33:58.299 --> 01:34:01.343
I met someone three months ago.

01:34:01.552 --> 01:34:07.265
She's caring, smart, good for me.

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:10.727
We're talking about moving back east.

01:34:11.604 --> 01:34:15.106
But if that's my child you're carrying...

01:34:15.316 --> 01:34:18.443
I'm going to say goodbye to all that.

01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:22.322
I want you to come back and be with me.

01:34:22.615 --> 01:34:24.741
You can put down roots here...

01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:29.079
I'll stay with the firm,
I'll pave your way to the top.

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:33.166
You're what l want.

01:34:33.876 --> 01:34:36.294
I'll take care of you.

01:34:36.879 --> 01:34:39.255
Both of you.

01:34:40.383 --> 01:34:42.967
I'll never leave.

01:37:05.194 --> 01:37:06.611
All set.

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:09.489
How we doin', here?

01:37:10.533 --> 01:37:11.908
I'm scared.

01:37:12.243 --> 01:37:13.785
You're bleeding.

01:37:14.078 --> 01:37:17.539
That may be causing the baby
a bit of distress.

01:37:17.998 --> 01:37:20.792
I want to see her when she's born.

01:37:22.378 --> 01:37:24.212
Don't knock me out.

01:37:49.071 --> 01:37:50.530
Okay.

01:37:53.409 --> 01:37:55.827
Loss of pressure.

01:38:01.166 --> 01:38:03.084
Hello.

01:38:07.047 --> 01:38:09.549
Happy Birthday, baby.

01:38:17.391 --> 01:38:19.100
There ya go.

01:38:54.303 --> 01:38:56.429
She's bleeding again.

01:38:56.639 --> 01:38:58.389
Give her O-2.

01:38:58.557 --> 01:39:00.224
Open her up.

01:39:01.810 --> 01:39:03.895
The lines are wide open.

01:39:04.021 --> 01:39:05.897
Four units.

01:40:12.548 --> 01:40:14.507
It's okay. It's okay.

01:40:17.636 --> 01:40:18.845
- Hello.
- Good morning.

01:40:19.179 --> 01:40:20.221
Good morning.

01:40:20.431 --> 01:40:22.223
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:40:22.474 --> 01:40:24.225
Has your milk come in yet?

01:40:24.935 --> 01:40:27.729
Oh, we should just put him on the breast.
It'll stimulate it.

01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:29.897
No, l'm not nursing him.

01:40:30.190 --> 01:40:32.817
Oh, okay.
Have you talked to your doctor about this?

01:40:33.235 --> 01:40:34.444
I don't have to.

01:40:37.281 --> 01:40:37.947
Thank you.

01:40:57.217 --> 01:41:01.095
Yeah.

01:42:09.832 --> 01:42:11.749
Hi. I want to speak to you.

01:42:23.887 --> 01:42:29.851
No, what do you want from me? No. Oh, god.

01:42:30.686 --> 01:42:34.313
Oh, hold up.

01:42:45.367 --> 01:42:48.327
My fucking baby! That is my baby!

01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:49.537
Please...

01:42:49.872 --> 01:42:51.247
- No, that's my baby!
- Come on, now.

01:42:51.456 --> 01:42:52.540
It's mine!

01:42:52.749 --> 01:42:57.503
Let her go. Let her go! Let her go!

01:43:02.092 --> 01:43:05.136
Sh, sh, sh. Come on, come on.

01:43:05.512 --> 01:43:08.431
- That's my fucking baby!
- Miss...

01:43:08.682 --> 01:43:10.433
Please. Please, Ray!

01:43:10.767 --> 01:43:16.439
I'm gonna be so...

01:43:16.773 --> 01:43:20.693
I'm gonna be so

01:43:27.993 --> 01:43:30.411
You were right.

01:43:30.621 --> 01:43:31.996
If God wanted me to be a mother,

01:43:32.456 --> 01:43:33.748
He would've made me a mother.

01:43:33.957 --> 01:43:36.959
Oh Lucy, l never said that.

01:43:37.169 --> 01:43:40.087
The adoption thing is just so unnatural.

01:43:40.464 --> 01:43:43.382
Why doesn't anybody just say it?

01:43:53.435 --> 01:43:54.894
Ada, may l come in?

01:43:55.187 --> 01:43:57.271
- Please.
- Thank you.

01:43:57.564 --> 01:43:58.564
Lucy...

01:43:58.857 --> 01:44:00.399
I don't blame her.

01:44:00.776 --> 01:44:04.820
What mother would give up her child
when she doesn't have to?

01:44:12.162 --> 01:44:15.915
Lucy, there's another baby.

01:44:16.333 --> 01:44:16.958
Oh for god's sake.

01:44:17.376 --> 01:44:19.293
- Now just hear me out.
- No.

01:44:19.753 --> 01:44:21.587
It's a baby girl.

01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:22.922
Now she has no one.

01:44:23.173 --> 01:44:26.175
Until that no one comes knocking
on our door to take her away.

01:44:26.385 --> 01:44:28.386
- That's not going to happen.
- l think you'd better leave.

01:44:28.512 --> 01:44:30.471
Mom.

01:44:31.223 --> 01:44:33.224
Is this baby intended for somebody else?

01:44:33.392 --> 01:44:36.352
No. Absolutely not.

01:44:36.561 --> 01:44:40.064
Now there are waiting lists, but, look...

01:44:40.315 --> 01:44:44.026
it's already arranged, if you want it.

01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:49.740
Where's the mother?

01:44:49.992 --> 01:44:52.660
There is no one.

01:44:53.203 --> 01:44:55.871
There isn't, okay?

01:44:56.164 --> 01:45:02.169
Sometimes there is just nobody,
and this is one of those times.

01:45:04.589 --> 01:45:06.465
Lucy...

01:45:06.675 --> 01:45:08.759
this little girl...

01:45:09.219 --> 01:45:12.930
you're crossing paths with her today.

01:45:13.223 --> 01:45:18.269
If you let it pass, it will be gone forever.

01:45:27.529 --> 01:45:29.280
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:45:29.698 --> 01:45:34.744
Okay, okay.

01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:05.858
She's down.

01:46:06.276 --> 01:46:07.985
That won't last.

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:12.531
Maybe not. Let's wait and see.

01:46:13.867 --> 01:46:17.578
Mom, what am l gonna do? I can't do this.

01:46:17.829 --> 01:46:19.705
It'll pass.

01:46:20.999 --> 01:46:23.209
I don't love her.

01:46:24.294 --> 01:46:26.337
Yes you do.

01:46:26.588 --> 01:46:29.048
It's lack of sleep, girl.

01:46:29.299 --> 01:46:31.300
You shouldn't... You're not yourself.

01:46:31.510 --> 01:46:32.426
When she's...

01:46:32.677 --> 01:46:36.472
She's like this thing,
she's this creature in my bed...

01:46:36.723 --> 01:46:38.933
and oh, l'm so angry at her.

01:46:39.184 --> 01:46:40.059
For what?

01:46:40.352 --> 01:46:42.353
For taking over everything.

01:46:42.646 --> 01:46:43.771
Day and night.

01:46:44.022 --> 01:46:45.231
It's me, me, me.

01:46:45.482 --> 01:46:47.775
She just wants, feed me,
and clean me, and hold me.

01:46:48.068 --> 01:46:50.111
And I do, and she just cries anyway.

01:46:50.445 --> 01:46:53.447
Who the fuck does she think she is?

01:46:55.659 --> 01:46:58.744
Well l'll be god damned.

01:46:59.913 --> 01:47:04.959
Do you think you're the first woman
who ever had a baby?

01:47:06.545 --> 01:47:09.839
What the hell did you think this was gonna be?

01:47:10.173 --> 01:47:12.842
Stop all the god damn whining...

01:47:13.176 --> 01:47:14.510
grow the fuck up...

01:47:14.845 --> 01:47:17.179
and get your act together.

01:47:18.056 --> 01:47:20.474
Be the mother.

01:47:35.824 --> 01:47:39.577
one year later

01:47:55.302 --> 01:47:58.846
This envelope was found in the files,
no file number on it.

01:47:59.055 --> 01:48:00.347
Thank you.

01:48:00.557 --> 01:48:02.975
- No name, nothing?
- No.

01:48:06.438 --> 01:48:08.439
Oh, I hate to do this.

01:48:17.991 --> 01:48:19.658
We have a birth date.

01:48:19.826 --> 01:48:21.243
Great.

01:48:29.252 --> 01:48:30.794
There it is.

01:48:45.018 --> 01:48:47.019
- See that it gets into the file.
- Will do.

01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:48.437
Thank you.

01:48:57.739 --> 01:48:58.989
Evette.

01:49:05.205 --> 01:49:06.330
Karen...

01:49:06.498 --> 01:49:08.624
thank you so much for coming in.

01:49:08.792 --> 01:49:10.000
What's happening?

01:49:12.087 --> 01:49:14.171
Sit down, please.

01:49:14.965 --> 01:49:16.507
No.

01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:18.634
What's going on?

01:49:20.929 --> 01:49:23.389
This letter is for you.

01:49:25.934 --> 01:49:28.852
- lt's from her?
- Yes.

01:49:29.229 --> 01:49:30.938
Oh.

01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:32.648
Did you meet with her?

01:49:33.108 --> 01:49:35.025
No.

01:49:35.235 --> 01:49:38.904
She must've spoken to one of my coworkers.

01:49:39.239 --> 01:49:43.867
And Karen, l'm afraid it was a while ago.

01:49:44.661 --> 01:49:47.871
The letter was misplaced.

01:49:49.082 --> 01:49:52.751
I'm very sorry about that.

01:49:59.551 --> 01:50:01.385
What?

01:50:13.231 --> 01:50:17.901
She's been dead for over a year.

01:50:19.237 --> 01:50:23.907
There's a daughter, a baby girl.

01:50:24.034 --> 01:50:30.664
And, she was given up for adoption.

01:50:31.166 --> 01:50:33.292
That's it.

01:50:33.501 --> 01:50:35.836
That's the end.

01:50:39.007 --> 01:50:42.468
Why did you make me look?

01:50:43.970 --> 01:50:46.722
Until I found out that she was dead,

01:50:46.973 --> 01:50:49.016
she was alive to me.

01:50:49.351 --> 01:50:53.187
She would be alive to me now.

01:50:59.402 --> 01:51:01.820
Oh, Karen.

01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:55.290
The mother has agreed to let you see her.

01:51:56.167 --> 01:51:58.585
Saturday afternoon.

01:52:01.464 --> 01:52:03.549
Now they've asked me to remind you...

01:52:03.758 --> 01:52:06.760
that you have no legal claim over the baby.

01:52:07.053 --> 01:52:10.264
Now legally Elizabeth was not your child...

01:52:10.473 --> 01:52:14.351
and so you have no claim over her children.

01:52:14.561 --> 01:52:16.979
Also, a good faith effort was made...

01:52:17.272 --> 01:52:21.817
to publish the news of Elizabeth's death,
and to look for her relatives.

01:52:22.152 --> 01:52:23.861
What kind of effort?

01:52:24.195 --> 01:52:27.865
In local newspapers
and on the county web page.

01:52:28.158 --> 01:52:29.950
Nobody came forward.

01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:32.578
Oh.

01:52:34.581 --> 01:52:37.833
Will the child know who I am?

01:52:38.168 --> 01:52:40.878
That's up to the mother.

01:52:41.421 --> 01:52:45.257
Will I be allowed to visit her again,
after this time?

01:52:45.467 --> 01:52:48.802
I don't know. She's not obligated to.

01:52:49.095 --> 01:52:54.099
Don't think about that, Karen.
You'll meet her, you'll see how it goes.

01:52:54.476 --> 01:52:57.186
This is the address.

01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:01.565
And the little girl's name is Ella.

01:53:01.733 --> 01:53:03.317
Oh.

01:55:51.861 --> 01:55:53.987
Can you say bye-bye to Karen?

01:55:59.994 --> 01:56:01.203
Can you say bye-bye?

01:56:01.412 --> 01:56:03.246
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

01:56:03.665 --> 01:56:06.917
Oh, kisses.

01:56:35.697 --> 01:56:37.155
You okay?

01:56:40.952 --> 01:56:42.661
Really?

01:56:43.871 --> 01:56:47.249
She has my mother's eyes.

01:56:48.543 --> 01:56:50.961
That a good thing, or?

01:56:51.921 --> 01:56:54.089
Yes.

01:56:55.842 --> 01:57:00.804
Thank you.

01:57:15.903 --> 01:57:18.071
I never saw you...

01:57:18.740 --> 01:57:20.866
with a new haircut...

01:57:21.075 --> 01:57:23.952
with new shoes.

01:57:24.704 --> 01:57:27.539
When was your first period?

01:57:27.832 --> 01:57:30.417
Was someone there to help?

01:57:30.585 --> 01:57:33.795
Did anyone explain?

01:57:34.547 --> 01:57:39.634
Did you hear the rain one night
when I heard it?

01:57:40.011 --> 01:57:42.929
What gave you comfort?

01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:50.103
I've missed it all, and I've accepted it.

01:57:50.354 --> 01:57:54.524
But today l met Ella.

01:57:55.109 --> 01:57:58.612
Her little face is like a bird...

01:57:58.946 --> 01:58:01.031
that flies high over 38 years...

01:58:01.407 --> 01:58:04.910
that have gone on and on and on...

01:58:05.244 --> 01:58:07.871
like a horrible parade.

01:58:13.878 --> 01:58:17.964
But now it's past.

01:58:19.175 --> 01:58:23.720
Only Ella remains, God bless her.

01:58:24.055 --> 01:58:25.847
Ella is peace.
