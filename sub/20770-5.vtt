WEBVTT

02:00.621 --> 02:03.541
We just drove by.
His car's still there.

02:03.666 --> 02:05.835
<i>What the hell, Gene?</i>

02:05.960 --> 02:07.753
<i>Is he still inside?</i>

02:07.878 --> 02:09.755
Can't tell, but the lights
are on in there.

02:09.880 --> 02:10.798
Fuck, Gene!

02:10.923 --> 02:12.716
This job was supposed
to be done yesterday.

02:12.842 --> 02:14.176
Are you trying
to get me killed?

02:14.301 --> 02:15.719
What do you want us to do?

02:15.845 --> 02:17.012
We're all over it.

02:17.138 --> 02:18.347
Fuck!

02:22.810 --> 02:24.728
She's a worrier.

02:24.854 --> 02:25.938
Yeah.

03:33.923 --> 03:36.091
Cause of death...

03:36.217 --> 03:38.260
Took me a while, but I think

03:38.385 --> 03:40.346
someone cut this man's head off.

03:42.932 --> 03:45.184
Here's the headline.

03:45.309 --> 03:47.895
Actually, I just gave you
the headline.

03:50.231 --> 03:53.651
Yeah, I'm still doing stand-up
on the weekends.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.946
This man hadn't eaten for days,

03:57.071 --> 03:58.155
at least not any food,

03:58.280 --> 04:01.700
but I found this in his stomach.

04:07.122 --> 04:10.751
Maybe it's just me,
but I'd start with the wife.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.133
It's inscribed.

04:18.259 --> 04:22.054
Yes, it says...

04:22.179 --> 04:24.640
"To Dougie,

04:24.765 --> 04:29.228
with love, Janey-E."

04:56.755 --> 05:00.384
And now food is coming.

06:36.438 --> 06:39.066
You're still with me.

06:39.191 --> 06:40.651
That's good.

06:56.125 --> 06:58.669
Could you send in Steven,
please?

07:06.176 --> 07:07.428
Sir, you wanted to see me?

07:07.553 --> 07:09.221
Yes, I wanted to see you.
Sit down.

07:11.682 --> 07:13.725
Okay.

07:13.851 --> 07:15.102
Great.

07:15.227 --> 07:18.439
Yeah, well, not great.

07:19.815 --> 07:21.775
You think you're
some sort of hotshot?

07:21.900 --> 07:22.985
Excuse me?

07:23.110 --> 07:24.570
This résumé is
one of the worst written

07:24.695 --> 07:26.071
I've ever seen,

07:26.196 --> 07:27.948
and you didn't even
fill out this form properly.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.700
Not even close.
It's incomplete.

07:29.825 --> 07:31.160
It's worse than sloppy.

07:31.285 --> 07:32.870
I wanted to see you
to tell you

07:32.995 --> 07:36.123
that if you ever want
to find work anyplace,

07:36.248 --> 07:37.583
then you better
get your act together,

07:37.708 --> 07:40.169
do things properly,
and start showing some respect

07:40.294 --> 07:42.129
for a possible
future employer,

07:42.254 --> 07:45.174
because based on this shit,
you'd never get hired here,

07:45.299 --> 07:49.428
and I would never recommend you
for any work, anyplace.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.432
Now, you can get up
and get your ass out of here.

08:05.068 --> 08:06.904
What an asshole.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.286
That's rough.

08:15.746 --> 08:17.664
Yeah.

08:17.789 --> 08:20.417
When do you get
those tests back?

08:20.542 --> 08:21.752
<i>Sheriff Truman?</i>

08:21.877 --> 08:23.754
<i>Your wife is here.</i>

08:23.879 --> 08:26.465
<i>She went to your office,
and you weren't there.</i>

08:26.590 --> 08:28.258
<i>I could have told her that.</i>

08:28.383 --> 08:29.468
Hold on a minute.

08:29.593 --> 08:30.677
<i>She is now walking</i>

08:30.802 --> 08:33.347
<i>to Deputy Chief Hawk's office,</i>

08:33.472 --> 08:35.015
<i>where you are.</i>

08:35.140 --> 08:37.100
Thank you, Lucy.

08:37.226 --> 08:39.811
Doris is coming.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.897
You hang tough, Harry.

08:43.649 --> 08:46.527
Okay. I'll check in
with you tomorrow.

08:52.491 --> 08:54.910
Why aren't you in your office?

08:55.035 --> 08:56.411
Because I'm here.

08:56.537 --> 08:57.913
You making fun of me?

08:58.038 --> 08:59.289
What is it, Doris?

08:59.414 --> 09:01.500
Dwight's got diarrhea.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.544
The twins are coming
this weekend.

09:03.669 --> 09:05.921
He got in
the upper cupboard again.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.550
And I am not going another day
with a leaking pipe.

09:09.675 --> 09:11.260
It soaked the pantry floor,

09:11.385 --> 09:15.514
and we're gonna get
that black mold, Frank!

09:19.726 --> 09:21.562
Did you call them?

09:21.687 --> 09:22.771
Yes.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.231
They're very busy.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.316
They know all about
the leaking pipe

09:26.441 --> 09:29.236
and promise to have it fixed
by tomorrow night.

09:30.696 --> 09:34.157
So I have to go a full day
with a leaking pipe?

09:34.283 --> 09:36.076
Do you realize
what this is gonna cause?

09:36.201 --> 09:37.869
You have a bucket under it?

09:37.995 --> 09:38.829
Yes!

09:38.954 --> 09:40.080
But it filled up,

09:40.205 --> 09:42.332
and it slopped
all over the floor.

09:42.457 --> 09:46.461
I can't keep my eye on a bucket
all day, Frank.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.130
Can you get a bigger bucket?

09:48.255 --> 09:53.176
Oh. Oh, so I can spend money
on a bucket

09:53.302 --> 09:55.762
that we'll probably
never use again,

09:55.887 --> 09:57.598
but I can't spend money

09:57.723 --> 10:00.809
on that new rug
that I really like.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.561
Is that it?

10:02.686 --> 10:05.731
That is not fair, Frank.

10:05.856 --> 10:07.399
And what about Dad's car?

10:07.524 --> 10:09.359
I'm not gonna have him killed

10:09.484 --> 10:12.362
in that damn death-trap car.

10:12.487 --> 10:13.739
I told you this.

10:13.864 --> 10:15.449
Sammy looked at it,

10:15.574 --> 10:17.868
and it's fine.

10:17.993 --> 10:19.286
When?

10:21.288 --> 10:23.624
About two hours ago.

10:23.749 --> 10:26.001
Well, I wish
you would've called me.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.629
I've been just waiting
at the house

10:28.754 --> 10:31.381
in case Dad needed
a ride somewhere.

10:37.346 --> 10:40.098
You're impossible!

10:50.275 --> 10:52.152
Go get in the car, Sonny Jim.

11:04.206 --> 11:06.833
Okay, I hid the money.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.168
I counted it‒

11:08.293 --> 11:12.381
$425,000.

11:16.927 --> 11:19.346
Don't worry.
It's in our secret place.

11:19.471 --> 11:22.891
Now, when you get to work,
call them and set up a time

11:23.016 --> 11:25.477
and pay them
their 50 grand, okay?

11:27.396 --> 11:29.940
Then we'll be free and clear.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.496
Okay, Dougie, you're acting
weird as shit.

11:44.621 --> 11:47.666
Just don't forget
to call them, okay?

11:47.791 --> 11:50.627
And no more drinking
and gambling.

11:50.752 --> 11:53.255
Now get going.
You'll be late for work.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.715
Work.

11:57.843 --> 11:59.886
Damn. Your car.

12:00.011 --> 12:02.556
Okay, get in.
I'll drive you.

12:03.432 --> 12:05.225
Where is your car, anyway?

12:11.314 --> 12:12.441
In the car!

14:16.398 --> 14:18.358
Get out of the car, Dougie.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.614
I think you're having
one of your episodes.

14:24.739 --> 14:25.907
Now listen to me.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.701
You need to pull yourself together

14:27.826 --> 14:29.077
and get to work.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.538
Get out of this car now.

14:36.126 --> 14:39.754
Get out of this car
and go to work.

14:39.880 --> 14:43.758
Dougie, get to work.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.679
Dougie!

14:53.977 --> 14:55.270
Honestly.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.404
Off in dreamland again,
huh, Dougie?

16:27.529 --> 16:28.613
Get the lead out, pal.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.824
Staff meeting starts
in three minutes.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.601
- Mary.
- Mm-hmm.

16:58.727 --> 16:59.811
Seven up.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.023
All right.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.994
Coffee.

17:16.119 --> 17:18.830
Sorry, Dougie.
I didn't get one for you.

17:18.955 --> 17:20.415
I didn't even know
if you'd be here today.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.792
- Coffee.
- All right.

17:22.917 --> 17:24.002
You can have Frank's.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.253
He never drinks his, anyway,

17:25.378 --> 17:27.047
and I got an extra green tea.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.049
Maybe he'll like that, huh?

17:37.182 --> 17:40.852
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

17:40.977 --> 17:43.438
Mmm, mmm.

17:44.856 --> 17:46.274
Damn good joe, huh, Dougie?

17:46.399 --> 17:50.070
- Ah, damn good joe.
- Yeah, yeah.

17:50.195 --> 17:53.239
Mmm, mmm.

17:53.364 --> 17:54.449
It's pretty damn good.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.875
Hey, thanks for coming in.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.252
I hope everything's okay.

18:06.377 --> 18:07.879
Yeah, no problem.

18:08.004 --> 18:09.631
Coffee?

18:09.756 --> 18:11.716
Oh! Oh, great.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.136
You all right?

18:17.180 --> 18:18.681
I don't know him.

18:21.184 --> 18:23.144
Dougie...

18:23.269 --> 18:24.813
come on, pal.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.189
Come along.

18:49.671 --> 18:51.297
Hey!

18:51.422 --> 18:53.216
Look who's back
from Bendersville.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.719
With a new haircut.

18:58.054 --> 18:59.514
I covered for your ass, pal.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.683
You owe me big-time for that.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.729
What'd you do?
Huh?

19:06.855 --> 19:08.815
Did you go drinking
in a steam bath?

19:13.653 --> 19:15.780
Hmm. Okay.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.745
Yeah. Good morning.

19:27.250 --> 19:28.626
Did you get my note?

19:28.751 --> 19:31.462
No, I didn't get your note.

19:31.588 --> 19:34.424
I sent you one.

19:34.549 --> 19:36.968
Tell it to your wife, Darren.

19:57.405 --> 19:59.199
Hey, Phil.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.787
I gave Dougie your coffee.
I'm sorry.

20:04.913 --> 20:05.788
He really wanted it.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.877
Do you want
this green tea latte?

20:11.002 --> 20:12.086
No.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.546
I wa‒I want that.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.094
Sorry. Uh...

20:20.220 --> 20:21.137
Sorry.

20:21.262 --> 20:22.513
Okay.

20:24.057 --> 20:25.683
I'll try it.

21:01.344 --> 21:03.680
All right, let's get started.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.351
Sit down, Dougie.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.607
Cut the shit, Dougie.

21:16.609 --> 21:17.986
Hey, come here.
Come here.

21:18.111 --> 21:19.362
Hey, Dougie.

21:19.487 --> 21:21.781
Right here. Come on.

21:35.878 --> 21:38.840
Tony, lead us off.

21:38.965 --> 21:42.093
Okay, I've got, uh,
16 new claims this week,

21:42.218 --> 21:43.428
and two claims from last week

21:43.553 --> 21:45.513
have been processed
and approved,

21:45.638 --> 21:46.764
so we have to pay out.

21:46.889 --> 21:48.057
Which ones are those?

21:48.182 --> 21:49.851
The Beakers, who had
the broken water main,

21:49.976 --> 21:50.893
and Littlefield.

21:51.019 --> 21:54.272
Forensics
made Littlefield for arson.

21:54.397 --> 21:56.065
There‒there's no arson,
Bushnell.

21:56.190 --> 21:59.319
Um, the inspectors cleared it.
It checks out.

21:59.444 --> 22:00.778
It's legit.

22:00.903 --> 22:03.406
We have to honor the claim.

22:08.369 --> 22:09.871
He's lying.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.299
What'd you say?

22:27.680 --> 22:28.723
What did you say?

22:31.642 --> 22:33.686
Are you calling me a liar, Dougie?

22:37.106 --> 22:39.734
Hey, where the hell do you
get off calling me a liar?

22:39.859 --> 22:41.861
What do you mean
by that, Dougie?

22:45.448 --> 22:48.951
I want you in my office
as soon as we're finished here.

22:52.413 --> 22:54.916
So, like I was saying,

22:55.041 --> 22:57.377
Littlefield's legit.

22:58.711 --> 22:59.879
May I continue?

23:02.173 --> 23:04.258
Is that okay with you, Dougie?

23:04.384 --> 23:05.843
My friend?

23:16.813 --> 23:18.689
Close the door behind you...

23:22.276 --> 23:24.028
...on your way out.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.621
Dougie, where do you
get the stones

23:33.746 --> 23:36.082
to call my best agent a liar?

23:36.874 --> 23:38.751
Agent.

23:38.876 --> 23:41.921
He closes more cases in a week
than you do in a month.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.342
Agent.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.305
This is serious, Dougie.
This is no game.

23:52.223 --> 23:53.808
- Game.
- Uh-huh.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.769
Okay, Dougie,
we'll play a game.

23:56.894 --> 23:58.354
It's a homework game,

23:58.479 --> 24:00.481
since you missed
the last two days of school,

24:00.606 --> 24:02.316
smart guy.

24:02.442 --> 24:04.694
I want you to take
these case files

24:04.819 --> 24:06.404
home with you tonight.

24:07.947 --> 24:12.034
I need a full assessment
on each case.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.120
And what you come back
with tomorrow

24:14.245 --> 24:17.790
will have a whole hell of a lot to do
with your future at this company.

24:20.084 --> 24:21.627
Case files.

24:36.726 --> 24:38.811
Is the men's room locked?

24:38.936 --> 24:40.480
Come on, I'll sneak you
in the ladies'.

24:40.605 --> 24:41.939
Come on.

24:54.035 --> 24:58.206
You know, I was thinking...

24:58.331 --> 25:01.876
maybe I'll let you
kiss me now, handsome.

25:03.961 --> 25:06.047
Okay, go ahead.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.757
I'll keep watch.

25:36.911 --> 25:38.162
Yes?

25:42.416 --> 25:43.709
I'll tell him now.

25:44.794 --> 25:46.587
They're on their way up.

26:03.980 --> 26:07.441
Thirty jackpots in a row.

26:07.567 --> 26:10.027
We haven't paid out that many
in a year.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.072
Turn him around.

26:29.213 --> 26:32.091
How much did that man there
on the television win?

26:32.216 --> 26:34.135
$425,000.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.720
Hmm.

26:39.348 --> 26:42.268
Four hundred twenty f‒

26:42.393 --> 26:44.770
And you're trying to tell us
that you weren't in on this?

26:44.895 --> 26:46.856
How much did
that man win, again?

26:46.981 --> 26:47.982
$425,000.

27:03.998 --> 27:06.584
You're fucking fired.

27:06.709 --> 27:08.127
Get him out of here.

27:30.691 --> 27:32.818
Leave town.

27:35.488 --> 27:37.698
Don't ever come back.

27:46.082 --> 27:48.334
You.

27:48.459 --> 27:50.252
You got his job.

27:56.133 --> 27:58.302
You let us know

27:58.427 --> 28:02.306
if this man <i>ever</i>
comes in here again.

28:03.974 --> 28:06.727
Mm.

29:36.525 --> 29:39.028
Fuck off, kid!
Get the fuck out of here!

29:56.003 --> 29:57.129
Fuck!

31:11.036 --> 31:12.621
All done, Jade.

31:12.746 --> 31:16.458
Hey, you got a john
in the state of Washington?

31:16.584 --> 31:18.377
What?

31:18.502 --> 31:20.004
Found this hotel key
in your car.

31:24.049 --> 31:25.801
Oh, Dougie.

31:30.347 --> 31:31.348
Give me a second, Chris.

32:08.385 --> 32:10.846
Toad, bread's here.

32:14.975 --> 32:16.310
Hey.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.520
Hey, Toad.

32:18.646 --> 32:19.897
Hiya, Becky.

32:20.022 --> 32:22.024
- Thank you.
- Thank you, dear.

32:24.902 --> 32:26.111
Hi.

32:26.236 --> 32:27.363
What's up?

32:27.488 --> 32:28.989
I can't stand this.

32:29.114 --> 32:31.075
I need some more money.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.576
I'm sorry.

32:36.789 --> 32:39.041
He's looking for work.

32:39.166 --> 32:41.168
That's a lot.

32:45.047 --> 32:46.799
He will find a job.

33:10.781 --> 33:13.158
- Honey, I can give you this.
- Okay.

33:13.283 --> 33:15.995
- But this is all I got.
- Thanks. I love you.

33:17.246 --> 33:19.081
I love you too, Becky.

33:45.024 --> 33:46.400
Shelly, this is the third time

33:46.525 --> 33:48.652
she's asked you for money
in two weeks.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.362
I know.

33:52.906 --> 33:54.700
If you don't help her now,

33:54.825 --> 33:57.828
it's gonna get a lot harder
to help her later.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.291
We both know that tune,
don't we?

34:09.965 --> 34:11.675
How much money did we get?

34:15.345 --> 34:17.473
- Aw.
- $72.

34:23.270 --> 34:25.731
Hey, cheer up.
I'm good for it.

34:25.856 --> 34:27.399
I'll pay her back.

34:39.995 --> 34:41.455
They're watching us.

34:44.374 --> 34:45.292
I'm gonna roll.

35:17.116 --> 35:19.284
Kiss me.

35:46.311 --> 35:48.772
And now I'm gonna take my girl
out to dinner.

35:50.065 --> 35:51.900
Hey, I saved some for you.

35:52.025 --> 35:53.360
Want a taste?

35:55.445 --> 35:57.739
Did you take
all of that today?

35:57.865 --> 35:59.283
Yeah.

36:01.493 --> 36:04.705
Why?

36:04.830 --> 36:07.207
Why wouldn't I?

36:07.332 --> 36:09.459
For my interviews.
You know how nervous I get.

36:09.585 --> 36:10.502
Come on.

36:10.627 --> 36:13.881
Besides, I got some
great fucking feedback today.

36:27.728 --> 36:30.397
I'll tell you
all about it at dinner.

36:30.522 --> 36:33.692
And in between,
I'll tell you...

36:33.817 --> 36:35.652
how much I love you,

36:35.777 --> 36:37.654
and I'll tell you
how beautiful you are,

36:37.779 --> 36:39.072
and I'll tell you

36:39.198 --> 36:42.826
how sexy you are,

36:42.951 --> 36:45.162
and those tits,
how majestic they are,

36:45.287 --> 36:47.623
and that ass‒
give me a break,

36:47.748 --> 36:49.875
and I'll get you some bread.

36:50.000 --> 36:50.959
Why?

36:51.084 --> 36:53.128
Because I heard you've been
kneading it all day.

36:58.759 --> 37:02.429
<i>♪ I love how you love me ♪</i>

37:08.143 --> 37:12.022

37:15.108 --> 37:18.320

- Come on.
- Come on, Dougie, move!

38:27.431 --> 38:28.765
- We have arrived.
- Hello?

38:28.890 --> 38:30.309
- Come on!
- Dougie, come on.

38:30.434 --> 38:32.311
- Jeez!
- Get out of the way.

40:26.967 --> 40:29.511
Hawk?

40:29.636 --> 40:31.847
Have you found any Indians?

40:33.807 --> 40:34.724
Anywhere?

40:34.850 --> 40:37.894
I-I haven't found any Indians.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.898
No, Andy.

40:59.249 --> 41:01.835
It's seven o'clock.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.962
Do you know
where your freedom is?

41:13.638 --> 41:15.390
Coming to you live

41:15.515 --> 41:17.893
and electrified
from studio A,

41:18.018 --> 41:21.021
high atop the escarpments
of White Tail Peak,

41:21.146 --> 41:22.772
the roof‒
ruff, ruff‒

41:22.898 --> 41:25.358
of the American Hindu Kush,

41:25.484 --> 41:27.068
this is Dr. Amp

41:27.194 --> 41:29.279
doing the vamp
for liberty,

41:29.404 --> 41:32.115
climbing the ramp
to justice,

41:32.240 --> 41:35.035
and lighting the lamp
of freedom.

41:40.916 --> 41:43.001
So...

41:43.126 --> 41:45.629
what's on your mind tonight?

41:45.754 --> 41:48.256
I mean, you know I'm gonna
tell you what's on mine.

41:48.381 --> 41:50.842
We're sinking down deep
in the mud,

41:50.967 --> 41:53.136
and the fucks are at it again!

41:53.261 --> 41:57.057
The same vast global
corporate conspiracy.

41:57.182 --> 41:58.642
Different day.

41:58.767 --> 42:02.687
You can't see it
without a cosmic flashlight.

42:02.812 --> 42:04.189
Guess what.

42:07.359 --> 42:09.319
I've got one.

42:09.444 --> 42:11.404
Oh, yeah.

42:11.530 --> 42:13.823
And its beam, it penetrates

42:13.949 --> 42:16.284
the igneous rock of ignorance.

42:16.409 --> 42:18.161
It flips that rock over,

42:18.286 --> 42:20.956
and there they are, exposed,

42:21.081 --> 42:22.791
wriggling, squirming,

42:22.916 --> 42:25.752
crawling on their bellies
like foul maggots,

42:25.877 --> 42:29.339
frantically racing back
to the cover of darkness

42:29.464 --> 42:31.925
that they so crave.

42:32.050 --> 42:33.593
We're coming for you.

42:33.718 --> 42:36.179
<i>Yeah, we're coming for you.</i>

42:36.304 --> 42:39.224
<i>Let's just see
what they're cooking up today.</i>

42:39.349 --> 42:41.226
I know what
I'll be cooking up.

42:43.228 --> 42:44.729
<i>Know the ingredients.</i>

42:44.854 --> 42:46.523
Just read what's on the box.

42:46.648 --> 42:48.817
In fact,
read between the lines.

42:48.942 --> 42:51.528
What's lurking in that‒
that toaster waffle,

42:51.653 --> 42:53.280
those muffins...

42:53.405 --> 42:55.365
<i>that frozen children's treat?</i>

42:55.490 --> 42:56.783
<i>Poison!</i>

42:56.908 --> 42:58.410
<i>Deadly poisons.</i>

42:58.535 --> 43:00.036
That's what's there.

43:00.161 --> 43:02.080
And what's waiting for you?

43:02.205 --> 43:03.540
Cancer!

43:03.665 --> 43:04.624
Leukemia!

43:04.749 --> 43:06.710
<i>Autoimmune disorders!</i>

43:06.835 --> 43:08.295
Pulmonary embolism!

43:08.420 --> 43:09.379
Warts!

43:09.504 --> 43:11.464
Psoriasis, eczema!

43:11.590 --> 43:13.341
Cardiac arrest!

43:13.466 --> 43:16.720
Where are the cops
when we need them?

43:16.845 --> 43:18.305
Anorexia,

43:18.430 --> 43:20.473
body-image bullshit,

43:20.599 --> 43:23.768
microbial toxins,
bacterial toxins,

43:23.893 --> 43:25.520
environmental toxins!

43:25.645 --> 43:28.148
Our air, our water, our earth.

43:28.273 --> 43:29.691
The very soil itself!

43:29.816 --> 43:31.151
Our food!

43:31.276 --> 43:33.403
Our bodies poisoned!

43:33.528 --> 43:35.113
Poisoned!

43:41.536 --> 43:43.622
Ahh.

43:45.206 --> 43:47.083
That's...

43:47.208 --> 43:49.502
huckleberry extract

43:49.628 --> 43:50.879
in clean, boiled water

43:51.004 --> 43:53.673
from the pure, artesian springs

43:53.798 --> 43:55.425
of White Tail Peak.

43:55.550 --> 43:57.260
Yeah.

43:57.385 --> 44:00.180
<i>Fuck that acai berry shit
from the Amazon.</i>

44:02.891 --> 44:05.435
In the immortal words
of Pete Seeger,

44:05.560 --> 44:07.687
if I had a hammer...

44:07.812 --> 44:09.439
Guess what.

44:09.564 --> 44:11.066
I've got a hammer.

44:20.158 --> 44:22.160
You must see,

44:22.285 --> 44:25.705
hear, understand, and act.

44:25.830 --> 44:27.999
<i>Act now.</i>

44:31.211 --> 44:35.674
<i>Friends, we all live in the mud.</i>

44:35.799 --> 44:37.884
<i>In the shit!</i>

44:38.009 --> 44:41.680
Shovel your way
out of the shit.

44:55.944 --> 44:58.947
This is your shiny gold shovel.

44:59.072 --> 45:02.075
Two coats, guaranteed.

45:02.200 --> 45:05.078
Shovel your way out of the shit

45:05.203 --> 45:07.664
<i>and into the truth.</i>

45:07.789 --> 45:12.293
Dig yourself
out of the shit‒$29.99.

45:12.419 --> 45:13.503
That's right.

45:13.628 --> 45:17.549
Only $29.99 plus shipping.

45:17.674 --> 45:20.009
<i>Accept no substitute.</i>

45:20.135 --> 45:22.345
<i>Get yours now.</i>

45:31.479 --> 45:33.189
You can go in now.

45:39.028 --> 45:40.405
We got another database hit

45:40.530 --> 45:43.158
on prints
for Major Garland Briggs.

45:44.701 --> 45:47.328
Major Garland Briggs.

45:47.454 --> 45:49.372
All right.

45:49.497 --> 45:50.915
And how many is that?

45:51.040 --> 45:52.709
This would be the 16th time.

45:52.834 --> 45:56.713
Sixteen hits
in, what, 25 years?

45:58.006 --> 45:59.132
And where'd this one
come from?

45:59.257 --> 46:01.885
Police.
Buckhorn, South Dakota.

46:02.886 --> 46:04.554
Another wild-goose chase, I bet,

46:04.679 --> 46:06.598
but we got to check it out.

46:07.932 --> 46:09.476
You ever been
to South Dakota, Cindy?

46:11.227 --> 46:13.229
I hear it's lovely
this time of year.

46:13.354 --> 46:16.941
And remember,
if this is real‒

46:17.066 --> 46:18.318
but it won't be‒

46:18.443 --> 46:20.779
but if it's real,

46:20.904 --> 46:22.697
we have to alert the FBI.

46:26.451 --> 46:28.369
I'm booking the flight.

46:28.495 --> 46:29.579
First class, Cindy.

46:29.704 --> 46:32.248
Yeah, right.

48:12.098 --> 48:14.475
I have to ask you
to stop smoking.

48:19.022 --> 48:20.773
Put that cigarette out.

48:23.735 --> 48:24.903
Make me.

48:31.868 --> 48:33.578
I'll take care of this.

48:35.121 --> 48:37.415
Just make sure
he stops smoking in here.

48:37.540 --> 48:38.958
Okay?

48:43.421 --> 48:45.048
Give me a smoke.

48:54.349 --> 48:56.100
Keep the whole pack.

48:57.602 --> 48:58.853
Thanks, buddy.

49:39.477 --> 49:41.312
Hey, can I have a light?

49:45.608 --> 49:47.276
Come here.

49:57.495 --> 49:59.288
Sit down.

50:08.131 --> 50:10.299
- Hey.
- Hey what?

50:11.968 --> 50:13.720
What's your name?

50:13.845 --> 50:16.848
- Charlotte.
- Yeah?

50:16.973 --> 50:18.891
You want to fuck me,
Charlotte?

50:20.893 --> 50:22.020
You want to fuck?

50:22.145 --> 50:23.229
No. No, stop it.

50:23.354 --> 50:24.897
Hey, leave her alone.

50:28.735 --> 50:30.737
Little fucking
smoking babies.

50:33.197 --> 50:34.699
Makes me laugh.

50:37.326 --> 50:40.121
I'm gonna laugh
when I fuck you, bitch!

52:45.705 --> 52:47.123
One phone call.

52:51.294 --> 52:53.171
Thank you, Warden Murphy.

53:27.163 --> 53:28.748
Are we recording?

53:28.873 --> 53:30.374
Recording everything.

53:33.419 --> 53:35.546
<i>Now that everyone's here,</i>

53:35.671 --> 53:37.715
<i>I will make my phone call.</i>

53:40.927 --> 53:44.388
<i>Now, who should I call?</i>

53:46.724 --> 53:49.435
<i>Should I call Mr. Strawberry?</i>

53:53.564 --> 53:55.274
What the hell?

53:55.399 --> 53:59.654
<i>No, I don't think
I'll call Mr. Strawberry.</i>

53:59.779 --> 54:02.615
<i>I don't think
he's taking calls.</i>

54:05.034 --> 54:06.077
<i>I know.</i>

54:08.162 --> 54:10.581
<i>I know who to call.</i>

54:33.271 --> 54:34.313
What the hell?

54:34.438 --> 54:37.817
How is he doing this?
How is he doing this?

54:37.942 --> 54:40.820
Did he make a call?
What number did he dial?
