<i>Previously on</i> Jonas LA...

00:01.875 --> 00:03.875
Mantra wants to meet with me
for our next album.

00:03.959 --> 00:06.834
I'm not interested in working
with your brothers, just you.

00:06.917 --> 00:10.458
I just read something online.
Jonas is breaking up.

00:10.542 --> 00:13.709
-You must be the famous Movie Brat.
-And you are single.

00:13.792 --> 00:15.500
Whoa. Boyfriend?

00:15.583 --> 00:17.000
She needs to know all of your flaws.

00:17.083 --> 00:19.500
You're afraid of commitment.
You can't make a decision

00:19.583 --> 00:22.709
or express your feelings.
And to top it all off, you have an ego.

00:22.792 --> 00:25.500
Your honesty has made me
feel closer to you.

00:25.583 --> 00:27.083
None of those flaws
you made up are working.

00:27.166 --> 00:28.834
Joe, I didn't make those up.

00:38.458 --> 00:41.250
-What do you think, Kev? A table for two?
-And one.

00:41.333 --> 00:44.208
Guy, I don't know why Mantra
started the rumor about me going solo,

00:44.291 --> 00:46.208
but it's not true
and no one's gonna believe it.

00:47.959 --> 00:50.250
Jonas? Together?

00:50.333 --> 00:52.291
Are you guys here
to beg Nick to come back

00:52.375 --> 00:55.000
or is this the breakup conversation?

00:55.083 --> 00:57.792
Look, I know it's probably
none of my business,

00:57.875 --> 01:00.458
but, Nick, I support you.

01:00.542 --> 01:03.583
No, I don't. I don't.
I love you guys together.

01:03.667 --> 01:06.417
I am freaking out.
OK.

01:07.834 --> 01:10.458
OK, right this way, please.

01:11.333 --> 01:13.709
-Wow.
-She seems nice.

01:15.625 --> 01:17.750
Guys, I seriously think
we need to put a statement up

01:17.834 --> 01:19.625
on our website
saying we're not breaking up.

01:19.709 --> 01:22.333
OK, Macy says that if we responded
to every crazy rumor,

01:22.417 --> 01:25.375
all we'd be doing is
responding to crazy rumors.

01:25.458 --> 01:27.125
Like Kevin being an alien baby.

01:27.208 --> 01:29.250
-I don't remember that one.
-It's my own theory.

01:29.333 --> 01:32.375
OK, so we agree we're just gonna
let the rumor go away on its own.

01:32.458 --> 01:33.542
[footsteps approaching]

01:33.625 --> 01:34.709
Oh, come on, man.

01:34.792 --> 01:37.291
Sorry, but we're just trying
to have breakfast, please.

01:37.542 --> 01:40.834
-Hello, Kevin.
-I know that voice.

01:41.750 --> 01:43.083
David Henrie.

01:43.750 --> 01:45.333
To what do I owe this displeasure?

01:45.417 --> 01:50.667
I challenge you... to a challenge...
on the beach... for my new reality show.

01:51.041 --> 01:54.834
It's called <i>David Henrie's</i>
<i>Celebrity Beach Challenge.</i>

01:54.917 --> 01:56.625
Come up with the name yourself?

01:56.709 --> 02:00.917
I did, actually,
with a roomful of writers who I hired.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.875
So, do you accept the... the challenge?

02:04.959 --> 02:07.125
Bring it on, Henrie.
There better be sunscreen.

02:07.208 --> 02:08.875
Oh, there will be.
And snacks.

02:08.959 --> 02:10.875
-The fruit better be fresh.
-Or what?

02:10.959 --> 02:14.250
-I won't eat it.
-Fine. More for me.

02:14.333 --> 02:16.083
Come on, guys, let's go.

02:17.542 --> 02:20.041
Wow, you guys really
go at it over nothing.

02:20.125 --> 02:22.208
That David Henrie
just gets under my skin.

02:22.291 --> 02:24.208
Whatever happened
between you guys anyway?

02:24.291 --> 02:26.083
-Can't get into it.
-That bad, huh?

02:26.166 --> 02:27.917
No, I just don't remember what it was.

02:29.125 --> 02:30.375
Hmm.

Kevin, David Henrie's trash-talking you
all over the internet.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.500
-The whole internet?
-A lot of it.

03:30.583 --> 03:33.041
He says that when he challenged you,
and I quote,

03:33.125 --> 03:35.041
you "Shivered like a wet dog."

03:36.500 --> 03:38.542
David Henrie is going down.

03:39.375 --> 03:41.250
Oh, no.
The feud again?

03:41.333 --> 03:43.959
-What was that even about?
-No one knows.

03:44.041 --> 03:46.417
-Good morning, Joe.
-Hey.

03:47.625 --> 03:51.917
Wow, I get a whole syllable today?
Must be my birthday.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.166
It's not your birthday.
I know when your birthday is.

03:54.250 --> 03:55.917
I was kidding.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.917
Oh, well, maybe you can put
"forgets birthdays" on your list, too.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.375
[sighs] Dude, will you just
let it go already, please?

04:02.458 --> 04:04.000
Maybe I should go.

04:05.667 --> 04:07.834
You know what?
I'm over it.

04:08.417 --> 04:11.458
-Wow, we really need to--
-Do something.

04:11.542 --> 04:13.750
-Yeah.
-OK.

04:18.625 --> 04:19.917
Hey, Joe...

04:21.250 --> 04:22.291
Are you OK?

04:22.375 --> 04:23.667
I'm just tired of the drama.

04:23.750 --> 04:25.000
I thought I liked him again,

04:25.083 --> 04:27.291
but after the way he's been acting,
I'm over it.

04:27.375 --> 04:28.709
Why would I want to be with somebody

04:28.792 --> 04:30.208
if all they do is point out
what's wrong with me?

04:30.291 --> 04:31.959
I was trying to help him.

04:32.041 --> 04:34.000
He can't name a single one
of his own flaws.

04:34.083 --> 04:37.000
She had a list:
I'm afraid of commitment,

04:37.083 --> 04:39.291
I'm oblivious, I have a huge ego,

04:39.375 --> 04:41.625
and apparently I don't know
how to express my feelings.

04:41.709 --> 04:43.625
I didn't mean to hurt his feelings.

04:43.709 --> 04:45.750
I don't know,
maybe this whole being-friends thing

04:45.834 --> 04:47.000
just wasn't meant to be.

04:47.083 --> 04:48.917
I don't even think
I can be friends with her anymore.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.750
-It's too painful.
-I'm just gonna stay out of her way...

04:51.834 --> 04:53.792
-Be polite...
-And try to get through...

04:53.875 --> 04:55.125
The rest of the summer.

04:56.250 --> 04:58.000
The rest of the summer.

04:58.959 --> 05:00.500
-This is bad.
-I know.

05:00.583 --> 05:02.125
-We need to--
-Meddle?

05:02.208 --> 05:04.083
I was gonna say, "Stay out of it,"

05:04.166 --> 05:06.250
-but let's try it your way.
-OK.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.250
Welcome to <i>David Henrie's</i>
<i>Celebrity Beach Challenge.</i>

05:14.333 --> 05:20.208
I'm David Henrie.
And this is my challenge.

05:21.375 --> 05:24.000
I should take this time
to introduce my challenger,

05:24.083 --> 05:30.083
and I use that word hilariously,
'cause it's Kevin from Jonas.

05:30.291 --> 05:33.458
Hey, everybody. I'm so happy to be here
to beat David Henrie at his own challenge.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.166
Yeah, right.
What planet are you from, bud?

05:35.250 --> 05:36.959
Why?
What did you hear?

05:37.709 --> 05:40.667
[clears throat]
Here's how it all works:

05:40.750 --> 05:44.041
There's there rounds.
Round one is worth five points.

05:44.125 --> 05:46.208
Round two is worth 50 points.

05:46.291 --> 05:49.458
And round three... 1,000 points.

05:49.542 --> 05:51.375
Of course.
Simple David Henrie logic.

05:51.458 --> 05:53.500
Why don't we just do round three?

05:53.583 --> 05:56.583
Why don't we just do round three?
'Cause I don't want to.

05:56.667 --> 05:58.875
[clears throat]
Our first challenge:

05:58.959 --> 06:03.542
it's called
"The Celebrity Joust... Challenge."

06:03.625 --> 06:05.333
Is that gonna happen
every time you say "challenge"?

06:05.417 --> 06:07.417
It might happen.
Got a prob?

06:07.500 --> 06:08.417
Challenge.

06:08.959 --> 06:11.083
Challenge.
Challenge.

06:11.834 --> 06:13.000
Challenge.

06:13.083 --> 06:14.333
Let me guess... challenge.

06:14.792 --> 06:15.792
Challenge.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.250
OK, that's it.

06:17.333 --> 06:18.583
Challenge.

06:23.166 --> 06:25.834
Here's how it works: the two of us
are gonna go to town on each other

06:25.917 --> 06:28.583
using our celebrity-safe jousting sticks.

06:28.667 --> 06:31.583
But not to the head or face,
that's a given.

06:31.667 --> 06:34.333
The first person to fall off
loses the round.

06:36.625 --> 06:38.375
[blows whistle]

06:38.458 --> 06:41.083
You don't want none of this mess.
But I can guarantee you something,

06:41.166 --> 06:43.083
you're gonna be a mess
when this is all over with.

06:43.166 --> 06:44.875
Get ready, 'cause it's gonna
come out of nowhere.

06:44.959 --> 06:46.208
[yells]

06:46.291 --> 06:47.625
[blows whistle]

06:49.000 --> 06:50.458
Yeah, big deal, five points.

06:50.542 --> 06:52.417
Whoopdie-doo.
Bring on round two!

06:54.125 --> 06:56.750
[Nick] This is just what you need,
a few hours out on the open seas

06:56.834 --> 06:58.500
-to clear your head.
-I think you're right, man.

06:58.583 --> 07:01.000
Just a little bro time,
get away from all the craziness.

07:01.083 --> 07:04.709
-[both laughing]
-Oh. Look who's here.

07:05.834 --> 07:08.542
Can you believe this?

07:08.625 --> 07:11.458
Talk about a small world.
Huh.

07:12.041 --> 07:13.333
You stink.

07:13.417 --> 07:14.417
[sighs]

07:15.000 --> 07:16.417
Never pegged you as a meddler, Nick.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.667
You've never used the words
"pegged" or "meddler" before.

07:18.750 --> 07:20.125
See what she brings out in me?

07:21.709 --> 07:24.125
So... all aboard?

07:26.375 --> 07:29.208
-I'm out of here.
-Later, dude.

07:29.291 --> 07:30.500
Stella...

07:33.166 --> 07:35.875
-Joe, slow down.
-No.

07:35.959 --> 07:37.333
Well, you're running out of dock.

07:37.417 --> 07:40.709
Well, I would have gone the other way,
but the dock was taken.

07:40.792 --> 07:44.125
-That was a dirty trick, Mace.
-I'm sorry, but we had to do something.

07:44.208 --> 07:45.917
I mean, you guys don't even
want to be friends anymore.

07:46.542 --> 07:49.417
-Why even bother?
-Because Stella still likes you.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.500
She told me even after everything
that you guys have been through

07:52.583 --> 07:55.291
she still thinks that you
are the one for her.

07:55.959 --> 07:57.291
Well, what about all my flaws?

07:57.375 --> 07:59.500
I don't know.
Stop having them.

08:00.375 --> 08:01.417
[chuckles]

08:01.500 --> 08:05.208
-Stella, come on.
-I don't like being manipulated, Nick.

08:05.291 --> 08:07.250
I know it was wrong and I apologize,

08:07.333 --> 08:10.125
but we had to do something
to get you two together.

08:10.208 --> 08:12.125
Why? So Joe could just ignore me?

08:12.208 --> 08:14.500
Look, I know he's been acting
a bit weird lately,

08:14.583 --> 08:16.417
but you really hurt his feelings.

08:17.166 --> 08:20.083
Oh, I know, the whole list of flaws.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.166
-But he kind of asked for it.
-I'm not saying he didn't.

08:23.542 --> 08:26.375
-He just really took it to heart.
-Why?

08:26.458 --> 08:28.417
Because it came from you.

08:31.959 --> 08:33.625
-I'm a bad person.
-No, you're not.

08:33.709 --> 08:35.500
-I'm insensitive.
-You say what you mean.

08:35.583 --> 08:37.667
-I can be sarcastic.
-You have a great sense of humor.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.542
-I'm way too judgmental.
-Yeah.

08:40.625 --> 08:42.208
I can't fight you on that one.

08:42.291 --> 08:44.000
See?

08:44.083 --> 08:46.625
But so what, you know?
Nobody's perfect.

08:46.709 --> 08:49.208
Not you, not me, certainly not Joe.

08:50.417 --> 08:52.291
Can we talk about this on the boat?

08:54.250 --> 08:56.041
You're paying by the hour, aren't you?

08:56.125 --> 08:58.709
-Yes, I am.
-Got it.

I can't remember who beat you last time.
Oh, that's right, this guy... me.

09:12.458 --> 09:15.417
Oh, yeah, you did.
Five points, whoopdie-doo.

High five... not.

Did you get all that
or should I slow it down for you?

-I'm not scared.
-[laughs] Oh, you will be.

10:21.750 --> 10:22.834
I'm not falling for that one.

10:22.917 --> 10:24.959

-Hi, Emily.

10:31.333 --> 10:32.709
Oh.

10:33.291 --> 10:35.250
Yes! [laughs]

10:35.333 --> 10:38.166

-Hey.

10:45.667 --> 10:47.959
-Is Jonas really breaking up?
-No.

10:48.041 --> 10:51.208
-All right, see you.
-Bye.

10:52.291 --> 10:54.250

-It is beautiful out here.

13:10.834 --> 13:13.959
And I'm not afraid to say it
because I am expressing how I feel.

13:14.041 --> 13:17.792
And I totally support you in a completely
positive and non-judgmental way.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.792
Stella, you want to give me
a hand with lunch?

13:21.875 --> 13:25.000
Absolutely.
Does anybody need anything?

13:25.125 --> 13:28.333
Water sounds nice.
Or juice. Maybe milk.

13:28.667 --> 13:31.291
Actually, scratch that.
I'm committing to water.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.125
Water it is.

13:33.208 --> 13:35.000
Although, I wouldn't criticize you
if you changed your mind.

13:35.083 --> 13:38.417
Nope, water's the only drink for me.
I am committing to it.

13:38.500 --> 13:39.542
That's wonderful.

13:39.625 --> 13:42.041
[Macy] OK, let's go.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.208
-What's wrong with you?
-Nothing.

13:47.291 --> 13:49.792
Macy said to get rid of my flaws,
so I'm committing.

13:49.875 --> 13:52.375
-To water?
-It's always been there for me.

13:52.458 --> 13:54.834
That's weird.
And I know you really want juice.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.333
I do.
I really do.

13:59.458 --> 14:01.542
Stella, I love you.
You're my best friend.

14:01.625 --> 14:03.208
But why are you acting like such a freak?

14:03.291 --> 14:05.083
I don't want to hurt Joe anymore.

14:05.375 --> 14:08.875
I need to be supportive,
non-judgmental, no sarcasm, no digs,

14:08.959 --> 14:11.000
although I know he's already
changed his mind to juice.

14:14.125 --> 14:15.250
OK.

14:15.333 --> 14:17.166
-You got it?
-Yep.

14:17.875 --> 14:19.417
Lunch.

14:22.250 --> 14:25.417
Oops, I forgot your water.
Is juice OK?

14:25.500 --> 14:28.500
Juice is wonderful.
I am thankful for my juice.

14:28.834 --> 14:29.959
You guys...

14:32.125 --> 14:34.291
The boat's not moving.
Why is the boat not moving?

14:34.375 --> 14:36.291
The anchor dropped.

14:37.667 --> 14:39.083
[whirring]

14:39.166 --> 14:40.250
Well, pull it back up.

14:41.208 --> 14:42.750
It's stuck.

14:43.750 --> 14:47.417
So, let me get this straight;
we're never getting back to shore?

14:47.500 --> 14:49.542
Macy, it's gonna be all right.
We'll get the anchor up.

14:49.625 --> 14:51.333
Oh, really?
How do you know?

14:51.417 --> 14:53.125
Are you the anchor?
No, no, honey,

14:53.208 --> 14:55.500
-you're not the anchor.
-Honey, stay calm.

14:55.583 --> 14:58.792
You know, the last time someone
told me to stay calm, I was six.

14:59.291 --> 15:02.291
My mom took me to Happy Land,
and we were on a boat ride.

15:02.375 --> 15:05.083
[giggles] There were these little
robot puppets

15:05.166 --> 15:07.792
that kept on singing,
"It's a happy little land for you and me.

15:07.875 --> 15:10.250
-It's a happy little land for you and me."
-[Joe singing]

15:10.333 --> 15:12.291
And then the boat got stuck!

15:12.375 --> 15:15.208
And the song kept on
playing and playing.

15:15.291 --> 15:17.375
And the robot puppets
kept on singing and singing.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.208
-And there was this... What?
-Joe!

15:20.291 --> 15:22.208
Sorry, it's a catchy tune, OK?

15:22.583 --> 15:24.583
And sometimes I can just be oblivious.

15:24.667 --> 15:28.166
-Not anymore.
-No judgments.

15:28.291 --> 15:30.291
Will you guys just stop?!

15:30.333 --> 15:33.208
OK, we are stuck
in the middle of the ocean!

15:33.291 --> 15:36.250
Macy, the shore is right over there, OK?

15:36.333 --> 15:39.000
There's a manual crank below.
I'll get the anchor up.

15:39.125 --> 15:43.208
-Let's go.
-OK. So, what are we doing up here?

15:45.166 --> 15:47.291
-[seal barking]
-Is that a shark fin?

15:49.917 --> 15:52.291
-It's a seal.
-Aww.

15:54.709 --> 15:58.166
-Boy, can some people be weird on boats.
-No kidding.

15:58.250 --> 16:00.458
-I mean, it's just a boat, right?
-What was that?

16:00.542 --> 16:02.125
Promise you won't freak out?

16:02.500 --> 16:04.709
[sighs]
I promise.

16:04.959 --> 16:07.709
Remember that crank I was trying to find?

16:07.792 --> 16:08.875
Uh-huh.

16:09.542 --> 16:10.542
Yeah, I can't find it.

16:11.917 --> 16:13.125
We're doomed.

16:13.208 --> 16:14.875
We are...

16:14.959 --> 16:16.750
Are you ready for the final challenge?

16:16.834 --> 16:17.667
It's a little something I call

16:17.750 --> 16:19.625
"The <i>David Henrie's</i>
<i>Celebrity Beach Challenge--"</i>

16:19.709 --> 16:21.917
OK, I get it. Enough.
Let's just end this.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.500
All right, fine. I'm gonna give you
one chance to apologize

16:24.583 --> 16:26.667
and avoid any further public humiliation.

16:26.750 --> 16:29.750
Henrie, even if I knew what I did,
I still wouldn't apologize.

16:30.083 --> 16:31.834
Have it your way.

16:32.333 --> 16:35.417
Oh, would you like a...
would you like a melon wedge?

16:39.291 --> 16:42.375
You were supposed to
drop the tray... then.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.709
You're fired, Mom. Go.

16:47.542 --> 16:49.583
It's actually pretty peaceful out here.

16:49.792 --> 16:53.208
Yeah. What if we were
stuck out here forever?

16:54.000 --> 16:57.208
Or a storm came and blew us
to a tropical island?

16:57.291 --> 16:59.250
We'd have to learn how to survive.

16:59.667 --> 17:02.917
We could live off the land.
I could fish and build us a hut.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
I could make clothes out of palm leaves
and little accessories out of seashells.

17:07.083 --> 17:09.917
[laughs]
We could have a pet monkey.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.458
[both laughing]

17:11.542 --> 17:14.041
We could have whatever we wanted.

17:14.125 --> 17:16.875
I mean, it would be like starting over.

17:19.709 --> 17:23.500
Starting over,
I like the sound of that.

17:24.875 --> 17:26.166
You really want that monkey, don't you?

17:26.250 --> 17:28.250
[laughs]

17:29.750 --> 17:33.375
I think I'm gonna...
go check on that crank.

17:34.333 --> 17:36.959
Yeah.
Yeah, a good idea.

17:41.750 --> 17:42.792
-[panting]
-Guys.

17:43.417 --> 17:44.667
Doomed!

17:44.792 --> 17:46.125
-Whoa.
-Lost at sea!

17:46.667 --> 17:47.792
-We...
-What?

17:47.875 --> 17:49.208
She's gonna be fine.
Joe, what's up?

17:49.291 --> 17:51.000
I like Stella.

17:51.083 --> 17:52.834
I mean, I've always liked Stella,

17:52.917 --> 17:54.917
but now she's gonna let me
have a pet monkey.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.208
-He has ocean madness.
-No, he doesn't.

17:57.291 --> 17:59.750
-Joe, what are you trying to say?
-What I'm trying to say is...

17:59.834 --> 18:02.125
is that there's no one like Stella.

18:02.208 --> 18:05.709
She gets me.
She makes me laugh.

18:06.834 --> 18:08.667
And I want her to be my girlfriend.

18:08.750 --> 18:13.166
-Oh, so our plan worked.
-Wow, it did.

18:13.250 --> 18:16.041
And if we survive, we could totally
go on a double date. [chuckles]

18:17.208 --> 18:19.500
So, guys, what do I do?

18:19.625 --> 18:24.083
Joe, it's a gorgeous day,
you're on a boat on the ocean.

18:24.166 --> 18:26.000
-Forever.
-Not forever.

18:26.291 --> 18:29.792
Stella's waiting for you up there.
It's the perfect moment.

18:29.875 --> 18:33.458
-What if she turns me down?
-Joe, the summer is almost over.

18:33.542 --> 18:36.041
How many moments have you lost
because you were afraid to take a chance?

18:37.125 --> 18:38.333
-I don't know.
-A lot.

18:38.417 --> 18:39.667
Don't lose this one.

18:41.709 --> 18:43.792
It might be the best moment of your life.

18:43.875 --> 18:45.208
Right.

18:46.583 --> 18:47.959
Wow.

18:49.166 --> 18:50.291
So, I should probably just go--

18:50.375 --> 18:51.917
-Go.
-Call for help.

18:52.375 --> 18:54.125
Right, yep. That. Go.

18:54.208 --> 18:55.625
OK.

18:55.750 --> 18:57.208
[blows whistle]

18:57.291 --> 18:58.834
[both grunting]

19:00.709 --> 19:03.083
-I can't believe I used to like you.
-Yeah, I used to like you, too.

19:03.166 --> 19:05.500
We used to do all sorts of fun
celebrity things together.

19:05.583 --> 19:07.375
Yeah, what went wrong?

19:07.458 --> 19:09.667
Actually, you know what?
Seriously, what did I do?

19:09.750 --> 19:13.208
Fine. Does the name
Jenny Reese ring a bell?

19:13.291 --> 19:14.291
No.

19:14.417 --> 19:18.041
Here's a hint: Jenny Reese.

19:18.125 --> 19:21.166
Oh, you mean Jen?
Yeah, she was funny.

19:21.250 --> 19:23.750
She broke up with me
to go out with you.

19:23.834 --> 19:26.375
I never dated Jen.
She went out with Joe.

19:26.458 --> 19:30.959
Huh? Hmm.
How about that?

19:31.750 --> 19:32.709
Are you kidding?

19:32.792 --> 19:35.875
I'm sorry, all you guys
look alike to me and sound the same.

19:36.333 --> 19:40.208
We're battling over a frozen vat of goo
and you say "sorry"?

19:40.333 --> 19:43.500
I'll tell you what, we're even.
Happy?

19:44.959 --> 19:46.166
We drop it on three?

19:46.250 --> 19:48.417
Drop it on three. One...

19:48.500 --> 19:49.750
Two...

19:49.834 --> 19:51.583
[both]
Three.

19:52.417 --> 19:53.583
[exhales]

19:54.542 --> 19:55.625
So, we're cool?

19:55.709 --> 19:58.667
Yeah, man.
Hey, we're cool.

19:58.750 --> 19:59.750
Awesome.

20:01.333 --> 20:02.750
Whoa!

20:05.709 --> 20:07.000
[yells]

20:08.083 --> 20:09.333
Now we're cool.

20:11.417 --> 20:15.959
Joe from Jonas,
consider yourself challenged.

20:24.208 --> 20:26.834
-Stella.
-Hi.

20:26.917 --> 20:28.542
I need to ask you something.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.125
Yeah.
Is everything OK?

20:30.208 --> 20:34.166
Never better. Listen, I know
things have been rocky between us.

20:34.291 --> 20:37.583
-[boat approaches]
-[Aunt Lisa] Ahoy sailors!

20:40.041 --> 20:41.208
Aunt Lisa?

20:41.291 --> 20:42.709
What are you doing here?

20:42.792 --> 20:45.250
Well, I've been following you
the whole time.

20:45.333 --> 20:47.166
What kind of chaperone would I be
if I left my girls

20:47.250 --> 20:49.375
out on a boat with two rock stars, huh?

20:49.458 --> 20:51.375
Hold that thought, Aunt Lisa.

20:51.458 --> 20:52.625
-Stella.
-Yeah?

20:52.709 --> 20:55.125
[exclaims]
We're saved! Ha!

20:56.083 --> 20:57.583
[Nick]
It's a miracle.

20:57.667 --> 21:00.750
-Throw me a rope, girls.
-Get me off this boat.

21:01.834 --> 21:02.709
Sorry.

21:02.792 --> 21:05.125
Wait, everyone just hold up.
I'm not finished.

21:05.208 --> 21:06.709
-Stella.
-Yeah?

21:09.750 --> 21:11.166
The summer's almost over.

21:12.083 --> 21:14.792
And ever since we got to LA,
I've been wanting to ask you something.
