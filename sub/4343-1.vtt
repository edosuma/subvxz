WEBVTT

01:43.854 --> 01:46.857
On Sunday, August 13, 1961...

01:47.024 --> 01:49.610
the eyes of America
were on the nation's capital...

01:49.735 --> 01:53.322
where Roger Maris was hitting
home runs number 44 and 45...

01:53.405 --> 01:54.824
against the Senators.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.992
On that same day,
without any warning...

01:57.076 --> 01:59.328
the East German Communists
sealed off the border...

01:59.411 --> 02:02.206
between East and West Berlin.

02:02.248 --> 02:03.415
I only mention this...

02:03.499 --> 02:05.668
to show the kind of people
we're dealing with...

02:05.751 --> 02:07.920
Real shifty.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.506
Having been stationed in Berlin
and having dealt with them...

02:10.589 --> 02:12.091
I know what I'm talking about.

02:12.925 --> 02:14.760
Let's go back to last June.

02:14.844 --> 02:17.638
Considering the abnormal
situation of a divided city...

02:17.721 --> 02:20.057
life in Berlin
was more or less normal.

02:20.099 --> 02:22.351
Traffic flowed freely
through the Brandenburg Gate...

02:22.434 --> 02:23.686
and it wasn't really
too much trouble...

02:23.769 --> 02:25.437
to pass from one side
of the Iron Curtain...

02:25.479 --> 02:26.689
to the other.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.567
Some of the East German police
were rude and suspicious.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.944
Others were suspicious and rude.

02:32.027 --> 02:34.530
The eastern sector,
under Communist domination...

02:34.572 --> 02:36.073
was still in rubble...

02:36.115 --> 02:38.492
but the people went about
their daily business...

02:38.576 --> 02:39.743
parading.

03:32.171 --> 03:33.756
These constant provocations...

03:33.839 --> 03:36.091
failed to provoke
the West Berliners.

03:36.175 --> 03:37.760
They were too busy rebuilding.

03:38.928 --> 03:41.597
The western sector,
under Allied protection...

03:41.639 --> 03:43.557
was peaceful, prosperous...

03:43.599 --> 03:46.310
and enjoyed all the blessings
of democracy.

03:50.648 --> 03:51.982
Just by coincidence...

03:52.066 --> 03:54.276
this happens to be
the company I work for.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.920
Danke schön.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.137
Danke schön, Fritz.

04:29.645 --> 04:31.230
Danke schön.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.661
Danke schön already.

04:54.295 --> 04:55.754
Sitzen machen.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.099
Schlemmer!

05:11.228 --> 05:12.730
Good morning, Mr. MacNamara.

05:13.856 --> 05:15.441
Schlemmer, how many times
have I told you...

05:15.524 --> 05:16.900
I don't want those people
standing at attention...

05:16.984 --> 05:18.277
every time
I come into the office.

05:18.360 --> 05:21.530
I know.
I've given strict orders.

05:21.572 --> 05:23.741
Can't they get it through
their Prussian heads?

05:23.782 --> 05:25.075
They're living
in a democracy now.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.452
That is the trouble.

05:26.535 --> 05:27.995
In the old days,
if I ordered them to sit...

05:28.078 --> 05:29.121
they would sit.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.956
Now with a democracy,
they do what they want.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.249
What they want is to stand.

05:32.291 --> 05:33.917
Next, any word yet
from the mayor's office?

05:34.001 --> 05:35.169
Yes, sir. Negative.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.420
They absolutely
will not permit us...

05:36.462 --> 05:38.213
to install a Coke machine
in the Reichstag.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.090
Sometimes I wonder
who won the war.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.300
Next, did you pick up
those airline tickets...

05:41.383 --> 05:42.384
for my wife and children?

05:42.426 --> 05:43.969
Yes, sir. Positive.

05:44.053 --> 05:45.637
Three seats on a 6:00 plane
to Venice.

05:45.721 --> 05:46.722
They change in Frankfurt.

05:46.764 --> 05:47.723
That reminds me.

05:47.765 --> 05:48.891
Call the Frankfurt plant
and have them ship us...

05:48.932 --> 05:50.309
another 100,000 bottles.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.478
People keep smuggling Cokes
into the eastern sector...

05:52.561 --> 05:53.479
and not returning the empties.

05:53.562 --> 05:54.563
Yes, sir.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.273
Next, I'm expecting the Russian
Trade Commission at 10:30.

05:56.357 --> 05:57.441
When they get here,
show them right in.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.442
Yes, sir.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.568
Next. Schlemmer, you're fired.

05:59.651 --> 06:00.569
Sir?

06:00.652 --> 06:02.571
Unless you stop clicking
your heels around here!

06:02.654 --> 06:05.407
Yes, sir. Oh, I'm sorry.
I keep forgetting myself.

06:05.449 --> 06:06.784
That old Gestapo training, huh?

06:06.867 --> 06:08.660
Please, Mr. MacNamara.
You mustn't say that.

06:08.744 --> 06:09.661
It is not true.

06:09.745 --> 06:12.081
Just between us, Schlemmer,
what did you do during the war?

06:12.122 --> 06:13.290
I was in der untergrund...

06:13.374 --> 06:14.291
The underground.

06:14.375 --> 06:15.292
Resistance fighter?

06:15.376 --> 06:16.668
No. Motorman.
In the underground.

06:16.752 --> 06:17.711
You know, the subway.

06:17.753 --> 06:19.797
Of course, you were anti-Nazi,
and you never liked Adolf.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.090
Adolf who?

06:21.173 --> 06:22.466
You see, down where I was...

06:22.549 --> 06:23.884
I didn't know what
was going on out there...

06:23.926 --> 06:25.344
and nobody ever told me
anything.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.637
That'll be all, Schlemmer.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.097
Herausmachen!

06:57.000 --> 06:58.252
Guten Morgen, MacNamara.

06:58.293 --> 07:00.295
And a guten Morgen to you,
Fräulein Ingeborg.

07:00.379 --> 07:01.296
It is not "frow-line."

07:01.380 --> 07:04.049
It is "froy-line"
with an umlaut.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.468
I'll say. Monthly report.

07:06.552 --> 07:09.054
To Wendell P. Hazeltine,
home office, Atlanta, Georgia.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.640
From C.R. MacNamara,
Berlin branch.

07:11.723 --> 07:12.891
Production figures were made.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.935
270,000 cases.

07:15.018 --> 07:18.230
Consumption per capita
now 5.2% above last year.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.274
Outselling Rhine wine
eight to one.

07:20.357 --> 07:22.568
Rapidly creeping up
on draft beer.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.445
Next, publicity campaign...

07:24.528 --> 07:27.448
to reorient German
businessmen's lunch succeeding.

07:27.531 --> 07:30.617
27% now having Coke
with their knackwurst.

07:30.701 --> 07:33.036
Now, here's a real hot flash.

07:33.078 --> 07:35.414
We may become
the first American company...

07:35.456 --> 07:37.124
to crack the Iron Curtain.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.251
I have started
preliminary negotiations...

07:39.293 --> 07:40.794
with a Russian representative.

07:40.878 --> 07:43.172
It looks most promising.
More later.

07:43.255 --> 07:44.256
Next...

07:45.132 --> 07:46.717
what did you do
over the weekend?

07:46.758 --> 07:48.594
Nothing.
I stayed home waiting for you.

07:48.677 --> 07:49.761
I tried to make it, believe me.

07:49.845 --> 07:51.096
I just couldn't get away...

07:51.180 --> 07:53.807
but there's good news tonight.

07:53.891 --> 07:56.268
Yes? Mrs. MacNamara?

07:56.351 --> 07:57.519
Put her on.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.689
Yes, Phyllis.
What's the matter?

08:00.731 --> 08:02.900
It's Tommy. We're having
a little crisis here.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.776
Why don't you talk to him?

08:04.860 --> 08:06.904
Tommy, your father's
on the phone.

08:08.572 --> 08:10.616
Hello, Dad. Nothing.

08:10.699 --> 08:12.493
It's just that Mother's
ganging up on me.

08:12.576 --> 08:14.161
What do you mean by that?

08:14.244 --> 08:16.038
I think your mother's
absolutely right.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.289
It's silly to pack them.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.707
What are you going to do
with roller skates in Venice?

08:18.749 --> 08:19.917
All the streets are underwater.

08:19.958 --> 08:23.921
So what? I'm taking my aqualung
and my snorkel.

08:23.962 --> 08:26.798
Here. Your husband
wants to talk to you.

08:30.469 --> 08:31.470
Yes, Mac?

08:31.595 --> 08:33.889
Look, Phyllis.
Let him pack what he wants.

08:33.931 --> 08:35.474
All right. So I'm spoiling him.

08:35.557 --> 08:36.475
Big deal.

08:36.558 --> 08:37.476
Don't worry.

08:37.558 --> 08:38.477
The car will be there at 5:00.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.477
Then you'll pick me up
at the office...

08:39.561 --> 08:40.687
and I'll take you
to the airport.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.231
Yes, mein Führer.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.398
Bertha wants to know
what you'd like...

08:43.440 --> 08:44.775
to have for dinner tonight.

08:44.858 --> 08:45.817
Oh, tell her not to bother.

08:45.901 --> 08:46.902
I've got a desk full of work.

08:46.985 --> 08:48.570
I'll just grab
a quick bite somewhere.

08:48.654 --> 08:49.655
So long, dear.

08:50.364 --> 08:52.115
Like I said, good news.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.617
Your wife. She's making a trip?

08:53.700 --> 08:54.743
Is she ever.

08:54.826 --> 08:56.370
Going on vacation
mit die Kinder.

08:56.411 --> 08:57.412
Ach so.

08:57.454 --> 08:58.705
So tonight,
we'll split a schnitzel...

08:58.747 --> 09:00.332
and start
on the German lessons again.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.125
We should.
You must be getting rusty.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.253
We'll just have to work at it
twice as hard from now on.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.254
Das ist gut?

09:05.295 --> 09:06.255
Sehr gut.

09:06.296 --> 09:09.132
And the first thing we're gonna
do is brush up on the umlaut.

09:09.216 --> 09:12.928
Das ist wunderbar.

09:12.970 --> 09:16.348
Like all the lilacs
in Lower Bavaria.

09:18.100 --> 09:20.060
The Communist gentlemen
are here.

09:20.102 --> 09:21.061
Send them in.

09:21.103 --> 09:22.479
That'll be all,
Fräulein Ingeborg.

09:22.521 --> 09:24.064
Put that on the teletype
to Atlanta.

09:24.147 --> 09:25.107
Jawohl.

09:25.190 --> 09:26.275
And take your gum.

09:26.358 --> 09:27.401
Jawohl.

09:34.366 --> 09:35.742
Nice to see you again,
Comrade Mishkin.

09:35.826 --> 09:36.994
Hey, Mishkin.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.829
Ah, Mr. MacNamara...

09:38.912 --> 09:41.206
I would like to present
Commissar Peripetchikoff...

09:41.248 --> 09:42.833
Chairman of our
Trade Commission...

09:42.916 --> 09:43.917
and Comrade Borodenko...

09:43.959 --> 09:46.253
from the Soft Drinks
Secretariat.

09:46.295 --> 09:48.088
Sit down.

09:48.171 --> 09:49.256
Sit down, boys.

09:49.298 --> 09:50.966
We have no objection.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.175
Cigarettes? Cigars?

09:52.259 --> 09:53.468
Here. Take one of these.

09:53.552 --> 09:54.636
Thanks.

09:55.345 --> 09:56.263
Made in Havana.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.140
We have trade agreement
with Cuba.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.100
They send us cigars,
we send them rockets.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.268
Good thinking.

10:01.351 --> 10:02.394
Now, I understand
from Comrade Mishkin...

10:02.436 --> 10:03.562
that you guys are very keen...

10:03.687 --> 10:05.105
on getting Coca-Cola
into Russia.

10:05.188 --> 10:06.565
He is totally wrong.

10:06.648 --> 10:07.983
I did not say we are keen.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.235
I said we are mildly interested.

10:10.319 --> 10:11.528
Nevertheless...

10:13.363 --> 10:15.574
Comrade Mishkin suggested we
start with 6 bottling plants...

10:15.616 --> 10:18.410
Moscow, Leningrad,
Stalingrad, Kiev...

10:20.412 --> 10:22.247
You know something?
You guys got cheated.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.582
This is a pretty crummy cigar.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.083
Do not worry.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.586
We send them
pretty crummy rockets.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.593
As I was saying, six plants...

10:34.676 --> 10:36.553
Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad...

10:36.595 --> 10:38.305
Kiev, Kharkov, and Minsk, right?

10:38.388 --> 10:39.389
Totally wrong.

10:39.431 --> 10:40.432
I never mentioned Minsk.

10:40.515 --> 10:41.600
I said Pinsk.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.685
All right.
Pinsk is in. Minsk is out.

10:43.769 --> 10:46.229
Next, our contract will contain
the usual provisions.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.023
We supply the syrup,
you do the bottling.

10:48.065 --> 10:49.024
Certainly not.

10:49.066 --> 10:52.194
We make our own syrup.
You supply the formula.

10:52.235 --> 10:53.487
Forget it, gentlemen.

10:53.570 --> 10:54.863
That formula
stays in our vaults.

10:54.905 --> 10:56.281
We give it to you,
first thing we know...

10:56.365 --> 10:57.741
the Chinese Communists
will have it.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.744
No formula, no deal.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.371
OK. No deal.

11:02.412 --> 11:03.914
We do not need you.

11:03.955 --> 11:06.541
If we want Coca-Cola,
we invent it ourselves.

11:06.583 --> 11:07.542
Oh, yeah?

11:07.584 --> 11:09.586
In 1956, you flew
a bottle of Coke...

11:09.628 --> 11:11.838
to a secret
laboratory in Sverdlovsk.

11:11.922 --> 11:12.923
A dozen of your top chemists...

11:12.964 --> 11:15.550
went nuts trying to analyze
the ingredients, right?

11:15.592 --> 11:16.760
No comment.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.221
And in 1958, you planted
two undercover agents...

11:19.262 --> 11:21.765
in our home office in Atlanta
to steal the formula...

11:21.848 --> 11:22.808
and what happened?

11:22.891 --> 11:24.101
They both defected...

11:24.142 --> 11:26.103
and now they're successful
businessmen in Florida...

11:26.144 --> 11:28.480
packaging
instant borscht, right?

11:28.563 --> 11:29.815
No comment.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.858
Last year, you put out
a cockamamie imitation...

11:31.900 --> 11:33.402
Kremlin Cola.

11:33.485 --> 11:34.903
You tried it out in
the satellite countries...

11:34.986 --> 11:36.822
but even the Albanians
wouldn't drink it.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.491
They used it
for sheep-dip, right?

11:39.574 --> 11:40.784
No comment.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.829
So either get down to business
or get off the pot.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.539
My dear American friend...

11:45.580 --> 11:48.250
if we are to live together
in peaceful coexistence...

11:48.333 --> 11:50.377
there must be a certain amount
of give-and-take.

11:50.419 --> 11:52.003
Oh, sure.
We give, and you take.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.880
What is the matter?
You do not trust us?

11:54.923 --> 11:56.133
No comment.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.219
If you do not mind,
we'll have a little conference.

11:59.261 --> 12:00.679
Help yourself.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.239
What is this?

12:21.867 --> 12:23.285
My employees gave it to me...

12:23.368 --> 12:25.162
on the tenth anniversary
of the Berlin Airlift.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.039
Comrades,
are we going to stand here...

12:28.081 --> 12:29.916
and listen to this
cheap propaganda?

12:29.958 --> 12:31.710
Relax, Boris.

12:31.835 --> 12:34.254
While they're putting
Uncle Sam in cuckoo clocks...

12:34.296 --> 12:37.257
we will put
Soviet cosmonaut on moon.

12:37.299 --> 12:39.885
OK. So you guys may be the first
to shoot a man to the moon...

12:39.926 --> 12:41.261
but if he wants
a Coke on the way...

12:41.344 --> 12:43.096
you'll have to come to us.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.231
All right.
We agree in principle.

12:53.315 --> 12:54.566
You supply the syrup.

12:54.608 --> 12:57.068
Next, the deal will be set up
on a royalty basis.

12:57.152 --> 12:58.487
Royalty?

12:58.570 --> 13:00.238
In Russia,
we do not have royalty...

13:00.322 --> 13:02.115
not since we liquidate
the Czar.

13:02.199 --> 13:04.576
Nevertheless, you'll pay us
a percentage of the gross.

13:04.659 --> 13:05.744
- Money?
- Dollars.

13:05.827 --> 13:08.455
Instead of dollars, you would
accept three-week tour...

13:08.538 --> 13:09.915
of Bolshoi Ballet.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.958
Please. No culture, just cash.

13:12.042 --> 13:14.669
The ugly American.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.547
Next, once the plants are up...

13:17.589 --> 13:18.757
we reserve the right
of inspection.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.926
Of course, and we reserve
the right to veto.

13:20.967 --> 13:21.927
Our inspections will be
entitled to...

13:22.010 --> 13:24.763
- We veto it.
- I thought so.

13:24.846 --> 13:26.223
Forget details.

13:26.264 --> 13:27.557
You will draw up
temporary agreement...

13:27.599 --> 13:28.600
we will submit to Moscow.

13:28.683 --> 13:30.602
And I'll have to consult
with Atlanta, Georgia.

13:30.685 --> 13:31.937
When will papers be ready?

13:31.978 --> 13:33.563
I'll put my secretary
right to work on it.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.899
Your secretary?
She's that blond lady?

13:35.941 --> 13:37.400
That's the one.

13:40.195 --> 13:41.738
You will send papers
to East Berlin...

13:41.780 --> 13:43.657
with blond lady in triplicate.

13:43.740 --> 13:44.783
You want the papers
in triplicate...

13:44.866 --> 13:46.117
or the blond in triplicate?

13:46.201 --> 13:47.577
See what you can do.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.746
We are staying
at the Grand Hotel Potemkin.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.748
OK. Now, how about
a little vodka and Coke?

13:51.790 --> 13:52.874
No, thank you.

13:52.916 --> 13:55.752
We have emergency meeting
with Swiss trade delegation.

13:55.794 --> 13:58.588
They sent us
twenty carloads of cheese.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.590
Totally unacceptable.
Full of holes.

14:00.674 --> 14:01.675
Good-bye.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.761
See you around the campus.

14:21.069 --> 14:23.029
Ring a ding ding.

14:32.956 --> 14:34.040
What is it, Schlemmer?

14:34.082 --> 14:35.500
It is the overseas operator.

14:35.584 --> 14:38.044
You are to stand by for a call
from Atlanta, Georgia.

14:38.086 --> 14:40.380
Atlanta? They must
have gotten my teletype.

14:40.422 --> 14:42.257
I bet they're all worked up
about the Russian deal.

14:42.340 --> 14:43.758
- It went good?
- Good?

14:43.800 --> 14:44.843
Look at this, Schlemmer.

14:44.926 --> 14:46.553
All virgin territory...

14:46.595 --> 14:48.847
300 million thirsty comrades...

14:48.930 --> 14:50.265
Volga boatmen and Cossacks...

14:50.348 --> 14:52.100
Ukrainians
and Outer Mongolians...

14:52.142 --> 14:54.560
panting for the pause
that refreshes.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.022
Do you realize what it means
if I could put this across?

14:57.063 --> 14:58.356
Your stock, it will go up.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.400
I'll go up
to the number-one job...

15:00.483 --> 15:01.818
Head of all
European operations...

15:01.902 --> 15:03.028
headquarters in London.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.905
May I be the first
to congratulate you?

15:04.946 --> 15:06.281
I should have had
that job five years ago.

15:06.364 --> 15:07.324
I was all set for it...

15:07.407 --> 15:08.867
even bought myself
an umbrella...

15:08.909 --> 15:11.494
but I got loused up
by Benny Goodman.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.579
Benny Goodman?

15:12.621 --> 15:15.332
I was in charge
of the whole Middle East...

15:15.415 --> 15:19.044
Nine countries, fifteen bottling
plants, all facing Mecca.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.503
Well, Goodman and his band
were coming through...

15:20.587 --> 15:23.131
on a goodwill tour
for the State Department.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.592
30,000 people showed up
at the concert...

15:25.675 --> 15:27.385
but Benny didn't
because his plane was delayed...

15:27.427 --> 15:29.888
by a sandstorm,
so the mob rioted...

15:29.971 --> 15:31.556
and marched
on the American embassy...

15:31.598 --> 15:32.974
so the police
turned them back...

15:33.058 --> 15:35.143
so they burned down
the Coca-Cola plant.

15:35.769 --> 15:36.686
You know it.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.146
There was a big rhubarb
at the home office...

15:38.229 --> 15:40.065
and suddenly,
I was in the doghouse...

15:40.106 --> 15:41.775
exiled to South America...

15:41.858 --> 15:43.818
schlepping that syrup
over the Andes...

15:43.902 --> 15:45.236
on llamas yet...

15:45.320 --> 15:46.613
while a bunch
of crew-cut kids...

15:46.696 --> 15:47.989
were being promoted
over my head!

15:48.073 --> 15:49.157
But you're in Berlin now.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.450
This is not the doghouse.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.243
Yeah. I used to
have nine countries.

15:52.285 --> 15:55.372
Now I've got half a city,
and that may blow up any day...

15:55.413 --> 15:58.917
but MacNamara rides again!

15:59.000 --> 16:00.877
I'll be
the white-haired boy now.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.379
I'm going all the way!

16:02.420 --> 16:05.006
Yes? It's Atlanta.

16:05.090 --> 16:07.175
Hello? Hello?
Mr. Hazeltine?

16:07.258 --> 16:08.593
Yes, I can hear you.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.512
I'm fine, Mr. Hazeltine.
How are you?

16:10.595 --> 16:12.263
Well, if you must know,
I'm miserable.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.015
Those damn magnolias
are in bloom again...

16:14.099 --> 16:15.934
and so is my hay fever.

16:16.017 --> 16:17.644
MacNamara, there's
something important...

16:17.727 --> 16:19.312
I'd like to discuss with you.

16:19.354 --> 16:21.189
I thought you would,
Mr. Hazeltine.

16:21.231 --> 16:22.482
You got my teletype?

16:22.565 --> 16:23.733
It's right here in front of me.

16:23.775 --> 16:25.402
Those figures from May
are not bad...

16:25.485 --> 16:26.528
not bad at all.

16:26.569 --> 16:27.529
Thank you, sir.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.072
And how about the Russian deal?

16:29.155 --> 16:30.949
Napoleon blew it,
Hitler blew it...

16:31.032 --> 16:32.909
but Coca-Cola's
gonna pull it off.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.911
Forget it, MacNamara.
Forget it.

16:34.953 --> 16:36.830
We are not interested
in doing business...

16:36.913 --> 16:37.998
behind the Iron Curtain.

16:38.081 --> 16:40.125
We're not interested
in the Russian market?

16:40.208 --> 16:42.669
I wouldn't touch the Russians
with a ten-foot pole...

16:42.752 --> 16:45.213
and I don't want anything to do
with the Poles, either.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.756
But this could be the biggest
thing for the company...

16:46.840 --> 16:48.925
since we introduced
the six-pack!

16:50.301 --> 16:52.429
Well, if it's against
front-office policy...

16:52.512 --> 16:53.513
You're damn right...

16:53.596 --> 16:55.056
but that's not what
I called you about.

16:55.098 --> 16:56.099
Look, MacNamara.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.351
I'd like you to do me
a big personal favor.

16:58.435 --> 16:59.769
Yes, Mr. Hazeltine?

16:59.811 --> 17:00.979
You want me to ship
Mrs. Hazeltine...

17:01.062 --> 17:02.522
another set of Misen china?

17:02.564 --> 17:04.482
No! It's about our daughter
Scarlett.

17:04.566 --> 17:06.734
She's seventeen now,
sweet girl...

17:06.776 --> 17:09.069
fell in love with some
damn rock'n'roll singer.

17:09.112 --> 17:11.071
No. That was the one before.

17:11.156 --> 17:13.950
This is some pimple-faced
basketball player.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.202
Anyway, we sent her off
on a little trip to Europe.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.329
Where was I?

17:18.413 --> 17:20.790
Daughter Scarlett, pimple-faced
basketball player...

17:20.874 --> 17:22.000
sent her to Europe...

17:22.083 --> 17:23.001
Oh, yes!

17:23.084 --> 17:24.210
We had her spend
a couple of weeks...

17:24.252 --> 17:25.587
with our representative
in Rome...

17:25.627 --> 17:27.422
and a couple of weeks
with our man in Paris...

17:27.464 --> 17:29.591
and she's arriving
in Berlin this afternoon...

17:29.674 --> 17:32.343
so I'd appreciate it
if you and Mrs. MacNamara...

17:32.427 --> 17:33.762
Oh, we'd be delighted
to have her stay with us.

17:33.845 --> 17:36.097
It's just that
my family has made some plans...

17:36.181 --> 17:38.767
and I have a few plans
of my own.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.894
Well, if it's any sort
of imposition, never mind.

17:40.935 --> 17:42.520
I'm sorry I called you.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.898
Well, actually, I wasn't
thinking of myself.

17:44.939 --> 17:46.691
It's your daughter
I'm concerned about.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.943
With the political situation
in Berlin the way it is...

17:49.027 --> 17:50.904
anything can happen anytime.

17:50.987 --> 17:51.905
Exactly.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.032
That's why I want you to take
especially good care of her.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.533
She's just a child, really...

17:55.575 --> 17:57.368
and I don't like her
to stay in a hotel alone...

17:57.410 --> 17:58.578
at a time like this.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.080
She's flying Pan Am.

18:00.121 --> 18:02.749
The plane is due
in Berlin at 4:30...

18:02.791 --> 18:05.293
unless those damn Commies
shoot it down.

18:27.649 --> 18:29.567
Here.
You give her the flowers.

18:29.651 --> 18:30.735
Oh, cut it out, Phyllis!

18:30.819 --> 18:31.903
What was I going to do?

18:31.986 --> 18:33.530
The boss asked me to look
after his only daughter.

18:33.571 --> 18:34.781
I can't disappoint him.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.116
Well, what about
your only children...

18:36.199 --> 18:37.242
and your only wife?

18:37.325 --> 18:38.827
We were all packed
and ready to go.

18:38.910 --> 18:39.911
Don't you think
we were disappointed?

18:39.994 --> 18:41.913
Believe me, Phyllis,
everybody's disappointed.

18:41.996 --> 18:43.289
We'll just have to put things
off a couple of weeks...

18:43.373 --> 18:44.749
The roller skates
and the snorkel and the umlaut.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.084
The what?

18:46.167 --> 18:47.418
Right now, the important thing
is to make sure...

18:47.460 --> 18:49.420
that the girl has a good time
so when she goes home...

18:49.504 --> 18:51.714
all she'll talk about
is our man in Berlin.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.216
It's such a nuisance.

18:53.258 --> 18:55.051
Tommy will have to move
into Cindy's room.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.845
Bertha will have to learn
how to cook sauerbraten...

18:56.928 --> 18:58.054
southern style.

18:58.096 --> 18:59.347
Come on, Phyllis.
Make an effort.

18:59.430 --> 19:01.099
Yes, mein Führer.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.490
Pardon me, is this the plane
from Paris?

19:17.574 --> 19:18.700
Oui, monsieur.

19:18.741 --> 19:19.993
Isn't there a Miss Hazeltine
among the passengers?

19:20.076 --> 19:22.078
There was a Miss Hazeltine
among the passengers...

19:22.120 --> 19:23.079
but we have lost her.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.080
You lost her?

19:24.122 --> 19:25.456
She has joined the crew.

19:33.214 --> 19:36.759
Scarlett Hazeltine
if I ever saw one.

19:38.595 --> 19:39.929
Miss Hazeltine, I'm MacNamara.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.514
This is Mrs. MacNamara.
Welcome to Berlin.

19:41.598 --> 19:42.807
Hi there!

19:42.891 --> 19:43.933
How was your flight?

19:43.975 --> 19:45.226
Just marvy.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.770
The boys let me
buzz Dusseldorf.

19:48.563 --> 19:49.856
May I have your hat?

19:49.898 --> 19:51.399
OK, fans. Drop them in.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.152
Pick one, will you, please?

19:54.235 --> 19:55.153
I'm game.

19:55.236 --> 19:56.154
What does it say?

19:56.237 --> 19:57.155
It says Pierre.

19:57.238 --> 19:58.156
That's me!

19:58.239 --> 19:59.157
Where do I come to pick you up?

19:59.240 --> 20:00.283
- What's our address?
- Why?

20:00.366 --> 20:02.869
Well, we just had this lottery,
and Pierre won me.

20:02.911 --> 20:03.870
Lucky Pierre.

20:03.912 --> 20:05.288
He's the navigator.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.081
That so? Well, you better
change your course, Lucky.

20:07.123 --> 20:09.417
You're way off the beam.
This way, Miss Hazeltine.

20:09.459 --> 20:10.877
Now just a darn minute.

20:10.919 --> 20:12.003
So long, fans!

20:12.086 --> 20:13.338
But that's not fair!

20:13.421 --> 20:16.174
Madame, I appeal to you
as a woman.

20:16.257 --> 20:18.134
As a matter of fact, you do.

20:18.176 --> 20:19.344
Au revoir.

20:20.136 --> 20:21.304
So you're gonna be like that?

20:21.387 --> 20:22.305
Like what?

20:22.388 --> 20:25.516
A company man like those
old poops in Rome and Paris...

20:25.600 --> 20:28.060
breathing down my neck
every minute, cramping my style.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.020
Look, Miss Hazeltine.

20:29.062 --> 20:30.438
You're underage,
and I'm under orders!

20:30.521 --> 20:32.023
Europe... what a drag!

20:32.065 --> 20:34.525
I've done the Colosseum bit
and the Mona Lisa bit...

20:34.567 --> 20:37.028
but they never take me
to any of those marvy places...

20:37.070 --> 20:39.864
like the Lido
and the Crazy Horse and Le Sexy.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.075
I promise you, you'll have
a wonderful time in Berlin.

20:42.158 --> 20:43.117
That's why I came.

20:43.201 --> 20:44.619
I hear this is
a real swinging town.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.079
Where did you hear that?

20:46.162 --> 20:47.580
Don't you ever
read the headlines?

20:47.622 --> 20:49.249
Everybody says Berlin's
the hottest spot...

20:49.332 --> 20:50.792
in the world right now.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.209
Would you care to make
a short statement...

20:52.210 --> 20:53.503
for the American Forces
Network?

20:53.586 --> 20:54.587
Phyllis, please!

20:54.629 --> 20:56.381
We're a little late, folks,
so good night.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.423
This your ticket?

20:57.465 --> 20:58.841
Fritz, with the luggage machen.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.593
You'd better send
a cable to Tara...

21:00.677 --> 21:02.011
and tell them
Scarlett's checked in.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.763
Don't bother. Let them worry.

21:03.846 --> 21:05.598
I didn't volunteer
for this trip.

21:05.682 --> 21:08.685
They deported me just to bust it
up between me and Choo Choo.

21:08.768 --> 21:09.769
Who's Choo Choo?

21:09.811 --> 21:10.812
Choo Choo Babcock.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.355
I met him
in a telephone booth.

21:12.397 --> 21:15.692
43 of us piled inside...
You know, to break the record...

21:15.733 --> 21:17.235
And Choo Choo and I
were on the bottom...

21:17.318 --> 21:20.029
and by the time we got out,
we were engaged.

21:20.071 --> 21:22.031
That's a record, all right.

21:22.073 --> 21:24.242
But Daddy didn't approve
because Choo Choo's folks...

21:24.284 --> 21:26.202
are from the wrong side
of the tracks...

21:26.244 --> 21:29.372
and let's face it,
my daddy's an S-N-O-B.

21:29.414 --> 21:30.415
A what?

21:30.456 --> 21:31.749
- A snob.
- Oh.

21:31.833 --> 21:34.002
Seventeen. Isn't that a little
young to be engaged?

21:34.085 --> 21:35.920
Oh, I've been
engaged four times.

21:36.004 --> 21:38.756
All the women in our family
are sort of hot-blooded.

21:39.882 --> 21:42.093
What have we got here?

21:42.176 --> 21:45.221
Whatever it is, it's all ours
for the next two weeks.

21:45.263 --> 21:46.806
Isn't that marvy?

22:10.163 --> 22:11.164
Schlemmer!

22:15.918 --> 22:18.004
I'm sorry. I will keep them
here after hours practicing.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.088
Never mind that.

22:19.130 --> 22:20.423
My chauffeur didn't
show up this morning.

22:20.465 --> 22:22.300
Fritz? I will find out
what happened to him.

22:22.383 --> 22:23.384
I don't care
what happened to him.

22:23.426 --> 22:24.635
Find out what happened
to my car.

22:24.719 --> 22:25.803
Jawohl!

22:25.887 --> 22:26.804
I'm sorry.

22:26.888 --> 22:28.222
While they are
practicing not standing...

22:28.264 --> 22:30.391
I will practice
not clicking my heels.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.397
Guten Morgen, Fräulein Ingeborg.

22:36.439 --> 22:37.398
Guten Morgen.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.734
Like freshly baked pumpernickel.

22:39.776 --> 22:40.735
Here's your mail.

22:40.818 --> 22:41.778
Here's your
"Wall Street Journal"...

22:41.861 --> 22:43.780
and here is my resignation.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.406
Resignation?
What are you talking about?

22:45.490 --> 22:46.949
Now you do not work me
overtime anymore.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.951
You do not take advantage
of me on weekends.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.245
You have lost all interest
in the umlaut...

22:51.329 --> 22:54.040
so, obviously, my services
are no longer required here.

22:54.082 --> 22:56.084
You know my problem.
We have this houseguest.

22:56.125 --> 22:57.877
You said she would
be in Berlin two weeks.

22:57.919 --> 22:59.629
Can I help it if she caught
the German measles?

22:59.712 --> 23:01.089
She's been here now two months.

23:01.172 --> 23:02.090
She likes it here.

23:02.173 --> 23:03.966
It's a damn nuisance, but what
am I gonna do, throw her out?

23:04.050 --> 23:05.093
Doesn't she have to go home?

23:05.176 --> 23:06.803
It's August.
Won't schools soon open?

23:06.886 --> 23:08.596
In Georgia? You never know.

23:08.679 --> 23:09.764
Come on now.

23:09.806 --> 23:10.932
What is all this nonsense
about quitting?

23:10.973 --> 23:12.141
I have had offers for many jobs.

23:12.225 --> 23:13.768
After all, I'm bilingual.

23:13.851 --> 23:14.769
Don't I know it.

23:14.852 --> 23:16.354
Remember that Russian
Trade Commission?

23:16.437 --> 23:17.855
They keep calling me
all the time.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.065
They want me very badly.

23:19.107 --> 23:20.942
I'll bet,
those Siberian wolves.

23:21.025 --> 23:23.152
So you better
find yourself another girl.

23:23.236 --> 23:24.487
All right!

23:25.988 --> 23:27.490
Dictation.

23:30.576 --> 23:33.246
Classified ad to run
in all Berlin papers.

23:33.329 --> 23:34.247
Quote...

23:34.330 --> 23:36.082
"Attractive
middle-aged executive...

23:36.165 --> 23:38.375
"wants attractive,
young secretary."

23:38.376 --> 23:40.920
"Must be versatile
and cooperative."

23:40.962 --> 23:44.132
"Excellent salary,
congenial working conditions..."

23:44.215 --> 23:46.259
"Fringe benefits."

23:46.342 --> 23:49.554
Fringe benefits? What is that?

23:49.595 --> 23:51.055
Little extras...

23:51.097 --> 23:52.473
like, for instance,
this morning...

23:52.557 --> 23:55.101
I was passing that fancy shop
on the Kurfuerstendamm...

23:55.184 --> 23:56.602
and there was this white
silk dress in the window...

23:56.644 --> 23:58.688
with polka dots all over it
and a matching hat.

23:58.729 --> 24:00.815
And a bag?
And matching shoes?

24:00.898 --> 24:02.692
Why not?

24:02.733 --> 24:03.693
I'll take the job.

24:03.734 --> 24:05.153
You got it.

24:05.236 --> 24:06.154
Danke schön.

24:06.237 --> 24:07.488
You're welcome.

24:10.783 --> 24:13.035
Please. Not while
you're chewing gum.

24:17.248 --> 24:18.833
Uh, that'll be all,
Fräulein Ingeborg.

24:18.916 --> 24:20.918
- More later.
- Anytime.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.086
Yes, Schlemmer?

24:22.128 --> 24:24.213
I called the garage.
I called his wife.

24:24.255 --> 24:25.381
No Fritz.

24:25.423 --> 24:26.757
I can see this is going
to be one of those days.

24:26.799 --> 24:27.842
You better call the police.

24:27.925 --> 24:28.843
I already did.

24:28.926 --> 24:30.428
Gave them a complete description
of the car...

24:30.511 --> 24:32.722
Model, license number,
engine number.

24:32.763 --> 24:33.764
You're a good man, Schlemmer.

24:33.806 --> 24:34.765
Thank you, sir.

24:34.807 --> 24:35.766
Schlemmer, how much
are we paying you?

24:35.808 --> 24:36.767
Two hundred marks a week.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.436
Let's see. That would be
about fifty dollars.

24:38.561 --> 24:39.770
- That's all.
- That's enough.

24:39.854 --> 24:40.855
Yes, sir.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.234
Hello? Hello? Yes?

24:45.276 --> 24:47.570
Atlanta, Georgia?
Put it through.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.697
MacNamara, what's going on
there in Berlin?

24:49.739 --> 24:51.407
I have a letter here
from Scarlett.

24:51.449 --> 24:54.827
It says she's been going
to operas, concerts, museums.

24:54.911 --> 24:56.829
That doesn't sound
like my little girl.

24:56.913 --> 24:58.873
Oh, you're going to be
surprised, Mr. Hazeltine.

24:58.915 --> 25:00.625
She's a different person now.

25:00.708 --> 25:01.834
Oh, I don't mind telling you.

25:01.918 --> 25:03.461
We were a little worried
when she first arrived...

25:03.544 --> 25:05.004
but she turned out just fine.

25:05.087 --> 25:07.340
Well, I'll be damned!

25:07.423 --> 25:08.758
Anyway, you'll be
relieved to know...

25:08.799 --> 25:11.302
that Mrs. Hazeltine and I
are leaving for Europe today...

25:11.385 --> 25:13.471
and we're going to take
Scarlett off your hands.

25:13.554 --> 25:14.680
We'll be sorry to lose her.

25:14.764 --> 25:16.766
No, it was no bother at all.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.060
Two weeks, two months.
What's the difference?

25:19.101 --> 25:20.186
Well, I want you to know...

25:20.269 --> 25:22.230
that we're mighty grateful
to you, MacNamara.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.898
Actually, the reason
I'm making this trip...

25:23.981 --> 25:25.900
There's gonna be
a shift in personnel.

25:25.983 --> 25:28.236
We're naming a new head
of European operations...

25:28.277 --> 25:30.655
and you won't be forgotten, Mac.

25:30.738 --> 25:32.448
The London job?

25:32.532 --> 25:35.117
Well, I don't know what to say.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.411
I never expected
anything like that.

25:37.495 --> 25:39.080
Just to be considered
for the job...

25:39.163 --> 25:40.081
is a great honor.

25:40.164 --> 25:41.123
Of course, I have been
with the company...

25:41.207 --> 25:42.500
for the past fifteen years...

25:42.583 --> 25:45.086
and I know the European market
like the inside of my pocket...

25:45.127 --> 25:46.087
It's your wife
on the other phone.

25:46.128 --> 25:47.088
She must talk to you.

25:47.171 --> 25:48.089
Not now.
I'm on long distance.

25:48.172 --> 25:49.757
I told her that,
but she insists.

25:49.799 --> 25:51.217
Would you hold on a minute,
Mr. Hazeltine?

25:51.259 --> 25:54.011
There's a little emergency
in the accounting department.

25:55.096 --> 25:56.973
What is it, Phyllis?
What's so important?

25:57.056 --> 25:59.433
Well, if you put it that way,
nothing, really.

25:59.517 --> 26:00.810
I just thought
you might be interested...

26:00.893 --> 26:03.396
in what's going on
around the house, mein Führer.

26:03.479 --> 26:04.689
You out of your mind?

26:04.730 --> 26:07.024
I'm talking to Mr. Hazeltine
about the London job...

26:07.066 --> 26:08.401
and you want to chitchat?

26:08.484 --> 26:09.402
I'm sorry.

26:09.485 --> 26:12.113
It's just that
Miss Hazeltine is missing...

26:12.196 --> 26:13.823
but we can discuss it
some other time.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.783
- Bye.
- Bye.

26:15.866 --> 26:17.827
Missing?!
Wait a minute, Phyllis.

26:17.910 --> 26:18.911
Phyllis!

26:18.995 --> 26:20.246
What do you mean she's missing?

26:20.329 --> 26:22.832
Bertha took her breakfast up,
and she's not there.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.458
Her bed hasn't been slept in.

26:24.542 --> 26:25.542
Well, that's ridiculous.

26:25.543 --> 26:26.752
We got back from the movie
around 11:00...

26:26.836 --> 26:28.546
and Scarlett
went right upstairs.

26:28.629 --> 26:29.547
What could have happened to her?

26:29.672 --> 26:32.008
Who knows? Gone with the wind.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.175
Maybe she ran away.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.553
Maybe she was kidnapped
by a white slave ring.

26:35.678 --> 26:37.179
Oh, swell.
Hold on, will you?

26:37.263 --> 26:38.264
Trouble?

26:38.306 --> 26:40.433
I wish I were in hell
with my back broken.

26:40.516 --> 26:41.559
Sorry, Mr. Hazeltine.

26:41.642 --> 26:43.935
They come running to me
with all their little problems.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.146
Now, about your trip.

26:45.229 --> 26:46.230
What boat are you sailing on?

26:46.314 --> 26:48.149
Boat? Who's got time for that?

26:48.232 --> 26:49.358
Mrs. Hazeltine and I...

26:49.400 --> 26:51.152
are flying to New York
this afternoon...

26:51.235 --> 26:52.862
taking the overnight jet
to London.

26:52.903 --> 26:54.530
There's a connecting
flight to Berlin...

26:54.572 --> 26:56.741
and we'll be there
at noon tomorrow.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.993
Noon tomorrow?
You mean our time?

26:59.076 --> 27:01.912
Of course I'll tell Scarlett,
first chance I get.

27:01.996 --> 27:02.913
Yes, sir.

27:02.997 --> 27:04.999
We'll see you at the airport
unless those damn Commies...

27:05.082 --> 27:06.250
shoot the plane down.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.085
Yeah. Auf Wiedersehen.

27:08.169 --> 27:10.421
For God's sake, Phyllis,
we've got to find that idiot.

27:10.463 --> 27:11.964
Her parents are arriving
tomorrow.

27:12.048 --> 27:13.341
Where could she be?

27:13.883 --> 27:16.469
She doesn't know anybody
in Berlin except us.

27:17.470 --> 27:18.679
Well, have Bertha look again.

27:18.763 --> 27:20.181
Maybe she left a note.

27:20.264 --> 27:22.266
What about her luggage?

27:22.308 --> 27:24.352
Well, I'm glad to hear
something is still there.

27:24.435 --> 27:26.395
No, I'm not blaming you.

27:26.479 --> 27:28.439
It's just that lousy
MacNamara luck.

27:28.522 --> 27:29.732
First I lost a bottling plant...

27:29.815 --> 27:31.817
and now I lose
the boss' daughter!

27:35.988 --> 27:37.156
I think
we are getting someplace.

27:37.239 --> 27:39.158
We found Fritz.

27:39.241 --> 27:41.243
Fritz? To hell with Fritz!

27:41.285 --> 27:43.245
It's the girl
we're looking for now.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.623
Precisely.
He has some information.

27:48.042 --> 27:49.126
Where is she?

27:49.210 --> 27:51.629
I do not know, not precisely...

27:51.754 --> 27:53.798
but last night, I dropped her
at the Brandenburg Gate.

27:53.881 --> 27:54.965
The Brandenburg Gate? Why?

27:55.049 --> 27:56.550
Because that is where
I drop her every night...

27:56.592 --> 27:58.177
and that is where I pick
her up every morning.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.262
How long has this been going on?

28:00.304 --> 28:01.764
Since last month, sir.

28:01.806 --> 28:02.932
Usually, I get her
back to the house...

28:02.973 --> 28:04.350
before you wake up,
but this morning...

28:04.433 --> 28:05.643
I wait for her, and I wait.

28:05.768 --> 28:07.561
You mean, you've been helping
her sneak out behind my back?

28:07.603 --> 28:09.522
Yes, sir, but I have
a very good excuse.

28:09.563 --> 28:10.523
What?

28:10.564 --> 28:11.607
She pays me
a hundred marks a night...

28:11.691 --> 28:13.526
Fifty for driving her,
fifty for not telling you.

28:13.567 --> 28:14.735
Do I have your permission
to fire him?

28:14.777 --> 28:16.070
Not yet!

28:16.112 --> 28:18.406
Now, let's go step by step.

28:18.447 --> 28:20.241
After you drop her
at the Brandenburg Gate...

28:20.282 --> 28:21.450
what does she do?

28:21.534 --> 28:24.328
She crosses the border
into East Berlin.

28:24.412 --> 28:25.413
East Berlin?

28:25.454 --> 28:26.539
That is why I am so worried...

28:26.580 --> 28:28.457
because this morning,
she did not come back.

28:28.541 --> 28:29.875
You're worried?

28:29.917 --> 28:32.628
I'm going down in flames,
and he's worried.

28:34.296 --> 28:36.424
Ingeborg, clear the switchboard.

28:36.507 --> 28:37.883
I want
Brigadier General Hartel...

28:37.925 --> 28:39.510
Commanding Officer
of the American sector.

28:39.593 --> 28:41.595
Next, get me Mayor Willy Brandt.

28:41.637 --> 28:42.596
Next, get me
the Police Commissioner...

28:42.680 --> 28:43.848
of West Berlin.

28:43.931 --> 28:46.392
Next, I want to speak
to the U.S. Ambassador in Bonn.

28:46.434 --> 28:47.977
You got that? OK.

28:49.186 --> 28:51.230
Fritz, you wait downstairs.
I may need you later.

28:51.313 --> 28:53.315
Schlemmer, how can we find out
what happened to her?

28:53.399 --> 28:55.443
Can we get any information
from East Berlin?

28:55.526 --> 28:57.069
Only through official channels
in triplicate.

28:57.153 --> 28:58.070
What if we just
picked up the phone...

28:58.154 --> 28:59.155
and called the authorities
over there?

28:59.238 --> 29:00.239
It is not that easy.

29:00.322 --> 29:01.240
Why not?

29:01.323 --> 29:03.325
There's no direct phone service
to East Berlin.

29:03.409 --> 29:04.326
You have to call Stockholm.

29:04.410 --> 29:05.494
From there it goes
through Warsaw...

29:05.578 --> 29:07.371
to Leipzig,
then to East Berlin...

29:07.413 --> 29:09.415
and then, nine times out of ten,
you get the wrong number.

29:09.457 --> 29:11.208
- Try it anyway.
- Yes, sir.

29:16.297 --> 29:17.298
Schnellmachen!

29:20.676 --> 29:22.178
Yes?

29:22.261 --> 29:24.263
General Hartel
is out on army maneuvers?

29:24.346 --> 29:26.515
Well, what about
Mayor Willy Brandt?

29:26.599 --> 29:27.850
He's watching the maneuvers.

29:27.933 --> 29:29.351
And the Police Commissioner?

29:29.435 --> 29:30.728
I see.
He's watching Willy Brandt.

29:30.811 --> 29:32.897
So who's minding the store?

29:32.938 --> 29:34.648
What about the call to Bonn?

29:34.732 --> 29:35.858
Our ambassador
is back in Washington...

29:35.900 --> 29:37.318
for consultation?

29:37.401 --> 29:38.903
Come in, come in.
I'll be right with you.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.279
Get me Washington,
the State Department...

29:40.362 --> 29:41.530
whoever answers...

29:41.572 --> 29:43.657
Dean Rusk, Dean Acheson,
Dean anybody.

29:43.741 --> 29:44.909
And if you have no luck there...

29:44.950 --> 29:46.535
get me Senator Talmadge
of Georgia...

29:46.577 --> 29:49.872
and if he isn't in,
try Huntley and Brinkley at NBC.

29:50.748 --> 29:51.916
Scarlett!

29:51.999 --> 29:53.834
What's all the excitement?

29:53.918 --> 29:56.086
Oh, nothing.

29:56.170 --> 29:57.630
You just scared
the hell out of us!

29:57.713 --> 29:58.714
You all right?

29:58.756 --> 30:00.508
I'm just marvy.

30:00.591 --> 30:01.884
What were you doing
in East Berlin?

30:01.926 --> 30:03.302
You mean, last night?

30:03.385 --> 30:05.304
I mean all those nights.

30:05.387 --> 30:07.681
You see, there's this boy
over there.

30:07.765 --> 30:09.016
Wow!

30:09.099 --> 30:10.643
What boy?
What have you been up to?

30:10.726 --> 30:13.020
Well, I met him
about six weeks ago.

30:13.062 --> 30:15.523
I went into East Berlin,
and there was this parade...

30:15.564 --> 30:17.233
and they wanted to arrest me.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.776
Arrest you?

30:18.859 --> 30:20.653
Because I was taking pictures.

30:20.736 --> 30:23.531
And then this boy...
He was in the parade...

30:23.572 --> 30:25.574
He said to the policemen
I shouldn't be arrested.

30:25.658 --> 30:29.745
I should be pitied because I was
a typical bourgeois parasite...

30:29.787 --> 30:33.749
and the rotten fruit
of a corrupt civilization.

30:33.791 --> 30:36.293
So naturally,
I fell in love with him.

30:36.377 --> 30:37.920
Naturally.

30:38.003 --> 30:39.672
Want to see his picture?

30:39.755 --> 30:40.798
Not particularly.

30:40.881 --> 30:42.925
Now, I want your honest opinion.

30:45.636 --> 30:47.888
Isn't he beautiful?

30:48.556 --> 30:51.267
You fell in love
with Khrushchev?

30:51.308 --> 30:55.020
No, silly, the one
that's carrying Khrushchev.

30:55.062 --> 30:57.064
His name's Otto.

30:57.106 --> 30:58.607
I finally got
East Berlin on the phone...

30:58.691 --> 31:01.235
and just like I told you,
wrong number.

31:01.318 --> 31:02.653
Hi there.

31:02.736 --> 31:03.946
Now, you and this Otto...

31:04.029 --> 31:06.240
exactly what do you do
when you're together?

31:06.323 --> 31:08.158
Oh, all kinds of goodies.

31:08.242 --> 31:11.078
I wash his shirts,
and he broadens my mind...

31:11.120 --> 31:13.747
and if it's a warm night,
we go lie on the roof...

31:13.789 --> 31:16.250
and watch the Sputniks go by.

31:16.333 --> 31:17.376
Is that all?

31:17.418 --> 31:20.296
Well, last night,
we were blowing up balloons.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.589
Balloons?

31:21.672 --> 31:23.007
You know.

31:25.843 --> 31:27.052
It's a Communist trick!

31:27.094 --> 31:29.430
When the wind is right,
they float them across...

31:29.471 --> 31:31.015
to undermine our morale.

31:32.725 --> 31:34.184
"Yankee go home"?

31:34.268 --> 31:37.229
They come in all colors...
Green and yellow and blue.

31:37.313 --> 31:38.230
You've been helping
this guy to spread...

31:38.314 --> 31:39.773
anti-American propaganda?

31:39.857 --> 31:43.027
It's not anti-American.
It's anti-Yankee...

31:43.068 --> 31:46.530
and where I come from,
everybody's against the Yankees.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.449
I have good mind to change
this to "Russki go home"...

31:48.532 --> 31:49.450
and when the wind blows
the other way...

31:49.533 --> 31:50.576
OK. OK.

31:50.659 --> 31:52.536
Now, you listen to me,
Scarlett Hazeltine.

31:52.578 --> 31:53.913
There's gonna be no more
of this foolishness...

31:53.996 --> 31:56.540
because tomorrow, your parents
are coming to take you home.

31:56.582 --> 31:57.875
They are?

31:59.209 --> 32:02.046
Who? Chet Huntley?

32:02.087 --> 32:03.255
All right. I'll speak to him.

32:03.339 --> 32:04.423
Hello, Mr. Huntley.

32:04.465 --> 32:05.883
I just want to tell you
I've been watching your program.

32:05.966 --> 32:07.593
Keep up the good work. Bye!

32:07.676 --> 32:08.719
Now, when your parents arrive...

32:08.761 --> 32:10.554
I want you to keep
your mouth shut...

32:10.596 --> 32:12.139
for your sake and mine...

32:12.222 --> 32:14.141
because if they ever find out
what's been going on...

32:14.224 --> 32:15.643
I better
talk this over with Otto.

32:15.726 --> 32:16.685
Oh, no, you don't!

32:16.727 --> 32:17.853
You're not gonna
see him again...

32:17.895 --> 32:19.563
and you're not going
back to East Berlin.

32:19.647 --> 32:21.774
Oh. He's right downstairs.

32:23.317 --> 32:24.443
Otto!

32:26.445 --> 32:28.739
Otto, darling!

32:29.782 --> 32:31.408
Up here.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.412
Come on up, Liebchen.

32:40.084 --> 32:41.377
Liebchen?

32:41.418 --> 32:43.379
I don't want that creep
in my office.

32:43.420 --> 32:45.673
Why don't you send him home
to clean out his cage?

32:45.756 --> 32:46.674
I think he better be here...

32:46.757 --> 32:49.051
because we have
something to tell you.

32:49.093 --> 32:50.719
Tell me what?

32:50.761 --> 32:52.054
You're not engaged again,
are you?

32:52.096 --> 32:53.347
No, not this time.

32:53.430 --> 32:54.723
- Thank God.
- We're married.

32:54.765 --> 32:56.100
For a minute there,
I was afraid...

32:57.518 --> 32:58.477
You're married?

32:58.519 --> 33:00.854
Uh-huh.
It will be six weeks on Monday.

33:00.896 --> 33:02.231
You married a Communist?

33:02.314 --> 33:04.149
He's not a Communist.
He's a republican.

33:04.233 --> 33:06.735
He comes from
the Republic of East Germany.

33:06.819 --> 33:09.947
Why, you dumb,
stupid little pot!

33:10.030 --> 33:11.907
Do you realize what you've done?

33:11.991 --> 33:13.575
You've ruined me, that's all.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.077
What are your parents
going to say?

33:15.160 --> 33:16.745
They trusted me,
and I trusted you.

33:16.787 --> 33:19.540
Then you go and pull
an idiotic stunt like this.

33:19.581 --> 33:21.959
Why didn't you
look after me better?

33:22.084 --> 33:24.878
Fifteen years with the company
down the drain.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.547
I'll be blacklisted.

33:26.588 --> 33:27.756
My kids will starve.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.466
My wife will be selling pencils!

33:29.550 --> 33:31.719
And all on account
of you and your hot blood.

33:33.762 --> 33:36.390
Come in. Come in, Otto.

33:41.645 --> 33:43.856
This is Mr. MacNamara.

33:43.897 --> 33:46.734
My husband...
Otto Ludwig Piffl.

33:46.775 --> 33:49.653
Piffl? Wouldn't you know.

33:53.907 --> 33:55.159
Where did you dig him up?

33:55.242 --> 33:57.244
He doesn't even wear socks.

33:57.286 --> 33:59.371
He doesn't wear shorts, either.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.082
Isn't that exciting?

34:04.251 --> 34:05.711
Take your cap off.

34:05.753 --> 34:06.712
Why?

34:06.754 --> 34:08.714
Because I said so.

34:10.257 --> 34:12.760
In Lenin's tomb,
I take my cap off.

34:12.842 --> 34:14.594
If Van Cliburn
plays Tchaikovsky...

34:14.636 --> 34:16.096
I take my cap off...

34:16.179 --> 34:19.975
but in Coca-Cola office, phooey!

34:20.059 --> 34:22.436
Do it for me,
Otto, darling.

34:22.518 --> 34:24.103
For you, I do it.

34:24.188 --> 34:25.813
He could use a haircut...

34:25.898 --> 34:27.190
and I'd like
to give it to him myself...

34:27.232 --> 34:28.900
with a hammer and sickle.

34:28.942 --> 34:29.902
Warmonger.

34:29.943 --> 34:30.902
Shut up, you punk.

34:30.944 --> 34:32.487
Don't you talk like that
to my husband.

34:32.571 --> 34:33.572
He's not your husband!

34:33.614 --> 34:35.449
In the first place,
she's underage.

34:35.532 --> 34:38.077
Next, we don't recognize
the government of East Germany.

34:38.118 --> 34:40.579
Next, she admits that while she
was washing your shirts...

34:40.661 --> 34:42.246
you were washing her brain!

34:42.289 --> 34:43.998
So the whole thing is illegal.

34:44.041 --> 34:46.042
No, it's not.
I have a certificate.

34:46.043 --> 34:48.712
And tell him
about the wedding rings.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.797
Forged from the steel
of a brave cannon...

34:50.880 --> 34:53.175
that fought at Stalingrad.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.592
I don't care
who your jeweler is!

34:54.635 --> 34:56.011
The marriage is illegal.

34:56.053 --> 34:57.596
You say, but in the eyes...

34:57.638 --> 34:59.306
of the People's Republic
of East Germany...

34:59.389 --> 35:00.599
we are husband and wife.

35:00.641 --> 35:02.059
You are not in East Germany now.

35:02.184 --> 35:04.186
You are in West Berlin,
and I can have you arrested...

35:04.269 --> 35:06.396
for lying on rooftops
with a minor.

35:06.438 --> 35:09.066
Of course you can.
I know your tactics.

35:09.149 --> 35:11.068
You can have me arrested.
You can have tortured.

35:11.110 --> 35:14.071
You can have me shot like you've
been doing in the Congo!

35:14.113 --> 35:16.115
Africa for the Africans!

35:16.782 --> 35:18.158
All I want from you,
Scarlett Piffl...

35:18.242 --> 35:20.327
is silence
and damn little of that.

35:20.410 --> 35:22.454
Don't you talk like that
to my wife!

35:23.539 --> 35:25.374
Who? Brinkley?

35:25.415 --> 35:27.793
Well, tell him I already
gave the message to Huntley.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.755
Look, Otto baby.

35:31.839 --> 35:33.799
If we're to live together
in peaceful coexistence...

35:33.882 --> 35:35.926
there must be a certain amount
of give-and-take.

35:35.968 --> 35:37.594
How'd you like a thousand marks?

35:37.636 --> 35:38.846
For what?

35:38.929 --> 35:40.848
Just get on your motorcycle,
go back where you came from...

35:40.931 --> 35:41.890
and forget
about the whole thing.

35:41.932 --> 35:43.642
You can't bribe him.

35:43.725 --> 35:44.685
Two thousand?

35:44.768 --> 35:45.686
How about five thousand?

35:45.727 --> 35:46.854
Otto, what are you saying?

35:46.895 --> 35:48.188
OK. Five thousand marks.

35:48.230 --> 35:50.566
If it's worth five thousand,
why not fifty thousand?

35:50.607 --> 35:52.609
Fifty thousand? You crazy?

35:53.277 --> 35:54.736
I just want to see
how far they will go...

35:54.820 --> 35:57.739
to break up a happy
Socialist marriage.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.575
I spit on your money.

35:59.616 --> 36:01.076
I spit on Fort Knox!

36:01.118 --> 36:03.245
I spit on Wall Street!

36:03.328 --> 36:05.205
Unsanitary little jerk,
isn't he?

36:05.247 --> 36:07.291
You and your kind are doomed.

36:07.374 --> 36:08.625
We will take over West Berlin.

36:08.709 --> 36:10.127
We will take over
Western Europe.

36:10.210 --> 36:11.420
We will bury you!

36:11.461 --> 36:12.588
Do me a favor, will you?

36:12.671 --> 36:14.423
Bury us, but don't marry us.

36:14.464 --> 36:17.926
Look at all this waste.

36:18.635 --> 36:22.306
Capitalism is like
a dead herring in the moonlight.

36:22.389 --> 36:24.725
It shines, but it stinks!

36:24.766 --> 36:27.603
He talks like that all the time.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.813
Tell him about
Coca-Cola colonialism.

36:29.897 --> 36:30.814
What?

36:30.898 --> 36:32.232
As chairman Khrushchev said...

36:32.316 --> 36:34.443
on the 40th anniversary
of the revolution...

36:34.526 --> 36:37.779
To hell with the revolution
and to hell with Khrushchev!

36:39.489 --> 36:41.867
The hell with Frank Sinatra.

36:42.409 --> 36:44.244
Oh, it's gonna be
a real clambake...

36:44.286 --> 36:45.662
when your folks
get here tomorrow.

36:45.746 --> 36:47.915
How are we gonna explain this?

36:47.956 --> 36:51.001
That's your problem
because I won't be here.

36:51.084 --> 36:52.628
What do you mean,
you won't be here?

36:52.711 --> 36:55.589
Tonight, my wife and I
are leaving for Moscow.

36:55.631 --> 36:57.424
Moscow?

36:57.466 --> 36:59.092
That's what I came to tell you.

36:59.134 --> 37:00.260
He's got a scholarship...

37:00.344 --> 37:02.763
to the People's
Technological Institute.

37:02.846 --> 37:05.057
He's studying to be
a missile engineer.

37:05.098 --> 37:06.725
Soviet missiles...

37:07.935 --> 37:09.728
Venus!

37:09.770 --> 37:11.104
American missiles...

37:12.022 --> 37:14.066
Miami beach.

37:16.443 --> 37:20.739
So you just tell Daddy
I'm on my way to the U.S.S.R.

37:20.822 --> 37:22.991
That's short for Russia.

37:25.369 --> 37:28.080
Are you out of your
seventeen-year-old mind?

37:28.121 --> 37:29.581
Russia's to get out of,
not to get into.

37:29.665 --> 37:31.124
Where Otto goes, I go!

37:31.208 --> 37:33.085
You just try to stop us.

37:33.168 --> 37:34.586
Can you talk to your wife?

37:34.670 --> 37:36.713
Well, I certainly
can't talk to them.

37:36.755 --> 37:37.923
On this phone.

37:40.217 --> 37:41.760
Hello? Yes, dear.

37:41.843 --> 37:43.219
Mac, hold everything.

37:43.220 --> 37:44.846
I bet I know
what happened to Scarlett.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.432
Lucky Pierre
must be back in town.

37:47.516 --> 37:50.852
It's not Lucky Pierre.
It's Crazy Otto.

37:50.894 --> 37:51.895
Are you ready for this?

37:51.979 --> 37:54.398
She's married. That's right.

37:54.439 --> 37:56.358
She got herself an ever-loving,
curly-haired...

37:56.400 --> 37:58.235
card-carrying husband.

37:59.403 --> 38:01.697
She married a Communist?

38:02.197 --> 38:04.658
This is gonna be the biggest
thing to hit Atlanta...

38:04.741 --> 38:07.411
since General Sherman
threw that little barbecue.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.705
No, I don't think it's funny.

38:10.247 --> 38:13.750
They're gonna live in Moscow?
Now, that's funny.

38:13.834 --> 38:16.252
Yeah, hysterical,
but what can I do...

38:16.253 --> 38:17.879
go fight the Kremlin?

38:17.921 --> 38:19.131
I can't stop them.

38:19.214 --> 38:20.716
They're young,
they're in love...

38:20.757 --> 38:23.218
and we're a dead herring
in the moonlight...

38:23.260 --> 38:26.972
so who am I to stand in the way
of a happy Socialist marriage?

38:27.055 --> 38:28.974
Oh, come off it, Mac.
I know you.

38:29.057 --> 38:31.018
You've got something
up your sleeve.

38:31.101 --> 38:34.187
I wouldn't be surprised. Bye.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.274
Now, what time
are you kids leaving?

38:37.357 --> 38:39.776
7:00 on the Moscow Express.

38:39.860 --> 38:40.777
Why do you want to know?

38:40.861 --> 38:42.779
Because I'm gonna
dynamite the train.

38:42.863 --> 38:44.656
What makes you guys
so suspicious?

38:44.740 --> 38:47.909
I better get back to the house
and start packing.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.746
You think I ought to take
both my mink coats?

38:50.829 --> 38:53.373
Darling, no woman
should have two mink coats...

38:53.415 --> 38:55.917
until every woman in the world
has one mink coat.

38:56.001 --> 38:56.960
Why don't you
cut the other one up...

38:57.044 --> 38:58.211
and make him a pair of shorts?

38:58.253 --> 39:00.088
I hear it's freezing there
all the time.

39:00.130 --> 39:01.256
Thirty below zero.

39:01.298 --> 39:02.632
Fascist lies!

39:02.716 --> 39:04.551
You better go home
and pack, too, darling.

39:04.593 --> 39:05.927
It will take me no time...

39:05.969 --> 39:09.097
Just my chessboard, my extra
shirt, and two hundred books.

39:09.181 --> 39:11.433
Well, as long as Smiley here
is going back to East Berlin...

39:11.516 --> 39:12.684
I'll get the car for you.

39:12.768 --> 39:14.144
Schlemmer, will you
run downstairs...

39:14.227 --> 39:16.730
and tell Fritz he'll have
to take Scarlett home?

39:17.439 --> 39:18.732
You're letting her go to Moscow?

39:18.815 --> 39:19.983
In a pig's eye.

39:20.067 --> 39:22.402
Now, look.
His motorcycle's downstairs.

39:22.444 --> 39:24.738
Remember that idea
you had about the balloon?

39:26.948 --> 39:28.033
Just think, Liebchen...

39:28.075 --> 39:30.827
tomorrow night, we'll be
strolling hand in hand...

39:30.911 --> 39:32.537
across Red Square.

39:32.579 --> 39:33.580
I hope you won't be
ashamed of me...

39:33.622 --> 39:35.165
in front of your friends.

39:35.248 --> 39:36.333
Of course not.

39:36.416 --> 39:39.127
I promise you, I'll only wear
my jewelry at home.

39:39.211 --> 39:41.755
They have assigned us
a magnificent apartment...

39:41.797 --> 39:43.632
just a short walk
from the bathroom.

39:43.715 --> 39:44.758
I love you.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.426
I'll make you very happy.

39:46.468 --> 39:48.553
Every morning, we'll have
breakfast in bed.

39:48.595 --> 39:49.888
Sounds wonderful.

39:49.930 --> 39:51.598
Also lunch, also dinner.

39:51.640 --> 39:52.849
In bed?

39:52.933 --> 39:54.351
There's no table and no chairs.

39:54.434 --> 39:55.727
Who cares?

39:59.064 --> 40:00.899
I'll pick you at 6:30 sharp...

40:00.982 --> 40:03.443
because the 7:00 train to Moscow
leaves promptly at 8:15.

40:03.527 --> 40:04.444
Wait a minute, kids.

40:04.528 --> 40:06.446
Before you go, I'd like
to give you a little present.

40:06.530 --> 40:07.572
Why?

40:07.614 --> 40:08.615
It's customary when
two people get married.

40:08.698 --> 40:11.618
Otto's friends
didn't give us any presents.

40:11.701 --> 40:12.911
Instead, they sent the money...

40:12.994 --> 40:15.497
to the unemployed
cotton pickers in Mississippi.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.290
Oh. How about a cocktail shaker?

40:17.374 --> 40:19.084
No. I guess not.

40:19.126 --> 40:20.293
I know.

40:21.503 --> 40:22.754
A cuckoo clock.

40:23.755 --> 40:26.883
Handmade by dwarfs
in the Black Forest.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.927
So now they're
exploiting dwarfs.

40:29.010 --> 40:31.763
I'm sorry I haven't got
any fancy wrapping paper.

40:31.805 --> 40:33.890
We do not want
anything from you.

40:35.308 --> 40:36.268
Otto, don't be rude.

40:36.351 --> 40:38.687
I think it's very sweet
of Mr. MacNamara.

40:38.728 --> 40:41.398
Now we'll have
a bed and a clock.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.233
We will get
our own clock in Russia.

40:43.275 --> 40:45.777
If your clocks don't run
any better than your trains...

40:45.861 --> 40:47.571
you might as well take this one.

40:47.612 --> 40:50.031
You laugh at us now,
but not for long...

40:50.073 --> 40:53.577
because you're arrogant
and fat and bloated.

40:53.618 --> 40:56.288
The worms will have a picnic.

40:56.371 --> 40:58.290
See you on the barricades, pal.

41:00.250 --> 41:02.627
When the day comes,
I'll put in a good word for you.

41:02.711 --> 41:03.753
Scarlett!

41:03.837 --> 41:05.505
It's my parents
I feel sorry for.

41:05.589 --> 41:07.215
It's too late to save them.

41:07.257 --> 41:09.676
Otto says
they'll have to be liquidated.

41:09.759 --> 41:11.136
Bye!

41:21.980 --> 41:23.815
Schlemmer!

41:23.899 --> 41:25.942
Hurry up!

41:37.329 --> 41:38.788
Wiedersehen, Liebchen.

41:38.872 --> 41:40.457
Auf Wiedersehen.

42:17.661 --> 42:19.579
Good boy, Schlemmer.

42:19.621 --> 42:20.580
Yes, sir.

42:20.622 --> 42:22.082
Anything else you wish me to do?

42:22.165 --> 42:23.083
No, thanks.

42:23.166 --> 42:24.251
We can just sit back now...

42:24.292 --> 42:26.628
and let the East German
police finish the job.

42:26.711 --> 42:27.629
Pardon me.

42:27.712 --> 42:30.382
I must be very stupid, but I
do not understand any of this.

42:30.423 --> 42:31.508
There's nothing to it.

42:31.591 --> 42:33.426
All it takes is a little
knowledge of physics...

42:33.468 --> 42:35.345
and elementary psychology.

42:35.428 --> 42:38.682
Right now,
Comrade Otto Ludwig Piffl...

42:38.765 --> 42:40.141
is tooling along
on his motorcycle...

42:40.225 --> 42:43.603
toward East Berlin,
gay, chipper...

42:43.687 --> 42:46.106
feeling like a million rubles.

42:46.189 --> 42:49.150
Little does he know that
meanwhile back at the exhaust...

42:49.234 --> 42:51.945
the fumes
are filling the balloon.

42:52.028 --> 42:54.823
It gets bigger and bigger...

42:54.906 --> 42:57.284
and all the time
in the sidecar...

42:57.367 --> 43:00.328
a little booby trap
is ticking away.

43:00.412 --> 43:02.914
Now, if my calculations
are correct...

43:02.956 --> 43:05.083
all these things
will begin to pay off...

43:05.125 --> 43:08.336
once he passes through
the Brandenburg Gate.

45:07.706 --> 45:11.084
You can forward my mail care of
American Express in Moscow.

45:11.126 --> 45:13.420
And "Vogue" magazine
and "Screen Romances."

45:13.461 --> 45:16.214
All right, If you promise
to send me "Pravda" every day...

45:16.256 --> 45:17.424
just the funnies.

45:17.507 --> 45:18.925
He should be here by now.

45:19.008 --> 45:20.510
What time is it?

45:20.593 --> 45:22.804
6:25. Relax.

45:23.972 --> 45:25.515
Danke schön, Danke schön.

45:25.598 --> 45:26.516
Don't mention it.

45:26.599 --> 45:28.810
Are you sure you want
to leave her that coat?

45:28.893 --> 45:29.769
Oh, yes.

45:29.853 --> 45:31.646
Otto thinks every woman
should have a mink.

45:31.730 --> 45:33.231
I'm with Otto.

45:33.314 --> 45:36.067
Well, maybe she'll let me
borrow it on my night out.

45:37.569 --> 45:41.197
Do you realize that
Otto spelled backwards is Otto?

45:41.239 --> 45:42.323
How about that?

45:42.407 --> 45:43.408
You'll like him.

45:43.491 --> 45:46.411
He looks just like Jack Kennedy,
only he's younger...

45:46.494 --> 45:48.413
and he has more upstairs.

45:48.496 --> 45:49.414
More brains?

45:49.497 --> 45:50.707
More hair.

45:50.832 --> 45:53.710
And of course, ideologically,
he's much sounder.

45:53.835 --> 45:55.587
Maybe we voted
for the wrong man.

45:55.670 --> 45:57.172
That couldn't happen in Russia.

45:57.255 --> 45:58.214
They don't make mistakes?

45:58.256 --> 45:59.632
They don't vote.

46:01.551 --> 46:04.929
Have you ever made love
to a revolutionary?

46:05.013 --> 46:08.641
No, but I once necked
with a Stevenson Democrat.

46:08.725 --> 46:11.978
We'll, I've been engaged four
times, so I know about men...

46:12.061 --> 46:14.397
and those subversives,
they're the wildest!

46:14.481 --> 46:15.690
- Really?
- No contest.

46:15.732 --> 46:18.568
And I just thought we were
lagging behind in missiles.

46:25.366 --> 46:27.452
Hiya, girls. Wie gehts?
Was ist cooking?

46:27.535 --> 46:29.329
Bertha, you better
take Miss Hazeltine's luggage...

46:29.412 --> 46:30.997
back upstairs.

46:32.832 --> 46:34.542
Back upstairs? She's leaving.

46:34.584 --> 46:35.627
I wouldn't count on it.

46:35.710 --> 46:37.086
Bourbon and soda, anyone?

46:37.754 --> 46:39.506
What's he talking about?

46:39.589 --> 46:41.341
Otto's coming
to pick me up any minute.

46:41.424 --> 46:42.383
Oh, no, he's not.

46:42.425 --> 46:44.969
Otto's been picked up himself
by the East German police.

46:45.053 --> 46:46.513
Police? What for?

46:46.596 --> 46:47.514
Who knows?

46:47.597 --> 46:48.515
Over there,
they toss people in jail...

46:48.598 --> 46:50.141
like we throw away used Kleenex.

46:50.225 --> 46:51.142
In jail?

46:51.226 --> 46:52.435
How do you know?

46:52.519 --> 46:53.561
Bad news travels fast.

46:53.603 --> 46:54.562
Say when.

46:54.604 --> 46:56.272
Where is he? I must go to him.

46:56.356 --> 46:57.273
That's the worst thing
you can do.

46:57.357 --> 46:58.650
He's in trouble enough already.

46:58.733 --> 47:00.777
But he's my husband.
I want to help him.

47:00.860 --> 47:01.778
We all do.

47:01.861 --> 47:02.779
That's why we have
to get the marriage...

47:02.862 --> 47:03.780
annulled right away.

47:03.863 --> 47:05.156
Annulled?
Now wait a minute, Mac.

47:05.240 --> 47:06.157
Look.

47:06.241 --> 47:08.827
If on top of everything else,
they find out he's married...

47:08.910 --> 47:11.371
to the parasite daughter
of an American capitalist...

47:11.412 --> 47:13.122
they'll send him up
for twenty years...

47:13.206 --> 47:16.751
slaving away in the salt mines,
schlepping those heavy bags...

47:16.793 --> 47:19.712
barefoot through the snow
with nothing to keep him warm...

47:19.754 --> 47:21.881
but the hot breath
of the Cossacks.

47:21.923 --> 47:23.174
Otto!

47:25.426 --> 47:26.970
Nice work, Mac.

47:27.512 --> 47:29.472
Scarlett. Scarlett!

47:30.807 --> 47:32.433
Try some ice.

47:32.475 --> 47:34.894
Bertha, call Dr. Bauer,
will you?

47:35.895 --> 47:37.981
I will call the doctor...

47:38.064 --> 47:41.234
but I will not give back
the mink coat.

47:48.241 --> 47:51.286
The temperature, she is normal.

47:52.620 --> 47:54.163
Der pulse...

47:55.415 --> 47:56.374
What's the matter, doctor?

47:56.416 --> 47:59.419
I have missed the first act
of "The Valkyrie."

47:59.502 --> 48:02.005
Der pulse is normal.

48:07.927 --> 48:10.597
Das ist definitely nicht
normal.

48:11.472 --> 48:13.057
I'll fix that.

48:17.103 --> 48:19.063
Cut it out, kids.

48:19.147 --> 48:20.315
Scarlett is sick.

48:20.398 --> 48:22.567
If she dies,
can I have my room back?

48:26.029 --> 48:27.739
How would I know?
I'm not a lawyer.

48:27.780 --> 48:29.032
That's your job.

48:30.116 --> 48:32.118
What am I paying you for?

48:32.201 --> 48:34.913
You must have
some contacts in East Berlin.

48:34.954 --> 48:37.415
No! I don't want
the marriage just annulled.

48:37.457 --> 48:39.208
I want it wiped off the books.

48:39.250 --> 48:40.668
I don't care how you do it.

48:40.752 --> 48:42.503
Bribe one of the clerks
over there.

48:42.587 --> 48:43.671
Destroy the file.

48:43.755 --> 48:45.840
Look. If you guys could
burn down the Reichstag...

48:45.924 --> 48:48.301
you can set a match to one
measly marriage certificate...

48:48.384 --> 48:50.094
and it has to be done tonight!

48:51.512 --> 48:52.639
Cheers.

48:52.722 --> 48:54.515
Feeling pretty good,
aren't you, mein Führer?

48:54.599 --> 48:55.516
Not bad.

48:55.600 --> 48:56.976
You framed that poor boy.

48:57.060 --> 48:58.186
You bet I did.

48:58.227 --> 48:59.562
I'm not gonna let
that Communist kook...

48:59.604 --> 49:00.563
ruin somebody's life.

49:00.647 --> 49:01.731
But she loves him.

49:01.773 --> 49:03.232
Not her life, mine!

49:03.316 --> 49:05.735
I'm all set for the London job.
You want me to blow it?

49:05.818 --> 49:06.736
I couldn't care less.

49:06.819 --> 49:08.404
I'm fed up
with this whole deal...

49:08.446 --> 49:09.739
Hopping all around the map...

49:09.781 --> 49:11.532
from Baghdad to Caracas
to Cape Town...

49:11.574 --> 49:13.117
dragging our young behind us.

49:13.201 --> 49:14.118
Who needs it?

49:14.202 --> 49:15.119
What would you suggest?

49:15.203 --> 49:17.664
Well, why can't you get yourself
a nice, permanent job...

49:17.747 --> 49:19.248
with the home office
in Atlanta?

49:19.332 --> 49:21.334
Atlanta? You can't be serious.

49:21.417 --> 49:23.211
That's Siberia with mint juleps!

49:23.252 --> 49:25.004
Mac, I've had it.
I want to go home.

49:25.088 --> 49:26.005
Give me one good reason.

49:26.089 --> 49:27.090
All right.

49:27.173 --> 49:28.800
Cindy has to have
her teeth straightened.

49:28.883 --> 49:29.926
Tommy is ten years old.

49:30.051 --> 49:32.261
He's never had
a peanut butter sandwich.

49:32.303 --> 49:33.888
And for a change,
I'd like to see "Gunsmoke"...

49:33.930 --> 49:36.224
not in German
or Portuguese or Swahili!

49:36.265 --> 49:37.892
You want to go home
and pay taxes?

49:37.934 --> 49:40.311
We've got it made...
Big house, servants...

49:40.395 --> 49:42.230
limousine,
fat expense account...

49:42.313 --> 49:43.231
and you want to give
all that up...

49:43.314 --> 49:44.565
for a peanut butter
sandwich?

49:44.607 --> 49:45.733
Oh, it's a great life for you.

49:45.817 --> 49:47.318
Everywhere we go,
you find yourself...

49:47.402 --> 49:48.444
some friendly secretary...

49:48.528 --> 49:50.405
who gives language lessons
on the side.

49:50.446 --> 49:51.489
What does that mean?

49:51.572 --> 49:53.157
I can always tell
when you've got a new teacher.

49:53.241 --> 49:55.743
You start wearing your
elevator shoes to the office.

49:55.785 --> 49:56.744
Phyllis, are you implying...

49:56.828 --> 49:57.912
I've known it for years.

49:57.954 --> 49:59.539
And you never said
anything to me about it?

49:59.580 --> 50:00.581
That's not fair!

50:00.623 --> 50:03.501
I just didn't want to be one of
those nagging American wives...

50:03.584 --> 50:04.752
but maybe I was wrong.

50:04.836 --> 50:07.088
Maybe we should have had it out
a long time ago.

50:11.968 --> 50:12.969
How is she, doctor?

50:13.052 --> 50:14.262
Perfectly normal.

50:14.345 --> 50:16.681
She keeps asking
for somebody named Otto.

50:16.764 --> 50:18.099
Otto? Never heard of him.

50:18.141 --> 50:19.558
But she's going to be all right.

50:19.559 --> 50:20.893
Hundert prozent.

50:20.977 --> 50:23.855
You will be happy to know
that the young lady is...

50:23.896 --> 50:26.399
How do you say it in English?
Schwanger?

50:26.482 --> 50:27.400
Schwanger?

50:27.483 --> 50:28.401
What's that?

50:28.484 --> 50:29.402
You're the one
who's studying German.

50:29.485 --> 50:31.070
Schwanger. You know.

50:31.154 --> 50:33.948
Such a dummkopf I am!
Schwanger.

50:34.032 --> 50:35.742
Schwanger, schwanger.

50:35.783 --> 50:36.909
I know what it means.

50:38.244 --> 50:39.203
What?

50:39.245 --> 50:41.164
You told me
not to use words like that.

50:41.247 --> 50:42.582
Come on!

50:42.665 --> 50:44.167
You want me to tell you?

50:44.250 --> 50:45.209
Please!

50:45.251 --> 50:47.545
Scarlett's gonna have puppies.

50:49.005 --> 50:49.964
What?

50:50.006 --> 50:50.965
She's pregnant?

50:51.007 --> 50:53.593
That is the word. Pregnant!

50:53.634 --> 50:54.594
Auf Wiedersehen.

50:54.635 --> 50:56.220
Schwanger is pregnant.

50:56.262 --> 50:58.306
Pregnant is schwanger.

51:02.727 --> 51:05.855
Mother of mercy.
Is this the end of Little Rico?

51:06.481 --> 51:07.982
All right, children,
back to your room.

51:08.066 --> 51:09.525
Get ready for bed.

51:12.695 --> 51:14.739
I wonder what it's like
to work for Pepsi Cola.

51:14.822 --> 51:15.990
Please, Phyllis.

51:16.074 --> 51:17.867
So tomorrow,
Mr. and Mrs. Hazeltine...

51:17.909 --> 51:19.535
will arrive at the airport...

51:19.577 --> 51:21.245
and there will be
little Scarlett...

51:21.329 --> 51:25.416
unchanged, unspoiled, unwed,
just slightly schwanger.

51:25.500 --> 51:26.417
Cheers.

51:26.501 --> 51:28.336
Phyllis, I'm trying to think!

51:28.419 --> 51:29.712
Think fast, Mr. Moto...

51:29.754 --> 51:31.589
because there will be
a few questions asked...

51:31.672 --> 51:33.382
like, for instance,
who's the father?

51:33.424 --> 51:35.218
I'll have the answers
when the time comes.

51:35.259 --> 51:37.345
You better have Otto
when the time comes.

51:37.428 --> 51:40.723
Otto? That would be disaster!

51:40.765 --> 51:42.558
Let me see.

51:42.600 --> 51:44.811
She was secretly married...

51:44.894 --> 51:47.105
to somebody
in the American embassy.

51:47.188 --> 51:48.356
They were honeymooning
in the Alps...

51:48.397 --> 51:50.399
and he was killed
by an avalanche.

51:50.483 --> 51:52.902
Nah! That's no good.

51:52.985 --> 51:55.613
He was sent on a secret mission
behind the Iron Curtain...

51:55.696 --> 51:56.948
never heard from again!

51:57.031 --> 51:58.950
As a matter of fact,
the whole thing was so secret...

51:59.033 --> 52:00.576
we can't even mention his name.

52:00.660 --> 52:02.453
Now you're really running amuck.

52:02.537 --> 52:04.247
You think Scarlett
is going to stand still for...

52:04.330 --> 52:06.916
Better a dead hero
than a live Communist.

52:06.999 --> 52:07.917
First thing in the morning...

52:08.000 --> 52:09.502
I'll pick up
a distinguished service medal.

52:09.585 --> 52:12.255
It was awarded to him
posthumously.

52:12.296 --> 52:15.299
And while you're at it,
pin one on yourself...

52:15.383 --> 52:18.636
First-class heel
with oak leaf cluster.

52:18.719 --> 52:20.388
Well, what do you want me to do?

52:20.429 --> 52:22.265
I had enough trouble
getting the guy into jail.

52:22.348 --> 52:24.600
It's gonna be ten times
as tough to get him out!

52:37.780 --> 52:38.865
Schlemmer!

52:38.906 --> 52:40.533
Don't click your heels.

52:40.575 --> 52:42.160
Schlemmer, I'm gonna
need you tonight.

52:42.243 --> 52:43.369
I'll pick you up
in front of your house...

52:43.411 --> 52:44.579
in exactly ten minutes.

52:44.620 --> 52:45.746
Meanwhile, call Ingeborg.

52:45.788 --> 52:46.747
Tell her it's an emergency.

52:46.831 --> 52:48.499
We'll pick her up
in exactly twelve minutes.

52:48.583 --> 52:49.876
Over and out!

53:13.274 --> 53:14.233
Wo fahren Sie hin?

53:14.275 --> 53:15.234
Ost Berlin.

53:15.276 --> 53:16.527
- Papiere.
- American citizen.

53:16.569 --> 53:17.737
What is purpose of your visit?

53:17.820 --> 53:19.405
I'm going to see
Commissar Peripetchikoff...

53:19.488 --> 53:20.907
chairman of
the Russian Trade Commission.

53:20.990 --> 53:21.991
- What for?
- On business.

53:22.074 --> 53:23.409
I represent Coca-Cola.

53:23.492 --> 53:25.703
Coca-Cola? You have proof?

53:25.745 --> 53:27.121
Will this do?

53:29.207 --> 53:30.291
I confiscate proof.

53:30.374 --> 53:31.792
Fair enough.
Just return the empties.

53:31.876 --> 53:33.252
OK. Proceed.

53:44.305 --> 53:47.141
If I may say so,
this whole idea is crazy.

53:47.308 --> 53:49.143
It will not work.
I can feel it.

53:49.310 --> 53:50.311
And I'm scared.

53:50.353 --> 53:51.395
Pull yourself
together, Schlemmer.

53:51.479 --> 53:52.480
- That's an order.
- Yes, sir.

53:53.189 --> 53:56.108
I'm scared, also.
Not for myself.

53:56.192 --> 53:58.736
I only worry something
will happen to my new dress.

53:58.819 --> 54:01.072
I'll buy you
a half a dozen dresses.

54:01.155 --> 54:02.531
They're staying at
the Grand Hotel Potemkin.

54:02.573 --> 54:03.532
Do you know where that is?

54:03.574 --> 54:05.868
Yes, sir. It used to be
the Great Hotel Göring...

54:05.910 --> 54:08.287
and before that,
it was the Great Hotel Bismarck.

55:19.734 --> 55:20.901
Hey!

55:21.861 --> 55:23.487
Gospodin MacNamara.

55:23.529 --> 55:26.365
If it isn't my old friend
Hart, Schaffner, and Karl Marx.

55:26.407 --> 55:28.242
I see you bring
blond lady with you.

55:28.326 --> 55:29.618
Ring a ding ding.

55:29.702 --> 55:31.954
Sit down!
Sit down, my friends.

55:32.038 --> 55:33.706
- Join us.
- Right here, Fräulein.

55:33.789 --> 55:35.708
I said Karl Marx, not Groucho.

55:35.750 --> 55:37.877
To what do we owe
this unexpected pleasure?

55:37.960 --> 55:39.920
Well, you're a trade commission.
I thought we might trade.

55:40.004 --> 55:40.921
Coca-Cola?

55:41.005 --> 55:42.089
No, but I hear
you boys would like...

55:42.173 --> 55:43.758
Fräulein Ingeborg
to go to work for you.

55:43.841 --> 55:44.925
You want to trade
your secretary?

55:45.009 --> 55:46.385
- Right.
- For Russian secretary?

55:46.427 --> 55:47.762
- Wrong.
- I do not blame you.

55:47.845 --> 55:50.264
Ours is built like
bowlegged samovar.

55:55.519 --> 55:57.521
We find proposition
very interesting.

55:57.605 --> 55:58.856
Now, what can we offer you?

55:58.939 --> 56:00.858
Actually, all I want from you
is a small favor.

56:00.900 --> 56:02.693
Small favor,
big favor... anything.

56:02.777 --> 56:04.070
There's a guy named
Otto Ludwig Piffl.

56:04.153 --> 56:05.696
He's being held
by the East German police.

56:05.780 --> 56:06.864
For what reason?

56:06.947 --> 56:08.366
Son of a gun
stole my cuckoo clock.

56:08.449 --> 56:10.826
- You want cuckoo clock back?
- Wrong.

56:10.868 --> 56:12.036
- You want Piffl back?
- Right.

56:12.119 --> 56:13.287
Impossible, my friend.

56:13.371 --> 56:14.914
We cannot interfere
with internal affairs...

56:14.997 --> 56:16.957
of Sovereign Republic
of East Germany.

56:17.041 --> 56:19.001
No Piffl, no deal.
Let's go, Ingeborg.

56:19.043 --> 56:22.004
Wait! What is the hurry?
You're not giving us a chance.

56:22.046 --> 56:23.381
Is old Russian proverb

56:23.464 --> 56:25.841
You cannot milk cow
with hands in pockets.

56:25.883 --> 56:29.595
Herr Robert! Vodka! Caviar!

56:29.678 --> 56:31.346
Herr Kapellmeister!

56:31.347 --> 56:33.557
More rock'n'roll!

56:53.202 --> 56:54.370
Hey!

57:06.382 --> 57:08.217
You like this caviar?

57:08.300 --> 57:10.219
We give you a hundred pounds.

57:10.261 --> 57:11.804
I want Piffl.

57:43.919 --> 57:46.005
Would you take new automobile?

57:46.046 --> 57:49.884
1961 Moskvich hardtop
convertible... two-toned.

57:49.925 --> 57:52.261
You mean that Russian hot rod
parked outside?

57:52.344 --> 57:56.265
Is wonderful car.
Is exact copy of 1937 Nash.

57:56.348 --> 57:57.725
Not interested.

58:40.643 --> 58:42.645
We will give you
Chinese cigarettes...

58:42.686 --> 58:44.438
Armenian rugs...

58:44.522 --> 58:45.814
Bulgarian yogurt?

58:45.856 --> 58:47.233
Piffl or nothing.

58:48.734 --> 58:49.693
I know what.

58:49.735 --> 58:53.197
We have warehouse full of Spam
left over from lend-lease.

58:53.280 --> 58:55.199
It's 5:00, and we're
getting nowhere.

58:55.241 --> 58:57.535
Ingeborg, put your shoes on.

58:57.618 --> 59:00.704
One more minute, please.
Summit conference!

59:05.584 --> 59:08.128
Before we make deal,
we want right of inspection.

59:08.963 --> 59:09.880
I veto it.

59:09.964 --> 59:11.715
I thought so.

59:11.799 --> 59:13.676
Well, comrades,
what are we going to do?

59:13.717 --> 59:15.135
He's got it, we want it.

59:15.219 --> 59:16.220
Are we going to accept...

59:16.262 --> 59:18.180
his blackmailing
capitalistic deal?

59:18.222 --> 59:19.682
- Let us take a vote.
- I vote yes.

59:20.266 --> 59:21.725
Two out of three.
Deal is on.

59:21.767 --> 59:23.102
Comrades, before
we get in trouble...

59:23.185 --> 59:24.520
I must warn you...

59:24.562 --> 59:26.564
I'm not really from
Soft Drink Secretariat.

59:26.647 --> 59:29.316
I'm undercover agent
assigned to watch you.

59:29.358 --> 59:31.527
In that case, I vote no.
Deal is off.

59:31.569 --> 59:32.820
But I vote yes.

59:32.861 --> 59:35.322
Two out of three again!
Deal is on.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.560
OK, kids, strip for action.

01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:08.522
It was
an itsy-bitsy teeny-weeny.

01:00:08.606 --> 01:00:09.898
Yellow polka dot bikini.

01:00:09.982 --> 01:00:11.066
Nein.

01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:13.819
That she wore
for the first time today.

01:00:13.861 --> 01:00:18.157
An itsy-bitsy teeny-weeny
yellow polka dot bikini.

01:00:18.198 --> 01:00:21.410
So in the locker
she wanted to stay.

01:00:32.338 --> 01:00:34.006
Nein!

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:37.468
C.I.A.?

01:00:48.729 --> 01:00:49.897
Nein.

01:00:50.898 --> 01:00:52.066
Nein.

01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:20.344
C.I.A...

01:01:45.577 --> 01:01:46.745
Borodenko.

01:01:56.672 --> 01:01:58.549
Amerikanischer Spion?

01:01:58.632 --> 01:01:59.925
Moment.

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:01.969
Did you hear that?

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:04.555
He is a confessed American spy.

01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:06.140
In that case, I want
nothing to do with it...

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:08.058
because if they ever
find out in Moscow...

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:10.185
He's right.
No secretary is worth that risk.

01:02:10.269 --> 01:02:11.186
On the other hand...

01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:12.271
why should they
find out in Moscow?

01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:13.522
I will not inform them.

01:02:13.605 --> 01:02:14.773
But if they do find out...

01:02:14.857 --> 01:02:16.984
then we just cross the border
into West Berlin.

01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:19.236
That is easy for you to say.
You are a bachelor.

01:02:19.319 --> 01:02:20.362
But if I defect...

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:22.197
you know what they
will do to my family?

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:24.450
They will line them up against
the wall and shoot them...

01:02:24.533 --> 01:02:26.076
My wife
and my mother-in-law...

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.036
and my sister-in-law
and my brother-in-law.

01:02:29.288 --> 01:02:30.873
Comrades, let's do it.

01:02:50.517 --> 01:02:53.145
You tried to bamboozle us.
You say he's cuckoo clock thief.

01:02:53.187 --> 01:02:55.022
We know he's American spy.

01:02:56.023 --> 01:02:56.940
Shh.

01:02:57.024 --> 01:02:59.401
You'd better get him out of here
before we all get into trouble.

01:02:59.485 --> 01:03:00.652
Right.

01:03:02.905 --> 01:03:05.157
It's a pleasure to do
business with you boys.

01:03:05.199 --> 01:03:08.118
Wait! Where is blond lady?

01:03:08.202 --> 01:03:09.369
I'll send her right over.

01:03:40.192 --> 01:03:41.860
Oh, you poor baby.

01:03:41.902 --> 01:03:44.571
- Did you hurt yourself?
- Let me help you.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.367
He has bamboozled us again.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:12.891
Those Russians...

01:04:12.933 --> 01:04:14.601
I hope they were not
too disappointed.

01:04:14.685 --> 01:04:15.769
That's their problem.

01:04:15.853 --> 01:04:17.855
Actually, they were very cute.

01:04:17.938 --> 01:04:19.606
I can't decide which one
I like the best...

01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:21.942
the big fat one or the bald one.

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:23.193
That's Schlemmer's problem.

01:04:33.287 --> 01:04:34.621
Fritz, what's that behind us?

01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:38.125
Looks like a 1937 Nash.

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:39.376
OK. Step on it.

01:05:48.028 --> 01:05:49.196
Halt!

01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:55.452
You remember us.
We came through earlier.

01:05:55.535 --> 01:05:56.703
You wait.

01:06:14.054 --> 01:06:15.222
Here is empties.

01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:42.541
Let's go, Fritz.

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:03.770
Itsy-bitsy teeny-weeny
yellow polka dot bikini.

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:07.941
Drop dead.

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:27.502
That's enough, Ingeborg.
Cut it out!

01:07:27.544 --> 01:07:29.296
Why are you so
unfriendly this morning?

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:31.256
I thought everything
was wunderbar.

01:07:31.339 --> 01:07:32.507
Some wunderbar.

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:34.468
Can you imagine what's
going to happen at noon...

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:36.553
when the Hazeltines
step off that plane...

01:07:36.636 --> 01:07:39.473
and get a load
of their new son-in-law?

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:40.599
You slob.

01:07:40.682 --> 01:07:43.018
And when he opens
his big fat red mouth...

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:44.061
it's good-bye, Charlie.

01:07:44.144 --> 01:07:45.270
Who is Charlie?

01:07:45.353 --> 01:07:47.230
Charles H. Kaput.

01:07:47.314 --> 01:07:48.857
What's keeping Scarlett?
I wish she'd get here.

01:07:48.899 --> 01:07:50.317
I wish Schlemmer
would get here...

01:07:50.358 --> 01:07:52.486
Or anyway, send my dress back.

01:07:52.527 --> 01:07:53.904
What do you want in this...
Cream, sugar?

01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:54.905
Just a couple of lumps
of Benzedrine.

01:07:54.988 --> 01:07:56.782
It's going to be a rough day.

01:08:12.547 --> 01:08:14.716
You'd better put something on.

01:08:14.758 --> 01:08:16.343
Your goose pimples are showing.

01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:20.721
Ooh, that's nothing.
You should see my sister.

01:08:29.022 --> 01:08:29.981
Where is he?

01:08:30.023 --> 01:08:30.982
Scarlett...

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:33.193
before that maniac wakes up,
I've got to talk to you.

01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:35.069
There's only one way
out of this mess.

01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:37.697
Otto. Otto, darling.

01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:39.658
Otto, it's me... Scarlett.

01:08:39.698 --> 01:08:42.993
Otto. Otto, darling, wake up.

01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:44.746
- Otto.
- Scarlett?

01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:47.916
Darling, I have something
very exciting to tell you.

01:08:47.999 --> 01:08:49.334
How did I get here?

01:08:55.924 --> 01:08:57.884
You!

01:08:57.926 --> 01:08:59.719
I should take that
wedding present...

01:08:59.803 --> 01:09:00.970
and break it over your head.

01:09:01.054 --> 01:09:02.973
That's gratitude after all
the trouble I went through...

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:04.057
to get you out of jail.

01:09:04.099 --> 01:09:05.350
- You got me into jail!
- So we're even.

01:09:05.392 --> 01:09:08.854
You know, yesterday, when you
didn't show up, I fainted.

01:09:08.937 --> 01:09:10.354
It's all his fault.

01:09:10.397 --> 01:09:11.481
Well, not entirely.

01:09:11.523 --> 01:09:13.358
Don't you want to hear
what the doctor said?

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:14.943
Get him some coffee.
He's gonna need it.

01:09:15.026 --> 01:09:16.069
From you,
I don't need anything.

01:09:16.153 --> 01:09:17.487
I'm gonna have a baby.

01:09:17.529 --> 01:09:18.488
If my wife wasn't here...

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:19.990
and if she wasn't gonna
have a baby...

01:09:21.032 --> 01:09:23.368
- What?
- That's right.

01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:25.453
Liebchen! Oh!

01:09:27.956 --> 01:09:29.457
That's just what
the world needs...

01:09:29.541 --> 01:09:31.877
Another bouncing baby Bolshevik.

01:09:33.211 --> 01:09:35.212
I was so afraid
you wouldn't want it.

01:09:35.296 --> 01:09:36.840
Oh, you little fool.
I want dozens!

01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:38.008
So do I.

01:09:38.049 --> 01:09:39.634
So does the Party.
They encourage it.

01:09:39.718 --> 01:09:41.386
We must outproduce the West!

01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:43.721
I hear they got a new plan now.

01:09:43.763 --> 01:09:45.974
Instead of one woman taking
nine months to have a baby...

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:47.017
they're gonna put nine women
to work on it...

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:48.018
and do it in one month.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.352
The minute
we arrive in Moscow...

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:50.604
we must get
on the waiting list...

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:51.854
for the People's
Maternity Ward...

01:09:51.938 --> 01:09:53.481
and the People's Obstetrician.

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:56.276
No. I'd like to fly over
my own doctor from Atlanta...

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:58.195
and my own nurse
and my governess.

01:09:58.236 --> 01:09:59.279
What for?

01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:01.198
The State takes care
of everything!

01:10:01.239 --> 01:10:03.491
At the age of six months,
the baby will be enrolled...

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:05.118
in the People's
Nursery School.

01:10:05.202 --> 01:10:07.037
Naturally, we will have
visiting rights...

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.038
every other Sunday.

01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:09.456
Every other Sunday?

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:12.542
You can bring him some pabulum
with a file in it.

01:10:12.626 --> 01:10:14.878
Imperialist stooge!

01:10:15.629 --> 01:10:17.714
And of course,
we'll see him on May Day.

01:10:17.797 --> 01:10:19.341
He'll be marching by
in the parade.

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:21.176
We can wave to him.

01:10:21.301 --> 01:10:23.511
You can also wave to him
on Lenin's birthday...

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:25.513
and on Yuri Gagarin's birthday.

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:26.973
That kid will be parading
all the time.

01:10:27.057 --> 01:10:29.517
Well, at least
it'll keep him off the streets.

01:10:29.601 --> 01:10:30.810
The tickets.

01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:32.270
Where are the tickets?

01:10:32.354 --> 01:10:34.272
We must find out when the next
train leaves for Moscow.

01:10:34.856 --> 01:10:37.692
Forget it, Piffl.
You're not going to Moscow.

01:10:37.776 --> 01:10:39.903
You can't even
get back to East Berlin.

01:10:39.986 --> 01:10:41.071
Why not?

01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:43.198
Because you're an American spy.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.449
Who said so?

01:10:44.532 --> 01:10:45.450
You did.

01:10:45.533 --> 01:10:46.701
Don't you remember last night
at the police station?

01:10:46.785 --> 01:10:49.913
You signed a confession...
An amerikanischer Spion.

01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:52.082
Nein.

01:10:52.666 --> 01:10:53.833
Ja!

01:10:54.501 --> 01:10:55.418
Isn't that thrilling?

01:10:55.502 --> 01:10:57.671
Darling, why didn't you tell me?

01:10:57.712 --> 01:10:58.880
But I'm...

01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:00.548
I'm not a spy! It's not true!

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:01.549
Makes you think, doesn't it...

01:11:01.633 --> 01:11:03.343
about all those other
confessions they get?

01:11:03.385 --> 01:11:04.344
Another hour,
and they'd have had you...

01:11:04.386 --> 01:11:06.972
confessing to
germ warfare in Laos.

01:11:07.055 --> 01:11:08.848
You did this to me.

01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:09.891
You mean I gave you
the third degree?

01:11:09.975 --> 01:11:10.976
Or was it your Communist chums?

01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:11.977
You will come with me.

01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:12.978
You will tell them
it was a trick.

01:11:13.019 --> 01:11:13.979
Are you kidding?

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:16.398
Do you think they'd believe me,
an imperialist stooge?

01:11:16.481 --> 01:11:17.565
I shall kill you!

01:11:17.649 --> 01:11:19.276
Take it easy, kid,
or you'll wind up...

01:11:19.359 --> 01:11:20.986
in the People's
Emergency Hospital.

01:11:22.904 --> 01:11:26.283
Otto, darling, what are we
gonna call the baby?

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:36.209
My dress!
What did you do to my dress?

01:11:36.251 --> 01:11:37.711
Schlemmer.

01:11:37.752 --> 01:11:38.712
Yes, sir.

01:11:38.753 --> 01:11:40.255
I'm sorry I didn't
shave this morning.

01:11:40.338 --> 01:11:42.215
Look at my dress. It's ruined.

01:11:42.257 --> 01:11:43.717
You have any trouble
getting out of East Berlin?

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.719
No, but I had a little trouble
in West Berlin.

01:11:45.802 --> 01:11:47.595
I was picked up by
an American soldier in a Jeep.

01:11:47.679 --> 01:11:49.222
He was very fresh...

01:11:49.264 --> 01:11:51.766
Wanted to take my picture
for something called "Playboy"?

01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:53.935
Get out of those silly clothes.
We've got a lot of work to do.

01:11:54.019 --> 01:11:55.770
Yes, sir.
If I can have my suit.

01:11:55.854 --> 01:11:57.022
It's in your office.

01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:07.532
And it's gonna be
such fun shopping.

01:12:07.615 --> 01:12:10.035
We need a bassinet
and a crib and a layette...

01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:12.620
and we have to run down
to Paris for a few days.

01:12:12.704 --> 01:12:14.706
They have some marvy
maternity clothes...

01:12:14.748 --> 01:12:15.957
at Christian Dior's.

01:12:16.041 --> 01:12:17.375
Darling, you have to
forget all that.

01:12:17.459 --> 01:12:19.169
We can't even afford
milk for the baby.

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:21.671
Oh, the doctors have
a whole new theory.

01:12:21.713 --> 01:12:23.548
Milk's the worst thing
for babies.

01:12:23.631 --> 01:12:25.550
Scarlett, don't you understand?

01:12:25.633 --> 01:12:28.219
I am through, finished,
ausgespielt.

01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:29.637
To the Communists,
I'm an American spy.

01:12:29.721 --> 01:12:31.556
To the Americans,
I'm a Communist.

01:12:31.598 --> 01:12:34.309
I have nothing...
No home, no job...

01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:36.019
not even my motorcycle.

01:12:36.102 --> 01:12:38.646
That's tough.
All you got is a rich wife.

01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:41.316
He's right.
In January, when I'm eighteen...

01:12:41.358 --> 01:12:43.985
Daddy's giving me ten thousand
shares of Coca-Cola stock.

01:12:44.027 --> 01:12:46.196
I'm a worker, not a gigolo!

01:12:46.237 --> 01:12:47.697
I will not take
any money from you.

01:12:47.781 --> 01:12:49.032
You bet you won't!

01:12:49.074 --> 01:12:50.658
Because when your father
finds out who you married...

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:53.078
he'll cut you off
without a red cent.

01:12:53.161 --> 01:12:54.245
You should
pardon the expression.

01:12:54.329 --> 01:12:55.330
I guess so.

01:12:55.413 --> 01:12:57.415
Daddy has a fit every time
I order anything...

01:12:57.499 --> 01:12:58.917
with Russian dressing.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.210
Looks bad, doesn't it?

01:13:00.251 --> 01:13:01.211
But it's a good thing
I like you kids.

01:13:01.252 --> 01:13:02.212
I'm gonna help you...

01:13:02.253 --> 01:13:03.838
if idiot-boy here
will cooperate.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.339
You go to hell!

01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:06.925
Long distance.

01:13:07.008 --> 01:13:09.177
Mr. Hazeltine
calling from London.

01:13:10.261 --> 01:13:11.221
London?

01:13:11.262 --> 01:13:13.139
Uh-oh. The bloodhounds
are closing in.

01:13:14.557 --> 01:13:16.684
Hello? Yes, Mr. Hazeltine.
This is MacNamara.

01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:18.603
MacNamara, I'm gonna
have your head for this.

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:20.563
What do you mean, for what?

01:13:20.647 --> 01:13:21.898
We get off
at the London airport...

01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:22.941
to change planes...

01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:24.859
and there's this telegram
waiting for me.

01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:25.860
"Congratulations."

01:13:25.902 --> 01:13:27.612
"You are going to be
a grandfather."

01:13:27.695 --> 01:13:28.947
"Signed, MacNamara."

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:30.198
Is this your idea of a joke?

01:13:30.698 --> 01:13:32.700
No, it's not my idea of a joke.

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:34.369
Did somebody send
a telegram to your father?

01:13:34.452 --> 01:13:36.955
Yes, Mrs. MacNamara.

01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:38.206
Oh, she did.

01:13:39.082 --> 01:13:40.125
Yes, it's true.

01:13:40.208 --> 01:13:41.334
We didn't want you
to be too surprised...

01:13:41.376 --> 01:13:42.544
when you got here.

01:13:43.711 --> 01:13:46.005
MacNamara, I send you
a sweet, pure, innocent girl...

01:13:46.047 --> 01:13:47.465
who isn't even
eighteen yet, and...

01:13:48.716 --> 01:13:49.884
What?

01:13:50.718 --> 01:13:52.971
It's all right, Melanie.
She's married.

01:13:53.054 --> 01:13:54.222
Oh, thank heaven.

01:13:54.305 --> 01:13:56.599
Wait a minute, MacNamara!
Not so fast!

01:13:56.641 --> 01:13:58.643
Just exactly who
is she married to?

01:13:59.644 --> 01:14:01.271
Oh, uh, I wouldn't
worry about it.

01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:04.023
He's a wonderful boy...
Handsome, cultured...

01:14:04.107 --> 01:14:06.776
comes from one
of the best families in Europe.

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.361
You'll be crazy about him.

01:14:08.445 --> 01:14:10.363
Yes, sir. We'll bring him along
to the airport with us.

01:14:10.405 --> 01:14:11.573
Happy landing.

01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:14.159
Schlemmer!

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.243
What are you up to now?

01:14:15.326 --> 01:14:17.704
All those lies.
You can't fool Daddy that easy.

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:19.122
I didn't say it was
gonna be easy...

01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:20.206
but we sure can try.

01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:21.332
Try what?

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:24.294
We're gonna turn this crumb bum
into a perfect son-in-law...

01:14:24.377 --> 01:14:26.129
and we've got exactly
three hours and two minutes...

01:14:26.212 --> 01:14:27.130
to do it in.

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:29.132
Oh, I get it. Isn't he clever?

01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:30.133
Schlemmer!

01:14:30.216 --> 01:14:32.218
I categorically refuse!

01:14:32.302 --> 01:14:33.303
Sorry, sir.

01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:34.888
I had difficulty
getting out of the girdle.

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:36.890
Schlemmer, I want all
of those people out there...

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:39.184
to drop everything
and stand by for orders.

01:14:39.267 --> 01:14:41.269
General alarm,
complete mobilization.

01:14:41.352 --> 01:14:42.562
Ah! Like the good old days.

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:43.688
Yes, sir.

01:14:43.771 --> 01:14:45.899
I will not be a party
to this scheme.

01:14:45.982 --> 01:14:47.150
OK, if you don't love your wife.

01:14:47.192 --> 01:14:48.359
I worship her!

01:14:48.401 --> 01:14:50.153
You know there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you...

01:14:50.195 --> 01:14:52.864
but I will not
compromise my principles!

01:14:52.947 --> 01:14:54.449
And I'd do anything for you...

01:14:54.532 --> 01:14:56.534
even if we had
to starve together...

01:14:56.618 --> 01:14:59.704
but we can't ask the baby
to starve, not at his age!

01:14:59.787 --> 01:15:00.705
See, you're
upsetting your wife.

01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:01.706
Think of her condition.

01:15:01.789 --> 01:15:04.292
I will not be turned
into a capitalist!

01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:06.336
Once you are a son-in-law
in good standing...

01:15:06.377 --> 01:15:07.545
I don't care what you do.

01:15:07.587 --> 01:15:09.422
You can steal
the formula to Coca-Cola...

01:15:09.464 --> 01:15:11.090
and square yourself with Moscow.

01:15:11.174 --> 01:15:12.217
But at noon today...

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:15.261
you are going to look and act
like a gentleman!

01:15:20.350 --> 01:15:22.393
Everybody at their posts
awaiting orders.

01:15:23.353 --> 01:15:24.270
All right. Here we go.

01:15:24.354 --> 01:15:25.688
First, get a barber
and a manicurist...

01:15:25.772 --> 01:15:26.689
up to the office.

01:15:26.773 --> 01:15:28.691
Next, call my lawyer.
I want him here immediately.

01:15:28.775 --> 01:15:29.692
Next, I want to speak
to the manager...

01:15:29.776 --> 01:15:30.693
of the Berlin Hilton.

01:15:30.777 --> 01:15:31.861
Next, get ahold
of what's-his-name...

01:15:31.903 --> 01:15:32.862
You know,
that moth-eaten count...

01:15:32.904 --> 01:15:34.864
the one that used to
hang around at the Cafe Wien.

01:15:34.948 --> 01:15:35.865
Count von Droste-Schattenburg?

01:15:35.949 --> 01:15:37.867
That's the one.
I want to see him right away.

01:15:37.951 --> 01:15:38.993
Yes, sir.

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:40.036
And send Ingeborg in here
with pad and pencil.

01:15:40.119 --> 01:15:42.372
- Yes, sir.
- Schnellmachen. 1, 2, 3!

01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:44.499
- Ja!
- All right.

01:15:44.624 --> 01:15:46.209
Next, we'd better
start cleaning him up.

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:48.211
- Over there.
- I've agreed to nothing!

01:15:48.294 --> 01:15:50.922
Is it against the party line
to use indoor plumbing?

01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:53.174
Come on, darling.
It won't hurt a bit.

01:15:53.216 --> 01:15:56.052
Even if it hurts,
mit the hot water mit the soap.

01:15:58.513 --> 01:16:00.348
- Yes, Mr. MacNamara.
- Ready?

01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:01.516
Always ready.

01:16:02.517 --> 01:16:03.643
First, call...

01:16:03.685 --> 01:16:05.687
Reinhardt and Reinhardt
custom tailors...

01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:06.854
and have them send up everything
they've got in their shop...

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:09.190
Single-breasted, three-buttoned,
narrow lapels,

01:16:09.274 --> 01:16:12.277
medium-gray to dark blue,
size... uh, thirty-nine regular.

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.279
Next, call
Pleschke the haberdasher.

01:16:14.362 --> 01:16:15.321
I want to see some shirts.

01:16:15.363 --> 01:16:16.698
Broadcloth,
plain or tab collar...

01:16:16.781 --> 01:16:18.575
size... 15 1/2, 34.

01:16:18.658 --> 01:16:20.702
Shorts... nylon or cotton,
size thirty-two.

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:23.037
Socks... French lisle,
dark-toned, size 11 1/2.

01:16:23.121 --> 01:16:25.456
Ties... not too wide,
not too narrow, not too fancy.

01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:26.541
Also, pajamas, handkerchiefs...

01:16:26.624 --> 01:16:28.793
cuff links, suspenders,
et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:28.876 --> 01:16:29.794
Next, call Hochstaetter's.

01:16:29.877 --> 01:16:32.338
Have them deliver some shoes...
British or Italian models...

01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:33.673
brown and black, size 9B.

01:16:35.383 --> 01:16:36.384
Yes, Fritz.

01:16:36.467 --> 01:16:37.677
No, Fritz. I need you.

01:16:37.719 --> 01:16:40.388
Sleepy or not sleepy,
everybody works today.

01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:42.432
Next, call
any first-class hatter.

01:16:42.515 --> 01:16:43.683
I want an assortment of hats...

01:16:43.725 --> 01:16:46.853
No porkpies, none of that
Tyrolean jazz, size 7 3/8.

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:50.273
Uh, correction...
After we cut his hair, 7 1/8.

01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:52.525
Next, call that department store
on Tauenzienstrasse.

01:16:52.567 --> 01:16:54.360
Have them bring up a matched set
of men's luggage...

01:16:54.444 --> 01:16:55.361
cowhide or pigskin.

01:16:55.445 --> 01:16:57.030
Next, call the Ritz jewelers.

01:16:57.071 --> 01:16:58.448
I want to see a selection
of gold wedding rings.

01:16:58.531 --> 01:17:00.575
Also, engagement rings...
Diamond solitaire...

01:17:00.658 --> 01:17:02.410
no less than two carats,
no more than four.

01:17:02.493 --> 01:17:04.662
Make sure he scrubs
behind his ears.

01:17:04.704 --> 01:17:05.913
Next, call
Kottler's Restaurant.

01:17:05.997 --> 01:17:08.082
Have them send up one
deluxe seven-course dinner...

01:17:08.166 --> 01:17:09.208
and one complete table setting.

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:10.877
Next, call a florist,
and have them make up...

01:17:10.918 --> 01:17:12.211
a bouquet of chrysanthemums.

01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:13.796
Also, two boutonnieres...
White carnations.

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.381
Any questions?

01:17:15.465 --> 01:17:18.217
Yes. Can I go home
and get some clothes?

01:17:18.259 --> 01:17:19.802
At a time like this?

01:17:19.886 --> 01:17:21.554
Dressed or not dressed,
everybody works today.

01:17:21.596 --> 01:17:22.930
Now get with it.

01:17:23.014 --> 01:17:23.931
Haarschnitt.

01:17:24.015 --> 01:17:25.224
- Manicure?
- Not me... him.

01:17:25.308 --> 01:17:26.476
Take him into
the conference room...

01:17:26.517 --> 01:17:27.477
and chop that mop off.

01:17:27.518 --> 01:17:28.478
Jawohl.

01:17:28.519 --> 01:17:29.479
And give him a shave
and a manicure.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:30.480
Jawohl.

01:17:30.521 --> 01:17:32.482
- No!
- What do you mean, no?

01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:33.691
No manicure.

01:17:33.775 --> 01:17:36.402
It's a symbol of bourgeois
decadence and insecurity.

01:17:36.486 --> 01:17:38.112
Oh, sure. In Russia,
everybody is so secure...

01:17:38.196 --> 01:17:39.405
they chew their nails off.

01:17:39.489 --> 01:17:41.449
Come on, darling.
Nobody will ever know.

01:17:41.532 --> 01:17:42.450
You can wear gloves.

01:17:42.533 --> 01:17:43.451
Gloves?

01:17:43.534 --> 01:17:45.870
Why don't you ask me
to wear striped pants?

01:17:49.499 --> 01:17:51.376
Ingeborg, when you
talk to that tailor...

01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:52.794
I also want some
striped pants...

01:17:52.877 --> 01:17:54.462
a morning coat,
and a white waistcoat.

01:17:56.381 --> 01:17:58.383
I have located
Count von Droste-Schattenburg.

01:17:58.466 --> 01:17:59.384
Good!

01:17:59.467 --> 01:18:01.427
He's working the men's room
at the Kempinski Hotel.

01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:02.428
How soon can he get here?

01:18:02.512 --> 01:18:03.888
Well, this is
his busy time of the day.

01:18:03.971 --> 01:18:05.098
He wants to know
if you can come there.

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:06.099
Absolutely not.

01:18:06.182 --> 01:18:07.600
I'll tell him.
And your lawyer is here.

01:18:07.684 --> 01:18:09.018
Come in!

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:12.647
Ah, Herr MacNamara,
isn't this a glorious day?

01:18:12.689 --> 01:18:14.357
Cut the schmooze.
Now, listen, Zeidlitz.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:15.483
Here's what I want you to do.

01:18:15.525 --> 01:18:18.027
It has already been done.
Complete success.

01:18:18.069 --> 01:18:20.363
The young lady can
consider herself unmarried.

01:18:20.446 --> 01:18:21.364
Unmarried?

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:22.532
It wasn't easy...

01:18:22.573 --> 01:18:24.325
but I managed to liberate
that marriage license...

01:18:24.367 --> 01:18:26.869
from the files in East Berlin
just like you ordered.

01:18:26.911 --> 01:18:28.663
It's that damned
German efficiency.

01:18:28.746 --> 01:18:30.039
That's all I need now...

01:18:30.123 --> 01:18:31.624
An illegitimate baby
on my hands.

01:18:31.666 --> 01:18:32.625
I beg your pardon.

01:18:32.667 --> 01:18:33.626
He's bringing the shoes.

01:18:33.668 --> 01:18:35.628
Shoes? Unpack them.
Let's see what you've got.

01:18:35.670 --> 01:18:37.672
I want you to go back
to East Berlin...

01:18:37.755 --> 01:18:40.341
and put that marriage license
right back in the file.

01:18:40.383 --> 01:18:41.384
If you say so.

01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:42.927
But first, I want you
to draw up some adoption papers.

01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:45.388
- For the baby?
- No, for Otto Ludwig Piffl.

01:18:45.471 --> 01:18:46.389
We're going to
have him adopted...

01:18:46.472 --> 01:18:48.599
by a real honest-to-goodness,
blue-blooded aristocrat.

01:18:48.683 --> 01:18:50.101
- Oh, a baron.
- Better than that.

01:18:50.184 --> 01:18:51.310
The guy who is working
in the men's room...

01:18:51.352 --> 01:18:52.311
at the Kempinski.

01:18:52.353 --> 01:18:53.312
- Who?
- Leave the name blank.

01:18:53.354 --> 01:18:56.190
I haven't made the deal yet.
Now get to work. In there.

01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:59.026
Next, shoes.
No, no. Nothing with tassels.

01:18:59.110 --> 01:19:00.153
Those are all right.

01:19:00.194 --> 01:19:02.071
Alligator?
That's for bandleaders.

01:19:02.155 --> 01:19:03.698
Those are OK. OK.

01:19:05.366 --> 01:19:07.201
Totally unacceptable.
Full of holes.

01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:08.411
Guten Morgen.

01:19:08.494 --> 01:19:09.954
Reinhardt from
Reinhardt and Reinhardt.

01:19:10.037 --> 01:19:10.955
Be right with you.

01:19:11.038 --> 01:19:12.957
I'll take those and those
but not those.

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.041
Now, what have we got here?

01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:15.877
Latest English styles.
All fabrics imported.

01:19:15.918 --> 01:19:17.420
They look more like
they were deported.

01:19:17.503 --> 01:19:19.046
Too loud. Too quiet.
All right...

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:20.882
but take the padding
out of the shoulders.

01:19:20.965 --> 01:19:23.593
That's not bad.
Belt on the back?

01:19:23.676 --> 01:19:24.719
I thought that went out
with high-buttoned shoes.

01:19:24.802 --> 01:19:26.721
High-buttoned shoes?
I have some right here.

01:19:26.804 --> 01:19:27.722
Never mind.
Take that stuff...

01:19:27.805 --> 01:19:28.723
into the conference room.

01:19:28.806 --> 01:19:29.682
I want these ready
in twenty-four hours.

01:19:29.807 --> 01:19:30.767
Twenty-four hours?

01:19:30.850 --> 01:19:31.768
Where's the morning coat
and striped pants?

01:19:31.851 --> 01:19:32.810
My assistant is bringing them.

01:19:32.852 --> 01:19:34.103
Those I want fitted right away.

01:19:34.187 --> 01:19:36.314
- Schmuck.
- What did you say?

01:19:36.355 --> 01:19:38.232
Schmuck. Jewelry.

01:19:38.316 --> 01:19:40.359
Oh. Come with me. You, too.

01:19:44.781 --> 01:19:45.865
Sitzen machen.

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:48.659
A strong, healthy girl like you,
you should not be cutting nails.

01:19:48.701 --> 01:19:50.620
You should be cutting
wheat in the Ukraine.

01:19:50.703 --> 01:19:51.829
No, no.
Leave it a little longer...

01:19:51.871 --> 01:19:53.581
on the sides, like Sal Mineo.

01:19:53.664 --> 01:19:54.624
Pick a couple of wedding rings.

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:56.167
Left foot, please.

01:19:56.209 --> 01:19:57.293
Do you like these?

01:19:57.376 --> 01:19:58.419
Gold? Never.

01:19:58.503 --> 01:20:00.546
I prefer the honest steel
of the guns of Stalingrad.

01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:02.590
Come on. You guys are always
yakking about disarmament.

01:20:02.673 --> 01:20:04.383
We might as well start
right here and now.

01:20:04.467 --> 01:20:05.426
Stand up, please.

01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:06.427
He's also giving you
an engagement ring.

01:20:06.511 --> 01:20:07.428
- He is?
- I am?

01:20:07.512 --> 01:20:09.222
They're too big.

01:20:09.263 --> 01:20:11.348
I assume the gentleman
will wear socks.

01:20:11.349 --> 01:20:12.350
Not if I can help it.

01:20:12.433 --> 01:20:14.477
Waist thirty-one.
Sit down, please.

01:20:14.519 --> 01:20:15.478
I want this one.

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:16.854
How much? Eight thousand marks.

01:20:16.896 --> 01:20:17.855
Thank you, darling.

01:20:17.897 --> 01:20:19.899
Wait! Who's paying
for this foolishness?

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:21.984
Relax. You've got assets...
All that Coca-Cola stock.

01:20:22.026 --> 01:20:23.027
You expect me to
sit on my assets...

01:20:23.069 --> 01:20:24.028
and just clip coupons?

01:20:24.111 --> 01:20:26.072
Don't worry.
The baby will clip the coupons.

01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:27.156
We'll put all
the money in his name.

01:20:27.198 --> 01:20:28.199
Sit down, please.

01:20:28.241 --> 01:20:30.660
I will not have my son
grow up to be a capitalist!

01:20:30.701 --> 01:20:32.411
When he's eighteen,
he can decide for himself...

01:20:32.495 --> 01:20:33.746
whether he wants
to be a capitalist...

01:20:33.788 --> 01:20:35.373
or a rich Communist.

01:20:39.126 --> 01:20:41.712
Yes? Who? The manager
of the Berlin Hilton?

01:20:41.796 --> 01:20:43.047
Put him on.

01:20:43.089 --> 01:20:44.048
Over there.

01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:46.300
Hello? I want to reserve
the bridal suite.

01:20:46.384 --> 01:20:48.177
Yes, checking in today.

01:20:48.219 --> 01:20:50.429
I didn't ask you
how much it cost.

01:20:50.513 --> 01:20:52.515
This is for the son-in-law
of an American millionaire.

01:20:52.598 --> 01:20:53.808
Double bed, naturally.
Silk sheets.

01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:56.519
Tell them we don't need
a table and chairs.

01:20:56.561 --> 01:20:58.521
We're going to have
all our meals in bed.

01:20:58.604 --> 01:20:59.730
Never mind the silk sheets.

01:20:59.814 --> 01:21:02.316
Just make it a tablecloth
and two napkins.

01:21:03.276 --> 01:21:06.028
Silk sheets, diamond rings,
bridal suites.

01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:08.614
What is this,
"La Dolce Vita"?

01:21:08.698 --> 01:21:10.575
Hey! What are you doing?

01:21:10.658 --> 01:21:11.784
Stop it! Are you crazy?

01:21:11.868 --> 01:21:13.744
The haberdasher's
in your office.

01:21:13.828 --> 01:21:16.038
Keep an eye
on the Kremlin Kid.

01:21:16.956 --> 01:21:19.833
There's a newspaperman here
to see you from the "Tageblatt."

01:21:19.834 --> 01:21:21.627
Not today.

01:21:22.837 --> 01:21:24.714
Sitzen machen.

01:21:24.755 --> 01:21:26.716
No, no. White shirts only.
Two dozen. French cuff.

01:21:26.799 --> 01:21:27.717
Jawohl.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.010
Handkerchiefs, OK.
Socks, fine.

01:21:29.051 --> 01:21:30.970
If he objects, we'll just
have to paint his feet black.

01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:31.971
- Jawohl.
- Where are the pajamas?

01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:32.972
Right here.

01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:34.015
OK. OK. What's this?

01:21:34.056 --> 01:21:34.974
They're beautiful.

01:21:35.057 --> 01:21:36.976
- They are terrible.
- They are terrible.

01:21:37.018 --> 01:21:38.978
Let's see the ties.
Jawohl, nix, jawohl, jawohl...

01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:40.688
definitely nix.
This is the best.

01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:41.689
It is mine.

01:21:41.772 --> 01:21:43.024
Take it off. I'm buying it.

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:44.150
Good morning, Phyllis.

01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:46.027
Looks like the Berlin branch
of Macy's Basement.

01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:48.321
You have no idea.
It's a rat race around here.

01:21:48.362 --> 01:21:49.322
And I know the rat.

01:21:49.363 --> 01:21:50.823
This robe,
it is jawohl or nix?

01:21:50.865 --> 01:21:52.366
Sit down, Phyllis.
I'll be right with you.

01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:53.367
Don't bother.

01:21:53.409 --> 01:21:55.119
I just want
something from the safe.

01:21:56.621 --> 01:21:59.540
- What's the combination?
- 22-5-17.

01:22:00.416 --> 01:22:01.542
All right.
Throw that robe in...

01:22:01.584 --> 01:22:03.377
and start taking this stuff
into the conference room.

01:22:03.461 --> 01:22:04.712
- Jawohl.
- That guy in there...

01:22:04.795 --> 01:22:06.255
don't tell him
those are French cuffs...

01:22:06.339 --> 01:22:08.549
not with the Algerian
situation the way it is.

01:22:09.216 --> 01:22:10.551
What are you looking for?

01:22:11.093 --> 01:22:12.219
Here they are. The passports.

01:22:12.303 --> 01:22:13.220
Passports?

01:22:13.304 --> 01:22:15.514
I'm flying back to the states,
and I'm taking the kids with me.

01:22:15.556 --> 01:22:17.475
- You're what?
- You heard me.

01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:19.894
What are you sore about now?
I got Otto back, didn't I?

01:22:19.977 --> 01:22:20.895
I'm remodeling him.

01:22:20.978 --> 01:22:22.688
Somebody should do
a little job on you.

01:22:22.772 --> 01:22:23.773
Good-bye, Mac.

01:22:23.856 --> 01:22:25.691
Phyllis, you can't
walk out on me like this.

01:22:25.775 --> 01:22:26.817
I'm not walking out.

01:22:26.859 --> 01:22:28.277
I'm just going back
where I belong...

01:22:28.361 --> 01:22:29.737
and any time you'd
care to join us...

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:30.863
we'll be waiting for you.

01:22:30.947 --> 01:22:32.531
The adoption papers,
they are ready.

01:22:32.615 --> 01:22:33.783
Heraus.

01:22:34.367 --> 01:22:36.619
What's come over you, Phyllis?
After sixteen years...

01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:37.954
Maybe after sixteen years...

01:22:38.037 --> 01:22:39.705
every marriage
gets a little stale...

01:22:39.789 --> 01:22:41.123
like a leftover glass of beer.

01:22:41.207 --> 01:22:42.750
Look, Phyllis, can't we
discuss this problem...

01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:44.377
without bringing up
a rival beverage?

01:22:44.418 --> 01:22:46.712
I hope these vaccination
certificates are still good.

01:22:46.796 --> 01:22:48.714
Look, Phyllis, you knew
the kind of a guy I was...

01:22:48.798 --> 01:22:49.715
when you married me.

01:22:49.799 --> 01:22:50.716
Apparently not.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.218
I'm not one
of those suburban jokers...

01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:54.553
9:00 to 5:00 in the office,
home on the commuter train...

01:22:54.595 --> 01:22:55.680
cut the grass every weekend.

01:22:55.721 --> 01:22:57.890
Turns out I married Marco Polo.

01:22:58.015 --> 01:23:00.476
Well, it wasn't all that bad,
those sixteen years.

01:23:00.518 --> 01:23:01.686
We've had some fun.

01:23:01.769 --> 01:23:04.105
Remember Teheran
when Cindy was born...

01:23:04.188 --> 01:23:06.774
driving 12 miles to the hospital
in a Coca-Cola truck?

01:23:06.857 --> 01:23:07.775
Some fun.

01:23:07.858 --> 01:23:09.860
And remember when I had Tommy?

01:23:09.944 --> 01:23:11.529
Do I ever.
Right in the Zurich airport.

01:23:11.612 --> 01:23:14.031
We had a hell of a time
getting him out of customs.

01:23:14.073 --> 01:23:16.325
And how about our honeymoon,
that wonderful week in Waikiki?

01:23:16.367 --> 01:23:19.912
Yeah, me upstairs putting
perfume behind my ears.

01:23:19.954 --> 01:23:22.707
You downstairs
at a soft drink convention.

01:23:22.748 --> 01:23:25.376
Four hundred men running around
in grass skirts.

01:23:25.459 --> 01:23:27.378
I should have said aloha
right then and there.

01:23:27.461 --> 01:23:29.255
Now, be a good girl
and give me those.

01:23:29.338 --> 01:23:30.881
Let's talk this over.

01:23:30.923 --> 01:23:32.800
All right. I'm willing.

01:23:35.594 --> 01:23:36.554
But not right now.

01:23:36.595 --> 01:23:37.888
The Hazeltines
will be here at noon.

01:23:37.972 --> 01:23:39.223
I've got a deadline.

01:23:39.306 --> 01:23:41.267
You've got a deadline with me.

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:42.476
Phyllis, baby,
I love you.

01:23:42.518 --> 01:23:44.854
Take my word for it.
Everything is going to be fine.

01:23:44.937 --> 01:23:47.023
We'll be living in London.
Tommy can go to Oxford.

01:23:47.106 --> 01:23:48.733
Cindy can watch
the changing of the guard.

01:23:48.816 --> 01:23:50.526
We can afford one
of those snooty butlers...

01:23:50.568 --> 01:23:51.861
kippers and marmalade
for breakfast...

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:53.612
riding to hounds.

01:23:55.114 --> 01:23:57.533
I will not be caught dead
in striped pants.

01:23:57.575 --> 01:23:59.285
They're for bankers
and war profiteers.

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:00.619
Actually, they were ordered...

01:24:00.703 --> 01:24:03.539
by the ambassador from the
People's Republic of Yugoslavia.

01:24:03.622 --> 01:24:05.458
We will deal with Tito
when the time comes.

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:06.876
Meanwhile, take them off
and fix them.

01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:07.877
They're much too big.

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:08.919
In front of the lady?

01:24:09.003 --> 01:24:11.380
Oh, yeah, I... I forgot.
He doesn't wear shorts.

01:24:11.464 --> 01:24:13.007
No wonder they're
winning the Cold War.

01:24:13.132 --> 01:24:14.884
All right. In the other room.

01:24:18.596 --> 01:24:19.764
Don't go away, Phyllis.

01:24:22.892 --> 01:24:25.186
Ingeborg, get him some shorts.

01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:26.520
Sitzen machen.

01:24:31.150 --> 01:24:32.693
Good morning, Mrs. MacNamara.

01:24:32.777 --> 01:24:33.736
Guten Morgen.

01:24:33.819 --> 01:24:36.947
Shorts. Let me see.
Where are the shorts?

01:24:38.074 --> 01:24:40.367
You could use some yourself.

01:24:40.451 --> 01:24:42.536
Oh, I don't
want you to think...

01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:44.455
I come to the office
like this every day.

01:24:44.538 --> 01:24:45.956
That's a load off my mind.

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:47.374
It's just that last night...

01:24:47.458 --> 01:24:49.210
Mr. MacNamara
made me take my dress off.

01:24:49.251 --> 01:24:50.211
Playful, isn't he?

01:24:50.252 --> 01:24:51.712
Oh, he had
a perfect right to.

01:24:51.796 --> 01:24:53.130
After all, he paid for it.

01:24:53.214 --> 01:24:54.882
Well, that makes
all the difference.

01:24:54.924 --> 01:24:56.383
No, no, no.
You don't understand.

01:24:56.467 --> 01:24:59.887
It's part of my job...
what you call fringe benefits.

01:25:00.888 --> 01:25:04.225
How do you like that?
The son of a...

01:25:04.308 --> 01:25:06.477
is starting
his own Marshall Plan.

01:25:06.519 --> 01:25:08.854
Oh, here. I go now.

01:25:08.896 --> 01:25:11.190
We both go now.

01:25:12.274 --> 01:25:14.026
Will you please give
my husband a message?

01:25:14.068 --> 01:25:15.528
Tell him I said aloha.

01:25:15.569 --> 01:25:16.529
Aloha?

01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:18.405
That's Hawaiian for "get lost."

01:25:21.784 --> 01:25:22.743
What's holding up those shorts?

01:25:22.827 --> 01:25:23.744
Right here.

01:25:23.828 --> 01:25:26.455
And your wife said
to tell you aloha.

01:25:26.539 --> 01:25:29.166
That's Hawaiian for "get lost."

01:25:29.208 --> 01:25:30.584
Phyllis!

01:25:38.467 --> 01:25:39.885
The dinner,
where do you want it?

01:25:39.969 --> 01:25:41.387
In the conference room.

01:25:42.555 --> 01:25:43.514
Phyllis!

01:25:43.556 --> 01:25:45.391
Mr. MacNamara,
my name is Untermeier.

01:25:45.474 --> 01:25:46.684
I'm a reporter
from the "Tageblatt."

01:25:46.725 --> 01:25:48.352
Don't bother me.
Some other time.

01:25:48.435 --> 01:25:49.687
But this is important.

01:25:49.728 --> 01:25:51.522
We have information that
Miss Hazeltine of Coca-Cola...

01:25:51.605 --> 01:25:53.274
married somebody
in East Berlin...

01:25:53.357 --> 01:25:54.650
a member
of the Communist Party.

01:25:54.692 --> 01:25:56.527
Sitzen machen.

01:25:56.569 --> 01:25:58.529
I will not wear these.
They look ridiculous.

01:25:58.612 --> 01:25:59.697
They serve no useful purpose.

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:01.365
Darling, it's just a convention.

01:26:01.448 --> 01:26:03.534
Back home, we even put
panties on lamb chops.

01:26:03.617 --> 01:26:05.786
They are drip and dry.
50% nylon.

01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:09.081
Nylon? That's DuPont.
I'll wear no monopoly.

01:26:09.123 --> 01:26:11.250
They're also 50% cotton.
That'll help...

01:26:11.333 --> 01:26:12.668
those sharecroppers
in Mississippi.

01:26:12.710 --> 01:26:15.004
All right. Sit down.
Let's see how you eat.

01:26:15.045 --> 01:26:18.465
Eat? That's the first
good idea he's had.

01:26:18.549 --> 01:26:19.842
I'm starving.

01:26:19.884 --> 01:26:21.135
No, not like that.

01:26:21.218 --> 01:26:22.720
Start with the first course.

01:26:22.761 --> 01:26:24.597
We have to teach him
some table manners.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.849
No, no. One at a time.

01:26:26.932 --> 01:26:29.101
And use the asparagus
tongs, darling.

01:26:29.185 --> 01:26:30.102
The what?

01:26:30.186 --> 01:26:31.937
Those little
grabbers over there.

01:26:34.773 --> 01:26:36.066
Why can't I have my chicken?

01:26:36.150 --> 01:26:38.068
Luggage.
OK. Fill those up...

01:26:38.152 --> 01:26:39.528
and take them over to
the bridal suite at the Hilton.

01:26:39.612 --> 01:26:41.071
You want initials on the bags?

01:26:41.155 --> 01:26:43.115
Initials? He doesn't
even have a name yet.

01:26:43.199 --> 01:26:44.366
No!

01:26:45.034 --> 01:26:45.951
He's right, darling.

01:26:46.035 --> 01:26:48.162
Always white wine with chicken.

01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:51.123
Out of a glass, stupid.

01:26:51.165 --> 01:26:53.334
Yeah, you know everything.

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:55.711
Which wine to drink,
which fork to use for fish...

01:26:55.794 --> 01:26:58.464
which knife to stab the
proletariat in the back with.

01:26:58.547 --> 01:27:01.091
How would you like
a little fruit for dessert?

01:27:01.175 --> 01:27:03.093
The Count is waiting
in the office.

01:27:03.177 --> 01:27:04.887
All right.
Scarlett, keep working on him.

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:06.889
Here, darling.
Use the finger bowl.

01:27:06.972 --> 01:27:08.515
No, no. Don't pack
his old clothes.

01:27:08.599 --> 01:27:09.808
What shall we do with them?

01:27:09.850 --> 01:27:11.393
Burn them, but first
have them disinfected.

01:27:11.477 --> 01:27:12.394
Wait a minute!

01:27:12.478 --> 01:27:14.355
My party membership book
is in there.

01:27:14.438 --> 01:27:16.607
I'm paid up till December.

01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:30.788
Sitzen machen.

01:27:30.871 --> 01:27:32.039
Hello there.

01:27:32.623 --> 01:27:35.042
Waldemar
von Droste-Schattenburg.

01:27:35.084 --> 01:27:37.878
MacNamara
von Omaha, Nebraska.

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:40.547
Would you mind telling me
why I was summoned here?

01:27:40.631 --> 01:27:42.383
Because every minute
I am away from my post...

01:27:42.424 --> 01:27:44.051
it costs me two marks in tips.

01:27:44.134 --> 01:27:45.135
OK. I'll lay it on the line.

01:27:45.219 --> 01:27:47.054
How would you like
to become a father?

01:27:47.096 --> 01:27:48.097
At my age?

01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:50.015
There's a young man
I'd like you to adopt...

01:27:50.099 --> 01:27:52.685
And the tip is
two thousand marks.

01:27:52.768 --> 01:27:53.686
Good day, sir.

01:27:53.769 --> 01:27:55.020
Hold on there, Count.

01:27:55.104 --> 01:27:56.689
Just because I am reduced...

01:27:56.772 --> 01:27:58.482
to earning
my living in a washroom...

01:27:58.524 --> 01:28:00.192
does not mean that
I'm willing to peddle...

01:28:00.276 --> 01:28:03.028
the honor and dignity
of my family name.

01:28:03.112 --> 01:28:05.823
The von Droste-Schattenburgs
date back to the Second Crusade.

01:28:05.864 --> 01:28:08.117
We have one of the oldest
bloodlines in Europe...

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:09.743
and one of the most inbred.

01:28:09.827 --> 01:28:12.746
I am a direct descendant
of Philip the Bleeder.

01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:14.915
So your proposition
is not only preposterous...

01:28:14.999 --> 01:28:17.710
it is highly insulting.

01:28:17.751 --> 01:28:19.044
Make it ten thousand marks.

01:28:19.086 --> 01:28:20.045
I'll give you three thousand.

01:28:20.087 --> 01:28:21.046
Please. I just told you...

01:28:21.088 --> 01:28:22.548
I come from a long line
of bleeders...

01:28:22.631 --> 01:28:23.549
so don't cut the price.

01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:24.550
Four thousand.

01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:26.218
I will have you know...

01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:29.179
that I am distantly related
to ex-King Farouk of Egypt.

01:28:29.221 --> 01:28:30.180
Thirty-five hundred.

01:28:30.222 --> 01:28:31.140
What happened to four thousand?

01:28:31.223 --> 01:28:33.100
It's a deal.

01:28:33.183 --> 01:28:34.601
Ingeborg, send Piffl in here.

01:28:34.685 --> 01:28:38.814
For an additional 500 marks,
I will include the family crest.

01:28:38.856 --> 01:28:41.525
What is it, two cakes of soap
on a field of paper towels?

01:28:41.608 --> 01:28:44.737
A porcupine rampant
on a field of fleur-de-lis.

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:47.948
You may also have a photograph
of the Schattenburg Castle...

01:28:48.032 --> 01:28:49.908
unfortunately destroyed
during the war.

01:28:49.992 --> 01:28:50.909
American Air Force?

01:28:50.993 --> 01:28:54.204
No. Turkish cavalry. 1683.

01:28:54.705 --> 01:28:56.123
You can't just order me around...

01:28:56.206 --> 01:28:57.833
"Come here, sit there,
do this, eat that!"

01:28:57.875 --> 01:29:00.252
Darling, hold still.
I can't get your cuff link in.

01:29:00.294 --> 01:29:01.879
Is this the lucky young man?

01:29:01.962 --> 01:29:04.173
That's him. Meet your father.

01:29:04.214 --> 01:29:05.174
My father?

01:29:05.215 --> 01:29:06.467
Ah, my dear boy.

01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:08.552
I'm sure you will be
a credit to the family.

01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:10.095
It could use a little credit.

01:29:10.596 --> 01:29:11.555
What is all this?

01:29:11.597 --> 01:29:12.722
You're being adopted.

01:29:12.723 --> 01:29:16.018
Adopted? Just like that,
without even asking me?

01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:18.520
This is not only devious,
it's unilateral.

01:29:18.604 --> 01:29:20.272
My eye. What's the matter
with my eye?

01:29:20.356 --> 01:29:23.108
- This is your daughter-in-law.
- Gnädige Frau.

01:29:23.192 --> 01:29:25.069
Scarlett, I've got
something in my eye!

01:29:25.152 --> 01:29:27.946
It's a monocle.
Looks cute on you.

01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:30.366
A monocle?
How sneaky can you get?

01:29:30.449 --> 01:29:31.825
Go in there
and sign the papers...

01:29:31.867 --> 01:29:34.036
and give this to the cashier
on the way out.

01:29:34.078 --> 01:29:35.037
Thank you.

01:29:35.079 --> 01:29:36.205
What do you think you're doing?

01:29:36.288 --> 01:29:38.415
It's on the house, no charge.

01:29:38.499 --> 01:29:40.292
Good-bye, my son.

01:29:42.544 --> 01:29:44.880
Now, I want you kids to
memorize your new name.

01:29:44.963 --> 01:29:47.800
You are the Count and Countess
von Droste-Schattenburg.

01:29:47.883 --> 01:29:49.051
Count?

01:29:49.134 --> 01:29:51.220
Countess! That means
everybody has to curtsy to me...

01:29:51.261 --> 01:29:52.721
except maybe Grace Kelly.

01:29:52.805 --> 01:29:54.348
Nobody will curtsy to you.

01:29:54.431 --> 01:29:56.183
I refuse to join
the aristocracy.

01:29:56.266 --> 01:29:57.267
They're all leeches...

01:29:57.351 --> 01:29:59.269
bleeding
the underprivileged masses.

01:29:59.353 --> 01:30:00.354
Not the
von Droste-Schattenburgs.

01:30:00.437 --> 01:30:01.355
They bleed themselves.

01:30:01.438 --> 01:30:03.649
Take him into the other room
and get him dressed.

01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:05.025
And now that he's got a name...

01:30:05.109 --> 01:30:06.860
there are some things
I want him to sign.

01:30:06.944 --> 01:30:07.861
What things?

01:30:07.945 --> 01:30:09.196
First, I'm turning over
my limousine...

01:30:09.279 --> 01:30:10.280
and my chauffeur to you.

01:30:10.364 --> 01:30:11.990
All I want is
my motorcycle back.

01:30:12.032 --> 01:30:14.576
Whoever heard of
a countess in a sidecar?

01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:16.036
Besides, where
will we put the baby?

01:30:16.078 --> 01:30:17.496
And have him fill out
these applications...

01:30:17.538 --> 01:30:18.539
Golf club, Diners Club...

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:19.957
Blue Cross,
Book of the Month Club...

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:20.999
Fruit of the Month Club.

01:30:21.041 --> 01:30:22.543
I will sign nothing.
I will join nothing.

01:30:22.626 --> 01:30:25.087
But, darling,
it's the American way of life.

01:30:25.170 --> 01:30:26.672
American way of life.

01:30:26.713 --> 01:30:28.132
Unemployment, discrimination...

01:30:28.215 --> 01:30:30.676
gangsterism,
juvenile delinquency...

01:30:30.717 --> 01:30:32.886
but under
our new twenty-year plan...

01:30:32.928 --> 01:30:34.221
we will catch up with you.

01:30:34.304 --> 01:30:35.722
Lots of luck.

01:30:36.223 --> 01:30:38.100
Ingeborg, get the manager
of the bottling plant...

01:30:38.183 --> 01:30:39.351
up here right away...

01:30:39.435 --> 01:30:41.520
and see if you can find me
a sign painter in a hurry.

01:30:42.563 --> 01:30:44.106
What M.P.s?

01:30:51.697 --> 01:30:53.031
What can I do for you boys?

01:30:53.115 --> 01:30:54.199
Are you the head man
around here?

01:30:54.283 --> 01:30:55.200
That's me.

01:30:55.284 --> 01:30:56.535
We have a report
from one of our G.I.s...

01:30:56.618 --> 01:30:57.661
you've got
a female employee here...

01:30:57.703 --> 01:30:58.662
who's an enemy agent.

01:30:58.704 --> 01:30:59.788
Enemy agent?

01:30:59.872 --> 01:31:01.373
What would you call
a dame that's running around...

01:31:01.415 --> 01:31:03.417
with "Yankee go home"
tattooed on her chest?

01:31:03.542 --> 01:31:04.751
Somebody must be
pulling your leg.

01:31:04.835 --> 01:31:07.379
Maybe and maybe not.
Mind if we look around?

01:31:07.421 --> 01:31:08.380
Be my guest.

01:31:08.422 --> 01:31:11.049
Oh, OK, buster.

01:31:11.133 --> 01:31:12.134
Let's go.

01:31:15.304 --> 01:31:16.263
You sent for me, sir?

01:31:16.346 --> 01:31:17.681
Krause, as manager
of the bottling plant...

01:31:17.723 --> 01:31:19.224
you're always complaining
that you need more help.

01:31:19.308 --> 01:31:20.309
Yes, sir.
We're very busy downstairs.

01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:22.394
Well, cheer up. You're going
to get an assistant.

01:31:22.478 --> 01:31:23.395
- Who?
- You.

01:31:23.479 --> 01:31:24.646
- Me?
- That's right.

01:31:24.688 --> 01:31:26.023
The new manager
of the bottling plant...

01:31:26.106 --> 01:31:27.649
is Otto von Droste-Schattenburg.

01:31:27.691 --> 01:31:28.942
I refuse.

01:31:29.026 --> 01:31:30.402
Your position may be lower,
but your pay will be higher.

01:31:30.486 --> 01:31:31.403
I accept.

01:31:31.487 --> 01:31:32.863
All right.
Into the conference room.

01:31:32.946 --> 01:31:33.864
You've got fifteen minutes...

01:31:33.947 --> 01:31:35.324
to teach this guy
everything you know...

01:31:35.365 --> 01:31:36.325
about the bottling business.

01:31:36.366 --> 01:31:37.659
I can't thank you enough.

01:31:37.701 --> 01:31:38.660
Out.

01:31:38.702 --> 01:31:40.370
Bertha, let me talk
to Mrs. MacNamara.

01:31:40.454 --> 01:31:42.372
What do you mean
she packed up and left?

01:31:42.456 --> 01:31:44.458
Mit die Kinder?
Where did they go?

01:31:44.541 --> 01:31:47.169
Into a taxi.
Thanks a lot.

01:31:48.003 --> 01:31:50.047
Mr. MacNamara, I don't want
to take up your time...

01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:52.049
so if you'll just let me
talk to Miss Hazeltine.

01:31:52.132 --> 01:31:53.050
About what?

01:31:53.133 --> 01:31:55.427
About her marriage to
that Communist in East Berlin.

01:31:55.469 --> 01:31:57.304
I'd like a statement
before we print the story.

01:31:57.387 --> 01:31:59.097
There is no story,
and there's no Communist.

01:31:59.181 --> 01:32:00.349
But we know she got married.

01:32:00.432 --> 01:32:02.851
Sure she did, to Count Otto
von Droste-Schattenburg.

01:32:02.935 --> 01:32:04.144
- Who?
- Otto the Bleeder.

01:32:04.186 --> 01:32:06.355
Goes all the way
back to the Second Crusade...

01:32:06.438 --> 01:32:08.899
a Turkish cavalry.
Here's the family castle.

01:32:08.982 --> 01:32:09.900
Painter.

01:32:09.983 --> 01:32:11.777
Oh, uh...

01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:13.529
come with me.

01:32:16.823 --> 01:32:17.950
Sitzen machen.

01:32:18.033 --> 01:32:20.369
I want you to paint this crest
on the door of a car.

01:32:20.452 --> 01:32:21.870
How long will it take?
That's too long.

01:32:21.954 --> 01:32:24.122
Look, my Mercedes
is parked downstairs.

01:32:25.749 --> 01:32:27.167
Oh, excuse me.

01:32:27.209 --> 01:32:28.418
- Miss Hazeltine?
- Yes?

01:32:28.502 --> 01:32:30.170
How do you spell
your husband's name?

01:32:30.212 --> 01:32:32.256
P-I-f-f-I.

01:32:32.339 --> 01:32:34.800
Piffl? I thought it was
von Droste-Schattenburg.

01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:36.468
Oh, that.
You mustn't believe...

01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:37.970
everything
Mr. MacNamara tells you.

01:32:38.053 --> 01:32:39.638
He fixed it all up...

01:32:39.721 --> 01:32:41.722
so that Daddy wouldn't
find out Otto's a Red.

01:32:41.723 --> 01:32:42.766
Mm-hmm.

01:32:42.849 --> 01:32:44.851
In the beginning,
I didn't like Mr. MacNamara...

01:32:44.935 --> 01:32:46.228
but he's been just marvy.

01:32:46.311 --> 01:32:47.854
That's enough
out of you, Countess.

01:32:47.896 --> 01:32:48.855
Did I say something wrong?

01:32:48.939 --> 01:32:49.982
Buzz off, will you?

01:32:50.023 --> 01:32:51.692
You said there was no story...

01:32:51.733 --> 01:32:53.026
and it's getting
better and better.

01:32:53.068 --> 01:32:55.070
How much do you want
to forget the whole thing?

01:32:55.153 --> 01:32:57.197
You think you can buy
a German newspaperman?

01:32:57.239 --> 01:32:58.407
I never tried before.

01:32:58.490 --> 01:33:00.200
Maybe in America your
journalists are for sale...

01:33:00.284 --> 01:33:01.451
but here in Germany...

01:33:01.535 --> 01:33:05.414
The adoption papers.
All signed and notarized.

01:33:05.497 --> 01:33:07.207
Herr Oberleutnant.

01:33:07.291 --> 01:33:08.208
You two know each other?

01:33:08.292 --> 01:33:09.418
He was my commanding officer.

01:33:09.501 --> 01:33:10.419
In the subway?

01:33:10.502 --> 01:33:11.920
No, after that,
when I was drafted.

01:33:12.004 --> 01:33:12.921
Aha! Gestapo.

01:33:13.005 --> 01:33:14.547
No, no. S.S.

01:33:14.548 --> 01:33:16.466
Halten Sie doch
den Mund, Idiot.

01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:18.051
Well, Herr Oberleutnant...

01:33:18.135 --> 01:33:20.304
is there anything else
I can do for you?

01:33:21.722 --> 01:33:24.099
No, thank you.
I have all the facts.

01:33:24.182 --> 01:33:25.100
Union between two...

01:33:25.183 --> 01:33:26.685
internationally
prominent families...

01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:28.562
The Hazeltines and
the von Droste-Schattenburgs.

01:33:28.645 --> 01:33:29.855
The social event of the year.

01:33:29.938 --> 01:33:31.356
It will be
in the afternoon paper.

01:33:31.398 --> 01:33:32.691
It had better be.

01:33:32.733 --> 01:33:34.693
- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Sieg heil.

01:33:34.735 --> 01:33:35.694
As for you, Schlemmer...

01:33:35.736 --> 01:33:37.529
you're back
in the S.S... smaller salary.

01:33:37.613 --> 01:33:38.697
Sir, let me explain.

01:33:38.739 --> 01:33:41.700
I was only a pastry cook
in the officers' mess.

01:33:41.742 --> 01:33:44.077
Ingeborg, I want to speak
to the maitre d' at the Hilton.

01:33:44.161 --> 01:33:46.538
I was a very bad pastry cook.

01:33:48.373 --> 01:33:49.958
11:00. Where are the hats?

01:33:50.042 --> 01:33:51.293
Where are the flowers?

01:33:51.376 --> 01:33:52.544
We're running behind schedule.

01:33:52.586 --> 01:33:53.712
Yes, sir.

01:33:53.754 --> 01:33:56.006
Manfred, I'd like to arrange
an intimate little banquet...

01:33:56.048 --> 01:33:57.799
The Count and Countess
von Droste-Schattenburg...

01:33:57.883 --> 01:34:00.552
honoring his in-laws,
the Wendell P. Hazeltines.

01:34:01.553 --> 01:34:03.221
Have you got a polka-dot dress?

01:34:03.263 --> 01:34:07.351
Look, Fräulein, haben Sie
eine tattoo on your, um...

01:34:07.434 --> 01:34:08.602
glockenspiel?

01:34:27.287 --> 01:34:28.580
Any broads working
in this office?

01:34:28.622 --> 01:34:29.998
No, sir. Just me.

01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:32.000
- Oh.
- Look, Sarge, polka dots.

01:34:32.042 --> 01:34:33.001
It fits the description.

01:34:33.043 --> 01:34:34.002
Hey, whose dress is that?

01:34:34.044 --> 01:34:35.003
I don't know.

01:34:35.045 --> 01:34:36.171
I never saw it before.

01:34:36.213 --> 01:34:37.214
We'd better check it out.

01:34:41.134 --> 01:34:43.428
Corporal, I'm relieving
myself of duty.

01:34:43.512 --> 01:34:44.888
Better take me back
to the base...

01:34:44.930 --> 01:34:46.347
and turn me in
for psychiatric observation.

01:34:46.348 --> 01:34:47.516
What's the matter, Sarge?

01:34:47.599 --> 01:34:48.975
She's in there, all right.

01:34:49.017 --> 01:34:51.269
I saw her...
Naked as a jaybird.

01:34:51.353 --> 01:34:53.438
Has she got the tattoo
on her chest?

01:34:53.522 --> 01:34:54.981
So what's wrong, Sarge?

01:34:55.023 --> 01:34:57.317
Fellas, you won't
believe this...

01:34:57.359 --> 01:34:59.027
but one of them is yellow.

01:34:59.111 --> 01:35:00.654
One of them is green.

01:35:00.696 --> 01:35:02.614
Take me away!

01:35:09.746 --> 01:35:10.664
Now, for the entree...

01:35:10.747 --> 01:35:12.040
we'll have venison
and hominy grits.

01:35:12.082 --> 01:35:13.875
How do I know
where you get hominy grits?

01:35:13.959 --> 01:35:15.210
Try the Army PX.

01:35:15.293 --> 01:35:17.879
For dessert, peaches flambe
a la Hazeltine.

01:35:17.963 --> 01:35:20.882
WINE: King-size Coca-Cola
in individual ice buckets.

01:35:20.966 --> 01:35:23.218
TABLE DECORATION:
The von Droste-Schattenburg...

01:35:23.301 --> 01:35:24.553
coat of arms
with crossed flags...

01:35:24.594 --> 01:35:25.887
German and Confederate.

01:35:25.971 --> 01:35:28.598
MUSIC: "Dixie," "Swanee River,"
"Waiting for the Robert E. Lee,"

01:35:28.682 --> 01:35:31.393
but not, I repeat not,
"Marching Through Georgia."

01:35:31.476 --> 01:35:34.104
You really want to make me
the boss of the bottling plant?

01:35:34.187 --> 01:35:35.689
It's a must
so your father-in-law...

01:35:35.772 --> 01:35:37.107
won't think you're
just a titled beatnik...

01:35:37.190 --> 01:35:38.108
sponging off your wife.

01:35:38.191 --> 01:35:39.693
I'm going to like this job.

01:35:39.776 --> 01:35:41.194
It's about time you
started to cooperate.

01:35:41.278 --> 01:35:43.530
You know what the first thing
is I'm going to do?

01:35:43.613 --> 01:35:46.533
I'm going to lead the workers
down there in revolt!

01:35:46.575 --> 01:35:48.869
Put you pants on, Spartacus.

01:35:48.952 --> 01:35:50.120
Yeah.

01:35:51.455 --> 01:35:52.539
Ingeborg, call the airport...

01:35:52.622 --> 01:35:55.417
and find out if the 12:00
plane from London is on time.

01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:56.877
Yes, Mr. MacNamara.

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:09.514
Soft drink slaves
of the world arise!

01:36:09.556 --> 01:36:10.682
Smash those bottles...

01:36:10.766 --> 01:36:12.851
pour that syrup
down the sewers...

01:36:12.934 --> 01:36:15.520
- Remember me?
- Commissar Peripetchikoff.

01:36:15.562 --> 01:36:17.063
Well.

01:36:17.147 --> 01:36:18.648
Well is the one thing
I am not.

01:36:18.690 --> 01:36:19.691
You are
a Russian commissar?

01:36:19.775 --> 01:36:22.194
For the last time,
you have made fool of me!

01:36:22.235 --> 01:36:24.029
He fooled me, too.
Listen, Commissar...

01:36:24.112 --> 01:36:26.656
you must help me and my wife
get into the Soviet Zone.

01:36:26.698 --> 01:36:28.033
There may be a little problem.

01:36:28.074 --> 01:36:29.701
Yeah, everybody's
coming this way.

01:36:29.743 --> 01:36:31.411
Fifteen hundred people a day.

01:36:31.495 --> 01:36:32.996
You want to fight
all that traffic?

01:36:33.038 --> 01:36:36.166
I'm a party member,
paid up till December.

01:36:36.208 --> 01:36:37.834
They need me there.
I'm a missile scientist.

01:36:37.876 --> 01:36:41.129
Ah, that is one field
where we're ahead of America.

01:36:41.213 --> 01:36:43.173
In Cape Canaveral,
if missile goes wrong...

01:36:43.215 --> 01:36:45.467
they press
special button and pow!

01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:46.468
It blows up...

01:36:46.551 --> 01:36:48.303
but in Russia,
we have two buttons.

01:36:48.386 --> 01:36:49.304
Two buttons!

01:36:49.387 --> 01:36:52.140
One to blow up missile,
one to blow up scientist.

01:36:52.182 --> 01:36:53.892
What kind of
a commissar are you?

01:36:53.975 --> 01:36:55.185
An ex-commissar.

01:36:55.268 --> 01:36:56.853
You've defected?

01:36:56.895 --> 01:36:59.648
Is old Russian proverb...
Go west, young man.

01:36:59.689 --> 01:37:01.858
What happened to your pals
Mishkin and Borodenko?

01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:03.360
In ambulance on the way
from Brandenburg Gate...

01:37:03.401 --> 01:37:05.362
I snitched Borodenko's
Secret Police badge...

01:37:05.445 --> 01:37:06.530
and had them both arrested.

01:37:06.571 --> 01:37:08.532
You betrayed your own comrades?

01:37:08.615 --> 01:37:11.076
If I don't do it to them,
they do it to me.

01:37:11.159 --> 01:37:13.537
Is old Russian proverb.

01:37:13.578 --> 01:37:14.955
You're worse than he is.

01:37:15.038 --> 01:37:16.456
Look, my young friend.

01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:17.916
I don't want
to be name-dropper...

01:37:17.999 --> 01:37:20.710
but what do you think
Khrushchev did to Malenkov?

01:37:20.794 --> 01:37:22.587
What do you think
Stalin did to Trotsky?

01:37:22.671 --> 01:37:24.714
Is everybody
in this world corrupt?

01:37:24.756 --> 01:37:25.799
I don't know everybody.

01:37:25.882 --> 01:37:28.301
Maybe we should liquidate
the whole human race...

01:37:28.385 --> 01:37:29.886
and start all over again.

01:37:29.970 --> 01:37:31.263
Look at it this way, kid.

01:37:31.346 --> 01:37:33.890
Any world that can
produce the Taj Mahal...

01:37:33.974 --> 01:37:36.059
William Shakespeare,
and striped toothpaste...

01:37:36.142 --> 01:37:37.769
can't be all bad.

01:37:39.396 --> 01:37:41.147
The trousers,
you can try them on.

01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:42.148
Take him with you.

01:37:42.190 --> 01:37:44.109
From now on, I fight alone.

01:37:44.192 --> 01:37:46.945
It's Piffl against
everybody and everything!

01:37:47.028 --> 01:37:48.488
See what I'm up against?

01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:50.407
He can't even
remember his own name.

01:37:50.490 --> 01:37:51.700
To get back to me...

01:37:51.783 --> 01:37:52.742
What do you want... money?

01:37:52.826 --> 01:37:54.828
Certainly not.
I will be rich man now.

01:37:54.953 --> 01:37:56.829
You remember those
twenty carloads of Swiss cheese?

01:37:56.830 --> 01:37:57.830
What about them?

01:37:57.831 --> 01:37:59.165
I have tremendous scheme.

01:37:59.207 --> 01:38:01.543
I will trade them for
twenty carloads of sauerkraut...

01:38:01.585 --> 01:38:03.003
then I will silver-plate
the sauerkraut...

01:38:03.044 --> 01:38:04.921
and sell it
in the United States...

01:38:05.005 --> 01:38:05.922
for Christmas tree decorations.

01:38:06.006 --> 01:38:07.048
You're a cinch.

01:38:07.090 --> 01:38:09.050
But for this, I need
bilingual secretary...

01:38:09.134 --> 01:38:10.719
and you promised me blond lady.

01:38:10.802 --> 01:38:12.095
You came at the right time...

01:38:12.178 --> 01:38:13.930
because I'm moving
to London anyway.

01:38:14.014 --> 01:38:15.056
The only thing is...

01:38:15.098 --> 01:38:16.224
I don't know how to
break the news to her.

01:38:17.309 --> 01:38:18.685
Ingeborg!

01:38:18.727 --> 01:38:21.187
It's not going to be easy.
She's crazy about me.

01:38:21.855 --> 01:38:22.772
Yes, Mr. MacNamara.

01:38:22.856 --> 01:38:25.025
A classified ad
to run in all papers.

01:38:25.108 --> 01:38:28.737
International businessman...
Overweight but cute...

01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:30.864
Needs executive secretary.

01:38:30.906 --> 01:38:33.283
Fringe benefits include
extensive travel...

01:38:33.366 --> 01:38:34.868
large wardrobe allowance...

01:38:34.951 --> 01:38:37.037
liberal retirement plan...

01:38:37.078 --> 01:38:38.038
I take the job.

01:38:38.079 --> 01:38:39.039
You've got it.

01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.041
Good-bye. Good luck.

01:38:41.082 --> 01:38:42.667
And what about that
call to Templehof?

01:38:42.709 --> 01:38:44.628
Oh, the plane will be
ten minutes early.

01:38:44.711 --> 01:38:45.670
10 minutes early?

01:38:45.712 --> 01:38:47.714
That's a hell of a way
to run an airline.

01:38:47.797 --> 01:38:49.716
Planes are supposed
to be late, not early.

01:38:52.052 --> 01:38:55.055
Oh, I never
want to see him again.

01:38:55.138 --> 01:38:56.806
I never want to speak to him.

01:38:57.933 --> 01:38:59.225
I want a divorce.

01:38:59.309 --> 01:39:00.685
What's the matter now?

01:39:00.769 --> 01:39:02.354
He doesn't want the baby.

01:39:02.437 --> 01:39:04.356
He says nobody
should bring children...

01:39:04.439 --> 01:39:05.607
into a world like this.

01:39:05.690 --> 01:39:06.608
That miserable punk.

01:39:06.691 --> 01:39:08.818
Why didn't he think
of that before?

01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:10.362
After all I've gone through.

01:39:10.403 --> 01:39:11.363
Where is he?

01:39:11.404 --> 01:39:13.823
I'm sorry, darling.
I didn't mean it.

01:39:13.865 --> 01:39:16.117
Of course we're going
to have the baby.

01:39:16.201 --> 01:39:17.953
I love you.

01:39:18.036 --> 01:39:20.288
Don't ever scare me
like that again.

01:39:21.289 --> 01:39:24.542
Maybe our children can make this
a better place to live in...

01:39:24.584 --> 01:39:26.920
a world where men
are created equal...

01:39:27.045 --> 01:39:29.798
and there's liberty
and... and justice for all.

01:39:29.881 --> 01:39:30.799
Congratulations.

01:39:30.882 --> 01:39:32.300
You just quoted
Thomas Jefferson...

01:39:32.384 --> 01:39:33.385
Abraham Lincoln...

01:39:33.468 --> 01:39:35.470
and the Pledge of
Allegiance to the Flag.

01:39:35.553 --> 01:39:36.805
I what?

01:39:39.349 --> 01:39:41.518
Come on. Let's get going.

01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:50.360
I take it into the other
room and fix it.

01:39:50.443 --> 01:39:52.028
We haven't got time.
Come with us.

01:39:53.863 --> 01:39:55.490
Schlemmer!

01:39:55.532 --> 01:39:57.117
Sitzen machen.

01:39:59.577 --> 01:40:00.537
Blumen.

01:40:00.578 --> 01:40:03.289
Here. This is
for your mother-in-law.

01:40:16.052 --> 01:40:17.637
Hutte.

01:40:22.434 --> 01:40:25.437
Oh, in front.
You, paint from the inside.

01:40:27.188 --> 01:40:29.315
Quick, to the airport.
Eins, zwei, drei.

01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:40.160
All right!
Watch that umbrella.

01:40:40.201 --> 01:40:41.619
No, I don't like it.

01:40:41.703 --> 01:40:43.705
Here. You need some stuff
for your pockets.

01:40:43.747 --> 01:40:46.791
Money, cigarette case...

01:40:46.875 --> 01:40:49.335
lighter,
picture of the castle.

01:40:49.377 --> 01:40:51.087
Try this one, darling.

01:40:51.171 --> 01:40:53.465
You'd better take
my wristwatch, too.

01:40:55.467 --> 01:40:56.468
Oh, that's my wrist.

01:40:56.551 --> 01:40:57.719
Oh.

01:40:57.802 --> 01:40:59.011
You know, darling,
I don't think...

01:40:59.012 --> 01:41:00.472
you were meant to wear a hat.

01:41:00.555 --> 01:41:03.349
I wasn't meant
to be a count, either.

01:41:03.433 --> 01:41:05.268
This is ridiculous.
Who's going to believe it?

01:41:05.351 --> 01:41:06.269
Calm down.

01:41:06.352 --> 01:41:07.812
The only royalty
we know in America...

01:41:07.854 --> 01:41:11.107
is Nat King Cole,
Duke Snyder, and Earl Wilson.

01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:25.747
- Ouch!
- Oh, pardon.

01:41:29.292 --> 01:41:31.211
Please, Liebchen, not that.
Anything but that.

01:41:31.294 --> 01:41:33.588
All right. Let's see
if we have a black bowler.

01:41:33.671 --> 01:41:34.589
Bowler, bowler.

01:41:34.672 --> 01:41:35.715
Here's a list
of what you owe me.

01:41:35.799 --> 01:41:37.050
- Owe you?
- All itemized.

01:41:37.175 --> 01:41:39.010
MERCEDES LIMOUSINE:
Twenty thousand marks.

01:41:39.052 --> 01:41:40.678
COST OF ADOPTION:
Forty-five hundred marks.

01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:42.806
Suits, haberdashery, shoes,
ET CETERA, ET CETERA:

01:41:42.889 --> 01:41:44.224
12,800 marks.

01:41:44.307 --> 01:41:46.893
Luggage, flowers,
7-COURSE DINNER: 925 marks.

01:41:46.976 --> 01:41:48.686
HAIRCUT AND MANICURE:
Fourteen marks.

01:41:48.728 --> 01:41:50.355
TIPS: Six marks.

01:41:50.396 --> 01:41:51.481
I'm a very large tipper.

01:41:51.523 --> 01:41:54.359
Wristwatch, cigarette case,
LIGHTER WITH FLUID: 2,200 marks.

01:41:54.442 --> 01:41:56.194
LOOSE CHANGE: 475 marks.

01:41:56.277 --> 01:42:00.448
TOTAL: 41,020 marks, or $10,255.

01:42:00.532 --> 01:42:02.534
You mean I have been
a capitalist for three hours...

01:42:02.617 --> 01:42:03.868
and already I owe $10,000?

01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:05.078
That's what makes
our system work.

01:42:05.203 --> 01:42:06.704
Everybody owes everybody.

01:42:06.746 --> 01:42:08.373
That's the one!

01:42:09.207 --> 01:42:11.209
Doesn't it look distinguished?

01:42:11.835 --> 01:42:13.002
Not bad.

01:42:14.045 --> 01:42:16.172
11:46. Faster, Fritz!

01:42:20.802 --> 01:42:22.804
Now, before you meet Daddy,
I'd better warn you...

01:42:22.887 --> 01:42:24.889
There are certain things
he feels very strongly about.

01:42:24.973 --> 01:42:25.890
One is the Civil War.

01:42:25.974 --> 01:42:27.016
Civil War?

01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:29.018
If the subject comes up,
just say it was a draw.

01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:30.019
Another is Coca-Cola.

01:42:30.061 --> 01:42:31.688
Tell him we must
look beyond the six-pack.

01:42:31.729 --> 01:42:33.356
Why not a nine-pack
or a twelve-pack?

01:42:33.439 --> 01:42:34.566
Then there's golf.

01:42:34.649 --> 01:42:36.693
GOLF: The family that plays
together stays together.

01:42:36.734 --> 01:42:38.069
And the world situation...

01:42:38.153 --> 01:42:39.070
It's serious, but not hopeless.

01:42:39.154 --> 01:42:40.530
And vivisection.

01:42:40.572 --> 01:42:41.698
It shouldn't happen to a dog.

01:42:41.739 --> 01:42:43.366
And Red China
and income taxes...

01:42:43.408 --> 01:42:44.701
and Tennessee Williams.

01:42:44.784 --> 01:42:46.786
Wait! Stop the car.
It's no use.

01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:48.079
I can't remember all that.

01:42:48.121 --> 01:42:50.081
Darling, you can't give up now.

01:42:50.123 --> 01:42:51.082
Maybe we'll get lucky.

01:42:51.124 --> 01:42:53.209
Maybe somebody
hijacked the plane.

01:43:07.223 --> 01:43:09.726
Now, honey, you let me
handle this young man.

01:43:09.809 --> 01:43:11.603
It'll take me just
thirty seconds to find out...

01:43:11.686 --> 01:43:13.062
if he's one of those
fortune hunters...

01:43:13.146 --> 01:43:14.480
or some kind of a crackpot.

01:43:14.522 --> 01:43:15.857
Oh, dear. I hope not.

01:43:15.899 --> 01:43:17.483
You don't know these Europeans.

01:43:17.525 --> 01:43:20.028
My poor honey child.

01:43:20.069 --> 01:43:22.280
Where are they anyway?

01:43:38.463 --> 01:43:40.715
Tear them again,
and I'll tear you apart.

01:43:46.763 --> 01:43:48.264
Scarlett!

01:43:56.481 --> 01:43:57.398
Mother!

01:43:57.482 --> 01:43:58.983
Oh, let me look at you.

01:43:59.025 --> 01:44:00.818
Dad. Oh.

01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:02.779
All right. Now, where is he?

01:44:02.862 --> 01:44:04.530
Over here.

01:44:07.283 --> 01:44:08.910
I want you to meet
my husband Otto.

01:44:08.993 --> 01:44:10.453
The Count
von Droste-Schattenburg.

01:44:10.536 --> 01:44:11.454
Count von what?

01:44:11.537 --> 01:44:12.455
This is my mother.

01:44:12.538 --> 01:44:14.749
Your highness.

01:44:14.832 --> 01:44:16.751
Please, not in
the immediate family.

01:44:17.752 --> 01:44:19.712
Oh, one of those... a hand-kisser.

01:44:19.796 --> 01:44:21.047
And this is my father.

01:44:21.130 --> 01:44:22.548
Hello, Dad.
How's your golf?

01:44:22.632 --> 01:44:24.217
I always say, the family
that plays together...

01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:25.385
Never mind that.

01:44:25.468 --> 01:44:27.178
There are a few questions
I want to ask you.

01:44:27.220 --> 01:44:29.222
Don't worry. If it's a boy,
we'll name him after you.

01:44:29.305 --> 01:44:31.182
Wendell P.
Von Droste-Schattenburg.

01:44:31.266 --> 01:44:32.183
Von Droste what?

01:44:32.267 --> 01:44:33.393
We have to be very careful...

01:44:33.476 --> 01:44:34.644
when we change
the baby's diapers.

01:44:34.686 --> 01:44:36.187
Otto comes from
a long line of bleeders.

01:44:36.271 --> 01:44:37.522
Oh, isn't that nice?

01:44:37.605 --> 01:44:39.232
I always wanted
Scarlett to be married...

01:44:39.315 --> 01:44:41.109
to a long line of something.

01:44:41.192 --> 01:44:43.236
Now, MacNamara, tell me
about this young man.

01:44:43.319 --> 01:44:44.696
Who is he,
and what does he do...

01:44:44.779 --> 01:44:46.030
besides slobber
over women's hands?

01:44:46.072 --> 01:44:48.199
Don't let that title fool you.
He works for a living.

01:44:48.283 --> 01:44:49.367
Doing what?

01:44:49.450 --> 01:44:51.536
As a matter of fact,
he's head of our bottling plant.

01:44:51.619 --> 01:44:52.537
He works for us?

01:44:52.620 --> 01:44:54.372
Best man I ever had.
Graduate engineer.

01:44:54.455 --> 01:44:55.373
Took a lot of finagling...

01:44:55.456 --> 01:44:56.874
to get him away
from our competitors.

01:44:56.958 --> 01:44:58.668
You don't say.

01:44:59.419 --> 01:45:01.629
Now, this is a picture
of the family castle.

01:45:02.630 --> 01:45:04.257
And this is my
party membership... oops.

01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:05.258
Wrong party.

01:45:05.341 --> 01:45:07.260
And here's the family crest.

01:45:07.343 --> 01:45:08.845
Oh! Well,
you'll have to put that...

01:45:08.886 --> 01:45:11.389
on all your stationery
and your silverware...

01:45:11.472 --> 01:45:12.390
and your underwear...

01:45:12.473 --> 01:45:14.684
Well, son, glad
to have you on the team.

01:45:14.767 --> 01:45:16.519
I suppose you two met
in the bottling plant.

01:45:16.602 --> 01:45:17.895
Oh, no. We met in a parade.

01:45:17.979 --> 01:45:19.314
He was carrying
a picture of Khrushchev.

01:45:19.355 --> 01:45:20.315
Khrushchev?

01:45:20.356 --> 01:45:22.984
Yes, with a big slogan
on it... "Russki go home!"

01:45:23.026 --> 01:45:24.569
They threw him in jail for it.

01:45:24.652 --> 01:45:25.570
My poor boy.

01:45:25.653 --> 01:45:27.030
How is the situation
here in Berlin?

01:45:27.113 --> 01:45:29.157
It shouldn't happen to a dog.

01:45:29.198 --> 01:45:31.034
I mean it's a draw.

01:45:31.075 --> 01:45:35.038
Actually, the situation
is hopeless but not serious.

01:45:35.121 --> 01:45:36.873
Hopeless but not...

01:45:36.914 --> 01:45:39.375
Say, the boy's got a head
on his shoulders.

01:45:39.459 --> 01:45:40.668
What did I tell you?

01:45:40.710 --> 01:45:43.212
May I have those? Fritz...

01:45:45.006 --> 01:45:46.215
Next. Schlemmer!

01:45:46.299 --> 01:45:48.384
Take these to passport control.
One, two, three.

01:45:48.468 --> 01:45:49.385
Yes, sir.

01:45:49.469 --> 01:45:50.970
Next! Mom, Dad...

01:45:51.054 --> 01:45:52.388
I'm giving a little
banquet tonight...

01:45:52.472 --> 01:45:54.349
Un petit dîner en famille.

01:45:54.432 --> 01:45:55.683
Oh, he speaks French, too.

01:45:55.767 --> 01:45:57.185
- And Russian.
- Russian?

01:45:57.268 --> 01:45:58.269
White Russian, of course.

01:45:58.353 --> 01:45:59.270
Oh.

01:45:59.354 --> 01:46:00.688
Now, Dad, there
are a few ideas...

01:46:00.772 --> 01:46:02.190
I'd like to kick
around with you.

01:46:02.273 --> 01:46:03.816
Now, we must look
beyond the six-pack.

01:46:03.858 --> 01:46:06.527
Why not a nine-pack
or a twelve-pack?

01:46:06.611 --> 01:46:09.155
Pan American Flight 17
to New York...

01:46:09.197 --> 01:46:12.742
via Frankfurt
now boarding at Gate Five.

01:46:21.959 --> 01:46:22.877
Phyllis!

01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:25.338
Mac! You came through 100%.

01:46:25.421 --> 01:46:26.339
I did what I could.

01:46:26.422 --> 01:46:27.548
Now I'm sure I found
the right man...

01:46:27.632 --> 01:46:28.716
for the London job.

01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:29.884
Thanks, Mr. Hazeltine.

01:46:29.967 --> 01:46:31.052
It's just what we need...

01:46:31.135 --> 01:46:32.220
Somebody who's
a good organizer...

01:46:32.303 --> 01:46:33.721
has a lot of drive,
knows the business...

01:46:33.805 --> 01:46:34.722
speaks several languages.

01:46:34.806 --> 01:46:36.182
Well, I studied
every chance I had.

01:46:36.265 --> 01:46:37.350
Yes, sir.

01:46:37.392 --> 01:46:38.643
Absolutely the ideal man
for this position.

01:46:38.684 --> 01:46:41.521
And I'm not just saying that
because he's my son-in-law.

01:46:42.271 --> 01:46:43.189
How's that?

01:46:43.272 --> 01:46:45.233
It's not going to
hurt our prestige any.

01:46:45.316 --> 01:46:46.401
Head of European operations...

01:46:46.484 --> 01:46:48.861
Count Otto
von Droste-Schattenburg.

01:46:48.903 --> 01:46:49.946
Oh, that's how it is.

01:46:50.029 --> 01:46:51.864
As for you, Mac, you
haven't been forgotten.

01:46:51.948 --> 01:46:53.699
You're going all the way
to the top now.

01:46:53.783 --> 01:46:55.201
There's an opening
in the home office...

01:46:55.243 --> 01:46:56.994
vice president in charge
of procurement...

01:46:57.036 --> 01:46:58.037
and it is all yours.

01:46:58.079 --> 01:46:59.372
Why are you so good to me?

01:46:59.497 --> 01:47:01.624
I know you must be dying
to get back to Atlanta.

01:47:01.707 --> 01:47:03.167
Dying is right.

01:47:03.209 --> 01:47:06.087
Here you are, Count.
I won't be needing this anymore.

01:47:06.170 --> 01:47:07.213
Thank you, old chap.

01:47:07.296 --> 01:47:08.214
Bye, Countess.

01:47:08.297 --> 01:47:11.759
Mr. MacNamara,
I simply adore you.

01:47:12.301 --> 01:47:13.386
Will you write to us?

01:47:13.469 --> 01:47:14.470
Better than that.

01:47:14.554 --> 01:47:15.888
I'll send you some
silver-plated sauerkraut...

01:47:15.930 --> 01:47:17.473
for Christmas.

01:47:24.772 --> 01:47:25.857
Mom, can we have a Coke?

01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:28.568
You can have one on the plane.
I don't have any change.

01:47:28.651 --> 01:47:30.528
- I've got change.
- Mac!

01:47:30.611 --> 01:47:32.655
Very nice of you to come
down here to see me off.

01:47:34.866 --> 01:47:35.908
Where are you going?

01:47:35.992 --> 01:47:36.909
Back to the States.

01:47:36.993 --> 01:47:39.328
Funny, that's where we're going.

01:47:39.370 --> 01:47:41.205
I thought I'd take
Flight 17 to New York.

01:47:41.289 --> 01:47:43.124
From there I can hop
a freedom bus to Atlanta.

01:47:43.207 --> 01:47:44.125
- Atlanta?
- Yeah.

01:47:44.208 --> 01:47:47.253
I'm the new vice president
in charge of bottle caps.

01:47:47.336 --> 01:47:49.088
They're kicking me upstairs.

01:47:49.172 --> 01:47:50.715
That's something I've
always wanted to do myself.

01:47:50.798 --> 01:47:52.925
So anytime you and the kids
would care to join me...

01:47:53.009 --> 01:47:54.510
I'll be waiting for you.

01:47:54.552 --> 01:47:56.762
Just a minute. Conference.

01:47:59.682 --> 01:48:01.684
Two out of three. Deal is on.

01:48:01.726 --> 01:48:03.019
Two out of three?

01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:05.521
All right.
Who's the wise guy?

01:48:15.031 --> 01:48:16.699
Schlemmer!
