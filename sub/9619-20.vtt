05:10.059 --> 05:10.601
{\an1}WHEN THE CLIFF PEOPLE

05:10.685 --> 05:11.352
{\an1}TURNED OUT TO BE A FIGMENT

05:11.436 --> 05:13.771
{\an1}OF KTATH'S IMAGINATION?

05:13.855 --> 05:14.063
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY,

05:14.147 --> 05:14.897
{\an1}I HAVEN'T FINISHED IT YET,

05:14.981 --> 05:17.525
{\an1}BUT THANK YOU.

{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, I LOVE

05:18.526 --> 05:19.318
{\an1}ENGLISH LITERATURE.

05:19.402 --> 05:19.819
{\an1}THIS YEAR, WE'RE READING

05:19.902 --> 05:21.487
{\an1}<i>PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.</i>

05:21.571 --> 05:22.238

05:22.322 --> 05:22.655
{\an1}ROMANCE, BETRAYAL,

{\an1}MISTAKEN IDENTITY,

05:23.448 --> 05:25.283
{\an1}FANCY COSTUMES.

05:25.366 --> 05:25.992
{\an1}IT'S LIKE LAST YEAR

05:26.075 --> 05:29.537
{\an1}AT MATH CAMP.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.998
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MAN, I AM PSYCHED FOR SCHOOL.

05:32.081 --> 05:32.623
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU ARE?

05:32.707 --> 05:33.249
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH.

05:33.332 --> 05:33.958
{\an1}I GOT A LITTLE TRICK

05:34.042 --> 05:34.751
{\an1}UP MY SLEEVE.

05:34.834 --> 05:35.460
{\an1}YOU KNOW KELSEY?

05:35.543 --> 05:36.210
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, THE GIRL

05:36.294 --> 05:37.045
{\an1}THAT'S NEVER GONNA GO ON A DATE

05:37.128 --> 05:38.129
{\an1}WITH YOU EVER?

05:38.212 --> 05:38.379
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEP.

05:38.463 --> 05:39.297
{\an1}I'VE GOT A PLAN TO GET HER

05:39.380 --> 05:41.883
{\an1}TO GO ON A DATE WITH ME.

05:41.966 --> 05:43.426
{\an1}IT'S A STANDING BACKFLIP.

05:43.509 --> 05:44.719
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

05:44.802 --> 05:45.720
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T WANNA MAKE

05:45.803 --> 05:46.554
{\an1}A WHOLE THING OF IT,

05:46.637 --> 05:47.263
{\an1}BUT FOR THREE HOURS

05:47.346 --> 05:48.014
{\an1}EVERY MORNING,

05:48.097 --> 05:48.765
{\an1}THIS ENTIRE SUMMER,

05:48.848 --> 05:50.183
{\an1}I'VE BEEN TAKING GYMNASTICS.

05:50.266 --> 05:50.475
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHY?

05:50.558 --> 05:52.894
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BECAUSE TOMORROW MORNING

05:52.977 --> 05:53.352
{\an1}AT SCHOOL,

05:53.436 --> 05:54.145
{\an1}I'M GONNA WALK STRAIGHT

05:54.228 --> 05:55.396
{\an1}UP TO KELSEY, SAY GOOD MORNING

05:55.480 --> 05:57.273
{\an1}AND DO A STANDING BACKFLIP.

05:57.356 --> 05:58.691
{\an1}IT'S A PERFECT PLAN.

05:58.775 --> 05:59.484
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU THINK

05:59.567 --> 06:00.401
{\an1}SHE'S GONNA GO OUT WITH YOU

06:00.485 --> 06:01.277
{\an1}JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN DO

06:01.360 --> 06:02.987
{\an1}A BACKFLIP?

06:03.071 --> 06:05.281
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES, I DO.

06:05.364 --> 06:06.240
{\an1}WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA GET MARRIED

06:06.324 --> 06:08.785
{\an1}BECAUSE OF THIS.

06:08.868 --> 06:09.952
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'M STARTING TO THINK

06:10.036 --> 06:10.620
{\an1}HE LANDED ON HIS HEAD

06:10.703 --> 06:13.331
{\an1}WHILE HE WAS PRACTICING.

06:13.414 --> 06:23.508
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I CAN HEAR YOU.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.134
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AMANDA, ARE YOU OKAY?

06:25.218 --> 06:25.510
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, YES.

06:25.593 --> 06:26.511
{\an1}WHY WOULD YOU THINK OTHERWISE?

06:26.594 --> 06:28.137
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU'RE EATING YOUR SOUP

06:28.221 --> 06:29.388
{\an1}WITH A KNIFE.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.431
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO WONDER I'M STILL HUNGRY

06:30.515 --> 06:33.559
{\an1}AND MY MOUTH IS BLEEDING.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.020
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT'S WRONG?

06:36.104 --> 06:38.022
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MY SISTER

06:38.106 --> 06:39.690
{\an1}IS COMING FOR A VISIT.

06:39.774 --> 06:40.066
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T KNOW

06:40.149 --> 06:41.818
{\an1}YOU HAD A SISTER.

06:41.901 --> 06:42.318
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WE'RE TWINS, ACTUALLY.

06:42.401 --> 06:44.362
{\an1}SHE'S THE MEAN ONE.

06:44.445 --> 06:46.697
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SHE'S THE MEAN ONE?

06:46.781 --> 06:48.407
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU SOUND SURPRISED.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.408
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH, I WAS TRYING

06:49.492 --> 06:50.868
{\an1}REALLY HARD NOT TO.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.453
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SHE'S VERY COMPETITIVE

06:52.537 --> 06:55.373
{\an1}AND SHE HAS A HUGE EGO.

06:55.456 --> 06:55.998
{\an1}SHE JUST CAN'T HANDLE THE FACT

06:56.082 --> 06:56.624
{\an1}THAT I'M SO MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL

06:56.707 --> 06:59.210
{\an1}THAN SHE IS.

06:59.293 --> 06:59.752
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN

06:59.836 --> 07:01.045
{\an1}SINCE YOU'VE SEEN HER?

07:01.129 --> 07:02.004
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, NOT SINCE THE HOLIDAYS.

07:02.088 --> 07:02.463
{\an1}AND EVEN THEN,

07:02.547 --> 07:04.215
{\an1}WE DON'T REALLY SEE EACH OTHER.

07:04.298 --> 07:04.757
{\an1}IF SHE'S IN THE KITCHEN,

07:04.841 --> 07:05.508
{\an1}I'M IN THE LIVING ROOM.

07:05.591 --> 07:06.050
{\an1}IF SHE'S IN THE LIVING ROOM,

07:06.134 --> 07:07.885
{\an1}I'M IN THE DINING ROOM.

07:07.969 --> 07:08.427
{\an1}I'VE GONE UP TO A MONTH

07:08.511 --> 07:09.095
{\an1}IN THE SAME HOUSE

07:09.178 --> 07:10.513
{\an1}WITHOUT EVEN SEEING HER.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.556
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WE HAD THE SAME THING HAPPEN

07:11.639 --> 07:13.266
{\an1}WITH MY UNCLE REGGIE.

07:13.349 --> 07:14.142
{\an1}TURNS OUT HE WAS JUST

07:14.225 --> 07:27.363
{\an1}IN KANSAS CITY BUYING KETCHUP.

07:27.446 --> 07:28.656
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IS IT ME

07:28.739 --> 07:29.574
{\an1}OR DOES EVERYONE LOOK WAY OLDER

07:29.657 --> 07:30.741
{\an1}THAN LAST YEAR?

07:30.825 --> 07:31.159
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I KNOW, RIGHT?

07:31.242 --> 07:31.993
{\an1}AND DID THEY PASS

07:32.076 --> 07:33.077
{\an1}SOME SORT OF LAW THAT EVERY GUY

07:33.161 --> 07:34.537
{\an1}HAS TO COMB THEIR HAIR FORWARD?

07:34.620 --> 07:35.371
{\an1}THERE'S A WHOLE LOTTA ZAC EFRON

{\an1}&gt;&gt; YES.

07:46.674 --> 07:47.675
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU LOOK NICE.

07:47.758 --> 07:48.426

{\an1}OUTFIT.

07:50.928 --> 07:51.888
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T HAVE A HAMPER.

07:51.971 --> 07:54.682
{\an1}WHO AM I, THE MAYOR?

07:54.765 --> 07:55.224
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I WONDER

{\an1}&gt;&gt; LULU, MY DAD SAID

22:54.998 --> 22:55.957
{\an1}UNLESS I GET AN "A" PLUS

22:56.041 --> 22:57.667
{\an1}ON MY EXAM TOMORROW,

22:57.751 --> 22:59.377
{\an1}I HAVE TO QUIT MY JOB.

22:59.461 --> 23:00.545
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOT EVEN.

23:00.629 --> 23:01.671
{\an1}CAN YOU TALK HIM OUT OF IT?

23:01.755 --> 23:02.130
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK SO.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.799
{\an1}HE HAD ON HIS SERIOUS FACE,

23:03.882 --> 23:04.508
{\an1}WORSE THAN THE TIME

23:04.591 --> 23:05.801
{\an1}WHEN MY MOM PICKED HER TEETH

23:05.884 --> 23:06.510
{\an1}WITH HIS HANK AARON

23:06.593 --> 23:08.011
{\an1}BASEBALL CARD.

23:08.095 --> 23:08.762
{\an1}AND HE GOT SO UPSET

23:08.845 --> 23:09.471
{\an1}HE STAYED AT THE HOTEL

23:09.554 --> 23:10.597
{\an1}FOR THREE WHOLE DAYS

23:10.680 --> 23:11.473
{\an1}TILL HE COOLED OFF.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.350
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AFTERNOON, LADIES.

23:13.433 --> 23:15.352
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WOW, WHAT ARE YOU

23:15.435 --> 23:15.727
{\an1}SO HAPPY ABOUT?

23:15.811 --> 23:17.270
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, I JUST FIGURED OUT

23:17.354 --> 23:17.687
{\an1}THE PERFECT NEW PLAN

23:17.771 --> 23:20.690
{\an1}OF WINNING KELSEY'S HEART.

23:20.774 --> 23:21.608
{\an1}I'M GOING TO STUFF MYSELF

23:21.691 --> 23:22.609
{\an1}IN HER LOCKER.

23:22.692 --> 23:24.027
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH BROTHER.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.362
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, IT'LL BE AWESOME.

23:25.445 --> 23:26.571
{\an1}I JAM MYSELF IN HER LOCKER,

23:26.655 --> 23:28.115
{\an1}SHE COMES BY, OPENS THE DOOR

23:28.198 --> 23:29.908
{\an1}AND WHAMO.

23:29.991 --> 23:31.576
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SHE HAS A HEART ATTACK?

23:31.660 --> 23:32.494
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, SHE'S SO CHARMED

23:32.577 --> 23:33.453
{\an1}AND DELIGHTED

23:33.537 --> 23:35.080
{\an1}THAT SHE CAN'T HELP

23:35.163 --> 23:36.414
{\an1}BUT BE MY GIRLFRIEND.

23:36.498 --> 23:39.334
{\an1}MAN, I SHOULD WRITE A BOOK.

23:39.417 --> 23:43.130
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU SHOULD READ A BOOK.

23:43.213 --> 23:43.797
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HA HA HA.

23:43.880 --> 23:44.798
{\an1}OH, YOU CAN'T EVEN HURT

23:44.881 --> 23:45.465
{\an1}MY FEELINGS.

23:45.549 --> 23:46.716
{\an1}GO AHEAD, TRY AGAIN.

23:46.800 --> 23:47.342
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU LOOK LIKE YOU WASHED

23:47.425 --> 23:51.304
{\an1}YOUR HAIR WITH DISHWATER.

23:51.388 --> 24:03.150
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OKAY, THAT ONE HURT.

24:03.233 --> 24:05.110
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BONJOUR.

24:05.193 --> 24:06.736
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SOPHIE,

24:06.820 --> 24:07.237
{\an1}WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24:07.320 --> 24:08.071
{\an1}SHOULDN'T YOU BE WORKING

24:08.155 --> 24:09.114
{\an1}ON YOUR WINDOW DISPLAY?

24:09.197 --> 24:10.532
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I RAN OUT OF RED PAINT.

24:10.615 --> 24:11.908
{\an1}&gt;&gt; AND YOU CAME HERE FOR MORE?

24:11.992 --> 24:12.868
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.327
{\an1}IT REMINDED ME OF THE TIME

24:14.411 --> 24:14.911
{\an1}THAT WE RENTED

24:14.995 --> 24:16.413
{\an1}THOSE RED BICYCLES

24:16.496 --> 24:17.455
{\an1}AND SPENT THE DAY

24:17.539 --> 24:20.584
{\an1}IN LE RIVE DU CHAPEAUX.

24:20.667 --> 24:21.710
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT A PLACE.

24:21.793 --> 24:23.920
{\an1}IT MEANS THE RIVER OF HATS.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.130
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THOSE WERE

24:25.213 --> 24:27.549
{\an1}SOME PRETTY MAGICAL TIMES.

24:27.632 --> 24:29.509
{\an1}DO YOU MISS THEM, MAX?

24:29.593 --> 24:33.305
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO.

24:54.492 --> 24:57.871
{\an1}I HOPE YOU FIND YOUR RED PAINT.

24:57.954 --> 24:59.831

{\an1}&gt;&gt; DORIS.

25:23.355 --> 25:23.772
{\an1}&gt;&gt; CAN I ASK YOUR ADVICE?

25:23.855 --> 25:25.398
{\an1}&gt;&gt; CERTAINLY.

25:25.482 --> 25:26.024
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'M SORT OF FREAKING OUT

25:26.107 --> 25:26.399
{\an1}BECAUSE MIKEY J

25:26.483 --> 25:27.359
{\an1}GOT INTO THE GIFTED PROGRAM

25:27.442 --> 25:27.609
{\an1}AT SCHOOL.

{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHO'S MIKEY J?

25:29.986 --> 25:30.570
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MY BOYFRIEND.

{\an1}YOU'VE MET HIM

25:31.238 --> 25:33.114
{\an1}LIKE A BILLION TIMES.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.033
{\an1}ANYWAY, I THINK

25:35.116 --> 25:35.742
{\an1}I'M PROBABLY ELIGIBLE

25:35.825 --> 25:36.785
{\an1}FOR THE GIFTED PROGRAM, TOO,

25:36.868 --> 25:38.119
{\an1}SINCE I'M A SUPER MATH GENIUS

25:38.203 --> 25:38.578
{\an1}BUT THAT WOULD MEAN

25:38.662 --> 25:39.496
{\an1}LEAVING TRUE.

25:39.579 --> 25:41.373
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHO'S TRUE?

25:41.456 --> 25:42.207
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU MEAN, LIKE, WHO IS SHE

25:42.290 --> 25:43.333
{\an1}COMPARED TO BEING WITH MIKEY J

25:43.416 --> 25:43.959
{\an1}OR COMPARED TO GETTING

25:44.042 --> 25:45.543
{\an1}THE BEST EDUCATION I CAN?

25:45.627 --> 25:45.961

25:46.044 --> 25:47.545
{\an1}LIKE A REALLY SMART GIRL.

25:48.672 --> 25:51.508
{\an1}WILL BE THE RIGHT DECISION.

25:51.591 --> 25:53.593
{\an1}COOKIE?

25:53.677 --> 25:55.720
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ARE YOU OKAY?

25:55.804 --> 25:58.056
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OF COURSE I'M OKAY.

25:58.139 --> 25:59.975
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WOW, THANKS FOR THE ADVICE.

26:00.058 --> 26:01.268
{\an1}I HAVE A LOT TO THINK ABOUT.

26:01.351 --> 26:03.812
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.

26:03.895 --> 26:08.566
{\an1}WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

26:08.650 --> 26:09.985
{\an1}OSCAR, I'M GONNA GO OUT

26:15.490 --> 26:20.537
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THE COAST IS CLEAR.

26:20.620 --> 26:20.870
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

26:20.954 --> 26:22.038
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW

26:22.122 --> 26:23.081
{\an1}WHY YOU'RE AVOIDING HER.

26:23.164 --> 26:25.125
{\an1}SHE'S SO NICE.

26:25.208 --> 26:26.960
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH, I GET IT.

26:27.043 --> 26:28.795
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

26:28.878 --> 26:30.338
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MY ENTIRE LIFE,

26:30.422 --> 26:32.090
{\an1}NO MATTER WHAT I ACCOMPLISHED,

26:32.173 --> 26:33.883
{\an1}LISA MARIE DID ME ONE BETTER.

26:33.967 --> 26:34.301
{\an1}IF I WON A RIBBON,

26:34.384 --> 26:35.510
{\an1}SHE WON A TROPHY.

26:35.593 --> 26:35.969
{\an1}IF I GOT A GOOD JOB,

26:36.052 --> 26:37.846
{\an1}SHE GOT A GREAT JOB.

26:37.929 --> 26:38.221
{\an1}IF I BOUGHT A CAR,

26:38.305 --> 26:38.930
{\an1}SHE GOT TO RIDE

26:39.014 --> 26:39.973
{\an1}IN THE SPACE SHUTTLE.

26:40.056 --> 26:40.515
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HYPOTHETICALLY.

26:40.598 --> 26:42.392
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, THAT REALLY HAPPENED.

26:42.475 --> 26:42.892
{\an1}THEN THEY GOT MAROONED

26:42.976 --> 26:43.852
{\an1}AND SHE FIXED THE ROCKET BOOSTER

26:43.935 --> 26:44.561
{\an1}WITH SOME CANDY WRAPPERS

26:44.644 --> 26:47.731
{\an1}AND A BARRETTE.

26:47.814 --> 26:50.358
{\an1}MY GOSH, THIS IS

26:50.442 --> 26:51.359
{\an1}THE MOST DELICIOUS COOKIE

26:51.443 --> 26:52.819
{\an1}I'VE EVER TASTED.

26:52.902 --> 26:53.945
{\an1}WHERE ARE THESE FROM?

26:54.029 --> 26:54.738
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LISA MARIE MADE THEM.

26:54.821 --> 27:00.660
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OF COURSE SHE DID.

27:00.744 --> 27:05.582
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LITTLE HELP.

27:05.665 --> 27:07.083
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:07.167 --> 27:08.460
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M DOING?

27:08.543 --> 27:09.377
{\an1}PRACTICING GETTING STUCK

27:09.461 --> 27:09.919
{\an1}IN A SMALL PLACE

27:10.003 --> 27:10.337
{\an1}SO KELSEY WILL SEE

27:10.420 --> 27:11.629
{\an1}THAT I'M SERIOUS

27:11.713 --> 27:13.590
{\an1}ABOUT US BEING TOGETHER.

27:13.673 --> 27:14.716

27:14.799 --> 27:17.802

{\an1}&gt;&gt; I THINK YOUR BRAIN'S ASLEEP.

27:18.762 --> 27:19.763
{\an1}&gt;&gt; POSSIBLY.

27:19.846 --> 27:21.181
{\an1}I'VE BEEN IN HERE

27:21.264 --> 27:21.556
{\an1}FOR EIGHT HOURS.

27:21.639 --> 27:23.475

{\an1}AT THIS EXACT WINDOW

27:33.151 --> 27:35.445
{\an1}WHEN WE WERE KIDS?

27:35.528 --> 27:41.368
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WE TOTALLY DID.

27:41.451 --> 27:43.745
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOT BAD. NOT BAD AT ALL.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.080
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU LIKE FASHION, RYAN?

27:45.163 --> 27:45.914
{\an1}&gt;&gt; FASHION?

{\an1}NO, I'M LOOKING

{\an1}WE'RE SOUL MATES.

28:36.631 --> 28:38.633
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DID SOMEBODY SAY SOUL MATES?

28:38.716 --> 28:39.426
{\an1}YOU WEREN'T TALKING

{\an1}THE DAY HE CRAWLED

28:59.279 --> 29:00.405
{\an1}OUT OF THE DESERT.

29:00.488 --> 29:01.573
{\an1}MR. MADIGAN'S NOT LEAVING

29:01.656 --> 29:01.823
{\an1}HIS WIFE.

29:01.906 --> 29:04.826
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, I'M SORRY, BUT YES HE IS.

29:04.909 --> 29:06.744
{\an1}AND TRUST ME,

29:06.828 --> 29:10.582
{\an1}WHEN I'M RUNNING MAD STYLE,

29:10.665 --> 29:14.711
{\an1}THERE'LL BE SOME CHANGES.

29:14.794 --> 29:16.004
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT,

29:16.087 --> 29:17.755
{\an1}I DON'T LIKE HER.

29:17.839 --> 29:18.840
{\an1}&gt;&gt; JUST IGNORE HER.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.258
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HEY, CHECK IT OUT, TRUE.

29:20.341 --> 29:20.925
{\an1}I BET YOU COULD USE THIS THING

29:21.009 --> 29:22.510
{\an1}LIKE A ZIP LINE.

29:22.594 --> 29:23.887
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT'S A ZIP LINE?

29:23.970 --> 29:33.855
{\an1}&gt;&gt; TOO FAST.

29:33.938 --> 29:38.860
{\an1}I CAN FIX THAT.

29:38.943 --> 29:42.030
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MS. GIRARD, ARE YOU OKAY?

29:42.113 --> 29:43.907
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OF COURSE I'M OKAY.

29:43.990 --> 29:44.741
{\an1}IS SOMEBODY TURNING THE LIGHTS

29:44.824 --> 29:46.367
{\an1}ON AND OFF?

29:46.451 --> 29:46.784
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S EXACTLY

29:46.868 --> 29:48.828
{\an1}WHAT MY UNCLE REGGIE SAID

29:48.912 --> 30:01.049
{\an1}RIGHT BEFORE HE PASSED OUT.

30:01.132 --> 30:01.257
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO.

30:01.341 --> 30:02.175

30:04.719 --> 30:05.553
{\an1}IN THE HALLWAY?

30:05.637 --> 30:07.805
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH NO, JUST MY TWIN SISTER.

30:07.889 --> 30:08.556
{\an1}I'VE BEEN AVOIDING HER

30:08.640 --> 30:09.474
{\an1}FOR TWO DAYS.

30:09.557 --> 30:09.849
{\an1}SHE'S A MONSTER.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.184
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IS SHE THE ONE

30:11.267 --> 30:11.601
{\an1}WHO FILLED MY OFFICE

30:11.684 --> 30:12.852

30:22.070 --> 30:22.820
{\an1}BY THE TIPPY-TOP

30:22.904 --> 30:23.821

30:23.905 --> 30:28.660

30:28.743 --> 30:29.494
{\an1}KOPELMAN, YOU THINK

30:29.577 --> 30:32.539
{\an1}THIS IS FUNNY?

30:38.962 --> 30:40.338
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IS SHE GOING TO BE OKAY?

30:40.421 --> 30:41.464
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SHE IS,

30:41.548 --> 30:42.131
{\an1}BUT SHE WILL NOT BE ABLE

30:42.215 --> 30:43.049
{\an1}TO COMPLETE HER WINDOW,

30:43.132 --> 30:43.591
{\an1}SO WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN HERS

30:43.675 --> 30:44.676
{\an1}AS WELL.

30:44.759 --> 30:45.677
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S GREAT.

30:45.760 --> 30:46.219
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I KNOW.

30:46.302 --> 30:47.178
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF WORK.

30:47.262 --> 30:48.179
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I KNOW.

30:48.263 --> 30:49.305
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NO, I MEAN IN A BAD WAY.

{\an1}TO BE DEMOLISHING THE WALL

30:58.690 --> 30:59.607
{\an1}IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE

30:59.691 --> 31:00.191
{\an1}A GIANT REPORT

31:16.749 --> 31:18.543
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHY IS SORRY IN QUOTES?

31:18.626 --> 31:23.006
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BECAUSE I'M NOT REALLY.

{\an1}A TURNING POINT IN THE WAR,

32:19.062 --> 32:19.687
{\an1}IT WAS THE START

35:25.832 --> 35:32.129
{\an1}YOU EVER SEE ME.

35:32.213 --> 35:35.424
{\an1}THAT WAS A CLOSET.

35:35.508 --> 35:35.758
{\an1}BUT THIS TIME,

35:53.734 --> 35:55.903

35:55.987 --> 35:56.404
{\an1}HOWEVER, IN THE FUTURE,

35:56.487 --> 35:57.446
{\an1}IF YOU GUYS

{\an1}WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

41:22.855 --> 41:25.274
{\an1}I WANTED TO BE AN ASTRONAUT,

41:25.357 --> 41:25.482

{\an1}"YOU AIN'T GONNA LIKE IT.

41:36.660 --> 41:37.995
{\an1}&gt;&gt; GRANDPA SOUNDS

41:38.078 --> 41:39.747
