Vic's name is Dr. Ellis Mason.

worked in Honolulu.

fleeing the scene.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.475
And when unis
pulled over your friend,

07:55.518 --> 07:56.911
he seemed extremely nervous,

07:56.954 --> 07:58.478
so we brought him in
for questioning.

07:58.521 --> 07:59.740
That sounds pretty
circumstantial.

07:59.783 --> 08:01.350
Damn right it does.

You test him
for gunshot residue?

Uh, GSR results
were inconclusive, but...

08:05.267 --> 08:08.009
we did find blood
on his shoes.

08:08.052 --> 08:10.620
Did Hani say what he was doing
in the parking garage?

08:10.664 --> 08:13.754
He claims he was a patient and
Mason said to meet him there.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.756
But he's not
on Mason's patient roster.

08:15.799 --> 08:17.192
Also,

08:17.235 --> 08:20.108

08:20.151 --> 08:21.979
contained supplies of PEDs.

08:24.025 --> 08:25.548
Steroids.
So, Mason

08:25.592 --> 08:27.550
was doing some dealing
on the side.

08:27.594 --> 08:30.161
You tell me.
Any reason

08:30.205 --> 08:32.294
for your friend might be
interested in PEDs?

08:33.687 --> 08:35.950
No. Hell no.

08:35.993 --> 08:38.169
No way do I believe Hani
is juicing his son.

08:38.213 --> 08:39.867
I-I didn't say that.Yeah, but you
were thinking it.

08:39.910 --> 08:42.609
What makes you so sure
Hani didn't kill this guy?

08:42.652 --> 08:44.741
'Cause I know him.
It's not in his nature.

08:44.785 --> 08:46.177
Remember that story
you told Rick and me

08:46.221 --> 08:47.788
about when you were a kid,

08:47.831 --> 08:50.399
your father got picked up on
suspicion of bank robbery?

08:50.442 --> 08:51.661
The charges were dropped.

08:51.705 --> 08:53.228
That's exactly my point.
Maybe you're projecting

08:53.271 --> 08:54.621
your father's innocence on a man

08:54.664 --> 08:56.492
that-that you don't know

Don't strain yourself

Look, one thing has nothing
to do with the other.

09:00.409 --> 09:02.585
I know Hani enough to know that
he would never do something

09:02.629 --> 09:03.934
to risk losing his son.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.762
Yeah, well, I'd have to hear
that from Hani himself

09:05.806 --> 09:07.198
and Katsumoto is not gonna
let anybody talk to him

09:07.242 --> 09:09.200
except for his lawyer.Okay.

09:09.244 --> 09:12.203
Let's find a lawyer to
help sneak you inside.

when I got there.

10:54.392 --> 10:56.003
Why didn't you call the police?

10:56.046 --> 10:58.614
I don't know.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.965
I panicked.
I wasn't thinking clearly.

11:02.009 --> 11:04.098
[phone chimes]Wow.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.971
If you were
Mason's patient,

11:08.015 --> 11:10.757
why would you meet
in a parking garage?

11:10.800 --> 11:14.499
It was his idea.
He was treating me off-book.

11:14.543 --> 11:16.240
I couldn't afford
his usual fees,

11:16.284 --> 11:18.460
and insurance wouldn't cover it.

11:18.503 --> 11:20.331
Treating you for what, exactly?

11:20.375 --> 11:22.551
Just general things.

11:22.594 --> 11:23.900
General things.
So it had nothing to do

11:23.944 --> 11:25.946
with the PEDs in his trunk?

11:25.989 --> 11:28.383
Performance-enhancing
drugs? T-The steroids?

11:28.426 --> 11:30.428
I don't know anything
about that.

11:30.472 --> 11:32.343
Did they tell you
about the threats?

11:32.387 --> 11:33.649
What threats?

11:33.693 --> 11:35.869
Dr. Mason was being threatened
by someone.

11:35.912 --> 11:37.958
A-Another patient, I think.

11:38.001 --> 11:40.525
And how would you know that?

11:40.569 --> 11:43.659
Because he confided it to me,
more than a week ago.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.966
I told
the arresting officers,

11:46.009 --> 11:48.098
but because I didn't have
a name, they ignored me.

11:48.142 --> 11:50.013
Or they didn't believe you.

11:50.057 --> 11:52.320
Was the parking garage

11:52.363 --> 11:54.539
the only place that you
and Mason would meet up?

11:54.583 --> 11:56.716
Uh, couple times, uh,

11:56.759 --> 11:59.327
he had me meet him downtown,
at a gym.

11:59.370 --> 12:00.720
What gym?

12:02.896 --> 12:05.289
I don't know if you noticed,

12:05.333 --> 12:08.553
but your boy in there
wasn't being entirely honest.

12:08.597 --> 12:10.642
I thought you weren't listening.

12:10.686 --> 12:12.993
I read body language fluently.

12:13.036 --> 12:16.431
He's gonna need
a really good defense.

12:16.474 --> 12:19.564
Make sure you give him
my card, doll.

12:19.608 --> 12:21.784
MAGNUM:
Vanessa was right.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.655
Hani was holding back
something.

12:23.699 --> 12:26.354
But if he was right about
someone threatening Dr. Mason,

12:26.397 --> 12:29.052
then the boxing gym seemed
like a good place to start.

12:29.096 --> 12:31.576
But first I had to find someone

12:31.620 --> 12:33.187
to look after Mak.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.666
It's out of the question.

12:34.710 --> 12:37.582
It's just until TC and I
get Mak's dad out of trouble.

12:37.626 --> 12:40.324
Look, I appreciate
the enormity of the situation,

12:40.368 --> 12:41.761
and I-I feel for the child.

12:41.804 --> 12:42.805
His name's Mak.

12:42.849 --> 12:43.937
Mak.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.939
But I have a lot
of work to do here

12:45.982 --> 12:47.592
and no time to babysit.

12:47.636 --> 12:48.942
And besides, what would
I even do with him?

12:48.985 --> 12:51.248
You could feed him.

12:51.292 --> 12:53.642
My nephew was always starved

12:53.685 --> 12:57.167
when he was Makoa's age.

12:58.603 --> 13:01.606
Right, then.

13:02.869 --> 13:05.610
Come along, Mak.
Let's get you fed.

13:09.571 --> 13:10.833
Do you like duck?

13:10.877 --> 13:13.357
I think we have some left
in the refrigerator.

13:13.401 --> 13:16.360
No worries. I'll make him
a grilled cheese sandwich.

He said, uh,

13:40.907 --> 13:42.996
Mason used to come in here
from time to time.

13:43.039 --> 13:45.868
In fact, just last week,
he got into an altercation

13:45.912 --> 13:49.393
with... that beast,

13:49.437 --> 13:52.614
Wade Steuben.
He's an MMA fighter.

13:52.657 --> 13:54.224
All right, let's go talk to him.

13:54.268 --> 13:55.922
Wait, h-hold on.
On that note,

13:55.965 --> 13:58.838
in order to get that information
out of the guy, I had to...

13:58.881 --> 14:02.102
offer up a sparring partner
for his boy.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.886
Who, me?

14:03.930 --> 14:05.888
You offered up me?

14:07.411 --> 14:08.978
All right, man, who's his boy?

14:09.022 --> 14:11.720
That guy.
Nah.

14:11.763 --> 14:13.113
This dude?

14:13.156 --> 14:15.724
He looks kind of vicious.

14:15.767 --> 14:18.205
Relax, you got 30 pounds
and a four-inch reach advantage

14:18.248 --> 14:19.597
on the guy. You'll be fine.

14:22.687 --> 14:24.428
Yeah, stay away from his left.

14:25.734 --> 14:26.909
And his right.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.738
Hey, look,
just bob and weave, man.

14:29.781 --> 14:31.566
Get a couple minutes in there.

14:31.609 --> 14:34.569
I'll go talk to Steuben,
we'll get out of here.

14:34.612 --> 14:35.787
Have some fun.

14:37.224 --> 14:39.226
I'm-a kill you for this.

14:39.269 --> 14:41.445
[grunting]

14:41.489 --> 14:44.927
Wade Steuben. Big fan.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.668
[sniffles]

14:46.711 --> 14:49.758
That was some
fight last week.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.064
I haven't had a fight in months.

14:51.107 --> 14:52.848
No, I'm talking about
the one you had here,

14:52.892 --> 14:55.720
with your steroid supplier.
Your little run-in?

14:55.764 --> 14:58.158
Look, I-I'm trying to get

14:58.201 --> 14:59.942
a little something-something
for my fighter up here.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.639
What do you think?

15:03.598 --> 15:05.817
[gasping, coughing]

15:05.861 --> 15:07.776
I wouldn't waste your time.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.299
Why is that?

15:09.343 --> 15:12.433
That jerk sold me a masking
agent to pass drug tests.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.000
I failed twice.

15:14.043 --> 15:15.653
It cost me
a two-year suspension,

15:15.697 --> 15:18.482
three endorsements
and the title shot.

15:27.622 --> 15:28.623
Hey, I'll be right back.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.320
Huh?

15:34.107 --> 15:36.936
Two-year suspension--

15:36.979 --> 15:39.112
sounds like a pretty good reason
to kill a guy.

15:39.895 --> 15:41.418
What, you didn't hear?

15:41.462 --> 15:43.638
Ellis Mason was
shot two days ago.

15:43.681 --> 15:45.422
What are you, a cop?

15:45.466 --> 15:46.902
Eh, private investigator.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.296
Then no one will mind too much
if I kick your head in.

15:49.339 --> 15:50.688
I'll mind.

15:57.913 --> 15:59.393
TC, got to go!

15:59.436 --> 16:00.655
[grunts]

16:01.917 --> 16:04.876
Good fight.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.661
[phone rings]

16:06.704 --> 16:07.923
Katsumoto.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.751
It's Magnum.

16:09.794 --> 16:11.622
You seriously need to look
into a guy named Wade Steuben,

16:11.666 --> 16:12.797
an MMA fighter.

16:12.841 --> 16:14.538
Magnum...I'm pretty sure he's the one

16:14.582 --> 16:16.236
Hani said was
threatening Ellis Mason.

16:16.279 --> 16:19.195
Look, he's got motive
and a temper.

16:19.239 --> 16:21.371
I've got something better--
murder weapon.

16:21.415 --> 16:23.852
Heckler & Koch 9mm.Where?

16:23.895 --> 16:25.462
That's the best part.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.464
We have security footage of it
being tossed into a dumpster

16:27.508 --> 16:29.031
a half mile
from the murder scene.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.859
Three guesses
who did the tossing.

16:30.902 --> 16:33.470
All right.

16:33.514 --> 16:35.342
He's being transferred
to Oahu Correctional.

16:35.385 --> 16:37.822
Prosecutor's officially charged
him with murder one.

16:37.866 --> 16:39.520
Let's go.

17:00.845 --> 17:02.847
You're thinking
about your father.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.156
I'm scared I won't
see him again.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.854
Of course you will.

17:11.160 --> 17:14.337
You'll come to discover
that Mr. Magnum...

17:14.381 --> 17:16.992
generally succeeds
in what he sets out to do.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.863
How come?

17:22.171 --> 17:25.087
You remember
what this piece is called?

17:25.131 --> 17:27.089
The knight?Mm-hmm.

17:27.133 --> 17:31.050
This particular one
happens to be

17:31.093 --> 17:33.226
the white knight.

17:33.269 --> 17:35.880
And players
often underestimate it,

17:35.924 --> 17:38.927
because it's unassuming.

17:38.970 --> 17:41.321
Its moves seem

17:41.364 --> 17:43.497
almost erratic,

17:43.540 --> 17:46.978
unpredictable.

17:47.022 --> 17:49.372
But quite often,

17:49.416 --> 17:53.028
it will surprise you.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.684
You could almost argue it's the
most important piece in chess.

17:58.207 --> 18:01.036
Next to the queen, of course.

18:02.472 --> 18:06.128
But the knight
won't let you down.

18:07.956 --> 18:10.524
What do you mean I'm letting
you down? Hani lied to me.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.439
He must've had good reason.

18:12.482 --> 18:13.614
Just because we're down
at the half

18:13.657 --> 18:14.876
don't mean the game is over.

18:14.919 --> 18:16.443
No, this isn't halftime.

18:16.486 --> 18:19.663
This is sudden death, and we're
on our own two-yard line.

18:19.707 --> 18:21.100
He had the gun.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.058
There must have been
some good explanation for that.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.451
Well, we're not gonna know
what it is

18:24.494 --> 18:26.017
until they're finished
processing him.

18:26.061 --> 18:29.151
Look, you have to consider
the possibility

18:29.195 --> 18:30.761
that Hani is guilty.

18:30.805 --> 18:31.936
Look, Wade Steuben
is the killer.

18:31.980 --> 18:33.938
I know it in my bones.

18:33.982 --> 18:35.984
And so do you.

18:37.594 --> 18:39.292
MAGNUM:
Maybe TC was right.

18:39.335 --> 18:41.555
But someone with Steuben's
temper and penchant

18:41.598 --> 18:44.688
for violence wouldn't have
needed a gun to kill Mason.

18:44.732 --> 18:47.996
Maybe we were
missing something.

18:48.039 --> 18:50.129
There she is.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.174
[sighs]
Not now, Magnum. I'm slammed.

18:52.218 --> 18:53.958
More like slammin'.

18:54.002 --> 18:57.179
Hey, I, uh, got
a present for you.

18:58.485 --> 19:01.009
You got that from the vending
machine outside in the hall.

19:01.052 --> 19:02.663
You know,
the quality of your bribes

19:02.706 --> 19:04.186
has taken
a serious nosedive.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.449
Must not be that important
of a favor.

19:06.493 --> 19:08.625
No, it's important.

19:08.669 --> 19:11.106
I just didn't have time to stop
and get something better.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.281
[sighs]

19:15.328 --> 19:17.678
So what do you need?

19:17.721 --> 19:19.723
You know the autopsy
on Dr. Mason?

19:19.767 --> 19:23.162
Was there any bruising
or contusions indicating

19:23.205 --> 19:25.338
a struggle with somebody
really strong?

19:26.600 --> 19:28.558
I did notice some bruising,

19:28.602 --> 19:30.560
but I haven't done
the full workup yet.

19:30.604 --> 19:32.214
I can't give you
anything conclusive

19:32.258 --> 19:34.216
until I start the autopsy.

19:34.260 --> 19:35.783
Can you let me know
as soon as you do?

19:35.826 --> 19:37.611
There could be another bag
of stale chips in it for you.

19:37.654 --> 19:39.090
[sighs]
Fine.

19:39.134 --> 19:41.571
The sooner you leave,
the sooner I can get started.

19:41.615 --> 19:43.921
Thank you.

19:43.965 --> 19:45.096
Don't touch it, Magnum.

19:45.140 --> 19:46.707
I wasn't.

19:46.750 --> 19:49.144
I didn't really need
to pick it up, anyway.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.146
I recognized the crest
on the valet ticket.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.193
The Lunalilo Palace
Hotel and Condos.

19:58.022 --> 19:59.894
Pardon me.Oh, I'm so sorry.

19:59.937 --> 20:02.201
My daughter was told
that she'd be able

20:02.244 --> 20:04.333
to pick up her husband's
wedding ring here.

20:04.377 --> 20:06.030
You're Mrs. Mason.

20:06.074 --> 20:07.858
Yes. This is my mother, Ruth.

20:07.902 --> 20:09.251
I-I'm Thomas Magnum.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.645
I'm investigating
Dr. Mason's murder.

20:11.688 --> 20:14.169
I'm very sorry for your loss.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.781
Thank you.We appreciate what you
and the other officers did,

20:17.825 --> 20:19.783
capturing
the man responsible.

20:19.827 --> 20:21.045
Oh, uh...These past two days

20:21.089 --> 20:22.699
have been so awful.

20:22.743 --> 20:25.702
At least now Brooke
can fly home to Kauai

20:25.746 --> 20:28.227
with some small sense
of closure.

20:29.619 --> 20:31.621
You're welcome.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.668
[sniffles]

20:38.280 --> 20:41.283
I don't know what made me
feel worse-- their grief

20:41.327 --> 20:44.243
or that I was working
to undo their closure.

20:45.896 --> 20:48.769
The Lunalilo's night manager
was an old client of mine.

20:48.812 --> 20:52.207
He confirmed that Mason rented
a condo there during the week.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.166
Saved him from the commute
back and forth to Kauai.

20:55.210 --> 20:57.908
[beep] A 50 from TC was enough

20:57.952 --> 21:00.389
to get us a keycard
into the place.

21:05.046 --> 21:06.656
Who still uses
these fossils anymore?

21:06.700 --> 21:08.876
People afraid
of their

21:08.919 --> 21:10.747
voice mails
getting hacked.

21:10.791 --> 21:12.140
WOMAN:
It's me. Meeting's running late.

21:12.183 --> 21:13.707

32:31.297 --> 32:32.776
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

32:32.820 --> 32:34.213
Don't hobble off.

32:35.779 --> 32:37.085
DISPATCHER:
911 emergency.

32:37.129 --> 32:40.697
Stay on the line, sir.
A unit is on the way.

32:50.055 --> 32:53.101
Daisy?

32:53.145 --> 32:55.321
He's not gonna hurt you anymore.
I just want to talk.

32:58.106 --> 32:59.064
[grunts]

32:59.107 --> 33:01.892
Easy, easy.

33:01.936 --> 33:05.157
Okay? He's the bad guy.
I'm the good guy.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.202
Look, I called 911.
The cops are on their way,

33:07.246 --> 33:09.726
but you need to
tell them the truth.

33:09.770 --> 33:11.293
The truth?

33:11.337 --> 33:13.382
Yeah, you can't let
an innocent man

33:13.426 --> 33:15.210
take the fall for Mason's death.

33:15.254 --> 33:18.170
Wait, you think...

33:18.213 --> 33:20.172
Why would I kill Ellis?

33:20.215 --> 33:23.088
His death screws up
everything for me.

33:23.131 --> 33:26.047
We were partners.

33:27.527 --> 33:29.137
I work for BioMerk
Pharmaceuticals.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.228
You supplied Mason
with the PEDs.

33:33.272 --> 33:36.275
It's not like we were
pushing the stuff.

33:36.318 --> 33:38.233
Ellis would sell
the samples I gave him

33:38.277 --> 33:39.408
and we'd split
the profits, 50-50.

33:39.452 --> 33:41.367
But Mason
wanted to stop.

33:41.410 --> 33:43.195
He spoke to you about
it over the phone.

33:43.238 --> 33:47.068
He always felt guilty
about what we were doing.

33:47.112 --> 33:49.375
Only did it to
supplement his income.

33:51.855 --> 33:54.467
His wife Brooke came from money.

33:54.510 --> 33:56.077
He was just trying
to provide her

33:56.121 --> 33:57.687
with the lifestyle
she was accustomed to.

33:57.731 --> 34:01.343
But Steuben said Mason
was your boyfriend.

34:01.387 --> 34:03.171
You're saying it was
strictly business.

34:03.215 --> 34:05.739
It was.

34:05.782 --> 34:08.742
I don't get why people assumed
we were sleeping together.

34:08.785 --> 34:11.223
MAGNUM:
Maybe everyone thought that,
but I could only think of

34:11.266 --> 34:12.354
one person who'd murder for it.

34:29.154 --> 34:31.808
Is that what's called
"unnecessary roughness"

34:31.852 --> 34:34.681
in the field?How'd you find me?

34:34.724 --> 34:38.032
You made it abundantly clear
how much you love this game.

34:38.076 --> 34:41.166
Almost as much
as you love your father.

34:43.168 --> 34:46.910
Mak, you didn't
have to run away.

34:46.954 --> 34:49.565
I heard what that
Child Welfare lady said

34:49.609 --> 34:52.133
about coming back
with a warrant.

34:52.177 --> 34:55.093
You wouldn't be able to stop
them from taking me away.

34:55.136 --> 34:58.096
You underestimate me

34:58.139 --> 35:00.620
and the white knight.

35:00.663 --> 35:03.710
Magnum won't quit until
he gets to the truth, okay?

35:03.753 --> 35:05.146
You can't either.

35:05.190 --> 35:09.150
If my dad doesn't come back...

35:09.194 --> 35:11.370
I'm alone.

35:11.413 --> 35:15.200
Your dad is counting on you
to be strong.

35:15.243 --> 35:17.593
He needs you to believe in him.

35:17.637 --> 35:20.292
That's what's gonna get him
through every hour of every day

35:20.335 --> 35:21.989
until this is over.

35:22.032 --> 35:25.601
And you won't
be alone.

35:25.645 --> 35:28.604
There's Coach TC, Magnum,

35:28.648 --> 35:30.128
their friend Rick,

35:30.171 --> 35:31.651
Kumu,

35:31.694 --> 35:33.174
even me.

35:34.741 --> 35:36.612
Whatever happens,

35:36.656 --> 35:39.267
you are not alone.

35:53.194 --> 35:55.153
What, man?

35:56.850 --> 35:59.940
I don't blame you for not
wanting to talk to me, okay?

35:59.983 --> 36:03.117
So, I'll do the talking
and you listen.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.075
I'm sorry.

36:05.119 --> 36:06.642
Okay?
You were right.

36:06.686 --> 36:09.471
You've followed my lead
when I've acted on instinct

36:09.515 --> 36:12.082
more times than I can count,

36:12.126 --> 36:14.389
but at the end of the day,
no matter what we did,

36:14.433 --> 36:15.825
we did it together.

36:15.869 --> 36:18.567
You got a point to make here?

36:18.611 --> 36:21.222
Yeah.

36:21.266 --> 36:24.138
I think I may know who
Ellis Mason's real killer is,

36:24.182 --> 36:27.533
but I can't do it without you.

36:27.576 --> 36:29.187
And your chopper.

36:39.109 --> 36:41.851
[phone rings]

36:41.895 --> 36:44.202
Hello?

36:44.245 --> 36:45.420
MAGNUM:
Hello, Mrs. Mason, this is

36:45.464 --> 36:47.596
Thomas Magnum.
I met you and your mother

36:47.640 --> 36:48.815
outside the
medical examiner's office.

36:50.251 --> 36:52.775
Yes, I remember,
Detective Magnum.

36:52.819 --> 36:55.125
No, no, actually,
I'm a private investigator.

36:55.169 --> 36:58.041
Listen, I've come across
some shocking information

36:58.085 --> 36:59.260
about your husband that you

36:59.304 --> 37:02.263
and the authorities
may not be aware of.

37:02.307 --> 37:04.613
What sort of information?

37:04.657 --> 37:07.268
It's probably better
if I show you.

37:07.312 --> 37:10.010
How quickly could you be
on a plane to Oahu?

37:32.162 --> 37:33.947
Now what?

37:33.990 --> 37:36.210
Brooke Mason's laundry.
Don't ask how we got it,

37:36.254 --> 37:38.517
just have Forensics run it
for gun shot residue.

37:38.560 --> 37:41.171
Look, Magnum, I know why you're
doing this. I'm not stupid.

37:41.215 --> 37:43.435
And that boy who's
staying at your place--

37:43.478 --> 37:44.436
he's Hani Iona's kid.

37:44.479 --> 37:45.741
If his father
goes away,

37:45.785 --> 37:47.308
he gets spat into
the foster care system.

37:47.352 --> 37:49.049
Look, I sympathize,

37:49.092 --> 37:51.530
but the prosecutor's
satisfied we have our guy.

37:51.573 --> 37:53.271
Show him.

37:53.314 --> 37:55.316
We also found this
airline receipt.

37:55.360 --> 37:58.319
It proves that Mason's
wife didn't fly to Oahu

37:58.363 --> 38:01.191
after you notified her
about her husband.

38:01.235 --> 38:03.585
She was already here.

38:03.629 --> 38:06.153
Two hours
before the murder.

38:06.196 --> 38:08.068
Should be enough to bring
her in for questioning

38:08.111 --> 38:09.635
until Forensics
finds the GSR.

38:09.678 --> 38:11.593
She'll be landing at the
airport in ten minutes.

38:15.945 --> 38:18.861
MAGNUM:
Mrs. Mason played off
the inconsistencies

38:18.905 --> 38:20.559
in her timeline as confusion.

38:20.602 --> 38:22.256
A jury might find that
understandable,

38:22.300 --> 38:24.214
considering
the emotional trauma,

38:24.258 --> 38:27.130
so a lot hinged on what Forensics found on the clothes.

38:27.174 --> 38:28.654
The ones she was wearing

38:28.697 --> 38:30.699
when she confronted her husband in that parking garage

38:30.743 --> 38:33.615
about an affair
he wasn't having.

38:33.659 --> 38:36.183
I began to realize that GSR
on Mrs. Mason's clothing

38:36.226 --> 38:38.228
wasn't gonna fully
exonerate Hani.

38:38.272 --> 38:39.186
For that...

38:39.229 --> 38:41.188
We need her
to confess.

38:41.231 --> 38:42.885
Huh? How do we do that?

38:42.929 --> 38:44.191
Go get Katsumoto,

38:44.234 --> 38:45.975
uh, tell him you want to
talk to him privately.

38:46.019 --> 38:47.586
About what?

38:47.629 --> 38:51.241
I don't care, just keep him
occupied as long as possible.

38:51.285 --> 38:52.460
All right.

38:55.768 --> 38:57.987
Detective, can I have a word?

38:58.031 --> 38:59.554
Now?

38:59.598 --> 39:02.078
Yeah.

39:02.122 --> 39:03.297
Excuse me a moment.

39:06.561 --> 39:07.997
What is it?

39:08.041 --> 39:10.260
Thought of something
that might be helpful.

39:10.304 --> 39:13.263
Look, when I was nine years old,

39:13.307 --> 39:15.962
my father went
and got himself arrested.

39:19.879 --> 39:21.533
Magnum.

39:21.576 --> 39:23.273
Mrs. Mason, I wasn't lying

39:23.317 --> 39:25.798
when I said I had new
information about your husband.

39:25.841 --> 39:28.540
I'm not interested in anything
you have to tell me.

39:28.583 --> 39:32.065
You were wrong.
He wasn't cheating on you.

39:32.108 --> 39:35.373
Daisy Chase and he were
business partners, that's all.

39:35.416 --> 39:37.244
In fact, he was
illegally selling steroids

39:37.287 --> 39:39.333
for you,

39:39.377 --> 39:41.379
to keep you living in luxury.

39:42.423 --> 39:44.294
I don't believe you.

39:44.338 --> 39:48.081
You made an understandable
but terrible mistake.

39:48.124 --> 39:50.257
You thought the person
you loved betrayed you,

39:50.300 --> 39:52.215
and I know how awful that feels.

39:53.695 --> 39:57.264
But Ellis was faithful.

39:57.307 --> 40:00.833
By all accounts,
he loved you, very much.

40:04.663 --> 40:07.056
And then, like,

40:07.100 --> 40:08.536
after all those years, man,

40:08.580 --> 40:11.670
I just was lying to myself,
lying to my friends.

40:11.713 --> 40:14.150
Now wh-what does all that
have to do with the case?

40:14.194 --> 40:17.589
You don't... you don't see
the poetry in all this?

40:17.632 --> 40:19.765
Poe...
Where's Magnum?

40:19.808 --> 40:21.462
[crying]:
It was an accident.

40:23.290 --> 40:26.249
I just wanted to talk to him.

40:26.293 --> 40:28.948
I picked up the gun,
but I didn't...

40:28.991 --> 40:31.820
I didn't mean to.

40:31.864 --> 40:34.475
I didn't mean to do it.

40:34.519 --> 40:36.608
MAGNUM:
Luckily, Katsumoto

40:36.651 --> 40:39.349
came back in time to hear Brooke Mason's full confession.

40:39.393 --> 40:42.396
Who knew if I was ever
gonna get her to repeat it.

40:53.538 --> 40:56.279
Hani still had to face
charges for the gun,

40:56.323 --> 40:58.368
but the confession was enough
to get him released on bail,

40:58.412 --> 41:00.153
which TC posted.

41:00.196 --> 41:02.111
Again.

41:26.962 --> 41:29.748
So, uh...

41:29.791 --> 41:32.011
I know we never
actually, um...

41:32.054 --> 41:33.360
Y... I know.

41:35.144 --> 41:36.537
I mean, I know
you apologized,

41:36.581 --> 41:39.758
but I didn't really
accept it, officially.

41:41.194 --> 41:42.891
That's true.

41:45.372 --> 41:47.156
Are we good?

41:49.202 --> 41:51.291
Always, brother.

41:51.334 --> 41:54.512
[chuckles]

42:00.735 --> 42:03.564
[crowd cheering]

42:03.608 --> 42:04.870
[whistle blows]Mak-man.

42:08.308 --> 42:11.441
Lateral 22, just like we worked
on at practice, all right?

42:11.485 --> 42:14.227
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go, let's go,

42:14.270 --> 42:16.751
let's go!

42:16.795 --> 42:19.493
Come on, Makoa!
[whoops]

42:19.537 --> 42:21.060
Hey, Tommy boy,
you care to make this game

42:21.103 --> 42:22.496
a little more interesting?

42:22.540 --> 42:24.106
[chuckles]
Are you seriously suggesting

42:24.150 --> 42:25.760
betting on a child's
football game?

42:25.804 --> 42:27.414
Hey, I'll take action
on anything.

42:27.457 --> 42:29.372
I'll take a piece of that.You're in.

42:29.416 --> 42:31.374
So will I.

42:32.071 --> 42:33.899
What?

42:33.942 --> 42:36.249
I'm not against
a friendly wager.

42:36.292 --> 42:38.817
Doesn't change the fact
that American football

42:38.860 --> 42:40.427
is nothing more
than an over-padded,

42:40.470 --> 42:43.082
far too regulated
bastardization of rugby.

42:49.349 --> 42:51.743
Go, Makoa! Go, Mak!

42:51.786 --> 42:53.614
[whoops]

42:53.658 --> 42:55.007
Oh.

42:57.487 --> 42:59.925
But... it has its charms.
