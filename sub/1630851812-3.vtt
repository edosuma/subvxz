[speaks indistinctly]
What were you thinking, Ike?

01:19.746 --> 01:23.208
You need to respect me! How can I respect
you if you don't respect me? How can--

01:23.292 --> 01:24.543
How can I give you respect…

01:24.626 --> 01:26.628
Please listen to me.
Can you please listen to me, Dad?

01:26.712 --> 01:29.298

Hey, you gotta see this, man.

-[people in gym cheering]
-Damn. Who the hell is that?

03:33.130 --> 03:35.090
Some 14-year-old phenom
from the neighborhood.

03:35.632 --> 03:36.884
He's good.

03:37.676 --> 03:38.677
But look who he's playing.

03:46.977 --> 03:47.978
Icon.

03:51.523 --> 03:53.317
How's your American dream report coming?

03:53.901 --> 03:55.527
Only have the opening line.

03:56.153 --> 03:57.279
Let's hear it.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.574
They always told me to follow my dreams.

You know you wanna say it.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.442
I do?

05:16.400 --> 05:17.442
[sighs] I do?

05:17.526 --> 05:18.652
You know you do.

05:19.444 --> 05:23.448

It was worth it.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.547

by hitting that post.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.800
When was the last time
you had the engine checked?

07:08.095 --> 07:10.556
Well, what did you do
when you heard the clanking noise?

07:10.639 --> 07:11.807
Turned the radio up.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.893
Okay. Well, we fix the bumper.
That ain't no problem.

07:14.977 --> 07:17.229
But you really need to find out
what's going on with this engine.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.439
Okay.

07:20.649 --> 07:24.194
Well, give me the underpaid,

not meet with you, man. Damn.

That's fire.

07:46.008 --> 07:48.802
Still can't believe you were
Lester Davis's teammate in high school.

07:48.886 --> 07:50.137
He was my teammate.

07:52.389 --> 07:53.765
Come on, man.

07:56.894 --> 07:57.895
Is that homework?

07:58.937 --> 08:00.105
It's gotta be.

08:00.189 --> 08:01.773
Kids nowadays don't read.

08:02.858 --> 08:05.235
It's actually research for my oral report.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.530
The writer's trying to explain racism
to his son.

08:10.532 --> 08:13.118
It's kind of hard to explain something
that doesn't make any sense.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.832
At least basketball makes sense.

08:19.625 --> 08:20.626
Right, Coach?

08:20.709 --> 08:23.837
Some people say basketball
reflects society.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.256
Basketball and your book.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.261
Seems like they want the same thing.

08:31.345 --> 08:32.513
And what's that?

08:33.931 --> 08:34.932
Harmony.

Want to know
what my pops explained to me?

08:49.154 --> 08:51.532
-What?
-Nothing.

08:57.079 --> 08:58.580
When was the last time you saw him?

09:01.792 --> 09:02.876
I was four.

09:05.504 --> 09:06.505
Damn.

09:07.798 --> 09:09.800
It's all good. He'll regret it.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.910
Come on in. What's up?

09:36.994 --> 09:37.995
How you doing?

09:41.415 --> 09:42.416

11:04.998 --> 11:08.210
Oh, my God. [gasps]

11:08.293 --> 11:12.714
And check this: Lester wasn't even
as good as us when he was our age.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.383
This could be us one day.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.636
Think about that
when you're hooping tomorrow.

11:18.512 --> 11:19.888
Hey, I gotta go.

11:18.512 --> 11:19.888
[Crystal] Hey, I gotta go.

Man. It's been a long-ass time.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.335
How are moms and Papa Ray?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.335
Oh, how, uh-- how are moms and Papa Ray?

11:50.419 --> 11:51.670
They doing good, man.

11:51.753 --> 11:55.841
Pop just retired, so now he's at home
all the time, driving my moms crazy.

11:55.924 --> 11:56.967
[chuckles]

11:57.050 --> 11:59.845
What's up with you though, man?
I heard you working at… what?

11:59.928 --> 12:01.513
Independence Tool and Repair?

12:02.931 --> 12:05.392
-Doing what I gotta do.
-Like knocking out that coach?

12:05.475 --> 12:07.477
-[inhales deeply]
-[chuckles] I heard he had it coming.

12:07.561 --> 12:10.522
[chuckles] Yeah. You hear a lot about me.

12:12.441 --> 12:13.567
Why's that?

12:15.694 --> 12:20.032
That video with you and the kid
got me all sentimental and shit.

12:21.033 --> 12:23.243
Hope you're not teaching him
to fly off the handle like you do.

12:23.911 --> 12:26.955
Teaching him not to care about
the opinions of people that don't matter.

12:28.498 --> 12:29.583
Classic Icon, huh?

12:30.626 --> 12:31.627
Yeah. [sighs]

12:32.920 --> 12:34.922
It's all good. I'ma show some love.

12:35.631 --> 12:37.799
I'm looking to sponsor a team,
and I want it to be yours.

12:38.717 --> 12:41.512
I'll hook you up with some fresh-ass gear,
give you a salary too

12:41.595 --> 12:44.181
to get you out of that
plumbing-store situation that you're in.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.933
I know you and T got a baby on the way.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.730
What's in it for you?
Tax write-offs or something?

12:51.813 --> 12:54.399
Ike, there's a lot of things I could do
for a tax write-off, brother.

12:55.192 --> 12:57.402
Helping you change your life
is the only incentive that I need.

13:58.839 --> 14:03.552
What's up, young king?
The Phenom and Icon.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.472
I'll wait to hear from you.
I mean what I said.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.433
Let's go, Jace.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.396
Yo, Mr. Davis. Can I get a pic real quick?

14:14.479 --> 14:16.315
Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Let's do it.

14:19.651 --> 14:20.652
A'ight. Say, "money."

14:21.320 --> 14:22.321
Money.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.740
-All right, man. I'ma see you.
-For sure, bro.

14:24.823 --> 14:25.824
-Appreciate you.
-You be easy.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.492
Keep working on that game, all right?

14:27.576 --> 14:30.787
Now, we all have dreams.
To be relevant.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.414
To not be forgotten.

14:33.582 --> 14:35.167
To build a legacy.

14:36.168 --> 14:37.252
But where does that start?

14:39.421 --> 14:40.547
Disruption.

14:41.423 --> 14:43.467
I mean, that's the name of the game
nowadays, isn't it?

14:43.550 --> 14:45.719
It's a big word,
but all it really means is,

14:45.802 --> 14:48.972
the little fish don't swim with the sharks
if it wants to survive.

14:49.056 --> 14:53.018
It has to be faster. Get to where
everyone else is trying to get to first.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.770
Cool story, bro.

14:54.853 --> 14:57.648
But the bigs ate Reebok
when they moved into team sponsorship.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.275
So, what makes your plan different?

15:00.359 --> 15:04.780
Well, I start with acceptance of where
we are in the sports apparel ecosystem.

15:04.863 --> 15:07.324
Now, as it stands, we are in retail stores

15:07.407 --> 15:09.910
all over the United States,
Europe and Japan.

15:09.993 --> 15:13.413
And in a little over two years,
our online sales are still coming in hot.

15:14.456 --> 15:17.501
But that doesn't put us in position to go
head-to-head with Nike and Adidas.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.837
Nor should we want to. Honestly.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.798
I mean, these guys
are outfitting full college teams.

15:22.881 --> 15:25.425
Giving multimillion-dollar contracts
to NBA stars.

15:25.509 --> 15:30.305
You're saying we go after high schoolers?
The majors are already in bed with them.

15:30.389 --> 15:35.602
That's true. But as disrupters, we gotta
get to where we're trying to go first.

15:35.686 --> 15:37.980
-We have to find our niche.
-Which is?

15:41.400 --> 15:42.693
Eighth graders.

15:43.569 --> 15:45.195
Sponsoring middle schools?

15:45.279 --> 15:48.907
No, that's not where the action is.
The heat is here.

15:49.491 --> 15:50.617
As we all know,

15:50.701 --> 15:52.494
nowadays, these grassroots programs

15:52.578 --> 15:54.788
are where the best talent
is getting their start.

15:55.747 --> 15:56.999
We gotta build a rapport with them.

15:57.082 --> 16:00.377
This is our future D1 and NBA stars.

16:01.587 --> 16:05.799
These are young, elite athletes
that are posting highlight videos

16:05.883 --> 16:10.429
on social media platforms that are getting
hundreds of thousands of hits.

16:10.512 --> 16:12.598
I mean, this is the type of exposure
that we need.

16:12.681 --> 16:15.726
And come ninth grade,
the majors'll scoop 'em up anyways.

16:15.809 --> 16:18.228
They'll try. But we would've
already established a rapport

16:18.312 --> 16:19.646
with them and their families.

16:19.730 --> 16:21.857
Before Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour

16:21.940 --> 16:23.525
-even knew they existed.
-That's right.

16:25.152 --> 16:28.113
Now, the strategy
starts in five major markets.

16:28.197 --> 16:32.242
Memphis, New Orleans, Detroit,
Houston, and right here, DC Metro.

16:32.326 --> 16:34.786
One team per city.

16:34.870 --> 16:38.540
We find the best player in each area,
and we cultivate them.

16:38.624 --> 16:39.875
Put 'em in the best camps.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.793
We introduce 'em to the best coaches.

16:41.877 --> 16:46.423
We literally structure a path
for our superstars to make it to the NBA.

16:48.717 --> 16:50.677
All while wearing Gladiators, of course.

17:02.439 --> 17:05.442
[people chattering]

17:08.237 --> 17:10.696
-[Ike sighs]
-The air feels different out here now.

17:12.574 --> 17:15.786
Man, rich people and poor people
breathe the same damn air.

17:19.289 --> 17:20.874
Guess I've been worried that…

17:22.125 --> 17:24.252
everything I want could be slipping away.

17:26.171 --> 17:29.132
Like, if I don't grab it right now,

17:30.968 --> 17:32.219
it'll all be gone.

17:33.387 --> 17:36.014
But it all feels so real now.

17:36.682 --> 17:38.308
No way I'm not gonna make it.

17:40.310 --> 17:41.311
Nothing's stopping me.

17:44.064 --> 17:45.440
American dream.

17:47.776 --> 17:48.902
Right, Coach?

18:00.497 --> 18:02.291
[sniffing]

18:02.374 --> 18:07.462
What is this? Mmm. Coach,
there's no way you cooked this. [scoffs]

18:08.380 --> 18:09.381
Sorpresa! [laughs]

18:09.464 --> 18:11.884
-Mami!
-Nicolàs! [laughs]

18:11.967 --> 18:13.719
Mijo. [inhales sharply]

18:13.802 --> 18:16.054
[in Spanish] I missed you so much!

18:16.138 --> 18:17.389
-[in Spanish] How did you get here?
-[chuckles]

18:17.472 --> 18:18.891
[Nick, in English] Coach, did you do this?

18:18.974 --> 18:19.975
We wanted to surprise you.

18:20.058 --> 18:21.310
[in Spanish] I can't believe it--
Ay, Mami!

18:21.393 --> 18:22.394
[chuckles]

18:22.477 --> 18:23.562
[in English] How long are you staying?

18:23.645 --> 18:25.898
[in Spanish] A week. [chuckles]

18:25.981 --> 18:27.733
You look good, Papi!

18:27.816 --> 18:29.651
[in English] He grew, no?
After two months.

18:30.527 --> 18:31.570
[exhales sharply]

18:31.653 --> 18:34.740
[in Spanish]
Take a step back, let me look at you.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.158
[Nick, Teresa chuckling]

18:36.241 --> 18:39.453
Wait, wait, wait, what is this?
Let me see.

18:39.536 --> 18:42.372
What did you do to your hair?

18:43.373 --> 18:44.917
-What is this?
-What? No. Don't look at me.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.587
Ma. I want to know where I come from.

18:48.670 --> 18:51.298
This boy is crazy!

18:51.840 --> 18:53.634
But he's my boy.

18:53.717 --> 18:54.718
Mami.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.137
[slurps]

18:59.681 --> 19:00.682
Babe, have you seen my phone?

19:57.865 --> 20:01.285
What is this woe-is-me shit, Black man?
That ain't you.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.371
I just know
this ain't what you signed up for.

20:04.454 --> 20:06.248
Don't tell me what I signed up for.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.417
And I don't even like bowling.

20:11.712 --> 20:12.713
Yeah.

20:14.131 --> 20:15.215
What'd he want?

20:15.757 --> 20:16.758
Sponsor the team.

20:18.343 --> 20:19.887
"Sponsor" as in pay you a salary?

20:20.846 --> 20:24.266
Pretty much. Said if we win the next game,
he'll make it official.

20:25.976 --> 20:27.144
So he's turning it into a bet?

20:27.227 --> 20:28.437
That's how he is.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.647
Well, what'd you tell him?

20:30.731 --> 20:32.065
Nothing yet.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.651
What will you tell him?

20:40.365 --> 20:42.367
We could use the paper.

20:44.453 --> 20:45.787
Could be really great for us.

20:47.497 --> 20:48.498
Yeah.

20:49.625 --> 20:51.126
It really could.

20:51.210 --> 20:52.211
Yeah.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.007
Whatever happened
between y'all two anyway?

20:57.090 --> 21:02.221
Some teenage bullshit.
I can't really remember.

21:04.598 --> 21:06.308
Of course. Okay.

21:06.391 --> 21:07.601
Hey, hey.

21:07.684 --> 21:10.395
-You need them?
-I would need these.

21:13.148 --> 21:14.149
You good?

21:15.526 --> 21:16.610
I'm great, baby.

21:17.778 --> 21:18.779
Okay.

21:20.155 --> 21:21.156
I love you.

21:21.240 --> 21:23.075
-Love you.
-Say, "Bye, Daddy."

21:23.158 --> 21:24.409
-Bye, babies.
-Okay.

21:32.918 --> 21:34.795
-What's up, Jace?
-What's good?

21:54.439 --> 21:55.440
Okay.

21:57.025 --> 21:58.569
Hey, Tamika?

22:00.654 --> 22:03.949
-Want any help?
-Yeah, thanks. Can you tape it for me?

22:04.032 --> 22:05.701
Oh, yeah. All right.

22:08.245 --> 22:10.831
So, what are you gonna do
if somebody tries to, like, rip this off?

22:10.914 --> 22:12.040
Put up a new one.

22:12.124 --> 22:15.794
The election's in two weeks.
You do plan on voting, right?

22:15.878 --> 22:17.379
You have my vote.

22:17.462 --> 22:18.463
Thank you.

22:20.799 --> 22:25.137
So… we got a game at the rec on Saturday.

22:27.055 --> 22:29.850
And I thought maybe you'd want to come.

22:29.933 --> 22:31.810
Why would I want to do that?

22:31.894 --> 22:34.438
Well, I mean,
it's gonna be a pretty big game.

22:34.521 --> 22:38.192
Everyone's talking about it.
They're calling it "Rumble in the DMV."

22:38.901 --> 22:40.694
-Okay.
-And…

22:42.279 --> 22:44.031
I'm gonna dedicate my game to you.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.328
Why are you always trying to talk to me?

22:49.912 --> 22:53.373
Well…
you remember in Miss Marshall's class

22:53.457 --> 22:56.376
when she made us all say
something about ourselves.

22:56.460 --> 22:57.461
You said you were a Muslim.

22:57.544 --> 23:00.672
And you said being Muslim
doesn't tell you who I am.

23:01.381 --> 23:02.925
It just tells you what my religion is.

23:03.592 --> 23:06.428
So now you're saying a basketball player
is who you are?

23:06.512 --> 23:10.349
No. See, playing basketball,
that's what I do.

23:10.432 --> 23:12.726
Now, how I play it, that's when
you really get to see who I am.

23:13.519 --> 23:14.937
You know, I have a motto.

23:16.230 --> 23:19.066
It's "When they go high, I go low."

23:19.942 --> 23:20.943
You know.

23:22.277 --> 23:24.821
Well, because, you know,
'cause everybody else is so tall,

23:24.905 --> 23:27.741
and I'm, you know, low.
Dribbling the ball. Low, and you know.

23:27.824 --> 23:31.078
Anyway, if you can,
you should really come.

23:33.455 --> 23:34.873
I might.

23:36.917 --> 23:39.253
-I'm gonna need the tape.
-Oh, yeah. This is yours.

23:39.336 --> 23:42.089
You're gonna need that if you
wanna put up some more si-- All right.

23:42.172 --> 23:44.424
See ya in school.

23:48.011 --> 23:49.513
"I might." All right.

24:02.860 --> 24:06.154
Yo, Coach. You did not tell us
we'd be scrimmaging your old team today.

24:06.238 --> 24:07.281
What?

24:09.032 --> 24:10.367
What's he talking about?

24:10.450 --> 24:13.453
All right. Feel that beat, y'all. Uh-huh.

24:13.537 --> 24:16.290
We're about to go left.
We're going up. So, stay together.

24:16.373 --> 24:18.417
Where you at? Good job.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.294
-And right. And left.
-Coach.

24:21.461 --> 24:23.714
-All right, everyone.
-What is this, 1985?

24:23.797 --> 24:26.049
And one, reach, reach.

24:26.133 --> 24:27.718
-Good!
-Yo.

24:27.801 --> 24:29.595
-Uh-huh.
-Competition's fierce.

24:29.678 --> 24:31.096
-Let's go.
-What's this?

24:31.180 --> 24:32.181
I know.

24:32.264 --> 24:33.891
So, we gonna cancel practice?

24:35.350 --> 24:37.019
What do you think, Vince?

24:37.102 --> 24:38.395
Think I'ma cancel practice?

24:38.478 --> 24:40.647
-Nah, Coach. No way.
-Ready?

24:41.315 --> 24:42.357
What's going on?

24:42.441 --> 24:45.903
I told the rec manager five o'clock,
but he don't be writing shit down.

24:45.986 --> 24:48.363
-Down.
-What are they doing?

24:48.447 --> 24:49.448
Come on.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.241
-Know Alonzo Powers?
-No.

24:51.325 --> 24:54.161
He's a shoe exec from Gladiator.

24:54.244 --> 24:55.829
I just got word
he's stopping by our practice.

24:55.913 --> 24:56.914
For what?

24:57.581 --> 24:59.124
He wants to see what we're about.

24:59.958 --> 25:02.294
-You know how big this is?
-I can't deal with that right now.

25:03.253 --> 25:04.254
You can't deal with it?

25:04.338 --> 25:06.048
No. First, it's Lester Davis.

25:06.131 --> 25:08.342
Now you sweatin' me
about some shoe pusher.

25:08.425 --> 25:10.135
Can I just focus
on getting us another dub?

25:10.219 --> 25:11.512
That cool with you?

25:11.595 --> 25:12.679
'Cause it cool with me.

25:14.223 --> 25:16.683
Good.
Don't take a break yet, y'all. Come on.

25:47.756 --> 25:49.883
Hey, how you doin', Jenna?

25:49.967 --> 25:52.135
Guess I'm about to find out.

25:55.347 --> 25:56.557
Come on now.

25:56.640 --> 26:00.018
I discounted the parts,
but I can't do nothing about the labor.

26:00.102 --> 26:02.396
Glenn, you know I don't have
this kind of cash.

26:02.479 --> 26:05.148
-Can you put it on a credit card?
-And get more jammed up?

26:05.232 --> 26:09.278
I got two jobs, two kids,
and Jace eats like three grown-ass men.

26:09.361 --> 26:12.573
I'm sorry, sweetie.
That's-- That is the best I can do.

26:17.870 --> 26:19.580
Does the car run at least?

26:20.831 --> 26:23.292
I wouldn't let my mother-in-law
drive that car.

26:28.714 --> 26:30.424
Hey, how is Cynthia?

26:31.133 --> 26:34.261
She's doing good. She's very good.

26:34.344 --> 26:37.556
We are celebrating
our 23-year anniversary.

26:37.639 --> 26:40.142
-Twenty-three years.
-How about that?

26:40.225 --> 26:41.226
Damn.

26:46.273 --> 26:49.651
Glenn, have you gotten her anything yet?

26:49.735 --> 26:51.612
I am working on it.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.742
-Can you just get that? All right.
-Yo, what are you doing?

26:56.825 --> 26:58.702
-You trying to pull the knees off?
-Got it.

26:59.870 --> 27:02.372
This is an opportunity for us to show up.

27:02.456 --> 27:06.668
It may not seem like it,
but times like these build character.

27:06.752 --> 27:08.837
Yo, does tetanus build character?

27:06.752 --> 27:10.130
-Yo, does tetanus build character?
-[teammates chuckling]

27:10.214 --> 27:11.965

27:12.883 --> 27:14.384
Oh, my God.

27:14.468 --> 27:16.011
How are we even
supposed to practice in here?

27:16.094 --> 27:17.638
Alonzo Powers, please.

27:17.721 --> 27:21.433
If you haven't noticed already, Coach,
there is no hoop in here.

27:21.517 --> 27:22.518
[Royale laughs]

27:22.601 --> 27:25.854
You want us to fill the pool with water?

27:22.601 --> 27:26.313
You want us to fill the pool with water?
[chuckles]

27:26.396 --> 27:27.648
[Jace chuckles]

27:27.731 --> 27:31.109
Nah. We gonna fill it with sweat.

27:33.612 --> 27:36.031
One, two, go!

27:33.612 --> 27:36.031
[teammates, chanting] One, two, go!

27:37.199 --> 27:40.786
We got the win last week,
but we're not still not jelling.

27:40.869 --> 27:45.082
We have to play together.
We don't buy into the hype!

27:40.869 --> 27:44.331
We have to play together.
We don't buy into the hype!

27:44.414 --> 27:45.541
[chanting continues]

27:45.624 --> 27:48.752
Y'all think y'all can rumble?
I will show you how to rumble.

27:49.336 --> 27:51.463
-What's the best part of the game?
-Defense!

Go, go. Get wide. Get your feet going!

29:14.463 --> 29:17.257
-Don't worry.
-You all right?

29:17.341 --> 29:20.427
I'm fine, guys. Shit, I'm totally…

29:27.434 --> 29:28.810
Oh, my gosh.

29:36.693 --> 29:37.694
Look…

29:40.280 --> 29:42.741
Man, I invited Tamika to the game.

29:43.492 --> 29:44.493
For real?

29:44.576 --> 29:47.204
Yeah, but you can't tell nobody.
All right?

29:47.287 --> 29:50.040
I'm really trying to keep this low-key.

29:50.123 --> 29:52.125
Low-key. No, I got you, bro.

29:52.209 --> 29:53.752
-All right. Thank you, man.
-I got you.

29:57.548 --> 30:00.717

30:04.680 --> 30:06.557
Man, why you lyin'? [laughs]

30:06.640 --> 30:09.685
It ain't even like that, Phil.
We just talking right now.

30:09.768 --> 30:11.270
Hold up. Let's look her up on Insta.

30:11.353 --> 30:13.438
-Let's see that Instagram.
-Royale, look. I'm not even trying

30:11.353 --> 30:13.438
-[Phil] Let's see that Instagram.
-Royale, look. I'm not even trying

30:13.522 --> 30:16.024
-to put her out there like that, bro.
-That's 'cause she's imaginary, dog.

30:16.108 --> 30:17.359
You know, give me this.

30:17.442 --> 30:20.487
So, Phil, this look imaginary to you?

30:17.442 --> 30:21.321
So, Phil, this look imaginary to you? Hmm?

30:22.489 --> 30:23.949
-Okay, Mus.
-Exactly. Exactly.

30:22.489 --> 30:23.949
-Okay, Mus.

-Okay, Mus.

-Put some respect on my name.
-[Phil] Okay, Mus.

30:27.202 --> 30:30.205
-Yo, what? Like…
-She's really comin' through?

30:30.289 --> 30:32.791
-I mean…
-If she does, you better show out.

30:32.875 --> 30:35.752
Hey. We should go in there,
hit 'em hard early,

30:35.836 --> 30:37.838
get a cushion, and let him do his thing.

30:37.921 --> 30:40.174
-I like this guy.
-I like what you sayin', man.

-I like this guy.
-[Phil] I like what you sayin', man.

30:40.257 --> 30:42.259
Yeah, but what about Mendez?

will continue to be unpredictable,

[speaks Spanish]

31:11.455 --> 31:13.457
This is the school I wanted to show you.

31:14.458 --> 31:15.792
Top-rated athletics.

31:16.418 --> 31:20.339
And, Teresa, you'll be happy to know that
they take their academics very seriously.

31:20.422 --> 31:23.926
You don't perform in the classroom, you're
not on the court. Our team's a feeder.

31:24.009 --> 31:25.469
[speaks Spanish] …feeder?

31:25.552 --> 31:27.930
It just means
that I can get our best players here.

Ma. [speaks Spanish]

31:33.727 --> 31:35.145

He is the number one player in the DMV.

"Oh, okay"?

31:57.459 --> 31:58.919
You know how bad that makes me look?

31:59.795 --> 32:03.632
Well, next time you invite someone
to our practice, you give me a heads-up.

33:00.981 --> 33:02.774
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

33:03.692 --> 33:04.818
You guys got history.

33:05.903 --> 33:07.321
And it wasn't all good.

33:09.323 --> 33:10.407
How'd you leave it?

We get this W…

New businesses,
they rarely make money this early on.

And you're telling me
that that can happen this weekend?

33:27.466 --> 33:28.467
Looks like it.

33:30.802 --> 33:32.513
-No offense…
-But?

33:32.596 --> 33:34.973
Sounds like you're trying
to talk yourself out of this.

33:36.642 --> 33:39.144
You're gonna have to get your head
around whether this is about your pride

33:39.228 --> 33:40.771
or what's best for the team.

-Yes!

34:30.696 --> 34:32.614
Y'all see that? She was killin' it.

34:32.697 --> 34:34.241
She was awesome out there.

34:35.074 --> 34:36.243
-Crystal!
-Baby girl.

34:36.326 --> 34:39.454
There she is. Come in here.

34:39.538 --> 34:41.415
Hey.

34:43.083 --> 34:44.083
I gotta tell you.

34:44.168 --> 34:47.087
I've never seen a player bounce back
from an injury so well.

34:47.170 --> 34:49.089
Coach. She got good genes.

34:50.299 --> 34:51.632
-Hey, baby.
-Hey, baby.

34:51.717 --> 34:53.635
Hey, good game. Good game.

34:53.719 --> 34:55.429
-Hey! Great game today.
-You know,

34:55.512 --> 34:57.514
when she first joined the team,

34:57.598 --> 35:01.435
Crystal had a reputation
for being a bit hard on the coaches.

35:01.518 --> 35:02.936
That was bull.

35:03.437 --> 35:05.606
She just needed a coach
to match her intensity.

35:05.689 --> 35:07.024
I hear that.

35:09.359 --> 35:11.111
You're like Phil and M.J.

35:13.989 --> 35:16.283
-I like that.
-Hey, yeah.

35:19.453 --> 35:22.497
This is great for your skin tone,
but not for this occasion.

35:22.581 --> 35:23.874
Okay.

35:26.210 --> 35:27.544
Kids in high school?

35:28.504 --> 35:32.132
Jackie is,
and Jace is about to finish eighth grade.

35:33.884 --> 35:35.552
I remember that age.

35:35.636 --> 35:38.597
I call it the "me, me, me" era.

35:38.680 --> 35:41.225
Right? Lord, help me.

35:42.976 --> 35:45.979
Well, when they're older
and have to take care of their own kids,

35:46.563 --> 35:49.566
that's when they'll finally realize
what we do.

35:49.650 --> 35:52.569
Girl, I hope so.
Between my son's protein shakes

35:52.653 --> 35:55.113
and my daughter's costumes
for step team,

35:55.989 --> 35:57.491
they bleed me dry.

35:57.574 --> 35:58.992
I gotta tell you, Jenna,

35:59.076 --> 36:02.412
it's hard enough for Glenn and I
to manage our kids together.

36:02.496 --> 36:04.790
I don't know how you do this alone.

36:04.873 --> 36:06.542
[smacks lips] I don't think about it.

36:05.290 --> 36:06.542
I don't think about it.

36:06.625 --> 36:09.294
I just do what needs to get done.

36:09.378 --> 36:11.547
Okay, for the final touch…

36:09.378 --> 36:12.297
-Okay, for the final touch…
-Mmm.

36:12.381 --> 36:15.759
Before, you were a good mom.

36:12.381 --> 36:15.759
-Before, you were a good mom.
-[chuckles]

36:16.468 --> 36:20.389
Now, you a bad mama.

36:24.268 --> 36:25.519
Damn, girl.

36:24.268 --> 36:26.436
-Damn, girl.
-[chuckles]

36:26.520 --> 36:28.939
-You got skills.
-It's what I do.

36:26.520 --> 36:28.814
-You got skills.
-It's what I do.

36:28.897 --> 36:30.440
[both chuckling]

36:30.524 --> 36:31.984
-[knocking]
-[gasps]

36:32.067 --> 36:33.443
Mmm.

36:35.279 --> 36:36.405
[Jenna] Mm-hmm.

36:38.240 --> 36:39.658
Lord, have mercy.

36:39.741 --> 36:40.951
[Cynthia chuckles]

36:41.034 --> 36:43.829
Uh, you look beautiful, baby.

36:41.326 --> 36:43.829
You look beautiful, baby.

36:43.912 --> 36:46.373
Mm-hmm. Uh-uh.

36:45.205 --> 36:46.373
Uh-uh.

36:46.957 --> 36:48.542
I love you.

36:48.625 --> 36:51.962
But you can't mess up my lipstick… yet.

36:52.045 --> 36:54.715
-[chuckles] Oh. Oh. Okay.
-Uh.

36:54.298 --> 36:56.091
Okay. Watch out.

36:54.798 --> 36:56.091
-Mmm. Mmm.
-Watch out.

36:56.175 --> 36:58.635
[chuckles]
Okay, don't forget your gift bags.

36:56.758 --> 36:58.635
Okay, don't forget your gift bags.

36:58.719 --> 37:00.220
I'm gonna put you on that emailing list.

37:56.235 --> 38:00.697
And if I tell my mom, she gonna get
all protective and act like I can't play.

38:00.781 --> 38:04.535
Coach is gonna put a limit on my PT,
and Mendez is gonna get more shine,

38:04.618 --> 38:06.912
and hell no!

38:06.995 --> 38:08.247
I can't have that.

38:09.289 --> 38:10.707
Just can't.

38:10.791 --> 38:11.917
Hell no.

38:15.420 --> 38:16.421
What?

38:17.339 --> 38:18.340
Bye, Jace.

38:19.258 --> 38:21.760
You said you wanted to talk
about somethin'.

38:21.844 --> 38:24.429
That was before this conversation
became about you.

38:24.513 --> 38:25.889
It's always about you.

38:25.973 --> 38:28.141
The kid took my spot in the rankings.

38:28.225 --> 38:30.227
You sayin' that's not a big deal?

38:30.894 --> 38:33.355
I'm sayin' I have homework,
and you gotta go.

38:34.648 --> 38:36.233
You should keep that fire, Crys.

38:36.316 --> 38:38.819
It's a good look for the court. But damn.

38:40.112 --> 38:41.947
Otherwise, you miserable.

38:44.324 --> 38:45.617
Miserable, shorty.

39:08.348 --> 39:10.934
And that's my dream report. Thank you.

39:13.103 --> 39:16.899
Okay. Our next book report
is from Jace Carson.

39:26.700 --> 39:29.578
And since Nick's mother
is visiting this week,

39:29.661 --> 39:32.706
he's giving his report
on his family and Puerto Rico.

39:38.378 --> 39:40.589
"They told me to follow my dreams.

39:41.632 --> 39:43.717
Maybe that's something they say
to a lot of kids.

39:43.800 --> 39:45.385
But when you get older,

39:46.220 --> 39:48.305
sometimes dreams don't seem realistic."

39:57.022 --> 39:59.900
My mother and father told me
the greatest thing you can do

39:59.983 --> 40:02.528
is believe in yourself
and believe in your dreams.

40:03.153 --> 40:08.784
"Even the stress, decisions,
and anger from disappointments

40:08.867 --> 40:11.703
don't have the power to stop you
unless you give your power away."

40:14.540 --> 40:18.210
"The territory has a total population
of approximately…"

40:58.250 --> 40:59.459
Hey!

41:04.423 --> 41:05.465
Two, three.

41:19.229 --> 41:21.398
-Thanks so much. Bye.
-Oh, my God. That was…

41:31.491 --> 41:35.621
-Hey, Jenna.
-Hey. How are you?

41:43.045 --> 41:44.671
Well,
if things don't work out with Lester,

41:45.839 --> 41:47.508
looks like Gladiator's still in play.

41:48.258 --> 41:49.635
Yeah, how you doin'?

41:52.429 --> 41:54.848
Hey, baby. I told you
you didn't have to come to this game,

41:54.932 --> 41:56.058
the way your back been hurting.

41:56.141 --> 41:58.810
This is what I signed up for. So…

41:58.894 --> 42:00.646
-Well, let me get that.
-I got it. Thank you.

42:00.729 --> 42:01.730
Okay--

42:02.731 --> 42:04.733
Don't be yelling at me in front of people.

42:06.235 --> 42:07.736
-D-up!
-Let's go.

42:14.117 --> 42:15.369
-Stay with him.
-Pressure. Pressure.

42:15.452 --> 42:17.037
Come on. Pressure, pressure.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.121
Come on, Jace!

42:19.998 --> 42:21.333
Knock it!

42:21.416 --> 42:22.751
Oh, yes!

42:22.835 --> 42:24.378
That's it! Let's go.

42:27.840 --> 42:30.342
-Let's go.
-Let's go. Come on.

42:31.677 --> 42:34.096
Mus! Mus! Mus!

42:34.179 --> 42:35.222
Run it.

42:44.314 --> 42:46.525
Move it. Move it. Move it.

42:50.028 --> 42:52.781
Hell yeah! That's beautiful basketball.

42:52.865 --> 42:54.283
Great pass, Jace!

42:54.366 --> 42:56.285
-See?
-Block him.

42:56.368 --> 42:59.621
You gotta keep him blocked, Jace!
Make it stop, baby!

43:00.205 --> 43:01.957
Get it in! Get it in!

43:14.511 --> 43:16.805
Keep ballin' on 'em, Jace! You own them!

43:22.686 --> 43:25.731
Let's go. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

43:33.363 --> 43:34.740
Yes, sir!

43:36.450 --> 43:37.910
Way to go! Come on, Jace!

43:43.290 --> 43:44.791
It's comin'. I see it!

43:48.253 --> 43:50.839
Hit Musa on the wing! Musa on the wing!

44:09.191 --> 44:10.359
Let's go!

44:12.361 --> 44:13.362
Hey, give me the ball!

44:21.119 --> 44:23.038
They always told me to follow my dreams.

44:24.289 --> 44:27.000
Maybe that's something they say
to a lot of kids.

44:27.084 --> 44:31.505
But when you get older,
sometimes dreams don't seem realistic.

44:33.173 --> 44:35.342
'Cause reaching your dreams
can be painful.

44:36.218 --> 44:38.637
Who owns the right to an American dream?

44:45.519 --> 44:49.439
Way to go, baby! Go, 25!

44:51.191 --> 44:52.359
Mi abuelo, Nicolàs,

44:52.442 --> 44:55.153
waved the Puerto Rican flag
when it was illegal to do that.

44:59.616 --> 45:00.826
He was locked up.

45:00.909 --> 45:02.911
But they could not lock up his pride.

45:02.995 --> 45:05.414
Who gets to determine
the value of someone's culture?

45:06.456 --> 45:07.833
And in this game we love,

45:08.625 --> 45:11.086
it was a Puerto Rican
who invented the three-point shot.

45:15.716 --> 45:18.385
And when I play, I honor him.

45:22.639 --> 45:27.227
Sometimes, it feels stuck-up
to think you can actually make it.

45:41.700 --> 45:42.784
Drew, run!

45:44.494 --> 45:46.455
There are as many people hoping I fail

45:46.538 --> 45:48.624
as there are people hoping I succeed.

45:50.292 --> 45:55.839
So I'll choose to be stuck-up.
'Cause it's on me to determine my destiny.

46:06.183 --> 46:08.310
We're all here for a reason.

46:20.531 --> 46:22.616
That is my American dream.

46:22.699 --> 46:24.493
I'm a basketball player.

46:24.576 --> 46:28.080
I'm from Puerto Rico.
And I am the American dream.

46:46.515 --> 46:49.184
-Jace? Boy, you did that whole thing.
-You see that?

46:49.268 --> 46:50.894
-Give me some. I'm saying.
-Know what I'm saying?

46:50.978 --> 46:51.979
Dude--

46:53.480 --> 46:55.858
I mean, never mind.

46:55.941 --> 46:56.942
What was that about?

46:57.651 --> 46:58.735
What's your problem?

47:00.612 --> 47:01.613
Excuse me.

47:14.835 --> 47:16.587
Nice game!

47:17.171 --> 47:19.006
You see my fourth quarter?

47:19.089 --> 47:21.049
No way they don't move me
back to number one.

47:21.133 --> 47:24.303
You got my vote. And number 21,
he had a good game too.

47:25.345 --> 47:26.763
-Nick Mendez.
-Hi. Good to meet you.

47:27.973 --> 47:29.892
-Are you kidding me?
-I'll call you.

47:31.059 --> 47:33.395
Hey, baby. Thank you, baby.

47:33.478 --> 47:35.439
Make you some steak
when we get home, okay?

47:35.522 --> 47:37.524
All right.
I'll wait in the car for you outside.

47:37.608 --> 47:39.067
You got it fixed already?

47:39.151 --> 47:40.277
Yeah, I got it fixed.

47:40.360 --> 47:42.446
You know you're the best mom
in the world, right?

47:42.529 --> 47:43.906
Yeah, I do.

47:43.989 --> 47:47.451
You know, you mighta had a better game
if we took care of that thumb.

47:49.286 --> 47:52.164
Don't think we not gonna discuss
that injury you keepin' from me.

47:52.247 --> 47:55.167
I just didn't want to give you
something else to worry about.

47:55.250 --> 47:58.587
Jace, you're my number one priority.

47:58.670 --> 48:01.381
And if you're hurt,
you need to be straight with me.

48:02.299 --> 48:03.926
-You got it?
-I got it.

48:04.009 --> 48:05.552
-Got it? Yeah.
-I got it.

48:05.636 --> 48:06.762
All right. You stink.

48:06.845 --> 48:09.932
Go get changed,
and we'll put some ice on that hand.

48:13.685 --> 48:14.686
Wait…

48:16.396 --> 48:17.397
So…

48:18.815 --> 48:20.526
that was Lester Davis's assistant.

48:22.277 --> 48:23.278
And so?

48:23.362 --> 48:26.114
So… yeah.

48:27.074 --> 48:28.408
Yeah.

48:30.077 --> 48:32.412
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

48:46.385 --> 48:48.720
What? No private dressing room
for the superstar?

48:49.555 --> 48:52.933
No. He hang with NBA players now.
He bougie.

48:53.016 --> 48:56.812
I put the team on my back, right?
Got us the win.

48:56.895 --> 48:58.397
We already had the win.

48:58.480 --> 49:00.566
You don't know that.

49:01.859 --> 49:03.569
Why are y'all trippin'?

49:05.696 --> 49:06.822
Musa.

49:08.365 --> 49:11.159
You know what, Jace?
That fourth quarter, man.

49:12.244 --> 49:13.620
That was real good lookin' out.

49:33.599 --> 49:35.184
How you feel about your game?

49:37.895 --> 49:39.813
Feel like that's a trick question.

49:41.273 --> 49:42.482
You stopped running my offense.

49:44.443 --> 49:47.446
My offense put up 16 points
in the fourth quarter.

49:47.529 --> 49:49.948
-And who did you make better?
-Not Nick Mendez.

49:50.032 --> 49:52.159
Not your team.

49:54.244 --> 49:57.331
If I lose, everyone says I suck.

49:57.414 --> 49:58.582
Now it's a problem when I win.

49:58.665 --> 50:00.375
Last game…

50:01.543 --> 50:02.711
you took over for your team.

50:02.794 --> 50:06.465
This game, you took over for your shine.

50:06.548 --> 50:08.800
You're a leader too dumb to lead,

50:08.884 --> 50:11.178
and if you keep this up,
nobody'll trust you.

50:11.261 --> 50:12.513
What kind of leader were you?

50:12.596 --> 50:14.223
We're not talkin' about me.

50:16.517 --> 50:18.560
You know, I figured you'd say that.

50:55.264 --> 50:58.934
You remember how my pops used to get
in our ear whenever we'd get out of line?

50:59.017 --> 51:01.270
-Man, of course I remember.
-Thank you, Barry.

51:02.688 --> 51:05.148
I tried the same thing with Jace.

51:06.900 --> 51:08.735
And he's as hardheaded as I was.

51:10.279 --> 51:11.572
The young king.

51:12.197 --> 51:14.366
The moment he realizes…

51:15.200 --> 51:16.326
what he got…

51:17.369 --> 51:19.162
I swear he gonna be better than all of us.

51:21.957 --> 51:23.917
I don't know. Maybe he do hear me.

51:25.002 --> 51:30.007
My pops never thought I listened,
but kinda wanted him to think that way.

51:31.592 --> 51:32.843
I heard every word.

51:32.926 --> 51:35.512
Well, I know you heard
every word that I said, and…

51:35.596 --> 51:37.097
a deal's a deal.

51:38.098 --> 51:40.225
I'm gonna double
your plumbing-store salary, Ike.

51:42.102 --> 51:44.146
-Can't be mad at that.
-Hey.

51:52.446 --> 51:54.281
There's one condition I forgot to mention.

51:56.450 --> 51:57.492
Yeah, what's that?

51:57.576 --> 51:58.869
I need you to apologize.

51:58.952 --> 52:00.495
-To who?
-To me.

52:01.330 --> 52:02.331
The hell for?

52:02.414 --> 52:04.208
For that shit you pulled at State.

52:05.501 --> 52:08.086
Ike, man, we was like brothers.
And you know this.

52:08.670 --> 52:09.755
Inseparable.

52:11.048 --> 52:12.633
But you broke my heart, man.

52:15.802 --> 52:17.387
Look, all I'm sayin' is,
for once in your life,

52:17.471 --> 52:19.223
I need you to own up to your own shit.

52:20.766 --> 52:22.351
I was debatin' whether or not…

52:22.976 --> 52:24.520
I come here today and…

52:25.771 --> 52:28.732
let my pride stop me
from doin' somethin' good for my players.

52:29.566 --> 52:30.901
I got a daughter on the way.

52:32.736 --> 52:34.821
I gotta figure out
what type of father I'm gonna be.

52:36.573 --> 52:39.493
Tonya, she think our daughter
gonna be a lawyer or somethin'.

52:39.576 --> 52:43.038
But I know she gonna be a athlete.

52:45.582 --> 52:46.583
But…

52:47.960 --> 52:48.961
ten…

52:50.003 --> 52:51.380
20 years from now…

52:54.508 --> 52:56.468
I don't want to explain to her,

52:57.386 --> 53:00.138
Jace, or anyone…

53:01.765 --> 53:04.101
why I went into business
with a asshole like you.

53:05.102 --> 53:06.728
Apologize to you?

53:09.189 --> 53:11.608
The only man I need to apologize to…

53:12.818 --> 53:14.361
is the man I buried.

53:28.584 --> 53:29.585
Icon.

53:31.128 --> 53:33.046
You gonna apologize one way or another,
brother.

53:34.173 --> 53:35.215
Promise you that.

54:55.128 --> 54:56.421
Oh, nah.
