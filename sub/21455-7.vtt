38:52.100 --> 38:53.870
I can´t even get out of bed.

38:55.330 --> 38:56.670
I hate that house.

39:00.730 --> 39:03.070
All right.

39:03.070 --> 39:05.100
It´s not you.

39:05.100 --> 39:06.170
Yeah.

39:09.170 --> 39:10.900
Whatever you want to do.

39:25.300 --> 39:26.600
Thanks for coming.

39:30.670 --> 39:32.730
Best I just show you.

39:39.130 --> 39:41.000
-Careful, it´s slippery.
-Yeah.

39:45.070 --> 39:47.500
-So you´re back on?
-Oh, yeah.

39:47.500 --> 39:50.570
Internal´s back in their cave.

39:50.570 --> 39:52.230
I saw you on TV.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.400
BEN: Who is he?

39:57.400 --> 40:00.630
Geraldo Michael Minelli.

40:03.970 --> 40:05.770
Late of Etobicoke.

40:08.670 --> 40:12.400
He´s the guy that wanted
to be king of Montreal.

40:12.400 --> 40:13.930
They know who killed him?

40:16.600 --> 40:19.770
Someone he trusted.

40:19.770 --> 40:21.400
Does it matter?

40:21.400 --> 40:23.730
He was a loose cannon
motherfucker.

40:23.730 --> 40:25.570
Bad for business.

40:25.570 --> 40:27.170
Once he went after you...

40:27.170 --> 40:30.730
Yeah. They cut him out.

40:30.730 --> 40:31.900
Like a cancer.

40:34.230 --> 40:36.270
Mob´s not a cancer.

40:36.930 --> 40:38.830
You can cure cancer.

40:39.770 --> 40:42.230
Mob´s a virus.

40:42.230 --> 40:46.430
And the best that you can do
is keep it under control.

40:50.800 --> 40:52.900
Welcome to Montreal.

41:05.300 --> 41:07.800
-Who are you?
-Lapointe. Organized Crime.

41:07.800 --> 41:09.330
-We´re taking the scene.
-All yours.

41:11.400 --> 41:15.230
-Hey, can I ask you something?
-Probably not.

41:15.230 --> 41:17.970
Why´d you leave me that night?

41:22.630 --> 41:23.870
Moral of the story,

41:23.870 --> 41:26.800
don´t start
sleeping with your boss.

41:30.070 --> 41:32.730
You sure you didn´t
take those drugs?

41:32.730 --> 41:34.830
Yeah, I´m sure.

42:09.970 --> 42:12.130
AMELIE: She always had a way of
making everything about herself.

42:18.300 --> 42:20.200
Even me.

42:53.200 --> 42:54.630
For you.

42:58.800 --> 43:00.770
My mom will kill me for that.
