WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:04.867
- THERE WERE GLADIATORS
AND RE-ENACTED SEA BATTLES HERE

00:04.867 --> 00:06.933
UNTIL THE 5th CENTURY!

00:06.933 --> 00:08.233
- HMM.

00:08.233 --> 00:09.833
- SO SHOULD WE GO SEE
THE FORUM NOW?

00:09.833 --> 00:12.400
- OH, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, I
COULD USE A LITTLE BREAK, MARIE.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.333
- BUT
IT'S RIGHT OVER THERE.

00:14.333 --> 00:17.100
- I KNOW, AND I REALLY WANT
TO GO SEE IT, BUT...

00:17.100 --> 00:20.533
- BUT IF WE DON'T STICK
TO MY SCHEDULE, WE WON'T SEE IT.

00:20.533 --> 00:23.367
AND WE DID STOP
FOR YOUR OTHER THING BEFORE.

00:23.367 --> 00:26.967
- MY OTHER THING BEFORE?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THE BATHROOM?

00:26.967 --> 00:28.700
- 40 MINUTES.

00:28.700 --> 00:31.500
- FIRST OF ALL,
YOU'RE TIMING ME NOW?

00:31.500 --> 00:34.000
AND SECOND OF ALL,
I DO NOT TAKE 40 MINUTES!

00:34.000 --> 00:36.800
- YES, DEAR, BUT WHEN YOU GO,
EVERYONE ELSE HAS TO GO.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.600
- OKAY, YOU KNOW, MARIE,

00:38.600 --> 00:42.100
IT'S JUST THAT I NEED A LITTLE
TIME TO MYSELF, THAT'S ALL.

00:42.100 --> 00:43.500
I MEAN, WE HAVE BEEN DOING

00:43.500 --> 00:46.233
EVERYTHING YOU'VE WANTED
TO DO, RIGHT?

00:46.233 --> 00:48.000
- ARE YOU SAYING
THAT YOU FEEL OBLIGATED

00:48.000 --> 00:49.333
BECAUSE I'M PAYING
FOR THIS TRIP?

00:49.333 --> 00:50.767
'CAUSE THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WANT.

00:50.767 --> 00:53.167
- NO, OF COURSE NOT.
AND I AM REALLY GRATEFUL.

00:53.167 --> 00:54.767
- REALLY?

00:54.767 --> 00:57.500
[laughs]

00:57.500 --> 00:59.033
- RAY...

00:59.033 --> 01:00.733
- NO COMMENT.

01:00.733 --> 01:02.700
- RAY, SAY SOMETHING.

01:02.700 --> 01:06.367
- I SAID SOMETHING. NO COMMENT.
- RAY...

01:06.367 --> 01:08.233
- WHAT, YOU WANT ME
TO SAY SOMETHING?

01:08.233 --> 01:10.267
I'LL SAY SOMETHING.
THIS IS WHAT YOU GET.

01:10.267 --> 01:12.400
OKAY? 'CAUSE I TOLD YOU
THAT IT WAS GONNA GET LIKE THIS.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.067
BUT CAN YOU EVER LISTEN
TO ME, HUH?

01:14.067 --> 01:16.567
NO, NO, NO, I'M JUST DUMB RAY
WHO LIKES NEW JERSEY.

01:16.567 --> 01:18.333
YOU KNOW, I WISH I WAS
IN NEW JERSEY RIGHT NOW,

01:18.333 --> 01:19.767
'CAUSE I SAW THIS COMING,
ALL RIGHT?

01:19.767 --> 01:21.667
I JUST DIDN'T THINK
IT WOULD TAKE SO LONG...

01:21.667 --> 01:22.933
OR I WOULD GET SICK

01:22.933 --> 01:25.567
FROM HOT AND THEN COLD
AND THEN HOT AND THEN COLD

01:25.567 --> 01:29.500
OR GET A MAMA LEONI HAND-WASH
OR HAVE TO SLEEP WITH MY FATHER!

01:29.500 --> 01:31.067
- OH, WHY DON'T YOU
STUFF IT, RAY?

01:31.067 --> 01:33.000
YOUR PARENTS ARE FINE
COMPARED TO YOU!

01:33.000 --> 01:35.333
- ME? ME? WHAT?
WHAT THE HELL DID I DO?

01:35.333 --> 01:36.733
- AT LEAST THEY'RE TRYING
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME!

01:36.733 --> 01:38.267
YOU'VE BEEN NOTHING
BUT A GRUMPY

01:38.267 --> 01:39.967
PAIN IN THE ASS
THE WHOLE TRIP.

01:39.967 --> 01:42.867
- DON'T FIGHT HERE.
IT'S THE COLOSSEUM.

01:42.867 --> 01:45.267
- I'M A PAIN IN THE ASS?
I'M A PAIN IN THE ASS?

01:45.267 --> 01:51.533
FINE! I WILL NOT BE A PAIN
IN ANYONE'S ASS ANYMORE!

01:52.867 --> 01:56.033
- AND I'M NOT SLEEPING
WITH YOU ANYMORE!

01:57.233 --> 01:59.700
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

02:04.567 --> 02:08.033
- HEY,
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

02:08.033 --> 02:12.633
- NOTHING, NOTHING, I'M JUST--
JUST READY TO GO HOME.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.433
THAT'S ALL.

02:14.433 --> 02:16.100
- OH.

02:22.067 --> 02:24.467
YOU GOT MORE LISTERINE?

02:28.300 --> 02:30.433
- I TOLD YOU
TO WEAR A HAT.

02:30.433 --> 02:32.300
WHY CAN'T YOU LISTEN
TO ME?

02:32.300 --> 02:33.933
- ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH!
I'M FINE!

02:33.933 --> 02:36.900
- YOU'RE FINE? YOU LOOK
LIKE THE TOP OF A POLICE CAR!

02:36.900 --> 02:38.700
PUT SOME CREAM ON THAT.
- NO!

02:38.700 --> 02:41.333
- FRANK, YOU PUT SOME CREAM
ON THAT HEAD RIGHT NOW.

02:41.333 --> 02:43.700
YOU'RE GONNA BE
IN PAIN LATER.

02:43.700 --> 02:46.100
- I'VE BEEN IN PAIN
SINCE THE WEDDING!

02:47.967 --> 02:51.667
- HE REFUSES TO ACCEPT THE FACT
THAT HE HAS NO HAIR.

02:51.667 --> 02:53.333
OH.

02:53.333 --> 02:57.800
WHAT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER, DEAR?

02:57.800 --> 02:59.600
- OH, EH, EH.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.300
- OH, I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

03:02.300 --> 03:05.100
IT'S DEBRA.

03:05.100 --> 03:06.400
- MA, PLEASE.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.800
- YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU AND I NEED?

03:08.800 --> 03:10.433
A NICE LONG WALK.

03:10.433 --> 03:13.500
THAT WOULD BE SO WONDERFUL,
WOULDN'T IT?

03:18.967 --> 03:20.567
- HEY, MA...

03:20.567 --> 03:23.367
DO YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE ANY
MOB CONNECTIONS HERE IN TOWN,

03:23.367 --> 03:25.200
BECAUSE I MIGHT NEED
A LITTLE HELP.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.567
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, DEAR?

03:26.567 --> 03:28.167
YOU LOOK SO TERRIBLE.
TUCK IN YOUR SHIRT.

03:28.167 --> 03:29.867
- NO, I'M FINE, MA.

03:29.867 --> 03:31.333
IT'S JUST THAT STEFANIA'S FATHER
WASN'T TOO THRILLED

03:31.333 --> 03:33.100
TO, UH, FIND ME
WITH HIS DAUGHTER.

03:33.100 --> 03:37.167
- WHAT?
- NOW, HE'S HAVING A VACATION.

03:37.167 --> 03:38.667
- THIS IS WILD, ISN'T IT?

03:38.667 --> 03:40.767
I WENT OUT THE WINDOW
WHEN POPS WENT TO GET A SHOVEL.

03:40.767 --> 03:44.300
- CONGRATULATIONS.
STEFANIA FOGAGNOLO.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.700
- OH, THANKS, THERE,
GIORGIO.

03:46.700 --> 03:50.700
- SIGNORE FOGAGNOLO,
HE WILL KILL YOU.

03:52.267 --> 03:54.800
- YOU BETTER STAY AWAY
FROM THAT GIRL, ROBBIE!

03:54.800 --> 03:56.600
- YEAH, RIGHT.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.767
NOTHING LIKE THIS
HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE.

03:58.767 --> 04:00.633
HEY, RAY,
YOU WANT TO GO GET A GELATO?

04:00.633 --> 04:02.133
- I'M NOT GOING THERE
WITH THAT FATHER.

04:02.133 --> 04:04.200
- COME ON.
- NO, GET OUT OF HERE.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.233
HE'LL USE ME
TO BEAT YOU TO DEATH.

04:06.233 --> 04:07.700
- COME ON, LOOK, HEY,

04:07.700 --> 04:10.567
MAYBE HE'LL CHASE US
WITH THE SHOVEL, HUH?

04:10.567 --> 04:12.367
COME ON. FRATELLO MIO,
E' COSI' BUONO--

04:12.367 --> 04:14.700
- GET OFF ME, YOU NUT.
I'M NOT GOING THERE.

04:14.700 --> 04:15.800
- HEY, HEY, HEY!

04:15.800 --> 04:17.667
YOU GOT TO WAKE UP, HERE,
LITTLE BRO!

04:17.667 --> 04:21.500
LOOK WHERE YOU ARE, MAN!
YOU'RE MISSING IT!

04:21.500 --> 04:26.733
[singing] LA DONNA MOBILE,
QUAL PIU MA VENTO

04:26.733 --> 04:31.033
- I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
LIKE THIS, SO HAPPY.

04:31.033 --> 04:33.733
I DON'T LIKE IT.

04:33.733 --> 04:35.800
- HI, DADDY.

04:35.800 --> 04:39.400
- HEY, WHAT DID YOU DO,
FEED THE DUCKS OR SOMETHING?

04:39.400 --> 04:40.867
- YOU WANT TO FEED THEM
WITH US TOMORROW?

04:40.867 --> 04:42.667
- YEAH, MAYBE.
I DON'T KNOW. WE'LL SEE.

04:42.667 --> 04:44.600
- YEAH, YEAH,
DADDY'S VERY BUSY, YOU GUYS.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.600
HE REALLY DOESN'T HAVE TIME
FOR FUN THIS TRIP.

04:46.600 --> 04:50.300
HE HAS A LOT OF MOPING TO DO,
WHICH IS QUITE TIME CONSUMING.

04:50.300 --> 04:52.100
- ALL RIGHT,
GIVE ME A BREAK, PLEASE.

04:52.100 --> 04:53.533
- WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE ME A BREAK, HUH?

04:53.533 --> 04:55.000
I THOUGHT
THAT THIS COULD BE

04:55.000 --> 04:56.600
A TIME FOR ALL OF US
TO BE TOGETHER!

04:56.600 --> 04:58.667
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
I CAN'T DO THIS RIGHT NOW,

04:58.667 --> 05:01.300
BECAUSE I JUST PROMISED
MY MOTHER WE'D TAKE A WALK.

05:04.967 --> 05:07.067
- THAT'S TRUE, DEAR.

05:08.867 --> 05:10.700
- HAVE A NICE TIME.

05:12.900 --> 05:15.933
- I'M SO GLAD
WE COULD DO THIS, RAYMOND.

05:15.933 --> 05:18.067
YOU REALLY SEEM
TO NEED IT.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.500
- NEED WHAT?

05:19.500 --> 05:22.833
- THIS, JUST THE TWO OF US
WALKING AND TALKING.

05:22.833 --> 05:25.500
YOU KNOW, WE NEVER GET
A CHANCE TO TALK.

05:25.500 --> 05:28.700
- WE DON'T?
- NO, NOT LIKE THIS.

05:28.700 --> 05:31.767
WE RARELY GET A CHANCE
TO JUST TALK--

05:31.767 --> 05:35.333
NO INTERRUPTIONS,
DISTRACTIONS, DEB--

05:35.333 --> 05:37.767
ANYWAY, FIRST OF ALL,

05:37.767 --> 05:40.567
I'M FEELING A LITTLE BIT UPSET
ABOUT SOMETHING.

05:40.567 --> 05:42.400
- THAT WATER
IS KIND OF NICE, HUH?

05:42.400 --> 05:43.967
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

05:43.967 --> 05:45.933
I'M FEELING THAT EVERYONE ELSE
SEEMS TO THINK

05:45.933 --> 05:47.433
THAT THEY HAVE
THE RIGHT TO DO

05:47.433 --> 05:50.233
JUST EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT
ON THIS TRIP.

05:50.233 --> 05:51.900
- AND THEY DON'T?

05:51.900 --> 05:53.700
- WELL, THEY DO.
OF COURSE THEY DO.

05:53.700 --> 05:56.500
BUT THEY COULD AT LEAST CONSULT
WITH ME FIRST...

05:56.500 --> 05:58.567
I KNOW, I KNOW,
HE'S YOUR FATHER.

05:58.567 --> 06:01.700
BETWEEN YOU AND ME,
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

06:01.700 --> 06:04.067
- HE SEEMED TO BE HAVING
A GOOD TIME.

06:04.067 --> 06:06.233
- WHAT, THIS MORNING?
THAT'S FINISHED.

06:06.233 --> 06:09.767
I HAD THE NERVE
TO TELL HIM TO WEAR A HAT...

06:09.767 --> 06:11.967
I BEGGED HIM 50 TIMES,

06:11.967 --> 06:15.400
"PLEASE, PLEASE, GET SOMEONE
TO FIX THE GARAGE DOOR."

06:15.400 --> 06:17.267
YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAYS?
"I CAN DO IT MYSELF."

06:17.267 --> 06:19.067
AND, OF COURSE,
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.

06:19.067 --> 06:22.400
HE DOESN'T DO IT.
HA, IT'S BEEN THREE MONTHS.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.500
ANYBODY COULD GET
INTO THAT GARAGE IF THEY WANTED.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.333
OH, PLEASE.

06:29.700 --> 06:31.567
WHAT ARE YOU STOPPING FOR?

06:31.567 --> 06:35.500
- NOTHING, NO, I JUST NEVER SEEN
THEM LIKE THIS BEFORE, HUH?

06:35.500 --> 06:36.733
PRETTY.

06:36.733 --> 06:39.267
YOU SEE THE WAY THEY WRAP THEM?
YOU LOOK AT THESE?

06:39.267 --> 06:40.700
- I'VE SEEN FLOWERS.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.500
MY POINT IS,
I CAN'T TALK TO HIM...

06:43.500 --> 06:45.467
OOH, THERE'S
A BUTCHER SHOP, HONEY.

06:45.467 --> 06:46.800
I GOT TO RUN IN THERE,
SEE,

06:46.800 --> 06:49.433
AND GET SOME MEAT
FOR THE BARBECUE LATER.

06:49.433 --> 06:50.567
YOU WANT TO COME IN
WITH ME?

06:50.567 --> 06:52.167
- NO, NO, NO.
GO, GO AHEAD.

06:52.167 --> 06:53.567
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

06:53.567 --> 06:55.633
AND DON'T FORGET
WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT.

06:55.633 --> 06:57.467
- OKAY.

07:19.800 --> 07:23.233
[boys speaking Italian]

07:25.200 --> 07:26.767
HERE, YOU GUYS.

07:26.767 --> 07:28.200
[boy speaking Italian]

07:28.200 --> 07:31.533
YOU WANT IT WITH THE FOOT?
OKAY.

07:33.333 --> 07:37.333
OH. WHAT, I'M IN IT?
HERE, THERE YOU GO.

07:37.333 --> 07:41.300
YOU WANT TO--WANT TO PLAY
A LITTLE GAME, HUH?

07:41.300 --> 07:43.567
[laughs] I'LL PASS IT.
THERE YOU GO.

07:43.567 --> 07:45.233
YOU GUYS ARE GOOD AT THIS.
I DON'T PLAY THIS.

07:45.233 --> 07:46.367
[boy speaking Italian]
YEAH.

07:46.367 --> 07:49.467
- ALESSANDRO! LUCA!

07:49.467 --> 07:51.367
- GRAZIE. ARRIVEDERCI.
- CIAO.

07:51.367 --> 07:52.467
- OKAY.

07:57.133 --> 07:59.467
- CIAO.
CIAO.

07:59.467 --> 08:01.667
- HEY, CIAO. YEAH.
HA.

08:16.333 --> 08:17.433
HEY.

08:17.433 --> 08:20.133
PIZZA.
- YES, PIZZA.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.767
- OKAY, GIVE ME ONE.
CAN I GET ONE?

08:26.800 --> 08:29.233
- HERE.
- YEAH. THANK YOU.

08:33.667 --> 08:35.600
WOW.

08:35.600 --> 08:36.967
- IT'S OKAY?

08:36.967 --> 08:39.300
- YEAH, YEAH.

08:39.300 --> 08:44.167
I HAD A COLD,
BUT IT'S--IT'S GONE NOW.

08:44.167 --> 08:45.667
THIS IS AWESOME.

08:45.667 --> 08:47.200
- HMM?

08:47.200 --> 08:49.500
- "AWESOME," "AWESOME."
YOU KNOW "AWESOME"?

08:49.500 --> 08:51.267
UH, MAGNIFICO.

08:51.267 --> 08:53.033
- OH, GRAZIE.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.633
- PREGO.

08:55.633 --> 08:58.567
OH, THIS IS, LIKE,
THE BEST PIZZA I EVER HAD, MAN!

08:58.567 --> 08:59.433
- YOU LIKE MORE?

08:59.433 --> 09:01.567
- HELL, YES, I WANT MORE!

09:01.567 --> 09:03.167
YOU MADE THIS?

09:03.167 --> 09:05.433
- I MAKE, YES.

09:05.433 --> 09:08.367
- SO YOU'RE, LIKE,
A GENIUS, THEN.

09:12.100 --> 09:14.700
- OH, ALL DONE.
[chuckles]

09:14.700 --> 09:17.000
OH, I'VE GOT
SOME CHOPS FOR LATER.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.600
WHAT--
YOU'RE HAVING PIZZA NOW?

09:19.600 --> 09:20.767
- YEAH, UH-HUH.

09:20.767 --> 09:22.533
- WILL YOU BE ABLE TO EAT
YOUR LUNCH?

09:22.533 --> 09:24.300
- YEAH, SURE.
YOU WANT A BITE?

09:24.300 --> 09:26.067
- NO, NO, NO.
- OH, GOOD.

09:26.067 --> 09:27.333
- COME ON.
- ALL RIGHT.

09:27.333 --> 09:30.367
- COME ON.
LET'S GO UP THIS WAY.

09:30.367 --> 09:32.633
[laughs]
I FORGOT WHAT I WAS SAYING.

09:32.633 --> 09:35.300
- HOW YOU CAN'T TALK
TO ANYONE BUT ME.

09:35.300 --> 09:36.900
- OH, YES, RIGHT.

09:36.900 --> 09:40.867
BECAUSE, I MEAN, NOBODY
VALUES COMMUNICATING ANYMORE.

09:40.867 --> 09:43.267
TO ME, THAT'S
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

09:43.267 --> 09:45.967
DON'T YOU AGREE WITH ME?
- MMM-HMM. ABSOLUTELY.

09:45.967 --> 09:48.433
- OH, RAYMOND,
THIS IS SO NICE.

09:48.433 --> 09:51.700
DID I TELL YOU THE OTHER THING
YOUR FATHER DID?

09:51.700 --> 09:53.467
- NO, GO AHEAD.

09:53.467 --> 09:57.400
- WELL, I HAD FORBID HIM
TO USE MY CUTTING BOARD...

10:02.300 --> 10:04.333
- HELLO, DEAR.
- HEY, MARIE.

10:04.333 --> 10:07.233
- HAVE YOU SEEN RAYMOND?
WHERE IS HE?

10:07.233 --> 10:08.833
- DON'T KNOW
AND DON'T CARE.

10:08.833 --> 10:10.633
HE'S BEEN A DRIP
THIS ENTIRE VACATION.

10:10.633 --> 10:13.233
I'VE DECIDED I'M NOT GONNA
LET HIM RUIN IT FOR ME.

10:13.233 --> 10:16.600

WITH HIM THIS MORNING.

10:16.600 --> 10:20.300
- IT'S SO NICE
THAT YOU TWO HAVE EACH OTHER.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.233
UGH, STUPID, STINKING HUMP!

I GOT A MILLION OF THEM.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.567
- UNBELIEVABLE.

10:35.567 --> 10:38.000
UNBELIEVABLE.

10:42.533 --> 10:45.833
[muffled]
SIGNORE FOGAGNOLO.

10:45.833 --> 10:48.400

12:04.700 --> 12:07.433
[bicycle bell dings]

12:07.433 --> 12:09.233

YOU CAN HAVE THOSE.

12:24.267 --> 12:26.433
HERE, YOU CAN HAVE
ONE OF THOSE.

12:26.433 --> 12:28.833
BEAUTIFUL.
SEE HOW THEY WRAP THEM?

12:28.833 --> 12:31.667
MOM...

12:31.667 --> 12:34.667
AND AUNT COLETTA!

12:34.667 --> 12:36.000
THESE ARE FOR YOU.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.500

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:37.500 --> 12:40.233
- YOU LOOK GOOD. COME HERE.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

12:40.233 --> 12:44.167
- WHAT?

12:44.167 --> 12:46.333
LISTEN...

12:46.333 --> 12:49.233
UM, I KNOW YOU WANTED TO TALK
TO ME BEFORE,

12:49.233 --> 12:51.100
AND I KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE GONNA SAY.

12:51.100 --> 12:52.533
- NO, YOU DON'T.

12:52.533 --> 12:54.233
- WHATEVER YOU WERE GONNA SAY,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

12:54.233 --> 12:55.833
I WAS WRONG,
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

12:55.833 --> 12:57.400
AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT

12:57.400 --> 12:59.767
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT IT ANYMORE LIKE AT HOME.

12:59.767 --> 13:01.933
IT'S JUST--THERE'S
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PLACE.

13:01.933 --> 13:03.267
DO YOU GET THAT?

13:03.267 --> 13:06.033
THERE'S, LIKE,
A FEELING HERE.

13:06.033 --> 13:08.300
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DESCRIBE IT,

13:08.300 --> 13:11.267
BUT IT'S MORE...SIMPLE.

13:11.267 --> 13:13.033
THE WAY THE WHOLE PLACE
SHUTS DOWN

13:13.033 --> 13:14.367
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY

13:14.367 --> 13:17.400
SO THE PEOPLE CAN JUST,
YOU KNOW, ENJOY THE DAY?

13:17.400 --> 13:19.900
IT'S LIKE THEY KNOW HOW TO LIVE
HERE, DON'T YOU THINK?

13:19.900 --> 13:23.667
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S KIND OF BEAUTIFUL HERE?

13:23.667 --> 13:25.333
- YES...

13:25.333 --> 13:27.000
- OKAY, SO WE AGREE.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.200
AND THE HISTORY--

13:28.200 --> 13:30.700
I WAS THINKING--
THOUSANDS OF YEARS HERE.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.567
WE GOT NO HISTORY AT HOME.

13:32.567 --> 13:35.633
EVERYTHING WAS BUILT
LAST WEEK.

13:35.633 --> 13:37.533
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

13:37.533 --> 13:39.300
- OH, I HAD A BIKE RIDE.
- NO, I--

13:39.300 --> 13:42.167
NOT TODAY.
I MEAN THIS WHOLE TRIP.

13:42.167 --> 13:45.633
- OKAY, SO WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO SAY?

13:45.633 --> 13:48.067
YOUR HAIR
DOES LOOK NICE, THOUGH.

13:48.067 --> 13:50.433
- SO NOW YOU'RE BEING
ROMANTIC?

13:50.433 --> 13:52.000
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M BEING,

13:52.000 --> 13:53.700
BUT WE GOT
A COUPLE OF DAYS LEFT.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.667
YOU WANT TO ENJOY IT,
OR YOU WANT TO MOPE AROUND?

16:04.567 --> 16:07.667
- OKAY, I THINK
THAT'S EVERYTHING.

16:09.400 --> 16:12.400
- [laughs]
OH, GOD.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.267
LOOK AT THIS.
- [laughing]

16:15.267 --> 16:17.067
- WHAT ARE YOU REBELLING
AGAINST?

16:17.067 --> 16:19.133
- WHAT DO YOU GOT?

16:19.133 --> 16:21.067
- YEAH, YOU SEE?
THEY RODE ONE.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.567
- THAT WAS FUN.

16:22.567 --> 16:25.233
- YEAH, I GOT TO GET
ONE OF THESE.

16:25.233 --> 16:26.800
ALL RIGHT,
FUN'S OVER, HERE.

16:26.800 --> 16:28.600
TIME TO GO HOME.

16:28.600 --> 16:31.333
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING,
THERE, GIORGIO.

16:36.100 --> 16:38.433
- ARRIVEDERCI, COLLETTA...

16:51.967 --> 16:54.800
- BENE, BENE.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.267
- AH.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.700

17:02.933 --> 17:04.833
- BYE-BYE.

17:04.833 --> 17:07.767
LISTEN, ANYTIME YOU WANT TO COME
TO AMERICA AND GIVE ME A SHOWER,

17:07.767 --> 17:10.900
IT'S FINE WITH ME.

17:10.900 --> 17:13.400
GIORGIO,

17:18.733 --> 17:22.033
NO, NOTHING, IT'S--

17:56.667 --> 17:58.900

17:58.900 --> 18:01.833

18:08.133 --> 18:09.800
- I WILL MISS YOU.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.633

18:11.633 --> 18:15.633
MAYBE YOU CAN COME AND VISIT ME
IN AMERICA SOMETIME.

18:19.600 --> 18:23.800
BRING YOUR FATHER ALONG
FOR LAUGHS.

18:23.800 --> 18:27.067
- HERE, FOR YOU.

18:27.067 --> 18:30.000
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PAY ME.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.400
- YOU THROW A COIN
IN THE WATER.

18:32.400 --> 18:35.667
IT MEANS SOME DAY YOU RETURN
TO LAGO DI BRACCIANO.

18:35.667 --> 18:38.233
YOU WOULD LIKE THAT?

18:38.233 --> 18:39.767
