00:01.042 --> 00:02.919
(Tessa)
With the right attitude,
a bad breakup

00:02.961 --> 00:04.629
can turn into a fresh start.

00:04.671 --> 00:07.007
Post Ryan, I was doing great
and looking better

00:07.048 --> 00:08.633
if I do say so myself.

00:08.675 --> 00:11.011
After all, being single
is what you make it

00:11.052 --> 00:13.471
and I was making it my bitch.

00:15.265 --> 00:19.144
Unfortunately,
George was another matter.

00:19.185 --> 00:21.062
What are you eating?

00:21.104 --> 00:23.565
hamburger.

00:23.606 --> 00:25.358
Functioning people
hamburgers

00:25.400 --> 00:27.777
before 9 a.m.

00:27.819 --> 00:30.488
They also don't go outside
in their pajamas.

00:30.530 --> 00:34.159
So? It's not like
I'm trying to impress anyone.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.244
Yeah. No risk of that.

00:36.286 --> 00:37.912
Hey.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.289
If I wanna walk
the drive-through

00:39.330 --> 00:41.541
for a breakfast burger,
so be it.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.128
- Burger, please.
- 'I'm sorry, sir.'

00:45.170 --> 00:46.963
(female #1)
'But we're
still serving breakfast.'

00:47.005 --> 00:49.924
'You can order anything on the
left side of the menu board.'

00:52.302 --> 00:53.678
'Anything at all.'

00:53.720 --> 00:55.013
[car honks]

00:56.973 --> 00:58.683
Burger, please.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.144
Let that be
a lesson to you, Tessa.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.605
If you hold up the drive-through
line long enough

01:03.646 --> 01:04.981
you can change the world.

01:05.023 --> 01:07.067
How long till you
change your clothes?

01:07.108 --> 01:09.569
I'm a bachelor, baby. I'm free!

01:09.611 --> 01:12.322
This is what freedom looks like,
right here.

01:12.363 --> 01:15.742
Oh, so freedom has pit stains?

01:15.784 --> 01:18.620
Nobody said freedom was pretty.
Have you seen Syria lately?

01:20.580 --> 01:21.873
George doesn't wanna admit it

01:21.915 --> 01:23.666
but his behavior
is a direct result

01:23.708 --> 01:25.210
of his breakup with Dallas.

01:25.251 --> 01:27.003
When a long-term
relationship ends

01:27.045 --> 01:28.671
people tend to freak out.

01:28.713 --> 01:29.839
After Malik and I split

01:29.881 --> 01:33.760
I spent a lot of time
in car washes

01:33.802 --> 01:36.346
more time
than I'm comfortable admitting.

01:36.387 --> 01:39.682
Nobody knows better than me
about epic breakups.

01:39.724 --> 01:43.436
I get it. I just wish George
would follow my lead.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.647
After all, I am doing great

01:45.688 --> 01:48.108
and looking better

01:48.149 --> 01:50.401
if I do say so myself.

01:50.443 --> 01:51.653
I guess
it's easier for me, though

01:51.694 --> 01:54.030
because I'm completely
over Ryan.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.406
Completely?

01:55.448 --> 01:57.909
- Totally.
- Good.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.536
(Sheila)
Because Ryan is coming home

01:59.577 --> 02:02.580
I'll need you to sweep the attic
from top to bottom, Lisa.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.499
Use my good broom.

02:04.541 --> 02:07.127
I doubt Ryan will be
going up to the attic.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.337
Oh, but he could, he could.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.339
So it needs to be RR.

02:12.173 --> 02:13.842
Ryan ready.

02:13.883 --> 02:16.052
Your father is out
buying driveway sealants

02:16.094 --> 02:19.764
so Ryan makes a smooth entry.
That is done.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.891
Oh, and I have made a chart

02:21.933 --> 02:24.227
with everyone's
sleeping arrangements.

02:24.269 --> 02:28.148
Victor, Ryan will be
sleeping with you

02:28.189 --> 02:29.482
like a couple of real brothers.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.568
I actually have a real brother.

02:31.609 --> 02:34.654
He was left behind in Cambodia.

02:34.696 --> 02:37.198
Fred will be bunking down in
the rumpus room on the pullout.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.742
Well, why can't he just
sleep in his bed?

02:39.784 --> 02:42.996
Because, ding-dong,
Ryan's new girlfriend is coming

02:43.037 --> 02:44.581
and she'll be
sleeping in with me

02:44.622 --> 02:46.082
so I can keep an eye on her.

02:46.124 --> 02:47.709
Ryan has a girlfriend?

02:47.750 --> 02:50.128
And heaven has angels.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.547
His gal pal will be locked
in my sleep chamber

02:52.589 --> 02:55.466
with the only key
tucked safe and sound

02:55.508 --> 02:58.511
in my prison purse.

02:58.553 --> 03:01.848
Your father bought it for me on
our honeymoon trip to Alcatraz.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.267
I usually keep my tampons in it.

Allow me. I see you have

I'm-I'm watching
the Chilean mine disaster.

need to stay above ground.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.218
No, no, the same one.

I didn't have time to follow it
when it first happened

03:45.058 --> 03:46.726
They do get out, right?

- He's a puller!

- I know. Sorry.
- Hell, no.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.817
[chuckles]
He looks like Howdy Doody.

03:54.859 --> 03:57.320
I recommend walking him
more regularly on pavement.

03:57.362 --> 04:00.657
It's gonna keep his nails under
control in between groomings.

04:00.698 --> 04:02.867
Uh-huh.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.869
Monique had a difficult time
clipping his nails.

as long and thick.

I brought you some shards
so you could see.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.712
That's very thoughtful of you.
Thank you.

04:14.754 --> 04:17.257
To be honest,
his condition alarms me.

04:17.298 --> 04:20.468
There's considerable matting.
His ears are waxy.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.428
I wouldn't be surprised
if there was a flea infestation.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.972
I-I-I don't, I don't understand.

04:24.013 --> 04:26.391

He-he looks great.

- I'm talking about your dad.
- Oh. Yep.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.438
Do you mind my asking? What's
his feeding schedule like?

04:32.480 --> 04:35.275
Oh, we just have
an open-bowl policy.

04:35.316 --> 04:37.068
I'm not sure that's best.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.653
In my opinion,
he's overindulging

04:38.695 --> 04:40.238
and not getting enough exercise.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.156
Okay, I'll try to walk him more

04:42.198 --> 04:44.367

he is terrible on the leash.

that out is to check his stool.

but, uh...leave the door open,
will you?

19:03.517 --> 19:04.893
Just a crack.

19:04.935 --> 19:06.186
And if love comes a-knocking

19:06.228 --> 19:08.355
don't be afraid to answer.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.648
Deal.

19:18.615 --> 19:21.743
I thought we agreed you were
gonna leave the door open.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.579
I thought that was a metaphor.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.330
You want me
to leave my actual door--

19:25.372 --> 19:26.665
Well, no, I guess you're right

19:26.707 --> 19:27.958
but if someone comes knocking--

19:28.000 --> 19:29.626
No, I-I got it.

19:31.628 --> 19:32.880
[knocking on door]

19:34.298 --> 19:35.757
Okay, that was a test.
You passed.

19:35.799 --> 19:37.551
- Goodbye, dad.
- Goodbye.

19:39.469 --> 19:40.804
[knocking on door]

19:40.846 --> 19:43.098
Okay, this is getting
ridiculous.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.141
- Oh.
- Oh.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.434
- Hi.
- Hello.

19:46.727 --> 19:50.480
I'm just..
I'm here picking up.

19:50.522 --> 19:51.899
Your dog.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.193
- For his walk.
- Oh, right. Yeah.

19:54.234 --> 19:56.945
Biederman. Come here.

19:56.987 --> 20:01.116
Alrighty. You ready to go on
your walk? Here you go.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.744
You're, uh,
looking very dapper today.

20:03.785 --> 20:05.370
Oh, thank you.

20:07.456 --> 20:08.999
You know what?
I could use some fresh air.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.293
- You mind if I join you?
- Oh, that'd be great.

20:11.335 --> 20:13.086
I can show you
some of my on-leash corrections

20:13.128 --> 20:14.546
and you can be the bag man.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.173
I am not gonna ask
what that means

20:16.215 --> 20:18.175
'cause I think I already know.

20:19.843 --> 20:22.804
[indistinct chattering on TV]

20:22.846 --> 20:24.181
Hey, did you know

20:24.223 --> 20:27.351
it was over a 90 degrees
underground?

20:27.392 --> 20:29.186
Not to mention the humidity.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.772
Having some morning ice cream?

20:31.813 --> 20:33.357
It's so good. You want some?

20:33.398 --> 20:34.775
No. Thank you.

20:36.485 --> 20:40.030
I, uh, I ran into Ryan outside.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.907
Guess he's back for a visit.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.618
Mm. Guess so.

20:47.955 --> 20:50.624
Look, Tessa,
I know how you feel

20:50.666 --> 20:52.793
but the less time
you spend on the couch

20:52.834 --> 20:54.836
the better.

20:54.878 --> 20:57.839
And I'm not just saying that
'cause it's a beautiful day out

20:57.881 --> 21:01.093
but also because
it could truly use a cleaning

21:01.134 --> 21:02.552
after the spill.

21:04.638 --> 21:07.224
- What spill?
- I-I didn't have an accident.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.769
But my stadium buddy did.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.274
I think I'm gonna go shower.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.320
It's not exactly true,
but she's my kid

21:20.362 --> 21:21.947
and I wanna see her happy.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.033
You know what?
I can't take your judgment.

21:25.075 --> 21:26.827
Go lay down on your mat.

21:26.868 --> 21:29.830
