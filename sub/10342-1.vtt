WEBVTT

00:22.565 --> 00:27.486
<i>It has been 18 years since
the death of my beloved Li Mu Bai.</i>

00:30.030 --> 00:33.367
<i>In that time,
the followers of the Iron Way</i>

00:33.451 --> 00:36.495
<i>have become few and far between.</i>

00:40.082 --> 00:44.044
<i>Warring clans now vie for power
over the Martial World.</i>

00:47.256 --> 00:51.719
<i>It is into this world
that I hope to slip unnoticed...</i>

00:54.054 --> 00:56.348
<i>like a forgotten ghost.</i>

01:35.220 --> 01:38.307
<i>It is said that a scholar's name will last</i>

01:38.390 --> 01:41.310
<i>for five years beyond his passing...</i>

01:42.812 --> 01:46.315
<i>and a swordsman will be remembered for 20.</i>

01:49.861 --> 01:52.404
<i>This is meant as praise...</i>

01:56.075 --> 01:58.118
<i>but I believe it to be a curse.</i>

04:44.785 --> 04:47.163
Well, what have we here?

04:47.246 --> 04:50.124
This girl claims
she wants to join our ranks.

04:50.208 --> 04:53.085
The guards found her at the temple gate.

05:05.139 --> 05:06.265
What brings you here?

05:06.348 --> 05:09.143
I seek Hades Dai of the West Lotus.

05:09.227 --> 05:12.021
A man great enough
to rule the Martial World.

05:12.104 --> 05:15.607
And now you have found him.
What would you ask of me?

05:53.645 --> 05:54.730
Let her go!

05:54.813 --> 05:57.858
Let her grow into someone worth killing.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.546
<i>Wei-Fang.</i>

06:34.312 --> 06:35.395
Show yourself!

06:39.775 --> 06:40.901
Who are you?

06:40.985 --> 06:42.402
Ask her.

06:42.486 --> 06:44.529
Wei-Fang.

06:57.126 --> 06:58.543
Who are you?

06:58.627 --> 07:03.507
Bring me to Lord Dai and I will give him
a prize greater than the one he sought.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.644
Master Yu has arrived, sir.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.230
Shu Lien.

08:42.313 --> 08:43.648
You brighten a sad day.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.819
I've ensured your old quarters
were kept for you.

08:47.903 --> 08:49.196
I knew you would come.

08:49.280 --> 08:52.491
You were not the only one.
I was attacked along the way.

08:53.242 --> 08:55.744
Two dozen swordsmen slain
since my father passed.

08:55.827 --> 09:00.958
Hades Dai knows no fear
to attack a warrior as great as you.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.281
I'm sorry you were put at risk.

09:02.334 --> 09:06.671
It is my duty to be here,
to share your family's loss.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.299
Our loss.

09:08.382 --> 09:11.302
My father always regarded you as family.

09:14.179 --> 09:15.722
It is not kept hidden.

09:15.806 --> 09:19.143
In his last year,
my father wanted it where he could see it.

09:19.226 --> 09:22.938
It reminded him of more noble days.

09:51.342 --> 09:53.927
It bears so many sorrows.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.099
One above all.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.977
<i>Li Mu Bai.</i>

10:02.060 --> 10:04.771
<i>I was his student when you were both here.</i>

10:06.524 --> 10:09.067
<i>His death touched us all.</i>

10:10.652 --> 10:14.323
My father, he thought you would wed.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.536
We could not.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.120
I was promised to another.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.835
It should be locked away.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.256
<i>A great lord has died,</i>

10:31.340 --> 10:33.758
and you seek to use
this time of chaos

10:33.842 --> 10:37.262
to emerge as the one true leader
of the Martial World.

10:37.346 --> 10:40.265
- Do you read my mind?
- No. Your ambition.

10:41.058 --> 10:43.602
This sword is great,

10:43.685 --> 10:46.646
but there is one greater.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.315
The Green Destiny.

10:53.820 --> 10:57.282
The Green Destiny
was lost long years ago.

10:57.366 --> 11:00.536
Not lost. Hidden.

11:00.619 --> 11:03.121
Kept by the House of Te.

11:03.205 --> 11:06.166
Am I to storm the home
of the Emperor's brother?

11:06.958 --> 11:12.797
Send instead a single drop of rain.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.926
The boy...

11:16.801 --> 11:19.054
who crawled home from failure?

11:19.137 --> 11:22.057
The fault is not Wei-Fang's alone.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.476
His training is not complete.

11:24.560 --> 11:28.313
To send him on this mission alone
would be suicide.

11:28.397 --> 11:30.732
- Perhaps I can...
- He brought me to you.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.568
Send the boy.

11:32.651 --> 11:34.945
He and the sword are bound by fate.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.115
I have seen it.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.755
Who is that young lady?

12:37.215 --> 12:40.051
I believe the daughter of an official.

12:40.135 --> 12:43.221
Many have come to pay their respects.

14:06.388 --> 14:07.639
Shh!

15:33.975 --> 15:35.602
Thief! Thief in the house!

15:49.616 --> 15:50.659
Who is this man?

15:51.451 --> 15:52.786
I heard a disturbance.

15:52.870 --> 15:54.872
He was trying to steal the sword.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.623
I was trying to steal...?

15:58.792 --> 16:00.585
We caught the thief.

16:00.669 --> 16:02.295
He is more than a thief.

16:02.379 --> 16:05.549
He is West Lotus.
He attacked my carriage.

16:09.135 --> 16:12.639
- Take him to the Marshal.
- No. Keep him here.

16:12.723 --> 16:16.560
Hades Dai would not
assign this mission lightly.

16:16.643 --> 16:20.480
If the boy has value to him,
he may yet have value to us.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.483
Very well.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.777
Confine him and secure the compound.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.342
What will happen to him? The boy?

16:49.426 --> 16:50.802
Who are you?

16:50.886 --> 16:52.679
I am called Snow Vase.

16:53.471 --> 16:56.099
I came to pay my respects to Sir Te.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.268
And your concern for the thief?

16:59.060 --> 17:02.272
You mistake curiosity for concern.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.866
Is it as powerful as they say?

17:16.744 --> 17:18.329
In the right hand.

17:52.322 --> 17:53.406
Teach me.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.366
You have been well taught already.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.663
I want to learn more.

18:00.914 --> 18:03.792
I want to walk the path you followed.

18:10.465 --> 18:13.760
I will serve you for life.

18:16.805 --> 18:19.223
I don't need a servant, Snow Vase.

18:19.307 --> 18:23.061
My life is solitude,
and I return to it shortly.

18:23.144 --> 18:26.105
If you seek a teacher,
you must look elsewhere.

18:46.334 --> 18:48.753
Did a night in the cold
loosen your tongue?

18:48.837 --> 18:50.797
Open this cage and I'll loosen your teeth.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.635
That's enough!

19:01.391 --> 19:03.518
- What is your name?
- Wei-Fang.

19:05.144 --> 19:09.190
So, Hades Dai wants the sword.

19:11.359 --> 19:15.030
Let me leave with the sword now
and you'll be spared.

19:15.113 --> 19:17.532
Otherwise, this house
will swim with blood.

19:20.077 --> 19:21.828
Word must be sent
to the Emperor.

19:21.912 --> 19:24.288
There is war in the south.

19:24.372 --> 19:28.167
I cannot trouble him
with these underworld affairs.

19:28.251 --> 19:30.670
The Emperor doesn't heed my words
as he did my father's.

19:30.754 --> 19:33.548
The sword must be removed
from here at once.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.133
It is safest here, Shu Lien.

19:35.216 --> 19:38.261
Nothing is safe
if West Lotus claims that sword.

19:38.344 --> 19:41.472
It must be taken to Wudang Temple,
high up in the mountains.

19:41.556 --> 19:44.142
No. I made an oath to my father

19:44.225 --> 19:47.687
that I would guard and protect
the Green Destiny within these walls.

19:47.771 --> 19:50.065
Sir Te would understand.

19:50.148 --> 19:54.318
You've earned your place in this house
and much respect beyond.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.613
Only from you, Shu Lien.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.448
It was always that way.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.283
Then listen to me now.

20:00.366 --> 20:04.788
If Hades Dai comes here,
he'll leave nothing standing.

20:04.871 --> 20:08.249
No one alive.
We have no choice.

20:09.042 --> 20:14.338
The promise that I made my father
is all I have to earn honor in this house.

20:15.339 --> 20:17.926
It is worth my life, Shu Lien.

20:20.303 --> 20:22.097
We must ask the guests to leave.

20:24.432 --> 20:28.436
Will you stay? You always came
to my father's aid and he to yours.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.355
Will you help?

20:34.275 --> 20:36.360
I will stay as long as I am needed.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.405
I will bid the guests to leave.

20:39.489 --> 20:41.866
Keep the girl who caught the thief.

20:41.950 --> 20:44.285
She has asked me to teach her...

20:45.120 --> 20:47.872
but I suspect she can teach us.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.001
We will need more arms.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.294
I will hire extra guards.

20:53.377 --> 20:56.923
We need those who will do more than guard.

20:57.007 --> 21:01.469
<i>There are warriors who once stood against
this type of injustice.</i>

21:03.596 --> 21:07.266
<i>True followers will still answer the call.</i>

21:07.350 --> 21:10.478
<i>The Iron Way is not legend...</i>

21:10.561 --> 21:12.355
<i>not yet.</i>

21:55.481 --> 21:56.900
I'm telling you, I'm good for it.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.027
You are good for nothing.

22:46.241 --> 22:48.201
We're good for your warrant.

22:48.285 --> 22:53.123
I have 30 swords
at 20 ounces of silver a head.

22:53.206 --> 22:54.707
That's...

22:54.791 --> 22:59.045
six hundred ounces of silver...
wasted.

23:00.213 --> 23:03.633
Sir Te was honored
by masters of pen and sword alike.

23:03.716 --> 23:08.471
If his house has need, men of the Iron Way
should heed for the honor of his cause,

23:08.554 --> 23:10.723
not promise of riches.

23:10.807 --> 23:12.725
My friend is right.

23:13.643 --> 23:16.104
This warrant is not for you.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.524
And if I say it is?

23:46.092 --> 23:47.927
Think about it.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.348
They're not that fast.

23:52.307 --> 23:56.435
Big words for a little man...
all alone.

23:56.519 --> 23:57.520
He's not alone.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.024
I stand with him.

24:01.107 --> 24:05.028
Flying Blade of Shantung,
at your service.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.697
As am I.

24:09.573 --> 24:12.327
Thunder Fist Chan, famed in Zhejiang.

24:13.077 --> 24:14.996
And I,

24:15.079 --> 24:17.081
Silver Dart Shi.

24:17.165 --> 24:19.125
Famed in Fuzhou.

24:20.126 --> 24:23.421
And I, Turtle Ma.

24:23.504 --> 24:26.924
Famed in... this tavern.

25:31.489 --> 25:32.907
Yahh!

26:52.820 --> 26:54.697
Ahh!

27:13.883 --> 27:15.009
- Huh?
- Hm.

27:15.092 --> 27:17.136
Huh?

27:25.769 --> 27:27.980
Who are you?

27:29.357 --> 27:31.568
I'm known as Silent Wolf.

27:33.736 --> 27:36.364
We'll have to rebuild
all the tables!

27:37.574 --> 27:39.200
Who threatens the House of Te?

27:39.909 --> 27:41.369
West Lotus.

27:41.452 --> 27:43.746
I need swords to protect its walls.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.456
Now you have four more.

27:45.540 --> 27:48.918
- To add to your army.
- How many, in your army?

27:49.001 --> 27:50.961
- Five.
- Hundred?

27:51.045 --> 27:52.463
Five.

27:56.593 --> 27:59.596
Well, better five that can fight
than 500 that can run.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.014
I need a drink.

28:07.228 --> 28:11.190
On the house. Never come back.

29:00.906 --> 29:03.075
Let the training begin.

29:09.790 --> 29:14.420
Do not just watch with your eyes,
listen with your mind.

29:17.923 --> 29:19.216
Again.

29:24.221 --> 29:26.015
Again.

29:28.809 --> 29:30.478
Your curiosity with the boy...

29:30.561 --> 29:32.480
I'm not curious.

29:32.563 --> 29:34.732
Then what do I now mistake for curiosity?

29:36.066 --> 29:37.151
Hopeless!

29:37.234 --> 29:38.402
Irritation.

29:39.529 --> 29:41.822
- Must we train here?
- Yes.

29:41.905 --> 29:44.575
True skill is not a blazing flame.

30:05.680 --> 30:06.930
Again.

30:07.515 --> 30:08.849
Too much blazing flame!

30:08.932 --> 30:10.809
This does not concern you!

30:18.484 --> 30:20.570
A thousand
broken sticks and swords

30:20.653 --> 30:23.989
won't teach as much
as the one that bends to your will.

30:29.036 --> 30:32.498
- Touch me, however you can.
- Or me!

30:32.582 --> 30:35.125
Ignore him. Strike me.

30:40.757 --> 30:43.175
The predictable attack
has a predictable outcome.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.512
Again.

30:56.021 --> 30:57.523
Keep practicing.

30:59.316 --> 31:00.401
Be unpredictable.

31:05.448 --> 31:07.533
Light Body Skill.

31:07.617 --> 31:09.118
Where did you learn that?

31:09.201 --> 31:12.246
My teacher. She taught me.

31:12.329 --> 31:15.874
So, your teacher was a woman.

31:19.086 --> 31:20.421
What is her name?

31:22.339 --> 31:23.800
You would not know it.

31:25.843 --> 31:27.886
And why do you no longer study with her?

31:42.901 --> 31:44.278
She died.

31:45.028 --> 31:46.196
Years ago.

31:48.699 --> 31:49.700
I see.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.874
I will practice.

31:56.957 --> 31:59.001
Your patience will be rewarded.

32:17.478 --> 32:18.896
Perhaps you need a bigger hole.

32:20.230 --> 32:23.693
Like your mouth,
which is always open.

32:23.776 --> 32:25.194
I could try that.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.529
You could try...

32:26.612 --> 32:28.698
Or you could let me go.

32:31.450 --> 32:34.161
Let you go? So you can thieve again?

32:34.244 --> 32:37.956
Bring your spoils
to that monster Hades Dai?

32:38.040 --> 32:40.376
Lord Dai is a great warrior.

32:40.459 --> 32:43.838
Under his hand,
the Martial World will be peaceful.

32:44.505 --> 32:47.090
Your master is a murderer.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.488
Ah, Thunder Fist Chan.

33:09.572 --> 33:12.199
Things must be quite dire for you
to pledge your sword

33:12.282 --> 33:15.327
for five measly taels of silver.

33:15.411 --> 33:17.705
No gold convoys going out this season?

33:17.788 --> 33:20.583
I was protecting that convoy from raiders,

33:20.666 --> 33:22.668
raiders that you hired out to.

33:25.462 --> 33:29.174
How these southern boxers from Zhejiang
retell history when it suits them.

33:29.258 --> 33:31.093
You mock Zhejiang, do you?

33:31.176 --> 33:34.221
Easy, boys.
We have all been hired for the same cause.

33:35.222 --> 33:37.433
But does anyone know what that is exactly?

33:38.434 --> 33:40.554
All the wine we can drink?

33:40.603 --> 33:42.479
I didn't hear that part, Ma.

33:42.563 --> 33:45.315
It was implied.

33:55.367 --> 33:58.579
I heard whispers that it's kept there.

33:58.662 --> 34:00.497
In the House of Te.

34:01.916 --> 34:03.417
The Green Destiny.

34:05.962 --> 34:07.797
The blade was forged...

34:07.880 --> 34:11.132
Forged with a technique
that dates back to the Qin era.

34:11.216 --> 34:13.302
A technique lost to history.

34:13.385 --> 34:18.389
A blade that could carve through
Damascus steel.

34:19.181 --> 34:23.728
Nobody who was wielding the blade
was ever defeated in a duel or battle.

34:25.856 --> 34:28.900
Silent Wolf, is this true?

34:28.985 --> 34:30.694
Are we being hired to guard a sword?

34:33.614 --> 34:35.949
I wonder how he got his name.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.028
I bid you welcome.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.186
Excuse me.

36:13.338 --> 36:16.800
Explain how a man returns from the dead.

36:18.719 --> 36:20.596
We were to wed.

36:21.889 --> 36:23.891
I mourned for you.

36:29.438 --> 36:31.189
Shu Lien...

36:31.273 --> 36:34.234
That name is not yours to speak.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.785
I was dead before that duel.

36:43.827 --> 36:45.746
Long before.

36:46.872 --> 36:50.167
I did it for you and Li Mu Bai.

36:54.004 --> 36:57.549
I knew you loved him, not me.

37:06.183 --> 37:09.645
<i>When Hades Dai and I
fought on Vulture's Peak...</i>

37:14.191 --> 37:16.234
<i>...I took the only path I could see.</i>

37:19.404 --> 37:20.823
Ahh!

37:32.835 --> 37:36.088
Hades Dai left me for dead.

37:44.888 --> 37:47.516
<i>I made my way to the mountains,</i>

37:47.599 --> 37:50.060
<i>and chose a life of solitude.</i>

37:51.979 --> 37:57.109
<i>Up there... I found
what Mu Bai and I had strived for...</i>

37:58.443 --> 38:00.112
<i>detachment...</i>

38:01.404 --> 38:03.740
<i>enlightenment.</i>

38:11.665 --> 38:17.087
<i>I stayed away because I knew
that as long as I was alive,</i>

38:17.171 --> 38:19.215
<i>Mu Bai would not ask you to marry him.</i>

38:19.297 --> 38:21.675
Nor in your death.

38:22.425 --> 38:25.095
Such was his honor.

38:25.179 --> 38:26.972
You feigned your death for nothing.

38:29.016 --> 38:30.809
It wasn't feigned.

38:34.271 --> 38:36.106
It was deeply felt.

38:36.190 --> 38:40.485
That was your choice,
and you made it for all of us.

38:44.698 --> 38:49.036
I have made peace with your passing,
and so it will remain.

38:51.872 --> 38:55.125
You are needed and you're here.

38:55.209 --> 38:58.378
Your skill and courage are not forgotten.

39:00.463 --> 39:02.299
All else is.

39:22.194 --> 39:23.528
And you are?

39:24.196 --> 39:25.572
Snow Vase.

39:25.655 --> 39:28.284
Student of Master Yu Shu Lien.

39:31.411 --> 39:34.081
I have not known her to take a student.

39:34.164 --> 39:35.291
So you know her well.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.833
Well enough.

39:36.917 --> 39:38.210
How?

39:41.630 --> 39:43.966
This is not the place for story.

39:49.596 --> 39:51.598
Another time, then.

39:54.310 --> 39:56.145
Your teacher...

39:58.521 --> 39:59.606
is she content?

39:59.689 --> 40:01.150
She's in mourning.

40:02.192 --> 40:03.693
Of course.

40:04.820 --> 40:06.488
I do not speak just of Sir Te.

40:50.032 --> 40:52.117
You move as quietly as ever.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.372
Not so quiet that you will not hear.

40:58.498 --> 40:59.791
You have taken a student.

41:00.458 --> 41:01.793
Yes.

41:03.337 --> 41:07.590
They are connected somehow,
she and that boy.

41:10.135 --> 41:14.514
He roars, but I feel a gentle soul
may sleep within.

41:15.140 --> 41:19.019
- And your student?
- I am not certain.

41:19.102 --> 41:20.937
I see darkness in her eyes.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.691
<i>She could be an even greater threat.</i>

41:24.774 --> 41:26.484
To us...

41:27.777 --> 41:29.654
or those we guard against?

41:29.738 --> 41:31.240
Time will tell.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.831
Her teacher may have been Han Mei,

41:39.915 --> 41:43.001
the renegade swordswoman
from Willow Valley.

41:44.336 --> 41:46.088
She's gone many years.

41:46.755 --> 41:49.674
So she taught Snow Vase quite young.

41:50.717 --> 41:51.760
Too young.

42:44.062 --> 42:45.897
Mm!

42:45.981 --> 42:47.565
Miss Snow Vase?

42:47.649 --> 42:50.527
- Raise a cup with us.
- Yes, come in.

42:50.610 --> 42:53.863
Come on, Snow.

43:01.163 --> 43:05.583
Mm-hm. To Sir Te and to his House.

43:08.878 --> 43:14.468
They say a woman who can hold her wine
is a woman a man will want to hold.

43:14.551 --> 43:17.012
- Who says that?
- I do.

43:24.811 --> 43:27.063
We drink to remember,

43:27.147 --> 43:30.526
but it seems you drink to forget.

43:35.822 --> 43:37.866
How do you take the measure of a man?

43:37.949 --> 43:39.451
Which part of a man?

43:40.660 --> 43:42.329
Ma, behave.

43:42.412 --> 43:44.581
I said nothing.

43:44.664 --> 43:46.416
The wine was asking.

43:46.500 --> 43:48.377
Ask your heart.

43:49.127 --> 43:52.130
I do. My head answers.

43:52.214 --> 43:53.507
Mm!

43:53.590 --> 43:56.009
The greatest battle of them all.

43:56.092 --> 43:58.345
And you are hardly the only
who fights it here.

43:59.388 --> 44:00.638
Where is Silent Wolf?

44:00.722 --> 44:03.016
He guards with Thunder Fist.

44:04.642 --> 44:07.604
So Master Yu, what is she like?

44:10.607 --> 44:12.442
Pierce its heart.

44:12.526 --> 44:16.405
True skill is a key in the moon.

44:16.488 --> 44:19.699
Listen... with your nose.

44:21.326 --> 44:24.287
A predictable attack has a predictable...

44:28.750 --> 44:30.793
Mm.

44:46.184 --> 44:48.562
You asked to be taught.

44:48.645 --> 44:50.855
And clearly,
there is much you need to learn.

44:50.939 --> 44:52.482
How long, teacher?

45:02.576 --> 45:06.079
Until the shadow moves from here to there.

45:08.290 --> 45:09.958
Twice.

45:35.024 --> 45:36.776
You learn quickly.

45:38.153 --> 45:39.946
That's good.

45:55.712 --> 45:58.298
Snow Vase. How do you know her?

45:58.381 --> 45:59.675
I do not.

45:59.757 --> 46:01.843
Then her interest in you?

46:16.358 --> 46:19.569
Your master believes
you have interest in me. True?

46:21.738 --> 46:25.367
Talk to me. I am bored.

46:26.493 --> 46:28.495
- Lonely.
- Neither is my problem.

46:28.578 --> 46:31.289
- But what if you are their solution?
- Stop talking.

46:32.666 --> 46:35.835
A single smile and you have my word.
I will fall silent.

46:36.753 --> 46:38.796
How can you fall silent
and yet give a word?

46:38.880 --> 46:41.675
How can you hold so much wine
and not smile?

47:23.508 --> 47:27.429
This is territory
allied to the Red Desert clan.

47:27.512 --> 47:29.431
We have cut off their supply.

47:30.098 --> 47:32.058
Come the New Moon,

47:32.141 --> 47:35.645
West Lotus will own this entire territory.

47:36.605 --> 47:39.065
But this is merely Lingbao.

47:40.108 --> 47:41.735
Not Peking.

47:43.528 --> 47:46.197
Mantis will go where an army cannot.

47:47.407 --> 47:52.078
While you soldiers will gather
at the Twin Rivers and prepare for war

47:52.161 --> 47:54.914
against all rival clans
in the Martial World.

47:56.207 --> 47:58.585
I will succeed where Wei-Fang did not.

48:07.510 --> 48:09.846
What do you see now, prophet?

48:11.640 --> 48:14.142
I see nothing,

48:14.225 --> 48:16.519
but I hear word.

48:17.270 --> 48:21.274
Just as you heard word that Wei-Fang
would succeed in his raid?

48:21.357 --> 48:23.276
Give another false prophecy,

48:23.359 --> 48:26.904
you'll not only have no eyes,
you'll have no tongue.

48:26.988 --> 48:29.907
But then you wouldn't know
of the honored guest

48:29.991 --> 48:32.910
who now resides at the House of Te.

48:34.412 --> 48:38.750
One thought long dead has returned.

48:41.628 --> 48:44.380
Thunder Fist will guard the south gate.

48:44.464 --> 48:47.133
Turtle Ma,
we are vulnerable here.

50:03.960 --> 50:04.960
Guard!

51:14.322 --> 51:16.282
They've come for me.

51:16.365 --> 51:18.034
I've come for you.

51:18.743 --> 51:22.288
They leave destruction,
death in their wake.

51:22.371 --> 51:24.666
Do you still stand with them?

51:27.502 --> 51:31.380
Do you still stand with them?

51:59.492 --> 52:00.660
Look out.

52:07.750 --> 52:08.793
Where's the sword?

52:08.877 --> 52:10.545
He does not know.

52:18.970 --> 52:20.596
The sword is in the east courtyard.

52:21.138 --> 52:23.474
Once I hold the blade,
you will be the first to fall.

52:38.698 --> 52:40.783
You will not find it there,

52:40.867 --> 52:43.160
nor take it from here.

52:48.332 --> 52:49.542
Master Yu!

52:51.210 --> 52:54.213
Let him go.

53:02.304 --> 53:03.472
Release him.

53:03.556 --> 53:06.935
Give it to me now or he dies!

53:07.018 --> 53:09.311
The House of Te will fall.

53:09.395 --> 53:12.732
As will the followers of the Iron Way.

53:12.815 --> 53:13.983
Who are you?

53:15.777 --> 53:18.613
My parents were slain
by the sword you hold.

53:19.321 --> 53:23.993
On clear nights, I still hear them
calling to me from the other world.

53:25.369 --> 53:27.122
One word...

53:27.663 --> 53:29.331
vengeance.

53:49.936 --> 53:52.772
Such a pity to die for a fee.

53:58.069 --> 54:00.404
Not for gold, it's for the Iron Way.

54:05.994 --> 54:10.999
My brother died for the Iron Way.
It was worthless.

54:11.082 --> 54:13.960
You should have found yourself
a better cause,

54:14.043 --> 54:15.419
as I did.

54:17.839 --> 54:20.299
Shi! No! Get away from her!

55:11.684 --> 55:13.144
<i>Turtle Ma...</i>

55:19.150 --> 55:22.528
<i>Famed in the tavern
of the river and lakes.</i>

55:24.613 --> 55:27.533
<i>Silver Dart Shi.
Famed in Fuzhou.</i>

55:30.494 --> 55:34.290
<i>And now I mourn the death of Sir Te Zhao,</i>

55:34.373 --> 55:37.919
<i>the son of the man
who was like a father to me.</i>

55:55.436 --> 55:57.521
All this for a sword.

55:57.605 --> 56:00.482
Code, duty, honor.

56:01.317 --> 56:05.529
Excuses for bloodshed,
all of them.

56:09.242 --> 56:11.493
That is why I left it behind.

56:13.121 --> 56:15.539
I was content.

56:15.623 --> 56:17.041
Above it all.

56:18.751 --> 56:21.796
And now a kite laments its return.

56:29.887 --> 56:31.931
I will take the sword and leave.

56:34.016 --> 56:37.812
No. They watch the roads.

56:37.895 --> 56:39.188
It is safer here.

56:39.272 --> 56:41.649
But I do not feel it.

56:42.733 --> 56:45.320
Not when vengeance chokes the air.

56:58.499 --> 57:00.042
You saved my life.

57:00.126 --> 57:02.003
I spoke before I thought.

57:02.795 --> 57:04.713
Your words came from the heart.

57:27.528 --> 57:29.364
Your mother...

57:30.281 --> 57:31.991
tell me of her.

57:33.993 --> 57:36.704
- Why?
- What was she like?

57:39.165 --> 57:40.916
I have no mother.

57:42.210 --> 57:44.795
I was raised by Iron Crow of West Lotus.

57:45.921 --> 57:48.132
<i>He taught me everything I know,</i>

57:48.216 --> 57:50.301
<i>as your teacher taught you.</i>

57:56.682 --> 57:58.767
You learn fast.

57:59.601 --> 58:01.478
Knowledge is in your blood.

58:02.355 --> 58:03.647
Again.

58:04.690 --> 58:06.984
<i>He gave me a sense of purpose.</i>

58:28.630 --> 58:30.841
Your mother was a concubine.

58:31.926 --> 58:34.095
Or so you've been told.

58:36.138 --> 58:38.140
- How do you...
- I know your past.

58:39.808 --> 58:40.809
Who told you this?

58:45.856 --> 58:48.359
<i>A swordswoman of great renown.</i>

58:49.444 --> 58:51.946
<i>Your real mother was known as Han Mei.</i>

59:07.253 --> 59:11.299
<i>A woman who had felt
and brought immeasurable pain.</i>

59:12.508 --> 59:15.428
<i>In her womb, she carried you,</i>

59:15.511 --> 59:19.307
<i>the legacy from her last night
with the man she loved.</i>

59:25.438 --> 59:28.483
<i>Great is the joy of a child,</i>

59:28.565 --> 59:31.986
<i>greater still, the value of a boy.</i>

59:39.868 --> 59:41.370
<i>While she slept,</i>

59:41.454 --> 59:45.624
<i>a concubine who had given birth
to a daughter there days before...</i>

59:47.168 --> 59:50.379
<i>switched her worthless girl for you...</i>

59:53.090 --> 59:57.761
<i>hoping it would please her master
if she presented him with a son.</i>

01:00:03.309 --> 01:00:06.103
<i>When Han Mei realized
what had been done...</i>

01:00:07.355 --> 01:00:09.731
<i>she meant to abandon the girl.</i>

01:00:12.443 --> 01:00:14.695
<i>But her heart refused.</i>

01:00:33.088 --> 01:00:36.800
<i>She tried to wash from her skin
the blood she had shed.</i>

01:00:38.177 --> 01:00:42.723
<i>But your mother could not be rid
of the pain she had caused in her life.</i>

01:00:50.898 --> 01:00:53.150
<i>She raised me as her own.</i>

01:00:54.026 --> 01:00:56.653
<i>Trained me in the Iron Way.</i>

01:01:05.496 --> 01:01:08.707
The woman... My mother...

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:12.711
Did she look for me?

01:01:14.796 --> 01:01:17.592
<i>Every minute of every day
she searched.</i>

01:01:30.271 --> 01:01:34.983
<i>She learned the concubine had given you
to West Lotus to save her own life.</i>

01:01:37.612 --> 01:01:40.322
<i>She challenged Hades Dai for your freedom.</i>

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:33.917
<i>She showed me your birthmark
and said, "You must find him.</i>

01:02:34.001 --> 01:02:38.130
<i>If he is a good man,
stand beside him.</i>

01:02:39.632 --> 01:02:42.635
<i>If he has become a poison dragon...</i>

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.346
<i>kill him."</i>

01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:51.935
<i>Your mother,</i>

01:02:52.019 --> 01:02:53.688
<i>my teacher...</i>

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:58.025
<i>died trying to find you.</i>

01:03:05.157 --> 01:03:08.536
That is our story, yours and mine.

01:03:15.626 --> 01:03:16.793
Wait.

01:03:18.003 --> 01:03:19.421
Come back!

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.097
This is for Shi!

01:03:29.181 --> 01:03:30.807
And this is for Ma!

01:03:30.891 --> 01:03:32.100
Stop!

01:03:33.227 --> 01:03:35.688
- He is one of them!
- She's right!

01:03:37.398 --> 01:03:39.024
This is not our way.

01:03:49.744 --> 01:03:52.954
If you're going to fight, fight like men.

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:52.765
Enough!

01:04:57.936 --> 01:04:59.563
Someone taught you well.

01:04:59.647 --> 01:05:01.607
Not well enough.

01:05:15.746 --> 01:05:17.205
Teacher?

01:05:17.289 --> 01:05:18.332
Come in.

01:05:27.508 --> 01:05:29.009
You're leaving.

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:31.679
The sword cannot be kept here.

01:05:33.221 --> 01:05:35.223
Where are you taking it?

01:05:35.307 --> 01:05:39.269
I would not burden you with that
knowledge. Too many will hunt it.

01:05:40.187 --> 01:05:42.815
- Can I go with you?
- No.

01:05:43.482 --> 01:05:45.901
I must make this journey alone.

01:05:46.485 --> 01:05:48.320
What about Silent Wolf?

01:05:49.905 --> 01:05:50.906
Will he go?

01:05:50.989 --> 01:05:52.032
Why should he?

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:53.826
I see the way you are together.

01:05:54.827 --> 01:05:56.787
Is it that you don't trust him anymore?

01:05:59.164 --> 01:06:00.582
You speak of trust?

01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:03.669
You, whose teacher who was Han Mei.

01:06:06.505 --> 01:06:08.298
You always knew?

01:06:09.383 --> 01:06:11.844
She learned her skills at Wudang.

01:06:13.053 --> 01:06:18.308
Then chose to use them for her own gain
as an outlaw on the run.

01:06:19.643 --> 01:06:22.354
You think I wouldn't see
her shadow on your sword?

01:06:22.437 --> 01:06:25.524
I wanted to save you from her fate.

01:06:25.607 --> 01:06:28.193
You know nothing of her fate.

01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:31.947
Her life was lost to that butcher,
Hades Dai.

01:06:33.073 --> 01:06:35.992
I sought the sword and your teachings
to avenge her.

01:06:36.076 --> 01:06:38.537
Do not carry vengeance
in your heart, Snow...

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:41.248
You tell me to let go of my past.

01:06:42.791 --> 01:06:46.879
Silent Wolf waits for you
and yet you do nothing.

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:51.800
So much for your legendary courage.

01:06:51.884 --> 01:06:53.468
My path is set.

01:06:53.552 --> 01:06:55.178
You are still young.

01:06:55.262 --> 01:06:56.889
Yours is not.

01:06:58.807 --> 01:07:00.893
I know what I must do.

01:07:27.711 --> 01:07:30.213
Silver Dart Shi.

01:07:30.297 --> 01:07:32.841
She had more courage than any one of us.

01:07:39.473 --> 01:07:41.475
Turtle Ma.

01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:45.729
I never thought I'd be saying this,
but I'm going to miss him.

01:07:49.107 --> 01:07:51.026
Pour him a double.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.415
You know, at the Battle of Sichuan,

01:08:05.499 --> 01:08:08.251
I did hire out to those raiders.

01:08:08.335 --> 01:08:11.129
But only because I thought
that they were doing the right thing.

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:13.589
I know that.

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:17.928
Always did.

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:21.389
And you hired out
to that gold convoy for the same reason.

01:08:22.808 --> 01:08:24.559
The Iron Way...

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.895
some of us never stop living by it.

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:30.816
Even if it meant dying by it.

01:08:32.943 --> 01:08:36.321
I came here to pay my respects to Sir Te.

01:08:43.495 --> 01:08:45.205
And now...

01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:48.000
I mourn for his son.

01:08:50.669 --> 01:08:54.965
Tonight... I leave with the sword.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:00.345
And Silent Wolf?

01:09:02.014 --> 01:09:03.390
Will you speak with him?

01:09:07.227 --> 01:09:08.812
I'll guard the sword.

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:26.203
<i>You betrayed Hades Dai, boy.</i>

01:09:26.955 --> 01:09:29.082
Is she worth your life?

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.710
<i>And that of your teacher?</i>

01:09:32.627 --> 01:09:36.924
Bring Hades Dai the sword
or your Master, Iron Crow, dies.

01:09:38.258 --> 01:09:41.970
<i>Even now, he rides to meet you
and secure the sword.</i>

01:10:06.578 --> 01:10:07.579
Go!

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:11.294
I cannot leave without the sword.
You know this.

01:10:11.332 --> 01:10:13.794
- You will be killed if you take it.
- I will be killed if I don't.

01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:15.921
Then go!

01:10:16.004 --> 01:10:19.299
Far from here,
far from West Lotus Temple.

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:22.970
I fulfilled my promise to your mother.

01:10:23.053 --> 01:10:26.723
Now you must promise me to never return.

01:10:28.809 --> 01:10:30.560
I promise.

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:17.565
I never saw him.

01:11:20.986 --> 01:11:25.157
Felt a hand on my arm,
then I could not move.

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:27.283
- What happened?
- The sword.

01:11:27.367 --> 01:11:28.994
The boy escaped and stole it.

01:12:11.745 --> 01:12:15.832
You hold your life in your hand.
Think of that.

01:12:15.916 --> 01:12:18.793
It is not my life I hold this for.

01:15:20.808 --> 01:15:24.062
Go! Take the sword and save yourself.

01:15:26.814 --> 01:15:28.608
Protect the sword with your life!

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:39.786
Teacher!

01:15:39.869 --> 01:15:40.870
Go!

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:35.049
- Be still.
- I am all right.

01:16:35.133 --> 01:16:37.344
Let me stop the bleeding.

01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:43.933
Shu Lien...

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.645
I have failed you again.

01:16:52.608 --> 01:16:57.613
You made your choice all those years ago.
Now I will make my choice.

01:17:03.786 --> 01:17:07.832
To live the Iron Way,
may be to die for it.

01:17:10.293 --> 01:17:13.171
I would rather
face an army by your side...

01:17:14.881 --> 01:17:17.258
than to live another day without you.

01:18:46.973 --> 01:18:49.434
Your prophecy is proven.

01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:54.730
Your teacher would be proud.

01:18:59.277 --> 01:19:01.488
And my mother as well.

01:20:37.667 --> 01:20:42.088
How does a man I once killed
return to challenge me?

01:20:56.269 --> 01:20:57.269
Yah!

01:22:19.602 --> 01:22:22.730
Come with me into the dark,
Shu Lien.

01:23:02.729 --> 01:23:05.773
We will have our vengeance on you.

01:23:05.857 --> 01:23:11.487
Now you will join your beloved, Li Mu Bai.

01:25:28.207 --> 01:25:30.250
No... no.

01:25:52.523 --> 01:25:53.941
Ha!

01:26:49.622 --> 01:26:51.999
We don't hold this sword.

01:26:52.959 --> 01:26:56.087
This sword holds us.

01:27:26.325 --> 01:27:28.869
No. I can't lose you.

01:27:28.953 --> 01:27:29.996
No.

01:27:32.165 --> 01:27:33.749
You must fight.

01:27:37.878 --> 01:27:39.505
Stay with us.

01:27:47.972 --> 01:27:50.599
<i>It is said
that a swordsman's name</i>

01:27:50.683 --> 01:27:54.353
<i>will last for twenty years
beyond his passing.</i>

01:27:54.436 --> 01:27:58.024
<i>But I believe that some names
will live forever.</i>

01:27:59.108 --> 01:28:01.110
Flying Blade of Shantung.

01:28:01.194 --> 01:28:02.611
At your service.

01:28:03.445 --> 01:28:05.906
Thunder Fist Chan, famed in Zhejiang.

01:28:06.615 --> 01:28:09.827
Silver Dart Shi. Famed in Fuzhou.

01:28:10.494 --> 01:28:15.290
Turtle Ma. Famed in... this tavern.

01:28:16.834 --> 01:28:20.337
<i>I am Yu Shu Lien,
famed in Peking.</i>

01:28:21.547 --> 01:28:24.008
<i>He is Meng Si Zhao.</i>

01:28:24.091 --> 01:28:26.552
<i>Known as Silent Wolf in the west.</i>

01:28:31.849 --> 01:28:33.267
<i>He is Wei-Fang,</i>

01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:35.811
<i>who found his way back through the dark.</i>

01:28:42.068 --> 01:28:44.361
<i>She is Snow Vase,</i>

01:28:44.444 --> 01:28:47.031
<i>the warrior who fulfilled her vow...</i>

01:28:48.574 --> 01:28:53.120
<i>and brought redemption to the woman
who raised her in the Iron Way.</i>

01:29:00.836 --> 01:29:05.340
<i>We take the sword to Wudang Mountain
where it will be safe.</i>

01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:13.182
<i>Code, duty, honor,</i>

01:29:13.266 --> 01:29:16.810
<i>I believe there are things
worth fighting for.</i>
