Previously on Fire Country...
I got my dad a credit card

00:09.377 --> 00:11.645
a while back. Now there's a huge
unpaid balance on that card.

00:11.745 --> 00:14.548
We'll need
the first payment today.

00:14.648 --> 00:17.451
Sitting on a transplant list
could take up to ten years...

00:17.551 --> 00:18.886
I'll talk to your specialist,

00:18.986 --> 00:20.488
and if she says
to come down for treatments,

00:20.588 --> 00:22.123
I'll fly down and do them.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.991
Vince is out today.
Yeah, I'm stepping up
on his behalf,

00:24.092 --> 00:26.026
so it's me that you'll be
coordinating with.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.162
Tell him, tell Vince
what you did to make the board

00:28.262 --> 00:30.064
put me on a leave of absence.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.565
"Pride comes before the fall."

00:31.665 --> 00:33.801
Feel like I've been falling
for a long time.

00:33.901 --> 00:36.804
* Happy birthday, dear Riley *

00:36.904 --> 00:38.572
(both shouting)

00:38.672 --> 00:40.974
VINCE: There you go.
That's good. Good job, Bode.

00:41.075 --> 00:43.277
First Saw.
It's a big deal.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.579
Thanks, Dad.

00:54.222 --> 00:57.125
Yes, that's it, baby.

00:57.225 --> 00:58.359
Give me an ace.

00:58.459 --> 01:01.662

Hit me.

01:06.467 --> 01:07.668
Come on, man.

01:07.768 --> 01:09.370
You're gonna take
the dealer's bust card--

01:09.470 --> 01:11.205
I'm taking
a calculated risk, homie.

01:11.305 --> 01:13.707
Stay out of it.

01:13.807 --> 01:14.675
Hit me.

have been hers.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.226
That was
my rent money, man.

01:32.326 --> 01:34.695
That's not my problem.
Yeah, I'm gonna
make it your problem.

01:34.795 --> 01:36.364
No fighting or you're
both out of here.

01:36.464 --> 01:37.465
Sit down.
Hey!

01:37.565 --> 01:39.233
MAN:

It's 4:30 in
the morning, man.

01:57.685 --> 02:01.455
Yeah, uh, I'm just gonna hit
the ATM... real quick.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.123
I'll be right back.

Come here.

02:22.443 --> 02:25.045
I missed you.
Oh, me too.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.548
(groans softly)

02:28.416 --> 02:30.150
And Edgewater.

02:30.251 --> 02:33.086
You know that everyone in L.A.
is an "influencer"?
(chuckles)

02:33.187 --> 02:35.456
Like, literally everyone.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.358
And I don't know what
Lilly pumped me up with,

02:37.458 --> 02:38.992
but I feel so good.

02:39.092 --> 02:40.961
And she sends her love.
(sighs)

02:41.061 --> 02:43.731
Now you're gonna tell me
how much you missed me.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.667
Desperately,
you know that.
Mm.

02:46.767 --> 02:50.971
I did resort to hanging out
with Father Pascal.

02:52.139 --> 02:54.342
I'm gone two days,
and now you're a convert?

02:54.442 --> 02:57.010
(chuckles)
Um, yeah. No.

02:57.110 --> 03:00.614
But... you know,
we just got to talking

03:00.714 --> 03:02.115
and he made me realize that...

03:02.216 --> 03:04.452
(exhales softly)

03:04.552 --> 03:07.120
There's something
I need to tell you.

03:08.622 --> 03:12.125
Something I did
to protect you, okay?

03:12.226 --> 03:14.528
Mm...

03:14.628 --> 03:16.797
Okay, you lit a candle
in his church

03:16.897 --> 03:20.000
or you said three rosaries
or an Our Father?

03:21.402 --> 03:24.171
Oh, you're making
me nervous.

03:24.272 --> 03:28.175
It was me who got you put
on medical leave, not Luke.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.678
No, no!

03:30.778 --> 03:33.547
Why? Why would you
do that?!

03:33.647 --> 03:35.483
Shar, I was scared, okay?

03:35.583 --> 03:38.151
Doctor said slow down,
y-you speed up.

03:38.252 --> 03:39.520
You're unstoppable, so I...

03:39.620 --> 03:41.689
(groans) You went
over my head to the board?

03:41.789 --> 03:43.624
I stopped you.
(sighs)

03:43.724 --> 03:46.159
No! That's not the way
we do things.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.828
No, and you let your brother

03:47.928 --> 03:49.830
take the blame for you?

03:49.930 --> 03:52.065
Actually,
he covered for me.

03:52.165 --> 03:54.902
(stammers)

03:55.002 --> 03:57.338
I thanked him.

03:57.438 --> 03:58.872
So, you two handled me?

03:58.972 --> 04:01.542
No. This is not--
Don't blame Luke.

04:01.642 --> 04:04.445
It's not his fault.
For once.

04:04.545 --> 04:06.847
He rolled with my choices.

04:06.947 --> 04:10.951
You are always telling me
how you can't bear to lose Bode,

04:11.051 --> 04:13.053
you can't bear to lose
another member of this family.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.455
And neither can I!

04:14.555 --> 04:17.291
So I...

04:20.260 --> 04:22.296
* *

04:31.339 --> 04:33.541
I'm not going anywhere.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.212
I hate the way you did this.

04:39.313 --> 04:41.214
I know, I know.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.617
I do, too.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.319
I'm sorry.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.773
You enjoy watching
my back the whole time?

05:05.873 --> 05:07.307
Better view
than your front.
Ha ha!

05:07.408 --> 05:08.509
Come on, guys.

05:08.609 --> 05:09.777
Let's get some water
here, okay?

05:09.877 --> 05:11.779
Take a break for a minute.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.614
Then we'll hike
back down to camp.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.716
FREDDY:
Oh.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.251
I'd love to bring
Cookie here.

05:18.352 --> 05:19.487
No!

05:19.587 --> 05:21.789
We should have
our wedding here.

05:21.889 --> 05:23.156
You're getting married?

05:23.256 --> 05:25.393
Rebecca, from
the women's camp?

05:25.493 --> 05:27.828
She knows about more
than plea deals.

05:27.928 --> 05:32.666
She says if we get hitched,
we get conjugal visits.

05:32.766 --> 05:35.969
Next time Cookie comes,
I'm proposing.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.372
That sounds nice, Freddy.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.541
A weekend alone with my girl.

05:40.641 --> 05:41.875
Mm!

05:43.343 --> 05:44.945
I can't wait to meet her.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.481
Speaking of Rebecca,

05:47.581 --> 05:51.552
I clocked you "seeking counsel"
with her again last night.

05:51.652 --> 05:52.853
Mm?

05:52.953 --> 05:54.054
All right, guys.
Let's go.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.556
We're heading back to camp.
Come on.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.391
(laughs)

05:57.491 --> 05:59.092
Let's go.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.629
(laughter, indistinct chatter)

06:02.530 --> 06:04.798

06:09.302 --> 06:11.104
Mmm!
Mm-hmm.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.973
Good, right?

06:13.073 --> 06:15.108
Act like I don't thrown
down in the kitchen.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.944
You could have that
every day.

06:17.044 --> 06:20.113
I'm talking breakfast,
lunch, dinner.
Mm-hmm.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.383
It sounds delicious
on many levels.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.553
Wait, wait,
so, so...

06:25.653 --> 06:27.655
so is that a yes
to moving in?

06:28.622 --> 06:30.323
I'm still thinking about it.

06:30.424 --> 06:32.693
It's a big decision.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.895
Jake, couples
move in too fast

06:34.995 --> 06:37.898
and then it just
ruins everything.
Hey, hey, Gabs.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.934
Moving in is not gonna
ruin anything.

06:41.034 --> 06:44.171
I'm sure enough
for the both of us.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.140
Please, just say yes.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.711
I'm just still worried
about my dad.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.481
He was out all night again.

06:53.581 --> 06:56.149
Well, you know...

06:56.249 --> 06:59.219
Maybe the man is enjoying
his personal life.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.889
Privately.
Mm.

07:01.989 --> 07:07.160
I wish that were it, but...
I don't know.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.898
The-the late hours,
the lack of transparency...

07:10.998 --> 07:15.903
Ooh, is that Jake's famous
breakfast burritos?

07:16.003 --> 07:18.305
Okay.
(laughing)

07:18.405 --> 07:22.576
Yeah, it is...
It is a "welcome back" feast.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.311
Mm-hmm.
Appreciate you, baby.

07:24.411 --> 07:28.482
And I bet Aydan's TLC
helped you heal a lot faster.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.484
Nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.452
Nope Aydan?
What happened?

07:32.553 --> 07:34.888
Well, you know, we had
a couple of really hot weeks.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.524
Know what I'm saying,

07:36.624 --> 07:38.191
know what I'm saying,
know what I'm saying?
(laughs)

07:38.291 --> 07:40.494
(laughing)
Okay, okay.
But then, what?

07:40.594 --> 07:43.531
But, uh, you know, she's still
mourning her marriage

07:43.631 --> 07:45.933
which...
you know, I get it.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.135
GABRIELA:
Mm-hmm.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.438
You see?

07:51.539 --> 07:55.075
Moving too fast
can screw things up.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.747
Did I miss something?

08:01.248 --> 08:03.050
(buzzing)

08:03.150 --> 08:05.118
MANNY:
All right, gentlemen, remember.

08:05.218 --> 08:08.989
This part of Edgewater
is a hotbed for brushfires.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.258
So be thorough, please.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.926
(buzzing stops)

08:15.729 --> 08:18.165
FREDDY:
Is this your sister's?

08:18.265 --> 08:21.535
No, but could be
somebody's sister.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.238
These memorials
are morbid to me.

08:25.338 --> 08:29.109
Why would you want to
remember where somebody died?

08:29.209 --> 08:32.680
Well, if you ask my dad,
it's a matter of respect,

08:32.780 --> 08:35.716
honoring the person.
And to you?

08:36.717 --> 08:39.687
I'm just trying to look
forward, like you, you know?

08:39.787 --> 08:40.854
Past the accident,
past Riley.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.455

Slow down!

08:47.661 --> 08:49.630
FREDDY:
Whoa, too fast.

08:49.730 --> 08:52.499

Let's go!

08:55.969 --> 08:57.838
MAN:
Get up there!

08:57.938 --> 09:00.340
Freddy, assess that flipped car!

09:00.440 --> 09:02.576

Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:02.676 --> 09:03.844
BODE:
Hey, hey, stop!

09:03.944 --> 09:05.913
Stop! You're gonna
hurt yourself worse.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.615
Stop! We got you.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.382
MANNY:
A damn hit-and-run.

09:09.482 --> 09:10.884
Should we follow her?
No, do a 360

09:10.984 --> 09:11.685
and make sure
no one is in that car.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.553
Bode, you and me.

09:14.121 --> 09:17.758
Hello.
Hey, can you hear me?

09:17.858 --> 09:19.292
My name is Manny.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.730
I'm... I'm Yara.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.765
What-- what happened?

09:24.865 --> 09:26.900
(grunts)

09:27.000 --> 09:28.268
Some idiot hit your car.

09:28.368 --> 09:31.104
But we're gonna
help you, okay?

09:33.206 --> 09:34.374
Sam.

09:37.277 --> 09:40.981
Sam, wake up.
Sam, wake up.

09:41.749 --> 09:45.018
Sam... Sam, wake up.

09:47.755 --> 09:49.356
Hey, Cap?

09:49.456 --> 09:51.458
(water rushing)

09:51.558 --> 09:53.026
* *

10:00.901 --> 10:03.136
* *

10:14.982 --> 10:16.483
So, you and Gabriela
aren't moving in together?

10:16.583 --> 10:18.185
Because I could use
a roommate,

10:18.285 --> 10:20.220
if she needs a place
to stay 'cause of rent.
No, stop, stop.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.889
Because we are.

10:21.989 --> 10:26.093
It's just that Gabs, she...
she wants to be sure.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.628
And I can respect that.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.898
You seem a little bummed.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.866
I mean,
I'm sure about us, right?

10:32.966 --> 10:34.401
Mm.

10:34.501 --> 10:37.504
And do-do I wish she was too?
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.206
But...

10:39.973 --> 10:44.812
I mean, it's Gabs.
So I-I-I can be patient.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.513
Can you?

10:46.613 --> 10:49.016
(laughing)
He just...

10:49.116 --> 10:52.953
You're funny.
You're funny.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.555
Feels good to be back with
y'all, you know what I'm saying?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.490
You know what? It's good
to have you back, too.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.793
Oh, I was talking to
the burritos, but...

10:59.893 --> 11:02.095
Appreciate you.
Wow.
(chuckles)

11:02.195 --> 11:03.663
(alarm ringing)
Oh!

11:03.764 --> 11:06.934
Let's go, baby.
Missed this. Whoo!

11:07.034 --> 11:08.468
* *

11:11.772 --> 11:14.407
This webbing's got to keep
this entire car from falling?

11:14.507 --> 11:15.743
Just till the engine
gets here.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.811
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're pulling too hard.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.279
That's as far
as we can take it.

11:19.379 --> 11:20.981
Tie it off.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.183
Hey, Cap, these kids
need out of this car.
I know that, Bode.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.018
But we're under-equipped for
an extrication like this.

11:25.118 --> 11:26.820
All right? Now we got
backup coming.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.255
So just go grab some cones,
and keep the traffic back.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.556
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:29.656 --> 11:32.692
Something's leaking.
Is that fuel?

11:32.793 --> 11:36.263
All right, guys, listen up.
Listen up. Come here.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.331
We do not want to add fire
to this mangled nightmare

11:38.431 --> 11:40.000
so grab your shovels,
grab some of that dirt,

11:40.100 --> 11:42.335
throw it on this fuel
and get it into buckets

11:42.435 --> 11:44.704
before the engine arrives
to pull this thing off the edge.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.074
Let's go, let's go.
Move, move, move.
Sir.

11:47.174 --> 11:50.643
Yo, does Cap seem a little
on edge today?
A little?

11:52.846 --> 11:54.281
(knock at door)

11:55.648 --> 11:57.818
Thank you
for coming, Luke.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.989
What's this?
It's a puzzle to keep
your nerd brain

12:02.089 --> 12:04.091
off of dialysis
while you heal.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.559
Even after I...

12:06.659 --> 12:09.562
Dressed me down for
something I didn't do?

12:09.662 --> 12:11.164
Yup. Aw, the memories.

12:11.264 --> 12:15.402
Oh... I'm so sorry
for even thinking...
Oh, yeah, yeah.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.004
...that you would
snake my job.

12:17.104 --> 12:20.007
Mm-hmm.
I will never be able to
apologize enough.

12:20.107 --> 12:23.010
I should be the one
bringing you a gift.
Yeah, you should.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.712
But your presence
is my present.

12:25.813 --> 12:27.747
Oh, yeah.
I know.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.349
This is a lot.
(laughs)

12:29.449 --> 12:33.620
But seriously, you have taken
hits for this family before.

12:33.720 --> 12:37.457
It's-it's not fair.
Well... (exhales)
We're family, Shar.

12:37.557 --> 12:40.327
You can't shake me,
try as Vince might.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.096
I'm so glad you didn't
try and snake my job.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.331
Or rat me out.

12:44.431 --> 12:47.801
Listen, while
I have you here...

12:47.901 --> 12:51.271
there is some more business
that we need to discuss.

12:51.371 --> 12:52.472
And is not pleasant.

12:52.572 --> 12:54.007
Okay.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.244
Sharon, I know.

12:58.511 --> 12:59.646
You know what?

12:59.746 --> 13:01.048
That you pulled
strings with Manny

13:01.148 --> 13:03.083
to get Bode to stay
at Three Rock.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.085
* *

13:05.185 --> 13:07.120
What's that all about?

13:07.220 --> 13:09.556
(horns honking)

13:10.523 --> 13:12.759
MANNY: Hey, Chief,
what's the ETA on that engine?

13:12.860 --> 13:14.862
We are in some hell of
gridlock, but we're doing

13:14.962 --> 13:17.797
the best we can.
That's not gonna cut it.

13:17.898 --> 13:21.134
Heard you the first time.
We'll find a way.
Copy.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.736
(honks horn)
EVE:
That's all you've got, Jake?

13:23.837 --> 13:27.140
I can't just plow
through traffic, Eve.

13:27.908 --> 13:29.977
Hey, did my dad sound
stressed to you?

13:30.077 --> 13:31.244
I'm stressed.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.213
What--
What if we...?

13:33.313 --> 13:36.183
Ju--
You got an idea?

13:36.283 --> 13:38.785
Well, just because the engine's
stopped doesn't mean we are.

13:38.886 --> 13:40.053
So we...
Yeah. No, no, no.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.721
Olson can take over driving

13:41.821 --> 13:43.223
and get the engine up there
as fast as he can.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.592
Meanwhile, we can run up there
with the combi tool,

13:45.692 --> 13:47.694
the ram, the chain,
and the med bag.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.096
It's not everything,

13:49.196 --> 13:51.564
but it gives us a chance
to size up the scene.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.867
I like it.
Yeah.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.869
Well, I know how to
move on a good idea.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.670
VINCE:
Manny, we're gonna
make our way up to you

13:57.770 --> 13:58.972
on foot with the tools.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.174
Engine will be behind
when it can.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.910
MANNY:
Copy.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.445
You're always
teaching us probies

14:05.545 --> 14:07.180
to get the courage
to speak up.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.951
That's right. And?

14:11.952 --> 14:13.020
GABRIELA:
You just let him

14:13.120 --> 14:14.787
pitch your whole idea
to Chief?

14:14.888 --> 14:16.890
It's teamwork.

14:21.561 --> 14:24.297
* *

14:24.397 --> 14:26.599
YARA:
Hey, Manny?

14:26.699 --> 14:28.735
Yeah?
(phone ringing)

14:30.237 --> 14:32.605
(grunts) My legs feel like
they're being ripped off,

14:32.705 --> 14:35.142
and my brother Sam
is not waking up.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.111
That's probably
for the best, Yara.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.313
If your brother wakes up
and he gets scared,

14:40.413 --> 14:41.448
he could rock this car.

14:41.548 --> 14:42.882
And we don't want that
to happen.

14:42.983 --> 14:46.819
Be-Because that would send us
over the edge?

14:47.988 --> 14:50.357
(sobbing):
We're really high up!

14:50.457 --> 14:52.359
Please.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.694
Get us out of here.

14:54.794 --> 14:57.164
We're just waiting for the right
equipment to show up, Yara.

14:57.264 --> 14:59.032
But for now I need you
to be very, very still.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.700
Can you do that for me?

15:01.534 --> 15:03.636
(exhales)
Yeah.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.605
Good.

15:05.705 --> 15:08.175
Please, please hurry.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.477
(horns honking)
(indistinct radio chatter)

15:11.411 --> 15:13.846
Come on, where the hell
are you guys?

15:13.947 --> 15:16.116
* *

15:20.287 --> 15:23.856
What's going on up there?
Car wreck.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.725
They don't have time
to stop and chat, hon.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.660
Let them work.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.696
Who're you calling?
The kids.

15:29.796 --> 15:31.731
(line ringing)
Again?

15:32.865 --> 15:35.135
(phone ringing)

15:35.235 --> 15:37.137
(crying)

15:38.405 --> 15:41.741
Finally. Hey, Chief,
we have two patients.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.510
One conscious
with a pelvic injury,

15:43.610 --> 15:45.512
the other one unconscious,
but he's breathing.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.580
Let's get 'em out of there.
It's not that simple, Chief.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.249
Car's teetering
over the edge.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.918
We so much as tap it in the
wrong direction, it goes over,

15:52.019 --> 15:53.320
it takes both
those kids with it.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.055
How many wrecks have
to happen on these roads

15:55.155 --> 15:57.857
before they make 'em safer?

15:57.957 --> 15:59.559
(indistinct radio chatter)

16:00.360 --> 16:02.195
This is the craziest car wreck
I've ever seen.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.198
It's not the craziest one
I've seen, sadly.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.733
I'm sorry. I-I...

16:06.833 --> 16:08.568
I shouldn't...
No, it's fine.
It's fine. Seriously.

16:08.668 --> 16:09.969
With a crash this serious,

16:10.070 --> 16:11.471
I just want to make sure
my dad's up for it.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.373
Does he seem off
to you, too?

16:13.473 --> 16:15.442
Yeah, he's been tired
and stressed.

16:15.542 --> 16:16.976
Yeah, he's preoccupied,
with a short fuse.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.978
Something's up with him.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.980
Whatever it is,
I have his back.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.250
We all do.
Don't worry, all right?
Thank you.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.452
Listen, Chief,
once we start this extrication,

16:25.552 --> 16:27.054
we're gonna disrupt
the balance of the car

16:27.154 --> 16:28.688
and risk sending it
over the edge.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.323
So we need to work
incredibly fast, Chief.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.592
And if we can pull at least one
of those siblings out in time

16:32.692 --> 16:34.127
before it goes over,
it's a huge win.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.828
Did you say "siblings"?

16:35.928 --> 16:37.830
That's right--
brother and sister.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.732
The girl, Yara--
she's in the passenger seat.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.534
She's easier to access.
I say we go for it.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.003
We do a peel-and-peek,
and we tent the back window.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.373
No, Manny, that's...
That's gonna add pressure. Okay?

16:46.473 --> 16:48.041
I don't want to risk sending
her brother over the edge.

16:48.141 --> 16:50.310
Chief, the way I see it,
we got one bird in hand

16:50.410 --> 16:51.511
and two in the bush.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.047
Well, let's hope
I see it differently.

16:54.147 --> 16:57.150
HARRIET: Please! Oh, no!
No, please. Oh, my God!

16:57.250 --> 16:59.886
Tell me that's not our car!

16:59.986 --> 17:01.821
I need backup!

17:01.921 --> 17:03.390
Those kids' parents are here?
JAKE:
Hey, hey, guys. Guys, please.

17:03.490 --> 17:04.891
Please. Sir, please, ma'am.
(screaming)

17:04.991 --> 17:06.459
Ma'am, I need you guys
to calm down.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.761
No. I need you guys to please...
(indistinct shouting)

17:08.861 --> 17:10.763
Mom! Dad!

17:10.863 --> 17:11.898
(screaming)

17:11.998 --> 17:13.333
Your kids need us
right now.

17:13.433 --> 17:14.967
Guys, ma'am, ma'am.

17:15.068 --> 17:16.469
Please, calm down.
MANNY:
Listen to me. Listen to me.

17:16.569 --> 17:19.139
You can't touch the car,
or your kids. I'm sorry.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.873
Manny, I got it.
Manny, I got it.
Get out of my way.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.942
(Harriett's sobbing echoing)

17:24.611 --> 17:27.147
Chief. Chief.
Riley!

17:27.247 --> 17:29.782
Riley! Out of my way, Luke.
Chief, hey, no. Vince, no!

17:29.882 --> 17:32.919
Stop! Stop! Vince! Vince, no!
Riley!

17:33.019 --> 17:35.188
Listen to me.
There's nothing you can do.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.390
There's nothing
you can do. She's gone.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.625
No.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.059
Riley's gone.

17:40.160 --> 17:44.331
No! No! No.
I'm sorry.

17:47.467 --> 17:48.901
I'm sorry.

17:50.603 --> 17:53.273
(sobbing):
No! Oh, God.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.077
VINCE: Oh!
BODE: I'm sorry.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.946
I'm sorry, Dad.

18:00.046 --> 18:03.383
(echoing):
Dad? Dad.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.784
Dad.

18:04.884 --> 18:06.286
You good?

18:06.386 --> 18:08.355
(indistinct radio chatter)

18:08.455 --> 18:10.990
Don't ever ask me that at work.

18:12.225 --> 18:15.528
Manny, your plan's
not good enough.

18:15.628 --> 18:16.996
What do you mean,
it's not good enough, Chief?

18:17.096 --> 18:18.131
It's the only way to guarantee

18:18.231 --> 18:19.366
that we actually
save a life today.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.100
We crack the car open,
we pluck Yara out.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.469
She could be standing here

18:22.569 --> 18:24.204
hugging her parents
in half an hour.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.572
Then what? They're all standing

18:25.672 --> 18:28.375
at her brother's funeral
next week? No.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.310
We are gonna continue
to secure the car

18:30.410 --> 18:32.078
till it's stable enough
to extricate them both.

18:32.179 --> 18:33.380
What? Without an engine
to secure to?

18:33.480 --> 18:35.114
Anything, anything
goes sideways,

18:35.215 --> 18:36.716
those parents lose both
their kids on this bridge.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.117
I'm not gonna let that happen.
It's not entirely in your con...

18:38.218 --> 18:40.453
That's an order, Manny!

18:55.502 --> 18:57.404
VINCE:
All right, listen up.

18:57.504 --> 18:58.805
Still don't
have the engine here,

18:58.905 --> 19:00.407
so take the chains,
anchor the car

19:00.507 --> 19:02.409
to that guardrail post
right there.

19:02.509 --> 19:04.644
Copy.
Yeah, Chief seems amped.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.913
Cap seems pissed.
(groans): Yeah.

19:07.013 --> 19:09.682
And I'm staying out of it,
following orders.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.984
I suggest you do
the same thing.

19:12.084 --> 19:13.420
VINCE:
Hey.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.688
We all know this car
could go at any time, okay?

19:15.788 --> 19:17.724
So speed is our friend.
You hear me?
Yes, Chief.

19:17.824 --> 19:22.195
Chief, Chief, if anything
goes wrong here...

19:22.295 --> 19:25.465
Yeah, I know. Car goes over,
they die. Got it, Manny.

19:25.565 --> 19:28.100
MANNY:
Will you please just
reconsider my approach?

19:28.201 --> 19:30.303
Sam is trapped, all right?
Accessing him is a nightmare.

19:30.403 --> 19:33.206
Yara's extrication--
it's a sure thing, all right?

19:33.306 --> 19:35.208
It's obvious.
It's right there in front of us.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.809
Going after both of them
instead of just Yara--

19:36.909 --> 19:38.211
it's too risky for her.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.846
We do that
without fully securing the car,

19:39.946 --> 19:41.414
the boy's as good as dead.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.715
We've got to wait
for the engine.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.317
You know that.

19:45.151 --> 19:49.121
Now, your crew can either help
or get out of the way.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.327
Hey, Yara.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.162
I'm Vince.

19:56.263 --> 19:58.064
Are you the one to finally
get us out of here?

19:58.164 --> 19:59.532
I'm the one.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.001
But, uh, we need to make sure
your car is nice and secure

20:02.101 --> 20:04.371
before we go tearing
into it, okay?

20:04.471 --> 20:06.038
O-Okay. (cries)

20:06.138 --> 20:09.509
Listen, if your brother wakes up
while you're still in there,

20:09.609 --> 20:12.345
I need you to keep him calm
and still for me.

20:12.445 --> 20:13.646
Can you do that?

20:13.746 --> 20:16.383
I don't know.
I don't know, Vince.

20:16.483 --> 20:18.050
I don't feel very calm.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.353
But you can be.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.522
I know you can.

20:22.622 --> 20:25.292
Deep breaths.
(sighs)

20:25.392 --> 20:28.295
We're gonna get through this--
you, me and Sam.

20:28.395 --> 20:31.364
(panting)
Okay.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.165
Good.
Yeah.

20:33.266 --> 20:37.103
I-I heard my parents,
but I don't see them.

20:37.203 --> 20:38.705
Were they hit, too?

20:38.805 --> 20:41.908
No, not a scratch on 'em.

20:42.008 --> 20:46.112
That's good. That's good. Okay.

20:46.212 --> 20:48.014
Can I talk to them?

20:48.114 --> 20:51.117
(crying): In-in case
this doesn't work out.

20:51.217 --> 20:52.785
Yara,

20:52.885 --> 20:56.489
I don't want to brag,
but I'm kind of awesome at this.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.124
Is-is that a "no"?

20:59.125 --> 21:01.528
No, it's a "yes."

21:02.329 --> 21:05.398
But you got to promise me
that you are gonna stay calm...

21:05.498 --> 21:07.300
Calm and still.
Yeah.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.668
I promise.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.703
There you go.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.672
I'll be right back.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.641
SAMUEL SR.:
We want to see

21:14.741 --> 21:15.942
our children right now.
I'm sorry, sir,

21:16.042 --> 21:18.044
but I can't let you
go over there.

21:18.144 --> 21:19.812
That car's teetering
on the edge.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.514
If you were to touch it,
or if Yara were

21:21.614 --> 21:24.116
to move a little bit
too much, it...

21:24.917 --> 21:26.486
Look,
the situation's precarious,

21:26.586 --> 21:28.421
and I'm only telling you this
because if I were in your shoes,

21:28.521 --> 21:29.789
I'd want to know the truth.

21:29.889 --> 21:33.426
Mom, Dad,
I'm Chief Leone.

21:33.526 --> 21:34.961
How are they?

21:35.061 --> 21:37.664
I'm going to let you
see for yourself

21:37.764 --> 21:39.632
in-in a minute.
HARRIET:
Oh.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.534
Thank God. Thank you.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.035
Chief, are you sure that's wise?

21:43.135 --> 21:45.572
Little warning about
what you're gonna see.

21:45.672 --> 21:48.174
Sam's unconscious.
(Harriet gasps)

21:48.274 --> 21:50.843
Yara's awake.

21:50.943 --> 21:53.045
She needs her parents.

21:54.514 --> 21:55.548
So...

21:55.648 --> 21:57.049
if there's anything

21:57.149 --> 21:59.852
you want to say
to her, or-or Sam,

21:59.952 --> 22:02.755
now'd be a good time.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.227
Come on.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.968
(sighs)
GABRIELA:
Dad?

22:16.803 --> 22:18.871
What's up?

22:18.971 --> 22:20.873
Are you up for the rest
of today's work?

22:20.973 --> 22:23.009
I mean, you're tired,
you've been out all night.

22:23.109 --> 22:25.111
What? Do I have a curfew?

22:25.211 --> 22:28.214
Dad, you're dodging
my questions.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.684
I ran into some money issues.

22:31.784 --> 22:33.085
And I-I told you
that I'd pay you back

22:33.185 --> 22:35.688
for all the money that
you've sunk into diving.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.957
I lost the house, mija.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.765
Did you get lost
on your way to the bathroom

22:45.865 --> 22:47.967
in your own house,
or you just don't want

22:48.067 --> 22:49.736
to tell me
what went down with Manny?

22:49.836 --> 22:51.904
My son's at Three Rock. So what?

22:52.004 --> 22:54.173
Well, you got to admit,
it's a bit of a coincidence.

22:54.273 --> 22:57.710
There aren't that many
fire camps in California.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.045
No, I meant it's a coincidence

22:59.145 --> 23:00.647
that he's at any
fire camp at all

23:00.747 --> 23:02.715
after he punched Jake.

23:04.784 --> 23:06.886
People talk, Sharon.

23:06.986 --> 23:10.957
The C.O. let it slip the first
time I went to go see Bode.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.926
And Manny is not the kind of guy
that's gonna take that risk,

23:14.026 --> 23:16.262
unless you pressured him.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.366
I made a request.

23:20.467 --> 23:22.469
I didn't go looking
for this information, Sharon.

23:22.569 --> 23:25.972
I-I just found it, and I wasn't
sure what to do with it.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.307
Nothing. You do nothing.
I know.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.209
Of course, but, you know,

23:30.309 --> 23:32.411
with me raising money
for Red River,

23:32.512 --> 23:34.313
the board's gonna want
to check out Three Rock,

23:34.413 --> 23:36.315
and if they start
looking into this...

23:36.415 --> 23:38.350
I just don't think they care
about a random inmate

23:38.451 --> 23:40.820
with a different last name
than me.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.523
Sacramento has bigger issues
to worry about.

23:43.623 --> 23:46.425
Okay. I hope you're right.

23:46.526 --> 23:49.962
But I figured this thing out
pretty easily.

23:50.062 --> 23:52.364
Now, I'm not trying
to alarm you.

23:52.465 --> 23:54.233
I just want us
to be prepared in case

23:54.333 --> 23:56.168
someone who's not in your corner
starts asking questions.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.004
That's all.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.406
Okay. Thanks.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.943
Hey, any word
on the hit-and-run driver?

24:04.043 --> 24:06.513
No, not yet. She won't
get far on foot, though.

24:06.613 --> 24:11.518
Hey, I'm relieved Chief
overruled my dad's plan.

24:11.618 --> 24:14.253
I just don't trust
his judgment right now.

24:14.353 --> 24:18.591
Yeah, well, I'm not sure that
I trust my dad's plan, either.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.827
What do you mean?

24:22.995 --> 24:25.765
My-my sister died
on a road just like this.

24:25.865 --> 24:28.267
And he almost went up in flames
with her when he saw it.

24:28.367 --> 24:30.269
You know, I-I've worked
really hard

24:30.369 --> 24:32.138
to separate Riley
from the people that we help,

24:32.238 --> 24:36.442
but... I'm not sure that
he's where I'm at on this one.

24:36.543 --> 24:39.078
Maybe you should talk to him.

24:39.178 --> 24:42.014
Yeah, I tried. (laughs)

24:42.114 --> 24:45.084
He and I are like
oil and water.

24:45.852 --> 24:48.154
He likes you, though,
I can tell.

24:49.255 --> 24:52.258
I'll keep an eye out.

24:52.358 --> 24:54.360
This car came out
of nowhere and hit us.

24:54.460 --> 24:57.697
They were speeding
s-so fast, Dad.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.699
And then...

24:59.799 --> 25:00.933
they ran away.

25:01.033 --> 25:03.502
They're cowards,
and we'll find 'em.

25:05.404 --> 25:07.139
I'm so scared, Mom.
No, no.

25:07.239 --> 25:09.408
No, no. Shh.
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

25:09.508 --> 25:13.312
Um, I don't think
I tell you enough how much

25:13.412 --> 25:15.615
I love you.
Yeah, you do.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.516
How proud I am of you

25:17.617 --> 25:19.351
and Sammy.

25:19.451 --> 25:21.654
I'm so sorry
we never got you that dog.

25:21.754 --> 25:25.424
Oh.
Then you had that pet rat.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.525
(Yara laughs)

25:26.626 --> 25:28.327
Remember?

25:28.427 --> 25:29.762
(laughing):
Cinderella.

25:29.862 --> 25:30.930
HARRIET:
That's right.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.899
Oh, Mama.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.200
You both took

25:34.300 --> 25:36.002
such good care of her.

25:37.136 --> 25:40.539
She lived
to five years?

25:40.640 --> 25:44.010
Big, long, full life.

25:46.112 --> 25:47.880
I'll be right back.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.481
YARA:
Dad?

25:49.582 --> 25:51.383
(cries)

25:51.483 --> 25:52.952
Was a lucky rat.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.287
Hey, hey, where you going?

25:57.056 --> 25:58.958
Look, my, uh...

25:59.058 --> 26:03.195
my wife wanted us all
to drive together,

26:03.295 --> 26:06.232
but I let the kids
take a separate car.

26:06.332 --> 26:09.135
(crying)

26:09.235 --> 26:12.872
Um... this is all my fault.

26:12.972 --> 26:14.874
(cries, sniffles)

26:14.974 --> 26:16.676
Uh, this is

26:16.776 --> 26:18.577
(echoing):
all my fault.

26:18.678 --> 26:19.979
All my fault. (crying)

26:20.079 --> 26:22.114
She tried to call me.

26:22.214 --> 26:24.116
I missed a call
from her, and she was...

26:24.216 --> 26:25.584
she was really trying...

26:25.685 --> 26:29.255
trying to call to have me
come pick her up instead...

26:29.355 --> 26:33.159
instead of Bode. (sobbing)

26:33.259 --> 26:35.862
And I didn't
answer the call.
Oh.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.864
(sniffles, cries)

26:37.964 --> 26:40.166
SHARON:
Bode.
Mom.

26:43.035 --> 26:44.637
(panting, gasps)

26:50.242 --> 26:51.610
What happened?

26:52.578 --> 26:54.380
What happened? Hmm?

26:54.480 --> 26:56.148
You drinking? You using?
Stop.

26:56.248 --> 26:57.483
You using again?
Stop it!

26:57.583 --> 26:58.751
No. No, Dad.

26:58.851 --> 27:00.219
Riley just...

27:00.319 --> 27:02.454
She tried to get out of the car,
and I reached over

27:02.554 --> 27:04.223
to pull her back in.

27:04.323 --> 27:05.291
Don't blame this on her!
SHARON:
No!

27:05.391 --> 27:07.293
This is you!
Hey! Hey!

27:07.393 --> 27:09.528
This is you!
Listen to me. Your family is
hurting enough already.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.263
You want to fight
somebody, you fight me.

27:11.363 --> 27:12.999
Fight me! Fight me!
No!

27:13.099 --> 27:18.270
Come here. It wasn't his fault.
Vince, look at me. Look at me.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.840
It was just an accident.

27:20.940 --> 27:25.411
If anything happens to my kids,
what do I do then?

27:26.779 --> 27:28.981
I'm not gonna let that happen.

27:30.182 --> 27:31.283
I promise.

27:31.383 --> 27:33.485
You get back to your family.

27:33.585 --> 27:35.487
They need you.

27:36.989 --> 27:40.559
Aren't we not supposed to be
promising outcomes to civilians?

27:40.659 --> 27:42.461
No, we're not.
Bode said
that this might

27:42.561 --> 27:45.131
be reminding Chief
of Riley's accident.

27:46.265 --> 27:47.566
Someone needs
to talk to Chief.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.169
No. No. If he's on edge,
it'll only make it worse.

27:50.269 --> 27:52.504
I mean, this rescue's
precarious as it is.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.675
Eve, if you have
a better idea, speak.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.612
I think we should talk to Bode.

28:03.315 --> 28:05.952
All right, Mom, Dad,
let's back up.

28:06.052 --> 28:07.920
(metallic creaking)
(Yara crying)

28:08.020 --> 28:09.956
Chief?

28:10.056 --> 28:12.859
The undercarriage of this car
is way too compromised.

28:12.959 --> 28:14.460
Never mind our anchor issues.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.095
This car is falling apart
with two lives inside of it.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.097
Well, the engine
will be here any minute.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.565
We don't have a minute, Chief.

28:19.665 --> 28:21.267
This is what I was
afraid of, this right here!

28:21.367 --> 28:23.002
Hey, the-the undercarriage
is crumbling.

28:23.102 --> 28:24.703
Shore it up, then!

28:24.804 --> 28:25.938
(gasps)

28:26.038 --> 28:27.874
(screaming)

28:27.974 --> 28:31.210
Oh, my God!
Help me, please!

28:36.983 --> 28:38.785
(screaming) Please help me!
All right, Mom, Dad,

28:38.885 --> 28:40.452
you got to get back.
I'm sorry. Go back!

28:40.552 --> 28:42.254
(others shouting)
Everybody, resecure your lines.

28:42.354 --> 28:43.923
Let's find another anchor point
on this car.

28:44.023 --> 28:46.893
Perez, attach the chain
to the other shock tower.

28:46.993 --> 28:50.462
Yara, listen to me.
I know you're scared.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.865
We are gonna get you
out of here, okay?

28:52.965 --> 28:54.333
How's-how's Sam doing?

28:55.001 --> 28:57.503
He-- he's still breathing.

28:58.337 --> 29:00.572
VINCE:
That's good.
That's really good.

29:00.672 --> 29:04.043
I will be right back,
okay?

29:04.143 --> 29:05.344
Okay.

29:06.345 --> 29:08.014
Deputy,
we need this road cleared now.

29:08.114 --> 29:09.515
We got to get
that engine up here.

29:09.615 --> 29:11.517
This car ain't gonna hold
much longer.

29:11.617 --> 29:13.119
(indistinct radio chatter)

29:13.219 --> 29:15.521
This accident...
It's Riley all over
again. I know.

29:15.621 --> 29:16.923
You okay?

29:17.023 --> 29:18.657
No, I'm fine, okay?
I'm here in the present, but--

29:18.757 --> 29:20.459
It's screwing with my dad's
head, with his planning.

29:20.559 --> 29:23.529
Jake, we need to pivot.
And the way this car
is leaning

29:23.629 --> 29:24.831
over the edge,
I'd agree with you.

29:24.931 --> 29:26.765
I say we move on to Cap's plan.

29:26.866 --> 29:28.434
Wait, wait, wait.
My dad's not thinking

29:28.534 --> 29:29.969
straight either.
Are we saying

29:30.069 --> 29:31.637
we have no clearheaded
leadership on this bridge?

29:31.737 --> 29:32.905
Seems that way.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.041
(exhales)
Do we call dispatch?

29:35.141 --> 29:37.576
And go over their heads?
Can we do that?

29:37.676 --> 29:38.911
No. No.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.579
We give Chief a chance
to hear us out.

29:40.679 --> 29:41.848
EVE:
Well, you should
do it alone, Jake.

29:41.948 --> 29:44.116
He'll listen to you.

29:44.216 --> 29:47.353
Hey, hey, he commended you
for your decisiveness.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.221
You know that Cap's plan
is the right one.

29:49.321 --> 29:50.722
Go get it.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.092
All right.

29:53.192 --> 29:54.426
Hey, hey. Yo.

29:54.526 --> 29:56.495
Thanks, Jake.

29:56.595 --> 29:57.496
Yeah.

29:57.596 --> 29:59.765
Hey, Chief...

29:59.866 --> 30:01.968
Are you ready to admit
that your plan failed?

30:02.801 --> 30:06.105
Manny, we go with your plan,
we get Yara out.

30:06.205 --> 30:08.841
Great. Then what?
We let Sam die?

30:08.941 --> 30:10.176
Of course not, Chief.

30:10.276 --> 30:11.510
We're gonna do everything
we can for Sam.

30:11.610 --> 30:12.611
'Cause the second
that engine's...

30:12.711 --> 30:13.712
Time's up on the engine, Chief!

30:13.812 --> 30:14.780
The car's falling apart.

30:14.881 --> 30:16.048
We need a plan B.

30:16.148 --> 30:19.085
Please, Chief.
Chief, Cap's right.

30:19.185 --> 30:21.687
It's not perfect, but it's
the best option right now.

30:21.787 --> 30:24.090
Once Yara's out,
we can reassess.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.559
You truly believe
that Manny's...

30:27.659 --> 30:30.096
Manny's plan
is better here, huh?

30:32.331 --> 30:33.465
Affirmative, Chief.

30:33.565 --> 30:34.901
Like I said,

30:35.001 --> 30:36.668
I know when to move on
a good idea.

30:38.804 --> 30:40.806
Come on, Chief.
All right...

30:42.641 --> 30:44.476
The minute that Yara's out
of there, we're going for,

30:44.576 --> 30:45.644
we're going for Sam, right?

30:45.744 --> 30:47.279
Okay?
Let's get to work.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.348
All right, firefighters,
with me. Come on.

30:49.448 --> 30:51.017
Come on, quick, quick,
quick, quick, quick.

30:51.117 --> 30:52.518
EVE: All right,
watch the chains.

30:52.618 --> 30:54.186
MANNY:
All right, here's
what's gonna happen.

30:54.286 --> 30:56.155
We're gonna pop that hatch
with the combi tool,

30:56.255 --> 30:57.990
we're gonna cut the hinges
with the recip saw,

30:58.090 --> 31:00.026
and we're gonna tent until
we get a spine board in, copy?

31:00.126 --> 31:01.693
(all agreeing)
Good. Let's get to work.
Let's go.

31:01.793 --> 31:04.163
Let's go to work.
GABRIELA: Don't you think
that seems risky?

31:04.263 --> 31:06.165
It's the only choice
we have right now, mija.

31:06.265 --> 31:07.733
And you can thank
your chief for that.

31:07.833 --> 31:09.335
We've lost too much time now
for a peel-and-peek.

31:09.435 --> 31:12.438
We have to go straight
to tenting the car.
Dad.

31:12.538 --> 31:13.639
Hey.

31:14.406 --> 31:15.774
Are you sure
you're up for this?

31:15.874 --> 31:17.309
Not the time for
a check-in, mija.

31:17.409 --> 31:18.978
Get to work.

31:22.148 --> 31:25.884
So, Lilly set me up with the
best nephrologist at UCLA.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.886
And I have a new
dialysis regimen,

31:27.987 --> 31:30.756
I have a new treatment plan
for my kidneys.

31:30.856 --> 31:34.326
Seriously, since the first time
I could admit how bad this was,

31:34.426 --> 31:36.262
I feel like I'm finally
turning a corner.

31:36.362 --> 31:37.863
Hmm.

31:39.765 --> 31:41.934
Turning the corner
is a good thing.

31:42.034 --> 31:44.303
Show me the smile
you love to flash.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.972
Yeah.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.806
I mean, Vince told me
that you were sick,

31:47.906 --> 31:50.642
but I didn't know
how bad it was,

31:50.742 --> 31:52.678
or how long it's been.

31:52.778 --> 31:54.180
I could have helped, Sharon.

31:54.280 --> 31:57.916
I didn't want anybody
in the department to know.

31:58.017 --> 31:59.885
Not even
my brother-in-law.

32:00.886 --> 32:02.321
I get that.

32:02.421 --> 32:03.990
You worked your ass off
to be division chief.

32:04.090 --> 32:07.960
Yeah. And then, I have
this little bit of time off,

32:08.060 --> 32:12.264
and I remember that the most
important thing is family.

32:12.364 --> 32:14.566
Yeah.
My son.

32:15.467 --> 32:19.171
It's like I got my kid
back from the dead, Luke.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.609
Losing Riley...

32:23.709 --> 32:25.811
You know, I'm just,
I'm never gonna be whole again,

32:25.911 --> 32:28.314
but this, this feels
pretty close.

32:28.414 --> 32:30.816
So... yeah.

32:30.916 --> 32:34.453
I-I used my position
to bend some rules.

32:34.553 --> 32:36.255
So there you go.

32:36.355 --> 32:37.856
If the board comes
sniffing around,

32:37.956 --> 32:39.858
you just say that.

32:39.958 --> 32:43.329
Because no one is gonna
argue with a Mama Bear.

32:44.296 --> 32:45.731
(chuckles)

32:45.831 --> 32:47.733
Okay.
So, see?

32:47.833 --> 32:51.603
Now you're prepared.
Okay. Thank you.

32:51.703 --> 32:54.106
(chuckles)
So...

32:54.206 --> 32:58.610
Manny bent the rules because
you told him you were sick.

32:58.710 --> 33:00.146
Yeah, see, I thought...

33:00.246 --> 33:03.149
What?
(chuckles)
No, it's silly.

33:03.249 --> 33:06.685
See, part of me honestly thought
that maybe you and Manny...

33:06.785 --> 33:09.421
Me and Manny were...
(laughs) Right?

33:09.521 --> 33:11.957
'Cause we both know if you're
shopping for an affair,

33:12.058 --> 33:13.359
I'm the first call
you'd make, so...

33:13.459 --> 33:15.594
(laughing)

33:20.132 --> 33:21.967
My brother's
a very lucky man.

33:27.039 --> 33:29.141
Luke, I love you
like a brother.

33:29.241 --> 33:31.810
And when I thought
you sold me out, I was hurt

33:31.910 --> 33:33.779
and angry and sad,
and got used to the idea

33:33.879 --> 33:35.081
of never having you
in my life again.

33:35.181 --> 33:36.515
And I don't want to
go back there.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.950
You don't have to, Sharon.

33:39.051 --> 33:40.286
You need to leave.
Shar--

33:40.386 --> 33:43.789
And we will never
discuss this again.

33:43.889 --> 33:46.525
With anyone.
Especially Vince.

33:47.793 --> 33:50.229
He would never
get over this.

33:50.329 --> 33:52.364
* *

33:56.435 --> 33:57.936
Yeah.

34:03.975 --> 34:05.877
Just get out.
Get out of my house.

34:05.977 --> 34:07.879
Sorry.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.551
(door closes)

34:18.457 --> 34:20.859
(whirring)
MANNY:
Easy, Jake.

34:20.959 --> 34:23.028
Good. Good.

34:27.099 --> 34:28.434
(grunts)
Nice. Go.

34:29.435 --> 34:30.336
Coming through.

34:30.436 --> 34:32.204
All right.

34:33.305 --> 34:35.507
MANNY:
Tent that roof even more.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.576
JAKE: All right, have
that backboard at the ready.

34:37.676 --> 34:38.910
All right, Yara.

34:39.010 --> 34:40.346
Here I come, okay?
(metallic creaking)

34:40.446 --> 34:42.248
I'm coming to get you.
Hi. Okay.

34:42.348 --> 34:43.549
Easy, Jake.
Okay, Yara.

34:43.649 --> 34:46.118
This is what I need you
to do, okay?

34:46.218 --> 34:48.220
Can you reach to the lever
on the side of the chair

34:48.320 --> 34:50.088
and help me let it down?
Okay.

34:50.189 --> 34:52.991
(groans)
There you go.
You got her? All right.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.127
MANNY:
Where's my spine board?

34:55.227 --> 34:56.995
I'm really happy to see you.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.798
That's mutual, Yara.

34:59.898 --> 35:01.400
All right.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.369
We're gonna lift you onto
the spine board, all right?

35:03.469 --> 35:05.804
Sam's next, right?
(groaning)
Yeah, we're working on him.

35:05.904 --> 35:07.739
Ready? Go.

35:07.839 --> 35:09.541
(grunting)
Ready?

35:09.641 --> 35:12.944
And go.
(grunting)
(groaning)

35:13.812 --> 35:14.813
There we go.

35:14.913 --> 35:17.483
One... and two.

35:17.583 --> 35:18.584
(creaking)

35:18.684 --> 35:21.353
(screaming)

35:21.453 --> 35:23.589
MANNY:
Hold on, hold on!

35:24.390 --> 35:26.358
What's happening?
Why'd you stop?!

35:26.458 --> 35:27.493
Hold still.

35:31.997 --> 35:33.899
(metallic creaking)

35:33.999 --> 35:35.367
MANNY:
All right. Go!

35:35.467 --> 35:37.503
(grunting)

35:38.237 --> 35:40.839
One, two... three.
(yells)

35:40.939 --> 35:43.442
(firetruck horn blares)

35:43.542 --> 35:46.178
(siren wails)

35:46.278 --> 35:49.014
(horn honking)

35:49.815 --> 35:51.217
Yara's almost out.

35:51.317 --> 35:53.385
It's a good thing, dude.

35:54.586 --> 35:56.087
Yeah, it is.

36:00.559 --> 36:02.594
Good job.
Gentle, guys, gentle.

36:02.694 --> 36:03.895
Well done.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.198
(Harriet sobbing)

36:06.298 --> 36:08.534
Yara! Sweetie!

36:08.634 --> 36:09.535
Chief!

36:09.635 --> 36:10.536
Oh, my God.

36:10.636 --> 36:11.803
SAMUEL SR.:
We're right here.

36:11.903 --> 36:13.539
JAKE:
Listen, guys.

36:13.639 --> 36:15.173
The ambulance is close enough
for us to push her to it, okay?

36:15.274 --> 36:16.408
MANNY:
Look, we're just gonna get Yara

36:16.508 --> 36:18.076
to the hospital.
All right? Let's go.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.345
And what about Sam?!

36:19.445 --> 36:20.979
We're gonna try
everything we can,

36:21.079 --> 36:22.881
and unlike my chief, I'm not
gonna make you any promises.

36:22.981 --> 36:26.017
So, please, once you're out
of here, stay in the safe zone.

36:26.117 --> 36:27.786
JAKE: Watch your back.
HARRIET: Okay.

36:28.987 --> 36:30.188
What?

36:30.289 --> 36:32.090
I know I shouldn't have
made that promise,

36:32.190 --> 36:33.759
but why do you got to
talk to the parents like that?

36:33.859 --> 36:36.828
I'm just telling them
like it is, Chief.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.530
You should've stuck to my plan.

36:38.630 --> 36:39.765
Your plan?

36:39.865 --> 36:41.400
Your plan is what wasted
the time we did have

36:41.500 --> 36:42.968
to do a peel-and-peek, Chief.

36:43.068 --> 36:44.403
Your plan is what made this

36:44.503 --> 36:46.405
already unlikely save
a complete Hail Mary.

36:46.505 --> 36:49.675
It's probably what's gonna
leave that family broken.

36:49.775 --> 36:51.710
You don't like the way
I talked to those parents?

36:52.778 --> 36:54.045
You go talk to them.

36:54.145 --> 36:56.248
Make another promise
you may not be able to keep.

36:56.348 --> 36:57.816
You're right.

36:59.951 --> 37:01.320
It should be me.

37:02.754 --> 37:04.089
Good.

37:04.189 --> 37:05.991
Your pop's
listening to reason.

37:06.091 --> 37:07.993
Then why is he going
the wrong way?

37:08.093 --> 37:10.996
Hey, hey, the parents,
the parents are that way, Dad.

37:11.096 --> 37:12.398
They're that way.

37:12.498 --> 37:15.233
So is your crew and
your captain. Fall back, Bode.

37:15.334 --> 37:17.536
Don't make this situation
any worse than it has to be.

37:17.636 --> 37:19.338
Worse? Worse would be you
trying to get in that car

37:19.438 --> 37:20.739
to get access to Sam.

37:20.839 --> 37:21.973
Only way to save her.
Her?

37:22.073 --> 37:23.875
Her? Dad...
Get off me, Luke!

37:23.975 --> 37:25.277
Hey! Hey! Dad!

37:25.377 --> 37:26.845
Dad...
VINCE: Bode.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.847
Let me go.
It's an order.

37:28.947 --> 37:31.483
It's not Riley in that car, Dad.

37:33.184 --> 37:35.186
It's not Riley.

37:37.122 --> 37:39.858
(crying):
It's not Riley.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.161
Look, this is hard
for me, too,

37:43.261 --> 37:45.531
but y-you have to
separate them.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.534
I know.

37:48.634 --> 37:49.801
Yeah.

37:49.901 --> 37:51.737
You're right.

37:53.905 --> 37:55.341
Riley's dead.

37:56.575 --> 37:58.176
Sam's not.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.211
Not if I can help it.

38:08.687 --> 38:10.656
Hey, I just saw that.
Are you okay?

38:10.756 --> 38:12.491
My dad's the one we need
to worry about.

38:12.591 --> 38:13.659
GABRIELA:
Okay, Jake and Eve are getting
Yara into the ambulance.

38:13.759 --> 38:15.060
I can radio them.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.563
No, no, this isn't Cal Fire.
This is family.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.798
It's between me and him.

38:19.898 --> 38:21.833
All right, it's gonna
take more than a shove

38:21.933 --> 38:23.101
to keep me away, Dad.
Hey.

38:23.201 --> 38:24.370
Hey, just let me--
let me do this!

38:24.470 --> 38:25.737
You'd rather
fall off a bridge

38:25.837 --> 38:28.440
than tell those parents
that we lost their kid.

38:28.540 --> 38:29.975
I get it.
But I also get

38:30.075 --> 38:33.078
that today we're firefighters
and not family members.

38:33.178 --> 38:35.313
And if this doesn't work out,
that family over there

38:35.414 --> 38:36.815
is gonna need a bad guy.

38:38.417 --> 38:39.785
And that's us.

38:40.552 --> 38:43.555
You did...
You did, after Riley.

38:43.655 --> 38:46.091
* *

38:46.191 --> 38:47.959
I hate him.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.061
(crying):
I hate him.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.397
Get it out.

38:51.497 --> 38:54.032
Better you say it to me
than anybody else.

38:54.132 --> 38:55.834
I hate my own kid. What...?

38:55.934 --> 38:57.936
What does that make me?

38:58.036 --> 38:59.270
I...

38:59.371 --> 39:03.775
I hate myself
for letting it get this far.

39:04.576 --> 39:06.344
And I hate you.

39:07.312 --> 39:09.280
You're his worst influence.

39:09.381 --> 39:13.385
You're right.
I'm the fun uncle.

39:13.485 --> 39:15.687
It was my job to give him
his first beer.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.623
You're not his parent!
(crying)

39:17.723 --> 39:20.492
I did the same thing
for Riley.

39:20.592 --> 39:22.461
He is not Riley.

39:26.432 --> 39:28.166
She's really gone, huh?

39:28.266 --> 39:30.035
She's really gone, isn't she?

39:30.135 --> 39:33.071
(sobbing): She's gone.

39:34.005 --> 39:35.974
Oh, God, my little girl.

39:38.744 --> 39:41.847
(panting)

39:47.052 --> 39:49.788
BODE:
Hey. Dad.

39:49.888 --> 39:50.889
Hey, stop.

39:50.989 --> 39:52.758
Hey, stop. Stop. Stop.
Back off!

39:52.858 --> 39:54.292
I can't.
I got to get in there.

39:54.392 --> 39:55.794
I got to save that kid.
I-I promised his parents.

39:55.894 --> 39:56.962
Look, if you try to
get in this car,

39:57.062 --> 39:58.497
you're gonna
upset the balance.

39:58.597 --> 40:01.066
You know, you might be able
to free Sam and push him out,

40:01.166 --> 40:03.735
but you're gonna push this car
over the edge with you in it.

40:05.437 --> 40:07.539
Well, I got to try.
I got to...
No, no.

40:07.639 --> 40:08.874
M-Mom can't lose you.

40:10.509 --> 40:12.410
She needs you.

40:12.511 --> 40:14.746
Okay, Mom-Mom needs you.

40:16.314 --> 40:18.484
And that family
is gonna need you.

40:18.584 --> 40:19.685
Because only you understand

40:19.785 --> 40:21.853
what they might be
about to go through.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.158
* *

40:27.258 --> 40:28.794
(sniffles)

40:28.894 --> 40:30.762
We work like hell

40:30.862 --> 40:33.932
to save Sam...
till it's over.

40:34.032 --> 40:37.035
One way or the other.
All right?

40:37.135 --> 40:39.771
I'll stay with the family
as long as I need to.

40:47.378 --> 40:49.414
SAM:
Hello?

40:49.515 --> 40:50.448
Where am I?

40:50.549 --> 40:51.850
Where am I?

40:51.950 --> 40:54.019
Sam. Sam?

40:54.119 --> 40:56.622
Look, Sam, you've been
in an accident.

40:56.722 --> 40:58.156
You know my name?

40:59.925 --> 41:01.860
W-Where's Yara?

41:01.960 --> 41:03.595
(sobbing):
Did I kill my sister?

41:03.695 --> 41:04.863
No. You d-- you didn't.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.165
She's safe, Sam.
She's okay.

41:07.265 --> 41:10.001
(panting)
Get me out of here!

41:10.101 --> 41:12.137
Sam, Sam, Sam,
you got to stay still.

41:12.237 --> 41:13.872
You got to stay still.
I'm about to fall
off a bridge!

41:13.972 --> 41:16.407
I'm getting out of here!
No, no, no. Sam, Sam.

41:16.508 --> 41:17.876
Sam, you moving
is making this worse.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.711
You may-- Stop!

41:19.811 --> 41:21.580
I don't want to die!

41:21.680 --> 41:23.849
Sam, stop!

41:23.949 --> 41:25.584
Bode, no, don't!

41:25.684 --> 41:27.152
Bode!

41:27.919 --> 41:29.621
Help me!
Get me out of here!

41:29.721 --> 41:30.756
Did he just get in the car?

41:30.856 --> 41:32.891
No, no, no, no!

41:35.126 --> 41:37.629
SAM: Are we gonna fall?
Sam. No. You won't.

41:37.729 --> 41:38.830
I'm not gonna let you, okay?

41:38.930 --> 41:39.831
Got your belt coming...

41:39.931 --> 41:40.999
VINCE:
Bode!

41:41.099 --> 41:42.300
Hey, hey,
what're you doing?

41:42.400 --> 41:43.669
What I should have
done before. Spoken up.

41:43.769 --> 41:46.071
Greencrest.
Switching to Command 18.

41:46.171 --> 41:47.639
SAM:
I'm stuck.

41:47.739 --> 41:49.174
No, you're okay, you're okay.

41:49.274 --> 41:51.710
Give me your arm.
(gasping)

41:51.810 --> 41:54.045
MANNY:
Damn it. Hey, where is
my second gurney?!

41:54.145 --> 41:57.549
We are on Ledgewood
and our leadership is exercising

41:57.649 --> 41:58.617
questionable judgment.

41:58.717 --> 41:59.918
I have an inmate firefighter

42:00.018 --> 42:02.053
hanging off the side
of a damn bridge.

42:02.153 --> 42:04.189
BODE: Come on.
VINCE: Bode!

42:04.289 --> 42:05.691
Please, help me, help me!

42:05.791 --> 42:07.092
Why would you do this?

42:07.859 --> 42:09.761
Help me, please.
Help me get him out, Dad!

42:09.861 --> 42:11.563
I had to stop him. Dad, just...

42:11.663 --> 42:13.565
Get him out now
or we're both gonna die

42:13.665 --> 42:14.633
and this was all for nothing.

42:14.733 --> 42:15.634
I got you, I got you.

42:15.734 --> 42:17.235
(metallic creaking)

42:17.335 --> 42:19.470
SAM:
Thank you, thank you!

42:19.571 --> 42:21.206
Come on.
JAKE:
I'm here, Chief.

42:21.306 --> 42:22.941
(crying):
Thank you, thank you.

42:23.041 --> 42:24.009
Here you go, Chief.

42:24.109 --> 42:25.310
I got him.
You got him?

42:25.410 --> 42:26.612
JAKE:
Get Bode, get Bode, get Bode.

42:26.712 --> 42:28.546
Move, move!
You're okay, buddy.

42:28.647 --> 42:29.547
VINCE:
Bode!

42:29.648 --> 42:31.149
Come here.

42:31.249 --> 42:33.351
This thing's about to go.
Come on. Take my hand.

42:34.152 --> 42:35.553
Dad!
Come on!

42:35.654 --> 42:36.822
Grab my hand, Bode!

42:36.922 --> 42:38.690
Just reach for it!

42:38.790 --> 42:40.491
Dad, I...
Come on!

42:42.728 --> 42:44.329
No, no, no, Bode!

42:45.530 --> 42:46.564
Bode!
