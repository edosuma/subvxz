WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:03.471
It's time to take a stand
with The Gifted.

00:03.504 --> 00:06.006
-People need something
to believe in.
-Ahh!

00:06.040 --> 00:08.076
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.977
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.010 --> 00:11.579
9-1-1, The Resident,

00:11.612 --> 00:12.880
and Lethal Weapon.

00:12.913 --> 00:15.749
-Hey, partner.
-Only on Fox.

00:18.252 --> 00:21.021
-Like us.
-We're gonna have a weird kid.

00:21.055 --> 00:24.225
(both laugh)

00:24.258 --> 00:26.894
If it's a girl,
we should call her Aurora.

00:26.927 --> 00:28.062
Aurora?

00:29.597 --> 00:32.100
JACE: I've been thinking about
the blackouts that hit DC.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.401
It had to be mutants.

00:33.434 --> 00:34.768
-There's no other explanation.
-J-Jace.

00:34.802 --> 00:37.004
I am begging you.
You have to move on.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.407
EVANGELINE: Any of you ever
heard the name Reeva Payge?

00:39.440 --> 00:40.774
She's one of the most powerful

00:40.808 --> 00:42.176
mutants still standing
after 7/15.

00:42.210 --> 00:43.677
She's preparing for war.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.746
(explosion)

00:45.779 --> 00:47.581
Your friends
are never coming back.

00:47.615 --> 00:49.016
(shouting)

00:49.049 --> 00:50.918
Back in Atlanta, we killed

00:50.951 --> 00:53.354
15 people,
but you and Mom have never

00:53.387 --> 00:55.389
-once talked about that day.
-Sorry.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.362
There's a mutant, goes by Erg.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.564
-Lives in the tunnels under DC.
-THUNDERBIRD: And he'll help?

01:03.597 --> 01:04.732
He might.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.867
CAITLIN: Don't you dare
give in to despair.

01:06.900 --> 01:10.138
ECLIPSE: My kid is so close.
Maybe I'm done being careful.

01:10.171 --> 01:13.874
Look, Dawn,
Daddy's saying hi. Dawn?

01:13.907 --> 01:15.543
Help, please!
Somebody help me, please!

01:15.576 --> 01:17.178
I need help!

01:18.579 --> 01:21.582
("Guerrero"
by Proyecto TQ playing)

01:35.296 --> 01:36.430
Ah-ah.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.970
(bell tolling)

01:53.381 --> 01:54.615
Hermana...

02:06.627 --> 02:08.629
*

02:10.864 --> 02:12.466
(man groans quietly)

02:28.216 --> 02:31.419
(coughing)

02:38.592 --> 02:40.828
(weakly):
Is that... Marcos?

02:42.062 --> 02:44.232
Sí, Papá.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.200
What do you want?

02:46.234 --> 02:48.302
They told me
you came here to die.

02:48.336 --> 02:49.570
I remember when you wouldn't be

02:49.603 --> 02:51.872
caught dead dying
in a place like this.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.408
Leave me be.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.611
(labored breathing)

03:02.082 --> 03:05.018
I made some calls.

03:05.052 --> 03:07.154
I can get you
into a nicer place.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.689
You shouldn't have come.

03:08.722 --> 03:11.392
The cancer center in Bogotá
has a specialist,

03:11.425 --> 03:12.860
the same one
the president went to.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.563
You think I need
your blood money?

03:15.596 --> 03:17.565
I think you need my help.

03:19.467 --> 03:23.371
(straining):
You whore your demon powers

03:23.404 --> 03:25.339
to the cartel...

03:25.373 --> 03:28.008
then you come here and try to

03:28.041 --> 03:29.543
buy my love?

03:29.577 --> 03:33.614
(heavy breathing)
Get out.

03:33.647 --> 03:36.250
You don't belong
in the house of God.

03:36.284 --> 03:38.886
No, I don't belong,
not like you.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.422
(chuckles)

03:41.455 --> 03:43.724
Un hijo de perra
who abandons his son.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.025
What kind of man would do...

03:45.058 --> 03:47.194
I didn't abandon you.
I gave you a choice.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.362
A choice? (speaking Spanish)

03:48.396 --> 03:49.597
The same choice
your mother made.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.400
To hide her powers?

03:52.433 --> 03:54.568
To live a lie?

03:54.602 --> 03:57.538
You drove her
into an early grave.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.341
At least she never had to see
what you became.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.447
-When I go to Heaven...
-Heaven?

04:06.480 --> 04:10.318
You might be able
to fool the sisters...

04:12.152 --> 04:15.255
...but we both know
where you're heading.

04:16.957 --> 04:18.959
*

04:27.468 --> 04:30.070
Is this a joke?
You want to bring Marcos here?

04:30.103 --> 04:32.573
My baby is sick. The doctor says
she might die without him.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.408
Does that sound
like a joke to you?

04:34.442 --> 04:36.577
Well, there are better options
than exposing our operation.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.145
And what exactly
are those options?

04:38.178 --> 04:39.913
I'm sorry I missed your
graduation from med school.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.582
Lorna, we all want what's best

04:41.615 --> 04:43.917
-for the baby, but...
-POLARIS: She's barely eating.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.420
She's sleeping too much.
If the machines don't work...

04:46.454 --> 04:48.589
Well, then we'll get
more machines.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.591
It's not like we're
hurting for resources.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.992
You can't deal with this?

04:52.025 --> 04:55.095
I've done everything
I can think of.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.930
This is the worst case
of jaundice I've seen,

04:56.964 --> 04:59.266
and normal light therapy
isn't working.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.301
Given the nature
of the father's powers,

05:01.335 --> 05:02.770
he could be the solution.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.005
Well, perhaps
we need another doctor.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.607
POLARIS: We don't have time
to sit around and argue.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.141
Marcos is the answer.

05:08.175 --> 05:11.645
Lorna's right.
The child needs her father.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.881
Get him.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.849
(grunts)

05:21.822 --> 05:23.557
Damn it.

05:23.591 --> 05:26.727
There's no guarantees, but if
we want to find Andy and Lorna,

05:26.760 --> 05:28.396
we need all the help we can get.

05:28.429 --> 05:31.064
I'm still hung up
on this dude's name. Erg?

05:31.098 --> 05:33.066
And he lives with his buddies
in the sewers?

05:33.100 --> 05:35.369
Let's meet him
before dismissing him.

05:35.403 --> 05:36.504
(door opens)

05:36.537 --> 05:39.006
Sorry I'm late.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.240
Caitlin is gonna be looking over

05:40.273 --> 05:41.542
the information
we got from Evangeline.

05:41.575 --> 05:42.810
I figured you and I
head downtown.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.845
-I can join you on that.
-No.

05:44.878 --> 05:45.846
You're gonna sit this one out.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.247
-What?
-You're a mess, Marcos.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.016
I can smell the booze
on your breath from here.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.217
Come on, I'm fine.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.219
What about your little
light show last night?

05:52.252 --> 05:55.456
All over the news.
What the hell were you thinking?

05:57.190 --> 05:59.693
The next time
you drunk-dial your ex,

05:59.727 --> 06:03.030
just make sure you don't include
the entire Eastern Seaboard.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.898
I know I shouldn't have done it.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.266
-I just...
-Get your head right.

06:06.299 --> 06:08.769
We'll need you soon enough.

06:10.438 --> 06:12.506
BLINK: So, John,
you want to tell me

06:12.540 --> 06:13.574
what's going on with you?

06:13.607 --> 06:15.709
What are you talking about?

06:15.743 --> 06:17.945
Ever since you got back
from seeing Evangeline,

06:17.978 --> 06:20.514
you've been weird, and...

06:20.548 --> 06:22.416
what's with the bruises?

06:22.450 --> 06:24.184
This? I just couldn't
get back to sleep.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.853
I was doing some training.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.756
So they're just your standard
"disappear into the

06:28.789 --> 06:30.691
middle of the night
because everything is just fine"

06:30.724 --> 06:32.392
kind of busted knuckles?

06:32.426 --> 06:35.963
If I hit something hard enough,
my skin breaks. I'm not a robot.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.365
Well, I've known you
for almost a year.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.867
You've punched
a fair amount of stuff,

06:39.900 --> 06:41.535
and you're freakishly tough,

06:41.569 --> 06:43.403
and I've never seen
your fingers like that.

06:43.437 --> 06:45.906
Clarice, it's fine.
They're gonna heal.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.374
I'm not worried
about your fingers.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.543
And before you smile

06:49.577 --> 06:52.913
that perfect smile and tell me
everything is fine,

06:52.946 --> 06:54.982
I'm pretty sure the whole point
of having a girlfriend

06:55.015 --> 06:56.617
is telling me this stuff.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.152
Come on.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.257
I-I don't know what to tell you.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.659
There's nothing wrong.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.565
Fine.

07:11.599 --> 07:14.635
*

07:37.390 --> 07:38.592
Hey.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.293
Hey, I got to run to Baltimore.

07:40.327 --> 07:42.863
Before you do, um,

07:42.896 --> 07:44.632
do you have a moment?

07:47.134 --> 07:49.436
Sure.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.839
I...

07:51.872 --> 07:55.776
Yesterday, um...

07:55.809 --> 07:59.847
the things I said...

07:59.880 --> 08:01.481
I went too far.

08:01.515 --> 08:04.017
So did I.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.088
I'm worried about Lauren.

08:12.359 --> 08:13.794
Last night,

08:13.827 --> 08:17.397
there was something in the air
with you two.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.232
This morning,
she-she's been off.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.835
I-I-I tried to talk to her,
but she would have any...

08:21.869 --> 08:24.838
Maybe she just wants
a moment alone.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.040
You haven't noticed anything?

08:27.074 --> 08:30.310
I mean, she's obviously
got a lot on her mind.

08:30.343 --> 08:34.381
Can you talk to her, please?
B-Before you go?

08:34.414 --> 08:36.483
Can I do it tonight?
Shatter is waiting for me

08:36.516 --> 08:38.085
in Baltimore
with the medical supplies.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.920
Okay, so why don't you bring
Lauren along?

08:39.953 --> 08:41.755
You can stop for ice cream.

08:41.789 --> 08:44.758
Or waffles.
Or waffles and ice cream.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.694
(chuckles softly)

08:46.727 --> 08:48.228
This is important.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.565
(sighs)

08:54.101 --> 08:55.402
(knocking on door)

08:55.435 --> 08:56.637
(door opens)

08:57.738 --> 08:59.206
Hey.

09:00.574 --> 09:02.876
Hi.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.278
-How's it going?
-(scoffs)

09:08.716 --> 09:10.718
I heard Marcos is coming.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.319
They're out looking for him now.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.890
Listen, are you sure
that's the best idea?

09:16.924 --> 09:19.259
I mean, 'cause I know
we talked about moving on...

09:19.292 --> 09:20.594
It's for Dawn.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.429
Okay, nothing's working.
We have to try.

09:22.462 --> 09:24.898
Do you really want to be here
when he comes?

09:24.932 --> 09:26.867
-I'm not leaving her.
-But you know it's just

09:26.900 --> 09:28.368
-gonna make it harder.
-Of course.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.739
But I would do anything
to save my daughter.

09:33.106 --> 09:36.476
I can handle a few minutes
in a room with Marcos.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.086
Do you think she's one of us?

09:47.621 --> 09:50.423
We won't know for sure until
she's old enough to manifest.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.429
But I know she's a fighter.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.935
(music playing faintly
over speakers)

10:05.505 --> 10:07.140
WAITRESS:
What is that thing?

10:07.174 --> 10:10.811
Uh, it's, uh, a baby rattle.
I made it.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.813
You trying to win
World's Best Dad?

10:12.846 --> 10:16.917
I don't think
I'm in the running.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.686
Chin up, sugar.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.793
VOICE:
Marcos...

10:28.295 --> 10:30.497
Marcos.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.505
-Marcos.
-Marcos.
-Marcos.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.474
-Marcos.
-Marcos.

10:42.509 --> 10:43.811
Marcos.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.048
-Marcos.
-Marcos.
-Marcos.

11:01.929 --> 11:04.331
VOICE:
It's been a while, Marcos.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.133
Still haven't learned to shave?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.401
-Try anything,
you'll be short a triplet.
-Easy.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.237
We're not looking for a fight.

11:10.270 --> 11:13.173
-Quite the opposite, actually.
-We need your help.

11:13.206 --> 11:16.009
My help?
In what world do you think...

11:16.043 --> 11:19.346
It's the baby.
There's something wrong.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.455
Sorry. Security.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.391
What's wrong with my kid?

11:31.424 --> 11:33.393
The sooner you put that on,
the sooner we'll get there,

11:33.426 --> 11:35.295
and the sooner you'll find out.

11:37.264 --> 11:41.101
-Well, that's not very nice.
-Well, stay out of my head then.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.703
Quite a storm brewing in there.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.572
Interesting that
you blame yourself.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.741
What am I thinking now?

11:49.709 --> 11:52.579
You want to redeem yourself
as a daddy?

11:52.612 --> 11:54.247
Then do as you're told.

11:58.418 --> 11:59.887
Good boy.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.759
(knock on door)

12:05.793 --> 12:07.394
A moment, Andrew?

12:07.427 --> 12:09.096
Yeah, of course.

12:11.264 --> 12:14.701
Kind of a big day to be
playing games, don't you think?

12:14.734 --> 12:17.871
Well, uh, they told me
Marcos was coming,

12:17.905 --> 12:19.372
so I figured I'd stay in here.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.242
-I stocked up for the day.
-Actually...

12:23.576 --> 12:25.879
I want you by my side
for his visit.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.414
Me?

12:29.316 --> 12:31.084
Don't you want, like,
a security team?

12:31.118 --> 12:33.386
No, I think it should be you.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.423
Yeah, it's just that...

12:38.625 --> 12:40.460
...me and... me and Marcos
were friends.

12:40.493 --> 12:44.131
Exactly. Anyone can stand up
to an enemy.

12:44.164 --> 12:48.101
But what happens when
you care about someone?

12:48.135 --> 12:52.139
When you've fought
and sacrificed with them?

12:54.207 --> 12:56.643
I need people
who are gonna be strong enough

12:56.676 --> 12:58.578
to stand up to their friends.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.948
I can count on you?

13:03.283 --> 13:04.651
Yeah.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.420
Definitely.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.057
Good.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.933
Do you think this whole thing

13:19.967 --> 13:21.434
was just Evangeline
messing with you?

13:21.468 --> 13:23.536
I mean, Erg lives in a tunnel.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.306
Just go there and find him.

13:26.339 --> 13:29.042
If there's a shot at getting
help down there, I'll take it.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.414
You think it's down here?

13:36.483 --> 13:38.118
THUNDERBIRD:
Yeah, that looks like it goes

13:38.151 --> 13:39.352
to the sewer, all right.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.754
(rats squeaking)

13:53.266 --> 13:55.135
You're not really
gonna touch the...

13:55.168 --> 13:57.637
Okay. That's gross.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.373
Really should have brought
some hand sanitizer.

14:00.407 --> 14:02.209
THUNDERBIRD:
We're on the right track.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.745
People came
through here recently.

14:05.778 --> 14:07.714
This way.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.898
-This way.
-You know, I've got an
amazing idea for this Erg guy:

14:24.932 --> 14:27.067
owning a fricking cell phone.

14:27.100 --> 14:31.171
Another idea?
Meet at a Starbucks and not a...

14:31.204 --> 14:33.873
moldy, dark labyrinth.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.708
That's strange.

14:35.742 --> 14:37.844
Something's wrong down here.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.846
What do you mean?

14:39.879 --> 14:41.915
Someone's trying to get us lost.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.559
Whoa.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.696
What the...?

14:56.729 --> 14:58.065
Whoa.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.302
(chuckles)
You coming?

15:02.335 --> 15:03.971
Do I have a choice?

15:05.438 --> 15:07.941
(under breath):
Okay.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.249
(sighs)

15:16.283 --> 15:18.651
(speed-dialing)

15:18.685 --> 15:20.053
(on voice mail):
Hey, it's Paula.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.055
Please leave a message,
and I'll call you back.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.424
-(beep)
-Hey, babe, it's me.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.261
Straight to voice mail
again, huh?

15:28.295 --> 15:30.230
You're missing out
on some amazing stories

15:30.263 --> 15:33.066
about highway diners.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.135
(sighs)
Look, I know how pissed off

15:35.168 --> 15:36.736
you must be about me
pursuing this,

15:36.769 --> 15:40.907
but I promise you, Paula,
it's gonna be worth it.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.842
I love you.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.712
-When the job is done.
-(beep)

15:48.615 --> 15:50.250
Sorry, but whoever you
talked to should have told you

15:50.283 --> 15:51.751
Lieutenant Rhodes
is real backed up.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.486
-The whole department is.
-No, it's fine.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.355
I can speak to someone else.
Who's the sergeant on duty?

15:55.388 --> 15:59.192
-Sir, I...
-Listen, I have information

15:59.226 --> 16:01.194
about mutant fugitives
in the area

16:01.228 --> 16:03.530
-and about that light incident
last night.
-Who are you with?

16:03.563 --> 16:06.333
(sighs)

16:06.366 --> 16:08.935
I'm just a concerned citizen.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.770
Well, we appreciate you
coming down,

16:10.803 --> 16:12.172
but the sarge is slammed.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.007
If you can just tell me
what you've got, I'll...

16:14.041 --> 16:15.775
No, this is more
than just a tip.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.111
I need to sit down with someone
and explain the whole situation.

16:18.145 --> 16:19.946
I'm sorry, but whatever you got,
I can pass along,

16:19.979 --> 16:21.614
but there's no way
you're getting back there.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.283
Look... I'm not just some dude
off the street. Okay?

16:23.316 --> 16:25.252
I used to be on the job.

16:26.886 --> 16:30.390
I lost my daughter on 7/15.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.025
I've got skin in the game.

16:32.059 --> 16:33.560
I promise you,
the sergeant will be

16:33.593 --> 16:35.262
extremely happy
that he sat down with me.

16:38.265 --> 16:40.633
Grab a seat over there.
I'll see what I can do.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.402
Thank you.

16:52.412 --> 16:56.249
Lauren, I know you're not
feeling particularly chatty,

16:56.283 --> 16:57.550
but what happened last night...

16:57.584 --> 16:58.918
I shouldn't have said
what I said.

16:58.951 --> 17:01.321
No, it's... (sighs)

17:01.354 --> 17:05.192
I wanted to know what was wrong.
I'm glad you told me.

17:05.225 --> 17:08.195
-But now you're upset.
I didn't mean...
-No, I'm not upset.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.896
That's not what I meant. I...

17:09.929 --> 17:12.165
-We have to be able to talk...
-(cell phone rings)

17:12.199 --> 17:14.667
I'm sorry. It's your mom.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.203
Hey, babe.
We have the supplies,

17:16.236 --> 17:17.837
and we're headed
back to you now.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.373
Okay, good. I-I was looking
for the files

17:20.407 --> 17:22.109
we put together
on the Inner Circle.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.544
They should be in the back.

17:24.577 --> 17:27.347
I know, but I can't even
find the file cabinet.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.581
Did we move it?

17:29.616 --> 17:31.518
Yeah, I'm sorry.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.386
I-I-I forgot to tell you.

17:33.420 --> 17:36.556
Um, I'm replacing it.
It's-it's-it's broken.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.057
Okay.

17:40.293 --> 17:41.894
What happened to the wall?

17:41.928 --> 17:43.963
REED:
What are you talking about?

17:45.132 --> 17:48.401
CAITLIN:
There's a crack.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.203
REED:
I'm sure it's nothing.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.205
All right, something strange
is going on here.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.440
Cait, can we talk
about this later?

17:53.473 --> 17:54.941
I have to go.

17:54.974 --> 17:57.377
(pants)

17:57.410 --> 17:59.379
-Dad, what's going on?
-It's-it's nothing.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.880
Dad, your hands!

18:00.913 --> 18:02.382
-Dad! Dad!
-No. No.

18:02.415 --> 18:05.652
Oh, my God! Dad!

18:06.419 --> 18:09.055
(gasping)

18:09.088 --> 18:10.923
Dad!

18:21.434 --> 18:23.436
Baby, are you okay?

18:25.438 --> 18:27.440
What happened?

18:29.276 --> 18:31.911
-What did you do?
-I'm not sure. It just...

18:31.944 --> 18:34.414
-it just fell apart.
-Dad.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.116
We have to get out of here
before anyone sees us.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.290
MAN:
Shut it down! Shut it down!

18:43.323 --> 18:45.858
-Shut it down!
-The supplies.
The medicine's black market.

18:45.892 --> 18:48.261
-We got to get it out.
-MAN: Hey! Did you hear that?

18:48.295 --> 18:50.029
MAN 2:
Yeah. It sounded like a crash.

18:50.062 --> 18:53.366
-Come on.
-WOMAN: I think
it was over there.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.135
Dad, that way--
we can get off the street.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.313
(train whistle blaring)

19:06.346 --> 19:09.316
MAN: This has got to be
some sort of mutant thing.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.517
Stay back.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.791
-(both panting)
-(train whistle blaring)

19:18.825 --> 19:21.294
I'm so sorry.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.162
I should have
pulled over sooner.

19:23.196 --> 19:26.533
It just caught me by sur...
Are you sure you're okay?

19:28.568 --> 19:30.437
Dad.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.473
You have powers.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.208
How long were you
going to hide this?

19:35.242 --> 19:37.477
It's not that simple.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.546
I just... I'm not exactly sure
what happened.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.848
You-you disintegrated
the steering wheel.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.319
Why didn't you tell us?

19:46.353 --> 19:49.822
(sirens wailing)

19:49.856 --> 19:51.224
We have to get out of here.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.828
We really should
have found someone by now.

19:55.862 --> 19:58.898
Well, maybe Erg moved
to the sub-Ergs.

20:00.433 --> 20:03.536
Okay. It's probably this way.
Come on.

20:05.238 --> 20:06.673
Are you sure?

20:06.706 --> 20:09.576
It kind of feels like
we're going in circles.

20:09.609 --> 20:12.379
Yup, we are. I recognize
that goop on the wall.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.715
THUNDERBIRD:
Damn it!

20:16.916 --> 20:18.217
(grunts)

20:19.619 --> 20:21.187
It's not just the illusions,
all right?

20:21.220 --> 20:22.755
There's something interfering
with my tracking.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.691
Maybe we should bail.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.259
Retrace our steps
back to the surface.

20:26.293 --> 20:27.927
No, we're not giving up!

20:27.960 --> 20:30.029
Look, I'm sorry.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.399
This is our only lead. Okay?

20:32.432 --> 20:34.401
If we don't find Erg,
we have nothing.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.068
Just...

20:39.639 --> 20:41.541
Just hang on a second.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.576
Let me try something.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.845
What?

20:48.247 --> 20:50.917
I can see energy fields
I use to portal.

20:53.252 --> 20:57.424
I can try and look past
what they want us to see.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.594
There.

21:01.628 --> 21:04.731
That's like
a couple hundred feet ahead.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.834
I can hear sounds.
Something's in there.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.840
(grunts, pants)

21:13.873 --> 21:17.076
MAN: You want to keep breathing,
don't move.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.345
(Blink gasps)

21:18.378 --> 21:20.780
-Don't try anything.
-(guns cocking)

21:22.281 --> 21:25.485
You're coming with us.

21:25.518 --> 21:27.854
JACE: I've got full files
on all these guys.

21:27.887 --> 21:30.923
If we share our resources, we
can round up this whole group.

21:30.957 --> 21:33.593
-You did all this research?
-Yeah.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.995
That, uh, green light
in the sky last night?

21:37.630 --> 21:39.599
Matches the abilities
of this guy, Marcos Diaz.

21:39.632 --> 21:40.933
He absorbs and emits light.

21:40.967 --> 21:44.404
I take it you were a cop
down in Georgia?

21:45.472 --> 21:47.607
Sentinel Services, actually.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.008
But I left all that
for the glamorous world

21:49.041 --> 21:50.610
of private security.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.612
My wife got tired of the
government paychecks, you know?

21:52.645 --> 21:54.280
Oh, I hear you there.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.849
District just cut
our budget again.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.618
All right, well,
when we catch these guys,

21:58.651 --> 22:00.653
I guess the drinks are on me.

22:00.687 --> 22:04.391
All right.
If you can keep it quiet,

22:04.424 --> 22:06.359
you can have a peek
at some of what we got,

22:06.393 --> 22:09.095
but you have to keep it
between us.

22:10.229 --> 22:12.298
Come on.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.401
There's got to be
more than this.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.403
DISPATCHER (over radio):
Reported 23158.

22:16.436 --> 22:17.870
Mutant-related incident
in Landover.

22:17.904 --> 22:20.139
Single vehicle.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.610
Requesting Mutant Forensics
in case of likely 504-M.

22:26.913 --> 22:29.215
Sorry for the unpleasantness,
Mr. Diaz.

22:29.248 --> 22:30.417
We had to take precautions.

22:30.450 --> 22:32.084
I'm sure you understand.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.756
I'm Reeva. I believe
you've met everyone else.

22:36.789 --> 22:38.725
Where's Lorna? They said
something's wrong with my baby.

22:38.758 --> 22:41.928
Your child has been diagnosed
with a severe case of jaundice.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.730
Now, normally,
this is easily treatable,

22:43.763 --> 22:45.097
but this case has been...
stubborn.

22:45.131 --> 22:46.699
Where are they?

22:46.733 --> 22:49.068
First you must understand:
you are a guest here.

22:49.101 --> 22:51.170
-We expect that you will...
-I don't care what you expect.

22:51.203 --> 22:54.040
My kid is sick. What are we
wasting our time for?

22:54.073 --> 22:55.508
When you see Lorna,

22:55.542 --> 22:57.343
your only conversation
will be about the child.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.045
-Is this chick for real? Andy?
-Marcos, bro,

22:59.078 --> 23:00.680
just listen to her.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.682
We didn't have to
bring you here, you know.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.952
Oh, I see how it is.

23:05.985 --> 23:08.220
Just be grateful
you're here, man.

23:08.254 --> 23:09.889
REEVA:
You will help the baby.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.290
And then you will leave.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.894
POLARIS:
We should try to wake her again.

23:14.927 --> 23:18.631
We just tried. At this point,
her system is overwhelmed.

23:18.665 --> 23:22.268
I'm just worried.
If this takes much longer...

23:26.906 --> 23:28.407
(gasps)

23:33.480 --> 23:36.883
-Thanks for coming.
-Yeah.

23:36.916 --> 23:40.720
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

23:40.753 --> 23:43.422
You know that we've been out
looking for you.

23:43.456 --> 23:44.591
Please.

23:46.092 --> 23:49.762
Don't make this harder
than it needs to be.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.399
You're here for Dawn.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.767
Dawn?

23:56.335 --> 23:57.904
Uh, you know, in Spanish...

23:57.937 --> 24:01.641
Her name would be Aurora.

24:01.674 --> 24:04.911
I believe you've been told
about the baby's condition.

24:04.944 --> 24:07.079
We've been trying to find
the right frequency

24:07.113 --> 24:08.681
for the light therapy, but...

24:08.715 --> 24:12.585
Please, just...
just give her to me.

24:12.619 --> 24:13.786
(baby coos)

24:23.129 --> 24:24.597
(Eclipse gasps)

24:24.631 --> 24:27.800
Hi. Hi.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.303
Hey, kiddo.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.440
(laughs)

24:34.473 --> 24:36.709
Oh, she's so beautiful.

25:08.775 --> 25:12.011
Can't you just do something
about them?

25:12.044 --> 25:13.580
Aren't you bulletproof?

25:13.613 --> 25:15.748
Yeah, but there are
five of them...

25:15.782 --> 25:17.516
and you're not bulletproof.

25:20.419 --> 25:23.155
Just stop.
That's far enough.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.692
ERG:
I hear we have visitors.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.865
Why are you here?

25:32.899 --> 25:34.834
THUNDERBIRD:
Evangeline Whedon sent us.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.570
She worked with the X-Men
and the Mutant Underground.

25:37.604 --> 25:39.205
I'm familiar with it.

25:39.238 --> 25:44.076
Look, we just
came down here to talk.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.979
All right. Let's talk.

25:48.047 --> 25:51.150
Not you. Her.

25:52.952 --> 25:55.688
No. We're together.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.389
She's not leaving.

25:57.423 --> 26:00.793
John, I can do this.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.567
(sighs)

26:12.338 --> 26:15.207
So what is it you want, exactly?

26:15.241 --> 26:19.378
Two of our friends were taken by
a group called the Inner Circle.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.547
We need to know
what they're doing.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.816
We heard you might
know something.

26:23.850 --> 26:26.819
You know, normally, I would just
dump the two of you

26:26.853 --> 26:29.221
on the surface and hide
that entrance to the tunnels.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.557
But as it happens,
I could use someone like you.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.592
What do you mean,
someone like me?

26:33.626 --> 26:37.930
Your portals, your connections.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.432
May I?

26:42.635 --> 26:44.771
Whether you know it or not,

26:44.804 --> 26:49.341
as a visible mutant,
you have a link to us down here,

26:49.375 --> 26:52.411
we who choose
not to hide our nature.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.080
Hmm.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.581
Maybe you misunderstood here.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.818
I'm sure your, uh,
sewer club is great,

26:58.851 --> 27:01.754
but we've got a job we're doing.
We're helping mutants.

27:01.788 --> 27:04.924
-You're helping mutants?
-Yeah.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.960
Let me show you something.

27:13.399 --> 27:15.301
(camera clicking)

27:16.468 --> 27:18.637
(indistinct radio chatter)

27:18.671 --> 27:20.272
Wow.

27:20.306 --> 27:21.941
That must have been
a crazy crash.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.176
-You guys see it?
-No, we were working over there.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.178
Heard the tires screech
and bang.

27:26.212 --> 27:30.783
Well, mutant forensics
showed up; must've been mutants.

27:30.817 --> 27:32.719
Wonder if they're still around.

27:32.752 --> 27:35.788
I don't think so. The car
was empty when we got here.

27:35.822 --> 27:38.224
(indistinct chatter)

27:47.666 --> 27:49.802
(grunts)

27:49.836 --> 27:51.003
(panting)

28:01.113 --> 28:02.882
(grunting)

28:07.419 --> 28:09.756
-(engine starts)
-Let's go!

28:09.789 --> 28:10.890
Get in!

28:10.923 --> 28:12.892
-No.
-What are you doing?

28:12.925 --> 28:14.761
You're in no shape to drive.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.366
Son of a bitch.

28:20.399 --> 28:21.768
(tires squealing)

28:33.079 --> 28:35.714
-Wow. What is this place?
-Welcome...

28:35.748 --> 28:38.584
to the real underground.

28:38.617 --> 28:41.253
These are our people,
the Morlocks.

28:41.287 --> 28:44.723
Mutants living open
and unafraid.

28:44.757 --> 28:48.060
Those of us who can pass
in the world above,

28:48.094 --> 28:52.431
we brand ourselves...
with these.

28:52.464 --> 28:56.435
We choose not to look like them.
We choose freedom.

28:56.468 --> 28:59.405
We're fighting for freedom, too.
Since the X-Men gave...

28:59.438 --> 29:01.440
The X-Men didn't fight
for freedom.

29:01.473 --> 29:04.043
They fought for tolerance.
You know what people tolerate?

29:04.076 --> 29:05.878
The things they hate.

29:05.912 --> 29:08.080
That doesn't mean
it's not worth fighting for.

29:08.114 --> 29:10.749
(scoffs)

29:10.783 --> 29:13.585
Tell that to Mara.

29:16.155 --> 29:19.258
She lived in Fairfield,
went to school.

29:19.291 --> 29:22.161
Her family wanted her
to grow up normal,

29:22.194 --> 29:24.596
but Mara wasn't normal.
(chuckles softly)

29:24.630 --> 29:28.234
She used sound to get around,
like a bat.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.569
But one day,
some Purifiers heard her,

29:30.602 --> 29:33.239
decided her clicks
might be dangerous.

29:33.272 --> 29:38.010
They beat her,
then they cut out her voice box.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.748
My mission is
to protect my people.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.851
Nothing more, nothing less.
You want my help?

29:44.884 --> 29:48.087
-Then help us.
-What do you mean?

29:48.120 --> 29:50.089
I have information you want.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.591
In exchange, I need assistance.

29:52.624 --> 29:55.027
And eyes in the world above.

29:55.061 --> 29:57.997
Are you asking me to be a spy?

30:06.805 --> 30:09.775
Listen, about the situation.
With my pow...

30:09.808 --> 30:11.443
Your powers.

30:11.477 --> 30:14.046
Yeah.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.782
I don't think we should
tell your mom for now,

30:16.815 --> 30:18.817
with everything
she's going through.

30:18.851 --> 30:20.119
Are you serious?

30:20.152 --> 30:22.521
What happened to
"no more secrets"?

30:22.554 --> 30:24.356
You said it yourself, Lauren.

30:24.390 --> 30:27.293
Our family's a mess right now.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.395
-I don't want to
make it any worse.
-You don't get it.

30:29.428 --> 30:33.065
Hiding stuff like this...
that's why we're a mess.

30:33.099 --> 30:36.402
-Lying to each other.
-I'm not lying to her.

30:36.435 --> 30:39.171
I'm trying to figure out
what is happening.

30:39.205 --> 30:41.540
Remember sophomore year,

30:41.573 --> 30:45.011
when you picked me up
from that party at Emma's?

30:45.044 --> 30:48.314
Where those mutants came by,
broke all the windows?

30:48.347 --> 30:50.016
Yeah.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.717
You were terrified.

30:53.085 --> 30:57.256
I was... but not why you think.

31:00.292 --> 31:03.896
I broke those windows
with my powers.

31:05.932 --> 31:09.768
Some boy was trying
to grab me, so...

31:09.801 --> 31:12.171
What?

31:12.204 --> 31:13.739
Lauren...

31:13.772 --> 31:18.177
He backed off as soon as stuff
started breaking.

31:18.210 --> 31:22.581
But, God, I was so freaked out.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.350
Could barely dial the phone
to call you.

31:24.383 --> 31:27.253
-Why didn't you tell me?
-I was going to.

31:27.286 --> 31:29.355
You gave me a big hug.

31:29.388 --> 31:32.258
We got in the car.

31:32.291 --> 31:34.426
You told me not to worry...

31:34.460 --> 31:37.396
because your job
was prosecuting mutants.

31:39.231 --> 31:42.234
You told me you'd protect me.

31:43.235 --> 31:46.105
From them.

31:54.947 --> 31:57.216
I'm sorry, baby.

31:57.249 --> 32:00.086
After that,
I never said anything

32:00.119 --> 32:02.754
because I didn't want to...

32:02.788 --> 32:05.224
didn't want to hurt you.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.892
Or our family.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.428
(scoffs)

32:09.461 --> 32:11.497
But what if I had?

32:14.033 --> 32:16.602
Maybe things
would be different with me.

32:18.004 --> 32:19.938
With Andy.

32:23.142 --> 32:26.212
Maybe none of this
would have ever happened.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.729
Clarice. You all right?

32:44.963 --> 32:47.599
-Yeah. I talked to Erg.
-And?

32:47.633 --> 32:49.335
Did he know something
about the Inner Circle?

32:49.368 --> 32:52.938
Do you remember that green goop
that we saw on the walls?

32:52.971 --> 32:55.441
There's a mutant down here
who watches places through it.

32:55.474 --> 32:58.610
He said that the Frosts were
in a utility tunnel

32:58.644 --> 33:00.179
with some city workers.

33:00.212 --> 33:01.780
They were tapping into
a data cable

33:01.813 --> 33:04.683
-under the Health Department.
-The Health Department?

33:04.716 --> 33:06.718
-Yeah.
-Did he say why?

33:07.986 --> 33:09.555
No, that's all they know.

33:12.391 --> 33:15.327
Can we, uh...
can we get out of here?

33:20.266 --> 33:22.268
All right, come on.

33:23.869 --> 33:25.337
(device trills, beeps)

33:33.745 --> 33:35.814
Bilirubin levels
are back to normal.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.015
We can take it from here.

33:39.085 --> 33:41.053
-Uh, shouldn't...
shouldn't we check...
-I said...

33:41.087 --> 33:42.454
we can take it from here.

33:45.891 --> 33:47.759
Mr. Diaz, please.

33:57.969 --> 34:00.072
Thank you.

34:01.773 --> 34:05.244
I-I, um... I made this for her.

34:05.277 --> 34:06.712
Kept it with me.

34:11.783 --> 34:14.453
When you left, in Nashville,

34:14.486 --> 34:18.390
I-I didn't want anyone
to get hurt, so I let you go.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.527
I was wrong.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.229
I should have figured out
another way to...

34:23.262 --> 34:25.564
-Marcos, please.
-Come with me.

34:25.597 --> 34:27.533
They've got money.
They've got all this.

34:27.566 --> 34:29.368
But I love you.

34:29.401 --> 34:31.537
And I love Dawn.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.739
And you love me.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.907
You know it's true.

34:35.941 --> 34:38.544
Of course I love you.

34:38.577 --> 34:43.149
But our daughter needs more
than love.

34:43.182 --> 34:46.017
We're building something here.
Something for Dawn.

34:47.319 --> 34:51.157
Then... then, uh, uh,
I-I can stay.

34:51.190 --> 34:53.925
Whatever it is you guys are
doing, I'll do it with you.

34:53.959 --> 34:55.561
We both know that wouldn't work.

34:55.594 --> 34:59.398
-You wouldn't fit in here.
-It doesn't matter.

34:59.431 --> 35:02.601
Real men don't abandon their...

35:03.869 --> 35:06.738
Marcos, you're not your father.

35:06.772 --> 35:09.775
-Please. It doesn't have to...
-It's time to go.

35:09.808 --> 35:11.510
Just give me a minute. I just...

35:11.543 --> 35:14.112
We said it's time to go.

35:25.624 --> 35:27.359
(beep)

35:27.393 --> 35:29.728
Lights out.

35:33.399 --> 35:34.633
(grunts)

35:36.468 --> 35:38.036
No.

35:38.069 --> 35:41.440
(panting)

35:41.473 --> 35:45.344
Lorna, they're lying to you!

35:45.377 --> 35:48.547
-They're in your head!
-Marcos, that's enough.

35:48.580 --> 35:52.117
Don't let them do this
to our family!

35:52.150 --> 35:54.520
Marcos, don't do this.

35:54.553 --> 35:55.621
(yells)

35:55.654 --> 35:57.423
(grunting)

35:58.990 --> 36:01.092
-(screams, yelps)
-(grunts)

36:06.365 --> 36:09.201
-ECLIPSE: Andy, get back.
-(emitting high-pitched tone)

36:09.235 --> 36:11.437
(grunting)

36:27.386 --> 36:29.955
(screaming)

36:32.891 --> 36:35.026
(tone stops)

36:35.060 --> 36:36.462
Are we done?

36:39.130 --> 36:43.435
Andrew, help your friend
to the door.

36:53.945 --> 36:56.248
Sergeant, I just spotted two
of the fugitives

36:56.282 --> 36:57.549
I've been tracking in the area.

36:57.583 --> 36:58.884
What do you mean,
you spotted them?

36:58.917 --> 37:00.252
There was an accident
in Landover.

37:00.286 --> 37:01.753
The vehicle was abandoned,
but I checked the block.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.422
I saw two people that looked
a hell of a lot

37:03.455 --> 37:05.023
like Reed and Lauren Strucker.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.025
Hold on. What were you doing
at an accident site?

37:07.058 --> 37:08.860
I overheard the dispatch when
I was checking out your files.

37:08.894 --> 37:10.028
Listen, we need to move quickly.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.564
There is no "we," Mr. Turner.

37:12.598 --> 37:14.600
I'm going to have to ask you
to leave.

37:14.633 --> 37:15.701
What are you talking about?

37:15.734 --> 37:17.769
I made some calls.

37:17.803 --> 37:19.305
We know about what went down
in Atlanta.

37:19.338 --> 37:22.441
That's a...
That's a long story.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.610
That starts with you getting
thrown out of Sentinel Services?

37:24.643 --> 37:26.412
Actually, I quit.
They were trying to blame me...

37:26.445 --> 37:27.879
They gave me the rundown on you.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.715
The unprofessional behavior.

37:29.748 --> 37:32.217
The frivolous reports about
dead mutant fugitives...

37:32.250 --> 37:34.420
Listen to me!
They're not dead!

37:36.455 --> 37:39.458
They're not dead.
I just saw...

37:39.491 --> 37:43.895
Mr. Turner, just... stop.

37:43.929 --> 37:46.598
I've already informed
the department.

37:46.632 --> 37:49.501
It's time for you to go home.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.640
(sighs)

37:56.107 --> 37:58.344
*

37:58.377 --> 38:00.779
(indistinct chatter)

38:09.888 --> 38:12.090
THUNDERBIRD: If we can figure
out what the Inner Circle

38:12.123 --> 38:13.525
got from the Health Department,

38:13.559 --> 38:15.961
then maybe we can
do something with this.

38:15.994 --> 38:20.165
Yeah. Sounds good.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.535
When you were with Erg...

38:25.404 --> 38:27.773
...what happened?

38:27.806 --> 38:30.275
He just, uh, showed me around.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.110
You know, there's a whole
society down there.

38:32.143 --> 38:36.682
Yeah, but he didn't exactly seem
enthusiastic about helping us.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.283
I talked him into it.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.452
What else could I do?

38:40.486 --> 38:43.855
Like you said, we couldn't
go home empty-handed.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.627
John...

38:48.660 --> 38:51.863
you're so desperate for answers
that I...

38:51.897 --> 38:53.799
I don't even know
what's going on with you.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.333
We already talked about this.

38:55.367 --> 38:57.202
Well, if there's something
wrong with us,

38:57.235 --> 38:59.204
-then you should just say...
-It's not... it doesn't...

38:59.237 --> 39:01.206
-Then what it is?
-It's not us.

39:04.910 --> 39:07.713
Please.

39:09.781 --> 39:11.650
When I...

39:11.683 --> 39:14.352
when I went to see Evangeline,
she told me something.

39:14.386 --> 39:16.688
She told me I failed,

39:16.722 --> 39:18.524
and she said that

39:18.557 --> 39:22.728
Lorna and Andy are never gonna
get out of the Inner Circle.

39:25.230 --> 39:27.766
That we're probably
gonna have to kill them.

39:28.934 --> 39:31.870
Clarice, this is my fault.

39:31.903 --> 39:35.373
Oh, wow, I'm sorry,
I didn't... know.

39:38.109 --> 39:40.278
I keep thinking about it.

39:42.080 --> 39:45.851
If it's true, I-I don't even
know if I could do that.

39:45.884 --> 39:48.353
-But I...
-What's wrong?

39:48.386 --> 39:50.188
-What is it?
-Someone's coming.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.357
Hey. Marcos.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.725
Hey. What happened?

39:53.759 --> 39:55.761
They came for me.

39:55.794 --> 39:57.929
And they-they took me
to the baby.

39:57.963 --> 39:59.565
Oh, my God.

39:59.598 --> 40:01.567
-(panting)
-Hey. Hey, don't talk.
Just rest.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.234
I-I don't want to rest.

40:03.268 --> 40:05.236
(panting)

40:05.270 --> 40:08.440
I want to hit them back.

40:10.308 --> 40:12.277
(quiet chatter)

40:22.921 --> 40:24.122
Hey.

40:24.155 --> 40:26.124
Hey. What took so...

40:26.157 --> 40:27.559
Oh, my God, Reed.
What happened?

40:27.593 --> 40:29.094
Lauren and I got into
a small accident.

40:29.127 --> 40:31.162
-What?
-Don't worry. She's fine.

40:31.196 --> 40:33.131
-Where is she?
Why didn't you call...
-Cait.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.034
There's something else.

40:38.637 --> 40:41.106
Something I've been
struggling with.

40:44.976 --> 40:48.213
Reed, what's going on?

40:51.116 --> 40:52.350
(Reed exhales)

40:52.383 --> 40:54.019
My father thought that

40:54.052 --> 40:57.255
he had suppressed my powers
permanently.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.190
What?

40:59.224 --> 41:01.560
Turned out he was wrong.

41:03.194 --> 41:05.664
I don't know what's happening.

41:05.697 --> 41:08.033
I destroyed the file cabinet,

41:08.066 --> 41:11.302
the dashboard of the car.

41:11.336 --> 41:13.371
They just crumbled
under my touch.

41:13.404 --> 41:16.441
My wedding ring's gone.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.143
How long has this been going on?

41:18.176 --> 41:20.445
I've been getting the headaches
since Andy left.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.280
That was six months ago.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.382
You didn't think of telling me?

41:24.415 --> 41:26.618
I thought I'd be able
to get them under control.

41:26.652 --> 41:29.054
I had headaches like that
when I was a kid.

41:29.087 --> 41:31.523
So I started reading
my dad's research.

41:31.557 --> 41:34.292
I thought, if he could
stop them, maybe I could, too.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.127
So I started doing things.

41:36.161 --> 41:37.896
Everything I could think of
to make it...

41:37.929 --> 41:40.231
You could have come to me.

41:40.265 --> 41:42.267
I know.

41:43.935 --> 41:46.171
I'm sorry.

41:48.439 --> 41:51.076
I don't know what I'm doing.

41:51.109 --> 41:53.579
-Reed...
-I don't know what's happening.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.918
(panting)

42:07.025 --> 42:09.027

42:32.250 --> 42:34.252
(coos)

42:36.421 --> 42:38.389
Marcos is stubborn, you know.

42:38.423 --> 42:39.557
He's not gonna give up.

42:39.591 --> 42:41.392
Yes, I can see that.

42:41.426 --> 42:42.928
How'd he get free?

42:42.961 --> 42:44.596
We can put thoughts
in people's minds,

42:44.630 --> 42:46.698
but it's hard to overcome
a feeling that strong.

42:46.732 --> 42:49.434
Our lives might have been easier
if you'd just finished him off.

42:49.467 --> 42:52.070
And that's why
you're not in charge.

42:52.103 --> 42:54.740
You must remember that our plans
are bigger than him.

42:54.773 --> 42:57.408
They're bigger than any of us.

42:57.442 --> 42:59.477
We are creating
something special.

43:02.848 --> 43:05.083
Now let's get to work, girls.

43:05.116 --> 43:06.952
This revolution's
not going to start itself.

43:18.096 --> 43:21.099

Media Access Group at WGBH

43:47.458 --> 43:49.594
It's time to pick a side
on The Gifted.

43:49.627 --> 43:51.897
Here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

43:54.032 --> 43:55.233
Buckle up, buttercup.

43:57.568 --> 43:59.938
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

43:59.971 --> 44:03.508
-* We're breaking waves
shooting star *
-(siren wailing)

44:03.541 --> 44:07.112
* We live for glory
not forever *

44:07.145 --> 44:08.146
MAN: Touchdown!

44:08.179 --> 44:11.717
* Reach out *

44:11.750 --> 44:15.353
* Make this right here
right now *

44:15.386 --> 44:18.323
* Stand up *

44:19.190 --> 44:20.959
* Here right now *

44:20.992 --> 44:22.928
That sounds like fun.
