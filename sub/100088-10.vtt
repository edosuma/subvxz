09:53.462 --> 09:56.639
our friendly frog hog over here
would fit the bill perfectly.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.859
Maybe he's looking for strings.

09:58.902 --> 10:01.601
Are you looking
for strings? Are you?Yeah. Hmm?

10:02.602 --> 10:03.820
There it is.

10:03.864 --> 10:05.692
I'm looking for shots.[laughs]

10:07.041 --> 10:08.695
All right, fine.
You're unbreakable.

10:08.738 --> 10:11.654
Yeah, yeah. Checkmate.But...
[laughs]

10:11.698 --> 10:14.657
if you're not all in
with someone,

10:14.701 --> 10:17.486
you might as well be all out.Look at you, huh?

10:17.529 --> 10:18.748
Just handing out
relationship advice

10:18.792 --> 10:19.749
like you're, uh,

10:19.793 --> 10:21.664
Dr. Phil.[laughs]

10:21.708 --> 10:24.885
What can I say?
Failure makes me an expert.

10:24.928 --> 10:28.105
But you did just use
the word "relationship."

10:28.149 --> 10:29.541
RAY:
You did.

10:29.585 --> 10:32.283
[grunts]

10:32.327 --> 10:34.329
[Sonny whistling]

10:37.941 --> 10:39.203
What's with them eyes, man?

10:39.247 --> 10:41.553
You're looking
well-rested.

10:41.597 --> 10:43.251
Is that because

10:43.294 --> 10:45.383
Vic discharged his duties
or 'cause he laid a turd?

10:45.427 --> 10:46.733
Oh, he laid a turd, man.

10:46.776 --> 10:48.256
He did,
but, uh,

10:48.299 --> 10:50.301
I managed to bag
an HVT 'cause Sonny

10:50.345 --> 10:52.652
is too sexy to fail.

10:54.305 --> 10:56.307
Hey, we, uh,
we missed you last night.

10:56.351 --> 10:57.744
Where were you?

10:57.787 --> 10:59.267
Work.

11:03.445 --> 11:05.186
All right, celebration's over,
listen up!

11:07.057 --> 11:08.885
This is Yevgenny Kostarov.

11:08.929 --> 11:10.844
Russian arms dealer
funneling weapons

11:10.887 --> 11:13.629
on a ratline that runs
from China to Iran.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.457
SONNY:
Russia, China, Iran.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.547
If I've got a North Korea there,
I've got myself a bad-guy bingo.

11:18.590 --> 11:20.549
DAVIS: Latest intel has
him at a safe house

11:20.592 --> 11:22.203
in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

11:22.246 --> 11:25.554
He is a key HUMINT asset
in unraveling a major network.

11:25.597 --> 11:27.077
We need him brought in alive.

11:27.121 --> 11:28.949
Uh, you know that depends
on how easy he makes it.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.472
And they rarely
make it easy.

11:30.515 --> 11:32.256
What kind of resistance
are we looking at?

11:32.300 --> 11:34.215
Kostarov travels everywhere
with two armed guards.

11:34.258 --> 11:36.086
And he's drafted
a handful of locals.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.827
So, we're probably think...[door opens]

11:37.871 --> 11:39.742
Ensign Davis.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.570
A word, please?

11:53.321 --> 11:54.844
Okay.

11:54.888 --> 11:57.325
What the hell does
Ops O want with Davis?

11:57.368 --> 11:59.719
Wish I knew.

12:05.333 --> 12:07.074
Look, all I'm saying, there's
a lot of reasons why they

12:07.117 --> 12:08.728
want to talk to her, that's all.Yeah, but what the hell's

12:08.771 --> 12:10.294
so important that they pull
Davis out of a warno?

12:10.338 --> 12:12.253
They don't really
expect us to spin up

12:12.296 --> 12:14.255
without our intel officer?Gentlemen.

12:14.298 --> 12:15.996
I will talk to
the operations officer

12:16.039 --> 12:18.433
and let you know what I can
after we are done here.

12:18.476 --> 12:20.304
In the meantime, let's focus up.

12:20.348 --> 12:24.221
Along with his armed guards,
Kostarov uses Dhaka locals

12:24.265 --> 12:26.397
for additional security.

12:26.441 --> 12:28.617
Uh, and-and this
is a safe house, right?

12:28.660 --> 12:30.445
Not a, not a storage depot.

12:30.488 --> 12:32.708
There's, uh, not a
weapons cache on site?

12:32.752 --> 12:35.406
Intel suggests he keeps
his merchandise elsewhere.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.017
All right, no hostage
rescue here, huh?

12:37.060 --> 12:39.802
It's just a straight-up
direct action?

12:39.846 --> 12:41.717
It's slow, quiet,
barricaded movement.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.851
We got a partner force to, uh,
set up a perimeter, correct?

12:44.894 --> 12:46.287
Yep.
All right.

12:46.330 --> 12:47.288
Offset infil.

12:47.331 --> 12:49.333
Patrol to target.In and out.

12:49.377 --> 12:50.595
Be home before bedtime.

12:50.639 --> 12:51.727
ERIC:
All right, we're wheels up

12:51.771 --> 12:52.859
in an hour.

12:52.902 --> 12:55.339
[indistinct chatter]

12:55.383 --> 12:57.037
I'll try to get
some answers on Davis.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.691
Okay, ASAP.

13:02.346 --> 13:04.044
You're going
somewhere in a hurry.

13:04.087 --> 13:05.828
Yeah, well, it's the first
time I'm spinning up since

13:05.872 --> 13:08.309
I got injured, so we'll see
how good your work really is.

13:08.352 --> 13:10.528
You put in the time
and your hip's healed.

13:10.572 --> 13:12.095
My money's on
mission success.
Yeah.

13:12.139 --> 13:14.315
Unless you and the guys raised
too much hell last night.

13:14.358 --> 13:16.752
Wow, this is weird to
be rooting for the guy

13:16.796 --> 13:18.406
that I'm dating
to head into battle.

13:18.449 --> 13:20.147
You weren't really upset
that I didn't

13:20.190 --> 13:21.365
let you come with us,
were you?

13:21.409 --> 13:23.498
No, I really
wasn't.
All right.

13:23.541 --> 13:25.021
I mean, you want to stay
off Bravo's radar,

13:25.065 --> 13:27.328
I feel the same way
about DEVGRU.

13:27.371 --> 13:28.546
You do?

13:28.590 --> 13:29.896
Yeah.

13:29.939 --> 13:31.636
I mean, people here
still question

13:31.680 --> 13:33.421
whether my role
is even necessary.

13:33.464 --> 13:35.553
It's kind of hard to win
them over if they see me

13:35.597 --> 13:37.642
as Jason Hayes' girlfriend
rather than

13:37.686 --> 13:40.384
as a medical professional
with invaluable expertise.

13:40.428 --> 13:42.952
And besides, we're having fun.

13:42.996 --> 13:45.259
There's no reason to
ruin it with a spotlight.

13:45.302 --> 13:47.870
We're having fun, huh?

13:47.914 --> 13:51.134
Right, well, unfortunately,
I got, I got to go work.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.962
Yes, you do.Mm-hmm.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.746
Just be safe out there.

13:54.790 --> 13:56.966
And take care of yourself.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.838
I will.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.404
LEE:
Ensign Davis,

14:00.448 --> 14:01.579
you've been accused
of assaulting a member

14:01.623 --> 14:03.364
of local law enforcement,
a violation

14:03.407 --> 14:05.670
constituting conduct
unbecoming an officer.

14:05.714 --> 14:07.585
This board will
review the events,

14:07.629 --> 14:09.457
allow you the opportunity
to explain them,

14:09.500 --> 14:11.851
and make a recommendation
to the XO.

14:11.894 --> 14:14.679
As this misconduct is
too serious to be handled

14:14.723 --> 14:17.117
administratively, the XO
will decide whether or not

14:17.160 --> 14:18.727
a court marshal
is in order,

14:18.770 --> 14:21.295
or to take punitive action
under the UCMJ Article 15,

14:21.338 --> 14:22.905
non-judicial
punishment.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.689
Do you understand
why you're here?

14:24.733 --> 14:26.082
Yes, sir.

14:26.126 --> 14:28.606
Eric?

14:28.650 --> 14:30.913
Ensign Davis,
please relax.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.657
According to the New
Jersey police report,

14:35.700 --> 14:38.094
you were a patron at an
establishment called

14:38.138 --> 14:41.924
Downbound Lounge on November
11th-- is that correct?

14:41.968 --> 14:43.404
Yes, sir.

14:43.447 --> 14:44.535
ERIC: Did you
consume alcohol

14:44.579 --> 14:45.797
at this
establishment?

14:45.841 --> 14:47.190
Yes, sir, I did.

14:47.234 --> 14:49.497
About how many drinks
did you have?

14:49.540 --> 14:51.151
Two shots and one beer, sir.

14:51.194 --> 14:53.153
Were you
intoxicated?

14:53.196 --> 14:55.590
The breathalyzer
put me at .06, sir.

14:55.633 --> 14:56.939
ERIC: So you were
legally sober

14:56.983 --> 14:58.898
when you struck
the New Jersey police officer?

14:58.941 --> 15:01.552
I have no excuse
for my actions or...

15:01.596 --> 15:03.946
ERIC: We're not looking for
an excuse at this point.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.035
Just a reason.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.434
LEE:
Very well.

15:13.477 --> 15:14.957
I'm gonna recommend
that your case be moved

15:15.001 --> 15:17.264
forward to an Executive
Officer's Inquiry.

15:17.307 --> 15:18.787
You're dismissed.

15:18.830 --> 15:21.442
Yes, sir.

15:28.492 --> 15:32.279
[indistinct radio chatter]

15:32.322 --> 15:33.497
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
not too close there, okay?

15:33.541 --> 15:34.890
I don't want you
crop-dusting me

15:34.934 --> 15:36.239
while I'm getting
my beauty sleep.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.675
VIC: I can't make
any promises.

15:37.719 --> 15:41.288
Just keep it tight there,
Vickey Mouse.

15:41.331 --> 15:44.247
Careful, this could be
some big, uh,

15:44.291 --> 15:46.554
elaborate payback for you
failing as a wingman.

15:46.597 --> 15:48.643
[laughs]
You know he did his best, but,

15:48.686 --> 15:51.298
uh, what he does need is to be
tutored by the froggiest frogman

15:51.341 --> 15:52.690
that ever frogged.

15:52.734 --> 15:53.953
Ain't that right?

15:53.996 --> 15:55.084
Well, I'm happy to help.

15:55.128 --> 15:56.694
I'm not talking
about you, Clay.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.696
"Clay"?

15:58.740 --> 16:01.264
Yeah.
Not Nick Carter,

16:01.308 --> 16:02.483
blonde Backstreet Boy?
No.

16:02.526 --> 16:04.920
No, sorry.
See, Obi-Wan, he-he knew

16:04.964 --> 16:07.618
when he lost
to the dark side, so...

16:07.662 --> 16:10.665
what I'm gonna do
is focus on Padawan Vic here.

16:10.708 --> 16:13.624
And teach him the wisdom
of someone that wants to,

16:13.668 --> 16:16.149
uh, be fully committed
to the Jedi lifestyle.

16:16.192 --> 16:19.152
You're comparing
Rebecca to Darth Vader?

16:19.195 --> 16:21.632
Nah, I mean, the way
you popped off in Liberia,

16:21.676 --> 16:23.852
I don't think you ever would've
done that before you met her.

16:23.895 --> 16:26.159
Hmm? She's got
your head turned, boy.

16:26.202 --> 16:27.638
Did you forget about
all the other times

16:27.682 --> 16:29.031
I popped off
before I met her?

16:29.075 --> 16:30.250
I'm just...

16:30.293 --> 16:31.816
saying what is.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.557
Hmm.
Okay?

16:33.601 --> 16:35.342
I just need to know

16:35.385 --> 16:36.604
the guy next to me, he's got

16:36.647 --> 16:37.605
his head in the game,
that's all.

16:38.910 --> 16:41.130
JASON:
All right, gather up.

16:41.174 --> 16:42.262
Let's go, wake up.

16:42.305 --> 16:44.046

16:44.090 --> 16:46.396

16:46.440 --> 16:48.442
Hit Full Metal, will you?

16:51.793 --> 16:53.534
So, I just got off
the phone with Blackburn.

16:53.577 --> 16:55.362
It appears that Davis
went through some

16:55.405 --> 16:57.625
disciplinary review--
it's not looking so good.

16:57.668 --> 16:59.018
Next step is
Executive Officer Inquiry.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.715
RAY: What?Yeah.

17:00.758 --> 17:02.586
Why?She got clipped
a couple weeks ago.

17:02.630 --> 17:04.023
Public intoxication,

17:04.066 --> 17:05.676
assaulting
a police officer.CLAY: Davis?

17:05.720 --> 17:08.070
Yeah.
No, there's no way.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.680
Well, I figure her last call
was to you, Sonny.

17:09.724 --> 17:12.727
So, you want
to fill in the gaps?

17:12.770 --> 17:14.598
Oh, well, this is
the first I'm hearing of it,

17:14.642 --> 17:16.557
but if you ask me, you know,

17:16.600 --> 17:18.646
that officer was
probably asking for it.

17:18.689 --> 17:22.128
What the hell I don't understand
is why-why Blackburn didn't

17:22.171 --> 17:23.999
speak up in her defense,
and put an end to it?

17:24.043 --> 17:26.262
Well, he was probably
blindsided by the whole thing

17:26.306 --> 17:27.611
just like we are.

17:27.655 --> 17:28.960
It's got to put him
in a tough spot

17:29.004 --> 17:30.962
politically with Command,
so it's gonna be

17:31.006 --> 17:32.790
on us to step up for her
since he can't.

17:32.834 --> 17:33.791
When's her XOI?

17:33.835 --> 17:34.923
Day after tomorrow.

17:36.533 --> 17:38.405
Well, some long flights,

17:38.448 --> 17:41.625
don't know how hard it's
gonna be to grab Kostarov and...

17:41.669 --> 17:43.975
it's a tight timeline
to get back there for her.

17:44.019 --> 17:45.803
If she doesn't beat this,
she will get bounced

17:45.847 --> 17:47.327
out of Command,
that's for damn sure.

17:47.370 --> 17:48.763
JASON: That's why we
got to crush this op,

17:48.806 --> 17:50.982
focus up, and get home quick,
all right?

17:51.026 --> 17:53.115
So, after we breach,
we split the train.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.030
Sonny, you got
Vic and Brock.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.727
Basement and first deck.

17:56.771 --> 17:58.642
The rest with me,

18:56.222 --> 18:59.138
Her job change having an impact
on your guys' relationship.

18:59.181 --> 19:00.313
Sonny, it's Davis.

19:00.356 --> 19:03.054
That's all in the past now.

19:08.582 --> 19:10.149
RAY:
3, this is 2.

19:10.192 --> 19:11.498
First room is clear.

19:11.541 --> 19:14.153
Make entry and stash
the breaching tools.

19:14.196 --> 19:16.590
We can talk about it
another day, but right now,

19:16.633 --> 19:18.244
I need to know the guy
standing next to me

19:18.287 --> 19:20.202
has his head in the game.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.204
Laser focused.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.119
Just like you, princess.

19:25.599 --> 19:28.167
Let's go.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.212
JASON:
Bravo 3, this is 1.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.258
Take 5 and 7 to clear
the basement of the warehouse.

19:32.301 --> 19:35.435
The rest of us are gonna
hit the upper decks.

19:35.478 --> 19:37.480
Strong copy.

19:37.524 --> 19:39.090
Go, go.

19:40.875 --> 19:44.183
[music playing faintly]

19:44.226 --> 19:47.186
[men speaking indistinctly
in distance]

20:02.288 --> 20:03.680
[whirring nearby]

20:06.727 --> 20:08.163
[whirring stops]

20:10.731 --> 20:13.299
[men speaking indistinctly
in distance]

20:29.706 --> 20:32.579
[men speaking indistinctly
in distance]

20:32.622 --> 20:34.363
[man shouts][gunfire]

20:37.671 --> 20:39.281
[men shouting]

20:39.325 --> 20:41.805
I count three!

20:44.547 --> 20:45.679
Make that two!

20:47.681 --> 20:49.291
Grenade!

20:50.640 --> 20:52.076
Avalanche!

21:00.694 --> 21:01.738
RAY: The hell was that?[coughing]

21:01.782 --> 21:03.087
JASON:
Everyone good?

21:03.131 --> 21:05.264
Yeah, roger that, boss.

21:07.178 --> 21:09.006
Bravo 3, this is 1.
Radio check.

21:09.050 --> 21:11.008
[groaning, coughing]

21:11.052 --> 21:12.401
Bravo 3, this is 1.
Radio check.

21:16.231 --> 21:18.102
That's good. Copy.

21:18.146 --> 21:20.627
Read you, Lima Charlie.

21:20.670 --> 21:23.020
What the hell happened
down there?

21:25.066 --> 21:27.808
Looks like a frag went off
in the basement,

21:27.851 --> 21:30.114
setting off
a sympathetic detonation.

21:31.202 --> 21:33.030
Aw, man.

21:33.074 --> 21:35.032
What the hell's down there?

21:35.076 --> 21:37.426
Well, might as well
have been a wildfire,

21:37.470 --> 21:38.993
'cause the floors from above
are collapsed

21:39.036 --> 21:40.386
all the way down
to the basement,

21:40.429 --> 21:41.952
blocking the stairwell.

21:41.996 --> 21:42.997
Need help getting out?

21:43.040 --> 21:45.347
Uh, that is a negative.

21:45.391 --> 21:46.870
We'll work the problem.

21:46.914 --> 21:48.350
Copy that.

21:48.394 --> 21:51.135
Bravo 1, ISR just registered
a heat signature

21:51.179 --> 21:54.138
of what looks like a large
explosion on target. How copy?

21:54.182 --> 21:55.357
JASON:
Yeah, we got heavy ordnance

21:55.401 --> 21:56.880
that detonated in the basement.

21:56.924 --> 21:59.274
No casualties. Charlie Mike.Roger that.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.624
Do you need assistance
from our partner forces?

22:01.668 --> 22:04.366
Have them make sure that
the front entrance is clear.

22:04.410 --> 22:07.151
Explosion probably
woke up the neighborhood.Roger. We're on it.

22:07.195 --> 22:08.762
Havoc out.

22:08.805 --> 22:10.677
All right,
get Bangladesh Counterterrorism

22:10.720 --> 22:13.070
and Transnational Crime
on the horn and pass the word.

22:13.114 --> 22:14.550
SONNY:
All right, boys,
quickie saw's upstairs.

22:14.594 --> 22:15.986
We got to sledge
our way out of here.

22:16.030 --> 22:17.771
Unless y'all got,
uh, any better ideas.

22:17.814 --> 22:19.773
Well, you got
breaching charges, right?

22:19.816 --> 22:21.514
Can we blast it,
give us a head start?

22:21.557 --> 22:23.733
That is such a sweet thought
there, Vickey Spears,

22:23.777 --> 22:26.345
but unless you want to bleed
out of your eyeballs

22:26.388 --> 22:28.912
from the overpressure,
I'd start swinging.

22:28.956 --> 22:31.175
[pounding on wall]Yep, it is...

22:31.219 --> 22:33.482
sledge-o-matic time.

22:41.795 --> 22:42.970
Whoa.

22:43.013 --> 22:44.188
Bangladesh--
what's going on?

22:44.232 --> 22:45.755
On my way to brief Lindell.

22:45.799 --> 22:47.148
Some ordnance
detonated on target.

22:47.191 --> 22:49.106
But the intel said
that they're a safe house.

22:49.150 --> 22:50.717
Nothing about a weapons cache.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.980
They okay?No injuries.
Definitely a setback.

22:53.023 --> 22:55.199
They can take care of
themselves, unlike you.

22:55.243 --> 22:57.114
What?

22:58.812 --> 23:00.466
You do know that you can
speak in your own defense

23:00.509 --> 23:01.771
at the DRB, right?

23:01.815 --> 23:04.208
I just thought that I...

23:04.252 --> 23:06.602
I thought
I should stay humble.

23:06.646 --> 23:09.083
That wasn't humility.
That was surrender.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.435
What the hell happened
that night, Lisa?

23:14.480 --> 23:16.177
Some guys were hitting on me.

23:16.220 --> 23:17.831
I hit back.

23:17.874 --> 23:20.224
Cop was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

23:20.268 --> 23:21.878
Then why didn't you just
say that? Better yet,

23:21.922 --> 23:23.706
why didn't you use your
one phone call on me?

23:23.750 --> 23:25.404
I could've helped you
get ahead of this.

23:25.447 --> 23:27.275
The fact that you
didn't inform anyone

23:27.318 --> 23:28.885
makes the entire
chain of command doubt

23:28.929 --> 23:31.322
whether you're honest
and trustworthy.

23:31.366 --> 23:34.151
If you can't prove
that you're both to the XO,

23:34.195 --> 23:36.850
you're headed
for captain's mast.

23:46.163 --> 23:48.514
[man groaning weakly]

23:48.557 --> 23:50.603
Trent, Metal.

23:50.646 --> 23:52.866
Clear the rest of the building.
We got this.

23:57.131 --> 23:58.524
That's Kostarov.

23:59.916 --> 24:01.483
He's bad, boss.

24:01.527 --> 24:04.138
We got to get him to
secondary care fast, J.

24:04.181 --> 24:05.139
He's losing too much blood
and that QuikClot's

24:05.182 --> 24:06.227
not gonna stop it.

24:06.270 --> 24:07.446
We need all the information

24:07.489 --> 24:08.621
we can out of that guy's head.

24:08.664 --> 24:10.449
If he dies,
mission failure.

24:10.492 --> 24:12.276
[gasps, breathing stops]

24:14.888 --> 24:16.455
He's gone.

24:16.498 --> 24:17.543
Damn it.

24:17.586 --> 24:19.414
Grab biometrics.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.198
Havoc, this is 1.

24:21.242 --> 24:22.678
ERIC:
Go for Havoc.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.160
Scratch my last.
Bravo 1 out.

24:26.203 --> 24:27.248
Roger that, 1.

24:27.291 --> 24:29.206
Got ethernet cables.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.340
Yeah. Looks like they
go up to the third floor.

24:32.383 --> 24:34.211
Maybe Kostarov has a computer.

24:34.255 --> 24:36.823
Well, let's go see what's
on the other end of them.

24:36.866 --> 24:38.215
Bravo 3, sitrep?

24:38.259 --> 24:39.565
SONNY:
Still working the problem, boss.

24:39.608 --> 24:40.827
Almost through.Copy that.

24:40.870 --> 24:42.350
J, we don't
have time

24:42.393 --> 24:43.960
to treasure hunt through
a third world unstable building.

24:44.004 --> 24:45.484
I want to salvage
this op and get

24:45.527 --> 24:47.181
the intel that we need.If the priority's
getting back

24:47.224 --> 24:49.618
to Davis, shouldn't we just bust
the boys out and head home?

24:49.662 --> 24:51.402
Building's all clear.

24:51.446 --> 24:54.318
Okay. Let's roll.
We'll cruise to this SSE.

24:54.362 --> 24:56.320
Pilot'll make up
time in the air.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.678
[pounding in distance]

25:11.814 --> 25:13.947
Gonna need another way up.

25:15.209 --> 25:16.950
This is pretty direct.

25:16.993 --> 25:19.822
[pounding continues in distance]

25:21.824 --> 25:23.217
Vic.

25:23.260 --> 25:24.914
One more good hit right there.

25:31.225 --> 25:33.183
Aw, come on, now.

25:35.316 --> 25:37.100
That is not good.

25:37.144 --> 25:38.493
Not good at all.

25:38.537 --> 25:39.929
[coughing]

25:44.455 --> 25:46.414
[all coughing]

25:51.332 --> 25:54.770
The smoke is getting thick.[coughing]

25:54.814 --> 25:56.293
We need to get this
under control,

25:56.337 --> 25:59.558
and when we do, we will de-jock
and conserve our oxygen.

25:59.601 --> 26:01.342
Aw, the heat's melting
the plastic.

26:01.385 --> 26:02.952
[coughs]

26:02.996 --> 26:05.128
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 3.

26:05.172 --> 26:06.869
[coughs]
We got a problem.

26:06.913 --> 26:09.263
I need some help
down here, buddy.

26:09.306 --> 26:11.265
Bravo 3, say your last.

26:11.308 --> 26:13.397
We got smoke coming
through the hole in the wall.

26:13.441 --> 26:14.964
We can't seem to stop it,
and it's getting

26:15.008 --> 26:17.140
really hard to breathe.
[coughs]

26:17.184 --> 26:18.838
Okay. Bravo 3, stand by.

26:18.881 --> 26:20.840
Full Metal,
grab the breaching tools,

26:20.883 --> 26:22.363
help the boys.Roger that.

26:22.406 --> 26:23.582
Clay, you're with me.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.018
Let's go find
some kind of a jackpot.

26:25.061 --> 26:26.323
Yeah.

26:28.543 --> 26:30.240
So what's going on with
you and Sonny, huh?

26:30.284 --> 26:32.591
You been fighting all the time.
In the bar, in the plane.

26:32.634 --> 26:35.158
What's the problem?Uh, he's got a problem
with Rebecca.

26:35.202 --> 26:37.247
Problem with
you or her?

26:37.291 --> 26:38.640
Here they are.

26:38.684 --> 26:40.642
I don't know, maybe both.
He's still reeling

26:40.686 --> 26:42.862
from his chick
freakin' torpedoing him.

26:42.905 --> 26:45.168
You second-guessing
bringing her around us?

26:45.212 --> 26:47.388
Nah. Sonny'll get over it.

26:47.431 --> 26:48.911
You know, Bravo's
the biggest part of my life,

26:48.955 --> 26:50.957
figure Rebecca needs to
be a part of it, too.

26:52.828 --> 26:54.090
Jackpot.

26:56.049 --> 26:57.703
Nothing.
There's no hard drives.

26:57.746 --> 26:59.530
If he's here,
hard drives are here.

26:59.574 --> 27:00.880
Tear it up.

27:03.317 --> 27:05.885
I would rather drown
in a torpedo tube

27:05.928 --> 27:08.017
than be cremated
in this stairwell.

27:08.061 --> 27:09.540
Tell you what,

27:09.584 --> 27:10.977
I hate fire

27:11.020 --> 27:12.326
and I hate smoke!

27:12.369 --> 27:14.284
We're coming to
you, Bravo, 3.

27:14.328 --> 27:16.591
Still on our way down
to the quickie saw.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.727
Dead end.

27:22.597 --> 27:24.947
Ray.

27:24.991 --> 27:28.081
Weak spot. Shouldn't take
too much to break through here.Yeah?

27:28.124 --> 27:29.952
Good idea. Let's do it.

27:34.348 --> 27:36.393
Surprised to see you
back in the saddle, you know?

27:36.437 --> 27:38.352
After what happened with Stella.

27:38.395 --> 27:40.354
What-what other option
do I have?

27:40.397 --> 27:42.617
You know? I mean,
after my parents got divorced,

27:42.661 --> 27:45.620
the only thing my dad committed
to was just being a lone wolf.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.448
I'm sure it was a lot of
fun when he was younger,

27:47.491 --> 27:49.450
but now he's just alone.Having a new girl,

27:49.493 --> 27:51.408
no guarantee you're
not gonna end up alone.

27:51.452 --> 27:53.715
You have the same job...

27:53.759 --> 27:56.239
she's gonna have
the same issues.

27:56.283 --> 27:58.154
Yeah, but you can't
look at it like that.No?

27:58.198 --> 28:00.461
No, I mean, you just got to
ignore and override, you know?

28:00.504 --> 28:01.984
It's like overcoming
an injury, right?

28:02.028 --> 28:03.986
You just put the old
relationship behind you,

28:04.030 --> 28:05.640
and you just hope
for the best.

28:09.165 --> 28:11.080
Hey, what's this?

28:11.124 --> 28:12.691
Look at that.

28:12.734 --> 28:14.344
What do you got?

28:14.388 --> 28:15.955
Got a safe.

28:17.391 --> 28:20.089
Nice. I need the quickie saw
to open this thing, though.

28:20.133 --> 28:21.569
Ray needs it for the boys.

28:21.612 --> 28:23.832
How about a single torch?No, Trent's carrying it.

28:23.876 --> 28:26.008
Looks like this baby's
coming with us.

28:29.795 --> 28:31.274
Grab the sledge.

28:48.117 --> 28:50.293
Damn it.

28:50.337 --> 28:52.165
Well...

28:52.208 --> 28:54.210
it wasa good idea.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.387
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 2.

28:57.431 --> 28:59.738
We have a pretty good fire
cooking down here.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.174
Got to be a lot of smoke
in the air.

29:01.217 --> 29:03.089
Can we determine
an emergency services ETA

29:03.132 --> 29:04.090
using the ISR feed?

29:04.133 --> 29:05.961
Sir, this column
of vehicles

29:06.005 --> 29:08.137
seems to be emergency
services trucks,

29:08.181 --> 29:10.400
but they're not running their
lights, so I can't be sure.

29:10.444 --> 29:12.707
I'm attempting to contact
them now to confirm.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.405
RAY:
Havoc Base, this is Bravo 2.
Radio check. Over.

29:15.449 --> 29:18.452
That's a good check, Bravo 2.
Stand by.

29:18.495 --> 29:20.889
We're working on it.Roger that.
Standing by.

29:20.933 --> 29:22.891
Tostand by, apparently.

29:22.935 --> 29:25.676
Yeah. Be nice
if they had a fire

29:25.720 --> 29:27.330
up under their ass
in Virginia beach.

29:33.946 --> 29:37.732
[coughing]

29:37.776 --> 29:39.516
How long does it take
to get an answer?

29:40.561 --> 29:42.476
Longer than our boys have.

29:42.519 --> 29:45.609
We got to put that
fire out ourselves.With what?

29:45.653 --> 29:48.090
We can't smother it,
so we got to starve it.

29:48.134 --> 29:50.527
How many slap charges
you got on you?

29:50.571 --> 29:52.094
I got one.Two on me.

29:52.138 --> 29:53.792
Pull 'em.

29:53.835 --> 29:56.142
Bravo 1, this
is Bravo 2.

29:56.185 --> 29:58.840
We're gonna do some internal
explosive breaching down here.

29:58.884 --> 30:00.276
Roger that.
Building's not gonna be able

30:00.320 --> 30:01.974
to take much more stress.
Any other options?

30:02.017 --> 30:05.368
[coughs] Whatever gets us out
of here fastest, boss.

30:05.412 --> 30:06.587
We're running out of time.

30:06.630 --> 30:08.023
Copy that. Bravo 2, send it.

30:09.111 --> 30:10.939
Well, here we go, boys.

30:10.983 --> 30:12.767
Metal, toss it in.

30:17.859 --> 30:19.034
Good?Yeah.

30:20.035 --> 30:21.820
Fire in the hole!

30:23.865 --> 30:25.345
[coughing]

30:30.829 --> 30:33.570
Okay, this'll get us back
to the main room.

30:33.614 --> 30:35.616
Let's rig a way down.

30:36.878 --> 30:38.749
Trent,
grab the fire extinguisher.

30:38.793 --> 30:40.839
Metal, get the saw.

30:42.666 --> 30:44.451
[grunts]
Damn it.

30:46.670 --> 30:48.977
All right, Trent, when
you're done with that,

30:49.021 --> 30:50.805
I got a present for you.

30:53.634 --> 30:54.853
We should be able to get to them
through here.

30:54.896 --> 30:56.898
Hit it.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.301
Fire that up, Metal.

31:08.344 --> 31:10.346
[quickie saw whirring loudly]

31:24.186 --> 31:26.188
[whirring continues in distance]

31:32.891 --> 31:33.892
I'm through.

31:38.592 --> 31:39.854
Sonny, you okay?

31:41.987 --> 31:43.989
Sonny, you guys okay?

31:45.904 --> 31:47.949
Come on.
Come on.

31:47.993 --> 31:50.517
Cerberus, come
here. Cerberus!

31:50.560 --> 31:52.258
All right, I got him.

31:52.301 --> 31:55.043
I got him, I got him, I got him.All right, all right.

31:55.087 --> 31:56.566
Here, Cerberus.
Come on.

31:56.610 --> 31:58.786
Sonny? Sonny?[coughing]

31:58.829 --> 32:01.397
Vic. Brock.

32:01.441 --> 32:03.095
Sonny!

32:03.138 --> 32:05.053
[coughing]

32:06.663 --> 32:09.231
[grunts softly]

32:16.021 --> 32:18.023
[grunting]

32:25.944 --> 32:27.946
It, uh, sure'd be nice
if I wasn't the guy

32:27.989 --> 32:29.686
that always needed bailing out.[whistles]

32:29.730 --> 32:30.861
Just once.Don't...

32:30.905 --> 32:32.385
Don't think of it
like that, buddy.

32:32.428 --> 32:34.300
We only cared
about saving the dog.

32:34.343 --> 32:36.302
We didn't even know
you were in that room.

32:36.345 --> 32:38.478
[laughs]

32:38.521 --> 32:41.742
[groans softly, sighs]

32:41.785 --> 32:44.310
So, just talked to the pilot.

32:44.353 --> 32:46.051
He's hauling ass.

32:46.094 --> 32:47.878
Looks like we might actually
pull this off, brother.

32:47.922 --> 32:50.011
Yeah. Jeez.VIC:
Hard drives are in the safe.

32:50.055 --> 32:52.927
Snatching victory
from defeat. Nice.

32:52.971 --> 32:56.017
Yeah. Well, no time
to spike the football just yet.

32:56.061 --> 32:59.064
Got a teammate back home
we got to get to and save.

32:59.107 --> 33:00.413
Isn't that right, Ray?

33:00.456 --> 33:02.023
Damn straight.

33:02.067 --> 33:04.025
Yes, it was a mistake

33:04.069 --> 33:05.940
not to tell Command
about the incident.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.290
I believe
I have learned my lesson.

33:08.334 --> 33:11.163
I understand that my behavior
outside of work reflects

33:11.206 --> 33:13.252
on my character
as a naval officer.

33:17.996 --> 33:21.434
Is there anything else that
Command should learn from me

33:21.477 --> 33:23.088
rather than an outside source?

33:25.003 --> 33:28.049
I was in a relationship
with a member of my unit.

33:28.093 --> 33:31.618
We took great pains to keep it a
secret because we were in love,

33:31.661 --> 33:35.274
but it was a violation
of the fraternization rules.

33:44.109 --> 33:45.371
JASON:
Let's go.

33:45.414 --> 33:48.026
XOI in ten minutes. Let's move.
Sonny, come on.

33:48.069 --> 33:49.070
MACK:
Gentlemen.

33:49.114 --> 33:50.376
Master Chief.

33:50.419 --> 33:52.117
What's up, Mack?

33:53.118 --> 33:55.076
Slap charges, huh?

33:55.120 --> 33:57.470
Outside of the box
problem-solving.

33:57.513 --> 34:00.081
Earns a lot fans
during a warrant officer review.

34:00.125 --> 34:01.604
Yeah.We should talk real quick.

34:01.648 --> 34:03.215
Oh, I really
appreciate you, Mack,

34:03.258 --> 34:05.478
but I'm kind of in
a rush right now.

34:05.521 --> 34:08.307
I know. You're gonna go stand in
for Davis, right?

34:08.350 --> 34:10.700
Yeah.

34:10.744 --> 34:12.876
Look, it's just
as easy to lose fans

34:12.920 --> 34:14.356
as it is to win 'em, Ray.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.880
You give your word on Davis,
and she goes down--

34:16.924 --> 34:18.273
it's bad optics, man.

34:18.317 --> 34:21.537
Worse than not standing up
for a teammate?

34:21.581 --> 34:23.800
Her character's
being questioned.

34:23.844 --> 34:26.020
If you're absolutely certain

34:26.064 --> 34:27.761
she can beat this thing,
then fine, but

34:27.804 --> 34:30.503
for the sake of your career, for
the people that depend on it...

34:30.546 --> 34:32.983
[keypad beeping]you can't be
on the wrong side of this.

34:33.027 --> 34:34.507
[door opens]

34:34.550 --> 34:36.117
Ray, let's go.

34:36.161 --> 34:38.163
Yeah.

34:41.340 --> 34:43.820
[door opens]

34:43.864 --> 34:46.040
Ensign Davis, we're ready.

34:51.872 --> 34:53.830
We're here to speak
to the commander.

34:53.874 --> 34:55.963
It's not exactly
protocol.

34:56.006 --> 34:57.834
Duly noted. My team
still wants a say.

35:07.017 --> 35:09.063
Coming?

35:12.675 --> 35:14.851
All right.

35:19.726 --> 35:22.468
[door closes]Sir, we're aware that
Ensign Davis messed up.

35:22.511 --> 35:25.166
She made a mistake
off the clock,

35:25.210 --> 35:27.125
far away from
the battlefield.

35:27.168 --> 35:30.258
When I take my team outside
of the wire, she is

35:30.302 --> 35:32.826
the best intel officer
at the command, sir.

35:32.869 --> 35:36.134
CLAY:
She's as important
as any shooter on our team.

35:36.177 --> 35:39.311
I trust her with my life.
With all of our lives.

35:40.964 --> 35:43.619
SONNY:
You're running her up
because you think that she

35:43.663 --> 35:45.317
used bad judgment.

35:45.360 --> 35:48.450
That's just
ass-backwards, sir.

35:48.494 --> 35:52.367
Ensign Davis' entire life has
been a series of tough calls.

35:53.934 --> 35:55.892
Well, she ain't ever
made a bad one.

35:55.936 --> 35:58.460
She always puts the Navy first.

35:58.504 --> 35:59.983
Always.

36:00.027 --> 36:01.724
Ahead of herself

36:01.768 --> 36:03.161
and ahead of her own happiness.

36:03.204 --> 36:05.163
I'll tell you what,

36:05.206 --> 36:07.295
if that ain't
character, then

36:07.339 --> 36:09.341
I don't know what is.

36:10.994 --> 36:12.996
Sir.

36:14.607 --> 36:18.045
Ensign Davis appears lucky
to have Bravo Team on her side.

36:18.088 --> 36:20.134
We're lucky to have
her as one of us.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.354
Thank you for letting
us talk, sir.

36:29.143 --> 36:31.101
You didn't have to do that.

36:31.145 --> 36:32.320
You're one of us.

36:32.364 --> 36:34.670
Family.

36:34.714 --> 36:36.716
Always got your back.

36:39.022 --> 36:41.024
[door closes]

36:45.377 --> 36:46.987
Do you need a moment, Ensign?

36:47.030 --> 36:50.077
No, sir.
I'm ready.

36:50.120 --> 36:52.166
All right, here we go.
Raise 'em up.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.777
Here's to Ensign Davis
for beating the rap, huh?

36:54.821 --> 36:56.562
Davis!She beat the rap, right?

36:56.605 --> 36:58.390
Captain's mast is gonna have
to wait a while

36:58.433 --> 37:00.261
to claim one of Bravo's own.DAVIS:
Oh, God.

37:00.305 --> 37:03.873
Well, thank you. Thank you
all so much. I... I mean it.

37:03.917 --> 37:06.572
It's really good to be
reminded I'm a part of a pack.

37:06.615 --> 37:08.922
I really do wish you would
let me pay for tonight,

37:08.965 --> 37:10.793
since I can't even drink, so...

37:10.837 --> 37:13.274
Yeah, not a chance. Not while
your pay's been docked.

37:13.318 --> 37:14.928
Skoal.DAVIS:
Thank you, boss.

37:14.971 --> 37:16.973
Guys. Yeah.

37:18.105 --> 37:21.151
Hey.Hey.

37:22.631 --> 37:24.807
I, uh... I'm sorry
I wasn't there.

37:26.113 --> 37:27.549
Hey, look, you had
a hard call to make.

37:27.593 --> 37:29.159
Believe me, I get it.

37:31.205 --> 37:33.207
Think it was the right one?

37:34.817 --> 37:36.863
Not for me to say, Ray.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.259
Yeah.

37:44.131 --> 37:46.960
Tough... but fair.

37:47.003 --> 37:49.354
Hey, thank you for what
you said in there.

37:49.397 --> 37:51.921
Hmm. Yeah.

37:51.965 --> 37:55.098
Well... I meant every word.

38:05.544 --> 38:07.372
RAY:
Should have went in there
with you guys.

38:07.415 --> 38:09.504
Stop beating yourself up,
all right?

38:09.548 --> 38:11.898
You know, you did
what was best for your family.

38:11.941 --> 38:14.640
Davis-- she was saved,
so, you know, it's a win-win.

38:14.683 --> 38:17.077
Yeah, I know I'm doing
what's best for my family.

38:17.120 --> 38:20.123
It's just... today doesn't
feel like victory, Jason.

38:20.167 --> 38:21.864
Are you listening
to yourself right now?

38:21.908 --> 38:23.257
Come on. Change is good.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.128
Adapt or die.
You know that.

38:27.130 --> 38:28.871
That's ironic
coming from you.

38:28.915 --> 38:31.309
How's that?
Why is that ironic?

38:31.352 --> 38:33.093
What, do you think
I can't change?

38:33.136 --> 38:35.313
Is that what you're saying?D... No, no.

38:35.356 --> 38:37.924
No.No, no. It's not a question
of ability, brother.

38:37.967 --> 38:40.883
It's... a question of
wanting to. [chuckles]

38:42.668 --> 38:45.061
SONNY:
Five, four, three, two...

38:45.105 --> 38:47.368
Oh, just in time, man.
Just in time.No, I got it. I got it.

38:47.412 --> 38:49.283
I got it.All right, all right,
what we got?

38:49.327 --> 38:51.938
All right, some live ones
over by the dartboard.

38:51.981 --> 38:53.940
SONNY:
Ooh-ee!

38:53.983 --> 38:55.289
Okay, let's see
what kind of moves

38:55.333 --> 38:56.725
you got there, Ricky Martin.

38:56.769 --> 38:58.248
Want to go play the no game?

38:58.292 --> 39:00.163
Yup.
Oh, yeah?
Okay, yeah.

39:00.207 --> 39:03.297
I don't remember Clay being
this wet behind the ears.Uh-uh. Tinkerbell

39:03.341 --> 39:06.039
was way worse, way worse.Where is he?

39:06.082 --> 39:08.520
No, no. It don't matter, okay?

39:08.563 --> 39:11.087
It's not like Leave it to Beaver
could help us anyway.

39:11.131 --> 39:13.481
Mm. Love awaits.

39:16.397 --> 39:19.052
I really
like your shirt.

39:27.016 --> 39:28.670
You clean up nice.

39:28.714 --> 39:32.239
I, uh... I figured I got
to amort these shoes.

39:35.938 --> 39:38.419
Thank you for making
the trek out here.

39:38.463 --> 39:40.247
What changed your mind?

39:40.290 --> 39:41.466
You.

39:43.424 --> 39:46.296
I, uh... I
wanted to explain

39:46.340 --> 39:47.776
I haven't been
honest with you.

39:47.820 --> 39:49.474
Oh, don't tell me
you're married.

39:49.517 --> 39:51.040
Or worse.

39:51.084 --> 39:53.869
Just regular Navy.[chuckles]

39:53.913 --> 39:56.219
I have imagined myself
on a bigger stage.

39:57.743 --> 39:59.919
Maybe there are better
ways to impact the world

39:59.962 --> 40:02.225
than carrying a rifle.

40:02.269 --> 40:04.445
Well, you're
in the right place.

40:04.489 --> 40:06.621
Here. Come on.

40:12.192 --> 40:13.715
[laughing]

40:13.759 --> 40:16.109
I need to worry about
Quinn's influence on Lopez?

40:16.152 --> 40:18.241
No, man.
Sonny just needed a new wingman.

40:18.285 --> 40:20.243
That bromance is gonna be over

40:20.287 --> 40:22.245
as soon as he realizes
Vic is the better prize.

40:22.289 --> 40:25.161
Sonny ever think about asking me
to wingman for him?

40:25.205 --> 40:26.511
Yeah, that's a good one, Eric.

40:26.554 --> 40:28.991
I'll be right back.Yeah.

40:33.126 --> 40:35.171
Hey. You came.

40:35.215 --> 40:37.347
Your text said it was important.

40:37.391 --> 40:38.871
Whoa. What...?

40:38.914 --> 40:41.134
It's just a flesh
wound. Listen, I...

40:41.177 --> 40:45.660
I know that we're just
having fun here, and that...

40:45.704 --> 40:48.620
you know, that you want
to keep things separate,

40:48.663 --> 40:51.274
and I completely
respect that,

40:51.318 --> 40:53.625
I honor that and-and
I fully understand that,

40:53.668 --> 40:55.888
but I don't know
if I could really do this

40:55.931 --> 40:57.150
unless we are all-in.

40:57.193 --> 40:59.369
And, look,
if you want

40:59.413 --> 41:02.242
to turn around right
now and walk away,

41:02.285 --> 41:04.897
you can do that, and I
respect that. Go ahead.

41:04.940 --> 41:06.289
Uh...

41:13.209 --> 41:16.256
Maybe that was
a little bit of an excuse.

41:17.605 --> 41:20.260
Preventative measure
against more scar tissue.

41:20.303 --> 41:22.305
We both have enough.

41:24.307 --> 41:27.049
All-in...

41:27.093 --> 41:29.051
has strings.

41:29.095 --> 41:32.925
Strings-- they get messy, and...

41:37.799 --> 41:40.106
I got a messy life.

41:40.149 --> 41:42.630
Lot of strings.

41:42.674 --> 41:44.676
I just want
to make sure

41:44.719 --> 41:47.069
that you understand
what I'm saying here.

41:50.333 --> 41:52.466
I'm sure.

41:54.642 --> 41:56.862
Messy can be fun.

41:56.905 --> 42:00.213
Yeah, well, I don't know about
how much fun it can be, but...

42:00.256 --> 42:01.823
[both chuckle]
