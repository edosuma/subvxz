00:03.628 --> 00:06.339
<i>Previously on Your Honor...</i>

00:06.339 --> 00:09.926
<i>So your miraculous escape,
not so miraculous after all.</i>

00:09.926 --> 00:13.013
<i>And then Little Mo hides you
out in Houston with my sister,</i>

00:13.013 --> 00:14.472
<i>of all people, 'cause he knew</i>

00:14.472 --> 00:16.016
<i>I wouldn't go there
looking for you.</i>

00:16.016 --> 00:17.976
<i>You should have never
came back, Little Man.</i>

00:17.976 --> 00:20.020
<i>She was gonna kill you
if you took the money.</i>

00:20.020 --> 00:21.730
<i>You're lucky you're blood.</i>

00:21.730 --> 00:23.648
<i>You ain't fam.</i>

00:23.648 --> 00:25.358
<i>Not to me.</i>

00:25.358 --> 00:27.402
<i>Not no more.</i>

00:28.361 --> 00:30.030
<i>There's nothing
for me here anymore.</i>

00:30.030 --> 00:33.867
<i>Tomorrow, your ass is
on a bus back to H-Town.</i>

00:33.867 --> 00:35.368
<i>Fentanyl cut with heroin.</i>

00:35.368 --> 00:36.703
<i>You tried that shit?</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:38.371
<i>It's gonna be
the hottest shit in NOLA.</i>

00:38.371 --> 00:40.206
<i>You're my guinea pig, Joey.</i>

00:40.206 --> 00:43.001
<i>We were just talking about
the waterfront deal.</i>

00:43.001 --> 00:45.003
If this mayor is a problem,

00:45.003 --> 00:46.880
<i>there are ways to get a new one.</i>

00:46.880 --> 00:49.507
<i>I'm concerned
for Charlie's safety.</i>

00:49.507 --> 00:51.426
<i>If I can't do this deal
the way I wanted to,</i>

00:51.426 --> 00:53.053
<i>then other people are
gonna get involved.</i>

00:53.053 --> 00:56.556
<i>I am part of
a federal investigation</i>

00:56.556 --> 00:58.808
<i>into the Baxter organization.</i>

00:58.808 --> 01:00.894
<i>And you're just letting me in
on this now?</i>

01:00.894 --> 01:02.353
<i>I was trying to protect you.</i>

01:02.353 --> 01:04.022
<i>I can't make this deal.</i>

01:04.022 --> 01:05.732
<i>Not without some changes.</i>

01:05.732 --> 01:08.318
<i>The deal is done.
- What if she fails?</i>

01:08.318 --> 01:10.153
<i>She'll either bring down
the Baxters</i>

01:10.153 --> 01:12.405
<i>or the Baxters will build up
the waterfront.</i>

01:12.405 --> 01:15.867
<i>I need you to bury
his confession.</i>

01:15.867 --> 01:17.410
<i>What the hell's the point
of solving crimes</i>

01:17.410 --> 01:18.828
<i>if we're just gonna let
the criminals walk free?</i>

01:18.828 --> 01:21.247
<i>You may be free now...</i>

01:21.247 --> 01:22.874
<i>but that's not gonna
last forever.</i>

01:22.874 --> 01:24.918
<i>And when your
guardian angel vanishes,</i>

01:24.918 --> 01:28.088
<i>I'm gonna be
the next thing you see.</i>

01:30.507 --> 01:32.092
<i>Where were you...</i>

01:32.092 --> 01:34.636
<i>on the night of
your wife's murder?</i>

01:34.636 --> 01:37.639
<i>tense, suspenseful music</i>

01:55.698 --> 01:59.119
<i>October 10, the morning
after your wife was murdered,</i>

01:59.119 --> 02:01.579
<i>you gave this statement
to the NOPD.</i>

02:14.259 --> 02:16.970
<i>"I came home after work,
around seven o'clock.</i>

02:16.970 --> 02:18.638
<i>We had dinner together
as a family.</i>

02:18.638 --> 02:21.141
<i>Robin left around 9:00 or 9:30.</i>

02:21.141 --> 02:23.977
<i>Adam and I were home all night."</i>

02:27.772 --> 02:30.108
<i>Why are you asking me
about this now?</i>

02:30.108 --> 02:32.152
<i>She cheated on you.</i>

02:33.278 --> 02:34.988
<i>That must have stung.</i>

02:34.988 --> 02:37.699
<i>We never really
cleared that up, did we?</i>

02:38.324 --> 02:42.954
<i>I find it strange, your
reluctance to be forthcoming.</i>

02:53.214 --> 02:55.300
<i>This is you.</i>

02:55.300 --> 02:58.344
<i>This is the man
Robin had an affair with.</i>

02:58.344 --> 02:59.888
<i>This is the night
she was murdered.</i>

03:01.055 --> 03:03.224
<i>You look pretty mad, Michael.</i>

03:04.225 --> 03:05.727
<i>You haven't booked me.</i>

03:07.645 --> 03:09.439
<i>Because you don't have enough,</i>

03:09.439 --> 03:13.067
<i>if any, evidence to charge me.</i>

03:14.068 --> 03:16.487
<i>And yet, you have the audacity</i>

03:16.487 --> 03:19.699
<i>to march me through
the station in handcuffs?</i>

03:20.700 --> 03:22.619
<i>Oops.
- Mm.</i>

03:22.619 --> 03:24.204
<i>You're a person
of interest, though.</i>

03:24.204 --> 03:26.206
<i>I find you interesting.</i>

03:26.206 --> 03:28.875
<i>You know what's interesting?</i>

03:28.875 --> 03:30.543
<i>It only took you two years</i>

03:30.543 --> 03:32.378
<i>to come up with
the jealous husband theory?</i>

03:32.378 --> 03:37.300
<i>My opinion of you has evolved
quite a bit since then.</i>

03:37.300 --> 03:41.054
<i>So, now you think I'm capable
of killing my wife?</i>

03:41.054 --> 03:44.474
<i>I have no idea
what you're capable of anymore.</i>

03:45.558 --> 03:49.062
<i>The only question
that I'm interested in...</i>

03:49.062 --> 03:51.064
<i>is did you kill her?</i>

03:51.064 --> 03:54.234
<i>slow, dramatic music</i>

04:20.635 --> 04:23.680
Fuck you.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.807
Goddamn it.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.935
<i>What trouble
have you gotten into now?</i>

04:29.519 --> 04:33.898
<i>I just picked your ass up
at a police station, Michael.</i>

04:33.898 --> 04:35.608
<i>I want some answers.</i>

04:35.608 --> 04:38.611
<i>I was brought in for suspicion
of killing Robin Desiato.</i>

04:40.738 --> 04:42.865
<i>Yeah, I played that one
through in my mind, too.</i>

04:42.865 --> 04:44.158
<i>Many times.</i>

04:45.994 --> 04:47.745
<i>And what was your conclusion?</i>

04:47.745 --> 04:50.456
<i>For a while,
I actually wanted it to be you.</i>

04:51.666 --> 04:53.084
<i>But you couldn't have
killed my daughter.</i>

04:53.084 --> 04:54.961
<i>It's just not who you are.</i>

04:56.546 --> 04:59.048
<i>It's been two years.
Why do they suspect you now?</i>

05:02.010 --> 05:05.972
<i>They found out that I wasn't
home the night she was killed.</i>

05:05.972 --> 05:08.641
<i>I went to confront the man
she was sleeping with.</i>

05:08.641 --> 05:09.976
<i>You knew who he was?</i>

05:10.977 --> 05:12.603
<i>I did.</i>

05:12.603 --> 05:15.732
<i>And he's come forward now?</i>

05:15.732 --> 05:16.941
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:16.941 --> 05:18.776
<i>Well...</i>

05:18.776 --> 05:21.612
<i>I guess we're gonna go
talk to him then.</i>

05:21.612 --> 05:24.615
<i>slow, intriguing music</i>

05:42.050 --> 05:44.093
<i>Little Mo's gone.</i>

05:45.887 --> 05:47.764
<i>Time for y'all to step
your shit up.</i>

05:49.223 --> 05:51.601
<i>Once we're free and clear
of that Roderick motherfucker,</i>

05:51.601 --> 05:54.062
<i>we'll have good product to move.</i>

05:55.396 --> 05:58.316
<i>But until then,
we gotta deal with this shit.</i>

05:59.275 --> 06:00.526
<i>Come on.</i>

06:08.159 --> 06:10.912
<i>This is 30 milligrams of heroin.</i>

06:11.954 --> 06:13.706
<i>Enough to kill a grown man.</i>

06:13.706 --> 06:16.876
<i>But only three milligrams of
fentanyl will do the same thing.</i>

06:18.461 --> 06:20.004
<i>Now, all this shit is
cut with fenty,</i>

06:20.004 --> 06:21.714
<i>and not by
no motherfuckin' chemist.</i>

06:21.714 --> 06:25.593
<i>Which means the wrong baggie,
the wrong hit, you done.</i>

06:25.593 --> 06:27.053
<i>We just got to figure out
a way to move this</i>

06:27.053 --> 06:28.679
<i>without dropping bodies.</i>

06:28.679 --> 06:30.014
<i>Shit, every bag is
Russian roulette.</i>

06:30.014 --> 06:31.724
That's the problem.

06:31.724 --> 06:34.227
<i>I need a solution.
- Cut that shit again.</i>

06:34.227 --> 06:37.730
<i>Baking soda,
powdered milk, whatever.</i>

06:37.730 --> 06:39.732
<i>The high will be
weak as fuck, but...</i>

06:39.732 --> 06:41.401
<i>probably won't kill
nobody either.</i>

06:41.401 --> 06:42.902
<i>You did right
to pull it the first time.</i>

06:42.902 --> 06:45.071
<i>Bodies dropping is bad
for the neighborhood.</i>

06:45.071 --> 06:46.656
<i>That's why we're not
gonna sell it here.</i>

06:46.656 --> 06:49.242
<i>We send the corner boys
into the city.</i>

06:49.242 --> 06:50.993
<i>Spread it out.</i>

06:50.993 --> 06:54.872
<i>That way if anybody drops,
no one knows it's from here.</i>

06:54.872 --> 06:56.582
<i>And you cut
the motherfucker so thin</i>

06:56.582 --> 06:58.584
<i>that no bodies will drop.</i>

06:58.584 --> 06:59.919
<i>I got you.</i>

07:03.881 --> 07:06.259
<i>Top of the morning, Little Man.</i>

07:10.513 --> 07:12.765
<i>You make sure his ass
on that bus tonight.</i>

07:12.765 --> 07:15.768
<i>ominous music</i>

07:25.486 --> 07:30.408
<i>The mayor's stipulations
are going to be costly.</i>

07:30.408 --> 07:32.326
<i>So just in case,</i>

07:32.326 --> 07:36.706
<i>I got us a meeting with
some potential investors.</i>

07:36.706 --> 07:40.418
<i>Uh-huh?
What investors?</i>

07:40.418 --> 07:42.378
Old friends.

07:43.754 --> 07:47.300
<i>The Calabri Family
is interested.</i>

07:48.676 --> 07:49.927
<i>In what?</i>

07:49.927 --> 07:51.554
<i>A partnership.</i>

07:51.554 --> 07:53.639
<i>I don't want a partner.</i>

07:53.639 --> 07:55.641
<i>You want money, don't you?</i>

07:55.641 --> 07:58.811
<i>Come on, take the meeting.</i>

07:58.811 --> 08:00.646
<i>Let's hear their offer.</i>

08:01.606 --> 08:05.109
<i>contemplative music</i>

08:22.168 --> 08:24.170
<i>This is it?</i>

08:24.170 --> 08:25.671
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:35.306 --> 08:38.017
<i>Stay here if you want.
I'm gonna go get some answers.</i>

08:44.232 --> 08:45.858
<i>Kenneth.</i>

08:47.902 --> 08:49.445
<i>Michael.</i>

08:51.739 --> 08:54.367
<i>Elizabeth, by the way.</i>

08:54.367 --> 08:56.077
<i>I'm Robin's mother.</i>

09:20.768 --> 09:22.728
<i>Robin took this.</i>

09:23.646 --> 09:25.898
It was my favorite of hers.

09:28.276 --> 09:31.237
<i>I always thought her photos
elevated your articles.</i>

09:33.197 --> 09:35.116
<i>I agree with that.</i>

09:36.659 --> 09:38.327
<i>So, what do you want?</i>

09:38.327 --> 09:41.622
Why did you come forward now?

09:41.622 --> 09:43.374
Police came to me.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.875
<i>A couple days ago, they arrested</i>

09:44.875 --> 09:46.919
<i>some guy on grand theft auto.</i>

09:46.919 --> 09:49.714
<i>He wanted to exchange
information for a deal.</i>

09:49.714 --> 09:51.591
Who is he?

09:51.591 --> 09:55.177
<i>Former gang member who I used
as a source from time to time.</i>

09:55.177 --> 09:58.014
<i>Anyway, since I never
told the police</i>

09:58.014 --> 10:01.058
<i>about our relationship
and I gather you hadn't either,</i>

10:01.058 --> 10:03.269
<i>I guess this guy thought
they might want to know.</i>

10:03.269 --> 10:05.104
<i>Apparently, he was right</i>

10:05.104 --> 10:08.941
<i>'cause a Detective Costello
came to see me.</i>

10:08.941 --> 10:10.610
<i>And what did you tell her?</i>

10:10.610 --> 10:12.737
<i>That I was home all night.</i>

10:12.737 --> 10:15.281
<i>She asked me if anyone
could vouch for that.</i>

10:16.991 --> 10:18.909
<i>So I'm your alibi.</i>

10:18.909 --> 10:20.953
<i>And I'm yours.</i>

10:36.218 --> 10:39.180
<i>slow, dramatic music</i>

10:49.690 --> 10:51.484
<i>Can I...?</i>

10:51.484 --> 10:53.069
<i>Can I get a balloon?</i>

10:53.069 --> 10:54.779
<i>Man, we out.</i>

10:56.197 --> 10:57.490
<i>What do you mean you're out?</i>

10:57.490 --> 10:59.116
<i>Waiting on the drop.</i>

11:00.993 --> 11:03.245
<i>Come on, man, I got money.</i>

11:03.245 --> 11:04.997
<i>Get the fuck off me.</i>

11:07.249 --> 11:08.542
<i>This guy.</i>

11:17.051 --> 11:18.260
<i>Dad.</i>

11:18.260 --> 11:20.262
<i>Hey, Carlo.</i>

11:20.262 --> 11:22.014
<i>I've got a meeting right now.</i>

11:22.014 --> 11:24.016
<i>No, I know.
Uh, can I join?</i>

11:24.016 --> 11:25.851
<i>Better sit this one out.</i>

11:25.851 --> 11:28.145
<i>I won't say anything, Dad.
I just want to learn, you know?</i>

11:28.145 --> 11:29.855
<i>Next one, son.</i>

11:33.943 --> 11:37.071
<i>Gentlemen,
welcome to the Baxter House.</i>

11:37.071 --> 11:41.033
<i>Jimmy, this is Sal Calabri
and his son Phillip.</i>

11:41.033 --> 11:42.201
<i>Pleasure.</i>

11:42.201 --> 11:44.495
<i>My son-in-law Jimmy Baxter.</i>

11:44.495 --> 11:45.871
<i>Very nice to meet you.</i>

11:45.871 --> 11:48.207
<i>You, uh...
you flew in from New York?</i>

11:48.207 --> 11:49.542
<i>This morning.</i>

11:49.542 --> 11:51.502
<i>Why don't we all
have a seat, please?</i>

11:52.420 --> 11:54.672
<i>What can I do for you,
Mr. Calabri?</i>

11:54.672 --> 11:56.716
<i>We understand
that you're in need of</i>

11:56.716 --> 11:58.926
<i>a sizable infusion of capital.</i>

12:05.599 --> 12:08.686
<i>We are considering
taking on another investor.</i>

12:08.686 --> 12:09.895
We have an offer for you.

12:09.895 --> 12:12.189
<i>The eight figures that you need,</i>

12:12.189 --> 12:14.150
<i>same terms
you've given the others,</i>

12:14.150 --> 12:16.569
<i>with one additional item.</i>

12:16.569 --> 12:18.738
<i>We need access to your ports.</i>

12:19.905 --> 12:22.658
<i>Did I miss the news that
New York Harbor dried up?</i>

12:41.469 --> 12:43.304
<i>Jimmy, it's a good offer.</i>

12:46.140 --> 12:49.894
<i>How long would you want
to use... my ports?</i>

12:49.894 --> 12:51.103
Through the life of the loan.

12:51.103 --> 12:53.647
<i>After that, we can talk again.</i>

12:54.273 --> 12:59.403
<i>Anyone who knows me,
knows that I don't deal drugs.</i>

13:00.529 --> 13:04.325
<i>That's not the business
I want in my city.</i>

13:05.993 --> 13:09.455
<i>Nothing we bring in
stays in New Orleans.</i>

13:11.123 --> 13:12.625
Jimmy,

13:12.625 --> 13:15.795
<i>let's let these guys go
up to your rooms, relax,</i>

13:15.795 --> 13:17.797
<i>take a dip in the pool.</i>

13:17.797 --> 13:19.423
<i>We will meet up tonight.</i>

13:19.423 --> 13:22.718
<i>We'll eat, we'll drink,
we'll talk.</i>

13:24.136 --> 13:26.972
<i>tense, dramatic music</i>

13:35.147 --> 13:36.732
<i>When she told you
about our affair,</i>

13:36.732 --> 13:39.485
<i>I hoped that meant
she was ready to leave you.</i>

13:40.694 --> 13:41.987
<i>But she resisted.</i>

13:41.987 --> 13:43.823
<i>She and I had a fight
that night.</i>

13:43.823 --> 13:46.325
<i>And then she called you.
That's why I came here.</i>

13:46.325 --> 13:47.952
<i>She didn't call me that night.</i>

13:49.161 --> 13:50.996
<i>I heard her whispering
on the phone.</i>

13:50.996 --> 13:52.331
<i>It wasn't me.</i>

13:52.331 --> 13:54.208
Well, do you have any idea

13:54.208 --> 13:55.751
<i>who it might have been?</i>

14:00.714 --> 14:02.049
<i>I'm not out here in this swamp</i>

14:02.049 --> 14:03.551
<i>sweating through
my favorite blouse</i>

14:03.551 --> 14:06.679
<i>just to watch you refuse to
answer questions.</i>

14:09.223 --> 14:11.976
<i>There had been a string of hits.</i>

14:11.976 --> 14:15.813
<i>Upper-level members
of rival gangs.</i>

14:15.813 --> 14:17.773
<i>Eight in under a year.</i>

14:17.773 --> 14:19.692
<i>What's so intriguing
about a gang war?</i>

14:19.692 --> 14:23.362
<i>These weren't like gang hits.
They were clean.</i>

14:23.362 --> 14:25.698
<i>There was no brutality,</i>

14:25.698 --> 14:27.992
<i>there was no sending
of a message.</i>

14:27.992 --> 14:31.495
<i>It was just targeted executions.</i>

14:31.495 --> 14:33.831
<i>Never any witnesses.
Never any leads.</i>

14:33.831 --> 14:35.124
<i>All unsolved.</i>

14:35.124 --> 14:37.751
<i>So, what was
at the corner store?</i>

14:38.878 --> 14:40.129
<i>A witness.</i>

14:41.380 --> 14:43.007
<i>Tried to speak with him
days earlier,</i>

14:43.007 --> 14:45.050
<i>but he got spooked.</i>

14:45.050 --> 14:47.386
<i>He must have gotten
in contact with Robin.</i>

14:47.386 --> 14:49.388
<i>She was following up.
- What's his name?</i>

14:51.307 --> 14:53.517
<i>Please.</i>

14:53.517 --> 14:55.019
<i>KJ.</i>

14:57.980 --> 15:02.192
<i>He was gonna be the first to
confirm... our working theory.</i>

15:02.192 --> 15:04.069
<i>Which was what?</i>

15:05.321 --> 15:07.907
<i>It was cops doing
these killings.</i>

15:08.908 --> 15:11.577
<i>So, that's why
you hide out here?</i>

15:11.577 --> 15:13.537
<i>It's why I quit the story.</i>

15:13.537 --> 15:17.583
<i>And it's why I never revealed
any of this to the detectives.</i>

15:17.583 --> 15:21.337
<i>I couldn't trust who was clean
and who was dirty.</i>

15:21.337 --> 15:22.880
<i>Clearly, whoever was behind it</i>

15:22.880 --> 15:26.091
<i>wanted to make sure
the story died with us.</i>

15:26.091 --> 15:28.677
<i>I came out here because...</i>

15:28.677 --> 15:32.973
<i>I couldn't figure out how to
live my life with that pain.</i>

15:34.058 --> 15:37.019
<i>gentle, plaintive music</i>

15:39.939 --> 15:43.692
<i>She must have been so unhappy.</i>

15:46.654 --> 15:49.281
<i>I told her not to marry you.
- Jesus.</i>

15:51.075 --> 15:54.620
<i>I wasn't the worst husband
in the world.</i>

15:54.620 --> 15:56.830
<i>It wasn't you.
It was Robin.</i>

15:58.666 --> 16:02.127
<i>I was worried
she didn't love you enough.</i>

16:06.048 --> 16:08.008
<i>We had some good times.</i>

16:08.008 --> 16:10.260
<i>I know you did.</i>

16:10.260 --> 16:12.429
<i>Maybe I fought
too hard to keep her.</i>

16:12.429 --> 16:16.558
<i>I don't know, maybe
I should have just let her go.</i>

16:16.558 --> 16:18.769
<i>You couldn't have stopped her.</i>

16:18.769 --> 16:21.146
<i>It was Adam that kept her there.</i>

16:22.398 --> 16:24.942
<i>I have to know
what happened to my child.</i>

16:26.026 --> 16:29.822
<i>What if I told you
knowing doesn't help?</i>

16:29.822 --> 16:31.907
<i>I'd still want to know.</i>

16:40.040 --> 16:41.667
<i>What's wrong?
- Nothing.</i>

16:41.667 --> 16:43.419
<i>Carlo.</i>

16:43.419 --> 16:46.630
<i>Dad and Grandpa had a meeting,
and I wanted to join.</i>

16:46.630 --> 16:50.259
<i>And your father said no?</i>

16:50.259 --> 16:52.136
<i>I'm trying to do what he asks,</i>

16:52.136 --> 16:53.762
<i>but for what?</i>

16:53.762 --> 16:55.431
<i>To sit at a fucking desk,</i>

16:55.431 --> 16:57.683
<i>stare at security monitors
all day?</i>

16:58.892 --> 17:02.187
I'll talk to him.

17:02.187 --> 17:05.524
<i>Hi. He's sleeping.</i>

17:07.484 --> 17:09.278
<i>Okay.</i>

17:09.278 --> 17:10.863
<i>Carlo.
- Yeah.</i>

17:10.863 --> 17:13.157
<i>Um, he'll probably wake up
in a little bit.</i>

17:13.157 --> 17:15.826
<i>So just change him, feed him,
play with him,</i>

17:15.826 --> 17:18.370
<i>and then he'll probably
go back to sleep.</i>

17:18.370 --> 17:19.788
For how long?

17:19.788 --> 17:22.499
<i>That's the fun part.
You never know.</i>

17:22.499 --> 17:24.543
Look who's up.

17:27.254 --> 17:29.006
You sure you're up to this?

17:29.006 --> 17:31.550
<i>A little
godfather-godson bonding time</i>

17:31.550 --> 17:32.968
<i>will be good for them.</i>

17:32.968 --> 17:34.261
<i>He can handle it.</i>

17:35.763 --> 17:38.891
<i>You'll call us if you need us.
- I will.</i>

17:38.891 --> 17:41.477
Have fun.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.567
<i>Hey, little guy.
-</i>

17:48.567 --> 17:51.403
<i>Your Uncle Carlo is here.</i>

17:55.449 --> 17:58.035
<i>You look cute right now,</i>

17:58.035 --> 18:00.579
<i>but this is gonna be
boring as fuck.</i>

18:33.028 --> 18:35.531
<i>I don't like the idea of
giving the Calabris</i>

18:35.531 --> 18:37.407
<i>free rein of my docks.</i>

18:37.407 --> 18:41.620
<i>I need to know everything
that comes and goes.</i>

18:44.414 --> 18:47.751
<i>These docks are
how I ran the city.</i>

18:47.751 --> 18:52.214
<i>Nothing came in or out
unless I signed off.</i>

18:52.214 --> 18:55.175
<i>That's how I controlled everything.</i>

18:56.760 --> 18:59.388
<i>You're reluctant to share them</i>

18:59.388 --> 19:02.057
<i>because you don't want to
lose control.</i>

19:02.057 --> 19:05.811
<i>Here's the difference between
my control and your control.</i>

19:05.811 --> 19:09.273
<i>Your control is a figment of
your imagination.</i>

19:10.524 --> 19:15.487
<i>I see you in your pressed suits
and your pristine hotels.</i>

19:15.487 --> 19:20.492
<i>It's just an act
designed to fool one person...</i>

19:22.870 --> 19:27.833
<i>You trade on my name
and my reputation.</i>

19:27.833 --> 19:32.379
<i>And you act like a gangster
when it's convenient,</i>

19:32.379 --> 19:36.300
<i>and then you tell yourself,
"I'm just a businessman."</i>

19:41.471 --> 19:46.351
<i>You, you were very good
at what you did.</i>

19:48.061 --> 19:49.813
<i>So am I.</i>

19:49.813 --> 19:51.857
<i>My restaurants, my businesses,</i>

19:51.857 --> 19:53.859
<i>my...</i>

19:53.859 --> 19:57.362
<i>pristine hotels have
made you a very rich man.</i>

19:59.865 --> 20:02.618
<i>So have some respect
for what I do.</i>

20:05.245 --> 20:09.124
<i>When I was a little boy,
I used to run around</i>

20:09.124 --> 20:13.295
<i>this French Quarter
with my pal Mark.</i>

20:13.295 --> 20:15.130
<i>We come to this drug store.</i>

20:15.130 --> 20:20.052
<i>Candy, malts,
all that kind of stuff.</i>

20:20.052 --> 20:23.680
<i>We're salivating
over chocolates and taffy,</i>

20:23.680 --> 20:26.433
<i>but we didn't have any money.</i>

20:26.433 --> 20:30.187
<i>So when no one was looking...</i>

20:32.564 --> 20:35.567
<i>We go outside and I show Mark</i>

20:35.567 --> 20:38.570
<i>two pieces of black licorice.</i>

20:38.570 --> 20:42.074
<i>So we eat,
and they were fucking great.</i>

20:42.074 --> 20:44.701
<i>So we go into another store,</i>

20:44.701 --> 20:47.120
<i>and Mark's pointing out
everything he wants.</i>

20:47.120 --> 20:50.874
<i>This, that...
It's like Christmas.</i>

20:52.000 --> 20:55.462
<i>He's looking out,
I'm swiping stuff.</i>

20:55.462 --> 20:59.258
<i>Until, finally, I said to him,</i>

20:59.258 --> 21:01.760
<i>"You steal something this time."</i>

21:01.760 --> 21:03.512
<i>But Mark didn't want to do that.</i>

21:03.512 --> 21:06.932
<i>I asked him why not.
You know what he said?</i>

21:06.932 --> 21:09.601
<i>"I'm not a thief."</i>

21:11.270 --> 21:15.399
<i>You need the Calabris' money.</i>

21:15.399 --> 21:17.609
<i>And through your docks,</i>

21:17.609 --> 21:21.530
<i>they will bring in drugs,
they will bring in crime,</i>

21:21.530 --> 21:24.283
<i>they will bring in
women and girls,</i>

21:24.283 --> 21:28.954
<i>human beings sold into servitude
to other human beings.</i>

21:28.954 --> 21:32.958
<i>Through this city will pass
all manner of evil</i>

21:32.958 --> 21:34.584
<i>because of you.</i>

21:35.961 --> 21:39.756
<i>You think you're better than me,
you fucking son of a bitch?</i>

21:39.756 --> 21:42.301
<i>No. No, no, no, Jimmy.</i>

21:42.301 --> 21:45.429
<i>I'm done watching you
lie to yourself.</i>

21:45.429 --> 21:48.974
<i>You are nothing but a thug.</i>

21:48.974 --> 21:51.393
<i>Just like me.</i>

21:56.982 --> 21:59.651
<i>Zeus, Zeus, Zeus</i>

21:59.651 --> 22:00.986
<i>Said go and get a bag</i>

22:00.986 --> 22:02.904
<i>Zeus, Zeus, Zeus</i>

22:02.904 --> 22:05.615
<i>Go, go, go, if you going
softer than a Swisher</i>

22:05.615 --> 22:08.285
<i>Started from the bottom,
had to run it up again</i>

22:08.285 --> 22:10.912
<i>'Bout that money,
know a person...</i>

22:13.623 --> 22:15.459
<i>Who is it?</i>

22:15.459 --> 22:16.752
<i>Terrance.</i>

22:19.379 --> 22:20.839
<i>You're supposed to be at school.</i>

22:20.839 --> 22:23.091
<i>I'm on lunch.
Can I hang out?</i>

22:23.091 --> 22:25.135
<i>Hell no, you can't hang out.</i>

22:25.135 --> 22:26.636
<i>I thought you were the man now?</i>

22:26.636 --> 22:27.929
<i>I've been the man.</i>

22:27.929 --> 22:29.348
<i>But you know Moms
would kill my ass.</i>

22:29.348 --> 22:31.892
<i>She don't have to know.
- You know she would.</i>

22:33.101 --> 22:34.728
<i>Get on now.</i>

22:45.364 --> 22:47.074
<i>My shooters don't miss</i>

22:47.074 --> 22:48.575
<i>Got 'em pretty by my side,
she got one...</i>

22:50.702 --> 22:52.579
<i>And put one in your hip...</i>

22:54.998 --> 22:58.752
<i>ominous music</i>

22:58.752 --> 23:01.296
Holy shit.

23:39.126 --> 23:41.211
<i>Hi.</i>

23:41.211 --> 23:44.423
<i>Uh, we are looking for
a guy named KJ.</i>

23:44.423 --> 23:47.843
<i>He works here or at least he did
around two years ago.</i>

23:51.638 --> 23:53.223
<i>Do you know him?</i>

23:53.223 --> 23:54.808
<i>You cops?
- No.</i>

23:54.808 --> 23:57.727
<i>We're not cops.
I-I swear.</i>

23:57.727 --> 23:59.604
<i>You talk like one.</i>

24:01.314 --> 24:03.775
<i>I-I was a judge.</i>

24:05.694 --> 24:07.154
<i>You're the husband.</i>

24:07.154 --> 24:08.655
<i>Yes.</i>

24:12.617 --> 24:15.620
<i>So, does KJ still work here?
- No.</i>

24:15.620 --> 24:16.955
<i>Mm.</i>

24:17.581 --> 24:20.792
<i>All right. Then, do you know
where we can find him?</i>

24:26.506 --> 24:27.799
<i>All right, all right.</i>

24:29.259 --> 24:32.471
<i>Hi.
What's your name?</i>

24:36.141 --> 24:37.934
<i>I'm Elizabeth.</i>

24:37.934 --> 24:39.644
<i>I'm Robin's mother.</i>

24:44.107 --> 24:46.318
<i>Do you have any children?</i>

24:48.987 --> 24:50.697
<i>I got two girls.</i>

24:52.574 --> 24:55.035
<i>I really need to talk to KJ.</i>

25:07.214 --> 25:08.715
<i>Gina.</i>

25:08.715 --> 25:10.509
<i>Father Jay,
so nice to see you.</i>

25:10.509 --> 25:12.302
<i>You, too.</i>

25:12.302 --> 25:15.388
<i>This is my daughter Fia.
- Fia.</i>

25:15.388 --> 25:18.016
<i>Welcome.
- Hi.</i>

25:18.016 --> 25:20.519
Let me show you around.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.938
<i>Godparents will stand
on either side,</i>

25:22.938 --> 25:26.525
<i>representing not the family
but the Catholic Church.</i>

25:26.525 --> 25:28.652
<i>Parents stand right here.</i>

25:28.652 --> 25:29.694
<i>Uh...</i>

25:29.694 --> 25:32.113
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

25:32.113 --> 25:33.323
I'm sorry.

25:33.323 --> 25:35.617
<i>Uh, the mother stands here.</i>

25:36.910 --> 25:40.372
<i>And where do we pass through
the Kingdom of Heaven?</i>

25:40.372 --> 25:42.207
<i>Fia.</i>

25:42.207 --> 25:44.709
<i>I'll say a few words,</i>

25:44.709 --> 25:46.795
<i>um, just a few prayers.</i>

25:46.795 --> 25:49.714
<i>Yada yada God,
yada yada Jesus,</i>

25:49.714 --> 25:52.050
<i>splash of holy water,
presto-- baptized.</i>

25:52.050 --> 25:54.177
Sorry.

25:54.177 --> 25:56.721
<i>We're trying to save
a child's soul here.</i>

25:56.721 --> 25:59.140
<i>This is no laughing matter.</i>

26:02.394 --> 26:04.354
<i>Perhaps I could
speak with Sofia alone?</i>

26:04.354 --> 26:06.439
<i>Just for a, just for a minute.</i>

26:16.533 --> 26:18.076
<i>Skeptic?</i>

26:18.076 --> 26:19.786
<i>What gave it away?</i>

26:19.786 --> 26:22.205
<i>Your mother told me.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

26:24.082 --> 26:25.542
<i>I'm doing this for her.</i>

26:26.543 --> 26:29.087
<i>Well, there are worse reasons
to do things.</i>

26:29.087 --> 26:31.256
<i>Can we talk just for a minute</i>

26:31.256 --> 26:33.925
<i>about what this baptism
really means?</i>

26:33.925 --> 26:37.721
<i>So, like a jam session
with a cool priest?</i>

26:37.721 --> 26:39.681
<i>Um...</i>

26:39.681 --> 26:41.391
<i>Totally.</i>

26:41.391 --> 26:43.685
<i>Please.</i>

26:49.733 --> 26:51.860
<i>Okay.</i>

26:51.860 --> 26:55.280
<i>It is not my job to evaluate
people's qualifications</i>

26:55.280 --> 26:57.115
<i>for admittance into Catholicism.</i>

26:57.115 --> 27:00.160
<i>So you're not like
a bouncer at a bar.</i>

27:00.160 --> 27:02.329
I'm afraid not.

27:02.329 --> 27:04.623
<i>My job is...</i>

27:06.416 --> 27:09.669
<i>...is to invite you to have
a relationship with God,</i>

27:09.669 --> 27:11.463
<i>even if you don't believe
He exists.</i>

27:12.505 --> 27:14.424
<i>It doesn't bother you
that I don't believe?</i>

27:14.424 --> 27:15.842
<i>Not at all.</i>

27:16.885 --> 27:18.637
<i>You think it bothers God?</i>

27:21.681 --> 27:24.100
<i>Well, I've never known Him
to be a narcissist.</i>

27:25.435 --> 27:27.228
<i>Here's the truth.</i>

27:27.228 --> 27:31.983
<i>So much of what I deal with
is focused on the end of life,</i>

27:31.983 --> 27:34.986
<i>the struggles,
the difficulties...</i>

27:36.488 --> 27:38.323
<i>I love baptisms.</i>

27:40.241 --> 27:43.662
<i>I do because they, they present
the promise of a fresh start</i>

27:43.662 --> 27:48.333
<i>and you do not need to
share in my faith</i>

27:48.333 --> 27:50.669
<i>for us to have a common purpose
in this ritual, okay?</i>

27:50.669 --> 27:53.505
<i>Okay.
- Okay.</i>

27:53.505 --> 27:56.174
<i>Now, one of the reasons
that we do this</i>

27:56.174 --> 27:59.678
<i>is to officially bestow
a name upon the child.</i>

27:59.678 --> 28:03.682
<i>My faith tells me that
what we choose to call someone</i>

28:03.682 --> 28:05.433
<i>matters a great deal,</i>

28:05.433 --> 28:08.186

- No, please.</i>

33:39.017 --> 33:41.144
<i>You were working, right?
And so...</i>

33:41.144 --> 33:42.478
<i>I told the police
I didn't know anything.</i>

33:42.478 --> 33:44.188
But, but you saw...?

33:44.188 --> 33:45.481

<i>Why?
They won't help you.</i>

33:54.032 --> 33:56.826
<i>You don't know that.
- I do, actually.</i>

33:56.826 --> 33:58.369
<i>Because I know the answers</i>

33:58.369 --> 34:00.997
<i>and my life has been shit

<i>Just go back to

<i>And do your best

<i>KJ...
- I had to bury my daughter!</i>

my mama's house up.</i>

38:51.162 --> 38:53.247
<i>Killed my whole family.</i>

38:55.374 --> 38:58.002

40:13.411 --> 40:15.413
<i>Rival crews taking
each other out,</i>

40:15.413 --> 40:17.915
<i>but they couldn't get to
their top dogs.</i>

40:17.915 --> 40:19.417
<i>It was just
corner boys dropping.</i>

40:19.417 --> 40:20.960

<i>That's why it never got solved.</i>

40:29.427 --> 40:31.303
<i>How do you know this?</i>

40:36.642 --> 40:40.104
<i>One of the cops used to
trade me drugs for information.</i>

40:40.104 --> 40:43.107
<i>Eventually,
I ran out of information,</i>

40:43.107 --> 40:46.152
<i>but he still had
the drugs, so...</i>

40:46.152 --> 40:49.530
<i>he made me pay for it
in other ways.</i>

40:52.575 --> 40:55.077
<i>You had a relationship
with this cop.</i>

41:00.499 --> 41:04.462
<i>It was a fucked-up situation,
but he trusted me.</i>

41:04.462 --> 41:07.798
<i>Or at least trusted
that he could control me.</i>

41:09.133 --> 41:10.426
<i>So he talked.</i>

41:10.426 --> 41:13.137
<i>Spilled his guts
like I was his priest.</i>

41:13.137 --> 41:15.139
<i>He'd tell me about the shit
he did on the job,</i>

41:15.139 --> 41:16.640

41:16.640 --> 41:18.434
<i>Stealing drugs, money...</i>

41:18.434 --> 41:20.269
<i>Planting things on folks
that pissed him off.</i>

<i>Shit like that.</i>

he just shot a guy.</i>

I told him I was done.</i>

<i>I was trying to get clean.
Didn't want to see him anymore.</i>

41:46.712 --> 41:50.174

from this woman named Robin.</i>

<i>She said she's
working on a story</i>

41:55.054 --> 41:56.931
<i>I should have just kept
my fucking mouth shut,</i>

41:56.931 --> 41:58.849

my life was over anyway.</i>

41:58.849 --> 42:02.353
<i>I told her I knew that
cops were killing people</i>

42:02.353 --> 42:04.522
<i>and that I'd talk to her
when I got out.</i>

42:06.982 --> 42:08.817

I was getting cold feet</i>

<i>She didn't call you

42:16.158 --> 42:18.369
<i>Before she came here?
- No.</i>

42:18.369 --> 42:21.372
<i>Because I wouldn't have
been here if she did.</i>

42:21.372 --> 42:25.125
<i>She walked in
and he was right behind her.</i>

42:26.085 --> 42:27.670
<i>She barely makes it
to the register</i>

42:27.670 --> 42:30.381
<i>when he opened fire.</i>

42:30.381 --> 42:31.882
<i>She never saw it coming.</i>

42:35.886 --> 42:39.223
<i>So, you-you... you saw this?</i>

42:40.641 --> 42:43.602
<i>I saw a mask and gloves.</i>

42:43.602 --> 42:45.396
<i>But I knew it was him.</i>

42:45.396 --> 42:47.940
<i>You sure?
- I'm positive.</i>

42:47.940 --> 42:50.901
<i>KJ, tell us who he is.</i>

42:56.615 --> 42:58.325
<i>Please.</i>

42:59.827 --> 43:02.413
<i>We would never reveal your name.</i>

That's why we called you.</i>

44:03.390 --> 44:04.808
Was anyone else with him?

44:04.808 --> 44:07.144
<i>He said he was alone.
- Mm.</i>

44:10.814 --> 44:12.316
<i>You all right?</i>

44:26.372 --> 44:27.998

45:29.184 --> 45:30.644
Okay.

45:34.106 --> 45:37.025
<i>You were right.
It doesn't help.</i>

45:37.025 --> 45:39.820
<i>She's dead. She shouldn't be.
I already knew that.</i>

45:41.238 --> 45:43.741
<i>I just... I just didn't
want her to think</i>

45:43.741 --> 45:46.243
<i>I didn't care enough
to ask the questions.</i>

45:52.124 --> 45:53.542
Elizabeth.

45:54.918 --> 45:58.714
<i>I should have been there for you

<i>You were dealing with
your own loss.</i>

46:01.925 --> 46:04.136
<i>Yeah, but I...</i>

<i>I just didn't appreciate that</i>

46:13.270 --> 46:16.607
<i>he was your connection to
the child you'd lost.</i>

46:19.318 --> 46:23.614
<i>There is nothing quite like
the wonder of a grandchild.</i>

46:27.326 --> 46:29.369
<i>No, there's not.</i>

46:31.455 --> 46:34.041
<i>Elizabeth, I-I...</i>

46:34.041 --> 46:38.128
<i>I was going to wait to tell you.</i>

46:38.128 --> 46:40.964
<i>I don't know when.</i>

47:10.202 --> 47:11.370
<i>He's perfect.</i>

47:11.370 --> 47:13.330
<i>Oh.</i>

<i>Come here.</i>

47:16.083 --> 47:18.001

47:38.689 --> 47:40.482
<i>What were you doing

47:40.482 --> 47:42.943
<i>Carlo, how could you
leave my son</i>

47:42.943 --> 47:44.361
<i>with a fucking stranger?</i>

47:44.361 --> 47:45.863
<i>Fia, Fia.
- Can we talk about this later?</i>

47:45.863 --> 47:47.739
<i>No, I need an answer right now.</i>

47:48.866 --> 47:51.827
<i>Joey came to the hotel.</i>

47:51.827 --> 47:54.037
<i>He said he was
in the Lower Ninth earlier.</i>

47:54.037 --> 47:55.539
<i>And he saw Eugene Jones.</i>

47:59.209 --> 48:01.545
<i>I thought he was disposed of.
- So did I.</i>

48:01.545 --> 48:03.589
No, I saw him.

48:03.589 --> 48:06.049
<i>And I had the chance to
take the fucker out.</i>

48:06.049 --> 48:08.093
<i>So, did you?</i>

48:08.093 --> 48:10.220
<i>Did you "take the fucker out"?</i>

48:12.514 --> 48:14.224
<i>He tried to kill me.</i>

48:15.434 --> 48:17.895
<i>What is wrong with this family?</i>

48:17.895 --> 48:19.521

48:26.403 --> 48:29.197
<i>I was trapped in the car.
He got away.</i>

48:30.449 --> 48:32.743
<i>Frankie, I want that boy found. Tonight.</i>

48:32.743 --> 48:33.785
<i>I'll handle this.</i>

48:33.785 --> 48:35.871
<i>You had your chance!</i>

48:44.087 --> 48:46.048
<i>I need a word.</i>

48:46.048 --> 48:47.341
<i>Not right now.</i>

48:59.478 --> 49:01.605
<i>Look at me, James.</i>

49:04.274 --> 49:07.986

<i>Cusack has to call me back.</i>

49:36.348 --> 49:39.059
<i>Last I heard, Joey left town,
he was living on the streets.</i>

49:39.059 --> 49:42.145
<i>He should have been dead by now.
Our own cops even said so.</i>

49:43.355 --> 49:45.148
<i>I agree with Gina, Jim.</i>

49:45.148 --> 49:48.568
