WEBVTT

00:33.207 --> 00:34.991
So fall, that's
gonna be really nice.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.906
I think, September was

00:36.949 --> 00:38.864
- when we were thinking.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:38.908 --> 00:40.736
- Excuse me.
- Oh, so sorry.

00:40.779 --> 00:42.085
Sorry.

00:42.129 --> 00:44.696
Okay, so rosebuds
for the boutonnieres.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.046
- Right.
- And,

00:46.089 --> 00:47.438
what about your bouquet?

00:48.526 --> 00:50.137
Roses, red ones.

00:50.180 --> 00:51.268
Oh, yeah.

00:51.312 --> 00:52.704
- Definitely.
- She loves roses.

00:52.748 --> 00:55.098
I have something
perfect in mind for you.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.668
Yeah, yep.

00:59.711 --> 01:01.452
How do you like these?

01:01.496 --> 01:03.106
They're perfect.

01:04.107 --> 01:05.413
Great, wonderful.

01:07.719 --> 01:08.764
Yeah.

01:10.418 --> 01:12.768
This would be great for
the men's boutonnieres.

01:12.811 --> 01:15.205
Oh. Yeah, how do I look?

01:15.249 --> 01:16.598
Great.

01:16.641 --> 01:18.165
They go with
your smile too.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.557
Aw.

01:19.601 --> 01:21.472
Yeah, would you guys mind

01:21.516 --> 01:23.039
if I asked you both
something a bit personal?

01:23.083 --> 01:24.867
- Sure.
- Yeah.

01:24.910 --> 01:26.869
How did you know?

01:26.912 --> 01:28.697
How'd we know we were
meant for each other?

01:28.740 --> 01:32.309
I mean, yes, but like
how did you know it was worth

01:32.353 --> 01:34.920
giving up your
dreams for, you know?

01:34.964 --> 01:36.183
Well, that's easy.

01:36.226 --> 01:38.663
It wasn't about
giving up our dreams.

01:38.707 --> 01:39.882
We knew we could
still do them.

01:39.925 --> 01:40.883
Together.

01:40.926 --> 01:42.145
Yeah.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.497
Would you excuse me
for just one minute?

01:46.541 --> 01:47.890
Yeah.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.200
So, the turkey thing

01:53.243 --> 01:55.898
is going to be dinner,
you know.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.337
Hey, it's me.

02:01.382 --> 02:03.297
I've made my decision.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.910
I wanna run a couple
things by you.

02:07.953 --> 02:08.997
Great.

02:09.041 --> 02:10.695
I'll see you later.

02:22.359 --> 02:24.274
Sorry we're closed!

02:26.450 --> 02:28.974
Oh, hey,
you came to the shop.

02:29.018 --> 02:32.021
So, what I was
saying is, yeah,

02:32.064 --> 02:34.545
I was just really
struggling, you know,

02:34.589 --> 02:36.808
with the idea of
moving in together.

02:36.852 --> 02:39.202
But then I realized
we can be independent

02:39.246 --> 02:40.856
and still live together.

03:07.752 --> 03:10.233
What kind of
people live here I wonder.

03:34.083 --> 03:35.215
Excited to make friends?

03:37.217 --> 03:38.392
Yeah, but I can't really meet

03:38.435 --> 03:40.829
anyone new outside of school.

03:40.872 --> 03:42.483
It's summer, remember?

03:42.526 --> 03:44.920
I'm sure there'll be
kids in the neighborhood.

03:45.964 --> 03:47.705
I guess.

03:53.145 --> 03:54.973
Oh, is that where
the bakery is?

03:55.017 --> 03:56.410
Yes.

03:59.021 --> 04:00.283
It's cute, isn't it?

04:00.327 --> 04:01.197
I love it.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.855
Wow, this town is so small.

04:06.898 --> 04:08.683
I know, it is.

04:10.598 --> 04:11.686
It'll be good for us.

04:12.730 --> 04:13.470
Fresh start.

04:22.610 --> 04:23.654
Oh, no.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.398
Hmm, what?

04:28.442 --> 04:30.661
The fish your dad got me.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.933
Maybe we can glue
it back together.

04:41.977 --> 04:43.326
No, baby.

04:43.370 --> 04:44.893
I mean, it's almost
20 years old.

04:52.770 --> 04:53.771
I miss Dad.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.034
I do, too.

05:36.074 --> 05:38.468
-Hi.
-Hi.

05:38.512 --> 05:39.730
You must be Lena.

05:39.774 --> 05:40.949
I'm Heather from
the Boarding House

05:40.992 --> 05:41.950
coffee shop
across the street.

05:41.993 --> 05:43.386
Here, have a welcome cup.

05:43.430 --> 05:44.344
Thank you.

05:47.782 --> 05:50.741
Mmm, this is
really, really good.

05:50.785 --> 05:52.569
No, like really good.

05:52.613 --> 05:55.746
I source from the best
farmers in Central America.

05:55.790 --> 05:57.574
Only the best
for my customers.

05:57.618 --> 06:00.142
And your new neighbors.

06:00.185 --> 06:01.970
So, how is business
around here?

06:02.013 --> 06:03.450
I think
you're gonna do fine.

06:03.493 --> 06:05.103
I got an idea.
Why don't you

06:05.147 --> 06:07.018
grab some of those cupcakes,

06:07.062 --> 06:09.107
and I'll introduce
you to the gang, huh?

06:09.151 --> 06:10.239
Alright, sounds good.

06:11.719 --> 06:13.503
Things around here are
turn of the century

06:13.547 --> 06:14.983
like red brick, you know.

06:15.984 --> 06:17.072
They're just gorgeous.

06:17.115 --> 06:19.291
Yeah, it's super
laid back energy.

06:19.335 --> 06:20.684
I think, you guys are
gonna really like it.

06:20.728 --> 06:21.816
It's what I'm looking for.

06:21.859 --> 06:23.339
Yeah.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.775
- Oh, my God, hey, girl.
- Hey, how's it going?

06:24.819 --> 06:26.603
- Good.
- This is Lena.

06:26.647 --> 06:27.735
She's the new baker--

06:27.778 --> 06:29.432
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

06:29.476 --> 06:30.868
Oh, my God.

06:30.912 --> 06:32.435
Have a cupcake.

06:32.479 --> 06:34.306
My trainer is gonna kill me.

06:37.135 --> 06:39.921
Mmm, oh, my God, thank you.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.488
So, I'll see you
at yoga later?

06:42.271 --> 06:43.577
Yeah.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.143
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:45.187 --> 06:46.362
So, now let's go check out...

06:56.154 --> 06:57.765
- Hey.
- Hey, Jenny.

06:57.808 --> 07:00.115
This is Lena.
She brought cupcakes.

07:00.158 --> 07:01.508
- Hi.
- Oh, wow.

07:01.551 --> 07:03.901
Okay, well, you must
be the new baker?

07:03.945 --> 07:05.425
Guilty.

07:05.468 --> 07:08.166
I really, really shouldn't.

07:08.210 --> 07:09.341
Oh, come on,
one little cupcake's

07:09.385 --> 07:10.908
not gonna do anything, Jenny.

07:10.952 --> 07:13.607
I promise they're clean,

07:13.650 --> 07:16.174
100% GMO and pesticide free,

07:16.218 --> 07:18.829
handmade using only
local ingredients.

07:18.873 --> 07:20.788
Okay, okay, okay,
you got me.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.921
Gosh, how can I resist?

07:23.965 --> 07:27.011
You know what I will take one
for my son because he is 17,

07:27.055 --> 07:29.492
and his metabolism
can handle it.

07:29.536 --> 07:31.276
I actually have a
daughter his age.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.713
Oh, that's perfect we
should introduce them.

07:32.756 --> 07:34.497
Maybe he could show
her around town.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.238
Oh, yeah, that would be great.

07:36.281 --> 07:37.718
How about you you're
gonna be at yoga tomorrow?

07:37.761 --> 07:39.502
Of course.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.069
Hey, Lena, you should come.
Casey will be there too.

07:41.112 --> 07:42.462
Yeah.

07:42.505 --> 07:44.202
Okay, sounds fun.

07:44.246 --> 07:45.943
Great, it's settled
I'll put ya in.

07:47.510 --> 07:50.905
So, we can go ahead and
just skip this place.

07:50.948 --> 07:53.516
Hardware store guy
doesn't like cupcakes.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.518
No, Michael's
a big health nut.

07:55.562 --> 07:58.478
Well, shouldn't I just
go in and introduce myself?

07:58.521 --> 08:00.654
I wouldn't.

08:00.697 --> 08:04.135
In fact, I would stay away
from him if you could.

08:04.179 --> 08:06.094
Why?

08:06.137 --> 08:07.269
He's a womanizer
and he's dangerous.

08:07.312 --> 08:08.705
Hello, Heather.

08:08.749 --> 08:09.793
You keeping out of trouble?

08:09.837 --> 08:11.229
Very funny, Hank.

08:11.273 --> 08:14.102
Don't you have some
streets you need to patrol?

08:14.145 --> 08:16.191
If patrol means standing around

08:16.234 --> 08:18.062
looking at beautiful
women, I'd say absolutely.

08:18.106 --> 08:19.629
You have
a new friend here, huh?

08:19.673 --> 08:21.109
Oh, yes, this is Lena.
She's the new baker.

08:21.152 --> 08:22.414
Hello, Lena,
nice meeting you.

08:22.458 --> 08:23.546
Hi. Cupcake?

08:23.590 --> 08:24.852
Oh, thank you very much.

08:24.895 --> 08:26.723
No, I'm trying to, you know.

08:26.767 --> 08:29.378
Hey, Heather.
Who's your friend?

08:29.421 --> 08:31.641
I'm Lena. I opened
the new bakery.

08:31.685 --> 08:33.294
Would you like
a sample cupcake?

08:33.337 --> 08:35.078
Kiddin' me? Absolutely.

08:41.346 --> 08:43.260
Wow.

08:43.304 --> 08:45.786
Wow, this is delicious.

08:45.829 --> 08:47.309
Maybe worth
a cheat day, huh?

08:47.352 --> 08:48.615
Everyday is
a cheat day for me.

08:48.658 --> 08:49.964
I could eat
six more of these--

08:50.007 --> 08:51.574
Okay, Michael, we've gotta go.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.576
Don't let me keep you.
Nice to meet you, Lena.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.012
- You too.
- Thanks for the cupcake, huh?

08:55.056 --> 08:56.144
- You're welcome.
- Bye-bye, Heather.

08:56.187 --> 08:57.232
- Bye, Hank.
- Nice meeting you.

09:01.671 --> 09:03.978
It's a shame
this isn't open.

09:09.157 --> 09:11.289
We could've done
weddings together.

09:14.684 --> 09:15.772
It was heartbreaking.

09:17.078 --> 09:18.514
She was really cool.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.907
What happened?

09:19.950 --> 09:21.561
This is Beth's flower shop.

09:21.604 --> 09:24.302
She was my best
friend, like a sister,

09:24.346 --> 09:26.217
and then one day
she texted Michael,

09:26.261 --> 09:27.654
said that she was leaving.

09:29.003 --> 09:30.221
Since then nobody's gotten

09:30.265 --> 09:32.572
a single call
or text from her.

09:32.615 --> 09:36.532
She just left and
never came back.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.187
I'm so sorry.

09:39.230 --> 09:40.754
I mean, if you guys
were such good friends,

09:40.797 --> 09:42.538
I'm sure
she had a good reason

09:42.582 --> 09:44.366
for leaving
without telling you.

09:46.281 --> 09:47.630
I don't think she did.

09:59.250 --> 10:01.513
Apparently, no one's
ever seen her again.

10:03.907 --> 10:05.169
That's so weird.

10:06.344 --> 10:08.042
Wonder what happened to her?

10:08.085 --> 10:10.305
I don't know, but it's not
like there's a murderer

10:10.348 --> 10:12.089
running around the town.

10:12.133 --> 10:14.396
But Heather insists
there's something wrong.

10:17.051 --> 10:19.619
I just think she's
being a little paranoid.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.229
Let's hope it's just that.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.368
What was that?

10:31.326 --> 10:33.110
I don't know.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.655
Who's there?

10:57.352 --> 10:59.049
We have a knife.

11:02.400 --> 11:03.880
Hey.

11:03.924 --> 11:05.882
Hey, sorry.

11:05.926 --> 11:07.318
My ball went over the fence.

11:07.362 --> 11:09.277
I didn't know anyone
lived here yet.

11:11.061 --> 11:13.107
You didn't see the
moving van yesterday?

11:13.150 --> 11:15.892
Do you always hop
over people's fences?

11:15.936 --> 11:17.720
Only when it's late at night.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.942
Well, next time just
knock on our door, okay?

11:21.985 --> 11:24.205
Sure thing, yeah.

11:24.248 --> 11:25.685
I'm Charlie by the way.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.817
I'm Lena Mitchell.
This is my daughter Ashley.

11:27.861 --> 11:31.734
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.170
Nice to meet you.

11:33.214 --> 11:34.824
You too.

11:34.868 --> 11:35.956
Well, I should probably
be getting back.

11:35.999 --> 11:38.045
My mom's probably freaking out.

11:38.088 --> 11:39.699
Well, see ya.

11:39.742 --> 11:42.136
Charlie.
Use the door.

11:44.051 --> 11:45.269
Right.

11:46.575 --> 11:48.446
It's that one right there?

11:48.490 --> 11:49.796
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

12:03.548 --> 12:05.507
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:05.550 --> 12:06.464
Hello.

12:07.378 --> 12:08.771
This is for you.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.338
Aw, you shouldn't have.

12:10.381 --> 12:13.515
I really appreciate you
showing me around yesterday.

12:13.558 --> 12:15.256
Well, it
was my pleasure.

12:15.299 --> 12:17.737
You know, why don't
we slice this up,

12:17.780 --> 12:20.000
and give it out to your
customers for free?

12:20.043 --> 12:21.218
Good idea, I'm gonna
grab some plates.

12:21.262 --> 12:22.785
Okay.

12:22.829 --> 12:23.960
Are you trying to
karate chop me?

12:24.004 --> 12:25.570
No, I'm like a hardware ninja.

12:25.614 --> 12:28.704
Oh, okay.
Okay.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.272
Do you ever listen to
true crime podcasts

12:31.315 --> 12:32.621
or those docs on Netflix?

12:32.664 --> 12:34.536
Not really, no.

12:34.579 --> 12:37.147
Oh, okay.

12:38.279 --> 12:39.759
Everything alright?

12:39.802 --> 12:42.239
Yeah, I don't know.

12:43.414 --> 12:45.634
Michael and Casey.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.812
I just hope she's careful.

12:49.856 --> 12:52.510
Aren't you being a
little too hard on them?

12:53.860 --> 12:55.513
I have a bad
feeling about him.

12:55.557 --> 12:57.689
I hope you have a
good feeling about me.

12:57.733 --> 13:00.083
Of course, I do.
You're one of the girls.

13:00.127 --> 13:01.868
Let's pass these out.

13:07.395 --> 13:08.788
Here you go, ladies.

13:08.831 --> 13:09.963
It's on the house, okay.

13:12.182 --> 13:13.096
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

13:13.140 --> 13:13.880
Thanks.

13:15.838 --> 13:18.014
From the new
baker up the street.

13:18.058 --> 13:19.189
Oh.

13:19.233 --> 13:20.843
- For free.
- Thank you.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.149
Don't do that.

13:25.021 --> 13:26.414
Oh, perfect.

13:26.457 --> 13:28.111
You know how I told
you I was worried

13:28.155 --> 13:30.070
that something happened
to Beth, the florist?

13:30.113 --> 13:31.680
Mm-hmm.

13:31.723 --> 13:34.552
Well, she was dating
Michael when she left town.

13:38.339 --> 13:41.168
Well, it explains why
he's flirting with Casey.

13:41.211 --> 13:44.171
Michael seems so
caring and attentive,

13:44.214 --> 13:46.695
but that's usually
who's behind the murder,

13:46.738 --> 13:48.740
the caring and
attentive husband.

13:48.784 --> 13:50.220
They weren't even married.

13:50.264 --> 13:52.179
They practically were though.

13:53.223 --> 13:54.181
Hey.

13:54.224 --> 13:55.660
Hey, girl, hey.

13:55.704 --> 13:56.705
Hello.

13:58.838 --> 14:02.015
Wow, okay. Alright.
Cake after yoga?

14:02.058 --> 14:03.016
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

14:04.539 --> 14:07.107
So I see
the flirting continues.

14:07.150 --> 14:08.499
Mm-hmm.

14:10.240 --> 14:13.940
Has he asked her out yet?

14:13.983 --> 14:15.202
No idea.

14:15.245 --> 14:18.074
She seems to really
enjoy the attention.

14:18.118 --> 14:19.684
Nothing wrong with that.

14:34.003 --> 14:35.265
Coming.

14:38.878 --> 14:42.316
Hey, I'm almost done.
Come on in.

14:42.359 --> 14:44.361
I'm just cleaning up.

14:45.275 --> 14:46.015
What's going on?

14:47.321 --> 14:49.062
My God, why are
you wearing that?

14:50.106 --> 14:52.021
It's so hot.

14:52.065 --> 14:54.110
Did you try Lena's cake?

14:54.154 --> 14:56.112
It was so good.

14:56.156 --> 14:58.245
Oh, my God, I am so
glad she moved here.

14:58.288 --> 15:01.248
You know what?
She is so sweet.

15:01.291 --> 15:02.510
I really like her.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.688
I just got
some new tops in too.

15:06.731 --> 15:08.690
I'm actually wearing
one, you know.

15:41.331 --> 15:42.419
Okay.

15:44.769 --> 15:47.468
I hate putting
furniture together.

15:47.511 --> 15:49.165
Come on, it's fun.

15:49.209 --> 15:50.340
It's like a puzzle.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.126
Lay all the pieces out.

15:59.697 --> 16:02.048
Where's the...

16:02.091 --> 16:03.484
the metal thing?

16:03.527 --> 16:06.313
What metal thing?

16:06.356 --> 16:08.532
Like the L shaped metal stick.

16:08.576 --> 16:10.665
Oh, the Allen wrench.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.014
It should be in there.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.320
Nope.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.279
No.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.847
Alright. Well then, we'll
go to the hardware store.

16:32.382 --> 16:33.949
You work here?

16:33.993 --> 16:35.995
Oh, hey.
Yeah, just for the summer.

16:37.083 --> 16:37.997
Cool.

16:39.868 --> 16:42.523
So can you help us
find Allen wrenches,

16:42.566 --> 16:46.222
and you don't have to jump
over any aisles though.

16:46.266 --> 16:48.790
Just give me a second.

16:48.833 --> 16:51.053
Hey, girls.

16:52.489 --> 16:55.057
I don't recommend
sneaking up on customers.

16:55.101 --> 16:57.625
Kind of like a
ninja around here.

16:57.668 --> 17:00.323
Yep, you can call me
Michael, hardware ninja.

17:03.196 --> 17:04.240
Follow me.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.079
Here they are.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.733
Maybe you should label
things or something.

17:18.776 --> 17:20.473
Yeah, I should get
around to that, huh?

17:20.517 --> 17:22.867
Yeah, we'd be able
to find things.

17:22.911 --> 17:24.608
I could probably find
the time to do that.

17:24.652 --> 17:26.915
What size you say
you need again?

17:26.958 --> 17:29.091
I brought the instructions.

17:30.179 --> 17:31.746
I got it.

17:34.357 --> 17:37.273
Looks like there might
be a little puppy love

17:37.317 --> 17:39.536
between Charlie and
your daughter, huh?

17:39.580 --> 17:41.625
Yeah, she grew up way too fast.

17:42.887 --> 17:44.802
Here we go.

17:44.846 --> 17:47.631
One Allen key for
one coffee table.

17:48.415 --> 17:50.112
Thank you.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.418
I could come over
and help you

17:51.461 --> 17:53.594
build that thing,
if you want?

17:53.637 --> 17:55.248
I think, I'm good.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.640
Girls can build things too.

17:57.728 --> 17:58.990
No, I just meant...

18:01.254 --> 18:02.733
I'm saying all the wrong
things today, aren't I?

18:02.777 --> 18:05.258
No, you're good.

18:05.301 --> 18:06.346
Thanks for the help.

18:06.389 --> 18:07.347
- Yeah.
- Gotta go.

18:07.390 --> 18:08.304
You're welcome.

18:10.872 --> 18:11.786
Bye.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.966
You're doing really well.

18:18.009 --> 18:20.055
Have you done yoga before?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.144
Not much.

18:22.188 --> 18:23.928
Are you
enjoying the sessions?

18:23.972 --> 18:26.453
Definitely, I mean, I was
never able to get into Crow,

18:26.496 --> 18:29.804
but now it just it clicked

18:29.847 --> 18:32.023
when you said look in
front of me and not down.

18:32.067 --> 18:33.286
That's the trick.

18:33.329 --> 18:34.200
Hey, where's Casey?

18:35.549 --> 18:37.899
We missed her energy today.

18:37.942 --> 18:40.206
She's usually always
here on Tuesdays.

18:40.249 --> 18:42.033
I'm sure she'll
be here tomorrow.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.298
I should text her.

18:45.341 --> 18:48.518
Okay, that is so cute.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.868
Thanks, I do love coffee.

18:52.435 --> 18:54.350
Oh, I heard that
Charlie ran into

18:54.394 --> 18:55.612
you and your daughter
at the hardware store.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.745
Yes, he did.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.529
Yeah, he came home, and
he was talking about

18:59.573 --> 19:02.619
how he thinks Ashley
is kind of cute.

19:02.663 --> 19:05.100
Well, I hear that he's
a bit of a ladies man.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.058
What? No.

19:07.102 --> 19:08.451
You can't believe that.

19:08.495 --> 19:10.671
He's never even had
a real girlfriend.

19:10.714 --> 19:12.194
Well, speaking of ladies men,

19:12.238 --> 19:14.805
I hear that Michael likes
to play the field a lot.

19:14.849 --> 19:16.416
Oh, I almost forget
I did some digging

19:16.459 --> 19:17.765
into Michael's past
last night.

19:17.808 --> 19:19.375
- Heather.
- Check this out.

19:20.942 --> 19:22.944
He was a semi-pro fighter.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.859
He killed a guy
during a fight.

19:24.902 --> 19:26.121
Heather, haven't we
been through this enough?

19:26.165 --> 19:27.253
Michael's not a killer.

19:29.733 --> 19:31.474
Hey, ladies.

19:31.518 --> 19:33.041
- Michael.
- Come on let's go.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.912
I'm here for my one on one.

19:34.956 --> 19:37.088
Don't mean to
interrupt though.

19:37.132 --> 19:39.613
Lena and I were just leaving.

19:39.656 --> 19:41.484
Why don't you go ahead
and put your things

19:41.528 --> 19:43.530
down over there and lay on the
mat when you're ready.

19:43.573 --> 19:45.880
Sure.
Right here, okay?

19:45.923 --> 19:47.273
Yeah, it's perfect.

19:47.316 --> 19:49.013
Hey, can you text me
when your session's over?

19:49.057 --> 19:50.014
Sure, why?

19:51.755 --> 19:53.844
I just wanna talk to
you about something.

19:53.888 --> 19:56.369
Um, okay.

19:56.412 --> 19:57.413
Let's go.

20:14.343 --> 20:16.258
Hey, Ashley.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.651
My ball went over
the fence again.

20:17.694 --> 20:20.044
Do you mind getting it for me?

20:20.088 --> 20:22.699
Why don't you hop over the
fence and get it yourself?

20:22.743 --> 20:24.310
Well, I mean, I would but
you're sitting right there.

20:24.353 --> 20:26.529
That'd be rude.
I don't wanna be rude, so.

20:34.711 --> 20:36.322
How bad of a basketball
player do you have to be

20:36.365 --> 20:38.585
to keep losing your
ball over the fence?

20:38.628 --> 20:40.195
Oh, I'm terrible.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.327
I mean, I'm really bad.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.462
So do you wanna play
a game or something?

20:48.159 --> 20:49.335
Yeah, let's do it.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.256
I think, you need more
practice in the paint.

20:57.299 --> 21:00.302
Okay, you're not as
bad as you say you are.

21:04.088 --> 21:07.091
I was champion of my third
grade basketball team.

21:07.135 --> 21:09.442
Oh, yeah. Yeah?

21:11.922 --> 21:14.098
How do you like working
at the hardware store?

21:15.056 --> 21:17.798
Uh, I don't.

21:19.190 --> 21:20.888
Then why do it?

21:24.065 --> 21:26.502
My mom wanted me to
get a summer job.

21:26.546 --> 21:28.722
Keep me out of trouble.

21:28.765 --> 21:32.073
Did you mean to throw the
basketball over the fence?

21:32.987 --> 21:34.902
Maybe.

21:41.082 --> 21:43.127
You wanna see my room?

21:46.740 --> 21:48.872
Hey, so, I gotta
show you something.

21:48.916 --> 21:50.613
- Okay.
- I'll meet you at the desk.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.194
You need a new hobby.

22:06.237 --> 22:08.414
I found this in the
alleyway behind Beth's shop

22:08.457 --> 22:10.024
a few days after
she went missing.

22:10.067 --> 22:12.113
You mean left town.

22:13.201 --> 22:14.376
Look.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.378
It's got initials on it.

22:16.422 --> 22:19.642
Beth gave this to
Michael for his birthday.

22:19.686 --> 22:22.689
So, he threw out a gift
from his girlfriend

22:22.732 --> 22:24.299
after she left town.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.432
That's a pretty
normal thing to do.

22:26.475 --> 22:28.347
I think,
he used it to kill her,

22:28.390 --> 22:30.218
and then tried
to get rid of it.

22:30.261 --> 22:33.090
By throwing it out
behind her shop

22:33.134 --> 22:35.745
literally with his name on it.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.532
And it's clean.

22:39.575 --> 22:42.099
Well, I'm sure he cleaned it

22:42.143 --> 22:43.971
after he killed her with it.

22:46.669 --> 22:49.498
Look, Heather, you are great,

22:49.542 --> 22:52.022
and I am super thankful
for your friendship.

22:52.066 --> 22:54.677
But you're being really
weird about this.

22:54.721 --> 22:57.071
You know, she's been
gone for a while.

22:57.114 --> 23:00.204
You're just
torturing yourself.

23:00.248 --> 23:01.162
You need to let her go.

23:04.121 --> 23:06.646
She's dead.

23:06.689 --> 23:07.908
I know she's dead.

23:07.951 --> 23:08.865
She would've said goodbye.

23:08.909 --> 23:11.694
Hey, hey, it's okay.

23:11.738 --> 23:13.870
I'm sure Beth is fine.

23:13.914 --> 23:15.959
You're just overworked.

23:16.003 --> 23:18.135
I see how many hours you're
putting into this place.

23:20.442 --> 23:21.922
I know it sounds crazy.

23:23.140 --> 23:25.229
I just miss Beth a lot.

23:25.273 --> 23:26.709
I know.

23:26.753 --> 23:29.799
But you just need a few
extra hours of sleep,

23:29.843 --> 23:33.499
and cut out the murder TV
and podcasts for a while.

23:36.327 --> 23:37.894
You know,
what if I ask Ashley

23:37.938 --> 23:39.940
if she would work here
for a few days a week.

23:39.983 --> 23:41.811
How's that sound?

23:41.855 --> 23:44.466
Yeah, that would help actually.

23:44.510 --> 23:47.469
And maybe you could
actually take a day off.

23:47.513 --> 23:49.253
Yeah.

23:49.297 --> 23:50.254
Put that away.

23:57.261 --> 23:58.306
Ashley, where are you?

24:02.919 --> 24:05.487
I hope you're ready for
Guthrie's best slice.

24:09.796 --> 24:11.014
Look what I got.

24:12.886 --> 24:14.931
I didn't hear you come in.

24:14.975 --> 24:17.499
That's because I was
gonna surprise you.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.109
Hey, Mrs. Mitchell.

24:19.153 --> 24:20.502
Charlie.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.504
Can Charlie stay for pizza?

24:22.548 --> 24:24.941
Hmm, maybe another time.

24:24.985 --> 24:26.987
Yeah, I should probably
get going anyway.

24:27.030 --> 24:28.423
Okay, bye,
I'll see you later.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.946
- See ya.
- Say hi to your mom.

24:29.990 --> 24:30.860
I will.

24:32.471 --> 24:36.083
So, you wanna watch that
show about the pizza guy

24:36.126 --> 24:37.954
who straps a bomb
to his chest?

24:39.260 --> 24:40.827
That's a bit dark,
don't you think?

24:40.870 --> 24:42.611
Hmm, maybe.

24:45.962 --> 24:49.096
So, Heather
just keeps pushing

24:49.139 --> 24:51.751
this murderer
conspiracy thing.

24:52.621 --> 24:53.840
I mean, I don't get it.

24:53.883 --> 24:56.146
I mean, she's so broken up

24:56.190 --> 24:57.844
about her friend leaving town

24:57.887 --> 25:00.673
that she's making
up stories now.

25:00.716 --> 25:02.196
I change my mind.

25:02.239 --> 25:04.720
I think, we should
watch it for research.

25:04.764 --> 25:05.765
Oh, God.

25:07.854 --> 25:09.072
And Charlie helped
me set up the Wi-Fi,

25:09.116 --> 25:11.161
so we're ready to
stream whenever.

25:12.075 --> 25:14.208
Speaking of Charlie,

25:14.251 --> 25:15.862
you are way too young

25:15.905 --> 25:17.559
to have a boy in your room.

25:17.603 --> 25:20.214
We weren't doing anything.

25:20.257 --> 25:23.260
I know, but I am not comfortable
with him being in there

25:23.304 --> 25:25.001
especially when I'm not home.

25:26.089 --> 25:28.091
Why don't you just trust me.

25:28.135 --> 25:29.963
It's not that, honey.

25:30.006 --> 25:34.141
We... we just don't really
know Charlie very well.

25:35.316 --> 25:36.665
I'm getting to know him.

25:36.709 --> 25:39.799
Look, next year you're
gonna be in college.

25:39.842 --> 25:42.453
You can do whatever you want.

25:42.497 --> 25:47.328
But just take this last year
in high school slow for me.

25:49.156 --> 25:50.287
You just don't get it.

25:51.158 --> 25:52.507
I do actually.

25:52.551 --> 25:53.595
Doubtful.

25:55.423 --> 25:57.294
Heather, you alone?

25:58.426 --> 26:00.602
Maybe.
What do you want?

26:00.646 --> 26:02.778
This has gotta stop.

26:02.822 --> 26:04.040
I don't know what
you're talking about.

26:04.084 --> 26:05.955
The harassment.
It's ridiculous.

26:05.999 --> 26:08.305
- Wasn't it true?
- It is not true.

26:08.349 --> 26:10.438
Isn't it true you
killed someone?

26:21.580 --> 26:22.755
I'm gonna stop you.

26:22.798 --> 26:24.626
This is the last
time I'm telling you.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.149
Leave me alone.

26:27.934 --> 26:29.022
Or what?

26:31.067 --> 26:32.329
You'll be sorry.

26:39.423 --> 26:40.642
Wow.

26:42.470 --> 26:44.254
What was that about?

26:44.298 --> 26:47.344
Uh, he just wants
me off his trail.

26:49.172 --> 26:50.565
I need some tea
you want some tea?

26:50.609 --> 26:53.176
Yeah. Yeah, honey,
I'd love some tea.

26:57.311 --> 26:58.573
So what's the latest?

26:59.574 --> 27:01.228
Besides that just now.

27:03.143 --> 27:04.971
Thank you.

27:06.102 --> 27:07.408
Breath.

27:11.325 --> 27:12.674
Come on, you can tell me.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.197
I know how you get
all lathered up

27:14.241 --> 27:16.504
after listening
to your podcasts.

27:18.549 --> 27:21.422
This thing with Michael,

27:21.465 --> 27:23.119
it's not because you have
a crush on him, is it?

27:23.163 --> 27:24.773
Absolutely not.

27:24.817 --> 27:25.992
Okay.

27:28.342 --> 27:30.387
I told Lena about
the hammer thing.

27:30.431 --> 27:32.476
Oh, God.
That nonsense.

27:32.520 --> 27:33.826
What'd she say?

27:33.869 --> 27:35.915
Same thing you did.

27:35.958 --> 27:37.917
Serial killers
aren't that dumb.

27:39.570 --> 27:40.702
You feel better now?

27:40.746 --> 27:43.357
No, Casey's still missing.

27:44.619 --> 27:46.316
But maybe she just,

27:46.360 --> 27:48.710
I don't know, needed
some time to herself.

27:48.754 --> 27:50.494
Should we contact her family?

27:50.538 --> 27:53.715
No, I don't think
it's that serious.

27:53.759 --> 27:56.762
She just wouldn't disappear
like this, you know?

27:56.805 --> 27:59.242
She's too polite,
too trusting.

28:00.766 --> 28:03.203
I know she got herself
in trouble somehow.

28:03.246 --> 28:05.074
The polite and trusting
ones always do.

28:05.118 --> 28:07.598
I think you need
to switch to decaf.

28:16.738 --> 28:21.134
So this is a hip
flexor, Child's Pose.

28:22.222 --> 28:23.876
So widen out your knees

28:23.919 --> 28:25.747
and sit back on your heels.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.140
Yeah, that's good.

28:29.446 --> 28:31.318
Great job.

28:31.361 --> 28:33.712
Reach your fingertips towards

28:33.755 --> 28:35.409
the top of the classroom.

28:37.019 --> 28:39.456
In throw your nose,
out throw your mouth.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.548
Beautiful job, Lena.

28:45.811 --> 28:46.855
Great.

28:46.899 --> 28:48.988
Now when you're ready,

28:49.031 --> 28:52.295
we're gonna come
up onto all fours

28:52.339 --> 28:54.907
and we're going to
do lion's breath.

28:58.824 --> 29:03.089
So we're all gonna take a
deep inhale through our nose,

29:03.132 --> 29:05.569
and on the exhale you
stick out your tongue

29:05.613 --> 29:10.313
and release the breath
with an "ahh" sound.

29:10.357 --> 29:11.619
Ready?

29:15.884 --> 29:17.843
Ahh!

29:17.886 --> 29:20.454
Ahh.

29:20.497 --> 29:22.282
Now we're going to transition

29:22.325 --> 29:24.980
into everybody's
favorite, Corpse Pose.

29:26.373 --> 29:28.767
So get comfortable
on your backs.

29:30.420 --> 29:34.033
Snuggle your shoulders
underneath you.

29:34.076 --> 29:36.644
Open your palms,

29:36.687 --> 29:39.299
and let your feet fall

29:39.342 --> 29:42.041
wherever they do.

29:43.999 --> 29:46.480
And take this moment

29:46.523 --> 29:49.483
to really thank your body.

29:52.312 --> 29:58.492
Only rise when your
body compels you to.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.364
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

30:01.408 --> 30:02.365
- Thank you.
- Hmm-mm.

30:02.409 --> 30:04.193
I just wanted to say,

30:04.237 --> 30:06.848
I really
found my breath today.

30:06.892 --> 30:09.720
Oh, fantastic, Aticus.

30:10.852 --> 30:12.506
Namaste.

30:12.549 --> 30:13.507
Namaste.

30:17.728 --> 30:19.121
There you are.

30:19.165 --> 30:20.383
Great, class, Jenny.

30:20.427 --> 30:22.995
I'm so glad
that you enjoyed it.

30:23.038 --> 30:24.997
So I caught,

30:25.040 --> 30:27.608
Charlie and Ashley in
her bedroom last night.

30:27.651 --> 30:29.305
- Oh.
- Not super happy about it.

30:29.349 --> 30:33.353
Uh... did you
talk to Ashley about it?

30:33.396 --> 30:35.572
Yeah, I did.

30:35.616 --> 30:37.574
I hope you talked to Charlie

30:37.618 --> 30:39.489
about boundaries with girls.

30:39.533 --> 30:41.361
Yes. Oh, my God.

30:41.404 --> 30:43.145
You don't have to
worry about Charlie.

30:43.189 --> 30:45.104
Honestly, he's a
very, very sweet,

30:45.147 --> 30:47.236
very sensitive young man.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.456
- Okay.
- Yeah.

30:49.499 --> 30:52.676
By the way how is Ashley
adjusting to the move?

30:52.720 --> 30:53.764
She's good.

30:53.808 --> 30:56.028
You know, just a little bored.

30:56.071 --> 30:57.899
Oh.

30:57.943 --> 31:00.467
Well, you know, I don't
know if she'd be interested,

31:00.510 --> 31:02.164
but I could use a
little help around here

31:02.208 --> 31:04.688
if she's into like
maybe a part-time job.

31:04.732 --> 31:07.387
I'll ask her when
I get home tonight.

31:07.430 --> 31:09.563
Okay, great.
Yeah, call me let me know.

31:09.606 --> 31:10.694
All right.

31:10.738 --> 31:11.913
- Talk to you later.
- Okay.

31:11.957 --> 31:13.306
Bye.

31:15.743 --> 31:17.092
Thank you.
It was delicious.

31:17.136 --> 31:18.398
Oh, thanks so much.

31:18.441 --> 31:19.660
Have a great day.

31:29.365 --> 31:32.238
You scared me. Again.

31:32.281 --> 31:33.587
Told you I'm pretty sneaky.

31:33.630 --> 31:35.719
Hardware ninja.
I forgot.

31:35.763 --> 31:37.199
That's right.

31:37.243 --> 31:38.984
What can I get you?

31:39.027 --> 31:42.378
So I know I shouldn't
do this, but I just...

31:42.422 --> 31:43.727
I had to have one of your

31:43.771 --> 31:45.860
delicious treats
after my burger.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.123
Well, I have a really
great cake today.

31:48.167 --> 31:49.820
So, why don't you have a seat

31:49.864 --> 31:51.039
I'll bring you a slice over.

31:51.083 --> 31:52.823
Okie dokie.

32:16.630 --> 32:17.413
Enjoy.

32:17.457 --> 32:19.111
Thanks.

32:19.154 --> 32:21.461
Hey, you wanna join me?

32:23.071 --> 32:25.987
Uh, sorry, I'm kind
of busy right now.

32:26.031 --> 32:27.380
You aren't trying to
avoid me, are you?

32:28.903 --> 32:30.644
I guess, I can
spare a few minutes.

32:41.046 --> 32:44.571
Mmm, this cake is amazing.

32:48.575 --> 32:50.403
Listen.

32:50.446 --> 32:53.362
I know things been a bit
weird around here lately,

32:53.406 --> 32:57.888
but I want you to know I had
nothing to do with any of this.

32:59.673 --> 33:01.501
Any of what?

33:02.893 --> 33:04.112
Do I really have to say it?

33:05.461 --> 33:07.376
No.

33:07.420 --> 33:09.900
I know what you're
talking about.

33:09.944 --> 33:14.557
And, uh...
something else.

33:14.601 --> 33:16.603
What's that?

33:19.910 --> 33:23.827
I done a lot of work to
clear my name over the years.

33:23.871 --> 33:26.178
I tried really hard to
make up for my past,

33:26.221 --> 33:28.789
but I'm not perfect.

33:28.832 --> 33:30.312
- It's okay.
- No.

33:30.356 --> 33:31.574
Hear me out.

33:31.618 --> 33:33.924
Heather showed me
the headline.

33:37.667 --> 33:39.930
So you can understand
why I'm here then?

33:42.107 --> 33:46.067
People make it really
hard to start over.

33:46.111 --> 33:49.114
Everyone's runnin'
from something.

33:49.157 --> 33:52.073
Are we?

33:52.117 --> 33:55.555
My husband passed
away from cancer,

33:55.598 --> 33:58.601
and after that,

33:58.645 --> 34:01.082
I just couldn't
go back to my old life.

34:01.126 --> 34:03.650
Lena, I'm so sorry.

34:06.305 --> 34:08.350
I need to go back to work.

34:08.393 --> 34:09.917
Okay.

34:11.136 --> 34:12.789
Thanks again for the cake.

34:12.833 --> 34:14.835
You're welcome,
hardware ninja.

34:14.878 --> 34:16.097
Ah-ha.

34:25.628 --> 34:28.456
That's my dad and me
on a fishing trip.

34:29.850 --> 34:32.635
It was like a year
before he got sick.

34:36.422 --> 34:37.597
He looked really nice.

34:40.817 --> 34:42.167
He was.

34:46.127 --> 34:48.042
I wish my dad was nice.

34:50.175 --> 34:52.045
At least you have a dad.

34:58.661 --> 35:00.141
I don't.

35:06.974 --> 35:10.412
He walked out on us.

35:10.456 --> 35:12.501
One day he just went to
work and never came back.

35:16.679 --> 35:18.203
I'm so sorry.

35:28.038 --> 35:31.999
My mom says that he's got
this new family somewhere,

35:32.042 --> 35:33.914
but I wouldn't know.

35:39.006 --> 35:41.051
Maybe Michael can be
your new step-dad.

35:42.879 --> 35:45.143
You're hilarious, but...

35:45.186 --> 35:47.145
I don't think he likes
my mom like that.

35:49.843 --> 35:51.975
Do you trust him?

35:53.847 --> 35:55.283
What do you mean?

35:57.067 --> 35:58.678
I trust you.

36:00.245 --> 36:01.507
You do?

36:03.987 --> 36:05.946
I didn't say how much.

36:18.828 --> 36:20.395
How was your day?

36:34.235 --> 36:37.020
Mom, we weren't even
in my room.

36:38.674 --> 36:40.676
I didn't
just mean your room.

36:40.720 --> 36:44.289
I meant being alone
in the house at all.

36:44.332 --> 36:46.421
How was I supposed
to know that?

36:46.465 --> 36:47.944
You just were.

36:49.555 --> 36:51.252
That's such crap.

36:51.296 --> 36:53.602
Now you're just making the
rules up as you go along.

36:53.646 --> 36:57.432
I am not, and please don't
talk to me like that.

36:59.869 --> 37:03.525
You just don't know what it's
like for your dad to die.

37:03.569 --> 37:07.007
Like when people ask
about my parents,

37:07.050 --> 37:08.791
I try to avoid it.

37:08.835 --> 37:11.011
I just wanna say,
oh, my mom and me

37:11.054 --> 37:12.230
because it's easier to pretend

37:12.273 --> 37:15.015
that's it's always
been that way.

37:15.058 --> 37:17.278
And, guess what, Charlie
does the same thing.

37:19.019 --> 37:20.412
He's the only one
that understands

37:20.455 --> 37:22.022
what I'm going through.

37:32.946 --> 37:33.860
I'm sorry.

37:37.820 --> 37:39.300
I miss Dad too.

37:41.476 --> 37:43.957
I really, really miss him.

37:50.311 --> 37:52.574
Do you think it's ready yet?

37:52.618 --> 37:54.620
Let's check.

37:59.277 --> 38:02.671
I think, it needs
another couple minutes.

38:05.935 --> 38:08.634
Okay, I need you
to make a decision

38:08.677 --> 38:10.940
on this part-time job thing.

38:10.984 --> 38:14.988
Is it gonna be
Jenny's or Heather's?

38:16.424 --> 38:18.731
Jenny is Charlie's mom, right?

38:20.341 --> 38:22.256
Uh-huh.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.780
I think, I wanna work
at the yoga studio.

38:24.824 --> 38:26.695
Of course, you do.

38:28.131 --> 38:29.742
All right, I will
call Jenny tomorrow,

38:29.785 --> 38:32.353
and tell her you'll
stop by the studio.

38:35.138 --> 38:37.358
Finish the pasta
and the sauce.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.541
Michael, what are
you doing here?

38:46.585 --> 38:48.326
I realize that I did not

38:48.369 --> 38:51.764
properly welcome you
to town, so... welcome.

38:53.156 --> 38:55.333
Thank you, that's
awfully nice of you.

38:57.422 --> 39:00.033
So my daughter and I are
just getting ready to eat.

39:00.076 --> 39:02.601
Ooh, pasta.

39:04.820 --> 39:06.735
Mom, aren't you
gonna invite him in?

39:08.824 --> 39:10.086
Yeah.

39:10.130 --> 39:12.393
No, no, it's okay.
I was joking.

39:12.437 --> 39:14.439
You are more than welcome to.

39:14.482 --> 39:15.396
Really?

39:16.615 --> 39:17.746
Really.

39:23.709 --> 39:27.756
Hey, Casey, it's Heather.
No need to call me back.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.802
I'm in the boutique in case
the security company calls you.

39:31.020 --> 39:33.153
You don't have
cameras, do you?

39:35.155 --> 39:36.722
I hope you're alive.

39:39.986 --> 39:40.987
Bye.

39:43.163 --> 39:44.991
That's a lot of bleach.

40:02.704 --> 40:03.879
That's definitely blood.

40:07.622 --> 40:10.799
Jenny. Jenny, I need you at
the boutique right now.

40:12.758 --> 40:14.760
Plus he's really funny.

40:14.803 --> 40:17.240
That's really sweet.

40:17.284 --> 40:18.938
Isn't my mom the best?

40:18.981 --> 40:20.374
She certainly
sounds like it.

40:22.855 --> 40:25.988
Okay, we'll I've had
enough adult romance.

40:26.032 --> 40:27.120
Hey.

40:27.163 --> 40:28.121
I'm going to bed.

40:30.602 --> 40:31.429
Goodnight, honey.

40:34.649 --> 40:36.390
She seems like
such a great kid.

40:36.434 --> 40:37.652
She is.

40:39.872 --> 40:41.439
Can I ask you
something personal?

40:42.265 --> 40:43.179
Anything.

40:44.442 --> 40:45.573
About Beth?

40:47.749 --> 40:48.837
Beth.

40:51.797 --> 40:53.059
How did you guys meet?

40:56.236 --> 40:57.498
I like these.

40:58.630 --> 40:59.718
Okay, great.

40:59.761 --> 41:01.502
It's a nice spot you got here.

41:01.546 --> 41:04.418
Oh, thank you, thank you.
I'm pretty proud of my shop.

41:05.985 --> 41:08.074
Yeah, this town seems
like a perfect place

41:08.117 --> 41:10.206
to open my own
business finally.

41:12.295 --> 41:14.254
So hopefully business
will go well,

41:14.297 --> 41:15.821
and I don't know maybe
I'll settle down.

41:15.864 --> 41:17.562
I hope you do.

41:17.605 --> 41:20.303
And some of these.

41:25.221 --> 41:29.661
Great. Well, this is a
very nice array of blooms.

41:29.704 --> 41:32.359
I'm sure your wife
will be very happy.

41:32.402 --> 41:34.970
Yeah, they're for my mother.
It's her birthday.

41:35.014 --> 41:37.190
Oh, okay.

41:37.233 --> 41:38.626
Um, no wife.

41:38.670 --> 41:40.019
No wife.

41:40.062 --> 41:41.803
- Girlfriend?
- Mm-mmm.

41:41.847 --> 41:43.283
Oh, okay.

41:43.326 --> 41:46.025
Well, I'll just
go ring these up.

41:46.068 --> 41:47.374
All right.

41:48.636 --> 41:49.855
We were pretty serious.

41:49.898 --> 41:51.552
I asked her
to move in with me.

41:52.988 --> 41:54.860
What'd she say?

41:54.903 --> 41:56.339
That she'd think about it,

41:56.383 --> 41:57.993
and then she sent me a text

41:58.037 --> 41:59.865
saying that she's
leaving town one day.

41:59.908 --> 42:01.867
She sent you a text?

42:01.910 --> 42:03.651
She didn't do it in person?

42:03.695 --> 42:04.913
No.

42:07.568 --> 42:09.657
What do you think that is?

42:09.701 --> 42:11.877
I don't know.

42:11.920 --> 42:14.140
Maybe she dropped
a bottle of nail polish.

42:17.230 --> 42:18.971
When blood dries it
looks like that, right?

42:19.014 --> 42:20.886
Heather.

42:20.929 --> 42:22.975
- Really?
- Wait. You smell that?

42:23.018 --> 42:25.368
It smells like bleach.

42:25.412 --> 42:26.848
It does.

42:26.892 --> 42:28.023
Why would she need bleach?

42:28.067 --> 42:29.329
Honey, you're letting
your imagination

42:29.372 --> 42:31.810
run away with you again,
okay? Nobody is dead.

42:31.853 --> 42:33.333
I'm gonna call the cops.

42:33.376 --> 42:35.378
You're gonna call the
cops and tell them what?

42:35.422 --> 42:36.684
That Casey texted me,

42:36.728 --> 42:38.686
and told me
she's with her dad?

42:38.730 --> 42:41.733
And Beth, look I loved Beth
just like you loved Beth,

42:41.776 --> 42:45.911
but you remember her and she
was flaky and flighty.

42:45.954 --> 42:47.652
But don't you see
a pattern here?

42:49.784 --> 42:51.525
No, I don't.

42:51.569 --> 42:53.614
- I'm sorry.
- I don't see a pattern.

42:53.658 --> 42:56.269
But what I do see is
that you are sick,

42:56.312 --> 42:58.358
and you need to go home
and you need to get some rest.

43:00.447 --> 43:01.361
Right.

43:02.754 --> 43:04.146
Who's gonna find our friends?

43:04.190 --> 43:06.975
Heather, please, okay?
Go home.

43:07.019 --> 43:09.108
What's gonna happen if
you get too sick to work?

43:09.151 --> 43:11.937
You're pushing
yourself too hard.

43:11.980 --> 43:14.809
So please, for me,

43:14.853 --> 43:17.072
will you please go
home and get some rest?

43:18.726 --> 43:19.945
Okay.

43:19.988 --> 43:22.643
Okay, I'll bring you some soup.

43:22.687 --> 43:23.644
I don't like soup.

43:28.693 --> 43:31.609
Have you heard Heather's
conspiracy theory?

43:31.652 --> 43:33.306
Which one?

43:33.349 --> 43:35.525
That Beth was disappeared.

43:37.049 --> 43:38.746
She won't quit, will she?

43:38.790 --> 43:42.881
Can't people just stop
talking about her leaving?

43:42.924 --> 43:45.666
I mean, it's hard
enough to get by in life

43:45.710 --> 43:48.626
without being the subject
of town gossip, you know.

43:48.669 --> 43:50.540
It must be difficult.

43:55.154 --> 43:58.548
She did find your hammer
with your initials.

43:58.592 --> 44:00.638
It was a gift,
and I tossed it.

44:02.161 --> 44:04.511
I haven't looked back since.

44:05.599 --> 44:07.122
Just so you know,

44:07.166 --> 44:08.689
I don't believe the rumors.

44:08.733 --> 44:11.257
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

44:11.300 --> 44:12.824
Thanks, Lena.

44:12.867 --> 44:17.002
Well, at least
not most of them.

44:26.925 --> 44:29.449
So, jobs yours
if you want it.

44:29.492 --> 44:31.190
Thank you so much, yeah.

44:31.233 --> 44:33.714
When do you think
you might wanna start?

44:33.758 --> 44:35.237
How about right now?

44:35.281 --> 44:37.022
Okay, you think you're ready?

44:37.065 --> 44:38.719
I was born ready.

44:38.763 --> 44:42.070
I like it, that's
a good attitude.

44:42.114 --> 44:44.072
Alright, well, the cleaning
supplies are right here.

44:44.116 --> 44:47.423
- Okay.
- And I usually
start off by sweeping.

44:47.467 --> 44:50.078
- Okay.
- Yeah.

44:50.122 --> 44:53.125
So how's your mom doing?

44:53.168 --> 44:54.300
I mean,
is she adjusting okay?

44:54.343 --> 44:55.780
Everybody around here
has been

44:55.823 --> 44:57.651
you know, a little bit
on the edge lately.

44:57.695 --> 44:59.392
Yeah, I think, she's okay.

44:59.435 --> 45:01.220
She had a guy over
for dinner last night.

45:01.263 --> 45:03.831
It was nice to see her
smile like that again.

45:03.875 --> 45:06.791
She hadn't done that
since my dad was around.

45:06.834 --> 45:08.488
Who is the guy?

45:08.531 --> 45:11.012
It was weird he sort of
just showed up unannounced.

45:11.056 --> 45:12.927
It was the guy from
the hardware store.

45:12.971 --> 45:14.146
Michael.

45:14.189 --> 45:15.713
Mm-hmm, yeah.

45:15.756 --> 45:17.279
I think
they had a lot of fun.

45:27.681 --> 45:29.335
You look pretty cute
in that sweatshirt.

45:29.378 --> 45:31.206
Zip it up you'll be goth.

45:31.250 --> 45:32.947
You mean full goth?

45:32.991 --> 45:34.993
Well, I don't want
that, I guess.

45:35.036 --> 45:35.950
Probably take it off then.

45:41.303 --> 45:44.785
Um, thanks for lunch.

45:44.829 --> 45:46.787
I really appreciate that.

45:46.831 --> 45:48.006
Yeah.

45:48.963 --> 45:49.834
No problem, Charlie.

45:53.272 --> 45:55.491
Listen, Charlie.

45:55.535 --> 45:58.277
I know your mom's
not around much.

45:58.320 --> 46:01.584
She's doin' the best
to pay the bills.

46:01.628 --> 46:02.629
Yeah, she cares more about her

46:02.672 --> 46:04.152
stupid classes than me, but...

46:06.198 --> 46:08.504
The world can be a
tough place, Charlie,

46:08.548 --> 46:10.593
especially without
your parents around.

46:12.682 --> 46:14.946
You're a good kid,
you really are.

46:17.296 --> 46:19.515
You're the first person
to ever call me that.

46:21.648 --> 46:23.476
That feels weird.

46:23.519 --> 46:25.043
Well, you are.

46:28.046 --> 46:31.049
I want you to know if

46:31.092 --> 46:32.180
you ever wanna
talk about things

46:32.224 --> 46:35.618
or you ever need something,

46:35.662 --> 46:38.056
I'm gonna be around
for you, all right?

46:42.625 --> 46:44.627
Okay, it's gettin'
mushy now, so...

46:46.107 --> 46:47.630
Knock you out.

46:52.548 --> 46:53.462
Lena.

46:55.464 --> 46:57.162
You're tenacious,
aren't you?

46:57.205 --> 46:59.599
I don't know what that means.

46:59.642 --> 47:02.558
It means you don't
give a girl a break.

47:02.602 --> 47:04.430
Would you like to
have dinner with me

47:04.473 --> 47:06.606
just the two of us alone?

47:06.649 --> 47:08.869
- Oh.
- I realize this morning

47:08.913 --> 47:11.480
I just sort of invited myself
into your house last night.

47:11.524 --> 47:13.439
Could I make it up to
you by taking you out?

47:15.658 --> 47:18.357
Michael, I think you're
a really nice guy.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.011
I...

47:20.054 --> 47:22.317
I just don't know if I'm
ready for romance yet.

47:22.361 --> 47:25.320
You know, I'm just still
just trying to figure out

47:25.364 --> 47:28.367
what my life is,
and start over.

47:30.238 --> 47:32.066
Don't blame me for trying.

47:32.110 --> 47:33.285
If you change your mind,

47:33.328 --> 47:35.069
you know where to find me.

47:40.422 --> 47:41.902
I will go out with you.

47:43.904 --> 47:44.905
Really?

47:45.950 --> 47:48.996
Yes. It's been a year.

47:49.040 --> 47:50.911
I can go out on one date.

47:50.955 --> 47:53.392
Fantastic.

47:53.435 --> 47:54.306
I'll pick you up at eight.

47:58.919 --> 48:00.268
Okay.

48:08.537 --> 48:10.583
Hey, Heather.

48:10.626 --> 48:12.019
Hey, I'm just finishing up.

48:12.063 --> 48:13.455
Do you want some tea?

48:13.499 --> 48:15.283
Yeah, your icy
looks really good.

48:15.327 --> 48:17.372
- Sure.
- Thanks.

48:17.416 --> 48:20.810
So, how's the detective
business going?

48:23.857 --> 48:27.034
Well, I am piecing
it all together.

48:27.078 --> 48:28.296
Oh, yeah?

48:30.385 --> 48:31.560
Yeah.

48:31.604 --> 48:32.561
Here.

48:32.605 --> 48:33.606
Thanks.

48:35.434 --> 48:38.219
Okay, so Beth
decided to stay,

48:38.263 --> 48:40.569
and someone
killed her for it,

48:40.613 --> 48:41.962
and then someone
didn't like that

48:42.006 --> 48:43.703
Casey and Michael
were getting so close,

48:43.746 --> 48:45.226
and now Casey's gone.

48:45.270 --> 48:47.098
But you said yourself
that Casey and Michael

48:47.141 --> 48:48.838
were just friends, right?

48:48.882 --> 48:50.579
And that Casey didn't
even like him that way.

48:50.623 --> 48:52.451
So that theory is no good.

48:52.494 --> 48:54.279
You were close
with both of them.

48:54.322 --> 48:56.324
Did they ever tell
you anything about

48:56.368 --> 48:59.240
feeling threatened
or in danger or?

48:59.284 --> 49:00.676
No, never.

49:03.505 --> 49:05.333
You're not interested
in Michael, are you?

49:05.377 --> 49:06.682
Heather, listen.

49:06.726 --> 49:08.293
You should really
just leave this alone

49:08.336 --> 49:09.859
you know, before you get hurt.

49:09.903 --> 49:12.427
Get hurt?
What do you know that I don't?

49:12.471 --> 49:14.690
Okay, see this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

49:14.734 --> 49:16.257
You're going over the edge.

49:16.301 --> 49:18.433
- Jenny, I'm fine.
- No, you're not!

49:18.477 --> 49:20.044
Your behavior is
borderline psychotic!

49:20.087 --> 49:23.395
I don't appreciate
the way you're talking to me.

49:23.438 --> 49:25.005
Well, I'm sorry,
it's the truth.

49:25.049 --> 49:26.398
Okay, you're on some crusade

49:26.441 --> 49:28.226
strictly for your
own entertainment,

49:28.269 --> 49:29.531
and you're ruining someone's
life in the process.

49:29.575 --> 49:31.055
You don't even seem to care.

49:31.098 --> 49:32.491
You're a
coffee shop owner, okay?

49:32.534 --> 49:34.014
You're not a detective.

49:34.058 --> 49:36.190
And, frankly, you're
embarrassing yourself.

49:36.234 --> 49:37.713
You're embarrassing
your friends.

49:44.546 --> 49:46.461
Jenny, I'm just trying
to find our friends.

49:46.505 --> 49:49.725
- Okay, I'm trying to figure--
- Okay, okay, okay.

49:51.075 --> 49:52.554
I didn't mean that.

49:55.209 --> 49:58.212
I'm sorry. Okay?

49:58.256 --> 50:01.955
Just... just drop it.

50:04.784 --> 50:06.351
No promises.

51:25.821 --> 51:27.823
That should do it.

51:43.230 --> 51:45.014
Help me!

51:46.103 --> 51:47.147
Help me!

51:48.366 --> 51:49.497
Help!

51:50.585 --> 51:52.109
Help!

51:54.894 --> 51:56.765
Oh, God!

52:48.121 --> 52:49.427
Are you nervous?

52:50.558 --> 52:51.559
A little.

52:53.648 --> 52:55.215
All right,
I'm really nervous.

52:55.259 --> 52:57.217
Do you think he
changed his mind?

52:57.261 --> 52:59.437
No, trust me he likes you.

53:17.672 --> 53:19.674
For you.

53:19.718 --> 53:21.067
Thank you.

53:21.110 --> 53:22.460
You're welcome.

53:24.462 --> 53:25.985
Is this too dressy?

53:26.028 --> 53:27.204
Should I change?

53:27.247 --> 53:29.989
You look amazing, really.

53:30.032 --> 53:31.904
- Thank you.
- Of course.

53:33.166 --> 53:35.299
Oh. Sorry, I totally forgot

53:35.342 --> 53:36.865
that I already
brought you some,

53:36.909 --> 53:39.041
but that's what you're
supposed to do, right?

53:39.085 --> 53:39.999
That's okay, thank you.

53:40.042 --> 53:41.566
Sorry I'm late.

53:41.609 --> 53:44.699
Are you okay you're
a little flustered?

53:44.743 --> 53:47.659
No, I just had a customer
show up to the shop.

53:47.702 --> 53:48.616
Gave me hell.

53:48.660 --> 53:50.531
I know how that is.

53:52.577 --> 53:53.752
- Should we go?
- Yeah.

53:53.795 --> 53:55.667
Have her home by
midnight, please?

53:55.710 --> 53:57.495
- Yes, ma'am.
- You have fun.

53:57.538 --> 53:59.584
Pizza's in the fridge.

53:59.627 --> 54:00.585
And remember--

54:00.628 --> 54:01.803
I know.
No house guests.

54:01.847 --> 54:04.153
- Thank you.
- Shall we?

54:04.197 --> 54:05.024
After you.

54:08.767 --> 54:09.811
Bye, Ash.

54:13.206 --> 54:16.949
I have never had pulled
pork like that in my life.

54:16.992 --> 54:18.733
Pretty amazing, isn't it?

54:18.777 --> 54:21.301
Words cannot describe.

54:26.088 --> 54:27.568
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- No.

54:27.612 --> 54:29.440
I'm sorry.

54:29.483 --> 54:31.006
It's me.

54:31.050 --> 54:34.575
I'm just--
I'm not used to that.

54:34.619 --> 54:36.969
It's gonna take me a little
bit to get to the hand thing.

54:37.012 --> 54:39.667
It's truly no
problem, all right?

54:39.711 --> 54:43.323
Again, it's okay.

54:51.984 --> 54:54.769
You're a really good
mother you know that?

54:54.813 --> 54:56.597
Not a lot people who
could've gone through

54:56.641 --> 54:59.383
what you went through and
stayed as strong as you have.

55:00.949 --> 55:03.952
Sometimes I feel like
I'm the teenager.

55:03.996 --> 55:06.390
She's the one who pushed
me to go out tonight.

55:06.433 --> 55:07.956
Do you mean somebody
had to push you?

55:08.000 --> 55:10.176
My rugged charm
wasn't enough for you?

55:10.219 --> 55:12.961
No, I don't
mean it like that.

55:13.005 --> 55:15.660
Maybe she can push you into
seeing a movie tomorrow.

55:15.703 --> 55:18.619
They got some Chevy Chase movies
going on at the Four Plex.

55:18.663 --> 55:19.664
- No.
- Yeah.

55:19.707 --> 55:21.622
It's only 10 miles from here.

55:22.841 --> 55:24.059
I'd love to.

55:24.103 --> 55:26.453
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

55:26.497 --> 55:27.846
Awesome.

55:29.195 --> 55:31.719
They got Twizzlers,
your favorite.

55:32.894 --> 55:34.592
How can I say no?

55:59.225 --> 56:00.879
Hey, Lena,

56:00.922 --> 56:02.097
you haven't seen
Heather, have you?

56:02.141 --> 56:03.708
No, isn't the shop open?

56:03.751 --> 56:06.711
We've been waiting
here for a half hour.

56:08.930 --> 56:10.279
I have some tea
over at my place

56:10.323 --> 56:12.020
if you guys are interested?

56:12.064 --> 56:13.500
Yeah, that'd be great.

56:13.544 --> 56:14.719
Alright, I'll meet
you guys over there.

56:14.762 --> 56:16.068
You're welcome.

56:17.374 --> 56:18.766
You're welcome.

56:38.220 --> 56:41.615
Lena, you got anymore
of those butter cookies?

56:41.659 --> 56:44.357
I have a fresh batch resting
right behind the counter.

56:44.401 --> 56:45.402
Cool.

56:45.445 --> 56:46.794
All right, let's go.

56:55.977 --> 56:58.153
I think, I'm finished
with the floors.

56:58.197 --> 56:59.677
- Oh.
- Do they look okay?

57:02.288 --> 57:04.943
Uh, let's take a look.

57:04.986 --> 57:07.772
Yeah, great.
Great work.

57:07.815 --> 57:09.469
So now you can
just take this

57:09.513 --> 57:11.602
and put it back in that
storeroom that I showed you.

57:11.645 --> 57:13.255
And then we've got
a couple of minutes,

57:13.299 --> 57:15.997
so come on back and we
can take a break and chat.

58:33.988 --> 58:35.381
Is there anything else
I can do?

58:35.424 --> 58:37.339
Nope, not right now, honey.

58:37.383 --> 58:39.733
When Michael gets here,
I can show you how to

58:39.777 --> 58:41.256
check students
into the computer.

58:43.345 --> 58:45.609
What'd you and your
mom do last night?

58:45.652 --> 58:46.914
Nothing.

58:46.958 --> 58:48.568
I ate pizza
and watched a movie.

58:48.612 --> 58:49.656
She went out.

58:49.700 --> 58:51.223
Wow, busy lady.

58:51.266 --> 58:52.659
Yeah. Out with who?

58:52.703 --> 58:55.009
Michael.

58:55.053 --> 58:56.968
- Again.
- Mm-hmm

58:57.011 --> 58:59.144
Those rumors about
him they don't...

58:59.187 --> 59:00.667
they don't bother you?

59:00.711 --> 59:02.713
- Not really.
- No?

59:02.756 --> 59:04.671
My dad always said
that talk is cheap.

59:04.715 --> 59:07.021
I'm just glad that she's
finally getting out.

59:07.065 --> 59:08.893
She says that
they're just friends,

59:08.936 --> 59:10.982
but I can tell
that he likes her.

59:12.505 --> 59:14.333
Is she serious about him?

59:14.376 --> 59:15.595
I don't know.

59:15.639 --> 59:16.944
I mean, she's not
a casual dater

59:16.988 --> 59:19.164
even before she met my dad.

59:19.207 --> 59:20.208
They always said that she was

59:20.252 --> 59:21.732
the hardest lady to date in LA,

59:21.775 --> 59:23.690
and then he convinced her
to go on a first date,

59:23.734 --> 59:25.953
and the rest is history.

59:27.564 --> 59:28.956
Hey, mom.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.741
- Hi, monkey.
- Hi.

59:30.784 --> 59:34.048
What time does Ashley get off?

59:34.092 --> 59:36.355
How about, uh--
How about now?

59:36.398 --> 59:37.617
Really.

59:37.661 --> 59:39.227
Yeah, you guys,
you go ahead you go

59:39.271 --> 59:40.359
and enjoy the sunshine.

59:40.402 --> 59:41.752
- Cool.
- Yeah.

59:41.795 --> 59:43.057
- Thanks.
- Hmm-mm.

59:43.101 --> 59:44.450
Namaste, Ashley.

59:58.551 --> 01:00:00.118
Hey, Jenny.

01:00:00.161 --> 01:00:02.381
Everything okay at the studio?

01:00:02.424 --> 01:00:05.732
Yeah, I just figured I'd
pop by and say hello.

01:00:05.776 --> 01:00:07.560
What's that?

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:10.737
I found them out back
in the parking lot.

01:00:10.781 --> 01:00:13.174
Do you recognize them?

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:17.962
No, should I?

01:00:18.005 --> 01:00:19.616
Look at the coffee cup.

01:00:19.659 --> 01:00:22.706
I think they're Heather's.

01:00:22.749 --> 01:00:24.403
Hmm.

01:00:26.666 --> 01:00:29.060
So how long have
you been dating Michael?

01:00:30.931 --> 01:00:33.020
I wouldn't say
that we're dating.

01:00:33.064 --> 01:00:35.501
So you just slept with him?

01:00:35.544 --> 01:00:38.417
Jenny, that's not really
any of your business.

01:00:39.723 --> 01:00:41.507
Are you gonna see him again?

01:00:43.204 --> 01:00:45.076
I mean we were planning on
going to a movie tonight,

01:00:45.119 --> 01:00:46.599
but now...

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:49.167
I don't know, I think
I'm just gonna cancel.

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:51.909
That's good.

01:00:51.952 --> 01:00:53.780
Good.

01:00:53.824 --> 01:00:56.174
I mean, he's not really
your type anyway, is he?

01:00:58.350 --> 01:01:01.440
I mean, how would you
know what my type is?

01:01:01.483 --> 01:01:03.094
Because I know your kind.

01:01:03.137 --> 01:01:06.271
- My kind?
- Yeah.

01:01:06.314 --> 01:01:08.490
Yeah, you breeze
in from a big city

01:01:08.534 --> 01:01:11.450
like some wounded bird
to a small town

01:01:11.493 --> 01:01:13.539
looking for people
to help you.

01:01:13.582 --> 01:01:15.715
Is that right?

01:01:15.759 --> 01:01:18.283
I figured I would just come by

01:01:18.326 --> 01:01:20.285
and give you a little
friendly advice.

01:01:21.503 --> 01:01:22.896
He's not yours.

01:01:25.507 --> 01:01:28.206
You should just
stay away from him.

01:01:30.948 --> 01:01:33.733
Did you hear me?

01:01:33.777 --> 01:01:35.692
I hear you.

01:01:35.735 --> 01:01:37.606
That's real good.

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:41.654
I'm gonna
give these to Heather.

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:45.310
And you,
you should probably just

01:01:45.353 --> 01:01:47.312
go back to wherever
you came from.

01:01:51.533 --> 01:01:54.972
You know, I'm fine
right where I am.

01:01:55.015 --> 01:01:56.713
Not for long.

01:02:10.422 --> 01:02:11.989
Lena.

01:02:13.338 --> 01:02:14.295
Oh, my God!

01:02:16.558 --> 01:02:19.344
I haven't been hit that
hard since the ring.

01:02:19.387 --> 01:02:21.781
Good shot.

01:02:21.825 --> 01:02:23.740
You're lucky
that's all you got.

01:02:36.491 --> 01:02:38.189
Thanks.

01:02:40.582 --> 01:02:43.324
So, what's the deal
with you and Jenny?

01:02:43.368 --> 01:02:44.673
I'm not sure what you mean.

01:02:44.717 --> 01:02:46.850
She came over here
today on a rampage.

01:02:46.893 --> 01:02:47.938
She's just a friend.

01:02:47.981 --> 01:02:48.895
A friend that gives you

01:02:48.939 --> 01:02:49.896
private yoga lessons.

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:51.115
She likes to do that

01:02:51.158 --> 01:02:52.377
because I gave her son a job

01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:54.205
just repaying a
favor sort of thing.

01:02:54.248 --> 01:02:57.730
That's right, you also
work with her son.

01:02:57.774 --> 01:02:59.950
You know, I am not
one of these girls

01:02:59.993 --> 01:03:01.734
that you could just gaslight.

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:04.519
I swear, Lena,
nothing's going on.

01:03:04.563 --> 01:03:06.347
You're the only
one I care about.

01:03:06.391 --> 01:03:08.828
Well, tell that to Jenny.

01:03:08.872 --> 01:03:12.179
'Cause I'm done.
We're done.

01:03:12.223 --> 01:03:13.528
You can find
some other girl--

01:03:13.572 --> 01:03:15.095
Come on, Lena,
don't be like that.

01:03:15.139 --> 01:03:17.794
You know, I'm not
feeling very well.

01:03:17.837 --> 01:03:19.839
- I can't make it tonight.
- That's okay.

01:03:19.883 --> 01:03:21.014
Don't.

01:03:22.711 --> 01:03:23.843
Don't touch me.

01:03:23.887 --> 01:03:25.236
Lena.

01:03:27.629 --> 01:03:29.109
You know, I think,
you should go.

01:03:33.287 --> 01:03:34.201
Okay.

01:03:50.696 --> 01:03:53.046
Your legs they look
good in the water.

01:03:55.962 --> 01:03:57.442
They only look
good in the water.

01:03:57.485 --> 01:03:58.878
I mean, they look good
outside of the water,

01:03:58.922 --> 01:04:01.489
but they look good
in the water.

01:04:01.533 --> 01:04:03.361
I'll take it.

01:04:03.404 --> 01:04:07.669
Okay. Good, just take it
and run with it, please.

01:04:07.713 --> 01:04:08.888
Yep.

01:04:10.063 --> 01:04:11.021
My gosh.

01:04:14.067 --> 01:04:15.808
Oh, one sec, it's my mom.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:17.854
Wow, that's a pretty
old school ring.

01:04:20.334 --> 01:04:21.248
Hi.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:24.512
Where are you?

01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:26.863
Charlie's.

01:04:28.647 --> 01:04:30.910
Look do me a favor
and go home.

01:04:30.954 --> 01:04:32.564
I'll be there soon.

01:04:34.218 --> 01:04:36.307
Come on, mom, we're
not even inside.

01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:38.657
Ashley, just go home, please.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:39.876
I don't wanna hear it.

01:04:41.225 --> 01:04:42.661
Fine.

01:04:46.143 --> 01:04:47.361
This is so annoying.

01:04:47.405 --> 01:04:48.754
You okay?

01:04:48.797 --> 01:04:50.234
Yeah, nothing.

01:04:52.366 --> 01:04:54.368
You know, you can tell
me anything, right?

01:04:54.412 --> 01:04:56.501
I know.

01:04:56.544 --> 01:04:57.763
Thanks.

01:04:59.983 --> 01:05:01.462
That's good.

01:05:07.207 --> 01:05:08.861
Okay.

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:10.950
We're gonna do one
more deep breath.

01:05:13.953 --> 01:05:15.999
Really get a good stretch.

01:05:22.048 --> 01:05:22.962
Yeah.

01:05:25.965 --> 01:05:29.403
And now we're gonna
settle into...

01:05:29.447 --> 01:05:32.189
Shavasana.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:39.848
Okay.

01:05:42.851 --> 01:05:43.940
Yeah.

01:05:46.638 --> 01:05:48.292
That's real good.

01:05:56.082 --> 01:06:00.260
You know, I think, Charlie's
always secretly hoped

01:06:00.304 --> 01:06:02.436
that you and I
would get together.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:03.524
Really?

01:06:03.568 --> 01:06:04.961
Yeah.

01:06:12.838 --> 01:06:16.537
I just think he really
admires you, you know.

01:06:19.323 --> 01:06:22.979
I even think that he
got a little angry

01:06:23.022 --> 01:06:25.546
when he thought you
were dating Casey.

01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:27.374
Casey's just a friend.

01:06:27.418 --> 01:06:31.770
I'm glad he doesn't think I'm
Ted Bundy like everyone else.

01:06:31.813 --> 01:06:34.555
I know you could
never hurt anybody.

01:06:34.599 --> 01:06:36.818
Yeah.

01:06:36.862 --> 01:06:37.863
Well, I have.

01:06:39.952 --> 01:06:41.258
Do you wanna talk about it?

01:06:41.301 --> 01:06:45.218
No.
Definitely not.

01:06:46.828 --> 01:06:48.395
It's just that, you know,

01:06:48.439 --> 01:06:51.877
I mean, if there's ever
anything that I can do...

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:55.446
I mean you've been such a
great father figure to Charlie.

01:06:57.274 --> 01:06:59.754
I mean, you know that his dad
isn't in our lives anymore.

01:06:59.798 --> 01:07:02.105
I know.
That's so bad for Charlie.

01:07:02.148 --> 01:07:04.759
Every kid needs a father.

01:07:04.803 --> 01:07:06.979
I just...

01:07:07.023 --> 01:07:09.590
I don't know what we
would do without you.

01:07:11.853 --> 01:07:15.031
I'm not going anywhere.
Okay?

01:07:18.773 --> 01:07:20.253
What a gentleman.

01:07:21.994 --> 01:07:23.691
So same time tomorrow?

01:07:23.735 --> 01:07:27.391
- Yes, ma'am.
- Great.

01:07:27.434 --> 01:07:30.350
Hey, are you sure I can't
pay you for the class?

01:07:30.394 --> 01:07:32.483
Oh, no, no, I can't
take your money

01:07:32.526 --> 01:07:35.007
not after everything you've
done for Charlie and me.

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:36.487
Thanks, Jenny.

01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:38.097
Let me know if you
change your mind.

01:07:38.141 --> 01:07:40.665
In the meantime if you need
any hardware solutions,

01:07:40.708 --> 01:07:42.493
I'm your guy.

01:07:42.536 --> 01:07:43.798
Yes, you are.

01:07:50.675 --> 01:07:52.198
There it is.

01:07:52.242 --> 01:07:54.548
How's it going at
the hardware store.

01:07:54.592 --> 01:07:56.550
You know, it's pretty slow.

01:07:56.594 --> 01:07:59.423
Is Michael still
trying to be your dad?

01:07:59.466 --> 01:08:00.685
What's your deal with him?

01:08:00.728 --> 01:08:01.947
What do you mean?

01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:04.123
I mean, you don't
seem to like him much.

01:08:04.167 --> 01:08:06.691
I like that
he's into my mom.

01:08:06.734 --> 01:08:08.867
But I have a bad
feeling about him.

01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:10.564
All the women in this town
are obsessed with him.

01:08:10.608 --> 01:08:11.783
Yeah, my mom included.

01:08:11.826 --> 01:08:13.132
Really.

01:08:13.176 --> 01:08:15.569
It's annoying, and
it's embarrassing.

01:08:15.613 --> 01:08:17.005
She's always texting him

01:08:17.049 --> 01:08:18.224
and giving him these
free yoga lessons.

01:08:18.268 --> 01:08:20.270
Oh, no.

01:08:20.313 --> 01:08:22.140
What? What's wrong?

01:08:22.185 --> 01:08:24.796
I told her that my mom and
Michael went on a date.

01:08:24.839 --> 01:08:26.145
- Really.
- Yeah.

01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:27.407
And now I feel like a jerk.

01:08:27.451 --> 01:08:30.410
I'm sure it's not
a big deal, so...

01:08:31.759 --> 01:08:33.979
Did you know that
he killed someone?

01:08:35.502 --> 01:08:37.635
Yeah.
Yeah, he told me.

01:08:37.678 --> 01:08:39.158
It's why he moved here.

01:08:39.202 --> 01:08:41.639
Wow, okay, so it is true.

01:08:41.682 --> 01:08:45.381
Apparently, he just hit
someone so hard he died.

01:08:45.425 --> 01:08:46.731
But it was in the
boxing ring, so...

01:08:46.774 --> 01:08:49.167
Yeah, but that's
like really strong.

01:08:49.212 --> 01:08:51.038
It's a hazard of the job.

01:08:51.082 --> 01:08:52.301
I don't know what to say.

01:08:52.345 --> 01:08:54.260
Probably has a temper.

01:08:54.304 --> 01:08:55.740
I don't think so.

01:08:55.783 --> 01:08:58.220
I mean, I work with him,
and he seems pretty nice.

01:08:58.264 --> 01:08:59.657
Or is he
hiding something?

01:09:38.216 --> 01:09:40.219
Heather!

01:09:40.263 --> 01:09:42.134
It's Lena!

01:10:15.385 --> 01:10:17.648
Heather.

01:10:25.569 --> 01:10:27.440
You here?

01:11:00.125 --> 01:11:02.040
So you're telling me
that you just decided

01:11:02.083 --> 01:11:04.608
to break into your
new friend's house.

01:11:04.651 --> 01:11:05.913
I didn't break in.

01:11:05.957 --> 01:11:07.698
I used the key under the mat.

01:11:07.741 --> 01:11:09.569
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Is this your house?

01:11:09.613 --> 01:11:11.049
No, but I didn't break in.

01:11:11.092 --> 01:11:12.746
Did Heather instruct
you to use the key

01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:14.531
and open the door?

01:11:14.574 --> 01:11:15.619
No.

01:11:15.662 --> 01:11:17.882
Honey, you broke in.

01:11:17.925 --> 01:11:19.971
She didn't show up to
her coffee shop today,

01:11:20.014 --> 01:11:22.669
and I found her keys in the
alley next to the dumpster.

01:11:22.713 --> 01:11:24.715
Well, don't tell me that.
You're digging a deeper
hole for yourself.

01:11:24.758 --> 01:11:26.673
You just told me you
found them under the mat.

01:11:26.717 --> 01:11:31.112
That florist just
disappeared over a year ago.

01:11:31.156 --> 01:11:34.028
And then Casey just up
and leaves a few days ago.

01:11:34.072 --> 01:11:36.422
Heather was worried
that something happened
to both of them,

01:11:36.466 --> 01:11:38.163
and now she's gone too.

01:11:38.206 --> 01:11:40.078
Jesus Christ, you're starting
to sound just like Heather.

01:11:40.121 --> 01:11:41.384
You can't let that
woman get to you.

01:11:41.427 --> 01:11:42.559
She's paranoid.

01:11:42.602 --> 01:11:44.082
I thought she was paranoid too.

01:11:44.125 --> 01:11:45.866
But maybe she's onto something.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:51.089
Listen, Jenny came
storming into my shop today

01:11:51.132 --> 01:11:53.091
threatened me,
and took Heather's keys.

01:11:53.134 --> 01:11:54.832
I've known Jenny
her whole life.

01:11:54.875 --> 01:11:57.051
She ain't the sort.

01:11:57.095 --> 01:11:59.053
Did you reach out to Heather?

01:11:59.097 --> 01:12:01.099
I can't get her on the phone.

01:12:01.142 --> 01:12:02.796
But she texted me.

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.363
Well, if she contacted you,

01:12:04.407 --> 01:12:05.756
why are you trying to make
me think she's missing?

01:12:05.799 --> 01:12:08.411
Well, if she's sick,
why isn't she at home?

01:12:08.454 --> 01:12:11.370
Listen, there is
something wrong here.

01:12:12.589 --> 01:12:15.200
Please just do your job.

01:12:17.594 --> 01:12:19.552
Don't disrespect me, Lena.

01:12:19.596 --> 01:12:21.380
I'm the law in this town.

01:12:21.424 --> 01:12:23.643
Look, I know you're new here,

01:12:23.687 --> 01:12:24.992
all right, so I'm
gonna give you a pass.

01:12:25.036 --> 01:12:26.559
Better yet,
this is what I'll do.

01:12:26.603 --> 01:12:28.692
I'll do some
snooping around town.

01:12:28.735 --> 01:12:31.347
Okay, but if I find out
that everything is in order,

01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:33.740
you just gotta stop this
fantasy it's ridiculous.

01:12:33.784 --> 01:12:35.176
You're sounding like Heather.

01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:37.353
I promise, I will.

01:12:37.396 --> 01:12:39.746
Good.
And no more breaking into

01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:41.313
your friend's houses, alright?

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:42.880
Deal.

01:12:44.142 --> 01:12:45.361
See you soon.

01:12:45.404 --> 01:12:46.927
All right.

01:13:33.191 --> 01:13:34.105
Ashley.

01:13:42.896 --> 01:13:44.507
Ashley, you here?

01:13:52.079 --> 01:13:53.994
Ash?

01:14:00.784 --> 01:14:02.263
Ashley, you here?

01:14:02.307 --> 01:14:03.351
You here?

01:14:28.594 --> 01:14:29.682
Hello.

01:14:38.386 --> 01:14:39.344
Anyone home?

01:15:12.856 --> 01:15:14.814
Jenny.

01:15:14.858 --> 01:15:16.555
Do you always break into
your neighbor's home?

01:15:16.599 --> 01:15:18.252
The door was open.

01:15:18.296 --> 01:15:19.993
I need to speak with Ashley.

01:15:21.821 --> 01:15:22.735
Yeah, sure, she's
in the backyard.

01:15:22.779 --> 01:15:23.910
Come on it's this way.

01:15:28.741 --> 01:15:30.613
I was gonna have
a glass of wine.
Do you want one?

01:15:30.656 --> 01:15:32.266
No.

01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:34.181
Thanks for letting
Ashley stay here.

01:15:34.225 --> 01:15:36.096
Oh, of course. By the way
I was gonna tell you.

01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:38.403
I saw Heather and she's fine.

01:15:38.446 --> 01:15:39.665
You saw her?

01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:42.233
Well, I mean,
I talked to her.

01:15:42.276 --> 01:15:43.495
On the phone?

01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:46.629
Yeah. Yeah, why?

01:15:46.672 --> 01:15:48.108
Did she say where she is?

01:15:48.152 --> 01:15:52.025
She's gonna stay with her
aunt for a little while.

01:15:52.069 --> 01:15:53.549
That cold
that she has, I guess,

01:15:53.592 --> 01:15:55.725
it's taken a really
bad turn to the flu.

01:15:57.422 --> 01:15:58.466
That's what Hank thought.

01:15:58.510 --> 01:16:00.207
Did you go to the police?

01:16:00.251 --> 01:16:03.471
No, but the old drunk
almost arrested me.

01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:08.999
Hey, Mrs. Mitchell.

01:16:09.042 --> 01:16:10.261
Charlie.

01:16:10.304 --> 01:16:11.741
Mom, can we stay for dinner?

01:16:11.784 --> 01:16:13.351
Ashley, I told you to go home.

01:16:13.394 --> 01:16:14.526
Well, I was going to,

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:15.701
but then you came here first.

01:16:19.705 --> 01:16:22.534
Why don't we just let the
kids play for a while.

01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:24.580
Besides there's
something I'd really like

01:16:24.623 --> 01:16:25.493
to talk to you about.

01:16:27.887 --> 01:16:29.106
Go home, Ashley.

01:16:29.149 --> 01:16:30.977
Please, can I stay?

01:16:31.021 --> 01:16:32.631
- No.
- I'm not leaving.

01:16:32.675 --> 01:16:34.372
You are being so unfair.

01:16:38.376 --> 01:16:39.551
Ashley. Ash.

01:16:43.686 --> 01:16:45.644
She doesn't even care
about what I want.

01:16:45.688 --> 01:16:48.125
This whole move has
just been for her.

01:16:49.213 --> 01:16:51.432
I'm sorry.

01:16:51.476 --> 01:16:53.652
I'm sorry, okay.

01:16:55.393 --> 01:16:57.351
Mikey, Mikey, Mikey.

01:16:57.395 --> 01:16:58.352
How you doin'?

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:03.314
Hey, Hank.

01:17:03.357 --> 01:17:04.794
Good to see you buddy.

01:17:04.837 --> 01:17:06.230
I'm glad you're open late.

01:17:06.273 --> 01:17:08.449
Ready to throw back
a few, huh?

01:17:08.493 --> 01:17:11.539
More ready than you
can possibly imagine.

01:17:12.671 --> 01:17:13.933
Hmm-mm.

01:17:13.977 --> 01:17:15.892
Boy, have I had a day.

01:17:15.935 --> 01:17:18.372
You wouldn't believe
me if I told you.

01:17:18.416 --> 01:17:20.810
I'm sorry I asked.
Then don't tell me.

01:17:20.853 --> 01:17:23.290
Okay. I won't.

01:17:23.334 --> 01:17:25.205
You guys having some
trouble at home?

01:17:25.249 --> 01:17:27.555
Just normal kids stuff.

01:17:29.035 --> 01:17:30.646
Can I use your restroom?

01:17:30.689 --> 01:17:32.560
Yeah, of course.

01:17:32.604 --> 01:17:34.040
If you go right
around that corner,

01:17:34.084 --> 01:17:35.346
it's the first
door on the right.

01:17:44.094 --> 01:17:45.835
I ever tell you
about that time

01:17:45.878 --> 01:17:47.575
I took down a stag
with my bare hands?

01:17:47.619 --> 01:17:49.055
Yeah, I say I heard that

01:17:49.099 --> 01:17:50.796
about six or seven times,
give or take a couple.

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:52.711
Yeah, but I found the
soft spot in the skull.

01:17:52.755 --> 01:17:55.018
I know the story well.

01:18:01.372 --> 01:18:02.808
What the hell
happened to your lip?

01:18:05.289 --> 01:18:07.508
Lena hit me with a broom.

01:18:08.466 --> 01:18:10.163
These girls are nuts.

01:18:10.207 --> 01:18:12.165
I swear, Hank,

01:18:12.209 --> 01:18:14.254
I really thought we had
something good going, man.

01:18:14.298 --> 01:18:17.040
Till the broom hit you in the
face and told you otherwise.

01:18:17.083 --> 01:18:19.564
Yeah, I don't buy it, man.

01:18:51.248 --> 01:18:53.598
What the...

01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:10.615
What am I doing?

01:19:13.661 --> 01:19:16.534
Is everything okay?

01:19:16.577 --> 01:19:19.537
Yeah, just knocked
something over.

01:19:20.451 --> 01:19:21.713
Okay.

01:19:24.150 --> 01:19:27.327
Well, come on in here.
I, uh...

01:19:27.371 --> 01:19:28.589
I wanna get to the girl talk.

01:19:28.633 --> 01:19:30.766
Yeah, sure.

01:20:05.975 --> 01:20:08.194
Come, sit.

01:20:11.894 --> 01:20:14.548
So how did your date
with Michael go?

01:20:16.289 --> 01:20:17.813
What date?

01:20:17.856 --> 01:20:19.510
Don't be coy.

01:20:19.553 --> 01:20:23.601
I meant it when I said I was
sorry about the other day.

01:20:23.644 --> 01:20:26.996
I was... I was
overprotective of a friend.

01:20:27.039 --> 01:20:29.868
I'd really like
to make amends.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.567
To a fresh start.

01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:45.536
Oh, it must be cork.

01:20:45.579 --> 01:20:48.452
It's fine.
It's really very good.

01:20:51.368 --> 01:20:53.196
So what'd you
do on your date?

01:20:55.763 --> 01:20:57.026
You know, it's getting late.

01:20:57.069 --> 01:20:58.244
I think, we should be going.

01:20:58.288 --> 01:21:00.899
No, no, no, no,
let the kids play.

01:21:02.945 --> 01:21:04.772
Did Michael kiss you?

01:21:07.036 --> 01:21:09.473
I'm sorry, I have to take
care of something real fast.

01:21:09.516 --> 01:21:11.431
Sure.

01:21:11.475 --> 01:21:13.042
You know,
I was really surprised

01:21:13.085 --> 01:21:15.174
that you agreed to go out
with him to begin with,

01:21:15.218 --> 01:21:17.263
considering what Heather
told you about him.

01:21:20.745 --> 01:21:22.747
Did you guys
get to first base?

01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:25.315
I'll tell you about
that another time.

01:21:40.069 --> 01:21:42.114
You're not going anywhere.

01:21:43.768 --> 01:21:49.643
If you run, I will
gut your daughter.

01:21:51.167 --> 01:21:54.213
We should go fishing
next week, you know.

01:21:54.257 --> 01:21:56.259
Have some beers,
smoke a cigar.

01:21:56.302 --> 01:22:00.872
Yeah, maybe.

01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:08.358
I told you those
girls were nuts.

01:22:08.401 --> 01:22:09.707
Nah, Hank, come on
man we gotta go.

01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:11.709
- Oh, shit.
- Come on, come on, come on.

01:22:13.754 --> 01:22:14.886
Aw.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:15.974
Aah.

01:22:16.018 --> 01:22:18.237
Ha-ha.
Okay, wait I should go.

01:22:18.281 --> 01:22:20.413
- I feel bad.
- Yeah?

01:22:20.457 --> 01:22:23.199
I haven't yelled at my
mom like that in so long.

01:22:23.242 --> 01:22:26.071
Okay, well...

01:22:26.115 --> 01:22:27.855
Maybe just one more game.

01:22:29.727 --> 01:22:31.163
Well, let me see
what she says.

01:22:31.207 --> 01:22:32.686
Sure.

01:22:34.688 --> 01:22:37.300
Hey, Mom, open up.

01:22:37.343 --> 01:22:38.997
Just a second, Charlie.

01:22:39.041 --> 01:22:42.348
Please don't hurt Ashley.

01:22:42.392 --> 01:22:43.915
All you have to do
is tell her

01:22:43.959 --> 01:22:46.265
that we have a little
errand to run together.

01:22:46.309 --> 01:22:48.441
I won't hurt her.

01:22:48.485 --> 01:22:52.228
I promise. Just please
don't hurt my girl.

01:22:53.490 --> 01:22:54.752
Please.

01:23:02.499 --> 01:23:05.023
Hi.

01:23:05.067 --> 01:23:07.330
I'm sorry I freaked out.

01:23:07.373 --> 01:23:08.896
We can go now if you want.

01:23:12.074 --> 01:23:14.728
You know, I'll just
meet you at home.

01:23:14.772 --> 01:23:17.905
Jenny and I just have
to run a quick errand.

01:23:20.082 --> 01:23:22.388
Is everything okay?

01:23:22.432 --> 01:23:24.086
Yeah, you kids just have fun.

01:23:30.396 --> 01:23:32.050
That was weird.

01:23:32.094 --> 01:23:33.138
Winner's ball.

01:23:33.182 --> 01:23:34.487
Aw, okay.

01:23:34.531 --> 01:23:36.968
That's sweet,
that's real good.

01:23:38.361 --> 01:23:39.971
Walk.

01:23:41.755 --> 01:23:43.583
Walk.

01:24:02.994 --> 01:24:05.214
Heather isn't at
her aunts, is she?

01:24:05.257 --> 01:24:07.955
You should've left
when I told you to.

01:24:09.174 --> 01:24:11.742
Now you can't leave

01:24:11.785 --> 01:24:14.092
because you saw
what's in the purse.

01:24:14.136 --> 01:24:16.573
No, no,
we won't tell anyone.

01:24:16.616 --> 01:24:18.357
We'll leave.

01:24:18.401 --> 01:24:21.534
We won't let anyone know
that you killed your friends.

01:24:21.578 --> 01:24:23.710
Friends?

01:24:23.754 --> 01:24:26.974
You think
they were my friends?

01:24:27.018 --> 01:24:29.890
We were each
other's competition.

01:24:29.934 --> 01:24:31.979
You think we were
competing for Michael?

01:24:33.503 --> 01:24:36.506
Of course, you little
idiot, who else?

01:24:36.549 --> 01:24:38.464
Let's go.

01:24:40.727 --> 01:24:42.077
Open the door.

01:24:43.904 --> 01:24:44.818
Open it.

01:24:50.128 --> 01:24:51.695
Which one's your car?

01:24:53.218 --> 01:24:55.177
Where are we going?

01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:56.656
You're gonna have
a little mishap

01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:58.267
with your baking equipment.

01:24:59.833 --> 01:25:00.791
You're the
last one I was with.

01:25:00.834 --> 01:25:02.314
They'll know it was you.

01:25:02.358 --> 01:25:04.621
Nobody's found out
so far.

01:25:09.104 --> 01:25:10.017
No.

01:25:11.628 --> 01:25:12.672
- Get off.
- No!

01:25:14.544 --> 01:25:15.719
No!

01:25:17.155 --> 01:25:18.548
No, you don't.
No!

01:25:18.591 --> 01:25:21.464
No, no, no!

01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:31.343
Hey! Hey!

01:25:31.387 --> 01:25:32.562
What's going on here?

01:25:32.605 --> 01:25:34.477
- Ladies, knock it off!
- Lena!

01:25:37.088 --> 01:25:38.437
- Get off of me.
- No.

01:25:38.481 --> 01:25:40.483
Get off of me.
I will gut you like a fish.

01:25:40.526 --> 01:25:42.093
Lena, Lena, Lena.

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:43.181
- Break it up.
- Come on, baby.

01:25:43.225 --> 01:25:45.879
- Jenny.
- Thank God you're here.

01:25:45.923 --> 01:25:47.533
- Hank.
- Hank, hold her.

01:25:47.577 --> 01:25:48.926
Calm down, everybody calm down.

01:25:48.969 --> 01:25:51.320
Quiet everyone.
What's going on here?

01:25:51.363 --> 01:25:52.277
She tried to kill me?

01:25:52.321 --> 01:25:53.713
She's a liar.

01:25:53.757 --> 01:25:54.845
I was trying
to get the knife.

01:25:54.888 --> 01:25:55.933
No, I don't have a knife.

01:25:55.976 --> 01:25:57.239
Hank, you have to
listen to me.

01:25:57.282 --> 01:25:59.502
She's the one who killed
Casey and Heather.

01:25:59.545 --> 01:26:00.981
You're insane.

01:26:01.025 --> 01:26:02.853
She has their
cellphones in her bag.

01:26:02.896 --> 01:26:04.811
Which you planted.
This is a set up.

01:26:04.855 --> 01:26:06.073
She's trying to frame me!

01:26:06.117 --> 01:26:08.293
She's been lying
about everything.

01:26:08.337 --> 01:26:10.730
She's been texting on
them this whole time.

01:26:10.774 --> 01:26:12.558
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny!

01:26:12.602 --> 01:26:15.170
Hey, we're friends.
We're friends.

01:26:15.213 --> 01:26:16.867
I promise you,
I'll forgive you.

01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:20.827
Just tell me the truth.
Where's Beth?

01:26:20.871 --> 01:26:22.307
Beth?

01:26:22.351 --> 01:26:25.267
She left you because
she's a bad person.

01:26:27.138 --> 01:26:29.358
- Listen, Hank.
- Yeah.

01:26:29.401 --> 01:26:30.663
You have to believe me.

01:26:30.707 --> 01:26:32.578
- Jenny, we'll sort this out.
- You know me.

01:26:32.622 --> 01:26:33.927
I have an idea.

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:36.843
- Just trust me.
- For years.

01:26:36.887 --> 01:26:38.367
- I know you.
- You don't know her.

01:26:38.410 --> 01:26:40.456
I knew you would save me.

01:26:40.499 --> 01:26:41.935
You have the
phones in your possession

01:26:41.979 --> 01:26:44.590
- along with your bag?
- I don't.

01:26:48.638 --> 01:26:50.074
No, you cannot have him!

01:26:50.117 --> 01:26:51.075
Jenny, calm down!

01:26:51.118 --> 01:26:52.642
- No!
- Jenny!

01:26:52.685 --> 01:26:54.426
- Jenny!
- Hey, hey!

01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:56.298
No, you can't have him!

01:26:56.341 --> 01:26:57.081
I have to cuff you, Jen!

01:26:57.124 --> 01:26:58.430
He's mine!

01:26:58.474 --> 01:26:59.953
- You can't do this!
- Jenny, calm down.

01:26:59.997 --> 01:27:01.781
- Mike, help me with her.
- I got you, I got you.

01:27:01.825 --> 01:27:03.174
Do we have cuffs, I got her.

01:27:03.218 --> 01:27:05.437
Jenny I
got her it's okay.

01:27:05.481 --> 01:27:07.526
- We're gonna stand you up now.
- Be cool.

01:27:07.570 --> 01:27:08.614
We're gonna get to
the bottom of this.

01:27:08.658 --> 01:27:10.050
We'll figure this out, okay.

01:27:10.094 --> 01:27:11.835
Michael, how could you do this?

01:27:11.878 --> 01:27:14.359
How could you?

01:27:14.403 --> 01:27:16.970
You were supposed
to be my husband.

01:27:17.014 --> 01:27:19.277
You were supposed
to be Charlie's dad.

01:27:20.757 --> 01:27:23.194
I did everything right.

01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:26.241
You were
supposed to kiss me.

01:27:26.284 --> 01:27:28.460
You were supposed
to love me.

01:27:28.504 --> 01:27:31.376
I got rid of all of
those other skanks,

01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:33.335
so that we could be together.

01:27:33.378 --> 01:27:34.814
You got rid of 'em?

01:27:34.858 --> 01:27:37.077
For Charlie.

01:27:37.121 --> 01:27:39.993
'Cause he deserves
a good man in his life.

01:27:40.037 --> 01:27:42.518
You know him.
He needs a daddy.

01:27:42.561 --> 01:27:43.693
- Mom.
- Mom.

01:27:43.736 --> 01:27:45.172
- Mom.
- Mom.

01:27:45.216 --> 01:27:46.478
- You know him.
- Charlie, it's all right.

01:27:46.522 --> 01:27:48.175
- Mom.
- Charlie, honey.

01:27:48.219 --> 01:27:50.003
Charlie, it's okay.

01:27:50.047 --> 01:27:52.223
- Look I gotta take your
mom for a little while.
- What'd you do?

01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:54.399
- It's gonna
be okay, all right.
- What'd she do?

01:27:54.443 --> 01:27:55.574
We're just gonna sort
this all out, all right.

01:27:55.618 --> 01:27:57.010
Charlie, honey.

01:27:57.054 --> 01:27:59.448
Jenny, I have to put
you under arrest.

01:27:59.491 --> 01:28:00.666
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:28:00.710 --> 01:28:02.494
Whatever you say
can and will be used

01:28:02.538 --> 01:28:03.800
against you in a court of law.

01:28:03.843 --> 01:28:05.105
You have a right to an attorney.

01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:06.324
If you can't afford one,

01:28:06.368 --> 01:28:07.804
the court will
appoint one to you.

01:28:07.847 --> 01:28:08.718
Do you understand
you're rights, Jenny?

01:28:08.761 --> 01:28:10.328
Mom, mom, please.

01:28:10.372 --> 01:28:12.199
- It's alright get in there.
- Mom, what's happening?

01:28:12.243 --> 01:28:15.638
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:28:15.681 --> 01:28:16.943
Please, don't take my mom.

01:28:16.987 --> 01:28:18.641
- I understand.
- Okay, please don't my mom.

01:28:18.684 --> 01:28:20.120
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- Hank, Hank please.

01:28:20.164 --> 01:28:21.426
- Mom, what's going on?
- I promise, Charlie.

01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:24.299
You guys look I gotta
call social services

01:28:24.342 --> 01:28:25.865
unless somebody can take
care of Charlie right now.

01:28:25.909 --> 01:28:27.389
- No.
- Charlie, come with me.

01:28:27.432 --> 01:28:29.434
No, please, don't take my mom.

01:28:29.478 --> 01:28:31.175
I'm sorry, alright,
I have to take.

01:28:31.218 --> 01:28:33.351
Charlie, you can come see
her in a couple of hours.

01:28:33.395 --> 01:28:34.700
- Charlie.
- You all right.

01:28:34.744 --> 01:28:36.615
I didn't do it, baby.

01:28:36.659 --> 01:28:38.748
I didn't do this, Hank.

01:28:38.791 --> 01:28:40.793
- Alright, you alright?
- What'd she do?

01:28:40.837 --> 01:28:42.795
We don't know yet, Charlie.

01:28:45.494 --> 01:28:46.538
I love you so much, baby.

01:28:46.582 --> 01:28:47.844
I love you so much.

01:28:47.887 --> 01:28:49.106
It'll be all right.

01:29:08.604 --> 01:29:09.692
- You ready.
- Mm-hmm.

01:29:11.258 --> 01:29:12.434
Go.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.915
Come on, Charlie,
play some D.

01:29:16.742 --> 01:29:18.353
Whoo, yeah!

01:29:18.396 --> 01:29:19.789
That's my girl!

01:29:19.832 --> 01:29:22.487
Why'd you
stop using that move?

01:29:22.531 --> 01:29:24.533
Ash, you wanna be on
my team next time?

01:29:24.576 --> 01:29:25.795
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:29:25.838 --> 01:29:27.231
I'm not getting
stuck with Charlie.

01:29:27.274 --> 01:29:28.537
Hey.

01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:30.626
Sorry, I only play
on my mom's team.

01:29:30.669 --> 01:29:31.931
Yeah.

01:29:31.975 --> 01:29:33.411
Hey, Ash, you wanna
go grab a drink?

01:29:33.455 --> 01:29:34.586
Yeah.

01:29:40.810 --> 01:29:42.072
So how are things going?

01:29:42.115 --> 01:29:44.422
It's going okay.

01:29:44.466 --> 01:29:46.772
Charlie needs some
kind of parent.

01:29:46.816 --> 01:29:49.471
I'm no good at it,
but I'm learning.

01:29:50.689 --> 01:29:52.430
How's he
handling everything?

01:29:52.474 --> 01:29:54.084
Good days, bad days,

01:29:54.127 --> 01:29:56.608
but I'll be there for
him regardless, you know.

01:29:58.523 --> 01:29:59.568
And how are you?

01:30:02.484 --> 01:30:04.529
I think, I'm still in shock.

01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:09.273
Any word on Jenny?

01:30:10.883 --> 01:30:12.537
She told the cops where
all the bodies were.

01:30:12.581 --> 01:30:14.713
They found all the girls,

01:30:14.757 --> 01:30:19.457
Jenny's husband
stuffed in barrels
down by the lake, and...

01:30:21.372 --> 01:30:23.243
Beth.

01:30:23.287 --> 01:30:26.508
We'd have had a family
together, you know.

01:30:26.551 --> 01:30:29.032
I just can't believe
she's gone.

01:30:30.729 --> 01:30:32.949
I promise it will
get easier with time.

01:30:34.951 --> 01:30:37.432
You know,

01:30:37.475 --> 01:30:41.174
we could go on
that second date.

01:30:42.915 --> 01:30:46.789
If things are still too
crazy, I totally understand.

01:30:48.094 --> 01:30:50.096
I'd love to.

01:30:52.751 --> 01:30:54.449
Really?

01:30:54.492 --> 01:30:56.842
Really would.

01:30:56.886 --> 01:30:59.845
Hey, Ashley, time
to make dinner.

01:31:02.587 --> 01:31:04.415
Again.

01:31:04.459 --> 01:31:06.461
Little love birds.

01:31:08.158 --> 01:31:11.988
I will see you tomorrow
night at eight, sharp.

01:31:12.031 --> 01:31:13.642
I'll be there.

01:31:15.905 --> 01:31:17.994
So.

01:31:20.083 --> 01:31:21.432
Is Charlie your boyfriend now?

01:31:21.476 --> 01:31:23.652
Mom, come on.

01:31:23.695 --> 01:31:25.654
Please don't make it weird.

01:31:28.918 --> 01:31:30.920
You know,
maybe it's time

01:31:30.963 --> 01:31:32.617
I had a little romance
in my life too.

01:31:32.661 --> 01:31:34.445
- Yes.
- Yeah.

01:31:34.489 --> 01:31:36.491
Definitely.

01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:40.799
It has to be weird, I know.

01:32:40.163 --> 01:32:42.252
