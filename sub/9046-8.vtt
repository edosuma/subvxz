00:02.762 --> 00:04.227
He's the guy your mom
should have married.

00:04.229 --> 00:05.563
My mom's staying at the hotel,

00:05.564 --> 00:07.230
so we've got the place
to ourselves.

00:07.232 --> 00:08.966
Ask Matty, he had a piece
of your Hamilton Pie

00:08.968 --> 00:10.367
long before you did.

00:10.369 --> 00:11.802
And one more thing...

00:11.804 --> 00:13.303
I love you, Jake Rosati.

00:13.305 --> 00:15.305
Gone were the secrets
and heartache of my past.

00:15.307 --> 00:17.107
I was looking at my future.

00:24.249 --> 00:26.550
Timing.
It was everything,

00:26.552 --> 00:28.351
and my time had arrived.

00:28.353 --> 00:29.887
I was head over heels for Jake

00:29.889 --> 00:33.223
and ready to show him,
because our love was the stuff

00:33.225 --> 00:35.492
of poetry, of novels, of blogs.

00:35.494 --> 00:37.461
We were like Romeo and Juliet,

00:37.463 --> 00:40.064
except our love story didn't
involve a fake suicide.

00:40.066 --> 00:41.599
Been there, done that.

00:41.601 --> 00:44.501
How about we make our getaway
before things get ugly?

00:44.503 --> 00:46.737
They already have.

00:46.739 --> 00:48.038
- What's wrong?
- Us.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.207
But "us" was great.
"Us" was perfect.

00:50.209 --> 00:52.576
"Us" was about to go back
to my house and do it.

00:52.578 --> 00:54.511
If you're not ready,
it's totally okay.

00:54.513 --> 00:57.014
- There's no pressure.
- I don't want to do this here.

00:57.016 --> 01:00.317
So how about we do this
at my house?

01:00.319 --> 01:02.385
- Maybe in my bed?
- I'm not feeling it.

01:02.387 --> 01:06.857
This relationship.
I don't want to lead you on.

01:06.859 --> 01:08.859
- Are you being serious?
- Yeah.

01:08.861 --> 01:10.628
I think our timing is off.

01:10.630 --> 01:13.063
What does that mean?

something to say.

02:11.523 --> 02:12.923
Okay, now I do.

02:12.925 --> 02:14.524
Why would Jake dump you?
He busted out

02:14.526 --> 02:16.493
the "L" word.
You must have misunderstood.

02:16.495 --> 02:17.961
It's kind of hard
to misunderstand

02:17.963 --> 02:20.097
"I'm breaking up with you."

02:20.099 --> 02:21.999
No misinterpreting that.

02:22.001 --> 02:23.500
He said our timing was off.

02:23.502 --> 02:25.736
Maybe I waited too long
to say "I love you,"

02:25.738 --> 02:27.604

I'm gonna get the real deets.

My heart was broken into
a million pieces,

02:35.614 --> 02:38.481
but unfortunately,
my mind was still intact,

02:38.483 --> 02:41.218

the unsettling realization

02:41.220 --> 02:43.620

weird non-answers

You know, I have been trying
to get to you all night,

07:47.592 --> 07:49.892

has been on my tail.

07:49.894 --> 07:51.628

what's going on.

08:25.930 --> 08:27.096
Just talk to me.

08:27.098 --> 08:30.933
Fine. Get in.

08:38.575 --> 08:40.109
We were gonna go out
for some Mexican food,

08:40.111 --> 08:43.145

08:43.148 --> 08:44.747
"let's go get some enchiladas,"

We were pretty crazy
growing up.

09:13.444 --> 09:17.479

- Ally.

09:19.584 --> 09:23.319
I've known Ally for...

09:23.321 --> 09:25.021
Two weeks now?

09:25.023 --> 09:27.423
Which doesn't seem like
a long time,

09:27.425 --> 09:29.225
but if you think about it,

09:29.227 --> 09:32.061
it's about a third of the time
that she's known the groom.

09:34.065 --> 09:35.865
So let's just pretend like we're
dealing in dog years, right?

09:37.936 --> 09:39.068
See, Gare?

09:39.070 --> 09:41.971
How it's done.

09:41.973 --> 09:45.875
I'd be lying if I said
I never thought about you.

09:45.877 --> 09:50.780
Well, I know that we missed
our chance in high school,

09:50.782 --> 09:52.849
but... now that we are

09:52.851 --> 09:54.951
older and wiser.

09:56.287 --> 09:59.588
Hmm, I might be older,
but I am definitely not wiser.

09:59.590 --> 10:01.858
I don't know
if you heard, but...

10:01.860 --> 10:06.295
I ruined my marriage,
and... my daughter hates me.

10:06.297 --> 10:07.696
Utterly impossible.

10:07.698 --> 10:10.833
The only one who could
ever hate you is me.

10:10.835 --> 10:13.136
You? Why you?

10:13.138 --> 10:15.638
For breaking my heart

10:15.640 --> 10:17.673
and choosing the other guy,
what's his name?

10:17.675 --> 10:20.309
Come on,
you were never heartbroken.

10:20.311 --> 10:21.710
For years.

10:21.712 --> 10:24.747
And I will stay that way,

10:24.749 --> 10:29.218
unless you make good
on an outstanding debt.

10:29.220 --> 10:30.452
And what would that be?

10:30.454 --> 10:32.822
You offered
me a kiss good-bye.

10:32.824 --> 10:38.627
Mm. Which, as I recall,
you did not collect.

10:38.629 --> 10:41.430
But, see, that was a mistake,

10:41.432 --> 10:43.599

to right that wrong.

12:14.493 --> 12:16.694
Listen, your dad's the one

12:16.696 --> 12:19.330
who ruined their relationship,
and it started years ago.

13:54.994 --> 13:56.327

out there

14:04.570 --> 14:07.839
then Ben wasn't
my mother's Matty, my dad was,

14:07.841 --> 14:10.908

14:10.910 --> 14:12.509

didn't destroy me,

Would my mom have ended up
with Ben if it wasn't for me?

14:24.457 --> 14:27.124
That bartender
would not tend to me.

14:27.126 --> 14:29.160

is here to save the day.

- Mm.

14:40.439 --> 14:41.873
- Hey!
- Okay.

14:41.875 --> 14:43.507
Hey, that's my shot.

14:43.509 --> 14:45.809

should not be taken lightly.

14:48.214 --> 14:49.546

- No more.

for making sure that

14:52.551 --> 14:55.652
the bride is presentable

be in my wedding pictures.

I didn't meet his deadline,

15:33.226 --> 15:35.559
maybe I was lucky
to get out when I did.

15:35.561 --> 15:37.828
Or maybe I was just trying
to make myself feel better
