00:10.920 --> 00:12.250
- Hey, Olive. What are you doing?
- Don't move!

00:14.620 --> 00:16.590
Why can't I move?

00:16.620 --> 00:19.260
Because, for my Black
History Month presentation,

00:19.290 --> 00:21.490
I'm making a memory quilt
traditionally used by

00:21.530 --> 00:26.230
African-American women to document
national, family, and personal histories.

00:26.270 --> 00:29.200
Right now, I'm preserving
the memory of me telling you

00:29.240 --> 00:31.640
that I'm making a memory quilt.

00:31.670 --> 00:35.240
Well, I'm glad you found something
connected to your talent to do.

00:35.270 --> 00:37.210
I'm really struggling.

00:37.240 --> 00:40.610
How am I supposed to fit the entire
history of African-American music

00:40.650 --> 00:42.580
into a two minute song?

00:42.620 --> 00:44.380
All I have so far is.

00:44.420 --> 00:47.390
<i>♪ Ella Fitzgerald read</i>
<i>the</i> New York Herald.

00:47.420 --> 00:49.390
<i>♪ At the top is Aretha</i>

00:49.420 --> 00:50.590
<i>♪ And everyone's beneath her</i>

00:52.530 --> 00:54.290
Why don't you scat?

00:54.330 --> 00:57.530
Hey, you think I should work
scat singing into my song?

00:57.560 --> 00:59.360
No, I mean scat. Go away.

01:00.730 --> 01:02.470
Your bad song is making me sad,

01:02.500 --> 01:04.670
and I don't want any
unhappy memories in my quilt.

01:06.640 --> 01:09.470
You're right. I'm just going to
take all these books and albums

01:09.510 --> 01:11.180
and go into the sound booth.

01:11.210 --> 01:13.610
And I'm not coming out
until I write a great song.

01:15.410 --> 01:18.650
<i>♪ I service the school</i>
<i>by rocking! ♪</i>

01:23.590 --> 01:24.660
Fletcher, what are you doing?

01:25.660 --> 01:27.330
Preparing my presentation.

01:28.630 --> 01:29.590
Skadoosh!

01:31.530 --> 01:33.360
Fletcher, it's Black History Month,

01:33.400 --> 01:34.670
not Jack Black History Month.

01:37.150 --> 01:38.600
I thought it was weird
he got a whole month.

Man, good thing fell on meurine

02:46.570 --> 02:50.680
and not that anvil for no apparent reason.

02:58.550 --> 03:01.550
What in the world is going on?

03:01.590 --> 03:04.320
There you are! I've been
looking all over for you!

03:04.360 --> 03:08.560
Cameron? Where are we?
All dressed up?

03:08.590 --> 03:11.530
I already told you,
to be your date to the prom.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.170
Cameron?
Who's Cameron?

03:15.200 --> 03:17.300
Listen, dollface, you gotta get onstage.

03:17.340 --> 03:19.570
People come to hear you sing, not me.

03:19.610 --> 03:21.610
Last time I sang, they threw soup at me.

03:22.610 --> 03:25.510
And it was still in the can.

03:25.540 --> 03:31.350
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
We're at The Cotton Club? In 193os New York?

03:31.380 --> 03:36.250
Mom and d flip out if I go to the
bathroom without telling them first.

03:36.290 --> 03:38.390
What's the matter, Ella?
You flipped your wig?

03:39.490 --> 03:42.160
Ella? Why did you
just call me Ella?

03:42.190 --> 03:44.600
Because that's your name.
Ella Fitzgerald.

03:44.630 --> 03:46.160
What?

03:52.600 --> 03:56.510
This is insane. I look amazing.
But this is insane!

03:58.380 --> 04:01.480
Come on, move those gams.
You're on in two minutes!

04:01.510 --> 04:05.450
I'm singing? At The Cotton Club?
In two minutes?

04:07.620 --> 04:11.420
Wait! Wait! There's just one
thing I really need to know.

04:11.460 --> 04:14.430
Does an entire steak dinner
really ly cost a nickel?

04:14.460 --> 04:17.360
Because my grandma says that
everything in the '3os cost a nickel.

04:22.530 --> 04:25.270
Hey, what's that panel supposed to be?

04:25.300 --> 04:28.110
This is one of my favorite memories,

04:28.140 --> 04:30.170
the day you blew out your birthday candles

04:30.210 --> 04:32.180
and your party hat caught fire.

04:33.580 --> 04:36.310
I don't know why I wished for that.

04:36.350 --> 04:38.520
Olive, you can't put that on your quilt!

04:38.550 --> 04:40.550
It makes me look foolish.

04:40.590 --> 04:42.450
Does the quilt make you look foolish

04:42.490 --> 04:44.560
or does your foolishness
make you look foolish?

04:46.230 --> 04:50.230
I don't have time for your brain teasers!

04:50.260 --> 04:52.500
I don't want anything embarrassing
about me in your quilt!

04:52.530 --> 04:54.170
Now give me that!
No!

04:54.470 --> 04:56.300
Hey!

04:56.340 --> 04:58.300
Seriously, give me that quilt!
No!

04:59.240 --> 05:00.270
Whoa!

05:19.190 --> 05:21.530
Do you look sad because
you lost your sheep?

05:33.210 --> 05:35.270
Psst.
 Cameron.

05:36.540 --> 05:38.410
Cameron.

05:38.440 --> 05:39.410
Excuse me.

05:43.480 --> 05:44.450
Cameron!

05:45.380 --> 05:47.420
I mean, piano guy!

05:47.450 --> 05:50.320
Listen, I don't know what's going on,
but I've got to get out of here.

05:50.360 --> 05:52.220
What? Ella,
if you don't sing,

05:52.260 --> 05:53.390
we'll have to answer to the boss.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.260
He doesn't look that scary.

05:59.300 --> 06:00.330
What about his goons?

06:03.240 --> 06:05.400
Okay. Now, they look
adequately scary.

06:05.440 --> 06:08.240
But I cannot sing this song.
I don't know the words.

06:08.270 --> 06:10.140
You better come up with something!

06:46.210 --> 06:47.210
Hey!

06:52.520 --> 06:55.350
Ella, I've never heard anything like that.

06:55.390 --> 06:56.590
What do you call it?

06:56.620 --> 06:58.260
Scat.

06:58.290 --> 07:00.420
All right, I'll leave.
I was just asking a question.

07:05.130 --> 07:08.270
That was the cat's meow.

07:08.300 --> 07:11.070
You got pipes, kid.
I'll give you that.

07:11.100 --> 07:12.500
Eh. I've heard better.

07:14.540 --> 07:17.070
How much to keep a canary like you singing?

07:17.510 --> 07:20.110
I don't know, a nickel?

07:20.150 --> 07:24.280
A nickel! Well, you drive a hard
bargain but a nickel it is.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.390
What are you doing throwing
around nickels for?

07:28.420 --> 07:32.320
You want to spend a nickel,
buy me a diamond necklace.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.260
What are you doing?

07:39.300 --> 07:41.200
You know people like us aren't
allowed in the audience.

07:42.570 --> 07:46.240
Wait. Are you saying only white
people can watch the show?

07:50.480 --> 07:54.210
So, we can work here
and make money for you,

07:54.250 --> 07:58.080
but because of our skin color we
can't sit in the audience as equals?

07:59.220 --> 08:00.420
Well, that's stupid!

08:05.090 --> 08:07.360
Hey, everyone!
Come out here!

08:14.230 --> 08:16.370
Wow! This place
is really nice!

08:19.400 --> 08:24.180
I just want to let you guys know that
things are gonna be better for us.

08:24.210 --> 08:25.440
Because people like Ella Fitzgerald

08:25.480 --> 08:28.410
are gonna stand up against discrimination.

08:28.450 --> 08:33.179
And until things change, I will never
perform in a place like this again.

08:37.520 --> 08:41.059
And one day, you're going
to see how wrong you are!

08:46.060 --> 08:48.070
I'll show you!

08:48.100 --> 08:52.040
Wait until you see
a picture of President Obama!

08:52.070 --> 08:55.270
Or Nelson Mandela's Nobel Prize.

08:55.310 --> 08:58.280
Or find out how much Oprah makes.
It's more than a nickel!

08:59.240 --> 09:00.480
Get a load of this, you jerks!

09:04.250 --> 09:07.220
Um, I mean...
Hallelujah!

09:17.520 --> 09:21.160
Where have you been?
You are late for choir again!

09:21.620 --> 09:25.190
Dad? Why are you
dressed like that?

09:25.230 --> 09:27.360
How else would a reverend dress?

09:27.400 --> 09:29.330
You're a reverend?

09:29.360 --> 09:32.200
I don't think I've ever seen
you awake in church before.

09:34.340 --> 09:38.470
Where were you? Were you working
on that popular music again?

09:38.510 --> 09:43.440
You know I support that, but on Sunday
your place is in the church, Aretha.

09:43.480 --> 09:46.550
Hey, am I Aretha Franklin?

09:46.580 --> 09:48.520
Well, that's what we named you.

09:48.550 --> 09:51.250
Of course, my first choice
was Benjamin Franklin,

09:51.290 --> 09:53.290
but your mother has no sense of humor.

09:57.360 --> 10:01.530
Oh, wow, I am awesome!

10:01.560 --> 10:04.430
Aretha, I did not raise you to be boastful.

10:04.470 --> 10:07.270
Do you hear me bragging
about how handsome I am?

10:07.300 --> 10:09.470
I mean I could, but I don't!

10:11.370 --> 10:13.610
You know, maybe you should ease up on me,

10:13.640 --> 10:18.410
because something tells me I might make
this popular music thing work out.

10:18.450 --> 10:22.350
I don't know. Some of that
popular music worries me.

10:22.380 --> 10:24.420
All that talk of
"rocking around the clock."

10:24.450 --> 10:25.690
Why are they up so late?

10:27.390 --> 10:29.260
Now get up there for your solo.

10:29.290 --> 10:30.590
You're doing
<i>Amazing Grace.</i>

10:33.330 --> 10:34.530
Oh, it'll be amazing.

10:39.670 --> 10:44.270

Mom, I don't think this is

11:45.700 --> 11:47.700
But I made all this kugel!

11:55.580 --> 11:57.610
<i>Hey, Olive.</i>

11:57.650 --> 11:59.610
Sorry, Fletcher, I can't talk right now.

11:59.650 --> 12:01.480
I'm sewing a panel of you in swim class.

12:04.690 --> 12:07.590
<i>You know, you've been working</i>
<i>so hard on that quilt,</i>

12:07.620 --> 12:10.220
<i>maybe you should just</i> <i>leave the
Ant Farm</i> <i>and take a break.</i>

12:10.260 --> 12:12.460
<i>Just leave the quilt</i>
<i>right there in the Ant Farm,</i>

12:12.490 --> 12:14.390
<i>and walk away,</i>
<i>and take a break.</i>

12:14.430 --> 12:16.560
<i>Once again,</i> <i>leaving the quilt right
there</i> <i>in the Ant Farm, unattended.</i>

12:18.400 --> 12:21.670
Nice try, Fletcher.
I am going to take a break

12:21.700 --> 12:23.640
but I'm going to leave
my quilt in my locker,

12:23.670 --> 12:26.510
where you can't get to it.

12:26.540 --> 12:31.510
Like stealing candy from a candy store.
Staffed completely by babies.

12:34.250 --> 12:37.380
Ah, my quilt should be safe in here.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.620
Especially since it will be
guarded by my pet ferret, Bitey.

13:05.380 --> 13:08.580
I call this one, Fletcher's First Kiss.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.430
So, what did you think?

13:18.460 --> 13:21.560
You managed to combine church
music and popular music

13:21.600 --> 13:24.230
into something incredible.

13:24.270 --> 13:26.430
Much like you managed to combine

13:26.470 --> 13:30.670
egg noodle and cottage cheese into
something equally incredible!

13:33.270 --> 13:35.240
I'll mail you
the recipe, <i>bubeleh.</i>

13:38.250 --> 13:42.250
You'll see, Dad.
One day, I'll record hit records,

13:42.280 --> 13:45.490
play sold-out concerts,
and be the Queen of Soul!

13:45.520 --> 13:48.260
I don't doubt it for a second.

13:48.290 --> 13:50.620
I don't know. A musician?

13:50.660 --> 13:53.430
It's not a very stable profession.

13:55.700 --> 13:57.560
I'm going into typewriter repair.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.600
There will always be a need for that.

14:03.400 --> 14:06.270
Well, if everything's good here,

14:06.310 --> 14:08.110
I kind of have a song I need to write.

14:09.240 --> 14:12.410
Wait!
Take some kugel!

14:19.590 --> 14:23.420
Where's my kugel?
Now, I'm hungry.

14:25.460 --> 14:27.490
Hey, I've got a nickel.

14:27.530 --> 14:30.500
Maybe I can go back to the
193os and get a steak dinner.

14:36.340 --> 14:37.340
What?

14:38.440 --> 14:40.210
Where am I?

14:53.450 --> 14:55.190
Cut!

14:56.320 --> 14:58.560
Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut!

15:01.530 --> 15:04.460
Michael! Will you please
keep her out of the shot?

15:14.210 --> 15:16.340
Sorry, I'll take care of it.

15:21.620 --> 15:24.280
Wait, you're Michael Jackson?

15:25.450 --> 15:28.220
Is this the Thriller video?

15:28.260 --> 15:31.190
Yes. And you may be
my little sister, Janet,

15:31.230 --> 15:33.190
but right now, I need you to...

15:34.630 --> 15:36.260
Beat it!

15:38.370 --> 15:40.220
Yeah, beat it!

15:49.370 --> 15:53.370
I can't believe this.
I'm Janet Jackson!

15:53.410 --> 15:54.570
Annie, are you okay?

16:00.450 --> 16:05.350
Whoa! This is amazing.
I'm such a huge fan!

16:05.390 --> 16:08.190
Well, who isn't?
I'm the King of Pop!

16:08.220 --> 16:10.260
Just ask the man
in the mirror! Hee hee!

16:12.290 --> 16:13.360
Shamon!

16:16.330 --> 16:19.400
I mean, I'm a huge fan of Janet Jackson.

16:19.430 --> 16:23.270
Well, good for you.
You have to believe in yourself.

16:23.300 --> 16:25.110
Even if you weren't in the Jackson 5.

16:26.370 --> 16:28.340
Or as most people call us,

16:28.380 --> 16:31.440
Michael Jackson and Four Other Dudes.

16:31.480 --> 16:35.550
Don't be silly.
People know your name, Jermaine.

16:35.580 --> 16:37.320
My name is Tito.

16:39.150 --> 16:42.160
And don't you forget it,
Mr. Jackson, sir.

16:45.590 --> 16:47.260
Thanks, Toto.

16:49.460 --> 16:52.230
Anyway, quit trying to get in the video.

16:52.270 --> 16:55.340
Michael's the star of the family.
Just accept it.

16:55.370 --> 16:57.370
Well, Janet's going to be a star, too!

17:02.210 --> 17:03.410
Give me a beat!

17:15.420 --> 17:20.130
Hey, guys, check this out!
Five, four, three, two, one!

17:33.340 --> 17:37.080
Olive, you're never going to believe this.
I had the craziest dream.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.410
Lexi made a kugel!

17:45.350 --> 17:49.220
We've really need to find a
better place to keep that anvil.

17:49.260 --> 17:53.260
Forget that. Let's go.
Our presentations are starting now.

17:53.290 --> 17:56.060
What? I still have
to write my song.

17:57.330 --> 17:58.530
You've got to stall them!

17:58.570 --> 18:02.240
How? I mean, I don't know
if I could pull it off,

18:02.270 --> 18:05.340
but I guess I could try to be
verbose and long-winded.

18:05.370 --> 18:07.440
Interesting factoid about
the term "long-winded"...

18:07.480 --> 18:09.380
You know what?
I think you can pull it off.

18:14.350 --> 18:17.080
African-American
Mark Dean led the team

18:17.120 --> 18:20.390
responsible for creating the one
gigahertz computer processor.

18:20.420 --> 18:24.120
Thanks to him, we can use computers
for such important tasks

18:24.160 --> 18:27.490
as medical imaging,
regulating financial markets,

18:27.530 --> 18:30.330
and watching videos of babies
trying lemons for the first time.

18:41.340 --> 18:43.480
For my presentation, I have
followed in the footsteps

18:43.510 --> 18:46.080
of centuries of
African-American women,

18:46.110 --> 18:49.520
who documented their histories
in the form of memory quilts.

18:49.550 --> 18:53.520
I'm using "document" not in the
sense of a piece of paper,

18:53.550 --> 18:56.390
but as in a record.

18:56.420 --> 19:01.060
I'm using "record" not in the
sense of a vinyl disc of music,

19:01.100 --> 19:03.500
but as in a historical document.

19:03.530 --> 19:06.270
Once again, I'm using
"document" not in a sense...

19:06.300 --> 19:08.030
Get on with it!

19:09.240 --> 19:13.010
Okay. Let me show you some
of the memories on my quilt.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.110
This is the time Fletcher laughed so hard

19:15.140 --> 19:17.010
egg salad came shooting out of his nose.

19:19.350 --> 19:23.250
And in this panel is Fletcher
eating the egg salad anyway.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.390
How many memories are on that thing?

19:27.420 --> 19:29.090
All of them.

19:34.400 --> 19:37.160
Now, to be clear, I'm using "memory"

19:37.200 --> 19:39.430
as in a cognitive recollection,

19:39.470 --> 19:43.200
not the stirring ballad from the
long-running musical <i>Cats.</i>

19:45.310 --> 19:48.070
Olive, I'm ready.
Thank you for stalling.

19:48.110 --> 19:51.080
Oh, I haven't started stalling yet.
But I could give it a try.

19:54.080 --> 19:57.080
Most of you know that
when it comes to music,

19:57.120 --> 19:59.290
I usually don't have much trouble.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.520
In fact, normally, I will
sing at the drop of a hat.

20:03.390 --> 20:04.390
Oh, darn it!

20:07.490 --> 20:10.300
But when it came time
to write a song for today,

20:10.330 --> 20:12.330
I thought I was struggling.

20:12.370 --> 20:15.440
Then I realized that all the
amazing African-American musicians

20:15.470 --> 20:18.470
who came before me really struggled.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.540
From the struggle to find your own voice,

20:20.570 --> 20:23.340
to finding the courage
to break with tradition,

20:23.380 --> 20:26.280
to facing out-and-out
discrimination.

20:26.310 --> 20:29.550
I was going to sing a song about
the history of Black music.

20:29.580 --> 20:33.390
But instead, I've been inspired
by these exceptional women

20:33.420 --> 20:35.360
to try someday to be
a part of that history.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.400

22:06.380 --> 22:09.450
Oh, you want an encore, Lexi?

22:09.480 --> 22:12.230
The one day I wear a hat!

22:16.630 --> 22:21.389
My Black History presentation is about
the artist, Jean-Michel Basquiat,

22:21.390 --> 22:26.009
who helped take graffiti from the Urban streets into museums.

22:26.010 --> 22:29.699
In tribute to him, I, Fletcher Quimby,

22:29.700 --> 22:31.879
will return to his roots.

22:31.880 --> 22:35.550
And create my own graffiti street art in his style.

22:36.840 --> 22:39.320
Where did I put my pin cushion?

22:44.890 --> 22:48.110
Oh, there it is!
