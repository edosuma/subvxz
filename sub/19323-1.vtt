02:17.604 --> 02:19.671
Well hello, little lady.

02:20.573 --> 02:23.575
Lemme guess.
Detention, right?

02:23.577 --> 02:26.011
Yeah. Totally bogus.

02:32.051 --> 02:33.318
Um...

02:33.320 --> 02:35.988
I've-I've gotta pee
really bad.

02:38.191 --> 02:39.658
Kids today.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.560
I used to love detention.

02:41.562 --> 02:42.961
Pick up chicks.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.597
Some of them had to pee also.

02:48.801 --> 02:52.037
Someone stayed up too late
watching mtv.

02:58.811 --> 03:00.179
I got places to be.

03:00.747 --> 03:02.114
Not.

03:02.116 --> 03:03.815
Like where?

03:03.817 --> 03:05.150
Take a bath?

03:05.152 --> 03:06.718
Hold that, Princess.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.555
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

03:10.223 --> 03:12.591
Ouch! Gag me!

03:14.495 --> 03:17.663
Oh, my god.
Who's that, y'all?

03:25.505 --> 03:26.872
Who are you?

03:27.574 --> 03:29.274
Call me Mr. roker, tough guy.

03:33.846 --> 03:35.747
Everybody sit.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.250
Boy, girl, boy, girl.

03:39.619 --> 03:41.353
And girl.

03:48.261 --> 03:49.761
Close the door.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.639
Mike swank?

04:00.641 --> 04:02.074
Yeah?

04:02.076 --> 04:04.142
Just say "here", meathead.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.344
Here.

04:06.879 --> 04:08.113
Hillary Miller.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.454
As if!
Here.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.390
Rusty Boone?

04:18.392 --> 04:19.925
Yo.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.561
- Shelly hinson.
- Here, sir.

04:23.563 --> 04:25.163
Julie Moore.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.841
Aren't we a fine looking bunch?

04:37.277 --> 04:40.545
From the looks of you, i imagine
you already know the rules.

04:40.547 --> 04:42.447
No talking,

04:42.449 --> 04:44.283
keep to yourselves,

04:44.285 --> 04:46.184
and no one, and I mean no one,

04:46.186 --> 04:48.086
leaves this room
without my permission.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.688
I can do this
standing on my head, man.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.990
Don't make me
have you prove it, son.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.194
You ladies enjoy...

04:56.196 --> 04:58.196
and I'll be back in a bit
to check on you.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.927
How's it going, Princess?

05:28.929 --> 05:30.829
Ugh, gross me out!

05:30.831 --> 05:32.497
Why don't you just
leave her alone?

05:40.307 --> 05:41.673
Mm-hmm.

05:41.675 --> 05:42.808
That's what I thought.

05:43.743 --> 05:45.877
Because you don't mess
with the bionic man.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.123
Loser.

05:59.392 --> 06:00.926
Retard.

06:02.463 --> 06:03.795
Dork.

06:06.132 --> 06:07.499
Homo.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.101
Ooh.

06:10.036 --> 06:13.572
Bet she'd do me if I put her
in the school play.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.842
What's this world comin' to?

06:19.212 --> 06:21.279
So what's your story, Princess?

06:21.281 --> 06:22.381
Story?

06:22.949 --> 06:26.118
Yeah... like, your story.

06:26.120 --> 06:29.321
I think the burnout means
why are you here?

06:30.690 --> 06:33.525
I'll tell you mine
if everyone else tells theirs.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.636
Come on.
What's your damage?

06:38.398 --> 06:41.733
Maybe I don't like handing out
my dirty laundry to strangers.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.468
Aw, come on,

06:43.470 --> 06:45.337
we're all friends
here in detention.

06:47.373 --> 06:50.409
Yeah, just like
a championship team.

06:50.411 --> 06:52.244
Come on,
as if it's that personal.

06:52.246 --> 06:53.812
Get real.

06:54.580 --> 06:57.883
Okay.
You go first.

06:58.718 --> 07:01.086
Okay, so, me
and my gal pal Brittany

07:01.088 --> 07:02.821
were, like, totally
going to Blaze out of class

07:02.823 --> 07:04.723
and stand in line
for r.E.O. Speedwagon tickets...

07:04.725 --> 07:06.124
Flamers!

07:06.793 --> 07:09.861
Uh, r.E.O. Is totally proper!

07:10.663 --> 07:12.297
Anyway...

07:12.299 --> 07:14.966
We got busted by that science
guy pulling out of the lot.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.969
Totally lame-o.
Can you relate?

07:17.971 --> 07:20.806
I can relate to what boner
smokers those guys are.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.208
R.E.O. Homowagon.

07:37.757 --> 07:39.858
What about you, four-eyes?

07:39.860 --> 07:41.827
My name is Shelly.

07:41.829 --> 07:44.729
- Ooh.
- Okay.

07:48.935 --> 07:50.769
Let's just say
i had a little run-in

07:50.771 --> 07:55.140
with someone who was...
Touching my property.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.708
Property?

07:56.710 --> 07:58.844
Like, they touched you
where you pee?

08:02.782 --> 08:04.816
Sorry.
Don't have a heart attack.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.618
Will you just let her talk?

08:06.620 --> 08:07.919
What was it?

08:09.489 --> 08:11.389
My rubik's cube.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.492
Whoa! Those are so...

08:13.494 --> 08:14.893
zeeked.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.027
Huh?

08:16.029 --> 08:17.629
Bunk?

08:17.631 --> 08:19.431
Ill? Mung?

08:20.733 --> 08:21.967
Uncool.

08:21.969 --> 08:24.703
Not more uncool
than r.E.O. Whateverwagon.

08:29.644 --> 08:30.543
Wait.

08:30.544 --> 08:34.880
So you raged on some scumbag
for touching your blocks?

08:53.633 --> 08:54.699
It's Hillary, right?

08:54.701 --> 08:55.934
Mm-hmm.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.569
Go shut the door.

08:57.571 --> 08:58.637
Ugh!

09:01.774 --> 09:02.908
Where'd you go?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.912
Get your tires rotated?

09:10.183 --> 09:11.783
Stupid.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.719
So you're
a real go-getter, huh?

09:14.721 --> 09:19.157
You gonna roll me
over to the office, Mr. roboto?

09:19.159 --> 09:20.525
No...

09:20.527 --> 09:22.160
but I am gonna roll
all over you.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.730
Shut up, geekette!

09:26.800 --> 09:28.466
Don't you people
have anything better to do

09:28.468 --> 09:32.203
on a Saturday morning
than sit here with a cripple?

09:32.205 --> 09:33.772
Don't you have friends?

09:33.774 --> 09:35.307
The freak doesn't.

09:36.809 --> 09:38.476
Meet the only friend
i need, jocko.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.412
Bring me the knife, Mr. Boone.

09:41.747 --> 09:44.950
Why don't you come over here
and get it?

09:47.453 --> 09:48.653
Ugh.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.656
I hope you brought a spare tire.

10:42.608 --> 10:46.378
Seeing that you all have
an obvious learning disability,

10:46.380 --> 10:48.580
I'll write the rules
on the board.

10:51.917 --> 10:52.917
Oh!

10:56.523 --> 10:59.324
It hit him right in the face!

10:59.326 --> 11:00.525
Yes!

11:01.627 --> 11:02.827
Dumbass.

11:05.131 --> 11:07.465
- Oh, my god.
- Mister?

11:07.467 --> 11:09.567
Mr. roker, are you okay?

11:09.569 --> 11:11.236
Mister?

11:11.937 --> 11:13.371
Oh, shit.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.839
Is he breathing?

11:14.841 --> 11:16.474
Mr. roker?

11:16.476 --> 11:17.476
Shit.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.631
I think I hear him breathing.

11:39.633 --> 11:41.113
It's actually
more of a wheeze than...

11:41.735 --> 11:42.967
Shit!

11:42.969 --> 11:46.004
- Sh...
- You tried to kill me!

11:48.008 --> 11:49.941
You gook bastards!

11:54.047 --> 11:55.047
No!

11:56.049 --> 11:57.916
Let him go! No!

12:02.589 --> 12:03.888
Killer!

12:06.326 --> 12:08.126
Damnit, I'm not touching him!

12:08.128 --> 12:09.594
Rusty!

12:10.931 --> 12:12.130
Let him go!

12:14.700 --> 12:16.034
She just hit him!

12:23.443 --> 12:25.276
Thanks a lot, bimbette.

12:27.046 --> 12:29.080
I don't wanna touch you, dweeb!

12:36.589 --> 12:37.856
We got trouble.

12:38.457 --> 12:40.558
He's got trouble for sure.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.961
You think they're
gonna believe us,

12:42.963 --> 12:44.696
or a teacher in a wheelchair?

12:44.698 --> 12:46.898
They?
What do you mean by they?

12:46.900 --> 12:49.200
Police. Parents. Society?

12:49.202 --> 12:51.102
We just assaulted a teacher
as far as they're concerned.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.170
He said we tried to kill him.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.272
No, you assaulted the teacher.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.673
You tried to kill him!

12:55.675 --> 12:57.776
And we watched, asshole!

12:57.778 --> 13:00.779
It's called being
an ass-cessory, joystick.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.981
I'm not gonna get busted
for this.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.083
This is hellacious.

13:05.085 --> 13:10.021
My dad... will kill me for real

13:10.023 --> 13:12.357
if this messes with me
starting the next game.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.627
Don't have a cow.

13:16.328 --> 13:17.796
Let's tie him up.

13:17.798 --> 13:18.798
What?

13:19.732 --> 13:22.367
What? We can talk to him
when he catches snap.

13:25.204 --> 13:26.371
Uh...

13:28.007 --> 13:29.674
He tried to friggin' kill me.

13:30.342 --> 13:32.343
It's a fantastic idea.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.012
Where are we gonna
get rope from?

13:34.014 --> 13:35.547
Fine, okay...

13:36.315 --> 13:37.749
Yeah.

13:37.751 --> 13:39.484
They're boys,
they can do the rope stuff.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.953
I don't... it's not...
I'm just the idea person.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.454
Well, I was a girl scout.

13:44.423 --> 13:46.024
Let's go jocko, get some rope.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.379
So...

14:08.381 --> 14:09.814
What do we do now?

14:11.550 --> 14:14.052
Wait until he wakes up.
Reason with him.

14:16.489 --> 14:19.591
Did you hear that major
crazy shit he was talking?

14:19.593 --> 14:23.494
Man, we're all in more trouble
than I wanna even think about.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.864
Hell, I'm not even
supposed to be here.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.098
I'm the good kid.

14:27.100 --> 14:30.501
I ought to be home
working on my science project.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.036
Uh, just say no.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.705
I should be out
buying my prom dress.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.673
Instead I'm stuck here
with you posers.

14:35.675 --> 14:36.875
Can it, miss America.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.843
Everybody had something better
to do today.

14:38.845 --> 14:41.312
I could be out busting heads
on the field.

14:43.349 --> 14:45.183
I could be home right now.

14:46.986 --> 14:48.686
What would you be doing?

14:49.922 --> 14:50.922
Crimes.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.558
What was he yelling about,
anyway?

14:56.095 --> 14:57.662
Probably gibberish.

14:57.664 --> 15:00.398
I think part of it
was vietnamese.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.966
How the hell would you know?

15:03.202 --> 15:04.302
Uh, whatever.

15:05.237 --> 15:08.439
What's he doing
in that wheelchair anyway?

15:16.649 --> 15:18.449
Ladies! Come on!

15:18.451 --> 15:21.019
We need to figure out
what to do before he wakes up.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.254
Uh... too late.

15:28.460 --> 15:31.496
Uh... hi.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.266
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
It's just that...

15:35.268 --> 15:37.335
Do you remember what happened?

15:39.439 --> 15:41.339
Shelly's gonna take a look
at you.

15:42.408 --> 15:43.474
I don't want to.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.076
Do it...

15:45.078 --> 15:46.611
or I'll call the police myself.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.213
Okay, don't have a cow.
Just give me two seconds.

15:56.588 --> 15:59.223
What the hell are you doing?

16:04.130 --> 16:05.997
Hey!

16:05.999 --> 16:07.465
Hey!

16:07.467 --> 16:09.000
Just go!

16:11.104 --> 16:12.737
Shelly!

16:12.739 --> 16:15.039
I'm gathering my chi.

16:17.911 --> 16:20.111
If I watch this
am I gonna be a flamer?

16:20.113 --> 16:21.212
Yeah.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.119
Fuckin' do it already!

16:32.525 --> 16:35.960
- Okay.
- Come on! Do it!

16:43.135 --> 16:45.069
It's a little bruised.

16:45.071 --> 16:48.473
You have to press around it.
Gag me.

16:48.475 --> 16:49.874
Do you wanna do it?

16:56.382 --> 16:57.815
Are you okay?

17:00.152 --> 17:02.387
It hurts further back.

17:02.389 --> 17:03.821
Be careful.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.223
Further back.

17:19.003 --> 17:23.040
Oh, barf me out!
What is wrong with you?!

17:24.443 --> 17:25.609
Gross!

17:25.612 --> 17:27.111
You're a dick, man!

17:28.615 --> 17:31.182
- He bit me!
- You're in time out, speed racer.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.517
Get the door. Move!

17:33.920 --> 17:34.919
Come on!

17:34.921 --> 17:36.220
It's like shark teeth.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.455
God, you're heavy.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.597
Shut up!

17:46.965 --> 17:48.466
Stupid kids.

17:53.006 --> 17:54.872
Ah, ouch.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.143
It hurts.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.583
Okay.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.653
So now we add taking a hostage
to the list of offenses.

18:08.655 --> 18:11.255
Oh, it's "we" now?

18:11.257 --> 18:12.890
Yes, we.
We...

18:12.892 --> 18:14.325
Let's just figure this out!

18:18.797 --> 18:19.997
I've been thinking about this.

18:19.999 --> 18:21.499
Oh, here we go.

18:24.336 --> 18:26.003
The men are talking.

18:27.172 --> 18:28.439
We need to make sure
no one gets in here

18:28.441 --> 18:29.907
until we figure this shit out.

18:29.909 --> 18:32.477
We need to call the police.
We are totally innocent.

18:32.479 --> 18:33.911
They're not gonna believe us!

18:33.913 --> 18:36.747
At least not until Mr. roboto
comes to his senses.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.282
What's your big idea, then?

18:38.284 --> 18:40.251
We gotta lock down the school.

18:41.086 --> 18:42.587
Lock it down?

18:43.489 --> 18:45.256
No one can see him.
He's in the closet.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.358
What if somebody walks in
and he starts shouting?

18:47.360 --> 18:48.893
What then, huh?

18:48.895 --> 18:51.062
I can't believe this, but...

18:51.064 --> 18:53.998
i agree with a kid
that wears a leather jacket.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.433
Any volunteers?

18:56.902 --> 18:59.904
- Mm-mm.
- All right. Jocko, I guess we...

18:59.906 --> 19:03.474
Uh... I'll take Julie with me.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.109
You just watch that door.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.678
Fine.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.149
Hey, why don't you come up here
with me?

19:16.021 --> 19:18.890
I think he's gone insane.
What are we gonna do?

19:18.892 --> 19:21.359
Follow the plan.
Lock it down.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.895
Every door and window?
That's impossible.

19:23.897 --> 19:25.363
Nothing's impossible.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.032
Man, you are a mess.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.369
You're so pretty.

19:34.673 --> 19:35.973
You think they know?

19:37.809 --> 19:39.577
They would never...

19:43.982 --> 19:45.216
I love you.

19:45.684 --> 19:46.684
I love you too.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.520
Aw, young love.

19:51.057 --> 19:53.558
Kinda takes me back to my youth.

19:57.430 --> 20:00.932
'Scuse me.
You guys have a hall pass?

20:00.934 --> 20:03.201
- We really have to go...
- Yeah, we gotta go.

20:03.203 --> 20:06.370
Look, we just gotta go.
That's all.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.039
Kids of today.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.007
You just wonder what's
going through their minds.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.242
You know...

20:11.244 --> 20:12.977
Probably sex...

20:13.512 --> 20:15.346
more sex...

20:15.348 --> 20:16.847
sex again...

20:16.849 --> 20:18.082
Did I say sex?

20:18.084 --> 20:20.017
That's included: Sex.

21:27.020 --> 21:28.686
We can't let them catch on.

21:30.155 --> 21:32.223
Yeah, they'll rag us to death,
but...

21:33.225 --> 21:35.359
i don't really care
what anyone thinks.

21:35.361 --> 21:36.794
I do.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.297
You can't be seen
with an outcast like me.

21:39.299 --> 21:41.332
What if your dad...

22:04.156 --> 22:07.024
You two look like
you've been boinking.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.593
Ugh! Grotesque!

22:11.997 --> 22:13.597
Ha ha!

22:14.299 --> 22:16.867
Nobody's getting in here today.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.703
This place is locked down
like my offensive line.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.638
Boo bam!
- Ta-da!

22:20.640 --> 22:23.040
Mr roker's wallet, anyone?

22:31.083 --> 22:32.583
Look what we have here.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.852
Mr. roker's résumé.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.153
Mm...

22:36.155 --> 22:39.490
Couple of private
security contract jobs.

22:39.492 --> 22:42.059
Hm. No teaching jobs.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.401
Fucking queer!

22:50.403 --> 22:51.836
Veteran card.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.537
Couple of tours in Vietnam
I'll bet.

22:53.539 --> 22:55.940
That's where the gibberish
came from.

22:55.942 --> 22:57.408
Gnarly.

22:57.410 --> 22:59.143
Know what that card is?

22:59.711 --> 23:01.846
He was in black ops!

23:03.048 --> 23:04.615
What does that mean?

23:05.117 --> 23:06.784
Oh, Jesus Christ.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.955
That means he's a bad, bad man.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.592
I wanna call my parents.

23:15.427 --> 23:17.461
What if we just tell him
what we know?

23:18.397 --> 23:21.732
- Read it to him, outcast.
- What? Why me?

23:21.734 --> 23:23.033
I think the sound
of a woman's voice

23:23.035 --> 23:25.369
might rush the blood
from his head to his...

23:25.371 --> 23:26.537
What?

23:37.215 --> 23:39.750
Uh, Mr. roker,

23:39.752 --> 23:44.255
we know you were in
the, um, black ops.

23:44.257 --> 23:46.357
You were also in Vietnam.

23:46.359 --> 23:47.892
Do you remember?

23:49.227 --> 23:51.829
Mr. roker,
do you remember this?

23:51.831 --> 23:53.464
You think he's dead?

23:54.299 --> 23:56.000
There's only one way
to find out.

23:56.902 --> 23:58.335
We gotta open that door.

23:59.371 --> 24:00.905
Hey, hey, hang on a second!

24:04.976 --> 24:08.078
If he comes after us, man,
I'm totally gonna sack him.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.313
Fuckin' a.

24:12.985 --> 24:14.251
Come on.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.187
Watch out, Princess.

24:17.689 --> 24:19.190
Ready?
- Yeah, yeah.

24:19.192 --> 24:20.324
One...

24:21.393 --> 24:23.394
- Sorry.
- One...

24:23.862 --> 24:25.162
two...

24:25.797 --> 24:28.265
three!

24:28.267 --> 24:29.267
Shit.

24:29.935 --> 24:31.569
- Where's the beef?
- - Oh, my god, guys.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.137
What's wrong?

24:33.538 --> 24:35.272
What's it say?

24:35.274 --> 24:37.541
How did he climb up
and into the ceiling?

24:37.543 --> 24:39.577
- What's it say?
- - What's it say?

24:39.579 --> 24:42.546
"Game on. You die."

24:46.084 --> 24:47.585
Oh, my god.

25:09.241 --> 25:10.741
Is, uh...

25:11.343 --> 25:13.310
everything okay, there,

25:13.312 --> 25:15.312
mister, uh...

25:15.314 --> 25:17.081
- Roker.
- Roker.

25:19.084 --> 25:20.584
Um...

25:20.586 --> 25:21.886
I'm, uh...

25:22.420 --> 25:23.988
watching detention.

25:23.990 --> 25:25.789
I-i don't feel so well.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.558
What's the matter, buddy?

25:27.560 --> 25:29.326
I'm not sure. I know...

25:30.729 --> 25:32.730
i threw up...

25:32.732 --> 25:36.700
I... wonder if I could
borrow a mop.

25:36.702 --> 25:39.737
I got plenty of mops here,
but...

25:39.739 --> 25:41.438
it's my job to clean up.

25:43.241 --> 25:45.609
I can see you're eating.

25:45.611 --> 25:46.810
Hey, I...

25:47.245 --> 25:48.679
I won't tell.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.415
Very considerate of you.

25:52.584 --> 25:54.518
Don't wanna take your job...

25:58.223 --> 26:00.791
but I will take your life!

26:34.993 --> 26:36.327
Little bubbly?

26:36.329 --> 26:38.195
Huh? Huh?

26:38.197 --> 26:40.864
Drink it down.
There you go!

27:16.267 --> 27:17.534
I wanna go home!

27:18.503 --> 27:20.471
The pigs are gonna be
all over me for this,

27:20.473 --> 27:22.539
and I ain't going down alone!

27:23.675 --> 27:25.809
I guess the mall maggot is
going to sit there and bawl?

27:25.811 --> 27:27.378
Why don't you just
leave her alone?

27:27.380 --> 27:28.779
I'm tired of you
opening your mouth...

27:28.781 --> 27:31.382
- nobody was talking to you, outcast.
- I'm talking to you.

27:31.384 --> 27:33.484
I'm not an outcast!
- Why don't you turn your head...

27:33.486 --> 27:35.886
- I'm not gonna turn around. - ...And
cut yourself a little bit, huh?

27:35.888 --> 27:38.122
It's none of your concern,
so shut up!

27:38.124 --> 27:40.457
Oh, you don't talk all year and now you
are gonna turn around and bitch at me?

27:40.459 --> 27:41.892
I'm gonna bitch at you
all I want!

27:41.894 --> 27:44.194
Let's not be afraid.

27:44.196 --> 27:46.764
Fear is the mind killer.

27:48.267 --> 27:52.503
Fear is the little-death
that brings total obliteration.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.539
Just let her go with it, man.

27:56.408 --> 27:58.008
And when it has gone past,

27:58.010 --> 28:02.713
I will turn the inner eye
to see its path.

28:02.715 --> 28:06.717
Where the fear has gone...
There will be nothing.

28:06.719 --> 28:09.153
Only I will remain!

28:09.688 --> 28:13.090
Wow. Righteous speech.

28:20.999 --> 28:23.967
I knew reading "dune" would
come in handy at some point.

28:35.781 --> 28:38.716
Is that blood on your head?

28:38.718 --> 28:40.451
I don't think
i can take it anymore.

28:40.453 --> 28:41.919
Take what anymore?

28:41.921 --> 28:44.855
War, you gook!

28:47.259 --> 28:50.728
You and your kind followed us
for three days in the bush

28:50.730 --> 28:53.130
while we were trying to find
the rest of our company.

28:57.368 --> 28:58.936
Listen!

29:00.205 --> 29:02.940
You are going to listen.

29:05.877 --> 29:07.611
We found evidence of 'em.

29:11.216 --> 29:13.150
Our provisions were running low.

29:13.152 --> 29:15.486
Some of the men turned to...

29:20.992 --> 29:23.026
You know what I mean!

29:25.430 --> 29:27.564
You commanded your...

29:27.566 --> 29:31.401
little yellow bastards
to kill them, and...

29:45.850 --> 29:48.385
It all started
when we ran across this...

29:49.287 --> 29:51.421
this little village...

29:51.423 --> 29:53.590
that had been napalmed
hours before.

29:55.527 --> 29:58.395
For miles it was all
anyone could talk about.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.399
That smell...

30:04.502 --> 30:06.336
It was enough to drive
some of the...

30:06.338 --> 30:08.272
weaker mean insane.

30:11.609 --> 30:13.277
One of my men...

30:15.013 --> 30:18.849
rushed up...
To a smoldering body...

30:21.319 --> 30:23.921
didn't hesitate for a second...

30:23.923 --> 30:26.056
After that it was a frenzy.

30:27.158 --> 30:30.794
I'm not finished...

30:30.796 --> 30:31.962
general.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.504
When we got back to base...

30:40.506 --> 30:42.472
some of the men were arrested.

30:45.577 --> 30:48.078
They were found
cooking human flesh.

30:53.751 --> 30:55.552
Oh, I don't have to tell you...

30:57.323 --> 30:58.622
taste.

31:04.629 --> 31:05.963
It was in 'em...

31:10.034 --> 31:11.835
It was in 'em, all right.

31:12.604 --> 31:15.272
Like their conscience laid bare.

31:17.308 --> 31:20.177
I have walked through the valley

31:20.179 --> 31:22.412
of the shadow of death!

31:23.081 --> 31:25.015
And it smelled...

31:25.884 --> 31:27.751
delicious!

31:34.425 --> 31:37.094
You're gonna tell me
where my men are, general...

31:38.730 --> 31:39.930
now.

31:40.698 --> 31:42.733
Let's hunt
that mental fuck down.

31:42.735 --> 31:45.535
Yes! Yes!

31:45.537 --> 31:47.938
He wants blood?
Let's give it to him, man.

31:49.374 --> 31:50.908
Fuck yes!

31:55.848 --> 31:57.681
<i>Attention, students.</i>

31:57.683 --> 32:00.450
<i>All of you little brats
are gonna pay.</i>

32:00.452 --> 32:02.753
<i>I'll be wearing your ears
as a necklace</i>

32:02.755 --> 32:04.755
<i>before the final bell.</i>

32:04.757 --> 32:06.757
<i>That is all.</i>

32:06.759 --> 32:08.692
Let's get out of here!

32:08.694 --> 32:10.627
Come on, come on, guys.
No fake.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.296
We have to go...
- hey, hey, hey!

32:12.298 --> 32:13.830
Chill out.
All right?

32:13.832 --> 32:17.200
We just gotta make sure lieutenant
lunatic doesn't get in here.

32:17.202 --> 32:19.736
We have to find something
to block the doors.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.338
Duh!

32:21.340 --> 32:22.506
Let's go!

32:24.610 --> 32:25.575
Get the cabinet!

32:25.577 --> 32:27.077
Forget the cabinet!
Move the trash can!

32:27.079 --> 32:28.979
That's never gonna hold, moron!

32:28.981 --> 32:30.347
Shut up!

32:31.482 --> 32:33.650
That has wheels, asshole!

32:33.652 --> 32:35.352
- Hit me again.
- Get the goddamn...

32:35.354 --> 32:37.087
Hit me again, bro!

32:37.089 --> 32:38.789
Come on! Come on!

32:38.791 --> 32:40.490
Come on! Come on! Come on!

32:47.098 --> 32:48.865
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:50.134 --> 32:52.836
How's that?
Mega-touchdown!

32:52.838 --> 32:54.838
Just what we needed he-man!

32:54.840 --> 32:57.841
Ow... ow...
Just kidding! You suck!

32:59.644 --> 33:01.478
How are we supposed to get out?

33:01.480 --> 33:02.446
As long as he can't get in,

33:02.448 --> 33:04.348
I don't give a shit
about getting out.

33:06.017 --> 33:08.251
I am not your b.F.F.

33:26.537 --> 33:27.537
Ah!

33:28.339 --> 33:29.539
I can get it for you.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.675
I can get you all the money
that you need.

33:31.677 --> 33:34.011
I don't care
about those little brats.

33:34.013 --> 33:35.645
Just let me go.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.414
Let me go!

33:38.684 --> 33:41.018
Promises, promises!

33:41.020 --> 33:42.219
Hey!

33:58.270 --> 33:59.936
Could use a smoke.

34:02.206 --> 34:03.707
Hey, you can't smoke that
in here.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.942
You have to go
to the smoking area.

34:05.944 --> 34:07.177
Get real.

34:07.179 --> 34:10.080
I think that is the least
of our problems.

34:10.081 --> 34:12.181
You smoke dicks, I smoke cigs.

34:12.184 --> 34:13.516
Ha!

34:13.918 --> 34:14.951
You want one?

34:14.953 --> 34:17.020
I want to get out of here.

34:18.023 --> 34:20.623
You've made that
abundantly clear.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.525
Ooh, abundantly, huh?

34:25.563 --> 34:27.330
I could be like you...

34:27.331 --> 34:29.166
if I wanted to.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.034
Yeah, right.

34:31.036 --> 34:32.735
What's your score on your sats?

34:33.972 --> 34:35.672
A lot.

34:38.443 --> 34:39.976
I bet mine was higher.

34:39.978 --> 34:42.212
Bet you were just high
when you took it.

34:43.782 --> 34:46.283
- He was. I was there.
- Come on. Humor me.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.754
1420.

34:55.560 --> 34:56.860
That's pretty good.

34:58.229 --> 35:00.397
Yes? So?

35:00.399 --> 35:02.132
Why don't you humor us?

35:04.635 --> 35:05.936
1500.

35:07.739 --> 35:08.939
Bullshit!

35:08.941 --> 35:10.941
Bullshit, and I'm calling
you out right now.

35:10.943 --> 35:12.309
Whatever.

35:16.147 --> 35:17.147
Ah!

35:17.448 --> 35:18.949
What are we betting?

35:18.951 --> 35:21.151
What? Nothing.

35:22.587 --> 35:24.855
How 'bout the Princess
let's me French her?

35:27.825 --> 35:31.161
And if I win, you have to apologize
to all of us for being rude!

35:31.163 --> 35:32.562
Yes!

35:32.564 --> 35:35.332
If you scored a 1500 on the sat,

35:35.334 --> 35:36.533
I'll let you bag me.

35:49.780 --> 35:52.449
No way! No way!
Let me see that shit!

35:54.919 --> 35:58.321
Fuckin' a, dude!
Are you serious?

35:58.323 --> 36:00.423
You want some gum, Princess?

36:01.459 --> 36:02.626
Damn!

36:03.661 --> 36:07.330
So, do you want
some privacy, or...?

36:07.332 --> 36:09.399
Let's just get this over with.

36:10.635 --> 36:13.270
This is actually happening
right now.

36:13.272 --> 36:15.972
You said anything I wanted.

36:15.974 --> 36:18.008
You're not a liar are you?
- Fine.

36:21.345 --> 36:25.215
Texas thunder light
would make this a lot easier.

36:25.217 --> 36:27.350
Yeah, let's get some privacy.

36:30.321 --> 36:33.056
- How is this happening?
- Later days and better days, suckers!

36:33.058 --> 36:34.291
What?!

36:35.092 --> 36:36.860
What does that even mean?

36:40.765 --> 36:42.699
Oh, oh my god.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.467
Is it safe in here?

36:46.370 --> 36:48.605
Listen if you're scared...
We don't have to do this.

36:52.643 --> 36:54.778
You think you're so
bad to the bone.

36:59.617 --> 37:01.451
I think it's bogus.

37:13.030 --> 37:14.965
Preppy girls do it best.

37:14.967 --> 37:16.199
Say it.

37:16.201 --> 37:17.334
Prove it.

37:25.443 --> 37:27.210
This has been brewing
a long time.

37:29.014 --> 37:30.513
Get real.

37:30.915 --> 37:32.315
Get bent.

37:41.459 --> 37:43.126
Just between us?

37:43.128 --> 37:44.394
Oh, yeah.

38:09.588 --> 38:12.922
Principals don't belong here
on Saturday!

38:27.172 --> 38:29.339
That should bleed you out
soon enough.

38:39.216 --> 38:43.019
Listen, this is
a long time coming.

38:43.021 --> 38:44.554
To be continued?

38:44.556 --> 38:46.222
In your dreams.

38:47.124 --> 38:48.325
Tease.

38:49.093 --> 38:50.794
There's somethin'
out there, man.

38:50.796 --> 38:52.262
Let's go check it out.

38:57.968 --> 38:59.469
Rusty, let's go!

39:03.674 --> 39:05.241
Shit, dude, you see that?

39:09.981 --> 39:12.048
Oh, shit! Oh, my god!

39:12.050 --> 39:13.383
Close it!

39:13.385 --> 39:14.551
Fuck dude!
- Shit, shit.

39:14.553 --> 39:16.853
- That's janitor Dan!
- Dude, that's fucked up, man!

39:16.855 --> 39:17.855
That guy was cool!

39:19.891 --> 39:21.991
Let's go tell the girls.
Let's go.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.832
Okay,

39:28.834 --> 39:30.834
he is officially batshit
to the Max!

39:30.836 --> 39:33.169
He butchered janitor Dan!

39:33.171 --> 39:35.205
My balls are in my throat, man,

39:35.207 --> 39:36.906
and that tells me we gotta
get the shit out of here.

39:36.908 --> 39:38.108
Can we go home now?

39:38.110 --> 39:40.009
I'm with her!
Let's bail!

39:40.011 --> 39:42.011
- Yes!
- Guys, this is not a good idea!

39:42.013 --> 39:43.880
I have a very bad feeling
about this.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.148
Guys!

39:45.683 --> 39:47.884
Let's stick together.

39:59.164 --> 40:01.631
God, please!
Somebody help us!

40:03.502 --> 40:05.402
Hillary, you can't do this.

40:05.404 --> 40:07.537
We gotta chill and keep moving.
Come on!

40:07.539 --> 40:09.773
It doesn't matter.
We're all going to die anyway.

40:09.775 --> 40:12.609
We will if you don't get up
off your ass!

40:12.611 --> 40:14.210
Oh, shit! Boogie!

40:21.453 --> 40:22.852
Guys!

40:55.820 --> 40:57.287
Damn! You're bohunk, man!

40:57.289 --> 40:59.856
We didn't do all this!

40:59.858 --> 41:01.191
Who, then?

41:01.759 --> 41:04.027
My guess is g.I. Joker.

41:06.163 --> 41:07.730
Hey, where's Julie?

41:09.266 --> 41:12.135
- Julie?
- Julie! Where's Julie, man?!

41:12.137 --> 41:13.503
- Wait, wait!
- Come back!

41:13.505 --> 41:15.405
Wait! No, no!

41:22.781 --> 41:24.447
Oh, god...

41:25.015 --> 41:27.617
Ah...

42:00.985 --> 42:03.186
How could we just leave her?

42:03.188 --> 42:05.321
I can't! I can't!
I gotta go back!

42:05.323 --> 42:06.556
Mike!

42:06.558 --> 42:08.224
Ain't happening, bro.

42:08.226 --> 42:10.727
We gotta stick together.

42:10.729 --> 42:12.862
Nobody said "we", wuss!

42:12.864 --> 42:14.430
Wait, wait! Wait!

42:14.432 --> 42:15.832
No!

42:15.834 --> 42:17.133
We're sticking together.

42:23.607 --> 42:24.807
Fuck.

42:26.076 --> 42:27.544
Julie?

42:52.103 --> 42:53.303
Julie?

43:07.586 --> 43:10.453
Mike, I'm in here! Mike!

43:13.157 --> 43:14.390
Julie?

43:18.996 --> 43:22.031
So... here we are.

43:25.703 --> 43:27.136
Where is she?

43:27.138 --> 43:29.539
Wouldn't you like to know?

43:29.541 --> 43:31.007
Mike!

43:32.776 --> 43:34.744
Why don't you go see
if she's okay?!

43:34.746 --> 43:36.346
Man, why don't you go
fuck yourself?

43:36.348 --> 43:38.348
Aah!

43:38.350 --> 43:40.149
Soldiers today...

43:40.151 --> 43:42.085
No respect for the enemy!

43:46.891 --> 43:48.858
Oh! Oh!

43:49.426 --> 43:52.261
Oh!

43:52.263 --> 43:53.963
Where'd the tough guy go?

43:53.965 --> 43:55.164
Huh?

43:58.302 --> 43:59.969
Mike!

44:03.007 --> 44:05.108
Mike, I'm in here! Mike!

44:10.180 --> 44:11.948
Thank you, sir.

44:11.950 --> 44:13.449
May I have another?

44:13.451 --> 44:14.584
Mike!

44:25.230 --> 44:26.663
Mike!

44:26.665 --> 44:27.764
Are you okay?

44:27.766 --> 44:29.632
I see the breadcrumbs worked.

44:29.634 --> 44:31.701
Big ol' honkin' breadcrumbs.

44:31.703 --> 44:33.036
Come on let's
get you outta here.

44:33.038 --> 44:35.672
- No! No, no, no!

44:35.674 --> 44:37.240
Somebody help!

44:37.242 --> 44:39.275
Somebody help me!

44:41.880 --> 44:44.147
Mike, please!
Mike, I love you!

44:44.149 --> 44:46.149
Mike, please!

44:46.151 --> 44:48.384
Mike! Mike!

44:48.386 --> 44:51.554
Oh, my god! Why?!

44:51.556 --> 44:55.725
Why?! Why, why, why, why?!

45:05.769 --> 45:08.271
No guts, no glory!

45:09.774 --> 45:11.441
Right, little man?!

45:12.710 --> 45:14.677
You're not half bad, now!

45:54.885 --> 45:56.719
I'm sorry, Julie.

45:59.923 --> 46:03.025
Look the only way we're
gonna getting out of here...

46:03.027 --> 46:06.395
is if we kill roker.
We-we know that right?

46:08.966 --> 46:11.667
We see what rushing away
from the group gets us.

46:14.805 --> 46:16.405
He saved my life.

46:16.407 --> 46:17.840
And lost his.

46:23.114 --> 46:25.414
Look, we all have skills.

46:25.416 --> 46:27.316
We need to use them.

46:28.753 --> 46:30.319
You are smart.

46:31.088 --> 46:32.855
He's strong.

46:33.457 --> 46:36.526
Hillary is... well...

46:36.528 --> 46:39.162
Hillary is a gymnast,
captain of the cheer squad

46:39.164 --> 46:41.164
and a black belt in tae Kwon do.

46:44.902 --> 46:46.435
What's your skill, Julie?

46:46.437 --> 46:48.404
My skills are bogus.

46:48.406 --> 46:51.340
All I know is we need
to get the hell out of here...

46:51.342 --> 46:53.409
and the only way
is over Mr. roker's dead body.

46:53.411 --> 46:56.345
I am a cheerleader.
I'm not gonna kill anyone!

46:56.347 --> 46:58.347
I'm gonna to call the police!

46:59.316 --> 47:01.751
The only phone
is in the principal's office.

47:01.753 --> 47:04.153
What about the fire alarms,
did you ever think of that?

47:04.155 --> 47:05.655
I didn't think so.

47:05.657 --> 47:08.024
Hillary, chill out, all right?
We gotta wait.

47:08.026 --> 47:09.625
- Hillary!
- Hillary!

47:09.627 --> 47:11.494
- Hillary!
- Hillary!

47:11.496 --> 47:13.162
Hey! Hillary!

47:13.164 --> 47:14.664
Yo, rusty.

47:14.666 --> 47:16.933
We need a plan, okay?

47:16.935 --> 47:20.036
You've got one minute to plan
before I go after her.

47:20.038 --> 47:21.604
You know this is crazy.

47:21.606 --> 47:22.872
I'd do it for you, too, Julie.

47:22.874 --> 47:25.908
You just can't go on a wing
and a prayer.

47:26.910 --> 47:29.445
If that's all I got...
It's righteous.

47:31.182 --> 47:35.117
Rusty! Rusty, no!
Rusty!

47:54.872 --> 47:57.306
He's the only guy that really
ever cared about me.

47:58.942 --> 48:01.777
I loved him so much.

48:08.552 --> 48:10.319
He wanted to tell everybody.

48:11.154 --> 48:13.122
That was the kind of guy he was.

48:14.358 --> 48:17.860
But if his dad ever found out
he was dating someone like me,

48:17.862 --> 48:19.729
a freak,

48:19.731 --> 48:21.197
he would've killed him.

48:25.135 --> 48:26.736
And now he's dead

48:26.738 --> 48:30.206
and I have to go into the world and
pretend like i never knew him.

48:30.208 --> 48:32.475
Like I never fucking knew him.

48:47.357 --> 48:49.058
Bite me!

48:53.463 --> 48:54.830
Gross me out!

48:57.068 --> 48:58.134
Ew.

49:02.940 --> 49:04.707
Oh, oh!

49:05.742 --> 49:08.444
Chuh, like, what am I, a hacker?

49:10.448 --> 49:12.248
Shelly will know
how to use this.

49:12.250 --> 49:13.849
Ew.

49:22.759 --> 49:26.729
How did you get so far out
in the back country?

49:26.731 --> 49:27.763
Hmm?

49:30.468 --> 49:32.501
You are so kirked out!

49:32.503 --> 49:34.303
What's a pretty little thing
like you doing

49:34.305 --> 49:36.172
conniving with the enemy?

49:40.678 --> 49:42.211
You won't get all of us,
you know.

49:42.213 --> 49:44.313
Somebody's gonna get out
and when they do,

49:44.315 --> 49:45.681
you're going down.

49:45.683 --> 49:47.183
Oh.

49:47.185 --> 49:49.986
What's daddy's little girl
gonna do now?

49:49.988 --> 49:53.689
Daddy's little girl is gonna
party Hardy on your ass!

50:03.200 --> 50:04.600
Roker!

50:12.142 --> 50:14.810
Not bad for a squaw.

50:15.846 --> 50:17.880
You're messing with
the spirit club now, loser.

50:25.622 --> 50:27.790
Ow! Gag me.

50:38.368 --> 50:39.969
Die, slant-eye.

50:45.977 --> 50:47.610
Hillary!

50:56.820 --> 50:58.687
Ah! Fuck!

50:59.990 --> 51:01.490
Hillary!

51:06.730 --> 51:08.531
Hillary!

51:09.966 --> 51:11.133
Where could she be?

51:18.408 --> 51:19.875
Hillary!

51:34.391 --> 51:36.859
I just can't let rusty
be alone like that.

51:38.395 --> 51:39.862
Like me.

51:41.298 --> 51:43.332
S-stay here.

51:43.334 --> 51:44.567
Not a problem.

51:49.172 --> 51:50.506
I'll be back.

52:22.139 --> 52:23.139
No, no.

52:46.196 --> 52:47.563
No, no.

53:02.679 --> 53:07.316
You showed me something today
that... I never knew existed.

53:11.521 --> 53:14.857
That son of a bitch!

53:25.936 --> 53:27.169
Rusty?

53:27.771 --> 53:28.804
He killed her.

53:32.175 --> 53:34.176
I wanna kill the fucker.

53:34.178 --> 53:37.146
Rusty, we have to go.

53:40.951 --> 53:43.285
That son of a bitch!

53:52.529 --> 53:54.163
Good bye, Hillary.

53:55.365 --> 53:56.832
I'll never forget.

53:56.834 --> 53:59.268
Preppy girls do it best.

54:11.681 --> 54:13.182
Rusty!

54:13.184 --> 54:14.917
We gotta go!
Come on!

54:17.587 --> 54:19.888
Come on! Let's go!

54:59.462 --> 55:00.763
What happened?

55:06.836 --> 55:08.237
Hillary's dead.

55:35.465 --> 55:38.000
You know earlier, when...

55:38.002 --> 55:40.102
she was saying that she
wanted to be out

55:40.104 --> 55:42.404
shopping for her prom dress?

55:44.207 --> 55:46.141
I thought "how typical..."

55:48.078 --> 55:51.980
"Princess wants to go
shopping for a prom dress."

55:51.982 --> 55:53.749
Why do we do that?

55:54.651 --> 55:56.251
Why do we have these...

55:57.120 --> 56:00.222
misconceived ideas
of one another?

56:03.093 --> 56:04.360
If this wouldn't have happened,

56:04.362 --> 56:07.296
then we wouldn't
be talking like this.

56:10.133 --> 56:12.735
I don't want
to be like that anymore.

56:17.574 --> 56:19.308
Me neither.

56:20.510 --> 56:22.845
So, how the hell
do we kill the psycho?

56:26.883 --> 56:28.250
Any ideas?

56:31.187 --> 56:33.522
We have to find something
to arm ourselves with.

56:48.538 --> 56:50.072
I got this.

56:51.941 --> 56:53.108
Julie...

56:56.446 --> 56:57.980
What do you got, Shelly?

56:59.616 --> 57:00.849
Uh...

57:09.759 --> 57:12.027
Let's go get this fucker.

57:12.029 --> 57:13.029
Let's go.

57:40.458 --> 57:41.657
Who goes there?

57:45.195 --> 57:46.428
Rusty?

57:49.399 --> 57:50.532
Julie?

57:56.439 --> 57:57.873
I said...

57:57.875 --> 57:59.508
who goes there?!

58:00.643 --> 58:01.977
Shh!

58:01.979 --> 58:03.679
Why didn't you answer me?!

58:03.681 --> 58:05.347
Shut the fuck up.

58:05.349 --> 58:07.950
We're supposed to keep our
location secret, ass munch.

58:07.952 --> 58:09.818
Let go of my shirt.

58:09.820 --> 58:12.521
Well then stop being
such a chicken shit!

58:12.523 --> 58:13.956
Deadweight.

58:14.657 --> 58:16.925
I'm not a chickenshit.

58:16.927 --> 58:19.094
Not even scared.

58:19.629 --> 58:21.063
Come on guys.

58:22.665 --> 58:24.933
We have to stick together
or we're dead.

58:26.803 --> 58:28.070
Okay?

58:29.639 --> 58:31.273
Are we good?

58:31.275 --> 58:33.509
He needs to apologize
for his last remark.

58:35.112 --> 58:36.478
All right, shit.

58:36.480 --> 58:38.180
You're not a deadweight.

58:38.182 --> 58:39.515
Hmm.

58:39.517 --> 58:42.751
And apologize for my shirt.

58:46.789 --> 58:49.424
All right. I'm sorry
i messed up your shirt.

58:49.426 --> 58:51.460
I'm sure your grandpa
would be mondo-pouty

58:51.462 --> 58:53.095
I wrinkled his shirt.

59:04.440 --> 59:06.575
Hey. Hey, Julie!

59:06.577 --> 59:08.110
Hey, Julie, where you going?!

59:08.112 --> 59:10.712
Julie, come back!
I'm sorry!

59:10.714 --> 59:13.482
Rusty and I,
we're-we're fine now.

59:13.484 --> 59:16.151
Look! We took
a major chill pill, all right?

59:20.723 --> 59:22.858
This is how this is gonna go.

59:22.860 --> 59:24.960
You, stop with your whining
and get on with your traps.

59:24.962 --> 59:27.229
And you, stop with
your third grade crap

59:27.231 --> 59:28.897
and get onto that hallway
and guard it.

59:28.899 --> 59:30.999
I'm gonna take the other end.

59:31.001 --> 59:32.935
If we don't stick together
we're gonna be...

59:32.937 --> 59:35.971
frickin' road pizza
by the end of the night.

59:43.613 --> 59:44.713
Shelly, you have fifteen minutes

59:44.715 --> 59:46.715
to come up
with something spectacular.

59:47.717 --> 59:49.284
Amaze me.

01:00:11.007 --> 01:00:12.975
All right it's all clear.

01:00:12.977 --> 01:00:15.410
Oh shit! What is that?

01:00:16.579 --> 01:00:19.114
It's a compound I made using
general household products,

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:20.482
we should set it up
in every hallway

01:00:20.484 --> 01:00:22.417
and if he tries to get us
we can throw it on him.

01:00:22.419 --> 01:00:24.086
It'll neutralize him.

01:00:24.088 --> 01:00:25.554
All right cool, but we're gonna
need more buckets

01:00:25.556 --> 01:00:27.089
to put at the end
of each hallway.

01:00:27.091 --> 01:00:28.890
Hand me that rat poison.

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:33.328
Go get those buckets.

01:00:38.334 --> 01:00:39.635
Hey, Shelly.

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:55.410
Henderson...

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:03.151
You're gonna be all right.

01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:08.990
It'll be okay.

01:02:12.695 --> 01:02:14.896
I just need to... take a look.

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:33.482
What?

01:03:06.249 --> 01:03:08.583
Let's hunt this bastard down!

01:03:10.753 --> 01:03:13.288
Our best bet is to drive him
into one of the traps.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:15.957
What? We'll have to split up
to do that.

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:17.425
She's right.

01:03:17.427 --> 01:03:20.495
We're gonna have to come at
this asshole from all sides.

01:03:20.497 --> 01:03:22.364
It's do or die time, shel.

01:03:32.842 --> 01:03:35.076
Let's crush this fly!

01:03:35.078 --> 01:03:37.345
For Mike, for Hillary.

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:57.332
Roker!

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:21.590
Here, let me help you with that.

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.204
Shh.

01:04:56.659 --> 01:04:58.226
Better run, Poindexter!

01:04:58.228 --> 01:05:00.595
I'll have your goddamn heart
on a platter!

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.468
Run!

01:05:15.244 --> 01:05:16.478
<i>Test.</i>

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.647
<i>Aah! That's better!</i>

01:05:24.588 --> 01:05:26.288
I'm looking at you, little lady!

01:05:27.323 --> 01:05:29.024
<i>Uh, this one goes out</i>

01:05:29.026 --> 01:05:33.595
<i>to all you spoiled little
pieces of shit out there.</i>

01:05:33.597 --> 01:05:36.231
<i>New wave, baby!</i>

01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:43.672
Don't be such a spaz!

01:05:58.255 --> 01:05:59.587
Whatever.

01:06:17.273 --> 01:06:20.342
Please... no.

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.745
I'll do anything.

01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:27.282
You're not giving up now,
are you?

01:06:27.284 --> 01:06:28.583
Bud?!

01:06:29.618 --> 01:06:32.354
We didn't do anything!

01:06:32.356 --> 01:06:34.289
Come on, soldier!

01:06:35.458 --> 01:06:37.359
There's no use
crying about it now.

01:06:45.635 --> 01:06:47.736
Hey, slant-eye!

01:06:47.738 --> 01:06:49.337
On second thought...

01:06:51.774 --> 01:06:53.208
Let's jam.

01:06:57.514 --> 01:06:59.881
Oh, you little... bitch.

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:04.919
Score!

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:13.261
You really got your head
in the game.

01:07:14.764 --> 01:07:16.197
Nighty night.

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:55.470
You bitch!
What did you throw on me?!

01:07:55.472 --> 01:07:57.405
Oh, god!

01:08:00.477 --> 01:08:01.609
Die!

01:08:13.623 --> 01:08:14.989
It's over?

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:20.528
It's over.

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:22.964
That's all it took?

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:26.768
That's all it took?!

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:31.305
That's all it took?
That's all it took, asshole?

01:08:31.308 --> 01:08:33.475
That's all it took?
That's all it took?!

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:35.910
Oh, shit!

01:08:35.912 --> 01:08:37.345
I'm outta here, asshole!

01:08:38.546 --> 01:08:40.448
You need to watch
your language, young lady.

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:45.854
Hey!

01:08:48.189 --> 01:08:50.925
You're gonna end up with
another detention next week!

01:09:39.109 --> 01:09:40.808
<i>Attention, student.</i>

01:09:40.810 --> 01:09:42.743
<i>I'm coming for you.</i>

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:45.313
<i>I can hear you, Julie.</i>

01:09:47.483 --> 01:09:50.151
You crazy son of a bitch!

01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:52.620
What is wrong with you?!

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:55.423
All we wanted to do
was get out of here,

01:09:55.425 --> 01:09:57.492
but you wouldn't let us!

01:09:58.394 --> 01:10:01.963
And now I'm stuck here.
Nowhere to run.

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:08.002
<i>Time to die, Julie.</i>

01:10:08.004 --> 01:10:09.637
<i>That is all.</i>

01:10:20.115 --> 01:10:21.783
You know earlier, when...

01:10:22.685 --> 01:10:24.719
she was saying she wanted
to be out

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:26.854
shopping for her prom dress?

01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:30.024
<i>"I thought," how typical...</i>

01:10:30.026 --> 01:10:32.760
<i>Princess wants to go
shopping for a prom dress.</i>

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:34.162
<i>Why do we do that?</i>

01:10:34.164 --> 01:10:36.397
<i>Why do we have these...</i>

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:39.934
<i>misconceived ideas
of one another?</i>

01:10:39.936 --> 01:10:41.236
<i>If this wouldn't have happened,</i>

01:10:41.238 --> 01:10:44.305
<i>then we wouldn't be
talking like this.</i>

01:10:44.307 --> 01:10:46.474
I don't wanna
be like that anymore.

01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:49.510
I'm not gonna do this anymore.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.034
Julie!

01:11:47.369 --> 01:11:48.703
I smell you.

01:11:52.675 --> 01:11:54.342
I smell you!

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:58.112
Where are you, you bitch?

01:11:58.114 --> 01:11:59.414
Huh?

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:02.583
You're in my jungle now.

01:12:03.786 --> 01:12:04.952
Understand?

01:12:06.455 --> 01:12:08.990
I'm gonna fuckin' devour you.

01:12:08.992 --> 01:12:11.059
You dink bitch!

01:12:12.094 --> 01:12:14.028
What you did to me...

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:19.233
That was mind control!

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:22.136
Julie!

01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:24.706
Hear that?!

01:12:25.942 --> 01:12:27.775
It is the sound of nothing.

01:12:27.777 --> 01:12:30.511
No chopper's coming for you!

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:31.946
You're in my jungle.

01:12:32.548 --> 01:12:33.548
My jungle!

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:38.286
You don't get to
outta here, bitch.

01:12:38.288 --> 01:12:39.787
Oh!

01:12:39.789 --> 01:12:43.224
Oh, my boyfriend Mike is dead!

01:12:47.263 --> 01:12:50.565
He cut him in half!

01:12:51.834 --> 01:12:55.036
That's nothing compared
to what I'll do to you!

01:12:57.674 --> 01:12:59.474
I'm gonna end you.

01:13:00.275 --> 01:13:03.077
After what you did to me
and my men!

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:06.347
They were my men!

01:13:06.349 --> 01:13:07.915
Good men!

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:12.954
I'm gonna wear your ears
for a necklace.

01:13:14.656 --> 01:13:18.893
I've got some 556
for your fucking teeth...

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:21.929
and then I'll devour them
and shit 'em out...

01:13:21.931 --> 01:13:24.499
on your cold fucking corpse!

01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:26.567
You understand me?!

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:28.236
You dink!

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:31.272
I'm gonna take my blade...

01:13:31.274 --> 01:13:34.542
and I'm gonna bury it
deep into you, you bitch...

01:13:34.544 --> 01:13:36.944
like I did
to your boyfriend, Mike!

01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:44.952
Thieves, the dinks...

01:13:44.954 --> 01:13:46.687
I'm comin' for you!

01:14:25.427 --> 01:14:26.661
Shit.

01:14:34.036 --> 01:14:35.503
Oh, my god.

01:14:37.674 --> 01:14:38.739
Where?!

01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:40.875
I can't see.

01:14:45.647 --> 01:14:47.648
Where are you?!

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:50.485
There you are, slant-eye!

01:14:50.487 --> 01:14:51.953
As if!

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:56.691
Well, since we are up here...

01:14:57.659 --> 01:15:00.328
let's have a little lesson
in gravity.

01:15:02.398 --> 01:15:04.899
Why are you doing this?!

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:17.612
Get back here!

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:27.154
For all my men
lost to the likes of you!

01:15:27.156 --> 01:15:28.890
We're just kids!

01:15:28.892 --> 01:15:30.091
Scum!

01:15:30.093 --> 01:15:32.460
It's 1983!

01:15:33.328 --> 01:15:34.562
They're all gone now.

01:15:34.564 --> 01:15:37.365
I'm just a kid!
Please! Please!

01:15:37.367 --> 01:15:40.334

Ghosts!

01:16:01.423 --> 01:16:02.790
Please...

01:16:05.994 --> 01:16:07.428
Please!

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:09.964
No, no, no!

01:16:10.699 --> 01:16:13.634
I live surrounded by ghosts!

01:16:14.837 --> 01:16:17.104
No! No!

01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:28.215
Help!

01:16:28.217 --> 01:16:29.483
Help me!

01:16:29.985 --> 01:16:31.886
Little girl?

01:16:31.888 --> 01:16:33.521
Please.

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:36.390
No.

01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:39.760
I'm an American hero.

01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:43.297
Why did you do it?
Why?!

01:16:43.299 --> 01:16:44.865
You tried to kill me.

01:16:45.934 --> 01:16:47.301
You are the enemies!

01:16:47.303 --> 01:16:49.870
We were just stupid kids!

01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:53.841
But you are right
about one thing, mr roker.

01:16:53.843 --> 01:16:56.811
We are enemies now!

01:16:56.813 --> 01:17:00.114
And gravity...
Is so righteous.

01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:01.349
No!

01:17:29.979 --> 01:17:32.713
Sometimes I can't help
but imagine...

01:17:33.882 --> 01:17:36.851
what their lives
might have been.

01:17:36.853 --> 01:17:38.352
<i>Hillary...</i>

01:17:40.455 --> 01:17:42.256
she would be a news anchor...

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:45.459
<i>or a rich socialite...</i>

01:17:46.128 --> 01:17:48.262
helping the disadvantaged.

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:53.200
Rusty?

01:17:57.606 --> 01:18:00.975
He'd probably be running around
with the other hooligans...

01:18:02.544 --> 01:18:04.412
but then again...

01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:09.083
this might have changed him.

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:14.288
I could see him
turning a new leaf.

01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:19.126
Maybe becoming a cop.

01:18:21.396 --> 01:18:23.097
That would be ironic.

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:30.337
Shelly?

01:18:34.843 --> 01:18:37.845
Who knows
what amazing discoveries...

01:18:37.847 --> 01:18:39.513
she would have made.

01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:45.286
How the world will suffer
without her.

01:19:01.903 --> 01:19:03.471
Mike.

01:19:09.177 --> 01:19:11.712
He'd be winning
the big football game...

01:19:13.515 --> 01:19:16.117
and I'd be at the sideline
cheering him on.

01:19:17.986 --> 01:19:19.553
<i>We all would.</i>

01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:25.960
Sometimes when it's quiet...

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:29.630
and I'm all alone...

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:35.035
i pretend that...

01:19:37.572 --> 01:19:40.808
we're married and that
we have two children.

01:19:43.745 --> 01:19:45.346
Living...

01:19:48.416 --> 01:19:50.818
<i>in a safe suburb somewhere.</i>

01:19:53.688 --> 01:19:55.656
<i>But that's all gone now.</i>

01:20:45.607 --> 01:20:48.342
Look. That's the girl that lived
through the murder spree.

01:20:48.344 --> 01:20:51.145
Wow. I can't believe
she came to prom.

01:20:51.147 --> 01:20:52.880
Hey, back off, slick.

01:20:53.916 --> 01:20:55.249
Bogus.
