01:14.333 --> 01:17.167
Come on!
Put down your landing gear.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.267
Mmm. Right on
Mr. Jefferson's picture.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.233
Two for the price of one!

01:28.100 --> 01:30.000
Darn.

01:30.067 --> 01:32.867
Well, at least I got
the biggest pest.

01:34.900 --> 01:36.100
Oh, there you are.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.233
(HUMMING)

01:41.700 --> 01:42.700
One,

01:45.067 --> 01:46.733
two,

01:46.800 --> 01:48.267
-three.
-(BOTH SCREAMING)

01:49.367 --> 01:51.400
Florence, what are you doing?

01:51.467 --> 01:53.667
Trying to get rid of
a little devil that's
been bugging me all day.

01:53.733 --> 01:55.667
Oh, is George home already?

01:59.167 --> 02:01.067
Well, how did things go
down at the Help Center?

02:01.133 --> 02:04.867
Not so good. Our landlord
there is raising the rent

02:04.933 --> 02:07.067
and we do not have it
in the budget.

02:07.133 --> 02:08.533
Oh, that's a shame.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.633
And the board is putting me in
charge of raising more money.

02:11.700 --> 02:13.333
Weezy, get me a drink!

02:15.367 --> 02:17.400
George, don't yell at me
like that.

02:17.467 --> 02:19.600
Sorry, Weezy.
Florence, get me a drink!

02:21.867 --> 02:23.600
All right, mighty mouth.

02:25.067 --> 02:27.533
Why are you in such
a good mood?

02:27.600 --> 02:29.000
'Cause I'm getting killed.

02:29.067 --> 02:31.167
Killed by whom?

02:31.233 --> 02:34.367
The plant that does
my dry cleaning. They raised
the price on me again.

02:34.433 --> 02:36.367
George, it can't be a matter
of life and death.

02:36.433 --> 02:39.200
No, it's more
important than that.
It's a matter of money.

02:39.267 --> 02:42.500
Every time their prices go up,
my profits go down.

02:42.567 --> 02:46.100
Well, maybe you should
think about opening
your own cleaning plant.

02:46.167 --> 02:50.033
Look, Weezy, not only did
I think about it, I've been
out trying to find a building

02:50.100 --> 02:51.100
and it's hopeless.

02:52.233 --> 02:53.233
Oh, thank you.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.767
Mr. Jefferson, don't move!

02:55.833 --> 02:57.033
-Florence, what is it?
-Shh!

03:01.767 --> 03:02.767
Got you!

03:05.233 --> 03:06.500
Nasty thing.

03:08.633 --> 03:11.767
Kept sampling
the minced meat pie
I made this morning.

03:11.833 --> 03:13.400
Well, in that case,
you ain't got nothing
to worry about.

03:13.467 --> 03:14.467
It would have died
soon anyway.

03:17.667 --> 03:19.867
(PHONE RINGS)

03:19.933 --> 03:22.233
Weezy, do you know
how expensive it is

03:22.300 --> 03:24.367
to try to lease
a building in this city?

03:24.433 --> 03:26.367
As a matter of fact, I do.

03:26.433 --> 03:28.200
They're raising the rent
at the Help Center,

03:28.267 --> 03:30.267
and we're a non-profit
organization.

03:30.333 --> 03:32.767
Yeah, well if I don't
find a building to lease
soon at my price,

03:32.833 --> 03:35.600
I'm gonna be
a non-profit organization.

03:35.667 --> 03:38.400
Is there a reason
you can't buy a building?

03:38.467 --> 03:41.267
Yeah, there are a million
reasons. All of them green.

03:44.767 --> 03:47.000
That was Miss Willis.
They just got back
from Syracuse,

03:47.067 --> 03:49.100
and she's coming down
to get the mail.

03:49.167 --> 03:51.067
I wonder how the funeral went.

03:51.133 --> 03:54.467
She didn't say. Of course,
any funeral's okay if
you ain't the guest of honor.

03:59.433 --> 04:01.167
And if you had to be
the guest of honor,

04:01.233 --> 04:04.367
I can't think of a better one
than Tom's father.

04:04.433 --> 04:07.333
George, that's
a terrible thing to say.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.433
Tom was very considerate
when Mother Jefferson
passed away.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.567
That's different, Weezy.
Mama and me were close.

04:13.633 --> 04:15.967
Willis and his father
didn't even speak
to each other.

04:16.033 --> 04:18.900
-Well that doesn't mean
they didn't love each other.
-Oh!

04:18.967 --> 04:21.967
She's right. Because
I've been madly in love with
a guy for two years,

04:22.033 --> 04:23.833
and I ain't talked
to him once.

04:23.900 --> 04:27.000
-Why not?
-'Cause I don't know Billy
Dee Williams' phone number.

04:32.533 --> 04:36.567
Why don't we invite
Tom and Helen down
for dinner tonight?

04:36.633 --> 04:37.767
'Cause they might show up.

04:40.033 --> 04:42.533
George, Helen's been
out of town for a week.

04:42.600 --> 04:45.067
She probably doesn't have
any food in the house.

04:45.133 --> 04:48.733
Forget it, Weezy,
Tom and Helen are not coming
to dinner and that's that.

04:48.800 --> 04:49.800
(DOORBELL RINGS)

04:49.867 --> 04:51.333
Oh, that must be Helen.

04:51.400 --> 04:53.900
Now don't you forget to
offer her your sympathy.

04:53.967 --> 04:56.467
She's had my sympathy
ever since I met her husband.

04:58.500 --> 05:02.300
-Oh, welcome home, Helen.
-Aw!

05:02.367 --> 05:05.967
-Oh, come on in.
-Thanks, Louise.
It is good to be back.

05:06.033 --> 05:07.633
How did everything go?

05:07.700 --> 05:09.500
Well, it was pretty cold
up there.

05:09.567 --> 05:12.433
Oh, that's a shame.
The weather was nice here.

05:12.500 --> 05:16.900
I'm talking about
Tom's relatives. Most of
them are just like his father.

05:16.967 --> 05:18.167
They're dead, too?

05:21.400 --> 05:22.733
From the neck up.

05:24.067 --> 05:25.867
Ever since
Tom and I got married,

05:25.933 --> 05:28.167
they've treated
us like creatures
from outer space.

05:28.233 --> 05:30.167
Yeah, from the planet Zebra.

05:35.633 --> 05:41.067
George!
I'll get your mail, Helen.

05:41.133 --> 05:45.667
Um, Tom said to thank you
for the flowers.

05:45.733 --> 05:49.067
He'll probably stop by when
he gets back from looking
at the warehouse.

05:49.133 --> 05:51.367
What warehouse?

05:51.433 --> 05:54.900
His father's estate included
an empty warehouse over on
10th Avenue in the '40s.

05:54.967 --> 05:58.567
You mean to tell me
that Tom owns a warehouse
over on 10th Avenue?

05:58.633 --> 06:00.167
He will now.

06:00.233 --> 06:01.533
What's he gonna do with it?

06:01.600 --> 06:03.500
Well, I don't think
he's decided yet.

06:03.567 --> 06:05.933
Oh, that's a perfect location.

06:06.933 --> 06:08.200
For, for what?

06:08.267 --> 06:11.067
For, uh, for Tom to own
an empty warehouse.

06:12.633 --> 06:13.900
Here you are, Helen.

06:13.967 --> 06:16.333
Oh, thanks.
Well, I guess I'll...

06:16.400 --> 06:18.267
-Hey, wait a minute!
-Oh, what's the matter,
George?

06:18.333 --> 06:21.033
Weezy, I just came up
with a great idea.

06:21.100 --> 06:24.467
Why don't we invite
the Willises over here
for dinner tonight?

06:28.400 --> 06:29.500
But, George, I...

06:29.567 --> 06:31.333
Look, Weezy, they've been
out of town for a week,

06:31.400 --> 06:33.500
and Helen probably
doesn't have any food
in the house. Right?

06:33.567 --> 06:35.667
-Well I...
-Uh, George, I...

06:35.733 --> 06:38.600
Look, I insist, Weez.
Tom and Helen are coming
down for dinner tonight.

06:38.667 --> 06:40.267
And that's that.

06:40.333 --> 06:43.667
George, sometimes
you amaze me.

06:43.733 --> 06:46.300
Thank you, Weez.

06:51.200 --> 06:54.100
We'd love to have you, Helen.
About 6:00?

06:54.167 --> 06:55.667
Great. I'll bring some wine.

06:55.733 --> 06:59.200
-Uh, don't forget
to bring Tom.
-And bring Alan, too.

06:59.267 --> 07:02.867
-We'd love to see him.
-Yeah, right,
bring Alan, too.

07:02.933 --> 07:04.267
Okay. See you later.

07:06.633 --> 07:07.833
Who the hell is Alan?

07:11.100 --> 07:13.300
Tom and Helen's son. Remember?

07:13.367 --> 07:15.667
Oh, yeah, the one
with the bad luck.

07:15.733 --> 07:18.367
-Bad luck?
-Yeah. He turned out white.

07:21.233 --> 07:23.667
Well, he's sure got
a lot of black in him,

07:23.733 --> 07:26.967
because the last time
you saw Alan he beat you
at playing the dozens.

07:27.033 --> 07:30.633
Beat me? Look, Weezy, ain't no
halfway honky gonna beat me
playing no dozens.

07:32.667 --> 07:37.400
I remember the exact words.
"You better get off my back

07:37.467 --> 07:41.467
"and leave me alone
'cause the teeth you save
will be your own."

07:41.533 --> 07:43.267
Oh, shoot, that's an old one.

07:43.333 --> 07:45.533
I know.
That's the one you said.

07:47.133 --> 07:51.800
Then Alan said,
"You got hips like a snake,
and a face like a shoe.

07:51.867 --> 07:54.833
"You're a jive turkey fake
who was born in the zoo."

07:54.900 --> 07:56.200
Weezy.

07:58.067 --> 08:01.267
And he said, "If
it wasn't for the fact that
you are 5'2"...

08:01.333 --> 08:04.067
-Can it, Weez.
-"...like white on rice,
I'd be all over you."

08:06.333 --> 08:10.767
Louise, I said to can it.

08:10.833 --> 08:13.867
Now what is that two-tone
turkey doing here anyway?

08:13.933 --> 08:17.933
He came back for
the funeral, and now he's
visiting with his parents.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.533
-How you know that?
-Helen told me
before they left.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.700
Oh, well, Weezy, look,
can't you call Helen

08:22.767 --> 08:26.833
and tell her that you're
sorry, we only got enough
food for her and Tom?

08:26.900 --> 08:31.300
George, it won't hurt you
to be nice to Alan
for one night.

08:31.367 --> 08:33.800
He'll be going home
in a couple of days.

08:33.867 --> 08:37.633
-Where's home?
-I think he's living
somewhere in New Mexico.

08:37.700 --> 08:41.667
New Mexico? Hmm.
If he was smart,
he'd move to Alaska.

08:41.733 --> 08:43.467
Alaska?

08:43.533 --> 08:47.000
Sure. With the Willises
as his parents, he'd make
a perfect Eskimo pie.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.133
(DOORBELL RINGS)

08:58.433 --> 08:59.500
I got it!

09:02.133 --> 09:05.633
Well, well, well,
look who's here, Weezy,
our best friends.

09:05.700 --> 09:07.433
No, George, it's just
Helen and me.

09:09.033 --> 09:10.567
What a joker, huh, Weez?

09:12.633 --> 09:14.333
Come on in.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.833
-Here's the wine, Louise.
-Oh, thanks, Helen.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.500
Uh, where's Alan?

09:19.567 --> 09:21.867
Oh, he has other plans.
He's upstairs now
taking a shower.

09:21.933 --> 09:23.600
I hope he remembers
how to use one.

09:23.667 --> 09:25.433
Tom!

09:25.500 --> 09:28.933
Well, it's true.
They don't even have plumbing
in that commune he lives in.

09:29.000 --> 09:32.400
Tom, Alan bathes
every day in a river.
What's the difference?

09:32.467 --> 09:34.833
The difference is
he's our son, not a trout.

09:36.733 --> 09:40.933
Oh, calm down, Tom.
You've been on Alan's
back ever since he got home.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.333
Well, I can't help it, Helen.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.433
I didn't spend all these years
raising my kid

09:44.500 --> 09:47.000
so he could run off
and live in the desert
with a bunch of weirdos.

09:47.067 --> 09:48.833
-Tom, I don't understand...
-Oh, come on, Helen,

09:48.900 --> 09:50.767
let's go help Florence
with dinner.

09:50.833 --> 09:53.200
Good idea. She could use
all the help she can get.

09:54.133 --> 09:55.900
Right, Tom, old buddy?

09:57.433 --> 10:01.733
That doesn't sound like Tom.
He's usually so open-minded.

10:01.800 --> 10:05.267
When it comes to his only
son, Tom's open mind closes.

10:06.700 --> 10:08.233
Hey, look what
we got here, Willis.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.333

things you like so much.

Oh, thanks, George.

10:12.033 --> 10:14.733
Go ahead,
take a whole handful.
I got them especially for you.

10:14.800 --> 10:18.633
-Eating does help me
when I'm upset.
-Uh.

10:18.700 --> 10:21.700
-Oh, I hear your father
left you a...
-I don't believe it!

have no goals at all?

10:24.500 --> 10:26.767
Look, will you forget about
that old crazy kid of yours?

10:28.900 --> 10:30.900
-Now what do you want
to drink?
-Huh?

10:30.967 --> 10:32.933
-Drink!
-Oh, uh, Scotch.

Now, Alan spent two years...

10:34.900 --> 10:38.900
Speaking of Scotch,
Helen tells me that
you inherited a warehouse.

10:38.967 --> 10:41.600
Well, what does Scotch
have to do with
a warehouse?

10:41.667 --> 10:44.033
Well, after they make the
Scotch, they store it.
Where do they store it?

10:44.100 --> 10:45.100
In the warehouse, right?

Oh, right, I guess.

we'll sit down and
have a nice long talk, okay?

Like I said, you haven't
changed a bit.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.300
Peace, brother?

11:23.367 --> 11:24.900
Takes more than
a handshake to make
a brother.

11:24.967 --> 11:29.033
Yeah. It takes heart and
soul to make a brother.

11:29.100 --> 11:33.733
And you ain't got one
nor the other.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.800
-Now don't start that again.
-Why? Are you afraid
I'm gonna beat you again?

11:36.867 --> 11:39.433
-What do you want?
-Well, I wanna talk
to my father.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.733
Well, he don't wanna
talk to you.
You've upset him already.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.500
But there's something
I gotta tell him.

11:43.567 --> 11:45.533
Okay, tell me. I'll see
that he gets the message.
You get the message?

11:45.600 --> 11:47.800
Mr. Jefferson.

11:47.867 --> 11:50.667
Look, let me lay this out
for you in black and white.

11:50.733 --> 11:53.533
No, I better not do that,
because you'd only
understand half of it.

11:57.267 --> 12:00.633
Look, I don't want
you busting in here,
spoiling my evening.

12:00.700 --> 12:02.400
Now, you say what
you gotta say and get out.

12:02.467 --> 12:06.367
Okay. Just tell my dad
a lawyer just called
from Syracuse.

12:06.433 --> 12:08.233
My grandfather's will left
everything to me.

12:08.300 --> 12:12.200
Uh-huh. Okay, now you said it.
Now I got something
to say to you.

12:12.267 --> 12:15.067
You're a sugar-coated zebra,
dirtying up my pad.

12:15.133 --> 12:17.700
Now you better stay
out of my face, before
I make you wish you had.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.500
Go ahead!

12:37.267 --> 12:40.567
The will left everything...
He's got the warehouse!

12:40.633 --> 12:45.700
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

12:48.967 --> 12:54.033
Come on, blood,
I was only joking. I call
all my best friends Zebra.

12:54.100 --> 12:55.500
You do, huh?

12:55.567 --> 12:56.900
Well, just the black
and white ones.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.167
Hey, y'all, look who I found.

13:03.233 --> 13:05.900
-Hi, sweetheart.
-I thought you were going out?

13:05.967 --> 13:07.667
Well, I was but...

13:07.733 --> 13:09.900
But he decided to come
down here and have dinner
with us first, right?

13:09.967 --> 13:13.167
Why, hello, Alan!
How have you been?

13:13.233 --> 13:18.433
Fine, Mrs. Jefferson.
Ooh, man! You're looking
clean as ever!

13:18.500 --> 13:21.367
Why, thank you! I hope
you're staying for dinner.

13:21.433 --> 13:22.533
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.467
You sure can't,
dressed like that.

13:24.533 --> 13:26.633
Cool it, Willis!
The kid's dressed fine!

13:26.700 --> 13:30.400
Hey, I'm sorry, Dad.
My tuxedo's in the cleaners.

13:30.467 --> 13:32.200
Don't get smart with me.

13:32.267 --> 13:34.467
Hey, take it easy, Willis.
He's only joking.

13:34.533 --> 13:37.500
You got a great
sense of humor there, kid.

13:37.567 --> 13:40.233
Hey, listen,
we're friends.
Call me Zebra.

13:43.233 --> 13:47.200
Hey, try some of these,
they're great.
Little cheese things.

13:47.267 --> 13:51.633
-I made them especially
for you.
-Thanks, Mr. Jefferson.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.533
I'll get drinks.
What would everybody like?

13:54.600 --> 13:55.967
Bourbon for me, Louise.

13:56.033 --> 13:57.467
-Tom?
-Uh, Scotch.

13:57.533 --> 13:58.567
-Alan?
-I pass.

13:58.633 --> 14:01.967
You sure do.
I was just joking.

14:05.567 --> 14:09.300
Mom, Dad, there's
something I wanna tell you.
While I was upstairs...

14:09.367 --> 14:12.100
-You didn't break the
shower, did you?
-Tom!

14:12.167 --> 14:15.767
A lawyer called
about the will.
Grandpa left everything to me.

14:15.833 --> 14:18.067
-To you?
-Yeah, yeah.
Listen, I'm, I'm sorry.

14:18.133 --> 14:19.533
I figure he did it just
to make you mad.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.967
He wasn't the most
liberal guy in the world.

14:22.033 --> 14:25.433
Yeah, that dumb honky!
Nothing I hate worse
than a bigot.

14:30.300 --> 14:33.100
-Dad, about the will...
-Oh, I don't care about that!

14:33.167 --> 14:35.033
As long as you put
the money to good use.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.967
Uh, well, you know, if I ever
do inherit any kind of
bread like that,

14:38.033 --> 14:40.900
I am supposed to share it
with the other members
of our commune.

14:40.967 --> 14:44.067
-Now wait a minute,
if you think...
-Hey, take it easy, Willis.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.900
Alan has a right to live
his own life.

14:45.967 --> 14:48.667
If the will says
the warehouse is his, he can
do whatever he wants with it.

14:48.733 --> 14:50.600
-Look, George...
-Now, what you should do...

14:50.667 --> 14:52.400
What you should do with it is
sell the warehouse and
use the money...

14:52.467 --> 14:54.533
-No, you don't sell it!
-Why not?

14:54.600 --> 14:55.967
It costs too much!

14:56.767 --> 14:57.800
Huh?

14:57.867 --> 15:00.333
I mean, uh, uh, what you
should do is lease it.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.967
-In fact, you should lease it
at a loss.
-At a loss?

15:03.033 --> 15:05.733
Yeah. That way you make money.
And you get back a bundle
in taxes.

15:05.800 --> 15:09.433
Don't you know nothing
about business?

15:09.500 --> 15:12.200
Look, I already know
what I'm gonna do
with the warehouse.

15:12.267 --> 15:13.733
You do?

15:13.800 --> 15:15.800
I'm gonna give it to you, Dad.
It's really yours anyway.

15:27.467 --> 15:30.600
He's right, Willis.
It's up to you now
to lease it.

15:30.667 --> 15:32.833
I'll tell you what.
What if I lease the warehouse

15:32.900 --> 15:35.267
and use the money
to send you back to school?

15:35.333 --> 15:38.500
(SIGHS) Let's talk
about this later, Dad.
I gotta get going.

15:38.567 --> 15:40.200
Hey, leave some of those
for your father!

15:42.167 --> 15:46.467
Alan, honey, maybe
you should listen to what
your father has to say and...

15:46.533 --> 15:51.200
Later, Mom. Dad.
Real nice seeing you again,
Mrs. Jefferson.

15:51.267 --> 15:53.933
And, uh, Mr. Jefferson.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.533
Oh, well, Willis, it looks
like you're stuck
with that warehouse again.

16:00.600 --> 16:04.067
But don't worry,
I'm sure you'll find somebody
to take it off your hands.

16:04.133 --> 16:08.367
Oh, why don't we all sit down
and have a nice
enjoyable dinner?

16:08.433 --> 16:10.067
Oh, if only Alan would...

16:10.133 --> 16:13.100
With no more talk about
Alan or your father's will.
Understand?

16:14.167 --> 16:16.400
-I can wait till tomorrow.
-What?

16:16.467 --> 16:19.067
I said, what are we gonna do?
Wait until tomorrow?
Let's eat.

16:21.900 --> 16:24.433
-Right hand blue.
-I have leg on yellow.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.500
-(DOORBELL RINGS)
-I'll be right back.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.333
Don't worry.
I'm not going anywhere.

16:30.233 --> 16:32.233
Oh, hello, George.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.633
-Hi, Helen. Is Tom home?
-No, he had to go to a
business meeting.

16:34.700 --> 16:37.400
-About the warehouse?
-No. Something at the
publishing house.

16:37.467 --> 16:39.933
-Oh. When's he gonna be back?
-He should be home soon.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.600
-You want him to call you?
-Yeah, good idea.

16:42.667 --> 16:44.033
Oh, you got my phone number,
don't you?

16:46.067 --> 16:47.200
Yes, George.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.267
Just checking.

16:49.033 --> 16:50.400
(JENNY STRAINING)

16:50.467 --> 16:54.967
-Can you hurry?
-Right. Right foot green.

16:55.033 --> 16:58.133
Right foot green.
Okay, I get it.

16:58.200 --> 16:59.433
(ALAN GRUNTS)

16:59.500 --> 17:00.867
Yay!

17:00.933 --> 17:03.733
The winner and still champion!

17:06.033 --> 17:08.400
-So much
for the great white hope.
-Aw!

17:10.167 --> 17:11.400
You two wanna play again?

17:11.467 --> 17:14.300
No, thanks, Mom.
I've suffered enough defeat
for today.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.100
Well, we could call it a tie.

17:16.167 --> 17:19.800
Well, you know what
they say about a tie.
It's like kissing your sister.

17:20.467 --> 17:21.867
Hey!

17:21.933 --> 17:25.533
But whoever said that
didn't have you
for a sister.

17:25.600 --> 17:28.767
Well, I know I'm glad
I got you for a brother.

17:28.833 --> 17:30.833
Boy, you remember when I
was in the fourth grade,

17:30.900 --> 17:33.767
and Ralph Whittaker, he
kept pulling my hair and,

17:33.833 --> 17:38.633
and calling me "Jenny,
Jenny, pick-a-ninny."

17:38.700 --> 17:41.700
Well, after I told you
about it, he never
bothered me again.

17:41.767 --> 17:43.433
What did you do, Alan?

17:43.500 --> 17:45.900
-(DOORBELL RINGS)
-Oh, I just asked Ralphie
to stop it.

17:45.967 --> 17:49.033
When that didn't work,
I just went upside his head
with my pencil box.

17:51.033 --> 17:52.233
Did he get home yet?

17:52.300 --> 17:54.467
No, I said that...

17:54.533 --> 17:56.867
I thought maybe you tried
to call while I was
in the elevator.

17:56.933 --> 17:58.900
-George!
-I'll just wait for him.

17:58.967 --> 18:00.200
-But I...
-(PHONE RINGS)

18:00.267 --> 18:01.800
You better get that,
it might be for you.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.000
Hi, Mr. Jefferson.

18:05.067 --> 18:06.467
(GEORGE GROANS)

18:06.533 --> 18:08.800
Boy, do you believe that
Mom and Dad saved all this?

18:08.867 --> 18:14.433
Hey, Jen, look, this is
the record we used to play to
practice our dance lessons.

18:14.500 --> 18:18.267
Oh, yeah. Remember,
we hated dancing together.

18:18.333 --> 18:20.100
That don't surprise me.

18:20.167 --> 18:22.833
You probably wanted
to do the Funky Chicken,
and he wanted to do the Polka.

18:27.733 --> 18:29.600
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

18:36.367 --> 18:40.600
Um, Mr. Jefferson,
would you mind?

18:40.667 --> 18:41.933
I guess not.

18:47.233 --> 18:51.000
No, I meant would
you mind leaving us alone?

18:51.467 --> 18:52.467
Hmph!

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
Okay, I'll come back later.

18:56.067 --> 18:59.267
Sorry, Mr. Jefferson, but
Jenny and I haven't had a
chance to talk in three years.

18:59.333 --> 19:02.767
That ain't my fault. You're
the one who keeps running off
to that dumb commune.

19:05.300 --> 19:09.100
Man, that little dude's
mouth should be declared
a disaster area.

19:09.167 --> 19:12.200
Oh, don't let him bother you.

19:12.267 --> 19:15.667
Right. May I have this
dance, young lady?

19:15.733 --> 19:17.700
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

19:20.733 --> 19:24.133
Gee, you're sure
looking good, Jenny.
Marriage agrees with you.

19:24.200 --> 19:29.800
Yeah, it does.
Boy, does that commune
agree with you?

19:29.867 --> 19:31.667
Sure. Why?

19:31.733 --> 19:35.067
Well, you went to the commune
to find out about yourself,
right?

19:35.133 --> 19:36.667
Yeah.

19:36.733 --> 19:39.967
Well, what did you find out?
Are you white or black?

19:42.200 --> 19:44.700
I found out I'm me.

19:44.767 --> 19:50.133
Oh, well look at me. Now
that you've got that together,
why do you have to go back?

19:50.200 --> 19:52.067
Have you got
any better suggestions?

19:52.133 --> 19:54.033
Well, you finished
two years of college.

19:54.100 --> 19:58.633
Now, you could go back
to school and get your degree,
or you could get a job.

19:58.700 --> 20:00.600
-You...
-And I could what?

20:00.667 --> 20:04.700
Oh, you could tell me
to shut up. I sound
just like Daddy. I'm sorry.

20:04.767 --> 20:08.233
You don't sound like Dad.
'Cause he wouldn't
say "sorry".

20:08.300 --> 20:09.833
Sorry for what?

20:09.900 --> 20:11.400
Oh, hi, Daddy.

20:13.967 --> 20:18.367
-Hi, Jenny. Alan.
-Hi, Dad.

20:18.433 --> 20:21.200
Tom, I just talked to
your father's lawyer.

20:21.267 --> 20:23.600
There's a clause in
the will that prohibits Alan

20:23.667 --> 20:28.267
from giving the property
to anybody on our side
of the family.

20:28.333 --> 20:32.600
My father's causing more
trouble for us now than
when he was alive.

20:32.667 --> 20:34.800
Well, look, I gotta be going.
I gotta get down
to the Jefferson's

20:34.867 --> 20:37.933
-and pick up something
for Lionel. Bye, Daddy.
-Sweetheart.

20:38.000 --> 20:41.833
Oh, I'll go with you,
Jenny. I wanna talk to Louise
about the Help Center.

20:41.900 --> 20:43.267
Be back later, honey.

20:45.433 --> 20:48.133
-Bye, Alan.
-Bye, sis.

20:52.533 --> 20:57.300
Oh, Alan! It's good
to have you home again.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.633
Well, son, now that you
have the warehouse...

21:04.700 --> 21:08.267
Dad, please don't tell me
what to do.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.533
What makes you think I was
gonna tell you what to do?

21:10.600 --> 21:13.333
You called me "son".
And whenever you call me that,

21:13.400 --> 21:15.000
it means you're gonna
start preaching.

21:15.067 --> 21:18.600
-It does not.
-Yes, it does.
Even when I was little.

21:18.667 --> 21:21.667
"Son, don't you think
you should do your homework?"

21:21.733 --> 21:24.033
Well, you never wanted
to do your homework.

21:24.100 --> 21:26.067
Dad, I made it through school.

21:26.133 --> 21:27.433
Well, that's not the point.

21:27.500 --> 21:28.567
(DOORBELL RINGS)

21:28.633 --> 21:30.133
Dad, who cares?

21:30.200 --> 21:31.967
That's your problem,
Alan, you don't care
about anything.

21:32.667 --> 21:33.933
Hey, Willis, old buddy!

21:37.500 --> 21:40.433
You mean I just don't care
about the same things you do.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.967
What's that supposed to mean?

21:42.033 --> 21:43.600
That means I don't dig
where you're coming from,

21:43.667 --> 21:45.433
and I ain't too ecstatic
about where you're going!

21:45.500 --> 21:47.667
-Oh!
-What did he say?

21:47.733 --> 21:49.200
He says you're a fool.

21:54.200 --> 21:59.033
A fool? Yes, I suppose
I am a fool for letting
a bum stay in my house!

21:59.100 --> 22:03.000
Yeah, you're right.
You don't want no bums
around here!

22:03.067 --> 22:04.500
Where do you think
you're going?

22:04.567 --> 22:07.567
I am going back to New
Mexico where nobody
hassles me!

22:07.633 --> 22:09.900
Oh, so you're gonna leave,
just like that, huh?

22:09.967 --> 22:14.000
No. First I'm gonna stop
downstairs and say
goodbye to Mom and Jenny.

22:14.067 --> 22:15.467
Well, that's very nice of you.

22:15.533 --> 22:21.200
Yeah. I must get my niceness
from Mom's side of the family!

22:21.267 --> 22:25.233
Oh, forget about him, Willis.
If you need somebody
to talk to, I'm here.

22:27.033 --> 22:29.033
Thanks, George.

22:29.100 --> 22:32.767
Sit down, relax. Let
it all pour out. Maybe I can
help you with your problem.

22:32.833 --> 22:35.200
Oh, it's that kid.
I just don't understand him.

22:35.267 --> 22:36.267
Now that he's got
the warehouse...

22:36.333 --> 22:39.067
No, no, no, no.
You got the warehouse.

22:39.133 --> 22:42.200
-No. The will says
he can't give it to me.
-What?

22:42.267 --> 22:45.200
So, you see, my problem is...

22:45.267 --> 22:46.867
Who cares about your problem?

22:52.933 --> 22:55.600
Oh, Alan,
couldn't you stick around
for a couple of days

22:55.667 --> 22:57.400
and try to work things out
with your father?

22:57.467 --> 23:00.033
Mom, if I thought it would
do any good, I would.

23:00.100 --> 23:03.667
But if I stay in
that apartment, Dad and I
will just get farther apart.

23:03.733 --> 23:06.300
Well, why don't you stay
with, with me and Lionel?

23:06.367 --> 23:08.267
Oh, you don't have
enough room.

23:08.333 --> 23:11.467
Besides, you and Lionel
don't need me interfering
with your lives.

23:11.533 --> 23:17.867
Oh, I wish I could help, but
you know George. It's obvious
you can't stay here, Alan.

23:17.933 --> 23:19.967
Weezy, I'm surprised at you.

23:23.367 --> 23:25.833
Why would you have such
a low opinion of me?

23:26.833 --> 23:29.433
-What?
-This kid's in trouble.

23:29.500 --> 23:32.167
-I know. But I...
-Ain't you got no heart?

23:32.233 --> 23:33.833
There's plenty of room here.

23:33.900 --> 23:35.967
And you can stay here until
you and me, I mean,

23:36.033 --> 23:37.933
until you and your father
work things out.

23:39.733 --> 23:42.100
You mean you want me
to stay here with you?

23:42.167 --> 23:43.400
I insist.

23:43.467 --> 23:45.567
I feel like I'm in
The Twilight Zone.

23:48.100 --> 23:50.933
-George...
-Don't fight me on this,
Weezy.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.367
Fight you? I...

23:52.433 --> 23:57.867
Come on, blood, sit down.
From now on,
my house is your house.

24:00.033 --> 24:03.767
And it won't be long
before the roof falls in.

24:36.367 --> 24:40.367
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.

24:41.433 --> 24:43.700
* Movin', movin' on up
