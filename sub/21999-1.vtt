WEBVTT

00:02.247 --> 00:03.546
Here in the Big Apple

00:03.897 --> 00:05.263
we love our scandals.

00:05.697 --> 00:07.296
They're the oxygen we breathe.

00:07.699 --> 00:10.155
Like the spring flowers in Central Park,

00:10.389 --> 00:12.254
they bloom across the front pages

00:12.255 --> 00:14.216
of our beloved tabloids.

00:14.241 --> 00:16.120
Whether it's that mayoral candidate

00:16.122 --> 00:17.688
and his sexting,

00:17.689 --> 00:19.521
or that governor and his friend

00:19.522 --> 00:21.221
with the perfect lady parts,

00:21.222 --> 00:23.088
or our president
and his second wife-to-be

00:23.089 --> 00:24.354
cheating on his first wife,

00:24.355 --> 00:25.954
or his third wife-to-be

00:25.955 --> 00:27.877
cheating on his second wife,

00:27.902 --> 00:29.135
it's a scandal

00:29.160 --> 00:30.992
and we love it.

00:31.017 --> 00:34.611
And when the scandal fades, we wilt,

00:34.611 --> 00:37.771
until suddenly, unexpectedly,

00:38.145 --> 00:39.778
a new one comes along.

00:41.445 --> 00:43.577
You tell that Australian son of a bitch

00:43.578 --> 00:46.944
that a billion is as high
as I'm going to go.

00:46.945 --> 00:48.544
And if he wants to find anyone else

00:48.545 --> 00:50.077
who's willing to buy his newspapers

00:50.078 --> 00:51.610
and television stations for more,

00:51.611 --> 00:54.310
he should go ahead and make the deal.

00:54.311 --> 00:56.044
But he'd better make it fast,

00:56.045 --> 00:59.410
because my offer is only good
for 12 more hours.

01:05.111 --> 01:06.377
You're still up?

01:07.342 --> 01:08.644
I told you,

01:08.645 --> 01:12.377
there's nothing else
to discuss, darling.

01:12.378 --> 01:14.577
I'm not about to renegotiate our prenup.

01:14.578 --> 01:16.477
We've been married for five years.

01:16.478 --> 01:19.344
People don't renegotiate their
prenups after they're married.

01:19.345 --> 01:21.245
That's why it's called "prenup."

01:22.691 --> 01:24.677
Well...

01:24.678 --> 01:28.277
I would hope, after
all these years together,

01:28.278 --> 01:29.777
you'd see that I'm worth far more

01:29.778 --> 01:31.444
than you originally thought.

01:31.445 --> 01:33.244
I'm sorry, dearest, but I believe

01:33.245 --> 01:37.177
that the agreement we reached
before we wed was very generous.

01:37.178 --> 01:38.941
And I still believe that.

01:39.625 --> 01:41.254
Look at it from my side.

01:41.678 --> 01:46.544
Each day that goes by is less
and less kind to your beauty.

01:46.545 --> 01:49.910
And I haven't asked to renegotiate.

01:49.911 --> 01:51.261
Have I?

01:51.931 --> 01:53.231
No.

02:10.511 --> 02:11.877
Oh, my God.

02:11.878 --> 02:13.610
Kara, my darling!

02:13.611 --> 02:14.778
What did you do?

02:18.078 --> 02:20.077
No!

02:26.845 --> 02:28.744
No!

02:28.745 --> 02:30.411
Wh... Why?

02:46.345 --> 02:47.510
911 operator.

02:47.511 --> 02:48.544
Hello, police.

02:48.545 --> 02:49.777
Yes, ma'am.

02:49.778 --> 02:51.310
This is Kara Clayton.

02:51.311 --> 02:52.344
And what's your emergency?

02:52.345 --> 02:54.577
My husband tried to stab me to death.

02:54.578 --> 02:56.977
- Okay, ma'am.
- I shot him three times.

02:56.978 --> 02:59.177
I need you to stay on the line with me.

03:44.378 --> 03:46.844
Hey, where's Dr. Bull?

03:46.845 --> 03:48.377
Mm.

04:06.978 --> 04:08.010
Dr. Bull?

04:08.011 --> 04:09.711
They're ready to see you now.

04:11.045 --> 04:12.910
Dr. Bull, Perry Sinclair.

04:12.911 --> 04:14.644
- Hey.
- Thank you for joining us.

04:14.645 --> 04:16.510
Well, how could I resist?

04:16.809 --> 04:17.809
Look at this room.

04:17.810 --> 04:19.108
Who do we have here?

04:19.108 --> 04:21.075
This is George Donahue,

04:21.076 --> 04:22.742
Clayton Communications' COO.

04:22.743 --> 04:23.775
Doctor.

04:23.776 --> 04:24.890
It's an honor.

04:25.576 --> 04:27.108
And look at this.

04:27.109 --> 04:29.208
Six different law firms
represented here.

04:29.209 --> 04:31.308
It's like the New York Yankees
of attorneys.

04:31.309 --> 04:33.308
What happened? Bill Gates
run a traffic light?

04:34.676 --> 04:36.242
Have a seat, Dr. Bull.

04:36.243 --> 04:39.108
All right, but only
'cause you outnumber me.

04:40.976 --> 04:42.575
What can I do for you fellas?

04:42.576 --> 04:44.808
I think it's what we can
do for you, Dr. Bull.

04:44.809 --> 04:46.937
We'd like to offer you a job.

04:47.080 --> 04:49.308
You are a witness.

04:49.309 --> 04:51.191
And you have rights.

04:52.230 --> 04:56.062
The opposition lawyer
turns to you and says,

04:56.142 --> 04:58.308
"Let's assume
the following hypothetical."

04:58.476 --> 05:00.876
You have the right to say...

05:02.543 --> 05:03.708
Marissa in here?

05:03.709 --> 05:06.808
No, nope, nobody, just, uh, just me.

05:06.809 --> 05:09.460
Sorry.

05:13.409 --> 05:15.008
Hey, I've been looking

05:15.009 --> 05:16.708
all over for you.
What are you doing in here?

05:16.709 --> 05:19.942
Going over the books
where no one can see them.

05:19.943 --> 05:21.875
Oh, the books are great.

05:21.876 --> 05:24.275
The books are gonna be fine.

05:24.276 --> 05:25.775
Oh, my goodness.

05:25.776 --> 05:27.075
A quarter of a million dollars?

05:27.076 --> 05:29.742
Who gave you a check for
a quarter of a million dollars?

05:29.743 --> 05:32.008
The Clayton family estate.

05:32.009 --> 05:34.508
They're pressuring the DA
to try the young widow Clayton

05:34.509 --> 05:35.975
for the murder of her husband.

05:35.976 --> 05:37.854
Murder? Based on...

05:37.855 --> 05:39.328
Based on the fact that she shot him.

05:39.329 --> 05:40.875
A fact she does not dispute.

05:40.876 --> 05:42.675
- Can you say "money in the bank"?
- Okay.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.775
But according to the paper,
the late Mr. Clayton

05:44.776 --> 05:47.608
was attempting to slice and dice
his dearly beloved

05:47.609 --> 05:50.575
just prior to her deciding
to use him for target practice.

05:50.576 --> 05:52.175
I believe they call that "self-defense."

05:52.176 --> 05:54.275
Maybe. Or maybe she shot first

05:54.276 --> 05:56.175
and he stabbed her in self defense.

05:56.176 --> 05:57.642
Who cares?

05:57.643 --> 05:59.575
It's a quarter of a
million dollar retainer,

05:59.576 --> 06:02.275
and another quarter of a million
if we actually go to trial

06:02.276 --> 06:04.575
- and find Mrs. Clayton guilty.
- Wow.

06:04.576 --> 06:07.908
I had no idea the famous
Dr. Jason Bull can be bought.

06:07.909 --> 06:09.142
For a quarter of a million dollars,

06:09.143 --> 06:10.143
not only can I be bought,

06:10.144 --> 06:12.375
you can gift wrap me.

06:12.376 --> 06:14.008
Which reminds me,

06:14.009 --> 06:15.275
guess who's in town?

06:15.609 --> 06:17.942
I'm sorry, did I miss
a change of subject?

06:17.943 --> 06:21.351
The best un-wrapper in the world.

06:21.376 --> 06:24.426
Miss Diana Lindsay, attorney-at-law.

06:25.149 --> 06:26.782
Single woman at large.

06:26.919 --> 06:27.990
New York.

06:28.015 --> 06:29.384
What are you talking about?

06:29.409 --> 06:31.142
New Yorkers, they sound
just like everybody else.

06:31.143 --> 06:32.608
French.

06:32.609 --> 06:34.508
Do you come
to this ceiling often, monsieur?

06:34.509 --> 06:37.775
And now your hometown, Callisto, Texas.

06:37.776 --> 06:40.431
Callisto, Texas? All right.

06:40.432 --> 06:43.842
That fella Bull,
he's all hat and no cattle.

06:43.843 --> 06:45.875
That's not what you said 15 minutes ago.

06:45.876 --> 06:47.575
Well, I'm sorry, darling, but I lied.

06:47.576 --> 06:49.476
Mm, that's what I love about you.

06:50.109 --> 06:53.208
What? That I lie?

06:53.209 --> 06:55.642
No, that there are so many of you.

06:55.643 --> 06:58.875
It's like I can cheat on you with you.

06:58.876 --> 07:02.408
Well, I am glad you are in
such a good mood, Doctor.

07:02.409 --> 07:03.573
Mm.

07:04.076 --> 07:05.776
I need a favor.

07:06.709 --> 07:08.408
It's the reason I invited you over here.

07:09.843 --> 07:11.708
Stupid me, I thought
I'd already done the favor

07:11.709 --> 07:12.775
you invited me over here for.

07:12.776 --> 07:15.208
Hmm. Don't overestimate yourself.

07:15.209 --> 07:16.475
That was my favor to you.

07:16.476 --> 07:17.908
- Ah.
- Mm.

07:17.909 --> 07:18.876
Really?

07:18.877 --> 07:20.743
I need your help with something, Jason.

07:23.976 --> 07:25.675
You know, ever since I lost that case

07:25.676 --> 07:27.242
where the sky bridge fell down,
I've been looking for

07:27.243 --> 07:29.808
another high-profile
New York opportunity.

07:29.809 --> 07:30.809
Something to

07:30.810 --> 07:32.477
establish my name here.

07:33.395 --> 07:35.063
I think I found it.

07:36.643 --> 07:37.675
Kara Clayton.

07:37.676 --> 07:39.609
She's asked me to represent her.

07:40.284 --> 07:43.175
Her late husband's estate's been
putting all kinds of pressure

07:43.176 --> 07:44.775
on the DA to try her for murder.

07:44.776 --> 07:47.342
- You don't say.
- Well, the...

07:47.343 --> 07:50.208
publicity alone makes this
an opportunity of a lifetime.

07:50.209 --> 07:53.480
Not to mention the fact that
this is, uh, self-defense,

07:53.481 --> 07:54.880
pretty cut and dried.

07:54.881 --> 07:56.247
I hear the other side's already gone out

07:56.248 --> 07:57.580
and hired the biggest guns in town

07:57.581 --> 07:58.824
- to go after her.
- I know.

07:58.849 --> 07:59.849
Mm.

07:59.874 --> 08:01.580
That's why I like it.

08:01.581 --> 08:03.080
Diana versus Goliath.

08:03.081 --> 08:04.213
You know? Boys against the girls.

08:04.214 --> 08:05.247
What?

08:05.248 --> 08:08.221
Except... one boy.

08:08.648 --> 08:10.280
I want you on my team, Jason.

08:10.281 --> 08:14.247
I need you on my team.

08:16.214 --> 08:17.813
Okay, we're both naked
under these sheets here,

08:17.814 --> 08:19.380
you don't have to make that face
to let me know

08:19.381 --> 08:21.114
you're not excited.

08:24.048 --> 08:25.113
Diana, I can't.

08:25.114 --> 08:27.213
Yes, you can. You just have to want to.

08:27.214 --> 08:29.780
You just have to go into TAC
and clear up your schedule

08:29.781 --> 08:32.078
because this is more important.

08:32.748 --> 08:34.179
I'm more important.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.113
I've already signed with the other side.

08:36.582 --> 08:38.248
I'm working with the Clayton estate.

08:40.780 --> 08:41.847
Quit.

08:41.847 --> 08:43.547
I can't.

08:43.548 --> 08:45.947
And even if I wanted to,
I can't switch sides.

08:45.948 --> 08:47.313
It's a violation of professional ethics.

08:47.314 --> 08:48.514
You know that.

08:49.448 --> 08:51.914
I'm sorry.

09:05.881 --> 09:08.780
Will I see you again
while you're still in town?

09:08.781 --> 09:09.980
Absolutely.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.714
In court, Goliath.

09:16.348 --> 09:17.780
I'm really sorry.

09:17.781 --> 09:19.376
Then quit.

09:22.848 --> 09:31.017
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

09:37.909 --> 09:39.041
How was dinner?

09:39.042 --> 09:40.508
Oof. Never even got to dinner.

09:40.509 --> 09:42.641
Well, that sounds like fun.

09:42.642 --> 09:44.141
Or not.

09:44.142 --> 09:46.274
I'm expecting our new clients
in about a half hour.

09:46.275 --> 09:48.071
I have nothing for them.

09:48.742 --> 09:50.208
Bring them to the mock courtroom,

09:50.209 --> 09:51.674
- make sure everybody's there.
- Got it.

09:51.675 --> 09:52.908
Yeah, I should warn you, Bull,

09:52.909 --> 09:54.674
Chunk's been looking
for you all morning.

09:54.675 --> 09:56.141
- What does he want?
- I don't know.

09:56.142 --> 09:58.674
But he's... dressed strangely.

09:58.675 --> 10:01.084
Really? How can you tell?

10:03.975 --> 10:05.463
Who died?

10:05.842 --> 10:06.908
Pardon me?

10:06.909 --> 10:08.374
You're pardoned.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.042
What else can I do for you?

10:14.309 --> 10:15.908
You're serving me with a summons?

10:19.185 --> 10:20.941
You took the LSAT.

10:20.942 --> 10:24.074
- Law School Admission Test.
- Yep.

10:24.075 --> 10:26.208
167 out of 180.

10:26.209 --> 10:27.774
That's impressive.

10:27.775 --> 10:29.274
Congratulations.

10:29.275 --> 10:30.808
So you're thinking of
going to law school?

10:30.809 --> 10:32.074
I'm not thinking about it,

10:32.075 --> 10:33.641
I'm doing it.

10:33.642 --> 10:36.741
I got accepted to Vanderbilt
in Nashville.

10:36.742 --> 10:38.108
Starting in January.

10:38.109 --> 10:39.541
Vanderbilt. Nashville.

10:39.542 --> 10:40.674
That's a hell of commute.

10:41.207 --> 10:43.474
I don't know how to swing it
in New York.

10:43.475 --> 10:45.074
Even going to school at night,

10:45.075 --> 10:46.774
the cost of living on top of tuition...

10:46.775 --> 10:48.541
Is this a pitch for a raise?

10:48.542 --> 10:50.308
I'm not pitching you anything.

10:50.309 --> 10:53.178
This is me trying to be honorable.

10:53.642 --> 10:54.908
Telling you what's going on.

10:54.909 --> 10:56.808
So, if I gave you a raise

10:56.809 --> 10:58.708
and if you went
to law school at night...

10:58.709 --> 11:00.074
Well, that's a lot of ifs, Bull.

11:00.075 --> 11:02.008
Are you offering me a raise?

11:02.009 --> 11:04.741
Honestly, Chunk, I don't know if I can.

11:04.742 --> 11:07.224
I have to consult with a higher power.

11:07.225 --> 11:09.108
I don't understand.
I just gave you a check

11:09.109 --> 11:10.808
for a quarter of a million
dollars yesterday.

11:10.809 --> 11:12.941
Uh, Bull, that check just
barely got us back to even.

11:12.942 --> 11:14.208
How is that possible?

11:14.209 --> 11:16.441
Look around. This fabulous office space,

11:16.442 --> 11:19.241
all this equipment, all those employees.

11:19.242 --> 11:21.041
Every time you hold a mock trial,

11:21.042 --> 11:22.808
we have to pay people
to sit on the jury.

11:22.809 --> 11:24.408
Every time we have a client meeting,

11:24.409 --> 11:25.409
you want it catered.

11:25.410 --> 11:26.974
When you fly, it's first class.

11:26.975 --> 11:29.041
When you stay in a hotel,
it's a suite, not a room.

11:29.042 --> 11:31.841
And it should be.
I'm a very successful person.

11:31.842 --> 11:34.208
Come on. Image is important.

11:34.209 --> 11:37.108
I'm going in and I'm telling
lawyers, company presidents,

11:37.109 --> 11:39.808
people accused of very
serious crimes, what to do,

11:39.809 --> 11:41.808
how to dress, how to speak.

11:41.809 --> 11:43.708
No one is going to listen to me
if I take the bus

11:43.709 --> 11:44.974
and sleep at the local campground.

11:44.975 --> 11:45.942
I'm sorry.

11:45.943 --> 11:47.441
You cannot give Chunk a raise.

11:47.442 --> 11:48.608
You just can't afford it.

11:49.025 --> 11:50.674
But I don't want to lose him.

11:50.675 --> 11:53.308
Well, neither do I,
but if you give Chunk a raise,

11:53.309 --> 11:54.474
everyone else is gonna want one.

11:54.475 --> 11:56.908
Benny, Danny, Cable.
Look, I would like a raise.

11:56.909 --> 11:58.308
I have not had a raise in three years.

11:58.309 --> 12:00.741
No.

12:00.742 --> 12:02.008
No, I just gave you a raise.

12:02.009 --> 12:03.608
Remember? I called you from New Jersey.

12:03.609 --> 12:05.141
Seahawks were playing the Broncos.

12:05.142 --> 12:06.142
It was the Superbowl.

12:06.143 --> 12:07.508
I was in the skybox.

12:07.509 --> 12:09.074
It was between quarters and...

12:09.075 --> 12:11.574
"Gangnam Style" was playing
on the stadium P.A.

12:12.006 --> 12:13.541
So, did you use a cell phone

12:13.542 --> 12:15.274
or was it the kind you had to crank?

12:15.275 --> 12:17.074
Yeah. I guess you're right.

12:17.075 --> 12:18.174
Time flies when you're not making money.

12:18.175 --> 12:20.008
Our new clients are here.

12:20.009 --> 12:22.308
This conversation is not over.

12:22.309 --> 12:23.741
Bull, you don't have any money.

12:23.742 --> 12:25.061
There's nothing to talk about.

12:26.271 --> 12:27.408
And then...

12:27.409 --> 12:30.008
we'll work with the DA
to pick the perfect jury.

12:30.009 --> 12:33.341
And by monitoring the
reactions of our mirror jury,

12:33.342 --> 12:36.041
we will know at the end of each day

12:36.042 --> 12:39.508
how our case is being presented
and what changes we need to make

12:39.509 --> 12:43.274
to realize the best outcome
for our client.

12:43.275 --> 12:44.974
Very impressive.

12:44.975 --> 12:46.208
Uh, Dr. Bull...

12:46.209 --> 12:48.074
But it starts with the narrative.

12:48.075 --> 12:51.841
The story we tell that
makes sense of what happened,

12:51.842 --> 12:56.108
but also supports our version
of the facts and leads everyone,

12:56.109 --> 12:59.442
the judge and the jury,
to the same conclusion.

13:01.242 --> 13:02.515
The narrative.

13:03.275 --> 13:04.684
Which...

13:05.875 --> 13:07.442
I don't have yet.

13:10.442 --> 13:11.441
Dr. Bull,

13:11.442 --> 13:13.608
any way we can speak privately?

13:13.609 --> 13:14.909
Of course.

13:20.809 --> 13:22.508
Our job is

13:22.509 --> 13:24.274
to protect the Clayton estate.

13:24.275 --> 13:26.508
If Mrs. Clayton recovers
from her injuries...

13:26.509 --> 13:28.008
and from all appearances,

13:28.009 --> 13:29.608
that's what's gonna happen...

13:29.609 --> 13:34.108
she effectively becomes the new
owner of Clayton Communications.

13:34.109 --> 13:35.774
And as you can imagine,

13:35.775 --> 13:39.708
Clayton's four grown children
are not fond of that scenario,

13:39.709 --> 13:41.808
nor is the current board of directors.

13:41.809 --> 13:43.808
Which is our way of saying

13:43.809 --> 13:47.941
we understand it's hard to come
up with a strategy for a case

13:47.942 --> 13:51.842
that sure looks like
justifiable self-defense.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.641
You lost me at "we understand."

13:57.779 --> 13:59.008
We may go to court.

13:59.009 --> 14:00.741
We may even go to criminal court,

14:00.742 --> 14:02.241
but that's not our goal.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.374
That's not our endgame.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.408
We look at this as a negotiation.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.274
Ah.

14:07.275 --> 14:08.774
So, anything less than her walking away

14:08.775 --> 14:10.674
with 100% of the company
is a win for you.

14:11.125 --> 14:12.174
Exactly.

14:12.175 --> 14:15.508
And I'm guessing you'd actually
be willing to forego

14:15.509 --> 14:18.474
the whole murder trial
if there was a number

14:18.475 --> 14:21.241
that you and Mrs. Clayton
could agree on. Right?

14:21.242 --> 14:22.308
Like I said,

14:22.309 --> 14:24.374
we look at this as a negotiation.

14:24.639 --> 14:26.308
Mm-hmm.

14:26.683 --> 14:27.808
Give me a figure.

14:28.226 --> 14:29.304
Why?

14:29.305 --> 14:31.308
'Cause I may be able to sew
this whole thing up for you

14:31.309 --> 14:32.875
in the next 48 hours.

14:35.984 --> 14:37.674
500 million.

14:37.675 --> 14:39.201
Half a billion dollars.

14:39.202 --> 14:40.574
And she agrees to give up

14:40.575 --> 14:42.508
any rights or ownership in the company.

14:42.509 --> 14:45.274
Sounds like a terrific
conversation starter to me.

14:45.275 --> 14:46.841
Just one more thing.

14:46.842 --> 14:51.308
If you don't go to court
and I am instrumental

14:51.309 --> 14:53.341
in helping you solve your problem,

14:53.876 --> 14:56.042
I still get the other 250, right?

14:57.875 --> 15:00.591
If you put our little problem to bed...

15:01.209 --> 15:02.774
I'll make it 350.

15:07.042 --> 15:09.241
Yes! Damn, I'm smart!

15:09.242 --> 15:10.841
Damn, I'm smart.

15:10.842 --> 15:11.941
Damn, I'm smart.

15:11.942 --> 15:13.508
Damn, I'm smart.

15:15.809 --> 15:16.874
Diana, it's Bull.

15:16.875 --> 15:17.974
Can we talk?

15:17.975 --> 15:19.774
Did you quit yet?

15:19.775 --> 15:21.875
No, but I...

15:27.009 --> 15:28.541
Diana, you don't understand.

15:28.542 --> 15:30.141
I am gonna make you a winner,

15:30.142 --> 15:32.074
a giant winner.

15:32.790 --> 15:34.242
Diana?

15:37.375 --> 15:39.008
Cable, call the Oxwald Hotel,

15:39.009 --> 15:41.308
- ask for Diana Lindsay.
- Sir, yes, sir!

15:41.309 --> 15:42.908
Hey. They didn't fire us, did they?

15:42.909 --> 15:45.974
- Fire us?
- Okay. Uh, she checked out.

15:45.975 --> 15:48.238
Danny, find out what hotel
Diana Lindsay checked into.

15:48.239 --> 15:49.409
On it.

15:58.909 --> 16:01.108
Hey, aren't you that fantastic lawyer

16:01.109 --> 16:03.174
who got that amazing
settlement for that woman

16:03.175 --> 16:04.741
who shot her billionaire husband?

16:04.742 --> 16:06.542
This man is stalking me.

16:08.442 --> 16:10.942
Sir. Hey, get the door. Stop him.

16:12.609 --> 16:15.416
Guys, let me out of here, please.

16:16.275 --> 16:18.074
That's my wife. She needs a kidney.

16:18.075 --> 16:19.575
I've decided to give her mine.

16:27.809 --> 16:30.341
Oh. I'm excited to see you, too.

16:30.342 --> 16:32.641
- Get out.
- Is that any way to speak to someone

16:32.642 --> 16:34.308
who's about to make you
the most talked about attorney

16:34.309 --> 16:35.708
in New York? It's okay, driver.

16:35.709 --> 16:37.408
You can drive. Just a lover's spat.

16:37.409 --> 16:39.341
No, driver. We are not lovers.

16:39.342 --> 16:41.174
Well, not this minute, but it's early.

16:41.175 --> 16:42.474
I am not talking to you.

16:42.475 --> 16:44.008
You are not a good friend.

16:44.009 --> 16:46.374
Why? Because I won't renege
on a professional commitment

16:46.375 --> 16:47.774
the second you snap your fingers?

16:47.775 --> 16:49.741
And for the record, I am a great friend.

16:49.742 --> 16:50.974
I am a fantastic friend.

16:50.975 --> 16:54.341
I am the Rachel of friends,
if Rachel were a boy.

16:54.342 --> 16:55.974
You used to be so smart.

16:55.975 --> 16:58.369
That not withstanding,
I'd like to proffer a settlement

16:58.370 --> 16:59.874
from Clayton Communications
and the Clayton family.

16:59.875 --> 17:00.974
Well, you can save your breath

17:00.975 --> 17:02.508
because we are not interested
in settling.

17:02.509 --> 17:03.409
But you haven't heard the offer.

17:03.410 --> 17:05.008
I don't need to hear the offer.

17:05.009 --> 17:05.974
Take a million dollars...

17:05.976 --> 17:07.874
You take a million dollars.

17:07.875 --> 17:09.840
...and multiply it by 500.

17:09.842 --> 17:10.973
Wait, my mistake.

17:10.974 --> 17:12.141
Let me put it in another way.

17:12.142 --> 17:16.074
Take a billion dollars
and divide it in half.

17:16.477 --> 17:18.208
Is this for real?

17:18.209 --> 17:19.641
Doesn't get any realer.

17:19.939 --> 17:21.374
Call your client.

17:21.566 --> 17:23.040
Tell her the good news.

17:23.041 --> 17:25.441
Actually, I'm on my way
to see her right now.

17:25.442 --> 17:26.779
We can tell her together.

17:28.156 --> 17:30.032
Hello, Mrs. Clayton.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.041
Hi. It's nice to see you again.

17:33.042 --> 17:34.208
This is a friend of mine.

17:34.209 --> 17:35.908
Great friend, fantastic friend.

17:35.909 --> 17:37.474
Dr. Jason Bull.

17:37.475 --> 17:39.108
Forgive me for not getting up.

17:39.109 --> 17:42.241
This is a hyperbaric oxygen chamber.

17:42.628 --> 17:45.006
I spend two hours a day in here.

17:45.082 --> 17:47.015
It's supposed to help my wounds heal.

17:47.409 --> 17:49.074
But I'm sure you know
all about that, Doctor.

17:49.075 --> 17:51.674
Uh, no, he's not that
kind of doctor, Kara.

17:51.675 --> 17:53.641
He's working with the Clayton family,

17:53.642 --> 17:55.185
the legal team.

17:55.186 --> 17:58.709
They have a proposition
they would like to discuss.

18:01.135 --> 18:02.941
Thank you for seeing me.

18:02.942 --> 18:04.141
I realize this has been a horrible

18:04.142 --> 18:07.541
and traumatic experience and that, uh,

18:07.542 --> 18:10.074
talk of money and settlements must seem

18:10.075 --> 18:12.608
disconcerting at the very least.

18:12.609 --> 18:14.941
Nonetheless, the Claytons did ask me

18:14.942 --> 18:17.074
to convey a proposition to you.

18:17.075 --> 18:19.574
In return for your agreeing
to give up any rights

18:19.575 --> 18:23.308
or ownership of the company,
the Clayton Communications Group

18:23.309 --> 18:26.741
will use its considerable clout
to convince the DA

18:26.742 --> 18:28.308
to drop all the charges against you

18:28.309 --> 18:30.808
related to the death
of your late husband.

18:30.809 --> 18:33.141
The board of directors has
authorized me to offer you

18:33.142 --> 18:37.875
the sum of one half
billion dollars, tax free.

18:46.742 --> 18:48.008
I'm sure this is something

18:48.009 --> 18:49.141
you're gonna want to think about.

18:49.142 --> 18:52.574
Discuss with your counsel, your family.

18:52.575 --> 18:54.374
Diana knows how to get in touch with me

18:54.375 --> 18:55.609
when you've come to a decision.

18:57.442 --> 18:58.996
Doctor.

19:00.442 --> 19:04.775
Do you have any idea how much
Clayton Communications is worth?

19:06.975 --> 19:10.140
Last estimate I read was
about six billion dollars.

19:10.141 --> 19:12.208
And under a normal circumstance,

19:12.209 --> 19:15.308
since my husband was
the sole owner of the company,

19:15.309 --> 19:18.974
it would pass in its entirety
to me. Isn't that correct?

19:18.975 --> 19:21.908
These are not normal
circumstances, Mrs. Clayton.

19:23.020 --> 19:25.241
Have you ever been stabbed, Doctor?

19:25.690 --> 19:28.042
Can't say that I have.

19:29.842 --> 19:32.345
Three things went through
my mind while it was happening.

19:33.709 --> 19:35.324
First, there's the pain.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.108
The surgeons here said that
it's a miracle I'm alive.

19:39.109 --> 19:42.475
The chest wound missed my heart
by just a centimeter.

19:44.458 --> 19:46.641
Then there's the realization that

19:47.044 --> 19:50.172
the person doing it
pledged his life to me,

19:50.642 --> 19:53.774
sworn his love to me
over and over again,

19:53.775 --> 19:59.441
and yet his face was filled
with nothing but hate, loathing.

20:00.725 --> 20:02.074
And then there's the business

20:02.075 --> 20:04.228
of will I survive this?

20:07.940 --> 20:09.609
Turns out I will.

20:11.409 --> 20:13.195
Tell them I want all of it.

20:14.009 --> 20:16.073
The whole six billion.

20:16.775 --> 20:18.274
Take me to court.

20:18.576 --> 20:19.974
Try me for murder.

20:19.975 --> 20:23.074
Tell them they can try
whatever they want.

20:23.075 --> 20:24.809
It's all gonna be mine.

20:27.409 --> 20:29.274
It's not too late to quit.

20:29.275 --> 20:31.941
I agree. You should definitely
give that some thought.

20:31.942 --> 20:33.341
Me?

20:33.342 --> 20:34.634
Darlin'...

20:35.475 --> 20:37.609
that woman's lying.

20:45.716 --> 20:48.735
The challenge is we all think
we know what happened.

20:48.736 --> 20:51.819
Woman's been stabbed, man's been shot.

20:51.920 --> 20:53.319
We just fill in the middle.

20:53.320 --> 20:56.452
But the truth is, we don't really know.

20:56.453 --> 21:00.119
So, this is the proposition
you wanted to discuss?

21:00.120 --> 21:01.886
You want us to pick up the phone,

21:01.887 --> 21:05.186
make a big contribution to the
DA's re-election campaign

21:05.187 --> 21:07.652
and twist his arm to press charges

21:07.653 --> 21:10.153
because you have a hunch?

21:12.120 --> 21:14.452
Oh, it's more than a hunch.

21:14.453 --> 21:16.019
It's what I do for a living.

21:16.020 --> 21:17.787
The woman is lying.

21:18.887 --> 21:20.319
There was emotion, but it was

21:20.320 --> 21:21.519
the wrong emotion.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.719
It was crystal clear, no confusion.

21:23.720 --> 21:26.219
Almost as if it had been written,

21:26.220 --> 21:27.686
as if it had been rehearsed,

21:27.687 --> 21:32.019
as if she'd been contemplating
it for a long time.

21:32.020 --> 21:34.786
And I don't know why she's
not telling the truth

21:34.787 --> 21:36.486
and I certainly don't know
what happened that night,

21:36.487 --> 21:39.752
but I do know she is lying.

21:39.753 --> 21:42.152
Correct me if I'm wrong, Dr. Bull,

21:42.153 --> 21:46.055
but with a murder trial, you
need all 12 jurors to convict.

21:46.056 --> 21:47.253
That's correct.

21:47.254 --> 21:49.083
That's a very high bar.

21:49.853 --> 21:52.052
I'm tempted to say an impossible bar.

21:52.053 --> 21:54.286
Gentlemen. What do you have to lose?

21:54.287 --> 21:55.586
You've already paid me.

21:55.587 --> 21:59.019
If we don't win,
I cost you nothing more.

21:59.020 --> 22:01.119
But if we do win, you,

22:01.120 --> 22:03.386
the board, the entire Clayton family

22:03.387 --> 22:05.052
get to keep their company.

22:05.053 --> 22:07.652
Their legacy, their everything.

22:07.653 --> 22:09.719
Again, I got to tell you, the DA

22:09.720 --> 22:12.286
doesn't want to touch this
with a ten-foot pole.

22:12.287 --> 22:14.016
Well, tell them they don't have to.

22:14.017 --> 22:15.952
All they need to do is file the charges.

22:15.953 --> 22:18.652
Have them appoint
my in-house counsel Benny Colón

22:18.653 --> 22:20.219
as special assistant DA.

22:20.220 --> 22:21.519
He used to work there.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.219
That'll give the DA
plausible deniability

22:23.220 --> 22:24.586
and give me more control.

22:25.161 --> 22:26.652
He can do that?

22:26.677 --> 22:29.543
It's rare, but it's done.

22:30.040 --> 22:33.719
A lot of it hinges on the size
of your campaign contribution.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.719
And what is it you're
looking for in return

22:35.720 --> 22:39.919
for battling this particular
windmill, Dr. Quixote?

22:41.253 --> 22:43.786
Just the $250,000 bonus you promised me,

22:43.787 --> 22:46.486
and a law school scholarship fund

22:46.487 --> 22:48.086
for a person of my choosing.

22:48.087 --> 22:49.386
Any school in New York.

22:49.387 --> 22:50.986
You cover tuition and books

22:50.987 --> 22:53.287
for as long as it takes him or her.

22:56.025 --> 22:57.219
Done.

22:57.220 --> 22:59.087
See you in court, Dr. Bull.

23:01.853 --> 23:03.919
Ladies and gentlemen.

23:03.920 --> 23:05.852
Let's begin voir dire.

23:05.853 --> 23:08.252
The world's already made up
its mind about this case.

23:08.253 --> 23:10.152
So, what we're looking for

23:10.153 --> 23:12.286
are jurors with more
intellectual curiosity

23:12.287 --> 23:13.386
than certainty.

23:13.387 --> 23:15.652
The intellectual curiosity to at least

23:15.653 --> 23:17.486
consider the possibility
that one plus two

23:17.487 --> 23:18.652
doesn't always equal three.

23:18.653 --> 23:19.852
Be willing

23:19.853 --> 23:21.852
to search for the conclusions,

23:21.853 --> 23:23.552
rather than leaping to them.

23:23.553 --> 23:25.152
So a friend takes you to a restaurant

23:25.153 --> 23:26.352
you've never been to before.

23:26.353 --> 23:28.719
It's the hottest reservation in town.

23:28.720 --> 23:30.052
The waiter comes over and says

23:30.053 --> 23:31.886
there's an amazing special that night.

23:31.887 --> 23:33.854
Something you've never heard of before.

23:34.287 --> 23:35.652
What do you do?

23:35.653 --> 23:38.052
Do you ask him what's in it?

23:38.053 --> 23:40.352
Do you look around the room
to see who else is eating it?

23:40.353 --> 23:42.552
Do you look up the recipe on your phone?

23:42.553 --> 23:44.686
Me? Uh...

23:44.687 --> 23:46.319
Probably order something I know.

23:46.320 --> 23:48.420
- Something tried and true.
- Smart.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.719
Move to strike, Your Honor.

23:52.720 --> 23:54.952
That's a list of everyone
in the jury pool.

23:54.953 --> 23:57.386
You each have 15 names and 24 hours.

23:57.387 --> 23:59.452
I want to know everything
about everybody on that list.

23:59.453 --> 24:01.775
Where they work, where
they went to school.

24:01.776 --> 24:03.352
Everywhere they ever lived,
who they married,

24:03.353 --> 24:04.452
who they divorced

24:04.453 --> 24:06.252
and who they wish they'd married.

24:06.575 --> 24:08.552
Why do people get married?

24:09.098 --> 24:12.452
Uh, people get married
for a lot of different reasons.

24:12.453 --> 24:13.886
Name a couple.

24:13.887 --> 24:15.086
Children.

24:15.087 --> 24:16.719
Companionship.

24:16.720 --> 24:17.819
Uh, security.

24:17.820 --> 24:20.252
- Now, when you say "security..."
- I, uh...

24:20.253 --> 24:21.319
Money.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.286
I...

24:23.287 --> 24:26.286
Okay. Well, let me ask you a question.

24:26.287 --> 24:29.952
Do you think that you can
just look at a couple

24:29.953 --> 24:31.719
and know why they got married?

24:32.204 --> 24:35.186
Oh, that's a... great question.

24:35.187 --> 24:36.792
Well, that's a good answer.

24:39.279 --> 24:41.452
Acceptable to the prosecution,
Your Honor.

24:41.453 --> 24:43.552
Defense moves to strike, Your Honor.

24:43.553 --> 24:47.386
I've known Diana a long time.

24:47.387 --> 24:48.886
And she's really smart.

24:48.887 --> 24:51.986
She knows what it is I do,
and she understands a lot

24:51.987 --> 24:53.452
about how it works.

24:53.453 --> 24:56.552
So we got to stay on our toes.

24:56.553 --> 24:58.352
What do you do for a living?

24:58.353 --> 24:59.486
I'm an actress.

24:59.487 --> 25:01.486
A professional dissembler. I love it.

25:01.487 --> 25:04.786
Nobody can spot a liar
faster than another liar.

25:04.787 --> 25:07.686
Now, is that how you
actually make your living?

25:07.687 --> 25:10.152
Well, not most of the time.

25:10.153 --> 25:12.886
I guess you could say,
I'm a motivational speaker.

25:12.887 --> 25:14.019
Really?

25:14.020 --> 25:16.719
Now, what is it that you
motivate people to do?

25:16.999 --> 25:18.552
Buy things.

25:18.553 --> 25:20.652
- Ah.
- So you're in sales?

25:20.653 --> 25:23.419
I guess that's another way of saying it.

25:23.420 --> 25:25.119
This one's a firecracker.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.919
So what is it that
you motivate people to buy?

25:28.302 --> 25:31.052
Whatever it is you need me to sell.

25:31.053 --> 25:32.419
I think I'm in love.

25:32.420 --> 25:34.219
This woman can see
the virtue in anything

25:34.220 --> 25:37.486
and then do everything she can
to sell it to everybody else.

25:37.487 --> 25:39.519
With any luck,
she'll be our jury foreman.

25:39.520 --> 25:41.252
So a friend takes you to a restaurant

25:41.253 --> 25:42.785
that you've never been to before...

25:42.786 --> 25:45.486
I tell the waiter to surprise me.

25:45.487 --> 25:47.719
The more unexpected, the better.

25:47.720 --> 25:48.852
Are you listening to this?

25:48.853 --> 25:50.520
It's positively pornographic.

25:51.453 --> 25:53.620
Yeah.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.086
This juror is acceptable
to the prosecution,

25:56.087 --> 25:57.552
Your Honor.

25:57.553 --> 25:59.152
Well, she's not acceptable
to the defense.

25:59.153 --> 26:00.619
We vote to strike this juror.

26:00.620 --> 26:01.886
I think we hit a nerve.

26:01.887 --> 26:03.052
The defense

26:03.053 --> 26:05.152
has already exhausted all her strikes.

26:05.714 --> 26:07.919
You may be seated with the jury.

26:07.920 --> 26:09.119
Ladies and gentlemen.

26:09.120 --> 26:11.086
9:00 tomorrow morning,

26:11.087 --> 26:12.586
let the games begin.

26:12.587 --> 26:13.953
Swing and a miss.

26:32.798 --> 26:35.070
Sounds like you're at a Yankees game.

26:35.071 --> 26:37.371
More like a bullfight. No pun intended.

26:47.727 --> 26:49.070
No photos.

26:49.071 --> 26:51.437
No photography allowed in the courtroom.

26:51.438 --> 26:53.638
No photos!

26:57.138 --> 26:58.670
Lady knows how to make an entrance.

26:58.671 --> 26:59.803
Mm-hmm.

26:59.804 --> 27:02.771
God had some party the
night he cooked her up.

27:03.404 --> 27:04.970
So it is your testimony

27:04.971 --> 27:07.470
as Marcus Clayton's principal counsel,

27:07.471 --> 27:09.703
that the defendant
and Mr. Clayton entered

27:09.704 --> 27:12.703
into a prenuptial agreement
prior to their marriage.

27:12.704 --> 27:13.770
Yes.

27:13.771 --> 27:16.003
It was very important to Mr. Clayton

27:16.004 --> 27:18.037
that there be no misunderstandings

27:18.038 --> 27:20.403
should either he or Mrs. Clayton

27:20.404 --> 27:22.037
decide to dissolve

27:22.038 --> 27:24.103
the marriage at some later date.

27:24.104 --> 27:25.403
So can you explain to us how this

27:25.404 --> 27:26.937
prenuptial agreement worked?

27:26.938 --> 27:29.170
Well, without going
into too much specific detail,

27:29.171 --> 27:31.537
the agreement was structured so that

27:31.538 --> 27:35.770
as long as Mrs. Clayton met
certain weekly, monthly

27:35.771 --> 27:39.403
and yearly obligations,
with regard to travel,

27:39.404 --> 27:42.603
uh, the entertaining
of business associates

27:42.604 --> 27:44.737
or...

27:44.738 --> 27:47.903
the performance of, uh,

27:47.904 --> 27:51.270
certain, uh, intimate acts...

27:51.271 --> 27:54.337
...that are annotated in the agreement,

27:54.338 --> 27:55.737
then, over time,

27:55.738 --> 27:57.503
she would accrue a higher payout,

27:57.504 --> 28:01.337
when and if the marriage dissolved.

28:05.038 --> 28:07.570
My goodness. The level of engagement

28:07.571 --> 28:09.070
is off the charts.

28:09.071 --> 28:10.970
So, for instance...

28:10.971 --> 28:14.570
So for instance, if the marriage
had only lasted one year,

28:14.571 --> 28:16.835
and had Mrs. Clayton

28:16.836 --> 28:19.970
fulfilled her obligations
per the agreement,

28:19.971 --> 28:22.637
she would have received
one million dollars.

28:24.978 --> 28:26.170
Wow.

28:27.064 --> 28:29.537
Sounds more like a business
agreement than a, uh...

28:29.538 --> 28:31.770
I object to the inference, Your Honor.

28:31.771 --> 28:33.837
Objection sustained.

28:33.838 --> 28:36.170
Keep your opinions
to yourself, Counselor.

28:36.171 --> 28:37.703
My apologies, Your Honor.

28:37.704 --> 28:39.303
Please continue, Mr. Sinclair.

28:39.304 --> 28:41.903
Now, for every year
she stays in the marriage,

28:41.904 --> 28:44.070
the amount actually doubles.

28:44.071 --> 28:48.237
So for two years, she would've
received two million dollars.

28:48.238 --> 28:50.737
For three years, four million dollars.

28:50.738 --> 28:52.200
For four years,

28:52.201 --> 28:53.703
eight million dollars.

28:53.704 --> 28:56.403
And had the marriage ended today,

28:56.404 --> 29:01.703
Mrs. Clayton would have walked
away with $16 million.

29:06.804 --> 29:09.237
$16 million.

29:09.238 --> 29:11.370
That's... a nice payday

29:11.371 --> 29:13.837
- for five years' work.
- Your Honor.

29:13.838 --> 29:16.137
Uh... my apologies again, Your Honor.

29:16.138 --> 29:18.403
I wish you could see juror 39.

29:18.404 --> 29:20.303
She's lapping this up with a spoon.

29:20.304 --> 29:22.037
My queen bee.

29:22.038 --> 29:24.570
Counting on you to whip
the rest of the hive into shape.

29:24.571 --> 29:25.703
Let's just say,

29:25.704 --> 29:28.270
neither party wanted
the marriage to dissolve.

29:28.271 --> 29:30.403
But one of them, say, Mr. Clayton,

29:30.404 --> 29:33.637
became deathly ill and succumbed.

29:33.638 --> 29:36.570
Or was in a traffic accident
and lost his life.

29:36.571 --> 29:40.237
Or was shot point-blank range
in the chest.

29:40.238 --> 29:41.238
Objection.

29:41.239 --> 29:42.270
Overruled.

29:42.271 --> 29:43.737
But get to the question, please.

29:43.738 --> 29:46.103
What would Mrs. Clayton be looking at?

29:46.104 --> 29:47.837
Payout-wise?

29:47.838 --> 29:50.237
Well, minus some stipulations
in his will

29:50.238 --> 29:52.941
with regard to his four children,

29:53.471 --> 29:56.103
she would inherit everything.

29:56.104 --> 29:58.203
Meaning...?

29:58.204 --> 30:01.103
The entire Clayton
Communications empire.

30:01.104 --> 30:02.203
Which is worth...?

30:02.204 --> 30:03.270
As of today?

30:03.271 --> 30:06.670
$6.65 billion.

30:11.038 --> 30:13.203
Wow. Talk about establishing motive.

30:13.204 --> 30:16.237
Eight of the mirror jurors
who were totally on Diana's side

30:16.238 --> 30:18.437
just moved over to ours.

30:19.009 --> 30:23.472
Thank you, Mr. Sinclair, for
that illuminating explanation.

30:24.431 --> 30:26.037
I just have one question.

30:26.808 --> 30:29.070
How much would Mrs. Clayton
have received

30:29.071 --> 30:31.670
had she been stabbed to death?

30:34.438 --> 30:36.170
Hmm.

30:36.735 --> 30:38.570
Never mind.

30:38.871 --> 30:40.489
I withdraw the question.

30:41.406 --> 30:42.903
Forget I said that.

30:42.904 --> 30:45.437
Three of the eight went back to Diana.

30:45.438 --> 30:49.737
Hey, we still ended up with
five more than we came in with.

30:49.738 --> 30:51.037
See you when I see you.

30:51.038 --> 30:52.637
See you when I see you.

30:52.638 --> 30:54.937
Yes, that trial.

30:54.938 --> 30:58.603
Uh-huh. Well, I know you're
hearing about it on TV,

30:58.604 --> 31:00.133
but I'm there.

31:00.538 --> 31:02.603
All right. Okay. I love you too, Mama.

31:02.604 --> 31:03.637
Bye.

31:04.471 --> 31:06.137
I'm sorry.

31:06.138 --> 31:07.470
Couldn't help but overhear.

31:07.471 --> 31:09.037
Was that a Texas accent?

31:09.038 --> 31:10.537
Well, it sure was.

31:10.538 --> 31:12.203
Oh. Whereabouts?

31:12.204 --> 31:13.903
Callisto, Texas?

31:13.904 --> 31:14.937
You ever heard of it?

31:14.938 --> 31:16.970
Actually, I have.

31:19.571 --> 31:21.655
Who vetted juror 39?

31:23.740 --> 31:25.103
I did.

31:25.104 --> 31:26.937
She's from Callisto.

31:26.938 --> 31:28.870
Callisto, Texas!

31:28.871 --> 31:31.103
The same town as Diana.

31:31.104 --> 31:33.370
You didn't see that?
That didn't ring any bells?

31:33.371 --> 31:35.370
Wasn't something you thought
I might want to know about?

31:35.371 --> 31:37.670
What exactly are you saying, Bull?

31:37.671 --> 31:39.047
I'm saying she's a plant.

31:39.538 --> 31:41.203
Oh.

31:41.204 --> 31:42.703
Diana set me up.

31:42.704 --> 31:45.837
She suckered me in
hook, line and sinker.

31:45.838 --> 31:48.737
I need all 12 jurors,

31:48.738 --> 31:52.561
and now, no matter what happens
in that courtroom,

31:53.438 --> 31:55.638
I will only have 11.

32:10.072 --> 32:11.670
Good evening. Affilian Hotel.

32:11.671 --> 32:13.670
Diana Lindsay, room 1667.

32:13.671 --> 32:14.871
Please hold.

32:17.438 --> 32:19.470
- Hello?
- I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

32:19.471 --> 32:22.170
I'm impressed you can sleep
with so much on your conscience.

32:22.171 --> 32:24.337
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

32:24.338 --> 32:26.770
Well, let's start
with your lying client,

32:26.771 --> 32:29.270
and then move to the ringer
you snuck on the jury.

32:29.271 --> 32:30.870
Yeah, okay, I'm hanging up now.

32:30.871 --> 32:32.237
Oh, you do that, Diana.

32:32.238 --> 32:34.337
'Cause I don't care
about you or your ringers.

32:34.338 --> 32:36.303
I'm going to present
such an effective case

32:36.304 --> 32:37.670
the jury's gonna come back 11 to one,

32:37.671 --> 32:39.337
the judge will declare a mistrial,

32:39.338 --> 32:40.703
and we will be back in six months.

32:40.704 --> 32:43.170
And I will personally send your client

32:43.171 --> 32:44.503
to the electric chair.

32:44.504 --> 32:46.403
Jason Bull, you are simultaneously

32:46.404 --> 32:47.970
one of the smartest men I have ever met

32:47.971 --> 32:49.470
and one of the dumbest.

32:49.471 --> 32:51.337
Well, clearly, you don't
meet enough people.

32:51.338 --> 32:52.937
Look...

32:52.938 --> 32:55.637
I don't even know
what juror you're talking about.

32:55.638 --> 32:58.903
And as far as my client lying?
Well, I beg to differ.

32:58.904 --> 33:01.837
In fact, she is so anxious
to tell her story

33:01.838 --> 33:03.870
that she has insisted
I put her on the stand tomorrow.

33:03.871 --> 33:06.470
Oh... I don't care
if you put her on the stand,

33:06.471 --> 33:07.803
I don't care if she takes the Fifth.

33:07.804 --> 33:09.470
I don't care if she drinks a fifth.

33:09.471 --> 33:11.537
Your client is lying.

33:11.538 --> 33:13.837
Would you like to know how I know?

33:13.838 --> 33:15.737
Guys with more money than God,

33:15.738 --> 33:18.803
they don't stab the women
they want to get rid of.

33:18.804 --> 33:19.870
They pay them!

33:19.871 --> 33:22.570
"Here's $100 million. Go away."

33:22.571 --> 33:23.937
It's clean, it's quick,

33:23.938 --> 33:25.303
and everybody gets what they want.

33:25.304 --> 33:27.370
And that is how I know
your client did it.

33:27.371 --> 33:30.003
He didn't want out, she did.

33:31.671 --> 33:33.471
Hello?

33:34.044 --> 33:35.510
Hello?

33:35.738 --> 33:37.603
Hmm.

33:37.604 --> 33:40.237
If you're here
to apologize, you're too late.

33:40.238 --> 33:42.170
You better check the
temperature in hell.

33:42.171 --> 33:43.937
I haven't come to apologize.

33:43.938 --> 33:45.637
I haven't done anything wrong.

33:45.638 --> 33:49.003
You gave me 15 people
to check out in 24 hours,

33:49.004 --> 33:50.887
and I missed something.

33:51.338 --> 33:53.103
It's human, Dr. Bull.

33:53.104 --> 33:56.137
And it mystifies me that you can
know so much and not know that.

33:56.138 --> 33:57.570
You're the second woman to tell me

33:57.571 --> 33:59.937
how much I do and don't know
in the last ten minutes.

33:59.938 --> 34:01.437
I'm starting to take offense.

34:01.438 --> 34:04.470
Well, maybe you should listen,
because three minutes ago,

34:04.471 --> 34:07.570
I realized that, uh,
you missed something, too.

34:07.571 --> 34:09.803
What's this? The evidence file?

34:09.804 --> 34:11.003
I've already been through this.

34:11.004 --> 34:12.136
There's nothing in here.

34:12.137 --> 34:14.937
Yeah, that's what you missed...
the nothing.

34:14.938 --> 34:16.536
Look at the gun.

34:18.170 --> 34:19.503
There's nothing to look at.

34:19.833 --> 34:21.370
There's no prints on the gun.

34:21.371 --> 34:24.536
Exactly. She shot him three times.

34:24.538 --> 34:27.204
Yeah? How is that possible?

34:29.138 --> 34:30.469
I don't know.

34:31.538 --> 34:33.437
But I know who to ask.

34:34.264 --> 34:36.070
You can say thank you, now.

34:36.071 --> 34:37.391
Thank you.

34:39.728 --> 34:41.938
And I'm sorry.

34:43.737 --> 34:46.070
Any chance I could convince you to stay

34:46.071 --> 34:48.152
and help me figure out what this means?

34:52.170 --> 34:53.438
Okay.

34:58.471 --> 35:01.037
But if you ever throw something
at me again,

35:01.038 --> 35:02.837
I swear, you will live to regret it.

35:02.838 --> 35:05.604
I'm stupid, I'm not a moron.

35:13.982 --> 35:15.447
Defense calls Kara Clayton.

35:15.448 --> 35:17.682
Look at the two of them...
smug and smugger.

35:25.866 --> 35:27.192
You ready?

35:28.315 --> 35:29.614
Never readier.

35:30.403 --> 35:31.947
Let's talk about that night.

35:32.322 --> 35:34.074
Can you take me through what happened?

35:35.537 --> 35:39.037
My late husband was a very driven man.

35:39.448 --> 35:41.681
He was also given to paranoia.

35:41.682 --> 35:44.114
And over time, he became convinced

35:44.115 --> 35:46.147
that I was seeing someone younger.

35:46.148 --> 35:47.181
Were you?

35:47.182 --> 35:49.986
No. I loved my husband.

35:50.011 --> 35:51.876
So, on this particular night...

35:52.048 --> 35:53.581
He was trying to close a deal

35:53.582 --> 35:57.581
to buy a communications
consortium in Australia,

35:57.582 --> 35:59.781
and it wasn't going well.

36:00.141 --> 36:03.603
He called me into his study to...

36:05.021 --> 36:06.748
comfort him.

36:07.982 --> 36:09.847
And did you?

36:09.848 --> 36:11.289
No.

36:12.215 --> 36:14.414
I told him that I didn't like it
when he demanded things,

36:14.415 --> 36:18.614
that I liked it better when
things happened naturally.

36:18.615 --> 36:20.181
And then what happened?

36:20.182 --> 36:21.788
He got angry.

36:23.182 --> 36:25.882
As angry as I'd ever seen him.

36:28.048 --> 36:30.347
Accused me of having a lover.

36:30.714 --> 36:32.514
Started reminding me about our prenup,

36:32.515 --> 36:36.548
about... what I was required to do.

36:37.982 --> 36:40.081
I hate to be bearer of bad news...

36:40.082 --> 36:43.447
Please. It ain't over
till the pretty lady sings.

36:43.448 --> 36:44.514
And then?

36:44.515 --> 36:46.771
And... then he...

36:47.515 --> 36:49.983
got up from his desk,

36:50.415 --> 36:52.481
came over to me,

36:52.482 --> 36:55.196
demanded that I do what he wanted.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.158
I said no.

36:59.015 --> 37:03.947
And that's when I noticed he had
one hand behind his back.

37:03.948 --> 37:06.714
So, help me understand.

37:06.715 --> 37:09.247
He grabbed you with one hand.

37:09.628 --> 37:11.281
By the back of my neck.

37:11.282 --> 37:12.381
And his other hand?

37:12.382 --> 37:14.547
Was behind his back.

37:14.548 --> 37:17.715
That's where the knife was. That's...

37:19.015 --> 37:20.714
That's when he started stabbing me.

37:20.715 --> 37:23.048
Three times.

37:24.351 --> 37:26.114
Three times.

37:26.115 --> 37:27.881
Do you have the strength
to stand up and show us

37:27.882 --> 37:29.114
where the three wounds are?

37:29.115 --> 37:30.899
I think so.

37:37.672 --> 37:39.282
One here.

37:40.115 --> 37:43.647
They said this one just missed
my heart by maybe a centimeter.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.247
Wow.

37:45.872 --> 37:47.747
One here,

37:47.748 --> 37:49.281
and one here.

37:49.282 --> 37:50.847
And this one, too. They say this one

37:50.848 --> 37:52.347
just missed the femoral artery.

37:52.348 --> 37:53.414
Thank you, Mrs. Clayton.

37:53.415 --> 37:55.015
You can sit down now.

37:56.257 --> 37:58.315
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

38:04.082 --> 38:08.447
Mrs. Clayton, just curious...

38:08.448 --> 38:10.948
what was your major in college?

38:15.548 --> 38:16.747
Finance.

38:16.748 --> 38:18.947
Finance? Really?

38:19.389 --> 38:22.315
Huh. Now, was that always your major?

38:23.998 --> 38:26.224
Objection. Relevance.

38:26.225 --> 38:27.648
Counselor? Relevance?

38:27.649 --> 38:29.181
Your Honor,

38:29.182 --> 38:31.042
if you'll allow me to continue...

38:32.293 --> 38:35.081
I think the relevance will be obvious.

38:35.082 --> 38:36.965
Certainly to the jury.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.034
Mm, yeah. Thank you.

38:39.035 --> 38:40.847
Drumroll, please.

38:40.848 --> 38:43.147
I'm sorry, you... you were saying?

38:43.148 --> 38:45.724
What did you study prior to finance?

38:49.060 --> 38:50.314
Anatomy.

38:50.315 --> 38:51.715
Anatomy?

38:52.948 --> 38:55.381
That's the study of the human body.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.585
The internal organs.

38:57.586 --> 38:59.781
Where things are. Got it.

38:59.782 --> 39:02.147
We're starting to see movement.

39:02.148 --> 39:04.081
Buckle up,

39:04.082 --> 39:05.381
we're just getting started.

39:05.382 --> 39:06.614
I'm sorry,

39:06.615 --> 39:07.781
I got us off track here.

39:07.782 --> 39:09.714
So, your late husband was...

39:09.715 --> 39:11.207
he was stabbing you.

39:12.148 --> 39:13.514
One way up there,

39:13.515 --> 39:16.014
one way down there, one in the middle.

39:16.015 --> 39:17.647
Just missed your heart,
just missed your liver,

39:17.648 --> 39:19.814
just missed anything
of importance down there.

39:19.815 --> 39:21.781
- Objection.
- Sustained.

39:22.694 --> 39:25.314
And somehow, in the middle of all this,

39:25.548 --> 39:26.780
you grabbed a gun?

39:27.291 --> 39:29.914
There was a small table
where he always kept one.

39:29.915 --> 39:31.947
So, it was just right there.

39:31.948 --> 39:33.014
Three steps away.

39:33.015 --> 39:34.400
While you were being stabbed.

39:34.401 --> 39:35.381
Yes.

39:35.382 --> 39:37.020
- Already loaded?
- Yes.

39:37.021 --> 39:39.481
And so you grabbed the gun, and...

39:39.482 --> 39:40.614
and you shot him with it?

39:41.279 --> 39:42.181
Yes.

39:42.182 --> 39:44.981
Then why are there
no fingerprints on the gun?

39:53.348 --> 39:54.614
I don't understand.

39:54.615 --> 39:56.114
What does this have to do with anything?

39:56.115 --> 39:57.881
You shot someone three times

39:57.882 --> 39:59.748
and left no fingerprints on the gun?

40:01.615 --> 40:03.281
But I already admitted to shooting him.

40:03.282 --> 40:05.714
- Isn't that beside the point?
- Not to me.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.647
Were you wearing gloves, Mrs. Clayton?

40:07.648 --> 40:10.115
Why would I wear gloves?

40:12.315 --> 40:15.047
Why would I try to keep
my fingerprints off the gun?

40:15.048 --> 40:18.381
Not off the gun. Off the knife.

40:18.733 --> 40:21.081
When you were stabbing yourself
so you'd have an alibi

40:21.082 --> 40:22.782
for shooting your husband.

40:23.915 --> 40:25.414
And for what reason would I do that?

40:25.415 --> 40:27.114
I can think of six billion of them.

40:27.661 --> 40:29.394
Before you answer that...

40:30.548 --> 40:32.614
...and possibly perjure yourself,

40:32.615 --> 40:34.047
I should let you know that the NYPD was

40:34.048 --> 40:35.881
at your apartment early this morning,

40:35.882 --> 40:38.281
and confiscated
the contents of a shredder

40:38.282 --> 40:39.914
that was in your husband's office.

40:40.167 --> 40:41.599
It appeared to contain

40:41.624 --> 40:43.447
what was once a pair of latex gloves.

40:43.842 --> 40:46.114
The DNA results will
be in later in the day.

40:47.415 --> 40:48.481
Your witness.

40:50.982 --> 40:52.914
Order!

40:52.915 --> 40:54.818
It's a clean sweep.

40:54.843 --> 40:56.008
Nothing but green.

40:56.348 --> 40:58.414
Yeah, well, that's the mirror jury.

40:58.415 --> 41:00.715
The real one's coming in 11 to one.

41:11.177 --> 41:12.548
Have you reached a verdict?

41:12.549 --> 41:14.048
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

41:15.331 --> 41:18.150
This jury unanimously finds

41:18.768 --> 41:20.747
the defendant, Kara Clayton,

41:21.170 --> 41:23.514
guilty of first-degree murder.

41:33.482 --> 41:36.081
And as quickly as it consumed us,

41:36.082 --> 41:38.214
the scandal fades from memory,

41:38.215 --> 41:42.647
replaced by the business
of everyday life.

42:29.015 --> 42:30.547
Hey, aren't you that fantastic attorney

42:30.548 --> 42:31.847
who tried to tell me that
you'd never pull

42:31.848 --> 42:33.081
any funny stuff with the jury

42:33.082 --> 42:35.018
because you're much
better friend than I am,

42:35.019 --> 42:37.581
much better person,
much better everything?

42:38.122 --> 42:39.814
And aren't you the one who said

42:39.815 --> 42:42.047
I was representing a liar,

42:42.048 --> 42:45.281
a killer, a black widow?

42:45.713 --> 42:47.815
I guess we're even.

42:49.048 --> 42:50.681
Hmm.

42:50.682 --> 42:54.097
So, certainly got your name
in the paper a lot.

42:57.216 --> 42:58.447
Think you'll be back?

42:58.448 --> 42:59.981
Oh, you can count on it, Dr. Bull.

43:00.800 --> 43:02.281
I'm not done with you yet.

43:02.282 --> 43:04.514
I told you, I like 'em stupid.

43:04.515 --> 43:06.947
Really? Me, stupid?

43:06.948 --> 43:08.981
Mm-hmm. Give me a stupid genius

43:08.982 --> 43:11.148
over a smart idiot any day.
