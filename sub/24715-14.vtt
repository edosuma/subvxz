-JOHN: Who called it in?

00:47.881 --> 00:50.884
Old lady, lives across the street.
She heard the shots,

00:51.134 --> 00:53.511
but, uh, she didn't look
in time to see who did it.

00:53.803 --> 00:55.722
It doesn't look like a robbery.
He was shot through the window.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.849
He's wearing colors,
could be gang-related.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.601
-Worth looking into.
-Hey, who's this?

01:00.268 --> 01:03.313
-Hey, I'm Hatcher.
-And?

01:03.688 --> 01:06.316
Stan Hatcher, the borough's assigned me
to your squad.

01:06.399 --> 01:07.776
-Effective when?
-STAN: Today.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.278
-You didn't know about this?
-JOHN: Nah, first we've heard.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.363
I talked to your boss yesterday
and this morning.

01:12.489 --> 01:13.823

-So, what are we looking at here?
-Uh. DOA, black male.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.898
Uh. No witnesses, no signs of a robbery.

01:46.981 --> 01:50.360
-Wearing those colors, gotta be a blood.
-We picked up on that.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.195
Somebody should talk to the Latin Kings.

01:52.362 --> 01:54.405

Me and Andy go way back,

was a hardcore gangbanger
with Avenue D Bloods.

one of the DOA's homeboys

05:10.601 --> 05:13.146

Detective Jones, Medavoy.
Let's go talk in here.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.262
(PARROT SQUAWKING)

05:48.890 --> 05:50.600
What's your daughter's name,
Mr. Boyanovich?

05:50.767 --> 05:53.895
Carla. She's 15.

05:54.812 --> 05:57.023
She's been seeing
this boy, Charles Slocum.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.983
They go to The Kendall School.

05:59.150 --> 06:02.153
She's a sophomore.
He's a senior, rich kid.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.864
-Does that factor in?
-He factors in.

06:05.073 --> 06:09.285
He's taking her to night clubs, parties.
She starts coming home after curfew.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.497
-I called to talk to his parents.
-They aren't around.

06:13.122 --> 06:14.957
When was the last time
you saw your daughter?

06:15.041 --> 06:16.417
Two nights ago.

06:17.085 --> 06:19.921
It had been really so calm
around the house the last few weeks.

06:20.380 --> 06:24.509
She said her and Slocum broke up.
But then I get home about 9:30,

06:24.717 --> 06:26.761
and there's a note on the chalkboard
by the fridge.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.179
"You can't stop me."

06:28.805 --> 06:31.265
-Did you call Slocum's place?
-Hell, yes, I did.

06:31.349 --> 06:34.644
No answer.
So I go over his building,

06:35.019 --> 06:36.729
I watch the doorman
talk on the house phone

06:36.813 --> 06:38.189
for like, five minutes,

06:38.439 --> 06:40.733
and he's got the brass
to tell me that nobody's home.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.319
I get in his face,
he threatens to call the cops on me.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.322
-All right, we'll go talk to Slocum.
-What am I supposed to do?

06:46.697 --> 06:48.783
This kid is basically
holding my daughter hostage.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.619
Sir, understanding
how frustrating it is,

06:52.370 --> 06:56.082
we wouldn't call it a kidnapping.
It's more of a runaway situation.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.334
But you... you don't understand.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.837
Carla is a young 15.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.047
She only just started
coming out of her shell

07:03.131 --> 07:04.590
after her mom died three years ago.

07:05.216 --> 07:10.680
Then she meets this older, rich kid,
and she's completely starry-eyed.

07:11.139 --> 07:13.182
Let's concentrate on getting
your daughter home.

07:13.349 --> 07:16.519
But what this Slocum kid
is doing is criminal, right?

07:17.270 --> 07:20.398
Huh? Keeping her from me...
that's breaking the law.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.608
Give us Slocum's address.
We'll talk to him.

07:24.485 --> 07:28.197
Even though his family has money,
he don't get no special treatment, right?

07:28.823 --> 07:31.576
If we find something criminal,
he'll face charges.

a few minutes of your time.

Doesn't concern your men,
so if you ask them to step aside,

with the Avenue D Bloods

That's your girlfriend, right?

but there's no dispute with the Bloods.

You're treating me with respect,
so I'll tell you.

This morning at eight, I took my mom
to physical therapy. She's got a bad hip.

-To the Y on Sixth.

about DeKeys getting killed?

it ain't no business of the Kings.

-What's going on? Is she okay?
-You know anything about her running away?

about her dad, as usual.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.218
Or you got an old boss who doesn't wanna
go out on a limb

11:17.343 --> 11:18.636
and bad-mouth another cop,

11:18.844 --> 11:21.972
So he throws up this marshmallow word,
like "Fine."

11:22.139 --> 11:25.685
-Or that. Okay.
-Where did this guy work before the 7-2?

11:25.893 --> 11:30.314
-The 5-0. Do I need to pursue this?
-If you have some time.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.025
IRVIN: (SCREAMS, GROANS) Oh!

11:34.026 --> 11:36.821
I swear this is the first time he ever
bitten anyone other than me or the wife.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.950
I'm fine. It's not bleeding... much.
I think I'll wash this out.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.327
See, the thing is, they sense fear.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.538

around them, almost aggressive.

-He just needs time to acclimate.

-How'd it go?

11:57.758 --> 12:01.095
Uh. Lopez says the Kings aren't involved,
but Stan's got a theory.

12:01.345 --> 12:04.724
He's not copping to nothing yet.
I wanted to go down there to feel him out.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.101
We'll check out his alibi
and gear up for round two.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.438
One of the DOA's neighbors called in.
She saw the building super

12:10.604 --> 12:12.898
run to his car and take off
right after the shots.

12:13.274 --> 12:17.445
Super's name is Lonnie Parker. He's 65.
Lot of arrests back in his day.

12:17.611 --> 12:20.698
He, uh, did 15 years for a bank robbery.
Finished three years ago.

12:21.031 --> 12:23.826
So we're gonna go looking
for a 65-year-old perp?

12:24.076 --> 12:28.038
-No, we've been looking. He's in the wind.
-Yeah, he's got a son, Calvin.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.000
Works at the supermarket on First and B.
He's on his way in.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.877
We're gonna stay on the Latin King angle.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.754
-Is that cool?
-Absolutely.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.839
Nothing wrong with covering all the bases.

12:38.549 --> 12:39.884

12:40.509 --> 12:43.262
We went through the apartment.
She wasn't there.

12:43.345 --> 12:46.348

-Okay.

He said, "Maybe we should get together."
I said, "Maybe we shouldn't."

-No.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.197
-What about your mom?
-Tampa.

13:43.948 --> 13:47.243
He wouldn't dare go to her.
All he did was cause her grief.

13:47.743 --> 13:50.621
Broken promises, and that's when
he wasn't in prison.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.832
So, is there any place that you know of
that we can look for him?

-(SIGHS)
-So, what'd he do?

13:57.545 --> 13:59.088
There was a shooting.
He might have seen it.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.341
The man is 65 years old.
He's still mixed up in that bullshit.

14:02.716 --> 14:05.219
No, we're looking at him
as a possible witness that's all.

close relation,

you were at work this morning.

No, I got it. Ask for Frank,
he's my supervisor.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.439

I'm involved in something.

MADISON: Sure.

14:28.450 --> 14:31.203
Now tell me how long have you known,
uh, Carla Boyanovich?

14:31.787 --> 14:36.959
Since she started at Kendall.
Uh. Two years ago, I guess. Why?

14:37.084 --> 14:39.169
It looks like she maybe
took an unscheduled vacation

14:39.295 --> 14:41.881
without telling her dad.
You know anything about it?

14:42.464 --> 14:44.383
-No.
-What kind of a girl is she?

14:44.884 --> 14:47.469
Kind of innocent
because her dad's overprotective.

14:47.928 --> 14:50.264
I think maybe she's self-conscious
because her family doesn't have

14:50.347 --> 14:51.724
as much money as the other students.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.810
As much money as Charles Slocum's family,
for example?

14:55.060 --> 14:56.103
I guess.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.480
-Have you spoken with Carla today?
-No.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.817
-When did you see her last?
-At school... two days ago.

15:02.067 --> 15:05.529
She say anything about going away
or trouble at home?

15:05.738 --> 15:08.198
No... no.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.493
-Is something on your mind, Madison?
-You think Carla is okay, right?

15:11.952 --> 15:14.371
-At this point we don't know anything.
-Why do you ask?

15:14.455 --> 15:17.499
I mean, if you thought that something
was really wrong, you'd say so, right?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.877
The only way we can do that
is if we have all the information.

15:20.044 --> 15:22.087
Yeah, if you know anything,
you should tell us.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.424
About two weeks ago,
Carla told me she was pregnant.

15:26.592 --> 15:29.970
-Is Charles the father?
-Yeah. She's pretty freaked out.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.765
-She afraid to tell her father?
-Yeah, and Charles.

15:33.140 --> 15:36.435
-BALDWIN: Why is she afraid of Charles?
-Because she isn't gonna have an abortion.

15:36.644 --> 15:37.811
She thought that might scare him away.

15:38.520 --> 15:41.482
I told her Charles is a good guy,
and that she should tell him.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.901
I guess she did,
because the next time I asked,

15:44.068 --> 15:46.362
she said... they were working it out.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.280
And that's the last time
you talked to her?

15:49.531 --> 15:51.158
No, I got a call from her two nights ago.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.662
She said she was gonna see Charles.
And everything was fine.

15:55.579 --> 15:57.831
She told me she loved me,
which was kind of weird.

15:58.165 --> 16:00.960
Did she say where she was going
or what they were going to do?

16:01.418 --> 16:06.632
No. You swear you won't tell anyone this
unless you absolutely have to?

-It doesn't feel like it.

Calvin was at work all day.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.767
You think he's telling the truth
about not knowing where the dad is?

We believe him and the dad
are on the outs.

dropped off his mother.

Still, Lopez has at least
50 gangbangers under him.

-He easily could have pushed a button.
-I like the super, and the fact

16:28.529 --> 16:30.781
that we can't put our hands on him
only reinforces it.

-What the hell is he telling him that for?

18:01.955 --> 18:03.457
This is about a gang shooting.

a couple of names,

are probably looking for him.

-So...
-(DOOR CLOSES)

22:11.371 --> 22:14.291
-Carla wanted to go first.
-Yeah.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.626
She put the gun to her head,
and she pulled the trigger.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.171
-Yeah.
-Then what happened?

22:20.088 --> 22:23.508
I picked up the gun,
but I saw her lying there with...

22:24.801 --> 22:28.430
blood pouring out of her head,
and I just ran away.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.515
So you didn't fire the gun after she did?

22:31.475 --> 22:35.854
No. I put it on the floor
and just... ran off.

22:36.605 --> 22:38.315
You got a big problem, Charles.

22:39.941 --> 22:41.151
We just talked to crime scene,

22:41.318 --> 22:43.445
and they found two shell casings
and two slugs

22:43.570 --> 22:46.281
-and they both came from that MAC-10
-That's not possible!

22:46.615 --> 22:48.784
Carla shooting herself twice
isn't possible, yeah,

22:49.034 --> 22:51.328
-which leaves one other scenario.
-No, it's a mistake.

22:51.453 --> 22:54.289
She was pregnant.
She wouldn't get an abortion.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.749
You argued with her. She wouldn't listen.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.667
-No, I didn't argue about...
-GREG: You killed her

22:57.876 --> 23:00.045
and then you staged this
"Romeo and Juliet" scene

23:00.128 --> 23:03.048
-with the flowers and the candles
-I wouldn't shoot her. I couldn't!

23:03.131 --> 23:06.510
We're talking first-degree murder now,
that's the death penalty.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.929
Tell the truth and maybe
you can save your life.

23:09.471 --> 23:13.100
Carla and I talked about this for days.
We discussed it, we planned.

23:13.725 --> 23:17.479
We wrote e-mails. Check my laptop...
and hers. You'll see.

23:17.604 --> 23:20.190
We still aren't hearing an explanation
for the two bullets.

23:20.524 --> 23:24.069
I don't have one. Maybe somebody else
came by afterwards,

23:24.152 --> 23:28.240
-and... fired the gun.
-GREG: Charles, that's pathetic.

23:28.573 --> 23:32.828
-Be a man and admit what you did.
-She pulled the trigger and collapsed.

23:33.829 --> 23:36.790
I picked the gun up,
then set it down and ran.

23:36.957 --> 23:39.126
That's what happened, I swear to God.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.920
-CONNIE: Thanks.
-What'd they say?

23:42.045 --> 23:43.255
She said she didn't know
Hatcher that well.

23:43.338 --> 23:44.423
But she worked with him?

23:44.506 --> 23:46.049
Yeah, and as far as that goes,
she said he was...

23:47.050 --> 23:49.344
-She used the word "Fine."
-See? See?

23:49.761 --> 23:52.180
-No, I don't, actually.
-Nobody wants to talk about this guy.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.266
Or he's just been flying under the radar.

23:54.349 --> 23:57.519
ANDY: No way. We've got a guy that worked
a few months here, a few months there.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.729
There's a reason
he's always getting the boot.

23:59.896 --> 24:02.774
Because a good detective... his boss
makes sure he stays put.

24:03.024 --> 24:05.318
-Where's Ortiz and Stan?
-Re-canvassing.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.279
He's sticking to his story.

24:07.529 --> 24:09.990
We're gonna get TARU to pull the e-mails
off their computers.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.492
-You said the girl used a MAC-10?
-Yeah, that's right.

24:12.868 --> 24:15.454
Where do two private school kids
get ahold of a cannon like that?

24:15.704 --> 24:17.747
Where do they get coke
and limos and pounds of weed?

-IRVIN: 15th Squad...
-Uh. ATF Is trying to trace the gun.

24:23.003 --> 24:26.465

up Lonnie Parker for taking a red light.

-Place looks exactly like it was in '71.
-Yeah.

24:58.914 --> 25:03.668
I'll tell you, I went to this barber shop
I used to go to over on Third Avenue.

25:03.960 --> 25:07.130
The whole damn block
is designer shoes now.

25:07.464 --> 25:09.841
It's nice to know
some things haven't changed.

25:10.550 --> 25:15.222
-Had a hard time find you today, Lonnie.
-Yeah. Sometimes I just check out.

25:15.472 --> 25:17.474
-That's still legal, right?
-Well, that all depends

25:17.641 --> 25:19.309
on what you were doing
before you checked out.

25:20.018 --> 25:23.730
I did some chores,
got in my car around 8:00 a.m.,

25:23.855 --> 25:26.316
headed up to the Bronx
to pick up some PVC.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.235
This guy on Glenhill Road
gives me a price.

25:28.568 --> 25:30.070
You see anything
before you got in your car?

25:30.237 --> 25:32.447
-No.
-You know Tony DeKeys?

25:32.906 --> 25:34.616
Sure, he's a tenant.

25:35.492 --> 25:36.701
You got a problem with him?

25:37.118 --> 25:39.204
He's new, so not too much.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.706
I got no beef with him,
if that's what you mean.

25:41.831 --> 25:44.042
-Did you see him this morning?
-I don't believe I did.

25:44.292 --> 25:46.711
Lonnie, you got six years of parole
to get through, right?

25:47.003 --> 25:48.296
Now why are you asking about that?

25:48.463 --> 25:50.507
Because I don't buy
a word you're saying to us

25:50.882 --> 25:54.052
and until you start telling the truth,
I'm gonna spend my time thinking of how

25:54.302 --> 25:55.512
to violate your parole.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.472
It's up to you.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.809
See, we know you made a run
for your car this morning.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.144
Wanna tell us why?

26:05.146 --> 26:07.274
-I can't get involved.
-You already are.

26:07.482 --> 26:09.067
In my day, there was a beef,

26:09.150 --> 26:10.944
you handled it with fists,
or a knife, maybe.

26:11.736 --> 26:14.739
But young guys today,
they got no mercy.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.992
So, what was this beef you had
with DeKeys?

26:17.158 --> 26:18.243
I didn't have none.

26:18.702 --> 26:21.913
But, apparently, he had
a beef with someone else.

and we'll protect you, if we can.

mixed up with these kids.

right now as a material witness.

-You give me protection?
-If it's warranted, absolutely.

walk up to him.

-Yeah.

27:53.296 --> 27:55.006
The MAC-10 that you found
at the scene,

27:55.090 --> 27:56.800
it was modified for automatic fire.

27:56.966 --> 27:59.427
They're saying one trigger pull
could've fired two bullets.

27:59.719 --> 28:03.765
-So maybe she did shoot herself.
-Also, I, uh, I ran the gun through ATF.

28:03.932 --> 28:06.434
They said the gun was from a shipment
that was stolen out of Providence.

28:06.559 --> 28:08.311
They picked up the gun dealer
a few months back.

28:08.436 --> 28:10.522
-Is there a connection?
-Well, Slocum's brother, Peter Slocum,

28:10.605 --> 28:11.606
was arrested in Providence

28:11.773 --> 28:14.526
for dealing meth out of his dorm room
two years ago.

28:14.609 --> 28:16.945
So Providence PD is gonna take
the brother's photo,

see if he picks it out.

-We have a witness.

-Maybe you had some other beef with him.

Wilmer, we're not saying
you pulled the trigger.

28:52.355 --> 28:53.815

about suicide,

So if you were gonna commit suicide
the next day,

32:14.432 --> 32:15.934
why are you buying tickets
for a concert a month from now?

32:16.434 --> 32:17.852
I was gonna give them to a friend.

32:18.519 --> 32:22.690
This e-mail says hat the tickets
won't arrive until two days from now.

32:23.274 --> 32:26.569
So how were you planning on giving them
to your friend if you were dead?

32:27.862 --> 32:29.989
You know, maybe
I wasn't thinking so clearly.

32:30.281 --> 32:31.991
Or you were never gonna kill yourself.

32:32.992 --> 32:35.495
Carla told you she was pregnant
but wouldn't have an abortion,

32:35.703 --> 32:36.746
and you weren't up for that.

32:37.038 --> 32:38.790
So, you sold her this pact,
and she bought it.

32:39.290 --> 32:43.711
All I did was fail to commit suicide,
which is not a crime.

32:44.003 --> 32:47.340
To prove otherwise, you'd have
to know what was inside my head.

32:47.882 --> 32:49.300
This tells us.

32:49.759 --> 32:52.762
I was upset. I didn't know
what I was doing. Doesn't prove a thing.

32:52.929 --> 32:55.515
We can prove how you got that gun
from your brother on Providence.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.351
All I did was borrow it from him.

32:58.434 --> 33:00.853
BALDWIN: That's transporting a gun
across state lines to commit a crime.

33:01.396 --> 33:04.524
That's a federal offense.
Get you a mandatory minimum of ten years.

33:05.066 --> 33:07.652
And that's not including what you can get
for assisting a suicide.

33:09.570 --> 33:13.157
If you want any consideration,
this is your last chance.

33:14.033 --> 33:15.201
Okay, look.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.413
Honestly, I was 50/50 going into it.

33:18.788 --> 33:21.249
Half of you knew that you'd make it
to the concert next month.

33:21.457 --> 33:23.876
Yeah, but half of me really wanted
to end it all

33:24.002 --> 33:25.211
and get away from this whole mess.

33:25.753 --> 33:28.089
But you let your girlfriend
think you were a 100 percent behind it.

33:28.172 --> 33:29.340
My girlfriend?

33:29.716 --> 33:32.051
She got pregnant to go after
my family's money.

33:32.343 --> 33:34.303
-She told you this?
-No, but come on.

33:36.764 --> 33:39.475
You're gonna do every day
of those ten years, Charles.

33:39.767 --> 33:40.935
I'm gonna see to it.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.983
I haven't heard from my dad,
if that's why I'm here.

wealthy, right?

33:58.953 --> 33:59.954
What the hell are you talking about?

34:00.246 --> 34:02.957
You lied to us, Calvin.
We checked your cell phone.

34:03.082 --> 34:04.959
We know you've been talking
to your dad today.

34:05.626 --> 34:07.920
Okay, maybe I did.
But what's the crime?

34:08.046 --> 34:10.965
Obstruction of justice,
accessory after the fact,

34:11.132 --> 34:12.467
a couple of other fancy legal terms

34:12.592 --> 34:14.927
that you'll be able to contemplate
during your five years in jail.

34:15.053 --> 34:18.097
-Five years? I didn't do anything.
-Then what were the phone calls about?

34:18.347 --> 34:21.184
Okay. First time, he called.

34:21.309 --> 34:24.187
He said that he was in trouble.
I said to turn himself in.

34:24.312 --> 34:26.022
He said that he would die in prison
if he did.

34:26.439 --> 34:28.149
After you talked to us,
what'd you tell your dad?

34:29.692 --> 34:31.986
Five years, Calvin. No joke.

34:32.278 --> 34:34.280
Did you tell him play up
the witness angle?

34:36.616 --> 34:37.784
CALVIN: Yeah.

34:38.076 --> 34:41.496
And that other detective said that
it might be Latin Kings involved,

34:41.913 --> 34:43.915
so I told my dad
he might wanna use that, too.

34:45.625 --> 34:49.128
-You involved in this, Calvin?
-No! No!

34:49.295 --> 34:52.840
I'd never kill someone.
I'm not like my dad.

34:53.132 --> 34:54.425
Then why've you been lying?

34:55.259 --> 34:58.262
He's a screw-up. And I hate him for it.

34:58.429 --> 35:02.558
But he's my dad. I can't just
turn my back on him.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.354
-Get in.
-I'm under arrest?

35:06.479 --> 35:08.606

to your dad. Let's go.

35:23.996 --> 35:26.332
Lied to us. All day,
trying to cover your ass.

35:26.499 --> 35:28.751
Admitted that he gave you
the Latin King alibi.

35:28.918 --> 35:30.128
Which is enough to put him away.

You haven't burned him enough
in your lifetime,

35:38.136 --> 35:39.428
now you're gonna put him in jail.

35:39.804 --> 35:42.557
Or is he more involved than he's saying,
'cause right now he's taking the ride.

you can't let slide.

And people can talk all they want,
cut in line, hog the phone.

with families walking in.

36:23.222 --> 36:26.017
I talked to him about all that,
but I kept it civil.

36:27.351 --> 36:31.230
This morning, taking out the garbage,
I forgot to lock my door.

36:32.190 --> 36:35.526
I get back, and someone's pissed
on my bed.

36:36.235 --> 36:39.947
I walk out in the hall
and Tony is smiling at me.

36:40.990 --> 36:44.702
-I can't let that slide.
-Where did you get the gun?

36:44.827 --> 36:46.787
I kept one for protection.

36:47.455 --> 36:50.249
So I grab it, went looking for Tony.

36:50.833 --> 36:51.959
He's in his car.

36:53.377 --> 36:54.754
Make sure he saw me.

36:55.338 --> 36:58.633
And then I shot that son of a bitch
till I knew he was dead.

37:01.010 --> 37:04.764
-You're letting my boy go, right?
-Yeah.

37:08.142 --> 37:09.435
No way.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.438
She had an SAT prep course she was taking.

37:12.939 --> 37:14.941
She was going to music camp this summer,

37:15.274 --> 37:18.653
to see the ballet next month,
which she was really looking forward to.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.405
There is no way that she killed herself.

37:21.614 --> 37:24.450
We're very sorry, but it looks like
that's the case.

my little girl up there,

37:27.036 --> 37:29.538
and put a bullet in her himself
and make it look like suicide?

your daughter was preparing for this.

37:33.084 --> 37:36.379

He set this whole thing up.

37:36.504 --> 37:39.757
-And he's gonna face charges.
-For a gun violation?

37:40.216 --> 37:42.426
This guy should be going away for murder.

37:43.803 --> 37:46.138
There's what we think happened
and what we can prove.

37:46.639 --> 37:48.391
And unfortunately, all we can prove

37:48.474 --> 37:51.602
is the gun violation
and assisting a suicide.

37:51.936 --> 37:54.146

to keep her safe.

for a guy like this?

-She didn't.

she's overly sensitive or...

-No.
-Good. That's what I figured.

a little too enthusiastic in the room.
