<i>my favorite holiday,</i>

<i>And not just because</i>

00:09.143 --> 00:11.543
<i>My killer decorating skills.</i>

00:12.679 --> 00:15.147

<i>When</i> you<i> decorate</i>

00:16.784 --> 00:20.152
<i>Hmm.</i>
<i>You must not be doing it right.</i>

00:24.791 --> 00:27.026
<i>But what I love most</i>
<i>about Halloween</i>

00:27.028 --> 00:29.762
<i>Is a johnson family tradition</i>

be very careful

So sweet.

Hey, junior, there's a girl
named sophie calling you.

00:58.626 --> 00:59.625
Junior: Sophie?

00:59.627 --> 01:02.094
Sophie's calling me?

What is...

<i>I'm telling you.</i>

01:28.622 --> 01:31.657
<i>This long-standing tradition</i>

Oh, look at that --

in my night-guard case.

01:47.675 --> 01:49.141
[ chuckles ]
aww.

01:49.143 --> 01:50.476
The twins must have tried
to prank me.

stupid twins.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.147
Oh, my god.

Huh?

01:56.150 --> 01:57.616
It's you.
What?

You're the stupid twins.

Come on, bow.

Make an effort.

Oh, that was my warm up.
Oh?

02:04.425 --> 02:05.791
You just need to prepare

02:05.793 --> 02:08.560
To be dethroned this year,
prank king.

What?
Oh. Oh, you --

You really think
you're gonna get me?
Yeah.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.599
Huh. Your poker face
gives away more

02:13.601 --> 02:15.734
Than an episode of
"oprah's favorite things."

02:15.736 --> 02:17.569
[ laughs ]
I knew it!

02:17.571 --> 02:19.872
Secret oprah fan.
Yes!

Yes, I am.
I miss her every day.

Don't you love her?

Here's a tip
from the prank king.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.411
Okay.
Fake spiders...

Yes?
...Bush league.

02:27.448 --> 02:28.614
Oh, come on.
You want to prank?

02:28.616 --> 02:29.882
Use real spiders.
What?

02:29.884 --> 02:30.916
Like that one.
What?

Oh, hey, babe, babe,
babe, babe, babe.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.588
I was joking, all right?

02:36.590 --> 02:37.756
It's fake.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.759
But the superglue
on that magazine?

02:40.761 --> 02:41.760
Totally real.

02:41.762 --> 02:42.895
What?

02:42.897 --> 02:44.596
Dre, that is not funny.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.932
Dre, I have surgery
in the morning.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.867
Well,
I'm about to go to bed.

Hmm?

02:56.410 --> 02:57.442
What was that?

02:57.444 --> 02:58.777
I didn't hear anything.

02:58.779 --> 02:59.912
You're so paranoid.

02:59.914 --> 03:01.780
You always think
you hear something, dre.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.715
No, no, babe.
I definitely heard something.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.517
Hmm?
This could be it --

03:05.519 --> 03:06.818
The home invasion.
What?

03:06.820 --> 03:08.353
Okay, babe, babe, babe, babe.
You go and check.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.488
No! What?
Go check.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.590
Okay, you're right.
You're right.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.392
I'll go check.
I'll go check.
Okay.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.804
You got to shop.
Dre.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.940
What?
Why do you have a camera
in the refrigerator?

03:27.942 --> 03:30.609
To determine if I'm gonna go
downstairs or not.

03:30.611 --> 03:33.745
You are the laziest man
I ever met.

03:33.747 --> 03:34.746
What?

03:34.748 --> 03:35.847
Are there any grapes
in there?

03:35.849 --> 03:37.616
Uh, no.
Oh.

03:37.618 --> 03:38.951
[ door creaks ]
[ both scream ]
what?

03:38.953 --> 03:40.552
Oh.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.321
Both: Hey, babies.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.590
Diane had a nightmare
and told me about it,

03:44.592 --> 03:46.558
And now I'm more scared
than she is.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.427
Can we sleep in your room
tonight?

03:48.429 --> 03:49.494
Yeah, come on.
Come on, come on.

03:49.496 --> 03:50.929
Get in here.
Just get up.

Get in here.

This is nice.
Mm-hmm.

What the...

04:01.842 --> 04:02.841
We wet the bed.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.276
You guys got pranked!

Boo-yah!
[ laughs ]

04:05.879 --> 04:07.579
Unh-unh.

These are

04:09.783 --> 04:10.983
Family meeting!
Now!

04:10.985 --> 04:12.017
Let's go.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.252
What does that mean?

04:13.254 --> 04:14.519
[ claps ]
hey!

04:14.521 --> 04:16.255
All right, now,
as you all know,

04:16.257 --> 04:17.789
Pranking each other
on Halloween

04:17.791 --> 04:21.560
Is a long and glorious
johnson family tradition.

04:21.562 --> 04:24.696
So why do we need to hear about
it in the middle of the night?

04:24.698 --> 04:27.432
Because the youngest members
of our team are confused

04:27.434 --> 04:29.835
As to what constitutes
a prank.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.470
We peed on daddy.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.805
[ laughs ]
rainbow:
Again, not a prank.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.807
Hey, now, I'm gonna need
you guys to look to zoey
as your role model

04:35.809 --> 04:39.411
'cause she is
an evil genius.

04:39.413 --> 04:42.414
I mean,
sophie really calling you?

04:42.416 --> 04:45.817
[ chuckling ] why would she even
have your number, huh?

04:45.819 --> 04:47.819
Hey, but I --
shut up!

04:47.821 --> 04:49.955
Baby girl,
I'm really excited

04:49.957 --> 04:51.790
About what you have planned
this year, all right?

04:51.792 --> 04:53.025
Now, if you can somehow
arrange it

04:53.027 --> 04:55.294
So he ends up
publicly naked --

04:55.296 --> 04:56.928
Whoo!
That's a prank.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.765
But not really sure
I'm gonna prank this year.

04:59.767 --> 05:01.833
Not really
feeling it anymore.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.903
What do you mean, you're not
gonna prank this year?

05:04.905 --> 05:07.906
Baby, you're the only one
that inherited my pranking gene.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.641
Hey!
Hey.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.842
Why don't you want to do it
anymore, baby?

05:10.844 --> 05:13.712
I don't know.
It's just kind of lame.

05:13.714 --> 05:14.846
I feel like
I've outgrown it.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.715
Oh. Okay.

05:16.717 --> 05:17.716
[ laughs ]

05:17.718 --> 05:19.384
Hilarious!

05:19.386 --> 05:21.453
[ laughs ]

05:21.455 --> 05:22.788
What, you're serious?

05:22.790 --> 05:24.923
Babe, you don't outgrow
pranking.

05:24.925 --> 05:29.361
I am, sweetheart.
She's a teenager now.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

05:29.363 --> 05:31.630
These things
are bound to happen.
Oh, not to me.

05:31.632 --> 05:34.032
Yeah, dad. I'm 15.

05:34.834 --> 05:35.834
I'm out.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.102
[ gasps ]

05:37.104 --> 05:38.537
Ohh.

05:39.972 --> 05:41.840
Family meeting adjourned!

05:41.842 --> 05:43.075
Kids...

05:43.077 --> 05:44.810
Don't look at me.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.945
It's okay, sweetie.
Don't look at your father.
No!

05:46.947 --> 05:48.880
But she decided to bail
on the family tradition

05:48.882 --> 05:50.982
That we've worked years
at building, man.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.085
This is the kind of stuff
that tears families apart.

05:53.087 --> 05:55.954
The family that pranks together
stays together.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.956
Wait, dre.
I think it's "prays."

05:57.958 --> 06:00.025
Uh, kris,
I think you work for me.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.893
[ shouts ]
[ screams ]

06:01.895 --> 06:02.894
Oh, god!

06:02.896 --> 06:04.496
It stings so bad!

06:04.498 --> 06:05.997
[ laughs ]
boo-to-the-ya!

06:05.999 --> 06:08.433
You just got josh'd!

06:08.435 --> 06:10.001
<i>Josh -- not my favorite guy,</i>

06:10.003 --> 06:13.505
<i>Mostly because he's always</i>
<i>asking me if I know jay-z.</i>

06:13.507 --> 06:15.006
<i>But this -- solid prank.</i>

06:15.008 --> 06:17.542
This is
scalding hot coffee.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.144
[ laughs ]
burned twice.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.546
Why is everyone standing around,
not working?

06:21.548 --> 06:25.016
Made his pour scalding
hot coffee all over his body.

06:26.018 --> 06:27.552
Outstanding.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.388
[ chuckles ]
hey, good one, josh.

06:29.390 --> 06:30.822
Oh, thanks,
dr. Driggity dre.

06:30.824 --> 06:33.158
That means a lot,
especially coming from you.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.760
Why is that?

06:34.762 --> 06:37.796
Well, I know bros
aren't exactly into pranks.

06:37.798 --> 06:40.432
Bros tend to be a little touchy
about being startled.

06:40.434 --> 06:41.867
I think they're startled
at the comfort level

06:41.869 --> 06:43.068
In which
you use the word "bro."

06:43.070 --> 06:46.104
But, hey, I love pranks,
all right?

06:46.106 --> 06:47.873
Everybody enjoys
a good prank.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.175
Boom.
I am so not okay.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.810
Oh, maybe you should get to
the hospital.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.445
We'll roll calls
when you get back.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.147
Ow!
All right, buddy?
[ chuckles ]

06:55.149 --> 06:57.182
[ groans ]

06:57.184 --> 06:58.850
Hey, babe.
Hmm?

06:58.852 --> 07:01.820
Big news. I found a way
to save Halloween.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.155
Ooh, that's great.

07:03.157 --> 07:04.823
I found a way
to save a guy

07:04.825 --> 07:07.626
That was at the bottom of a pool
for 20 minutes.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.828
But -- but you go.
Okay.
Here's what I realized.

07:09.830 --> 07:12.764
There's something about watching
another person's humiliation

07:12.766 --> 07:14.800
That makes you feel good
about yourself.

07:14.802 --> 07:17.836
And the entire company
went out of a long lunch --

07:17.838 --> 07:18.837
Not kris.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.772
Underwater
for 20 minutes.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.474
Mm-hmm.
Heart completely stopped.

07:22.476 --> 07:23.642
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

07:23.644 --> 07:28.113
What does zoey love more
than anything in the world?

07:28.115 --> 07:30.515
Watching bad stuff happen
to junior.

07:30.517 --> 07:33.018
Wh--
so all I have to do is prank him
in front of her,

07:33.020 --> 07:34.820
And she'll remember
how magical pranking is

07:34.822 --> 07:38.056
And then the prank king
is back on top!

07:38.058 --> 07:39.558
[ laughs ]

07:39.560 --> 07:40.792
[ claps ]

07:40.794 --> 07:43.895
He drove himself home
from the hospital.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.798
Very little brain damage,
so...

07:46.800 --> 07:47.999
Good job, bow!

07:48.001 --> 07:52.904
<i>I enlisted jack and diane as</i>
<i>my accomplices to prank junior,</i>

07:52.906 --> 07:55.507
<i>Hoping to show them</i>
<i>a non-urine-based stunt.</i>

07:55.509 --> 07:57.642
