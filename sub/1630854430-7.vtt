WEBVTT

00:11.045 --> 00:12.946
He's gone.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.284
You just destroyed my life.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.286
Dwight is totally outta control.

00:18.419 --> 00:19.787
Enough already.
Take him out.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.056
Him and his fucking daughter.

00:22.190 --> 00:23.524
His fucking daughter?

00:23.657 --> 00:25.126
If you were
half the man he was,

00:25.259 --> 00:27.195
this would've never happened.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.463
All right, I'll go park,
I'll be up in a minute.

00:31.899 --> 00:34.034
A lot of people are
gonna get hurt, Goodie.

00:34.168 --> 00:37.371
- So, how do we cool this down?
- Get on
the next flight out here.

00:37.505 --> 00:38.906
What happened
with this Italian guy?

00:39.039 --> 00:41.075
Territorial shit.
They tried to muscle in,

00:41.209 --> 00:43.377
- Macadams fought back.
- We should alert the FBI.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.079
Talk to your boyfriend,
Carson Pike,

00:45.213 --> 00:47.981
and get Waltrip
to back the fuck off.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.883
Your boy Dwight,
he interested in sitting down

00:50.017 --> 00:51.919
with Waltrip
if I could arrange it?

00:52.052 --> 00:55.055
If you, sir, had come to me
like a gentleman,

00:55.189 --> 00:56.590
asked my permission.

00:56.724 --> 01:00.561
No. This land belongs
to you... and me.

01:00.694 --> 01:03.364
No one said
I was a diplomat.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.802
He's done.

01:14.041 --> 01:16.910
What do you think?
That good enough?

01:17.445 --> 01:18.879
Work of art.

01:23.784 --> 01:25.586
All right.
Let's get 'er in there.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.288
Better get his jacket first.

01:36.029 --> 01:37.565
So, was this a one-off?

01:38.432 --> 01:39.333
Or one of many?

01:39.467 --> 01:41.068
Too soon to tell.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.639
Ready? <i>Ciao.</i>

01:48.209 --> 01:49.643
<i>Bloodwork looks terrific.</i>

01:49.777 --> 01:51.011
<i>How's the pain?
Getting better?</i>

01:51.179 --> 01:54.482
It still hurts
to swallow a little bit.

01:54.615 --> 01:57.585
<i>Well, that'll get
better as time passes.</i>

01:57.718 --> 01:59.920
<i>No more cigars,
though, right?</i>

02:00.188 --> 02:01.989
<i>And no screaming.
Try to rest your voice.</i>

02:02.190 --> 02:04.425
<i>These are the kind of calls
I like to make.</i>

02:04.558 --> 02:06.594
<i>Nothing but good news.</i>

02:07.195 --> 02:09.697
<i>You take care of yourself,
Mr. Invernizzi.</i>

02:09.830 --> 02:11.299
<i>You do that,
then no reason</i>

02:11.432 --> 02:13.734
<i>why you shouldn't live
another 15 years.</i>

02:13.867 --> 02:15.203
You hear that, Pop?

02:16.404 --> 02:17.738
That's great.

02:20.208 --> 02:21.775
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Where have you been?

02:21.909 --> 02:23.311
I've been calling for hours.

02:23.444 --> 02:25.579
- What's the matter?
- Emory was mugged.

02:25.713 --> 02:27.215
- What? When?
- Last night.

02:27.315 --> 02:28.616
<i>They beat the shit out of him.</i>

02:28.749 --> 02:30.318
<i>We're in the hospital.</i>

02:30.451 --> 02:31.685
You know, the last two years

02:31.819 --> 02:33.387
the whole goddamn city's
going to hell.

02:33.521 --> 02:35.889
- Is that Joanna?
Is she with you?
- Yeah.

02:36.023 --> 02:37.558
All right, that's good,
that's good.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.228
Now, I want you to tell me
exactly what happened.

02:40.228 --> 02:42.596
He dropped me and the boys off
in front of the building.

02:42.730 --> 02:44.232
And then he went
to go park his car.

02:44.232 --> 02:45.799
Way back,
some guy attacked him.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.768
Okay, was it one guy,
or more than one?

02:47.901 --> 02:49.036
Oh, he doesn't know.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.138
<i>Walking down the street's
the last thing</i>

02:51.272 --> 02:53.006
<i>- he remembered.</i>
- Did they take his...

02:54.141 --> 02:55.543
did they take his wallet?

02:55.676 --> 02:57.745
- Did they rob him?
- No.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.079
What'd the doctor say?

02:59.247 --> 03:01.782
A concussion,
fractured ulnar,

03:01.915 --> 03:04.285
bruised ribs,
a few abrasions.

03:04.418 --> 03:05.553
Listen...

03:06.153 --> 03:08.622
I want you and Emory

03:08.756 --> 03:11.959
and the kids
to come to Oklahoma.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.894
Wait, to Oklahoma?

03:14.027 --> 03:16.930
- Because of this?
- Just as a precaution, Tina.

03:17.064 --> 03:20.368
- Is there something
you're not telling me?
- No, no, of course not.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.936
Then no.
Our life's here.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.874
Look,
I don't like this, Tina.

03:27.007 --> 03:29.009
<i>- It could be a warning.</i>
- Yeah, well,

03:29.142 --> 03:30.844
I'm not really
having a ball myself,

03:30.978 --> 03:32.980
but unless you give me
specific information

03:33.113 --> 03:34.782
that you want to share,

03:34.915 --> 03:36.083
I'm just going to
chalk this down

03:36.284 --> 03:37.885
to some horrible coincidence.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.887
I don't like coincidences.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.156
I'll call you
if there's anything else.

03:43.291 --> 03:45.158
All right. Yeah. Just--

03:46.026 --> 03:47.628
Just call anytime.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.863
<i>Can you just
keep your phone on, please?</i>

03:51.965 --> 03:53.301
Hey.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.469
Should I wrap
something up in it?

03:56.304 --> 03:59.840
Like a dead fish?
Pike?

04:01.208 --> 04:02.510
Northern? Flounder?

04:03.143 --> 04:06.046
No, the--
the jacket's enough.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.689
<i>The next train
to arrive on platform two</i>

05:21.822 --> 05:23.624
<i>would be the 18...</i>

05:23.757 --> 05:26.560
- Art Deco.
- Art-- Art who?

05:27.060 --> 05:28.295
Art Deco, this building.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.030
It's an architectural style.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.900
My wife, Clara,
she knows all about this shit.

05:33.033 --> 05:36.136
- She took design classes.
- Oh, that's-- that's cool.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.672
You think so?
Fucking waste of money.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.073
She works at Walmart now.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.647
- You Tyson?
- Goodie?

05:51.018 --> 05:54.788
- What the fuck
are you doing here?
- Relax. I live here.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.125
Y'all good?
Is everything--

05:58.258 --> 06:00.861
It's fine.
Old acquaintances.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.864
I work with Dwight now.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.733
Okay.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.069
- I got to pat you down.
- What?

06:10.037 --> 06:13.306
- I gotta search you.
- Nah, I don't think so.

06:13.441 --> 06:14.708
One of the reasons
I take the train

06:14.842 --> 06:16.444
is to avoid
shit like this.

06:16.844 --> 06:19.312
- You got a gun?
- What do you think?

06:19.880 --> 06:21.449
I'm going to sit
behind you in the car,

06:21.582 --> 06:23.617
so don't do anything stupid.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.626
How long is the ride?

06:32.760 --> 06:35.028
It's about an hour and a half,
give or take.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.363
Can I smoke?

06:36.930 --> 06:38.766
Yeah, for sure,
just roll your window down.

06:45.706 --> 06:48.476
- That's a nice ring.
- Thanks.

06:48.576 --> 06:51.244
- What'd that set you back?
- Like a thousand bucks.

06:51.378 --> 06:53.747
Hmm.
That's a pretty penny.

06:57.518 --> 07:00.187
So, seriously, what the fuck
are you doing out here?

07:00.320 --> 07:02.856
I was serious before.
I live here.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.358
Since '98,
when I left New York.

07:05.493 --> 07:06.760
When you ran like mascara?

07:06.894 --> 07:08.929
Yeah, what'd you get
for staying, huh?

07:09.062 --> 07:10.363
What'd I get?

07:11.098 --> 07:12.232
I got my button.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.234
And that makes me
the fucking augur

07:14.367 --> 07:16.670
of the living
and the dead.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.945
<i>You've reached Pike.
Leave me a message.</i>

07:28.816 --> 07:29.883
Voicemail.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.124
The fuck is he?

07:41.962 --> 07:43.130
Where's Pike?

07:43.731 --> 07:45.032
He never came home.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.571
This was outside.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.342
Open it.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.560
The fuck?

08:15.829 --> 08:17.364
- Oh...
- Pike's cut.

08:17.565 --> 08:18.966
- Fucking bullet holes.
- Oh, no!

08:19.099 --> 08:21.702
- Oh, Jesus, no!
- Get her out of here.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.572
- No, please, no!
- Get her out!

08:24.705 --> 08:26.874
No! No, please, no!

08:33.013 --> 08:34.447
Holy shit.

08:36.049 --> 08:39.352
I mean, can they just,
like, do this?

08:40.120 --> 08:43.023
I don't know if they can,
but they did.

08:44.257 --> 08:45.959
You guys clean up out here.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.161
I got to go
clean up my office.

09:36.977 --> 09:39.046
Hey, what's up?

09:39.179 --> 09:42.683
He's dead.
They fucking killed him.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.218
Hold on a second.
Excuse me.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.456
What are you talking about?
Who's dead?

09:49.657 --> 09:51.992
<i>They murdered him,
he never came home.</i>

09:52.125 --> 09:55.428
Who? Roxy, I can't unders--
Roxy. Who?

09:55.562 --> 09:57.665
Carson.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.232
He went out last night

09:59.366 --> 10:02.202
<i>to send a message
or something.</i>

10:02.335 --> 10:04.571
Shoot out a few windows.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.974
Fuck. Where did he go?

10:07.107 --> 10:10.911
Some cowboy bar
where the mob guy hangs out.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.780
<i>And this morning,</i>

10:12.913 --> 10:14.381
his jacket...

10:15.348 --> 10:19.319
<i>covered in blood and full
of fuckin' bullet holes.</i>

10:19.853 --> 10:21.689
<i>They killed him.</i>

10:22.622 --> 10:25.358
All right, Roxy, I need you
to listen to me, okay?

10:25.492 --> 10:27.661
It is very important
that you stay calm right now.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.229
I'm going
to text you an address,

10:29.362 --> 10:31.398
and I want you
to meet me there at 4:30.

10:31.531 --> 10:33.667
<i>- Okay?</i>
- Yeah.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.736
And in the meantime,
stay away from Waltrip

10:35.869 --> 10:37.204
and all those guys.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.672
Understand?

10:40.841 --> 10:42.275
Okay.

10:43.343 --> 10:44.812
I will see you there.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.556
There he is. The General.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.559
You tell
that wig-wearing motherfucker,

10:59.693 --> 11:01.161
he comes
around my daughter again,

11:01.294 --> 11:03.731
I will chop
his fucking head off.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.734
Whoa, what happened?
What are you talking about?

11:06.734 --> 11:08.736
My daughter's husband,
last night.

11:09.469 --> 11:10.938
Someone beat
the shit out of him.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.740
I don't know
anything about that.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.375
- You think it's him?
- Chickie? Why?

11:15.508 --> 11:17.544
- Why would he do that?
- Or that punk, Vince?

11:17.745 --> 11:20.781
Pete would fucking kill them.
They know it, too.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.449
He stood up for you,
by the way,

11:22.582 --> 11:23.650
after that thing with Nico.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.185
- Who did?
- Pete.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.990
What about
that thing with Nico?

11:30.123 --> 11:32.392
Dwight,
the guy was a piece of shit.

11:33.093 --> 11:35.428
- Did you know?
- About him and Tina?

11:35.562 --> 11:37.030
Of course not.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.232
Come on, you've known me
since I'm a baby.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.302
On my mother's eyes, Dwight.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.304
I would have
clipped him myself.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.374
Nobody knew,
I'm telling you.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.814
All right,
let's get something to drink.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.216
I gotta say,
I was a little surprised

11:56.349 --> 11:57.885
- at who picked me up.
- The kid?

11:58.018 --> 11:59.152
- Armand.
- Oh, no.

11:59.286 --> 12:00.954
Listen, Armand, he's okay.

12:01.088 --> 12:02.355
He's out here
by coincidence.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.424
Don't read anything
into that at all.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.594
- Fair enough.
- Drink for you?

12:07.795 --> 12:10.030
Vodka, rocks, lime.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.266
So, this your joint?

12:13.400 --> 12:15.435
Well, me and my partner here.

12:15.568 --> 12:16.870
Not bad.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.606
Not bad at all.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.408
I'll tell you,
let me help.

12:21.541 --> 12:24.377
I'll turn this place into the
second coming of the Flamingo.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.914
You believe
the balls on this guy?

12:27.047 --> 12:28.348
He's not here five minutes

12:28.481 --> 12:30.250
and already has designs
on our place.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.352
I'm sorry.
Am I overstepping?

12:32.485 --> 12:34.154
You overstepped when you
come over the threshold,

12:34.287 --> 12:35.956
- you punk.
- Didn't you invite me here?

12:36.089 --> 12:37.624
I'm breaking your balls.

12:37.825 --> 12:40.861
To some things never changing.

13:10.657 --> 13:11.724
You're okay.

13:13.526 --> 13:14.294
You're okay.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.629
Come on, you're okay.

13:16.763 --> 13:18.731
You're okay,
come on.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.203
You're gonna be okay,
all right?

13:24.537 --> 13:26.106
I need you to pull
yourself together for me.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.507
Can you do that?

13:27.640 --> 13:30.978
Do you think there's any hope?

13:31.778 --> 13:33.346
- Hope for what?
- Carson.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.049
That he's not dead and maybe
they have him somewhere,

13:36.183 --> 13:37.885
like, they're holding him or,

13:37.885 --> 13:39.386
like, some kind of
bargaining chip.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.221
I don't think that's likely.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.158
But maybe.
You know, who knows?

13:45.993 --> 13:47.260
Stranger things
have happened.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.262
Let's keep
a good thought, okay?

13:49.796 --> 13:51.331
And in the meantime,

13:51.464 --> 13:54.067
we still have
work to do, okay?

13:54.767 --> 13:56.136
What?

13:56.269 --> 13:58.205
Roxy, whatever happened
to Carson, I can--

13:58.338 --> 13:59.973
Okay,
I can lay this squarely

14:00.107 --> 14:01.741
at Caolan Waltrip's feet,
all right?

14:01.909 --> 14:04.277
- I just need you to help me.
- I can't go back there.

14:04.411 --> 14:06.213
I know,
I know it's hard.

14:07.114 --> 14:08.481
But you gotta do it
one more time.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.717
- Okay? Just get me something.
- Like what?

14:10.918 --> 14:12.485
Anything. Anything at all.

14:12.619 --> 14:14.287
Record a conversation,
take pictures.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.423
Just something incriminating.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.398
He has a laptop.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.735
Waltrip. I saw it.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.237
And what's on it?

14:30.370 --> 14:32.739
I don't know, he was
looking at some numbers.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.275
Banking stuff or something.

14:35.408 --> 14:36.944
- Can you get it for me?
- I don't know.

14:36.944 --> 14:40.480
Well, I need you to try,
okay? You have to try.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.582
I want to be done
with this shit.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.751
We have an agreement, Roxy,
to keep you out of jail

14:44.952 --> 14:47.654
and you gotta keep up
your end of the bargain.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.390
How did my life
get so fucked up?

14:50.523 --> 14:53.793
Hey, this is
the last time, okay?

14:55.428 --> 14:57.530
Don't do it for me.
Do it for yourself.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.433
For Carson.

15:01.401 --> 15:03.470
He deserves to have
that fucker put away.

15:05.838 --> 15:08.241
All right, I'll see you
tomorrow morning at the diner.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.543
10:00 a.m.
Do not be late, okay?

15:39.739 --> 15:41.441
- Yeah?
- Pete, it's me.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.310
It's him. Hang on.

15:44.011 --> 15:45.645
Hey, it's me.
You're on speaker.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.048
<i>The doctor wants him
to rest his vocal cords.</i>

15:48.181 --> 15:50.550
- Okay.
- How's it going?

15:51.351 --> 15:54.154
- How's Tulsa?
- Listen, did you fuck up
Dwight's son in law?

15:54.287 --> 15:57.390
- What?
<i>- Tina's husband,
someone tuned him up.</i>

15:57.524 --> 15:59.026
I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.428
<i>All right, forget it.</i>

16:02.062 --> 16:03.830
So, what do you got?
You got any intel?

16:04.031 --> 16:06.466
Well, this,
you're not going to believe.

16:07.434 --> 16:10.070
- Fucking Armand is out here.
- What?

16:10.203 --> 16:12.439
Picked me up at the station
with some Black kid.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.041
He works for Dwight now.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.476
Well, how the fuck
did that happen?

16:16.609 --> 16:18.045
He says
he lived out here

16:18.145 --> 16:19.712
and he ran into Dwight
when he showed up.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.514
That sounds like bullshit.

16:22.215 --> 16:23.516
He's making money, Dwight?

16:23.650 --> 16:25.885
Yeah, he's doing okay.
He's got a bar.

16:26.053 --> 16:28.221
His partner's
in a pot dispensary.

16:28.355 --> 16:29.689
He's got a crew?

16:30.257 --> 16:31.758
- Besides Armand?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

16:31.891 --> 16:33.426
He gets his weed
from the Indians,

16:33.560 --> 16:34.761
some cowboy runs the bar,

16:34.894 --> 16:36.329
and the Black kid
drives him around.

16:36.463 --> 16:37.864
It's like
the fucking Village People.

16:38.065 --> 16:39.866
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, yeah.

16:40.067 --> 16:41.968
And get this, Pete.
The <i>titsoon?</i>

16:42.102 --> 16:43.803
He's wearing the ring
you gave Dwight.

16:43.936 --> 16:46.106
- What?
- The pinky ring
Dwight used to wear?

16:46.239 --> 16:48.475
- The Black kid's wearing it.
- What, he gave it to him?

16:48.608 --> 16:50.910
Unless somehow
he got the identical ring.

16:51.078 --> 16:54.081
- But Dwight ain't wearing it.
- He wasn't wearing it
in New York.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.782
Pop, Pop, your voice.

16:55.915 --> 16:58.185
Enough with my fucking voice.

16:58.318 --> 17:01.554
- Just trying to help--
- Will you shut the fuck up?

17:03.590 --> 17:05.092
Fine. Talk. Whatever.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.595
What's his mood?

17:09.462 --> 17:11.364
Honestly, Pete,
I can't call it.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.300
He's still hot
about the Nico situation

17:13.433 --> 17:14.701
and now he's riled up

17:14.834 --> 17:16.103
with the son-in-law
getting attacked.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.870
Well, we had nothing
to do with that.

17:18.004 --> 17:19.706
I'm just saying.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.474
He's his own man out here.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.243
<i>That much is obvious.</i>

17:23.376 --> 17:26.213
<i>He's not going to be
controllable for much longer.</i>

17:42.629 --> 17:44.131
- Who is it?
<i>- Stacy.</i>

17:46.233 --> 17:47.434
Did you kill Carson Pike?

17:47.567 --> 17:48.868
Come in.
Don't be shy.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.837
- I asked you a question.
- Are you drunk?

17:50.970 --> 17:52.905
Answer the fucking question.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.809
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to?

17:57.710 --> 17:59.579
His girlfriend was
an informant for the ATF.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.881
- My informant.
- So?

18:02.014 --> 18:04.284
I could arrest you right now,
you know that?

18:05.818 --> 18:07.787
Well,
what are you waiting for?

18:08.955 --> 18:10.890
You think
the judge is gonna care

18:11.023 --> 18:12.659
that Pike was
a piece of shit?

18:13.360 --> 18:14.727
This is Oklahoma, pal.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.563
They'll fry your ass.

18:17.164 --> 18:20.567
Exactly
what do you want from me?

18:20.700 --> 18:22.202
I don't know.
I don't fucking know.

18:22.335 --> 18:23.903
Look, I know you're upset
and everything, but--

18:24.036 --> 18:25.372
You completely
fucked my life.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.807
- You realize that?
- I'm sorry. I didn't--

18:29.542 --> 18:31.378
I don't believe
that's true.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.662
Hello?

18:52.799 --> 18:53.800
Hello?

18:58.205 --> 18:59.972
Okay, who the fuck is this?

19:00.106 --> 19:02.675
Hello?

19:05.512 --> 19:07.347
Hel--

20:59.225 --> 21:01.027
You checking
your email, love?

21:03.330 --> 21:05.598
- You okay?
- Yeah.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.734
Christ, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to frighten you.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.969
No, it's fine, I just--

21:30.056 --> 21:31.391
Is there...

21:33.526 --> 21:36.062
something
you want to tell me?

21:44.070 --> 21:45.905
Hey, come on.

21:46.038 --> 21:48.375
Come on,
can't be that bad.

21:50.743 --> 21:53.179
Come on.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.247
I was arrested...

21:57.384 --> 21:59.051
about six months ago.

21:59.185 --> 22:01.087
All right.
I see, I see.

22:01.220 --> 22:03.456
I'm sorry,
I was so afraid.

22:08.728 --> 22:11.398
Yeah. You know,
you look...

22:12.264 --> 22:14.100
quite fetching
in this light.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.937
You must have noticed that...

22:18.705 --> 22:23.410
I've had my eye on you
for some time now.

22:25.745 --> 22:26.879
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

22:27.747 --> 22:30.417
You need a man,
love, to...

22:32.552 --> 22:34.421
look out for you
and protect you.

22:36.155 --> 22:38.024
No one knew that
better than Pike,

22:38.157 --> 22:40.427
but, you know, alas.

22:52.104 --> 22:54.974
- I could be your old lady.
- Yeah?

22:55.107 --> 22:57.143
Take care of you,
anything you want.

22:57.276 --> 22:58.911
I'd fancy that.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.280
Really would.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.458
What are you doing?

23:13.059 --> 23:14.326
Are you gonna cut me?

23:15.261 --> 23:18.030
Am I going to cut--
cut you? No, no.

23:20.132 --> 23:22.201
God, no. Heaven forbid.

23:24.537 --> 23:26.238
It's all right,
it's-- hush.

23:30.477 --> 23:33.345
There you go, okay.

23:45.492 --> 23:47.594
First, we use
the curry comb, right?

23:47.727 --> 23:51.764
To loosen the dirt,
dead skin, whatever.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.900
After that, it's this.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.401
The body brush.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.570
Short circular strokes,
you see?

23:57.704 --> 23:59.238
Yeah,
you like that, Pilot?

23:59.371 --> 24:00.740
He does.

24:02.308 --> 24:04.276
Here. Why don't you try?

24:06.345 --> 24:07.614
I'll give it a shot.

24:11.183 --> 24:14.521
- Somebody's up early.
- Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.389
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

24:18.658 --> 24:20.627
Do you mind
giving us a second?

24:20.760 --> 24:22.829
- I'm gonna go get coffee.
- Okay.

24:25.064 --> 24:28.100
No better therapy
than taking care of an animal.

24:28.234 --> 24:29.936
You saying I need therapy?

24:30.069 --> 24:32.171
Well, if I'm wrong,
you'd be the first person

24:32.304 --> 24:33.573
I ever met who didn't.

24:33.706 --> 24:35.207
How long
have you had this place?

24:35.341 --> 24:38.010
Uh, on my own?
Eight years.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.746
It was my husband's--
my ex-husband's

24:39.879 --> 24:41.948
- before that.
- Ahh.

24:42.081 --> 24:45.317
You know, you really
ought to ride this boy.

24:45.451 --> 24:46.886
He really wants you to.

24:50.957 --> 24:55.695
So, I was wondering
if maybe...

24:57.564 --> 24:58.565
I could buy you
dinner tonight?

24:58.698 --> 25:01.568
- Buy me dinner?
- Yeah.

25:01.668 --> 25:03.469
Actually,
that's occasionally

25:03.603 --> 25:05.672
how we do it here
in the 21st century.

25:05.805 --> 25:08.274
All right, then.
Let's do it.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.410
I gotta clear
my social calendar, but...

25:12.211 --> 25:13.445
it can be done.

25:14.681 --> 25:17.116
I will get your number
from Army--

25:17.249 --> 25:19.118
- or Armand and...
- Mm-hmm.

25:20.352 --> 25:21.621
we'll make a plan.

25:22.589 --> 25:24.156
Looking forward to it.

25:24.290 --> 25:25.825
Me, too.

25:46.846 --> 25:49.616
<i>-
Good morning.</i>
- Hi. Is Roxy there?

25:49.749 --> 25:52.051
I'm afraid
she's not right now.

25:53.219 --> 25:56.689
- Can I leave a message?
- I suppose you could.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.192
But myself,
I don't see the point, really.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.629
Who is this?

26:02.762 --> 26:04.631
<i>You dialed
the number for hell.</i>

26:04.631 --> 26:07.934
Darling, who did you think
would answer?

26:26.986 --> 26:28.788
- Morning, everybody.
- Mornin', boss.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.489
- How you doing, Fred?
- I'm good, sir.

26:30.657 --> 26:32.158
Tired.
I started the night classes.

26:32.291 --> 26:33.359
I'm proud of you.

26:34.026 --> 26:35.995
- Bodhi around?
- He's in his office.

26:37.496 --> 26:39.165
You look very nice today, Grace.

26:39.298 --> 26:41.267
- You think?
- Definitely.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.102
Yeah. Certainly do.

26:44.804 --> 26:47.473
Ah, I see you, uh,
you got rid of the dreads.

26:47.674 --> 26:50.109
Good man.
My people will thank you.

26:55.915 --> 26:58.184
- There he is.
- Oh.

26:59.485 --> 27:00.519
Hi.

27:00.687 --> 27:02.989
- How you doing?
- Good.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.924
Though I did notice that

27:05.057 --> 27:07.026
the mountain of cash
that was in my safe

27:07.159 --> 27:09.696
never found its way
into those duffel bags.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.597
Yeah, I was going
to tell you about that.

27:11.731 --> 27:13.833
I got an idea
for a new investment.

27:14.533 --> 27:16.102
What are you looking at me
like that for?

27:16.235 --> 27:18.270
You don't even know
what I'm gonna say.

27:18.404 --> 27:19.739
You're right.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.608
This could be any number
of harebrained schemes.

27:22.742 --> 27:23.910
Go on.

27:24.043 --> 27:26.212
Where do you get
the fucking balls?

27:26.345 --> 27:29.381
Seriously, I put guys
in traction for saying less.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.583
But I'm the golden goose, Dwight.

27:32.118 --> 27:33.385
You're not gonna hurt me.

27:34.286 --> 27:36.756
Yeah, well, the golden goose
got whacked, pal.

27:36.889 --> 27:39.458
Just saying.
Want to hear my idea?

27:40.126 --> 27:42.361
- Yeah.
- Okay. Read the book.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.797
We partner up.
You and me and Mitch.

27:44.931 --> 27:47.867
We do renovations,
get some girls,

27:48.000 --> 27:49.401
a little live music.

27:50.036 --> 27:51.170
Put a casino in the back.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.072
- A casino?
- Yeah.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.207
- How's that going to work?
- Jimmy the Creek.

27:55.341 --> 27:56.943
Put his name on the license
and run it

27:57.076 --> 27:59.311
through the National
Indian Gaming Commission.

27:59.445 --> 28:01.914
- How much does that cost?
- The license? Nothing.

28:02.048 --> 28:03.916
Maybe a half a million bucks
to grease the wheels.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.752
Half a million dollars?

28:06.485 --> 28:08.587
Listen, it may take
a little while to get it,

28:08.755 --> 28:10.222
but it's gonna be
fucking worth it.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.892
Think about it.
When you own a casino,

28:13.025 --> 28:15.427
you got a license
to print money.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.097
A license
to launder it, too.

28:18.998 --> 28:20.266
There you go.

28:23.970 --> 28:25.237
Dwight...

28:26.773 --> 28:28.775
are you familiar with NFTs?

28:28.908 --> 28:31.778
- Crypto?
- Yeah, I don't like it.

28:32.111 --> 28:34.013
- Why not?
- Because you can't see 'em.

28:34.146 --> 28:35.681
You can't touch 'em,
you can't feel 'em,

28:35.815 --> 28:37.083
you can't put
ketchup on 'em.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.617
To me, they're not real.

28:38.785 --> 28:40.686
They are very real,

28:41.453 --> 28:43.790
even though you can't pour
ketchup on them.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.892
- Do you buy Bitcoin?
- No.

28:48.094 --> 28:51.697
I steal from other people
who buy Bitcoin.

28:58.570 --> 28:59.872
Holy shit.

29:00.372 --> 29:01.440
Is that real?

29:02.441 --> 29:05.377
Did you really think you were
the only criminal in Tulsa?

29:17.589 --> 29:19.892
I thought that was you.

29:20.626 --> 29:21.894
Hey, Father.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.998
- How you doing?
- Oh, fine.

29:26.132 --> 29:28.567
We got the feast coming up,
so, busy.

29:29.701 --> 29:30.970
How's your father?

29:31.737 --> 29:32.905
Cancer's gone.

29:33.739 --> 29:36.008
He's got the COPD.

29:37.209 --> 29:38.978
- Uses the tank.
- Ah.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.013
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

29:42.048 --> 29:43.582
Better than an ankle bracelet.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.119
Always a tether in life.

29:47.253 --> 29:50.689
You know, since my mom passed,
he's like this...

29:52.624 --> 29:53.860
he's like this boulder

29:54.626 --> 29:56.695
that I just can't get
out from under.

29:56.863 --> 29:59.899
The Lord doesn't give us more
than we can handle, Charles.

30:00.032 --> 30:01.467
I don't know
about that, Father.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.404
I didn't want this,
you know?

30:07.273 --> 30:09.008
I wanted to join the army,

30:09.942 --> 30:11.143
be a colonel, something.

30:11.277 --> 30:13.745
I know he took
your college fund,

30:13.880 --> 30:14.813
squandered it.

30:14.947 --> 30:16.382
He took more than that.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.318
Took my soul.

30:20.519 --> 30:21.587
My degrees.

30:22.454 --> 30:25.224
The safest road to hell
is the gradual one.

30:25.724 --> 30:27.426
The funny thing is...

30:29.161 --> 30:31.998
like, Adam and Eve,
he used an apple.

30:32.865 --> 30:37.469
I was a little kid,
we were on Eldritch Street,

30:38.337 --> 30:41.440
uh, where he grew up,
and, uh, there were these--

30:41.573 --> 30:43.242
these push carts,
these vendors,

30:43.375 --> 30:46.178
and we would go there
to make his collections

30:46.312 --> 30:49.148
and then he would buy me
an egg cream

30:50.182 --> 30:51.450
on Avenue Way.

30:53.085 --> 30:54.686
Anyway, there was this--

30:55.654 --> 30:59.725
this fruit cart
with all these apples.

31:02.328 --> 31:03.729
"Go ahead, take one.

31:04.931 --> 31:06.198
You're a little kid.

31:07.066 --> 31:07.934
They won't say nothing."

31:08.067 --> 31:09.635
- And did they?
- No.

31:10.836 --> 31:12.104
I wish they did.

31:14.840 --> 31:17.409
I told my mother
he made me steal the apple

31:17.543 --> 31:18.945
and she rode him for days.

31:19.078 --> 31:22.548
Amelia. I'm sure.

31:23.215 --> 31:24.650
He never forgave me.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.586
Or he never forgave himself.

31:28.620 --> 31:32.124
A man without conscience
can never forgive himself.

31:33.692 --> 31:36.028
Because he doesn't think
he did anything wrong.

31:49.141 --> 31:50.409
Thank you.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.646
You hungry?

31:54.780 --> 31:56.582
Yeah, they'll bring me
something later.

31:56.715 --> 31:58.550
Hospital food?
Come on, there's a Junior's.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.086
I'll go over
and grab you something.

32:00.219 --> 32:02.354
- Slice of cheesecake?
- I'm good.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.738
How do you feel
about moving?

32:19.871 --> 32:21.007
Tribeca?

32:21.807 --> 32:23.809
- We talked about that.
- No, not Tribeca.

32:24.743 --> 32:27.613
- Oklahoma.
- Have you lost your mind?

32:28.314 --> 32:29.448
Why? Is that so crazy?

32:29.915 --> 32:33.019
You own a business, Tina.
I work on Wall Street.

32:33.419 --> 32:35.254
Yeah,
there's banks in Tulsa.

32:35.387 --> 32:37.656
There are bank branches
in Tulsa,

32:37.789 --> 32:40.626
but not trading departments,
not arbitrage.

32:42.028 --> 32:43.729
It's not safe here anymore.

32:43.862 --> 32:45.031
Obviously.

32:45.664 --> 32:47.533
I'm an unfortunate statistic,

32:47.666 --> 32:50.236
but we move
near your gangster father?

32:50.369 --> 32:51.770
That's your solution?

32:52.671 --> 32:53.839
What?

32:54.040 --> 32:55.241
It's just,

32:55.374 --> 32:57.209
for the last seven years,

32:57.343 --> 32:58.510
all I ever heard about
in counseling

32:58.644 --> 33:00.046
is how he abandoned you,

33:00.146 --> 33:02.114
now suddenly
you want to uproot our family

33:02.248 --> 33:03.215
to be near him?

33:06.618 --> 33:07.886
You're right.

33:11.290 --> 33:13.825
We're gonna be okay.
I promise.

33:26.805 --> 33:29.308
Don't get any in my eyes.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.410
All right, just relax.

33:33.879 --> 33:37.883
You know, I never got to do this
for my own dad.

33:40.286 --> 33:42.421
He was a good man.

33:43.122 --> 33:44.856
He wanted me to be a cop.

33:46.292 --> 33:48.094
I broke his heart.

33:53.999 --> 33:55.767
Why didn't you want that
for me?

33:55.901 --> 33:58.704
- Want what?
- A regular life.

33:59.238 --> 34:03.842
Ah, you got it so bad.
Big beautiful house,

34:04.610 --> 34:08.314
indoor pool,
making a fucking fortune.

34:08.447 --> 34:09.848
Yeah, I know.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.120
You know...

34:15.521 --> 34:19.125
one day you're going to be
boss of this family.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.427
Practically are already.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.862
Sometimes
it doesn't feel that way.

34:24.430 --> 34:25.697
What do you mean?

34:26.632 --> 34:27.466
The way you talk to me.

34:29.135 --> 34:31.137
Like I'm some
stupid fucking kid.

34:31.137 --> 34:34.140
This bullshit,
all this complaining,

34:34.140 --> 34:37.309
I'm sick and tired of it,
I'm fed up with it.

34:37.443 --> 34:38.877
Bullshit.

34:39.010 --> 34:40.146
You think...

34:41.747 --> 34:43.649
Dwight's a better man
than I am?

34:43.782 --> 34:46.152
- What?
- Dwight.

34:47.619 --> 34:48.720
It's what you said.

34:48.854 --> 34:51.223
Enough of this
Dwight bullshit.

34:51.357 --> 34:52.791
<i>Stata zit!</i>

34:55.461 --> 34:56.995
I wanna get out.

36:01.227 --> 36:04.630
So... how long
were you married?

36:04.763 --> 36:06.432
Um, nine years.

36:07.366 --> 36:10.135
- Quite the learning experience.
- So, what did you learn?

36:10.269 --> 36:13.472
Well, besides the fact
that my ex, Brian,

36:13.605 --> 36:15.607
- is a lying sack of shit?
- Oh.

36:15.741 --> 36:16.908
Um...

36:17.576 --> 36:20.779
- Learned I never want to
get married again.
- That bad, huh?

36:20.912 --> 36:23.349
Even as an ex,
he's a nightmare.

36:24.650 --> 36:26.718
He has partial interest
in the ranch.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.720
Oh, so his last name's
Fennario.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.790
No, Gillen.

36:32.491 --> 36:35.827
Fennario, it comes from a song
called "Peggy O."

36:35.961 --> 36:37.162
I heard it.

36:37.296 --> 36:38.730
Grateful Dead did a version.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.332
- Judy Collins.
- Bob Dylan.

36:40.466 --> 36:42.701
I didn't know that one.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.069
Yeah, it's a--

36:44.270 --> 36:46.104
it's a mythical place
in Scotland.

36:46.272 --> 36:48.274
Very smart. Impressive.

36:56.014 --> 36:57.449
I think this is the part

36:57.583 --> 36:59.385
where you're supposed
to talk about yourself.

36:59.518 --> 37:01.753
I haven't done that
for a long time.

37:02.654 --> 37:03.922
Ex-wife.

37:05.090 --> 37:06.958
Daughter who, uh...

37:08.294 --> 37:10.095
I've started to talk to,
got in touch with her again.

37:10.296 --> 37:11.630
We were estranged
for a long time.

37:11.763 --> 37:14.666
- Oh, well, that's nice.
- I think it's great.

37:15.133 --> 37:16.402
She may not think so.

37:21.307 --> 37:22.841
So, what do you think
of the veal?

37:22.974 --> 37:25.677
What do I think of the veal?
It's good, it's very good.

37:25.811 --> 37:26.978
Yeah. For Oklahoma.

37:27.112 --> 37:29.114
No, no,
not just Oklahoma, it's--

37:30.882 --> 37:32.418
Since we're being honest...

37:35.321 --> 37:38.324
I was in prison
for a long, long time.

37:39.024 --> 37:42.060
So, everything
tastes good to me.

37:42.193 --> 37:44.229
Even this lemon
would taste good.

37:59.244 --> 38:01.413
Aren't you going to ask me
what I went away for?

38:02.614 --> 38:05.351
Uh, I figured for 20 bucks
I could Google it

38:05.484 --> 38:07.453
and save us both
the awkwardness.

38:07.586 --> 38:09.355
Well, let me
save you some time.

38:12.358 --> 38:14.192
I killed a guy.

38:17.363 --> 38:20.366
He was burning up
in a building, trapped.

38:23.935 --> 38:26.171
I think I did him
a favor, I think.

38:32.778 --> 38:35.681
Can I ask you
a personal question?

38:35.814 --> 38:37.483
Sure.

38:38.149 --> 38:41.219
What does it feel like
to kill someone?

38:41.387 --> 38:42.954
Are you being serious?

38:43.088 --> 38:47.192
Believe me, I've--
I've considered it.

38:47.393 --> 38:48.960
You're a very unusual person.

39:03.409 --> 39:04.576
More coffee, Jerry?

39:04.710 --> 39:06.945
I'm good, hon, thank you.

39:53.024 --> 39:54.192
How you holding up?

39:54.893 --> 39:58.163
Fucking doctor.
Told me he was gonna be fine.

39:58.296 --> 40:00.165
At least
he didn't suffer, huh?

40:02.801 --> 40:04.603
Anything I can do?

40:05.504 --> 40:07.238
Yeah, you can help me

40:07.372 --> 40:09.641
get this family
back on fucking track.

40:25.223 --> 40:26.792
