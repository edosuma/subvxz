00:16.460 --> 00:21.230
<b><i>I saw him back at the staircase...</i></b>

00:24.010 --> 00:25.870
<b><i>Did he do it?</i></b>

00:27.180 --> 00:30.780
<b>Sorry, but what's about to happen is</b>

00:30.780 --> 00:33.510
<b>just me blowing off some steam.</b>

02:01.970 --> 02:06.980
<b>Strong x Or x Weak</b>

02:16.880 --> 02:17.820
<b><i>He disappeared?</i></b>

02:49.050 --> 02:50.140
<b><i>Godspeed.</i></b>

02:52.250 --> 02:56.960
<b>The difference in initial action 
speed was so overwhelming</b>

02:56.960 --> 03:01.160
<b>that Youpi had no time to 
make a sound or transform.</b>

03:02.190 --> 03:06.880
<b>Killua's Godspeed placed an 
electrical burden upon his own body,</b>

03:06.880 --> 03:10.410
<b>making it possible for his body to 
perform at a level far beyond</b>

03:10.410 --> 03:12.260
<b>what should have been possible.</b>

03:16.200 --> 03:20.980
<b>Killua had divided this power 
into two different abilities:</b>

03:22.350 --> 03:26.040
<b>Speed of Lightning, which allowed 
him to control his body at will,</b>

03:23.950 --> 03:26.450
<b>Speed of Lightning</b>

03:26.040 --> 03:31.710
<b>and Whirlwind, which allowed his body 
to react automatically to his opponent.</b>

03:29.700 --> 03:32.460
<b>Whirlwind</b>

03:32.900 --> 03:38.480
<b>In a previous fight, he'd used the 
latter to stop his opponent's dart.</b>

03:39.560 --> 03:42.400
<b>A preprogrammed attack is triggered in response</b>

03:42.400 --> 03:45.690
<b>to vibrations in aura that 
indicate the opponent's hostility.</b>

03:46.210 --> 03:48.050
<b>The attack bypasses commands from his brain,</b>

03:48.050 --> 03:52.620
<b>unleashing attacks that transcend his 
own limits by relying on reflexes alone,</b>

03:52.620 --> 03:56.570
<b>allowing him to easily surpass 
his opponent's physical speed.</b>

03:57.610 --> 04:00.880
<b><i>What's going on here?</i></b>

04:01.590 --> 04:08.310
<b><i>All of these guys have less than 
ten percent of my raw power.</i></b>

04:08.780 --> 04:10.820
<b><i>This makes no sense...</i></b>

04:11.940 --> 04:14.190
<b><i>I can't do a thing against him.</i></b>

04:19.560 --> 04:21.490
<b><i>Whirlwind!</i></b>

04:24.920 --> 04:26.520
<b><i>Profound...</i></b>

04:28.080 --> 04:32.030
<b><i>This "aura" stuff is intense...</i></b>

04:36.000 --> 04:38.550
<b><i>This is getting interesting.</i></b>

04:39.570 --> 04:45.010
<b><i>Before my explosion, I never would 
have enjoyed fighting an uphill battle.</i></b>

04:45.740 --> 04:51.260
<b>Youpi's change in heart would lead him 
to make an unbelievable choice,</b>

04:51.260 --> 04:53.520
<b>but this would not happen until later.</b>

04:58.740 --> 05:00.090
<b><i>Crap!</i></b>

05:01.470 --> 05:03.530
<b><i>I used it all up!</i></b>

05:03.810 --> 05:04.780
<b>Hold it!</b>

05:05.380 --> 05:07.500
<b>You're not getting away!</b>

05:08.370 --> 05:11.330
<b>You're seeing this through with me...</b>

05:11.330 --> 05:13.370
<b>Until you die!</b>

05:17.620 --> 05:18.640
<b><i>He disappeared?</i></b>

05:19.270 --> 05:20.760
<b><i>Again.</i></b>

05:20.760 --> 05:25.050
<b><i>He vanished, as though he were 
never here to begin with.</i></b>

05:26.310 --> 05:27.560
<b><i>That's it...</i></b>

05:28.800 --> 05:32.410
<b><i>At least one of them must have the ability</i></b>

05:33.350 --> 05:36.550
<b><i>to make people appear and disappear at will.</i></b>

05:43.390 --> 05:44.320
<b>Huh?</b>

05:45.630 --> 05:48.280
<b>Please enter your passcode.</b>

05:49.360 --> 05:52.660
<b>Damn, I didn't get a code.</b>

05:59.430 --> 06:01.840
<b>Your passcode and name do not match.</b>

06:02.510 --> 06:04.930
<b>Please reenter your passcode.</b>

06:05.640 --> 06:09.840
<b>A second input error will result in your restraint.</b>

06:10.630 --> 06:14.720
<b><i>He came down here without a passcode?</i></b>

06:15.290 --> 06:19.490
<b>Okay... Guess I'll have to step out.</b>

06:20.590 --> 06:22.740
<b>The door has been locked.</b>

06:22.740 --> 06:25.230
<b>Please enter your passcode.</b>

06:26.850 --> 06:27.900
<b><i>This is my chance!</i></b>

06:28.530 --> 06:30.100
<b><i>I have two options.</i></b>

06:31.410 --> 06:34.510
<b><i>The elevator will fill with 
sleeping gas eventually.</i></b>

06:35.020 --> 06:37.240
<b><i>Once he's asleep, I have to decide.</i></b>

06:38.230 --> 06:42.130
<b><i>One, I leave Brovada in the elevator,</i></b>

06:42.500 --> 06:46.510
<b>Monitor Room</b>

06:42.780 --> 06:45.780
<b><i>and head for the surface through the cargo entrance.</i></b>

06:47.470 --> 06:51.750
<b><i>This way, when he wakes up, 
he'll still be stuck in the elevator.</i></b>

06:52.260 --> 06:55.730
<b><i>But there's a high risk that someone above 
will notice that the elevator isn't coming up.</i></b>

06:57.010 --> 07:00.900
<b><i>Two, I move Brovada somewhere 
else while he's asleep.</i></b>

07:02.420 --> 07:04.270
<b><i>There are plenty of trucks parked around.</i></b>

07:05.270 --> 07:09.280
<b><i>And the warehouse doors require a 
passcode to open from the inside.</i></b>

07:09.960 --> 07:12.910
<b><i>When he wakes up, Brovada won't 
be able to open them.</i></b>

07:13.880 --> 07:17.410
<b><i>And if I use the cargo entrance 
to return to the surface,</i></b>

07:18.310 --> 07:23.920
<b><i>the risk that I'll encounter enemies will 
be much lower than if I take the elevator.</i></b>

07:26.080 --> 07:28.800
<b><i>No! That won't work!</i></b>

07:29.790 --> 07:32.070
<b><i>I have to kill Brovada while he's asleep!</i></b>

07:32.070 --> 07:33.680
<b><i>That's the safest option!</i></b>

07:34.190 --> 07:39.930
<b><i>Then, I have to take control of Brovada's corpse, 
and use it to take out other Squadron Leaders.</i></b>

07:40.550 --> 07:41.930
<b><i>That's the least it'll take!</i></b>

07:45.120 --> 07:50.270
<b><i>I'll stick the barrel of my gun through 
the gap in his armor and open fire.</i></b>

07:53.020 --> 07:56.430
<b>Ikalgo had the ability to control dead bodies,</b>

07:56.430 --> 08:00.200
<b>but he had never killed anyone 
with his own hands before.</b>

08:01.080 --> 08:04.320
<b>Enter your passcode at once.</b>

08:04.850 --> 08:08.460
<b>If a passcode is not entered 
within thirty seconds,</b>

08:08.780 --> 08:10.810
<b>the restraining process will begin.</b>

08:14.340 --> 08:16.220
<b><i>The monitor room in the border guard area...</i></b>

08:17.070 --> 08:19.470
<b><i>There should be a monitor 
for the elevator camera,</i></b>

08:19.470 --> 08:21.450
<b><i>and a button to open the doors!</i></b>

08:48.860 --> 08:51.630
<b>Well, I'm outside now,</b>

08:51.630 --> 08:54.300
<b>but I had to destroy the elevator...</b>

08:54.810 --> 08:57.030
<b>Is there another exit?</b>

09:00.160 --> 09:01.420
<b><i>I was naïve...</i></b>

09:01.940 --> 09:03.580
<b><i>I didn't expect him to shoot the door.</i></b>

09:04.740 --> 09:05.680
<b><i>What now?</i></b>

09:06.080 --> 09:09.690
<b><i>Do I wait for him to lower his guard, 
then sneak out the cargo entrance?</i></b>

09:10.810 --> 09:13.810
<b><i>Or do I wait for him to leave?</i></b>

09:15.680 --> 09:19.330
<b><i>Either way, if he goes back to the surface...</i></b>

09:21.560 --> 09:23.390
<b><i>That's not good enough!</i></b>

09:24.640 --> 09:26.030
<b><i>I'm being naïve!</i></b>

09:27.000 --> 09:28.840
<b><i>If he returns to the surface,</i></b>

09:28.840 --> 09:32.000
<b><i>and tells the others that Flutter's dead,</i></b>

09:32.000 --> 09:33.820
<b><i>I'll be able to move around freely!</i></b>

09:36.340 --> 09:37.340
<b><i>Am I an idiot?</i></b>

09:38.470 --> 09:44.000
<b><i>If I allow an enemy to return to the surface, 
I'm putting everyone else in more danger.</i></b>

10:06.260 --> 10:08.160
<b>This one's tough.</b>

10:29.010 --> 10:31.270
<b><i>I can't let him go back up...</i></b>

10:31.780 --> 10:35.280
<b><i>If I can't stop him, I've failed my friends!</i></b>

10:53.500 --> 10:55.240
<b><i>Yes, this way!</i></b>

10:55.890 --> 10:58.300
<b><i>I'm gonna trap you.</i></b>

11:16.770 --> 11:17.990
<b><i>A little farther...</i></b>

11:19.520 --> 11:21.310
<b><i>Wait until he's a little farther from it...</i></b>

11:32.610 --> 11:33.330
<b><i>Now!</i></b>

11:46.420 --> 11:50.080
<b>So there was someone besides Flutter...</b>

11:50.080 --> 11:54.100
<b>Looks like you were trying to lure me in there...</b>

11:56.240 --> 11:58.110
<b>Too bad for you.</b>

11:58.470 --> 12:03.910
<b>If only one path remains, it's too good 
to be true. Anyone would be suspicious.</b>

12:04.480 --> 12:08.120
<b>Well, now I know about you.</b>

12:10.370 --> 12:15.880
<b>And I bet you're hiding in the 
monitor room to watch me, chicken!</b>

12:16.290 --> 12:17.520
<b><i>Damn...</i></b>

12:18.100 --> 12:21.250
<b><i>I could have completely 
trapped him in that hallway...</i></b>

12:22.450 --> 12:25.390
<b><i>But there's no way out from where he is now.</i></b>

12:26.120 --> 12:28.400
<b><i>He's still trapped.</i></b>

12:29.610 --> 12:32.250
<b><i>Sleeping gas will eventually 
fill the room, and he'll...</i></b>

12:33.900 --> 12:36.340
<b><i>Crap! He isn't trapped!</i></b>

12:36.340 --> 12:37.650
<b><i>There's a way out!</i></b>

12:38.930 --> 12:41.630
<b>I should get out of here...</b>

12:41.630 --> 12:44.110
<b>That's probably sleeping gas.</b>

12:45.520 --> 12:48.780
<b><i>I have to do something before he realizes.</i></b>

12:50.920 --> 12:51.900
<b><i>I know...</i></b>

12:52.300 --> 12:53.810
<b><i>The armored vehicles in the garage.</i></b>

12:54.370 --> 12:56.200
<b><i>With those, I could at least lock him in.</i></b>

12:56.570 --> 12:59.780
<b><i>But then I'll have no way to get 
back to the surface, either!</i></b>

13:00.910 --> 13:02.430
<b><i>Think...</i></b>

13:02.430 --> 13:04.680
<b><i>Is there anything I can use here?</i></b>

13:05.500 --> 13:08.180
<b><i>Come up with the best possible plan, fast!</i></b>

13:10.630 --> 13:14.610
<b>I guess I have to blow through this shutter...</b>

13:14.610 --> 13:16.440
<b>How annoying!</b>

13:21.010 --> 13:22.630
<b><i>I have to do this!</i></b>

13:30.540 --> 13:34.300
<b>Damn! All that firing, and I 
barely scorched the surface?</b>

13:34.860 --> 13:37.780
<b>Guess I'll need to think of something else...</b>

13:38.260 --> 13:39.280
<b>I know!</b>

13:40.440 --> 13:43.210
<b>You can operate the shutters 
from the monitor room,</b>

13:40.440 --> 13:43.210
<b>Monitor Room</b>

13:43.210 --> 13:45.810
<b>so I can go there to open the shutters.</b>

13:46.420 --> 13:48.330
<b>Nice idea!</b>

13:48.660 --> 13:49.470
<b>Wait,</b>

13:50.180 --> 13:53.440
<b>I have to go through the shutters 
to reach the monitor room.</b>

13:54.320 --> 14:00.250
<b>Damn, so I have to get through these 
shutters to return to the surface?</b>

14:01.120 --> 14:02.480
<b><i>Wait...</i></b>

14:03.660 --> 14:04.990
<b><i>There might be a way</i></b>

14:06.040 --> 14:08.810
<b><i>to escape without busting down the shutters.</i></b>

14:13.980 --> 14:15.800
<b><i>The shutter's opening?</i></b>

14:22.620 --> 14:24.310
<b>An armored vehicle?</b>

14:25.350 --> 14:28.010
<b>That's something a chicken would use.</b>

14:28.720 --> 14:31.150
<b><i>But the shutter behind it is still shut.</i></b>

14:32.050 --> 14:35.130
<b><i>The door to the monitor room is beyond that shutter.</i></b>

14:36.180 --> 14:37.910
<b><i>Which means that...</i></b>

14:37.910 --> 14:39.520
<b><i>First,</i></b>

14:39.900 --> 14:45.220
<b><i>he closed the front shutter and 
parked the vehicle there.</i></b>

14:45.220 --> 14:46.950
<b><i>Then he returned to the monitor room,</i></b>

14:46.950 --> 14:49.530
<b><i>and started raising the front shutter</i></b>

14:49.530 --> 14:55.290
<b><i>and lowering the back one, 
before racing back to the vehicle?</i></b>

14:56.040 --> 14:58.690
<b><i>Doesn't that mean he's also trapped?</i></b>

14:59.970 --> 15:04.270
<b><i>He closed off his only escape 
route, just to finish me off?</i></b>

15:05.690 --> 15:08.940
<b>Heh... Yeah, right.</b>

15:11.630 --> 15:14.700
<b>So there's more than one...</b>

15:14.700 --> 15:17.930
<b>The other's watching in the monitor room.</b>

15:17.930 --> 15:19.390
<b>Pisses me off!</b>

15:21.230 --> 15:24.060
<b>Watch this, you peeping tom...</b>

15:24.350 --> 15:27.820
<b>I'm gonna drag your buddy 
out of the armored vehicle</b>

15:27.820 --> 15:30.320
<b>and rip him to shreds!</b>

15:32.350 --> 15:34.040
<b><i>I'm the only one here.</i></b>

15:35.120 --> 15:37.670
<b><i>I have to do something...</i></b>

15:37.670 --> 15:39.080
<b><i>By myself!</i></b>

15:44.980 --> 15:46.340
<b>That's tough armor!</b>

16:02.520 --> 16:03.600
<b><i>I did it!</i></b>

16:07.150 --> 16:10.930
<b>Crap! He blocked the elevator!</b>

16:10.930 --> 16:16.100
<b>I could have blown a hole in the 
ceiling, and climbed up the wire!</b>

16:19.980 --> 16:21.590
<b><i>I've blocked his escape route.</i></b>

16:22.070 --> 16:23.570
<b><i>First hurdle cleared!</i></b>

16:31.260 --> 16:34.130
<b>You have guts to show yourself...</b>

16:34.130 --> 16:36.300
<b>I'm gonna riddle you with bullets!</b>

16:43.890 --> 16:45.150
<b>Smoke?</b>

16:52.790 --> 16:54.150
<b>Did he kill himself?</b>

16:54.150 --> 16:55.690
<b>Miss his chance to escape?</b>

16:55.690 --> 16:58.520
<b>Either way, there's no way to move this thing!</b>

16:59.150 --> 17:00.800
<b>There's only a few centimeters of space.</b>

17:00.800 --> 17:03.130
<b>The elevator's completely blocked!</b>

17:14.360 --> 17:17.680
<b>Hey! Your friend's gonna burn to death!</b>

17:18.100 --> 17:19.680
<b>If you act now, I'm willing to spare you!</b>

17:20.160 --> 17:21.950
<b>Open the damned shutter!</b>

17:21.950 --> 17:23.870
<b>You hear me?</b>

17:26.260 --> 17:29.600
<b><i>Being an octopus, I only need a few 
centimeters to squeeze through.</i></b>

17:30.650 --> 17:32.320
<b><i>Second hurdle cleared.</i></b>

17:33.930 --> 17:35.200
<b>Hey!</b>

17:35.200 --> 17:37.160
<b>Open the shutter!</b>

17:41.330 --> 17:45.610
<b><i>Now, I just have to wait for the 
sleeping gas to fill the room.</i></b>

17:54.270 --> 17:55.850
<b><i>I can hold my breath,</i></b>

17:55.850 --> 17:58.840
<b><i>but I don't want to waste time.</i></b>

17:58.840 --> 18:01.200
<b><i>Wait for the right timing!</i></b>

18:21.570 --> 18:23.830
<b><i>Third hurdle cleared.</i></b>

18:30.010 --> 18:31.300
<b><i>Be patient.</i></b>

18:32.760 --> 18:34.320
<b><i>Nice and slow.</i></b>

18:47.900 --> 18:50.390
<b><i>This is the final hurdle.</i></b>

18:51.940 --> 18:54.020
<b><i>I just have to pull the trigger, and I'm done.</i></b>

19:03.300 --> 19:05.870
<b><i>Fire! This is the best option!</i></b>

19:06.450 --> 19:09.870
<b><i>I'll be safest if I control his body 
and return to the surface!</i></b>

19:10.560 --> 19:12.880
<b><i>Which means I have to kill him...</i></b>

19:13.580 --> 19:15.880
<b><i>I'm the only one here.</i></b>

19:16.520 --> 19:20.380
<b><i>There's no one else to help me!</i></b>

19:20.950 --> 19:22.590
<b><i>I h-have to...</i></b>

19:24.190 --> 19:25.250
<b><i>kill him!</i></b>

19:55.860 --> 19:57.200
<b>I can't do it!</b>

19:58.180 --> 19:59.460
<b>I'm...</b>

20:01.470 --> 20:02.590
<b>I'm...</b>

20:03.260 --> 20:06.340
<b>just a coward!</b>

20:12.950 --> 20:17.480
<b>While Ikalgo was lamenting his weakness...</b>

20:18.110 --> 20:24.500
<b>Within the shifted central tower, 
as Morel faced off against Pouf's cocoon,</b>

20:24.500 --> 20:28.580
<b>he was battling doubts of his own, as well.</b>

20:29.330 --> 20:30.430
<b><i>Hold on.</i></b>

20:31.130 --> 20:32.080
<b><i>What if...</i></b>

20:32.660 --> 20:35.190
<b><i>Pitou! Pouf!</i></b>

20:35.770 --> 20:37.160
<b><i>Are you there?</i></b>

20:37.160 --> 20:38.300
<b><i>Hey!</i></b>

20:39.420 --> 20:44.330
<b><i>What if it isn't that he chose 
not to respond to Youpi,</i></b>

20:44.870 --> 20:47.360
<b><i>but that he wasn't able to respond?</i></b>

20:49.180 --> 20:51.770
<b><i>Within the cocoon should be
nothing but a goopy mess.</i></b>

20:51.770 --> 20:54.420
<b><i>He shouldn't be a completely formed creature yet.</i></b>

20:55.670 --> 21:01.430
<b><i>If he's utterly defenseless 
while he changes forms,</i></b>

21:01.430 --> 21:02.790
<b><i>this is the time to attack.</i></b>

21:05.410 --> 21:12.270
<b><i>Would he really make such a literally 
fatal mistake in this situation?</i></b>

21:13.980 --> 21:15.530
<b><i>It's not possible!</i></b>

21:15.530 --> 21:19.420
<b><i>This must be a trap. It's guaranteed to be a trap.</i></b>

21:20.760 --> 21:26.380
<b><i>But the question is whether the 
trap activates when I attack,</i></b>

21:27.100 --> 21:31.390
<b><i>or if it's already been activated, 
before I've even attacked.</i></b>

21:32.570 --> 21:33.750
<b><i>Which is it?</i></b>

21:36.330 --> 21:41.400
<b><i>You have doubts because you 
are good at what you do.</i></b>

21:42.670 --> 21:46.970
<b><i>However, that is all there is to it.</i></b>

21:51.830 --> 21:55.510
<b><i>Attack? Don't attack?</i></b>

21:57.180 --> 21:58.380
<b><i>What do I do?</i></b>

23:24.630 --> 23:26.840
<b>Next time: Fake x And x Real.</b>

23:26.840 --> 23:29.320
<b>Hey... If not now, when?</b>

23:30.270 --> 23:31.920
<b>Not yet!</b>

23:31.920 --> 23:34.060
<b>You're a fake. You aren't Killua.</b>
