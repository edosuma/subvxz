00:34.667 --> 00:36.735
Elsa:
Take it to the big tent.

00:43.343 --> 00:46.745
Elsa:
<i>Fate. Destiny. Luck.</i>

00:46.747 --> 00:49.048
<i>The prisons of man.</i>

00:49.050 --> 00:52.918
<i>People pass the time, enjoying</i>
<i>the choices life provides--</i>

00:52.920 --> 00:56.889
<i>Coffee or tea, right or left.</i>

00:56.891 --> 01:00.059
<i>(chuckles)</i>
<i>as if it matters.</i>

01:00.061 --> 01:03.562
<i>We are all just</i>
<i>spinning on the wheel.</i>

01:07.567 --> 01:10.769
<i>There is but one way</i>
<i>to keep off the wheel.</i>

01:10.771 --> 01:13.439
<i>It's not youth.</i>

01:13.441 --> 01:15.074
(gasps)

01:15.076 --> 01:17.810
<i>It's not beauty or true love.</i>

01:19.779 --> 01:23.415
<i>I know how to stay</i>
<i>off the wheel.</i>

01:23.417 --> 01:25.484
<i>I control my fate.</i>

01:26.619 --> 01:28.720
<i>I have survived because I know</i>

01:28.722 --> 01:32.391
<i>One must be willing</i>
<i>to destroy anyone, anything,</i>

01:32.393 --> 01:35.394
<i>Even the things you love,</i>
<i>to keep the gods in check.</i>

01:35.396 --> 01:38.030
What in the hell did you
bring that old thing out for?

01:40.233 --> 01:42.301
I was a master of the
wheel in my youth.

01:42.303 --> 01:44.536
We used to strap
a carny up here

01:44.538 --> 01:47.539
And william tell
an apple right off his head.

01:47.541 --> 01:48.807
Are we working this

01:48.809 --> 01:50.776
Back into the show?

01:50.778 --> 01:52.144
Oh, no, darling.

01:52.146 --> 01:53.045
Television.

01:53.047 --> 01:54.046
It's going to be

01:54.048 --> 01:57.616
My second act mainstay.

01:59.152 --> 02:02.154
Well, I hope you're not planning
on leaving too soon.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.922
With the twins gone

02:03.924 --> 02:05.090
And if you go, I mean,

02:05.092 --> 02:06.425
There's not gonna be
much show left.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.293
It was selfish of them to leave.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.129
Well, everybody's just
worried about them.

02:10.131 --> 02:12.498
Well, tell them to stop.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.933
I take that ungrateful
hydra dress shopping,

02:14.935 --> 02:16.735
And the second
I turn my back

02:16.737 --> 02:18.470
To buy a slip,

02:18.472 --> 02:20.739
They sneak
out the back.

02:20.741 --> 02:23.108
Truth is, the stage isn't
for everybody, you know.

02:23.110 --> 02:24.910
And tell our monsters

02:24.912 --> 02:27.079
That the only thing
they should be thinking about

02:27.081 --> 02:30.082
Is how grateful they are to me

02:30.084 --> 02:32.684
For saying yes
to this television show.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.686
In a couple of months,

02:34.688 --> 02:37.856
I will have you all, every one
of you, brought out to join me.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.091
Oh, they are grateful.

02:39.093 --> 02:40.526
I mean, it's your birthday week.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.027
They're out there

02:42.029 --> 02:43.595
Working on your presents.

02:43.597 --> 02:46.131
And I'm gonna make you the best
damn cake you ever had.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.466
Good.

02:47.468 --> 02:50.102
Now, go on, leave me.

02:50.104 --> 02:51.837
I need to practice.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.705
Okay, you're the boss, elsa.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.107
Yes, I am.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.718
I like dora better.

03:06.720 --> 03:10.622
Well, hindsight is 20/20, dear.

03:10.624 --> 03:13.258
Look under the dome;
I bought you a present.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.164
Prophylactics?

03:19.166 --> 03:20.732
What are these for?

03:20.734 --> 03:23.168
You're a young man with
a young man's needs.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.871
Inbreeding has caused
enough pain in this family.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.806
We don't need to muddy
the waters any further

03:27.808 --> 03:30.976
With whatever curse led
to those girls' affliction.

03:30.978 --> 03:33.979
I would never violate
those girls.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.714
I love them.

03:35.716 --> 03:40.152
I didn't think I could feel love
until I met them.

03:40.154 --> 03:43.088
My heart was lost.

03:43.090 --> 03:46.058
And it took a woman
with the vision of four eyes

03:46.060 --> 03:47.993
To find it,

03:47.995 --> 03:51.129
And the love of two hearts
to give it back to me.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.000
What do you think?

03:55.002 --> 03:57.069
Are you going to escort them
to cotillion?

03:57.071 --> 03:59.004
I will not allow you

03:59.006 --> 04:02.274
To isolate us from the world
because of some new fetish.

04:02.276 --> 04:03.408
Because they're freaks?!

04:05.278 --> 04:08.513
So am I, mother!

04:08.515 --> 04:11.583
When I'm with them,
I feel normal.

04:22.862 --> 04:24.863
(sniffles)

04:24.865 --> 04:29.167
There comes a time
in every mother's life...

04:31.871 --> 04:35.440
...When she must give up her son
to another woman.

04:39.479 --> 04:42.547
I'm going to marry
those girls, mother.

04:45.485 --> 04:47.085
We're going to be together

04:47.087 --> 04:49.521
Forever.

05:58.157 --> 06:00.125
(elsa gasps)

06:00.127 --> 06:02.127
<i>Oh, ethel.</i>

06:02.129 --> 06:04.730
Oh, you have outdone yourself.

06:04.732 --> 06:07.966
They say all the movie stars
use westmore.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.901
Yes.
You got to
have the best

06:09.903 --> 06:12.070
On your big trip
out to hollywood.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.538
Westmore.
(laughs)

06:13.540 --> 06:15.040
Well, come on,
step lively.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.142
Supposed to
be a party.

06:17.144 --> 06:19.911
Who's next?

06:19.913 --> 06:22.247
What have we here?

06:26.219 --> 06:28.186
(gasps)

06:28.188 --> 06:31.556
(laughs):
Ooh!

06:31.558 --> 06:34.059
Paul, you cheeky bastard.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.832
Eve.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.634
What can this be?

06:47.173 --> 06:48.840
(laughing)

06:48.842 --> 06:52.677
I will keep you warm, miss elsa.

06:55.214 --> 06:57.949
Oh,    <i>liebchen!</i>

06:57.951 --> 07:00.018
<i>Liebchen, liebchen, liebchen.</i>

07:00.020 --> 07:01.753
Oh.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.222
My very own hot water bottle
to cuddle with at night.

07:04.224 --> 07:06.191
Oh.

07:06.193 --> 07:08.126
(laughs)

07:08.128 --> 07:09.428
Oh...

07:10.630 --> 07:11.797
What's the matter?

07:11.799 --> 07:13.131
Why such long faces?

07:13.133 --> 07:15.100
This is just the beginning

07:15.102 --> 07:18.036
Of our glorious week
of festivities.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.404
Why so gloomy?

07:19.406 --> 07:21.940
We miss the twins.

07:21.942 --> 07:25.210
Did they say anything
before they took off

07:25.212 --> 07:26.878
About why they wanted
to leave?

07:26.880 --> 07:29.080
Paul: Maybe we should
go search for them.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.048
They might be lost or...

07:30.050 --> 07:31.249
Elsa:
No!

07:31.251 --> 07:33.452
Enough about the twins.

07:33.454 --> 07:35.821
I will have no more of this!

07:35.823 --> 07:37.289
We bring them in,

07:37.291 --> 07:39.958
Give them a
home, a family,

07:39.960 --> 07:43.295
And how do they repay us?

07:43.297 --> 07:46.231
By disappearing into the night.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.467
So, no more about the twins!

07:48.469 --> 07:50.669
Do you hear me?!

07:52.305 --> 07:55.807
Now, I demand that you start
having fun this instant.

07:55.809 --> 07:59.177
Or I'll put one of you
up against that wheel.

08:07.119 --> 08:09.187
¶

08:23.703 --> 08:25.971
Oh, no.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.706
No, no.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.542
Not you, too,
<i>mit</i> the long face.

08:30.544 --> 08:32.611
Who, me?

08:34.981 --> 08:38.783
Perhaps you are sad
that I'm leaving?

08:38.785 --> 08:41.987
Don't lie to
me, <i>liebchen.</i>

08:41.989 --> 08:44.055
Are you falling a
little in love?

08:44.057 --> 08:46.958
Hmm?

08:46.960 --> 08:49.127
Well, don't.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.897
We don't do
that, you and I.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.734
Does anyone
know about us?

08:55.736 --> 08:57.736
Of course not.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.905
They all assume when
I sneak into your tent at night

08:59.907 --> 09:01.973
That I'm putting a mint
on your pillow.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.808
(chuckles)

09:05.745 --> 09:08.146
(laughs)

09:08.148 --> 09:09.548
How sweet.

09:12.084 --> 09:15.086
You know...

09:15.088 --> 09:17.222
Perhaps you could
come out there with me.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.859
I mean, before
the others, huh?

09:20.861 --> 09:23.094
You do know how to please me.

09:23.096 --> 09:26.698
Are you able to drive?

09:26.700 --> 09:30.769
I imagine
I could learn.

09:30.771 --> 09:33.772
Of course...

09:33.774 --> 09:37.442
When I have a-a
normal suitor,

09:37.444 --> 09:39.878
You could simply pretend
you are my chauffeur.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.013
Which, of course,
you would be.

09:42.015 --> 09:46.251
I'm flattered that you would
even give me a passing thought.

09:46.253 --> 09:49.754
Go away now.

09:49.756 --> 09:53.024
Oh, but before
you do...

09:53.026 --> 09:56.094
Bring me my... My
cuddle, my darling.

10:15.081 --> 10:17.148
Sleep well,
miss elsa.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.453
(sighs)

10:21.455 --> 10:23.154
(chuckles)

10:24.991 --> 10:28.393
Oh, ma petite.

10:28.395 --> 10:31.062
(whispers): <i>Je t'aime</i>
<i>plus que les autres.</i>

10:31.064 --> 10:33.064
(laughs softly)

10:33.066 --> 10:35.467
(sighs)

10:35.469 --> 10:38.470
¶

10:38.472 --> 10:40.472
You've pricked yourself
climbing up the trellis,

10:40.474 --> 10:42.007
My poor thing.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.609
It's worth it to have
your hand on my face.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.815
Mm, you smell so good.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.150
Venetian romance.
(sniffs)

10:52.152 --> 10:54.119
My favorite perfume.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.687
Mm.
(chuckles softly)

10:56.656 --> 10:58.223
Mm.

10:59.291 --> 11:01.660
Don't you want me, paul?

11:01.662 --> 11:04.129
I want you more than you know.

11:04.131 --> 11:07.032
You're the softest,
sweetest thing.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.034
Like the roses
in my mum's garden.

11:09.036 --> 11:11.803
So why don't we make love?
You didn't have any trouble

11:11.805 --> 11:13.438
When there were
lots of people watching.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.173
It was different
that night.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.942
I'm in love with you now.

11:17.944 --> 11:20.979
You make me feel like
when I was young,

11:20.981 --> 11:23.448
Before life stole
my innocence.

11:23.450 --> 11:26.451
Before we make love, I want
you to know me-- as a man,

11:26.453 --> 11:28.153
Not just a lover.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.021
I've got so much more to offer.

11:31.323 --> 11:33.224
(pounding on door)

11:33.226 --> 11:35.326
Vince:
Who are you talking to?

11:35.328 --> 11:38.730
Why is this
damn door locked?

11:42.868 --> 11:45.570
Because I was sick of
living like a prisoner,

11:45.572 --> 11:47.539
You barging in here any time
you like, day or night.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.541
Heard you talking to someone.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.042
I was listening
to the radio.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.712
Don't play
the indignant card with me.

11:53.714 --> 11:57.415
You about put your mother to
the loony bin when you ran off.

11:57.417 --> 12:01.920
And now this last little stunt
where you disappeared again.

12:01.922 --> 12:05.523
Coming home, looking like
something the cat dragged in.

12:05.525 --> 12:08.326
That will not happen again while
you are living under my roof!

12:08.328 --> 12:09.728
Okay, I'm not deaf.

12:11.997 --> 12:14.432
Can I go to sleep now?

12:23.342 --> 12:25.410
I'm your pop.

12:28.347 --> 12:30.949
Just doing my job.

12:30.951 --> 12:34.018
Making sure
my little girl is safe.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.965
Bette: <i>Dear diary,</i>
<i>"happiness" is too small a word</i>

12:46.967 --> 12:48.867
<i>To describe how I feel.</i>

12:48.869 --> 12:51.035
<i>The shades of gray</i>
<i>that was my world</i>

12:51.037 --> 12:53.571
<i>Has turned incandescent</i>
<i>with color,</i>

12:53.573 --> 12:56.674
<i>So bright I can see them</i>
<i>with my eyes closed.</i>

12:58.811 --> 13:01.446
<i>The horizon appears</i>
<i>unlimited to me now,</i>

13:01.448 --> 13:03.748
<i>As if I was a bird in flight.</i>

13:03.750 --> 13:07.051
<i>Am I a fool, or has love</i>
<i>opened my heart?</i>

13:07.053 --> 13:08.419
Hello, ladies.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.054
Look what I have
for you.

13:10.056 --> 13:12.824
You must be famished.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.959
I didn't know
what you would wanted,

13:14.961 --> 13:17.428
So I had cook make

13:17.430 --> 13:20.098
One of... Everything.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.634
(gasps): Oh.
What's that?

13:22.636 --> 13:24.402
Dandy:
Caviar.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.004
Beluga from siberia.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.807
I've heard
of caviar.

13:28.809 --> 13:31.242
It's outrageously expensive.
Dot: <i>Bette.</i>

13:31.244 --> 13:32.744
<i>It's slimy fish eggs.</i>

13:32.746 --> 13:34.012
So?

13:34.014 --> 13:35.747
Nothing is too good
for my girls.

13:39.185 --> 13:41.152
Have a taste.

13:44.256 --> 13:46.825
Go ahead.

13:48.127 --> 13:50.195
Mmm.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.165
Heaven.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.166
(laughs)

13:55.168 --> 13:57.101
You can have it with every meal.

13:57.103 --> 14:00.305
Bette: <i>Dot warned me about men</i>
<i>and their sexual appetites,</i>

14:00.307 --> 14:02.273
<i>But her fears</i>
<i>have proven unfounded.</i>

14:02.275 --> 14:05.276
<i>Dandy is a gentleman</i>
<i>through and through.</i>

14:05.278 --> 14:06.377
(giggles)

14:09.481 --> 14:13.117
<i>I've never felt</i>
<i>this way before.</i>

14:13.119 --> 14:18.122
When he is near, my heart races
so rapidly I fear I will faint.

14:18.124 --> 14:19.958
<i>Could it be</i>
<i>that I've finally found</i>

14:19.960 --> 14:21.826
<i>The person</i>
<i>I can't live without?</i>

14:21.828 --> 14:23.127
(laughs)

14:23.129 --> 14:25.697
Dot:
<i>Dear diary,</i>

14:25.699 --> 14:27.999
<i>What manner of servitude</i>
<i>my sister and I</i>

14:28.001 --> 14:30.969
<i>Have found ourselves in</i>
<i>is not certain.</i>

14:30.971 --> 14:34.005
I trust you girls
have everything you need.

14:34.007 --> 14:35.807
I was hoping we could
go back and retrieve

14:35.809 --> 14:37.575
Some personal items
from our tent.

14:37.577 --> 14:40.912
Gloria: (laughs)
that won't be necessary.

14:40.914 --> 14:42.714
You've seen the last
of that horrid place.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.482
Make a list.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.484
We'll replace
everything you had

14:46.486 --> 14:47.986
With something brand-new.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.188
You can have
anything you want, dot.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.155
(chuckles)

14:51.157 --> 14:53.725
I'll make sure of it.

14:53.727 --> 14:56.527
Dot: <i>We haven't been beaten,</i>
<i>nor are we bound by chains.</i>

14:56.529 --> 15:00.164
<i>I have to wonder though</i>
<i>what dark intentions await.</i>

15:02.902 --> 15:06.170
Here's something in the news
that might be of interest.

15:06.172 --> 15:08.706
They performed the first
surgery separating

15:08.708 --> 15:11.209
Siamese twins.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.911
What does it say?

15:15.547 --> 15:17.882
"the 15-month-old
brodie twins

15:17.884 --> 15:20.785
"are in separate cots for the
first time in their lives.

15:20.787 --> 15:23.855
"a 12-hour,
40-minute operation

15:23.857 --> 15:26.057
"severed the tissue,
nerve cords

15:26.059 --> 15:28.092
And blood vessels
that joined them."

15:28.094 --> 15:30.261
Look.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.030
Aren't they cute?

15:32.032 --> 15:34.132
Dot: <i>And suddenly it was</i>
<i>clear why we were here.</i>

15:34.134 --> 15:35.466
They're adorable.

15:35.468 --> 15:36.968
Dot:
<i>The lifetime it would take</i>

15:36.970 --> 15:39.570
<i>For me to save the money</i>
<i>for the surgery?</i>

15:39.572 --> 15:42.307
Dandy had it at his fingertips.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.411
(doorbell jingles)

15:46.413 --> 15:48.112
Dot?

15:50.249 --> 15:51.783
(chuckles softly)

15:51.785 --> 15:54.085
It's dorothy.

15:54.087 --> 15:57.822
I go by my full name
now that half of me is gone.

15:57.824 --> 16:01.059
Yeah, I heard about the surgery.

16:03.162 --> 16:05.730
I am so sorry
for your loss.

16:10.936 --> 16:12.937
Dot:
<i>I'm not.</i>

16:12.939 --> 16:16.174
<i>Dale carnegie said, "if you</i>
<i>have a lemon, make a lemonade."</i>

16:16.176 --> 16:18.076
<i>With dandy's easy money,</i>

16:18.078 --> 16:21.145
<i>This gilded cage</i>
<i>may finally set me free.</i>

16:43.836 --> 16:44.936
Thank you.
Thank you.

16:44.938 --> 16:47.105
(doorbell jingles)

16:49.341 --> 16:51.109
Good day to you, sir.

16:51.111 --> 16:54.212
A bottle of lady's
perfume, if you please.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.114
Venetian romance,
it's called.

16:56.116 --> 16:57.882
We're out.
Really?

16:57.884 --> 17:00.485
Well, what's that there
on the shelf behind you?

17:00.487 --> 17:04.055
Oh. That venetian romance.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.523
$1.10.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.791
Dandy:
Clerk!

17:06.793 --> 17:07.859
Clerk!

17:09.061 --> 17:12.330
I could find only one
medium stiff-bristled faux

17:12.332 --> 17:13.698
Bone-handled lady's
hairbrush.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.066
I require two.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.135
Your selection
is woefully lacking.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.870
I could check around back.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.805
Do so at once.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.008
I know you.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.710
You and your mum.

17:25.712 --> 17:28.312
You tried to buy
out the house.
Oh.

17:28.314 --> 17:31.082
You're part of
that freak show.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.384
Well, can't say
we were very impressed

17:33.386 --> 17:35.019
With the quality
of the presentation.

17:35.021 --> 17:36.387
We will not be returning.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.023
Seemed to me you liked
it plenty at the time.

17:39.025 --> 17:41.559
You tried to buy the tattler
sisters, as I recall.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.861
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.663
Now please don't
speak to me any further.

17:59.044 --> 18:00.878
Is this freak
bothering you, sir?

18:00.880 --> 18:02.847
Yes, as a matter
of fact, he is.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.015
He tried to pick my pockets.

18:04.017 --> 18:06.350
(laughs)
that's a laugh.

18:06.352 --> 18:07.385
Get out.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.220
We don't sell to thieves.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.055
If I was a thief, I would have
taken it, wouldn't I?

18:11.057 --> 18:13.357
Get out or I'll call the cops.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.226
Go ahead. I've got my rights.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.394
You're not even american.

18:16.396 --> 18:17.795
I have the right
to refuse service.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.797
And I'm refusing to serve you.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.866
This place is overpriced anyway.

18:25.237 --> 18:28.206
I'm going to take my
business to woolworth's.

18:29.074 --> 18:31.142
They've got
ice cream.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.660
Good show tonight.

18:49.662 --> 18:52.797
Yeah. The gate was
a little lighter than usual.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.900
People were coming
to see those twins.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.269
Nothing we can
do about that now.

18:58.271 --> 19:00.638
It doesn't bother you-- the
way they just wandered off?

19:00.640 --> 19:04.108
I guess they were
never really happy here.

19:04.110 --> 19:06.110
I ran into that weirdo
at the drugstore.

19:06.112 --> 19:07.745
You know, that rich kid

19:07.747 --> 19:09.847
Who bought the house out
a few weeks ago?

19:09.849 --> 19:12.950
He was buying two
of all these girly things.

19:12.952 --> 19:14.819
Makeup, brushes.

19:14.821 --> 19:15.987
What are you saying?

19:15.989 --> 19:18.122
Well, think about it
for a second.

19:18.124 --> 19:19.991
Elsa hated them from
the minute they got here

19:19.993 --> 19:21.759
For taking her
spotlight away.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.362
They go, and she's
right back in it.

19:24.364 --> 19:25.963
That hollywood guy
wants her again.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.298
You shut your mouth!

19:27.300 --> 19:29.467
Elsa has
a dark heart, sure,

19:29.469 --> 19:31.335
But she saved every one of us,
including me,

19:31.337 --> 19:34.272
You, and bette and dot.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.373
You know your problem?

19:35.375 --> 19:36.941
You can pass.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.509
And when no one's
pretending,

19:38.511 --> 19:41.679
All the bullshit and the
noise just drops away.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.782
From your position, elsa looks
like our guardian angel.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.385
But from where I'm sitting,
I see a jealous broad

19:47.387 --> 19:50.354
Near the end of the line
who'd kill anyone or anything

19:50.356 --> 19:54.225
That got in the way of
her one last shot at it.

19:58.497 --> 20:01.132
Oh, thank you, dandy.

20:01.134 --> 20:03.801
This is the perfect shade.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.102
(chuckles)

20:06.138 --> 20:07.838
Dot:
"siamese twin,

20:07.840 --> 20:10.074
"separated, dies alone.

20:10.076 --> 20:14.011
"roger lee brodie, the larger
of the conjoined twins

20:14.013 --> 20:18.382
Separated by a surgery hailed as
a medical miracle, has died."

20:18.384 --> 20:20.218
But one survived.

20:22.087 --> 20:24.355
Rodney is still alive.
It's a blessing.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.324
Bette:
It's an abomination.

20:26.326 --> 20:30.194
Science should never
subvert the will of god.

20:30.196 --> 20:32.830
Is that what you think we are?

20:32.832 --> 20:35.566
God's will or god's cruel joke?

20:35.568 --> 20:37.969
What's gotten into you?

20:39.504 --> 20:41.372
We are what we are,

20:41.374 --> 20:44.809
And no amount of wishful
thinking is gonna change that.

20:45.777 --> 20:49.046
My arm, your leg.

20:49.048 --> 20:51.949
Where do you end
and I begin?

20:51.951 --> 20:54.919
Don't you realize by now
that we are always

20:54.921 --> 20:58.522
Going to share
everything?

20:58.524 --> 21:01.125
My thoughts are
my own, sister.

21:01.127 --> 21:03.194
You like secrets,
don't you, dot?

21:05.130 --> 21:06.564
I noticed your diary
is always locked.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.966
My diary is my sanctuary.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.969
My one
private place.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.939
And bette and I
have made a pact

21:14.941 --> 21:17.375
Never to read
what the other has written.

21:17.377 --> 21:20.144
We should have
no confidences between us.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.247
Let's make a deal.

21:23.249 --> 21:25.783
I'll tell you a secret
if you tell me one.

21:25.785 --> 21:28.119
(laughs)
I'll start.

21:29.087 --> 21:31.489
Remember the murders?

21:31.491 --> 21:33.124
The clown killer.

21:33.126 --> 21:35.459
The abducted children.

21:35.461 --> 21:38.429
I was there.

21:38.431 --> 21:40.064
I killed the clown.

21:40.066 --> 21:41.632
I saved those kids.

21:41.634 --> 21:42.933
No.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.568
The girl, too.

21:44.570 --> 21:46.070
No, jimmy would never
lie about that.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.072
You're the true hero.

21:48.074 --> 21:49.674
Lobster boy was unconscious.

21:49.676 --> 21:51.075
Ask him yourself.

21:51.077 --> 21:55.112
I told you a secret;
now you tell me yours.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.981
No.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.116
What do you mean, no?

21:59.118 --> 22:01.485
I mean... No.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.854
We had a deal.
Tell me your secret. Now.

22:08.026 --> 22:11.262
You're making me angry, dot.

22:11.264 --> 22:12.963
(whispers):
What's the matter with you?

22:12.965 --> 22:15.032
<i>Tell him something. Anything.</i>

22:15.034 --> 22:17.868
He lied about jimmy.

22:18.837 --> 22:21.138
I did not.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.841
I did not lie, you bitch!

22:23.843 --> 22:26.110
I don't like
this game anymore!

22:26.112 --> 22:29.947
You're not playing by the rules!

22:40.859 --> 22:43.127
(gasps)
shh.

22:43.129 --> 22:45.062
Anybody see you
come out here?

22:45.064 --> 22:47.131
No. Everyone's
either asleep

22:47.133 --> 22:48.966
Or drunk or in some
drug-induced haze.

22:48.968 --> 22:50.968
So what's the scoop?

22:50.970 --> 22:52.903
The twins are
gone for sure.
Shit.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.305
Nobody knows
exactly where.

22:54.307 --> 22:55.906
Elsa claims
they left town.

22:55.908 --> 22:57.308
That's bullshit.

22:57.310 --> 22:59.477
Twin girls don't
get a bus ticket out of town

22:59.479 --> 23:00.911
Without somebody noticing.

23:00.913 --> 23:02.413
Well, they're not
on the grounds.

23:02.415 --> 23:05.416
Fine, so forget the twins,
for now. But I need a payday.

23:05.418 --> 23:07.485
We got to have something we can
transport-- something easy.

23:07.487 --> 23:08.753
I...

23:08.755 --> 23:10.154
(clicks tongue)

23:10.156 --> 23:11.922
Fresh catch of the day.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.023
Jimmy?

23:13.025 --> 23:14.725
Yeah.
Just the lobster claws.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.161
Uh, you, what... You want
to cut off his hands?

23:17.163 --> 23:20.564
Don't be squeamish. We're not
gonna do it while he's alive.

23:20.566 --> 23:21.932
Here.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.567
What's this?

23:23.569 --> 23:25.569
These are directions
to the barn I'm renting.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.671
You lure him out there.

23:27.673 --> 23:29.774
You, uh, shake
your pert little bottom,

23:29.776 --> 23:32.042
And I'll be waiting.
I can't.

23:32.044 --> 23:34.445
Why not?

23:34.447 --> 23:36.847
Because he's leaving.
That's perfect.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.749
That way, nobody will ask any
questions when he goes missing.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.584
Stanley, think about
all the blood.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.720
I mean, there'd be so much
to clean up, we'd have to

23:42.722 --> 23:44.855
Get rid of a body-- I mean,
there's just too many ways

23:44.857 --> 23:47.625
That could go south.
You got a better idea?

23:47.627 --> 23:49.360
I, uh...

23:51.630 --> 23:53.397
Actually, I do.

23:53.399 --> 23:55.232
You want something
easy to transport?
Yeah.

23:55.234 --> 23:56.634
I got just the thing.

23:56.636 --> 23:58.102
And it won't even fight back.

23:59.137 --> 24:02.440
You nice lady.
(giggles)

24:02.442 --> 24:05.976
Maggie: <i>It'll be quick, easy,</i>
<i>and nothing for us to clean up.</i>

24:05.978 --> 24:07.445
Ma petite:
<i>Hey!</i>

24:07.447 --> 24:09.313
Got some lungs on her
for such a little thing.

24:09.315 --> 24:10.314
Ma petite:
Let me out!

24:10.316 --> 24:11.949
Hey! Hey!

24:11.951 --> 24:13.951
Let me out!

24:13.953 --> 24:15.052
Hey!

24:15.054 --> 24:17.121
Let me out! Hey!

24:17.123 --> 24:18.823
(whispers):
Ah, ah, ah.

24:18.825 --> 24:20.124
(yelling)

24:21.092 --> 24:24.495
Hey, let me out! Hey!

24:28.600 --> 24:30.668
(muffled grunting)

24:32.737 --> 24:34.672
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

24:34.674 --> 24:36.740
(grunting stops)

24:48.320 --> 24:51.121
Maggie: <i>We can shred</i>
<i>some of her clothes,</i>

24:51.123 --> 24:53.190
Dump them in the bog.

24:53.192 --> 24:56.160
Everyone will think
some animal got to her.

24:56.162 --> 24:59.830
Boy... You are ruthless.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.899
When I have to be.

25:12.878 --> 25:14.845

25:33.199 --> 25:37.701
¶ and these few

25:37.703 --> 25:41.372
¶ precious days

25:41.374 --> 25:46.877
¶ I'll spend with you

25:46.879 --> 25:52.149
¶ these precious days

25:52.151 --> 25:55.252
¶ I'll spend

25:55.254 --> 26:02.259
¶ with you...

26:04.996 --> 26:08.899
A little culture
for the tv viewers.

26:08.901 --> 26:12.403
God knows they need it.

26:12.405 --> 26:15.172
Well... Do you think
they'll like it?

26:15.174 --> 26:17.908
I think they'll love it.

26:19.277 --> 26:21.579
Sleep well.

26:21.581 --> 26:23.647
Wait. You're
not staying?

26:25.584 --> 26:28.619
Um, well, I'm just
a bit dodgy tonight.

26:28.621 --> 26:30.955
I've got a lot
on my mind.

26:30.957 --> 26:33.958
I wouldn't want
to disappoint you.

26:33.960 --> 26:37.895
What have you got on your mind,
lover boy, huh?

26:37.897 --> 26:40.130
Come over here.

26:41.199 --> 26:42.466
Hmm?

26:42.468 --> 26:45.102
Just a good night kiss.

26:50.942 --> 26:53.978
You reek of venetian romance.

26:53.980 --> 26:57.081
I can't imagine
any of my monsters

26:57.083 --> 26:59.383
Wearing perfume.

26:59.385 --> 27:02.486
So tell me...

27:02.488 --> 27:04.888
Who are you screwing?

27:04.890 --> 27:08.726
I don't believe, mum,
that's any of your business.

27:10.962 --> 27:12.730
It's all my business,
you prick.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.001
Who are you
to talk to me like that?

27:17.003 --> 27:18.836
Who am I?

27:18.838 --> 27:21.505
Who are you?
That's the real question.

27:21.507 --> 27:23.774
You're certainly
not the fairy queen

27:23.776 --> 27:25.476
You pretend to be--
quite the opposite.

27:25.478 --> 27:28.112
It seems to me that

27:28.114 --> 27:29.947
We're all
here to serve

27:29.949 --> 27:32.650
Your deceitful and demonic soul!

27:32.652 --> 27:36.153
Now, tell me...
Where are those twins?

27:36.155 --> 27:38.155
The truth.
Everyone's talking.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.456
Everyone?

27:39.458 --> 27:41.325
Talking about what?

27:41.327 --> 27:43.661
The general consensus
is that you've done

27:43.663 --> 27:45.863
Something nefarious
with those girls!

27:45.865 --> 27:48.966
<i>Shise.</i> Pure <i>shise.</i>

27:48.968 --> 27:50.968
Go wake them all up.

27:50.970 --> 27:53.103
Wake them up!

27:58.443 --> 27:59.677
(mutters)

27:59.679 --> 28:00.778
No!

28:00.780 --> 28:03.380
No, no, no, no, no!

28:05.350 --> 28:07.151
Oh!

28:07.153 --> 28:09.053
You ungrateful ingrates!

28:09.055 --> 28:11.321
I rescue you
from the squalor

28:11.323 --> 28:14.958
Of your miserable existences,

28:14.960 --> 28:17.528
And this is
how you repay me? Huh?

28:17.530 --> 28:21.165
With accusations,
disgusting rumors!

28:21.167 --> 28:24.201
Now, which one of you believes
that I had anything to do

28:24.203 --> 28:26.570
With the disappearance
of those girls? Huh?

28:26.572 --> 28:27.871
Speak up!

28:27.873 --> 28:29.840
But you're not shy

28:29.842 --> 28:32.009
About gossiping
behind my back, are you?

28:32.011 --> 28:33.143
Go ahead, say it!

28:33.145 --> 28:35.546
Say it to my face!

28:35.548 --> 28:39.016
Toulouse, have you forgotten
where I found you? Huh?

28:39.018 --> 28:40.918
Shackled to that
chain gang,

28:40.920 --> 28:43.187
Chipping away at rocks
with that pathetic

28:43.189 --> 28:45.222
Baby pickaxe? Huh?

28:45.224 --> 28:48.092
Have you forgotten

28:48.094 --> 28:51.428
Who bribed the guard
to let you out? Who?!

28:51.430 --> 28:54.164
Elsa, you got it all wrong.

28:54.933 --> 28:56.533
You two.

28:56.535 --> 29:00.404
Rotting away in that
shit-smeared orphanage!

29:00.406 --> 29:02.372
Huh?

29:02.374 --> 29:06.009
Even your sister didn't
want you anymore!

29:06.011 --> 29:07.878
Your family
sent you away!

29:07.880 --> 29:11.582
You'd still be lying there
in that urine-soaked mattress,

29:11.584 --> 29:14.585
Starving, gnawing on rats
(whimpering)

29:14.587 --> 29:17.588
If I hadn't pulled you
into the spotlight.

29:18.256 --> 29:19.289
Look at these.

29:19.291 --> 29:21.725
Look at these!

29:21.727 --> 29:23.627
Trinkets!

29:23.629 --> 29:27.064
Shabbily made!

29:27.066 --> 29:29.066
Confectioneries!

29:29.068 --> 29:31.034
They're all
meaningless!

29:31.036 --> 29:33.804
Meaningless! Meaningless!

29:33.806 --> 29:36.373
You should be ashamed.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.244
After everything
that I have done for you, huh?

29:40.246 --> 29:44.047
Everything that
I have sacrificed for us.

29:44.049 --> 29:46.450
(sobs softly)

29:46.452 --> 29:49.086
For our family.

29:49.088 --> 29:53.423
And I still...
Have not won your trust.

29:53.425 --> 29:55.092
Jimmy:
Elsa,

29:55.094 --> 29:56.093
Calm down, please.

29:56.095 --> 29:57.494
Of course we trust you.

29:57.496 --> 30:00.130
Prove it to me!

30:00.132 --> 30:01.965
How?

30:01.967 --> 30:04.434
T-tell us...

30:04.436 --> 30:06.103
A way.

30:06.105 --> 30:08.672
How can we
convince you?

30:11.810 --> 30:14.077
The wheel!

30:14.079 --> 30:19.750
Nobody leaves here
until one of you is strapped in

30:19.752 --> 30:21.752
And proves to me

30:21.754 --> 30:24.288
Your unadulterated
trust and loyalty.

30:24.290 --> 30:27.591
I will settle
for nothing less.

30:30.762 --> 30:33.463
I'll do it.

30:33.465 --> 30:35.098
No. Me.

30:37.035 --> 30:40.070
It should be me.

30:54.686 --> 30:55.953
Try not to miss.

30:55.955 --> 30:57.955
I always miss, darling.

30:57.957 --> 31:00.057
That's the point.

31:08.666 --> 31:10.234
Ladies and gentlemen,

31:10.236 --> 31:14.872
Prepare yourselves for
the most death-defying scene.

31:14.874 --> 31:17.808
It takes but a
split second

31:17.810 --> 31:20.677
For this knife to travel
from my fingertips

31:20.679 --> 31:22.746
To the edge
of the wheel.

31:22.748 --> 31:24.982
A split second...

31:24.984 --> 31:27.484
That separates life from death.

31:27.486 --> 31:29.987
Spin the wheel, eve.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.892
(wheel creaking)

31:42.000 --> 31:43.634
(others scream)

31:44.602 --> 31:46.503
Now, you may think

31:46.505 --> 31:50.908
That this man's destiny
rests in miss elsa's hands.

31:50.910 --> 31:52.709
But fate

31:52.711 --> 31:54.778
Is the true master of us all.

32:04.756 --> 32:05.656
(others scream)

32:07.058 --> 32:09.293
And yet...

32:09.295 --> 32:12.896
Fate is not unkind.

32:12.898 --> 32:16.400
Reversal of fortune
can be swift.

32:16.402 --> 32:19.036
The pauper can be made king.

32:28.646 --> 32:30.147
(grunts)

32:30.149 --> 32:31.148
Oh, no!

32:31.150 --> 32:33.917
Jimmy:
Get him down!

32:33.919 --> 32:36.219
Get him down!
Elsa: Oh, my god!
What have I done?!

32:36.221 --> 32:38.121
No, no!
It was an accident!

32:39.424 --> 32:41.725
Oh, god.

32:43.294 --> 32:45.462
No, evie, don't!

32:45.464 --> 32:47.664
Oh! We need a doctor.
(groaning)

32:47.666 --> 32:49.266
Call a doctor!
I'll see to it.

32:49.268 --> 32:50.901
Take him to the caravan.

32:50.903 --> 32:53.236
(groaning)

33:18.162 --> 33:20.097
(gun cocks)

33:20.099 --> 33:21.465
Don't take
another step.

33:21.467 --> 33:24.001
Jesus christ, daddy.

33:24.003 --> 33:26.003
A gun?
It's 2:00 in the morning.

33:26.005 --> 33:27.104
You could've been
a goddamn intruder.

33:27.106 --> 33:28.305
Go back to your room.

33:28.307 --> 33:30.073
Or what, you'll shoot me?

33:32.010 --> 33:33.510
Here's the scoop, dad.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.479
I'm in love, and I'm gonna

33:35.481 --> 33:37.047
Go see him right now.

33:37.049 --> 33:38.548
I'm gonna have a life

33:38.550 --> 33:41.685
That means something,
a life with some excitement,

33:41.687 --> 33:43.687
A life that's real.

33:43.689 --> 33:47.057
Not this goddamn
middle-class hell.

33:47.059 --> 33:48.658
You're not
going anywhere!

33:48.660 --> 33:51.428
Are you gonna
shoot me?

33:52.463 --> 33:54.364
Well, go on then.

33:54.366 --> 33:57.134
(laughs): I'd rather die
right here on this staircase

33:57.136 --> 34:00.237
Than live in this house
with you another minute.

34:08.413 --> 34:10.480
(door slams)

34:27.165 --> 34:28.632
Shh.

34:46.250 --> 34:49.052
The moon is beautiful.

34:49.054 --> 34:50.120
Yes.

34:50.122 --> 34:51.388
You are beautiful.

34:51.390 --> 34:53.390
(chuckles):
Oh... Quiet.

34:53.392 --> 34:55.192
Where we go?

34:55.194 --> 34:57.561
There, that barn.
That's where your surprise is.

34:57.563 --> 34:58.962
A pony?

34:58.964 --> 35:01.932
I dream to ride a pony.
(laughs)

35:01.934 --> 35:04.000
(ma petite giggling)

35:06.404 --> 35:08.972
(sighs)
we're gonna play a game.

35:08.974 --> 35:11.208
I like games.

35:11.210 --> 35:12.742
(sighs)

35:12.744 --> 35:14.978
I'm gonna put you
in this jar, okay?

35:14.980 --> 35:17.114
Like butterfly?

35:17.116 --> 35:19.816
Yeah. Like a butterfly.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.537
¶

36:01.459 --> 36:04.461
Penny...
You came back.

36:04.463 --> 36:06.096
Yes.

36:06.098 --> 36:09.132
I... I'm looking
for paul.

36:09.134 --> 36:10.967
What's going on?

36:10.969 --> 36:12.202
What happened?

36:12.204 --> 36:14.171
(inhales)

36:14.173 --> 36:16.239
How is the pain, <i>liebchen?</i>

36:18.109 --> 36:19.943
Oh, here.

36:19.945 --> 36:22.012
Here. Have some more.

36:25.816 --> 36:27.951
(coughing)

36:27.953 --> 36:31.688
You know, the irony of it,

36:31.690 --> 36:36.059
I mean, after all
the <i>sturm und drang...</i>

36:37.995 --> 36:40.363
...I don't think that the
spinning wheel act is right

36:40.365 --> 36:42.365
For <i>the elsa mars hour.</i>

36:42.367 --> 36:46.336
I think it is too raw, too
difficult for most viewers.

36:46.338 --> 36:48.905
Don't you agree? Hmm?

36:51.142 --> 36:53.310
You never even called
a doctor, did you?

36:53.312 --> 36:55.745
Oh, how can you say that?

36:55.747 --> 36:57.814
You know that's not true.

37:00.084 --> 37:02.652
But, you know...

37:05.590 --> 37:09.025
...I would not shed a
tear if you were to die.

37:09.027 --> 37:12.495
Not because
you're a freak,

37:12.497 --> 37:14.998
But because
you betrayed me.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.933
(door opens)
penny:
Oh, my god!

37:16.935 --> 37:19.369
I knew something had happened
when you didn't come!

37:19.371 --> 37:21.471
Speaking of
cheap perfume.

37:23.507 --> 37:25.075
Oh.

37:25.077 --> 37:28.078
I'm sorry... My love.

37:28.080 --> 37:31.414
Don't speak.
Just... Just hold my hand.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.017
How long ago did you call
for the ambulance?

37:34.019 --> 37:35.418
What's taking them
so long?

37:35.420 --> 37:37.087
Well...

37:37.089 --> 37:39.456
I don't know. They don't
seem to be in any rush.

37:44.028 --> 37:45.929
Help!

37:54.372 --> 37:56.273
Really, ma?

37:56.275 --> 37:58.041
You're making a cake?

37:58.043 --> 37:59.476
Cake was made.

37:59.478 --> 38:01.244
No point in leaving
off the frosting.

38:01.246 --> 38:04.347
Ma, paul could die.

38:05.616 --> 38:07.617
I said a prayer for him.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.386
Not much else I could do.

38:09.388 --> 38:11.154
What did the doctor say?

38:11.156 --> 38:13.590
The doctor never came.
But elsa said...

38:13.592 --> 38:16.126
Elsa said a lot of things,
like the twins ran away,

38:16.128 --> 38:17.994
But I'm not so sure,
and neither was paul.

38:17.996 --> 38:20.230
He tried to tell me,
but I didn't want to hear it.

38:20.232 --> 38:22.565
If elsa says, the twins ran off,

38:22.567 --> 38:24.334
Then the twins ran off.

38:24.336 --> 38:26.136
That's the end of the story.

38:26.138 --> 38:27.470
Amazon eve:
Jimmy?

38:27.472 --> 38:28.905
Jimmy, you in there?
(knocking)

38:28.907 --> 38:31.274
Is it paul?
No. It's ma petite.

38:31.276 --> 38:32.842
Something's happened to her.
What?

38:32.844 --> 38:34.144
What happened?
I don't know.

38:34.146 --> 38:36.079
She wasn't at
breakfast this morning.

38:36.081 --> 38:39.115
She never misses breakfast.
I don't know where she puts it.

38:39.117 --> 38:41.084
I checked her trailer,
but she's not there.

38:41.086 --> 38:43.086
All right, listen,
don't panic, all right?

38:43.088 --> 38:45.689
We're just gonna round up
everybody, okay?

38:45.691 --> 38:46.856
(both laughing)

38:46.858 --> 38:49.326
Where you two been?

38:49.328 --> 38:53.129
We got up before sunrise
and went hunting fireflies.

38:53.131 --> 38:54.497
Suzi made hotcakes.

38:54.499 --> 38:56.599
Hotcakes!
Mm-hmm.

38:56.601 --> 38:58.134
You two coming?

38:58.136 --> 39:00.370
You guys go ahead.
Okay.

39:01.539 --> 39:03.773
Fireflies, huh?

39:03.775 --> 39:05.642
Yeah.

39:05.644 --> 39:07.043
Though I think
she'd prefer a pony.

39:07.045 --> 39:08.345
Who wouldn't?

39:12.216 --> 39:13.149
Listen.

39:13.151 --> 39:15.452
Let's run away together.

39:15.454 --> 39:16.953
Jesus.
If-if we leave now,

39:16.955 --> 39:19.322
We can make it to pensacola
before dark.

39:19.324 --> 39:22.459
Or south to miami,
or even the keys.

39:22.461 --> 39:24.961
I don't care where we go,
so long as it's together.

39:24.963 --> 39:26.629
Do you really mean it?

39:26.631 --> 39:29.199
Damn right I do.

39:34.238 --> 39:36.840
Just one thing I
have to do first.

39:36.842 --> 39:38.174
What?

39:38.176 --> 39:40.110
Just have your bags packed.

39:50.154 --> 39:51.921
(whistles)

39:51.923 --> 39:54.023
Hi.
(gasps)

39:54.025 --> 39:55.358
This is the ticket
I was gonna use

39:55.360 --> 39:57.026
To go to philadelphia tonight.

39:57.028 --> 39:58.928
Had plans
to visit a certain museum.

39:58.930 --> 40:02.031
In fact, I had
called said museum,

40:02.033 --> 40:04.601
Long distance, to tell them
a package was arriving.

40:04.603 --> 40:06.403
Wait, let me explain. I...

40:06.405 --> 40:08.071
No, no, no. No. No, no, no.

40:08.073 --> 40:10.173
Let me explain to you.

40:12.676 --> 40:16.746
If your corpse were half
as valuable as ma petite,

40:16.748 --> 40:19.015
You'd be soaking in
formaldehyde right now.

40:19.017 --> 40:22.419
Luckily for you, your dead
body isn't worth anything.

40:22.421 --> 40:24.421
The twins are
still missing.

40:24.423 --> 40:26.055
All the freaks
are on high alert.

40:26.057 --> 40:27.757
I can't just walk
out of camp with her.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.359
No more excuses.
I'm turning this in,

40:29.361 --> 40:31.628
The cost of which will be
deducted from your share,

40:31.630 --> 40:32.929
For the next train
to philadelphia.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.731
And we're going
back to my plan.

40:34.733 --> 40:37.033
Which is what?

40:37.035 --> 40:40.403
Get jimmy to the shed.

40:40.405 --> 40:43.706
I'm bringing those lobster
claws to the museum.

41:12.970 --> 41:14.971
Dandy, I brought you snackies!

41:14.973 --> 41:16.973
Dandy:
Go away!

41:16.975 --> 41:18.808
I have rc cola, too!

41:18.810 --> 41:20.310
(crying)

41:20.312 --> 41:23.179
Darling, why are you crying?

41:25.082 --> 41:26.816
Don't fret.

41:26.818 --> 41:28.618
I sent the twins
on a constitutional

41:28.620 --> 41:30.687
Across the grounds
to get some fresh air.

41:30.689 --> 41:32.255
They'll be back in half an hour.

41:35.025 --> 41:37.694
(crying)

41:37.696 --> 41:40.096
Is this what has
made you so upset?

41:40.098 --> 41:42.165
It's dot's.

41:42.167 --> 41:44.133
(sniffles)

41:44.135 --> 41:46.169
Read it.

41:47.137 --> 41:49.472
Read it out loud.

41:49.474 --> 41:52.942
I want to hear it out loud
so I know it's real.

41:52.944 --> 41:55.211
"Wednesday. Oh, my god,

41:55.213 --> 41:58.314
"when can we get out
of this dreadful place?

41:58.316 --> 42:03.386
"the house is a palace,
but that man-boy, yuck.

42:03.388 --> 42:06.389
"I've begun to associate
the taste of caviar

42:06.391 --> 42:10.059
"with the pain of listening
to him drone on and on

42:10.061 --> 42:12.529
"about the most boring subjects.

42:12.531 --> 42:15.698
"and I lived my life
a shut-in for 30 years,

42:15.700 --> 42:18.968
"so boring me
is not easy to do.

42:18.970 --> 42:23.740
"I suppose I must continue
to tolerate him in order to keep

42:23.742 --> 42:26.075
"collecting enough money
for the surgery.

42:26.077 --> 42:28.912
"he gives me
a ten dollar bill

42:28.914 --> 42:32.148
"every time I laugh
at one of his terrible jokes.

42:32.150 --> 42:34.551
"I'd rather die
than kiss him.

42:34.553 --> 42:36.152
"oh, well,

42:36.154 --> 42:37.720
"at least the good news

42:37.722 --> 42:39.923
"about the brodie twins
lifts my spirits.

42:39.925 --> 42:42.892
Shame about
the dead one."

42:42.894 --> 42:45.328
Oh, darling.

42:49.166 --> 42:52.268
The other one still adores you,
doesn't she?

42:52.270 --> 42:56.172
I know. Let's give the one who
likes you one of my fox stoles

42:56.174 --> 42:57.840
Or a tennis bracelet.

42:57.842 --> 42:59.576
The other one will
be green with envy

42:59.578 --> 43:01.277
And be practically begging
for your affection

43:01.279 --> 43:04.547
In no time at all.

43:04.549 --> 43:07.150
I don't want
to buy love!

43:09.086 --> 43:11.721
I wish you could be
inside my body

43:11.723 --> 43:14.390
For one minute to know
what it feels like to be me!

43:14.392 --> 43:17.360
It's like
when I had tuberculosis,

43:17.362 --> 43:20.597
And you took me out
to the utah desert,

43:20.599 --> 43:24.467
And there was nothing
but dry open space

43:24.469 --> 43:26.603
For hundreds of miles around us.

43:26.605 --> 43:29.372
That is what is
inside of me.

43:29.374 --> 43:35.044
Those girls were a cool stream
of glacier water.

43:35.046 --> 43:38.314
My heart bloomed
as they nourished it.

43:40.484 --> 43:43.720
And now it's all gone.

43:43.722 --> 43:47.223
There is nothing left
but the dust

43:47.225 --> 43:50.193
And the scorpions inside of me.

43:52.930 --> 43:56.799
I was never destined
to feel love.

43:56.801 --> 43:59.335
(panting)

44:06.343 --> 44:08.845
The desert knows no mercy.

44:12.683 --> 44:15.752
Anything you try
to plant out there dies.

44:19.123 --> 44:22.592
I must accept this emptiness

44:22.594 --> 44:26.396
As a blessing, not a curse.

44:33.604 --> 44:36.873
I know why
I was put here, mother.

44:38.776 --> 44:41.377
My purpose is to bring death.

45:00.497 --> 45:02.565
(doorbell rings)

45:15.379 --> 45:18.281
(doorbell rings twice)

45:29.560 --> 45:31.194
Gloria:
Can I help you?

45:31.196 --> 45:33.329
I'm here to see your son.
I'm a friend of his.

45:33.331 --> 45:34.797
My son has no friends.

45:36.834 --> 45:38.935
Hey, it's jimmy
from the freak show.

45:38.937 --> 45:41.037
Remember me?

45:41.039 --> 45:43.673
Let him in, mother.

45:43.675 --> 45:45.942
He's here for the girls.

45:55.452 --> 45:57.754
(door closes)

46:09.099 --> 46:11.067
Bad luck for the birthday girl

46:11.069 --> 46:13.369
Not to have a hunk
of her own cake.

46:13.371 --> 46:15.438
(chuckles softly)

46:15.440 --> 46:17.874
And the rest?

46:17.876 --> 46:20.143
They're with paul.

46:20.145 --> 46:24.113
I think they just don't feel
like celebrating right now.

46:24.115 --> 46:25.948
Of course not.

46:25.950 --> 46:28.551
A family must come together
when tragedy strikes.

46:28.553 --> 46:33.489
And we are the only family
most of us have ever known.

46:41.632 --> 46:43.699
I had a sister once.

46:47.471 --> 46:51.107
She was born
two years before me,

46:51.109 --> 46:53.309
But she died as an infant.

46:55.245 --> 46:59.081
I don't think
my parents ever recovered.

47:01.151 --> 47:05.521
I think <i>I</i> was meant
to heal their pain, but...

47:05.523 --> 47:06.989
(chuckles)

47:06.991 --> 47:09.959
...I just reminded them

47:09.961 --> 47:12.028
Of what was lost.

47:13.964 --> 47:16.566
I had to create
a family.

47:18.635 --> 47:21.537
Everyone here--

47:21.539 --> 47:23.973
They are all my babies.

47:23.975 --> 47:26.242
My special ones.

47:29.813 --> 47:31.881
I love them all.

47:31.883 --> 47:34.050
(chuckles softly)

47:34.052 --> 47:36.619
But you...

47:41.358 --> 47:43.893
You are the sister...

47:47.998 --> 47:50.166
...I never met.

47:50.168 --> 47:52.201
(crying softly)

47:54.171 --> 47:56.839
That's why I saved you

47:56.841 --> 48:00.743
From that hell
you were in.

48:00.745 --> 48:03.379
Why don't they know my heart?

48:05.749 --> 48:07.984
You got one in the belly.

48:07.986 --> 48:10.920
(sighs)

48:10.922 --> 48:13.522
Between that
and the twins disappearing,

48:13.524 --> 48:16.058
Faith and loyalty

48:16.060 --> 48:18.895
Only take people so far.

48:20.831 --> 48:22.899
(sniffles)

48:26.270 --> 48:28.337
(sighs)

48:39.082 --> 48:42.919
I'll tell you one thing.

48:42.921 --> 48:45.288
If I ever find out
you were lying

48:45.290 --> 48:48.758
And did wrong
by those girls,

48:48.760 --> 48:53.029
I'll kill you
with my own two hands.

48:57.868 --> 49:02.204
Now... Make a wish.

49:02.206 --> 49:09.378
Elsa:
<i>I just want to be loved.</i>

49:09.380 --> 49:11.948
