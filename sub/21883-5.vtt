WEBVTT

00:36.286 --> 00:37.162
They're here.

00:53.636 --> 00:56.139
ALTATA BAY HOTEL

01:02.145 --> 01:02.979
Your weapons.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.401
Nobody is armed in there.

01:45.605 --> 01:48.274
Your dogs killed my brother,
and you want me in the Federation?

01:48.650 --> 01:49.567
We're at war.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.530
If we divide,
the Golfo will win territory.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.574
If you stay, we can end Cano...

01:56.950 --> 01:58.660
and have total control of the business.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.791
-Hand them over, then we'll talk.
-I won't hand anybody over.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.713
If you go, think about it.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.844
If you leave the Federation,
Cano will come after you.

02:18.346 --> 02:20.557
You know you can't face him on your own.

02:21.599 --> 02:23.643
Family comes first. You killed my brother.

02:23.726 --> 02:24.561
You're right.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.856
But you also know Rodolfo
crossed the line.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.818
What he did to Jaguar was
a direct threat to me.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.115
Of course family comes first.

02:38.199 --> 02:39.742
But think about the business, Chente.

02:40.326 --> 02:43.413
Now is the time to think with
your head, not with your feelings.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.459
It's better if we're together.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.421
You know that's best for the business.

03:19.073 --> 03:20.783
Double the security
for the family in Culiacan.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.578
I don't trust this fucker.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.332
Call Raciel's lawyer.

03:27.790 --> 03:29.375
Tell them I have a proposal.

03:48.102 --> 03:52.148
<i>I feel the warmth</i>
<i>From my boiling blood</i>

03:52.732 --> 03:56.778
<i>I feel the fear</i>
<i>Sweat dripping away</i>

03:56.861 --> 04:00.907
<i>There's a stillness</i>
<i>That nothing transmits</i>

04:01.616 --> 04:07.789
<i>I'm a breeze that grows stronger</i>

04:07.997 --> 04:11.125
<i>Even when the clouds drift away</i>

04:12.252 --> 04:16.005
<i>Even when my skin dries away</i>

04:16.631 --> 04:20.093
<i>I'll be back someday</i>

04:21.094 --> 04:25.223
<i>To unleash my return</i>

04:29.769 --> 04:33.690
<i>I have the dust </i>
<i>That protects the road</i>

04:33.898 --> 04:38.069
<i>I have the branches</i>
<i>Of a leafless tree</i>

04:38.778 --> 04:42.740
<i>I'm the guardian of the tired night</i>

04:42.949 --> 04:48.997
<i>There are silhouettes</i>
<i>That come to meet me</i>

04:49.622 --> 04:54.002
<i>Even when the clouds drift away</i>

04:54.127 --> 04:57.088
<i>Even when my skin dries away</i>

04:58.131 --> 05:01.718
<i>I'll be back someday</i>

05:02.844 --> 05:06.723
<i>To unleash my return</i>

05:10.768 --> 05:12.937
Chapo and his people
can't take the territory.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.647
RACIEL'S SAFE HOUSE

05:14.772 --> 05:16.899
-Are the access roads blocked?
-Yes, sir.

05:17.191 --> 05:19.319
We have security on all access roads.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.030
Nobody comes in or out without us knowing.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.574
You're in charge
of protecting Nuevo Laredo.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.451
We're all going out.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.330
It's our turn to hit Chapo.

05:33.416 --> 05:37.336
SAFE HOUSE

05:37.754 --> 05:38.588
It's good.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.424
Get someone to furnish it.

05:42.091 --> 05:44.260
-Don't you want Mrs. Graciela to do it?
-No.

05:44.552 --> 05:45.928
Graciela stays at her house.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.181
During the war, I'd rather live alone.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.033
This is it.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.119
You only have to hide it in the restroom.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.080
You know what to do.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.628
Do you want the money or not?

06:23.800 --> 06:26.052
You can have the rest
when you complete the job.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.530
"JR"
CHENTE'S LIEUTENANT

06:46.656 --> 06:49.742
MEXICO CITY

07:11.556 --> 07:13.850
YOUR BIRTHDAY IS CLOSE
AND WE WANT TO CELEBRATE

07:44.714 --> 07:47.133
FRANCO

07:56.184 --> 07:57.310
Are you free tomorrow?

07:59.770 --> 08:02.565
It will be hard to convince
Nazario to join the Federation.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.150
We're partners of Raciel.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.444
If the Golfo doesn't join...

08:06.527 --> 08:07.445
neither will we.

08:07.945 --> 08:10.239
The majority of his business
comes from meth.

08:10.573 --> 08:14.160
If we block the product exits,
we will harm his income.

08:15.536 --> 08:17.038
Maybe that will convince him, right?

08:17.830 --> 08:18.956
That takes time.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.709
Cano could solve this quickly.

08:22.084 --> 08:23.961
How do you plan to convince him?

08:26.214 --> 08:27.632
I'll pay him a visit.

08:34.222 --> 08:37.767
<i>"You will hear in the sky,</i>
<i>in your dwelling place,</i>

08:38.518 --> 08:41.562
and you will forgive, and act.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.191
You'll see each one,
according to their paths.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.652
Whose heart you know.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.531
Now my eyes will be open,

08:52.573 --> 08:54.033
and my ears will be attentive,

08:55.117 --> 08:56.577
with prayer in this place."

09:04.669 --> 09:05.836
Teacher!

09:10.258 --> 09:11.092
Oh, my God!

09:11.175 --> 09:12.885
Go now, this isn't your problem.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.936
That's not the way
to get into the Lord's house.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.413
Happy birthday.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.440
Hey!

10:16.699 --> 10:17.867
No, not today.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.910
It's your birthday present.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.416
You know the rules.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.388
I don't know what you want.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.475
-But this is not the way to get it.
-We'll see.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.987
Let's negotiate your
integration into the Federation.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.616
We'll stay here until you join.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.912
The easy way, or the hard way.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.296
-Bracelets, buddy?
-No, thank you.

11:56.507 --> 11:57.341
Is it good stuff?

11:58.467 --> 12:00.553
That's a silly question.
It's the best kind.

12:01.637 --> 12:02.555
It's Chapo's stuff.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.765
-How much?
-200 pesos.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.475
"EME 16"
CANO'S LIEUTENANT

12:08.686 --> 12:09.728
Thanks, man.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.494
-Bracelets?
-Shut up, fucker.

12:37.965 --> 12:40.092
EMES' SAFE HOUSE

12:59.111 --> 13:02.615
Let's teach Chapo
that he shouldn't play with us.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.223
What will it take for you to join us?

13:30.809 --> 13:33.103
I already told you we offer
protection from the DEA

13:33.729 --> 13:35.189
so you can move your weed to the U.S.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.820
Safety here in Mexico,
so you can move your meth.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.739
Cano doesn't offer any of that,

13:43.822 --> 13:46.033
he only lets you move drugs
in his territory.

13:47.201 --> 13:48.536
You'll have more with us.

13:48.786 --> 13:51.288
Joaquín, I'm a man of my word.

13:52.122 --> 13:53.499
I don't care who's leader,

13:54.500 --> 13:56.168
I have a commitment with the Golfo.

13:57.419 --> 13:59.004
I'm Cano's partner.

13:59.588 --> 14:02.049
Just like God's word must be respected,

14:03.509 --> 14:06.428
so the agreements with men
must be respected.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.862
Leave the sermon for the pulpit.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.905
Think about what's best for your business.

14:25.155 --> 14:26.448
For my business or for you?

14:27.741 --> 14:30.744
You want to have power,
but it's the Lord who gives and takes.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.413
You can't go above Him, Joaquín.

14:33.664 --> 14:35.249
He always tells us what's best.

14:35.332 --> 14:38.085
Only He can guide our destiny.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.213
ALMOLOYA PRISON

16:27.611 --> 16:29.488
Don't choose the hard path, Nazario.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.657
You're more useful alive than dead.

16:31.740 --> 16:32.992
I don't fear death.

16:33.909 --> 16:35.661
My spirit is with the man above.

16:35.869 --> 16:37.246
You're really stubborn.

16:37.621 --> 16:39.415
If you kill me,
my people won't follow you.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.834
They're loyal to me.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.544
If I kill you, they won't remember you.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.588
They only care about your money and power.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.632
That's the only loyalty there is.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.801
Don't underestimate God's power, Joaquín.

16:52.219 --> 16:54.096
I was an alcoholic when God rescued me.

16:54.346 --> 16:57.683
He entrusted me to make the Michoacan
family, to take care of people.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.560
And to protect each other.

17:00.394 --> 17:01.854
Money is not our motivation.

17:02.813 --> 17:03.689
Faith is.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.941
You'll need more than faith
to get out of this.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.737
-God performs miracles.
-I've had it with your bullshit.

17:09.987 --> 17:12.448
I want your organization
to work for the Federation.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.909
If you're not in, you won't have anything.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.411
While you wait for a miracle,

17:17.494 --> 17:19.913
my men wait for orders to take
down your producers.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.290
An order from me,

17:21.749 --> 17:23.459
and you're left with no producers.

17:23.625 --> 17:24.585
Got it?

17:36.388 --> 17:37.890
Did the President give you anything?

17:38.432 --> 17:40.017
He doesn't know it's my birthday.

17:41.351 --> 17:45.481
If he knew, the best gift would be
that the asshole learn how to govern.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.446
You know he kicked Fidel Castro
out of Monterrey?

17:53.155 --> 17:54.198
He kicked him out.

17:55.532 --> 17:57.534
From an international summit.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.872
You do know who Fidel Castro is, right?

18:02.748 --> 18:04.374
I'm a prostitute, not a moron.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.256
You would be a good president.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.095
You're drunk.

18:17.471 --> 18:18.305
For real.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.413
That's why I voted for you for congress.

18:45.415 --> 18:46.708
Because I know you.

18:51.713 --> 18:53.924
I'm sure if you had
the chance to be president,

18:54.007 --> 18:56.593
you would be better than
the fuckers who govern us now.

19:42.556 --> 19:44.099
How the fuck did you get in?

19:46.393 --> 19:47.227
Hey, you.

19:49.563 --> 19:50.898
Speak, goddammit.

19:51.648 --> 19:52.900
Joaquín, can you hear me?

19:54.151 --> 19:55.777
The Emes came to Acapulco.

19:56.403 --> 19:57.696
<i>They left you a message.</i>

19:58.322 --> 19:59.865
I'll send you a picture.

19:59.948 --> 20:00.782
CHAPO, ACAPULCO WILL BE OURS.
THE EMES

20:00.866 --> 20:01.992
<i>Take them out of there.</i>

20:02.201 --> 20:03.702
<i>Tell your brother and the </i>Muñeca.

20:03.952 --> 20:05.120
Leave no one alive.

20:07.873 --> 20:08.707
Show it.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.350
Look, motherfucker, what your partner did.

20:27.142 --> 20:28.769
What lecture will you give me now?

20:32.231 --> 20:33.941
All wars have sacrifices.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.568
Even holy wars.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.196
Cano is fighting his enemies.

20:39.821 --> 20:42.574
You, on the other hand,
kill a former ally.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.535
Why would I want to be your ally?

20:45.661 --> 20:46.745
You're stubborn.

20:47.663 --> 20:50.165
You'll see why it's better
to be my ally than my enemy.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.793
Bring me his meth producers.

20:54.461 --> 20:55.879
I want him to see them die.

21:27.869 --> 21:29.288
I have to go to the restroom.

21:29.663 --> 21:30.789
I feel sick.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.247
<i>Graciela thanks you for the gift.</i>

22:12.706 --> 22:14.207
<i>She hopes to use it soon.</i>

22:31.183 --> 22:32.642
Will you let your people die?

22:35.020 --> 22:38.523
I hope God makes you understand not
everything can be solved with bullets.

23:03.507 --> 23:04.341
That's it.

23:05.133 --> 23:08.178
The boss left,
but there are some Emes.

23:09.721 --> 23:10.555
Thanks, man.

23:11.973 --> 23:13.600
You'd better go, it will be ugly.

23:32.285 --> 23:33.370
Hi, counselor.

23:34.037 --> 23:35.413
Do you have good news?

23:37.124 --> 23:38.542
Better than you think, Pollo.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.384
<i>My sheep hear my voice...</i>

23:49.886 --> 23:50.929
and I know them.

23:55.267 --> 23:59.146
<i>They follow me,</i>
<i>and I give them eternal life.</i>

24:18.206 --> 24:19.207
He who believes in me...

24:23.253 --> 24:25.005
he who believes in me...

24:27.424 --> 24:29.092
<i>even in death will he live.</i>

24:32.220 --> 24:34.306
<i>The payment for sin is death.</i>

24:38.518 --> 24:40.604
<i>While God's will</i>

24:42.564 --> 24:45.150
is eternal life, in our lord Jesus Christ.

25:34.032 --> 25:36.785
Sir, it's counselor Loera.

25:37.744 --> 25:38.828
What's up, counselor?

26:00.558 --> 26:01.601
Sir...

26:32.465 --> 26:33.300
What happened?

26:34.801 --> 26:35.927
Is it my dad?

26:37.679 --> 26:38.763
Is your uncle, Arturo.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.905
Arturo, come over.

26:56.323 --> 26:57.991
No way, I'm OK here.

26:58.074 --> 26:59.701
ARTURO MEZA
MORENO'S FRIEND

27:00.910 --> 27:02.871
-What do you think?
-It's really cool.

27:03.204 --> 27:05.623
But I don't understand
why you must work the field.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.000
Given who your dad is.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.711
If I want to join,
I prefer to start from scratch.

27:11.713 --> 27:12.547
Hello?

27:15.050 --> 27:17.802
It's Quino, he sounds weird.

27:21.139 --> 27:21.973
'Sup, brother?

27:27.979 --> 27:29.606
It's time to go to La Tuna.

27:38.448 --> 27:43.745
"HEAVEN" RANCH

29:39.027 --> 29:41.321
I don't suppose you're calling
to give your condolences?

29:42.614 --> 29:43.448
<i>No.</i>

29:44.157 --> 29:47.035
<i>I call to remind you that you offer</i>
<i>control and earnings.</i>

29:47.994 --> 29:49.996
Don't make a war against Juarez, Joaquín.

29:51.706 --> 29:53.124
I'm sorry about your brother.

29:55.585 --> 29:57.337
<i>But our deal comes first.</i>

30:15.355 --> 30:17.315
I swear you'll always be safe.

30:22.612 --> 30:24.447
You'll avenge my uncle, right, Dad?

32:17.477 --> 32:20.271
We took the Emes from Acapulco,
but they will be restless.

32:21.606 --> 32:24.776
We left the <i>Muñeca, </i>preparing
an unforgettable message.

32:26.027 --> 32:28.321
-Was it Chente?
-Yes.

32:29.447 --> 32:31.324
The man who shot him already confessed.

32:33.576 --> 32:35.244
Chente asked Raciel for help.

32:36.704 --> 32:38.873
Your brother's death
can't be left like that.

32:40.458 --> 32:43.002
Say the word, we're here.

33:30.258 --> 33:31.092
Joaquín.

33:32.510 --> 33:35.638
Leave the business before another
relative dies.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.144
Hello?

34:23.770 --> 34:27.273
<i>Joaquín? Chente called you.</i>

34:29.859 --> 34:31.486
<i>He wants to meet with you.</i>

34:37.408 --> 34:38.326
What do I tell him?

34:41.037 --> 34:41.871
<i>Joaquín?</i>

34:43.998 --> 34:45.416
<i>To what group do you belong?</i>

34:46.042 --> 34:47.126
<i>To the Emes.</i>

34:47.210 --> 34:48.836
Sinaloa guys got them
and uploaded the video an hour ago.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.088
<i>Where were you before?</i>

34:51.464 --> 34:52.673
<i>I was in the military.</i>

34:53.841 --> 34:55.259
<i>What do you do with captives?</i>

34:56.886 --> 34:59.222
<i>We question them,</i>
<i>then we get rid of them.</i>

35:15.404 --> 35:19.450
ALTATA BAY HOTEL

35:21.285 --> 35:22.120
They're here.

35:40.847 --> 35:42.181
Your weapons, please.

36:02.160 --> 36:02.994
Joaquín!

36:30.354 --> 36:31.480
A brother for a brother, Chapo.

36:34.483 --> 36:36.027
It couldn't have been different.

36:36.611 --> 36:39.238
Now that we're even,
we must think about the Federation.

36:41.073 --> 36:42.074
You said it yourself.

36:42.617 --> 36:45.369
It's time to think with
your head, not with your feelings.

36:47.330 --> 36:48.956
Family is very important, Chapo.

36:51.334 --> 36:53.002
But you must think about business.

37:54.689 --> 37:56.148
<i>Does the boss</i>
<i>want to return to La Tuna?</i>

37:56.983 --> 37:57.817
No.

37:59.193 --> 38:00.861
Let's finish what we started.

38:01.445 --> 38:02.822
We're going to Michoacan.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.258
INCOMING CALL
FRANCO

38:45.156 --> 38:46.240
Not tonight.

40:16.205 --> 40:17.373
My name is Sebastian.

40:20.126 --> 40:21.085
Not Franco.

40:24.422 --> 40:25.881
That's my real name.

40:31.137 --> 40:32.513
I don't want you to pay me any more.

41:18.809 --> 41:21.437
Toño, it's also clear over here.

41:21.687 --> 41:22.980
What are the boss's orders?

41:23.147 --> 41:24.648
<i>"The Lord is my strength...</i>

41:26.025 --> 41:26.859
I won't tremble."

41:33.824 --> 41:36.452
-I'm sorry about your brother.
-You know why I'm here.

41:41.582 --> 41:43.626
I heard you didn't fix this with bullets.

41:44.627 --> 41:45.794
We're at war.

41:46.086 --> 41:48.172
It's better for Chente and I
to be together.

41:48.255 --> 41:49.924
It's better for you to be with us.

41:50.841 --> 41:53.886
With Chente, you controlled
one of the most dangerous demons.

41:55.596 --> 41:57.139
That's what a true leader does.

41:59.934 --> 42:02.478
Cano and the Emes are not
welcome on my land any more.

42:03.479 --> 42:04.939
I'll join your Federation.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.494
