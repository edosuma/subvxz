00:28.675 --> 00:30.050
Party Boat! Party Boat!

00:30.133 --> 00:34.342
Attention,
Lake Everett Seniors!

00:34.383 --> 00:39.050
Let's get wild! Let's get weird!
But let's not get pregnant!

00:43.967 --> 00:46.258
Party Boat! Party Boat!

00:47.758 --> 00:48.967
Come on! Ha ha!

00:50.633 --> 00:51.592
- Hey, you!
- Oh, man.

00:51.633 --> 00:53.425
Promise me
no one dies tonight!

00:53.467 --> 00:55.467
Listen. We are
five years in, my man.

00:55.550 --> 00:57.050
- Nobody's died yet.
- That we know of.

00:57.092 --> 00:58.217
If no one dies
on my last night,

00:58.258 --> 00:59.381
I'm gonna be real disappointed.

00:59.383 --> 01:00.548
You've been threatening to quit

01:00.550 --> 01:02.175
for three seasons now, Kiley.

01:02.217 --> 01:03.883
I don't think
it's gonna happen.

01:03.925 --> 01:05.548
Hey. Did you guys go
to our school?

01:05.550 --> 01:06.592
- No!
- Yes!

01:06.675 --> 01:07.717
Best friends since fifth grade.

01:07.800 --> 01:08.800
Fourth! Fourth.

01:08.842 --> 01:10.048
We are living proof

01:10.050 --> 01:12.467
that with a little bit of hustle
and some luck...

01:12.508 --> 01:13.715
And a predatory loan.

01:13.717 --> 01:16.425
All your dreams
can come true!

01:16.467 --> 01:18.967
That is the best dream ever!

01:19.008 --> 01:21.008
- It is. Aim high!
- Whoo!

01:21.050 --> 01:24.717
That's what we do, Sean!
We make dreams come true! Unh.

01:38.717 --> 01:39.925
Oh, yeah!

01:42.717 --> 01:44.050
Whoo!

01:49.717 --> 01:52.550
Three, two, one! Go!

02:02.717 --> 02:04.300
- That was pretty cool.
- That was awesome.

02:15.883 --> 02:17.758
Hey, guys! Look alive!

02:29.675 --> 02:31.050
- Get in there.
- What the hell?

02:34.300 --> 02:35.548
What, do you guys live here?

02:35.550 --> 02:37.175
Oh, yeah. Pretty cool, huh?

02:37.217 --> 02:38.675
Sad-cool, maybe?

02:38.717 --> 02:41.008
Shut up! Do you know how
much trouble we would get into

02:41.050 --> 02:43.175
if lake patrol boarded us
and found this stash?

02:43.217 --> 02:44.758
It's a lot.

02:44.800 --> 02:45.967
What kind of drugs
are those anyway?

02:46.008 --> 02:47.508
Combination Locks.

02:47.550 --> 02:48.842
What the hell is that?

02:48.883 --> 02:52.592
It's Adderall mixed with molly
mixed with acid.

02:52.633 --> 02:55.217
It's like a combo meal,
extra fries.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.883
Kinda makes
your brain just... lock.

02:57.925 --> 02:59.758
- Hmm.
- Then you're flying high!

02:59.800 --> 03:02.381
Oh, you're flying high, huh?

03:02.383 --> 03:04.383
Too bad we're gonna have to
confiscate them. Give me that!

03:04.425 --> 03:05.548
- What?
- That's right.

03:05.550 --> 03:06.758
- You heard me right!
- Get out.

03:06.842 --> 03:08.217
- No!
- Back to the party, man.

03:08.258 --> 03:09.425
Smoke some weed or something.

03:09.508 --> 03:10.842
- Those are the breaks!
- Damn!

03:10.883 --> 03:12.217
We definitely have
to take some of these.

03:12.300 --> 03:13.800
We are definitely throwing
those in the lake.

03:13.842 --> 03:15.133
- Awww.
- Immediately.

03:15.175 --> 03:16.133
- Sean.
- Max.

03:16.175 --> 03:17.467
- Sean.
- Max.

03:17.508 --> 03:18.675
- Sean.
- Max!

03:18.717 --> 03:19.717
Fine.

03:26.883 --> 03:28.175
Can't waste these.

03:30.133 --> 03:32.175
Who needs aspirin?

03:44.758 --> 03:46.717
You really want to leave
all this behind?

03:47.883 --> 03:49.381
Can't be afraid
to move on, Max.

03:49.383 --> 03:50.883
But nothing's gonna change,
right?

03:50.925 --> 03:52.592
It'll be you and me,
like always.

03:52.675 --> 03:55.675
- Always!
- First mates forever!

04:16.632 --> 04:20.216
Well, well, well.
Who is this stranger?

04:20.257 --> 04:23.092
Ah. It's my birthday bestie!

04:23.133 --> 04:24.133
What's up?

04:25.258 --> 04:26.548
Maximus!

04:26.550 --> 04:28.675
- You ready to party tonight?
- Absolutely!

04:28.717 --> 04:30.675
Hey, let me see that rage face!

04:33.550 --> 04:34.881
All right, ditch your fuzzies.
Let's go.

04:34.883 --> 04:37.050
Yeah, but I gotta clean
the boat, so...

04:38.050 --> 04:39.383
You never clean the boat.

04:41.883 --> 04:43.300
I'll be right down!

04:45.342 --> 04:47.508
Uh, did Greg get you
the final guest list?

04:47.550 --> 04:49.383
He did.
And the wine list.

04:49.425 --> 04:51.675
And the appetizer list.
And the playlist.

04:51.717 --> 04:53.092
- Yeah.
- Hey, Kev, how we lookin'?

04:53.133 --> 04:54.758
Clear skies. Calm waters.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.050
- Awesome.
- Can't lose.

04:57.842 --> 05:00.715
Anyway. Um. Sorry.
Dr. Greg loves his lists.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.217
"Dr. Greg." Don't you mean
"Orthodontist Greg"?

05:03.258 --> 05:04.800
Hey, by the way,

05:04.883 --> 05:07.092
have you ever told him that you
actually worked on this boat?

05:07.133 --> 05:08.675
I mean, he is your boyfriend.

05:08.717 --> 05:11.548
- Uh... Yes. Yes. Obviously.
- Hmm.

05:11.550 --> 05:13.592
- He doesn't know all the stories.
- Oh!

05:13.675 --> 05:14.925
Because he would run scared

05:15.008 --> 05:16.675
if he knew all the shit
I got up to with you guys.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.881
- Well, then let's call him...
- No, absolutely not!

05:18.883 --> 05:21.300
Seriously! Sailor's code, dude!

05:23.008 --> 05:24.050
All right, let's go.

05:26.050 --> 05:29.383
Cool, yeah, no, I'll just...
clean up everything, as always.

05:29.425 --> 05:30.383
Thanks, dude!

05:35.758 --> 05:37.967
Tonight, Sean.

05:38.008 --> 05:39.133
I'll have you in handcuffs.

05:40.842 --> 05:42.550
Not "soon."

05:42.592 --> 05:44.381
Tonight, Sean,

05:44.383 --> 05:47.133
and your little dog too
are going down.

05:47.217 --> 05:48.550
You know, Sean...

05:48.592 --> 05:50.050
What?

05:50.092 --> 05:52.008
What? For the love of God!

05:52.050 --> 05:53.550
Every time!

05:53.592 --> 05:55.215
- Hey, buddy!
- How's it going, Walsh?

05:55.217 --> 05:57.381
- It's all right.
- My god.

05:57.383 --> 05:59.717
This is janky.
You wanted to see me?

05:59.800 --> 06:01.048
I did. Lock that door,
would you?

06:01.050 --> 06:03.215
There's two locks. Lock both.
One's a bolt.

06:03.217 --> 06:05.050
The other one's in the
door handle right there itself.

06:05.133 --> 06:08.092
Just... we wanna be
snug as a bug... in two rugs.

06:08.133 --> 06:09.550
How long you been
on the force, Hicks?

06:09.592 --> 06:11.467
You mean lake patrol?

06:11.508 --> 06:12.883
Three days.

06:12.925 --> 06:14.717
You know, most partners
only last one week with me.

06:14.758 --> 06:17.175
- What happens to them?
- They tap out.

06:17.217 --> 06:19.133
Choke's a choke.
HR gets involved.

06:19.175 --> 06:21.383
It's, it's better to just
cut 'em loose than go to trial.

06:21.425 --> 06:24.425
What brought you, uh, to LALP?

06:24.467 --> 06:26.715
You love the lake?
Search for justice?

06:26.717 --> 06:28.050
Craigslist.

06:28.092 --> 06:30.548
Craig's a good guy.
Tell him I said hi, okay?

06:30.550 --> 06:31.717
It's a website.

06:31.758 --> 06:33.092
Do you live here?

06:33.175 --> 06:35.092
No. Live here? No.

06:35.175 --> 06:36.717
I got a big house. No.

06:36.758 --> 06:39.215
There's a bed. There's, like,
drool stains on the pillow.

06:39.217 --> 06:40.842
'Cause I was sound asleep.

06:40.883 --> 06:42.715
You take a lot of all-nighters
that you gotta pull here.

06:42.717 --> 06:44.717
A lot of surveillance work. You
could take a nap if you want.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.300
You're probably tired,
out in the sun all day.

06:46.342 --> 06:47.633
I'll lay with you
if you're frightened.

06:47.675 --> 06:48.967
- I'm good.
- Okay.

06:49.008 --> 06:51.925
Why is your pans all crusty?
You cook here?

06:51.967 --> 06:53.675
Yes, I cook.
I cook quesadillas.

06:53.717 --> 06:55.008
I cook mean quesadillas.

06:55.050 --> 06:56.633
You can have a quesadilla.
I'll cook one for ya.

06:56.675 --> 06:58.342
I'll clean the pot first.
And the pan.

06:58.383 --> 06:59.633
And then you probably
can sleep here.

06:59.675 --> 07:01.342
You can lay down and take a nap.
I'll lay with you

07:01.383 --> 07:02.675
- in case you get frightened.
- I'm good.

07:03.675 --> 07:04.758
Is that piss?

07:04.800 --> 07:06.133
You can go if you want.
It's all right.

07:06.217 --> 07:07.548
It's just two dudes.
It's all right.

07:07.550 --> 07:09.048
It's totally normal.

07:09.050 --> 07:10.925
- What's-what's that bucket for?
- That's composting.

07:10.967 --> 07:12.215
- You don't wanna go near that...
- Ugh!

07:12.217 --> 07:13.381
That's shit!

07:13.383 --> 07:14.592
You take the feces
of other animals

07:14.675 --> 07:15.715
for the benefit of a garden.

07:15.717 --> 07:17.925
You know what? Yes!
I live here. Okay?

07:18.008 --> 07:19.717
And I'm proud of it.
You know why I live here?

07:19.758 --> 07:22.050
'Cause of that white boat.
And these two assholes...

07:22.133 --> 07:24.300
Well, he's an asshole.
He's kinda handsome in a cool...

07:24.342 --> 07:26.383
They think they run the lake.
But they don't run that lake.

07:26.467 --> 07:28.175
Hicks, I run that lake.

07:28.217 --> 07:29.715
But you wanna know
what this is right here?

07:29.717 --> 07:32.342
This is my golden ticket
for that white boat.

07:32.383 --> 07:33.967
This is the Lake Council
telling me

07:34.008 --> 07:35.800
I have full authority
to bring those assholes

07:35.842 --> 07:38.550
and burn 'em
to the ground, tonight!

07:38.592 --> 07:40.883
So if you're in,
if you're down with the job,

07:40.925 --> 07:42.300
cop a squat, take a leak,

07:42.342 --> 07:43.800
drain the train,
have a quesadilla,

07:43.842 --> 07:45.508
take a nap, I'll lay
with you if you want,

07:45.550 --> 07:47.715
because tonight, we roll.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.883
Let's go buzz their tower!

07:49.925 --> 07:51.092
Okay.

07:51.133 --> 07:52.133
Hey, wait, wait!

07:52.217 --> 07:53.300
Slow down, white lightening!

07:54.550 --> 07:55.717
Wait, Kiles, hold on!

07:59.675 --> 08:01.548
- Hold on.
- Sad, Max.

08:01.550 --> 08:02.717
Yeah, I know.

08:04.342 --> 08:05.967
Oh!

08:06.008 --> 08:07.842
Oh, please, come on.

08:07.883 --> 08:10.508
It's not like Dr. Supercuts
can keep up with you either?

08:10.550 --> 08:11.967
Greg ran track at Trinity.

08:12.008 --> 08:13.425
Of course he did.

08:13.467 --> 08:14.925
Dude...

08:14.967 --> 08:16.925
I really need you guys to be
friends if this is gonna work.

08:16.967 --> 08:18.175
I need to be friends
with that guy

08:18.217 --> 08:19.758
like you need to adopt
more puppies.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.467
Don't talk smack about my pups.

08:21.508 --> 08:23.092
I'm ride or die
for those bitches.

08:26.383 --> 08:27.842
You really serious
about this whole thing?

08:29.883 --> 08:31.967
I don't know. Sometimes
it feels like I'm faking it.

08:32.049 --> 08:33.049
Running a shelter.

08:35.133 --> 08:36.548
I guess I wish
I could be back on the boat

08:36.549 --> 08:37.758
mixing drinks with you guys.

08:37.842 --> 08:40.758
Well... I know a guy
who can make that happen.

08:42.383 --> 08:45.175
But I was actually talking
about you and Greg.

08:47.717 --> 08:50.550
He is the sweetest, most
supportive guy I've ever met.

08:52.508 --> 08:55.842
I think I found someone
really special.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.383
Ah.

08:57.425 --> 08:59.508
Can you just try to be nice?

08:59.550 --> 09:01.508
Please? At least for tonight?

09:03.300 --> 09:04.342
Yeah.

09:06.050 --> 09:07.050
Fine.

09:08.467 --> 09:11.383
But... only because...

09:11.425 --> 09:13.258
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god. You're so gross.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.800
...I love you so much.

09:15.883 --> 09:17.381
Gross. Gross.
Gross. Gross. Gross.

09:17.383 --> 09:18.592
- Oh, God, get off.
- Let's go.

09:20.175 --> 09:21.842
God, you sweat
like Trump's ball sack.

09:21.883 --> 09:23.883
Well, yeah.

09:23.925 --> 09:25.258
All right. One more mile.

09:25.342 --> 09:26.883
- Okay.
- Try to keep up.

09:26.925 --> 09:28.175
You're getting slow
in your old age.

09:38.258 --> 09:41.008
You got this tonight, Sean.
This is a big party.

09:41.050 --> 09:42.925
This is one of our biggest.
What do we got?

09:42.967 --> 09:45.258
Smooth jazz, check.

09:45.300 --> 09:46.508
Pinot Grigio, check.

09:46.550 --> 09:48.675
- Officers boarding vessel.
- Mm-hmm.

09:50.550 --> 09:51.550
What do you want, Walsh?

09:55.967 --> 09:58.050
French vanilla? Creamer?
You're a pussy.

09:58.092 --> 09:59.092
Where's your partner?

09:59.133 --> 10:00.715
He's running errands.

10:00.717 --> 10:02.217
Oh, really?

10:02.258 --> 10:03.715
Ooh! Looks like
you guys are in line

10:03.717 --> 10:05.008
for another shitshow tonight.

10:05.050 --> 10:06.548
- That's nice.
- Actually, sorry to disappoint.

10:06.550 --> 10:07.592
Tonight's a classy party,

10:07.675 --> 10:09.300
hosted by
a locally respected doctor.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.842
Oh, he's an orthodontist,
actually.

10:10.883 --> 10:13.008
I don't care if it's Sean's
mom's vagina doctor.

10:13.050 --> 10:14.381
Doesn't matter.

10:14.383 --> 10:16.008
I've been waiting
for this moment for ten years.

10:16.050 --> 10:17.383
- This is my moment!
- What moment?

10:17.425 --> 10:19.592
What moment? I just got word
from the Lake Council

10:19.633 --> 10:21.092
you guys haven't paid
any of your fines.

10:21.133 --> 10:22.550
You guys are in the hole, uh...

10:22.592 --> 10:23.883
what's the number
up to now, Hicks?

10:23.925 --> 10:25.092
I think like
eighteen grand, sir.

10:25.133 --> 10:26.508
Eighteen thousand dollars.

10:26.550 --> 10:29.550
First of all... don't talk
about my mom.

10:29.592 --> 10:31.300
- Or Dr. Nancy.
- Second,

10:31.342 --> 10:33.467
we're gonna have the money.

10:33.508 --> 10:36.215
Why do you know the name
of his mom's gynecologist?

10:36.217 --> 10:37.383
You don't think that's odd?

10:37.425 --> 10:38.633
How are you gonna get the money

10:38.717 --> 10:40.633
if I ding you
with citations tonight.

10:40.717 --> 10:43.715
If you guys screw up,
and you will screw up.

10:43.717 --> 10:46.050
- Mayday, mayday, mayday.
- Not gonna happen.

10:46.092 --> 10:47.381
- Mayday!
- It's not gonna happen!

10:47.383 --> 10:48.508
- Mayday.
- Hey, guys,

10:48.550 --> 10:50.383
where should I put
these fireworks?

10:50.425 --> 10:54.967
It says it's "illegal in the
contiguous United States." Huh.

10:55.008 --> 10:56.342
Thank God we're on a lake.

10:56.383 --> 10:58.383
- Also, I opened up the tramp...
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

10:58.467 --> 11:00.008
...for...

11:00.050 --> 11:01.425
Why don't you go upstairs
for a second.

11:01.467 --> 11:03.633
I think I saw a, uh, Teletubby.

11:03.675 --> 11:05.092
Yeah, yeah, totally.

11:08.383 --> 11:10.092
This is going to be so easy.

11:14.092 --> 11:15.300
Come on, Hicks, let's go.

11:16.758 --> 11:18.133
Come on. Hicks!

11:20.717 --> 11:22.758
I freaking hate that guy.

11:22.800 --> 11:25.883
Seanie, why have we not been
paying our bills, man?

11:25.925 --> 11:27.258
Uh, it's the fines, Max.

11:27.342 --> 11:29.758
The fines that your party tricks
keep sticking us with.

11:30.842 --> 11:32.008
- Me?
- Yeah.

11:32.050 --> 11:35.133
Bobbing for lobsters.
We got a fine for it.

11:35.175 --> 11:38.050
What about the Mermaid Olympics?
Remember that? Human catapult?

11:38.133 --> 11:39.842
- That was awesome.
- No, that was awesome.

11:39.883 --> 11:41.175
That was...
that was pretty cool.

11:41.217 --> 11:43.133
Look, man, we got into
this business together

11:43.175 --> 11:44.467
as equal partners, man,

11:44.508 --> 11:46.425
and I'm doing everything I can
to keep us afloat

11:46.467 --> 11:48.258
but the fines are crushing us.

11:48.300 --> 11:50.717
Kiley's party is
the payday we need.

11:50.758 --> 11:53.633
So for one night,
I need you to help me, okay?

11:53.675 --> 11:55.133
We have to keep things low-key

11:55.175 --> 11:56.883
and we have to keep Walsh
off this boat.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.715
All right. Fine.
I got you.

11:59.717 --> 12:01.925
Hey, first mates forever.
Two times.

12:01.967 --> 12:03.881
Two times. Mm.
First mates forever.

12:03.883 --> 12:05.425
All right, cool. Checklist: Gas?

12:05.467 --> 12:07.050
Yeah. Absolutely.

12:08.342 --> 12:10.092
Man, you run out
of gas one time...

12:10.175 --> 12:12.050
- It was three...
- Three times.

12:12.092 --> 12:14.175
That's right. Uh, did you fix
the door on the lower deck?

12:14.217 --> 12:16.467
Come on, man. This is Kiley
we're talking about.

12:16.508 --> 12:18.217
You don't think
I want tonight to be perfect?

12:18.300 --> 12:22.467
I think that I'm like this close
to getting her back on the crew.

12:22.508 --> 12:26.175
It's been two years.
She's rescuing puppies now.

12:26.217 --> 12:28.300
Listen, I'm gonna say this to
you as your best friend, okay?

12:29.300 --> 12:30.383
You gotta let her go.

12:32.258 --> 12:33.675
Hey!

12:35.092 --> 12:36.467
Pick up a bag!

12:41.467 --> 12:42.633
We have to be prepared

12:42.717 --> 12:44.092
for anything when
we're out there, Hicks.

12:44.133 --> 12:46.215
Tonight...

12:46.217 --> 12:49.258
Look at this horse stance.
Look at this!

12:49.342 --> 12:51.548
Anything at all, buddy.
That's why we train.

12:54.050 --> 12:56.050
That's right, buddy.
Come on, let's train.

12:56.133 --> 12:57.467
Nah. Calm down.

12:57.508 --> 12:59.467
We're just lake patrol.
You know that.

13:00.467 --> 13:01.715
Just lake patrol?

13:01.717 --> 13:03.175
Is that what you're gonna say
when you're...

13:03.217 --> 13:04.592
when you're out
in the shit, tonight?

13:04.633 --> 13:06.133
"I'm lake patrol."
You gonna take a selfie?

13:06.175 --> 13:08.342
Put it in your wifi cloud?
Is that what you're gonna do?

13:08.383 --> 13:09.717
No.

13:09.758 --> 13:11.508
- I'll probably just tweet it.
- Suit yourself,

13:11.550 --> 13:13.467
lazy. What?

13:13.508 --> 13:14.925
No, I'm talkin'
to Hicks there, Sean.

13:14.967 --> 13:17.217
What?

13:17.258 --> 13:19.258
What was that, Sean?

13:19.300 --> 13:21.050
What was that? Hey, Max?
Wanna eat a dick?

13:21.092 --> 13:22.215
Whoa!

13:22.217 --> 13:23.758
Hey, Sean!

13:24.967 --> 13:26.800
He's tall. Sean's taller.

13:26.883 --> 13:28.258
Upwards. To the Adam's apple.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.425
He falls towards you? Little
shoe shine on the way down.

13:31.717 --> 13:33.425
Hey, Sean.

13:33.508 --> 13:35.675
Ooh! Ooh!
Elbows. Right there.

13:35.717 --> 13:36.881
Six stitches above the eye.

13:36.883 --> 13:38.633
You ever see guys
with really cool stitches?

13:38.675 --> 13:41.133
It's either hockey
or they caught one of my elbows.

13:41.175 --> 13:43.008
Right there.

13:43.050 --> 13:44.342
Why won't you just train
with me?

13:44.383 --> 13:46.425
Honestly, I mean,

13:46.467 --> 13:48.092
I feel like
you're gonna lose your shit

13:48.133 --> 13:49.133
and accidentally hurt me, so.

13:49.175 --> 13:51.467
Well, who knows? Right?

13:51.508 --> 13:52.800
I don't accidentally
lose my temper.

13:52.842 --> 13:54.592
Pain is a valuable,
valuable lesson.

13:54.633 --> 13:56.842
Maybe you could use
a lesson or two.

13:56.883 --> 13:58.217
I'll get on the boat,

13:58.258 --> 13:59.258
I'll write some tickets...

14:00.467 --> 14:03.050
but I don't wanna do that.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.717
This is good footwork.
That's mat work, man.

14:05.758 --> 14:07.258
Mat work's good for ya.

14:07.300 --> 14:09.300
Just train. That's the problem

14:09.383 --> 14:10.758
with your
entire generation, buddy.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.048
Got your faces in your phones.

14:13.050 --> 14:15.175
Palm strike. Palm strike.

14:15.217 --> 14:16.217
Box cutter!

14:17.883 --> 14:19.467
You're not gonna learn anything
on the internet.

14:23.550 --> 14:25.633
That was...

14:25.675 --> 14:27.050
Where the hell
did you learn that?

14:27.133 --> 14:28.092
The internet.

14:31.258 --> 14:33.592
You don't even know
what that's called, do ya?

14:33.633 --> 14:35.467
- Yelling?
- Can you stretch?

14:35.508 --> 14:36.675
Let's see you stretch.

14:36.717 --> 14:38.342
Why don't ya go sit down
before you get hurt?

14:38.383 --> 14:39.925
- You didn't stretch!
- A'ight.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.092
Hoo!

14:45.133 --> 14:47.467
The ancients believed that
every object had a soul.

14:47.550 --> 14:49.383
Meet your maker!

14:50.550 --> 14:51.758
Oh, that is sweet.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.342
What'd I tell you
about playing with knives?

14:53.383 --> 14:55.092
- That they're awesome?
- Didn't say that. Put it away.

14:55.175 --> 14:56.675
Oh! But I am a fruit ninja!

14:58.508 --> 15:00.883
You are a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.050
You better look alive tonight,

15:02.133 --> 15:03.633
because Kiley's gonna be
on the boat,

15:03.675 --> 15:05.715
and you are already on the verge
of being replaced, my friend.

15:05.717 --> 15:06.717
Huh? What's that?

15:07.800 --> 15:09.133
Ahoy, mateys!

15:09.175 --> 15:12.008
Oh, great, the human
mouth guard has arrived.

15:17.258 --> 15:19.550
- Keep up the good work, man.
- I shall. Always do.

15:25.633 --> 15:26.592
Hey!

15:27.592 --> 15:30.215
There they are.
The party boys.

15:30.217 --> 15:32.300
Lookin' sharp, Greg.
I like that!

15:32.383 --> 15:34.717
Thank you, good man. You know,
I went with the full seersuck

15:34.758 --> 15:36.175
- since we're on a boat.
- Yeah.

15:36.217 --> 15:39.508
- <i>♪ I'm on a boat ♪</i>
- No. No, no, no. Never.

15:39.550 --> 15:42.050
Never that song.
Never on our boat.

15:42.092 --> 15:43.508
Hey, buddy.

15:43.550 --> 15:45.967
So we feel good?
Special night, right?

15:46.008 --> 15:48.383
- Yeah.
- Yup, it is.

15:48.467 --> 15:50.050
But why are you here
an hour early, Greg?

15:50.133 --> 15:53.258
Dr. Greg is always early
for his appointments.

15:54.717 --> 15:56.633
I just wanted to make sure
all our ducks are in a row.

15:56.675 --> 15:58.258
Our ducks are in a row.
Aren't they, Sean?

15:58.300 --> 15:59.967
- They are, Max.
- As a matter of fact, Greg...

16:00.008 --> 16:01.425
We have bow ties
on all the crew.

16:01.467 --> 16:03.383
We have smooth jazz
on all the speakers

16:03.425 --> 16:04.758
and wine in every glass.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.925
Trust me, Greg,
we're all over it.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.133
- Bow ties?
- Uh-huh.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.592
- Jazz?
- Yeah.

16:09.633 --> 16:11.548
I thought Kiley wanted to have
her birthday on our boat

16:11.550 --> 16:13.715
because she likes the way
that we do things,

16:13.717 --> 16:15.217
- Sean.
- Kiley?

16:15.258 --> 16:17.842
Booking the boat was my idea.

16:17.883 --> 16:19.092
You know, for nostalgia.

16:19.175 --> 16:20.715
I just wanted to remind her
where she came from

16:20.717 --> 16:23.050
before showing her
where we're going.

16:23.092 --> 16:25.217
That's amazing.
Isn't that amazing?

16:26.342 --> 16:28.217
What does that mean?

16:28.300 --> 16:30.215
Between us...

16:30.217 --> 16:31.800
I'm gonna ask her
to marry me tonight.

16:33.383 --> 16:34.842
Whoo!

16:34.883 --> 16:36.883
You know, it feels so good
being able to say that out loud.

16:36.925 --> 16:39.133
Wow! Our first proposal.

16:39.175 --> 16:40.258
Big time.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.633
Now, I'm gonna need you
to help me out

16:41.675 --> 16:43.217
and take extra care
of my Eomma.

16:44.717 --> 16:47.133
Jesus, Greg. You look like
an asshole in that suit.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.548
Welcome aboard, Miss Kim.

16:49.550 --> 16:51.633
Uh, hope you brought
your dancing shoes.

16:51.717 --> 16:53.258
The Kims don't dance.

16:54.383 --> 16:56.881
Now, where's the bar?

16:56.883 --> 16:58.508
It's gonna be great.

17:00.425 --> 17:01.842
I like your mom, Greg.

17:14.342 --> 17:16.258
Hey. Are you serious with this?

17:16.300 --> 17:18.842
I am. And, uh,
can you hit that top button?

17:18.883 --> 17:20.800
- No!
- Yeah. Please.

17:20.842 --> 17:22.717
How you guys doing?

17:22.758 --> 17:24.008
Oh, hey, welcome!

17:24.050 --> 17:27.383
So I'm thinking,
if we wanna avoid Walsh,

17:27.425 --> 17:29.133
our best bet is
to hug the shore,

17:29.175 --> 17:31.092
anchor down in the cove.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.425
Yeah, we should be
in good shape.

17:32.467 --> 17:34.133
- You hearing me, Max?
- Were you saying something?

17:36.217 --> 17:37.592
Oh, hey! There she is.

17:37.633 --> 17:39.717
Ready to get behind that bar,
birthday girl? Two times!

17:39.758 --> 17:40.758
Unh!

17:40.842 --> 17:42.425
You guys remember
my sister, Lauren.

17:42.508 --> 17:44.925
Yeah, sorry about the divorce.
Tough break.

17:45.008 --> 17:46.883
Hmm. Screw off, Max.

17:46.925 --> 17:48.383
This boat better not sink.

17:48.467 --> 17:49.800
That's for sure.

17:49.842 --> 17:52.175
'Cause I'm paying
for the return trip too.

17:52.217 --> 17:53.883
Come on, ladies,
all aboard!

17:53.967 --> 17:55.300
Get in there!

17:55.342 --> 17:57.342
Babe,
that suit looks great.

17:57.383 --> 17:58.342
Hey, Max?

17:58.383 --> 17:59.758
Hmm?

17:59.800 --> 18:00.758
No!

18:01.758 --> 18:03.217
- Yes.
- No, no...

18:11.550 --> 18:14.050
All right. You ready?
You ready to do this?

18:14.092 --> 18:15.717
- Yeah. I'm good.
- No, you're not good.

18:15.758 --> 18:17.592
Yeah, you've got a citation
book, but you're forgetting

18:17.633 --> 18:19.383
the number one danger
out there on that lake, man.

18:21.550 --> 18:23.717
What's the matter
with you? The sun!

18:23.758 --> 18:26.425
You got... the sun, 'cause the
lake reflects all the light up.

18:26.508 --> 18:28.092
- So what's this?
- Uh...

18:29.717 --> 18:31.717
- weird pocket dildo?
- I wish!

18:31.800 --> 18:33.508
- I don't know.
- Sunscreen, buddy.

18:33.550 --> 18:35.715
You gotta get lubed up.
I can't have you burned.

18:35.717 --> 18:37.383
Your tattoos will look like
crumbled fresco.

18:37.467 --> 18:40.592
It'll look like some kinda weird
Jackson Pollock, you know? Here.

18:40.633 --> 18:41.800
- So much!
- Look up. Look up.

18:41.842 --> 18:43.800
- There you go. Now be still...
- Oh, God.

18:43.842 --> 18:45.258
- be still, don't talk.
- What are you doing?

18:45.300 --> 18:46.675
Lubin' up.

18:46.717 --> 18:49.467
Ooh. You... Yeah.
A lot of push-ups, I like that.

18:49.508 --> 18:50.925
Why are you touching
my nipple like that?

18:50.967 --> 18:52.633
I don't know, I didn't
expect it to be that long.

18:52.675 --> 18:54.925
- Sorry. Here.
- Ah! God!

18:54.967 --> 18:57.050
- What the hell?
- You gotta keep your eyes closed!

18:57.092 --> 18:58.967
You're all right.
You want a nice tan line.

18:59.092 --> 19:00.550
You got it in my eyes.

19:00.592 --> 19:02.842
Here and I'll rub that in too.
It's okay. It's okay.

19:02.883 --> 19:04.175
- Oh!
- It's okay.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.550
I think I can't see anymore.

19:08.550 --> 19:10.342
Let's go get those assholes.

19:11.383 --> 19:13.217
Okay, let's go.

19:48.675 --> 19:50.258
Look at her, man.

19:50.342 --> 19:52.217
That is her
"I'm bored as hell

19:52.258 --> 19:53.967
but I'm trying
to be polite" face.

19:54.967 --> 19:56.300
Ugh, it's pathetic.

19:56.342 --> 19:58.175
You know, Max,
it's a great thing

19:58.217 --> 19:59.675
you and Kiley are just friends

19:59.717 --> 20:01.048
and you're totally
not in love with her.

20:01.050 --> 20:03.300
Otherwise, this news
of her impending engagement

20:03.342 --> 20:05.592
would be one hell of a punch
to the nuts, huh?

20:05.633 --> 20:07.592
I'm not "totally"
in love with her.

20:07.633 --> 20:09.675
I guess the great part
about being just her friend

20:09.717 --> 20:12.258
and, as you specifically noted,
nothing more,

20:12.300 --> 20:14.800
is that you'll get to help her
choose out a wedding dress.

20:14.842 --> 20:16.425
And when she's stressed out
about the props

20:16.467 --> 20:18.633
in the photo booth
and her batshit mother-in-law,

20:18.717 --> 20:20.548
you'll get to be
her totally platonic,

20:20.550 --> 20:23.133
non-sexual shoulder to lean on.

20:23.217 --> 20:26.383
And once she's married,
you'll get to be her confidant.

20:26.425 --> 20:27.675
When she's worried that

20:27.717 --> 20:29.258
Greg is no longer interested
in her sexually...

20:29.342 --> 20:30.383
Enough!

20:35.217 --> 20:37.548
We've just never been single
at the same time,

20:37.550 --> 20:39.717
and I didn't want
to mess up our friendship.

20:41.717 --> 20:44.092
Besides, I've been waiting
for the perfect moment.

20:44.133 --> 20:46.092
You've been waiting
since fourth grade, man!

20:46.133 --> 20:47.967
Yeah, well, there's a lot
of elements that go into

20:48.008 --> 20:50.758
the perfect moment, Jonathan.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.467
Trust me,

20:52.508 --> 20:53.675
I'm the party guy.

20:55.425 --> 20:56.883
I know a thing or two
about "moments."

20:56.925 --> 20:59.217
Okay, well,
how about you make one!

20:59.258 --> 21:01.550
Okay? Before Mr. Doctor Man
wifes her up?

21:03.758 --> 21:04.717
Yeah.

21:04.758 --> 21:06.381
Yeah.

21:06.383 --> 21:07.925
You know what? You're right.

21:08.008 --> 21:09.215
But I will need your help.

21:09.217 --> 21:10.883
Sean putting us
into the cove so you...

21:10.925 --> 21:13.342
Oh, no can do, buddy.

21:13.383 --> 21:15.092
Not to be selfish,
but tonight is all about me,

21:15.175 --> 21:17.842
whoever the hell that is, and
the rest of our lives together.

21:17.883 --> 21:20.008
Don't even bother.
Lauren will swallow you whole.

21:20.050 --> 21:21.300
That's the plan.

21:23.508 --> 21:25.092
Hey, my name is Jonathan,

21:25.133 --> 21:28.008
and I'm here to help you find
your smile on this voyage.

21:28.050 --> 21:29.717
Shove that smile up your dick.

21:29.758 --> 21:31.550
My husband screwed
his life coach

21:31.592 --> 21:33.383
and left me with two kids
and no child support,

21:33.425 --> 21:35.258
so pour me a goddamned whiskey.

21:37.092 --> 21:39.133
Charming as ever, Lauren!

21:39.175 --> 21:42.050
One sadness on rocks!

21:42.092 --> 21:43.758
- The bottle, Max.
- Okay.

21:47.425 --> 21:51.175
Twenty bucks says I take her
to the township of pound.

21:52.175 --> 21:54.092
Yeah.

21:54.175 --> 21:55.715
But if I don't,
I get to keep the money.

21:55.717 --> 21:57.342
That's not how betting works.

21:57.383 --> 21:58.883
- Oh!
- I know it.

22:10.258 --> 22:11.258
Lauren?

22:14.758 --> 22:18.008
Hey. You know we're not
actually gonna sink, right?

22:18.050 --> 22:19.383
No, we're sinking.

22:19.425 --> 22:20.967
We just won't know it
until it's too late.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.300
Come on, it's not that bad.

22:25.383 --> 22:27.925
Listen to me, Kiley.
You graduate college,

22:27.967 --> 22:29.967
and everything's great.

22:30.050 --> 22:32.048
You meet a guy.

22:32.050 --> 22:35.548
And he's gorgeous
and boring and predictable

22:35.550 --> 22:38.215
and incredibly safe.

22:38.217 --> 22:41.300
And no one ever went wrong
with a nice guy, right?

22:42.800 --> 22:44.008
That's wrong.

22:44.050 --> 22:47.008
Trust me,
I know you love Greg,

22:47.050 --> 22:48.925
but don't rush into anything.

22:51.550 --> 22:53.342
Are you ready for this?

22:53.383 --> 22:55.258
Are you ready?

22:55.300 --> 22:58.175
This one is special.
I can tell.

22:58.217 --> 22:59.633
Did you see
the-the anger in her eyes?

22:59.675 --> 23:01.467
The hatred in her voice?

23:01.508 --> 23:02.675
That's so hot!

23:03.675 --> 23:04.883
She's the one, Little J.

23:06.300 --> 23:07.300
She's the one.

23:08.717 --> 23:10.967
We can't screw this up.

23:11.050 --> 23:13.550
Okay, no false starts.
No second act slumps.

23:13.592 --> 23:15.508
We need to be
on top of our game!

23:17.550 --> 23:18.550
Now, I'm not gonna lie...

23:20.592 --> 23:21.675
I'm nervous.

23:23.550 --> 23:26.133
But you can't be, okay?

23:26.175 --> 23:29.300
I need you to rise
like the sun in the east.

23:32.092 --> 23:33.800
Looking sharp, Little J.

23:35.050 --> 23:36.383
Looking sharp.

23:37.675 --> 23:38.967
Yeah.

23:48.550 --> 23:50.425
Table one, thank you.

23:52.383 --> 23:53.758
So far so good, huh?

23:53.800 --> 23:55.425
Yeah, if you like funerals
at sea.

23:55.508 --> 23:57.425
Max, don't sta...

23:57.508 --> 23:59.008
Hey, what do you guys think?

23:59.092 --> 24:00.842
Proposal at sunset
or under the stars?

24:00.883 --> 24:01.925
- Sunset.
- Stars.

24:02.925 --> 24:04.842
All right. I trust you, Max.

24:04.883 --> 24:06.633
Stars it is.

24:06.675 --> 24:08.508
Sean, on my cue,
you play that song,

24:08.550 --> 24:09.800
and I'll take care
of the rest, okay?

24:09.842 --> 24:11.048
Yes.

24:11.050 --> 24:13.050
- I'm excited.
- Yeah!

24:13.092 --> 24:15.300
I'm nervous.
Should I be nervous?

24:15.342 --> 24:17.092
- Of course...
- Yeah, have you thought this through?

24:18.092 --> 24:19.758
Did I think this through?

24:19.800 --> 24:21.092
I've been rehearsing this
for weeks.

24:22.675 --> 24:25.133
Look, look. Do-Don't worry
about a thing. Okay?

24:25.175 --> 24:26.883
Everything is set.
You're gonna do great.

24:29.133 --> 24:31.467
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah! Come on, man!

24:31.550 --> 24:32.967
Whoo!

24:35.717 --> 24:37.008
That's an all right dude.

24:38.175 --> 24:39.842
That guy's keeping TJ Maxx
in business.

24:39.883 --> 24:42.548
No, don't do that, okay?
We need to get paid, Max.

24:42.550 --> 24:44.508
And that only happens
if Greg walks away happy.

24:44.550 --> 24:47.717
And that doesn't happen
if she's having a shitty time.

24:47.800 --> 24:50.300
Look at her, man.
She's bored out of her mind!

24:51.300 --> 24:52.715
Come on.

24:52.717 --> 24:55.092
Dr. Greg can do
his thing later, okay?

24:55.133 --> 24:57.800
Right now,
what we need...

24:58.842 --> 25:00.217
- is to flip this party.
- No.

25:00.258 --> 25:02.050
No, no. What about lake patrol?

25:02.092 --> 25:03.425
You had the captain
put us in the cove.

25:03.467 --> 25:05.342
You don't think we can handle
Chuckie Walsh?

25:06.342 --> 25:08.842
Come on. Sean?

25:08.883 --> 25:12.300
All right, fine. Just promise
me nobody dies tonight.

25:12.383 --> 25:14.800
We've been doin' this
for seven years.

25:14.883 --> 25:16.050
We haven't lost
anybody yet!

25:17.050 --> 25:19.383
I'm serious, Max.

25:21.883 --> 25:23.092
Shoot.

25:24.550 --> 25:26.175
Still nothing.

25:26.217 --> 25:28.215
Still nothing?
They just pulled into the cove.

25:28.217 --> 25:29.381
That's gonna be the crime scene.

25:29.383 --> 25:31.050
You just gotta be
patient, Hicks!

25:31.133 --> 25:33.175
Why are you always
on their case, man?

25:33.217 --> 25:35.217
Because they're the reason
I'm standing here on a dinghy

25:35.258 --> 25:37.383
with a dinghy that looks
like Sammy Hagar's son

25:37.425 --> 25:40.383
instead of out there throwing
detective cock all over town.

25:40.425 --> 25:42.258
Ugh!

25:42.300 --> 25:44.800
2007, that's when it
all changed, my man.

25:44.842 --> 25:46.758
2007... I don't want these.

25:46.800 --> 25:48.508
I used to break up
their high school parties.

25:48.550 --> 25:50.633
That was me.
I was the big bad wolf.

25:50.675 --> 25:52.048
"Here comes Officer Walsh,

25:52.050 --> 25:53.383
everybody put
your cups down and run!"

25:53.425 --> 25:55.715
You should have seen
the looks on their dumb faces

25:55.717 --> 25:58.300
when I came through the woods
with my big spotlight.

25:58.383 --> 26:00.925
Then I had to stop, I didn't
feel like doin' that job anymore

26:01.008 --> 26:02.758
and it was a misunderstanding.
It's, uh, it's stupid.

26:02.842 --> 26:05.258
- Wait, I remember that night.
- No. That's impossible.

26:05.342 --> 26:06.592
You're the guy
with the big spotlight.

26:06.675 --> 26:08.300
First of all,
let's keep our voices down.

26:08.342 --> 26:09.881
Because water,
sound travels differently

26:09.883 --> 26:11.508
than it does, not water.

26:11.550 --> 26:13.883
Sean told me a young man
needed counseling.

26:13.967 --> 26:16.050
So I pulled him aside
to counsel him, okay?

26:18.050 --> 26:20.717
Okay, but why was
your pants down?

26:20.758 --> 26:21.925
We were in a restroom.

26:23.425 --> 26:25.508
Makes perfect sense.

26:25.550 --> 26:29.508
Makes perfect sense to me.
And a judge. A state judge.

26:30.842 --> 26:32.050
Give me these. You know what?

26:33.050 --> 26:34.548
Watch this.

26:34.550 --> 26:36.633
Look what I'm doing
with my eyes. Watch this.

26:36.717 --> 26:38.133
You see that?
You're not even looking at me.

26:38.217 --> 26:39.800
Look what I'm doing with my eyes.
Can you do this?

26:40.883 --> 26:42.050
I can see just as far
as those are.

26:48.217 --> 26:50.342
Hello, attention everyone,
up here.

26:50.383 --> 26:52.383
Hello, hi.

26:52.467 --> 26:54.175
My name is Max.

26:54.217 --> 26:56.048
I'm co-owner of this ship,

26:56.050 --> 26:58.215
but I also happen to be
an old friend of Kiley's.

26:58.217 --> 27:00.133
Now, as some of you know,

27:00.175 --> 27:03.967
Kiley was a founding staff
member of the S.S. Party Boat.

27:04.008 --> 27:07.217
And that first summer,
our original idea was

27:07.258 --> 27:09.800
to just park her at the dock,

27:09.842 --> 27:11.133
use her as a floating bar.

27:12.217 --> 27:14.675
But it was Kiley

27:14.717 --> 27:16.800
who stood up and told us,

27:16.883 --> 27:19.215
something that has moved this
business forward ever since.

27:19.217 --> 27:23.050
She said, "A ship is safe
in the harbor,

27:23.092 --> 27:25.092
but that's not
what ships were built for."

27:27.717 --> 27:29.258
Quickly we found out that
she got that

27:29.342 --> 27:30.717
off of a mug
at the marina giftshop.

27:32.050 --> 27:33.383
Wrap it up!

27:33.467 --> 27:39.215
But that is precisely why
we love Kiley so much.

27:39.217 --> 27:42.342
Because she knows
that pursuing adventure

27:42.383 --> 27:45.508
is much more rewarding than just
sitting safely in some harbor.

27:45.550 --> 27:48.008
And she also happens to be

27:48.050 --> 27:49.967
the best damn bartender
in all of Lake Everett.

27:50.008 --> 27:51.717
So watch your back, Jonathan!

27:52.883 --> 27:54.050
<i>So raise a glass.</i>

27:57.883 --> 27:58.883
To Kiley.

27:58.925 --> 28:00.092
To Kiley.

28:07.050 --> 28:09.258
Now, there is one more thing

28:10.717 --> 28:14.048
that Kiley Abigail Miller
will not stand for.

28:14.050 --> 28:17.717
And that is
a boring party, okay?

28:17.800 --> 28:19.508
It's time to go off
the script a bit.

28:19.550 --> 28:20.967
Off script?

28:21.008 --> 28:23.675
So put down your cellphones,
toss your inhibitions,

28:23.717 --> 28:25.008
'cause it's time to boogie!

I knew it. I knew it.
I hate them.

29:51.883 --> 29:54.758
I'm so jealous of the fun
that they have.

29:56.592 --> 29:58.675
You know what you do when you're
a real cop in a real town?

29:58.717 --> 30:00.425
You arrest people,
you put them in handcuffs.

30:00.467 --> 30:02.217
Now look at me.

30:02.258 --> 30:04.592
There's fish underneath us
right now.

30:04.633 --> 30:07.050
Fuckin' fish.
I go to work with fish.

30:08.383 --> 30:09.383
Hey, what do you bench anyway?

30:09.425 --> 30:10.842
Are you a rep guy
or a max guy?

30:15.050 --> 30:16.425
Out of my way!

30:17.425 --> 30:18.550
What the hell?

30:20.217 --> 30:22.550
Ken Doll-looking motherfucker.

30:27.967 --> 30:30.300
Ma'am? Sorry,
I just wanted to make sure

30:30.342 --> 30:31.383
you didn't need anything.

30:31.425 --> 30:32.967
It can get kind
of unsteady out there.

30:33.008 --> 30:34.592
What I need is fresh air.

30:34.633 --> 30:36.592
It's rather pungent upstairs.

30:36.633 --> 30:39.467
Like sweat mixed
with... failure.

30:39.508 --> 30:43.467
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to enjoy the view.

30:45.050 --> 30:47.383
Max! Eomma overboard!

30:47.425 --> 30:49.800
Eomma is overboard!

30:54.592 --> 30:56.342
- Oh, wow!
- Oh!

30:56.383 --> 30:58.425
When do we get to see
your boyfriend's rage face?

30:58.508 --> 30:59.675
Does he even have one?

31:00.675 --> 31:02.048
Greg's not much of a dancer.

31:02.050 --> 31:04.383
Well, I'm sure he has
plenty of other fun,

31:04.467 --> 31:07.215
youthful, carefree qualities.

31:09.342 --> 31:10.592
Save me, you mofos!

31:10.633 --> 31:12.467
Don't worry, I got you!

31:12.508 --> 31:14.717
Wait! No! Don't touch me!

31:14.758 --> 31:15.800
What?

31:15.842 --> 31:18.592
Black people can't swim!

31:18.633 --> 31:20.258
Oh! Oh, damn!

31:32.925 --> 31:34.925
We had fun though, didn't we?

31:36.217 --> 31:37.425
Always.

31:38.717 --> 31:39.717
Um...

31:39.758 --> 31:41.258
Is everything okay?
Are you sick?

31:42.717 --> 31:43.883
Uh...

31:45.175 --> 31:48.715
Kiley... ever since
we were kids,

31:48.717 --> 31:49.883
I've always wanted
to tell you...

31:49.967 --> 31:52.008
Oh, my God, Max.
Eomma's in the water.

31:52.050 --> 31:53.133
- What?
- Loo...

31:53.175 --> 31:54.300
Okay, okay, okay.

31:54.342 --> 31:55.675
Just let me say
what I was about to say...

31:55.717 --> 31:57.175
No, go! In the water!

31:59.300 --> 32:01.508
Max, go!
Give me the jacket! Just...

32:02.758 --> 32:04.217
Max! Max!

32:06.342 --> 32:07.717
Calm down.
I'm trying to help!

32:11.050 --> 32:14.258
Hey! I was finally
alone with Kiley.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.717
It was the perfect moment!

32:15.758 --> 32:17.548
What's the matter? You forget
how to save old ladies?

32:17.550 --> 32:19.215
- She's racist!
- She's not racist.

32:19.217 --> 32:21.592
She's Asian, man!
Asians can't be racist.

32:21.675 --> 32:23.175
She's just old.

32:23.217 --> 32:24.842
White devil!

32:24.883 --> 32:26.800
- White devil?
- White devil!

32:26.842 --> 32:28.633
She is racist.

32:28.675 --> 32:30.383
What the hell is going on
down there?

32:30.467 --> 32:33.008
Um, Greg's Eomma
fell overboard.

32:33.050 --> 32:34.383
Max went in to save her,

32:34.425 --> 32:36.925
but I don't know why there's
so much splashing.

32:36.967 --> 32:39.342
Because she's drowning.
Lucky bitch.

32:41.633 --> 32:44.675
Don't worry, ladies!
I got this under control!

32:44.717 --> 32:46.008
BRB.

32:50.967 --> 32:53.258
Is that guy slow or something?

32:53.300 --> 32:56.881
Uh, no. He just lives
on Planet Jonathan.

32:56.883 --> 32:58.217
It took me six weeks
to train him.

32:59.258 --> 33:01.217
Oh! Not that asshole too!

33:01.258 --> 33:03.383
Help! I'm a very poor swimmer!

33:03.425 --> 33:05.215
What are you doing out here
if you can't swim?

33:05.217 --> 33:07.008
I was trying to impress
Kiley's sister!

33:07.050 --> 33:08.508
What?

33:08.550 --> 33:09.675
Help!

33:09.717 --> 33:11.633
I'll save her.
You help this idiot.

33:11.675 --> 33:13.550
- Max! Don't let me die!
- I got you.

33:13.633 --> 33:16.175
Max! Don't let me die!

33:16.217 --> 33:19.800
I got you, just stop
poking me with your keys.

33:20.800 --> 33:22.050
What keys?

33:25.508 --> 33:27.258
Oh, my God!

33:28.717 --> 33:30.008
Nobody panic.

33:30.050 --> 33:32.050
I'm a highly trained
aquatic professional.

33:34.883 --> 33:36.883
I am not gonna let you die!

33:41.758 --> 33:44.215
I am not gonna let you die!

33:44.217 --> 33:45.215
- Oh!
- Oh!

33:48.550 --> 33:50.550
Oh, my God!
He's got a boner!

33:54.633 --> 33:57.508
Dude, I was already hard
when I started kissing her.

33:57.550 --> 33:59.383
- Kissing her?
- What the hell's going on down here?

33:59.425 --> 34:01.217
Eomma, are you okay?

34:01.258 --> 34:04.342
Oh, my God!
This shit is going viral!

34:09.092 --> 34:10.717
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

34:17.925 --> 34:19.217
You sure you're okay, Eomma?

34:19.257 --> 34:21.215
I'm fine. Stop fussing over me.

34:21.217 --> 34:22.842
Do you still have the ring?

34:26.507 --> 34:29.550
You gotta be careful with this.
I don't trust the black guy.

34:31.382 --> 34:33.967
Now, someone get me
some aspirin.

34:34.007 --> 34:36.842
My head is throbbing
like that bartender's cock.

34:37.882 --> 34:40.132
Hurry! Oh, jeez.

34:42.175 --> 34:43.425
Here you go.

34:47.882 --> 34:49.882
Uh... It's... Okay.

34:50.967 --> 34:52.092
You know what? Here.
Take two.

34:57.550 --> 34:59.133
Ooh.

34:59.217 --> 35:01.133
Dude, what were you thinking?

35:01.217 --> 35:02.381
Full mast?

35:02.383 --> 35:03.508
So soon?

35:05.217 --> 35:07.008
We don't want to scare Lauren,

35:07.050 --> 35:09.925
we wanna... woo her, all right?

35:11.467 --> 35:12.550
Don't get me wrong...

35:14.550 --> 35:16.633
it was impressive the way
you handled that cold water.

35:17.842 --> 35:19.550
You didn't back down
for a second.

35:22.050 --> 35:24.133
Look, I know
how you can get, right?

35:24.175 --> 35:25.633
You wanna...
you wanna rush in there,

35:25.675 --> 35:27.758
you wanna save the day,
we all do, be the hero.

35:30.425 --> 35:33.925
I need you to be patient...
and trust me. Okay?

35:33.967 --> 35:35.092
That's all I need.

35:37.092 --> 35:38.717
I need you
to stand down, soldier.

35:44.175 --> 35:47.342
That a boy.
That... a... boy.

35:50.342 --> 35:51.925
Bro, you told me
you fixed the railing!

35:52.008 --> 35:54.508
I did! Which railing
were you talking about?

35:54.550 --> 35:56.300
Dude, this shit is awesome!

35:56.342 --> 35:57.715
You delete that video!

35:57.717 --> 35:58.967
Freedom of the press, dude!

35:59.008 --> 36:00.133
Yeah, don't censor her.

36:00.175 --> 36:02.300
I can't believe I trusted you.

36:02.342 --> 36:03.717
A woman almost died.

36:03.758 --> 36:06.050
And you're uploading
the evidence to Instagram?

36:07.508 --> 36:09.217
Come on, Sean.

36:09.258 --> 36:11.092
Chuckie Walsh has never even
heard of Instagram.

36:15.258 --> 36:17.092
These guys are dumber
than we thought.

36:17.133 --> 36:19.425
Yeah. Only three hashtags?

36:19.467 --> 36:20.550
What losers.

36:20.592 --> 36:23.048
Total losers. What's a hashtag?

36:23.050 --> 36:24.592
- It's...
- I'm talking about the old lady

36:24.633 --> 36:26.383
almost dying.

36:26.425 --> 36:27.425
Oh.

36:28.425 --> 36:31.008
Why don't we just go in?

36:31.050 --> 36:33.008
We can't go in, because
the old lady has to be dead.

36:33.050 --> 36:34.342
Unfortunately,
she didn't die.

36:35.383 --> 36:36.717
Right.

36:39.467 --> 36:40.633
You're kidding, right?

36:41.883 --> 36:43.967
Is that a home perm?

36:44.008 --> 36:45.925
I want to get one, but I
don't think I have enough hair.

36:46.925 --> 36:48.883
All right, that's it.

36:48.925 --> 36:51.092
I'm getting this party back
under control. Give it up.

36:51.133 --> 36:52.300
Give what up?

36:52.342 --> 36:54.383
- Max.
- Sean.

36:54.425 --> 36:55.425
Max.

36:57.717 --> 36:59.092
Sean.

37:09.342 --> 37:12.715
From now on, we're sticking
to the script.

37:22.383 --> 37:24.133
It's time to call in
the big guns.

37:25.675 --> 37:27.217
What are these guys
gonna do next?

37:27.258 --> 37:28.883
Look at this!
Nobody's wearing a life-vest.

37:28.925 --> 37:30.092
That's just safety!

37:37.217 --> 37:40.592
Who among ye
be ready to die?

37:40.633 --> 37:42.715
'Cause as of this moment...

37:44.425 --> 37:47.758
...we pirates be taking over
this boat.

37:47.800 --> 37:53.217
And we be taking you
to... Fun Town!

37:53.258 --> 37:55.215
- Ha ha ha! Arrr!
- Yes! There they are!

37:55.217 --> 37:56.342
Hey, guys!

37:59.092 --> 38:00.508
Max! Water war?

38:00.550 --> 38:02.342
Water war!

38:03.550 --> 38:05.050
Two teams there be:

38:05.133 --> 38:06.967
Red the color of blood

38:07.008 --> 38:09.217
and blue the color
of the sea.

38:09.258 --> 38:11.592
The rules are simple.

38:11.633 --> 38:14.508
Only head shots count.

38:14.550 --> 38:17.925
Three headshots, and ye be out!

38:17.967 --> 38:21.258
Where ye
is shot, there ye shall fall.

38:21.300 --> 38:25.258
Last one standing be the winner!

38:25.300 --> 38:27.467
Are ye ready?

38:27.550 --> 38:29.050
Are ye set!

38:30.717 --> 38:31.715
Go!

38:31.717 --> 38:33.048
Ha ha!

38:33.050 --> 38:36.050
Fly, Carmichael, fly!

38:45.842 --> 38:47.633
You go right,
and I go left.

38:47.675 --> 38:49.092
I feel like he's right
in front of us.

38:50.300 --> 38:52.383
I know, I just wanted
to feel cool.

38:52.425 --> 38:54.342
You know, like an assassin.

38:54.383 --> 38:56.467
Aww, you're my little assassin.

39:28.717 --> 39:30.967
You guys are
on the same team!

41:35.883 --> 41:37.092
Why?

41:37.133 --> 41:39.633
Why, Little J?
Why was she immune

41:39.675 --> 41:41.300
to all of our fire power?

41:41.342 --> 41:42.925
Both barrels, both guns?

41:44.425 --> 41:46.633
The plot thickens, doesn't it?

41:46.675 --> 41:49.300
Hmmm, Lauren and I are going
to have beautiful babies.

41:50.300 --> 41:52.967
So beautiful. Ooh!
It kicked!

41:54.425 --> 41:56.592
'Cause it's a soccer ball!
Get it? It kicked it!

42:07.717 --> 42:09.300
Murder on the high seas

42:09.342 --> 42:11.508
part of one of your lists,
Greggy-boy?

42:19.092 --> 42:21.425
Oh! Save yourself!

42:22.675 --> 42:24.633
Save yourself, baby!

42:26.800 --> 42:29.550
I'll always... love you.

42:31.342 --> 42:32.342
No!

42:59.092 --> 43:02.050
Sorry, Max.
But it's my party.

43:02.092 --> 43:05.842
Just, uh, wait...
Just one second.

43:05.883 --> 43:10.258
Just... You can, but just
wait one second.

43:13.758 --> 43:15.050
Jonathan, hit it!

43:21.383 --> 43:22.550
Uh, Jonathan!

43:24.550 --> 43:26.048
Can you hit it?

43:26.050 --> 43:27.675
On it! I'll hit it!

Uhh, we peaked at 73 decibels.

44:20.300 --> 44:22.133
And the lake limit is 80.

44:22.175 --> 44:23.633
Dammit!

44:23.675 --> 44:25.633
The silky, dulcet tones
of Brian McKnight

44:25.675 --> 44:26.842
are not getting us there.

44:28.467 --> 44:30.383
Hey, uh, you don't think
you're going off the deep end

44:30.425 --> 44:32.217
a little too much there, Chuck?

44:33.675 --> 44:35.633
I have not gone
nearly deep enough.

44:38.717 --> 44:40.715
Max! Dude, yeah. Yeah.

44:40.717 --> 44:42.883
- Yeah! Yeah.
- What the hell was that?

44:42.925 --> 44:44.925
How was I supposed to know
that was their song?

44:46.508 --> 44:48.550
Oh, my goodness,
that was amazing!

44:48.592 --> 44:50.383
How'd you know that was Greg
and I's karaoke song?

44:50.425 --> 44:52.842
I didn't! I-I thought
it was our song!

44:52.883 --> 44:54.217
You remember
the eighth grade trip to D.C.

44:54.258 --> 44:55.715
We wore that song out!

44:55.717 --> 44:57.342
Brian McKnight is
Greg's spirit animal.

44:57.383 --> 44:58.967
You're the best!

44:59.008 --> 45:00.175
You're welcome!

45:02.217 --> 45:04.633
Dude, that was genius!

45:04.675 --> 45:06.925
- Oh, yeah?
- See, I thought you were going rogue with the pirates

45:06.967 --> 45:08.842
but a nostalgic watergun fight

45:08.883 --> 45:11.800
moving seamlessly
into a romantic dance moment?

45:11.842 --> 45:13.717
That's next level shit!

45:13.758 --> 45:15.217
- I like it. Keep it up.
- Sure.

45:15.258 --> 45:16.883
There's no sign of lake patrol.
You keep it up.

45:16.925 --> 45:18.425
Yeah, man, I meant to do it!

45:21.217 --> 45:24.592
Max! You were so right!
That Kiley chick is so cool!

45:24.633 --> 45:28.925
I mean, holy shit,
her drinks are awesome.

45:29.008 --> 45:30.758
She is the Nicki Minaj
to your Nickelback.

45:30.842 --> 45:32.217
Nickelback is misunderstood!

45:34.383 --> 45:36.508
And I could mix circles around Kiley.

45:36.550 --> 45:37.883
I don't know about circles.

45:39.717 --> 45:40.717
In fact...

45:41.717 --> 45:43.008
I'll bet you that you couldn't.

45:47.008 --> 45:49.508
That... was... awesome!
That was great!

45:51.258 --> 45:52.425
- That was great.
- Hey. You.

45:52.467 --> 45:54.925
It was you. All day.
Mow-wow-wow.

45:54.967 --> 45:57.383
Okay, let's get outta here.

45:57.425 --> 45:59.675
You're not going anywhere,
water scum.

46:00.675 --> 46:02.381
Say bye-bye!

46:02.383 --> 46:04.217
- Lady! That's a rental!
- That's our boat!

46:04.258 --> 46:07.092
You thought you could
take me out, didn't you?

46:07.133 --> 46:09.675
You do know
we're party pirates, right?

46:09.717 --> 46:11.508
We had a bar mitzvah
last night.

46:11.550 --> 46:14.675
My Father was
a Kuk Sool master.

46:14.717 --> 46:17.592
Hand-to-hand combat.
Up close and personal.

46:19.008 --> 46:22.300
Everything he learned,
he passed on to me.

46:22.342 --> 46:24.675
Now, back! Back off!

46:24.717 --> 46:27.092
Get in there!
Get in there!

46:27.133 --> 46:28.467
Now!

46:28.508 --> 46:29.508
Get in there!

46:30.758 --> 46:34.508
♪ Baby baby
baby baby baby ♪

46:34.550 --> 46:36.008
That's how I won the war.

46:37.758 --> 46:39.675
That's right.
Took this baby all the way

46:39.717 --> 46:41.675
to Vietnam.

46:41.717 --> 46:42.675
What?

46:45.258 --> 46:46.883
What?

46:46.925 --> 46:48.592
You wanna bang Jonathan.

46:48.633 --> 46:51.217
Supersoaker? I don't think so.

46:52.425 --> 46:54.842
Come on. That's why
I brought you here.

46:54.883 --> 46:56.925
- How long has it been?
- It's... forever.

46:57.008 --> 46:58.258
It's been forever.

46:58.342 --> 47:00.467
Yeah, exactly.

47:00.508 --> 47:03.550
♪ On my boat pourin' drinks
for ladies... ♪

47:03.633 --> 47:06.133
My ex-husband left me
for methmouth.

47:06.175 --> 47:07.300
So what?

47:07.342 --> 47:09.633
So, clearly,
having sex with me

47:09.675 --> 47:11.258
is like riding
a rusty Ferris wheel.

47:13.633 --> 47:16.383
So let him scrape off some rust
and lube you up!

47:16.425 --> 47:18.467
Excuse me, princess. But I need
to steal the guest of honor

47:18.508 --> 47:20.217
to help me settle
a bet. Okay?

47:28.092 --> 47:29.717
What the hell is he doin' now?

47:32.425 --> 47:34.675
- Are you even...
- I can't see. I don't have binoculars.

47:39.592 --> 47:42.217
Ladies and gentlemen!
Boys and girls!

47:42.300 --> 47:44.508

Who is the best
party boat bartender

47:47.883 --> 47:49.925
on all of Lake Everett?
Now here are the rules.

47:49.967 --> 47:51.383
You'll be making
three drinks...

47:52.425 --> 47:54.883
in three different rounds.

47:54.925 --> 47:56.383
The best two
out of three drinks

47:56.425 --> 47:57.842
will win
the entire competition.

47:57.883 --> 47:59.175
Too easy.

47:59.217 --> 48:01.092
- Total cakewalk.
- Who's the judge?

48:07.217 --> 48:10.925
Drink number one:
Your very best rum cocktail.

48:10.967 --> 48:12.925
Ooh!

48:12.967 --> 48:15.141
You only have one minute
for each round.

48:15.208 --> 48:16.416
Your time...

48:17.033 --> 48:18.200
starts...

48:19.908 --> 48:20.908
<i>now.</i>

48:23.942 --> 48:26.608
<i>All right, flexing is not
part of the competition. Okay?</i>

48:28.667 --> 48:30.500
All right, there she goes.

48:30.542 --> 48:32.292
Looks like she's going
for something modern

48:32.333 --> 48:33.790
and sophisticated.

48:33.792 --> 48:37.042
Meanwhile, Jonathan is just
smashing citrus fruits.

48:37.125 --> 48:38.875
Whoa! Behind the back!

48:38.958 --> 48:41.125
Nice move from Jonathan.
He actually caught it.

48:41.167 --> 48:42.790
Shake that shaker, girl!

48:42.792 --> 48:45.458
Are you ready for Kiley
or are you ready for Jonathan!

48:45.500 --> 48:47.583
Sean's taking all bets!

48:47.625 --> 48:49.125
Who do you got?
Who do you got?

48:49.208 --> 48:50.542
Something's coming together,

48:50.583 --> 48:52.375
looks like a fruity daiquiri
of some kind.

48:52.417 --> 48:53.790
All right, all right,
here we go!

48:53.792 --> 48:55.956

48:55.958 --> 48:58.208
Stop. Stop.
Back away, missy!

48:58.250 --> 48:59.583
Back away.

48:59.667 --> 49:01.417
Lauren?

49:01.458 --> 49:04.292
I call it "Girls,
We Rum the World."

49:04.333 --> 49:05.958
Yeah, ladies!

49:09.292 --> 49:11.833
Very nice.

49:14.875 --> 49:17.123
I call that the "Crooked Cock
and Hairy Balls."

49:26.000 --> 49:27.917
- <i>Okay. Yeah.</i>
- Just...

49:27.958 --> 49:29.917
Yeah. I'm just gonna call
this one. Winner!

49:29.958 --> 49:31.456
- Whoo!
- What?

49:31.458 --> 49:33.956
Go, Kiley!

49:33.958 --> 49:37.623
<i>All right, round</i> numero dos.

49:37.625 --> 49:39.833
Let's keep it easy.

49:39.875 --> 49:42.125
- <i>Shots.</i>
- You can do it, sweetie.

49:42.167 --> 49:43.875
Thanks, babe.

49:43.917 --> 49:44.875
<i>Ready?</i>

49:45.958 --> 49:46.958
Go.

49:48.417 --> 49:50.333
Oh, God, Jonathan,
what are you doing?

49:50.375 --> 49:52.042
Uh, could you pass me
that gin?

49:55.292 --> 49:57.625
That's not a health code
violation, ladies!

49:57.667 --> 49:59.292
He's been tested!

50:02.375 --> 50:05.417
That's a health code
violation!

50:05.458 --> 50:07.123
All right, looks like
they're almost done.

50:07.125 --> 50:08.958
Who likes shots?
You like shots?

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
You like shots.
You like shots. You like shots.

50:11.083 --> 50:13.123
You get a shot.
And you get a shot.

50:13.125 --> 50:14.456
And you get a shot.

50:14.458 --> 50:16.375
All right,
Kiley's just finishing up.

50:16.417 --> 50:18.583
Here comes... It's getting
right down to the wire.

50:18.625 --> 50:20.542
Jonathan better hurry up.

50:20.583 --> 50:23.833
<i>Five, four, three...</i>

50:23.875 --> 50:25.833
two, one, time!
Time. Time. Time.

50:28.167 --> 50:29.583
Whoo!

50:29.625 --> 50:30.750
Shots.

50:31.750 --> 50:33.417
This is a "Dirty Harry."

50:33.458 --> 50:35.750
Do you feel lucky? Bitch?

50:44.958 --> 50:47.792
Uh, it's definitely dirty.

50:50.625 --> 50:51.790
All right, well,

50:51.792 --> 50:54.542
in honor of my Dr. Greg,

50:54.583 --> 50:57.625
who's thrown such
a wonderful party,

50:57.708 --> 50:59.125
please enjoy
some "Novocaine."

51:06.833 --> 51:07.792
What?

51:08.792 --> 51:09.917
Impossible.

51:11.292 --> 51:13.542
Mmm. Oh, God, gross.

51:13.583 --> 51:16.667
Greg, I told you
to give me gin, not vodka.

51:16.708 --> 51:17.958
I-I'm sorry.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.790
Never trust an orthodontist!

51:19.792 --> 51:21.667
Jonathan takes round two.

51:21.708 --> 51:25.958
And now, for the final
and most important round.

51:28.833 --> 51:30.458
Bartender's choice.

51:30.500 --> 51:32.333
You have one minute...

51:32.417 --> 51:33.958
to prepare...

51:34.000 --> 51:35.583
any drink you want.

51:35.625 --> 51:38.623
And the clock... starts now.

51:40.958 --> 51:43.417
<i>It all comes down
to this, party people!</i>

51:43.458 --> 51:45.583
The master versus the moron!

51:45.625 --> 51:47.500
Will Kiley keep her title?

51:47.542 --> 51:50.792
Will Jonathan remember
to keep his shorts on?

51:50.833 --> 51:52.208
It's anybody's game!

51:53.958 --> 51:55.958
Oh, oh, he's walking away!
He's walking away!

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
Oh! He's comin back!
Here he comes!

51:59.167 --> 52:01.208
Oh, he's got nothing on her!

52:01.292 --> 52:03.542
Three, two, one!

52:03.625 --> 52:06.042
Hands up. Drinks down.

52:06.125 --> 52:07.333
All right.

52:07.375 --> 52:10.623
This, I call
a "Quarter-Life Crisis."

52:10.625 --> 52:12.958
Something we all know
a thing or two about.

52:15.958 --> 52:18.125
Oh, shit. That's good, girl.

52:19.583 --> 52:21.456
Uh-huh, whatever.

52:21.458 --> 52:22.917
Who needs good
when you have...

52:24.375 --> 52:26.042
the "Dwayne Johnson."

52:26.083 --> 52:28.000
Strong as hell, but everybody
thinks it's over-rated.

52:28.042 --> 52:29.167
But they're wrong.

52:34.250 --> 52:35.417
<i>Survey says...</i>

52:37.667 --> 52:39.542
Oh, yes, there you went!

52:39.583 --> 52:42.042
Ba-ba-ba-ba. Ba-ba-ba-ba.

52:42.125 --> 52:45.375
That means that
the winner and still

52:45.458 --> 52:49.167
reigning champion
of the Lake Everett

52:49.208 --> 52:53.500

extravaganza is...

52:55.958 --> 52:58.083
The Kileynator! Yeah!

52:58.125 --> 53:00.375
Are you kidding me? Max!

53:00.417 --> 53:02.625
- Yes! Yes!
- <i>Whoo!</i>

53:02.708 --> 53:05.123
- Whoo!
- Wow!

53:05.125 --> 53:08.125
- Dude, that was so much fun.
- Mm.

53:08.167 --> 53:11.083
So... what do I win?

53:11.125 --> 53:14.083
Oh. Well, I do have
one more surprise for you.

53:14.125 --> 53:15.667
- Follow me.
- Of course you do.

53:17.167 --> 53:19.042
I'll be right back, babe.

53:19.083 --> 53:20.167
Let's go.

53:20.208 --> 53:21.542
That was amazing. Whoo!

53:21.583 --> 53:23.500
That was good.

53:23.542 --> 53:26.333
She's still got it.

53:28.333 --> 53:30.000
I think I need to move
this proposal up.

53:31.333 --> 53:32.958
- Sure thing. When?
- To now.

53:34.583 --> 53:37.167
- Okay, uh, I just need to cue up a few...
- No, no, no, sorry.

53:37.250 --> 53:38.583
Let me put this another way.

53:38.625 --> 53:40.083
If you don't get Max
under control

53:40.125 --> 53:42.208
and you don't pull this proposal
off without a hitch,

53:42.250 --> 53:43.958
I'm not paying for any of this.
You understand?

53:47.625 --> 53:48.667
Yeah.

53:48.708 --> 53:51.083
- This way, right this way.
- What are...

53:51.125 --> 53:53.875
My birthday surprise is a trip
to the storage room?

53:53.917 --> 53:56.083
Not exactly, I gotta find it.
Just, uh...

53:56.125 --> 53:58.125
Oh, my God,

53:58.167 --> 53:59.665
you still have this old thing?

53:59.667 --> 54:02.292
Oh, yeah.
I love this hoodie!

54:02.333 --> 54:04.167
Whatever happened
to my red hoodie?

54:04.208 --> 54:07.667
Currently, it is being worn by
a mechanical large-mouthed bass

54:07.708 --> 54:09.167
- at the bottom of the lake.
- Oh.

54:09.208 --> 54:11.792
Now I'm jealous
of a cozy, singing fish.

54:12.833 --> 54:14.583
- Spotlight good?
- Sean,

54:14.625 --> 54:15.917
I can't find Kiley anywhere.

54:15.958 --> 54:17.625
Hey, everything is all good.
I got it set.

54:17.667 --> 54:19.500
- We're ready to go...
- No. I need to find her now.

54:19.583 --> 54:21.125
- Let's go.
- Okay.

54:22.458 --> 54:24.417
Whoa!

54:24.458 --> 54:25.750
Do you remember this?

54:26.958 --> 54:28.375
Diver Dan.

54:28.417 --> 54:29.917
Came out of retirement
at his own party

54:29.958 --> 54:31.917
to jump in the lake
and save that entire family.

54:31.958 --> 54:33.667
- Oh, what a legend.
- Yeah.

54:41.042 --> 54:42.417
Hey.

54:42.458 --> 54:44.583
The nurses!
The spring fling, right?

54:44.625 --> 54:45.667
Yeah! By the end
of the night,

54:45.708 --> 54:47.125
they were giving
each other IV drips.

54:47.167 --> 54:49.542
That's not all they were giving each other.

54:49.625 --> 54:51.708
Ah-hah! I found it!

54:51.792 --> 54:53.458
What?

54:53.500 --> 54:54.458
This.

54:55.458 --> 54:56.458
What is this?

54:57.625 --> 55:01.290
This is the flower
that I gave you

55:01.292 --> 55:04.123
the night of your last party
ever on the boat.

55:04.125 --> 55:05.956
Senior's last dance!

55:05.958 --> 55:08.583
- Yes! Yeah.
- I remember you gave it to me at the bar!

55:08.625 --> 55:10.125
Yeah.

55:10.208 --> 55:11.458
Why do you still have this?

55:11.542 --> 55:13.458
Just needed a memento.

55:13.500 --> 55:15.875
Of a high school
graduation party?

55:15.917 --> 55:19.500
Of the night... that I knew...

55:19.542 --> 55:21.500
That you knew what?

55:21.542 --> 55:23.750
That I knew that...

55:23.792 --> 55:25.958
There you are.
I've been looking for you!

55:26.000 --> 55:29.292
Uh, Max was helping me find
my bartending prize.

55:29.333 --> 55:31.958
Yep! And we're still looking
for it so...

55:32.000 --> 55:33.292
Could you come back
to the deck, baby?

55:33.333 --> 55:34.790
There's something
I wanna show you.

55:34.792 --> 55:37.167
- More surprises!
- Well...

55:37.250 --> 55:38.917
it's a surprise in that
it's something

55:38.958 --> 55:41.167
I've meticulously planned
for months,

55:41.250 --> 55:42.750
preparing for every contingency,

55:42.792 --> 55:44.956
leaving no room
for unplanned results.

55:44.958 --> 55:47.208
- So, yeah! Sure!
- Cool.

55:53.875 --> 55:56.583
- Get out of my way.
- I can't have you messing up the program.

55:56.625 --> 55:58.417
And I can't have Kiley marrying
that jackass.

55:58.458 --> 55:59.875
I know you love her.

55:59.917 --> 56:01.917
I know you've loved her
since forever,

56:01.958 --> 56:03.708
but stopping him from what
he's about to do right now

56:03.750 --> 56:04.833
is not the right move, man.

56:04.875 --> 56:06.208
Oh, what.

56:06.250 --> 56:07.625
It's all about money,
I'm assuming, huh?

56:07.667 --> 56:09.208
Oh, you mean that thing
we have none of

56:09.250 --> 56:10.708
because every time
we leave the marina,

56:10.792 --> 56:11.875
you find a way
to get us fined.

56:11.958 --> 56:13.958
Money is your thing!

56:14.000 --> 56:15.333
So you deal with it.

56:20.292 --> 56:22.083
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

56:22.125 --> 56:24.333
Sean! Come on!
What are you doing?

56:24.417 --> 56:25.500
I'm dealing with it!

56:25.583 --> 56:27.125
First mates forever?

56:34.458 --> 56:35.583
I'm sorry.

56:36.875 --> 56:39.542
I screwed everything up.
I thought my,

56:39.583 --> 56:41.792
my bartending prowess
could get the job done.

56:44.375 --> 56:45.917
I needed your energy up there.

56:47.250 --> 56:48.417
Your spark.

56:50.042 --> 56:51.542
Okay,

56:51.583 --> 56:53.790
let's keep it
together, man, okay?

56:53.792 --> 56:56.456
If we dig deep
and work as a team,

56:56.458 --> 56:58.708
we can find a way
to get Lauren's heart racing.

57:01.792 --> 57:02.958
I have an idea.

57:04.083 --> 57:05.125
Follow me.

57:09.625 --> 57:11.417
Tough loss.

57:11.458 --> 57:13.458
Mmm, I threw it on purpose.

57:14.625 --> 57:16.292
Made a bet with Max
that I'd win.

57:19.458 --> 57:20.875
Mm.

57:20.917 --> 57:23.583
Come on.
I want to show you something.

57:25.000 --> 57:26.083
Okay.

57:28.250 --> 57:30.750
In Korea, this is called
<i>jug-eum-ui chum...</i>

57:32.500 --> 57:33.956
the Dance of Death.

57:33.958 --> 57:36.958
Throughout his entire life,
my father was undefeated

57:37.000 --> 57:39.458
and tonight,
I will continue his legacy.

57:42.583 --> 57:46.417
Aaaaaah!

57:47.917 --> 57:49.125
Now you.

57:51.583 --> 57:53.623
Stupid slow finger.

57:53.625 --> 57:56.250
Man, this is the bullshit
I'm talking about.

58:00.333 --> 58:05.375
♪ A tisket a tasket
a green and yellow basket ♪

58:05.417 --> 58:06.958
Pathetic!

58:07.000 --> 58:09.833
Father, guide my hand.

58:23.375 --> 58:25.125
- Who is the victor?
- Eomma!

58:25.167 --> 58:26.458

58:32.292 --> 58:33.456
Oh!

58:33.458 --> 58:35.456

58:38.292 --> 58:40.500
<i>Can I get everybody up
on the main deck please.</i>

58:45.042 --> 58:47.792
- You're going through some heavy stuff right now, aren't you?
- Yes.

58:47.833 --> 58:50.708
- Divorce. Heartbreak. Self-loathing.
- Yes.

58:50.750 --> 58:53.333
- Mmm. Colors are muted, food has no taste.
- Yes!

58:53.375 --> 58:54.875
What do you need, Lauren?

58:54.917 --> 58:55.958
I need...

58:56.000 --> 58:57.333
What do you need?

58:57.375 --> 58:59.125
I need...

59:00.667 --> 59:03.875
- that Dwayne Johnson.
- Hmm.

59:03.958 --> 59:06.417
Testing. Testing.
Testing, one, two, three.

59:07.500 --> 59:09.083

Y-O-U.

59:17.250 --> 59:18.417
Lights!

59:22.917 --> 59:25.458
Good evening, everybody.

59:25.500 --> 59:28.458
I'm up here because I have
something very important to say.

59:28.500 --> 59:29.458
So here goes.

59:32.750 --> 59:34.208
Oh! Ah!

59:36.875 --> 59:38.790
Okay, okay.

59:38.792 --> 59:40.000
Kiley...

59:42.625 --> 59:44.500
you are the center
of my universe.

59:45.542 --> 59:46.708
You're the light...

59:47.917 --> 59:49.792
that illuminates my life.

59:52.833 --> 59:56.792
Well, it's a good thing
I am one negligent bastard.

01:00:08.417 --> 01:00:09.625
Oh, yeah.

01:00:15.625 --> 01:00:17.750
What the hell is he doing?

01:00:17.792 --> 01:00:19.792
I remember the first day
that we met.

01:00:21.375 --> 01:00:23.958
I saw you from across the room.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.625
You threw your head back,
and you started to laugh.

01:00:28.667 --> 01:00:31.290
It was the most beautiful smile
I've ever seen.

01:00:31.292 --> 01:00:33.625
- Aww.
- Aww.

01:00:33.667 --> 01:00:35.250
I knew from that instant
that my life

01:00:35.292 --> 01:00:36.583
would never be the same.

01:00:39.208 --> 01:00:40.208
But here's the thing:

01:00:41.292 --> 01:00:42.458
If you all know Kiley,

01:00:42.542 --> 01:00:43.917
you know what
her favorite show is, right?

01:00:43.958 --> 01:00:45.123
<i>So You Think You Can Dance!</i>

01:00:45.125 --> 01:00:46.542
So You Think You Can Dance!

01:00:46.583 --> 01:00:50.042
- Okay. All right.
- Come on! Come on.

01:00:50.083 --> 01:00:51.500
She never misses an episode,

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.167
which means,

01:00:54.208 --> 01:00:56.458
for better or worse,
I never miss an episode.

01:00:58.458 --> 01:01:01.250
So a few months back...

01:01:01.292 --> 01:01:03.792
I was thinking how can I make
tonight extra special.

01:01:05.167 --> 01:01:06.623
- <i>And so...</i>
- No.

01:01:06.625 --> 01:01:08.375
- <i>Yes!</i>
- No. Really?

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:12.792

join us on the dance floor?

01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:47.083
Greg, You need to go
to a hospital.

01:03:47.125 --> 01:03:51.667

to be on the mark!

01:04:03.917 --> 01:04:04.958
will you marry me?

01:04:06.208 --> 01:04:07.208
Please?

01:04:08.208 --> 01:04:09.250
Will you marry me?

01:04:12.917 --> 01:04:15.208
I...

01:04:16.375 --> 01:04:17.708
I'm sorry.

01:04:21.417 --> 01:04:22.750
I'm sorry.

01:04:40.792 --> 01:04:43.125
Hey! Oh, you okay?

01:04:43.167 --> 01:04:45.125
- What the hell was that?
- W-W...

01:04:45.167 --> 01:04:47.083
You just threw a buoy
at my boyfriend!

01:04:47.125 --> 01:04:49.790
First of all, it's not called
a buoy, it's called a fender.

01:04:49.792 --> 01:04:53.375
But what the hell
was that though? Right?

01:04:53.417 --> 01:04:54.917
I just thought
it was a birthday dance.

01:04:54.958 --> 01:04:57.000
I had no idea
he was gonna propose.

01:04:57.042 --> 01:04:59.125
Well, it's okay.
You did the right thing.

01:04:59.167 --> 01:05:01.208
I just need time... to think.

01:05:03.542 --> 01:05:05.625
It's weird being back
on this boat with you and Sean.

01:05:05.667 --> 01:05:08.500
Good weird though... right?

01:05:08.542 --> 01:05:09.583
I don't know.

01:05:10.625 --> 01:05:12.500
I guess. Yeah.

01:05:15.708 --> 01:05:19.875
So... my whole life I've had
this idea of the perfect moment.

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:24.417
But now, I think that maybe,

01:05:24.458 --> 01:05:26.667
you know, sometimes you just
got to take a leap of faith.

01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:28.625
- So...
- So I should marry Greg?

01:05:28.667 --> 01:05:30.583
No, I mean that I need
to take a leap of faith.

01:05:32.417 --> 01:05:33.583
Because I love you.

01:05:35.792 --> 01:05:37.667
Yeah, I love you too.

01:05:37.708 --> 01:05:42.250
No, I mean...
I'm in love with you.

01:05:46.125 --> 01:05:47.458
Shit!

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:50.000
I know.

01:05:52.625 --> 01:05:54.042
You know,
you could not have picked

01:05:54.125 --> 01:05:55.875
a shittier time
to dump this on me.

01:05:55.958 --> 01:05:57.790
Oh, hey. Hey, hey, hey,
come on.

01:05:57.792 --> 01:06:00.290
It could be you and me.
Like it always was.

01:06:00.292 --> 01:06:03.000
Just having fun.
Living in the moment,

01:06:03.083 --> 01:06:05.290
partying on the boat
all the time.

01:06:05.292 --> 01:06:08.250
It's just that now,
there would be...

01:06:08.292 --> 01:06:09.750
a little kissing thrown in.

01:06:12.708 --> 01:06:14.042
Come on, Max.

01:06:17.292 --> 01:06:18.542
That was...

01:06:19.667 --> 01:06:22.583
Yeah! It really was.

01:06:22.625 --> 01:06:24.792
I only hit my head
like a thousand times.

01:06:24.833 --> 01:06:26.208
I only pulled my groin twice!

01:06:31.583 --> 01:06:32.917
You wanna know something?

01:06:32.958 --> 01:06:34.125
What?

01:06:35.292 --> 01:06:38.208
I knew from the second
I saw you

01:06:38.292 --> 01:06:42.167
that we had the most...
amazing connection.

01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:46.458
- Shut up.
- No, I'm serious.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.500
You wanna know
how serious I am?

01:06:48.583 --> 01:06:50.125
When I saw Max,

01:06:50.167 --> 01:06:53.292
I bet him twenty bucks
we'd get together.

01:06:55.125 --> 01:06:56.583
- What?
- Yeah.

01:06:56.625 --> 01:06:59.250
Which is something we do,
uh, but normally, I don't win,

01:06:59.292 --> 01:07:01.458
or I do win,
but I can never provide proof.

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.125
I can't believe this.

01:07:04.167 --> 01:07:06.917
No, no, no. I-I'm saying
I-I normally lose the bet,

01:07:06.958 --> 01:07:08.208
b-but I saw my soulmate

01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:09.792
and when you have a soulmate,
you can't lose!

01:07:09.833 --> 01:07:12.083
I'm making this worse, aren't I?

01:07:12.125 --> 01:07:13.375
Actually...

01:07:15.167 --> 01:07:17.333
no.

01:07:17.375 --> 01:07:19.458
I've never been
the subject of a sex bet.

01:07:22.375 --> 01:07:23.958
It feels awesome.

01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:33.623
I don't want you to worry
about a thing, Greg.

01:07:33.625 --> 01:07:35.750
I'm gonna get us back
to the marina. Okay?

01:07:35.792 --> 01:07:37.625
What's the point?

01:07:37.708 --> 01:07:39.042
Just throw me overboard.

01:07:39.083 --> 01:07:41.542
- Hey, Sean...
- No... I need you to take this

01:07:41.583 --> 01:07:43.500
and, uh, get some ice
for Dr. Kim's leg. Okay?

01:07:43.542 --> 01:07:44.792
- But, Sean...
- Why aren't we moving?

01:07:44.833 --> 01:07:46.125
That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

01:07:46.167 --> 01:07:47.792
I think we ran out of gas.

01:07:47.833 --> 01:07:49.583
- What?
- Did he just say we're out...

01:07:49.625 --> 01:07:51.083
Go get the ice.

01:07:51.125 --> 01:07:53.167
Um, look, you relax this leg.

01:07:53.208 --> 01:07:55.500
Excuse me for one second.
I'll be right back.

01:07:55.542 --> 01:07:56.792
Are we stranded?

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:14.667
Eomma? Are you okay?

01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:17.792
I-I lost the Dance of Death

01:08:17.875 --> 01:08:22.792
and was defeated in battle
by a pasty manchild.

01:08:22.875 --> 01:08:26.250
My father is looking down
on me with shame.

01:08:26.292 --> 01:08:29.792
Hey, you can't let
his approval run your life.

01:08:32.207 --> 01:08:33.167
Look...

01:08:34.167 --> 01:08:35.167
Eight years ago...

01:08:36.332 --> 01:08:38.082
I told my father
that I like women,

01:08:38.125 --> 01:08:41.292
and he totally freaked out.

01:08:41.332 --> 01:08:44.125
And then fortunately, I haven't
spoken to him since.

01:08:44.167 --> 01:08:47.542
But that's on him and not me.

01:08:48.625 --> 01:08:49.582
Understand?

01:08:51.292 --> 01:08:52.750
I think I do.

01:08:52.792 --> 01:08:53.832
Thank you.

01:08:55.667 --> 01:08:57.622
You're welcome.

01:08:57.625 --> 01:08:59.417
Can I help you...

01:08:59.457 --> 01:09:00.625
get out of this?

01:09:07.707 --> 01:09:09.457
Hey! There you are!

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.292
Guess what?
I finally told... Whoa!

01:09:11.332 --> 01:09:13.167
- Hey! What is...
- Come on.

01:09:13.207 --> 01:09:14.667
Hey, What's up?

01:09:14.707 --> 01:09:15.917
You said you filled the gas!

01:09:15.957 --> 01:09:18.167
Ha! I say a lot of things.

01:09:18.207 --> 01:09:19.667
We're stranded out here.

01:09:19.707 --> 01:09:22.292
And if I call lake patrol,
we're totally screwed.

01:09:22.332 --> 01:09:24.000
Lake patrol, really?

01:09:24.042 --> 01:09:25.207
You're still afraid
of those guys?

01:09:25.292 --> 01:09:26.832
You've been letting Walsh
push you around

01:09:26.875 --> 01:09:28.956
- ever since high school.
- They're not pushing me around, Max!

01:09:28.957 --> 01:09:30.792
They're trying to kick us
off this lake!

01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:33.417
That's our business.
The one that you have again

01:09:33.457 --> 01:09:34.792
put yourself ahead of.

01:09:34.832 --> 01:09:36.457
You've compromised everything
we ever worked for.

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:38.750
- We can find more money.
- No, we can't! There's no more money!

01:09:38.792 --> 01:09:40.707
- Have I ever let you down before?
- Yes!

01:09:40.750 --> 01:09:41.917
Fair enough!

01:09:43.707 --> 01:09:46.207
There is no way that Greg
is gonna pay for this party

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:47.625
after you just ruined
his proposal.

01:09:50.792 --> 01:09:51.875
You know what?

01:09:53.707 --> 01:09:54.875
We're done.

01:09:56.542 --> 01:09:58.417
What, you don't want
to be partners anymore?

01:10:00.042 --> 01:10:01.625
I don't know if I even want
to be your friend.

01:10:11.042 --> 01:10:12.042
Oh!

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.167
You hear that?

01:10:19.958 --> 01:10:21.292
Wait, what the hell is that.

01:10:22.417 --> 01:10:24.458
Is Greg about to jump?

01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:31.042
Greg, what the hell
are you doing?

01:10:31.083 --> 01:10:32.917
Leave me alone, Max!

01:10:32.958 --> 01:10:35.750
And there it is.
Someone's finally going to die.

01:10:35.792 --> 01:10:37.667
Just... go get Kiley.

01:10:45.125 --> 01:10:46.292
Greg?

01:10:48.875 --> 01:10:50.623
Why don't you just come back
to the party, man?

01:10:50.625 --> 01:10:54.000
You know? Show us some more
of those cool dance moves.

01:10:55.792 --> 01:10:57.292
I think I broke my ankle.

01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:00.458
Yeah, um...

01:11:01.792 --> 01:11:04.123
Listen, man, about that.
I'm really sorry. Okay?

01:11:04.125 --> 01:11:07.208
I just... I got really...
carried away.

01:11:09.292 --> 01:11:10.625
Yeah, so did I.

01:11:12.417 --> 01:11:13.958
I don't know
what I was thinking.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.542
Well, you were thinking about
sweeping her off her feet, man.

01:11:18.583 --> 01:11:21.167
It's a poor choice of words.
I'm sorry. I...

01:11:21.208 --> 01:11:22.542
Hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait!

01:11:23.958 --> 01:11:25.292
Hey. Uh. Yeah.
Quick question.

01:11:25.333 --> 01:11:26.708
Why aren't we movin'?

01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:28.542
I was actually just reading
some of your Yelp reviews,

01:11:28.625 --> 01:11:29.875
and apparently
you guys are pretty...

01:11:29.958 --> 01:11:31.625
- Kiley?
- ...well known for running out of gas.

01:11:31.667 --> 01:11:33.542
Kiley? Kiley?

01:11:33.625 --> 01:11:35.500
Yeah. Okay. Good talk.

01:11:35.542 --> 01:11:36.792
- Whats up?
- Greg's up front,

01:11:36.833 --> 01:11:38.250
- says he's gonna jump.
- Shit!

01:11:38.292 --> 01:11:39.458
Greg doesn't know how to swim.

01:11:40.667 --> 01:11:42.000
I'm telling everyone

01:11:42.083 --> 01:11:44.125
you guys are irresponsible
and incompetent.

01:11:44.167 --> 01:11:45.625
Yeah, why haven't you called
for help?

01:11:47.625 --> 01:11:49.958
Fine, you know what?
What's the point.

01:11:50.042 --> 01:11:51.875
Everyone hold tight
while I call lake patrol.

01:11:55.542 --> 01:11:58.083
Greg. Greg, what are you doing?

01:11:59.667 --> 01:12:03.625
I'm sorry, I couldn't say... yes
to your proposal

01:12:03.667 --> 01:12:05.583
in front of all those people.

01:12:05.625 --> 01:12:07.292
You were never going
to say yes.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.792
I clean teeth,
and I wear seersucker.

01:12:11.833 --> 01:12:13.625
Yeah, but you were
rockin' it, man!

01:12:23.292 --> 01:12:26.750
Lake patrol, this is
S.S. Party Boat. Come in, over.

01:12:26.792 --> 01:12:28.542
Well, well, well. Let me guess,

01:12:28.583 --> 01:12:31.458
that menace of a ship of yours
ran out of gas,

01:12:31.542 --> 01:12:32.956
you've got a passenger
that's about

01:12:32.958 --> 01:12:34.958
to commit harakari
off the bow,

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.458
and you're on this radio
to beg for mercy.

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:38.667
Well, guess what?

01:12:38.708 --> 01:12:41.417
You're not getting
any mercy, Meadows.

01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:43.625
No. Say the word.

01:12:43.667 --> 01:12:45.750
I want to hear you say
the word,

01:12:45.792 --> 01:12:49.625
and we can call this off
once and for all.

01:12:49.667 --> 01:12:50.833
Over.

01:12:53.833 --> 01:12:55.667
I just wanted to say that

01:12:55.708 --> 01:12:58.790
your people have
the most beautiful skin.

01:12:58.792 --> 01:13:04.292
And you are a wonderful,
wonderful swimmer.

01:13:05.792 --> 01:13:07.292
Uhh, you okay?

01:13:08.458 --> 01:13:09.958
Flyin' high.

01:13:24.375 --> 01:13:25.375
Mayday.

01:13:25.417 --> 01:13:26.500
Greg.

01:13:27.542 --> 01:13:28.583
Baby, just come down.

01:13:28.625 --> 01:13:31.625
Okay? We'll go to shore.

01:13:31.667 --> 01:13:34.625
We'll get your leg fixed,
and we will talk about this.

01:13:34.667 --> 01:13:36.667
You know, I always thought

01:13:36.708 --> 01:13:39.333
Max didn't like me
because I'm an orthodontist.

01:13:39.375 --> 01:13:42.917
Tonight I realized it didn't
have anything to do with me.

01:13:44.167 --> 01:13:46.917
It was always about you.

01:13:46.958 --> 01:13:49.708
I'm allergic to dogs,
and I clean retainers.

01:13:51.625 --> 01:13:52.792
I thought I could dance, but...

01:13:54.542 --> 01:13:55.583
Now I know.

01:13:55.625 --> 01:13:57.417
Oh, what's the point.

01:13:57.458 --> 01:13:58.958
- Whoa, whoa! Hey!
- Whoa! Hey, man!

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.750
Hey! Greg, We got you

01:14:00.792 --> 01:14:03.875
a lifetime supply
of Allegra at Costco.

01:14:04.958 --> 01:14:08.375
You make
people's smiles straighter.

01:14:08.417 --> 01:14:10.667
Without you, I would have
never opened the shelter.

01:14:10.708 --> 01:14:13.375
You force me to believe
in myself.

01:14:17.458 --> 01:14:18.458
Greg...

01:14:19.542 --> 01:14:20.708
it's Max again.

01:14:22.292 --> 01:14:25.625
Uhm, I've known Kiley
since fourth grade

01:14:25.667 --> 01:14:29.125
and you've known her,
what, two years?

01:14:29.167 --> 01:14:31.208
So, that kind of makes you
a Kiley novice.

01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:34.290
- Shut up, Max!
- No, no, no, I-I got this.

01:14:34.292 --> 01:14:35.458
Trust me.

01:14:38.542 --> 01:14:41.000
Greg, listen to me,
you two left-footed

01:14:41.042 --> 01:14:42.125
son of a bitch.

01:14:42.167 --> 01:14:44.125
She loves you.

01:14:44.167 --> 01:14:45.583
No, she doesn't.

01:14:45.625 --> 01:14:46.708
Yes, she does.

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:49.083
Just tell him.

01:14:50.458 --> 01:14:51.625
Come on, Kiley.

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:55.000
Just take the plunge.

01:14:55.042 --> 01:14:57.500
Oh, no, no, no, no. Not...

01:14:58.958 --> 01:14:59.958
Not you!

01:15:01.833 --> 01:15:03.708
Jesus, this guy's so literal.

01:15:03.792 --> 01:15:05.623
Hey,

01:15:05.625 --> 01:15:06.958
you know what you have to do.

01:15:08.792 --> 01:15:10.500
You can't be afraid
to move forward.

01:15:11.625 --> 01:15:12.667
I love you,

01:15:13.708 --> 01:15:14.917
but so does he.

01:15:16.875 --> 01:15:18.125
And I know that you love him.

01:15:20.792 --> 01:15:22.083
You can do this.

01:15:51.792 --> 01:15:53.292
Gregory Hampton Kim...

01:15:55.208 --> 01:15:56.417
will you marry me?

01:16:10.917 --> 01:16:12.417
Attention, everyone!

01:16:12.458 --> 01:16:14.708
I would like to present

01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:16.833
the future Mr. and Mrs....

01:16:16.875 --> 01:16:18.792
Nobody cares. Okay?

01:16:26.458 --> 01:16:27.958
What are you doing on our boat?

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.167
Your buddy got on the radio
and said those magic words.

01:16:30.250 --> 01:16:32.456
Mayday, mayday, mayday!
Which gives me

01:16:32.458 --> 01:16:34.333
full authority
to come on board

01:16:34.417 --> 01:16:35.417
and commandeer your vessel,

01:16:35.458 --> 01:16:38.250
so I'm commandeering
your vessel.

01:16:38.292 --> 01:16:40.875
Hicks over here is gonna write
you guys so many tickets,

01:16:40.917 --> 01:16:42.290
you'll never pay them off.

01:16:42.292 --> 01:16:43.750
You'll think your student loan
is a nickel

01:16:43.792 --> 01:16:44.917
found in the couch.

01:16:44.958 --> 01:16:46.167
I've waited ten years
for tonight.

01:16:46.208 --> 01:16:48.250
Ten years since we...

01:16:48.292 --> 01:16:50.250
caught you counseling
that kid in the bathroom

01:16:50.292 --> 01:16:51.750
and got you kicked
off the force.

01:16:53.083 --> 01:16:54.542
Mmm.

01:16:55.917 --> 01:16:58.250
What is that, Hi-C?

01:16:58.292 --> 01:17:00.417
You're a pussy,
and I'm embarrassed for you.

01:17:00.458 --> 01:17:03.290
This is like a, what,
a high school reunion?

01:17:03.292 --> 01:17:04.500
Is that what you guys
are doing here,

01:17:04.542 --> 01:17:05.625
getting the gang
back together?

01:17:05.667 --> 01:17:06.958
You got the Hawaiian shirt guy.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.750
We have the theater nerds,
still playing dress-up.

01:17:09.792 --> 01:17:11.292
What are you, forty?
What are you doing?

01:17:12.667 --> 01:17:14.623
What is this?
We got the teen mom,

01:17:14.625 --> 01:17:16.958
still trying to convince
everybody she's still hot.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.208
Mm-mm. Luke warm.

01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:21.042
Very high luke warm,
don't get me wrong.

01:17:21.083 --> 01:17:22.208
There's the popular girl,

01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:23.625
still playing
with all the boys' heads.

01:17:25.583 --> 01:17:26.875
Then we got the wise ass.

01:17:26.917 --> 01:17:29.625
Everything you say gets
everybody else in trouble.

01:17:29.667 --> 01:17:31.042
You know that?

01:17:31.083 --> 01:17:32.333
Then we have the know-it-all.

01:17:32.375 --> 01:17:33.958
Well, guess what, Sean?
You're not a know-it-all

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.417
because you partnered
with a wise ass,

01:17:35.458 --> 01:17:37.167
your boat ran out of gas
and it sunk,

01:17:37.208 --> 01:17:39.542
and that's why I'm here.
You're done.

01:17:39.583 --> 01:17:43.042
In two days, you guys are going
to be pumping gas, you follow?

01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:44.333
You're gonna be pump...

01:17:46.292 --> 01:17:47.792
Wow.

01:17:47.833 --> 01:17:49.333
There is-you can tear it.

01:17:49.375 --> 01:17:52.458
Pumpin'... Pumpin' gas.

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:54.792
Pumpin' ga... Whoa!

01:17:54.833 --> 01:17:57.625
Fishies. Pumping... Pumping gas.

01:17:57.667 --> 01:18:01.417
Pumping gas,
pumping gas, pumping gas.

01:18:01.458 --> 01:18:04.583
Pump's a funny word! There are
two P's. Pumping gas!

01:18:04.625 --> 01:18:06.958
What in the hell is going on?

01:18:07.042 --> 01:18:09.583
So, you know how Chuck has been
snatching cups out of my hand

01:18:09.625 --> 01:18:12.292
and chugging 'em
since we were freshman?

01:18:12.333 --> 01:18:13.750
I took a couple
of those Combo Locks

01:18:13.792 --> 01:18:15.208
and put them in my drink.

01:18:15.250 --> 01:18:17.333
Pumping gas,
pumping gas, I'm pumping gas.

01:18:17.375 --> 01:18:18.458
Pumping gas.

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:19.708
Come on, let's go.

01:18:22.625 --> 01:18:24.667
- Are you serious?
- I am.

01:18:24.708 --> 01:18:26.875
- Boogie-woogie-woogie...
- Whoo!

01:18:26.958 --> 01:18:28.790
Whoo! Volume!

01:18:28.792 --> 01:18:31.875
I believe Officer Walsh
is asking for some volume.

01:18:31.958 --> 01:18:33.623
Would you like to provide
the man with some volume?

01:18:33.625 --> 01:18:35.000
I think I would.

01:18:53.375 --> 01:18:54.792
Are you sure you're okay?

01:18:54.833 --> 01:18:56.625
Yeah, Max gave me
some aspirin!

01:18:56.667 --> 01:18:57.875
Wha...

01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:03.500
Hey, sparky,

01:19:03.542 --> 01:19:04.958

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.956

2-5-5-3! Whoo!

01:19:13.667 --> 01:19:15.623
And what are you doing
on this boat?

01:19:15.625 --> 01:19:17.417
I'm tripping balls!

01:19:17.458 --> 01:19:18.790
What was that?

01:19:18.792 --> 01:19:20.290
I'm tripping balls!

01:19:20.292 --> 01:19:22.417
Yeah, I'm tripping balls!

01:19:46.583 --> 01:19:47.625
Yo!

01:19:48.958 --> 01:19:50.792
Sorry I dosed
your partner, Hicks.

01:19:52.208 --> 01:19:53.667
Not even worried about it.

01:19:53.708 --> 01:19:55.167
Looks like
I'm getting bumped up.

01:19:57.625 --> 01:19:59.667
Also...

01:19:59.750 --> 01:20:01.623
looks like you won't be needing
these citations.

01:20:01.625 --> 01:20:03.500
Hey!

01:20:03.583 --> 01:20:04.792
My man!

01:20:05.875 --> 01:20:07.750
- Let's party!
- Let's party!

01:20:07.792 --> 01:20:09.958
Hey, you wouldn't happen to have
any spare gas, would you?

01:20:10.042 --> 01:20:11.917
I think I got a few cans. Yeah.

01:20:11.958 --> 01:20:13.333
Let's party, man.

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:14.542
Let's party.

01:20:34.292 --> 01:20:35.458
I gotta say,

01:20:36.542 --> 01:20:37.792
epic party, Max.

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:39.083
Thank you.

01:20:39.125 --> 01:20:41.625
You know, I got some ideas
on how to cut costs.

01:20:41.667 --> 01:20:43.000
Get a little leaner,

01:20:43.083 --> 01:20:45.123
except you'll have
to show me the, uh...

01:20:45.125 --> 01:20:47.708
- The books.
- Yes!

01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:50.625
Then again you'll have to
tell me what the numbers mean.

01:20:50.708 --> 01:20:52.250
Absolutely.

01:20:52.292 --> 01:20:54.208
But you do know tonight wasn't
all about the money, right?

01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:57.292
I know.

01:21:00.417 --> 01:21:02.208
I'm really proud of you,
Seanie boy.

01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:03.833
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:21:03.875 --> 01:21:05.042
For what?

01:21:05.083 --> 01:21:06.583
Standing up to Walsh
the way that you did.

01:21:06.625 --> 01:21:07.750
That took...

01:21:09.125 --> 01:21:10.208
You know?

01:21:11.708 --> 01:21:14.292
I also want to thank you
for always having my back too.

01:21:14.333 --> 01:21:17.542
Tonight, last week...

01:21:17.625 --> 01:21:18.833
the last twenty years.

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:24.125
Dude. First mates forever.

01:21:25.667 --> 01:21:27.458
Ah, Seanie,

01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:29.750
I love ya. Always have.

01:21:31.583 --> 01:21:32.792
I love you too.

01:21:34.875 --> 01:21:37.417
- Now...
- Uh, there it is.

01:21:37.458 --> 01:21:39.042
- Oh! Oh!
- There it is.

01:21:39.083 --> 01:21:40.792
- There it is.
- Hold on. Hold on. Look at this.

01:21:44.542 --> 01:21:45.583
Cheers.

01:21:46.667 --> 01:21:47.792
Mmm.

01:21:49.667 --> 01:21:51.125
- Whoo!
- What do you say

01:21:51.167 --> 01:21:53.208
we show these people
how to really party?

01:21:53.292 --> 01:21:54.792
Especially that girl
right there.

01:21:54.833 --> 01:21:57.290
- Right there? Let's go.
- Yeah.

01:21:57.292 --> 01:22:01.456
Let us dance til' dawn! Arrgh!

01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:02.792
Body roll!

01:22:02.833 --> 01:22:05.417
Fly, Carmichael. Arrr!

01:22:43.583 --> 01:22:45.833
That was the best party
of my life!

01:22:45.917 --> 01:22:48.623
I'm telling everyone
you guys rock!

01:22:48.625 --> 01:22:50.125
Awesome.

01:22:50.167 --> 01:22:52.750
Please let me stay!

01:22:52.792 --> 01:22:54.456
I wanna live on this boat!

01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:56.956
- Thank you.
- You don't gotta go home,

01:22:56.958 --> 01:22:59.292
but you gotta get
the hell out of here!

01:22:59.375 --> 01:23:00.458
Thank you, guys.

01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:03.125
Eomma, I hope we showed you
a good time.

01:23:03.167 --> 01:23:04.875
It was the night of my life.

01:23:06.625 --> 01:23:08.125
What the hell was that?

01:23:08.167 --> 01:23:10.292
That's the S.S. Party Boat
weaving its magic,

01:23:10.333 --> 01:23:12.000
that's what that is.

01:23:12.042 --> 01:23:15.417
Uh, should we get breakfast?

01:23:15.458 --> 01:23:16.958
It's on me.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.042
Ooh.

01:23:22.542 --> 01:23:25.123
That guy's crazy.
It might work out.

01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:26.667
Guys, this is my masterpiece.

01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:29.292
- Too bad you have to delete that.
- Mm-hmm.

01:23:29.333 --> 01:23:30.833
Freedom of the press, no way!

01:23:30.917 --> 01:23:32.956
What! What happens on the party
boat stays on the party boat.

01:23:32.958 --> 01:23:33.958
Stays.

01:23:34.958 --> 01:23:36.456
Guys,

01:23:36.458 --> 01:23:38.042
I can't thank you enough.

01:23:38.083 --> 01:23:39.290
Oh, Greg, you don't have
to do this.

01:23:39.292 --> 01:23:40.583
Tha-That party was a disaster.

01:23:40.625 --> 01:23:42.000
Hey. She said yes, right?

01:23:42.042 --> 01:23:44.417
Well, technically, she said no,
but then you said yes.

01:23:45.417 --> 01:23:46.792
I'm a man of my word.

01:23:46.833 --> 01:23:49.458
You should really hang out
with us more often, Greg.

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.667
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:23:51.708 --> 01:23:52.833
It's good with me, matey.

01:23:52.875 --> 01:23:55.542
Well, just take it easy
on the mateys.

01:23:55.583 --> 01:23:56.833
Okay?

01:23:58.208 --> 01:23:59.958
I'm gonna go catch up
with my Eomma, all right?

01:24:08.792 --> 01:24:11.292
So, floating wedding next year?

01:24:15.083 --> 01:24:17.123
Again, about everything,
I'm really sorry and...

01:24:17.125 --> 01:24:19.208
Stop it.
You threw a great party,

01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:22.125
and you gave me the greatest
proposal story of all time.

01:24:23.125 --> 01:24:24.250
Anything for my first mate.

01:24:25.292 --> 01:24:26.417
Come here.

01:24:35.208 --> 01:24:36.333
L-Let go.

01:24:36.375 --> 01:24:38.292
- Hmm? Oh, yeah.
- Let go.

01:24:38.333 --> 01:24:39.417
My bad.

01:24:41.208 --> 01:24:42.500
Congratulations.

01:24:42.542 --> 01:24:44.375
Thanks, I'll see you soon.

01:24:44.458 --> 01:24:45.667
You got it.

01:24:50.083 --> 01:24:52.417
- Wow.
- Yep.

01:24:52.458 --> 01:24:53.625
Our work here is done.

01:24:53.667 --> 01:24:55.917
- And nobody died.
- Nobody died

01:25:04.417 --> 01:25:06.458
Hey, Sean!

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:08.167
- You know what I was thinking?
- What's that?

01:25:08.208 --> 01:25:09.792
- Tahiti.
- Tahiti?

01:25:09.833 --> 01:25:11.000
- Tahiti.
- You wanna do Tahiti?

01:25:11.042 --> 01:25:12.208
- Absolutely.
- We should do Tahiti.

01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:13.333
Sailboat.

01:25:14.542 --> 01:25:16.042
- You like it?
- Dude, I love it.

01:25:16.083 --> 01:25:17.500
You know what?
I do like Tahiti.

01:25:17.542 --> 01:25:19.458
I'm telling you man,
stick with me,

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:21.417
- I'll make all your dreams come true.
- We're going places,

01:25:21.458 --> 01:25:22.708
we're going places.

01:25:22.792 --> 01:25:25.708
Tahiti!

01:25:25.792 --> 01:25:27.667
We're coming for you, bitches.

01:25:27.708 --> 01:25:30.750
- Oh, God.
- No rush. There's no rush.

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:33.125
Hey, Hicks, what's Eddie Van
Halen look like in real life?

01:25:33.167 --> 01:25:34.623
I don't know. Get to the bed.

01:25:34.625 --> 01:25:36.623
- Three locks, three locks.
- Get to the bed. Get to the bed.

01:25:36.625 --> 01:25:38.456
I'm going! You're not even
on the bed.

01:25:38.458 --> 01:25:40.292
- I know I'm not.
- Oh, my God.

01:25:40.375 --> 01:25:42.790
You know what? You need
a quesadilla. You need one.

01:25:42.792 --> 01:25:44.042
No, no, no, lay down.
Lay down.

01:25:44.083 --> 01:25:45.708
- Walsh!
- What?

01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:47.375
- Lay down!
- I got muenster in the fridge.

01:25:47.417 --> 01:25:48.833
Lay down and relax!

01:25:48.875 --> 01:25:50.625
I'm relaxed, you're the one
that's not relaxed.

01:25:50.667 --> 01:25:53.042
Alright, Walsh.
I'll see you later.

01:25:53.083 --> 01:25:54.083
Probably at your hearing.

01:25:54.125 --> 01:25:56.083
At my hearing.

01:25:56.125 --> 01:25:58.083
I can hear.

01:25:58.125 --> 01:26:01.500
Hicksy, slide me over
one of those buckets, okay?

01:26:03.167 --> 01:26:04.290
Which one?

01:26:04.292 --> 01:26:06.125
It's too early to tell.

01:26:08.625 --> 01:26:10.208
You know what, just scoot over.

01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:13.456
You're too wasted
to leave alone,

01:26:13.458 --> 01:26:15.167
and I'm too tired
to go home, so...

01:26:18.958 --> 01:26:21.208
Big spoon or little spoon?

01:26:21.250 --> 01:26:22.708
It's too early to tell.

01:26:29.958 --> 01:26:32.000
Are you sure this bed is...

01:26:36.708 --> 01:26:38.042
Oh, God.

01:26:38.083 --> 01:26:39.625
I can smell your sunscreen.

01:26:40.875 --> 01:26:42.917
Go to bed, Walsh.

01:29:37.076 --> 01:29:42.076
