Cousin, cousin, I did it!

01:33.794 --> 01:35.195
I did it, I did it!

01:35.228 --> 01:36.730
I cashed my paycheck.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.465
I withdraw all my savings,
and I recycled

01:39.499 --> 01:40.867
all our aluminum cans.

01:40.901 --> 01:43.570
And I have enough money
to buy a car.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.471
Well, congratulations, Balki.

01:45.506 --> 01:50.644
Well, thanks, come on,
let's go buy me a car right now.

01:50.677 --> 01:53.413
You can't just go out
and buy a car.

01:53.446 --> 01:54.414
‐‐No?
‐‐No, you gotta do

01:54.447 --> 01:56.149
some research first.

01:56.182 --> 01:57.551
‐‐Research?
‐‐Yes, you gotta read

01:57.584 --> 01:59.620
Consumer Reports about the makes
and models

01:59.653 --> 02:01.321
you're interested in.

02:01.354 --> 02:02.889
You gotta check around,
shop around

02:02.923 --> 02:04.925
to the various dealers,
see what they have to offer.

02:04.958 --> 02:10.263
No, no, cousin,
no need for that.

02:10.295 --> 02:12.432
I'm gonna go right down to
Honest Achmed's

02:12.465 --> 02:15.569
Used Car Caravan.

02:15.602 --> 02:16.503
Honest Achmed?

02:16.537 --> 02:17.938
Yeah.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.640
You know, the guy on television
who says he'd kiss

02:19.673 --> 02:23.443
a camel to sell a car.

02:23.476 --> 02:26.747
Uh, Balki, sit down.

02:26.780 --> 02:30.617
Now, how can I say
this tactfully?

02:30.651 --> 02:34.320
I wouldn't know.

02:34.354 --> 02:36.690
If you try to buy a car
from Honest Achmed,

02:36.723 --> 02:40.193
he'll eat you alive.

02:40.226 --> 02:44.831
He's a cannibal?

02:44.865 --> 02:46.600
No, no.

02:46.633 --> 02:51.738
What I'm trying to say is that
Honest Achmed isn't honest.

02:51.772 --> 02:54.307
He isn't even Achmed.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.809
His real name is Burt Williams,
and he probably stole

02:55.842 --> 02:58.679
that camel he kisses.

02:58.712 --> 03:00.514
Cousin, why would he lie?

03:00.547 --> 03:02.583
To make money.

03:02.616 --> 03:05.385
You know, Balki, my father had
a system for finding

03:05.418 --> 03:06.987
reliable cars.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.556
He called it the Appleton
Used Car Rating System.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.525
I think it might be
just what you need.

03:11.558 --> 03:13.359
Well, well, cousin, come on.

03:13.393 --> 03:18.865
I'm sure your father was wise
behind his ears but,

03:18.899 --> 03:20.466
I don't think I need
his system.

03:20.501 --> 03:23.904
You know, this, this Mepio
didn't just fall

03:23.937 --> 03:26.640
off the turnip train,
you know.

03:26.673 --> 03:28.575
Well, I know you didn't.

03:28.609 --> 03:32.679
But, suppose you buy a car
without the Appleton

03:32.713 --> 03:34.715
Used Car Rating System.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.382
What would happen?

03:36.416 --> 03:40.020
Well, let's look
into the future.

03:40.053 --> 03:43.289
Look, it's a dark
and stormy night.

03:43.323 --> 03:45.526
I wake up
with terrible pains.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.693
Cousin, where does it hurt?

03:46.727 --> 03:47.961
Well, right there, right there.

03:47.994 --> 03:49.796
Right, I think it's
my appendix.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.833
And oh, Balki, you've
got to get me to the hospital.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.334
Cousin, it's no problem.

03:54.367 --> 03:55.802
I drive you in my new car.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.437
Oh, good, good.

03:57.470 --> 03:59.540
But when we get into your car,
it won't start.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.508
You've got to get
me to the hospital.

04:01.542 --> 04:04.678
Cousin, I'm trying, but
my car won't start.

04:04.711 --> 04:05.979
Help!
Help!

04:06.012 --> 04:07.347
Help!

04:07.380 --> 04:08.549
It's two in the morning.

04:08.582 --> 04:09.616
There's no one around.

04:09.650 --> 04:10.684
Oops, my appendix just burst.

04:10.717 --> 04:15.288
I'm dead.

04:15.321 --> 04:17.322
And all because you
wouldn't use

04:17.357 --> 04:19.892
the Appleton Used Car
Rating System

04:19.926 --> 04:25.599
and bought a bad, bad car.

04:25.632 --> 04:28.034
Oh, cousin, I don't want,
I don't want

04:28.068 --> 04:32.573
your death on my head
and shoulders.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.941
Give me the Appleton
Used Car Rating System.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.376
Only if you're sure.

04:36.409 --> 04:37.744
Cousin, I'm sure, I'm sure.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.546
I'm sure, what do I do?

04:39.580 --> 04:40.747
Now, first, give me
all your money.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.449
Who are you kidding?

04:43.483 --> 04:46.620
Give me your money.

04:46.653 --> 04:47.788
Okay.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.389
Now, don't worry.

04:49.422 --> 04:50.991
I'll use the Appleton System
to get you

04:51.024 --> 04:53.727
the right car
at the right price.

04:53.760 --> 04:54.928
Thank you, cousin.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.530
And after you pick out my car,
can I get

04:56.563 --> 04:58.632
a personalized license plate?

04:58.665 --> 04:59.900
Oh, sure, why not?

04:59.933 --> 05:01.868
I want one that says,
"Make the world

05:01.902 --> 05:06.740
a better place by being
nice to everyone you meet."

05:11.745 --> 05:14.781
You think that one
is taken?

05:14.815 --> 05:17.350
We'll have to check.

05:17.383 --> 05:20.754
My second choice is,
"Eat my rust."

05:33.567 --> 05:35.502
Come on, I want you
to see this.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.003
Hey, Harri, Lydia.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.371
Just keep up what
you're doing, I want Lydia

05:38.404 --> 05:40.006
to watch it for awhile.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.975
Oh, so, Harriette's told
you about the Appleton

05:42.008 --> 05:44.144
Used Car Rating System.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.513
You know, it was developed
by my dad to make sure

05:46.547 --> 05:48.014
we kids bought used cars
that would run

05:48.048 --> 05:50.651
trouble‐free for years.

05:50.684 --> 05:54.988
This is a computer print out of
every used car for sale

05:55.021 --> 05:56.823
in the Chicagoland area.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.559
Oh, there certainly are
a lot of them.

05:58.592 --> 06:02.563
14,227.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.698
Before computers, used to take
my dad forever to do this.

06:04.731 --> 06:07.701
He started shopping
for my first car

06:07.734 --> 06:10.436
when I was 12 years old.

06:10.470 --> 06:12.639
Ask him how he plans
to narrow that down.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.808
Well, using another computer
program, I've eliminated

06:14.841 --> 06:18.444
all the trucks,
four‐wheel drive vehicles, RVs

06:18.478 --> 06:20.581
and everything costing
more than $2500.

06:20.614 --> 06:21.782
But, don't‐‐

06:21.815 --> 06:24.417
then the cars themselves
are rated according

06:24.450 --> 06:27.788
to such things as, mileage,
previous service record,

06:27.821 --> 06:28.822
coefficient of drag.

06:28.855 --> 06:29.823
Do you feel‐‐

06:29.856 --> 06:31.692
and then the ratings are
factored

06:31.725 --> 06:33.560
against the sale prices of the
cars,

06:33.594 --> 06:35.061
which reduces
the list even further

06:35.095 --> 06:38.665
down to the one car in Chicago
most likely to give Balki

06:38.699 --> 06:41.167
worry‐free driving
well into the next century.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.907
Were you a bedwetter?

06:54.114 --> 06:56.850
I'm just tryin'
to help the guy.

06:56.883 --> 06:58.752
Uh‐huh, what if your computer
doesn't find a car

06:58.785 --> 07:01.187
that Balki likes?

07:01.221 --> 07:04.490
Well, what does "like"
have to do with it?

07:04.525 --> 07:06.993
I didn't like the car
my father got for me.

07:07.027 --> 07:10.664
But it is still running.

07:10.697 --> 07:11.665
Well, what do ya think?

07:11.698 --> 07:12.799
You're right.

07:12.833 --> 07:16.537
He is a sick man.

07:16.570 --> 07:17.771
That's what I thought.

07:17.804 --> 07:21.942
I just wanted
a professional opinion.

07:21.975 --> 07:27.147
Dad always said
people wouldn't understand.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.650
Cousin, cousin, I found it,
I found it.

07:29.683 --> 07:32.052
I found the car of my dreams,
and it's right here

07:32.085 --> 07:34.755
in our parking garage, come on!

07:39.860 --> 07:43.196
And what is it, Balki,
that makes this the car

07:43.229 --> 07:44.197
of your dreams?

07:44.230 --> 07:46.166
It's red.

07:46.199 --> 07:51.538
Come on!

07:51.572 --> 07:53.707
Cousin, you can't see
it from there.

07:53.740 --> 07:56.577
Balki, Balki, you're gonna
have to have

07:56.610 --> 07:59.012
better reasons for buying
a car, other than the fact

07:59.045 --> 08:01.247
that it's red.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.517
Oh, I do, I do.

08:03.550 --> 08:04.518
You do?

08:04.551 --> 08:05.218
Yes, I do.

08:05.251 --> 08:07.854
Well, let's list your reasons.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.990
List them?

08:10.023 --> 08:15.028
Well, uh, it's got
those little flaps

08:15.061 --> 08:17.898
that keep the mud
from getting up on the fender.

08:22.268 --> 08:24.270
Uh‐huh.

08:24.304 --> 08:29.843
And, uh, it's got, it's got,
the aerial goes at an angle,

08:29.876 --> 08:32.813
so you feel like you're drivin'
fast all the time.

08:37.082 --> 08:39.986
Uh‐huh.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.923
Oh, oh, and this is what
really sold me.

08:42.956 --> 08:46.893
It's got one of those
Garfields stuck to the window.

08:56.102 --> 08:59.272
Balki, I thought that car
might catch your eye.

08:59.305 --> 09:00.340
You saw it, too?

09:00.373 --> 09:02.876
Yeah, saw, I ran it
through the Appleton System.

09:02.909 --> 09:03.810
How did it do?

09:03.844 --> 09:05.011
It didn't measure up.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.014
Cousin, you know, I...

09:08.048 --> 09:13.654
I had a silly idea that buying
a car would be fun.

09:13.687 --> 09:17.157
Balki, buying a car is not
supposed to be fun.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.159
The fun comes years from now
when you look back

09:19.192 --> 09:24.865
and see you were
a good consumer.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.133
You weren't breastfed,
were you.

09:37.878 --> 09:41.381
Years from now,
you'll thank me.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.217
Years from now,
I'll buy a red car.

09:58.364 --> 09:59.866
Don't look, don't look.

09:59.900 --> 10:03.336
Cousin, I can't stand it,
I can't stand it!

10:03.369 --> 10:06.707
I got you the most
reliable used car in Chicago.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.375
Okay, open your eyes.

10:15.281 --> 10:19.185
Oh, cousin, it's beautiful.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.386
I think so, too.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.761
Balki, Balki.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.663
Cousin, you are the best.

10:29.696 --> 10:33.099
Cousin, I'm sorry I talked all
those terrible things about you.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.436
I mean, never, never in my
wildest dreams.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.704
It's a convertible!

10:37.738 --> 10:43.176
It's a convertible!

10:43.209 --> 10:45.145
No, no, no.

10:45.178 --> 10:49.349
Balki, come on, no, no, no, no.

10:49.382 --> 10:52.118
Balki, Balki.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.386
This isn't your car.

10:53.419 --> 10:55.421
‐ It isn't?
‐ No.

10:55.455 --> 11:00.093
This is your car.

11:00.126 --> 11:05.766
Oh, god.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.734
I knew you'd like it.

11:07.768 --> 11:11.271
And thanks to the Appleton
System, this car is so reliable,

11:11.304 --> 11:13.073
you could be driving it forever.

11:18.845 --> 11:22.348
That long?

11:22.382 --> 11:26.753
So, what do you say
we start this baby up

11:26.787 --> 11:28.154
and take her for a spin?

11:33.960 --> 11:37.864
I was just as excited
when I got my first car.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.834
Come on, come on, come on.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.903
Don't be shy.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.754
Huh?

12:00.787 --> 12:04.357
Listen to that engine purr.

12:04.390 --> 12:09.429
That is the sound
of the Appleton System at work.

12:35.121 --> 12:39.492
Okay, Balki, start it up.

12:39.526 --> 12:44.130
Okay, Balki, start the engine.

12:44.164 --> 12:47.868
Balki, turn the key,
start it up.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.804
Balki, start her up.

12:50.837 --> 12:54.841
Balki, turn it‐‐

12:54.875 --> 12:55.576
What are you doing out here?

12:55.609 --> 12:58.178
Just hangin' out.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.079
I told you to start the car.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.548
Yeah, well, I tried,
nothing happened.

13:01.582 --> 13:04.150
Well, I'm sure it's just
a simple problem.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.019
Well, I have a simple solution.

13:06.052 --> 13:09.022
Why don't we take this thing
back and get another one?

13:09.055 --> 13:12.258
Possibly a red one.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.493
Balki, we are not taking
it back.

13:13.527 --> 13:15.061
There is nothing wrong
with it.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.963
Well, there is one thing
wrong with it.

13:16.997 --> 13:20.300
It won't start.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.335
I'm sure it's just
a small adjustment.

13:22.368 --> 13:25.038
It passed the Appleton
System with flying colors.

13:25.071 --> 13:30.010
Well, maybe the Appleton System
should take a flying leap.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.845
Cousin, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

13:31.878 --> 13:36.182
It just slipped out.

13:36.216 --> 13:38.384
Balki, have a little faith.

13:38.418 --> 13:41.522
Even as kids, some of us had
our doubts about dad's system.

13:41.555 --> 13:44.257
I can see why.

13:44.290 --> 13:48.895
But it never, ever
let us down.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.531
Now, come on, give me
a hand here.

13:50.564 --> 13:52.866
The problem seems to be
with the electrical system.

13:52.899 --> 13:55.401
So, we have to check and see
if the battery

13:55.435 --> 13:57.538
is delivering sufficient power.

13:57.571 --> 14:00.306
Grab a screwdriver.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.509
All we have to do
is touch these screwdrivers

14:02.543 --> 14:05.345
to the battery terminals and see
if there's any electricity.

14:09.950 --> 14:14.420
Cousin, it seems that
the battery is dead.

14:14.454 --> 14:20.193
You know, Mr. Wizard once said
that electricity won't flow

14:20.226 --> 14:23.964
unless there is
a complete circuit.

14:23.997 --> 14:27.901
I wonder what he meant by that?

14:27.934 --> 14:29.335
Ah!

14:51.091 --> 14:52.659
Battery's fine.

15:05.539 --> 15:08.308
Okay.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.076
I think now we're
getting somewhere.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.579
Well, that's what you said
when you stripped

15:12.613 --> 15:15.415
the threads on the carburrito.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.583
It's carburetor.

15:16.617 --> 15:18.418
Car‐bur‐etor.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.419
And it was an accident.

15:19.452 --> 15:22.623
What, you never made a mistake
in your life?

15:22.656 --> 15:25.325
Not of this magnitude.

15:25.358 --> 15:29.730
You know, Balki, I am doing
all this for you.

15:29.763 --> 15:32.533
I found the car for you.

15:32.566 --> 15:35.335
I made the deal for you.

15:35.368 --> 15:38.038
And I am trying to fix it
for you.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.272
You're right there, cousin.

15:39.305 --> 15:43.076
We wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

15:48.649 --> 15:50.517
Okay, well, tell you what,

15:50.551 --> 15:55.088
if you don't wanna help,
why don't you just go home.

15:57.658 --> 16:02.763
Cousin, I would love
to go home,

16:02.796 --> 16:04.965
but my car don't work.

16:10.370 --> 16:13.306
All right, look, I tell
you what,

16:13.339 --> 16:14.775
we're both very tired
and we've been working

16:14.808 --> 16:17.377
on this all weekend.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.713
Well, I think it would be best
if we just put our differences

16:19.746 --> 16:22.716
aside and worked together.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.718
Cousin, you're right.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.087
You're right, and you're right.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.755
You're right.

16:28.789 --> 16:31.157
Okay, what can I do to help?

16:31.191 --> 16:33.694
Well, well, to start with
you could

16:33.727 --> 16:39.232
put in the oil.

16:39.265 --> 16:42.235
Of course, we wouldn't have
to put in new oil

16:42.268 --> 16:44.304
if you hadn't broken
the oil filter

16:44.337 --> 16:46.540
when you were trying to fix
the fuel pump, huh?

16:51.344 --> 16:53.580
Well, the fuel pump wouldn't
have been broken

16:53.614 --> 16:56.482
if you hadn't hit it
with a hammer.

16:56.517 --> 17:00.220
Huh?

17:00.253 --> 17:01.688
Cousin, you told me
to hit it with a hammer.

17:01.722 --> 17:05.125
I said tap, tap it
with a hammer.

17:05.157 --> 17:08.595
Tap, hit, eight of one,
half a dozen of another.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.032
Just put in the oil.

17:19.439 --> 17:22.175
Cousin, when you, when you‐‐

17:22.208 --> 17:23.743
‐ Balki.
‐ Let me just ask you this.

17:23.777 --> 17:25.310
Balki, just put in the oil.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.180
‐ Put in the oil!
‐ Let me just ask you this.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.381
Let me just ask you this
question.

17:28.414 --> 17:30.116
Put in the oil.
Put in the oil.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.618
Put in the oil, now!

17:31.652 --> 17:33.119
Now!
Now!

17:37.624 --> 17:39.560
Okay.

17:51.137 --> 17:52.272
Cousin, I just wanna ask you
one little question.

17:52.305 --> 17:57.310
Balki, put in the oil, now!

18:38.785 --> 18:41.454
Cousin, was this what you‐‐

18:41.487 --> 18:44.157
Thank you.

18:59.906 --> 19:03.944
Well, Balki, we did it.

19:03.977 --> 19:06.547
Yup, we took apart everything
in my car

19:06.580 --> 19:11.818
and put it back together again.

19:11.852 --> 19:14.688
You have to do that sometimes.

19:14.721 --> 19:18.291
The amazing thing is we don't
have any parts left over.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.192
Always a good sign.

19:19.225 --> 19:22.195
Well, Balki, why don't we
start it up

19:22.228 --> 19:24.297
and take this baby
for a spin.

19:33.774 --> 19:35.509
Cousin, it started.

19:35.542 --> 19:39.345
Chalk up one more
for the Appleton System.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.247
Why don't we turn it off
and call it a victory?

19:41.281 --> 19:42.816
No, no, no, no.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.785
Put her into drive.

19:44.818 --> 19:49.289
That would be the d?

19:49.322 --> 19:53.493
Yes, it would.

19:53.527 --> 19:55.461
Perfect.

19:55.495 --> 19:58.965
Balki, you are about to drive
your very own car

19:58.999 --> 20:00.634
for the first time.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.436
This is a moment you'll
never forget.

20:03.469 --> 20:06.439
Cousin, thank you
for making it possible.

20:06.472 --> 20:08.742
Hey, don't thank me.

20:08.775 --> 20:12.946
Thank the Appleton Used
Car Rating System.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.749
Go ahead, Balki, step
on the gas.

20:33.534 --> 20:38.672
Cousin, in the Appleton System,
exactly when do

20:38.705 --> 20:41.374
you admit failure?

21:04.397 --> 21:07.000
Cousin, thank you for helping
me buy my first car.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.435
Actually, it was your second.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.805
No, I don't count
the first one.

21:11.838 --> 21:15.509
I never actually drove it,
forward.

21:18.679 --> 21:21.447
Well, I'm just glad
Honest Achmed gave ya

21:21.481 --> 21:23.449
a good deal on the trade‐in.

21:23.483 --> 21:27.420
Yeah, $150 for a car
that only drives backwards

21:27.453 --> 21:30.423
ain't bad.

21:30.456 --> 21:35.596
And I'm really happy
with the red car I just bought.

21:35.629 --> 21:39.365
Balki, I owe you an apology.

21:39.399 --> 21:42.035
I thought the Appleton System
was foolproof

21:42.068 --> 21:45.972
and that's why I couldn't admit
that...

21:46.006 --> 21:48.809
Your car was a lemon.

21:48.842 --> 21:54.047
No, cousin, it was
a sedan.

21:54.080 --> 21:59.820
And it was just about
the ugliest one I've ever seen

21:59.853 --> 22:01.955
in my life,

22:01.988 --> 22:03.557
except for that picture you
showed me

22:03.590 --> 22:05.091
of your first car.

22:05.125 --> 22:07.761
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.429
My dad picked that car out.

22:09.462 --> 22:11.598
That car was reliable.

22:11.632 --> 22:14.100
Car was fuel efficient.

22:14.134 --> 22:19.405
Car was ugly.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.942
Oh, boy.

22:21.975 --> 22:25.712
You know something, I hated
that, I hated that car.

22:27.848 --> 22:31.051
But I could never tell my dad.

22:31.084 --> 22:32.719
Cousin, you know what I think?

22:32.753 --> 22:34.521
First thing in the morning,
you should call up

22:34.555 --> 22:39.860
your papa and get that piece
of your mind off your chest.

22:39.893 --> 22:42.996
You're right, I will, I will.

22:43.029 --> 22:48.101
And Balki, tomorrow,
when we go into work,

22:48.134 --> 22:51.404
we don't know anything about
that hole in the wall.
