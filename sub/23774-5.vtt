01:50.170 --> 01:51.620
[Beal] So much like Egypt.

Slow down, slow down.

02:05.670 --> 02:07.620
Let's start with
the basics.

- Catherine.

02:20.170 --> 02:22.790
Okay, who are you?

Catherine.

02:24.710 --> 02:27.000
Catherine, no,
no, no.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.170
I. Am. Catherine.

02:30.170 --> 02:31.170
Catherine.

02:31.170 --> 02:33.040
He is Beal.

02:33.040 --> 02:34.250
Beal.

02:34.250 --> 02:36.670
Who are you?

02:36.670 --> 02:38.420
Is Beal?

02:38.420 --> 02:39.540
Is Beal.

02:39.540 --> 02:41.040
No.
No, no.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.670
Catherine, Beal.

02:43.670 --> 02:45.330
Kasuf.

Kasoof?

Kasuf.

Wait!

03:10.920 --> 03:13.540
Kasoof!
Kasuf!

03:14.420 --> 03:16.000
You're doing
wonderfully.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.750
I do hope he takes us
somewhere safe.

03:18.750 --> 03:19.830
We need to lay low.

03:19.830 --> 03:20.670
Lay low?
Yes.

03:20.670 --> 03:21.620
What about
my father?

03:21.620 --> 03:23.120
One thing at a
time, Cat.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.460
Well those footprints at the
temple could be my fathers.

03:25.460 --> 03:27.670
Those could've just as easily
been left by that warrior.

03:27.670 --> 03:29.580
And I don't know how much
your magic stick

03:29.580 --> 03:32.460
can do against an army
of women like that.

03:32.460 --> 03:36.830
- Well maybe if we--

Where is everyone?

04:14.830 --> 04:16.620
Hello?

04:16.620 --> 04:19.210
Is there a Professor
Langford here?

04:28.120 --> 04:29.370
We've lost our guide.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.500
I don't like this.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.460
Stay calm.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.870
Okay, okay.

04:41.670 --> 04:43.420
Dear God, we are--

04:43.420 --> 04:44.870
Doomed.

04:44.870 --> 04:46.370
Nonsense.

04:46.370 --> 04:49.370
I brought us here safely,
I shall return us home safely,

04:49.370 --> 04:53.000
Nobody even knows
we are here.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.580
Stefan, calm.

05:04.710 --> 05:06.290

05:06.920 --> 05:07.870
Yeah.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.040
Eva please, turn
that camera off.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.330
But you have a good
presence, hm?

05:43.500 --> 05:44.540
Do I?

05:44.540 --> 05:46.120
Honestly Eva,
sometimes I question

05:46.120 --> 05:47.580
the FÃ¼hrer's election
of you.

05:55.670 --> 05:57.290
Ah, she's seized
our weapons

05:57.290 --> 05:59.210
but left the rest of
our equipment.

05:59.210 --> 06:03.870
And all that remains
is useless.

06:03.870 --> 06:06.120
This is not useless.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.830
The thousand words
contained within one image,

06:08.830 --> 06:11.000

of empires.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.580
What does that
even mean?

06:12.580 --> 06:13.870
You brought that for
a reason.

06:13.870 --> 06:15.170
Yes.

06:15.170 --> 06:18.670
The long histories of my work.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.710
Time for a little
demonstration.

[speaks German]

06:24.420 --> 06:26.000
Stefan, come help here.

06:30.210 --> 06:31.870
Why so quiet professor?

06:31.870 --> 06:36.920
I was thinking about how
I should thank you.

06:36.920 --> 06:38.830
Ah, for bringing
you on the

06:38.830 --> 06:42.790
greatest adventure of
your life, huh?

06:42.790 --> 06:45.420
For keeping Catherine out
of this goddamn mess.

06:46.750 --> 06:47.870
Ah.

06:47.870 --> 06:50.210
[speaking German]

06:56.540 --> 06:59.250
From now on,
I'm in charge.

06:59.250 --> 07:02.830
And here I thought you've been
in charge this whole time.

07:02.830 --> 07:04.500
The kid was your idea.

07:04.500 --> 07:07.330
That is my finger
you're bending.

07:07.330 --> 07:09.960
Sorry, thought it
was Beal's.

07:09.960 --> 07:11.920
Is anybody here not
hostile?

07:11.920 --> 07:14.960
Even we are fighting,
I say no.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.330
You don't think I can get
us out of this mess.

07:17.330 --> 07:19.000
Did I say that?

07:19.000 --> 07:20.370
Wasif, did I say--

07:20.370 --> 07:22.290
[Wasif] I have no opinion.

07:22.290 --> 07:25.580
I suggest we all
remain calm.

07:25.580 --> 07:28.170
And let the solution
present itself.

07:30.330 --> 07:31.540
[commands in Ancient Egyptian]

07:34.790 --> 07:36.210
Sit tight and wait?

07:36.210 --> 07:38.170
He's worse than you!

07:38.170 --> 07:39.420
Worse than me?

07:39.420 --> 07:41.330
You have no plan,
nothing.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.210
So we escape,
then what?

07:43.210 --> 07:45.330
They still have
our guns.

07:45.330 --> 07:47.080
We take them back
obviously.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.620
Obviously.

07:48.620 --> 07:51.210
Look!

07:51.210 --> 07:52.210
I'm next, I'm next!

07:52.210 --> 07:55.540
Shh, not so loud!

07:59.500 --> 08:00.870
Don't tell me
what to do.

08:00.870 --> 08:02.370
