00:44.753 --> 00:46.504
Freedom!

00:46.588 --> 00:49.174
Welcome to the Twinkletown Insane Asylum.

00:49.257 --> 00:50.759
Your new home.

00:55.096 --> 00:57.390
I don't believe
we've met before. I'm Chazzzzz.

00:57.474 --> 01:01.019
It's very pleasant here
except for the psycho ward.

01:01.102 --> 01:03.646
Ooh, boy!
You don't want to end up in there.

01:03.730 --> 01:06.608
That's where I live.
I can't believe they ever let me out.

01:08.193 --> 01:12.072
We've got you in a nice cozy little room
with your very own bucket.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.865
And your roommate will be…

01:17.577 --> 01:18.745
Ooh!

01:18.828 --> 01:20.246
This will be good.

01:20.872 --> 01:22.207
Get in there, boy.

01:22.290 --> 01:23.666
I'm sorry, that was rude.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.336
I mean, right this way, Your Majesty.

01:30.590 --> 01:33.843
Oops. I almost forgot,
King Zøg, meet Giggles.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.804
Giggles, be nice.

01:36.971 --> 01:38.014
- Huh?

01:45.021 --> 01:46.272
You both still alive?

01:47.023 --> 01:48.149
I'll come back later.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.210
Good morning, screwballs.

02:07.293 --> 02:11.256
Okay, Zøg, it's time for you
to have your first therapy session.

02:12.590 --> 02:15.426
The head doctor
will chazz your head real good.

02:15.510 --> 02:19.264
It's gonna be you, isn't it?
You're gonna be the guy, aren't you?

02:19.347 --> 02:22.142
Look at you, talking in full sentences.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.018
This place is helping you already.

02:24.102 --> 02:24.936
Wait here.

02:26.896 --> 02:27.730
Come in.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.525
Hey, Zøg. You can go right in.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.153
- What are you looking at?

02:36.614 --> 02:37.782
Here we go.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.367
- Chazzzzz!

02:39.450 --> 02:42.287
Welcome. Come in. Zøg, is it?

02:42.370 --> 02:44.289
- I'm Dr. Fulton.
- Chazzzzz!

02:44.372 --> 02:46.416
How many times have I told you
not to sit at my desk?

02:46.499 --> 02:48.042
It's more shock therapy for you.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.336
- Ha! I like shock therapy.
- Get out!

02:50.420 --> 02:52.046
- See you in the cafeteria.
- What?

02:52.130 --> 02:53.882
- It's Taco Tuesday.
- Very well.

02:54.674 --> 02:57.218
Welcome. Come in. Zøg, is it?

02:57.302 --> 02:59.596
I'm Dr. Fulton. I mean, Mulberry.

02:59.679 --> 03:00.930
Dr. Fulton is dead.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.766
My, what a limp handshake.

03:03.850 --> 03:06.269
Why don't you drag
a chair over here and have a seat.

03:06.352 --> 03:08.396
Attaboy. You're a strong one.

03:09.063 --> 03:11.441
Confidentially, they
call this place an insane asylum,

03:11.524 --> 03:14.527
but to be honest,
that's dated and derogatory.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.780
I like to think of it
as more of a loony bin.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.282
Wait, that's offensive, too.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.951
How about a bughouse? No. Booby hatch?

03:22.035 --> 03:23.620
Funny farm? Laughing academy?

03:23.703 --> 03:25.330
I could go on, but you get the point.

03:25.413 --> 03:28.333
Tutti-frutti whack-shack.
How does that make you feel?

03:28.416 --> 03:30.835
<i>Rancho delos nutos?</i>

03:32.503 --> 03:34.339
Don't interrupt! Bozo's bunkhouse.

03:34.422 --> 03:37.133
The panic pit. Yo-yo inspection unit.

03:37.216 --> 03:38.718
Stop it! You're making me nuts!

03:38.801 --> 03:40.553
Very good. Our time is up for today.

03:42.513 --> 03:45.558
Did you see
Dr. Chazzzzz in there? He's dreamy.

04:04.619 --> 04:08.456
After tacos, the inmates are free
to roam the courtyard till lights-out.

04:08.539 --> 04:10.708
- Lights out!

04:16.881 --> 04:18.007
What are you doing?

04:18.091 --> 04:20.260
Your chalk outline's over there.

04:23.429 --> 04:24.639
Honk quieter.

04:26.224 --> 04:27.642
That's too quiet.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.944
Giggles? Giggles, you up?

04:38.027 --> 04:40.029
I'm always awake, King-a-ling.

04:40.113 --> 04:43.032
Er, Giggles, you ever miss your family?

04:43.116 --> 04:46.536
Sure. I regret what I done to them.
What about you?

04:46.619 --> 04:49.122
Some of 'em, yeah, a lot.

04:49.622 --> 04:54.252
Bean, Derek, Oona, Freckles.

04:54.335 --> 04:55.712
I don't miss Dagmar.

04:55.795 --> 04:59.132
I don't miss uncle Clayton.
He struggled too much.

04:59.215 --> 05:01.926
Hey, Zøg. Do you struggle too much?

05:03.011 --> 05:05.388
Don't worry, there's no right answer.

05:42.508 --> 05:46.596
No. Don't bury me alive.

05:48.556 --> 05:50.600
I ain't no corpse.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.479
At least toss a sandwich in here.

05:55.396 --> 05:56.773
Hold the mustard.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.693
I can't keep dying like this.

06:03.029 --> 06:06.949
Afraid of the old
premature burial, huh?

06:26.260 --> 06:29.347
We're talking about
our fears and things.

06:29.430 --> 06:30.932
Whoo!

06:31.641 --> 06:35.728
- Yeah, keep on honkin', Zøg.

06:37.730 --> 06:38.773
Welcome. Come in.

06:38.856 --> 06:41.442
Zøg, is it? I'm Dr. Bronson. I…

06:41.526 --> 06:43.611
I mean, Pullman. I mean, Mulberry.

06:43.694 --> 06:44.946
Dr. Fenster is dead.

06:45.029 --> 06:48.950
- Uh… Yeah. We met yesterday.
- Ah! Wonderful.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.701
Step over to the crazy couch.

06:53.162 --> 06:54.539
Feel free to lie down.

06:55.039 --> 06:56.124
No, the other way.

06:56.874 --> 06:57.834
No, face up.

06:58.709 --> 06:59.627
There you go.

07:00.503 --> 07:04.465
What I like to do with my new patients
is start out by playing a little game.

07:04.549 --> 07:05.383
Do you like games?

07:05.466 --> 07:06.801
- Uh, not really.
- Good.

07:06.884 --> 07:10.138
I say a phrase, then you say
the first thing that comes to mind.

07:10.221 --> 07:12.181
Got it? Okay. Here we go.

07:12.265 --> 07:16.602
When I wake up in the morning,
the thing I most fear is…

07:16.686 --> 07:19.147
- Nothin'. I ain't afraid of nothin'.
- Mmm.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.316
For breakfast, I like to eat…

07:22.400 --> 07:24.735
Oatmeal. Cornflakes are too scary.

07:25.611 --> 07:28.906
Then as I start my day,
my biggest challenge is…

07:28.990 --> 07:30.408
Buttoning my pants.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.162
And the people
I encounter each day want me…

07:34.245 --> 07:35.496
- Dead.
- Mmm.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.833
And they are going to kill me by…

07:38.916 --> 07:40.751
Poisoning me, shooting me,

07:40.835 --> 07:43.546
shovin' me down the stairs,
feedin' me to the crabs.

07:43.629 --> 07:46.841
I've had these
delusional paranoid fantasies for…

07:46.924 --> 07:49.927
Ever. But, ah, I ain't paranoid, Doc.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.555
Really. Everyone is out to get me.

07:52.638 --> 07:55.266
Ooh! And sometimes, I hear voices.

07:55.349 --> 07:56.225
Hmm. I see.

07:56.851 --> 07:57.768
Let's go on.

07:57.852 --> 08:02.064
Being confined in this asylum
for the rest of my life makes me feel…

08:02.148 --> 08:03.983
What are you talking about?

08:04.066 --> 08:06.569
The realization that
I'll never ever, ever, ever,

08:06.652 --> 08:09.363
ever leave the asylum
till I die makes me feel…

08:09.447 --> 08:12.533
Never ever leave the asylum till I die?

08:12.617 --> 08:14.660
You can't tell me what to do!

08:14.744 --> 08:17.121
I'm King! I control everything!

08:17.205 --> 08:19.749
I don't die until I say I die.

08:19.832 --> 08:22.210
But you're gonna die! Come here, you!

08:22.293 --> 08:24.545
Chazzzzz, Giggles, get in here!

08:24.629 --> 08:25.796
Zøg's flipping out!

08:26.964 --> 08:28.132
You go high, I'll go low.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.305
Welcome to the rubber room.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.270
Look at him bounce.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.564
Bouncy, bouncy. I'll do the sound effects.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.574
Excellent. I'll check back
in the morning. Carry on.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.016
I can't
take it no more, Giggles.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.309
I got to get out of here.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.186
You can escape from here.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.233
But you can never escape from here.

09:27.316 --> 09:29.068
Look at me, I'm perfectly normal,

09:29.151 --> 09:32.071
then I killed everyone in my family
except for my grandma.

09:32.154 --> 09:34.198
Then I escaped, and I killed my grandma.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.951
I dug my way out of this joint
with my grandma's skull.

09:37.034 --> 09:39.245
- It's good for scooping.
- Wait a minute, Giggles.

09:39.328 --> 09:41.205
You just said, you killed your grandma,

09:41.289 --> 09:43.499
then you said you used
your grandma's skull

09:43.583 --> 09:45.876
to dig your way out of here
to kill your grandma.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.044
How's that possible?

09:47.128 --> 09:48.629
Guy can have two grandmas.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.131
I gotta get out of here.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.346
Hand me that candle, will ya?

09:58.681 --> 10:00.766
The hell?
This tunnel only goes a few feet.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.979
Oh! Did I forget to mention
there was a cave-in?

10:05.062 --> 10:06.272
- Huh?
- You know,

10:06.355 --> 10:08.149
that thing you were
talking about in your sleep.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.484
- What?
- Being buried alive.

10:10.568 --> 10:13.112
Yeah, it's happening to you right now.

10:18.617 --> 10:20.286
Oh! Not again.

10:20.369 --> 10:23.080
This is my worst death ever. Help!

10:24.248 --> 10:25.458
Help!

10:27.668 --> 10:31.756
Help!

10:31.839 --> 10:34.133
- I hear shouting.
- It sounds familiar.

10:34.216 --> 10:35.551
Very deep and gravelly.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.679
Aw! That poor building's crying for help.

10:38.763 --> 10:42.016
Jerry, if we stop at every building
that yells at us, we'll never get home.

10:42.099 --> 10:45.353
Just because you're beautiful
doesn't mean you get to be mean.

10:45.436 --> 10:46.520
Exactly.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.190
Help!

10:53.194 --> 10:56.906
I'm gonna die alone.
No one's gonna even know.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.699
- I'll know.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.326
And will you do me a favor?

11:00.409 --> 11:03.871
When you die,
could you leave your skull on the shelf?

11:05.373 --> 11:08.793
Oh! Grandma's skull. Grandma's skull?

11:17.635 --> 11:18.552
Hey…

11:20.179 --> 11:22.682
You're okay, Zøg. You're okay.

11:22.765 --> 11:25.810
You're diggin' your way out of
a nuthouse with an old lady's head…

11:26.560 --> 11:27.603
You're okay.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.313
Not honkin' or nothin'.

11:29.397 --> 11:33.359
Just like this skull fragment,
my life is in my hands.

11:33.442 --> 11:37.113
I'm having a breakthrough,
and I'm about to break through.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.948
Hey, are you dead in there yet?

11:39.031 --> 11:41.283
No, Giggles. I ain't dead.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.536
And I ain't afraid no more.

11:50.709 --> 11:52.837
I can't believe you think I'm cruel.

11:52.920 --> 11:56.215
- I didn't say cruel, I said mean.
- And stubborn, too.

11:56.298 --> 11:58.134
- And a little stuck-up.
- Argh!

12:00.261 --> 12:01.887
Hey, looky there.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.223
A poor horsey's stuck up on that mountain.

12:04.306 --> 12:05.307
We should save it.

12:05.391 --> 12:09.019
Forget it. Not with
Princess Meanie Beanie at the wheel.

12:09.103 --> 12:11.731
Set grasping claw to horse.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.320
No, no. Arma-what-o?

12:18.863 --> 12:20.197
Ooh! That's the one!

12:23.951 --> 12:26.245
- Okay, lower it down.
- Faster.

12:26.328 --> 12:29.540
- No, that's terrible advice, Luci.
- Well, go diagonal at least.

12:29.623 --> 12:32.793
You can't 'cause it's
only up or down or left or right.

12:32.877 --> 12:35.087
They say diagonal is the move.

12:35.171 --> 12:39.091
Once you go diagonal,
you never go… biagonal.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.803
If I could go biagonal or diagonal,
I would, but I can't

12:42.887 --> 12:45.306
because it just goes
one direction in either side.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.724
This is boring. Can you hurry up?

12:46.807 --> 12:48.934
I'm trying, but you're talking so loudly.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.603
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

12:50.686 --> 12:54.356
Claw opens, and then… Got it.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.943
Oh, crap. I think I killed it.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.236
All right, let's move out, y'all.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.489
No, wait, it's still alive.
It just jerked.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.240
Okay, repositioning.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.910
Okay, and upwards.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.788
Now leftwards then centerwards.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.289
He's doin' it. He's got it.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.336
- Yay!
- Yes!

13:15.419 --> 13:18.672
- You're the best, Uncle Bean.
- That's right, guys.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.591
Who's hateful and heartless now?

13:22.009 --> 13:24.595
- Hey, it's Laughing Horse.
- God damn it.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.558
Yay!

13:29.642 --> 13:32.478
- Everybody, shut up.
- Yes! Bean's mad.

13:42.279 --> 13:43.864
Midnight roll call.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.824
- Giggles?

13:46.450 --> 13:48.035
- Here.
- Check.

13:48.118 --> 13:51.455
Zøg? Zøg? Zøg?

13:52.706 --> 13:56.627
Oh, no. Chazzzzz has been chazzed.

14:18.732 --> 14:22.027
Ain't nothing gonna stop me. I'm free!

14:22.111 --> 14:24.196
Free as an abandoned baby!

14:28.951 --> 14:31.704
Wait a minute, I ain't free. I'm freezin'.

14:40.129 --> 14:44.550
It is a good thing they have taken
a vow of silence because… wow.

14:45.342 --> 14:50.055
Wow!

14:50.639 --> 14:55.185
Er… Yeah, but I'm real sorry
to burst in on Your Holiness,

14:55.269 --> 14:57.646
- but, see, I'm a king and--

14:57.730 --> 15:00.190
Titles shackle you to the material world.

15:00.274 --> 15:01.650
We don't use them here.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.902
I am the Venerable Rinsemaster,

15:03.986 --> 15:05.946
brother of the late Washmaster.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.449
He was a jerk, but he was my brother.

15:08.532 --> 15:11.368
Yeah, see, guy, I've been lost.

15:11.452 --> 15:14.496
I've been lost my whole life,
but now I'm really lost.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.832
And I got this weird feeling in my head…

15:16.915 --> 15:18.292
Just a second.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.546
Sorry,
that's a spider from the tunnel.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.882
I hope she didn't lay eggs in there.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.842
But anyway, can you help me--

15:26.925 --> 15:29.094
- Find yourself?
- Yeah!

15:29.178 --> 15:31.847
Well, where was the last place you looked?

15:32.348 --> 15:33.182
Huh?

15:33.766 --> 15:35.601
That's a monk joke.

15:35.684 --> 15:36.977
The monk joke.

15:37.061 --> 15:40.105
There is only one, and it is perfect.

15:40.689 --> 15:42.524
I don't get that highfalutin humor.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.027
I'm more into broad physical comedy.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.238
Like when you pull the lever,
and the guy falls through the trapdoor.

15:48.322 --> 15:50.949
And the punchline is, he says, "Oh, no,"

15:51.033 --> 15:53.369
with a little self-pitying laugh
on the way down.

15:55.454 --> 15:59.166
The first step is to rid yourself
of worldly attachments.

15:59.249 --> 16:01.460
Now, hand over your leather coin pouch.

16:01.543 --> 16:02.878
What are you, some kind of wise guy?

16:02.962 --> 16:05.673
Just kidding. That's the other monk joke.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.716
The second step is to shed your vanity.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.513
This is my cousin, the Shavemaster.

16:13.597 --> 16:14.765
Big Jo?

16:14.848 --> 16:16.517
At your service, King Zøg.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.518
What will it be today?

16:17.601 --> 16:20.604
The cue ball, the snow globe or the Porky?

16:21.271 --> 16:23.065
Ah…

16:23.148 --> 16:24.441
The cue ball, I guess.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.902
See, Porky? No one ever chooses you.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.742
Sorry, my head's kind of lumpy.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.578
- I've fallen down a lot of stairs.
- Indeed.

16:36.662 --> 16:39.623
Now, hold still.
I don't want to nick your throat

16:40.124 --> 16:41.709
I thought you were shavin' my head.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.085
Oh, right.

16:44.169 --> 16:45.462
This is your room

16:45.546 --> 16:48.799
where you will contemplate
the universe and your place within it.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.050
Sounds lonely.

16:50.134 --> 16:52.886
You've never been to
a monastery before, have you?

17:01.061 --> 17:04.481
Dear, one true God,
brother of the other God,

17:04.565 --> 17:07.443
I hope you exist 'cause otherwise…

17:07.526 --> 17:09.778
What, are you
trying to make a jerk out of me?

17:09.862 --> 17:12.072
Anyway, can you keep a secret?

17:12.573 --> 17:14.783
Told your pal,
the Rinsemaster, I was lost,

17:14.867 --> 17:16.535
hoping he would give me a map,

17:16.618 --> 17:18.537
but all I got was my head shaved.

17:18.620 --> 17:21.248
I guess I'm on a spiritual path now.

17:21.331 --> 17:23.876
I'll stay here
and go along with the program

17:23.959 --> 17:27.379
as long as you don't let 'em
put me back in the insane asylum.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.714
So think about it.

17:28.797 --> 17:30.924
I'm going to go now.

17:31.008 --> 17:34.053
Guess I'll see you here tomorrow,
same time, same box.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.804
Okay, bye.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.307
Your friend, Zøg.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.809
Oh, yeah. Amen.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.352
Don't worry, Porky.

17:42.436 --> 17:46.732
Rumor has it that the Lord
only answers every 25th prayer.

17:46.815 --> 17:48.442
So those are pretty good odds.

17:48.525 --> 17:51.528
We'll get him under the cloak of darkness
when God's asleep.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.948
Look, boys, Dreamland.
Home sweet home.

17:55.532 --> 17:56.658
That reminds me, Bean,

17:56.742 --> 17:59.203
the last time you came home
they shot you down.

17:59.286 --> 18:00.370
- Yeah. I do.
- Remember, Bean?

18:00.454 --> 18:02.706
- Come on, you remember that, right?
- Right.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.208
- They thought you were a witch.
- Mmm-hmm.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.834
- Then they put us on trial.
- I know.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.878
- They found us guilty, remember?
- I was there.

18:07.961 --> 18:10.964
And then they tied us to a stake,
and then they burned us alive.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.257
- That's enough.
- Don't you remember?

18:12.341 --> 18:15.594
Thank you! Well, this time
I'll make sure they know it's me.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.266
Attention, Dreamland!

18:21.350 --> 18:24.812
It's me, your mighty queen, Bean.

18:24.895 --> 18:26.480
Are you ready to welcome us?

18:28.232 --> 18:30.234
Oh! Look out. Flaming arrows.

18:30.317 --> 18:31.443
What the hell?

18:31.527 --> 18:33.320
They're aiming
right for your forehead, Elfo.

18:33.403 --> 18:36.949
Just lean towards
the windshield, just a skosh.

18:38.033 --> 18:40.494
Don't worry. There's no way
they can hit us from this high up.

18:52.005 --> 18:54.508
- Abandon ship!
- Way ahead of ya.

18:54.591 --> 18:56.009
Slide into the escape pod, dummies.

19:11.191 --> 19:15.696
Brother Zøg, you have advanced rapidly
from levels one through nine.

19:15.779 --> 19:18.365
And of course, we appreciate
your generous financial pledge.

19:18.448 --> 19:22.452
The old barn out back is now
the Zøg Center for Outstanding Humility.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.830
Money don't mean that much to me no more.

19:24.913 --> 19:27.624
I've given up everything but masturbation.

19:27.708 --> 19:31.044
Oh! You can't give that up.
Look what happened to Big Jo.

19:31.128 --> 19:34.798
- Eh. What about the other guy?
- Porky? That's a whole other story.

19:34.882 --> 19:38.468
Now, this is our holiest room.

19:38.552 --> 19:39.970
You can tell by the candles.

19:40.053 --> 19:41.221
Please be seated.

19:41.972 --> 19:43.515
Move over a couple of inches.

19:44.057 --> 19:47.686
You're now sitting
in the very center of the known world.

19:47.769 --> 19:50.272
I'm sorry, one more inch. There you go.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.900
- And now, you're ready.
- For what?

19:52.983 --> 19:55.194
- Less asking, more trusting.
- Mmm.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.820
- Less sweating, more bathing.
- Hmm.

19:56.904 --> 19:59.114
- Less yelling, more loving.
- Oh!

19:59.197 --> 20:01.116
- Less pie, more vegetables.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.076
- Less honking, more hugging.
- Ah!

20:03.160 --> 20:05.662
- Less hurting, more helping.
- Mmm!

20:08.290 --> 20:11.168
Wait, is there any final bit
of eternal wisdom?

20:11.251 --> 20:12.753
I don't know, look for a sign.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.130
Oh!

20:15.839 --> 20:16.924
Oh!

20:17.633 --> 20:19.551
Om…

20:30.812 --> 20:32.481
Lord, it's me again.

20:32.564 --> 20:36.860
I appreciate you're trying your best,
but I just want to say,

20:36.944 --> 20:41.657
you're the one who made me loud
and large and gave me big fat hands.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.243
But now, I'm not that guy.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.578
I don't know who I am,

20:46.662 --> 20:49.998
but if you could just show me
the path forward.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.170
A bean?

20:55.754 --> 20:57.798
A single bean?

20:57.881 --> 21:00.801
Wait, a bean, and it's single.

21:00.884 --> 21:03.262
And my Bean? And she's single.

21:03.345 --> 21:04.596
My kids!

21:04.680 --> 21:07.265
Bean! Derek! Do I got any others?

21:07.349 --> 21:09.309
No, that's it. Well, Freckles.

21:09.393 --> 21:13.272
What am I doing here trying to
save myself when they're in danger?

21:13.355 --> 21:17.609
I'm not afraid of dying
'cause kids, I would die for you!

21:19.486 --> 21:21.363
Er… I'm still hungry, but I got to go.

21:23.865 --> 21:26.660
Hey, Rinsemaster, you was right.

21:26.743 --> 21:28.328
I'm more enlightened now.

21:28.412 --> 21:31.540
Hi, I'm Chazzzzz. We're from
the insane asylum down the road.

21:31.623 --> 21:34.042
We got a crazy
on the loose, and it's not me.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.293
Have you seen this man?

21:37.504 --> 21:38.380
He's not here.

21:38.463 --> 21:39.298
Phew!

21:39.965 --> 21:42.009
But we can't go back empty-handed.

21:42.092 --> 21:43.385
You're right, Dr. Chazzzzz.

21:43.468 --> 21:44.970
What about that guy?

21:45.053 --> 21:46.596
You go low, I go lower.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.724
No! What are you doing?

21:48.807 --> 21:50.392
Keep your greasy mitts off me!

21:50.475 --> 21:52.728
Sorry, we've been eating carnitas.

21:52.811 --> 21:55.814
Help! Porky! Porky!

21:55.897 --> 21:57.399
Where are you, Porky?

21:57.482 --> 21:59.651
Porky, help!

21:59.735 --> 22:01.153
Land over there.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.280
No, over there.

22:03.363 --> 22:05.407
Shut up! I'm the blimp queen.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.951
- Go, go up!
- No, down!

22:08.035 --> 22:08.869
Faster!

22:08.952 --> 22:10.787
- Don't listen to him.
- Go left.

22:10.871 --> 22:13.206
Bean, honestly, please,
just listen to me. Okay?

22:13.290 --> 22:17.294
I have over 10,000 hours of flying kites.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.463
- Maybe I will crash us.

22:19.546 --> 22:21.506
Exit stage right.

22:25.969 --> 22:27.262
Set her down by this cave.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.139
Ease her in.

22:29.723 --> 22:30.682
Easy.

22:31.475 --> 22:33.351
Ten more feet to the left.

22:34.644 --> 22:36.313
Got it, and…

22:38.440 --> 22:40.108
Perfect.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.027
Quick, hide this thing.

22:42.110 --> 22:44.029
Yes, sir, Uncle Blimp Queen.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.868
Thanks for
not being a squealer, Your Holiness.

22:49.951 --> 22:52.746
And thanks for showing me the true path.

22:52.829 --> 22:55.832
Ah! Yes, it is right over there.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.627
- Mind if I give you a final platitude?
- Yeah.

22:58.710 --> 23:02.756
The journey of a thousand miles
begins with a single kick.

23:02.839 --> 23:03.757
Ow!

23:24.069 --> 23:27.614
Vip! Oh, and Vap!
What are you two doing here?

23:30.367 --> 23:32.994
Ooh! What are you guys doing?
Making a bear trap?

23:34.871 --> 23:37.416
Oh, jeez. My cape…

23:38.917 --> 23:40.001
and my crown.

23:40.502 --> 23:42.170
It still fits!

23:43.380 --> 23:45.215
Aw! Thanks, guys.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.640
You know what? Climb on.

23:54.558 --> 23:55.434
Heh-heh.

23:55.517 --> 23:58.645
Now, which way is Dreamland? This way?
