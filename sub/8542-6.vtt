00:10.140 --> 00:11.315
[sighing]

00:13.578 --> 00:16.277
Victim's the local chief
of police. Marnie Green.

00:16.364 --> 00:18.714
Shot twice in the chest,
once in the head.

00:18.801 --> 00:21.499
Trucker found the body,
called it in just after 5:00.

00:21.586 --> 00:23.936
First responder was a, uh,
officer from her department.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.199
Where is he?

00:25.286 --> 00:27.114
Just over here.
Clarence Price.

00:27.201 --> 00:30.247
Agent Lisbon with the CBI.
My condolences.

00:30.334 --> 00:33.033
Any idea what the chief was
doing out here last night?

00:33.120 --> 00:35.209
No, ma'am.
Weren't any calls on the radio.

00:35.296 --> 00:37.602
'Does she have family
around here?'

00:37.689 --> 00:40.040
Chief lived alone.
Worked pretty much 24/7.

00:40.127 --> 00:42.346
[voice breaking]
Truly a good-hearted person.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.133
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.570
- We can do this later.
- No, I'm fine, really.

00:48.657 --> 00:50.354
Were there any casings?

00:50.441 --> 00:52.269
Uh, one, from a .380.

00:52.356 --> 00:54.576
One? But she was
shot three times.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.534
Got people looking
for the others.

00:59.885 --> 01:01.061
Alright.

01:02.323 --> 01:04.586
[police radio chatter]

01:04.673 --> 01:07.371
[Wayne]
What kind of crimes do you
usually see around here?

01:07.458 --> 01:09.112
There's some drugs
going through the valley..

01:09.199 --> 01:10.548
..uh, meth, coke

01:10.635 --> 01:12.507
but we deal mostly
with vacationers.

01:12.594 --> 01:15.205
Tourists at the resorts
for spa vacations and such.

01:15.292 --> 01:16.728
[Wayne]
'Could be road rage.'

01:16.815 --> 01:18.252
'Chief gets into a tangle'

01:18.339 --> 01:20.515
there's an accident,
driver's got an attitude, a gun.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.691
- Maybe.
- Not likely.

01:22.778 --> 01:24.910
What are you doing?

01:24.997 --> 01:28.000
I'm checking
the chief's height.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.568
She's about five or six inches
shorter than I am.

01:30.655 --> 01:33.963
The driver's seat is set back
for someone at least my height.

01:34.050 --> 01:36.183
Maybe she was
in the passenger seat.

01:36.270 --> 01:38.446
Passenger air bag didn't go off.
Seat was empty.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.404
So where was she?

01:41.362 --> 01:42.885
[rattling]

01:51.459 --> 01:52.721
Ahh.

01:53.765 --> 01:55.071
[Wayne]
'Blood.'

01:56.725 --> 01:59.206
So she was shot
somewhere else

01:59.293 --> 02:01.730
killer thought she was dead,
put her in the trunk.

02:01.817 --> 02:05.908
But she's alive,
and she opens the escape latch

02:05.995 --> 02:07.388
trunk pops open

02:07.475 --> 02:08.998
killer's startled,
he crashes the car.

02:09.085 --> 02:10.695
She gets out of the trunk

02:10.782 --> 02:13.220
killer shoots her
in the head here.

02:13.307 --> 02:15.700
She's not in a uniform,
so she came from home.

02:15.787 --> 02:16.788
Voila.

02:33.414 --> 02:35.764
You start inside.
I'll look around the property.

03:01.790 --> 03:03.095
[clearing throat]

03:06.577 --> 03:08.275
[door opening]

03:08.362 --> 03:09.754
CBI. Don't move.

03:09.841 --> 03:11.060
Whoa! Take it easy.

03:11.147 --> 03:12.888
On your knees.
Hands on your head.

03:12.975 --> 03:15.717
- No problem.
- Do it now.

03:15.804 --> 03:17.022
[girl #1]
'Leave him alone!'

03:17.109 --> 03:18.763
[man #1]
'Annie, put that down!'

03:18.850 --> 03:20.287
Everybody stay calm.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.376
Damn it,
I told you to stay put!

03:22.463 --> 03:25.553
- Now put that down!
- I mean it. Drop it!

03:25.640 --> 03:26.945
Annie, do what I said!

03:27.032 --> 03:28.643
Listen to him.

03:28.730 --> 03:30.601
[Teresa]
What's the hell's
going on?

03:33.474 --> 03:36.085
- Tommy?
- Teresa?

03:36.172 --> 03:38.957
- Annabeth?
- Annie.

03:39.044 --> 03:41.351
- What are you doing here?
- What're youdoing here?

03:41.438 --> 03:45.094
- Wait, you know these people?
- This is my brother Tommy.

03:45.181 --> 03:48.228
- Hey, how's it going?
- And my niece Annabeth.

03:48.315 --> 03:51.448
Annie. It's Annie.
No one calls me Annabeth.

03:51.535 --> 03:53.494
Put the gun..
Put the gun down.

03:53.581 --> 03:55.626
Put it down.

03:55.713 --> 03:58.412
I swear to god, Rees,
I told her to stay outside.

04:01.284 --> 04:04.200
[theme music]

04:12.208 --> 04:13.731
[Teresa]
You could have killed somebody
or gotten killed.

04:13.818 --> 04:15.255
- Hey, it's a tough business.
- Hey, quit that.

04:15.342 --> 04:18.040
She knows not to touch
the guns in the field.

04:18.127 --> 04:20.260
- In the field?
- Not ever.

04:20.347 --> 04:23.001
Jeez. Sorry for trying
to help out.

04:23.088 --> 04:24.264
[sighing]

04:26.004 --> 04:27.963
She is sorry.
She just won't admit it.

04:28.050 --> 04:29.965
[chuckling]
Who's that remind you of?

04:30.052 --> 04:31.706
What the hell is going on?

04:31.793 --> 04:33.490
Why are you here?
What're you doing?

04:33.577 --> 04:35.013
I'm looking for a skip..

04:35.100 --> 04:36.537
A fugitive,
someone who skipped bail.

04:36.624 --> 04:38.103
I know what a skip is.

04:38.190 --> 04:40.062
Since when are you
a bounty hunter?

04:40.149 --> 04:41.585
I'm a bail enforcement agent.

04:41.672 --> 04:43.152
When I saw you last year

04:43.239 --> 04:45.850
you were building decks
with Eddie Duncan.

04:45.937 --> 04:49.114
Well, nobody wants a deck when
the bank's at the door, Rees.

04:49.201 --> 04:52.379
I took a course in April.
Tig Muldoon, Margo's cousin?

04:52.466 --> 04:54.468
He's a bondsman.
He gave me a shot.

04:54.555 --> 04:57.079
I brought in six guys
in the past two months

04:57.166 --> 04:58.559
made, like, four grand.

04:58.646 --> 04:59.908
Tommy, Tommy..

04:59.995 --> 05:01.692
- Don't even start.
- With what?

05:01.779 --> 05:04.304
Busting my chops
like you always do.

05:04.391 --> 05:05.653
Well, you don't.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.872
I know what I'm doing.
I'm a professional.

05:07.959 --> 05:09.352
Oh, right.

05:09.439 --> 05:10.875
Taking your 13-year-old
daughter along..

05:10.962 --> 05:12.094
that's very professional.

05:12.181 --> 05:13.922
She's 14

05:14.009 --> 05:17.012
and that's not fair, because
I did not want to bring her.

05:17.099 --> 05:19.362
My psycho ex went to Miami
with her boyfriend

05:19.449 --> 05:21.625
so I got her.

05:21.712 --> 05:23.714
[sighing]
You look good.

05:23.801 --> 05:26.151
You...do something
with your hair?

05:26.238 --> 05:29.981
You should be encouraging me.
I'm trying here.

05:30.068 --> 05:32.157
[scoffing]

05:32.244 --> 05:34.682
Okay. What's the name
of your fugitive?

05:34.769 --> 05:38.076
His name's Carmine O'Brien.
Jumped bail out of St. Louis.

05:38.163 --> 05:41.384
I found out about three days ago
he bought a bus ticket here

05:41.471 --> 05:43.038
so I called this Chief Green

05:43.125 --> 05:45.823
and I asked her to keep
an eye out for him.

05:45.910 --> 05:48.086
I heard on my scanner
she got shot.

05:48.173 --> 05:52.003
So you think the chief found
O'Brien and then he killed her?

05:52.090 --> 05:54.484
- Yeah, I don't know, maybe.
- Why break into her house?

05:54.571 --> 05:56.486
Door was open.

05:56.573 --> 05:59.620
I just went in to find out
what I could about O'Brien.

05:59.707 --> 06:01.883
Okay. When we pick him up,
I'll tell you.

06:01.970 --> 06:05.452
If he had any part in this
murder, I can't give him to you.

06:05.539 --> 06:07.410
What if I get to him first?

06:07.497 --> 06:10.239
- Yeah, right.
- You don't think I can do it?

06:10.326 --> 06:13.373
- No, I don't.
- Fine. We'll see.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.418
- Can you watch Annie?
- Are you kidding?

06:15.505 --> 06:17.115
No. No.

06:17.202 --> 06:19.509
This is really dangerous work
I'm doing.

06:19.596 --> 06:22.251
Your office is a lot safer
than my van, right?

06:22.338 --> 06:24.688
'Besides, she needs
some female time.'

06:24.775 --> 06:27.169
Her mom's such a freaking
wackadoo, and you know

06:27.256 --> 06:29.040
I'm a guy.

06:31.347 --> 06:33.784
- Damn it, Tommy.
- Annie!

06:33.871 --> 06:36.047
'You're spending the day
with your Aunt Teresa!'

06:36.134 --> 06:38.398
- 'Come on! Get your bag!'
- Cool.

06:38.485 --> 06:42.576
It is on,sis.
May the best man win.

06:45.622 --> 06:46.928
Oh, man.

06:50.322 --> 06:52.020
Hey.

06:52.107 --> 06:54.849
Carmine O'Brien
is an accountant from St. Louis.

06:54.936 --> 06:57.068
He was arrested three months
ago for embezzlement

06:57.155 --> 06:59.114
'skipped town
right before the trial.'

06:59.201 --> 07:01.464
Spent summers
growing up in Fairmont.

07:01.551 --> 07:03.118
Might explain
why he's hiding here.

07:03.205 --> 07:04.598
Any history of violence?

07:04.685 --> 07:06.295
No. Strictly white collar.

07:06.382 --> 07:07.644
Ivy League-educated,
no prior arrests.

07:07.731 --> 07:09.951
It's hard to see
this guy shooting a cop.

07:10.038 --> 07:11.518
Doesn't mean he didn't do it.

07:11.605 --> 07:13.781
Have Cho go back to Fairmont
and ask around.

07:13.868 --> 07:15.565
Run his credit card
and phone records

07:15.652 --> 07:17.088
have Rigsby
put out a bolo.

07:17.175 --> 07:18.350
Alright.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.876
- OfficerPrice. Hi.
- Hi.

07:21.963 --> 07:23.486
'Can I help you?'

07:23.573 --> 07:25.532
I felt bad about
not checking that trunk.

07:25.619 --> 07:27.577
Should have caught
that, so, uh..

07:27.664 --> 07:30.232
...I went through
the chief's files.

07:30.319 --> 07:32.756
She pulled over a DUI
day before yesterday..

07:32.843 --> 07:34.105
Russian guy
named Dmitri Zubov.

07:34.192 --> 07:35.890
He's staying at one
of the resorts.

07:35.977 --> 07:37.457
What about him
caught your eye?

07:37.544 --> 07:39.937
He blew a .076
on a breathalyzer.

07:40.024 --> 07:41.765
.76? That's under the limit.

07:41.852 --> 07:44.028
He wasn't drunk, but the chief
arrested him anyway

07:44.115 --> 07:47.118
which is a waste of time,
'cause once it goes to court

07:47.205 --> 07:49.686
the judge is just
gonna throw it out.

07:49.773 --> 07:51.819
She was a real stickler
for details.

07:51.906 --> 07:53.777
Thanks.
We'll check it out.

07:57.564 --> 07:59.740
I want to help out
any way I can.

07:59.827 --> 08:01.437
I know the locals

08:01.524 --> 08:03.221
and I can help out
with interviews.

08:03.308 --> 08:05.223
We'll let you know.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.707
Two fingers.
Just dip and remove.

08:10.794 --> 08:12.927
No hesitation.
Want to give it a try?

08:13.014 --> 08:14.189
Okay.

08:18.062 --> 08:19.934
- Did you feel that?
- Well, just slightly.

08:20.021 --> 08:23.546
- Did you feel that?
- You're good.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.940
Picking pockets. Nice.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.245
I promised I'd show her

08:27.332 --> 08:29.378
if she'd tell me
her Aunty Rees stories.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.293
- Don't you dare.
- Of course not.

08:31.380 --> 08:32.947
I was just stringing him along.

08:33.034 --> 08:35.689
You were, were you?
I guess I won't give you this.

08:35.776 --> 08:38.082
- Hey.
- Annabeth?

08:38.169 --> 08:39.649
- Annie.
- Annie.

08:39.736 --> 08:41.912
Annie,Jane and I
have to go to work.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.435
Mind hanging out
in my office?

08:43.523 --> 08:45.263
Sure.

08:45.350 --> 08:48.876
Rigsby's a nice, easy mark
if you want to keep practicing.

08:50.312 --> 08:52.532
The DUI, Zubov?
He's an economist.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.795
He's in Fairmont for
some sort of trade conference.

08:54.882 --> 08:56.579
He stayed on for vacation.

08:56.666 --> 08:59.103
Fascinating, but not what
you really want to talk about.

08:59.190 --> 09:01.715
I cannot believe
my brother's a bounty hunter.

09:01.802 --> 09:04.195
All of a sudden
he's some sort of tough guy?

09:04.282 --> 09:05.240
Who is he fooling?

09:05.327 --> 09:06.807
Not you.

09:06.894 --> 09:09.157
You know what bugs me?
He didn't tell me.

09:09.244 --> 09:11.202
I'd have told him
it's a bad idea.

09:11.289 --> 09:13.683
He just had to
pick up the phone

09:13.770 --> 09:15.250
but instead, nothing.

09:15.337 --> 09:17.295
I basically raised
that punk and his brothers.

09:17.382 --> 09:19.297
It's not my fault
if he doesn't communicate.

09:19.384 --> 09:20.429
[elevator bell dinging]

09:20.516 --> 09:22.039
You think it ismy fault.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.085
No, I didn't say that.
You said that.

09:24.172 --> 09:26.609
I say live and let live.
You'll all be happier.

09:26.696 --> 09:28.568
Oh, mind your own business.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.701
Last name O'Brien,
first name Carmine.

09:31.788 --> 09:33.485
Gonna e-mail you a picture
right now.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.227
Let me know if there's any hits.
Thanks. Bye.

09:36.314 --> 09:37.751
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:37.838 --> 09:39.970
You just called in
a bolo for O'Brien, right?

09:40.057 --> 09:41.363
Yep.

09:41.450 --> 09:42.973
Nice.

09:43.060 --> 09:45.759
[keyboard keys clacking]

09:45.846 --> 09:48.152
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

09:48.239 --> 09:51.242
Your Sig Sauer, is that a .357,
a .40, or the 9-millimeter?

09:51.329 --> 09:53.331
It's a 9-millimeter.

09:53.418 --> 09:55.377
Great gun.

09:55.464 --> 09:56.596
Thank you.

09:56.683 --> 09:57.684
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey.

09:57.771 --> 09:59.207
Forensics just came back.

09:59.294 --> 10:00.948
No prints off
Chief Green's cruiser.

10:01.035 --> 10:02.863
Killer must have wiped the car.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.126
You got anything
on O'Brien's family in his file?

10:05.213 --> 10:09.478
Uh, his parents are dead.
He's an only child.

10:09.565 --> 10:12.046
If you're looking for leads,
should check the ex-girlfriend.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.787
They have a kid together.

10:13.874 --> 10:16.877
Alright. Thanks.
We'll look into it.

10:16.964 --> 10:18.661
No problem.

10:21.229 --> 10:25.102
- So do you have a girlfriend?
- Yes, I do, as it happens.

10:25.189 --> 10:27.888
- Are you in love with her?
- Oh, good question.

10:27.975 --> 10:29.585
It's hard to say.
I mean..

10:29.672 --> 10:31.892
Is she cute?

10:31.979 --> 10:34.808
You know, maybe you should wait
in your Aunt Teresa's office.

10:39.856 --> 10:41.641
Hey..

10:41.728 --> 10:42.859
[sighing]

10:48.952 --> 10:51.607
[Teresa]
'Mr. Zubov, tell us
about your arrest.'

10:51.694 --> 10:54.131
'I stand charged with a crime
I did not commit.'

10:54.218 --> 10:56.873
Chief Green insisted
I was drunk.

10:56.960 --> 11:00.834
I was not, but she would not
listen to reason.

11:00.921 --> 11:03.619
Did you have any contact with
Chief Green after your arrest?

11:03.706 --> 11:05.403
Can get you something
to drink?

11:05.490 --> 11:07.536
- It's very hot.
- No, thank you, Mr. Zubov.

11:07.623 --> 11:09.451
Just answer the question,
please.

11:09.538 --> 11:12.236
No.
No contact with Chief Green.

11:12.323 --> 11:14.282
'And where were you
last night?'

11:14.369 --> 11:17.764
Last night I had something
to eat, I had a drink.

11:17.851 --> 11:21.724
I had a little more to drink,
but, uh, heh, no driving.

11:21.811 --> 11:24.118
[woman #1]
'Mr. Zubov?'

11:24.205 --> 11:25.641
Are you ready
for your massage?

11:25.728 --> 11:27.643
A new girl. Hello.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.037
Duty calls. Am I done?

11:30.124 --> 11:31.560
Mr. Zubov's gonna
have to reschedule.

11:31.647 --> 11:33.344
Of course.

11:33.431 --> 11:35.085
Now it's all very clear.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.827
You're quite the, uh,
sex fiend, aren't you?

11:37.914 --> 11:39.829
[chuckling]
What do you mean?

11:39.916 --> 11:42.266
Well, you automatically tried
to seduce Agent Lisbon here

11:42.353 --> 11:45.008
but it was the masseuse that
really got your blood pumping.

11:45.095 --> 11:47.271
You're like an owl
watching a mouse.

11:47.358 --> 11:48.838
No. I'm not.

11:48.925 --> 11:50.622
Chief Green thought
you'd committed a crime

11:50.710 --> 11:53.887
but it wasn't drunk driving,
was it? What was it, I wonder?

11:53.974 --> 11:55.671
- This is ridiculous.
- No.

11:55.758 --> 11:58.674
You know what's ridiculous?
Is this. This, uh, ascot..

11:58.761 --> 12:00.589
- Give me this back.
- That's ridiculous. No.

12:00.676 --> 12:02.069
You mind sharing with us

12:02.156 --> 12:04.854
how you got those scratches
on your neck?

12:04.941 --> 12:06.726
I was hiking and boom..
I fell.

12:06.813 --> 12:07.988
[chuckling]

12:08.075 --> 12:09.467
Hiking.

12:09.554 --> 12:10.860
Really?

12:10.947 --> 12:13.036
Yes, hiking.

12:13.123 --> 12:15.996
I refuse to
discuss this further.

12:18.999 --> 12:22.002
Now all we have to do is find
the woman he assaulted.

12:22.089 --> 12:25.353
Well, she's reluctant to make
a public accusation.

12:25.440 --> 12:29.226
That's why, uh, chief hung
the DUI on Zubov.

12:29.313 --> 12:31.751
To buy time to convince
the victim to testify.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.665
It fits.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.756
Butwithout an actual victim,
we don't have anything.

12:36.843 --> 12:39.280
I can't even get
a search warrant for his room.

12:39.367 --> 12:40.934
Zubov's an opportunist.

12:41.021 --> 12:44.154
The question is,
where did he have opportunity?

12:44.241 --> 12:45.155
[knocking]

12:45.242 --> 12:46.461
CBI.

12:46.548 --> 12:49.507
Chad Carmichael,
operations manager here.

12:49.594 --> 12:51.379
What I can I do for you?

12:51.466 --> 12:54.208
We're investigating a crime that
relates to one of your guests

12:54.295 --> 12:55.470
Dmitri Zubov.

12:55.557 --> 12:57.951
Oh. What did he do?

12:58.038 --> 13:01.215
We're not at liberty to say,
but what we're gonna need is

13:01.302 --> 13:04.044
a list of your staff who've
been in Mr. Zubov's room

13:04.131 --> 13:05.785
and security camera
footage

13:05.872 --> 13:07.525
from the hallway
outside his door.

13:07.612 --> 13:11.747
Uh, that's problematic.
Mr. Zubov is a valued guest.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.444
It's cold in here.

13:13.531 --> 13:16.708
Is-is that your, uh,
own personal air conditioner?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.362
Uh, yes.

13:18.449 --> 13:21.191
Fancy. A place like this
doesn't have central air?

13:22.540 --> 13:24.847
I guess I just like it cold.

13:24.934 --> 13:27.328
What's going on here?

13:27.415 --> 13:28.895
[sighing]
Dad.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.592
This is my father,
Philip Carmichael.

13:30.679 --> 13:33.247
- 'He owns the resort.'
- Government people, are you?

13:33.334 --> 13:34.944
These people are with CBI.

13:35.031 --> 13:38.295
They need information
about a guest.

13:38.382 --> 13:41.081
And you didn't call me?

13:41.168 --> 13:43.170
It is myjob.
I'm handling it.

13:43.257 --> 13:44.867
[Philip clearing throat]

13:44.954 --> 13:47.652
We're happy to assist
law enforcement at any time.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.393
We just need a search warrant.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.483
I can't give you the details,
but Mr. Zubov may be involved

13:52.570 --> 13:56.270
in the murder of Chief Green.
This is extremely important.

13:56.357 --> 13:58.228
- Oh, my god. Really?
- And I sympathize.

13:58.315 --> 14:01.144
But we have to respect
the privacy of our guests.

14:01.231 --> 14:04.974
Son, show them out.
And next time, call.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.896
Does the old tyrant always
talk to you like that?

14:15.680 --> 14:19.119
So you're thinking maybe
Zubov killed Chief Green?

14:19.206 --> 14:22.165
Yes, possibly.

14:22.252 --> 14:24.211
I'll get the video for you.
Wait here.

14:24.298 --> 14:25.647
Thank you, chad.

14:25.734 --> 14:28.171
Not easy with a father like
that, but thank you.

14:28.258 --> 14:29.825
Appreciate it.

14:33.350 --> 14:34.830
[door opening]

14:35.962 --> 14:37.180
Mmm.

14:37.267 --> 14:39.139
- 'You still in Fairmont?'
- Yeah.

14:39.226 --> 14:41.532
Go to 787 Elm Street.
O'Brien's there right now.

14:41.619 --> 14:43.056
How'd you get the address?

14:43.143 --> 14:45.362
His ex has been getting calls
from a cell.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.625
We accessed that cell's GPS
and pulled the location.

14:47.712 --> 14:49.018
Got it.

15:02.075 --> 15:04.251
O'Brien!

15:04.338 --> 15:06.079
O'Brien! CBI! Don't move!

15:07.254 --> 15:08.385
Hey!

15:10.953 --> 15:12.172
[car horn honking]

15:12.259 --> 15:13.390
[tires screeching]

15:15.392 --> 15:17.264
[gasping]

15:20.658 --> 15:23.313
[groaning]
Ow!

15:23.400 --> 15:25.098
You okay?

15:28.188 --> 15:30.494
[panting]

15:35.891 --> 15:38.459
It's either a sprained muscle in
your back or a ruptured disc.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.374
They'll tell you
at the hospital.

15:40.461 --> 15:42.202
- I'm fine.
- Go to the hospital!

15:42.289 --> 15:43.333
[cellphone ringing]

15:43.420 --> 15:45.857
- Yeah, okay.
- What's up?

15:45.945 --> 15:47.685
'I've been going through
the security footage'

15:47.772 --> 15:50.950
and I may have found
the woman Zubov assaulted.

15:51.037 --> 15:54.736
It's a maid. She's crying,
and her uniform is torn.

15:54.823 --> 15:58.087
Work schedule says her name
is Sofia Chavez.

15:58.174 --> 16:00.698
Alright. Bring her in.

16:00.785 --> 16:03.136
- How's your guy?
- He's hurt pretty bad.

16:03.223 --> 16:05.616
- Yeah, looked pretty rough.
- You shouldn't have been here.

16:05.703 --> 16:07.749
I told you I was
going after O'Brien.

16:07.836 --> 16:09.794
I mean, stuff happens
when you're chasing guys.

16:09.881 --> 16:12.014
It could have been me
that got knocked.

16:12.101 --> 16:13.798
Your daughter got shot
this morning

16:13.885 --> 16:15.583
I've got a guy
in the hospital

16:15.670 --> 16:17.367
because you don't know
what you're doing.

16:17.454 --> 16:19.413
Oh, like hell, I don't.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.502
You know how I got O'Brien?

16:21.589 --> 16:24.026
He's a Type 1 Diabetic,
and I paid the pharmacist

16:24.113 --> 16:26.289
to tell me when he comes
to buy insulin.

16:26.376 --> 16:28.596
That's skill.
Your people think of that?

16:28.683 --> 16:30.902
Somebody could have
gotten killed.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.166
I love you, but..

16:33.253 --> 16:35.037
"I love you, but.."
But what, sis?

16:35.124 --> 16:38.214
"But...you're a loser. You'll
always be a loser. Just quit."

16:38.301 --> 16:41.304
I love you, but you and Annabeth
need to go home.

16:41.391 --> 16:44.090
Tommy, you should think
about going back to school

16:44.177 --> 16:47.006
learn a trade.
You always liked electronics.

16:47.093 --> 16:50.270
Okay, sure.
Trade school it is.

16:50.357 --> 16:54.361
You want me to detail your car
for you before I go?

16:54.448 --> 16:55.927
Agent Lisbon,
we've set up roadblocks

16:56.015 --> 16:57.973
and we're sending officers
to look for O'Brien.

16:58.060 --> 17:01.759
- 'You want to talk to 'em?'
- We'll finish this later.

17:07.983 --> 17:09.854
I have nothing to say.

17:09.941 --> 17:12.205
I go in room,
I clean, I leave.

17:12.292 --> 17:13.684
Wait.

17:13.771 --> 17:16.644
Zubov didn't assault you?
Didn't hurt you?

17:16.731 --> 17:17.862
No.

17:19.777 --> 17:23.390
Sofia, I don't work
for immigration.

17:23.477 --> 17:26.349
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
I promise.

17:29.613 --> 17:32.268
So this is just us?

17:32.355 --> 17:33.661
No police?

17:35.271 --> 17:36.403
No.

17:36.490 --> 17:37.839
Just us.

17:39.710 --> 17:42.539
[sighing]
I clean room.

17:42.626 --> 17:45.455
I think I alone.

17:45.542 --> 17:48.676
He come out of bathroom.

17:48.763 --> 17:51.113
He put hand on me. He..

17:51.200 --> 17:54.943
He rip my, um, this.

17:55.030 --> 17:59.121
- He ripped your uniform.
- Yes.

17:59.208 --> 18:01.036
I scared. I run for door.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.647
He grab me.

18:03.734 --> 18:06.389
I fight.

18:06.476 --> 18:08.565
I get out.

18:08.652 --> 18:10.524
Who told Chief Green
about it?

18:12.221 --> 18:14.571
I told.

18:14.658 --> 18:18.358
She was my friend.

18:18.445 --> 18:24.103
She tell me to accuse Zubov,
but I say no.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.888
She say she keep him
until I change my mind..

18:29.717 --> 18:31.588
...but I no change.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.985
He kill her?

18:37.072 --> 18:39.248
It's a possibility.

18:39.335 --> 18:43.383
That's why it's so important
for you to come forward.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.907
Why?

18:45.994 --> 18:48.692
The rich, they get away
with everything.

18:52.087 --> 18:54.002
[sighing]

18:54.089 --> 18:55.873
Any luck finding O'Brien?

18:55.960 --> 18:58.180
- Look--
- We're leaving tomorrow.

18:58.267 --> 19:01.270
Maybe you're right. Maybe
I'm not cut out for this.

19:01.357 --> 19:02.837
Really?

19:02.924 --> 19:05.144
Yeah, really. What business
do I have bounty hunting?

19:05.231 --> 19:07.929
Truth is, it's not the first
time I thought about quitting.

19:08.016 --> 19:10.236
- Tommy..
- It's probably for the best.

19:10.323 --> 19:12.890
Annabeth will dismember me if we
leave without saying good-bye.

19:12.977 --> 19:14.544
You want to
get lunch tomorrow?

19:14.631 --> 19:16.981
Sure. Yeah.

19:17.068 --> 19:18.983
[door opening]

19:20.855 --> 19:22.465
[man #2]
'This is absurd.'

19:22.552 --> 19:25.120
There is no victim of
an assault. Where is she?

19:25.207 --> 19:27.557
Well, there is a victim.
Sofia Chavez.

19:27.644 --> 19:30.256
Victim? Please.

19:30.343 --> 19:32.171
I ask her to touch me--

19:32.258 --> 19:33.998
- Dmitri..
- It's okay. It's okay.

19:34.085 --> 19:36.914
I ask. She refuses.
That's all.

19:37.001 --> 19:38.786
I only ask her

19:38.873 --> 19:41.528
because my masseuse that day
was little bit ugly, you know?

19:41.615 --> 19:44.487
I see. And normally
you assault your masseuse?

19:44.574 --> 19:47.838
[scoffing]
You make it sound so crude.

19:47.925 --> 19:52.016
I love women.
And love is beautiful, no?

19:52.103 --> 19:53.931
Alright. You have
no case here, agent.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.411
Unless there's
anything else...

19:55.498 --> 19:57.239
Mr. Zubov, we checked
the security footage.

19:57.326 --> 19:59.067
You weren't back
until after 12:00

19:59.154 --> 20:00.634
the night of
Chief Green's murder.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.679
- Where were you?
- You don't have to answer.

20:02.766 --> 20:05.682
We'll find out where you were.
It's just a question of time.

20:08.598 --> 20:10.470
[speaking indistinctly]

20:12.559 --> 20:14.648
I went to Chief Green's home.

20:14.735 --> 20:17.041
- Son of a bitch.
- To discuss my arrest.

20:17.128 --> 20:19.000
To see if something
could be done.

20:19.087 --> 20:21.872
[chuckling]
It's starting to become
a bit tedious here.

20:21.959 --> 20:23.613
You went to bribe her?

20:23.700 --> 20:26.573
I was hoping to find a mutual
acceptable resolution.

20:26.660 --> 20:29.445
But a friend
of the chief's arrives.

20:29.532 --> 20:30.968
A big woman.

20:31.055 --> 20:34.102
Uh, Jori. Jori,
I think her name was.

20:34.189 --> 20:38.062
She was upset.
About what, I don't know.

20:38.149 --> 20:40.413
- And I left.
- Jori?

20:40.500 --> 20:42.197
Must be Jori Kasser.

20:42.284 --> 20:45.374
Uh, the Russian was with
Chief Green when I got there

20:45.461 --> 20:47.071
but he left right away.

20:47.158 --> 20:49.857
What were you doing that late
at the chief's house?

20:49.944 --> 20:51.728
Chief Green
had left a message.

20:51.815 --> 20:53.774
Wanted to know
where my son Steven was.

20:53.861 --> 20:56.646
You know why
she was looking for him?

20:56.733 --> 20:58.169
Steven has
some drug problems.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.954
Knows a bit about
Fairmont's seedy side.

21:00.041 --> 21:02.739
Chief would go to him for
information from time to time.

21:02.826 --> 21:04.306
Chief Green said
that a fugitive

21:04.393 --> 21:06.090
might be hiding out
in Fairmont

21:06.177 --> 21:08.876
and wanted to know if Steven
had heard anything about him.

21:08.963 --> 21:11.531
Why not call?
Why go in person?

21:11.618 --> 21:13.315
I needed to ask a favor.

21:13.402 --> 21:17.450
Um, I'd overheard Steven say

21:17.537 --> 21:20.931
that he was going up
to a cabin in the woods.

21:21.018 --> 21:23.543
'I know what he does there.
He buys drugs.'

21:23.630 --> 21:27.286
And I asked the chief,
if that was what he was doing

21:27.373 --> 21:29.070
to get him
into a treatment program.

21:29.157 --> 21:30.637
He really wants to get clean.

21:30.724 --> 21:32.987
We need to speak to your son.
Where's he?

21:33.074 --> 21:37.905
[sighing]
That's the thing.

21:37.992 --> 21:40.690
I haven't heard from Steven
since I talked to the chief.

21:40.777 --> 21:43.606
Steve's missing?

21:43.693 --> 21:46.305
Why didn't you say
anything?

21:46.392 --> 21:49.003
I was hoping
it was a coincidence.

21:49.090 --> 21:50.961
Sometimes he disappears.

21:52.920 --> 21:55.139
Do you think your son
had something to do

21:55.226 --> 21:57.098
with the murder
of Chief Green?

21:58.534 --> 22:00.841
[voice breaking]
No, not if he was sober.

22:03.974 --> 22:06.020
Hey, boss.
Jori Kasser says her son

22:06.107 --> 22:07.630
might've been involved
in the murder.

22:07.717 --> 22:09.893
Apparently he was buying drugs
up at some cabin.

22:09.980 --> 22:12.243
- Gonna check it out.
- Call my cell if anything.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.071
I'm gonna be out of the office.

22:14.158 --> 22:16.422
- Anything on Zubov?
- Yeah, Van Pelt's on it.

22:17.771 --> 22:20.121
- Yeah, thanks.
- Problem?

22:20.208 --> 22:23.951
M.E. puts the time of death
between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m.

22:24.038 --> 22:25.996
Zubov was in his room
from midnight on.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.216
- He couldn't be the killer.
- Mm.

22:28.303 --> 22:29.739
He was a non-starter anyhow.

22:29.826 --> 22:32.089
And Sofia Chavez
won't testify against him.

22:32.176 --> 22:33.613
We can't even touch
the scumbag.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.963
The world's full of scumbags
we can't touch.

22:36.050 --> 22:37.704
I know, I know.
It's just..

22:37.791 --> 22:40.315
I hear you. It'd soothe
your troubled soul

22:40.402 --> 22:43.144
if you could just stick it
to this particular scumbag.

22:43.231 --> 22:46.147
Well, yeah. I guess
it kind of would.

22:46.234 --> 22:47.975
Shall we?

22:53.023 --> 22:54.285
[car door closing]

22:54.373 --> 22:55.983
They're, uh, rental cabins
for vacationers.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.072
But they're being
renovated now.

22:58.159 --> 23:01.031
Pretty isolated.
Get many drug buys up here?

23:01.118 --> 23:03.033
Heard rumors there were.

23:03.120 --> 23:06.080
Hard to imagine Steve
hanging out in these parts.

23:06.167 --> 23:08.125
He's not what you'd call
a country boy.

23:08.212 --> 23:10.084
That pile of leaves there.

23:13.217 --> 23:15.089
Who's raking leaves up here?

23:19.180 --> 23:20.355
Phew!

23:22.575 --> 23:25.447
[sighing and sniffling]

23:31.410 --> 23:33.847
Steve Kasser?

23:33.934 --> 23:36.458
I better call his mother.

23:36.545 --> 23:38.242
Yeah.

23:38.329 --> 23:41.202
[indistinct conversation]

23:51.952 --> 23:53.867
Mr. Zubov?

23:53.954 --> 23:56.086
Are you ready
for your massage?

23:56.173 --> 23:57.610
Ah, very nice.

23:57.697 --> 23:59.699
Yes, please.
Uh, lead the way.

24:13.190 --> 24:15.932
[cellphone ringing]

24:16.019 --> 24:17.194
Hmm.

24:17.281 --> 24:20.154
[ringing continues]

24:20.241 --> 24:22.025
Rigsby. What's the word?

24:22.112 --> 24:23.505
Lisbon's not answering
her phone.

24:23.592 --> 24:26.160
- Any idea where she is?
- Nope.

24:26.247 --> 24:28.423
We got another vic
dead by a rental cabin.

24:28.510 --> 24:29.772
Maybe connected
to Chief Green.

24:29.859 --> 24:31.600
- Drug thing, looks like.
- Cocaine?

24:31.687 --> 24:33.689
Yeah. Victim had
about five grams on him.

24:33.776 --> 24:35.604
Hmm. Is there just
one cabin

24:35.691 --> 24:37.650
or are others nearby?

24:37.737 --> 24:38.694
There's a few.

24:38.781 --> 24:40.217
[clattering]

24:40.304 --> 24:42.045
[Zubov yelling indistinctly]

24:42.132 --> 24:44.874
[Zubov]
'I-I made a mistake!
I didn't know that..'

24:44.961 --> 24:47.181
Uh, gotta go.
I'll see you up there later.

24:47.268 --> 24:50.445
- 'If I knew..'
- What?

24:50.532 --> 24:52.969
[Van Pelt]
You're under arrest
for solicitation

24:53.056 --> 24:54.928
sexual assault,
assault on a police officer..

24:55.015 --> 24:56.190
Wait, please..

24:56.277 --> 24:57.844
You've the right
to remain silent.

24:57.931 --> 25:00.455
Anything you say can and will
be used against you

25:00.542 --> 25:01.761
in a court of law.

25:01.848 --> 25:04.241
[gunshots]

25:09.072 --> 25:11.510
Nice shooting.

25:11.597 --> 25:14.077
I practice a lot
on the gun range with dad.

25:15.992 --> 25:18.212
It's good that you spend time
with your dad

25:18.299 --> 25:20.649
'but you should do other
stuff too. Kid stuff.'

25:20.736 --> 25:22.912
Why? I already know
what I wanna do.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.261
Really? What's that?

25:24.348 --> 25:27.308
I wanna be a cop.
Like you.

25:27.395 --> 25:28.788
I'm flattered. I am.

25:28.875 --> 25:31.312
I don't think you really
know what you want yet.

25:31.399 --> 25:32.966
You don't have to.
It's okay.

25:33.053 --> 25:35.882
- Yeah, I do.
- I sleep five hours a night.

25:35.969 --> 25:39.189
I haven't been able to get away
to see you and your dad

25:39.276 --> 25:42.279
and your uncles in over a year.
That's not what you want.

25:42.366 --> 25:44.978
Aunt Teresa, you get paid
to carry a Glock.

25:45.065 --> 25:47.546
You beat up people
when they get out of line.

25:47.633 --> 25:52.028
- You're totally badass.
- My point still stands.

25:52.115 --> 25:53.290
Come on.

25:53.377 --> 25:55.945
Come on. Come on.

26:02.865 --> 26:04.824
You got a text
while you were gone.

26:04.911 --> 26:06.434
- I did?
- Yeah.

26:06.521 --> 26:08.392
- How'd you do?
- I kicked butt.

26:08.479 --> 26:10.220
Yes, she did.

26:11.657 --> 26:14.703
I gotta go back to work.

26:14.790 --> 26:17.097
- Already?
- Yeah.

26:22.537 --> 26:23.756
Keep in touch.

26:23.843 --> 26:25.279
Absolutely, Rees.

26:25.366 --> 26:27.890
I'll call you
when I learn that trade.

26:27.977 --> 26:29.457
- Bye.
- Bye.

26:29.544 --> 26:31.198
[buttons beeping]

26:32.373 --> 26:34.897
Hey, Rigs.
I got your text.

26:34.984 --> 26:37.334
'Did you find Steve Kasser?'

26:37.421 --> 26:39.206
Yeah, he's been dead
a couple days.

26:39.293 --> 26:42.165
'Damn. That's a shame.
Did the coroner show up?'

26:42.252 --> 26:44.124
'Nope. They should be soon.'

26:49.477 --> 26:50.870
[Wayne]
'Those are exit wounds.'

26:50.957 --> 26:52.219
'Steve was shot twice.
Killer used a .380.'

26:52.306 --> 26:54.047
- Same caliber as Chief Green.
- Yeah.

26:54.134 --> 26:56.702
There's more blood over there.
Chief Green's, I'm betting.

26:56.789 --> 26:59.139
So Chief Green comes here
looking for Steve.

26:59.226 --> 27:01.445
Steve's buying coke
from a dealer.

27:01.532 --> 27:02.751
The dealer sees the chief

27:02.838 --> 27:04.797
freaks out and kills
both her and Steve.

27:04.884 --> 27:06.799
He dumps Chief Green
in her police cruiser

27:06.886 --> 27:08.278
and hides Steve here.

27:08.365 --> 27:09.802
Makes sense,
but that scenario

27:09.889 --> 27:11.847
pretty much eliminates
O'Brien as a suspect.

27:11.934 --> 27:14.371
And whatever an Ivy League
accountant was doing in town

27:14.458 --> 27:15.764
he wasn't doing coke.

27:15.851 --> 27:17.461
So he's not the killer.

27:17.548 --> 27:18.811
Why is Philip Carmichael here?

27:18.898 --> 27:21.509
'He owns the cabins.
He's here to let us in.'

27:21.596 --> 27:23.293
Give a yell
if you need anything.

27:23.380 --> 27:24.555
- Okay.
- Have you seen Jane?

27:24.643 --> 27:26.557
Says he'll be up here later.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.332
[unzipping bag]

28:40.544 --> 28:42.024
Will this take long?

28:42.111 --> 28:44.244
It'll take as long
as it takes.

28:44.331 --> 28:46.333
Hey, check it out.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.857
- Someone was staying here.
- Yeah. Recently.

28:48.944 --> 28:50.554
Lot of sugar-free stuff.

28:50.641 --> 28:52.252
O'Brien was a diabetic.

28:52.339 --> 28:54.776
- He could have been here.
- How'd he end up here?

28:54.863 --> 28:57.300
Well, a lot of people knew
these cabins were empty.

28:57.387 --> 29:00.477
Not a bad place
to hide out.

29:00.564 --> 29:02.001
You think he witnessed
the murders?

29:02.088 --> 29:03.219
Maybe.

29:04.133 --> 29:05.569
'Maybe.'

29:05.656 --> 29:09.356
Question is,
where is he now?

29:13.186 --> 29:14.927
But the roadblocks
are still up, right?

29:15.014 --> 29:17.930
Let us know
if you get a hit.

29:18.017 --> 29:19.453
Nothing on O'Brien
from the airport

29:19.540 --> 29:21.629
bus station,
or the train station.

29:21.716 --> 29:23.631
Hey. Welcome back.

29:25.546 --> 29:28.157
[Wayne]
'Doctors say what
the problem is?'

29:28.244 --> 29:30.638
Yeah.
I got hit by a car.

29:30.725 --> 29:32.379
Cho. Good to have you back.

29:32.466 --> 29:33.467
[exhaling]
Thanks.

29:33.554 --> 29:35.338
I got a call from a ranger.

29:35.425 --> 29:37.906
He spotted a man driving down
Black Canyon Fire Road

29:37.993 --> 29:39.429
thirty miles
outside of Fairmont.

29:39.516 --> 29:41.736
'Caucasian, male,
50s, grey hair..'

29:41.823 --> 29:44.260
Sounds like O'Brien.
We're on it.

29:44.347 --> 29:46.828
Uh, Van Pelt, why don't
you go with Rigsby?

29:55.228 --> 29:59.841
Uh, about a mile up ahead
turn right onto the fire road.

29:59.928 --> 30:01.103
Okay.

30:03.932 --> 30:05.716
Lisbon's niece,
sharp girl.

30:05.804 --> 30:09.546
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah. Good questions.

30:09.633 --> 30:11.287
- Yeah.
- Do you love her?

30:11.374 --> 30:13.246
What, Annabeth?

30:13.333 --> 30:16.466
- Your girlfriend Sarah.
- Oh, right.

30:16.553 --> 30:20.557
- So?
- I don't see why it matters.

30:20.644 --> 30:21.820
Uh-oh.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.647
Look, we have
a good time together

30:23.734 --> 30:26.433
we enjoy each other's company,
I look forward to seeing her.

30:26.520 --> 30:28.217
Isn't that enough?
Why worry about it?

30:28.304 --> 30:31.090
Trust me,
she's worrying about it.

30:31.177 --> 30:33.570
[sighing]
I just think if you start
talking like that

30:33.657 --> 30:35.398
you're gonna get hurt.

30:39.489 --> 30:41.840
I'm not sure I even know
what that means.

30:41.927 --> 30:44.843
"I love you."
What does that say, really?

30:44.930 --> 30:47.933
I don't know, Wayne.

30:48.020 --> 30:50.152
My last relationship
didn't exactly end well.

30:50.239 --> 30:54.678
I'm probably not the best
person to ask right now.

30:54.765 --> 30:56.680
Fair enough.

30:57.943 --> 30:59.683
There's your right.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.213
[Wayne]
'What the hell!'

31:07.300 --> 31:08.910
[brakes squealing]

31:09.563 --> 31:10.956
Tommy!

31:11.043 --> 31:13.828
Put the gun away, Tommy.
Put the weapon away.

31:13.915 --> 31:15.047
Holster it!

31:22.097 --> 31:24.404
Uh, who are you now?

31:35.023 --> 31:36.720
Hey, what's going on?

31:36.807 --> 31:39.114
O'Brien won't tell us
what he witnessed.

31:39.201 --> 31:41.203
His lawyer won't be here
for a while.

31:41.290 --> 31:43.945
Let him stew. But he's a runner.
Keep him on lockdown.

31:44.032 --> 31:46.034
Okay.

31:46.121 --> 31:47.993
Boss? They just put him
in your office.

32:01.049 --> 32:02.529
I know how you got O'Brien.

32:02.616 --> 32:05.924
The tech guys did
a diagnostic on my phone.

32:06.011 --> 32:07.795
You downloaded spyware

32:07.882 --> 32:09.536
so you could listen
to my conversations.

32:09.623 --> 32:11.755
Sorry.

32:11.842 --> 32:14.889
You couldn't get him yourself,
so you piggybacked on us.

32:14.976 --> 32:18.980
[sighing]
I'm broke, Rees.

32:19.067 --> 32:21.940
Alimony, rent,
friggin' eighth grade prom.

32:22.027 --> 32:24.290
Can you even believe
they have that?

32:24.377 --> 32:25.726
I needed this guy.

32:25.813 --> 32:28.163
So you lied
and cheated your own sister.

32:28.250 --> 32:31.601
I'd really appreciate it
if you give him to me.

32:31.688 --> 32:35.083
- Are you out of your mind?
- I need a favor.

32:35.170 --> 32:38.086
Do you think I'd give you
O'Brien after what you pulled?

32:38.173 --> 32:40.871
Not to mention the fact
that he might be a witness.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.917
Do you even know
how hard this is?

32:43.004 --> 32:45.920
Okay, I am doing you a favor
by not arresting you.

32:46.007 --> 32:49.228
Now go do something
different with your life.

32:49.315 --> 32:51.491
No, you don't tell me
how to live.

32:51.578 --> 32:52.622
Tommy, come on.

32:52.709 --> 32:54.189
I bust my ass every day

32:54.276 --> 32:57.801
to put food on the table
for me and my kid by myself.

32:57.888 --> 33:00.761
Hey, maybe I haven't done
quite as well as you have

33:00.848 --> 33:02.806
but I'm doing
the best that I can

33:02.893 --> 33:04.808
so don't tell me
how to live.

33:18.213 --> 33:19.693
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me. Sorry.

33:19.780 --> 33:21.521
Sorry about that.

33:30.921 --> 33:32.053
Hello.

33:35.143 --> 33:36.362
[elevator bell dinging]

33:36.449 --> 33:38.842
- Where are we going?
- Uh, Tommy.

33:38.929 --> 33:41.584
- Here's O'Brien, he's yours.
- What?

33:41.671 --> 33:44.587
Go get your bounty.
But you have to leave right now.

33:44.674 --> 33:46.894
Excuse me. I'm very confused.
What is going on?

33:46.981 --> 33:49.114
Annie...pick her up
at the Ellington Inn.

33:49.201 --> 33:52.204
- Isn't she at the motel?
- No, I got her a spa package..

33:52.291 --> 33:54.119
...facial, massage, the works.
She'll be waiting.

33:54.206 --> 33:57.122
- How do you know my daughter?
- Give her my best.

34:02.127 --> 34:03.606
Lisbon.

34:03.693 --> 34:05.652
Are you sure we can't get
O'Brien's public..

34:05.739 --> 34:06.870
- Lisbon.
- ...here any sooner?

34:06.957 --> 34:08.568
No, I..

34:08.655 --> 34:10.613
- What're you doing?
- We've to leave now.

34:10.700 --> 34:13.138
- I need to talk to O'Brien.
- That might be difficult.

34:13.225 --> 34:14.965
- He's not in the building.
- Why not?

34:15.053 --> 34:17.011
Uh, I'll explain to you
on the road.

34:17.098 --> 34:19.448
- I know a great shortcut.
- Where to?

34:22.321 --> 34:24.758
Chad, it's Agent Lisbon
from the CBI.

34:24.845 --> 34:26.281
We need your help.

34:26.368 --> 34:27.935
Yeah, sure, of course.

34:28.022 --> 34:30.503
There's a bounty hunter
on his way to your hotel

34:30.590 --> 34:33.636
to pick up his daughter.
He's traveling with a fugitive.

34:33.723 --> 34:35.421
Wait, that guy
squatting in our cabin?

34:35.508 --> 34:37.118
- My dad was just mentioning--
- Listen..

34:37.205 --> 34:39.164
...tell your father
to get security.

34:39.251 --> 34:41.601
Detain him. We'll be there
in 20 minutes.

34:56.398 --> 34:58.313
[inhaling sharply]

34:58.400 --> 35:00.881
Well, that was
very well played.

35:03.884 --> 35:06.234
- Where is he?
- Give it a minute.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.980
[Patrick]
'Ah-ha! There he is.'

35:14.068 --> 35:15.722
If anything happens to him..

35:15.809 --> 35:18.768
'Everyone's safe,
so don't worry.'

35:18.855 --> 35:21.684
It's all gonna turn out fine.

35:28.691 --> 35:29.866
Shall we?

35:41.226 --> 35:43.315
- You're the bounty hunter.
- Excuse me?

35:43.402 --> 35:45.273
This is about your bounty.

35:46.970 --> 35:48.363
[under breath]
Oh, man.

35:54.543 --> 35:56.415
Hey, I don't have time.

35:56.502 --> 35:59.200
Listen, I just need you
to take O'Brien to Mexico

35:59.287 --> 36:01.028
and let him loose.

36:01.115 --> 36:03.291
You do that, I'll double
whatever they're paying you.

36:03.378 --> 36:05.424
- What?
- Exactly what I said.

36:05.511 --> 36:08.949
- I'll double your bounty.
- I don't do that.

36:09.036 --> 36:10.777
Fine, I'll triple it.

36:10.864 --> 36:12.779
Why?

36:12.866 --> 36:15.782
Look, it doesn't matter.
Will you do it?

36:15.869 --> 36:20.003
You killed Chief Green
and the druggie, didn't you?

36:20.090 --> 36:21.962
You're worried O'Brien
can identify you.

36:22.049 --> 36:25.226
Just...just name your price.

36:25.313 --> 36:26.575
A million bucks.

36:26.662 --> 36:28.142
- Come on. That's not even..
- Whoa!

36:28.229 --> 36:30.013
Might need your daddy's
checkbook for that.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.798
Why? What's going on?

36:31.885 --> 36:34.279
O'Brien didn't witness anything.
He was nowhere near the cabin.

36:34.366 --> 36:36.933
But you were, weren't you?

36:37.020 --> 36:39.806
No. I..
Why would you say that?

36:39.893 --> 36:42.635
Well, you gave us that
videotape so easily.

36:42.722 --> 36:45.115
Practically handed us
Zubov as a suspect

36:45.203 --> 36:47.248
'and then there's the drugs.'

36:47.335 --> 36:50.947
A little partial to the cocaine,
aren't you, Chad?

36:53.298 --> 36:55.691
- No, I'm not.
- Okay, a lot partial.

36:55.778 --> 36:59.129
Dilated pupils, hyper-alert.
You're burning up.

36:59.217 --> 37:02.263
That's why you have this, uh,
personal air conditioner

37:02.350 --> 37:04.047
in an already-cool room.

37:04.134 --> 37:05.788
'And when I shook your hand'

37:05.875 --> 37:08.051
your pulse was thumping
like a jackhammer, my friend.

37:08.138 --> 37:09.923
Okay. Stay there!

37:10.010 --> 37:11.794
Chad, let him go.

37:11.881 --> 37:13.056
Stay there!

37:19.585 --> 37:22.849
Don't be stupid, Chad.
Let him go.

37:22.936 --> 37:25.460
Stay back, I'll shoot him!
I swear I'll shoot him!

37:25.547 --> 37:26.722
[alarm bell ringing]

37:26.809 --> 37:29.203
[both grunting]

37:41.084 --> 37:43.348
Nicely done, Lisbon family.

37:45.828 --> 37:48.701
[bell continues ringing]

37:55.185 --> 37:57.144
Our attorney
will be here soon.

37:57.231 --> 37:58.145
- What's the point?
- Son--

37:58.232 --> 38:00.930
I just wanna
be done with it.

38:01.017 --> 38:03.019
When did you start
dealing drugs?

38:03.106 --> 38:05.021
A year ago.

38:07.197 --> 38:10.026
Look, he doesn't
pay me anything.

38:10.113 --> 38:11.767
Dealing does.

38:11.854 --> 38:14.683
You were dealing to Steve Kasser
the night of the murders?

38:16.076 --> 38:17.556
What happened next?

38:17.643 --> 38:21.124
[Chad]
'That's when the cop came by.'

38:21.211 --> 38:23.518
She told us to take it easy.

38:23.605 --> 38:26.042
Then she started to talk
to Steve about his mother.

38:26.129 --> 38:29.524
'All I could think about was how
my father was gonna disown me'

38:29.611 --> 38:33.572
'how I'm gonna lose everything.'

38:33.659 --> 38:35.530
'I was so high.'

38:39.969 --> 38:42.972
I put Chief Green
in her trunk.

38:43.059 --> 38:45.279
'I tried to get Steven too'

38:45.366 --> 38:48.282
but he was too heavy,
so I left him there.

38:48.369 --> 38:50.066
Look, I didn't wanna
kill Steve, okay?

38:50.153 --> 38:52.808
I didn't wanna kill anybody,
but I had to.

38:52.895 --> 38:54.810
That has to count
for something, right?

38:56.377 --> 38:57.509
No.

39:04.080 --> 39:05.647
[knocking]

39:05.734 --> 39:07.432
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:07.519 --> 39:09.390
The kid wanted to say good-bye.

39:10.826 --> 39:12.132
[chuckling]

39:14.961 --> 39:16.919
Give me a minute
with your aunt, huh?

39:17.006 --> 39:18.791
- Yeah.
- Love you.

39:18.878 --> 39:20.575
Love you too.

39:25.363 --> 39:28.278
Listen, do you still
want O'Brien?

39:30.803 --> 39:32.848
Well...yeah, sure.

39:32.935 --> 39:34.546
He's downstairs in holding.

39:34.633 --> 39:36.330
I'll have them
release him to you.

39:36.417 --> 39:40.029
Wow. Thanks.

39:40.116 --> 39:42.989
This doesn't mean I think
what you're doing is right

39:43.076 --> 39:46.514
but I don't know.
Maybe I'm wrong.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.386
You got a great kid there

39:48.473 --> 39:50.518
so you're obviously
doing something right.

39:53.782 --> 39:56.306
I'm proud of you, Tommy.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.700
Maybe even a little envious.

40:03.531 --> 40:05.272
Thanks, Rees.

40:13.585 --> 40:16.544
I love you, Tommy.

40:16.631 --> 40:22.289
And, um, you know that
I'm always here for you, right?

40:22.376 --> 40:25.727
Yeah, I know that.

40:25.814 --> 40:27.207
Okay.

40:35.084 --> 40:36.738
[exhaling deeply]

40:36.825 --> 40:38.697
[whispering]
Be careful, Tommy.

40:47.793 --> 40:50.012
[theme music]
