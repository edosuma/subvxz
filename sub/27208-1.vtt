- Yeah! Yeah?

03:02.640 --> 03:04.871
Are you finished packing for school?

03:05.080 --> 03:06.196
Yeah.

- Personal chauffeur going once.
- It's okay.

Hey, I'm just walking by. How you doin'?

Yo, Miles!
You feel that earthquake last night?

03:51.840 --> 03:54.560

I slept like a baby last night.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.518

- So easy.

Walking would've been fine.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.536
You can walk plenty on Saturday
when you peel those stickers off.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.472
You saw that? I don't know if that was me.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.871
And the two from yesterday on Clinton.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.872
Yeah, those were me.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.360
Oh. Look at that.
Another new coffee shop.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.193
- You see that?
- Totally. Yeah.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.113
- What's that one called?
- Foam Party.

04:34.280 --> 04:37.193
"Foam Party"? Ha, ha. Come on.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.317

- ...lives on the line, no masks.
- Uh-huh.

- We show our faces.
- Speed up. I know these kids.

05:03.440 --> 05:05.352

great accountability.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.000

You've given it two weeks.
We're not having this conversation.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.115
- I just think that this new school is elitist.
- "Elitist"?

05:33.280 --> 05:36.273
And I would prefer to be
at a normal school among the people.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.199
"The people"? These are your people.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.756
I'm only here

05:40.920 --> 05:43.435
No way. You passed the entry test

05:43.600 --> 05:46.240

You wanna blow that?

06:10.160 --> 06:12.959

- I wanna hear it. "I love you, Dad."
- You wanna hear me say it?

06:22.480 --> 06:24.296
- You're dropping me off at a school.
- "I love you, Dad."

06:24.320 --> 06:25.960
- Look at this place.
- "Dad, I love you."

06:28.120 --> 06:30.680
Dad, I love you.

06:30.840 --> 06:31.990

06:42.680 --> 06:45.115

- "That's a copy."

06:45.280 --> 06:49.194
Oh, my gosh! This is embarrassing.
We wore the same jacket.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.317
Hey. Your shoe's untied.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.995
Yeah, I'm aware. It's a choice.

07:00.240 --> 07:01.469

07:42.120 --> 07:44.589
Sorry. It was just so quiet.

07:45.200 --> 07:49.080

08:32.880 --> 08:34.599
- 50%?
- That's right!

08:34.760 --> 08:39.118

12:49.080 --> 12:53.074
Yeah. You know, me and your dad used
to do this back in the day.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.640
- Stop lyin'.
- It's true.

12:55.480 --> 12:58.757
Then he took on the cop thing,
and I don't know...

12:59.360 --> 13:01.829
He's a good guy, just...

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
You know what I'm sayin'.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.311
All right, come on, man. I gotta roll.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.558
Miles, let's go.

14:08.560 --> 14:09.755
<i>That's weird.</i>

14:09.920 --> 14:11.877
<i>My pants shrank.</i>

14:12.080 --> 14:13.434
I think I hit puberty.

14:21.480 --> 14:23.153
<i>I gotta get new pants.</i>

14:23.320 --> 14:26.040
<i>Wait. Why is the voice in my head
so loud?</i>

14:26.200 --> 14:27.236
What?

14:28.120 --> 14:31.113
- Oh! Are you okay?
- What?

14:31.280 --> 14:32.760
<i>Why am I so sweaty?</i>

14:32.920 --> 14:34.036
Why are you so sweaty?

14:34.720 --> 14:36.916
It's a puberty thing.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.640
I don't know why I said that.
I'm not going through puberty.

14:40.040 --> 14:43.272
I did, but I'm done.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.756
I'm a man.

14:45.920 --> 14:48.913
So you're, like,
new here, right? We got that in common.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.999
Yeah. That's one thing.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.475
Cool. Yeah.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.471
I'm Miles.

14:53.640 --> 14:56.599
I'm Gwe... anda.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.319
Wait, your name is Gwanda?

14:58.480 --> 15:01.678
Yes, it's African. I'm South African.

15:01.840 --> 15:05.038
Uh, no accent though
'cause I was raised here.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.796
<i>Do the shoulder touch now
before she walks away.</i>

15:11.360 --> 15:13.272
<i>Why is this so scary?</i>

15:14.200 --> 15:17.830
<i>Am I doing this in slow motion
or does it just feel that way?</i>

15:18.280 --> 15:22.399
I'm kidding.
It's Wanda. No "G." That's crazy. Heh.

15:24.360 --> 15:25.360
Hey.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.436
Okay, then. Uh...

15:28.600 --> 15:29.636
I'll see you around.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.834
Oh. See you.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.037
- Sorry. Um...
- Hey.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.637
- Oh, crap.
- Um, can you let go, please?

15:38.800 --> 15:41.634
- I can't let go.
- Ow, ow, ow. Calm down. It's fine.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.833
- Miles, let go.
- Workin' on it.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.480
It's just puberty.

15:47.640 --> 15:51.316
I don't think you know what puberty is.
Just relax.

15:51.480 --> 15:52.914
- Okay, I have a plan.
- Great.

15:53.080 --> 15:56.152
- I'm gonna pull really hard.
- That's a terrible plan.

15:56.320 --> 15:57.320
- One.
- Don't do this.

15:57.480 --> 15:58.480
- Two.
- Three!

16:05.680 --> 16:06.750
Nice to meet you?

16:06.920 --> 16:09.833
Sure. Total pleasure.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.434
<i>No one saw. It's okay.</i>

16:18.880 --> 16:21.759
<i>No one knows, no one knows.</i>

16:23.920 --> 16:25.274
<i>Everyone knows.</i>

16:27.080 --> 16:29.834
<i>Everyone knows. They're talkin'
'bout me. They saw everything!</i>

16:30.000 --> 16:31.832
<i>He knows. She knows. They know.</i>

16:32.000 --> 16:33.320
<i>Wow, she's super tall.</i>

16:33.480 --> 16:36.200
<i>Why is he smiling? Am I
the weird guy now? What am I doing?</i>

16:36.360 --> 16:37.635
That guy's such a weirdo.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.359
<i>How do I stop?</i>

16:39.560 --> 16:43.873
<i>Can they hear my thoughts?!
Why are all my thoughts so loud?!</i>

16:44.040 --> 16:46.714
Hey! I know you snuck out last night,
Morales.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.155
<i>Play dumb!</i>

16:48.360 --> 16:49.589
Who's Morales?

16:49.760 --> 16:51.399
<i>Not that dumb!</i>

16:51.840 --> 16:52.876
Hey!

16:59.960 --> 17:02.429
<i>Okay, okay. You're okay. You're okay.</i>

17:03.280 --> 17:04.509
<i>He'll never find you.</i>

17:05.200 --> 17:06.395
<i>No.</i>

17:11.520 --> 17:12.520
Ow!

17:13.400 --> 17:15.675
What are you doing in my office,
Morales?!

17:15.839 --> 17:17.911
Morales! Open up!

17:18.480 --> 17:20.215
<i>♪ Spider bells, goblin smells ♪</i>

17:20.240 --> 17:22.391
Why is this happening?

17:22.599 --> 17:24.159
<i>♪ Spider buggy blew a tire ♪♪</i>

17:24.520 --> 17:26.079
He's got a nice voice.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.439
Open up!

17:30.760 --> 17:32.319
Stop sticking!

17:35.520 --> 17:37.989
Keep sticking, Miles! Whoa!

17:47.560 --> 17:50.029
...Hofstadter is suggesting...

17:50.440 --> 17:52.830
...is that we...

17:53.000 --> 17:54.036
...look on the...

18:00.200 --> 18:01.395
Okay.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.199
My room!

18:12.400 --> 18:13.629
<i>"Why is this happening?"</i>

18:15.560 --> 18:16.710
<i>"Please stop sticking."</i>

18:19.000 --> 18:20.275
<i>"Please keep st..."</i>

18:20.440 --> 18:21.556
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

18:21.720 --> 18:25.316
How could there be two Spider-Men?
There can't be two Spider-Men.

18:26.920 --> 18:27.920
<i>Can there?</i>

18:30.520 --> 18:33.115
<i>Come on, Uncle Aaron, pick up. Pick up!</i>

18:33.280 --> 18:35.616
<i>Yo, it's Aaron.
I'm outta town for a few days.</i>

18:35.640 --> 18:37.313
<i>I'll hit you when I'm back. Peace.</i>

18:37.480 --> 18:39.039
<i>No. No-No-No-No-No.</i>

18:39.200 --> 18:41.317
<i>It's not possible!</i>

18:41.840 --> 18:43.194
<i>It's just puberty.</i>

18:43.360 --> 18:46.034
<i>It's a normal spider and I'm a normal kid!</i>

18:46.280 --> 18:47.873
Whoa!

18:49.000 --> 18:50.832
All right!

18:54.880 --> 18:56.917
<i>I gotta tell someone.</i>

19:20.480 --> 19:23.518
Okay, you're being crazy, Miles.
You're being crazy.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.833
Find the spider.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.593
You'll see.

19:45.240 --> 19:46.594
It's a normal spider.

19:46.760 --> 19:52.313
It's, like, boring how normal this spider is.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.519
<i>I'm right here.</i>

20:02.720 --> 20:05.110
<i>Why is this happening to me?</i>

20:11.120 --> 20:12.998
<i>Slow down! What am I doing?</i>

20:19.640 --> 20:20.676
<i>Way over there.</i>

20:20.840 --> 20:21.876
<i>You're like me.</i>

20:22.040 --> 20:23.679
<i>Miles. Look out.</i>

20:23.840 --> 20:26.435
<i>- I don't wanna be a hero.
- Miles.</i>

20:28.520 --> 20:29.670
Whoa!

20:33.040 --> 20:35.555
Norman, listen to me.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.275
<i>Spider-Man?</i>

20:37.440 --> 20:40.194
I cannot let you open a portal
to another dimension.

20:40.360 --> 20:43.080
Brooklyn is not zoned for that.

20:43.960 --> 20:45.474
It's not up to me.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.160
<i>Is that Green Goblin?!</i>

20:47.320 --> 20:48.390
Why won't you quit?!

20:48.600 --> 20:51.354
I guess I like Brooklyn not being sucked
into a black hole.

20:51.560 --> 20:52.596
I think I'm gonna go.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.231
Staten Island, maybe. Not Brooklyn.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.439
No! No!

21:24.240 --> 21:25.469
Whoa!

21:27.440 --> 21:29.113
What now?

21:29.280 --> 21:30.760
What is this place?

21:57.480 --> 21:59.915
Did you know your shoes are untied?

22:00.600 --> 22:01.600
Uh-huh.

22:01.760 --> 22:04.594
This is a onesie,
so I don't really have to worry about it.

22:10.560 --> 22:13.553
I thought I was the only one.
You're like me.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.116
I don't wanna be.

22:15.280 --> 22:17.954
I don't think you have a choice, kiddo.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.836
Got a lot going through your head,
I'm sure.

22:21.000 --> 22:21.831
Yeah.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.071
You're gonna be fine. I can help you.

22:24.280 --> 22:26.237
If you stick around,
I can show you the ropes.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.075
Yeah.

22:29.320 --> 22:32.313
I just need to destroy
this big machine real quick...

22:32.480 --> 22:34.216
...before the space-time continuum
collapses.

22:34.240 --> 22:35.276
Don't move.

22:38.560 --> 22:40.279
See you in a bit.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.395
<i>How does he do that?</i>

22:54.920 --> 22:57.958
Is it here? No, no, it's here.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.278
All right, folks.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.550
I always get this wrong.

23:02.640 --> 23:03.676
Oh, boy.

23:05.080 --> 23:06.080
Prowler.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.872
Man, I was in the middle of something.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.116
I am so tired.

23:19.560 --> 23:21.836
Are you mad at me?
I feel like you're mad at me.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.719
That all you got?

23:33.160 --> 23:34.276
Aw, so gross.

23:35.360 --> 23:37.716
<i>I should go up there and help him.</i>

23:38.240 --> 23:40.914
<i>Who am I kidding?
I should not do that.</i>

23:46.240 --> 23:49.551
Watch out. Here comes the Spider-Man.

23:50.240 --> 23:51.435
You like my new toy?

23:52.240 --> 23:56.314
Cost me a fortune,
but, hey, can't take it with you, right?

23:57.320 --> 23:59.630
You came all this way. Watch the test.

24:00.120 --> 24:02.520
It's a hell of a freaking light show.
You're gonna love this.

24:05.880 --> 24:08.554
No! No, don't do this! Stop!

24:09.200 --> 24:12.511
You don't know what it can do!
You'll kill us all!

24:27.240 --> 24:29.994
I see multiple dimensions opening!

24:30.160 --> 24:34.951
That was three, four
and five separate dimensions.

24:35.160 --> 24:37.038
It's unstable! We should stop.

24:49.800 --> 24:52.031
Norm, what's your take on head trauma?

24:55.880 --> 24:57.837
I tried to warn you, pal.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.635
Goblin, no! Get him outta there!

25:19.600 --> 25:21.751
<i>Wilson! Where are we?</i>

25:23.840 --> 25:25.399
<i>Really weird.</i>

25:25.560 --> 25:26.960
<i>Wilson!</i>

26:00.480 --> 26:02.551
Hey! Are you okay?

26:02.720 --> 26:04.996
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm just resting.

26:06.720 --> 26:09.235
- Can't you get up?
- Yeah. Ha, ha.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.595
Yeah, I always get up.

26:12.840 --> 26:14.513
The coughing's probably not a good sign.

26:14.680 --> 26:16.558
Find him. Now.

26:16.760 --> 26:19.434
Listen, we gotta team up here.
We don't have that much time.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.794
This override key is the only way
to stop the collider.

26:22.960 --> 26:26.397
Swing up there, use this key,
push the button and blow it up.

26:26.600 --> 26:27.829
You need to hide your face.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.117
You don't tell anyone who you are.

26:30.280 --> 26:33.478
No one can know.
He's got everyone in his pocket.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.951
If he turns the machine on again,
everything you know will disappear.

26:37.120 --> 26:38.873
Your family, everyone.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.679
Everyone.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.711
Promise me you'll do this.

26:48.280 --> 26:49.430
I promise.

26:50.080 --> 26:52.436
Go. Destroy the collider.

26:52.600 --> 26:54.000
I'll come and find you.

26:55.880 --> 26:56.996
It's gonna be okay.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.991
Tombstone. We're done with tests.

27:09.800 --> 27:12.872
Get that thing ready to go again.
And soon.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.838
Run faster!

27:15.000 --> 27:16.036
These guys are weak.

27:16.680 --> 27:20.230
I'd say it's nice to see you again,
Spider-Man, but it's not.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.278
Hey, Kingpin. How's business?

27:22.440 --> 27:23.715
Boomin'. Ha!

27:23.880 --> 27:26.076
Nice. Aw, that's a no-no.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.631
This might open
a black hole under Brooklyn.

27:30.520 --> 27:32.239
It can't be worth the risk.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.120
It's not always about the money,
Spider-Man.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.837
Don't you wanna know
what I saw in there?

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
Wait.

27:45.480 --> 27:47.995
I know what you're trying to do...

27:48.360 --> 27:49.953
...and it won't work.

27:50.120 --> 27:51.156
They're gone.

28:05.320 --> 28:06.515
Get rid of the body.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.278
What was that?

28:12.280 --> 28:13.316
Kill that guy.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.957
Stop sticking!

29:08.720 --> 29:11.872
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors, please.</i>

29:37.080 --> 29:38.912
Yeah, I think it's a Banksy.

29:48.440 --> 29:49.999
Police! Put your hands up!

29:50.160 --> 29:51.753
Miles? Miles?

29:53.320 --> 29:57.758
Why aren't you at school?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's okay. It's okay.

29:57.920 --> 30:00.037
Miles? <i>¿Qué te pasa?</i>

30:02.880 --> 30:04.280
Is it the earthquake?

30:06.040 --> 30:07.554
Can I sleep here tonight?

30:07.720 --> 30:11.031
Miles. It's a weeknight.
You made a commitment to that school.

30:11.240 --> 30:12.640
He's upset.

30:15.240 --> 30:17.311
Of course you can stay.

30:18.680 --> 30:19.875
- Dad?
- Yeah.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.994
Do you really hate Spider-Man?

30:26.200 --> 30:28.795
Yeah. I mean, with a vigilante, there is...

30:28.960 --> 30:29.996
Jeff, <i>mi amor.</i>

30:30.160 --> 30:34.677
What? He asked me. Baby, you know
how I feel about Spider-Man. Come on.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.800
<i>Tú sabes que él te quiere mucho.</i>

30:38.960 --> 30:41.714
That's why he's tough on you.
You know that, right?

30:42.240 --> 30:46.200
Mom, do you ever think
about moving out of Brooklyn?

30:46.400 --> 30:49.598
Our family doesn't run from things, Miles.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.276
Yeah, I know.

30:55.440 --> 30:58.160
- What's that about?
- He's having a hard time, Jeff.

30:58.320 --> 31:00.920
When it gets hard,
that's when he's gotta stick it out.

31:07.880 --> 31:11.032
<i>We interrupt
this broadcast for a special report.</i>

31:12.520 --> 31:15.194
<i>Sad news tonight.
The hero known as Spider-Man...</i>

31:15.360 --> 31:19.718
<i>...has died after injuries related to another
powerful earthquake in Brooklyn.</i>

31:19.880 --> 31:22.793
<i>Multiple sources are confirming

<i>...a 26-year-old grad student
and part-time photographer...</i>

31:26.000 --> 31:29.755

31:30.560 --> 31:32.950

31:36.520 --> 31:39.479
<i>♪ I'm not scared ♪♪</i>

31:39.720 --> 31:44.192
<i>He is survived by his wife,
Mary Jane, and his aunt, May Parker.</i>

31:45.480 --> 31:48.075
<i>Our hero, Spider-Man, is gone.</i>

31:49.600 --> 31:52.160
<i>My husband, Peter Parker...</i>

31:52.320 --> 31:54.915
<i>...was an ordinary person.</i>

31:55.080 --> 31:58.391
<i>He always said it could've been
anyone behind the mask.</i>

31:58.600 --> 32:01.957
<i>He was just the kid
who happened to get bit.</i>

32:02.480 --> 32:04.676
I'm going to miss him.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.031
Yeah.

32:06.200 --> 32:08.112
We were friends, you know.

32:08.320 --> 32:09.834
Can I return it if it doesn't fit?

32:10.000 --> 32:11.150
It always fits...

32:12.600 --> 32:14.398
...eventually.

32:20.640 --> 32:22.472
<i>He didn't ask for his powers...</i>

32:25.680 --> 32:28.275
<i>...but he chose to be Spider-Man.</i>

32:29.160 --> 32:31.755
<i>My favorite thing about Peter...</i>

32:31.920 --> 32:35.436
<i>...is that he made us each feel powerful.</i>

32:36.040 --> 32:39.431
<i>We all have powers
of one kind or another.</i>

32:42.320 --> 32:44.039
But in our own way...

32:44.200 --> 32:45.998
...we are all Spider-Man.

32:46.680 --> 32:49.070
<i>And we're all counting on you.</i>

32:49.920 --> 32:51.593
They're counting on me.

32:51.760 --> 32:55.879
Probably not you specifically.
I think it's a metaphor.

34:46.520 --> 34:48.751
I'm sorry, Mr. Parker.

34:49.120 --> 34:52.192
That thing you gave me, that key...

34:52.840 --> 34:55.878
...I think I really messed it up.

34:57.520 --> 34:59.432
I wanna do what you asked.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.193
I really do.

35:01.360 --> 35:04.239
But I'm sorry.

35:04.760 --> 35:07.070
I'm not sure I'm the guy.

35:07.760 --> 35:10.753
I can't do this without you.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.478
Hey, kid. Ahh!

35:14.840 --> 35:15.840
Whoa!

35:18.720 --> 35:20.040
What did I do to him?!

35:31.720 --> 35:32.720
No.

35:37.160 --> 35:39.277
Who <i>are</i> you?

35:40.680 --> 35:44.037
<i>All right, people,
let's do this one last time.</i>

35:45.680 --> 35:48.195
<i>My name is Peter B. Parker.</i>

35:49.160 --> 35:51.117
<i>I was bitten by a radioactive spider.</i>

35:51.280 --> 35:53.476
<i>And for the last 22 years...</i>

35:53.640 --> 35:57.680
<i>...I thought I was
the one and only Spider-Man.</i>

35:58.880 --> 36:00.200
What a day.

36:00.640 --> 36:02.677
<i>I'm pretty sure you know the rest.</i>

36:02.840 --> 36:05.514
<i>You see, I saved the city,
fell in love, I got married...</i>

36:05.720 --> 36:07.757
<i>...saved the city some more,
maybe too much.</i>

36:07.920 --> 36:10.116
<i>My marriage got testy,
made some dicey money choices.</i>

36:10.280 --> 36:12.840
<i>Don't invest
in a spider-themed restaurant.</i>

36:13.000 --> 36:15.754
<i>Then like 15 years passed.
Blah, blah, blah. Super boring.</i>

36:15.920 --> 36:18.992
<i>I broke my back, a drone flew
into my face, I buried Aunt May.</i>

36:19.160 --> 36:21.516
<i>My wife and I... split up.</i>

36:21.680 --> 36:23.751
<i>But I handled it like a champion.</i>

36:25.160 --> 36:29.313
<i>'Cause, you know what, no matter how
many times I get hit, I always get back up.</i>

36:34.000 --> 36:37.516
<i>And I got a lot of time to reflect
and work on myself.</i>

36:37.680 --> 36:40.639
<i>Did you know that seahorses,
that they mate for life?</i>

36:41.360 --> 36:42.476
<i>Could you imagine?</i>

36:42.640 --> 36:45.872
<i>A seahorse seeing another seahorse...</i>

36:46.040 --> 36:47.713
<i>...and then making it work?</i>

36:49.160 --> 36:51.675
<i>She wanted kids and...</i>

36:51.840 --> 36:53.194
<i>And it scared me.</i>

36:55.040 --> 36:57.475
<i>I'm pretty sure I broke her heart.</i>

36:57.640 --> 36:59.871
<i>I'm in my apartment doing push-ups...</i>

37:00.040 --> 37:01.918
<i>...doing ab crunches, getting strong...</i>

37:02.080 --> 37:04.072
<i>...when this weird thing happened.</i>

37:04.600 --> 37:07.559
<i>And I gotta say,
weird things happen to me a lot.</i>

37:07.720 --> 37:10.599
<i>But this was real weird.</i>

37:53.280 --> 37:54.430
Ow!

37:55.960 --> 37:59.078
<i>You see, I was in New York,
but things were different.</i>

37:59.240 --> 38:01.675
<i>Also, I was dead.</i>

38:01.880 --> 38:03.280
<i>And blond.</i>

38:03.440 --> 38:05.557
<i>I was kind of perfect.</i>

38:05.760 --> 38:08.958
<i>It was like looking in a mirror.</i>

38:09.760 --> 38:14.835
<i>I have a feeling that the thing that brought
me here was the thing that got him killed.</i>

38:16.240 --> 38:18.550
<i>You wanna know what happened next?</i>

38:22.080 --> 38:23.230
<i>Me, too.</i>

38:23.440 --> 38:24.840
Who <i>are</i> you?

38:25.000 --> 38:26.753
What are you doin' over there?

38:26.920 --> 38:28.877
Freeze! PDNY.

38:29.320 --> 38:30.320
Stop!

38:33.560 --> 38:36.075
Are you kidding me right now?

38:36.440 --> 38:37.840
Stop! Stop!

38:38.040 --> 38:39.474
I gotcha. I gotcha.

38:39.640 --> 38:40.960
Hey, kid. Drop the body.

38:43.840 --> 38:46.674
- Hey, kid. Get over here!
- Come on, now!

38:48.600 --> 38:50.796
See you, officers! Heh, heh.

38:51.720 --> 38:52.949
Aw, come on.

38:58.800 --> 39:00.757
- Hey, kid.
- Kid, come on, now!

39:00.920 --> 39:02.877
Put 'em up, son!

39:06.960 --> 39:08.076
Uh...<i>adiós?</i>

39:12.240 --> 39:14.835
Help! Somebody stop that train!

39:32.480 --> 39:34.517
Oh, hey. What the...?

39:37.600 --> 39:38.600
Sorry.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.876
I'm gonna die!

39:49.280 --> 39:51.616
<i>Looks like
a child dressed like Spider-Man...</i>

39:51.640 --> 39:54.678
<i>...dragging a homeless corpse
behind a train.</i>

39:55.760 --> 39:57.399
Whoo! Yes! I didn't kill you.

39:57.560 --> 39:58.914
- Who are you?
- Who are <i>you?</i>

39:59.120 --> 40:02.113
- Why are you trying to kill me?
- I'm not. I'm trying to save you.

40:21.800 --> 40:24.838
Hey, maybe you guys can go around?

40:25.200 --> 40:27.635
All right. Thanks, New York.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.354
<i>What was that?</i>

40:40.080 --> 40:42.072
<i>Kid electrocuted me...</i>

40:42.240 --> 40:43.833
<i>...with his hands.</i>

40:47.240 --> 40:49.596
- You're like me.
- I got some questions.

40:54.440 --> 40:56.033
Why do you look like Peter Parker?

40:58.800 --> 41:00.075
Because I am Peter Parker.

41:00.240 --> 41:02.709
Then why aren't you dead?
And why is your hair different?

41:02.880 --> 41:05.315
Why are you older?
And why is your body...

41:05.520 --> 41:06.920
...a different shape?

41:07.080 --> 41:08.673
Pretty sure you just called me fat.

41:08.840 --> 41:10.479
You don't look so hot either, kid.

41:10.640 --> 41:12.472
Most superheroes don't wear
their own merch.

41:12.640 --> 41:13.960
- Are you a ghost?
- No.

41:14.120 --> 41:15.315
- Are you a zombie?
- Stop it.

41:15.480 --> 41:16.936
- Am I a zombie?
- You're not even close.

41:16.960 --> 41:18.176
Are you from another dimension?

41:18.200 --> 41:20.936
Like a parallel universe where things
are like this universe but different?

41:20.960 --> 41:23.077
And you're Spider-Man in that universe?

41:23.240 --> 41:25.960
But somehow traveled to this universe,
but you don't know how?

41:26.120 --> 41:29.511
- Wow. That was really just a guess?
- We learned about it in physics.

41:29.680 --> 41:31.433
- Quantum theory.
- This is amazing!

41:31.600 --> 41:33.637
You can teach me
like Peter said he would.

41:33.840 --> 41:34.637
Before he died.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.040
- Yeah. Exactly.
- Yeah, right.

41:36.440 --> 41:37.840
Look, I made a promise to him.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.434
Here's lesson number one, kid.

41:39.640 --> 41:41.916
Don't watch the mouth.
Watch the hands.

41:47.600 --> 41:49.432
Peter, seriously...

41:52.280 --> 41:55.352
Trust me, kid.
This'll all make you a better Spider-Man.

42:00.720 --> 42:02.313
Hey, are you okay?

42:02.480 --> 42:03.516
No, I'm not.

42:03.680 --> 42:05.034
What's going on with your body?

42:05.200 --> 42:08.557
I don't think my atoms are real jazzed
about being in the wrong dimension.

42:11.080 --> 42:14.312
Look, I'm not looking for a side gig
as a Spider-Man coach.

42:14.480 --> 42:16.437
I got a lot going on in my dimension.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.557
"With great power comes great..."

42:18.760 --> 42:22.640
Don't you dare finish that sentence.
Don't do it! I'm sick of it.

42:26.040 --> 42:28.760
Want my advice?
Go back to being a regular kid.

42:28.920 --> 42:32.596
I don't have a choice! Kingpin's got
a supercollider. He's tryin' to kill me.

42:32.760 --> 42:35.036
- What did you just say?
- Kingpin's tryin' to kill me.

42:35.200 --> 42:37.192
Who cares about that.
Where's the collider?

42:37.360 --> 42:38.714
Brooklyn. Under Fisk Tower.

42:38.880 --> 42:40.075
- Goodbye.
- Where you going?

42:40.280 --> 42:42.296
When it runs again,
I'll jump in and get back to my life.

42:42.320 --> 42:43.360
You can't let them run it.

42:43.520 --> 42:46.718
I'm supposed to destroy it so it never
runs again or everyone's gonna die.

42:46.880 --> 42:50.351
"Or everyone's gonna die."
That is what they always say.

42:50.520 --> 42:53.194
But there's always a little bit of time
before everybody dies...

42:53.360 --> 42:54.953
...and that's when I do my best work.

42:55.120 --> 42:56.554
Aren't you gonna need this?

42:56.760 --> 42:58.319
Aw, you have a goober. Give it.

42:58.480 --> 43:01.678
Wait, no. Not so fast.
He called it an override key.

43:01.840 --> 43:04.196
There's always a bypass key,
a virus key, a who-cares key.

43:04.360 --> 43:06.720
I can never remember,
so I always call it a goober. Give it.

43:06.880 --> 43:10.191
- I need it to destroy the collider.
- I need it to go home.

43:10.360 --> 43:11.800
I'll swallow it. Don't play with me.

43:11.880 --> 43:13.872
- What?
- I said...

43:14.040 --> 43:17.431
The collider created a portal
that brought me here. And I have to get...

43:18.080 --> 43:21.437
- Did you break this?
- No, it broke.

43:22.360 --> 43:23.680
I don't remember what happened.

43:23.840 --> 43:25.797
See, this is why I never had kids.

43:25.960 --> 43:28.191
- Can't we make another one?
<i>- We</i> can't do anything.

43:28.360 --> 43:31.751
Thanks to you, I have to re-steal
what your guy stole from Alchemax...

43:31.960 --> 43:34.156
...and make another one of these.

43:34.760 --> 43:36.760
If I don't turn off the collider
after you leave...

43:36.840 --> 43:41.119
...everyone in this city, my parents,
my uncle and millions of others, will die.

43:41.280 --> 43:44.512
And you're just gonna go home and
leave me here to figure this out for myself?

43:45.360 --> 43:48.273
- You good with that, Spider-Man?
- Yeah.

43:58.000 --> 43:59.320
What are you doing?

43:59.840 --> 44:03.550
Making you feel guilty. Is it working?

44:03.720 --> 44:06.918
How could it...? No. Look at me.
Does it look like it's working?

44:07.760 --> 44:09.911
No. No, it's not...

44:12.440 --> 44:18.072
Ahh! No! No! No! Do not let him win!

44:19.080 --> 44:20.355
All right, kid. You win.

44:20.520 --> 44:22.716
Come on, we don't have a second to lose.

44:23.480 --> 44:25.517
I love this burger. So delicious.

44:25.720 --> 44:27.360
Mm. One of the best burgers
I've ever had.

44:27.400 --> 44:30.313
In my universe,
this place closed six years ago.

44:30.520 --> 44:33.035
I don't know why. I really don't. Mm!

44:35.640 --> 44:37.836
You have money, right?
I'm not very liquid right now.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.593
- Can we focus?
- Mm-hm. Sure.

44:39.760 --> 44:42.514
- The other Peter...
- You gonna eat that?

44:43.520 --> 44:44.556
I'm listening.

44:44.720 --> 44:47.001
The other Peter said he was
gonna be showing me the ropes.

44:47.120 --> 44:48.120
Wow.

44:48.280 --> 44:50.556
You got any Spider-Man tips
you can tell me now?

44:50.720 --> 44:51.836
Yeah, I got plenty.

44:52.040 --> 44:53.474
Disinfect the mask.

44:53.640 --> 44:56.997
You're gonna wanna use baby powder
in the suit, heavy on the joints.

44:57.160 --> 44:59.197
You don't want any chafing, right?

44:59.360 --> 45:01.556
- Anything else?
- Nope, that was everything.

45:01.760 --> 45:03.877
- I think you're gonna be a bad teacher.
- Uh.

45:04.040 --> 45:05.440
Look up where Alchemax is.

45:06.040 --> 45:09.272
"A private technological campus
in Hudson Valley, New York."

45:10.120 --> 45:12.715
You can teach me
to swing on the way there. Fwsh, fwsh!

45:15.240 --> 45:19.553
I'm not swinging to the Hudson Valley,
Miles. Not after a hearty burger breakfast.

45:19.720 --> 45:21.791
Keep your legs fresh.
You're gonna thank me later.

45:23.960 --> 45:27.954
<i>♪ I can see a new horizon
Underneath the blazing sky ♪</i>

45:28.160 --> 45:30.834
<i>♪ I'll be where the eagle's flying higher ♪♪</i>

45:31.360 --> 45:33.556
- And it's a no on the cape.
- I think it's cool.

45:33.720 --> 45:36.997
Take that off. It's disrespectful.
Spider-Man doesn't wear a cape.

45:38.360 --> 45:42.070
- How do we retrace Peter's steps?
- That's a good question.

45:42.240 --> 45:45.119
What would I do if I were me?

45:46.240 --> 45:47.071
Got it.

45:47.240 --> 45:48.913
<i>Step One: I infiltrate the lab.</i>

45:49.080 --> 45:51.197
<i>Two: Find the head scientist's computer.</i>

45:51.360 --> 45:54.680
<i>That lady with the bike is the head
scientist. I saw her in this documentary.</i>

45:54.840 --> 45:57.116
<i>Cool! Step Three:
I reexamine my personal biases.</i>

45:57.280 --> 45:58.794
<i>Step Four: I hack the computer.</i>

45:58.960 --> 46:00.360
It's not technically hacking.

46:00.520 --> 46:02.398
Not now. I just lost my train of thought.

46:02.560 --> 46:05.678
<i>Step Five: Download the important stuff.
I'll know it when I see it.</i>

46:05.840 --> 46:08.912
<i>Step Six: I grab a bagel
from the cafeteria and run.</i>

46:09.120 --> 46:10.554
So, what am I doing?

46:10.720 --> 46:13.918
Step Seven: You stay here.
You're lookout. Very important.

46:14.120 --> 46:18.672
Look, man. You gotta teach me how to do
Spider-Man stuff or I won't be able to help.

46:19.320 --> 46:22.358
Watch and learn, kid! I'll quiz ya later!

46:25.000 --> 46:28.516
Why did I get stuck with the janky,
old, broke hobo Spider-Man?!

46:30.120 --> 46:31.236
That's new.

46:41.240 --> 46:42.240
Kingpin.

46:46.360 --> 46:49.398
<i>What am I doing? What am I doing?
What am I doing? What am I doing?</i>

47:06.440 --> 47:07.874
Peter!

47:08.040 --> 47:09.599
Peter!

47:10.280 --> 47:11.111
Ah! Peter!

47:11.280 --> 47:13.376
- What are you doing here?
- Kingpin's here.

47:13.400 --> 47:14.629
Just move over.

47:14.800 --> 47:17.554
You're steppin' on my foot.
Go back outside.

47:17.720 --> 47:21.031
No! I can't sit there and let Spider-Man
die without doing anything about it.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.271
I'm not doing that again.

47:24.040 --> 47:25.633
What?

47:25.800 --> 47:29.191
Most people I meet
in the workplace try to kill me...

47:29.760 --> 47:31.274
...so you're a nice change of pace.

47:32.680 --> 47:34.831
Mr. Fisk! Look at this data.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.880
I know you can't really understand it,
but these are really good numbers.

47:38.840 --> 47:40.797
And I got the password.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.356
Mr. Fisk. If we fire again this week...

47:43.520 --> 47:45.910
...there could be a black hole
under Brooklyn.

47:46.080 --> 47:47.560
You see this? And this?

47:47.760 --> 47:51.720
This is multiple dimensions beginning
to crash into each other.

47:51.880 --> 47:54.520
This is pretty standard
Spider-Man stakes. You get used to it.

47:54.720 --> 47:58.111
Watch this. He's gonna say,
"You've got 24 hours."

47:58.280 --> 47:59.396
You've got 24 hours.

47:59.600 --> 48:03.116
What this means is there could be
a rupture in the space-time continuum.

48:03.280 --> 48:06.751
Ooh. That's bad. Actually, everything
she said was bad. I was lying before.

48:15.640 --> 48:18.474
Hold on. Let me get you some more data.

48:20.240 --> 48:22.800
- What are you doing, bud?
- I can't move.

48:23.000 --> 48:27.472
Okay, relax your fingers. We don't
have time. Just let go. Be in the moment.

48:27.640 --> 48:29.518
I am in the moment.
It's a terrible moment.

48:29.680 --> 48:32.195
- I'm not refusing.
- No more excuses.

48:32.360 --> 48:33.794
I just need more time.

48:33.960 --> 48:35.640
They're right there.
They're gonna see you.

48:36.160 --> 48:37.799
Miles, you gotta unstick.

48:38.200 --> 48:39.714
What do you do to relax?

48:40.440 --> 48:43.035
Relax. Okay, okay, okay.

48:43.200 --> 48:45.590
♪ Needless to say I, uh, uh ♪

48:46.600 --> 48:48.034
Oh, for crying out loud.

48:48.440 --> 48:50.671
♪ Calling it quits
Now, baby, I'm a wreck ♪

48:53.640 --> 48:55.313
♪ Ooh ♪♪

48:55.480 --> 48:56.480
Ahh!

48:58.360 --> 49:00.080
Teenagers: just the worst.

49:02.800 --> 49:04.720
- Miles, where did you go?
- I'm right here.

49:04.840 --> 49:07.992
- Where? I can't see ya.
- I'm right in front of you.

49:08.160 --> 49:11.278
- Can Spider-Man turn invisible?
- Not in my universe.

49:11.440 --> 49:12.635
You just poked me in my eye!

49:12.840 --> 49:15.000
This is incredible.
Some kind of fight or flight thing.

49:15.160 --> 49:16.640
What's that?

49:18.960 --> 49:21.520
Remember this password.
D-g-f-a-m-p-e-s-a-n-d...

49:21.680 --> 49:22.511
Slow down!

49:22.680 --> 49:26.276
...-4-$-3-5-8-7-6-5-3-4-5-4-5-3-5.

49:26.480 --> 49:28.416
- I need to write it down!
- Download the schematic.

49:28.440 --> 49:30.557
- How do I do that?
- While I turn on the charm.

49:32.960 --> 49:33.996
Spider-Man?

49:34.160 --> 49:36.720
- Oh, hey. Didn't see you there.
- Wow!

49:37.840 --> 49:42.039
Okay, I'm kinda freaking out right now.
You're supposed to be dead.

49:42.200 --> 49:45.398
Surprise! Okay. That's a no-no.
We don't like that.

49:45.560 --> 49:46.676
This is fascinating.

49:47.280 --> 49:48.794
Okay, that's my face.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.117
An entirely different Peter Parker.

49:51.280 --> 49:53.795
Little bit of a gut,
perhaps from dimensional warping.

49:53.960 --> 49:56.555
Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah.
I was way flatter before I warped.

49:56.760 --> 49:59.514
Travel through the multiverse appears
to have deteriorated the...

50:00.600 --> 50:02.432
What was the rest?!

50:04.080 --> 50:07.994
Hey, how old are you?
'Cause you don't look a day over 35.

50:08.760 --> 50:10.896
They said
I was crazy! They said I was crazy!

50:10.920 --> 50:12.440
You showed 'em you're not crazy.

50:12.720 --> 50:14.279
This might pinch a little.

50:16.280 --> 50:18.795
- Ow! Ow!
- I know. I just need to get these samples.

50:18.960 --> 50:19.791
Okay.

50:19.960 --> 50:21.713
Organize your desktop, lady.

50:22.320 --> 50:25.358
Wow. Just complete cellular decay.

50:26.640 --> 50:29.456
- I've never seen anything like this.
- What are you doing?

50:29.480 --> 50:31.472
I'm just taking the whole thing.

50:31.640 --> 50:33.199
And obviously you've been glitching.

50:33.360 --> 50:36.353
"Glitchin""? No.
Why would you even say that?

50:36.520 --> 50:39.479
If you stay in this dimension too long,
your body's gonna disintegrate.

50:39.680 --> 50:41.876
Do you know how painful
that would be, Peter Parker?

50:42.040 --> 50:42.871
I don't know.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.997
You can't imagine.

50:45.160 --> 50:47.038
And I, for one...

50:47.200 --> 50:48.873
...can't wait to watch.

50:51.080 --> 50:52.320
What did you say your name was?

50:52.400 --> 50:54.517
Dr. Olivia Octavius.

51:02.040 --> 51:04.839
Can I assume
that your friends call you Doc Ock?

51:05.040 --> 51:07.157
My friends actually call me Liv.

51:07.320 --> 51:09.676
My enemies call me Doc Ock.

51:09.840 --> 51:11.160
I got this! Run!

51:11.320 --> 51:13.198
Who are you talking to?

51:15.520 --> 51:18.035
- I got it!
- Oh, you "got it," Peter?

51:20.240 --> 51:21.720
I got it handled, buddy!

51:23.640 --> 51:25.074
Everything is fine!

51:27.600 --> 51:31.150
- Okay, this is a little bit bad.
- You're chatty.

51:31.320 --> 51:32.360
Gotta go.

51:35.040 --> 51:37.635
This is the moment
that I'm losin' the fight.

51:39.760 --> 51:42.434
Let me tell you the good news.
We don't need the monitor.

51:42.600 --> 51:44.319
- Oh!
- Peter!

51:45.200 --> 51:48.830
You didn't tell me
you had an invisible friend!

51:49.040 --> 51:50.679
Could you give me that back,
young man?

51:50.840 --> 51:52.399
Peter!

51:52.560 --> 51:55.314
It's proprietary.

51:59.800 --> 52:00.870
Oh!

52:01.720 --> 52:04.235
- This'd be a good time to turn invisible.
- Yep.

52:04.400 --> 52:07.120
Okay, not gonna turn invisible.
Selecting a bagel.

52:07.680 --> 52:09.114
Act super normal.

52:09.280 --> 52:10.280
Spider-Man?

52:10.480 --> 52:13.154
- You know, that's funny, I get that a lot.
- Hey.

52:13.320 --> 52:15.471
- Spider-Man?
- Hey! Hands up!

52:15.640 --> 52:16.960
Now we do a switchy-switchy.

52:17.120 --> 52:19.271
Get back here!
Where do you think you're going?

52:19.440 --> 52:20.440
He took a bagel!

52:20.480 --> 52:23.678
- Time to swing, just like I taught ya.
- When did you teach me that?

52:23.840 --> 52:26.355
I didn't. It's a little joke for team-building.

52:26.520 --> 52:28.079
Hey!

52:28.240 --> 52:31.677
- All right, you ready?
- Of course I'm not ready! Oh! Oh, oh!

52:32.440 --> 52:33.476
I can't do this yet!

52:33.640 --> 52:35.632
Everybody knows
that the best way to learn...

52:35.800 --> 52:37.837
...is under intense
life-threatening pressure.

52:39.400 --> 52:40.400
Ow!

52:41.080 --> 52:42.958
Come on, come on, come on.

52:47.480 --> 52:48.480
Uh-oh.

52:53.720 --> 52:55.552
What are you doing down there?

52:55.720 --> 52:57.439
I run better than I swing.

52:57.600 --> 53:00.559
You gotta swing or they'll catch you.

53:00.720 --> 53:03.030
This is what you wanted.

53:08.520 --> 53:10.113
Uh-oh.

53:10.840 --> 53:11.990
Aha!

53:15.840 --> 53:17.320
Come back, little boy.

53:17.480 --> 53:19.790
Aim with your hips!
Look where you want it to hit.

53:19.960 --> 53:22.156
Square your shoulders.
Don't forget to follow through!

53:22.320 --> 53:23.640
Don't shoot off your back foot.

53:23.840 --> 53:26.355
- That's too many things!
- Then stop listening to me!

53:26.520 --> 53:29.718
That's the best idea you've had all day!

53:36.720 --> 53:39.110
Nice, Miles!

53:42.480 --> 53:44.119
- Ha, ha!
- Good. You're doin' it.

53:44.320 --> 53:46.880
Double tap to release
and thwip it out again.

53:47.040 --> 53:48.713
Thwip and release.

53:48.880 --> 53:52.032
- And thwip. Release. Thwip.
- And release.

53:52.200 --> 53:53.760
You're a natural. Thwip. Release.

53:53.880 --> 53:56.395
- Feel the rhythm?
- Whoo-hoo! Thwip. And release!

53:56.560 --> 53:59.758
- Good, Miles.
- I gotta say, you're amazing, man.

53:59.960 --> 54:01.314
We're a little team!

54:01.480 --> 54:03.153
Me as the teacher who could still do it.

54:03.320 --> 54:06.199
You as the student who can do it,
just not as good.

54:06.360 --> 54:09.159
I'm proud of us. Is there something
you want to say to me?

54:11.320 --> 54:12.356
Peter!

54:24.800 --> 54:26.359
- What the...?
- Who did that?

54:53.200 --> 54:54.236
Hey, guys.

54:54.400 --> 54:55.400
Gwanda?

54:55.600 --> 54:57.159
It's Gwen, actually.

54:57.320 --> 55:00.119
Oh, you know her. Very cool.

55:00.280 --> 55:02.078
I'm from another dimension.

55:02.240 --> 55:05.119
I mean, another-another dimension.

55:05.320 --> 55:08.000
<i>All right, people. Let's start
at the beginning one last time.</i>

55:08.120 --> 55:12.433
<i>My name is Gwen Stacy.
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.</i>

55:12.600 --> 55:17.595
<i>And for the last two years, I've been
the one and only Spider-Woman.</i>

55:17.760 --> 55:19.433
<i>You guys know the rest.</i>

55:19.600 --> 55:21.114
<i>I joined a band.</i>

55:22.720 --> 55:24.677
<i>Saved my dad.</i>

55:27.400 --> 55:30.154
<i>I couldn't save my best friend...</i>

55:30.320 --> 55:31.993
<i>...Peter Parker...</i>

55:33.520 --> 55:35.637
<i>...so now I save everyone else.</i>

55:35.800 --> 55:38.554
<i>And I don't do friends anymore...</i>

55:38.720 --> 55:40.598
<i>...just to avoid any distractions.</i>

55:41.720 --> 55:45.714
<i>And one day this weird thing happened.</i>

55:46.120 --> 55:49.318
<i>And I mean, like, really weird.</i>

55:54.720 --> 55:57.394
<i>I was blown into last week.</i>

56:00.960 --> 56:02.792
<i>Literally.</i>

56:03.000 --> 56:06.311
<i>I landed in New York,
but not my New York.</i>

56:07.960 --> 56:10.919
<i>Lucky for these
folks, Spider-Man saved the day.</i>

56:11.840 --> 56:14.878
<i>My Spider-sense told me
to head to Visions Academy.</i>

56:15.040 --> 56:16.156
...you guys are early.

56:17.040 --> 56:19.874
<i>Wasn't sure why until I met you.</i>

56:20.040 --> 56:21.360
Oh.

56:21.960 --> 56:23.110
I like your haircut.

56:23.280 --> 56:24.999
You don't get to like my haircut.

56:25.160 --> 56:25.991
Let's go.

56:26.160 --> 56:27.640
How many more Spider-People
are there?

56:27.800 --> 56:28.995
Save it for Comic-Con.

56:29.160 --> 56:30.389
What's Comic-Con?

56:30.560 --> 56:31.880
Whoa!

56:48.000 --> 56:49.434
You're dead, Spider-Man.

56:49.600 --> 56:51.831
Wilson! What are you doing?

56:52.000 --> 56:53.036
Vanessa.

56:53.200 --> 56:54.316
Richard, come on.

56:58.120 --> 56:59.793
Vanessa! Richard!

56:59.960 --> 57:01.189
<i>No!</i>

57:01.360 --> 57:04.000
Don't look back, honey.
It's okay. It's okay.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.719
I killed Spider-Man.

57:25.280 --> 57:26.794
Why did I just see two more?

57:27.320 --> 57:29.152
There's three, actually.

57:29.680 --> 57:31.876
No, this is good. This is very, very good.

57:32.040 --> 57:33.872
This means you get what you want.

57:34.040 --> 57:36.509
It means my collider works.

57:37.240 --> 57:40.392
All we have to do is kill
a couple of Spiders.

57:40.600 --> 57:42.751
And the collider will bring
your family back.

57:43.400 --> 57:45.835
As many families as you want.

57:54.880 --> 57:57.190
Tomorrow, at my collider.

57:57.840 --> 58:00.230
Our collider.

58:03.400 --> 58:04.470
He broke this?

58:04.640 --> 58:09.237
Yeah. He's actually really embarrassed
about it, so just keep it between us, okay?

58:10.880 --> 58:14.510
I know where we can make a new one.
And we won't let him break it this time.

58:17.520 --> 58:18.920
I'm sorry about your friend.

58:20.640 --> 58:21.676
Thanks, Miles.

58:24.160 --> 58:28.393
I know how hard this is. To have
to figure this stuff out on your own.

58:28.560 --> 58:31.553
It's kinda nice not being
the only Spider-person around.

58:32.120 --> 58:33.759
Yeah.

58:34.560 --> 58:38.634
If you ever decide to do friends again,
I could always open up a slot.

58:40.200 --> 58:42.715
I'll keep you posted.

58:43.360 --> 58:45.079
Cool.

58:49.680 --> 58:51.353
We should probably go.

58:51.520 --> 58:54.319
Peter, we're literally on the doorstep.

58:54.480 --> 58:57.075
- Bad idea. This is a bad idea.
- Just relax.

58:57.240 --> 59:01.598
You guys are all very sweet,
but no more fans today, please.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.354
I'm not ready for this.

59:11.440 --> 59:12.954
Peter?

59:14.720 --> 59:16.552
Hey, Aunt May.

59:16.720 --> 59:21.192
So this is gonna sound crazy,
but I'm pretty sure that I'm from an...

59:21.360 --> 59:22.760
An alternate dimension.

59:23.360 --> 59:24.396
Yeah.

59:25.840 --> 59:27.752
You look tired, Peter.

59:27.920 --> 59:30.037
Well, I am tired.

59:30.200 --> 59:33.238
- And older. And thicker.
- Yeah. I've heard that already.

59:33.400 --> 59:35.631
Oh, jeez. Are those sweatpants?

59:35.840 --> 59:37.957
Yup, that's what they are.

59:38.120 --> 59:39.793
I was there...

59:40.360 --> 59:42.272
...when it all happened.

59:42.440 --> 59:44.352
I am so sorry.

59:44.520 --> 59:46.432
And what dimension are you from?

59:46.640 --> 59:48.233
Brooklyn.

59:48.720 --> 59:51.838
Did Peter have a place where we could
make another one of these?

59:52.280 --> 59:53.714
A goober.

59:55.120 --> 59:56.156
Follow me.

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:03.676
Oh, yeah, I got one of these, too. A little,
old shed where I keep my Spider-gear.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.517
I mean, this place is pretentious.

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.353
Whoa.

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.559
Dude. Was yours anything like this?

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:36.997
Mine was like this,
but take away the jeep, the plane.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:40.756
Imagine it way smaller. Imagine a futon.

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:43.480
I feel sad for this guy.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.396
Hey, Peter.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.632
I think this is a cape.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.991
Peter knew how dangerous the job was.

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:25.839
But he figured the only one
who could stop this guy was Spider-Man.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:29.318
Kingpin knows we're coming.

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.278
We're going to be outnumbered.

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:33.511
Don't be so sure.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.637
You might need these.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.273
You think you're the only people
who thought to come here?

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.200
Hey, fellas.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:48.510
Is he in black and white?

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:51.076
Where's that wind coming from?
We're in a basement.

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.072
Wherever I go, the wind follows.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.994
And the wind, it smells like rain.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:57.996
Hi, guys!

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.517
This could literally not get any weirder.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.520
It <i>can</i> get weirder.

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:11.752
I just washed my hands.
That's why they're wet.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:13.794
No other reason.

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.239

So, uh, how did you get here?

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.957
Well, it's kind of a long story.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.240
Maybe not that long.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.871
And now we're just trying
to find a way home.

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:24.954
The only way home is back through
that collider gizmo. The only trouble is...

01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:28.557
One of us has to stay behind
and destroy it.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:29.836

I'm the guy who's gonna turn it off.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:48.230
And I'm gonna get you all home
before I do.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:52.519
Look, I made a promise.
So I have to keep it.

01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.390

This is Miles.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.951
- And he's gonna save the multiverse.
- Yeah, man.

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:05.750
This kid can turn himself invisible.
Watch this. He can do it now.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.599
- I can't do it on command.
- He can't do it on command.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.275

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.275
- Just those two things.
- Just those two things.

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.355
Aw, man.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:30.958
Look, I've seen him in action.
He's got potential.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.556
I think he's gonna get us home.

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:39.553
Okay, little fella, Kingpin's gonna send
a lot of mugs after ya.

I'm talkin' hard boys, real biscuit boxers.
Can you fight them all off at once?

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.071
I haven't actually fought anyone.

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:47.720

Can you close off your feelings

of your violent actions?

Can you help your aunt create

...so she can get out
of the dang house once in a while?

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.589
Can you float through the air

- Ruthless?

you get hit, can you get back up?

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.837
Come on, Miles. Get up.

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.351
You need to be more honest
with yourself about this.

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:41.281
- He's not ready. It's obvious.
- There's no way. He's just a kid.

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.720
If he can't do this,
we have to stay and do it for him.

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.831

- He works for Kingpin. He tried to kill me!

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:38.757
It's okay. We're gonna figure it out.

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:42.078

- No, I don't think so.

Well, we're the Spider gang.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:21.554
I want an APB on a new Spider-Man.

01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:52.829
Hey, bud.

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.470
You okay?

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:02.918
We've all been there.
You know, for me...

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:04.309
...it was my Uncle Ben.

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:09.231
For me, it was my Uncle Benjamin.

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:12.154
For me, it was my father.

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.835
For me, it was my best friend.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.199
Miles, the hardest thing about this job is...

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:21.711
...you can't always save everybody.

01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:26.032
Look, it was my fault.
You wouldn't understand.

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.199
Miles, we're probably the only ones
who <i>do</i> understand.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:33.440

Bye, Miles.

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:12.236
- Miles, I came to say goodbye.
- We can say goodbye at the collider.

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:14.392
You're not getting it.
You're staying here.

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:16.517
I need to be there.
So you can all go home.

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:19.912
They are going home, Miles.
I'm the only one stayin'.

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:23.519
You're taking my place?
If you stay here, you'll die.

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:27.071
I'm doing what needs to be done.
I just wanted you to hear it from me.

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:29.276
What about MJ?

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.990
Not everything works out, kid.

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:35.952
I need the goober.

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:38.319
Please don't make me take it from you.

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.989
That's not fair!
You gotta tell them I can do this.

01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:42.879
It wasn't their decision.

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:49.991
I gotta make Kingpin pay!
You have to let me make him pay!

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:51.656
Miles, you're gonna get yourself killed.

01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:53.080
But I'm ready. I promise!

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:58.232
Then venom-strike me right now.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:02.917
Or turn invisible on command
so you can get past me.

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:16.559
Look, I know
how much you want this, kid.

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:18.833
Poor little guy.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:24.677
But you don't have it yet.

01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:31.670
I'm sorry.

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:35.111
When will I know I'm ready?

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:39.360
You won't. It's a leap of faith.

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:41.480
That's all it is, Miles.

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:44.157
A leap of faith.

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:26.313

Miles, I can see
your shadow movin' around.

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:41.875
Yeah, okay, I get it. I get it.
You're still ignoring me.

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:44.556
Look, can we talk for a minute?

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:48.272
Something...

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:52.111
Something happened to...

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:58.436
Look, sometimes people drift apart, Miles.

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:03.318
And I don't want
that to happen to us, okay?

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:08.790
I know I don't always do what you need
me to do or say what you need me to say.

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:15.960
I see this spark in you.
It's amazing. It's why I push you.

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:18.398
But it's yours.

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:21.877

you'll be great.

this evening to celebrate Spider-Man.

It's not your MJ, Peter, okay?

- I'm sorry, I'll be right back.
- Shh!

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:05.752
Peter! Come here. Trust me. I've
been there. You gotta move on, buddy.

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:07.991
It will take one second. Let me just... Oh!

01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:10.994
- Hello.
- Oh, wow.

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:15.353
Um... I just wondered if we could have
some more bread at table 12.

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:17.516
Yeah.

01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:22.077
I'm just, uh... I'm really sorry.

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:25.234
Oh! Heh. Don't be sorry. It's just bread.

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:27.710
I wasn't there for you
when you needed me.

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.280
- Mm-hm.
- I didn't even try.

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:31.909
That's fine.
You know, I should really get going.

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:37.240
I know I could do better if I just had
another chance to give you, uh...

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:41.390
...the bread that you deserve.

01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:44.440
- Are you okay?
- We'll take care of that bread right now.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:46.751
Well, it's been nice, uh, talking to you.

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:49.719
For you, they should fill this place up
with fresh bread.

01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:52.076
- You all right, man?
- Oh, yeah. Totally.

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.120
Good, 'cause we are not
getting any bread.

01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:00.594

It's okay.

01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:09.632
I've made up my mind.

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:16.196
I'll put the goober in

01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:19.080

01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:02.959

- Spider-Man?

- It's about time, right?

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:32.856
- Look who's here!
- You figured it out.

01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:35.076
- I love you! I am so proud of you!
- Ha, ha, ha.

01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:37.118

01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:39.437

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.717

are coming to us.

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.352
We gotta get back up there.

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:39.712

or you just bumping gums?

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:25.070

That was adorable, team!
Now, hold on tight!

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:11.391
Buckle up, guys.
This is gonna take a while.

01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:16.919
All right. Never mind.

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:18.116

01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:21.233

Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:27.198
Don't watch the mouth.
Watch the hands.

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:33.079
- Miles!
- Be careful!

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:47.950
Whoo! That was crazy.

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:49.914
We taught him that, right?

01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:52.919
I didn't teach him that.
And you definitely didn't.

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:12.069
You okay?

01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:15.279
Come on.

01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:24.520
Guys, I got control of the beam!
Get up here!

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:29.119
<i>Alert! Quantum polarity
has been reversed.</i>

01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:36.474
Guess this is it.

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:39.951
Well, nice to know we're not alone.

01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:43.109
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:46.236
I got the portal open. You first, Peni.

01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:48.357
Thank you, Miles.

01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:50.671
From both of us.

01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:56.798
I, uh, love you all.

01:33:57.360 --> 01:33:59.750
I'm taking this cube thing with me.

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:01.832
I don't understand it.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.878
But I will.

01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:08.915
I want you to have this.

01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:10.834
It'll fit in your pocket.

01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:14.238
That's all, folks.

01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:17.313
Is he allowed to say that, legally?

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:22.678
Do I get to like the hairdo now?

01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:25.993
You know I'm older than you.

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:29.392
15 months, but it's pretty significant
if you ask me.

01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:33.276
Well, Einstein said
time was relative, right?

01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:35.955
Heh. Nice.

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:40.119
Friends?

01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:42.789
Friends.

01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:44.076
Cool.

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:45.873
See you around, Spider-Man.

01:34:57.040 --> 01:34:58.076
Your turn.

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:02.193
Yeah, yeah. Right.

01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:07.677
You're not going anywhere!

01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:10.271
I'll hold him off. You shut this down.

01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:11.920
Peter, that wasn't the deal!

01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:15.630
Push the green button!
Do not wait for me!

01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:21.511
- Ahh! What are you doing?
- You gotta go home!

01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:24.479
This guy could kill you!
I can't let Spider-Man die.

01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:26.393
Neither can I.

01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:29.749
It's okay.

01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:32.399
Yeah, it is okay.

01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:39.029
You gotta go home, man.

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:42.398
How do I know
I'm not gonna mess it up again?

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:44.520
You won't.

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:47.236
Heh. Right.

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.232
It's a leap of faith.

01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:00.556
Not bad, kid.

01:36:09.680 --> 01:36:10.716
Kingpin!

01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:25.550
Nope!

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:27.677
Sorry! That's cheating.

01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:31.030
<i>Adiós.</i>

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:41.631
I gotta get to that button.

01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:47.751
Oh, no.

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:50.276
Not so easy doing it on your own, is it?

01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:56.475
I can't wait to kill one more Spider-Man.

01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:01.797
- Where am I?
- What?

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.480
Wilson?

01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:06.599
- Is this what you want, man?
- What are you doing?

01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:08.911
Vanessa. Vanessa.

01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:11.515
- What are we doing here?
- I don't know, Richard.

01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:12.915
It's me. You know me.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:15.753
We're leaving now.

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:17.673
Don't go.

01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:19.280
Stay with me.

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:21.193
Please!

01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:29.080
You're not stopping this. Not today.

01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:31.751
I am stopping this. Right now!

01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:41.196
I need backup.

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.319
Come on.

01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:32.075
The real Spider-Man
couldn't even beat me.

01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:36.472
You're nothing!

01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:44.710
You took my family.

01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:52.639
And now I'm gonna make sure
you never see yours again.

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:13.879
Get up, Spider-Man.

01:39:16.360 --> 01:39:19.000
Get up! Come on!

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:29.071
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:42.715
I'll always have my family.

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:44.959
You ever hear of the shoulder touch?

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:47.236
What?

01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:52.520
Hey.

01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:06.558
Hey, Kingpin!
Push the green button for me!

01:41:55.760 --> 01:41:58.229
Miles? Miles? Are you okay?

01:41:58.400 --> 01:41:59.436
<i>Yeah, I'm okay.</i>

01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:01.630
You're probably busy...

01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:03.638
<i>No! I can talk, I can talk.</i>

01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:07.797
<i>Look, so I came by earlier because, uh...</i>

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.356
- Your uncle...
- I know, Dad.

01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:13.955
I am so sorry.

01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:15.679
Yeah.

01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.634
Do you know who did it?

01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:19.439
I thought I did.

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:21.353
But I was wrong.

01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:24.832
Look, Miles, what I said at the door...

01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:27.072
...it wasn't just talk.

01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:33.237
Look, you know, I was thinking
maybe we could find a nice wall...

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:36.518
...privately owned,
like at the police station...

01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:42.119
...and you could, um, "throw up"
some of your art.

01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:44.718
Man, I'm bad at this.

01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:48.233
Okay, Miles. Miles? You there?

01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:51.154
Oh, come on, man. C-Mobile!

01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:53.437
- Officer.
- Spider-Man!

01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:56.431
Listen, um, down there, that was...

01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:58.080
I mean, I owe you...

01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:00.596
Okay!

01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:09.797
I look forward to workin' with you.

01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:12.714
Heh, heh. Yeah, me, too. I guess.

01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:15.714
I don't approve of your methods...

01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:19.272
...but we're just gonna have
to agree to disagree.

01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:21.636
Thank you for your bravery tonight.

01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:23.516
- I love you.
- Heh, heh.

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:25.034
Wait, what?

01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:27.237
And look behind you!

01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:39.714
All right. Cool. Yeah.

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:42.634
- Thanks, Spider-Man.
- Spider-Man, <i>a su servicio</i>. Thank you.

01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:44.960
- Hey, man. What's up, little man?
- New Spider-Man.

01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:48.198
Yeah. Yeah, I'm the new Spider-Man.
Check it out.

01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:49.589
Whoa!

01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:52.270
That was part of the move.

01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:57.033
<i>Okay, let's do this one last time, yeah?
For real this time. This is it.</i>

01:43:57.200 --> 01:44:00.830
<i>My name is Miles Morales.
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.</i>

01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:04.556
<i>And for like two days, I've been
the one and only Spider-Man.</i>

01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:05.870
<i>I think you know the rest.</i>

01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:07.315
<i>I finished my essay.</i>

01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:10.671
<i>Saved a bunch of people.</i>

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:13.833
<i>- Got hit by a drone.</i>
- Ouch!

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:15.640
<i>I did this with my dad.</i>

01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:19.276
<i>Met my roommate. Finally.</i>

01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:24.636
<i>Slapped a sticker
where my dad's never gonna find it.</i>

01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:28.999
<i>And when I feel alone, like no one
understands what I'm going through...</i>

01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:32.078
<i>...I remember my friends who get it.</i>

01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:41.509

I'd be able to do any of this stuff.</i>

01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:43.080
<i>But I can.</i>

01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:46.438
<i>Anyone can wear the mask.</i>

01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:50.520

Little text might've been nice.

01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:38.256
I was gone for less than two hours.
What happened?

01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:40.192
Okay. I know what it looks like.

01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:42.750
- But here's the good news.
- Oh, here we go.

01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:44.673
The multiverse <i>didn't</i> collapse.

01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:46.354
- Oh, cool!
- Little touch and go.

01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:47.556
But it worked out.

01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:50.536
- Great story. Did you finish the goober?
- It's not a goober. It's a gizmo.

01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:53.296
Do you always have to call me out?
It's just really frustrating and bums me out.

01:55:53.320 --> 01:55:54.456
Don't get excited, Miguel.

01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:56.096
- It's just a prototype.
- Not excited.

01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:59.591
But you could be the first person

01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:00.631
Or the last.

01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:02.632
So we're just gonna roll the dice on this?

01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:05.634
So, what you do you say, pal?
Where you want to go first?

01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:08.554
Let's start at the beginning one last time.

01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:10.791

01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:14.880

01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:15.871
I'm Spider-Man.

01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:18.016
- I need you to come with me.
- Who the heck are you?

01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:20.350
I just told you...
Listen. I'm from the future.

01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:22.671
- How dare you point at me!
- You were pointing first.

01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:24.832
- It's rude to point.
<i>- You're</i> being very rude.

01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:27.153
Which one pointed first?

01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:29.118
Spider-Man pointed first. Obviously.

01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:31.136
- You're pointing at me right now.
- I'm not pointing.

01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:32.160
Look at your finger.

01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:34.136
I'm pointing out your pointing,
which is different.

01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:35.480
You haven't seen pointing.

01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:37.791
You're accusing me
of pointing while you're...!
