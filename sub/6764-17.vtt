01:35.261 --> 01:37.491
What's up, people?
Finals are finally over,

01:37.664 --> 01:40.098
and if you're smart,
you're getting out of here for the week.

01:40.266 --> 01:43.167
I will personally be Velcroed
to the microphone here at KXCU.

01:43.336 --> 01:46.237
But, well,
my life's in the tank anyway.

01:46.406 --> 01:47.930
Let's see,
I haven't slept in two weeks,

01:48.108 --> 01:50.372
I haven't talked
to my girlfriend in three.

01:50.543 --> 01:53.273
Well, actually,
I've told you all this already.

01:53.446 --> 01:57.473
Anyway here's a funky little track
that'll get us all feeling a little bit better.

01:58.418 --> 02:00.750
What's up, man? What are you
doing here at the crack of dawn?

02:00.920 --> 02:03.150
Actually, I'm here to talk to you.

02:08.161 --> 02:10.595
- What's up?
- I know you broke up with Donna,

02:10.763 --> 02:13.561
but I'm getting sick and tired of you
spilling your guts on my airwaves.

02:13.733 --> 02:15.758
Well, I'm a DJ.
It's called self-expression.

02:15.935 --> 02:17.061
It's called self-indulgence.

02:17.237 --> 02:19.728
And you may be the DJ,
but I'm the station manager, all right.

02:19.906 --> 02:23.069
So from now on, cut out the chatter
or I don't approve your playlist.

02:23.243 --> 02:25.177
Wait a second,
what's wrong with my playlist?

02:25.345 --> 02:27.336
It's depressing. Just like you.

02:27.514 --> 02:29.982
Okay, you're right. I'm sorry.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.675
Listen, man,
I haven't been feeling too hot lately.

02:32.852 --> 02:34.945
I can't sleep. I can't eat.

02:35.121 --> 02:37.419
Is there something you can get me
to take the edge off?

02:37.590 --> 02:40.286
- Like what?
- Some pills or something.

02:40.460 --> 02:42.052
What do I look like?
A walking drugstore?

02:42.228 --> 02:43.820
You want pills, go see a doctor.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.761
You're the one who gave me the meth
in the first place, all right?

02:46.933 --> 02:49.663
Now I can't think, my heart's pumping,
and I gotta get some sleep.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.770
It's easy. Stop doing the meth.

02:53.039 --> 02:55.405
And I want to see that playlist.

03:42.689 --> 03:46.455
- What do you think?
- I think I should go back to bed.

03:46.626 --> 03:48.059
Come on,
you said you'd help me pack.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.821
Can't you just throw everything
in a bag, Donna?

03:50.997 --> 03:52.555
Okay. Don't you love these boots?

03:52.732 --> 03:54.996
They're custom.
They took a mold of my foot.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.726
Wow, cool.

03:58.771 --> 04:00.534
I wish you were coming with us.

04:00.707 --> 04:04.234
I told you, when the temperature
drops below 40, I hibernate.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.038
Okay, but will you do me a favor?

04:07.213 --> 04:09.738
Will you just keep an eye on David?
I'm worried about him.

04:10.516 --> 04:12.814
He's a big boy,
I think he can take care of himself.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.112
I know.

04:14.287 --> 04:17.084
Maybe I should have invited him
to come skiing with us in Big Bear.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.920
Why? He broke up with you
and he's being a real jerk.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.757
Believe me, the best thing you can do
is just get out of town right now.

04:25.465 --> 04:28.628
- Speak of the devil.
- David, is that you?

04:29.002 --> 04:30.697
No, it's Saddam Hussein.

04:30.870 --> 04:31.928
Do you want some breakfast?

04:32.105 --> 04:35.438
Because I bought some muffins
for the drive. You can have one.

04:36.509 --> 04:37.976
See, he didn't even say hello.

04:44.417 --> 04:45.884
David.

04:46.886 --> 04:48.513
Hi.

04:49.055 --> 04:50.579
I don't wanna leave
with you mad at me.

04:50.757 --> 04:51.781
Well, I'm not mad.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.985
Well, there's still room in the van
if you wanna go.

04:56.162 --> 04:58.289
Well, it's too little, too late.

04:58.464 --> 05:01.126
Besides, I already told my dad
I'd watch Erin this weekend.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.496
So have a good time.
And don't think about me.

05:03.670 --> 05:05.103
That's a nice thing to say.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.469
Well, my life and what goes on in it
really isn't your concern anymore.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.736
Well, it is as long
as we're sharing an apartment.

05:14.947 --> 05:17.245
Look, David,
I'm just worried about you.

05:17.417 --> 05:21.581
Lately, you've been edgy and nasty
and you're driving Kelly nuts.

05:21.754 --> 05:23.984
Well, maybe I wouldn't be in
such a bad mood all the time

05:24.157 --> 05:26.751
if I had a girlfriend who was
capable of a mature relationship.

05:30.129 --> 05:32.597
So this is all about sex.

05:32.765 --> 05:35.233
Well, I'm sorry, David,
but there's more to life than sex.

05:35.702 --> 05:36.726
And how would you know?

05:38.738 --> 05:41.639
You know it just so happens
I will decide when I want to have sex.

05:41.808 --> 05:43.799
And I won't be pressured by you
or anybody.

05:43.976 --> 05:47.309
It's the same old song, Donna.
And it's getting really old.

05:48.648 --> 05:50.377
Hey, I'm glad
you're not coming this weekend,

05:50.550 --> 05:53.246
because I don't know
if I can stand the sight of you anymore.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.458
All right, yum.

06:03.830 --> 06:06.321
Here you go, honey.
I packed some snacks for your trip.

06:06.499 --> 06:08.364
Mom, Big Bear is only
two and a half hours away.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.024
Well, I didn't want you to get hungry.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.795
Hey, any of those funky brownies
in here?

06:11.971 --> 06:13.962
- Oh, did you want brownies?
- Steve, Steve, Steve.

06:14.140 --> 06:16.267
I'm sure whatever my mother packed
will be just fine.

06:16.442 --> 06:18.774
Hey, bad news. Andrea called.

06:18.945 --> 06:19.969
She's not coming.

06:20.146 --> 06:22.171
- Why?
- Well, she has the flu.

06:22.348 --> 06:23.576
Oh, that is bad news.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.411
She was looking forward
to getting away.

06:25.585 --> 06:27.985
Yeah, well, I have no one
to ski with now, unless, of course...

06:28.154 --> 06:29.348
Perish the thought, young lady.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.387
I will not be attacking
the bunny hill with you.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.582
Brandon, please.
Just do a few warm-up runs with me.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.990
Nobody's gonna do any skiing
unless we get out of here.

06:36.162 --> 06:37.186
That's right. Let's go.

06:37.363 --> 06:39.194
- You guys about ready to hit the road?
- Yeah.

06:39.365 --> 06:42.300
- Is Dylan gonna meet you up there?
- He's staying in town with his sister.

06:42.468 --> 06:44.698
- Fred Segal hair shirt?
- Nineteen ninety-five, right?

06:44.871 --> 06:48.932
Who could that be?
It's 6:45 in the morning.

06:49.208 --> 06:50.641
- Hello?
- Would you hate me

06:50.810 --> 06:52.209
if I didn't go skiing with you?

06:52.378 --> 06:55.279
Yes. Especially since
we're staying at your parents' house.

06:55.448 --> 06:56.915
<i>I'll give you a key.</i>

06:57.083 --> 07:00.780
- Donna, what's wrong?
- David and I had a fight this morning.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.913
- So, what else is new?
- No, it was major.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.490
He was so awful, Brenda.

07:06.659 --> 07:08.490
Donna, don't let David
ruin your vacation.

07:08.661 --> 07:10.390
- Our vacation.
- Our vacation.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.391
Look, we're packed
and we are ready to go.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.090
So we'll be at your place
in 15 minutes.

07:15.568 --> 07:17.001
I just don't want to be a downer.

07:17.170 --> 07:20.071
Donna, I'm not gonna let you sit there
and feel sorry for yourself, okay?

07:20.239 --> 07:22.935
Now come on, we'll have fun
and fun is the best revenge.

07:23.109 --> 07:25.168
<i>So we'll be right over, bye.</i>

07:25.344 --> 07:26.777
Bye.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.379
- Good job, sis.
- Let's go.

07:28.548 --> 07:29.708
Bye, guys, have fun.

07:29.882 --> 07:31.907
- Don't forget the grapes.
- Grapes, grapes, grapes.

07:32.084 --> 07:33.676
There you go.
Don't break too many limbs.

07:33.853 --> 07:35.787
Drive safely.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.513
See you.

07:41.761 --> 07:43.388
Alone at last.

07:43.563 --> 07:46.191
What do you say
we take in a movie this afternoon?

07:46.466 --> 07:49.458
I'd love to,
but I've got a dozen reports to finish.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.160
And I've got to call Dylan.
I really should meet with him today.

07:52.905 --> 07:53.929
Why? What's going on?

07:55.508 --> 07:57.976
I did some checking
on his new family.

07:58.144 --> 08:01.545
Credit check, assets, that sort of thing.
You know what I found out?

08:01.714 --> 08:03.909
<i>- Is it bad?
- This is Dylan. You know the drill.</i>

08:04.083 --> 08:06.551
Dylan. This is Jim Walsh.

08:06.719 --> 08:08.209
I'm gonna be around
most of the day,

08:08.387 --> 08:11.322
so if you're in the neighborhood,
I think you should stop by.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.927
I've got something
to talk to you about. It's important.

08:32.211 --> 08:33.235
It looks cold.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.140
That's why we have wetsuits.

08:36.549 --> 08:40.417
- Well, the waves look kind of big.
- Are you kidding me?

08:40.586 --> 08:42.076
These are what you call
ankle slappers.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.450
All right?
They're perfect for a beginner.

08:44.624 --> 08:46.489
We just ate breakfast, Dylan.

08:46.659 --> 08:49.127
Don't you think we ought to wait
another 30 minutes?

08:49.295 --> 08:51.763
Kid, I get the feeling
that you're stalling me.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.831
- Are you stalling me?
- No.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.059
- I love the ocean.
- Oh, you love the ocean?

08:56.235 --> 08:58.294
When did you ever see
an ocean in Iowa?

08:58.471 --> 09:01.440
<i>I didn't,
but I read The Old Man and the Sea.</i>

09:02.208 --> 09:03.470
<i>You read
The Old Man and the Sea?</i>

09:03.643 --> 09:05.543
One of my personal favorites.
I'm very impressed.

09:06.178 --> 09:08.009
- Back for another lesson, McKay?
- Oh, Bear.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.239
- How's it going, buddy?
- I got no complaints, man.

09:10.416 --> 09:12.714
There's no rip
and there's nobody out there.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.318
Including us.

09:14.487 --> 09:16.250
Bear, I'd like you to meet
my little sister.

09:16.422 --> 09:18.219
- Erica, this is my buddy, Bear.
- Hey, kid.

09:18.791 --> 09:21.089
- I didn't know you had a sister.
- Yeah, neither did I.

09:22.028 --> 09:23.222
Hey, I'll catch you out there.

09:24.196 --> 09:26.096
But I'll keep her. Come on.

09:27.533 --> 09:29.899
Mother, would you just calm down?

09:30.069 --> 09:31.969
I'm saying that
when Mel has Erin for the weekend

09:32.138 --> 09:33.662
you have to try to stay out of it.

09:33.839 --> 09:36.399
No, I'm not taking his side.

09:37.076 --> 09:40.102
Mom, I can't talk to you
when you get hysterical like this.

09:40.279 --> 09:42.076
Yes, that's exactly what you are.
Hysterical.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.408
Look, I'm hanging up now,

09:43.583 --> 09:46.416
and when you're done screaming,
you can call me back.

09:47.286 --> 09:49.049
Jackie is losing it.

09:49.221 --> 09:51.781
Don't we have anything to eat
other than cereal?

09:51.958 --> 09:53.448
She actually thinks that I'm a traitor

09:53.626 --> 09:55.526
because I'm going babysitting
with you today.

09:55.695 --> 09:58.493
- So don't come.
- I want to.

10:00.032 --> 10:03.661
- It tastes like cardboard.
- David, don't throw that away.

10:04.003 --> 10:05.061
Did you hear a word I said?

10:05.237 --> 10:07.933
Yeah, Jackie's losing it.
Which is her problem, not mine.

10:08.975 --> 10:11.205
Then what is your problem?

10:12.411 --> 10:14.174
Donna's right.
You don't eat. You don't sleep.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.678
You drag your ass around all day.

10:15.848 --> 10:19.011
And when you're not complaining
or yelling, you're climbing the walls.

10:19.185 --> 10:20.311
What's going on with you?

10:20.486 --> 10:23.512
Well, Donna and I just broke up,
I just finished finals.

10:23.689 --> 10:25.589
Mel and Jackie
are still at each other's throats.

10:25.758 --> 10:28.386
And if that's not enough,
I've gotta work all night long.

10:31.597 --> 10:33.121
David, are you doing drugs?

10:34.133 --> 10:36.465
- What?
- You heard me.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.104
I can't believe you.
Where do you get off accusing me?

10:39.271 --> 10:42.035
I'm not accusing you.
And I'm not passing judgment on you.

10:42.208 --> 10:43.903
I'm your sister
and I grew up with somebody

10:44.076 --> 10:45.907
who had a real drug problem.

10:46.078 --> 10:48.376
Well, I don't have a drug problem.

10:49.415 --> 10:51.144
But if I did,
I would definitely come to you.

10:51.917 --> 10:53.282
Listen, I'm fine, okay?

10:53.452 --> 10:56.512
All I really need
is a couple nights of real sleep.

10:58.190 --> 10:59.623
Come here.

11:00.693 --> 11:02.285
I'm sorry.

11:06.699 --> 11:09.964
Thanks. I needed that.

11:10.703 --> 11:13.103
So, what do you say
we go pick up our favorite toddler?

11:13.272 --> 11:14.296
Okay.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.204
Okay, so the pressure of the wave
is pushing you forward.

11:22.381 --> 11:24.781
You get on the front of the board,
do a pushup just like that.

11:24.950 --> 11:27.851
Swing your right leg over the front
and you are up.

11:28.020 --> 11:31.148
You are going, look at you,
you're a natural, it's a beautiful thing.

11:31.323 --> 11:32.347
Thanks.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.858
- So you ready to go for it?
- I can't.

11:36.028 --> 11:38.360
Sure, you can.
I saw you, you were just doing great.

11:39.265 --> 11:40.493
No, I can't.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.630
You can't what?

11:44.170 --> 11:45.467
I can't swim.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.137
You can't swim.

11:56.182 --> 11:58.673
Put the mirror into your mouth.
Let's look at your mouth.

11:58.851 --> 12:01.046
Looks like the dentist is busy.

12:01.220 --> 12:04.781
I'm glad you guys are here.
She's already pulled out six teeth.

12:05.424 --> 12:07.255
No more teeth pulling.

12:07.426 --> 12:10.395
- So where are you off to today?
- I think we're going to the park.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.258
Sounds great. Thanks.

12:12.431 --> 12:14.524
Oh, no problem.
We didn't have anything else to do.

12:14.700 --> 12:17.498
But I do have an appointment
for about an hour after lunch.

12:17.670 --> 12:19.228
Oh, great, now you tell me.

12:19.405 --> 12:22.203
Oh, you'll be fine, David.
Erin will take good care of you.

12:22.374 --> 12:24.535
- I'm sure she will.
- How's your mom, Kel?

12:25.010 --> 12:27.945
- Loony.
- So, what else is new?

12:28.114 --> 12:31.015
- Let's get out of here.
- Listen, you guys go ahead.

12:31.183 --> 12:33.674
- I'm just gonna go to the bathroom.
- Okay.

14:41.947 --> 14:44.381
Hi, looks like
you need some help.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.018
Yeah, something's wrong
with my left boot.

14:47.186 --> 14:49.620
I only made two runs
and I already have blisters.

14:49.788 --> 14:52.018
Why don't you take it off?
I'll have a look.

14:52.191 --> 14:54.455
I can't. I tried, but it hurts.

14:55.261 --> 14:58.662
These boots are valuable.
We either take it off or we amputate.

14:59.832 --> 15:02.062
I'll be slow and gentle.

15:02.868 --> 15:05.336
Okay, I'll be fast and nimble.

15:05.504 --> 15:08.268
No, no, no, wait,
it really hurts too much.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.704
Relax. You can trust me.

15:10.876 --> 15:12.241
I'm a world-renowned foot surgeon.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.574
I'm just working in this place
to put myself through ski school.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.045
Okay, on the count of three.

15:17.216 --> 15:20.708
- Okay, one, two, three.
- One, two, three.

15:21.587 --> 15:24.420
Wow, what a relief.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.251
- Thank you.
- No problem.

15:26.425 --> 15:27.915
I could put in some new padding,

15:28.093 --> 15:29.788
but the glue
is gonna have to dry overnight.

15:29.962 --> 15:32.260
Want me to rent you a pair
for the rest of the afternoon?

15:32.431 --> 15:36.424
No, thanks. I think I'm just gonna
soak my tootsies and call it a day.

15:36.602 --> 15:39.901
Well, can your tootsies wait?
I'm about due for my lunch break.

15:40.072 --> 15:43.872
- We could get something to eat.
- Sure.

15:53.886 --> 15:56.047
What seems to be the trouble,
Andrea?

15:56.221 --> 15:59.520
I don't know, I just have no energy,
my stomach's been doing somersaults.

15:59.692 --> 16:02.627
I feel like
I'm coming down with the flu.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.057
Hop up on the table.

16:04.229 --> 16:05.753
You know, I don't think it's colitis,

16:05.931 --> 16:08.365
because the symptoms
are more gastric than intestinal.

16:08.534 --> 16:10.695
But there's a slim chance
it could be pancreatic,

16:10.869 --> 16:12.632
since there's diabetes in the family.

16:12.805 --> 16:16.571
You wouldn't happen to be pre-med
by any chance, would you?

16:16.742 --> 16:20.143
- Sorry.
- Well, it probably is just the flu.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.143
Because everybody else
in your dorm has got it.

16:22.314 --> 16:25.772
So we're gonna take some blood,
and you take some chicken soup.

16:25.951 --> 16:27.509
Say "ah. "

16:29.021 --> 16:31.114
- What?
- Oh, sorry. Since...

16:31.290 --> 16:34.691
Since you're taking blood,
could I ask you to do me a favor?

16:35.661 --> 16:37.526
Would you mind giving me
an AIDS test?

16:37.696 --> 16:40.290
Have you been having unprotected sex
with high-risk partners?

16:40.466 --> 16:42.229
No, they haven't been high risk...

16:42.401 --> 16:44.301
Well, I mean,
I hope they haven't been high risk.

16:44.470 --> 16:45.869
I've always been safe.

16:46.805 --> 16:48.204
Almost always. L...

16:49.241 --> 16:51.505
I think I would just
feel better knowing.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.042
I understand.

16:53.212 --> 16:57.410
You're gonna need to fill out this form,
it's to ensure your confidentiality.

16:57.583 --> 16:59.016
We'll have results in 24 hours.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.584
Come in though, because
I need to give them to you personally.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.722
Thanks, I guess.

17:03.889 --> 17:06.653
I mean, is everybody this nervous
when they do this?

17:06.825 --> 17:09.156
Yeah. You probably have nothing
to worry about though.

17:09.328 --> 17:11.887
So just go home,
get under the covers, get some rest.

17:12.064 --> 17:13.190
And I'll see you tomorrow.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.699
- It's cold.
- It is not cold.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.867
It's gotta be 90 degrees in here.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.014
Lesson one:
Putting your face in the water.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.312
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

17:32.484 --> 17:34.816
I can't, my mom's tried to teach me
a million times.

17:34.987 --> 17:38.184
I'm afraid of the water. I always was.

17:38.357 --> 17:39.881
You can ask her
when she gets home.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.493
I don't want to ask her.
I want to teach you how to swim.

17:42.928 --> 17:45.522
Forget it, Dylan. I want to get out.

17:45.697 --> 17:46.891
My stomach hurts.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.796
Oh, so that's it? You're gonna
give up on it just like that?

17:49.968 --> 17:51.595
<i>What about
The Old Man and the Sea?</i>

17:51.770 --> 17:52.998
What about it?

17:53.172 --> 17:56.471
Well, Santiago would never
accept defeat.

17:56.642 --> 17:58.940
Santiago could swim.

17:59.111 --> 18:01.204
He was in that boat
for three nights and three days,

18:01.380 --> 18:02.870
doing battle with the galanos.

18:03.048 --> 18:04.811
I'm not Santiago.

18:04.983 --> 18:06.473
His right hand was cut and bleeding.

18:06.652 --> 18:09.382
His left hand,
it was cramped up into a useless claw.

18:09.555 --> 18:10.852
And still, he did not give up.

18:14.126 --> 18:16.390
Okay. I'll do it.

18:21.834 --> 18:25.201
- There, you happy?
- Yeah, very happy. Thank you.

18:25.737 --> 18:27.068
See, you're a natural, I told you.

18:27.239 --> 18:29.332
You've got the McKay blood
in your veins. Look at you.

18:39.885 --> 18:42.319
Look what I made you,
it's a lamb.

18:42.488 --> 18:44.251
It's a duckie.

18:44.423 --> 18:46.687
- It's a lamb.
- A duck.

18:46.859 --> 18:50.090
- It looks more like a duck.
- It's a lamb.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.092
Where are you?

18:54.199 --> 18:57.430
- What a pretty little girl.
- Thank you.

18:57.603 --> 19:00.470
Why don't you come over
and give me a great big hug?

19:01.340 --> 19:02.364
I'm sorry.

19:02.541 --> 19:05.374
- Would you like a cookie?
- Oh, no, thank you.

19:05.544 --> 19:07.978
Now just a minute,
I've got one right here.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.707
No, that's okay.
We have to go wash her hands.

19:11.450 --> 19:13.816
Come on, David. Come on.

19:15.387 --> 19:18.322
David, didn't your mother ever teach
you not to take food from strangers?

19:18.490 --> 19:20.151
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.

19:20.325 --> 19:23.488
- You can never be too careful.
- You're right, I'm sorry.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.290
You know
while I'm busy apologizing,

19:26.465 --> 19:29.832
I know I've been kind of out of whack
the past couple weeks.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.629
Well, I don't know
how you put up with me.

19:31.803 --> 19:33.395
Well, it hasn't been easy.

19:33.572 --> 19:35.802
Yeah, well, it's all behind me now.
Promise.

19:35.974 --> 19:37.532
Good.

19:39.411 --> 19:42.676
Erin! Why is she always
running off like this?

19:42.848 --> 19:43.974
Give us exercise.

19:44.149 --> 19:47.175
Erin, hey, hey, hey.

19:47.352 --> 19:50.844
I told you never run away from me
like that again, do you hear me?

19:51.023 --> 19:52.718
Promise?

19:52.891 --> 19:55.382
Okay, ice cream's on me.

19:55.561 --> 19:58.155
David, you're not gonna
give her ice cream.

19:58.330 --> 20:00.696
- Why not?
- Because that would be rewarding her.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.629
She's never gonna learn anything
this way.

20:02.801 --> 20:04.735
- Kelly.
- What, first the old lady, now this.

20:04.903 --> 20:07.701
If you're gonna take care of her,
you have to start setting some limits.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.637
Okay, fine. Let's not make
such a big deal about this.

20:10.809 --> 20:13.107
Now, what do you want?
You want a cone or a Popsicle?

20:13.278 --> 20:14.506
David.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.114
Kelly, I'm her big brother.
I'm allowed to spoil her.

20:18.116 --> 20:20.676
Fine, if you're such an expert,
you can take care of her yourself.

20:20.852 --> 20:22.319
I'm going to my appointment.

20:22.487 --> 20:23.818
- Kelly.
- What?

20:23.989 --> 20:25.957
Fill her up on ice cream.
Let her do what she wants.

20:26.124 --> 20:28.115
I'll be back in an hour.
Take care of your brother.

20:33.765 --> 20:37.030
That's all right,
we don't need her anyway, do we?

20:44.376 --> 20:48.745
- You didn't have to buy me lunch.
- I didn't, it's free.

20:48.914 --> 20:50.472
One of the better perks of the job.

20:50.649 --> 20:54.278
Along with free lift tickets,
a lifetime supply of ski wax,

20:54.453 --> 20:56.182
and the chance
to meet girls like you.

20:57.022 --> 21:00.048
Oh, so I'm not the first girl
you've taken to lunch?

21:00.225 --> 21:02.056
Well, you're definitely
one of the cutest.

21:02.227 --> 21:04.388
- Yeah, right.
- You are.

21:04.563 --> 21:05.894
And you especially have cute feet.

21:06.064 --> 21:09.158
Which is really important
when you're around boots all day.

21:09.334 --> 21:11.302
That's good to know.

21:11.470 --> 21:14.462
So you come up here a lot?
I don't think I've seen you before.

21:14.640 --> 21:15.800
Not this season.

21:15.974 --> 21:19.000
I usually do with my parents.
They have a house on the lake.

21:19.177 --> 21:20.508
Right on the lake?

21:22.614 --> 21:25.139
Let me guess.
The A-frame or the gray slate.

21:25.317 --> 21:26.784
Gray slate.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.886
Wow, that's the fanciest house
up here.

21:29.054 --> 21:31.022
- It is not.
- It is to me.

21:31.690 --> 21:34.853
But then again, I live in a shack
down in San Bernardino.

21:35.027 --> 21:37.325
Hi. I'm glad one of us is warm.

21:37.496 --> 21:39.760
- Bren.
- Oh, hot chocolate, fast.

21:39.931 --> 21:41.455
I think I'm going to die, it's so cold.

21:41.633 --> 21:44.124
Oh, Chad, this is my friend Brenda.
Brenda, this is Chad.

21:44.303 --> 21:45.429
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

21:45.604 --> 21:47.231
Chad works here.
He's fixing my boots.

21:47.406 --> 21:49.169
Well, thanks for bailing on me,
Donna.

21:49.341 --> 21:51.605
I'm sorry. How were the slopes?

21:51.777 --> 21:55.235
I wasn't exactly on the slope.
I was more on my butt.

21:55.414 --> 21:57.006
Well, I told you to take a lesson.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.814
You know, a buddy of mine
is one of the ski instructors.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.316
We both have the day off tomorrow.

22:01.486 --> 22:03.454
Maybe the four of us
could get together.

22:05.724 --> 22:07.316
- That would be great.
- Great.

22:07.492 --> 22:09.653
Listen, I gotta get back
to the salt mines.

22:09.828 --> 22:13.127
- You gonna be around?
- Yeah, I'll be right by the fire.

22:13.298 --> 22:15.391
- Good, I'll find you.
- Okay.

22:15.567 --> 22:17.558
- Bye.
- Bye.

22:21.773 --> 22:23.536
What's going on?

22:23.709 --> 22:26.803
What's going on
is that I'm having a good time.

22:26.978 --> 22:30.641
And you're right.
Fun is the best revenge.

22:54.606 --> 22:57.131
David, where's Erin?

22:57.309 --> 23:00.142
I don't know,
I must have dozed off for a minute.

23:00.312 --> 23:01.438
Erin!

23:01.613 --> 23:03.979
How could you do this?
You know she wanders off.

23:04.149 --> 23:05.411
Erin!

23:05.584 --> 23:07.449
Check the jungle gym.
I'll look on the swings.

23:07.619 --> 23:08.643
All right.

23:08.820 --> 23:11.311
- Erin!
- Erin!

23:11.490 --> 23:15.290
Have you seen a little girl
wearing overalls and a purple sweater?

23:15.460 --> 23:16.722
Okay.

23:20.198 --> 23:22.132
Have you seen a little girl?

23:29.541 --> 23:31.406
She wasn't there.

23:31.576 --> 23:34.204
Oh, my God, David. She's gone.

23:36.648 --> 23:37.876
Erin!

23:38.049 --> 23:39.676
Erin.

23:42.587 --> 23:45.021
- Erin.
- Erin.

23:57.068 --> 23:59.332
How long did you say
you were sleeping?

23:59.504 --> 24:01.597
I don't know. Twenty minutes?

24:01.773 --> 24:03.502
I just don't understand
how a little girl

24:03.675 --> 24:05.973
could have gotten so far
in such a short amount of time.

24:06.144 --> 24:07.907
It may have been longer.
I don't know.

24:08.079 --> 24:10.240
Actually, it doesn't take long
for a child to disappear.

24:10.415 --> 24:11.541
It can happen in an instant.

24:12.884 --> 24:14.545
If someone wants
to make her disappear.

24:16.021 --> 24:17.283
You think somebody took her?

24:19.291 --> 24:21.623
Let's go over what she was wearing.

24:24.663 --> 24:28.292
Denim overalls,
and purple sweater with flowers on it?

24:28.467 --> 24:30.662
- Yeah, that's it, right?
- Yeah, that's it.

24:35.373 --> 24:36.567
Mel.

24:36.741 --> 24:39.209
- What happened?
- She just wandered off.

24:39.377 --> 24:40.901
They've been looking for her
everywhere.

24:41.079 --> 24:43.980
It was my fault, Dad. I was supposed
to be watching her and I fell asleep.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.309
You fell asleep?

24:45.717 --> 24:47.582
David's very tired.
He hasn't slept in days.

24:47.752 --> 24:49.720
And I shouldn't have
left her alone with him.

24:49.888 --> 24:53.016
Excuse me.
Are you the child's father?

24:53.191 --> 24:57.287
Yeah, I'm Mel Silver.
I brought the picture you asked for.

24:57.462 --> 25:00.397
We've been trying to reach your wife.
When was the last time you spoke?

25:01.233 --> 25:02.427
Not for weeks.

25:02.601 --> 25:05.092
These days, my wife and I only
communicate through our lawyers.

25:05.871 --> 25:07.964
I understand
there are custody issues here.

25:08.139 --> 25:09.197
Yeah, there are.

25:09.374 --> 25:11.899
Is it possible your ex-wife
may have taken the child?

25:12.077 --> 25:13.101
Of course not.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.510
Let me handle this, okay?

25:17.449 --> 25:19.007
Jackie's been very upset lately.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.208
I know she was furious
with the judge

25:21.386 --> 25:23.320
when he denied her request
for sole custody.

25:23.488 --> 25:25.251
Mel, she would never steal Erin.

25:25.423 --> 25:27.482
Who spoke with Mrs. Silver last?

25:27.659 --> 25:29.923
I did, I'm her daughter.
And I talked to her this morning.

25:30.095 --> 25:32.256
Did she know
you were coming to the park today?

25:32.430 --> 25:33.590
Yes, she did, but...

25:33.765 --> 25:35.824
How would you describe
her frame of mind?

25:39.371 --> 25:41.771
She was upset, but she wouldn't...

25:41.940 --> 25:43.771
She would never do
anything like this.

25:43.942 --> 25:45.603
It's very common
in situations like this

25:45.777 --> 25:47.472
for children to be taken
by family members.

25:48.179 --> 25:50.807
Especially when there are
custody disputes.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.245
- How could she do this?
- Mel!

25:54.419 --> 25:57.149
Would you stop blaming Jackie?
It wasn't her fault, it was mine.

25:57.322 --> 25:58.880
If you want to hate somebody,
hate me.

25:59.057 --> 26:02.185
No, David.
No, it wasn't your fault, okay?

26:02.360 --> 26:04.624
And I don't wanna hear you
talk like this, do you hear me?

26:04.796 --> 26:07.526
Right now,
what we should be focusing on is Erin.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.096
Okay?

26:21.613 --> 26:24.673
Hey, you guys. Did you see
a little girl in there about 12 years old?

26:24.849 --> 26:27.613
- Yeah, and she's really upset.
- What's wrong?

26:27.786 --> 26:29.447
We asked her,
but she wouldn't tell us.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.353
- Is there anybody else in there?
- No.

26:33.525 --> 26:34.549
Okay, thank you.

26:34.726 --> 26:36.216
- Bye.
- Bye.

26:48.473 --> 26:49.735
Hey, Erica, what's wrong?

26:51.676 --> 26:54.076
Just go away.

26:54.245 --> 26:56.213
If you're not gonna tell me,
how can I help you?

26:56.381 --> 26:57.814
I don't want your help.

26:57.983 --> 27:01.783
Are you sick? Erica, are you hurt?

27:01.953 --> 27:04.615
No. Just go away.

27:05.857 --> 27:07.791
Open the door, please.

27:07.959 --> 27:09.722
Come on, open the door.

27:09.894 --> 27:14.126
- What's going on here?
- That's what I'm trying to figure out.

27:14.299 --> 27:16.699
Well, this is the women's locker room

27:16.868 --> 27:20.429
and if you don't leave this instant,
I'm calling security.

27:20.605 --> 27:24.371
Lady, you do whatever you gotta do.
I'm not leaving.

27:24.542 --> 27:27.875
- Have it your way.
- Wait.

27:29.080 --> 27:33.107
Please don't arrest him.
He's my brother.

27:33.284 --> 27:34.717
Could we have
a moment alone, please?

27:35.720 --> 27:39.622
Fine. The rest of us will just wait.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.396
You wanna tell me what's wrong?

27:46.898 --> 27:48.263
I'm too embarrassed.

27:48.967 --> 27:51.731
Okay. Look, just close your eyes.

27:51.903 --> 27:53.928
Take a big deep breath,
and blurt it out.

27:54.105 --> 27:56.039
Whatever you tell me, it will be okay.

28:01.312 --> 28:02.836
I got my period.

28:06.718 --> 28:09.050
Oh, well...

28:10.088 --> 28:12.750
I'm sure that you know what to do.

28:13.491 --> 28:16.255
I don't. It's my first time.

28:18.897 --> 28:20.888
I see.

28:21.499 --> 28:23.262
I wish my mom was here.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.362
So do I.

28:28.940 --> 28:32.876
But I think I know
the next best thing.

28:33.912 --> 28:35.539
Come on.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.754
- Is she okay?
- She's fine.

28:44.923 --> 28:46.891
She's better than fine, actually.

28:47.358 --> 28:50.191
You know, this is a very big day
in a young girl's life.

28:50.762 --> 28:53.754
Cindy, thank you very much.

28:53.932 --> 28:56.230
I had no idea what to do.

28:56.401 --> 29:00.201
- You know, she adores you.
- Yeah.

29:00.839 --> 29:02.272
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:02.440 --> 29:04.340
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

29:04.509 --> 29:07.478
I guess congratulations are in order
or something.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.274
Thanks.

29:11.116 --> 29:12.583
Do you think anybody could tell?

29:14.385 --> 29:15.443
Can tell?

29:15.954 --> 29:18.218
Come on, do I look different?

29:18.389 --> 29:22.416
Oh, yeah, yeah, you do.
You look... You look taller.

29:24.295 --> 29:25.819
Welcome to womanhood, Erica.

29:25.997 --> 29:28.557
I hope this doesn't mean
I'm gonna go boy crazy.

29:30.201 --> 29:32.692
Pace yourself.
You got plenty of time for boys.

29:32.871 --> 29:34.498
Yeah.

29:36.641 --> 29:39.041
This is a beautiful room.

29:39.210 --> 29:41.337
This is Brenda's room.

29:45.049 --> 29:47.347
Oh, here, I know she wouldn't mind.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.987
- Sure?
- Of course.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.025
I tell you what.
Why don't you stay for supper?

29:56.194 --> 29:58.253
I know Jim wants to talk to you.

29:58.429 --> 30:00.590
I thought you'd never ask.

30:02.901 --> 30:03.925
I gotta hand it to you.

30:04.102 --> 30:05.899
That fall you took
on the top of Widow's Peak.

30:06.070 --> 30:07.230
I thought you were toast.

30:07.405 --> 30:09.134
It's nothing compared
to the grace you showed

30:09.307 --> 30:10.831
with that kamikaze off the chair lift.

30:11.009 --> 30:13.102
Give me a break, my pole got stuck.

30:13.678 --> 30:14.872
Donna, where you been all day?

30:15.046 --> 30:16.980
She's been having
her feet massaged.

30:17.148 --> 30:19.343
New boots will get you every time.

30:19.918 --> 30:22.216
So you guys thinking about dinner?

30:22.387 --> 30:24.082
Maybe head back to the house,
grab a shower.

30:24.255 --> 30:26.815
I heard about this Italian restaurant
from one of my KEG brothers.

30:26.991 --> 30:28.925
Well, that sounds great. Let's do it.

30:29.093 --> 30:30.720
Actually, I'm not that hungry.

30:30.895 --> 30:33.455
- I'm just gonna hang here for a while.
- Donna.

30:33.631 --> 30:35.462
No, really. Go on, have fun.

30:36.201 --> 30:37.964
Well, if we leave,
how are you gonna get back?

30:38.136 --> 30:39.660
I'll catch a ride from somebody.

30:40.839 --> 30:41.863
Okay.

30:44.242 --> 30:46.608
Will you guys get the car
and I'll meet you out front?

30:46.778 --> 30:49.906
Yeah, but hurry up,
because I'm starving, huh?

30:52.784 --> 30:55.252
You'll "catch a ride with somebody"?

30:56.321 --> 30:57.481
Maybe.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.488
Look, Donna, you hardly know him.

31:01.659 --> 31:03.388
Why don't you come to dinner,
get some sleep?

31:03.561 --> 31:05.791
- You'll see him tomorrow.
- No, I wanna stay.

31:06.865 --> 31:09.356
Fine, just don't do anything stupid.

31:09.801 --> 31:12.770
Bren, I am not stupid.
Look, don't worry about me.

31:12.937 --> 31:13.961
I will be fine.

31:15.340 --> 31:18.036
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.173
I'm glad you came over, Dylan.

31:23.348 --> 31:25.873
I didn't want to have to
deal with this on the phone.

31:26.050 --> 31:27.813
What's up?

31:29.153 --> 31:33.954
Dylan, what did Suzanne tell you
about her financial situation?

31:34.959 --> 31:37.553
Pretty much
she was wiped out in the flood.

31:38.763 --> 31:41.960
Well, unless Suzanne Steele's
definition of destitute

31:42.133 --> 31:44.795
is a whole lot different than mine,

31:44.969 --> 31:46.698
she hasn't been telling you
the truth, Dylan.

31:49.507 --> 31:51.031
What are you talking about?

31:53.544 --> 31:56.980
She has $25,000 sitting
in a bank account in Davenport, Iowa.

31:59.250 --> 32:02.515
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry, be sure.

32:04.022 --> 32:07.549
It's her name,
it's her social security number.

32:09.694 --> 32:12.663
Look, Dylan,
I don't know what game she's playing.

32:13.364 --> 32:15.855
But she's got something
up her sleeve.

32:16.034 --> 32:21.165
I mean, she shows up here,
out of the blue, claiming poverty.

32:21.339 --> 32:22.670
She suckered you right in.

32:25.777 --> 32:27.335
Dinner's ready.

32:27.512 --> 32:29.275
And it smells really good.

32:30.181 --> 32:31.239
We'll be right in.

32:32.417 --> 32:34.009
Okay.

32:35.653 --> 32:37.177
Maybe there's an explanation.

32:38.056 --> 32:40.524
Dylan, just do me a favor.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.319
Be careful.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.477
Where is she? Where's my baby?

33:03.648 --> 33:05.411
- Mom, calm down.
- I am not gonna calm down.

33:05.583 --> 33:07.483
- Mel, what is going on?
- Where have you been?

33:07.652 --> 33:09.483
I got here as soon as I heard.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.349
- Mrs. Silver?
- Yes.

33:11.522 --> 33:13.581
I'm Det. Miller.
I'm in charge of the investigation.

33:13.758 --> 33:17.125
- Then find my little girl, please.
- We're doing everything we can.

33:17.295 --> 33:19.525
When was the last time
you saw your daughter?

33:19.697 --> 33:20.925
Friday night. Why?

33:21.099 --> 33:23.033
And you have no idea
of her present whereabouts?

33:23.201 --> 33:24.828
No.

33:26.104 --> 33:28.595
Why are you asking me this?
You think I took her?

33:28.773 --> 33:31.435
I don't believe this.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

33:31.609 --> 33:34.578
Mom, we were all just really worried
and we didn't know where you were.

33:35.613 --> 33:37.171
First Cabo, now this.

33:37.982 --> 33:41.850
How can you even claim
to be a father?

33:42.587 --> 33:43.952
I was the one watching her, Jackie.

33:44.522 --> 33:46.922
- This is a nightmare.
- Mom, try to stay calm.

33:47.091 --> 33:48.888
I will not stay calm!
My daughter is missing!

33:49.060 --> 33:50.994
Where is she?
What are you doing standing here?

33:51.162 --> 33:53.630
- Why don't you look for her, damn it?
- We've put out an APB.

33:53.798 --> 33:55.129
And we've notified the news media.

33:55.299 --> 33:57.790
They're our best weapon
in a situation like this.

33:58.302 --> 34:00.532
Oh, Mel.

34:02.607 --> 34:04.336
Does Erin have
any distinguishing birthmarks?

34:04.509 --> 34:06.238
A mole maybe or a scar?

34:07.145 --> 34:10.581
Yes. She's got a little birthmark
right here on her chest.

34:10.748 --> 34:12.978
And she has a tiny scar, here.

34:13.150 --> 34:16.018
Above her lip
from where she fell last summer.

34:16.187 --> 34:18.417
And she has
the most beautiful blue eyes.

34:18.589 --> 34:20.648
She's just like her sister.

34:20.824 --> 34:26.422
Oh, Kelly, I want Erin back.

34:26.597 --> 34:27.996
I know, Mama. So do I.

34:28.166 --> 34:30.464
We're doing everything we can.

34:40.344 --> 34:43.609
I would give up my life for that child.

34:43.781 --> 34:45.715
You know that.

34:50.788 --> 34:52.085
I'm sorry, Jackie.

34:54.158 --> 34:57.992
It's not your fault, David.
It's not anybody's fault.

35:18.816 --> 35:22.513
- Nice fire.
- You're nice.

35:27.558 --> 35:29.423
Very nice.

35:29.961 --> 35:32.828
You know,
it's a long drive down the mountain

35:32.997 --> 35:35.295
to San Bernardino this time of night.

35:35.466 --> 35:36.831
It sure is.

35:37.502 --> 35:39.936
We could go to your place.

35:41.205 --> 35:43.730
Or are your parents there?

35:43.908 --> 35:47.366
- No, they're not there.
- Well, then, sounds like a plan.

35:47.945 --> 35:49.674
Yeah.

35:51.249 --> 35:52.477
I can't do it.

35:53.384 --> 35:55.579
Well, what can you do?

36:00.591 --> 36:04.618
Look, Chad. I like you, I really do.

36:06.998 --> 36:09.296
But I have to be honest.

36:09.967 --> 36:11.525
I'm in love with someone else.

36:16.407 --> 36:18.500
How come he's not here?

36:19.343 --> 36:21.038
We broke up.

36:21.612 --> 36:26.242
And I thought I was over him,
but I guess I'm not.

36:26.951 --> 36:28.851
Lucky guy.

36:30.588 --> 36:32.522
He doesn't think so.

36:34.125 --> 36:38.084
I could always drive down to L.A.
And give him a kick in the butt for you.

36:39.530 --> 36:41.191
Thanks.

36:41.365 --> 36:43.492
But I think I'm gonna have to
do that for myself.

36:47.538 --> 36:49.631
I like being here with you.

36:50.808 --> 36:54.471
It's just weird being with someone,
besides David, you know?

36:55.413 --> 36:57.904
I sure wouldn't mind
seeing you again.

36:58.082 --> 37:00.880
You know, if things don't work out
when you kick his butt.

37:03.554 --> 37:05.681
Well, who knows?

37:05.856 --> 37:09.587
Okay. You know where to find me.

37:12.964 --> 37:13.988
Come on.

37:14.165 --> 37:17.396
I think it's time I drove you back
to that big house on the lake.

37:19.270 --> 37:23.206
You know, Chad, you're a nice guy.

37:23.507 --> 37:25.998
There are still some of us left.

37:43.928 --> 37:45.987
David,
would you please stop pacing?

37:46.163 --> 37:49.963
I can't. This is all my fault.
I can't believe I did this.

37:50.134 --> 37:53.331
David, they will find her.

37:53.838 --> 37:54.930
Sit down, David.

38:06.017 --> 38:07.041
Dr. And Mrs. Silver.

38:11.055 --> 38:12.579
I think we may have found
your daughter.

38:12.757 --> 38:15.191
- What?
- That was L.A.P.D.

38:15.359 --> 38:17.020
They found a child
matching her description

38:17.194 --> 38:19.890
at a house not far from the park.
They're gonna bring her right over.

38:20.064 --> 38:21.827
Oh, thank God.

38:21.999 --> 38:24.832
- What was she doing there?
- A housekeeper found her.

38:25.002 --> 38:27.163
She didn't speak any English.
Plus, there was a question

38:27.338 --> 38:29.829
about her immigration status.
She was afraid to call the police.

38:30.007 --> 38:31.099
- Oh, God.
- Thank God.

38:35.179 --> 38:37.545
- Erin!
- Erin!

38:37.715 --> 38:40.684
Oh, thank God. Thank God!

38:40.851 --> 38:42.785
- Oh, sweetie.
- Sweetheart, are you okay?

38:42.953 --> 38:44.614
- Are you okay?
- Are you all right?

38:44.789 --> 38:46.848
- We were so worried about you.
- Don't ever go away.

38:47.024 --> 38:48.457
- Yes, we were.
- We missed you.

38:48.626 --> 38:51.595
Oh, where did you go?
You mustn't run away.

38:51.762 --> 38:53.730
Oh, Erin.

38:58.569 --> 38:59.866
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:00.037 --> 39:01.868
Thought you weren't coming back
until tomorrow.

39:02.039 --> 39:04.564
Well, I caught an earlier flight.
I missed Erica.

39:04.742 --> 39:07.768
- Is she still up?
- No, she had a big day.

39:07.945 --> 39:09.037
She fell asleep early.

39:10.381 --> 39:13.475
Thanks for watching her, Dylan.
I hope she wasn't too much trouble.

39:13.651 --> 39:15.551
No, no trouble.

39:15.720 --> 39:17.347
She's got some news
for you, though.

39:18.989 --> 39:22.152
- What?
- I think I'll let her tell you tomorrow.

39:22.326 --> 39:23.350
Okay.

39:23.527 --> 39:26.758
Well, I've gotta crash.
I'm exhausted.

39:26.931 --> 39:31.265
- How was Davenport?
- Oh, pretty bleak.

39:31.435 --> 39:32.800
Well, people are still trying to,

39:32.970 --> 39:34.460
you know,
put the pieces back together.

39:34.638 --> 39:39.007
At least it snowed, though.
Everything's better in white.

39:40.611 --> 39:42.977
When were you gonna tell me
about the 25 grand?

39:47.618 --> 39:50.018
How the hell
did you know about that?

39:50.755 --> 39:52.416
Jim Walsh found the account.

39:55.526 --> 39:57.255
So you checked up on me after all.

40:00.464 --> 40:04.195
I can't blame you.
I guess I'd do the same in your shoes.

40:06.036 --> 40:07.333
Why didn't you tell me?

40:07.505 --> 40:09.336
I didn't know
when it was gonna come through

40:09.507 --> 40:12.772
or even if I was gonna get it at all.

40:12.943 --> 40:15.241
That's the insurance settlement
on my trailer, Dylan.

40:15.946 --> 40:20.781
The insurance company just wired it
into my account three days ago.

40:24.588 --> 40:26.522
Well, we'll clear out of here
tomorrow morning.

40:26.690 --> 40:28.749
I'm sorry we put you out.

40:43.641 --> 40:47.475
Here. I found this
with my stuff back home.

40:47.645 --> 40:49.738
I thought you might like to see it.

40:51.282 --> 40:52.806
Wow, he looks young.

40:57.788 --> 40:59.415
Do you want to know
the whole truth?

41:01.125 --> 41:05.562
I've always told Erica
that Jack McKay was her father.

41:05.729 --> 41:08.698
And I was seeing him at the time.

41:11.535 --> 41:13.628
I was in love with him.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.703
But those were wild days.

41:18.576 --> 41:24.537
And there's no way that I can be sure
that Erica really is his daughter.

41:26.717 --> 41:31.086
So if you're looking for guarantees,
there are none.

41:35.359 --> 41:39.159
- Mom?
- Hi, sweetheart.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.890
Oh, I missed you.

41:45.603 --> 41:48.367
I don't need any guarantees.

41:49.907 --> 41:51.534
I got a sister.

42:07.892 --> 42:09.689
What a day.

42:10.628 --> 42:13.096
One that I never want to relive.

42:15.366 --> 42:20.065
- It was all my fault, Kel.
- David, stop blaming yourself.

42:20.237 --> 42:23.570
We found her, she's fine.
It could've happened to anybody.

42:25.009 --> 42:26.101
I don't think so.

42:27.044 --> 42:28.068
What do you mean?

42:30.314 --> 42:32.179
I didn't just fall asleep. I crashed.

42:34.051 --> 42:38.715
- What?
- I started coming down, Kel.

42:39.423 --> 42:42.051
I've been taking meth for days,
ever since finals.

42:47.431 --> 42:48.693
I couldn't take it anymore

42:48.866 --> 42:51.164
so I stole some codeine
from my dad's office.

42:51.335 --> 42:55.362
I thought everything would be okay if I
got some sleep. But it hit me too hard.

42:57.708 --> 42:59.699
Oh, my God, David.

43:02.680 --> 43:06.207
Please, don't hate me, Kel.
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

43:07.151 --> 43:09.984
If Erin wouldn't have come back,
I don't know what I would've done.

43:12.489 --> 43:15.151
David, I don't hate you.

43:16.860 --> 43:17.986
I'm sorry.

43:19.897 --> 43:21.364
I know.

43:25.336 --> 43:27.497
I need you to help me, Kel. Please.

43:28.939 --> 43:31.430
I will. I will.

43:52.930 --> 43:54.989
I'm sorry I kept you waiting, Andrea.

43:55.165 --> 43:57.759
That's okay.
I haven't been able to sleep all night.

43:57.935 --> 44:00.233
I kept imagining such terrible things.

44:00.404 --> 44:03.862
Waiting for the results of an HIV test
can play nasty tricks on your mind.

44:04.575 --> 44:08.033
Well, there's no need to worry,
because you don't have AIDS.

44:08.212 --> 44:11.204
In fact, you're perfectly healthy.

44:11.382 --> 44:13.577
What a relief.

44:14.118 --> 44:17.576
I feel so much better.
So it was just a 24-hour bug?

44:18.422 --> 44:20.913
Actually,
more like a nine-month bug.

44:21.859 --> 44:23.053
Excuse me?

44:23.227 --> 44:26.424
Andrea, you're pregnant.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
