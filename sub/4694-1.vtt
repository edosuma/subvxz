this is my daughter's room.

This is all I have left.

This is not a room, sweetheart,
it's a museum.

we supposed to do?

No, it didn't.
We wanted it to, but it didn't.

And ever since,
we've been selfish.

our most prized possession.

35:18.240 --> 35:20.700
He was asking that man
not to take another drink,

35:20.868 --> 35:23.328
begging that bartender
not to serve it to him.

35:23.495 --> 35:25.955
He was hoping he'd call a cab,
go home with a friend,

35:26.123 --> 35:28.583
anything but get
behind that wheel.

35:28.751 --> 35:34.380

he cried, just like we did.

doing this, J.D.?

you know how Matthew said

that belief is an action?

Well, it's time
for us to act.

We've got to get back up
and start living again.

out there who need help,

35:59.198 --> 36:02.408

36:02.576 --> 36:05.078
And every time it rains,
they sleep wet.

36:05.245 --> 36:08.956
And every time it's cold,
they sleep cold.

36:09.124 --> 36:12.418
You're turning our whole life
upside down because of a sermon?

36:12.586 --> 36:14.420
No, no.

36:14.588 --> 36:17.590
I've been thinking
about this for a long time.

36:17.758 --> 36:19.550
That sermon
has given me the courage

36:19.718 --> 36:22.595
to actually
do something about it.

(Lily's mom)
Harry died
when she was just 4.

36:40.280 --> 36:44.826

not even gonna remember him.

36:44.993 --> 36:46.953
When he died, it was just--
it was so hard.

36:47.121 --> 36:48.913
I just wasn't prepared
for that much pain.

36:49.081 --> 36:51.374
It was like the bottom
just dropped out

36:51.542 --> 36:54.419
and I just
couldn't right myself.

36:54.586 --> 36:56.254
And, you know, I was,
like, a stay-at-home mom

36:56.422 --> 36:58.548
so I had to get a job,
and I did.

36:58.716 --> 37:00.174
But I had a really hard time

37:00.342 --> 37:02.260
finding people
to take care of Lily.

37:02.428 --> 37:04.387
And the hours were not good,

37:04.555 --> 37:06.389
and so I was late
to some of my shifts,

37:06.557 --> 37:08.599
and then I guess
I didn't show up once or twice

37:08.767 --> 37:11.644
'cause my headspace
was all, you know.

37:14.606 --> 37:16.733
So, they fired me.

37:18.402 --> 37:19.861
So, after that,
I did everything I could

37:20.028 --> 37:21.988
and I borrowed
from everyone I knew.

37:22.156 --> 37:27.326
But then that day came,
and I'll never forget it.

37:27.494 --> 37:29.287
We're walking down the street,
holding Lily's hand,

37:29.455 --> 37:30.913
we come to our building,

37:31.081 --> 37:35.585
and all of our stuff,
our entire life,

37:35.753 --> 37:37.879
is out there
on the sidewalk.

37:41.592 --> 37:46.512

37:57.941 --> 37:59.776

thought about how it happened,

37:59.943 --> 38:01.402
you know, to people.

38:01.570 --> 38:04.238
But there I was one day
without a home.

38:04.406 --> 38:06.491
Sure wasn't the way
I thought things would end up,

38:06.658 --> 38:09.327
I'll tell you that much.

38:12.706 --> 38:14.665

who knows.

of making bad things...good.

You don't believe?

In God?

away from us?

looking up already.

don't have to go.

appreciate everything,

staying someplace

go to dinner anymore

don't let it ruin your dinner?

saves these people,

when they wake up?

Thank you, Lord."

42:13.030 --> 42:14.488

Yeah, I get it.

42:14.656 --> 42:16.323
I grew up with these people.

42:16.491 --> 42:19.243
But you,
you've got a God complex.

42:19.411 --> 42:22.038
No, I don't.
This is not a complex.

I should get the credit,

57:51.634 --> 57:53.259
Mind if the two of us
join you?

57:53.427 --> 57:56.554
(Lily)
Sure, if it's okay
with my mom.

57:56.722 --> 58:00.558
She gets a little weird
about strangers.

58:00.726 --> 58:03.269
Yeah, that'd be fine.
Thank you, it'd be lovely.

58:03.437 --> 58:05.647
See you guys over there.

58:10.528 --> 58:12.195
Well, thanks
for letting us join you.

58:12.363 --> 58:15.073
Sure.
You're welcome.

58:15.241 --> 58:17.033
Well, for what
we're about to receive,

58:17.201 --> 58:18.868
and the gift
of our two new friends,

58:19.036 --> 58:21.746
may the Lord make us
truly grateful.

58:21.914 --> 58:24.207
In Jesus' name we pray,
amen.

58:24.375 --> 58:27.419
Do you always pray before
your food, Mr. J.D.?

58:27.586 --> 58:29.337
Yes, I do.

58:29.505 --> 58:31.881
Me too, even when they
run out of beds in the shelter

58:32.049 --> 58:34.592
and we have to sleep outside
in the parking lot.

58:34.760 --> 58:37.387
(J.D.)
Sleeping in
the parking lot? Huh.

58:37.555 --> 58:39.639
Well, that sounds like fun.

58:39.807 --> 58:41.266
Sort of like camping.

58:41.434 --> 58:43.893
No, it's not
really camping.

58:44.061 --> 58:45.520
We have a car.

58:45.688 --> 58:47.981
Mom calls it
the orange dork mobile.

58:48.149 --> 58:49.649
The orange dork mobile?

58:49.817 --> 58:52.986
[Teri and J.D. laughing]

58:59.994 --> 59:04.372
Well, that was quite nice,
wasn't it?

59:04.540 --> 59:07.292
I thought they
would look different.

59:07.460 --> 59:12.047
You mean like orphans
from a Dickens novel?

59:12.214 --> 59:14.215
Something like that.

59:18.429 --> 59:19.888
(lawyer)
Hey, hon.

59:20.056 --> 59:21.514
Hot date?

59:21.682 --> 59:23.141
New client.

59:23.309 --> 59:24.768
The wife
of an accident victim.

59:24.935 --> 59:27.228
Ambulance chasing,
not quite your style.

59:27.396 --> 59:28.897
It is when the victim
is forcibly converted

59:29.065 --> 59:30.899
to Christianity
while he's trapped dying.

59:31.067 --> 59:32.525
Forcibly?

59:32.693 --> 59:34.152
(lawyer)
Meanwhile,
his wife is restrained

59:34.320 --> 59:35.779
out of earshot by the police.

59:35.946 --> 59:38.490
Picture this:
a Bible-thumping EMT

59:38.657 --> 59:41.284
has poor Ron Carson
as his captive audience,

59:41.452 --> 59:42.911
painting him pictures
of hellfire and damnation

59:43.079 --> 59:44.537
in his final moments.

59:44.705 --> 59:46.247
Isn't that kind of
what they do?

59:46.415 --> 59:49.417
Maybe he was a believer, too,
and she just didn't know it.

59:49.585 --> 59:52.087
Both were members of the
American Humanist Association.

59:52.254 --> 59:54.923
Their motto is:
"Good Without God."

59:55.091 --> 59:56.549
I like it.

59:56.717 --> 59:58.927
But it still kind of seems like
her word against his.

59:59.095 --> 01:00:00.553
That's the best part.

01:00:00.721 --> 01:00:02.388
These Christian types,
you swear them in,

01:00:02.556 --> 01:00:04.432
they put their
hand on the Bible,

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.392
they actually tell the truth.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.311
Imagine that.

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:13.566
Hi, G-Ma.

01:00:13.734 --> 01:00:15.193
(G-ma)
Where is your brother?

01:00:15.361 --> 01:00:17.695
I don't know.

01:00:17.863 --> 01:00:20.115
Come on over here.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.623
My Pretty Boy.

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:32.377
You know, when
you were just a baby,

01:00:32.545 --> 01:00:35.255
I would sing you to sleep.

01:00:35.422 --> 01:00:39.801
Every night, the same song.

01:00:39.969 --> 01:00:42.971
I remember.

01:00:43.139 --> 01:00:48.434

Now you listen to me.

01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:29.434
You are not blind.

01:01:29.602 --> 01:01:33.479
You are not lost.

01:01:33.647 --> 01:01:38.985
You got voices pulling you
in all different directions,

01:01:39.153 --> 01:01:42.655
but there's only
one voice that matters.

01:01:42.823 --> 01:01:48.328
You listen for that,
you follow it,

01:01:48.495 --> 01:01:52.040
and you will be just fine.

01:01:57.463 --> 01:02:00.757
(pregnant girl)
So, how long have
you two been married?

01:02:00.925 --> 01:02:03.801
Matthew and I have
been married for 11 years.

01:02:03.969 --> 01:02:09.599
Can I ask why
you haven't had children?

01:02:09.767 --> 01:02:11.935
It's okay.

01:02:14.688 --> 01:02:16.147
I can't.

01:02:16.315 --> 01:02:19.859
There's this really
long, boring explanation,

01:02:20.027 --> 01:02:24.906
but it all just boils down
to that I can't.

01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:29.827
Of course, we thought about
adoption, but I don't know.

01:02:29.995 --> 01:02:35.166
It's just--I really feel like
a mother should be there

01:02:35.334 --> 01:02:38.044
when her baby is born,
you know?

01:02:39.588 --> 01:02:42.465
Hey, hon.

01:02:42.633 --> 01:02:44.092
Hi.

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.718
Hey.

01:02:45.886 --> 01:02:47.470
Surprise.

01:02:49.348 --> 01:02:51.182
You know, you can't go
just handing these things out

01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:54.185
and not expect things
to happen.

01:02:54.353 --> 01:02:55.812
(Pastor)
You're amazing.

01:02:55.980 --> 01:03:01.025
(Grace)
Oh, man, those onions--
they are, whew, getting to me.

01:03:01.193 --> 01:03:03.194
Yeah.

01:03:03.362 --> 01:03:04.821
Except this is celery.

01:03:04.989 --> 01:03:06.447
This is an onion.

01:03:06.615 --> 01:03:09.534
Mm-hmm, you're right,
but it's not cut.

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:15.290
[thunder rumbling]

01:03:21.797 --> 01:03:23.589
(Teri)
What are you doing?

01:03:23.757 --> 01:03:25.383
I'm gonna go get 'em.

01:03:25.551 --> 01:03:27.010
Now?

01:03:27.177 --> 01:03:32.015
Yes, now, while it's cold
and wet and raining.

01:03:33.517 --> 01:03:35.059
(Lily's mom)
Here, baby.

01:03:35.227 --> 01:03:37.145
I want you to be
warm enough, okay?

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:39.063
(Lily)
Yeah.

01:03:39.231 --> 01:03:40.690
(Lily's mom)
Your fever's gone.

01:03:40.858 --> 01:03:42.942
(Lily)
Mommy, we're leaking again.

01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:44.569
We are.

01:03:44.737 --> 01:03:47.155
Wait, I won't let it
get on you, okay?

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:48.781
Okay.

01:03:48.949 --> 01:03:51.826
I miss Joe.

01:03:51.994 --> 01:03:53.911
I understand.

01:03:54.079 --> 01:03:57.749
Mommy, could you
read me a story?

01:03:57.916 --> 01:03:59.959
It's too dark, baby.

01:04:00.127 --> 01:04:04.088
That's okay.
You just make one up.

01:04:08.552 --> 01:04:10.720
Samantha?

01:04:10.888 --> 01:04:12.472
It's J.D.

01:04:14.683 --> 01:04:16.142
What do you want?

01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:17.769
Well, I'd like to
offer you a place

01:04:17.936 --> 01:04:19.520
to stay out of the weather.

01:04:19.688 --> 01:04:21.314
How did you find us?

01:04:21.482 --> 01:04:24.776
(J.D)
Your daughter, she mentioned
you slept out here sometimes,

01:04:24.943 --> 01:04:28.154
and with the rain, I knew
the shelter would be jammed.

01:04:28.322 --> 01:04:29.989
So, I looked around
for an orange dork mobile

01:04:30.157 --> 01:04:31.741
and there you were.

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:34.660
Just because
we're on the street

01:04:34.828 --> 01:04:36.829
doesn't mean
that I'm a bad mother.

01:04:36.997 --> 01:04:41.542
That thought
never crossed my mind.

01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:43.878
Look, I don't mean
to appear ungrateful,

01:04:44.046 --> 01:04:46.089
but I need to know
what's going on.

01:04:46.256 --> 01:04:48.257
(J.D.)
Well, that's fair enough.

01:04:48.425 --> 01:04:52.720
See, my wife and I, we had
a daughter of our own once,

01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:54.764
but we lost her.

01:04:54.932 --> 01:04:59.519
We haven't felt anything
since then but her loss.

01:04:59.686 --> 01:05:05.274
Truth be told, well, we
need this more than you do.

01:05:08.112 --> 01:05:09.695
I really appreciate
what you're doing for us.

01:05:09.863 --> 01:05:11.322
Oh, don't you
mention it.

01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:12.990
It's our pleasure,
right, hon?

01:05:13.158 --> 01:05:14.617
Look, a dollhouse!

This was our
little girl's room.

01:05:18.539 --> 01:05:20.832
I put fresh
linens on the bed.

01:05:20.999 --> 01:05:22.458
Thank you, darling.

01:05:22.626 --> 01:05:24.544
Thank you.

01:05:24.711 --> 01:05:26.504
Don't worry.

01:05:26.672 --> 01:05:28.172
It'll be okay.

01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:30.007
Just make yourself
comfortable.

01:05:30.175 --> 01:05:31.634
We won't get in your way,

01:05:31.802 --> 01:05:35.012
and we'll be very quiet
when we leave in the morning.

01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:39.851
Well, if it's all the same
with you, we'd like you to stay.

01:05:40.018 --> 01:05:44.897
That is,
if you like it here.

01:05:45.065 --> 01:05:47.650
We'll see.
Thanks.

01:05:47.818 --> 01:05:49.986
Good.

01:05:50.154 --> 01:05:54.323
Well, that's fine with us.
Good night.

01:05:54.491 --> 01:05:56.284
Good night.

01:05:59.329 --> 01:06:01.456
Can I call them
Grandma and Grandpa?

01:06:01.623 --> 01:06:03.166
Not yet, baby.

01:06:03.333 --> 01:06:05.418
We need to see
if this works out.

01:06:05.586 --> 01:06:09.464
Well, but they like us,
don't they?

01:06:09.631 --> 01:06:14.510
I mean, isn't that why
they brought us home?

01:06:14.678 --> 01:06:16.596
Well, they were
gonna bring somebody home.

01:06:16.763 --> 01:06:19.640
It just happened to be us.

01:06:19.808 --> 01:06:23.603
I think we should
thank Jesus anyway.

01:06:23.770 --> 01:06:25.688
Come on, Mommy.

01:06:25.856 --> 01:06:29.066
I like being able
to sleep in a bed

01:06:29.234 --> 01:06:33.821
and not be afraid
to go to the bathroom.

01:06:33.989 --> 01:06:39.035
You're right, Lilypad.

01:06:39.203 --> 01:06:43.331
Thank you, Jesus,
for being so good to us,

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:49.170
for watching over us, and
for always taking care of us.

01:06:50.964 --> 01:06:53.799
What do you want to thank
Jesus for, Mommy?

01:06:53.967 --> 01:06:56.219
You have to tell him.

01:06:56.386 --> 01:06:58.804
For you, baby.

who runs this place.

Yes.

Thanks for seeing me
like this, Pastor.

01:08:05.372 --> 01:08:08.374
Sure.
How can I help?

01:08:08.542 --> 01:08:12.420
Well, listen, the other night,
this guy saved me.

01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:14.046
I mean, Jesus saved me,

but this guy was definitely
part of his plan, same as you.

talk that night,

it's like I knew
you was talking to me,

even though you didn't know
you was talking to me.

01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:25.933
What I'm trying
to say is this:

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:29.312
I asked the Lord to save me
and he did.

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:32.273
Which means
this ain't mine no more.

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:34.567
I want to do good with it,
'cause up until now,

01:08:34.734 --> 01:08:36.527
all it's done is bad.

to help people,

01:08:56.715 --> 01:08:58.174
Man, this is a bag
full of money.

01:08:58.341 --> 01:08:59.800
What's wrong with you?

01:08:59.968 --> 01:09:02.053
Hey, take it easy.

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:05.890
Listen, last night
I was reading

01:09:06.058 --> 01:09:07.600
on when Jesus got killed.

01:09:07.768 --> 01:09:10.269
That Judas guy, he gave the
money back to the church,

01:09:10.437 --> 01:09:14.189
but they couldn't keep it, so
they did something else with
it.

01:09:14.358 --> 01:09:16.149
The way I see it
is like this:

01:09:16.318 --> 01:09:20.154
the money is sin,
and the wages of sin is death.

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:22.782
So me holding on to this money
is like me asking for death,

01:09:22.948 --> 01:09:25.533
but not just dying.

01:09:25.702 --> 01:09:29.663
More like hell and damnation.

01:09:29.831 --> 01:09:31.582
You have been reading.

01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:33.250
Well, yeah.

01:09:33.417 --> 01:09:36.045
I kind of stole this
from the motel last night.

01:09:36.212 --> 01:09:40.131
That's all right.
That's what they're for.

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:41.926
Would that I were Solomon.

01:09:42.094 --> 01:09:43.551
(Pretty Boy)
If you were who?

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.179
Solomon.

01:09:45.346 --> 01:09:46.805
He was the wisest of men.

01:09:46.973 --> 01:09:51.018
He knew how to solve
the most difficult problems.

01:09:51.185 --> 01:09:52.853
(Pretty Boy)
This don't seem
that difficult to me,

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:54.939
and if your boy
is as wise as you say,

01:09:55.107 --> 01:09:57.483
he would take this money.

01:10:00.737 --> 01:10:05.366
Well, maybe you're right.

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:08.035
Maybe he would take it.

01:10:11.456 --> 01:10:13.749
And he'd give it away.

01:10:13.917 --> 01:10:15.501
Word.

01:10:16.378 --> 01:10:18.629
(male thug)
Only one way to find out.
All right, you know.

01:10:18.797 --> 01:10:20.339
Yeah, it's gonna be
cold, man.

01:10:20.507 --> 01:10:21.966
Whoa, Ski, Ski, Ski.

01:10:22.134 --> 01:10:23.592
Is that Pretty Boy
over there?

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:25.428
(male thug)
You got to be
kidding me, man.

01:10:25.595 --> 01:10:27.054
He got some nerve.

01:10:27.222 --> 01:10:29.473
(female thug)
What, does this man have
a death wish or something?

01:10:29.641 --> 01:10:31.308
He has to.

01:10:31.476 --> 01:10:32.935
Yo, Kriminal.

01:10:33.103 --> 01:10:34.562
You ain't gonna
believe this, man.

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:36.188
We seen Pretty Boy
walking out the church.

01:10:36.356 --> 01:10:37.815
Church?
What church?

01:10:37.983 --> 01:10:41.444
The one on 17th.

01:10:41.611 --> 01:10:43.863
You know, my aunt got saved
by one of those TV preachers

01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:45.656
when we was kids.

01:10:45.824 --> 01:10:48.033
Want to know what was
the first thing she done?

01:10:48.201 --> 01:10:49.702
(male thug on phone)
Mm-mm.

01:10:49.870 --> 01:10:52.413
Gave that man on TV
every dime she had.

01:10:52.581 --> 01:10:54.039
(male thug on phone)
So you're saying--

01:10:54.207 --> 01:10:56.333
(Keshawn on phone)
Sheep follow the shepherd.

01:10:56.501 --> 01:10:59.545
I'm guessing the shepherd's
got my money.

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:04.550
(ultrasound technician)
This is gonna feel
a little cold.

01:11:04.718 --> 01:11:06.177
(pregnant girl)
Okay.

01:11:06.344 --> 01:11:07.803
Are you ready
to see your baby?

01:11:07.971 --> 01:11:10.222
Yes.

01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:11.849
(ultrasound technician)
Okay, does that
feel okay?

01:11:12.017 --> 01:11:14.143
(pregnant girl)
Mm-hmm.

01:11:14.311 --> 01:11:16.061
(Grace)
You're gonna be great.

01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:20.524
[baby's heart beating]

01:11:27.199 --> 01:11:32.912
(ultrasound technician)
That's your little girl.

01:11:33.079 --> 01:11:36.207
She's beautiful.

01:11:36.374 --> 01:11:38.334
(Grace)
She is.

01:11:42.214 --> 01:11:45.007
You're gonna do great.

01:11:45.175 --> 01:11:47.760
It's gonna be okay.

01:11:49.304 --> 01:11:51.263
(ultrasound technician)
Congratulations.

01:11:51.431 --> 01:11:53.307
(pregnant girl)
Thanks.

01:11:54.851 --> 01:11:56.310
(Lily)
Welcome back to
"The Lily Show"

01:11:56.478 --> 01:11:58.062
on how to do gymnastics.

01:11:58.230 --> 01:12:02.775
Get ready for the
world's greatest handstand,

01:12:02.943 --> 01:12:06.195
into a back bend,
into a somersault,

01:12:06.363 --> 01:12:10.324
into a cartwheel,
into a one-handed cartwheel,

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:13.035
into the splits!

01:12:13.203 --> 01:12:14.662
[clapping]

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:16.288
That was awesome.

01:12:16.456 --> 01:12:17.915
Thank you.

01:12:18.083 --> 01:12:19.542
(Teri)
That was so impressive.

01:12:19.709 --> 01:12:21.293
Thank you very much.

01:12:23.547 --> 01:12:27.007
Wow, she's so pretty.

01:12:27.175 --> 01:12:30.052
(Teri)
Yes, she was.

01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:34.014
I'll try not to remind you
of her too much.

01:12:34.182 --> 01:12:36.308
Oh, sweetheart.

01:12:36.476 --> 01:12:37.935
Listen, you just
be yourself

01:12:38.103 --> 01:12:39.562
and everything's
gonna be okay.

01:12:39.729 --> 01:12:41.689
(Lily)
Okay.

01:12:41.857 --> 01:12:48.362
[singing and playing]

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:51.365
[clapping]

01:12:51.533 --> 01:12:53.742
Bravo, bravo.

01:13:02.919 --> 01:13:04.378
Where you going?

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:06.005
Preliminary hearing.

01:13:06.172 --> 01:13:10.259
The union wants to hear
my side of the story.

01:13:10.427 --> 01:13:11.886
Have you decided
what that's gonna be?

01:13:12.053 --> 01:13:13.512
The truth.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.139
(Elena)
Which truth?

01:13:15.307 --> 01:13:16.765
The one that's
gonna keep you working,

01:13:16.933 --> 01:13:18.392
or the one that's
gonna get you fired?

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.019
I didn't know there
were different versions

01:13:20.186 --> 01:13:21.645
to choose from.

01:13:21.813 --> 01:13:25.441
Amor, I'm gonna
ask this one last time.

01:13:25.609 --> 01:13:27.943
Please don't do this, Bobby.

01:13:28.111 --> 01:13:29.570
I don't have a choice.

01:13:29.738 --> 01:13:31.572
(Elena)
What do you mean
you don't have a choice?

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.198
You're making one.

01:13:33.366 --> 01:13:35.242
You've been making
a lot of choices lately.

01:13:35.410 --> 01:13:36.869
What does that mean?

01:13:37.037 --> 01:13:38.495
Bobby, you started
going to church

01:13:38.663 --> 01:13:40.331
without even asking me
how I felt about it.

01:13:40.498 --> 01:13:41.957
We talked about that.

01:13:42.125 --> 01:13:43.584
We talked about it,
but you decided that.

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:45.210
You did it on your own.

01:13:45.378 --> 01:13:47.046
You risk your life every day
for strangers, Bobby.

01:13:47.213 --> 01:13:48.672
What about us?

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.299
What about me, Bobby?

01:13:50.467 --> 01:13:51.926
You're about to throw
everything away,

01:13:52.093 --> 01:13:53.552
but, hey,
you have no choice, right?

01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:55.387
I am trying to do
the right thing here.

01:13:55.555 --> 01:13:57.014
At least
think about the kids.

01:13:57.182 --> 01:13:58.641
Will you do that?

01:13:58.808 --> 01:14:00.267
Just think about the kids.

01:14:00.435 --> 01:14:01.894
I am thinking about
the boys

01:14:02.062 --> 01:14:05.481
and how I want them to behave
when they become men.

01:14:09.736 --> 01:14:13.197
Well, it looks like
you've made up your mind.

01:14:13.365 --> 01:14:15.950
I hope it all
works out, Bobby.

01:14:30.715 --> 01:14:32.549
(female 3)
What made you want
to become a Marine?

01:14:32.717 --> 01:14:34.176
(Carlos)
Honestly, the billboard.

01:14:34.344 --> 01:14:35.803
What?

01:14:35.971 --> 01:14:38.013
Yeah, when I was a kid,
I used to see it.

01:14:38.181 --> 01:14:39.890
I'd see the uniform
and the sword.

01:14:40.058 --> 01:14:41.767
Just looked cool?

01:14:41.935 --> 01:14:43.602
Listen, if I could've been
the first 8-year-old marine,

01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:45.229
I would have.

01:14:45.397 --> 01:14:46.855
I love being a Devil Dog.

01:14:47.023 --> 01:14:50.901
What happened?

01:14:51.069 --> 01:14:53.696
Things changed.

01:14:53.863 --> 01:14:58.158
Or you got tired
of being a hero?

01:14:58.326 --> 01:15:00.661
Yeah.

01:15:00.829 --> 01:15:06.125
You know,
the funny thing about war,

01:15:06.292 --> 01:15:12.214
it shows you who you are,
not who you want to be.

01:15:12.382 --> 01:15:16.260
You could talk to me
if you want.

01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:25.811
One morning, we're near
this place called Shebesha,

01:15:25.979 --> 01:15:29.356
about 11,000 feet up
on this mountainside,

01:15:29.524 --> 01:15:30.983
about to get overrun.

01:15:31.151 --> 01:15:32.609
Then out of nowhere,

01:15:32.777 --> 01:15:35.738
this chopper just comes down
the valley, chain gun blazing.

01:15:35.905 --> 01:15:40.075
And they're there
to get us out of there.

01:15:40.243 --> 01:15:41.702
It turned out,

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:45.748
the pilot was actually
a really good buddy of mine.

01:15:45.915 --> 01:15:50.544
Sam, this big ol'
Korean guy.

01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:52.463
Always smiling.

01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:56.300
Always smiling, man,
even then.

01:15:56.468 --> 01:15:58.427
Anyways,
just shy of the perimeter,

01:15:58.595 --> 01:16:00.721
an RPG found them,
took them down.

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:05.267
Copilot, crew chief,
they were both gone right away.

01:16:08.104 --> 01:16:12.733
But Sam, he was
stuck up in the cockpit.

01:16:15.153 --> 01:16:18.489
I wanted to save him.

01:16:18.656 --> 01:16:23.535
I mean, he came to save me,
but I was too scared.

01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:29.500
And he died.

01:16:32.378 --> 01:16:36.882
And now I just see it
over and over and over.

01:16:42.472 --> 01:16:44.932
I don't know,
maybe I deserve it.

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.558
My punishment.

01:16:46.726 --> 01:16:48.310
(female 3)
No.

01:16:49.687 --> 01:16:55.275
I don't know what you did
or didn't do over there,

01:16:55.443 --> 01:16:58.070
but I know that
you saved me.

01:16:58.238 --> 01:17:00.906
So, that counts
for something.

01:17:01.074 --> 01:17:02.658
I don't know
how I saved you.

01:17:02.826 --> 01:17:05.911
I didn't do anything.

01:17:06.079 --> 01:17:07.788
I'm here.

01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:15.170
All right,
what do we got?

01:17:15.338 --> 01:17:17.422
Fever is 104.6.

01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:19.133
He's burning up.

01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:21.552
Any conditions
I should know about?

01:17:21.719 --> 01:17:23.178
Yeah.

01:17:23.346 --> 01:17:26.223
T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia.

01:17:26.391 --> 01:17:28.475
Stage four.

01:17:28.643 --> 01:17:30.227
(doctor)
What's the name
of your oncologist?

01:17:30.395 --> 01:17:34.857
(Joe)
Dr. Emil Martenek.

01:17:35.024 --> 01:17:39.236
Statesville Correctional Center.

01:17:39.404 --> 01:17:41.780
(doctor)
So I assume that means
you're on compassion leave?

01:17:41.948 --> 01:17:43.407
What kind of treatment
you been getting

01:17:43.575 --> 01:17:45.159
since you were released?

01:17:45.326 --> 01:17:47.035
Mostly praying.

01:17:47.203 --> 01:17:50.706
I did come in the other night,
but I didn't get treated,

01:17:50.874 --> 01:17:54.251
so I ended up
sleeping outdoors.

01:17:54.419 --> 01:17:56.920
Well, let's lay you down.

01:17:57.088 --> 01:17:58.839
You're living
on borrowed time

01:17:59.007 --> 01:18:00.924
with a highly compromised
immune system,

01:18:01.092 --> 01:18:03.135
and you decide
to spend the night outside.

01:18:03.303 --> 01:18:04.761
It's complicated.

01:18:04.929 --> 01:18:06.388
There's an infection
roaring through your body

01:18:06.556 --> 01:18:08.557
and it's highly unlikely
I can stop it.

01:18:08.725 --> 01:18:11.810
I'm gonna admit you,
make you comfortable.

01:18:11.978 --> 01:18:13.437
That's about
all I can promise.

01:18:13.605 --> 01:18:15.480
(Joe)
It's okay, doc.
I knew it was coming.

01:18:15.648 --> 01:18:17.274
(doctor)
Well, your little
camping adventure

01:18:17.442 --> 01:18:18.901
probably shaved your
time from a few weeks

01:18:19.068 --> 01:18:21.445
down to a couple of days,
if that.

01:18:21.613 --> 01:18:23.906
It was worth it.

01:18:26.659 --> 01:18:28.952
Now I'm going downstairs.

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:30.746
Down, down, down, down.

01:18:30.914 --> 01:18:33.207
I guess I can do it
for myself.

01:18:33.374 --> 01:18:34.958
Okay.

01:18:35.418 --> 01:18:36.877
Hi.

01:18:37.045 --> 01:18:38.503
Yeah, can I help you?

01:45:27.028 --> 01:45:28.487
Joe Phillips.

01:45:28.655 --> 01:45:30.572
The one whose certificate
I just signed?

01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:32.950
Did I miss something?

01:45:33.117 --> 01:45:34.827
You could say that.

01:45:35.662 --> 01:45:37.120
I don't understand.

01:45:37.288 --> 01:45:38.872
He's been dead for what,
like, 8 minutes?

01:45:44.128 --> 01:45:46.338
All right, Joe.

01:45:59.769 --> 01:46:01.353
How do you feel?

01:46:01.521 --> 01:46:04.690
Amazing.

01:46:04.858 --> 01:46:06.316
Run a full panel.

01:46:06.484 --> 01:46:08.944
CBC blood cultures,
the works.

01:46:09.112 --> 01:46:10.571
I want an accurate
identification

01:46:10.738 --> 01:46:12.197
of what this infection is.

01:46:12.365 --> 01:46:13.824
(Elena)
Yes, doctor.

01:46:13.992 --> 01:46:15.492
(Joe)
Doc, you're not
gonna find anything.

01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:17.327
(Elena)
It's a miracle.

01:46:17.495 --> 01:46:19.079
It is.

01:46:19.873 --> 01:46:24.001
There's no such thing
as miracles.

01:46:24.168 --> 01:46:27.754
Do you have
a better theory, doctor?

01:46:27.922 --> 01:46:29.631
Not yet.

01:46:29.799 --> 01:46:33.969
"For though they have eyes,
they will not see.

01:46:34.137 --> 01:46:39.057
For though they have ears,
they will not hear."

01:46:39.225 --> 01:46:42.853
Whatever this is,
the answer isn't in the Bible.

01:46:43.021 --> 01:46:44.980
Okay, doc.

01:46:45.148 --> 01:46:47.774
But the man whose death
certificate you just signed

01:46:47.942 --> 01:46:52.613
is sitting right here,
talking to you,

01:46:52.780 --> 01:46:55.866
and you don't wanna
believe in miracles?

01:47:01.205 --> 01:47:06.209
I'm just saying,
you might want to reconsider.

01:47:07.253 --> 01:47:09.379
That's a nice thought, Joe.

01:47:09.547 --> 01:47:12.215
I'm glad you're awake.

01:47:25.730 --> 01:47:28.023
I get a second chance.

01:47:40.244 --> 01:47:42.204
[door buzzing]

01:47:46.042 --> 01:47:49.711
You want to grab a coffee,
on me this time?

01:47:49.879 --> 01:47:51.505
You came back!

01:47:51.673 --> 01:47:54.383
He brought you
back to me.

01:47:59.055 --> 01:48:00.514
Are you okay?

01:48:00.682 --> 01:48:02.140
I think so.

01:48:02.308 --> 01:48:03.767
Yeah?

01:48:03.935 --> 01:48:05.394
Come on.

01:48:05.561 --> 01:48:07.062
What happened?

01:48:07.230 --> 01:48:08.855
It's a long story.

01:48:13.778 --> 01:48:15.362
We've got him.

01:48:24.497 --> 01:48:27.290
(Bobby)
Hey.

01:48:27.458 --> 01:48:31.211
What are you doing?

01:48:31.379 --> 01:48:33.880
Praying.

01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:38.385
More like apologizing.

01:48:41.723 --> 01:48:47.602
Tonight I saw a miracle,
a real live miracle.

01:48:47.770 --> 01:48:50.897
And it made me realize
how I was acting,

01:48:51.065 --> 01:48:54.818
like the God who did that

01:48:54.986 --> 01:49:00.157
somehow wouldn't
be there for us.

01:49:00.324 --> 01:49:01.783
I felt so ashamed.

01:49:01.951 --> 01:49:03.410
No.

01:49:03.578 --> 01:49:09.332
(Elena)
I don't want to live my life
like this anymore.

01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:12.044
I want to give
all of my life to Jesus.

01:49:12.211 --> 01:49:15.130
No more holding back.

01:49:20.595 --> 01:49:23.930
(Bobby)
I'm the one who
should be apologizing.

01:49:24.098 --> 01:49:26.266
I spent so much time sharing
my faith with other people,

01:49:26.434 --> 01:49:32.689
I somehow lost sight of you.

01:49:32.857 --> 01:49:34.900
Forgive me.

01:49:35.068 --> 01:49:36.651
Deal.

01:49:46.412 --> 01:49:48.663
Want to pray with me?

01:49:48.831 --> 01:49:50.874
Gladly.

(Samantha)
Lily! Baby!

01:50:07.934 --> 01:50:09.684
Oh, I was so worried
about you.

01:50:09.852 --> 01:50:11.645
So worried!
Are you okay?

01:50:11.813 --> 01:50:14.731
(Lily)
Yeah, we had a little accident,
but I'm fine.

01:50:14.899 --> 01:50:17.192
I'd say so.

01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:20.195
Hey, I think somebody over
there might like to see you.

01:50:20.363 --> 01:50:22.114
(Lily)
Joe!

01:50:22.281 --> 01:50:24.241
Hey, my little butterfly.

01:50:24.408 --> 01:50:25.951
You're looking better.

01:50:26.119 --> 01:50:27.577
Thank you.

01:50:27.745 --> 01:50:30.580
(Lily)
Look, I brought
your angel back to you.

01:50:30.748 --> 01:50:32.457
Yes, you did.

01:50:32.625 --> 01:50:36.419
But you keep it.
It's for you now.

01:50:36.587 --> 01:50:38.046
You're right.

01:50:38.214 --> 01:50:40.465
They are watching over us.

01:50:42.677 --> 01:50:44.803
Yes, they are.

01:50:46.347 --> 01:50:49.516
Yes, they are.

01:50:49.684 --> 01:50:53.019
Have I told you
I love you?

01:50:53.187 --> 01:50:56.690
Every day for 44 years.

01:50:56.858 --> 01:51:00.735
Just wanted to make sure.

01:51:00.903 --> 01:51:03.572
You know I lost
my favorite ball cap?

01:51:03.739 --> 01:51:06.700
Aw, we can get
another one.

01:51:18.754 --> 01:51:20.630
Hey, how you doing?

01:51:20.798 --> 01:51:22.883
You all right?

01:51:23.050 --> 01:51:25.135
Actually, no.

01:51:25.303 --> 01:51:27.095
I'm not.

01:51:27.263 --> 01:51:28.847
Let's have a look.

01:51:31.726 --> 01:51:33.185
What kind of person
would risk his life

01:51:33.352 --> 01:51:37.480
for someone who just
finished ruining him?

01:51:37.648 --> 01:51:40.400
I honestly don't know.

01:51:40.568 --> 01:51:43.987
I think I was wrong,
Thomas.

01:51:44.155 --> 01:51:46.406
And I think you were too.

01:51:46.574 --> 01:51:48.783
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

01:51:48.951 --> 01:51:51.745
Maybe I'm the one
with the God complex.

01:51:54.498 --> 01:51:56.917
Come on, you know what?

01:51:57.084 --> 01:52:00.795
Maybe we should just
get out of here.

01:52:00.963 --> 01:52:04.966
No,we shouldn't.

01:52:17.521 --> 01:52:22.025
(male narrator)
I'm not sure any of us ever
gets to see the whole picture,

01:52:22.193 --> 01:52:25.820
the God's eye view,
so to speak.

01:52:25.988 --> 01:52:29.324
It's like we're little
children,
sitting on the floor,

01:52:29.492 --> 01:52:34.913
gazing up at the back side of
a tapestry that's being woven.

01:52:35.081 --> 01:52:38.917
To our eyes,
it sometimes looks ugly.

01:52:39.085 --> 01:52:44.464
The colors are a jumble
and none of it makes much
sense.

01:52:44.632 --> 01:52:47.050
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:52:47.218 --> 01:52:48.718
- Hey, Joe.
- How's the leg?

01:52:48.886 --> 01:52:51.054
(J.D.)
Eh, gets me out
of raking leaves.

01:52:51.222 --> 01:52:52.806
[laughing]

01:52:52.974 --> 01:52:55.183
(Joe)
I want to thank you
for taking them in.

01:52:55.351 --> 01:52:57.310
(J.D.)
Oh, we're blessed
to have them.

01:52:57.478 --> 01:52:58.937
We're one big family now.

01:52:59.105 --> 01:53:00.730
(Lily)
See, Mommy?

01:53:00.898 --> 01:53:03.525
God really does love us.

01:53:03.693 --> 01:53:06.361
He does, baby.

01:53:06.529 --> 01:53:08.655
He really does.

01:53:11.242 --> 01:53:15.704
(male narrator)
But one day, we'll no longer
be sitting on the floor.

01:53:15.871 --> 01:53:19.666
We'll come around
to the other side,

01:53:19.834 --> 01:53:26.464
and the genius of God's
handiwork will become clear.

01:53:26.632 --> 01:53:31.720
At the center of it all,
we'll see the cross.

I was.

01:53:50.614 --> 01:53:55.618
(male narrating)
But in that immense tapestry,
we'll also see the single

01:53:55.786 --> 01:54:00.749
unique thread, the only one
of its kind and color,

01:54:00.916 --> 01:54:05.045
that our own life
has added to the piece,

01:54:05.212 --> 01:54:09.507
the one thread without
which the whole thing

01:54:09.675 --> 01:54:16.014
would somehow
be incomplete.

01:54:16.182 --> 01:54:19.893

to see his masterpiece.
