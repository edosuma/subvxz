WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.138
Tanaka dirty?
You don't believe that.

00:03.750 --> 00:06.154
Seems he signed out
four ki's of high grade blow.

00:06.220 --> 00:07.622
Only three of them made it back.

00:07.688 --> 00:08.723
Do you buy this?

00:08.788 --> 00:10.858
We could be having
a major crisis here.

00:15.362 --> 00:17.633
You're stonewalling me,
Page, and I don't like it.

00:17.699 --> 00:19.168
What are you hiding?

00:20.134 --> 00:23.407
Why do I suddenly feel like a trout
that's about to have the hook set?

01:39.351 --> 01:40.653
You guys see
Rockford last night?

01:40.718 --> 01:41.820
Naw.

01:41.886 --> 01:43.189
No, man, It was a good one.

01:43.255 --> 01:46.894
Hudson, how can you waste your
time on some detective show

01:46.959 --> 01:50.098
when public television's
covering the Watergate hearings?

01:50.162 --> 01:51.163
I don't know.

01:51.230 --> 01:53.467
Don you know your
country's future's at stake?

01:53.532 --> 01:55.737
Spare us, Pogue.

01:55.801 --> 01:57.801
The only time you watch
anything on public broadcast

01:57.803 --> 02:00.875
is if Lester's Lanai Lounge
had it on the tube,

02:01.140 --> 02:04.347
and then you watch two-thirds of it
through the bottom of a beer mug.

02:04.411 --> 02:07.851
Players inbound from
the north, players inbound.

02:09.616 --> 02:11.119
Rockford was great.

02:11.184 --> 02:14.624
Jim was being driven nuts by this
pain in the butt named Lance White.

02:14.688 --> 02:16.257
This guy's Mr. Perfect, right?

02:16.322 --> 02:18.593
He's finding all the clues,
catching all the suspects.

02:18.659 --> 02:20.362
Sounds like me. Yeah.

02:20.428 --> 02:22.865
At least the pain
in the butt part.

02:23.264 --> 02:24.432
Hey, hey.

02:28.669 --> 02:30.606
You know
what I can't figure out?

02:30.672 --> 02:33.778
Why that man just
didn't burn those tapes?

02:33.841 --> 02:35.276
I'll tell you why. Because he...

02:35.342 --> 02:36.812
Okay, guys, on my mark.

02:36.877 --> 02:37.878
Check.

02:38.580 --> 02:41.385
You ready, partner?
It's showtime.

02:41.450 --> 02:44.522
Go. Police, hold it!

02:50.826 --> 02:52.061
Watch your back!

03:13.116 --> 03:15.387
I've always loved baseball.

03:15.452 --> 03:19.259
I think it has more of the American
character than any other sport.

03:19.323 --> 03:21.627
It's competitive without
being cutthroat.

03:21.692 --> 03:22.995
Basically simple,

03:23.060 --> 03:25.397
but capable of
incredible complexity.

03:31.835 --> 03:33.838
This gives it
thrilling bursts of action

03:33.904 --> 03:36.309
and moments of
leisurely tranquility.

03:36.374 --> 03:39.213
All in all, I'm convinced
that baseball represents

03:39.277 --> 03:41.781
one of man's noblest endeavors.

03:41.845 --> 03:43.515
Are you nuts?

03:44.816 --> 03:46.921
He would've beaten
that throw by 10 feet!

03:46.985 --> 03:51.193
The situation I gave them was score
tied, runner first, one out.

03:51.256 --> 03:53.193
The runner should hold
at third on a double.

03:53.258 --> 03:56.865
But you said it was the eighth
inning and that is the winning run!

03:56.928 --> 03:59.933
Exactly, but we cannot win if the
runner takes a foolish chance

03:59.998 --> 04:01.079
and gets thrown out at home.

04:01.133 --> 04:04.639
But Biff's your best base runner and
your cutoff man was out of position.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.808
Look, a runner at third
can score on a sacrifice fly,

04:06.872 --> 04:08.307
a ground ball to the
right, a wild pitch.

04:08.374 --> 04:10.879
And he can be stranded on a
double play, a strikeout...

04:10.943 --> 04:12.513
A passed ball. An infield fly.

04:12.579 --> 04:16.820
Okay, okay, break it up
or I'll have to run you in.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.351
Great timing, Lieutenant.

04:18.418 --> 04:21.290
Now here is a man who really
knows something about baseball.

04:21.353 --> 04:22.656
Okay, here's the situation.

04:22.722 --> 04:24.025
I'll tell him! I made it up.

04:24.090 --> 04:28.264
Eighth inning, score tied,
runner at first, one out.

04:28.361 --> 04:31.233
The batter hits a double
in the left center field.

04:31.298 --> 04:33.135
Now, should you try
and score the runner

04:33.200 --> 04:34.970
or should you hold him at third?

04:35.035 --> 04:37.005
Are we at home or away?

04:37.070 --> 04:40.510
Play for a tie at home,
a win on the road.

04:43.511 --> 04:45.916
There, that proves it.
Proves what?

04:45.980 --> 04:48.317
You didn't say whether
we were at home or away.

04:48.382 --> 04:52.691
Thomas, all these guys live around here.
Obviously they're at home.

04:52.754 --> 04:54.824
Hey, honcho, you think
I could've scored?

04:54.890 --> 04:59.332
Probably, but you're rounding third
too wide and you didn't touch second.

04:59.761 --> 05:02.666
Yeah. Your nephew's quite a ballplayer.
Fast, too.

05:02.731 --> 05:04.601
Yeah, he's got
his head on straight.

05:04.666 --> 05:06.503
Someday he's gonna
play in the majors.

05:06.568 --> 05:09.307
Okay, okay. Let's
continue this situation.

05:09.371 --> 05:14.248
Okay, remember, one out,
the home team at bat.

05:15.311 --> 05:17.114
Now you get back to
third where you belong.

05:17.180 --> 05:18.882
You know T.Câ™ª s problem?

05:18.947 --> 05:21.018
Football is his game.

05:21.084 --> 05:22.619
Seems pretty
knowledgeable to me.

05:22.685 --> 05:24.723
He knows the book on baseball

05:24.788 --> 05:28.494
but he doesn't have the gut
instincts for it that you and I do.

05:28.559 --> 05:30.596
See, we know the subtleties,

05:30.661 --> 05:33.065
the intangibles,
the heart of the game.

05:33.129 --> 05:34.432
You're right about one thing.

05:34.498 --> 05:37.069
Sometimes the book
doesn't cover the situation.

05:37.134 --> 05:38.603
Still, once you go away from it,

05:38.669 --> 05:41.041
you're on your own,
making all the decisions,

05:41.105 --> 05:42.373
playing it by ear.

05:42.439 --> 05:45.144
It's kind of scary unless you
can get someone to back you up.

05:45.209 --> 05:47.046
I know what
you're gonna do, T.C.

05:47.111 --> 05:49.783
Of course, the only place you
can get that kind of support

05:49.848 --> 05:52.353
is from another gambler.
Somebody like you, maybe?

05:52.417 --> 05:56.825
You're gonna hit it exactly where you
need to, just to prove your point!

05:58.223 --> 05:59.224
I got it.

06:02.795 --> 06:03.863
All right! All right!

06:03.929 --> 06:05.531
Good play. Good play all around.

06:05.597 --> 06:06.800
Way to charge the ball.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.134
Good throw!

06:08.199 --> 06:10.771
Good slide, Biff. Good slide.

06:10.836 --> 06:12.439
Good slide, son.

06:15.141 --> 06:16.776
That's...

06:18.511 --> 06:20.014
Hey, Lieutenant?

06:21.080 --> 06:23.150
I'm sorry, did you want
to ask me something?

06:23.249 --> 06:25.621
Forget it. How about that slide?

06:25.686 --> 06:29.125
I'm telling you, some day he's
gonna play in the majors.

06:31.958 --> 06:34.530
You've got it. All right, all
right, here we go, here we go.

06:34.594 --> 06:36.064
Get your hands off my buns.

06:36.129 --> 06:39.129
I've got to account for every crumb or
Higgins is gonna have me shot at dawn.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.601
Come on, Rick, be creative.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.203
We're hungry,
we're short of funds,

06:42.269 --> 06:44.006
call it
a contribution to charity.

06:44.071 --> 06:45.908
Yeah. Be a little
civic minded like us.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.177
I mean, I donate time
to coach a team,

06:48.241 --> 06:51.715
and Thomas is always willing to
volunteer for a good cause, aren't you?

06:51.779 --> 06:53.014
Abso...

06:53.080 --> 06:56.020
Why do I suddenly feel like a trout
that's about to have the hook set?

06:56.084 --> 06:57.286
Trout? Hey, no trout.

06:57.352 --> 06:58.854
That's tomorrow's
catch of the day.

06:58.921 --> 07:02.360
Don't worry, Rick. Nobody's
going to touch your trout.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.594
Oh, sure, it's all
a big joke to you guys.

07:04.660 --> 07:06.261
I mean, what've you got
to be upset about?

07:06.294 --> 07:08.694
I'm the one that's holding the
fuzzy end of the lollipop here.

07:09.565 --> 07:11.835
You guys can make up all
the silly excuses you want

07:11.900 --> 07:14.538
'cause you're in the clear.
Your job's not on the line.

07:14.603 --> 07:17.575
If things go wrong, I'm the one who's
hanging out there, twisting in the wind,

07:17.639 --> 07:18.842
all by myself.

07:18.908 --> 07:21.512
And I'm the one who has to face
Higgins and the board of directors

07:21.577 --> 07:23.782
and account for every
item that is missing.

07:23.847 --> 07:27.588
So I don't find anything
funny about any of this.

07:28.117 --> 07:29.487
You're forgetting
one thing, Rick.

07:29.552 --> 07:33.192
I can now control Higgins
because I know his secret.

07:33.289 --> 07:36.695
The Robin Masters theory.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.530
It is not a theory, T.C.

07:38.595 --> 07:41.802
it is a scientific fact that
every day grows more certain.

07:41.866 --> 07:44.337
Jonathan Quail Higgins
is Robin Masters.

07:44.401 --> 07:46.104
Yeah, but I've seen
'em both together.

07:46.169 --> 07:48.006
Exactly! Don't you see?

07:48.072 --> 07:50.710
Higgins writes these
Robin Masters' novels

07:50.775 --> 07:53.080
and creates this playboy
image for the writer.

07:53.144 --> 07:54.546
So he goes out and hires someone

07:54.612 --> 07:55.814
to play the role.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.149
One question, Thomas.

07:57.214 --> 07:58.683
Why? Why?

07:58.749 --> 08:00.252
Take a look at
Higgins' background.

08:00.317 --> 08:03.724
It would've been fine if he'd turned
out to be a military historian or

08:03.789 --> 08:06.928
a great literary giant but a
writer of cheap pulp novels?

08:06.992 --> 08:08.395
Guns, girls and gore?

08:08.460 --> 08:09.962
Well, sounds pretty good to me.

08:10.028 --> 08:12.967
Yeah, but see, Higgins can't
stand that swinging lifestyle.

08:13.031 --> 08:14.501
It's too much like his father's.

08:14.566 --> 08:17.505
He wouldn't allow himself to
succeed in that way, so...

08:17.569 --> 08:19.974
He invented Robin Masters.

08:20.039 --> 08:22.159
Geez, and I thought all fairy
tales ended the same way.

08:22.207 --> 08:23.710
They lived happily ever after.

08:23.776 --> 08:25.345
Yuck! Do you buy this?

08:25.410 --> 08:27.448
Hey, if T.M. says
it's so, it's so.

08:27.513 --> 08:29.783
After all he's the'expert
in investigation

08:29.849 --> 08:33.022
and that's not all you should see
h'ow much he knows about baseball.

08:33.086 --> 08:34.254
Hey, open the door, pal.

08:34.320 --> 08:35.388
Sure.

08:35.455 --> 08:38.995
Hey, Thomas, how can Higgins
invent another person?

08:39.225 --> 08:41.697
Well, it's not that difficult
if you know what you're doing.

08:41.761 --> 08:43.732
You get hold of a couple
of pieces of key ID

08:43.797 --> 08:47.437
and then you just start to use the
new identity to live the new life.

08:47.501 --> 08:49.838
Before long, everyone accepts
you as Robin Masters

08:49.903 --> 08:51.139
instead of John Doe.

08:51.205 --> 08:54.711
I mean, it's really not that difficult
if you've got a vivid imagination.

08:54.775 --> 08:57.915
Anyone who can invent
six bestselling novels

08:57.979 --> 09:01.085
could easily invent
one bestselling novelist.

09:02.016 --> 09:04.688
I'm telling you, I saw Higgins
watching from the study window.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.221
Actually,
inventing another person

09:06.286 --> 09:08.257
isn't such a bad idea
when you think about it.

09:08.323 --> 09:09.425
Higgins? Magnum.

09:09.491 --> 09:11.595
Higgins! You were saying?

09:12.161 --> 09:14.164
I don't wanna coach
third base on Saturday.

09:14.229 --> 09:15.832
What are you doing here?
What have you got there?

09:15.898 --> 09:17.835
What are you looking for?
How do you turn this thing on?

09:17.900 --> 09:19.302
What are you hiding?
Button on the left.

09:19.367 --> 09:21.739
I asked you first. My Chinese
puzzle box is missing.

09:21.804 --> 09:24.008
I recall your asking
about borrowing it.

09:24.073 --> 09:25.643
Right. I wanted to
show it to some friends.

09:25.708 --> 09:28.613
Yeah. And to bet them 10 bucks a
pop that they couldn't open it.

09:44.361 --> 09:46.298
What is that?

09:46.363 --> 09:48.400
Yeah, what is that?

09:49.733 --> 09:52.271
A thing of
rare beauty and value.

09:52.335 --> 09:53.938
Men have
patiently cultivated it,

09:54.005 --> 09:56.910
decade after decade,
century after century,

09:57.307 --> 10:00.246
for no other reason than the
pleasure it gives them.

10:00.310 --> 10:03.249
Those not under its spell
may think it frivolous,

10:03.313 --> 10:07.922
but for those who know its charms it
is a wanton and demanding mistress.

10:07.985 --> 10:10.523
Well, it looks
like a bag of mud to me.

10:10.588 --> 10:13.026
And within that mud
is my own creation,

10:13.091 --> 10:14.994
the Lady Ashley Tea.

10:15.060 --> 10:19.334
Tea? You violated my
privacy looking for tea?

10:19.397 --> 10:21.367
Tea roses, Magnum.

10:21.432 --> 10:23.570
The hybrid root clusters
contained in this soil

10:23.635 --> 10:28.211
should merit another first prize at
next year's Queen Emma Garden Festival.

10:30.275 --> 10:31.410
You're really
not going to coach?

10:31.476 --> 10:32.678
I'm busy Saturday.

10:32.744 --> 10:36.986
Hey, Higgie baby, with all
of your clubs and foundations,

10:37.050 --> 10:40.690
you probably don't have much
time for anything else, do you?

10:41.888 --> 10:43.190
Such as?

10:43.288 --> 10:44.658
I don't know.

10:44.824 --> 10:50.202
Say you maybe wanted to paint a
picture or write a novel or two.

10:50.264 --> 10:54.906
Well, your preposterous theory
seems to have found an audience.

10:54.969 --> 10:57.173
It's not preposterous
and you know it.

10:57.237 --> 10:58.974
Oh, really.

10:59.640 --> 11:02.445
It may interest you to know that when
I mentioned your idea to Mr. Masters,

11:02.509 --> 11:04.044
he said... You told him?

11:04.111 --> 11:05.481
Indeed.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.383
What'd he say?

11:08.449 --> 11:10.786
He said he very much wants to
discuss the matter with you

11:10.851 --> 11:13.189
during his next visit in person.

11:16.758 --> 11:20.499
Oh, Rick, I've decided not to have
you arrested for petty theft.

11:20.562 --> 11:23.166
I'll just deduct the cost of these
party materials from your salary

11:23.231 --> 11:25.869
and assess a
moderate punitive fine.

11:27.636 --> 11:29.139
I knew it! I knew it!

11:29.205 --> 11:30.674
I can't believe he told Robin.

11:30.739 --> 11:32.342
So what?

11:32.607 --> 11:34.778
He's just another John
Doe imposter, right?

11:34.844 --> 11:36.847
Oh, I can see you're
enjoying yourself, T.C.,

11:36.912 --> 11:39.851
but we could be having
a major crisis here.

11:39.915 --> 11:42.620
I mean, no matter how carefully
you figure things out,

11:42.685 --> 11:44.388
there's always the chance
you missed something,

11:44.453 --> 11:47.058
some little detail
that you just overlooked.

11:47.124 --> 11:48.326
Yeah?

11:49.592 --> 11:53.032
Okay, I'm 990/o sure that Higgins
is really Robin Masters,

11:53.096 --> 11:57.505
but there is that other 10/o that nobody
could really be held accountable for.

11:57.567 --> 11:59.737
Anybody could overlook
some obscure point.

11:59.803 --> 12:02.975
Could miscalculate
somewhere along the line.

12:03.040 --> 12:06.514
But it's that 10/o that
could mean disaster.

12:24.629 --> 12:27.167
Now, this is modern coaching.

12:27.232 --> 12:29.971
Instead of sneaking around
trying to scout the opposition,

12:30.035 --> 12:33.742
I sent Orville to sneak around
and videotape the opposition.

12:33.806 --> 12:36.210
Uh-huh, are you ready now?

12:42.414 --> 12:45.620
I had a little problem
with the focus ring.

12:51.725 --> 12:54.463
That's a great shot,
but where's the game?

12:54.526 --> 12:55.595
It's right there.

12:55.662 --> 12:57.766
The guy just hit a base hit.
He's going to first.

12:57.831 --> 12:59.834
Looks more like something
crawling up the screen,

12:59.899 --> 13:01.669
a gnat in a baseball cap.

13:01.735 --> 13:04.740
Are you telling me that
that's as close as you got?

13:04.804 --> 13:06.240
T.C., forget it.
You don't need it anyway.

13:06.307 --> 13:09.012
All you need for Saturday's game...
Is a third base coach.

13:09.076 --> 13:12.482
Especially one that knows everything
there is to know about baseball.

13:12.545 --> 13:15.083
Okay, okay, I'll do it.

13:16.016 --> 13:17.051
Hello?

13:17.384 --> 13:19.722
Magnum, Lieutenant Page.

13:19.787 --> 13:21.657
Yeah, Page, what's up?

13:30.232 --> 13:34.039
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

13:34.104 --> 13:37.743
He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures.

13:37.807 --> 13:40.345
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

13:40.731 --> 13:42.701
He restoreth my soul.

13:42.980 --> 13:47.188
He leadeth me in the path of
righteousness for His names' sake.

13:47.250 --> 13:50.757
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

13:50.821 --> 13:52.524
I will fear no evil.

13:52.590 --> 13:54.593
For thou art with me.

13:54.658 --> 13:57.797
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

13:58.596 --> 14:02.470
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

14:02.533 --> 14:05.205
Thou annointest
my head with oil.

14:05.871 --> 14:07.774
My cup runneth over.

14:07.839 --> 14:13.183
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life.

14:13.745 --> 14:17.419
And I will dwell in the
house of the Lord forever.

14:23.089 --> 14:27.063
Thank you. Thank you.

14:31.397 --> 14:32.632
T.C.

14:32.698 --> 14:34.368
Thanks for coming, Coach.

14:35.301 --> 14:36.971
Listen, Biff, you take
all the time you want...

14:37.037 --> 14:38.406
I'd rather play.

14:39.505 --> 14:41.242
I'll be at practice tomorrow.

14:55.155 --> 14:58.194
From the day
Yoshi joined the force,

14:58.258 --> 15:00.495
I thought about
what might happen.

15:00.561 --> 15:04.736
But it was always someone with
a gun in some dark alley.

15:05.066 --> 15:08.005
I never considered
anything like this.

15:10.672 --> 15:12.208
Car wreck?

15:14.809 --> 15:17.614
It's just a simple car wreck.

15:21.216 --> 15:23.420
If there's anything
you need, Barbara,

15:23.486 --> 15:27.059
any help with your brother's
affairs, just don't hesitate.

15:27.122 --> 15:28.358
I won't.

15:30.926 --> 15:33.131
You take care of your mom, okay?

15:49.713 --> 15:51.049
Let's go.

15:54.417 --> 15:56.053
We had a deal, Page.

15:56.120 --> 15:59.794
I promised not to tell what I know and
you promised to keep me informed.

16:00.758 --> 16:01.993
So what's changed?

16:02.059 --> 16:03.562
It's been five days.

16:04.128 --> 16:06.600
All you've managed to do so
far is lie to Tanaka's family

16:06.664 --> 16:08.534
and plant a phony story
in the newspaper.

16:08.599 --> 16:11.104
I remember telling you
that we had a better shot

16:11.169 --> 16:13.039
if the killer thinks that
he can get away with it.

16:13.105 --> 16:14.774
Oh, come on, Page.

16:14.840 --> 16:17.611
Anybody over 12 knows
that burning a body

16:17.676 --> 16:20.748
can't cover up gunshot wounds
for more than a couple of days.

16:20.812 --> 16:24.386
We'll release the true circumstances
when we feel the time is right.

16:24.449 --> 16:27.221
You buried a fellow officer
today as an accident victim

16:27.286 --> 16:28.806
when he was killed
in the line of duty,

16:28.820 --> 16:30.323
and the reasons you're
giving me don't make sense.

16:30.389 --> 16:34.396
Now you're stonewalling me,
Page, and I don't like it!

16:34.459 --> 16:37.231
And what's more,
I don't understand why!

16:37.296 --> 16:38.666
Lieutenant, Detective Clifton

16:38.731 --> 16:40.768
needs to talk to
you about something.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.637
Andrew Clifton?

16:42.702 --> 16:44.539
What are you two cooking up?

16:44.604 --> 16:46.240
Nothing.

16:47.907 --> 16:50.178
So that's what
this is all about.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.982
Internal Affairs is
investigating Tanaka.

16:53.047 --> 16:54.082
Oh, no.

16:54.148 --> 16:56.519
This is between you two.
I'm out of it.

16:58.085 --> 17:01.992
I had a couple of uniforms who were helping
themselves to some stereo equipment...

17:02.056 --> 17:04.261
Save your breath, Lieutenant.
Just tell me why.

17:04.325 --> 17:06.829
Read my lips. It's another case.

17:09.164 --> 17:13.405
Look, at best, Tanaka was out there
playing cowboy with no backup.

17:13.467 --> 17:14.468
But just maybe...

17:14.535 --> 17:18.209
Tanaka dirty?
You don't believe that.

17:20.307 --> 17:23.414
Okay, if you don't want
to talk to me, fine.

17:24.546 --> 17:26.348
I don't like this any
better than you do, Magnum,

17:26.414 --> 17:27.883
but I got my orders.

17:27.949 --> 17:30.521
So from here on out, just
stay the hell out of it!

17:30.585 --> 17:31.687
Our deal is off.

17:31.753 --> 17:33.757
Over. Cancelled.

17:33.823 --> 17:35.760
What's the matter, Magnum?

17:35.825 --> 17:39.064
Having trouble getting special
favors from the department now?

17:40.596 --> 17:46.407
I missed you at Tanaka's funeral, Clifton.
I guess you were too busy.

18:00.017 --> 18:03.089
I had a strange feeling
about the car accident.

18:04.021 --> 18:08.864
Well, the police have been keeping
it quiet while they investigate,

18:08.925 --> 18:11.096
but I just felt
that you and Biff

18:11.162 --> 18:13.299
should know that
he died in the line of duty.

18:14.198 --> 18:15.968
Thank you, Thomas.

18:16.901 --> 18:20.642
Yoshi always took pride
in being a good policeman.

18:22.473 --> 18:24.042
How's Biff doing?

18:25.110 --> 18:26.111
Come with me.

18:36.855 --> 18:38.357
He built that for Biff.

18:39.692 --> 18:41.495
He knows his uncle is gone

18:41.560 --> 18:45.534
but he won't let himself
feel the loss yet.

18:46.532 --> 18:48.869
He thinks he is
being a man about it.

18:49.936 --> 18:52.875
He's been buried
himself in baseball.

18:54.406 --> 18:58.080
The big game.
It's all he talks about.

19:00.146 --> 19:02.484
I think he just
needs a little time.

19:03.416 --> 19:06.155
I suppose we all do.

19:12.093 --> 19:16.267
I keep telling myself I have to
sort through his things, but...

19:16.797 --> 19:22.508
I promised a Detective Clifton I
would look for Yoshi's bank account.

19:22.570 --> 19:25.108
I guess
he's investigating the case.

19:27.042 --> 19:31.718
Yoshi and Rob when they were
promoted to detectives.

19:31.780 --> 19:32.848
Rob?

19:32.914 --> 19:36.788
Rob Slater. Yoshi's
partner for eight years.

19:36.852 --> 19:38.020
More than a partner,

19:38.086 --> 19:41.025
a best friend, a brother almost.

19:42.824 --> 19:48.202
It's ironic they were both
killed in the line of duty.

19:50.465 --> 19:52.636
I thought Yoshi would
never get over it.

19:52.702 --> 19:54.839
Well, when you lose
a friend in their prime,

19:54.904 --> 19:56.407
you don't forget.

19:57.039 --> 20:01.046
Especially when they die
saving your life.

20:03.045 --> 20:07.587
What am I going to do about
the disposing of the crypt?

20:08.852 --> 20:10.354
Crypt?

20:10.420 --> 20:14.227
For some reason,
Yoshi bought one.

20:14.291 --> 20:18.533
I found receipts for payments
among his things.

20:19.062 --> 20:22.969
But his will indicated he wants
to be buried with the family.

20:25.736 --> 20:28.074
I don't understand
why he did it.

20:40.452 --> 20:43.491
Sometimes you have
to make a leap of faith.

20:43.555 --> 20:46.761
Often that leap takes you
over a very steep cliff

20:46.826 --> 20:48.963
with a very rocky bottom.

20:49.028 --> 20:52.367
However, in this case, my
decision to leap was made easier

20:52.431 --> 20:58.710
by the fact that this was the only disorderly
element in Tanaka's well-ordered life.

23:09.041 --> 23:13.283
For some reason, my Aunt Sophie's
parlor kept flashing in my mind.

23:13.746 --> 23:17.787
The one that was neat and clean
and smelled like a pine cleaner.

23:17.850 --> 23:21.557
The one she only let you go
into on very special occasions.

23:21.922 --> 23:25.896
At first I thought she didn't want anyone
scuffing up the polish on the floor.

23:25.959 --> 23:28.196
But then, I realized.

23:28.261 --> 23:30.532
It wasn't Aunt Sophie's
parlor at all.

23:30.598 --> 23:32.802
It was her shrine to Uncle Drew.

23:32.866 --> 23:36.640
Her only living link with
the man she loved and lost.

23:37.004 --> 23:38.474
Kind of like what a man might do

23:38.539 --> 23:41.311
for a partner
who died saving his life.

23:41.376 --> 23:43.914
Especially if he wanted
to leave a message behind,

23:43.978 --> 23:46.115
in case anything
happened to him.

23:46.180 --> 23:49.420
I could never
forget this man's face.

23:49.485 --> 23:55.230
His name is Grady Walker and he
is the one who shot Rob Slater.

23:56.824 --> 23:58.294
So, he's in prison?

23:58.360 --> 24:02.167
No. That's one of the things
that tore Yoshi apart.

24:02.297 --> 24:05.069
Grady Walker
never came to trial.

24:05.167 --> 24:09.910
He supposedly had complete mental
breakdown and was sent to an asylum.

24:12.342 --> 24:14.044
What is it with you guys?

24:14.109 --> 24:16.747
You descend on a place
like the locusts.

24:16.812 --> 24:18.782
I'm not sure I follow you.

24:18.847 --> 24:21.820
You said that you were from the State
Attorney General's office, right?

24:21.885 --> 24:24.022
Yes, the Criminal
Compliance Division.

24:24.087 --> 24:26.291
We keep tabs on
the criminally insane.

24:26.356 --> 24:29.128
Well Bres'low was just here.

24:30.226 --> 24:34.435
Robert Breslow, the
Assistant Attorney General,

24:34.498 --> 24:35.833
your boss.

24:35.899 --> 24:36.934
Yeah.

24:37.001 --> 24:41.042
He didn't even know that he was
inspecting the facility today.

24:41.105 --> 24:42.675
Well, if we knew
what was going on,

24:42.741 --> 24:44.510
we wouldn't be the
government, would we?

24:44.575 --> 24:46.145
Who are you checking on?

24:46.210 --> 24:47.278
What?

24:47.344 --> 24:50.617
Who are you checking on?

24:52.183 --> 24:54.254
Walker. Grady Walker.

25:02.327 --> 25:03.863
He's here, all right.

25:03.929 --> 25:07.536
Walker, Grady H. 58. Caucasian.

25:07.600 --> 25:11.207
Transferred here from Hilo
State Hospital, June, '78,

25:12.405 --> 25:14.408
Will there be anything else?

25:14.474 --> 25:17.046
No, I think
that's all I need here.

25:17.110 --> 25:18.913
We can go whenever you're ready.

25:18.978 --> 25:20.480
You have to see him, too?

25:20.546 --> 25:21.614
Afraid so.

25:21.682 --> 25:25.823
Can't we skip it? I really don't
have time to play tour guide.

25:25.885 --> 25:27.989
I understand and I
know how busy you are

25:28.054 --> 25:30.158
but if I could just see him now,

25:30.223 --> 25:32.060
you wouldn't have to
drop everything later

25:32.125 --> 25:34.230
when I come back
with a court order.

25:42.436 --> 25:44.741
There he is.

25:53.648 --> 25:55.318
Grady Walker.

26:04.125 --> 26:06.162
Thank you very much, Doctor.

26:07.814 --> 26:10.085
So, you're a friend
of Andrew Clifton's?

26:10.150 --> 26:11.953
Isn't often
Internal Affairs calls us

26:12.019 --> 26:15.191
and tells us to give
free access to a civilian.

26:15.255 --> 26:18.260
Well, I'm happy to be
one of the favored few.

26:19.193 --> 26:20.829
Well, to tell you the truth,

26:20.894 --> 26:24.134
I thought it was a scam until
Lieutenant Page verified it.

26:24.199 --> 26:27.672
Page? Yeah, nice guy,
but a bad dresser.

26:27.734 --> 26:30.339
He said you're a writer?
Television?

26:30.405 --> 26:32.442
Oh, I used to be but
I found it too demeaning.

26:32.507 --> 26:33.877
I just do features now.

26:33.942 --> 26:35.144
Movies.

26:35.210 --> 26:36.513
No kidding.

26:37.612 --> 26:40.384
Yeah, I'm interested in
a case dating back to 1973.

26:40.449 --> 26:42.820
It was a drug bust
that turned into a shooting

26:42.951 --> 26:44.854
and a policeman was killed.

26:44.919 --> 26:46.756
1973, huh?

26:46.821 --> 26:47.857
Yeah.

26:47.923 --> 26:52.364
Well, if we have it,
it's probably over here.

26:52.428 --> 26:54.131
Here we go.

26:57.700 --> 26:59.035
Boy,

26:59.702 --> 27:02.407
this is so embarrassing,
especially for a writer.

27:02.472 --> 27:05.845
I was gonna take some notes, but I
don't have anything to write with.

27:06.977 --> 27:12.387
Oh, well, that's no problem. I'll
get you a pad and pen from my desk.

27:47.185 --> 27:48.420
Higgins!

27:50.956 --> 27:52.358
Magnum,

27:52.424 --> 27:55.163
you really are a man
born out of your time.

27:55.227 --> 27:57.432
You would've made such
an effective town crier.

27:57.497 --> 27:59.099
Did you put a new
lock on the darkroom?

27:59.165 --> 28:00.534
No, a locksmith did.

28:00.600 --> 28:03.405
Mr. Masters recently forwarded
a new Zeitlin 9000 camera

28:03.469 --> 28:06.007
with crystal locked
strobe capabilities.

28:06.072 --> 28:09.378
I didn't want it to escape before
he had a chance to try it out.

28:09.442 --> 28:11.078
Well, how did you like it?

28:13.313 --> 28:15.985
Okay, call it even. Look, I
need to get in the darkroom.

28:16.049 --> 28:17.184
For?

28:17.251 --> 28:20.423
I need to enlarge this picture,
see if it's been altered.

28:20.487 --> 28:21.522
May I?

28:23.023 --> 28:25.360
I did a brief stint with
Ml5 at the end of the war.

28:25.426 --> 28:27.263
TDY, of course.

28:27.328 --> 28:28.530
There were
a remarkable number of

28:28.595 --> 28:30.365
phony documents floating around.

28:30.431 --> 28:33.671
Passports, visas,
birth certificates.

28:33.734 --> 28:37.308
I recall our apprehending a German
general who was trying to leave Europe

28:37.372 --> 28:40.211
disguised as an
Albanian countess.

28:40.275 --> 28:43.748
He got caught because he was too
attractive to be an Albanian Countess.

28:45.447 --> 28:47.785
Yes, it's a very nice job.

28:47.849 --> 28:50.554
What we used to call
"Fine line lamination'."

28:50.619 --> 28:51.954
You mean it's a phony?

28:52.020 --> 28:53.656
Quite. The old picture
has been shaved

28:53.722 --> 28:55.091
and the new one
laminated over it.

28:55.156 --> 28:58.162
I knew it. The real Grady Walker's
out on the streets somewhere.

28:58.227 --> 28:59.696
How nice for him.

28:59.761 --> 29:02.833
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some
very delicate surgery to perform

29:02.898 --> 29:04.567
on my Silver Tanaka.

29:07.303 --> 29:08.973
Oh, that's very
nice of you, Higgins.

29:09.038 --> 29:12.010
I've decided the Lady Ashley
Tea can wait one more year.

29:12.742 --> 29:14.846
Well, thanks, for your help.

29:14.910 --> 29:19.319
You may express your gratitude by not
slamming the door on your way out.

29:29.527 --> 29:31.464
Not you again.

29:31.529 --> 29:33.532
You better have your
lab guys check that.

29:33.598 --> 29:34.766
Where'd you get this?

29:34.831 --> 29:37.336
The picture's been altered
by fine line lamination.

29:37.402 --> 29:38.670
And how do we know?

29:38.735 --> 29:41.273
He's much too attractive
to be an Albanian countess.

29:41.339 --> 29:43.342
What? Oh, forget it.

29:43.875 --> 29:45.477
You know, this is
classified information.

29:45.543 --> 29:47.546
You weren't supposed to take it.

29:47.613 --> 29:49.449
Keep it down, remember,
you're my accomplice.

29:49.515 --> 29:51.585
That picture is bogus.

29:51.650 --> 29:53.754
Looks like a plain
old mug shot to me.

29:53.818 --> 29:55.488
I'm telling you,
it's not Grady Walker.

29:55.554 --> 29:57.591
Come on, you gonna
sing that song again?

29:57.656 --> 29:58.924
Read my lips.

29:58.991 --> 30:01.963
Sometime when the real Grady was
transferred from one hospital to another,

30:02.027 --> 30:05.968
he got someone else to take his place
in the flesh and in the record.

30:06.031 --> 30:07.266
And we can prove that?

30:07.332 --> 30:09.570
Just give it to your lab guys,
they'll tell you.

30:09.636 --> 30:10.838
Oh, swell.

30:10.903 --> 30:12.740
I need to talk to you, Page.

30:12.805 --> 30:14.073
Excuse us, Magnum.

30:14.139 --> 30:15.775
That's all right, let him stay.

30:15.841 --> 30:18.613
This happens to concern
his main man, Tanaka.

30:18.678 --> 30:21.450
Seems he signed out
four ki's of high grade blow.

30:21.514 --> 30:23.484
Only three of them made it back.

30:27.987 --> 30:29.623
Page has the other one.

30:30.558 --> 30:31.826
You don't remember, do you?

30:31.891 --> 30:34.161
Well it wa! S pretty crazy
around here that night.

30:34.228 --> 30:37.334
I just happened to be here when
Tanaka fielded that emergency call.

30:37.398 --> 30:39.034
He brought the stuff to you.

30:39.100 --> 30:41.504
And I must've put it...

30:42.870 --> 30:44.072
Left it...

30:44.138 --> 30:46.810
You locked it in your desk.
Yeah. That's right.

30:46.874 --> 30:49.412
You locked it in your desk.
That was the night the...

30:49.478 --> 30:51.715
The two hookers
got in the cat fight...

30:51.780 --> 30:57.158
Yeah, and over the john... No, no, over
the pimp and they wrecked the joint.

30:57.219 --> 30:59.356
Yeah, tore it apart.

31:00.422 --> 31:01.457
Now, wait a minute.

31:01.523 --> 31:04.528
You're trying to tell me you kept
a kilo of drugs in your desk

31:04.593 --> 31:06.531
for two weeks without noticing?

31:06.596 --> 31:08.833
Forget it, Page,
I'm not buying that.

31:09.532 --> 31:11.502
Well, the property
numbers check.

31:11.567 --> 31:16.510
So you can buy it, rent it, or shove
it in your fat investigation folder.

31:20.710 --> 31:22.146
And one other thing.

31:22.211 --> 31:24.548
The guy gave 26 years
to this department

31:24.615 --> 31:27.086
and you ain't spitting
on his grave while I'm here.

31:30.354 --> 31:31.856
Cat fight, huh?

31:34.957 --> 31:36.226
I'd better be going.

31:36.893 --> 31:39.598
I'll let you know what
they say over at the lab.

31:39.663 --> 31:41.633
Oh, and one more thing, dude.

31:41.698 --> 31:44.704
Stay the hell out of my desk.

31:45.903 --> 31:47.171
Way to go.

31:47.237 --> 31:50.076
Good catch, good hustle.
All right, look alive.

31:50.140 --> 31:52.010
Let's get it together,
babe, come on.

31:54.546 --> 31:56.249
I got it! How do they look?

31:56.948 --> 32:00.521
Like a well coached team,
what else?

32:00.585 --> 32:02.488
Here, Danny, hit a few.

32:02.554 --> 32:03.924
Sure, Coach.

32:05.089 --> 32:07.293
Look, I'm sorry I haven't
been more help lately.

32:07.358 --> 32:09.329
I've been kind of busy.

32:09.395 --> 32:12.768
Yeah, I understand.
Kids really miss you, though.

32:13.499 --> 32:14.801
The interference,

32:14.867 --> 32:16.737
the bizarre strategy,

32:16.802 --> 32:18.272
the arguments.

32:18.337 --> 32:20.574
Well, I'm sure they're
enjoying your managing style.

32:20.639 --> 32:22.342
Dull baseball made boring.

32:24.678 --> 32:26.247
How's Biff doing?

32:26.312 --> 32:27.548
Trying too hard.

32:27.614 --> 32:30.353
Making every play as though
his life depended on it.

32:30.417 --> 32:32.354
And I guess
in a way it really does.

32:33.320 --> 32:34.522
J Well

32:35.989 --> 32:38.828
I was just passing by. I've
got some things I got to do.

32:38.893 --> 32:40.428
What about Saturday?

32:40.493 --> 32:42.430
Oh, I'll be there.

32:42.495 --> 32:46.770
Tell your outfielders to step into the
catch when they got to make a long throw.

32:46.834 --> 32:48.236
It gets the momentum going.

32:50.036 --> 32:51.439
Oh, hey, Thomas.

32:52.106 --> 32:55.679
If there's anything that I can do
to help you catch Tanaka's killer,

32:55.743 --> 32:57.179
anything at all.

33:01.349 --> 33:03.252
I can read you like a book.

33:06.187 --> 33:09.494
Keep watching the sky.
I may send up a flare.

35:10.518 --> 35:13.123
Boats are no different
from a house or a car.

35:13.187 --> 35:14.990
I got to have a warrant.

35:15.057 --> 35:16.827
But that could take all night.

35:16.892 --> 35:18.461
True, but I can't help it.

35:18.526 --> 35:20.898
Look, a certain working
girl of my acquaintance

35:20.963 --> 35:23.902
said there was a lot of talk
tonight about one big score

35:23.966 --> 35:26.036
and then a permanent
relocation to the mainland.

35:26.100 --> 35:29.106
I'll try, but hey, I don't
want you near that boat.

35:29.171 --> 35:31.108
I'm just gonna keep an eye out.

35:31.875 --> 35:32.876
Uh-oh.

35:32.942 --> 35:34.277
What's the matter?

35:35.310 --> 35:36.578
I think they're shipping out.

35:36.646 --> 35:38.015
Wait a minute. I can't.

35:38.081 --> 35:39.349
They may not be coming back.

35:39.415 --> 35:40.584
Magnum...

36:50.875 --> 36:54.582
A wise philosopher once said,
"Look before you leap."

36:54.646 --> 36:59.822
However, an equally wise philosopher
once said, "He who hesitates is lost."

37:00.685 --> 37:04.392
if I looked before I leaped
and Grady came back to shore,

37:04.456 --> 37:06.661
everything would work out fine.

37:06.726 --> 37:10.934
But if I hesitated and he
sailed off into the sunrise...

38:44.361 --> 38:45.664
Max.

39:00.111 --> 39:02.482
Have a pleasant voyage. Next
time you're in these waters...

39:02.546 --> 39:03.547
I won't be.

39:03.615 --> 39:05.652
I'm dropping Hawaii
from my route.

40:04.612 --> 40:05.914
Hi, guys.

40:08.817 --> 40:11.656
Now, hold real still.
I'm not used to this thing.

40:12.087 --> 40:14.291
What are you, a cop?

40:15.657 --> 40:18.797
No, Grady, I'm a friend of one.

41:07.445 --> 41:08.880
Walker!

41:40.312 --> 41:44.754
I told you,
I was a friend of a cop.

42:01.669 --> 42:03.238
Nice night for a walk.

42:05.473 --> 42:08.010
What happened to,
"I gotta have a warrant"?

42:08.076 --> 42:09.445
What do you mean?

42:09.510 --> 42:11.714
Well, somebody had
to call in the troops.

42:11.779 --> 42:13.716
Oh, you mean the anonymous tip.

42:13.782 --> 42:16.921
Well anon! Ymous tip doesn't
work in court very well.

42:16.985 --> 42:19.122
But we don't have to worry
about that now, do we?

42:19.186 --> 42:21.424
Only if they bring it
up at Hightower's trial.

42:21.490 --> 42:22.558
Who?

42:22.624 --> 42:25.229
Dr. Hightower,
out at the hospital.

42:25.293 --> 42:27.263
Grady couldn't have
done it without him.

42:27.329 --> 42:29.199
I can show you where he lives.

42:29.264 --> 42:30.900
I got to have a warrant.

42:38.306 --> 42:40.711
All right, all you
have to do is hustle

42:40.776 --> 42:42.846
and play your best and
you can beat these guys.

42:42.912 --> 42:43.947
Sorry.

42:44.013 --> 42:45.048
About time.

42:45.114 --> 42:46.217
What'd I miss?

42:46.282 --> 42:47.951
Just the coach's pep talk.

42:48.018 --> 42:50.288
Oh, rats! Did anybody tape it?

42:53.623 --> 42:56.295
Have you seen Biff?
He hasn't shown yet.

42:56.359 --> 42:57.628
Thomas!

43:00.564 --> 43:03.603
Well, the dam finally burst.

43:03.667 --> 43:07.474
I think knowing the whole truth and
having it all settled helped a lot.

43:07.538 --> 43:08.740
Hey, here comes Biff!

43:08.805 --> 43:10.008
All right!

43:10.074 --> 43:11.142
Sorry we're late.

43:11.209 --> 43:12.979
We stopped by the cemetery.

43:13.510 --> 43:15.580
Biff had to change in the car.

43:17.447 --> 43:20.387
Biff, they'll be plenty other games
if you don't feel like playing.

43:20.451 --> 43:23.155
Absolutely. And the
guys would understand.

43:24.189 --> 43:25.824
Thanks, Coach.

43:25.890 --> 43:27.893
But Mom and I talked it over.

43:27.960 --> 43:30.064
Uncle Yoshi
would want me to play.

43:33.464 --> 43:34.767
Come on, let's go join the team.

43:34.833 --> 43:36.368
Will be right there, Coach.

43:38.904 --> 43:42.478
Mr. Magnum, we just wanted
to thank you for what you did.

43:43.976 --> 43:45.479
We'd like you to have this.

43:50.150 --> 43:52.287
It belonged to Uncle Yoshi.

43:58.959 --> 44:00.362
Thanks, Biff.

44:03.396 --> 44:05.466
He always knew class
when he saw it.

44:08.535 --> 44:10.138
You sure about today?

44:10.704 --> 44:13.710
No, but I wanna try.

44:23.317 --> 44:24.686
All right.

44:27.822 --> 44:30.093
All right, okay.

44:30.158 --> 44:32.262
Nice shot, Biff, nice hit.

44:32.326 --> 44:35.131
Nice shot. Okay, now,
take it easy.

44:35.197 --> 44:37.769
Only one out.
You're the tie breaker.

44:37.833 --> 44:40.405
Ninth inning.
Get a good lead, Biff.

44:40.469 --> 44:42.639
Biff, be careful.

44:42.704 --> 44:44.808
Be aggressive, Biff!

44:46.976 --> 44:49.613
Wait for your pitch, Danny
babe, wait for your pitch.

44:49.678 --> 44:51.682
Be aggressive, Biff!

44:52.115 --> 44:53.417
Be careful, Biff.

45:00.456 --> 45:01.524
Come on, Biff!

45:04.861 --> 45:06.397
Okay, hold him at third, Magnum.

45:06.462 --> 45:07.664
Go! Go!

45:07.730 --> 45:10.635
I'm ordering you,
hold him at third!

45:53.946 --> 45:57.218
Someday, he'll
be playing in the majors.
