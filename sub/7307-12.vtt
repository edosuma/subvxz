WEBVTT

01:24.800 --> 01:26.508
Hey, how was your date last night?

01:26.594 --> 01:28.071
How did you know I had
a date last night?

01:28.095 --> 01:29.816
You talk very loud
when you're on the phone.

01:29.889 --> 01:32.676
- I've been meaning to say something.
- You mean, you eavesdropped?

01:33.643 --> 01:36.347
- Guess it didn't go too well?
- He had to cancel.

01:36.437 --> 01:38.893
- What excuse did he give?
- Surgery.

01:38.981 --> 01:41.472
That's a good one.
I've got to remember that.

01:41.609 --> 01:42.807
What was wrong with him?

01:42.902 --> 01:45.227
He didn't have surgery, Tony,
he performed it.

01:47.156 --> 01:49.528
Hey, how was your big date last night?

01:52.328 --> 01:54.071
- What'd I say?
- Date never happened.

01:55.581 --> 01:58.368
- What excuse did he give?
- Surgery.

01:59.877 --> 02:01.040
It's a good one.

02:01.462 --> 02:02.707
Grab your stuff.

02:03.047 --> 02:05.123
- Where are we going?
- West Virginia.

02:05.466 --> 02:09.298
"Almost heaven.
Take me home, country road."

02:09.387 --> 02:11.759
Old John Denver song.
I'm gonna grab my gear.

02:13.599 --> 02:16.055
- Clarksburg.
- What's in Clarksburg?

02:16.852 --> 02:19.522
Junk dealer. Stumbled onto a leg.

02:19.605 --> 02:22.392
We're driving to West Virginia
to look at a leg?

02:22.483 --> 02:25.686
- It belongs to a marine.
- How can you tell from a leg?

02:35.496 --> 02:38.699
- Gibbs. NCIS.
- How do?

02:38.791 --> 02:41.364
- This is how you found the leg?
- Yes, sir.

02:41.794 --> 02:43.585
Mr Green found it in that dumpster.

02:43.671 --> 02:46.588
When he realised what he was holding,
he tossed it to get rid of it.

02:46.674 --> 02:49.877
Landed here. Kind of funny, ain't it?

02:49.969 --> 02:51.593
- What?
- How it landed.

02:51.971 --> 02:53.880
Like it was climbing the stair.

02:54.473 --> 02:57.558
You think finding the severed leg
of a marine is funny?

02:58.185 --> 03:00.427
No, sir. No, sir, I don't.

03:00.521 --> 03:03.273
- Find the rest of the body?
- Not yet.

03:03.357 --> 03:06.275
Local chief of police has
his boys checking all the dumpsters

03:06.444 --> 03:08.068
and the town garbage pit.

03:09.613 --> 03:10.894
Well, I'll leave you all to it.

03:10.990 --> 03:12.449
- Tony, laser and sketch.
- Got it.

03:12.533 --> 03:14.027
- Kate, take photos.
- Yeah.

03:14.326 --> 03:16.449
What have we got here, Duck,
other than the obvious?

03:16.537 --> 03:20.120
With the absence of hemorrhagic tissue
around the point of injury,

03:20.207 --> 03:23.125
I'd say the limb
was severed postmortem.

03:23.335 --> 03:25.826
- Time of death?
- From a leg?

03:26.088 --> 03:27.499
I'll tell you what, Gibbs.

03:27.590 --> 03:31.172
You find me a liver in that leg,
and I'll estimate you a time of death.

03:35.514 --> 03:37.721
What's that wedged in the sole?

03:43.522 --> 03:47.686
"From a small seed
a mighty trunk may grow."

03:48.527 --> 03:50.734
There's not much more
for me to do here.

03:51.030 --> 03:53.272
I saw a great antique store
around the corner.

03:53.365 --> 03:55.192
Give me a shout if you need me.

03:57.495 --> 04:00.698
Ducky! Need you here.

04:01.373 --> 04:04.374
Jethro, I refuse to speculate
on the time of death

04:04.460 --> 04:05.954
of the marine missing that leg.

04:06.045 --> 04:09.046
However, I will tell you
that the limb itself

04:09.131 --> 04:12.251
has been dead more than...
No, less than 24 hours.

04:13.427 --> 04:14.921
I'll shout if I need you.

04:20.976 --> 04:24.180
- You find the boot?
- I was just looking for junk.

04:24.396 --> 04:25.855
Stuff people throw out.

04:29.902 --> 04:31.526
- Like a boot?
- Yes.

04:32.196 --> 04:34.521
No law against taking stuff
folks thrown out.

04:36.075 --> 04:37.818
Why are you putting on rubber gloves?

04:37.910 --> 04:40.068
- We're going to need your prints.
- For what?

04:40.246 --> 04:42.534
Separate them from those we find
on the leg.

04:42.623 --> 04:44.746
You can take fingerprints off a leg?

04:48.254 --> 04:50.045
I don't get the whole tattoo thing.

04:50.548 --> 04:53.252
I'll add that to the ever-growing list
of things you don't get.

04:53.342 --> 04:56.545
Being stuck with a needle thousands
of times for a piece of artwork.

04:56.637 --> 04:58.096
No, thank you.

04:58.222 --> 05:00.096
It's more than just artwork, Tony.

05:00.182 --> 05:02.424
- On a woman, maybe.
- What?

05:02.518 --> 05:05.056
You know, on a woman.
It means she's up for anything.

05:05.145 --> 05:06.426
Abby's got tattoos.

05:07.231 --> 05:09.556
- No comment.
- All right, what about me?

05:09.650 --> 05:12.604
- You think I'm up for anything?
- Yeah, you don't have a tat.

05:12.695 --> 05:16.360
And if I did, then that would just blow
your theory to hell now, wouldn't it?

05:16.782 --> 05:19.487
Okay, say for a minute
I believe you've got one.

05:19.660 --> 05:21.071
Where is it?

05:23.122 --> 05:25.114
Nowhere you will ever see.

05:28.669 --> 05:30.994
Necessity, the mother of invention.

05:31.755 --> 05:35.421
I suspect the inventors of super glue

05:35.509 --> 05:37.336
never imagined that when heated up

05:37.428 --> 05:40.133
and applied to surfaces
in gaseous forms,

05:40.222 --> 05:42.796
its bonding capabilities would enable us

05:42.892 --> 05:45.679
to obtain fingerprints from a human leg.

05:46.729 --> 05:49.848
I like that commercial where
the guy put super glue on his hardhat

05:49.940 --> 05:53.060
and then glued his head
to the beam and hung there.

05:53.193 --> 05:55.151
I tried that with my little brother.

05:55.237 --> 05:58.523
I sense this anecdote doesn't
have a storybook ending.

05:58.616 --> 06:01.735
It does if you like your stories
to end with bald seven-year-olds.

06:01.911 --> 06:04.283
He still gets mad when I call him Kojak.

06:10.836 --> 06:14.620
So I pulled a partial off our leg
that isn't the junk collector's.

06:15.049 --> 06:18.050
- Could be the victim's.
- Run it through the military database.

06:18.844 --> 06:21.335
- So any other body parts show up?
- No.

06:21.889 --> 06:24.843
- Isn't that a little bit hinky?
- It's more than a bit.

06:24.934 --> 06:27.507
All we've got is a tattooed leg,
a sock and a boot.

06:27.603 --> 06:30.687
You're forgetting about our interesting
little bit of botanical evidence.

06:30.773 --> 06:32.849
Oh, yeah. That. Yeah.

06:33.233 --> 06:36.069
Well, I want the life history.
Family, where it grew up.

06:36.153 --> 06:39.107
- College transcripts, I know.
- Yeah.

06:39.239 --> 06:43.403
Our victim had a titanium ankle joint
which I'm about to remove.

06:43.494 --> 06:44.905
He's too young for arthritis.

06:44.995 --> 06:47.486
Yeah. It was most likely due
to an accident.

06:47.581 --> 06:51.032
- Auto, motorcycle, skiing.
- Polo.

06:52.419 --> 06:56.203
- Polo's a very dangerous sport.
- Yes, the joint will have a serial number

06:56.298 --> 06:58.789
traceable to the doctor
who performed the surgery.

06:59.051 --> 07:00.794
- Anything else?
- Well, as I suspected,

07:00.886 --> 07:03.044
our marine was
dismembered postmortem.

07:03.514 --> 07:07.428
Yes, the jagged teeth pattern
on the femur bone

07:07.518 --> 07:09.760
suggests that a saw was used.

07:09.853 --> 07:12.309
- Ouch.
- He didn't feel it, Tony.

07:12.439 --> 07:13.768
It still makes me wince.

07:13.857 --> 07:17.108
Yes. Given how straight
and clean the cut was,

07:17.569 --> 07:20.321
it was almost certainly some kind
of power saw.

07:21.865 --> 07:24.866
I wonder if they still have
the Eurail pass.

07:26.036 --> 07:27.115
Yeah.

07:27.204 --> 07:31.996
In the summer of my 18th year,
my grandfather gave me a Eurail pass

07:32.084 --> 07:35.001
to celebrate my advancement
to university.

07:35.546 --> 07:39.211
I travelled to nine different countries.

07:41.301 --> 07:45.595
Met an Austrian girl named Gisella
who left her fingerprints on my heart.

07:46.932 --> 07:50.348
Visited all the major museums
of Europe.

07:51.186 --> 07:53.309
The artwork was extraordinary.

07:54.898 --> 07:59.726
Da Vinci, Rembrandt,
Van Gogh, Renoir.

08:00.821 --> 08:03.359
- Botticelli.
- I like saying Botticelli.

08:03.657 --> 08:08.200
And that brings me to Christy Brown,
the Irish poet and painter.

08:09.204 --> 08:13.950
Yes, he suffered from cerebral palsy.
Learned to paint with his foot.

08:14.543 --> 08:15.741
Quite remarkable.

08:15.836 --> 08:19.003
He wrote an autobiography,
My Left Foot

08:19.798 --> 08:23.214
which became an exceptional film
starring Daniel Day-Lewis.

08:25.387 --> 08:26.846
That's the right foot.

08:30.684 --> 08:32.013
So it is.

08:32.686 --> 08:34.015
Oh, well.

08:36.398 --> 08:40.347
Serial number of the ankle joint
is 3274015.

08:40.443 --> 08:42.352
- One moment please.
- I'll hold.

08:45.449 --> 08:46.991
Doing something case related?

08:48.660 --> 08:51.780
Joint replacement database site
targeting orthopaedic specialists,

08:51.872 --> 08:54.873
search referenced to hospital privileges
and surgical records.

08:55.334 --> 08:56.579
All right, DiNozzo.

09:06.553 --> 09:08.048
Is it on your butt?

09:08.347 --> 09:10.754
- I told you, I was kidding.
- You only said you were kidding

09:10.849 --> 09:12.327
because you were embarrassed
you told me.

09:12.351 --> 09:14.329
- I don't have a tattoo.
- It's a butterfly, isn't it?

09:14.353 --> 09:16.429
You seem like a butterfly kind of girl.

09:17.940 --> 09:20.691
Yeah, it's a butterfly. On my hip.

09:25.280 --> 09:26.775
Yes. I'm still here.

09:28.617 --> 09:29.780
Thank you.

09:30.702 --> 09:33.372
The manufacturer shipped
our marine's titanium ankle

09:33.455 --> 09:35.946
to the naval hospital in Bethesda in '99.

09:39.211 --> 09:42.995
It was signed for by
Captain Brent Peters, May 14th, 2000.

09:43.340 --> 09:44.668
I'll call Gibbs.

09:48.512 --> 09:49.923
It's not a butterfly, is it?

09:51.682 --> 09:55.347
I remember that surgery.
We usually fuse the ankle

09:55.435 --> 09:57.677
and implant a metal splint
in our young servicemen.

09:57.771 --> 10:01.520
But his ankle was literally crushed
in an auto wreck.

10:01.608 --> 10:04.562
- May of 2000, you said.
- According to our research.

10:06.155 --> 10:10.982
Here it is. May 15th, 2000.
I implanted that ankle in.

10:11.368 --> 10:13.989
Marine Private First Class
Thomas Dorn.

10:14.371 --> 10:17.705
- What can you tell me about him?
- I can tell you a lot about his ankle.

10:17.791 --> 10:21.540
- I don't even remember the rest of him.
- Seems to be a recurring problem.

10:21.753 --> 10:23.960
- The ankle?
- No, the rest of him.

10:24.047 --> 10:26.717
His leg was found in
a Clarksburg, West Virginia trash bin

10:26.800 --> 10:28.129
early this morning.

10:28.218 --> 10:30.543
- Just the leg?
- So far.

10:31.180 --> 10:34.299
- How deteriorated was the leg?
- It wasn't.

10:34.391 --> 10:37.558
The ME estimated he died
within the previous 24 hours.

10:39.855 --> 10:41.183
There a problem?

10:41.273 --> 10:45.899
According to his military record,
PFC Dorn died two years ago.

10:52.058 --> 10:53.517
PFC Dorn's service record.

10:53.602 --> 10:55.974
He was only in the corps 11 months
before the accident.

10:56.062 --> 10:58.221
He was about to get
a medical discharge when he died.

10:58.315 --> 10:59.939
Got the death certificate.

11:00.025 --> 11:03.109
Signed by a Dr Sylvia Chalmers
in Harmony, West Virginia.

11:03.194 --> 11:04.274
Harmony?

11:04.362 --> 11:07.114
Yeah, population, 1,600.
Sounds cute, doesn't it?

11:07.198 --> 11:11.243
Cause of death, myocardial infarction.

11:12.412 --> 11:16.113
- Heart attack at 22?
- As Abby would say, pretty hinky.

11:16.374 --> 11:18.367
I do believe the die is cast, however.

11:18.460 --> 11:21.461
If your parents and grandparents live
to be old, so will you.

11:21.546 --> 11:24.880
- I had an aunt who died at seven.
- Just a theory.

11:26.843 --> 11:29.215
- Where's the autopsy report?
- There isn't one.

11:29.429 --> 11:32.632
- You mean you didn't find it.
- No. I mean no autopsy.

11:32.724 --> 11:34.885
The doctor signed a death certificate,
but that was it.

11:34.934 --> 11:36.761
Small towns.
You can get away with murder.

11:36.853 --> 11:38.513
The hell you can!

11:38.605 --> 11:42.389
You find the doctor in Harmony,
why there was no autopsy report.

11:42.484 --> 11:43.942
Find out where this body is buried.

11:44.027 --> 11:46.399
You get a court order
to dig up PFC Dorn

11:46.488 --> 11:48.611
and you have that body
shipped back here to Ducky.

11:50.742 --> 11:53.280
- Abby!
- Ducky!

11:53.662 --> 11:56.117
- Find anything?
- Nothing yet.

11:56.331 --> 11:59.036
I'll tell you one thing, though,
this guy had huge feet.

11:59.167 --> 12:01.492
I could wear this sock as a leg warmer.

12:01.753 --> 12:05.086
- What are you implying, Abby?
- I'm not implying anything.

12:05.173 --> 12:08.257
You know what they say about guys
with big hands and big feet, right?

12:08.343 --> 12:09.457
What?

12:10.720 --> 12:12.001
They're clowns.

12:15.517 --> 12:16.927
I got something.

12:24.734 --> 12:29.112
- What are you so happy about?
- I'm just looking forward to Harmony.

12:29.489 --> 12:31.067
You really like small towns?

12:32.409 --> 12:35.659
Peace and quiet. A place
where people know you by name.

12:35.745 --> 12:39.161
No Blockbuster or Starbucks
on every corner. What's not to like?

12:39.249 --> 12:40.851
It's too quiet.
Everybody knows your name.

12:40.875 --> 12:42.937
There's no Blockbusters
or Starbucks on every corner.

12:42.961 --> 12:45.878
Your big city just can't give you
what small towns can, Tony.

12:45.964 --> 12:49.831
It's a simpler way of life.
A slice of Americana.

12:49.926 --> 12:52.499
One that doesn't include
50-yard-line seats to the Redskins

12:52.595 --> 12:54.671
or women with full sets of teeth.

12:54.764 --> 12:56.887
Yeah, it always comes back
to that, doesn't it?

12:57.016 --> 12:58.926
See? You do get me.

12:59.978 --> 13:01.092
Hey, Gibbs.

13:01.312 --> 13:04.432
I ran the partial we pulled off the leg
through the military database.

13:04.524 --> 13:06.066
- Yeah?
- No match.

13:06.151 --> 13:08.392
But I did find
a piece of straw on the sock.

13:08.737 --> 13:10.729
- What kind?
- The hay kind.

13:10.947 --> 13:13.568
Just your regular basic straw.

13:15.410 --> 13:17.782
- Sorry.
- Thanks, Abs.

13:21.249 --> 13:24.618
- This is just how I pictured it.
- This is just how I pictured it.

13:33.052 --> 13:35.674
- Can I help you?
- I'm sure you can.

13:36.806 --> 13:39.973
I'm Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
NCIS.

13:41.519 --> 13:44.769
You can call me Tony.
We'd like to talk to Dr Chalmers.

13:47.942 --> 13:49.057
Darlene.

13:50.528 --> 13:51.773
Okay.

13:56.075 --> 13:58.317
Why don't you just give her
a breast exam?

13:58.703 --> 13:59.866
In good time.

14:00.121 --> 14:03.288
Our seed matured and fell in late fall.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.618
It comes from a monoecious
yellow flower. Not too showy.

14:07.712 --> 14:10.333
The male and female appearing
in March to April

14:10.423 --> 14:12.215
in separate spherical heads.

14:13.343 --> 14:16.509
The leaf is palmately veined,
it's four to eight inches wide,

14:16.596 --> 14:19.799
ovate in shape,
and has three to five lobes.

14:19.891 --> 14:22.216
Abby, are we ever going
to get to the tree?

14:24.979 --> 14:28.680
Platanus Occidentalis.
Or more commonly known as...

14:28.775 --> 14:31.017
- A sycamore tree.
- I'm afraid so.

14:31.361 --> 14:32.921
Pretty much grow everywhere,
don't they?

14:33.279 --> 14:34.359
Yup.

14:34.489 --> 14:36.031
It was a tragedy.

14:36.282 --> 14:38.856
He was such
a nice looking young marine.

14:38.952 --> 14:40.743
- Had you met him before?
- No, no.

14:40.829 --> 14:43.402
- He didn't live around here.
- Just walked in?

14:43.498 --> 14:46.665
Well, I was the only doctor
for 40 miles at the time.

14:46.876 --> 14:50.660
Dr Burger on the sign,
is he a new addition?

14:50.839 --> 14:52.796
He's buying out my practice.

14:53.049 --> 14:57.711
I still see some of the older patients
who don't trust a young doctor.

14:57.804 --> 14:59.927
He's only 37.

15:02.517 --> 15:05.055
And who brought PFC Dorn
into your office?

15:05.144 --> 15:06.639
I believe he just walked in.

15:07.730 --> 15:11.230
Thelma could have told you.
Thelma Bowman, my nurse.

15:11.609 --> 15:13.981
She died last summer. Stroke.

15:14.571 --> 15:18.236
We were together, doctor and nurse,
for nearly 30 years.

15:18.700 --> 15:21.072
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.

15:21.244 --> 15:24.411
You saw that young thing
Dr Burger hired to replace her?

15:24.831 --> 15:26.076
Sure did.

15:27.876 --> 15:29.500
I'm sorry. Go on.

15:29.669 --> 15:33.880
Well, Thelma brought
this young marine into my office,

15:33.965 --> 15:35.922
set him right down there in that chair.

15:36.259 --> 15:40.755
He couldn't catch his breath.
He was suffering extreme chest pains.

15:40.889 --> 15:43.130
Classic heart attack symptoms.

15:45.018 --> 15:49.146
Why didn't Thelma just take him
to an examination room?

15:49.439 --> 15:52.973
Well, we only have one.
And, let's see,

15:53.067 --> 15:55.689
I think the Thomas twins
was in there with the measles.

15:57.155 --> 16:00.191
Well, anyway,
before I could get up from this chair,

16:00.992 --> 16:02.155
he'd collapsed.

16:02.368 --> 16:06.318
Right where you're standing now.
And I administered CPR

16:06.414 --> 16:09.119
while Thelma called county looking
for the ambulance.

16:09.250 --> 16:12.833
Only it was over at
a car accident way out in Turtle Creek.

16:12.921 --> 16:14.545
The county only has one ambulance?

16:14.797 --> 16:17.549
You've never lived in a small county,
have you, son?

16:18.593 --> 16:22.887
- Fortunately, no.
- Well, it has its compensations.

16:24.474 --> 16:27.640
Anyway, by the time
the ambulance got here,

16:28.186 --> 16:30.060
young Dorn had expired.

16:30.480 --> 16:33.018
Why didn't the coroner do an autopsy?

16:34.317 --> 16:35.597
Well, I...

16:36.277 --> 16:38.519
I didn't feel there was a need to.

16:38.613 --> 16:40.689
- You're the coroner?
- I was.

16:41.199 --> 16:44.899
It's pro bono work.
Dr Burger's coroner now.

16:45.244 --> 16:48.827
I did do a blood test
and found elevated levels

16:48.915 --> 16:50.789
of cardiac enzymes.

16:51.209 --> 16:53.914
That and his symptoms
seemed sufficient.

16:54.087 --> 16:57.420
Not anymore. We're getting
a court order to exhume the body.

16:57.507 --> 17:00.591
Oh, my. I'm afraid
that's going to be impossible.

17:02.053 --> 17:05.220
- You had it cremated?
- No, I didn't. His sister did.

17:05.473 --> 17:08.807
She was so upset
when she identified the body.

17:09.185 --> 17:10.893
She didn't have the money
to ship him home

17:10.979 --> 17:14.679
and she wanted to scatter his ashes
over the Blue Ridge Mountains.

17:15.650 --> 17:18.355
I told her I really
should do an autopsy, but,

17:18.569 --> 17:20.776
she was so distraught over the...

17:21.364 --> 17:24.233
The thought of him being cut up.

17:27.119 --> 17:31.912
- You let her talk you out of it?
- I have known the pain of loss.

17:32.875 --> 17:37.621
I'm afraid I let hers affect me more
than it should have, professionally.

17:38.172 --> 17:40.746
That never happened to me
in all my years as a doctor.

17:43.970 --> 17:48.133
That was when I decided it was time
to retire and sell my practice.

17:52.854 --> 17:54.478
You recognise this marine?

17:57.150 --> 17:59.819
No, I don't. Why? Should I?

18:01.320 --> 18:02.731
That's PFC Thomas Dorn.

18:10.163 --> 18:12.369
- What are you thinking?
- Estée Lauder.

18:12.790 --> 18:14.913
- The perfume?
- She was wearing it.

18:15.001 --> 18:18.085
Older ladies seem to like it.
Had an ex-girlfriend who used it.

18:18.171 --> 18:21.337
- Is that why she's an ex-girlfriend?
- Exactly.

18:22.300 --> 18:24.458
How does a sister
misidentify her brother?

18:24.677 --> 18:25.922
She doesn't.

18:26.888 --> 18:28.845
We going to have to report
the autopsy screw-up?

18:28.931 --> 18:31.849
Do I detect
a soft heart thing happening here?

18:32.727 --> 18:35.681
That's it, isn't it? The tattoo's a heart.

18:36.397 --> 18:37.512
We're back on that again.

18:37.607 --> 18:39.849
I just can't imagine you getting
a tattoo, that's all.

18:39.942 --> 18:42.480
- I was drunk.
- I can't imagine you drunk either.

18:46.449 --> 18:51.075
- So, if it's not a heart...
- It's a rose on my butt.

18:51.162 --> 18:53.534
- Can we move on now?
- Sure.

18:57.085 --> 19:00.667
- So we are done with this then?
- We are done.

19:03.216 --> 19:05.089
Kate, which cheek is it on?

19:05.510 --> 19:07.716
- What killed him?
- Digitalis.

19:08.554 --> 19:10.214
- The heart medication?
- Yup.

19:10.515 --> 19:13.765
The tox level in Dorn's leg alone
was enough to kill a bull.

19:13.851 --> 19:16.389
Would an overdose give
the symptoms of a heart attack?

19:16.479 --> 19:18.103
Not just the symptoms.

19:19.565 --> 19:22.187
Okay. So you think our leg

19:22.276 --> 19:25.941
and that marine that died two years ago
of a heart attack are tied together.

19:26.572 --> 19:28.529
I do not believe in coincidences.

19:28.616 --> 19:32.483
What about that rock formation on the
moon that looks like Jay Leno's chin?

19:32.620 --> 19:35.621
- It's perfectly normal.
- On a race track maybe.

19:35.706 --> 19:37.450
Women will never understand

19:37.792 --> 19:40.283
taking a little car ride
and trying to beat your best time.

19:40.378 --> 19:43.961
- I hate it when men do that.
- See, this is a woman thing.

19:44.966 --> 19:46.792
- How did you do?
- Pretty good.

19:46.884 --> 19:50.170
I beat my time by four minutes.
Including construction detours.

19:50.263 --> 19:51.342
In Harmony.

19:53.141 --> 19:55.098
Doc Chalmers
is a very sweet little old lady

19:55.184 --> 19:58.387
who unfortunately also happens
to be the local coroner.

20:00.606 --> 20:02.314
Small town, boss. Small town.

20:02.692 --> 20:05.361
A woman claiming
to be Dorn's sister IDed the body

20:05.444 --> 20:09.228
and then conned her into skipping
the autopsy and cremating the body.

20:09.323 --> 20:11.281
Cremation. It's a dead end.

20:14.162 --> 20:15.276
What?

20:16.706 --> 20:18.330
This woman must be
some sweet talker.

20:18.416 --> 20:21.037
Well, it's more Dr Chalmers
is a very connable little old lady.

20:21.127 --> 20:23.879
Probably gets her roof shingled
and her driveway tarred every year.

20:23.963 --> 20:25.208
Does Dorn even have a sister?

20:25.298 --> 20:27.670
His military file indicates
his only living relative

20:27.758 --> 20:29.466
is a half-sister, Melissa Dorn.

20:29.552 --> 20:30.631
Put a trace on her?

20:30.720 --> 20:34.848
I did the best I can balancing my laptop
while pulling five-G turns.

20:36.350 --> 20:40.562
That's an exaggeration, boss.
I mean, maybe three Gs once.

20:44.525 --> 20:48.440
- 10 Mill Road, Comus, Maryland.
- Keys.

20:48.821 --> 20:50.814
What? I can't drive
because Kate's a chicken?

20:50.907 --> 20:52.021
I'm not a chicken.

20:52.116 --> 20:53.717
You can't drive
because you're not going.

20:53.784 --> 20:55.860
That's different. Why aren't I going?

20:55.995 --> 20:58.782
Because you're gonna be doing
a background check on Melissa Dorn.

20:58.873 --> 21:00.118
Kate, you coming?

21:02.919 --> 21:05.873
Abs, do you know
where Kate has her tat?

21:06.214 --> 21:07.293
Yup.

21:18.768 --> 21:20.392
Watch her body language.

21:20.478 --> 21:22.554
What are we looking for,
short of a confession?

21:22.647 --> 21:26.976
Sometimes, it's not what they say,
it's what they don't say.

21:27.235 --> 21:29.476
Which translates into,
we don't have a search warrant

21:29.570 --> 21:31.064
and this is the easiest way in.

21:38.412 --> 21:41.616
- What's wrong?
- You know what kind of tree this is?

21:42.375 --> 21:44.248
Botany was my weakest subject.

21:45.795 --> 21:47.289
Sycamore.

22:00.876 --> 22:02.833
Hi. Can I help you?

22:04.171 --> 22:05.665
You already have.

22:14.098 --> 22:17.798
You would have liked Tommy.
He was the life of the party.

22:18.602 --> 22:21.223
- He was your half-brother.
- Yeah.

22:22.356 --> 22:26.223
We were raised by our father.
You have any brothers and sisters?

22:26.694 --> 22:28.900
- No.
- An only child?

22:29.571 --> 22:32.109
- I figured as much.
- How so?

22:32.241 --> 22:34.732
You have all the classic traits
of a first-born.

22:34.827 --> 22:39.074
Confident, pays attention
to detail, perfectionist.

22:39.540 --> 22:42.743
- Difficulty sharing.
- Guilty, guilty, guilty.

22:44.420 --> 22:45.582
Depends.

22:50.634 --> 22:54.714
- So why the visit after two years?
- We're working on another case.

22:55.180 --> 22:59.510
- There might be a tenuous connection.
- How can I help?

22:59.601 --> 23:02.306
Do you have any
of your brother's personal effects?

23:02.938 --> 23:06.521
Anything that I didn't donate,
I threw away.

23:07.276 --> 23:09.648
It would've made me sad.

23:11.447 --> 23:13.439
Where are my manners?

23:13.532 --> 23:16.948
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yeah, I'd love some coffee.

23:21.999 --> 23:24.122
None for me, thanks.

23:27.129 --> 23:29.834
This may be
the cleanest kitchen I've ever seen.

23:29.923 --> 23:32.379
Well, that's because
it's never been used.

23:33.302 --> 23:36.801
- You're not the domestic type, huh?
- No.

23:38.056 --> 23:41.057
I eat over the sink,
so I don't have plates to wash.

23:41.477 --> 23:44.146
- Do you even have plates?
- Paper.

23:50.319 --> 23:53.984
- This is a big house for one person.
- And two cats.

23:56.658 --> 24:00.027
- Do you like cats?
- They don't much like me.

24:00.120 --> 24:02.790
- How can you tell?
- By the way they look at me.

24:05.501 --> 24:08.916
I hate to break it to you,
but cats only have one expression.

24:11.256 --> 24:13.165
- Thank you.
- You should actually try it

24:13.258 --> 24:14.421
before you thank me.

24:20.933 --> 24:23.340
- Yeah, it's perfect. Thank you.
- Really?

24:29.191 --> 24:30.270
You're right.

24:32.486 --> 24:34.110
I like your tattoo.

24:37.950 --> 24:42.528
- It means...
- Peace, health, prosperity.

24:42.621 --> 24:44.495
You know Chinese.

24:46.750 --> 24:48.790
Any other hidden talents
I should know about?

24:48.877 --> 24:51.878
I can sample the frosting on a cake
without leaving a fingerprint.

24:51.964 --> 24:53.078
Wow.

24:55.509 --> 24:59.672
This is going to sound terrible, but,

25:00.305 --> 25:04.385
I hope whatever you're investigating
is tied to Tom.

25:05.394 --> 25:06.473
Why?

25:06.937 --> 25:10.388
Well, then I wouldn't need
to make up an excuse to see you.

25:15.863 --> 25:17.939
You weren't buying any of that,
were you?

25:19.283 --> 25:23.150
- Any of what?
- You know, her charm.

25:23.245 --> 25:27.077
Is it really that hard to believe, Kate,
that I might be attractive to a woman?

25:27.541 --> 25:28.952
That's not what I meant.

25:29.710 --> 25:32.248
Did you find us anything
to get us a search warrant?

25:32.921 --> 25:34.830
Well, she told you that she lives alone,

25:34.923 --> 25:37.212
but the toilet seat was up
in the downstairs bathroom.

25:38.552 --> 25:40.260
You can tell that one to the judge.

25:40.387 --> 25:43.008
Okay, well, Abby found
a piece of straw in Dorn's sock

25:43.098 --> 25:44.972
and there is a barn around the back.

25:46.351 --> 25:49.518
Okay, I found nothing
to give us probable cause.

25:51.023 --> 25:52.481
Maybe, I did.

25:53.775 --> 25:54.855
Question.

25:55.235 --> 25:56.777
Can you match DNA from trees

25:56.862 --> 25:59.104
- like you can with humans?
- Absolutely.

25:59.197 --> 26:02.649
Plant DNA, like human DNA,
is unique to each plant.

26:02.743 --> 26:05.578
So you can distinguish
one sycamore tree from another.

26:05.704 --> 26:10.580
Okay. Try matching these
to the seed we found in Dorn's boot.

26:12.085 --> 26:14.078
Is the other sample
from another location?

26:14.171 --> 26:15.630
No, same tree.

26:16.340 --> 26:18.913
- So you want me to run the test twice?
- Yeah.

26:19.968 --> 26:23.135
Okay. How long before you
have something on both samples?

26:23.388 --> 26:26.058
Depends on whether or not
you want it fast or you want it right.

26:26.141 --> 26:27.683
- Both.
- Both.

26:28.852 --> 26:32.019
You need four to the seven divided by...

26:32.606 --> 26:35.144
- Six hours.
- Clock's ticking, Abs.

26:40.614 --> 26:42.772
Six-letter word for reason
to commit a crime?

26:43.825 --> 26:47.444
Come on, don't tense up.
Starts with "M."

26:48.872 --> 26:50.948
- Murder.
- No. Motive.

26:51.041 --> 26:52.500
Murder is a motive.

26:53.460 --> 26:54.658
What do you have?

26:54.753 --> 26:56.995
Six-letter word for reason
to commit a crime.

26:57.089 --> 26:59.295
- DiNozzo.
- That's seven letters.

26:59.383 --> 27:01.459
Works for me. What do you got?

27:02.386 --> 27:03.880
PFC Dorn.

27:04.388 --> 27:06.594
Purchased a term policy for $750,000

27:06.682 --> 27:09.137
two months before his heart attack
in Harmony.

27:09.226 --> 27:13.520
- Beneficiary is his only living relative.
- His half-sister, Melissa.

27:14.481 --> 27:18.431
She and Dorn fed some sucker digitalis
and dropped him off in Harmony.

27:18.527 --> 27:22.311
Harmony, a small, crappy town where
she identifies the sucker as her brother,

27:22.614 --> 27:27.027
cons the old lady coroner with
crocodile tears into cremating the body

27:27.119 --> 27:28.447
and not performing an autopsy.

27:28.537 --> 27:30.017
The insurance company paid the claim?

27:30.080 --> 27:32.571
- It sure did.
- Get the name of the adjuster?

27:33.417 --> 27:35.990
Stanley Borden,
Rexford Mutual, Baltimore.

27:36.837 --> 27:38.212
Why are you two still here?

27:38.964 --> 27:41.669
Come on, Kate. You're only going
10 miles over the limit.

27:41.758 --> 27:43.383
And that's pushing it.

27:43.468 --> 27:46.920
What good is it being an armed
federal agent if you can't drive fast?

27:47.014 --> 27:49.718
- You get to shoot bad guys.
- True.

27:50.726 --> 27:52.683
You should have seen Gibbs
with Melissa.

27:52.769 --> 27:55.094
- He threaten to shoot her?
- No, just the opposite.

27:55.188 --> 27:57.015
He was flirting with her.

27:57.315 --> 28:00.482
- I didn't think he had it in him.
- He had it in him at some point.

28:01.319 --> 28:03.146
He has been married three times.

28:03.238 --> 28:06.524
- All redheads.
- But Melissa's a redhead.

28:07.284 --> 28:08.363
Explains it.

28:08.452 --> 28:11.655
Wait, so is that woman who picks
him up now and then. Who is she?

28:11.830 --> 28:13.372
Not a clue.

28:13.749 --> 28:16.500
So he could really
be attracted to Melissa?

28:16.710 --> 28:18.537
You can't control
who you're attracted to.

28:18.628 --> 28:21.202
That whole Julia Roberts,
Lyle Lovett thing proves that.

28:21.298 --> 28:23.041
- Billy Joel, Christie Brinkley.
- I get it.

28:23.133 --> 28:26.087
- Angelina Jolie, Billy Bob Thornton.
- You haven't answered my question.

28:26.178 --> 28:28.847
Paulina Porizkova and that guy
from The Cars. If you're asking me

28:28.930 --> 28:32.845
whether Gibbs could get involved with
a murder suspect, the answer is no.

28:33.685 --> 28:38.062
Three redheaded ex-wives shows
his judgement is a little questionable.

28:40.609 --> 28:42.352
None of them were murder suspects.

28:45.781 --> 28:47.857
Although, I don't know
about the redhead

28:47.949 --> 28:49.574
who picks him up now and then.

28:50.660 --> 28:54.528
A 22-year-old marine buys
a term life policy for $750,000,

28:54.623 --> 28:57.030
then kicks two months later
from a heart attack?

28:58.668 --> 29:00.827
There's no way I wanted
to pay that claim.

29:00.921 --> 29:02.331
But you did.

29:02.964 --> 29:04.708
I was overruled from upstairs.

29:05.509 --> 29:08.545
$750,000 question. Why?

29:09.179 --> 29:10.839
The sister threatened to sue.

29:11.515 --> 29:14.681
See, juries get angry
when insurance companies don't pay.

29:14.768 --> 29:16.511
Especially to the only survivor

29:16.603 --> 29:18.892
of a marine injured
while serving his country.

29:18.980 --> 29:20.688
They tend to award very large

29:20.774 --> 29:23.181
multimillion-dollar payments
as punishment.

29:23.860 --> 29:27.027
- Cheaper to pay her off.
- It's our form of insurance.

29:27.614 --> 29:29.357
Anything turn up in the investigation?

29:29.991 --> 29:32.565
- Nothing that would convince a jury.
- Try us.

29:34.663 --> 29:37.580
Okay. But you two think like her lawyer.

29:38.208 --> 29:40.414
Why'd he buy a big policy
at such a young age

29:40.502 --> 29:42.541
and name a half-sister beneficiary?

29:42.629 --> 29:45.796
Half-sister or not,
she was his only living relative.

29:46.174 --> 29:48.961
Then why'd your salesman sell it to him
if it was so unusual?

29:49.052 --> 29:52.053
Why was he cremated
before an autopsy could be performed

29:52.139 --> 29:53.681
at the sister's request?

29:54.224 --> 29:56.596
Coroner thought
an autopsy was unnecessary.

29:56.685 --> 29:59.010
Many people prefer cremation
over tombs.

29:59.771 --> 30:02.938
- Do I need to go on?
- No, you made your point.

30:03.066 --> 30:05.687
If you can prove this was a scam,
we'll recover something.

30:05.777 --> 30:07.236
If only satisfaction.

30:13.410 --> 30:15.782
Six cups and it isn't even noon.

30:16.788 --> 30:20.916
- Duck, this one's bothering me.
- Yeah, so Abby said.

30:21.001 --> 30:23.207
You have her doing the same test twice.

30:25.297 --> 30:29.591
Dorn's leg shows up in a trash bin.
Tox screen shows digitalis

30:29.926 --> 30:32.797
which is probably
what he and/or his sister

30:32.888 --> 30:37.217
gave the marine in Harmony two years
ago to pull off an insurance scam.

30:37.309 --> 30:41.603
- Sounds reasonable.
- So who killed Dorn a few days ago?

30:42.314 --> 30:44.353
Why toss his leg into a trash bin?

30:44.566 --> 30:46.642
And why can't we find
the rest of his body?

30:46.776 --> 30:49.777
You know, I recall a case
in the Forensic Journal

30:50.030 --> 30:52.271
where the only evidence was a thumb

30:52.365 --> 30:55.450
found in the coin return of a pay phone.

30:57.871 --> 31:01.240
- Yeah? And?
- Well, that's the only part I remember.

31:01.625 --> 31:03.913
Ducky, this is not helping me.

31:04.169 --> 31:08.878
Have you identified the body
the sister claims was Dorn's?

31:08.965 --> 31:11.752
Cremated and spread over
the Blue Ridge Mountains.

31:12.302 --> 31:15.718
- That does pose a problem.
- Duck.

31:18.934 --> 31:21.259
Who would you get
to pose as a marine?

31:21.394 --> 31:22.474
You.

31:25.899 --> 31:28.105
Yeah. Yeah.

31:37.118 --> 31:38.447
I would.

31:56.304 --> 31:57.467
Match.

32:04.229 --> 32:06.221
It's not from the same tree.

32:10.043 --> 32:14.836
The manual says it takes three minutes
to change a tyre on a LAV-25.

32:16.091 --> 32:18.499
The manual was written
by an army pogue.

32:20.178 --> 32:22.301
I say marines can do it in less than two.

32:22.681 --> 32:24.555
- What do you say?
- Oo-rah!

32:24.850 --> 32:26.095
Make it happen.

32:26.685 --> 32:31.228
Gunny Vestman.
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

32:32.190 --> 32:34.860
I recall an MP Gibbs at Lejeune.

32:34.985 --> 32:37.690
- Long time ago.
- Could be.

32:38.238 --> 32:41.939
- He was high and tight.
- It's not exactly long and shaggy, Gunny.

32:42.034 --> 32:43.825
Seen sheep dogs shorter.

32:45.245 --> 32:48.032
- Don't recall you.
- Court Street. Jayville.

32:48.123 --> 32:49.783
I broke up a lot of brawls there.

32:49.917 --> 32:52.586
Yeah, I was one of them.
Got me a week in the brig.

32:52.669 --> 32:54.247
Gonna hold that against me?

32:55.714 --> 32:56.829
Nah.

32:56.924 --> 32:58.631
He was one
of the better prison chasers.

32:58.717 --> 33:01.884
He gave us smoke breaks on our
work detail. That's why I remember you.

33:02.387 --> 33:03.716
45 seconds!

33:04.056 --> 33:07.259
- How can I help you, Gibbs?
- PFC Thomas Dorn.

33:07.893 --> 33:11.060
Ain't heard that sandbagger's name
since he ODed a couple years ago.

33:11.146 --> 33:14.930
- Death certificate says heart attack.
- Coke induced, I'll bet.

33:15.025 --> 33:18.524
If he was a cokehead,
why didn't you boot his butt out?

33:18.612 --> 33:22.063
- Car accident beat me to it.
- He have any buds?

33:22.157 --> 33:25.360
A couple.
He was tight with a Corporal Morgan.

33:26.411 --> 33:31.073
- He went UA same time Dorn kicked.
- Bet you never found him, right?

33:31.500 --> 33:32.958
Not that I heard of.

33:33.043 --> 33:35.249
Probably holed up
in some backwater-ville

33:35.337 --> 33:37.579
with that redhead they used to run with.

33:37.798 --> 33:40.585
- Melissa.
- Yeah, that's her name.

33:40.926 --> 33:42.040
She was a fox.

33:42.135 --> 33:45.136
And both Dorn and Morgan
were shacking up with her.

33:45.430 --> 33:48.265
- You know her?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know her.

33:48.558 --> 33:51.927
- Dorn's half-sister.
- She didn't act like no sister.

33:52.688 --> 33:54.182
A minute-30!

33:54.398 --> 33:56.770
Why you asking me about this now?

33:58.193 --> 34:01.692
Dorn's leg was found deep-sixed
in a dumpster two days ago.

34:01.780 --> 34:02.895
Two days?

34:03.448 --> 34:07.113
- Some ghoul dig him up?
- No. He had beaucoup life insurance.

34:07.869 --> 34:08.949
From what you just told me,

34:09.036 --> 34:12.038
it looks like he and Melissa
killed Corporal Morgan.

34:12.123 --> 34:13.949
She identified the body as Dorn,

34:14.918 --> 34:17.753
cremated him, claimed the insurance.

34:19.672 --> 34:24.418
- Who killed Dorn?
- Well, foxy lady may be a black widow.

34:25.344 --> 34:26.507
Oo-rah!

34:30.559 --> 34:32.053
You want to tell them?

34:36.313 --> 34:37.938
- Oo-rah!
- Oo-rah!

34:42.279 --> 34:44.603
- What's wrong?
- Look at it.

34:46.283 --> 34:47.824
Looks like a match.

34:48.452 --> 34:50.824
- Precisely.
- Good work, Abby.

34:50.911 --> 34:52.157
No, it's not.

34:52.246 --> 34:54.619
You gave me two samples
from the same tree.

34:54.708 --> 34:58.041
"B" matched and "A" didn't.
I screwed up.

34:58.128 --> 35:00.251
Sycamore "A" was from
a tree down the street.

35:00.881 --> 35:01.960
What?

35:02.049 --> 35:06.924
The idea of matching plant DNA
was a bit hinky for me.

35:07.387 --> 35:10.139
"O ye of little faith."

35:10.390 --> 35:13.475
Abby, come on.
All I did is give you a blind test.

35:13.602 --> 35:15.511
Well, you could have done that
by not telling me

35:15.604 --> 35:17.976
which sample came
from the suspect sycamore.

35:18.356 --> 35:19.555
I didn't think of that.

35:22.360 --> 35:25.397
This puts Dorn at Melissa's house.

35:25.822 --> 35:27.400
You know what that means?

35:28.742 --> 35:30.236
You've got probable cause.

35:36.541 --> 35:39.376
Tony, you take the barn.
Kate, you got the house.

35:39.461 --> 35:41.169
What're you gonna take?

35:41.379 --> 35:43.140
That didn't come out right.
Not what I meant.

35:43.173 --> 35:44.336
Yeah, I know what you meant.

35:50.889 --> 35:53.345
Well, was my coffee that good?

35:54.684 --> 35:56.558
We're here to execute a search warrant.

35:57.229 --> 35:58.391
For what?

36:01.316 --> 36:03.309
My brother died two years ago.

36:04.402 --> 36:06.146
His body was cremated.

36:06.238 --> 36:09.441
Don't you mean it was Corporal
Morgan's body that was cremated?

36:19.209 --> 36:21.498
This has to be the cleanest barn ever.

36:22.170 --> 36:24.922
If she uses a service,
I got to have that number.

36:42.732 --> 36:45.650
I really don't know
what you think you're going to find here.

36:48.113 --> 36:50.189
Why do you keep staring at me?

36:52.075 --> 36:55.693
I could never have killed Tommy.
I loved him.

36:56.246 --> 36:58.737
A Gunny who knew both of you told me
the same thing.

37:01.084 --> 37:04.535
Funny, though. He didn't know
that you were brother and sister.

37:16.516 --> 37:18.592
Looks like you could use
a glass of water.

37:53.428 --> 37:54.543
Thank you.

37:55.722 --> 37:58.758
Have Abby compare her prints
with those on her brother's leg.

38:05.523 --> 38:08.524
Blood on the floor.
Nicks in the concrete.

38:09.194 --> 38:11.233
Looks like they were made
by a power saw.

38:11.321 --> 38:13.563
Got to be where she did
her slicing and dicing.

38:28.004 --> 38:29.748
- What?
- There's someone else.

39:00.036 --> 39:01.365
Who else is here?

39:02.956 --> 39:04.154
Who else is here?

39:22.100 --> 39:25.635
Boss, I'd like you
to meet Dr Sylvia Chalmers

39:26.563 --> 39:28.472
who loves Estée Lauder.

39:32.360 --> 39:33.819
Dr Chalmers!

39:34.362 --> 39:37.067
Good afternoon, Agent Todd.

39:37.157 --> 39:39.778
- You were in on it.
- In on what, my dear?

39:40.118 --> 39:43.569
- They know, Mama.
- Mama?

39:47.751 --> 39:51.084
They didn't know I was your Mama
till you told them, dear.

39:53.298 --> 39:56.299
I know I should
have told you all back in Harmony,

39:56.593 --> 39:59.759
but the mother in me had
to protect my only child.

40:00.138 --> 40:02.427
It was wrong, I know that.

40:02.766 --> 40:05.553
But her wicked half-brother
intimidated her

40:05.643 --> 40:08.514
into defrauding an insurance company

40:08.605 --> 40:11.178
when his friend had a heart attack.

40:11.274 --> 40:13.847
Brought on by an overdose of digitalis.

40:14.527 --> 40:16.935
What in the world
would make you think that?

40:17.405 --> 40:19.813
Couldn't be from a forensic test.

40:19.908 --> 40:22.659
Melissa had his body cremated.

40:25.163 --> 40:26.990
Notice how it's all you, Melissa?

40:31.378 --> 40:34.497
A marine has a heart attack
in my office.

40:34.589 --> 40:38.373
Melissa identifies him
as her half-brother who I've never met.

40:39.219 --> 40:41.128
Now, how am I involved?

40:42.013 --> 40:43.970
- Mother.
- Melissa.

40:44.516 --> 40:46.971
You defrauded an insurance company.

40:47.519 --> 40:50.685
I'm afraid you're gonna
have to take their punishment for that.

40:52.065 --> 40:53.524
And only that.

40:55.777 --> 40:59.525
Boy, oh, boy, you are good.
But so are we.

40:59.739 --> 41:03.025
We found your digitalis
in Thomas Dorn's leg.

41:03.785 --> 41:05.113
My digitalis?

41:05.453 --> 41:09.202
Every doctor and hospital
in this country uses digitalis.

41:09.332 --> 41:11.538
Each order has
its own chemical marker.

41:11.793 --> 41:15.043
How else would a manufacturer recall
a specific batch

41:15.422 --> 41:17.461
if they had a quality control problem?

41:21.386 --> 41:22.845
You shouldn't have done it, Mama.

41:22.929 --> 41:25.135
Calm yourself, Melissa.
Just calm yourself.

41:25.515 --> 41:29.098
They can only prove that you defrauded
an insurance company.

41:29.185 --> 41:30.514
No, Mama.

41:32.397 --> 41:34.224
They can prove everything.

41:34.399 --> 41:38.064
They know you killed them with digitalis.

41:38.236 --> 41:40.394
They know you cut up Tommy
into little pieces

41:40.488 --> 41:42.896
and they know you threw him away
in the garbage.

41:45.910 --> 41:50.122
She's just hysterical.
You can't use any of this in court.

41:51.458 --> 41:55.076
She was read her rights.
She waived them.

41:56.463 --> 41:59.914
We can use it all. We will.

42:04.762 --> 42:07.929
You little fool.
They couldn't prove anything.

42:08.892 --> 42:10.849
I don't care anymore, Mama.

42:12.937 --> 42:15.428
I loved Tommy and you murdered him.

42:28.703 --> 42:31.870
They just found the left arm
in the garbage dump at Chiefton.

42:31.956 --> 42:33.581
So where does that leave us?

42:33.875 --> 42:36.876
That's a right arm from Katy Lick,
a torso from Marshville

42:36.961 --> 42:39.203
and the original leg
from the dumpster in Clarksburg.

42:39.297 --> 42:40.577
Still no head or left leg?

42:40.673 --> 42:42.443
Well, which I'm betting
are gonna be turning up

42:42.467 --> 42:44.673
around Lake Floyd or Jarvisville.

42:45.178 --> 42:46.589
Did you check Hooterville?

42:47.514 --> 42:50.882
- Where's Hooterville?
- You guys, Petticoat Junction.

42:50.975 --> 42:52.932
Green Acres. Hooterville.

42:53.436 --> 42:57.481
- I prefer TV shows from this century.
- Come on, they're hilarious.

42:57.565 --> 43:00.934
When we were in college,
we had this drinking game and

43:01.236 --> 43:03.442
the drugs collect in a solvent layer

43:04.155 --> 43:07.489
and that leaves only proteins
and biological material behind.

43:08.368 --> 43:12.235
That's great, Abby.
I'll make sure to get that in the report.

43:12.330 --> 43:13.445
What report?

43:13.540 --> 43:15.497
We've got Humpty Dumpty
back together?

43:15.833 --> 43:19.499
- Most of him.
- Melon and left leg are still outstanding.

43:20.171 --> 43:24.500
- Any more tattoos?
- Just the rose on Kate's butt.

43:25.385 --> 43:26.843
It's not a rose.

43:35.436 --> 43:36.847
He doesn't know.

43:36.938 --> 43:39.476
He's lying just like he did
about the digitalis.

43:42.026 --> 43:43.521
Okay, tell them.

43:46.197 --> 43:47.276
Gibbs.
