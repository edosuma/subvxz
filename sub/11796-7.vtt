00:02.035 --> 00:03.737
( bell rings )

00:03.770 --> 00:06.705
 <i>* When I wake up in the</i>
 <i>morning and the alarm</i>
 <i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.740 --> 00:09.609
 <i>* I don't think</i>
 <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.642 --> 00:12.479
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.512 --> 00:16.383
 <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
 <i>just in time</i>
 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.416 --> 00:19.719
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:21.788 --> 00:24.824
  <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
  <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:27.827
  <i>* And my dog ate</i>
  <i>all my homework last night</i>

00:27.861 --> 00:30.730
 <i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>
 <i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

00:30.764 --> 00:34.501

00:34.534 --> 00:38.505
 <i>* It's all right</i>

00:52.686 --> 00:55.722
  <i>* It's all right</i>

00:58.758 --> 01:02.462
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:15.308 --> 01:17.277
  Hey, and it's a touchdown.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.746
 It's checkmate.
 They're playing chess,
 not football.

01:19.779 --> 01:21.281
 Yeah, right.

01:21.314 --> 01:23.483
  Arnold Dilton of St. Murray's
  has just crushed

01:23.516 --> 01:26.386
   Bayside's own
   Franklin Finkley.

01:26.419 --> 01:29.222
   ( crowd cheers )

01:29.255 --> 01:32.125
   That sure was
   an exciting match,
   wasn't it, Zack?

01:32.158 --> 01:35.595
 There's nothing more thrilling
 than geek-to-geek combat.

01:37.330 --> 01:40.600
 Okay, this is the moment
 you've all been waiting for.

01:40.633 --> 01:44.104
  Playing for St. Murray's,
  it's Steven Bijou;

01:47.107 --> 01:50.310
 And Bayside's champion,
 our very own Screech Powers.

01:50.343 --> 01:52.612
  ( crowd chanting )
  Screech, Screech...

01:52.645 --> 01:54.581
  Oh, Samuel, I'm so excited.

01:54.614 --> 01:58.485
   Not everyone gets to be
   the girlfriend
   of a chess jock.

01:58.518 --> 02:00.553
May the best brain win.

02:00.587 --> 02:03.356
 Go ahead, hunk of mine,
 annihilate the dork.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.392
  ( snorting laughter )
  I mean...

02:05.425 --> 02:07.527
 you forgot your lucky beret.

02:07.560 --> 02:10.597
   How could I forget?
   I haven't lost
   since you gave it to me.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.332
 Here.

02:13.433 --> 02:16.436
 Perfect.
 Now show me that killer look.

02:18.505 --> 02:21.341
Pawn, rook, bishop, knight,
let's go Bayside,
fight, fight, fight.

02:21.374 --> 02:25.111
 Pawn, bishop, rook, queen,
 Bayside is the winning team.

02:33.520 --> 02:37.691
Okay, chess freaks, another
thrilling match
is about to begin.

02:39.492 --> 02:44.631
 Jessie: Screech starts off
 with a traditional
 Latvian King's Pawn Gamit.

02:44.664 --> 02:47.634
 - Go,
 Screech, flatten his king.
 - Shh-hh!

02:49.202 --> 02:50.603
   ( chanting )
   Quiet down, concentrate.

02:50.637 --> 02:53.340
   Come on, Screech,
   think checkmate.

02:55.775 --> 02:57.510
  Checkmate.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.349
 And the game is over.
 Screech wins the semi-finals

03:02.382 --> 03:05.485
and goes on to
the championship
against Valley.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.487
 Will you autograph my program?

03:07.520 --> 03:10.724
  If you beat Valley next week,
  you'll be famous.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.660
Famous?

03:13.693 --> 03:16.363
  With the right promotion
  he could be famous

03:16.396 --> 03:18.431
 and I could be rich.

03:19.399 --> 03:22.168
 Okay, gather round,
 gather round.

03:23.269 --> 03:25.672
How many of you
know this face?

03:25.705 --> 03:28.675
  You may think this is regular
  old scrawny Screech...

03:28.708 --> 03:30.377
- No-oo!
- ...but you're wrong.

03:30.410 --> 03:32.212
  It's Bayside's chess hero.

03:32.245 --> 03:35.315
  - I say machoism is dead.
  - Right, Preppie.

03:35.348 --> 03:38.251
Big burly biceps like these
are yesterday's news.

03:38.284 --> 03:41.488
  Little bony arms like these
  are what's happening today.

03:41.521 --> 03:45.225
  Yes, today's man
  has mental muscles.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.560
   So get your very own
   Screech T-shirts.

03:47.594 --> 03:50.296
   And what a bargain,
   only $10 apiece.

03:50.330 --> 03:51.664
   I'll buy a dozen.

03:51.698 --> 03:55.001
  I can't help myself,
  I'm a fool in love.

03:55.101 --> 03:57.570
  - Here you go.
  - Screech T-shirt.

04:03.710 --> 04:06.613
 Hey, Slater, look what
 just crawled out of the sewer.

04:06.646 --> 04:08.248
  Vinnie and Guy-Guy.

04:08.281 --> 04:09.449
 Screech: The Master cousins.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.418
Holy potatoes!

04:11.451 --> 04:13.286
We didn't
crawl out of no sewer.

04:13.319 --> 04:16.488
  Yeah, we hitched a ride
  on a garbage truck.

04:17.824 --> 04:19.625
 What do you two losers want?

04:19.659 --> 04:23.396
 We came to
 discuss a little wager
 on the chess finals.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.365
  We'll put our money
  on Screech any day.

04:25.398 --> 04:27.067
  - Yeah.
  - You're gonna win, right?

04:27.067 --> 04:29.536
 O ye of little faith.

04:29.569 --> 04:32.405
 No problem, I beat Spencer
 every time we play.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.674
- Zack: All right.
- Slater: Okay,

04:34.708 --> 04:37.610
  but if we're gonna bet,
  let's make it interesting.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.412
 - How about 100 bucks?
 - Vinnie: You're on.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.349
 And guess what?
 Spencer transferred.

04:42.382 --> 04:45.318
  Meet Peter Breznev,

04:45.352 --> 04:48.421
   Valley's new Russian
   exchange student.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.824
  And not only is he Russian,

04:50.857 --> 04:53.426
  he's from the Soviet Union.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.635
  I have your queen
  and you're in check

05:02.669 --> 05:05.505
   with an Arabian Knight Trap,
   what do you do? Ha!

05:05.538 --> 05:08.508
   Is simple,
   I use
   the Spassky Bishop Block.

05:08.541 --> 05:11.745
  The Spassky Bishop Block!
  How'd you know about that?

05:11.778 --> 05:15.849
  Spassky is my uncle, although
  Aunt Sophia has
  thicker mustache.

05:17.384 --> 05:19.319
Oh my goodness.

05:19.352 --> 05:21.788
Hey, Screech.
Screech, what's wrong?

05:21.821 --> 05:25.892
  What's wrong?
  Spassky
  practically invented chess.

05:25.925 --> 05:27.827
I don't stand a chance.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.896
I may as well quit now.

05:29.929 --> 05:32.332
 Sammy, you haven't come
 this far to quit now.

05:32.365 --> 05:35.402
   Screech, don't listen
   to those guys,
   they're all talk.

05:35.435 --> 05:38.405
I know, but they're
saying the right words.

05:38.438 --> 05:41.574
  Screech, you're undefeated,
  you're Bayside's champion,

05:41.608 --> 05:42.909
you're the best
checkers player around.

05:42.942 --> 05:44.811
   - Chess.
   - Whatever. You're good.

05:44.844 --> 05:48.748
 Besides that, you've got
 something he doesn't have,
 your lucky beret.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.784
  Hey, that's right.

05:51.651 --> 05:53.520
I do, don't I?

05:53.553 --> 05:56.589
  You will win, you will win,
  you will win, you will win!

05:56.623 --> 05:58.391
   ( roars )

06:01.761 --> 06:04.564
   All right,
   Mr. Fancy-Pants Russian,

06:04.597 --> 06:06.433
I'll meet you at
the chessboard.

06:06.466 --> 06:08.702
 - All right.
 - Way to go, Screech.

06:08.735 --> 06:10.937
And as for you two
muckety-mucks,

06:11.037 --> 06:14.107
 let's double...
 nay, triple that bet.

06:14.140 --> 06:15.742
Triple?

06:15.775 --> 06:18.845
Coach:
...48... 49... and 50.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.548
 All right, enough of these
 brain aerobics.

06:21.581 --> 06:24.784
Let's continue on
with our finger flexes.

06:24.818 --> 06:28.154
  Oh, no more, no more, Coach,
  you're pushing us too hard.

06:28.188 --> 06:31.691
  Suck it up, Finkley.
  Remember, no pain, no gain.

06:31.725 --> 06:35.628
 And a one and two
 and squeeze, squeeze.

06:35.662 --> 06:38.765
 One and two
 and squeeze, squeeze.

06:38.798 --> 06:40.633
  Not so hard there, Powers.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.635
   Save yourself for Valley.

06:42.669 --> 06:46.740
  You're right, I wouldn't want
  to get chess finger
  before the big game.

06:46.773 --> 06:50.510
  All right now, everybody,
  let's pair off
  for scrimmaging.

06:50.543 --> 06:52.746
   Finkley,
   you play Powers.

06:52.779 --> 06:56.583
   Oh no, don't make me,
   he's ruthless,
   I'll do anything.

07:00.020 --> 07:03.556
 Don't worry, Finkley,
 I'll go easy on you.

07:10.730 --> 07:13.500
  Okay, smile for the camera.

07:15.902 --> 07:17.837
   25 bucks.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.939
 - Here you go.
 - What are you doing?

07:20.040 --> 07:21.841
- Exploiting you.
- Yep.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.511
  I'll get the next customer.

07:24.544 --> 07:27.514
  Whoa, baby, did you come
  to have your picture taken?

07:27.547 --> 07:29.516
  Or to go live on
  a deserted island with me?

07:29.549 --> 07:31.484
 That's a cute little fantasy.

07:31.518 --> 07:34.554
Can you tell me
where Samuel Powers is?

07:34.587 --> 07:37.624
  - Checkmate.
  - Never mind, I found him.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.660
Are you Samuel Powers?

07:40.694 --> 07:43.830
  That's what my mom
  writes inside my underwear.

07:44.597 --> 07:46.733
  She wants Screech?

07:46.766 --> 07:49.269
   I'm Allison Fox
   from "Chessboy Magazine,"

07:49.302 --> 07:52.772
   and I'd really like
   to check out your moves.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.675
- You know what I mean?
- Not exactly.

07:58.912 --> 08:01.815
  Wow, I still can't believe
  that "Chessboy Magazine..."

08:01.848 --> 08:05.652
 - ...but why me?
 - That's what I want to know.

08:05.685 --> 08:08.722
 All their scouting reports
 say you're
 a great chess player.

08:08.755 --> 08:11.057
But none of them said
you were this handsome.

08:11.091 --> 08:14.928
 I am considered
 the Kevin Costner
 of the chess circuit.

08:15.895 --> 08:18.598
 Oh, come on,
 I just don't get it.

08:18.631 --> 08:21.101
There are mysteries
you just can't explain.

08:21.134 --> 08:25.805
   Like, why does
   Sinead O'Connor
   have a hairdryer?

08:25.839 --> 08:28.875
 - Be careful,
 that's school property.
 - What's the matter with him?

08:28.908 --> 08:31.578
Some babe
dogged him for Screech.

08:32.145 --> 08:35.048
Wow, that's
an awfully messy locker

08:35.048 --> 08:37.884
   for someone with a mind
   as neat as yours.

08:37.917 --> 08:40.787
  That's because I'm a slob.

08:40.820 --> 08:42.621
Not only are you
brilliant and handsome

08:42.655 --> 08:45.058
 but you have
 a sense of humor too.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.060
   Oh my...

08:48.695 --> 08:50.730
Why don't you let me
take you out to lunch?

08:50.764 --> 08:52.065
 We can do the interview there.

08:52.098 --> 08:54.067
   I'll meet you at
   The Max at noon?

08:54.067 --> 08:56.636
 I'll be looking forward to it.

08:58.438 --> 09:00.407
 Does Violet know about this?

09:00.440 --> 09:02.042
 She will soon enough.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.344
( bell rings )

09:04.377 --> 09:06.179
 Lisa: See you later.

09:19.025 --> 09:21.728
( squeaky voice )
Hi, Vinnie?
Like, it's me, Allison.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.930
   Is Guy-Guy there?

09:24.030 --> 09:25.665
Hi, sweet lips.

09:25.699 --> 09:28.101
 Like, the dweeb
 totally fell for it.

09:28.134 --> 09:30.103
So, like, I'll break up
him and his girlfriend,

09:30.136 --> 09:33.206
   and he'll be way too
   bugged out to play chess.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.842
   I'll see ya
   at the Galleria.

09:36.943 --> 09:38.778
 Bye.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.387
I think of chess
as the great equalizer.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.422
   No matter how big
   or small you are,

09:49.456 --> 09:51.591
  we're all the same size
  on the chessboard.

09:51.624 --> 09:53.526
   You are so deep.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.296
   - Samuel.
   - Oh, hi, Violet.

09:56.663 --> 09:58.398
 Violet: Ahem!

09:58.431 --> 10:01.501
 Aren't you going
 to introduce me
 to your lady friend?

10:01.534 --> 10:05.638
  Sure... Allison,
  meet my
  significant other, Violet.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.374
  How sweet.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.380
 Allison is from
 "Chessboy Magazine."

10:13.413 --> 10:16.416
   They want to do
   an article on me.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.752
 How wonderful.
 It's a pleasure to meet you.

10:18.785 --> 10:22.489
 It's not just an article,
 Screech, we want
 you to be our centerfold.

10:22.522 --> 10:27.060
You mean me?
Checkmate of the Month?

10:27.093 --> 10:28.762
   Kelly: I don't care
   what magazine she's from,

10:28.795 --> 10:31.631
 she's flirting with Screech,
 and right in front of Violet.

10:31.664 --> 10:33.767
   What our readers
   want to know is,

10:33.800 --> 10:37.437
  what makes Screech Powers
  a winner?

10:37.470 --> 10:42.509
   Boy, if I had
   a nickel for every time
   somebody asked me that...

10:42.542 --> 10:45.378
 There is one thing,
 I could never win without...

10:45.412 --> 10:48.348
 Oh, Samuel, you're so sweet.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.583
   - ...my lucky beret.
   - A hat?

10:50.617 --> 10:52.352
 We'd never win a game
 without this.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.854
 Awesome, totally...
 I mean, fascinating.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.790
May I?

10:56.823 --> 10:59.592
  I never wore the hat
  of a genius before.

10:59.626 --> 11:02.295
 No, see, I gave that to Samuel
 and he'd never...

11:02.328 --> 11:04.531
   - Sure.
   - ... let anyone else...

11:06.666 --> 11:10.403
 Screech, we're having
 a pool party at the Chessboy
 mansion on Saturday

11:10.437 --> 11:12.906
 and I'd like you to come
 as my personal guest.

11:12.939 --> 11:15.542
Ha, Samuel can't,
we have plans.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.077
  Violet, did you hear that?

11:17.110 --> 11:20.680
   I get to swim
   in the pawn-shaped pool.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.882
  I'll need a new bathing suit,
  a new towel...

11:22.916 --> 11:25.585
 Gosh, I better pump some iron.

11:25.618 --> 11:28.455
 - Poor Violet.
 - Let's go see if she's okay.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.590
 I'm almost done,
 I'll catch up to you guys.
 Bye.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.525
 ( mumbling )

11:32.559 --> 11:35.462
 Thanks for the interview,
 Screech.
 I must get back to Valley...

11:35.495 --> 11:38.698
 I mean, the Valley,
 to my office.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.834
  Sure, see you at poolside.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.872
  Wait a minute,
  isn't that Screech's beret?

11:45.905 --> 11:47.540
 Oh...

11:47.574 --> 11:49.809
I must have forgotten.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.178
  Hey, Screech,
  be more careful with this.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.781
  I got 300 bucks riding on you
  and your magic hat.

11:54.814 --> 11:55.915
- Right.
- Yeah.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.852
  I better go hide
  this in my locker.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.054
   It's got a false bottom.

12:02.589 --> 12:05.759
 Allison, I've decided
 to give you a second chance.

12:05.792 --> 12:08.628
  - I'm free tonight.
  - I could see why.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.465
Was that a yes or a no?

12:15.769 --> 12:18.805
   Oh, look at her.
   She must be so depressed.

12:18.838 --> 12:21.641
 We're gonna need
 an extra box of
 tissues for this one.

12:21.675 --> 12:25.745
   It's hard to believe
   anybody could be this
   sad over losing Screech.

12:25.779 --> 12:28.548
 I am not sad,
 I'm furious.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.619
Mother warned me
not to go out with him.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.187
  "He'll break your heart,"
  she said.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.723
 - But did I listen? No.
 - Violet, calm down.

12:37.557 --> 12:38.925
  I most certainly will not.

12:38.958 --> 12:42.762
 I have given him
 the best semester of my life.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.497
Violet, relax.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.566
And when I think
of how he treated me...

12:46.599 --> 12:50.236
 Allison this and Allison that.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.840
  It's not Screech's fault,
  not completely.
  It's that reporter.

12:53.873 --> 12:55.875
 Jessie's right, all Screech
 cared about was the article.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.544
 That girl was coming
 on to him.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.846
 And the doofus
 didn't realize it.

13:01.681 --> 13:05.652
  You mean Sammy's not
  interested in her?

13:05.685 --> 13:07.787
( snorts )
Oh golly goose.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.690
I've been such a fool.

13:10.724 --> 13:12.559
  Why don't you go find him
  and make up?

13:12.592 --> 13:15.228
  Oh, I will.
  It's so hard
  not to get jealous

13:15.261 --> 13:18.498
when you're dating
such a high-risk hunk.

13:22.602 --> 13:25.538
   Samuel! I've been
   looking all over for you.

13:25.572 --> 13:28.742
 - Violet, I'm glad to see you.
 - You are?

13:28.775 --> 13:31.778
 I'm not too sure about
 this pool party with Allison.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.080
 Oh-hh really?

13:34.080 --> 13:35.915
 I'm still available.

13:35.949 --> 13:37.784
 I'm still going to the party,

13:37.817 --> 13:41.988
  I just can't
  decide if I should wear
  these, these or...

13:42.088 --> 13:43.690
these.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.960
  ( growls )

13:46.993 --> 13:49.295
   Are you sure these'll
   look good on me?

13:49.329 --> 13:51.631
  Cock-a-doodle-
  beat-bop-ba-dang...

13:51.664 --> 13:53.700
 I'd wear the blue ones
 'cause they match your eyes.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.568
 - Thanks.
 - No problem.

13:55.602 --> 14:00.373
  Squeeze-squat-
  squiddely-doop-bop.

14:00.407 --> 14:03.543
  Hey,
  check out what I'm wearing
  to the Chessboy pool party.

14:03.576 --> 14:06.646
  - There is no party, Screech.
  - No Checkmate of
  the Month either.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.282
  - What are you talking about?
  - You've been rooked,
  look at this.

14:09.315 --> 14:11.851
   "We got the beret,
   so pay up today."

14:13.720 --> 14:15.755
 And Allison's not a reporter.

14:15.789 --> 14:18.758
 - She's a spy from Valley.
 - Why is she
 with Guy-Guy Master?

14:18.792 --> 14:21.928
   - Because she's
   his girlfriend.
   - His girlfriend?

14:21.961 --> 14:23.963
 Look at that,
 she's got the same hat I do.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.799
   It is your hat, Screech.

14:25.832 --> 14:28.068
  It can't be,
  mine's in my locker.
  Come here.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.769
  Screech...

14:30.970 --> 14:32.872
It's in here somewhere.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.076
  Hold that.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.682
  It's gone!

14:42.716 --> 14:45.085
  ( tearfully )
  She stole my beret.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.789
  Now I'll never win.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.728
 ( slurping )

14:57.630 --> 14:59.366
   He looks so sad.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.534
   I just want to go over there
   and give him a big hug.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.604
 Yeah, the poor geek
 lost his favorite accessory.

15:04.637 --> 15:08.041
  - I'd be crushed.
  - We should
  tell him the truth.

15:08.074 --> 15:11.578
  We shouldn't try and fool him
  with a phony beret.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.480
Just trust us.

15:13.513 --> 15:17.717
 Trust you and Zack?
 Those words don't go together.

15:17.751 --> 15:20.420
 It's the only way
 to boost his confidence again.

15:20.453 --> 15:23.390
- Yeah.
I'll see you guys later.
- Bye, guys. Take care.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.824
Later.

15:24.858 --> 15:28.495
   - Both: Hey, Screech.
   - How's it going?

15:28.528 --> 15:31.798
 We were over at Valley
 yesterday and we found
 something interesting.

15:31.831 --> 15:34.601
  We thought you might know
  who it belonged to.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.670
It's my beret.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.872
My beret!
Hooray!

15:38.905 --> 15:41.508
- Go win that
chess tournament.
- Go get 'em, Screech.

15:41.541 --> 15:44.511
  No problem.
  You guys are the greatest.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.680
   I have to go tell Violet.

15:48.415 --> 15:49.849
  You feel like making
  some money, Slater?

15:49.883 --> 15:51.951
- Indubitably.
- Let's do it.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.621
  All right, get your
  Screech berets right here!

15:54.654 --> 15:57.924
   - Get your
   lucky Screech beret.
   - Screech berets.

16:02.495 --> 16:04.397
   Violet,
   you'll never believe it.

16:04.431 --> 16:07.100
  I have to tell
  you about Allison.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.769
  No, I have to tell
  you about Allison.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.838
If that is the kind of
trollop you want, fine,

16:11.871 --> 16:14.607
   but as far as I'm concerned,
   you are a bum.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.676
   - Violet, what's the matter?
   - ( Violet scoffs )

16:16.710 --> 16:19.679
  Like you don't know,
  Mr. Checkmate of the Month.

16:19.713 --> 16:21.648
And where'd you get
the stupid hat?

16:21.681 --> 16:23.383
 You gave it to me, remember?

16:23.416 --> 16:26.152
 No, Samuel, the one I gave you
 had my initials on it.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.621
  This cheap imitation says,

16:28.655 --> 16:31.891
- "Property of
French's Pizza"?
- Are you sure?

16:31.925 --> 16:34.828
 About as sure as I am
 that we are through.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.537
  Hey, my little gold mine,
  how is it going?

16:44.571 --> 16:47.674
  Hey, you must be mighty happy
  to have your hat back.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.477
  Forget it, guys,
  I know it's a fake.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.980
 Face it, you bet on a loser.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.686
  Poor little fella.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.655
 First he loses his lucky beret
 and then he loses his girl.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.656
  Oh, come on.
  What are you
  guys worried about?

17:04.691 --> 17:07.594
  - Screech is still gonna win.
  - How can you be so sure?

17:07.627 --> 17:09.829
We know something
you don't know.

17:11.931 --> 17:13.833
   Hi, Screech.
   We came to wish you luck.

17:13.867 --> 17:18.038
 - Even brought
 my lucky pom-poms.
 - Luck? Ha, I don't need luck.

17:18.070 --> 17:20.040
   - All right.
   - That's the spirit, son.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.575
   I need a miracle.

17:22.608 --> 17:24.678
Belding:
Help him, I don't know.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.681
 Morris, let us dispense
 with the formalities.

17:27.714 --> 17:31.484
   - Pay up now.
   - Like that dog's
   never gonna win.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.753
Well like, we'll just have
to wait and see, o-kay?

17:33.787 --> 17:36.056
O-kay.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.957
   Hey, Peter,
   where you going?

17:38.058 --> 17:40.894
  I go to humiliate your friend
  Screechnavich.

17:40.927 --> 17:45.265
 Hey, Pete, that's great,
 but first you have to get
  a pre-game photo taken.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.067
   - Oh yes?
   - Oh yes.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.302
 It's an American custom,
 that way if you lose,

17:49.336 --> 17:51.905
  they still have a picture
  of you smiling.

17:51.938 --> 17:54.908
   Come on.

17:54.941 --> 17:57.844
  - It's right this way, Peter.
  - Hurry,
  there isn't much time.

17:57.877 --> 18:00.013
 Yep, that's why
 we're "Russian" you.

18:00.046 --> 18:01.915
  Good one, Preppie.

18:03.049 --> 18:04.718
   Slater: Go ahead.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.521
   ( clattering and ruckus )

18:17.630 --> 18:20.100
  Okay, Preppie,
  the coast is clear.

18:24.037 --> 18:26.673
  - Thank you, comrade.
  - No problemovich.

18:26.706 --> 18:29.042
  - Come, let's goski.
  - Okayski.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.652
   What are you doing here?
   Where's Zack?

18:39.686 --> 18:43.723
 He asked me to fill in.
 He said he wasn't
 feeling like himself.

18:44.858 --> 18:46.926
 ( crowd applauding )

18:49.396 --> 18:52.132
   Jessie: Peter Breznev,
   Valley's champ
   has just arrived.

18:52.165 --> 18:54.768
  Slater, who do you think
  will come out on top today?

18:54.801 --> 18:56.736
  Call it a hunch,
  but I think Screech

18:56.770 --> 18:59.239
  is gonna kick
  that commie's butt.

19:03.009 --> 19:05.645
Slater, we're on the air.
In this age of glasnost

19:05.679 --> 19:07.914
   you don't say,
   "Kick the commie's butt."

19:08.014 --> 19:10.116
  Oh, sorry.

19:10.150 --> 19:13.887
  What I meant was,
  kick that commie's heinie.

19:17.057 --> 19:19.759
  Welcome to
  the All-City Chess finals.

19:19.793 --> 19:23.663
In a way it's
more than all-city,
it's all-world.

19:23.697 --> 19:26.633
   And today it's important
   to remember

19:26.666 --> 19:29.669
  that the Russkis
  are our friendskis.

19:29.703 --> 19:32.672
   Good luck, son.
   Perestroika, son.

19:37.143 --> 19:38.912
  Stop your crying,
  stop your fussing;

19:38.945 --> 19:41.748
  come on, Screech,
  beat that Russian.

19:44.217 --> 19:47.854
And they're off.
The Soviet gets
the first move.

19:51.491 --> 19:55.195
   Pawn to King's Rook Two?
   That's pretty
   unorthodox style.

19:55.228 --> 19:58.098
   What style?
   He's never played before.

19:58.131 --> 20:01.701
  I mean, he's never played
  an American before.

20:01.735 --> 20:05.171
  I've never seen that strategy
  in any of the chess books.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.212
   Boy, you're good.

20:12.946 --> 20:15.248
- Beat me.
- Huh?

20:15.281 --> 20:18.518
  - Just win the game.
  - Jaws windy game?

20:18.551 --> 20:20.887
   What's that mean?

20:20.920 --> 20:23.156
 I surrender Screechnavich.
 You're too good.

20:23.189 --> 20:25.258
( Valley crowd groans )

20:27.027 --> 20:29.963
Hey, hey, hey...
what is going on here?

20:29.996 --> 20:33.800
 Incredible, first the Russian
 was winning, then
 the Russian was losing,

20:33.833 --> 20:36.369
  now the Russian's hopping
  on stage in his underwear?

20:36.403 --> 20:38.138
  Quite a game, huh?

20:38.171 --> 20:42.008
   Like, wow, that's not Peter,
   that's a faker.

20:42.042 --> 20:45.211
   Well, let's find out
   who the faker is.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.282
   - Screech: Zack?
   - Ow! Ow!

20:49.315 --> 20:52.352
   Morris,
   you better have an amazing
   explanation for this one.

20:52.385 --> 20:56.289
  I do, sir, we made this
  teeny tiny little
  bet with Valley...

20:56.322 --> 20:59.192
 Right, sir, but you see
 they stole Screech's lucky hat

20:59.225 --> 21:02.395
- so he would lose.
- That's right,
we did it for Bayside.

21:02.429 --> 21:05.131
  Hats, kidnapping, gambling?

21:05.165 --> 21:08.168
  That's it,
  both schools are disqualified
  for unsportsmanlike...

21:08.201 --> 21:10.136
  ( boys protesting )

21:10.170 --> 21:12.105
You can't do that,
these guys were
innocent pawns.

21:12.138 --> 21:15.075
 Honest, Screech and the commie
 didn't know
 anything about this.

21:15.075 --> 21:16.943
 - They didn't?
 - No.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.546
   - I don't know.
   - All right,
   if we called off the bet,

21:19.579 --> 21:22.082
 - would you let them play?
 - ( Peter whimpers )

21:22.082 --> 21:24.084
 All right, but only if
 you call off the bet.

21:24.084 --> 21:25.251
- All right.
- Fine.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.220
   Guys,
   the bet's off, all right?

21:27.253 --> 21:29.322
 - Is everybody happy?
 - ( screams )

21:29.356 --> 21:32.092
Why not?
What more do you want?

21:33.093 --> 21:35.428
 It is cold,
 I want my pants back.

21:37.364 --> 21:40.000
 Wait a minute, the bet's off?

21:40.100 --> 21:42.402
Then you're broke,
I'm outta here.

21:45.205 --> 21:47.440
  ( crowd cheering )

21:47.474 --> 21:48.808
   Hey, hey, hey...

21:48.842 --> 21:52.245
 I still want to
 see you and Slater
 in my office tomorrow morning.

21:52.278 --> 21:54.347
   ( Slater groans )

21:54.381 --> 21:56.016
   Forget it, guys.

21:56.116 --> 21:59.119
 Without my lucky beret,
 I have nothing left.

22:02.055 --> 22:04.324
 - You have me, Samuel.
 - Violet!

22:04.357 --> 22:05.692
I thought you hated me.

22:05.725 --> 22:09.229
 That was before I
 realized you were
 manipulated by powerful forces

22:09.262 --> 22:11.398
and you
couldn't help yourself.

22:11.431 --> 22:14.868
   - I love you, Sammy.
   - I love you too, Violet.

22:18.471 --> 22:21.207
  Now, let's play some chess.

22:33.086 --> 22:34.454
  Checkmate.

22:40.326 --> 22:42.262
 Okay, so I didn't win the bet,
