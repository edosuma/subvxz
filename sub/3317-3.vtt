ANNA LEIGH (DISTANTLY): Fiona.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.223
Fiona!

00:56.723 --> 00:58.308
I thought you had gone
with the other girls

00:58.392 --> 01:00.561
down to Jackson Square to burn your bra.

01:00.811 --> 01:01.812
Why?

01:01.895 --> 01:04.106
So I can gag on the toxic fumes coming off

01:04.189 --> 01:05.858
all that burning Playtex?

01:05.941 --> 01:06.942
No, thanks.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.196
Fiona, you're wicked.

01:11.613 --> 01:13.073
When did you first know
you were destined

01:13.156 --> 01:15.033
to become the next Supreme?

01:17.744 --> 01:19.162
I was just 29 years old

01:19.246 --> 01:22.165
when the reigning Supreme at the time,
MiMi DeLongpre,

01:22.249 --> 01:24.501
called a Council,
and I performed the Seven Wonders

01:24.585 --> 01:27.588
and was unanimously proclaimed
to be the true born heir

01:27.671 --> 01:28.839
of the Supremacy.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.257
I wasn't talking about the Council.

01:30.465 --> 01:32.968
When did you know? In your bones?

01:33.051 --> 01:34.344
Well, I will tell you.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.930
By the time I was your age,
I had already been

01:37.014 --> 01:39.224
manifesting multiple powers.

01:39.474 --> 01:43.478
It's not unusual for a talented witch
to manifest four,

01:44.146 --> 01:47.357
even five innate gifts
once she starts to flower.

01:47.983 --> 01:51.111
But that does not make you the Supreme.

01:51.904 --> 01:54.656
Only the mastery of the Seven Wonders
could prove that.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.116
-So let me prove it.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.245
Even if you are next in line.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.039
I am ready.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.332
And I say you're not.

02:03.415 --> 02:06.710
Because you don't want to be replaced
by me.

02:07.252 --> 02:08.295
Careful, girl.

02:09.171 --> 02:10.756
Don't test my wrath.

02:11.507 --> 02:14.176
They say when a new Supreme
starts to flower,

02:14.259 --> 02:17.054
the old Supreme begins to fade.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.182
You've been fading, Anna Leigh.

02:22.184 --> 02:24.144
Shall I show you my power?

02:24.228 --> 02:25.979
You're weak, Anna Leigh.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.940
We both know why.

I've seen the ruin
you will bring this coven

02:44.706 --> 02:46.542
if you are allowed to take power now.

02:46.625 --> 02:50.337
You're a selfish,
craven little child, Fiona.

02:50.629 --> 02:53.090
And I will make it my mission

02:53.173 --> 02:55.968
to ensure that you will
never take the throne.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.054
I'll see you burn in hell first.

to stretch and tighten the skin.

47:19.381 --> 47:20.924
And I'm dying.

47:21.842 --> 47:23.218
My time is up,

47:25.179 --> 47:26.680
and you're...

47:27.890 --> 47:29.224
...killing me.

47:30.976 --> 47:32.311
Your powers,

47:32.477 --> 47:34.521
you've been feeling them growing?

47:34.605 --> 47:35.898
Yeah, like crazy.

47:35.981 --> 47:39.193
Have you ever wondered why?

47:39.276 --> 47:41.445
Uh, apart from my being awesome?

47:41.528 --> 47:43.155
I'm the source.

47:46.491 --> 47:51.163
My life force is literally
pouring out of my body

47:51.246 --> 47:52.706
and into yours.

47:53.999 --> 47:58.003
This is no mystical mumbo-jumbo.

47:58.086 --> 47:59.379
This is real.

48:03.050 --> 48:04.176
(LAUGHS)

48:04.259 --> 48:05.594
I have cancer.

48:07.429 --> 48:09.389
I won't last the year.

48:10.015 --> 48:11.308
I have connections.

48:11.391 --> 48:14.728
My agent can get the best oncologist
in the country here in a flash.

48:14.811 --> 48:17.231
Chemo? (LAUGHS) Oh.

48:17.314 --> 48:19.441
Oh, no, no.

48:19.525 --> 48:21.443
No, no, no, I'm not going out

48:21.527 --> 48:23.946
bald and shriveled and...

48:26.532 --> 48:28.450
...begging for morphine.

48:31.286 --> 48:35.332
No. I've lived a disreputable life,
but I've done it in style,

48:35.415 --> 48:37.334
and I'll die likewise.

48:39.127 --> 48:40.128
(SCOFFS)

48:49.137 --> 48:51.181
I don't belong on these walls.

48:52.683 --> 48:55.102
I took my inheritance too soon and...

48:55.561 --> 48:57.062
...squandered it.

48:57.479 --> 49:01.108
All that power, all those gifts.

49:03.819 --> 49:08.490
I just took it
and poured it back into myself

49:09.491 --> 49:11.410
and dressed it up in Chanel.

49:17.374 --> 49:19.293
I was a shitty Supreme.

49:23.630 --> 49:24.923
(CHUCKLES)

49:25.257 --> 49:28.510
But, now, my mentor,

49:29.887 --> 49:31.096
Anna Leigh Leighton,

49:32.806 --> 49:34.725
now there was a Supreme.

49:37.728 --> 49:40.856
She was majestic

49:40.939 --> 49:42.065
and powerful.

49:46.570 --> 49:48.488
She taught me everything I know.

49:56.955 --> 49:59.124
You know how I thanked her?

50:03.295 --> 50:04.755
By cutting her throat.

50:05.464 --> 50:06.924
Right where I'm standing.

50:09.092 --> 50:10.511
With this.

50:10.594 --> 50:12.596
I've kept it all these years.

50:14.848 --> 50:16.058
(LAUGHS)

50:20.103 --> 50:21.480
And now I give it to you.

50:21.563 --> 50:22.731
Why? I don't want that.

50:22.814 --> 50:24.566
Yeah. Come on, here.

50:24.650 --> 50:26.151
-No.
-Don't be afraid. Use it.

50:26.235 --> 50:28.278
Kill me for the sake of the coven.

50:28.362 --> 50:30.197
-No.
-Yes. Come on.

50:30.697 --> 50:32.157
Don't be afraid. Do it!

50:32.533 --> 50:34.576
-Come on, now, do it!
-I can't!

50:34.660 --> 50:36.870
-No!
-Yes, you can, you stupid girl!

50:36.954 --> 50:38.247
-No!
-Do it!

50:38.330 --> 50:40.040
And feel my power flow into you!

50:40.123 --> 50:43.335
I know, because I was standing
where you're standing!

50:43.418 --> 50:44.795
Stop yelling at me!

50:44.878 --> 50:46.547
-Do it! Do it!
-No!

50:46.630 --> 50:48.715
Do it! (GASPS)

50:48.924 --> 50:50.175
(GASPS)

50:51.802 --> 50:53.178
-No.
-(CRIES)

50:53.595 --> 50:54.972
(GASPING)

51:25.085 --> 51:26.336
(SIGHS)

51:34.261 --> 51:35.637
Bury her deep.

51:36.513 --> 51:38.640
God knows what all that shit

51:38.724 --> 51:41.476
in her body will do to the lawn

51:41.560 --> 51:43.228
when it comes up in the spring.

52:04.499 --> 52:07.211
This coven doesn't need a new Supreme.

52:08.504 --> 52:10.506
Needs a new rug.
