21:33.960 --> 21:36.060
Just as soon as we can.

21:36.062 --> 21:37.928
Bye-bye.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.597
Woman is driving me crazy.

21:39.599 --> 21:42.166
What are you so upset for?
She wants her car back.

21:42.168 --> 21:43.934
I'm not upset about that.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.936
I'm upset that
you ran out of business cards

21:45.938 --> 21:47.338
And I had to give her
one of <i>mine.</i>

21:47.340 --> 21:49.974
...As they have in ours.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.342
Ahmed: My client's name
is juan diaz.

21:51.344 --> 21:53.978
He steals cars,
delivers them to a chop shop,

21:53.980 --> 21:55.479
And helps strip the vehicles
of whatever is valuable.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.615
You were there this morning,
mr. Diaz?

21:57.617 --> 22:01.152
At the chop shop?
Sí. Yes.

22:01.154 --> 22:03.954
I work in the pit.

22:03.956 --> 22:08.359
This morning, I-I-I did what
we all do -- I stole a car.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.628
This one
from outside a starbucks,

22:10.630 --> 22:12.263
And then
I drove it to work.

22:12.265 --> 22:13.631
I parked
it down the street

22:13.633 --> 22:16.200
To make sure
that I wasn't being followed.

22:16.202 --> 22:19.337
Then I...
I went inside

22:19.339 --> 22:22.039
To take apart what was already
in the garage -- the taurus.

22:22.041 --> 22:24.208
I was standing in the pit
when --

22:24.210 --> 22:25.609
When I heard some --
some yelling and --

22:25.611 --> 22:26.711
And -- and screaming.

22:26.713 --> 22:28.145
They were fighting.

22:28.147 --> 22:30.147
Did you recognize
the voice?

22:30.149 --> 22:31.449
No. No.

22:31.451 --> 22:32.717
So, what did you do
after the yelling?

22:32.719 --> 22:34.952
I started to climb out,

22:34.954 --> 22:38.089
And then -- and then somebody
just fell on top of me,

22:38.091 --> 22:39.323
Bleeding everywhere.

22:39.325 --> 22:42.159
And then -- and then
another body fell in,

22:42.161 --> 22:44.161
And -- and --
and another body.

22:44.163 --> 22:47.064
And I...
I hid underneath them.

22:47.066 --> 22:50.101
What were their names?
What?

22:50.103 --> 22:53.404
What were the names of the men
who fell on top of your client?

22:53.406 --> 22:56.407
<i>You work with them, juan.</i>
<i>What were their names?</i>

22:56.409 --> 22:58.509
I don't know
their real names.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.144
Okay,
we weren't friends!

23:00.146 --> 23:02.980
I didn't ask who they were,
they didn't ask about me.

23:02.982 --> 23:04.148
All I know is these guys
were bleeding

23:04.150 --> 23:05.516
When they were
thrown on top of me.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.418
And if I wouldn't have hid,
I would be dead, too.

23:07.420 --> 23:09.186
So you stayed in the pit
until...?

23:09.188 --> 23:12.390
Until I felt
it was safe.

23:14.359 --> 23:15.626
[ voice breaking ]
I looked around to make sure

23:15.628 --> 23:18.763
That no one was alive,
and I climbed out

23:18.765 --> 23:22.099
And -- and got into the car
we were taking apart

23:22.101 --> 23:24.068
And -- and drove away.

23:28.106 --> 23:29.774
Why did you run
from the police

23:29.776 --> 23:32.376
When you knew there were
bodies in the garage?

23:35.180 --> 23:36.781
I'm sorry.

23:38.583 --> 23:39.617
I'm sorry.

23:39.619 --> 23:42.186
Do you understand

23:42.188 --> 23:43.687
How horrific
these circumstances were?

23:43.689 --> 23:45.423
Juan was afraid.

23:45.425 --> 23:48.058
He was covered in blood
in a stolen car,

23:48.060 --> 23:49.760
In the country illegally.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.797
Look -- he's already
been through hell.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.331
He committed
no serious crime,

23:54.333 --> 23:56.367
And he is more than willing
to self-deport.

23:58.170 --> 24:01.238
[ crying ]
I just want to go back home.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.107
Please.

24:03.109 --> 24:07.378
I want to go back home.

24:11.550 --> 24:13.117
[ door closes ]

24:13.119 --> 24:14.685
I've heard
nothing inconsistent

24:14.687 --> 24:16.120
From the evidence
we found at the crime scene.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.354
As far as I can tell,

24:17.356 --> 24:19.156
Your suspect
is not only a victim,

24:19.158 --> 24:21.358
But a witness --
to a triple homicide.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.594
And he might be
seriously traumatized.

24:23.596 --> 24:25.663
When we pulled him over,
he looked okay to me.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.398
Well, he could be
suffering from shock.

24:27.400 --> 24:28.799
His explanation
covers what we know.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.302
Okay, what about something
that juan doesn't know?

24:31.304 --> 24:32.736
Like the names
of the three victims.

24:32.738 --> 24:34.705
And why did he drive off
in a taurus

24:34.707 --> 24:36.173
If he had
a range rover outside?

24:36.175 --> 24:37.541
Why was he working
with gangbangers

24:37.543 --> 24:39.610
Dressed up like
he was going to beverly hills?

24:39.612 --> 24:41.612
This story, ma'am,
is not credible.

24:41.614 --> 24:44.548
But the identity
of at least one of the victims

24:44.550 --> 24:47.218
Does mesh with
this version of events.

24:47.220 --> 24:49.520
Pepito garza stole drug
shipments from several gangs.

24:49.522 --> 24:51.522
He had a death wish.

24:51.524 --> 24:53.123
Maybe one of the cartels
is involved.

24:53.125 --> 24:55.259
Okay, what was pepito doing
in a chop shop?

24:55.261 --> 24:58.529
Okay, I'll tell you,
this <i>juan</i> is involved in drugs.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.231
Then find me some evidence
to prove it.

25:00.233 --> 25:01.465
Or find me the killer.

25:01.467 --> 25:02.633
And maybe we can
get your bloody friend

25:02.635 --> 25:03.801
Some protection
as a witness.

25:03.803 --> 25:05.436
Might want to hold off
on that.

25:05.438 --> 25:07.204
Your suspect may not
have a record in the u.S.,

25:07.206 --> 25:08.405
But he's got one
in mexico.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.274
Manuel luis vega aguilar.

25:10.276 --> 25:12.576
His name's not juan.

25:12.578 --> 25:14.879
Manuel luis.
He's a liar.

25:14.881 --> 25:16.447
And he's wanted
for drug racketeering.

25:16.449 --> 25:18.516
His prints set off alarms
with the federales.

25:18.518 --> 25:20.384
Mexico has an arrest warrant
out for him.

25:20.386 --> 25:21.619
And they're asking
for him back, asap.

25:21.621 --> 25:23.454
Yeah,
he offered to self-deport.

25:23.456 --> 25:25.222
He wants to go home
because he's cartel

25:25.224 --> 25:26.557
And he can
bribe himself out.

25:26.559 --> 25:29.860
Manuel luis <i>vega</i> aguilar.

25:30.896 --> 25:33.297
Vega.

25:33.299 --> 25:35.666
What am I missing?
In latin countries,

25:35.668 --> 25:38.469
Children retain the last names
of both their parents.

25:38.471 --> 25:40.871
His father's last name
is aguilar

25:40.873 --> 25:43.874
And his mother's
last name is vega.
It was her taurus
he was driving.

25:43.876 --> 25:47.611
And mrs. Vega is <i>very</i> interested
in getting that taurus back.

25:47.613 --> 25:49.313
She's called me
five times already.

25:49.315 --> 25:50.648
If julio is right...
I am.

25:50.650 --> 25:53.517
...And our suspect
is cartel...
He is.

25:53.519 --> 25:54.919
...Then instead of
just printing the taurus,

25:54.921 --> 25:56.554
We need to
completely take it apart.

25:58.156 --> 26:00.558
Why?
What are you looking for?

26:00.560 --> 26:02.259
Tao: Black tar heroin.

26:02.261 --> 26:03.527
And a lot of it.

26:03.529 --> 26:05.763
Probably close to
$3 million worth.

26:05.765 --> 26:08.899
Hollowing out the dashboard.
The show could use that.

26:10.268 --> 26:12.937
But doesn't border patrol
check for things like this

26:12.939 --> 26:15.639
With drug dogs
and electronic sniffers?

26:15.641 --> 26:16.941
Well,
with the amount of cars

26:16.943 --> 26:18.242
Coming in and out of mexico
each day,

26:18.244 --> 26:19.510
Not every one
can be checked.

26:20.679 --> 26:23.213
This is
an inconspicuous vehicle.

26:23.215 --> 26:26.917
It's mostly large cars,
s.U.V.S, and vans

26:26.919 --> 26:28.419
That are pulled aside
and searched.

26:28.421 --> 26:30.187
And these dryer sheets
wrapped up in the heroin

26:30.189 --> 26:31.288
Disguise the smell.

26:31.290 --> 26:32.623
It's not 100%.

get in the car, it works.

to get your vehicle back to you.

Oh. You don't know
how worried I was.

Do you know if anything
got stolen out of it?

27:03.823 --> 27:06.357

of that than us, ma'am.

It's all about
how important you are.

29:35.474 --> 29:37.875
I don't want to be
the subject of an essay

29:37.877 --> 29:39.643
That someone else
helped you write.

29:39.645 --> 29:41.912

I did not cheat.

29:46.852 --> 29:48.719

Jason only helped me

29:49.955 --> 29:51.054
With the organization
and the wording.

29:51.056 --> 29:52.456
Well,
we'll ask your teacher

29:52.458 --> 29:54.725
If that qualifies
as your story

29:54.727 --> 29:56.693
And I'll go
with her decision.

29:56.695 --> 29:59.029
And secondly, you have to be
the biggest influence, sharon,

29:59.031 --> 30:00.931
Because if I say
I'm the biggest influence,

30:00.933 --> 30:02.933
Then everyone tells me
I'm a huge egomaniac.

30:02.935 --> 30:04.201
Which we know
is not true.

30:05.670 --> 30:07.638
And I live with you.

So,
you're the influence.

But why do you live
with me, rusty?

30:10.876 --> 30:14.511
That's the question
you need to ask.

30:14.513 --> 30:17.047

30:17.049 --> 30:19.650
Is that I have to
write this essay all over again.

30:19.652 --> 30:20.784
You do.

30:20.786 --> 30:22.653
But think about this,

30:22.655 --> 30:29.660
Influences can be both bad
and good at the same time.

30:36.968 --> 30:40.804
My son's an idiot.
And that's the truth.

30:40.806 --> 30:45.042
He's not smart enough to
smuggle drugs past you people.

30:45.044 --> 30:46.076
Well, we're not so sure
about that

30:46.078 --> 30:47.544
Because your little taurus

30:47.546 --> 30:49.446
Seemed to be
pretty well-designed.

30:49.448 --> 30:52.583
Enough so that it could carry
$3 million worth of heroin

30:52.585 --> 30:54.017
Across the border.

30:54.019 --> 30:57.487
If he did that,

How could she know that?

31:08.567 --> 31:09.833
The suspect had no phone
when you found him.

31:09.835 --> 31:12.536
He must have tossed it
during the chase.

31:12.538 --> 31:13.804
I'll find it.
Okay.

31:14.572 --> 31:15.939
Why is that important?

31:15.941 --> 31:18.575
It means our suspect was
in contact with his mother

31:18.577 --> 31:20.010
After her car
was stolen.

31:20.012 --> 31:22.479

Provenza: [ chuckles ]
well, that's curious,

31:37.730 --> 31:41.198
Because you knew
exactly where to look for it.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.667
It wasn't heroin
that I pulled out of my car.

31:43.669 --> 31:46.570
It was molding clay
that you put there.

31:46.572 --> 31:50.040
I was never in possession
of any illegal drugs.

31:50.042 --> 31:51.575
You can't arrest me
for that.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.143
You sound like
an attorney.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.579

<i>In mexico.</i>

<i>your laws, too,</i>

31:58.050 --> 32:02.286
Which is how I know that you
have nothing to charge me with.

32:02.288 --> 32:05.756
But we have plenty
against your son.

32:05.758 --> 32:08.558
He murdered three people
in a chop shop.

32:08.560 --> 32:11.228
I don't believe you.
He didn't do that.

32:11.230 --> 32:12.562
Why would he do that?

32:12.564 --> 32:14.097
Trying to get
your drugs back.

32:14.099 --> 32:16.700
Trying to get my <i>car</i> back,
you mean.

32:16.702 --> 32:18.969
And if that's true,

32:18.971 --> 32:21.104
Manuel had every right
to kill those people.

32:21.106 --> 32:24.608
<i>And what makes you</i>
<i>think that?</i>

32:24.610 --> 32:28.278
If he was fighting
to regain his own property,

32:28.280 --> 32:31.248
It's not murder.

32:31.250 --> 32:32.816
Ahmed: It's self-defense.

32:32.818 --> 32:34.818
My client had a right
to pursue his mother's car.

32:34.820 --> 32:37.754
He wasn't going after the car,
he was going after his heroin.

32:37.756 --> 32:39.222
The law
doesn't distinguish

32:39.224 --> 32:40.824
Between legal
and illegal property.

32:40.826 --> 32:42.960
Anything manuel did
fighting to get his car back

32:42.962 --> 32:44.061

self-defense.

32:44.063 --> 32:45.562
Hobbs:
It wasn't his car.

32:45.564 --> 32:46.830
It was registered
under his mother's name.

32:46.832 --> 32:48.265
A distinction
without a difference.

32:48.267 --> 32:50.567
He was driving the taurus
with rosa vega's permission.

32:50.569 --> 32:54.338
If the thieves fought him when
he tried to get his car back --

32:54.340 --> 32:56.206
And you have no evidence
to the contrary --

32:56.208 --> 32:59.142
That makes all three of these
deaths justifiable homicides.

32:59.144 --> 33:00.744
Is that for real?

33:00.746 --> 33:02.946
As much as
I hate to say so, yes.

33:02.948 --> 33:05.816

the chop shop tried to stop him,

If you can prove
they belonged to him,

33:12.024 --> 33:14.057
Yes, captain,
he's allowed to fight back,

33:14.059 --> 33:16.760
His property
is his property.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.128
Even if it's contraband.

33:18.130 --> 33:21.598
So, we'll plead guilty
to borrowing a range rover

33:21.600 --> 33:22.933
And call it a day.

33:24.268 --> 33:27.838
Ahmed, it's three counts
of second-degree murder.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.606
That's the best
it's ever gonna get.

33:29.608 --> 33:30.974

has a clock on it.

33:30.976 --> 33:32.376
You want to talk
about clocks?

33:32.378 --> 33:35.779
By my calculations,
you have less than 24 hours

33:35.781 --> 33:36.980
Till habeas corpus
kicks in.

33:36.982 --> 33:38.715
I'm ready
for arraignment right now.

33:53.064 --> 33:56.333
Drug possession?
And illegally "borrowing" a car?

33:56.335 --> 33:58.068
Ahmed was right.

33:58.070 --> 34:00.871
If manuel protected himself
trying to take back the taurus,

34:00.873 --> 34:02.272
That's self-defense.

34:02.274 --> 34:05.675
And with manuel's mother
corroborating his story,

34:05.677 --> 34:06.977
We can't even hold her
much longer.

34:06.979 --> 34:08.779
Jason: Well, you could have,
if you had put

34:08.781 --> 34:10.080
The heroin back in the car
instead of the clay.

34:10.082 --> 34:11.314
Tao: That would
have been illegal.

34:11.316 --> 34:13.650
We're not allowed
to monkey around

34:19.758 --> 34:22.092
With our newest candidate
for mother of the year?

34:22.094 --> 34:24.895
Mrs. Vega seems to be
the brains of this outfit.

34:24.897 --> 34:27.397
I wonder if the federales
are interested in <i>her.</i>

34:27.399 --> 34:29.199
I thought you guys were
worried that if we sent them

34:29.201 --> 34:31.101
Back to mexico the cartel would
bribe your suspect out of jail.

34:31.103 --> 34:33.070
He wanted to self-deport.

34:33.072 --> 34:34.938
That was before
we found the heroin.

34:34.940 --> 34:37.307
Manuel thought that we would
give the car back to his mother.

34:37.309 --> 34:39.109
Now we've got the drugs,
they don't.

34:39.111 --> 34:43.280
Mother and son may prefer
to avoid their cartel friends.
