JACQUl: Debbie Webb's career
as a copper had run off the rails.

15:06.560 --> 15:08.640
She didn't ask to be a whistleblower.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.280
It happened by accident,

15:10.280 --> 15:13.400
all because she had an acute sense
of right and wrong

15:13.400 --> 15:17.240
and was "silly enough to speak up",
as she put it.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.720
But it takes enormous guts
to put your hand up

15:19.720 --> 15:22.553

is sitting on theirs.

15:24.720 --> 15:27.560
Debbie and another whistleblower,
Sergeant Mick Drury,

15:27.560 --> 15:29.320
ran Operation Wave...

15:29.320 --> 15:31.560
an initiative to tackle car theft

15:31.560 --> 15:34.560
dreamed up by
the police minister himself.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.600
Morning, comrade. Late one?

15:36.600 --> 15:40.560
Technically it hasn't finished yet,
so the answer's no.

be at home working on your book.

15:43.680 --> 15:46.440
Oh, we're expecting a visit
from the police minister.

15:46.440 --> 15:47.873
Today?

15:49.880 --> 15:52.440
Fuck me. I better
get cleaned up. Shit!

15:53.680 --> 15:55.760
JACQUl: The police minister
was in the wrong job.

15:55.760 --> 15:59.240
What he really wanted was a uniform,
a gun and a set of handcuffs.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.360
Minister, allow me
to present to you

16:01.360 --> 16:03.320
the man that's actually
running Operation Wave.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.800
This is Detective Sergeant
Michael Drury.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.280

16:07.280 --> 16:10.920
Car thieves are the scourge
of our society in my view.

16:10.920 --> 16:14.440
That's why I came up with the idea
of these special doctored cars.

became known as Gotcha Cars.

Andy Little. Bobby Flood.

40:39.160 --> 40:41.560
Webb. That's what she said,
didn't she, Andy?

40:41.560 --> 40:43.835
We know that name, Bobby.

40:45.440 --> 40:48.720
Look, if you've got any problems,
say it to my face.

40:48.720 --> 40:51.314
We will. Don't worry.

40:58.280 --> 41:00.080
(KNOCKS AT DOOR)

41:00.080 --> 41:03.600
Sir. Detective Senior Constable
Debbie Webb reporting for duty.

41:03.600 --> 41:06.240
Welcome aboard, Debbie.

41:06.240 --> 41:09.000
I'm, uh, new here myself

41:09.000 --> 41:12.549
so we'll have to look out
for each other, won't we? (CHUCKLES)

41:22.920 --> 41:24.478
Eyes front.

41:26.680 --> 41:28.910
Don't you ever wonder, like...

41:30.360 --> 41:32.240
...why we're here?

41:32.240 --> 41:34.320
Uh, not really.

41:34.320 --> 41:37.720
So the Samoan guy,
he ripped the door off the jeep

41:37.720 --> 41:40.960
and he said, "When it gets hot,
I just wind the window down."

41:40.960 --> 41:44.320
(LAUGHS) Steve, you should be,
like, in show business.

41:44.320 --> 41:46.834
SONG: # I would dance for a dollar

41:48.640 --> 41:51.279
# I would swing on a pole

41:53.480 --> 41:56.836
# I would dance on your table

41:58.320 --> 42:01.357
# I'd bend over for you

42:07.760 --> 42:11.070
# If you want me to shake it

42:12.840 --> 42:17.360
# Better part with that money, honey

42:17.360 --> 42:21.035
# It's those dancing dollars

42:22.520 --> 42:25.239
# That speak volumes to me... #

42:27.480 --> 42:31.268
JACQUl: A uniform can only provide
so much protection.

42:34.880 --> 42:37.400
It can't dictate your destiny.

42:37.400 --> 42:40.040
In the end, the only thing
that really matters

42:40.040 --> 42:42.838
is the strength of the woman inside.

42:49.080 --> 42:50.877
SONG: # It's a jungle out there

42:59.480 --> 43:01.277
# It's a jungle out there

43:35.920 --> 43:38.150
# It's a jungle out there. #

43:39.305 --> 43:45.403
