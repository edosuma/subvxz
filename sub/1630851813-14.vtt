WEBVTT

00:09.966 --> 00:11.707
<i>Okay.</i>

00:12.708 --> 00:14.449
Order's up.

00:14.492 --> 00:15.711
- Thank you, Dad.
- Thank you.

00:15.754 --> 00:17.539
You're welcome.

00:17.582 --> 00:19.106
Okay, let's get back to work.

00:19.149 --> 00:21.630
So, I have South Lamar
and Mueller.

00:21.673 --> 00:23.893
Where else do we want to look
to find our new dream home?

00:27.157 --> 00:29.246
- What?
- Sorry. It's weird

00:29.290 --> 00:31.379
to think about our next house
when we just moved out

00:31.422 --> 00:32.858
of our "ancestral family home."

00:32.902 --> 00:34.730
Well, hey, why don't we
turn that around?

00:34.773 --> 00:37.515
You know,
turn a negative into a positive.

00:37.559 --> 00:40.605
Make lemonade
out of lemons. Yeah?

00:40.649 --> 00:42.955
I mean, when Mawline and Gramps
refashioned the farmhouse,

00:42.999 --> 00:44.609
they weren't thinking,

00:44.653 --> 00:46.220
"These teenagers need
separate bathrooms," right?

00:46.263 --> 00:47.786
So, this is a wish list.

00:47.830 --> 00:49.092
Just tell me
your hearts' desires,

00:49.136 --> 00:50.789
and I will write it down.

00:50.833 --> 00:52.269
We're not gonna be
in a rental forever.

00:52.313 --> 00:53.879
Hey, team.

00:53.923 --> 00:55.403
Ger.

00:55.446 --> 00:57.535
- How's everyone doing?
- Great.

00:57.579 --> 01:00.103
Well, I mean, besides
the Davidsons taking our house.

01:00.147 --> 01:02.149
Right.

01:03.585 --> 01:05.282
That-- I didn't mean that
towards, like, you.

01:05.326 --> 01:08.329
Oh, okay, so that's out.

01:09.504 --> 01:10.635
Cool.

01:12.028 --> 01:14.117
So I share a little DNA

01:14.161 --> 01:15.814
with the Davidsons.

01:15.858 --> 01:18.861
Family is about more than
where you come from.

01:18.904 --> 01:21.429
- Mm-hmm.
- It's who sticks by you, right?

01:21.472 --> 01:23.735
- Yeah, we got you.
- I know you do.

01:23.779 --> 01:27.217
Hey, I'm gonna borrow your dad
for a minute. Is that okay?

01:27.261 --> 01:28.784
Of course.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.660
Geri, hey, hey.

01:35.704 --> 01:38.402
I-I should've talked with
you before I told them.

01:38.446 --> 01:40.274
I know that.
I'm sorry.

01:40.317 --> 01:42.189
I mean, we were talking about
my daddy's release from jail,

01:42.232 --> 01:44.930
and it all just
- kind of came out.
- Hey, I get it, I get it.

01:44.974 --> 01:48.020
Uh, there's something
that I have to share with you.

01:48.064 --> 01:50.327
Okay.
I...

01:50.371 --> 01:52.895
had a visit with Gale.

01:52.938 --> 01:54.592
Really?
Yeah.

01:54.636 --> 01:57.465
Okay. Uh... Okay. Wow.

01:57.508 --> 01:59.423
Uh, h-how-how did that go?

01:59.467 --> 02:02.209
I mean, she-she cried
when she saw me.

02:02.252 --> 02:04.950
It seemed like she was more
interested in getting to know me

02:04.994 --> 02:06.604
than talking about
the past, so...

02:06.648 --> 02:09.172
- that's... something.
- Yeah.

02:09.216 --> 02:12.915
Yeah. She is an odd duck.
That's for sure.

02:12.958 --> 02:16.310
Yeah, well, I for one

02:16.353 --> 02:18.486
could see how it would
be hard to find out

02:18.529 --> 02:20.227
that the husband
you grieved for,

02:20.270 --> 02:22.490
what, 20-something years...Yeah.

02:22.533 --> 02:24.535
...actually gave your baby away.

02:24.579 --> 02:27.277
I mean, I'd probably focus
on the good news, too, but...

02:27.321 --> 02:29.410
Of course. Ger,
I only wanted to prove

02:29.453 --> 02:31.020
my dad's innocence.

02:31.063 --> 02:33.327
I had no idea
what we'd dig up.
I-I know.

02:33.370 --> 02:35.024
How much
it would cost.

02:35.067 --> 02:37.635
- No one could've guessed.
- No.

02:37.679 --> 02:40.160
Let's not talk about this.
My brain is tired.
No.

02:40.203 --> 02:42.466
We're all... It's...Of course, of course. Yeah.

02:42.510 --> 02:44.207
Hey, how about this?

02:44.251 --> 02:46.253
Uh, we are all
going to that fair

02:46.296 --> 02:48.037
the Rangers
are holding.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.212
Want to go,
me and you?

02:49.256 --> 02:50.735
I hear Kansas is playing.

02:50.779 --> 02:52.215
Kansas?
Mm-hmm.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.696
"Dust in the Wind,"
Kansas?
Yes, ma'am.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.524
I'm in.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.615
Wait. That's the...

03:00.658 --> 03:03.792
That's the song you go to?

03:03.835 --> 03:05.359
Hmm.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.234
Well, it must be
in storage.

03:11.278 --> 03:14.150
It's fine. We can just pick up
a new one on the way.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.631
That was my go-to bag.
You could fit everything in it,

03:16.674 --> 03:18.459
and it was insulated.

03:18.502 --> 03:21.592
Oh, after everything we've
weathered these past few weeks,

03:21.636 --> 03:23.594
a tote bag's gonna be
what breaks you?

03:23.638 --> 03:25.205
Yes.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.250
What am I gonna
hold my drinks in?

03:27.294 --> 03:30.035
We'll find you something.

03:30.079 --> 03:31.733
Oh, hey.

03:31.776 --> 03:33.517
Cordi just texted me
he's with Geri,

03:33.561 --> 03:35.824
so we should pack
an extra sandwich.

03:35.867 --> 03:39.480
Okay, well...
means I have to find something

03:39.523 --> 03:41.482
even bigger
to put everything in.

03:41.525 --> 03:43.223
You know,
you're gonna have to talk

03:43.266 --> 03:44.441
to Geraldine
about this eventually.

03:44.485 --> 03:47.009
It seems like
a good opportunity.

03:47.052 --> 03:49.316
Yeah. Mama, you couldn't
have known that the kid

03:49.359 --> 03:52.536
Marv was talking about
all those years ago was Geri.

03:52.580 --> 03:55.060
Don't beat yourself up
for that man's mistake.

03:55.104 --> 03:57.411
Giving your child away
like that,

03:57.454 --> 03:59.978
he didn't deserve
to be any kind of father.

04:00.022 --> 04:04.069
Well, maybe if I explain
the timing of everything to her.

04:04.113 --> 04:06.550
Look what I found.

04:07.856 --> 04:09.249
Huh, look at that.

04:09.292 --> 04:11.076
Looks promising,
right?
Oh, look!

04:11.120 --> 04:13.253
I found this
with Cordi's stuff.

04:14.036 --> 04:15.167
Ugh!
No!

04:15.211 --> 04:18.127
My Lord,
what kind of heathens...

04:20.477 --> 04:23.001
That's it,
we're eating at the fair.

04:24.612 --> 04:25.961
Close it.

04:26.004 --> 04:28.180
- We're not taking that.
- Throw it away.

04:28.224 --> 04:29.747
It was worth a shot.

04:31.532 --> 04:34.274
Welcome to the Annual
Ranger Community Fair!

04:34.317 --> 04:36.450
You've really never been
to one of these, huh?

04:36.493 --> 04:38.452
Well, I mean,
a carnival, yes,

04:38.495 --> 04:42.238
but never the Annual
Ranger Community Fair.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.067
Vaguely remember someone
in Dallas talking about it.

04:46.808 --> 04:48.810
Wonder who'll be here
this year.

04:48.853 --> 04:51.726
Didn't exactly leave there
on the best of terms.

04:51.769 --> 04:54.250
You know, Captain
really botched the case

04:54.294 --> 04:56.252
on my partner's
disappearance.

05:03.215 --> 05:04.782
Would've been cool
if I made it, though.

05:04.826 --> 05:06.784
Would've been, yeah.

05:06.828 --> 05:08.308
- Probably rigged.
- Eh.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.310
Hey, anybody from Dallas
gives you crap today,

05:10.353 --> 05:12.050
you come find me, all right?

05:13.313 --> 05:15.837
Yeah, it's definitely rigged.

05:18.579 --> 05:21.059
And we have a winner!

05:21.103 --> 05:22.670
- Yeah!
- Let's go, baby!

05:22.713 --> 05:25.150
Hey, come say hi to a buddy
of mine real quick.

05:25.194 --> 05:27.022
Yeah.

05:29.285 --> 05:30.982
Thank you. Thank you.

05:32.462 --> 05:33.768
Hey.

05:33.811 --> 05:35.030
My man.

05:35.073 --> 05:36.379
Didn't know
you'd be here today.

05:36.423 --> 05:37.902
Come on, now,
I'm not gonna miss out

05:37.946 --> 05:39.817
on an opportunity
for deep-fried cookies.

05:39.861 --> 05:42.298
Like you eat fair food.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.821
And with that,

05:43.865 --> 05:47.564
I guess this is my opportunity
to introduce you.

05:47.608 --> 05:49.218
Trey Barnett,
Cassie Perez.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.133
New Ranger.
I just...

05:51.176 --> 05:53.135
brought her on
to, uh...

05:53.178 --> 05:55.180
keep an eye
on Walker, actually.

05:55.224 --> 05:58.140
- So... new partner?
- New partner, yeah.

05:59.837 --> 06:01.883
Huh. Well, uh,

06:01.926 --> 06:03.885
Cassie, tell me
about yourself. Um...

06:03.928 --> 06:05.626
How's Austin treating you?

06:05.669 --> 06:08.237
Okay, what is with this
eye convo you two are having,

06:08.280 --> 06:10.021
and can I get
a quick translation?

06:10.065 --> 06:12.023
Nah, we just...

06:12.067 --> 06:13.721
We-we... I mean, I was...

06:16.376 --> 06:17.594
Oh, no.

06:17.638 --> 06:19.117
You all right?

06:19.161 --> 06:21.903
Yes, sir. Just spotted
trouble from Dallas.

06:25.733 --> 06:27.517
Ah.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.966
Captain Fenton Cole.
How's it going, man?

06:42.010 --> 06:44.665
- Doing great.
- Haven't seen you since
the division heads meeting.

06:44.708 --> 06:45.883
Dallas keeping you busy?

06:45.927 --> 06:48.190
Oh, yeah.
Glad I could make it down.

06:48.233 --> 06:50.192
- Hey. Trey Barnett.
- Pleasure.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.325
Well, I thought
I heard something

06:53.369 --> 06:54.892
about you
clocking back in.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.024
Austin, huh?

06:57.373 --> 07:00.507
And a real team player.
Work event on your day off.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.639
Well, I'm happy to be
a team player

07:02.683 --> 07:04.336
when I trust the team
I'm playing for.

07:07.905 --> 07:09.907
Hey. Got our kettle corn.

07:13.215 --> 07:15.696
Cassie. Hi.

07:15.739 --> 07:17.567
Rita?
I...

07:17.611 --> 07:19.787
haven't heard from you
since you left Dallas.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.223
Yeah. Sorry about that.

07:21.266 --> 07:22.877
I, um...

07:22.920 --> 07:25.140
didn't have any new leads
to report on your husband's case

07:25.183 --> 07:26.707
after that.

07:28.012 --> 07:30.624
Miles's case is closed, Cassie.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.016
And without good reason.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.105
If you declassified
the file,

07:34.149 --> 07:35.629
maybe I could actually get
a decent lead.

07:35.672 --> 07:38.327
Well, that's a conflict
of interest.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.111
All right, just take it easy,
Perez, okay?

07:41.199 --> 07:43.550
So how's our girl Sachi doing?

07:43.593 --> 07:45.073
Doing okay with school?

07:45.116 --> 07:46.814
As well as can be expected.

07:46.857 --> 07:49.773
She actually asked
about you last week.

07:49.817 --> 07:51.471
Oh. I miss her.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.124
Miss the whole family.

07:53.168 --> 07:56.867
So, uh, how long have
you two been together, hmm?

07:59.043 --> 08:01.002
What? What is with the looks?

08:01.045 --> 08:02.656
Everyone, with the looks
around here.

08:02.699 --> 08:04.614
A little bit now.

08:04.658 --> 08:07.051
Miles has only been missing
for six months.

08:07.095 --> 08:08.966
What is he supposed to think
when he comes back?

08:09.010 --> 08:10.402
He's not coming back.

08:12.709 --> 08:15.843
I'm sorry. The Rangers did
an official investigation.

08:17.018 --> 08:18.933
Okay, we're gonna
make the rounds.

08:18.976 --> 08:20.543
Say hey to some people.

08:20.587 --> 08:21.849
Captain.

08:21.892 --> 08:23.720
- Great to see you.
- Great to see you.

08:25.113 --> 08:26.070
Nice to meet you.

08:26.114 --> 08:27.550
Good to meet you.

08:27.594 --> 08:28.899
Perez?

08:28.943 --> 08:30.945
Clearly there's some, uh,
history there.

08:30.988 --> 08:33.077
Yeah.
Yeah.

08:33.121 --> 08:34.557
Perez, where you going?

08:34.601 --> 08:37.255
I've got to make a few calls
and find Walker.

08:40.389 --> 08:41.956
Thank you, thank you.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.479
- Stel, there.
- Thank you.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.176
Augie, hey.
Here are your tickets.

08:45.220 --> 08:46.569
- Thank you.
- Hey, meet back
at the concert hall

08:46.613 --> 08:47.875
half an hour
before the show starts.

08:47.918 --> 08:50.138
Eat real food,

08:50.181 --> 08:51.443
otherwise you'll get sick,
both of you.

08:51.487 --> 08:53.315
- O-Okay, Dad. Thank you.
- Okay. Yeah.

08:53.358 --> 08:55.012
Hey, I'm pretty sure funnel cake
batter's made with eggs anyway.

08:55.056 --> 08:56.666
Not funny!

08:56.710 --> 08:58.581
Look at this.

08:58.625 --> 08:59.843
Yeah.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.976
Yeah. Not too bad, huh?

09:02.019 --> 09:03.499
Would the handsome couple
care to

09:03.543 --> 09:04.805
join a competition for the ages?

09:04.848 --> 09:06.633
Randall? Hey.
Hey.

09:06.676 --> 09:08.330
- How's it going, man?
- Good.

09:08.373 --> 09:09.853
Yeah.

09:09.897 --> 09:11.551
Uh, y-you running
this thing or...?

09:11.594 --> 09:13.683
Oh, yeah.
Want to join?

09:13.727 --> 09:15.598
Uh...
Look.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.774
One person
is blindfolded,

09:17.818 --> 09:19.689
and the other one just
- gives them the directions.
- We're gonna...

09:19.733 --> 09:22.518
- And there's a prize.
- Ooh, there's a prize. I'm in.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.693
Ah.

09:23.737 --> 09:24.738
- I'll give directions.
- What?

09:24.781 --> 09:26.391
Come on,
it'll be fun

09:26.435 --> 09:28.089
to boss you around
for a little while.

09:28.132 --> 09:30.134
Let's go.

09:39.317 --> 09:42.494
Hey, um, don't let me
lose to this guy.

09:42.538 --> 09:44.192
Obviously.

09:46.455 --> 09:48.936
- As your game master,
these are the rules.

09:48.979 --> 09:51.634
To win the prize, you have to
complete the course blindfolded,

09:51.678 --> 09:53.593
put the medicine ball
in the bucket,

09:53.636 --> 09:55.159
and cross the finish line first.

09:55.203 --> 09:57.031
That good?

09:57.074 --> 09:59.120
Yeah. Set.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.469
All right.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.124
Let's do this.
Yup.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.256
On your marks.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.258
Get set!

10:08.695 --> 10:10.784
- Now go, come on. No.
- Straight. Right. Forward.

10:10.827 --> 10:13.047
Left, left.
- Now right, right.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

10:13.090 --> 10:15.615
- Which way is it?
- Left! Go left!

10:15.658 --> 10:16.964
Go straight
to the tube.

10:17.007 --> 10:18.618
A little forward,
forward, forward.

10:18.661 --> 10:20.184
There you go. Down.
You're gonna want to crawl.

10:20.228 --> 10:22.360
Now keep going. Now, go, go, go,
go. Yeah. No. Come on!

10:22.404 --> 10:24.667
Come on! You got to tell me
- where to go!
- Stop yelling.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.800
- Just keep going.
- Okay, all right. Okay.

10:26.843 --> 10:28.628
Come on. You got it, you got it,
you got it.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.499
You're doing great.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Crawl!

10:30.542 --> 10:32.719
- Come on! He's beating you!
- Okay, great. Pick up.

10:32.762 --> 10:35.156
Pick up the ball. Okay, now,
- the tires, the tires.
- Yeah, yeah.

10:35.199 --> 10:38.550
Any day now would be good!
Thank you!

10:38.594 --> 10:39.943
- Now, tires. Now right.
- Right, left.

10:41.205 --> 10:43.251
Right, left, uh, yup.

10:43.294 --> 10:45.819
Get up, get up,
- get up, get up. Right.
- Right.

10:45.862 --> 10:48.560
Uh-oh, uh-oh.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

10:48.604 --> 10:50.214
You still got him, you got him,
you got him.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.390
Get up, quick, quick, quick.
- Okay, left.
- Yeah.

10:52.434 --> 10:54.828
- Right, left, right.
- Right, left, left, left.

10:54.871 --> 10:56.481
Left, yeah.
Keep going now, keep going.

10:56.525 --> 10:58.135
- Okay, walk, walk, walk.
- Forward. Come on, come on.

10:58.179 --> 11:00.311
Stop, stop. Spin three times.

11:01.269 --> 11:03.750
Spin. Good job. Yeah.
- Spinning, you're spinning.
- Okay, forward, forward, forward.

11:03.793 --> 11:05.665
No!
The bucket is
in front of you.

11:05.708 --> 11:06.970
Forward. It's right
in front of you!

11:07.014 --> 11:08.885
Come on. Go.

11:08.929 --> 11:11.105
- This? Yeah.
- You got it. Yes!

11:11.148 --> 11:13.194
And now forward!
Go forward! Ah! Go!

11:13.237 --> 11:15.022
Walkers for the win!

11:15.065 --> 11:17.720
Yeah!

11:17.764 --> 11:19.113
Yeah!

11:19.156 --> 11:21.985
Come on!
Are you serious?

11:22.029 --> 11:23.683
You could've moved
so much faster than that.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.815
Yes!

11:25.859 --> 11:27.469
I'm tired.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.079
You did great.
You did great!

11:30.472 --> 11:32.866
Pretty good team
if I do say so myself.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.737
Uh, I think you do.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.565
Um, and we do make
a good team.

11:36.608 --> 11:38.741
However, we do, at some point,
have to talk about

11:38.785 --> 11:40.917
how we decided that
I was gonna be the one

11:40.961 --> 11:43.050
who ended up
blindfolded.

11:43.093 --> 11:44.747
- I'm no dummy.
- Yeah, I know that.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.444
That's right.

11:49.447 --> 11:51.188
- Ugh.
- Take it. T...

11:51.232 --> 11:53.190
No, it's fine.
- I'll call her back later.
- Ger, Ger.

11:53.234 --> 11:54.757
Take it.

11:54.801 --> 11:57.281
- Okay, okay.
- Come on.

11:57.325 --> 11:59.762
You take care of him.

12:02.634 --> 12:05.202
All right, come here, big guy.

12:07.117 --> 12:09.685
How you doing?

12:13.471 --> 12:15.865
How are these
karaoke headphones?

12:17.780 --> 12:20.783
What are karaoke headphones?

12:22.219 --> 12:24.221
You okay?

12:24.265 --> 12:26.093
Yeah.

12:26.136 --> 12:29.618
I just keep thinking
about the ranch.

12:29.661 --> 12:32.186
You know, all the animals,
the ranch hands.

12:32.229 --> 12:34.144
Like, it wasn't just our house.

12:34.188 --> 12:35.972
I get it.

12:36.016 --> 12:39.236
But do you think it might be
worth not worrying right now?

12:39.280 --> 12:41.238
I-I know it sucks,

12:41.282 --> 12:43.197
but you deserve
to enjoy yourself.

12:49.812 --> 12:51.161
Fine.

12:53.468 --> 12:55.165
But sometimes it's good

12:55.209 --> 12:57.298
to be able to talk about
the serious stuff, too.

12:57.341 --> 12:58.821
Right?
Of course.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.997
But doesn't have to be
every day.

13:01.041 --> 13:03.478
You'd be surprised
with my family.

13:03.521 --> 13:06.046
Okay, so...

13:06.089 --> 13:07.874
How do these...

13:07.917 --> 13:10.006
Okay, let's go play some games.

13:12.966 --> 13:15.620
Okay, so you're saying
that he was

13:15.664 --> 13:18.362
both the official authorized
agent and the employer?

13:18.406 --> 13:20.495
Is that even legal?

13:20.538 --> 13:21.931
- I kept him safe. Yeah, yeah.
- Okay. Uh...

13:21.975 --> 13:23.759
And, hey, don't make me hold

13:23.803 --> 13:26.022
your feet to the flames next
time for answers, all right?

13:26.893 --> 13:28.242
Walker.

13:28.285 --> 13:29.591
Hey.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.377
I need you to be a ringer.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.473
Okay, my previous captain,
Fenton Cole,

13:42.517 --> 13:43.866
is here with
Miles's wife, Rita.

13:43.910 --> 13:46.086
And spoiler alert,
they are now dating.

13:46.129 --> 13:47.609
So, since he doesn't know you,

13:47.652 --> 13:49.089
I need you to go in
and get some info.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.873
Okay, uh, real quick,
uh...
Geri.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.440
Hi.
Hi. Sorry.

13:52.483 --> 13:54.050
Got caught up in a whole thing.
How are you?

13:54.094 --> 13:56.444
- You gonna get Cordi in trouble?
- No.

13:57.227 --> 13:58.968
Maybe. Can I borrow him?

13:59.012 --> 14:00.056
Sure.

14:01.014 --> 14:03.016
For a round of drinks
at a later date.

14:03.059 --> 14:04.844
Are you kidding me?
Three rounds.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.584
Okay, hold on, hold on.
Are you sure? Because...Yes. Go.

14:06.628 --> 14:08.369
Sounds important. I'm gonna go
put this guy in my car.

14:08.412 --> 14:10.719
Hey, uh, shouldn't we...

14:10.762 --> 14:12.155
Oh, my gosh, come on.

14:12.199 --> 14:14.244
Move faster!

14:14.288 --> 14:16.159
previous partner,

14:16.203 --> 14:18.248
Miles Vyas, disappeared
six months ago.

14:18.292 --> 14:20.816
Two bullet casings were found
where he was last seen.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.905
Yeah, and those casings matched
the gun that was stolen off you

14:22.949 --> 14:24.602
earlier that night when
you and Miles were separated.

14:24.646 --> 14:26.866
Gun was never found, though.
Or blood or a body.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.911
And with nothing
else, Captain Cole

14:28.955 --> 14:30.652
designated Miles
"presumed dead."

14:30.695 --> 14:32.697
No other evidence in the report?

14:32.741 --> 14:35.962
Well, I can't access the file.
"Conflict of interest."

14:36.005 --> 14:38.529
Fast-forward,
Rita and Fenton show up tonight.

14:38.573 --> 14:40.227
Lovebirds.

14:41.315 --> 14:43.970
Do you think Rita is in on it?

14:44.013 --> 14:45.319
No.

14:45.362 --> 14:46.711
I know that's first
on the checklist,

14:46.755 --> 14:48.496
but she's a horrible liar.

14:49.497 --> 14:51.020
And Rita loves Miles.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.936
Anyway, I spoke to my C.I.
in insurance fraud,

14:53.980 --> 14:55.372
and she said
you need two documents

14:55.416 --> 14:57.157
when someone

14:57.200 --> 14:59.637
notarized early death
certificate from an employer

14:59.681 --> 15:01.248
and a declaration

15:01.291 --> 15:02.771
from an official agent
of the state.

15:02.814 --> 15:05.078
Fenton is the one
who signed off on both.

15:05.121 --> 15:09.082
Okay, w-well, Fenton is
Miles' employer and a-a captain

15:09.125 --> 15:10.997
of the Texas Rangers, so...Yeah, but the lack

15:11.040 --> 15:14.174
of checks and balances,
u-uh, he is now dating Rita.

15:14.217 --> 15:17.046
I mean, we have enough
- for reasonable suspicion.
- Sure. Y-Yes.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.830
I-If this was just
some random guy off the street,

15:18.874 --> 15:21.007
I-I would say,
"Absolutely, let's go with it."

15:21.050 --> 15:24.575
But Fenton is a captain
of the Texas Rangers.

15:24.619 --> 15:27.187
We're gonna need a lot more
than reasonable suspicion.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.450
You're right, I don't
have enough evidence yet,

15:29.493 --> 15:31.365
but Fenton's hiding something.

15:34.150 --> 15:35.717
Walker, I agreed
to be your partner

15:35.760 --> 15:37.110
because you promised
to have my back

15:37.153 --> 15:39.025
when it came to
Miles's case.

15:39.068 --> 15:41.723
How real was that promise?

15:43.986 --> 15:45.596
What's our play?

15:48.164 --> 15:50.123
Self-watering plants.

15:50.166 --> 15:52.212
My Lord, what kind of fool
can't take

15:52.255 --> 15:54.692
the time to water
a damn sprout?

15:54.736 --> 15:57.434
Most people
actually overwater.

15:57.478 --> 15:58.958
It's true.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.141
You okay?
Yep.

16:08.184 --> 16:10.665
- All right, good luck.
- Mm-hmm.

16:14.408 --> 16:16.584
Let's go over here.

16:16.627 --> 16:18.934
Geri, hi.
Hey.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.458
- Cordell wandering out there?
- Oh, yeah.

16:21.502 --> 16:23.808
He got pulled
into some work thing.

16:23.852 --> 16:26.507
I guess it's hard to avoid
the Rangers at a Ranger event.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.117
Yep.

16:28.161 --> 16:31.729
Geri, how do you feel
about us clearing the air?

16:32.730 --> 16:35.298
Uh, sure.

16:37.039 --> 16:40.869
I'm sick about how
all this has affected you.

16:40.912 --> 16:45.091
And I wish I could explain
the moment he told me, but...

16:45.134 --> 16:47.919
I-I was shocked, really.

16:47.963 --> 16:51.706
And it wasn't
who I knew him to be.

16:51.749 --> 16:54.056
12 years had passed.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.450
And he told me, the baby--

16:56.493 --> 17:01.716
you-- were healthy
and well-cared for.

17:01.759 --> 17:05.415
I-I know
this may sound callous,

17:05.459 --> 17:08.375
but it seemed like
Davidson family business.

17:08.418 --> 17:09.985
Not mine.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.074
When I found out
it was you,

17:12.118 --> 17:14.424
it plays differently.

17:15.382 --> 17:17.253
Yeah.

17:19.516 --> 17:21.649
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

17:21.692 --> 17:23.912
If it hadn't been me,

17:23.955 --> 17:25.696
do you think
it would have ever

17:25.740 --> 17:28.308
crossed your mind
that some kid out there

17:28.351 --> 17:30.962
didn't know their whole story?

17:31.006 --> 17:32.573
No.

17:34.140 --> 17:35.924
Gale was so vicious at the time.

17:35.967 --> 17:39.406
I-I didn't think she could
handle that sort of information.

17:39.449 --> 17:41.103
And that was
your choice to make?

17:41.147 --> 17:43.410
- She attacked my son.
- I'm sorry. I'm...

17:44.411 --> 17:45.934
God, I'm sorry, Abby.

17:45.977 --> 17:47.979
Marv should have
told Gale.

17:48.023 --> 17:49.242
That's not on you.

17:49.285 --> 17:51.418
But with everything
that's come out,

17:51.461 --> 17:56.031
I-I feel defensive somehow.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.729
You know?
Well, trust me,

17:58.773 --> 18:01.558
Gale Davidson doesn't need
anyone to protect her.

18:01.602 --> 18:04.083
That woman can defend
herself just fine.

18:05.693 --> 18:08.391
Well, maybe she'd lighten up

18:08.435 --> 18:12.395
if anyone else
was ever on her side.

18:12.439 --> 18:14.876
I'm gonna get going.

18:14.919 --> 18:17.096
I'll see you
at the concert later, okay?

18:22.144 --> 18:24.015
Damn it.

18:26.061 --> 18:27.932
- You ready?
- I'm gonna crush you.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.412
Oh.
I'm competitive.

18:29.456 --> 18:31.371
And I have good aim.

18:31.414 --> 18:33.024
Tell me what prize you want
whenever I win.

18:33.068 --> 18:35.375
Colton, what
are you doing?

18:37.464 --> 18:39.379
Everybody, ready?

18:39.422 --> 18:41.076
Go!

18:44.035 --> 18:45.907
- I got you, Colt.
- Uh-huh.

18:47.778 --> 18:49.998
- Pretty slow, bro.
- I'm telling you--
Okay, eat my dust.

18:54.176 --> 18:55.525
And we have a winner!

18:55.569 --> 18:58.049
Stella!

18:59.094 --> 19:00.530
Here you go.
Congratulations.

19:00.574 --> 19:01.879
Yeah, nice one.

19:05.056 --> 19:07.450
Why are you here?

19:07.494 --> 19:10.453
'Cause I just wanted
to apologize, okay?

19:10.497 --> 19:12.194
I didn't think
my family was actually

19:12.238 --> 19:13.587
gonna go through
with that whole thing.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.589
I thought they were
just ego-tripping.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.678
Okay, I-I think
you might need to leave.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.723
I'm...Just ego-tripping?

19:19.767 --> 19:23.205
Well, it kind of had
a real-life impact, Colton.

19:23.249 --> 19:26.513
We're actual people. Did anyone
in your family remember that?

19:29.298 --> 19:31.126
Come on.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.482
Hey. There he is.

19:39.526 --> 19:41.092
The one leaning
on the table.

19:41.136 --> 19:44.226
Getting access to that file
will solve everything.

19:44.270 --> 19:45.967
I'll get my lead,

19:46.010 --> 19:48.796
and Rita will realize how poorly
Fenton handled everything.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.145
Okay, so,

19:50.189 --> 19:52.103
best-case scenario,
I go in there

19:52.147 --> 19:54.628
and I convince Fenton
to declassify the file.

19:54.671 --> 19:57.239
- Mm-hmm.
- Worst-case scenario,
he figures out

19:57.283 --> 19:58.936
what I'm trying to do and...

19:58.980 --> 20:00.764
Gets you on desk duty for
the rest of your career.

20:00.808 --> 20:01.983
Yeah.

20:02.026 --> 20:03.941
Or not.

20:03.985 --> 20:05.204
Listen,

20:05.247 --> 20:06.814
he's never met you.

20:06.857 --> 20:09.120
But he hates me.
So, lead with that.

20:09.164 --> 20:11.035
Go.

20:11.079 --> 20:12.646
Yeah. You got it.

20:20.610 --> 20:22.438
Excuse me. Sorry.

20:22.482 --> 20:24.135
Captain Cole,

20:24.179 --> 20:25.572
out of Dallas, correct?

20:25.615 --> 20:27.835
- I am.
- Never had the honor.

20:27.878 --> 20:30.272
Uh, Ranger Cordell Walker,
stationed here in Austin.

20:30.316 --> 20:33.580
I've heard of you. Excellent
takedown on that Serano case.

20:33.623 --> 20:34.842
Thank you, sir.

20:34.885 --> 20:36.583
Pleasure."Fenton" is fine.

20:36.626 --> 20:40.326
Thank you, uh, thank
you, Fenton. Uh...

20:40.369 --> 20:44.025
I just got partnered up with,
uh, a former Ranger of yours,

20:44.068 --> 20:46.114
uh, Ranger Perez.

20:46.157 --> 20:47.811
And she's been
giving me some trouble.

20:47.855 --> 20:50.249
Well, if Perez
is giving you trouble,

20:50.292 --> 20:51.989
you probably deserve it.

20:52.033 --> 20:53.817
Uh, I'm sorry?

20:53.861 --> 20:56.864
Perez wasn't with me long,
but she closed out more cases

20:56.907 --> 21:00.650
in a few months than
some of my guys do in a year.

21:00.694 --> 21:02.217
Okay.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.959
That may be the case,
but let's be straight.

21:05.002 --> 21:09.311
Perez's case work on her
previous partner's death

21:09.355 --> 21:11.748
leaves a lot
to be desired, right?

21:11.792 --> 21:14.316
Perez wasn't on the case.

21:14.360 --> 21:18.015
And I'm not sure I have much
patience for whatever this is.

21:18.059 --> 21:20.148
Have a nice day,
Ranger Walker.

21:20.191 --> 21:22.411
This is about Rita Vyas.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.727
Seems to me you're aiming
to pick a fight, Ranger.

21:33.770 --> 21:36.773
No, sir. I'm-I'm simply
calling it how I see it.

21:36.817 --> 21:39.863
The woman I'm
with right now,

21:39.907 --> 21:41.343
we have a complicated past
as well.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.302
Uh, complicated present.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.478
Uh, but we, we've been
through a lot together.

21:46.696 --> 21:48.176
But we have a shorthand,
she and I.

21:48.219 --> 21:51.048
Maybe... we shared
some grief.

21:51.092 --> 21:53.268
As I'm sure you know, share
some grief with somebody,

21:53.312 --> 21:56.402
you'd do pretty much anything
to keep them around, yeah?

21:56.445 --> 21:59.100
I didn't presume Miles dead
to date his wife.

21:59.143 --> 22:02.364
I'm not saying that, sir,
but I got to imagine

22:02.408 --> 22:06.063
that there was already a little
something between you, yeah?

22:06.107 --> 22:08.109
- Well, it's not something
most people would understand,

22:08.152 --> 22:11.504
but it sounds like
you've got a little experience.

22:11.547 --> 22:13.288
She was the wife
of one of my best Rangers.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.855
When he went missing,

22:14.898 --> 22:17.466
well, it started I would
drop by from time to time,

22:17.510 --> 22:19.686
keep Rita informed,
make sure she was okay.

22:19.729 --> 22:22.036
- I mean, of course I did that.
- Of course.

22:22.079 --> 22:24.473
Then I started making excuses
to see her more.

22:25.909 --> 22:27.389
She knew. She understood.

22:27.433 --> 22:30.000
Yeah, of course.
I understand.

22:30.044 --> 22:31.959
But I don't understand

22:32.002 --> 22:35.136
why you would rush
a presumed dead order

22:35.179 --> 22:37.921
without evidence if everything

22:37.965 --> 22:40.141
was already going well
between y'all.

22:40.184 --> 22:42.796
Did you know it can take
up to seven years

22:42.839 --> 22:45.364
to get life insurance money
without a body?

22:45.407 --> 22:47.453
Rita needed it.

22:47.496 --> 22:49.672
She had a mortgage, a daughter.

22:49.716 --> 22:51.848
Didn't want to stand
in the way of that.

23:01.771 --> 23:03.599
Colton.

23:03.643 --> 23:05.427
Hey.

23:05.471 --> 23:07.386
Kind of aggro
for a family event.

23:07.429 --> 23:09.083
You okay?

23:10.258 --> 23:13.348
I'm an idiot.

23:13.392 --> 23:16.307
I came here to apologize
to Stella for...

23:16.351 --> 23:18.440
I don't know
what I could've said

23:18.484 --> 23:19.833
that would've made
anything better.

23:19.876 --> 23:21.791
So, anyway, it was...

23:22.836 --> 23:25.099
...it was not good.

23:25.142 --> 23:27.449
I think we all have
to forgive ourselves

23:27.493 --> 23:29.016
for not being
our best right now.

23:30.278 --> 23:31.497
You done here?

23:31.540 --> 23:33.281
Yeah.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.764
I mean, it's crazy, right?

23:37.807 --> 23:40.506
That you're my aunt?

23:40.549 --> 23:42.769
It is crazy.

23:42.812 --> 23:46.250
I-Is it weird
meeting your bio mom?

23:46.294 --> 23:48.165
I mean, the only time I ever
thought about finding mine

23:48.209 --> 23:49.776
was for medical stuff.

23:49.819 --> 23:51.647
You know, I...

23:51.691 --> 23:53.823
I actually thought the harder
thing to wrap my brain around

23:53.867 --> 23:57.479
was gonna be some of the stuff
about my dad Frank.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.742
But...

23:59.786 --> 24:02.397
after today, uh...

24:02.441 --> 24:04.878
I'm not so sure.

24:04.921 --> 24:09.622
Hey, your grandma
was so welcoming.

24:09.665 --> 24:11.624
And I'm sorry to say this,

24:11.667 --> 24:14.365
but it's not usually the
vibe that she gives off.

24:14.409 --> 24:16.193
Oh, I-I know
my family's a lot.

24:16.237 --> 24:17.804
You don't have to, like, watch
your words with me or anything.

24:17.847 --> 24:19.022
It's fine.

24:19.066 --> 24:21.808
Thank you for that.

24:21.851 --> 24:25.420
Hey, um, what did you mean
that the stuff

24:25.464 --> 24:27.161
about your dad
wasn't the hardest part?

24:27.204 --> 24:28.945
Um...

24:28.989 --> 24:32.427
Look, the-the Walkers,
they-they keep saying that

24:32.471 --> 24:34.473
it doesn't matter
that I'm a Davidson.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.213
I guess I just worry
that some of them

24:36.257 --> 24:38.955
are sort of set in the
way that they see things.

24:38.999 --> 24:41.392
Hey.

24:41.436 --> 24:44.221
Maybe that's something
that you can show Stella.

24:44.265 --> 24:47.921
Tell her that you
understand her side.

24:47.964 --> 24:49.705
Tell her that
you understand

24:49.749 --> 24:54.231
what she lost when the Davidsons
took Walker Ranch.

24:55.842 --> 24:57.321
I think she'd really
appreciate that.

24:58.366 --> 24:59.541
Thanks.

24:59.585 --> 25:00.803
Yeah.

25:08.289 --> 25:09.508
- Rita.

25:11.031 --> 25:12.554
Let me get this straight.
You would seriously

25:12.598 --> 25:15.383
choose money over finding
your missing husband?

25:15.426 --> 25:18.778
Miles is dead, Cassie.
You need to accept that.

25:18.821 --> 25:21.563
No, Fenton botched
- that investigation.
- No.

25:21.607 --> 25:24.131
You are so locked into
your own story that you can't

25:24.174 --> 25:26.394
even stop to think that maybe
he's trying to protect you.

25:26.437 --> 25:27.787
No...The-the case closed

25:27.830 --> 25:29.832
because they found new evidence.

25:29.876 --> 25:31.573
- Rita, Rita, don't.
- What?

25:31.617 --> 25:33.662
No. She's never gonna
let it go unless you tell her.

25:33.706 --> 25:35.142
Wh-- Tell me what?

25:38.493 --> 25:40.756
Uh...

25:40.800 --> 25:42.715
We found your stolen gun.

25:42.758 --> 25:46.501
Guy called it in
about 20 miles from the casings.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.329
There was
evidence of blood.

25:48.372 --> 25:50.461
Forensics confirmed
it was Miles's.

25:51.680 --> 25:54.030
There was no blood
where the casings were found.

25:54.074 --> 25:58.252
We went back to the area,
and a resident finally talked.

25:58.295 --> 26:01.516
Reported seeing Miles forced
into a black van with no plates

26:01.560 --> 26:03.344
by a masked figure.

26:03.387 --> 26:05.520
Once Miles was
inside the van,

26:05.564 --> 26:08.567
gunman shot him twice
from outside, point-blank.

26:08.610 --> 26:11.831
Blood inside the van,
casings landed outside.

26:11.874 --> 26:13.833
No prints on the gun.

26:13.876 --> 26:15.965
No leads.

26:16.009 --> 26:19.142
Why presume him dead
without a body at least?

26:19.186 --> 26:21.318
I asked him to.

26:21.362 --> 26:23.843
When they told me
what they found,

26:23.886 --> 26:26.367
I knew Miles was gone.

26:26.410 --> 26:28.543
But I couldn't just shut down.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.937
I have a kid,
a mortgage, the funeral.

26:30.980 --> 26:33.243
So I asked Fenton

26:33.287 --> 26:35.376
to file the paperwork
for the life insurance policy.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.075
He helped me
when everyone else left.

26:41.948 --> 26:43.297
I thought
keeping things from you

26:43.340 --> 26:44.951
might make it easier
for you to stay.

26:44.994 --> 26:47.475
It was a bad call.

26:47.518 --> 26:49.172
You're a professional.

26:49.216 --> 26:50.739
I'll declassify
the case

26:50.783 --> 26:52.828
and send it over to you
for verification.

26:52.872 --> 26:54.569
You deserve to know everything.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.442
Captain. Thank you.

26:58.486 --> 26:59.922
Uh, we'll take
it from here.

26:59.966 --> 27:01.794
Hey, hey.

27:01.837 --> 27:04.840
You deserve peace, and I hope
this leads you there somehow.

27:07.756 --> 27:09.410
Rita, I...

27:10.716 --> 27:12.369
Hey. Come on.

27:20.987 --> 27:23.598
Oh, I'm looking
forward to Kansas.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.992
Hey, you want to sit with us?
We have space.

27:26.035 --> 27:28.690
Um... Hey.

27:28.734 --> 27:32.694
Yeah, no, I, uh,
I suck at pretending I'm okay.

27:32.738 --> 27:35.697
So I'm just gonna go
see a man about a drink.

27:35.741 --> 27:37.612
Yeah. You got it.

27:38.961 --> 27:40.397
Where are the kids?
Where is everybody?

27:40.441 --> 27:41.921
Hey, man. Late as usual.

27:41.964 --> 27:43.705
Cordi.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.664
- Mama.
- We're all inside. Come on in.

27:46.621 --> 27:48.884
Okay, yeah.
Hey, man.

27:48.928 --> 27:50.538
Perez okay?

27:50.581 --> 27:53.933
Yeah, well, no. Mm.
It's been a day.

27:53.976 --> 27:55.935
You know, uh,
Miles's case.

27:55.978 --> 27:57.719
I'd wait till tomorrow.

27:57.763 --> 27:59.721
I'm gonna do a little damage
control with the Dallas office.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.331
Make a few phone calls.

28:01.375 --> 28:03.246
- Y'all go ahead without me.
- All right, man.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.423
All right.

28:06.467 --> 28:08.077
Kansas! Kansas!

28:26.835 --> 28:28.837
Yeah!

28:38.542 --> 28:40.588
Come on!

29:34.773 --> 29:36.992
Yeah!

29:40.474 --> 29:42.302
Yeah, okay, okay, hey, hey.

29:42.345 --> 29:44.565
UH, Tell Gale to leave you
alone. You're at a concert.

29:44.608 --> 29:46.219
Come on, Cordi, don't do that.

29:46.262 --> 29:47.698
I-I'm-I'm not.

29:47.742 --> 29:49.396
I'm just watching
these guys.

29:49.439 --> 29:52.747
I'm just saying, she-she's being
a little obvious, no?

30:00.233 --> 30:02.061
You want me to go?

30:02.104 --> 30:04.411
No, no. I got it.

30:18.381 --> 30:19.861
Geri. Hey.

30:19.905 --> 30:21.863
- Geri, hold on, hold on.
- I-I-- Dolly. Dolly.

30:21.907 --> 30:23.169
Don't...I have to throw
out a Dolly.

30:23.212 --> 30:25.258
- Okay, what-what happened?
- You said

30:25.301 --> 30:27.869
that if either one of us were
headed in the wrong direction,

30:27.913 --> 30:29.871
"Dolly" would be
our safe word, right?

30:29.915 --> 30:31.177
Right.

30:32.352 --> 30:35.485
Is this about the
text from Gale?

30:35.529 --> 30:37.792
Cordi, she's my birth mom.

30:37.836 --> 30:41.143
Have you given yourself time
to think about that

30:41.187 --> 30:42.841
in any kind of real way?

30:45.756 --> 30:48.194
Uh, I mean, I haven't
really had the time.

30:48.237 --> 30:51.153
But, Geri, y-you said it
yourself this morning

30:51.197 --> 30:52.546
that having the same DNA
doesn't make you

30:52.589 --> 30:54.026
- a Davidson.
- No, but it makes me

30:54.069 --> 30:55.941
someone different
than I always thought I was.

30:55.984 --> 30:58.073
Do you understand that?

30:58.117 --> 30:59.945
Cordi, I don't want to be like

30:59.988 --> 31:02.730
that couple at the race
this morning.

31:02.773 --> 31:04.384
- With what?
- It's simple
enough to say

31:04.427 --> 31:08.083
that you're a team
at the beginning, right?

31:08.127 --> 31:11.217
But those two, they fell out of
sync at some point, didn't they?

31:11.260 --> 31:14.089
They're not us.

31:14.133 --> 31:17.092
I have to tell you,
I had a conversation

31:17.136 --> 31:21.531
with your mom earlier,
and I got so mad.

31:21.575 --> 31:24.143
- And I love Abby.
- I know.

31:24.186 --> 31:26.014
- You know I do.
- Yeah.

31:26.058 --> 31:27.711
But think about
what she did to Gale.

31:27.755 --> 31:29.583
What Marv did to Gale.

31:29.626 --> 31:31.237
Yes, but Abby
made a choice.

31:31.280 --> 31:33.630
A-A choice
that directly affected me.

31:33.674 --> 31:37.025
And I'm not saying that I don't
understand, because I do.

31:37.069 --> 31:38.679
I'm saying

31:38.722 --> 31:40.376
that if I have to show up

31:40.420 --> 31:42.988
for Sunday dinner
at your family's house,

31:43.031 --> 31:46.817
things are gonna be
more than messy.

31:46.861 --> 31:48.297
They're gonna hurt.

31:49.342 --> 31:50.734
I understand. Okay?

31:50.778 --> 31:52.823
I understand.

31:52.867 --> 31:55.261
Geri, I still feel

31:55.304 --> 31:58.133
the same way about you.

31:58.177 --> 32:02.268
And I feel
the same way about you.

32:07.316 --> 32:09.928
I can't do this
together right now.

32:09.971 --> 32:14.236
I have to know
where I stand on my own.

32:15.281 --> 32:17.500
Yeah. And here
we are again.

32:17.544 --> 32:20.939
Always at the end of the world
together, right?

32:23.506 --> 32:25.726
I got to go.

32:25.769 --> 32:28.076
I'm sorry.

32:46.181 --> 32:48.662
Y'all, my car is that way.

32:48.705 --> 32:50.229
All right, now, Trey!

32:50.272 --> 32:51.621
Ask me...

32:51.665 --> 32:53.014
- Good night.
- Drive safe.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.450
- Drive safe.
Hey, Dad.

32:54.494 --> 32:55.974
- I'll toss that.
- Yeah?

32:56.017 --> 32:57.888
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks, Stella.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.334
Hey, Stella?

33:10.162 --> 33:12.555
Hey, I just, I wanted
to give you something.

33:12.599 --> 33:13.992
We don't have
to talk or anything.

33:20.737 --> 33:22.696
This was my mom's.

33:22.739 --> 33:24.567
I hadn't even realized
I left it.

33:24.611 --> 33:27.701
Yeah. I found
it in the space

33:27.744 --> 33:29.920
between the wall and the floor.

33:29.964 --> 33:32.271
Must have gotten lost
during the move.

33:32.314 --> 33:33.446
You know, I thought I
should give it to you,

33:33.489 --> 33:34.925
but I didn't
know when

33:34.969 --> 33:37.450
or if you'd want
to talk to me, so...

33:37.493 --> 33:41.497
But what you said
earlier, it hit me.

33:41.541 --> 33:44.065
It really
finally hit me.

33:44.109 --> 33:46.285
I mean, everything you lost.

33:48.722 --> 33:51.029
Just thought you shouldn't
lose anything else.

33:56.643 --> 33:59.950
Stel, I'm-I'm sorry.

33:59.994 --> 34:03.432
I know it doesn't
mean much, but...

34:03.476 --> 34:05.260
I am.

34:09.351 --> 34:11.310
You know, when I came to Austin,

34:11.353 --> 34:13.877
I was just trying
to survive, but then

34:13.921 --> 34:16.097
we started
hanging out, and...

34:16.141 --> 34:18.926
I mean, it sounds
so stupid now, but...

34:18.969 --> 34:22.364
that song that Sucker Punch
played at The Side Step,

34:22.408 --> 34:26.499
about the good days
and my worries disappear?

34:28.805 --> 34:30.981
That's-that's what
it was with you.

34:31.025 --> 34:35.247
Why didn't you just say
that you wrote that for me?

34:35.290 --> 34:37.640
I mean, that's what
the song was for.

34:38.859 --> 34:40.469
I mean, you saw Todd.
He was effortless.

34:40.513 --> 34:42.471
I didn't stand a chance
against that guy.

34:50.175 --> 34:53.265
Thank you... for this.

34:54.962 --> 34:56.833
Yeah.

35:07.017 --> 35:09.237
- Hey, uh, did you have fun?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.377
You okay?

36:04.118 --> 36:06.207
Oh. "You okay?"

36:06.251 --> 36:08.253
Every woman's favorite question.

36:10.037 --> 36:12.170
All right. I get it.

36:12.213 --> 36:15.216
You don't need me prying
into your business, so...

36:15.260 --> 36:17.044
Listen, I'm-I'm-a just head out.

36:17.087 --> 36:19.655
No. Sorry.

36:20.830 --> 36:22.397
I'm sorry.

36:22.441 --> 36:25.095
Before, I thought, um...

36:25.139 --> 36:27.663
I thought you and Cap
were talking behind my back

36:27.707 --> 36:29.883
in front of my face,
and it pissed me off.

36:29.926 --> 36:31.972
That's my stuff.
It's not yours.

36:32.015 --> 36:33.365
It's all good.

36:33.408 --> 36:35.541
Anyway, look at
this setup.

36:35.584 --> 36:38.021
Just give me a cape
and some star charts,

36:38.065 --> 36:40.546
and I'm ready to go
full Walter Mercado.

36:40.589 --> 36:42.809
I'm sorry, who?

36:44.071 --> 36:46.987
Trey, can I give you
a tarot reading? Hmm?

36:47.030 --> 36:49.076
I have no idea what they mean.

36:49.119 --> 36:51.470
All right, let's do it.

36:51.513 --> 36:53.689
Okay.

36:53.733 --> 36:56.301
Hmm.

36:59.129 --> 37:01.436
Oh.
Uh...

37:01.480 --> 37:03.221
Well, that one
will be your past.

37:03.264 --> 37:06.702
The next one
will be your present.

37:11.098 --> 37:13.492
- That's a nice one.
- What do you think

37:13.535 --> 37:15.102
the lady behind
the lion means?

37:15.145 --> 37:16.582
I think she's the strong one.

37:16.625 --> 37:17.887
Oh.

37:17.931 --> 37:19.237
She's taming the
king of the jungle.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.455
It's a different kind
of strength.

37:20.499 --> 37:23.284
You're very pure
for an adult man.

37:24.764 --> 37:27.332
All right, this last one
will be your future.

37:27.375 --> 37:28.507
Okay.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.118
Mm.

37:32.554 --> 37:34.295
Uh...

37:34.339 --> 37:38.081
I'm not claiming that one.
That's... that's not for me.

37:38.125 --> 37:39.909
No.

37:39.953 --> 37:42.390
No, I-I don't
think it is.

37:42.434 --> 37:44.653
Maybe none of them were.

37:44.697 --> 37:48.135
That one, that one's
definitely for me.

37:50.572 --> 37:52.444
Damn it, Miles.

37:53.836 --> 37:56.491
You know, you were right
about this morning.

37:56.535 --> 38:01.583
James and I were trying to
have a hidden conversation.

38:03.803 --> 38:06.936
Walker's old partner, we were...

38:06.980 --> 38:09.330
eh, we were close.

38:09.374 --> 38:12.507
And seeing you was a reminder
that she's really gone.

38:14.683 --> 38:17.251
Also, you're very
off-putting at first,

38:17.295 --> 38:19.645
so I had to let him
know that, too.

38:20.907 --> 38:22.561
I'll drink to that.

38:24.737 --> 38:26.869
You know, I get the feeling
that when something's wrong,

38:26.913 --> 38:28.784
even if you don't know why,

38:28.828 --> 38:30.873
it's hard for you
not to press for answers.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.876
Sometimes you just got to know.

38:34.921 --> 38:36.575
Yeah.

38:36.618 --> 38:39.795
To finding answers
even when they hurt.

38:46.628 --> 38:48.717
Bring it on.

38:51.764 --> 38:53.940
To different kinds of strength.

38:59.859 --> 39:01.774
Oh!
Oh.
What are you doing?

39:01.817 --> 39:03.297
Mm, I'm sorry.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.385
That was good.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.736
Get out!
Oh, gracious me.

39:56.698 --> 39:59.353
Well...

39:59.397 --> 40:01.268
we got to talk.

40:12.627 --> 40:16.588
and TOYOTA.
