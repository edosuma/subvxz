02:02.750 --> 02:04.250
I think I'm getting nauseous.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.250
Are you gonna throw up?
Do you want me to pull over?

02:10.833 --> 02:12.666
- Hey, hey.

02:19.541 --> 02:21.291
- Here's some water, okay?

02:30.458 --> 02:31.541
Ugh... You okay?

02:38.291 --> 02:40.541
Shouldn't I be over morning sickness
by now?

02:42.041 --> 02:44.625
I mean, every woman's body
is different, right?

02:45.125 --> 02:47.166
Oh, yeah? What do you know
about women's bodies?

02:49.875 --> 02:50.791
Not enough.

02:55.416 --> 02:56.500
You're not worried, are you?

02:57.333 --> 02:58.166
No.

02:59.166 --> 03:00.416
Just thinking.

03:00.500 --> 03:01.333
What?

03:02.666 --> 03:03.708
What? What?

03:06.708 --> 03:07.958
Uh...

03:10.750 --> 03:12.333
Maybe we should go back.

03:16.291 --> 03:19.250
-We're halfway to San Diego.
-I know.

03:19.583 --> 03:20.416
I know.

03:21.000 --> 03:21.833
I just...

03:24.875 --> 03:27.208
It's just been hard
to know for sure.

03:29.541 --> 03:31.041
Dad must think I'm an idiot.

03:33.666 --> 03:37.666
Look, Beck, I know it's not
in your nature to put yourself first,

03:37.750 --> 03:40.958
but in this case, I don't think you should
take Mom and Dad's feelings into account.

03:41.458 --> 03:43.541
I don't think you should take
my feelings into account.

03:43.625 --> 03:46.375
I don't think you should even take
the baby's needs into account.

03:46.458 --> 03:47.458
Okay?

03:47.541 --> 03:48.666
This is about you.

03:49.583 --> 03:50.416
Yeah.

03:51.041 --> 03:54.208
Guess I'll have another
1,500 miles to decide, right?

03:54.708 --> 03:55.541
Right.

03:55.625 --> 03:57.708
-Let's just get back on the road and...
- Help!

03:57.791 --> 03:59.875
-...not worry about any of this.
-Did you hear that?

03:59.958 --> 04:00.833
Hear what?

04:03.875 --> 04:06.250
Help!

04:08.250 --> 04:09.625
Help!

04:12.083 --> 04:12.958
Hello?

04:13.750 --> 04:15.041
Is someone out there?

04:18.916 --> 04:20.500
Help!

04:21.041 --> 04:22.583
I'm lost in here.

04:25.083 --> 04:26.500
Sounds like he's really in trouble.

04:26.583 --> 04:28.416
I've been trying to get to the road,

04:28.500 --> 04:30.041
-but I can't find it!

04:32.041 --> 04:32.958
Okay.

04:33.625 --> 04:34.791
We'd better haul him out.

04:37.208 --> 04:38.125
It's really hot.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.625
Careful. Don't slide down into that ditch.

04:41.708 --> 04:44.416
Watch your arm. I'm gonna pull this thing
off the side of the road.

05:11.708 --> 05:12.583
Kid.

05:13.541 --> 05:15.458
Hey, kid, can you hear me?

05:17.041 --> 05:18.083
Yes!

05:18.166 --> 05:19.416
Help me!

05:19.500 --> 05:21.666
I've been stuck in here for days!

05:24.708 --> 05:26.541
Tobin? Stop calling.

05:28.625 --> 05:30.250
Stop calling, honey.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.583
Hello? What's going on?

05:33.666 --> 05:34.791
We're lost!

05:34.875 --> 05:36.708
Please! Please help!

05:36.791 --> 05:38.083
No! Tobin, no!

05:38.166 --> 05:39.125
No!

05:40.083 --> 05:42.708
There's a woman in there with him.
She's being weird.

05:43.666 --> 05:45.375
Where are you?

05:45.458 --> 05:46.541
Are you coming?

05:47.291 --> 05:49.916
Kid, you're right next to us.
Can you see the road?

05:50.791 --> 05:53.791
No, I can't see anything!

05:53.875 --> 05:55.333
Ah, he's right there.

05:56.166 --> 05:57.041
Cal, wait.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.250
Captain Cal to the rescue!

05:59.791 --> 06:01.125
<i>♪ Da-da-da! ♪</i>

06:17.208 --> 06:18.833
Kid, we're coming!

06:18.916 --> 06:19.916
Where are you?

06:20.000 --> 06:21.750
- Over here!
- Cal, wait.

06:22.291 --> 06:23.916
-Slow down. Ugh!
- Tobin!

06:24.000 --> 06:25.416
Was that your name, Tobin?

06:25.500 --> 06:28.083
- Yes! Please hurry!
- <i>Emergency services.</i>

06:28.166 --> 06:29.916
<i>-Please stay on the line.</i>
- I'm tired!

06:30.000 --> 06:30.833
-Hello?
- Listen...

06:30.916 --> 06:32.583
<i>Kiowa County, 911.</i>

06:32.666 --> 06:34.375
Okay, Tobin, listen to me.

06:34.458 --> 06:36.083
Just sit tight.
We're gonna come to you.

06:36.166 --> 06:38.750
-Hi, uh... I'm on Route 400.
- Help!

06:39.333 --> 06:42.708
I don't know the town name,
but there's a kid lost in the grass.

06:43.875 --> 06:45.625
- Tobin!

06:47.458 --> 06:48.416
Fuck.

06:56.791 --> 06:57.625
Cal?

07:00.041 --> 07:00.916
Cal?

07:05.333 --> 07:06.708
Fuck.

07:13.083 --> 07:13.958
Kid!

07:16.333 --> 07:17.458
God.

07:17.541 --> 07:19.541
Kid! Where are you?

07:26.666 --> 07:27.625
Kid!

07:30.041 --> 07:30.875
Becky!

07:33.916 --> 07:35.541
-Becky?
- I'm fine.

07:36.041 --> 07:38.833
I lost the 911 chick.
Is your phone working?

07:40.666 --> 07:42.666
No, I left my phone in the car.

07:44.291 --> 07:45.458
And my glasses.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.833
-Tobin!
- Are you coming?

07:49.791 --> 07:52.791
Please, keep coming. I can't find you.

07:53.458 --> 07:56.625
Kid, you sound like you're headed
for Nebraska. Stay still!

07:57.208 --> 08:00.666
I don't care how scared you are,
don't move. Let us come to you.

08:02.166 --> 08:03.000
Becky!

08:03.791 --> 08:05.416
Becky, where the hell are you?

08:06.666 --> 08:07.791
I'm right here.

08:10.166 --> 08:11.041
Cal?

08:12.375 --> 08:15.750
Something's not right about this.
I think we should head back to the road.

08:15.833 --> 08:17.583
What about the kid and his mom?

08:18.291 --> 08:20.041
Let's just get back together first.

08:20.125 --> 08:23.833
I'll keep talking and you work your way
back towards me, okay?

08:23.916 --> 08:25.000
All right. Good idea.

08:27.208 --> 08:28.583
Okay, start talking.

08:30.208 --> 08:32.707
What do you talk about
when you're lost in a field?

08:33.875 --> 08:37.082
Thousands of miles of gabbing,
and you can't think of anything to say?

08:41.875 --> 08:44.541
There once was a guy named McSweeney

08:44.625 --> 08:46.791
Who spilled some gin on his weenie

08:47.125 --> 08:49.250
Just to be couth, he added vermouth

08:49.333 --> 08:51.666
And slipped his girl a martini

08:51.750 --> 08:52.958
Oh, that's charming.

08:54.458 --> 08:57.625
Hey, you guys,
are you looking for me? I'm scared!

08:58.125 --> 08:59.916
Yes. Yes. Hang on.

09:00.541 --> 09:01.375
Becky!

09:01.458 --> 09:02.916
Becky, keep talking.

09:03.708 --> 09:05.708
There once was a woman named Jill

09:05.791 --> 09:08.291
Who swallowed an exploding pill

09:08.375 --> 09:10.333
They found her vagina in North Carolina--

09:10.416 --> 09:12.958
Aah! Stop, stop. I overshot you somehow.

09:13.625 --> 09:15.916
Cal, quit fucking around.
This isn't funny.

09:18.208 --> 09:19.041
Becky?

09:19.833 --> 09:20.666
Yeah?

09:23.750 --> 09:25.875
You're right,
there's something wrong here.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.166
All right, let's just do this.

09:28.250 --> 09:31.083
On the count of three, we both jump
with our hands raised in the air.

09:31.166 --> 09:32.250
Can you jump?

09:32.333 --> 09:34.833
Yeah, of course I can jump.
What do you think?

09:34.916 --> 09:37.833
I think you're gonna have a baby
this summer, that's what I think.

09:38.958 --> 09:40.916
Cal, stop walking away.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.041
I didn't move!

09:42.125 --> 09:45.625
Yeah. Yeah, you did.
You must have! You still are.

09:45.708 --> 09:47.583
I'm not. I swear I'm not.

09:48.416 --> 09:49.833
Okay, just...

09:49.916 --> 09:51.291
Forget it. Let's just do this.

09:51.375 --> 09:52.375
All right?

09:52.458 --> 09:53.500
-Ready?
-Okay.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.375
One, two, three!

10:00.166 --> 10:01.000
You're close.

10:01.541 --> 10:02.458
One more time.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.791
-All right.
-One, two, three.

10:15.708 --> 10:17.583
This is nuts! This is fucking nuts!

10:17.666 --> 10:18.541
Becky!

10:19.333 --> 10:20.291
Becky!

10:21.958 --> 10:23.666
-Becky!
<i>-</i> Over here!

10:27.083 --> 10:27.916
Beck!

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000

Beck!

10:31.625 --> 10:33.125
Over here!

10:34.458 --> 10:35.625
Becky!

11:16.916 --> 11:19.250
Cal? Are you okay? What is it?

11:21.708 --> 11:22.541
Nothing!

11:24.500 --> 11:25.916
I just... I just slipped.

11:30.291 --> 11:32.041
I'm getting a little freaked out here.

11:32.541 --> 11:33.625
What are we gonna do?

11:33.708 --> 11:35.875
We're gonna get out of here.

11:36.708 --> 11:38.291
We just need to keep our heads.

11:39.291 --> 11:41.416
-What about the kid?
-Forget the kid.

11:42.333 --> 11:43.708
This is about us now.

11:57.291 --> 11:58.333
Becky!

11:59.708 --> 12:00.666
Cal!

12:02.500 --> 12:03.791
Becky!

12:04.750 --> 12:05.666
Cal?

12:06.750 --> 12:07.666
Beck.

12:08.375 --> 12:09.208
Cal.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.875
Beck, just stay where you are,
okay? Don't move.

12:13.916 --> 12:15.166
Save your voice.

12:16.083 --> 12:17.333
I'm gonna come to you.

12:46.041 --> 12:47.666
- Becky!

12:49.250 --> 12:50.458
Beck!

12:50.541 --> 12:51.583
Cal?

12:51.666 --> 12:53.125
-Beck!
-Cal!

12:55.458 --> 12:56.291
Hi, there.

12:56.916 --> 12:57.750
You all right?

12:58.125 --> 12:59.416
Becky, you there?

13:00.166 --> 13:01.000
There's a man here.

13:01.083 --> 13:03.583
It's okay, Cal. This is Tobin's daddy.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.750
If you wanna get out of here,
come with me.

13:08.416 --> 13:10.375
If you could get out,
why are you still in?

13:10.875 --> 13:14.541
I'm looking for my boy and my wife.
They're lost in here, too.

13:15.416 --> 13:18.125
Look, it's gonna be dark soon.
We should stick together.

13:22.375 --> 13:25.125
I understand.
You don't know me from Adam.

13:25.208 --> 13:26.041
Uh...

13:26.125 --> 13:29.250
Ross Humbolt's the name.
Real estate's the game.

13:29.333 --> 13:31.500
Poughkeepsie, wife's Natalie, boy's Tobin.

13:32.083 --> 13:33.708
Becky, what's happening?

13:36.791 --> 13:38.041
I'm all right, Cal.

13:39.583 --> 13:41.041
You can find my brother?

13:41.125 --> 13:42.750
Your brother, I'll try, yeah.

13:42.833 --> 13:46.083
Not like walking a straight line, though.
Nothing is around here.

13:46.833 --> 13:48.125
Just follow me, but stay close.

13:48.208 --> 13:50.958
Whatever you do,
don't lose sight of me, okay?

13:51.416 --> 13:52.250
Okay.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.791
Hang tight, Cal. We're coming for ya.

14:13.708 --> 14:15.000
Becky!

14:17.041 --> 14:18.500
Becky!

14:20.958 --> 14:22.250
Becky!

14:40.500 --> 14:42.208
I'm never gonna find her.

14:43.666 --> 14:45.250
- You can find things.

14:46.375 --> 14:48.083
But it's easier once they're dead.

14:53.250 --> 14:54.166
Tobin?

14:54.791 --> 14:57.041
The field doesn't move dead things around.

15:05.875 --> 15:06.750
Tobin...

15:09.583 --> 15:11.166
did you lure us in here?

15:13.250 --> 15:14.250
You can tell me.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.333
Okay?

15:17.125 --> 15:18.125
I won't be mad.

15:21.583 --> 15:22.416
No.

15:23.541 --> 15:24.916
We heard someone yelling.

15:25.416 --> 15:26.291
A man.

15:27.750 --> 15:29.041
He was calling for help.

15:30.416 --> 15:31.625
That's how we got in.

15:32.708 --> 15:34.000
That's how it works.

15:34.666 --> 15:36.583
How long have you been in here?

15:36.666 --> 15:37.750
I'm not sure.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.375
Becky...

15:43.541 --> 15:44.583
your sister...

15:47.833 --> 15:49.333
she's gonna die soon.

16:01.791 --> 16:03.625
How do you know she's my sister?

16:03.958 --> 16:04.833
The rock.

16:05.541 --> 16:07.708
The rock teaches you
to hear the tall grass.

16:08.166 --> 16:09.791
The tall grass knows everything.

16:13.166 --> 16:14.000
Then...

16:14.750 --> 16:16.208
you must know where she is.

16:17.416 --> 16:18.250
Yeah?

16:19.583 --> 16:21.000
I can find out for you.

16:22.916 --> 16:23.750
No...

16:24.500 --> 16:25.875
I can do better than that.

16:27.416 --> 16:28.541
I can show you.

16:29.833 --> 16:30.916
Do you wanna see her?

16:31.750 --> 16:32.750
Do you wanna check on her?

16:32.833 --> 16:34.708
Come on, follow me.

16:51.375 --> 16:52.541
How far are you along?

16:53.625 --> 16:54.708
Oh, uh...

16:54.791 --> 16:56.208
-Six months.
-Oh!

16:58.500 --> 17:00.166
I remember when Natalie was pregnant.

17:02.125 --> 17:03.708
Those were the salad days.

17:03.791 --> 17:04.625
Enjoy it.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.458
Enjoy your baby, because it goes fast.

17:11.458 --> 17:12.290
Oh.

17:12.790 --> 17:14.040
Dad not in the picture?

17:17.208 --> 17:18.290
He wasn't ready for it.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.125
Well, too bad for him.

17:21.375 --> 17:22.290
Hmm.

17:23.415 --> 17:24.290
You know...

17:25.040 --> 17:26.208
family's everything.

17:28.540 --> 17:30.125
If there's one thing I know for certain,

17:30.750 --> 17:31.958
it's that simple truth.

17:33.958 --> 17:35.291
Well, we better get going.

17:36.083 --> 17:37.875
The sooner we get to them, the better.

17:56.250 --> 17:57.125
Ross?

18:02.333 --> 18:03.166
Hello?

18:08.000 --> 18:08.833
Hello?

18:15.791 --> 18:16.625
Cal!

18:18.000 --> 18:19.375
Are you out there?

18:20.416 --> 18:21.250
Cal?

18:22.916 --> 18:23.750
Cal!

18:29.250 --> 18:30.166
Tobin!

18:31.916 --> 18:33.083
Tobin, you gotta wait!

18:37.250 --> 18:38.791
Hey, Tobin!

18:39.500 --> 18:40.708
Just a little further.

18:40.791 --> 18:42.833
Wait. Tobin, wait. Wait up.

18:44.458 --> 18:45.750
-Tobin.
-Here it is.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.000
Wait, please.

18:47.083 --> 18:47.958
Wait for me.

18:51.083 --> 18:52.041
Oh, my God.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.333
Boy, that feels good.

19:08.833 --> 19:10.125
Come on, Cal. Try it.

20:13.875 --> 20:14.708
Becky!

20:14.791 --> 20:16.625
Get away from me!

20:16.708 --> 20:18.750
-Get away from me!
<i>-</i> Sorry, Cal.

20:19.333 --> 20:20.333
Too late.

20:23.125 --> 20:24.416
Becky!

20:25.000 --> 20:26.166
Wait!

20:26.250 --> 20:27.958
You'll never find her that way.

20:29.166 --> 20:30.416
Becky!

20:32.083 --> 20:33.625
Becky!

20:34.666 --> 20:36.250
Becky!

20:37.958 --> 20:40.000
Becky!

21:27.916 --> 21:29.000
Um...

21:30.500 --> 21:31.958
I'm trying to find these two.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.083
Have you seen them?

21:36.875 --> 21:39.625
<i>...south breezes today,</i>
<i>we've certainly been warming up.</i>

21:39.708 --> 21:41.500
<i>That is about to change</i>
<i>as another cold front</i>

21:41.583 --> 21:43.250
<i>moves in late tonight into the morning.</i>

21:43.333 --> 21:45.333
<i>Ahead of that, clouds increase tonight.</i>

21:45.416 --> 21:47.250
<i>Humidity level creeps up</i>
<i>just a little bit,</i>

21:47.333 --> 21:51.000
<i>and that helps to kind of set the stage</i>
<i>for some drizzle, possibly,</i>

21:51.083 --> 21:54.791
<i>across especially eastern and southeastern</i>
<i>counties for your Tuesday.</i>

21:54.875 --> 21:56.083
<i>But much cooler weather.</i>

21:56.166 --> 21:57.791
<i>It's not gonna be cool.</i>

21:57.875 --> 22:00.083
<i>Considering this time of year,</i>
<i>abnormally cool.</i>

22:00.166 --> 22:02.041
<i>But today was abnormally warm.</i>

22:51.000 --> 22:51.833
Becky?

23:22.125 --> 23:23.000
Becky?

25:28.375 --> 25:29.291
Becky?

26:15.458 --> 26:16.333
Becky.

26:34.333 --> 26:35.166
What?

28:12.000 --> 28:12.833
You okay?

28:13.208 --> 28:14.083
Who are you?

28:14.166 --> 28:15.541
Shh.

28:17.125 --> 28:18.041
Do you hear that?

28:20.041 --> 28:21.041
Hear what?

28:39.500 --> 28:40.666
Everyone else.

28:42.166 --> 28:43.583
If you don't pay attention,

28:44.041 --> 28:45.208
they go away.

28:46.041 --> 28:46.875
Who do?

28:47.583 --> 28:49.375
The people who are stuck in here.

28:49.458 --> 28:52.875
But they're not connected to us,
so... doesn't matter.

28:54.208 --> 28:55.041
We...

28:55.500 --> 28:56.625
are connected?

28:56.708 --> 28:57.625
Sure.

28:57.708 --> 28:58.791
'Cause you know me.

29:00.125 --> 29:01.666
No, I... I don't.

29:02.291 --> 29:03.333
You don't remember?

29:03.416 --> 29:05.916
-Look, kid, we've never met before. I'm--
-Travis.

29:09.541 --> 29:10.500
How do you know my name?

29:10.583 --> 29:12.000
You're looking for Becky.

29:12.458 --> 29:13.416
You...

29:16.375 --> 29:17.500
You know Becky?

29:18.250 --> 29:19.166
Of course.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.791
Wait, how's that even...
Who the hell are you?

29:21.875 --> 29:23.000
Tobin.

29:23.083 --> 29:23.916
Tobin?

29:25.958 --> 29:27.625
You really don't remember?

29:28.875 --> 29:30.416
Look, do you know where she is?

29:33.250 --> 29:34.291
You do, don't you?

29:36.708 --> 29:38.125
Hey, you gotta tell me!

29:38.708 --> 29:39.875
Tell me!

29:39.958 --> 29:40.833
Where is she?

29:41.375 --> 29:42.916
Look at me! Where is she?

29:45.291 --> 29:46.458
I can show you.

29:47.666 --> 29:48.875
-But...
-But what?

29:49.583 --> 29:51.583
-Are you sure you wanna see her?
-Of course! Just...

29:54.583 --> 29:55.416
Please.

29:56.125 --> 29:57.000
Tobin.

29:57.416 --> 29:58.291
All right.

29:59.333 --> 30:01.708
But you gotta stay close.

30:30.000 --> 30:30.833
There.

30:33.416 --> 30:34.250
Becky?

30:37.416 --> 30:38.250
Becky?

30:38.833 --> 30:39.958
Becky!

30:43.750 --> 30:45.500
Becky. No.

30:46.875 --> 30:47.791
Becky.

30:48.583 --> 30:49.416
Oh, Becky.

30:50.041 --> 30:51.958
The field doesn't move dead things.

30:53.208 --> 30:54.666
It makes them easier to find.

30:54.750 --> 30:57.000
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my...

30:59.166 --> 31:00.000
Help!

31:03.166 --> 31:04.000
Tobin?

31:07.166 --> 31:08.000
Tobin!

32:52.541 --> 32:54.416
Well, we don't know
whose car it is...

32:55.833 --> 32:56.666
Hello?

32:56.750 --> 32:58.333
Don't cross the road!

32:58.416 --> 33:00.250
-Hello!
- Tobin, keep an eye on Freddy.

33:00.333 --> 33:01.166
Hey!

33:02.041 --> 33:04.083
Hey! I'm stuck in here!

33:04.625 --> 33:05.541
Help me!

33:06.458 --> 33:07.500
Help me!

33:07.583 --> 33:09.791
Hello? Is someone out there?

33:11.416 --> 33:12.333
Tobin?

33:14.125 --> 33:15.291
Tobin, is that you?

33:16.125 --> 33:17.791
-Tobin, it's Travis.

33:18.875 --> 33:21.416
What, you... you don't remember me now?

33:21.916 --> 33:24.000
Over there, Mommy. Do you hear him?

33:24.916 --> 33:26.916
What? Where, honey?

33:27.000 --> 33:28.083
In the grass.

33:28.916 --> 33:30.125
He knows my name.

33:31.208 --> 33:32.416
-Are you sure?
- Tobin?

33:33.708 --> 33:35.833
-It's okay, Freddy. Stay.
- Help me!

33:35.916 --> 33:38.333
-Get out! Get somebody.
-We'll close when I get back next week.

33:38.416 --> 33:39.416
Okay?

33:40.250 --> 33:41.875
-What?

33:41.958 --> 33:44.041
-No. No, no, no. I'm telling you.
- Freddy!

33:44.125 --> 33:45.125
Don't back out of escrow.

33:45.208 --> 33:46.750
-You're not overpaying.
-Tobin! Damn it!

33:47.500 --> 33:49.375
-Ross!
-Uh, just a minute, please.

33:49.833 --> 33:50.916
- Freddy!

33:53.041 --> 33:55.833
Toby, stay close.
Don't go in there, it's private property.

33:55.916 --> 33:57.166
He went after Freddy.

33:59.875 --> 34:00.708
Toby!

34:01.250 --> 34:02.458
Tobin!

34:02.541 --> 34:03.791
Toby, where are ya?

34:03.875 --> 34:05.416
- Tobin!
- Freddy!

34:05.500 --> 34:07.875
Toby, don't worry about Freddy.
Just come back to us.

34:07.958 --> 34:10.083
Tobin, where are you, honey?

34:10.166 --> 34:11.000
Toby!

34:11.083 --> 34:12.291
Freddy!

34:15.916 --> 34:17.166
Freddy!

34:18.125 --> 34:18.958
Tobin!

34:19.500 --> 34:22.708
If you're still outside the grass,
don't come back in here!

34:22.791 --> 34:24.375
Tobin, where are you?

34:24.458 --> 34:25.583
I'm over here, Mommy.

34:25.666 --> 34:28.375
Tobin Humbolt, didn't you hear
your mother? Come back here!

34:28.458 --> 34:29.750
Honey, can you see him?

34:29.833 --> 34:31.083
-Where is he?
- Over here!

34:31.166 --> 34:33.541
- Sounds like he's in front of us.
-Are you Tobin's dad?

34:33.625 --> 34:35.500
Yeah. Who are you? What's going on?

34:35.583 --> 34:38.250
-Don't come in here!
- Little late for that, buddy.

34:38.750 --> 34:39.583
Tobin.

34:40.375 --> 34:41.583
Where are you, Tobin?

34:43.166 --> 34:44.083
Tobin.

34:45.583 --> 34:46.916
Honey, I'm getting scared.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.333
It's only a field.

34:48.416 --> 34:50.125
That guy, though, I'm not so sure about.

34:50.208 --> 34:52.625
Toby, don't let that man get near you,
okay? Don't talk to him.

34:52.708 --> 34:53.916
If you see him, you run.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.333
I'm afraid, Daddy!

34:55.416 --> 34:57.708
Did you hear that? He went right by us.

34:57.791 --> 34:58.958
- No, honey, no!
-Tobin!

34:59.041 --> 35:00.625
-He went the other way!
-Tobin!

35:01.125 --> 35:01.958
Natalie!

35:02.583 --> 35:03.583
Natalie, wait!

35:05.916 --> 35:06.833
Natalie!

35:08.416 --> 35:10.083
- Tobin?

35:11.750 --> 35:12.666
Natalie!

35:19.958 --> 35:21.416
Toby!

35:22.791 --> 35:23.875
Natalie!

35:25.833 --> 35:26.791
Toby.

35:28.458 --> 35:29.291
Natalie.

35:33.291 --> 35:35.541
Okay. Okay, Rossy boy. Hold it together.

35:36.250 --> 35:38.458
Stay positive.
That's what's gonna get you out of this.

35:39.125 --> 35:40.708
It's gonna get you out of this.

35:41.166 --> 35:43.583
"Mind that's light sells right."

35:44.708 --> 35:48.500
"Mind that's light sells right." Right?
"The mind that's light sells right."

35:49.250 --> 35:52.958
Right? "The mind that's light sells right.
The mind that's light sells right.

35:53.041 --> 35:54.000
The mind that..."

35:55.583 --> 35:57.166
Mind... Fuck.

35:59.250 --> 36:01.500
Fuck. This fucking kid. Fucking kid.

36:02.041 --> 36:02.958
Can't listen?

36:04.250 --> 36:05.750
You can't just fucking listen?

36:06.416 --> 36:09.875
Maybe if your mother acted like a mother
for once, kept an eye on you.

36:12.791 --> 36:13.708
Tobin!

36:14.916 --> 36:16.208
Natalie!

37:48.375 --> 37:50.708
Help!

37:53.333 --> 37:54.375
Help!

37:58.958 --> 37:59.791
Hello?

38:00.583 --> 38:01.750
Is someone out there?

38:01.833 --> 38:03.333
Help!

38:03.416 --> 38:05.791
- I'm lost in here!
- Sounds like he's in trouble.

38:05.875 --> 38:07.875
-I've been trying to get to the road...

38:07.958 --> 38:09.250
...but I can't find it!

38:09.333 --> 38:10.208
Okay.

38:10.916 --> 38:12.250
We better haul him out.

38:14.333 --> 38:15.541
It's really hot.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.083
Careful.
Don't slide down into that ditch.

38:19.166 --> 38:22.125
Watch your arm. I'm gonna pull this thing
off the side of the road.

38:49.375 --> 38:50.833
Help me!

38:50.916 --> 38:52.291
Help me!

38:53.833 --> 38:55.291
Where are you?

38:55.375 --> 38:56.791
Are you coming?

39:14.458 --> 39:16.916
There once was
a man named McSweeney

39:17.000 --> 39:19.375
Who spilled some gin on his weenie

39:19.458 --> 39:21.583
Just to be couth, he added vermouth

39:21.666 --> 39:23.500
And slipped his girl a martini

39:24.791 --> 39:26.125
Oh, that's charming.

39:27.625 --> 39:31.125
Hey, you guys,
are you looking for me? I'm scared!

39:31.208 --> 39:33.041
Yes. Yes. Hang on.

39:33.666 --> 39:34.583
Becky!

39:34.666 --> 39:35.916
Becky, keep talking.

39:36.416 --> 39:38.083
There once was a woman named Jill...

39:38.166 --> 39:41.041
-Becky?
-...Who swallowed an exploding pill

39:41.125 --> 39:43.291
They found her vagina in North Carolina--

39:43.375 --> 39:45.000
Stop, stop. I overshot you.

39:45.083 --> 39:45.916
Becky?

39:46.875 --> 39:47.708
Becky!

39:48.791 --> 39:50.166
Cal, are you in here?

39:51.333 --> 39:52.208
Hello?

39:53.000 --> 39:54.875
- Is someone else out there?

39:54.958 --> 39:57.041
Becky, it's me, Travis!

39:58.041 --> 39:58.958
Travis?

39:59.416 --> 40:00.791
I'm in here!

40:00.875 --> 40:02.208
I'm in here, too!

40:02.291 --> 40:03.125
What?

40:03.875 --> 40:06.125
How...
How the hell did you get here?

40:06.208 --> 40:07.625
I don't know, but I'm here.

40:07.708 --> 40:09.458
Why? Why the fuck are you here?

40:10.125 --> 40:11.166
I...

40:11.958 --> 40:13.375
I came looking for you.

40:13.458 --> 40:15.916
But how did you get here before us?

40:16.416 --> 40:19.166
I don't know.
But it doesn't matter now.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.583
You're here.

40:21.666 --> 40:22.666
We're all here.

40:23.291 --> 40:24.291
It doesn't matter.

40:24.375 --> 40:25.875
Travis?

40:25.958 --> 40:27.250
Is that you?

40:28.166 --> 40:29.000
Tobin?

40:30.625 --> 40:31.458
You okay?

40:32.125 --> 40:33.458
I found Freddy.

40:33.958 --> 40:35.625
-He's dead.
-Freddy?

40:35.708 --> 40:37.625
-Someone killed him.
-Freddy?

40:37.708 --> 40:39.000
Who's Freddy?

40:39.083 --> 40:40.083
My dog.

40:40.166 --> 40:41.750
His guts are all out.

40:42.750 --> 40:43.583
Tobin...

40:45.708 --> 40:47.375
are you with Freddy now?

40:47.458 --> 40:48.333
Yeah.

40:48.791 --> 40:49.958
Okay.

40:50.041 --> 40:51.916
Okay, just stay where you are.

40:52.375 --> 40:53.666
Okay? Don't move.

40:53.750 --> 40:55.083
We're gonna come to you.

40:55.875 --> 40:56.791
All right? Just...

40:57.333 --> 40:58.416
just keep talking.

40:58.791 --> 41:01.166
Do you hear that? Becky? Cal?

41:01.250 --> 41:03.041
Yeah, but we already tried that.

41:03.125 --> 41:04.666
And it didn't work.

41:05.125 --> 41:06.916
Well, this time, I think it might.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.958
Follow Tobin's voice, okay?

41:09.041 --> 41:09.875
Tobin?

41:09.958 --> 41:11.000
Start talking!

41:11.875 --> 41:13.333
Like what Becky was doing?

41:13.416 --> 41:14.250
Yeah.

41:14.750 --> 41:16.750
-Yeah, just like that.
-Okay.

41:17.458 --> 41:20.375
There once was a man named McSweeney

41:20.875 --> 41:23.416
Who spilled some gin on his weenie?

41:23.500 --> 41:25.708
Just to be couth, he...

41:26.500 --> 41:27.833
Um...

41:27.916 --> 41:29.750
I forgot the next part.

41:30.583 --> 41:33.333
He put something on his weenie

41:33.916 --> 41:37.875
Uh... And then slipped his girl a martini?

41:38.791 --> 41:40.333
What's a martini?

41:44.458 --> 41:45.583
It's a drink.

41:46.166 --> 41:47.208
You're Travis?

41:49.083 --> 41:52.250
And that's a dirty rhyme, not for kids.

42:03.625 --> 42:05.166
- Becky!
- Oh!

42:05.250 --> 42:06.458
-Thank God!
-Oh, God!

42:07.666 --> 42:09.666
It's okay. It's okay.

42:13.166 --> 42:14.708
What the fuck is going on?

42:15.708 --> 42:16.583
The field...

42:17.666 --> 42:19.083
it doesn't move dead things.

42:19.625 --> 42:21.125
That doesn't make any sense.

42:21.208 --> 42:22.833
Name one thing in here that does.

42:22.916 --> 42:25.125
So, explain to us again how you got here.

42:26.500 --> 42:27.416
I followed you.

42:28.833 --> 42:31.416
You must have been right on our asses
the whole way.

42:31.500 --> 42:33.375
Oh, no, no. I came after.

42:34.250 --> 42:35.083
After what?

42:36.083 --> 42:36.916
After...

42:39.250 --> 42:40.750
you didn't show up in San Diego.

42:42.250 --> 42:44.375
We just left two days ago.

42:44.458 --> 42:45.291
No.

42:45.375 --> 42:48.875
No, it was longer than that.
It was more like... two months.

42:50.166 --> 42:52.416
Now, that really doesn't make any sense.

42:52.500 --> 42:54.583
I think we have to focus
on how the hell we get out.

42:54.666 --> 42:57.500
Well, I'm not making Becky
blindly walk through Wonderland anymore.

42:57.583 --> 42:59.916
-We need some kind of plan.
-Well, we can't just sit here.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.541
-Are you okay?

43:03.083 --> 43:03.958
Yeah, fine.

43:12.083 --> 43:13.916
-I think we have to get moving.
- Yeah.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.625
No, I agree. Let's just go.

43:15.708 --> 43:17.333
-Well, in which direction?
-I don't know!

43:17.666 --> 43:19.083
In any direction.

43:19.166 --> 43:20.625
Why? What's the point?

43:20.708 --> 43:23.000
The point is I don't want to stay here.

43:23.083 --> 43:24.541
Someone is watching us.

43:25.750 --> 43:26.750
I can feel it.

43:28.041 --> 43:28.916
Okay.

43:29.833 --> 43:30.666
Tobin,

43:31.041 --> 43:32.791
-hop on my shoulders.
-Okay.

43:36.166 --> 43:37.416
Okay.

43:38.208 --> 43:39.083
Okay.

43:40.250 --> 43:42.125
Do you see anything other than grass?

43:42.208 --> 43:43.250
No.

43:43.333 --> 43:44.708
Just grass...

43:45.250 --> 43:46.625
and more grass.

43:49.166 --> 43:50.583
-Wait!
- What?

43:51.083 --> 43:52.583
I think I see something.

43:52.666 --> 43:54.625
It's a building, I think.

43:55.416 --> 43:56.458
That church?

43:56.541 --> 43:59.375
No, I can't tell. It's too far away.

44:00.500 --> 44:02.666
-Okay, which way is it?
-That way.

44:14.041 --> 44:17.625
So, you saw our car at the church
and you didn't call anybody?

44:18.083 --> 44:19.666
No, Cal, I didn't.

44:20.125 --> 44:21.375
You still see it?

44:21.458 --> 44:22.583
Getting closer.

44:25.916 --> 44:30.083
I don't suppose you, um, told anyone
where you were headed, did you?

44:31.500 --> 44:32.333
No.

44:33.458 --> 44:34.875
Not that it'll make much difference.

44:36.375 --> 44:37.750
Somebody'll look for us.

44:38.708 --> 44:40.333
Your folks are worried sick.

44:40.958 --> 44:43.583
What could they do?
You ask me, I don't think anyone's coming.

44:44.541 --> 44:45.500
You did.

44:48.291 --> 44:49.166
Yeah, and...

44:50.416 --> 44:52.416
everyone thought I was crazy for trying.

44:56.458 --> 44:58.708
Yeah. It's been a while since I checked.

45:02.750 --> 45:03.875
-Are you okay?

45:03.958 --> 45:04.875
Mm-hmm.

45:05.583 --> 45:07.125
Fine. Just, um...

45:08.208 --> 45:09.166
Just a kick...

45:09.833 --> 45:10.750
I think.

45:10.833 --> 45:12.500
Is the baby coming soon?

45:13.333 --> 45:14.666
She's due in three months.

45:16.125 --> 45:17.500
-She?
- Yeah.

45:18.125 --> 45:19.625
Didn't wanna wait to find out.

45:20.333 --> 45:22.375
Ginny is what I'm calling her.

45:22.458 --> 45:25.541
For now, anyways,
after my great aunt Virginia.

45:26.125 --> 45:27.000
Ginny.

45:27.916 --> 45:29.083
You don't like it?

45:29.791 --> 45:31.250
No. No, it's...

45:32.958 --> 45:33.791
It's cool.

45:34.291 --> 45:35.166
Old-school.

45:35.750 --> 45:37.500
Yeah. She's lively.

45:40.166 --> 45:41.250
Moves around a lot.

45:43.666 --> 45:44.541
Here.

45:48.458 --> 45:49.291
-Whoa!

45:49.625 --> 45:50.458
Wow.

45:52.458 --> 45:53.791
Lively is the word for it.

45:54.416 --> 45:55.250
Yeah.

46:06.208 --> 46:07.041
Hello?

46:08.208 --> 46:10.583
<i>Don't let Cal hurt Travis!</i>

46:11.166 --> 46:12.375
<i>Don't leave him!</i>

46:12.458 --> 46:13.791
<i>Just stay with him.</i>

46:14.500 --> 46:17.541
<i>Or else we're gonna keep making</i>
<i>the same mistake!</i>

46:17.625 --> 46:19.291
Hello? Who is this?

46:20.708 --> 46:22.291
Hello? What's going on?

46:32.500 --> 46:33.708
What the hell was that?

46:35.083 --> 46:36.791
One more reason to keep moving.

46:37.208 --> 46:38.041
Yeah.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.166
Becky!

48:26.875 --> 48:27.750
Becky?

48:33.833 --> 48:34.916
Becky!

48:35.000 --> 48:35.833
Beck!

48:35.916 --> 48:36.750
Becky! Beck.

48:36.833 --> 48:37.833
-Becky!
- Wake up!

48:37.916 --> 48:40.041
-Move. Move! Move!
-Hey!

48:40.125 --> 48:42.166
Hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

48:50.916 --> 48:51.875
-Okay.

48:51.958 --> 48:53.541
-No, no, no.
-Come here.

48:53.625 --> 48:54.541
-It's okay.
-Come here.

48:54.625 --> 48:56.041
-Daddy!
-Toby! Oh, thank God.

48:56.125 --> 48:58.166
Toby, thank God! Oh!

49:00.000 --> 49:02.250
-The baby's moving.
-Hey, you okay?

49:02.333 --> 49:06.000
It's probably just her condition
and a touch of heatstroke. That's all.

49:06.083 --> 49:07.083
She's gonna be fine.

49:07.791 --> 49:08.625
We all are.

49:09.250 --> 49:11.583
You're Ross. You're... Tobin's dad.

49:11.666 --> 49:12.958
Yeah.

49:13.041 --> 49:15.208
Hey, don't worry.
Your mother, she's out there.

49:15.291 --> 49:17.708
We're gonna find her,
and then we're leaving.

49:17.791 --> 49:18.666
All of us.

49:19.208 --> 49:20.250
You found a way out?

49:20.666 --> 49:23.875
Yeah, I got to the road, but I wasn't
gonna leave without my family.

49:24.541 --> 49:25.416
How?

49:26.875 --> 49:29.416
Well, it's not a straight line.
I can say that much.

49:29.500 --> 49:32.208
-Which way were you headed?
-Towards that building.

49:32.583 --> 49:34.333
-Building?
-We were almost there.

49:35.833 --> 49:36.750
Come here.

49:37.708 --> 49:40.125
All right, come on.
Up on my shoulders, Tobin.

49:50.250 --> 49:51.333
It's gone.

49:51.958 --> 49:54.250
That's the way
things work around here.

49:54.666 --> 49:57.041
But I got the golden ticket,
for any takers.

50:51.416 --> 50:52.875
Is that CCR?

50:53.791 --> 50:55.250
Well, folk song, originally.

50:57.958 --> 50:59.791
Let me guess. Lead singer in a band?

51:00.958 --> 51:03.500
Four-piece,
with a weekly gig at the local?

51:03.791 --> 51:04.666
-Kinda.
-Hmm.

51:05.750 --> 51:08.416
I'm a good judge of people.
You gotta be, in my field.

51:09.291 --> 51:10.708
Field!

51:12.458 --> 51:14.125
Yeah, real estate's my game.

51:14.958 --> 51:17.833
We were on a little family vacay
through the heartland.

51:18.958 --> 51:21.041
It was going pretty well
till we ran into you.

51:21.500 --> 51:22.458
I...

51:22.875 --> 51:24.041
tried to warn you.

51:24.125 --> 51:26.000
I'm just giving you a hard time,
that's all.

51:29.166 --> 51:30.541
I know it's not your fault.

51:31.041 --> 51:32.125
Fate conspired.

51:33.125 --> 51:35.000
Isn't that always the way?

51:35.708 --> 51:37.708
You know, believe it or not,
before I ended up here,

51:37.791 --> 51:39.958
before, uh, real estate was my game,

51:40.625 --> 51:42.375
I played a mean guitar...

51:43.458 --> 51:44.500
in a gospel band.

51:45.375 --> 51:46.208
Yeah.

51:46.291 --> 51:50.041
Me and my Gibson and Jesus
were gonna rock the world.

51:51.875 --> 51:54.750
But, you know,
got married and had a kid, and...

51:55.500 --> 51:56.916
Those were the days, though.

51:57.291 --> 52:00.875
Still, nothin', but nothin'
compares to this.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
What the hell is it?

52:18.750 --> 52:20.083
See for yourself.

52:23.458 --> 52:24.791
There's carvings on it.

52:26.166 --> 52:27.666
They look really old.

52:28.000 --> 52:28.875
Are those native?

52:28.958 --> 52:31.208
Oh, I think it's a safe bet
it's been here

52:31.291 --> 52:34.041
since before the Kiowa hunted
on the Osage Cuestas.

52:35.791 --> 52:36.750
Older than the hills.

52:37.166 --> 52:42.250
Probably was here before the glaciers came
and carried the hills away.

52:43.083 --> 52:47.166
You realize we're in the center
of the contiguous United States.

52:48.875 --> 52:50.958
Smack-dab in the middle of the continent.

52:51.833 --> 52:55.083
Ah, hell, I'd hazard this stone...

52:56.000 --> 52:58.500
is the center of the center.

52:58.583 --> 53:00.958
We didn't come here
for a goddamn sightseeing tour.

53:02.041 --> 53:03.791
You were gonna show us the way out.

53:05.166 --> 53:07.125
Oh, but darlin', I have.

53:08.041 --> 53:09.166
You just have to look.

53:22.083 --> 53:25.375
Is there a map on it or something?

53:25.458 --> 53:27.833
Just put your hand on it and you'll know.

53:29.041 --> 53:30.500
What's that supposed to mean?

53:45.291 --> 53:46.500
Stop!

53:47.333 --> 53:49.541
- Nat?
-Mommy!

53:50.000 --> 53:51.500
Come here. Oh!

53:51.583 --> 53:52.916
Been looking everywhere for you.

53:54.125 --> 53:57.458
-Thank God you're all right.
-Stay away! Stay away from us!

53:59.583 --> 54:03.083
Whatever he told you,
whatever he said to you, he's lying!

54:03.166 --> 54:05.208
What? What are you talking about?

54:05.791 --> 54:06.750
You know.

54:07.416 --> 54:10.458
All I know, all I care about,
is that we're finally together.

54:10.791 --> 54:12.416
Everything's gonna be
all right now, honey.

54:14.375 --> 54:15.291
Now what is it?

54:18.625 --> 54:20.375
-What is it, honey?
-I saw...

54:21.041 --> 54:21.916
I saw her.

54:22.875 --> 54:23.708
She was...

54:25.083 --> 54:26.041
She was...

54:27.541 --> 54:28.375
She was...

54:29.291 --> 54:30.333
She was what?

54:32.875 --> 54:34.666
She was what? Just say it.

54:35.458 --> 54:36.291
She wasn't...

54:37.000 --> 54:38.458
She wasn't alive.

54:39.958 --> 54:42.458
I saw her on the ground
some ways back.

54:42.541 --> 54:44.000
I saw her, I'm sure.

54:44.083 --> 54:45.458
I'm sure I saw her.

54:46.000 --> 54:46.833
Toby...

54:47.708 --> 54:49.750
Mommy's just a little confused right now.

54:50.291 --> 54:51.416
Why wouldn't she be?

54:51.916 --> 54:53.708
Days without food or water.

54:53.791 --> 54:55.000
I am not confused.

54:55.083 --> 54:57.875
I saw her. I saw her, and you...

54:59.125 --> 55:00.041
You were...

55:00.958 --> 55:02.375
You were gonna...

55:03.708 --> 55:04.708
I was gonna what?

55:06.375 --> 55:08.000
You were gonna hurt me.

55:08.625 --> 55:09.583
Hurt you?

55:10.791 --> 55:12.416
-How could you even think that?

55:12.500 --> 55:13.750
We're all in this together.

55:14.375 --> 55:15.666
We're like a family now.

55:16.291 --> 55:18.083
Right, Travis? We solid?

55:39.541 --> 55:40.541
We have to go.

55:41.125 --> 55:42.250
We have to go.

55:44.333 --> 55:46.458
Look, thanks for your help,
mister, but, uh...

55:47.333 --> 55:49.333
I think we're gonna go
our own way now...

55:51.166 --> 55:52.583
Do you wanna come with us?

55:54.791 --> 55:56.916
No, just a minute. Just hear me out.

55:58.666 --> 55:59.500
This rock,

56:00.208 --> 56:02.458
once you touch it, you'll know.

56:02.833 --> 56:05.041
It's like a... whoosh!

56:05.125 --> 56:06.583
It's... It's better than anything.

56:06.666 --> 56:08.166
It's like accepting the host.

56:08.625 --> 56:11.458
I know that sounds like blasphemy,
but it's true.

56:11.541 --> 56:13.083
You think this is just chance?

56:13.541 --> 56:15.708
Folks are brought into the grass
for a reason.

56:15.791 --> 56:18.625
We're all here
because we've got stuff to work out.

56:19.291 --> 56:21.625
And this rock, in its wisdom,

56:21.708 --> 56:24.625
brought our two families together
to do just that.

56:24.708 --> 56:26.625
All it's asking for is a little faith.

56:27.625 --> 56:32.416
Five little fingers on its face
and you will be redeemed!

56:32.833 --> 56:37.625
All your sins, all your trespasses,
all your regrets will melt away

56:37.708 --> 56:40.000
and the world will open up like a flower!

56:40.375 --> 56:42.125
Oh, it's a beautiful thing.

56:43.041 --> 56:44.666
You gotta trust me on this.

56:49.041 --> 56:50.541
I think you should let her go.

56:54.791 --> 56:55.625
Or what?

57:04.583 --> 57:06.250
Look, you don't have the advantage here.

57:06.791 --> 57:07.916
Is that a threat?

57:09.625 --> 57:10.875
It's pretty simple math.

57:11.333 --> 57:13.208
If you think I was doing the soft sell

57:13.291 --> 57:15.625
because I was afraid
of going the other way,

57:16.666 --> 57:18.250
well, you got another think comin'.

57:18.625 --> 57:20.958
It's better that you come to the rock
on your own.

57:21.041 --> 57:23.208
Open your heart to it, like I did.

57:25.500 --> 57:26.791
Now, what I really wanna know...

57:28.250 --> 57:30.125
is how did you get here?

57:30.541 --> 57:33.916
Because the rock wouldn't let you find us
unless it wanted you to.

57:35.791 --> 57:37.833
Unless this isn't about you.

57:42.041 --> 57:42.916
Right.

57:44.083 --> 57:45.000
I get it.

57:47.083 --> 57:48.500
This is about me.

57:57.291 --> 57:58.666
Looking for the hard sell?

57:59.750 --> 58:00.791
Yeah.

58:00.875 --> 58:01.708
Sure, I'm game.

58:01.791 --> 58:03.208
-Travis!

58:03.291 --> 58:04.208
-No!

58:04.625 --> 58:05.625
-No!
-Go!

58:08.708 --> 58:10.583
-No!
-Go!

58:12.458 --> 58:14.000
Travis!

58:15.875 --> 58:18.000
Stop! Stop!

58:20.041 --> 58:21.875
-Cal! Cal!
-No. Come with--

58:22.291 --> 58:23.416
Cal, help him!

58:23.708 --> 58:25.291
-Please!
-I'm no fibber.

58:26.416 --> 58:30.083
When you touch that rock,
you'll know everything I know.

58:30.166 --> 58:33.000
Everything the grass knows,
including how to leave.

58:33.375 --> 58:35.333
Only, you won't want to.

58:38.333 --> 58:40.166
Tobin! Run! Run!

58:43.291 --> 58:45.625
-Mom! No!
- No!

58:47.166 --> 58:48.875
-No!
-Mommy!

58:48.958 --> 58:50.458
-Mommy!

58:50.541 --> 58:51.583
-No.

58:51.666 --> 58:52.625
Don't worry, son.

58:53.291 --> 58:55.166
-It's just flesh.
- Mommy!

58:55.250 --> 58:57.083
-And all flesh is grass.
-No!

59:04.166 --> 59:05.875
Mommy! No!

59:07.000 --> 59:08.541
Mommy! No!

59:09.458 --> 59:10.458
-Mommy!

59:10.541 --> 59:12.000
Mommy!

59:13.791 --> 59:15.500
Go! Go! Get out!

59:29.333 --> 59:31.000
Save your breath, kids.

59:31.583 --> 59:33.583
You can't run from redemption.

59:36.833 --> 59:39.000
He's right, you know?
Where are we gonna go?

59:41.000 --> 59:41.875
Freddy!

59:41.958 --> 59:42.791
Come on!

59:56.875 --> 59:58.708
Come on! Hurry!

01:00:04.833 --> 01:00:05.666
Cal!

01:00:17.625 --> 01:00:18.791
What are we gonna do?

01:00:19.333 --> 01:00:21.375
He'll find us. For sure, he'll find us.

01:00:21.458 --> 01:00:23.333
Listen to me.
First thing we have to do

01:00:23.416 --> 01:00:24.875
is you need to take hold of my hand.

01:00:24.958 --> 01:00:25.958
It's okay, Tobin.

01:00:26.041 --> 01:00:28.416
My daddy's right. We're grass.

01:00:28.833 --> 01:00:30.583
We keep dying and coming back.

01:00:30.666 --> 01:00:32.916
-Like Freddy did.
-One, two...

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:37.833
Here.

01:00:39.458 --> 01:00:41.291
- Come here.

01:00:41.708 --> 01:00:43.166
-Come here.

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:45.541
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:00:45.625 --> 01:00:46.875
-Okay.

01:00:47.666 --> 01:00:50.291
-I didn't know what to do.
-Yeah, you sure didn't.

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.958
Well, we wouldn't be in this mess
if it wasn't for you.

01:00:55.041 --> 01:00:57.708
Okay, blaming each other
isn't gonna solve anything.

01:00:57.791 --> 01:01:00.875
Well, all indicators are
that there's no way to solve this.

01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:03.208
If we're just gonna go
round and round in circles,

01:01:03.291 --> 01:01:05.708
I'll feel a lot better saying
what we all know.

01:01:06.041 --> 01:01:07.458
It's not that simple.

01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:09.958
Are you forgetting the detail
that he completely abandoned you?

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.708
That he totally threw you away?

01:01:11.791 --> 01:01:13.916
That he wanted you
to abort your own baby?

01:01:18.458 --> 01:01:19.416
Becky...

01:01:20.208 --> 01:01:21.875
I'm sorry.

01:01:23.458 --> 01:01:25.291
-I just wanted...
-You just wanted to what?

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:27.958
Look after me?

01:01:28.541 --> 01:01:29.625
Protect me?

01:01:30.125 --> 01:01:31.166
I need food.

01:01:31.458 --> 01:01:33.666
I need water. I need a place to sleep.

01:01:34.166 --> 01:01:36.875
What I don't need
is any more brotherly love.

01:01:39.041 --> 01:01:41.041
No. Cal's right.

01:01:41.833 --> 01:01:42.916
I was an asshole.

01:01:43.791 --> 01:01:45.250
And I made a mistake.

01:01:45.916 --> 01:01:46.916
A big one.

01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:50.625
But that's not the real reason
you don't like me.

01:01:50.958 --> 01:01:52.125
-Is it, Cal?

01:01:53.041 --> 01:01:54.125
It's a good start.

01:01:54.208 --> 01:01:57.375
No, it's a good excuse,
but it's not the reason.

01:01:57.458 --> 01:02:00.208
You didn't want me around
even before there was a baby.

01:02:00.291 --> 01:02:01.875
The truth is, there's nothing

01:02:02.333 --> 01:02:03.958
that I could have done
to make you like me,

01:02:04.041 --> 01:02:07.000
because no one is ever gonna be
good enough for your little sister.

01:02:07.083 --> 01:02:09.250
-A high school diploma would be nice.
-You know what?

01:02:09.333 --> 01:02:11.250
I'm not quite the fuckup
that you think I am!

01:02:11.333 --> 01:02:14.750
Oh, no. No, no. You're a real rock star.

01:02:14.833 --> 01:02:18.541
You've sacrificed everything
for that ridiculous, infantile fantasy,

01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:20.375
and now we're all suffering for it.

01:02:20.458 --> 01:02:21.416
And you're a real hero.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:23.208
Playing hubby to your little sister?

01:02:23.291 --> 01:02:26.458
That's the next best thing to fucking her,
which is what you really want, isn't it?

01:02:26.958 --> 01:02:28.208
Guys, stop it!

01:02:29.083 --> 01:02:29.958
Stop it!

01:02:30.625 --> 01:02:31.500
Stop it!

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.041
Open up!

01:02:37.125 --> 01:02:38.083
Come on, this way!

01:02:40.166 --> 01:02:41.583
Redemption is coming!

01:02:41.666 --> 01:02:42.916
-Come on.

01:02:59.333 --> 01:03:00.166
You okay?

01:03:01.291 --> 01:03:02.166
Come on, hurry!

01:03:03.291 --> 01:03:04.291
-Get the door!
- Yeah.

01:03:07.833 --> 01:03:08.708
Okay.

01:03:09.041 --> 01:03:11.208
He's not gonna get through that
without a sledgehammer.

01:03:11.291 --> 01:03:12.958
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:16.666
What are we gonna do? We're stuck up here!

01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:20.291
No, listen to me. When I drove here,
I saw this building from the road.

01:03:20.375 --> 01:03:21.791
We saw it, too.

01:03:21.875 --> 01:03:24.333
Yeah. The church,
it was just on the other side.

01:03:25.458 --> 01:03:26.291
Okay.

01:03:27.833 --> 01:03:29.166
-Are you okay?
-Mm-hmm.

01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:30.208
Yeah, it's fine.

01:03:33.708 --> 01:03:35.708
My God, there it is.

01:03:36.625 --> 01:03:37.791
Spitting distance.

01:03:38.333 --> 01:03:41.791
Only thing is, we go in that grass again
and we're back to square one.

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:48.083
Freddy?

01:03:50.333 --> 01:03:52.166
Fucking dog gives me the creeps.

01:03:55.916 --> 01:03:56.833
Where'd he go?

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:14.958
There, on the road.

01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:19.083
A hole.

01:04:20.541 --> 01:04:21.375
There's a hole.

01:04:21.458 --> 01:04:23.583
The way out? You think that's it?

01:04:23.666 --> 01:04:25.958
Maybe. But we're not there yet--

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:50.083
Tobin.

01:04:54.791 --> 01:04:55.708
Tobin, I...

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:04.875
Becky, we've gotta get out of here.

01:05:07.166 --> 01:05:08.208
Where's Travis?

01:05:09.875 --> 01:05:10.708
He's coming.

01:05:14.333 --> 01:05:16.500
Holes are everywhere, Calvin, my boy.

01:05:20.666 --> 01:05:22.000
Life's full of 'em!

01:05:25.666 --> 01:05:26.875
Tobin, come back!

01:05:27.916 --> 01:05:30.083
-Travis!
<i>-</i> Beck, we have to keep moving!

01:05:30.166 --> 01:05:31.583
We can't just leave!

01:05:31.666 --> 01:05:33.791
I'll come back for him,
but we have to get you out!

01:05:33.875 --> 01:05:36.083
I found a way. It's... It's right there.

01:05:36.791 --> 01:05:37.625
Travis!

01:05:37.708 --> 01:05:39.166
-We're so close!
-Travis!

01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:40.208
Beck, I'm your brother,

01:05:40.291 --> 01:05:43.333
and I'm telling you right now
to forget about that asshole.

01:05:49.541 --> 01:05:50.750
Did you do something?

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:53.916
Beck.

01:05:54.875 --> 01:05:55.708
I love you.

01:05:55.791 --> 01:05:57.166
-Get away from me.
-Beck.

01:05:57.583 --> 01:05:58.416
-No, wait.

01:05:58.500 --> 01:05:59.708
-Beck, wait.
-No...

01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:01.125
-Beck, please.
-No...

01:06:01.208 --> 01:06:02.791
Please, Beck. Wait.

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:06.291
Thought that you would lose your sister
when you got out of here.

01:06:06.375 --> 01:06:09.833
That the baby would bring her and Travis
together, you'd be left out in the cold.

01:06:10.291 --> 01:06:12.333
You're probably right on that score.

01:06:12.416 --> 01:06:14.625
Your mistake is thinking
you're ever leaving.

01:06:29.416 --> 01:06:31.333
-I'm impressed. Yeah.

01:06:32.041 --> 01:06:34.291
Of course, I was a bit of a track star
back in the day.

01:06:34.875 --> 01:06:36.250
Played some ball, too.

01:06:36.333 --> 01:06:38.375
- I know.

01:06:38.458 --> 01:06:39.833
I know. I know.

01:06:40.541 --> 01:06:44.333
You're thinking if you had just
turned left instead of right,

01:06:44.416 --> 01:06:45.791
you could've gotten away from me.

01:06:45.875 --> 01:06:47.000
But you did go left,

01:06:47.583 --> 01:06:49.333
-and you turned right.

01:06:49.416 --> 01:06:51.208
And you kept running
and didn't turn at all.

01:06:52.833 --> 01:06:53.708
But here,

01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:57.416
in the garden of forking paths,

01:06:58.250 --> 01:06:59.750
you didn't make any one choice.

01:07:01.166 --> 01:07:02.416
You made every choice.

01:07:03.541 --> 01:07:04.916
And they all led back to me.

01:07:37.208 --> 01:07:38.166
Travis?

01:07:40.166 --> 01:07:41.208
Travis!

01:07:43.166 --> 01:07:44.000
Becky?

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.041
Becky?

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:00.208
Becky?

01:08:04.083 --> 01:08:05.208
Becky?

01:08:13.083 --> 01:08:13.958
Becky?

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:15.916
Travis?

01:08:16.832 --> 01:08:17.666
You okay?

01:08:20.416 --> 01:08:21.416
I'm scared.

01:08:23.082 --> 01:08:24.707
Travis, where are you?

01:08:26.666 --> 01:08:27.916
What happened?

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:28.916
Your brother...

01:08:33.666 --> 01:08:35.625
I think he loves you a little too much.

01:08:36.832 --> 01:08:38.250
But this isn't his fault.

01:08:40.332 --> 01:08:41.250
I did this.

01:08:44.082 --> 01:08:46.332
I had my chance with you,
and I threw it away.

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:49.332
Whatever happens...

01:08:50.582 --> 01:08:51.750
I want you to know I...

01:08:52.582 --> 01:08:54.250
I'm glad you didn't listen to me.

01:08:56.707 --> 01:08:57.957
I'm glad you kept Ginny.

01:09:04.707 --> 01:09:05.582
Becky?

01:09:10.666 --> 01:09:11.500
There's, um...

01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:18.457
There's something I didn't tell you.

01:09:22.916 --> 01:09:24.375
I was gonna give her up.

01:09:25.666 --> 01:09:27.041
I got scared.

01:09:29.707 --> 01:09:31.666
I didn't think I was ready to be a mom.

01:09:33.166 --> 01:09:36.416
That's why we were, um,
going to San Diego.

01:09:38.582 --> 01:09:40.125
There was a family there.

01:09:40.625 --> 01:09:42.582
-You don't want that anymore?

01:09:44.207 --> 01:09:46.082
What difference does it make now?

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:48.916
We're gonna get out of here.

01:09:49.457 --> 01:09:51.957
I'm gonna find a way.
Our baby deserves to live.

01:09:53.582 --> 01:09:55.416
She's a strong one.

01:09:58.041 --> 01:09:59.541
I feel her kicking.

01:10:02.291 --> 01:10:04.333
I wish I could just touch your hand.

01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:06.500
It's right here.

01:10:15.833 --> 01:10:16.708
-Becky?

01:10:16.791 --> 01:10:17.916
Get away from me!

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.083
-Becky, what's going on?

01:10:23.208 --> 01:10:26.791
How funny. This is where I tussled
with Natalie for the first time.

01:10:26.875 --> 01:10:29.583
I tried to show her the way,
but she just wouldn't listen.

01:10:29.666 --> 01:10:31.208
-Come on.

01:10:37.666 --> 01:10:39.750
You wanna touch the rock, darlin'?

01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:41.125
Huh?

01:10:43.333 --> 01:10:44.791
You wanna lay on it naked?

01:10:45.791 --> 01:10:47.291
Wanna feel me in you?

01:10:48.458 --> 01:10:51.333
Beneath the pinwheel stars

01:10:51.416 --> 01:10:54.875
while the grass sings our names?

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.208
It's poetry, huh?

01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:02.541
Blood is nice,

01:11:04.208 --> 01:11:09.208
but tears are better
for an old, thirsty rock like that.

01:11:12.291 --> 01:11:14.125
-It has to be quick, though.

01:11:14.416 --> 01:11:16.208
Don't wanna do it in front of the kid.

01:12:53.416 --> 01:12:55.958
No! No!

01:13:01.041 --> 01:13:02.291
No!

01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:06.416
Travis!

01:14:11.291 --> 01:14:12.250
Travis!

01:14:25.708 --> 01:14:26.833
<i>Hello?</i>

01:14:27.625 --> 01:14:29.083
Listen to me.

01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:32.916
Don't let Cal hurt Travis.

01:14:35.166 --> 01:14:36.291
Don't leave him.

01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:38.541
Just stay with him.

01:14:39.416 --> 01:14:42.541
Or else we're gonna keep making
the same mistakes forever.

01:14:42.625 --> 01:14:43.708
<i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

01:14:43.791 --> 01:14:45.666
<i>-Hello? What's going on?</i>

01:16:56.583 --> 01:16:58.291
Baby... Baby...

01:16:59.125 --> 01:17:00.125
Little baby...

01:17:01.125 --> 01:17:02.375
Baby...

01:17:02.958 --> 01:17:04.166
-It's okay.
-Baby...

01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:05.750
Here, here, here, here.

01:17:09.333 --> 01:17:10.958
-No, not too fast.

01:17:11.041 --> 01:17:12.291
I don't want you to get sick.

01:17:14.416 --> 01:17:16.333
-May I have a look? My baby?
-It's okay.

01:17:16.416 --> 01:17:18.291
-I've got her. I've got her.
-Baby...

01:17:19.083 --> 01:17:20.166
She's right here.

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:23.500
I've got her.

01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:25.625
Isn't she great?

01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:30.208
Out of the oven and baked just right.

01:17:31.625 --> 01:17:33.041
Aren't you the Mother Mary?

01:17:33.833 --> 01:17:36.666
Wonder when the Wise Men will come.

01:17:38.791 --> 01:17:40.791
I wonder what gifts they'll have for us.

01:17:42.916 --> 01:17:43.875
Hmm...

01:17:56.375 --> 01:17:59.750
There once was a farmer from Leeds

01:18:00.041 --> 01:18:03.541
Who swallowed a bag full of seeds

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:08.750
-Big bunches of grass...
-Mm.

01:18:09.458 --> 01:18:11.416
-...sprouted out of his ass...

01:18:11.875 --> 01:18:14.291
And his balls...

01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:17.416
-grew all shaggy with weeds
-Mm.

01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:20.208
Mm. Mm.

01:18:21.416 --> 01:18:23.125
Mm...

01:18:24.916 --> 01:18:26.875
Cal...

01:18:28.416 --> 01:18:29.375
What is that?

01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:32.208
What am I eating?

01:18:32.291 --> 01:18:33.333
Grass.

01:18:33.916 --> 01:18:35.208
It's just grass.

01:18:37.291 --> 01:18:39.583
And seeds and so on.

01:18:39.958 --> 01:18:41.041
-Mm.

01:18:43.291 --> 01:18:45.041
Cows do it all the time.

01:18:53.958 --> 01:18:55.041
Here's another piece.

01:18:55.125 --> 01:18:55.958
Mm.

01:18:56.041 --> 01:18:57.333
-It's good for you.
-Mm.

01:18:58.166 --> 01:18:59.541
It's good for your soul.

01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:05.625
Mm.

01:19:06.916 --> 01:19:07.791
Mm.

01:19:07.875 --> 01:19:09.541
- Yeah.
-Mm.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:11.875
You ate it all.

01:19:12.541 --> 01:19:13.416
Yeah.

01:19:14.791 --> 01:19:15.958
That's a good girl.

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:17.416
It tastes like...

01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:20.708
Like what?

01:19:24.041 --> 01:19:24.875
Like...

01:19:26.250 --> 01:19:27.125
Like...

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:30.333
You?

01:19:39.791 --> 01:19:40.666
Becky?

01:19:44.041 --> 01:19:45.000
Becky!

01:20:00.166 --> 01:20:01.000
Becky?

01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:15.583
Baby.

01:20:18.166 --> 01:20:19.000
Baby.

01:20:27.416 --> 01:20:28.625
Oh, no.

01:20:32.416 --> 01:20:33.333
Oh.

01:20:38.833 --> 01:20:40.083
Oh, please.

01:20:42.666 --> 01:20:43.958
Please, no.

01:20:44.375 --> 01:20:46.041
My daddy killed the baby.

01:20:48.125 --> 01:20:49.291
I know he did.

01:20:52.375 --> 01:20:53.583
I found Cal.

01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:56.750
He killed him, too.

01:20:58.666 --> 01:21:00.541
This is never gonna stop.

01:21:01.416 --> 01:21:03.666
He's gonna keep killing us over...

01:21:04.208 --> 01:21:05.250
and over...

01:21:05.708 --> 01:21:07.041
and over again.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.125
And it's never gonna stop.

01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:19.375
I'm not gonna let him hurt you.

01:21:21.833 --> 01:21:24.000
But he's watching us right now.

01:21:34.416 --> 01:21:35.666
You out there, Ross?

01:21:38.791 --> 01:21:39.916
Why hide?

01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:41.666
Huh?

01:21:43.083 --> 01:21:44.583
If you wanna finish us,

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.791
then just do it already!

01:21:50.083 --> 01:21:51.083
I'm here!

01:21:52.166 --> 01:21:53.041
You see?

01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:54.750
I'm waiting!

01:21:54.833 --> 01:21:56.500
- Travis!

01:21:57.208 --> 01:21:58.333
No.

01:21:58.416 --> 01:21:59.250
I don't see.

01:21:59.666 --> 01:22:00.833
Your honey took my eye out.

01:22:02.833 --> 01:22:03.791
But you know what?

01:22:04.416 --> 01:22:06.041
Eyes are deceiving around here.

01:22:06.416 --> 01:22:07.750
I'm better off without it.

01:22:10.833 --> 01:22:11.666
Dad!

01:22:15.291 --> 01:22:17.375
Too bad, kid. I liked ya.

01:22:17.458 --> 01:22:18.958
Saw a seed of myself in there.

01:22:21.916 --> 01:22:23.083
Dad, no!

01:22:33.958 --> 01:22:35.333
No, Dad. No!

01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:40.958
All I wanted...

01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:43.250
was to help you find redemption.

01:22:46.125 --> 01:22:47.375
- Stop!

01:22:47.458 --> 01:22:50.166
God knows you're the one
who needed it the most.

01:22:51.875 --> 01:22:53.083
Maybe next time.

01:22:58.500 --> 01:22:59.875
Travis!

01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:02.875
Ready for yours?

01:23:07.083 --> 01:23:08.208
No!

01:23:10.291 --> 01:23:11.416
Gorgeous, isn't she?

01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:15.000
-No!
-It wants you to touch it.

01:23:16.083 --> 01:23:17.375
This field needs it.

01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:20.208
More than the rain.

01:23:21.375 --> 01:23:22.666
It's so easy, son.

01:23:22.750 --> 01:23:25.958
-Redemption is so very, very easy.

01:24:12.541 --> 01:24:14.625
I'm not coming back here!

01:24:17.291 --> 01:24:18.708
And neither are you!

01:26:25.583 --> 01:26:26.958
Travis, don't.

01:26:28.708 --> 01:26:30.500
Don't. No. No. No!

01:26:31.458 --> 01:26:32.541
No!

01:26:32.625 --> 01:26:33.708
If you touch it...

01:26:34.750 --> 01:26:36.166
you'll never leave.

01:27:34.375 --> 01:27:35.291
Travis?

01:27:43.166 --> 01:27:44.208
Follow me.

01:28:14.291 --> 01:28:15.458
I'm not leaving.

01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:20.666
But you...

01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:25.291
you don't belong here.

01:28:26.291 --> 01:28:27.500
And neither does Becky.

01:28:31.333 --> 01:28:32.541
Don't let them in.

01:28:37.875 --> 01:28:39.000
<i>Don't let them in, Tobin.</i>

01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:57.083
Help!

01:29:57.875 --> 01:29:58.708
Hello?

01:29:59.583 --> 01:30:00.875
Is someone out there?

01:30:00.958 --> 01:30:02.625
Help!

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.375
I'm lost in here.

01:30:05.208 --> 01:30:06.750
Sounds like he's really in trouble.

01:30:06.833 --> 01:30:08.708
I've been trying to get to the road,

01:30:08.791 --> 01:30:10.416
-but I can't find it!

01:30:12.291 --> 01:30:13.125
Okay.

01:30:13.833 --> 01:30:14.875
We better haul him out.

01:30:15.208 --> 01:30:17.083
No! Don't go in there!

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:21.125
Wait! No!

01:30:22.625 --> 01:30:23.708
Don't go in there!

01:30:23.791 --> 01:30:25.666
Stay away from it. Stay away.

01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:27.041
Are you okay?

01:30:27.125 --> 01:30:28.083
Help!

01:30:28.166 --> 01:30:29.125
Wasn't he just...

01:30:29.458 --> 01:30:30.708
Didn't we hear him...

01:30:31.208 --> 01:30:32.958
Help!

01:30:34.416 --> 01:30:35.666
Don't listen to him.

01:30:36.041 --> 01:30:37.583
Get back in the car. You have to go.

01:30:37.666 --> 01:30:39.833
-Kid, where are your parents?
-It doesn't matter. Please.

01:30:39.916 --> 01:30:41.958
-We just have to go. Get in the car.
-Okay.

01:30:42.041 --> 01:30:44.375
- I can't find my way out!
-What do we do?

01:30:44.458 --> 01:30:46.291
I mean,
it sure sounds like he's in trouble.

01:30:46.375 --> 01:30:48.541
No. No! No, don't let him go in!

01:30:48.625 --> 01:30:52.083
If he goes in, you'll go in
and you'll never get out.

01:30:52.166 --> 01:30:53.458
-Please!
-Okay...

01:30:55.333 --> 01:30:56.166
Please.

01:30:58.166 --> 01:30:59.541
Are you coming?

01:31:01.291 --> 01:31:02.541
Help me!

01:31:02.625 --> 01:31:04.791
-Where did you get this?
-Travis.

01:31:07.958 --> 01:31:09.291
Cal, wait!

01:31:10.375 --> 01:31:11.666
Get back here right now.

01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:14.166
Hey! Don't leave!

01:31:14.250 --> 01:31:15.291
Look.

01:31:17.541 --> 01:31:19.666
He said he got this from Travis.

01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:20.791
Travis?

01:31:20.875 --> 01:31:22.458
I'll explain later, I promise.

01:31:22.541 --> 01:31:24.666
But right now, we have to go. Please.

01:31:25.208 --> 01:31:26.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:31:26.583 --> 01:31:27.583
-Hey.

01:31:27.666 --> 01:31:28.500
Are you okay?

01:31:28.583 --> 01:31:30.208
We have to go.

01:31:31.166 --> 01:31:32.208
What about the kid?
