01:03.561 --> 01:05.479
Hey.
- Hey, you're almost late.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.079
Are you trying to make me
nervous...

01:07.080 --> 01:08.639
- Yeah, whatever, Dave.
I'm here, okay?

01:08.640 --> 01:10.639
- What... what's with the hand?
- Nothing, I'm fine.

01:10.640 --> 01:12.359
- Do you know
how serious this is?

01:12.360 --> 01:13.919
They only have one spot to fill.

01:13.920 --> 01:15.839
I had to do a lot of talking
to get them to see you.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.359
I had to explain
what you've been doing

01:17.360 --> 01:18.639
since you graduated.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.319
- I've been stocking shelves
at Price Mart.

01:20.320 --> 01:21.441
Does that embarrass you?

01:21.442 --> 01:23.080
- Whoa!
Whoa.

01:23.081 --> 01:27.200
Okay, sorry.
Sorry, I'm just...

01:27.201 --> 01:29.199
Look, I don't think
I can do this, actually.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.441
I think I'm gonna go.

01:30.442 --> 01:32.560
- Eli, Eli!
- What?

01:32.561 --> 01:34.360
- You're the one, E.

01:38.001 --> 01:40.360
<i>- I'm the one what, Dave?</i>

01:40.361 --> 01:43.121
<i>You believe in me,
but you're delusional.</i>

01:43.122 --> 01:44.680
<i>And you have no idea</i>

01:44.681 --> 01:46.841
<i>of the shit
I put myself through today</i>

01:46.842 --> 01:48.480
<i>just to get here.</i>

01:55.481 --> 01:57.841
<i>I should have gone to bed
early last night,</i>

01:57.842 --> 01:59.880
<i>rest up for my audition,</i>

01:59.881 --> 02:00.961
<i>or at least practice.</i>

02:02.801 --> 02:05.199
<i>Yeah, but some jock assholes
were having a party</i>

02:05.200 --> 02:06.839
<i>in the neighborhood,
and, well,</i>

02:06.840 --> 02:07.921
<i>no one invited me...</i>

02:07.922 --> 02:10.440
<i>so I showed up.</i>

02:10.441 --> 02:12.920
Yes! Yes!
Suck it.

02:14.321 --> 02:15.799
No, no, round three,
round three!

02:15.800 --> 02:18.039
Round three!
All right, all right!

02:18.040 --> 02:19.039
- Come on, come on!

02:19.040 --> 02:20.079
- You're not in the game!

02:20.080 --> 02:21.599
You're not in the game!

02:21.600 --> 02:23.879
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What's your problem, man?

02:23.880 --> 02:24.959
You're making a mess!

02:24.960 --> 02:26.239
- One second, okay?
One second.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.479
One second.
One second.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.239
- I said you're making a mess.

02:29.240 --> 02:30.559
- And I heard, I heard,
but listen,

02:30.560 --> 02:31.881
get a towel
and clean it up, okay?

02:31.882 --> 02:33.120
I'll owe you.

02:33.121 --> 02:34.719
- No, no, no,
you're coming with me.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.561
- You're the one
spilling everywhere.

02:36.562 --> 02:37.560
- You're done.

02:37.561 --> 02:38.559
Nobody likes you.

02:38.560 --> 02:39.879
- Fuck you, seriously.

02:39.880 --> 02:41.039
- Get the hell out of my house!

02:41.040 --> 02:42.239
- No, dude, no.
I'm still here.

02:42.240 --> 02:44.041
- I said, get the hell
out of my house!

02:44.042 --> 02:46.880
- Hey, relax, dude!
Relax.

02:46.881 --> 02:48.079
Eli, are you okay?
- Yeah.

02:50.162 --> 02:52.920
Oh, God,
what the hell's that?

02:52.921 --> 02:53.999
Yo, yo, yo, watch it!

02:54.000 --> 02:55.599
Hey, yo.
Hey, asshole, get out of here.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.321
- Chill out, man.
Nobody wants you here.

02:58.521 --> 02:59.641
- Sorry.

03:19.081 --> 03:21.361
- Eli.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.119
- Eli is a train wreck.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.641
And I like it!
- Shut up.

03:36.642 --> 03:37.960
- Oh, God.

03:37.961 --> 03:39.161
- No, I'm fine.

03:56.881 --> 03:57.920
- Okay.

03:57.921 --> 04:00.000
- You're done.
Get up.

04:00.001 --> 04:01.760
Get up!

04:01.761 --> 04:03.001
- Sorry about that.

04:07.121 --> 04:08.360
- Careful!

04:08.361 --> 04:11.160
- I am okay.

04:11.161 --> 04:13.161
The ground is, like,
moving around a little bit.

04:13.162 --> 04:14.680
- You're good.

04:14.681 --> 04:16.120
- Eli!

04:16.120 --> 04:17.760
Mr. Badass Piano Man.

04:18.761 --> 04:20.440
- All right, all right...

04:20.442 --> 04:23.520
I'll see you...
- I shall see you soon.

04:23.521 --> 04:24.840
Bye, guys.

04:24.841 --> 04:28.200
Take your pants off
and use protection, okay?

04:28.201 --> 04:29.599
- How are you?
Are you okay?

04:29.600 --> 04:30.601
- Yeah, I'm great.

04:30.602 --> 04:31.720
How you doing?

04:31.721 --> 04:33.200
- I'm... I'm okay,

04:33.201 --> 04:34.359
but I didn't just puke

04:34.360 --> 04:36.201
while I was playing
beautiful music.

04:37.441 --> 04:38.640
- Thanks.

04:38.641 --> 04:41.039
Yeah, I think the beer
was stale or something.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.519
I think that's
what did it.

04:42.520 --> 04:43.719
- Sure, all right.

04:43.720 --> 04:44.881
We'll call it that.

04:44.882 --> 04:47.120
Are you gonna drive home?

04:47.121 --> 04:48.561
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm drinking water.

04:48.562 --> 04:50.960
I'm sobering up.

04:50.961 --> 04:52.200
- Eli...

04:52.201 --> 04:53.719
- I'm fine, really, seriously.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.919
I'll wait it out
for a few minutes here.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.401
I'm good, but thank you.

04:57.402 --> 04:58.880
- Okay, yeah.
Okay.

04:58.881 --> 05:01.040
- Okay.

05:01.041 --> 05:05.080
- Uh, so... what else is new?

05:05.081 --> 05:06.600
- What's new?
- Yeah.

05:09.721 --> 05:11.761
There's a two-for-one sale
on saltines.

05:11.762 --> 05:13.120
Okay.

05:13.121 --> 05:14.720
- It's $2.85.

05:14.721 --> 05:16.801
There's a 24-pack of water
that's $4.49.

05:16.802 --> 05:18.080
- No!
- Mm-hmm.

05:18.081 --> 05:19.880
- Wow.
Wow!

05:19.881 --> 05:21.039
- I stock all that shit.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.281
You don't have to tell me.

05:22.282 --> 05:23.560
- Okay.

05:23.561 --> 05:25.800
- How about you?
How's, um...

05:25.801 --> 05:27.160
how's school?

05:27.161 --> 05:28.440
- It's good.

05:28.441 --> 05:30.361
I didn't get as good of grades
as I wanted,

05:30.362 --> 05:31.520
but, um...

05:31.521 --> 05:32.919
I'm getting a good internship

05:32.920 --> 05:35.039
from my anthropology teacher,
so...

05:35.040 --> 05:36.321
- That sounds nice.

05:36.322 --> 05:39.680
What's "not too well,"
like, 3.8?

05:41.401 --> 05:43.640
It's a...
3.6 G-point average.

05:43.641 --> 05:45.600
- Oh.
Letting yourself go.

05:45.601 --> 05:47.600
3.6?
- Mm-hmm.

05:47.601 --> 05:50.799
- You too busy fending off
boys or something to focus?

05:50.800 --> 05:51.919
- What are you doing?

05:51.920 --> 05:52.921
You need to stop.

05:52.922 --> 05:54.120
- Sorry.

05:54.121 --> 05:56.400
Sorry.

05:56.401 --> 05:59.000
I'm an asshole.
I forgot, sorry.

05:59.001 --> 06:00.201
Anyway, it was good to, um...

06:00.202 --> 06:02.120
Okay, I gotta go.

06:02.121 --> 06:04.800
Oh, there's a checkpoint
on 28th,

06:04.801 --> 06:06.960
so drive carefully,
all right?

06:06.961 --> 06:08.720
- All right.

06:42.762 --> 06:44.320
Mom?
Mom, are you up?

06:44.321 --> 06:47.200
We gotta be out
in five minutes, okay?

06:47.201 --> 06:51.401
<i>♪ That it would take
more than I have ♪</i>

06:53.161 --> 06:55.240
All right, looks good.

06:55.241 --> 06:57.001
Nicole, you gotta
eat quickly today, okay?

06:57.002 --> 06:58.200
We're in a hurry.

06:58.201 --> 06:59.839
Nicole's not hungry.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.439
- Okay, Nicole, you gotta eat.

07:01.440 --> 07:03.079
Nicole's not hungry!

07:03.080 --> 07:04.841
- Two bites,
then get your stuff together.

07:04.842 --> 07:06.440
Hey, Mom!

07:06.441 --> 07:08.521
I'm not hungry!

07:08.522 --> 07:10.000
- Mom!
Let's go!

07:10.001 --> 07:12.361
Day one of rehab starts today.
28 to go.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.841
Whoa.

07:18.441 --> 07:19.920
That's new.

07:19.921 --> 07:21.680
- Isis,

07:21.681 --> 07:23.800
goddess of motherhood.

07:23.801 --> 07:25.519
- The goddess of motherhood.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.519
That's good; that's, uh...
that's relevant.

07:27.520 --> 07:28.999
That's just like you, right?

07:29.000 --> 07:31.481
- I just wanted to finish it
before I, uh... leave.

07:31.482 --> 07:32.800
- Good, it's good.

07:32.801 --> 07:34.279
You're really
hitting your stride.

07:34.280 --> 07:37.201
I think you'll be
gallery material in no time.

07:38.561 --> 07:40.760
What's with the jacket?

07:40.761 --> 07:42.600
Huh?

07:42.601 --> 07:44.039
You look like you're headed off

07:44.040 --> 07:45.721
to a Young Republicans'
convention.

07:46.921 --> 07:49.401
- I just...
I wanted to look good...

07:49.402 --> 07:51.640
uh, for you.

07:51.641 --> 07:53.240
- Lose it.

07:53.241 --> 07:55.480
Doesn't look good on you.

07:55.481 --> 07:58.560
- All right,
thanks for the fashion tip.

07:58.561 --> 08:00.599
You told work
you were taking off?

08:00.600 --> 08:03.919
- Yeah, I told them I was
taking you guys to Disneyland.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.121
- Disneyland's the one
in California, so...

08:06.122 --> 08:07.920
- What?

08:07.921 --> 08:09.080
- Nothing.

08:09.081 --> 08:10.480
You ready?

08:10.481 --> 08:12.360
- Yeah.
You?

08:12.361 --> 08:14.121
- Let's go.
After you.

08:17.921 --> 08:19.880
- Hope you have everything.

08:19.881 --> 08:21.239
Okay, and you have Julio, right?

08:21.240 --> 08:22.399
- Yep.
- You have Julio.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.719
- Okay, then let's go.
Let's go.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.079
- He's gotta go to camp too,
right?

08:25.080 --> 08:26.919
You going to be nice
to the other children?

08:26.920 --> 08:27.921
Yes.

08:27.922 --> 08:30.240
- Okay, I love you, Julio.

08:30.241 --> 08:32.239
- All right, you got everything?
You have your ID?

08:32.240 --> 08:33.679
You have
your social security card?

08:33.679 --> 08:35.239
- One, two, three,
whoopsy-daisy.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.279
- Clean underwear?
- Yeah, calm down.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.399
What's got into you?

08:38.400 --> 08:39.520
Buckle up.

08:39.522 --> 08:40.799
- Oh.

08:40.801 --> 08:42.479
- Ah, yes.
Thank you, Julio.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.039
Emergency brake's still on.
- What?

08:44.039 --> 08:46.441
- The emergency brake.
- Oh, the emergency brake's on.

08:46.442 --> 08:50.600
Park in this driveway
without an emergency brake.

08:50.601 --> 08:51.799
Why are you so nervous?

08:51.800 --> 08:53.439
I'm the one who
should be nervous, not you.

08:53.440 --> 08:55.039
- Yeah, I have a lot
on my mind, all right?

08:55.040 --> 08:56.279
I have a life too, okay?

08:56.280 --> 08:57.959
Hey, Nicole, listen,
don't get into a fight

08:57.960 --> 08:59.439
with anybody today,
and don't spit.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.359
- She's an angel.
Aren't ya, honey?

09:01.360 --> 09:03.599
- Yeah, I know.
She's an angel who spits.

09:03.600 --> 09:04.879
- Hey, hey, hang on.

09:04.880 --> 09:05.999
I'll take her in today.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.639
- No, no, come on, Mom,
just say good-bye.

09:07.640 --> 09:08.679
We're gonna be late.

09:08.680 --> 09:09.759
- Late?
Who cares?

09:09.760 --> 09:11.119
I just want
to walk my daughter in.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.319
- Come on, Coley, let's go.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.441
- Come on, sweetie.

09:13.442 --> 09:15.000
That's a girl.

09:15.001 --> 09:17.040
Coley...

09:17.041 --> 09:19.399
You know how much
I love you, right?

09:19.400 --> 09:20.441
Yes.

09:20.442 --> 09:21.800
- Oh.

09:21.801 --> 09:23.881
You okay with me going away
for a little while?

09:23.882 --> 09:26.480
Got some stuff I need
some help with.

09:26.481 --> 09:27.681
Are you sick?

09:27.682 --> 09:29.000
- No.
- Yes.

09:29.001 --> 09:30.200
- I'm fine.

09:30.201 --> 09:33.160
Don't... don't worry, okay?

09:33.161 --> 09:35.480
And Eli's gonna
take care of you.

09:35.481 --> 09:37.479
- Yeah, yeah, of course, Coley.
It's gonna be fun.

09:37.480 --> 09:38.839
We're gonna have a blast.

09:38.840 --> 09:41.321
We'll have pillow forts
and ice cream every night.

09:41.322 --> 09:44.680
- I am gonna miss you, baby.

09:44.681 --> 09:46.840
- All right.
Okay.

09:46.841 --> 09:48.160
- I love you guys.

09:48.161 --> 09:49.921
- Okay, we love you.
Come on, come on, Coley.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.360
- You have fun!

09:51.361 --> 09:53.479
- Good, and try to be nice
to the other kids today, okay?

09:53.480 --> 09:54.519
- I will.
- Okay, good.

09:54.520 --> 09:55.839
You were so good last week.

09:55.840 --> 09:57.599
- Hey, Nicole, why don't you
go ahead inside?

09:57.600 --> 09:59.681
I'm gonna need to talk
to your brother for a bit, okay?

09:59.682 --> 10:00.960
- What's up?

10:00.961 --> 10:02.599
Hey, watch it, butthead!

10:02.600 --> 10:04.359
- Hey, watch your mouth.
Take your bag.

10:04.360 --> 10:05.559
I love you.
I'll see you later.

10:05.560 --> 10:06.679
And don't wait in the street.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.039
Wait in the same place,
all right?

10:08.040 --> 10:09.639
What's up?
- So how's it goin?

10:09.640 --> 10:11.161
- I'm fine, fine.
How you doing?

10:11.162 --> 10:12.520
- Good.

10:12.521 --> 10:13.639
Did you get my letter?

10:13.640 --> 10:14.919
- Your letter?
Uh...

10:14.920 --> 10:16.679
No, I think we missed that one.
What's wrong?

10:16.680 --> 10:18.719
- Nicole is having some issues.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.119
- Issues?
We all have issues.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.361
What's the problem?

10:21.362 --> 10:22.920
- Julio.
- Oh.

10:22.921 --> 10:24.760
- Okay?
Wow.

10:24.761 --> 10:25.839
Eli, this isn't a joke.

10:25.840 --> 10:26.841
- I know.
No, I know.

10:26.842 --> 10:27.880
It's annoying.

10:27.881 --> 10:29.199
- No, it's more than annoying.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.399
It's filthy,
and she won't take it off.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.879
Two weeks ago,
Julio told Billy Johnson to...

10:33.880 --> 10:35.079
fuck off.

10:35.080 --> 10:36.199
- No, I know.
It's bad.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.679
When she doesn't have
that thing on,

10:37.680 --> 10:39.879
she's, like, an amazing kid,
I get it.

10:39.880 --> 10:40.881
- Wow!
- What?

10:40.882 --> 10:42.720
- You been drinking?

10:42.721 --> 10:43.840
- What?
No.

10:43.841 --> 10:45.480
- You smell like booze.

10:45.481 --> 10:47.719
- No, I haven't...
I haven't been drinking.

10:47.720 --> 10:49.399
It's 9:00 in the morning.
Jesus Christ.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.279
Look, I will...
I'll talk to Nicole.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.399
We'll work it out.
Thanks for your concern, though.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.241
- What time you gonna
come pick her up?

10:55.242 --> 10:57.000
- Uh, 1:00?
Maybe 1:30?

10:57.001 --> 10:58.561
- Will you call
if you're gonna be late?

10:58.562 --> 11:00.400
- Yeah, maybe.

11:00.401 --> 11:01.760
- Mess.

11:01.761 --> 11:03.279
- Let's go.
What are you doing?

11:03.280 --> 11:05.759
- All right, I'm just rolling
a cigarette for crying out loud.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.199
- No, we can roll it
when we get there.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.359
Come on, Mom.
Let's go.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.839
- I want to smoke it
while I'm driving.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.919
- You can smoke there!
You're an adult, Jesus Christ.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.439
Mom, it's gonna be great.
Don't worry.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.639
They let you smoke in rehab.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.359
You can drink all
the decaf coffee you want.

11:16.360 --> 11:17.639
- Decaf? Ugh.
I hate decaf.

11:17.640 --> 11:18.799
- People clean up after you.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.999
It's basically like
living with me.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.319
- I heard the food sucks.

11:22.320 --> 11:23.561
- No, this place
is really nice.

11:23.562 --> 11:24.600
Look at that.

11:24.601 --> 11:25.919
They got a lot of trees
and grass,

11:25.920 --> 11:27.919
and trees create oxygen,
and that's good for you.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.639
You should be
breathing oxygen for a while.

11:29.640 --> 11:30.959
It would be
a nice change for you.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.439
- I'm not gonna be out here,
sweetie.

11:32.440 --> 11:33.439
I'm gonna be in there.

11:33.440 --> 11:34.759
- Look, there's a deck up there.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.319
You can make
some nice little friends.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.921
I think this place
is really nice.

11:37.922 --> 11:40.440
- Ah, "nice."
A really nice prison.

11:42.401 --> 11:43.801
- Here, take this.

11:47.641 --> 11:50.080
- Eli?
- Yeah.

11:50.081 --> 11:52.200
- I don't think I can do this.

11:52.201 --> 11:53.279
- Yeah, but...
- No, sweetie.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.959
I don't know if I'm ready.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.279
- Yeah, right.
You're going.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.879
I don't care if I have
to drag you in there.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.599
You're going, come on.
- What are you doing?

11:59.600 --> 12:00.799
- I'm dragging you inside.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.479
- Eli, stop it!
This isn't funny!

12:02.480 --> 12:04.001
- Nope, not joking.
Come on.

12:04.002 --> 12:05.680
- Let go!
- Okay.

12:05.681 --> 12:07.719
- What the hell
is wrong with you?

12:07.720 --> 12:09.441
- I told you, if you won't go
on your own,

12:09.442 --> 12:11.160
I will drag you inside.

12:12.841 --> 12:14.641
I was about to drag you inside.

12:14.642 --> 12:15.760
- You're crazy.

12:15.761 --> 12:18.119
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I'm crazy.

12:18.120 --> 12:20.159
I'm crazy,
not the 45-year-old drug addict

12:20.160 --> 12:22.041
who refuses
to get her shit together.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.281
No, me, I'm crazy.

12:26.161 --> 12:28.241
- My problem is not
as big as you think.

12:28.242 --> 12:29.440
- Oh, no?

12:29.441 --> 12:31.839
You were missing
for 24 hours straight, okay?

12:31.840 --> 12:33.279
We went looking for you all day.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.519
Your daughter thought you
had killed yourself, okay?

12:35.520 --> 12:37.759
She's nine years old,
and she was hysterical.

12:37.760 --> 12:39.319
- I know.
- Okay, you remember that?

12:39.320 --> 12:41.561
- Yes, I do remember.
Thank you for reminding me.

12:41.562 --> 12:43.001
- No problem.

12:46.961 --> 12:48.680
Mom.

12:48.681 --> 12:52.680
Please don't fight me on this,
okay?

12:52.681 --> 12:56.680
If not for me... or you...

12:56.681 --> 12:58.041
do it for Nicole.

13:06.721 --> 13:08.040
Okay, good.

13:08.041 --> 13:09.919
You need some help
with your bags or something?

13:09.920 --> 13:11.081
- No, I've got it.

13:11.082 --> 13:13.200
- All right, come on.
Good.

13:13.201 --> 13:14.359
Give me your hand.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.759
Okay, all right, good.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.201
See?
It's not that hard.

13:17.202 --> 13:19.480
Left, right.
Left, right.

13:19.481 --> 13:21.521
Very good, you're doing so well.

13:22.641 --> 13:24.000
- Come on.

13:24.001 --> 13:26.880
Okay, come on.

13:26.881 --> 13:29.041
There's some nice people
for you to be friends with.

13:29.042 --> 13:32.360
Hi, this is my mom, Penny.

13:32.361 --> 13:33.640
Okay.

13:33.641 --> 13:35.201
They didn't seem interested.

13:35.202 --> 13:37.961
- You never heard
of ana-nom-anymity?

13:39.641 --> 13:41.280
- In you go.

13:41.281 --> 13:44.840
In you go.

13:44.841 --> 13:45.960
Hi.

13:45.961 --> 13:49.160
Come on.

13:49.161 --> 13:52.080
So we are, uh...
okay, all right.

13:53.320 --> 13:54.401
- Can I help you?

13:54.402 --> 13:56.040
- Checking in.

13:59.961 --> 14:03.320
- Fill this out.
Fill that up.

14:03.321 --> 14:04.919
You should be really proud
of your son.

14:04.920 --> 14:06.761
It takes a lot of courage
to walk in that door.

14:06.762 --> 14:09.120
- Mighty proud.

14:09.121 --> 14:12.320
Wait outside for me, baby?

14:12.321 --> 14:14.840
- Okay.

14:14.841 --> 14:15.999
- No, I mean it, Eli.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.199
Wait outside for me.

14:17.200 --> 14:18.401
I'll come say good-bye, okay?

14:18.402 --> 14:19.721
- Yeah.

14:41.641 --> 14:43.121
Hey.

14:46.521 --> 14:47.721
Hi.

14:50.961 --> 14:52.801
No, no.
I don't smoke.

14:55.281 --> 14:56.961
- Congratulations.

15:07.881 --> 15:09.041
Stay.

15:26.201 --> 15:29.001
- It's not like I use drugs
every single day.

15:29.002 --> 15:31.880
I just, you know, um...

15:31.881 --> 15:34.560
sometimes when I get started

15:34.561 --> 15:38.800
that I kind of find it
hard to... stop.

15:38.801 --> 15:41.641
- And you've tried to stop
using drugs and alcohol before?

15:41.642 --> 15:44.320
- Well, yeah, kinda sorta.

15:44.321 --> 15:45.600
- "Kinda sorta"?

15:58.921 --> 16:00.441
- We got a problem here.

16:00.442 --> 16:01.880
- What's the problem?

16:01.881 --> 16:03.919
- First, you don't have
dirty urine.

16:03.920 --> 16:06.559
- Well, yeah, I mean,
I was kinda getting ready

16:06.560 --> 16:07.801
to come into rehab.

16:07.802 --> 16:10.200
I haven't used in several days.

16:10.201 --> 16:12.400
- Second...
- Yeah, well, what?

16:12.401 --> 16:13.641
- You don't have insurance.

16:15.401 --> 16:16.920
- On.

16:16.921 --> 16:18.879
- Penny, listen,
you can't repeat

16:18.880 --> 16:20.161
what I'm gonna say
to you.

16:20.162 --> 16:21.760
- Okay.

16:21.761 --> 16:25.160
- Go out, cop, get high,

16:25.161 --> 16:26.921
and bring me back
some dirty urine,

16:26.922 --> 16:30.240
and I will fight
to get you that bed.

16:30.241 --> 16:32.361
- You're telling me
to go get high

16:32.362 --> 16:35.520
so I can get into rehab?

16:35.521 --> 16:37.761
- That's the beautiful system
we got, right?

16:37.762 --> 16:39.440
- Ridiculous.

16:49.281 --> 16:52.080
Yo, w... what are you doing?

16:52.081 --> 16:54.520
- I don't qualify
for detox rehab.

16:54.521 --> 16:55.921
You have to be high
to get in here.

16:55.922 --> 16:57.560
You believe that crap?

16:57.561 --> 16:59.519
- Wait, how do you not?
You abuse drugs, don't you?

16:59.520 --> 17:00.839
Doesn't that qualify you?

17:00.840 --> 17:02.201
- You have to have insurance.

17:02.202 --> 17:05.280
I wait tables.
They don't give us insurance.

17:05.281 --> 17:06.759
- I can't believe this.
- I don't know.

17:06.760 --> 17:07.959
I feel like, you know,

17:07.960 --> 17:09.439
the government
should help people.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.279
They want to get help,
they should help 'em.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.118
- Oh, it's the government's
fault, of course.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.961
It's the government's fault.
Who else?

17:14.962 --> 17:16.160
Fuck.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.800
Fuck! Fuck!

17:17.801 --> 17:20.680
Fuck
Now you are fucking up my day.

17:20.681 --> 17:22.719
- What... sweetie,
what do you want me to do?

17:22.720 --> 17:24.118
- I want you
to get your act together

17:24.119 --> 17:25.638
and get clean
so I can leave, okay?

17:25.640 --> 17:26.959
I am sick of taking care of you!

17:26.960 --> 17:28.241
I can't do this shit forever!

17:28.242 --> 17:31.041
I want...
I want fucking normal things!

17:33.481 --> 17:37.560
- Eli, how am I
fucking up your day?

17:37.561 --> 17:39.800
Huh?

17:39.801 --> 17:40.921
Eli.

17:43.161 --> 17:44.760
Eli?

17:44.761 --> 17:46.321
- I have an audition today,
okay?

17:46.322 --> 17:47.800
- Huh?
What?

17:47.801 --> 17:49.401
- It's for
a music conservatory.

17:52.401 --> 17:53.641
- They have one spot open.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.480
- Listen, listen!
Shh!

17:56.481 --> 17:58.080
It is in Boston.

17:58.081 --> 18:00.960
- Oh!
Boston?

18:00.961 --> 18:03.399
- Yeah.
- And why didn't you tell me?

18:03.400 --> 18:04.801
- It's four hours away.

18:04.802 --> 18:07.080
You have to take care of Nicole,

18:07.081 --> 18:10.120
because if I get accepted,

18:10.121 --> 18:11.599
I leave in five weeks.

18:11.600 --> 18:12.921
I'll be gone for a year.

18:12.922 --> 18:14.400
- A year?

18:14.401 --> 18:16.919
- Dave had to pull some strings
just to get me the audition.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.361
So you have to get clean.

18:18.362 --> 18:20.520
- Sweetie.

18:20.521 --> 18:22.400
It's a good school?

18:22.401 --> 18:24.520
- Yeah.

18:24.521 --> 18:25.680
Yeah, it's a...

18:25.681 --> 18:27.361
it's a really serious school.

18:33.361 --> 18:36.280
Fuck... so...

18:36.281 --> 18:37.881
all right, so now what do we do?

18:39.361 --> 18:41.199
- You know, Eli,
the guy in there, he tells me...

18:41.200 --> 18:42.881
and I know
this is gonna sound crazy...

18:42.882 --> 18:44.200
- Yeah?

18:44.201 --> 18:48.000
- But if I get high
and can produce dirty urine,

18:48.001 --> 18:49.720
then I'm in.

18:49.721 --> 18:52.240
That's crazy, right?

18:52.241 --> 18:56.200
- Yeah, yeah,
it is pretty crazy.

18:56.201 --> 18:58.600
All right.

18:58.601 --> 19:00.400
So let's do it then.

19:00.401 --> 19:01.720
Come on.

19:01.721 --> 19:03.281
Let's get you some crack
or something.

19:03.282 --> 19:04.560
Come on.

19:04.561 --> 19:06.201
- Eli, I can't have you
be a part of this.

19:06.202 --> 19:07.440
Mm-mm, no.

19:07.441 --> 19:11.640
- Mom, I'm already
a part of this.

19:11.641 --> 19:13.919
I've been a part of this
my whole life.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.039
Okay, so come on, you know what?

19:16.040 --> 19:17.841
I will pay for it.
It'll be my treat, come on.

19:17.842 --> 19:19.920
- Come on.

19:19.921 --> 19:21.841
- And I don't do crack,
all right?

19:21.842 --> 19:23.920
You'd be a fool to do crack.

19:23.921 --> 19:24.959
What do you think I am,

19:24.960 --> 19:26.399
some kind of dirt bag
or something?

19:26.400 --> 19:27.761
- Yeah, I do.
Yeah, get in the car.

19:27.762 --> 19:28.760
- It's my car.

19:28.761 --> 19:29.839
- I know.
I'm driving it.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.199
Get in the car.
Mom, hurry up.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.639
The audition's
in two hours, okay?

19:32.640 --> 19:34.479
- People shouldn't
have to go through all this

19:34.480 --> 19:35.519
when they want some help.

19:35.520 --> 19:36.841
It's ridiculous.
Ridiculous.

19:42.441 --> 19:43.961
- This is where
you buy your drugs?

19:43.962 --> 19:45.760
It's suburbia.

19:45.761 --> 19:48.120
- Eli, you don't buy,
you cop.

19:48.121 --> 19:49.199
All right, park here.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.479
- I'm sure they're really happy

19:50.480 --> 19:53.081
you're bringing business
into the area.

19:53.082 --> 19:55.680
All right, make this quick.

19:55.681 --> 19:57.599
- I can't go in there.
- Huh?

19:57.600 --> 19:59.121
- You've gotta get it for me.

19:59.122 --> 20:00.520
You said you would.

20:00.521 --> 20:01.919
- What, are you crazy?

20:01.920 --> 20:03.159
- Eli, you said you would.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.281
I cannot go in there.

20:04.282 --> 20:05.680
I owe the guy money.

20:05.681 --> 20:07.800
- Fuck.
Fuck.

20:07.801 --> 20:08.959
You're killing me, Mom.

20:08.960 --> 20:10.121
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

20:10.122 --> 20:11.280
- What?

20:11.281 --> 20:13.679
- You look ridiculous.
Lose the tie.

20:13.680 --> 20:14.799
- What's wrong with the tie?

20:14.800 --> 20:15.839
- Take it off, Eli.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.279
Just take the stupid tie off.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.319
- All right.
- Now put this on.

20:19.320 --> 20:20.799
There you go.
There you go.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.681
Put it on; we've got to
rough you up a little bit.

20:22.682 --> 20:24.040
- What is this?

20:24.041 --> 20:26.039
- It's something I got you
for Christmas years ago.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.599
You never wore it.
- You got this for me?

20:27.600 --> 20:28.839
- Can't wait to see it on you.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.479
- You got this
in the women's department?

20:30.480 --> 20:31.679
- You look adorable.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.479
- You think
I'm an adolescent teenaged girl?

20:33.480 --> 20:34.759
- Sweetie, it's unisex.
Come on.

20:34.760 --> 20:35.919
- This looks all right?

20:35.920 --> 20:37.599
- I wish you had
a little more scruff on you.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.639
- Yeah, well, I shaved,
you know, for the audition.

20:39.640 --> 20:41.999
- Oh, yeah, that, well...
you look great then.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.881
But you can
change back later.

20:43.882 --> 20:46.320
All right, here.
Put these on.

20:46.321 --> 20:47.479
There you go.
All right.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.521
Oh, we'll do this.

20:48.522 --> 20:49.640
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:49.641 --> 20:50.839
- It's all right?
- There we go.

20:50.840 --> 20:51.879
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

20:51.880 --> 20:52.999
- I think so.
- No, it's not.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.079
I look like the Unabomber.

20:54.080 --> 20:55.199
- Oh, my God, you're right.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.641
Forget that.
Okay, here.

20:56.642 --> 20:57.680
Sweet.

20:57.681 --> 20:58.719
- Good?
- Good, yeah.

20:58.720 --> 20:59.959
- Okay, so what do I do?

20:59.960 --> 21:01.159
- Okay.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.519
You knock on the door.
- Okay.

21:02.520 --> 21:03.999
- And you ask
for Sprinkles, right?

21:04.000 --> 21:05.281
- Ask for Sprinkles?
- Mm-hmm.

21:05.282 --> 21:07.280
- That's a person?
- Yeah.

21:07.281 --> 21:08.679
If he asks who you are,

21:08.680 --> 21:10.881
you tell him you're a friend
of Pauly Rezzer's.

21:10.882 --> 21:13.360
He'll know who that is.
- Okay.

21:13.361 --> 21:17.360
- When you get inside,
you ask for a 20 of blow.

21:17.361 --> 21:18.600
Uh, no.

21:18.601 --> 21:21.800
You'd better...
better make that 50, right?

21:21.801 --> 21:22.879
- Sure, why not a kilo?

21:22.880 --> 21:24.279
- Just listen, all right?

21:24.280 --> 21:25.399
- All right, sorry.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.719
- Then you give him the money.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.519
He'll go in the back,
get the shit,

21:28.520 --> 21:30.241
and then you get out of there,
all right?

21:30.242 --> 21:32.800
And do not tell him who you are.

21:32.801 --> 21:34.840
- Why?
Who am I?

21:34.841 --> 21:36.361
- My son.

21:38.881 --> 21:41.560
Go make your mother proud.

21:41.561 --> 21:43.401
- This is ridiculous.

21:57.081 --> 21:59.121
- Ah, ya fuckin' door!

22:06.400 --> 22:07.879
- Don't speak <i>español.</i>

22:07.880 --> 22:09.079
- Don't hold out on me, Black.

22:09.080 --> 22:10.761
You know
I don't speak Spanish.

22:10.762 --> 22:12.000
Help me help you.

22:12.001 --> 22:13.359
I can't do everything.

22:14.442 --> 22:15.600
Hold on!

22:15.601 --> 22:17.401
Acting like you the damn police.

22:17.402 --> 22:18.560
What up?

22:18.561 --> 22:19.919
- Hey, not much.
How's it going?

22:19.920 --> 22:21.521
- I'm good.
Can I help you?

22:21.522 --> 22:22.960
- Good, good.

22:22.961 --> 22:25.799
So, uh, okay, so I'm a friend
of Pauly Rezzer's.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.799
He's a good friend of mine.
He told me to stop by.

22:27.800 --> 22:28.921
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

22:28.922 --> 22:31.280
- What's his middle name?

22:31.281 --> 22:33.200
- I, uh...

22:33.201 --> 22:34.239
I think it's, uh...

22:34.240 --> 22:35.839
- Nah, I'm just fuckin' with ya.

22:35.840 --> 22:37.881
Come on in.
Gotta stay on my toes.

22:37.882 --> 22:39.320
Wipe your feet off.

22:39.321 --> 22:41.480
My mother just cleaned.
Mommy!

22:41.481 --> 22:43.760
- No, no, no, no.

22:43.761 --> 22:44.960
No, no.

22:44.961 --> 22:47.760
No, see, no, dude, English!

22:47.761 --> 22:50.361
No, man, I need you
to speak English, okay?

22:50.362 --> 22:52.880
- How do you know Pauly?

22:52.881 --> 22:53.959
- Yeah, we play...

22:53.960 --> 22:55.799
we play music together,
so... yeah.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.199
- I didn't know Pauly
played music.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.479
- Yeah, big time, big time.

22:58.480 --> 23:00.279
We, uh, tickle the ivories
sometimes, I guess.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.521
- Anybody there
speak English?

23:01.522 --> 23:03.760
- I love sports.

23:03.761 --> 23:06.640
- What kind of sport's that,
eating?

23:06.641 --> 23:08.921
- Ma, why you giving me
a hard time?

23:08.922 --> 23:10.960
I'm talking to the white boy.

23:10.961 --> 23:12.599
So you like Mozarts and shit?

23:12.600 --> 23:14.319
- Yeah.
Yeah, you like that shit?

23:14.320 --> 23:15.959
You like that fucking shit?
Me too.

23:15.960 --> 23:17.481
- Nah, I'm not partial
to Mozart,

23:17.482 --> 23:18.720
but I love music.

23:18.721 --> 23:20.119
<i>- No comprende, maricon.</i>

23:20.120 --> 23:21.919

<i>- No comprende.</i>

23:21.920 --> 23:24.279

23:29.760 --> 23:31.319
- Sorry, Mommy.
- I don't know.

23:31.320 --> 23:33.319
We need to get Javier in here
to translate, man.

23:33.320 --> 23:34.839
I don't understand this.

23:34.840 --> 23:36.801
- I'm quite sure
<i>restauranto</i> means restaurant.

23:36.802 --> 23:38.200
- Yo, so can I, uh,

23:38.201 --> 23:39.721

23:39.722 --> 23:40.760
Yo.

I'm sorry.

23:45.520 --> 23:46.959
Yes, hi.
It smells very nice.

23:46.960 --> 23:48.759
I'm just... I'm kind of
in a rush here, you guys.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.159
Can I just get

23:50.160 --> 23:51.599
- Hold on.
What he talking about?

23:51.600 --> 23:52.761
- I don't know, man.

23:52.762 --> 23:55.680
He got this, uh, uh, <i>negociar,</i>

23:55.681 --> 23:57.200
<i>negro...</i>

23:57.201 --> 23:58.919
- Negotiate.
He means negotiate, okay?

23:58.920 --> 24:00.601
- Yo!

24:05.601 --> 24:07.201
<i>Ah, gracias.</i>
There you go.

24:07.202 --> 24:08.560
- What was that?

24:08.561 --> 24:10.761
- He said to meet him
at the restaurant in 20 minutes

24:10.762 --> 24:13.040
to negotiate,
to make the deal.

24:13.041 --> 24:14.480
- You speak Spanish?

24:14.481 --> 24:16.640
<i>- Sí.</i>
Yes.

24:16.641 --> 24:18.039
- That's cool.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.761
Thanks a lot, bop.
- All right, man.

24:19.762 --> 24:21.880
- Thanks.

24:21.881 --> 24:24.161
So, uh, all right,
can I get a 50 of blow?

24:24.162 --> 24:26.680
- All out.
- You're all out?

24:26.681 --> 24:28.199
- You heard the man.
He said we all out.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.599
- What are you,
a vending machine?

24:29.600 --> 24:31.719
You're a drug dealer.
How do you run out of drugs?

24:31.720 --> 24:32.841
You have nothing here?

24:32.842 --> 24:34.720
- No, that was my connect.

24:34.721 --> 24:36.039
It's re-up time, homes.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.561
- That was your guy?
- Yeah.

24:37.562 --> 24:39.880
- Fuck!
Okay, well...

24:39.881 --> 24:42.560
All right.

24:42.561 --> 24:44.160
I'll go with you, okay?

24:44.161 --> 24:46.400
And, uh, I'll translate for you.

24:46.401 --> 24:47.919
How does that sound?
How about that?

24:47.920 --> 24:49.199
- Hell, yeah.
That's cool.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.079
- Good, we can even take my car.
What do you think?

24:51.080 --> 24:52.639
- I might even throw in
a free eight ball.

24:52.640 --> 24:54.519
- Whatever.
I can buy you dinner...

24:54.520 --> 24:56.801
- You're leaving after I cooked
all this food for you?

24:56.802 --> 24:58.280
- Ma, not now!

24:58.281 --> 24:59.920
You're driving me crazy!

24:59.921 --> 25:02.400
I told you today

25:02.401 --> 25:05.121
Them collard greens
didn't buy themselves!

25:05.122 --> 25:06.360
- Waste.

25:06.361 --> 25:07.841
- Come on, Black.
- That's all it is.

25:07.842 --> 25:09.680
- Save me a plate, Moms.

25:09.681 --> 25:11.121
- What you said
your name was again?

25:11.122 --> 25:12.280
- Uh, Mozart.

25:12.281 --> 25:13.641
- Mozart.
Like the piano man.

25:13.642 --> 25:15.680
You a funny man.

25:15.681 --> 25:16.999
Ain't he funny, Black?

25:17.000 --> 25:18.041
- Yeah, he funny.

25:19.121 --> 25:21.121
Let's do it.

25:26.521 --> 25:27.640

25:27.641 --> 25:28.959
What the fuck

25:28.960 --> 25:30.519
- Hey, man,
I know I owe you money.

25:30.520 --> 25:32.319
I shouldn't have come.

25:32.320 --> 25:33.921

25:33.922 --> 25:35.640

25:35.641 --> 25:38.199
Let me wrap my brain

25:38.200 --> 25:40.119
Black, does this bitch

25:40.120 --> 25:42.159
- Yeah, the bitch

25:42.160 --> 25:43.959

25:43.960 --> 25:45.559
Or your boy.

25:45.560 --> 25:47.279
No, I'm going

25:47.280 --> 25:48.799
- Translate what?
- Yo, Mom, shut up.

25:48.800 --> 25:50.079
Yo, does that cancel her debt?

25:50.080 --> 25:52.079
- We are not doing anything.
Fuck that!

25:52.080 --> 25:53.841
- Yes, we are.
- Oh, yes, you are.

25:53.842 --> 25:55.640
Your boy works for me now.

25:55.641 --> 25:56.799
- Yeah, and what if I say no?

25:56.800 --> 25:58.319
- Black beats the shit

25:58.320 --> 26:00.481
and I'll pull all your
fucking teeth out of your head,

26:00.482 --> 26:02.960
then make you gargle vinegar.

26:04.521 --> 26:06.160
- Good?
- Yeah.

26:06.161 --> 26:07.320
- Great.

26:07.321 --> 26:08.841
Let's get in the fucking car.

26:08.842 --> 26:10.040
- Come on, man.

26:10.041 --> 26:11.719

26:11.720 --> 26:14.201
Hey, hey, hey, listen to him.
Get in the car, okay?

26:14.202 --> 26:15.800
I'm driving.
Come on.

26:15.801 --> 26:16.880
- Come on.

26:16.881 --> 26:18.201
- Put that boy's life
in danger?

26:18.202 --> 26:21.160
You fucking idiot!

26:21.161 --> 26:22.360
- Hey, hey, hey.

26:25.361 --> 26:28.200
- Look at all this garbage
in here.

26:28.201 --> 26:29.961
How long this Pamper
been sitting here?

26:31.441 --> 26:32.519
Come on, move the car!

26:33.522 --> 26:35.160
- Got to pump the gas.

26:35.161 --> 26:36.959
- Mom, stop it.
What are you doing?

26:36.960 --> 26:38.599
- All right, okay, all right.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.401
- Yo, let's start
this bitch up.

26:40.402 --> 26:41.520
- We're trying.

26:41.521 --> 26:42.839
- Trying to do what?
Turn the key.

26:42.840 --> 26:44.479
- Move the car.
Come on!

26:44.480 --> 26:45.719
- This raggedy shit.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.679
- Stop all the shucking
and jiving up there.

26:47.680 --> 26:49.479
- Jesus Christ,
you're embarrassing me.

26:49.480 --> 26:50.759
- Mozart, let's go.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.399
Come on, man, y'all slow,
and y'all dumb.

26:52.400 --> 26:54.359
- Turn the key and let's go
get the hell out of here.

26:54.360 --> 26:55.399
- Slow and dumb.

26:55.400 --> 26:56.639
- Yeah, slow and dumb.
Let's go.

26:56.640 --> 26:57.999
- Is that possible?
- I don't know.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.001
- Move the car, Mozart!

27:00.161 --> 27:01.719
- I got it!
- Thank God you got it going.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.119
- You got lucky.
- Let's go.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.201
- Oh, man, it's a traveling dump
you got here, man.

27:05.202 --> 27:06.240
- Disgusting.

27:06.241 --> 27:07.719
- What kind of damn car is this,
Penny?

27:07.720 --> 27:09.281
- Look at this.
Look at this right here.

27:09.282 --> 27:10.720
What's that?

27:10.721 --> 27:12.719
Mozart, you better know
that Spanish.

27:12.720 --> 27:14.119
- Oh, he knows Spanish.

27:14.120 --> 27:15.999
- I'ma whoop your ass,
and you can believe that.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.159
He look half Puerto Rican.

27:17.160 --> 27:18.839
- Puerto Rican?
He's Jewish.

27:18.840 --> 27:20.959
- Got good hair.
- He does have good hair.

27:20.960 --> 27:22.839
- Let me hear you say something.

27:22.840 --> 27:25.239
- You know, you don't have to
prove to them you speak Spanish.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.239
- Yeah, I do know Spanish.

27:26.240 --> 27:27.399
- Eli, there's no...

27:27.400 --> 27:28.879
you don't gotta show off,
all right?

27:28.880 --> 27:30.119
- You better know that Spanish,

27:30.120 --> 27:31.441
or I'ma whoop your ass
in Spanish.

27:31.442 --> 27:32.800
- No, I do know.

27:32.801 --> 27:34.719
- You ain't never had your ass
whooped in Spanish.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.559
- Guys, stop; I know
how to speak Spanish, okay?

27:36.560 --> 27:37.919
- Stay in the car, Penny.
- No way.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.559
You're taking him in there,
I'm going too.

27:39.560 --> 27:40.799
- This better not
take too long.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.399
- Listen, Penny...
- I go where my son goes!

27:42.400 --> 27:44.319
End of discussion!
- Don't bother with her, okay?

27:44.320 --> 27:46.639
- Don't worry about it, Sprink.
Bop, I'll keep an eye on her.

27:46.640 --> 27:47.639
- Mozart.
- Yeah.

27:47.640 --> 27:48.639
- Come here.
- What?

27:48.640 --> 27:49.921
- This is not a game.
- I know.

27:49.922 --> 27:51.400
- Focus.

27:51.401 --> 27:52.640
You hear me?

27:52.641 --> 27:54.440
- Yeah.

27:54.441 --> 27:56.561
Isn't there some, like,
back entrance we can go

27:56.562 --> 27:58.481
to buy your drugs in here?

28:07.401 --> 28:11.040
<i>- Hola,</i> Mama.

28:12.282 --> 28:13.800
- He said to sit down.

28:17.041 --> 28:19.961
Okay.

28:38.361 --> 28:39.680
- What's happening?

28:39.681 --> 28:41.519
- Sorry, we're just doing
some introductions,

28:41.520 --> 28:43.161
and also,
he's insulting me.

29:02.561 --> 29:04.201
- What are you laughing about?
- Nothing.

29:06.441 --> 29:07.721
- What's going on, man?
Come on.

29:07.722 --> 29:09.160
- All right.

29:09.161 --> 29:10.720
Okay, <i>gracias.</i>

29:10.721 --> 29:13.999
Okay, sorry, um, all right,
so what did you want to buy?

29:14.000 --> 29:17.321
- Tell him to give me
two ounces of that Snow White,

29:17.322 --> 29:21.320
two ounces of Beetlejuice,
and a forest full of trees.

29:21.321 --> 29:24.040
Tell him that.
- Beetlejuice?

29:24.041 --> 29:25.479
- Just tell him.
- All right.

29:25.480 --> 29:27.361
Oh, shit.

29:32.281 --> 29:33.399
- Sorry.
He said I could.

29:33.400 --> 29:34.561
Okay, hello?
- Hey.

29:34.562 --> 29:36.400
- Hi, Chloe.
Yeah, hi.

29:36.401 --> 29:38.360
Sorry, um...
- Mozart.

29:38.361 --> 29:40.519
- Okay, yeah.
Sorry, I can't actually...

29:40.520 --> 29:41.519
- Come on, man, let's go.

29:41.520 --> 29:42.879
Pass on that.
- Okay.

29:42.880 --> 29:44.679
- Let's tighten it up, man.

29:44.680 --> 29:45.919
Mozart, get off the phone.

29:45.920 --> 29:46.999
Okay, I gotta go.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.239
- Thank you.
Get off the phone.

29:48.240 --> 29:49.361
- Bye-bye.
Okay.

29:54.561 --> 29:55.719
- Mozart!
Mozart!

29:55.720 --> 29:57.199
- Sorry, sorry, okay.
- What's up?

29:57.200 --> 29:58.921
- All right, not much.
Okay, let's do this.

29:58.922 --> 30:00.760
What are we buying?

30:00.761 --> 30:02.399
- Tell him to give me
two ounces of coke,

30:02.400 --> 30:04.601
two ounces of heroin,
and a pound of weed.

30:04.602 --> 30:05.760
Tell him.

30:05.761 --> 30:08.321
- Just keep it down, okay?

30:26.881 --> 30:28.801
- All right.
- Okay.

30:44.881 --> 30:48.600
- Wow.
It's, uh, $7,000.

30:48.601 --> 30:50.641
- Seven fucking
thousand dollars?

30:50.642 --> 30:52.640
Are you fucking crazy?

30:52.641 --> 30:54.559
You won't get a dime
past $5,000,

30:54.560 --> 30:56.279
you Clark-Kent-looking
motherfucker.

30:56.280 --> 30:57.441
- Hey, calm down.
Calm down.

30:57.442 --> 30:58.600
It's fine.

30:58.601 --> 30:59.720
Um, I got it.

30:59.721 --> 31:00.799
- You got to calm him down,

31:00.800 --> 31:02.199
seven thousand fucking dollars.

31:02.200 --> 31:03.319
- I'll take care of it.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.681
- What are you on,
dope or dog food?

31:04.682 --> 31:05.800
- All right.

31:05.801 --> 31:07.279
- Fucking
seven thousand dollars.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.961
- All right, so... I got it.
I got it, okay.

31:09.962 --> 31:10.961
No, sorry.

31:20.641 --> 31:23.160
- Okay,<i> gracias.</i>
That's good.

31:23.161 --> 31:25.721
Um, now he's saying
that he can do 6,000.

31:25.722 --> 31:27.560
<i>- Uno, dos, tres,</i>

31:27.561 --> 31:28.800
<i>cuatro, cinco.</i>

31:28.801 --> 31:30.641
<i>Cinco, that's it.</i>

31:39.761 --> 31:43.520
- No, no, no, no.
I'm not saying that, no, no.

31:43.521 --> 31:45.480
No, okay.

31:45.481 --> 31:49.440
He says that if
you don't like it... I got it...

31:49.441 --> 31:50.639
he says if you don't like it,

31:50.640 --> 31:52.881
you can take your black ass
somewhere else.

31:52.882 --> 31:54.000
- Black ass?

31:54.001 --> 31:55.599
I'm African-American,
motherfucker!

31:55.600 --> 31:56.599
- Hey, you lay off of him!

31:56.600 --> 31:57.599
- I'm fine.
Hey, stop.

31:57.600 --> 31:58.719
I am translating, okay?

31:58.720 --> 32:00.279
That means I repeat
what he says, okay?

32:00.280 --> 32:02.239
- Well, you translate this
to that man.

32:02.240 --> 32:04.159
You tell him
I'll give him $5,500

32:04.160 --> 32:07.401
if his mother and his sister
come to my house and clean it.

32:07.402 --> 32:09.440
- No way.
- Say it.

32:09.441 --> 32:10.679
- No, no, no.
Yo, no way, man.

32:10.680 --> 32:12.519
You just hit me for saying
what he told me to say.

32:12.520 --> 32:14.279
Now he's going to hit me
for saying what you...

32:14.280 --> 32:15.479
Fuck, no.
I'm not saying that.

32:15.480 --> 32:16.841
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ow, ow.

32:16.842 --> 32:18.480
- Mozart... say it.

32:18.481 --> 32:20.041
- Okay.
All right.

32:23.121 --> 32:25.321
All right, um...

32:37.201 --> 32:38.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:38.361 --> 32:40.359
- Hey, hey, hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:40.360 --> 32:41.721
- Mom, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

32:41.722 --> 32:43.721
Okay.
All right.

33:04.721 --> 33:07.561
- You happy?
Okay.

33:15.761 --> 33:16.881
<i>- Gracias.</i>
- Oh!

33:19.761 --> 33:21.280
- Shit.
No, I'm fine.

33:21.281 --> 33:22.881
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

33:32.761 --> 33:33.799
- We're fine.
We're fine.

33:33.800 --> 33:34.799
Come on.
<i>Adios.</i>

33:34.800 --> 33:35.919
- Eli, Eli,
what happened?

33:35.920 --> 33:36.961
- Come on, it's fine.

33:36.962 --> 33:38.800
- Oh, God, you're bleeding.

33:38.801 --> 33:40.359
- Let's get out of here.
Let's just go.

33:40.360 --> 33:42.679
- Eli, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

33:42.680 --> 33:44.599
- What did he say?
- He said he'll call me later.

33:44.600 --> 33:46.119
- Let me see your hand.
Oh, my God.

33:46.120 --> 33:47.759
- Call you?
- Yeah, he doesn't like you.

33:47.760 --> 33:48.959
He only wants to talk to me.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.679
- What about the money?
- I told you already.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.521
Stop asking me about
the fucking money, okay?

33:52.522 --> 33:53.800
It's 5,500.

33:53.801 --> 33:56.600
- I said <i>cinco</i>,
not <i>cinco cinco</i> hundred.

33:56.601 --> 33:59.401
- Five five hundred?
That doesn't make any sense.

33:59.402 --> 34:03.000
- Mozart, blood is dripping
on your shoe, boss.

34:03.001 --> 34:04.559
- Sweetie, let me see it.

34:04.560 --> 34:05.599
- Ow.
- Oh, my God.

34:05.600 --> 34:07.079
That's a lot of blood.

34:07.080 --> 34:08.321
Okay, ooh, there's glass in it.

34:08.322 --> 34:09.639
- It really hurts.

34:09.641 --> 34:11.478
- All right, okay,
now, just wrap it up tight.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.119
- Wait, Mom,
how am I going to play later?

34:13.120 --> 34:15.119
- It's all right, sweetie.
You're going to be okay.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.599
- No, how am I going to
play later?

34:16.600 --> 34:18.639
- We'll wrap this up tight.
We'll stop the bleeding.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.079
You hold on to it, okay?
There you go.

34:20.080 --> 34:21.201
- This is a bunch of bullshit!

34:21.202 --> 34:23.159
Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

34:23.161 --> 34:24.399
- Jesus.
Eli, get in the car.

34:24.400 --> 34:25.521
Just get in the car.

34:25.522 --> 34:27.320
Get yourself in the car.

34:27.321 --> 34:29.321
You talked such good Spanish
with him, sweetie.

34:29.322 --> 34:33.159
I was so proud.
Okay.

34:33.161 --> 34:35.079
- Oh, shit, yo,
this really hurts.

34:35.080 --> 34:37.199
- You know, I've got some Motrin
in here somewhere.

34:37.199 --> 34:38.958
- Shit, now I'm not going
to be able to play.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.119
- Tough luck, kid.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.559
- I get the worst cramps
on my period,

34:41.560 --> 34:43.998
and nowadays, whoa,
jeez, I get hot flashes

34:44.000 --> 34:45.360
and cramps at all the same time.

34:45.362 --> 34:46.440
- Penny!

34:46.440 --> 34:47.958
Nobody wanna hear this shit.
Come on.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.918
- That's how God made women.
Can't knock it, man.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.521
- Could you look
under the seat, please?

34:51.522 --> 34:53.159
It's somewhere in here.

34:53.161 --> 34:55.359
- This'd be easier if this
wasn't a junkyard on wheels.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.438
- Oh, hey, thanks a lot.

34:56.440 --> 34:57.601
- Ugh!
What is this?

34:57.602 --> 34:59.200
- Oh, who knows?

34:59.201 --> 35:01.561
Yeah, no, I wouldn't touch
your face with that hand now.

35:01.562 --> 35:03.240
- Ah, fuck.
Ow, shit.

35:03.241 --> 35:05.119
My hand is totally busted.
I can't play with it.

35:05.120 --> 35:06.439
- Let me see.
Let me see, sweetie.

35:06.440 --> 35:07.881
Give it to me.
Give it to me.

35:07.882 --> 35:09.840
Let me see.
- Penny!

35:09.841 --> 35:11.519
- Keep your eyes on the road.
- Penny!

35:11.520 --> 35:12.881
- You're swerving off the road!

35:14.041 --> 35:15.161
- All right!
Okay!

35:15.162 --> 35:17.360
I am just trying to help you.

35:17.361 --> 35:18.680
- Penny.

35:18.681 --> 35:20.719
- Where did you learn
how to drive, kindergarten?

35:20.720 --> 35:21.999
- Penny!
Penny, watch the road!

35:22.000 --> 35:23.321
- Mom, just watch the road,
okay?

35:23.322 --> 35:24.520
I'm fine.

35:24.521 --> 35:26.239
- I just want to see
if it's still bleeding.

35:26.240 --> 35:28.399
- Sprinkles, you got to do
something about this woman.

35:28.400 --> 35:29.879
- She's gonna kill us!
- Yeah, I know!

35:29.880 --> 35:31.199
- Mom, just look at the road,
okay?

35:31.200 --> 35:32.319
- I know, Eli!
- Mom.

35:32.320 --> 35:33.841
Whoa, whoa, Mom, look out!
Look out.

35:36.401 --> 35:37.560
- Oh. my God!

35:37.561 --> 35:38.639
- Penny!
Damn it!

35:38.640 --> 35:39.879
- What's wrong with you, lady?

35:39.880 --> 35:41.319
- Okay, okay, all right.

35:41.320 --> 35:44.161
- You two are a bunch of wild
and crazy kids, the Blooms!

35:44.162 --> 35:45.280
Who knew?

35:45.281 --> 35:46.921
- Here, man.
- What did you find?

35:46.922 --> 35:49.480
What is that?
Got 'em?

35:49.481 --> 35:51.880
Red ones, right?
Sweetie?

35:51.881 --> 35:53.041
What, what are you taking?

35:53.042 --> 35:55.400
What's...

35:55.401 --> 35:57.080
Eli!

35:57.081 --> 35:58.520
That's Oxy!

35:58.521 --> 36:00.399
There was two in there.
Did you take them both?

36:00.400 --> 36:01.519
- Yeah.
I took two.

36:01.520 --> 36:02.801
Now turn around.
- Oh, sh...

36:04.001 --> 36:06.319
You about to be stratosphere,
Mozart.

36:06.320 --> 36:07.479
That's beyond high.

36:07.480 --> 36:08.759
And buckle up, kids.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.401
It's about to get wild
and wooly in here.

36:11.881 --> 36:14.839
- Sweetie, I did not know
I had this Oxy in the car.

36:14.840 --> 36:16.561
- And what is this on my hand?

36:19.721 --> 36:22.519
People don't live in squalor
like this no more, man.

36:22.520 --> 36:24.039
- Yeah, I guess they do,
though, man.

36:24.040 --> 36:26.719
- Bunch of gypsies living here
that don't wear shoes,

36:26.720 --> 36:27.799
'cause it
smell like feet.

36:27.800 --> 36:29.119
- I know some gypsies,

36:29.120 --> 36:30.799
and they ain't got a place
as nasty as this.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.479
- Somebody need
tough-actin' Tinactin.

36:32.480 --> 36:33.601
That's all I'm sayin'.

36:33.602 --> 36:35.440
- Yeah?

36:35.441 --> 36:37.400
- Okay.

36:37.401 --> 36:39.920
- All right.
There we go.

36:39.921 --> 36:41.560
- Okay.
- Okay.

36:41.561 --> 36:43.640
Good?
All righty.

36:43.641 --> 36:44.800
Are you okay?

36:44.801 --> 36:46.240
- Yeah, no.
- Huh?

36:46.241 --> 36:47.841
- I'm starting to feel weird.

36:47.842 --> 36:51.920
- Yeah, and it's gonna get
really weird pretty soon, okay?

36:51.921 --> 36:53.081
But do you know what, baby?

36:53.082 --> 36:54.600
- What?

36:54.601 --> 36:56.681
- You can still make
that audition.

36:56.682 --> 36:57.880
I know you can.

36:57.881 --> 36:59.400
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

36:59.401 --> 37:02.800
- Mom.
Mom, it's pointless now.

37:02.801 --> 37:06.040
- Honey, you play better
than most people

37:06.041 --> 37:10.800
if this hand was amputated,
for heaven's sake, all right?

37:10.801 --> 37:12.361
I know you think
I don't want you to go,

37:12.362 --> 37:14.320
and... you're right.

37:14.321 --> 37:18.880
I don't want you to move away,
but...

37:18.881 --> 37:20.480
Eli.

37:20.481 --> 37:22.681
This is such
a huge opportunity for you.

37:22.682 --> 37:24.560
You have got to try.

37:24.561 --> 37:25.760
- Mom...

37:25.761 --> 37:28.479
- Look at this crackhead
Christmas tree.

37:28.480 --> 37:29.721
What the fuck is this?

37:29.722 --> 37:31.120
What is this?

37:31.121 --> 37:32.199
- I don't know what that is.

37:32.200 --> 37:33.799
- A golf club with a sock on it?

37:33.800 --> 37:35.279
- Pom... pom
or something like that.

37:35.280 --> 37:37.281
- Yeah, I bet you Tiger
don't do nothing like this.

37:37.282 --> 37:38.680
This is crazy.

37:38.681 --> 37:40.479
- Got to get something
in your belly, sweetie,

37:40.480 --> 37:41.839
or you're gonna get so sick.

37:41.840 --> 37:43.679
- I'm not hungry.
I don't think I want anything.

37:43.680 --> 37:44.879
- Just a second.
Oh, not much.

37:44.880 --> 37:46.479
What's that?
- Hey, Mom?

37:46.480 --> 37:47.999
- Ooh! Oof.
That's not...

37:48.000 --> 37:49.761
Easy, baby.
Let's get you up here, baby.

37:49.762 --> 37:51.600
Up on the counter.
- Okay.

37:51.601 --> 37:54.281
- Oh, my God, we got to lose
those couple of idiots soon.

37:54.282 --> 37:56.200
- Fore!

37:56.201 --> 37:58.480
What you in here cooking, Penny?

37:58.481 --> 37:59.880
- Um...

37:59.881 --> 38:02.079
what are you doing
with my stuff, for God's sake?

38:02.080 --> 38:03.879
- Hey, y'all got any food
up in this joint?

38:03.880 --> 38:05.119
- Just a minute, Black.

38:05.120 --> 38:06.519
- We know
you don't be playing golf.

38:06.520 --> 38:08.679
- Mom, he found the golf club.
- Just put my things down.

38:08.680 --> 38:10.199
- There's actually
a really funny story

38:10.200 --> 38:11.279
about that golf club.

38:11.280 --> 38:12.679
My mom tried
to kill her boyfriend

38:12.680 --> 38:13.759
with one of those golf clubs.

38:13.760 --> 38:15.279
She hit him in the head
with a nine iron.

38:15.280 --> 38:16.281
- It was a seven.

38:16.282 --> 38:17.960
- Ha, ha, whack!
Ow.

38:17.961 --> 38:19.679
I think it maybe
rubbed him the wrong way,

38:19.680 --> 38:21.959
so he left us the house,
and he moved to Florida.

38:21.960 --> 38:23.719
And Mom let him take my piano.

38:23.720 --> 38:25.599
- It was his piano.
- It was my piano too.

38:25.600 --> 38:26.759
- No, not really.
- Well...

38:26.760 --> 38:28.319
- Tried to kill your pops?
- No...

38:28.320 --> 38:30.879
- No, it was just a flesh wound.
- It was a flesh wound.

38:30.880 --> 38:32.959
That's why they gave him
47 stitches.

38:32.960 --> 38:34.439
No, no, no,
she tried to kill Barry.

38:34.440 --> 38:36.361
That's Nicole's father.
- Here you go, eat this.

38:36.362 --> 38:37.600
- What is this?

38:37.601 --> 38:38.961
- It's for your belly, sweetie.

38:38.962 --> 38:41.240
- No, I don't eat jelly.

38:41.241 --> 38:43.161
I don't eat jelly for my belly.

38:43.162 --> 38:44.720
My pops was a junkie.

38:44.721 --> 38:46.120
- Hey, Eli, stop it.

38:46.121 --> 38:47.559
- No, no, no, he was a really...

38:47.560 --> 38:49.359
he was a really talented
and famous guy.

38:49.360 --> 38:50.481
Guess what he was famous for?

38:50.482 --> 38:51.680
- What?

38:51.681 --> 38:53.680
- What?
Being a junkie.

38:53.681 --> 38:55.399
Thanks for everything, Dad,
you jerk-off.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.759
- Eli, just stop it!
- Okay.

38:56.760 --> 38:58.919
- Don't talk about
your dad that way.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.321
He was a great artist,

39:00.322 --> 39:03.560
just like you're gonna be
one day, sweetie.

39:03.561 --> 39:05.680
Now, um,
listen, you guys,

39:05.681 --> 39:09.079
my son has some really important
stuff to do, all right?

39:09.080 --> 39:11.479
So you think
we can just be done here?

39:11.480 --> 39:13.279
- You ain't done with shit.

39:13.280 --> 39:16.201
Your son works for me
all day long, and so do you.

39:16.202 --> 39:18.200
- I'm under his thumb.

39:19.761 --> 39:21.640
Look, Sprink.

39:21.641 --> 39:22.919
I'm not afraid of you.

39:22.920 --> 39:24.881
Nobody in this town
is afraid of you.

39:24.882 --> 39:27.480
Why do you think
I ripped you off?

39:27.481 --> 39:29.201
- Penny, I don't want you
to be afraid of me.

39:29.202 --> 39:30.480
- Oh, good.

39:30.481 --> 39:31.879
- But I do want you
to know this:

39:31.880 --> 39:33.999
I'm not into hitting women,
but I will fuck you up.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.199
- Hey, now, wait a minute.

39:35.200 --> 39:36.719
- Come on, come on,
okay, okay, okay.

39:36.720 --> 39:39.519
Okay, no, please excuse me.
You'll go with us, okay?

39:39.520 --> 39:41.321
Okay, does that satisfy you,
Mr. Drug Dealer?

39:41.322 --> 39:42.560
Mr. Drug Dealers?

39:42.561 --> 39:43.961
No, no, no, no, no.
Mom, it's okay.

39:43.962 --> 39:45.400
They'll come with me.

39:45.401 --> 39:47.479
I'll play the audition
with a stupid club hand, okay?

39:47.480 --> 39:48.879
We'll get these morons
their drugs

39:48.880 --> 39:50.239
so we can
get your stupid ass high,

39:50.240 --> 39:51.519
and then we can go
on an airplane.

39:51.520 --> 39:52.561
Not an airplane.

39:53.841 --> 39:55.399
- No, where are we going?

39:55.400 --> 39:57.319
Oh, yeah, where do we have to...
oh, the audition.

39:57.320 --> 39:59.119
We have to go to the audition.
- Oh, easy, baby.

39:59.120 --> 40:00.199
- Penny!
- Yeah?

40:00.200 --> 40:02.161
- Get something
in that boy's stomach.

40:15.721 --> 40:17.841
Hey, honey, we're here.

40:17.842 --> 40:19.320
Whoa, look alive.

40:19.321 --> 40:21.319
Put your jacket on, Eli.
Your jacket.

40:21.320 --> 40:22.759
Oh, this is going to be great.

40:22.760 --> 40:24.879
Black, what are you doing?
We don't need you in there.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.721
- No, no, I'm not letting you
out of my sight.

40:26.722 --> 40:28.680
- And I'ma be
on your back.

40:28.681 --> 40:29.760
- Oh, fabulous.

40:29.761 --> 40:30.840
Come on, baby.

40:30.841 --> 40:32.079
Let me help you with that.

40:32.080 --> 40:33.239
Here you go.
Easy does it.

40:33.240 --> 40:34.321
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:35.361 --> 40:36.360
Silly, yeah.

40:36.361 --> 40:37.599
- Okay.
- Come on.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.279
Are you gonna be able
to play?

40:39.280 --> 40:40.721
- Yeah, I'm gonna
tear this shit up.

40:41.841 --> 40:43.960
I like this guy.
He's crazy.

40:43.961 --> 40:45.719
Things have changed a lot
since I went here.

40:45.720 --> 40:47.519
- That was a long-ass time ago.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.639
- Wait a second.
You guys went here too?

40:49.640 --> 40:52.841
- Yep, all-state track runner,
two years in a rizzo, izzo.

40:54.401 --> 40:56.079
Wait, you actually ran track?

40:56.080 --> 40:58.319
- Fastest 1,500
in the state qualifiers.

40:58.320 --> 41:00.399
Come on, Penny, don't act
like you don't remember.

41:00.400 --> 41:01.881
You know I was the man.

41:01.882 --> 41:04.600
- Mm-hmm, I bet
you were super quick.

41:04.601 --> 41:06.719
- Look at this dude.
He got on tights, Black!

41:06.720 --> 41:08.441
- Yeah, I like that outfit.

41:08.442 --> 41:10.200
I dig them boots.

41:10.201 --> 41:11.400
- Ridiculous.

41:11.401 --> 41:13.041
Everybody is all dressed up
in costumes.

41:13.042 --> 41:14.440
- Mom, stop.

41:14.441 --> 41:16.279
- No, honey, I'm just going
to walk you in, okay?

41:16.280 --> 41:17.441
- No, no, no.
Don't walk me in.

41:17.442 --> 41:18.720
- What?

41:18.721 --> 41:19.799
- No, no, no, stay here.

41:19.800 --> 41:21.081
Don't come in with me.

41:21.082 --> 41:22.680
No, I'm fine.

41:22.681 --> 41:24.639
Stop, and don't...
don't come in, okay?

41:24.640 --> 41:26.601
Somehow you'd find a way
to screw it all up.

41:26.602 --> 41:27.680
Stay here.

41:27.681 --> 41:29.441
- Okay, no, I'll just be
right here then.

41:29.442 --> 41:31.200
- Okay, fine, sorry.

41:31.201 --> 41:33.240
Thank you.

41:33.241 --> 41:36.080
- Good luck, sweetheart!

41:36.081 --> 41:37.240
- That was harsh.

41:37.241 --> 41:40.080
- Yeah, that was cold-blooded.

41:40.081 --> 41:42.961
- He's just anxious about
his audition, you know.

41:42.962 --> 41:45.960
That's why he's talking
to me like that.

41:45.961 --> 41:48.200
- Black, look, she hurt.

41:48.201 --> 41:52.080
- Just got to deal with it.

41:52.081 --> 41:53.681
- You getting ready to cry?

41:53.682 --> 41:56.440
- No.
- She'll get over it.

41:56.441 --> 41:59.080
- Earthlink.net.

41:59.081 --> 42:00.441
- Look who's here.

42:03.361 --> 42:04.921
They're way off
with their wardrobe,

42:04.922 --> 42:07.320
like, by two centuries.

42:07.321 --> 42:09.560
I mean, it's not even period.

42:09.561 --> 42:11.960
- What... what is he doing here?

42:11.961 --> 42:13.800
Excuse me, sorry.

42:13.801 --> 42:16.160
I'll be right back.

42:17.401 --> 42:18.881
That's a gorgeous bayonet.

42:22.641 --> 42:24.040
- Eli.

42:24.041 --> 42:25.200
Eli.

42:25.201 --> 42:26.520
- Oh, hi.

42:26.521 --> 42:27.719
Hey, what are you doing here?

42:27.720 --> 42:28.879
What the hell are you wearing?

42:28.880 --> 42:29.959
- What?
Oh, no, yeah.

42:29.960 --> 42:31.079
This is the family thing

42:31.080 --> 42:32.439
that I was going to
tell you about

42:32.440 --> 42:33.521
when you hung up on me.

42:33.522 --> 42:36.440
- What is all this
weird shit, Sprink?

42:36.441 --> 42:40.800
All these people
in these clothes and stuff?

42:40.801 --> 42:43.280
- Civil War party.

42:43.281 --> 42:45.761
A bunch of honkies
playing dress-up.

42:49.561 --> 42:51.200
- What's with you?

42:51.201 --> 42:53.639
- My kid, man, you don't know
what this means to him.

42:53.640 --> 42:54.919
It means the world to him.

42:54.920 --> 42:56.639
He's never taken Oxy
like that before.

42:56.640 --> 42:58.479
I mean, I don't know
how he's doing in there.

42:58.480 --> 43:00.679
I don't know what's going on.
I...

43:00.680 --> 43:02.841
- Wait, so you're actually,
like...

43:02.842 --> 43:05.160
like, one of these people?

43:05.161 --> 43:07.080
- Reenactors?
- Yeah.

43:07.081 --> 43:08.841
- Yeah, my mom is a seamstress.

43:08.842 --> 43:11.520
My dad's a captain
in the infantry.

43:11.521 --> 43:13.359
I'm the virginal daughter,
Sarah Collins.

43:13.360 --> 43:15.439
- Really?
You're a virginal daughter?

43:15.440 --> 43:16.601
That seems kind of...

43:16.602 --> 43:18.040
No, I'm kidding.

43:18.041 --> 43:20.759
It seems like a really nice
organization for you guys.

43:20.760 --> 43:22.881
- Yeah, we get to dress up,
be different people.

43:22.882 --> 43:23.920
It's fun.

43:23.921 --> 43:25.359
- I'd like to try that.

43:25.360 --> 43:27.681
I'm kind of
dressing up too today.

43:27.682 --> 43:29.720
- What happened to your hand?

43:29.721 --> 43:32.240
- Yeah, I actually, uh,

43:32.241 --> 43:35.000
actually, uh...
actually fell.

43:35.001 --> 43:36.679
Shit, I don't know how
I'm going to play.

43:36.680 --> 43:38.399
I got an audition for a piano.

43:38.400 --> 43:40.479
I mean, I got a...
what am I doing?

43:40.480 --> 43:41.681
Wait, what is going on?

43:41.682 --> 43:43.240
No, no, I have a...

43:43.241 --> 43:47.760
I have a piano audition
for a piano school,

43:47.761 --> 43:50.319
for a, um...
for a music conservatory,

43:50.320 --> 43:52.799
and it's, like, right now,
so I got to...

43:52.800 --> 43:54.361
- Let me help you.
Here.

43:54.362 --> 43:57.000
- Okay.
Thanks.

43:57.001 --> 43:59.480
- Are you nervous?

43:59.481 --> 44:02.640
- No, I mean,
it's just an audition.

44:02.641 --> 44:05.640
I probably won't even get in.

44:05.641 --> 44:07.681
- Maybe you will.

44:11.601 --> 44:13.440
- Am I okay?

44:13.441 --> 44:16.320
- Yeah.

44:16.321 --> 44:18.560
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

44:18.561 --> 44:21.600
- Okay.

44:21.601 --> 44:25.160
- Why don't you go in there
and check on your boy?

44:25.161 --> 44:26.361
Well, you're his mother.

44:26.362 --> 44:29.280
You shouldn't be
out here worrying.

44:29.281 --> 44:30.761
- You're right about that.

44:30.762 --> 44:32.760
I'm going in.

44:32.761 --> 44:33.920
- Me too.

44:33.921 --> 44:36.279
They probably still got
my picture hanging.

44:36.280 --> 44:38.159
- All right, I'll stay out here
with the car.

44:38.160 --> 44:39.601
- I'll be right back, Black!

44:39.602 --> 44:40.801
- Yeah.

44:45.161 --> 44:49.080
Hey, Miss Muffet, let me have
one of them sandwiches.

44:49.081 --> 44:50.841
Give me a sandwich.

45:19.681 --> 45:20.800
- Okay.

45:29.281 --> 45:30.719
Hey.
- You're almost late.

45:30.720 --> 45:32.319
Are you trying to make me
nervous or what?

45:32.320 --> 45:33.319
- I'm here.
I'm here.

45:33.320 --> 45:34.359
- What's with the hand?

45:34.360 --> 45:35.801
- Nothing, nothing.
I'm fine.

45:37.401 --> 45:40.320
- I've been teaching
for 15 years.

45:40.321 --> 45:41.679
In all of that time,

45:41.680 --> 45:44.081
you are one of three
or four students

45:44.082 --> 45:46.160
who had a true gift.

45:47.241 --> 45:49.200
- Really.
- Okay.

45:49.201 --> 45:51.560
- Special.

45:51.561 --> 45:53.200
You're the one.

45:53.201 --> 45:54.960
- Okay.

45:54.961 --> 45:56.880
Eli!

45:56.881 --> 45:59.680
Stop fucking up.

45:59.681 --> 46:02.840
- Okay.
Okay.

46:02.841 --> 46:04.760
Okay.

46:04.761 --> 46:06.760
- Thank you.

46:06.761 --> 46:08.520
Eli Bloom.

46:08.521 --> 46:09.841
Yeah, hi.

46:12.841 --> 46:15.240
- This is Eli Bloom.

46:15.241 --> 46:16.560
- Okay, scram.

46:16.561 --> 46:18.040
Hey, so...

46:18.041 --> 46:19.399
- I'm Jennifer Michaels.

46:19.400 --> 46:21.361
This is Mr. Spinelli,
and this is Miss Crane...

46:59.161 --> 47:00.961
Ow.
Oh, shit.

47:35.841 --> 47:37.440
Shit, fuck.

47:37.441 --> 47:38.761
I can't play like this.

47:40.761 --> 47:42.640
- Do you need help?

47:43.761 --> 47:46.360
Oh, bravo!

47:46.361 --> 47:48.001
- Mom, what the hell
are you doing here?

47:48.002 --> 47:49.120
- I am so proud.

47:49.121 --> 47:50.559
- I think you need some help.
- No, no.

47:50.560 --> 47:51.759
- Don't worry.
I'll get help.

47:51.760 --> 47:53.199
I'm his mother.
Wasn't he wonderful?

47:53.200 --> 47:54.999
- Hey, shut up.
- Eli, you okay?

47:55.000 --> 47:56.119
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Yeah.

47:56.120 --> 47:57.639
Thanks a lot
for the audition, Dave.

47:57.640 --> 48:00.039
Thanks for squeezing me in,
and, um, well, don't call us.

48:00.040 --> 48:01.079
We'll call you, I guess.

48:01.080 --> 48:02.119
- Oh, easy, easy, baby.

48:02.120 --> 48:03.559
- We gotta go 'cause you see,

48:03.560 --> 48:05.559
my mom's got a drug dealer
waiting for us in the car.

48:05.560 --> 48:07.079
Oh, no, you know what?
He's right here.

48:07.080 --> 48:08.479
- He's a friend.
- 'Sup?

48:08.480 --> 48:10.481
- Yeah, we gotta go do
some gangster shit, but, uh...

48:10.482 --> 48:11.760
- Eli!

48:11.761 --> 48:13.561
- But you said I'm the one,
right, Dave?

48:13.562 --> 48:14.840
I'm the one!

48:14.841 --> 48:16.361
- Gotta make a pick-up.

48:19.561 --> 48:21.081
- He's having a rough day.

48:21.082 --> 48:22.760
- That boy got talent!

48:22.761 --> 48:23.801
- You got that right.

48:26.241 --> 48:28.960
Eli, slow down!
You were fantastic!

48:28.961 --> 48:30.399
- You the man on the keys,
Mozart!

48:30.400 --> 48:31.641
- Amazing!
- I ruined it.

48:31.642 --> 48:34.040
- No, Eli, you were wonderful!

48:34.041 --> 48:35.081
- I wasn't.
Shut up.

48:35.082 --> 48:36.320
- Eli.
- What?

48:36.321 --> 48:38.320
- You... Sprinkles saw it.

48:38.321 --> 48:40.841
You should have seen the look
on their faces, sweetheart.

48:40.842 --> 48:42.040
They loved you.

48:42.041 --> 48:43.719
- They loved me?
What planet do you live on?

48:43.720 --> 48:45.559
Even when you're not high,
you're still high.

48:45.560 --> 48:48.519
- Okay, hold on,
let me show you something.

48:48.520 --> 48:50.081
- You talk to him, Sprink.

48:52.921 --> 48:54.440
- What?
- Eli.

48:54.441 --> 49:00.120
- Yeah.
- That's me, my junior year.

49:00.121 --> 49:01.760
- That's you!

49:01.761 --> 49:03.520
- I won state.

49:03.521 --> 49:05.680
Almost nationals.

49:05.681 --> 49:06.801
- Wait.
Leopold Leonard?

49:06.802 --> 49:08.520
That's your name?

49:08.521 --> 49:09.679
- My mother gave me that name.

49:09.680 --> 49:11.079
You got a problem with it?

49:11.080 --> 49:13.199
- After all, Sprinkles is
a pretty stupid name,

49:13.200 --> 49:14.561
you know what I mean?

49:14.562 --> 49:15.720
- Penny, shut up.

49:15.721 --> 49:17.119
At least I have a trophy.

49:17.120 --> 49:19.961
And I still got the record
for the 100-meter dash.

49:19.962 --> 49:22.120
What's your legacy?

49:22.121 --> 49:23.839
- I'm sorry, man,
really, truly.

49:23.840 --> 49:25.841
Just tell the kid what you know.

49:25.842 --> 49:27.081
Go on.

49:28.401 --> 49:30.561
Go on.

49:31.801 --> 49:34.920
- I ran anchor
on that relay team.

49:34.921 --> 49:37.160
Came back from behind.

49:37.161 --> 49:39.360
Won the shit for us.

49:39.361 --> 49:41.319
They never let me
hold the trophy.

49:41.320 --> 49:42.559
- That is so wrong.

49:42.560 --> 49:44.281
- Never gave me the glory.

49:51.521 --> 49:54.560
- Yo, fuck the past, man.
- Yeah.

49:54.561 --> 49:57.160
- Fuck the past.

49:57.161 --> 49:58.480
- Fuck the system.

49:58.481 --> 50:00.080
- Fuck my fucking hand.

50:00.081 --> 50:01.120
- Fuck it.

50:01.121 --> 50:02.720
- Yeah, fuck it, man.

50:02.721 --> 50:03.760
- Fuck it!

50:03.761 --> 50:05.121
- Fucking hand!
Fuck it all!

50:05.122 --> 50:06.360
- Fuck the past!

50:06.361 --> 50:07.761
- Fuck it all!
- Fuck everything.

50:07.762 --> 50:09.880
- Motherfucker!

50:11.601 --> 50:13.600
- Go, Leopold!

50:13.601 --> 50:15.800
Go, man, go!

50:28.281 --> 50:30.319
- So what is this now?
Robbery?

50:30.320 --> 50:31.519
- This is my trophy.
I won it.

50:31.520 --> 50:32.679
I own it.
It's mines.

50:34.282 --> 50:35.360
- Hello!

50:35.361 --> 50:36.519
<i>- Eli, where'd you go?</i>
- Dave.

50:36.520 --> 50:37.559
- Thou shalt not steal.

50:37.560 --> 50:38.879
- Wait, they want me
to come back?

50:38.880 --> 50:40.159
No, I was terrible... today?

50:40.160 --> 50:41.639
- Eli, who's that?
- Sorry, uh, wait.

50:41.640 --> 50:43.119
No, I don't think
I can come back today.

50:43.120 --> 50:44.239
- You know, it's not stealing

50:44.240 --> 50:45.559
if it's yours
in the first place.

50:45.560 --> 50:46.799
- Bullshit.
- Thank you, Penny.

50:46.800 --> 50:47.959
I appreciate that.

50:47.960 --> 50:49.639
- I mean, really,
he just took what was his.

50:49.640 --> 50:50.799
- I gotta go.
I'm sorry, Dave.

50:50.800 --> 50:51.799
I got another call.

50:51.800 --> 50:52.921
- Damn $2 trophy.
- Hello?

50:52.922 --> 50:54.240
Oh, hi, hi.
<i>Hola.</i>

50:54.241 --> 50:56.280
Yes, <i>hola.</i>
Okay, yeah.

50:56.281 --> 50:57.561
<i>Como esta?</i>
- Hey, is that our guy?

50:57.562 --> 50:58.800
Is it on?

50:58.801 --> 51:00.639
- Your piano teacher?
- Will you please shut up?

51:00.640 --> 51:01.959
- What did he want?
- Sprink.

51:01.960 --> 51:04.159
- Sorry, hi, okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:04.160 --> 51:05.639
- What did Dave want,
though, honey?

51:05.640 --> 51:06.761
- Yeah, yeah. <i>Sí.
Sí, sí, sí.</i>

51:06.762 --> 51:07.800
<i>Yo entiendo.</i>

51:07.801 --> 51:10.400
<i>Llegaramos alli pronto.</i>

51:10.401 --> 51:11.599
Okay.
All right, <i>sí, gracias.</i>

51:11.600 --> 51:12.959
- Who's that
on the phone, Mozart?

51:12.960 --> 51:14.159
<i>- Adios.</i>
- Who's that?

51:14.160 --> 51:15.999
Is that our connect?
- Yeah, that was Eduardo.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.159
He said the stuffs ready.

51:17.160 --> 51:18.839
We gotta go over there
and pick this shit up

51:18.840 --> 51:19.879
and get it over with.

51:19.880 --> 51:21.001
- We gotta go pick up Nicole.

51:21.002 --> 51:22.640
- Who's Nicole?

51:22.641 --> 51:24.600
- Yeah, who's Nicole?

51:24.601 --> 51:26.319
They're not coming.

51:26.320 --> 51:27.601
Yes, they are.

51:27.602 --> 51:28.880
- Nicole.

51:28.881 --> 51:30.000
Cut that out.

51:30.001 --> 51:32.040
- They would never forget me.

51:32.041 --> 51:33.920
Wanna bet?

51:33.921 --> 51:35.399
They've abandoned you.

51:35.400 --> 51:36.519
And now you're homeless.

51:36.520 --> 51:37.561
- Nicole.
Stop that.

51:38.721 --> 51:40.000
- Stop what?

51:40.001 --> 51:41.521
- Your sock puppet thing.
It's weird.

51:41.522 --> 51:42.560
Here they come.

51:42.561 --> 51:43.879
- Yo, yo, Nicole.
Get in the car.

51:43.880 --> 51:45.159
- Come on, sweetie!

51:45.160 --> 51:46.641
- Yo, guys, open the door.
Be polite.

51:46.642 --> 51:47.680
- Bye, Nicole.

51:47.681 --> 51:48.799
- No, Nicole, get in the back.

51:48.800 --> 51:50.159
- Say hello to the nice men.

51:50.160 --> 51:51.199
- Where are you going?

51:51.200 --> 51:52.399
We're taking her to Tricia's.

51:52.400 --> 51:53.679
- I can't go there.
- Why?

51:53.680 --> 51:54.839
She hates you, not Nicole.

51:54.840 --> 51:55.999
- She treats me like trash.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.399
She thinks I'm a bad mother.

51:57.400 --> 51:59.681
- Oh, yeah, well, she's totally
out of touch with reality.

51:59.682 --> 52:00.920
- She's my sister.

52:00.921 --> 52:03.800
Who are you?
- I'm Black.

52:03.801 --> 52:05.241
- I can see you're black.

52:05.242 --> 52:06.840
What's your name?

52:06.841 --> 52:08.120
- It's Black.

52:08.121 --> 52:11.041
- Black, black, black,
black-ety, black, black.

52:11.042 --> 52:13.400
- Nicole, shut up.

52:13.401 --> 52:14.921
Mom, this puppet thing
is a problem.

52:14.922 --> 52:16.480
- Julio is her friend.

52:16.481 --> 52:18.200
- That's a stupid trophy.

52:18.201 --> 52:20.280
- Nicole, shut up, okay?

52:20.281 --> 52:23.201
- You stupid,
talking through that puppet.

52:23.202 --> 52:24.320
Weirdo.

52:24.321 --> 52:25.960
- I'm not stupid.

52:25.961 --> 52:27.321
Guess what.
- Hey, Nicole.

52:27.322 --> 52:29.120
- What?
- Chicken butt.

52:29.121 --> 52:30.759
You dummy.
Chicken butthead.

52:30.760 --> 52:32.679
- You need to learn
how to respect your elders.

52:32.680 --> 52:35.159
Hey, y'all need to teach this
girl back here some manners.

52:35.160 --> 52:36.559
- Her manners are fine.

52:36.560 --> 52:38.079
- Mom, don't baby her, okay?

52:38.080 --> 52:40.079
- You need to teach this girl
some manners, huh?

52:40.080 --> 52:42.521
You need to teach yourself
how to go on a diet, fatty.

52:42.522 --> 52:44.160
♪ Fatty, fatty, fatty ♪

52:44.161 --> 52:45.399
- You're gonna learn now.

52:45.400 --> 52:47.119
Ow!
You're hurting Julio!

52:47.120 --> 52:48.119
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Mommy!

52:48.120 --> 52:49.159
- Nicole.
- Eli!

52:49.160 --> 52:50.239
- Let go!
- Say you're sorry!

52:50.240 --> 52:51.239
- Nicole, say it.
- No!

52:51.240 --> 52:52.359
- Say you're sorry!
- No!

52:52.360 --> 52:53.999
- Black, chill.
- Say you're sorry!

52:54.000 --> 52:55.159
- No, I'm not!
- Say it!

52:55.160 --> 52:56.599
- Let go of my daughter!

52:56.600 --> 52:58.039
Let go, fatty!
- Nicole!

52:58.040 --> 52:59.879
- Coley, are you all right?
- Black, chill out!

52:59.880 --> 53:01.319
- Say it!
- Nicole, say you're sorry!

53:01.320 --> 53:02.719
No, I'm not sorry!

53:02.720 --> 53:04.041
- Black, you let go of her!

53:04.042 --> 53:06.000
- No!
No!

53:06.001 --> 53:08.440
- Problem solved.
- No!

53:08.441 --> 53:10.840
- I am gonna kick your ass!

53:10.841 --> 53:13.000
- You want a lesson too?

53:13.001 --> 53:14.800
I didn't think so!

53:14.801 --> 53:17.640
Drive the damn car!

53:17.641 --> 53:20.159
Discipline's gone
out the window these days.

53:20.160 --> 53:21.439
- Sometime I be bugging on you.

53:21.440 --> 53:23.599
Why are you arguing with... you...
a little girl?

53:23.600 --> 53:24.919
- I didn't do nothing!

53:24.920 --> 53:26.199
She back here with a sock.

53:26.200 --> 53:28.319
- Exactly!
She got a sock on her hand!

53:28.320 --> 53:29.479
- I didn't do nothing!

53:29.480 --> 53:30.879
- The girl is... something wrong!

53:30.880 --> 53:32.279
Borderline psychotic, whatever...

53:32.280 --> 53:33.279
- Go inside the house.

53:33.280 --> 53:34.279
Lock the doors.
Hurry.

53:34.280 --> 53:35.319
- Hey, Aunt Trish.

53:35.320 --> 53:36.559
- She started
messing with me.

53:36.560 --> 53:37.799
- Just a couple of hours.

53:37.800 --> 53:39.479
That's all we need her for,
all right?

53:39.480 --> 53:41.479
And do not let her
talk trash about me.

53:41.480 --> 53:42.719
- I don't control her.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.399
Hey, Trishie, I was wondering

53:44.400 --> 53:45.959
if you could watch Nicole
for a few hours?

53:45.960 --> 53:47.759
- I thought you were
coming over to practice.

53:47.760 --> 53:49.319
Oh, my God, what happened
to your hand?

53:49.320 --> 53:50.761
- No, no, nothing, nothing.
I'm fine.

53:50.762 --> 53:52.960
- Oh, look at this.
Here we go.

53:52.961 --> 53:54.160
This is...

53:54.161 --> 53:55.279
- I want Julio, though!

53:55.280 --> 53:56.919
- I know, baby,
but this is Mario.

53:56.920 --> 53:57.919
He's Julio's brother.

53:57.920 --> 53:58.959
- But I want Julio.

53:58.960 --> 54:00.119
- Yeah, I know you do, honey...

54:00.120 --> 54:01.159
- Who are those guys?

54:01.160 --> 54:02.479
- No, they're, uh...

54:02.480 --> 54:04.319
they're my colleagues
from the supermarket.

54:04.320 --> 54:05.361
They're good guys.

54:05.362 --> 54:07.360
Hey, guys!
How's it going?

54:07.361 --> 54:10.760
This is, uh-
that's Terry and Marty.

54:10.761 --> 54:11.960
They're fine.

54:11.961 --> 54:14.319
- There we go!
Look, look, look, look, look.

54:14.320 --> 54:15.839
There's Mario!

54:15.840 --> 54:19.319
- I told you I didn't want
to see your mother here again.

54:19.320 --> 54:21.439
Every time she comes,
she causes some kind of drama.

54:21.440 --> 54:23.839
The last time she was here,
she completely ruined Christmas.

54:23.840 --> 54:24.999
- Trish, please, okay?

54:25.000 --> 54:26.519
Please don't do this now,
all right?

54:26.520 --> 54:27.839
Just watch Nicole
for a few hours.

54:27.840 --> 54:28.959
Don't ask me why.

54:28.960 --> 54:30.359
Don't give me a problem,
not today.

54:30.360 --> 54:31.919
I'm not in the mood.
Please just do this.

54:31.920 --> 54:33.199
- Okay, all right, E.
I'm sorry.

54:33.200 --> 54:34.359
- All right.
- I'll watch her.

54:34.360 --> 54:35.359
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

54:35.360 --> 54:36.359
- All right, thanks a lot.

54:36.360 --> 54:38.241
Hey, Coley, come on.

54:38.242 --> 54:39.680
- You see, baby?

54:39.681 --> 54:42.000
He says, "Hello, Nicole."

54:42.001 --> 54:43.880
- I want Julio!

54:43.881 --> 54:46.041
- Ah, sweetie,
it'll be okay, okay?

54:46.042 --> 54:48.440
You go play with Cousin Stevie.

54:48.441 --> 54:49.721
- Mom!
Just say good-bye.

54:49.722 --> 54:51.840
- Go on, sweetie.
It's okay.

54:51.841 --> 54:53.641
- Hey, they got
a nice place here, bop.

54:53.642 --> 54:54.880
- It's butter.

54:54.881 --> 54:57.359
We should come back
and rob this motherfucker.

54:57.360 --> 54:59.561
- All right, good.
There you go.

54:59.562 --> 55:01.880
Have a good time.
Thank you.

55:01.881 --> 55:03.000
- Hi, baby.

55:03.001 --> 55:04.199
- All right, come on, let's go.

55:04.200 --> 55:05.759
Get in the car.
- What'd she say about me?

55:05.760 --> 55:07.239
- She didn't
say anything about you.

55:07.240 --> 55:08.879
- What do you mean
she didn't say anything?

55:08.880 --> 55:10.801
- You're not the center
of everybody's universe.

55:10.802 --> 55:11.920
Get in the car.

55:11.921 --> 55:13.599
- Want me to clobber
the bitch with my cane?

55:13.600 --> 55:15.639
- Slash the bitch's tires?
- Now, that's a good idea.

55:15.640 --> 55:17.241
- Obviously not.
Get in the car, come on.

55:17.242 --> 55:19.720
- All right.

55:19.721 --> 55:21.400
Watch out for the paint.

55:21.401 --> 55:23.559
- If you got a bat,
I'll put a knot on her head.

55:23.560 --> 55:25.641
- Yeah, I'll get her
pregnant on purpose.

55:25.642 --> 55:26.681
- Mm-hmm.

55:28.761 --> 55:30.601
- Come on in.
- Everybody in?

55:33.880 --> 55:34.921
Oh, my God!
- Come on, man.

55:36.561 --> 55:38.639
Let's get this bitch running!
- Come on, don't worry.

55:38.640 --> 55:40.081
The car's fine,
for crying out loud.

55:40.082 --> 55:41.280
It's fine!

55:41.281 --> 55:42.881
- We weren't supposed
to go in your car!

55:42.882 --> 55:44.800
- It's fine!

55:44.801 --> 55:48.520
- You need a new alternator
in this motherfucker.

55:48.521 --> 55:50.360
Let's go, Penny!

55:50.361 --> 55:52.640
Don't make me turn it up to 10.

55:52.641 --> 55:54.721
- What do you think
you're gonna turn up to 10?

55:57.281 --> 56:00.039
- So, Eli, where you learn
to speak Spanish?

56:00.040 --> 56:01.759
- I learned in middle school,
high school.

56:01.760 --> 56:03.119
- You fluent?
- Yeah.

56:03.120 --> 56:04.601
- You eat <i>bacalao</i>
and all of that?

56:04.602 --> 56:06.640
- What is that?
- It's fish.

56:06.641 --> 56:07.961
- Oh, yeah, I eat fish.

56:07.962 --> 56:09.241
- Spanish fish.

56:54.361 --> 56:55.559
- All right, gracias.

56:55.560 --> 56:57.241
He says to go, uh,
in the back with that guy.

56:57.242 --> 56:58.240
They're ready.

56:58.241 --> 56:59.241
- Cool.
- All right.

57:21.521 --> 57:23.361
- What's he talking about?
- Uh, nothing...

57:25.321 --> 57:26.681
He wants to dance with you.

57:26.682 --> 57:29.441
- Oh, I don't dance.
Thanks, I'm good.

57:32.361 --> 57:35.240
- It's not a choice.
You gotta go.

57:35.241 --> 57:37.041
What is he on about?

57:37.042 --> 57:38.360
- Have a good time.

57:38.361 --> 57:41.241
- What did you say to him?
- I don't know.

57:41.242 --> 57:44.280
Uh, <i>tequila, por favor.</i>
- You got it.

57:44.281 --> 57:45.881
- He asked me, all right?

57:56.521 --> 57:57.921
- Here you go.

58:06.041 --> 58:09.720
- I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

58:09.721 --> 58:11.841
- No, it's-
my son speaks Spanish.

58:11.842 --> 58:13.841
I don't understand.

58:22.641 --> 58:23.841
- Oh, my God.

58:26.881 --> 58:28.001
- Oh, that feels kinda nice.

58:30.161 --> 58:32.200
- My man, Mozart.

58:32.201 --> 58:33.800
What you slurping on?

58:33.801 --> 58:35.760
- Uh, tequila.

58:35.761 --> 58:37.920
- Nice, get me one.

58:37.921 --> 58:39.440
- All right.
Black?

58:39.441 --> 58:40.559
- He don't drink.

58:40.560 --> 58:41.881
- That shit'll fuck you up.

58:41.882 --> 58:43.120
I drink pop.

58:43.121 --> 58:44.400
- All right.

58:44.401 --> 58:47.120
<i>Dos tequilas, por favor.</i>

58:48.721 --> 58:50.441
- Me and Sprinkles drinking.

58:54.041 --> 58:55.121
- Yep.
- You ready?

58:55.122 --> 58:56.680
- Yeah.

58:56.681 --> 58:58.080
Mmm!

58:58.081 --> 59:01.640
Ah-a h-ha-ha-ha-haaaa!

59:01.641 --> 59:02.960
That's nice, right?

59:02.961 --> 59:04.801
- Yeah.
- I'll have another.

59:04.802 --> 59:07.200
Preciosa, two tequilas.

59:07.201 --> 59:09.640
And your phone number.

59:09.641 --> 59:11.480
Yo, Mozart.
- Yo.

59:11.481 --> 59:12.801
- How do you become this, like,

59:12.802 --> 59:17.120
this crazy music genius kid,
man?

59:17.121 --> 59:19.000
- Crazy, maybe.

59:19.001 --> 59:20.520
I'm not a genius.

59:20.521 --> 59:22.560
- No?
- No.

59:22.561 --> 59:24.760
- No, I'm not buying that.

59:24.761 --> 59:27.400
Not even for two dollars.

59:27.401 --> 59:28.799
Nobody does anything great

59:28.800 --> 59:30.481
without they heart
not being into it.

59:30.482 --> 59:33.480
What I want to know is,

59:33.481 --> 59:35.401
what does that do
for your heart?

59:41.601 --> 59:45.000
- It lets me disappear.

59:45.001 --> 59:46.440
- I get it.

59:46.441 --> 59:48.681
- Yeah, I imagine it's the same
when you run a race, right?

59:48.682 --> 59:52.240
Like, what do you think about?

59:52.241 --> 59:55.080
- Nothing.
Just the finish line.

59:55.081 --> 59:57.000
- Yeah, and I know.

59:57.001 --> 59:59.560
The finish line, but...

59:59.561 --> 01:00:03.200
for that minute and a half,

01:00:03.201 --> 01:00:05.600
what do you think about?

01:00:05.601 --> 01:00:08.080
- Think about nothin'.

01:00:08.081 --> 01:00:09.401
I just ran.

01:00:10.681 --> 01:00:12.481
- There you go.

01:00:15.601 --> 01:00:17.401
- You're a smart little fucker.

01:00:18.841 --> 01:00:20.720
Yeah.

01:00:20.721 --> 01:00:22.001
I'm so smart.

01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:28.801
So you got something for me?
For my mom?

01:00:37.921 --> 01:00:39.961
Thanks.

01:00:43.241 --> 01:00:47.000
You like doing this
for a living?

01:00:47.001 --> 01:00:50.600
- Mozart, I don't know.

01:00:50.601 --> 01:00:52.721
I've walked that road,
and I've traveled that path,

01:00:52.722 --> 01:00:54.760
but I'm okay with it.

01:00:54.761 --> 01:00:58.080
You, youngblood,

01:00:58.081 --> 01:00:59.960
You got a gift.

01:00:59.961 --> 01:01:04.720
You gotta fight
for what you love, man.

01:01:04.721 --> 01:01:08.120
You understand me?

01:01:08.121 --> 01:01:10.921
Don't ever lay down,
not even once.

01:01:13.921 --> 01:01:18.680
If you do...

01:01:18.681 --> 01:01:22.680
you'll never get back up.

01:01:22.681 --> 01:01:23.761
Mm!

01:01:28.561 --> 01:01:30.641
- That was really nice.
Thank you.

01:01:30.642 --> 01:01:33.280
More fun
than I would have imagined.

01:01:33.281 --> 01:01:35.960
Thank you.

01:01:35.961 --> 01:01:37.440
Thank you very much.

01:01:37.441 --> 01:01:40.680
Yeah.
Absolutely.

01:01:40.681 --> 01:01:42.159
Come on, baby.
I danced real good.

01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.319
- No, no, listen, hold on.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:44.959
Listen, we got to go
in the bathroom first

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.039
and do this, okay?

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.359
- I don't need to do that, baby.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.639
I have not felt this good
in a long, long time.

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:50.959
I feel great.
I'm gonna be fine.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.639
- Whoa... you're gonna be fine?
- Totally.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.799
- What are you talking about?
I'm not asking you, okay?

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.959
I'm telling you, okay?
You're gonna go in the bathroom.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.759
You're gonna do this.
We're gonna go to rehab.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.799
I don't care if I have to force
this down your throat.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.399
- First of all, sweetie,
you don't eat it.

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:03.479
You snort it up your nose.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.679
- Whoa,
don't... don't touch me.

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:05.999
I don't care
what you do with it.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.719
Just put it in your body, okay?

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:09.999
- You don't understand, Eli.
I don't need to go to rehab.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.399
For crying out loud, I'm clean,
and I can stay clean on my own.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:13.639
There's nothing to worry about.

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:14.759
- I am not doing this!

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:16.439
I am not having
this conversation with you

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:17.999
for literally
the one millionth time!

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.719
- Oh, come on.
You've got a drinking problem.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.161
You want to have
that conversation?

01:02:21.162 --> 01:02:22.200
- No, I don't.

01:02:22.201 --> 01:02:23.759
- You get wasted
every single weekend,

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.079
two, three times a week.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.999
You're sucking down tequila
right now, sweetie.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.079
You know what I think, Eli?
I think you have a problem.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:30.639
So why don't you
go into the bathroom?

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:32.039
You do the drugs,
and you go to rehab,

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.119
because I am fine!

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.161
- You are not fine!

01:02:34.162 --> 01:02:36.520
You are a liar.

01:02:36.521 --> 01:02:40.280
And you are a junkie.

01:02:40.281 --> 01:02:41.521
- Eli.

01:02:44.361 --> 01:02:45.601
- Eli, what the...

01:03:24.321 --> 01:03:25.759
- You!
Let those prisoners go!

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.801
- Take your British
hands off me.

01:03:27.802 --> 01:03:30.680
- Chloe! Hey!
Hey, Chloe!

01:03:30.681 --> 01:03:32.000
- Eli?
- Chloe.

01:03:32.001 --> 01:03:33.360
- Eli!
- Chloe.

01:03:33.361 --> 01:03:34.400
Hey.
Hi.

01:03:34.401 --> 01:03:35.399
Why are you tied up?

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.439
Do you want me to free you?

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:37.519
- Yes, free us.
- Shut up!

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:38.959
We're part of the story.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.559
The British burned down my house
and kidnapped me and my sister.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.401
- Oh, my God.
Are your... are your parents okay?

01:03:43.402 --> 01:03:44.920
- My dad got shot.

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:47.119
My mom's missing, and they stole
all of our livestock.

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.079
- Really?
All the livestock?

01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.239
- Yes!
- Oh, no. Wow.

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.079
God, all those poor cows
and chickens, Jesus.

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.239
Well, that's terrible,
and the British are assholes.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:55.319
I hope they lose.

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.561
- How was the audition?

01:03:56.562 --> 01:03:57.920
- Uh, not so good,

01:03:57.921 --> 01:03:59.279
but I'm... I'm so glad
I found you.

01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:00.799
- Young sir,
stand down there.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.919
- Uh, yeah, me too, but, Eli,
you should not be here.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:04.439
This is, like, a big part
of the event,

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.921
and I don't want
to piss anybody off.

01:04:05.922 --> 01:04:07.000
- Back away!

01:04:07.001 --> 01:04:08.599
- You are, like,
this beam of white light.

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.439
You have no idea.
- Stand down, young hooligan!

01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:11.919
- Stop, no, seriously,
you are, like,

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:14.319
this little revolutionary
semi-virginal angel.

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.441
It is so adorable.

01:04:16.441 --> 01:04:17.640
- Um...

01:04:17.641 --> 01:04:19.359
That's really sweet, Eli.
I like you too.

01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:21.719
I mean, I've always liked you.
But you cannot be here.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.321
They're gonna burn you alive
if you stay.

01:04:23.322 --> 01:04:24.600
- I told you away!

01:04:24.601 --> 01:04:26.399
- Why can't I stay here?
Why can't I stay here?

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.959
I could be
the strapping young peasant

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:28.999
trying to win the affection

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.519
of the golden virgin,
Sarah Collins.

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:32.719
I could rip my clothes
and rub dirt on my face

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:33.759
and be someone else.

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.799
I could be someone else too!

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:35.879
- Stand down from the wagon!

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:36.961
- You're not dressed right!

01:04:36.962 --> 01:04:38.240
It's really sweet

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:40.001
that you want to be
a part of this, but not now.

01:04:40.002 --> 01:04:41.120
Maybe next year.

01:04:41.121 --> 01:04:42.559
My dad can always use
a good soldier!

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:43.559
- Okay.
- You! Step away!

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.679
- Wait, wait, do you remember

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.119
when we were
in eighth grade biology

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.879
and I asked you if
it was a maple leaf or an oak?

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:48.959
- Don't hurt him!

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.559
- No, no, I knew what kind
of leaf it was.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.001
You said maple,
but it wasn't a maple,

01:04:52.002 --> 01:04:53.640
and it wasn't an oak.

01:04:53.641 --> 01:04:56.200
It was a sumac!
It was a sumac tree.

01:04:56.201 --> 01:04:58.200
And I knew what it was,

01:04:58.201 --> 01:05:00.039
but I figured if
I asked you enough questions,

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.119
you'd have to talk to me
at some point, because...

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:03.321
please, please let me go...

01:05:03.322 --> 01:05:06.800
because I thought
you were so beautiful.

01:05:06.801 --> 01:05:07.920
- Be gone!

01:05:07.921 --> 01:05:09.079
- Cajole that wagon right now!

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.479
- I'm going, all right?
I surrender.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:11.599
Okay, okay, okay.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.959
- Come back later!
I'll be here.

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.999
- Okay, good-bye, Sarah Collins!

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.281
- Okay, don't push me.

01:05:16.282 --> 01:05:17.480
Bye, piano man.

01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:21.680
- I'm sorry if I ruined
your war, everybody.

01:05:21.681 --> 01:05:24.600
All right.

01:05:24.601 --> 01:05:26.839
- That was so romantic.
- Oh, my God, I know.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.679
I never expected
anything like that.

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:30.441
- I mean, it's like
he learned how to be hot.

01:05:30.442 --> 01:05:31.520
- Um, yeah.

01:05:36.601 --> 01:05:38.159
- Hello?
<i>- Eli, I'm gonna kill her!</i>

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:39.279
- Whoa.
<i>- Get over here!</i>

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.481
- Wait, Mom.
Mom, slow down.

01:05:40.482 --> 01:05:41.480
<i>- Hurry up!</i>

01:05:41.481 --> 01:05:42.679
- Okay, all right, okay.

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:45.161
Just don't do
anything stupid, okay?

01:05:45.162 --> 01:05:47.720
- Take aim!
Fire!

01:06:04.481 --> 01:06:05.999
- You're acting insane!

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.281
- That's my daughter!

01:06:07.282 --> 01:06:08.800
Oh, Eli!
Thank God!

01:06:08.801 --> 01:06:10.841
She has Nicole locked in there!

01:06:10.842 --> 01:06:12.240
- Oh, Jesus.

01:06:12.241 --> 01:06:14.721
- All right, I came over here
just to get my daughter, right?

01:06:14.722 --> 01:06:15.760
- Yeah.

01:06:15.761 --> 01:06:17.119
And, Eli...
- What?

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.119
- She is not coming out of here.
I'll tell you that.

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.319
- Hey!
- Shut up!

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.639
- Hey, Mom.
- She says to me.

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:22.919
Eli, listen to me!
- What?

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:24.759
- She says that Nicole
would be better off

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.079
living here with her!

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.481
- Yeah,
that's absolutely insane.

01:06:27.482 --> 01:06:29.400
- Exactly what I'm saying.

01:06:29.401 --> 01:06:30.559
What?
- Calm down, okay?

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.079
And go over here.
Go over here.

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.279
Trish?
Come on out of there.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.759
- I just want
to take Nicole home.

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.479
- I absolutely will not.
I am afraid of her.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:37.959
- She's afraid of you.
- Afraid of me?

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.399
- Yes, afraid of you.
- What did I do?

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:40.841
- Look at yourself!
Now, calm down.

01:06:40.842 --> 01:06:42.000
Trish!
Hey.

01:06:42.001 --> 01:06:43.439
- Eli...
- Trish, you can come out now.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:44.559
It's fine.
I'm here.

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:45.759
Just come out, okay?

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:47.079
- I want her away
from the door.

01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.999
- She's away from the door.
Stay there.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.559
- I'm way over here, Trish,
on the other side of the room!

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:52.999
- Mom, calm down, okay?
Grow up.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.321
Come out.
It's fine.

01:06:54.322 --> 01:06:56.160
All right, just relax.

01:06:56.161 --> 01:06:57.880
- Ohh, baby!
- Mommy!

01:06:57.881 --> 01:06:59.599
- Every single time
she comes over...

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.159
- Trish, Trish.
- She makes a scene!

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:02.839
- Every single time.
- Please, don't start.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.159
- Oh, a scene?
Want to see a scene?

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:05.639
Next time you try
to take my daughter,

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.279
I will come here
and burn down your house!

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:09.519
- That is a fine thing to say
in front of two small children.

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.079
You are scaring them!
- You shut up too.

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.279
Sit down!
Sit down!

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.839
Mom, sit down,
and you shut up too!

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:15.519
The both of you!
Stop talking!

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:16.881
Stop talking
and stop talking.

01:07:16.882 --> 01:07:19.440
- In my own home!
- Shut up, okay?

01:07:19.441 --> 01:07:21.639
Jesus Christ, I am
so fucking sick of this shit!

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.799
Okay, Trish, you have to stop
patronizing her, okay?

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:24.919
Get off your high horse

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:26.599
and show your sister
a little compassion.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.639
I am so tired of this, okay?

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:28.961
And I know she is
a pain in the ass.

01:07:28.962 --> 01:07:30.320
- Yes, she is.

01:07:30.321 --> 01:07:32.441
- But you are a pretentious
pain in the ass, all right?

01:07:32.442 --> 01:07:33.560
No.
Stop!

01:07:33.561 --> 01:07:34.719
You have a very nice house,

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:35.999
and you have a very nice car,

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.719
and you have
a very nice television set,

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.481
but Nicole
does not belong here, okay?

01:07:39.482 --> 01:07:40.680
She doesn't.

01:07:40.681 --> 01:07:42.921
She belongs at her home
with her own mother.

01:07:42.922 --> 01:07:45.000
- Fine.
- Good.

01:07:45.001 --> 01:07:47.760
- Thank you, Eli.
- Okay, okay, good.

01:07:47.761 --> 01:07:49.321
And, Nicole,
this sock puppet thing,

01:07:49.322 --> 01:07:50.520
it's gotta stop.

01:07:50.521 --> 01:07:51.841
- Oh, no.
This helps her, sweetie!

01:07:51.842 --> 01:07:52.920
I've told you.

01:07:52.921 --> 01:07:53.999
- No, no, it doesn't help her

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.359
when Julio tells people
to fuck off

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:56.359
and calls them names.

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.359
That's not good.

01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.639
- He is right about that.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.479
- Hey, if I wanted your help,
I would ask for it.

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:01.519
Thank you very much.

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:03.001
Nicole, seriously.
It's gotta stop.

01:08:03.002 --> 01:08:04.080
- Do I, Mommy?

01:08:04.081 --> 01:08:05.320
- Oh, sweetie, no,

01:08:05.321 --> 01:08:08.240
you don't have to
get rid of Mario,

01:08:08.241 --> 01:08:12.120
but what if he was kinder
to people, huh?

01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:14.441
"Oh, Eli, that's
a very nice tie you have on."

01:08:14.442 --> 01:08:17.000
- Okay, Mom.
Mom, stop it, okay?

01:08:17.001 --> 01:08:19.761
Nicole is not coming home
unless you get help.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:21.960
All right?

01:08:21.961 --> 01:08:24.038
And if you don't do that,
then...

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.761
- Honey...
- And if you don't that...

01:08:25.761 --> 01:08:26.880
Please, stop it!

01:08:26.881 --> 01:08:28.441
If you don't get help, then...

01:08:31.361 --> 01:08:36.600
Well, I don't know what's
gonna happen to us, actually.

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:38.041
Yeah, I don't, really.

01:08:46.961 --> 01:08:48.880
- Oh, Stevie.
Hey.

01:08:48.881 --> 01:08:50.600
Sorry about
all the yelling, huh?

01:08:58.041 --> 01:08:59.640
- He's right.

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.240
- I know he's right.

01:09:01.241 --> 01:09:02.961
You are a pretentious ass.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:05.960
- I mean... God.

01:09:05.961 --> 01:09:07.241
- I know.
I am sorry.

01:09:09.361 --> 01:09:12.080
- I mean, you need help.

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:13.281
- I know.

01:09:15.241 --> 01:09:16.401
I know.

01:10:05.601 --> 01:10:08.161
- Eli's gonna need some help
with Nicole, you know?

01:10:08.162 --> 01:10:12.360
Just till I get back, okay?

01:10:12.361 --> 01:10:13.761
- I know.

01:10:18.161 --> 01:10:20.560
- You will?

01:10:20.561 --> 01:10:22.040
- Of course.

01:10:22.041 --> 01:10:23.280
Of course I will.

01:10:23.281 --> 01:10:25.880
- It'll be okay.
It'll be good.

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:30.760
- Okay, okay.

01:10:30.761 --> 01:10:32.160
Who wants a snack?

01:10:32.161 --> 01:10:33.359
Come on, come with me.

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:34.881
- Get something
with Stevie, huh?

01:10:34.882 --> 01:10:37.080
- Let's go get
something yummy.

01:11:41.401 --> 01:11:43.880
That's so beautiful.

01:11:43.881 --> 01:11:45.880
- Thank you.

01:11:45.881 --> 01:11:47.801
- Let's go, baby.

01:12:04.361 --> 01:12:06.161
Here we are again.

01:12:07.921 --> 01:12:10.161
All the decaf I can drink.

01:12:22.761 --> 01:12:24.521
- All right.

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:30.280
You ready?

01:12:30.281 --> 01:12:31.601
- Yeah.

01:12:36.161 --> 01:12:37.279
You know, after today,

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.761
I don't even feel
like getting high.

01:12:38.762 --> 01:12:41.760
Funny, huh?

01:12:41.761 --> 01:12:44.441
- No.

01:12:45.521 --> 01:12:48.680
- You're right.
- Okay.

01:12:48.681 --> 01:12:50.640
- Time to get clean.

01:12:57.961 --> 01:13:00.441
Sweetie, would you keep
a look out of the back?

01:13:05.601 --> 01:13:06.841
- Yeah, you're good.

01:13:23.121 --> 01:13:27.640
You know, Eli, um...

01:13:27.641 --> 01:13:30.920
I'm really sorry.

01:13:30.921 --> 01:13:32.561
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take care of this,

01:13:32.562 --> 01:13:35.440
and then I'm gonna
take care of you,

01:13:35.441 --> 01:13:38.281
and I'm gonna take care
of Coley, I promise.

01:13:38.282 --> 01:13:40.000
- Thank you.

01:13:40.001 --> 01:13:41.160
It's okay.

01:13:41.161 --> 01:13:42.239
- I promise you.

01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:44.519
- Please...
please don't promise me.

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:45.801
We're gonna be okay.

01:13:45.802 --> 01:13:47.720
It's gonna be fine.

01:13:47.721 --> 01:13:52.080
- Honey, I know I've taken you
through a lot of shit.

01:13:52.081 --> 01:13:55.200
I don't want that
to get in your way.

01:13:55.201 --> 01:13:57.480
I don't want it to stop you.

01:13:57.481 --> 01:13:59.840
I'm so proud of you, huh?

01:13:59.841 --> 01:14:02.680
Oh, you played
beautifully today.

01:14:02.681 --> 01:14:04.160
- Thank you.

01:14:04.161 --> 01:14:06.201
- I want you to go
to that school, huh?

01:14:06.202 --> 01:14:10.121
Huh?
- Yeah, I know.

01:14:11.721 --> 01:14:17.160
- Just don't forget me
when you're rich and famous.

01:14:17.161 --> 01:14:20.880
- I think it would be
painfully hard to forget you.

01:14:20.881 --> 01:14:22.801
Yeah.

01:14:26.721 --> 01:14:32.200
And I know you don't think
you have a problem...

01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:35.480
but you
could end up here too, hmm?

01:14:35.481 --> 01:14:39.360
Eli, it's in your genes.

01:14:39.361 --> 01:14:41.281
- Thanks for that, Mom.

01:14:44.121 --> 01:14:46.200
Okay.

01:14:46.201 --> 01:14:47.360
- Yeah.

01:14:47.361 --> 01:14:48.561
- All right.
Let's get going.

01:14:48.562 --> 01:14:50.041
- No.
- What?

01:14:52.681 --> 01:14:55.000
- I want to go in
on my own, hmm?

01:14:55.001 --> 01:14:56.600
I want to do this.

01:14:56.601 --> 01:14:59.400
- Okay.

01:14:59.401 --> 01:15:03.160
That's good.
That's good.

01:15:03.161 --> 01:15:05.440
- I like that tie.

01:15:05.441 --> 01:15:07.960
Looks good on you.

01:15:07.961 --> 01:15:09.121
- Thanks.

01:15:13.121 --> 01:15:14.240
- Hoo.

01:15:18.001 --> 01:15:19.360
All righty.

01:15:19.361 --> 01:15:21.281
- All right.

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:54.881
- Oh, fuck!

01:16:45.161 --> 01:16:46.521
- Pass that bread.

01:16:48.601 --> 01:16:50.361
- Why you eating
so much bread, Black?

01:16:50.362 --> 01:16:52.600
You need to cut it out.

01:16:52.601 --> 01:16:53.800
- I like bread.

01:16:55.161 --> 01:16:57.881
Here you are lecturing
somebody about what to eat.

01:16:57.882 --> 01:17:00.040
- He do eat too much bread, Ma!

01:17:00.041 --> 01:17:01.639
- Man, it's just a damn roll.

01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:03.239
- You gonna catch
a yeast infection

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:04.881
eating all that bread, man.

01:17:06.881 --> 01:17:09.200
- How's Mario doing?

01:17:09.201 --> 01:17:11.721

I really like this war thing.

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:46.001

specifically,

01:18:46.002 --> 01:18:48.360
but, um, I think I really...

01:18:48.361 --> 01:18:50.641
I think I really
like this world.

01:18:50.642 --> 01:18:51.960

- Yeah.

01:18:53.322 --> 01:18:54.680
Sorry, hold on.

01:18:54.681 --> 01:18:56.280
- No, sure, yeah.

01:18:56.281 --> 01:18:57.960
- Sorry.
Hello?

01:18:57.961 --> 01:18:59.801
<i>- Eli,
you didn't come back.</i>

01:18:59.802 --> 01:19:01.000
- Wait, what...

01:19:01.001 --> 01:19:02.199
<i>- They still want to see you.</i>

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.639
- Whoa, whoa, wait, wait,
the judges?

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:04.839
<i>- They think you're great.</i>

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.159
<i>Eccentric, but talented.</i>

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.839
- Wait, eccen...
did they say eccentric?

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:10.079
<i>- No, they said crazy.
I'm saying eccentric.</i>

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.319
<i>Eli, this is serious.</i>

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.239
<i>They want to give you a chance.</i>

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:15.159
- Okay, no, no, that is...
that is great news.

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:16.959
<i>- I can tell them
you'll come back tomorrow.</i>

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:18.321
- Yeah, no, it is.
Thank you, Dave.

01:19:18.322 --> 01:19:19.881
<i>- Eli?</i>

01:19:23.001 --> 01:19:24.400
- They want me back.

01:19:24.401 --> 01:19:25.880
- Great.

01:19:25.881 --> 01:19:27.640
- I thought I ruined it.

01:19:27.641 --> 01:19:29.360
- No.
Congratulations.

01:19:31.201 --> 01:19:32.481
- Yeah.

01:19:34.241 --> 01:19:35.479
- I'm proud of you.

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:37.161
You know, you can be proud
of yourself.

01:19:37.162 --> 01:19:38.480
- Okay.

01:19:38.481 --> 01:19:39.640
I am.

01:19:39.641 --> 01:19:40.800
No, I am.
I am.

01:19:40.801 --> 01:19:44.080
I think, uh...

01:19:44.081 --> 01:19:45.560
Okay, yeah.
- Okay.

01:19:45.561 --> 01:19:47.361
- I think I am.

01:19:50.281 --> 01:19:52.681
- Do you want to, uh, be
one of us?

01:19:52.682 --> 01:19:54.640
Do you want to put on a hat?

01:19:54.641 --> 01:19:55.880
- Yeah.
Thanks.

01:19:57.001 --> 01:19:58.079
I mean, that's a step.

01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:59.519
- That's all it takes, right?

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:02.079
- Well, that and courage
and integrity.

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:04.081
- Okay, I'll find those
afterwards.

01:20:04.082 --> 01:20:05.720
- You look great.

01:20:05.721 --> 01:20:06.881
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:06.882 --> 01:20:08.560
- Like a pirate?

01:20:08.561 --> 01:20:09.880
- Um...

01:20:09.881 --> 01:20:11.121
- Like a revolutionary pirate?

01:20:11.122 --> 01:20:12.320
- Yes.

01:20:12.321 --> 01:20:14.161
You want to mix that.
You need a name, though.

01:20:14.162 --> 01:20:18.120
I'll name you, uh, Elliot Bloom,
son of John Bloom.

01:20:18.121 --> 01:20:20.961
He's a great guy,
and he's the village artisan.

01:20:20.962 --> 01:20:23.720
