17:03.316 --> 17:07.233
That's almost...3 days.

17:07.266 --> 17:08.483
"Almost?"

17:09.016 --> 17:11.200
Well, what are we
supposed to do
till then?

17:11.233 --> 17:15.300
We wait right here,
very quietly.

17:15.333 --> 17:18.000
Preferably seated.

17:18.033 --> 17:20.466
That's it,
nice and easy.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.116
Mom: Kids! Come on down!
Lunch is ready!

17:25.150 --> 17:26.350
Lunch!

17:26.383 --> 17:28.233
Dee Dee, wait!

17:28.266 --> 17:31.066
Dexter: Ow! Ow! Ow!

17:31.100 --> 17:32.150
Dee Dee, wait!

17:32.183 --> 17:33.183
Oof!

17:33.216 --> 17:34.150
If mom and dad

17:34.183 --> 17:35.283
see us like this,

17:35.316 --> 17:39.183
I can kiss
my secret lab good-bye.

17:41.433 --> 17:44.200
[Humming]

17:53.216 --> 17:54.300
Where's Dexter?

17:54.333 --> 17:56.483
Dexter!
Come and get--

17:57.016 --> 18:00.083
greetings,
mom and dad.

18:00.116 --> 18:01.383
Dee Dee.

18:02.350 --> 18:04.266
Man, that was close.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.150
And we still have
12 hours to go.

18:06.183 --> 18:09.433
I think we better
just hide out here
in the lab.

18:09.466 --> 18:13.016
My dance auditions
are today!

18:13.050 --> 18:14.333
No, Dee Dee!

18:17.283 --> 18:20.466
Thanks a lot!
You ruined my audition.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.100
Oh, come on,
it wasn't that bad.

18:23.133 --> 18:24.016
Ouch!

18:24.050 --> 18:25.116
Stupid science!

18:25.150 --> 18:27.033
I said I was sorry!
Ouch!

18:27.066 --> 18:28.283
I have a mind
to tell dad

18:28.316 --> 18:31.133
about your stupid
secret laboratory.

18:31.166 --> 18:33.433
Dad: Is that you, kids?

18:34.350 --> 18:36.233
You wouldn't!
Please, Dee Dee!

18:36.266 --> 18:38.133
Not the secret lab!

18:38.166 --> 18:40.016
Hi, dad.

18:40.050 --> 18:41.166
Hi, Dee Dee.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.250
And Dexter.

18:42.283 --> 18:43.283
Hi, dad.

18:43.316 --> 18:46.466
We have something
to tell you.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.016
Dexter has a secret--

18:48.050 --> 18:50.316
wait, wait,
let me go first.

18:50.350 --> 18:53.050
Your dance teacher
just called,

18:53.083 --> 18:55.316
and congratulations!
You made the cut!

18:55.350 --> 18:58.000
I did?

18:58.033 --> 18:59.166
She did?

18:59.200 --> 19:00.250
You did!

19:00.283 --> 19:05.000
They said
they never saw
anything like it.

19:05.033 --> 19:08.266
Now, what's
your little secret,
Dexter?

19:08.300 --> 19:10.333
My secret? I, um...

19:10.366 --> 19:14.166
Dexter wants to try out
for the dance, too.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.033
Really!

19:15.066 --> 19:16.383
Let's see what you got!

19:16.416 --> 19:18.216
I, um, I...

19:18.250 --> 19:21.283
Go on, Dex!
Don't be shy!

19:31.350 --> 19:33.350
Dee Dee: Ta-da!

19:33.383 --> 19:34.383
Well, son,

19:34.416 --> 19:38.166
I've never seen
anything like it.

19:41.133 --> 19:43.450
We still have
10 hours to go.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.450
I'm bushed.

19:45.483 --> 19:48.250
[Snoring]

19:50.166 --> 19:51.416
Dee Dee!

19:51.450 --> 19:53.300
Dee Dee!

19:53.333 --> 19:58.016
I am running out
of air down here!

19:58.050 --> 19:59.333
Dee Dee!

20:00.416 --> 20:03.333
All right,
back off, buddy.

20:03.366 --> 20:06.100
You're on the wrong side
of the bed.

20:06.133 --> 20:09.316
Don't make me
have to stub that toe.

20:09.350 --> 20:10.450
Oh, no, you don't!

20:10.483 --> 20:13.400
Now you're going
to get it!

20:15.233 --> 20:19.100
Fine! You can keep
your stinky bed.

20:20.200 --> 20:23.266
If I can just find
the edge of the bed.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.066
Free at last!

20:28.100 --> 20:32.200
Unh! Unh!

20:33.433 --> 20:36.216
[Sobbing]

20:38.100 --> 20:40.016
Ok, here's
how it works.

20:40.050 --> 20:42.033
We get in this
pod here.

20:42.066 --> 20:43.083
Ooh.

20:43.116 --> 20:46.166
I have set
the teleporter
to separate...

20:46.200 --> 20:47.200
Ooh.

20:47.233 --> 20:51.450
Your stupid atoms
from my smart atoms.

20:51.483 --> 20:56.050
And we should end up
over there, good as new.

20:56.083 --> 20:58.050
Computer, on my Mark.

20:58.083 --> 20:59.433
4, 3, two, one, go!

21:14.116 --> 21:16.050
Both: Success!!

21:16.083 --> 21:18.250
Now, get out
of my lab!

21:18.283 --> 21:19.200
Both: Fine!

21:19.233 --> 21:22.216
I'm sick
of this place anyway.

21:22.250 --> 21:23.400
That is nice,
good-bye,

21:23.433 --> 21:25.466
have a nice day
now.
