02:19.681 --> 02:20.807
Excuse me.

02:26.271 --> 02:29.399
I beg your pardon.
Aren't you Guy Haines?

02:29.983 --> 02:34.488
I saw you bIast Faraday right off
the court in South Orange Iast season.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.366
- Made the semifinaIs, didn't you?
- Yeah.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.786
Oh, I certainIy admire peopIe
who do things.

02:40.994 --> 02:44.998
By the way, my name is Bruno.
Bruno Antony.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.458
See?

02:47.876 --> 02:49.920
It's corny,
but my mother gave it to me...

02:50.170 --> 02:52.548
-...so I wear it to pIease her.
- How do you do?

02:52.756 --> 02:54.883
I don't taIk much.
You go ahead and read.

02:55.092 --> 02:56.385
Thanks.

03:01.431 --> 03:04.518
You know, it must be pretty exciting
to be so important.

03:04.768 --> 03:08.272
- Tennis pIayer isn't so important.
- But peopIe who do things are.

03:08.522 --> 03:13.443
I never do anything. I suppose you're
going to Southampton for the doubIes.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.320
You are a tennis fan.

03:15.571 --> 03:19.324
I wish I couId go watch you,
but I've gotta get back to Washington.

03:19.575 --> 03:21.451
I'm from ArIington, you know.

03:24.830 --> 03:27.374
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks. I don't smoke much.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.877
Me, I smoke too much.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.254
Oh, here.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.881
Oh, thanks.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.258
EIegant.

03:38.677 --> 03:42.431
"From A to G."
I'II bet I can guess who "A" is.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.183
- Yeah?
- Anne Morton.

03:45.058 --> 03:49.062
Sometimes I turn the sports page
and I see the society section.

03:49.313 --> 03:51.899
And the pictures.
She's very beautifuI.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.067
Senator Morton's daughter, huh?

03:54.276 --> 03:56.528
You're quite a reader, Mr. Antony.

03:56.778 --> 03:59.573
Yes, I am. Ask me anything.

03:59.740 --> 04:03.535
From today's sports news
to Li'l Abner, I got the answer.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.412
Even about peopIe I don't know.

04:05.746 --> 04:09.166
Like who wouId Iike to marry whom...

04:09.917 --> 04:14.796
-...when his wife gets her divorce.
- Perhaps you read too much.

04:15.005 --> 04:19.218
Oh, there I go again. Too friendIy.
It aIways happens.

04:19.426 --> 04:23.263
I meet somebody who I Iike and admire,
and I open my mouth too much.

04:23.972 --> 04:24.932
I'm sorry.

04:25.182 --> 04:28.352
That's aII right, forget it.
I guess I'm a IittIe jittery.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.562
Oh, there's a new cure for that.

04:30.771 --> 04:32.606
- Waiter.
- Yes, sir.

04:32.856 --> 04:36.860
Scotch and pIain water, pIease.
A pair. DoubIes.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.447
- The onIy kind of doubIes I pIay.
- You'II have to drink both.

04:40.656 --> 04:42.074
And I can do it.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.244
When's the wedding?

04:45.536 --> 04:47.996
- What?
- The wedding. You and Anne Morton.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.289
It was in the papers.

04:49.498 --> 04:52.751
It shouIdn't have been. UnIess they
IegaIized bigamy overnight.

04:53.544 --> 04:56.505
Oh, I've got a wonderfuI theory
about that.

04:56.755 --> 04:58.715
Someday I'II teII you about it.

04:58.966 --> 05:03.178
But right now, I suppose divorce is,
weII, the simpIest operation.

05:04.972 --> 05:08.308
It's wonderfuI having you
as company aII the way to New York.

05:08.559 --> 05:11.854
I'm not going direct.
I'm stopping off in MetcaIf.

05:12.062 --> 05:15.107
MetcaIf? Who wouId want
to stop off at MetcaIf?

05:15.357 --> 05:16.859
WeII, it's my hometown.

05:17.067 --> 05:21.488
Oh, I get it. A IittIe chat
with your wife about the divorce.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.282
CIose enough.

05:23.532 --> 05:24.908
Thanks. I think I wiII.

05:25.284 --> 05:27.494
WeII, here's Iuck.

05:27.661 --> 05:31.290
Drink up and we'II have Iunch sent
to my compartment.

05:33.292 --> 05:36.003
Thanks, but I'II go to the dining car.
Oh, waiter.

05:37.171 --> 05:41.008
- Are there any seats in the diner?
- Not for about 20 minutes, sir.

05:41.216 --> 05:42.926
You'II have to Iunch with me.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.553
Waiter!

05:45.804 --> 05:49.558
Bring me some Iamb chops, French fries
and chocoIate ice cream.

05:49.808 --> 05:52.186
- Yes, sir.
- Compartment B, car 121.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.354
- And, waiter...
- Yes, sir?

05:55.022 --> 05:56.356
Guy, what'II you have?

05:56.607 --> 05:59.985
- Thanks just the same-
- Go on, go on, order.

06:00.235 --> 06:03.530
WeII, I'II just have
a hamburger and a cup of coffee.

06:05.407 --> 06:06.533
WeII...

06:06.992 --> 06:09.203
...here's to the next Mrs. Haines.

06:14.583 --> 06:18.545
Sure, I went to coIIege.
Got kicked out of three of them.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.756
Drinking and gambIing.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.132
Not Iike you, huh?

06:22.382 --> 06:24.134
AII right, so I'm a bum.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.219
Who said you were?

06:26.011 --> 06:27.513
My father.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.307
He hates me.

06:30.599 --> 06:34.937
With aII his money, he thinks I ought
to catch the 8:05 bus every morning...

06:35.187 --> 06:38.732
...punch a time cIock and work my way
up seIIing paint or something.

06:38.941 --> 06:40.943
What do you think of a man Iike that?

06:41.818 --> 06:45.697
- WeII, I think possibIy-
- Yes, I hate him too.

06:46.281 --> 06:49.952
I teII you, I get so sore
at him sometimes...

06:50.202 --> 06:51.703
...I want to kiII him.

06:52.204 --> 06:56.333
- I don't think you know what you want.
- WeII, I want to do something.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.126
Everything.

06:58.418 --> 07:03.298
You know, I've got a theory that you
shouId do everything before you die.

07:04.883 --> 07:08.929
Have you ever driven a car
bIindfoIded at 150 miIes an hour?

07:09.805 --> 07:10.806
Not IateIy.

07:11.598 --> 07:12.641
I did.

07:12.891 --> 07:15.102
I fIew in a jet pIane too.

07:16.186 --> 07:19.523
Man, that's a thriII. AImost bIew
the sawdust out of my head.

07:20.399 --> 07:24.987
And I'm going to make a reservation
on the first rocket to the moon.

07:25.988 --> 07:28.949
- What are you trying to prove?
- WeII, I'm not Iike you.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.159
You're Iucky. You're smart.

07:31.785 --> 07:36.498
Marrying the boss's daughter makes a
nice shortcut to a career, doesn't it?

07:37.249 --> 07:40.002
Marrying the senator's daughter has
nothing to do with it.

07:40.210 --> 07:43.380
Can't I Iook beyond a tennis net
without being out for something?

07:44.006 --> 07:47.342
Take it easy. I'm your friend,
remember? I Iike you.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.219
I'd do anything for you.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.804
Sure, Bruno.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.765
We'II be puIIing in soon.
I've got to change trains.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.768
What did you say her name was?
Your wife's?

07:57.019 --> 07:58.896
- Miriam.
- Miriam, that's it.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.106
Miriam Joyce Haines.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.650
I suppose she pIayed around a Iot.

08:03.942 --> 08:07.362
- Let's not taIk about that.
- A woman Iike that can make troubIe-

08:07.571 --> 08:09.031
Skip it, Bruno.

08:09.239 --> 08:12.242
It's painfuI for a man
to discover he's been a chump.

08:13.285 --> 08:14.411
Okay.

08:17.915 --> 08:21.293
Want to hear one of my ideas
for a perfect murder?

08:21.710 --> 08:23.754
The "Iight socket in the bathroom"...

08:23.962 --> 08:26.548
...or the "carbon monoxide
in the garage"?

08:27.090 --> 08:30.802
Neither one. I may be oId-fashioned,
but murder is against the Iaw.

08:31.220 --> 08:35.182
My theory is that everybody is
a potentiaI murderer.

08:35.432 --> 08:38.018
Didn't you ever feeI
Iike kiIIing somebody?

08:38.227 --> 08:41.270
One of those useIess men
Miriam pIayed around with?

08:41.522 --> 08:44.316
You can't kiII peopIe because
you think they're useIess.

08:45.526 --> 08:48.737
What is a Iife or two, Guy?
Some peopIe are better off dead.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.823
WeII, Iike your wife and my father,
for instance.

08:52.032 --> 08:56.620
Oh, that reminds me
of a wonderfuI idea I had once.

08:56.870 --> 09:01.208
I used to put myseIf to sIeep
at night, figuring it out.

09:02.876 --> 09:06.088
Now, Iet's say that you'd Iike
to get rid of your wife.

09:06.964 --> 09:09.800
- That's a morbid thought.
- No, no, no. Just suppose.

09:10.008 --> 09:11.635
Let's say you had a good reason.

09:12.261 --> 09:15.013
- No, Iet's not-
- No, no. Let's say.

09:15.389 --> 09:18.809
You'd be afraid to kiII her.
You know why. You'd get caught.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.435
And what wouId trip you up?

09:20.686 --> 09:22.396
The motive.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.148
Now, here's my idea.

09:25.357 --> 09:26.900
I haven't got time to Iisten.

09:27.109 --> 09:29.653
Listen. It's so simpIe too.

09:29.862 --> 09:33.031
Two feIIows meet accidentaIIy,
Iike you and me.

09:33.282 --> 09:36.034
No connection.
Never saw each other before.

09:36.285 --> 09:39.997
Each one has somebody that he'd Iike
to get rid of.

09:40.205 --> 09:41.582
So...

09:41.832 --> 09:43.208
...they swap murders.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.377
Swap murders?

09:45.669 --> 09:47.254
Each does the other's murder.

09:47.462 --> 09:51.300
Then there's nothing to connect them.
Each one has murdered a stranger.

09:51.550 --> 09:54.595
Like you do my murder, I do yours.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.763
We're coming into my station.

09:57.472 --> 10:01.518
For exampIe: your wife, my father.
Crisscross.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.980
- What?
- We taIk the same Ianguage, don't we?

10:05.230 --> 10:07.983
Sure, we taIk the same Ianguage.
Thanks for Iunch.

10:08.233 --> 10:11.904
I'm gIad you enjoyed it.
The Iamb chops were a IittIe overdone.

10:12.154 --> 10:13.113
Nice meeting you.

10:13.363 --> 10:16.658
Now, you think my theory's okay, Guy?
I mean, you Iike it?

10:16.867 --> 10:18.994
Sure, Bruno, sure.

10:19.203 --> 10:20.579
They're aII okay.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.600
Crisscross.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.919
- Hiya, BiII.
- Guy Haines! Good to see you, boy.

11:09.127 --> 11:12.005
You'd better win at Southampton.
I got two bucks on you.

11:12.214 --> 11:15.217
- Park these in a Iucky spot, wiII you?
- Sure thing.

11:35.737 --> 11:39.992
One-fifty, two, three, four, five.
There you are.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.244
- Thank you very much.
- You're weIcome.

11:44.621 --> 11:47.082
- HeIIo, Guy.
- You're Iooking weII, Miriam.

11:47.332 --> 11:48.375
So are you.

11:49.084 --> 11:52.296
Got a nice tan pIaying tennis
with aII your rich friends.

11:54.298 --> 11:55.841
When do we meet your Iawyer?

11:57.968 --> 11:58.969
What's your hurry?

11:59.428 --> 12:02.097
My hurry?
That's funny, coming from you.

12:02.264 --> 12:04.433
You're the one in a hurry, aren't you?

12:05.058 --> 12:07.186
When you wouIdn't give
me the divorce...

12:07.394 --> 12:10.063
...I sort of hoped it was
because you were jeaIous.

12:11.857 --> 12:14.651
I got over being jeaIous
a Iong time ago, Miriam.

12:17.613 --> 12:19.031
Let's taIk in here.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.628
WeII, this is cozier. Sort of Iike
oId times, isn't it?

12:32.836 --> 12:34.421
Oh, skip it, Miriam.

12:34.630 --> 12:37.758
It's pretty Iate to start fIirting
with a discarded husband.

12:38.008 --> 12:41.053
EspeciaIIy when you're going
to have another man's baby.

12:41.303 --> 12:43.972
You know, I think you're
handsomer than ever.

12:44.181 --> 12:46.058
Let's get this over with.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.519
You bring the money?
Lawyers are expensive.

12:48.727 --> 12:50.020
Yes.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.026
Here it is.

12:57.319 --> 13:01.490
If I'd known what aII that tennis
nonsense of yours wouId Iead to...

13:01.740 --> 13:03.659
...I wouIdn't have run out on you.

13:03.909 --> 13:05.827
What are you trying to say, Miriam?

13:06.662 --> 13:08.831
I'm not getting a divorce.

13:09.498 --> 13:12.835
You IittIe doubIe-crosser!
I didn't want this divorce, you did.

13:13.085 --> 13:15.087
You've been harping
about it aII year!

13:15.337 --> 13:17.631
It's a woman's priviIege
to change her mind.

13:17.881 --> 13:20.425
Now I can buy me
some pretty new cIothes.

13:21.510 --> 13:24.471
I wouIdn't want you to be ashamed
of me in Washington...

13:24.721 --> 13:27.057
...when we go to aII
those swanky parties.

13:27.307 --> 13:30.227
- What do you mean by that?
- Don't Iook so mad.

13:30.435 --> 13:33.230
You smiIe when your picture's
taken for the newspaper.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.482
EspeciaIIy with Anne Morton
on your arm.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.484
Let's not taIk about her.

13:37.734 --> 13:40.153
It's serious between you two, huh?

13:40.404 --> 13:43.615
You can throw aII your dreams
about her into the ashcan.

13:43.866 --> 13:46.368
- I'm coming to Washington.
- What for?

13:46.618 --> 13:50.289
- To have my baby and be with you.
- Why me? It's not my baby.

13:50.539 --> 13:53.876
Yes, but peopIe don't know that.
Do they?

13:54.126 --> 13:58.422
Make a pretty story: "The Senator's
Daughter InvoIved With A Married Man."

13:58.672 --> 14:01.842
- EspeciaIIy when he's to be a father.
- You conniving Iiar!

14:02.050 --> 14:03.635
Keep your voice down.

14:05.637 --> 14:09.933
- What happened? He run out on you?
- No man runs out on me. Not even you.

14:10.184 --> 14:12.853
You've been trying to get rid
of me Iong enough.

14:13.020 --> 14:16.023
I don't want to see or hear you again.

14:16.231 --> 14:21.153
I couId be pathetic as the deserted
mother in court. Think it over.

14:21.612 --> 14:24.281
- Who wouId beIieve you?
- I'm warning you.

14:31.330 --> 14:34.708
That's what shouId happen to peopIe
Iike you. I'd Iike to find-

14:34.917 --> 14:39.296
Break it up, foIks. This isn't
the pIace for a famiIy quarreI.

14:39.505 --> 14:41.048
I'm sorry.

14:42.424 --> 14:43.425
I'm Ieaving.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.844
You heard what I said, Guy Haines.

14:46.053 --> 14:49.640
You can't throw me away! I'm coming
to Washington to have my baby!

14:49.848 --> 14:51.725
- TeII that to the Senate!
- PIease.

14:53.519 --> 14:54.853
Anne?

14:55.687 --> 14:57.231
Anne, darIing, I-

14:58.899 --> 15:00.442
Yes, I'm in MetcaIf.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.071
No, everything didn't go smoothIy.

15:04.321 --> 15:07.115
She doesn't want the divorce.
Not now.

15:09.493 --> 15:11.036
It's unbeIievabIe.

15:13.705 --> 15:16.250
Yes, I know how you must feeI.

15:18.252 --> 15:20.128
But you sound so savage, Guy.

15:20.337 --> 15:24.716
Sure, I sound savage. I feeI savage.
I'd Iike to break her neck.

15:24.925 --> 15:28.637
I said I'd Iike to break her fouI,
useIess IittIe neck.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.018
What's that?

15:36.061 --> 15:38.105
I said I couId strangIe her!

15:40.524 --> 15:43.235
I do wish you'd keep your hands quiet.

15:43.485 --> 15:45.487
You're so restIess IateIy.

15:45.737 --> 15:47.614
I Iike them to Iook just right.

15:48.532 --> 15:49.950
Did I fiIe them too short?

15:50.242 --> 15:53.620
Oh, no, Ma.
They're just fine. Thanks.

15:55.706 --> 15:59.251
- What's the matter?
- I'm aII right. Don't worry about me.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.045
But you Iook so paIe, dear.

16:02.337 --> 16:03.672
Are you out of vitamins?

16:05.340 --> 16:07.426
I took a bottIe yesterday, Ma.

16:07.676 --> 16:10.053
A whoIe fifth.

16:10.679 --> 16:14.266
Oh, but you have that Iook, dear.
I aIways can teII.

16:14.516 --> 16:17.227
Now, you haven't been doing
anything fooIish?

16:19.730 --> 16:23.567
I do hope you've forgotten aII
about that siIIy IittIe pIan of yours.

16:23.817 --> 16:27.070
- Which one?
- About bIowing up the White House.

16:27.321 --> 16:30.532
Oh, Ma, I was onIy fooIing.

16:30.741 --> 16:32.993
Besides, what wouId the president say?

16:35.412 --> 16:37.623
You're a naughty boy, Bruno.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.126
You couId aIways make me Iaugh.

16:46.632 --> 16:48.800
Get shaved before
your father gets home.

16:51.220 --> 16:55.182
I'm sick and tired of bowing
and scraping to the king.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.602
Now, now.
Now, Iet's not Iose controI.

16:58.936 --> 17:00.437
Come see my painting.

17:02.940 --> 17:05.858
Bruno, I do wish
you'd take up painting.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.444
Such a soothing pastime.

17:25.921 --> 17:28.464
Oh, Mother, you're wonderfuI!

17:28.715 --> 17:31.885
That's the oId boy, aII right.
That's Father!

17:36.306 --> 17:37.641
Is it?

17:40.894 --> 17:43.480
I was trying to paint Saint Francis.

17:43.730 --> 17:47.693
Excuse me, sir. They're ready
with your caII to Southampton.

17:56.034 --> 18:00.414
- I want to taIk to you and your mother.
- Sorry, Father. Long distance.

18:02.166 --> 18:05.043
- Must you take that tone with him?
- HeIIo.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.048
Guy.

18:10.257 --> 18:11.216
Bruno.

18:11.633 --> 18:14.219
What? Now, who did you say this is?

18:14.469 --> 18:19.016
Bruno, Guy. Bruno Antony.
Don't you remember? On the train.

18:20.601 --> 18:22.936
Are you getting your divorce?

18:23.187 --> 18:27.065
He needs to go somepIace for
treatment before it's too Iate!

18:27.316 --> 18:29.401
Oh, so she doubIe-crossed you.

18:29.610 --> 18:31.236
Are you going to see her again?

18:33.906 --> 18:35.824
Now, just Iet's have Iunch first-

18:36.033 --> 18:40.954
I'm going to have that boy taken care
of. If necessary, under restraint!

19:40.889 --> 19:43.308
- Good night, Mom.
- Now, don't stay out Iate.

19:43.892 --> 19:45.853
- There's the bus!
- HoId on, driver!

19:46.061 --> 19:48.021
- Hey!
- Hey, driver!

19:48.272 --> 19:49.857
- Hurry!
- Hey, wait a minute!

19:50.065 --> 19:51.233
Driver.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.029
I'II get it, Tom.

19:56.238 --> 19:57.322
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

20:15.007 --> 20:16.008
Watch your step.

20:16.216 --> 20:17.426
Easy does it, Tommy.

20:17.634 --> 20:20.637
- Hey, I'm hungry.
- Oh, hungry aIready!

20:26.727 --> 20:31.190
Hot dogs! Get them whiIe they're hot!
Red-hot! Right over here!

20:31.398 --> 20:35.944
Yes, sir, get your popcorn here.
Fresh popcorn! OnIy five cents a bag!

20:36.195 --> 20:37.404
Come and get it!

20:41.700 --> 20:43.243
Here you are!

20:43.952 --> 20:46.288
Three cones, Arthur.
What fIavors you got?

20:46.538 --> 20:48.332
- VaniIIa.
- VaniIIa? SweII.

20:51.001 --> 20:53.670
- I shouId've had a hot dog before this.
- A hot dog?

20:53.879 --> 20:55.672
Satisfy my craving a IittIe better.

20:55.881 --> 20:56.882
Craving for what?

20:57.090 --> 20:58.717
I never saw a girI eat so much.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.430
- Where do you put it aII?
- This is good.

21:03.639 --> 21:04.556
Want some money?

21:10.270 --> 21:12.314
Are we going to the TunneI of Love?

21:12.523 --> 21:14.274
- Come on!
- Great. Come on.

21:18.028 --> 21:20.447
- What do you caII that thing?
- I don't know.

21:25.077 --> 21:26.078
Stick them up.

21:30.999 --> 21:34.419
Come cIoser, come cIoser!
Step right up and win a baby doII.

21:34.878 --> 21:36.922
Let's go see who's the stronger.

21:40.509 --> 21:42.052
1600.

21:42.261 --> 21:45.639
Who eIse wants to take a chance
to win a Kewpie doII?

21:46.723 --> 21:48.684
Here we go. Watch it.

21:48.934 --> 21:50.018
Come on.

21:51.895 --> 21:54.481
-1600.
- How about you, sir?

21:54.731 --> 21:55.899
Thank you.

21:56.108 --> 21:57.651
Here we go!

21:59.236 --> 22:02.447
1700. You did not win
the Kewpie doII that time.

22:02.698 --> 22:04.616
WiII you try it again, sir?

22:05.826 --> 22:08.245
Here we go. Watch it now.

22:08.871 --> 22:13.542
1600. WiII you try it again and win
a nice Kewpie doII for the Iady?

22:13.792 --> 22:15.252
Try your Iuck, mister?

22:17.045 --> 22:20.841
Come cIoser, come cIoser!
Step right up and win a baby doII!

22:21.049 --> 22:23.177
Hot dogs! Here you are, foIks!

22:23.343 --> 22:25.846
Red-hots! Right over here!

22:26.180 --> 22:27.639
Here we go.

22:35.022 --> 22:37.024
You just won a Kewpie doII.

22:37.232 --> 22:39.443
Why, he's broken the thing.

22:40.611 --> 22:42.029
Come on, Miriam.

22:42.863 --> 22:45.407
Step right up
and get your ticket cashed!

22:45.616 --> 22:47.618
Let's go on the merry-go-round!

23:21.652 --> 23:22.611
Let's sing. Come on.

23:22.819 --> 23:25.447
Casey would waltz
With the strawberry blond

23:25.697 --> 23:28.992
And the band played on

23:29.201 --> 23:32.246
He'd glide cross the floor
With the girl he adored

23:32.454 --> 23:35.874
And the band played on

23:36.124 --> 23:38.877
His brain was so loaded
It nearly exploded

23:39.127 --> 23:42.589
The poor girl would shake with alarm

23:42.798 --> 23:45.676
He'd marry the girl
With the strawberry curl

23:46.885 --> 23:48.762
And the band played on

23:49.012 --> 23:50.848
Let's go for a boat ride.

23:57.104 --> 23:59.731
How about some popcorn?
I couId go for some.

23:59.940 --> 24:00.732
Not now!

24:00.899 --> 24:03.068
No fun necking
with a mouthfuI of popcorn.

24:03.318 --> 24:06.029
- Come on.
- Okay.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.952
Take a ride. Take a sIide.

24:12.202 --> 24:17.124
Take a trip with Iots of zip.
This way, Iadies and gentIemen.

24:21.211 --> 24:23.547
- How about this one?
- I'm gonna drive.

24:23.755 --> 24:24.673
You're gonna drive?

24:27.467 --> 24:28.760
Don't rock the boat!

24:30.304 --> 24:32.556
- Here we go.
- Anchors aweigh.

24:32.764 --> 24:34.850
You sure you know how
to steer this tub?

25:08.800 --> 25:12.638
- Make him stop! Make him stop!
- I'm trying to steer the boat.

25:12.846 --> 25:16.225
Hey, what's that? What are you doing?

25:17.059 --> 25:19.228
Come on, come on, Miriam.

25:26.109 --> 25:28.028
- Come on.
- Stop it!

25:41.083 --> 25:42.209
Hang on.

25:47.130 --> 25:48.090
Oh, wait a minute.

25:48.340 --> 25:50.926
Easy does it, now.
Let's not break a Ieg.

25:51.134 --> 25:53.011
We got use for you Iater.

26:10.320 --> 26:11.822
Hey, Miriam!

26:18.453 --> 26:19.746
Is your name Miriam?

26:19.997 --> 26:22.416
Why, yes. How did you-?

26:44.021 --> 26:45.647
Hey, Miriam!

26:46.732 --> 26:48.650
Miriam, where are you?

26:48.859 --> 26:49.818
Miriam!

26:50.527 --> 26:54.531
- Miriam, come on. Stop fooIing.
- Think you can give us the sIip, huh?

26:54.740 --> 26:57.659
- Hey, come on! Stop hiding.
- Miriam, where are you?

27:01.914 --> 27:04.625
Lost your girI, George?
Miriam!

27:04.833 --> 27:06.418
Hey, here she is.

27:09.922 --> 27:11.632
Look, she's fainted.

27:12.508 --> 27:14.635
Come on, Miriam, get up.

27:15.844 --> 27:16.845
What's the matter?

27:19.473 --> 27:21.767
- She's dead!
- Dead?

27:22.017 --> 27:23.352
HeIp, somebody, heIp!

27:23.602 --> 27:25.562
Somebody send for a doctor!

27:25.812 --> 27:26.772
HeIp!

27:27.981 --> 27:29.024
HeIp!

27:29.274 --> 27:30.817
HeIp!

27:32.528 --> 27:34.655
HeIp, somebody, heIp!

27:34.821 --> 27:38.158
HeIp! Bring heIp!
Somebody bring a doctor! HeIp!

27:49.294 --> 27:51.630
Get a cop. I don't know
what's going on.

28:20.367 --> 28:24.538
a man who had a goat

28:24.788 --> 28:27.249
He loved that goat

28:27.499 --> 28:29.710
Indeed he did

28:30.085 --> 28:32.462
He loved that goat

28:32.671 --> 28:35.048
Just like a kid

28:37.342 --> 28:38.343
What's your opinion?

28:38.552 --> 28:40.512
You'II never make the MetropoIitan.

28:42.264 --> 28:43.640
Name's CoIIins.

28:43.891 --> 28:47.227
On sabbaticaI, DeIaware Tech.
GIad to meet you.

28:49.271 --> 28:53.442
I just made a speech in New York
on integration.

28:54.318 --> 28:58.363
In differentiaI caIcuIus,
a function is given...

28:58.614 --> 29:02.326
...and the differentiaI is obtained.
You understand?

29:02.659 --> 29:03.744
Yes, I understand.

29:05.037 --> 29:06.622
You do?

29:09.208 --> 29:11.376
There was a man

29:11.585 --> 29:13.921
Who had a goat...

29:39.321 --> 29:40.447
Guy!

29:46.328 --> 29:47.287
Guy.

29:49.832 --> 29:51.124
Over here, Guy.

30:17.651 --> 30:20.112
- HeIIo, Guy.
- What are you doing here?

30:20.320 --> 30:21.488
At this time of night?

30:21.697 --> 30:24.074
You don't seem very pIeased to see me.

30:24.324 --> 30:27.452
- I've brought you a IittIe present.
- What do you mean?

30:30.247 --> 30:31.957
What's this aII about?

30:32.207 --> 30:33.834
Recognize them?

30:37.963 --> 30:39.089
It was very quick.

30:39.798 --> 30:41.425
She wasn't hurt in any way.

30:41.633 --> 30:43.844
It was aII over in no time.

30:44.469 --> 30:46.638
I knew you'd be surprised.

30:47.639 --> 30:50.809
There's nothing for us to worry about.
Nobody saw me.

30:52.060 --> 30:53.645
OnIy Miriam.

30:54.396 --> 30:56.273
And I was very carefuI, Guy.

30:56.481 --> 31:00.319
Even when I dropped your Iighter,
I went back to pick it up.

31:02.738 --> 31:06.241
Are you trying to teII-?
Why, you maniac!

31:06.533 --> 31:11.455
But you wanted it. We pIanned it
on the train together, remember?

31:11.622 --> 31:14.333
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

31:14.500 --> 31:17.461
- I'm caIIing the poIice, of course.
- But you can't.

31:17.669 --> 31:19.463
We'd both be arrested for murder.

31:19.671 --> 31:23.759
- We'd both be arrested for murder?
- You're just as much in it as I am.

31:24.134 --> 31:26.553
We pIanned it together. Crisscross.

31:26.762 --> 31:29.723
- I do your murder-
- You think you can get away with it?

31:29.932 --> 31:33.852
Oh, come, now. Why shouId I go
to MetcaIf to kiII a totaI stranger?

31:34.061 --> 31:36.980
UnIess it was part of the pIan,
and you were in on it.

31:37.606 --> 31:39.858
You're the one who benefits, Guy.

31:40.108 --> 31:42.444
You're a free man now.

31:43.111 --> 31:45.030
I didn't even know the girI.

31:47.074 --> 31:50.536
I had nothing to do with this.
The poIice wiII beIieve me.

31:50.786 --> 31:52.830
Guy, if you go to the poIice now...

31:53.038 --> 31:56.041
...you'II just be turning yourseIf
in as an accessory.

31:56.291 --> 31:59.419
You see, you have the motive.

32:05.884 --> 32:08.220
- What is it?
- My teIephone.

32:11.473 --> 32:14.226
Someone has some news for you, Guy.

32:19.106 --> 32:20.858
It's the poIice.

32:46.633 --> 32:49.011
You've got me acting
Iike I'm a criminaI.

32:50.137 --> 32:52.764
Why, you crazy fooI!

32:54.600 --> 32:56.685
Don't you caII me that.

33:00.230 --> 33:03.650
Oh, you must be tired, Guy.
I know I am.

33:03.901 --> 33:06.236
I've had a strenuous evening.

33:06.737 --> 33:11.450
But now, about my father. I've got
the pIan of the house aIready made.

33:11.658 --> 33:15.454
And I have an oId Luger pistoI I got
in a pawnshop in San Francisco-

33:16.705 --> 33:19.875
Wait! We have to taIk.
We have to arrange things.

33:20.083 --> 33:22.211
Go, before I give you
what you gave Miriam.

33:22.461 --> 33:24.838
You're not yourseIf, Guy.
You're tired.

33:25.047 --> 33:28.550
When you think things over,
you'II see I'm right. Tomorrow, we-

33:28.800 --> 33:32.095
I never saw you before!
I never want to see you again!

33:32.304 --> 33:33.639
But we have-

33:45.275 --> 33:47.820
Yes? Yes, Anne.

33:48.403 --> 33:50.614
I'm sorry, darIing. I just got in.

33:51.323 --> 33:54.451
Of course I'm aII right.
But you sound upset.

33:54.660 --> 33:56.245
Is anything wrong?

33:57.913 --> 34:00.249
AII right. I'II come over right away.

34:21.603 --> 34:24.022
Anne, darIing, you're trembIing.

34:31.405 --> 34:33.824
I wonder if you know how much
I Iove you.

34:34.366 --> 34:37.034
Brazen woman, I'm the one to say that.

34:45.502 --> 34:47.629
I wanted you to know before...

34:49.380 --> 34:51.216
Father wants to see you.

35:08.525 --> 35:09.484
Good evening, sir.

35:15.324 --> 35:16.241
HeIIo, Babs.

35:19.536 --> 35:22.831
- Something dreadfuI's happened.
- Sit down, Barbara.

35:26.710 --> 35:31.423
There seems to be no way of
dipIomaticaIIy breaking tragic news.

35:31.632 --> 35:34.635
I'm sorry, Guy,
to be the one to teII you.

35:34.843 --> 35:36.845
It concerns your wife.

35:38.055 --> 35:39.181
She's been murdered.

35:41.308 --> 35:43.352
The poIice have been trying
to find you.

35:43.602 --> 35:46.021
You're to caII headquarters
in MetcaIf.

35:49.316 --> 35:50.984
Miriam murdered?

35:51.819 --> 35:53.487
She was strangIed.

35:57.199 --> 35:59.952
It happened on an isIand,
in an amusement park.

36:00.202 --> 36:02.538
It was sort of a Iover's Iane,
I beIieve.

36:02.746 --> 36:04.414
EvidentIy, a sordid atmosphere.

36:04.623 --> 36:08.168
She went there with the boys that
found her, so they're not suspects.

36:08.377 --> 36:09.586
But you wiII be.

36:09.837 --> 36:12.756
We can't overIook that murder
is at our doorstep...

36:12.965 --> 36:14.383
...but don't drag it in here.

36:14.633 --> 36:16.134
Let's not fooI ourseIves.

36:16.343 --> 36:19.471
PoIice wiII say Guy wanted her dead
so he couId marry Anne.

36:19.721 --> 36:22.474
This sort of crime,
they go after the husband.

36:22.724 --> 36:23.934
Guy had every motive.

36:24.810 --> 36:25.769
Motive?

36:26.937 --> 36:28.397
WeII, she's right.

36:28.647 --> 36:31.692
Whichever way you Iook at it,
I'm in a spot.

36:31.900 --> 36:34.403
I'm sure you've got nothing
to worry about.

36:34.820 --> 36:38.198
If he hasn't an aIibi for 9:30,
he has pIenty to worry about.

36:38.407 --> 36:41.160
- You can teII them where you were.
- Sherry.

36:41.368 --> 36:42.536
Thank you.

36:42.953 --> 36:44.037
Can't you, Guy?

36:45.038 --> 36:48.125
9:30? I was on the train
from New York to Washington.

36:48.500 --> 36:49.501
There you are.

36:49.710 --> 36:52.921
Did you see or speak to anyone?
You need a witness.

36:53.130 --> 36:55.174
Yes, I did speak to someone.

36:55.340 --> 36:56.550
Someone you know?

36:56.758 --> 36:57.968
No.

36:58.218 --> 36:59.761
His name was...

37:01.513 --> 37:03.557
CoIIins! He's a professor.

37:04.558 --> 37:05.559
Harvard?

37:05.767 --> 37:07.352
DeIaware Tech.

37:09.104 --> 37:10.898
Then everything's aII right.

37:11.106 --> 37:14.067
Not quite.
He'II stiII have to answer questions.

37:14.276 --> 37:15.611
Routine. Pure routine.

37:15.819 --> 37:18.489
There'II be many reporters here
in the morning.

37:18.697 --> 37:22.242
Daddy doesn't mind a IittIe scandaI.
He's a senator.

37:24.161 --> 37:26.997
It can't be heIped, darIing.
It's not your fauIt.

37:27.247 --> 37:29.666
No one can say you had anything
to do with it.

37:32.169 --> 37:37.007
Someone might say it. I'd do anything
to keep you aII out of this mess.

37:38.050 --> 37:40.344
Be guided by my experience.

37:40.552 --> 37:44.515
Never Iose sIeep over accusations.
UnIess they can be proved, of course.

37:45.224 --> 37:48.602
DreadfuI business. DreadfuI.
Poor, unfortunate girI.

37:48.852 --> 37:50.229
She was a tramp.

37:50.437 --> 37:51.688
She was a human being.

37:51.897 --> 37:55.859
Everyone has a right to Iife
and the pursuit of happiness.

37:56.109 --> 37:58.779
From what I hear,
she pursued it in aII directions.

37:58.946 --> 37:59.738
Barbara!

38:01.824 --> 38:05.369
Father, it's getting terribIy Iate.
Guy Iooks so tired.

38:05.661 --> 38:08.205
Of course, of course.
Back to bed, Barbara.

38:08.455 --> 38:12.167
Nothing stands in your way.
Now you can be married right away.

38:12.376 --> 38:13.585
You're free!

38:14.127 --> 38:16.255
You don't aIways have
to say what you think.

38:16.421 --> 38:17.965
Father, I am not a poIitician.

38:18.215 --> 38:20.008
Remember to caII Captain TurIey.

38:20.259 --> 38:22.135
Yes, sir. Good night.

38:24.054 --> 38:28.559
It'd be wonderfuI to have a man
Iove you so much he'd kiII for you.

38:30.644 --> 38:33.772
I kept saying over and over
I was being siIIy.

38:34.022 --> 38:38.152
But there was one horribIe moment
tonight when the news came through.

38:38.360 --> 38:41.989
I kept remembering what you shouted
on the phone from MetcaIf.

38:42.239 --> 38:43.574
That I couId-

38:45.242 --> 38:46.577
Don't even say it.

38:46.827 --> 38:48.745
Forget you ever said it.

38:48.996 --> 38:51.540
Even more terrifying
than the murder itseIf was...

38:51.790 --> 38:55.002
...the horribIe thought that
if you had done it...

38:55.252 --> 38:58.797
...we wouId have been separated.
Perhaps forever.

38:59.047 --> 39:00.757
I couIdn't stand that.

39:01.008 --> 39:02.551
I couIdn't bear it.

39:15.314 --> 39:18.150
Captain TurIey is expecting me.
Guy Haines.

39:18.400 --> 39:20.360
Just a moment, Mr. Haines.

39:30.454 --> 39:31.538
Come in, pIease.

39:37.461 --> 39:39.796
Good of you to be so prompt,
Mr. Haines.

39:40.047 --> 39:41.715
- This is Lt. CampbeII.
- HeIIo.

39:41.924 --> 39:44.051
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you, sir.

39:44.259 --> 39:48.347
I know you're busy, so we won't detain
you any Ionger than necessary.

39:48.555 --> 39:52.684
You've aIready been good enough to
teII us where you were Iast evening.

39:52.935 --> 39:55.562
We've found the man you spoke with
on the train.

39:55.812 --> 39:58.315
- I saw him outside.
- PIease come in, professor.

40:04.154 --> 40:06.448
Professor CoIIins.
This is Mr. Haines.

40:06.657 --> 40:08.534
You met on the train Iast night.

40:10.619 --> 40:13.997
I'm sorry, but I reaIIy don't
remember meeting this gentIeman.

40:15.916 --> 40:19.336
UnfortunateIy, I remember very IittIe
of our trip from New York.

40:19.545 --> 40:22.089
You see, we had a IittIe ceIebration.

40:22.798 --> 40:25.592
But, we were sitting
opposite each other...

40:25.843 --> 40:27.719
...in the observation car.

40:27.928 --> 40:29.638
You sang a song about a goat.

40:30.180 --> 40:31.139
A goat?

40:31.348 --> 40:33.809
And caIcuIus.
You were going over a speech.

40:34.226 --> 40:35.769
I was?

40:36.645 --> 40:38.772
I'm very sorry, Mr. Haines.

40:39.022 --> 40:41.358
I certainIy must
have been ceIebrating.

40:45.028 --> 40:49.408
Captain, is it so important whether
Professor CoIIins remembers me?

40:49.616 --> 40:52.953
I've been abIe to name a man who was
on the train with me.

40:53.203 --> 40:54.538
You've found him.

40:54.746 --> 40:57.958
Isn't that proof of where I was
at 9:30 Iast night?

41:00.419 --> 41:02.713
Thank you.
HeIIo, dear. Senator. Babs.

41:02.921 --> 41:05.674
- DarIing. Have you had dinner?
- On the train.

41:05.924 --> 41:09.219
You've been in MetcaIf aII this time?
We expected you hours ago.

41:09.428 --> 41:13.348
I didn't. They sometimes Ieave
a suspect in the can aII night.

41:13.599 --> 41:16.351
Sit down, Guy. Sit down.
Barbara, some coffee.

41:16.810 --> 41:19.062
You had no troubIe with the poIice...

41:19.313 --> 41:21.356
...once they verified your aIibi?

41:21.607 --> 41:24.401
When an aIibi is fuII of bourbon,
it can't stand up.

41:24.651 --> 41:26.987
You mean the professor was boiIed?

41:27.237 --> 41:28.489
CompIeteIy.

41:28.739 --> 41:29.948
He didn't remember me.

41:31.116 --> 41:34.828
But you knew he was on the train.
Isn't that proof you were on it too?

41:35.037 --> 41:37.206
ApparentIy, not at the right time.

41:37.456 --> 41:40.667
They suggested I couId have caught
the train at BaItimore.

41:40.918 --> 41:42.961
After Miriam was murdered.

41:43.837 --> 41:46.256
They had it aII worked out
in their timetabIe.

41:46.465 --> 41:50.469
WeII, that's ridicuIous.
They're acting as if you were guiIty.

41:52.054 --> 41:53.680
Everything wiII be aII right.

41:53.931 --> 41:56.350
The poIice were just being thorough.

41:57.017 --> 41:58.185
Weren't they, Daddy?

41:59.436 --> 42:02.189
I certainIy hope so.
What's your next move?

42:04.233 --> 42:06.944
Whatever it is,
the poIice wiII know about it.

42:08.320 --> 42:10.155
Oh, they gave me a present.

42:11.907 --> 42:13.158
Take a Iook.

42:15.994 --> 42:17.746
My guardian angeI.

42:18.038 --> 42:19.581
You're being taiIed.

42:19.957 --> 42:22.167
That's LesIie Hennessy.

42:22.417 --> 42:23.794
He works 16 hours a day.

42:24.044 --> 42:26.338
Somebody eIse takes over
for the next eight.

42:26.547 --> 42:28.549
ActuaIIy, he's a very nice feIIow.

42:28.757 --> 42:30.342
I'II have him caIIed off.

42:30.592 --> 42:33.053
Obstructing the wheeIs
of justice, Daddy?

42:34.012 --> 42:36.306
I'm afraid where I go, Hennessy goes.

42:36.515 --> 42:38.141
Even to the Senate.

42:39.393 --> 42:42.855
- Is he IikeIy to picket my office?
- Very IikeIy.

42:45.649 --> 42:48.861
I wouId suggest, for your own
peace of mind, of course...

42:49.111 --> 42:52.906
...that you work at the house.
It'II be Iess embarrassing for you.

42:53.115 --> 42:57.369
But what about practicing? Perhaps
I'd better forget about Forest HiIIs.

42:58.537 --> 42:59.788
My dear boy...

43:00.038 --> 43:04.585
...wouIdn't it Iook rather awkward if
you suddenIy canceIed aII your pIans?

43:04.835 --> 43:08.005
Right. You mustn't do anything
that Iooks suspicious.

43:08.255 --> 43:12.968
- You must act as if nothing happened.
- Escorted by Mr. Hennessy.

43:15.512 --> 43:18.390
A caII for you, Mr. Haines.
They say it's urgent.

43:18.640 --> 43:19.975
Thank you.

43:21.018 --> 43:22.269
Excuse me.

43:22.519 --> 43:23.520
HeIIo?

43:23.729 --> 43:24.730
HeIIo, Guy.

43:27.774 --> 43:31.153
It must have been some mistake.
It wasn't for me.

43:38.994 --> 43:41.205
I suppose I was Iucky
being seeded fifth.

43:41.455 --> 43:46.168
I've never seen a Forest HiIIs
tournament. I Iook forward to it.

43:46.376 --> 43:48.962
You mean we'II be going
together, Hennessy?

43:49.213 --> 43:50.172
Don't worry.

43:50.422 --> 43:52.966
By that time, this wiII be
aII cIeared up.

43:54.009 --> 43:57.346
- Ever think of turning professionaI?
- I don't have to do that.

43:57.554 --> 43:59.723
After tennis, I'm going into poIitics.

44:00.766 --> 44:03.352
- I hope.
- PoIitics?

44:03.644 --> 44:05.979
It's good I don't report that
to the chief.

44:06.230 --> 44:09.691
If he knew that, he'd put 10 men
on you. He says-

44:09.900 --> 44:12.069
Let's take this cab.
It's getting Iate.

44:13.779 --> 44:18.367
- Pentagon buiIding, pIease.
- Oh, not there. I aIways get Iost.

45:21.513 --> 45:23.140
We better be getting back.

45:23.348 --> 45:27.811
We've actuaIIy been aIone for an hour.
Seems aImost indecent.

45:28.020 --> 45:29.354
You Iike?

45:29.605 --> 45:30.606
I Iike.

45:30.814 --> 45:32.608
I was feeIing Iike a goIdfish.

45:33.609 --> 45:34.485
Guy!

45:39.448 --> 45:40.949
Excuse me.

45:46.538 --> 45:48.332
WiII you stop pestering me?

45:48.582 --> 45:52.169
You're spoiIing everything
by making me come out into the open.

45:54.004 --> 45:55.672
I've tried caIIing you.

45:57.132 --> 45:58.342
Did you get my note?

45:58.717 --> 46:02.429
Why haven't you caIIed? My father
is Ieaving for FIorida next week.

46:02.638 --> 46:06.725
Listen, you- There's a detective
outside. He'II see us together.

46:08.852 --> 46:11.063
Isn't that Anne Morton?

46:13.774 --> 46:16.860
SIight improvement
over Miriam, huh, Guy?

46:18.153 --> 46:20.656
Stay away from me, I'm teIIing you.

46:25.410 --> 46:26.370
Who is it, Guy?

46:26.620 --> 46:29.748
I never saw him before.
Just some tennis fan.

46:36.255 --> 46:38.882
Here's a speciaI deIivery.
It's marked "personaI."

46:39.132 --> 46:41.802
- Thank you.
- You getting any practice today?

46:42.010 --> 46:44.137
Yes, if I can get a court at the cIub.

46:46.390 --> 46:49.226
- Barbara, who are you waving at?
- Mr. Hennessy.

46:49.643 --> 46:52.020
It's a shame Daddy won't Iet us
have him in.

46:54.148 --> 46:56.942
You met him yet, Louise?
He's awfuIIy cute.

47:10.205 --> 47:11.206
- Hi.
- Hi.

47:11.456 --> 47:12.749
- HeIIo, Guy.
- HeIIo.

47:46.241 --> 47:47.951
Okay, you ready, Guy?

47:49.620 --> 47:50.954
Yeah.

48:07.971 --> 48:08.931
Hi, darIing.

48:09.181 --> 48:12.392
This is Mr. Antony, a friend
of Monsieur and Madame DarviIIe.

48:12.768 --> 48:13.769
Guy Haines.

48:14.019 --> 48:16.772
I've been a fan for a Iong time,
Mr. Haines.

48:16.980 --> 48:18.649
I foIIow everything you do.

48:18.857 --> 48:23.362
Mr. Antony has been teIIing us
some charming stories. Very funny.

48:44.633 --> 48:45.634
Guy.

48:48.512 --> 48:53.183
I taIked to your shadow. Did you know
Mr. Hennessy cracked that ax murder?

48:53.392 --> 48:56.562
The one with the body cut up
and hidden in the butcher shop?

48:56.770 --> 48:59.690
He was Iocked in the icebox
with a Ieg for six hours.

48:59.940 --> 49:02.151
He puIIs those things out of his hat.

49:02.359 --> 49:05.195
Who's the interesting Frenchman
with the DarviIIes?

49:06.738 --> 49:08.365
His name's Antony.

49:08.740 --> 49:10.367
He's not French.

49:13.370 --> 49:14.329
How are you?

49:14.788 --> 49:17.457
DeIightfuI to see you, Barbara.
How sweet you Iook.

49:17.624 --> 49:20.502
I hope you won't forget
our party on Thursday, madame.

49:20.711 --> 49:22.796
- We're pIanning on it.
- But of course.

49:23.005 --> 49:25.757
This is my sister.
Barbara, this is Mr. Antony.

49:25.966 --> 49:27.009
How do you do?

49:34.183 --> 49:35.934
Is your name Miriam?

50:12.429 --> 50:13.764
- Hi, Hennessy.
- Hi.

50:14.014 --> 50:15.766
I won't keep you out Iate.

50:16.225 --> 50:18.685
With Forest HiIIs tomorrow,
I've got to sIeep.

50:18.894 --> 50:20.354
That's too bad.

50:20.562 --> 50:22.981
Hammond wiII be on duty
in a coupIe of hours.

50:23.232 --> 50:25.275
I'd Iike to see him earn his saIary.

50:25.526 --> 50:27.569
Doesn't that bIoodhound ever reIax?

50:27.778 --> 50:30.405
He sticks so cIose, he's beginning
to grow on me.

50:30.656 --> 50:31.990
Like a fungus.

50:32.241 --> 50:34.576
He thinks you're
a very suspicious character.

50:34.827 --> 50:38.539
But then he doesn't trust anybody.
Not even himseIf.

50:41.375 --> 50:42.334
Come on, Hennessy.

50:42.543 --> 50:44.753
- Don't forget your sIeeping bag.
- Yeah.

50:45.045 --> 50:47.965
If I wait too Iong on a sidewaIk,
my feet get coId.

50:48.215 --> 50:51.468
- If I sit too Iong on those steps my-
- Don't worry.

50:51.677 --> 50:55.347
Since you toId Barbara about the
icebox, you're her favorite charity.

50:55.556 --> 50:58.767
- She'II send a butIer to defrost you.
- Cute kid.

51:42.603 --> 51:44.188
Good evening, Miss Morton.

51:44.438 --> 51:46.356
This is Mr. Antony, Father.

51:46.565 --> 51:48.942
- Mr. Antony.
- How do you do, sir?

51:49.151 --> 51:51.403
I'd Iike to taIk
with you sometime, sir...

51:51.653 --> 51:55.407
...and teII you about my idea
for harnessing a Iife force.

51:55.657 --> 51:59.369
It'II make atomic power
Iook Iike the horse and buggy.

51:59.620 --> 52:03.665
I'm aIready deveIoping my facuIty
for seeing miIIions of miIes.

52:03.916 --> 52:04.958
And, senator...

52:05.209 --> 52:09.963
...can you imagine being abIe
to smeII a fIower on the pIanet Mars?

52:10.839 --> 52:13.133
I'd Iike to have Iunch
with you soon, sir.

52:13.383 --> 52:14.801
And teII you more about it.

52:15.010 --> 52:16.970
- I'II see you Iater.
- Goodbye.

52:21.391 --> 52:23.769
I don't remember inviting him.
Who is he?

52:24.061 --> 52:25.938
A friend of the DarviIIes.

52:26.980 --> 52:28.857
UnusuaI personaIity.

52:32.694 --> 52:35.239
- Excuse me, aren't you Judge DoIan?
- That's right.

52:35.447 --> 52:37.908
How do you do, sir?
My name is Bruno Antony.

52:38.325 --> 52:40.035
What's he doing here?

52:40.244 --> 52:42.037
I don't know.

52:44.665 --> 52:47.543
After you've sentenced
a man to the chair...

52:47.793 --> 52:51.255
...isn't it difficuIt to go out
and eat your dinner after that?

52:54.466 --> 52:57.970
When a murderer's caught, he's tried.
When convicted, he's sentenced.

52:58.220 --> 53:01.223
When he's sentenced to death,
he must be executed.

53:02.307 --> 53:04.768
- Quite impersonaI, isn't it?
- So it is.

53:05.018 --> 53:07.563
Besides, it doesn't happen every day.

53:07.813 --> 53:09.857
So few murderers are caught.

53:10.107 --> 53:13.652
Mr. Antony, you seem very interested
in the subject of murder.

53:13.902 --> 53:15.362
No more than anyone eIse.

53:15.612 --> 53:18.031
- No more than you, for instance.
- Me?

53:18.490 --> 53:20.242
I'm not interested in murder.

53:20.450 --> 53:23.829
Oh, come now.
Everyone is interested in that.

53:24.079 --> 53:27.166
Everyone has somebody that
they want out of the way.

53:27.416 --> 53:29.960
SureIy, madam,
hasn't there been a time...

53:30.210 --> 53:32.671
...that you didn't want to dispose
of someone?

53:32.921 --> 53:34.631
Your husband, for instance?

53:34.882 --> 53:37.426
Oh, good heavens, no!

53:37.843 --> 53:39.428
Are you sure?

53:39.720 --> 53:44.016
You mean there wasn't a tiny moment
when you were made very angry?

53:44.224 --> 53:45.851
What did you say?

53:47.603 --> 53:51.023
There you are, you see?
There you are.

53:51.523 --> 53:52.649
Now.

53:53.400 --> 53:55.027
You're going to do a murder.

53:56.111 --> 53:59.072
How are you going to do it?
That's the fascinating part.

53:59.281 --> 54:01.617
How wiII you-?
I didn't get your name.

54:01.825 --> 54:02.826
Mrs. Cunningham.

54:03.076 --> 54:05.454
Mrs. Cunningham.
How are you going to do it?

54:05.704 --> 54:08.832
WeII, I suppose I'II have to
get a gun from somewhere.

54:09.291 --> 54:11.335
Oh, no, Mrs. Cunningham.

54:11.585 --> 54:14.713
Bang, bang, bang, aII over the pIace?
BIood everywhere?

54:14.922 --> 54:17.633
- How about a IittIe poison?
- Yes.

54:18.008 --> 54:21.053
- That's better. That's better, Mrs.-
- Anderson.

54:21.261 --> 54:23.013
That's better, Mrs. Anderson.

54:23.514 --> 54:26.433
But you see, Mrs. Cunningham is
in a dreadfuI hurry.

54:26.683 --> 54:28.644
Poison takes from 10 to 12 weeks...

54:28.894 --> 54:31.772
...if poor Mr. Cunningham is to die
from "naturaI causes."

54:33.816 --> 54:35.692
You know, I read of a case once.

54:35.901 --> 54:38.445
I think it wouId be a wonderfuI idea.

54:38.654 --> 54:42.241
I can take him in the car and
when we get to a very IoneIy spot...

54:42.491 --> 54:46.245
...hit him on the head with a hammer,
pour gasoIine over him and the car...

54:46.453 --> 54:49.039
...and set the whoIe thing abIaze.

54:49.832 --> 54:51.333
And waIk aII the way home?

54:52.125 --> 54:53.877
- No?
- Oh, no. No, no.

54:54.086 --> 54:57.047
I have the best way.
And the best tooIs.

54:57.256 --> 55:01.468
SimpIe, siIent and quick. The siIent
part being the most important.

55:01.718 --> 55:03.262
Let me show you what I mean.

55:03.470 --> 55:05.639
May I borrow your neck for a moment?

55:05.889 --> 55:08.392
WeII, if it's not for Iong.

55:17.693 --> 55:22.239
When I nod my head, you try to cry
out, and I'II bet you can't do it.

55:23.031 --> 55:24.616
AII right, now.

55:25.242 --> 55:27.494
Just wait for the nod of my head.

55:54.855 --> 55:59.735
Mr. Antony. Mr. Antony! HeIp!
Somebody, come quick! HeIp!

56:00.861 --> 56:03.238
Somebody, come.
Quick, bring some water!

56:11.663 --> 56:14.625
- Let's get him out of here.
- Bring him into the study.

56:15.918 --> 56:18.212
WiII you heIp me
take her upstairs, pIease?

56:18.879 --> 56:21.089
- What happened?
- He seems to have fainted.

56:21.340 --> 56:23.425
- What about her?
- She was frightened.

56:23.634 --> 56:25.844
They were pIaying a game of some sort.

56:32.851 --> 56:35.646
I thought he was weird
when he arrived. Who is he?

56:35.854 --> 56:37.231
I hardIy know him, sir.

56:37.439 --> 56:40.150
Get him out of here
as soon as you decentIy can.

56:40.400 --> 56:42.236
It's a nice item for the gossips.

56:42.444 --> 56:45.197
First thing you know,
they'II be taIking about orgies.

56:45.405 --> 56:47.616
- I better get back.
- Yes, sir.

56:58.710 --> 57:00.254
What happened?

57:00.462 --> 57:04.216
I was on a merry-go-round somewhere.
It made me dizzy.

57:04.466 --> 57:08.428
You mad, crazy maniac!
You ought to be Iocked up.

57:09.012 --> 57:11.431
WiII you get out of here
and Iet me aIone?

57:12.724 --> 57:14.226
But, Guy...

57:14.518 --> 57:15.519
...I Iike you.

57:23.819 --> 57:25.946
You shouIdn't have done that, Guy.

57:26.697 --> 57:28.490
Come on, puII yourseIf together.

57:35.330 --> 57:37.416
Here, Iet me.

57:40.794 --> 57:42.212
Is your car here?

57:43.130 --> 57:45.048
Driver's outside.

57:45.382 --> 57:46.633
AII right, come on.

58:09.698 --> 58:10.741
What's the matter?

58:11.408 --> 58:12.826
Did you see it happen?

58:13.035 --> 58:14.620
He Iooked at me.

58:15.621 --> 58:18.624
His hands were on her throat...

58:18.874 --> 58:21.126
...and he was strangIing me.

58:21.585 --> 58:22.586
How do you mean?

58:25.339 --> 58:27.758
He was Iooking at her first...

58:28.008 --> 58:29.843
...then Iooked over at me.

58:31.386 --> 58:34.431
He went into sort of a trance.

58:37.100 --> 58:38.685
Oh, it was horribIe!

58:43.690 --> 58:46.443
He thought he was murdering me.

58:50.739 --> 58:52.324
But why me, Anne? Why me?

58:53.325 --> 58:55.244
What did I have to do with it?

58:58.664 --> 59:00.165
Do you know where Guy is?

59:01.291 --> 59:03.252
He went out with that man.

59:06.880 --> 59:08.298
Excuse me.

59:13.220 --> 59:14.429
Guy.

59:24.940 --> 59:28.277
You didn't meet him for the first time
the other day, did you?

59:28.527 --> 59:31.155
- When you introduced us at the cIub?
- Yes.

59:31.363 --> 59:35.492
- Did you see how he stared at Barbara?
- No, I didn't particuIarIy.

59:35.909 --> 59:38.162
He stared at her
the same way tonight.

59:38.412 --> 59:41.165
WhiIe his hands were around
Mrs. Cunningham's throat.

59:42.791 --> 59:44.835
What did Miriam Iook Iike?

59:46.503 --> 59:48.422
Why ask me?
You've seen her picture.

59:48.630 --> 59:50.465
Go on. I want you to teII me.

59:50.716 --> 59:54.344
- She was dark, not too taII, pretty.
- What eIse?

59:54.553 --> 59:55.804
What eIse is there?

59:57.097 --> 59:59.641
She wore gIasses, didn't she, Guy?

01:00:00.017 --> 01:00:01.226
Yes.

01:00:01.852 --> 01:00:04.438
She Iooked something Iike Barbara,
didn't she?

01:00:09.067 --> 01:00:11.111
How did you get him to do it?

01:00:12.529 --> 01:00:14.656
I get him to do it?

01:00:15.449 --> 01:00:18.035
He kiIIed Miriam, didn't he?

01:00:19.536 --> 01:00:21.246
TeII me, didn't he?

01:00:21.872 --> 01:00:23.081
Yes.

01:00:23.332 --> 01:00:26.460
He's a maniac. I met him
on the train going to MetcaIf.

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:30.881
He had a crazy scheme about exchanging
murders. I do his, he'd do mine.

01:00:31.131 --> 01:00:33.675
What do you mean "your" murder, Guy?

01:00:33.884 --> 01:00:36.845
He read about me. He knew
about Miriam, about you.

01:00:37.054 --> 01:00:40.807
He suggested if he got rid of Miriam
for me, I shouId kiII his father.

01:00:41.517 --> 01:00:43.727
You must've known
he was taIking nonsense.

01:00:43.936 --> 01:00:46.772
But he wasn't.
I didn't give it another thought.

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:50.442
And now, a Iunatic wants me
to kiII his father.

01:00:51.652 --> 01:00:52.820
It's too fantastic!

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.404
Yes, isn't it?

01:00:55.697 --> 01:00:58.659
You mean, you've known about Miriam
aII this time?

01:00:59.117 --> 01:01:01.787
Since the first night.
He gave me her gIasses.

01:01:02.329 --> 01:01:04.164
Why didn't you caII the poIice?

01:01:04.665 --> 01:01:06.625
And have them say what you did:

01:01:07.042 --> 01:01:09.837
"Mr. Haines, how did you get him
to do it?"

01:01:10.212 --> 01:01:12.840
And Bruno wouId say
we pIanned it together.

01:01:16.677 --> 01:01:17.970
What are we going to do?

01:01:18.178 --> 01:01:20.639
I don't know, Anne. I don't know!

01:01:21.181 --> 01:01:24.101
We'd better go inside.
Hennessy is watching us.

01:01:24.309 --> 01:01:27.688
This is why I didn't want you
to know anything about it.

01:01:27.938 --> 01:01:31.066
I wanted to protect aII of you.
Barbara, your father.

01:01:31.316 --> 01:01:33.610
Now that you know,
you're acting guiIty too.

01:01:36.738 --> 01:01:38.824
If we couId onIy taIk to father, to-

01:01:39.074 --> 01:01:40.075
It's not good.

01:01:40.409 --> 01:01:42.619
I mustn't drag anyone eIse into this.

01:01:44.413 --> 01:01:46.248
Come on, Iet's go.

01:01:51.461 --> 01:01:52.838
HeIIo, Hammond.

01:01:55.257 --> 01:01:56.425
You Iook worried.

01:01:56.633 --> 01:01:59.636
Keep on your toes.
Something funny's going on.

01:02:21.992 --> 01:02:23.160
Bruno?

01:02:23.577 --> 01:02:25.537
Yes, yes, it's Guy.

01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:28.165
I've decided to do what you want.

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:30.959
I'II make that IittIe visit
to your father.

01:02:31.835 --> 01:02:33.337
How about tonight?

01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:37.341
Yes, I want to get
this thing over with.

01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:39.343
Does anyone know you've come home?

01:02:40.052 --> 01:02:43.555
You'd better sIip out again.
And stay out tiII after dayIight.

01:07:00.521 --> 01:07:01.522
Mr. Antony.

01:07:03.315 --> 01:07:04.650
Mr. Antony.

01:07:05.108 --> 01:07:08.862
Don't be aIarmed. I must taIk
to you about your son, Bruno.

01:07:12.324 --> 01:07:13.826
Yes, Mr. Haines?

01:07:19.915 --> 01:07:22.668
My father isn't home tonight,
Mr. Haines.

01:07:22.918 --> 01:07:25.212
I was about to teII you that
on the phone.

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:27.673
But you made such a sudden decision.

01:07:27.923 --> 01:07:29.633
I wondered why.

01:07:29.967 --> 01:07:33.136
You sent me the key to your house.
I decided to use it...

01:07:33.387 --> 01:07:35.931
...to make a IittIe sociaI caII
on your father.

01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:39.518
I thought he'd be interested to know
he has a Iunatic son.

01:07:42.896 --> 01:07:47.359
I assume that you have no intention
of going ahead with our arrangement?

01:07:47.609 --> 01:07:50.737
None whatsoever. I never had.

01:07:51.321 --> 01:07:52.739
I see.

01:07:53.115 --> 01:07:55.909
WeII, then, you'II have
no further use for my key.

01:08:00.164 --> 01:08:01.707
Nor this.

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:04.501
Look, Bruno.

01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:06.879
You're terribIy sick.

01:08:07.087 --> 01:08:11.133
I don't know much about these things,
but why don't you get some treatment?

01:08:11.383 --> 01:08:12.759
Not onIy for your sake...

01:08:13.218 --> 01:08:17.096
...but you can't go on causing
destruction to everyone you meet.

01:08:21.185 --> 01:08:23.520
I don't Iike to be doubIe-crossed.

01:08:24.729 --> 01:08:28.358
I have a murder on my conscience,
but it's not my murder.

01:08:28.609 --> 01:08:30.109
It's yours.

01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:34.698
Since you profit by it, I think you
shouId be the one to pay for it.

01:08:35.616 --> 01:08:37.743
WeII, I guess it's no use, Bruno.

01:08:37.993 --> 01:08:40.703
We seem to have nothing further
to discuss.

01:09:23.663 --> 01:09:25.957
Don't worry.
I'm not going to shoot you.

01:09:26.207 --> 01:09:28.126
It might disturb Mother.

01:09:28.585 --> 01:09:30.337
I'm a very cIever feIIow.

01:09:30.546 --> 01:09:34.174
I'II think of something better
than that. Much better.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:48.522
He came back at 3:25. I didn't even
know he was gone...

01:09:48.729 --> 01:09:50.899
...untiI his phone rang
for haIf an hour.

01:09:51.108 --> 01:09:54.444
Nobody sIeeps that sound, so the
janitor Iet me in. No Haines.

01:09:54.653 --> 01:09:55.612
Wonder where he went?

01:09:55.821 --> 01:09:58.490
- ProbabIy hear of another dead dame.
- Shut up!

01:09:58.699 --> 01:10:02.703
How about I contact MetcaIf?
There's cause for more questioning.

01:10:02.953 --> 01:10:04.913
Questioning? Let's take him in.

01:10:05.122 --> 01:10:06.331
My dear Mr. Hammond...

01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:09.918
...how many times must I teII you
that we have nothing concIusive?

01:10:10.127 --> 01:10:14.548
There's no evidence he was ever at
the crime scene. Can't you get that?

01:10:14.798 --> 01:10:17.092
Just stay put tiII I get back here.

01:10:23.098 --> 01:10:24.433
Miss Morton, reaIIy.

01:10:24.683 --> 01:10:27.811
I know Bruno's been in some very
awkward scrapes...

01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:30.314
...but nothing so ridicuIous
as a murder.

01:10:30.522 --> 01:10:34.193
Mrs. Antony, you have to make him
do something about this.

01:10:34.401 --> 01:10:36.111
Don't you see that just one word
from him...

01:10:36.361 --> 01:10:38.655
...wouId get Guy out of this dreadfuI
situation?

01:10:38.864 --> 01:10:40.407
But, Miss Morton...

01:10:40.616 --> 01:10:44.828
...I'm sure that this whoIe thing
is just some practicaI joke.

01:10:45.078 --> 01:10:49.082
You know, Bruno, he sometimes goes
a IittIe too far.

01:10:51.001 --> 01:10:54.046
I reaIIy shouIdn't be saying
this to an outsider...

01:10:54.296 --> 01:10:57.591
...but sometimes he's terribIy
irresponsibIe...

01:10:57.841 --> 01:11:01.011
...and gets into aII kinds
of escapades.

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:03.806
Don't you understand, Mrs. Antony?

01:11:04.097 --> 01:11:07.059
Your son is responsibIe
for a woman's death.

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:09.394
Did Bruno teII you this?

01:11:10.145 --> 01:11:11.772
WeII, of course not, Mrs. Antony.

01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:13.190
WeII, there you are.

01:11:14.066 --> 01:11:17.444
WeII, now, Miss Morton, it's very nice
of you to caII...

01:11:17.694 --> 01:11:20.447
...and if you'II excuse me, I must
get back to my painting.

01:11:21.865 --> 01:11:24.034
Do you care for painting, Miss Morton?

01:11:24.284 --> 01:11:26.662
I find it very soothing.

01:11:28.872 --> 01:11:30.791
Come see us again sometime.

01:11:44.221 --> 01:11:45.556
Oh, Miss Morton.

01:11:46.765 --> 01:11:49.601
I'm afraid that Mother wasn't
very much heIp, was she?

01:11:49.852 --> 01:11:52.020
She hasn't been weII
for a Iong time.

01:11:52.271 --> 01:11:55.023
She's a IittIe, how shouId I say?
Confused.

01:11:55.274 --> 01:11:56.775
Poor Mother.

01:11:58.068 --> 01:12:00.445
You know, I'm very upset with Guy.

01:12:00.696 --> 01:12:03.824
He shouIdn't have sent you
on an errand Iike this.

01:12:04.074 --> 01:12:06.577
Guy doesn't know I'm here,
Mr. Antony.

01:12:07.578 --> 01:12:09.830
He's Ied you up the garden path,
I'm afraid.

01:12:10.873 --> 01:12:13.542
He must be very desperate,
to try to invoIve me.

01:12:13.792 --> 01:12:16.712
I've been protecting him ever since
that conversation on the train...

01:12:16.962 --> 01:12:19.631
...when he toId me
how much he hated his wife.

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:28.724
He tried to get me to go back
to the isIand one night after dark...

01:12:28.974 --> 01:12:32.060
...to pick up his Iighter
so the poIice wouIdn't find it?

01:12:32.311 --> 01:12:36.231
He dropped it there, you know, when-
WeII, that night.

01:12:36.899 --> 01:12:38.942
AII the poIice are waiting for...

01:12:39.151 --> 01:12:41.778
...is one piece of evidence
to convict Guy.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.240
It's had me so worried.

01:12:45.741 --> 01:12:49.286
But of course, I couIdn't do it.
It wouId be too risky.

01:12:49.536 --> 01:12:52.623
And besides, it wouId make me
an accessory.

01:12:54.666 --> 01:12:58.420
Oh, Miss Morton. I understand
how you feeI.

01:12:59.379 --> 01:13:02.174
Now, I'm sorry, but I have
an urgent appointment.

01:13:03.842 --> 01:13:05.844
I reaIIy must go now.

01:13:37.251 --> 01:13:39.169
He said if the poIice found
your Iighter...

01:13:39.419 --> 01:13:42.297
...that's aII they'd need to prove
you were at the scene.

01:13:42.506 --> 01:13:46.385
That Iie about the Iighter means
he'II put it on that isIand.

01:13:47.052 --> 01:13:50.430
I wanted to heIp, but I'm afraid
aII I did is make things worse.

01:13:50.681 --> 01:13:53.392
Going there after you did
onIy made him more furious.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:57.271
No, darIing. He said Iast night
he'd think of something.

01:13:58.355 --> 01:13:59.565
He certainIy has.

01:13:59.773 --> 01:14:03.277
Guy, you've got to get to MetcaIf
before he does.

01:14:03.527 --> 01:14:05.779
You haven't time to pIay.
You'd better teII them.

01:14:05.988 --> 01:14:09.616
If they announce I won't pIay,
Hennessy wiII be suspicious.

01:14:09.867 --> 01:14:11.660
He'II keep me from
getting near MetcaIf.

01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:13.829
- WeII, then, I'II go.
- No, Anne.

01:14:14.037 --> 01:14:16.665
Stay here and heIp me give
Hennessy the sIip after the match.

01:14:16.915 --> 01:14:18.500
But, darIing, that'II be too Iate.

01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:22.254
Didn't Bruno say I wanted him to go
there one night after dark?

01:14:22.504 --> 01:14:24.464
- Yes.
- That's what's in his mind now.

01:14:24.715 --> 01:14:26.842
He won't expose himseIf
in broad dayIight.

01:14:27.092 --> 01:14:29.720
If I can finish in three
sets, I'II stiII-

01:14:29.928 --> 01:14:31.805
You're on in a few minutes, Guy.

01:14:32.014 --> 01:14:34.850
- Miss Morton.
- Okay, Tim. I'II be right there.

01:14:36.101 --> 01:14:38.145
This is what I think we'd better do.

01:14:38.353 --> 01:14:40.272
If TurIey said to, Iet's pick him up.

01:14:40.522 --> 01:14:42.357
Let him have his game first.

01:14:42.608 --> 01:14:44.735
First time I ever waited
for a murder suspect...

01:14:44.943 --> 01:14:47.029
...to pIay tennis before
I puIIed him in.

01:14:47.279 --> 01:14:49.281
If headquarters hears
about this, they'II-

01:14:53.494 --> 01:14:56.038
- Good Iuck, Guy.
- Thanks.

01:14:59.583 --> 01:15:00.834
You got it straight.

01:15:01.084 --> 01:15:05.214
Make sure Barbara has everything ready
as soon as the third set starts.

01:15:26.735 --> 01:15:28.904
Ladies and gentIemen,
your attention, pIease.

01:15:29.530 --> 01:15:31.740
This men's singIes match wiII be...

01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:35.619
...between Mr. Guy Haines
and Mr. Fred ReynoIds.

01:15:45.879 --> 01:15:49.424
On the other hand, Guy Haines is
a quiet, methodicaI pIayer...

01:15:49.633 --> 01:15:50.843
...aImost IackadaisicaI.

01:15:51.093 --> 01:15:54.638
As a ruIe, he pIays sIowIy between
points, weII within himseIf.

01:15:54.847 --> 01:15:56.181
Linesmen ready?

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.058
PIay.

01:16:04.523 --> 01:16:06.066
Fifteen-Iove.

01:16:12.322 --> 01:16:13.657
Thirty-Iove.

01:16:26.628 --> 01:16:27.838
Thirty-fifteen.

01:16:38.307 --> 01:16:40.058
Forty-fifteen.

01:16:49.443 --> 01:16:50.360
FauIt.

01:17:02.706 --> 01:17:07.628
Game, Mr. Haines. He Ieads,
one game to Iove, first set.

01:17:18.222 --> 01:17:19.848
Union Station.

01:17:26.313 --> 01:17:28.482
Guy Haines is hitting harder,
hurrying up the pIay...

01:17:28.732 --> 01:17:30.818
...taking chances
I've never seen him take.

01:17:31.068 --> 01:17:34.738
This is a compIete reversaI of his
usuaI watch-and-wait strategy.

01:17:42.746 --> 01:17:43.747
Forty-thirty.

01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:30.836
Oh, may I have a Iight, pIease?

01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:44.224
Thanks.

01:18:56.320 --> 01:19:00.407
Game, Haines. He Ieads, one game
to Iove, third set.

01:19:00.616 --> 01:19:02.951
Guy Haines has caught
the first two sets very easiIy.

01:19:03.202 --> 01:19:06.413
And if he keeps going, it'II be a
straight-set win for him, sure.

01:19:07.289 --> 01:19:10.959
Look, if he wins this next set,
you'd better have everything ready.

01:19:11.210 --> 01:19:13.462
Give the driver this 10 doIIars.

01:19:13.712 --> 01:19:15.881
I wish I understood what
this is aII about.

01:19:16.131 --> 01:19:18.342
I'II teII you that Iater.
PIease hurry.

01:19:48.705 --> 01:19:50.249
Forty-Iove.

01:20:04.221 --> 01:20:05.556
Game, Mr. ReynoIds.

01:20:06.306 --> 01:20:08.142
Advantage, Mr. ReynoIds.

01:20:09.017 --> 01:20:10.686
Game, Mr. ReynoIds.

01:20:10.894 --> 01:20:11.854
He Ieads.

01:20:12.104 --> 01:20:14.356
I may have spoken too soon
when I said...

01:20:14.606 --> 01:20:16.150
...that this match Iooked
to be about over.

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:18.569
ReynoIds is knocking on the door.

01:20:32.249 --> 01:20:34.042
Game, Mr. ReynoIds.

01:20:34.293 --> 01:20:36.211
Mr. ReynoIds wins the third set.

01:20:36.503 --> 01:20:39.256
Mr. Haines Ieading, two sets to one.

01:21:12.331 --> 01:21:14.458
The set score is now 2-1.
Guy Haines Ieading...

01:21:14.708 --> 01:21:16.668
...and we're 10-aII
in the fourth set.

01:21:16.919 --> 01:21:20.672
This match, from a quick victory for
Haines, has turned into a dogfight.

01:21:30.599 --> 01:21:31.391
Thirty-aII.

01:21:33.477 --> 01:21:37.773
Down there. My cigarette case.
It's very vaIuabIe.

01:21:37.981 --> 01:21:40.859
- Down here?
- Yes, get that grate up right away.

01:21:41.109 --> 01:21:42.361
What's the troubIe?

01:21:42.611 --> 01:21:44.863
Can't we do something?
I dropped my cigarette case.

01:21:45.113 --> 01:21:48.617
It mightn't be any good.
ProbabIy gone down the storm drain.

01:21:48.992 --> 01:21:50.744
Maybe it Iodged on the edge.

01:21:50.994 --> 01:21:54.039
Don't they have a trap down there,
Iike under a sink?

01:21:54.289 --> 01:21:56.291
Don't just stand here, do something!

01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.836
I guess we couId phone
the city engineer.

01:21:59.044 --> 01:22:01.421
Worst he couId do is teII me
to take a running jump-

01:22:01.630 --> 01:22:05.050
- ReIax, mister.
- I don't want to reIax.

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:14.726
Game, Mr. Haines.

01:22:14.977 --> 01:22:16.687
Guy Haines is mighty grim
and determined.

01:22:16.937 --> 01:22:19.815
He needs but one more game
for the entire match.

01:22:51.597 --> 01:22:52.764
Forty-thirty.

01:22:52.973 --> 01:22:55.476
Just one point between Haines
and the match!

01:23:02.858 --> 01:23:03.817
Deuce.

01:23:18.207 --> 01:23:20.250
Advantage, Mr. Haines.

01:23:28.926 --> 01:23:29.718
Deuce.

01:23:50.739 --> 01:23:52.157
Advantage, Mr. Haines.

01:24:09.508 --> 01:24:12.427
You must think a Iot of that,
whatever it is.

01:24:17.015 --> 01:24:20.853
Game, set and match, Mr. Haines.

01:24:35.909 --> 01:24:38.245
Taxi's waiting at the entrance.

01:24:46.003 --> 01:24:49.548
Isn't it wonderfuI? He won.
It caIIs for a ceIebration.

01:24:49.798 --> 01:24:52.259
- I'm sorry. Let me.
- It's quite aII right.

01:24:53.677 --> 01:24:57.055
Anne says you must have
dinner with us tonight.

01:24:57.306 --> 01:24:58.682
I may be out of town.

01:24:58.932 --> 01:25:01.685
But you'II be with Guy,
won't you?

01:25:01.894 --> 01:25:03.437
I'm sorry. I wish I couId.

01:25:10.527 --> 01:25:13.238
You waiting for me? Penn Station.

01:25:21.079 --> 01:25:22.414
Come on.

01:25:26.877 --> 01:25:28.754
We need your heIp.
We're chasing a man.

01:25:29.004 --> 01:25:31.840
ReaIIy? How exciting!

01:26:35.904 --> 01:26:37.447
Where'd that man buy a ticket for?

01:26:37.656 --> 01:26:38.615
- MetcaIf.
- Let's get him.

01:26:38.824 --> 01:26:42.369
Let him go. This may Iead
to something big.

01:26:42.619 --> 01:26:45.247
We'II phone MetcaIf and Iet
them take over at that end.

01:27:17.571 --> 01:27:19.698
What time does it get dark
around here?

01:27:22.159 --> 01:27:23.911
What's the hurry?

01:27:24.286 --> 01:27:27.331
- What time does it get dark, I said.
- Oh, soon enough.

01:27:36.048 --> 01:27:38.050
- Excuse me.
- It's quite aII right.

01:27:38.258 --> 01:27:41.470
- When do we get into BaItimore?
- In about 30 minutes.

01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:43.555
Late again, huh?

01:27:50.562 --> 01:27:52.689
Nice business he's doing over there
since the murder.

01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:54.942
PeopIe want to see the scene
of the crime.

01:27:55.192 --> 01:27:58.028
Come on, come on. Come cIoser.
Here we are.

01:27:58.278 --> 01:28:00.656
It's not a very nice way
to make money.

01:28:00.864 --> 01:28:03.492
WeII, heck.
Boatkeepers gotta eat too.

01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:05.911
Business feII off something terribIe
for a whiIe.

01:28:06.161 --> 01:28:08.872
The smoochers wouIdn't
go near the pIace.

01:28:09.540 --> 01:28:12.292
I'm afraid I don't know
what a smoocher is.

01:28:12.751 --> 01:28:15.879
Okay. So I ain't educated.

01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:59.381
Amusement park. Quick.

01:29:07.222 --> 01:29:09.391
He's gone to the amusement park.

01:29:09.850 --> 01:29:13.187

01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:36.390

01:35:40.532 --> 01:35:43.410
He says this isn't the man we want.
It's the other one.

01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:45.787
- The one he was fighting with.
- What do you mean?

01:35:46.330 --> 01:35:47.372
Not Haines?

01:35:47.539 --> 01:35:49.666
- But you pointed him out.
- No, I didn't, sir.

01:35:49.917 --> 01:35:53.295
I've never seen this man before.
I meant the other one.

01:35:53.462 --> 01:35:54.713
What's this aII about, Haines?

01:35:54.922 --> 01:35:56.256
He has my Iighter.

01:35:56.507 --> 01:35:59.885
He wanted to pIant it on the isIand,
to pin the whoIe thing on me.

01:36:00.093 --> 01:36:02.721
Let me taIk to him. Let me show you.

01:36:02.930 --> 01:36:03.889

Take it easy, paI.

01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:09.812
We can't move it.
It's too heavy.

01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:14.525
- He's in a bad way.
- Can't you get it off him?

01:36:14.775 --> 01:36:17.486
They've done everything

01:36:18.362 --> 01:36:20.280

01:36:49.351 --> 01:36:51.562
It's on the isIand where you Ieft it.

01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:55.858
Bruno, don't keep it up.
Not at a time Iike this.

01:36:56.358 --> 01:36:58.485
- You know that-
- I'm sorry, Guy.

01:36:58.735 --> 01:37:03.282
I want to heIp you, but I don't know
what I can do.

01:37:04.449 --> 01:37:07.411
Captain TurIey, can't I go
through his pockets?

01:37:07.619 --> 01:37:10.289
Of course not.
Besides, he says he hasn't got it.

01:37:10.539 --> 01:37:12.291
I think he's going.

01:37:17.337 --> 01:37:18.881
He's finished.

01:37:27.973 --> 01:37:29.057

WeII, you were right.

01:37:32.478 --> 01:37:34.396
Better keep this for the time being.

01:37:34.646 --> 01:37:38.692
We'II cIear this up in the morning.
How about staying overnight?

01:37:38.901 --> 01:37:42.279
I imagine there's a Iot you want

01:37:42.488 --> 01:37:45.657
Okay, Captain TurIey. Thanks.
