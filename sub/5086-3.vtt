WEBVTT

00:19.767 --> 00:20.900
Hey babe, you hungry?

00:20.933 --> 00:23.333
I think the locusts might
have left you a few crumbs.

00:23.367 --> 00:26.067
Yeah!
I'll just grab a quick uh-

00:28.633 --> 00:30.400
I didn't take
the last slice.

00:30.433 --> 00:32.600
Carb-free is
healthier for you.

00:32.633 --> 00:34.533
We have other
carb-free options.

00:34.567 --> 00:37.533
We have soup, salad,
smoothie.

00:37.567 --> 00:38.733
Sundae?

00:38.767 --> 00:41.867
That's tempting, but no.
I'll grab something at work.

00:41.900 --> 00:43.233
Work? It's Saturday.

00:43.267 --> 00:45.000
Saturday is the
day of catching up.

00:45.033 --> 00:46.433
For me that means paperwork.

00:46.467 --> 00:48.033
As for the rest of you...

00:48.067 --> 00:50.733
Your dad-slash-uncle has
great plans in store for you.

00:50.767 --> 00:53.267
That sounds horrible.

00:53.300 --> 00:54.600
I want you to work hard,

00:54.633 --> 00:56.867
I want big appetites: I'm
making family dinner tonight.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.000
Yes!

00:58.033 --> 00:59.200
Bye!

01:00.267 --> 01:02.933
Alright, bye!

01:04.433 --> 01:06.967
Wait, so my Saturday
is no longer my own?

01:07.067 --> 01:08.133
Yeah.

01:08.167 --> 01:10.500
You and Mariah need to deal
with that clothes closet.

01:10.533 --> 01:11.467
We already did!

01:11.500 --> 01:13.500
Yes, but it looks
like you threw

01:13.533 --> 01:15.567
a stick of dynamite in
there and walked away.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.200
I built a rolling
rack in the attic.

01:17.233 --> 01:18.967
All the winter stuff
can go up there.

01:19.067 --> 01:20.867
Anything that hasn't been
worn in six months

01:20.900 --> 01:22.200
goes to Goodwill.
Be ruthless.

01:22.233 --> 01:24.300
Boys, you're with me.

01:24.333 --> 01:25.367
Are we being punished?

01:25.400 --> 01:27.633
No, you're being given
an opportunity to do some

01:27.667 --> 01:29.067
post-construction clean-up.

01:29.067 --> 01:31.067
Aren't there some
child labor laws?

01:31.100 --> 01:32.700
I pay a fair wage.

01:32.733 --> 01:33.733
Ten bucks an hour?

01:33.767 --> 01:34.800
How 'bout fifteen?

01:34.833 --> 01:35.900
How about five?

01:35.933 --> 01:36.600
Ten works.

01:36.633 --> 01:38.467
Hold on,
why do they get paid?

01:38.500 --> 01:40.333
Whatever change you
find in the pockets

01:40.367 --> 01:42.067
of those jeans you're gonna
clean, you can keep.

01:42.100 --> 01:43.867
And why don't they
have to do closets?

01:43.900 --> 01:47.400
Because we Goodwilled
the first time Mom asked.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.200
Retire to your respective
corners, come out cleaning.

01:57.833 --> 01:59.900
Don't all jump up at once.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.667
Number four,
that's definitely him.

02:05.700 --> 02:06.300
You're sure?

02:06.333 --> 02:07.200
Yeah, 100%.

02:07.233 --> 02:08.800
And you'd swear
to that in court?

02:08.833 --> 02:09.800
Absolutely.

02:09.833 --> 02:10.933
Thank you, Mr. Martin.

02:10.967 --> 02:13.833
If you'd wait outside,
we'll bring your wife in now.

02:18.167 --> 02:20.167
e're ready for you!W

02:23.867 --> 02:26.833
Mrs. Martin,
Do you see the man

02:26.867 --> 02:29.533
you found breaking into
your home last night?

02:29.567 --> 02:35.500
I do... number two.

02:35.533 --> 02:38.667
Do you wear glasses or
contacts, Mrs. Martin?

02:38.700 --> 02:41.200
No, my vision is perfect.

02:41.233 --> 02:42.700
Is there a problem,
Lieutenant?

02:42.733 --> 02:45.067
No. Thanks for taking the
time to come down.

02:45.067 --> 02:48.300
Detectives Hernandez and
Lee will follow up with you.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.600
Lieutenant, can I
get a signature?

02:55.633 --> 02:59.067
Didn't realize you're spending
Saturday with us, McLean.

02:59.067 --> 03:01.067
Hope yours
is more productive.

03:01.067 --> 03:03.700
That'll be all gentlemen,
thank you for the assistance.

03:03.733 --> 03:05.067
Even though that
didn't assist.

03:05.067 --> 03:09.067
Scooped up a guy for B and E,
Mr. Martin ID's him no problem.

03:09.067 --> 03:10.800
Mrs. Martin picks
Lenny from Processing.

03:10.833 --> 03:12.833
Back to square one.

03:16.067 --> 03:17.933
Reassemble the line.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.100
What are you doing?

03:25.633 --> 03:28.300
Number Four, step forward.

03:29.767 --> 03:32.300
Even she picks the right guy.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.167
That's the guy
who shot me.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.233
Get Devin in here.

03:42.267 --> 03:44.100
No need, he didn't
get eyes on him.

03:44.133 --> 03:46.067
He won't be able
to ID him.

03:46.067 --> 03:48.700
Are you sure?
It's been two years.

03:50.933 --> 03:52.900
I will never
forget that face.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.600
Lieutenant, how do
you want to play this?

03:54.633 --> 03:56.267
Without a positive ID
from the homeowners,

03:56.300 --> 03:57.300
can we even hold him?

03:57.333 --> 03:58.300
We have to!

03:58.333 --> 03:59.733
How long have
you had him?

03:59.767 --> 04:01.567
We picked him up
around 8 AM.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.900
We can hold him for today
without ruffling feathers.

04:03.933 --> 04:06.633
Even a bit more if his
paperwork gets misfiled.

04:06.667 --> 04:08.867
But if he lawyers up, we
won't even make the day.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.067
So we have 18 hours

04:10.067 --> 04:12.567
to prove that he's our
shooter or he walks?

04:12.600 --> 04:14.200
He is not walking.

04:14.233 --> 04:15.767
This is priority one.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.633
This man shot one
of our own.

04:17.667 --> 04:19.367
Nobody sleeps
until we get

04:19.400 --> 04:22.967
an attempted murder
charge that sticks.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.567
I searched and searched
for this face,

04:43.600 --> 04:46.767
and now Seattle has
a file on him?

04:46.800 --> 04:50.167
Vern Keeler, 43,
no fixed address.

04:50.200 --> 04:53.067
Multiple arrests,
mostly drug related.

04:53.100 --> 04:54.833
Oh and yes, his
fix is oxycodone.

04:54.867 --> 04:56.267
Why is
the oxy relevant?

04:56.300 --> 04:57.733
Harper Park was Oxy Central.

04:57.767 --> 04:59.600
We were staked out by
the parking lot

04:59.633 --> 05:02.067
grabbing photos to build
a case for a sweep.

05:02.100 --> 05:03.067
Yeah, oxy dealer.

05:03.067 --> 05:04.733
We moved in to try
to get clearer shots,

05:04.767 --> 05:07.133
but this is the best we got
and we could never ID him.

05:07.167 --> 05:08.700
As we're maneuvering
to a better position,

05:08.733 --> 05:10.200
a guy in a hoodie
walks right up,

05:10.233 --> 05:11.567
sticks a gun in
the dealer's face.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.733
Takes off with his
pills and his cash.

05:13.767 --> 05:15.300
So we move in,
Hoodie Guy fires.

05:15.333 --> 05:17.667
Next thing I'm waking up
at Sisters of Mercy

05:17.700 --> 05:18.900
with a hole
in my shoulder.

05:18.933 --> 05:20.567
She flat-lined
in the ambulance.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.067
Lucky to be alive.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.300
Now if Wilkes
annoys me,

05:24.333 --> 05:27.200
I threaten to apply
for death benefits.

05:27.233 --> 05:29.633
So you're saying the guy in
the hoodie is Keeler in holding?

05:29.667 --> 05:32.367
Yeah, now we just
have to prove it.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.900
These photos
aren't gonna help.

05:33.933 --> 05:36.367
That could be him or it
could be my mechanic.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.667
What's his
sheet look like?

05:38.700 --> 05:41.167
Multiple felony arrests,
including checking every box

05:41.200 --> 05:42.567
under theft
and robbery.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.167
All reduced or dropped
to misdemeanors.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.500
Clean file for
someone so dirty.

05:46.533 --> 05:48.067
He knows how to
work the system.

05:48.067 --> 05:49.667
When's the last time
he got picked up?

05:49.700 --> 05:51.500
Assault charge in Seattle on
a minor league bottom-feeder

05:51.533 --> 05:52.567
named Wade Tilson.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.067
Tilson declined to pursue.

05:54.067 --> 05:55.133
Got a date on that?

05:55.167 --> 05:57.233
Yeah, two years ago,
November 28th.

05:57.267 --> 05:58.767
That's three days
after I was shot.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.333
We gotta talk
to this guy.

06:00.367 --> 06:01.467
Keeler kept his
nose clean since?

06:01.500 --> 06:03.933
You'd go dark too if you
were wanted for shooting blue.

06:03.967 --> 06:05.533
Or head for another
jurisdiction.

06:05.567 --> 06:07.867
If we cross
Keeler's mug shot

06:07.900 --> 06:09.300
with oxy arrests made
in other states,

06:09.333 --> 06:11.100
we might track arrests made
under a different alias.

06:11.133 --> 06:11.633
On it.

06:11.667 --> 06:12.800
Wait!

06:12.833 --> 06:14.633
If we give that to a uniform,
that frees you and Victoria

06:14.667 --> 06:17.133
to go to Harper Park and canvass
the area with his picture.

06:17.167 --> 06:18.700
The crowd doesn't
change over much there.

06:18.733 --> 06:21.367
They might be able to place
him at the time of the robbery.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.133
And we'll track down...
what's his name?

06:23.167 --> 06:24.133
Tilson.

06:24.167 --> 06:25.767
Tilson and any
other known associates.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.367
I've got a current
address for Tilson.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.100
I'm betting he
doesn't get out much.

06:29.133 --> 06:30.700
We'll head to the
park right now.

06:30.733 --> 06:31.600
Okay.

06:31.633 --> 06:32.700
You ready?

06:32.733 --> 06:34.067
Almost.

06:39.133 --> 06:40.067
Hello?

06:40.067 --> 06:43.600
Hi...
you got a minute?

06:43.633 --> 06:46.067
Yeah baby, what's wrong?

06:46.067 --> 06:48.633
I hate to do this to you,
but we got a situation here.

06:48.667 --> 06:51.800
I don't think I'll be
home for a little while.

06:51.833 --> 06:54.433
What is it?
What's going on?

06:54.467 --> 06:57.767
The guy who
shot me is here.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.067
In holding.

06:59.067 --> 07:00.367
You got him?

07:00.400 --> 07:03.267
No, the only thing connecting
him to my shooting is my say-so.

07:03.300 --> 07:06.267
So we're gonna have to build the
case before the clock runs out.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.267
Do whatever it
takes to nail him.

07:08.300 --> 07:10.100
No need to
worry the kids.

07:10.133 --> 07:11.167
Of course.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.967
I don't know when I'm
going to be home.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.133
That's not a problem.

07:15.167 --> 07:17.300
Baby, what matters
is this guy pays.

07:17.333 --> 07:21.133
Whatever you
need, I'm here, okay?

07:21.167 --> 07:21.900
I love you.

07:21.933 --> 07:23.267
I love you too.

07:23.300 --> 07:26.067
Okay, bye sweetie.

07:34.433 --> 07:37.800
You okay Dad?
Was that Mom?

07:37.833 --> 07:39.100
Yeah, it was.

07:39.133 --> 07:40.300
She okay?

07:40.333 --> 07:42.267
Yeah, she's fine.

07:42.300 --> 07:44.567
She was calling to
tell me to remind you

07:44.600 --> 07:46.833
to do everything I say.

07:46.867 --> 07:50.333
And do it with a smile.
Let's go!

08:08.533 --> 08:11.900
We appreciate your taking time
to pay us a visit, Tilson.

08:11.933 --> 08:14.633
I'm always up for a
change of scenery.

08:15.633 --> 08:17.700
Especially when
it's a nice view.

08:17.733 --> 08:21.133
Hey, eyes here.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.167
Recognize this guy?

08:26.933 --> 08:27.967
Maybe.

08:28.067 --> 08:30.067
Picture him with a
bar stool in his hands

08:30.100 --> 08:32.200
and it's aimed
at your head.

08:32.233 --> 08:34.767
I wish that narrowed it
down more than it does.

08:34.800 --> 08:37.433
C'mon, we're smarter
than that and so are you.

08:37.467 --> 08:39.800
What were you two
fighting about?

08:43.067 --> 08:45.767
Oh man,

08:45.800 --> 08:47.600
I'm sorry.

08:47.633 --> 08:50.867
My memory's kinda shot.

08:50.900 --> 08:52.600
One too many bar
stools, I guess.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.900
Anything that might
improve that memory?

08:54.933 --> 08:57.067
Sunshine, you know
what I'm saying?

08:57.067 --> 08:59.067
Fresh air, a toilet
with a seat.

08:59.067 --> 09:01.100
I see you're being
transferred next week.

09:01.133 --> 09:02.933
Walla Walla, ouch.

09:02.967 --> 09:05.733
Too bad it's not Larch Mountain.
Real nice view there.

09:05.767 --> 09:08.433
Maybe you could call that
friend of yours in Operations,

09:08.467 --> 09:10.100
see if you can get
Wade transferred

09:10.133 --> 09:11.600
to Larch Mountain
instead?

09:11.633 --> 09:15.500
Yeah, iIf only I could
rememeber her name.

09:15.533 --> 09:18.433
Memory's kinda shot.

09:21.567 --> 09:23.733
His name's Vern Keeler.

09:23.767 --> 09:24.933
Smart guy.

09:24.967 --> 09:28.900
Smarter than I am,
since I'm in and he's not.

09:28.933 --> 09:30.767
He's a bad one,
I'll tell you.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.067
Nasty habits.

09:32.067 --> 09:33.067
Such as?

09:33.067 --> 09:37.133
Well, first pills.
Then robbery, then both.

09:37.167 --> 09:39.733
Harper Park, November 25th
two years ago.

09:39.767 --> 09:42.867
Vern tries to rob an
oxy dealer... that you?

09:42.900 --> 09:44.767
That why you two were
flinging bar stools

09:44.800 --> 09:46.067
in Seattle
three days later?

09:46.067 --> 09:48.700
What fool would be in
Harper Park at midnight?

09:48.733 --> 09:51.300
One with a lousy memory.

09:57.100 --> 10:00.033
I do remember one thing.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.967
I saw on the news
that a cop got shot.

10:04.433 --> 10:07.567
A pretty woman cop.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.000
And that's all I know.

10:11.967 --> 10:13.533
We're done here.

10:13.567 --> 10:15.067
Let's go.

10:16.067 --> 10:19.367
Oh, I just remembered my
friend's name in Operations.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.200
Guess my memory's not
as bad as I thought.

10:22.233 --> 10:25.933
Bye, Wade.
Enjoy Walla Walla.

10:25.967 --> 10:27.633
You gonna make me testify?

10:31.433 --> 10:33.167
It's got an ocean view.

10:33.200 --> 10:39.500
Fine, but I'll need six
months off this stint.

10:39.533 --> 10:42.367
I'll need a present
for the DA.

10:49.033 --> 10:51.733
Keeler was running with
this long-legged junkie girl.

10:51.767 --> 10:53.067
She might know something.

10:53.100 --> 10:54.667
Does the junkie
girl have a name?

10:54.700 --> 10:56.300
Cyndi.

10:56.333 --> 10:58.733
With the Y and I backwards,
know what I'm saying?

10:58.767 --> 11:00.367
Last name?

11:00.400 --> 11:02.233
She worked as a
massage therapist

11:02.267 --> 11:03.967
out of the
Imperial Cafe.

11:04.067 --> 11:07.067
Girls like that ain't
got no last names.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.400
But a line on a
girl like that...

11:09.433 --> 11:11.633
should earn a
brother a nice view.

11:11.667 --> 11:16.233
I'll let you know...
if we find her.

11:16.267 --> 11:17.933
He's all yours.

11:22.267 --> 11:24.467
Thanks for the hard work,
you guys.

11:24.500 --> 11:27.067
Mrs. Belmont is going to
love how well we cleaned up.

11:27.100 --> 11:29.067
She is very particular.

11:29.100 --> 11:31.400
Thanks for the chance
to earn some cash, Dad.

11:31.433 --> 11:33.367
No problem.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.500
My money wants to go
to the comic book store

11:35.533 --> 11:37.367
and look for the new
Justice League of America.

11:37.400 --> 11:40.233
Your money has good taste.
What about you?

11:41.900 --> 11:43.967
Console...
game console.

11:44.067 --> 11:46.500
Dude, we did not
earn that much.

11:46.533 --> 11:48.633
It all adds up.

12:05.533 --> 12:06.433
Share the drawer.

12:06.467 --> 12:07.833
What if things
get mixed up?

12:07.867 --> 12:09.767
I wouldn't be caught
dead wearing any of yours.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.067
Girls, just work it out,

12:11.067 --> 12:13.167
or talk to Dad or your
uncle, okay?

12:13.200 --> 12:15.467
Dad? It's the
underwear drawer!

12:15.500 --> 12:16.500
When are you
coming home?

12:16.533 --> 12:17.633
I don't know, okay?

12:17.667 --> 12:22.067
I gotta go.
Work it out, okay bye.

12:26.100 --> 12:27.167
Here's my partner now.

12:27.200 --> 12:30.067
Hi. Your gorgeous friend
here was just asking

12:30.067 --> 12:31.667
about our massage
therapists.

12:31.700 --> 12:33.067
You two want a couple's deal?

12:33.067 --> 12:35.333
Not that kind
of partner.

12:35.367 --> 12:38.100
Shelly, what can you tell
us about a therapist

12:38.133 --> 12:40.133
who worked out of here
a couple years back?

12:40.167 --> 12:43.500
Name's Cyndi.
Long legs, bad taste in men.

12:43.533 --> 12:46.400
Well that's half the girls
in here, so...

12:47.733 --> 12:50.967
She spelled it with the
Y and the I backwards.

12:52.967 --> 12:55.367
Oh, right! From
Minnesota,

12:55.400 --> 12:57.233
pretty smile and
yeah, long legs.

12:57.267 --> 12:58.200
She have a boyfriend?

12:58.233 --> 13:00.300
No, she had
an obsession.

13:00.333 --> 13:03.500
Did it look like this?

13:03.533 --> 13:06.633
Ugh, yeah that's him.
Major creep.

13:06.733 --> 13:07.667
True romance?

13:07.700 --> 13:10.500
No, it wasn't love,
it was oxy.

13:10.533 --> 13:13.167
That stuff gets hold of you
and makes you stupid crazy.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.267
Yeah, it does.

13:15.300 --> 13:16.567
You still in
touch with her?

13:16.600 --> 13:17.667
It's been a while.

13:17.700 --> 13:20.500
But this creep-o was here
last week, looking for her.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.500
What did you tell him?

13:21.533 --> 13:22.900
I told him Minnesota.

13:22.933 --> 13:24.067
I doubt she's there,

13:24.067 --> 13:26.300
and there's no way I'm letting
him drag her back down.

13:26.333 --> 13:28.167
You got any contact
information on her?

13:28.200 --> 13:29.167
Phone number? Email?

13:29.200 --> 13:31.500
I wish I did.
She cut us all off.

13:31.533 --> 13:34.067
They say people
don't change, but she did.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.567
Cleaned up, even met a sweet
guy on Christian Mingle,

13:36.600 --> 13:37.933
if you can believe it.

13:37.967 --> 13:40.733
A happy ending,
there's a twist.

13:40.767 --> 13:42.167
I understand you
want to protect her,

13:42.200 --> 13:43.600
but we really need
to find her.

13:43.633 --> 13:45.233
Is she in trouble?

13:45.267 --> 13:48.067
Not with us... with him.

13:49.167 --> 13:51.800
Hold on.

13:51.833 --> 13:55.967
She always said she wanted a
house with a beautiful garden.

13:56.067 --> 13:59.800
And this came
last Christmas.

13:59.833 --> 14:03.600
It's the last I heard from
her since she took off.

14:03.633 --> 14:05.900
Sometimes dreams
do come true.

14:05.933 --> 14:07.933
Oak Park postmark.

14:13.500 --> 14:16.267
Looks better than it
did on the internet.

14:18.267 --> 14:20.600
It looks even better
because Cyndi's home.

14:24.167 --> 14:25.500
Excuse me.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.067
Excuse me!

14:30.067 --> 14:33.967
Mrs. Martin?

14:36.800 --> 14:39.300
It took me three months to
get in to see this doctor.

14:39.333 --> 14:40.233
I can't be late.

14:40.267 --> 14:41.600
We just have a
few questions.

14:41.633 --> 14:43.333
We wanted to follow up
about Vernon Keeler.

14:43.367 --> 14:44.300
From the line up.

14:44.333 --> 14:45.667
I told you,
it wasn't him.

14:45.700 --> 14:48.133
We never told
you his name.

14:48.167 --> 14:49.700
So how do you
know him?

14:49.733 --> 14:51.800
I have no idea who
you're talking about.

14:51.833 --> 14:53.833
Then maybe you can
help us find Cyndi?

14:53.867 --> 14:55.400
Maybe she knows who
we're talking about?

14:55.433 --> 14:59.067
Shelly sends her best.

14:59.067 --> 15:00.067
Mr. Martin.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.200
Everything okay
out here?

15:01.233 --> 15:02.433
Crestview PD, sir.

15:02.467 --> 15:04.267
We have a few follow-up
questions for your wife.

15:04.300 --> 15:05.733
Did you charge
the crook yet?

15:05.767 --> 15:06.533
We're very close.

15:06.567 --> 15:07.967
I'm sorry I couldn't
be of more help.

15:08.067 --> 15:08.800
I have to go.

15:08.833 --> 15:10.433
The guy I picked
out, he did it.

15:10.467 --> 15:11.067
Charge him.

15:11.067 --> 15:12.133
Thank you very much, sir.

15:12.167 --> 15:14.400
We'll get in contact
with you shortly.

15:23.767 --> 15:27.133
Our only lead just
froze us out.

15:32.467 --> 15:35.133
Hey.

15:35.167 --> 15:36.600
Thought you guys
might be hungry.

15:36.633 --> 15:38.767
Thank you.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.700
For you, for the kids.

15:40.733 --> 15:42.467
Are you going to
remember to eat?

15:42.500 --> 15:43.467
Yes.

15:43.500 --> 15:46.333
I'll take this to
Pete and Victoria.

15:49.067 --> 15:50.367
How's it going?

15:50.400 --> 15:54.167
We are making progress,
chasing the clock.

15:54.200 --> 15:58.433
That was sweet of you
to bring us dinner.

15:58.467 --> 16:02.533
I'm fine, really.

16:02.567 --> 16:04.067
Okay.

16:04.067 --> 16:06.200
I'll get the burgers to the
kids before they're cold.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.600
Let you get
back to it.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.933
Okay.

16:09.967 --> 16:11.067
Love you.

16:11.067 --> 16:13.267
Love you, too.

16:16.267 --> 16:18.733
Lieutenant, do you have a
contact in Corrections who could

16:18.767 --> 16:21.733
be persuaded to transfer
Wade Tilson to Larch Mountain?

16:21.767 --> 16:24.067
Your imaginary friend in that
imaginary department

16:24.100 --> 16:25.067
didn't have much pull?

16:25.067 --> 16:27.700
You brought her up and
she got him talking.

16:27.733 --> 16:29.167
What testimony
will that buy?

16:29.200 --> 16:31.733
Only that Keelers
been rolling oxy dealers.

16:31.767 --> 16:32.733
Not that he was one.

16:32.767 --> 16:34.267
Tilson wants a
six month discount

16:34.300 --> 16:35.333
along with the transfer.

16:35.367 --> 16:36.933
Does he want a
feather bed too?

16:36.967 --> 16:39.533
And what about Mrs. Martin?
Is there a way to press her?

16:39.567 --> 16:40.533
I don't see how.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.400
If she admits to a
past with Keeler,

16:42.433 --> 16:44.200
her shiny new
life blows up.

16:44.233 --> 16:46.100
Did she say why
Keeler broke in?

16:46.133 --> 16:48.500
She won't even
acknowledge she knows him.

16:48.533 --> 16:50.933
Nothing out of the
canvass at Harper Park?

16:50.967 --> 16:52.900
Two years is an
eternity on the street.

16:52.933 --> 16:54.133
So where does
that leave us?

16:54.167 --> 16:56.267
Square one, with
six hours down.

16:56.300 --> 16:58.600
Actually, square minus one.

16:58.633 --> 16:59.667
Keeler asked for a lawyer.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.333
Called Lev Ginsley.

17:01.367 --> 17:02.967
What? That's not
gonna happen.

17:03.067 --> 17:04.400
Keeler's broke,
Ginsley'll pass.

17:04.433 --> 17:05.567
No, he won't.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.500
If he can get Keeler off,
he gets so much media play.

17:07.533 --> 17:10.300
If we make a deal with
Tilson, Ginsley will know.

17:10.333 --> 17:11.900
He always knows.

17:11.933 --> 17:13.233
He'll tear him apart.

17:13.267 --> 17:14.900
Tilson's testimony
will be useless.

17:14.933 --> 17:16.400
And even if the
wife was talking,

17:16.433 --> 17:19.667
Ginsley on cross with a former
junkie/hooker... toast.

17:19.700 --> 17:21.933
He's gonna walk.

17:23.933 --> 17:27.067
Let's take five
and re-group.

17:36.867 --> 17:39.067
You might not care about
getting in trouble with Matt,

17:39.100 --> 17:41.267
but I do.

17:43.100 --> 17:45.267
We will get this guy.

17:48.333 --> 17:50.933
Mrs. Martin?

17:57.600 --> 17:59.100
Thank you for coming in.

17:59.133 --> 18:01.067
We didn't expect
to see you again.

18:01.067 --> 18:04.333
It just wasn't the
right time, y'know?

18:04.367 --> 18:07.133
Is it okay if
it's just her?

18:07.167 --> 18:10.133
Not at all.

18:14.067 --> 18:17.667
Did you make it to your
doctor's appointment?

18:17.700 --> 18:19.667
We're trying to
have a baby.

18:19.700 --> 18:21.167
That's wonderful.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.167
How many kids
do you have?

18:24.200 --> 18:27.467
Two, but you're not here
to talk about me.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.300
Can we talk about Cyndi...

18:29.333 --> 18:32.067
and Vern Keeler?

18:32.067 --> 18:34.067
I can't believe
that he found me.

18:34.067 --> 18:37.933
When Terry and I came home and
Vern burst out of the kitchen

18:37.967 --> 18:39.300
and pushed right past --

18:39.333 --> 18:41.133
I thought my heart
was going to stop.

18:41.167 --> 18:43.133
I never wanted to
see him again.

18:43.167 --> 18:45.200
Is that why you
threw the line-up?

18:45.233 --> 18:48.500
I was hoping that
he'd just go away.

18:48.533 --> 18:52.433
That he'd know I helped him go
free and he'd just disappear

18:52.467 --> 18:55.600
again and leave
me alone.

18:55.633 --> 18:57.733
The best way to get
him out of your life

18:57.767 --> 18:59.067
is to keep him in jail.

18:59.067 --> 19:01.500
But I need your
help to do that.

19:01.533 --> 19:03.967
No, Terry can't know.

19:04.067 --> 19:07.567
Terry can't know that
Vern and I used to...

19:07.600 --> 19:09.767
he can't know who
I used to be.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.500
If he finds out,
I will lose him.

19:12.533 --> 19:13.567
Your husband loves you.

19:13.600 --> 19:14.967
You won't lose him.

19:15.067 --> 19:16.133
No.

19:16.167 --> 19:18.500
You don't understand.

19:18.533 --> 19:21.233
I've made mistakes.

19:21.267 --> 19:24.933
A lot of mistakes.

19:24.967 --> 19:27.633
Was Vern one of
those mistakes?

19:27.667 --> 19:30.300
He was one of
the biggest.

19:30.333 --> 19:32.267
Him and the oxy.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.100
Sixteen pills a day.

19:34.133 --> 19:37.067
He always had what
I needed, y'know?

19:39.367 --> 19:41.400
How long did you
and Vern date?

19:41.433 --> 19:42.633
We didn't date.

19:42.667 --> 19:45.633
We hung out
and got high.

19:45.667 --> 19:48.167
So were you hanging
out two years ago,

19:48.200 --> 19:49.867
around Thanksgiving?

19:51.700 --> 19:53.800
Yeah.

19:53.833 --> 19:56.600
Yeah, we got in a fight
because Shelly

19:56.633 --> 19:58.600
invited me over for
turkey, but not him.

19:58.633 --> 20:00.833
Did you ever go to
Harper Park together?

20:00.867 --> 20:02.433
All the time.

20:02.467 --> 20:06.900
Did you know a police officer
was shot there that November?

20:06.933 --> 20:07.767
No.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.600
Vern didn't say
anything about that?

20:10.633 --> 20:12.367
No.

20:13.833 --> 20:18.833
The bullet cut right through
to the back of her lung.

20:18.867 --> 20:23.733
She has a husband who loves
her, like Terry loves you.

20:23.767 --> 20:26.933
And two beautiful children.

20:30.867 --> 20:33.833
They almost lost her.

20:36.833 --> 20:39.300
You know who shot her?

20:39.333 --> 20:43.800
Vern Keeler.

20:43.833 --> 20:46.767
Vern shot you?

20:52.033 --> 20:57.333
We all have something from
our past we want to forget.

20:57.367 --> 20:59.667
Something that haunts us.

20:59.700 --> 21:05.967
So you and I have
the same ghost.

21:06.067 --> 21:08.200
You know, you're
gonna have that baby.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.433
A family.

21:10.467 --> 21:14.467
You don't want that
ghost haunting them too.

21:14.500 --> 21:17.767
So let's get rid of it.

21:30.967 --> 21:33.100
I thought you were
cleaning your closet.

21:33.133 --> 21:34.767
We finished.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.133
Mostly.

21:36.167 --> 21:38.067
It's for Aunt Allison.
Not you.

21:38.067 --> 21:39.400
She's having a bad day.

21:39.433 --> 21:40.933
So we're making her favorite.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.067
Hummingbird cake.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.100
I have bad days.

21:43.133 --> 21:44.733
How come no one
bakes me a cake?

21:44.767 --> 21:46.800
Maybe if you weren't
such a jerk all the time.

21:46.833 --> 21:48.067
Mom tell you
what's going on?

21:48.067 --> 21:49.933
No, that's how I
know it's bad.

21:49.967 --> 21:52.100
And a cake's gonna
make it all better?

21:52.133 --> 21:53.767
Hey, what's your problem?

21:53.800 --> 21:55.867
Wow, I really wish
somebody told me

21:55.900 --> 21:57.500
about the magical
powers of cake.

21:57.533 --> 21:59.500
Maybe then our mom
wouldn't be in rehab.

21:59.533 --> 22:00.800
Shut up!

22:00.833 --> 22:03.200
Did you make a cake for your
mom the day she arrested my dad?

22:03.233 --> 22:04.900
Or was that a
good day for her?

22:04.933 --> 22:06.700
Cameron... stop!

22:06.733 --> 22:11.867
Cameron, I need to talk
to you for a second.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.733
$50 was stolen
from Mrs. Belmont's house.

22:25.767 --> 22:28.767
If you're asking if I saw
Jeff with it, I didn't.

22:28.800 --> 22:30.933
Cameron, the money was
taken from the kitchen.

22:30.967 --> 22:32.767
You're the one that
was cleaning in there.

22:32.800 --> 22:33.767
Did you take it?

22:33.800 --> 22:34.767
No.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.400
Look me in the eye
and say that.

22:36.433 --> 22:37.433
I didn't take it!

22:37.467 --> 22:39.167
But of course
you think I did.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.767
Add it to the list of reasons
you don't want me around.

22:41.800 --> 22:44.333
Mariah and I never bought
into this thing anyway.

22:44.367 --> 22:48.167
We know you're looking for
an excuse to get rid of us.

23:01.233 --> 23:03.733
Stealing? How could
you be so stupid?

23:03.767 --> 23:06.967
You want to live in
some random foster home

23:07.067 --> 23:08.067
with people you
don't know?

23:08.100 --> 23:09.333
I wanna stay at home.

23:09.367 --> 23:10.333
This is our home.

23:10.367 --> 23:13.267
It's the best one
we're ever going to have.

23:14.867 --> 23:16.300
Fix this.

23:16.333 --> 23:19.400
So you think
I'm guilty too?

23:19.433 --> 23:23.400
I know you, Cameron.

23:31.067 --> 23:33.067
Vern was bashed
up pretty bad.

23:33.067 --> 23:36.467
Eyes were all black,
he was scared.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.300
I'd never seen
him like that.

23:38.333 --> 23:39.867
Did he say who
beat him up?

23:39.900 --> 23:44.133
No, just that he
had to leave town.

23:44.167 --> 23:46.533
Did you know Vern
was robbing dealers?

23:46.567 --> 23:49.433
I never saw him do it,
but he didn't have a job.

23:49.467 --> 23:50.967
He was always holding.

23:51.067 --> 23:52.267
The night he
was bashed up...

23:52.300 --> 23:53.967
that was the last
time you saw Vern?

23:54.067 --> 23:55.100
Yeah.

23:55.133 --> 23:58.733
Until Terry and I walked in
on him ransacking our house.

23:58.767 --> 24:01.400
Tell me what he
was looking for.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.067
Carla...

24:08.833 --> 24:12.933
Before he disappeared,
right after he shot you,

24:12.967 --> 24:14.533
he gave me a bag.

24:14.567 --> 24:17.433
He said he would be
back and he wanted me

24:17.467 --> 24:19.300
to hold on to
it for a while.

24:19.333 --> 24:20.833
What was in the bag?

24:20.867 --> 24:23.433
About $10,000.

24:23.467 --> 24:27.100
And... a gun.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.933
Probably the one
that he shot you with.

24:29.967 --> 24:31.933
He said he painted
stars on the handle

24:31.967 --> 24:33.367
for every dealer
he rolled.

24:33.400 --> 24:34.767
Do you still have it?

24:34.800 --> 24:39.167
Not the money,
rehab's not cheap.

24:39.200 --> 24:42.367
But I hid it where
I knew no one would look.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.200
Will you take me to it?

24:44.233 --> 24:47.933
If I do, does our
ghost go away?

24:47.967 --> 24:49.767
If you testify,
it's gone forever.

24:49.800 --> 24:50.800
No!

24:50.833 --> 24:54.067
I cannot testify, Terry
will know everything.

24:54.067 --> 24:56.867
I'm sorry.

24:56.900 --> 24:59.167
Okay, if you just...

24:59.200 --> 25:01.167
if you just take
me to the gun,

25:01.200 --> 25:04.333
I won't ask for
anything else.

25:14.100 --> 25:16.067
I wish you'd told me.

25:16.067 --> 25:17.800
I was afraid he'd
come after you.

25:17.833 --> 25:19.900
And I wanted you to
be able to tell him

25:19.933 --> 25:21.567
you didn't
know anything.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.067
Hang on, I got
something...

25:23.067 --> 25:24.833
The gun?

25:26.433 --> 25:28.800
That's it.

25:32.600 --> 25:35.433
It's empty.

25:42.067 --> 25:45.833
Just one more day,
we're close.

25:45.867 --> 25:48.100
Let me call you
right back.

25:48.133 --> 25:49.967
The DA,
sanctimonious jerk.

25:50.067 --> 25:51.567
Tell me you got the gun.

25:51.600 --> 25:54.400
It wasn't there,
someone took it.

25:54.433 --> 25:56.067
It's time to put
Keeler in the box.

25:56.067 --> 25:57.500
Give me five minutes
with him --

25:57.533 --> 26:00.067
You mean give Victoria and
Pete five minutes with him.

26:00.067 --> 26:01.300
But I'm the one that's --

26:01.333 --> 26:02.500
Personally involved.

26:02.533 --> 26:04.467
I don't need to remind
you of procedure,

26:04.500 --> 26:05.633
do I, McLean?

26:05.667 --> 26:06.833
No, ma'am.

26:06.867 --> 26:09.067
Victoria and Pete will
do a fine job with him.

26:09.100 --> 26:12.600
I'll just have them
bring Keeler to room two.

26:14.867 --> 26:16.367
I'm at this
special pharmacy.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.867
The doctor wants me to
start on Clomid right away.

26:18.900 --> 26:21.700
But the only one that
has it is in Edmonds.

26:21.733 --> 26:24.300
No, don't wait up
sweetheart.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.933
I'll be home soon.

26:29.933 --> 26:31.667
Detective McLean
will be right back.

26:31.700 --> 26:33.300
Let's get you a coffee.

26:33.333 --> 26:35.767
I just lied to my
husband again.

26:35.800 --> 26:38.200
I promised myself that
I would never do that.

26:38.233 --> 26:39.267
I need to go.

26:39.300 --> 26:41.300
Your friend shot
my partner.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.200
He's not my friend,
I need to go.

26:43.233 --> 26:46.100
If you go right
now, he walks too.

26:46.133 --> 26:47.367
What if he has his gun?

26:47.400 --> 26:48.567
Get out of my way.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.600
What if the next person
he shoots is your husband?

26:51.633 --> 26:53.600
I can't help you anymore.

26:53.633 --> 26:55.933
Just a few more questions
so we can wrap this up.

26:55.967 --> 26:57.067
Without my lawyer?

26:57.067 --> 26:58.200
He's not coming tonight.

26:58.233 --> 27:00.267
You got stuff to hide,
you want to wait?

27:00.300 --> 27:02.300
That's your call.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.200
Take him in.

27:21.067 --> 27:22.200
What's going on here?

27:22.233 --> 27:24.133
Keeler just saw his
ex-girlfriend talking to me.

27:24.167 --> 27:26.600
And then he saw Allison,
the cop he shot.

27:26.633 --> 27:29.500
So you need to go in there
and help him put it together.

27:29.533 --> 27:31.167
That Carla gave
us everything:

27:31.200 --> 27:33.267
the money, drugs,
and the gun.

27:33.300 --> 27:34.433
Push him to a plea.

27:34.467 --> 27:38.367
Oh yeah,
we'll enjoy this.

27:44.433 --> 27:47.833
We want to give you a chance
to consider some options.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.200
As far as we're concerned,

27:49.233 --> 27:52.267
there are no good guys or
bad guys in this room.

27:52.300 --> 27:55.067
Do you know
why you're here?

27:55.067 --> 27:57.867
Cosmically or
specifically?

27:57.900 --> 27:59.333
Specifically.

27:59.367 --> 28:00.500
That's too bad...

28:00.533 --> 28:03.267
the other answers
were much better.

28:03.300 --> 28:05.233
Let's start with why
you broke into

28:05.267 --> 28:06.667
101 Martel Ave.
last night?

28:06.700 --> 28:09.767
Broke in?
Is that what she told you?

28:09.800 --> 28:12.233
We came home to
find an unknown man

28:12.267 --> 28:14.133
searching through our
cupboards and drawers.

28:14.167 --> 28:16.900
That's what
Mr. Martin told you.

28:16.933 --> 28:19.567
I am certainly not
unknown to Mrs. Martin.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.300
She just couldn't
tell you that

28:21.333 --> 28:23.467
in front of her
pretty new husband.

28:23.500 --> 28:27.733
She and I, we had a
pretty intense thing.

28:27.767 --> 28:30.667
It's hard to let go of
something like that.

28:30.700 --> 28:33.633
Even after you
marry someone else.

28:33.667 --> 28:36.200
You know what I mean?

28:36.233 --> 28:37.633
You, maybe not so much.

28:37.667 --> 28:40.200
But you, definitely.

28:40.233 --> 28:41.567
Where's he going
with this?

28:41.600 --> 28:43.667
He's going to make a story
about how they reconnected,

28:43.700 --> 28:45.667
then she felt guilty,
refused to see him,

28:45.700 --> 28:48.467
so he had to break in to get
something he left behind.

28:48.500 --> 28:49.633
And there's his
misdemeanor.

28:49.667 --> 28:52.067
Built on a lie.

28:52.100 --> 28:54.967
So you were sleeping
with Carla Martin?

28:55.067 --> 28:56.333
You mean Cyndi.

28:56.367 --> 28:59.567
We hadn't seen each
other for quite some time.

28:59.600 --> 29:02.067
But then we bumped
into each other,

29:02.067 --> 29:03.700
spark was still there,

29:03.733 --> 29:07.300
husband was out
of town...

29:07.333 --> 29:12.433
Anyway, I had this watch on
and afterwards, I forgot it.

29:12.467 --> 29:13.967
Good call.

29:14.067 --> 29:16.467
Too bad he just created a
fairly plausible alibi.

29:16.500 --> 29:20.267
And gave Ginsley his
foundation fo defense.

29:20.300 --> 29:23.367
He thinks he's
winning... that's okay.

29:23.400 --> 29:25.600
Let him swim a while
until he feels the hook.

29:25.633 --> 29:27.533
So you broke in to
get a watch?

29:27.567 --> 29:31.133
My watch... because she
wouldn't give it back.

29:31.167 --> 29:33.233
You can ask her,
I'm sure she'll deny it.

29:33.267 --> 29:35.600
She told us a lot,
Nothing about a watch.

29:35.633 --> 29:38.067
It sounds like you two
have a lot of history.

29:38.100 --> 29:40.100
She mentioned a gun,
some money...

29:40.133 --> 29:42.300
You sure that's not
what you broke in to find?

29:42.333 --> 29:43.067
Slow down.

29:43.067 --> 29:44.433
Easy.

29:44.467 --> 29:45.800
Their interview,
their style.

29:45.833 --> 29:47.933
What do you expect
from a drug addict?

29:47.967 --> 29:50.400
When we were together,
that girl was so paranoid,

29:50.433 --> 29:53.367
she thought the lady at the
Fluff 'n' Fold had a .45.

29:53.400 --> 29:54.600
That's why I left town.

29:54.633 --> 29:56.567
Wade Tilson said you
left town because

29:56.600 --> 29:59.433
you shot a detective
in Harper Park.

29:59.467 --> 30:02.267
So yo ca surprise
Vern Keeler.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.967
Look, I beat the
crap outta that guy.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.267
He'd say anything to
throw me under the bus.

30:07.300 --> 30:09.067
If anyone shot her,
it was him.

30:09.100 --> 30:10.100
Yes!

30:10.133 --> 30:12.967
He said her. How would he
know if he wasn't there?

30:13.000 --> 30:14.400
Take it home, Victoria.

30:14.433 --> 30:16.100
I've never even
been in that park.

30:16.133 --> 30:18.633
Carla says you went there
all the time to score oxy.

30:18.667 --> 30:21.300
Wade said the same thing except
he said stealing, not scoring.

30:21.333 --> 30:23.800
Is that what you were doing
the night you shot the cop?

30:23.833 --> 30:26.900
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

30:32.567 --> 30:33.600
That could be anyone.

30:33.633 --> 30:35.767
But it's not, it's you.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.333
And two minutes
later, you shot

30:37.367 --> 30:38.800
Detective Allison
McLean with that gun.

30:38.833 --> 30:40.800
The gun you gave Cyndi
to hold for you.

30:40.833 --> 30:43.467
Not my name! Not yet!

30:47.200 --> 30:49.700
When we run ballistics
on that gun and it matches

30:49.733 --> 30:51.767
the slug they pulled
out of the detective,

30:51.800 --> 30:52.667
you're done.

30:52.700 --> 30:54.867
Judges don't like
guys who shoot cops.

30:54.900 --> 30:57.767
We got Cyndi, we got Wade,
we got the gun.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.867
The only play you
got is a confession.

30:59.900 --> 31:02.767
You're smart, you've
stayed out this long.

31:02.800 --> 31:06.233
But you're not
staying out this time.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.833
Write it out, just
like you want to say it.

31:10.867 --> 31:14.233
We'll work with the DA and
you'll plead out at twenty.

31:23.867 --> 31:25.433
That's what you've got.

31:25.467 --> 31:27.400
That's why you're
pushing so hard.

31:27.433 --> 31:33.900
Because without a
confession, you got nothing.

31:33.933 --> 31:36.067
This was fun.

31:36.067 --> 31:39.800
Now are you escorting me
out, or should I instruct

31:39.833 --> 31:42.667
my lawyer to file an unlawful
detainment suit?

31:44.667 --> 31:48.267
Take him back to holding.

31:48.300 --> 31:50.300
Holding? Was it
something I said?

31:50.333 --> 31:52.667
Shut up.

31:57.300 --> 32:01.700
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

32:04.300 --> 32:05.967
Ginsley took Keeler's case.

32:06.067 --> 32:09.200
He's all over the DA, we
can't hold Keeler any longer.

32:09.233 --> 32:10.967
I'm sorry.

32:11.667 --> 32:13.300
He almost killed me.

32:13.333 --> 32:14.633
We need a tail on him.

32:14.667 --> 32:15.633
Already done.

32:15.667 --> 32:17.400
But there are still
leads that we...

32:17.433 --> 32:22.467
Go home.
Wle'll talk tomorrow.

32:22.500 --> 32:25.267
I'm sorry Allison.

32:39.833 --> 32:40.867
Cameron?

32:40.900 --> 32:43.167
Yeah?

32:43.200 --> 32:45.167
Where've you been?

32:45.200 --> 32:49.067
Uh... I was running.

32:49.067 --> 32:50.867
I told Mariah that
Coach Crandall

32:50.900 --> 32:54.500
put me on a new
training program.

32:54.533 --> 32:56.300
Mrs. Belmont called.

32:56.333 --> 32:58.700
Great, what now?

32:58.733 --> 33:00.067
She found her money.

33:00.067 --> 33:01.600
Told you I didn't take it.

33:01.633 --> 33:02.700
You did, I'm sorry.

33:02.733 --> 33:05.533
It's just strange that she
found it on her side porch,

33:05.567 --> 33:08.567
when she was sure she
left in the kitchen.

33:08.600 --> 33:11.267
People make mistakes
all the time.

33:13.200 --> 33:16.900
I'm gonna go
do my sprints.

33:16.933 --> 33:18.567
Can you tell
what's going on?

33:18.600 --> 33:20.167
Who knows.

33:20.200 --> 33:23.467
I'm done.

33:24.467 --> 33:26.800
I never know what's
going on with him or Mariah.

33:26.833 --> 33:31.067
Well there's plenty of drama
so, whatever you choose.

33:32.533 --> 33:34.667
Hello.

33:34.700 --> 33:37.333
Mom's home and
we're not done!

33:38.467 --> 33:40.167
Hey!

33:41.767 --> 33:43.433
Where's Cameron going?

33:43.467 --> 33:45.600
Went for a sprint.

33:46.600 --> 33:48.600
How'd it go?

33:55.300 --> 33:58.500
Mom, you okay?

33:58.533 --> 34:00.733
Uh, yeah.
I just had a long day.

34:00.767 --> 34:02.200
I'll be fine.

34:02.233 --> 34:05.400
I'm just going to go change.

35:53.967 --> 35:56.633
Lieutenant?

36:00.700 --> 36:03.333
Thanks for
letting me know.

36:03.367 --> 36:05.167
What happened?

36:05.200 --> 36:07.233
He's gone, he got
away from our guys.

36:07.267 --> 36:08.900
He knows my name.

36:08.933 --> 36:11.100
Find Cameron, get the
kids into their bedrooms

36:11.133 --> 36:13.433
and stay there
until I get back.

36:16.967 --> 36:19.800
Hey gang, can I get everybody
upstairs right now please?

36:19.833 --> 36:20.733
Why?

36:20.767 --> 36:21.767
Right now!

36:21.800 --> 36:23.300
I need everybody upstairs!
Right now let's go!

36:23.333 --> 36:24.367
What's going on?

36:24.400 --> 36:25.600
Cameron, you too!

36:25.633 --> 36:26.967
I need everybody upstairs.

36:27.067 --> 36:29.167
There's some guy sitting
in his car out there.

36:29.200 --> 36:30.700
Jeff, right now!

36:30.733 --> 36:34.067
Alright, um... I'll let you
know when its clear, okay?

37:11.933 --> 37:13.767
Devin! I thought
you were Keeler.

37:13.800 --> 37:14.900
He slipped his tail.

37:14.933 --> 37:17.633
I know, that's why I
grabbed an undercover car.

37:17.667 --> 37:19.667
I'm standing watch.

37:21.167 --> 37:26.400
He's not coming here...
he's going to Carla's!

37:40.067 --> 37:40.167
Vern!

37:40.700 --> 37:42.333
Vern, please!

37:42.367 --> 37:43.900
You stole from me.

37:43.933 --> 37:45.900
Now we're gonna go
to the bank,

37:45.933 --> 37:47.567
you're gonna take
out all your money,

37:47.600 --> 37:49.567
you're gonna give it
to me, understand?

37:49.600 --> 37:50.833
No!

37:50.867 --> 37:52.100
What's going on?

37:54.967 --> 37:57.267
No! Terry!

37:59.133 --> 38:01.233
Police!

38:01.267 --> 38:02.567
Put the weapon
down, now!

38:02.600 --> 38:04.067
All we care
about is Carla.

38:04.067 --> 38:06.867
Stay back!

38:06.900 --> 38:11.067
Give me a reason to shoot
you Keeler, I'm ready.

38:12.500 --> 38:16.633
Stay with him,
i've got this.

38:16.667 --> 38:19.267
Put pressure on the wound,
do not move.

38:22.600 --> 38:23.433
You okay?

38:23.467 --> 38:25.067
Yeah.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.967
We have unfinished
business, Detective.

38:59.067 --> 39:00.467
Let's finish it.

39:14.633 --> 39:16.067
Allison!

39:16.067 --> 39:18.367
Allison, please!

39:18.400 --> 39:20.167
This isn't the way.

39:20.200 --> 39:25.667
This isn't the way,
all right?

39:25.700 --> 39:28.100
C'mon, get up, c'mon!

39:28.133 --> 39:31.433
Get down on your knees,
hands on your head!

39:31.467 --> 39:34.333
Do it!

39:51.133 --> 39:54.300
Good morning,
everybody's up early.

39:54.333 --> 39:56.800
Actually, you're up
a little late.

39:58.733 --> 40:00.500
It's a hummingbird cake.

40:00.533 --> 40:04.833
Where did that come from?
You guys made it?

40:04.867 --> 40:06.300
It's your favorite.

40:06.333 --> 40:08.633
We though you
could use some cake.

40:08.667 --> 40:11.600
I think we could all use
some cake, right now.

40:11.633 --> 40:12.933
Cake for breakfast?

40:12.967 --> 40:14.567
Absolutely.

40:14.600 --> 40:15.933
I'll grab some plates.

40:17.433 --> 40:18.900
I'll get it.

40:25.200 --> 40:28.100
Hey, come on in.

40:28.133 --> 40:30.900
We're having cake
for breakfast.

40:30.933 --> 40:34.567
Of course you are.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.033
I thought you'd
want to know,

40:36.067 --> 40:39.533
Terry Martin filed a missing
person's report last night.

40:39.567 --> 40:43.200
Carla took off.

40:43.233 --> 40:45.767
And Keeler doesn't
have his gun.

40:50.867 --> 40:53.667
There goes our case
against him as my shooter.

40:53.700 --> 40:56.400
Keeler's gonna do time for
what he did to the Martins.

40:56.433 --> 40:58.100
Two years, minimum.

40:58.133 --> 41:00.300
That gives us plenty of
time, with him locked away,

41:00.333 --> 41:02.267
to put together a tight
case against him

41:02.300 --> 41:04.067
for what he did to you.

41:04.067 --> 41:07.333
Hey! I'm not
giving up on this.

41:09.833 --> 41:12.067
Does Terry have any
idea where Carla went?

41:12.100 --> 41:13.633
He put together a list.

41:13.667 --> 41:15.400
Pete and Victoria
are working on it.

41:15.433 --> 41:18.200
Okay, that's good.

41:18.233 --> 41:20.833
I just don't
understand why she ran.

41:20.867 --> 41:22.700
I mean Terry's devastated.

41:22.733 --> 41:26.067
Says he'll go crazy
until he finds her.

41:26.067 --> 41:29.067
She doesn't think
he'll forgive her.

41:29.067 --> 41:32.500
She's... haunted.

41:37.767 --> 41:39.667
Come on, I want you
to have some cake.

41:39.700 --> 41:42.633
Thanks, but I've got
to go pick up Arielle.

41:42.667 --> 41:46.067
I just wanted to
check on you.

41:46.067 --> 41:49.067
Give that girl
a hug for me.

41:49.067 --> 41:52.067
Yeah.

41:54.833 --> 41:57.633
Hey, Devin.

41:57.667 --> 41:59.667
Thanks.

42:18.633 --> 42:20.100
Mom, have some cake.

42:24.733 --> 42:26.100
That looks really good.

42:26.133 --> 42:28.367
Look at the mess
you've already made.

42:28.400 --> 42:29.367
How is it?

42:29.400 --> 42:31.800
Oh it's really good.
