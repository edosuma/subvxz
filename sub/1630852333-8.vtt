00:10.635 --> 00:12.887
- Smells like betrayal in here.

00:12.929 --> 00:16.182
[tense music]

00:16.224 --> 00:18.727
- Okay, let me backtrack
for a second here.

00:18.768 --> 00:21.521
So we now think your father
is the Architect,

00:21.563 --> 00:23.023
and we're basing that
on information

00:23.064 --> 00:25.233
we got from one of your farts?

00:25.275 --> 00:27.819
- Looks like someone's
finally playing chess.

00:29.738 --> 00:33.116
Think about it.
Whoever smelt it, dealt it.

00:33.158 --> 00:37.078
From birth, that simple axiom
is drilled into our heads,

00:37.120 --> 00:38.913
and for good reason.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.790
It's never wrong.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.042
See, when one farts,

00:42.083 --> 00:44.252
they always blame it
on someone else,

00:44.294 --> 00:47.297
but studies show that
in 100% of the cases,

00:47.339 --> 00:50.091
that fart actually
came from inside of them,

00:50.133 --> 00:51.801
the initial fart detector.

00:51.843 --> 00:53.970
It's the most classic con
in the book,

00:54.012 --> 00:56.931
but if you somehow figure out
who smelt it,

00:56.973 --> 00:59.142
then you will, without fail...

01:02.145 --> 01:03.813
Find the dealer.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.316
- Right.

01:08.151 --> 01:11.237
- No entry my ass.

01:11.279 --> 01:13.281
Shit.
- Are you sure about this?

01:13.323 --> 01:16.826
- Vicki, people lie.
Buttholes don't.

01:16.868 --> 01:19.662
[yells]

01:23.625 --> 01:26.836
- See, the Architect had to be
someone with access to Queeth,

01:26.878 --> 01:29.547
ties to the military,
and a score to settle.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.675
So when my father
farted Kernst's name at me,

01:31.716 --> 01:32.884
it made sense.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.470
I mean, Kernst ticked
all the right boxes,

01:35.512 --> 01:38.973
but my father
overplayed his hand.

01:39.015 --> 01:40.642
He smelled it too hard,

01:40.684 --> 01:43.311
and that's how I knew
he dealt it.

This whole time, it was
right under my fucking schnozz.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.473
- I'm gonna hop
on your dad's computer

02:20.515 --> 02:22.559
and see if I can find anything
on this flash drive.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.229
- Heavens to Henry.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.939
He has counterfeit passports
and currency

02:27.981 --> 02:30.900
for, like,
every country in the world.

02:35.321 --> 02:36.823
- Oh, my God.

02:39.034 --> 02:41.286
Ecuador was just the beginning.

02:43.329 --> 02:44.748
- Haven't seen
these many pins

02:44.789 --> 02:47.459
since I read that book
about ATM machines.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.211
He's gonna hit, like,
everywhere.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.963
Why? Why is he doing this?

02:52.005 --> 02:55.091
- I don't know, Vick,
but we have to stop him.

04:12.168 --> 04:14.879
- Gruber, are you sure
you want to do this?

04:14.921 --> 04:16.548
- You mean,
am I sure I want to confront

04:16.589 --> 04:18.550
the man I've worshipped
my entire life

04:18.591 --> 04:19.968

Am I sure I want the love
of my life to watch me die

No, Vicki, I'm not sure,

a choice now, do I?

04:35.442 --> 04:36.985
But you do.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.571
- What? What do you mean?

This is my fight.

- Oh, MacGruber,
we're in this together.

04:43.742 --> 04:46.119
- No, I can't let
you two risk your lives

04:46.161 --> 04:48.246
because of my fucked up dad.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.914
This is a family affair.

- MacGruber, I can't believe
I'm saying this,

04:53.043 --> 04:56.504
but the three of us
are kind of like a family.

about it like that.

05:06.681 --> 05:09.392
That's really nice.

Hell, my family's
been broken so long,

I almost forgot what it's like
to have a real family.

05:17.984 --> 05:22.364
But because of you two,
I remember again.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.491
So thanks.

05:24.532 --> 05:27.786

I can't believe I'm saying.

05:31.289 --> 05:32.749
Bring it in.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.462

I assure you this place
is very modest.

Okay, now, let's split up.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.592
Vicki, you check out
the vineyard.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.553
Checkers, you start
in the antiquities hall,

14:10.141 --> 14:12.727
- Hey, remember earlier?

14:12.769 --> 14:17.273
When I said that thing
about your face burns?

14:19.275 --> 14:23.571
I lied. Totally noticeable.

14:23.613 --> 14:24.531
[balloon pops]

14:31.746 --> 14:33.164
Where's her gun?

14:40.505 --> 14:42.007
- How long have you been
planning all this?

14:42.048 --> 14:43.925
- Decades.

14:43.967 --> 14:48.263
Every beautiful detail laid out
like the gears on a clock.

14:48.304 --> 14:52.267
Tick-tock, tick-tock,
but it'll all be worth it

14:52.308 --> 14:55.687
when we bring in the New Year
with a big fucking bang.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.981
- So you're gonna kill
millions of people--

14:58.023 --> 14:59.482
- Billions.

14:59.524 --> 15:02.694
- Billions, and you're okay
with that?

15:02.736 --> 15:04.404
- It's an important cause.

15:04.446 --> 15:05.739
- So important
that you're willing

15:05.780 --> 15:07.699
to sacrifice your own son.

15:09.617 --> 15:12.704
- I was willing to sacrifice
your mother, wasn't I?

15:14.539 --> 15:16.082
- What?

15:16.124 --> 15:19.461
- Unfortunately, your mother
found out about my little plan,

15:19.502 --> 15:23.673
and she just would not
shut up about it.

15:23.715 --> 15:29.721
So she had to be dealt
with accordingly.

15:31.306 --> 15:34.601
- You killed Mom?

15:34.642 --> 15:38.146
- Oh, yeah,
and you watched me do it.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.525
But you were so young
at the time

15:42.567 --> 15:45.195
that somehow,
I was able to convince you

15:45.236 --> 15:48.323
that you didn't see
what you saw.

15:48.365 --> 15:50.992
I told you it was Queeth,
and your little brain

15:51.034 --> 15:53.620
ate that shit up
like a fucking pot roast.

15:53.661 --> 15:56.331
[smacks lips]

15:56.373 --> 16:01.211
You were such a dumb little kid
and so annoying.

16:02.587 --> 16:07.133
Heck, in a way,
you inspired this whole thing.

16:07.175 --> 16:08.510
The minute you were born

16:08.551 --> 16:12.389
just kind of put me
into a funk.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.559
Well, you've got
a lot of think about.

16:18.269 --> 16:20.522
And I do have
a button to press.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.982
So I guess I'll be on my way.

16:23.024 --> 16:27.696
- Like hell you will! Ahh!

16:27.737 --> 16:30.657
[screaming]

16:36.121 --> 16:38.039
Where'd you go, you coward!

16:38.081 --> 16:44.629
* *

16:44.671 --> 16:47.882
- It's a lot like baseball,
if you think about it.

16:47.924 --> 16:50.010
[yells]

16:50.051 --> 16:51.594
[laughs]

16:51.636 --> 16:54.222
Strike one.

16:54.264 --> 16:57.017
[yells]

16:57.058 --> 17:00.186
Strike two.

17:00.228 --> 17:01.730
[yells]

17:01.771 --> 17:04.065
- Ahh, motherfucker!

17:04.107 --> 17:07.235
- Base hit! Yeah!
The crowd goes wild.

17:07.277 --> 17:08.778
[imitates crowd yelling]

17:08.820 --> 17:11.489
Whoo!
[yells]

17:22.417 --> 17:25.337
[soft music box playing]

17:25.378 --> 17:32.510
* *

17:57.327 --> 17:58.787
- What's that song?

18:02.374 --> 18:03.917
- It's whatever
you want it to be.

18:11.383 --> 18:13.259
* MacGruber *

18:13.301 --> 18:17.555
* He's such a little lovey
and I'm proud to be his mommy *

18:17.597 --> 18:21.059
* MacGruber, he is
the best son ever *

18:21.101 --> 18:23.478
* And I love him to pieces *

18:23.520 --> 18:27.524
* MacGruber,
I'll never ever leave him *

18:27.565 --> 18:29.984
* MacGruber *

18:34.322 --> 18:37.283
[tense music]

18:37.325 --> 18:43.623
* *

18:43.665 --> 18:45.583
- Daddy?

18:47.794 --> 18:49.713
- Never cared much
for that song.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.013
Welcome to the nerve center,
MacGruber.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.056
- Love what you've done
with the place.

19:00.098 --> 19:03.309
Although, I think I might
change the wall color.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.729
Maybe put some big splotches
of red

19:05.770 --> 19:08.273
right behind
where your brain is.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.275
- [chuckles]

19:10.316 --> 19:12.152
Can you believe
this little panel here

19:12.193 --> 19:14.070
can cause so much destruction?

19:14.112 --> 19:17.866
Just one little press
of this button, and poof.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.659
Billions dead.

19:19.701 --> 19:22.037
- You can save your breath,
Dad.

19:22.078 --> 19:26.291
'Cause I will never ever join
your little evil plan.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.835
- No one's asking you to,
you fucking dode.

19:28.877 --> 19:30.045
- How dare you!

19:30.086 --> 19:32.630
- What do you say
we get this party started?

19:35.008 --> 19:36.801
- Countdown activated.

19:36.843 --> 19:42.640
* *

19:42.682 --> 19:46.603
- Just so you know,
I can throw my voice.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.396
So if you think you have
my location locked down,

19:48.438 --> 19:49.773
you're probably wrong,

19:49.814 --> 19:53.568
'cause you probably think
I'm standing right here...

19:55.153 --> 19:58.490
[in silly voice] But maybe
I'm standing over here.

20:00.325 --> 20:02.952
[in gruff voice]
Or maybe over here.

20:02.994 --> 20:04.788
[in high-pitched voice]
I could be standing over here.

20:04.829 --> 20:07.374
[balloon pops]

20:07.415 --> 20:09.501
[empty chamber clicking]

20:22.180 --> 20:29.062
* *

20:41.282 --> 20:43.576
- Okay, now I'm pissed.

20:45.328 --> 20:49.165
Fucked up my leg
and my new cargos.

20:49.207 --> 20:50.500
- Call it even?

20:50.542 --> 20:51.751
- You wish.

20:51.793 --> 20:54.170
You see, Lon was like
a brother to me.

20:54.212 --> 20:56.840
You killed my fucking family.

20:56.881 --> 21:00.176
After I kill you, I'm gonna
kill your fucking family.

21:00.218 --> 21:04.431
Then we're even.

21:04.472 --> 21:06.474
You just had
a little baby, right?

21:12.522 --> 21:14.065
- [groans]

21:14.107 --> 21:16.192
- You don't have to do this.

21:16.234 --> 21:17.986
- Oh, but I do.

21:18.028 --> 21:20.864
- You know that means
I have to kill you.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.366
- Now, now.

21:23.408 --> 21:24.701
You know what happens

21:24.743 --> 21:27.579
when little boys are rude
to their daddies.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.706
- What's that?

21:29.748 --> 21:30.749
[groans]

21:30.790 --> 21:33.084
- They get a time-out.

21:33.126 --> 21:36.212
- Fuck you, Dad! Ah!

21:36.254 --> 21:39.257
- Watch your language.

21:39.299 --> 21:46.097
* *

21:55.648 --> 22:01.154
- Oh, Vicki.
I think I found you.

22:01.196 --> 22:03.490
- [in silly voice]
Uh, no you didn't.

22:03.531 --> 22:07.660
- No, I think I did.

22:07.702 --> 22:09.496
Goodbye, Vicki.

22:09.537 --> 22:11.956
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

22:11.998 --> 22:18.963
* *

22:24.177 --> 22:25.887
- Told you I could
throw my voice.

22:25.929 --> 22:27.597
Now let me show you
how to throw yours.

22:36.564 --> 22:38.942
Eww!

22:38.983 --> 22:41.736
[balloon squeaking]
Eww.

22:43.321 --> 22:50.203
* *

23:00.964 --> 23:05.176
- Oh, you're on your feet.

23:05.218 --> 23:06.553
- Yeah.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.221
I thought it'd be
a better way to kill you.

23:08.263 --> 23:10.473
- How you gonna do that?

23:10.515 --> 23:12.809
- Well, actually I had
a pretty complicated plan.

23:12.851 --> 23:15.103
Lots of moves and countermoves,

23:15.145 --> 23:16.980
and I thought
why not just keep it simple

23:17.022 --> 23:20.608
and talk shit about that piece
of shit brother of yours?

23:20.650 --> 23:24.904
Get you so bent out of shape
that you start making mistakes.

23:24.946 --> 23:26.656
Use your own weapon
to cut your head off.

23:26.698 --> 23:28.575
- [chuckles]

23:28.616 --> 23:30.702
Yeah.
Like that would ever work.

23:30.744 --> 23:32.829
- I don't know,
you seem pretty dumb.

23:32.871 --> 23:35.874
- What?
- But Lon seemed even dumber.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.917
- Fuck you!
[yell]

23:40.378 --> 23:41.880
- Checksmate.

23:50.722 --> 23:52.223
Sorry about your pants.

23:53.725 --> 23:55.685
- Two minutes remaining.

23:55.727 --> 24:02.859
* *

24:10.825 --> 24:12.827
- I'll rip your
fucking throat out

24:12.869 --> 24:15.080
and shove it down your throat.

24:18.708 --> 24:22.879
- Can't do it, can you?
What a surprise.

24:22.921 --> 24:26.591
But then again, you and I
never were much alike.

24:26.633 --> 24:31.179
I was always a breast man.
You were way more into butts.

24:45.610 --> 24:47.779
I'm gonna give you
a choice, son.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.533
You can either die now,

24:51.574 --> 24:53.076
or I can let you live
just long enough

24:53.118 --> 24:55.328
to see the end of the world
as we know it.

24:55.370 --> 24:58.707
- Oh, you'd do that for me?
- Ah, you're family.

24:58.748 --> 25:00.166
- You wish.

25:00.208 --> 25:03.128
You have no idea
what a family is.

25:03.169 --> 25:06.548
- Aw, that hurts my feelings.
- Aww, I'm sorry.

25:06.589 --> 25:08.842
- Now, hopefully,
this hurts yours.

25:17.142 --> 25:20.103
- No!

25:20.145 --> 25:22.313
- Oh, Vicki. Hi.

25:22.355 --> 25:25.775
Did you get to see me
shoot MacGruber in the heart?

25:25.817 --> 25:28.903
- MacGruber! No, no, no.

25:28.945 --> 25:32.115
MacGruber. MacGruber!
MacGruber, can you hear me?

25:32.157 --> 25:33.950
Don't go towards the lights.
Stay in the dark.

25:33.992 --> 25:36.077
Whatever you do.
Just stay in the dark!

25:41.374 --> 25:44.294
[sentimental music]

25:44.336 --> 25:49.341
* *

25:49.382 --> 25:51.801
- Casey?

25:51.843 --> 25:55.472
- Do you feel it, MacGruber?

25:55.513 --> 25:57.015
- Oh, my God.

25:57.057 --> 26:00.143
It's like I have
a thousand penises,

26:00.185 --> 26:02.729
and they're all shooting
at the same time.

26:04.230 --> 26:07.150
- That's what it feels like
for women too.

26:07.192 --> 26:10.028
Like we have
a thousand penises.

26:11.196 --> 26:15.533
Now, come to me.
Come to the light.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.160
- But I can't leave Vicki.

26:17.202 --> 26:20.413
- That's not your choice
to make.

26:20.455 --> 26:23.708
When it's time, it's time.

26:27.003 --> 26:30.632
- Mommy, I'm coming home.

26:30.674 --> 26:37.764
* *

26:45.146 --> 26:49.317
- You killed him.
You killed your own son!

26:49.359 --> 26:52.320
- Well, as a parent, you can't
be afraid to discipline.

26:52.362 --> 26:56.032
- 60 seconds
to worldwide destruction.

26:56.074 --> 26:58.952
- You're a monster,

26:58.993 --> 27:02.247
and I am gonna tear you
a new butthole!

27:02.288 --> 27:04.416
- Isn't it a little soon
to be getting intimate

27:04.457 --> 27:06.334
with another guy?

27:06.376 --> 27:08.545
Let alone his dad?

27:08.586 --> 27:09.921
Kinky.

27:09.963 --> 27:11.047
- I wouldn't get intimate
with you

27:11.089 --> 27:14.217
for all the Jelly Bellies
in the world.

27:14.259 --> 27:15.885
- Your loss.

27:15.927 --> 27:18.138
- Go ahead. Shoot me.

27:18.179 --> 27:20.348
I would rather be dead
than live in a world

27:20.390 --> 27:22.017
without MacGruber.

27:22.058 --> 27:23.935
- Ah, the lady means business.

27:23.977 --> 27:26.563
- Oh, yeah, you bet I do,
because you just killed

27:26.604 --> 27:30.734
the greatest living man
to ever walk this earth.

27:30.775 --> 27:32.152
- If you're dumb enough
to believe that,

27:32.193 --> 27:34.904
then you two really
were meant for each other.

27:34.946 --> 27:36.823
- You could say that

27:36.865 --> 27:39.409
we were like two peas in a pod.

27:39.451 --> 27:41.286
Bangers and mash.

27:41.327 --> 27:44.581
Brooks & Dunn.
Jack and the Box.

27:44.622 --> 27:45.749
- Ten seconds.

27:45.790 --> 27:49.753
We were so locked
into a rhythm.

27:49.794 --> 27:51.087
- Seven.

27:51.129 --> 27:52.964
It was almost like we could

27:53.006 --> 27:57.010
read each other's minds.

27:57.052 --> 28:00.013
[dramatic music]

28:00.055 --> 28:03.767
* *

28:03.808 --> 28:05.894
[MacGruber yelling]

28:05.935 --> 28:12.817
- No!

28:27.832 --> 28:32.837
- Sequence terminated.

28:39.010 --> 28:41.471
- MacGruber, we did it.

28:41.513 --> 28:43.640
- [laughs]

28:43.682 --> 28:45.558
We sure did.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.560
- Where did you get
a rocket launcher?

28:47.602 --> 28:49.771
- I got it from my brother.

28:49.813 --> 28:52.399
- You have a brother?

28:52.440 --> 28:53.942
- He does now.

28:56.486 --> 28:59.406
[triumphant music]

28:59.447 --> 29:05.245
* *

29:06.746 --> 29:10.208
[laughter]

29:22.595 --> 29:26.683
- For distinguished service
to the country and the world,

29:26.725 --> 29:30.603
we salute Lieutenant Colonel
Dixon Piper,

29:30.645 --> 29:32.522
MacGruber,

29:32.564 --> 29:36.359
and Vicki St. Elmo
MacGruber Fasoose MacGruber.

29:36.401 --> 29:39.112
[applause]

29:39.154 --> 29:43.033
[victorious music]

29:43.074 --> 29:44.617
- [mouths word]

29:48.455 --> 29:49.873
Get in here.

29:49.914 --> 29:57.047
* *

30:03.094 --> 30:05.555
So then I shot
a rocket-propelled RPG

30:05.597 --> 30:08.600
straight through Vicki's legs
right into my dad's face,

30:08.641 --> 30:10.643
and it was just dad chunks
for days.

30:12.312 --> 30:13.938
- I think I'm gonna go
put her down.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.440
- But hurry back.

30:15.482 --> 30:17.567
I got a primo story about
rippin' a dude's nose off

30:17.609 --> 30:19.694
and then stabbin' him
through the brain.

30:19.736 --> 30:20.987
- Hey, wait a second.

30:21.029 --> 30:22.113
How the hell did you survive

30:22.155 --> 30:24.324
a gunshot point blank
in the chest?

30:24.366 --> 30:27.619
- That, my friend,
was all Vicki.

30:27.660 --> 30:30.288
- Wow. What is that?

30:30.330 --> 30:32.665
- That's a locket
with Vicki's pubic hair in it.

30:32.707 --> 30:34.751
- Huh?
- Yeah.

30:34.793 --> 30:36.753
- He literally dodged a bullet.

30:36.795 --> 30:38.338
- By the thinnest of hairs,

30:38.380 --> 30:40.382
but there are
some fake ones in there too.

30:40.423 --> 30:42.717
- Thanks.

30:42.759 --> 30:44.678
- Hey, Pipe, I'm gonna go grab
another Molson.

30:44.719 --> 30:46.513
You want one?
- You know it, Grubes.

30:46.554 --> 30:48.473
- You got it.

30:48.515 --> 30:50.892
- My locket has his pubic hair.
Wanna see?

30:50.934 --> 30:52.185
- Peekaboo.

30:52.227 --> 30:55.146
- Oh, my God. Mom.

30:55.188 --> 30:57.482
- Hello, MacGruber.

30:57.524 --> 31:00.110
Hey, know why Molson
is my favorite beer?

31:00.151 --> 31:01.444
- Why?

31:01.486 --> 31:03.780
- Because it has
the word "son" inside of it.

31:03.822 --> 31:06.491
- [laughs]
Oh, you.

31:06.533 --> 31:08.368
Well, then you'll love Vicki,

31:08.410 --> 31:11.746
because she also has
your son inside of her.

31:11.788 --> 31:13.498
I mean, not right now.

31:13.540 --> 31:16.793
- [laughs]
Oh, MacGruber.

31:16.835 --> 31:18.837
I've missed you so.

31:18.878 --> 31:20.422
- I've missed you so.

31:20.463 --> 31:23.258
But someday,
we'll be together again.

31:23.299 --> 31:26.302
- Not for a while,
because you're about to go

31:26.344 --> 31:29.472
on the most important mission
of your life.

31:29.514 --> 31:32.851
- What do you mean? What--

31:32.892 --> 31:35.770
Mom. Mom? Mom!

31:40.108 --> 31:41.443
- Ah, I love it,
especially when

31:41.484 --> 31:42.777
one little hair peeks out.

31:42.819 --> 31:44.279
It's like he's tickling me.

31:44.320 --> 31:45.905
- Ah, here you go, brother.
- Thanks, Grubes.

31:45.947 --> 31:46.990
- Hard lemonade, Vick?

31:47.032 --> 31:48.700
- Oh, no thanks.

31:48.742 --> 31:50.452
- I can't believe
what I'm hearing here.

31:50.493 --> 31:53.288
This one's usually loves
lemonade with vodka in it.

31:53.329 --> 31:56.833
What gives, Vick? Pussy.

31:56.875 --> 32:00.253
- What gives is,

32:00.295 --> 32:01.713
I'm pregnant.

32:03.256 --> 32:04.341
- Oh, my God.
- What?

32:04.382 --> 32:05.300
- Congratulations.
- What?

32:05.342 --> 32:07.886
- I can't--oh, my!

32:07.927 --> 32:09.304
- A little Gruber.

32:09.346 --> 32:11.473
[sentimental music]

32:11.514 --> 32:14.559

becomes the fatherer.
