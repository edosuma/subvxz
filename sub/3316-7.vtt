00:02.344 --> 00:06.445
I went to see <i>Lilies of</i>
<i>the Field</i> last night.

00:06.552 --> 00:07.759
I'm reading the book right now.

00:07.892 --> 00:10.921
Sidney Poitier's performance
was... fabulous.

00:11.065 --> 00:13.498
I'm right at the part where he's
starting to build the chapel.

00:13.599 --> 00:15.594
Oh, I won't ruin it for you, then.

00:17.678 --> 00:18.891
Good morning.

00:19.043 --> 00:20.880
Good morning, Sister.

00:29.546 --> 00:31.281
She's burning up.

00:35.327 --> 00:36.133
Oh!

00:36.286 --> 00:37.605
God!

00:38.222 --> 00:41.078
Grace? Grace?

00:42.438 --> 00:43.708
Should I call Dr. Arden?

00:43.814 --> 00:46.403
That butcher? He's the one
who did this to her.

00:46.513 --> 00:48.924
- Should I call an ambulance?
- She'll be dead

00:49.032 --> 00:50.329
before it gets here.

00:56.285 --> 00:57.946
I can't stop the bleeding.

00:58.819 --> 01:00.360
She's turning blue.

01:01.325 --> 01:02.731
I'm ready.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.734
She's not breathing.

01:20.704 --> 01:22.623
We almost lost you, Grace.

01:24.119 --> 01:26.077
You should have let me go.

02:46.419 --> 02:48.761
Doing a little afternoon
gardening, Doctor?

02:49.524 --> 02:52.316
Just repotting
this salvia divinorum.

02:52.459 --> 02:54.092
It's not thriving as it should,

02:54.200 --> 02:56.112
and I'm determined
to revive it.

02:56.228 --> 02:57.769
And I have every confidence...

02:58.414 --> 02:59.625
you will.

03:00.056 --> 03:02.829
I worry less for your plants
than I do for your patients.

03:02.940 --> 03:04.111
But... I mean,

03:04.223 --> 03:05.779
since you appear
to be all thumbs,

03:06.168 --> 03:08.126
surely one of them is green.

03:08.401 --> 03:11.439
- I beg your pardon?
- The French girl, Grace,

03:11.634 --> 03:14.278
she nearly died this
morning because of you.

03:14.737 --> 03:16.585
What... are you
talking about?

03:16.686 --> 03:18.474
The sterilization that
Sister Jude ordered--

03:18.565 --> 03:19.588
you botched it, Arthur.

03:19.684 --> 03:20.960
She's been hemorrhaging.

03:21.038 --> 03:22.181
Sterilization?

03:22.275 --> 03:23.952
The nurses have stabilized her
for now, but if she

03:24.055 --> 03:27.447
takes another turn, I might have
to send her to a real hospital.

03:27.556 --> 03:28.847
Or let her bleed out.

03:28.956 --> 03:32.831
Which I suppose is
the real... alternative.

03:32.939 --> 03:34.342
We can't really afford to
let the outside world

03:34.460 --> 03:36.246
get a look at your
handiwork, now, can we?

03:36.364 --> 03:38.855
I performed
no sterilization, Sister.

03:38.958 --> 03:39.902
Oh, Arthur,

03:39.997 --> 03:41.340
you're back to your old tricks.

03:41.438 --> 03:44.156
All of her girl parts
have been scooped out.

03:44.900 --> 03:46.115
I must say I don't care much

03:46.218 --> 03:48.866
for your insinuations,
or your tone.

03:49.153 --> 03:51.258
As the head of this
institution, I demand

03:51.365 --> 03:54.622
to be spoken to with at least
a modicum of respect!

03:54.890 --> 03:57.341
That's rich... Arthur.

03:58.635 --> 04:00.616
You really think
you're in charge?

04:04.516 --> 04:06.319
You touch me again...

04:07.513 --> 04:09.297
you will die.

04:16.697 --> 04:19.947
I hope this clarifies the
chain of command, Arthur.

04:54.015 --> 04:57.000
I warned you about
your dirty mouth.

04:57.402 --> 04:59.166
That wasn't to you, Sister.

04:59.276 --> 05:01.168
I was talking
to the voices in my head.

05:01.272 --> 05:03.195
They get real loud sometimes.

05:03.510 --> 05:06.177
Cursing won't help
silence anything.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.656
You're right, Sister.

05:08.753 --> 05:09.926
<i>So what's it gonna be,</i>

05:10.029 --> 05:11.840
<i>a life of pure shit or a legacy</i>

05:11.961 --> 05:14.437
<i>of a brave, heroic soldier?</i>

05:16.900 --> 05:18.277
You know, Sister...

05:19.113 --> 05:20.993
these slices look
a little uneven.

05:21.087 --> 05:23.630
What are you talking about, Miles?
They look fine.

05:24.453 --> 05:26.646
I think there's
something wrong with the slicer.

05:28.915 --> 05:30.824
Let me take a look at it.

05:31.871 --> 05:33.837
I'm real good with machines.

05:45.782 --> 05:47.103
<i>You know what you need to do!</i>

05:47.206 --> 05:48.627
<i>For once</i>
<i>in your miserable life...</i>

05:56.207 --> 05:59.272
We got the bleeding stopped,
but he's gonna need stitches--

05:59.459 --> 06:00.582
a lot of 'em.

06:00.715 --> 06:02.933
Oh, Sister Mary Eunice,
I'm so sorry!

06:03.108 --> 06:05.909
Sister Jude's gonna be
very angry with me!

06:10.973 --> 06:12.607
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

06:12.691 --> 06:13.920
It's a name.

06:14.020 --> 06:16.056
- Don't look like English.
- It's not.

06:16.324 --> 06:18.412
It's ancient Aramaic.

06:19.574 --> 06:22.266
Miles... that
name on the wall,

06:22.462 --> 06:23.507
how do you know it?

06:23.611 --> 06:24.757
Name?

06:25.518 --> 06:27.128
Is that what it is?

06:27.870 --> 06:29.025
I don't know.

06:29.220 --> 06:30.767
I can't even read it.

06:31.344 --> 06:32.641
Why would I write it?

06:33.213 --> 06:35.462
Did you summon her?

06:36.301 --> 06:37.830
Summon who?

06:38.623 --> 06:40.727
We should get him
stitched, Sister.

06:41.086 --> 06:42.079
Fine.

06:42.180 --> 06:43.616
Once that's accomplished,
put him in isolation.

06:43.727 --> 06:45.612
We don't reward this
kind of behavior.

06:46.453 --> 06:48.487
Have this wall
scrubbed at once!

06:49.640 --> 06:51.574
Careful not
to open them stitches.

06:51.698 --> 06:52.972
You all right, Miles?

06:58.345 --> 07:00.190
I don't want to be here no more.

07:00.289 --> 07:01.937
It's just for one night, Miles.

07:02.252 --> 07:04.496
I don't mean this room, Frank.

07:05.673 --> 07:07.640
I mean this world.

07:49.650 --> 07:50.998
Who are you?

07:51.385 --> 07:54.242
You know who I am, Miles--
you summoned me.

07:54.869 --> 07:56.109
I did?

07:56.432 --> 08:00.231
I'm here to help you,
if that's what you want.

08:05.135 --> 08:06.769
Help me.

08:14.358 --> 08:16.642
Shall I kiss you, Miles?

08:18.385 --> 08:20.371
Shall I kiss you...

08:21.701 --> 08:24.206
and make this all go away?

08:25.641 --> 08:27.116
Yes.

08:44.405 --> 08:45.979
Who's there?

08:46.091 --> 08:48.336
Who dares look upon Shachath?

08:48.448 --> 08:50.221
Show yourself.

09:10.788 --> 09:13.081
You did what you had to do;
now leave.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.575
What are you that
you can look upon me?

09:16.847 --> 09:18.823
I'm just a simple nun.

09:19.077 --> 09:21.137
A nun, perhaps...

09:21.625 --> 09:23.520
but not so simple.

09:23.634 --> 09:25.800
Something else resides in you.

09:25.909 --> 09:29.376
One like me-- but fallen.

09:29.990 --> 09:30.851
Cousin.

09:30.992 --> 09:32.828
I'm no cousin of yours.

09:33.399 --> 09:35.345
Now leave this place;
you're not wanted here.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.450
I was invited, unlike you.

09:37.555 --> 09:39.284
Do you know why you
seek me out, Cousin?

09:39.379 --> 09:40.418
I don't seek you out.

09:40.522 --> 09:42.526
But you do--
or some part of you.

09:42.629 --> 09:44.572
The part that used to be pure.

09:44.686 --> 09:48.397
The human girl you've
taken hostage sings to me.

09:51.290 --> 09:52.809
O, Heavenly Host,

09:53.110 --> 09:55.461
will you release me?

09:55.667 --> 09:58.189
Can you release me?

09:58.834 --> 10:01.820
Oh, shut up, you stupid sow!

10:06.581 --> 10:08.489
She likes it here.

10:11.733 --> 10:13.438
We like it.

10:15.496 --> 10:17.252
We have work left to do.

10:17.368 --> 10:18.919
So do I.

10:22.295 --> 10:23.766
We'll meet again.

10:43.770 --> 10:46.052
You're grievously ill, Grace.

10:46.180 --> 10:48.919
There's an infection
coursing through your body,

10:49.134 --> 10:52.405
probably caused
by a botched hysterectomy.

10:52.743 --> 10:54.063
I've been accused

10:54.177 --> 10:56.362
of having committed
this savagery.

10:56.624 --> 10:57.809
Both you and I

10:57.921 --> 10:59.373
know it's not the truth.

10:59.470 --> 11:01.308
At this stage, it would

11:01.420 --> 11:03.614
be easier just to let you die,

11:03.725 --> 11:07.389
but I will not be the one
to take the fall for this.

11:07.707 --> 11:11.348
You will require
a strict regimen

11:11.448 --> 11:14.327
of medicines and
round-the-clock care.

11:14.941 --> 11:17.215
But you will live, Grace.

11:19.610 --> 11:22.200
If only
to set the record straight.

11:56.321 --> 11:58.046
Yeah. Yeah.

12:23.783 --> 12:24.992
It's all right.

12:27.170 --> 12:28.152
Everything accurate

12:28.258 --> 12:30.365
as, uh, far as
you can remember?

12:30.728 --> 12:33.003
Yeah, I-I said these things,
but I didn't confess.

12:33.096 --> 12:34.582
It was a headshrinker trick.

12:34.944 --> 12:38.353
Kit, they're going
to play the tape for the jury,

12:38.463 --> 12:40.956
and if I hear what
this says you said...

12:41.266 --> 12:43.083
...I convict.

12:43.462 --> 12:45.292
Did you talk to Grace,
like I told you?

12:45.397 --> 12:47.144
I mean, she can testify
that she just saw Alma.

12:47.244 --> 12:50.549
My wife is not dead,
and it proves I didn't do it.

12:50.714 --> 12:52.136
First of all,

12:52.239 --> 12:55.146
she's a patient
in a mental institution,

12:55.277 --> 12:58.873
so what she saw is not likely
to convince a lot of people.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.154
Second, they tell me
she's real sick.

13:01.413 --> 13:03.963
She might not even
make it to the hearing.

13:04.262 --> 13:06.920
The one way I saw
for you to avoid

13:07.035 --> 13:08.635
the electric chair--

13:08.731 --> 13:10.132
Dr. Thredson took away.

13:10.241 --> 13:11.882
Now, that doesn't mean

13:12.000 --> 13:14.001
that you can't change his mind.

13:14.257 --> 13:17.686
Now,
I'm not telling you to lie,

13:17.799 --> 13:20.503
but, uh, if you
started to act up...

13:21.382 --> 13:22.558
maybe we could

13:22.708 --> 13:26.656
build a defense to get
12 people to, uh,

13:26.804 --> 13:29.130
be convinced that, uh...

13:29.274 --> 13:30.748
that you can't tell
the difference

13:30.864 --> 13:33.112
between, uh, right and wrong.

13:56.647 --> 13:58.866
You heard me calling?

14:04.452 --> 14:05.311
I don't think

14:05.440 --> 14:07.434
I can do this anymore.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.153
Death would be better.

14:21.523 --> 14:23.652
I used to be scared of it.

14:25.974 --> 14:28.319
But I'm not afraid anymore.

14:28.452 --> 14:30.177
Just let go.

14:30.762 --> 14:33.163
I'm right here with you.

14:44.223 --> 14:45.665
No.

14:46.983 --> 14:48.449
Not yet.

14:54.556 --> 14:55.632
Lana?

14:56.143 --> 14:57.250
Are you decent?

15:05.346 --> 15:07.594
I think we need to have
a little talk, don't you?

15:08.492 --> 15:09.516
If that's what you want.

15:09.626 --> 15:10.935
It is.

15:13.049 --> 15:14.876
First of all, I want you to know

15:15.629 --> 15:17.053
that I'm not angry.

15:17.286 --> 15:18.675
What happened before was wrong.

15:18.771 --> 15:20.303
It was very wrong,
and I don't blame you.

15:20.404 --> 15:21.960
It was my fault.
Truth is, I probably

15:22.054 --> 15:24.029
shouldn't have brought you
here in the first place.

15:25.121 --> 15:26.549
- What do you mean?
- If there's one thing

15:26.682 --> 15:28.465
you should know about me, Lana,
it's that I'm tenacious.

15:28.571 --> 15:30.244
I don't like to give up.
That kind of

15:30.403 --> 15:33.336
stick-to-itiveness has served
me and my patients very well,

15:33.453 --> 15:36.085
but sometimes it also
prevents me from acknowledging

15:36.207 --> 15:37.714
when I have reached an impasse
like the one

15:37.799 --> 15:39.281
I think we've reached here.

15:40.688 --> 15:42.089
An impasse?

15:45.184 --> 15:47.667
Don't look so frightened, okay?

15:47.806 --> 15:49.180
I don't want to hurt you.

15:49.293 --> 15:51.433
I want this to be as painless
for you as possible,

15:51.580 --> 15:54.028
so I will give you a choice...
I can either cut your throat,

15:54.179 --> 15:55.703
or I can strangle you.

15:55.806 --> 15:57.566
I don't believe in guns.

15:58.263 --> 16:00.009
Oh, God.

16:00.122 --> 16:01.721
Christ, what am I saying?

16:02.784 --> 16:04.854
It doesn't matter how we do it.

16:09.108 --> 16:10.458
We'll put you out.

16:10.717 --> 16:12.706
- Please, no.
- You won't feel a thing.

16:12.990 --> 16:14.646
Please, no. No, no.

16:14.763 --> 16:15.962
Please, please.
No, no, no. No!

16:16.085 --> 16:18.518
- Please!
- Stop it! Stop...

16:18.670 --> 16:20.281
fighting.

16:20.812 --> 16:22.158
Stop fighting!

16:22.280 --> 16:24.250
- No!
- In no time at all,

16:24.345 --> 16:26.054
you'll be reunited with Wendy.

16:26.141 --> 16:27.548
You remember Wendy?

16:28.300 --> 16:29.327
Don't you?

17:58.441 --> 17:59.597
Drive. Go, please.

17:59.706 --> 18:01.355
Please, drive away. Please!

18:09.327 --> 18:10.755
Thank you.

18:11.161 --> 18:12.813
You saved my life.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.204
You didn't give me much
of a choice.

18:15.318 --> 18:16.919
You jumped in the car.

18:17.870 --> 18:19.119
I'm sorry.

18:19.310 --> 18:20.994
I had to get away from him.

18:21.627 --> 18:23.522
Did you have a fight
with your boyfriend?

18:24.464 --> 18:25.742
What did you do to him?

18:29.360 --> 18:30.659
Nothing.

18:30.806 --> 18:33.128
What makes you think
it was my fault?

18:33.416 --> 18:35.447
He almost killed me.

18:35.574 --> 18:37.779
- And he's not my boyfriend.
- Yeah?

18:37.994 --> 18:39.569
Of course it wasn't your fault.

18:39.673 --> 18:41.381
Women are always the victims.

18:46.414 --> 18:48.542
Could you please
just take me to the police?

18:48.657 --> 18:49.578
Oh, is that how it works?

18:49.685 --> 18:52.694
You get into my car, and then
you tell me what to do?

18:52.808 --> 18:55.340
- Please stop the car and let me get out.
- That's right.

18:55.458 --> 18:57.507
That's what you bitches do.
You get out.

18:57.648 --> 18:59.638
You leave; you abandon ship

18:59.749 --> 19:02.031
at the smallest
sign of a storm.

19:02.328 --> 19:03.793
What... What
are you going to do?

19:03.893 --> 19:06.849
You gonna get out of a car
going 50 miles an hour?

19:06.959 --> 19:08.515
Be my guest! Go!

19:09.865 --> 19:11.455
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Why did she take

19:11.591 --> 19:14.086
ten years of marriage and
flush it down the toilet?

19:14.203 --> 19:15.801
Why did I catch another man

19:15.966 --> 19:18.450
screwing my wife in my own bed?

19:18.564 --> 19:19.948
I didn't do anything to you.

19:20.151 --> 19:22.065
You brought this on yourself.

19:33.642 --> 19:35.160
No.

19:36.006 --> 19:37.705
Not you.

19:37.883 --> 19:39.734
Not after everything.

19:40.342 --> 19:41.983
I can't take it anymore.

19:42.101 --> 19:44.427
The lies, the betrayal,
the cheating--

19:45.720 --> 19:47.289
it's all going to end.

20:17.992 --> 20:19.867
Try not to move.

20:20.069 --> 20:22.311
You'll be in terrible pain.

20:22.858 --> 20:25.214
You've had quite the adventure.

20:25.338 --> 20:26.486
The police said
the car accident

20:26.594 --> 20:29.565
was horrific-- I'm afraid
it was fatal for the driver.

20:29.693 --> 20:31.418
But you're safe now.

20:31.617 --> 20:35.344
Back to Briarcliff,
where you belong.

20:50.586 --> 20:51.760
<i>Oh, God.</i>

20:51.974 --> 20:53.712
Oh, no.

20:53.840 --> 20:56.081
Oh, no, no...!

20:57.349 --> 20:58.344
Oh, God.

20:59.381 --> 21:01.348
- I'll call an ambulance.
- No.

21:01.488 --> 21:02.802
Listen, listen.

21:03.020 --> 21:04.454
- What?
- Listen, listen.

21:04.574 --> 21:05.526
Arden did this.

21:05.668 --> 21:07.803
No, no, nun, nun.

21:08.021 --> 21:09.294
What, what?

21:09.444 --> 21:11.060
- What did...?
- A nun...

21:11.222 --> 21:13.150
- A nun.
- A nun...

21:13.347 --> 21:14.902
A nun?!

21:15.161 --> 21:17.308
One of... yours.

21:17.448 --> 21:20.452
Yours...
One of... yours.

21:30.192 --> 21:32.178
We have to get you help!

21:39.151 --> 21:40.079
Operator.

21:40.222 --> 21:43.130
Operator, get me the police.

22:03.541 --> 22:05.963
Oh, God, no!

22:17.494 --> 22:18.725
Judy!

22:20.330 --> 22:21.771
Judy, you alive in there?

22:22.300 --> 22:23.537
Hold on.

22:29.436 --> 22:31.971
Hey... Terry.

22:32.079 --> 22:32.882
Jesus, Judy, I've been

22:32.988 --> 22:34.000
out here knocking
for ten minutes.

22:34.106 --> 22:35.181
Hang on.

22:37.579 --> 22:39.383
Hey, come on in.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.656
Excuse the clutter.

22:42.758 --> 22:43.660
Where were you last night?

22:43.757 --> 22:45.819
- Last night?
- We had a gig at the White Rose.

22:45.931 --> 22:47.571
- Oh...
- You didn't show up.

22:48.441 --> 22:51.207
- We had to go on without a singer.
- Oh, shit.

22:51.565 --> 22:54.370
I-I've, I've been a
little under the weather.

22:54.784 --> 22:57.194
I can see that.

22:57.553 --> 22:58.999
Might want to open a window.

22:59.115 --> 23:00.133
It's pretty ripe in here.

23:00.249 --> 23:01.396
How'd it go?

23:01.750 --> 23:03.825
Uh, went great.

23:04.086 --> 23:05.968
Barry called his cousin,

23:06.114 --> 23:08.244
and she got there
by the third set.

23:11.644 --> 23:12.674
What's this?

23:12.795 --> 23:16.570
Just a little something
to tide you over.

23:18.625 --> 23:20.599
You're out of the band, Judy.

23:21.403 --> 23:23.016
What, because of one gig?

23:23.126 --> 23:24.506
It's not just the one gig.

23:24.615 --> 23:26.423
You've been slipping
for a long time.

23:26.584 --> 23:29.302
We all noticed it,
and it got real clear

23:29.424 --> 23:31.491
last night after
Barry's cousin filled in.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.811
Barry's cousin?

23:33.934 --> 23:36.922
What, she's Dinah
Shore all of a sudden?

23:37.017 --> 23:38.104
She don't have to be.

23:38.207 --> 23:39.594
She was on key.

23:41.101 --> 23:41.894
He's been trying to get

23:42.019 --> 23:44.672
his fat cousin in
there for months now.

23:44.871 --> 23:46.624
No, this is a conspiracy.

23:46.739 --> 23:49.455
This is a conspiracy
against me!

23:50.420 --> 23:51.740
I'm sorry.

23:53.143 --> 23:55.636
Wait, hey, what do I have to do?

23:55.822 --> 23:57.072
Come on, Terry.

23:57.554 --> 24:01.554
Come on, man, tell me, just
tell me what I've got to do.

24:01.674 --> 24:02.942
- Stop it.
- Come on.

24:03.080 --> 24:04.984
I can make you feel real good.

24:05.103 --> 24:06.358
- You know, I've always wondered...
- Judy,

24:06.479 --> 24:09.498
- you are embarrassing yourself.
- ...what it felt like with a colored man.

24:09.619 --> 24:11.384
Stop it!
You smell of vomit.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.515
There's a card in there,
with a number.

24:15.101 --> 24:17.418
A detective, uh,
wants you to call him.

24:17.545 --> 24:18.751
What?

24:18.871 --> 24:20.924
Yeah, uh, there was
a hit-and-run

24:21.091 --> 24:23.351
couple blocks from the club
last Thursday night.

24:23.442 --> 24:24.403
A little girl got run down,

24:24.549 --> 24:27.389
and cops want to know
if anybody saw anything.

24:28.205 --> 24:29.628
You take care, Judy.

24:30.775 --> 24:32.267
We'll see you around.

25:08.210 --> 25:10.557
The search continues
tonight for the hit-and-run driver

25:10.673 --> 25:11.629
responsible...

26:23.706 --> 26:26.771
Excuse me, Miss,
is everything all right?

26:27.245 --> 26:28.637
Are you hurt?

26:30.594 --> 26:31.971
No.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.124
I'm fine.

26:34.638 --> 26:36.331
Everything's fine.

26:57.130 --> 26:58.362
Hello.

26:58.479 --> 26:59.937
Judy Martin?

27:01.365 --> 27:02.938
Who is this?

27:03.638 --> 27:05.724
It's your conscience calling.

27:06.415 --> 27:08.496
Mary Eunice, what have you done?

27:08.612 --> 27:09.632
What have <i>I</i> done?

27:09.720 --> 27:10.880
No, no, no.

27:11.247 --> 27:14.838
The question is...
what have <i>you</i> done?

27:14.974 --> 27:16.402
That dead man
lying on the floor--

27:16.504 --> 27:17.919
he was investigating you,

27:18.027 --> 27:19.435
or so his papers all show.

27:19.560 --> 27:23.526
A 15-year-old
unsolved hit-and-run case.

27:23.639 --> 27:25.639
How did you know about that?

27:25.751 --> 27:27.195
I know everything.

27:27.358 --> 27:29.489
I was in your head, remember?

27:29.813 --> 27:31.707
Lose your place, old man?

27:36.709 --> 27:38.685
Don't even think
about coming back here, Judy.

27:38.796 --> 27:40.577
You might want
to start running now,

27:40.887 --> 27:42.155
though the truth is,

27:42.271 --> 27:44.356
how far do you think
you can get?

27:44.588 --> 27:45.657
Oh, um,

27:45.769 --> 27:48.261
I left a bottle
of, um, Kentucky's.

27:48.379 --> 27:49.724
I think that is for you.

27:50.008 --> 27:51.700
I left something else
there for you, too.

29:50.596 --> 29:52.476
You jumped the gun again.

29:52.651 --> 29:54.858
It was a passing thought;

29:55.915 --> 29:57.920
nothing but a passing thought.

29:58.176 --> 30:00.441
Your song was
different this time--

30:00.747 --> 30:03.194
much more plaintive
and piercing.

30:04.556 --> 30:06.675
Never trust a drunk.

30:07.033 --> 30:09.585
I'm just the little girl
who cried wolf.

30:10.089 --> 30:11.853
Aren't you sick of me yet?

30:11.977 --> 30:14.502
I come when I'm called;
it's what I do, Jude.

30:14.618 --> 30:17.088
I don't judge;
I never judge.

30:18.157 --> 30:20.758
What was so different
this time?

30:26.894 --> 30:30.356
Was my song... so different...

30:30.492 --> 30:32.490
the night Casey left me,

30:32.680 --> 30:34.600
the night before our wedding,

30:34.722 --> 30:37.223
when I told him
he'd given me syphilis

30:37.340 --> 30:40.359
and I'd never be able
to have children?

30:40.514 --> 30:41.963
I forgave him.

30:42.075 --> 30:46.258
He just stared at me
like I didn't even exist,

30:46.386 --> 30:49.331
called me a liar and a whore.

30:49.649 --> 30:52.655
All I ever wanted
was my own family,

30:52.784 --> 30:55.053
my own children
to teach and love.

30:57.642 --> 31:00.312
Why didn't I die that night?

31:00.424 --> 31:03.947
You were young;
you still had hope.

31:04.239 --> 31:06.660
And the night I killed a child,

31:07.161 --> 31:10.622
the night I ran over
that little girl in blue,

31:11.264 --> 31:13.839
why not that night?

31:14.181 --> 31:17.114
That was when God revealed
He had a plan for you.

31:17.224 --> 31:19.275
He gave you a calling.

31:19.636 --> 31:21.785
And now He's taken it away.

31:23.380 --> 31:26.066
I've been living
on borrowed time, haven't I?

31:26.181 --> 31:28.709
Sooner or later, He was bound
to figure out...

31:29.333 --> 31:33.217
I never really rose
to His challenge.

31:33.364 --> 31:34.913
I'm still just a...

31:35.464 --> 31:37.112
drunken whore...

31:37.585 --> 31:39.119
and a murderer,

31:39.503 --> 31:40.814
trying to disguise

31:40.923 --> 31:44.612
my darkness under
that miserable black cloth.

31:44.722 --> 31:47.264
You deserve some peace, Jude.

31:47.366 --> 31:48.313
You deserve a peace

31:48.426 --> 31:50.729
befitting your extraordinary,
tireless efforts

31:50.847 --> 31:53.264
to find meaning in this life.

31:53.914 --> 31:54.938
How long can you live

31:55.068 --> 31:57.549
on free coffee
and crackers, Jude?

31:57.633 --> 31:58.815
The winters here are long,

31:58.924 --> 32:00.631
and they're very cold.

32:00.746 --> 32:02.838
And the whiskey
won't keep you warm.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.159
It just rots your insides.

32:05.294 --> 32:08.065
Peace is so close, Sister.

32:16.091 --> 32:17.944
I'm ready.

32:19.158 --> 32:21.711
But I need to do one last thing.

32:27.564 --> 32:29.164
Poor thing.

32:29.317 --> 32:31.087
Maybe we should
call Briarcliff.

32:31.189 --> 32:33.654
At least they could
give her a bed for the night.

32:45.641 --> 32:48.527
Sorry, she's a fussy
baby, this one.

32:48.820 --> 32:51.011
So you were saying
you were Missy's teacher?

32:51.130 --> 32:52.609
Hank, you bringing that coffee?

32:52.717 --> 32:53.664
I got it, dear.

32:53.771 --> 32:55.371
- Here you go.
- So kind.

32:56.914 --> 32:58.222
I, um...

32:58.515 --> 33:00.003
I know you have to get to work,

33:00.133 --> 33:02.676
so I'll only take
a minute of your time. I...

33:02.761 --> 33:03.541
So...

33:03.637 --> 33:05.553
you were her teacher, you say?

33:05.915 --> 33:07.478
No, actually...

33:07.782 --> 33:09.234
I'm a nun.

33:09.349 --> 33:10.530
You don't look like a nun.

33:10.624 --> 33:13.886
Honey, they're not
always in their habits.

33:14.118 --> 33:15.952
He's a little old-fashioned.

33:16.069 --> 33:17.120
So, you were her...

33:17.217 --> 33:19.050
Sunday school teacher?

33:24.493 --> 33:25.937
I, uh...

33:26.405 --> 33:28.599
remember her little blue coat.

33:28.769 --> 33:29.601
Oh, yeah.

33:29.717 --> 33:31.168
I bought that for her
'cause she pitched

33:31.275 --> 33:34.331
a full-on fit in the middle
of Filene's basement.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.722
That girl could not take
no for an answer.

33:36.847 --> 33:38.082
Right, Hank?

33:38.647 --> 33:39.827
The truth is,

33:40.824 --> 33:42.589
Mr. and Mrs. Stone...

33:42.713 --> 33:44.073
I came here

33:44.246 --> 33:45.511
to tell you a story about

33:45.604 --> 33:47.582
your daughter, Missy.

33:47.912 --> 33:48.723
And I want...

33:50.493 --> 33:51.439
What a night.

33:51.539 --> 33:53.782
Big bus accident--
three people dead,

33:53.910 --> 33:55.756
everyone else a bloody mess.

33:55.856 --> 33:58.094
- Oh, sweetheart.
- She sleep through the night?

33:58.270 --> 34:00.617
Yeah, only woke up once
around 1:00 a.m.

34:00.773 --> 34:02.115
Here's Mommy.

34:02.254 --> 34:04.564
We keep her when Missy
does the night shift.

34:04.769 --> 34:07.146
Oh, Missy, this is Sister...

34:07.802 --> 34:08.649
Um...

34:08.757 --> 34:10.280
what'd you say your name was?

34:11.110 --> 34:12.789
You're Missy?

34:13.034 --> 34:14.466
Little Missy?

34:15.315 --> 34:17.184
With the blue coat?

34:18.982 --> 34:20.514
Who are you?

34:25.347 --> 34:27.172
I'm so confused.

34:29.606 --> 34:32.340
I thought someone ran over you.

34:32.869 --> 34:34.485
I thought you died out there,

34:34.672 --> 34:36.327
on the street.

34:36.920 --> 34:39.485
You mean back then,
when I was a girl?

34:42.041 --> 34:44.052
Oh, forgive me. I, uh...

34:45.862 --> 34:47.583
All these years, I've been...

34:47.870 --> 34:50.067
lighting candles for your soul

34:50.202 --> 34:51.882
and your parents.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.887
You see, I, um...

34:54.172 --> 34:55.721
The accident happened

34:56.551 --> 34:58.711
right about the time
I was thinking of

34:58.841 --> 35:00.490
joining the church.

35:00.741 --> 35:02.897
In fact, it was...

35:03.685 --> 35:05.922
one of the reasons
that led me...

35:06.495 --> 35:08.835
to take the vows.

35:10.215 --> 35:13.099
And recently, I've been
struggling with my faith,

35:13.320 --> 35:17.411
wondering if I really
belong in the church,

35:17.811 --> 35:19.071
and it made me think of you

35:19.189 --> 35:20.471
and your tragedy.

35:20.600 --> 35:22.417
I thought if I came...

35:29.199 --> 35:31.158
And here you are.

35:34.270 --> 35:36.768
Hank struggled, too. Um...

35:36.888 --> 35:38.641
for a long time, he...

35:38.743 --> 35:40.689
he wanted to get revenge
on the bastard who ran her

35:40.868 --> 35:42.572
over, but I told him,

35:42.694 --> 35:45.751
"Hank, our Missy came home
to us with a few

35:45.852 --> 35:48.217
broken bones.
We get to live

35:48.345 --> 35:49.504
with our daughter.

35:49.626 --> 35:51.404
The monster who left her there

35:51.559 --> 35:53.373
has to live with himself."

35:59.878 --> 36:01.993
No. I won't.
I have to stay awake.

36:02.106 --> 36:04.084
Where is Sister Jude?
I need to speak to Sister Jude.

36:04.191 --> 36:05.371
It's all right!

36:05.480 --> 36:06.671
I'll see to her.

36:07.972 --> 36:10.335
Where's Sister Jude?
I need to speak to Sister Jude.

36:10.431 --> 36:12.054
Sister Jude is no longer
with us.

36:13.270 --> 36:14.910
I'm in charge now.

36:15.081 --> 36:16.784
- You?
- That's right.

36:17.110 --> 36:19.283
- Now, you simply must take...
- No.

36:19.433 --> 36:20.575
You don't understand.

36:20.684 --> 36:22.128
Dr. Thredson...

36:22.237 --> 36:23.685
Dr. Thredson isn't here either.

36:23.802 --> 36:25.165
He's a murderer.

36:26.572 --> 36:28.368
- What?
- He killed Wendy.

36:28.637 --> 36:29.841
Wendy?

36:29.951 --> 36:31.104
My Wendy.

36:31.226 --> 36:32.226
And all the others.

36:32.307 --> 36:33.347
It was him.

36:33.464 --> 36:34.468
It was Thredson.

36:34.571 --> 36:35.891
Right from the start,
it was him.

36:36.001 --> 36:37.471
You have to send for the police.

36:37.587 --> 36:39.027
You have to stop him.

36:39.908 --> 36:41.076
Calm down.

36:41.184 --> 36:42.211
Get back in bed, please,

36:42.319 --> 36:43.998
or I'll be forced to get
Frank to restrain you.

36:44.083 --> 36:45.205
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

36:45.740 --> 36:47.167
I can't be chained down again.

36:47.752 --> 36:49.340
You don't know what happened.

36:49.512 --> 36:51.114
I know you've been in a very,

36:51.406 --> 36:53.900
very serious
automobile accident,

36:54.009 --> 36:55.008
and you're confused.

36:55.119 --> 36:56.472
I'm not confused!

36:56.574 --> 36:59.252
I am telling you,
Kit Walker is innocent!

36:59.345 --> 37:01.733
Oliver Thredson is Bloody Face.

37:02.582 --> 37:05.635
I love your work, Bloody Face.

37:07.490 --> 37:09.179
He admitted everything to me.

37:10.157 --> 37:11.868
What he does to them.

37:12.694 --> 37:14.241
I believe you.

37:15.018 --> 37:16.169
You do?

37:16.757 --> 37:18.331
Yes.

37:23.186 --> 37:24.400
Please, Sister,

37:24.527 --> 37:25.945
he cannot know that I am here.

37:26.036 --> 37:27.607
No one knows.

37:28.001 --> 37:30.295
No one knows that you're here.

37:31.304 --> 37:34.276
Now, please, just...
just take these.

37:34.606 --> 37:36.084
You have to go to the police.

37:36.737 --> 37:39.027
All of the evidence
is in his basement.

37:39.135 --> 37:40.380
I understand.

37:40.933 --> 37:42.067
I do.

37:45.417 --> 37:47.388
It's where he kills them.

37:48.766 --> 37:50.829
It's where he violated me.

37:53.739 --> 37:55.744
You're safe now.

38:06.314 --> 38:07.404
How is she?

38:07.533 --> 38:09.479
She's still very confused,
I'm afraid.

38:09.661 --> 38:12.109
She claims that
Dr. Thredson attacked her.

38:12.215 --> 38:14.125
She claims... well...

38:14.650 --> 38:17.388
She insists that Kit
Walker is innocent.

38:17.503 --> 38:19.754
Well, state police got
a different opinion.

38:20.258 --> 38:22.175
Kit Walker escaped custody.

38:22.356 --> 38:23.617
He's a fugitive.

38:23.738 --> 38:25.516
Order on him is shoot on sight.

38:25.619 --> 38:26.786
My gracious.

38:54.988 --> 38:57.036
My child, what are you doing

38:57.166 --> 38:58.564
down here?

38:58.821 --> 39:00.881
Only a day ago you were
at the brink of death.

39:00.995 --> 39:02.875
You should be convalescing.

39:03.114 --> 39:04.421
Didn't you hear?

39:04.516 --> 39:06.533
I'm Dr. Arden's little miracle.

39:07.279 --> 39:10.089
Yet, I open my eyes,
and I'm still at Briarcliff.

39:10.203 --> 39:12.125
Can't say that's much
of an improvement.

39:12.447 --> 39:14.212
You make the best
of what life gives you.

39:14.317 --> 39:15.474
Come, Grace, go to your...

39:15.604 --> 39:16.933
No, please, Sister.

39:17.068 --> 39:18.407
I'm gonna crawl
out of my skin if I have

39:18.516 --> 39:20.314
to lay on that bed again.

39:23.999 --> 39:26.770
When I'm done cleaning up,
you'll have to go.

39:34.784 --> 39:37.004
Actually, you have to go now.

39:44.130 --> 39:45.493
What are you doing here?

39:45.757 --> 39:47.552
I couldn't let you
die here, Grace.

39:49.514 --> 39:50.819
Now come on.

39:53.548 --> 39:54.791
- Help!
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

39:54.890 --> 39:56.716
Help!

40:02.693 --> 40:03.677
No!

40:04.846 --> 40:06.047
Hey!

40:14.952 --> 40:16.308
- Drop it.
- No!

40:24.476 --> 40:26.337
- Grace?
- Stay away from her!

40:26.637 --> 40:28.554
Back up or I'll shoot you!

40:28.655 --> 40:30.288
Walker, I'll shoot you.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.575
Put your hands where
I can see them. Back up.

40:35.189 --> 40:36.898
Are you ready for me?

40:39.379 --> 40:40.813
Yes.

40:53.392 --> 40:55.160
I'm free.
