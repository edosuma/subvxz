Miss Havisham?

01:51.682 --> 01:53.077
We're home.

01:55.818 --> 01:57.950
This place is great.

01:57.985 --> 02:00.392
It's much bigger than
our flat in London.

02:00.427 --> 02:01.756
It's strange.

02:02.825 --> 02:05.089
It's not
how I remember it.

02:05.124 --> 02:06.860
Yeah, but that's
to be expected though,
right?

02:06.895 --> 02:08.433
It's been years.

02:12.241 --> 02:14.340
I think it's nice
that it's staying
in the family.

02:14.375 --> 02:17.134
We'll fix it up,
paint some walls.

02:17.972 --> 02:19.609
This is what we wanted.

02:23.109 --> 02:24.911
Welcome home.

02:47.067 --> 02:49.100
Okay, that's the last
of the bags.

03:43.090 --> 03:47.191
Family, hearth,
straw and stone.

03:51.967 --> 03:53.571
Start anew.

03:58.545 --> 04:00.204
A new start, Robert.

04:00.239 --> 04:02.283
One more, then we're done.

05:49.953 --> 05:51.183
Hey, Robert.

05:52.219 --> 05:53.658
Yeah?

05:53.693 --> 05:55.561
I was thinking
we could head into town.

standing at the end of my bar.

In the flesh.

06:25.725 --> 06:28.385
Well,
that is impossible.

06:28.420 --> 06:30.893
'Cause I heard
she up and took herself
to London,

06:30.928 --> 06:32.895
found some British guy
and settled down.

06:32.930 --> 06:34.831
Oh. Well, that would be me.

06:34.866 --> 06:36.063
Some British guy.

06:36.098 --> 06:38.769
Judy, this is Robert,
my husband.

06:38.804 --> 06:40.771
It is so nice
to meet you, Robert.

06:40.806 --> 06:42.234
Likewise, Judy.

06:42.269 --> 06:44.544
"Likewise."
Oh, I like that.

06:44.579 --> 06:45.941
It's fancy.

06:45.976 --> 06:48.405
We could use some
fancying up around here.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.242
Well,
I'll try my best, Judy.

06:51.377 --> 06:52.915
Sorry about your pa.

06:53.819 --> 06:54.983
Thank you.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.624
Tell you what.
Let's do this.

06:58.659 --> 07:00.120
Shots?

07:01.596 --> 07:03.387
It's the good stuff.

07:08.834 --> 07:09.866
To Edgar.

07:12.167 --> 07:13.232
To Edgar.

07:14.609 --> 07:15.839
To Edgar.

07:20.109 --> 07:21.614
Fucking hell.

07:23.343 --> 07:25.552
What is in that?
The secret recipe.

07:25.587 --> 07:27.147
If I tell you,
I'd have to kill you,

07:27.182 --> 07:28.621
but you definitely need
another one.

07:28.656 --> 07:30.282
Oh, no,
you don't have to.

07:30.317 --> 07:31.789
Oh, he does.
Yeah.

07:31.824 --> 07:34.220
I got this.
I can handle it.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.969
No, get off.

07:47.004 --> 07:49.268
What did you say
these are, anyway?

07:49.303 --> 07:51.039
They, uh...
They're "chillins"?

07:51.074 --> 07:52.139
Chitlins.

07:52.174 --> 07:54.273
Oh.

07:54.308 --> 07:55.340
Like 'em?

07:55.375 --> 07:56.583
Chitlins are good.

07:58.587 --> 08:00.378
What are they made
out of, anyway?

08:00.413 --> 08:02.380
They feel like, uh...
like chicken?

08:02.415 --> 08:04.657
Oh, uh, pig intestines.

08:07.090 --> 08:08.518
You fucking--

08:09.928 --> 08:11.961
Oh, my God.
Are you serious?

08:11.996 --> 08:13.600
Babe, gross.
I'm gross?

08:13.635 --> 08:15.030
You're making me eat
pig intestines.

08:15.065 --> 08:16.427
Hey, guys.

08:16.462 --> 08:19.573
These are from Larry
and Martha

08:19.608 --> 08:21.641
over there
in the back.
Huh.

08:21.676 --> 08:23.709
They just wanted
to say, "Welcome home."

08:23.744 --> 08:25.205
I am so wasted.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.844
Oh, God, it's gonna
be rude if I don't.

08:26.879 --> 08:28.472
This'll be
the last one.
Just pour it out.

08:28.507 --> 08:30.474
No, it's fine.
This'll be the last one.

08:34.381 --> 08:35.886
Okay.

08:35.921 --> 08:37.415
That's definitely
the last one.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.054
Maia!

08:46.701 --> 08:49.636
The prodigal daughter
has returned.

08:49.671 --> 08:51.231
Pastor Ellis.

08:51.266 --> 08:55.774
Now, would you please
just start calling me Joseph?

08:55.809 --> 08:58.711
You're a little
too long-grown for that
"Pastor Ellis" horseshit,

08:58.746 --> 09:00.372
don't you think?
Of course.

09:00.407 --> 09:01.472
Yeah.

09:02.717 --> 09:05.784
Who is this hungry
new addition
to the flock?

09:05.819 --> 09:07.511
This is
my husband Robert.

09:09.581 --> 09:10.855
Pig intestines.

09:13.860 --> 09:16.894
Judy gave him
a little too much
special moonshine.

09:16.929 --> 09:18.324
As well she should.

09:18.359 --> 09:21.129
Special drink
for a special guest.

09:21.164 --> 09:24.033
Well, Robert,
it is well past time

09:24.068 --> 09:25.496
that Maia
brought you around

09:25.531 --> 09:27.102
to meet everybody.

09:27.137 --> 09:30.567
A hearty welcome
to Briar Glen.

09:30.602 --> 09:34.439
We are very, very glad
that you are here
with us.

09:34.474 --> 09:35.506
Know what? Everybody!

09:36.476 --> 09:38.245
Everybody, let me
have your attention.

09:38.280 --> 09:42.018
It is with great pleasure that,
after many years,

09:42.053 --> 09:43.580
finally...

09:43.615 --> 09:47.254
...the daughter of the great
Edgar Cartwell Eden has

09:47.289 --> 09:48.959
returned to us.

09:48.994 --> 09:51.291
So I want everybody
to lift their glasses up.
Cheers.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.394
To our own Maia
and Robert.

09:55.429 --> 09:56.835
Cheers!

09:58.938 --> 10:01.708
Long live the...

12:02.424 --> 12:03.720
You okay?

12:23.478 --> 12:25.445
You're home.

12:33.620 --> 12:34.927
Hey, hey, hey.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.720
You okay?

12:36.755 --> 12:37.787
Hey.

12:37.822 --> 12:39.525
It was a bad dream,
huh?

12:43.102 --> 12:44.200
You all right?

12:45.830 --> 12:47.973
It's okay.

12:56.313 --> 12:57.477
God.

12:57.512 --> 12:58.984
What happened last night?

13:01.582 --> 13:07.157
Um, you got wasted
and fell off your chair.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.755
I had to bring you
home, remember?

13:11.790 --> 13:13.790
So embarrassing.

13:13.825 --> 13:15.594
It's okay.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.629
I took
care of you.

13:17.664 --> 13:20.269
Please.

13:21.437 --> 13:22.667
Stop.

13:31.843 --> 13:33.513
You have to stop
doing this.

13:34.615 --> 13:35.779
Doing what?

13:38.520 --> 13:39.893
Freezing me out.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.757
It's not gonna
bring her back.

13:55.801 --> 13:57.339
You blame me,
don't you?

14:00.080 --> 14:02.410
No. No,
of course not.

14:03.512 --> 14:05.347
No, I could never
blame you.

14:08.022 --> 14:11.221
I know how much having
a baby means to you.

14:13.324 --> 14:16.160
But it's like
the doctor said,
miscarriages happen.

14:16.195 --> 14:18.162
Especially the
first time around.

14:19.561 --> 14:22.199
Doesn't mean
we have to give up,
does it?

14:25.930 --> 14:27.908
What if
it happens again?

14:32.277 --> 14:34.013
I know
you're scared.

14:36.611 --> 14:38.644
I'm scared too.

14:38.679 --> 14:40.844
In the last...

14:40.879 --> 14:45.090
...year,
I've lost our baby...

14:47.556 --> 14:48.885
now my dad.

14:53.925 --> 14:56.068
I don't know
if I can handle
another loss.

15:01.405 --> 15:02.866
But I believe
in us.

15:08.115 --> 15:09.543
Don't you?

15:09.578 --> 15:12.150
Yes.

15:13.318 --> 15:14.713
Yes,
of course I do.

15:14.748 --> 15:17.485
I believe in us
more than fucking anything.

15:18.290 --> 15:19.883
I love you.

15:19.918 --> 15:21.093
I love you.

17:55.612 --> 17:56.644
What?

18:06.755 --> 18:07.952
Hmm.

18:09.560 --> 18:11.120
Yeah, I guess
I can see a resemblance.

18:11.155 --> 18:12.660
A resemblance?
Yeah.

18:13.729 --> 18:15.762
Maia, it looks
exactly like me.

18:18.899 --> 18:22.065
Yeah, well, maybe if you,
uh, wore those contacts
I bought you.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.275
Oh, God.

18:24.278 --> 18:25.706
See?

18:25.741 --> 18:27.972
Hmm. Yeah,
not sold.

18:28.007 --> 18:30.843
I'm gonna need, like,
to see a scowl.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.318
There you go.

18:33.353 --> 18:35.419
I'm glad
you find it funny.

18:37.786 --> 18:40.017
All right, fine, yeah.
It does look...

18:40.052 --> 18:42.327
It sort of looks like you,
yeah.

18:42.362 --> 18:44.153
Thank you.
Hmm.

18:44.188 --> 18:45.924
What do you
think it means?

18:45.959 --> 18:48.157
I don't think
it means anything.

18:48.192 --> 18:50.236
Mmm.
People go to museums

18:50.271 --> 18:52.634
and see themselves
in paintings all the time.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.900
This wasn't in a museum.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.870
It was in your attic.
Mmm.

18:59.676 --> 19:02.105
Yeah, well, my dad
traveled a lot
for work.

19:03.207 --> 19:04.679
He collected art.

19:04.714 --> 19:06.450
It was one
of his passions,

19:06.485 --> 19:08.716
so I guess
this could've come
from anywhere really.

19:09.620 --> 19:10.883
What does it say?

19:11.886 --> 19:14.425
Says,<i> "The Visitor Accepts."</i>

19:14.460 --> 19:16.328
Well, what exactly
is he accepting?

19:16.363 --> 19:18.429
I don't know.
His drink?

19:21.533 --> 19:23.896
Well, he's a visitor,
so maybe, uh,

19:23.931 --> 19:27.064
he's accepting an invitation
to visit.

19:37.450 --> 19:40.352
You're not still taking
that medication, are you?

19:41.421 --> 19:42.816
For your anxiety?

19:42.851 --> 19:44.521
No.
You sure?

19:44.556 --> 19:45.588
Yeah.

19:46.822 --> 19:49.955
No, I-I threw that
down the toilet
months ago.

19:49.990 --> 19:51.660
The doctor said
it's only for emergencies--

19:51.695 --> 19:53.860
Please, Maia, come on.
Not again.

19:53.895 --> 19:55.301
I'm off it.
I'm done.

19:55.336 --> 19:56.401
Okay.

20:25.828 --> 20:27.531
Well, here's
your receipt.

20:27.566 --> 20:28.895
All right.
Okay.

20:29.700 --> 20:32.437
It looks great.
Thank you.

20:32.472 --> 20:33.735
Here you go.

20:33.770 --> 20:35.231
You have a blessed day,
you hear?

20:35.266 --> 20:36.309
Thank you, Kathy.

20:37.774 --> 20:38.806
Hi.

20:41.745 --> 20:42.744
You're--

20:43.307 --> 20:44.515
Robert Burrows.

20:44.550 --> 20:47.111
Uh,
Maia Eden's husband.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.217
We should talk,
Robert.

21:03.668 --> 21:04.832
Will that be all?

21:09.168 --> 21:12.444
Um,
just today's paper,

21:12.479 --> 21:13.610
if you have it.
Sure.

21:13.645 --> 21:15.414
Let me grab one
for you.

21:39.539 --> 21:40.769
All righty, then.

21:40.804 --> 21:42.441
Here you go.
Great. Thank you.

21:42.476 --> 21:43.772
That's awesome.

21:43.807 --> 21:45.741
Um, how much
do I owe you?

21:45.776 --> 21:48.447
Oh, please.
Your money's no good here.

21:54.114 --> 21:59.282
Art is a lie
that makes us
realize the truth.

22:06.830 --> 22:08.896
You have a blessed day,
now.

22:12.363 --> 22:14.671
Okay.

22:27.983 --> 22:30.852
<i> Yeah, so it's two boxes</i>
<i>that haven't been delivered.</i>

22:30.887 --> 22:32.557
<i>Two boxes from London?</i>
Yeah. Yeah.

22:32.592 --> 22:36.858
One of them is a, uh...
just a bunch
of personal items,

22:36.893 --> 22:39.190
and then
in the other one,
there's a suit.

22:39.225 --> 22:41.027
<i>And you still</i>
<i>have not received them?</i>

22:41.062 --> 22:42.996
Right.
<i>What's</i>
<i>the tracking number?</i>

22:43.031 --> 22:44.470
Yeah, no. No, no, no.

22:44.505 --> 22:46.835
We-we, uh, we never received
a tracking number.

22:46.870 --> 22:48.870
<i>Can I transfer you</i>
<i>to our shipping department?</i>

22:48.905 --> 22:50.608
Okay.
Yeah, sure, I can wait.

22:54.944 --> 22:56.845
<i> This is Mike</i>
<i>from shipping.</i>

22:56.880 --> 22:58.176
Hello.
<i>Hello.</i>

22:58.211 --> 23:00.277
Hi. Yes. Yeah.
So this is--

23:00.312 --> 23:02.345
<i>Two boxes missing?</i>
Yeah. Yeah.

23:02.380 --> 23:04.523
This is probably
the fourth person

23:04.558 --> 23:06.085
I've spoken to
about this.

23:06.120 --> 23:07.460
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

23:07.495 --> 23:10.155
Yeah, we haven't
received two boxes.

23:10.190 --> 23:12.531
<i>Okay.</i>
We never got
a tracking number either.

23:12.566 --> 23:14.258
A couple of people
have said that,

23:14.293 --> 23:16.667
on your end, it says
it's been delivered.

23:16.702 --> 23:17.734
<i>Here.</i>

23:22.576 --> 23:24.477
I don't know.

23:24.512 --> 23:25.775
Your dad's suit?

23:25.810 --> 23:27.480
Well, you already stole
his overalls.

23:27.515 --> 23:31.077
Yeah,
but to his memorial?

23:31.112 --> 23:33.145
Well,
he wasn't wearing it
when he died.

23:34.082 --> 23:35.114
Go on.

23:36.447 --> 23:38.590
<i>We are here today</i>

23:38.625 --> 23:41.087
<i>to remember</i>
<i>the fortuitous life</i>

23:41.991 --> 23:44.420
of Edgar Cartwell Eden.

23:45.665 --> 23:47.159
Like most of us,

23:48.635 --> 23:51.130
Edgar's roots
in this town go...

23:51.165 --> 23:53.462
go back generations.

23:53.497 --> 23:55.574
All the way back
to the early days
when this was

23:55.609 --> 23:57.972
just a patch of dirt
on a road
to someplace else.

23:58.975 --> 24:00.744
With Edgar's help

24:00.779 --> 24:05.716
and the help
of generations of Edens
that came before him,

24:05.751 --> 24:10.413
Briar Glen was allowed
to-to become the safe haven

24:10.448 --> 24:12.987
for our community
that it is today.

24:15.354 --> 24:17.794
Y'all know how much

24:17.829 --> 24:20.357
Edgar loved this town
with all of his heart.

24:21.668 --> 24:26.737
He gave as much of himself
as he could possibly afford.

24:26.772 --> 24:32.303
He carried the weight
of his family's legacy
with honor and dignity.

24:33.174 --> 24:34.877
And make no mistake,

24:36.342 --> 24:40.179
we are less because of
his devastating absence.

24:44.185 --> 24:46.152
But there is hope.

24:46.187 --> 24:50.453
And that has come
to us in the form
of Edgar's daughter Maia

24:50.488 --> 24:54.490
and her new husband,
Robert Burrows.

24:54.525 --> 24:56.932
Robert, why don't you
stand up, let everybody
get a look at you?

24:56.967 --> 24:58.703
Everybody, give him
some encouragement.

24:58.738 --> 25:00.463
Robert!
Come on, Robert!

25:08.572 --> 25:10.814
Robert, I know
you're new to these parts,

25:10.849 --> 25:12.651
but I speak for everyone
when I say

25:12.686 --> 25:14.719
you already feel
like one of us.

25:21.024 --> 25:22.254
Thank you.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.228
All right.

25:29.263 --> 25:32.836
Nobody minds,
I think I'll read
from the big book again.

25:32.871 --> 25:35.839
I like the words.

25:35.874 --> 25:38.776
And I'll keep it short.
It's getting a mite warm
in here, I know.

25:45.785 --> 25:46.916
Hey.

25:48.689 --> 25:51.888
Gonna head out
to the shops.
You want anything?

25:51.923 --> 25:54.418
Um, no,
not that I can think of.

25:54.453 --> 25:55.958
I'll call you
if I do.

25:56.763 --> 25:58.026
Okay.

26:25.253 --> 26:26.384
Can I help you?

26:27.420 --> 26:29.189
Oh. Hi.

26:29.224 --> 26:31.895
I'm actually looking
for the other lady
that works here.

26:34.097 --> 26:36.768
I'm sorry.
Kathy's not here
right now.

26:37.969 --> 26:40.970
Do you know
when she'll be back?

26:43.502 --> 26:46.272
Can I just say,
on a personal note,

26:46.307 --> 26:49.077
how lovely it is
to have you here
in Briar Glen?

26:49.112 --> 26:53.180
The town has been
infinitely brighter
since you arrived.

26:54.821 --> 26:57.789
I'd be happy
to help you find anything
you might need.

27:00.794 --> 27:02.123
Uh...

28:07.861 --> 28:08.893
Hello?

28:16.100 --> 28:17.231
Hello?

30:06.672 --> 30:08.606
<i>"The Visitor</i>
<i>Watches It Burn."</i>

30:11.545 --> 30:13.116
That's not for sale.

30:13.151 --> 30:15.118
Oh, um...

30:15.153 --> 30:16.482
I'm sorry.
I, uh...

30:18.156 --> 30:20.519
I was just hoping
you might be able to

30:20.554 --> 30:22.521
give me some more
information about it.

30:23.392 --> 30:25.161
Anything would be
really helpful.

30:26.098 --> 30:28.164
It was here
when I bought the store.

30:30.399 --> 30:32.828
And judging
by your accent,

30:32.863 --> 30:38.471
I bet your schools
didn't teach you
the history of this place.

30:38.506 --> 30:40.836
So I'll give you
the short version.

30:42.345 --> 30:46.182
There was a whole lot
of bad going on
back then.

30:47.878 --> 30:52.254
And I'm not
the kind of person
who hides from evil.

30:52.850 --> 30:53.926
No, sir, I--

30:57.921 --> 30:59.525
No.

31:01.166 --> 31:02.693
It can't be.

31:06.798 --> 31:08.435
I know.

31:09.867 --> 31:12.010
Believe me,
I was shocked, too,
when I found it.

31:12.045 --> 31:15.244
I found another one
just like it
in my wife's family's house.

31:16.676 --> 31:18.709
Look,
I took a picture.

31:18.744 --> 31:20.249
How did you find me?

31:20.284 --> 31:21.580
It was a woman
named Kathy.

31:21.615 --> 31:25.452
She works in a store
in, uh, Briar Glen.

31:25.487 --> 31:27.960
She gave me this note
with your address on it.

31:27.995 --> 31:32.723
You listen to me,
and you listen good.

31:32.758 --> 31:35.264
You think
you want answers.

31:35.299 --> 31:37.002
You're wrong.

31:37.037 --> 31:40.830
The truth is
your worst enemy.

31:40.865 --> 31:44.372
What you need
is to run back
to London

31:44.407 --> 31:46.440
as fast as your legs
can carry you.

31:46.475 --> 31:47.936
Do you understand me?
Yeah.

31:47.971 --> 31:49.443
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have
come here.

31:49.478 --> 31:51.049
Now go
and don't come back.
I'm sorry.

31:51.084 --> 31:52.578
I wanted to check--
Don't you ever
come back!

31:52.613 --> 31:54.382
I'm leaving,
I'm leaving.
Sorry.

31:54.417 --> 31:55.515
Go!

32:30.750 --> 32:32.156
Hey. Where were you?

32:34.523 --> 32:35.687
I was worried.

32:39.396 --> 32:42.067
What's that
doing up there?

32:42.102 --> 32:43.530
What,
we can't laugh
about this yet?

32:43.565 --> 32:44.894
Come on.

32:48.867 --> 32:50.372
You know,
I just found
another one.

32:52.112 --> 32:54.211
What?
Another painting.

32:54.246 --> 32:56.048
Of him.

32:56.083 --> 32:59.810
This time, he was, um...
he was, like,
a Confederate soldier.

32:59.845 --> 33:03.121
There was this crazy
old lady there,
and she was, like...

33:03.156 --> 33:05.013
she was, like,
clawing at me.

33:05.048 --> 33:06.520
She said
I had to move back
to London.

33:06.555 --> 33:08.324
What--
How did she know
I was from London?

33:08.359 --> 33:10.788
Your accent?
No. No, no, no,
no, no.

33:10.823 --> 33:12.658
It was--
it was definitely
more than that.

33:12.693 --> 33:13.725
It felt like she...

33:14.827 --> 33:17.366
I felt like
she-she knew me.

33:17.401 --> 33:18.862
The way
she was looking
at me.

33:18.897 --> 33:20.468
I feel like
everyone knows me.

33:20.503 --> 33:22.140
Robert,
okay, listen.

33:22.175 --> 33:23.900
I put this painting up
because I thought
it would be

33:23.935 --> 33:27.211
a funny, you know,
inside joke
between the two of us.

33:30.282 --> 33:34.515
I mean, you don't actually
think that's you
in the paintings?

33:42.591 --> 33:43.656
Robert.

33:46.056 --> 33:47.627
I-I don't know.
It--

33:47.662 --> 33:49.860
Oh, my God.
It looks like me.

33:49.895 --> 33:52.269
This has got
to stop, Robert.

33:55.769 --> 33:57.967
We're gonna make
this place our home.

33:58.970 --> 34:00.508
Do you even
want to be here?

34:00.543 --> 34:01.806
Yes. Yes, I do.

34:01.841 --> 34:03.412
Are you sure?
Yes, of course.

34:03.447 --> 34:04.842
Of course. Yes.

34:09.948 --> 34:11.585
Just think the stress
is getting to me.

34:14.051 --> 34:17.096
The bad dreams,
the move.

34:20.728 --> 34:23.058
You're right.

34:23.093 --> 34:27.568
I just need to, like,
focus on you.

34:27.603 --> 34:30.109
And us and this house
we're in.

34:38.251 --> 34:39.943
Know what?

34:41.078 --> 34:42.616
I'm gonna go
finish up in here.

37:20.303 --> 37:21.577
No.

38:24.543 --> 38:26.378
Welcome home, boy.

39:25.065 --> 39:28.066
<i>It spills over</i>
<i>into direct attack,</i>

39:28.101 --> 39:32.444
<i>and the workers</i>
<i>tear the chosen queen</i>
<i>to pieces.</i>

39:39.112 --> 39:41.310
<i>Nothing can go to waste,</i>

39:41.345 --> 39:43.620
<i>even the royal carcass.</i>

39:46.053 --> 39:50.759
<i>Workers carry hungry larvae</i>
<i>over to feast</i>
<i>on the dead queen,</i>

39:50.794 --> 39:54.598
<i>including many that must have</i>
<i>been her own offspring.</i>

39:59.429 --> 40:00.472
You scared me.

40:00.507 --> 40:02.067
Sorry,
I didn't mean to.

40:03.433 --> 40:04.641
What?

40:11.111 --> 40:13.309
You serious?
Yeah.

40:19.416 --> 40:21.460
I'm gonna
be here for you.
I promise.

40:23.090 --> 40:26.058
I love you.
I love you.

40:51.382 --> 40:54.922
<i>And he doth deceive them</i>
<i>that dwell on the Earth</i>

40:54.957 --> 40:59.388
<i>by the means</i>
<i>of those miracles</i>
<i>which he hath power to do.</i>

40:59.423 --> 41:02.600
And the beast
was taken and--

41:43.500 --> 41:46.501
And the beast was taken

41:46.536 --> 41:52.507
and with him the prophet
who worked miracles
before him.

41:54.049 --> 41:58.755
These both were cast
into a lake of fire
burning with brimstone.

42:04.224 --> 42:05.861
Now, our Maia,

42:05.896 --> 42:08.358
she was always first
through the door
at Sunday school

42:08.393 --> 42:10.228
and last to leave.

42:10.263 --> 42:12.461
I had to kick her out
on, well...

42:12.496 --> 42:14.331
Oh.
...more than
one occasion.

42:14.366 --> 42:15.706
Don't give me
that face.

42:15.741 --> 42:17.268
You know it's true,
you little rascal.

42:19.074 --> 42:20.612
Ah, watch it. It's hot.

42:22.440 --> 42:23.582
Thank you.

42:27.478 --> 42:32.591
To your strong, healthy,
miracle baby boy.

42:34.287 --> 42:36.056
Cheers.
Cheers.

42:38.555 --> 42:40.863
Well, that's not
gonna do.
Drink up.

42:48.532 --> 42:51.335
You know, Robert,
I've been meaning
to ask you something.

42:55.308 --> 42:56.978
Are you
a true believer?

43:01.985 --> 43:03.248
Honestly, I'm not.

43:04.988 --> 43:06.449
Would you give me
your hands?

43:08.288 --> 43:09.320
Come on.

43:11.258 --> 43:12.730
Come on, now.
Give me your hands.

43:32.983 --> 43:34.279
You will.

43:35.348 --> 43:36.985
You will be.

43:37.020 --> 43:40.791
When you see for yourself,
you won't be able to deny.

43:45.259 --> 43:48.425
The, um...
the christening's
important to Maia.

43:48.460 --> 43:49.965
So it's important
to me too.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.329
Thank you.

43:56.105 --> 43:58.237
Well, of course.

43:58.272 --> 43:59.843
Of course.

43:59.878 --> 44:02.439
And I don't want you
to have any fears about that.

44:02.474 --> 44:05.013
We do
a simple ceremony.

44:07.886 --> 44:10.821
None of that
drowning the newborn
around here.

44:10.856 --> 44:13.956
That's a relief.

44:13.991 --> 44:15.683
Listen,
I'm just gonna go
and use the loo.

44:15.718 --> 44:17.223
Okay. Bye.

44:18.798 --> 44:19.929
Oh, he means
the bathroom.

44:19.964 --> 44:21.997
Oh. Down the hall
to the right.

46:12.274 --> 46:14.879
Thought I was gonna
have to send out
a search party for you.

46:14.914 --> 46:18.982
Sorry.
I-I took a wrong turn,
and I-I saw this painting.

46:19.017 --> 46:20.247
It's...

46:22.218 --> 46:23.987
Do you think it...

46:24.022 --> 46:25.120
It's you.

46:25.155 --> 46:26.616
Yeah.

46:29.357 --> 46:31.423
You should see
the look on your face.

46:31.458 --> 46:34.327
I had you there
for a minute,
didn't I?

46:36.199 --> 46:37.869
No, no.

46:37.904 --> 46:42.005
This here is none other
than the great
Alistair Edgar.

46:43.338 --> 46:45.734
Man that saved
this town.

46:45.769 --> 46:50.442
See, when our ancestors
first settled this place,
it was...

46:51.346 --> 46:53.478
it was dire.

46:53.513 --> 46:55.986
Famine, disease.

46:56.021 --> 46:58.813
The loss
of human life,
it was...

46:58.848 --> 47:00.650
it was unthinkable.

47:00.685 --> 47:05.820
To say it plainly,
this place was going
to hell in a handbag.

47:05.855 --> 47:07.162
That is, until

47:08.561 --> 47:12.365
Alistair found a way
to pull it up
out of the mud

47:12.400 --> 47:14.631
with his own
fair hands.

47:14.666 --> 47:17.799
Now, this portrait
was a gift from Alistair
to the town.

47:17.834 --> 47:22.012
But if you ask me,
real gift was
Alistair himself.

47:22.047 --> 47:24.311
You can't imagine
how inspiring it is
for me

47:24.346 --> 47:26.214
to wake up
every morning,

47:26.249 --> 47:28.117
first thing I see
is that man's face.

47:30.583 --> 47:32.385
It's the gift
that keeps on giving.

47:35.962 --> 47:38.193
I've seen other paintings
just like this.

47:40.659 --> 47:42.494
I swear it's the same guy
in every single one.

47:42.529 --> 47:46.696
He's...
He's always referred to
as "The Visitor."

47:48.568 --> 47:51.305
I mean, could it be
that it's Alistair
in every one?

47:55.806 --> 47:58.114
Genesis- 27.

47:59.348 --> 48:01.843
"God created man
in his own image,

48:03.220 --> 48:04.813
in the image of God

48:05.486 --> 48:07.189
he created him."

48:08.720 --> 48:09.818
What does that mean?

48:09.853 --> 48:11.754
Right.

48:11.789 --> 48:14.262
Bible verses
aren't your thing.

48:14.297 --> 48:16.693
How about this?

48:16.728 --> 48:19.003
There can never
be too much
of a good thing.

48:21.469 --> 48:23.898
I would just take it
as a sign.

48:23.933 --> 48:27.275
You are where
you are meant to be.

48:27.310 --> 48:29.211
And you know what?

48:29.246 --> 48:31.411
I think maybe it's time
for you to get
that young Maia home.

48:31.446 --> 48:33.050
She needs her rest.

48:33.085 --> 48:34.348
Sure.
Yeah, you're right.

48:34.383 --> 48:36.350
Um, look,
I'm sorry.

48:36.385 --> 48:37.813
I didn't mean
to come into your--

48:37.848 --> 48:39.815
Stop right there.

48:39.850 --> 48:43.027
You are welcome to go
anywhere you want to,
Robert.

48:43.986 --> 48:46.624
We're just so glad
that you are back.

48:51.103 --> 48:52.960
<i> I still cannot believe</i>
<i>you went in his bedroom.</i>

48:52.995 --> 48:54.863
He had one
of those paintings.

48:54.898 --> 48:56.700
Again with the paintings.
He said his name
was Alistair Edgar.

48:56.735 --> 48:58.042
Robert, please,
you promised--

48:58.077 --> 48:59.934
He said he was
the founder of your town.

49:01.443 --> 49:03.113
Alistair Edgar?

49:03.148 --> 49:06.809
Alistair Edgar
was born in the 1700s.

49:06.844 --> 49:09.449
So unless you have
a time machine
that I'm not aware of,

49:09.484 --> 49:10.978
I don't know
what to tell you,
Robert.

49:11.013 --> 49:12.584
I know I'm starting
to sound crazy,

49:12.619 --> 49:14.652
but this is really,
really beginning to--

49:14.687 --> 49:16.753
Oh, God.

50:09.412 --> 50:10.477
Hey.

50:11.744 --> 50:13.480
Oh. Hey.

50:13.515 --> 50:15.042
Where you going?

50:15.077 --> 50:17.715
I'm just off to, uh,
a doctor's appointment.

50:17.750 --> 50:20.223
Oh. Oh,
I didn't-didn't realize.

50:20.258 --> 50:22.159
No, it's not, uh,
anything important.

50:22.194 --> 50:23.391
It's just
a quick checkup.

50:23.426 --> 50:24.986
So I'm fine.
Oh. You sure?

50:25.021 --> 50:27.021
Yeah. Just wanted
to do this alone,

50:27.056 --> 50:29.397
if that's okay.
Okay.

50:29.432 --> 50:30.497
Bye.

51:04.027 --> 51:05.730
Hello.

51:05.765 --> 51:07.765
<i>Mr. Burrows,</i>
<i>I presume?</i>

51:09.802 --> 51:11.571
Yeah, speaking.

51:11.606 --> 51:13.067
<i>You're alone,</i>
<i>aren't you?</i>

51:14.675 --> 51:16.004
Yeah, I'm alone.

51:16.039 --> 51:17.280
Who is this?

51:17.315 --> 51:19.073
<i>Let that be</i>
<i>your first lesson.</i>

51:19.108 --> 51:21.977
<i>In the town of Briar Glen,</i>
<i>you, sir, are never alone.</i>

51:23.618 --> 51:25.288
Okay,
thanks for that.
I'm gonna hang up.

51:25.323 --> 51:26.586
<i>No. Wait.</i>

51:28.590 --> 51:29.655
What is it?

51:31.120 --> 51:32.790
<i>I want you to come</i>
<i>to the window</i>

51:32.825 --> 51:34.891
<i>on the far east side</i>
<i>of your house.</i>

51:34.926 --> 51:36.398
<i>Look outside.</i>

51:36.433 --> 51:37.762
I'm really not
in the mood, okay?

51:37.797 --> 51:39.929
<i>I assure you</i>
<i>I am deadly serious.</i>

51:39.964 --> 51:42.602
<i>Just ask</i>
<i>our mutual acquaintance,</i>

51:42.637 --> 51:44.142
<i>The Visitor.</i>

52:14.504 --> 52:16.966
My, my.

52:17.001 --> 52:18.605
Will you look
at that?

52:18.640 --> 52:20.805
It really is uncanny,
isn't it?

52:23.810 --> 52:25.139
Maxwell Braun.

52:25.174 --> 52:27.185
Purveyor of fine arts
and antiquities.

52:28.287 --> 52:30.782
Please get in
before anyone sees us.

52:30.817 --> 52:34.049
Yeah, I... I don't think
I'm gonna do that. Thanks.

52:35.261 --> 52:36.689
You want answers,
don't you?

52:39.595 --> 52:41.331
It's now or never.

52:47.229 --> 52:49.438
I call this
"The Visitor series."

52:51.904 --> 52:54.410
This is the first one
that caught my eye.

52:54.445 --> 52:56.170
I was shopping
a collection in Germany,

52:56.205 --> 52:58.909
mostly pieces
from the '30s and '40s,

52:58.944 --> 53:01.945
around the time
of the Second World War.

53:01.980 --> 53:04.915
It was completely buried
amongst the morass.

53:04.950 --> 53:07.148
But something about it
called to me.

53:07.183 --> 53:09.491
If I'm honest,
I think it was
'cause I thought

53:09.526 --> 53:10.888
you were easy
on the eyes.

53:12.331 --> 53:13.561
Or he was.

53:13.596 --> 53:15.497
Whatever.
You get my point.

53:15.532 --> 53:17.158
Anyway...

53:17.193 --> 53:19.501
...I purchased it
to add to my collection,

53:19.536 --> 53:21.965
then after some time,
it faded from memory.

53:22.000 --> 53:24.066
That is,
until a few years later

53:25.102 --> 53:26.574
when I came across this.

53:36.245 --> 53:38.179
All right, this is...

53:38.214 --> 53:39.983
this is really starting
to creep me out now.

53:40.018 --> 53:43.558
These are just
the tip of the iceberg.

53:44.792 --> 53:47.265
Congo during
Leopold's brutal reign.

53:48.565 --> 53:49.894
Cambodian genocide

53:49.929 --> 53:51.731
during the 1970s.

53:52.767 --> 53:54.437
It became an obsession.

53:54.472 --> 53:58.969
Mining collections,
libraries, museums,
estate sales.

53:59.004 --> 54:02.940
Uncovering hundreds of photos,
all of them featuring

54:02.975 --> 54:04.711
this same man.

54:04.746 --> 54:07.241
And each of them
corresponding to moments
in human history

54:07.276 --> 54:09.518
we wish
we could forget.

54:13.051 --> 54:14.215
Is his name Alistair?

54:15.757 --> 54:18.395
I spent years trying
to ascertain his identity.

54:18.430 --> 54:19.462
To no avail.

54:20.289 --> 54:21.794
Nearly drove me mad.

54:21.829 --> 54:24.566
Then one frustrating
drunken night,

54:24.601 --> 54:26.898
I stumbled across
an online forum

54:26.933 --> 54:31.067
dedicated to rare
and forgotten
contemporary art.

54:32.510 --> 54:34.510
That's where I met
Margaret Delacroix.

54:37.108 --> 54:40.076
From the antique store.
Yeah.

54:40.111 --> 54:42.276
She tumbled down
this rabbit hole
years before me.

54:42.311 --> 54:44.619
Along with a group
of like-minded
individuals,

54:44.654 --> 54:47.985
she made
significant strides
towards discovering

54:48.020 --> 54:51.153
the insidious truth
behind this man's
identity.

54:52.255 --> 54:55.960
And for that,
she paid the ultimate price.

55:02.298 --> 55:03.506
She died?

55:10.449 --> 55:11.679
So who is he?

55:13.375 --> 55:16.387
He is both you
and not you, Robert.

55:20.822 --> 55:22.525
What does that
even mean?

55:22.560 --> 55:25.528
It means you're still
in control
of your own destiny.

55:25.563 --> 55:27.794
You can decide.

55:27.829 --> 55:30.632
But just know
that decision will have
graver repercussions

55:30.667 --> 55:32.359
than you could ever
possibly fathom.

55:32.394 --> 55:35.703
Can you just please
just stop talking to me
in riddles?

55:35.738 --> 55:36.968
What decision?

55:37.003 --> 55:40.609
Just tell me,
honestly and clearly,

55:40.644 --> 55:42.138
what the fuck
is going on?

55:46.749 --> 55:48.947
This is not
your home, Robert.

55:48.982 --> 55:50.685
These people
are not your friends.

55:50.720 --> 55:53.017
And if you're being
honest with yourself,

55:53.052 --> 55:55.657
I think you know
that already.

55:55.692 --> 55:58.253
Their gain is not only
your loss,

55:58.288 --> 56:00.530
but the rest
of the world's loss
as well.

56:00.565 --> 56:03.159
But you can
still leave.

56:03.194 --> 56:04.864
Go back to London,
or better yet,

56:04.899 --> 56:06.965
find somewhere
even more remote

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
where nobody can
possibly find you.

56:10.399 --> 56:12.069
By all means,
be happy.

56:12.104 --> 56:14.973
Use this money
to create and live
a comfortable life.

56:15.008 --> 56:17.041
Just live it
anonymously.

56:19.342 --> 56:21.243
What about my wife?

56:21.278 --> 56:22.948
We're expecting a son.
I can't just leave.

56:24.248 --> 56:25.555
A boy.

56:26.921 --> 56:28.723
This is even more urgent
than I thought.

56:28.758 --> 56:30.989
What has my son
got to do with this?

56:31.024 --> 56:33.860
You, your son
and every male heir
in your bloodline

56:33.895 --> 56:36.896
from here until eternity
will be affected

56:36.931 --> 56:38.832
by the choice
you make, Robert.

56:38.867 --> 56:42.132
Go, and be the good man
you were raised to be.

56:42.167 --> 56:45.168
Or stay and end up
in one of these photos.

56:45.203 --> 56:49.205
Stay and become
The Visitor.

57:48.497 --> 57:51.003
<i> Robert?</i>

57:53.205 --> 57:54.512
Robert.

58:02.148 --> 58:03.521
Robert!

58:14.864 --> 58:16.534
Been thinking
a lot recently.

58:18.362 --> 58:21.528
What with the baby coming,
everything that's going on
with these paintings--

58:21.563 --> 58:22.969
Again with
the paintings.

58:23.004 --> 58:24.938
I think we should move
back to London.

58:27.910 --> 58:29.206
Excuse me?

58:29.241 --> 58:32.979
Something is off
about this place, Maia.

58:33.014 --> 58:36.312
Maybe you don't see it
because you grew up here.

58:36.347 --> 58:37.984
Maybe you blocked it out.

58:38.756 --> 58:41.119
But I don't feel safe.

58:41.154 --> 58:44.518
Why? Because you bear
a passing resemblance
to a man in a painting?

58:44.553 --> 58:46.421
Yes. Actually, that.

58:47.831 --> 58:51.063
Since we got here,
there have been
real consequences.

58:51.098 --> 58:52.229
People have died.

58:52.264 --> 58:53.736
Who?

58:53.771 --> 58:56.068
Margaret Delacroix,
the lady from the art shop.

58:56.103 --> 58:58.807
And what about Kathy?
One minute, she's here,
the next minute, she's gone.

58:58.842 --> 58:59.907
I'm sure Kathy is fine.
Poof.

58:59.942 --> 59:02.305
And no one
seems to care!

59:03.649 --> 59:05.880
What if we're next?

59:05.915 --> 59:08.080
Do you know how crazy
this sounds, Robert?

59:08.115 --> 59:11.116
Why? Because I want
to raise my child
in a place that feels safe?

59:11.151 --> 59:13.283
No, what's crazy
is that after we've taken
all of our stuff

59:13.318 --> 59:15.384
halfway across the world,
now you're pulling this shit?

59:15.419 --> 59:17.221
I'm not pulling
anything.

59:18.554 --> 59:20.697
I met a guy today,
said his name
was Maxwell Braun.

59:20.732 --> 59:23.733
Maxwell Braun?
That's what this is about?
He's famously insane!

59:23.768 --> 59:25.394
He had information.
He showed me photos.

59:25.429 --> 59:26.901
What about me?

59:27.871 --> 59:28.936
What about
what I want?

59:28.971 --> 59:31.708
This is my home, Robert.

59:31.743 --> 59:37.076
And for once in my life,
it's starting to feel
like my home.

59:37.111 --> 59:39.111
I'm not gonna give that up
over some fucking delusion.

59:39.146 --> 59:41.949
This is not
a fucking delusion.

59:41.984 --> 59:43.148
Okay?

59:58.495 --> 59:59.769
You can go to London.

1:00:04.666 --> 1:00:06.039
You'll be going alone.

1:01:49.441 --> 1:01:51.573
Family, hearth,

1:01:51.608 --> 1:01:53.509
straw and stone.

1:01:58.857 --> 1:02:00.153
Start anew.

1:04:08.580 --> 1:04:10.316
<i>Robert, it's Maxwell.</i>

1:04:10.351 --> 1:04:11.922
<i>I received your message.</i>

1:04:11.957 --> 1:04:14.518
<i>I'm here</i>
<i>at our meeting place</i>
<i>as you requested,</i>

1:04:14.553 --> 1:04:16.784
<i>but I can't stay here</i>
<i>much longer.</i>

1:04:16.819 --> 1:04:19.556
<i>You don't know</i>
<i>what these people</i>
<i>are capable of.</i>

1:04:19.591 --> 1:04:20.854
<i>Please hurry.</i>

1:04:22.924 --> 1:04:25.595
<i>Where have you been?</i>

1:05:12.281 --> 1:05:13.544
Mr. Braun?

1:07:40.693 --> 1:07:41.923
Maia!

1:07:44.400 --> 1:07:45.762
Maia!

1:07:51.242 --> 1:07:52.373
Maia?

1:07:58.645 --> 1:07:59.809
Maia?

1:09:20.562 --> 1:09:21.990
He never loved me.

1:09:24.830 --> 1:09:25.862
Maia?

1:09:26.700 --> 1:09:28.194
Who is this?

1:09:28.229 --> 1:09:29.635
He wanted a son.

1:09:30.539 --> 1:09:32.000
He needed a son.

1:09:33.938 --> 1:09:36.103
I wanted to tell you
for so long.

1:09:37.810 --> 1:09:40.173
But Pastor Ellis
convinced me
you weren't ready.

1:09:43.783 --> 1:09:45.178
Not ready for what?

1:09:48.920 --> 1:09:50.623
Maia, who the fuck
is this?

1:09:52.726 --> 1:09:54.891
Edgar Cartwell Eden.

1:10:01.372 --> 1:10:02.734
Our father.

1:10:07.037 --> 1:10:09.345
Look, I know it's a lot
to take in, Robert.

1:10:10.546 --> 1:10:12.843
But it is time
that you hear the truth.

1:10:22.492 --> 1:10:24.294
<i>You were kidnapped, Robert.</i>

1:10:43.447 --> 1:10:47.174
<i> They smuggled you</i>
<i>to London, found you a family</i>
<i>far away from us.</i>

1:10:53.985 --> 1:10:55.721
<i>They tried to break the cycle.</i>

1:10:57.318 --> 1:10:59.725
Braun. Margaret.

1:10:59.760 --> 1:11:01.430
Amongst others.

1:11:01.465 --> 1:11:02.893
But they got
what they deserved.

1:11:05.260 --> 1:11:06.699
So you killed them?

1:11:10.606 --> 1:11:12.672
Oh, no, sweetheart.

1:11:15.710 --> 1:11:16.775
You did.

1:11:18.581 --> 1:11:21.549
Those aren't nightmares
you've been having,
are they, Robert?

1:11:39.569 --> 1:11:41.668
That's not me.

1:11:41.703 --> 1:11:43.164
That never happened.

1:11:55.486 --> 1:11:57.354
<i> Robert, you have</i>
<i>to stop fighting this.</i>

1:11:58.346 --> 1:12:00.489
Deep down,
you know what you are.

1:12:11.700 --> 1:12:13.359
<i>Oh, no, please.</i>

1:12:13.394 --> 1:12:16.362
Oh, no.

1:12:16.397 --> 1:12:17.869
No, please.

1:12:17.904 --> 1:12:19.640
You don't have
to do this.

1:12:19.675 --> 1:12:23.039
<i>No, please.</i>
<i>Please. Please.</i>

1:12:23.074 --> 1:12:24.513
Please. Please.

1:12:27.518 --> 1:12:29.551
You're a light-bearer,
Robert.

1:12:30.983 --> 1:12:33.214
A vessel
for a greater power.

1:12:33.249 --> 1:12:36.492
Just like every
firstborn male in our family
since Alistair

1:12:36.527 --> 1:12:39.385
sacrificed his bloodline
for the people of this town.

1:12:39.420 --> 1:12:40.661
No.

1:12:40.696 --> 1:12:42.223
No, this
isn't real.

1:12:42.258 --> 1:12:44.896
This is all
in my messed-up,
stupid fucking head.

1:12:46.064 --> 1:12:47.701
This is your privilege.

1:12:48.671 --> 1:12:50.099
Don't you understand?

1:12:50.134 --> 1:12:53.707
I was sent out
into the world
as a little girl

1:12:53.742 --> 1:12:55.676
to find you
and bring you home.

1:12:55.711 --> 1:12:57.040
Took me years!

1:12:57.075 --> 1:13:00.340
I have sacrificed
so much for this family!

1:13:00.375 --> 1:13:02.012
Now it's your turn.

1:13:11.353 --> 1:13:14.255
I don't know
what these people
have been telling you

1:13:14.290 --> 1:13:18.028
or how they brainwashed you,
but you need to listen to me.

1:13:18.063 --> 1:13:20.635
I'm Robert. You're Maia.
We're married.

1:13:20.670 --> 1:13:23.231
We were living
together in London,
and then your father--

1:13:23.266 --> 1:13:25.002
Our father.
Our father!
Your father--

1:13:25.037 --> 1:13:27.477
Your father passed away,
and now we're here

1:13:27.512 --> 1:13:29.908
in your childhood home,
and...

1:13:38.116 --> 1:13:39.720
You're-you're pregnant.

1:13:41.218 --> 1:13:43.889
Jesus fucking Christ.
You're pregnant?

1:13:48.896 --> 1:13:50.093
Our son...

1:13:53.131 --> 1:13:54.471
is our future.

1:13:59.137 --> 1:14:00.939
He was always
part of the plan.

1:14:00.974 --> 1:14:03.810
In London,
we were supposed
to have a little girl!

1:14:07.310 --> 1:14:08.617
I did my part.

1:14:20.697 --> 1:14:22.598
What is that
supposed to mean?

1:14:26.329 --> 1:14:27.966
You needed a boy.

1:14:31.004 --> 1:14:32.575
You fuck--

1:14:43.280 --> 1:14:44.477
Oh, fuck.

1:14:45.755 --> 1:14:47.656
Oh, what is
happening to me?

1:14:53.631 --> 1:14:55.664
You stopped taking
your medication.

1:15:00.528 --> 1:15:03.199
The herbs are beginning
to work. Hey, Robert.

1:15:05.368 --> 1:15:07.038
It's okay.

1:15:07.975 --> 1:15:09.711
They're helping you
to transition.

1:15:15.147 --> 1:15:18.313
We can finally
be the family
we always wanted.

1:15:22.154 --> 1:15:25.485
Be who you were
always meant to be.

1:15:40.205 --> 1:15:42.271
Oh, my God,
I've so been duped.

1:15:45.848 --> 1:15:47.716
Do they sell
pecan pie here?

1:15:49.346 --> 1:15:51.819
Uh, no, I don't--
I don't think so.

1:15:51.854 --> 1:15:53.887
Yeah. I, uh...

1:15:53.922 --> 1:15:56.153
I asked this man
outside my hotel

1:15:56.188 --> 1:15:59.255
where in this city
I could get
a slice of pecan pie.

1:15:59.290 --> 1:16:01.059
He gave me
this address.

1:16:01.094 --> 1:16:04.458
Yeah, I definitely think
he was pulling your leg.

1:16:04.493 --> 1:16:06.669
I think you
might be right there.

1:16:06.704 --> 1:16:09.199
Damn.

1:16:09.234 --> 1:16:12.136
Your first time
in London?

1:16:12.171 --> 1:16:14.941
That obvious?

1:16:14.976 --> 1:16:16.943
Yeah, there's not
a lot of pecan pie spots.

1:16:16.978 --> 1:16:18.505
No kidding.

1:16:30.959 --> 1:16:32.288
I'm Robert,
by the way.

1:16:33.555 --> 1:16:34.587
Robert.

1:16:35.766 --> 1:16:36.996
I'm Maia.

1:16:46.304 --> 1:16:47.677
Start anew!

1:16:47.712 --> 1:16:49.503
...when he takes his throne.

1:16:49.538 --> 1:16:53.474
Family, hearth,
straw and stone!

1:16:53.509 --> 1:16:57.148
Start anew
when he takes his throne!

1:16:57.183 --> 1:16:58.644
Family, hearth...

1:16:58.679 --> 1:17:01.581
Brothers and sisters,
we are saved.

1:17:01.616 --> 1:17:05.453
The Eden bloodline
will finally be restored.

1:17:05.488 --> 1:17:09.589
We humbly present our bodies
as a living sacrifice

1:17:09.624 --> 1:17:13.230
to he who came to us
in our time of need

1:17:13.265 --> 1:17:16.497
and offered us power,
purpose and hope.

1:17:17.973 --> 1:17:20.776
We invoke you
to awaken this vessel

1:17:20.811 --> 1:17:24.813
to prepare Lucian,
he of purest Eden blood,

1:17:24.848 --> 1:17:26.881
to fulfill his destiny

1:17:26.916 --> 1:17:30.049
as the final prophecy
has foretold.

1:17:30.084 --> 1:17:31.952
...as he takes his throne.

1:17:31.987 --> 1:17:33.613
Family, hearth,
straw and stone.

1:17:33.648 --> 1:17:36.022
It is the last hour,

1:17:36.057 --> 1:17:38.959
the hour
when darkness reigns!

1:17:38.994 --> 1:17:42.963
Family, hearth,
straw and stone!

1:17:42.998 --> 1:17:45.163
He prepares the vessel!

1:17:45.198 --> 1:17:48.903
Family, hearth,
straw and stone...

1:17:48.938 --> 1:17:51.664
He makes
his way into this world!

1:17:51.699 --> 1:17:53.699
Family, hearth,
straw and stone.

1:17:53.734 --> 1:17:55.173
He comes!

1:17:55.208 --> 1:17:58.011
Start anew
when he takes his throne.

1:17:59.707 --> 1:18:01.344
<i>Welcome home, boy.</i>

1:18:20.266 --> 1:18:21.804
Find him, Maia.

1:18:43.751 --> 1:18:45.894
Welcome, baby Lucian,

1:18:45.929 --> 1:18:49.766
bringer of light,
lord of fire and blood.

1:18:51.363 --> 1:18:56.597
We charge you now, Robert,
to raise him well,

1:18:56.632 --> 1:19:02.372
that on your death,
he will become you

1:19:02.407 --> 1:19:06.178
and complete our dark lord's
work on this Earth.

1:19:09.711 --> 1:19:12.415
Take the throne.
Rise up now,
baby Lucian.

1:19:12.450 --> 1:19:14.681
The last in your line.

1:19:14.716 --> 1:19:16.518
The chosen one.

1:19:16.553 --> 1:19:18.586
The long wait
is over.

1:19:18.621 --> 1:19:20.390
Your time is upon us.

1:19:20.425 --> 1:19:22.392
Take the throne.

1:19:22.427 --> 1:19:25.868
Take the throne.
Take the throne.

1:19:25.903 --> 1:19:27.628
Take the throne.

1:19:27.663 --> 1:19:31.368
Take the throne.
Take the throne.

1:19:31.403 --> 1:19:33.238
Take the throne.

1:19:33.273 --> 1:19:36.945
Take the throne.
Take the throne.

1:19:36.980 --> 1:19:38.408
Take the throne.

1:20:37.535 --> 1:20:39.832
Will you
accept this honor, Robert?

1:22:24.642 --> 1:22:26.147
I'm off.

1:22:26.182 --> 1:22:27.610
I'll see you
in a few days.

1:22:39.591 --> 1:22:41.789
<i>Brothers and sisters,</i>

1:22:41.824 --> 1:22:44.363
<i>today is a new dawn.</i>

1:22:45.498 --> 1:22:48.829
<i>It is a time of destruction,</i>

1:22:48.864 --> 1:22:51.172
<i>a time of renewal.</i>

1:23:00.150 --> 1:23:05.186
<i>Now The Visitor will make</i>
<i>his dwelling place among us.</i>

1:23:06.255 --> 1:23:09.289
<i>And from our humble hearth,</i>

1:23:09.324 --> 1:23:11.324
<i>he will cast his reign</i>

1:23:11.359 --> 1:23:15.229
<i>like a shadow</i>
<i>over all the world.</i>

1:23:36.384 --> 1:23:38.351
<i>Blood,</i>

1:23:38.386 --> 1:23:42.718
<i>tears will spill forth</i>
<i>from his mouth.</i>

1:23:44.194 --> 1:23:50.055
<i>They will bow before him,</i>
<i>one and all.</i>

1:23:50.090 --> 1:23:53.795
<i>Engulfed in his unholy fire,</i>

1:23:53.830 --> 1:23:57.106
<i>the world will kneel.</i>

1:23:58.065 --> 1:24:01.407
<i>And we,</i>
<i>brothers and sisters,</i>

1:24:01.442 --> 1:24:05.180
<i>we shall be</i>
<i>at his right hand</i>

1:24:05.215 --> 1:24:08.414
<i>as he assumes his throne.</i>

1:24:34.277 --> 1:24:37.069
Robert! Robert! Robert!

1:24:37.104 --> 1:24:38.972
Robert! Robert!

1:24:39.007 --> 1:24:41.909
Robert! Robert! Robert!

1:24:41.944 --> 1:24:43.911
Robert! Robert!

1:24:43.946 --> 1:24:46.782
Robert! Robert! Robert!

1:24:46.817 --> 1:24:48.685
Robert! Robert!

1:24:48.720 --> 1:24:51.556
Robert! Robert! Robert!

1:24:51.591 --> 1:24:53.558
Robert! Robert!

1:25:02.162 --> 1:25:05.603
<i>For now, we lay in wait,</i>

1:25:05.638 --> 1:25:10.674
<i>as he goes forth</i>
<i>to plant the seeds</i>
<i>for what is to come.</i>

1:25:12.139 --> 1:25:14.007
<i>A new kingdom.</i>

1:25:15.384 --> 1:25:17.483
<i>A new beginning.</i>
