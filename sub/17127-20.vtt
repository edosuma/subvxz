18:15.525 --> 18:16.826
YOU´RE RIGHT.

18:16.826 --> 18:18.228
IT´S MUCH EASIER
 TO STAY AND BE ABUSED.

18:18.228 --> 18:19.869
GO AHEAD.
 THROW YOUR LIFE AWAY.

18:19.869 --> 18:21.771
´CAUSE I DON´T GIVE A DAMN
 ANYMORE.

18:25.135 --> 18:27.737
I SCREWED UP.
 SORRY.

18:27.737 --> 18:29.139
NOW THAT YOU´VE APOLOGIZED,

18:29.139 --> 18:30.880
WE CAN WORK
 ON YOUR SELF-ESTEEM.

18:30.880 --> 18:32.882
I´LL TALK TO GEORGE
 ABOUT YOU STAYING.

18:32.882 --> 18:34.184
NIGHTY-NIGHT.

18:35.485 --> 18:37.547
GEORGE, WHERE´S CARMEN?
 I WANT TO TALK TO HER.

18:37.547 --> 18:39.819
I TOLD HER TO WAIT IN THE
 LIVING ROOM TILL MARISOL´S GONE.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.191
LISTEN...

18:41.191 --> 18:44.494
I´M SORRY.
 THIS WAS ALL MY FAULT.

18:44.494 --> 18:47.657
OH, NO, NICE TRY,
 BUT I´M NOT FALLING FOR THAT.

18:47.657 --> 18:49.399
GEORGE,
 THIS IS NOT A TRICK.

18:49.399 --> 18:50.800
I´M SAYING IT WAS MY FAULT.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.362
YOU CAN AGREE WITH ME.

18:52.362 --> 18:54.404
SO WE´RE NEVER HELPING ANYONE
 EVER AGAIN?

18:55.805 --> 18:57.407
NEVER.

18:57.407 --> 19:00.240
IF THERE´S SOMEONE
 ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD,

19:00.240 --> 19:02.412
AND THEY´RE DYING,
 WHAT DO WE DO?

19:02.412 --> 19:05.375
DRIVE ON BY.

19:05.375 --> 19:09.319
AND IF SOMEONE LEAVES A BABY
 ON THE DOORSTEP?

19:10.720 --> 19:14.524
WAIT TILL NIGHT
 AND LET THE COYOTES GET IT!

19:14.524 --> 19:16.186
THAT´S MY GIRL!

19:16.186 --> 19:18.258
WELL, IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES
 THIS WILL ALL BE OVER

19:18.258 --> 19:20.159
WHEN MARISOL´S
 OUT OF THE HOUSE.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.291
LISTEN, ABOUT THAT.

19:21.291 --> 19:23.793
NO!

19:23.793 --> 19:27.297
YOU DON´T EVEN KNOW
 WHAT I´M GONNA SAY!

19:27.297 --> 19:28.468
I GOT AN IDEA.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.208
WAKE UP, FOOL.

19:38.208 --> 19:39.749
WHAT?

19:39.749 --> 19:40.950
WE TALKED.

19:40.950 --> 19:42.482
AND WHILE WHAT YOU DID
 WAS WRONG,

19:42.482 --> 19:44.654
WE AGREED NOT TO
 THROW YOU OUT ON THE STREET.

19:44.654 --> 19:46.586
SO WE FOUND YOU
 A NICE, LOVING HOME.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.458
HEY, COME ON,
 SLEEPING BEAUTY.

19:48.458 --> 19:51.791
MY TOILET
 ISN´T GONNA PLUNGE ITSELF.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.630
QUESTION NUMBER 21 --

20:00.630 --> 20:03.233
"WHAT WOULD YOU DO
 IF YOU WERE STUCK IN THE WOODS,

20:03.233 --> 20:04.434
AND YOU RUN OUT OF FOOD?"

20:04.434 --> 20:06.906
HMM...I´D EAT YOU.

20:06.906 --> 20:10.980
DAD, THE GUYS
 AREN´T HAVING FUN ANYMORE.

20:10.980 --> 20:12.242
OKAY, I´LL BE RIGHT OUT.

20:12.242 --> 20:13.743
HEY, YOU KNOW...

20:13.743 --> 20:16.716
IT´S REALLY COOL YOU TOOK OVER
 AS MAX´S TROOP LEADER.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.588
WELL, ERNIE,
 IT´S IMPORTANT TO HIM.

20:18.588 --> 20:20.420
SO WHAT IF I HAVE TO
 SACRIFICE MY SUNDAYS?

20:20.420 --> 20:21.521
HE´S MY SON.

20:22.922 --> 20:26.596
I HEARD YOU GUYS
 WEREN´T HAVING FUN ANYMORE.

20:26.596 --> 20:28.698
WELL, SUCK IT UP, RANGERS!

20:28.698 --> 20:30.500
COME ON, GET YOUR BUTTS IN GEAR

20:30.500 --> 20:32.602
IF YOU WANT TO EARN
 THAT YARD-WORKING BADGE.

20:32.602 --> 20:34.464
COME ON -- MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!

20:34.464 --> 20:35.935
COME ON, DIANA ROSS, LET´S GO.

20:37.737 --> 20:47.016
I GOT A 1:00 TEE TIME.
