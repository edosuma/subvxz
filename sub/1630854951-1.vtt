00:51.000 --> 00:53.791
In continuing our chapter
on playing in the post,

00:53.791 --> 00:56.875
this next move is called the slam dunk.

00:56.875 --> 00:58.416
When the player is in close range,

00:58.416 --> 01:03.541
he jumps and throws the ball directly
into the hoop using a dunking motion.

01:03.541 --> 01:05.541
We have Billy here to demonstrate.

01:05.541 --> 01:07.666
Why don't you show us
how it's done, Billy?

01:07.666 --> 01:08.833
Sure, Coach.

01:13.333 --> 01:15.416
Well done. How did that feel?

01:16.041 --> 01:17.125
Really good, Coach.

01:17.708 --> 01:18.666
I'll bet.

01:19.708 --> 01:24.958
It may look simple, but the slam dunk
is rarely used because of its difficulty.

01:24.958 --> 01:28.791
But when it does happen,
it can sure be exciting.

01:33.125 --> 01:35.250
<i>From the free-throw line, he dunks!</i>

01:35.250 --> 01:37.416
What's he gonna do?

01:39.541 --> 01:41.916
Crossover.
He pivots, he pivots, he pivots.

01:44.208 --> 01:46.041
Oh, he splits defenders.

01:53.916 --> 01:55.000
Oh.

01:56.166 --> 01:57.833
<i>Whoa, dude!</i>

01:57.833 --> 01:59.833
- I did it.
-<i>I barely recognize you.</i>

01:59.833 --> 02:00.916
Good, aight?

02:00.916 --> 02:02.708
Freshman Chang is no more.

02:02.708 --> 02:04.708
Chang 2.0 is here, baby.

02:06.166 --> 02:08.708
I'm moving up.
Last year, I was, like, here.

02:08.708 --> 02:12.041
But after this,
I'ma get some more fire clothes,

02:12.041 --> 02:15.333
expand my social media presence,
make a viral video or two.

02:15.333 --> 02:17.125
- Boom, parties.

02:17.125 --> 02:18.833
Boom, girlfriend.

02:18.833 --> 02:20.333
Boom, I'm up here.

02:20.916 --> 02:23.583
-  <i>What if you end up trying too hard?</i>
-  Trying too hard?

02:23.583 --> 02:28.875
You ever think Kobe ever asked himself,
"Gee, I wonder if I'm trying too hard"?

02:29.666 --> 02:31.916
<i>If you wanna get somewhere,
you have to evolve.</i>

02:31.916 --> 02:33.250
<i>All right, so like in</i> Pokémon<i>.</i>

02:33.250 --> 02:34.875
-<i>Like in</i> Pokémon<i>.</i>
- No, no, no, no, no.

02:34.875 --> 02:36.875
-<i>"Charmander, I choose you."</i>
- No.

02:39.166 --> 02:40.541
Kobe.

<i>♪ Then it hit me ♪</i>

02:47.500 --> 02:49.333
Hey, don't touch. Don't-- Just...

02:53.291 --> 02:54.708
- It's weird.

02:59.875 --> 03:00.875
What?

03:01.375 --> 03:03.541
Nothing, it's fine. It's fine. Let's go.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.875
First day of school. Are you nervous?

03:30.625 --> 03:33.333
No. I'm not a freshman, Mom.

03:34.083 --> 03:35.458
- Okay.

03:35.458 --> 03:37.541
Are you coming to the hospital
on Saturday?

03:37.541 --> 03:39.458
Yeah, I was actually thinking about that.

03:40.250 --> 03:43.083
I know volunteering at a hospital is,
like, a good look for colleges,

03:43.083 --> 03:47.791
but most of the other kids
at school have jobs and money.

03:47.791 --> 03:49.500
Why do you need money now?

03:50.500 --> 03:53.333
You'll have lots of money
after you go to a good college.

03:53.333 --> 03:56.791
First of all, that's not necessarily true
in today's economy.

03:56.791 --> 03:57.875
And secondly,

03:57.875 --> 04:01.916
I've heard that having a high school job
better prepares a kid for college success.

04:01.916 --> 04:05.625
Xiao Ming, volunteering was your idea.

04:05.625 --> 04:07.958
You always change your mind.

04:07.958 --> 04:09.791
So find something and stick to it.

04:09.791 --> 04:13.125
I will once I find the right thing.

04:22.250 --> 04:25.041
Good morning to everyone.
Hope everyone had a great summer.

04:25.041 --> 04:26.708
We've got a little basketball drill today.

04:26.708 --> 04:30.458
We got a foul shot, through the cones,
layup on the other side.

04:30.458 --> 04:32.500
You sprint back. Score however you want.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.625
The first team through gets
a pat on the back.

04:34.625 --> 04:37.333
Chang with the lion's mane. I like it.

04:37.333 --> 04:39.416
Hey, why you gotta
swagger-jack Matt though?

04:39.416 --> 04:41.500
-  Don't pick on Chang.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.833
-  Okay. You ready?

04:43.833 --> 04:46.416
All right. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.416
Who's getting down there first? Let's go.

04:49.416 --> 04:50.750
Come on. Layups. Get down.

04:53.041 --> 04:54.500
Oh, man. That was a travel though.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.791
- You gotta dribble the ball.

04:56.791 --> 04:59.041
Go through. Go all the way through.
Go through the cones.

04:59.041 --> 05:01.791
Come on, Jeff. Hit that layup.

05:01.791 --> 05:03.416
Let's go, Maya. Straight back.

05:03.416 --> 05:06.000
All right, come on! Let's shoot down.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.125
Come on, kid. All the way down.
Through the cones!

05:08.125 --> 05:10.750
You got it. Put a little work into it.
A little effort!

05:10.750 --> 05:12.958
All right, here we go, Chang.

05:12.958 --> 05:16.541
Go, Syd. Come on, Syd. Come on.
You can do better than that.

05:16.541 --> 05:19.458
All right, Chang. There you go.
All right, Matt, you're right behind him.

05:19.458 --> 05:21.375
Through the cones. Every cone, every cone.

05:21.375 --> 05:22.625
Come on, Matt. You've got him.

05:22.625 --> 05:24.666
Just a little bit behind him.
Little bit behind.

05:24.666 --> 05:26.541
You've got him. Hit that layup.

05:26.541 --> 05:28.166
There you go. Let's go back.

05:28.791 --> 05:30.875
Let's go, let's go. Come on, Matt.
Come on, Matt.

05:30.875 --> 05:32.833
We got Chang for the three.

05:41.083 --> 05:42.708
-  Oh!

05:42.708 --> 05:44.666
Let's go!
That's what I'm talking about, man.

05:44.666 --> 05:47.500
-  Hey!

05:47.500 --> 05:49.666
- You got up there. Great job.
-  That was awesome.

05:49.666 --> 05:51.916
Hey, guys, great job all around.
All right. Let's go, Chang.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.375
Coach, you gotta put in Chang.

05:53.375 --> 05:55.583
-  Sick.
-  That play was crazy.

05:55.583 --> 05:58.250
Ah, almost, dude. Hey, next time dunk it.

05:58.875 --> 06:00.458
Hey, you kind of cheated though.

06:01.041 --> 06:03.750
Relax, it's gym class.
Stop trying so hard.

06:27.458 --> 06:28.750
Okay. Okay.

06:29.958 --> 06:33.000
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.750
-  Oh, my god.

06:34.750 --> 06:37.833
- It's like band camp didn't even happen.
- What happened with the hair?

06:37.833 --> 06:40.708
-  Didn't even happen.
-  I wasn't feeling it.

06:40.708 --> 06:43.500
Ah, man, I was hoping
you'd stick with it for at least a day.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.958
Yeah, I will. When I find the right cut.

06:46.833 --> 06:48.416
Chang!

06:53.166 --> 06:56.416
Chang, uh, this is Kristy.
She's gonna be our new snare player.

06:57.583 --> 06:58.625
Sup?

07:03.750 --> 07:05.458
Chang? Hello?

07:06.250 --> 07:07.250
Uh, sorry.

07:07.250 --> 07:09.791
I need you to take her
to the storage locker and get her a kit.

07:09.791 --> 07:11.083
All right? Set her up?

07:11.708 --> 07:13.791
- Uh, kit, yeah, yeah. Kit.
-  Thank you.

07:13.791 --> 07:16.041
Okay, band!
Instruments up. Instruments up.

07:16.041 --> 07:18.333
We're gonna take it
from the top of the song.

07:20.166 --> 07:23.791
Wow. You guys take this pretty seriously.

07:23.791 --> 07:27.250
Oh, yeah. In case you didn't notice,
Mr. Ryan is a bit intense.

07:28.250 --> 07:29.750
Intense is good.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.625
Means you're passionate about something.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.750
Oh, yeah, totally, same.

07:40.041 --> 07:41.791
- Got it?
- Yeah, I got it.

07:43.625 --> 07:44.875
Here, let me help.

07:49.458 --> 07:50.750
You play a lot?

07:51.458 --> 07:52.458
I do.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.750
Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, the Beatles.
I mean, they're classic.

08:02.750 --> 08:03.958
- So good.
- What about you?

08:03.958 --> 08:05.750
- You into rock?
- Oh... [scoffs] ...yeah.

08:05.750 --> 08:07.708
- Who do you like?
- Uh...

08:07.708 --> 08:10.208
Metallica. [scoffs] I love Metallica.

08:10.208 --> 08:11.416
- They're my faves.
- Okay.

08:11.416 --> 08:13.916
- Yeah, you like them, right?
- Ah, they're all right.

08:13.916 --> 08:15.541
I'm not big into favorites though, so...

08:15.541 --> 08:17.041
Oh, yeah, yeah, me either.

08:17.041 --> 08:18.708
I mean, why compare?

08:18.708 --> 08:20.375
Every band is, like, special, you know?

08:20.375 --> 08:21.458
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

08:21.458 --> 08:24.875
Oh, shoot. I just-- I forgot to lock up.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.541
- Wait a second? All right?
- Okay.

08:26.541 --> 08:28.625
- Just-- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

08:41.291 --> 08:43.583
Game time, baby. Let's go.

08:52.041 --> 08:55.000
Anyway, so we were playing this
nationally ranked team from out of state,

08:55.000 --> 08:56.458
and Drake was at the last game.

08:56.458 --> 08:57.583
- Sick.
- Yeah.

08:57.583 --> 08:59.125
I mean, the energy's gonna be crazy.

08:59.125 --> 09:01.000
You, uh-- You don't want to miss it.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.500
Hey, Matt.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.375
Uh. What's up?

09:05.375 --> 09:08.083
Uh, this is Kristy. She's-- She's new.

09:08.708 --> 09:11.125
- Uh, yeah. I-I know.
- Yeah.

09:11.125 --> 09:13.916
-  We should get back actually.
-  Okay.

09:15.625 --> 09:18.583
Uh, wait.
So, Saturday, you coming?

09:18.583 --> 09:20.416
- Um...
-  What's on Saturday?

09:20.416 --> 09:22.291
<i>We're supposed
to volunteer on Saturday.</i>

09:22.291 --> 09:23.916
Bro, this is way more important.

09:23.916 --> 09:26.041
- Yo, Kristy and I were vibing, all right?

09:26.041 --> 09:28.083
Dude, she's legit the best drummer
I've ever seen.

09:28.083 --> 09:29.500
And she's into '90s rock.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.000
<i>Since when are you into '90s rock?</i>

09:31.000 --> 09:33.958
Since today.
Yo, what's your Spotify password again?

09:33.958 --> 09:37.166
<i>It's "Itachididnothingwrong."
It's one word, all lowercase.</i>

09:37.166 --> 09:38.625
<i>What are you gonna do about Matt?</i>

09:38.625 --> 09:40.500
<i>He's got his beautiful blue eyes on her.</i>

09:40.500 --> 09:43.750
I don't think he's her type.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.708
<i>Try saying that when he's flying
through the air like a Greek god.</i>

09:49.541 --> 09:51.875
- Yeah, I'll-- I'll handle him.
-<i>You'll handle him?</i>

09:55.750 --> 09:58.208
Oh, shoot. I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later?

09:58.208 --> 09:59.541
<i>All right. See ya.</i>

10:03.250 --> 10:05.333

-  Ref!

10:43.958 --> 10:45.208
- There's no hard foul?
- Please!

10:45.208 --> 10:48.166
It's okay, honey.
This ref is an idiot. He's an idiot!

10:48.166 --> 10:49.375

10:57.541 --> 10:59.125

10:59.125 --> 11:01.166
You seem pretty into basketball?

11:01.166 --> 11:03.083
Oh, yeah. I'm a huge basketball-head.

11:03.083 --> 11:05.541
I used to spend, like,
five hours a day at the park.

11:05.541 --> 11:08.041
Really? Why aren't you out there then?

11:09.083 --> 11:13.083
Uh, 'cause I swore a blood oath
to Mr. Ryan.

11:13.083 --> 11:15.333
- Now all my free time goes to the band.

11:16.958 --> 11:18.708
-  All right, come on.

11:18.708 --> 11:20.333
-  I got it!
-  By the way,

11:20.333 --> 11:21.916
there's this sick music shop in town,

11:21.916 --> 11:24.166
and I heard they got
some new kits yesterday.

11:24.833 --> 11:26.250
- Tamas.
- Really?

11:26.250 --> 11:28.833
Yeah.
It's what Lars Ulrich plays on, right?

11:28.833 --> 11:30.916
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.333

Anyway, if you want, maybe sometime
we can, you know, go and make some--

11:39.541 --> 11:42.166
Kristy! Hey, you made it.

11:43.291 --> 11:44.458
This is for you.

11:45.583 --> 11:48.791
- Here we go, Matt. Come on.
-  Let's go, Havoc!

11:48.791 --> 11:50.625
- Let's go!
-  Havoc!

11:51.708 --> 11:53.125
All right. Come on.

12:03.125 --> 12:04.125
Damn it!

12:31.541 --> 12:33.791
- I mean, the energy's gonna be crazy.

13:16.333 --> 13:19.291
Yeah. These mostly school people?

13:19.291 --> 13:20.500
Uh, yeah.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.583
Oh. Sup, Todd?

13:23.666 --> 13:25.958
-  So loud in here.
- Right. Right.

13:28.166 --> 13:29.333
Uh, this way.

13:37.375 --> 13:38.375
Wow.

13:39.291 --> 13:40.333
What a shrine.

13:40.333 --> 13:41.416
Yeah.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.083
You know, he scored 62 points that game.

13:47.083 --> 13:48.166
In three quarters.

13:49.333 --> 13:50.666
And he could have had more,

13:50.666 --> 13:53.583
but they were already up by 34,
so Phil Jackson took him out.

13:53.583 --> 13:54.666
Out of mercy.

13:55.958 --> 13:59.208
So, he's, like, your favorite player?

14:01.750 --> 14:03.166
Kobe's my hero 'cause...

14:04.708 --> 14:06.625
he saw every obstacle as an opportunity.

14:07.541 --> 14:11.416
Every challenge put in front of him,
he saw as a way to improve.

14:13.333 --> 14:16.833
He could face anything,
'cause he wasn't afraid.

14:17.500 --> 14:18.500
What about you?

14:20.666 --> 14:21.666
You afraid?

14:24.333 --> 14:25.166
Hey, Kristy.

14:26.125 --> 14:28.958
What are you doing in here?
I've been looking everywhere for you.

14:28.958 --> 14:30.916
I wanna introduce you
to a couple of my friends.

14:30.916 --> 14:35.541
Um. Yeah. Yeah. Um. Yeah, okay.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.416
All right.

14:43.458 --> 14:45.708
Chang, who invited you?

14:45.708 --> 14:47.958
- Uh, I was--
- We're just playing.

14:47.958 --> 14:49.833
We're playing <i>2K</i>. We need another player.

14:49.833 --> 14:52.458
- No, I-I need to go look--
- Ah, come on, man.

14:52.458 --> 14:53.625
Real quick.

14:54.875 --> 14:56.500
I don't really feel like playing now.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.125
- I gotta go back--
-  Have fun, bro.

14:58.125 --> 15:00.208
- Hey! Hey!
-  Have fun, bro.

15:00.208 --> 15:02.375
- Yo, what the hell? Guys?

15:02.375 --> 15:03.750
Not cool, man.

15:11.125 --> 15:12.833
- Hey, Timmy.
-  Wanna play?

15:12.833 --> 15:14.541
Not right now. You got big.

15:15.166 --> 15:16.291
You look the same.

15:25.875 --> 15:27.833
Matt! I'm gonna--

15:30.500 --> 15:33.250
Okay. What would Kobe do?

15:52.291 --> 15:53.375
Ew.

15:55.208 --> 15:57.250
-  What the...
-  Didn't you lock the door?

15:57.250 --> 15:58.625
The dream school's gotta be Duke.

15:58.625 --> 16:02.125
It's literally got everything.
It's got the history, the culture, like--

16:02.125 --> 16:04.000
Hey, guys. Hey.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.583
- Where'd you go?

16:05.583 --> 16:08.083
Oh, I made a wrong turn somewhere
and ended up in the basement.

16:08.083 --> 16:11.458
- Yeah. Wild, right?

16:12.000 --> 16:13.416
Oh, great game today, man.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.375
Super clutch.

16:16.375 --> 16:17.458
- Thanks.
-  Yeah.

16:17.458 --> 16:21.916
Yeah. Uh, look, we were kinda having,
like, a private convo here, so...

16:21.916 --> 16:24.166
Oh, really? Yeah, about what?

16:25.166 --> 16:28.708
About where Matt would like
to go play college ball.

16:29.333 --> 16:31.958
Wow. Hey, you got your offers in already?

16:31.958 --> 16:33.500
Chang, I'm just gonna be straight up.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.958
You're, uh--
You're kinda messing with the vibe.

16:37.416 --> 16:39.375
- I mean, do you really think--
- This is dumb.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.541
Matt, you're just, like, so cool, right?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.375
Facts.

16:47.375 --> 16:48.916
Okay, okay, but why?

16:48.916 --> 16:52.083
Is-- Is it 'cause you got nice 'fits,
and a nice house?

16:52.083 --> 16:54.166
You're like the human version
of a poached egg.

16:54.166 --> 16:55.750
Oh, okay. Yeah, you can dunk.

16:55.750 --> 16:57.416
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's pretty cool.

16:57.416 --> 17:00.250
But whoop-de-do, all right?
So can a lot of people.

17:02.625 --> 17:05.375
Let's go, Kristy. Come on. Kristy?

17:07.250 --> 17:08.375
You can't.

17:09.041 --> 17:10.416
Yeah, I could if I tried.

17:10.416 --> 17:11.708
Uh, no, you couldn't.

17:12.791 --> 17:14.875
I mean-- Hey, guys,
I-I just have a question.

17:14.875 --> 17:17.583
Just curious,
who here thinks Chang can dunk?

17:20.458 --> 17:21.708
I-I could if I tried.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.291
- No, you couldn't.
- Yes, I could.

17:24.916 --> 17:25.916
Come on.

17:25.916 --> 17:30.125
I mean, you could try as hard as you like
but, uh, yeah, you are never dunking.

17:30.125 --> 17:31.208
Okay, says who?

17:31.916 --> 17:35.083
- Uh, says everyone, like...

17:36.958 --> 17:39.916
Why not? Huh? Why not?

17:41.041 --> 17:44.625
-  Ooh. We got a Chang overboard.

17:44.625 --> 17:46.875
- Yeah!

17:47.958 --> 17:50.250
- You wanna see a dunk?
-  Yeah.

17:51.458 --> 17:53.500
-  That's it.
-  Here he comes.

17:57.291 --> 17:59.083
That's what I'm talking about.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.166
Yeah, man. Let's go!

18:03.875 --> 18:05.166
Thank you, Mrs. O'Neil.

18:05.166 --> 18:06.666
Not at all. Good seeing you.

18:06.666 --> 18:09.875
It's been so long since you've come by
the house and hung out with Matt.

18:16.708 --> 18:17.791
Hi, Chen.

18:18.458 --> 18:19.750
Hey, Susan.

18:19.750 --> 18:22.000
Uh, I-I'm so sorry to worry you like this.

18:22.000 --> 18:26.208
Matt had some friends over
after the game. They lost track of time.

18:29.250 --> 18:30.250
You're wet.

18:30.250 --> 18:32.333
Yeah.
They were horsing around,

18:32.333 --> 18:34.083
and Chang fell in the pool.

18:34.083 --> 18:35.166
You know how boys are.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.208
I did already.

18:38.208 --> 18:40.375
-  Good night.
-  Good night.

18:40.375 --> 18:41.833
- Thank you.
-  Thank you.

18:41.833 --> 18:43.166
Bye, Chen.

18:48.291 --> 18:49.291
 I'm sorry.

18:49.291 --> 18:51.833
Matt invited me to his big game,
so I wanted to be supportive.

18:55.916 --> 18:57.041
It was an accident.

19:01.375 --> 19:03.958
-  I'll pay for a new one.
- You don't have money.

19:03.958 --> 19:05.791
Yeah, because you won't let me get a job.

19:09.875 --> 19:11.166
Someone pushed you?

19:12.375 --> 19:14.291
No. Why would you even say that?

19:14.291 --> 19:16.625
I'm your mother. I know when you're upset.

19:16.625 --> 19:18.250
Well, I'm not, okay?

19:23.250 --> 19:25.000
<i>Says who?</i>

19:25.000 --> 19:27.666
<i>Uh, says everyone, like...</i>

20:30.666 --> 20:32.208
Hey! Matt!

20:32.208 --> 20:34.583
- Yo, you trippin', man.
-  Hey, shut up, sidekick.

20:34.583 --> 20:36.291
- What you say, man?
-  Hey, hey, hey.

20:36.291 --> 20:37.708
Let me handle this, man.

20:42.791 --> 20:44.083
What's good, Chang?

20:44.083 --> 20:47.083
You said I couldn't dunk?
I bet you I could.

20:47.083 --> 20:48.458
- What?

20:48.458 --> 20:50.500
Dude, you're still on this?

20:50.500 --> 20:51.583
Yeah.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.500
On the night
of the last home football game,

20:53.500 --> 20:55.833
I bet you I will dunk
on that hoop right there.

20:57.916 --> 21:00.458
-  Okay.
-  Wait, sorry. You're serious?

21:00.458 --> 21:02.583
- You actually--
- Yeah. I'm afraid so.

21:03.416 --> 21:06.250
Wow. That is, uh, that's straight up
the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

21:06.250 --> 21:08.291
Not as dumb as your face
after I dunk on it.

21:10.333 --> 21:12.291
What? What?

21:13.375 --> 21:15.541
Okay, Chang, look.
If you want it, you can have it, bud.

21:15.541 --> 21:17.125
What are we putting down?

21:17.125 --> 21:20.000
Loser has to shave their head.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.333
Bro, that's it?

21:22.125 --> 21:24.083
- Boo!

21:24.083 --> 21:25.666
- Boo!
-  Do something else!

21:25.666 --> 21:27.625
Dude, nobody cares
if you shave your head, Chang.

21:27.625 --> 21:29.750
-  Yeah.
- Fine. Let's raise the stakes then.

21:30.458 --> 21:32.250
- Your Kobe jersey.
-  Matt!

21:32.250 --> 21:35.625
- Dude, no way.
- Oh. What? You shook?

21:35.625 --> 21:37.708
Man, you have nothing that I want.

21:37.708 --> 21:40.625
I have a first edition
Charizard Pokémon card.

21:40.625 --> 21:41.833
- Shadowless.

21:41.833 --> 21:45.333
-  Shadowless, bro.
- Yeah. He knows what that is.

21:45.333 --> 21:46.833
Worth three grand. Minimum.

21:46.833 --> 21:49.416
- Yeah!

21:49.416 --> 21:51.833
-  Let's go!
-  Yeah!

21:52.833 --> 21:53.833
Whoo!

21:57.541 --> 22:00.125
- Got yourself a deal, my friend.
-  Yo!

22:02.166 --> 22:05.375
- Bro, everybody's talking about you, dude.
- Really? What are they saying?

22:05.375 --> 22:08.125
Uh, that you let stinky Matt
know what's up, man.

22:08.125 --> 22:10.583
I'm proud of you, dude.
The-- The Charizard?

22:10.583 --> 22:12.166
- Yo, I had no choice.

22:12.166 --> 22:16.833
Yo. Look, I just got here.
I-I don't wanna be in some drama.

22:16.833 --> 22:18.250
You're absolutely right.

22:18.958 --> 22:21.791
I'm so sorry. Saturday must have been
so awkward for you.

22:22.458 --> 22:25.166
So, this bet thing has nothing
to do with me, right?

22:25.166 --> 22:28.166
No. No, no, no, no.
It's between me and Matt.

22:28.166 --> 22:29.666
We-- We go way back.

22:30.541 --> 22:31.541
Okay.

22:32.583 --> 22:34.375
Apology accepted.

22:35.916 --> 22:38.416
That being said,
I have ten bucks on you dunking.

22:38.416 --> 22:39.708
I don't like to lose money.

22:40.291 --> 22:43.708
- Oh. Uh...

22:44.583 --> 22:46.583
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

22:46.583 --> 22:48.416
Hey, don't worry! My man's got this!

22:48.416 --> 22:49.750
- I got this!
-  Okay.

22:54.333 --> 22:56.500
Yo, so this guy has
this bulking program.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.375
I'm gonna copy exactly what he's doing,
and then I'm gonna double it.

22:59.375 --> 23:01.666
-<i>♪ Yeah, and you're not ♪</i>

23:01.666 --> 23:03.708
<i>♪ Bad B

23:03.708 --> 23:06.000
All right. Minus 1,700...

23:06.000 --> 23:07.500
- I saw this on a TV show once.
- What?

23:07.500 --> 23:09.708
-  You got me?
- Yeah, I got you.

23:09.708 --> 23:11.416
-  You sure?
- No, I got you.

23:12.875 --> 23:14.583
- You know what I need?
-  What?

23:14.583 --> 23:15.666
An alter ego.

23:15.666 --> 23:17.416
-  Yeah. Yeah!
- Like The Black Mamba.

23:17.416 --> 23:20.375
Like a--
Like a cool color and then an animal.

23:20.375 --> 23:22.750
Sixty-eight, 69, 70.

23:22.750 --> 23:23.708
Seventy-- Let's go.

23:23.708 --> 23:25.125
You can be The Green Frog.

23:25.125 --> 23:27.583
I like the thematic relevance,
but how about something cooler?

23:27.583 --> 23:30.666
- What's cooler than a frog? They jump.
- I got it. The Brown Kangaroo.

23:30.666 --> 23:32.916
- No. [laughs] That sucks.
-  The Brown Kangaroo.

23:35.375 --> 23:37.291
Yes, the Flea,
because proportional to its body size...

23:37.291 --> 23:39.500
- I don't like bugs.
- ...the flea jumps higher than any animal.

23:39.500 --> 23:42.000
So, if you were a flea,
you'd be dunking on a hundred-foot rim.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.541
- You're making that up.
- You'd be dunking on a hundred-foot rim!

23:44.541 --> 23:47.666
- You're making that up.
- I read books, pal. Try it sometime.

23:47.666 --> 23:50.458
- Technique. Whoo! Ten more.

23:50.458 --> 23:53.333
- A grasshopper is an insect!
- But it's, like, a cool insect.

23:53.333 --> 23:54.416
Ten more!

23:54.416 --> 23:56.333
I got it. The Red Panda.

23:57.208 --> 23:58.500
Do pandas jump?

23:58.500 --> 24:00.375
Not at all. It's ironic.

24:00.375 --> 24:02.708
<i>♪ She got a big bad dumper

24:02.708 --> 24:05.208
Four.

24:05.208 --> 24:09.791
- I like it. I like it. Yo, The Red Panda.
-  Yeah. Yeah! Red Panda!

24:09.791 --> 24:11.875
- The Red Panda.
- Red Panda.

24:11.875 --> 24:16.083
I am Chang, The Red Panda.

24:16.875 --> 24:19.416

24:19.416 --> 24:21.791
- Yeah!

24:21.791 --> 24:23.583

- No, it's more like a quarter of that.
- Two feet?

24:34.583 --> 24:36.000
Small steps.

24:52.458 --> 24:53.833
Ah!

25:08.000 --> 25:10.416
Sup, nerd? How do you feel? Better?

25:11.666 --> 25:15.958
No. Yo, is this what being old feels like?
'Cause it sucks.

25:15.958 --> 25:17.208
What's that?

25:17.958 --> 25:19.083
Deer jerky.

25:19.083 --> 25:20.916
They're, like,

25:23.250 --> 25:25.250
- Want some?
- Duh. Gimme.

25:28.083 --> 25:29.750
Yeah, I barely added an inch.

25:29.750 --> 25:32.416
- It's been, like, one week.
- I know. When is it gonna start working?

25:32.416 --> 25:33.916
Dunking yet?

25:35.333 --> 25:36.750
Uh...

25:37.375 --> 25:40.958
No. But, you know,
it's a process, and I trust it.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.041
Okay.

25:44.041 --> 25:47.083
Well, if you're not busy, um...

25:48.333 --> 25:50.916
need a new pair of sticks.
You said you know a place, right?

25:51.583 --> 25:53.416
Yeah. Yeah.

25:53.416 --> 25:56.541
Cool. Did you wanna...

25:57.250 --> 26:00.875
You-- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Uh, I'll meet you over there.

26:00.875 --> 26:03.250
- Yeah, absolutely. Okay.
- Okay. Cool. Yep.

26:06.791 --> 26:07.750
Dude.

26:07.750 --> 26:09.458
Defense wins championships.

26:09.458 --> 26:12.250
In three years, they're gonna be
in the championship. Guaranteed.

26:12.250 --> 26:14.750
I'm telling you.
I can feel it in my bones.

26:14.750 --> 26:16.750
- I'm telling you. I can feel it.

26:16.750 --> 26:18.458
- Chang.
-  Hey, guys.

26:18.458 --> 26:19.708
You must be Kristy.

26:19.708 --> 26:20.875
Hi.

26:20.875 --> 26:22.291
Go on. Have fun.

26:22.291 --> 26:23.583
Thanks, Lenny.

26:24.958 --> 26:27.291
Yeah, I just told them
I was gonna bring some people.

26:27.916 --> 26:29.375
- Right.
- Oh.

26:36.833 --> 26:37.833
Hey.

26:44.083 --> 26:45.083
Wow.

26:45.958 --> 26:46.958
Sick, right?

26:48.208 --> 26:49.875
Tama's one of my dad's faves.

26:50.500 --> 26:51.500
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:51.500 --> 26:53.250
- Is he a drummer?
- Oh, yeah.

26:53.750 --> 26:55.458
He was in two bands growing up.

26:55.458 --> 26:56.708
He was nice.

26:56.708 --> 26:58.041
Did he teach you how to play?

26:58.666 --> 26:59.833
Not at first.

27:01.416 --> 27:05.750
Believe it or not,
I, uh... learned by playing <i>Rock Band</i>.

27:05.750 --> 27:08.041
-  The video game?
- Yeah.

27:08.041 --> 27:10.041
He saw me spending so much time on it,

27:10.041 --> 27:13.833
and I guess he just thought I needed
to learn how to play in real life.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.000
Sounds like a cool dad.

27:16.250 --> 27:17.250
He was.

27:18.375 --> 27:20.166
He, um, passed.

27:21.166 --> 27:22.291
Cancer.

27:23.291 --> 27:26.666
Oh, uh... I'm sorry.

27:27.666 --> 27:30.208
Don't be. It happens.

27:30.958 --> 27:32.875
Well, I bet he'd be really proud of you.

27:34.625 --> 27:36.625
'Cause you're really, really good.

27:38.375 --> 27:39.375
Thanks.

27:43.458 --> 27:46.416
What about you?
Your dad teach you anything cool?

27:46.416 --> 27:50.875
Uh, basketball, I guess.
Yeah, he's a huge basketball fan.

27:50.875 --> 27:53.125
Mm-hmm. So that's why you wanna dunk.

27:53.125 --> 27:56.875
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh, he'd probably think it's pretty cool.

27:58.083 --> 28:00.208
But I actually don't get
to see him that much.

28:00.875 --> 28:02.291
My parents are kinda separated.

28:04.208 --> 28:05.541
Oh.

28:05.541 --> 28:06.958
It happens.

28:08.375 --> 28:12.000
I'm pretty sure they'll get bored
and get back together eventually.

28:13.041 --> 28:15.333
And in the meantime,
I still got basketball.

28:16.958 --> 28:19.166
So, are you gonna try out
for the team then?

28:19.875 --> 28:21.791
Uh, nah.

28:21.791 --> 28:24.125
I mean, everyone already knows
who's gonna make the team.

28:24.125 --> 28:26.250
And I'd just ride the bench.

28:26.250 --> 28:27.750
I just wanna be a baller.

28:28.375 --> 28:30.125
But you'd still be you.

28:31.291 --> 28:32.583
I-- Yep.

28:32.583 --> 28:36.208
"Every obstacle is an opportunity."

28:36.208 --> 28:38.791
- I knew you were gonna say that.

28:44.083 --> 28:46.375
Do you wanna hear something
my dad taught me?

28:48.041 --> 28:49.041
Hell yeah.

29:01.625 --> 29:04.083
- Boom.
- It is a great multivitamin.

29:05.375 --> 29:08.375
This bar tastes better
than every single other bar.

29:08.375 --> 29:09.916
<i>What up, Hoopers? It's HoopsieDaisy.</i>

29:09.916 --> 29:13.041
<i>You guys know I've always wanted to dunk,
and I've tried the diets.</i>

29:13.041 --> 29:15.458
<i>I've tried the jumping workouts.
The weird contraptions.</i>

29:15.458 --> 29:18.250
<i>Nothing's worked,
but I finally found the solution.</i>

29:18.250 --> 29:20.583
<i>Boom! These are the Vert Boost 99s.</i>

29:20.583 --> 29:23.083
-<i>If you wanna dunk, you need to buy these.</i>

29:23.083 --> 29:24.875
<i>Hit the link down below in the description</i>

29:24.875 --> 29:28.375

29:28.375 --> 29:29.583
<i>I got y'all.</i>

29:35.666 --> 29:37.750
<i>Huh?
What way do you want me to go?</i>

29:37.750 --> 29:40.375
-<i>What way do you want me to go?</i>

29:40.375 --> 29:43.208
-  <i>Yeah. I'm him. I'm him.</i>
-  <i>Mine, yep. Oh, yeah.</i>

29:43.208 --> 29:44.583
<i>You see that?</i>

29:45.458 --> 29:46.458
<i>Oh.</i>

29:47.916 --> 29:49.291
<i>Did I do that?</i>

29:51.541 --> 29:55.500
<i>According to my calculations,
the elevator's going up and coming down!</i>

29:55.500 --> 29:57.875
<i>Is everybody okay? Is everybody all right?</i>

29:57.875 --> 29:59.375
<i>Good game, man.</i>

29:59.375 --> 30:01.458
<i>Oh, baseline. Oh, yeah.</i>

30:01.458 --> 30:04.000
<i>Did I do that?</i>

30:04.000 --> 30:05.875
Dude, who edited this?
This is amateur.

30:05.875 --> 30:07.625
Yo,
who cares about the filmmaking?

30:07.625 --> 30:09.041
- He's hooping in cosplay.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.583
And he lives two towns over.

30:10.583 --> 30:12.500
Well, he's got less than
a thousand subscribers.

30:12.500 --> 30:15.916
- Couldn't you ask someone more legit?
- I did, all right? They all ignored me.

30:15.916 --> 30:19.125
Apparently, he played overseas.
He's a two-time Estonian League MVP.

30:19.125 --> 30:22.250
Okay, I guess. So, what's the plan?

30:23.291 --> 30:25.791
I'm meeting him at the Galleria today.

30:25.791 --> 30:28.458
When? Better be after our shift.

30:28.458 --> 30:31.125
- Uh...
-  Dude!

30:31.125 --> 30:32.833
Come on.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.833
You're gonna get
into all the good colleges.

30:35.833 --> 30:38.833
Uh-huh, yeah, as well as be a good person
who likes to help other people.

30:38.833 --> 30:40.500
- Hmm.

30:42.291 --> 30:44.291
How are you gonna get there?
The Galleria's far.

30:44.291 --> 30:45.750
My mom's giving me a ride.

30:45.750 --> 30:49.166
I still need to get my phone, so
I told her all the best deals are there.

30:49.791 --> 30:51.541
All right.

30:52.541 --> 30:53.875
Good luck, buddy.

30:53.875 --> 30:55.958
-  "Good luck, buddy."

31:02.291 --> 31:04.375
Well, can't you go
during your lunch break?

31:05.333 --> 31:07.041
-  No.
- You haven't started your rounds.

31:07.041 --> 31:08.125
I know that.

31:08.125 --> 31:10.708
You can go. Great.
We'll figure it out. Just...

31:10.708 --> 31:13.166
-  Tomorrow I'll come in early.
- Go, Chen. Thank you.

31:13.166 --> 31:15.250
-  Sorry.
- Am I wrong? No?

31:36.541 --> 31:38.250
Is everything okay?

31:38.250 --> 31:40.666
Why did we have to come this far?

31:40.666 --> 31:43.958
I told you, there are better deals
at the store here.

31:43.958 --> 31:46.166
Your phone's still expensive.

31:53.250 --> 31:54.750
It was an accident.

31:57.500 --> 31:59.458
It's okay. It's nothing.

32:01.375 --> 32:02.666
I can take the bus home.

32:03.333 --> 32:05.875
You can just drop me off. If that helps.

32:17.166 --> 32:19.041
I thought about what you said.

32:20.041 --> 32:21.916
I'm going to start sticking with things.

32:23.083 --> 32:24.083
I promise.

32:30.291 --> 32:31.333
Okay.

32:43.750 --> 32:46.958
Ah. My mans right here got good taste.

32:46.958 --> 32:48.958
I wish, man. I can't afford this.

32:48.958 --> 32:52.166
Oh. My brother, that's a easy wish.

32:52.666 --> 32:55.208
Yeah, get yourself a solid job
with some good commission,

32:55.208 --> 32:59.041
and you'll be sending honeys 8K selfies
with a Leica lens in no time.

32:59.041 --> 33:00.416
No time at all.

33:00.416 --> 33:02.583
Coincidentally,
we're hiring if you want an app.

33:03.541 --> 33:04.541
Deandre?

33:04.541 --> 33:07.375
Oh, shoot. Do we know each other?
I owe you money or something?

33:07.375 --> 33:09.958
I DMed you.
We were supposed to meet at 2:00?

33:09.958 --> 33:12.500
Oh, right. Yeah, you're the kid
who wants to learn how to dunk.

33:12.500 --> 33:14.041
You said you were a basketball coach.

33:14.041 --> 33:16.625
I am. You said you were 6'0''.

33:16.625 --> 33:19.208
- This is dumb.

33:19.208 --> 33:22.583
Yo, yo. Come on, man. I'm sorry, okay?

33:22.583 --> 33:25.333
We got off on the wrong foot.
Let's try this again.

33:26.333 --> 33:28.291
I'm Deandre Cooke.

33:28.291 --> 33:29.875
Chang, right?

33:29.875 --> 33:30.958
Yeah.

33:32.208 --> 33:34.583
Yeah, okay. Nice to meet you.

33:34.583 --> 33:37.291
So, how much height do we need?

33:44.958 --> 33:46.750
Just raise it back up when you're done.

33:47.375 --> 33:49.583
Oops. Ah. Too far.

33:52.916 --> 33:55.000
Now this guy here's a county legend.

33:55.708 --> 33:56.875
Buckets Cooke.

34:01.416 --> 34:02.708
You listen to him.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.166
Thanks, Mr. J.

34:11.291 --> 34:12.291
Yikes. Okay.

34:12.291 --> 34:15.625
Well, first of all,
your jump mechanics need work.

34:15.625 --> 34:19.083
Right? You're not really generating
much power from here or here.

34:19.083 --> 34:20.958
Also, you're only bringing
the ball halfway up,

34:20.958 --> 34:22.375
so why are you cheating yourself?

34:22.375 --> 34:24.916
Full extension, okay? Let's try it.

34:30.416 --> 34:33.708
- Oh, oh, oh! Holy crap!
-  Oh! That was, like, six inches!

34:33.708 --> 34:35.375
So, do you think I could dunk?

34:35.375 --> 34:37.166
- You probably still growing, right?
- Mm-hmm.

34:37.166 --> 34:39.041
So, if you stay consistent
with your workouts,

34:39.041 --> 34:41.833
in about a half a year to a year,
I don't see why not.

34:41.833 --> 34:43.916
Uh, I need to do it in ten weeks.

34:43.916 --> 34:45.375
- Say what now?
- Yeah.

34:45.375 --> 34:48.333
It's a long story, but if Chang can't dunk
by our last football game,

34:48.333 --> 34:50.000
he's gonna have to move to another school.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.916
I'll do anything you ask me to do.
Please. Just help me out.

34:52.916 --> 34:54.333
- Ten weeks?
- Mm-hmm.

34:54.333 --> 34:55.833
Okay. So, let's see.

34:55.833 --> 34:59.125
In ten weeks, we're definitely gonna
have to do some one-on-ones.

34:59.125 --> 35:03.208
Uh, some weight training.
No doubt. Uh, plyo.

35:03.208 --> 35:05.916
- Uh, technique for sure.
- Yeah.

35:06.750 --> 35:08.166
- How much you paying?
- What?

35:09.416 --> 35:10.708
How much--

35:10.708 --> 35:11.958
- What?
- Uh...

35:11.958 --> 35:16.000
My man, if you're trying to dunk a ball
in ten weeks, we gotta do it right. Okay?

35:16.000 --> 35:19.083
That means mornings, evenings,
Saturdays and Sundays.

35:19.083 --> 35:21.291
- I can't do all that for free.
- I don't have any money.

35:21.291 --> 35:23.458
What are you talking about?
I just sold you a top-shelf phone.

35:23.458 --> 35:25.041
Yeah, that costed all my savings.

35:25.041 --> 35:28.166
I'll return it, all right?
But that's all I got, all right?

35:28.166 --> 35:30.791
- How about that?
- Look, I'm sorry, bro. Okay?

35:30.791 --> 35:32.458
I really am, but I-I just can't.

35:32.458 --> 35:35.041
It's not gonna cut it. Okay?

35:35.958 --> 35:37.333
Good luck with your new school.

35:37.333 --> 35:38.708
What do you shoot on?

35:39.750 --> 35:42.000
- I'm sorry?
- For your videos. What do you shoot on?

35:42.958 --> 35:45.125
- My phone.
- Your phone? Yeah.

35:45.125 --> 35:48.250
And then you just edit everything
on what? Let me guess, iMovie?

35:49.375 --> 35:52.833
Mm-hmm. Okay, so, if I were you, I'd be
investing in a gimbal at least, right?

35:52.833 --> 35:54.458
'Cause you've got a basketball channel.

35:54.458 --> 35:57.291
You're shooting everything locked down
from 30 feet back like it's 1920.

35:57.291 --> 35:59.375
Okay? Get us in on the action.

35:59.375 --> 36:01.708
All right? Don't get me started
on that fake slow-motion.

36:01.708 --> 36:04.166
You have to get that in-camera
with a high frame rate.

36:04.666 --> 36:06.833
Come on, man. Where's the mise-en-scène?

36:07.625 --> 36:10.958
Look here, little man.
I work hard on my videos, okay?

36:10.958 --> 36:12.625
Yes, I bet you do.

36:12.625 --> 36:16.500
I bet you do, and I also bet you're
only achieving about 50% of your vision.

36:18.375 --> 36:19.916
So, what are you proposing?

36:19.916 --> 36:21.791
You get Chang dunking like--

36:21.791 --> 36:23.541
- Who's, uh...
- Vince Carter.

36:23.541 --> 36:25.416
- You get Chang dunking like Vince Carter...
- Mmm.

36:25.416 --> 36:27.625
...I'll get your channel
looking like Scorsese.

36:28.750 --> 36:29.750
Michael Bay.

36:29.750 --> 36:31.000
Michael Bay?

36:31.000 --> 36:32.333
Yes, Michael Bay.

36:33.208 --> 36:34.291
Mm-hmm.

36:36.666 --> 36:38.625
And he's gotta be in the videos.

36:38.625 --> 36:39.916
What, me? Why?

36:39.916 --> 36:46.041
Because if I can get you,
and I mean all of you, to dunk...

36:46.041 --> 36:48.041
...everybody's gonna be hittin' me up.

36:49.791 --> 36:50.958
So, we got a deal?

36:55.416 --> 36:56.583
You want Michael Bay?

36:58.708 --> 37:00.708
I'll get you Michael Benjamin Bay.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.083
Y'all ain't never shake
nobody's hand before?

37:16.541 --> 37:18.500
Now walk off, walk off, walk off.

37:20.958 --> 37:22.125
How'd that look? Good?

37:22.125 --> 37:27.708
So when I say I'm filming in slow-motion,
you don't also have to move in slow-mo.

37:27.708 --> 37:29.125
Oh.

37:29.708 --> 37:31.458
Wait. You sure it don't look better?

37:31.458 --> 37:32.750
No.

37:32.750 --> 37:33.833
Okay.

37:34.833 --> 37:37.083
Wow! Good morning, sunshine.

37:37.083 --> 37:39.791
Look who decided to join us.
Get him. Get him on camera.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.708
Day one, and my dude's already late.

37:43.500 --> 37:46.750
Look, I was up all night brainstorming.
We're gonna do a whole series on you.

37:46.750 --> 37:49.500
<i>Can Chang Dunk?</i>

37:49.500 --> 37:51.458
- Uh, no, no.
- That's gonna be A-plus content.

37:51.458 --> 37:54.041
All you gotta do is look... Look.
You gonna look in the camera,

37:54.041 --> 37:56.791
tell the people who you are
and why we're all out here.

37:56.791 --> 37:58.000
Cool.

37:58.791 --> 38:00.000
Action.

38:00.583 --> 38:04.958
Uh, I'm Chang. I'm 16, 5'8", and I'm...

38:05.791 --> 38:09.250
Uh, I'm trying
to dunk a basketball, hopefully?

38:09.250 --> 38:11.833
Cut! What? [scoffs] Come on, man!

38:11.833 --> 38:13.291
-  What?
- Where's your swag?

38:13.291 --> 38:14.416
- What?
- Your swag.

38:14.416 --> 38:15.916
How you gonna dunk without any swag?

38:15.916 --> 38:17.791
Dunking is, like, 80% swag.

38:17.791 --> 38:19.958
Matt and his friends are gonna clown me
if they see this.

38:19.958 --> 38:21.500
So? They already clown you.

38:21.500 --> 38:24.000
Yeah, and making YouTube videos
is supposed to help?

38:24.000 --> 38:25.833
Okay, you're not making YouTube videos.

38:25.833 --> 38:27.250
He and I are.

38:27.250 --> 38:29.791
You're trying to dunk.

38:29.791 --> 38:33.000
And if you wanna do that,
you gotta do what I'm telling you to do.

38:34.416 --> 38:37.000
And right now, what I'm telling you to do,

38:37.000 --> 38:39.333
is worry about being better
than you were yesterday.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.083
And the only way we'll know
if you're better than you were yesterday...

38:47.708 --> 38:50.041
Okay. Hey, just give us a minute, Bo.

38:50.041 --> 38:51.583
Let me holler at you, Chang.

38:54.875 --> 38:56.416
Do you know what swag really is?

38:58.000 --> 39:04.833
Swag is believing you can and will
do something you can't yet do.

39:06.541 --> 39:07.541
Okay?

39:08.041 --> 39:10.041
So, when I ask you,

39:10.041 --> 39:14.166
"Are you or are you not gonna yam it
on Matt's stupid head?"

39:15.583 --> 39:16.583
You say?

39:18.000 --> 39:19.000
I am.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.208
Yeah, you are.

39:21.791 --> 39:23.375
Can you or can you not dunk?

39:24.875 --> 39:27.166
I can dunk. I can dunk.

39:27.166 --> 39:30.125
- Can you or can you not dunk?
- Yeah, I can dunk.

39:30.125 --> 39:32.291
- Okay. Can you or can you not dunk?
- I can dunk.

39:32.291 --> 39:33.875
- Can you or can you not dunk?
- I can dunk.

39:33.875 --> 39:37.500
Okay, then. Look in the camera and tell
the people what the move is. Let's go!

39:39.208 --> 39:43.083
Yo. I'm Chang, and I'm gonna dunk it
on all my haters. Yeah!

39:45.375 --> 39:48.208
Oh, shoot. Okay. Sorry.

39:48.208 --> 39:50.625
- Oh, you were serious. I didn't know.

39:50.625 --> 39:52.458
- I'm sorry, bro! Come on.
- No, no, no!

39:52.458 --> 39:54.250
- We're gonna work on that.
-  Damn.

39:54.250 --> 39:56.000
- Hey, Chang! Come back!
-  Come back!

39:56.000 --> 39:57.250
That wasn't awful.

39:57.250 --> 39:58.916
- It just wasn't fantastic.
-  Come back!

40:00.041 --> 40:01.791
Your home away from home.

40:02.791 --> 40:05.416
No weight. No plates.
Just you and the bar.

40:05.416 --> 40:08.375
Whatever's comfortable for you.
Find your grip. Knees over toes.

40:08.375 --> 40:09.708
Remember tempo. Nice.

40:11.291 --> 40:12.625
Did you just fart?

40:12.625 --> 40:14.625
-<i>That was Bo.</i>
-  It's up. It's up.

40:14.625 --> 40:17.083
-  Let's see what the people say.
-  Um...

40:17.083 --> 40:18.166
See?

40:18.166 --> 40:19.583

the ground and jumping for the sky.

At the bottom
of that rice bucket is a key.

41:01.625 --> 41:03.375

43:39.166 --> 43:40.833
I don't want my neighbors to hate me.

43:41.500 --> 43:43.166
That and I'm camera shy.

43:43.166 --> 43:45.875
There's a lot of evidence
suggesting otherwise.

43:45.875 --> 43:48.333
Oh, great. You found Dre's channel.

43:49.583 --> 43:51.458
Some people in the band showed it to me.

43:51.458 --> 43:53.583
But it's pretty awesome.

43:54.291 --> 43:55.458
- Really?
- Yeah.

43:55.458 --> 43:57.208
And you're making a lot of progress.

43:58.916 --> 44:01.625
Not quite there yet,
but I'm getting close.

44:08.333 --> 44:09.791
What's that over there?

44:09.791 --> 44:12.791
It's a project my dad started
but never finished.

44:13.375 --> 44:15.958
My mom wants to do something with it,
but she's been too busy.

44:15.958 --> 44:17.583
So, it's just been sitting there.

44:20.791 --> 44:23.041
Can we please go before she comes back?

44:23.041 --> 44:25.291
What, are you afraid
I'm gonna embarrass you or something?

44:25.291 --> 44:29.458
No, no. It's more that
I'm afraid she's gonna embarrass me.

44:29.458 --> 44:30.875
How so?

44:31.833 --> 44:35.916
Uh, it's hard to explain. She's just...

44:35.916 --> 44:37.375
A mom?

44:37.375 --> 44:39.208
I guess.

44:42.541 --> 44:43.875
We have a weird relationship.

44:45.750 --> 44:48.333
Yeah, we don't really get along.

44:50.500 --> 44:52.916
Well, my mom and I used to be
at each other's throats.

44:52.916 --> 44:54.291
We couldn't stand each other.

44:54.875 --> 45:01.125
But after my dad died, we got super close.
My sister and I too.

45:02.416 --> 45:03.416
Don't get me wrong.

45:03.416 --> 45:07.583
They still annoy the hell out of me,
but deep down, I know we're like this.

45:12.666 --> 45:16.208
Sometimes, family doesn't always love us
the way we want.

45:17.541 --> 45:19.291
Doesn't mean
they're not trying their best.

45:22.291 --> 45:25.666
Wow. That's-- That's deep.

45:28.208 --> 45:29.333
You're deep.

45:30.166 --> 45:31.541
- Shut up.
-  What? You are.

45:31.541 --> 45:33.125
- You are.
- I'm serious.

45:35.041 --> 45:36.541
It's got a lot of potential.

45:38.250 --> 45:39.875
You should help her fix it up.

45:39.875 --> 45:40.958
Uh--

45:42.541 --> 45:43.541
I will.

45:45.958 --> 45:46.958
Once I dunk.

45:50.083 --> 45:51.125
Yeah.

46:16.500 --> 46:18.250
I don't know how he got it in.

46:22.250 --> 46:23.833
Get up. Nice.

46:23.833 --> 46:25.083
Good.

46:26.416 --> 46:27.875
Oh. Good.

46:28.458 --> 46:30.291
Y'all wanna run? We need two.

46:34.583 --> 46:35.833
Come on. I got you.

46:35.833 --> 46:38.541
Rely on me if you need to,
but you're a machine. Let's go.

46:38.541 --> 46:40.791
What's up, y'all? Who we got?
How many we got?

46:42.083 --> 46:43.500
Hey, pull up! Pull up, pull up!

46:57.833 --> 46:59.500
I got you. Come on. Let's work.

46:59.500 --> 47:03.291
-  Yo, let's go! Pick it up!
-  Right there. Right there.

47:03.291 --> 47:04.541
 <i>We got a Chang overboard.</i>

47:04.541 --> 47:06.833
Lock up.
Let 'em know we just don't play offense.

47:06.833 --> 47:08.625
Okay? I'm here.

47:09.833 --> 47:11.833
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
-  Go, go, go, go!

47:14.833 --> 47:16.458
Heck yeah. Nice.

47:16.458 --> 47:19.375
Nothing to say.
Way to trail, Chang. Way to trail.

47:21.958 --> 47:23.291
Right there. Find a space.

47:23.875 --> 47:25.333
Create your space.

47:25.333 --> 47:27.791
Good shot, boy. Good [bleep] shot, kid.

47:28.375 --> 47:29.750
- Good shot, boy.
-  That's money!

47:29.750 --> 47:32.083
What I tell you? Good shot!

47:32.083 --> 47:33.166
Let's go, now. Lock up.

47:45.791 --> 47:49.208
Yeah! My man got up, didn't he?
He got up, didn't he?

47:56.625 --> 47:58.458
<i>Look.
Right here, this is my go-to.</i>

47:58.458 --> 48:01.958
Okay, look. Check it out. In and out.
Cross. Take off on one foot. Watch.

48:02.791 --> 48:04.125
Oh!

48:04.125 --> 48:06.541
In your face!

48:06.541 --> 48:09.250
Man! That must feel so good to do in game.

48:09.250 --> 48:11.000
Oh, it's unbelievable.

48:11.541 --> 48:13.458
Spiritual, honestly.

48:13.458 --> 48:15.333
Everyone in the room got hit
with this feeling.

48:15.333 --> 48:16.958
-  <i>Let's go!</i>
- You see that?

48:16.958 --> 48:19.500
- They're jumping up and down, screaming...
-<i>Heigh-ho! Hey! What's my name?</i>

48:19.500 --> 48:22.416
...sharing the same damn energy,
and it's all because of you.

48:22.416 --> 48:24.666
Like, I did that. You know?

48:27.291 --> 48:28.583
Hey, can I ask you something?

48:29.375 --> 48:30.708
Oh, yeah, man. Shoot.

48:32.375 --> 48:34.333
Did you ever try to make it to the League?

48:34.916 --> 48:37.375
You know I did. Absolutely.

48:37.375 --> 48:39.250
After college, I had a tryout or two.

48:39.791 --> 48:43.458
I worked my ass off.
Nobody worked harder than me.

48:45.041 --> 48:46.208
But it didn't work out.

48:49.416 --> 48:50.416
Why not?

48:51.250 --> 48:52.333
Lots of reasons.

48:53.333 --> 48:56.875
Some because of me.
Some out of my control.

48:57.791 --> 49:00.416
But that's life, you know?

49:00.416 --> 49:04.500
I still made it to Europe.
I played really well.

49:04.500 --> 49:06.666
You know what I'm saying?
Like, I had a blast over there.

49:09.875 --> 49:12.458
You know,
sometimes the call doesn't go your way.

49:13.666 --> 49:15.250
You just gotta play through it.

49:17.625 --> 49:19.583
Okay, okay.

49:21.416 --> 49:23.041
My turn to ask a question.

49:25.083 --> 49:28.208
Why do you wanna dunk so bad? Huh?

49:28.208 --> 49:29.791
Is it really about this bet with Matt,

49:29.791 --> 49:33.041
or does it have something to do with that
pretty little girl you got your eye on?

49:36.083 --> 49:38.750
I mean, yeah. All of the above.

49:40.416 --> 49:44.750
I guess if I could dunk, it would be proof
that I could be more than who I am.

49:46.541 --> 49:49.083
You know, someone special.

49:50.541 --> 49:56.875
Chang, I ain't ever met a kid who gets up
at 5:30 a.m. at his own volition

49:57.625 --> 50:01.166
just to bust his butt
for two months straight.

50:01.166 --> 50:03.125
You already damn special.

50:04.208 --> 50:07.416
And don't you let anyone
ever convince you otherwise.

50:08.875 --> 50:10.166
Can I ask you something else?

50:10.833 --> 50:11.833
Absolutely.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.916
- Just be honest with me, all right?
- Always.

50:15.500 --> 50:19.000
Do you really think I'm gonna dunk?

50:19.000 --> 50:22.958
Chang, I know you're gonna dunk.

50:30.250 --> 50:31.250
Oh.

50:34.083 --> 50:35.166
Ooh!

50:37.166 --> 50:39.041
Chang, let's go, baby. Let's go.

50:42.583 --> 50:43.625
Hey, Mom.

50:47.916 --> 50:48.916
Are you hungry?

50:59.666 --> 51:02.250
When did you learn how to do this?

51:02.250 --> 51:03.583
I've been practicing.

51:09.750 --> 51:12.541
So? Do you like it?

51:13.041 --> 51:14.041
Mmm.

51:15.791 --> 51:17.291
Needs a little more salt.

51:19.625 --> 51:21.500
I saw you walking with a girl.

51:24.333 --> 51:25.750
Is that your girlfriend?

51:26.666 --> 51:30.083
No,
we're just in the band together.

51:30.083 --> 51:31.375
She's just a friend.

51:31.375 --> 51:32.875
She's pretty.

51:32.875 --> 51:36.083
Yeah, uh-- I guess. She's pretty.

51:36.083 --> 51:37.416
Does she like you?

51:38.000 --> 51:39.958
I don't know. Probably not.

51:43.125 --> 51:44.541
You're just too shy.

51:48.041 --> 51:49.666
You need to be more confident.

51:50.666 --> 51:53.291
Yeah, well, we're just friends, so it's...

51:54.208 --> 51:55.208
Hmm.

51:57.208 --> 51:58.208
Okay.

51:59.916 --> 52:00.958
How is school?

52:04.416 --> 52:06.708
Good. Good.

52:08.791 --> 52:10.750
You seem very busy these days.

52:12.416 --> 52:15.208
Yeah, I feel like
I could take on new things, so I have.

52:16.333 --> 52:17.333
Like what?

52:18.500 --> 52:20.125
Like hobbies.

52:20.125 --> 52:21.875
What kind of hobbies?

52:21.875 --> 52:24.583
I don't know. Like--
Good ones. Does it matter?

52:25.208 --> 52:27.458
I'm just asking simple questions.

52:27.458 --> 52:30.125
Yeah, but it just sounds like
you're implying something.

52:30.125 --> 52:32.750
You know, like,
whatever I'm doing is a waste of my time.

52:32.750 --> 52:34.333
I didn't say that.

52:34.333 --> 52:35.958
Yeah, but that's what you meant, right?

52:37.166 --> 52:40.958
Why are you getting angry?
I'm just asking simple questions.

52:40.958 --> 52:43.166
Because everything you say
feels like a judgment.

52:44.541 --> 52:47.291
Maybe there's something
you don't want to tell me.

52:47.291 --> 52:49.166
See? Exactly.

52:53.291 --> 52:55.875
How can I judge you?
I know you.

52:56.750 --> 52:58.000
Oh, you know me?

53:05.916 --> 53:08.125
What does that have to do with anything?

53:08.125 --> 53:10.208
Because it make you easily get upset.

53:10.958 --> 53:13.541
You always worry about
what other people think about you,

53:13.541 --> 53:15.333
not worry about yourself.

53:15.833 --> 53:18.666
You need to be more tough, okay?

53:19.625 --> 53:21.708
Otherwise, people easy to bully you.

53:21.708 --> 53:23.708
What are you even talking about?

53:31.875 --> 53:32.875
Whatever.

53:56.375 --> 53:57.375
- It's all right.

53:57.375 --> 53:59.041
-  You're okay.
-  Close, man.

53:59.541 --> 54:02.625
Chang, don't hurt yourself,
okay? We've been in here a while.

54:03.125 --> 54:04.333
You got this, Chang.

54:04.333 --> 54:05.541
Come on, Chang!

54:05.541 --> 54:06.625
You good?

54:12.291 --> 54:14.791
- Okay. Okay, we're done. We're done.

54:14.791 --> 54:16.458
Come on. Come on.

54:18.166 --> 54:22.666
Hey. You're there.
All right? You're there.

54:23.500 --> 54:26.625
The adrenaline from tomorrow is gonna
give you the extra bounce you need.

54:26.625 --> 54:28.041
Give yourself a break.

54:29.041 --> 54:32.625
So, uh, we got you a little something.

54:38.166 --> 54:41.125
Yo.

54:41.791 --> 54:42.791
 Yes, sir.

54:44.375 --> 54:46.041
- There it is. There it is.
- Yes, sir.

54:46.041 --> 54:47.625
Hey, do me a favor tomorrow.

54:47.625 --> 54:51.208
When you throw it down,
don't forget to scream, all right?

54:51.208 --> 54:53.375
I want these people to know
who they're messing with.

54:53.375 --> 54:54.958
- You got it.
-  Okay.

54:55.666 --> 54:56.666
Thank you.

54:57.541 --> 54:58.708
Let's go get something to eat.

54:58.708 --> 55:02.166
You've been training all day.
All day long.

55:02.166 --> 55:03.750
Give yourself a break.

55:05.750 --> 55:09.750
Hey, everyone.
Yo, so tomorrow is the big day.

55:09.750 --> 55:13.750
Um, I'm still not hitting it yet,
but I'm feeling really good, you know?

55:13.750 --> 55:18.208
I'm just really grateful that everyone
who's been supporting me on-- on, uh--

55:22.500 --> 55:24.583
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

55:29.583 --> 55:33.416
Hey, sup, guys? Um, Chang here.
Yo, tomorrow's, like, the--

56:26.500 --> 56:28.833
<i>Almost, dude.
Hey, next time dunk it.</i>

56:28.833 --> 56:30.291
<i>You kind of cheated though.</i>

56:30.291 --> 56:32.541
<i>Relax, it's gym class.

<i>You need to be more tough.</i>

56:39.166 --> 56:40.708
<i>It's got a lot of potential.</i>

56:40.708 --> 56:42.375
<i>You should help her fix it up.</i>

56:42.375 --> 56:44.458
<i>I will. Once I dunk.</i>

56:44.458 --> 56:48.416
<i>Chang, I know you're gonna dunk.</i>

56:57.208 --> 57:00.291
-  Okay. My guy looks ready.

57:00.291 --> 57:01.375
Yeah.

57:01.375 --> 57:02.916
Did I do that?

57:02.916 --> 57:06.541
Did you do what? Play me in one-on-one?
'Cause I know you don't wanna do that.

57:07.166 --> 57:08.958
Hey, where are Kristy and Bo?

57:08.958 --> 57:10.583
Oh, they'll be here.

57:11.208 --> 57:16.750
Hey, it's all in here, remember?
You worked hard for this. You're ready.

57:16.750 --> 57:18.458
Yo, let's go already.

57:23.083 --> 57:25.375
-  I know. Nervous.
-  I mean...

57:31.041 --> 57:32.916
Chang. Dude,
I really got to thank you, man.

57:32.916 --> 57:37.000
I mean, my eBay right now is--

57:37.000 --> 57:38.458

57:38.458 --> 57:41.458
Yeah? Well, I already got a spot
on my wall for your Kobe jersey.

57:41.458 --> 57:42.875
Ooh!

57:42.875 --> 57:43.958
Wow.

57:43.958 --> 57:47.125
I mean, that's big talk for somebody whose
friends didn't even bother to show up.

57:51.208 --> 57:52.958
-  Oh, no!
-  Hey!

57:55.875 --> 57:57.208

58:17.541 --> 58:19.125

Okay. Look, dude, what do you want?

1:04:27.458 --> 1:04:30.250
I just want you to know
that the old Chang is gone.

1:04:30.958 --> 1:04:33.625
The new Chang is here,
and he's not for being disrespected.

1:04:40.625 --> 1:04:41.625
Whatever, man.

1:04:45.250 --> 1:04:48.000
Hey, Chang. Principal's looking for you.

1:04:48.750 --> 1:04:51.708

<i>I don't wanna get in the way

1:05:39.666 --> 1:05:41.125
How could you get in the way?

1:05:41.708 --> 1:05:44.541
I mean, a big part of why I'm here
is because of you.

1:05:45.041 --> 1:05:47.083
-<i>Is that so?</i>

1:05:47.083 --> 1:05:49.833

1:06:17.708 --> 1:06:20.500
I got asked to represent the school
at this thing in New York.

1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:22.166
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

1:06:26.250 --> 1:06:29.083
No, uh, one of the teachers
said they would chaperone me, so...

1:07:53.416 --> 1:07:54.541
I'm talking about the dunk.

1:07:54.541 --> 1:07:57.000
Okay, well,
let's talk to the person himself.

1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:59.125
Please, everybody, welcome Chang.

1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:03.625
-  What's up, brother?
- Hey, guys.

1:08:03.625 --> 1:08:06.083
- How you doing? Bring this man a seat.

1:08:06.083 --> 1:08:07.541
Look at you, superstar.

1:08:07.541 --> 1:08:09.291
- What's going on?
- Hi, nice to meet you.

1:08:09.291 --> 1:08:11.375
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

1:08:11.375 --> 1:08:13.958
- There's a superstar in the building.
- Hey, thank you. Thank you.

1:08:13.958 --> 1:08:16.083
Hi, Chang.
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

1:08:16.083 --> 1:08:17.416
Yeah. Who is Chang?

1:08:17.416 --> 1:08:19.958
- Hey, turn my man up. He's about to speak.
-  <i>Um-- Uh--</i>

1:08:19.958 --> 1:08:21.041
No touchy.

1:08:21.041 --> 1:08:25.458
I'm, you know, just a kid
who got told he couldn't do something.

1:08:26.708 --> 1:08:28.291
And I thought otherwise.

1:08:28.291 --> 1:08:29.375
Guess who was right.

1:08:29.375 --> 1:08:31.375
- Oh. Okay. Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

1:08:31.375 --> 1:08:33.333
Yeah. So, like,
what's your training regimen?

1:08:33.333 --> 1:08:35.541
Because I've seen the beginning
of your videos.

1:08:35.541 --> 1:08:37.000
You made quite the big jump, man.

1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:39.708
- I see what you did there. That was good.
-  Thank you.

1:08:39.708 --> 1:08:42.458
-<i>I thought of that before I had breakfast.</i>

1:08:42.458 --> 1:08:45.083
You know they say in magic
that a trick is only good

1:08:45.083 --> 1:08:47.083
if there's some mystery to it, so...

1:08:47.083 --> 1:08:51.125
Ooh, look at you.
Dropping balls and wisdom. I like it.

1:08:51.708 --> 1:08:54.083
<i>Okay, what I will say is,
it was a lot of hard work.</i>

1:08:54.083 --> 1:08:55.500
<i>You know. A lot of dedication.</i>

1:08:56.083 --> 1:08:59.000
<i>But I told myself early on
that I was gonna do it no matter what.</i>

1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:02.583
<i>Well,
I think we see how far somebody can go</i>

1:09:02.583 --> 1:09:04.375
if they just put
a little commitment into it.

1:09:04.375 --> 1:09:05.583
-  Facts.
- See?

1:09:05.583 --> 1:09:07.875
- Mm-hmm.
- But, Chang, before you get out of here,

1:09:07.875 --> 1:09:10.541
we do have a surprise for you.

1:09:10.541 --> 1:09:13.958
Downstairs, on the water
of our South Street Seaport studio.

1:09:13.958 --> 1:09:16.875
- You ready for this? Let's go do it.
- Uh, yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1:09:16.875 --> 1:09:18.291
Yeah, just follow Jay.

1:09:18.291 --> 1:09:20.500
- Come on. Let's go.
- Okay. Bye, guys. Thank you.

1:09:20.500 --> 1:09:22.375
-<i>It's that time.</i>
-<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

1:09:22.375 --> 1:09:23.541
<i>You too.</i>

1:09:28.250 --> 1:09:30.083
So the big moment is here.

1:09:30.083 --> 1:09:32.541
We are finally ready for it.
Chang, you ready?

1:09:33.041 --> 1:09:35.791
- Uh, it's kinda windy out here.
- It's not that windy. You got it.

1:09:35.791 --> 1:09:38.250
Come on, Jay. Help the kid out.

1:09:38.250 --> 1:09:41.416
- You want me to throw you an alley?
- Uh, no, it's okay. I think I can do it.

1:09:41.416 --> 1:09:43.375
- Take off your jacket. You got this.
- Yeah. Okay.

1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:45.791
<i>Whoo! Destroy the ground.</i>

1:09:45.791 --> 1:09:48.166
-<i>Reach for the sky. Easy work, Chang.</i>
-  <i>You got it.</i>

1:09:48.166 --> 1:09:49.958
-  Come on.
-  Form of a kangaroo.

1:09:49.958 --> 1:09:52.375
-  You got this. Come on!

1:09:52.375 --> 1:09:54.041
-  Ooh!

1:09:54.041 --> 1:09:56.208
-  <i>You'll get it next time, Chang.</i>

1:09:56.208 --> 1:09:57.666
- Ooh, man.
-  Kim,

1:09:57.666 --> 1:10:00.166
I know that's not the basketball
floating in the river.

1:10:00.166 --> 1:10:02.500
Perk,
that's the ball floating in the river.

1:10:02.500 --> 1:10:05.250
Yeah, but it's okay.
'Cause guess what, Kim?

1:10:05.250 --> 1:10:06.708
- What?
- It's not the worst thing

1:10:06.708 --> 1:10:08.583
- floating in that river.
-  Okay.

1:10:08.583 --> 1:10:10.250
That's a good point to end on.

1:10:10.250 --> 1:10:11.750
'Cause we are out of time.

1:10:11.750 --> 1:10:13.875
Up next is <i>Pardon the Interruption</i>.

1:10:16.916 --> 1:10:18.708
Don't even trip, man. It was funny.

1:10:18.708 --> 1:10:21.416
Yeah, dude, this is your second chance
of becoming a meme in a week,

1:10:21.416 --> 1:10:23.125
which, like,
that's culturally significant.

1:10:23.125 --> 1:10:25.458
Like, at this point,
you might get your own Wikipedia page.

1:10:25.458 --> 1:10:27.333
Okay, but it's gonna look like
I can't dunk.

1:10:27.333 --> 1:10:30.458
Yeah, but you can. You can.

1:10:34.625 --> 1:10:35.625
Oh, yeah.

1:10:35.625 --> 1:10:37.750
-  Yo.
-  Oh.

1:10:39.208 --> 1:10:40.541
Let's go.

1:10:41.625 --> 1:10:44.625
From here to here.

1:10:44.625 --> 1:10:46.458
- Yeah. Man of his word.

1:10:47.250 --> 1:10:50.041
-  Hi.
- Hi, it should be under Chang.

1:10:50.041 --> 1:10:51.875
He's culturally significant.

1:10:51.875 --> 1:10:54.041
Ah, here you are.

1:10:54.833 --> 1:10:55.875
Cool.

1:10:55.875 --> 1:10:58.791
Oh, wait. Uh, I'm sorry,
but your friends are not on the list.

1:10:58.791 --> 1:11:00.666
Oh, but they're with me.

1:11:00.666 --> 1:11:04.375
Uh, yes. I have you as a guest
of ESPN, but not your friends.

1:11:05.500 --> 1:11:07.875
Hey. Don't worry about it, all right?

1:11:07.875 --> 1:11:10.500
Why don't you go in, find Jay,
let him know we're out here,

1:11:10.500 --> 1:11:12.875
- and then we'll come and join you?
- Exactly.

1:11:13.500 --> 1:11:15.541
Yeah, okay.
Um, are you guys cool with that?

1:11:15.541 --> 1:11:16.958
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah, man. Come on.

1:11:16.958 --> 1:11:18.666
- Go get 'em. We'll be here waiting.
- Go on.

1:11:18.666 --> 1:11:20.125
- I'll be right back.
- Go, go.

1:11:20.125 --> 1:11:22.458
- Go. We'll wait here.
-  All right. All right.

1:11:25.416 --> 1:11:27.416
-  Go, man.
-  Go forth, young man.

1:11:27.416 --> 1:11:30.000
-  We'll be here.
-  We'll be here waiting.

1:11:42.541 --> 1:11:44.750
- Hey, have you seen Jay Williams?
- Mm-mmm.

1:11:44.750 --> 1:11:45.875
Thank you.

1:11:45.875 --> 1:11:47.666
- Have you seen Jay Williams?
- No.

1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:54.625
-  Hey, man. Watch it.
-  Yo.

1:11:54.625 --> 1:11:56.500
- Wait.
- Wait, you're--

1:11:56.500 --> 1:11:58.416
That's the kid from the meme.

1:11:58.416 --> 1:12:00.250
- Ooh, snap! What's up?
- I can't believe it.

1:12:00.250 --> 1:12:01.500
- What's going on?
- I'm Chang.

1:12:01.500 --> 1:12:03.458
Yo, man, I'm Rich. Yeah, nice to meet you.

1:12:03.458 --> 1:12:06.458
-  Congratulations. Much respect.
- This dude learned to dunk in ten weeks.

1:12:06.458 --> 1:12:08.125
Wait, whoa, are you here by yourself?

1:12:08.125 --> 1:12:10.583
- Oh, I actually--
- Yo, yo. Look who we found.

1:12:10.583 --> 1:12:12.625
- The kid from the meme.
- You gotta come with us.

1:12:12.625 --> 1:12:15.458
Yo, come on, come on now. Come over here.
Come on, man. Come on.

1:12:16.291 --> 1:12:18.208
Is that the kid from the meme?

1:12:18.208 --> 1:12:20.666
Like, where would Michael Jordan be
without Phil Jackson?

1:12:20.666 --> 1:12:22.208
- Know what I mean?

1:12:22.208 --> 1:12:24.916
It's kinda like-- Which is--
So that's-- that's why I'm--

1:12:27.541 --> 1:12:29.250
Hey. Hey, nice to meet you.

1:12:30.083 --> 1:12:31.166
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

1:12:31.166 --> 1:12:33.708
Pulling his car,
jumping rope, grabbing rice.

1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:38.458
Ooh.

1:12:43.333 --> 1:12:45.708
Chang! Chang!

1:12:53.166 --> 1:12:55.750
Yo,
it was great meeting you guys.

1:12:55.750 --> 1:12:57.791
Hey, I'll follow you, all right?
Let's kick it.

1:12:57.791 --> 1:12:59.708
-  See you, man.
- All right.

1:12:59.708 --> 1:13:01.541
Can't believe we met a meme.

1:13:01.541 --> 1:13:03.375
He was cool though, right?

1:13:04.291 --> 1:13:05.958
Yo, Dre!

1:13:05.958 --> 1:13:07.833
You won't believe what happened, man.

1:13:07.833 --> 1:13:09.041
It was so cool.

1:13:09.041 --> 1:13:11.250
Yo, I got to meet some legendary players.

1:13:11.250 --> 1:13:12.791
We talked sneakers, favorite foods.

1:13:12.791 --> 1:13:14.833
And they hooked it up too.
These are for you.

1:13:14.833 --> 1:13:17.458
Oh. [scoffs] Thanks, man.

1:13:18.541 --> 1:13:20.958
- These are cool.

1:13:22.041 --> 1:13:23.791
Uh-- Yo, where are Bo and Kristy?

1:13:23.791 --> 1:13:26.583
Oh, we were waiting for a while,
and they were getting tired,

1:13:26.583 --> 1:13:28.416
- so I took 'em home.

1:13:28.416 --> 1:13:32.166
Oh, yeah. Uh, I tried to get you guys in,
but I couldn't find Jay.

1:13:32.166 --> 1:13:34.625
And by the time I did,
you guys were already gone so...

1:13:35.125 --> 1:13:36.666
Yeah. Look, man. I get it.

1:13:37.750 --> 1:13:39.458
Did you have fun though?

1:13:40.041 --> 1:13:41.041
- Chang!

1:13:41.041 --> 1:13:42.708
- Yeah?
- Did you have fun?

1:13:42.708 --> 1:13:44.041
Yeah, man.

1:13:44.625 --> 1:13:46.541
I think tonight's
the best night of my life.

1:13:47.416 --> 1:13:48.625

- Man, how's it going?

1:14:25.041 --> 1:14:26.041
Kristy!

1:14:27.375 --> 1:14:28.583
President Chang.

1:14:28.583 --> 1:14:31.041
- I've been looking everywhere for you.

1:14:31.041 --> 1:14:32.875
It didn't seem that way last night.

1:14:33.625 --> 1:14:35.041
What do you mean?

1:14:35.041 --> 1:14:37.458
I got a pair of Air Jordans
with your name on them.

1:14:37.458 --> 1:14:38.875
Right.

1:14:40.333 --> 1:14:42.208
Okay. I'm sorry.

1:14:42.958 --> 1:14:46.708
I tried to get you guys in,
but I got distracted. All right?

1:14:46.708 --> 1:14:49.041
All these sick celebs wanted
to hang out with me.

1:14:49.041 --> 1:14:50.125
I know.

1:14:50.125 --> 1:14:53.750
And that is really cool, Chang,
but you could have checked your phone.

1:14:54.291 --> 1:14:55.666
Let us know what was going on.

1:14:55.666 --> 1:14:57.041
You completely ditched us.

1:14:58.166 --> 1:14:59.541
I-- Well--

1:14:59.541 --> 1:15:01.250
All right. I'll see you later.

1:15:01.250 --> 1:15:04.291
Oh, okay, Kristy. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:15:04.291 --> 1:15:07.083
Do you actually even like me?

1:15:07.083 --> 1:15:08.791
What do you mean? Of course I do.

1:15:08.791 --> 1:15:10.958
You have a really funny way of showing it.

1:15:13.208 --> 1:15:15.208
It was Richard Jefferson!

1:15:16.125 --> 1:15:18.041
And Andre Drummond!

1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:20.416
Yeah, I know.

1:15:20.416 --> 1:15:23.083
Okay, come on.
Don't tell me you're mad at me too.

1:15:23.083 --> 1:15:24.833
Dude, I tried to get you guys in.

1:15:24.833 --> 1:15:27.333
It didn't really seem that way
from your Instagram.

1:15:27.333 --> 1:15:30.625
Okay, look, yesterday
was supposed to be my night, all right?

1:15:31.375 --> 1:15:33.166
You know what? Chang 2.0 sucks.

1:15:37.375 --> 1:15:39.541
But then I was like,
"Yeah, I'd take the bet."

1:15:39.541 --> 1:15:41.958
And they were like,
"Ooh, who is this kid?"

1:15:41.958 --> 1:15:46.166
And I was like, "Yo, I'm just Chang."

1:15:46.166 --> 1:15:47.250
Hey, Chang.

1:15:49.208 --> 1:15:50.916
-  Yo, go off, Matt.
- What?

1:15:50.916 --> 1:15:52.250
I knew you couldn't dunk.

1:15:52.250 --> 1:15:53.875
Is your memory really that short?

1:15:54.375 --> 1:15:56.166
I literally threw it down in your face.

1:15:56.166 --> 1:15:59.625
Mmm. Well,
that's probably because you cheated.

1:15:59.625 --> 1:16:02.166
<i>This dunk video has been
circulating online,</i>

1:16:02.166 --> 1:16:05.833
<i>and I gotta admit, I was quite impressed,
until I noticed something strange...</i>

1:16:05.833 --> 1:16:09.458
You're gonna come at my face 'cause some
random dude on the Internet made a video?

1:16:09.458 --> 1:16:11.333
What? Do you think the Earth is flat too?

1:16:11.333 --> 1:16:14.541
- Hmm. You see that red mark?
-<i>...by the acceleration of gravity,</i>

1:16:14.541 --> 1:16:17.000
-<i>we're left with 1.75 inches...</i>
- I caught you, Chang.

1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:19.500
<i>...we can divide that by .6
to get the actual height of the goal,</i>

1:16:19.500 --> 1:16:22.458
<i>which is way below the regulation 10 feet.</i>

1:16:22.458 --> 1:16:25.625
<i>So, in conclusion, it seems that no,</i>

1:16:25.625 --> 1:16:28.208
-<i>Chang can't dunk.</i>
- Chang can't dunk.

1:16:28.208 --> 1:16:29.458
-  No, he can't!

1:16:29.458 --> 1:16:32.375
This explains why you were acting weird
the next day and why I kept missing.

1:16:32.375 --> 1:16:33.458
I'm never that off.

1:16:33.458 --> 1:16:35.833
That proves nothing except
that you're a sore loser.

1:16:35.833 --> 1:16:36.916
Hmm, does it?

1:16:38.625 --> 1:16:39.625
All right.

1:16:41.125 --> 1:16:43.000
- Do it again then.
- No.

1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:44.833
-  Whoa.
- I already did.

1:16:44.833 --> 1:16:46.208
No, you didn't, you cheater.

1:16:46.208 --> 1:16:48.250
Yo, what's your problem, Matt?

1:16:48.250 --> 1:16:50.541
- Why can't you accept that I can dunk?
- Because you can't.

1:16:50.541 --> 1:16:52.541
- Why not?
- Because you can't, dude.

1:16:52.541 --> 1:16:55.333
- Like, what do you--
- Stop avoiding the question, Matt.

1:16:55.333 --> 1:16:57.708
- Why don't you think I can dunk?
- Because you can't.

1:16:57.708 --> 1:16:59.208
But how can you be so sure?

1:16:59.791 --> 1:17:02.708
What? 'Cause I'm not as tall as you?
'Cause I'm not as cool as you?

1:17:02.708 --> 1:17:03.833
'Cause I'm Asian?

1:17:03.833 --> 1:17:05.666
-  Oh!

1:17:07.833 --> 1:17:09.750
Dude, what are you even talking about?

1:17:09.750 --> 1:17:11.791
Why can't you just let me win for once?

1:17:11.791 --> 1:17:13.125
Because you're a cheater.

1:17:14.750 --> 1:17:15.750
No.

1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:21.208
It's because you hate that someone like me
can actually be cooler than you.

1:17:22.250 --> 1:17:25.166
You hate that I have more followers
than you ever did.

1:17:25.166 --> 1:17:27.958
You think you're all that?
You're not even that good at basketball.

1:17:27.958 --> 1:17:29.333
- You're barely ranked.
- Whoa.

1:17:29.333 --> 1:17:32.250
You think you're gonna play DI?
That's a pipe dream, man.

1:17:33.125 --> 1:17:35.625
Yo, the minute you graduate,
it's over for you.

1:17:35.625 --> 1:17:37.666
All right? You peaked. But me?

1:17:38.375 --> 1:17:40.375
I'm moving on to bigger and better things.

1:17:42.375 --> 1:17:44.166
And you still can't dunk.

1:17:44.166 --> 1:17:45.875
Ooh.

1:17:45.875 --> 1:17:49.708
I mean, you wanted everybody
to like you so bad and in the end, what?

1:17:49.708 --> 1:17:50.958
You just tricked 'em?

1:17:52.666 --> 1:17:53.750
You wish you were me.

1:17:55.583 --> 1:17:57.541
You're nothing more than a lying poser.

1:17:57.541 --> 1:17:59.541
-  Whoa!

1:18:06.791 --> 1:18:09.500
-  ...ganged up on him...
-  What kind of security system

1:18:09.500 --> 1:18:12.750
- do you have that somebody can break in...
-  ...pummeled him with a razor.

1:18:12.750 --> 1:18:14.875
...I think that we need to--

1:18:14.875 --> 1:18:16.541
-  Hello.
- Mrs. Chang, hi.

1:18:16.541 --> 1:18:18.250
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:27.916
-  What did I do?
-  Okay.

1:18:27.916 --> 1:18:31.541
So, your son got into a fight
with Matt today.

1:18:31.541 --> 1:18:36.000
Apparently, it was about the social media,
which is unfortunately very common.

1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:37.333
Common?

1:18:37.333 --> 1:18:40.166
My son had his head shaved
in front of the whole school.

1:18:40.166 --> 1:18:41.250
And there's video.

1:18:41.916 --> 1:18:46.208
It's all over the Internet.
Millions of views. From every angle.

1:18:46.208 --> 1:18:48.541
- I know you're upset, but--
-  Upset?

1:18:48.541 --> 1:18:52.875
Our family therapist said that he could
have PTSD for the rest of his life.

1:18:52.875 --> 1:18:54.250
- Mom, that's a bit--
- Just--

1:18:54.250 --> 1:18:56.458
- Look at this. Look at this.
- No one asked you.

1:18:59.083 --> 1:19:03.125
<i>Shave his head!
Shave his head! Shave his head!</i>

1:19:03.125 --> 1:19:05.333
<i>Shave his head! Shave his head!</i>

1:19:05.333 --> 1:19:08.291
-<i>Shave his head! Shave his head!</i>

1:19:20.583 --> 1:19:21.750
Huh?

1:19:32.791 --> 1:19:37.000
Please. I'm begging you.
This is all my fault.

1:19:37.625 --> 1:19:39.166
I didn't raise my son properly.

1:19:39.166 --> 1:19:41.833
- Oh, my God.
- We'll do whatever you want.

1:19:41.833 --> 1:19:44.166
Mrs. Chang. Look.

1:19:44.166 --> 1:19:46.958
We already discussed a solution, okay?

1:19:47.625 --> 1:19:50.541
Matt and Chang are going
to be suspended for a week each.

1:19:50.541 --> 1:19:53.083
Chang has to return Matt's Kobe jersey.

1:19:53.083 --> 1:19:56.208
- Can't believe you bet a family treasure.

1:19:56.208 --> 1:20:00.375
In addition, Matt has asked that Chang
make an apology video on his vlog

1:20:00.375 --> 1:20:02.000
admitting that he cheated.

1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:06.458
Now, if all of that happens,
we can end this right here, okay?

1:20:07.958 --> 1:20:10.250
Cheating? Vlog?

1:20:10.250 --> 1:20:12.041
Yes. About the dunking.

1:20:12.541 --> 1:20:16.541
He broke into the school at night
and adjusted one of the rims to do it.

1:20:16.541 --> 1:20:19.666
Now, that is criminal trespass
and vandalism,

1:20:19.666 --> 1:20:22.625
but if we put this behind us,

1:20:22.625 --> 1:20:25.291
I don't think we need to involve
the police on this one.

1:20:25.291 --> 1:20:27.708
What? Police?

1:20:33.333 --> 1:20:36.875
Why do you not care
that he hit me? Huh? Why do you--

1:20:39.958 --> 1:20:41.666
I thought Matt is your friend.

1:20:43.458 --> 1:20:45.125
- Why you fight him?
- We're not friends.

1:20:46.333 --> 1:20:48.500
We haven't been friends
since elementary school.

1:20:51.750 --> 1:20:53.125
- Why?

1:20:54.500 --> 1:20:55.500
What happened?

1:20:56.916 --> 1:20:58.125
You wouldn't understand.

1:21:07.375 --> 1:21:09.125
Why do you treat me like this?

1:21:10.833 --> 1:21:13.458
You waste time with a stranger
from YouTube.

1:21:14.291 --> 1:21:16.416
You don't even want to talk
to your own mother.

1:21:17.166 --> 1:21:18.791
Is your mother so useless?

1:21:19.625 --> 1:21:21.083
At least Deandre listens to me.

1:21:21.958 --> 1:21:23.625
He doesn't put me down like you do.

1:21:24.333 --> 1:21:25.541
He cares about me.

1:21:28.458 --> 1:21:29.666
He cares about you?

1:21:31.125 --> 1:21:32.375
He uses you.

1:21:33.083 --> 1:21:35.208
Make you make a fool out of yourself.

1:21:53.791 --> 1:21:55.541
Stop guilt-tripping me!

1:21:56.250 --> 1:21:58.083
You're always upset about something.

1:21:58.083 --> 1:21:59.458
I can't tell you anything,

1:21:59.458 --> 1:22:02.791
'cause I don't know if you'll snap at me,
or you'll tell me it's stupid.

1:22:02.791 --> 1:22:05.750
I wanna tell you things!
I wanna ask you stuff!

1:22:06.625 --> 1:22:07.625
But I can't!

1:22:08.458 --> 1:22:09.458
Why?

1:22:11.208 --> 1:22:12.541
Because I'm scared of you.

1:22:13.333 --> 1:22:14.583
You're scared of me?

1:22:16.166 --> 1:22:17.291
You're scared of me?

1:22:18.458 --> 1:22:21.666
I work so hard
to give you everything I can.

1:22:25.291 --> 1:22:26.416
I spoil you.

1:22:27.583 --> 1:22:30.000
You want another mother? You can't!

1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:31.791
I am your mother.

1:22:33.166 --> 1:22:34.291
I get it now.

1:22:35.666 --> 1:22:36.916
I finally see it.

1:22:38.208 --> 1:22:39.875
Why you can't support anything I do.

1:22:40.666 --> 1:22:42.250
Why you're always putting me down.

1:22:43.791 --> 1:22:46.000
It's because you're miserable.

1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:49.500
You're so unhappy,
you need everyone else to be unhappy too.

1:22:50.875 --> 1:22:52.666
Well, I don't want to be like you!

1:22:52.666 --> 1:22:54.416
I don't want to always be alone!

1:24:09.333 --> 1:24:10.750
Okay. Let's go.

1:24:20.375 --> 1:24:21.583
Come on.

1:25:06.208 --> 1:25:08.500
Destroy the ground. Reach for the sky.

1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:22.083
Ming Ming!

1:25:24.125 --> 1:25:26.458
- Ming Ming!

1:25:38.625 --> 1:25:41.458
I can't do it. I can't do it.

1:25:41.458 --> 1:25:42.791
I'm not good enough.

1:25:45.166 --> 1:25:46.833
I'm not good enough.

1:26:01.416 --> 1:26:03.000
This is gonna be my last vlog.

1:26:04.666 --> 1:26:10.458
As a lot of you know,
someone accused me of cheating on my dunk.

1:26:13.416 --> 1:26:15.083
And I'm here to say that...

1:26:18.583 --> 1:26:19.583
it's true.

1:26:22.250 --> 1:26:24.666
<i>I trained really, really hard.</i>

1:26:25.666 --> 1:26:29.583
<i>I gave it my all,
but I was still coming up short.</i>

1:26:32.500 --> 1:26:35.000
I should've just been proud
of how far I've come

1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.041
and tried to dunk it fair and square...

1:26:41.458 --> 1:26:43.583
but I guess I was too afraid
I was gonna fail.

1:26:45.666 --> 1:26:47.541
<i>I think maybe this whole time,</i>

1:26:48.541 --> 1:26:52.333
<i>I didn't really care about
whether or not I could dunk.</i>

1:26:53.708 --> 1:26:58.458
<i>Maybe what I really wanted was just
for other people to think that I could.</i>

1:27:01.125 --> 1:27:03.750
I'm sorry to Matt for cheating on the bet.

1:27:07.916 --> 1:27:13.000
And I'm especially sorry
to my coach, Deandre...

1:27:15.375 --> 1:27:19.833
<i>and my friends Bo and Kristy.</i>

1:27:21.541 --> 1:27:23.375
And to everyone that's been...

1:27:26.541 --> 1:27:29.666
helping me along the way
and that believed in me...

1:27:35.833 --> 1:27:36.916
I'm sorry.

1:27:41.708 --> 1:27:43.125
Chang out.

1:27:58.458 --> 1:28:00.083
I-I didn't know how you took it,

1:28:00.083 --> 1:28:03.291
so I just brought a--
a whole plethora of options.

1:28:10.500 --> 1:28:11.500
Hot.

1:28:12.666 --> 1:28:14.375
Hot. Very hot.

1:28:15.458 --> 1:28:17.833
You're a basketball coach?

1:28:18.666 --> 1:28:19.666
Yes.

1:28:19.666 --> 1:28:22.000
Then why do you work in a Verizon store?

1:28:22.583 --> 1:28:25.375
You know,
your son had that same exact thought.

1:28:26.500 --> 1:28:28.041
You're not really a coach.

1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:32.875
But you tell my son you are,
and you use him to do your YouTube.

1:28:32.875 --> 1:28:34.541
Wait, that's not totally fair.

1:28:34.541 --> 1:28:38.708
My son never caused trouble before.
Then he meet you.

1:28:38.708 --> 1:28:41.666
Now he's fighting at school.
He don't even want to talk to me, and he--

1:28:41.666 --> 1:28:44.000
Ma'am, I don't know
why your son took to me either.

1:28:44.583 --> 1:28:47.791
We really just talked about basketball.
Really, just dunking.

1:28:47.791 --> 1:28:49.750
Why dunking?

1:28:49.750 --> 1:28:51.500
What can you do with this dunking thing?

1:28:51.500 --> 1:28:55.041
I don't know.
But that's what he wanted to do.

1:28:56.958 --> 1:29:00.000
Chang really, really wanted to dunk.

1:29:01.125 --> 1:29:02.916
We were waking up at 5:00 a.m.

1:29:02.916 --> 1:29:06.541
Doing sprints.
I mean, pushing my car five blocks.

1:29:06.541 --> 1:29:08.916
You made my son push your car?

1:29:09.833 --> 1:29:11.750
Yes. It's great for dunking.

1:29:13.708 --> 1:29:15.333
See? Well, okay.

1:29:15.333 --> 1:29:19.291
What I'm trying to say is,
when we got started,

1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:22.250
I thought he'd quit after a week or two.

1:29:23.500 --> 1:29:26.375
Maybe we'd get one or two videos, max.

1:29:27.250 --> 1:29:31.458
But he didn't. He kept going.

1:29:32.875 --> 1:29:35.208
I mean, he surprised the hell outta me.

1:29:35.208 --> 1:29:37.125
Look. I'll show you.

1:29:38.541 --> 1:29:42.041
Please. Just-- Just-- Just look.

1:29:43.916 --> 1:29:46.375
<i>Okay. You're okay.
I got you spotted. I'm right here.</i>

1:29:46.375 --> 1:29:48.375
<i>Come on, Chang. You're all right.</i>

1:29:48.375 --> 1:29:50.541
-  <i>You got one more in you?</i>

1:29:50.541 --> 1:29:52.375
<i>You got one more in you?</i>

1:29:52.375 --> 1:29:56.583
I know Chang cheated.

1:29:57.166 --> 1:30:01.250
And I-I know he got in trouble
and all of that.

1:30:02.875 --> 1:30:06.000
But if I'm being honest,
I'm proud as hell of him.

1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:07.500
<i>Here we go.</i>

1:30:07.500 --> 1:30:10.208
And respectfully, ma'am,
you should be too.

1:30:10.750 --> 1:30:13.333
You raised a great young man.

1:30:14.916 --> 1:30:16.875
He just lost his way a little bit.

1:30:16.875 --> 1:30:18.500
<i>You got it. You got it, Chang.</i>

1:30:20.083 --> 1:30:22.583
<i>You're bouncy!</i>

1:30:23.375 --> 1:30:25.208
I haven't seen him like this...

1:30:27.083 --> 1:30:28.458
...in a long time.

1:30:30.750 --> 1:30:31.958
I'm sorry.

1:30:38.750 --> 1:30:41.416
Maybe this is my fault.

1:30:42.208 --> 1:30:45.375
No. No. No, it's not your fault.
This is nobody's fault.

1:30:46.250 --> 1:30:48.125
I think he's just trying to grow up.

1:30:49.541 --> 1:30:51.583
And that's not so easy sometimes.

1:31:14.041 --> 1:31:16.750
<i>See, he's little. That's baby meat. Baby!</i>

1:31:16.750 --> 1:31:18.833
-<i>Oh!</i>

1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:49.000
Mom? What are you doing?

1:31:59.083 --> 1:32:00.208
Mom.

1:33:03.541 --> 1:33:06.583
Mmm. [slurps] So good.

1:33:11.458 --> 1:33:12.625
I love you.

1:33:16.291 --> 1:33:18.083
I love you too.

1:33:27.583 --> 1:33:30.125
<i>And now, please welcome to the field</i>

1:33:30.125 --> 1:33:34.791
<i>last year's regional champions,
the Cresthill Marching Dragons.</i>

1:33:34.791 --> 1:33:36.291
I miss you, man.

1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:47.833
<i>Every obstacle is an opportunity.</i>

1:34:24.125 --> 1:34:25.250
Get your legs engaged.

1:34:27.875 --> 1:34:30.333
You need that core, Chang.
That's what I'm talking about. Good work.

1:34:30.333 --> 1:34:31.458
Good. Two more.

1:34:32.708 --> 1:34:33.958
Push me. You got it. Go.

1:34:34.541 --> 1:34:36.333
Good work. Good. Push. Try.

1:35:00.041 --> 1:35:01.791
<i>Find your rhythm.
Where's your drum?</i>

1:35:01.791 --> 1:35:04.583
Find your rhythm. Where's your drum? Good.

1:35:06.958 --> 1:35:08.875
-  <i>Ooh!</i>

1:35:08.875 --> 1:35:11.375
<i>I know that's not
the basketball floating in the river.</i>

1:35:46.541 --> 1:35:49.750
All right. Come on. On the line. Hurry up.
On the line. Suicides.

1:36:42.083 --> 1:36:44.208
-  Yeah!
-  Whoo!

1:36:44.208 --> 1:36:45.875
Whoo!

1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:51.125
Hey.

1:36:57.041 --> 1:36:58.458
Oh, no.

1:36:59.541 --> 1:37:01.208
- It's Serious Chang, isn't it?

1:37:01.208 --> 1:37:03.666
What did I do? What did I do?

1:37:06.583 --> 1:37:08.791
Yo, you killed it today.

1:37:09.875 --> 1:37:12.166
I think you single-handedly won
that for us.

1:37:12.166 --> 1:37:13.583
You guys win every year.

1:37:13.583 --> 1:37:19.416
- We win. We win every year.

1:37:23.583 --> 1:37:26.583
I'm really glad you moved here.

1:37:28.375 --> 1:37:30.166
And I'm really sorry.

1:37:32.166 --> 1:37:33.166
For what?

1:37:34.333 --> 1:37:36.000
- For a lot.

1:37:37.958 --> 1:37:42.250
So you thought you could just dunk,
and I would go out with you?

1:37:44.166 --> 1:37:45.166
Yes.

1:37:46.125 --> 1:37:48.250
I'm not some prize
you can just win, Chang.

1:37:49.625 --> 1:37:50.625
I know.

1:37:51.125 --> 1:37:53.583
What about us spending time together?

1:37:55.375 --> 1:37:56.875
Getting to know each other better?

1:37:56.875 --> 1:38:00.083
I guess I was afraid that
that wasn't gonna be enough.

1:38:03.500 --> 1:38:04.750
Well, you were wrong.

1:38:08.583 --> 1:38:11.875
I know you don't have to,
and I'm not expecting anything,

1:38:13.041 --> 1:38:16.208
but I'd like to make it up to you...

1:38:18.125 --> 1:38:19.125
as your friend.

1:38:20.500 --> 1:38:21.666
I appreciate that.

1:38:26.291 --> 1:38:27.291
I'll think about it.

1:38:30.250 --> 1:38:31.250
Okay.

1:38:39.750 --> 1:38:41.333
-  Chang.
- Yeah?

1:38:44.833 --> 1:38:45.833
I thought about it.

1:38:50.750 --> 1:38:52.458
Under control. Under control.

1:38:53.791 --> 1:38:55.000
Let's group up! Let's go!

1:38:55.916 --> 1:38:59.041
For some of you,
this is your last chance to make the team.

1:39:00.166 --> 1:39:01.666
Okay, shooting drills.

1:39:01.666 --> 1:39:05.750
Two teams. I want you, you,

1:39:05.750 --> 1:39:08.791
and let's round it out with Matt and, uh...

1:39:08.791 --> 1:39:10.041
You.

1:39:10.041 --> 1:39:12.708
Losing team does suicides.
First group with me.

1:39:12.708 --> 1:39:14.958
Second group with Heather.
Let's go. Come on. Look alive.

1:39:16.208 --> 1:39:18.083
Look alive, look alive.
Let's make this team.

1:39:25.375 --> 1:39:27.250
I bet you I can make more shots than you.

1:39:27.250 --> 1:39:29.958
Man, you don't give up, do you?

1:39:29.958 --> 1:39:32.458
Nope. You wanna know why?

1:39:33.583 --> 1:39:34.583

All right, let's get it done. Go!
