WEBVTT

00:01.431 --> 00:03.636
Previously on Hell's Kitchen...

00:03.637 --> 00:06.468
Tonight we are walking out
minus Robyn.

00:06.469 --> 00:07.708
With Robyn gone...

00:07.709 --> 00:08.905
Such a relief.

00:08.906 --> 00:12.920
The five remaining chefs
had their eyes on the price.

00:12.921 --> 00:14.966
The stakes are at the highest point
they've ever been right now.

00:14.967 --> 00:17.786
In a challenge
that tested the chefs ability to teach...

00:17.787 --> 00:19.174
Are you ready
to meet your students?

00:19.175 --> 00:19.751
Yes, chef.

00:19.752 --> 00:20.919
The chefs were partnered

00:20.920 --> 00:22.721
with Miss Teen USA...

00:22.722 --> 00:24.289
All you can do is teach.

00:24.290 --> 00:26.858
You girls are not dressed
to cook today.

00:26.859 --> 00:28.293
For better...
Perfect.

00:28.294 --> 00:30.395
Wow.
Perfect.

00:30.396 --> 00:31.897
Or for worse.

00:31.898 --> 00:33.131
I need to get my thong...
tongs!

00:34.200 --> 00:35.300
<i>Mamma Mia.</i>

00:35.301 --> 00:38.036
It came down
to Dana's student...

00:38.037 --> 00:39.638
Visually beautiful. Good job.
Thank you.

00:39.639 --> 00:40.839
Versus Barbie's student.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.407
Delicious.
The sauce is near perfect.

00:42.408 --> 00:44.076
You just raised the bar
yet again.

00:44.077 --> 00:45.310
<i>The winner is Barbie.
Well done.</i>

00:45.311 --> 00:47.012
<i>Really good job.</i>

00:47.013 --> 00:48.780
During Hell's Kitchen
Italian night...

00:48.781 --> 00:50.882
Clemenza, take the risotto!

00:50.883 --> 00:52.951
Barbie was determined to lead.

00:52.952 --> 00:55.020
Looks like someone literally
peed in the frying pan.

00:55.021 --> 00:56.788
I just told you
take the risotto.

00:56.789 --> 00:58.690
There's no helping this girl.

00:58.691 --> 01:00.025
She led Clemenza
in the wrong direction.

01:00.026 --> 01:02.561
Come here.
Overcooked .

01:04.030 --> 01:05.997
Clemenza...
Stop.

01:05.998 --> 01:07.399
Seemed to
have problems all night.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.700
What were the appetizers
on that table?

01:08.701 --> 01:10.235
I didn't hear it, chef.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.670
And after their great service

01:11.671 --> 01:13.438
against past runners-up...
Wow.

01:13.439 --> 01:16.108
Good job all round.
Great job.

01:16.109 --> 01:17.976
Why can't every service
be like that?

01:17.977 --> 01:19.711
Italian night was...

01:19.712 --> 01:21.580
Christina, what does that
taste like?

01:21.581 --> 01:23.381
Burnt, chef.
Bumpy to say the least.

01:23.382 --> 01:25.517
What's happened to you guys all
of a sudden?

01:25.518 --> 01:27.686
I honestly do not understand

01:27.687 --> 01:29.554
what the is going on.

01:29.555 --> 01:30.622
I'm pissed off.

01:30.623 --> 01:32.190
Get upstairs.

01:32.191 --> 01:34.226
Give me the one person you want
to get rid of.

01:34.227 --> 01:36.027
And when it
came time to nominate...

01:36.028 --> 01:37.062
Chef, I don't think the team

01:37.063 --> 01:38.864
<i>came to a final nomination,
chef.</i>

01:38.865 --> 01:41.199
They disappointed
chef Ramsay again.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.801
Does anyone have
a pair of ?

01:42.802 --> 01:43.969
Yeah.

01:43.970 --> 01:47.839
Go on, Dana.
Barbie and Clemenza.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.508
Clemenza...
Yes, chef.

01:49.509 --> 01:52.711
Seventh time standing
in front of me.

01:52.712 --> 01:54.880
In the end,
chef Ramsay decided that...

01:54.881 --> 01:57.082
Clemenza.
Was out of lives

01:57.083 --> 01:58.783
in Hell's Kitchen.
Give me your jacket

01:58.784 --> 02:00.619
and leave Hell's Kitchen,
please.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.053
And the final four
celebrated.

02:02.054 --> 02:03.522
Final four, guys.
Final four, guys.

02:03.523 --> 02:05.524
But chef Ramsay
sent them a surprise.

02:05.525 --> 02:07.659
Oh, .
Find out right now...

02:07.660 --> 02:10.362
This day has been such
an emotional roller coaster.

02:10.363 --> 02:12.097
What it is.
Oh, my God.

02:12.098 --> 02:13.665
Oh, man.
This is kind of scary.

02:13.666 --> 02:15.901
And who survives
their most challenging test

02:15.902 --> 02:17.402
of leadership so far.

02:17.403 --> 02:19.871
Each of you will have a turn

02:19.872 --> 02:21.106
running the pass.

02:21.107 --> 02:22.774
This is huge.
I have to prove

02:22.775 --> 02:24.976
I'm worthy of that position
in Vegas.

02:24.977 --> 02:27.345
As the chefs
battle to get one step closer

02:27.346 --> 02:30.182
to becoming head chef
at Gordon Ramsay Steak

02:30.183 --> 02:32.083
at Paris Las Vegas.

03:31.077 --> 03:33.078
"Enjoy this.
The best part is yet to come.

03:33.079 --> 03:34.579
<i>Chef Ramsay."</i>

03:38.217 --> 03:39.517
Oh, .

03:39.518 --> 03:40.819
Oh, my God.

03:42.955 --> 03:44.789
Are you kidding me?

03:44.790 --> 03:46.057
My mama.

03:46.058 --> 03:48.193
Oh, my God,
to see my girl and my mom,

03:48.194 --> 03:50.528
it was just amazing.

03:50.529 --> 03:52.430
Tina!

03:52.431 --> 03:54.799
Mom, dad!

03:54.800 --> 03:56.134
Is that really you?

03:56.135 --> 03:57.802
Oh, my God, my kids.

03:57.803 --> 03:58.803
Hi!

03:58.804 --> 04:00.305
My God.

04:00.306 --> 04:01.806
I knew I was gonna cry

04:01.807 --> 04:04.342
as soon as I saw my kids
and my partner.

04:08.681 --> 04:10.081
I've literally been stone-faced

04:10.082 --> 04:11.349
the whole time I've been here.

04:11.350 --> 04:12.717
I haven't really shown
any emotion.

04:12.718 --> 04:15.153
And it feels good finally
just to let go

04:15.154 --> 04:17.022
and just get that hug
from your family,

04:17.023 --> 04:18.290
that love that you
really need right now.

04:18.291 --> 04:20.158
How's it been?
Hard.

04:20.159 --> 04:22.727
We're so proud of you, Justin.

04:22.728 --> 04:24.062
These two have been like that.

04:24.063 --> 04:25.897
We're like best friends.

04:25.898 --> 04:27.699
We're hanging out every day
when we get back.

04:27.700 --> 04:28.633
They call us
The Dynamic Duo.

04:28.634 --> 04:29.901
You all right?
I am.

04:29.902 --> 04:31.670
You know me.
Yeah, I know

04:31.671 --> 04:33.071
you're tough as nails.

04:33.072 --> 04:34.873
My family is so supportive.

04:34.874 --> 04:37.175
And they're so proud of me,

04:37.176 --> 04:39.744
no matter what happens,
and I know it.

04:39.745 --> 04:41.513
Having brought their loved ones

04:41.514 --> 04:43.415
up to date on the highs
and lows

04:43.416 --> 04:44.582
<i>of Hell's Kitchen...</i>

04:44.583 --> 04:46.084
Love you.

04:46.085 --> 04:47.485
The chefs say their good-byes.

04:47.486 --> 04:48.987
To see my babe,

04:48.988 --> 04:52.190
it's honestly
exactly what I needed.

04:53.859 --> 04:55.160
I'll hold onto this moment

04:55.161 --> 04:56.695
as long as I can.

04:56.696 --> 04:58.596
<i>I love you.
I love you.</i>

05:00.266 --> 05:02.133
The family
surprise has brought the chefs

05:02.134 --> 05:03.835
a little closer to each other.

05:03.836 --> 05:05.070
<i>That was one</i>

05:05.071 --> 05:06.004
of the most emotional

05:06.005 --> 05:07.205
experiences of my life.

05:07.206 --> 05:08.606
Chef wasn't lying when he said

05:08.607 --> 05:10.675
it was just gonna get better
from here.

05:11.911 --> 05:13.611
But early the next morning,

05:13.612 --> 05:15.613
it's every chef for themself.

05:15.614 --> 05:17.649
Good morning.
Everybody downstairs.

05:17.650 --> 05:18.516
There's a car
waiting out front for you.

05:18.517 --> 05:19.918
Let's go.

05:19.919 --> 05:21.853
As the
competition is back on.

05:21.854 --> 05:23.154
Damn, man.

05:23.155 --> 05:24.422
I just woke up.

05:24.423 --> 05:25.824
I'm exhausted.

05:25.825 --> 05:28.059
We had a long night
with our family.

05:28.060 --> 05:30.595
But I have to push myself
because this is it, dude.

05:30.596 --> 05:32.430
We're taking off,
and we have no idea

05:32.431 --> 05:33.932
where we're going.

05:35.201 --> 05:37.202
Final four, it's down

05:37.203 --> 05:39.204
to the nitty-gritty, so anything
could happen at any time.

05:39.205 --> 05:40.638
The thought process is going
through your head,

05:40.639 --> 05:42.040
like, what are we gonna do?

05:42.041 --> 05:43.875
Morning.
Line up, please.

05:43.876 --> 05:45.910
We know, to be a great chef,

05:45.911 --> 05:47.746
not only do you have to be
creative and a great leader,

05:47.747 --> 05:49.948
<i>but every chef should know</i>

05:49.949 --> 05:52.050
how to maximize profits,
and that's

05:52.051 --> 05:53.585
<i>what today's challenge
is all about.</i>

05:53.586 --> 05:56.588
Each of you will be given $15.

05:56.589 --> 05:58.990
Thank you, chef.
$15.

05:58.991 --> 06:02.627
Damn.
$15 is not a lot.

06:02.628 --> 06:04.229
I'm like, come on, chef.
You got more money than that.

06:04.230 --> 06:05.630
Fork it over.

06:05.631 --> 06:07.365
You've got ten minutes

06:07.366 --> 06:09.467
to select
some stunning ingredients.

06:09.468 --> 06:11.603
After that, you're gonna head
back to Hell's Kitchen,

06:11.604 --> 06:12.837
where you've got 30 minutes

06:12.838 --> 06:14.239
to create an amazing dish.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.274
The key across this challenge

06:16.275 --> 06:18.877
is to create a dish that will
bring the highest price,

06:18.878 --> 06:21.045
<i>therefore the biggest profit.</i>

06:21.046 --> 06:22.680
Got it?
Yes, chef.

06:22.681 --> 06:24.482
Your time starts now.
Off you go.

06:24.483 --> 06:25.917
Good luck.

06:25.918 --> 06:28.019
Wow. Why don't they move
that fast at service?

06:28.020 --> 06:30.522
In this highly
creative challenge,

06:30.523 --> 06:33.358
each chef must design
a fine dining dish

06:33.359 --> 06:35.260
in ten minutes
while they shop for ingredients

06:35.261 --> 06:37.228
with a budget of $15.

06:37.229 --> 06:39.597
Can I get a weight
on this front dry-aged strip?

06:39.598 --> 06:41.666
This is definitely
an important challenge.

06:41.667 --> 06:43.802
He's got to know
that the head chef he chooses

06:43.803 --> 06:46.037
is gonna consistently
make money for him.

06:46.038 --> 06:48.039
This is a little
over 3/4 of a pound.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.908
That's all right.
Okay, sorry. Never mind.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.677
Fish is expensive.

06:52.678 --> 06:55.780
We don't pay $35.99
for Halibut in new Jersey.

06:55.781 --> 06:58.817
I'm just gonna have
to make it a small portion.

06:58.818 --> 07:00.552
Can I get five ounces

07:00.553 --> 07:01.953
<i>of Halibut, please?</i>

07:01.954 --> 07:03.888
$9.90.
Yeah, that's good.

07:03.889 --> 07:06.658
While Dana invests
in an expensive protein,

07:06.659 --> 07:08.293
Barbie is looking to take

07:08.294 --> 07:09.661
a more economical route.

07:09.662 --> 07:11.396
<i>Ah, yeah, perfect.</i>

07:11.397 --> 07:13.231
Can I have one of the center-cut
pork chops, please?

07:13.232 --> 07:14.899
My inspiration for this dish

07:14.900 --> 07:17.735
came when I saw that pork
was $5.99 a pound.

07:17.736 --> 07:19.804
Thank you very much.

07:19.805 --> 07:21.739
But I just can't have
a pork chop on the plate.

07:21.740 --> 07:23.675
I need to add value
to this dish.

07:23.676 --> 07:25.510
And I saw the sausage,

07:25.511 --> 07:26.878
and I just had to have it.

07:26.879 --> 07:28.346
Here you go.
Thank you.

07:28.347 --> 07:30.081
You're very welcome.
Four minutes left.

07:30.082 --> 07:31.516
Excuse me.
Sorry.

07:31.517 --> 07:33.518
I run around the store,
and I'm picking

07:33.519 --> 07:35.453
seasonal ingredients
that would be cheaper

07:35.454 --> 07:36.855
right now...
you know, corn and avocados.

07:36.856 --> 07:38.723
I grab those right away.
Coming out!

07:38.724 --> 07:40.258
And then I wanted
to bring it together

07:40.259 --> 07:40.859
with some colossal shrimp.

07:40.860 --> 07:41.860
Thank you very much.

07:41.861 --> 07:43.728
15 seconds left.

07:43.729 --> 07:45.430
<i>Um, just under half a pound
of swordfish steak.</i>

07:47.700 --> 07:49.000
Oh, no, you can leave it on.
Thank you.

07:49.001 --> 07:51.236
Three, two, one.

07:52.371 --> 07:54.038
With the shopping complete,

07:54.039 --> 07:56.007
it's time for the chefs to see

07:56.008 --> 07:58.409
if they stayed
within their $15 budget.

07:58.410 --> 08:00.678
$14.72.

08:00.679 --> 08:02.013
$14.04.
Awesome.

08:02.014 --> 08:03.548
Thank you.

08:03.549 --> 08:05.149
And it seems
everyone has managed

08:05.150 --> 08:06.217
to do just that.

08:06.218 --> 08:07.752
Total now is $15.77.

08:07.753 --> 08:09.220
Oh, .

08:09.221 --> 08:11.456
Except for Justin.

08:11.457 --> 08:13.091
Chef, can I borrow 77 cents?

08:13.092 --> 08:15.660
Oh, this sucks so bad.
Bring the avocado back.

08:15.661 --> 08:19.030
At some point, you have
to make the tough decision.

08:20.633 --> 08:22.600
So that brought me right back
down,

08:22.601 --> 08:23.601
and I got my last ingredient,
which was a mango,

08:23.602 --> 08:24.669
and I was good to go.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.738
$14.48.
Keep the change.

08:26.739 --> 08:28.806
Now that everyone is on budget,

08:28.807 --> 08:31.075
it's time to return
to Hell's Kitchen...

08:33.044 --> 08:34.345
And begin the cooking phase...

08:34.346 --> 08:35.914
Let's go.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.815
Of the profit margin challenge.

08:37.816 --> 08:40.784
You have 30 minutes.
Your time starts now.

08:40.785 --> 08:42.620
Let's go.
Let's do this.

08:42.621 --> 08:45.390
Aprons.

08:45.391 --> 08:47.225
Does everybody have an idea
of what they're making?

08:47.226 --> 08:49.260
Yes, chef.
I'm not 100% sure.

08:49.261 --> 08:51.129
I'm super excited
about my ingredients.

08:51.130 --> 08:52.597
I don't have 100% idea
of what I'm doing

08:52.598 --> 08:53.798
at this point,
but I'm not nervous

08:53.799 --> 08:55.300
because I'm the best.

08:55.301 --> 08:56.968
I've been doing it
every competition so far.

08:56.969 --> 08:58.403
You all
and just see what happens.

08:58.404 --> 09:00.738
I got it.
I know what I'm doing.

09:00.739 --> 09:03.107
Christina, you have
the least amount of ingredients

09:03.108 --> 09:04.542
out of everybody.
I know.

09:04.543 --> 09:05.843
All right.
Good luck.

09:05.844 --> 09:07.378
I'm worried about my dish,

09:07.379 --> 09:09.447
but I can't let my mind go
to the, you know,

09:09.448 --> 09:11.115
why didn't I get this
or why didn't I get that?

09:11.116 --> 09:12.817
I'm just hoping that,
when people see

09:12.818 --> 09:15.253
they're getting fish and shrimp,
they might be willing

09:15.254 --> 09:16.688
to pay a little bit more.

09:16.689 --> 09:18.222
Working with me.
I love you.

09:18.223 --> 09:19.324
Just under 15 minutes to go,
yeah?

09:19.325 --> 09:21.459
Yes, chef.

09:21.460 --> 09:23.094
Looking around, like,
it's so quiet in the kitchen.

09:25.331 --> 09:27.131
'Cause there's
only three other people.

09:27.132 --> 09:30.268
This challenge is make it
or break it.

09:30.269 --> 09:31.769
I mean, there's
a lot of pressure here.

09:31.770 --> 09:33.071
If you mess something up,

09:33.072 --> 09:35.273
you have nobody to blame
but yourself.

09:35.274 --> 09:36.741
Your cream's bubbling, Dana.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.109
What's that?
Watch your cream.

09:38.110 --> 09:40.445
Crap.

09:40.446 --> 09:41.713
It's a challenge.

09:41.714 --> 09:43.247
We're not working in teams.

09:43.248 --> 09:45.383
So why are you helping her?

09:45.384 --> 09:47.485
I'm only focusing on me.

09:47.486 --> 09:48.620
Come on, yo.

09:48.621 --> 09:49.921
15 seconds to go.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.489
Hot.

09:51.490 --> 09:53.091
<i>Here we go.</i>

09:53.092 --> 09:54.993
<i>Five, four,</i>

09:54.994 --> 09:56.060
three,

09:56.061 --> 09:58.896
<i>two, one, and stop, guys.</i>

10:00.633 --> 10:02.367
Okay, listen carefully,

10:02.368 --> 10:04.235
to help me judge
this profit margin challenge,

10:04.236 --> 10:06.404
I brought in
three amazing experts.

10:06.405 --> 10:08.673
Our first judge
is michelin-starred,

10:08.674 --> 10:10.508
<i>the executive chef
and the owner</i>

10:10.509 --> 10:13.878
of M.B. Post Restaurant
in Manhattan beach.

10:13.879 --> 10:16.047
Please welcome David Lefevre.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.317
<i>Chef, good to see you.</i>

10:19.318 --> 10:21.285
<i>Good to be here.
Thank you so much for coming.</i>

10:21.286 --> 10:23.388
Our next judge
is the west coast editor

10:23.389 --> 10:27.325
<i>of Bon Appetit Magazine and
a bestselling cookbook author.</i>

10:27.326 --> 10:29.494
Please welcome Hugh Garvey.

10:30.696 --> 10:32.397
Absolute pleasure.
Thank you.

10:32.398 --> 10:34.265
<i>Thanks.
Our third judge,</i>

10:34.266 --> 10:36.567
he's the general manager
of the Michelin-starred

10:36.568 --> 10:38.002
<i>Patina Restaurant Group.</i>

10:38.003 --> 10:40.204
Please welcome
Christian Philippo.

10:43.008 --> 10:44.609
<i>Good to see you.
Good to see you too.</i>

10:44.610 --> 10:46.544
Thank you.
Oh, man.

10:46.545 --> 10:48.112
This is kind of scary.

10:48.113 --> 10:51.282
I think this is gonna be
our toughest panel yet.

10:51.283 --> 10:52.750
Now listen carefully.

10:52.751 --> 10:54.185
The judges are gonna taste
your dishes.

10:54.186 --> 10:56.120
One by one,
they're gonna give me

10:56.121 --> 10:58.256
their price that they are
willing to pay for it.

10:58.257 --> 11:01.192
The chef that has
the highest average priced dish

11:01.193 --> 11:03.194
<i>wins the challenge.</i>

11:03.195 --> 11:05.129
Let's start off with Justin.

11:05.130 --> 11:06.998
<i>Oui, chef.</i>

11:06.999 --> 11:08.533
I'm the first one up,
and I'm feeling pretty confident

11:08.534 --> 11:09.867
in my dish.

11:09.868 --> 11:11.703
I know I have some bold flavors,
and I'm excited.

11:11.704 --> 11:14.105
So I went with roasted corn,
roasted mango,

11:14.106 --> 11:15.406
<i>jalapeno salsa</i>

11:15.407 --> 11:17.742
<i>and a chili shrimp on top.</i>

11:17.743 --> 11:19.377
It's nice and crispy outside.

11:19.378 --> 11:21.079
I think the cooking
is nice as well.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.780
Yeah, the shrimp
is perfectly cooked.

11:22.781 --> 11:25.950
But it's lacking
some liveliness.

11:25.951 --> 11:28.086
To me, this dish
screams lime juice.

11:28.087 --> 11:29.887
<i>You have key lime
or something like that</i>

11:29.888 --> 11:30.755
<i>to give it really that burst</i>

11:30.756 --> 11:32.056
to explode in your mouth.

11:32.057 --> 11:33.591
Good point. Christian,
let's start off with you.

11:33.592 --> 11:34.859
<i>How much would you pay?</i>

11:34.860 --> 11:37.595
I'm hoping that,
since I chose shrimp,

11:37.596 --> 11:39.263
that it's definitely gonna go
for a higher price.

11:39.264 --> 11:40.364
You know, it's seafood.

11:40.365 --> 11:41.933
It's at least a $30, $40 dish.

11:41.934 --> 11:43.468
I will say $24.

11:43.469 --> 11:45.903
$24.
Wow.

11:45.904 --> 11:47.171
What, are you kidding me?

11:47.172 --> 11:48.706
I just don't understand it,

11:48.707 --> 11:50.408
and I deserve
a lot more than that.

11:50.409 --> 11:53.678
David.
I would say probably $29.

11:53.679 --> 11:55.646
<i>Hugh, please.
I'd expect to pay</i>

11:55.647 --> 11:56.848
<i>around $32 for this.</i>

11:56.849 --> 11:58.216
Thank you.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.151
I have respect for them,
but, you know what,

12:00.152 --> 12:01.519
definitely could have gotten
more money for it.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.720
<i>Thank you, Justin.</i>

12:02.721 --> 12:03.888
Average price for your dish...

12:03.889 --> 12:05.790
<i>$28.33.</i>

12:05.791 --> 12:07.458
<i>Not bad.
Oh, it's an average.</i>

12:07.459 --> 12:08.793
Okay, Barbie, please.

12:08.794 --> 12:10.294
All right, Barbie.

12:10.295 --> 12:11.395
A lot of
pressure on my shoulders

12:11.396 --> 12:12.630
as I'm walking up,

12:12.631 --> 12:14.332
because I made a pork chop.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.768
Pork chops usually average
less than shrimp,

12:16.769 --> 12:19.036
but I still think that I have

12:19.037 --> 12:20.705
at least a $32 dish.

12:20.706 --> 12:22.340
<i>I made pork and Sauerkraut.</i>

12:22.341 --> 12:23.775
Pork is usually not

12:23.776 --> 12:25.343
<i>one of those dishes</i>

12:25.344 --> 12:28.780
<i>that you would expect
to get $35, $40 for,</i>

12:28.781 --> 12:30.414
so I added value
by adding the sausage.

12:30.415 --> 12:32.083
The pork is cooked very well.

12:32.084 --> 12:34.252
<i>Thank you.
With the sausage, though,</i>

12:34.253 --> 12:35.253
it's a little bit over salty.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.420
Okay.

12:36.421 --> 12:39.123
I like the generosity
of this dish,

12:39.124 --> 12:41.192
but I don't think
it needed the second meat.

12:41.193 --> 12:42.927
<i>I have to agree with Hugh.</i>

12:42.928 --> 12:43.895
The pork is the star
of the show.

12:43.896 --> 12:46.097
Value wasn't gonna come
in a sausage.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.732
David, how much
would you be willing

12:47.733 --> 12:48.866
to pay for this entree, please?

12:48.867 --> 12:50.001
You know, I'd probably
be willing to pay

12:50.002 --> 12:51.636
<i>33 bucks for that.</i>

12:51.637 --> 12:53.704
I'd be willing to pay $34
for this.

12:53.705 --> 12:55.606
<i>Wow. Christian, please.</i>

12:55.607 --> 12:58.709
$32.
Barbie, congratulations.

12:58.710 --> 13:00.378
<i>Average price of your dish
is $33.</i>

13:01.713 --> 13:03.514
<i>Thank you.
You have the lead.</i>

13:03.515 --> 13:04.949
I can't believe
I just got beat down by Barbie.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.484
It really hurts.
It really irks me.

13:06.485 --> 13:08.119
$33...
the price to beat.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.654
Hell, yeah.

13:09.655 --> 13:11.789
I'm feeling good.

13:11.790 --> 13:13.157
Next up,
let's go with Dana please.

13:13.158 --> 13:16.160
$33 for a pork chop?

13:16.161 --> 13:19.797
Wow.
I guess size does matter.

13:19.798 --> 13:21.265
I'm worried now,

13:21.266 --> 13:23.000
because my piece
of halibut is, like, this big.

13:23.001 --> 13:26.938
That is a panko
and herb-crusted halibut

13:26.939 --> 13:29.540
<i>over a shaved fennel salad.</i>

13:29.541 --> 13:31.008
<i>And that's a citrus
beurre blanc underneath.</i>

13:32.177 --> 13:33.778
I love that you chose halibut.

13:33.779 --> 13:35.546
The seafood
is the star of the show.

13:35.547 --> 13:37.548
Christian, how was that for you?
The fish is very nice.

13:37.549 --> 13:39.083
<i>It's a great dish.
Very fresh.</i>

13:39.084 --> 13:40.451
It's delicious. Very elegant.

13:40.452 --> 13:42.019
Thank you.

13:42.020 --> 13:43.921
Hugh, how much would you be
prepared to spend on that dish?

13:43.922 --> 13:46.157
<i>Uh, I would spend $32.
Wow.</i>

13:46.158 --> 13:47.692
Great start.
Christian, please.

13:47.693 --> 13:49.360
I would say $32 as well.
David?

13:49.361 --> 13:52.029
$38 would be
what I would pay for it.

13:52.030 --> 13:53.497
$38!

13:53.498 --> 13:55.132
Damn, that's good.

13:55.133 --> 13:58.502
<i>Dana, on average price
your dish... $34.</i>

13:58.503 --> 14:00.137
Great job.
Thank you.

14:00.138 --> 14:02.306
We have a new leader
and only one chef left.

14:02.307 --> 14:03.808
Christina, let's go please.

14:03.809 --> 14:06.577
Dana just crushed it yet again.

14:06.578 --> 14:08.446
There's not a lot
of challenges left.

14:08.447 --> 14:10.248
So I got a big hill
to climb right now.

14:10.249 --> 14:12.316
<i>I have a grilled swordfish</i>

14:12.317 --> 14:15.620
with saffron rice.
Shrimp as well.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.421
I love that broth.

14:17.422 --> 14:20.258
I feel like I'm
in the South of France.

14:20.259 --> 14:21.792
It's a very flavorful dish.

14:21.793 --> 14:23.227
<i>The brothiness
is nice with the rice.</i>

14:23.228 --> 14:25.062
<i>But I see the skin on it.</i>

14:25.063 --> 14:26.964
I might have taken that off
myself.

14:26.965 --> 14:28.799
Be careful with the skin
leaving on the plate.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.001
It doesn't look too good.

14:30.002 --> 14:31.335
Oh, come on.

14:31.336 --> 14:33.237
Definitely not good feedback
on the skin.

14:33.238 --> 14:34.338
Damn non-skin lovers.

14:34.339 --> 14:35.573
Skin is where it's at.

14:35.574 --> 14:36.974
Get your skin on.

14:36.975 --> 14:39.143
I don't agree
with all the gents here

14:39.144 --> 14:40.311
who want the skin off.

14:40.312 --> 14:41.712
<i>I think that adds flavor.</i>

14:41.713 --> 14:43.247
I like the option.
Thank you, man.

14:43.248 --> 14:44.715
Thanks for having my back
on that.

14:44.716 --> 14:46.584
Now I'm hoping Hugh Garvey

14:46.585 --> 14:49.153
will pay more
than he was willing to pay

14:49.154 --> 14:50.421
for Dana's dish.

14:50.422 --> 14:51.656
Price, please.

14:51.657 --> 14:54.525
I'd pay, um...

14:54.526 --> 14:55.993
<i>$35 for this.
Wow.</i>

14:55.994 --> 14:58.029
<i>Okay, good.</i>

14:58.030 --> 15:01.532
I never, ever, ever wish bad
on Christina,

15:01.533 --> 15:04.468
but I just hope that her dish
doesn't get as much as mine.

15:04.469 --> 15:06.103
Come on.
Christian, please.

15:06.104 --> 15:07.905
I will give $32.

15:07.906 --> 15:09.440
<i>$32.</i>

15:09.441 --> 15:11.409
It's down to the final judge.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.978
And Christina will need a price
of at least $35

15:13.979 --> 15:16.213
to tie Dana.
David, please.

15:16.214 --> 15:18.349
Um...

15:18.350 --> 15:19.884
Come on, chef Lefevre.
Come on.

15:19.885 --> 15:22.019
I just need $36 to win.

15:22.020 --> 15:23.521
Help me out here, buddy.

15:23.522 --> 15:26.157
I would probably pay...

15:32.678 --> 15:34.579
Christina is the last chef

15:34.580 --> 15:36.314
to be judged
in the profit margin challenge.

15:36.315 --> 15:38.216
David, please.
And she will need a price

15:38.217 --> 15:41.620
of at least $36
from judge David Lefevre

15:41.621 --> 15:45.123
to win the challenge
and beat close friend Dana.

15:45.124 --> 15:49.594
Um, I would probably pay...

15:49.595 --> 15:51.329
$34 for that.

15:51.330 --> 15:53.865
Christina, average price
for your dish...

15:53.866 --> 15:57.536
<i>Is $33.67.</i>

15:57.537 --> 15:58.837
Dana, congratulations.

15:58.838 --> 16:00.539
Thank you. Thank you.
Good job.

16:00.540 --> 16:02.073
Yeah!

16:02.074 --> 16:03.608
Winning a challenge is awesome,

16:03.609 --> 16:05.377
but winning a challenge
when it's down

16:05.378 --> 16:08.280
to the final four...
huge!

16:08.281 --> 16:09.648
So proud of myself.

16:09.649 --> 16:11.850
It's all me, baby.
It's all me.

16:11.851 --> 16:14.352
Ironically,
the smallest-looking portion

16:14.353 --> 16:15.820
delivered the biggest punch

16:15.821 --> 16:17.355
<i>in terms of value for money.</i>

16:17.356 --> 16:20.392
Dana, let me win a challenge
for once.

16:20.393 --> 16:22.427
I need to step it up,
I need to focus

16:22.428 --> 16:24.396
on trying to make
a good impression tonight.

16:24.397 --> 16:25.830
Judges, as always,
an absolute pleasure.

16:25.831 --> 16:27.299
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you very much.

16:27.300 --> 16:28.733
Thank you, chefs.

16:28.734 --> 16:31.403
Thank you, guys.
Good to see you.

16:31.404 --> 16:34.472
Dana, you are in
for a fantastic afternoon.

16:34.473 --> 16:36.942
<i>It's going to start off
with an amazing visit</i>

16:36.943 --> 16:39.144
to David Lefevre's restaurant.
Oh, nice.

16:39.145 --> 16:41.846
Chef David is going to treat you
to an amazing lunch.

16:41.847 --> 16:43.915
Yay.
But I also arranged for him

16:43.916 --> 16:45.951
to give you
some one-on-one time.

16:45.952 --> 16:49.187
At this stage of the game,
any form of education

16:49.188 --> 16:51.089
from experts like that
comes in handy.

16:51.090 --> 16:53.291
Oh, absolutely.
Everyone else is gonna be stuck

16:53.292 --> 16:54.859
here doing something crappy.

16:54.860 --> 16:57.329
I'm gonna be going
to an amazing lunch,

16:57.330 --> 16:59.831
getting some tips,
and it feels so right.

16:59.832 --> 17:01.132
Head upstairs.
Hurry up.

17:01.133 --> 17:03.068
Buddy, awesome.
Well done.

17:03.069 --> 17:04.636
Have fun.
Get going.

17:04.637 --> 17:05.904
Your limo's waiting.
All right. All right.

17:05.905 --> 17:07.505
Bye, guys.

17:11.510 --> 17:13.278
First of all,
I'd like to apologize

17:13.279 --> 17:14.846
ahead of what I'm
about to tell you.

17:14.847 --> 17:18.215
Because this is
a unique punishment.

17:18.217 --> 17:21.453
<i>We pride ourselves
in Hell's Kitchen</i>

17:21.454 --> 17:23.188
on looking
after the environment.

17:23.189 --> 17:24.990
So today, Christina,
Justin, and Barbie,

17:24.991 --> 17:28.960
you have the important task
of separating...

17:28.961 --> 17:31.796
And sorting out
every ounce of trash

17:31.797 --> 17:34.232
<i>in Hell's Kitchen</i>

17:34.233 --> 17:35.567
for recycling purposes,
clearly.

17:35.568 --> 17:36.735
<i>It's gonna be messy.</i>

17:36.736 --> 17:37.836
<i>It'll be disgusting.</i>

17:37.837 --> 17:39.237
Once you've gone

17:39.238 --> 17:41.506
<i>through sorting out bags
of trash,</i>

17:41.507 --> 17:44.276
get showered, and get your asses
back in the kitchen,

17:44.277 --> 17:46.011
<i>'cause I'm opening
Hell's Kitchen tonight.</i>

17:46.012 --> 17:47.245
Got it, Barbie?
Yes, chef.

17:47.246 --> 17:48.580
<i>Justin?
Yes, chef.</i>

17:48.581 --> 17:50.115
<i>Christina?
Yes, chef.</i>

17:50.116 --> 17:52.217
Get outside. Your trash bags
are waiting you.

17:52.218 --> 17:54.352
Let's go.

17:54.353 --> 17:57.422
The punishment today
is a really, real bad one.

17:57.423 --> 17:59.591
Oh, .

17:59.592 --> 18:03.528
And I've been through a
handful of pretty bad punishments,

18:03.529 --> 18:06.398
but this is a whole new level
of disgusting.

18:07.933 --> 18:10.702
I would give Clemenza
a head-to-toe bath

18:10.703 --> 18:13.672
if I didn't have to go
in that dumpster today.

18:18.544 --> 18:20.679
This is absolutely horrifying.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.947
It's gross.
I'm seeing nasty scallops

18:22.948 --> 18:24.349
and old artichokes.

18:24.350 --> 18:26.217
It smells
like the most putrid thing

18:26.218 --> 18:28.019
you ever smelled in your life.

18:28.020 --> 18:29.020
There's no way
I can even go near that.

18:29.021 --> 18:30.021
<i>I'm not even kidding.</i>

18:30.022 --> 18:32.390
I'll definitely throw up.
Seriously?

18:32.391 --> 18:34.125
This is what every Friday
is like.

18:34.126 --> 18:35.894
Waste, vegetable,
oil, and compost.

18:35.895 --> 18:37.162
I do this at home.

18:37.163 --> 18:38.830
You get familiar
with the smell.

18:38.831 --> 18:41.066
And there's all different kinds
of smells.

18:41.067 --> 18:44.235
You know, like, "dairy" air,

18:44.236 --> 18:46.104
so get over it.

18:46.105 --> 18:47.172
What?

18:47.173 --> 18:50.141
Oh, .

18:50.142 --> 18:51.710
You're a dumpster diver.

18:51.711 --> 18:53.645
<i>Barbie, I like your goggles.
Thank you.</i>

18:53.646 --> 18:55.914
I'm glad Dana's leaving.

18:55.915 --> 18:57.882
She would have done nothing
but whine

18:57.883 --> 19:00.518
and cry and bitch and moan

19:00.519 --> 19:03.321
and make me want to throw her
in the dumpster.

19:03.322 --> 19:06.791
While the losers work
on their recycling skills...

19:06.792 --> 19:09.394
Dana arrives
at chef Lefevre's restaurant

19:09.395 --> 19:11.129
for her one-on-one
cooking lessons.

19:11.130 --> 19:12.464
<i>Dana.
Hi.</i>

19:12.465 --> 19:13.732
Welcome.

19:13.733 --> 19:15.400
I have the whole restaurant
to myself?

19:15.401 --> 19:16.334
<i>Come on in.
Come on in.</i>

19:16.335 --> 19:17.469
Congratulations, huh?
Thank you.

19:17.470 --> 19:19.104
Thank you so much.
Dish was amazing.

19:19.105 --> 19:20.905
I want to welcome you
to Manhattan Beach Post.

19:20.906 --> 19:22.507
<i>It's beautiful.
Do a little cooking</i>

19:22.508 --> 19:23.708
if that's all right with you.
Sounds perfect.

19:23.709 --> 19:24.943
Awesome. Come this way.
Yeah.

19:24.944 --> 19:26.544
It's just
a beautiful restaurant.

19:26.545 --> 19:28.313
I'm excited to see the kitchen

19:28.314 --> 19:31.516
and just jump in
and start cooking.

19:31.517 --> 19:34.753
So one of the dishes
that we sell a ton of

19:34.754 --> 19:37.722
is our vietnamese
curried mussels.

19:37.723 --> 19:39.157
To have this one-on-one time

19:39.158 --> 19:42.394
with chef Lefevre is amazing.

19:42.395 --> 19:45.163
This is a Michelin-star chef
giving me

19:45.164 --> 19:47.866
a private cooking lesson.
There you go.

19:47.867 --> 19:49.534
Right,
and then a half ladle of that.

19:49.535 --> 19:51.603
We're gonna let that steam.

19:51.604 --> 19:53.805
<i>Perfect.
Oh, it smells so good.</i>

19:57.643 --> 19:59.844
Ugh, there are so many maggots
in here.

19:59.845 --> 20:01.746
Oh, my God.
Ugh.

20:01.747 --> 20:03.415
Oh, that's nasty.

20:06.252 --> 20:08.520
If you puke, just make sure you
do it in the organic one,

20:08.521 --> 20:10.789
<i>all right?
Really?</i>

20:10.790 --> 20:12.357
That's what I'm thinking about
right now.

20:12.358 --> 20:13.258
I'm gonna recycle my throw-up.

20:17.863 --> 20:20.331
Justin is definitely
the baby of the group today.

20:20.332 --> 20:22.934
The last thing I want
is for Justin to puke

20:22.935 --> 20:24.903
all over something
we're gonna have to clean up.

20:24.904 --> 20:26.504
If there's maggots,
I'll take it.

20:26.505 --> 20:28.840
I'm gonna go over here.

20:28.841 --> 20:31.476
While Justin tries
to keep his lunch down...

20:31.477 --> 20:34.813
Dana is anxious to enjoy hers.

20:34.814 --> 20:36.548
Perfect.
Okay, you put that back.

20:36.549 --> 20:38.016
A good squeeze over there.

20:38.017 --> 20:39.784
Can we go eat it now?

20:39.785 --> 20:41.953
Actually, I think I've got
some people in the restaurant

20:41.954 --> 20:43.288
that we can serve it to up front
if you're cool with that.

20:43.289 --> 20:44.122
I'm sure they'd be psyched
if you were there.

20:44.123 --> 20:45.190
What?
What?

20:45.191 --> 20:46.925
Dude, I'm starving.

20:46.926 --> 20:48.726
I thought this was just for me.

20:48.727 --> 20:50.428
You can set it right down
in the middle of the table.

20:50.429 --> 20:51.696
You just never know

20:51.697 --> 20:55.433
what's gonna be next.

20:55.434 --> 20:56.734
Oh, really?

20:56.735 --> 20:58.870
<i>They said
there were some guests</i>

20:58.871 --> 21:00.939
in the dining room
that needed to be served.

21:00.940 --> 21:04.442
These two guests
aren't just any two guests.

21:04.443 --> 21:06.811
They're my parents!

21:06.812 --> 21:08.580
I was not expecting this
at all.

21:08.581 --> 21:10.148
Just enjoy, relax,
and have a good time.

21:10.149 --> 21:10.949
Wonderful.
Thank you.

21:10.950 --> 21:12.717
This is amazing.

21:12.718 --> 21:14.552
It's always better to win
in Hell's Kitchen.

21:14.553 --> 21:15.587
Cheers, Dana.
We're so proud of you.

21:15.588 --> 21:17.021
You're just amazing.

21:17.022 --> 21:18.289
This feels so good.

21:18.290 --> 21:20.425
I can't believe my parents

21:20.426 --> 21:22.293
are sitting here with me,
but, at the same time,

21:22.294 --> 21:23.761
I'm thinking,
"don't lose focus.

21:23.762 --> 21:26.798
"You need to get back in there
and go kick some ass tonight."

21:26.799 --> 21:28.466
Dana, go for it.

21:28.467 --> 21:29.801
All right.
I do every day.

21:29.802 --> 21:31.236
I know.
I'm proud of you.

21:31.237 --> 21:33.271
Bye.
Love you.

21:33.272 --> 21:35.573
Bye. Love you.
Love you.

21:35.574 --> 21:38.810
While Dana's lunch
with her family comes to an end...

21:38.811 --> 21:43.248
Her three competitors are busy
prepping for tonight's service.

21:43.249 --> 21:45.817
Dude, why do I keep smelling
that garbage?

21:45.818 --> 21:47.519
It's probably stuck in...
it's somewhere on you.

21:47.520 --> 21:48.686
I have...

21:48.687 --> 21:50.722
it can't be.
I changed, I showered.

21:50.723 --> 21:52.056
I scrubbed the
out of myself.

21:52.057 --> 21:53.691
I don't get it.

21:53.692 --> 21:54.826
Hi, guys.

21:54.827 --> 21:57.362
Hey, buddy.

21:57.363 --> 21:58.730
It was so fun.

21:58.731 --> 22:00.231
I got to see my mama and dada.

22:00.232 --> 22:01.499
I got to eat and cook too.

22:01.500 --> 22:04.068
Come on, Dana.
Now I'm annoyed.

22:04.069 --> 22:07.372
The last thing I want to hear
is how great the reward was.

22:07.373 --> 22:10.475
We have been here
busting our ass all day long.

22:10.476 --> 22:12.043
<i>Please tell me regular menu.</i>

22:13.279 --> 22:15.380
<i>Regular menu?</i>

22:15.381 --> 22:17.248
<i>Regular menu?</i>

22:17.249 --> 22:20.218
I don't know, I feel like
nobody's, like, talking to me.

22:20.219 --> 22:22.387
Everyone is totally ignoring me.

22:22.388 --> 22:23.855
Even Christina.

22:23.856 --> 22:25.523
It's weird.

22:25.524 --> 22:27.025
I don't know what I did
to deserve this.

22:27.026 --> 22:28.459
Come on, Christina.

22:28.460 --> 22:30.194
What the
is your problem?

22:37.986 --> 22:40.154
An hour before dinner service,

22:40.155 --> 22:43.657
Dana returns from a warm,
wonderful day with her parents.

22:43.658 --> 22:46.293
I don't know, I feel like
nobody's, like, talking to me.

22:46.294 --> 22:49.196
But she gets a chilly
reception from her fellow chefs.

22:49.197 --> 22:51.698
What the
is your problem?

22:51.699 --> 22:53.300
No more friendships.

22:53.301 --> 22:55.235
It's not about friendships
anymore, so it's time

22:55.236 --> 22:57.137
to step it up, and this
service could determine

22:57.138 --> 22:58.605
our fate in Hell's Kitchen.

22:58.606 --> 23:00.407
Line up quickly,
quickly, quick.

23:00.408 --> 23:03.310
Okay, tonight
you're gonna be tested

23:03.311 --> 23:04.611
on your leadership skills.

23:04.612 --> 23:06.814
<i>Each of you will have a turn</i>

23:06.815 --> 23:09.716
running the pass.

23:12.687 --> 23:15.556
Damn, homey,
I'm about to run the pass.

23:15.557 --> 23:16.890
This is huge.

23:16.891 --> 23:18.425
If you can't do this,

23:18.426 --> 23:20.227
how are you gonna run
a brigade of 40 chefs?

23:20.228 --> 23:22.329
This, for me, is one
of the most important tests.

23:22.330 --> 23:23.897
This will really establish
the difference

23:23.898 --> 23:25.465
between a cook and a chef.

23:25.466 --> 23:27.367
<i>One more thing,
and listen carefully...</i>

23:27.368 --> 23:28.669
tonight is an even
bigger night for you all

23:28.670 --> 23:31.104
<i>because the president
of Paris Las Vegas,</i>

23:31.105 --> 23:33.907
Mr. David hoenemeyer,
is gracing us with his presence.

23:33.908 --> 23:36.343
So you do not want to screw up.
Let me tell you that.

23:36.344 --> 23:37.778
Service of our life.

23:37.779 --> 23:40.147
This is huge.
Like, I have to put out

23:40.148 --> 23:42.783
my best all night long
to prove that I'm worthy

23:42.784 --> 23:43.951
of that position in Vegas.

23:43.952 --> 23:45.385
Tonight, I want to see

23:45.386 --> 23:47.221
who has the natural ability

23:47.222 --> 23:48.622
<i>to become a great leader.</i>

23:48.623 --> 23:50.057
Got it?
Yes, chef.

23:50.058 --> 23:51.425
<i>Let's go.</i>

23:51.426 --> 23:52.893
James.
Yes, chef.

23:52.894 --> 23:54.127
Open Hell's Kitchen, please.
Let's go.

23:54.128 --> 23:55.696
Yes, chef.

23:57.000 --> 24:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

24:04.105 --> 24:06.473
Tonight will be a true test

24:06.474 --> 24:08.275
of each of the chefs'
leadership abilities.

24:08.276 --> 24:09.743
These are gonna take longer too.

24:09.744 --> 24:11.078
They're way bigger than usual.

24:11.079 --> 24:12.112
Chef Ramsay is looking

24:12.113 --> 24:13.614
to see who can run
the kitchen...

24:13.615 --> 24:15.349
Let's go, guys.
Come on.

24:15.350 --> 24:16.984
While
maintaining the highest

24:16.985 --> 24:17.951
of standards.
Okay, look at me.

24:17.952 --> 24:19.453
Tonight, step up to the plate
and lead.

24:19.454 --> 24:21.288
Yes, chef.
Scott and Andi

24:21.289 --> 24:23.090
are gonna jump in
on the sections

24:23.091 --> 24:24.791
and help, so we get
the momentum going, okay?

24:24.792 --> 24:26.593
On order: Three risotto,
one Caesar salad.

24:26.594 --> 24:28.128
Yes, chef. How long?

24:28.129 --> 24:29.830
I got seven minutes, chef.
Seven minutes.

24:29.831 --> 24:30.964
Let's go.
This dinner service,

24:30.965 --> 24:32.399
really everything's
at stake.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.201
We've all made it this far.

24:34.202 --> 24:35.769
We're all gonna come out
fighting something fierce.

24:35.770 --> 24:37.337
So I have to push myself

24:37.338 --> 24:38.805
and I need to really be
on point tonight.

24:38.806 --> 24:39.706
Christina, risotto.

24:39.707 --> 24:41.174
I'm hoping it's there, yes?

24:41.175 --> 24:43.510
90 seconds.
Justin, Caesar salad, please.

24:43.511 --> 24:45.379
Yes, chef.

24:45.380 --> 24:47.080
Is that all three?
Three.

24:49.217 --> 24:51.385
That's delicious.
With chef Ramsay

24:51.386 --> 24:52.920
getting the kitchen
out of the starting gate...

24:52.921 --> 24:55.022
Service, please.

24:55.023 --> 24:57.190
And appetizers leaving
quickly out of the kitchen...

24:57.191 --> 24:58.959
Justin, on the hot plate now.
Yes, chef.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.061
<i>Christina,
take over the garnish.</i>

25:01.062 --> 25:02.829
Scott, take over the apps
please, thank you.

25:02.830 --> 25:03.797
Chef Ramsay is ready

25:03.798 --> 25:04.965
to hand the reins over
to Justin.

25:04.966 --> 25:06.466
Now look at me.

25:06.467 --> 25:08.068
<i>Read the ticket.
Get the attention</i>

25:08.069 --> 25:08.535
of your brigade.
Come on.

25:09.871 --> 25:11.238
<i>Three scallops,
one lobster spaghetti,</i>

25:11.239 --> 25:12.139
two bass, two cod, order.

25:12.140 --> 25:13.774
Yes, chef.

25:13.775 --> 25:15.409
My strategy at the pass
is to just drive the food.

25:15.410 --> 25:17.144
How long?
Two minutes on the risotto.

25:17.145 --> 25:18.679
Garnish.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.747
I'm just trying to make sure
everything's done properly,

25:20.748 --> 25:21.548
make sure everything's
done perfectly,

25:21.549 --> 25:22.683
and get the food to the diner.

25:22.684 --> 25:24.017
Service, please.
Appetizers, table 61.

25:24.018 --> 25:25.085
Justin is off to a solid start.

25:25.086 --> 25:27.087
Good flavor.
Mm.

25:27.088 --> 25:29.923
But his quality
control is about to be tested...

25:29.924 --> 25:31.158
Coming.

25:31.159 --> 25:32.960
As chef Scott sabotages him

25:32.961 --> 25:34.962
by putting crab
in the lobster spaghetti.

25:34.963 --> 25:36.196
Lobster spaghetti.
How long?

25:36.197 --> 25:37.931
Spaghetti right now.

25:37.932 --> 25:40.334
I'm taking everything I've
learned since I've been here.

25:40.335 --> 25:41.535
I'm tasting every single thing
that's come to that pass.

25:41.536 --> 25:43.303
What is that?
Crab.

25:44.706 --> 25:46.340
Lobster spaghetti, chef.
Not crab.

25:46.341 --> 25:47.741
Let's go, Justin.
Come here.

25:47.742 --> 25:49.343
<i>Oui, chef.</i>

25:49.344 --> 25:50.410
Good catch.

25:50.411 --> 25:52.012
Look at me.
Now you understand

25:52.013 --> 25:54.047
the importance, yes,
of tasting everything.

25:54.048 --> 25:55.749
Well done.
Really well done.

25:55.750 --> 25:57.451
I'm not gonna let anything
slide by me.

25:57.452 --> 25:59.019
There's no way
it's gonna happen.

25:59.020 --> 26:00.921
With Justin
acing test number one...

26:00.922 --> 26:02.789
Chef, how long
for this refire of spaghetti?

26:02.790 --> 26:04.291
I need another one
right after, right?

26:04.292 --> 26:06.093
Six minutes.

26:06.094 --> 26:07.961
He now has to contend

26:07.962 --> 26:09.963
with sending out entrees
as well as appetizers.

26:09.964 --> 26:12.265
Let's go. VIP table: Three
scallops, one lobster spaghetti,

26:12.266 --> 26:14.301
entree two bass,
two Wellington.

26:14.302 --> 26:15.769
<i>Wellington, two bass.</i>

26:15.770 --> 26:17.404
Dana, answer me.

26:17.405 --> 26:19.039
Yes, chef.

26:20.108 --> 26:22.909
Justin's being so annoying.

26:22.910 --> 26:25.412
I mean, take a deep breath
or something.

26:25.413 --> 26:27.214
How long?
Six minutes.

26:27.215 --> 26:29.249
Six... five minutes.
I need it in five.

26:29.250 --> 26:30.851
It's gonna take six.

26:30.852 --> 26:33.120
It's my five minutes.
Come on. Get it together.

26:33.121 --> 26:34.521
It really irks me to know

26:34.522 --> 26:35.756
that Dana's dragging on fish

26:35.757 --> 26:37.224
and doesn't really seem
to care.

26:37.225 --> 26:38.859
She's not gonna get fast
at all.

26:38.860 --> 26:39.993
I'm waiting
for first table.

26:39.994 --> 26:41.728
Scallops.
Spaghetti ready.

26:41.729 --> 26:43.630
Walking with Welly.
Walking with Welly garnish.

26:43.631 --> 26:44.831
Where's those bass?
Three minutes.

26:44.832 --> 26:46.266
I need it now.
We're dying.

26:46.267 --> 26:48.869
It's gonna be ready
when it's ready.

26:48.870 --> 26:51.138
Now, young lady, so far
your attitude stinks.

26:51.139 --> 26:53.573
Come here, you.
This is his time now,

26:53.574 --> 26:55.275
and he's driving the team.
Yes, chef.

26:55.276 --> 26:56.810
So it is your time
or his time?

26:56.811 --> 26:57.811
It's his time...
well, okay then.

26:57.812 --> 26:59.980
Move your ass.
Yes, chef.

26:59.981 --> 27:01.448
Your biggest problem
is Dana's time,

27:01.449 --> 27:02.716
not the restaurant's time.

27:02.717 --> 27:04.684
<i>You haven't sorted out
the difference in your mind.</i>

27:04.685 --> 27:06.386
It's our first table.

27:06.387 --> 27:09.056
If you've given up, go home.

27:16.437 --> 27:18.438
Tonight, chef Ramsay is testing

27:18.439 --> 27:20.274
the final four's ability
to run the kitchen.

27:20.275 --> 27:22.242
Lobster spaghetti, chef,
not crab.

27:22.243 --> 27:24.378
Good catch.
Justin easily passed

27:24.379 --> 27:25.646
his quality control test.

27:25.647 --> 27:27.014
I need it now.
We're dying.

27:27.015 --> 27:29.183
It's gonna be ready
when it's ready.

27:29.184 --> 27:31.785
But has lost control of
one of the chefs in his brigade.

27:31.786 --> 27:33.787
Young lady, if you're
doing that to sabotage him,

27:33.788 --> 27:35.889
<i>you're doing
a good job.</i>

27:35.890 --> 27:38.492
Wait, what?
I work as hard

27:38.493 --> 27:39.827
when Justin's up there

27:39.828 --> 27:41.995
as I do when anybody's
on the pass.

27:41.996 --> 27:44.064
When you stand up here,
you'll understand

27:44.065 --> 27:45.532
what the I'm saying.
It's our first table.

27:45.533 --> 27:47.334
Where's those bass?
Right here, right here.

27:47.335 --> 27:49.469
With Dana now
delivering her bass...

27:49.470 --> 27:51.605
Service please.
And Justin regaining control

27:51.606 --> 27:53.240
of the kitchen...
VIPs out.

27:53.241 --> 27:54.875
Food is once again

27:54.876 --> 27:55.709
making it out
to the dining room.

27:55.710 --> 27:57.211
Fantastic.

27:57.212 --> 27:58.745
<i>Mm.
Very good.</i>

27:58.746 --> 28:00.047
Well done.
Thank you, chef.

28:00.048 --> 28:01.515
You're on apps.
Let's go.

28:01.516 --> 28:03.784
Dana, hot plate. Let's go.
Yes, chef.

28:03.785 --> 28:05.385
I need to prove to chef Ramsay

28:05.386 --> 28:06.553
that I'm the chef
he's looking for.

28:06.554 --> 28:08.222
I need to step up

28:08.223 --> 28:10.257
and take the leadership role
that chef wants me to take.

28:10.258 --> 28:13.327
Two cod, one Wellington,

28:13.328 --> 28:14.461
<i>one strip.</i>

28:16.898 --> 28:18.932
Come here, you.
Come here. Dana, look at me.

28:18.933 --> 28:21.134
They have to respond.
Yes, chef.

28:21.135 --> 28:22.836
You are driving them.
Yes, chef.

28:22.837 --> 28:25.172
Read it again.
Guys, listen to me.

28:25.173 --> 28:27.975
Order in: Two cod,
one Wellington, one strip.

28:27.976 --> 28:29.476
Heard.
Yes, chef.

28:29.477 --> 28:31.011
Good. That's better.
How long?

28:31.012 --> 28:32.646
One Wellington, one strip...
three minutes.

28:32.647 --> 28:34.014
Three minutes, heard.

28:34.015 --> 28:35.549
Followed by one risotto,
one scallop.

28:35.550 --> 28:37.451
<i>Dropping a scallop.
risotto dropped.</i>

28:37.452 --> 28:38.852
Two minutes
to the window, please.

28:38.853 --> 28:40.654
I am going to run this kitchen.

28:40.655 --> 28:43.757
This kitchen is not going
to run me.

28:43.758 --> 28:45.359
Can I get garnish
in the window, please?

28:45.360 --> 28:46.660
Yup.
Garnish behind you.

28:46.661 --> 28:48.896
Coming in.
Service, please.

28:48.897 --> 28:51.565
With Dana having
a firm grip on the kitchen,

28:51.566 --> 28:53.934
food continues to leave
at a steady pace.

28:53.935 --> 28:55.435
Justin, how long
on the risotto?

28:55.436 --> 28:57.004
Walking right now.
Thank you.

28:57.005 --> 28:59.740
Leave the risotto here.
risotto here.

28:59.741 --> 29:02.209
But she's about to
face her quality control test.

29:02.210 --> 29:05.412
As chef Ramsay slips some sugar
into the risotto.

29:05.413 --> 29:07.714
I'll dress scallops,
you do the two risotto, yes?

29:07.715 --> 29:10.450
Okay.

29:10.451 --> 29:13.253
It's coming.
Calamari's right behind you.

29:13.254 --> 29:15.289
Stop.
Taste that.

29:15.290 --> 29:16.690
I tasted this one.
This one was cooked.

29:16.691 --> 29:18.525
Taste again for me.

29:18.526 --> 29:21.228
Oh, that was made with sugar.

29:21.229 --> 29:23.063
Yeah, I didn't catch that.
Sugar!

29:23.064 --> 29:24.932
I'm an idiot.
I should have tasted it.

29:24.933 --> 29:26.333
Come on then.

29:26.334 --> 29:28.201
Fire two more then.
Get some spirit in you.

29:28.202 --> 29:29.136
I need you to fire
two more risotto please.

29:29.137 --> 29:30.437
<i>Oui, chef.</i>

29:30.438 --> 29:32.906
I got to figure out
what to do up here

29:32.907 --> 29:35.108
to make myself turn around
and to get better

29:35.109 --> 29:37.077
at this, because I'm not
gonna stand up here

29:37.078 --> 29:38.745
at the pass and fail.
I'm not.

29:38.746 --> 29:40.180
How long on the risotto?

29:40.181 --> 29:41.348
Right here.
Right here, chef.

29:41.349 --> 29:42.783
<i>Let's go.
Behind you.</i>

29:42.784 --> 29:44.751
<i>It's behind you, chef.
Hot.</i>

29:45.787 --> 29:47.554
<i>Justin. Yes.</i>

29:47.555 --> 29:49.056
Good job on that risotto.
Tastes good.

29:49.057 --> 29:50.390
Thank you.

29:50.391 --> 29:51.892
It's an hour and a half

29:51.893 --> 29:53.060
into dinner service,
and, after stumbling

29:53.061 --> 29:54.594
on her quality control test,

29:54.595 --> 29:57.197
Dana has put in
a strong performance.

29:57.198 --> 29:58.565
That's really good.

29:58.566 --> 30:00.200
Barbie, join me
at the hot plate.

30:00.201 --> 30:01.468
Yes, chef.

30:01.469 --> 30:03.270
Now it's up to Barbie

30:03.271 --> 30:05.505
to show what she can do
as the head chef.

30:05.506 --> 30:07.407
Look at me. There's one way
driving this kitchen.

30:07.408 --> 30:08.742
It's your way.
Yes, chef.

30:08.743 --> 30:10.544
You understand?
Off you go.

30:10.545 --> 30:12.913
Order in!
One risotto, one scallops,

30:12.914 --> 30:16.550
followed by one scallops,
one Caesar.

30:16.551 --> 30:19.419
One Wellington,
one New York strip.

30:19.420 --> 30:21.355
I'm so confused.

30:21.356 --> 30:22.656
Barbie, we're over here.

30:22.657 --> 30:24.091
And the guests are over there.

30:24.092 --> 30:25.859
What the hell are you doing?

30:25.860 --> 30:28.362
We can't hear you
when you're not looking at us.

30:28.363 --> 30:30.163
What are you doing?
You don't shout out there.

30:30.164 --> 30:31.498
You take the ticket there,

30:31.499 --> 30:32.632
and you command
to your brigade.

30:32.633 --> 30:34.468
One risotto, one scallop,

30:34.469 --> 30:36.336
followed by one scallops,
one Caesar.

30:36.337 --> 30:38.472
One Wellington,
one New York strip.

30:38.473 --> 30:39.873
Yes, chef.

30:39.874 --> 30:41.942
The hardest thing
about running the pass

30:41.943 --> 30:43.610
is trusting that everyone
back there has your back.

30:43.611 --> 30:45.379
I'm walking risotto
in 30 seconds.

30:45.380 --> 30:47.147
Dropping scallops.
I'm gonna take control

30:47.148 --> 30:48.648
and do what I have to do.

30:48.649 --> 30:50.150
Chef's looking
for a leader tonight.

30:50.151 --> 30:51.284
I plan on bringing him one.

30:51.285 --> 30:53.053
How long?
15 seconds.

30:53.054 --> 30:54.855
Scallops are following.
risotto's in the window, chef.

30:54.856 --> 30:55.956
<i>Come on, Dana.</i>

30:55.957 --> 30:58.025
Move.

30:58.026 --> 31:00.127
Two scallops.

31:00.128 --> 31:02.095
Potato puree going up
right now.

31:02.096 --> 31:03.830
Taste that.

31:03.831 --> 31:05.599
Justin, too much white wine.

31:05.600 --> 31:07.401
Okay.

31:07.402 --> 31:09.036
Talk to fish about that refire
on that risotto.

31:09.037 --> 31:10.103
I'm walking in 20 seconds.

31:11.539 --> 31:13.940
Refire. Did you talk to
scallops about that?

31:13.941 --> 31:15.976
Justin's not talking with Dana,

31:15.977 --> 31:18.745
so she doesn't know
she needs four scallops all day.

31:18.746 --> 31:20.614
So we're dragging a Caesar salad
and a scallops.

31:20.615 --> 31:22.182
Caesar salad,
scallops, how long?

31:22.183 --> 31:24.184
Dana, how long
for the scallops?

31:24.185 --> 31:26.019
They're not even working
in tandem.

31:26.020 --> 31:27.821
This is your chance now.
Hey, you, come here.

31:27.822 --> 31:29.256
<i>Hey, you, come here, you.</i>

31:29.257 --> 31:30.657
Come on, guys,
pull it together.

31:30.658 --> 31:32.559
I need you guys
to talk to each other.

31:32.560 --> 31:34.194
I need a salad from you,
and I need scallops from you.

31:34.195 --> 31:35.462
Yes.
Two minutes.

31:35.463 --> 31:36.963
Two minutes.
What the hell?

31:36.964 --> 31:39.599
Train wreck.
Train wreck.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.034
Caesar in my hand, chef.

31:41.035 --> 31:42.636
My salad is up.
I need those scallops.

31:42.637 --> 31:44.071
They're coming right now.

31:44.072 --> 31:45.439
With Barbie working

31:45.440 --> 31:47.140
through the communication
breakdown

31:47.141 --> 31:49.042
between Justin and Dana...
Go, John.

31:49.043 --> 31:50.877
The kitchen is back on track.

31:50.878 --> 31:52.946
Fire table 24.
Four Wellington away.

31:52.947 --> 31:54.381
Walking with Welly behind.

31:54.382 --> 31:56.216
Potato puree going up
right now.

31:56.217 --> 31:59.019
But the night
is not getting any easier,

31:59.020 --> 32:01.388
as chef Scott brings his quality
control test to the pass,

32:01.389 --> 32:04.724
delivering celeriac mash
instead of mashed potatoes.

32:04.725 --> 32:06.460
This puree doesn't look right.

32:08.996 --> 32:11.465
Chef Scott,
these aren't potatoes.

32:11.466 --> 32:13.533
Tastes like celeriac.

32:13.534 --> 32:16.470
Celeriac instead
of mashed potatoes.

32:16.471 --> 32:18.705
Like, please.
I know what I'm doing.

32:18.706 --> 32:20.674
Good. Well spotted.
Let's go.

32:20.675 --> 32:22.142
Okay. I need
two Wellington,

32:22.143 --> 32:23.877
one cod, one New York strip.

32:23.878 --> 32:26.046
Yes, chef.
Walking right now.

32:26.047 --> 32:28.548
Catching chef Scott's
sabotage has allowed Barbie...

32:28.549 --> 32:30.417
Right behind, right behind,
right behind.

32:30.418 --> 32:31.518
Coming with the cod garnish
right now.

32:31.519 --> 32:32.752
Thank you.
Service, please.

32:32.753 --> 32:34.087
To finish her turn at the pass

32:34.088 --> 32:35.388
on a positive note.

32:35.389 --> 32:36.656
Wow, that's really good.

32:36.657 --> 32:38.358
Okay, Barbie, well done.

32:38.359 --> 32:39.726
I think I fared pretty well

32:39.727 --> 32:41.094
leading the brigade tonight.

32:41.095 --> 32:42.929
Chef was looking
for leadership skills,

32:42.930 --> 32:44.498
and I believe I did that.

32:44.499 --> 32:46.099
Christina, in the window,
let's go.

32:46.100 --> 32:47.167
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

32:47.168 --> 32:48.768
Look at me.
Organize it, and run your team.

32:48.769 --> 32:50.704
Yes, chef. Two cod,
one Welly, one strip.

32:50.705 --> 32:52.272
<i>How long?
Four minutes.</i>

32:52.273 --> 32:54.441
Four minutes, okay.
I'm pumped.

32:54.442 --> 32:56.743
If there's a gear past fifth,
I'm there.

32:56.744 --> 32:59.146
Dana, how long?
I'm ready when garnish is ready.

32:59.147 --> 33:00.947
Barbie, how long do you need?
Two minutes.

33:00.948 --> 33:02.649
Dana, I'll see you
in 2 1/2 minutes.

33:02.650 --> 33:04.484
Finally, a voice
on the hot plate.

33:04.485 --> 33:06.486
I don't really feel nervous.
I feel confident.

33:06.487 --> 33:07.854
And I'm ready to go.

33:07.855 --> 33:09.589
Dana, is your fish
looking okay?

33:09.590 --> 33:10.690
Give me two minutes, please.

33:10.691 --> 33:11.892
<i>Come on, buddy.</i>

33:11.893 --> 33:13.593
No, no.
When was the last time,

33:13.594 --> 33:15.362
you heard me call
one of my brigade "buddy"?

33:15.363 --> 33:17.364
Dana, please, bring the cod.

33:17.365 --> 33:18.932
<i>Bringing the cod.
I don't know about that, Dana.</i>

33:18.933 --> 33:20.400
Are these too burnt?

33:20.401 --> 33:21.735
Dana, come on.

33:21.736 --> 33:23.670
Christina, the cod,
it's burnt underneath.

33:23.671 --> 33:24.838
<i>I have to redo it.</i>

33:24.839 --> 33:25.906
You don't have another one?

33:25.907 --> 33:27.107
No, I need four minutes.

33:27.108 --> 33:28.308
Forget the friendship.
Let's go.

33:28.309 --> 33:29.743
Dana, push that.
Yup, yup.

33:29.744 --> 33:31.178
As soon as it's ready,
I'll get it to you.

33:31.179 --> 33:32.646
<i>Fine, look at me.
Yes, chef.</i>

33:32.647 --> 33:33.914
You have to run the brigade.

33:33.915 --> 33:35.282
Right now, they're running you.

33:35.283 --> 33:36.883
Yes, chef.
Dana, you're killing me

33:36.884 --> 33:38.618
right now.
I love you, girl.

33:38.619 --> 33:40.053
I love you to death,
but I need that fish.

33:40.054 --> 33:41.721
Wellington ready.
New York ready.

33:41.722 --> 33:43.390
Dana, walking.
Walking right now.

33:44.625 --> 33:46.159
You're joking.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.727
Cod's undercooked.

33:47.728 --> 33:49.563
Get her up here.
Dana.

33:49.564 --> 33:51.298
Come here. It's under.
Get it back in the oven

33:51.299 --> 33:53.500
for another 90 seconds, please.

33:53.501 --> 33:55.268
Nothing here again.

33:55.269 --> 33:57.170
<i>Nothing's coming out!
Dana, I need that cod!</i>

33:57.171 --> 33:58.805
Coming back right now
with that cod.

33:58.806 --> 34:00.173
So let's just go then.

34:00.174 --> 34:01.908
<i>I need 60 seconds.
Hurry up!</i>

34:01.909 --> 34:03.543
Make it 45, Dana.
Come on.

34:03.544 --> 34:05.378
Right now, we're .
We're .

34:05.379 --> 34:07.013
Where's that cod, Dana?
I need it walking.

34:13.514 --> 34:15.815
It's two hours
into dinner service,

34:15.817 --> 34:17.650
and Christina is getting
her turn at running the pass.

34:17.652 --> 34:19.753
Now Dana's up.
Nothing's here.

34:19.754 --> 34:21.889
But her inability
to get a piece of cod

34:21.889 --> 34:23.491
from her good friend Dana

34:23.492 --> 34:25.659
has brought the kitchen
to a grinding halt.

34:25.659 --> 34:26.927
Dana, I need that cod.

34:26.928 --> 34:28.661
<i>I need 60 seconds.
Hurry up!</i>

34:28.663 --> 34:30.297
Make it 45, Dana.
Come on.

34:30.297 --> 34:32.132
Right now, we're .
We're .

34:32.134 --> 34:34.935
Where's that cod, Dana?
I need it walking.

34:34.936 --> 34:36.971
Buddy, hey, a little high-five,
a little hug it out?

34:36.972 --> 34:38.239
<i>No, that.
We're now.</i>

34:38.239 --> 34:40.174
Serious, like,
this late in the game,

34:40.175 --> 34:42.009
like, the quality of food
you're putting out?

34:42.010 --> 34:42.909
At this point,
I don't even give

34:42.911 --> 34:44.043
a about friendship.

34:44.045 --> 34:45.179
Dana, I need those cod.

34:45.179 --> 34:47.148
Walking with cod.
Walk quickly.

34:47.149 --> 34:48.949
you.
Chef's right.

34:48.949 --> 34:50.551
This is a competition.
Go ahead and sink yourself.

34:50.552 --> 34:51.784
I want to win.

34:51.786 --> 34:53.187
You have two in your hand,
right?

34:53.188 --> 34:54.255
<i>Two, yes.
Come on.</i>

34:54.255 --> 34:55.989
<i>We're just .</i>

34:55.991 --> 34:57.123
Your timing's way off tonight.

34:57.125 --> 34:58.192
Go, please.

34:58.193 --> 35:00.528
Last two tables.
Let's go.

35:00.529 --> 35:02.997
Christina's assertiveness
has clearly paid off...

35:02.998 --> 35:04.565
Chef Scott, I'm ready
for that Welly and strip.

35:04.566 --> 35:07.168
As the kitchen only
suffered a minor slowdown.

35:07.169 --> 35:08.202
New York, Wellington.

35:08.203 --> 35:09.403
Garnish.

35:09.404 --> 35:11.038
Now chef Ramsay will see

35:11.039 --> 35:12.806
if her quality control
is up to par,

35:12.807 --> 35:15.309
as he delivers
an arugula garnish

35:15.310 --> 35:17.278
instead of spinach.
Thank you, chef.

35:17.279 --> 35:19.713
What the is this?
Is this arugula?

35:19.714 --> 35:21.982
Are you kidding me?
It's arugula.

35:21.983 --> 35:23.117
There's no way that's spinach.

35:23.118 --> 35:24.518
<i>Come on, man.</i>

35:24.519 --> 35:26.587
That's more like it.
Well spotted.

35:26.588 --> 35:29.657
If there is one thing that
chef Ramsay has driven home,

35:29.658 --> 35:31.959
it's that you check everything.

35:31.960 --> 35:34.161
So there's no way
I'm gonna let this slide.

35:34.162 --> 35:35.863
<i>Go, please.</i>

35:35.864 --> 35:38.432
After catching the garnish swap,

35:38.433 --> 35:40.134
Christina sends the final
entrees out to the dining room.

35:40.135 --> 35:42.303
Great.
Delish.

35:42.304 --> 35:45.673
Well done.
Stoves off. Let's go.

35:45.674 --> 35:47.408
Line up there.
I want to chat with you.

35:47.409 --> 35:49.109
<i>Quickly.</i>

35:49.110 --> 35:51.845
Okay.
I want you to go upstairs

35:51.846 --> 35:54.248
<i>and have
a bloody good discussion</i>

35:54.249 --> 35:56.050
on who deserves to stay

35:56.051 --> 35:59.086
and who deserves to go home.

35:59.087 --> 36:00.588
Understand?
Yes, chef.

36:00.589 --> 36:02.556
Yeah?
Off you go.

36:02.557 --> 36:04.992
There's only four of us left.

36:04.993 --> 36:07.161
We're down to the best,
and everyone has to be able

36:07.162 --> 36:09.430
to hold their stations down.

36:09.431 --> 36:11.365
And I don't believe Dana did.

36:11.366 --> 36:13.567
She couldn't work her station,
and she couldn't work the pass.

36:13.568 --> 36:15.936
She was not able
to handle that pressure.

36:18.673 --> 36:21.041
Let's just vote
and get it over with.

36:21.042 --> 36:26.046
I feel like nobody stood out
as, like, bad.

36:26.047 --> 36:28.015
What the
are you talking about?

36:28.016 --> 36:31.252
You messed up.
Own up to it.

36:31.253 --> 36:34.955
Dana sucked horribly,
so it's over.

36:34.956 --> 36:37.691
Dana, you drug on the ticket...

36:37.692 --> 36:40.060
oh, one minute, though.

36:40.061 --> 36:42.796
I can't make it cook faster
than it cooks.

36:42.797 --> 36:45.899
The first ticket
was dragging hard.

36:45.900 --> 36:48.335
Hard.

36:48.336 --> 36:51.138
When I was at the pass, Dana
couldn't really get the food up.

36:51.139 --> 36:54.275
It was messing me up.
She was a disaster.

36:54.276 --> 36:55.643
Have you ever worked
a pass before?

36:55.644 --> 36:57.211
Me?
No.

36:57.212 --> 37:01.715
I felt that you had never worked
a pass before.

37:01.716 --> 37:03.884
you.
If Barbie thinks she is going

37:03.885 --> 37:06.520
<i>to win Hell's Kitchen,
she is delusional.</i>

37:06.521 --> 37:08.489
You were very uncomfortable
at the pass.

37:08.490 --> 37:10.391
Um, all right.

37:10.392 --> 37:13.761
I usually disagree with Barbie,

37:13.762 --> 37:16.163
and Dana is one of my best
friends, but she was just kind

37:16.164 --> 37:17.865
of up the entire line.

37:17.866 --> 37:21.502
Dana, I'm sorry.
You know it's never personal.

37:21.503 --> 37:24.138
But I know you had one under cod
when I was up there.

37:24.139 --> 37:26.040
<i>Really, Christina?</i>

37:28.476 --> 37:31.945
They can say what they want,
but I've been on top

37:31.946 --> 37:34.214
in pretty much every challenge.

37:34.215 --> 37:36.250
It's about
the entire competition.

37:36.251 --> 37:37.918
It's not just about tonight.

37:37.919 --> 37:40.521
So I don't deserve to go home.

37:51.466 --> 37:54.401
Tonight, you were dropped
into the deep end big time.

37:54.402 --> 37:57.204
<i>And it was a very important
test for me to see</i>

37:57.205 --> 37:58.706
who's gonna sink,
who's gonna swim,

37:58.707 --> 38:00.140
<i>who can hold their own,</i>

38:00.141 --> 38:01.742
<i>who can crack under pressure,</i>

38:01.743 --> 38:03.577
who can push the brigade.

38:03.578 --> 38:07.848
So I need to hear why should
you stay in Hell's Kitchen.

38:10.685 --> 38:12.419
Barbie.
I haven't given up

38:12.420 --> 38:13.787
since I've gotten here, chef.

38:13.788 --> 38:15.556
I've learned, I've grown,

38:15.557 --> 38:17.858
<i>and I still have my passion.</i>

38:17.859 --> 38:19.126
I still have my inspiration

38:19.127 --> 38:20.427
<i>and my motivation.</i>

38:20.428 --> 38:22.396
I don't want
to go home tonight.

38:22.397 --> 38:23.564
Justin.

38:23.565 --> 38:24.965
I drive every single day.

38:24.966 --> 38:26.100
I give 150%.

38:26.101 --> 38:27.534
The biggest thing I learned

38:27.535 --> 38:29.103
in this competition
is leave my ego

38:29.104 --> 38:30.003
and know that I know
how to lead a team.

38:30.004 --> 38:30.804
<i>You showed me that.</i>

38:30.805 --> 38:32.239
It's not all about cooking.

38:32.240 --> 38:33.640
It's about leading,
and I know

38:33.641 --> 38:36.577
I have what it takes to lead
any kind of brigade there is.

38:36.578 --> 38:38.479
Dana.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.381
I've excelled
in the challenges.

38:40.382 --> 38:43.250
I think I've outright won
four or five of them.

38:43.251 --> 38:45.352
And I've been consistent
this entire competition.

38:45.353 --> 38:47.821
<i>I know tonight wasn't
my best performance,</i>

38:47.822 --> 38:49.156
but, when I do make a mistake,

38:49.157 --> 38:50.491
I listen to what you say,

38:50.492 --> 38:51.992
I learn from it,
and I don't make

38:51.993 --> 38:54.528
the same mistakes again.

38:54.529 --> 38:56.930
Thank you.
Christina.

38:56.931 --> 38:58.632
The moment I walked
through those doors

38:58.633 --> 39:00.734
that first day,
I had my mouth shut

39:00.735 --> 39:02.503
and had my eyes and ears open.

39:02.504 --> 39:04.204
As I progressed
throughout this competition,

39:04.205 --> 39:06.039
I found my spot
as the leader on my team.

39:06.040 --> 39:07.941
<i>My standards
are so much higher,</i>

39:07.942 --> 39:10.644
and that's on account of you.

39:11.713 --> 39:13.614
This has been really hard
for me.

39:13.615 --> 39:16.650
<i>And the reason why I'm having
such a hard time</i>

39:16.651 --> 39:19.386
<i>is that the next service
in Hell's Kitchen</i>

39:19.387 --> 39:22.689
is the final.

39:22.690 --> 39:26.126
Tonight, two of you
are going home.

39:28.663 --> 39:32.933
The first person leaving
Hell's Kitchen...

39:32.934 --> 39:35.569
Is...

39:44.213 --> 39:46.515
Chef Ramsay has
just informed the chefs

39:46.516 --> 39:47.849
that the next service

39:47.850 --> 39:49.918
will be the final,
and so tonight

39:49.919 --> 39:51.820
two chefs will be leaving.

39:51.821 --> 39:54.456
The first person
leaving Hell's Kitchen...

39:56.325 --> 39:57.934
Is...

40:00.441 --> 40:02.662
Barbie.

40:04.867 --> 40:07.836
Listen, you've been amazing.

40:07.837 --> 40:10.439
The level of improvement

40:10.440 --> 40:12.040
has been extraordinary.

40:12.041 --> 40:16.478
You are a very gifted,
smart, determined girl.

40:16.479 --> 40:18.880
<i>So you take that...
I will, chef.</i>

40:18.881 --> 40:20.515
<i>And you run with it.
Thank you.</i>

40:20.516 --> 40:22.584
Please give me your jacket.

40:22.585 --> 40:23.952
Thank you.
You're welcome.

40:23.953 --> 40:25.754
Thank you, chef.

40:25.755 --> 40:27.489
Bye, guys.
See you, Barbie.

40:27.490 --> 40:29.057
Good luck, Barbie.

40:33.729 --> 40:35.697
I really did want to win,

40:35.698 --> 40:37.866
<i>but, you know,
Hell's Kitchen is not easy.</i>

40:37.867 --> 40:40.602
And, at the very beginning,
everyone was trying

40:40.603 --> 40:43.505
to get rid of me.
You want to get choked out?

40:43.506 --> 40:45.106
<i>You want to get
choked out, you dumb ?</i>

40:45.107 --> 40:46.408
Yeah, .

40:46.409 --> 40:48.210
You ain't never jogged
a day in your life.

40:48.211 --> 40:49.511
And your ass shows it.

40:49.512 --> 40:51.513
Ooh, I want to hit you so bad,

40:51.514 --> 40:53.248
<i>you nasty bitch.</i>

40:53.249 --> 40:54.683
But I didn't let that stop me.

40:54.684 --> 40:56.017
Ladies, congratulations.

40:57.220 --> 40:59.721
I just put up
three perfect scallops,

40:59.722 --> 41:01.056
and we won.

41:01.057 --> 41:02.157
It wasn't easy.

41:02.158 --> 41:03.658
Who cooked them?
I did, chef.

41:03.659 --> 41:05.327
You did?
Yes, chef.

41:05.328 --> 41:06.661
For the firefighters
of this country.

41:06.662 --> 41:07.662
Get out!

41:07.663 --> 41:09.998
But I got a black jacket.

41:09.999 --> 41:12.968
And got all the way

41:12.969 --> 41:14.636
to the top four.
Tastes like celeriac.

41:14.637 --> 41:16.004
Well spotted. Let's go.
Okay.

41:16.005 --> 41:19.441
So I definitely feel
like I proved some people wrong.

41:19.442 --> 41:21.009
I'm really proud of myself.

41:21.010 --> 41:22.544
I'm not gonna be bummed
about it at all.

41:22.545 --> 41:24.012
I had a blast while I was here.

41:24.013 --> 41:26.948
<i>When I look
at the three of you,</i>

41:26.949 --> 41:28.850
this is where it gets
really hard.

41:28.851 --> 41:30.218
<i>Really difficult.</i>

41:30.219 --> 41:32.854
<i>Because there's a fraction</i>

41:32.855 --> 41:34.389
separating all three of you.

41:34.390 --> 41:36.625
<i>And, honestly, I could see</i>

41:36.626 --> 41:38.927
<i>all three of you
in the Hell's Kitchen final.</i>

41:41.497 --> 41:43.632
But there can only be two.

41:54.677 --> 41:57.779
The first chef going through

41:57.780 --> 42:00.916
<i>to the Hell's Kitchen final
is...</i>

42:06.455 --> 42:08.957
<i>Next time on Hell's Kitchen,</i>

42:08.958 --> 42:11.159
the finale begins
as the final three...

42:11.160 --> 42:13.895
The first chef going through

42:13.896 --> 42:15.597
<i>to the Hell's Kitchen
final is...</i>

42:15.598 --> 42:17.232
Become the final two.

42:17.233 --> 42:18.600
Who will be competing?

42:18.601 --> 42:20.302
Congratulations to you both.

42:20.303 --> 42:21.536
In one of the most glamorous...

42:21.537 --> 42:22.804
Welcome.

42:22.805 --> 42:24.172
Luxurious...

42:24.173 --> 42:26.775
Your VIP day starts here.

42:26.776 --> 42:28.143
Over-the-top...

42:28.144 --> 42:29.644
What a welcome.
Look at that. Amazing.

42:29.645 --> 42:31.104
<i>Hell's Kitchens yet.</i>

42:31.105 --> 42:33.682
Ladies and gentlemen,
Penn and Teller.

42:33.683 --> 42:34.616
Chef Wolfgang Puck.

42:34.617 --> 42:36.851
♪ Wolfgang Puck

42:36.852 --> 42:38.720
Good to see you.
Thank you.

42:38.721 --> 42:41.156
Everyone will be there.

42:41.157 --> 42:42.591
<i>Welcome back.</i>

42:42.592 --> 42:43.992
Here's my can
of whoop-ass.

42:43.993 --> 42:46.928
Serving it up.
Anybody want some?

42:46.929 --> 42:49.798
Watch out, bitches,
'cause here comes Robyn.

42:49.799 --> 42:52.901
As the time has
come for the final battle,

42:52.902 --> 42:55.904
which will determine who
will become Gordon Ramsay's

42:55.905 --> 42:58.006
new head chef.
