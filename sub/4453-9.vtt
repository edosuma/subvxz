01:48.088 --> 01:49.089
William.

01:57.556 --> 01:59.391
Didn't 'spect
we'd be seeing you again.

02:00.934 --> 02:02.478
Well...

02:04.271 --> 02:05.481
here I be.

02:07.107 --> 02:08.192
Hello, William.

02:10.818 --> 02:12.780
Is Naomi within?

02:13.530 --> 02:15.574
<i>' I</i> 90'! You.

02:24.416 --> 02:25.834
You came back.

02:28.045 --> 02:29.630
The Swede's dead.

02:41.141 --> 02:43.519
Well, I hope you'd stay for supper.

03:31.650 --> 03:33.318
I can't live out here forever.

03:33.444 --> 03:34.862
It's too much work alone.

03:36.196 --> 03:37.196
Dangerous.

03:37.656 --> 03:41.076
Besides, it ain't what
the Heavenly Father wants for us.

03:42.661 --> 03:47.082
Come on now. Have some more
of that chicken. Looks real good.

03:50.586 --> 03:53.797
Father disagreed with the Prophet
on Thor Gundersen.

03:54.256 --> 03:56.800
Got him cast out.
And us with him.

03:58.218 --> 03:59.219
I know.

04:02.514 --> 04:03.954
So, where'd you say you're headed?

04:06.018 --> 04:07.018
I didn't.

04:08.937 --> 04:10.063
That ain't settled.

04:17.029 --> 04:18.654
I got an apple pie in the oven.

04:26.497 --> 04:27.497
Good plates...

04:28.540 --> 04:30.042
Apple pie...

04:32.252 --> 04:34.254
You got the royal treatment,
Mr. Bohannon.

04:35.130 --> 04:37.257
Would you like that last biscuit?

04:38.759 --> 04:40.260
- No, thank you.
- You sure?

04:40.928 --> 04:41.928
Naomi's a fine cook.

04:42.262 --> 04:43.263
- Isaac?
- What?

04:44.056 --> 04:46.058
- You are.
- Thank you for dinner.

04:48.268 --> 04:49.394
I've had enough.

04:49.520 --> 04:52.147
Please. Stay the night.

04:52.272 --> 04:53.357
Of course.

04:54.107 --> 04:55.484
You're welcome to.

04:57.444 --> 04:59.071
I'll sleep in the barn.

05:00.739 --> 05:01.739
William.

05:21.343 --> 05:23.470
Mr. Bohannon...

05:34.147 --> 05:35.357
I'm sorry about supper.

05:37.317 --> 05:41.196
Should've seen it'd be hard on you,
but it's been so long...

05:41.321 --> 05:42.531
She's my wife.

05:45.325 --> 05:46.910
William's my son.

05:47.828 --> 05:51.498
Sickness and health
is what it means to be a husband.

05:55.419 --> 05:56.670
We swore an oath.

05:56.795 --> 05:58.338
You left her to smallpox.

05:58.797 --> 05:59.882
Isaac.

06:00.007 --> 06:02.342
Naomi and I share a faith,
Mr. Bohannon.

06:03.343 --> 06:05.345
You see, we also swore an oath.

06:06.722 --> 06:08.348
After you were long gone.

06:10.058 --> 06:11.351
But the difference is...

06:13.145 --> 06:14.730
I will never ride away from her.

06:16.356 --> 06:18.191
All right.
Let's just get some rest.

06:18.817 --> 06:21.361
We'll talk everything over
in the morning. All right?

06:21.820 --> 06:23.822
All right. Go on. It's...

06:25.449 --> 06:27.534
It's all right.
I'll be right in.

06:32.372 --> 06:33.665
Thank you for saving them.

06:36.043 --> 06:37.377
For dispatching that monster.

06:38.420 --> 06:41.548
The Swede cast a long shadow
over all our lives, Mr. Vinson.

06:43.425 --> 06:45.844
We'll be moving on
in the morning, Mr. Bohannon.

06:48.388 --> 06:49.806
I suggest you do the same.

07:12.829 --> 07:14.581
Welcome home, Mr. Durant.

07:15.082 --> 07:17.334
Home? Laramie? Hardly.

07:18.293 --> 07:19.461
With any luck,

07:20.003 --> 07:23.674
the railroad will be through the entire
godforsaken territory

07:23.799 --> 07:25.425
of Wyoming before long.

07:28.428 --> 07:30.347
Surely you won't miss Laramie.

07:31.223 --> 07:32.432
Nah, that ain't it.

07:33.809 --> 07:34.809
I just...

07:35.435 --> 07:37.312
I don't know, Mr. Durant.

07:37.437 --> 07:40.440
I'm warm, I'm safe.
Got a full belly.

07:41.525 --> 07:43.819
I ought to feel grateful, but...
Ennui.

07:45.112 --> 07:49.491
- On what?
- There's a certain dissatisfaction sets in

07:49.616 --> 07:52.077
when we get what we think we want.

07:53.537 --> 07:55.956
<i>Yeah... Ennui.</i>

07:56.915 --> 07:58.333
I guess that's it.

08:01.962 --> 08:04.256
- How long have they been there?
- Since this morning.

08:05.716 --> 08:07.467
This came in on the train.

08:08.844 --> 08:12.055
Something about Cheyenne
being the new railroad hub?

08:19.146 --> 08:23.191
I am sorry, Mr. Nobles, but there
is nothing I can do for any of you.

08:23.316 --> 08:24.985
You can give us back our money.

08:25.110 --> 08:28.363
I am sure the railroad'd be willing
to buy back your land at the current value.

08:28.488 --> 08:30.991
Current value's jack shit
now that Cheyenne's the hub.

08:32.116 --> 08:33.577
The only reason we bought in so high

08:33.702 --> 08:36.246
is 'cause you told us
Laramie was gonna be the hub.

08:36.371 --> 08:38.498
Because that's what I told her.

08:39.916 --> 08:42.501
It's what I believed at the time.

08:43.128 --> 08:48.550
Unfortunately, we are subject to the whims
of the executives in New York.

08:48.675 --> 08:52.387
Now, Mrs. Palmer was taken in,
as we all were.

08:52.512 --> 08:53.889
She's come out a lot nicer.

08:54.514 --> 08:57.392
That fancy Cheyenne hotel of hers
has tripled in value

08:57.517 --> 09:00.854
while the dirt she sold me
ain't fit to raise hogs.

09:00.979 --> 09:06.443
I will personally buy back
all Laramie land deeds

09:06.568 --> 09:10.572
at 10 cents an acre
above the going rate.

09:14.743 --> 09:17.704
Come on, boys.
Smells like horseshit in here.

09:37.557 --> 09:39.810
I never knew you was looking for me.

09:44.731 --> 09:46.399
Started at the fort.

09:48.235 --> 09:49.653
Then Salt Lake City,

09:50.570 --> 09:52.447
where I heard about the smallpox.

09:54.491 --> 09:56.201
Naomi, if I would've known...

09:56.868 --> 09:58.370
That wasn't your fault.

09:59.287 --> 10:00.580
I never sent word.

10:03.166 --> 10:06.253
It only ever felt like I caught
a tiny piece of your heart...

10:07.587 --> 10:10.006
This one dark night
in a lonesome barn...

10:11.591 --> 10:12.592
One night of sin...

10:13.844 --> 10:14.844
Don't say that.

10:15.595 --> 10:17.597
It's why I went with you
to the railroad.

10:18.598 --> 10:20.475
'Cause I'd already
asked so much of you, I...

10:20.600 --> 10:22.519
I couldn't ask you
to stay in that fort.

10:24.437 --> 10:26.773
And Cheyenne
seemed exciting at the time.

10:28.900 --> 10:30.902
Just wasn't the right thing.

10:31.444 --> 10:32.612
Not for William.

10:35.323 --> 10:36.323
I know.

10:39.161 --> 10:40.161
I'm sorry.

10:40.245 --> 10:42.789
No. You don't owe me that.

10:44.249 --> 10:45.625
You never owed me a thing.

10:47.502 --> 10:50.088
That's why I could watch you
ride away from us so easy.

10:52.048 --> 10:53.675
I wished I hadn't.

10:55.844 --> 10:57.095
I quit the Union Pacific...

10:59.472 --> 11:00.849
to look for you and William.

11:02.267 --> 11:06.146
I spent months in the wilderness,

11:06.271 --> 11:08.106
just searching.

11:10.275 --> 11:12.110
I ain't ever stopped
thinking about you.

11:15.488 --> 11:17.490
Naomi. Please.

11:22.329 --> 11:24.080
I was planning a house.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.500
I'm here.

11:30.712 --> 11:31.712
You know...

11:33.673 --> 11:35.592
There was a time
those words from you

11:35.717 --> 11:39.512
was the only thing
on God's earth I wanted to hear.

11:43.099 --> 11:44.851
But that time has passed.

11:50.357 --> 11:52.067
We have Isaac now.

11:58.865 --> 12:00.116
I love him.

12:42.993 --> 12:45.120
You're right to take them
to Salt Lake City.

12:46.371 --> 12:47.372
Prairie ain't safe.

12:48.623 --> 12:50.863
Naomi's worried that Brother Brigham
will turn us away.

12:52.335 --> 12:53.670
I could help stoke that engine.

13:00.593 --> 13:01.761
You know the Prophet?

13:02.137 --> 13:03.137
Yeah.

13:03.763 --> 13:05.265
We ain't exactly fond.

13:06.808 --> 13:10.562
But Thor Gundersen
twisted his son all up.

13:13.189 --> 13:16.484
Figure news of his hangin'

13:17.610 --> 13:19.362
ought to get me a sit-down, at least.

13:25.660 --> 13:28.580
Ute braves are on the move.
Saw 'em myself on the way over.

13:31.249 --> 13:32.834
We'll take our chances alone.

13:47.640 --> 13:49.809
I ride to Truckee straight after,
Mr. Vinson,

13:51.227 --> 13:53.063
but I aim to see them safe.

13:54.272 --> 13:55.648
And I ain't asking.

14:00.487 --> 14:02.322
I suppose a second gun
couldn't hurt.

14:06.659 --> 14:07.827
Back in town, I see.

14:08.286 --> 14:11.664
And thirsty from the trip.
I'll take a bourbon

14:12.707 --> 14:14.876
and a thousand more Irish workers.

14:16.294 --> 14:17.837
Christ, that's half of County Cork.

14:18.254 --> 14:19.547
$20 a man.

14:22.467 --> 14:23.467
Keep your money.

14:24.219 --> 14:25.637
It's the hard paper I want.

14:26.679 --> 14:29.015
Stock in the Union Pacific Railroad.

14:31.559 --> 14:33.728
You're a labor contractor.

14:33.853 --> 14:35.980
Aye. And I'd say I'm undervalued.

14:36.106 --> 14:38.775
No one holds you in higher esteem
than I do, Mickey.

14:38.900 --> 14:40.902
Jesus, I'm touched.

14:44.114 --> 14:45.240
The thing is, though,

14:45.907 --> 14:49.452
I know that you're short
900 Mormon graders.

14:50.370 --> 14:52.288
Brigham Young is a stubborn man.

14:56.126 --> 14:58.795
I don't want it all to be
liquor and whores, Doc.

14:59.879 --> 15:03.258
I'm tired of the Dead Rabbits
and this whole dirty business.

15:04.884 --> 15:07.303
I will make you a partner

15:08.096 --> 15:10.765
in the railroad's construction company.
Crédit Mobilier.

15:10.890 --> 15:12.410
Crédit Mobilier
is a worthless shell.

15:12.517 --> 15:15.186
I want the real thing.
I want legitimacy. I...

15:17.147 --> 15:19.149
Or you can race Cullen Bohannon
with no graders.

15:19.274 --> 15:20.274
Bohannon.

15:21.526 --> 15:23.778
Hardly the adversary I expected.

15:24.362 --> 15:25.362
Well,

15:25.738 --> 15:28.741
it seems like you don't need
my services after all, then.

15:31.119 --> 15:33.830
The bourbon's on the house. Hey.

15:37.417 --> 15:39.627
It's not Sunday or a holiday, Psalms.

15:39.752 --> 15:41.921
Why aren't you in the cut,
building my railroad?

15:42.505 --> 15:44.924
Four long years I been
toiling on your railroad.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.927
Today, I'm busted
as the day I was freed.

15:49.220 --> 15:51.931
I come to sell back my deed
for whatever I can get.

15:53.099 --> 15:55.977
I did caution you not to tangle

15:56.102 --> 15:58.354
in the complicated world
of real estate investment.

15:58.938 --> 16:00.023
You chose...

16:01.649 --> 16:03.526
to disregard my warnings.

16:05.361 --> 16:09.115
However, you... you have been loyal
to the railroad

16:09.240 --> 16:11.201
and I would like
you to have this.

16:11.326 --> 16:14.370
Thirty pieces of silver
don't buy back what you took.

16:17.540 --> 16:19.959
I hope you're not looking
for an apology.

16:20.877 --> 16:24.297
It would be beneath your dignity to ask,
and mine to offer.

16:27.175 --> 16:29.677
I guess I better get back
to the cut, then.

16:43.816 --> 16:45.443
There's pieces in there still.

16:46.694 --> 16:48.238
Yeah. Doctor couldn't get it all.

16:50.406 --> 16:51.486
It won't ever heal, then.

16:53.159 --> 16:54.369
Some things don't.

17:04.087 --> 17:05.922
You should get some sleep.

17:08.007 --> 17:10.009
Yeah. I'll go check on William.

17:12.011 --> 17:13.387
- Good night.
- Yeah.

17:30.029 --> 17:31.406
I met her about a year ago.

17:33.741 --> 17:36.035
Aaron Hatch and his family
stumbled into Salt Lake,

17:37.745 --> 17:39.539
most of them boiling with pox.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.875
My father took in the survivors.

17:45.044 --> 17:46.045
And Naomi...

17:48.631 --> 17:50.049
She was so darn pretty...

17:52.093 --> 17:54.053
I could hardly look at her.

17:55.888 --> 17:57.140
She is a beautiful girl.

18:00.059 --> 18:02.061
There's a sadness in her.

18:03.104 --> 18:04.856
You can see it.

18:05.273 --> 18:08.234
There is a strength there,
and grace.

18:11.654 --> 18:14.782
We been through drought, lnjuns,

18:15.950 --> 18:18.536
plague of grasshoppers...

18:22.665 --> 18:24.876
There was also
William's first steps.

18:26.002 --> 18:27.002
Christmas.

18:28.087 --> 18:29.505
All the apple pie.

18:31.674 --> 18:33.468
And all of it
melts from her eyes...

18:35.762 --> 18:37.180
whenever she looks at you.

18:44.145 --> 18:46.356
I have a right to know
your intentions.

18:50.109 --> 18:51.110
See to Naomi.

19:19.138 --> 19:21.307
You. John. Listen up.

19:22.016 --> 19:24.435
Prepare to translate.
And make haste, for Christ's sake.

19:24.560 --> 19:25.560
I hate it down here.

19:26.145 --> 19:28.147
Attention all jakes.

19:28.564 --> 19:30.942
Bossy man Huntington
back from Utah.

19:31.317 --> 19:35.029
He say, picky uppy pacey.
Double-time, ching-chong.

19:38.157 --> 19:40.076
Longer shifts. No more breaks.

19:40.201 --> 19:42.829
And bonuses for every man
at tunnel's end.

19:50.628 --> 19:54.215
Bohannon? He back? From Utah?

19:55.383 --> 19:57.176
Word is he found his family.

19:58.177 --> 20:02.557
Nope. Don't count on seeing him
down here again, stupid ass.

22:11.519 --> 22:13.396
Too close. We can't run.

22:13.521 --> 22:15.523
- Well, we'll fight.
- Ain't a fight they want.

22:15.648 --> 22:17.328
They're all busted up,
and they're on foot.

22:19.235 --> 22:21.070
- They want the horses.
- That's right.

22:21.195 --> 22:23.131
- The horses are too valuable.
- Night's in their favor.

22:23.155 --> 22:24.835
Lose the ridin' horses
or lose your scalps.

22:26.158 --> 22:27.158
Do it.

22:44.385 --> 22:45.385
Go!

26:25.564 --> 26:27.733
Cullen Bohannon
to see the Prophet.

26:46.794 --> 26:50.464
The Bible describes an apostate
as a sow that was washed,

26:51.090 --> 26:53.592
then leaves to wallow in the mire.

26:54.635 --> 26:57.179
The Word commands
they be stoned to death.

26:57.596 --> 26:58.889
Ain't no apostates here.

26:59.807 --> 27:00.975
Just good Mormons.

27:01.809 --> 27:02.809
And me.

27:04.687 --> 27:06.272
Sometime Mormons.

27:07.022 --> 27:09.733
Those who have heard the truth,
turned their backs on it

27:09.859 --> 27:11.485
to follow Aaron Hatch.

27:11.610 --> 27:13.404
Aaron Hatch was a good man.

27:14.613 --> 27:15.614
He's dead.

27:16.407 --> 27:18.117
And Thor Gundersen is hanged.

27:19.076 --> 27:22.621
Thor Gundersen spat poison
in my beloved son's ear.

27:23.330 --> 27:24.874
It's good the snake is dead.

27:26.625 --> 27:27.918
Come in, gentile.

27:28.711 --> 27:31.463
For now, these Hatchites

27:32.089 --> 27:34.091
may feed and water
their horses in our stable.

27:34.216 --> 27:37.553
We will discuss
what shall become of them.

27:43.809 --> 27:45.352
They ain't Hatchites.

27:47.563 --> 27:50.524
Just stray sheep in need of their flock.

27:50.649 --> 27:52.902
You've betrayed their shepherd with lies.

27:53.027 --> 27:56.322
The flock will suffer for it.
I no longer bargain with gentiles.

27:56.447 --> 27:57.531
I ain't here to bargain.

27:58.324 --> 28:02.661
Just to speak for a good,
devout Mormon family.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.120
Your family.

28:05.664 --> 28:07.666
Naomi is your wife.
William is your son.

28:08.667 --> 28:10.085
That's why I want what's best.

28:10.544 --> 28:15.132
Family is a cherished gift
from Heavenly Father.

28:16.258 --> 28:18.135
Marriage is a sacred vow.

28:18.761 --> 28:21.263
You would return his gifts?

28:22.348 --> 28:24.850
Some might say
that makes you an apostate.

28:28.270 --> 28:30.940
So long as Naomi and William
ain't the ones who got to pay.

28:32.441 --> 28:37.446
Ambition resides in your heart,
Mr. Bohannon,

28:37.571 --> 28:39.365
fed by the sin of pride.

28:40.074 --> 28:43.077
It's why you choose the railroad
over your own family.

28:44.495 --> 28:45.746
The Bible warns us,

28:46.705 --> 28:51.502
Heavenly Father
saves not by money,

28:52.336 --> 28:53.587
power or vanity.

28:54.546 --> 28:55.923
He saves by love.

28:58.175 --> 28:59.551
I pray you learn this.

29:01.345 --> 29:02.721
For without love...

29:06.350 --> 29:08.310
you will die a lonely,
wretched thing.

29:19.738 --> 29:21.031
And the stray sheep?

29:23.409 --> 29:26.578
Would you deny them
the love of their shepherd?

29:41.760 --> 29:43.429
Isaac's gone to water the horses.

29:44.388 --> 29:46.628
Brigham Young hopes you're in church
on Sunday morning,

29:47.474 --> 29:50.019
front row, so he can bless your marriage.

30:04.783 --> 30:07.369
My father would have wanted me
to keep my vow to you.

30:10.456 --> 30:11.790
This ain't your head talking.

30:12.791 --> 30:14.209
William is your son.

30:16.628 --> 30:18.797
It ain't right for me
to keep him from you.

30:21.800 --> 30:22.968
Pray on it.

30:31.810 --> 30:32.811
I Will.

30:46.241 --> 30:47.451
Throw your backs into it.

30:47.826 --> 30:49.661
Listen here. This is slack work.

30:50.079 --> 30:51.830
Pick it up, else we miss a meal.

30:52.247 --> 30:53.247
Why?

30:55.084 --> 30:57.294
Why we gotta work like mule
for the fat man?

30:57.419 --> 30:58.504
Yeah...

30:59.046 --> 31:01.757
'Cause it's your job,
that's why.

31:02.633 --> 31:06.011
And he break our backs,
steals our money.

31:07.846 --> 31:10.557
This ain't slavery time.
We ain't got to go along now.

31:13.685 --> 31:14.685
You're right.

31:15.854 --> 31:17.314
To hell with the fat man.

31:19.066 --> 31:20.067
We don't work for him.

31:21.026 --> 31:22.236
We work for ourselves.

31:23.654 --> 31:25.531
I was tricked by the devil,
that's true.

31:26.865 --> 31:28.700
Was tempted by easy money.

31:29.535 --> 31:30.869
But freedom ain't easy.

31:31.870 --> 31:34.039
So next time, we wait.
We wait and see.

31:34.873 --> 31:37.167
We ain't got no money left for next time.

31:37.292 --> 31:39.169
That's why we need our jobs, fool.

31:39.294 --> 31:42.381
So we can save up.
Can't let the devil beat us.

31:42.881 --> 31:44.550
We'll just see
what the Lord got in store.

31:46.885 --> 31:48.262
I'm done waiting on the Lord.

31:52.141 --> 31:56.103
What else you got?
No bread. Nowhere to go.

31:56.895 --> 31:58.897
No 40 acres and no mule.

31:59.565 --> 32:02.568
All you got is this job.

32:04.778 --> 32:05.904
It's all you got.

32:08.157 --> 32:09.908
Now you pick up
them damn shovels.

32:10.284 --> 32:11.326
And you work.

32:29.928 --> 32:33.390
McGinnes is our only connection
to the labor market in the northeast.

32:34.766 --> 32:38.312
More Freedmen, then. Buy out the
bonds from the southern prisons.

32:38.437 --> 32:40.939
We haven't kept up payment
on the Freedmen's bonds we have.

32:42.149 --> 32:44.109
The prisons have refused
further business with us.

32:44.943 --> 32:45.944
Thank you, Mr. Delaney.

32:50.991 --> 32:53.535
This is what comes of nepotism.

32:55.204 --> 33:00.918
The useless son-in-law
of my bloated former partner.

33:01.043 --> 33:02.753
Well, what does he do all day?

33:03.212 --> 33:05.339
Tap a ball of string around...

33:09.801 --> 33:12.429
You need McGinnes if you want
the coal fields in Ogden.

33:15.224 --> 33:20.687
Our schemes have left us with no friends,
New York, no allies.

33:21.980 --> 33:23.815
You need Mickey.

33:29.488 --> 33:30.989
I'm right and you know it.

33:34.159 --> 33:36.995
Four hundred shares
in Union Pacific Railroad.

33:38.622 --> 33:41.333
Enough to buy you
out of the vice business

33:41.458 --> 33:43.794
and set you on the road to legitimacy.

33:45.003 --> 33:46.088
Me mother'd be proud.

33:48.674 --> 33:51.426
It's not all steaks and French wine.

33:52.219 --> 33:54.429
Ownership comes with responsibilities.

33:55.013 --> 33:56.493
And what kinds of responsibilities?

33:57.015 --> 33:59.601
Responsibilities suited
to a man of your background.

34:00.394 --> 34:03.021
A man unafraid of back alleys.

34:04.231 --> 34:06.900
This is supposed to keep me
from them kinds of responsibilities.

34:07.025 --> 34:08.735
It's not just the Dead Rabbits.

34:09.610 --> 34:11.071
Every business is dirty.

34:15.033 --> 34:16.243
Give me the stock.

34:18.661 --> 34:21.956
I'll have your thousand workers out to you
by the end of the week.

34:33.510 --> 34:34.678
You kept your word.

34:37.472 --> 34:39.850
Thank you.
I ain't done it for you.

34:46.898 --> 34:48.233
I know who you done it for.

35:11.089 --> 35:12.299
You're leaving.

35:25.896 --> 35:26.896
Isaac“.

35:29.399 --> 35:30.609
Is a good man.

35:34.738 --> 35:35.947
Is this is the right thing?

35:40.786 --> 35:42.037
It's the only thing.

35:51.338 --> 35:52.338
William.

35:55.133 --> 35:57.511
I was going to say this
to you when you got older,

36:00.138 --> 36:02.599
but I best tell it to you now.

36:06.728 --> 36:07.729
I hope you strive...

36:11.149 --> 36:12.150
your whole life...

36:13.777 --> 36:15.028
to be humble.

36:20.575 --> 36:21.743
You respect women.

36:23.745 --> 36:25.789
You take your hat
off at the table.

36:28.166 --> 36:30.836
Don't... don't never start a fight

36:31.962 --> 36:33.255
nor run from one neither.

36:35.382 --> 36:38.176
Forgive. Forget.

36:40.804 --> 36:42.055
Speak true.

36:48.186 --> 36:50.188
Listen to your mama
and your daddy.

37:01.074 --> 37:04.578
I hope you find love, Cullen Bohannon.

37:06.830 --> 37:08.206
You deserve that.

37:57.923 --> 38:01.301
Watch out! Watch out!

40:40.418 --> 40:41.795
I thought you no come back.

40:44.881 --> 40:47.425
Yeah, I thought so myself for a second.

40:51.137 --> 40:52.430
But that's all done now.
