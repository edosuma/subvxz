"We," <i>mon cher?</i>

30:09.226 --> 30:10.978
I believe I already did.

30:11.061 --> 30:14.398
I thought I'd hired me
a professional witch hunter.

30:14.481 --> 30:16.441
Coming here in the light of day.

30:17.109 --> 30:19.194
"We got a problem."

30:19.278 --> 30:21.113
I got a problem. You.

30:21.196 --> 30:23.615
Six years in that house
and for what?

30:23.699 --> 30:26.118
Access. You know that.
You said you wanted more

30:26.201 --> 30:27.619
than just the witches at the academy.

30:27.703 --> 30:29.872
You said you wanted
all the Salem descendants.

30:29.955 --> 30:31.748
That's what I've been giving you.

30:31.832 --> 30:34.835
I'm really glad you decided
to come and see us, Kaylee.

30:34.918 --> 30:37.337
Well, to be honest,
I mostly wanted to see Bourbon Street

30:37.421 --> 30:40.674
-and eat at Emeril's restaurant.
-Mmm-hmm.

30:40.757 --> 30:42.384
This other stuff?

30:42.467 --> 30:43.719
I don't know.

30:45.095 --> 30:47.556
This place?
I'm not really sure it's for me.

30:47.639 --> 30:49.099
This isn't a nunnery.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.101
It's not a jail.

30:51.476 --> 30:52.686
It's a haven

30:52.769 --> 30:55.189
where you can learn
about who and what you are.

30:55.856 --> 30:57.149
What do you think I am?

30:57.232 --> 30:58.734
I don't think you're an arsonist.

30:58.817 --> 31:00.944
Which is what you've been charged with.

31:01.028 --> 31:02.112
Twice.

31:02.196 --> 31:04.239
-But not convicted.
-Not yet.

31:05.532 --> 31:07.868
Why don't you tell me
about the last fire?

31:08.410 --> 31:10.204
KAYLEE: <i>You said that you loved me.</i>

31:10.287 --> 31:11.580
I changed my mind.

31:11.663 --> 31:13.498
I can't marry you. I'm sorry.

31:13.582 --> 31:15.250
(CRYING) But why?

31:15.334 --> 31:17.544
Will you just give me
one goddamn reason?

31:17.628 --> 31:20.339
There's something
not right about you, okay?

31:20.422 --> 31:22.049
You make my friends squirm.

31:22.132 --> 31:24.468
My mother says if I married you
I would regret it

31:24.551 --> 31:26.011
as long as I live, okay?

31:26.094 --> 31:27.137
And I think she's right.

31:27.221 --> 31:28.931
I'm sorry, Kaylee.

31:32.392 --> 31:34.728
(SCREAMING)

31:41.818 --> 31:43.904
I don't really like to talk about this.

31:43.987 --> 31:45.447
You have genuine power.

31:45.531 --> 31:47.824
Nothing to be ashamed of,
but it is something

31:47.908 --> 31:49.451
you need to learn how to control.

31:49.535 --> 31:52.913
Wouldn't you like to be surrounded
by people with similar gifts?

31:56.333 --> 32:00.045
Truth be told, Mrs. Foxx, I…
I really don't want to be powerful.

32:00.504 --> 32:05.008
I just want to find a good husband
and have three kids.

32:05.092 --> 32:07.135
I think I have a really good shot.

32:07.219 --> 32:09.096
I work out, and I play Fantasy Football.

32:09.179 --> 32:11.265
Nine Salem descendants
in just three years.

32:11.723 --> 32:14.101
Five of them I never would have found
without Delia's research.

32:14.184 --> 32:16.728
Maybe we should take you
off the payroll and put her on it.

32:16.812 --> 32:18.897
Sounds like she doing all the work.

32:18.981 --> 32:20.983
-This is what we agreed to!
-No.

32:21.066 --> 32:23.986
What we agreed to is
that you would clean house,

32:24.069 --> 32:25.445
not play house.

32:25.529 --> 32:27.906
-What's that supposed to mean?
-What you think it means?

32:27.990 --> 32:29.741
She made you hard.

32:29.825 --> 32:31.785
You went soft!

32:31.869 --> 32:35.414
You're in love with that sorry witch.

32:35.497 --> 32:38.000
-(SCOFFS) Bullshit.
-Bullshit is right.

32:38.083 --> 32:40.002
You're supposed to be
ridding me of my enemies.

32:40.085 --> 32:41.670
Instead, they're mouthier than ever!

32:41.753 --> 32:44.590
Showing up on my doorstep,
disrespecting me,

32:44.673 --> 32:45.799
digging up my enemies.

32:45.883 --> 32:48.969
When I plant
a fat-assed cracker bitch,

32:49.052 --> 32:50.804
I expect her to stay planted,

32:50.888 --> 32:53.223
not come back up
like goddamned ragweed!

32:53.307 --> 32:55.893
And that Fiona,
doing my Bastien like that.

32:55.976 --> 32:57.352
Bastien.

32:58.228 --> 32:59.396
My poor Bastien.

32:59.479 --> 33:00.898
They desecrated you.

33:02.608 --> 33:06.445
And I brought you back life,
and she took it away again?

33:07.863 --> 33:10.532
Well, now we take hers and all.

33:11.533 --> 33:12.534
No more nonsense.

33:12.618 --> 33:15.037
You go back there,
and you bring me their heads.

33:15.120 --> 33:16.455
All of them.

33:16.538 --> 33:17.539
What?

33:17.623 --> 33:18.999
Fiona,

33:19.082 --> 33:22.961
her daughter
and every witch bitch in that house.

33:23.462 --> 33:25.881
You bring me their heads,
all of them.

33:25.964 --> 33:28.217
Then you burn that place
to the ground.

33:28.300 --> 33:29.718
Uh, Marie…

33:29.801 --> 33:32.387
You do it, and you do it quick.

33:32.846 --> 33:34.890
And I let you live.

33:38.393 --> 33:40.229
QUEENIE: I know you went all Malcolm X
and shit,

33:40.312 --> 33:42.564
but this house is now a carnival of crazy.

33:43.607 --> 33:45.651
How are you gonna
explain this to Fiona?

33:45.734 --> 33:46.902
I'm not.

33:46.985 --> 33:48.904
No one says a word to Fiona.

33:49.446 --> 33:52.199
We have to keep Madison
under the radar until she's better.

33:52.699 --> 33:54.701
And I'll… I'll figure out
what to do with Kyle.

33:54.785 --> 33:58.080
I'm not taking him.
He's a walking tornado.

33:59.289 --> 34:00.624
You made him.

34:01.542 --> 34:03.210
He's your problem now.

34:05.754 --> 34:08.674
Okay. Who's taking me home?

34:08.757 --> 34:12.427
It's late. Why don't you stay the night,
sleep in a real bed for a change?

34:12.511 --> 34:13.762
No, thanks.

34:14.054 --> 34:15.222
I need to be alone.

34:15.305 --> 34:16.807
I thought you were
looking for your tribe.

34:16.890 --> 34:21.228
I was… and I am.

34:22.354 --> 34:23.397
This ain't it.

34:24.064 --> 34:25.399
I got bad vibes.

34:25.983 --> 34:27.276
Real bad.

34:27.776 --> 34:29.653
There's something foul
in this house.

34:35.367 --> 34:36.660
(LOCK CLICKS)

35:30.589 --> 35:32.424

I'm-I'm Madison Montgomery.

36:13.257 --> 36:15.217
I make $7 million a picture.

36:15.801 --> 36:17.845
I have two Teen Choice Awards.

36:17.928 --> 36:19.012
You died.

36:20.305 --> 36:21.682
We brought you back.

36:23.308 --> 36:25.102
What's the last thing you remember?

36:29.273 --> 36:30.440
Red.

36:32.901 --> 36:35.320
After that, it's all dark.

36:36.947 --> 36:38.615
Did you see a bright light?

36:39.908 --> 36:40.993
No.

36:42.035 --> 36:43.829
There's nothing on the other side.

36:45.163 --> 36:46.498
It's just black…

36:47.457 --> 36:48.500
Forever.

36:51.378 --> 36:52.379
Who are you?

36:55.090 --> 36:56.383
What do you want?

36:58.677 --> 36:59.678
Release.

36:59.761 --> 37:00.762
I can't do that.

37:08.979 --> 37:10.564
They ended me once

37:11.023 --> 37:12.816
right here in this very room.

37:12.900 --> 37:14.318
And for years after,

37:14.985 --> 37:19.364
the parties and the music
and the dancing raged wild outside

37:19.448 --> 37:22.451
while I sat trapped

37:22.534 --> 37:25.662
inside these four ugly walls.

37:27.497 --> 37:29.082
Now, last night,

37:30.209 --> 37:33.003
this sweet young witch comes along

37:33.712 --> 37:35.422
and offers me my release,

37:35.839 --> 37:38.509
and I said,
"Oh, yes, ma'am, yes, please.

37:38.592 --> 37:39.635
"What do you need?"

37:39.718 --> 37:43.388
She asks her favor, and I provide.

37:43.847 --> 37:45.474
The thing is,

37:45.557 --> 37:47.851
when the time comes
for her to ante up,

37:48.310 --> 37:51.688
bitch lies, leaving me betwixt,

37:51.772 --> 37:53.857
between and ready to pop.

37:54.316 --> 37:55.692
Huh?

37:55.776 --> 37:57.611
-You died.
-Uh-huh.

37:57.694 --> 37:58.946
And now you're trapped.

37:59.029 --> 38:00.447
Right here with you.

38:01.532 --> 38:04.409
The only way I can help you
is if you let me out of here.

38:04.493 --> 38:07.871
No. Nobody leaves this room.

38:09.706 --> 38:11.583
You see, I had a contract.

38:12.626 --> 38:14.586
Promises were made,

38:14.670 --> 38:18.465
and all you've got to
do is sing and dance…

38:20.092 --> 38:22.803
…and call the witches
who owe me my freedom.

38:22.886 --> 38:24.263
