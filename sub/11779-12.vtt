LAST EPISODE OF <i> INK MASTER,</i>

00:04.337 --> 00:06.673
FIVE ARTISTS WERE LEFT
IN THE COMPETITION.

00:06.756 --> 00:08.383
- WE'RE GETTING DOWN
TO SMALL NUMBERS NOW.

00:08.466 --> 00:10.176
EVERYONE'S GOT TO PUT
THEIR TATTOO

00:10.260 --> 00:11.386

IN THE FLASH CHALLENGE,

00:13.012 --> 00:15.765
THE BATTLE FOR A SPOT
IN THE TOP FOUR WAS ON.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.475
- I'M GONNA [bleep]
NAIL SCOTT.

00:17.559 --> 00:20.437
- THE WINNER IS HALO.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.521
- HALO WINS?

00:21.604 --> 00:22.939
BULL[bleep].

00:23.022 --> 00:24.607
- I'LL DEFINITELY BE GUNNING
FOR YOU.

00:24.691 --> 00:25.442
IT'S A MEXICAN GUN FIGHT.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.026
IT'S TIME TO GO TOE-TO-TOE.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.528
- BRING IT.

00:28.611 --> 00:30.321
- TODAY, YOU MUST ALL TATTOO
A JAPANESE SNAKE.

00:30.405 --> 00:33.783
- I HOPE THIS IS THE ONE
THAT KNOCKS SCOTT ON HIS ASS.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.160
- YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME.

00:35.243 --> 00:36.745
narrator: IN THE ELIMINATION
TATTOO...

00:36.828 --> 00:38.371
- I DON'T WANT IT TOO CONFUSING.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.122
- JUST LEAVE IT.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.165
MY CANVAS IS SO DIFFICULT.

00:40.248 --> 00:42.959
narrator:
SCOTT STRUGGLED TO SURVIVE.

00:43.042 --> 00:44.836
- CAN'T MOVE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A LINE LIKE THAT, OKAY?

00:44.919 --> 00:46.755
I'M STRESSING THE [bleep]
OUT RIGHT NOW.

00:46.838 --> 00:49.215
- FINALLY, SCOTT GETS A TASTE
OF HIS OWN MEDICINE.

00:49.299 --> 00:50.091
- YOU THREW ME A DOOZY, DUDE.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.718
- DOESN'T FEEL GOOD, DOES IT?

00:51.801 --> 00:53.136
- BUT I TURNED IT AROUND.

00:53.219 --> 00:54.471
- [farting noise]

00:54.554 --> 00:55.513
YOURS IS JUST WEIRD.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.223
- BULL[bleep].

00:57.307 --> 00:58.308
IT'S A [bleep] DAMN GOOD TATTOO,

00:58.391 --> 00:59.309
AND THAT'S THAT.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.810
narrator: IN THE ELIMINATION,

01:00.894 --> 01:04.147
HALO, SCOTT, AND MELISSA
WERE THE BOTTOM THREE.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.272
- HALO.

01:05.355 --> 01:06.483
- THE SNAKE BODY
MAKES ZERO SENSE.

01:06.566 --> 01:07.817
IT'S JUST WAY OFF.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.152
WAY OFF.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.069
- SCOTT.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.070
- IT'S INSULTING.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.363
IT'S UTTERLY INCORRECT.

01:12.447 --> 01:13.239
- THIS WOULD BE, LIKE,
MY FIRST HICCUP.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.492
- IT'S DEFINITELY THE BOTTOM.

01:15.575 --> 01:16.701
- MELISSA.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.077
- IF YOU LOOK AT
YOUR APPLICATION

01:18.161 --> 01:19.829
VERSUS SCOTT, HALO, OR MATTI,

01:19.913 --> 01:22.332
TECHNICALLY WE FIND THE DIVIDE.

01:22.415 --> 01:25.668
- MELISSA, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE INK MASTER.

01:27.587 --> 01:28.963
narrator: FOUR ARTISTS REMAIN,

01:29.047 --> 01:33.718

03:09.105 --> 03:10.940
BECAUSE HALO'S
KIND OF WISHY-WASHY.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.109

MORE CONSISTENT.

OF TRIPPING 'EM UP

03:16.112 --> 03:17.447

MEANINGFUL TATTOOS

CELEBRATE A PERSONAL VICTORY.

04:34.023 --> 04:37.360
ONE OF THE GREATEST TRIUMPHS
IS SURVIVING CANCER.

04:37.443 --> 04:40.321
YOUR CANVASES TODAY
HAVE ALL SURVIVED

04:40.405 --> 04:42.073
ONE OF THE DEADLIEST FORMS:

04:42.156 --> 04:43.366
BREAST CANCER.

04:43.449 --> 04:44.867
MANY OF THEM BEAT CANCER

04:44.951 --> 04:47.370
BY HAVING A MASTECTOMY
TO REMOVE THE BREAST.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.038
SOME WOMEN CHOOSE TO RECONSTRUCT
THEIR BREASTS,

04:49.122 --> 04:51.374
BUT THE SCARS REMAIN,

04:51.457 --> 04:54.502
AND THESE SCARS ARE IN
A VERY SENSITIVE AREA,

04:54.585 --> 04:58.172
SO IT'S EVEN MORE CHALLENGING
TO PULL OF A FLAWLESS TATTOO.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.967
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU MUST
YOU DO TO THESE CANVASES.

05:01.050 --> 05:03.761
- AS A CANCER SURVIVOR,

05:03.845 --> 05:06.764
{\an8}I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO STARE DEATH IN THE FACE.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.516
THIS TATTOO REPRESENTS LIFE,

05:08.599 --> 05:10.518
AND IT REPRESENTS
THE GOOD THINGS

05:10.601 --> 05:12.395
THAT COME OUT OF FIGHTING.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.022
- IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE BIGGEST TATTOO.

05:14.105 --> 05:15.565
THE BIGGEST TATTOO
IS NOT GONNA WIN.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.775
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY
PERSONAL TO THESE LADIES

05:17.859 --> 05:19.402
IN A DELICATE AREA.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.904
- THIS IS REALLY A BIG PART
OF DOING WHAT WE DO,

05:21.988 --> 05:23.322
IS WORKING WITH OUR CANVASES.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.365
IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.700
IT'S ABOUT THEM.

05:25.783 --> 05:28.244
WE CARE THAT YOU GIVE THEM
WHAT THEY WANT.

05:28.327 --> 05:29.662

05:31.497 --> 05:33.958
{\an8}- TODAY WE HAVE TO DO
THE MOST IMPORTANT TATTOO

05:34.042 --> 05:36.836
{\an8}THAT WE'VE EVER HAD TO DO.

05:36.919 --> 05:39.338
IT'S ONE OF THE ONLY TATTOOS
YOU CAN GIVE SOMEBODY

05:39.422 --> 05:41.841
THAT ACTUALLY HELPS CHANGE
THEIR LIFE.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.468
- BECAUSE THERE'S NO
FLASH CHALLENGE,

05:43.551 --> 05:45.928
THE HUMAN CANVASES
WILL BE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.056
CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,

05:48.139 --> 05:52.894
PLEASE CHOOSE A SKULL
TO DETERMINE YOUR ARTIST.

05:52.977 --> 05:55.146
- SCOTT.

05:55.229 --> 05:56.606
- SAUSAGE?

05:56.689 --> 05:58.983
- HALO.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.693
- MATTI?

06:00.777 --> 06:03.654
- YOU HAVE THE REST OF THE NIGHT
TO CONSULT WITH YOUR CANVASES.

06:03.738 --> 06:06.032
TOMORROW, YOU'LL HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TATTOO.

06:06.115 --> 06:07.450
BASED ON YOUR WORK,

06:07.533 --> 06:11.454
ONE OF YOU WILL BE
PACKING YOUR MACHINES.

06:11.537 --> 06:11.954
GOOD LUCK.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.290
- ALL RIGHT.

06:14.373 --> 06:15.375
- THESE CANVASES
ARE LOOKING FOR GREAT WORK

06:15.458 --> 06:17.001
OUT OF THESE FINAL FOUR ARTISTS,

06:17.085 --> 06:18.294
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
HOPING FOR AS WELL,

06:18.377 --> 06:20.171
{\an8}AND THIS IS A WAY
TO NOT ONLY COMMEMORATE

06:20.254 --> 06:22.006
{\an8}WHAT THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH,
BUT TO BEAUTIFY IT.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.800
THESE GUYS NEED TO
REALLY STEP UP

06:23.883 --> 06:25.551
AND GIVE THEM EVERYTHING
THEY CAN.

06:25.635 --> 06:29.180
- MY IDEA WAS A DANDELION
ON THE SIDE BLOWING ACROSS,

06:29.263 --> 06:31.307
TRANSFORMING INTO BUTTERFLIES.

06:31.390 --> 06:33.101
{\an8}I HOPE THAT GETTING THIS TATTOO

06:33.184 --> 06:36.312
{\an8}IS REALLY GOING TO MAKE ME FEEL
LIKE I HAVE MY LIFE BACK.

06:36.395 --> 06:39.565
{\an8}CANCER DOESN'T OWN ME.

06:39.649 --> 06:40.358
- I KNOW.
I KNOW IT'S VERY SCARY.

06:40.441 --> 06:42.485
YOU JUST PUT YOUR FAITH IN ME.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.028
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU
A BEAUTIFUL TATTOO.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.655
IT'S GONNA BE A BREEZE.

06:45.738 --> 06:46.656
- LIKE I SAY,
WE'RE WORKING RIGHT IN HERE.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.116
YOUR SCAR,
YOU WON'T EVEN SEE IT.

06:48.199 --> 06:50.827
- OKAY, SOUNDS GREAT.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.496
- I WANTED TO GET A CROSS
ON THE ONE SIDE,

06:53.579 --> 06:55.456
'CAUSE MY MOM DIED
FROM BREAST CANCER,

06:55.540 --> 06:57.667
AND THEN FLOWERS
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.794
- I WANT A FLOWERING VINE...

06:59.877 --> 07:01.671
- RIGHT.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.172
- ACROSS THE WHOLE CHEST.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.674
- ARE YOU TRYING TO GO
WHERE THE NIPPLES

07:04.757 --> 07:05.716
WOULD TEND TO BE, OR--

07:05.800 --> 07:07.051
{\an8}- YES. YES.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.344
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE A WAR WENT ON
IN MY CHEST.

07:08.427 --> 07:09.804
THIS IS LIKE A BATTLEFIELD,

07:09.887 --> 07:12.431
AND I WOULD RATHER HAVE
SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL.

07:12.515 --> 07:13.474
- JUST STAND STRAIGHT,
SHOULDERS AND EVERYTHING.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.977
{\an8}LORI'S SCARS
ARE NOT SYMMETRICAL.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.770
{\an8}THIS ONE,
YOU'RE REALLY, REALLY ROUND.

07:17.854 --> 07:18.980
YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT CONCAVE
ON THIS ONE.

07:19.063 --> 07:21.232
SO I HAVE TO TAKE
A DIFFERENT PLAN OF ACTION.

07:21.315 --> 07:22.733
WHAT I'M GONNA TRY TO DO
IS JUST MAKE SURE

07:22.817 --> 07:26.195
THAT WHATEVER WE PLACE OVER HERE
LAYS EVENLY.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.156
THERE IS NOT GONNA BE A
SYMMETRY BETWEEN THE TWO PIECES.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.115
IT'S A RISK.

07:29.198 --> 07:31.159
I COULD BE IN TROUBLE.

07:37.748 --> 07:41.210
- YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO FINISH YOUR TATTOOS.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.171
YOUR SPOT IN THE LIVE FINALE
IS ON THE LINE,

07:43.254 --> 07:47.842
AND YOUR TIME BEGINS NOW.

07:47.925 --> 07:49.635
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S DO IT.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.429
{\an8}- THIS IS THESE ARTISTS' CHANCE
TO PROVE TO US

07:51.512 --> 07:52.805
{\an8}THAT THEY HAVE
EVERY ESSENTIAL SKILL.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.600
WHICH THREE PEOPLE ARE GONNA GO
TO THE LIVE FINALE,

07:55.683 --> 07:58.102
AND WHICH ONE IS GONNA GO HOME?

07:58.186 --> 07:58.853
GAME ON.

07:58.936 --> 08:00.771
- SO THIS IS THE ONE SIDE

08:00.855 --> 08:02.565
THAT I'VE GOT MAPPED OUT
FOR YOU.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.151
I KNOW THAT I ONLY HAVE
TIME ENOUGH TO DO ONE SIDE.

08:05.234 --> 08:07.528
{\an8}NOW'S NOT THE TIME TO BITE OFF
MORE THAN YOU CAN CHEW.

08:07.612 --> 08:08.779
SINCE WE ONLY HAVE SIX HOURS

08:08.863 --> 08:10.573
AND THIS IS KIND OF
A LARGE TATTOO,

08:10.656 --> 08:12.783
MAYBE JUST CONCENTRATE
ON ONE SIDE?

08:12.867 --> 08:14.410
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

08:14.493 --> 08:16.704
THAT THIS ONE COMES OUT
THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO.

08:16.787 --> 08:18.623
- IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S GONNA BE BEAUTIFUL.

08:18.706 --> 08:22.084
- THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ERROR
WHATSOEVER IN THE TATTOO TODAY.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.503
- WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO
TO MAKE IT LOOK GOOD.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.422
- TO FALL SHORT AT FOURTH PLACE

08:26.505 --> 08:27.548
WOULD JUST BE
A DEVASTATING LOSS FOR ME.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.222
- AFTER LAST NIGHT, I WAS, LIKE,
FEELING REALLY OVERWHELMED

08:35.306 --> 08:36.390
AND STARTED TO FREAK OUT.

08:36.474 --> 08:40.602
I FEEL LIKE I'M JUST NOT READY.

08:40.686 --> 08:43.563
- OUT OF ALL THE TIMES TO HAVE
A CANVAS HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS,

08:43.648 --> 08:45.650
THIS IS THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.485
THERE ARE FOUR
STRONG ARTISTS LEFT.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.237
I DO NOT WANT TO GET SENT HOME

08:49.320 --> 08:51.447
BECAUSE EVERYBODY ELSE DID
A TATTOO, AND I DIDN'T.

08:51.530 --> 08:53.699
- I DON'T WANT TO
WAKE UP TOMORROW AND SAY,

08:53.783 --> 08:56.118
"MAN, WHY DID
I DO ALL THAT?"

08:56.202 --> 08:57.370
- I AM FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW.

08:57.453 --> 08:58.955
- WHAT I DID IS, I DREW

08:59.038 --> 09:00.331
PRETTY MUCH, LIKE, LINE DRAWINGS

09:00.414 --> 09:01.958
OF A BUNCH OF
DIFFERENT BUTTERFLIES.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.709
- WOULD YOU BE OPPOSED TO
NOT DOING THE REALLY BIG ONE?

09:03.793 --> 09:07.296
I REALLY JUST WANT TO KEEP IT
NOT A LOT GOING ON.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.965
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF IT'S A HUGE TATTOO

09:09.048 --> 09:10.716
OR IF IT'S A TINY TATTOO.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.594
THE PRECISION THAT I CAN GET
IN A TINY TATTOO

09:13.678 --> 09:15.638
IS JUST AS NICE.

09:19.058 --> 09:21.560
- STILL OKAY?
- YUP.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.980
{\an8}OH, MY GOSH, I'M GONNA BE
SITTING FOR SIX HOURS.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.606
NO, I DID CHEMO.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.525
I CAN DO THIS.

09:27.608 --> 09:28.943
- I'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK

09:29.026 --> 09:30.528
AND A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME
TO DO IT.

09:30.611 --> 09:33.364
{\an8}I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO WIGGLE ROOM IN THIS.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.157
IT'S NICE THAT THERE ARE
SURVIVORS LIKE YOU

09:35.241 --> 09:36.200
THAT CAN OUT AND GO, LIKE,

09:36.284 --> 09:38.119
"LOOK, IT'S NOT
THE END OF THE WORLD."

09:38.202 --> 09:39.954
TO HAVE THAT POSITIVE SPIN,
I THINK, IS REALLY, REALLY COOL.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.502
- ALL RIGHT,
SO GO AHEAD AND TAKE A LOOK.

09:48.587 --> 09:50.047
- HMM.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.132
I DON'T KNOW,
DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOOD?

09:51.215 --> 09:52.216
- I DO.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.843
I MEAN, LET ME TAKE
A BETTER LOOK AT IT.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.553
{\an8}THIS IS NOT GOING WELL.

09:55.636 --> 09:58.180
I AM RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.974
- FOUR HOURS LEFT, EVERYBODY.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.353
{\an8}- THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE
IS GOING TO BE

10:04.437 --> 10:06.689
{\an8}TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE GETS
EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTS

10:06.772 --> 10:07.648
{\an8}AND THAT SHE FEELS BEAUTIFUL.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.026
LAST CHALLENGE,
I WAS IN THE BOTTOM,

10:10.109 --> 10:11.360
AND I JUST SQUEAKED BY.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.363
I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO DO
A PERFECT TATTOO

10:14.447 --> 10:15.489
SO I CAN MAKE IT
TO THE FINAL THREE.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.450
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HOW WELL YOU'RE SITTING.

10:17.533 --> 10:20.036
THANK YOU AGAIN.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.203
- I DEFINITELY LIKE THIS.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.372
- OKAY, YOU LIKE THE FLOW,
BUT JUST TOO MANY?

10:23.456 --> 10:25.374
- YEAH, BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO MAKE IT MORE SPARSE.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.418
- I JUST NEED TO DO
A TATTOO TODAY.

10:27.501 --> 10:29.086
I THINK IT'S REALLY GOOD.

10:29.170 --> 10:32.089
I THINK WE CAN COMMIT TO THAT
AS LONG AS YOU FEEL IT.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.090
- YEAH, I'M GOOD.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.258
- I HAVE TO WIN THIS.

10:34.342 --> 10:36.260
I'M GONNA MAKE SURE
THAT ALL THE SKILLS

10:36.344 --> 10:37.219
THE JUDGES
ARE LOOKING FOR TODAY,

10:37.303 --> 10:41.724
THEY CAN SEE
WITHIN THIS TATTOO.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.602
NO ONE IS TAKING THAT SPOT
IN THE LIVE FINALE FROM ME.

10:44.685 --> 10:46.103
- TWO HOURS REMAIN.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.480
TWO MORE HOURS.

11:02.161 --> 11:07.583
{\an8}- FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

11:07.666 --> 11:08.668
THAT'S IT.
TIME'S UP.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.086
MACHINES DOWN.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.755
NO MORE INK.

11:12.838 --> 11:14.256
- I'VE BEEN MORE NITPICKY
WITH THIS

11:14.340 --> 11:15.966
THAN ANY FLOWER
I'VE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.051
- [laughs]

11:21.597 --> 11:23.599
- PRETTY?

11:23.682 --> 11:27.311
YEAH.

11:27.395 --> 11:30.356
YOU OKAY?

11:30.439 --> 11:32.024
- I LOVE THE HIGHLIGHTS.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.360
- IT DEFINITELY COULD BE
ANY ARTIST GOING HOME,

11:34.443 --> 11:37.113
BUT I BELIEVE THAT I EARNED
MY SPOT IN THE FINALE TODAY.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.073
- IT IS PERFECT.

11:39.156 --> 11:40.533
OH, MY GOD.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.952
{\an8}- I'M GONNA BE AT THE FINALE.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.120
{\an8}- I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.788
{\an8}- I THINK SAUSAGE IS GOING HOME.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.289
{\an8}- WHAT AN ASS[bleep].

11:47.373 --> 11:48.958
- THERE'S JUST ONE MORE THING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

11:49.041 --> 11:49.458
- WOW.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.460
- [bleep].

11:56.590 --> 11:58.050
- DID YOU SEE SAUSAGE'S PIECE?

11:58.134 --> 11:59.135
- I SAW A LITTLE BIT OF IT

11:59.218 --> 12:00.177
WHEN HE WAS WORKING ON IT.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.595
- IT'S NOT SYMMETRICAL.

12:01.679 --> 12:02.555
IT LOOKS LIKE
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE,

12:02.638 --> 12:03.889
BUT ONE SIDE'S A LOT BIGGER.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.307
IT JUST MESSED WITH
MY EYES, MAN.

12:05.391 --> 12:06.392
I HAD TO LOOK AT IT, LIKE,
TWICE, LIKE,

12:06.475 --> 12:08.310
"WAIT, IS ONE BIGGER THAN
THE OTHER?"

12:08.394 --> 12:10.062
- WHAT IF THAT'S
WHAT SHE WANTED THOUGH, DUDE?

12:10.146 --> 12:11.397
- IT'S GONNA COME DOWN TO
THAT LITTLE STUFF, BRO,

12:11.480 --> 12:13.899
AND IF SOMEONE'S GOING HOME,
IT COULD BE SAUSAGE.

12:16.861 --> 12:17.278
HEY, BUDDY.

12:17.361 --> 12:19.822
- 'SUP?

12:19.905 --> 12:21.824
- WHO WOULD YOU PLACE ON
THE BOTTOM ON THIS CHALLENGE?

12:21.907 --> 12:22.992
- RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD?

12:23.075 --> 12:24.410
YOU'RE GOING HOME.

12:24.493 --> 12:25.494
- I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE, MAN.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.620
- THEY CAN HIT ON
HOW LITTLE YOU DID.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.873
- I GAVE HER EXACTLY
WHAT SHE WANTED.

12:28.956 --> 12:31.125
- I THINK YOURS IS JUST A LITTLE
OFF, AND IT--

12:31.208 --> 12:34.795
- I SAW IT--WITH YOURS, DID SHE
WANT ONE BIGGER THAN THE OTHER?

12:34.879 --> 12:36.505
BREASTS HAVE TO BE SYMMETRICAL.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.299
TO MAKE ONE TATTOO
A DIFFERENT SIZE THAN THE OTHER,

12:38.382 --> 12:40.384
IT IS BAD PLACEMENT.

12:40.468 --> 12:41.177
- I DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.511
- I THINK SAUSAGE IS GOING HOME.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.138
{\an8}- WHAT AN ASS[bleep].

12:44.221 --> 12:46.765
SCOTT JUST DOESN'T WANT TO
SEE ME IN THE END

12:46.849 --> 12:49.435
AND HE'LL DO EVERYTHING HE CAN
TO UNDERMINE MY ARTWORK.

12:49.518 --> 12:50.519
I--YOU'RE GOING HOME.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.562
THAT'S MY OPINION.

12:51.645 --> 12:54.064
- I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.858
- I REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED
LAST TIME YOU SAID THAT TOO.

12:55.941 --> 12:56.984
- YOU DID GO TO THE BOTTOM.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.068
- I'M GONNA BE AT THE FINALE.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.028
THAT'S THAT.

13:15.794 --> 13:17.171
- THIS WEEK, WE ASKED YOU

13:17.254 --> 13:19.465
TO TRANSFORM BREAST CANCER
SURVIVOR SCARS

13:19.548 --> 13:21.800
INTO TATTOOS
THEY CAN WEAR WITH PRIDE.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.637
A TRIP TO THE LIVE FINALE
IS ON THE LINE.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.055
THREE OF YOU WILL MOVE ON,

13:26.138 --> 13:29.767
AND ONE OF YOU IS GOING HOME.

13:29.850 --> 13:32.645
HOWEVER, IT TAKES MORE
THAN THIS ONE TATTOO

13:32.728 --> 13:33.812
TO EARN YOUR TRIP
TO THE LIVE FINALE.

13:37.525 --> 13:41.654
YOU MUST DO ANOTHER
SIX-HOUR TATTOO.

13:41.737 --> 13:42.738
- HOO, [bleep].

13:42.821 --> 13:44.323
- WHAT THE [bleep]?

13:44.406 --> 13:46.242
- FOR YOUR VERY FIRST CHALLENGE
IN THIS COMPETITION,

13:46.325 --> 13:49.078
YOU TATTOOED CONVENTION STYLE
TO EARN YOUR SHOP.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.287
THAT DAY WAS INTENSE,

13:50.371 --> 13:52.206
AND EVERY ARTIST
WAS UNDER PRESSURE.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.416
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT MEANT THAT
SOME OF THE CANVASES LEFT

13:54.500 --> 13:57.294
WITH JACKED TATTOOS.

13:57.378 --> 14:01.840
TODAY, IT'S UP TO YOU
TO COVER THE WORST OF THEM.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.175
YOU'LL BE JUDGED
ON BOTH YOUR TATTOOS

14:03.259 --> 14:05.344
TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOU'RE
HEADED TO THE FINALE

14:05.427 --> 14:07.429
OR HEADED HOME.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.430
- WOW.

14:08.514 --> 14:09.932
- [bleep].

14:10.015 --> 14:11.600
- THE MOST FREQUENTLY ASKED
QUESTION I GET IS,

14:11.684 --> 14:12.810
"WHAT HAPPENS
TO THOSE POOR PEOPLE

14:12.893 --> 14:14.770
THAT GET THOSE
JACKED UP TATTOOS?"

14:14.853 --> 14:17.314
WELL, THE FINAL FOUR,
THE BEST GUYS IN THE BUILDING,

14:17.398 --> 14:18.774
ARE GONNA FIX THOSE PEOPLE.

14:18.857 --> 14:20.442
- WE'VE NEVER HAD IT
BE THIS CLOSE.

14:20.526 --> 14:21.569
THIS IS THE REAL [bleep] DEAL.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.654
THIS LAST TATTOO RIGHT HERE,
THIS IS IT.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.573
THIS IS BALLS TO
THE [bleep] WALL TATTOO,

14:25.656 --> 14:27.283
AND IT NEEDS TO BE BAD-ASS.

14:27.366 --> 14:27.866
- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

14:34.039 --> 14:37.960
THIS IS LANCE,
WHO WAS TATTOOED BY GENTLE JAY.

14:38.043 --> 14:42.381
NEXT IS NIKKI,
WHO WAS TATTOOED BY KING RUCK.

14:42.464 --> 14:46.677
THIS IS SIYAD,
WHO WAS TATTOOED BY MELISSA,

14:46.760 --> 14:48.637
AND FINALLY THIS IS JESSICA.

14:48.721 --> 14:49.847
NOW, JESSICA HAD
A TATTOO DONE BY JIM

14:49.930 --> 14:52.766
BUT HAD A BAD REACTION
TO THE RED INK.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.810
IT'S UNSAFE TO COVER UP
HER TATTOO,

14:54.893 --> 14:56.937
SO SHE IS
AN OPEN-PLACEMENT CANVAS

14:57.021 --> 14:59.273
AND THERE IS NO COVER-UP.

14:59.356 --> 15:00.649
- WOW.

15:00.733 --> 15:04.862
- THIS IS A SERIOUS ADVANTAGE.

15:06.238 --> 15:08.991
THERE'S JUST ONE MORE THING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

15:09.074 --> 15:14.288
TODAY, THE POWER IS THE HANDS
OF THE CANVASES.

15:14.371 --> 15:18.000
EACH CANVAS WILL HAVE
TEN MINUTES TO INTERVIEW YOU.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.377
YOU NEED TO CONVINCE THE CANVAS
THAT YOU WANT

15:20.461 --> 15:22.171
THAT YOU'RE THE ARTIST FOR THEM.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.464
AFTER THE INTERVIEWS,

15:23.547 --> 15:24.840
THE CANVASES
WILL CHOOSE THE ARTIST

15:24.923 --> 15:26.675
THAT THEY THINK CAN GIVE THEM
THE TATTOO THAT THEY WANT.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.345
- JUST LIKE KICKBALL.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.513
- IF YOU GOT A GOOD RAPPORT
WITH ONE OF THE CANVASES

15:31.597 --> 15:32.473
AND YOU REALLY WANT TO
PUSH FOR IT,

15:32.556 --> 15:34.516
YOU SELL THEM ON
WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR THEM

15:34.600 --> 15:36.018
AND GET THEM TO PICK YOU.

15:36.101 --> 15:36.894
- YOU CAN COVER
OR YOU CAN RE-WORK,

15:36.977 --> 15:39.188
SO YOU CAN USE
WHAT YOU HAVE.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.106
- WE'RE NOT JUDGING IT
AS A COVER-UP CHALLENGE.

15:41.190 --> 15:44.193
WE'RE JUDGING IT
AS THE BEST TATTOO.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.194
- SIX-HOUR TATTOO.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.862
BALLS TO THE WALL.

15:46.945 --> 15:47.655
- WHATEVER YOU DO,
MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ENOUGH

15:47.738 --> 15:49.990
TO KEEP YOU IN THE BUILDING.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.492
- ALL RIGHT, ARTISTS.

15:51.575 --> 15:55.412
HEAD TO YOUR SHOPS
FOR YOUR FIRST INTERVIEW.

15:55.496 --> 15:56.538
- HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.790
- GO AHEAD AND HAVE A SEAT.

15:57.873 --> 16:00.459
SO YOU HAVE A HUGE SKULL
ON YOUR FOREARM.

16:00.542 --> 16:01.085
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, MAN?

16:01.168 --> 16:02.544
WHAT ARE YOUR IDEAS?

16:02.628 --> 16:03.671
- OBVIOUSLY IT'S A CIRCLE.

16:03.754 --> 16:05.798
I WAS THINKING MAYBE EVEN INSIDE
OF A JET ENGINE.

16:05.881 --> 16:07.883
- I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW
THAT THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

16:07.966 --> 16:08.884
- WHAT'S YOUR FORTE?

16:08.967 --> 16:10.552
- IT'S NOT COVER-UPS.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.221
{\an8}I COULD QUITE POSSIBLY COVER
ANY OF THESE TATTOOS UP,

16:12.304 --> 16:14.098
{\an8}BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M HERE
TO FIGHT FOR.

16:14.181 --> 16:17.017
I'M HERE TO FIGHT FOR
MY SPOT IN THE FINALE

16:17.101 --> 16:18.811
AND I'M TAKING THE ADVANTAGE.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.566
- I WOULDN'T BE YOUR GUY.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.068
- WITH ME,
YOU'RE GETTING FRESH SKIN.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.361
- UH-HUH.

16:27.444 --> 16:28.404
- YOU'RE NOT DOING A COVER-UP.
- YEAH.

16:28.487 --> 16:32.574
- ALL RIGHT, CANVASES,
SWITCH ROOMS.

16:32.658 --> 16:33.951
- WHAT'S UP, MAN?

16:34.034 --> 16:35.244
HOW ARE YOU DOIN'?
- I'M GOOD.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.328
- I'M SCOTT.
COME ON IN.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.246
HAVE A SEAT.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.580
- WHAT DID YOU WANT TO GET DONE?

16:38.664 --> 16:39.581
- I HAVE A COLLAGE OF FLOWERS
I WANT.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.208
- TO BE HONEST,
I'M ACTUALLY GLAD

16:41.291 --> 16:42.584
BECAUSE I DO NOT
DO COVER-UPS.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.169
I ONLY WORK
ON FRESH SKIN AT HOME,

16:44.253 --> 16:46.422
AND BRIGHT COLORS
IS DEFINITELY MY FORTE.

16:46.505 --> 16:49.633
EVERY ADVANTAGE I CAN GET,
I'M GOING TO TAKE IT.

16:49.717 --> 16:50.759
I WOULD PICK ME.

16:50.843 --> 16:51.343
- [laughs]
- I'D PICK ME.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.762
[laughs]

16:53.846 --> 16:56.223
- AND SWITCH PLEASE.

16:56.306 --> 16:57.641
- SO WE'RE GONNA DO
A THIGH PIECE.

16:57.725 --> 16:58.517
FRESH SKIN.
- OH, WOW.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.560
AWESOME.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.353
YOU KNOW, I'D LOVE TO DO
THIS PIECE.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.104
I'VE BEEN AT THE TOP
OF THIS COMPETITION

17:02.187 --> 17:03.981
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE THING,

17:04.064 --> 17:04.940
SO WHEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE
A CHOICE, CHOOSE ME.

17:05.022 --> 17:07.984
- SO EVERYONE'S BEEN RUNNING.

17:08.068 --> 17:10.362
{\an8}- THIS IS A MESS.

17:10.445 --> 17:12.156
BECAUSE THIS IS SO BIG

17:12.239 --> 17:13.699
AND YOUR COVER-UPS ARE USUALLY
TWO TO THREE TIMES LARGER

17:13.781 --> 17:15.117
THAN WHAT YOU HAVE,

17:15.200 --> 17:16.785
I THINK WHAT WE COULD DO
IS DEFINITELY GO IN HERE

17:16.868 --> 17:18.619
AND DO A REALLY NICE CIRCLE,
PUT MONUMENTS IN...

17:18.704 --> 17:19.663
- OKAY.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.039
- AND THEN USE ELEMENTS
OF THE MAP AROUND.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.624
I DON'T WANT THIS CANVAS.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.917
- YOU HAVE HAD THE BEST IDEAS
SO FAR.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.712
- SWITCH ROOMS.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.172
- ALL RIGHT, MATTI,

17:28.255 --> 17:29.840
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT
MY SUGAR SKULL.

17:29.923 --> 17:32.301
- THE BODY OF A DRAGON,
BUT I WANT THE HEAD OF A LION.

17:32.384 --> 17:33.302
- I DON'T DO COVER-UPS.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.344
- YOU DON'T DO COVER-UPS?

17:34.428 --> 17:35.471
OKAY.
- PERIOD.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.264
LIKE, PERIOD, AT ALL.
- RIGHT.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.141
- I KNOW THAT I'M PUTTING
ALL MY EGGS IN ONE BASKET,

17:39.224 --> 17:40.350
{\an8}BUT I DON'T CARE.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.852
{\an8}I NEED TO MAKE IT
TO THAT FINALE.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.479
IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULD STICK WITH SOMEBODY

17:43.562 --> 17:45.147
THAT HAD AN IDEA AT LEAST,

17:45.230 --> 17:47.232
'CAUSE I HAVE NO [bleep] IDEA.

17:51.361 --> 17:52.821
- ALL RIGHT, ARTISTS.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.324
THE CANVASES HAVE BEEN
RANDOMLY ASSIGNED AN ORDER

17:55.407 --> 17:56.492
TO CHOOSE AN ARTIST.

17:56.575 --> 17:57.743
JESSICA, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

17:57.826 --> 18:00.078
- THIS ONE'S HARD.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.288
I'M GONNA GO WITH...

18:06.418 --> 18:07.503
HALO.

18:10.631 --> 18:11.590
- LANCE?

18:11.673 --> 18:13.342
- I'M GONNA TAKE SCOTT.
- COOL, MAN.

18:13.425 --> 18:14.468
- SIYAD, YOU'RE UP NEXT.

18:14.551 --> 18:16.345
- SAUSAGE.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.096
{\an8}- THIS IS DEFINITELY
THE HARDEST CANVAS.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.265
THIS TATTOO, IT'S GONNA BE
A BITCH TO COVER UP.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.392
- AND THAT MEANS NIKKI,
YOU'RE WITH MATTI.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.019
- AWESOME.

18:24.102 --> 18:25.479
- YOU HAVE THE REST OF THE NIGHT
TO CONSULT.

18:25.562 --> 18:29.274
TOMORROW, YOU WILL HAVE
SIX HOURS TO DO YOUR TATTOOS.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.151
GOOD LUCK.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.195
- AWESOME, MAN.
- LET'S DO IT.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.655
- HIGH-FIVE.

18:34.738 --> 18:35.864
- WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE
THESE GUYS

18:35.948 --> 18:37.366
PUT ALL THE SKILLS

18:37.449 --> 18:39.368
THAT WE'VE TESTED 'EM ON
TO USE TODAY.

18:39.451 --> 18:40.828
THIS IS GONNA BE THE TIGHTEST
BATTLE THAT WE'VE HAD YET.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.705
NOW IT'S A MATTER OF WHO'S GONNA
REALLY TAKE THE PRIZE.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.290
- THE TATTOO
THAT I'M GONNA DO ON YOU

18:45.374 --> 18:47.292
IS WHAT'S GONNA TRY TO
LAND ME IN THE TOP THREE.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.210
- RIGHT.

18:48.293 --> 18:49.503
- AND SO I REALLY WANT TO

18:49.586 --> 18:50.921
KIND OF PULL OUT
ALL THE STOPS FOR THIS.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.548
- IF I CAN MANIPULATE IT AROUND

18:52.631 --> 18:53.966
OR COVER IT WITH ANOTHER VERSION
OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

18:54.049 --> 18:55.175
I COULD PROBABLY DO THAT.

18:55.259 --> 18:56.844
- I TRUST YOUR JUDGMENT.
- AWESOME.

18:56.927 --> 18:59.847
- THERE IS $100,000 ON THE LINE.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.224
I GOT YOU.
I PROMISE.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.058
- I SCARED THE [bleep]
OUT OF THE ONE GUY.

19:03.141 --> 19:05.477
{\an8}I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIS NAME.

19:05.561 --> 19:08.313
{\an8}- YEAH, YEAH,
HE'S JUST, LIKE, "[bleep] NO."

19:08.397 --> 19:09.982
{\an8}- I THINK IT'S A COP-OUT
FOR HALO TO SAY

19:10.065 --> 19:11.400
{\an8}THAT HE DOESN'T DO COVER-UPS

19:11.483 --> 19:13.068
{\an8}WHEN HE WON ON
A COVER-UP CHALLENGE.

19:13.151 --> 19:14.820
- HE'S JUST LIKE,
"DUDE, I AM NOT YOUR MAN.

19:14.903 --> 19:15.904
"IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU.

19:15.988 --> 19:16.905
HAVE A NICE DAY."

19:16.989 --> 19:18.490
- NO [bleep].

19:18.574 --> 19:19.449
IF YOU WANT TO PLAY LIKE
A LITTLE PUSSY,

19:19.533 --> 19:22.286
JUST PACK YOUR BAGS
AND GO HOME.

19:35.507 --> 19:38.594
- I FOUGHT TOOTH AND NAIL
TO GET TO THIS POINT.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.220
I'M GONNA WIN THIS BATTLE,

19:40.304 --> 19:42.347
AND I'M GONNA CLAIM MY SPOT
IN THE TOP THREE.

19:42.431 --> 19:43.849
- I'VE SPENT MY ENTIRE CAREER
PREPARING FOR THIS.

19:43.932 --> 19:46.435
IT'S DO OR DIE TIME.

19:46.518 --> 19:47.936
- IT'S ALL OR NOTHING.

19:48.020 --> 19:48.896
I WANT TO WIN IT,
AND I'M GOING TO WIN IT.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.023
- THE BELL IS ABOUT TO RING.

19:51.106 --> 19:51.982
THE FIGHT'S ON.

19:52.065 --> 19:53.942
THIS IS FOR REAL NOW.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.068
I TAKE IT THIS IS MATTI'S?

19:55.152 --> 19:56.778
[sighs]

19:56.862 --> 19:58.113
I'D BE SO SCARED TO
TAKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON.

19:58.196 --> 20:00.616
WHEN SHE CAME IN
WITH THAT PIECE, DUDE,

20:00.699 --> 20:02.117
I WAS SO SCARED OF IT.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.619
{\an8}I GOT EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.245
{\an8}THE BLANK CANVAS PICKED ME.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.247
{\an8}I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
DOING A COVER-UP.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.207
ADVANTAGE, HALO.

20:09.291 --> 20:09.625
- YOU PRETTY CONFIDENT, DUDE?

20:09.708 --> 20:12.085
- NO.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.795
I-I WON'T BE CONFIDENT UNTIL
THEY GO,

20:13.879 --> 20:15.464
"ALL RIGHT, SAUSAGE,

20:15.547 --> 20:16.798
YOU'RE NOW IN THE TOP THREE."

20:24.973 --> 20:26.266
- ALL RIGHT, ARTISTS.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.894
YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO DO YOUR TATTOOS.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.312
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE
TO PROVE

20:30.395 --> 20:33.065
THAT YOU DESERVE A SPOT
IN THE LIVE FINALE.

20:33.148 --> 20:35.859
YOUR TIME BEGINS NOW.

20:35.943 --> 20:36.652
- LET'S DO IT, MAN.

20:36.735 --> 20:37.945
- READY TO BE AWESOME-IZED?

20:38.028 --> 20:39.613
- I AM READY.

20:39.696 --> 20:41.657
{\an8}- THIS FINAL TATTOO SHOULD BE
THE ICING ON THE CAKE

20:41.740 --> 20:44.910
{\an8}OF EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE
THROUGHOUT THIS COMPETITION.

20:44.993 --> 20:47.663
- THIS TATTOO
IS AN EXCUSELESS TATTOO.

20:47.746 --> 20:48.497
I'M NOT GIVING 'EM
[bleep] TO SAY.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.415
- NO SLACKING.
NO HOLDING BACK.

20:50.499 --> 20:51.959
THIS IS THE ONE
TO TAKE YOU TO THE FINALE

20:52.042 --> 20:52.876
OR SEND YOU HOME.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.378
- THE BIGGEST THING IS GONNA BE

20:54.461 --> 20:56.380
WORKING WITH THE EXISTING PIECE
THAT YOU HAVE.

20:56.463 --> 20:57.839
- OKAY.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.633
- TRYING TO TURN THAT CIRCLE
INTO A REAL CIRCLE.

20:59.716 --> 21:01.343
I'M GONNA RETOUCH THIS TATTOO
INSTEAD OF COVERING IT UP,

21:01.426 --> 21:04.513
AND THEN TATTOO LANDMARKS
FROM AROUND THE WORLD

21:04.596 --> 21:06.014
AS A COLLAGE AROUND HIS ARM.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.474
TIME PERMITTING,
IF BERLIN WORKS,

21:07.557 --> 21:08.725
THEN WE'LL DO CENTRAL AMERICA.

21:08.809 --> 21:09.935
IS THAT ALL RIGHT WITH YOU?

21:10.018 --> 21:11.186
- IT SOUNDS GREAT.
- AWESOME.

21:11.269 --> 21:13.689
I CAN NAIL EVERY SINGLE SKILL
IN THIS ONE PIECE.

21:13.772 --> 21:14.731
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY,
YOU READY?

21:14.815 --> 21:15.774
I'M HERE TO WIN,

21:15.857 --> 21:17.526
AND SOMEBODY ELSE
IS GONNA GO HOME,

21:17.609 --> 21:19.361
BECAUSE THAT SPOT IN THE FINALE
IS MINE.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.196
- I CAN ALREADY SEE IT NOW.

21:21.279 --> 21:24.741
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HOLDING SIGNS
THAT SAYS, "WE WANT SAUSAGE."

21:24.825 --> 21:26.284
- THAT WOULD BE PRETTY SWEET.

21:26.368 --> 21:28.662
{\an8}- SAUSAGE'S ARTWORK
LOOKS GENERIC

21:28.745 --> 21:31.123
{\an8}AND VERY CLIP ART
AND CUT AND PASTED TO ME.

21:31.206 --> 21:31.957
THERE IS NO WAY
THAT SAUSAGE'S TATTOO

21:32.040 --> 21:34.543
IS GONNA BEAT MY TATTOO TODAY.

21:34.626 --> 21:35.877
WOULDN'T BE A TATTOO
IF IT DIDN'T HURT LIKE [bleep].

21:35.961 --> 21:37.796
[laughter]

21:37.879 --> 21:39.047
- I KNOW, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.382
I'VE BEEN KICKING [bleep]
ASS THIS WHOLE TIME.

21:40.465 --> 21:43.176
I GOT TO JUST KEEP DOING
WHAT I'M DOING.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.428
- NO PAIN, NO GAIN.

21:44.511 --> 21:45.929
- WHEN I'M DONE
WITH THIS TATTOO,

21:46.013 --> 21:47.806
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL
IT'S A COVER-UP

21:47.889 --> 21:50.017
AND IT'S GONNA BE SCREAMING
"SCOTT MARSHALL" ALL OVER IT.

21:50.100 --> 21:52.269
- YOU HAVE FOUR HOURS REMAINING.

21:55.313 --> 21:58.108
{\an8}- MY STRATEGY IS NOT ONLY
TO DO A COVER-UP

21:58.191 --> 22:00.193
{\an8}BUT TO PLACE A REALLY NICE
TATTOO RIGHT NEXT TO IT

22:00.277 --> 22:02.738
{\an8}AND MAKE THEM BOTH
WORK TOGETHER.

22:02.821 --> 22:03.613
- WHAT'S GOING ON, GUYS?

22:03.697 --> 22:05.866
- WHOA, SHOOT.
- WHOA-LY MOLEY.

22:05.949 --> 22:08.577
- WANT TO SEE THE COVER-UP?

22:08.660 --> 22:10.537
- I'M NERVOUS THAT RUCK'S
MISTAKE'S GONNA SHOW THROUGH,

22:10.620 --> 22:14.416
SO I HAVE TO GO WALL TO WALL
WITH COLOR IN THE ROSES.

22:14.499 --> 22:17.085
I'M GONNA DO THE BEST I CAN,
AND IF THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH,

22:17.169 --> 22:18.795
TURN HER ARM AROUND,

22:18.879 --> 22:20.088
AND THERE'S A PERFECTLY
GOOD TATTOO ON THE OTHER SIDE.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.590
- OH, YOU DOING MORE FLOWERS?

22:21.673 --> 22:24.176
- THERE'S A REASON BEHIND
ALL THE FLOWERS.

22:24.259 --> 22:25.719
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE A COVER-UP,
RIGHT?

22:25.802 --> 22:27.929
- I CAME IN WITH EXACTLY
WHAT I WANTED.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.181
I KNEW WHAT FLOWERS I WANTED.

22:29.264 --> 22:30.932
- SHE WAS DEFINITELY
THE SAFER ROUTE,

22:31.016 --> 22:32.934
SO I'M NOT GONNA PRETEND
LIKE I DIDN'T WANT HER,

22:33.018 --> 22:34.561
BUT I'M GONNA DO
THE BEST TATTOO I CAN

22:34.644 --> 22:36.313
THE WAY I KNOW HOW TO DO IT.

22:36.396 --> 22:38.690
I'M BEING MORE METICULOUS
THAN I'VE EVER BEEN.

22:38.774 --> 22:41.443
THESE FLOWERS ARE MY TICKET
TO THE FINAL THREE.

22:41.526 --> 22:44.029
- TWO HOURS REMAIN, EVERYONE.

22:44.112 --> 22:45.489
- KIND OF A WEIRD CHOICE

22:45.572 --> 22:48.283
TO PUT THE EXCLAMATION POINT
ON THIS THING.

22:48.366 --> 22:49.367
- THIS BEING
YOUR ONE LAST CHANCE

22:49.451 --> 22:51.745
TO REALLY BLOW SOMETHING OUT OF
THE WATER,

22:51.828 --> 22:56.458
AND YOU DO A VERY SIMILAR TATTOO
OF A TATTOO YOU JUST DID.

22:56.541 --> 22:59.086
- AND THEN MATTI'S,
WE'LL SEE HOW DYNAMIC IT IS.

22:59.169 --> 23:00.754
- CURIOUS TO SEE HOW SCOTT,

23:00.837 --> 23:04.216
SOME OF THAT LITTLE COVER-UP
AREAS ARE GONNA DO.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.051
- I'M DOING SOMETHING BOLD

23:06.134 --> 23:08.637
BY PUTTING A LOT OF BRIGHT
CANARY YELLOW INTO THIS PIECE,

23:08.720 --> 23:10.764
AND REALLY JUST PUSH IT
OVER THE TOP.

23:10.847 --> 23:11.640
- SAUSY.

23:11.723 --> 23:14.518
- HAVE YOU SEEN SCOTT'S PIECE?

23:14.601 --> 23:15.852
- SCOTT'S YOU CAN STILL SEE
THE COVER-UP RIGHT THROUGH IT.

23:15.936 --> 23:18.146
- OH, NO.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.148
USING YELLOW AS A COVER-UP
IS A HUGE NO-NO,

23:20.232 --> 23:22.359
BECAUSE YOU CAN STILL SEE
THE OLD PIECE UNDERNEATH IT.

23:22.442 --> 23:24.653
THIS MIGHT BE ENOUGH
TO SEND HIS ASS HOME.

23:24.736 --> 23:26.404
- 30 MINUTES REMAINING,
EVERYONE.

23:29.825 --> 23:32.035
- THIS IS THE HIGHEST
THE STAKES HAVE EVER BEEN

23:32.119 --> 23:33.954
IN THIS COMPETITION.

23:34.037 --> 23:35.622
IF I'M GONNA GO DOWN,
I'M GONNA GO DOWN FIGHTING.

23:36.414 --> 23:42.546
- FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO...

23:42.629 --> 23:43.588
- [groans]

23:43.672 --> 23:45.382
- ONE.

23:45.465 --> 23:46.925
TIME IS UP.
MACHINES DOWN.

23:47.008 --> 23:48.885
NO MORE INK.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.054
- [bleep] YEAH.

23:51.138 --> 23:52.097
- TAKE A LOOK.

23:52.180 --> 23:53.557
- WOW.

23:53.640 --> 23:54.975
- OH, IT IS AMAZING.

23:55.058 --> 23:56.434
- HOLY [bleep].

23:59.062 --> 24:00.772
- I LOVE IT.

24:00.856 --> 24:02.315
- GREAT.

24:02.399 --> 24:03.942
YEAH, THE THING'S GONE.
- COMPLETELY.

24:04.025 --> 24:07.070
- MATTI'S COVER-UP JUST LOOKS
LIKE A BIG, BLUE BLOB.

24:07.154 --> 24:08.363
SOMETIMES HE DOES GOOD

24:08.446 --> 24:10.157
AND SOMETIMES HE DOES
CRAP LIKE THIS.

24:10.240 --> 24:10.448
IT'S TIME TO GET RID OF HIM.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.579
{\an8}I PUT MY ALL INTO EVERY SINGLE
TATTOO THAT I DO.

24:15.662 --> 24:19.124
{\an8}- IF YOU GAVE ME 35 HOURS
AGAINST THESE GUYS,

24:19.207 --> 24:20.876
{\an8}THEY SHOULD BE SCARED.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.670
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

24:28.967 --> 24:30.177
- HALO, HOW'D YOURS GO?

24:30.260 --> 24:31.469
- I'M SO HAPPY WITH IT, DUDE.

24:31.553 --> 24:33.346
I'M CONFIDENT AS [bleep] IN IT.

24:33.430 --> 24:35.056
- YOU DIDN'T DO A COVER-UP,
RIGHT?

24:35.140 --> 24:36.099
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DO MY GUY.

24:36.183 --> 24:37.225
YOU TURNED HIM AWAY.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.727
- I DIDN'T REALLY TURN HIM AWAY.

24:38.810 --> 24:39.936
I JUST SAID, "TALK TO THAT GUY.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.104
HE DOES GOOD COVER-UPS."

24:41.188 --> 24:42.230
- BUT HE TOLD ME
THAT YOU TOLD HIM

24:42.314 --> 24:43.440
THAT YOU DON'T DO COVER-UPS.

24:43.523 --> 24:44.399
- IT'S HONESTY.

24:44.482 --> 24:45.734
I DON'T DO COVER-UPS.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.110
THAT IS A FACT.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.863
- IT'S A FACT THAT HALO
CAN DO COVER-UPS.

24:49.946 --> 24:51.698
HALO WON THE LAST COVER-UP
CHALLENGE.

24:51.781 --> 24:55.327
I SAT DOWN HERE STRESSING AND
WORKING MY ASS OFF.

24:55.410 --> 24:57.078
- WE WERE ALL STRUGGLING WITH
THOSE DESIGNS.

24:57.162 --> 24:58.496
HALO WAS THE ONLY ONE
WALKING AROUND,

24:58.580 --> 25:00.081
"DOOPY-DOOPY-DO-DO-DO,"

25:00.165 --> 25:01.041
'CAUSE HE WASN'T DOING A
COVER-UP.

25:01.124 --> 25:02.042
- OKAY.

25:02.125 --> 25:03.418
{\an8}- HALO'S TAKEN
THE EASY WAY OUT.

25:03.501 --> 25:04.461
{\an8}- I SHOWED YOU TWO

25:04.544 --> 25:05.754
{\an8}REALLY [bleep] STRONG PIECES.

25:05.837 --> 25:06.463
- I'M NOT IMPRESSED, DUDE.

25:06.546 --> 25:08.131
- IT'S NOT UP TO YOU.

25:21.728 --> 25:25.690
- ARTISTS, THIS WAS YOUR LAST
CHANCE TO PROVE

25:25.774 --> 25:29.402
THAT YOU DESERVE TO COMPETE
IN THE LIVE FINALE FOR $100,000,

25:29.486 --> 25:32.239
A FEATURE IN <i> INKED</i> MAGAZINE,

25:32.322 --> 25:35.116
AND THE TITLE OF INK MASTER.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.201
SAUSAGE.

25:37.619 --> 25:38.745
LET'S START WITH
YOUR MASTECTOMY TATTOO.

25:38.828 --> 25:41.623
- THE THING I LIKE THE MOST
ABOUT THIS TATTOO

25:41.706 --> 25:43.083
IS I LOVE THE WAY IT FITS.

25:43.166 --> 25:44.584
I LOVE THAT IT'S NOT
SYMMETRICAL.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.294
I THINK IT GIVES IT
A UNIQUE LOOK.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.003
IT'S JUST A REAL QUALITY JOB,
MAN.

25:47.087 --> 25:48.546
- THANK YOU.

25:48.630 --> 25:51.424
- LET'S MOVE ALONG
TO YOUR SIX-HOUR TATTOO.

25:51.508 --> 25:54.427
YOU RE-WORKED MELISSA'S TATTOO.

25:54.511 --> 25:56.554
- TO TRY TO DO A COVER-UP
AND BUILD IN A TON OF BLACK

25:56.638 --> 25:57.555
DIDN'T MAKE SENSE,

25:57.639 --> 25:59.474
SO I DECIDED TO ADD SOMETHING

25:59.557 --> 26:01.142
THAT'S A LOT MORE BOLD AND
STYLISH TO THE AIRPLANE ITSELF

26:01.226 --> 26:03.395
AND THEN BUILD A SLEEVE

26:03.478 --> 26:04.771
THAT HE CAN ADD ON TO
AT ANY TIME.

26:04.854 --> 26:06.606
- THIS IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE
VERY HARD

26:06.690 --> 26:07.649
FOR PEOPLE TO WORK OFF

26:07.732 --> 26:10.986
BECAUSE THE QUALITY'S
REALLY HIGH.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.237
THIS IS SHOWING VERSATILITY.

26:12.320 --> 26:13.905
TO COME OUT HERE AND SHOW,

26:13.989 --> 26:15.532
"I JUST DID THESE BIG,
BRAVE FLOWERS.

26:15.615 --> 26:16.825
"NOW I'M GONNA DO THIS REALLY
FINE-LINE DETAIL

26:16.908 --> 26:20.078
AND REALLY SHOW SOME NICE SOFT
BLACK AND GRAY."

26:20.161 --> 26:21.204
IT'S TOP-NOTCH.

26:21.288 --> 26:22.956
- THIS IS SUCH A UNIQUE WAY

26:23.039 --> 26:25.583
TO PUT THESE DIFFERENT IDEAS
TOGETHER INTO ONE TATTOO.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.419
YOU DIDN'T JUST
COOKIE-CUTTER IT TOGETHER.

26:27.502 --> 26:29.087
THIS IS WHAT WE WERE
LOOKING FOR.

26:29.170 --> 26:31.298
WE ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
TO REALLY PUT UP A FIGHT

26:31.381 --> 26:32.507
AND DO SOMETHING
ABOVE AND BEYOND,

26:32.590 --> 26:34.467
AND I FEEL LIKE YOU'VE DONE IT.

26:34.551 --> 26:36.052
- THANK YOU GUYS
VERY, VERY MUCH.

26:40.181 --> 26:41.182
- SCOTT.

26:43.727 --> 26:46.313
- THIS WASN'T NECESSARILY
A COVER SCAR CHALLENGE.

26:46.396 --> 26:49.357
THE CHALLENGE WAS DEALING WITH
THESE LADIES' SITUATION

26:49.441 --> 26:51.276
AND GIVING THEM SOMETHING
BEAUTIFUL TO BE PROUD OF,

26:51.359 --> 26:52.861
AND JUST TAKING YOUR TIME

26:52.944 --> 26:56.323
TO DO THESE REALLY SOFT
LITTLE DETAILED BUTTERFLIES

26:56.406 --> 26:58.533
WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE.

26:58.616 --> 27:01.202
- LET'S MOVE ON TO YOUR
FINAL ELIMINATION TATTOO.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.204
- OVERALL, THE COLOR PALETTE
IS STRONG.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.206
REALLY SOLID,
CLEAN APPLICATION.

27:05.290 --> 27:06.750
IT HAS YOUR SIGNATURE
ALL OVER IT.

27:06.833 --> 27:07.876
- UP CLOSE,
YOU CAN DEFINITELY SEE

27:07.959 --> 27:10.545
THE NAUTICAL STAR GHOST
OUTLINE THROUGH THERE.

27:10.628 --> 27:12.547
IF THIS COULD HAVE BEEN
MOVED OVER JUST A LITTLE BIT

27:12.630 --> 27:13.506
TO KEEP THAT
OUT OF THAT YELLOW LIP,

27:13.590 --> 27:15.633
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.

27:15.717 --> 27:17.385
- NO MATTER WHERE I MOVED IT,

27:17.469 --> 27:18.762
IT WAS POKING OUT HERE,
POKING OUT THERE, SO--

27:18.845 --> 27:20.764
- BUT YOU KNOW YELLOW'S
NOT COVERING [bleep].

27:25.435 --> 27:28.438
- MATTI.

27:28.521 --> 27:29.731
- LET ME COMMEND YOU
ON HAVING GOOD TASTE

27:29.814 --> 27:34.402
TO PICK THE PROPER-SHAPED FLOWER
TO PUT ON HER CHEST.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.738
THE WAY THAT THE FLOWER'S
CLOSING ON THE OUTSIDE

27:36.821 --> 27:38.281
AND BLOWING OPEN ON THE INSIDE,

27:38.365 --> 27:39.324
YOU'RE DRAWING WITH A MOVEMENT,

27:39.407 --> 27:42.077
AND THAT'S A GREAT THING.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.913
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ALONG TO
YOUR FINAL ELIMINATION TATTOO.

27:44.996 --> 27:46.873
- WHEN I LOOK AT THIS TATTOO
FROM A DISTANCE,

27:46.956 --> 27:49.250
IT HAS A COVER-UP FEEL JUST
'CAUSE THE BLUE IS SO DARK.

27:49.334 --> 27:50.919
THE TATTOO THAT'S NOT
THE COVER-UP,

27:51.002 --> 27:52.253
I LOVE THE LAYOUT.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.755
I LOVE HOW MUCH OPEN SKIN
YOU LEFT IN IT.

27:53.838 --> 27:54.839
THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME HARP ON

27:54.923 --> 27:58.051
THE BLUE ROSES BEING SO DENSE
EVEN MORE.

27:58.134 --> 28:00.720
- THE SAME-SIZED ROSES,
IT'S A BIT MUCH,

28:00.804 --> 28:03.264
BECAUSE EVERYTHING THE SAME SIZE
MAKES A MOSAIC LOOK.

28:03.348 --> 28:06.267
IF YOU STAGGER THE SIZES
WITH BIGGER LEAVES

28:06.351 --> 28:07.227
AND THEN MAYBE LITTLE BUDS,

28:07.310 --> 28:09.104
YOU CAN GET MORE
BANG FOR YOUR BUCK

28:09.187 --> 28:09.604
AND MORE DYNAMICS.

28:09.687 --> 28:11.689
LOOKING AT THIS,

28:11.773 --> 28:14.818
THE EYE IS JUST TOTALLY DRAWN
TO THE BLUE SPOT.

28:17.737 --> 28:20.949
- HALO.

28:21.032 --> 28:22.826
- YOU'RE A CANCER SURVIVOR
YOURSELF.

28:22.909 --> 28:24.202
- YEAH.

28:24.285 --> 28:25.453
- DID THIS ONE HIT HOME
FOR YOU HOME SO THAN--

28:25.537 --> 28:27.997
- DUDE, I HAVE NEVER STAYED UP
TILL 3:30 IN THE MORNING

28:28.081 --> 28:29.624
DRAWING FOUR FLOWERS.

28:29.707 --> 28:31.459
IT WAS INTENSE.
- YEAH.

28:31.543 --> 28:34.295
- WELL, HALO, MAN, I REALLY
LOVE THE WAY THIS TATTOO FITS.

28:34.379 --> 28:36.297
IT FLOWS WITH THE CURVE
OF THE BODY.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.550
I REALLY LIKE THE SOFT,

28:38.633 --> 28:40.552
OUT OF FOCUS ACCENTS
ON THE EDGES.

28:40.635 --> 28:42.470
IT REALLY DOES
CREATE THAT DEPTH,

28:42.554 --> 28:45.140
AND IT CREATES DIFFERENT
TEXTURES IN YOUR TATTOO.

28:45.223 --> 28:46.850
- WELL, SPEAKING OF FLOWERS,

28:46.933 --> 28:49.436
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR
FINAL ELIMINATION TATTOO.

28:49.519 --> 28:53.189
THIS CANVAS WAS COMPLETELY OPEN,
BRAND-NEW TATTOO,

28:53.273 --> 28:55.859
YET YOU JUST DID THIS.

28:55.942 --> 28:57.902
- IF I LOOK AT THIS TATTOO
AS A WHOLE

28:57.986 --> 29:00.280
AND I LOOK AT THE TATTOO
FROM YESTERDAY AS A WHOLE,

29:00.363 --> 29:02.323
THE ONE FROM YESTERDAY
HAS A BETTER AESTHETIC FEEL,

29:02.407 --> 29:03.616
FITS THE BODY BETTER.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.160
THAT TATTOO IS A BETTER TATTOO.

29:05.243 --> 29:07.912
IF YOU'RE GONNA DO
THE SAME THING AGAIN,

29:07.996 --> 29:10.540
YOU HAD A LOT MORE FREEDOM AND
A LOT MORE SIZE ON THIS TATTOO,

29:10.623 --> 29:12.333
THIS ONE
SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.

29:12.417 --> 29:15.170
- AH, DUDE, I [bleep]
KILLED MYSELF ON THIS ONE.

29:15.253 --> 29:17.672
- THE TATTOO OVERALL
IS A BEAUTIFUL TATTOO.

29:17.755 --> 29:18.506
THE WATER DROPLETS ON
THE PETALS,

29:18.590 --> 29:21.009
SUPER GLOSSY IN H.D.,

29:21.092 --> 29:23.303
BUT THEN YOU HAVE AREAS IN
THE FLOWERS THAT ARE VERY FLAT.

29:23.386 --> 29:25.555
THOSE PISTILS, THERE'S NO
OUTLINE ON ONE SIDE OF ONE.

29:25.638 --> 29:27.682
THE OUTLINES DON'T CONNECT.

29:27.765 --> 29:29.517
THEY'RE JUST KIND OF
HERE AND THERE.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.644
YOU DIDN'T PUT IN THE SAME LEVEL
OF WORK THROUGHOUT.

29:31.728 --> 29:32.896
YOU DIDN'T MAKE IT
AS INTERESTING

29:32.979 --> 29:34.397
AS YOU MADE IT BEFORE.

29:38.902 --> 29:42.113
- OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE
A HUGE DECISION AHEAD OF US.

29:43.698 --> 29:45.533
THREE OF YOU WILL
EARN THE OPPORTUNITY

29:45.617 --> 29:46.826
TO BATTLE IT OUT
IN THE LIVE FINALE,

29:46.910 --> 29:50.997
AND ONE OF YOU
WILL PACK YOUR MACHINES.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.499
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT,

29:52.582 --> 29:54.417
AND WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

30:00.215 --> 30:02.300
- I WOULD MUCH RATHER GO TO
THE FINALS WITH YOU AND MATTI.

30:02.383 --> 30:04.260
- WHY IS THAT?

30:04.344 --> 30:05.553
- BECAUSE I THINK HALO,

30:05.637 --> 30:06.971
GIVEN THE CHANCE TO DO
A MASTER CANVAS,

30:07.055 --> 30:08.806
WOULD KNOCK IT OUT
OF THE [bleep] PARK.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.308
- I'M NOT THREATENED BY ANYONE
IN THIS COMPETITION.

30:10.391 --> 30:12.519
- LOOK AT HIS PORTFOLIO.

30:12.602 --> 30:14.229
I MEAN HE'S--THAT'S GOT SOME--

30:14.312 --> 30:16.105
- BUT HAS HE BEEN THAT AMAZING
SINCE HE'S BEEN HERE, DUDE?

30:16.189 --> 30:17.148
- HIS WORK IS VERY DYNAMIC.

30:17.232 --> 30:17.941
- I DON'T SEE IT, DUDE.

30:18.024 --> 30:19.943
MATTI IS THE STRONGER ARTIST,

30:20.026 --> 30:21.486
AND I THINK MATTI'S GONNA BE
IN THE FINALE.

30:22.987 --> 30:24.822
- IT'S IN THE HANDS
OF THOSE THREE JUDGES.

30:24.906 --> 30:27.575
- IT WOULD [bleep]
SUCK TO GO HOME NOW.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.494
- YOU AND ME
ARE FIGHTING FOR THIRD.

30:29.577 --> 30:31.955
- I STILL FEEL PRETTY STRONG
ABOUT THE PIECE THAT I DID.

30:32.038 --> 30:33.456
I'M STILL IN THE FIGHT
RIGHT NOW.

30:33.540 --> 30:35.833
{\an8}I AM DEFINITELY GOING TO BE
IN THAT FINALE.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.377
I CAN GUARANTEE IT.

30:37.460 --> 30:39.379
- I KNOW I'M
A SOLID TATTOO ARTIST, MAN.

30:39.462 --> 30:41.422
I MADE IT TO THE TOP FOUR
IN THIS CONTEST.

30:41.506 --> 30:43.049
HALO BLEW IT TODAY, MAN.

30:43.132 --> 30:44.842
THERE AIN'T A WAY IN HELL
I'M GOING HOME.

30:44.926 --> 30:46.844
GIVE ME 35 HOURS
NEXT TO SCOTT AND SAUSAGE,

30:46.928 --> 30:48.888
AND I COULD KICK
BOTH OF THEIR ASSES.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.525
- THIS IS IT.

31:00.608 --> 31:01.609
FINAL ELIMINATION TATTOOS.

31:01.693 --> 31:04.779
FOUR GREAT ARTISTS REMAINING.

31:04.862 --> 31:07.407
ONLY THREE HEADED
TO THE LIVE FINALE.

31:07.490 --> 31:09.659
LET'S START OFF WITH SAUSAGE.

31:09.742 --> 31:10.952
DID A GREAT JOB
ON THE CANCER SURVIVOR.

31:11.035 --> 31:13.079
- IF YOU LOOK AT THE PISTILS
ON THESE FLOWERS,

31:13.162 --> 31:16.791
HE REALLY SHOWED
AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF DETAIL.

31:16.874 --> 31:17.875
- AND I ALSO LIKE THE FACT
THAT HE'S THE ONLY ONE

31:17.959 --> 31:20.545
TO HAVE DONE
REALLY BEAUTIFUL COLOR

31:20.628 --> 31:21.838
AND THEN SHOW UP WITH

31:21.921 --> 31:23.798
A PREDOMINATELY BLACK
AND GRAY TATTOO.

31:23.881 --> 31:26.676
- IT SHOWED A LOT OF CREATIVITY
TO RE-WORK THE EXISTING TATTOO

31:26.759 --> 31:29.929
SO IT FLOWED WITH THE PIECE.

31:30.013 --> 31:31.306
- NEXT UP IS HALO.

31:31.389 --> 31:33.474
- HE REALLY PUT A LOT
INTO THIS TATTOO,

31:33.558 --> 31:34.809
THE DETAILS
IN THE SMALLER FLOWERS,

31:34.892 --> 31:36.686
THE COLOR PALETTE, THE VIBRANCY,

31:36.769 --> 31:38.229
BUT IN THE NEXT TATTOO,

31:38.313 --> 31:40.690
HE EMULATED THIS
ON A LOWER STANDARD.

31:40.773 --> 31:42.483
- THE BUBBLES ARE REALLY H.D.,

31:42.567 --> 31:43.651
ALL THE STUFF IS REALLY NICE,

31:43.735 --> 31:45.486
BUT AS IMPRESSED AS I WAS

31:45.570 --> 31:47.864
WITH HIS COMPOSITION
ON THE FIRST TATTOO,

31:47.947 --> 31:49.949
I FEEL LIKE THIS ONE IS JUST
A REDO BUT NOT AS NICE.

31:51.993 --> 31:53.494
- SCOTT DID A REALLY NICE JOB

31:53.578 --> 31:54.912
WHEN IT CAME TO
THE CANCER SURVIVOR TATTOO.

31:54.996 --> 31:57.415
- HE'S VERY GOOD
PLEASING PEOPLE.

31:57.498 --> 31:58.916
HE DID A GREAT JOB
ON HER CHEST TATTOO.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.835
- LET'S TALK ABOUT
HIS ELIMINATION TATTOO.

32:00.918 --> 32:04.172
HE GOT GENTLE JAY'S
NAUTICAL STAR.

32:04.255 --> 32:05.673
- IF YOU LOOK CLOSE,

32:05.757 --> 32:07.592
YOU SEE THESE SMALL LITTLE LINES
SHOWING THROUGH.

32:07.675 --> 32:08.593
IF HE HAD JUST
MOVED THIS OVER

32:08.676 --> 32:10.178
IN THE HEAVY TEXTURE
HIDDEN AREAS,

32:10.261 --> 32:12.096
IT COULD HAVE JUST
BEEN THAT MUCH BETTER.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.348
- WHAT SCOTT DID IS,

32:13.431 --> 32:17.018
HE TRIED TO CAMOUFLAGE
WITH HIS DESIGN.

32:17.101 --> 32:18.019
- NEXT UP WE HAVE MATTI.

32:18.102 --> 32:19.854
BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS THERE.

32:19.937 --> 32:20.813
- HAS HIS STYLE.

32:20.897 --> 32:22.273
LOOKS VERY WELL TATTOOED.

32:22.357 --> 32:24.525
- LET'S MOVE INTO
HIS ELIMINATION TATTOO,

32:24.609 --> 32:26.778
THE COVER-UP
OF KING RUCK'S SUGAR SKULL.

32:26.861 --> 32:28.446
- HE'S DONE TWO SEPARATE TATTOOS

32:28.529 --> 32:30.281
THAT ARE JUST
ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.

32:30.365 --> 32:31.908
THEY DON'T FLOW TOGETHER WELL,

32:31.991 --> 32:34.619
AND THOSE FOUR ROSES LOOK LIKE
ONE BIG, BLUE BLOB.

32:34.702 --> 32:35.953
- IT'S DEFINITELY A DESIGN FLAW.

32:36.037 --> 32:39.332
- AND THIS IS
A CRAZY HARD DECISION.

32:39.415 --> 32:40.416
- I'M HAPPY THAT IT'S THIS CLOSE

32:40.500 --> 32:42.377
'CAUSE THAT MEANS WE HAVE
THIS MUCH

32:42.460 --> 32:44.212
QUALITY TATTOOING
GOING ON HERE.

32:44.295 --> 32:45.380
- LET'S LET 'EM KNOW.

32:48.966 --> 32:50.009
- HOLY [bleep],
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S THIS CLOSE.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.851
- ALL RIGHT, ARTISTS.

32:58.935 --> 33:00.895
THE JUDGES WANT TO SEE EVERYBODY
BACK IN THE SHOP.

33:04.148 --> 33:05.149
- LET'S JUST GO.

33:05.233 --> 33:05.983
COME ON.

33:15.993 --> 33:17.245
- TODAY, YOU HAD TO PROVE

33:17.328 --> 33:18.579
THAT YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES

33:18.663 --> 33:21.290
TO COMPETE IN THE LIVE FINALE.

33:21.374 --> 33:25.253
THE FOUR OF YOU HAVE BATTLED
TO BE STANDING HERE.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.046
HOWEVER, THERE CAN ONLY BE
ONE WINNER.

33:39.183 --> 33:40.893
[all clapping]

33:40.977 --> 33:43.604
- IT SHOWED A LOT OF INGENUITY
IN PUTTING THIS DESIGN TOGETHER

33:43.688 --> 33:45.106
AND REALLY THINKING
OUTSIDE OF THE BOX

33:45.189 --> 33:47.108
INSTEAD OF JUST DOING A BIG
COVER-UP.

33:47.191 --> 33:49.068

33:57.201 --> 34:01.956
ONE OF YOU WILL NOT BE GOING

34:02.039 --> 34:02.999
- SCOTT, WE'VE SEEN YOU DO

34:03.082 --> 34:04.333
A LOT OF REALLY GREAT TATTOOS

34:04.417 --> 34:06.294
THROUGHOUT THIS
ENTIRE COMPETITION.

34:06.377 --> 34:08.670
- WE'VE SEEN YOU TECHNICALLY
PERFORM AT A CERTAIN LEVEL,

34:08.755 --> 34:10.172
AND IT'S NEVER BACKED OFF.

34:11.924 --> 34:13.634

34:13.717 --> 34:15.803
YOU HAVE EARNED YOUR SPOT

34:20.558 --> 34:21.559
- JOB'S NOT DONE YET.

34:21.641 --> 34:23.853
I'M READY.

34:23.936 --> 34:25.938
- MATTI, HALO,

34:26.022 --> 34:27.648
THE FIGHT FOR THE LAST SPOT
AT THE LIVE FINALE

34:27.732 --> 34:31.152
IS BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

34:31.235 --> 34:33.571
- HALO, YOU'VE DEFINITELY
WOWED EVERYBODY

34:33.654 --> 34:34.989
WITH ALL OF YOUR DIFFERENT
ART SKILLS.

34:35.072 --> 34:37.324
- I FEEL LIKE
THROUGHOUT EVERYTHING,

34:37.408 --> 34:38.993
I'VE SHOWN THAT I AM VERSATILE

34:39.076 --> 34:41.411
AND I DO PUT MY ALL INTO
EVERY SINGLE TATTOO THAT I DO.

34:41.496 --> 34:44.791
BEING INK MASTER WOULD JUST BE
ANOTHER NOTCH IN THAT BELT.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.337
- MATTI, YOU BELIEVE
IN THE HEAVY BLACK.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.797
YOU BELIEVE IN A STRONG OUTLINE.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.341
YOUR WORK IS ALWAYS VERY STRONG
AND TOUGH.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.676
- I STARTED OUT FROM [bleep].

34:55.760 --> 34:58.846
TO COME FROM THERE
AND TO BE NAMED INK MASTER

34:58.930 --> 35:00.681
WOULD BE A HUGE LEAP FOR ME.

35:00.765 --> 35:01.766
I DON'T HAVE MUCH ELSE
TO FALL BACK ON.

35:01.849 --> 35:03.768
I'VE PUT ALL MY CARDS
ON THE TABLE,

35:03.851 --> 35:05.520
AND I'M ALL IN.

35:05.603 --> 35:10.066
IF YOU GUYS GAVE ME
35 HOURS AGAINST THESE GUYS,

35:10.149 --> 35:11.442
THEY SHOULD BE SCARED.

35:12.819 --> 35:14.487
- ULTIMATELY,
ONLY THREE OF YOU

35:14.570 --> 35:17.782
CAN MOVE ON TO THE LIVE FINALE.

35:17.865 --> 35:19.659
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

35:27.333 --> 35:27.375
MATTI...

35:32.964 --> 35:35.716
YOU HAVE EARNED YOUR SPOT
IN THE LIVE FINALE.

35:42.723 --> 35:44.350
- HALO.

35:44.433 --> 35:47.645
YOU DO NOT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE INK MASTER.

35:47.728 --> 35:49.897
- HALO, IT WAS A BLAST
WATCHING YOU WORK, MAN.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.148
IT'S BEEN A REAL PLEASURE FOR US

35:51.232 --> 35:52.817
TO SEE THE REAL TATTOOER
STAND UP.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.735
- I'VE SAID, "YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES

35:54.819 --> 35:57.280
TO BE INK MASTER"
ABOUT 50 TIMES,

35:57.363 --> 35:58.948
AND THIS IS THE MOST
HEART-WRENCHING TIME

35:59.031 --> 35:59.574
I'VE EVER HAD TO SAY IT.

35:59.657 --> 36:01.742
- THANKS, GUYS.

36:01.826 --> 36:04.954
THIS WAS A AWESOME,
AWESOME RUN.

36:05.037 --> 36:07.373

AND CLOSE SHOP.

36:14.255 --> 36:16.090
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,

36:22.013 --> 36:24.932
TO MEET YOUR MASTER CANVASES.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.017
- WHOO!

36:29.854 --> 36:31.689
- [sighs]

36:31.772 --> 36:32.940
I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE

36:33.024 --> 36:34.609
I SHOULD BE GOING HOME
RIGHT NOW.

36:34.692 --> 36:38.279
I HAVE NOT STOPPED PUSHING
MYSELF SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE.

36:39.989 --> 36:40.740
I STILL THINK I SHOULD BE
GOING TO THE FINALE,

36:40.823 --> 36:42.617
BUT I'M NOT.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.247
- [bleep].

36:48.331 --> 36:49.206
- HUH?

36:49.290 --> 36:50.207
- [laughs]

36:50.291 --> 36:51.292
- MATTI.
- OH, MY GOD, DUDE.

36:51.375 --> 36:51.876
- YOU DID IT, BRO.

36:51.959 --> 36:54.211
- IT'S ON.

36:54.295 --> 36:56.047
I DON'T WANT TO CELEBRATE
TOO MUCH

36:56.130 --> 36:58.174
BECAUSE THERE'S STILL SO
MUCH TO DO, DUDE, BUT, LIKE--

36:58.257 --> 37:00.051
- IT'S ALMOST LIKE WHEN YOU
CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN,

37:00.134 --> 37:01.385
YOU'RE LIKE,
"WHOO! I MADE IT!"

37:01.469 --> 37:02.803
AND THEN YOU LOOK UP THERE,
AND YOU'RE LIKE,

37:02.887 --> 37:03.930
"OH, [bleep],
THAT'S THE TOP."

37:04.013 --> 37:05.473
- SAUSAGE, WE'VE BEEN
BUTTING HEADS,

37:05.556 --> 37:07.016
BUT IT'S BECAUSE--

37:07.099 --> 37:07.934
- 'CAUSE WE WERE WORRIED
YOU WERE GONNA BE HERE.

37:08.017 --> 37:08.935
[all speaking at once]

37:27.370 --> 37:28.955
{\an8}THAT I AM GOING TO BE
INK MASTER.

37:29.038 --> 37:31.624
THERE IS NO WAY
THAT SAUSAGE AND MATTI

37:31.707 --> 37:32.875
CAN TAKE THE TITLE FROM ME.

37:32.959 --> 37:34.168
- IN THIS COMPETITION,

37:34.251 --> 37:35.419
WE'VE NEVER HAD
SUCH A TIGHT RACE.

37:35.503 --> 37:38.297
- IT'S GREAT THAT I MADE IT
TO THE FINALE,

37:38.381 --> 37:42.677
{\an8}BUT THIS JOB IS NOT OVER UNTIL
SOMEBODY WINS THAT $100,000.

WITH YOUR MASTER CANVAS

37:55.398 --> 37:56.899
TO CREATE YOUR MASTERPIECE.

37:56.983 --> 37:58.484
- AWESOME.

37:58.567 --> 37:59.568

38:00.987 --> 38:04.615
YOU MUST ALL TATTOO...

38:05.992 --> 38:07.243
A BACK PIECE.

38:08.369 --> 38:10.621
- THIS IS GONNA BE
A DAUNTING TASK.

38:10.705 --> 38:11.539
{\an8}35 HOURS IS SHORT

38:11.622 --> 38:13.332
{\an8}WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT
HOW MUCH WORK

38:13.416 --> 38:14.041
{\an8}HAS GOT TO GO INTO A BACK PIECE.
