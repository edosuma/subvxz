WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:03.160
Previously on St Elsewhere...

00:03.160 --> 00:04.880
I'm falling in love.

00:04.880 --> 00:08.039
Dr Kiem will be
Chief Surgeon
while I'm gone.

00:08.039 --> 00:10.360
One of you
mismanaged his meds.

00:10.360 --> 00:12.640
Who was
the last one here?

00:12.640 --> 00:15.120
Loyalty...
good to see. Get out!

00:15.120 --> 00:16.400
Okey-dokey.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.360
Let's get
down to business.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.360
Writing the memoirs.
Chapter one...

00:20.360 --> 00:24.200
John Doe. You spent months
finding yourself.

00:24.200 --> 00:27.120
I was drunk! You
took advantage of me.

00:27.120 --> 00:31.120
I knew
you'd hate me.

02:20.840 --> 02:24.360
I found him
slumped over his desk.

02:24.360 --> 02:28.360
Lidocaine,
100 milligrams.
One amp bicarb.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.720
I knew
this would happen.

02:31.720 --> 02:35.720
Defib. 300 watts.

02:38.920 --> 02:42.920
Clear.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.760
One amp epi
on a cardiac needle.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.280
He won't make it.

02:48.280 --> 02:52.280
Don't say that.

02:53.760 --> 02:57.760
No response.
Still in defib.

02:59.840 --> 03:00.920
Call Katherine.

03:00.920 --> 03:03.280
No, we should
keep going.

03:03.280 --> 03:07.280
Won't do any good.
We've lost him.

03:15.920 --> 03:19.920
Daniel's dead.

03:25.520 --> 03:26.560
I just heard.

03:26.560 --> 03:27.760
Too late.

03:27.760 --> 03:29.880
Late?

03:29.880 --> 03:31.080
Never.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.920
Get me a blade
and a rib spreader.

03:33.920 --> 03:37.080
I'll crack open
his chest.

03:37.080 --> 03:39.360
I'll squeeze life
into that heart.

03:39.360 --> 03:43.360
Get the hell
out of my way.

03:49.280 --> 03:53.280
No-one
will buy this.

03:54.800 --> 03:58.800
Off course again,
boy!

03:59.160 --> 04:01.480
What I need
is some fresh air.

04:01.480 --> 04:04.000
I'll drive
to the Cape.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
Naw! I'll go
to the cafeteria.

04:14.520 --> 04:18.519
Coming through.

04:19.320 --> 04:22.360
# How many years
can a people exist

04:22.360 --> 04:23.960
# before they're
allowed to be free? #

04:23.960 --> 04:25.120
Hello, Mark.

04:25.120 --> 04:26.240
# How many times

04:26.240 --> 04:27.960
# Can a man
turn his head

04:27.960 --> 04:30.680
# And pretend that
he just can't see? #

04:30.680 --> 04:33.520
Bob Dylan really
cranks out a tune.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.000
How are you feeling?

04:35.000 --> 04:36.920
# The answer,
my friend

04:36.920 --> 04:39.280
# Is blowing
in the wind

04:39.280 --> 04:42.840
# The answer is blowing
in the wind. #

04:42.840 --> 04:44.280
How's the memoirs?

04:44.280 --> 04:45.400
Going great.

04:45.400 --> 04:47.120
My chapter
on laser angiography

04:47.120 --> 04:50.200
will redefine
cardiac care
in the nineties.

04:50.200 --> 04:51.320
Sounds fascinating.

04:51.320 --> 04:54.200
But I'm thinking
faster than I'm typing.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.400
I need a secretary.

04:55.400 --> 04:56.720
They're called
assistants.

04:56.720 --> 05:00.720
Spare me. Just get me
one stat.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.200
WHISTLES

05:05.200 --> 05:08.560
Gee, a guy can't make
a subtle fashion segue

05:08.560 --> 05:10.960
without everybody
goin' into grand mal.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.360
You're as subtle
as tear gas.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.280
It's for kids
in paediatrics.

05:15.280 --> 05:18.160
Visual awareness
while I read to them.

05:18.160 --> 05:19.400
Today is Zane Grey.

05:19.400 --> 05:23.400
Can't wait to see the outfit for
Little Women.

05:33.680 --> 05:37.680
Ames Plow Tavern, 8.00.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.240
Hold up a minute.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.640
I'm crazy climbing
aboard that rocket

05:41.640 --> 05:43.120
without a skid lid.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.160
Excuse me?
A helmet.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.600
I should
know better.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.040
Your patient
died recently,

05:48.040 --> 05:49.480
a John O'Connor?

05:49.480 --> 05:51.400
Yeah. Admitted
with head trauma.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.840
Went into
cardiac arrest.

05:52.840 --> 05:55.240
I was going
through the paperwork...

05:55.240 --> 05:58.440
something I do
with first-year residents
randomly.

05:58.440 --> 06:01.360
Your charting procedure
is haphazard at best.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.760
Really?

06:02.760 --> 06:04.680
Cause of death
isn't clear.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.120
Patient information
is sketchy.

06:06.120 --> 06:07.560
You did an autopsy?
Yes.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.600
The report's
not in the file.

06:09.600 --> 06:10.920
It isn't?

06:10.920 --> 06:12.320
I asked Dr Birch...

06:12.320 --> 06:13.400
No excuses.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.360
Mr O'Connor
was your patient.

06:15.360 --> 06:18.000
It's not
another resident's
responsibility

06:18.000 --> 06:19.360
to do
the paperwork.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.800
Of course not.

06:20.800 --> 06:22.720
I'm having
this case reviewed

06:22.720 --> 06:24.040
at the conference
today.

06:24.040 --> 06:27.040
I suggest you get
that file in order.

06:27.040 --> 06:29.720
You were top pick
for the residency
programme.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.360
You have
terrific potential.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.760
But you're getting
a lousy start.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.200
I'll finish strong.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.440
Good.

06:37.440 --> 06:41.440
And stay off
motorcycles.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.120
Possible
fractured femur.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.080
She fell down
some stairs.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.520
I'll get her vitals.

06:47.520 --> 06:48.920
She's how far along?

06:48.920 --> 06:51.560
She ruptured membranes.
Must be to term, Tex.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.960
Notify neo-natal.
Get them here.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.920
I'll need
a fetal monitor.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.480
BP's 100 over 70.

06:57.480 --> 06:59.240
Ringers lactate
wide open.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.000
Start another line
normal saline.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.360
Call the blood bank.

07:02.360 --> 07:04.320
She's a
Jehovah's Witness.
No transfusions.

07:04.320 --> 07:05.720
I didn't hear that.

07:05.720 --> 07:06.760
Wayne.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.320
Three units
packed cells.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.840
It's unnecessary.
She's stable right now.

07:10.840 --> 07:13.280
Fine. We'll wait
for neo-natal.

07:13.280 --> 07:14.720
Meanwhile,
if she haemorrhages,

07:14.720 --> 07:16.560
we'll sit around
drinking beer

07:16.560 --> 07:20.560
watching her
bleed to death.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.840
It's about time.

07:26.840 --> 07:27.920
Any pulse?

07:27.920 --> 07:29.360
Can't find one.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.400
Something else
was tough to find.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.720
Don't start.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.160
We keeping you up?

07:34.160 --> 07:35.960
Defib. 300 watts.

07:35.960 --> 07:38.040
I look forward
to you

07:38.040 --> 07:40.920
whistling
the Sonata Flatline
In C-Major.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.080
300 watts.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.160
Clear.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.520
Let's go again.

07:45.520 --> 07:46.680
No kidding.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.080
Sorry I attended
your baklava blow-out.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.520
That makes two.
Ready.

07:50.520 --> 07:54.520
Clear.

07:54.920 --> 07:56.200
Start CPR.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.320
Resuscitation
mouthpiece.

07:57.320 --> 07:58.520
Don't have one.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.640
Lucy!

07:59.640 --> 08:03.640
Let's go, Victor.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.600
Aww, look
what I found...
A mouthpiece.

08:09.600 --> 08:10.720
No problem.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.520
I've had worse things
in my mouth.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.000
What a breeze.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.440
You know someday,
Donald,

08:15.440 --> 08:17.320
when you
author that play,

08:17.320 --> 08:20.240
I hope the muse
sits on your shoulder

08:20.240 --> 08:22.120
like she sits on mine.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.560
Glad to hear that.

08:23.560 --> 08:25.480
I need your help,
though.

08:25.480 --> 08:27.880
I asked Daniel
for a typist.

08:27.880 --> 08:29.320
He nods,
says, "Sure."

08:29.320 --> 08:30.760
But let's
face facts.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.320
The man's not very
effective any more.

08:33.320 --> 08:34.919
That's not true.

08:34.919 --> 08:37.400
You know how
short-handed we are.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.440
It's not fair
burdening Daniel

08:39.440 --> 08:40.840
for personal favours.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.760
I could run
my department,

08:42.760 --> 08:44.680
his department,
and your department

08:44.680 --> 08:46.200
with more efficiency.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.240
Boy!

08:47.240 --> 08:49.160
Don't expect yourself
in Chapter 14 -

08:49.160 --> 08:53.160
"Associates I admire."

08:54.600 --> 08:56.480
Are you sure
the baby's OK?

08:56.480 --> 08:58.880
As far as I can tell.

08:58.880 --> 09:00.800
There's no sign
of distress,

09:00.800 --> 09:04.280
but your fall sent you
into spontaneous labour.

09:04.280 --> 09:07.040
The stairs
in our building
are very steep.

09:07.040 --> 09:11.040
My husband's
always reminding me
to be careful.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.400
Hang on.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.320
Did you reach
my husband?

09:16.320 --> 09:18.240
Not yet,
but we're trying.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.640
Mary, your baby
is breech,

09:20.640 --> 09:24.160
which means it's
turned upside-down
in the womb.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.920
I'm performing
a caesarean section.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.520
It's all my fault.

09:27.520 --> 09:30.120
How could I
be so stupid?

09:30.120 --> 09:32.760
Your fall has nothing
to do with it.

09:32.760 --> 09:35.640
Sometimes the foetus
turns back again,

09:35.640 --> 09:38.040
but because labour's
already begun,

09:38.040 --> 09:39.960
vaginal delivery
is too dangerous

09:39.960 --> 09:43.520
for you and the baby.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.600
OK.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.960
Do it.

09:47.960 --> 09:49.920
There's one concern
I have.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.720
Should there be
any complications
during the delivery...

09:52.720 --> 09:54.280
No transfusions.

09:54.280 --> 09:57.280
We can't help
without doing
what's necessary.

09:57.280 --> 10:00.920
If I use
another's blood
orally, intravenously,

10:00.920 --> 10:03.840
Jehovah will set
his face against me.

10:03.840 --> 10:06.160
I believe
in the Scriptures too,

10:06.160 --> 10:08.560
but Matthew, Mark,
Luke, and John

10:08.560 --> 10:11.480
had no way of anticipating
today's medical progress.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.840
It's difficult
explaining my love for God.

10:13.840 --> 10:16.720
He has proven
his word to me

10:16.720 --> 10:19.120
time and time again.

10:19.120 --> 10:22.040
Shown me some things
along the way, too.

10:22.040 --> 10:26.040
My husband and I
want a large family,
Dr Turner.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.280
I can't let this,
my first child,

10:32.280 --> 10:33.880
defile
the Lord's word.

10:33.880 --> 10:37.040
I'll need you
to sign a consent form

10:37.040 --> 10:39.160
releasing St Eligius
from liability.

10:39.160 --> 10:43.160
I'll sign it,
if you promise me.

10:45.040 --> 10:49.040
You have my word.

10:49.360 --> 10:53.360
Now let's get you
to OR.

10:58.120 --> 10:59.280
Slow down.

10:59.280 --> 11:01.320
I'm late
for Klayman's
CAT scan.

11:01.320 --> 11:04.160
Westphall's gut-busting
over O'Connor's
cause of death.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.280
So?

11:05.280 --> 11:07.600
How come you're
so upset?

11:07.600 --> 11:09.960
Westphall says he
checks charts randomly.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.240
That's baloney.

11:11.240 --> 11:13.920
Novino must've
whispered something
to him last night.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.520
She was there
when O'Connor left.

11:16.520 --> 11:18.240
She knows you
administered dilantin.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.120
I did you a favour.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.720
You said,
"Push the meds in.
Don't worry."

11:22.720 --> 11:24.680
He had
a bad reaction.

11:24.680 --> 11:27.520
It's not like I shot
and robbed him.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.880
You buried
the paperwork.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.920
Also at
your suggestion.

11:30.920 --> 11:33.920
Westphall is screaming
for the autopsy report.

11:33.920 --> 11:37.120
At worst,
he can't determine
the cause of death,

11:37.120 --> 11:39.240
gives you
a little heat.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.160
Right.
Why am I wired?

11:41.160 --> 11:43.280
You're the one
Novino's after.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.280
Her word
against mine, Seth.

11:45.280 --> 11:48.160
There's no paperwork
with my signature on it...

11:48.160 --> 11:51.520
except the pharmacy log
at the nurses' station.

11:51.520 --> 11:53.440
That's it?
The only place?

11:53.440 --> 11:54.720
Yes.

11:54.720 --> 11:57.040
I'll make sure
your name
disappears.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.280
Why help me?

11:58.280 --> 12:00.240
Novino got me
in trouble.

12:00.240 --> 12:04.240
It's pay-back.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.880
'Dr Richard Morris...

12:13.880 --> 12:17.400
'Dr Richard Morris...'

12:17.400 --> 12:19.320
Ho ho ho.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.840
Looks like Cinderella
lost her magic slipper.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.760
You're a real
prince, Ehrlich.

12:24.760 --> 12:28.600
I'm bushed.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.200
I'm sorry I'm late.

12:30.200 --> 12:32.120
I'll be
right with you.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.160
Take your time.
Don't rush.

12:34.160 --> 12:38.160
With you, medicine's
always a pleasure.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.360
What?

12:43.360 --> 12:45.040
It's become
Pavlovian.

12:45.040 --> 12:47.320
You hear the voice
of authority

12:47.320 --> 12:49.440
and automatically
start brown-nosing.

12:49.440 --> 12:51.960
His head was halfway
up Kiem's gastro tract.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.840
She's had
a rough time...

12:53.840 --> 12:55.320
commuting
to Maryland,

12:55.320 --> 12:56.720
living under
Craig's shadow.

12:56.720 --> 12:58.560
I sorry for her.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.840
Take a pill.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.760
No, no, Lucy.
For once,

13:01.760 --> 13:04.400
I think Victor's
being sincere.

13:04.400 --> 13:07.720
He doesn't know
the meaning of the word.

13:07.720 --> 13:11.120
When I brought you home
from Grandma Papandro's
birthday...

13:11.120 --> 13:12.360
Back off, bunny eyes.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.680
And we jitterbugged...
Dry up, Ehrlich!

13:14.680 --> 13:18.680
My sincerity was
the last thing
you wanted to embrace.

13:20.120 --> 13:21.840
Wait. Lucy...

13:21.840 --> 13:23.840
Lucy, come on.

13:23.840 --> 13:27.840
Ladies and gentlemen...
first case.

13:36.200 --> 13:39.200
THUNDERCLAP

13:39.200 --> 13:40.320
Donald.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.240
How are you feeling?

13:42.240 --> 13:44.640
Good for someone
who'll die soon.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.080
I'm afraid so.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.360
There's one question
yet to answer.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.720
What's that?

13:49.720 --> 13:52.800
Who's going
to head-up
the hospital

13:52.800 --> 13:54.240
after I'm gone?

13:54.240 --> 13:55.920
There's
only one man

13:55.920 --> 13:57.840
who can meet
the challenge.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.720
Thank you, Daniel.
I'm honoured.

13:59.720 --> 14:03.720
Mark Craig.
Send for him.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.720
Ah...

14:05.720 --> 14:07.000
Sure.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
Let me fluff
your pillow first.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.600
I just heard.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.160
You're too late.

14:15.160 --> 14:17.320
I guess you
head the hospital.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.160
That was Daniel's wish.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.080
KNOCK ON DOOR

14:21.080 --> 14:25.080
Come on in!

14:27.840 --> 14:29.040
KNOCK AT DOOR

14:29.040 --> 14:30.120
Come on in!

14:30.120 --> 14:33.600
Mark, your prayers
are answered.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.400
I've found you
a steno, a typist.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.320
Sure you're
feeling OK, Daniel?

14:38.320 --> 14:42.320
Oh, yes...yes.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.320
Meet John Doe.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.920
Oh, for crying out loud.

14:49.920 --> 14:53.240
The man's
a walking trademark
for Looney Tunes.

14:53.240 --> 14:54.440
No offence.

14:54.440 --> 14:55.600
None taken.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.520
Dr Weiss
and I discussed
this appointment.

14:58.520 --> 15:01.360
Working with you
would be therapeutic
for John.

15:01.360 --> 15:04.280
I'm striving
to accept who I am.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.560
I'm changing
my name to Doe.

15:06.560 --> 15:09.000
Isn't he a "deer"?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.800
Donald should have
bumped you off
long ago.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.160
I'll no longer dally

15:14.160 --> 15:16.000
with other people's
personalities.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.680
I'll strive for my own...

15:17.680 --> 15:19.920
New man of strength,
independence.

15:19.920 --> 15:20.960
Shut up.

15:20.960 --> 15:23.040
You type?
90 words.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.240
A minute?

15:24.240 --> 15:25.400
Start talking.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.880
Shouldn't you sit
at the typewriter?

15:27.880 --> 15:29.200
Good idea.

15:29.200 --> 15:33.200
That's the thinking
I'm here to absorb.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.560
The intricate
inter-relationship

15:43.560 --> 15:46.440
of myocardial ischemia.

15:46.440 --> 15:48.000
Ischemia is characterised

15:48.000 --> 15:51.920
by a reduction
of myocardial ATP stores.

15:51.920 --> 15:54.440
Beta-andrenergic blockers

15:54.440 --> 15:57.840
reduce receptor-operated
channels,

15:57.840 --> 16:01.840
subsequently antagonising
myocardial calcium ion complex.

16:04.440 --> 16:05.960
Then what?

16:05.960 --> 16:07.880
You stay.
You go.

16:07.880 --> 16:11.880
Writers, you're
so temperamental.

16:13.480 --> 16:17.480
After myocardial ischemia
and subsequent reperfusion...

16:23.560 --> 16:26.320
Hi.

16:26.320 --> 16:29.600
You're in the middle
of your gastro
rotation, right?

16:29.600 --> 16:33.600
I'm having trouble
reading pancreatitis
from this upper GI.

16:35.440 --> 16:37.920
Susan?

16:37.920 --> 16:41.120
Would you help me?

16:41.120 --> 16:43.520
You've got
the wrong film up.

16:43.520 --> 16:47.520
You need the X-ray
after the patient
was given glucagon.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.240
Great outfit.

16:57.240 --> 16:59.560
I look washed-out
in pastels.

16:59.560 --> 17:03.560
You're looking for
a fashion consult too?

17:08.280 --> 17:09.960
Pancreatitis.

17:09.960 --> 17:12.200
Glucagon relaxes
the small bowel.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.079
The pancreas leaves
an impression
if it's edemitous.

17:15.079 --> 17:16.119
Is it?

17:16.119 --> 17:17.880
Don't take my word.

17:17.880 --> 17:21.880
Ask your bunky,
Westphall.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.280
How come you're mad?

17:24.280 --> 17:25.960
What have I done?

17:25.960 --> 17:27.800
I busted my butt
in medical school.
So did I.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.280
You didn't.

17:29.280 --> 17:33.280
You're here on a free ride,
and everyone knows it.

17:38.760 --> 17:40.200
Geez, I'm tired.

17:40.200 --> 17:43.120
Is it true
about you and Lucy?

17:43.120 --> 17:45.720
I have no comment.
Yes, you do, Victor.

17:45.720 --> 17:49.720
I feel catatonic.

17:51.240 --> 17:52.960
Whoa.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.920
Ha ha.
Make the joke.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.360
I've heard
them all...

17:56.360 --> 17:57.840
Giddy-up,
where's the posse.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.160
Head 'em off
at the pass.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.640
No. I like it.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.520
Where'd you
buy the duds?

18:02.520 --> 18:03.960
Schlomo's
Western World.

18:03.960 --> 18:06.360
History ignores
the Jewish cowboys'
contribution

18:06.360 --> 18:08.560
to settling the
American frontier.

18:08.560 --> 18:11.200
Blacks helped
tame the West, too.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.160
Maybe I
should go to...

18:13.160 --> 18:14.280
Schlomo's.
..Schlomo's,

18:14.280 --> 18:15.680
buy myself
some gear.

18:15.680 --> 18:19.160
Will you two
get out of here?

18:19.160 --> 18:21.320
Some things
are just private.

18:21.320 --> 18:23.960
Right, private.
Alert the media.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.560
For someone who dresses
like John Wayne spanked him,

18:25.560 --> 18:29.560
you sure have
a lot of opinions.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.320
Locked out?

18:35.320 --> 18:37.320
No. Just waiting.

18:37.320 --> 18:38.680
How's
the rehabilitation?

18:38.680 --> 18:40.080
Dexter's feeling
pretty good.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.520
And the book?

18:41.520 --> 18:44.880
I've got a madman
typing faster
than I can think.

18:44.880 --> 18:47.600
Whenever my student
nurses chomp at the bit,

18:47.600 --> 18:50.480
move with more
alacrity than
I can handle,

18:50.480 --> 18:54.480
I tell them
to take lunch.

18:58.400 --> 19:02.400
Doe! Go to lunch!

19:03.400 --> 19:05.160
Where are
we eating?

19:05.160 --> 19:09.160
Alone.

19:12.680 --> 19:16.680
Hello, Dr Craig.

19:18.720 --> 19:20.600
I wouldn't worry
about Birch.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.040
She's out of whack

19:22.040 --> 19:24.560
because she knocked
the O'Connor foul.

19:24.560 --> 19:26.880
Susan thinks
we'd turn her in?

19:26.880 --> 19:28.800
She thinks
we're the enemy.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.200
What will I say
when Westphall

19:31.200 --> 19:33.120
asks for
cause of death?

19:33.120 --> 19:35.040
The record
speaks for itself.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.480
It's not your fault.

19:36.480 --> 19:39.200
I've got to check
the pharmacy log.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.840
Mrs Wertsch
needs propranolol.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.440
Heard about
you and Victor.

19:42.440 --> 19:43.560
Who hasn't?

19:43.560 --> 19:45.400
I know what
you're experiencing.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.800
I get grief
for dating Donald.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.560
The stories I have.

19:49.560 --> 19:51.480
Already
heard them all.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.880
Funny thing about
sex and work...

19:53.880 --> 19:57.880
Sex is work,
and I'm not laughing.

19:59.280 --> 20:02.320
Scusi. I need to gander
the pharmacy log.

20:02.320 --> 20:03.640
Pleasure reading?

20:03.640 --> 20:07.640
Just making sure
nothing slipped by.

20:21.160 --> 20:23.240
Make sure I get
a copy of this page.

20:23.240 --> 20:27.240
Sure.

20:31.320 --> 20:35.320
Ehrlich?

20:35.760 --> 20:39.760
Oh.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.880
Labour and delivery
is out of your way.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.240
We need to talk.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.280
I'm finished.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.200
Make sure
the incubator's cosy.

20:49.200 --> 20:53.200
Have neo-natal ICU
standing by.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.880
I've received a complaint
from Dr Kochar.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.800
I should have gone with
Morgan as anesthesiologist.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.200
Dr Kochar
is concerned

21:01.200 --> 21:03.160
about assisting
on a surgery

21:03.160 --> 21:04.600
he considers
extremely risky.

21:04.600 --> 21:06.440
VJ is a whiner.

21:06.440 --> 21:09.360
In any case, I agree
with his assessment.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.760
Without the option
of a transfusion,

21:11.760 --> 21:14.600
surgery's too risky
for the child
and mother.

21:14.600 --> 21:16.320
I hear you, Paulette.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.960
You think I'm thrilled
to operate this way?

21:18.960 --> 21:21.800
Mary Wilson has the right
to refuse treatment.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.720
Of course,
but what about
the baby's rights?

21:24.720 --> 21:28.720
I needed another
piece of baggage
to take into that room(!)

21:29.280 --> 21:32.520
I want to be sure
you've considered everything.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.760
It's a matter
of Mary's faith.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.800
In her god.

21:36.800 --> 21:40.800
And me.

21:52.600 --> 21:56.160
I want to talk
about the hospital.

21:56.160 --> 21:58.240
Not now. I'm busy.

21:58.240 --> 22:00.680
I don't have long
to live.

22:00.680 --> 22:02.920
I want you
to succeed me.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.760
I'm...

22:04.760 --> 22:06.000
I'm...

22:06.000 --> 22:06.960
I...

22:06.960 --> 22:10.120
You OK?

22:10.120 --> 22:11.720
For Pete's sake,
Daniel.

22:11.720 --> 22:15.720
I just had that
re-upholstered.

22:18.440 --> 22:21.320
Oh, my God.

22:21.320 --> 22:22.360
No.

22:22.360 --> 22:25.640
No, no, no, no, no.

22:25.640 --> 22:29.640
No, no.

22:32.360 --> 22:35.720
Did you hear?

22:35.720 --> 22:37.000
Daniel's dead.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.120
Oh, my God.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.920
You know
what that means?

22:41.920 --> 22:43.160
Katherine's a widow?

22:43.160 --> 22:46.400
Don't be a sap!

22:46.400 --> 22:50.400
I'm Chief of Services.

22:50.960 --> 22:53.160
Try it, you're dead, too.

22:53.160 --> 22:54.440
No! No!

22:54.440 --> 22:58.440
No.

23:07.360 --> 23:10.240
Have you heard?

23:10.240 --> 23:11.440
Daniel is dead.

23:11.440 --> 23:14.000
Do you know
what that means?

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
Donald is head
of the hospital.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.200
No.

23:21.200 --> 23:25.200
You are.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
And, Dr Craig...

23:31.320 --> 23:32.760
..I've always loved you.

23:32.760 --> 23:34.680
More than Donald.

23:34.680 --> 23:38.680
I didn't know
Donald loved me.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.320
I-I can't.

23:43.320 --> 23:46.600
I'm afraid Donald
will find out how I feel.

23:46.600 --> 23:48.560
I need you to stop

23:48.560 --> 23:52.560
his consuming drive
for power so that we...

23:54.040 --> 23:56.640
I just heard...

23:56.640 --> 24:00.640
You're too late.

24:02.680 --> 24:04.680
KNOCK ON DOOR

24:04.680 --> 24:08.680
Wait a minute.

24:08.840 --> 24:11.280
Come in.

24:11.280 --> 24:12.720
Back from lunch.

24:12.720 --> 24:15.440
I had the whitefish
with hollandaise sauce,

24:15.440 --> 24:16.440
bread pudding...

24:16.440 --> 24:17.480
Who cares?

24:17.480 --> 24:19.160
Right. Of course.

24:19.160 --> 24:21.040
No more need be said.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.440
I know my place.

24:22.440 --> 24:23.600
So, uh...

24:23.600 --> 24:26.000
you've typed two
chapters already.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.400
Uh-huh.

24:28.400 --> 24:31.000
What do you think?

24:31.000 --> 24:32.040
Uh...

24:32.040 --> 24:33.200
Well, uh...

24:33.200 --> 24:34.920
What do you mean,
"Well"?

24:34.920 --> 24:37.840
Far be it from me
to criticise.

24:37.840 --> 24:39.160
You hated it.

24:39.160 --> 24:40.240
No.

24:40.240 --> 24:42.080
You love it.
No.

24:42.080 --> 24:46.080
Then what?

24:48.520 --> 24:51.880
I thought you were
penning an autobiography...

24:51.880 --> 24:54.280
Exploits from
the fascinating life

24:54.280 --> 24:57.640
of one of America's
great heart surgeons,

24:57.640 --> 25:01.640
but this reads
like a textbook.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.840
A good textbook.
I found out more

25:04.840 --> 25:06.200
about mitral valve
replacements

25:06.200 --> 25:09.000
than I wanted.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.160
Who made you the editor
of the book review?

25:12.160 --> 25:15.040
I want you
to sit down there

25:15.040 --> 25:17.640
and pound those picas.

25:17.640 --> 25:20.120
Or I'll pound you
to Topeka.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.160
Yes, sir.

25:21.160 --> 25:23.040
I didn't mean
any disrespect.

25:23.040 --> 25:25.960
Chapter three.

25:25.960 --> 25:29.080
Vasospastic angina and me.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.240
And I.

25:30.240 --> 25:32.080
Whatever.

25:32.080 --> 25:34.520
Dr Griffin, present
the next case.

25:34.520 --> 25:37.720
O'Connor, John.
51-year-old white male.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.640
Admitted
with head trauma

25:39.640 --> 25:41.280
and post-traumatic
hemiparesis.

25:41.280 --> 25:42.800
Later developed
intractable seizures.

25:42.800 --> 25:43.840
Cause of death?

25:43.840 --> 25:45.400
Cardiac arrest.

25:45.400 --> 25:48.200
That's the event.
What was the cause?

25:48.200 --> 25:49.240
Well, uh...

25:49.240 --> 25:50.520
This file's
practically empty.

25:50.520 --> 25:54.520
The few papers
I have are virtually
meaningless.

25:54.720 --> 25:57.600
Ah...the record
from the nurse's
pharmacy log

25:57.600 --> 25:59.240
shows that
the patient received

25:59.240 --> 26:02.440
300 milligrams
of dilantin IV
before the arrest.

26:02.440 --> 26:05.400
Tell us about
the injection
of that drug.

26:05.400 --> 26:07.760
A rapid injection
can lead to hypotension

26:07.760 --> 26:09.520
and depressed
myocardial function.

26:09.520 --> 26:11.000
After giving
the injection,

26:11.000 --> 26:12.400
did you monitor
the patient's vitals?

26:12.400 --> 26:14.240
No, Doctor.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.400
Why?
Well, actually...

26:16.400 --> 26:19.720
It says here that the dilantin
was administered by Dr Birch.

26:19.720 --> 26:23.720
Susan, can you
enlighten us?

26:24.400 --> 26:28.280
I, uh...

26:28.280 --> 26:29.720
Dr Griffin was busy.

26:29.720 --> 26:32.640
He asked me to give
the injection.

26:32.640 --> 26:35.200
Are you aware
of the hospital
procedure

26:35.200 --> 26:36.720
for administering
dilantin?

26:36.720 --> 26:39.280
Of course.
20 milligrams a minute.

26:39.280 --> 26:41.640
I took
Mr O'Connor's BP.

26:41.640 --> 26:43.360
He showed no
adverse signs.

26:43.360 --> 26:45.320
What about
the autopsy report?

26:45.320 --> 26:46.800
Well, we
looked everywhere,

26:46.800 --> 26:49.840
and apparently,
it was misplaced, but...

26:49.840 --> 26:53.840
The log indicates
you signed out
the meds at 6.55am.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.240
What time
did O'Connor code?

26:56.240 --> 26:57.720
7.15...7.20.

26:57.720 --> 27:01.720
No.

27:01.840 --> 27:03.600
He coded
at 7.00am.

27:03.600 --> 27:05.480
To properly administer
300 milligrams

27:05.480 --> 27:07.760
should have taken
another 10 minutes.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.640
She's wrong
about the time.

27:09.640 --> 27:11.120
I think she's right.

27:11.120 --> 27:14.560
Remember, you
passed me in the hall.

27:14.560 --> 27:17.040
You were going to eat,

27:17.040 --> 27:19.080
but said you'd
do me the favour.

27:19.080 --> 27:23.080
Dr Novino, how are you
involved with this?

27:26.200 --> 27:27.240
I was there when...

27:27.240 --> 27:31.240
What? When I murdered
the guy?

27:32.040 --> 27:34.440
I'm not exactly sure
what happened.

27:34.440 --> 27:35.880
Dr Auschlander and I

27:35.880 --> 27:38.320
will see you three later.

27:38.320 --> 27:41.920
The next case, please.

27:41.920 --> 27:44.880
The patient's name
is Marge Greenhut...

27:44.880 --> 27:48.880
Number three blade.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.600
I'm completing a transverse
incision in the uterus.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.000
Hopefully, there'll
be less blood loss.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.880
I read that
Michael Jackson's
a Jehovah's Witness.

27:57.880 --> 28:00.280
Hard to imagine him
passing out The Watchtower.

28:00.280 --> 28:04.160
Article says he even
does door-to-door
fancy footwork.

28:04.160 --> 28:08.160
How many people say,
"Beat it"?

28:12.720 --> 28:13.800
Dr Turner.

28:13.800 --> 28:17.080
I've got four units
of O+ blood.
I didn't order that.

28:17.080 --> 28:18.600
Dr Kiem did.

28:18.600 --> 28:21.080
Return it.

28:21.080 --> 28:23.800
Retractor.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.920
Help me with
fundal pressure.

28:25.920 --> 28:28.240
Dr Kiem speaks
very good English.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.520
She wants
this blood here.

28:30.520 --> 28:31.960
Somebody's got to sign.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.840
Get him off my back.

28:33.840 --> 28:37.840
VJ, this was
your idea.

28:40.040 --> 28:42.000
Back pull
on the retractor.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.920
Hang on. The cord's
wrapped around his neck.

28:44.920 --> 28:47.760
Here's the head.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.680
Clamped
and clipped.

28:49.680 --> 28:53.680
You're as big
as a butterball turkey.

28:58.360 --> 29:00.080
Sing for me.

29:00.080 --> 29:02.440
How's Mary doing?

29:02.440 --> 29:05.160
BP'S 80 over 62
and dropping.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.920
Jackie,
massage the fundus.

29:06.920 --> 29:09.000
We have to expel
the placenta.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.560
I'll stop the bleeding.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.480
The placenta's
giving me trouble.

29:13.480 --> 29:15.120
She must have
an acretia.

29:15.120 --> 29:17.520
Blood pressure's
still falling.

29:17.520 --> 29:21.520
Come on, Mary.
Your baby needs a mama.

29:24.200 --> 29:26.160
Oooh!

29:26.160 --> 29:27.560
Mm-hmm.
Just arrived.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.400
Delivery man said
they're yours.

29:29.400 --> 29:32.200
For me?

29:32.200 --> 29:35.720
Oh, well, I've never
gotten flowers before.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.480
Hey, there's no card.

29:37.480 --> 29:40.040
Must be from Victor.

29:40.040 --> 29:41.320
Oh.

29:41.320 --> 29:42.560
Exploding bouquet?

29:42.560 --> 29:44.840
Maybe it's his way
of apologising.

29:44.840 --> 29:48.440
Victor's a...
He's got a good heart.

29:48.440 --> 29:50.120
I've been sneered at

29:50.120 --> 29:52.840
by every white coat
in this hospital.

29:52.840 --> 29:54.720
He shouldn't have
said anything.

29:54.720 --> 29:56.320
You've a short fuse.

29:56.320 --> 30:00.320
You chew him up
in front of everybody.

30:01.160 --> 30:04.720
At least he's trying
to make it up to you.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.360
Anyways, Mr Heinsbergen
in 3016's febrile again.

30:07.360 --> 30:09.760
Restrict him
to ice chips.

30:09.760 --> 30:11.200
He didn't cheap-out

30:11.200 --> 30:15.200
on the floral
arrangement.

30:19.160 --> 30:23.160
I don't expect
special treatment.
That's right.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.120
Why didn't you
tell me

30:25.120 --> 30:26.560
about
the O'Connor case?

30:26.560 --> 30:29.400
I didn't actually see Birch
give the injection.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.320
A man
may have died

30:31.320 --> 30:33.240
because of
a physician's
negligence.

30:33.240 --> 30:36.120
Because we're dating,
I'm your secret police?

30:36.120 --> 30:37.600
Hard enough fitting in.

30:37.600 --> 30:40.440
I'm eight years older
than most of them.

30:40.440 --> 30:43.240
Without their support,
I'd be doomed around here.

30:43.240 --> 30:45.720
Most important
of all, Dr Novino,

30:45.720 --> 30:47.080
is the patient.

30:47.080 --> 30:51.080
It's not my place
to blow the whistle.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.840
How many people
have to be killed

30:54.840 --> 30:58.840
before
it's your place?

30:59.320 --> 31:00.600
That's all, Dr Novino.

31:00.600 --> 31:04.600
Please send Dr Griffin in.

31:15.840 --> 31:18.080
I feel bad
about this.

31:18.080 --> 31:22.080
Sit down.

31:22.520 --> 31:24.480
THUNDERCLAP

31:24.480 --> 31:26.440
The uterus
is still bleeding.

31:26.440 --> 31:29.200
She's lost
an awful lot of blood.

31:29.200 --> 31:31.080
BP'S 68 over 40.

31:31.080 --> 31:33.080
The placenta's
not separating.

31:33.080 --> 31:34.880
Pulse has
dropped to 80.

31:34.880 --> 31:36.360
She's in trouble.

31:36.360 --> 31:37.800
I know!

31:37.800 --> 31:41.800
We still have four units
O+ on hold.

31:48.320 --> 31:49.760
I have two choices.

31:49.760 --> 31:53.760
Perform a hysterectomy
and stop the bleeding...

31:54.560 --> 31:58.560
..or break my word
and give Mary blood.

32:01.280 --> 32:03.520
Turn the saline wide open.

32:03.520 --> 32:05.480
That won't
help her, Roxanne.

32:05.480 --> 32:09.480
She's lost half
her blood volume.

32:12.960 --> 32:16.960
I have no choice.

32:19.240 --> 32:20.680
Mark, you're back?

32:20.680 --> 32:22.120
I forgot
my umbrella.

32:22.120 --> 32:25.040
Be careful.
Dangerous night out.

32:25.040 --> 32:29.040
I wonder what
she meant by that.

32:30.080 --> 32:32.000
'This treatment must
be continued...'

32:32.000 --> 32:35.120
Oh, my God,
he's dead.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.000
Doe.
Hey, Doe!

32:37.000 --> 32:38.040
Huh?

32:38.040 --> 32:39.080
Huh?
Oh!

32:39.080 --> 32:40.960
Oh, I'm sorry, Doctor.

32:40.960 --> 32:43.320
Really held
your interest,
didn't it?

32:43.320 --> 32:46.200
I started drifting off
during the Penn years.

32:46.200 --> 32:49.160
The whole thing
is boring.

32:49.160 --> 32:50.920
Not at all, Doctor.

32:50.920 --> 32:53.640
That stuff about
atrioventricular
node disease

32:53.640 --> 32:54.960
made me chortle.

32:54.960 --> 32:57.880
I try writing
about my life
truthfully,

32:57.880 --> 33:00.560
and it's a snore,
even to me.

33:00.560 --> 33:03.880
I fictionalise
and it becomes cheap.

33:03.880 --> 33:06.320
I'm wasting my time
and yours,

33:06.320 --> 33:07.760
if that's possible.

33:07.760 --> 33:11.760
Why I ever thought
I could write
is beyond me.

33:12.040 --> 33:14.400
People said it
would be easy.

33:14.400 --> 33:18.280
You know, a verb,
a noun, sprinkle in
some adjectives.

33:18.280 --> 33:20.160
Write what you know.

33:20.160 --> 33:23.080
Ha. I mean, to take
a personal event

33:23.080 --> 33:25.960
and have the guts
to expose yourself

33:25.960 --> 33:27.360
in front
of millions.

33:27.360 --> 33:30.120
Then to have
that event touch
their lives...

33:30.120 --> 33:31.160
Shh!

33:31.160 --> 33:32.680
Don't shush me.

33:32.680 --> 33:35.320
We're on to something.
You're crazy.

33:35.320 --> 33:37.320
Be that as it may,

33:37.320 --> 33:39.880
if you can keep
shovelling out
this trash,

33:39.880 --> 33:41.520
we've got
a best-seller.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.240
This is gold.

33:43.240 --> 33:44.800
Yeah?

33:44.800 --> 33:46.240
Mm-hmm.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.680
Yeah. All right.

33:48.680 --> 33:50.120
I'm damn good.

33:50.120 --> 33:53.200
Take this down.

33:53.200 --> 33:57.200
Her shapely legs
straddled my gurney.

33:59.400 --> 34:02.280
Sure,
I'm a surgeon...

34:02.280 --> 34:04.680
..and a great one
at that,

34:04.680 --> 34:06.600
but I knew...

34:06.600 --> 34:10.600
that showing
this babe how
to operate...

34:11.880 --> 34:15.880
..would take more
than a tank
of nitrous.

34:27.120 --> 34:28.159
Oh, Lucy.

34:28.159 --> 34:31.040
You scared
the bejeepers out of me.

34:31.040 --> 34:33.080
Ehrlich, it's time
for a talk.

34:33.080 --> 34:36.480
Ahh, yep.

34:36.480 --> 34:37.520
Ahh.

34:37.520 --> 34:41.199
Sitting duck. Fire away.

34:41.199 --> 34:44.600
I liked it.

34:44.600 --> 34:46.679
I liked the sex.

34:46.679 --> 34:49.280
Pinch me. I must
be dreaming.

34:49.280 --> 34:50.560
Ow!

34:50.560 --> 34:54.560
Sit there and listen.

34:56.920 --> 34:58.360
We were pretty
good together.

34:58.360 --> 35:00.800
But something
about that
scared me.

35:00.800 --> 35:04.160
I haven't been
close to a man
for a...

35:04.160 --> 35:06.560
Well,
for a long time.

35:06.560 --> 35:08.360
I was freaked out that
you were the one.

35:08.360 --> 35:12.360
Me too.

35:12.480 --> 35:13.920
Oh!

35:13.920 --> 35:17.920
Sorry.

35:19.240 --> 35:21.880
Listen, I've been
terrible to you

35:21.880 --> 35:24.040
ever since
we slept together.
Oh...

35:24.040 --> 35:28.040
It's not as if we ever got along
in the first place.

35:28.120 --> 35:29.960
Except like you said.

35:29.960 --> 35:32.880
Or that time that
we operated together

35:32.880 --> 35:36.720
during
the nurses' strike.

35:36.720 --> 35:37.880
HUMMING

35:37.880 --> 35:39.240
Ahem.

35:39.240 --> 35:40.720
Oh.

35:40.720 --> 35:44.720
Sorry.

35:46.320 --> 35:48.200
Listen...

35:48.200 --> 35:51.120
What I'm trying
to say is, I...

35:51.120 --> 35:53.960
Well, I know
we could work
well together,

35:53.960 --> 35:55.720
regardless
of the friction.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.800
There's always
a little chafing.

35:57.800 --> 36:00.640
Yeah, we shouldn't
let it affect
our performance.

36:00.640 --> 36:01.880
No, indeed-y.

36:01.880 --> 36:05.880
Where would you
like to perform next?

36:07.280 --> 36:08.320
Well...

36:08.320 --> 36:12.320
Here, in-in
the hospital.

36:13.080 --> 36:17.080
Fine and dandy.

36:20.440 --> 36:24.440
Don't mind me.

36:25.480 --> 36:27.040
You sent me
flowers

36:27.040 --> 36:29.080
so you could
hit on me?

36:29.080 --> 36:31.480
You said we worked
well together.

36:31.480 --> 36:34.160
I didn't mean
that way!

36:34.160 --> 36:38.160
I meant we
should be civil
to each other.

36:41.120 --> 36:42.440
Bad move.

36:42.440 --> 36:45.160
When she said flowers,
you should have said,
"You're welcome."

36:45.160 --> 36:46.800
Oh!

36:46.800 --> 36:50.800
Here's the receipt
from the florist.

37:02.760 --> 37:06.760
Jehovah has made me
very happy, Dr Turner.

37:07.040 --> 37:08.560
What will
you name him?

37:08.560 --> 37:11.080
John Andrew Wilson.

37:11.080 --> 37:13.120
That's a handsome name.

37:13.120 --> 37:17.120
John means
"God is gracious".

37:17.960 --> 37:21.960
Mary, I just had
a talk with your husband.

37:21.960 --> 37:25.200
There were some complications
after the delivery.

37:25.200 --> 37:27.240
Your uterus
wouldn't contract.

37:27.240 --> 37:30.360
I did everything
I could, Mary.

37:30.360 --> 37:34.360
I'm afraid...

37:35.680 --> 37:36.800
Yes?

37:36.800 --> 37:40.800
There was
excessive blood loss.

37:41.440 --> 37:42.880
Your pressure dropped.

37:42.880 --> 37:46.480
I was forced to make
a very difficult decision.

37:46.480 --> 37:49.080
You promised
you wouldn't
give me blood.

37:49.080 --> 37:52.160
I didn't.

37:52.160 --> 37:54.320
I performed
a hysterectomy.

37:54.320 --> 37:57.680
Please understand
I had no other option.

37:57.680 --> 38:01.680
You would have
lost your life.

38:02.880 --> 38:05.160
Then John will be
my one and only?

38:05.160 --> 38:08.320
Yes.

38:08.320 --> 38:11.760
The judicial decisions
of Jehovah are true.

38:11.760 --> 38:13.800
They have proven
themselves

38:13.800 --> 38:15.600
altogether righteous.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.520
In the keeping
of them,

38:17.520 --> 38:20.160
theirs is
a large reward.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.080
I've already
received eight pounds

38:22.080 --> 38:26.080
of my reward
here and now.

38:27.640 --> 38:31.640
God truly
is gracious,
Dr Turner.

38:32.400 --> 38:36.400
Thank you.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.280
Lucy?

38:44.280 --> 38:45.720
CRYING

38:45.720 --> 38:49.720
Are you...

38:52.920 --> 38:56.640
I've never seen
this side of you.

38:56.640 --> 38:58.720
Vulnerable,
sensitive,

38:58.720 --> 39:01.160
pathetic.

39:01.160 --> 39:04.080
Sorry I tried putting
the squeeze on you.

39:04.080 --> 39:05.480
It's not your fault.

39:05.480 --> 39:09.480
I'm real good at giving
people the wrong idea.

39:09.560 --> 39:10.760
We all do that.

39:10.760 --> 39:11.800
You don't.

39:11.800 --> 39:14.600
You're up front
about being an...

39:14.600 --> 39:17.360
An oinkster. I know.

39:17.360 --> 39:19.800
You show your
uncertainty,
your insecurity.

39:19.800 --> 39:23.800
I just shut out
everyone before
they can get close.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.200
You have
that other side.

39:26.200 --> 39:28.160
At your grandmother's
birthday party,

39:28.160 --> 39:30.040
you were willing
to have spontaneity

39:30.040 --> 39:31.520
thrust on you.

39:31.520 --> 39:34.400
We're here because of
your heat-seeking libido.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.160
Look how
that backfired.

39:36.160 --> 39:37.600
I didn't touch that.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.560
I never intended
to breathe a word,

39:39.560 --> 39:41.880
but since
I struck midnight
in a clam barrel,

39:41.880 --> 39:43.520
you've slapped me silly.

39:43.520 --> 39:47.080
I took it because
I understood your pain.

39:47.080 --> 39:51.080
But this morning,
you just pushed
too hard.

39:51.560 --> 39:55.560
I'm sorry.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.080
Well, me, too.

39:58.080 --> 40:02.080
About spilling
the beans,
not the seeds.

40:05.280 --> 40:09.120
Thanks, Victor.

40:09.120 --> 40:13.120
Anytime, anyplace.

40:16.720 --> 40:19.200
Let's, uh...

40:19.200 --> 40:21.120
Let's quit
while we're ahead.

40:21.120 --> 40:23.000
Yeah.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.320
Yeah.

40:26.320 --> 40:30.320
Yeah.

40:43.560 --> 40:47.560
Takes two weeks to get
your severance pay.

40:47.680 --> 40:50.520
Red roses
for a blue lady.

40:50.520 --> 40:51.840
No, thanks.

40:51.840 --> 40:54.360
I still think Auschlander
and Westphall

40:54.360 --> 40:56.240
gave you a bum deal,

40:56.240 --> 40:58.640
suspending you from
the residency programme.

40:58.640 --> 41:00.080
What can I do?

41:00.080 --> 41:02.960
They kept me
in there for an hour.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.800
I got to write out
patient forms

41:05.800 --> 41:07.920
for the last two years.

41:07.920 --> 41:10.560
I have to turn in
my name tag.

41:10.560 --> 41:11.680
Where are you going?

41:11.680 --> 41:14.000
Right now,
back to Wisconsin.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.840
Love the fall there.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.320
The suspension's
not forever.

41:17.320 --> 41:18.880
You'll gut the time.

41:18.880 --> 41:21.400
You said we'd
stick together.

41:21.400 --> 41:22.800
Why stab me, Seth?

41:22.800 --> 41:25.720
I want to be
a doctor so badly,

41:25.720 --> 41:29.720
I get scared.

41:31.400 --> 41:34.240
The way they run
their stupid hospital.

41:34.240 --> 41:36.640
I'd been up three
days straight.

41:36.640 --> 41:39.040
Exhaustion doesn't make
a better doctor.

41:39.040 --> 41:41.920
The system makes us
think of ourselves first.

41:41.920 --> 41:45.800
In order to help people,
I have to be selfish.

41:45.800 --> 41:48.200
I'm sorry
you took the fall

41:48.200 --> 41:52.200
because
I really like you.

42:00.640 --> 42:03.160
None of this would
have happened

42:03.160 --> 42:07.160
if you hadn't
killed the guy.

42:08.800 --> 42:10.200
Watch out, Seth,

42:10.200 --> 42:13.600
because some day
when you've forgotten
how you ruined me,

42:13.600 --> 42:17.600
I'm going to get you.

42:43.400 --> 42:45.120
You OK?

42:45.120 --> 42:49.040
Not really.

42:49.040 --> 42:51.960
I spoke to Dr Kochar
about the surgery.

42:51.960 --> 42:54.800
That guy gets around.

42:54.800 --> 42:57.720
It's kind of you
not to say

42:57.720 --> 42:59.320
I told you so.

42:59.320 --> 43:01.840
Were you raised
in a faith?

43:01.840 --> 43:05.840
In Vietnam, my parents
were subjected to persecution.

43:07.080 --> 43:09.480
It taught me to be careful,

43:09.480 --> 43:12.200
keep up with the latest dogma.

43:12.200 --> 43:16.200
Each ruling nation
imposed its own religion.

43:17.200 --> 43:21.200
The French with their
Catholic missionary and the...

43:22.160 --> 43:26.160
..British Anglican...

43:27.120 --> 43:29.280
I learned to observe,

43:29.280 --> 43:31.640
but never to believe.

43:31.640 --> 43:35.600
No constants?

43:35.600 --> 43:38.600
Nothing dependable?

43:38.600 --> 43:41.800
Except the war god.

43:41.800 --> 43:45.800
I was raised Baptist.

43:46.280 --> 43:50.280
Where I grew up,
my world revolved
around the church,

43:50.440 --> 43:54.440
singing in the choirs,
and Sunday suppers.

43:56.680 --> 44:00.680
When her placenta
wouldn't separate...

44:01.800 --> 44:04.240
..I couldn't stop
the haemorrhaging.

44:04.240 --> 44:06.760
I had the power
to determine

44:06.760 --> 44:10.760
whether a woman could
give birth again.

44:12.520 --> 44:16.320
In that moment,
I had blood
on my hands,

44:16.320 --> 44:19.520
I thought about
the blood...

44:19.520 --> 44:23.520
..and its
extraordinary function.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.400
You did
the best you could

44:26.400 --> 44:30.400
in a no-win situation.

44:30.400 --> 44:33.280
What kind of power
is there in knowing...

44:33.280 --> 44:36.480
you can destroy trust?

44:36.480 --> 44:40.320
You can break your word.

44:40.320 --> 44:43.200
And yet you worship
a higher mind

44:43.200 --> 44:47.040
who wields
its force arbitrarily.

44:47.040 --> 44:49.880
Where was your god
when you needed him?

44:49.880 --> 44:53.240
He was right there with me
all along, Paulette.

44:53.240 --> 44:54.440
I felt him.

44:54.440 --> 45:39.000
I felt him kick my butt!
