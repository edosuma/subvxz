That's our show.

01:16.570 --> 01:18.340
Didn't <i>Shake It Up</i> enough?

01:18.370 --> 01:19.600
You can shake it up again Thursday

01:28.580 --> 01:30.480
Oh, isn't it obvious?

01:30.520 --> 01:32.380
So, what time should
Gunther and I be there?

01:32.420 --> 01:35.290
Oh! Keeping in mind I
need an hour for makeup.

01:35.320 --> 01:37.390
And I need an hour and a half for hair.

01:39.420 --> 01:41.630
What? This doesn't
just happen, people.

01:43.660 --> 01:47.460
Yeah, and neither does you and Tinka being
chosen for <i>Good Morning Chicago.</i>

01:47.500 --> 01:50.400
Yes, he said the best dancers.
Not the most delusional.

01:51.740 --> 01:53.540
It's not Gunther and Tinka.

01:53.570 --> 01:55.340
Ha! In your face!

01:55.370 --> 01:56.640
The winners are CeCe...
I knew it!

01:56.680 --> 01:58.540
And Gunther!
I didn't know that.

02:03.680 --> 02:05.320
What did she just say?

02:05.350 --> 02:07.420
You know, I don't feel
comfortable repeating it

02:07.450 --> 02:09.320

02:09.350 --> 02:12.460

do with the horse you rode in on.

I'm happy for you.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.470

04:03.500 --> 04:06.200
But we're not connected at the hip.

I'm going to cheer you on and later

04:57.520 --> 04:59.590
Maybe you're not as petty as I am,

04:59.620 --> 05:01.430
but you have potential.

05:16.110 --> 05:19.280

07:00.610 --> 07:04.410
Oh, come on! Who raps about
getting a good deal on a haircut?

07:04.450 --> 07:06.350
Someone who enjoys saving for college

07:06.380 --> 07:08.450
and wants to keep it real at the same time.

07:10.090 --> 07:11.490
Rap is supposed to be edgy.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.420
It's about hardship and struggle.

07:13.460 --> 07:16.130
The only struggle with your
rap was listening to it.

07:17.130 --> 07:18.160
Hey!

07:18.200 --> 07:21.100
Don't worry, I can help.
Give me all your cash.

07:21.130 --> 07:24.400
Then I won't have any money and I'm hungry.

07:24.440 --> 07:26.170
Broke and hungry?

07:26.200 --> 07:29.110
Sounds like the title of your first album.

07:29.140 --> 07:30.240
You're welcome.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.390
Oh, that's right, mine!

08:49.490 --> 08:51.250

08:51.290 --> 08:54.060
you're also getting
this week's spotlight dance.

08:54.090 --> 08:56.060
Oh! Yes! That's so awesome...
Hang on.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.430
Uh, Rocky, are you okay with this?

09:00.470 --> 09:02.400
Because if you're not I'll go tell Gary...
Please! Please!

09:02.430 --> 09:05.070
I am thrilled that you're
getting the spotlight dance!

09:05.100 --> 09:06.370
Okay? In fact,

09:06.400 --> 09:09.010
they should put a spotlight on me right now

09:09.040 --> 09:11.980
to show everyone how excited I am for you!

09:12.010 --> 09:13.380
You know, 'cause
I'm excited! Whoo!

09:13.410 --> 09:17.180
So how about you go over there,
and I'll be right back.

09:25.160 --> 09:29.390
Envy, party of one.
Your table is ready.

09:29.430 --> 09:32.260
Why can't I be on the morning
show and get a Spotlight Dance?

09:32.300 --> 09:34.500
It's not fair!
It should be me!

09:38.070 --> 09:40.000
Can I just say,

09:40.040 --> 09:45.180
this is the first time I almost
sort of kind of liked you.

09:45.210 --> 09:47.310
Now here is what we are going to do.

09:48.210 --> 09:49.350
What is that?

09:49.380 --> 09:53.150
A flu-infected tissue,
courtesy of Randy Himmelfarb.

09:53.180 --> 09:56.320
It's full of his sickness,
which we can spread to CeCe,

09:56.350 --> 09:59.060
rendering her unable to dance.

09:59.090 --> 10:00.320
More than usual.

10:01.460 --> 10:04.260
That's a great plan.
Oh, I can't wait to...

10:04.300 --> 10:06.360
What am I saying?

10:06.400 --> 10:08.270
You know what?
I'm just going to do the mature thing

10:08.300 --> 10:10.070
and talk to CeCe about my feelings.

10:10.100 --> 10:13.140
Mature conversation with CeCe?

10:13.170 --> 10:15.440
Text me when you're ready
for operation snot rag.

10:29.290 --> 10:32.490
Okay, Ty, if you want
to be a successful rapper,

10:32.520 --> 10:36.260
you've got to get rid of that
squeaky-clean, goody-two-shoes image.

10:36.290 --> 10:38.130
You need a reputation.

10:38.160 --> 10:39.430
I do have a reputation.

10:39.460 --> 10:41.260
No cavities five years in a row.

10:41.300 --> 10:43.170
Can I get a what-what!

10:45.100 --> 10:46.270
No.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.270
But you can get
a "who cares."

10:51.180 --> 10:53.380
Trust me, this is the perfect plan.

10:53.410 --> 10:56.110
Everyone's going to be
talking about the day

10:56.150 --> 10:57.480
Ty Blue stole a pizza.

10:57.520 --> 10:59.320
Uh-huh.
Hands in.

10:59.350 --> 11:00.420
One, two, three.

11:00.450 --> 11:02.320
Bam!

11:02.350 --> 11:04.190
Let's do this.

11:07.260 --> 11:10.260
I'm taking this pizza!

11:10.290 --> 11:13.330
Ty Blue's stealing a pizza!

11:16.030 --> 11:17.430
You didn't pay for that!

11:17.470 --> 11:21.240
I'm calling the police!

11:21.270 --> 11:23.410
Go ahead!
I'm not afraid of the cops!

11:23.440 --> 11:25.180

11:25.210 --> 11:26.380
No. No.

11:30.350 --> 11:33.480

11:33.520 --> 11:35.390
I'm not afraid of no authority.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.390
Yo, bro, you dropped your purse!

11:39.420 --> 11:44.490
Oh! Thank you!
That thief tried to steal my purse.

11:44.530 --> 11:46.300
What's your name, son?

11:46.330 --> 11:47.500
Ty Blue.

11:47.530 --> 11:52.240
Well, there's a butterscotch
in here for you

11:52.270 --> 11:55.310
because Ty Blue is a hero!

11:55.340 --> 12:00.110
No, I'm not a hero!
I'm a bad boy.

12:00.140 --> 12:04.450
Well, you're the sweetest
bad boy I've ever seen.

12:04.480 --> 12:06.420

12:06.450 --> 12:08.290

12:16.390 --> 12:19.060
So that's it. I mean,
I am so embarrassed.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.400
I admit it. I was jealous.

12:20.430 --> 12:23.300
What kind of terrible person is
jealous of their best friend?

12:23.330 --> 12:25.170
Me!

12:25.200 --> 12:27.470
Rocky, I'm jealous of you all the time.

12:27.510 --> 12:31.240
Your good grades,
your amazing sense of style,

12:31.280 --> 12:34.040
your ability to reach
things on high shelves.

12:35.050 --> 12:36.310
You forgot my smile, my creativity,

12:36.350 --> 12:38.080
my ability to forgive you

12:38.120 --> 12:40.250
for making jokes about me
being freakishly tall.

12:42.490 --> 12:45.020
Thanks for making me feel better.

12:45.060 --> 12:46.660
You're welcome.

12:46.690 --> 12:49.330
All right. Now, let me show you the dress
I got for <i>Good Morning Chicago.</i>

12:50.490 --> 12:53.060
Time to be jealous again!

12:53.100 --> 12:54.300
Oh, my gosh! I hate you!

12:54.330 --> 12:56.330
Thank you!

12:56.370 --> 12:58.300
Oh, your highlights are done.
Okay.

13:00.100 --> 13:01.670
Thank you again for doing them for me.

13:01.710 --> 13:05.280
Of course! I want you to look extra
special for <i>Good Morning Chicago.</i>

13:06.210 --> 13:07.380
Ooh, ooh, careful.

13:12.050 --> 13:13.350
Wait, what's wrong?

13:16.150 --> 13:21.060
It's red, it's green, it's red, it's green...
It's horrible!

13:21.090 --> 13:24.190
I look like Christmas threw up on my head.

13:24.230 --> 13:26.360
Rocky, how could you do this to me?

13:26.400 --> 13:29.000
Uh, it wasn't me.

13:29.030 --> 13:32.070
It was Tinka!
She's out there, the fire escape!

13:36.310 --> 13:39.240
I don't see her.

13:39.280 --> 13:42.410
She was just there a second ago!
And she had green hair dye!

13:42.450 --> 13:46.320
You know what, Rocky?
It's one thing to be a little jealous.

13:46.350 --> 13:48.450
It's another to sabotage your best friend.

13:49.450 --> 13:51.520
She's back!
She's right there!

13:53.260 --> 13:56.490
Oh, please, Rocky.
I may not be a valamictorium,

13:56.530 --> 13:58.160
but I'm not an idiot!

14:10.590 --> 14:13.320
I think it looks cute.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.330
Knowing you, you'll start a trend

14:15.360 --> 14:18.400
and every girl in school will
want to wear their hair that way.

14:18.430 --> 14:20.300
Yeah, they'll all wish they were me.

14:20.330 --> 14:23.370
CeCe, the sea monster.

14:23.400 --> 14:26.600
Okay, look, how many times do
I have to tell you I'm sorry?

14:26.640 --> 14:28.640
Once, Rocky. Once!

14:28.670 --> 14:30.510
You keep blaming it on Tinka.

14:30.540 --> 14:33.240
Because she did it.
I swear!

14:33.280 --> 14:34.480
Oh, okay. Fine.

14:34.510 --> 14:37.450
Tinka magically appears and disappears

14:37.480 --> 14:39.480
and does bad things to me.

14:40.550 --> 14:43.350
I believe you.
Thank you.

14:43.390 --> 14:45.590
Wait, you're being sarcastic, aren't you?

14:45.620 --> 14:48.460
No!

14:48.490 --> 14:50.190
You know what?
If you're so jealous

14:50.230 --> 14:52.200
that you don't want me to be on
<i>Good Morning Chicago,</i>

14:52.230 --> 14:53.430
just say so.

15:01.610 --> 15:05.480
Okay, if you can't actually
commit a crime, how about this?

15:05.510 --> 15:08.180
We read the newspaper
and find an unsolved case.

15:08.210 --> 15:09.280
You confess.

15:09.310 --> 15:11.450
Nothing too violent, maybe a bank robbery.

15:12.650 --> 15:14.490
You'll go to prison for 25 to life,

15:14.520 --> 15:18.320
and knowing you, you'll be
out in 18 for good behavior.

15:18.360 --> 15:20.290
People will still know
what a b dude you are

15:20.330 --> 15:22.630
because it'll be tattooed on your face.

15:24.530 --> 15:27.470
Then you just gotta make some
rhymes and you'll be on your way.

15:29.570 --> 15:33.540
Or we can keep spitballing.

15:33.570 --> 15:36.310
What if you released an animal
from its cage at the zoo?

15:36.340 --> 15:38.580
It'll get you tons of attention.

15:38.610 --> 15:41.510
Oh, I know!
You can release the lions.

15:41.550 --> 15:45.350
Oh. Okay, okay.
I like where you're going.

15:45.380 --> 15:48.220
But you know what also could work?

15:48.250 --> 15:49.350
Penguins!

15:51.390 --> 15:53.620
Do penguins sound dangerous to you?

15:53.660 --> 15:56.630
Because there is a reason the
movie was call <i>Happy Feet</i>

15:56.660 --> 15:59.530
and not <i>Scary Feet.</i>

15:59.570 --> 16:02.330
Fine. Then what's in between
lions and penguins, then?

16:02.370 --> 16:05.570
Uh, if I recall, there's a men's
bathroom and a churro cart.

16:09.140 --> 16:11.540
What, am I the only one
who's been to the zoo before?

16:21.150 --> 16:23.520
Uh, delivery for CeCe Jones.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.590
Wow, look at that.
They're amazing.

16:26.630 --> 16:28.330
Who died?

16:30.330 --> 16:31.630
Oh, that's right.

16:31.660 --> 16:34.500
In this country, balloons are
used for celebratory purposes.

16:36.570 --> 16:37.570
There's a card.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.540
"I may not be with you on the dance floor,

16:42.570 --> 16:46.310
"but I'm always on your side.
Love, Rocky."

16:46.350 --> 16:48.350
Aw!

16:48.380 --> 16:50.180
I wish she was here right now.

16:50.220 --> 16:51.580
I would give her the biggest hug.

16:55.220 --> 16:56.250
Aw!

16:56.290 --> 16:57.290
Rocky!

17:07.400 --> 17:08.400
You know what, Rocky?

17:09.500 --> 17:11.300
I'm really glad you're here.

17:11.339 --> 17:12.569
Really?
Yeah.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.140
Could you get my makeup bag?

17:14.170 --> 17:15.270
Somebody put it on a top shelf.

17:20.380 --> 17:21.450
Thank you.

17:24.150 --> 17:26.450
You know I'm happy for you, don't you?

17:26.490 --> 17:29.620
Of course I do.
Now, wish me luck!

17:37.400 --> 17:39.360
What did you do to the door?

17:40.170 --> 17:41.270
Nothing!

17:41.300 --> 17:43.170
You broke it, and now we're locked in here!

17:43.200 --> 17:44.570
No, no, no, no!
That wasn't me.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.470
Oh, let me guess.
It was Tinka again, right?

17:46.510 --> 17:48.210
Rightie-oh!

17:48.240 --> 17:50.340
And I helped!

17:50.380 --> 17:53.540
Now you are stuck in there and
I will go on in your place!

17:53.580 --> 17:54.580
Ha-ha!

17:54.610 --> 17:55.610
Oh!

18:00.620 --> 18:03.320
I never doubted you.
I knew it was her all along.

18:09.260 --> 18:12.400
Okay, what do you say, instead of lions,

18:12.430 --> 18:14.300
we go to the petting zoo?

18:14.330 --> 18:16.470
Oh, I can wreak some serious
havoc with those baby chicks.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.170
That's a great idea.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.210
Are you kidding me?

18:22.270 --> 18:23.440
Sorry.

18:23.480 --> 18:25.510
It was the churro talking.

18:25.540 --> 18:28.280
They make me so happy.

18:28.310 --> 18:30.110
Let me see.
I'm just gonna...

18:30.520 --> 18:33.280
Oh! Oh, that is good.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.420
Is that nutmeg in there?

18:35.450 --> 18:37.290
I feel a new rap coming on.

18:37.320 --> 18:39.520
Ch-ch-ch-ch-churro!

18:43.330 --> 18:46.330
Hey, that wasn't very nice.

18:46.370 --> 18:48.500
Exactly!
Rappers aren't nice!

18:48.530 --> 18:51.570
They don't talk about
petting zoos and nutmeg.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.510
Now go release those lions!

19:01.180 --> 19:06.150
<i>So, that's a cross-stitch!</i>
<i>Could be so interesting, huh?</i>

19:06.180 --> 19:08.190
<i>Hey, listen,</i> <i>coming up next</i>

19:08.220 --> 19:11.290
<i>we got two of the stars</i> <i>of the smash
hit dance show,</i> <i>Shake It Up, Chicago!</i>

19:11.320 --> 19:13.160
<i>Stick around!</i>

19:13.190 --> 19:15.460
When I get out of here,
I'm going to kill Gunther.

19:15.490 --> 19:17.430
And I'm going to kill Tinka.

19:20.370 --> 19:22.230
Hey, you sound really funny.

19:22.270 --> 19:23.400
So do you!

19:24.570 --> 19:27.540
<i>♪ All my passion</i>

19:27.570 --> 19:30.470
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, kids.
No time for you to dance,

19:30.510 --> 19:33.380
'cause we got to dance
over to the Chicago Zoo,

19:33.410 --> 19:35.180
where we got some breaking news.

19:35.210 --> 19:38.280
Cheryl, I hear some
in order, huh? S are.

19:38.320 --> 19:44.290
Yes there is, Mike.
Delivered a baby panda. Just.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.420
Sir, can you tell us what happened?

19:46.460 --> 19:48.130
Is that...
It is.

19:49.460 --> 19:51.300
<i>I was totally</i>
<i>minding my own business,</i>

19:51.330 --> 19:53.400
<i>when I saw a panda</i>
<i>needed my help.</i>

19:53.430 --> 19:58.440
<i>So I held her paw</i>
<i>"Breathe. Just breathe."</i>

20:00.140 --> 20:02.340
It was the most
I ever seen. Ing.

20:02.370 --> 20:04.510
What an amazing story.

20:04.540 --> 20:10.080
Ty Blue, you are
for children the world over.

20:10.120 --> 20:12.220
Actually, I'm also
rapper who...core.

20:12.250 --> 20:13.580
Back to you in the studio, Mike.

20:16.220 --> 20:19.220
That is a heartwarming story.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.260
Well, that's all
for today.e have.

20:21.290 --> 20:25.260
This is wishing you a good day.

20:28.570 --> 20:31.470
I can't believe after all that
nobody even got to dance.

20:31.500 --> 20:35.210
And I still can't believe we're
still locked in this room.

20:35.240 --> 20:38.110
Oh! Maybe we can call for
help on our cell phones.

20:38.140 --> 20:39.440
Good idea!
Okay.

20:45.580 --> 20:49.190
Hi, you're gonna need to call someone else.

20:52.160 --> 20:53.860
Mmm!

20:53.900 --> 20:57.200
Nothing hits the spot
like a good slice of Flynn.

20:57.230 --> 20:59.870
Can't believe you got
a pizza named after you.

20:59.900 --> 21:01.270
I work here, my uncle owns the place,

21:01.300 --> 21:03.270
and there's nothing named for me.

21:03.310 --> 21:05.240
Dude, reality check.

21:05.270 --> 21:08.110
Do you really think anybody wants to
eat something called "the Deuce."

21:10.280 --> 21:11.980
Okay, you got a point.

21:17.990 --> 21:22.160
No offense, but yuck!
The Flynn is disgusting.

21:22.190 --> 21:24.890
Translation, you're green with envy.

21:26.230 --> 21:28.260
Mmm-mmm. I'm green
with something else.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.870
I don't think the Flynn
is agreeing with me.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.380
- Number 2 pencil.
- Good idea.
