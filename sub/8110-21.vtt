ABOUT THIS FOR MONTHS.

JUST SHUT UP
AND GIVE ME A BOOST.

IT WAS UNAVOIDABLE.

01:02.330 --> 01:03.431

01:03.464 --> 01:06.100

CONFIRMED CLEAR.

YOU THINK HER SEIZURES
ARE THE RESULT OF BAD KARMA?

SPEND YOUR DAYS

03:29.877 --> 03:32.280
YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS
ABOUT OUR PATIENT?

03:32.313 --> 03:33.514
GOT SOME QUESTIONS
ABOUT WHETHER THIRTEEN

03:33.547 --> 03:35.849
REALLY BELIEVES IN KARMA
OR JUST WANTS TO.

03:35.883 --> 03:36.917
AS FOR THE PATIENT,

03:36.950 --> 03:38.719
IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY
TO BREAK INTO HER OFFICE.

03:38.752 --> 03:39.953
MIGHT WANT TO START
WITH HER HOME.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.455
WE COULD ASK TO LOOK

03:41.489 --> 03:43.857
THROUGH HER OFFICE
AND WE COULD DO AN MRI FIRST.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.726
SURE. GO AHEAD.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.362
IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN THE CASE,

03:48.396 --> 03:49.863

HAS BEEN PAID

04:25.766 --> 04:27.301
HE TOUCHED HIM ENOUGH
TO PUT HIM ON THE CANVAS

04:27.335 --> 04:28.702
AND THE OFFICIAL
COUNTED HIM OUT,

04:36.444 --> 04:38.078
LESS THAN 30 SECONDS.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.348

MY 50 BUCKS.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.489
PROVE IT OR PAY UP.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.790

04:49.823 --> 04:52.560
AND DON'T MAKE ME SEND MY BOYS
OUT LOOKING FOR YOU.

THE SAME WAY.

OF COURSE THEY ALL WORK
ON WALL STREET, SO...

05:31.699 --> 05:33.867
EVER SINCE THE FIRST
4TH OF JULY I CAN REMEMBER,

05:33.901 --> 05:36.737
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED EXPLOSIONS.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.806
WHEN I GOT TO COLLEGE
AND I HAD TO PICK A MAJOR,

05:38.839 --> 05:41.842
FIGURED I MIGHT AS WELL PICK
SOMETHING I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.411
DESTROYING THINGS.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.379
YOU WEREN'T PASSIONATE
ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE?

05:46.647 --> 05:49.750
BOMBS ARE TOOLS,
JUST LIKE ANYTHING ELSE.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.685
YOU CAN USE IT
TO MAKE THINGS BETTER

05:51.719 --> 05:53.454
OR YOU CAN USE IT
TO MAKE THINGS WORSE.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.856
I ALSO LIKE ROMANTIC POETRY

05:55.889 --> 05:57.625
AND PICNICS.

05:57.658 --> 05:58.692
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU WANT TO KNOW

05:58.726 --> 05:59.693
BEFORE WE DO THIS MRI?

05:59.727 --> 06:01.829
NOPE.

06:01.862 --> 06:02.863
TRY TO STAY AS STILL
AS POSSIBLE.

06:14.542 --> 06:15.643

OF OTHER SEATS.

06:16.677 --> 06:17.878

06:17.911 --> 06:19.613

FOR YOU

06:19.647 --> 06:21.415
AND I GOT NO PROBLEM
WITH THAT.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.451
I'M NOT GONNA ASK YOU
NICE AGAIN.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.752
JUST GO AWAY.
OR WHAT?

06:24.785 --> 06:26.787
YOU'RE SUDDENLY GONNA
FALL DOWN?

06:26.820 --> 06:28.756
LISTEN.
I GOT A PROBLEM.

06:28.789 --> 06:32.460
A GUY WHO KNOWS ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING ABOUT BOXING,

06:32.493 --> 06:34.862
BECAUSE OF YOU,
NOW THINKS HE DOES.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.730
YOU CAN IMAGINE
THE POTENTIAL RAMIFICATIONS.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.432
I NEED YOU TO GET
ON THE PHONE WITH HIM

06:38.466 --> 06:40.033
AND TELL HIM
YOU TOOK A DIVE.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.134
I DIDN'T TAKE A DIVE.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.703
TAKE A PICTURE OF YOU
TO PROVE THAT IT WAS REALLY YOU

06:42.736 --> 06:44.805
AND WE'RE DONE.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.039
JUST ENOUGH TO CONVINCE HIM.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.908
NOT ENOUGH TO GET YOU
IN ANY TROUBLE.

06:47.941 --> 06:51.111
I DIDN'T TAKE A DIVE.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.846
YEAH.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.615
THAT STORY'S
GETTING BORING.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.149
LOOK, I'M NOT
FROM THE COMMISSION.

06:56.183 --> 06:57.751
I'M NOT SOME BOOKIE.

06:57.785 --> 07:00.153
I'M A DOCTOR.
THIS IS MY I.D.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.459
LOOK, IF YOU WERE
A BOOKIE,

07:05.493 --> 07:07.127
YOU'D KNOW NO ONE PAYS A GUY
TO THROW A FIGHT

07:07.160 --> 07:08.829
HE HAS NO CHANCE TO WIN.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.898
I WAS A 12-TO-1 UNDERDOG.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.199
LOST MY LAST FIVE FIGHTS.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.834
BUT YOU WERE
THE BETTER FIGHTER.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.537
THAT LAST PUNCH
BARELY TOUCHED YOU.

07:16.570 --> 07:17.971

BY A GUY

07:18.005 --> 07:20.608

07:20.641 --> 07:21.642
LOOK AT ME.

07:21.675 --> 07:24.778
LOOK WHERE I AM,
WHAT I'M WEARING.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.548
NOW, DO I LOOK LIKE A GUY
WHO JUST GOT A PAYDAY?

07:27.581 --> 07:31.519
I DIDN'T THROW THE FIGHT.

07:31.552 --> 07:34.888
I JUST SUCK.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.163
HA!

07:43.196 --> 07:45.666
[slams door]

07:45.699 --> 07:49.169
PROOF.

07:49.202 --> 07:52.573
JUST BECAUSE HE WASN'T
HIT IN THE FACE--

07:52.606 --> 07:53.841
LOOK AT HIS PUPILS.

07:53.874 --> 07:57.711
HE HAS ANISOCORIA,
WHICH, GIVEN HIS AGE,

07:57.745 --> 07:59.079
THE ADRENALINE SURGE
OF THE FIGHT,

07:59.112 --> 08:00.247
THE FACT THAT
HE'S STILL ALIVE

08:00.280 --> 08:01.915
MEANS HE WAS TACHYCARDIC.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.084
HE HAS WOLFF-PARKINSON-WHITE
SYNDROME.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.285
THE BET WAS ON
WHO WOULD WIN,

08:05.318 --> 08:06.554
NOT WHO WOULD
LIVE THE LONGEST.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.822
IF HE'S PHYSICALLY UNABLE
TO CONTINUE

08:08.856 --> 08:10.924
BECAUSE OF
A PREEXISTING ILLNESS,

08:10.958 --> 08:12.793
THEN IT'S TECHNICALLY
A "NO CONTEST,"

08:12.826 --> 08:14.895
WHICH MEANS
ALL BETS ARE OFF.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.764
YOU KNOW THAT JUST
BECAUSE I WAS RIGHT

08:16.797 --> 08:18.298
ABOUT THIS ONE FIGHTER
DOESN'T MAKE YOU

08:18.331 --> 08:19.667
ANY LESS OF A MAN?

08:19.700 --> 08:21.935
ACTUALLY,
IT WOULD IF YOU WERE RIGHT.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.604
THEN AS I SAID EARLIER,
PROVE IT.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.873
AND ONE POSSIBLY PHOTOSHOPPED
CELL PHONE PIC

08:25.906 --> 08:28.275
DOES NOT A DIAGNOSIS MAKE.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.648
(Cesar)
OH, EXCUSE ME, DR. HOUSE.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.950
DESOLE, JE PARLE PAS ANGLAIS.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.119
I'M A CO-WORKER
OF WENDY LEE'S.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.754
I'M ALSO HER BOYFRIEND.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.823
GREAT.
I'M A GUY WHO DOESN'T CARE.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.592
SHE'S YOUR PATIENT.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.594
OH, YOU THOUGHT I DIDN'T
KNOW WHO WENDY LEE WAS?

08:46.627 --> 08:48.729
YEAH, MAKES SENSE.
I'M NOT GOOD AT NAMES.

08:48.762 --> 08:49.897
DID DR. FORTUNE
TELL YOU THAT?

08:49.930 --> 08:51.665
HER LAST BOYFRIEND
WAS A REAL NUT.

08:51.699 --> 08:52.800
HE'S BASICALLY STALKING HER.

08:52.833 --> 08:53.934
SEE, THIS IS WHAT
I DON'T CARE ABOUT.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.803
I DON'T CARE WHO CARES
ABOUT HER.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.237
USED TO CARE ABOUT HER.

08:57.270 --> 09:00.240
EITHER ONE YOU FALLS DOWN DEAD,
YOU CAN DROP ME A NOTE.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.576
I THINK I KNOW WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HER.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.778
YOU SCREWED UP
IN THE LAB

09:04.812 --> 09:07.848
AND ACCIDENTALLY SPILLED
SOME BOMB ON HER?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.817
NO.

09:09.850 --> 09:13.120
HE REALLY IS CRAZY.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.589
(Thirteen)
POISONED?

09:15.623 --> 09:17.224
APPARENTLY OUR MAD SCIENTIST

09:17.257 --> 09:19.126
IS ALSO A SLUTTY SCIENTIST

09:19.159 --> 09:21.695
WHOSE MILKSHAKES GOT ALL
THE NERDS IN THE YARD

09:21.729 --> 09:22.930
FIGHTING OVER HER.

09:22.963 --> 09:25.332
SHE'S A SLUT BECAUSE SHE'S DATED
TWO DIFFERENT GUYS AT WORK?

09:25.365 --> 09:26.700
OH, I'M SORRY.

09:26.734 --> 09:27.801
I THOUGHT WE WERE
STILL JUDGING HER.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.637
SHE'S NOT A SLUT
AND IT'S NOT POISON.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.371
WHEN WE TESTED HER BLOOD
AND CEREBRAL SPINAL FLUID

09:31.404 --> 09:32.873
FOR TOXIC EXPOSURE,
IT WAS NEGATIVE

09:32.906 --> 09:33.907
FOR EVERY POISON
WE COULD THINK OF.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.008
WELL, THAT JUST LEAVES

09:35.042 --> 09:36.844
EVERY POISON WE DIDN'T
THINK OF.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.646
SHE WORKS IN A BOMB FACTORY.

09:38.679 --> 09:39.780
(Foreman)
SO DO A LOT OF OTHER
NOT-SICK PEOPLE.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.081
THE GUY HAD ANY
ACTUAL EVIDENCE

09:41.114 --> 09:42.816
SHE WAS POISONED, HE WOULD
HAVE GONE TO THE POLICE,

09:42.850 --> 09:44.217
NOT TO US.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.686
AND IF WE HAD ANY EVIDENCE
OF WHAT WAS WRONG WITH HER,

09:45.719 --> 09:46.887
YOU'D BE SHOWING US
MRI RESULTS.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.890
I ASSUME THEY WERE NEGATIVE.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.759
COULDN'T HURT TO START ACTIVATED
CHARCOAL, SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.160
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
WOULDN'T HURT?

09:53.193 --> 09:55.228
THIS CASE IS GETTING
INTERESTING.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.964
LET'S ADD A LITTLE DANGER.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.112
HMM.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.218
[gasps]

10:18.251 --> 10:19.753
JUST BECAUSE HE HAS GUNS

10:19.787 --> 10:21.889
DOESN'T MAKE HIM A MURDERER.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.123
TELL THAT TO THE BEAR.
LOOK IN THE DESK.

10:23.156 --> 10:25.025
SEE IF HE'S GOT A DIARY
OR A JOURNAL.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.827
SOMETHING TELLS ME HE'S
NOT EXACTLY

10:26.860 --> 10:27.895
A DIARY KIND OF GUY.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.229
MAYBE A MANIFESTO.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.363
JUST LOOK.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.799
I'M GONNA CHECK OUT
THE REST OF THE PLACE,

10:31.832 --> 10:33.033
SEE IF HE'S GOT A COMPUTER.
[cell phone rings]

10:33.066 --> 10:35.035
IT'S FOREMAN.
YEP?

10:35.068 --> 10:36.269
(Foreman)
YOU BREAK IN YET?

10:36.303 --> 10:37.370
YEAH, WE'RE IN
THE ABATTOIR NOW.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.939
WHY?
YOU CAN LEAVE.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.908
I THINK TAUB AND I FOUND
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.209
[bottles clang]

10:42.242 --> 10:44.845
LOOKS LIKE SHE ACTUALLY
WAS BEING POISONED,

10:44.878 --> 10:47.314
BUT SHE'S BEEN DOING IT
TO HERSELF.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.954
I'M NOT AN ALCOHOLIC.
I KNOW.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.756
I KNOW THE WHOLE LABEL THING
IS SO LIMITING.

10:55.789 --> 10:59.059
YOU'RE A PERSON WHO HAPPENS
TO SUFFER FROM ALCOHOLISM.

10:59.092 --> 11:02.395
YOU BROKE INTO MY HOUSE AND NOW
YOU'RE BEING A SMARTASS?

11:02.429 --> 11:04.965
DURING YOUR HISTORY, YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T DRINK AT ALL.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.166
I DON'T.

11:06.199 --> 11:09.469
YOU JUST COLLECT BOTTLES.
YES.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.871
I COLLECT THEM FOR MY FRIEND.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.006
SHE USES THEM
IN HER ART PROJECTS.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.241
AND YOU'RE ASHAMED
OF THESE ART PROJECTS.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.809
THE BOTTLES WERE HIDDEN.

11:15.843 --> 11:18.712
THAT'S BECAUSE MY HOUSEKEEPER
KEEPS THROWING THEM OUT.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.147
I'VE TOLD HER
A DOZEN TIMES NOT TO,

11:20.180 --> 11:22.983
BUT EITHER SHE DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND OR SHE DOESN'T CARE.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.454
WHY WOULD SHE LIE?
THAT'S THE EASY QUESTION.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.790
SHE NEEDS A GOVERNMENT SECURITY
CLEARANCE FOR HER JOB.

11:29.823 --> 11:30.724
AND WHAT'S
THE HARD QUESTION?

11:30.758 --> 11:32.492
IF SHE'S AN ALCOHOLIC,
WHY DOESN'T SHE HAVE

11:32.525 --> 11:34.862
AT LEAST SOME PARTIALLY-FULL
BOTTLES IN THE HOUSE?

11:34.895 --> 11:36.129
I MEAN, WHY KEEP
THE EMPTIES?

11:36.163 --> 11:37.731
WHY NOT JUST
THROW THEM AWAY?

11:37.765 --> 11:40.067
SO SHE'S PROBABLY
TELLING THE TRUTH.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.936
SO WHAT DO WE DO?

11:42.970 --> 11:47.507
WE START HER ON VALIUM
FOR ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.277
IT'S THE BEST
WE'VE GOT RIGHT NOW.

11:56.249 --> 11:59.753
ONE NORMAL EKG DOES NOT
A HEALTHY PERSON MAKE.

11:59.787 --> 12:01.321
LOOK, I TOLD YOU
I JUST SUCK.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.323
OH, YOU MAKE ME SO SAD.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.358
DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.
WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH?

12:05.392 --> 12:07.494
KILL ME FOR LOVING
MY PATIENTS.

12:07.527 --> 12:08.862
IT'S JUST WHAT I DO.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.864
[sighs]

12:10.898 --> 12:13.400
HEY, STOP.
STOP!

12:16.970 --> 12:18.939
LOOK, MY--MY LEG HURTS.
OKAY?

12:18.972 --> 12:20.373
JUST TALK TO ME
FOR A MOMENT.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.918
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE A LOSER.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.153
[scoffs]
THANKS.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.955
WHATEVER'S WRONG WITH YOU,
IT'S REAL.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.356
SICK IS GOOD.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.490
SICK MEANS
YOU CAN GET BETTER.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.159
YOU COULD GET BETTER.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.261
AND I DON'T MEAN HEALTHIER.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.897
I MEAN...

12:43.931 --> 12:46.166
MAYBE YOU DON'T
HAVE TO SUCK.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.273
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOURSELF.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.008
LEAVE ME ALONE.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.348
[screams]

13:01.381 --> 13:03.450
(Hoffner)
ABDOMINAL PAIN.

13:03.483 --> 13:06.119
(Cesar)
SHE SAID IT FELT LIKE
SHE WAS BEING STABBED.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.955
AH!

13:07.988 --> 13:09.823
GIVE HER MORPHINE,
5 MILLIGRAMS IV.

13:09.857 --> 13:12.259
(Taub)
IS IT A SYMPTOM
OF THE UNDERLYING CONDITION

13:12.292 --> 13:14.061
OR A SYMPTOM
OF OUR TREATMENT?

13:14.094 --> 13:16.163
WE'LL KNOW SOON.
I STOPPED HER TREATMENT.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.931
WE SHOULD RESTART IT.

13:17.965 --> 13:18.932
ACUTE PANCREATITIS
FROM ALCOHOLISM

13:18.966 --> 13:19.933
WOULD CAUSE
THIS KIND OF PAIN.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.268
IT'S STRESS RELATED.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.003
SHE'S IN A LOT OF PAIN.
SHE'S UNDER A LOT OF STRESS.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.504
SHE'S GOT TWO GUYS
FIGHTING OVER HER

13:24.537 --> 13:26.606
AND SHE GOT DONE WITH
THE FINAL TEST OF A NEW BOMB.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.842
HER GUILT IS KILLING HER.

13:28.876 --> 13:29.943
AS FAR AS YOU KNOW,
SHE LIKES BEING THE CENTER

13:29.977 --> 13:30.844
OF ATTENTION
AND LOVES HER JOB.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.279
AS FAR AS YOU KNOW,
SHE DOESN'T DRINK.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.080
(Chase)
WHAT IF IT'S
A KIDNEY INFECTION?

13:33.113 --> 13:34.447
ACUTE PYELONEPHRITIS
COULD KILL HER

13:34.481 --> 13:36.950
IF WE DON'T
START HER ON IV ANTIBIOTICS.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.351
WOULD KILL HER IF
IT WAS PYELONEPHRITIS,

13:38.385 --> 13:39.953
BUT SINCE HER URINE
AND CSF

13:39.987 --> 13:40.888
DON'T SHOW SIGNS
OF INFECTION--

13:40.921 --> 13:43.623
I PAGED HOUSE.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.093
WHAT?
WE GOT NOTHING.

13:46.126 --> 13:48.128
LESS THAN NOTHING SINCE HE'S
ACTUALLY IGNORING MY PAGES,

13:48.161 --> 13:49.897
WHICH MEANS WE HAVE
A SICK PATIENT

13:49.930 --> 13:51.965
AND APPARENTLY A SICK BOSS.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.149
TELL HIM YOU ADMIT
HE'S RIGHT.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.651
LET'S GET HIM BACK
TO WORK.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.921
IF HE'S IGNORING YOU,
IT'S BECAUSE HE TRUSTS YOU.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.188
NO, IT'S NOT.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.456
NO, IT'S NOT,
BUT HE DOES.

14:16.489 --> 14:17.657
THANKS.
I FEEL WARM INSIDE.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.359
RIGHT NOW I'M DEBATING

14:19.392 --> 14:21.561
WHICH BAD IDEA I SHOULD
PRETEND IS A GOOD IDEA

14:21.594 --> 14:23.163
AND FORCE EVERYBODY
TO IMPLEMENT.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.398
I THINK THIS IS
GOOD FOR HIM.

14:25.432 --> 14:26.533
OBSESSING OVER A BET
IS GOOD?

14:26.566 --> 14:28.969
AND DOING HIS ACTUAL JOB,
TREATING ACTUAL PATIENTS,

14:29.002 --> 14:30.037
THAT'S BAD?

14:30.070 --> 14:31.638
HOUSE ONLY DOING
WHAT HOUSE WANTS

14:31.671 --> 14:33.240
IS THE ONLY WAY
HE CAN FUNCTION.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.908
SINCE THE BREAKUP,
HE'S BEEN SEEKING OUT

14:34.942 --> 14:39.046
CRAZIER AND CRAZIER THINGS
TO DO BECAUSE THEY'RE CRAZY.

14:39.079 --> 14:42.682
THIS IS--WELL,
IT'S NOT CRAZY.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.018
NO, JUST IRRESPONSIBLE
AND POSSIBLY DANGEROUS.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.219
BY HOUSE STANDARDS,
IT'S DULL.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.021
THIS HE'S DOING

14:48.055 --> 14:49.289
JUST BECAUSE HE'S INTERESTED.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.658
I THINK HOUSE
GETTING BACK TO DOING...

14:51.691 --> 14:53.693
STUPID HOUSE STUFF
FOR STUPID HOUSE REASONS

14:53.726 --> 14:56.529
IS THE BEST THING
THAT COULD HAPPEN TO HIM.

14:56.563 --> 15:00.467
I'LL GO EXPLAIN THAT
TO THE PATIENT.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.105
[door opens and closes]

15:06.739 --> 15:08.976
[gasps]

15:48.048 --> 15:51.018
[electronic beeping]

15:51.051 --> 15:52.685
(Taub)
IT'S DEFINITELY
NOT PANCREATITIS.

15:52.719 --> 15:56.189
RESTARTING THE TREATMENT
OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T HELP ANYTHING.

15:56.223 --> 15:58.691
I ASSUME YOU TESTED
FOR INFECTIONS.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.327
AND I ASSUME THAT LOOK MEANS
"YES, AND I WAS WRONG."

16:00.360 --> 16:02.229
YOU CALL FOR A PSYCH CONSULT?

16:02.262 --> 16:03.263
WOW.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.365
THAT'S THE SAME LOOK
I JUST GOT FROM CHASE.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.300
SO AN HOUR AGO,
WE HAD THREE THEORIES

16:07.334 --> 16:08.335
WE COULDN'T AGREE ON.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.970
NOW WE'VE GOT NO THEORIES,
BUT WE'RE IN AGREEMENT.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.609
CT AND ULTRASOUND
SHOWED INFLAMMATION

16:16.643 --> 16:18.345
IN THE RENAL CAPSULE.

16:18.378 --> 16:19.746
COULD BE
AN OBSTRUCTING CALCULUS

16:19.779 --> 16:21.681
OR A PERINEPHRIC ABSCESS.

16:21.714 --> 16:22.782
BLOOD CULTURES
CAME BACK NEGATIVE.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.017
IT'S PROBABLY JUST
A BENIGN CYST.

16:24.051 --> 16:26.086
YES, LET'S JUST DISMISS AN IDEA
BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.020
(Thirteen)
COULD BE GAS
IN THE PERINEPHRIC SPACE,

16:27.054 --> 16:28.455
IN WHICH CASE,
WE SHOULD BE PREPPING HER

16:28.488 --> 16:29.556
FOR EMERGENCY SURGERY.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.724
[door opens]

16:31.758 --> 16:34.161
WHAT LOOKS LIKE
WOLFF-PARKINSON-WHITE

16:34.194 --> 16:36.029
BUT ISN'T?

16:38.231 --> 16:41.301
HER EKG WAS NORMAL.
SO WAS HIS.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.435
THAT'S WHY I SAID "LOOKS LIKE."

16:42.469 --> 16:45.072
AS IN SIMILAR TO,
BUT NOT THE SAME.

16:45.105 --> 16:49.176
YOU WANT US TO HELP YOU
GET OUT OF PAYING YOUR BET

16:49.209 --> 16:51.511
WHILE YOUR ACTUAL PATIENT
LIES IN AGONY.

16:51.544 --> 16:54.747
WHO'S THE REAL
BAD GUY HERE?

16:54.781 --> 16:56.283
THE GUY WHO DOESN'T
CARE ENOUGH TO HELP

16:56.316 --> 16:59.686
OR THE FOUR GUYS WHO ARE
NOT COMPETENT ENOUGH TO HELP?

16:59.719 --> 17:01.288
HE WORKS OUT TOO MUCH,
GETS POUNDED TOO MUCH,

17:01.321 --> 17:03.290
AND NOT IN THE ROMANTIC WAY.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.225
HIS PUPILS--
I GOT IT.

17:07.427 --> 17:08.595
YOUR PATIENT?
NO.

17:08.628 --> 17:09.596
PLENTY OF TIME
TO SAVE HER LIFE

17:09.629 --> 17:11.731
AFTER WE SAVE MY MONEY.

17:11.764 --> 17:13.400
UNDERLYING NEUROLOGICAL
CONDITION

17:13.433 --> 17:16.236
EXACERBATED BY AN ACUTE UTI
BROUGHT ON

17:16.269 --> 17:17.770
BY HER SEXUAL ESCAPADES.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.072
SLUT?
ESCAPADES?

17:19.106 --> 17:20.073
HOW DO WE TREAT?
A SCARLET "A"?

17:20.107 --> 17:21.108
SORRY.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.242
ACUTE UTI BROUGHT ON

17:22.275 --> 17:24.344
BY HER HEALTHY ENJOYMENT
OF HER WOMANHOOD.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.247
WE START HER ON IV AMPICILLIN
AND AN AMINOGLYCOSIDE.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.191
YOU IGNORE US ALL THE TIME.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.826
YOU GO ON CRAZY JOYRIDES
ALL THE TIME.

17:39.859 --> 17:43.763
BUT YOU ANSWER PAGES,
YOU SLEEP.

17:43.796 --> 17:46.199
I KNOW I'M GONNA
REGRET DOING THIS,

17:46.233 --> 17:47.634
BUT I'LL ASK ANYWAY.

17:47.667 --> 17:52.239
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO HELP?

17:52.272 --> 17:54.274
ALTHOUGH...

18:09.422 --> 18:12.292
(House)
GREAT NEWS!

18:12.325 --> 18:15.462
YOU HAVE AN UNDERLYING
NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION,

18:15.495 --> 18:17.264
WHICH TOGETHER
WITH YOUR HEART--

18:17.297 --> 18:18.598
YOU SAID
MY HEART WAS FINE.

18:18.631 --> 18:21.601
YEAH, I ALSO SAID I WOULD
GET YOU YOUR CAREER BACK.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.603
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM
TO MATTER

18:23.636 --> 18:25.905
SINCE YOU'VE SO
CLEARLY BEEN HANDED

18:25.938 --> 18:27.640
THE GOLDEN SPIT BUCKET.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.679
SYMPATHETIC OVERDRIVE.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.348
IT'S A MEDICAL TERM.

18:35.382 --> 18:38.818
SO IS "GREAT NEWS."

18:38.851 --> 18:42.622
OF COURSE,
IF YOU PREFER WALLOWING...

18:42.655 --> 18:45.358
ALL YOU NEED IS A CHIN.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.260
AND A HEART,
APPARENTLY.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.695
THEN YOU CAN GO BACK

18:48.728 --> 18:49.862
TO BEING THE GUY WHO WON

18:49.896 --> 18:51.298
20 OF HIS FIRST 20
INSTEAD OF THE GUY

18:51.331 --> 18:53.266
WHO LOST 5 OF HIS LAST 5.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.569
ALTHOUGH, TECHNICALLY, I COUNT
THE LAST ONE AS A "NO CONTEST."

18:56.603 --> 18:58.538
AND YOU SAVE 50 BUCKS.
I'M A DOCTOR.

18:58.571 --> 19:01.374
I DON'T TELL A FAT GUY TO
LAY OFF BACON FOR LESS THAN 300.

19:01.408 --> 19:03.176
[scoffs]

19:03.210 --> 19:06.513
THIS IS ABOUT DIGNITY
FOR BOTH OF US.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.781
GIVE ME YOUR ARM.

19:11.418 --> 19:15.422
GIVE ME YOUR ARM.

19:15.455 --> 19:18.225
WHAT THE HELL?

19:18.258 --> 19:19.226
DON'T WORRY.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.560
IT'S JUST EPINEPHRINE.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.229
EP--IS IT DANGEROUS?

19:22.262 --> 19:23.263
IN THE WRONG HANDS, VERY.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.698
SO...YEAH, SORT OF.

19:25.732 --> 19:29.836
THIS WILL ONLY TAKE
A FEW SECONDS.

19:29.869 --> 19:33.240
AND...YOU ARE TACHYCARDIC.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.242
[breathing heavily]

19:35.275 --> 19:36.943
YO, ARE YOU PSYCHO?

19:36.976 --> 19:39.412
WE COMBINE THE INCREASED
HEART RATE WITH CHEST TRAUMA

19:39.446 --> 19:41.314
BY APPLYING A LITTLE
SWEET SCIENCE TO THE SCIENCE.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.250
DON'T WORRY.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.218
I'LL--I'LL EXPLAIN MORE
WHEN YOU WAKE UP.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.919
NOW, THE PUNCH THAT
SUPPOSEDLY KNOCKED YOU OUT

19:46.953 --> 19:48.755
LOOKED LIKE IT WAS THROWN
BY AN OLD CRIPPLE.

19:48.788 --> 19:49.922
KIND OF LIKE THIS.

19:49.956 --> 19:52.392
LOOK, STOP IT.

19:52.425 --> 19:53.593
(House)
THREE...

19:53.626 --> 19:57.264
TWO, ONE.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.400
HUH.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.535
SEEM TO BE OLDER AND MORE
CRIPPLED THAN I THOUGHT.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.704
LOOK--NO.
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.

20:04.737 --> 20:07.240
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

20:07.274 --> 20:09.276
MAYBE IF I--

20:09.309 --> 20:13.580
[grunts]

20:13.613 --> 20:16.749
LOOK, GET THE HELL OUT
OF MY LIFE, YOU LUNATIC.

20:24.023 --> 20:27.460
[heart monitor
beeping frantically]

20:27.494 --> 20:28.661
SHE'S IN V-TACH.
BP'S DROPPING.

20:28.695 --> 20:29.996
WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING
ISN'T WORKING AGAIN.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.964
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME WAY
TO STOP THE SEIZURES.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.966
IT'S NOT A SEIZURE.
SHE'S HAVING A HEART ATTACK.

20:34.000 --> 20:34.934
NO PULSE.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

20:34.967 --> 20:36.836
SHE RUNS MARATHONS!

20:36.869 --> 20:40.407
[defibrillator powers on]

20:40.440 --> 20:42.942
CHARGING TO 200.
CLEAR.

20:42.975 --> 20:43.876
STILL NO PULSE.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.412
CHARGING TO 300.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.480
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?
CLEAR.

20:47.514 --> 20:49.782
MY THEORY IS THAT
HE'S ONLY AVOIDING US

20:49.816 --> 20:51.284
BECAUSE HE REALLY
WANTS TO AVOID YOU.

20:51.318 --> 20:53.953
MA NISHTANAH?

20:53.986 --> 20:56.856
YOU MADE IT THROUGH MED SCHOOL
WITHOUT EVER ATTENDING A SEDER?

20:56.889 --> 20:57.957
IT MEANS
"WHY IS THIS NIGHT DIFFERENT

20:57.990 --> 20:58.991
FROM ALL OTHER NIGHTS?"

20:59.025 --> 21:00.927
I'M NOT SURE IT IS.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.062
BUT USUALLY WHEN PUSH
COMES TO SHOVE, HE SHOWS UP.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.897
IF THE PATIENT'S STILL ALIVE,
THEN PUSH HASN'T MET SHOVE YET.

21:04.931 --> 21:05.998
PATIENT IS HANGING
BY A THREAD

21:06.032 --> 21:07.467
AND WE DON'T HAVE
A CLUE WHY.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.603
THEN WE HAVE TO ASSUME
HE DOES AND SHE ISN'T.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.972
WE COULD OR WE COULD
ASSUME THAT SOMETHING

21:13.005 --> 21:14.407
IS SERIOUSLY WRONG
WITH HOUSE

21:14.441 --> 21:15.875
AND TRY TO DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT.

21:15.908 --> 21:18.878
THIS WAY, EVEN IF WE'RE WRONG,
NOBODY DIES.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.813
HOUSE IS FINE.

21:20.847 --> 21:23.583
HOUSE IS ALWAYS FINE.
[elevator bell rings]

21:23.616 --> 21:25.318
I'M EXPANDING MY THEORY.

21:25.352 --> 21:28.020
HE'S AVOIDING YOU
AND YOU'RE AVOIDING HIM

21:28.054 --> 21:29.088
AND THIS PATIENT
IS GONNA DIE.

21:29.121 --> 21:33.360
NOT IF YOU DO YOUR JOB.

21:48.007 --> 21:51.644
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.012
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

21:53.045 --> 21:56.949
MY BOSS HAS ME BREAK
INTO PLACES ALL THE TIME.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.389
PAIN HAS BEEN GETTING WORSE.

22:02.422 --> 22:05.525
I FIGURED IF I UPPED
THE VICODIN ANY MORE,

22:05.558 --> 22:06.659
I'D END UP BACK
IN A RUBBER ROOM,

22:06.693 --> 22:11.030
SO THIS SEEMED
LIKE THE SMARTER CHOICE.

22:11.063 --> 22:13.566
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.802
YOU DROVE ALL THE WAY
OVER HERE

22:15.835 --> 22:17.737
TO BREAK IN
AND CALL ME AN IDIOT?

22:17.770 --> 22:19.672
NO, I DROVE ALL THE WAY
OVER HERE TO TELL YOU

22:19.706 --> 22:21.708
WE'RE IMPLANTING AN AUTOMATED
CARDIO-DEFIBRILLATOR,

22:21.741 --> 22:23.643
WHICH WON'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING
TO HELP THE PATIENT

22:23.676 --> 22:25.445
EXCEPT MAYBE GIVE US ENOUGH TIME
TO COME UP WITH A GUESS

22:25.478 --> 22:28.515
AS TO WHAT'S ACTUALLY
WRONG WITH HER.

22:28.548 --> 22:30.550
OH, THAT MAKES MORE SENSE.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.752
AND I BROKE IN HERE
BECAUSE CUDDY AND WILSON

22:32.785 --> 22:35.888
BOTH SEPARATELY ASKED ME TO.

22:35.922 --> 22:38.090
EVEN MORE LOGICAL.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.860
AND THAT'S NOT HEROIN,

22:40.893 --> 22:42.995
WHICH MEANS YOU KNEW
I WAS COMING OVER HERE,

22:43.029 --> 22:43.896
AND CUDDY AND WILSON
ARE RIGHT.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.498
YOU'RE JUST PLAYING A GAME.

22:45.532 --> 22:48.367
THROWING OUT A BONE
AND WATCHING US FIGHT OVER IT.

22:50.537 --> 22:52.405
THERE IS ANOTHER THEORY.

22:58.010 --> 23:01.914
COMPOUND CS-804.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.049
IT'S AN EXPERIMENTAL DRUG

23:03.082 --> 23:06.653
THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO REGROW MUSCLE.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.191
THIS EXPERIMENT
WAS DONE ON RATS.

23:12.224 --> 23:15.962
IT'S GROUNDBREAKING.
HUGE SUCCESS.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.998
IN RATS.

23:19.031 --> 23:22.068
WELL, THEY GOT FOUR LEGS.

23:22.101 --> 23:25.738
THINK HOW FAST
IT SHOULD WORK ON ONE.

23:29.876 --> 23:31.077
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.517
[door opens and closes]

23:53.232 --> 23:54.233
WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.367
AICD NOT WORKING?

23:55.401 --> 23:57.504
IF IT'S THE DEFIBRILLATOR,
I'D BE LOOKING ELSEWHERE.

23:57.537 --> 23:58.204
SMELLS LIKE BLEEDING.

23:58.237 --> 23:59.205
RECTAL?

23:59.238 --> 24:02.141
AND VAGINAL.

24:02.174 --> 24:04.711
(Foreman)
IS IT POSSIBLE SOMETHING GOT
PERFORATED DURING SURGERY?

24:04.744 --> 24:06.045
IS THAT AN ACCUSATION?

24:06.078 --> 24:07.580
SOUNDED LIKE A QUESTION.

24:07.614 --> 24:09.015
JUST A STRAIGHTFORWARD INQUIRY

24:09.048 --> 24:10.517
THAT ONLY SOMEONE
WITH SERIOUS INSECURITIES

24:10.550 --> 24:12.552
WOULD TAKE ISSUE WITH.

24:12.585 --> 24:15.154
OKAY, SO IN ANSWERING,
I HAVE TO DECIDE

24:15.187 --> 24:17.023
BETWEEN THE ONLY
TWO POSSIBILITIES.

24:17.056 --> 24:20.126
"NO" AND "YES, WE MIGHT HAVE
SCREWED SOMETHING UP,

24:20.159 --> 24:21.127
"BUT ARE INTENTIONALLY
HIDING IT

24:21.160 --> 24:23.863
BECAUSE WE'RE INCOMPETENT
AND WE'RE ASSES."

24:23.896 --> 24:25.264
ANSWER IS "NO."

24:25.297 --> 24:27.133
GLAD WE DIDN'T SHORTCHANGE
THAT AVENUE.

24:27.166 --> 24:28.535
IT'S A BLOOD DISORDER.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.136
A COAGULOPATHY.
THAT'S NOT A DIAGNOSIS.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.871
THAT'S LIKE SAYING
SHE HAS A RUNNY NOSE.

24:31.904 --> 24:33.640
TRUE, BUT NOT SAYING
SHE HAS A RUNNY NOSE

24:33.673 --> 24:35.207
RISKS GETTING SNOT
ALL OVER US.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.577
WE CAN TREAT IT.
CAUSE COULD STILL BE A TOXIN.

24:37.610 --> 24:38.678
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN EXPOSED
TO WHO KNOWS--

24:38.711 --> 24:40.279
PAST TENSE, WHICH MEANS
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER

24:40.312 --> 24:41.614
NOW THAT SHE'S NOT.

24:41.648 --> 24:45.251
SAME GOES FOR HOUSE.

24:45.284 --> 24:46.118
IF THIS WAS ABOUT CUDDY,

24:46.152 --> 24:47.086
HE WOULD HAVE CHECKED OUT
WEEKS AGO.

24:47.119 --> 24:49.221
SOMETHING ELSE IS GOING ON.
SOMETHING NEW.

24:49.255 --> 24:50.623
THAT'S AN AWFULLY
SIMPLISTIC APPROACH

24:50.657 --> 24:51.958
TO MATTERS OF THE HEART.

24:51.991 --> 24:52.992
HOUSE IS RATIONAL.
HE PRIDES HIMSELF--

24:53.025 --> 24:54.761
NO ONE IS RATIONAL
ABOUT EMOTION.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.796
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE EMOTIONS.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.030
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

24:58.064 --> 25:00.166
ME? I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
EXACTLY.

25:00.199 --> 25:02.134
YOU ALWAYS HAVE SOME OPINION
ON THESE THINGS,

25:02.168 --> 25:03.235
ESPECIALLY
WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSE,

25:03.269 --> 25:05.572
DOUBLE ESPECIALLY WHEN
IT COMES TO MEN AND ROMANCE,

25:05.605 --> 25:07.707
BUT SUDDENLY YOU'RE KEEPING
YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

25:12.612 --> 25:14.246
HOUSE CAN'T HELP US.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.982
I RESPECT HIS PRIVACY,

25:16.015 --> 25:17.717
NO MATTER HOW STUPID
AND I'D APPRECIATE IT

25:17.750 --> 25:19.619
IF YOU'D RESPECT MINE.

25:23.590 --> 25:25.625
WE NEED TO TREAT
THE UNDERLYING CONDITION.

25:25.658 --> 25:28.227
COULD BE CANCER, SEPSIS,
TRAUMA,

25:28.260 --> 25:29.762
LIVER DISEASE,
HEMORRHAGIC FEVER--

25:29.796 --> 25:31.063
I'M GONNA START TREATING
THE SYMPTOMS

25:31.097 --> 25:33.666
WHILE YOU FINISH LISTING
THE POSSIBLE CAUSES.

25:43.242 --> 25:45.244
[grunts]

26:12.905 --> 26:14.741
(Riggin)
THE RATS ARE DOING GREAT.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.643
(House)
"GREAT" IS A LITTLE VAGUE.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.645
EVEN BETTER THAN
THE PREVIOUS STUDY.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.847
12% INCREASE IN STRENGTH,

26:20.880 --> 26:23.683
22% IN FLEXIBILITY,
AND SOME IMPROVEMENT

26:23.716 --> 26:25.051
IN AT LEAST 60%
OF THE SUBJECTS.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.786
HAVE YOU DONE MAXIMUM
TOLERATED DOSE STUDIES?

26:26.819 --> 26:28.020
NOT YET.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.622
BUT THAT'S PART
OF THE BEAUTY.

26:29.656 --> 26:31.958
SINCE THE COMPOUND
IS EASILY EXCRETED IN URINE,

26:31.991 --> 26:33.626
AS LONG AS THEY KEEP HYDRATED,

26:33.660 --> 26:36.095
THERE'S REALLY NO REASON
TO EXPECT ANY DANGER

26:36.128 --> 26:38.130
AT VIRTUALLY ANY DOSE.

26:38.164 --> 26:40.633
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T
KNOW FOR SURE.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.301
BUT IF IT'S WORTHY
OF THE PREFACE "OBVIOUSLY,"

26:42.334 --> 26:45.672
THEN OBVIOUSLY IT ONLY NEEDS
TO BE EXPLAINED TO IDIOTS.

26:45.705 --> 26:47.273
DO I LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT?

26:50.176 --> 26:52.979
SORRY.

26:53.012 --> 26:54.013
CRANKY.

26:54.046 --> 26:56.215
WHAT I MEANT
TO SAY WAS:

26:56.248 --> 26:57.349
WHY DON'T SCIENTISTS
HAVE GROUPIES?

26:57.383 --> 27:00.152
'CAUSE I'D DO YOU RIGHT NOW
IF SOCIETY WASN'T TELLING ME

27:00.186 --> 27:03.690
THAT YOU'RE JUST
AN UNDERPAID DORK.

27:03.723 --> 27:06.793
THANK YOU.

27:06.826 --> 27:07.727
[winces]

27:07.760 --> 27:09.696
YOU ALL RIGHT?

27:09.729 --> 27:12.965
LEG HURTS.

27:12.999 --> 27:15.401
WOULD YOU MIND
GETTING ME A COFFEE?

27:15.434 --> 27:18.771
HOW DOES COFFEE
HELP YOUR LEG?

27:18.805 --> 27:20.807
IT WILL PREVENT ME
FROM WALKING TO GET THE COFFEE.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.810
RIGHT.

27:48.467 --> 27:51.203
PAGE SAID SHE'S NOW BLEEDING
FROM HER MOUTH.

27:51.237 --> 27:52.739
YOU START TREATMENT?

27:52.772 --> 27:53.873
I SAID I WOULD.

27:53.906 --> 27:54.974
A "YES" WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE.

27:55.007 --> 27:58.711
NOT ASKING THE QUESTION
WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN BETTER.

27:58.745 --> 28:00.012
ANY BREATHING ISSUES?

28:00.046 --> 28:01.413
NO, BUT--

28:01.447 --> 28:03.349
I'M NOT SURE
IT'S INTERNAL.

28:03.382 --> 28:05.017
IF IT'S COMING FROM BOTH ENDS,
IT'S INTERNAL.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.886
HER GUMS LOOK LIKE
THEY WERE BURNED.

28:22.434 --> 28:24.436
[sharp breathing]

29:32.238 --> 29:37.143
[knock on door]

29:37.176 --> 29:40.947
(Wilson)
EXPERIMENTAL DRUGS?

29:40.980 --> 29:43.415
THAT'S UNFAIR.

29:43.449 --> 29:44.884
'CAUSE AT ONE POINT,
EVEN VICODIN

29:44.917 --> 29:46.385
WAS AN EXPERIMENTAL DRUG.

29:46.418 --> 29:47.887
I HAVE TO GO.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.221
WELL, UNLESS YOU'RE GOING
TO DO YOUR JOB,

29:49.255 --> 29:51.023
IT CAN WAIT.
I'M GOING TO DO MY JOB.

29:51.057 --> 29:55.061
I'LL GIVE YOU A LIFT.

29:55.094 --> 29:56.595
I'LL GIVE YOU TWO MINUTES.

29:56.628 --> 29:59.398
BUT FIRST, I'M GONNA TELL YOU
THAT I'M OFF THE DRUGS

29:59.431 --> 30:00.900
AND YOU'LL FEEL SILLY
'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT

30:00.933 --> 30:02.234
NOTHING TO SAY
FOR TWO MINUTES.

30:02.268 --> 30:04.236
HMM.

30:04.270 --> 30:05.371
WHY ARE YOU OFF THEM?

30:05.404 --> 30:06.438
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WORK.

30:06.472 --> 30:07.606
WHY WERE YOU ON THEM?

30:07.639 --> 30:10.076
BECAUSE THEY COME
IN BANANA FLAVOR.

30:10.109 --> 30:13.212
YOU KNOW THE ANSWER.

30:13.245 --> 30:16.382
YOU THINK FIXING YOUR LEG
WILL FIX YOUR LIFE.

30:16.415 --> 30:17.984
I THINK THAT MY LIFE
WILL BE SOMEWHAT BETTER

30:18.017 --> 30:20.086
IF PART OF MY LIFE,
SPECIFICALLY MY LEG,

30:20.119 --> 30:21.954
IS SOMEWHAT BETTER.

30:21.988 --> 30:23.890
YOU THINK ALL YOUR PROBLEMS
ARE YOUR LEG.

30:23.923 --> 30:25.157
AND YOU'RE HERE TO TELL ME
THAT NO MATTER

30:25.191 --> 30:27.960
HOW DEPRESSED I MAY BE,
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

30:27.994 --> 30:30.362
I THINK YOU WANT EVERYTHING
TO BE PHYSICAL, TANGIBLE,

30:30.396 --> 30:32.198
SIMPLE.

30:32.231 --> 30:33.499
YOU WANT UNHAPPINESS
TO HAVE A CURE.

30:33.532 --> 30:34.633
HOUSE, YOU OBVIOUSLY--

30:34.666 --> 30:36.903
I HATE THAT WORD.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.637
I HAVE TO GO NOW.

30:38.670 --> 30:39.771
ACTUALLY, I DON'T,

30:39.805 --> 30:42.474
BUT IT WOULD BE RUDE TO WALK OUT
WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING.

30:42.508 --> 30:43.542
(Cameron)
WHAT ABOUT THIS?

30:43.575 --> 30:45.644
28-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
PRESENTING WITH BURN-LIKE WOUNDS

30:45.677 --> 30:46.879
IN HER MOUTH AND ESOPHAGUS

30:46.913 --> 30:48.915
FROM A CANDIDIASIS INFECTION.

30:48.948 --> 30:50.116
INTERESTING.

30:50.149 --> 30:51.918
IT WOULD ALSO BE RELEVANT
IF THE WOMAN HAD HAD SEIZURES.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.285
IF THE FUNGUS HAD ENTERED
HER BLOODSTREAM--

30:53.319 --> 30:54.453
WE WOULD HAVE SEEN IT
IN THE BLOOD WORK.

30:54.486 --> 30:55.454
ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA

30:55.487 --> 30:56.889
CAN CAUSE SWELLING
IN THE GUMS.

30:56.923 --> 30:58.490
AGAIN, INTERESTING
BUT NOT RELEVANT.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.326
AGAIN, YOU'RE BEING AN ASS.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.928
SHE DOESN'T HAVE A HISTORY
OF BLOOD DISEASES IN HER FAMILY,

31:01.961 --> 31:03.195
HER BLOOD COUNT'S NORMAL,
AND SHE HASN'T

31:03.229 --> 31:04.897
BEEN EXPOSED
TO CHEMICAL TOXINS.

31:04.931 --> 31:06.665
NOT THAT WE KNOW OF.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.901
GUY THAT SHE WORKS MOST CLOSELY
WITH IS ALSO HER BOYFRIEND.

31:08.935 --> 31:10.136
YOU DON'T THINK
HE WOULD HAVE TOLD US

31:10.169 --> 31:12.571
IF THERE HAD BEEN SOME SORT
OF CHEMICAL SPILL OR ACCIDENT?

31:12.604 --> 31:17.609
THERE IS ONE OTHER CAUSE
OF AML.

31:17.643 --> 31:19.411
WAIT!

31:19.445 --> 31:20.546
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING HER?

31:20.579 --> 31:21.613
WE NEED TO GET HER
INTO AN ISOLATION ROOM

31:21.647 --> 31:23.916
AND PREP FOR A HEMATOPOIETIC
STEM CELL TRANSPLANT.

31:23.950 --> 31:25.317
ISOLATION? WHY?

31:25.351 --> 31:26.986
WE THINK HER BLOOD
AND IMMUNE SYSTEM

31:27.019 --> 31:29.088
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BY AN
EXPOSURE TO IONIZING RADIATION.

31:29.121 --> 31:30.389
BUT WE DON'T WORK
WITH RADIATION.

31:30.422 --> 31:31.623
WELL, APPARENTLY
YOUR GIRLFRIEND DOES.

31:31.657 --> 31:33.459
NO, SHE DOESN'T.
YOU'RE WRONG.

31:33.492 --> 31:35.394
IT MUST BE SOMETHING ELSE.

31:35.427 --> 31:36.628
WE FOUND REPORTS
THAT YOUR COMPANY

31:36.662 --> 31:37.629
WAS DEVELOPING TACTICAL
NUCLEAR WARHEADS

31:37.663 --> 31:38.630
FOR BUNKER-BUSTING BOMBS.

31:38.664 --> 31:40.699
WHERE? ON WIKIPEDIA?
SOME PARANOID IDIOT'S BLOG?

31:40.732 --> 31:41.700
I DON'T CARE WHERE
YOU READ IT.

31:41.733 --> 31:42.634
IT'S NOT TRUE.

31:42.668 --> 31:44.570
YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S
ABSOLUTELY NO CHANCE

31:44.603 --> 31:45.771
THAT ANYONE IN YOUR COMPANY
IS DOING

31:45.804 --> 31:47.639
ANY EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT?

31:47.673 --> 31:51.343
NO, BUT I KNOW WENDY
AND SHE WOULDN'T.

31:51.377 --> 31:52.344
WELL, MAYBE YOU DON'T KNOW HER
AS WELL AS YOU THOUGHT YOU DID.

31:52.378 --> 31:55.614
EXCUSE ME.
WE HAVE TO GO.

32:05.691 --> 32:08.227
YOU NEED A DRINK.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.096
I'M FINE.

32:10.129 --> 32:11.397
THAT WASN'T A QUESTION.

32:11.430 --> 32:13.365
YOU REALLY DO NEED A DRINK.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.605
(Foreman)
FOUND A MATCH.

32:19.638 --> 32:20.973
WE'LL START TREATMENT
AS SOON

32:21.007 --> 32:22.641
AS WE GET THE HSC
FROM THE DONOR.

32:22.674 --> 32:24.076
SHOULDN'T BE LONG.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.411
(Lee)
WHERE'S CESAR?

32:25.444 --> 32:28.014
UH, HE'S
IN THE WAITING ROOM.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.315
I WANT TO SEE HIM.

32:29.348 --> 32:30.549
YOU CAN'T.

32:30.582 --> 32:32.618
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS WITH YOUR
IMMUNE SYSTEM THIS COMPROMISED.

32:32.651 --> 32:37.689
WHY CAN'T HE JUST PUT ON
A GOWN AND A MASK LIKE YOU?

32:37.723 --> 32:38.490
I'M SORRY.

32:38.524 --> 32:40.126
THE MORE PEOPLE
YOU'RE EXPOSED TO,

32:40.159 --> 32:42.028
THE GREATER CHANCE
OF INFECTION.

32:44.396 --> 32:46.432
I'M SCARED.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.267
I KNOW.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.735
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING
THAT WE CAN.

32:49.768 --> 32:52.604
CESAR WILL BE
WITH YOU SOON.

32:52.638 --> 32:55.041
DR. FOREMAN,
YOU SHOULD LOOK AT THIS.

32:56.408 --> 32:57.676
WHAT IS IT?

32:57.709 --> 32:59.211
YOU FEELING ANY PAIN
IN YOUR PELVIC REGION?

32:59.245 --> 33:01.680
NO, WHY?

33:01.713 --> 33:03.982
YOUR GENITALS...
THEY'RE ENGORGED.

33:11.757 --> 33:14.326
I DRINK ANY MORE,
I'M GONNA EXPLODE.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.361
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO EXPLODE.

33:15.394 --> 33:16.728
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE A SEIZURE,

33:16.762 --> 33:19.298
WHICH WILL PROVE THAT
YOUR KIDNEYS ARE NOT WORKING,

33:19.331 --> 33:22.101
WHICH WILL ALSO PROVE THAT THEY
WEREN'T WORKING SATURDAY NIGHT.

33:22.134 --> 33:24.670
THAT'S WHY A GLANCING
BODY BLOW

33:24.703 --> 33:26.438
SENT YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE
INTO THE TOILET

33:26.472 --> 33:31.610
AND YOU ONTO THE CANVAS.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.612
HOW MANY BOTTLES
IS THIS SUPPOSED TO TAKE?

33:33.645 --> 33:34.780
SIX.

33:34.813 --> 33:36.715
AND I'VE DRANK HOW MANY?

33:36.748 --> 33:39.551
EIGHT.

33:39.585 --> 33:40.786
IT'S NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE.

33:40.819 --> 33:41.553
SO IN OTHER WORDS,

33:41.587 --> 33:43.255
NOTHING'S GONNA
PROVE YOU WRONG.

33:43.289 --> 33:45.524
YOU'RE JUST GONNA KEEP
MAKING ME MISERABLE

33:45.557 --> 33:46.558
BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO MISERABLE--

33:46.592 --> 33:49.528
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

33:49.561 --> 33:52.398
NO, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA HIT ME...

33:52.431 --> 33:54.733
'CAUSE SOMEWHERE DEEP IN THAT
WAY-TOO-THIN SKULL OF YOURS

33:54.766 --> 33:57.103
YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE
FULL OF CRAP.

33:57.136 --> 33:58.637
THAT'S WHY YOU STOPPED
JOGGING FOR ME.

33:58.670 --> 34:01.140
THAT'S WHY YOU DRANK
EIGHT BOTTLES.

34:01.173 --> 34:02.774
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH YOU WANT
TO THINK THAT I'M WRONG

34:02.808 --> 34:05.577
'CAUSE IT'S SIMPLER,
YOU ALSO DESPERATELY WANT ME

34:05.611 --> 34:07.213
TO BE RIGHT.

34:11.783 --> 34:14.220
I'M ONLY AN ASS FOR BUILDING
YOUR HOPES UP IF I'M WRONG.

34:16.655 --> 34:18.757
LAST ONE.

34:36.342 --> 34:40.546
YOU'RE AN ASS.

34:54.160 --> 34:55.527
YOU WERE WRONG.

34:55.561 --> 34:56.862
IT'S NOT THE END
OF THE WORLD.

35:00.532 --> 35:05.204
ANYTHING ELSE
YOU WANT TO SAY?

35:05.237 --> 35:06.305
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

35:06.338 --> 35:08.474
I THINK IF YOU
SERIOUSLY LOOK

35:08.507 --> 35:12.244
AT EVERYTHING THAT--

35:12.278 --> 35:14.746
ANYTHING ELSE?

35:14.780 --> 35:16.615
OKAY, LOOK, THIS ISN'T--

35:16.648 --> 35:18.750
OKAY! OKAY!
OKAY! OKAY!

35:18.784 --> 35:22.388
NO...I DON'T.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.223
JUST GET OUT OF HERE.

35:24.256 --> 35:25.691
GO HOME.
WE'LL TALK LATER.

35:25.724 --> 35:28.360
SOMEPLACE WITHOUT
ANY OF MY STUFF.

35:28.394 --> 35:29.728
NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT.

35:29.761 --> 35:32.764
THAT WAS MY POINT.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.208
(Chase)
INFLAMMATION OF THE GENITALS

35:42.241 --> 35:43.141
MEANS WE WERE WRONG.

35:43.175 --> 35:44.476
THANKS FOR THE STATEMENT
OF THE OBVIOUS.

35:44.510 --> 35:45.577
YOU'D THINK SO,
WOULDN'T YOU?

35:45.611 --> 35:47.579
FOREMAN WANTS TO KEEP SHOOTING
FOR RADIATION POISONING.

35:47.613 --> 35:48.747
BECAUSE THE SEIZURE'S
HAVE STOPPED.

35:48.780 --> 35:49.815
BECAUSE HER FEVER'S GONE AWAY.

35:49.848 --> 35:51.683
BECAUSE SHE'S IMPROVED.
BY LUCK.

35:51.717 --> 35:53.452
I DON'T THINK
THE PATIENT CARES.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.387
YES, SHE'S GONNA DIE
IN CONSIDERABLY LESS DISCOMFORT

35:55.421 --> 35:56.655
THANKS TO YOU TREATING
A FEW OF THE SYMPTOMS

35:56.688 --> 35:57.956
INSTEAD OF THE DISEASE.

35:57.989 --> 36:01.227
I PAGED HO--
(all)
SHUT UP.

36:01.260 --> 36:02.594
YOU'RE DRUNK.

36:02.628 --> 36:05.264
WELL, WHOSE FAULT IS THAT?

36:05.297 --> 36:06.798
GIVE ME ANOTHER SCOTCH.

36:06.832 --> 36:10.736
I CAN'T SERVE YOU.

36:10.769 --> 36:12.338
THIS 'CAUSE I'M BLACK?

36:12.371 --> 36:14.306
'CAUSE I'M NOT, SO...

36:14.340 --> 36:16.575
COME ON, BUDDY.

36:16.608 --> 36:17.709
LOOK, YOU CAN'T GET ME DRUNK
AND THEN GIVE ME CRAP

36:17.743 --> 36:18.677
FOR BEING DRUNK.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.879
THAT'S LIKE
DUMPING SOMEONE

36:20.912 --> 36:22.514
AND THEN GIVING THEM CRAP
FOR BEING UPSET.

36:22.548 --> 36:23.715
THAT'S JUST NOT DECENT.

36:27.853 --> 36:30.322
LET ME EXPLAIN
WHY PEOPLE COME HERE.

36:30.356 --> 36:32.858
THEY COME HERE TO DRINK.

36:32.891 --> 36:35.594
WHICH CAUSES US TO ASK,
WHY DO PEOPLE DRINK?

36:35.627 --> 36:38.264
HMM?
IS IT SUSTENANCE?

36:39.765 --> 36:42.200
NO.
IS IT TASTE?

36:44.703 --> 36:45.604
NO.
DON'T BE A JERK.

36:45.637 --> 36:48.974
IS IT THE COMPANY
OF STOUT-HEARTED MEN?

36:49.007 --> 36:50.542
I DON'T THINK SO.

36:50.576 --> 36:53.712
IS IT KILLING PAIN?

36:53.745 --> 36:55.581
YES.

36:55.614 --> 36:59.318
7 1/2% LIFE DULLER.

36:59.351 --> 37:00.786
THAT'S THE BUSINESS YOU'RE IN.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.854
YOU'RE IN THE "SCREW THE WORLD"
BUSINESS.

37:02.888 --> 37:06.392
YOU'RE IN THE
"REALITY SUCKS

37:06.425 --> 37:08.960
AND FANTASY TEMPORARILY APPEARS
TO NOT SUCK" BUSINESS.

37:08.994 --> 37:11.930
JUST GET THE MORON A DRINK
SO HE'LL SHUT THE HELL UP.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.868
NO.

37:16.902 --> 37:20.005
I'M GIVING YOU YOUR DRINK.
HAVE YOU NO PRIDE?

37:20.038 --> 37:24.310
EITHER SERVING ME IS A GOOD IDEA
OR IT'S A BAD IDEA.

37:24.343 --> 37:25.644
SHUTTING ME UP
IS A CRAPPY REASON

37:25.677 --> 37:28.447
FOR COMPROMISING
WHAT YOU BELIEVE.

37:28.480 --> 37:29.548
NOT EVEN AN EFFECTIVE ONE
APPARENTLY.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.691
AM I GONNA HAVE TO HIT HIM?

37:39.725 --> 37:42.528
NOT A GOOD IDEA.

37:42.561 --> 37:44.796
BUT WHAT IF IT'S
THE RIGHT THING TO DO?

37:44.830 --> 37:49.668
COMPROMISE IS NEVER
THE ANSWER.

37:49.701 --> 37:51.803
STAND UP.

37:54.940 --> 37:58.610
I WILL ALLOW YOU
TO THROW THE FIRST PUNCH.

37:58.644 --> 37:59.611
SIT DOWN.

37:59.645 --> 38:00.979
I'M NOT GONNA HIT YOU.

38:01.012 --> 38:03.515
JUST AS WELL,
'CAUSE I WAS LYING.

38:10.756 --> 38:11.757
[grunts]

38:18.830 --> 38:21.099
(Thirteen)
YOU CAN RELAX.

38:21.132 --> 38:22.734
SHE'S GETTING BETTER?

38:22.768 --> 38:25.637
BAD NEWS IS, BECAUSE
OF YOUR EXTENDED EXPOSURE TO HER

38:25.671 --> 38:26.938
AND HER WORKPLACE,
WE'RE GONNA NEED

38:26.972 --> 38:27.939
TO TREAT YOU AS WELL.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.708
I FEEL FINE.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.543
UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S THE WAY
IT CAN BE WITH RADIATION.

38:31.577 --> 38:33.712
NO SYMPTOMS UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE
TO DO ANYTHING.

38:33.745 --> 38:34.880
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT.

38:34.913 --> 38:37.082
[chuckles]
NO.

38:37.115 --> 38:38.550
A MARROW TRANSPLANT DOES
LEAVE YOU EXPOSED

38:38.584 --> 38:39.751
TO ALL SORTS
OF ILLNESSES,

38:39.785 --> 38:40.886
BUT THERE REALLY IS
NO CHOICE HERE.

38:40.919 --> 38:42.788
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
RADIATION POISONING.

38:42.821 --> 38:43.789
SHE'S GETTING BETTER.

38:43.822 --> 38:44.790
WE NEED TO START
YOUR TREATMENT

38:44.823 --> 38:45.791
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.993
NO.

38:51.029 --> 38:52.731
YOU'RE EITHER SUICIDAL

38:52.764 --> 38:56.768
OR YOU KNOW WE'RE WRONG.

38:56.802 --> 38:57.836
AND THE ONLY WAY YOU COULD
KNOW FOR SURE

38:57.869 --> 39:00.005
WHAT WASN'T KILLING HER IS
IF YOU KNEW WHAT WAS.

39:00.038 --> 39:02.741
AND YOU DO,
DON'T YOU?

39:02.774 --> 39:04.543
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN
POISONING HER

39:04.576 --> 39:05.677
AND THE REASON
SHE'S GETTING BETTER

39:05.711 --> 39:07.413
IS BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN NEAR HER.

39:07.446 --> 39:08.914
OUR CO-WORKERS ARE
ON THEIR WAY

39:08.947 --> 39:11.450
TO YOUR HOME RIGHT NOW
TO SEARCH FOR POISONS.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.385
YOU MIND SAVING THEM
THE TROUBLE?

39:13.419 --> 39:15.454
ATTEMPTED MURDER
IS BETTER THAN MURDER.

39:50.456 --> 39:53.459

40:00.899 --> 40:03.802
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

40:03.835 --> 40:05.604
TRAINING FOR MY BIG FIGHT.

40:05.637 --> 40:06.705
JUST NEED YOU TO--

40:06.738 --> 40:07.839
DRINK FIVE MORE BOTTLES?

40:07.873 --> 40:10.175
GET PUNCHED A FEW MORE TIMES?

40:10.208 --> 40:12.177
LOOK, JUST GET OUT
AND GIVE UP.

LOST YOUR BIG FIGHT.

40:21.487 --> 40:22.721
LOOK, I MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO TAKE A PUNCH,

40:22.754 --> 40:24.022
BUT I CAN STILL THROW ONE.

40:24.055 --> 40:26.792
THREE, TWO...

40:31.497 --> 40:35.100
WHAT A LOVELY DAY.

40:42.140 --> 40:45.110
WHERE'S CESAR?

40:45.143 --> 40:48.514
UM...IN JAIL.

40:50.882 --> 40:53.952
HE WAS TRYING TO KILL YOU.

40:53.985 --> 40:56.755
HE FOUND OUT
ABOUT YOU AND GLENN,

40:56.788 --> 40:58.657
WHICH, HE ADMITTED,
SHOULDN'T HAVE SURPRISED HIM

40:58.690 --> 41:01.827
SINCE HE STARTED SEEING YOU
WHILE YOU WERE DATING TONY.

41:01.860 --> 41:04.763
HE POISONED ME?

41:04.796 --> 41:08.266
REPEATEDLY...
WITH SPANISH FLY.

41:08.299 --> 41:10.802
THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT
CANTHARIDIN IS A POTENT TOXIN

41:10.836 --> 41:13.772
AND CAN CAUSE A LOT
OF THE SAME DAMAGE AS RADIATION.

41:17.108 --> 41:19.244
HE POISONED ME?

41:22.047 --> 41:25.050
I'M SORRY.

41:25.083 --> 41:30.155
HE HAD A SECURITY CLEARANCE.

Unseen Eye]

41:33.191 --> 41:34.159
AHEM!

41:34.192 --> 41:36.728
WHAT'S THIS?

41:36.762 --> 41:39.297
A PALM.

41:39.330 --> 41:42.133
HMM, USEFUL FOR
MANY THINGS.

41:42.167 --> 41:46.672
SLAPPING, GREASING, PROBABLY
SOME OTHER APPLICATIONS TOO.

41:46.705 --> 41:49.775
RIGHT NOW IT'S READY
FOR $50 AND HUMILIATION.

41:49.808 --> 41:52.544
HE WAS ACTUALLY SICK?

41:52.578 --> 41:53.645
HE WASN'T KNOCKED OUT
BY THE PUNCH.

41:53.679 --> 41:55.714
HE WAS KNOCKED OUT BY
THE CLINCH BEFORE THE PUNCH.

41:55.747 --> 41:58.283

OF THE NECK.

41:58.316 --> 42:00.185
