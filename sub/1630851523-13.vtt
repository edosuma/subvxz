WEBVTT

00:06.223 --> 00:08.660
<i>Wow, we really pulled</i> <i>
this place together.</i>

00:08.704 --> 00:10.314
Do you think Kenny
and Liz will like it?

00:10.358 --> 00:13.361
I hope so. And I hope Liz Grams
the hell out of this wedding

00:13.404 --> 00:15.189
for her 300,000 followers.

00:15.232 --> 00:16.842
Oh, I know I've made fun
of her social media,

00:16.886 --> 00:19.454
but now that it could help us
launch our bed-and-breakfast,

00:19.497 --> 00:22.109
<i>we</i> are the ones
who are #Blessed.

00:22.152 --> 00:23.327
Oh, this is lovely!

00:23.371 --> 00:25.590
I hope these nuptials
go better than mine.

00:25.634 --> 00:27.244
Elias arrived late, drunk,

00:27.288 --> 00:28.463
and smelling
of the maid's perfume.

00:28.506 --> 00:30.291
Hetty, why would
you marry that guy?

00:30.334 --> 00:31.857
My father needed to close
a land deal,

00:31.901 --> 00:33.555
and I was deemed
his most comely daughter.

00:33.598 --> 00:36.210
Damn Margaret and her mustache.
She dodged a bullet.

00:37.167 --> 00:38.473
Hey, you got a minute?

00:38.516 --> 00:40.170
Something I need you to see.

00:40.214 --> 00:41.563
Those are always
expensive words to hear.

00:41.606 --> 00:43.304
Oh, Mark, is it bad news?

00:43.347 --> 00:44.783
This could actually be
good news.

00:44.827 --> 00:47.134
Well, I'll bring a check
for five grand just in case.

00:47.177 --> 00:48.831
No need.
I have your card on file now.

00:48.874 --> 00:50.224
Great.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.139
So, I was doing some rewiring,

00:52.182 --> 00:54.489
and when I turned this sconce,
I heard a click from that wall.

00:54.532 --> 00:55.620
Check this out.

00:59.929 --> 01:02.497
And that's when I discovered
something behind this paneling.

01:02.540 --> 01:03.846
Is it a secret passageway?

01:03.889 --> 01:05.543
Don't toy
with my emotions, Mark.

01:05.587 --> 01:08.155
It's never a secret passageway.

01:08.198 --> 01:09.895
But in this case, it is.

01:09.939 --> 01:12.681
How about
- that mislead, babe?
- Mark's having fun.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.378
Oh! Oh!

01:16.206 --> 01:18.469
Did you know
- about this, Hetty?
- I did not!

01:18.513 --> 01:20.384
What is down the passageway?

01:20.428 --> 01:21.907
Oh, it's good.

01:25.520 --> 01:26.956
I don't understand.

01:26.999 --> 01:29.524
So, we just have a bank vault
under our house?

01:29.567 --> 01:31.700
Well, you said a robber baron
lived here, right?

01:31.743 --> 01:34.703
What? Babe, we
might be rich.

01:34.746 --> 01:36.879
Unless, of course,
this is a Geraldo situation.

01:36.922 --> 01:38.881
What is Geraldo?

01:38.924 --> 01:40.709
He was this news anchor

01:40.752 --> 01:41.971
who did
this live TV special

01:42.014 --> 01:43.842
where he opened up
Al Capone's vault.

01:43.886 --> 01:46.193
And inside? Bubkes.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.238
Don't get me started
on Al Capone.

01:48.282 --> 01:50.893
- That man was clingy.
- Can you open it?

01:50.936 --> 01:52.503
Think so.

01:52.547 --> 01:53.896
Course, it'll take a while.

01:53.939 --> 01:55.550
- Won't be cheap.
- Mark.

01:55.593 --> 01:57.029
Say the word. Card's on file.

01:58.379 --> 01:59.771
My crooked husband
must have built this

01:59.815 --> 02:01.251
to embezzle my riches.

02:01.295 --> 02:03.384
Hetty thinks there
might be riches inside.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.647
If this thing <i>is</i> filled
with gold coins,

02:05.690 --> 02:07.649
I am definitely gonna
Scrooge McDuck in 'em.

02:07.692 --> 02:09.912
Can one of you walk through the
door and see what's in there?

02:09.955 --> 02:12.610
I'll do it. A Pinecone Trooper's
- always up for an adventure.
- Mm.

02:13.916 --> 02:15.787
Oh!
- Peter!

02:15.831 --> 02:18.486
I've never seen
that happen before.

02:18.529 --> 02:19.791
Pete bounced
off the vault door.

02:19.835 --> 02:23.317
A surface that's
impenetrable to ghosts?

02:23.360 --> 02:25.754
I love it when the
mythology gets expanded.

02:25.797 --> 02:29.018
Puny Pete must not
be strong enough.

02:29.061 --> 02:31.412
Stand back.

02:34.632 --> 02:38.419
Well, this <i>is</i> mysterious.

02:44.425 --> 02:46.253
Hetty, do you have any idea

02:46.296 --> 02:47.732
what combination
Elias could have used?

02:47.776 --> 02:49.604
Oh, that's a good idea.

02:49.647 --> 02:52.781
Try 0603.

02:52.824 --> 02:55.262
- It was our anniversary.
- JAY:0603.

02:55.305 --> 02:57.786
[inhales, grunts] Oh, nope.
Okay.

02:57.829 --> 02:59.701
Fine. Uh, try 1101.

02:59.744 --> 03:00.919
1101?

03:00.963 --> 03:02.921
The maid's birthday.

03:02.965 --> 03:05.620
01.

03:06.795 --> 03:07.752
- Yes!
- Oh!

03:07.796 --> 03:09.754
Ah, that is heavy!

03:13.018 --> 03:14.324
Okay.

03:15.543 --> 03:16.718
Damn it!

03:16.761 --> 03:18.328
There's nothing in here.

03:18.372 --> 03:20.287
Aw. No riches.

03:20.330 --> 03:21.636
See, now picture this

03:21.679 --> 03:23.594
but with Geraldo having to vamp
for two hours.

03:25.117 --> 03:27.990
Sweet Lord, I'm finally free.

03:28.033 --> 03:30.819
Who are all you people? Hetty!

03:30.862 --> 03:33.778
Elias. How are you
not rotting in hell?

03:33.822 --> 03:35.780
Good to see you, too.

03:35.824 --> 03:38.305
The ghost of a robber baron
just popped out of our safe.

03:38.348 --> 03:39.871
Hey, where's
all your gold, man?

03:39.915 --> 03:42.004
Hi! I'm Pete. Nice to meet you.

03:42.047 --> 03:43.135
Welcome.

03:43.179 --> 03:45.573
Back, I guess. Welcome back.

03:45.616 --> 03:46.574
Oh, my God.

03:46.617 --> 03:49.316
- Is that...?!
- My corpse?

03:49.359 --> 03:51.100
It is. The only thing
that kept me company

03:51.143 --> 03:53.972
when I was locked in there
for the last 130 years.

03:54.016 --> 03:55.496
Not much of a talker, though.

03:56.888 --> 03:59.500
That must be Kenny
and Liz. I'll get it.

03:59.543 --> 04:00.849
Okay. I'll just stay in here

04:00.892 --> 04:02.633
with the corpse
and all the ghosts.

04:02.677 --> 04:04.331
I was kidding.
Sam, please slow down!

04:04.374 --> 04:05.636
Sam!

04:05.680 --> 04:08.378
So, this is where you've been
all this time?

04:08.422 --> 04:10.641
Yes. What did you think

04:10.685 --> 04:11.990
when I just disappeared?

04:12.034 --> 04:13.514
Didn't you search for me?

04:13.557 --> 04:15.080
You didn't tell anyone
about the vault.

04:15.124 --> 04:17.431
I assumed that you ran off
with one of your many floozies.

04:17.474 --> 04:19.737
No. The vault maker
locked me in here.

04:19.781 --> 04:22.044
- He left me to suffocate.
- Oh.

04:22.087 --> 04:23.393
His wife and I had grown close.

04:23.437 --> 04:25.526
- Oh, God.
- And when he finished the vault,

04:25.569 --> 04:26.788
there was a debate
over payment

04:26.831 --> 04:28.093
and the paternity
of his son, but...
Oh.

04:28.137 --> 04:30.792
Wait, all of you are ghosts?

04:30.835 --> 04:33.360
Yeah, bro. We've all died
on the property over the years.

04:33.403 --> 04:34.839
Most people go up,

04:34.883 --> 04:36.754
but we just stick around
- for some reason.
Hi.

04:36.798 --> 04:38.756
I am Thorfinn.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.454
I like herring and...

04:40.497 --> 04:44.022
Wonderful. Now,
how do-eth you, madam?

04:44.066 --> 04:45.633
Really?

04:45.676 --> 04:48.636
Mm-mm. Not happening.

04:49.724 --> 04:53.075
Hi! Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi!
Hi!

04:53.118 --> 04:57.079
Oh, I am so excited to be here.

04:57.122 --> 05:00.517
I can't believe
we're getting married tomorrow.

05:02.606 --> 05:04.913
Kenny, did you get that?

05:04.956 --> 05:06.523
Oh! Sorry, the
phone wasn't ready.

05:06.567 --> 05:08.438
Uh... Okay,
this is gonna be a big weekend

05:08.482 --> 05:10.179
for us, so I'm gonna need
you to have your phone

05:10.222 --> 05:11.746
- in your hand at all times, okay?
- Yeah.

05:11.789 --> 05:13.400
These two seem like a lot.

05:13.443 --> 05:14.749
Oh, so,
who's this little guy?

05:14.792 --> 05:16.054
Oh, this is Rooney,

05:16.098 --> 05:18.013
our rescue that we rescued.

05:18.056 --> 05:19.710
Oh, my God, Rooney.
I follow him.

05:19.754 --> 05:22.931
Uh, Rooney's got, like,
30,000 followers.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.062
What's a follower?

05:24.106 --> 05:25.934
Well, in the cult,
it referred to anyone

05:25.977 --> 05:28.110
who'd gotten the tattoo
and slept with Bruce.

05:28.153 --> 05:30.242
Are you guys gonna post
any pictures while you're here?

05:30.286 --> 05:33.507
Feel free to tag us.
#WoodstoneB&B.

05:33.550 --> 05:35.683
I absolutely will,

05:35.726 --> 05:37.119
just after the wedding.

05:37.162 --> 05:39.861
Actually on a short
social media vacay right now.

05:39.904 --> 05:40.862
It's part

05:40.905 --> 05:41.906
of a brand strategy

05:41.950 --> 05:43.168
to make sure that Liz

05:43.212 --> 05:44.822
seems more present for
life's big moments.

05:44.866 --> 05:46.041
Exactly.

05:46.084 --> 05:48.522
Because life
is about what happens

05:48.565 --> 05:50.698
when the cameras aren't rolling.

05:51.916 --> 05:54.092
- Kenny, did you get that?
- Oh, sorry.

05:54.136 --> 05:57.052
Damn it.
- Okay, we'll roll it back.
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

05:58.096 --> 05:59.924
I still can't believe

05:59.968 --> 06:01.056
I didn't ascend
into heaven.

06:01.099 --> 06:03.754
I paid the church.
There was a contract!

06:03.798 --> 06:06.757
Did you pay for me, too,
or was it just a solo trip?

06:06.801 --> 06:08.063
I was a little pinched
at the time.

06:08.106 --> 06:09.717
The mill workers had unionized,

06:09.760 --> 06:11.109
which I put down violently,

06:11.153 --> 06:12.981
but somebody had to pay
for that mob.

06:13.024 --> 06:14.286
That is not a great story.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.593
So, you're an actual robber baron.

06:16.637 --> 06:18.552
I mean, you're, like,
really rich, right?

06:18.595 --> 06:22.120
I ate meat several times a week.

06:22.164 --> 06:24.558
Well, it's not a Lamborghini,
but that's very cool.

06:24.601 --> 06:27.038
So, did anyone else from our day
stick around as a ghost?

06:27.082 --> 06:28.344
He's gonna ask
about the maid.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.260
Like, oh, I don't know,
say, the maid?

06:31.303 --> 06:32.957
Just to name someone
randomly.

06:33.001 --> 06:34.350
No, she's no longer here,

06:34.394 --> 06:35.873
you syphilitic reprobate.

06:35.917 --> 06:38.876
First off,
everybody fun had syphilis.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.835
And I don't appreciate
that tone.

06:40.878 --> 06:42.271
Well, then maybe you should go back

06:42.314 --> 06:44.229
down to your vault and talk
to your withered corpse.

06:44.273 --> 06:45.317
There it is again.

06:45.361 --> 06:47.276
What happened
to my obedient wife?

06:47.319 --> 06:50.366
Well, modern women don't
just defer to their husbands,

06:50.410 --> 06:52.586
Elias, and I have learned from
the living lady of the house

06:52.629 --> 06:54.239
that when she doesn't like
something, she says so.

06:54.283 --> 06:57.199
Like when Jay spent
$500 on action doll.

06:57.242 --> 06:58.853
Big mistake.

06:58.896 --> 07:01.899
That living lady
is a dangerous influence on you

07:01.943 --> 07:03.901
with her newfangled notions.

07:03.945 --> 07:06.600
She and Jay have simply opened my eyes.

07:06.643 --> 07:07.818
They have a
respectful marriage,

07:07.862 --> 07:09.603
and you were a terrible
husband, Elias.

07:09.646 --> 07:10.995
And my least
favorite cousin.

07:11.953 --> 07:14.956
I don't have to stand here and
listen to another word of this!

07:14.999 --> 07:18.263
Look, it's not important,
but how hot was this maid?

07:24.269 --> 07:27.142
What kind of servant
doesn't move out of the way?

07:32.016 --> 07:34.976
You want to go into that room
and have sex right now?

07:35.019 --> 07:36.281
I... What?

07:36.325 --> 07:39.415
I want you like I've
- never wanted anyone.
- Uh,

07:39.459 --> 07:43.201
sorry, I'm married. But that was
a much-needed confidence boost.

07:44.202 --> 07:45.943
What are you talking about?

07:45.987 --> 07:48.163
About you hitting on me
just now?

07:48.206 --> 07:49.947
You wish.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.865
Wow.

07:54.909 --> 07:57.041
And this is where
it all happens.

07:57.085 --> 08:00.001
Wow. The wedding planner
was raving

08:00.044 --> 08:02.003
about the heritage menu
you're doing.

08:02.046 --> 08:04.222
Now, I've never had squab.

08:04.266 --> 08:06.137
What's that like?

08:06.181 --> 08:09.010
I'd say it's like pigeon.
It's a lot like pigeon.

08:09.053 --> 08:10.925
Well, I'm really looking forward
to seeing

08:10.968 --> 08:12.796
what you come up with.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.364
Oh! Blast it, that hurt.

08:15.407 --> 08:17.279
Uh...

08:17.322 --> 08:19.020
are you okay?

08:19.063 --> 08:20.804
Yeah.

08:20.848 --> 08:24.329
I feel real good.

08:24.373 --> 08:25.766
Oh, great.

08:25.809 --> 08:27.463
Well,
I-I'll just show you the sauces.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.205
All I can think about
is grabbing your butt.

08:35.036 --> 08:37.821
What? What is it?
- What's going on, Jay?
- Okay.

08:37.865 --> 08:39.083
I don't know how
to tell you this.

08:40.345 --> 08:41.956
Liz hit on me.

08:41.999 --> 08:44.262
What?
- The bride?
- Oh, okay.

08:44.306 --> 08:45.916
Wait, what does that mean?

08:45.960 --> 08:48.571
- You don't believe me?
- No, it's just, are you sure

08:48.615 --> 08:50.530
this isn't, like,
an Olive Garden situation?

08:50.573 --> 08:52.532
Okay, that waitress
definitely hit on me.

08:52.575 --> 08:54.577
What is the Olive Garden?
It's a restaurant

08:54.621 --> 08:56.231
known for
its endless breadstick baskets.

08:56.274 --> 08:59.016
- Alberta and Sass are here.
- Oh, hey.

08:59.060 --> 09:01.889
Endless? How is
that even possible?

09:01.932 --> 09:03.499
Jay and I ate there
a couple months ago,

09:03.543 --> 09:05.588
and our waitress was refilling
our bread basket...

09:05.632 --> 09:07.547
Yeah, and then I said,
"No, thank you, or I'll eat

09:07.590 --> 09:11.246
'olive' them." Olive.
Olive Garden.

09:11.289 --> 09:12.900
Tonya laughed
for six straight minutes.

09:12.943 --> 09:14.249
Yeah, she works for tips, Jay.

09:14.292 --> 09:16.251
Hey, this is a victory for you.

09:16.294 --> 09:19.254
You have me.
You're living Tonya's dream.

09:19.297 --> 09:21.125
Okay, so,
what exactly did Liz say?

09:21.169 --> 09:24.346
She said all she could think
about was grabbing my butt.

09:24.389 --> 09:26.174
Mm. That little thing?

09:26.217 --> 09:28.916
Wait, seriously?
She <i>did</i> hit on you.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.265
Do we

09:30.308 --> 09:31.658
tell Kenny?
Because if we tell Kenny,

09:31.701 --> 09:34.051
then this wedding
probably gets called off, right?

09:34.095 --> 09:35.270
Liz was gonna post about it.

09:35.313 --> 09:36.619
This was gonna put us
on the map.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.316
But we got to tell him, right?

09:38.360 --> 09:39.666
Yes.

09:39.709 --> 09:42.973
Ugh, why do you have to be
so damn irresistible?

09:43.017 --> 09:45.323
Sorry. It's a curse.

09:45.367 --> 09:47.674
Hey, guys.

09:47.717 --> 09:50.285
What's wrong, Samantha?

09:50.328 --> 09:52.287
It has been a day.

09:52.330 --> 09:54.419
Tell me about it.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.465
I cannot believe
Elias is back.

09:56.508 --> 09:59.511
Till death do us part.
It's right in the vows.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.297
So, why'd you have
a bad day, Samantha?

10:02.340 --> 10:04.038
Well, the bride hit on Jay,

10:04.081 --> 10:06.127
and now Kenny's probably gonna
call the whole thing off.

10:06.170 --> 10:07.432
- What?
- Wait, seriously?

10:07.476 --> 10:09.173
Now she's not gonna post
pictures of the mansion,

10:09.217 --> 10:10.958
and we're not even gonna
get paid for the wedding.

10:11.001 --> 10:13.264
We're, like, this close to
defaulting on our loan.

10:13.308 --> 10:14.396
Samantha,

10:14.439 --> 10:15.527
what are you saying?

10:15.571 --> 10:17.617
Okay, I hadn't
told you guys,

10:17.660 --> 10:19.575
but if we don't start
making money soon,

10:19.619 --> 10:21.316
we could lose the house.

10:21.359 --> 10:24.536
No, you cannot leave us!

10:24.580 --> 10:26.408
Just when I finally learned
to look beyond the hideous pants

10:26.451 --> 10:29.063
and see the wonderful person
inside the hideous pants.

10:29.106 --> 10:31.195
You think I want to leave?
I don't know what to do.

10:31.239 --> 10:32.980
I have it. Solution.

10:33.023 --> 10:35.156
You and small man
kill yourselves.

10:35.199 --> 10:37.506
Become ghosts.
And then we are friends forever.

10:37.549 --> 10:39.334
But they might not
actually become ghosts.

10:39.377 --> 10:42.119
Right, that's the
problem with that plan.

10:42.163 --> 10:44.339
Hello, all. Get
your spatterdashes

10:44.382 --> 10:46.471
off my table. I
had it upholstered

10:46.515 --> 10:48.212
with the hide
of a white rhinoceros

10:48.256 --> 10:49.736
I shot in Kenya.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.694
Oh, my God.
Those are extinct now.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.740
Really? We got 'em all?
Bully for us.

10:53.783 --> 10:55.219
Man, he is evil.

10:55.263 --> 10:57.004
And I used to pillage
for a living.

10:57.047 --> 10:59.528
Oh! That thing ran

10:59.571 --> 11:02.749
through my leg. Skin that beast
and turn it into a table.

11:02.792 --> 11:04.707
Must everything
be a table?

11:04.751 --> 11:06.709
Well, he's

11:06.753 --> 11:09.016
really interested
in that teddy bear.

11:09.059 --> 11:11.235
Ah! Look at the little guy go.

11:11.279 --> 11:14.021
Good boy. Yes, use your hips.

11:14.064 --> 11:16.414
One walk through you and the dog
becomes a sex pervert.

11:16.458 --> 11:17.807
Can't say I'm surprised.

11:17.851 --> 11:21.376
Wait, Elias, did you walk
through any Livings today?

11:21.419 --> 11:23.334
Like the bride, to be specific?

11:23.378 --> 11:26.381
Yes, in fact, I did accidentally
happen through her. Why?

11:26.424 --> 11:28.557
That's it. That's
why Liz hit on Jay.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.212
Your ghost power is
that when people--

11:31.255 --> 11:32.343
or animals, apparently--

11:32.387 --> 11:34.345
walk through you,
they get horny.

11:34.389 --> 11:35.651
Really?

11:35.695 --> 11:37.174
Okay, I know he's
controversial,

11:37.218 --> 11:39.176
- but that's pretty cool.
- Yeah.

11:39.220 --> 11:40.569
It wasn't Liz's fault at all.

11:40.612 --> 11:42.223
She didn't mean to hit on Jay.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.225
I've got to stop
Jay telling Kenny.

11:44.268 --> 11:46.053
Well,

11:46.096 --> 11:47.489
I hope you're happy.

11:47.532 --> 11:49.491
You nearly ruined
this wedding.

11:49.534 --> 11:51.232
Those two
are hemorrhaging cash.

11:51.275 --> 11:52.624
They need this
to be a success.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.496
You're saying those Livings
need this wedding

11:54.539 --> 11:56.193
to go off without a hitch,

11:56.237 --> 11:57.325
otherwise they'll
be leaving?

11:57.368 --> 11:58.805
Yes, that's exactly
what I'm saying.

11:58.848 --> 12:00.632
Hmm.

12:00.676 --> 12:02.156
Why is he
literally twirling

12:02.199 --> 12:03.287
his mustache?

12:03.331 --> 12:05.115
It can't be good.

12:07.161 --> 12:08.597
Kenny, hey.

12:08.640 --> 12:11.078
I've been looking all over
- for you.
- What's up, buddy?

12:11.121 --> 12:12.819
I don't know how to say this.
Um...

12:12.862 --> 12:16.257
Okay, y-you know how I'm always
getting hit on by random women?

12:16.300 --> 12:18.346
Is this about
the Cheesecake Factory waitress?

12:18.389 --> 12:20.827
There's an entire factory
dedicated to cheesecake?

12:20.870 --> 12:23.525
It's as amazing as it sounds.
Wow.

12:23.568 --> 12:25.832
- No, it's not about her.
- You know, she probably writes

12:25.875 --> 12:27.442
"thank you"
with the little heart-shaped Os

12:27.485 --> 12:29.400
on every receipt.
She works for tips.

12:29.444 --> 12:32.403
Uh, Jay, can I just,
uh, grab you for a sec?

12:32.447 --> 12:34.449
Actually, Kenny and I
were just about to have

12:34.492 --> 12:37.278
- a difficult conversation.
- We were?

12:37.321 --> 12:39.802
Well, no difficult conversations
are needed,

12:39.846 --> 12:41.630
because everything
is actually okay.

12:41.673 --> 12:42.631
Oh, hey,

12:42.674 --> 12:43.806
it's the Monopoly guy.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.460
What are you
talking about, Sam?

12:45.503 --> 12:46.678
I'm talking
about the fact that...

12:46.722 --> 12:48.680
Criminy.

12:49.725 --> 12:50.857
Oh,

12:50.900 --> 12:52.728
what are you doing, man?

12:52.772 --> 12:53.773
Just spreading
a little love.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.644
Aw, that's sweet.

12:55.687 --> 12:58.212
You two are looking good.

12:58.255 --> 13:00.649
<i>Very</i> good.

13:00.692 --> 13:03.478
Jay? What's going on?

13:03.521 --> 13:04.914
I haven't seen Sam
this worked up

13:04.958 --> 13:07.308
since she saw
that movie <i>The Holiday</i> on TV.

13:07.351 --> 13:10.441
Sam?
Damnation!

13:10.485 --> 13:12.269
You can't just walk
through people.

13:12.313 --> 13:13.488
It's the greatest
pain there is.

13:13.531 --> 13:14.663
Well, actually...

13:14.706 --> 13:15.664
- Yes, yes, we know.
- Okay.

13:15.707 --> 13:17.709
Well, hello, you two.

13:18.754 --> 13:20.887
Did you leave the oven on?
Or is it just getting...

13:20.930 --> 13:22.671
hot in here?

13:22.714 --> 13:25.152
Well, enjoy the show.

13:25.195 --> 13:26.631
Hey, Kenny,

13:26.675 --> 13:28.633
didn't you say you didn't have
a bachelor party?

13:28.677 --> 13:32.202
Well, how about we have
a little party right here?

13:32.246 --> 13:33.900
- What?
- I could be Cameron Diaz,

13:33.943 --> 13:37.468
and you two could be
a couple of Jude Laws.

13:37.512 --> 13:38.730
Okay, that was not in the movie.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.167
What is that?

13:40.210 --> 13:41.690
Did you just meow at me?

13:41.733 --> 13:44.519
What are you doing?
What's going on?

13:44.562 --> 13:45.694
I don't think I'm tall enough
to be Jude Law.

13:45.737 --> 13:47.391
Liz. Liz. Liz!

13:48.436 --> 13:49.611
Oh.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.657
What happened?
I feel like I just blacked out.

13:52.701 --> 13:54.529
Me, too. I-I have
the strangest urge

13:54.572 --> 13:55.835
to watch a Nancy
Meyers movie.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.837
Kenny? What's happening?

13:57.880 --> 13:59.186
These two

13:59.229 --> 14:02.319
just propositioned
me for a threesome.

14:02.363 --> 14:03.625
They what?

14:03.668 --> 14:04.844
We what?

14:04.887 --> 14:06.497
It was Elias.

14:06.541 --> 14:07.977
Oh, God.

14:08.021 --> 14:10.197
Uh, there's got to be
some kind of misunderstanding.

14:10.240 --> 14:14.201
No. No. Uh, we did
proposition Kenny, actually.

14:14.244 --> 14:16.333
What?
Babe.

14:16.377 --> 14:17.900
As a test
of your faithfulness.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.294
And guess what. You passed.

14:20.337 --> 14:23.558
Yep, you passed. Flying colors.
I'm sorry,

14:23.601 --> 14:26.561
you two tried to have sex
with my Kenny

14:26.604 --> 14:28.389
the day before my wedding?

14:28.432 --> 14:29.912
No. No, God, no.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.914
Oh, my God, no,
I would not have sex with Kenny.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.394
But you guys

14:33.437 --> 14:35.787
should definitely have sex
with each other.

14:35.831 --> 14:38.312
Okay, this is too weird.

14:38.355 --> 14:41.881
Uh, disgusting. We will not be
having our wedding here.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.666
No, no, no, don't leave.
What about the squab?

14:44.709 --> 14:45.710
The squab!

14:50.541 --> 14:53.153
You know, a bake sale's
a quick way to earn some cash.

14:53.196 --> 14:55.982
O-Our troop once raised $78
in one week.

14:56.025 --> 14:58.288
- Thanks, Pete.
- What's happening?

14:58.332 --> 15:01.465
The ghosts are pitching ways
- for us to make money.
- That's sweet.

15:01.509 --> 15:03.685
Any viable ideas?
I have a plan.

15:03.728 --> 15:05.513
But it only works
if you have a tommy gun.

15:05.556 --> 15:06.949
Not really.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.733
Here's what you do.
You go to New York.

15:08.777 --> 15:10.735
You look up this guy I know.
He's gonna double your money.

15:10.779 --> 15:12.041
His name, Bernie Madoff.

15:12.085 --> 15:13.521
Miracle worker.

15:13.564 --> 15:15.871
I robbed a bank once,
if that helps.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.394
Did I ever tell you guys

15:17.438 --> 15:19.048
about that?

15:19.092 --> 15:20.528
I don't think we're gonna
get out of this mess, Sam.

15:20.571 --> 15:21.877
We're up to our
ears in debt.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.705
This house is
our only asset.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.837
I think we're gonna
have to sell.

15:25.881 --> 15:28.971
Aw, are the poors
gonna have to leave?

15:29.015 --> 15:30.712
That didn't take long.

15:30.755 --> 15:32.844
I'd tell you exactly how long,

15:32.888 --> 15:34.977
but unfortunately
this thing doesn't work anymore.

15:35.021 --> 15:37.414
You'd think, for $5,000,

15:37.458 --> 15:38.938
it would last
into the afterlife.

15:38.981 --> 15:42.550
You spent $5,000
on a watch?!

15:42.593 --> 15:44.117
Wait a minute.

15:44.160 --> 15:47.033
If Elias has that valuable
timepiece on his ghostly person,

15:47.076 --> 15:48.948
that must mean... The real watch

15:48.991 --> 15:50.601
must be on his corpse.

15:50.645 --> 15:52.560
What about a corpse?

15:52.603 --> 15:55.606
Babe, I need you
to do me a quick favor.

15:57.565 --> 15:59.915
Yeah, I don't think
I can do this.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.047
It's looking right at me.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.439
Babe, he's not
looking at you.

16:02.483 --> 16:04.528
His eyes are little,
withered husks.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.748
That is not having the calming
effect that you want it to.

16:06.791 --> 16:10.404
Okay.

16:10.447 --> 16:11.883
Oh.

16:11.927 --> 16:13.102
I know what pocket
he kept it in,

16:13.146 --> 16:15.975
but I confess,
I'm enjoying this.

16:17.063 --> 16:18.064
Guys?

16:18.107 --> 16:20.414
We got it.
Yes!

16:20.457 --> 16:23.504
All right! I bet that's worth a
pretty penny in today's dollars.

16:23.547 --> 16:24.635
Definitely enough
to keep the bank

16:24.679 --> 16:25.941
off our backs
for a few months.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.943
- Take that, bank.
- Yes, I'm sure the bank

16:27.987 --> 16:30.598
will be very hurt that you're
making timely payments.

16:30.641 --> 16:32.992
So, this means you're
- not selling the house?
No, Sass,

16:33.035 --> 16:34.819
we're staying.
We have a few more months

16:34.863 --> 16:36.038
to get the business
up and running.

16:36.082 --> 16:39.085
Well, I am
very happy about that.

16:39.128 --> 16:40.521
Oh, look, Elias,

16:40.564 --> 16:43.002
another opinion.
And nothing you can do about it.

16:43.045 --> 16:46.048
You think this is over?
That I'm just going to give up?

16:46.092 --> 16:47.789
As long as I'm here,

16:47.832 --> 16:48.964
they will never host a wedding

16:49.008 --> 16:50.966
that I don't turn
into an all-out orgy.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.881
So just normal wedding?

16:52.924 --> 16:54.796
And I won't stop there.
Whatever they host,

16:54.839 --> 16:56.537
I'll make it horny.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.539
Funeral? Horny.

16:58.582 --> 17:00.019
High tea? Horny.

17:00.062 --> 17:03.805
Baptism? Ravenous thrust-fest.

17:03.848 --> 17:05.546
Is this starting to sound good
to anybody else?

17:05.589 --> 17:06.895
Why are you doing this?

17:06.938 --> 17:08.897
Because I want
you Livings out of here.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.942
You have corrupted my Hetty.

17:10.986 --> 17:13.815
No! I haven't been corrupted.

17:13.858 --> 17:15.860
I have changed. A little.

17:15.904 --> 17:19.038
For the better, I think.
Let's be honest.

17:19.081 --> 17:21.866
Elias, you and I
were not good people.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.607
We stole. We exploited.

17:23.651 --> 17:25.827
We profited
off of others' misery.

17:25.870 --> 17:27.133
We did have fun.

17:27.176 --> 17:28.960
But while you were trapped
in that vault,

17:29.004 --> 17:30.832
I have been out here.

17:30.875 --> 17:33.052
Learning from these people.

17:33.095 --> 17:36.142
Learning from Alberta
to speak my mind

17:36.185 --> 17:37.534
and learning from Sam

17:37.578 --> 17:39.667
that the Irish are people, too,
apparently.

17:39.710 --> 17:41.843
She says it, but I don't think
- she believes it.
Yes,

17:41.886 --> 17:43.366
I complain about being here.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.890
And yes, I do want to be
sucked off more than anything.

17:45.934 --> 17:49.242
But these people have taught me
how to be a better Hetty.

17:49.285 --> 17:52.941
And I say there's hope
for you, too,

17:52.984 --> 17:54.551
Elias.

17:54.595 --> 17:56.031
You're here for eternity.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.512
Why not use it to change?

17:58.555 --> 18:01.776
I don't need to be
a better person.

18:01.819 --> 18:03.647
There is no good or evil.

18:03.691 --> 18:05.736
That's just a story
we tell ourselves.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.042
And I know better.

18:07.086 --> 18:10.045
So, Hetty,
get this through your tiny,

18:10.089 --> 18:13.179
inferior female brain.

18:13.222 --> 18:16.747
I will never change.

18:16.791 --> 18:20.229
Well, then, you can go to hell.

18:26.583 --> 18:27.715
Whoa!

18:27.758 --> 18:28.890
Oh, my God!

18:28.933 --> 18:30.283
He just went down on us.

18:30.326 --> 18:31.806
I didn't know
that could happen.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.547
Yeah, I don't love
having to worry about that.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.853
Did I... Did I just...?

18:35.897 --> 18:39.205
Is that my power, we think?
Banishing people to Hades?

18:39.248 --> 18:40.989
Or it was him just yelling
he was never gonna change

18:41.032 --> 18:42.773
and basically thumbing his nose
at the universe.

18:42.817 --> 18:44.079
That's another possibility.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.689
Well, we should try it out.

18:45.733 --> 18:46.690
Trevor, go to hell.

18:46.734 --> 18:48.910
Why?! Why?! Why?!

18:48.953 --> 18:51.217
Why?! Why would you pick me?!
What is wrong with you?!

18:51.260 --> 18:53.262
Guess not.

18:53.306 --> 18:56.613
- That was so scary.
- Oh, calm down.

19:01.618 --> 19:03.925
I mean, this is
just a big day

19:03.968 --> 19:05.187
in terms of ghost rules.

19:05.231 --> 19:06.493
So, the floor opens up,

19:06.536 --> 19:08.190
and this guy falls through
right in front of you?

19:08.234 --> 19:09.887
That's incredible.

19:09.931 --> 19:12.151
Well, Jay seems awfully gleeful
about this new horror

19:12.194 --> 19:13.282
we all have hanging
over our heads.

19:13.326 --> 19:14.936
You got to tell me
how it happened. I mean,

19:14.979 --> 19:16.981
was it hot? Was there screaming?

19:17.025 --> 19:18.505
Was country music playing?

19:18.548 --> 19:20.028
Well, there was screaming,

19:20.071 --> 19:22.596
but I'm pretty sure that
was just from our ghosts.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.946
Thor not scream.
Thor not scared

19:24.989 --> 19:27.340
of some silly hole
in the ground.

19:27.383 --> 19:29.603
Because Thor working
towards being better person.

19:29.646 --> 19:31.953
Very open to change.

19:31.996 --> 19:34.477
It all happened so fast. It was,
like, this red light, suddenly,

19:34.521 --> 19:35.870
and then whoosh.

19:35.913 --> 19:37.350
Mm! He went down on us.

19:37.393 --> 19:39.047
Alberta, I'm not sure
that's the best term...

19:39.090 --> 19:40.875
What? If that's
the term that she wants to use,

19:40.918 --> 19:42.224
then she can do it.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.095
Hello, all.

19:44.139 --> 19:46.097
I'm feeling in a good mood,

19:46.141 --> 19:49.623
so you may all remain
on this earthly plane tonight.

19:49.666 --> 19:51.407
So funny.

19:51.451 --> 19:54.149
Hetty just came in, joking about
trying to send Trevor to hell.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.151
Aw, too soon, Hetty.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.937
Trevor, I told you,
I knew it wasn't going to work.

19:59.981 --> 20:01.939
I don't actually have
that power.

20:01.983 --> 20:03.245
Or do I?

20:03.289 --> 20:05.073
Thorfinn, you're in my seat.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.206
Moving! Yes.

20:10.339 --> 20:12.428
<i>Wasn't comfortable there,</i> <i>
anyways.</i>
