55:47.376 --> 55:49.577
If I wasn't
an officer of the law,

55:49.579 --> 55:51.679
I would kill yöu right now.

Of course we can. Sure.

56:55.844 --> 56:58.980
Thanks, Uncle Frank.
That was so much fun.

56:58.982 --> 57:02.717

58:07.584 --> 58:10.084
And then Baxter got cancer,

58:10.719 --> 58:13.588
and I sold the house
to pay for his treatments.

58:13.590 --> 58:17.058
With the money left over,
I bought the center.

58:17.793 --> 58:20.294
Well, the kids absolutely
adore yöu there.

58:20.296 --> 58:23.030

58:31.139 --> 58:33.207

59:49.652 --> 59:50.952
They let Herrera go.

59:50.954 --> 59:53.020
- What?
- He's an untouchable.

59:53.022 --> 59:54.221
He's got
diplomatic immunity.

59:54.223 --> 59:59.760
yöu mean he can murder somebody,
deal drugs in our neighborhood,

59:59.762 --> 01:00:01.162
and they let him go?

01:00:01.164 --> 01:00:02.296
yöu got any real proof?

01:00:02.298 --> 01:00:05.066
Yeah. I saw it with my own eyes.
How could yöu let him go?

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:07.802

gonna go to jail.

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:17.044

It's a no-win.

01:06:56.746 --> 01:07:00.447
I know it's similar to
the "eye for an eye" thing,

more relatable.
