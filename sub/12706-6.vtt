00:01.201 --> 00:04.072
(crickets chirping)

00:06.740 --> 00:09.109
(indistinct chatter)
(laughs)

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
(panting)

00:25.559 --> 00:26.693
(snarls)

00:28.396 --> 00:29.429
(growls)

00:29.463 --> 00:30.698
Thanks for the relocate.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.899
I perform better
without an audience.

00:32.932 --> 00:34.468
(grunting)

00:38.939 --> 00:41.908
You were thinking, what, a
little helpless coed before bed?

00:41.942 --> 00:42.843
(growls)

00:42.875 --> 00:44.911
(grunting)

00:55.988 --> 00:59.226
You know very well,
you eat this late...

00:59.259 --> 01:01.195
you're gonna get heartburn.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.463
Get it?

01:02.496 --> 01:03.764
Heartburn?

01:06.099 --> 01:07.468
That's it?

01:07.501 --> 01:10.471
That's all I get?

01:10.504 --> 01:13.807
One lame-ass vamp
with no appreciation

01:13.840 --> 01:17.245
for my painstakingly
thought-out puns.

01:17.277 --> 01:20.248
I don't think the forces
of darkness are even trying.

01:20.281 --> 01:24.885
I mean, you could make
a little effort here, you know?

01:24.918 --> 01:27.920
Give me something
to work with.

01:31.525 --> 01:34.228
Watch your mouth, little girl.

01:34.262 --> 01:38.231
You should know better than
to tempt the fates that way.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.968
'Cause the big bad is back,

01:41.001 --> 01:43.170
and this time, it's...

01:43.204 --> 01:47.408
(zapping)
(shouting)

01:47.441 --> 01:49.843
(grunting)

01:54.448 --> 01:57.518
(wolf howling)

01:57.551 --> 01:59.652
*

02:50.170 --> 02:52.906
The Bronze is more fun
this year, isn't it?

02:52.939 --> 02:55.343
'Cause of the gloating
factor alone, you know?

02:55.376 --> 02:57.009
We're all about
college now.

02:57.043 --> 02:58.679
We've got heady
discourse.

02:58.711 --> 03:01.248
Yeah. Curfew-free nights and
mom and pop-less hootenanny.

03:01.282 --> 03:02.883
Coed dating prospects
who find

03:02.915 --> 03:05.519
townies sexy and dangerous.

03:07.788 --> 03:10.157
What? I can dream.

03:10.189 --> 03:12.325
Right.
So if college is so great,

03:12.360 --> 03:14.861
what are we doing here
and why is it more fun?

03:14.895 --> 03:16.864
Because the Bronze
is nice and-and familiar.

03:16.896 --> 03:19.098
It's like
a big comfy blanky.

03:19.132 --> 03:22.270
I was under the impression that
I was your big comfy blanky.

03:22.302 --> 03:25.004
Aw, you're
my-my person blanky.

03:25.038 --> 03:28.341
This is my place blanky.
Yeah, you know,

03:28.376 --> 03:30.743
with all the shock of the new,
it's nice to have one place

03:30.777 --> 03:32.280
that you can come back to

03:32.312 --> 03:34.114
and where everything's
predictable.

03:34.146 --> 03:35.848
Hello!

03:35.883 --> 03:37.617
Giles, trouble?
Oh. Oh, no, no, no, Buffy.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.387
Don't get up. No, no.
Nothing like that.

03:39.420 --> 03:42.355
No, I just... You know,
I thought I'd, um, drop by.

03:42.389 --> 03:46.058
Uh, latte, anyone?
On-on me?

03:48.562 --> 03:50.663
So much for your predictable
blanky theory, Will.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.435
Uh, sorry. Yes.

03:56.603 --> 03:58.406
Splendid.

03:58.438 --> 04:01.174
Well, it's ages
since I've been to a gig.

04:03.276 --> 04:05.312
Well,
don't look

04:05.346 --> 04:08.748
that way. I'm-I'm... down
with the new music.

04:08.782 --> 04:11.718
And I have the albums
to prove it.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.287
Yes, but it's
your cutting-edge 8-tracks

04:13.320 --> 04:15.122
that keep you ahead
of the scene.

04:15.155 --> 04:17.557
Don't scoff, gang. I've
seen Giles' collection.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.927
He was an animal
in his day.
Thank you.

04:19.959 --> 04:23.163
Hey, why not? If the Stones
can still keep rolling,

04:23.196 --> 04:24.932
why can't Giles?

04:24.964 --> 04:28.336
Exactly. I think it's brave
that you're here.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.937
Well, thank you, all.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.838
You've made me feel
right at home.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.408
Well, isn't home that empty
place you're trying to escape?

04:34.442 --> 04:38.579
(cheering and applause)

04:38.612 --> 04:43.350
* Dip a finger in me

04:43.384 --> 04:45.819
* Paste one more word...

04:45.853 --> 04:48.120
Oh, yeah.
Veruca's playing tonight.

04:48.154 --> 04:50.257
Yeah. Every Wednesday.
I told you.

04:50.290 --> 04:55.528
* Let me be distraction

04:55.562 --> 04:58.632
* Let me be a dream

04:58.665 --> 05:01.201
*

05:01.233 --> 05:02.636
* Let me...

05:02.670 --> 05:04.036
So, Oz, what about Dingoes?

05:04.071 --> 05:05.773
When are you guys here again?

05:05.805 --> 05:08.709
Oh, we're up next Friday.

05:08.742 --> 05:12.379
* Oh, oh

05:12.413 --> 05:16.182
* Dip a finger in me

05:16.216 --> 05:19.452
They're good, aren't they?

05:19.487 --> 05:22.723
Nothing special.

05:22.755 --> 05:24.557
Yeah, she's quelle Fiona.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.192
Color me bored.

05:26.225 --> 05:28.961
Really? I think she's
rather remarkable.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.399
Such presence for
someone her age.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.137
* I can feel you twist

05:37.170 --> 05:39.840
* I can feel you writhe

05:39.872 --> 05:45.478
* Because you're with me

05:45.512 --> 05:49.115
* Through a paper wall...

05:55.122 --> 05:57.090
(whimpers)

05:57.124 --> 05:59.526
It's in the sandblaster.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.961
(whimpering softly)

06:06.567 --> 06:09.903
What's in the sandblaster,
Will?

06:12.473 --> 06:14.040
(whimpers)

06:14.074 --> 06:16.043
It's a dream.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.612
Come back to me.

06:18.646 --> 06:21.081
Mmm...

06:24.050 --> 06:27.019
All Geminis to the
raspberry hats.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.423
And now you're faking.

06:29.456 --> 06:31.891
Am not.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.362
Just a little.

06:36.396 --> 06:40.033
Mmm.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.569
Morning.

06:41.601 --> 06:43.637
Morning.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.372
Bad dream?

06:45.404 --> 06:47.374
I guess.

06:47.406 --> 06:51.778
But the waking up part
makes up for it.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.481
It's always so busy
in there.

06:54.514 --> 06:57.485
Not always.

06:57.518 --> 07:01.822
A few things
shut my brain up completely.

07:01.855 --> 07:05.459
Anything
I can help you with?

07:07.026 --> 07:08.495
(groans)

07:08.528 --> 07:11.499
I got to get to class right now.
But...

07:11.531 --> 07:13.766
tonight for sure.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.769
I don't know about tonight,

07:15.802 --> 07:19.105
unless the extreme
Jerry Garcia look turns you on.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.574
Huh?

07:20.608 --> 07:22.408
Night before the full moon.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.411
Oh, that's right.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.146
And I have a thing.

07:26.178 --> 07:29.917
There's this Wicca group
on campus I wanted to check out.

07:29.949 --> 07:32.519
They have orientation on
the three nights you're wolfy.

07:32.552 --> 07:35.956
And it's probably
totally silly, but...

07:35.988 --> 07:37.356
No, go.

07:37.389 --> 07:39.158
Show 'em how it's done.

07:39.192 --> 07:41.629
Are you sure?
You can lock yourself up?

07:41.661 --> 07:43.930
It's only this one month.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.867
After orientation, they
meet on different nights.

07:46.899 --> 07:48.468
I'll be fine.

07:49.502 --> 07:51.303
Okay.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.273
As long as you don't mind.

07:53.305 --> 07:57.409
The only thing I mind is being
away from you for three nights.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.353
(birds chirping)

08:11.490 --> 08:13.160
Ms. Summers.

08:13.192 --> 08:15.394
I want you to prepare to lead
a discussion group

08:15.427 --> 08:17.163
next class on the paper topic.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.966
That was smart work.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.968
What do I have to do?

08:21.000 --> 08:22.302
If you have any questions,

08:22.334 --> 08:25.172
bring them up
with one of the T.A.s.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.341
(indistinct chatter)

08:29.375 --> 08:31.711
Are you okay? How'd you do?

08:33.245 --> 08:36.817
This is good. I-I mean,
this is excellent.

08:36.850 --> 08:41.221
You did better than me.
This is so unfair!

08:41.254 --> 08:44.725
You made me jealous
of you academically.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.226
Buffy!
(chuckles)

08:47.259 --> 08:49.229
I know. Can you believe it?

08:49.261 --> 08:53.332
Wow. I guess Professor Walsh
isn't so ogre-y after all.

08:53.365 --> 08:56.736
And she wants me to lead
a discussion group next class.

08:56.769 --> 08:58.905
That means more work, right?

08:58.938 --> 09:01.408
Shouldn't she have
a better reward system?

09:01.441 --> 09:02.842
You know, like a cookie

09:02.875 --> 09:05.445
or a toy surprise
like at the dentist?

09:05.477 --> 09:08.380
She wants you to lead
a discussion group?

09:08.414 --> 09:10.549
Okay. Jealous again.

09:10.583 --> 09:13.052
Jealous, jealous...
Okay, I'm back.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.054
Hey, I'm meeting
Oz at the cafe.

09:15.087 --> 09:16.556
You want to come?

09:16.590 --> 09:19.058
I'll buy you that
celebratory cookie.

09:19.091 --> 09:21.128
Great. I'm T.A.-bound
right now,

09:21.161 --> 09:24.264
and then I will catch up
with you guys.
Cool.

09:25.264 --> 09:27.234
(indistinct chatter)

09:35.241 --> 09:37.476
What are you gonna do,
sit on the ground?

09:37.509 --> 09:40.312
My girlfriend's coming.

09:40.346 --> 09:42.081
There's room.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.557
Big lunch.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.961
I like to eat.

09:53.994 --> 09:56.663
I hate chicks who are like,
"Does that have dressing on it?"

09:56.697 --> 09:58.831
Agreed.

10:00.332 --> 10:02.568
You guys were tight last night.

10:02.601 --> 10:04.303
I guess. The set's starting
to come together,

10:04.336 --> 10:05.773
but the amps still sound dirty
to me.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.875
What are you using, a 50 or 120?

10:16.283 --> 10:18.250
Hey.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.019
Hey.

10:20.052 --> 10:21.421
Hey.

10:21.453 --> 10:23.389
You want to sit down?

10:34.802 --> 10:36.803
So you should be using a 50.

10:36.836 --> 10:39.038
And Blue Voodoo,
not your best bet,

10:39.072 --> 10:40.506
unless you dig
the distort.

10:40.539 --> 10:42.109
Music talk, huh? Cool.

10:42.142 --> 10:45.879
I love to listen to Oz
talk about the biz.

10:45.913 --> 10:48.615
What do you like again?
I-I know you told me.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.551
Oh, there's a couple good ones.
The Johnson Mill...
The number one

10:51.584 --> 10:54.486
is Redbone.
Number one? No.
I got to go with Hound Dog.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.157
Me, too. That's a great song.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.625
I mean, Elvis. What a guy.

10:59.658 --> 11:01.494
You a big Elvis fan?

11:01.528 --> 11:05.065
The biggest. Well, I mean,
after Dingoes, of course.

11:05.097 --> 11:07.667
We're actually talking amps.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.736
But it's easy to get confused,
the names they give 'em.

11:09.769 --> 11:12.371
Oh.
(chuckles)

11:16.375 --> 11:18.577
You know, I got to bail.

11:18.610 --> 11:21.849
Um... I'll call you later.

11:31.958 --> 11:34.193
I should go, too.

11:34.226 --> 11:36.196
(chuckles)

11:36.229 --> 11:38.130
Good shirt.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.605
Check out the rapid exits.

11:45.638 --> 11:46.874
Was it me?

11:46.907 --> 11:50.677
Me. I don't speak Musician-ese.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.113
How come you didn't
tell me I look like

11:53.145 --> 11:55.048
a crazy birthday cake
in this shirt?

11:55.081 --> 11:57.350
I thought that was the point.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.385
He thinks she's sexy.

11:59.418 --> 12:01.053
He-he gets this
blushy thing

12:01.087 --> 12:04.057
going on behind his ears.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.692
That's for me only.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.927
It doesn't mean anything.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.929
So Oz checks out another girl.

12:09.962 --> 12:11.798
He loves you.

12:11.831 --> 12:13.801
I know. I-I know.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.635
And I don't want to be
the kind of girl who freaks

12:16.668 --> 12:19.807
every time my boyfriend
notices somebody else.

12:19.840 --> 12:23.576
I mean, I have wrong feelings
about other guys sometimes,

12:23.610 --> 12:28.248
but I-I feel guilty
and I flog and punish.

12:28.280 --> 12:32.085
Exactly. I'm sure Oz is flogging
and punishing himself.

12:32.119 --> 12:35.087
This is sounding wrong
before I even finish.

12:35.121 --> 12:38.758
Look, I promise you,
in a couple of days,

12:38.792 --> 12:40.726
it's gonna be like,
"Veruca who?"

12:40.759 --> 12:41.995
You think?

12:42.028 --> 12:43.831
Absolutely.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.732
Oz just isn't the type to stray.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.467
Not tonight, anyways.

12:48.500 --> 12:51.104
He'll be locked in a cage.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.341
(crow cawing)

13:05.184 --> 13:08.754
(crickets chirping)

13:08.788 --> 13:12.359
(growling)

13:27.307 --> 13:29.676
(crickets chirping)

13:34.514 --> 13:37.384
(rustling)

13:37.417 --> 13:39.019
Hello?

13:46.259 --> 13:48.227
(growling)
(screaming)

13:51.331 --> 13:52.631
(grunts)

13:52.664 --> 13:53.765
(snarling)

13:55.601 --> 13:57.636
(gasps)

13:57.669 --> 13:59.038
(growling)

14:00.206 --> 14:02.075
(screams)
(snarling)

14:02.109 --> 14:04.311
(panting):
Oh, God.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.147
(growling)

14:07.179 --> 14:08.414
(screaming)

14:08.447 --> 14:10.582
(snarling)

14:19.692 --> 14:22.062
(birds chirping)

14:46.885 --> 14:48.855
(chuckles)

14:48.888 --> 14:50.389
Morning.

14:50.423 --> 14:53.725
(grunts)

14:58.630 --> 15:03.035
(birds chirping)
(Veruca grunts)

15:03.070 --> 15:05.038
That was, um,

15:05.072 --> 15:07.106
some night.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.979
So it appears.

15:12.011 --> 15:14.480
Right. You don't remember.

15:16.783 --> 15:18.750
It's like that at first,
but then little bits and pieces,

15:18.784 --> 15:21.721
they'll start coming back
to you.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.124
So you're a...
Werewolf groupie.

15:24.157 --> 15:27.961
Nobody else gets it done for me.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.495
What?

15:29.528 --> 15:31.764
Kidding.

15:31.798 --> 15:34.366
You know what I am.

15:36.635 --> 15:40.240
You've known
since the first time you saw me.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.841
(chuckles)

15:42.875 --> 15:45.077
Now, you...

15:45.111 --> 15:48.081
need... to relax.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.917
Not a possibility.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.919
(sighs)

15:53.952 --> 15:58.158
So what do you want to do?

15:58.191 --> 16:00.659
(whirring)

16:00.692 --> 16:02.695
God!

16:02.729 --> 16:07.700
The kids in this dorm need
Fashion 101 in a big way.

16:07.734 --> 16:11.971
Or we could start
right here at home.

16:12.004 --> 16:14.807
Not making a statement.

16:14.841 --> 16:16.808
Just want to get back
to my place,

16:16.842 --> 16:18.811
figure out why we got out
of our cages.

16:18.845 --> 16:20.346
You have a cage?

16:21.380 --> 16:23.115
Don't you?

16:23.149 --> 16:26.052
Yeah. It has a little wheel
with a plastic ball

16:26.086 --> 16:27.354
and a cute
little bell

16:27.386 --> 16:29.355
in it.

16:29.389 --> 16:32.524
God, somebody's domesticated
the hell out of you.

16:32.558 --> 16:33.960
It's my choice.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.794
I don't want to hurt anybody.
Maybe.

16:35.827 --> 16:40.033
Or maybe you just don't want
to admit what happened to you.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.969
Maybe you just want to pretend
like you're a regular guy.

16:43.001 --> 16:44.803
Well, I am.

16:44.836 --> 16:46.873
I'm only a wolf
three nights a month.

16:46.905 --> 16:48.640
Or you're the wolf all the time,

16:48.674 --> 16:50.876
and this human face
is just your disguise.

16:50.909 --> 16:53.212
You ever think about that, Oz?

16:53.245 --> 16:55.148
I'm going.
I got to check the paper,

16:55.182 --> 16:56.649
see if we did any damage
last night.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.551
Oh, we did.

16:59.586 --> 17:02.989
But only to each other.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.723
I know some... part

17:04.757 --> 17:08.060
of you
remembers that.

17:08.095 --> 17:10.497
It doesn't take a full moon.
We could...

17:10.529 --> 17:13.464
do it again, right here.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.906
We aren't going to.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.741
This ends...

17:22.775 --> 17:24.009
right now.

17:24.041 --> 17:26.011
I can help you, Oz.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.913
You're scared. I was, too.

17:27.945 --> 17:29.682
But then I accepted it.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.085
The animal-- it's powerful.

17:32.118 --> 17:34.586
Inside me all the time.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.021
Soon, you just
start to feel sorry

17:36.055 --> 17:37.757
for everybody else

17:37.789 --> 17:39.358
because they don't know
what it's like

17:39.392 --> 17:41.461
to be as alive as we are.

17:42.494 --> 17:45.265
As free.

17:48.167 --> 17:51.738
Free to kill people?

17:51.770 --> 17:54.106
I won't do that.

17:54.141 --> 17:56.542
You shouldn't.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.378
You don't understand.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.713
But you will.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.817
You'll see
that we belong together.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.253
No.

18:07.287 --> 18:10.257
I know where I belong.

18:14.126 --> 18:16.163
See ya tonight.

18:18.330 --> 18:19.965
WALSH:
 Two of them.
 It was unbelievable.

18:19.999 --> 18:23.236
The fact that I survived
at all is a miracle.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.238
Excuse me.
Ms. Walsh?

18:25.271 --> 18:28.407
I hope you're careful when you
walk around campus after dark.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.676
I was attacked
by wild dogs last night.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.311
Wild dogs?
Two of 'em.

18:32.345 --> 18:35.315
Biggest things I've ever seen.
The first one was...

18:35.347 --> 18:37.183
Well, for a moment,
I thought it was a gorilla.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.185
Did you have a question, Buffy?

18:39.219 --> 18:40.619
No.

18:40.653 --> 18:43.756
No, I was just... sayin' howdy.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.192
Fine. See you
in class.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.267
(knocking)

18:54.300 --> 18:56.035
Yeah.

18:58.136 --> 19:00.173
Hey.
Hey.

19:00.207 --> 19:03.009
New look.

19:03.041 --> 19:05.444
You, too.

19:05.478 --> 19:10.217
Oh. Uh, laundry day
kind of came and went.

19:13.220 --> 19:16.256
Mmm.

19:19.259 --> 19:23.563
Hey. I'm sorry
if I was weird yesterday

19:23.596 --> 19:26.065
with you and Veruca.

19:26.097 --> 19:29.868
I didn't notice anything.

19:29.902 --> 19:32.137
Really? 'Cause...

19:32.171 --> 19:35.575
I felt all spazzy.

19:36.608 --> 19:38.377
No.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.813
Oh. Good.

19:40.846 --> 19:44.817
Guess it was just me worrying
for nothing again.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.220
Me and my busy head,

19:47.253 --> 19:50.557
always thinkin',
thinkin', thinkin'.

19:51.790 --> 19:54.594
Well, now you can stop.

19:54.626 --> 19:57.028
Everything's fine.

19:57.063 --> 20:00.833
Maybe you could
help me... stop.

20:00.866 --> 20:04.002
I'd really, really

20:04.036 --> 20:06.806
appreciate anything
you could do.

20:15.815 --> 20:18.049
What?

20:18.084 --> 20:19.519
What's wrong?

20:19.551 --> 20:22.954
I'm sorry. I...

20:25.424 --> 20:27.594
You don't want to?

20:27.626 --> 20:30.930
It's not that. I do. I just...

20:30.962 --> 20:32.932
I didn't get any sleep,

20:32.964 --> 20:35.201
I guess.

20:35.233 --> 20:37.202
I'm really
beat.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.872
Right.

20:39.905 --> 20:43.542
Busy wolf night. I get it.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.778
It's totally okay.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.881
Willow, you don't have to...

20:48.914 --> 20:52.484
No, I-I should.
I don't have much time.

20:52.519 --> 20:54.653
I'll see you later.

20:54.686 --> 20:57.123
(door shuts)

21:00.159 --> 21:02.961
HOST:
Treaty signed in 1648 that ended
the Thirty Years' War.

21:02.994 --> 21:04.463
Peace of Westphalia.

21:04.497 --> 21:07.467
CONTESTANT:
Um, Yalta?
Oh, you moron.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.236
HOST:
I'm sorry. That's incorrect.
That dinette set should be mine.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.904
We go to Janet
for a new category.
(knocking)

21:12.939 --> 21:14.941
Janet? Will it be...
Oh.

21:18.109 --> 21:20.579
Buffy. Excellent.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.348
Uh, come in.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.115
Hi.

21:24.150 --> 21:25.852
Can I get you
anything? Um, tea?

21:25.884 --> 21:27.354
I-I made a very interesting,

21:27.386 --> 21:29.821
um, moussaka last night,
if you're hungry.

21:29.855 --> 21:33.159
Pass on the tea.
And the... moose, thank you.

21:33.192 --> 21:34.861
You come on business, I hope?

21:34.894 --> 21:37.829
Yes. Lucky for you,
people may be in danger.

21:37.864 --> 21:41.667
I only meant, uh,
that-that I'm at the ready.

21:41.701 --> 21:43.935
Here's the deal.
One of my professors said

21:43.970 --> 21:47.339
that she was almost attacked
by two wild dogs last night.

21:47.374 --> 21:50.209
Under the light
of a nearly full moon.

21:50.241 --> 21:52.278
Werewolves. Two of them?

21:52.310 --> 21:53.445
Could be.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.280
Huh. Well, I-I've not seen,

21:55.314 --> 21:57.282
uh, anything about the attacks
in the newspapers

21:57.316 --> 21:59.285
or-or on the news.

21:59.317 --> 22:01.186
Uh, h-have you spoken with Oz?

22:01.220 --> 22:02.054
My next stop.

22:02.087 --> 22:03.823
Right. Get-get right on it.

22:03.855 --> 22:06.025
Uh, and I'll see
what I can find out.

22:06.057 --> 22:07.326
And you report back to me...

22:07.359 --> 22:09.362
ASAP. Promise.

22:16.568 --> 22:18.805
Hey, Will. Mom let you in?

22:18.837 --> 22:20.807
She seemed cranky.

22:20.839 --> 22:24.810
Yeah. We're having a little
landlord-tenant dispute,

22:24.844 --> 22:27.646
so I'm withholding rent.
An effective and--

22:27.680 --> 22:30.316
might I add--
thrifty tactic.
How come?

22:30.348 --> 22:32.317
She won't let me put a lock
on my door. I suspect

22:32.351 --> 22:35.320
she's afraid
I'll start having the sex.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.890
Yeah. Parents usually wait
till you're out of the house.

22:37.923 --> 22:38.724
Or under it.

22:38.758 --> 22:40.226
Or under it.

22:40.259 --> 22:43.162
To start worrying
about stuff like that.

22:43.194 --> 22:46.097
It's mostly too late.

22:46.132 --> 22:50.936
So, I know why I'm sitting
in a dank, sunless little room.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.005
But why you?

22:53.038 --> 22:55.074
Well, things with Oz are weird.

22:55.106 --> 22:57.509
And-and I talked
to Buffy about it,

22:57.544 --> 22:59.912
but I think we're
in Guyville here.

22:59.945 --> 23:03.082
I need a translator from
the "Y" side of things.

23:03.115 --> 23:04.916
Well, last time I checked,
I had the creds.

23:04.951 --> 23:06.952
Hit me.

23:09.556 --> 23:12.258
What does it mean
when a girl wants to...

23:12.290 --> 23:13.960
you know...

23:13.992 --> 23:15.561
If you're doin' it,

23:15.595 --> 23:18.130
I think you should be able
to say it.

23:18.163 --> 23:21.433
(sighs)
Make love.

23:21.468 --> 23:24.403
Wild monkey love
or tender Sarah McLachlan love?

23:24.436 --> 23:29.040
Any kind. But what if
the girl wants to and...

23:29.075 --> 23:30.876
and the guy doesn't?

23:30.910 --> 23:33.078
That's a bad sign, right?

23:33.112 --> 23:35.647
Could be.
Or the girl caught the guy

23:35.682 --> 23:37.282
in one
of the seven annual minutes

23:37.316 --> 23:40.552
he's legitimately
too preoccupied to... do it.

23:40.586 --> 23:43.589
Well, say the girl's
been noticing...

23:43.623 --> 23:46.459
Will, I've deciphered
your ingenious code.

23:46.492 --> 23:52.298
Okay. Say I've been noticing
Oz notice someone else.

23:52.330 --> 23:53.665
A woman.

23:53.700 --> 23:55.968
And is this chick noticing back?

23:56.001 --> 23:57.936
Most definitely.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.838
Well...

23:59.872 --> 24:01.840
have you asked Oz about it?

24:01.874 --> 24:03.843
Well, I-I thought about it,

24:03.875 --> 24:07.145
but then he'll think
I'm all jealous and worried.

24:07.179 --> 24:09.315
But you are.
And odds are, he feels it.

24:09.347 --> 24:12.218
I'll bet that's all there is to
the weird you're feeling.

24:13.519 --> 24:14.753
You guys should talk things out,
Will.

24:14.787 --> 24:15.855
You'll both feel better.

24:30.537 --> 24:32.939
Hey.

24:32.971 --> 24:34.707
Got out, huh?

24:34.740 --> 24:36.142
Yeah.

24:36.174 --> 24:37.844
Any news about attacks?

24:37.876 --> 24:39.878
No.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.713
Uh, but I did hear
about a woman

24:41.748 --> 24:44.182
being chased by two wild dogs.

24:44.215 --> 24:46.853
Two? Really?

24:46.885 --> 24:48.887
You don't remember anything
like that, do you?

24:49.922 --> 24:50.856
Another wolf?

24:50.890 --> 24:52.124
No. When the change comes,

24:52.157 --> 24:53.792
it's like... I'm gone.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.193
Total blackout.

24:55.227 --> 24:57.630
Well, if I find
werewolf number two out

24:57.663 --> 25:01.366
on patrol tonight, you might
have a roomie in there.

25:04.903 --> 25:06.638
Oz.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.074
Oz, are
you okay?

25:09.508 --> 25:11.309
And if it's possible,

25:11.343 --> 25:13.880
you seem
more monosyllabic than usual.

25:15.882 --> 25:18.217
I'm okay. Thanks.

25:20.286 --> 25:23.088
* I step out of

25:23.122 --> 25:27.259
* My skin

25:27.292 --> 25:32.898
* You wouldn't know me now

25:34.066 --> 25:39.538
* Couldn't you go away?

25:39.572 --> 25:42.540
* Shouldn't I?

25:42.575 --> 25:45.544
*

25:45.577 --> 25:47.747
* Leave me

25:47.779 --> 25:52.018
* The hard part

25:52.050 --> 25:57.455
* It's all I want

26:00.491 --> 26:04.496
* I need

26:07.566 --> 26:11.537
* I won't be

26:11.569 --> 26:15.942
* Your soft one

26:15.974 --> 26:21.814
* I won't be encircled

26:21.847 --> 26:26.885
* You might become

26:26.919 --> 26:33.092
* Something I need

26:37.096 --> 26:40.199
* To destroy.

26:43.201 --> 26:46.172
So this is
why you called me here?

26:46.204 --> 26:49.607
To see your Habitrail?

26:49.642 --> 26:51.609
(moans)

26:51.644 --> 26:54.846
Right before sunset,
I get a little buzzed, you know?

26:54.881 --> 26:57.182
Come here.

26:57.215 --> 26:59.786
I'm not getting
in that stupid cage with you,

26:59.818 --> 27:01.820
if that's what this
is all about.

27:01.854 --> 27:05.257
We belong
outside.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.960
You can't run loose tonight.

27:07.993 --> 27:10.596
And not just because
you might hurt somebody.

27:10.628 --> 27:12.597
I know
people that'll be out there,

27:12.631 --> 27:14.432
hunting for us.

27:14.465 --> 27:17.769
So you're saying I should spend
the whole night with you,

27:17.804 --> 27:21.640
alone, locked in a cage.

27:21.673 --> 27:24.711
You'll be safe.

27:24.743 --> 27:26.712
Not from you.

27:26.746 --> 27:32.151
Isn't that the point
of this cozy little arrangement?

27:32.183 --> 27:34.820
(inhales deeply)

27:34.854 --> 27:36.654
It's coming.

27:36.689 --> 27:39.224
Do you feel it?

27:39.258 --> 27:42.028
It's like blood boiling.

27:42.060 --> 27:44.363
I feel it.

27:44.395 --> 27:48.034
I've wanted you
even before I ever saw you.

27:48.067 --> 27:50.869
I sensed you.

27:50.903 --> 27:53.204
Did you sense me?

27:55.207 --> 27:56.909
Come in here.

27:56.942 --> 27:58.410
Did you?

28:08.586 --> 28:10.957
(snarling)

28:15.961 --> 28:18.396
(birds chirping)

28:43.555 --> 28:44.757
Willow...

28:44.790 --> 28:47.659
Oh, my God.

28:52.498 --> 28:55.401
Oh, my God.

28:55.433 --> 28:58.304
OZ:
I know what you saw.

28:58.336 --> 29:01.207
It wasn't...
(pants zipping)

29:01.240 --> 29:03.209
(beeping)

29:03.241 --> 29:05.211
I had to.
(click)

29:05.243 --> 29:08.314
I had to lock her in there
with me.

29:08.346 --> 29:09.816
I bet.

29:09.848 --> 29:13.719
She's like me. A wolf.

29:13.751 --> 29:17.155
Well, I knew you two
had a lot in common, but...

29:17.189 --> 29:18.324
(sighs)

29:18.356 --> 29:19.826
Don't touch me!

29:21.192 --> 29:23.962
OZ:
She was gonna hurt

29:23.996 --> 29:25.564
somebody.

29:25.596 --> 29:27.499
I didn't have a choice.

29:27.532 --> 29:29.134
But you did.

29:29.167 --> 29:31.237
Y-You could've told somebody.

29:31.269 --> 29:33.404
Your-your solution--

29:33.439 --> 29:37.076
just put you two together
in a room all night?

29:37.108 --> 29:39.411
Girl's got a point.

29:39.444 --> 29:41.447
Leave.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.848
I'm just saying...

29:42.882 --> 29:44.715
Now!

29:50.788 --> 29:53.759
I'm sorry.

29:53.791 --> 29:56.595
I knew.

29:56.627 --> 29:59.030
I knew, you jerk.

29:59.065 --> 30:01.166
(scoffs)
And...

30:01.200 --> 30:04.936
and you sat there and you-you
told me everything was fine?

30:04.971 --> 30:07.940
And that-that's as bad as...

30:07.973 --> 30:09.208
as...

30:09.240 --> 30:12.544
I know how it feels. I remember.

30:12.577 --> 30:14.212
Oh.

30:14.246 --> 30:17.316
So, what, this-this is payback?

30:17.348 --> 30:19.484
I-I had this coming?

30:19.518 --> 30:21.053
No. It's not...

30:21.086 --> 30:24.056
Because I thought
that was behind us.

30:24.089 --> 30:29.095
And-and, you know, what happened
with Xander, it doesn't compare.

30:30.328 --> 30:33.098
Not with what you and I had.

30:34.766 --> 30:37.368
Not with whatever
you've been doing with her.

30:37.403 --> 30:39.204
I don't know
what Veruca and I have done.

30:39.238 --> 30:41.207
When I change, it's like...

30:41.240 --> 30:44.643
it's like I'm gone
and the wolf takes over.

30:44.675 --> 30:46.545
But before this,

30:46.577 --> 30:50.048
when-when you were Regular Oz,

30:50.082 --> 30:53.885
you-you had feelings for her,
didn't you?

30:53.920 --> 30:55.487
No.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.088
I could sense something, but...

30:57.123 --> 30:59.191
But you wanted her.

30:59.224 --> 31:03.028
Like... in an animal way?

31:05.030 --> 31:09.268
Like... more than you wanted me?

31:17.442 --> 31:19.877
(birds chirping)

31:22.814 --> 31:25.384
*

31:38.896 --> 31:39.830
Willow!

31:41.567 --> 31:42.667
(horn honking)

31:44.736 --> 31:46.704
Willow, are you okay?

31:46.738 --> 31:49.607
Thank you.
I was too far away.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.943
It was lucky.
She almost got hit.

31:51.978 --> 31:53.612
Willow, what's the matter?

31:55.413 --> 31:56.982
Maybe you should take her home.

32:00.751 --> 32:04.256
Whatever it is, it's not
worth hurting yourself over.

32:04.289 --> 32:06.491
Thank you.

32:10.628 --> 32:13.432
I have to go.

32:13.464 --> 32:15.500
I have to find Veruca
before the sun sets.

32:16.867 --> 32:18.104
I will though.

32:18.136 --> 32:19.404
When I do, this thing stops.

32:19.438 --> 32:20.672
She's bad news.

32:25.443 --> 32:28.013
Do you want me to get you
something before I take off?

32:28.047 --> 32:30.249
K-Kleenex?

32:30.281 --> 32:33.019
Chocolaty... chocolate anything?

32:33.051 --> 32:35.421
No.

32:35.453 --> 32:38.257
I'll come back
as soon as this is finished.

32:38.289 --> 32:40.726
I just want you to take it easy,
okay?

32:42.560 --> 32:44.130
Riley was right.

32:44.163 --> 32:46.865
The main thing is put the blame
where it belongs.

32:46.897 --> 32:49.000
Don't hurt yourself.

32:49.035 --> 32:50.701
Okay.

32:50.736 --> 32:53.138
Okay.

32:53.172 --> 32:55.207
You're okay?

32:55.240 --> 32:56.708
I'm fine.

32:56.741 --> 32:58.477
I promise.

32:58.509 --> 33:00.046
I love you.

33:04.016 --> 33:05.217
(door opens)

33:05.250 --> 33:07.252
(door shuts)

33:09.255 --> 33:12.857
Put the blame where it belongs.

33:23.234 --> 33:25.203
So you haven't seen her around?

33:25.237 --> 33:29.040
Okay. Thanks, man.

33:29.075 --> 33:31.442
(door opens)

33:32.510 --> 33:35.247
Where is she?

33:35.280 --> 33:37.749
I don't know. I already checked
all the usual haunts.

33:37.782 --> 33:40.086
But I know
the areas we're drawn to.

33:40.118 --> 33:41.987
I'm pretty sure
I can follow her scent.

33:42.019 --> 33:44.323
We'll try that then.
Look,

33:44.355 --> 33:46.092
Buffy, you should know that...
Oz...

33:47.858 --> 33:50.261
...now might be a good time
for your trademark stoicism.

34:01.038 --> 34:04.009
I conjure thee by Barabbas,

34:04.041 --> 34:07.613
by Satanas, and the Devil.

34:07.645 --> 34:09.614
As thou art burning,

34:09.648 --> 34:13.918
let Oz and Veruca's
deceitful hearts be broken.

34:16.887 --> 34:19.257
(birds chirping)

34:24.130 --> 34:26.864
This way.

34:26.898 --> 34:30.268
I conjure thee
by the Saracen queen

34:30.302 --> 34:32.704
in the name of Hell.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.373
Let them find no love or solace.

34:35.407 --> 34:39.344
Let them find no peace as well.

34:44.315 --> 34:45.951
OZ:
She's near here.

34:45.983 --> 34:48.387
I can smell her.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.289
Or the dirty pile of clothing
she left on the ground.

34:51.322 --> 34:54.559
Well, they could be
from the other night when she...

34:54.592 --> 34:56.427
turned into a werewolf.

34:56.460 --> 35:00.266
Unless she wanted
to throw you off the scent.

35:00.298 --> 35:02.367
Willow.

35:08.106 --> 35:11.242
(panting)

35:11.277 --> 35:12.911
(grunts)

35:12.943 --> 35:15.146
Let this image seal his fate.

35:15.181 --> 35:16.648
Not to love,

35:16.681 --> 35:19.684
only hate.

35:30.996 --> 35:31.697
Wow.

35:33.798 --> 35:36.802
For a minute there, I thought
you might actually play rough.

35:37.902 --> 35:39.871
(lock clicks)

35:39.905 --> 35:41.706
Sometimes you have to,

35:41.739 --> 35:43.141
you know?

35:43.175 --> 35:45.610
To keep what's yours,

35:45.643 --> 35:47.978
sometimes you have to kill.

35:50.581 --> 35:53.985
How 'bout that?

35:54.018 --> 35:56.688
The sun's almost down.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.699
(grunting)

36:12.338 --> 36:14.239
(panting)

36:16.041 --> 36:17.675
Can't say I'm surprised
you didn't go through

36:17.708 --> 36:19.878
with your little hex.

36:19.911 --> 36:21.380
You don't have the teeth.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.382
You don't know what I have.

36:23.414 --> 36:25.884
You don't know
anything about me.

36:25.916 --> 36:27.719
I know what you love.

36:27.753 --> 36:30.489
I have
his scent on me

36:30.521 --> 36:32.157
right now.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.324
(panting)

36:33.358 --> 36:34.192
(grunting)

36:36.927 --> 36:39.197
Don't touch her again.

36:39.231 --> 36:41.099
Come stop me.

36:41.132 --> 36:42.900
I like it rough, remember?

36:44.936 --> 36:47.938
You want to hurt me, hurt me.

36:47.972 --> 36:49.206
You leave her out
of this.

36:49.240 --> 36:50.608
How can I?

36:50.641 --> 36:52.878
She's the reason
you're living in cages.

36:52.911 --> 36:54.945
She's
blinding you.

36:54.980 --> 36:58.817
When she's gone, you'll be able
to admit what you are.

37:01.753 --> 37:05.123
You don't want
to find out what I am.

37:05.155 --> 37:07.659
You're an animal.

37:11.396 --> 37:13.931
Animals kill.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.065
(snarling)

37:15.099 --> 37:16.402
(panting)

37:16.434 --> 37:18.235
You're right.

37:18.269 --> 37:20.606
We kill.

37:20.639 --> 37:22.239
(growling, grunting)

37:33.952 --> 37:36.487
(snarling)

37:51.469 --> 37:53.739
(whimpering)

37:53.771 --> 37:56.375
(growling)

38:01.146 --> 38:02.614
Oz?

38:02.648 --> 38:04.983
(growling)

38:05.016 --> 38:05.784
(gasps)

38:05.817 --> 38:06.784
(grunting)

38:15.193 --> 38:15.994
(whimpers)

38:17.161 --> 38:18.530
(snarls)

38:18.563 --> 38:20.130
(whimpers)

38:21.467 --> 38:22.668
(crying)

38:24.001 --> 38:25.135
(gun clatters)

38:29.474 --> 38:31.876
(sobbing)

38:43.253 --> 38:45.990
(birds chirping)

38:46.023 --> 38:48.827
(dog barking in distance)

38:48.860 --> 38:52.329
I'm not quite
sure I understand.

38:52.364 --> 38:55.400
There was just so much going on
with Oz and Willow.

38:55.434 --> 38:57.235
And there still is.

38:57.268 --> 38:59.003
But I-I just thought
you should know.

38:59.036 --> 39:00.405
Well, this fellow in the woods,

39:00.438 --> 39:03.041
he was in-in military garb?

39:03.074 --> 39:05.175
And he was toting
some serious weaponry.

39:05.210 --> 39:08.012
The thing is, I-I saw some guys
dressed exactly like him

39:08.045 --> 39:11.682
on Halloween night. I just
assumed they were in costume.

39:11.717 --> 39:13.818
But maybe they were working.

39:13.851 --> 39:15.320
I want to know what's up.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.155
The guy got in my way.

39:17.188 --> 39:20.157
I almost didn't catch up
with Oz in time.

39:20.190 --> 39:22.728
And as it was,
I was too late to...

39:22.760 --> 39:25.063
You saved Willow.

39:25.096 --> 39:27.898
Right now, she wishes I hadn't.

39:27.932 --> 39:32.237
Giles, I've never seen her
like this.

39:32.269 --> 39:34.873
It's like it hurts too much

39:34.905 --> 39:36.273
to form words.

39:36.306 --> 39:38.275
You've...

39:38.309 --> 39:39.710
you've felt that way yourself,

39:39.744 --> 39:42.047
and you got through it.
Yeah.

39:42.079 --> 39:45.784
I ran away and went to Hell
and then got through it.

39:45.817 --> 39:47.585
I'm kind of hoping

39:47.619 --> 39:48.853
she doesn't use me
as a model.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.521
Fair enough.

39:50.556 --> 39:54.391
I just don't know how
they're gonna deal with this.

39:56.795 --> 39:59.063
(knocking)

40:07.405 --> 40:10.909
Hello.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.244
Hi.

40:17.414 --> 40:20.751
What are you doing?

40:23.755 --> 40:25.757
I'm going.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.860
Now?

40:33.030 --> 40:34.965
That's your solution?

40:35.000 --> 40:37.568
That's my decision.

40:37.603 --> 40:40.806
Don't I get any say in this?

40:40.838 --> 40:42.273
No.

40:45.777 --> 40:49.447
Veruca was right
about something.

40:49.481 --> 40:51.148
The wolf

40:51.181 --> 40:54.152
is inside me all the time.

40:54.184 --> 40:59.456
And I don't know where that line
is anymore between me and it.

41:00.958 --> 41:04.496
And until I figure out
what that means...

41:04.530 --> 41:06.731
I shouldn't be around you.

41:08.833 --> 41:10.802
Or anybody.

41:10.835 --> 41:12.369
Well,
that could be

41:12.402 --> 41:15.373
a problem, 'cause people...

41:15.405 --> 41:19.978
kind of a planetary epidemic.

41:20.010 --> 41:23.213
I'll find someplace.

41:23.248 --> 41:26.684
Well, how long?

41:26.717 --> 41:29.353
I don't know.

41:30.387 --> 41:32.791
Oz...

41:32.824 --> 41:36.327
don't you love me?
(sniffles)

41:36.360 --> 41:39.329
My whole life...

41:39.364 --> 41:41.331
I've never loved anything else.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.373
(sobs)

41:49.407 --> 41:51.876
(shuddering exhale)

41:51.909 --> 41:55.512
Oz...

41:55.547 --> 41:59.751
Oh, God.

41:59.784 --> 42:01.485
Oz...
