23:35.580 --> 23:36.979

23:37.040 --> 23:38.769
We think the only way
we get out from under this

23:38.850 --> 23:41.774
is if the original author
comes out publicly

23:41.850 --> 23:43.112
and says the whole
thing was a hoax.

23:43.180 --> 23:44.909

would have to be

23:44.990 --> 23:47.015

as the fake story.

23:47.090 --> 23:48.057
That's impossible.

23:48.120 --> 23:49.712
Can you find out
who wrote it?

23:49.790 --> 23:51.883
Sure. I can try and
trace his IP address,

23:51.960 --> 23:54.622
but the dude's probably hiding
behind major layers

23:54.700 --> 23:56.224

23:56.300 --> 23:57.597
Yeah, okay, but it's doable?

23:57.670 --> 23:59.729

23:59.800 --> 24:01.529

let's make it happen.

the Phoenix Sentinel
website

down to this handle.

at other sites that used
that exact same handle

to this shell corporation.

from there,
it's easy.

Nick. Hi.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.198
Becca.
NICK: Nice to meet you, Becca.

32:52.270 --> 32:54.238
You as well.
Thank you, guys, for coming in.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.268
NICK: Our pleasure.
Thanks for having us.

32:56.340 --> 32:58.968
So sorry for bailing
the other day.

32:59.040 --> 33:01.577
Oh, hey, that's totally
understandable.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.779
We'd have probably
done the same thing.

33:03.840 --> 33:04.977
Yeah, we get it.

33:05.050 --> 33:06.506
Well, thank God
it got debunked, though.

33:06.580 --> 33:09.242
Tell me about it.
That Steve Brasik
guy's a creep.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.618
Yeah. Unfortunately,
there's still like,
a million other guys

33:11.690 --> 33:12.839
just like him out there.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.114
NICK: Gross.
MARA: That's true.

33:14.190 --> 33:15.714
WES: You know
what's not fake news?

33:16.920 --> 33:18.182
(EXHALES)

33:18.260 --> 33:20.785
You guys seem to be
in a lot of trouble.

33:20.860 --> 33:23.852
Um, more like
a PR problem.

33:23.930 --> 33:25.397
I mean, what happened?

33:25.470 --> 33:28.064
You were challenging
the big dogs.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.562
Facebook. Snapchat...

33:29.640 --> 33:31.130
We still have
a healthy share...

33:31.210 --> 33:33.030
You're not even part of
the conversation anymore.

33:33.110 --> 33:34.475
Nah, I wouldn't say that.

33:34.540 --> 33:37.805
Your stock is bleeding
like a 13-year-old girl.

33:37.880 --> 33:39.768
Now, your users, I mean,

33:39.850 --> 33:42.011
they think you're stealing
all their information

33:42.080 --> 33:43.911
selling it to the big
conglomerates.

33:43.980 --> 33:45.208
Because you are.

33:45.290 --> 33:46.689
Which, I mean, whatever. But

33:47.390 --> 33:49.483
don't get caught, right?

33:53.460 --> 33:58.796
Especially when you're touting
yourself as the new digital
Robin Hood.

34:01.500 --> 34:02.933
Look”.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.161
You're not wrong.

34:05.240 --> 34:09.574
Our CFO...
He went a little rogue,

34:09.640 --> 34:11.779
trying to position us
for our IPO.

34:11.850 --> 34:12.874
Whoops.

34:12.950 --> 34:14.144
Yeah, but, we're in a place...

34:14.220 --> 34:15.812
SUHIL: Look.

34:15.880 --> 34:18.440
Did you guys come here to pitch
us or just shit all over us?

34:18.520 --> 34:20.385
Now, I got a pretty
full day, so...

34:20.450 --> 34:21.986
PAIGE: Suhil.
What?

34:22.060 --> 34:24.153
Please.

34:24.230 --> 34:26.721
Screw this, right? I mean, what
are they gonna offer us that
Guizer already hasn't?

34:26.790 --> 34:28.257
Guizer?

34:28.330 --> 34:30.798
You guys are talking
to Alex Bell?

34:30.860 --> 34:34.239
So I take it that this is
more of a leverage meeting?

34:34.300 --> 34:35.562
PAIGE: No. No.
BECCA: No, look.

34:35.640 --> 34:37.733
I really like what you
guys are doing.

34:37.800 --> 34:38.835
It's friggin' rad.

34:38.910 --> 34:40.104
PAIGE: Yeah.

34:40.170 --> 34:41.398
Nothing is set
in stone, so we're...

34:41.480 --> 34:42.799
NICK: Okay, well,
that's good, Paige.

34:42.880 --> 34:45.144
That's really good
because I gotta tell you,

34:45.210 --> 34:48.418
people's opinions are not gonna
change of you just because you
team with Guizer.

34:48.480 --> 34:49.811
Especially not
when they find out

34:49.880 --> 34:52.519
that you've been stealing
from your own foundation.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.785
I'm sorry you lost your mom.
I lost mine the same way.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.715
But I didn't feel the need
to set up a cancer foundation

34:57.790 --> 35:00.122
to supplement some income.

35:01.330 --> 35:02.695
(WHISPERS) What are you doing?

35:04.670 --> 35:07.696
(SCOFFS) I have no idea
what you're talking about.

35:07.770 --> 35:08.794
NICK: N0?

35:08.870 --> 35:10.132
Okay. Maybe I got it wrong.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.633
It's possible I misread.

35:12.610 --> 35:13.668
Let me see.

35:14.910 --> 35:16.400
No. There it is.

35:17.310 --> 35:18.675
Yeah. It's right there.

35:24.850 --> 35:26.647
Where did you get this?

35:26.720 --> 35:30.554
Same place I found
your emails detailing
your affair with Suhil.

35:32.430 --> 35:34.318
Whoa. Hold on a sec.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.698
I have a question for you.
Did she know you were
taking those pictures?

35:36.760 --> 35:39.263
Because I definitely don't
think she knew
you were sending them

35:39.330 --> 35:40.866
to your buddy Josh
on the network team.

35:40.930 --> 35:42.488
You guys seriously...
NICK: Anyway, point is,

35:42.570 --> 35:45.061
there's a lot of
fun stuff on there,

35:45.140 --> 35:47.461
um, which we can
get into or not.

35:48.840 --> 35:49.932
(SCOFFS)

35:50.010 --> 35:51.409
(EXHALES)

35:51.480 --> 35:52.947
This is blackmail.

35:53.010 --> 35:54.978
No... no, it isn't.

35:55.050 --> 35:58.486
Blackmail? I'm just telling you
this in the interest of full
transparency.

35:59.150 --> 36:00.981
And if, in turn,

36:01.050 --> 36:05.623
my truthfulness caused
you to go to Araknet
instead of Guizer, well,

36:05.690 --> 36:07.578
it's just a boon to everyone.

37:03.150 --> 37:06.347
I just got an email
that said they're gonna
migrate their users

37:06.420 --> 37:08.012
to our network
within the week.

37:08.090 --> 37:09.978
Oh, snap!

37:10.060 --> 37:13.826
I'm gonna put Rance's team
in touch with Suhil.

37:13.890 --> 37:16.029
If he's still
working for 'em.

37:16.100 --> 37:17.556
Yeah. If he's still alive.

37:19.400 --> 37:22.938
We should also put together
a little press release.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.400
Yeah, I'm already on it.

37:29.110 --> 37:30.372
You slayed it, brotha.

37:30.440 --> 37:32.340
Hey, thank you.

37:32.410 --> 37:34.571
It was mostly Izzy,
but I'll take it.

37:34.650 --> 37:36.379
Take it.
Was it mostly Izzy?

37:36.450 --> 37:37.940
You're right. I slayed 'em.

37:38.020 --> 37:39.612
You did.
Thank you.

37:39.690 --> 37:40.714
I did it.

37:42.460 --> 37:44.382
I'm gonna make a quick call.
Yeah.

37:51.060 --> 37:52.197
Feelin' good?

37:52.270 --> 37:53.919
Yeah. Super.

37:56.300 --> 37:57.938
You were _
really somethln'.

38:22.360 --> 38:23.759
WOMAN: Hello?

38:23.830 --> 38:25.593
Hi.

38:25.670 --> 38:29.333
Wesley, you woke me.
What time is it there?

38:29.400 --> 38:30.731
Well, actually,

38:30.800 --> 38:33.007
I'm on the West Coast
tonIght, so

38:34.170 --> 38:35.501
it's even earlier.

38:37.080 --> 38:38.069
(GROANS)

38:42.180 --> 38:43.477
I miss you.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.049
WES: When are you
gonna be Stateside?

38:57.130 --> 38:58.529
WOMAN: I don't know.

39:00.130 --> 39:01.768
WES: I'll come see you.

39:06.410 --> 39:08.435
I need you to get
behind me.
Yeah.

39:12.410 --> 39:13.672
(MOANING)

39:17.480 --> 39:19.948
WOMAN: How is my Mara?

39:22.560 --> 39:24.187
She's amazing.

39:24.260 --> 39:25.522
She's...

39:25.590 --> 39:27.285
MARA: Pull my hair.

39:27.360 --> 39:29.089
What?
Pull my hair.

39:31.330 --> 39:32.661
Pull my hair harder.

39:32.730 --> 39:35.198
Harder, yeah. Like that.
Yeah?

39:35.270 --> 39:36.430
You can do it harder.

39:36.500 --> 39:38.092
WES: She's so beautiful.

39:38.170 --> 39:40.934
She reminds me of you
when we first met.

39:41.780 --> 39:42.906
Harder.

39:45.980 --> 39:47.447
Pull my hair harder.

39:47.510 --> 39:49.011
Harder, please.

39:49.080 --> 39:50.240
Harder.

39:50.320 --> 39:51.582
Hurt me.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.142
Like this?
Like that.

39:54.220 --> 39:56.450
Don't stop.

40:00.060 --> 40:01.129
Yeah, like that.

40:01.190 --> 40:02.498
Yeah, like that.

40:03.130 --> 40:04.495
(MOANING)

40:21.650 --> 40:23.709
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)

40:26.650 --> 40:28.049
Are you okay?

40:31.360 --> 40:32.588
I'm sorry.

40:33.290 --> 40:34.518
I'm sorry.

40:39.270 --> 40:40.623
Are you okay?

40:42.940 --> 40:44.134
I love you.

40:46.140 --> 40:50.679
WOMAN: Get some sleep.
I'll talk with you soon.
