11:42.100 --> 11:44.193
BLAME.

11:55.780 --> 11:57.600
IS IT YOUR INTENT TO ROB ME

11:57.650 --> 11:59.914
OF MY REMAINING FAITH IN YOU,
REVEREND?

11:59.950 --> 12:02.714
Cotton: MRS. SIBLEY.
I DIDN'T HEAR YOU ARRIVE.

12:02.750 --> 12:05.082
Mary: YOUR CHARGE,
SIMPLE AND CLEAR,

12:05.120 --> 12:07.953
IS TO PROTECT THE LEWIS GIRL
FROM FURTHER POSSESSION.

12:07.990 --> 12:10.857
AND YET...WAS THE EPISODE
IN THE MARKETPLACE

12:10.890 --> 12:12.448
NOT EVIDENCE OF EXACTLY THAT?

12:12.490 --> 12:15.391
Cotton: WE HAVE NO PROOF
IT WAS THE WORK OF WITCHES.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.261
Mary: SO YOU'VE
PAID HER A VISIT, THEN?

12:17.300 --> 12:19.393
YOU'VE DETERMINED WHAT AILS HER?

12:19.430 --> 12:20.931
Cotton:
THE PASTOR SAYS SHE'S RESTING

12:20.970 --> 12:22.938
AND BEST NOT BE DISTURBED.

12:25.140 --> 12:29.201
Mary: MAY I ASK YOU
A QUESTION, REVEREND?

12:29.240 --> 12:33.574
WHEN YOUR FATHER SEEKS OUT
DEMONS, DOES HE ASK PERMISSION?

12:33.620 --> 12:35.315
DOES HE KNOCK ON DOORS

12:35.350 --> 12:39.218
AND OFFER TO COME BACK
AT A MORE CONVENIENT TIME?

12:39.250 --> 12:42.959
OR DOES HE, ARMED
WITH THE LORD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS,

12:42.990 --> 12:45.356
DEMAND THE DEMON ANSWER TO HIM?

12:46.690 --> 12:48.954
Cotton: MY FATHER AND I
ARE DIFFERENT MEN.

12:50.330 --> 12:52.628
WE WORK IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

12:54.700 --> 12:58.568
TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF SALEM,
IT WAS NOT YOU I REQUESTED.

12:58.610 --> 13:02.307
YET IT WAS YOU
WHO ARRIVED ON OUR SHORES.

13:02.340 --> 13:05.548
DO NOT MAKE ME REGRET
SE'I'I'LING FOR MY SECOND CHOICE.

13:15.890 --> 13:17.357
Mr. Hale: CAPTAIN ALDEN.

13:17.390 --> 13:19.927
HOW FORTUITOUS.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.451
I WAS JUST ABOUT TO SET THIS
ON YOUR DOORSTEP.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.491
I'LL SPARE YOU THE MYSTERY.

13:24.530 --> 13:28.296
IT'S A RECEPTION
TOMORROW EVENING IN YOUR HONOR.

13:28.340 --> 13:29.466
John: A RECEPTION?

13:29.500 --> 13:31.036
NO.
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.

13:31.070 --> 13:33.334
Mr. Hale: BUT IT IS.
YOU'RE A SELECTMAN NOW.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.269
AND, ON A MORE PERSONAL NOTE,
A CHANCE TO MAKE AMENDS

13:36.310 --> 13:39.802
FOR MY LESS-THAN-HOSPITABLE
BEHAVIOR SINCE YOUR RETURN.

13:39.850 --> 13:42.546
CAN WE TRUST
YOU'LL BE IN ATTENDANCE?

13:42.580 --> 13:45.686

13:53.360 --> 13:55.055

13:55.100 --> 13:56.692
NOW, IS THIS ANY WAY
TO GREET THE MAN

13:56.730 --> 13:58.129
WHO SAVED YOU
FROM THOSE SAVAGES?

13:58.170 --> 13:59.899
John: WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:59.940 --> 14:01.396
William: BUSINESS, CAPTAIN.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.203
THERE IS A VESSEL IN PORT
ON WHICH I HAVE CARGO.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.128
AND UNTIL
THE QUARANTINE IS LIFI'ED,

14:05.170 --> 14:08.139
I AM MAROONED HERE
IN YOUR LITTLE WITCH TOWN.

14:08.180 --> 14:10.341
John: WE HAD A DEAL,
AND IT WAS A SIMPLE ONE --

14:10.380 --> 14:12.302
THAT I WAS NEVER
TO SET EYES ON YOU AGAIN.

14:12.350 --> 14:13.977
William: YES.
WELL, YOU NEEDN'T WORRY.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.477
WE'RE NOT THE SAME MEN WE WERE
IN THE WAR.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.340
BUT...

14:18.390 --> 14:20.756
THERE IS SOMETHING YOU COULD DO
TO HASTEN MY DEPARTURE.

14:20.790 --> 14:22.485
John: WHAT IS THAT?

14:22.520 --> 14:26.081
William: THE GIRL YOU SPOKE OF
IN BATTLE -- MARY WOLCOTT.

14:26.130 --> 14:29.998
ALTHOUGH SHE'S MARY SIBLEY NOW,
ISN'T SHE?

14:30.030 --> 14:31.429
AN INTRODUCTION WITH HER
WOULD CERTAIN--

14:31.470 --> 14:33.062
John:
YOU STAY AWAY FROM MARY.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.567
William: OR WHAT, JOHN?

14:34.600 --> 14:35.931
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

14:35.970 --> 14:38.268
John: WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE
LAST TIME.

14:38.310 --> 14:39.709
William: [ SCOFFS ]

14:39.740 --> 14:41.332
NOW, CAREFUL, CAPTAIN.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.733
BEFORE A MAN MAKES THREATS,

14:42.780 --> 14:44.702
HE SHOULD TAKE STOCK
OF WHAT HE RISKS --

14:44.750 --> 14:47.947
UNLESS YOU DO NOT MIND ME
TELLING THE GOOD PEOPLE OF SALEM

14:47.980 --> 14:50.380
JUST WHO JOHN ALDEN REALLY IS --

14:50.420 --> 14:54.584
NEITHER THE MAN NOR THE WAR HERO
HE PURPORTS TO BE.

14:57.890 --> 15:01.098
John: I WANT YOU TO FINISH YOUR
BUSINESS WITH ALL DUE HASTE,

15:01.130 --> 15:06.227
AND THEN BY COACH OR BY STEED
OR BY SHIP, I WANT YOU GONE.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.739
William: YOU HAVE MY WORD.

15:24.950 --> 15:27.282
Mary: MR. SIBLEY'S FEEDING
WILL HAVE TO WAIT

15:27.320 --> 15:29.288
UNTIL I RETURN
FROM THE RECEPTION.

William: I'M HOOKE --

16:15.970 --> 16:17.938
FORGIVE MY BOLDNESS,
BUT I WONDERED

16:17.970 --> 16:20.768
IF I MIGHT SPEAK TO YOU
OF YOUR SHIP DETAINED IN PORT.

16:20.810 --> 16:23.108
Mary: AS YOU'VE DOUBTLESS HEARD,
IT'S UNDER QUARANTINE.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.845
William:
WELL, 'TIS NO BOTHER.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.644
I MERELY MEAN TO BOARD THE
VESSEL AND RETRIEVE MY CARGO.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.568
Mary: AND RISK INFECTION?
OR WORSE?

16:31.020 --> 16:33.716
WELL, THIS MUST BE
VERY VALUABLE CARGO, MR. HOOKE.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.455

16:35.490 --> 16:37.526

16:37.560 --> 16:39.448

WELL, PERHAPS MR. SIBLEY

16:39.490 --> 16:40.923
WILL BE MORE OPEN TO REASON.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.967

MY HUSBAND AND I
ARE OF ONE MIND ON ALL MATTERS.

HASN'T SHE SUFFERED ENOUGH?

17:02.850 --> 17:04.647
Cotton: WHICH IS WHY
I SEEK TO END HER SUFFERING --

17:04.690 --> 17:07.250
BY FREEING HER
FROM THE DEMON INSIDE.

CONTACT WITH CAPTAIN ALDEN!

37:09.260 --> 37:10.284
Anne: OR WHAT?

37:10.320 --> 37:12.686
WHAT PUNISHMENT AWAITS ME?

37:12.730 --> 37:16.097
WILL YOU CRUSH THE LIFE FROM ME,
AS YOU DO YOUR ENEMIES?

37:16.130 --> 37:18.428
OR JUST MY SPIRIT,
AS YOU DO THOSE YOU LOVE?

37:18.470 --> 37:20.893
Mr. Hale: QUIET!
NOT ONE WORD MORE!

37:45.960 --> 37:48.326
John: PUT IT DOWN.

37:48.360 --> 37:50.055
William: NO.

37:50.100 --> 37:52.568
THIS PARCEL BELONGS TO ME.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.568
A CLAIM THAT EVEN MARY SIBLEY
CANNOT DISPUTE.

37:54.600 --> 37:55.931
John:
I'M NOT HERE ON HER BEHALF.

37:55.970 --> 37:58.461
NOW PUT IT DOWN.

37:58.510 --> 38:00.262
William: [ CHUCKLES ]

38:00.310 --> 38:03.609
ASK YOURSELF, CAPTAIN...

38:03.640 --> 38:04.777
IS IT REALLY WORTH IT?

38:04.810 --> 38:05.970
John: WHAT?

38:06.010 --> 38:08.001
William:
THE COST OF SE'I'I'LING OLD SCORES.

38:08.050 --> 38:10.348
WHAT WOULD BE THE CHARGE

38:10.380 --> 38:12.917
IF THE MAGISTRATE KNEW
WHAT YOU DID?

38:12.950 --> 38:14.349
MURDER?

38:17.620 --> 38:21.454
John: YOU KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.853
William: YES.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.996
I WATCHED YOU SPILL
INNOCENT BLOOD.

38:28.030 --> 38:31.090
WITHOUT REGRET OR REMORSE.

38:31.140 --> 38:34.439
MEN SLAUGHTERED LIKE ANIMALS.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.402
ALL OF THEM -- DEAD.

38:38.410 --> 38:40.207
John: NOT ALL OF THEM.

38:40.250 --> 38:42.878
WE HAD A DEAL, MR. HOOKE --

38:42.920 --> 38:46.879
THE DAY YOU FELL TO YOUR KNEES
AND BEGGED FOR YOUR LIFE

38:46.920 --> 38:48.387
THAT SHOULD I LET YOU LIVE,

38:48.420 --> 38:50.513
WE WOULD NEVER CROSS PATHS
AGAIN.

38:50.560 --> 38:52.687
YOU DIDN'T HOLD UP YOUR END.

38:52.730 --> 38:55.119
William: NOW,
THINK THIS THROUGH, CAPTAIN.

38:55.160 --> 38:56.627
John: OH, I HAVE --

38:56.660 --> 38:58.799
THOROUGHLY.

38:58.830 --> 39:03.369
AND THE ONLY LIFE I LAMENT
THAT DAY WAS THE ONE I SPARED.

39:03.400 --> 39:06.801
A MAN SHOULD KEEP HIS PROMISES,
MR. HOOKE.

39:06.840 --> 39:11.334
William: SO YOU'RE...JUST
GOING TO SLIT MY THROAT HERE,

39:11.380 --> 39:13.348
LIKE SOME YELLOW HORSE?

39:17.220 --> 39:18.346
John: NO.

39:20.050 --> 39:21.517
William: NO.

39:22.920 --> 39:23.750
[ GASPS ]

39:42.540 --> 39:44.201
[ GASPS ]

39:55.790 --> 39:58.156
John: [ PANTING ]

41:22.840 --> 41:24.307
John: MRS. SIBLEY.

41:27.710 --> 41:30.873
Mary: SLEEPLESSNESS SEEMS TO BE
EPIDEMIC THIS EVENING.

41:30.920 --> 41:32.547
John: [ CHUCKLES ]

41:35.060 --> 41:39.121
Mary: DO YOU REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME WE SPOKE,

41:39.160 --> 41:41.048
IN THE SHADOW OF THE GRAVEYARD?

41:41.090 --> 41:43.957
John: OF COURSE.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.127
Mary:
THE PROMISES WE MADE?

41:46.170 --> 41:48.320
YOU WOULD RETURN WITHIN A YEAR.

41:48.370 --> 41:51.430
John: AND YOU WOULD
BREATH LESSLY WAIT.

41:53.570 --> 41:54.935
WERE THEY LIES?

41:57.180 --> 41:58.602
Mary: NO.

42:00.210 --> 42:01.973
THEY WERE WISHES.

42:02.020 --> 42:05.842
MADE BY THOSE
THAT KNEW NOTHING OF THE WORLD.

42:07.120 --> 42:08.951
John: AND NOW?

42:10.920 --> 42:12.922
Mary: WE KNOW.

42:12.960 --> 42:18.489
WHAT WE DESIRE
AND WHAT WE MUST DO TO SURVIVE

42:18.530 --> 42:20.464
ARE OFTEN AT ODDS.

42:31.650 --> 42:33.743
IT'S, UH, LATE, CAPTAIN.

42:33.780 --> 42:35.543
John: IT IS.

42:35.580 --> 42:37.377
Mary:
LONG PAST MY BEDTIME.

42:39.790 --> 42:42.213
John: I WISH YOU
SWEET DREAMS, MARY.

42:46.930 --> 42:49.251
Mary:
PERHAPS THEY'VE ALREADY BEGUN.

43:08.580 --> 43:11.071
Mercy: [ LAUGHING ]

43:12.290 --> 43:15.054
I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.

43:15.090 --> 43:18.082
[ LAUGHING ]
