I'm emancipating from you.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.205
It's your damn daughter sinking
her fangs into my little girl.

-Watch your mouth.

to work through this.

00:09.276 --> 00:11.443
Just tell me what to do.
I will do it.

00:11.445 --> 00:13.645
I just got an offer
from a headphone company.

00:13.647 --> 00:15.047
They only want scarlett
for the commercial.

Gunnar scott,
come on out onstage with me.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.151
I don't know about you,

where this goes.

He's a red-hot country artist

00:37.671 --> 00:40.906
Who just became one of the
hottest topics in the headlines,

00:40.908 --> 00:43.642
So you knew we had to make
some room for him at the table.

00:43.644 --> 00:44.877
Please welcome luke wheeler.

00:44.879 --> 00:46.145
Hey, luke!
Hey.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.513
[ cheers and applause ]
thanks for having me.

00:47.515 --> 00:48.647
Thank you.

00:48.649 --> 00:50.682
So, you're a hot topic
right now

00:50.684 --> 00:52.751
For your very heated
and very public battle

00:52.753 --> 00:55.587
With conservative pundit
cynthia davis.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.089
How'd this all start?

00:57.091 --> 00:58.557
Well, I wanted
to get my artist

00:58.559 --> 01:00.426
Will lexington's music
on the radio...
Right.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.694
...Uh, but we ran into
some resistance

01:02.696 --> 01:04.596
Because of
his sexual orientation.

01:04.598 --> 01:08.000
So I made a public plea
to have his song requested,

01:08.002 --> 01:09.902
And cynthia took offense.

01:09.904 --> 01:12.838
And she says
that you were shaming people

01:12.840 --> 01:14.573
Into feeling like a bigot.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.842
Well, um, cynthia says
a lot of things,

01:16.844 --> 01:18.544
A lot of which aren't true,

01:18.546 --> 01:21.213
But the truth is
that will is an amazing artist,

01:21.215 --> 01:23.348
And the conversation
should be about his music.

01:23.350 --> 01:26.051
Well, but regardless
what the conversation<i> should</i> be,

01:26.053 --> 01:28.687
The fact remains that it's not
about the music, really.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.956
I mean, you've shined a light on
a very important social issue.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.791
So what's your stance
on that?

01:32.793 --> 01:35.127
Well, I believe
that any discrimination --

01:35.129 --> 01:37.963
Whether it be race, religion,
or sexual orientation --

01:37.965 --> 01:39.765
Is just plain wrong.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.800
[ cheers and applause ]

01:41.802 --> 01:43.635
I couldn't agree
more,

01:43.637 --> 01:45.437
But here's where
I'm still confused.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.906
I mean, you're the forerunner
leading this charge.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.575
Where's lexington
in all this?

01:49.577 --> 01:52.044
Well, uh, will's gone through
a little personal tragedy.

01:52.046 --> 01:53.979
He just lost his mom,
so...

01:53.981 --> 01:56.482
But he was refusing to comment
even before that, right?

01:56.484 --> 01:59.451
I think the problem
that a lot of people have is,

01:59.453 --> 02:02.921
Why does it seem like
<i> you</i> care more than him?

02:02.923 --> 02:04.790
Well, I don't know
if it does seem like that,

02:04.792 --> 02:07.226
But I can assure you
that will cares.

where this goes."

Now, I-I didn't just mean

And honestly, I'd rather spend
more time with you here

for me to think

a conversation about that

06:49.910 --> 06:51.209

07:43.297 --> 07:44.663
Yeah, I mean, uh...

07:44.665 --> 07:46.231
Well, the texture's a little bit
different than pasta,

07:46.233 --> 07:47.632
But it's delicious.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.801
Oh.
It's also lower in calories
and cholesterol

07:49.803 --> 07:51.436
Than boxed pasta

07:51.438 --> 07:53.438
And higher in potassium,
calcium, and vitamins a and c.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.474
I mean, that's the best part
about cooking your own food,

07:55.476 --> 07:57.476
Is that you can control
your nutrition.

if we coordinated.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.297
Right.
You know what?

08:19.299 --> 08:20.465
Never mind.
That's a lame idea.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.534
Hey, no.
It's -- it's a great idea.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.669
Really, I'm --
I'm happy to wear it.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.271
There's just so much
riding on tonight.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.173
I just want it
to be perfect.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.441
It<i> will</i> be.

08:29.443 --> 08:31.176
And I did get you something,
by the way...

08:31.178 --> 08:33.512
Sort of.
Really?

08:33.514 --> 08:36.348
Yeah, cadence is, uh,
spending the night at her mom's,

08:36.350 --> 08:39.718
So I'm yours...
All night.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.855
Did you know that elton john has
sold over 300 million records?

08:43.857 --> 08:46.024
And he's got six grammys,
a tony,

08:46.026 --> 08:48.159
A golden globe,
and an oscar.

08:48.161 --> 08:50.061
Has someone
been on wikipedia

08:50.063 --> 08:51.363
Since I went to get
the champagne?

08:51.365 --> 08:53.365
And the fact that he's stayed
on top for so long

08:53.367 --> 08:56.835
All by himself,
it's -- it's inspiring.

08:56.837 --> 08:59.237
Hey, what about<i> you?</i>

08:59.239 --> 09:02.040
How come you haven't...
Tried it by yourself?

09:02.042 --> 09:03.408
I don't know.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.310
Uh, I know
scarlett and I have our issues,

09:05.312 --> 09:09.180
But it's hard for me to imagine
doing it without her.

09:09.182 --> 09:12.050
Well...
Nothing lasts forever.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.718
But...

09:13.720 --> 09:15.921
That being said, you guys
are killing it right now,

09:15.923 --> 09:19.925
So there is no reason
for you not to just sit back

09:19.927 --> 09:21.760
And enjoy the moment.

09:24.197 --> 09:28.133
Kind of like how I'm enjoying
this one...With you.

09:29.403 --> 09:30.769
Yeah, me too.

09:30.771 --> 09:33.838
I think I've always been looking
for a healthier path.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.407
You know,
I think that's what

09:35.409 --> 09:37.542
The marriage with teddy
was about.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.611
I mean,
he was the anti-deacon.

09:39.613 --> 09:42.247
I think I was trying to build
a wall to protect myself,

09:42.249 --> 09:45.450
To protect my girls from...
My feelings for him.

09:45.452 --> 09:47.886
And yet it seems
you've built a door in that wall

09:47.888 --> 09:50.589
So you could let him in
or shut him out as you needed.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.424
I don't know
that I'd put it that way.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.192
Well, you had effectively
disentangled yourself

09:54.194 --> 09:55.594
From a romantic
relationship,

09:55.596 --> 09:57.862
Then you hired him
as your bandleader.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.230
Have you ever heard him
play guitar?

09:59.232 --> 10:01.132
And the songs
that we wrote together --

10:01.134 --> 10:03.568
Look, in spite of all the hell,
that part was heaven.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.236
There's just something
that happens.

10:05.238 --> 10:08.640
There's a magic
that happens.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.241
Still does.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.543
And you didn't want
to give that up.

10:11.545 --> 10:13.878
With deacon and me,
it's never about

10:13.880 --> 10:16.548
What we want
or what we don't want.

10:16.550 --> 10:19.317
I think
there's something...

10:19.319 --> 10:22.153
Really inevitable
about this relationship.

10:22.155 --> 10:25.123
It just feels like...

10:25.125 --> 10:27.659
We're inextricably tied.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.662
There's my angel!

Ahh,
not so angelic today.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.634
She's teething
and really cranky.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.769
She woke up screaming twice
last night.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.508
Well, sort of.

Noah is here,
and he wanted to cook, so...

10:45.746 --> 10:48.413
Noah...West is here?

10:48.415 --> 10:51.416
Really? Wow.
That's -- that's fast.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.118
Well, not really.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.153
We've known each other
for a while.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.022
And you think it's --
it's all right

10:57.024 --> 10:59.124
For him to be around cadence
already?

10:59.126 --> 11:01.426
Avery, he's a good guy.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.461
And cadence is too young
to understand,

11:03.463 --> 11:05.430
Which is why
I've never had a problem

Our theme is "cut out the noise,

18:04.751 --> 18:07.185
There are a couple of things
in play here.

18:08.922 --> 18:13.124
Deacon, you feel a great sense
of guilt and remorse

18:13.126 --> 18:15.593

injuries to your wife.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.562

Who, in one way or another,
have disappointed you?

18:23.236 --> 18:26.404

neglectful, controlling.

18:26.406 --> 18:29.607

sometimes volatile.

I'm not talking about choices --
just patterns.

to some degree,

18:39.619 --> 18:42.587
You have always seen rayna
as an unattainable ideal.

that the work now would be

27:40.760 --> 27:41.759
Yeah, she's fine.

27:41.761 --> 27:43.427
She was fussy,
like you said she was,

27:43.429 --> 27:46.030
And noah saved the day,
got her to calm down.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.698
Noah did?
Oh, he's so sweet.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.266
Oh, that's great.

27:49.268 --> 27:52.002
Yeah,
glad he could help out.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.504
Hope you two
are having fun.

27:53.506 --> 27:54.638
We are.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.473
In fact, I should probably
hang up and get back to it.

27:56.475 --> 27:58.042
Yeah.

27:58.044 --> 27:59.543
Yeah, I should get back
to the party.

27:59.545 --> 28:00.711
Okay. Bye.

28:00.713 --> 28:02.012
Bye.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.385
Jackie: So, you've always been
a writer?

28:08.387 --> 28:09.687
Yeah.

28:09.689 --> 28:11.689
It was poetry
before lyrics.

28:11.691 --> 28:13.123
It's just always
been my way

28:13.125 --> 28:15.192
Of sorting out my feelings,
I guess.

28:15.194 --> 28:18.295
Listening to the tracks
your label sent over,

28:18.297 --> 28:21.331
I can tell that you feel things
very deeply.

28:21.333 --> 28:24.334
Especially that duet,
"I will never let you know."

28:24.336 --> 28:26.570
It's so raw.

28:26.572 --> 28:28.172
Where'd that come from?

28:28.174 --> 28:31.542
It's about my uncle
and the love of his life.

28:31.544 --> 28:33.977
They got a real complicated
story, but it's a sweet one.

28:33.979 --> 28:36.480
But it --
it felt so personal.

28:36.482 --> 28:38.382
It must be
about more than that.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.784
Yeah. There's a lot of<i> me</i>
in there, too.

28:44.824 --> 28:47.958
There was a lot going on
in my life when I wrote it.

28:49.095 --> 28:51.195
Come on.
Let's shoot.

28:51.197 --> 28:53.230
[ cheers and applause ]

28:56.769 --> 28:58.402
Thank you so much.

29:00.606 --> 29:01.872

29:01.874 --> 29:02.873
Boston, we love you!
You nervous?

29:02.875 --> 29:04.208
I think I may vomit.

29:04.210 --> 29:05.342
[ clears throat ]
[ laughs ]

29:05.344 --> 29:06.376
Or faint. Or both.

29:06.378 --> 29:07.878
No. Listen.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.581
You are
going to be great.

29:10.583 --> 29:12.616
Now, I wanted
to bring a new friend out

29:12.618 --> 29:14.618
For this next song,
called "blue wonderful."

29:14.620 --> 29:17.721
So please give a big welcome
to gunnar scott!
Thanks.

29:17.723 --> 29:19.056
Go get 'em, rock star.

W-we know what went on.

You just say the word, and I'll
get your father out of here.

31:48.607 --> 31:50.540
I'm not going anywhere.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.342
Why don't we let colt
decide that?

31:52.344 --> 31:54.544
Stop it, please.

31:54.546 --> 31:56.013
I want dad here.

31:59.785 --> 32:01.852
I'm so sorry, colt.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.354
I'd never want
to be the one

32:04.356 --> 32:05.856
Responsible for you
being in pain.

32:05.858 --> 32:07.958
It's not your fault.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.359
Sure it is.
If it wasn't for him --

32:09.361 --> 32:11.094
No, I threw
the first punch.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.464
Why would you do that?

32:14.466 --> 32:15.599
I was defending you.

Son,
you shouldn't have --

32:19.371 --> 32:20.137
No.

32:25.377 --> 32:27.177
I'm proud of you, dad.

to the launch.

I don't think that means
that they're not excited.

You know the first time
I played here, she blew me off?

37:25.611 --> 37:27.611
And then she literally
let markus keen

37:27.613 --> 37:29.746
Just steal my spotlight
at my opry debut.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.081
And then she did nothing

37:31.083 --> 37:32.882
When autumn gave my tour spot
away to the exes.

37:32.884 --> 37:34.784
So, I mean, what does it matter
how tonight went

37:34.786 --> 37:37.053
When my label obviously
couldn't care less about me?

37:37.055 --> 37:38.221

37:38.223 --> 37:40.423
Of course
highway 65 cares about you.

Look at this.

Yeah, but I just feel
like crying.

It's just, tonight was
supposed to be perfect,

37:46.098 --> 37:48.064

It's not ruined.
Okay?

Come on.

And we're gonna turn it
all around, starting right now.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.142
What about cadence?

38:00.112 --> 38:01.645
I was being
a little overprotective.

What's going on?
What's wrong?

38:31.677 --> 38:32.876
Gunnar's right.

38:35.113 --> 38:36.513
I<i> am</i> afraid.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.017
I'm afraid of the truth.

38:41.019 --> 38:43.153
And it doesn't matter
how much I try to ignore it,

38:43.155 --> 38:44.988
Wipe it away,
stamp it out.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.189
I can't anymore.

talking about?

So, what's going on
over there?

39:36.007 --> 39:38.041
You're such a great guy.

39:40.979 --> 39:45.148
You're amazing with cadence
and just...

39:45.150 --> 39:47.817
So passionate
about stuff.

39:47.819 --> 39:50.086
Oh, there's a "but" coming,
right?

39:51.656 --> 39:55.392
But I'm not sure we're
passionate about the same stuff.

39:55.394 --> 39:57.260
You don't think we<i> could</i> be,
with time?

39:57.262 --> 39:59.028
I just don't think
we have the connection

39:59.030 --> 40:01.598
That I need to feel
right now.

40:03.402 --> 40:08.004
I guess the fantasy's
better than the reality, huh?

40:12.611 --> 40:15.345
At least we tried,
right?

40:23.021 --> 40:25.755
You don't have to leave.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.857
I know.

40:27.859 --> 40:30.026
But I-I probably should.

40:41.373 --> 40:42.772
How bad is it?

40:42.774 --> 40:44.240
Oh,
it's barely noticeable.

40:44.242 --> 40:45.275
[ both chuckle ]

40:45.277 --> 40:46.276
[ cellphone ringing ]

40:46.278 --> 40:47.877
Hold on a sec.

40:47.879 --> 40:49.279
Let me grab this.

40:49.281 --> 40:50.480
Hey, will.

40:50.482 --> 40:52.382
Hey. How's colt?

40:52.384 --> 40:54.651
Oh, he's gonna be all right.
He's a tough kid.

40:54.653 --> 40:55.919
How'd the radio spot go?

40:55.921 --> 40:57.153
It went good.

40:57.155 --> 40:58.388
Apparently,
word about it spread,

40:58.390 --> 41:00.423
Because it lit a fire
under cynthia davis again.

41:00.425 --> 41:03.493
Oh, you know what? [ sighs ]
don't you worry about her.

41:03.495 --> 41:06.496
Some people got so much hate
in them, it's just not worth it.

41:06.498 --> 41:08.398
Actually, um...

41:08.400 --> 41:10.600
I made a decision.

41:10.602 --> 41:13.369
I want to go on the show --
take her on face-to-face.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.272
Okay.

41:16.274 --> 41:18.942
I'm, uh, not sure
what changed your mind,

41:18.944 --> 41:20.677
But, uh,
if that's what you want,

41:20.679 --> 41:22.579
I'll make a call
and book us a time.

41:22.581 --> 41:24.514
No, you've done so much
for me, luke,

41:24.516 --> 41:28.251
And I am truly grateful,
but...

41:28.253 --> 41:30.053
It's time for<i> me</i>
to take from here.

41:31.089 --> 41:33.656
Well, all right, then.

41:33.658 --> 41:35.558
Go get 'er, son.

41:37.429 --> 41:39.229
