00:31.763 --> 00:33.431
- Bonsoir, Monsieur.

00:33.498 --> 00:36.901
How can Madame Xanadu
be of service?

00:36.969 --> 00:40.605
Ah, there is someone to whom
you wish to speak.

00:40.672 --> 00:43.608
Your wife, mais non?

00:43.675 --> 00:46.544
- Yes, my Inza.

00:46.612 --> 00:50.448
- Then Madame will make contact
if fate be kind.

00:50.515 --> 00:53.985
- Ah, but he so rarely is.

00:56.288 --> 00:58.022
- Ahem.

00:59.358 --> 01:01.559
- Oh, of course.

01:14.206 --> 01:17.241
- Oh, my darling.

01:17.309 --> 01:19.844
How I've missed you.

01:19.911 --> 01:24.715
I'm so lonely here and cold.

01:24.783 --> 01:28.119
- Ha ha! Th-that's the best
you could do?

01:29.454 --> 01:31.856
- Imbecile!
You have broken the spell.

01:31.923 --> 01:33.958
Your wife is forever lost.

01:34.026 --> 01:36.227
- That was supposed
to be my wife? Heh!

01:36.294 --> 01:38.763
Heck, my little spitfire
would have kicked my can

01:38.830 --> 01:40.831
For throwin' away
good money on you.

01:40.899 --> 01:42.867
- No refunds for nonbelievers.

01:42.934 --> 01:47.338
- I think we both know
you're the nonbeliever, Madame.

01:47.406 --> 01:49.340
A wind machine.

01:49.408 --> 01:51.742
Tire jacks under the table.

01:51.810 --> 01:53.010
A shame, too.

01:53.078 --> 01:55.980
You have the perfect aura
for the work,

01:56.048 --> 01:58.315
And nothing
would have pleased me more

01:58.383 --> 02:00.651
Than to be reunited
with my bride.

02:00.719 --> 02:03.554
- You will be with her
soon enough.

02:05.724 --> 02:07.558
ahh!

Young Justice - Season 1, Episode 7
"Denial"

02:41.693 --> 02:45.062
- Initiate--combat training.

02:45.130 --> 02:47.565
3, 2, 1...

02:52.637 --> 02:55.239
- Kaldor's, uh, nice,
don't you think?

02:55.307 --> 02:57.441
Handsome. Commanding.

02:57.509 --> 03:00.444
You should totally ask him out.

03:00.512 --> 03:02.880
- He's like a big brother to me.

03:02.948 --> 03:05.883
But you know who would make
the cutest couple?

03:05.951 --> 03:07.885
You and Wally.

03:10.088 --> 03:13.824
- You're so full of passion,
and he's so full of, uh--of--

03:13.892 --> 03:14.825
- It?

03:19.030 --> 03:22.166
- Fail--Aqualad.

03:22.234 --> 03:24.368
- Black Canary taught me that.

03:29.007 --> 03:31.175
- Do you have a mission for us?

03:31.243 --> 03:33.978
- Mission assignments are
the Batman's responsibility.

03:34.045 --> 03:36.413
- Yeah. Well, the Batman's
with the Robin

03:36.481 --> 03:38.649
Doing the dynamic duo thing
in gotham,

03:38.717 --> 03:40.317
But you're
headed somewhere, right?

03:40.385 --> 03:43.254
Hot date or a--a misiÃ³n?

03:43.321 --> 03:45.489
- If we can be of help...

03:47.425 --> 03:50.561
- This is Kent Nelson, a friend.

03:50.629 --> 03:52.563
He is 106 years old...

03:52.631 --> 03:54.732
- Guy doesn't look
a day over 90.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.301
- And he has been missing
for 23 days.

03:57.369 --> 04:00.237
Kent was a charter member
of the justice society,

04:00.305 --> 04:02.907
The precursor
to your mentors' justice league.

04:02.974 --> 04:06.477
- Of course. Nelson was
earth's sorcerer supreme.

04:06.545 --> 04:08.012
He was Doctor Fate.

04:08.079 --> 04:09.346
- more like
doctor fake.

04:09.414 --> 04:11.682
Guy knows a little advanced
science and "dumbledores" it up

04:11.750 --> 04:13.784
To scare the bad guys
and impress the babes.

04:13.852 --> 04:17.421
- Kent may simply be
on one of his walkabouts,

04:17.488 --> 04:19.990
But he is caretaker
to the helmet of fate,

04:20.058 --> 04:22.293
The source of the doctor's
mystic might,

04:22.360 --> 04:25.062
And it is unwise
to leave such power unguarded.

04:25.130 --> 04:28.299
- He's like the great sorcerer
priests and priestesses of Mars.

04:28.366 --> 04:30.835
I would be honored
to help find him.

04:30.902 --> 04:31.836
- Me, too.

04:31.903 --> 04:34.338
So honored
I can barely stand it.

04:34.406 --> 04:36.440
Magic rocks.

04:36.508 --> 04:38.142
- Take this.

04:38.210 --> 04:40.511
It is the key
to the tower of fate.

04:40.579 --> 04:46.550
- What are the chances we both
so admire the mystic arts?

04:48.253 --> 04:49.520
- So, Wally,

04:49.588 --> 04:54.291
When did you first realize your
honest affinity for sorcery?

04:54.359 --> 04:56.961
- Well, I--I don't like
to brag, but, uh,

04:57.028 --> 04:58.629
Before I became Kid Flash,

04:58.697 --> 05:01.298
I seriously considered
becoming a wizard myself.

05:02.534 --> 05:04.902
- We've reached
Tornado's coordinates, but--

05:04.970 --> 05:06.670
- Nothing's there.

05:06.738 --> 05:08.072
- Take us down.

05:15.380 --> 05:17.781
- Grant us access to the tower,

05:17.849 --> 05:21.018
And I promise an end
to your suffering.

05:21.086 --> 05:22.486
Continue to refuse, and--

05:22.554 --> 05:23.487
aah!

05:27.959 --> 05:28.826
- Shush, teekl!

05:28.894 --> 05:31.795
I'm watching the show.

05:34.032 --> 05:37.034
- Enjoy it...While you can.

05:37.102 --> 05:43.102
Soon enough, my friends
will come to help me.

05:43.608 --> 05:44.608
Aah!

05:45.810 --> 05:47.278
- Encore! Encore! Ha ha!

05:48.380 --> 05:49.313
- What?

05:52.717 --> 05:55.986
- Oh.

05:58.290 --> 05:59.223
- Nothing.

05:59.291 --> 06:01.292
This isn't simple camouflage.

06:01.359 --> 06:02.660
- So what do you think,

06:02.727 --> 06:06.030
Adaptive micro-opto-electronics
combined with phase shifting?

06:06.097 --> 06:08.666
- Absolutely...

06:08.733 --> 06:09.700
Not.

06:09.768 --> 06:13.337
Clearly mystic powers
are at work here.

06:18.209 --> 06:20.778
- Hey, Abra Kadabra,
aren't you using

06:20.845 --> 06:23.847
Adaptive micro-opto-electronics
and phase shifting?

06:23.915 --> 06:26.350
- Yes.

06:29.487 --> 06:32.022
- A test of faith.

06:32.090 --> 06:33.891
Stand behind me.

06:55.480 --> 06:58.000
- Uh, where'd the door go?

06:59.384 --> 07:01.685
- Greetings.
You have entered with a key,

07:01.753 --> 07:04.021
But the tower
does not recognize you.

07:04.089 --> 07:07.524
Please state
your purpose and intent.

07:08.927 --> 07:10.928
- We are true believers,

07:10.996 --> 07:13.864
Here to find Doctor Fate.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.668
- Yaah!

07:48.537 --> 07:52.407
Those were my favorite boots.

07:52.475 --> 07:55.010
This Nelson guy
better be worth it.

08:05.054 --> 08:08.189
- The tower may not
appreciate trespassers.

08:08.257 --> 08:09.190
- Mute.

08:09.258 --> 08:11.092
- Ack!

08:17.633 --> 08:19.067
- Hello, Kent.

08:19.135 --> 08:22.070
How unlike you to bring
guests to the tower,

08:22.138 --> 08:26.041
Especially one with
such potent mystic power.

08:26.108 --> 08:30.211
- My friends come to help me.

08:38.486 --> 08:39.788
- Having trouble...

08:39.855 --> 08:41.289
Maintaining altitude.

08:41.357 --> 08:42.756
I'm so hot.

08:42.825 --> 08:44.092
- You certainly are.

08:44.159 --> 08:45.093
- Wally!

08:45.161 --> 08:46.728
- Hey, inches
above sizzling death,

08:46.796 --> 08:48.630
I'm entitled to speak my mind.

08:48.698 --> 08:51.733
- my physiology
and m'gann's

08:51.801 --> 08:53.635
Are susceptible
to extreme heat.

08:53.703 --> 08:55.670
We must climb out quickly.

08:57.540 --> 08:59.107
- Hello, Megan.

08:59.175 --> 09:02.243
We never truly answered
the question.

09:02.311 --> 09:04.346
Red Tornado sent us

09:04.413 --> 09:08.850
To see if mr. Nelson
and the helmet were safe!

09:12.655 --> 09:13.822
- Yahh!

09:15.458 --> 09:17.559
- This platform,
it should be red-hot,

09:17.626 --> 09:19.828
But it is cool to the touch.

09:19.895 --> 09:22.097
- Don't worry, megalicious.
I got you.

09:22.164 --> 09:23.164
- Enough!

09:23.232 --> 09:25.834
Your little "impress Megan
at all costs" game

09:25.901 --> 09:27.502
Nearly got us all barbecued.

09:27.570 --> 09:29.504
- When did this become my fault?

09:29.572 --> 09:32.474
- When you lied
to that whatever it was

09:32.541 --> 09:34.776
And called yourself
a true believer.

09:34.844 --> 09:37.445
- Wally, you don't believe?

09:38.314 --> 09:39.681
- Fine! Fine!

09:39.749 --> 09:42.150
I lied about believing in magic.

09:42.218 --> 09:44.986
But magic is the real lie,
a major load.

09:45.054 --> 09:48.990
- Wally, I studied for a year at the
conservatory of sorcery in Atlantis.

09:49.058 --> 09:52.660
The mystic arts created the skin
icons that power my water bearers.

09:52.728 --> 09:54.662
- Dude, you ever hear
of bioelectricity?

09:54.730 --> 09:55.930
Hey, in primitive cultures,

09:55.998 --> 09:57.699
Fire was once considered
magical, too.

09:57.767 --> 10:00.301
Today it's all
just a bunch of tricks.

10:00.369 --> 10:01.736
- You're pretty close-minded

10:01.804 --> 10:05.673
For a guy who can break the
sound barrier in his sneakers.

10:05.741 --> 10:07.008
- That's science.

10:07.076 --> 10:10.612
I recreated Flash's laboratory
experiment, and here I am.

10:10.679 --> 10:13.948
Everything can be
explained by science.

10:14.016 --> 10:16.184
- Let us test that theory.

10:16.252 --> 10:19.287
- Wait! The back-draft from
the lava will roast us alive!

10:21.257 --> 10:23.191
- It's snow.

10:23.259 --> 10:26.494
- Do you ever get tired
of being wrong?

10:32.101 --> 10:33.334
Well?

10:33.402 --> 10:34.636
- Ever hear of string theory?

10:34.703 --> 10:36.137
We're in a pocket dimension.

10:36.205 --> 10:37.405
- Ahh!

10:37.473 --> 10:39.040
- What's that?

10:41.811 --> 10:45.613
- Ooh. Maybe it's Nelson's
magic wand.

10:46.816 --> 10:48.016
- I got it.
- I got it.

10:48.083 --> 10:50.618
- Ahh. I can't let go.
- Ahh. I can't let go.

10:56.425 --> 10:57.992
- Are we there yet?

10:58.060 --> 10:59.360
Are we there yet?

10:59.428 --> 11:01.396
Are we there yet?

11:01.464 --> 11:03.865
- Tell us how
to find the helmet.

11:06.268 --> 11:09.237
- Can't. Having too much fun.

11:11.340 --> 11:12.373
Unh!

11:12.441 --> 11:14.609
- Still having fun?

11:14.677 --> 11:15.810
- Heh heh. I am.

11:15.878 --> 11:16.878
Zap him again

11:16.946 --> 11:20.448
Or dump him off the side
and watch him splat.

11:21.317 --> 11:22.250
- Aah!

11:23.319 --> 11:25.153
- Ah, yes, yes.

11:25.221 --> 11:27.889
I suppose
we might still need him.

11:31.460 --> 11:34.395
- I don't understand Wally.
It's almost like

11:34.463 --> 11:37.465
He needs to believe
the impossible can't happen.

11:37.533 --> 11:39.968
- Wally uses his understanding
of science

11:40.035 --> 11:41.970
To control
what he cannot comprehend.

11:42.037 --> 11:43.571
Acknowledging the existence
of magic

11:43.639 --> 11:47.075
Would be to relinquishhe last
vestige of that control.

11:57.786 --> 11:59.387
- Abra Kadabra.

11:59.455 --> 12:01.222
- Well, would you look at that.

12:06.629 --> 12:07.962
- Uhh.
- Uhh.

12:08.030 --> 12:09.731
- In here.

12:10.699 --> 12:12.867
- No! No! No!

12:12.935 --> 12:14.636
I want that helmet!

12:14.703 --> 12:16.604
I want it! I want it! I want it!

12:23.112 --> 12:25.713
- I'm Kent Nelson, by the way.

12:25.781 --> 12:26.948
- No duh. Ow!

12:27.016 --> 12:30.184
- I'm Artemis.
Miss manners here is Wally.

12:30.252 --> 12:32.954
- Well, Artemis,
we're up against an opponent

12:33.022 --> 12:35.456
With tremendous mystic power.

12:35.524 --> 12:37.125
Abra Kadabra?

12:37.192 --> 12:40.061
Flash proved he uses futuristic
technology to simulate magic.

12:40.129 --> 12:42.130
Guy's all show and no biz.

12:42.197 --> 12:43.231
- Right you are.

12:43.299 --> 12:44.332
- He is?

12:44.400 --> 12:45.667
- Abra is a charlatan.

12:45.734 --> 12:48.937
But Klarion, the witch boy,
the Kid with the cat,

12:49.004 --> 12:51.339
He's an actual lord of chaos,

12:51.407 --> 12:55.810
The ultimate enemy of a lord
of order like Doctor Fate.

12:55.878 --> 12:59.247
- Right. You're a lord of order.

12:59.315 --> 13:00.481
- Oh, no, not me.

13:00.549 --> 13:03.785
I'm just an old coot
fate used to put on

13:03.852 --> 13:07.622
Until my wife Inza convinced me
there could be more to life.

13:07.690 --> 13:11.326
Ah, she was a real pistol,
that Inza.

13:11.393 --> 13:13.461
Anyhoo, Klarion's
after the helmet.

13:13.529 --> 13:16.397
If he gets his
sticky little mitts on it,

13:16.465 --> 13:20.535
He'll turn the planet into his own
personal playground of pandemonium.

13:29.578 --> 13:31.379
- Unh!
- Ohh!

13:33.916 --> 13:35.583
- Friends of yours?

13:38.354 --> 13:39.520
- Friends of yours?

13:54.770 --> 13:55.703
- Aah!

13:55.771 --> 13:57.305
- Mr. Nelson!

14:05.114 --> 14:07.048
- No!

14:07.116 --> 14:11.586
- Not bad for a former
"doctor fake," eh, Kid?

14:12.621 --> 14:14.789
The bubble'll give you
just enough time

14:14.857 --> 14:17.125
To do what you need to do.

14:17.192 --> 14:18.826
- I have no idea
what I need to do.

14:18.894 --> 14:24.265
- Have faith
in what you can't explain.

14:24.333 --> 14:28.970
Believe in what
you can no longer deny.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.255
- 28, 29, 30.

14:41.322 --> 14:43.323
Come on. Come on.

14:44.659 --> 14:48.762
- I want that helmet,
and I want it now!

14:53.935 --> 14:55.168
Wally, we're in trouble.

14:55.236 --> 14:57.304
Tell Kent we need Doctor Fate.

14:58.172 --> 14:59.106
- Waah!

15:01.609 --> 15:03.577
Aah!

15:20.995 --> 15:23.697
A test of faith.

15:25.233 --> 15:26.767
- Hey, dumb Kid,

15:26.834 --> 15:29.169
You put that on,
you may never get it off.

15:37.545 --> 15:40.013
ok, ok. No problem.

15:40.081 --> 15:42.149
I'm not here.
I'm just delusional.

15:42.216 --> 15:43.650
- Still don't believe?

15:43.718 --> 15:47.454
Seriously, Kid, how'd you get
so bullheaded in 15 short years?

15:47.522 --> 15:49.323
- But--but you're--you're--

15:49.390 --> 15:50.991
- Yep, but don't feel bad.

15:51.059 --> 15:53.226
Soon as this little brouhaha
is over,

15:53.294 --> 15:54.494
My spirit will ascend,

15:54.562 --> 15:57.564
And I'll be reunited
with my beloved Inza.

15:57.632 --> 15:59.566
- O-oh. Ok.

15:59.634 --> 16:01.568
Wait. Does that mean that I'm--

16:01.636 --> 16:05.572
- Ah, you're alive, but your
soul no longer controls your body.

16:05.640 --> 16:08.342
See, we're inside the helmet.

16:08.409 --> 16:09.710
You put it on,

16:09.777 --> 16:12.412
And my soul got sucked in,

16:12.480 --> 16:15.749
Probably because I spent so
many years serving its master.

16:15.817 --> 16:17.651
- Master?
- Nabu,

16:17.719 --> 16:18.952
The real Doctor Fate,

16:19.020 --> 16:22.189
One of them lords of order
I told you about.

16:22.256 --> 16:24.524
He's the guy controlling
your body now.

16:24.592 --> 16:25.759
Wanna watch?

16:28.930 --> 16:30.197
- Give it up, Nabu!

16:30.264 --> 16:32.866
Order went out of style
in the 20th century.

16:32.934 --> 16:35.235
this battle is pointless.

16:35.303 --> 16:38.505
You sought to take the helmet
before it claimed a host,

16:38.573 --> 16:40.273
But you are too late.

16:40.341 --> 16:41.875
- Shut it, you old fart!

16:51.119 --> 16:53.053
- Agh!

16:58.860 --> 17:00.227
- Aah!

17:00.294 --> 17:01.661
What gives?

17:01.729 --> 17:03.663
- Well, it is your body.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.031
- Then let me control it.

17:05.098 --> 17:06.767
With fate's power and my speed--

17:06.834 --> 17:08.602
- Sorry, Kid.
Doesn't work that way.

17:08.669 --> 17:12.839
But you can see why I haven't
put on the helmet in 65 years.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.509
- And if fate loses this fight?

17:15.576 --> 17:18.612
- You see Inza before I do.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.253
- Aah!

17:44.705 --> 17:46.873
- You're out of practice, Nabu,

17:46.941 --> 17:49.109
And that pathetic host body,

17:49.177 --> 17:51.912
Zero affinity
for the mystic arts.

17:54.982 --> 17:57.117
- Aah!

17:58.719 --> 18:01.021
- Ooh, rainbow power.

18:02.090 --> 18:04.691
- I am paying attention,
you stupid cat.

18:04.759 --> 18:06.793
in case you hadn't noticed,

18:06.861 --> 18:08.628
I'm winning.

18:12.200 --> 18:16.336
- It is difficult
for a lord of order or chaos

18:16.404 --> 18:19.306
To maintain a presence
on the physical plane.

18:24.011 --> 18:29.249
I am bound to the helmet
and use a human host.

18:30.618 --> 18:33.053
But that is not your way.

18:33.121 --> 18:35.322
- You're babbling, Nabu.

18:35.389 --> 18:36.923
- Am I?

18:43.664 --> 18:45.365
- Teekl!

18:45.433 --> 18:49.970
I can't believe you would
assault a defenseless pussycat.

18:50.037 --> 18:54.241
- We both know that creature
is no cat, witch boy,

18:54.308 --> 18:56.476
And without your familiar,

18:56.544 --> 19:00.113
You have no anchor
in this reality.

19:00.181 --> 19:01.515
- Bully!

19:01.582 --> 19:02.849
Killjoy!

19:02.917 --> 19:04.317
Geezer!

19:05.386 --> 19:07.787
Holy carp.

19:09.123 --> 19:10.857
We're outta here!

19:22.170 --> 19:24.571
Wha?

19:24.639 --> 19:26.706
- Show's over.

19:30.244 --> 19:33.813
- Yes! That's how we kick it
on the earthly plane.

19:37.218 --> 19:39.786
- Uh, it's--it's over, right?

19:39.854 --> 19:42.722
So why isn't Nabu
taking off the helmet?

19:42.790 --> 19:45.292
- Because the earth
needs Doctor Fate.

19:45.359 --> 19:48.061
I will not release this body.

19:48.129 --> 19:49.462
- He can't do that!

19:49.530 --> 19:50.730
Can he do that?

19:50.798 --> 19:51.965
- Can, but shouldn't.

19:52.033 --> 19:54.234
Nabu, this is not
the right candidate.

19:54.302 --> 19:57.270
The Kid's soul belongs
to the world of science,

19:57.338 --> 19:58.271
Not sorcery.

19:58.339 --> 20:00.540
- True, but I do not appreciate

20:00.608 --> 20:03.376
Being permanently
hidden away, useless,

20:03.444 --> 20:07.113
And isolated
for decades at a time.

20:07.181 --> 20:09.349
Chaos must not be allowed
to reign.

20:09.417 --> 20:10.717
- That won't happen again.

20:10.785 --> 20:12.385
The boy'll take the helmet

20:12.453 --> 20:15.121
And make sure
you're put to good use.

20:15.189 --> 20:16.356
- Yeah. I swear.

20:16.424 --> 20:17.657
- And in the meantime,

20:17.725 --> 20:20.727
I'll stick around,
keep you company.

20:20.795 --> 20:23.697
- Wait. What happened
to you ascending, seeing Inza?

20:23.764 --> 20:25.332
- So you believe now, eh?

20:25.399 --> 20:27.067
Don't sweat it, Kid.

20:27.134 --> 20:31.271
I'll spend a few millennia here,
then see Inza.

20:31.339 --> 20:33.306
That's the great thing
about eternity.

20:33.374 --> 20:35.542
It's eternal.

20:35.610 --> 20:37.811
- The bargain is acceptable.

20:37.878 --> 20:40.480
- Some free advice
before you go.

20:40.548 --> 20:42.148
Find your own little spitfire,

20:42.216 --> 20:45.318
One who won't let you
get away with nothin',

20:45.386 --> 20:46.553
For example, that--

21:16.751 --> 21:20.453
You never said what happened to
you when you put on the helmet.

21:20.521 --> 21:22.722
- Energy from the thing
rewrote my brain's beta waves.

21:22.790 --> 21:25.392
I was bioscripted into becoming
Doctor Fate for a few minutes.

21:25.459 --> 21:26.326
No big.

21:26.394 --> 21:27.560
- Wait. You're still claiming

21:27.628 --> 21:29.329
There's no such thing as magic?

21:29.397 --> 21:33.066
if that's how you feel,
why keep it at all?

21:33.934 --> 21:34.868
- Souvenir.

21:34.935 --> 21:36.503
- Geek!

21:39.874 --> 21:41.908
Find your own
little spitfire,

21:41.976 --> 21:45.912
One who won't let you
get away with nothin'.

21:49.050 --> 21:50.850
- Hello, Megan.

21:50.918 --> 21:53.720
Guess who bought us 2 tickets
to a magic show.
