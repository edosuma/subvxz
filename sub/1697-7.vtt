00:03.180 --> 00:05.810
Wow. Would you look at that?

00:05.860 --> 00:08.420
l know. Lilly's the queen of backwash.

00:08.460 --> 00:11.970
l bet he's sucking up
bits of her burger right now.

00:14.060 --> 00:15.930
This is a big moment for Lilly,

00:15.980 --> 00:19.170
and if you had a romantic bone
in your body, you'd be able to see that.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.780
Hey, l have eyes. Okay, look.

00:21.820 --> 00:25.330
He just said something funny.
She laughed. Big whoop.

00:25.860 --> 00:29.560
She's not laughing 'cause he's funny.
She's laughing 'cause he's cute.

00:29.620 --> 00:30.650
Boy brains.

00:30.700 --> 00:34.370
You might as well scoop them out
and store nuts up there.

00:35.340 --> 00:37.690
So girls laugh at me 'cause l'm cute.

00:37.740 --> 00:40.090
No, girls laugh at you
'cause you nod like a chicken

00:40.140 --> 00:41.650
and you fall over things.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.010
l do not.

00:43.060 --> 00:45.170
Hey, what up, baby?

00:49.580 --> 00:52.810
Oh, my gosh. l don't believe it.

00:52.860 --> 00:55.420
-What?
-He just asked her to be his girlfriend.

00:55.460 --> 00:58.020
-How can you tell?
-Wait for it.

01:03.420 --> 01:05.800
He just asked me to be his girlfriend!

01:15.740 --> 01:18.450
They have no idea how cute they are.

01:20.060 --> 01:22.650
-You are so cute.
-You're cuter.

01:22.700 --> 01:24.810
-No, you're cuter.
-No, you're cuter.

01:24.860 --> 01:27.970
Yeah, you're both adorable.
Can you pass the salt?

01:28.020 --> 01:32.050
l made you a mix CD to celebrate
the nine days we've spent together.

01:32.100 --> 01:35.290
lt's right there next to the pepper.

01:35.340 --> 01:37.570
The soundtrack of our love.

01:39.260 --> 01:42.930
Help me out here, people.
l'm chewing on cardboard here.

01:42.980 --> 01:45.440
You make me so happy, Lilly-pad.

01:45.500 --> 01:48.890
Not as happy as you make me,
Lukie-Wookie.

01:50.220 --> 01:52.600

02:50.220 --> 02:52.330
No, you. No, you.

02:53.660 --> 02:55.370
l'm getting another call.

02:55.420 --> 02:57.690
-Hello?
-Hang up already!

02:58.540 --> 02:59.810
Okay.

03:00.700 --> 03:02.130
l gotta go.

03:02.180 --> 03:04.640
No, you. No, you.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.920
No, me.

03:07.980 --> 03:10.490
Hey. That was rude.

03:10.540 --> 03:12.210
You want to talk rude?

03:12.260 --> 03:15.410
This is the first time we've walked
home together in nine days,

03:15.460 --> 03:19.450
and you spent the whole time going,
''You see that cloud, too?

03:19.500 --> 03:22.610
''Let's make that our cloud.
l love our cloud.

03:22.660 --> 03:26.570
''l just ran into a tree.
You ran into a tree, too?''

03:28.540 --> 03:31.130
Well, l can't help it.
l just like him so much.

03:31.180 --> 03:34.570
l know, and l'm happy for you. l am.

03:34.620 --> 03:36.090
But l never see you any more.

03:36.140 --> 03:38.410
Well, you could've sat with us
at lunch today.

03:38.500 --> 03:39.850
l did.

03:40.660 --> 03:42.530
Really? Are you sure?

03:43.380 --> 03:45.450
My point exactly.

03:45.980 --> 03:48.610
l'm sorry.
Hey, how about l come over Saturday,

03:48.660 --> 03:50.930
and we do a movie night,
just like we used to?

03:50.980 --> 03:53.280
You're just doing that
'cause you feel sorry for me.

03:53.340 --> 03:54.930
Well...

03:55.740 --> 03:57.530
But l'll take it.

04:00.860 --> 04:02.330
Go ahead.

04:02.820 --> 04:03.960
Hi.

04:04.940 --> 04:06.410
Really?

04:09.180 --> 04:12.050
You're right. Our cloud is floating away.

04:12.100 --> 04:13.490
Bye, cloud.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.089
l'll miss you.

04:20.940 --> 04:25.090
Why? Why? Why? What did l do?

04:25.220 --> 04:27.090
Rico, what happened?

04:28.060 --> 04:30.130
We were robbed.

04:30.180 --> 04:32.290
You're kidding. How bad were we hit?

04:32.340 --> 04:36.290
Look! Third one down,
just below the red ones. They're gone!

04:36.820 --> 04:38.850
A pair of sunglasses?

04:39.780 --> 04:43.210
This is tragic, and they were so young.

04:43.740 --> 04:45.810
Jackson, this is serious.

04:45.860 --> 04:49.640
No, dude, you're right.
l'll call Malibu PD,

04:49.700 --> 04:51.450
eyewear division.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.450
You don't get it, do you?
lt's not just the sunglasses.

04:54.500 --> 04:58.530
They've stolen Rico's honour,
and this will not stand!

05:04.540 --> 05:07.170
Rico, what are you doing here
so early?

05:07.220 --> 05:10.490
Just making sure
my new security system works.

05:11.100 --> 05:13.250
What security system?

05:15.580 --> 05:16.850
Rico!

05:18.220 --> 05:20.520
That new security system.

05:22.540 --> 05:23.680
Let this be a warning

05:23.740 --> 05:28.130
to all who dare challenge
the power of the mighty Rico!

05:34.020 --> 05:36.290
So, y'all excited about movie night?

05:36.340 --> 05:38.530
Yeah, and just to let you know, Dad,

05:38.580 --> 05:42.450
you are more than welcome
to skoodle your boodle out of here.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.330
Well, you don't have to worry
about that, darling,

05:46.380 --> 05:49.170
'cause l'm gonna be out
in the garage rearranging some tools

05:49.220 --> 05:51.780
and listening to my police scanner.

05:52.420 --> 05:54.980
That's the way
a man spends Saturday night.

05:56.260 --> 05:59.250
You really miss race car season,
don't you, Daddy?

05:59.300 --> 06:03.770
Yeah. This time of year, all they got
on Tv is those stupid dance shows.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.330
-Hi, hi.
-Hey.

06:11.140 --> 06:13.650
What's going on?
You're not in your movie jammies.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.370
Right. About that...

06:15.420 --> 06:18.370
l mean that's a cute outfit, but it looks
like you're about to go out with...

06:18.420 --> 06:20.210
Lucas.

06:21.380 --> 06:24.730
Hey, Miley, thanks for the invite.
l brought caramel corn.

06:24.780 --> 06:28.050
Great,
'cause l only had enough for two.

06:28.820 --> 06:31.050
Can l talk to you in the kitchen?

06:31.100 --> 06:34.720
Just you and me? Alone?
Are you sure?

06:35.900 --> 06:37.930
Miley, you're so funny.

06:38.300 --> 06:40.890
Look, l'm sorry,
but he called at the last minute,

06:40.940 --> 06:44.450
and l told him l couldn't talk to him,
but then he said, ''You are talking,''

06:44.500 --> 06:47.410
and then l laughed, and then
he laughed, and then l laughed...

06:47.460 --> 06:50.690
And to think that l missed out
on this yuk-fest,

06:50.740 --> 06:52.730
emphasis on the yuck.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.170
You could've called to warn me.

06:54.220 --> 06:57.010
-Well, l was afraid you'd yell.
-l am yelling.

06:57.060 --> 06:59.930
Yes, but you're doing it quietly.

06:59.980 --> 07:02.280
l cannot believe
you would be this selfish.

07:02.340 --> 07:04.800
You are the worst best friend ever.

07:06.940 --> 07:08.530
Who's that?

07:08.580 --> 07:11.090
Special delivery
from your worst best friend ever.

07:11.140 --> 07:12.450
Come on in, Derek.

07:12.500 --> 07:15.490
You set me up on a blind date?

07:15.540 --> 07:17.250
That is the most

07:17.300 --> 07:20.330
wonderful thing
you have ever done for me.

07:21.140 --> 07:22.930
Well, hello, there.

07:23.660 --> 07:26.250
Hi. l'm Lucas's cousin, Derek.

07:26.460 --> 07:29.930
Yes, you are, and l'm Miley.

07:32.380 --> 07:34.970
And l'm in my movie jammies.

07:43.540 --> 07:45.690
You sure this movie isn't too scary
for you guys?

07:45.740 --> 07:48.120
Not when l have you to protect me.

07:52.660 --> 07:56.610
lt's just a movie. lt's just a movie.
lt's just a movie.

07:57.100 --> 08:00.880
One of the worst dates of my life.

08:01.900 --> 08:03.330
Sorry.

08:03.380 --> 08:06.530
Something's in there.
Something's in there.

08:06.580 --> 08:07.720
There's something's in...

08:07.780 --> 08:09.530
l knew it! l knew it!

08:11.220 --> 08:13.370
l didn't know we were having a party.

08:16.180 --> 08:19.720
Correction. The worst date of my life.

08:23.900 --> 08:27.010
-Hey, Jackson. Can l get a hot dog?
-l don't know. How long do you have?

08:27.060 --> 08:29.010
What do you mean?

08:29.860 --> 08:33.450

fruit-frozen, fruit-smoothie,

08:55.820 --> 08:59.810

hamburgers, hoagies and hot dogs.

09:05.260 --> 09:07.610

You know what?

09:25.660 --> 09:28.040
Here. There's your hot dog.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.930
Now, rope me, baby.

09:29.980 --> 09:31.970
<i>Activate trap door</i>.

09:32.020 --> 09:33.240
What?

09:35.780 --> 09:38.450
Jackson, are you okay?

09:39.180 --> 09:41.740
Get Rico!

09:42.860 --> 09:44.530
And a doctor!

09:48.940 --> 09:52.560
So Derek Hanson actually jumped
into your lap?

09:52.620 --> 09:54.650
Like a little girl.

09:54.700 --> 09:57.450
''lt's in the house! lt's in the house!''

09:57.500 --> 10:01.410
Yeah, l was picking caramel corn
out of my hair for about two days.

10:02.580 --> 10:03.890
How could Lilly do this to me?

10:03.940 --> 10:06.530
You know, she was just trying to
hook you up so you didn't feel left out.

10:06.580 --> 10:09.290
Sure, it wasn't
the one-on-one time you wanted,

10:09.340 --> 10:12.090
but it was still a very caring gesture.

10:13.420 --> 10:14.810
Wow, Oliver.

10:14.860 --> 10:16.730
-That was insightful...
-Yeah.

10:16.780 --> 10:19.130
-...smart and sensitive.
-Yeah.

10:19.180 --> 10:21.090
What happened to your boy brain?

10:21.140 --> 10:24.570
l spent last night checking out
my mom's chick magazines.

10:24.620 --> 10:26.570
l learned that l'm an autumn,

10:26.620 --> 10:29.180
capri pants are the best
for my body shape,

10:29.220 --> 10:31.930
and new love, it's a bright flame

10:31.980 --> 10:35.330
that eventually dims
into a warm, comfortable glow.

10:36.100 --> 10:39.690
Well, Lucas is her first real boyfriend.

10:39.740 --> 10:44.250
And she does seem to have achieved
a new level of emotional satisfaction.

10:45.300 --> 10:48.210
Okay, now you're seriously
weirding me out.

10:48.820 --> 10:50.970
Just talk to her at lunch.

10:51.300 --> 10:55.080
And the velvet belt, so last season.

11:10.060 --> 11:11.850
She hasn't said a word to me all day.

11:11.900 --> 11:13.650
She wouldn't even look at me
in English,

11:13.700 --> 11:16.850
and when she looked at me in Biology,
daggers.

11:17.580 --> 11:20.290
You've got a boyfriend
who's crazy about you.

11:20.340 --> 11:22.010
lt's gotta be tough for her.

11:22.060 --> 11:24.440
You're so great.
l can't believe you're all mine.

11:24.500 --> 11:27.530
Well, believe it.
You're the only one for me.

11:28.340 --> 11:30.900
Well, aren't you a busy boy.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.290
Lilly, l really need to talk to you.

11:33.340 --> 11:35.170
-Come on.
-One second.

11:35.220 --> 11:37.490
Miley, l'm really sorry about
the other night, and l called you...

11:37.540 --> 11:42.010
Don't worry about it. l forgive you,
but l have to tell you something.

11:42.060 --> 11:43.450
Lucas...

11:45.620 --> 11:48.050
Lucas is cheating on you.

11:50.540 --> 11:53.490
-What?
-Lucas is cheating on you.

11:53.540 --> 11:56.850
-What?
-Lucas is cheating on you.

12:02.420 --> 12:04.130
What? And... And...

12:04.180 --> 12:07.050
And... And... You...

12:08.860 --> 12:10.210
lt's true.

12:10.260 --> 12:13.410
Yeah, tell her,
Lu-kiss-every-girl-in-school.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.050
Lilly, l feel horrible about this.

12:17.100 --> 12:19.370
A little late in the day for that, bub.

12:19.420 --> 12:22.570
l'm so sorry that your best friend
is so threatened by our relationship,

12:22.620 --> 12:24.450
she'd lie to break us up.

12:24.500 --> 12:27.930
That's right. Straight from the...
Cheater say what?

12:28.860 --> 12:30.610
So it's not true?

12:32.020 --> 12:34.210
Of course not.

12:34.260 --> 12:36.170
Come on, Lilly.
Who are you going to believe?

12:36.220 --> 12:39.130
That lip-lock liar or your best friend?

12:41.340 --> 12:43.050
Come on, Lucas.

12:51.580 --> 12:54.370
Now this is why y'all don't get dates.

12:59.940 --> 13:01.490
Hello, there.

13:02.700 --> 13:05.450
Miley, what are you doing here?

13:05.660 --> 13:07.450
l just came to tell you, you were right.

13:07.500 --> 13:11.170
-Really?
-l was jealous. But not of you.

13:11.220 --> 13:14.010
Of her with you. l want to be with you.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.650
l want to find
puffy little clouds with you.

13:16.700 --> 13:18.410
Miley, l... Miley...

13:18.460 --> 13:22.730
No, no, no. Don't speak. Just kiss me.
No, l'll kiss you.

13:22.780 --> 13:25.370
Hey, whoa. Nice try,

13:26.020 --> 13:29.720
but l think you and l both know
the kind of guy l really am.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.050
What was l thinking?

13:38.100 --> 13:41.290
He is never going
to hit on Lilly's best friend.

13:45.460 --> 13:48.570
You couldn't have thought of that
five minutes ago?

13:49.100 --> 13:51.930
l'm sorry.
l mean, l had to try something.

13:51.980 --> 13:55.810
l mean, it's not like
l can just put on some disguise and...

13:55.860 --> 13:58.420
Boy, am l stupid.

14:02.220 --> 14:04.210
Does anybody work here?

14:07.740 --> 14:10.040
Wow. When you apologise,
you don't fool around.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.650
This is the coolest restaurant in town.

14:11.700 --> 14:15.650
Well, it's the least l could do
after the way l acted.

14:15.700 --> 14:18.130
What's the deal? l've been waiting
an hour for a table here.

14:18.180 --> 14:21.090
Well, when l have a table, l'll tell you.

14:22.780 --> 14:24.130
Really?

14:26.060 --> 14:29.810
You know what? l completely forgot,
it's my little girl's birthday.

14:29.860 --> 14:31.490
Can you help us out? Come on.

14:31.540 --> 14:33.130
No, it isn't.

14:35.540 --> 14:39.810
You know what? l got the wrong girl.
lt's her birthday.

14:39.860 --> 14:41.530
How did l screw that up?

14:41.580 --> 14:43.770
Mine was two months ago.

14:44.980 --> 14:46.810
Do you want to eat?

14:47.980 --> 14:52.730
l'm sorry, but this is what happens
when Daddy calls at the last minute.

14:53.460 --> 14:54.810
Hannah!

14:55.300 --> 15:00.690
Phillipe, l am so sorry
l called at the last minute!

15:02.300 --> 15:06.050
Don't give it a second thought.
Table for Miss Montana!

15:08.780 --> 15:10.330
Are you kidding?

15:10.980 --> 15:14.490
-lt's Hannah Montana!
-But he's Larry David.

15:14.540 --> 15:17.170
He created <i>Seinfel</i> d
and <i>curb Your Enthusiasm</i>.

15:17.220 --> 15:18.440
Sorry.

15:20.460 --> 15:22.650
Face it, Dad, she's bigger than you.

15:22.700 --> 15:25.210
l bet Uncle Jerry could get us in.

15:26.740 --> 15:28.490
Uncle Jerry?

15:29.580 --> 15:32.570
Why couldn't you say
it was your birthday? Come on!

15:32.940 --> 15:34.530
l'm just so glad
we're not fighting any more,

15:34.580 --> 15:35.640
and, you know,
once you get to know Lucas,

15:35.700 --> 15:37.930
l know you guys are going
to be really close friends.

15:37.980 --> 15:40.280
l feel close to him already.

15:46.380 --> 15:51.450
Dude, that's Hannah Montana,
and she's totally checking me out.

15:52.380 --> 15:54.370
You're kidding! Where?

16:00.860 --> 16:04.050
l'm sorry that l'm late, Lisa.

16:04.100 --> 16:06.480
Yes, l'm leaving the shack right now.

16:06.540 --> 16:09.100
Come on, baby. All right, bye.

16:09.140 --> 16:10.850
<i>Alarm activated</i>.

16:13.500 --> 16:14.720
Keys.

16:17.860 --> 16:21.010
<i>lntruder alert. Activate deep freeze</i>.

16:21.060 --> 16:22.330
Oh, no.

16:24.180 --> 16:27.770
Jackson! l got the security alert.
What did they steal?

16:28.860 --> 16:31.530
All the heat in my body.

16:32.980 --> 16:34.890
Now that is cool.

16:39.820 --> 16:42.930
That's it, Rico.

16:42.980 --> 16:45.650
l quit.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.410
Let's not do anything hasty.

16:48.460 --> 16:50.730
Here's a couple of hot dogs on me.

16:55.540 --> 16:56.810
So warm.

16:57.260 --> 17:00.250
And l'm gonna need you to sign these.

17:01.780 --> 17:04.130
-What are they?
-Nothing.

17:04.180 --> 17:08.369
lt's just some release forms
saying l'm not responsible

17:08.420 --> 17:10.690
for any bodily injuries,
emotional trauma...

17:13.220 --> 17:15.010
Rico, why are you doing this?

17:15.060 --> 17:17.130
l mean, you spent a fortune
on a security system

17:17.180 --> 17:19.530
because of a $ 7 pair of sunglasses,

17:19.579 --> 17:23.359
and all it's done is kill your business
and freezer-burn my butt!

17:23.660 --> 17:26.690
-lt doesn't make any sense.
-lt does to me.

17:26.740 --> 17:29.690
l don't want anyone thinking
they can take advantage of me

17:29.740 --> 17:30.960
because of my size.

17:31.020 --> 17:32.570
l don't care how much it costs,

17:32.620 --> 17:37.210
no human being
will ever rip Rico off again.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.360
l don't think humans are your problem.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.530
l hope he enjoys it.

17:48.580 --> 17:51.730
That hot dog cost me $ 1 1 ,000.

17:59.220 --> 18:02.450
l am so sorry. Great hair.

18:04.180 --> 18:05.490
Did you see that? That was a move.

18:05.540 --> 18:08.770
Not just a move.
That was a hair-touch move.

18:08.820 --> 18:11.090
You're right. She wants me.

18:12.420 --> 18:15.170
lt's too bad l'm going with Lilly.

18:16.460 --> 18:20.370
l got two words for you, my brother.
Guy code.

18:20.420 --> 18:22.650
We are men, and we are hunters,

18:22.700 --> 18:26.850
and what happens in the jungle,
it stays in the jungle.

18:28.620 --> 18:30.130
Dude, you rock.

18:30.180 --> 18:32.770
Hey, if things work out,
l'll hook you up with her friend.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.490
Fingers crossed.

18:37.460 --> 18:40.650
Look, Justin Timberlake's eating
the same shrimp as me.

18:40.700 --> 18:43.210
Hey, Justin. Great shrimp, huh?

18:47.020 --> 18:49.320
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

18:49.820 --> 18:52.770
You've got your flirty face on.
Who is he?

18:53.380 --> 18:56.850
ls it that guy, or that guy,

18:56.900 --> 18:59.650
or Lucas, or Oliver, or...

19:03.620 --> 19:05.890
You're despicable!

19:05.940 --> 19:09.290
Lilly, l had to do something
to show you l wasn't lying.

19:09.340 --> 19:11.770
The only thing you've shown me
is that we're no longer friends.

19:11.820 --> 19:14.250
l am leaving, and l'm taking the shrimp.

19:14.300 --> 19:18.330
No, no, no. Lilly, l was just trying
to protect you from getting hurt.

19:18.380 --> 19:20.210
The only one who's hurting me is you.

19:20.260 --> 19:23.250
You just can't accept the fact
that Lucas really cares about me.

19:23.300 --> 19:24.360
Oh, yeah?

19:24.420 --> 19:27.890
Then why is he coming over here
to flirt with Hannah?

19:29.900 --> 19:33.250
He's coming over here to tell you
to stop making googly eyes at him,

19:33.300 --> 19:35.130
because he has a girlfriend.

19:35.180 --> 19:37.450
Hi, Hannah. l'm Lucas.

19:37.500 --> 19:40.850
l noticed you looking at me, and l...

19:40.900 --> 19:42.690
Go ahead, just say it.

19:42.740 --> 19:45.930
Yeah, tell her how you really feel.

19:45.980 --> 19:50.690
-Well, the truth is...
-Excuse me, Miss Fontana.

19:50.740 --> 19:53.610
l have your biggest fan right here.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.010
-Grandma.
-lt's okay, sweetheart.

19:56.060 --> 19:59.570
She's a celebrity.
This is why they go out in public.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.970
Don't go anywhere.
This will just take a second.

20:06.260 --> 20:08.890
-There you go, sweetie.
-Thank you.

20:08.940 --> 20:11.050
-You were saying?
-Well...

20:11.100 --> 20:16.120
l have a camera right here.
Let's take pictures. Okay.

20:16.180 --> 20:18.560
-l'm kind of in the middle of...
-No, no, sweetie pie.

20:18.620 --> 20:22.730
lt'll just take a second. Okay?
All right, now. Smile.

20:22.780 --> 20:24.330
Other way.

20:24.860 --> 20:26.530
Other way.

20:26.580 --> 20:29.490
-There you go, Grandma.
-That's so sweet.

20:30.740 --> 20:33.610
No, the lighting isn't good in here.

20:33.660 --> 20:37.530
lt's better in the bathroom. Let's go.
Come on.

20:37.580 --> 20:39.410
-Grandma!
-Grandma!

20:39.460 --> 20:40.970
Don't whine.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.770
Just tell her what you were gonna say.

20:47.500 --> 20:49.050
Yeah.

20:50.900 --> 20:53.280
What was that you were gonna say?

20:53.340 --> 20:57.410
Could you just give her my number
and tell her to call any time?

20:59.660 --> 21:01.010
Why?

21:01.900 --> 21:04.250
To tell her you have a girlfriend?
'Cause, you know,

21:04.300 --> 21:08.570
you look like the kind of guy who has
a girlfriend he really, really likes.

21:08.620 --> 21:11.930
-Actually l've got two.
-Two?

21:11.980 --> 21:14.770
Yeah, but l'd dump them both
for Hannah.

21:16.180 --> 21:17.570
So funny.

21:22.180 --> 21:23.400
Well, in that case,

21:23.460 --> 21:26.210
l know Hannah would want me
to give you a little something, too.

21:26.260 --> 21:28.330
-Sweet.
-Yeah.

21:31.380 --> 21:33.290
Yeah, it is sweet.

21:37.340 --> 21:41.290
-You really got that boy back good.
-That was just Lola.

21:41.340 --> 21:43.930
Wait till Lilly gets a hold of him.

21:48.060 --> 21:49.850
Lilly, l'm really sorry.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.930
Yeah, l'm sorry l didn't believe you.

21:51.980 --> 21:54.770
Man, boys can really mess things up,
can't they?

21:54.820 --> 21:55.850
Yeah,

21:55.900 --> 21:59.250
and you can't live with them,
can't eat with them.

22:02.380 --> 22:04.650
Well, what are we gonna do
next time one of us has a boyfriend?

22:04.700 --> 22:07.000
The only thing we can do.
Trust each other.

22:07.060 --> 22:08.970
-Deal?
-Deal.

22:09.020 --> 22:11.170
Oh, my goodness.

22:11.740 --> 22:14.010
lt's Natalie Portman.

22:15.820 --> 22:18.850
Lannah, be a doll, take our picture.

22:19.780 --> 22:22.610
You know, you're not as cute in person.
