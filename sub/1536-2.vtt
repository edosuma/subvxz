00:01.000 --> 00:02.206
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.360 --> 00:05.125
Police Captain Sean Renard, three
right upper, left lower.

00:05.200 --> 00:07.487
Did the Captain say what was in the
bottle that he wanted me to take?

00:07.560 --> 00:08.891
He just said you
had to drink it,

00:08.960 --> 00:10.291
or something
really bad would happen.

00:10.400 --> 00:11.401
And Adalind did it.

00:11.480 --> 00:12.606
I just found out
where Adalind is.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.568
She boarded
Lufthansa flight to Vienna.

00:14.640 --> 00:15.926
She's going back to the Royals.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.160
She thinks you have the child.

00:17.200 --> 00:18.531
Which may not be a bad thing.

00:18.960 --> 00:21.611
I know you.
Criminology student, right?

00:21.880 --> 00:22.880
Uh, yeah.

00:22.960 --> 00:24.007
Theresa's been staying with us.

00:24.120 --> 00:25.531
Did you see what happened?
Yes.

00:25.680 --> 00:27.160
She killed the shooter.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.000
You cannot run.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.280
You left the scene of a crime.

00:33.320 --> 00:34.446
To get Nick.

00:34.720 --> 00:36.006
I think she's telling the truth.

00:37.640 --> 00:39.000
Henry Slocombe.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.441
Dr. Anderson.

00:40.560 --> 00:42.324
Danny has been in
a terrible accident.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.289
Some sort of severe head injury.

00:44.360 --> 00:46.044
The Gedachtnis Esser.
Wha...

00:46.120 --> 00:49.363
The nature of our defensive
resources could be compromised.

00:49.640 --> 00:52.405
"It is not known how this Wesen
removes the memories of its victims,

00:52.480 --> 00:53.641
"only that it can."

00:53.800 --> 00:56.451
This is a key piece
to the CVA project.

00:56.560 --> 00:57.840
Just hurry up
and get to Vickers.

00:57.920 --> 00:59.126
ICU. Code Blue to ICU.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.326
Excuse me, O2 line up.

01:00.440 --> 01:01.646
...three hundred.

01:01.720 --> 01:02.881
He's asystolic.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.843
- Pulse shock's flat.
- We're losing him.

01:07.480 --> 01:09.403
- Clear!
- I got no response.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.601
Nothing.

01:10.760 --> 01:14.128
All right, let's call it. Time of
death, 1:34 p.m.

01:18.680 --> 01:21.251
"A Man's real possession
is his memory.

01:21.320 --> 01:25.006
"In nothing else is he rich,
In nothing else is he poor."

01:30.640 --> 01:33.291
Ma'am, please do not
come in here right now.

02:08.560 --> 02:11.450
...to post-op.
Cardiology to post-op...

02:11.520 --> 02:13.170
Are you all right?

02:14.520 --> 02:15.521
VIENNA

02:15.680 --> 02:17.284
All payments to Weston
Steward were cash deposits

02:17.360 --> 02:19.044
made by a courier from Lisbon.

02:19.280 --> 02:20.964
The courier was
an independent contractor

02:21.040 --> 02:23.202
with no idea
the cash came from us.

02:24.360 --> 02:27.728
Are there any wild cards? The
King will be out for blood.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.801
Whose blood depends on
how careful we are.

02:33.040 --> 02:34.041
Take it.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.441
Ja?

02:39.720 --> 02:41.529
Are you sure it's her?

02:42.240 --> 02:43.685
It's Adalind Schade.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.091
I'll ring her back.

02:45.360 --> 02:47.442
No, sir, she's here.

02:47.560 --> 02:48.891
In Vienna?

02:49.160 --> 02:50.241
At the gate.

02:58.800 --> 03:02.202
Adalind,
how nice to see you again.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.449
You bring good news I hope.

03:05.800 --> 03:07.609
I did it, I did what you asked.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.320
You took the Grimm's powers?

03:09.400 --> 03:10.606
I did.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.921
We will need confirmation
that what you did

03:13.000 --> 03:15.367
to Mr. Burkhardt
actually succeeded.

03:15.680 --> 03:18.331
It worked.
I swear it worked.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.164
Well, there's a bit of
conflicting information.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.129
You see, one of our
operatives had his head

03:22.200 --> 03:24.089
lopped off at
Mr. Burkhardt's house.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.485
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

03:27.680 --> 03:28.966
No.
No.

03:29.280 --> 03:31.044
But I did what I had to do.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.202
I did what you wanted me to do.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.644
Please let me in.

03:38.160 --> 03:39.321
Please.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.884
I need to see my baby.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.525
What do you think?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.161
I doubt she would
have come all this way

03:45.240 --> 03:47.686
without attempting to
accomplish what you asked.

03:48.960 --> 03:50.644
I'll get confirmation.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.690
Please, Viktor.

03:55.640 --> 03:57.483
I need my baby.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.642
All right, open the gates.

04:03.080 --> 04:04.491
Is the west wing ready?

04:04.840 --> 04:06.046
I'll make sure it is.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.889
You can stay there.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.526
You're going to be
with us for quite some time.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.370
Thank you, Viktor.

04:12.680 --> 04:14.205
- How is she?
- Wonderful.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.127
How's Juliette
handling this?

04:40.000 --> 04:42.207
She's trying not to blame me.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.371
You ought to try
doing the same thing.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.121
Go ahead, Trubel.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.891
Octopus Head is checking into
the Multnomah Hotel.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.210
We're on our way.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.450
Has she gained
any weight?

05:03.520 --> 05:04.880
She's been eating okay,
hasn't she?

05:05.000 --> 05:07.048
Oh, she has quite an appetite.

05:07.160 --> 05:08.889
Who's taking care of her?
We all are.

05:08.960 --> 05:12.169
She's very important and it's
rather nice having her here,

05:12.240 --> 05:14.083
she's brightened
up the whole castle.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.324
Ha! I do wish I could have seen
the look on Mr. Burkhardt's face

05:17.400 --> 05:19.846
when he realized
he'd slept with you.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.803
How was it, by the way?

05:22.880 --> 05:24.564
I did what I had to do.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.490
I did it for my baby.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.846
It wasn't fun.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.251
That's a shame.

05:29.360 --> 05:32.091
It's not every day a Grimm
shags a Hexenbiest.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.767
Or was it the other way around?

05:36.960 --> 05:38.325
Where are we?

05:38.680 --> 05:40.250
Why are we down here?

05:40.600 --> 05:42.568
This is the most
secure part of the castle.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.768
No one can get to
your child here.

05:45.440 --> 05:48.762
By the by, did you know
Sean Renard is in hospital?

05:49.480 --> 05:50.606
What happened?

05:50.680 --> 05:52.284
He was tragically shot

05:52.360 --> 05:53.885
at Mr. Burkhardt's home.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.286
Nick shot him?

05:56.360 --> 05:57.600
Actually, no.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.247
HOW is he?

06:01.280 --> 06:02.930
Hanging on by a thread.

06:04.920 --> 06:07.446
I know how close
you and Sean were.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.530
Right his way, dear.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.964
Where's my baby?

06:20.040 --> 06:21.530
I don't have your baby.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.409
It was taken from
me by the Resistance.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.801
The very people who helped
you escape from me.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.968
Now, don't you
regret that decision?

06:30.800 --> 06:32.643
You can huff and
puff all you want,

06:32.720 --> 06:34.563
you're not going to
blow this house down.

06:36.840 --> 06:37.887
Viktor!

06:38.000 --> 06:40.128
It was built for Hexenbiests.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.725
Viktor,
don't do this!

06:42.160 --> 06:43.844
Viktor!

06:44.040 --> 06:45.371
You bastard!

06:45.440 --> 06:47.124
You can't do this!

06:47.640 --> 06:50.166
I did what you wanted me to do!

07:23.200 --> 07:24.611
All right.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.251
Here you are,
Mr. Anderson.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.448
You are on the fourth floor.
Elevators are to your right.

07:28.520 --> 07:29.885
Thank you.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.920
Hi, this is Henry.
I can't get to the phone,

08:46.960 --> 08:48.450
so please leave me a message.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.206
Henry, it's Kent.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.851
I don't know where you are,
I've been trying to reach you.

08:53.120 --> 08:55.009
Get back to me as
soon as you can.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.929
I'm heading home, call me there.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.163
Hey. He checked
into room 402.

09:10.360 --> 09:12.328
How'd you find that out?

09:12.440 --> 09:14.169
You're kidding, right?

09:14.280 --> 09:15.281
We know he's
the guy we're after.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.725
But now we're going to need
some background on him

09:16.800 --> 09:18.768
to see how he
connects with the victims.

09:18.840 --> 09:20.365
All we got is he can
steal people's memories.

09:20.440 --> 09:21.566
And their cars.

09:21.840 --> 09:23.569
Why don't we just go in there
and take him down right now?

09:23.680 --> 09:25.045
'Cause we don't
have any evidence

09:25.120 --> 09:26.406
or motive that
ties him to the crime.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.160
Yeah, I wasn't talking
about arresting him.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.965
Just keep an eye on him.
Let us know if he moves.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.441
And nothing more.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.450
All right.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.686
Hey, you got any
money for lunch?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.968
Make it last.
Thank you.

09:45.840 --> 09:47.569
Hey, I need a receipt.

09:47.640 --> 09:48.687
All right.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.844
She'll be fine.
Let's go.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.171
Nothing.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.526
I know. Me neither.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.524
The Verfluchte Zwillingsschwester
is a really badass spell.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.760
I don't think we're going to
find anything in my books.

10:19.080 --> 10:22.243
You know what? This is beyond
anything I've ever dealt with.

10:22.320 --> 10:24.084
What if we can't
help Nick this time?

10:24.280 --> 10:26.009
Honey, all we can do is try.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.128
The Captain must have
known what Adalind did,

10:28.200 --> 10:30.089
because he brought
something to give to Nick.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.282
But how do we find
out what that was?

10:32.400 --> 10:34.448
I don't know.

10:35.640 --> 10:37.802
Find out where
Adalind cooked it up.

10:37.880 --> 10:39.041
Yeah.

10:39.360 --> 10:41.044
And reverse engineer it.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.730
Nick is still a cop. Right?

10:42.800 --> 10:44.643
Can't he figure out
where the Captain was

10:44.720 --> 10:45.960
before he went to Nick's house?

10:46.160 --> 10:47.889
I mean, he had to get
the stuff somewhere.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.449
Unless he made it himself, because
he is a Zauberbiest, after all.

10:52.920 --> 10:53.967
Right.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.325
Zauberbiest.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.683
Kent,
thanks for stopping by.

11:37.800 --> 11:38.926
I moved out.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.643
Laurie and I are
getting divorced.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.046
It's been coming a long time.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.485
Kent,
that is awful news.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.802
Let me give you my new number
and address.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.283
Hello?
Hi.

12:16.360 --> 12:20.922
This is Lawrence
Anderson, is this Captain Vickers?

12:21.680 --> 12:22.841
Yes.

12:22.920 --> 12:26.208
I worked on the CVA project
with Henry Slocombe.

12:27.240 --> 12:29.971
Have you seen him?
I'm trying to locate him.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.247
Actually, actually,
that's why I'm calling.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.322
He's been in an accident.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.087
How bad?

12:37.160 --> 12:38.161
It isn't good.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.011
He has a very
serious head injury.

12:41.120 --> 12:45.648
Alexandra, his girlfriend,
I don't know if you know her,

12:45.720 --> 12:50.362
she was found murdered
in his house.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.121
What?

12:52.200 --> 12:55.204
Look, I don't wanna
do this on the phone.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.448
How about I come
over to your place

12:57.520 --> 13:00.285
and I can just fill
you in on everything.

13:00.360 --> 13:01.600
Good idea.

13:01.680 --> 13:06.402
I'm, I'm up in Northeast,
2411 Sixty-fifth.

13:07.360 --> 13:08.361
I'm on my way.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.490
Sean.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.326
Mother.

14:28.240 --> 14:29.526
I'm having a problem
with Lawrence Anderson's

14:29.600 --> 14:30.886
motor vehicle records.

14:30.960 --> 14:32.166
They're not coming up.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.881
I got an address
match in Seattle.

14:34.960 --> 14:37.930
And it looks like he works at
Satellite Defense Technologies.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.490
Do we know what that is?

14:40.840 --> 14:42.365
We'll find out.

14:45.440 --> 14:46.440
Got it.

14:46.480 --> 14:47.481
SDT.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.528
They're heavy in aerospace
and defense technology.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.563
Same kind of work Dr.
Slocombe was involved with.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.165
Maybe there's a connection.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.811
Let's see what kind of
employee Lawrence Anderson is.

15:13.480 --> 15:17.565
And when did the accident take place?
Okay, and what was the injury?

15:20.200 --> 15:21.326
Yeah... Hold on,
I'm going to put you

15:21.440 --> 15:22.965
on speaker so my
partner can hear this.

15:24.920 --> 15:25.921
Go ahead.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.960
Yeah, I was just
saying it's a real tragedy

15:28.000 --> 15:30.082
what happened to Lawrence
a couple of weeks ago.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.362
He suffered some
kind of head injury.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.046
Can you describe the injury?

15:34.280 --> 15:36.851
I can describe it,
but I can't explain it.

15:37.360 --> 15:40.842
Nobody can. He got four wounds
to the back of his head.

15:42.960 --> 15:45.088
Was he able to tell
anybody what happened?

15:45.240 --> 15:47.527
No,
that's the real sad part.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.762
It's like he's
suffering from dementia.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.809
He was one of the smartest
men I've ever met.

15:52.360 --> 15:55.170
MIT, Harvard,
Military Intelligence.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.569
He was involved with
Military Intelligence?

15:57.640 --> 15:59.210
Oh, yeah,
top security clearance.

15:59.440 --> 16:02.683
Intimately involved with some pretty
important government programs.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.521
Now he doesn't even recognize
his own daughter.

16:05.600 --> 16:06.647
Can we talk to her?

16:06.720 --> 16:09.564
Sure. I'm going to put you on
hold while I get her number.

16:12.960 --> 16:15.167
So the guy we're following
isn't Lawrence Anderson.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.844
So we got Slocombe
and Lawrence Anderson,

16:16.920 --> 16:18.604
both working for
defense contractors.

16:18.920 --> 16:20.331
This guy's not just
stealing memories.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.209
No, he's stealing secrets.

16:22.280 --> 16:23.520
So he's a Wesen spy?

16:23.600 --> 16:24.726
And there's no way to prove what

16:24.800 --> 16:26.165
he's stealing 'cause
it's all in his head.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.129
Which means the CIA or the NSA

16:28.200 --> 16:30.567
will never know the extent of what
he's got or what they've lost.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.369
How do you explain
that to the Feds?

16:32.440 --> 16:34.966
I don't know, but we
may get a chance to try.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.050
Here's Chavez.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.724
Now what?

16:38.800 --> 16:40.211
Burkhardt, got a few minutes?

16:40.280 --> 16:41.566
We need to talk.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.561
Someplace private.

16:44.640 --> 16:46.324
All right.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.284
Trubel, this is Hank.
Is he still at the hotel?

16:54.360 --> 16:55.930
No, he left. He's on a bus.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.127
Where are you?

16:57.200 --> 16:58.281
I'm with him.

16:58.440 --> 16:59.930
Look, he dyed his hair
and he's wearing glasses.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.520
I might not have recognized him
if he didn't come out of 402.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.681
You were supposed
to stay at the hotel.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.090
Hank, I got this.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.400
He's getting off at
Sandy and Sixty-sixth.

17:09.440 --> 17:10.930
Listen, this guy's dangerous.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.848
Keep your distance and
check in every 15 minutes.

17:14.920 --> 17:15.967
Got it.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.166
Is this on the record?

17:38.240 --> 17:39.240
Off.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.282
Just between you and me.

17:42.480 --> 17:43.641
So what are we doing here?

17:43.720 --> 17:45.484
Why was Captain
Renard in your house?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.411
I told you, I don't know.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.767
Did you know FBI
Agent Weston Steward?

17:50.160 --> 17:51.160
No.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.771
Do you know why Steward would
want to kill Captain Renard?

17:53.840 --> 17:54.841
No.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.411
You understand the
problem here, Detective?

17:58.480 --> 18:01.689
Your captain was shot in your
house by one of our agents.

18:02.800 --> 18:05.531
Sounds more like
your problem than mine.

18:06.240 --> 18:08.208
Agent Steward went off the grid.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.845
We don't know why.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.400
Next thing, he shows
up dead in your house.

18:12.480 --> 18:15.643
An FBI agent with no
connection to a police captain

18:15.720 --> 18:19.520
suggests to me that he was working
for or with somebody else.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.443
You think there's a conspiracy.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.921
Unless you have
a better word for it.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.130
Why don't you tell
me about the young lady

18:27.200 --> 18:30.124
living in your house,
Theresa Rubel.

18:30.200 --> 18:35.127
From what I've found out,
she's had a few problems.

18:35.480 --> 18:38.051
Yeah, and I've been trying to
help get her straightened out.

18:38.720 --> 18:41.041
She's awfully
handy with a machete.

18:41.480 --> 18:45.565
Look, she's had some
serious abuse issues.

18:46.440 --> 18:49.205
I've been teaching her
how to defend herself.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.521
I didn't expect her to
have to use it so soon.

18:51.720 --> 18:54.564
She's spent time in
mental institutions.

18:54.640 --> 18:55.846
I assume you know that.

18:55.920 --> 18:59.049
She's been through some tough
times, but she's a good kid.

19:04.960 --> 19:07.884
And if she hadn't killed your
agent, she'd be dead right now.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.002
Is there anything
else you want to tell me?

19:17.080 --> 19:20.129
This is your party,
I'm just a guest.

19:33.560 --> 19:35.927
Not exactly your
average stone-cold killer.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.485
She doesn't look very old.

19:37.560 --> 19:39.130
Thinking 19 to 21.

19:39.240 --> 19:40.924
Going on deadly.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.244
This is Theresa,
criminology student.

19:43.320 --> 19:45.004
She's here for a ride along.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.402
Uh-ho. Thinking of
becoming a cop?

20:16.280 --> 20:18.362
You gotta be kidding me.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.045
What a shame.

20:26.840 --> 20:29.525
Recipe's been in my
family for generations.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.244
Not that it's any good.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.448
More of a tradition
than anything else.

20:35.320 --> 20:37.607
How long do you plan on
keeping her in there?

20:37.720 --> 20:39.404
Until she gives
up every member of

20:39.480 --> 20:41.084
the Resistance who
helped her escape.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.209
You know, even in her current condition,
she's still quite attractive.

20:46.560 --> 20:48.324
Let the game begin.

20:49.360 --> 20:52.807
Can you tell me what level of
security clearance Dr. Slocombe has?

20:54.920 --> 20:58.242
Uh, do you know if he's
ever had any connection to

20:58.360 --> 21:01.170
Satellite Defense
Technologies in Seattle?

21:02.400 --> 21:06.371
All right, but if you could get
back to me, I'd appreciate it.

21:06.440 --> 21:07.771
Thanks.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.285
Got a minute?

21:09.360 --> 21:10.600
Yeah, what's up?

21:11.720 --> 21:14.200
Can I ask you something about the
girl staying at Nick's house?

21:15.680 --> 21:18.684
Theresa Rubel?
Yeah, what about her?

21:18.760 --> 21:20.569
She's a criminology
student, right?

21:24.840 --> 21:25.841
Yeah.

21:26.240 --> 21:27.241
Um...

21:27.560 --> 21:29.881
I'm just having a little problem
trying to figure out why she's at...

21:29.960 --> 21:31.644
You know, we're going to have
to talk about this later.

21:31.720 --> 21:34.564
We're in the middle
of an investigation.

21:37.240 --> 21:38.651
We gotta go.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.608
Wu was starting
to figure it out.

21:42.680 --> 21:43.681
What'd you tell him?

21:43.760 --> 21:44.761
Nothing yet.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.520
But I don't know how much longer
we're going to get away with that.

21:47.680 --> 21:49.045
How'd it go with the FBI?

21:49.600 --> 21:51.602
I don't know,
it wasn't about Anderson.

21:51.720 --> 21:53.688
Seemed like there was something
going on, not sure what.

21:53.760 --> 21:55.046
Well, I got something.

21:55.720 --> 21:58.291
Slocombe has top security clearance,
just like Lawrence Anderson.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.561
And Trubel called.

21:59.640 --> 22:02.246
Our Lawrence left the hotel,
and he changed his appearance.

22:03.240 --> 22:05.208
She's following him.
Yep.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.327
She was supposed to...

22:06.400 --> 22:09.324
We all know what she
was supposed to do.

22:10.480 --> 22:13.689
I just saw Burkhardt.
He's not the Grimm.

22:13.760 --> 22:15.888
I'm sure, I Woged
right in front of him.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.327
I think I know who the Grimm is.

22:18.440 --> 22:19.771
I'm going to make sure.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.967
Can we talk?
Sure, of course, come on in.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.241
What's wrong?

22:43.320 --> 22:45.527
I mean, other than
everything that's not right.

22:47.720 --> 22:51.202
Hey, Juliette, I'm so sorry.
We haven't found anything.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.447
That's why I'm here.

22:52.520 --> 22:54.204
I mean, we've been doing
everything we can with the...

22:54.280 --> 22:57.807
I know, but maybe
you shouldn't be.

22:58.640 --> 22:59.641
What?

23:01.160 --> 23:03.208
I don't understand.
We're really...

23:03.280 --> 23:04.930
I just think maybe we shouldn't

23:05.000 --> 23:06.889
be in such a hurry to fix this.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.600
You don't want us to help Nick?

23:11.640 --> 23:14.803
No, no, no, no. It's not that I
don't want you to help Nick,

23:16.320 --> 23:18.561
but being a Grimm
hasn't exactly been

23:18.640 --> 23:22.486
the greatest
thing for him or me.

23:26.320 --> 23:28.800
And Nick isn't so sure
he wants this anymore.

23:31.960 --> 23:35.965
So what I'm trying to say is maybe
we should just give it a little time

23:36.040 --> 23:40.489
to see if not being a Grimm
is better than being one.

23:44.520 --> 23:47.364
You know, there's a chance for us
to have a normal life together.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.371
Now, wait a minute.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.250
Knowing what Nick knows,

23:51.320 --> 23:53.049
honestly, do you think
that's possible?

23:53.200 --> 23:55.521
Just because he can't see us
doesn't mean he doesn't know.

23:55.880 --> 23:57.769
But shouldn't
that be his decision?

23:58.200 --> 23:59.690
I mean, you guys have both
been such great friends,

23:59.760 --> 24:02.843
no matter what happens,
that's not gonna change.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.321
I just need a little
time to think about this.

24:08.680 --> 24:09.681
Okay.

24:11.520 --> 24:13.010
Thank you.

24:17.240 --> 24:19.208
How much time is a little time?

24:20.360 --> 24:24.331
I don't know, but I think we
need to keep looking anyway.

24:38.640 --> 24:40.130
You're really here.

24:44.120 --> 24:46.088
I thought it was a dream.

24:48.240 --> 24:50.242
I'm just glad I made it in time.

24:55.080 --> 24:56.411
I was dead.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.240
For a moment.

24:59.680 --> 25:02.047
I suppose that's the second
time you've given me life.

25:02.240 --> 25:04.561
It hurt a lot
more the first time.

25:06.160 --> 25:08.083
Who did this to you?

25:09.360 --> 25:15.367
Weston Steward, a Hundjager
working with the Royal family.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.650
The Family again.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.448
Will they never leave us alone?

25:20.520 --> 25:21.851
No.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.571
I would like very much to
meet this Weston Steward.

25:25.120 --> 25:28.567
I just remembered,
I was supposed to give

25:28.640 --> 25:31.450
something very important
to Nick Burkhardt.

25:31.520 --> 25:33.807
He's the Grimm I told you about,

25:33.880 --> 25:35.120
I need to speak with him.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.851
You don't need to do
anything except get better.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.490
You don't understand.

25:42.560 --> 25:43.766
Adalind was with him.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.569
Adalind, Catherine's daughter?

25:45.680 --> 25:49.526
Yes, and she used a Verfluchte
Zwillingsschwester.

25:50.600 --> 25:56.130
There's one more thing.
A child. A girl.

25:57.480 --> 25:58.891
Whose child?

25:58.960 --> 26:00.644
Adalind's...

26:02.760 --> 26:04.364
And mine.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.289
So I'm a grandmother.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.810
Not that you look it.

26:15.160 --> 26:17.322
When do I get to see her?

26:36.360 --> 26:37.521
Nick.
Where are you?

26:37.680 --> 26:39.409
I'm still following him.
He's going after someone else.

26:39.480 --> 26:40.481
How do you know?

26:40.560 --> 26:41.561
'Cause I heard him
making a phone call,

26:41.640 --> 26:45.690
he said he was gonna tell somebody
about an accident and a murder.

26:46.520 --> 26:49.285
Trubel, listen, we don't
know who this guy is.

26:49.480 --> 26:51.323
I do not want you
getting close to him.

26:51.880 --> 26:53.166
Damn it, I lost him.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.010
Tell me exactly where you are.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.367
Um, Sixty-fifth and Alameda.

26:57.440 --> 26:58.885
Stay put, we're on our way.

27:13.160 --> 27:16.289
He accessed it from off-site,
that's the problem.

27:16.360 --> 27:18.567
Look, Dr. Slocombe
had an accident.

27:18.680 --> 27:21.729
I don't know the details, I'm about
to find out.

27:22.920 --> 27:24.046
I'll call you back.

27:28.720 --> 27:30.529
Anderson?
Yes.

27:30.600 --> 27:31.931
Come in.

27:33.400 --> 27:34.640
This way.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.406
Tell me what happened.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.170
Well, no one knows
for sure, but we

27:49.240 --> 27:51.004
think it was some
sort of home invasion.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.165
Oh, my God.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.242
He's at Treeview Hospital.

27:56.640 --> 27:58.688
He doesn't remember anything.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.286
Doesn't even remember
his own name.

28:02.120 --> 28:04.646
How can something
like this happen?

28:05.920 --> 28:10.130
Um, I'm sorry, could I trouble
you for a glass of water?

28:11.600 --> 28:13.284
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

28:33.280 --> 28:34.805
Do they have any suspects?

28:36.360 --> 28:37.771
Not that I know of.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.365
This is where
Trubel said she'd be.

29:18.480 --> 29:19.845
Where the hell is she?

29:19.920 --> 29:21.524
This is why I don't have kids.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.371
She's not answering.

29:37.280 --> 29:39.044
Maybe she's still following him.

29:39.120 --> 29:40.770
What if he made her?

29:40.880 --> 29:42.120
I can't keep dragging her
into things like this,

29:42.200 --> 29:43.361
she's going to get hurt.

29:43.440 --> 29:44.601
All right, slow down.

29:44.720 --> 29:47.849
We go back to the hotel, see if we
can find something in his room.

29:58.960 --> 29:59.961
Ahhh!

30:32.600 --> 30:34.523
I just want my baby.

30:36.840 --> 30:38.604
I just want my baby.

30:42.360 --> 30:44.442
I just want my baby.

30:58.120 --> 30:59.770
Who's there?

31:03.920 --> 31:05.365
Who are you?

31:06.960 --> 31:09.008
I know you're there.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.728
Please talk to me.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.611
My name is Adalind.

31:18.680 --> 31:21.160
My name is for me
to know and you to find out.

32:02.360 --> 32:04.567
That's a good girl.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.085
You've been following me.

32:10.120 --> 32:11.849
Too young to be a cop.

32:12.480 --> 32:15.882
No ID, $6.75 in your wallet,

32:15.960 --> 32:18.088
and a receipt for
two Italian subs,

32:18.160 --> 32:20.208
you must have been very hungry.

32:20.400 --> 32:23.802
Now why would somebody
like you be following me?

32:28.320 --> 32:31.529
No matter, I'll find out.

32:32.040 --> 32:36.090
It's all in there.

32:55.200 --> 32:57.168
Mr. Anderson,
it's the hotel manager.

32:57.240 --> 32:58.844
I have to open the door.

32:58.920 --> 32:59.967
I'll do it.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.609
He's not violent,
is he?

33:09.840 --> 33:10.841
Nothing in here.

33:10.920 --> 33:12.285
No suitcase,
no clothes.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.562
He wasn't planning on staying.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.684
Hank. Got an address.

33:20.760 --> 33:22.649
2411 Northeast,
Sixty-fifth Street.

33:22.720 --> 33:24.688
Right where she was.
Let's go.

33:24.760 --> 33:26.091
What'll I do if he comes back?

33:26.160 --> 33:27.241
Call the police!

34:04.640 --> 34:08.440
You can lie all you want, but
I'll get the truth out of you.

34:48.040 --> 34:51.840
Oh, God,
you're a Grimm! No!

34:52.000 --> 34:54.367
Oh, God! Oh, God!

34:56.840 --> 34:59.320
Oh, God! Oh, God!

35:00.520 --> 35:01.601
Hank!

35:03.680 --> 35:05.205
Get down!

35:09.520 --> 35:11.170
Trubel!

35:11.800 --> 35:13.768
Do you know who I am?

35:14.720 --> 35:17.041
Yeah, Nick, I know who you are.

35:17.520 --> 35:20.251
My head hurts. You better
check on him over there.

35:20.320 --> 35:23.529
I kicked Octopus Head off him.
I hope it wasn't too late.

35:26.800 --> 35:28.962
Come on. I'm gonna put you
in the chair.

35:30.880 --> 35:31.961
What're you doing?

35:32.040 --> 35:33.485
You're bleeding.

35:33.720 --> 35:35.643
Get...
Hey, no argument.

35:35.720 --> 35:37.006
Who are you?

35:37.080 --> 35:38.570
Police.

35:38.680 --> 35:40.011
Who are you?

35:40.080 --> 35:42.606
Kent Vickers.

35:42.960 --> 35:43.961
Where do you live?

35:44.040 --> 35:45.087
I live here.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.083
Why are you here?

35:48.320 --> 35:49.401
What's going on?

35:49.480 --> 35:52.609
Just stay where you are,
help is on its way.

36:01.480 --> 36:03.084
Does she know who she is?

36:03.960 --> 36:05.246
Yeah, Hank.

36:05.360 --> 36:06.964
I'm a Grimm.

36:07.680 --> 36:09.808
You know, you scared
the hell out of us.

36:10.320 --> 36:11.651
Sorry.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.882
Timothy Croftin Perkal.

36:20.960 --> 36:24.248
Canadian, wanted in Canada,
US and Great Britain

36:24.320 --> 36:25.401
for espionage.

36:25.480 --> 36:27.369
So we caught ourselves a spy.

36:28.280 --> 36:30.044
You know, I was just thinking,

36:30.120 --> 36:33.010
all that stuff he stole from
people's memories,

36:33.560 --> 36:35.961
what do you think
he got from Trubel?

36:41.520 --> 36:43.488
No!

36:44.320 --> 36:45.890
God!

36:53.560 --> 36:54.971
Hey, Captain.

36:55.040 --> 36:56.326
It's good to see you guys.

36:56.480 --> 36:57.891
You too.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.200
You look pretty
good for a guy who's

36:59.320 --> 37:00.890
been through what
you've been through.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.291
How are you feeling?

37:03.600 --> 37:05.329
Better than I was.

37:07.160 --> 37:11.165
Listen, Nick, did you get what I
brought to your house for you?

37:11.240 --> 37:12.651
No.

37:13.480 --> 37:15.084
It's gone.

37:18.360 --> 37:19.850
I'm not a Grimm anymore.

37:21.800 --> 37:24.565
Oh, Nick,

37:24.640 --> 37:27.211
- I'm sorry, I tried.
- I know.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.602
We can talk about this when
you're feeling a little stronger.

37:29.880 --> 37:31.882
I should've known
what Adalind was up to.

37:33.040 --> 37:34.929
I'm just glad the young
lady staying a tyour house

37:35.000 --> 37:37.526
knew how to handle a machete.

37:38.280 --> 37:39.645
I owe her.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.691
I'm just glad you're still here.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.444
So am I.

37:48.680 --> 37:50.284
Detectives Burkhardt
and Griffin,

37:50.360 --> 37:52.169
this is Elizabeth Lascelles.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.050
My mother.

37:58.160 --> 37:59.366
Oh!

37:59.440 --> 38:00.441
Hi.

38:02.880 --> 38:04.370
She's had a little work done.

38:08.520 --> 38:11.888
Trubel! You want some breakfast?
It's almost ready.

38:11.960 --> 38:13.689
Oh, I know.
I smelled it.

38:13.800 --> 38:15.928
Bacon.
That's all I want.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.168
How do you feel?

38:19.720 --> 38:23.884
Well, my neck hurts, but I haven't
slept that good in a long time.

38:24.520 --> 38:25.885
Hey, can I borrow your bike?

38:26.000 --> 38:27.126
Just take it.

38:27.240 --> 38:28.605
Thanks.

38:29.560 --> 38:31.767
Mmm. See you guys later.

38:32.480 --> 38:34.130
Hey, be careful.

38:34.560 --> 38:37.609
I know, I'm the only Grimm
in town, I'll watch it.

38:40.200 --> 38:42.521
How are you doing with all this?

38:43.080 --> 38:45.401
I don't know if using her
to help me is a good idea.

38:46.240 --> 38:48.049
It almost went really badly.

38:48.920 --> 38:49.921
She's a Grimm, Nick.

38:50.040 --> 38:51.451
She can't really avoid it.

38:51.520 --> 38:53.120
Even if she could,
I doubt it would last.

38:54.240 --> 38:56.288
I know, she's too much like you.

38:58.680 --> 38:59.886
Not anymore.

39:16.040 --> 39:17.565
I got it.

39:19.760 --> 39:20.761
Hey.

39:22.200 --> 39:23.531
Is it the Captain?
No.

39:23.600 --> 39:24.601
Um...

39:26.080 --> 39:27.605
What's the problem?

39:27.680 --> 39:29.205
We need to talk.

39:32.920 --> 39:34.206
Thanks.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.369
I couldn't sleep last night.

39:41.800 --> 39:43.404
I need you to take
a look at something.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.602
She's a suspect in
a double homicide

39:49.680 --> 39:51.648
and I'm having a bit
of a problem with this.

39:52.160 --> 39:54.481
You see, she was introduced to
me as a criminology student.

39:54.600 --> 39:55.920
And I'm pretty
sure she's the same

39:55.960 --> 39:57.320
young woman who's
staying with you.

39:57.600 --> 40:00.444
Can you clear this up for me?

40:04.640 --> 40:07.041
Look, it's complicated.

40:07.880 --> 40:09.405
I...

40:10.640 --> 40:13.291
You okay?

40:13.720 --> 40:16.007
Yeah, my head hurts.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.330
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

40:24.440 --> 40:25.407
Nick. Nick, Nick,
Nick, Nick. Nick.

40:25.520 --> 40:26.885
Hey, what's... I'm not... I don't know.
What happened?

40:32.000 --> 40:33.525
Juliette?

40:36.920 --> 40:38.001
What's going on?

40:38.160 --> 40:39.366
I can't see you.

40:40.240 --> 40:42.129
Okay.
I don't know where I am.

40:42.200 --> 40:43.406
Can you see anything?

40:44.960 --> 40:47.042
He fell down and he
said his head hurt.

40:54.560 --> 40:55.925
I'm not in the house.

40:56.240 --> 40:58.720
What do you... What do you mean?
Where are you?

41:02.360 --> 41:04.044
Hey! You all right?

41:05.520 --> 41:07.841
Buddy. Nick.
Nick. Nick, are you okay?

41:15.720 --> 41:17.484
What the hell?

41:20.600 --> 41:22.011
Juliette.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.445
You can see me?

41:23.520 --> 41:25.090
Yeah.

41:25.160 --> 41:27.049
Okay.
Let's get up. Let's get up.

41:28.120 --> 41:30.361
Come on. Let's go.

41:37.240 --> 41:38.685
You all right?

41:38.760 --> 41:40.091
I'm not sure.

41:42.680 --> 41:44.205
You said you
saw another place?

41:44.320 --> 41:45.560
Yeah.

41:45.640 --> 41:46.801
Where?

41:47.800 --> 41:49.609
I don't know.

42:06.960 --> 42:08.291
No!

42:08.600 --> 42:09.965
Get off of me!

42:12.280 --> 42:14.601
Go! Go!
