00:50.630 --> 00:52.210
Grace.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.220
I think I'm falling in love with you.

00:57.300 --> 00:58.760
Oh...

01:01.680 --> 01:04.519
That's all I've ever wanted to hear.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.020
Have you seen my neti pot?

01:08.650 --> 01:09.770
What?

01:11.860 --> 01:13.610
<i>Have you seen my neti pot?</i>

01:13.690 --> 01:16.570
Grace? Grace? Hello.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.740
Have you seen my neti pot?

01:18.830 --> 01:20.870
I don't know what that is.

01:20.950 --> 01:23.080
Neti pot. About yay high.

01:23.160 --> 01:24.410
Well, that does nothing.

01:24.500 --> 01:27.580
It's a Himalayan vessel,
shaped like an elephant head.

01:27.670 --> 01:32.090
I use it to flush mucus
out of my nasal cavities.

01:32.880 --> 01:34.210
It was on the kitchen sink.

01:34.300 --> 01:36.220
Well, then hopefully I threw it away.

01:36.300 --> 01:39.010
My anxieties go straight to my nose.

01:39.090 --> 01:41.510
I need a flush
before everyone gets here.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.020
It's your family, Frankie.
What's the problem?

01:44.100 --> 01:47.100
Coyote's got news.
When has that ever turned out well?

01:47.190 --> 01:49.150
Well, on the bright side,
if it's bad news,

01:49.230 --> 01:52.780
it'll take the sting
out of the lube disaster.

01:55.650 --> 01:57.660
It wasn't a great week.

02:05.290 --> 02:06.870
How's that book, Grace?

02:06.960 --> 02:09.169
Oh, it's very good. Very good.

02:09.250 --> 02:12.090
You can't fool me.
You're on the Isle of Phil.

02:12.170 --> 02:14.010
Yes.

02:14.090 --> 02:17.090
Fine. Yes.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.220
I am thinking about him,
but also Elaine.

02:21.350 --> 02:22.470
What are you gonna do?

02:22.560 --> 02:25.560
At the end of the day, he's still married.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.180
Right. So, it's a non-starter.

02:27.270 --> 02:29.850
Well, it's not fair to her.
You know, she's a person.

02:29.940 --> 02:33.820
-And she's his wife. No, not fair.
-He takes such good care of her.

02:33.900 --> 02:35.940
Super guy. Phil's the best.

02:36.030 --> 02:38.110
Would you stop agreeing with me
and help me?

02:38.200 --> 02:42.240
Well, stop making such excellent points!

02:42.320 --> 02:44.240
God, this is torture.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.790
Oh...

02:47.370 --> 02:49.210
Tell me what you really think.

02:50.370 --> 02:54.460
OK. Here's what I think:

02:54.550 --> 02:58.800
You get married, the vows say,

02:58.880 --> 03:02.300
"In sickness and in health."

03:13.440 --> 03:16.360
Change is all around us.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.530
The ducks are molting.

03:19.610 --> 03:21.740
I got my license back and...

03:21.820 --> 03:24.780
you got your license back.
What a year, huh?

03:24.870 --> 03:29.460
We're all in different living situations
and... Dad, how's your new place?

03:29.540 --> 03:32.500
It's nice. It's fine.

03:32.580 --> 03:36.420
A little somber.
I try not to be there, I get depressed.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.590
For the love of God, just tell us!

03:38.670 --> 03:40.760
Do you have a gambling debt?

03:40.840 --> 03:44.300
-Is someone gonna break your feet?
-No, no, no. It's nothing like that.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.810
No one's gay. No one's on drugs.

03:49.850 --> 03:51.520
I contacted my birth mother.

03:55.820 --> 03:57.150
Wow.

03:57.940 --> 03:59.490
That is big news.

03:59.570 --> 04:02.610
Everyone breathe. Let's all breathe.

04:06.660 --> 04:07.910
You OK?

04:08.660 --> 04:10.160
You need Dad to press on your sternum?

04:10.250 --> 04:12.250
-I'm not allowed to do that anymore.
-Not allowed.

04:12.330 --> 04:14.500
Coyote, that is great.

04:14.580 --> 04:17.170
I always knew this day would come
and I'm glad it's here.

04:17.250 --> 04:20.010
-Really?
-Yes.

04:20.089 --> 04:22.510
I mean, how did it go? What did she say?

04:22.590 --> 04:23.930
It was good.

04:24.010 --> 04:29.020
She lives in Baton Rouge,
her husband is a doctor.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.680
She sounded cool.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.730
She was happy to hear from me and...

04:35.900 --> 04:37.230
she wants to meet me.

04:37.310 --> 04:40.610
OK. OK.

04:40.690 --> 04:45.240
We can process this as a family.
We'll take some time,

04:45.320 --> 04:48.580
maybe a few weeks or months.

04:48.660 --> 04:51.080
We'll have a therapist come in.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.120
She's actually flying in tomorrow.

04:53.210 --> 04:57.580
OK. We can accelerate our process.
We are flexible people.

04:57.670 --> 04:59.130
But it's just for the day.

04:59.210 --> 05:00.920
This is great, Coyote.

05:01.010 --> 05:04.470
If you want, after you've
spent some time with her...

05:05.720 --> 05:08.600
bring her over here.
I would love to meet her.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.020
Wow.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.560
Thank you, Mom.

05:15.310 --> 05:17.690
You must be a cauldron of emotions.

05:17.770 --> 05:20.020
You want to walk us through
the first five?

05:20.110 --> 05:23.780
-I'm fine, honey.
-Dad, how do you feel?

05:23.860 --> 05:26.910
Well, let me check in.

05:29.990 --> 05:32.250
Nope, never mind, that was scary.

05:32.790 --> 05:35.460
Not about you. I'm OK.

05:35.540 --> 05:37.620
And I want to meet her, too.

05:37.710 --> 05:39.540
Oh, my God.

05:41.250 --> 05:45.090
Thank you.
Thank you. Oh, Mom.

05:45.170 --> 05:49.640
Oh, this is the best thing for you.
I'm so excited.

05:51.060 --> 05:54.060
What if he's building up
unreal expectations about her?

05:54.140 --> 05:56.810
What if he's imagining a natural blonde,

05:56.890 --> 06:00.560
soprano, tiny little feet,
who hums to birds?

06:00.650 --> 06:04.690
I'm pretty sure he knows his
birth mother is not a cartoon princess.

06:04.780 --> 06:06.700
Oh, who knows who's gonna
walk through that door?

06:06.780 --> 06:10.740
What if she's a stripper?
Or a climate denier?

06:11.990 --> 06:14.040
She could have-- She could have pica.

06:14.120 --> 06:17.660
Like that woman in Britain
who eats only old tires.

06:17.750 --> 06:20.130
This from a woman
who uses shampoo on the floor.

06:20.210 --> 06:22.170
It smells better. I checked online.

06:22.250 --> 06:25.550
What are you really worrying about?
Aside from the floor having dandruff?

06:25.630 --> 06:27.840
This could trigger Coyote.

06:27.930 --> 06:29.010
Here. Stop.

06:30.220 --> 06:32.550
Look, give him a little credit.

06:32.640 --> 06:36.060
You know, he's doing well.
And give yourself a little credit.

06:36.140 --> 06:39.480
You've raised
a moderately successful young man.

06:39.560 --> 06:42.770
Well, successful is the wrong word.
Uh, sweet.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.150
You're right.

06:44.230 --> 06:46.440
-I need to have a little faith.
-Yeah.

06:46.530 --> 06:49.700
I'm gonna pray to the Nordic god, Frigg.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.200
Frigg.

06:51.280 --> 06:54.450
Yeah, she-she rules
motherhood and wisdom.

06:54.530 --> 06:58.750
I would never pray to a female god,
especially one named Frigg.

06:58.830 --> 07:00.540
Well, she works for me.

07:00.620 --> 07:04.500
If you want to use your misogynistic God
with his fire and bullshit, go ahead.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.880
Well, we've had a falling out.

07:07.970 --> 07:09.800
All right.

07:09.880 --> 07:12.640
If you want me to hook you up
with Frigg, let me know.

07:12.720 --> 07:17.180
She's a god but you'd never know it.
Zero pretense.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.270
Wait a minute, what about the floor?

07:19.350 --> 07:21.310
Oh, it's OK. I feel better.

07:23.480 --> 07:27.110
Can't we just walk around the block?
Why do we need to go to a dog park?

07:27.190 --> 07:31.910
Because Tina needs to be socialized
and so do you. Come on, let's go.

07:31.990 --> 07:35.160
-This place is like a mausoleum.
-A mausoleum sounds tranquil.

07:35.240 --> 07:38.080
Oh, Robert,
I'd love to feel sorry for you,

07:38.160 --> 07:41.960
but that job's been taken by you.
Now, snap out of it.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.460
There's a whole world out there.

07:44.540 --> 07:46.550
And the doctor said
you need more exercise.

07:46.630 --> 07:48.050
How do you know what my doctor said?

07:48.130 --> 07:51.470
Is there a doctor
that suggests less exercise?

07:51.550 --> 07:54.470
Wait. Mmm.
You're not going like that.

07:54.550 --> 07:56.760
What? Is there a dress code
at the dog park?

07:56.850 --> 08:00.350
People make an effort.
And tucking is over.

08:00.430 --> 08:03.650
You can half-tuck, as of 2010.

08:03.730 --> 08:05.770
Why don't I full-tuck
and just stay home?

08:05.860 --> 08:08.650
Fine. Come on. Let's go.

08:08.730 --> 08:10.530
Do we take the car or ride the dog?

08:10.610 --> 08:14.490
Tina is not laughing. She is
very self-conscious about her size.

08:15.820 --> 08:18.120
- The bagels are toasted.
- Bagels are toasted.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.000
Is there a reason
we don't have knives out?

08:20.580 --> 08:22.540
-Yes.
-Ah.

08:23.420 --> 08:27.840
Is this appropriate food
for a birth mother brunch?

08:27.920 --> 08:30.380
I don't know. It's my first.

08:32.299 --> 08:37.799
You know, Bud, if you ever wanted to...
we would host a brunch for you, too.

08:40.429 --> 08:41.929
Thanks, Dad.

08:45.190 --> 08:47.900
-Do you want me to stay?
-No, I'm fine.

08:47.980 --> 08:50.820
This is not about me, Grace.
This is about Coyote.

08:50.900 --> 08:53.070
Well, the good news is
you found your neti pot.

08:53.150 --> 08:55.990
-Where?
-You're serving nuts in it.

08:57.320 --> 08:58.950
-Oy.
-You OK?

08:59.030 --> 09:01.870
You know, I can stay, you know.
This is a big deal for you.

09:01.950 --> 09:04.750
No, no.
The Bergsteins can handle anything.

09:04.830 --> 09:08.540
Yeah, if there's a shaman
and a team of astrologists on call.

09:08.630 --> 09:13.170
Oh, Shaman Earl said that I was
gonna feel something powerful,

09:13.260 --> 09:15.470
and a week later I saw <i> The Notebook,</i>

09:15.550 --> 09:18.010
so you can put that in your pipe
and smoke it.

09:18.760 --> 09:21.220
I think I'll stay until she gets here,
at least.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.560
Why? What are you avoiding?

09:23.640 --> 09:24.680
Nothing.

09:25.940 --> 09:26.770
Phil.

09:28.110 --> 09:30.190
I took to heart what you said yesterday.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.440
I can't keep seeing him.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.650
I'm so sorry.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.660
But at least you know
you're doing the right thing.

09:36.740 --> 09:40.620
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Always doing
the right thing. Little Miss Perfect.

09:40.700 --> 09:43.410
Never got a B,
never forgot a Thank You note.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.000
Fuck me.

09:45.080 --> 09:47.670
Are you sure you wouldn't rather
just call him?

09:47.750 --> 09:49.630
It would be the easier way.

09:49.710 --> 09:53.760
No, if I'm gonna do the decent thing,
I have to do it a decent way. In person.

09:53.840 --> 09:56.180
- They're here!
- Oh!

09:56.260 --> 09:57.800
You're gonna be fine.

09:57.880 --> 10:01.640
Of course I will. I've got the goddess
of love and openness on my side.

10:01.720 --> 10:04.220
Yeah, well if you need
the goddess of numbness and Xanax,

10:04.310 --> 10:06.390
I have some in my purse.

10:07.060 --> 10:10.480
Hey, everybody. This is Krystle.

10:10.560 --> 10:14.780
Oh, my Lord,
you are exactly how I imagined you.

10:14.860 --> 10:15.860
-Well, I'm not--
-That's not--

10:15.940 --> 10:18.990
Oh, my goodness, you're so beautiful.

10:19.070 --> 10:23.410
-Well, thank you.
-I'm back here. I'm Frankie.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.040
-Hi, there.
-Oh.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.790
I'm Grace. This is Coyote's mother.

10:26.870 --> 10:31.130
Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry.
Of course you are.

10:31.210 --> 10:34.380
- So nice to meet you. Oh!
- Oh!

10:34.460 --> 10:37.130
-Oh, ooh!
-Oh, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

10:37.220 --> 10:38.180
That was your toe.

10:38.260 --> 10:40.800
-Toes. And they're all fine.
-Are you sure?

10:40.890 --> 10:43.260
-Uh-huh. They're perfect.
-Hi, there.

10:43.350 --> 10:44.720
Nice to meet you.

10:44.810 --> 10:49.940
Now I don't know much,
but I know you must be Sol and Bud.

10:50.020 --> 10:52.690
You got that right. Some people don't.

10:52.770 --> 10:55.530
I'm gonna slip out.
Leave it to family.

10:55.610 --> 10:58.070
-It was very nice to meet you.
-Oh, you too.

10:58.150 --> 10:59.950
-Come sit.
-Here, here.

11:00.030 --> 11:01.240
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.660
-Oh, my gosh!
-Yeah, it's pretty, isn't it?

11:03.740 --> 11:05.120
-Is that the ocean?
-Yeah.

11:05.990 --> 11:08.120
She's great. Coyote's gonna be fine.

11:08.210 --> 11:12.670
Yeah, yeah, yeah! All good.
You're gonna be fine too.

11:12.750 --> 11:13.960
You're gonna be great.

11:14.040 --> 11:17.170
Yes. I hope. I don't know.

11:17.260 --> 11:21.340
Hey, call me if you need anything.
Just watch her feet.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.600
Yeah.

11:23.680 --> 11:28.350
Oh, because you're so kind to have me,
just a little something.

11:28.430 --> 11:33.810
Oh, thank you. Oh, my goodness.

11:34.520 --> 11:36.730
- Oh, that's...
- Huh.

11:36.820 --> 11:40.650
-I don't have one of these.
-Oh, good.

11:40.740 --> 11:41.740
You never know.

11:41.820 --> 11:46.490
Isn't that a sporty Jesus. Look,
you'd think his robe would trip him up.

11:46.580 --> 11:49.700
-Well, he is Jesus.
-We're gonna be fighting over this one.

11:50.830 --> 11:52.750
Thank you, Krystle.
That was very thoughtful.

11:52.830 --> 11:56.840
Well, I know it's a little kitschy
but even God needs a laugh.

11:56.920 --> 11:58.130
Uh-huh.

11:58.210 --> 12:00.010
So what kind of Christians are y'all?

12:01.680 --> 12:03.140
The Jewish kind.

12:03.220 --> 12:05.510
Oh, the originals.

12:12.770 --> 12:15.400
Not many women around here.

12:15.480 --> 12:16.860
There's one.

12:18.780 --> 12:19.780
Is that a woman?

12:19.860 --> 12:24.360
Well, her girlfriend is. It's Hillcrest.
This area is very eclectic.

12:24.450 --> 12:26.490
I know that. I don't live in a bag.

12:28.240 --> 12:30.330
-Hi.
-Hi.

12:31.580 --> 12:36.080
OK, so he just signaled
he wants to have sex with me.

12:36.170 --> 12:38.630
What? How did you get that?

12:38.710 --> 12:43.760
Because "hi" met with "hi"
sometimes means, "Well, hello."

12:46.760 --> 12:48.760
No, thank you, I'm not interested.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.270
He didn't say "hi" to you.

12:54.270 --> 12:55.770
Oh, jeez.

12:57.650 --> 13:01.990
Gary. Gary... you look guilty.

13:02.070 --> 13:03.150
Tell me everything.

13:03.990 --> 13:05.160
Be right back.

13:05.950 --> 13:07.910
Well, not right back, but soon.

13:07.990 --> 13:11.410
-Tina.
-Tina. It's OK.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.290
It's all right. There you go.

13:20.750 --> 13:25.010
It brings me so much joy
to see all the love here.

13:25.090 --> 13:28.010
Oh, there is. There really is.

13:28.090 --> 13:32.680
Eh, Coyote is one of the two best gifts
I've ever gotten in my life.

13:32.770 --> 13:36.020
-I'm the other gift.
-Well, I am so relieved

13:36.100 --> 13:39.270
that you have such a beautiful family.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.360
How long have y'all been married?

13:42.740 --> 13:44.360
We, uh...

13:44.440 --> 13:46.700
We've been married, uh,

13:46.780 --> 13:48.700
the whole time with Coyote.

13:48.780 --> 13:51.830
-That part was married.
-Uh, the Bud part, too.

13:51.910 --> 13:52.990
- Yep.
- Ah, yes.

13:53.080 --> 13:57.080
And now I'm, as it turns out,
a homosexual.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.540
And I'm married to another homosexual.

14:00.630 --> 14:02.760
A good Christian homosexual.

14:02.840 --> 14:06.760
Well, Catholic.
Unfortunately, we're separated right now,

14:06.840 --> 14:08.180
mostly because I sinned.

14:10.300 --> 14:12.390
Heterosexually.

14:14.430 --> 14:16.940
Uh-huh. I see.

14:17.020 --> 14:18.810
Lemonade! Who wants more?

14:18.900 --> 14:21.400
-I'm OK. No.
-Nobody? OK.

14:21.480 --> 14:22.320
Pita?

14:22.400 --> 14:23.400
-No, thank you.
-Pita?

14:23.480 --> 14:24.900
I'm fine, thanks.

14:24.980 --> 14:26.740
-Pita?
-No.

14:26.820 --> 14:30.030
So that woman who left here

14:30.120 --> 14:33.030
was your, um...

14:34.330 --> 14:37.620
Um, girl-- Partner?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.870
No, no, no. We're just roommates.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.960
-OK.
-I mean, it's not like

14:42.040 --> 14:44.460
a Gertrude Stein,
Alice B. Cooper situation.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.340
-Toklas.
-Right.

14:46.420 --> 14:49.590
But I did start dating
a yam farmer.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.550
-You have?
-You did?

14:50.640 --> 14:53.760
You did? The cute one?

14:53.850 --> 14:55.930
We'll talk about it later.

15:14.580 --> 15:18.120
Well, it's not my world,
so I shouldn't give advice,

15:18.200 --> 15:20.120
but if it's what you want,

15:20.210 --> 15:23.960
then I hope Robert's the kind
of Christian who can forgive you.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.710
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

15:28.470 --> 15:29.630
Jesus.

15:33.140 --> 15:36.310
Frankie, honey,
is there anything I can help you with?

15:37.180 --> 15:40.600
Um... I'm beyond help.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.980
I mean, I'm OK.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.480
Honey.

15:48.570 --> 15:51.240
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, girl.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.910
Hey.

15:56.910 --> 15:58.910
It's amazing, isn't it?

16:00.330 --> 16:03.830
-They're so uninhibited.
-I suppose it's generational.

16:05.170 --> 16:08.300
I might be similarly inclined
if I were 25, but...

16:08.960 --> 16:10.630
I came out at 55.

16:10.720 --> 16:16.350
-I got you beat. I came out at 70.
-Well, better late than never.

16:17.140 --> 16:19.970
-I'm John.
-Robert.

16:21.020 --> 16:23.270
Oh, and, uh, Augie.

16:23.350 --> 16:26.860
This is Tina. I think. She's not mine.

16:26.940 --> 16:28.730
-Can we join you?
-Oh, please.

16:28.820 --> 16:30.990
Here we go, girl. Come on. Sit.

16:31.070 --> 16:32.360
Good girl.

16:33.110 --> 16:36.490
What made you step out of the closet
after all these years, Robert?

16:36.580 --> 16:38.030
I fell in love.

16:38.120 --> 16:41.330
Now, that's a great reason.
Good for you.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.630
Maybe we're the lucky ones.

16:48.710 --> 16:50.000
How's that?

16:51.050 --> 16:52.760
When you come out young these days,

16:52.840 --> 16:56.890
it's difficult to avoid
the near occasion of sin.

16:56.970 --> 16:59.310
-Amen.
-A fellow papist.

16:59.390 --> 17:01.520
And an old-school one at that.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.810
I still cherish my copy
of the <i> Baltimore Catechism.</i>

17:04.900 --> 17:06.770
There's nothing wrong
with a little self-flagellation.

17:09.480 --> 17:11.230
We've come a long way, though.

17:12.190 --> 17:14.109
Tell me about it. I used to be a priest.

17:16.819 --> 17:18.950
-You were not.
-Was too.

17:19.030 --> 17:21.160
Diocesan priest, 34 years.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.200
Really?

17:23.579 --> 17:27.630
Were you laicized
or did you just quietly sneak away?

17:27.710 --> 17:29.920
I was laicized.

17:31.460 --> 17:32.920
Good.

17:34.170 --> 17:36.470
-You've given me hope, though.
-How's that?

17:36.550 --> 17:39.640
Falling in love at 70 is miraculous.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.220
Well, we fell in love at 50.

17:42.310 --> 17:46.850
Then we decided to divorce our wives
and get married at 70.

17:46.940 --> 17:48.810
Congratulations.

17:48.900 --> 17:51.650
Thank you, but we're no longer together.

17:51.730 --> 17:55.190
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-I am too.

17:58.360 --> 18:02.410
I-I assume you remember me.
I-I know it's been a while.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.460
In any case, I'm here now

18:07.540 --> 18:10.630
and I probably owe you an apology.

18:11.630 --> 18:14.260
I got a little blamey. I'm sorry.

18:15.420 --> 18:17.380
I'd venture to say
everybody blames you

18:17.470 --> 18:19.180
when they're going through a divorce.

18:19.260 --> 18:22.430
But you can take it. You're you.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.350
So, um... Hmm.

18:29.690 --> 18:32.440
If you still love me,

18:32.520 --> 18:35.610
which I imagine you must, you know,

18:35.690 --> 18:38.530
despite my drinking and some
of the more colorful language I use...

18:40.870 --> 18:43.870
I'd appreciate some strength today.

18:44.950 --> 18:47.870
I'm about to do something very hard.

18:50.250 --> 18:54.250
You're all-knowing,
so I'm probably stating the obvious.

18:55.250 --> 19:00.430
I need your help. Otherwise,
I don't think I can just walk away.

19:00.510 --> 19:03.930
Please, please be with me.

19:04.010 --> 19:07.850
I really-- I really need you today.

19:13.230 --> 19:14.770
Amen.

19:17.530 --> 19:19.610
Thank you for your time.

19:29.790 --> 19:31.330
Thanks again.

19:34.290 --> 19:35.960
Nwa-bu-di-ke.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.170
Now you got it.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.590
How did you come up
with such interesting names

19:39.670 --> 19:42.510
like Nwabudike and Coyote?

19:42.590 --> 19:45.100
We have a pretty interesting
family here, Krystle.

19:45.180 --> 19:46.890
It's not like we were gonna

19:46.970 --> 19:49.430
name our kids: Mike, Bob and Steve.

19:51.060 --> 19:54.650
Uh, Mom, um, Steve
is one of Krystle's boys.

19:55.480 --> 19:59.650
And what a great name it is.
I mean, I wish we'd thought of it,

19:59.740 --> 20:01.280
but we're way too weird.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.490
I'm sorry. I-I hope I didn't offend you.

20:05.580 --> 20:09.790
You didn't. I'm sorry that I'm
making such a pig of myself.

20:09.870 --> 20:12.830
Thank you for this wonderful meal.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.540
It's really our pleasure. Your sweet
nature is so much like Coyote's.

20:18.630 --> 20:24.300
And so is the way you pull on your ear
when you're listening. It's eerie.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.640
My youngest does that, too.

20:26.720 --> 20:29.640
Really? That's wild.

20:34.520 --> 20:36.650
-The quiche is great, Mom.
-Oh, thanks honey,

20:36.730 --> 20:41.030
-but it's bland as shit.
-Oh, no, I think it's delicious.

20:41.110 --> 20:42.570
- Hmm.
- Uh, Mom,

20:42.650 --> 20:44.450
could you pass the Tabasco, please?

20:44.530 --> 20:46.660
Sure. Coming in hot.

20:46.740 --> 20:48.370
-Oh!
-Oh, my God!

20:48.450 --> 20:50.620
Oh, I'm sorry!

20:50.700 --> 20:52.620
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
-Ow, ow, ow, ow!

20:52.710 --> 20:55.880
-Is that blood or Tabasco?
-Get a towel and some ice!

20:55.960 --> 20:58.920
Ow, ow. No, no, it's OK.
It's just a little bit of blood.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.210
-No, no, it's fine.
-What the hell, Mom?

21:01.300 --> 21:04.220
-It was an accident.
-You threw it at her.

21:04.300 --> 21:07.260
I said "coming in hot"!
Where are her reflexes?

21:07.350 --> 21:10.890
Are you kidding me?
So this is her fault?

21:15.190 --> 21:18.900
-You broke Jesus?
-He'll come back, that's his thing.

21:18.980 --> 21:21.730
OK, what is happening?
You invited her here.

21:21.820 --> 21:23.440
You said you were cool with this.

21:23.530 --> 21:25.200
-I am cool.
-Really?

21:25.280 --> 21:27.450
Because first you stepped on her foot,

21:27.530 --> 21:29.200
and then you threw Tabasco
at her face,

21:29.280 --> 21:31.080
and now you killed Jesus.

21:31.160 --> 21:32.540
Jesus was an accident.

21:32.620 --> 21:35.120
But the other stuff wasn't?

21:35.210 --> 21:37.500
I didn't say that.

21:39.960 --> 21:40.960
Oh, God.

21:47.590 --> 21:48.640
Hey.

21:48.720 --> 21:50.100
Hey.

21:50.970 --> 21:52.770
I like this place.

21:53.730 --> 21:56.940
If you run away, I don't have to
hang back and pay the check.

21:57.020 --> 21:59.860
Sorry.

21:59.940 --> 22:03.150
Always leaving you somewhere,
aren't I?

22:04.400 --> 22:06.070
How about today?

22:14.370 --> 22:15.660
Today, too.

22:18.120 --> 22:19.630
I'm sorry.

22:21.380 --> 22:24.630
I just can't do it.
I can't do it to Elaine.

22:25.550 --> 22:27.380
Oh, Grace.

22:37.310 --> 22:41.900
You know... when I went back
to Robert after you...

22:43.150 --> 22:45.480
I just shut down.

22:48.820 --> 22:52.160
After he left,
I tried dating someone, but...

22:56.160 --> 22:57.540
he wasn't you.

23:01.540 --> 23:03.750
God, I wish things were different.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.340
You have no idea.

23:06.420 --> 23:08.420
Oh, yes, I do.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.640
You're sure?

23:12.720 --> 23:14.970
No, no.

23:17.560 --> 23:20.650
But that doesn't change anything.

23:25.900 --> 23:29.860
-Our timing really sucks, doesn't it?
-It does.

23:29.950 --> 23:32.160
-It does.
-Always has.

23:34.530 --> 23:37.410
-Nice to meet you.
-Oh, you too, honey.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.960
And good luck with Robert.

23:40.040 --> 23:42.330
-Nwabudike.
-Said like a pro.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.130
- Oh.
- Bye.

23:44.210 --> 23:45.380
Bye-bye.

23:45.460 --> 23:49.670
-Once again, I am so mortified.
-Oh, honey, it's fine.

23:49.760 --> 23:53.640
This isn't the first nose I've had,
and it probably won't be the last.

23:53.720 --> 23:56.720
I'm just sorry I bled
all over your chair.

23:56.810 --> 23:59.600
Oh, don't worry, it's Grace's.

23:59.680 --> 24:01.270
Oh.

24:01.350 --> 24:03.190
Oh.

24:04.230 --> 24:07.440
My driver's getting impatient.

24:10.860 --> 24:12.990
Oh. Oh.

24:13.070 --> 24:16.700
I can't believe I met you.
It's been incredible.

24:16.780 --> 24:18.540
Thank you so much for coming.

24:18.620 --> 24:21.410
It's such a joy
to see how well you turned out.

24:21.500 --> 24:25.000
I can't wait to meet your boys.
And Paul Senior.

24:25.080 --> 24:28.130
We should figure out some dates
when I can come to Baton Rouge.

24:28.210 --> 24:30.670
Oh. Oh, honey...

24:32.380 --> 24:35.180
I never told my family about you.

24:36.470 --> 24:37.680
Oh.

24:39.310 --> 24:41.060
Well, OK, but...

24:41.140 --> 24:44.270
I can't. I can't. I never told them.

24:44.350 --> 24:46.560
You don't understand where I came from.

24:46.650 --> 24:49.070
And they don't know where I came from.

24:50.070 --> 24:54.570
And Coyote was the result of...
that time in my life.

24:54.660 --> 24:57.330
Wait a minute.
Where does your family think you are?

24:57.410 --> 25:00.330
In New York. Seeing <i> Kinky Boots.</i>

25:00.410 --> 25:05.880
So we can welcome you into our family,
but you can't welcome him into yours?

25:06.880 --> 25:07.960
Why did you come?

25:08.040 --> 25:10.800
I've felt so guilty since I gave him away,

25:10.880 --> 25:12.920
and I wanted to make sure
my son was fine.

25:13.010 --> 25:16.840
And he is. I figured I owed it to you.

25:16.930 --> 25:20.470
Oh, wait a minute.
I have to call bullshit here, Krystle.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.100
No. Hey, Mom, it's OK.

25:22.180 --> 25:24.230
It is not OK, sweetheart.

25:24.310 --> 25:29.940
You should have told him before you came
that this was a one-way street.

25:34.610 --> 25:39.330
Take care, Coyote.
I wish you every happiness.

25:58.260 --> 26:00.600
I'm so sorry I put you through this.

26:00.680 --> 26:03.890
Oh, you didn't put me through anything.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.020
Are you OK?

26:07.900 --> 26:09.360
I'm all right.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.690
I have a great mom.

26:12.820 --> 26:14.280
H-How about you?

26:16.200 --> 26:17.990
My mom's dead.

26:23.830 --> 26:26.000
It was the ear thing.

26:26.080 --> 26:31.340
When I saw how she tugged her ear
exactly how you do, it just hit me.

26:31.420 --> 26:34.010
I couldn't deny it anymore.

26:35.170 --> 26:37.180
She's your mother.

26:38.220 --> 26:40.050
No, she's not.

26:41.640 --> 26:44.430
My mother's sitting right next to me.

26:54.070 --> 26:58.110
When has anyone in this family
ever said "coming in hot"?

26:58.200 --> 27:00.780
Never. Not once.

27:01.950 --> 27:05.740
You know, I'm not even sure
why I know that phrase.

27:07.410 --> 27:10.170
If you ever become someone else,

27:10.250 --> 27:14.840
maybe somebody that makes morally
questionable decisions,

27:14.920 --> 27:16.800
give me a call.

27:16.880 --> 27:21.300
If I become that girl,
you'll be my first call.

27:24.600 --> 27:27.310
-OK.
-OK.

27:32.310 --> 27:36.440
- I'm over here.
- I am, too.

27:36.530 --> 27:39.990
Well, that really blows
my sad, dramatic goodbye.

27:40.070 --> 27:43.370
It's still sad, don't worry.

27:52.080 --> 27:54.460
Oh, are you fucking kidding me?

27:58.420 --> 27:59.420
Can I help you?

28:02.760 --> 28:05.600
I started going--
I would go with her to mass occasionally.

28:05.680 --> 28:08.390
Ah...

28:18.070 --> 28:21.780
Bud, I can't talk right now.
I'm stalking Robert.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.240
Battery is brand new.

28:30.540 --> 28:33.290
-Are the keys in it?
-Yes.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.930
Ah.

28:48.510 --> 28:51.310
I find that it starts better
when it's in park.

28:51.390 --> 28:54.230
Well, that's not embarrassing.

28:58.270 --> 28:59.900
OK then.

29:01.820 --> 29:04.110
I'm sorry I kept you.

29:04.950 --> 29:07.950
It's OK. I'm staying in town.

29:09.290 --> 29:11.700
OK. So, um...

29:13.620 --> 29:14.750
goodbye.

29:17.460 --> 29:20.210
Unless we, uh, take the same route home

29:20.300 --> 29:23.170
and end up next to each other
by a stoplight.

29:27.720 --> 29:29.560
So this is it then.

29:31.560 --> 29:32.890
Yes.

29:38.400 --> 29:41.440
No. No.

29:43.900 --> 29:45.110
No.
