30:34.049 --> 30:35.007
We're federal agents.

30:35.050 --> 30:36.051
Investigator Martin Deeks,

30:36.095 --> 30:37.705
this is Special Agent Kensi Blye

30:37.748 --> 30:39.054

to ask you a few questions.

30:43.624 --> 30:45.147
Bye, guys.

30:45.191 --> 30:46.366
Henrik,

30:46.409 --> 30:48.672
this is a breach of my trust.

30:48.716 --> 30:50.022
You'll never do another
real estate deal for me.

30:50.065 --> 30:52.763
I-I'm sorry, I...

30:52.807 --> 30:54.374
I understand, sir.

30:54.417 --> 30:56.811
Okay. Go with the guys.

30:56.855 --> 30:57.943
We've got Sugarfish
in the truck.

30:57.986 --> 30:59.683
Help yourself.

30:59.727 --> 31:00.989
Thank you.

31:03.209 --> 31:07.300
Do you know a woman
named Ryan Logue?

31:07.343 --> 31:09.171
Why am I supposed to be
answering your questions?

31:09.215 --> 31:10.825
Because we're asking nicely.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.218
DEEKS: And the fact that
you have three houses

31:12.261 --> 31:14.263
in escrow across Los Angeles,
and if you don't want

31:14.307 --> 31:16.439
to answer the questions,
that's fine, gives us

31:16.483 --> 31:17.484
all sorts of extra time
to investigate where you got

31:17.527 --> 31:19.051
the money
for those down payments.

31:19.094 --> 31:20.966
So don't answer
questions, just send us

31:21.009 --> 31:22.881

for the past three years.

31:22.924 --> 31:24.230

31:25.535 --> 31:27.711

31:27.755 --> 31:29.365
Ah. We're funny.
Thanks.

31:29.409 --> 31:32.281
I know that name, Ryan Logue,
but I don't know her.

31:32.325 --> 31:34.109
That's interesting, 'cause
she said that you threatened

31:34.153 --> 31:35.110
to kill her father
if she didn't steal

31:35.154 --> 31:38.070
top secret military files
for you.

31:38.113 --> 31:40.507

Is that what she said?

31:40.550 --> 31:41.856
[Ukrainian accent]:
That is what she said.

31:42.857 --> 31:44.903
Logue contacted my people,

31:44.946 --> 31:46.513
wanted to sell us

31:46.556 --> 31:48.515
some U.S. military
engineering schematics.

31:48.558 --> 31:50.473
How much did she want for it?Never got that far.

31:52.301 --> 31:55.261
My people shut her down,
told her we weren't interested

31:55.304 --> 31:56.479
in doing business with people
we don't know.

31:56.523 --> 31:57.654
[regular accent]:
You weren't interested

31:57.698 --> 31:58.873
in what she was selling?

31:58.917 --> 32:01.136
My people are well-trained.

32:01.180 --> 32:02.921
They didn't let her say
what she was selling.

32:02.964 --> 32:06.228
Hmm. So, engineer with
a top secret clearance

32:06.272 --> 32:08.056
says one thing,

32:08.100 --> 32:10.276
Eastern European criminal
says another, so why...

32:10.319 --> 32:12.017
"Eastern European criminal"?

32:12.060 --> 32:13.757
Ouch.

32:13.801 --> 32:15.498
I am a legitimate arms dealer.

32:15.542 --> 32:16.978
Well, that's debatable.

32:17.022 --> 32:18.371
DEEKS:So, why should
we trust you

32:18.414 --> 32:19.676
over Logue?

32:21.156 --> 32:22.505
You got good computer people
that work for you?

32:22.549 --> 32:23.898
Yes.
The best.

32:25.552 --> 32:29.338
Have your people hack into
this site on the dark web.

32:29.382 --> 32:31.210
You will find that Logue
is the one trying

32:31.253 --> 32:33.342
to drum up a buyer
for what she's selling.

32:33.386 --> 32:34.953
Thank you.

32:35.997 --> 32:37.520
You have a card, Agent Blye?

32:37.564 --> 32:38.782
I'm sorry?

32:38.826 --> 32:40.393
You know, in case I...

32:40.436 --> 32:42.264
think of anything else?

32:42.308 --> 32:44.266
DEEKS:That's okay, you
can just call me.

32:44.310 --> 32:45.354
Just call him.

So what can, uh,

Okay, Big Vander, well...

33:19.432 --> 33:21.173
I've been hearing rumors
on the street.

33:21.216 --> 33:24.002
There's a notebook
floating around.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.830
All right?

33:26.874 --> 33:29.746
This notebook has
the names of a bunch

33:29.790 --> 33:31.400
of dirty
federal agents.

33:32.880 --> 33:36.057
If you're part of that,
I want in.

33:37.798 --> 33:39.147
You feel me?

33:39.191 --> 33:40.801
It would be
really helpful

33:40.844 --> 33:42.237

in Mexico.

33:46.633 --> 33:48.417
Damn, Switch.

33:48.461 --> 33:50.550
What's up?

I trusted you, fam.

I only got a shot

34:06.870 --> 34:08.046
on one of the gunmen, Sam.

34:08.089 --> 34:09.830
Vander, what's going on, man?

34:09.873 --> 34:11.353
Switch, you screwed up, son.

34:11.397 --> 34:13.834
Sam, you need to get
out of there now.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.151
I don't have the shot, Sam.
You got to move.

Drop the gun.

34:51.045 --> 34:53.700
No shot. I repeat, no shot.

34:53.743 --> 34:55.484
You got to get Vander
to move outside.

34:55.528 --> 34:57.704
You need to put the gun down.

34:57.747 --> 35:00.315
You know me,
I can't go out like that.

35:02.187 --> 35:04.276
Only the cops know
I had that notebook.

35:04.319 --> 35:05.712
How you know about it,
then, Switch?

35:05.755 --> 35:07.670
LANCE:
Move him into view, Sam.

35:07.714 --> 35:08.889
Give me a clear shot.

35:08.932 --> 35:10.195
Vander,

35:10.238 --> 35:12.284
I can help you,

35:12.327 --> 35:14.155
but you need
to put that gun down.

35:15.156 --> 35:16.201
The cops want that notebook.

You're a cop, Switch,

How you gonna do me like that?

35:36.046 --> 35:38.310
Vander, we can deal with this.

35:38.353 --> 35:40.050
Okay?

35:40.094 --> 35:41.443
Just put the gun down.

35:44.968 --> 35:47.319
I can't do jail time.

Amantas was telling the truth.

36:33.016 --> 36:34.757
I unlocked the encrypted name

36:34.801 --> 36:36.150
and traced it back
to an I.P. address

36:36.194 --> 36:38.631
that Ryan Logue was using.

36:38.674 --> 36:41.024
Logue was trying to find
a buyer on the dark web

36:41.068 --> 36:43.375
for the schematics, but, uh,

36:43.418 --> 36:45.203
it doesn't look like she was
having much luck, though.

36:45.246 --> 36:46.726
This whole
"being a criminal" thing

36:46.769 --> 36:48.423
is harder than it looks.

36:48.467 --> 36:49.990
Well, she probably figured
she'd done the hard part

36:50.033 --> 36:51.600
by stealing the schematics
and getting away with it.

out of the blue.

That's got "law enforcement
operation" written all over it.

37:00.087 --> 37:01.567
Yeah. Fill in Kilbride,
and hopefully he can use

37:01.610 --> 37:03.438
all of this as leverage

37:03.482 --> 37:05.310
to get Logue to turn over
her copies of the schematics.

37:05.353 --> 37:07.442
Copy that.

37:10.706 --> 37:12.969
Were you able to get anyone
to check on my dad?
