00:35.000 --> 00:37.501
YES, THE BILLO
MIRACLE SAW HAS THE POWER

00:37.569 --> 00:39.203
TO CUT DOWN THIS TREE,

00:39.271 --> 00:40.421
AND YET IT'S PRECISE ENOUGH

00:40.456 --> 00:43.041
TO MAKE YOUR OWN HOMEMADE
JIGSAW PUZZLES.

00:44.693 --> 00:47.012
AND IF YOU CALL
WITHIN THE NEXT 10 MINUTES,

00:47.079 --> 00:50.698
WE'LL SEND YOU THIS PAIR
OF MIRACLE SAFETY GOGGLES FREE.

00:57.206 --> 00:58.172
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:58.240 --> 00:59.374
QUIET.

00:59.441 --> 01:02.110
THE MIRACLE SAFETY GOGGLE
CLOCK IS TICKIN'.

01:02.177 --> 01:05.013
DOUG, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO WITH A CHAIN SAW?

01:05.080 --> 01:07.766
WHAT AM I NOT GONNA DO?

01:07.833 --> 01:09.834
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU BUY THIS CHAIN SAW,

01:09.901 --> 01:13.037
I KNOW FOR A FACT I WILL BE
BRINGING YOUR THUMB TO THE HOSPITAL

01:13.105 --> 01:15.473
IN A ZIPLOC BAG.

01:15.541 --> 01:17.508
I'M ON HOLD. CRAP.

01:17.576 --> 01:19.510
I JUST SAW AN AD
FOR A MIRACLE CHAIN SAW.

01:19.578 --> 01:21.412
I NEED TO BORROW
SOME PLASTIC.

01:22.147 --> 01:23.531
ALREADY ORDERING ONE.

01:23.598 --> 01:24.532
MAKE IT 2.

01:24.599 --> 01:25.666
I THINK ONE'S ENOUGH.

01:25.734 --> 01:27.035
SURE, UNTIL WE BOTH NEED

01:27.102 --> 01:28.436
TO CHAIN SAW SOMETHING
AT THE SAME TIME.

01:28.503 --> 01:30.538
USE YOUR HEAD.

01:30.605 --> 01:31.973
ALL RIGHT. HOW ABOUT THIS
FOR A COMPROMISE?

01:32.041 --> 01:33.875
NOBODY GETS
A CHAIN SAW, EVER.

01:33.943 --> 01:35.410
BUT I'M TIRED OF
THROWING MY MONEY AWAY

01:35.477 --> 01:36.978
ON STORE-BOUGHT
JIGSAW PUZZLES.

01:37.046 --> 01:39.915
YEAH, AND BY THE WAY,
YOU CAN'T JUST TELL ME NO.

01:39.982 --> 01:41.249
UH, YES, I CAN.

01:41.316 --> 01:43.384
UH, NO, YOU CAN'T.

01:43.452 --> 01:46.821
UH, YEAH, I CAN.
WE MADE THAT DEAL, REMEMBER?

01:46.889 --> 01:48.173
WHAT, THAT YOU CAN
JUST SAY NO AND-

01:48.240 --> 01:49.774
AND HAVE CONTROL
OVER MY ENTIRE LIFE

01:49.842 --> 01:51.642
AND I GOT NO SAY
WHATSOEVER?

01:51.710 --> 01:52.810
YEAH.

01:52.878 --> 01:54.145
WHEN DID I
AGREE TO THAT?

01:54.212 --> 01:57.715
10 YEARS AGO
WHEN WE BOUGHT THIS HOUSE.

01:59.801 --> 02:01.603
OH, RIGHT.

02:03.606 --> 02:06.173
AND THIS IS
THE MASTER BEDROOM.

02:06.242 --> 02:07.609
HIS AND HER CLOSETS

02:07.676 --> 02:10.578
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH HIS MESS.

02:10.645 --> 02:13.281
HONEY, THIS IS
PERFECT FOR US.

02:13.349 --> 02:14.682

02:31.300 --> 02:32.233
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

02:32.301 --> 02:34.034
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN TV IN THE BEDROOM.

02:36.739 --> 02:38.206
REALLY, HONEY?

02:38.274 --> 02:40.174
NO. FROM THE MOMENT
WE WALK IN THAT DOOR,

02:40.243 --> 02:43.945
IT'S ABOUT YOU,
ME, AND SHARING.

02:44.012 --> 02:46.715

03:03.782 --> 03:06.817
OH. I LOVE

03:06.885 --> 03:08.386
OH, CRAP, HONEY.

03:12.058 --> 03:14.192
DINE-IN KITCHEN.

THE UPSTAIRS BEDROOM...

03:36.499 --> 03:38.566
AND THE NEIGHBORS,

03:38.634 --> 03:40.434
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THE NEIGHBORS?

03:40.502 --> 03:41.903
THEY'RE SKINHEADS.

03:43.989 --> 03:45.222
REALLY?

03:45.290 --> 03:48.026

03:48.094 --> 03:50.512

03:50.579 --> 03:52.330
SHE SEEMED
VERY SWEET.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.482
SHE TRIED TO SELL ME CRACK.
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYIN'.

04:04.043 --> 04:05.359
HEY, GREAT. WELL,

04:10.816 --> 04:12.383

04:12.451 --> 04:13.451
OH, IT'S
OUR REAL ESTATE AGENT.

04:13.518 --> 04:14.885
THERE'S ANOTHER HOUSE
SHE WANTS US TO SEE.

04:14.954 --> 04:16.220
OH, OK. WELL,

04:16.288 --> 04:17.822
I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA
TOP THE ONE WE ALREADY SAW-

04:17.889 --> 04:19.824
GREAT PRICE,
GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD.

04:19.891 --> 04:20.825
I KNOW,
AND THAT BASEMENT-

04:20.892 --> 04:22.393
IT'S PERFECT
FOR MY HOME GYM.

04:22.461 --> 04:24.595
I GOT MY FREE WEIGHTS ON ONE SIDE,

04:24.663 --> 04:27.265
ALL MY CARDIO
ON THE OTHER.

04:27.333 --> 04:28.333
WELL, DON'T
GET TOO RIPPED, OK?

04:28.400 --> 04:31.169
I LIKE A LITTLE SOMETHIN'
I CAN GRAB ONTO.

04:31.236 --> 04:33.071
I CAN'T MAKE
THAT PROMISE.

04:33.138 --> 04:34.105
MM-HMM.

04:39.078 --> 04:41.645
THAT IS THE TABLE
I EAT ON.

04:42.881 --> 04:44.849
HI, DAD.
HEY, ARTHUR.

04:44.916 --> 04:46.317
LOOK, WHEN I TOLD YOU KIDS
YOU COULD STAY WITH ME

04:46.385 --> 04:47.685
AFTER YOU GAVE UP
THE APARTMENT,

04:47.752 --> 04:48.686
I WAS GLAD TO HELP OUT.

04:48.753 --> 04:52.690
BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE,
IT'S BEEN 10 DAYS.

04:52.758 --> 04:55.427
YES, WE KNOW, AND WE
MAY HAVE FOUND A PLACE.

04:55.494 --> 04:57.696
GOOD. NOW HIT ME
WITH A MARTINI.

04:57.763 --> 04:58.697
YOU GOT IT.

04:58.764 --> 05:00.332
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

05:00.399 --> 05:03.167
LET'S JUST SAY BEING A
DECORATIVE RIBBON SALESMAN

05:03.235 --> 05:06.103
ISN'T AS GLAMOROUS
AS IT USED TO BE.

05:06.171 --> 05:08.289
WHY? YOU DIDN'T GET
THE WINEMAKER'S ACCOUNT?

05:08.356 --> 05:09.940
NOPE. THEY DECIDED
TO GO HIGH-TECH

05:10.008 --> 05:13.010
WITH ELASTIC BOX BANDS.

05:13.078 --> 05:14.379
OH. HERE YOU GO.

05:14.446 --> 05:17.415
THANKS.

05:17.483 --> 05:18.849
IF I COULD CLOSE
ONE BIG ACCOUNT,

05:18.917 --> 05:20.518
I'D BE ON EASY STREET.

05:20.585 --> 05:23.354
NO MORE TRIPS
TO HICK TOWNS UPSTATE.

05:23.422 --> 05:27.225
NO MORE EVENINGS LOCKED IN THE
FLESHY ARMS OF SOME SPINSTER

05:27.292 --> 05:31.695
JUST SO SHE'LL BUY 2 SPOOLS
FOR HER CARD SHOP.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.234
AHH.

05:37.302 --> 05:39.704
AND ONCE AGAIN, I'M ALIVE.

05:41.707 --> 05:44.275
HOW YOU DOIN'? WE'RE
HERE TO SEE THE HOUSE.

05:44.342 --> 05:45.877

THE HEFFERNANS?

05:45.944 --> 05:48.312
YES. I MEAN, UH...

05:48.380 --> 05:51.516

05:51.583 --> 05:54.585
I'M THE HEFFERNAN. MY WIFE-MY
WIFE'S MEETIN' US HERE.

05:54.653 --> 05:57.721

SELLING THE PLACE FURNISHED.

05:57.789 --> 06:00.758
TAKE A LOOK AROUND.
I'LL BE RIGHT IN.

06:04.730 --> 06:08.466
SWEET MAMA, I'M HOME.

06:08.534 --> 06:10.235
PRETTY COOL, MAN.
HEY, LOOK AT THIS.

06:10.302 --> 06:11.636
SUNKEN LIVING ROOM.

06:11.704 --> 06:16.708
OR YOU BRING IN A HOSE.
BOOM! INDOOR POOL!

06:16.775 --> 06:18.175
HOW GREAT
ARE THESE STAIRS?!

06:18.244 --> 06:19.344
HEY, CHECK IT OUT.
THERE'S AN INTERCOM.

06:19.411 --> 06:20.345
OH, REALLY?

06:20.412 --> 06:21.979
YEAH.
OH.

06:22.047 --> 06:25.015
UH, BREAKER,
BREAKER, CARRIE,

06:25.083 --> 06:27.818
BIG DADDY'S HOME. WHY

06:27.886 --> 06:30.688
NAKED?

06:30.756 --> 06:33.258
I'LL HAVE BETTER STUFF.
I LOVE THIS PLACE!

06:33.325 --> 06:35.727
SHH, SHH, SHH. HEY, YOU
DON'T WANT HIM TO KNOW

06:35.794 --> 06:36.761
HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE THE PLACE.

06:36.828 --> 06:37.828
HE MIGHT
JACK THE PRICE UP.

06:37.896 --> 06:39.096
RIGHT. I GOTCHA.
OK, GOOD.

06:39.164 --> 06:40.931
SO WHAT DO YOU
THINK?

06:40.999 --> 06:42.166
IT'S GOT
GREAT FLOW, HUH?

06:42.234 --> 06:43.768
UH-HUH. YEAH, YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:43.835 --> 06:47.254
SO DOES A TEA BAG, THOUGH,
AND I DON'T WANNA LIVE IN ONE.

06:47.322 --> 06:50.925
AND I GOTTA TELL YA, I'M NOT
REALLY LOVIN' THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

06:50.993 --> 06:53.578
ACTUALLY, THIS IS
A VERY DESIRABLE AREA.

06:53.646 --> 06:56.581
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET, THERE'S
AN EXCELLENT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

06:56.649 --> 06:57.916
GEE, I'M NOT SURE
WHAT YOU'RE IMPLYING,

06:57.983 --> 06:59.651
BUT I ALREADY BEEN
TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

07:03.605 --> 07:04.805
WHAT'S THIS RIGHT HERE?

07:04.874 --> 07:06.140
OH, THAT'S
THE DUMBWAITER.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.993
YOU CAN SEND FOOD
RIGHT UP TO THE BEDROOM.

07:15.901 --> 07:19.353
I DESPERATELY
WANT THIS HOUSE.

07:19.421 --> 07:20.371
WELL, GREAT.

07:20.438 --> 07:22.140
IS THERE ANY WAY WE CAN
CLOSE THE DEAL BY SATURDAY?

07:22.207 --> 07:23.707
'CAUSE I'D REALLY
LOVE TO BARBECUE.

07:23.775 --> 07:25.743
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, HONEY, HI.

07:25.811 --> 07:28.279
WHAT, ARE YOU
BUYIN' A HOUSE?

07:28.347 --> 07:30.231
<i>NOT A HOUSE, THE HOUSE!</i>

07:30.299 --> 07:32.533
CAN'T YOU JUST SEE US
GROWIN' OLD HERE, HUH?

07:34.069 --> 07:36.704
UM, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND OVER HERE?

07:36.772 --> 07:40.507
SURE YOU DON'T WANNA
JOIN ME IN THE LOVE GLOVE?

07:40.575 --> 07:43.677
NO. NO,
I DON'T THINK I DO.

07:43.746 --> 07:45.713
YOU KNOW WHAT? I-I THINK
I'M GONNA ROLL.

07:45.781 --> 07:47.048
I'LL SEE YOU LATER,
BRAINIAC.

07:52.954 --> 07:55.105
UM...

07:55.173 --> 07:57.391
DO YOU MIND? COULD WE
HAVE A MINUTE, PLEASE?

07:57.459 --> 07:58.976
SURE. TAKE
ALL THE TIME YOU NEED.

07:59.044 --> 07:59.977
THANK YOU.

08:01.947 --> 08:03.381
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
YOU DON'T LIKE THE PLACE?

08:03.449 --> 08:08.653
UM, WELL, IT IS GROOVY.
I WILL GIVE YOU THAT.

08:08.721 --> 08:11.422
BUT, UH, I THOUGHT WE BOTH
LOVED THE OTHER HOUSE.

08:11.490 --> 08:14.191
THE PLACE WAS OK. BUT THIS
PLACE HAS GOT MUCH BETTER FLOW.

08:14.259 --> 08:15.259
NOT TO MENTION
THE INTERCOM,

08:15.326 --> 08:17.278
THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE,
THE DUMBWAITER,

08:17.346 --> 08:20.381
AND SHE COMES FURNISHED!

08:20.449 --> 08:22.767
UM, HONEY, I LOVE YOU,

08:22.834 --> 08:24.835
AND I LOVE WHEN YOU
GET EXCITED ABOUT THINGS

08:24.903 --> 08:26.553
LIKE A HOUSE
OR A NEW CEREAL,

08:26.622 --> 08:29.423
BUT, UM...

08:29.491 --> 08:32.458
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT
DECISION WE'RE MAKING HERE.

08:32.527 --> 08:33.961
I KNOW IT IS.

08:34.029 --> 08:35.763
THE OTHER HOUSE
WAS SO PERFECT FOR US.

08:35.831 --> 08:37.264
I MEAN, IT HAD
THE ROOM WE NEEDED.

08:37.332 --> 08:39.100
IT WAS IN
A QUIET NEIGHBORHOOD.

08:39.167 --> 08:40.101
IT WAS CLOSE
TO YOUR WORK.

08:40.168 --> 08:41.235
I MEAN, THIS HOUSE IS-

08:41.303 --> 08:43.986
IT'S FUN, BUT
IT'S JUST NOT PRACTICAL.

08:44.054 --> 08:45.606
OH, REALLY?
YEAH.

08:45.757 --> 08:47.658
OK, LET ME PAINT
A PICTURE FOR YA.

08:47.726 --> 08:49.927
WE'RE IN THAT OTHER HOUSE.
YOU'RE IN BED.

08:49.994 --> 08:51.495
YOU'RE IN THE MOOD
FOR PORK CHOPS.

08:51.563 --> 08:54.065
BOTH YOUR LEGS
ARE BROKEN.

08:57.168 --> 08:58.603
OK.

08:58.670 --> 09:03.006
NOW COINCIDENTALLY, I'M DOWN IN
THE KITCHEN FRYING PORK CHOPS.

09:03.074 --> 09:07.144
THE SMELL WAFTS UP TO YOU,
AND YOU SHOUT DOWN TO ME.

09:07.212 --> 09:10.848
BUT I CAN'T HEAR YOU 'CAUSE
WE DON'T HAVE AN INTERCOM.

09:12.283 --> 09:14.018
NOW IT TURNS OUT
I'M A NICE GUY,

09:14.086 --> 09:15.853
AND I WANNA GET YOU
THOSE PORK CHOPS.

09:15.921 --> 09:18.005
SO I GO TO SEND 'EM UP
IN THE DUMBWAITER.

09:18.073 --> 09:20.808
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ONE.

09:20.876 --> 09:23.377
SO I WALK THE PORK CHOPS TO
YA, BUT THE HOUSE HAS NO FLOW,

09:23.445 --> 09:24.646
AND I WIND UP
IN THE BASEMENT

09:24.713 --> 09:26.347
AND YOU STARVE TO DEATH.

09:26.414 --> 09:30.668
OK, HERE'S THE THING
- I MEAN, WE COULD TALK ABOUT THIS ALL NIGHT,

09:30.736 --> 09:33.104
BUT THE OTHER COUPLE IS GONNA
MAKE AN OFFER ON THAT HOUSE,

09:33.171 --> 09:35.640
AND I DON'T WANNA LOSE IT
BECAUSE OF A DUMBWAITER.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.709
OK, MAYBE YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHAT WE HAVE HERE.

09:37.776 --> 09:41.396
THIS IS A PRIVATE ELEVATOR
FOR PORK.

09:41.463 --> 09:46.183
YES, AND I APPRECIATE THAT.
BUT COME ON, HONEY.

09:46.251 --> 09:48.453
THIS HOUSE IS ACROSS
THE STREET FROM A SCHOOL.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.020
DO YOU KNOW HOW NOISY
THAT'S GONNA BE?

09:50.088 --> 09:54.074
CARRIE, LISTEN TO ME. MEAT
GOIN' UP, BONES COMIN' DOWN.

09:54.142 --> 09:55.943
AND THEN WHAT ABOUT
WHEN WE HAVE A BABY?

09:56.010 --> 09:59.012
YOU WANNA CARRY A BABY UP
AND DOWN THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE?

09:59.080 --> 10:00.715
AGAIN, DUMBWAITER!

10:00.782 --> 10:03.016
BABY GOES UP,
BABY COME DOWN.

10:03.084 --> 10:05.303
ALL RIGHT.
WOULD YOU STOP?

10:05.370 --> 10:07.504
NOW LOOK, WE ARE GONNA
BUY THAT OTHER HOUSE,

10:07.572 --> 10:09.439
AND WE'RE
GONNA BE VERY HAPPY,

10:09.507 --> 10:11.041
AND IF
YOU CAN'T SURVIVE

10:11.109 --> 10:14.278
WITHOUT PORK CHOPS BEING
HOISTED UP TO THE BEDROOM,

10:14.345 --> 10:18.015
THEN WE'LL STRING A BUCKET
OUTSIDE THE WINDOW FOR YOU, OK?

10:18.083 --> 10:20.101
GOOD.
I'M GLAD THAT'S SETTLED.

10:20.168 --> 10:21.501
AND SHAVE
THAT MUSTACHE OFF

10:21.569 --> 10:23.337
'CAUSE YOU LOOK
LIKE A MOTORCYCLE COP.

10:38.920 --> 10:40.888
HEY, HOMESLICE.

10:40.955 --> 10:43.424
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

10:43.492 --> 10:44.425
AW, NOTHIN'.

10:44.493 --> 10:46.427
SHAVIN' THE 'STACHE.

10:46.495 --> 10:48.863
LOSIN'
THE 'STACHE. WOW.

10:48.930 --> 10:51.231
YEAH, I WAS THINKIN'
IT'S A LITTLE TOO, UH...

10:51.299 --> 10:53.083
MOTORCYCLE COP.

10:53.151 --> 10:55.085
REALLY? 'CAUSE TO ME,
IT WAS MORE

10:55.153 --> 10:57.587
OUT-OF-SHAPE PORN STAR.
YOU KNOW.

10:57.655 --> 10:59.456
SO WHAT'S UP WITH THE HOUSE
WITH THE DUMBWAITER?

10:59.524 --> 11:02.459
OH, WE'RE, UH, ACTUALLY MAKING
AN OFFER ON ANOTHER HOUSE.

11:02.527 --> 11:04.361
HEH HEH HEH.
SHE BEAT YOU DOWN, HUH?

11:04.429 --> 11:05.996
NO. WE HAD A DISCUSSION,

11:06.064 --> 11:07.998
AND SHE MADE A LOT
OF VERY GOOD POINTS.

11:08.066 --> 11:10.034
THIS HOUSE IS BETTER.
YOU KNOW, IT'S ROOMY.

11:10.101 --> 11:12.837
IT'S CLOSE TO HERE. ON A NICE
DAY, I CAN ACTUALLY WALK TO WORK.

11:12.904 --> 11:15.906
<i>HEH, WALK TO WORK. YOU DON'T
EVEN LIKE TO WALK AT WORK.</i>

11:15.974 --> 11:16.991
ADMIT IT, MAN.
SHE BEAT YOU DOWN.

11:17.058 --> 11:19.193
AIN'T NO SHAME
HERE, BABY.

11:19.261 --> 11:21.228
SHE DIDN'T
BEAT ME DOWN, OK?

11:21.296 --> 11:23.397
I WANT THAT HOUSE, AND I
WANNA SHAVE MY MUSTACHE,

11:23.464 --> 11:24.832
AND WE'RE NOT
GETTING A DOG ANYMORE.

11:24.900 --> 11:27.334
WE'RE GETTIN' A KITTEN
'CAUSE I THINK CATS ARE FUN.

11:30.238 --> 11:31.939
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT AM I SAYING?

11:32.007 --> 11:33.908
CATS ARE BRUTAL!

11:33.975 --> 11:35.442
AND I WANT
MY MUSTACHE BACK.

11:35.510 --> 11:38.078
OH, MY GOD.
HERE'S A LITTLE.

11:38.146 --> 11:40.514
DOUG,
IT'S-IT'S GONE.

11:40.582 --> 11:43.384
OH, MY- WHAT AM I DOIN'?
WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE?

11:43.451 --> 11:45.253
I MEAN, EVERYTHING WAS
GOIN' SO GREAT WITH CARRIE.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.121
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN
SO SWEET AND FUN,

11:47.189 --> 11:52.493
AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN,
SHE'S, LIKE RRRARRGH!

11:52.560 --> 11:53.661
OH, YEAH, YEAH,
I GOT THAT ONE

11:53.728 --> 11:55.296
ON MY HONEYMOON.
HEH HEH!

11:55.363 --> 11:56.597
MAN, IF CARRIE'S
LIKE THIS NOW,

11:56.665 --> 11:58.365
WHAT'S SHE GONNA BE
LIKE 10 YEARS FROM NOW?

11:58.433 --> 11:59.734
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT.

11:59.801 --> 12:01.301
10 YEARS FROM NOW.

12:01.369 --> 12:04.171
THAT'S, LIKE, 2004.

12:06.574 --> 12:08.075
DON'T BE LATE
TONIGHT, OK?

12:08.143 --> 12:10.310
REMEMBER, WE HAVE TO GO TO THE BALLET.

12:10.378 --> 12:13.213
ACTUALLY, TONIGHT I WAS THINK
ABOUT WATCHING THE KNICK GAME.

12:13.281 --> 12:15.249
RRRARRGH!

12:15.316 --> 12:16.667
GOOD POINT.

12:16.734 --> 12:18.602
ALL RIGHT. I GOTTA
GET GOING TO WORK.

12:18.670 --> 12:20.871
ALL RIGHT. AND PICK UP YOUR BLUE SUIT

12:20.939 --> 12:22.606
FROM THE DRY
CLEANERS, OK?

12:22.674 --> 12:24.908
I GOTTA WEAR A SUIT?

12:24.976 --> 12:27.978
YES, A SUIT, AND YOUR
UNCOMFORTABLE SHOES.

12:28.046 --> 12:29.880
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

12:29.948 --> 12:31.248
OK.

12:34.086 --> 12:35.569
AND PICK ME UP
A LOAF OF BREAD!

12:42.043 --> 12:43.276
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:43.344 --> 12:45.045
THIS MUSTACHE
IS STAYING.

12:45.113 --> 12:47.481
ACTUALLY,
IT'S HALF A MUSTACHE.

12:50.118 --> 12:52.486
STILL STAYING.

12:52.554 --> 12:55.239
DARLING, THE TIDE HAS
TURNED FOR ARTHUR SPOONER

12:55.307 --> 12:57.891
IN THE RIBBON GAME.
WITH ANY LUCK,

12:57.959 --> 12:59.627
THIS WILL BE MY BEST YEAR

12:59.695 --> 13:01.895
SINCE THE HOSTAGE CRISIS.

13:01.963 --> 13:05.182
GREAT, DAD.
WELL, WHAT HAPPENED?

13:05.250 --> 13:08.786
I REALIZED, "WHY DO I
NEED BIG DEPARTMENT STORES

13:08.853 --> 13:10.921
WHEN I CAN GO
DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE?"

13:10.989 --> 13:13.440
THINK ABOUT IT. WHO WEARS
RIBBONS IN THEIR HAIR?

13:13.508 --> 13:14.875
LITTLE GIRLS.

13:14.943 --> 13:17.711
AND WHERE DO YOU FIND
LITTLE GIRLS?

13:17.779 --> 13:20.080
IN THE SCHOOLYARD.

13:27.321 --> 13:28.472
OH, BOY.

13:28.540 --> 13:29.507
IT WORKED LIKE A CHARM.

13:29.574 --> 13:31.642
I'D BECKON A LITTLE GIRL
OFF THE SWINGS

13:31.709 --> 13:33.777
WITH THE PROMISE
OF A CANDY TREAT,

13:33.845 --> 13:35.212
AND THEN I PRESENT HER

13:35.280 --> 13:38.215
WITH A BEAUTIFUL
FAUX VELVET RIBBON.

13:38.283 --> 13:41.452
THEY RAN OFF
SCREAMING, "MOMMY!"

13:41.520 --> 13:43.954
THEY COULDN'T WAIT
TO TELL THEIR MOTHER

13:44.022 --> 13:46.557
ABOUT THEIR ENCOUNTER
WITH THE RIBBON MAN.

13:48.493 --> 13:50.577
DAD, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

13:50.645 --> 13:51.612
SURE, I CAN.

13:51.679 --> 13:53.947
AND AFTER
A NICE SNACK,

13:54.015 --> 13:56.783
I'M GONNA HIT THE
PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS.

13:56.851 --> 13:59.403
NO, YOU WON'T!

13:59.471 --> 14:00.804
YOU CAN'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

14:00.872 --> 14:03.157
I AM DOING IT, OK?

14:03.225 --> 14:04.458
NOW LOOK, I GOTTA GO
MEET DOUG AT THE HOUSE

14:04.526 --> 14:06.994
TO SIGN SOME PAPERS.
YOU STAY RIGHT THERE

14:07.061 --> 14:09.663
UNTIL I GET BACK. OH, AND
COME HERE. YOU HAVE SOMETHING

14:09.731 --> 14:10.831
ON YOUR THING.
OK, GOOD.

14:10.898 --> 14:12.266
HEY, HEY!
THESE ARE MINE NOW!

14:12.334 --> 14:14.101
YOU CAN'T TAKE MY
CANDY TREATS! I DID IT!

14:14.169 --> 14:15.169
I'LL GET MORE!

14:15.237 --> 14:16.970
AND I TOOK
YOUR CAR KEYS, TOO!

14:17.038 --> 14:19.723
DAMN.
NEEDLESS TO SAY,

14:19.791 --> 14:21.659
YOU'RE DEAD TO ME!

14:27.782 --> 14:29.966
OK. THIS JUST CONFIRMS

14:30.034 --> 14:33.237
THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR
AN 8-DAY INSPECTION PERIOD

14:33.305 --> 14:36.157
AND 14 DAYS
TO SECURE YOUR LOAN.

14:36.224 --> 14:37.958
WHY DON'T YOU
LOOK THAT OVER?

14:38.026 --> 14:39.260
I'LL GO GRAB

14:39.327 --> 14:42.263
OK, THANKS.

14:42.330 --> 14:43.930
WASSUP?

14:46.067 --> 14:49.236
HEY, BABE. WE GOT A
MILLION PAPERS TO SIGN HERE.

14:49.304 --> 14:51.938
I WANT YOU TO START
WORKING ON THESE.

14:52.006 --> 14:55.242
ALL RIGHTY. HMM.

14:58.113 --> 15:00.931
UH, BABE? I THINK
YOU MISSED A SPOT.

15:00.999 --> 15:04.902
NO, DON'T THINK I DID.
I'M STARTING A NEW TREND.

15:04.969 --> 15:06.287
I'M EITHER GONNA
CALL IT HALF-STACHE

15:06.354 --> 15:08.455
OR UPPER LIP SURPRISE.

15:08.523 --> 15:10.257
DOUG,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:10.325 --> 15:12.293
WHAT'S GOING ON?
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

15:12.360 --> 15:15.495
I WAS STANDING THERE SHAVING MY
MUSTACHE LIKE YOU ORDERED ME TO,

15:15.563 --> 15:18.132
WHEN HALFWAY THROUGH THE
JOB DOUG HEFFERNAN SHOWED UP

15:18.200 --> 15:20.083
AND SAID, "WHAT ARE
YOU DOING, ASS?!"

15:22.587 --> 15:24.488
OK. YOU WANT TO
KEEP THE MUSTACHE?

15:24.555 --> 15:26.257
KEEP THE MUSTACHE.
IT LOOKS GREAT.

15:26.324 --> 15:28.192
NO, IT'S NOT JUST STOPPING
WITH THE MUSTACHE, OK?

15:28.260 --> 15:29.459
I WANT THAT OTHER HOUSE.

15:29.527 --> 15:33.330
WHA-DOUG, COME ON! WE'VE
ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS.

15:33.398 --> 15:35.532
NOW WE'RE HERE
TO SIGN PAPERS

15:35.600 --> 15:37.467
AND MAKE AN OFFER
ON THIS HOUSE.

15:37.535 --> 15:39.270
NO, WE DIDN'T DISCUSS IT.
YOU STEAMROLLED ME,

15:39.337 --> 15:40.637
AND I'M
NOT SIGNING ANYTHING

15:40.705 --> 15:42.439
UNTIL WE TALK
ABOUT IT FOR REAL.

15:42.507 --> 15:43.607
ALL RIGHT, FINE. YOU
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

15:43.675 --> 15:44.842
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.
TELL ME WHY

15:44.910 --> 15:45.976
WE SHOULD BUY
THAT OTHER HOUSE

15:46.044 --> 15:47.845
WITHOUT USING
THE WORDS PORK CHOPS

15:47.913 --> 15:48.913
OR DUMBWAITER.

15:51.299 --> 15:52.716
YOU KNOW
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE!

15:53.952 --> 15:55.585
THEN THIS DISCUSSION
IS OVER.

15:55.654 --> 15:56.820
OK, FINE! YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:56.888 --> 15:58.088
LET'S JUST GO WITH THE
HOUSE YOU WANT, ALL RIGHT?

15:58.156 --> 15:59.523
HEY, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
HERE'S A GREAT IDEA.

15:59.590 --> 16:00.991
YOU TOLD ME ONCE
YOU LIKED THE NAME MIKE.

16:01.059 --> 16:03.293
SO FROM NOW ON,
MY NAME'S MIKE.

16:03.361 --> 16:04.427
ALL RIGHT?
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

16:04.495 --> 16:06.063
YOU KNOW WHAT? I
SHOULD SHAVE MY MUSTACHE.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.364
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

16:07.431 --> 16:08.365
WHAT THE HECK?
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:08.432 --> 16:10.367

16:10.434 --> 16:11.434
HOW ABOUT IN HERE? YEAH!

16:11.502 --> 16:13.653
AM I HAIRLESS ENOUGH
FOR YOU?

16:13.721 --> 16:17.391
SMOOTH MIKE! THAT'S
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA CALL ME!

16:17.459 --> 16:19.393
Nipple!

16:22.097 --> 16:23.797
DOUG, COME ON.

16:23.864 --> 16:25.499
YOU JUST
HAVE TO TRUST ME.

16:25.567 --> 16:28.502
I JUST KNOW THAT I'M
RIGHT ABOUT THIS HOUSE.

16:33.341 --> 16:35.409
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

16:35.477 --> 16:38.011
YOU KNOW, I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT TO SAY ANYMORE.

16:38.079 --> 16:41.881
I JUST THOUGHT
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED,

16:41.949 --> 16:43.917
YOU KNOW, WE WERE
LIKE PARTNERS.

16:43.985 --> 16:46.453
AND YOU WOULD
RESPECT MY OPINION

16:46.521 --> 16:49.740
OR AT LEAST
PRETEND TO.

16:49.808 --> 16:52.609
I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT.
ALL RIGHT? I LOVE YOU.

16:52.677 --> 16:55.629
OK? I DON'T CARE
WHERE WE LIVE

16:55.696 --> 16:58.382
AS LONG
AS WE'RE TOGETHER.

16:58.449 --> 17:01.618
LET'S JUST DO THIS.

17:01.686 --> 17:03.420
NO, STOP, STOP.

17:03.488 --> 17:04.637
WHAT?

17:04.704 --> 17:06.740
LOOK...

17:06.807 --> 17:09.175
DOUG, I'M JUST

17:09.243 --> 17:11.377
YOU KNOW,
WITH MY DAD, AND...

17:11.445 --> 17:13.913
I DON'T WANT TO BE
LIKE THAT WITH YOU.

17:15.066 --> 17:18.768
YOU'RE A SMART GUY,
AND I LOVE YOU.

17:18.836 --> 17:20.253
YOU KNOW WHAT? I WANT YOU TO PICK OUT

17:20.321 --> 17:21.887
THE HOUSE
THAT WE BUY.

17:23.358 --> 17:24.575

17:24.642 --> 17:26.209
YEAH.

17:28.061 --> 17:29.329
OHH.

17:33.718 --> 17:37.037
CARRIE, WE'RE GONNA

18:04.065 --> 18:05.932
DOUG, FOOD'S HERE!

18:11.823 --> 18:13.540
SORRY

18:13.608 --> 18:16.243
THERE'S LIKE 50 SCHOOL BUSES DOWN THERE.

18:16.311 --> 18:17.677
GOD, THAT WOULD
MAKE ME NUTS.

18:17.745 --> 18:19.079
WOULD IT?

18:21.449 --> 18:24.601
DAD! GET AWAY
FROM THOSE LITTLE GIRLS!

18:25.970 --> 18:26.970
OH, GOD.

18:28.139 --> 18:30.507
OHH! IT'S OK.
JUST A RUG BURN.

18:30.575 --> 18:34.244
UNH! WE GOTTA REMEMBER
TO CONE THIS AREA OFF.

18:35.613 --> 18:37.748
ALL RIGHT. CAN WE JUST EAT
UP IN THE BEDROOM, PLEASE?

18:37.815 --> 18:39.750
IT'S MUCH QUIETER
UP THERE.

18:39.817 --> 18:42.586
YEAH, NO PROBLEM. HEY, WE'LL
JUST USE THE DUMBWAITER.

18:42.654 --> 18:45.355
ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO.

18:45.423 --> 18:47.157

OH, YEAH!

18:58.286 --> 19:02.155

19:02.223 --> 19:04.491
OH, WE ARE EATING IN NO TIME!

19:04.558 --> 19:06.894
EATING
IN NO TIME!

19:10.765 --> 19:13.133
OH, YEAH.

19:13.201 --> 19:15.135
OH,
THIS IS GREAT.

19:30.918 --> 19:34.321
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A TINY CLEANING LADY.

19:35.840 --> 19:38.926
OH, NO, NO, NO!
DON'T CRY!

19:38.993 --> 19:42.529
I PROMISE. EVERY BIG DECISION
FROM NOW ON YOU'LL MAKE.

19:42.597 --> 19:44.414
YOU THINK?

19:49.070 --> 19:50.904
THAT'S HOW I LEARNED THAT LITTLE GIRLS

19:50.972 --> 19:53.924
ARE MADE OF
SUGAR AND SPICE...

19:53.991 --> 19:55.892
AND LIES!

19:58.263 --> 20:01.432
IT WORKED OUT FINE. I
MEAN, WE GOT OUR HOUSE.

20:01.499 --> 20:06.202
YEAH. AFTER 6 MONTHS
AND AN EXTRA $19,000.

20:06.270 --> 20:08.305
UH-HUH, MM-HMM.

20:12.677 --> 20:13.993
DOUG!
WHAT?

20:14.061 --> 20:15.495
WE SAID YOU'D MAKE ALL
THE MAJOR DECISIONS.

20:15.563 --> 20:16.930
THIS IS
JUST A CHAIN SAW.

20:18.766 --> 20:20.267
UGH! FINE.

20:20.334 --> 20:22.302
UH, YOU CAN FORGET
ABOUT THE SAW,

20:22.370 --> 20:24.121
BUT I'D LIKE
