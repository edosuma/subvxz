Astor?

00:24.825 --> 00:26.058
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:26.060 --> 00:29.895
You wanted to, um, talk about Mila.

00:29.897 --> 00:32.231
We broke up yesterday.

00:32.232 --> 00:34.666
You were dating her?

00:34.668 --> 00:40.039
Um... I want you
to help me get her back.

00:40.041 --> 00:42.341
Oh, Mila and I aren't friends anymore.

00:42.343 --> 00:45.177
That's okay.
She hasn't changed at all.

00:45.179 --> 00:47.246
Oh, well, you're probably
better off, then.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.248
She was never interested in people

00:49.250 --> 00:50.916
for the right reasons, anyway.

00:50.918 --> 00:53.352
Yeah.

00:53.354 --> 00:56.188
Look, Mila wants a ladies man,

00:56.190 --> 01:00.592
confident guy who gets all the girls.

01:02.228 --> 01:05.030
It's not you, is it?

01:05.032 --> 01:07.800
I could learn.

01:07.802 --> 01:11.570
You could teach me.

01:11.572 --> 01:14.173
I just need techniques that work.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.619
4:00?

01:27.621 --> 01:29.021
3 past.

01:29.023 --> 01:30.689
Would you like to grab a coffee?

01:30.691 --> 01:31.790
You had to ask the time

01:31.792 --> 01:33.792
before you knew you wanted to ask me out?

01:33.794 --> 01:35.027
Asking the time was my in.

01:35.029 --> 01:36.795
I couldn't hit on you straight up.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.297
Well, you should've asked straight up.
It shows confidence.

01:38.299 --> 01:41.166
Okay. Okay.
Let's go again.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.435
Hey, what's up, girl?

01:43.437 --> 01:45.237
Want to roll with me, get some coffee?

01:45.239 --> 01:46.772
Yeah, I want to roll with you,

01:46.774 --> 01:48.907
right off my feet off the
sidewalk and into the gutter.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.843
- Let's do it.
- Ain't happening.

01:50.845 --> 01:52.978
You're putting on a persona.
Are you an actor?

01:52.980 --> 01:55.547
- No.
- Then why are you acting up now?

01:55.549 --> 01:57.216
Hold the bus.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.384
12:00. May not be possible.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.320
10:00, 11:00,
stop thinking with your cock.

02:01.322 --> 02:02.654
What are you hesitating for?
Go.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.523
I can't run after her.
That's desperate.

02:04.525 --> 02:05.991
You said never look desperate.

02:05.993 --> 02:08.293
You know the deal. Go now.

02:09.461 --> 02:11.130
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

02:11.132 --> 02:13.265
Um, sorry, can I ask you a question?

02:13.267 --> 02:14.867
Sure, spit it out.

02:14.869 --> 02:17.302
- Oh, that's charming.
- Prince charming.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.505
- Well, what's the question?
- Can I buy you a coffee?

02:19.507 --> 02:21.773
How long is this question
you have to ask me

02:21.775 --> 02:23.075
over a cup of coffee?

02:23.077 --> 02:24.810
That's the question.

02:24.812 --> 02:26.078
I don't even know you.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.513
I thought you were, I don't know,

02:27.515 --> 02:29.515
doing some environmental survey
or something.

02:29.517 --> 02:33.752
No, I'm just a boy
asking a girl for a coffee.

02:33.754 --> 02:38.223
See that machine in there...
coffee is only $1.

02:38.225 --> 02:41.660
Yeah. Go get high.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.767
Congratulations.
Your first win.

02:48.769 --> 02:49.968
If I was begging.

02:49.970 --> 02:52.204
Asking a random cutie
straight up at this stage

02:52.206 --> 02:53.772
was guaranteed to get you knocked back.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.641
- That was the plan.
- An evil plan.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.943
To get you used to being knocked back.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.211
Didn't hurt much, did it?

02:59.213 --> 03:02.214
Hurt like a paper cut on my eyelid.

03:02.216 --> 03:03.849
No pain, no game.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.851
So you're saying I got game?

03:05.853 --> 03:07.986
You're <i> playing</i> the game.
You haven't <i> got</i> game.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.955
- But I be a player, yo.
- All in good time.

03:09.957 --> 03:12.324
Right now, you pay to play.
You got the money?

03:12.326 --> 03:13.926
I have to pay you?

03:13.928 --> 03:17.663
No, I was just being silly,
but seriously, can I borrow $20?

03:26.206 --> 03:28.006
Here you are, sir.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.108
- Hey, you idiot.
- What?

03:30.110 --> 03:32.244
- Oh! Oh! I-I-I-I...
- What is this?

03:32.246 --> 03:34.112
What am I supposed to do with this?

03:34.114 --> 03:35.781
III-I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.417
I didn't... you should... but
buy your... buy another soda.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.552
Buy yourself a soda.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.820
Okay.

03:41.822 --> 03:45.591
Sorry, is my son bothering you?
Come on, astor.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.559
- Idiot.
- Very sorry.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.528
So, how did you and Mila get together?

03:49.530 --> 03:51.163
Well, let me tell you about it.

03:56.402 --> 03:59.538
Must've been the mixing drinks.

03:59.540 --> 04:04.476
Sambuca and bloody Marys don't
really go well to-together.

04:04.478 --> 04:07.079
- Just one more cabernet.

I love you, too, Mila.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.317
Cold.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.252
It's cold in your house.

05:54.254 --> 05:56.321
I just puked in my mouth.

05:56.323 --> 05:57.522
I told you to go easy.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.924
It's not the liquor.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.926
It's your sob childhood sweetheart tale.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.661
More than half the world is female,

06:02.663 --> 06:05.063
and you hold out
for someone you liked as a kid.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.264
It's kind of pedophilic.

06:06.266 --> 06:07.766
True love lasts the ages.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.268
True love involves sex, not abstinence.

06:10.270 --> 06:11.603
You skipped teenage sex

06:11.605 --> 06:13.905
because your 4-year-old self
had a crush?

06:13.907 --> 06:16.908
I was a late developer. Highest
vocal range in the church choir.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.344
Oh, so pedophilia came
naturally to you, then.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.613
She was worth the wait.

06:30.356 --> 06:31.790
Sip.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.692
Rinse.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.429
Spit.

06:41.434 --> 06:43.402
Smile.

06:45.705 --> 06:47.706
Kiss.

07:02.021 --> 07:05.824
21 years and 43 days since our last kiss.

07:05.826 --> 07:09.394
Wow.
I think I remember.

07:09.396 --> 07:12.464
It was behind the toilets, right?

07:12.466 --> 07:14.065
Did we just kiss?

07:14.067 --> 07:16.401
- We were 4 years old.
- Right, so probably just kissed.

07:16.403 --> 07:18.970
That'd be weird.

07:18.972 --> 07:22.441
Who do you think's gonna be
happier... your mom or mine?

07:23.576 --> 07:25.310
Probably yours.

07:25.312 --> 07:27.879
Yeah, you're probably right.

07:27.881 --> 07:31.349
She knows you're everything I ever wanted.

07:31.351 --> 07:33.151
Blind confessions of love

07:33.153 --> 07:35.120
ain't gonna cut it with a girl like Mila.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.322
If you're too sweet,
you'll turn most girls off.

07:37.324 --> 07:41.693
You need attitude, edge, and
a hell of a lot more confidence.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.128
You paying attention?

07:43.130 --> 07:45.163
- I'm taking notes.
- No, stop.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.699
You've got to let it flow,
not produce a paper on it.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.234
When you're a player, you'll know.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.503
The girls will know,
and everything will be easy,

07:51.505 --> 07:53.205
like shooting fish in a barrel.

07:55.742 --> 07:57.142
Hi.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.577
Hi.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.712
One for every day we've been together.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.681
Just like Monday.

08:03.916 --> 08:05.684
- How's your paper going?
- Good.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.385
So unfair you get all this work

08:07.387 --> 08:09.221
right when we've become a couple.

08:09.223 --> 08:10.822
Yeah. I know.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.025
I can't really stay out that
late either tonight. Sorry.

08:13.026 --> 08:16.628
I've got some good news.
I started studying cardiology.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.997
I'm not gonna get a degree like you,

08:18.999 --> 08:23.335
but I thought perhaps
I could help you study.

08:23.337 --> 08:26.238
That's really... that's sweet.

08:27.607 --> 08:30.876
I've got another surprise, too.

08:31.878 --> 08:34.412
But I'll tell you...
I'll tell you about it.

08:34.414 --> 08:37.616
I've always been here beside you.

08:37.618 --> 08:41.318
Your beauty weakens my knees.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.321
You never knew.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.023
How could you?

08:45.025 --> 08:49.528
Each glance and every word a tease.

08:50.997 --> 08:54.132
I couldn't believe it when I had you.

08:54.134 --> 08:57.736
I never thought I'd break through.

08:57.738 --> 09:00.438
I could only barely hold back the tears

09:00.440 --> 09:05.443
from my... Deep and frightful
fears.

09:05.445 --> 09:08.647
This bond is new.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.850
Though it'll go on
after we've turned to dust,

09:11.852 --> 09:14.753

Oh, the main symptoms
of V.T. are... no cheating...

11:20.280 --> 11:23.715
palpitations, light-headedness,
and...?

11:23.717 --> 11:25.316
I think I have V.T.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.419
I'm serious.
I think I have V.T.

11:27.421 --> 11:31.222
I don't want to do the exam.
Will you do it for me? Please?

11:31.224 --> 11:32.724
I will do anything.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.092
- Anything?
- Well...

11:34.094 --> 11:36.327
...Maybe not anything.

11:36.329 --> 11:39.864
Hey. So, this is the guy
you've been hiding?

11:39.866 --> 11:42.767
Hi. I am astor,
and, yes, I am the boyfriend.

11:42.769 --> 11:44.402
- Hi, I'm Jenny.
- Hi, Jenny.

11:44.404 --> 11:45.937
- Astor.
- Oh. Hi.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.138
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:47.140 --> 11:50.141
Whoa.
Sorry.

11:50.143 --> 11:53.478
Boyfriend?

11:53.480 --> 11:57.382
Want to come pump some iron?
Boost your testosterone?

11:57.384 --> 12:00.618
My doctor says I shouldn't...

12:00.620 --> 12:03.888
got enough testosterone as it is.

12:05.157 --> 12:06.858
Hey, um, did Mila tell you

12:06.860 --> 12:09.094
about my birthday party on Saturday?

12:09.096 --> 12:11.763
I was just telling him about
your birthday party on Saturday.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.832
Sounds like fun.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.300
- Cool.
- Yeah.

12:15.302 --> 12:16.835
Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.436
Lucky you got out of that one.

12:18.438 --> 12:19.804
I got her an 89.

12:19.806 --> 12:21.206
You did her exam?

12:21.208 --> 12:22.974
II could've got it in the 90s

12:22.976 --> 12:25.043
if I just knew my aortic stenosis.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.412
Any of this help with your zoology degree?

12:27.414 --> 12:30.682
My average dropped 10% with
the extracurricular studies.

12:30.684 --> 12:32.250
I should've played hard to get.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.987
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

12:35.989 --> 12:37.889
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

12:37.891 --> 12:40.058
Kiss! Kiss his face!

12:40.060 --> 12:41.259
Oh!

12:41.261 --> 12:43.695
What?!

12:43.697 --> 12:45.463
I was... I was gonna do it!

12:45.465 --> 12:48.166
I know. It's fine.
It's not your fault.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.869
All right. Astor.
Your turn, buddy.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.337
Truth or dare?

12:52.339 --> 12:55.106
Truth.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.242
What is Mila like in bed?
Boom!

12:57.244 --> 12:58.510
Jake, come on.

12:58.512 --> 13:00.011
You don't have to answer that.

13:00.013 --> 13:04.916
A taste of warm honey.

13:04.918 --> 13:11.289
A touch to lift the hairs on your neck.

13:11.291 --> 13:15.960
A tongue alive with fire and talent.

13:15.962 --> 13:19.764
And a heart that burns
with enveloping heat.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.733
Wow.

13:21.735 --> 13:23.935
That's beautiful.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.337
- Yeah.
- Well, we're in love.

13:26.339 --> 13:30.708
Paging Dr. I am in love.
Dr. I am in love.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.644
- He's in the honeymoon period.
- Dr... I don't...

13:32.646 --> 13:35.213
Look at you. Heart on your sleeve.
You're unstoppable.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.815
If you feel it, say it, sister.

13:36.817 --> 13:40.218
She's pretty amazing. Hey,
what else do you like about her?

13:40.220 --> 13:44.022
I love the way
she looks on my bed.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.826
- I love the noises she makes.
- Astor.

13:47.828 --> 13:51.596
No, the noise... the noises
she makes when she sleeps.

13:53.432 --> 13:55.099
She's the one.

13:55.101 --> 13:58.069
I never wanted anyone else.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.209
Okay, I-I think it's your turn,
astor.

14:04.211 --> 14:06.978
I'm sure everybody else
has stories to share, right?

14:06.980 --> 14:08.613
Yeah, who do you choose?

14:08.615 --> 14:12.417
I choose... Mila.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.419
Truth or dare?

14:14.421 --> 14:16.888
Anything but truth.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.990
So, that's how she got frostbite.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.391
I thought it was a myth.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.460
I thought I was letting her off the hook.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.096
I mean, who knew licking
a freezer could be so dangerous.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.798
She couldn't even kiss after that.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.266
Is she a good kisser?

14:28.268 --> 14:30.134
She's got a fiery tongue.

14:30.136 --> 14:31.636
But when I said that,

14:31.638 --> 14:33.438
I was actually talking about
her propensity for anger.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.639
Oh.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.574
I feel like I'm in junior high

14:36.576 --> 14:39.177
dating a 15-year-old
swimming-pool lifeguard.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.079
Surprised he didn't give me a hickey.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.714
I think he's cute.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.883
I can't be with someone who's
still learning how to undo a bra

14:44.885 --> 14:47.418
and confuses honeymoon period with love.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.655
I mean, I-I need someone
who understands women.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.323
You could teach him.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.592
And be his tricycle while he
learns how to ride a bicycle?

14:54.594 --> 14:55.960
No, thank you.

14:55.962 --> 14:57.328
Look, he'll settle into the relationship.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.631
He keeps giving me flowers
and more flowers.

14:59.633 --> 15:02.500
They're always tulips.
They're not even fragrant.

15:02.502 --> 15:03.735
I love tulips.

15:03.737 --> 15:06.537
I’m serious.
I am... I'm done dating boys.

15:06.539 --> 15:11.009
I want a man who has a choice
in women and picks me.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.711
Look, I think
you found someone unique, okay?

15:13.713 --> 15:16.981
Yeah, uniquely inexperienced.
Goodnight.

15:16.983 --> 15:19.584
Goodnight.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.434
Have you ever been in love?

15:36.436 --> 15:41.005
I'm not the kind of girl
that falls in love.

15:41.007 --> 15:44.509
You've had your heart broken, too.

15:44.511 --> 15:48.646
He must've been a pretty special guy.

15:48.648 --> 15:49.847
Nice try.

15:51.584 --> 15:56.087
You know you might not
be able to win Mila back.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.922
It's worth a shot.

15:57.924 --> 16:00.124
You're gonna take some hits.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.459
Hit me, bitch.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.027
I won't be the one hitting you,

16:03.029 --> 16:04.896
and you won't be calling me bitch.

16:04.898 --> 16:07.298
Biatch!

16:07.300 --> 16:09.867
You got to be strong, okay?
Water off a duck's back.

16:09.869 --> 16:12.003
That's gonna be your motto.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.571
Water off a duck's back.

16:18.377 --> 16:20.578
Please don't make me try that line again.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.214
The line worked on me.
I went home with the guy.

16:23.216 --> 16:24.682
Yeah, a handsome guy, I'm sure.

16:24.684 --> 16:27.118
That's not the point.
It was his delivery.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.753
How did I become your Guinea pig?

16:28.755 --> 16:31.489
I bought you in a pet shop.
Chose you for your soft coat.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.958
Hey, hey, hey.
Sensitive. Sensitive.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.394
Now get Guinea-pigging.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.829
What about her?

16:37.831 --> 16:40.832
You can try him if you like.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.500
Oh, come on.

16:43.970 --> 16:46.904
That girl there.
She's perfect.

16:46.906 --> 16:49.340
Water off a duck's back.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.514
Hi. Sorry, I...

16:56.516 --> 17:01.486
I saw you outside before,
and I think you dropped this.

17:03.156 --> 17:04.922
That is definitely not mine.

17:04.924 --> 17:08.459
Oh, Jesus.
That's embarrassing.

17:08.461 --> 17:09.926
I'm...

17:09.929 --> 17:12.030
Did you say "Jesus"?

17:12.031 --> 17:13.598
I'm Roman catholic,

17:13.599 --> 17:15.900
and I don't believe in
taking the lord's name in vain,

17:15.902 --> 17:19.002
and I certainly don't believe
in sex before marriage.

17:19.005 --> 17:21.271
"Purity."

17:21.273 --> 17:25.108
Well, it's always a good idea
to keep safe.

17:25.111 --> 17:28.012
Stop the spread of STDs.

17:28.013 --> 17:30.948
I'm Roman catholic.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.984
Right.

17:32.986 --> 17:35.853
I might go...

17:35.855 --> 17:39.090
Confess my sins.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.125
What are your sins?

17:41.127 --> 17:46.330
Monogamy, mahogany,
general misuse of wood.

17:46.332 --> 17:50.401
You should definitely
keep that to yourself.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.604
You're not gonna even finish your drink?

17:56.175 --> 17:59.610
How did that line ever work on you?

17:59.612 --> 18:01.746
It was my condom
that I dropped deliberately.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.481
I wanted the guy.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.982
- I told you it'd never work.
- Okay, fine.

18:04.984 --> 18:07.718
But your improvising now,
and you've been knocked back

18:07.720 --> 18:10.088
three times tonight
without even realizing.

18:10.090 --> 18:12.356
Didn't we do this lesson already?

18:12.358 --> 18:13.724
Yes, but it's the most important lesson.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.993
You can't be phased by a rejection.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.228
Okay. Okay. I got it.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.430
Wait.
You can't be phased by anything.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.433
You know the number-one reason
a girl knocks back a guy?

18:22.435 --> 18:24.502
- Wrong line?
- Nerves.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.838
I'm trying to hide my nerves.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.907
<i>Her</i> nerves. A rejection's
often not really a rejection.

18:29.909 --> 18:33.177
It's just a girl being shy,
awkward. Got to ride it out.

18:33.179 --> 18:35.179
Sail the storm to calmer waters.

18:35.181 --> 18:37.348
Exactly.
Keep the conversation going

18:37.350 --> 18:39.016
until it actually becomes a conversation

18:39.018 --> 18:40.685
and not just a pickup line.

18:40.687 --> 18:43.621
Okay, so you're saying I should've
kept talking to mother Mary?

18:43.623 --> 18:45.623
Yeah, well, she had a chastity ring on.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.525
I think you gave her enough time.

18:47.527 --> 18:50.728
She would've spread her legs
eventually but not for a few months.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.263
Charming.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.532
You will be.

18:54.534 --> 18:57.668
Okay. Give me a real technique.

18:57.670 --> 18:58.936
Thanks.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.605
Thank <i>you.</i>

19:00.607 --> 19:03.007
Hey.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.909
Oh.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.410
Oh, sorry.

19:06.412 --> 19:07.979
Excuse me.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.714
I...

19:09.716 --> 19:11.048
Hi.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.617
Hi.

19:13.887 --> 19:15.319
Ooh.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.722
Hi.

19:24.596 --> 19:27.965
Hey, ladies. Drinks for you
courtesy of this guy over here.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.834
- Hey there.
- Hey.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.035
How's it going?

19:31.037 --> 19:32.837
- Hi.
- Cheers.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.138
Cheers.

19:34.140 --> 19:36.541
I love Asian girls.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.609
All right.

19:41.747 --> 19:45.950
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Hey, wait! Come on!

19:48.188 --> 19:50.922
Pardon my French,

19:50.924 --> 19:53.891
but offering to buy girls
drinks... it's fucked.

19:53.893 --> 19:57.528
Well, I can't teach you how
to be a player in one night.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.931
- I-I agree with that.
- Hey.

19:59.933 --> 20:01.199
Yeah.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.601
Sure. Sure.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.203
Oh.

20:06.805 --> 20:08.739
Come on.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.708
Yeah... okay.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.843
Yeah, it works.

20:12.845 --> 20:15.146
It's good. Simple.

20:15.148 --> 20:18.282
Let me see if I got every step right.

20:18.284 --> 20:20.218
Grab and pull.

20:20.220 --> 20:23.454
Shall we call it the modified cave man?

20:27.192 --> 20:29.060
Sorry.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.329
Wait.

20:34.299 --> 20:36.467
Dancing.

22:34.086 --> 22:35.920
Oh.

22:37.256 --> 22:38.989
Morning, sunshine.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.462
You didn't go home with Franck?

22:44.464 --> 22:46.330
Well, I don't normally kiss and tell,

22:46.332 --> 22:49.300
but since we're on topic,
yeah, he came home with <i> me.</i>

22:49.302 --> 22:51.535
Anything else I can learn from him?

22:51.537 --> 22:53.337
Don't be too cool for school.

22:53.339 --> 22:55.740
Be passionate.
That's the new cool.

22:57.275 --> 22:59.210
But Franck's indifferent?

22:59.212 --> 23:01.178
No, Franck's passionate.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.880
About you?

23:02.882 --> 23:04.415
Yeah, he is.

23:04.417 --> 23:07.218
But the question is,
what are <i> you</i> passionate about?

23:08.421 --> 23:09.854
Bubbles?

23:09.856 --> 23:13.090
You didn't want to take the lift?

23:15.427 --> 23:17.228
Are we allowed to be in here?

23:17.230 --> 23:19.597
Shh!

23:22.435 --> 23:25.836
Watch out for the glass.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.821
It's a view.

23:43.823 --> 23:46.157
We're not just here for the view.

23:46.159 --> 23:49.527
I stopped perving
on my neighbors when I was 12.

23:53.031 --> 23:55.633
Come on.

24:01.807 --> 24:04.542
Wow. They better not be bats.

24:04.544 --> 24:07.211
They're birds.

24:07.213 --> 24:09.146
I'm a birder.

24:09.148 --> 24:12.149
It's a stopover on their migration South.

24:12.151 --> 24:13.517
They winter in Mexico.

24:13.519 --> 24:15.019
How luxurious.

24:18.557 --> 24:23.127

24:24.863 --> 24:28.999

Today was so beautiful.

25:43.409 --> 25:45.876
<i>You're</i> beautiful.

25:46.878 --> 25:50.581
As clichéd as a response like that is,

25:50.583 --> 25:53.417
it might actually get you somewhere.

25:53.419 --> 25:55.586
What about birding?

25:55.588 --> 25:57.988
Is that gonna get me in with the ladies?

25:57.990 --> 26:00.991
Why not?
I think it's awesome.

26:03.261 --> 26:05.496
<i>You're</i> awesome.

26:05.498 --> 26:07.798
The shotgun approach?

26:07.800 --> 26:10.367
Hit on every girl you come across?

26:10.369 --> 26:12.570
It's a good strategy.

26:14.340 --> 26:15.573
Yeah.

26:15.575 --> 26:18.008
I'll hit on anything with two legs

26:18.010 --> 26:20.678
so long as it doesn't have a penis.

26:22.582 --> 26:25.382
What about
the one-legged ladies?

26:25.384 --> 26:27.251
Why should I rule them out?

26:27.253 --> 26:32.156
Less chance of treading on
their toes if we go dancing.

26:32.158 --> 26:36.794
Pretty unlikely
they'll kick me when I'm down.

26:37.929 --> 26:40.197
How do you kick with one leg?

26:41.901 --> 26:45.269
I'll hit on anything with at least one leg

26:45.271 --> 26:48.405
so long as it doesn't have a penis.

26:50.042 --> 26:54.278
Don't be so hard on yourself.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.647
It takes time.

26:57.949 --> 27:00.618
Maybe you need a break.

27:00.620 --> 27:03.954
No.

27:03.956 --> 27:07.391
I'm ready to get back on the horse.

27:07.393 --> 27:10.527
A one-legged horse?

27:10.529 --> 27:12.696
What?

27:12.698 --> 27:14.498
Yeah, good luck.

27:14.500 --> 27:17.334
No, that sounds dangerous.

27:22.074 --> 27:23.407
That's not mine.

27:25.077 --> 27:28.178
Could you hand it to the server?

27:34.019 --> 27:35.886
Hello?

27:42.861 --> 27:44.728
- Kirsten?
- Yes.

27:44.730 --> 27:45.929
Hello.

27:45.931 --> 27:48.666
Thank you so much.

27:48.668 --> 27:50.334
Did you leave it here earlier?

27:50.336 --> 27:52.636
Yeah. Yeah. I'm an idiot.
I'm sorry.

27:52.638 --> 27:54.872
I was sitting right here with some friends

27:54.874 --> 27:56.974
just, you know, not even an hour ago.

27:56.976 --> 28:00.110
I've been here almost three hours.

28:00.112 --> 28:03.047
Really?
I... how rude.

28:03.049 --> 28:05.582
I didn't introduce myself.
Astor.

28:05.584 --> 28:09.820
Right. Astor, is that frenchman
over there one of your friends?

28:09.822 --> 28:12.289
That one?

28:12.291 --> 28:14.391
How do you know he's French?

28:14.393 --> 28:15.826
I've never met him before.

28:15.828 --> 28:17.761
I've never... I don't...
who are you talking about?

28:17.763 --> 28:19.697
What is he smiling about?

28:19.699 --> 28:23.067
Oh, he's an idiot.

28:23.069 --> 28:25.202
Tell me if I'm being crazy here,

28:25.204 --> 28:28.405
but is this some sort of
elaborate ruse to meet women?

28:28.407 --> 28:30.774
You think it's elaborate?

28:30.776 --> 28:32.476
Good elaborate, bad elaborate?

28:32.478 --> 28:34.378
- Just... just elaborate.
- Okay.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.780
But look, I've been waiting here alone.

28:36.782 --> 28:38.982
My girlfriend left like 20 minutes ago,

28:38.984 --> 28:41.118
and I thought I was doing a good deed,

28:41.120 --> 28:44.955
but, um, it seems this is just
some pathetic pickup strategy.

28:44.957 --> 28:47.191
Okay. W-w-wait.
W-wait. Wait.

28:47.193 --> 28:49.793
I'm no good at meeting girls, okay?

28:49.795 --> 28:52.229
Women.
I'm no good at meeting women.

28:52.231 --> 28:55.966
Does that mean I'm not worth knowing?

28:55.968 --> 28:58.202
No, I can tell
that you're not worth knowing

28:58.204 --> 29:00.604
by your dishonest theft of my time.

29:02.141 --> 29:03.807
Oh, my God.

29:03.809 --> 29:05.476
What are you doing?

29:15.220 --> 29:21.125
Is there any correlation between
a guy's ability to pick up

29:21.127 --> 29:24.261
and his quality as a partner?

29:28.434 --> 29:29.933
A guy with no confidence

29:29.935 --> 29:32.536
will stay with anyone and endure anything.

29:32.538 --> 29:34.972
If you never learn how to talk to women,

29:34.974 --> 29:37.074
you won't have the power of a choice.

29:37.076 --> 29:40.277
I love a choice cut of meat.

29:44.783 --> 29:48.452
Oh, no. Oh.

29:50.656 --> 29:53.056
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.
No. No. No. No. No. No. No.

29:53.058 --> 29:55.425
Mila's friend is right over there.

29:55.427 --> 29:56.593
Go talk to him.

29:56.595 --> 29:58.929
You have to be friends
with Mila's friends.

29:58.931 --> 30:01.064
No, this guy is awful.

30:01.066 --> 30:02.966
- Go.
- Okay.

30:09.641 --> 30:12.309
Jake. Hey, Jake.

30:12.311 --> 30:13.577
Hey.

30:13.579 --> 30:15.546
Who you here with?

30:15.548 --> 30:17.381
My girlfriend's in the bathroom.

30:17.383 --> 30:19.983
Oh. I didn't know
you had a girlfriend.

30:19.985 --> 30:21.285
New girlfriend.

30:21.287 --> 30:24.888
Oh, cool.
Congratulations.

30:24.890 --> 30:26.557
Hey, babe.

30:26.559 --> 30:28.325
Hi, astor.

30:34.065 --> 30:36.934
Well, you don't waste any time.

30:36.936 --> 30:38.735
- Hey, take it easy, okay?
- No. No. No. No.

30:38.737 --> 30:42.372
She's easy. I suppose you two
just got it on in the toilet?

30:42.374 --> 30:45.075
Did she tell you that's her favorite spot?

30:45.077 --> 30:47.377
You want to step outside?

30:47.379 --> 30:49.446
Yeah, I want... yeah.
Yes, I want to step outside.

30:49.448 --> 30:52.249
I got to, dust off
my knuckle dusters first,

30:52.251 --> 30:54.418
and I'll b...
I'll be waiting for you.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.920
- You're a butthead!
- You're a headbuttee!

30:56.922 --> 30:59.456
What does that even mean?

30:59.458 --> 31:01.291
- Hey.
- Oh.

31:02.494 --> 31:03.727
So silly, astor.

31:03.729 --> 31:06.096
What?

31:06.098 --> 31:08.599
- What happened?
- Is my eye still there?

31:08.601 --> 31:10.667
What? What are you doing here?

31:10.669 --> 31:13.203
- We're with astor.
- My head.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.138
Well, then he can tell you what happened.

31:15.140 --> 31:17.708
I'm not done.
Mila, I forgive you.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.409
Let's just go.
Come on.

31:19.411 --> 31:20.978
He headbutted me in the nostril.

31:20.980 --> 31:23.180
- Come on.
- Oh, come here.

31:23.182 --> 31:24.848
I have an orbital fracture.

31:24.850 --> 31:26.416
- What?
- Aah!

31:26.418 --> 31:28.151
What?

31:29.154 --> 31:30.654
My hand!

31:30.656 --> 31:32.489
Oh!

31:33.726 --> 31:35.826
Oh, this is so embarrassing.

31:35.828 --> 31:37.461
Aah!

31:50.308 --> 31:52.910
Oh, hi.

31:52.912 --> 31:54.878
Well, h... hi.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.080
What are...

31:57.082 --> 31:58.548
I'm I dropped my keys,

31:58.550 --> 32:01.451
so, um, would you mind
helping me look for them?

32:01.453 --> 32:03.787
Sorry, 'cause I was like,
"who is this person?"

32:03.789 --> 32:06.556
Oh, I'm trinity. I'm...
I moved in just off the back.

32:06.558 --> 32:09.159
Oh, you... okay.
I'm astor. I live right here.

32:09.161 --> 32:11.028
- So, we're neighbors.
- Neighbor.

32:11.030 --> 32:13.363
Yeah, and it's my duty, apparently.

32:14.633 --> 32:17.434
Yeah.
Let me see. Right here?

32:17.436 --> 32:19.403
- Yeah, well...
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.305
Is that... is this them?
Yes!

32:21.307 --> 32:23.240
- Right here.
- Perfect. You're my hero.

32:23.242 --> 32:24.675
Here you are. Sorry.

32:24.677 --> 32:26.510
Why are you
pointing them at me?

32:26.512 --> 32:28.979
- Here you go.
- It's caught in the...

32:28.981 --> 32:30.747
okay, I'm just gonna...
stuck on the...

32:30.749 --> 32:32.916
- Ooh, that's gonna hurt.
- Well, you just... you do that.

32:32.918 --> 32:34.718
Okay.
I never pick up keys that way.

32:34.720 --> 32:36.320
I don't know why I did that.

32:36.322 --> 32:39.256
I-I just pick them up normally,
like...

32:39.258 --> 32:42.092
So, what are you thinking?

32:42.094 --> 32:43.660
Yeah.
Well, um, thank you so much.

32:43.662 --> 32:45.662
- Well, it was nice meeting you.
- You, too.

32:45.664 --> 32:49.633
Perhaps, um, I can come over
for a drink sometime.

32:49.635 --> 32:53.303
Or you... you can.
You come over for a drink.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.505
I mean, that's not a command,

32:55.507 --> 33:00.043
but if you want, you have...
you can do whatever you want.

33:00.045 --> 33:02.646
Sure, that would be...
That'd be nice.

33:02.648 --> 33:05.649
Um, well, it was good to meet you, astor.

33:24.970 --> 33:27.170
What are you wearing on your hands?

33:27.172 --> 33:30.073
What? These?
Gets cold in Philadelphia.

33:30.075 --> 33:32.709
You didn't want to try boxing hand wraps?

33:32.711 --> 33:34.411
Hey, I'm feeling triumphant, Cali.

33:34.413 --> 33:36.480
You can try and bring me down.
It ain't gonna work.

33:36.482 --> 33:39.583
Well, power to you,
but can you at least tell me why

33:39.585 --> 33:43.220
you insisted that I come to this
park at this ridiculous hour?

33:43.222 --> 33:45.288
♪ Girls, girls, girls ♪

33:45.290 --> 33:47.758
They grow on trees around here.

33:47.760 --> 33:51.962
You want to hit on girls while
they're exercising in spandex?

33:53.532 --> 33:54.898
Yes, I do.

33:54.900 --> 33:56.333
Feed me a line.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.602
Well, I don't know
how happy they're gonna be

33:58.604 --> 34:00.537
about you interrupting their workout.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.906
All right, fine.
I already thought of one anyway.

34:02.908 --> 34:04.508
- Go on.
- Okay.

34:04.510 --> 34:07.911
I tell them I'm lost...
ask for directions.

34:07.913 --> 34:09.346
Brilliant.

34:09.348 --> 34:12.649
Genius. Well, go for it, then.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.684
I will. See ya.

34:14.686 --> 34:16.319
Good luck.

34:17.955 --> 34:20.090
Excuse me.
Hey, um, are you lost?

34:20.092 --> 34:22.159
I mean, I'm... I'm lost.

34:37.875 --> 34:39.176
Franck?

34:46.551 --> 34:48.784
Oh, my God.

34:52.458 --> 34:55.158
I can tell you that 50% of girls...

34:55.159 --> 34:58.295
and I'm speaking
from a large sample size...

34:58.297 --> 35:01.631
do not know how to give directions.

35:01.633 --> 35:05.268
You... Are a liar.

35:05.270 --> 35:09.973
A charming liar, just like everybody else.

35:09.975 --> 35:12.809
I'll take charming.

35:14.245 --> 35:16.913
Why does everybody lie to me?

35:16.915 --> 35:21.184
I suppose they just
want to get in your pants.

35:21.186 --> 35:23.487
Well, they can have my pants.

35:23.489 --> 35:25.388
I don't want to wear my pants anymore.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.357
Whoa! Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.
No. No. No. No. No.

35:27.359 --> 35:29.092
No. No. No. No.
You can take your pants off.

35:29.094 --> 35:31.428
Just, let's... let me take you
home first, okay? Come on.

35:31.430 --> 35:33.330
Everyone just wants to take me home.

35:33.332 --> 35:35.599
No. No. No.
Well, that's not what I meant.

35:35.601 --> 35:37.667
All right, now... hey, hey, hey.
Keep your pants on.

35:37.669 --> 35:39.002
Put me down!

35:39.004 --> 35:41.705
- No, we're going home.
- No! I don't want to go home!

35:41.707 --> 35:43.073
It's a time-out.

35:43.075 --> 35:44.841
God!

35:44.843 --> 35:47.110
Oh.

35:47.112 --> 35:49.012
Daddy, what are they doing?

35:49.014 --> 35:52.649
Just...

35:52.651 --> 35:54.317
All right.

36:09.233 --> 36:11.668
You okay?

36:21.913 --> 36:23.747
Franck?

36:23.749 --> 36:25.182
It's astor.

36:27.019 --> 36:30.654
Hey.

36:30.656 --> 36:32.789
My head hurts.

36:34.326 --> 36:38.895
Must... must've been
all the, alcohol.

36:40.399 --> 36:42.832
Was I really, really embarrassing?

36:42.834 --> 36:45.235
No. No. No. No. No.

36:45.237 --> 36:47.637
No different than any other child

36:47.639 --> 36:50.607
who doesn't want to wear their pants.

36:52.377 --> 36:55.045
Do you want to head out again tonight?

36:55.047 --> 36:57.013
You sure you're up for it?

36:57.015 --> 36:59.416
Ever heard of hair of the dog?

36:59.418 --> 37:02.485
Yeah, but...

37:03.721 --> 37:07.557
Did something happen with Franck?

37:07.559 --> 37:10.427
He went back to Paris.

37:11.729 --> 37:13.129
When?

37:13.131 --> 37:17.400
Should be in the air
right about now.

37:20.338 --> 37:24.307
He's a dog.
He doesn't deserve you.

37:24.309 --> 37:26.977
Let's just stay in tonight.

37:26.979 --> 37:30.614
Hair of the dog applies
to relationships, too.

37:30.616 --> 37:33.516
More like
hair of the one-legged dog.

37:33.518 --> 37:36.620
I don't get it.

37:38.723 --> 37:40.390
Onelegged dog?

37:40.392 --> 37:43.393
I get the concept.
What's the joke?

37:43.395 --> 37:46.529
I don't know.
I'm just being silly.

37:46.531 --> 37:48.832
Just trying to cheer you up.

37:48.834 --> 37:51.134
Hey. Hey. Hey.

37:51.136 --> 37:52.736
Whoa.

37:54.372 --> 37:56.439
- Oops.
- That was your fault.

37:58.477 --> 38:01.911
I'll be in here.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.855
So, Cali...

38:11.857 --> 38:13.523
Cheers.

38:14.659 --> 38:18.094
I said you could buy me a drink,
not stay and chat, so...

38:18.096 --> 38:20.463
- Serious?
- Yeah.

38:20.465 --> 38:23.700
Sorry, I'm waiting for someone.

38:25.936 --> 38:27.804
Strike one.

38:27.806 --> 38:31.207
She liked it
when I complimented her dress.

38:31.209 --> 38:33.243
In fact, she made her dress.

38:33.245 --> 38:34.577
She told me that

38:34.579 --> 38:36.780
when I tried to tell her
my mom had the same one.

38:36.782 --> 38:37.981
Oh.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.250
Needless to say,
she knew I was pulling a line.

38:40.252 --> 38:41.885
And your recovery?

38:41.887 --> 38:44.254
II didn't have one.
Yeah, I kind of froze up.

38:44.256 --> 38:47.223
Well, next time, try and push
past the awkwardness.

38:50.227 --> 38:53.263
You know, apparently,
people have sex in this pool.

38:53.265 --> 38:55.231
Yeah. It's rancid.

38:55.233 --> 38:58.835
Like, if you stick your head
underwater, you'll get pregnant.

39:00.604 --> 39:02.238
Well, who's next?

39:02.240 --> 39:03.907
That one.

39:06.510 --> 39:08.044
Hi.

39:08.046 --> 39:11.981
Can I just say your heels are fantastic.

39:11.983 --> 39:14.584
- Louis Vuitton.
- Oh. Oh. Of course.

39:14.586 --> 39:17.554
No, no, I am familiar with their work.

39:17.556 --> 39:20.557
I bet you have a huge collection.

39:20.559 --> 39:23.593
I bet <i>you</i> have a <i>huge</i> collection.

39:23.595 --> 39:26.096
Oh, I don't wear high heels.

39:26.098 --> 39:29.232
I'm not talking about heels.

39:29.234 --> 39:31.634
Oh.  Oh.

39:31.636 --> 39:37.207
Oh, yeah, well, in that case,
I have, like...50 pairs.

39:37.209 --> 39:39.476
But I bet you've got more.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.811
What are you getting at?

39:41.813 --> 39:45.415
High... high heels.
I bet you've got more.

39:45.417 --> 39:47.884
I don't know.
I... I guess...

39:47.886 --> 39:51.554
Well, you're short,
so you... The lift, and...

39:51.556 --> 39:53.223
you're an asshole.

39:56.628 --> 39:59.996
I'm not.
I'm no... I'm not, actually.

39:59.998 --> 40:01.664
I...

40:03.367 --> 40:05.635
She's so much stronger than she looks.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.370
Well, you'll get there.

40:07.372 --> 40:10.707
Apparently, you're supposed to
mix a compliment and an insult,

40:10.709 --> 40:12.208
and then they get confused,

40:12.210 --> 40:14.010
and then they're determined
to get your approval.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.245
Apparently?

40:15.247 --> 40:16.880
Well, I've only been explained
the technique.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.381
I haven't actually put it into practice.

40:18.383 --> 40:19.983
You're scaring me.

40:19.985 --> 40:22.986
Okay, well, look, just stay
away from anything personal.

40:22.988 --> 40:24.788
Third time's a charm.

40:24.790 --> 40:27.257
Okay. Okay. All right.
Who's the man? Who's the man?

40:27.259 --> 40:28.625
- Go.
- Who be the player?

40:28.627 --> 40:30.860
Yeah. You... you are.

40:39.137 --> 40:41.871
Aren't you a diamond in the rough?

40:43.541 --> 40:45.909
Are you calling my friends rough?

40:45.911 --> 40:50.513
No. No. No, they...
they are a...

40:50.515 --> 40:53.650
Lovely pair of... Of friends.

40:53.652 --> 40:56.085
Is this guy bothering you, love?

40:56.087 --> 40:59.289
He basically just said
your sisters were rough.

40:59.291 --> 41:01.991
Did he now?
Is that true?

41:01.993 --> 41:04.894
No. I was talking about...
no. Um...

41:04.896 --> 41:07.497
He's been harassing girls all night.

41:07.499 --> 41:08.965
You again?

41:08.967 --> 41:11.267
You know, my foot really hurts.

41:11.269 --> 41:13.603
And no.
I'm just being friendly.

41:13.605 --> 41:16.439
Bit of a player, are we?

41:16.441 --> 41:18.675
No. Definitely not.
Absolutely not.

41:18.677 --> 41:21.411
In fact, you can ask any...
you... ask her. No.

41:21.413 --> 41:25.748
Is my friend astor drunk again?
Let me take him home.

41:25.750 --> 41:28.218
Wait.
You want to take him home?

41:28.220 --> 41:29.686
Yeah.

41:29.688 --> 41:31.654
Are you gonna shag him on your sofa?

41:31.656 --> 41:33.490
That's not necessary.

41:33.492 --> 41:36.025
Oh, yeah? What about this?

41:36.027 --> 41:38.561
Hey!

41:41.398 --> 41:44.400
Oh, my God!

41:44.402 --> 41:46.302
Well, straight to.

41:47.539 --> 41:49.205
What are you doing?

41:49.207 --> 41:50.907
I got in with you.

41:50.909 --> 41:52.976
- It's freezing.
- I know.

41:52.978 --> 41:54.978
How's that, mate?
You like that?

41:54.980 --> 41:56.179
Jerk!

41:56.181 --> 41:58.915
That wasn't necessary,
but it was worth it.

42:03.288 --> 42:06.723

42:17.669 --> 42:22.071
I I'm sure a lot of amazing guys

42:22.073 --> 42:27.477
have been able to meet you
with these techniques, but...

42:29.414 --> 42:31.147
...they're not for me.

42:31.149 --> 42:32.415
I feel like a phony.

42:32.417 --> 42:35.685
No.
You're definitely an original.

42:35.687 --> 42:38.555
Then why am I learning lines?
No more lines.

42:38.557 --> 42:40.924
No more pretending to be someone else.

42:40.926 --> 42:43.726
Okay. Um, well,
you're good at improvising.

42:43.728 --> 42:45.395
We'll work on that.

42:45.397 --> 42:49.432
No. No, I get flustered.
I always say the wrong thing.

42:49.434 --> 42:51.935
I-I-I can't think on my feet.

42:51.937 --> 42:54.370
Hell, I can't even stand on my feet

42:54.372 --> 42:56.973
after that girl stomped on me.

42:58.810 --> 43:01.711
No, I'm... I'm not giving up.

43:01.713 --> 43:05.448
I'm gonna go forward with honesty.

43:05.450 --> 43:08.384
And maybe if a girl gets to know me,

43:08.386 --> 43:10.820
she'll still dump me like Mila,

43:10.822 --> 43:16.593
but... I'm too tired
to be someone else.

43:17.728 --> 43:20.763
I'm sure there's someone
out there for you.

43:20.765 --> 43:23.900
We've been having fun together.

43:25.169 --> 43:26.669
Yeah.

43:26.671 --> 43:28.771
You're heartbroken over Mila.

43:28.773 --> 43:31.474
It's tattooed all over your face.

43:34.212 --> 43:36.679
I like you.

43:36.681 --> 43:39.849
But you <i>love</i> Mila.

43:44.088 --> 43:50.693
No, I think, um, I think you
should go with being yourself.

43:50.695 --> 43:52.395
It'll work.

43:54.598 --> 43:56.933
I hope so.

43:57.901 --> 44:00.703
Should get out of those damp clothes.

44:00.705 --> 44:03.473
Slip into something more comfortable?

44:07.745 --> 44:10.246
I'll see you soon.

44:25.529 --> 44:27.463
Can I sit here?

44:27.465 --> 44:30.199
You look like the kind of girl
I'd like to know,

44:30.201 --> 44:32.635
and if you let me sit here for a minute,

44:32.637 --> 44:35.204
I might be able to find out.

44:36.440 --> 44:39.342
Okay.

44:41.612 --> 44:44.247
I'm... I'll...

44:44.249 --> 44:47.884
Hello.

44:47.886 --> 44:50.319
Did you...
did you say something?

44:50.321 --> 44:53.623
Hello.

44:53.625 --> 44:56.259
Well, hi.

44:56.261 --> 44:59.629
Pleased to meet you.

44:59.631 --> 45:01.164
Yeah. Yeah. Me...

45:03.168 --> 45:05.668
S-so, you've lost your voice?

45:05.670 --> 45:10.039
No. I, um, this is my voice.

45:10.041 --> 45:11.774
Oh.

45:11.776 --> 45:14.310
It's kind of cute.

45:14.312 --> 45:15.511
Thanks.

45:17.015 --> 45:19.549
A hawk.

45:19.551 --> 45:22.852
Red-tailed hawk.
Genus buteo.

45:22.854 --> 45:25.254
Species jamaicensis.

45:25.256 --> 45:28.958
That's right.

45:33.030 --> 45:36.265
She sounds perfect.

45:38.269 --> 45:40.136
I dumped her last night.

45:40.138 --> 45:41.337
What? Why?

45:41.339 --> 45:44.507
She bored me to tears.

45:44.509 --> 45:48.511
You actually cried, didn't you?

45:48.513 --> 45:51.047
I've never had to break up with anyone.

45:51.049 --> 45:52.982
It's kind of difficult.

45:52.984 --> 45:55.885
I sent a 194-character message.

45:55.887 --> 45:58.121
That's two SMS messages.

45:58.123 --> 45:59.689
But I think if you do that,

45:59.691 --> 46:01.591
people think you're making an effort.

46:01.593 --> 46:05.361
Well, I never thought I'd say
it, astor, but you're heartless.

46:05.363 --> 46:06.462
That'd be nice.

46:06.464 --> 46:11.434
A heart does not beat on blood alone.

46:11.436 --> 46:15.772
I wish I could rip my heart out
and be done with it.

46:15.774 --> 46:19.776
Surely, there are
other blood-filled organs

46:19.778 --> 46:23.412
that can pump blood around the body.

46:25.182 --> 46:27.183
I don't know how you can say that

46:27.185 --> 46:29.418
when you just crushed a heart last night.

46:29.420 --> 46:31.954
I cried for her, and I cried for me.

46:31.956 --> 46:33.556
Yeah, but you loved it.

46:33.558 --> 46:35.024
You think I'm indulging?

46:35.026 --> 46:37.026
You ever get bored when you're sad?

46:37.028 --> 46:38.394
- No.
- So admit it.

46:38.396 --> 46:40.429
You find sadness entertaining.
I'm human.

46:40.431 --> 46:43.900
All I'm saying is that emotions
are addictive, good or bad.

46:43.902 --> 46:45.468
Oh, great.
I'm an addict.

46:45.470 --> 46:48.371
You recommend cold Turkey or weaning?

46:48.373 --> 46:52.441
Um, maybe desensitizing.

46:52.443 --> 46:55.845
Come on, man!

46:55.847 --> 46:58.614
How'd you mean it, then?

46:58.616 --> 47:00.616
I hope he makes you happy.

47:00.618 --> 47:04.887
I meant it as I said it.
I wasn't being sarcastic.

47:04.889 --> 47:06.989
Sounds sarcastic to me.

47:06.991 --> 47:10.560
I would never use such a low form of wit.

47:10.562 --> 47:14.096
You're using it now.
He's using it now, isn't he?

47:14.098 --> 47:17.466
Hey! Hey!
I respect you too much for that.

47:17.468 --> 47:19.235
You sarcastic bastard!

47:19.237 --> 47:21.537
Stop playing games, astor.

47:21.539 --> 47:22.738
Okay. Okay.

47:22.740 --> 47:26.275
From the bottom of my heart,

47:26.277 --> 47:31.013
I'm sorry I headbutted you
with my eye socket.

47:31.015 --> 47:33.282
God, I could not hate you more.

47:33.284 --> 47:35.785
- Now who's being sarcastic?
- You butthead!

47:35.787 --> 47:38.120
You love me, don't you?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

47:38.122 --> 47:40.156
Okay. All right. Hey!
Settle down.

47:40.158 --> 47:44.093
And you. What are you doing?

47:44.095 --> 47:47.797
I'm sorry I called you easy.

47:47.799 --> 47:51.133
You're definitely not easy.

47:51.135 --> 47:55.438
I was hurt, and it made me nasty.

48:00.077 --> 48:03.145
- He uses sarcasm.
- Just... you drive.

48:08.785 --> 48:10.753
Hey.

48:10.755 --> 48:14.257
I'll try not to get my finger
stuck in your ring this time.

48:14.259 --> 48:16.292
What?

48:16.294 --> 48:20.396
Your key ring.
Your little... I'm sorry.

48:20.398 --> 48:24.000
That... that did not
come out right... At all.

48:24.002 --> 48:25.234
I'm sorry.

48:25.236 --> 48:27.637
How's your apartment coming along?

48:27.639 --> 48:30.907
Do you spy on all of your neighbors, or...

48:30.909 --> 48:33.843
Only the cute ones.

48:33.845 --> 48:37.513
Let's hope I'm not included in that.

48:37.515 --> 48:39.782
Not anymore.

48:49.793 --> 48:51.560
Hi.

48:51.562 --> 48:52.728
Hi.

48:52.730 --> 48:55.331
You didn't
have to bring these back.

48:55.333 --> 48:57.266
- They're not my size.
- Yeah.

48:57.268 --> 48:59.235
Um, you should go.
Jake's inside.

48:59.237 --> 49:02.438
You should really talk to Cali again.

49:02.440 --> 49:05.508
Why? She's still angry at me.
She's not gonna forgive me.

49:05.510 --> 49:07.944
What's the point of talking to her?

49:07.946 --> 49:09.211
I can be there.

49:09.213 --> 49:11.447
You know, you should just go, astor.

49:11.449 --> 49:12.848
Okay.

49:12.850 --> 49:15.818
Oh, hi.

49:15.820 --> 49:17.153
Yeah.

49:17.155 --> 49:19.522
What's this?

49:19.524 --> 49:21.023
It's just... okay.

49:21.025 --> 49:22.725
You had this?

49:22.727 --> 49:29.265
Well, she left it at my place
by the bed... under it, really.

49:29.267 --> 49:31.701
It was weeks ago, Jake.

49:31.703 --> 49:35.438
The idea that Mila dropped
her drawers in front of you

49:35.440 --> 49:38.174
makes me want to upchuck in my mouth.

49:38.176 --> 49:43.479
Go right ahead.
Just get out of the way.

49:43.481 --> 49:46.048
Jake. Jake! Jake! Jake!
Hey, stop! Jake!

49:46.050 --> 49:48.284
He's strangling me!

49:48.286 --> 49:49.552
Stop!

49:49.554 --> 49:51.354
Astor.

49:51.356 --> 49:53.089
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

49:53.091 --> 49:54.490
Jake? Jake?

49:54.492 --> 49:56.926
What did you do to him?
What did you do?

49:56.928 --> 49:58.761
Jake?

49:58.763 --> 50:00.029
It's a myocardial infarction.

50:00.031 --> 50:01.564
A heart attack?
He's only 28 years old.

50:01.566 --> 50:03.232
No, he's got to go to the hospital.

50:03.234 --> 50:04.567
- I'm okay!
- He's okay.

50:04.569 --> 50:06.235
- Oh!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

50:06.237 --> 50:08.004
Baby. Baby.
Do you have insurance?

50:08.006 --> 50:10.106
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

50:10.108 --> 50:12.575
Chest pains, dysemia, high-stress
individual, probable steroid usage.

50:12.577 --> 50:14.777
A textbook scenario.
Get him out of here!

50:14.779 --> 50:16.078
He needs to see a doctor.

50:16.080 --> 50:17.780
We're doctors.
We can handle this.

50:17.782 --> 50:19.915
You're med students, and your
grades aren't that good.

50:19.917 --> 50:21.517
Just leave, astor.

50:23.354 --> 50:27.289
Okay. We're gonna be okay.
Okay? Just... yeah.

50:27.291 --> 50:30.092
You ready?

50:30.094 --> 50:31.360
Left here?
Yes.

50:31.362 --> 50:33.129
- Left here?
- Yes, right here... left.

50:33.131 --> 50:35.364
I can't believe
there's a hospital around here.

50:35.366 --> 50:37.233
It's a very residential neighborhood.

50:37.235 --> 50:39.502
Oh, my God,
I'm stuck behind a grandmother.

50:39.504 --> 50:41.637
Move! Get out of the way!

50:41.639 --> 50:44.140
He's barely even breathing.
Could you just hurry up?

50:44.142 --> 50:46.208
Do you even know
where you're going, astor?

50:46.210 --> 50:48.077
- No. Not... not really.
- What?!

50:48.079 --> 50:49.645
I mean, I have an idea.
I have a general idea.

50:49.647 --> 50:51.248
- Give me your phone.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

50:51.249 --> 50:52.615
Just take the phone.
He's really not good.

50:52.617 --> 50:54.016
- Take the phone. Look it up.
- What?

50:54.018 --> 50:55.284
Look up where the hospital is.

50:55.286 --> 50:57.186
You probably should've sat up front.

50:57.188 --> 50:58.487
Three Miles ahead. It should be
on your right-hand side.

50:58.489 --> 51:00.056
Are you sure that's the closest?

51:00.058 --> 51:01.657
That's all we ha...
where do you want to go?

51:01.659 --> 51:02.658
Just a free clinic?

51:02.660 --> 51:04.193
God, this guy is just riding me.

51:04.195 --> 51:05.661
Put your brakes on if he's riding you.

51:05.663 --> 51:07.530
Make him crash into you.
I hate people who do that.

51:07.532 --> 51:08.931
Well, we have somewhere to be.

51:12.703 --> 51:15.438
Oh.

51:17.775 --> 51:19.475
Already?

51:19.477 --> 51:20.476
Yeah.

51:20.478 --> 51:23.079
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.

51:28.920 --> 51:30.119
You okay?

51:30.121 --> 51:31.754
Yeah.

51:31.756 --> 51:33.456
Blood flow's back to normal.

51:33.458 --> 51:37.026
I...Might be ready to go again
in a couple minutes.

51:37.028 --> 51:39.528
Have you said thank you to astor yet?

51:39.530 --> 51:41.097
I will.

51:41.099 --> 51:43.666
I'm just not looking forward to it.

51:43.668 --> 51:45.601
Well, he probably saved your life, so...

51:45.603 --> 51:48.204
I know. I know.

51:48.206 --> 51:51.307
He's just gonna be so smug.

51:51.309 --> 51:53.876
Why are you so happy with yourself?

51:53.878 --> 51:56.479
Do I need a reason?

51:58.015 --> 52:00.382
You could've let Mila's boyfriend die.

52:00.384 --> 52:02.718
Then at least she'd be available.

52:02.720 --> 52:03.986
It was a toss up.

52:03.988 --> 52:05.754
Impress her by being the hero

52:05.756 --> 52:08.657
or let the opposition annihilate himself.

52:08.659 --> 52:11.327
Yeah. You probably
made the right choice.

52:12.997 --> 52:15.564
Did you set this up?

52:18.835 --> 52:21.504
I want you to be friends again.

52:21.506 --> 52:22.872
Astor.

52:22.874 --> 52:25.274
Just give it a shot, okay?

52:25.276 --> 52:28.244
Can we just try, Cali?

52:31.615 --> 52:34.283
I guess.

52:40.557 --> 52:41.991
Thank you.

52:43.261 --> 52:45.261
Let's all just promise

52:45.263 --> 52:49.198
that we're gonna be mature
about this, okay?

52:49.200 --> 52:51.200
So...

52:51.202 --> 52:57.273
You walked in on Mila with
William James, is that right?

52:57.275 --> 52:58.774
Not exactly.

52:58.776 --> 53:01.210
So, you didn't see them together,

53:01.212 --> 53:03.846
but you knew that they'd been together.

53:03.848 --> 53:06.882
No. I was there.

53:06.884 --> 53:10.452
Oh, you were hiding?

53:10.454 --> 53:11.587
No.

53:11.589 --> 53:17.927
William James and I
invited Mila to join us.

53:17.929 --> 53:20.796
Where? I mean, I don't...

53:25.202 --> 53:27.303
In your bed?

53:28.605 --> 53:32.341
Like a...
like a... a... ménage à trois?

53:32.343 --> 53:34.310
Like a three...
I'm really sorry.

53:34.312 --> 53:37.780
I wish it'd never happened.

53:37.782 --> 53:41.250
I guess it wasn't really cheating,

53:41.252 --> 53:43.852
but it was enough to end it.

53:43.854 --> 53:45.821
Three years with one guy.

53:45.823 --> 53:49.091
I actually thought I loved him.

53:49.093 --> 53:50.326
How...

53:50.328 --> 53:52.494
Okay, I think...

53:52.496 --> 53:58.467
I think it's important that
we understand how this happened.

53:58.469 --> 54:02.538
How did W.J. instigate this?

54:02.540 --> 54:04.707
Well, he knew Mila and I were close.

54:04.709 --> 54:07.076
He asked me if I'd ever been with a woman,

54:07.078 --> 54:11.080
if I'd ever thought about it,
if Mila and I had ever kissed,

54:11.082 --> 54:12.514
and it grew from there.

54:12.516 --> 54:13.749
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

54:13.751 --> 54:16.185
I just wanted to make him happy.

54:16.187 --> 54:19.121
Oh, you probably did...
I'm guessing.

54:19.123 --> 54:21.357
I don't... I'm gue... you know.

54:21.359 --> 54:23.692
II thought it was something
you both wanted.

54:23.694 --> 54:27.596
I obviously made a huge mistake,
and I'm sorry.

54:29.099 --> 54:31.333
Me, too.

54:37.440 --> 54:39.575
But how did it work?

54:39.577 --> 54:45.281
I mean,
I-I-I-I've had a... Ménage à un.

54:46.851 --> 54:49.652
A lot... a lot of the time.
A lot of times.

54:49.654 --> 54:52.087
But a ménage à trois?

54:52.089 --> 54:56.025
Just more people.

54:59.996 --> 55:03.899
Hey, I thought maybe
it was time for that drink.

55:03.901 --> 55:05.200
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

55:05.202 --> 55:06.969
Come on in.

55:06.971 --> 55:08.904
Yeah. Thanks.

55:11.641 --> 55:14.109
This is a really nice place.

55:14.111 --> 55:15.344
Oh, thank you.

55:15.346 --> 55:17.313
Yes, make yourself at home.

55:19.350 --> 55:22.351
Sure.

55:26.323 --> 55:28.791
So, do you have any lemons for the...

55:29.926 --> 55:32.294
No.

55:32.296 --> 55:34.763
No, I'm sorry.

55:36.166 --> 55:39.902
Straight. It's how I do it.

55:48.244 --> 55:49.445
Cheers.

55:49.447 --> 55:51.013
Cheers.

56:04.495 --> 56:06.729
Just... Hello?

56:06.731 --> 56:08.497
You don't need my advice.

56:08.499 --> 56:12.000
Yes.
I'd like to order a half-dozen.

56:12.002 --> 56:16.238
Astor, if she's there with you,
it means she likes you.

56:16.240 --> 56:20.943
Okay, how do I go about
getting more of the rump steaks?

56:20.945 --> 56:23.145
Put some music on.
Get her dancing.

56:23.147 --> 56:24.847
All right. I'll try those.

56:24.849 --> 56:26.415
Bye.

56:27.817 --> 56:33.489
That was my,
Mail-order meat woman.

56:33.491 --> 56:36.592
I like regular meat.

56:36.594 --> 56:38.994
Always there.

56:38.996 --> 56:40.362
Protein's good.

56:40.364 --> 56:41.797
Yeah.

56:41.799 --> 56:43.932
Yeah.

56:43.934 --> 56:46.268
- Let's put on some music.
- Yes.

56:46.270 --> 56:48.470
You want to put on some music?

57:04.287 --> 57:07.156
Normally, I dance by myself.

57:15.031 --> 57:16.965
Come on, astor. Get up.

57:37.153 --> 57:39.621
You mind?
I think my head's bleeding.

57:39.623 --> 57:40.823
Let me see.

57:40.825 --> 57:42.891
I think it's bleeding.

57:42.893 --> 57:44.293
Yeah. Okay.

57:44.295 --> 57:45.994
Here. All right.

57:45.996 --> 57:47.196
All right.

57:47.198 --> 57:49.998
Oh, I don't see anything.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.134
So, I guess...

58:01.945 --> 58:03.679
Oh.

58:03.681 --> 58:05.113
All right, it's okay.
Oh, yeah.

58:05.115 --> 58:06.949
I got it. I got it. I got it.
No. No. No. No.

58:06.951 --> 58:08.484
It's making it...
making it worse.

58:08.486 --> 58:10.586
Here, let me just...

58:10.588 --> 58:13.021
Voilà.

58:13.023 --> 58:14.923
What?

58:14.925 --> 58:17.526
"You could get any girl
you want."

58:17.528 --> 58:20.195
She said that?

58:20.197 --> 58:23.765
This your meat lady?

58:25.902 --> 58:29.671
I can't believe she said that.

58:31.674 --> 58:34.776
I have to go. I'm sorry.

58:34.778 --> 58:37.679
Can you let yourself out?

58:43.487 --> 58:45.187
Hello?

58:45.189 --> 58:47.389
How do I let her know
that I'm really into her?

58:47.391 --> 58:49.625
She'll be able to tell.

58:49.627 --> 58:52.160
I don't think she does.
I'm gonna tell her.

58:52.162 --> 58:54.963
Are you sure
you're not gonna scare her off?

58:54.965 --> 58:57.332
I mean, does she know
who you really are...

58:57.334 --> 58:59.835
your birding, your loud mouth,
your silliness?

58:59.837 --> 59:03.305
I mean,<i> I</i> love all that, but it
does take some getting used to.

59:03.307 --> 59:04.673
She accepts me for who I am.

59:04.675 --> 59:06.575
Well, if you feel it, you can tell her.

59:06.577 --> 59:09.745
♪ Set my silly little heart on fire ♪

59:11.581 --> 59:14.650
♪ Became my desire ♪

59:14.652 --> 59:16.885
♪ You stood me up ♪

59:18.221 --> 59:20.722
What are you...

59:22.392 --> 59:25.294
Do you think I'm the only girl
that likes you?

59:25.296 --> 59:28.497
What do you mean?
I just rejected a girl.

59:28.499 --> 59:31.166
Oh, so you're feeling confident,

59:31.168 --> 59:33.335
or you want to make Mila jealous.

59:33.337 --> 59:36.638
Am I not successful enough
with women for you, too?

59:36.640 --> 59:38.807
Is that it?

59:38.809 --> 59:41.410
No, you're a romantic.

59:41.412 --> 59:43.946
You want to find the one,

59:43.948 --> 59:48.850
and... Watch movies together
when it's raining,

59:48.852 --> 59:52.187
make breakfast for each other
on Sunday mornings.

59:53.623 --> 59:58.327
It's just, that's not me.

59:58.329 --> 01:00:00.896
It's not what <i> I</i> want.

01:00:00.898 --> 01:00:03.098
♪ You stood me up ♪

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:07.836
♪ You stood me up ♪

01:00:16.512 --> 01:00:17.713
Hi.

01:00:17.715 --> 01:00:20.282
I'm sorry about before.

01:00:22.519 --> 01:00:24.820
Oh!

01:00:24.822 --> 01:00:28.657
Oh, um, I'm sorry.
Did I do something wrong? I did.

01:00:28.659 --> 01:00:30.993
No, but your hairy tongue did, so...

01:00:30.995 --> 01:00:32.694
Should I go and shave it?

01:00:32.696 --> 01:00:34.496
No, just cut it off, maybe.

01:00:34.498 --> 01:00:36.264
And send it to you in the mail.

01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:39.935
Or just swallow it.
Either way.

01:00:48.578 --> 01:00:50.412
Enjoy.

01:00:50.414 --> 01:00:54.850
Mila said you really like
birds, so I brought you here.

01:00:54.852 --> 01:00:56.351
I appreciate it.

01:00:56.353 --> 01:00:59.554
Would've paid extra
for the Turkey if you wanted.

01:00:59.556 --> 01:01:01.356
Poultry's poultry.

01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:04.826
Turkey seems a little bit more festive.

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:07.829
Did you have a cerebral aneurysm

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:09.698
associated with your arrhythmia?

01:01:11.135 --> 01:01:14.836
A period where your brain
goes without blood.

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:16.872
How would I know that?

01:01:16.874 --> 01:01:18.940
There's a test they do.

01:01:18.942 --> 01:01:21.710
Oh, then, definitely don't have that

01:01:21.712 --> 01:01:23.645
'cause they didn't do the test.

01:01:23.647 --> 01:01:27.182
That's good.

01:01:29.053 --> 01:01:34.756
So, um, thank you
for taking me to the hospital,

01:01:34.758 --> 01:01:39.294
and I'm sorry that I was a butthead.

01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:42.164
That's okay.

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:54.776
You're not...

01:01:54.778 --> 01:01:57.879
You're not gonna say
that I wasn't a butthead?

01:01:57.881 --> 01:01:59.981
You <i>were</i> a little bit of a butthead.

01:01:59.983 --> 01:02:02.451
- No. No, I was not.
- Okay.

01:02:02.453 --> 01:02:04.486
No.

01:02:04.488 --> 01:02:06.822
Man, you really don't know
when to back down, do you?

01:02:06.824 --> 01:02:08.323
- And you do?
- Yeah.

01:02:08.325 --> 01:02:11.860
What about now. 
is now the time to back down?

01:02:11.862 --> 01:02:14.196
For me or for you?
I just...

01:02:14.198 --> 01:02:17.065
Neither, man.

01:02:19.068 --> 01:02:21.169
Boom!

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:25.140
Out this way.

01:02:29.712 --> 01:02:33.415
You have anything other than chicken?

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:41.089
Oh.

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:43.825
- Astor.
- What?

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:48.163
Hey.

01:02:48.165 --> 01:02:50.499
- And you are twins.
- Yeah.

01:02:50.501 --> 01:02:52.501
Yeah.

01:02:52.503 --> 01:02:56.104
Trinity, divinity.

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:58.006
Trinity and divinity.

01:02:58.008 --> 01:03:00.776
I suppose you have a sister
named naivete, too.

01:03:00.778 --> 01:03:03.345
Or that's just me.

01:03:03.347 --> 01:03:06.548
- We're twins, not triplets.
- Right. Okay.

01:03:06.550 --> 01:03:11.286
So, it was you
that I was presumptive with.

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:15.123
Yeah. Trinity told me that
she didn't know anyone here.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:17.959
Yeah, I was kind of
keeping you a secret, too.

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:19.828
I just thought you were creepy.

01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:23.031
Sadly, I have that effect on women.

01:03:23.033 --> 01:03:26.802
Well, I think you're pretty charming.

01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:29.437
- Oh. Well.
- And I was, um... I don't know

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:32.908
if you wanted to have dinner
tonight or something?

01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:35.777
Yeah. Yes. Great.

01:03:35.779 --> 01:03:38.647
Let's all three have dinner.

01:03:38.649 --> 01:03:40.982
Yeah. Sure.

01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:46.454
Can I ask you guys a silly question?

01:03:46.456 --> 01:03:48.590
- Sure.
- Sure.

01:03:48.592 --> 01:03:51.560
Have you two ever kissed?

Okay.

01:04:42.044 --> 01:04:44.479
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:04:44.481 --> 01:04:45.680
Hi.

01:04:45.682 --> 01:04:47.315
Yeah...

01:04:49.018 --> 01:04:50.886
Jake and I broke up.

01:04:50.888 --> 01:04:52.954
How did he take it?

01:04:52.956 --> 01:04:55.323
Well, he didn't have a heart attack.

01:04:56.693 --> 01:04:59.194
It was... it was really
wonderful what you did for him.

01:04:59.196 --> 01:05:03.798
Oh, well, I had to put all that
studying to some sort of use.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:06.001
He's really appreciative, and...

01:05:06.003 --> 01:05:10.205
Yeah. Yeah. He bought me
that chicken dinner.

01:05:10.207 --> 01:05:13.875
Can I just come in?

01:05:13.877 --> 01:05:16.978
Can... Can we talk tomorrow?

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:18.813
Are you okay?

01:05:18.815 --> 01:05:20.482
- I'm... Naked.
- Yeah.

01:05:20.484 --> 01:05:22.984
- But otherwise, I'm good.
- Okay.

01:05:22.986 --> 01:05:24.319
Yeah, that's fine.

01:05:24.321 --> 01:05:27.188
Let's just... let's just
catch up tomorrow. Okay.

01:05:28.357 --> 01:05:30.425
Hi. Who are you?

01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:34.829
Who am <i>I?</i> Who are <i>you?</i>

01:05:34.831 --> 01:05:37.732
Who's she?

01:05:37.734 --> 01:05:39.801
Who are <i>they?</i>

01:05:39.803 --> 01:05:42.904
Trinity and divinity.

01:05:42.906 --> 01:05:44.339
Right?

01:05:44.341 --> 01:05:45.607
Yeah.

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:51.479
Okay, guys. Here, let's...

01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:52.681
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

01:05:52.683 --> 01:05:54.516
You all right?

01:05:54.518 --> 01:05:56.584
Bye.

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:05.927
Mila, please.
What?

01:06:05.929 --> 01:06:08.263
- Let's talk.
- Your twins are waiting.

01:06:08.265 --> 01:06:10.131
They don't matter to me.

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:11.700
And that's why you're a slut.

01:06:11.702 --> 01:06:14.436
Those girls and I just kissed.
That's it.

01:06:14.438 --> 01:06:17.439
Do you know how many girls
I've ever slept with?

01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:19.741
With or without
significantly different DNA?

01:06:19.743 --> 01:06:21.977
One is the answer. Just you.

01:06:21.979 --> 01:06:25.146
You were my first,
and you didn't even care.

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:27.949
That's not fair.
You suffocated me.

01:06:27.951 --> 01:06:30.018
I felt like a kitten in a plastic bag.

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:32.020
We had no chance.

01:06:32.022 --> 01:06:35.223
But if you come home with me now,

01:06:35.225 --> 01:06:37.826
we can start again.

01:06:37.828 --> 01:06:41.763
Did you break up with Jake,
or did he break up with you?

01:06:41.765 --> 01:06:43.264
Why does that matter?

01:06:43.266 --> 01:06:46.134
You only want me now
because other girls want me.

01:06:46.136 --> 01:06:48.570
Then go sleep with those other girls.

01:06:48.572 --> 01:06:50.638
I might. I'm single.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.441
That's a pretty big opportunity for me.

01:06:53.443 --> 01:06:58.213
I'm offering you a second chance.

01:06:58.215 --> 01:07:01.683
The timing is not ideal.

01:07:03.753 --> 01:07:05.854
You sleep with those clones,

01:07:05.856 --> 01:07:08.623
and we might not even be friends.

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:34.149
Come on in. Water's fine.

01:07:34.151 --> 01:07:37.118
I bet it is.

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.521
Don't be shy.

01:07:51.434 --> 01:07:53.701
Cali.

01:08:04.014 --> 01:08:06.181
Oh.

01:08:06.183 --> 01:08:09.217
It's too late, Franck.

01:08:13.055 --> 01:08:15.690
What about your girlfriend in Paris?

01:08:15.692 --> 01:08:17.125
Fini.

01:08:17.127 --> 01:08:19.794
I don't believe you.

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:24.899
You never called, and when you left,

01:08:24.901 --> 01:08:26.768
you said you weren't coming back.

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:28.970
I was taken by surprise.

01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:31.206
I had to see you again.

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:32.707
Right.

01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:36.344
Well, you're a phony,
just like the rest of them.

01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:38.813
You're half a man.

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:40.948
Like your friend, astor.

01:08:42.519 --> 01:08:45.653
He's more of a man than you'll ever be.

01:08:45.654 --> 01:08:49.290
In fact, he's about
the only real guy I know.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:52.026
What about George Clooney?
He's a real guy.

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:56.663
Later, Franck.

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:18.586
Cali, I'm birding.

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:21.456
You want to join?

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:30.598
Hi.

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:36.069
It's so great to be birding again.

01:09:36.072 --> 01:09:37.738
I think I'm a convert.

01:09:37.741 --> 01:09:39.541
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:41.542
Isn't this a funny thing to do?

01:09:41.545 --> 01:09:43.611
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.148
Okay. Okay. Okay. All right.

01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:49.617
Have a look in that tree.

01:09:53.721 --> 01:09:55.890
A great horned owl.

01:09:55.892 --> 01:09:57.792
Isn't he majestic?

01:09:57.794 --> 01:10:00.795
Yeah. I love it.

01:10:00.797 --> 01:10:03.998
Yeah. Here.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.234
It's beautiful.

01:10:07.236 --> 01:10:11.339
You're beautiful.

01:10:20.416 --> 01:10:23.718
They all kind of look the same to me.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.086
Not for me.

01:10:25.088 --> 01:10:27.255
Birding's my passion,

01:10:27.257 --> 01:10:29.924
like medicine is for you.

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:31.559
I can't wait to be a doctor,

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:33.661
to be taken seriously for a change.

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:35.496
It won't be Mila or miss Klein.

01:10:35.498 --> 01:10:36.998
It'll be, "yes, Dr. Klein.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.934
Would you like a free upgrade,
Dr. Klein?"

01:10:39.936 --> 01:10:41.603
Yes, I would, thank you.

01:10:41.605 --> 01:10:44.105
"Is there a doctor
in the house?"

01:10:44.107 --> 01:10:45.340
That'll be scary.

01:10:45.342 --> 01:10:48.042
I don't know what I'd do if that happened.

01:10:48.044 --> 01:10:49.711
Wouldn't it be your duty?

01:10:49.713 --> 01:10:52.213
I'm not gonna give
mouth-to-mouth

01:10:52.215 --> 01:10:54.549
to some dirty homeless guy.

01:10:54.551 --> 01:10:58.653
I guess that's beyond the call.

01:11:01.156 --> 01:11:03.524
You're not gonna spend the
whole night flirting, are you?

01:11:03.526 --> 01:11:05.260
- Of course not.
- Just that Cali's told me

01:11:05.262 --> 01:11:07.562
that you've kissed
a lot of girls recently.

01:11:07.564 --> 01:11:09.297
Cali told you that?

01:11:09.299 --> 01:11:10.698
Is it true?

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:12.066
Excuse...

01:11:12.068 --> 01:11:13.534
Busy bee.

01:11:13.536 --> 01:11:17.939
I kissed a couple.

01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:20.141
I mean, two separate people.

01:11:20.143 --> 01:11:22.677
Not a guy and a girl, like...

01:11:22.679 --> 01:11:25.446
Did she tell you that
before we got back together?

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:27.849
I don't know.
Does it matter? Oh, by the way.

01:11:27.851 --> 01:11:30.285
You should probably
have a little more practice

01:11:30.287 --> 01:11:32.086
before you dance in public.

01:11:32.088 --> 01:11:33.788
Boop.

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:37.325
Shall I enroll in some samba classes?

01:11:39.862 --> 01:11:41.763
Hey.

01:11:41.765 --> 01:11:43.131
Hey.

01:11:45.402 --> 01:11:47.869
Jenny!

01:11:47.871 --> 01:11:49.437
Astor!

01:11:49.439 --> 01:11:51.272
Hey.

01:11:51.274 --> 01:11:52.540
Sorry.

01:11:52.542 --> 01:11:54.409
You look awesome.

01:11:54.411 --> 01:11:56.811
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:58.012
Come here.

01:11:58.014 --> 01:12:01.616
Come on. Come on.

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:28.009
Mila!

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:54.769
♪ Dry the tears you've shed ♪

01:12:54.771 --> 01:13:00.274
♪ Shed in the name of love ♪

01:13:00.276 --> 01:13:02.844
Whoo.

01:13:02.846 --> 01:13:05.546
Oh, my God.
Look at this place.

01:13:05.548 --> 01:13:08.216
Astor, stop.
Just... stop.

01:13:08.218 --> 01:13:10.718
Stop.

01:13:15.257 --> 01:13:17.125
We should break up.

01:13:17.127 --> 01:13:19.594
What?

01:13:19.596 --> 01:13:22.597
I don't make you happy.

01:13:22.599 --> 01:13:27.201
Not everyone is happy-go-lucky
all the time, astor.

01:13:27.203 --> 01:13:28.703
- You should be.
- Why?

01:13:28.705 --> 01:13:33.374
The world is not made up
of singing birds and dancing.

01:13:33.376 --> 01:13:39.113
I wish my mom would write "happy
birthday" on my cake in jam.

01:13:39.115 --> 01:13:42.250
I've never seen you eat cake.

01:13:42.252 --> 01:13:44.585
I don't eat cake.

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:46.888
I'm a pretty face.
That's my value.

01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:50.191
You're not just a pretty face.

01:13:50.193 --> 01:13:52.693
You got a good body, too.

01:13:52.695 --> 01:13:55.963
Right.

01:13:56.999 --> 01:14:00.835
So, you've loved me since we were kids

01:14:00.837 --> 01:14:03.805
because I was the prettiest girl you knew?

01:14:03.807 --> 01:14:06.741
I thought you had some heart,

01:14:06.743 --> 01:14:09.110
that maybe you love me for other reasons,

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:12.380
that you would lift me above that.

01:14:12.382 --> 01:14:16.083
You've always been my girl, but...

01:14:16.085 --> 01:14:18.386
But what?

01:14:18.388 --> 01:14:20.388
I...

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:26.527
We're no... we're...

01:14:29.432 --> 01:14:32.066
You're actually breaking up with me.

01:14:36.572 --> 01:14:37.939
That's okay.

01:14:37.941 --> 01:14:40.875
I'm gonna find happiness on my own.

01:14:40.877 --> 01:14:44.812
Besides, it's obvious that you like Cali.

01:14:46.515 --> 01:14:48.149
Oh, come on.

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:51.385
I mean, I saw the way her eyes
lit up when we were birding.

01:14:51.387 --> 01:14:54.255
You guys have been
running around chasing girls,

01:14:54.257 --> 01:14:55.990
trying to get you laid.

01:14:55.992 --> 01:14:58.659
You think women want to be played,

01:14:58.661 --> 01:15:01.629
that we want to be seduced by technique?

01:15:01.631 --> 01:15:06.234
You think you understand women
because you've had a threesome?

01:15:06.236 --> 01:15:07.935
I didn't sleep with them.

01:15:07.937 --> 01:15:10.037
It's awkward when
you can't tell the difference

01:15:10.039 --> 01:15:11.239
between two girls.

01:15:11.241 --> 01:15:13.307
Do you honestly think
Cali's gonna want you

01:15:13.309 --> 01:15:15.843
when you're so desperately
trying to be a male slut?

01:15:15.845 --> 01:15:18.513
Don't use that word.
It discourages free behavior.

01:15:18.515 --> 01:15:20.882
Male? I thought
that was the one word that meant

01:15:20.884 --> 01:15:23.551
you could do whatever you want
and no consequences.

01:15:23.553 --> 01:15:25.386
Actually, I meant "slut."

01:15:25.388 --> 01:15:27.788
It's a dirty word
for "liberated."

01:15:27.790 --> 01:15:30.224
I'm gonna tell you one more thing.

01:15:30.226 --> 01:15:34.095
Girls want a guy that's nice, sure.

01:15:34.097 --> 01:15:36.564
They also want a man.

01:15:36.566 --> 01:15:40.768
Your sweetness is charming, astor.

01:15:40.770 --> 01:15:44.605
But it's not always gonna be enough.

01:15:46.441 --> 01:15:48.910
Sorry for being sweet.

01:15:51.246 --> 01:15:53.314
No, what? No.

01:15:54.751 --> 01:15:58.152

So, you, broke up with Mila.

01:18:55.331 --> 01:18:57.832
Thought you loved her.

01:18:57.834 --> 01:18:59.834
I love her like a sister.

01:19:01.437 --> 01:19:04.805
Well, it's a good thing you
stopped sleeping with her, then.

01:19:05.974 --> 01:19:08.642
Been on any other dates?

01:19:08.644 --> 01:19:12.179
I'm taking a break from all that.

01:19:12.181 --> 01:19:15.883
Well, it's a numbers game, astor.

01:19:15.885 --> 01:19:18.586
You look phased again.

01:19:18.588 --> 01:19:20.020
No.

01:19:20.022 --> 01:19:23.557
I'm just cruising along.

01:19:23.559 --> 01:19:25.893
Take it or leave it.

01:19:25.895 --> 01:19:27.962
Take me or leave me.

01:19:27.964 --> 01:19:32.099
Like an old couch on the sidewalk.

01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:35.469
Some of those couches are pretty comfy.

01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:39.673
And who are you chasing?
Franck?

01:19:39.675 --> 01:19:42.643
No. I opened my eyes.

01:19:42.645 --> 01:19:45.346
You sure about that?

01:19:45.348 --> 01:19:47.548
Are you trying to hit on me again?

01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:48.883
I'm not playing games.

01:19:48.885 --> 01:19:51.185
I told you I liked you, and I meant it.

01:19:51.187 --> 01:19:53.554
- Yeah, I get it.
- No, you don't.

01:19:53.556 --> 01:19:55.723
We had fun together, Cali.

01:19:55.725 --> 01:19:57.324
Running around chasing girls?

01:19:57.326 --> 01:19:59.260
We have fun no matter what we do.

01:19:59.262 --> 01:20:01.295
- Are we having fun now?
- Yes.

01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:06.066
We would be if you would just let me in.

01:20:06.068 --> 01:20:09.136
You make me so happy, Cali.

01:20:09.138 --> 01:20:12.807
And... and... and if you let go
for one second,

01:20:12.809 --> 01:20:15.576
you'd see that I make you happy, too.

01:20:15.578 --> 01:20:19.513
Isn't that why you tease me all the time?

01:20:22.684 --> 01:20:26.420
I don't see how anyone
could resist making fun of you.

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:30.424
I'm yours if you want me, Cali.

01:20:32.694 --> 01:20:35.729
We might just fall in love.

01:20:35.731 --> 01:20:38.098
Yeah.

01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:41.001
And you might just break my heart.

01:20:44.105 --> 01:20:48.242
Could you love me that much
that that would be possible?

01:20:50.545 --> 01:20:52.546
Maybe.

01:20:59.721 --> 01:21:02.523
That would be wonderful.

01:21:32.153 --> 01:21:35.289
Oh, my God.

01:21:35.291 --> 01:21:37.424
Hey.

01:21:37.426 --> 01:21:40.160
Hey! Come back here!

01:21:43.598 --> 01:21:45.532
Whoo!

01:21:45.534 --> 01:21:47.668
Whoa!

01:21:47.670 --> 01:21:48.869
Whoo!

01:21:48.871 --> 01:21:51.038
Oh, my God.
