(MUSIC PLAYING)

00:29.029 --> 00:31.198
I'm here because I made a promise.

00:33.116 --> 00:34.201
You lost someone?

00:35.327 --> 00:37.246
I lost everyone.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.749
And so will you.

00:47.464 --> 00:48.465
Sokovia.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.592
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

00:51.969 --> 00:54.096
ZEMO: My father lived outside the city.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.307
I thought we would be safe there.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.019
My son was excited.

01:01.979 --> 01:04.106
He could see the Iron Man
from the car window.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.360
I told my wife, "Don't worry.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.029
"They're fighting in the city.

01:14.658 --> 01:15.784
"We're miles from harm."

01:22.249 --> 01:23.667
When the dust cleared...

01:25.127 --> 01:28.547
it took me two days
until I found their bodies.

01:31.133 --> 01:32.217
And the Avengers?

01:33.510 --> 01:34.511
They went home.

01:36.555 --> 01:37.556
MAN: Who are you?

01:37.639 --> 01:39.308
My name is Zemo.

01:39.391 --> 01:42.769
-What do you want?
-ZEMO: To see an empire fall.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.354
(T'CHALLA SCREAMS)

01:54.448 --> 01:57.075
MAN: (ON TV) Officials have released
a video of a suspect

01:57.159 --> 01:59.536
who they have identified
as James Buchanan Barnes...

01:59.620 --> 02:00.662
the Winter Soldier.

02:01.705 --> 02:04.416
Tips have been pouring in
since that footage went public.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.376
I should be the one to bring him in.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.628
You'll only make this worse.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.799
(ALL YELLING)

02:19.515 --> 02:20.682
BROUSSARD: Hello, Mr. Barnes.

02:21.350 --> 02:24.144
I've been sent by the United Nations
to evaluate you.

02:24.228 --> 02:25.229
Do you mind if I sit?

02:27.981 --> 02:29.107
What the hell is this?

02:30.234 --> 02:31.985
FRIDAY: As soon as Barnes was captured,

02:32.069 --> 02:35.447
the UN dispatched Doctor Theo Broussard
from Geneva within the hour.

02:35.531 --> 02:36.823
He was met by this man.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.201
BROUSSARD: Why don't we discuss your home?

02:39.284 --> 02:41.995
Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn.

02:42.079 --> 02:45.165
FRIDAY: The fake doctor is actually
Colonel Helmut Zemo.

02:45.249 --> 02:46.667
Sokovian Intelligence.

02:46.750 --> 02:47.876
Your real home.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.137
STARK: (IN ENGLISH) What happened
to the real Broussard?

02:59.221 --> 03:01.682
FRIDAY: He was found dead
in a Berlin hotel room.

03:01.765 --> 03:04.351
Where police also found
a wig and facial prosthesis,

03:04.434 --> 03:08.355
approximating the appearance
of one James Buchanan Barnes.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.898
Someone framed him to find him?

03:12.693 --> 03:13.694
(IN SOKOVIAN)

03:16.196 --> 03:17.698
ROGERS: (IN ENGLISH)
People are dead.

03:17.781 --> 03:18.866
The bombing, the setup...

03:18.949 --> 03:22.119
the doctor did all that
just to get 10 minutes with you.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.997
-Who was he?
-He wanted to know about Siberia.

03:26.665 --> 03:27.666
Where I was kept.

03:29.126 --> 03:32.087
ZEMO: An empire toppled by its enemies
can rise again.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.507
But one which crumbles from within?

03:36.300 --> 03:37.342
That's dead.

03:37.926 --> 03:38.927
STARK: He killed my mom.

03:42.973 --> 03:43.974
Forever.

-Did you know?

03:47.895 --> 03:49.062
(GRUNTS)

03:49.897 --> 03:51.523
To see them rip each other apart.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.818
ZEMO: I knew I couldn't kill them.

03:54.902 --> 03:56.069
(GRUNTS)

03:56.945 --> 04:00.240
ZEMO: But, if I could get them
to kill each other...

04:02.367 --> 04:03.827
I'm sorry about your father.

04:05.621 --> 04:07.247
Vengeance has consumed you.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.836
The living are not done with you, yet.

04:14.671 --> 04:15.756
ROSS: So how does it feel?

04:16.965 --> 04:19.009
To spend all that time,
all that effort...

04:22.346 --> 04:25.974
to see it fail so spectacularly?

04:30.103 --> 04:31.104
Did it?
