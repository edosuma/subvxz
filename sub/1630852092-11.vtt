02:00.720 --> 02:03.122
<i>It's definitely no way to live.</i>

02:07.093 --> 02:10.162

13 to 14 different medications</i>

02:19.272 --> 02:22.174
<i>Being this big is horrible.</i>

02:22.176 --> 02:24.009
<i>Think of your worst pain</i>

02:57.811 --> 03:00.312
It'll just make you feel uneasy.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.816
<i>I don't like to burden
my wife, Nothabo,</i>

03:04.818 --> 03:06.985
<i>to come and help me

03:07.754 --> 03:10.155

plan out, you know?</i>

03:11.024 --> 03:12.824
<i>Whatever I try to do on my own,</i>

03:12.826 --> 03:14.593
<i>I do very carefully.</i>

03:20.500 --> 03:23.435
<i>I usually do what I call
a pre-wash.</i>

03:24.771 --> 03:27.806
<i>I just try
to put soap everywhere</i>

03:27.808 --> 03:30.375
<i>and wash really good
from a sit down position</i>

03:30.643 --> 03:32.177
<i>outside the tub.</i>

03:33.880 --> 03:37.749
<i>And then usually I get
inside the shower to rinse off.</i>

03:37.751 --> 03:39.551
<i>And the reason why
I do it that way</i>

03:39.553 --> 03:43.055
<i>is because I can only stand up
for about five minutes,</i>

03:43.057 --> 03:46.258
<i>and I have slipped
and fallen in the tub before.</i>

03:47.060 --> 03:50.128
<i>So I try to take
as much measures</i>

03:50.130 --> 03:53.198
<i>to prevent a fall
as much as possible</i>

03:53.200 --> 03:55.067
<i>and not to overdo it.</i>

03:57.036 --> 03:59.238
<i>I usually don't shower by myself</i>

03:59.240 --> 04:02.307
<i>unless my wife or my mom
are close enough to hear me.</i>

04:02.309 --> 04:04.376
<i>If I need to call out for help.</i>

04:07.247 --> 04:09.248
<i>After I finish taking a shower</i>

04:09.250 --> 04:11.183
<i>I'm ready to lay back down.</i>

04:11.851 --> 04:13.919
<i>Not necessarily go back to bed</i>

04:13.921 --> 04:15.454
<i>but I have to rest.</i>

04:18.024 --> 04:20.559
<i>You know, just because
to go take a shower</i>

04:20.561 --> 04:23.028
<i>that takes away
all of my energy.</i>

04:24.664 --> 04:28.734
<i>I'm simply just not able
to move like I used to.</i>

04:28.736 --> 04:31.470
<i>Even just getting dressed
and stuff like that.</i>

04:32.338 --> 04:34.473
<i>There's a challenge
on every end.</i>

04:41.180 --> 04:42.881
Hey, you going to make lunch?

04:42.883 --> 04:45.350
Uh-huh. What do you want
to have for lunch?

04:45.352 --> 04:46.952
- Pizza.
- [Musa laughs]

04:46.954 --> 04:48.220
But you know what?

04:48.554 --> 04:51.556
I'm gonna make fish.

04:51.558 --> 04:53.992
- And some rice?
- [Musa] Rice?

04:53.994 --> 04:56.228
I'm not gonna make the rice
like Mommy does,

04:56.230 --> 04:58.163
with butter and stuff.

04:58.165 --> 04:58.997
I'm not gonna do that.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.365
Well, baby, okay.

05:00.367 --> 05:03.101
Well, baby, why don't we put
some of that cheese on there?

05:03.103 --> 05:05.270
- On rice.
- No, no, no, no.

05:07.173 --> 05:09.841
<i>[Ontreon] My relationship
with food is definitely</i>

05:09.843 --> 05:12.311
<i>a very unhealthy relationship.</i>

05:12.845 --> 05:15.047
<i>But with all my health issues</i>

05:15.049 --> 05:17.949
<i>and just the pain
that it takes for me to do</i>

05:17.951 --> 05:20.886
<i>the most basic daily function,</i>

05:20.888 --> 05:24.589
<i>I am always overwhelmed
and highly stressed,</i>

05:24.591 --> 05:27.092
<i>and food is how I process that.</i>

05:27.360 --> 05:28.994
<i>I can comfort myself</i>

05:28.996 --> 05:31.330
<i>from the stress and the exertion</i>

05:31.332 --> 05:34.599
<i>and enjoy a moment
not dealing with all that.</i>

05:35.935 --> 05:38.003
<i>But on bad days
the overwhelmingness</i>

05:38.005 --> 05:39.938
<i>is a bottomless pit.</i>

05:39.940 --> 05:42.040
<i>So I eat and try to forget
about my life</i>

05:42.042 --> 05:44.676
<i>and all the things
that I've been through.</i>

05:44.678 --> 05:47.379
<i>It seems like there's
so many things to forget.</i>

05:48.981 --> 05:51.116
I come from
a single parent home.

05:51.150 --> 05:52.951
<i>I did know my father</i>

05:52.953 --> 05:55.287
<i>but he was still
not in the household.</i>

05:55.289 --> 05:57.756
<i>So I was raised by my mother</i>

05:57.758 --> 05:59.991
<i>and she made sure that</i>

05:59.993 --> 06:01.793
as I child I didn't want
for anything.

06:01.795 --> 06:04.062
<i>And I didn't realize until</i>

06:04.064 --> 06:06.498
<i>my later teenage years,
she struggled.</i>

06:07.100 --> 06:08.633
If Mom had to work two jobs

06:08.635 --> 06:10.268
she would just went
and worked two jobs.

06:10.270 --> 06:13.004
If she had to work three jobs,
well, that's what she did.

06:13.039 --> 06:16.074
<i>My siblings were with our dad.</i>

06:16.076 --> 06:19.845
<i>So I was the only one that was in
the house while Mom was working.</i>

06:19.847 --> 06:21.947
<i>But my grandparents,
at the time,</i>

06:21.949 --> 06:25.016
<i>my grandmother, she was retired,</i>

06:25.018 --> 06:27.219
<i>and so I spent a lot of times
there with her.</i>

06:27.221 --> 06:29.287
And what do we do? We eat.

06:29.289 --> 06:31.156
We play games, but we eat.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.991
We do this, but we eat.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.326
And so food

06:34.328 --> 06:36.561
and good food
was always present.

06:38.765 --> 06:40.932
How many calories is that?

06:40.934 --> 06:44.202
- What you're supposed to eat.
- [both laugh]

06:45.238 --> 06:46.338
You gonna put some honey on it?

06:46.340 --> 06:49.408
Oh. [laughs] Cinnamon.

06:49.842 --> 06:51.543
We was a church going family.

06:51.545 --> 06:55.046
My grandparents and my mother
definitely kept me in church a lot.

06:55.048 --> 06:59.050
<i>Every Sunday we can guarantee
that we was there at church,</i>

06:59.052 --> 07:02.554
<i>and so that was a good thing,
it helped me stay grounded.</i>

07:03.656 --> 07:05.957
Food was just a big thing
in our home.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.960
My mom was a cook,
my aunties are cooks.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.863
<i>We celebrated with eating</i>

07:11.865 --> 07:14.099
<i>everywhere we went,
church meals.</i>

07:14.567 --> 07:15.934
<i>I worked a lot.</i>

07:16.035 --> 07:17.202
<i>He was home a lot.</i>

07:17.204 --> 07:20.038
I worked a lot,
he was at my parent's a lot.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.840
<i>He got everything he wanted</i>

07:21.842 --> 07:23.575
<i>and some he didn't want.</i>

07:23.577 --> 07:26.711
<i>So, yeah, I think
that's what started...</i>

07:26.713 --> 07:28.780
<i>I, I just think
that he was available</i>

07:28.782 --> 07:31.383
to everything he wanted
whenever he wanted it.

07:33.019 --> 07:34.686
[Ontreon]
<i>In elementary school,</i>

07:34.688 --> 07:37.689
<i>I was 20, 30 pounds overweight,</i>

07:37.691 --> 07:40.725
<i>you know, nothing that no one
really noticed.</i>

07:40.727 --> 07:42.961
<i>But it definitely became
more of a issue</i>

07:42.963 --> 07:45.564
in middle school,
around the 7th grade area,

07:45.566 --> 07:47.566
<i>because when I was 12</i>

07:47.568 --> 07:50.569
<i>my grandfather up
and had a stroke and died.</i>

07:50.571 --> 07:53.538
<i>And food definitely became
more of a comfort.</i>

07:53.540 --> 07:55.106
So dealing with
the grief of that

07:55.108 --> 07:58.844
instead of reaching
to other sources

07:58.846 --> 08:00.011
<i>I kind of let all that go.</i>

08:00.013 --> 08:03.782
<i>To try to fill a void
that you can't fill with food.</i>

08:03.784 --> 08:07.285
<i>And so that's when I started really
noticing that was an issue at school.</i>

08:08.721 --> 08:11.823
<i>Then my estranged father died
of a heart attack.</i>

08:11.825 --> 08:14.826
<i>And even though I never spent
any time with him</i>

08:14.828 --> 08:16.561
<i>I was overwhelmed with grief.</i>

08:16.563 --> 08:18.396
The lack of care,

08:18.698 --> 08:20.031
I became present

08:20.099 --> 08:24.002
and then so definitely the
weight added on quickly after that.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.104
Lord, bless this food

08:26.272 --> 08:27.906
let it be nourishing to our
bodies in the name of Jesus.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.207
Bless the hands that made it.

08:29.209 --> 08:31.109
Lord, we thank you
for all that you have done.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.577
In Jesus' name. Amen.

08:32.579 --> 08:33.578
Amen.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.848
<i>[Ontreon] And by the time
I turned 18,</i>

08:36.850 --> 08:39.551
<i>my weight was around 450 pounds.</i>

08:39.553 --> 08:42.988
<i>I ended up dropping out
of college after one semester.</i>

08:42.990 --> 08:46.157
<i>I got a job working
in security at a retail store.</i>

08:46.859 --> 08:48.059
<i>The job paid well.</i>

08:48.061 --> 08:49.661
<i>For seven years</i>

08:49.663 --> 08:52.664
<i>working ten to 14-hour days.</i>

08:52.666 --> 08:55.901
<i>At first my size worked
in my favor.</i>

08:55.903 --> 08:58.737
<i>Being big helped
intimidate customers</i>

08:58.739 --> 09:00.939
<i>who came to steal things.</i>

09:00.941 --> 09:04.142
<i>And that's when I started to
have health issues of my own,</i>

09:04.144 --> 09:07.979
<i>and I got diagnosed
with congestive heart failure.</i>

09:07.981 --> 09:11.550
<i>And then the cardiologist
cut me off as a patient.</i>

09:11.552 --> 09:12.951
<i>And she said that there's</i>

09:12.953 --> 09:14.686
<i>nothing that we can do for you.</i>

09:14.688 --> 09:16.221
<i>I lost my job at the store,</i>

09:16.223 --> 09:18.757
<i>and had a total
mental breakdown.</i>

09:18.759 --> 09:21.126
<i>I ended up becoming suicidal.</i>

09:21.128 --> 09:23.194
<i>And then as I was making plans</i>

09:23.196 --> 09:25.564
<i>to make my ultimate escape</i>

09:25.566 --> 09:27.799
<i>from all the pain and burdens</i>

09:27.801 --> 09:29.334
<i>of my situation,</i>

09:29.336 --> 09:31.670
<i>all of a sudden
there was a inner peace</i>

09:31.672 --> 09:33.438
<i>that I surrendered to.</i>

09:33.440 --> 09:36.875
<i>It was like God was saying,
"I got you."</i>

09:36.877 --> 09:39.210
<i>So the fact that I'm still here</i>

09:39.212 --> 09:42.113
<i>it's only because
of God's grace.</i>

09:44.083 --> 09:46.117
<i>So I made a pact with God</i>

09:46.119 --> 09:48.753
<i>to change my ways around eating.</i>

09:48.755 --> 09:51.256
<i>I found a little odd jobs
here and there</i>

09:51.258 --> 09:53.158
<i>and then I got into driving</i>

09:53.160 --> 09:55.226
<i>for ride share companies.</i>

09:56.929 --> 09:59.197
<i>That was more forgiving
on my body</i>

09:59.199 --> 10:02.100
<i>because I didn't have
to stand all day.</i>

10:02.102 --> 10:04.102
<i>I tried intermittent fasting</i>

10:04.104 --> 10:06.905
<i>and was able to lose
almost 200 pounds</i>

10:06.907 --> 10:08.573
<i>in a short amount of time.</i>

10:10.810 --> 10:13.244
<i>And this is when
I met my wife, Nothabo,</i>

10:13.246 --> 10:14.980
<i>who I call Musa.</i>

10:14.982 --> 10:17.115
Ontreon is my husband.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.250
<i>We met... He was my driver.</i>

10:19.252 --> 10:22.087
<i>I guess it was love
at first sight.</i>

10:22.788 --> 10:24.155
We got married, um...
[chuckles softly]

10:24.157 --> 10:27.058
Within a month we married.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.561
<i>He's been like this
ever since I met him.</i>

10:30.162 --> 10:32.030
<i>But the past two years,</i>

10:32.032 --> 10:33.098
he hasn't changed.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.232
So I'm doubting

10:34.234 --> 10:36.234
<i>if he loses that weight.</i>

10:40.006 --> 10:41.373
<i>[Ontreon] We have been
going strong</i>

10:41.375 --> 10:43.141
<i>over two years.</i>

10:43.143 --> 10:44.643
<i>But at the same time</i>

10:44.645 --> 10:46.878
<i>I began gaining weight</i>

10:46.880 --> 10:49.247
<i>and then it just gradually
kept going up.</i>

10:50.416 --> 10:51.983
You know what
the rice is missing?

10:52.351 --> 10:53.118
Butter?

10:53.120 --> 10:54.986
- You bet ya.
- No.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.422
- I'm not going to be doing that kind of rice.
- [Ontreon laughs]

he was moving around.</i>

11:10.570 --> 11:13.004
<i>I saw that he was willing
to change</i>

11:13.006 --> 11:15.006
<i>and so I gave him</i>

11:15.008 --> 11:16.241
<i>a chance.</i>

11:16.809 --> 11:18.610
But now he wants a family.

11:18.612 --> 11:20.979
I cannot give it to him unless

11:25.551 --> 11:27.118
You done?

11:27.120 --> 11:29.054
- [Ontreon] Thank you, baby doll.
- [Musa] Oh.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.156
It was really actually good.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.490
Compliments to the chef.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.243

to the door.</i>

12:07.193 --> 12:09.761
<i>My wife understands that</i>

12:09.763 --> 12:12.964

with the bad choices of food.

Oh, we should get two of this.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.201

12:16.836 --> 12:17.535
[Musa] No, just one.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.438
[Ontreon] No, you're not.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.307
[Musa] It's good for you, Tron.

12:22.309 --> 12:23.975
[Ontreon] You need
to put that back.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.677

those things for her.</i>

13:22.369 --> 13:25.203

[Musa] Okay.

14:18.023 --> 14:21.025
Um, are you gonna want ketchup
or want a little bit more?

14:21.027 --> 14:22.327
[Ontreon] Of course,
I want ketchup.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.698
Cookies and cream.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.800
[Musa] Ice cream you're gonna
have it after you finish. Why don't--

No, I want to get...
I want to have it now.

14:30.904 --> 14:33.805

<i>But Musa's thing is, "I need

23:47.692 --> 23:50.194
<i>I'm just hoping
that I'm in the 600s.</i>

23:53.064 --> 23:55.299
- Your weight is 702.
- [Ontreon] All right.

23:56.735 --> 23:59.570
<i>Oof, that's a lot.</i>

23:59.572 --> 24:02.039
Okay, we're gonna be
going to Room Five.

24:02.041 --> 24:05.042
Okay. Let me sit down.

24:05.044 --> 24:08.145
[breathless] You gotta
get the... The door, baby.

24:08.513 --> 24:09.713
Oh.

24:12.551 --> 24:14.885
<i>I don't know what
Dr. Now's gonna say to me,</i>

24:14.887 --> 24:16.954
<i>but I'm sure he won't be happy.</i>

24:18.890 --> 24:21.258
- [speaking indistinctly]
- Hmm?

24:21.260 --> 24:22.426
[knock at door]

24:25.664 --> 24:27.097
Hello, how y'all doing?

24:27.099 --> 24:28.432
- Good. How are you?
- Good, and you?

24:28.434 --> 24:29.533
Good.

24:29.935 --> 24:31.769
So, Ontreon,

24:31.771 --> 24:33.204
who's this young lady with you?

24:33.206 --> 24:35.840
Uh, this is, uh...
This is my wife.

24:35.842 --> 24:39.076
- Well, good to meet you both.
- Yeah.

24:39.078 --> 24:42.580
All right, so what brought
you down to Houston?

24:42.582 --> 24:45.115
Um, to... To try to get
help on...

24:45.117 --> 24:47.117
On losing weight that I just...

24:47.119 --> 24:49.186
I'm having too much
of a hard time to even,

24:49.321 --> 24:51.088
uh, get it off.

24:51.556 --> 24:54.091
So, you are right now, uh,

24:54.259 --> 24:55.793
702.

24:55.795 --> 24:59.296
And that is about a BMI

24:59.298 --> 25:01.398
of, um, almost 100, huh?

25:01.600 --> 25:03.000
Yeah. Yeah.

25:03.201 --> 25:07.104
All right, so what seems to be
the issue with your eating habit?

25:08.006 --> 25:09.807
Um, it's...

25:09.809 --> 25:11.842
It's not the best. Um,

25:11.844 --> 25:14.111
I do eat a lot of,
um, uh, fast food

25:14.113 --> 25:15.279
and I eat a lot of sweets.

25:15.281 --> 25:16.413
Those are the two...

25:16.982 --> 25:18.816
Uh, two main things that,

25:18.818 --> 25:22.987
I guess, that... That
keeps me, um, overweight.

25:22.989 --> 25:25.089
You eat a lot of sweets
and fast food?

25:25.091 --> 25:26.156
Yes, yeah.

25:26.158 --> 25:29.026
So if you do that,
you're gonna be 700 pounds.

25:29.028 --> 25:32.196
So what are you willing
to do to change that?

25:33.031 --> 25:35.065
I... [chuckles] I don't...

25:35.067 --> 25:37.234
I don't know. I did make
a promise to, uh...

25:37.236 --> 25:39.036
To my wife that...

25:39.038 --> 25:41.338
[stammers] That I'm gonna
cut out fast foods.

25:41.773 --> 25:43.941
Um, that, um,

25:43.943 --> 25:46.343
pretty much, we're going to...

25:46.345 --> 25:49.880
To do a diet plan
and we're gonna stick to it,

25:49.882 --> 25:52.483
and to eat at home, and...

25:53.251 --> 25:55.753
And that... And I
should see results.

25:55.755 --> 25:57.555
- Let me ask you this.
- [Ontreon] Mmm-hmm.

25:57.557 --> 25:59.590
What is your goal
right now in your life?

26:00.058 --> 26:03.060
My main goal is to...

26:03.062 --> 26:07.064
I started studying, um,
in a school of ministry,

26:07.066 --> 26:10.734
so, at some point,
I do want to, like,

26:10.736 --> 26:13.103
uh, minister, or...

26:13.105 --> 26:15.539
Or a pastor,
or something of that sort.

26:15.541 --> 26:17.241
So I do wanna do that,

26:17.243 --> 26:19.476
because she can't
continue to just...

26:19.478 --> 26:21.579
Just be the only one that's,

26:21.581 --> 26:25.649
you know, working and... And
bringing in as much as she brings in, so...

26:25.651 --> 26:27.084
Okay.

26:27.086 --> 26:30.220
What do you have to say
about all the stuff he told me?

26:30.722 --> 26:32.590
I feel like, uh,

26:32.592 --> 26:34.692
it's not the first time
that I've heard him say

26:34.694 --> 26:37.895
he wants to work,
he wants to provide.

26:37.897 --> 26:39.463
You know, I've heard
him say that for...

26:39.798 --> 26:41.899
For, like...

26:41.901 --> 26:44.935
- two years.
- Well, you know, words mean nothing.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.071
- [Musa] Actions, yes.
- The action speaks very loud.

26:47.073 --> 26:49.540
Are you supporting him
to be healthy

26:49.542 --> 26:52.276
or are you enabling him
to overeat?

26:52.278 --> 26:57.114
Uh, I've tried and, uh, today,
he made a promise to me

26:57.116 --> 26:59.049
that we're gonna follow

26:59.117 --> 27:01.352
a plan, right?

27:01.354 --> 27:04.321
All right, so tell me
what's different today

27:04.323 --> 27:06.890
than last 36 years?

27:06.892 --> 27:08.292
So what are you willing to do

27:08.294 --> 27:10.060
and what are you
gonna do different?

27:11.763 --> 27:12.896
Um,

27:12.898 --> 27:15.032
I don't know. [stammering]

27:15.034 --> 27:18.135
I don't know exactly
what I'm gonna do different,

27:18.137 --> 27:20.170
but I know that there's
something that has to...

27:20.172 --> 27:21.905
Has to change.

27:21.907 --> 27:25.643
Um, I'm gonna have
to give up the... [stammers]

27:25.645 --> 27:28.112
At least the fast foods
and the sweets.

27:28.114 --> 27:31.281
Um, that's something that's
gonna have to take place,

27:31.283 --> 27:33.984
um, and it's, you know...
[stammers] I don't think that

27:33.986 --> 27:36.086
that's gonna fix the problem,

27:36.088 --> 27:39.823
but that's at least... [stammers]
It's gonna be a good start,

27:39.825 --> 27:42.259
but it's not gonna
be easy for me, though.

27:42.261 --> 27:44.628
It's... It's definitely
gonna be a challenge.

27:44.630 --> 27:46.163
[Dr. Now] I agree
with all that,

27:46.165 --> 27:50.167
but the first step is you showing
that you are willing to do what you say,

27:50.169 --> 27:53.904
because it sounds like
you said all this before,

27:53.906 --> 27:57.141
and so far, it seems like
you go in the other direction.

27:57.143 --> 27:58.242
- Mmm-hmm.
- [Dr. Now] Okay?

27:58.244 --> 28:00.210
So to get you started,

28:00.212 --> 28:02.846
I'm gonna give you
1,200-calorie diet

28:02.848 --> 28:05.149
that is high protein, low carb.

28:05.151 --> 28:06.417
I'm gonna walk you through it,

28:06.419 --> 28:09.053
and I want you
to start that immediately.

28:09.055 --> 28:10.220
Yes, sir.

28:10.222 --> 28:13.857
And then I'm gonna also
give you some exercises

28:13.859 --> 28:16.126
to start doing twice a day.

28:16.128 --> 28:17.995
- All right.
- You need to increase your activity,

28:17.997 --> 28:20.531
so you need to do
all those things

28:20.533 --> 28:23.167
and start making
the changes you need now.

28:23.169 --> 28:26.303
- You need to be proactive to change your life.
- I will.

28:26.305 --> 28:29.173
So we're not gonna be able
to do any of that for you.

28:29.175 --> 28:31.842
You are the one
that can do that.

28:31.844 --> 28:33.043
-All right.
-[Dr. Now] You understand that?

28:33.045 --> 28:33.977
- I do.
- [Dr. Now] Okay.

28:33.979 --> 28:36.280
Now let me go get
some stuff for you.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.482
[Ontreon] Okay. [muttering]
Oh, that wasn't so hard.

28:42.253 --> 28:44.021
They're okay.

28:51.329 --> 28:52.463
- Yeah, I know.
- [Musa sniffs]

29:01.172 --> 29:02.506
Yeah, I hear you.

29:03.742 --> 29:07.745
It sounds like Ontreon has
had opportunity to get help

29:07.747 --> 29:09.546
with his weight in the past,

29:09.548 --> 29:12.750
<i>and what's concerning me
is that aside from</i>

29:12.752 --> 29:14.818
<i>a brief period in his 20s,</i>

29:14.820 --> 29:17.221
<i>there hasn't been a time
where he has made</i>

29:17.223 --> 29:18.822
any significant difference

29:18.824 --> 29:20.724
<i>to change his situation.</i>

29:20.726 --> 29:22.593
<i>So I have a big question about</i>

29:22.595 --> 29:24.928
his level of
commitment right now,

29:24.930 --> 29:27.664
<i>because the impression
I'm getting is that</i>

29:27.666 --> 29:30.134
<i>he's here for a magic solution,</i>

29:30.136 --> 29:33.937
and that he's not willing
to put in the work he needs

29:33.939 --> 29:35.506
<i>to turn his life around.</i>

29:38.042 --> 29:39.009
All right.

29:39.011 --> 29:43.247
This is what I want you
to read every night,

29:44.082 --> 29:46.717
so at the end of the day...

29:46.719 --> 29:50.587
If Ontreon is serious about
taking control of his life,

29:50.589 --> 29:54.424
<i>then he needs to show that
to me by losing enough weight</i>

29:54.426 --> 29:57.027
to hit the goal
I'm gonna give to him.

29:57.029 --> 29:59.563
<i>If he does that,
then I will believe</i>

29:59.565 --> 30:01.231
he's ready to do what he says,

30:01.233 --> 30:04.234
<i>and putting in the hard work
to change his life</i>

30:04.236 --> 30:06.703
<i>so we can move ahead with him.</i>

30:06.705 --> 30:09.106
<i>But if he's doing
what he's always done,</i>

30:09.108 --> 30:12.709
<i>hoping someone fixes
his situation for him,</i>

30:12.711 --> 30:16.680
then there'll be nothing we
can do to help him that will last,

30:16.682 --> 30:19.683
<i>and we won't be
moving ahead with him.</i>

30:19.685 --> 30:24.054
So where we go from here
with Ontreon is all up to him.

30:24.056 --> 30:27.024
This is... What it's
saying on top?

30:27.559 --> 30:29.092
"I really don't eat very much--"

30:29.094 --> 30:32.095
All right, and this is
the page you need to read

30:32.097 --> 30:33.864
to understand that
you're eating too much.

30:33.866 --> 30:35.365
- Okay.
- Okay.

30:35.367 --> 30:38.402
- Okay.
- [Dr. Now] And also, I'm gonna give you my book.

30:38.703 --> 30:39.570
Oh, wow.

30:39.572 --> 30:42.105
And it's gonna be
what you need to do.

30:42.107 --> 30:45.809
- Okay.
- If you stick with this diet, then do that.

30:45.811 --> 30:47.878
Being at 700 pounds,

30:47.880 --> 30:50.614
you could easily lose
60 pounds in one month.

30:50.616 --> 30:51.782
[Ontreon] Okay.

30:51.784 --> 30:54.218
[Dr. Now] Okay? But what I'm
gonna give you as a goal

30:54.220 --> 30:57.020
is to lose 80 pounds
in two months.

30:57.022 --> 30:59.957
If you cut the sugary stuff
and all that,

30:59.959 --> 31:02.092
- you can easily lose more than that.
- [Ontreon] Okay.

31:02.094 --> 31:04.928
[Dr. Now] But minimum,
80 pounds in two months,

31:04.930 --> 31:08.665
- and if you do that, then we can work with you.
- Okay.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.367
And if you're not
able to do that,

31:10.369 --> 31:12.269
there's nothing anybody
can do for you.

31:12.804 --> 31:13.804
- Okay.
- Okay?

31:13.806 --> 31:15.105
All right, Ontreon,

31:15.107 --> 31:18.675
so I'm gonna see you in two
months, 80 pounds lighter.

31:18.677 --> 31:20.444
- Okay.
- [Dr. Now] Okay?

31:20.446 --> 31:22.112
- Mmm-hmm.
- So you think you can do that?

31:22.480 --> 31:24.348
I'll do my best.

31:24.350 --> 31:27.951
- All right, if you need anything, give me a call.
- [Ontreon] Okay, I will.

31:27.953 --> 31:29.853
- And thank you so very much.
- [Dr. Now] You're welcome.

31:29.855 --> 31:31.188
Thank you.

31:36.961 --> 31:39.096
- You get the door, baby.
- All righty.

31:41.032 --> 31:43.834
- Let's go.
- Okay.

31:43.836 --> 31:47.337
<i>[Ontreon] I wasn't sure what
to expect from this appointment.</i>

31:47.339 --> 31:50.040
<i>I didn't know if Dr. Now
would even help me.</i>

31:50.042 --> 31:52.142
<i>But now that I met him,</i>

31:52.144 --> 31:55.245
<i>I understand that he just
wants the best for me.</i>

31:55.546 --> 31:58.215
<i>So I can't blame him for that.</i>

31:58.217 --> 32:02.386
<i>But I'm also not sure that I can
do what he's asking me to do.</i>

32:03.087 --> 32:05.055
<i>He made it sound so easy.</i>

32:05.057 --> 32:08.225
<i>But he's dealing with
a lifetime of habit forming.</i>

32:08.726 --> 32:10.827
<i>It's hard to change that.</i>

32:10.829 --> 32:13.830
<i>But I know that my wife
needs me to do this.</i>

32:13.832 --> 32:17.968
<i>I wanna do it, too,
and give it my best try.</i>

32:17.970 --> 32:20.270
<i>And I'm gonna hope and pray
that that's good enough.</i>

32:27.912 --> 32:30.948
[upbeat music playing]

32:39.691 --> 32:43.160
<i>[Ontreon] It's been almost a month
since my appointment with Dr. Now.</i>

32:44.462 --> 32:47.965
<i>So far, it's been a struggle
to do the right thing.</i>

32:47.967 --> 32:52.569
<i>The biggest challenges have
been finding things I still like to eat.</i>

32:52.571 --> 32:55.839
<i>Because I'm already eating
such a small amount,</i>

32:55.841 --> 32:59.743
<i>that what I do eat needs to be
things that I like,</i>

32:59.745 --> 33:02.913
<i>and that I know that
I'm gonna eat.</i>

33:02.915 --> 33:07.584
<i>And so, following the diet
the best way that I can.</i>

33:07.586 --> 33:11.321
<i>And I find that, you know, I
have days where all I do need</i>

33:11.323 --> 33:13.590
<i>is a protein shake</i>

33:13.592 --> 33:16.293
<i>or something like that, and...</i>

33:16.295 --> 33:20.230
<i>My wife has mentioned
that protein shakes</i>

33:20.232 --> 33:21.431
<i>are not on the diet.</i>

33:24.002 --> 33:27.170
<i>But, basically, the way
I'm looking at it is...</i>

33:27.172 --> 33:30.741
<i>That I need to make things
easier for myself right now.</i>

33:30.743 --> 33:33.010
<i>Because it's hard
enough already.</i>

33:54.866 --> 33:59.536
<i>So far, the diet and exercise
program has been going hot and cold.</i>

34:01.239 --> 34:02.973
<i>But I'm still doing my best.</i>

34:02.975 --> 34:04.941
[groans softly]

34:08.880 --> 34:10.747
<i>My wife Musa
has been really helpful</i>

34:10.749 --> 34:12.983
<i>to give me the right things.</i>

34:12.985 --> 34:17.254
<i>Encouraging me and
staying on top of it with me.</i>

34:17.256 --> 34:20.290
<i>She's even been reading
the materials more than I have.</i>

34:21.492 --> 34:23.026
<i>And for the exercising,</i>

34:23.028 --> 34:25.762
<i>I haven't really done
much of that yet.</i>

34:25.764 --> 34:27.864
<i>But today, I'm going to change
all of that.</i>

34:27.866 --> 34:29.866
<i>Because I'm working out
with a friend of mine,</i>

34:29.868 --> 34:31.968
<i>Charles, who is a trainer.</i>

34:35.673 --> 34:38.708
- So we doing the easy day today? Oh, no.
- [laughs]

34:38.710 --> 34:42.145
We got work to do. Let's
go. Turn it off. Let's roll.

34:42.147 --> 34:46.249
See, today we're supposed to go
easy, supposed to be a light day.

34:46.251 --> 34:48.418
-There's no such thing. Let's go.
-[laughs]

34:50.354 --> 34:54.291
<i>I wanted to wait until Charles
was available to do my first workout.</i>

34:54.293 --> 34:56.660
<i>Because I knew he was going
to make it more fun for me.</i>

34:56.662 --> 34:58.395
All right, you're pulling that.

34:58.397 --> 35:02.299
- Charles, let's cut across this grass real quick.
- [laughs]

35:02.301 --> 35:04.601
I'll pave it the whole way
so let's go.

35:05.336 --> 35:07.137
Charles, that's a long way.

35:07.438 --> 35:09.172
Let's go.

35:09.174 --> 35:11.942
<i>[Ontreon] If I didn't have somebody
like Charles to do it with me,</i>

35:11.944 --> 35:14.911
<i>it was gonna make it
a lot harder.</i>

35:14.913 --> 35:17.214
<i>The one thing that I know
that I'm not gonna like about this</i>

35:17.216 --> 35:20.784
<i>is Charles is gonna make me
go longer than I want to.</i>

35:20.786 --> 35:22.853
[Charles] We could
go around the whole lake.

35:22.855 --> 35:25.322
- No, no, no, you crazy. [laughs]
- Okay, okay. I'm just saying.

35:25.324 --> 35:27.457
Hey, that's a good looking
incline. You got one more.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.861
I'm gonna go to this corner.

35:30.863 --> 35:31.895
- Right here.
- Corner?

35:31.897 --> 35:32.762
Yup. So come on.

35:32.764 --> 35:35.265
[panting]

35:39.437 --> 35:40.937
- Don't be so eager to sit.
- [laughs]

35:40.939 --> 35:43.340
- That's the fastest you've moved all morning.
- [coughs]

35:43.342 --> 35:45.075
Huh? All right,
we're gonna need this.

35:45.077 --> 35:46.343
Let me move this out of the way.

35:47.078 --> 35:48.278
All right. So...

35:49.046 --> 35:50.947
Now you gotta sit and work.

35:50.949 --> 35:53.583
All right, so we're taking this
ball, you press it above your head.

35:53.585 --> 35:56.019
All right, here we go.
Keep pressing it straight up.

35:56.021 --> 35:58.588
Here we go. Three, two, one.
Here we go. One.

35:59.357 --> 36:02.225
Slow. Two. Three.

36:03.027 --> 36:05.162
Four. Five.

36:06.063 --> 36:08.064
Six. Seven.

36:09.066 --> 36:11.034
Eight. Nine.

36:11.903 --> 36:13.770
Ten. Nice.

36:13.772 --> 36:16.173
Nice. All right, on your feet,
here we go, we're kicking.

36:16.175 --> 36:18.575
On three, here we go.
Lift, one.

36:20.244 --> 36:21.244
Two.

36:22.079 --> 36:23.079
Three.

36:23.948 --> 36:25.115
Four.

36:25.883 --> 36:28.018
Five. All right, stand up.

36:29.220 --> 36:31.021
I'm not no Samson.

36:31.023 --> 36:33.089
[both laugh]

36:33.091 --> 36:36.526
Come on, Samson. Come
forward. All right, see right here?

36:37.395 --> 36:38.562
So you're gonna press like this.

36:39.463 --> 36:40.463
One.

36:41.365 --> 36:42.465
Two.

36:43.868 --> 36:44.935
Three. That's it.

36:45.970 --> 36:47.003
Four.

36:47.605 --> 36:48.771
Five. All right.

36:49.140 --> 36:50.674
You can come sit down, but
you're not gonna stay down.

36:50.676 --> 36:52.175
You finish practice standing up.

36:53.177 --> 36:54.511
So, yeah,
we're gonna sit and stand.

36:55.146 --> 36:59.115
Three, two, one.
Rock... Stand.

36:59.984 --> 37:01.551
One. All right,
we'll go back down.

37:01.986 --> 37:04.354
That's one.

37:04.356 --> 37:07.157
-That's two. Okay, no hands. [laughing] All right.
-[laughs]

37:07.159 --> 37:08.291
And down.

37:09.827 --> 37:11.027
That's four.

37:11.562 --> 37:12.996
All right, hold that.
That's good.

37:13.364 --> 37:15.899
Three, two, one.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.535
That's up. That's five. All
right, stay right there. Hands up.

37:19.537 --> 37:21.571
Now we're gonna lean
slightly this way.

37:21.573 --> 37:26.042
-[chuckles] -One, two,
three, four, five. Same thing.

37:26.210 --> 37:30.080
One, two, three, four, five.

37:30.082 --> 37:31.514
All right, we're going
back down. Here we go.

37:32.817 --> 37:34.884
Right, let's go.
We can head back.

37:34.886 --> 37:36.853
-Up. Give me this and get up. Here we go. Up!
-Really?

37:36.855 --> 37:38.655
On your feet, let's go.

37:38.657 --> 37:40.590
Or you're gonna owe me
a lap around this lake.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.726
- Uh-uh. No, we ain't can't do no lap.
- Huh?

37:42.728 --> 37:46.029
Three, two, one. Let's rock.

37:46.964 --> 37:49.232
You know, we're schooling
your feet. We walking.

37:49.234 --> 37:52.802
We're gonna leave the belly.
This thing ain't got a chance.

37:52.804 --> 37:54.571
- Let's go. Pick them up.
- [laughs]

37:54.573 --> 37:56.706
- Let's go. Nope.
- Slow.

37:56.708 --> 38:00.043
- And when we get halfway I'm giving you this ball.
- No, no, no, no, no.

38:00.845 --> 38:02.946
<i>[Ontreon] You know,
that wasn't so bad</i>

38:02.948 --> 38:05.615
<i>moving my body all those ways.</i>

38:05.617 --> 38:07.817
<i>When you haven't
worked out in so long,</i>

38:07.819 --> 38:11.154
<i>it helps to remind you
how out of shape you are.</i>

38:11.689 --> 38:13.757
That's it. Come on.

38:13.759 --> 38:16.660
<i>[Ontreon] For me right now,
there's a bit of shame.</i>

38:16.662 --> 38:20.263
<i>Shame and regret that
I let myself get like this.</i>

38:20.265 --> 38:22.599
<i>Because it feels like
I have so far to go.</i>

38:24.201 --> 38:25.935
Not too shabby, sir.

38:27.171 --> 38:28.305
How you feel?

38:28.307 --> 38:32.075
- [panting] - Ha. I
think I've done my part.

38:34.178 --> 38:35.211
Sir, every day.

38:35.213 --> 38:37.747
- [panting]
- Huh?

38:37.749 --> 38:39.983
- I hear you, Charles.
- Huh? Don't try to squeeze my hand!

38:39.985 --> 38:41.751
- [laughs] If I gotta sit down.
- All right.

38:41.753 --> 38:45.822
"If I gotta sit down."
[laughs]

38:45.824 --> 38:48.124
<i>[Ontreon] I guess I'll just
take it one day at a time.</i>

38:48.126 --> 38:50.160
<i>That's all I really can do.</i>

38:52.129 --> 38:53.363
[breathing heavily] Ugh.

38:56.100 --> 38:58.134
[slow instrumental
music playing]

39:02.139 --> 39:04.574
[Musa] How are
you feeling on how you did?

39:04.576 --> 39:08.044
Man, I'm nervous. You know,
he wanted me to lose 60.

39:08.046 --> 39:08.978
[Musa] Oh.

39:09.947 --> 39:12.916
Babe, I don't know
if I came even close.

39:12.918 --> 39:14.584
I don't think I did, you know.

39:14.586 --> 39:17.554
[Musa] You've been
doing the diet.

39:18.589 --> 39:19.823
Yeah.

39:19.825 --> 39:21.858
Yeah, and the other things
we just have to clear up

39:21.860 --> 39:23.960
with them about the shakes.

39:23.962 --> 39:27.230
Because I told you shakes, no.
But you said the books said yes.

39:27.232 --> 39:29.265
It's like we're understanding
it in a different way.

39:29.267 --> 39:30.934
All right.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.235
Yeah, because
at the end of the day

39:32.237 --> 39:34.838
we say different things,
it doesn't help.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.272
[Ontreon] I hear you, baby.

39:41.312 --> 39:43.046
All right, let's go, baby.

39:56.260 --> 39:57.961
Hmm?

40:00.231 --> 40:02.999
So now, not enough of them.

40:04.735 --> 40:06.603
Ontreon?

40:06.605 --> 40:09.506
<i>[Ontreon] Today's the day of
my first follow-up with Dr. Now.</i>

40:10.775 --> 40:14.144
<i>I have to say I'm not looking
forward to stepping on that scale.</i>

40:14.146 --> 40:16.980
- [nurse] All right, you can step on the scale.
- Okay.

40:16.982 --> 40:19.015
<i>[Ontreon] So no matter what
that scale says,</i>

40:19.017 --> 40:22.485
<i>I just pray that Dr. Now
can help me find some hope.</i>

40:25.589 --> 40:28.057
<i>Because I'm not ready
to just give up yet.</i>

40:37.067 --> 40:39.402
[suspenseful music playing]

40:43.574 --> 40:46.242
<i>[Ontreon] We're here at
Dr. Now's for my first follow-up.</i>

40:47.044 --> 40:48.611
<i>And my first
doctor's appointment</i>

40:48.613 --> 40:51.815
<i>I weighed in at 702 pounds.</i>

40:51.817 --> 40:55.418
<i>Dr. Now told me to lose
80 pounds in two months.</i>

40:56.420 --> 41:00.356
<i>So if I did that I would weigh
622 pounds today.</i>

41:07.565 --> 41:10.333
- Your weight is 683.
- [Ontreon] All right.

41:12.102 --> 41:14.070
<i>At least I lost something.</i>

41:14.705 --> 41:17.106
<i>But I guess I saw that coming.</i>

41:17.108 --> 41:19.075
- [laughing] - [nurse]
You can go to Room Five.

41:20.277 --> 41:23.046
Not even close,
but that's okay. [chuckles]

41:27.585 --> 41:29.319
[Musa laughs,
speaking indistinctly]

41:35.593 --> 41:39.562
- [speaking indistinctly] -
We're doing running now, but...

41:39.564 --> 41:41.197
[knocking at door]

41:44.068 --> 41:45.768
Hello, how are we all doing?

41:45.770 --> 41:49.873
- Good. How are you doing?
- Good.

41:49.875 --> 41:53.376
All right, uh, so, Ontreon,
what's going on with you?

41:53.378 --> 41:56.012
Because I see you lost
some weight, but not enough.

41:56.014 --> 41:57.981
So what happened?

41:57.983 --> 42:00.750
I didn't get to meet
necessarily the goal.

42:00.752 --> 42:05.421
Um, so I'm not too happy
about that. But, um...

42:06.457 --> 42:08.525
I think we're headed in--
In the right direction.

42:09.026 --> 42:10.193
Um...

42:10.694 --> 42:12.662
I just gotta do... Do better.

42:12.664 --> 42:16.933
I got a feeling that you're really
sugarcoating what you have done.

42:16.935 --> 42:19.002
All right, I'm...
I don't think you've really,

42:19.004 --> 42:20.770
uh, done much of the diet

42:20.772 --> 42:22.805
except maybe one or two days.

42:22.807 --> 42:25.975
I don't think you really have
done any of this exercise,

42:25.977 --> 42:27.176
maybe five minutes.

42:27.178 --> 42:29.779
So you're not
taking this seriously

42:29.781 --> 42:32.849
and making excuses
not to be healthy

42:32.851 --> 42:36.819
and do the right thing with
your diet and your exercise.

42:36.821 --> 42:40.790
And then, all you did
was you made some changes

42:40.792 --> 42:42.926
but not a lot of changes.

42:42.928 --> 42:46.262
So what changes
do you think you make?

42:47.031 --> 42:48.164
Um...

42:48.166 --> 42:51.134
I've really been trying to,
uh, stick with the, um,

42:51.136 --> 42:55.138
1,200 calorie, um, diet,
um, per day.

42:55.573 --> 42:56.806
Um... [clears throat]

42:56.808 --> 42:58.074
I know that we...
Me and my wife,

42:58.076 --> 43:00.910
we discussed about
protein shakes.

43:00.912 --> 43:03.880
And I know that I've been
drinking some protein shakes.

43:03.882 --> 43:07.984
And she's been on to me about that
because she said they wouldn't... I'm not--

43:07.986 --> 43:10.286
What do you mean? You're
drinking protein shakes?

43:11.288 --> 43:12.355
Yes.

43:12.690 --> 43:14.657
Okay.

43:14.659 --> 43:17.694
You have eaten the food that
belongs to the next five years.

43:17.696 --> 43:20.063
How in the world
do you need a protein shake?

43:20.065 --> 43:23.132
What do you need
to take a protein shake for?

43:24.735 --> 43:26.336
Who gave you that idea?

43:28.939 --> 43:31.407
I don't know. I just...
I just... I don't know.

43:32.076 --> 43:33.943
Well, I though it was because,
you know,

43:33.945 --> 43:36.179
- I was low on calories-- - What
do you mean you don't know?

43:36.181 --> 43:38.748
We gave you stuff to read
and that said that

43:38.750 --> 43:40.984
no supplements, no shakes.

43:40.986 --> 43:43.186
Tell me, did you read
the stuff I gave you?

43:43.188 --> 43:45.922
Uh, I did read...
I did read some of it.

43:45.924 --> 43:47.991
Um, I haven't--
I haven't read it all.

43:47.993 --> 43:52.862
Well, you have to understand
what to do, what not to do.

43:52.864 --> 43:55.098
So I'm not going to ask you
any questions. Let me ask her.

43:55.100 --> 43:56.833
[chuckles]

43:56.835 --> 44:00.436
Do you think Ontreon was doing
he was supposed to be doing

44:00.438 --> 44:02.171
and sticking to the diet?

44:02.173 --> 44:05.975
Um... Like, the first day
he was doing good.

44:05.977 --> 44:08.945
Like, the first three days?

44:08.947 --> 44:12.081
And then
he started having the shakes.

44:12.083 --> 44:14.951
Then I told him it says in
the book, don't take them.

44:14.953 --> 44:18.788
And then he said, "No.
I used to take them before."

44:18.790 --> 44:21.391
I'm like, "You know,
before, you did take them,

44:21.393 --> 44:24.193
whatever, but the diet says
no shakes.

44:24.795 --> 44:26.062
No shakes at all."

44:26.064 --> 44:31.801
But he made up an argument.
I just left him to be.

44:31.803 --> 44:35.838
And then the other day,
he was eating peanut butter.

44:35.840 --> 44:37.640
He said it's there
in the book that

44:37.642 --> 44:38.675
he must eat peanut butter.

44:38.677 --> 44:41.144
I said, "I read it.
It doesn't say that."

44:41.146 --> 44:44.847
And then we started arguing
about that so I was like, "Okay.

44:44.849 --> 44:48.251
I'm just gonna leave it until
we go back to the doctor

44:48.253 --> 44:49.886
so he can explain to you.

44:49.888 --> 44:51.154
Because it's not there."

44:51.156 --> 44:54.791
Like it... It feels like
maybe the food is the same.

44:54.793 --> 44:56.993
I told him,
"If you go through the book,

44:56.995 --> 44:59.328
and look at the... The food,
it's not the same.

44:59.330 --> 45:00.830
It's different kinds.

45:00.832 --> 45:02.799
Just because you don't like it.

45:02.801 --> 45:05.835
But it's good for you.
Just take it.

45:05.837 --> 45:08.571
Because if you're full, you're not
gonna think of taking peanut butter."

45:08.939 --> 45:10.106
That's what I told him.

45:10.374 --> 45:13.276
So we waiting to come back
so that you'd tell him that

45:13.278 --> 45:17.180
that shakes is a no-no,
peanut butter is a no-no.

45:18.582 --> 45:20.783
So not only
he doesn't listen to me,

45:20.785 --> 45:23.052
he doesn't listen to you either.

45:23.054 --> 45:25.988
No, I wouldn't say... I-- I
wouldn't say that because I...

45:26.990 --> 45:29.592
I... I do listen. I do listen.

45:29.594 --> 45:31.060
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

45:31.062 --> 45:34.964
You listen but you don't care
about it, you don't do anything.

45:34.966 --> 45:38.000
That sounds so horrible.
[laughs] Like...

45:38.002 --> 45:40.403
Like it just sounds horrible
and then it's...

45:40.938 --> 45:43.139
Like...

45:43.141 --> 45:47.243
Uh, I understand, 'cause
it... Textbook, that-- That's...

45:47.245 --> 45:49.812
That's exactly what
I'm doing, but...

45:49.814 --> 45:52.482
At the same time, it's...
That's not my intention.

45:52.950 --> 45:55.084
That's not my intention.

45:55.086 --> 45:57.887
Well, you're diabetic,
you have high blood pressure,

45:57.889 --> 45:59.889
you are grossly overweight,

45:59.891 --> 46:02.291
and you're killing yourself
with the food.

46:02.293 --> 46:05.728
And we give you some
instruction to read every night,

46:05.730 --> 46:07.964
and follow those instructions.

46:07.966 --> 46:11.000
But you decided to do
whatever you want.

46:11.002 --> 46:14.971
But you don't have time to
play around and, um, do this.

46:14.973 --> 46:17.707
Because when you are 700 pounds,

46:17.709 --> 46:20.643
all that pressure on
your heart and your lung,

46:20.645 --> 46:24.147
it is only a matter of time
before they give out.

46:24.149 --> 46:29.252
I have a lot of concern
with, uh, your heart

46:29.254 --> 46:32.288
and, uh, number of medication
you're taking

46:32.290 --> 46:34.824
with the blood sugar
and so forth.

46:34.826 --> 46:39.028
Um, you know, you're not
a healthy person,

46:39.030 --> 46:42.198
and this is a very dangerous
situation you are in,

46:42.200 --> 46:45.001
and you need to try harder.

46:45.003 --> 46:47.203
Get your weight down
before it's too late.

46:47.205 --> 46:50.940
And I'm gonna give you another
two months to lose 80 pounds.

46:50.942 --> 46:53.943
But you can't keep making
excuses for yourself,

46:53.945 --> 46:56.879
and wasting more time
and coming back

46:56.881 --> 46:58.815
and saying
I should have done better

46:58.817 --> 47:01.184
because you can't afford
to do that.

47:01.186 --> 47:03.686
God knows if you're gonna
survive four months.

47:03.688 --> 47:05.054
Okay?

47:05.056 --> 47:09.025
This is, uh, something,
even if you get a common cold

47:09.027 --> 47:13.262
or if you, uh, slip
and, uh, twist your ankle.

47:13.264 --> 47:14.964
Uh, you gonna be bedridden

47:14.966 --> 47:18.935
and then this is gonna be
all over for you so...

47:18.937 --> 47:22.839
And this is something
that you gonna have to be

47:22.841 --> 47:25.041
the one to follow
the instruction

47:25.043 --> 47:27.877
and do the right thing
for your own good

47:27.879 --> 47:29.846
to save your life.

47:29.848 --> 47:31.314
If you don't
wanna save your life,

47:31.316 --> 47:33.416
killing yourself for the food,

47:33.418 --> 47:34.550
then go ahead.

47:35.252 --> 47:37.253
Uh, you know, eat peanut butter,

47:37.255 --> 47:38.955
take your protein shake,

47:38.957 --> 47:40.723
and think
that you're doing good.

47:40.725 --> 47:42.825
But if you want
to save your life,

47:42.827 --> 47:44.827
you need
to take this seriously now.

47:44.829 --> 47:46.495
- You got that?
- [Ontreon] Yes.

47:46.497 --> 47:48.965
[Dr. Now] Okay, let's see
how we're doing in two months.

47:48.967 --> 47:51.934
In the meantime, if you have
any questions about the diet,

47:51.936 --> 47:54.237
about your medication,
give me a call.

47:54.239 --> 47:55.905
I will.

47:55.907 --> 47:57.907
All right, I'll see you
in two months.

47:57.909 --> 47:59.842
Okay, thank you so much,
Dr. Now.

47:59.844 --> 48:01.444
- All right, will see you then.
- [Musa] Thank you.

48:09.786 --> 48:11.020
[indistinct whisper]

48:12.890 --> 48:15.157
Right, it wasn't,
it wasn't so bad.

48:15.159 --> 48:17.260
He didn't come
and stab me and cut me up.

48:17.262 --> 48:19.128
Who was right? I was right.

48:19.563 --> 48:20.696
Mmm-hmm.

48:20.698 --> 48:24.800
At this point, I am very
concerned about Ontreon

48:24.802 --> 48:28.804
<i>because he's not showing he
has any real willingness to change.</i>

48:28.806 --> 48:31.073
<i>The only positive
I'm seeing right now</i>

48:31.075 --> 48:35.177
<i>is that his wife, Musa,
is not an enabler.</i>

48:35.179 --> 48:39.282
<i>She wants to support him to make
healthy choices and improve his life.</i>

48:39.284 --> 48:43.386
The problem is, Ontreon wants
someone else to do the work for him,

48:43.388 --> 48:46.789
<i>and he stopped listening
to anyone's guidance,</i>

48:46.791 --> 48:48.591
<i>and that's a big issue.</i>

48:48.593 --> 48:50.726
<i>Because when someone
asks for help</i>

48:50.728 --> 48:51.861
and gets that help,

48:51.863 --> 48:53.930
<i>and then decide to continue</i>

48:53.932 --> 48:56.699
<i>on the self-destructive path
they are on,</i>

48:56.701 --> 48:58.701
<i>it means that they want
to create</i>

48:58.703 --> 49:00.937
<i>the illusion
they are willing to change,</i>

49:00.939 --> 49:04.040
<i>but with no intent
to actually put action</i>

49:04.042 --> 49:05.274
<i>to what they are saying.</i>

49:05.276 --> 49:09.178
<i>And my concern is that is what
Ontreon is doing</i>

49:09.180 --> 49:12.048
because he has
only made minor changes

49:12.050 --> 49:13.816
<i>to pretend like he's trying.</i>

49:13.818 --> 49:17.186
<i>And the reality is that
he's waiting for someone</i>

49:17.188 --> 49:19.255
<i>to fix the situation for him.</i>

49:19.257 --> 49:21.290
And that's not gonna happen.

49:22.793 --> 49:24.327
[Musa exclaims]

49:24.329 --> 49:26.228
It's not cold outside.

49:26.230 --> 49:27.330
Huh, it's humid.

49:29.333 --> 49:30.266
Muggy.

49:30.268 --> 49:31.133
[Musa] Do you have the key?

49:31.135 --> 49:33.235
<i>[Ontreon] It went interesting.</i>

49:33.237 --> 49:36.205
<i>I wanna say that it went
kind of like how I suspected,</i>

49:36.207 --> 49:38.074
<i>but he was on me.</i>

49:38.976 --> 49:40.710
<i>It was what I needed to hear.</i>

49:40.712 --> 49:42.645
<i>In the end, you know,
he read my cards, too,</i>

49:42.647 --> 49:44.981
<i>he was like, you know, I
haven't been reading the book</i>

49:44.983 --> 49:47.984
<i>which I, technically, really
haven't been reading it.</i>

49:47.986 --> 49:49.986
<i>Skimmed through it
but I rarely read it.</i>

49:49.988 --> 49:51.187
<i>So there's a lot
of little things</i>

49:51.189 --> 49:53.222
<i>that throughout, he was just...</i>

49:53.924 --> 49:55.691
<i>It's healing, he was right.</i>

49:55.693 --> 49:57.093
<i>I know what he's saying</i>

49:57.095 --> 50:01.197
<i>and I know exactly what
he's talking about, like, 100%.</i>

50:01.199 --> 50:04.100
<i>It's kind of where you're
on that fence of,</i>

50:04.102 --> 50:06.969
<i>should I take hope today
or should I not?</i>

50:14.177 --> 50:16.379
[guitar music playing]

50:21.385 --> 50:22.585
[Charles] You got it, sir.

50:22.587 --> 50:24.053
You're in trouble.

50:24.055 --> 50:25.221
[Ontreon] That, that's
why I call you.

50:25.223 --> 50:26.322
[Charles laugh]

50:26.324 --> 50:27.957
[Ontreon] How are you
doing, dude?

50:27.959 --> 50:29.158
Doing good. How are you?

50:29.160 --> 50:30.192
[Ontreon] Doing good.

50:30.194 --> 50:31.560
We got work to do today.

50:31.562 --> 50:33.329
- Yeah, I know.
- Let's go.

50:33.331 --> 50:34.663
[Ontreon] Uh-huh.

50:34.665 --> 50:37.433
- Can't you let me?
- [Charles] No, sir, it's too late. Let's go.

50:37.435 --> 50:38.968
Let's go. I got weights in
the car. I'm gonna grab that.

50:38.970 --> 50:40.336
- [Ontreon] Weights?
- Yep.

50:40.338 --> 50:42.238
- Got one up here.
- See how you're doing so much.

50:42.572 --> 50:43.772
Try to not be mad.

50:43.774 --> 50:47.243
My tennis shoes and all
that stuff is in the storage.

50:47.245 --> 50:49.245
[Charles] Oh, wow. So,
you're gonna do this barefoot?

50:49.247 --> 50:50.880
[Ontreon] Yeah, pretty much.
I have to.

50:50.882 --> 50:52.148
[Charles] Okay, no 5K today.

50:52.150 --> 50:54.150
- No, maybe not tomorrow, either...
- [Charles] Okay.

50:54.152 --> 50:56.886
- but, hey.
- [Charles] All right, let's go.

50:56.888 --> 50:58.521
Let's see what you got.
Come on.

50:59.823 --> 51:02.792
<i>[Ontreon] It's been two weeks
since I saw Dr. Now.</i>

51:02.794 --> 51:05.061
<i>And my focus has been
on doing better this time.</i>

51:05.063 --> 51:06.395
[Charles] That is good.

51:06.397 --> 51:08.998
<i>[Ontreon] I've been especially
focused on my workouts</i>

51:09.000 --> 51:11.400
<i>and getting back
on the wagon with that.</i>

51:12.102 --> 51:15.271
<i>And ministry school graduation
is next month,</i>

51:15.273 --> 51:18.374
<i>so it's important to me
that I get to that in person,</i>

51:18.376 --> 51:20.076
<i>and that I can walk around</i>

51:20.078 --> 51:23.679
<i>and not lose all my energy
or have a breakdown.</i>

51:23.681 --> 51:26.649
<i>Because that would be worst
than embarrassing.</i>

51:26.651 --> 51:29.885
<i>And not to mention,
it won't go well</i>

51:29.887 --> 51:31.954
<i>for my future career
as a preacher,</i>

51:31.956 --> 51:34.356
<i>if I can't even keep my feet.</i>

51:35.725 --> 51:39.028
<i>So, I want to start my
new life by hitting that goal.</i>

51:39.030 --> 51:43.966
<i>And that's motivating me
to get back to the exercises.</i>

51:43.968 --> 51:45.534
Today, this is gonna be
your little runway.

51:46.002 --> 51:47.069
You strut your stuff.

51:47.071 --> 51:48.404
So you're going
from here to there.

51:48.406 --> 51:51.707
We're gonna be going back
and forth, but you're curling.

51:51.709 --> 51:55.277
<i>[Ontreon] And it's helping me to
keep my focus with my workouts.</i>

51:56.046 --> 51:57.580
<i>I'm planning on sticking
to those</i>

51:57.582 --> 51:59.949
<i>until I know that my stamina
is up enough.</i>

51:59.951 --> 52:01.817
<i>So, I'm working
hard towards my goal.</i>

52:01.819 --> 52:05.321
<i>Not just for Dr. Now
but for myself.</i>

52:05.323 --> 52:09.959
<i>To be able to handle going to my
graduation ceremony next month.</i>

52:15.999 --> 52:17.366
All right. Coming back.

52:25.876 --> 52:27.243
Are we on the--
We're doing good.

52:28.979 --> 52:30.579
All right, give me those.

52:30.581 --> 52:32.114
All right, I gotta throw these
in there.

52:32.116 --> 52:34.083
I brought two friends today.

52:34.085 --> 52:35.584
You're already
trying to kill me.

52:35.586 --> 52:37.219
[Charles] Yep, take a break.
A small break.

52:41.691 --> 52:43.926
<i>[Ontreon] But I'm also
doing the diet.</i>

52:43.928 --> 52:45.294
<i>I'm not drinking protein shakes</i>

52:45.296 --> 52:47.029
<i>or eating peanut butter.</i>

52:47.031 --> 52:49.031
<i>And I'm listening to Musa.</i>

53:00.343 --> 53:01.844
[Musa] Time for dinner.

53:01.846 --> 53:03.779
[Musa chuckles]

53:03.781 --> 53:05.147
Are you gonna come help me?

53:05.149 --> 53:07.650
[Ontreon] Mmm-mmm, you got it.

53:07.652 --> 53:09.118
All right.

53:10.887 --> 53:13.622
<i>Ontreon like,
if he tried for one day</i>

53:13.624 --> 53:14.924
<i>and then he gives up.</i>

53:14.926 --> 53:17.326
<i>And says, "No, I'm going
to do it tomorrow."</i>

53:17.328 --> 53:19.728
<i>And then tomorrow is
the same story.</i>

53:19.730 --> 53:21.730
<i>We never stick to a diet.</i>

53:21.732 --> 53:25.067
<i>So, I am gonna do
everything I can to help him.</i>

53:25.069 --> 53:27.870
<i>But I told him, like,
"I cannot waste my time</i>

53:27.872 --> 53:29.438
<i>helping you to lose weight.</i>

53:29.440 --> 53:32.007
<i>It's either you do it
or you don't want to do it."</i>

53:35.278 --> 53:36.779
[Ontreon] I don't want it.

53:36.781 --> 53:38.013
Okay.

53:39.382 --> 53:40.549
[Ontreon]
That's all right now.

53:44.821 --> 53:45.988
How is it?

53:45.990 --> 53:46.789
You trying to kill me?

53:46.791 --> 53:47.990
[laughs]

53:47.992 --> 53:49.291
[Ontreon] You are
getting so bad.

53:49.293 --> 53:51.260
[Musa] It's not bad. Come on.

53:51.262 --> 53:53.028
This is flavorless.

53:53.563 --> 53:54.830
Okay.

53:54.832 --> 53:56.532
But it's good for you,
at the end of the day.

53:57.300 --> 53:58.467
- [Ontreon] Mmm-hmm.
- Hmm.

53:59.936 --> 54:01.170
[laughs]

54:05.242 --> 54:07.009
- [Musa] Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm.

54:07.011 --> 54:08.310
[Musa laughs]

54:11.014 --> 54:13.249
[slow instrumental
music playing]

54:22.459 --> 54:24.593
<i>[Ontreon] Today is the day
of my graduation.</i>

54:25.829 --> 54:28.731
<i>I've been using this night
as a motivator.</i>

54:28.733 --> 54:31.567
<i>And the thought of being
in front of other people</i>

54:31.569 --> 54:34.336
<i>and how bad it will feel
if I couldn't stand</i>

54:34.338 --> 54:36.839
<i>or couldn't walk like I need.</i>

54:36.841 --> 54:39.108
<i>So, I've been imagining that,</i>

54:39.110 --> 54:41.910
<i>and it's been helping me
to try harder,</i>

54:41.912 --> 54:45.047
<i>to eat better
and work out harder.</i>

54:51.388 --> 54:53.255
[knocking on door]

54:53.790 --> 54:54.990
Come on in.

54:58.028 --> 54:59.561
- Doing all right?
- Yeah, I'm doing good.

54:59.563 --> 55:00.829
Mmm-hmm.

55:00.831 --> 55:01.797
- You ready?
- No.

55:01.799 --> 55:03.532
[both chuckle]

55:05.135 --> 55:08.037
[Ontreon] Don't laugh at me
because it isn't closed all the way.

55:08.772 --> 55:10.339
No.

55:10.341 --> 55:12.174
[Ontreon] I had to remove
the little white collar to show.

55:12.176 --> 55:14.109
[Ontreon laughs]

55:19.983 --> 55:21.417
- Need some help?
- [Ontreon] No, I got it.

55:22.952 --> 55:24.053
[John whispers] A pastor.

55:24.988 --> 55:26.088
Looks good.

55:28.158 --> 55:29.291
All right.

55:29.926 --> 55:31.160
Babe?

55:31.328 --> 55:33.262
[Musa] Yep, you ready?

55:33.264 --> 55:34.897
Yeah, I'm ready,
I'm going to be.

55:34.899 --> 55:36.432
Okay, let's go.

55:36.434 --> 55:37.833
- [Ontreon] How do I look?
- Oh, yeah.

55:37.835 --> 55:39.768
You look like a real pastor.

55:39.770 --> 55:42.705
I know. That's what
John just said, too, baby.

55:42.707 --> 55:46.075
Pastor, damn, I don't know
what I did right there.

55:46.077 --> 55:48.977
- [Musa] Hmm, running late.
- [Ontreon] Yeah.

All right, well, it is good thing
she's not here to see your result

1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:19.101
because instead of losing
80 pounds in two months,

1:02:19.103 --> 1:02:21.002
you gained six pounds.

1:03:27.004 --> 1:03:28.937
But I did drop the ball
and I know that--

1:03:28.939 --> 1:03:30.906
What mean you don't know?

1:03:30.908 --> 1:03:35.076
Is somebody else eating for
you, or you eating it for yourself?

1:03:35.078 --> 1:03:38.914
No, um, I'm eating
for my, for myself.

1:03:38.916 --> 1:03:42.250
So is it hard to understand
that you're overeating

1:03:42.252 --> 1:03:44.486
to be almost 700 pound?

1:03:44.921 --> 1:03:46.822

and you're still
not losing weight,

1:03:55.199 --> 1:03:57.766
so this is a serious issue
with you.

1:03:57.768 --> 1:03:59.267
So when are you going to wake up

1:03:59.269 --> 1:04:02.103
and do what you say you will?

1:04:02.105 --> 1:04:05.307
- Um...
- Are you expecting us to make you lose weight?

1:04:05.575 --> 1:04:08.043
No, no, I'm not.

1:04:08.045 --> 1:04:12.013
No, I don't expect you guys
to make me lose weight,

1:04:12.015 --> 1:04:16.117
but I know that I do need
the accountability.

1:04:16.119 --> 1:04:18.386
And that's, since our last visit

1:04:18.388 --> 1:04:20.222
I have started reading the book,

1:04:20.224 --> 1:04:22.891
um, and, and so I've,

1:04:22.893 --> 1:04:25.794
I've been working on
implementing it,

1:04:25.796 --> 1:04:29.564
just not every day like
I'm supposed to, and so...

1:04:31.033 --> 1:04:32.734
So, I'm planning on doing that.

1:04:32.736 --> 1:04:36.471
It was just me not paying
attention, not, not mindful,

1:04:36.473 --> 1:04:39.741
eating, or mindful thinking
about eating anything

1:04:39.743 --> 1:04:43.178
and so, that's not right
and so, I do know that.

1:04:43.180 --> 1:04:46.047
So when you plan to cut back?

1:04:46.049 --> 1:04:47.315
Um...

1:04:49.085 --> 1:04:51.086
Now? I mean, I...

1:04:52.989 --> 1:04:55.156
Uh, I don't know, I... Now.

1:04:55.158 --> 1:04:58.827
Uh, you're at very dangerous
point in your life,

1:04:58.829 --> 1:05:01.863
and this is going to be
a difficult situation

1:05:01.865 --> 1:05:03.932
with your BMI being over 100,

1:05:03.934 --> 1:05:06.001
you're gonna run
out of time very soon

1:05:06.003 --> 1:05:09.371
and you're gonna push
your body to a limit, and...

1:05:09.373 --> 1:05:13.942
You have all the elements of everything
given to you to change your life,

1:05:13.944 --> 1:05:16.511
but you're not taking it,
so where is that gonna end?

1:05:17.179 --> 1:05:18.480
Um...

1:05:19.348 --> 1:05:21.883
Not a place
I wanna go right now,

1:05:21.885 --> 1:05:25.086
and that's death, you know,

1:05:25.088 --> 1:05:28.957
um, and I know that, so...

1:05:28.959 --> 1:05:31.559
[Dr. Now] But knowing that is
still not enough for you

1:05:31.561 --> 1:05:32.827
to give up the food,

1:05:32.829 --> 1:05:36.131
and you're not gonna live
much longer at this rate.

1:05:36.133 --> 1:05:38.133
But we can't seem to wake you up

1:05:38.135 --> 1:05:39.567
to understand that,

1:05:39.569 --> 1:05:42.070
so I'm gonna send you
to psychotherapy

1:05:42.072 --> 1:05:44.773
to see if they can make
some sort of difference.

1:05:44.775 --> 1:05:47.542
But if they can't,
then you're done,

1:05:47.544 --> 1:05:49.911
and we are not moving
ahead with you.

1:05:49.913 --> 1:05:53.915
So this is your last chance
to take it, to save your life,

1:05:53.917 --> 1:05:57.752
and if you don't take it, I don't think
you're gonna have any more chances.

1:05:57.754 --> 1:06:01.756
So, you either now do the
right thing or you give it up.

1:06:01.758 --> 1:06:03.191
And be honest with yourself.

1:06:03.193 --> 1:06:06.294
There's nothing magic in here
that can help you

1:06:06.296 --> 1:06:09.698
except you gonna make
the decision to be healthy

1:06:09.700 --> 1:06:11.199
and watch your diet.

1:06:11.201 --> 1:06:13.768
And either you're not
making that decision

1:06:13.770 --> 1:06:15.870
or you're kicking down the road

1:06:15.872 --> 1:06:17.806
and hoping something
will happen,

1:06:17.808 --> 1:06:18.974
but nothing's gonna happen.

1:06:18.976 --> 1:06:20.875
You're gonna have
to do that yourself.

1:06:20.877 --> 1:06:25.246
So, I don't have anything else to
tell you that you haven't heard before.

1:06:25.248 --> 1:06:27.816
We have given you
every chance to lose weight,

1:06:27.818 --> 1:06:29.551
but you're not taking it.

1:06:29.553 --> 1:06:32.754
You're throwing it away and
you aren't doing the right thing.

1:06:32.756 --> 1:06:35.390
So, when?
When you gonna change?

1:06:35.392 --> 1:06:39.761
Uh, I thought
that I was, was ready.

1:06:39.763 --> 1:06:42.564
Actions speaks
much louder than word,

1:06:42.566 --> 1:06:45.900
and the scale tells us
the truth.

1:06:45.902 --> 1:06:48.970
So if you're telling me
you're gonna change,

1:06:48.972 --> 1:06:51.973
well, hope you see that in,
on the scale next time.

1:06:51.975 --> 1:06:53.842
So, this is your last chance

1:06:53.844 --> 1:06:55.377
and I'm gonna give you
the same goal,

1:06:55.379 --> 1:06:57.979
lose 80 pounds
for the next two months.

1:06:57.981 --> 1:07:02.250
And if you do, we'll appeal
for weight loss surgery.

1:07:02.252 --> 1:07:05.020
If not, I don't know
what else we can do for you.

1:07:05.022 --> 1:07:05.987
Okay.

1:07:05.989 --> 1:07:07.355
- Okay?
- Okay.

1:07:07.357 --> 1:07:09.824
All right, if you need
anything, give me a call.

1:07:09.826 --> 1:07:11.159
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you.

1:07:11.161 --> 1:07:12.961
Nice to meet you, too.

1:07:12.963 --> 1:07:14.396
All right, see y'all later.

1:07:14.398 --> 1:07:16.031
All right, thank you
so much, Dr. Now.

1:07:16.033 --> 1:07:17.165
Okay.

1:07:21.103 --> 1:07:25.073
Ontreon still doesn't see
the severity of his situation

1:07:25.075 --> 1:07:26.441
enough to change his life.

1:07:26.742 --> 1:07:30.979
<i>Maybe psychotherapy will be
able to break through to him.</i>

1:07:30.981 --> 1:07:35.917
Especially if Ontreon is using
some past trauma to justify

1:07:35.919 --> 1:07:38.153
<i>the need to go to food
for comfort.</i>

1:07:38.155 --> 1:07:41.890
But if they're not able
to get him to turn around

1:07:41.892 --> 1:07:45.093
<i>and start moving
in the direction he needs,</i>

1:07:45.095 --> 1:07:47.262
<i>even a little bit by next time,</i>

1:07:47.264 --> 1:07:50.165
<i>then it will be clear
he has no intention</i>

1:07:50.167 --> 1:07:53.268
to take responsibility
for his life.

1:07:54.870 --> 1:07:57.639
<i>[Ontreon] I was scared
going into the appointment</i>

1:07:57.641 --> 1:08:01.643
<i>because I didn't know if Dr. Now
was gonna kick me out of the program.</i>

1:08:01.645 --> 1:08:05.613
<i>I'm trying to be honest with
Dr. Now about my shortcomings,</i>

1:08:05.615 --> 1:08:09.884
<i>but I know that I just need
to do better, like he says.</i>

1:08:09.886 --> 1:08:13.321
<i>I can't let Musa down and I
can't let my mom down, either.</i>

1:08:13.323 --> 1:08:15.423
<i>I know they want me to do this.</i>

1:08:17.093 --> 1:08:19.794
<i>This is the point
that I need to change my life,</i>

1:08:19.796 --> 1:08:21.863
<i>and whatever's gonna
do that for me,</i>

1:08:21.865 --> 1:08:23.231
<i>I'm gonna try it.</i>

1:08:23.233 --> 1:08:26.935
<i>Because it feels like I've
already tried a bunch of things,</i>

1:08:26.937 --> 1:08:29.104
<i>and they're not working.</i>

1:08:39.682 --> 1:08:41.616
<i>[Ontreon] Today, I have
my session with Dr. Paradise</i>

1:08:41.618 --> 1:08:43.651
<i>and I think
I'm looking forward to it.</i>

1:08:43.653 --> 1:08:46.521
<i>I know I want to get it out of
the way as soon as possible,</i>

1:08:46.523 --> 1:08:48.189
<i>because I don't think
it's gonna help me</i>

1:08:48.191 --> 1:08:51.826
<i>and I know I have a lot
of issues to work through.</i>

1:08:51.828 --> 1:08:55.096
<i>And it'll be nice
to have someone to talk to.</i>

1:08:55.098 --> 1:08:58.099
<i>I just hope that nothing
comes up here</i>

1:08:58.101 --> 1:09:00.902
<i>that is gonna make my journey
any more difficult</i>

1:09:00.904 --> 1:09:02.237
<i>than it already is.</i>

1:09:02.638 --> 1:09:04.105
Welcome.

1:09:04.107 --> 1:09:06.975
Thank you. It's, it's nice
to meet you, actually.

1:09:06.977 --> 1:09:09.010
[chuckles] It's good
to meet you, too.

1:09:09.012 --> 1:09:10.945
So, tell me a little bit
about yourself.

1:09:11.013 --> 1:09:12.313
Um...

1:09:13.115 --> 1:09:16.050
Well, I am a licensed minister.

1:09:16.052 --> 1:09:17.719
Is that what you wanna do
for a job?

1:09:17.721 --> 1:09:20.488
I think for, for a main
source, I think so.

1:09:20.490 --> 1:09:22.123
- That's what I wanna do, mainly.
- Okay.

1:09:22.125 --> 1:09:24.359
What, what's standing
in the way of that?

1:09:27.830 --> 1:09:30.965
Probably going further
than what I am, I don't know.

1:09:30.967 --> 1:09:33.334
Well, tell me how your,
how your weight loss is going.

1:09:35.137 --> 1:09:38.006
Uh, there's,
there's been a struggle.

1:09:38.008 --> 1:09:39.741
- Okay.
- Um...

1:09:39.743 --> 1:09:41.910
So let, let's...
That's why you're here.

1:09:41.912 --> 1:09:45.079
So let's talk, let's talk
about the struggle, okay?

1:09:45.081 --> 1:09:46.781
What's, what's keeping
you stuck?

1:09:46.783 --> 1:09:48.983
Today, I might care,
tomorrow, I may not.

1:09:49.818 --> 1:09:51.753
Okay, so what puts
you in a place

1:09:51.755 --> 1:09:53.254
where you're not caring?

1:09:53.256 --> 1:09:54.656
[Ontreon] You know, before,

1:09:54.658 --> 1:09:56.958
around 2013, 2014,

1:09:56.960 --> 1:10:00.028
I ended up, um,
losing about 300 pounds.

1:10:00.030 --> 1:10:01.896
What happened after that?

1:10:01.898 --> 1:10:04.232
So, there was
just a lot of death.

1:10:05.034 --> 1:10:06.034
Who died?

1:10:06.036 --> 1:10:09.270
Uh, it started off
with, uh, my aunt.

1:10:09.272 --> 1:10:11.005
Me and her are 14 years apart.

1:10:11.007 --> 1:10:13.441
- Okay, so she wasn't much older than you at all.
- No, no.

1:10:13.443 --> 1:10:14.876
So we was more like sisters.

1:10:14.878 --> 1:10:16.945
Okay. She was
like a sister to you.

1:10:16.947 --> 1:10:18.179
-Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah. How'd she pass?

1:10:18.247 --> 1:10:20.148
Um...

1:10:20.150 --> 1:10:22.917
It was sudden, like,
her heart just stopped.

1:10:22.919 --> 1:10:24.752
Wow. Was she big?

1:10:24.754 --> 1:10:26.955
Uh, she was. She was.

1:10:26.957 --> 1:10:29.090
Okay, keep track of that.

1:10:29.325 --> 1:10:30.858
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:10:30.860 --> 1:10:32.026
What did that do to you?

1:10:32.028 --> 1:10:35.063
One of the issues is
that I'm having is,

1:10:35.065 --> 1:10:38.132
is that if I can figure out
how to departmentalize

1:10:38.634 --> 1:10:39.934
these things,

1:10:39.936 --> 1:10:43.705
and then deal with the issues
at some point,

1:10:43.707 --> 1:10:46.507
- then I could focus-- - How,
how's that working for you?

1:10:46.509 --> 1:10:49.978
I worry that it's, that's, that's
not, um, working out for you...

1:10:50.946 --> 1:10:54.182
and that part of the reason
you're as big as you are now,

1:10:54.184 --> 1:10:57.685
and part of the reason why
you're off track in losing weight

1:10:57.687 --> 1:11:01.256
is 'cause you've got a bunch
of unresolved stuff inside there.

1:11:01.258 --> 1:11:05.093
But it, it's blocking,
um, something for you.

1:11:05.561 --> 1:11:06.561
I agree.

1:11:07.630 --> 1:11:11.032
- So, you're a licensed minister.
- Yes.

1:11:11.034 --> 1:11:13.201
So you probably had
some training in this, right?

1:11:13.203 --> 1:11:15.103
Certainly in, like,
grief counseling, right?

1:11:15.170 --> 1:11:16.471
Um, a little bit.

1:11:16.473 --> 1:11:19.574
What'd you, what'd you learn
about grief counseling?

1:11:19.576 --> 1:11:23.378
Pretty much, allow that person
to, not necessarily to work it out,

1:11:23.380 --> 1:11:27.248
- but to...
- What do you teach them to do?

1:11:27.950 --> 1:11:29.951
I tell them to,

1:11:30.286 --> 1:11:33.021
to mourn, you know?

1:11:33.023 --> 1:11:34.422
[Dr. Paradise]
How have you mourned?

1:11:38.193 --> 1:11:39.394
To be honest, I haven't.

1:11:40.829 --> 1:11:42.096
Bingo.

1:11:43.198 --> 1:11:45.800
I think, I think
that's why you're here.

1:11:45.802 --> 1:11:47.101
I think that's why
we're talking,

1:11:47.103 --> 1:11:49.804
is I'm, I'm here
to convince you to mourn.

1:11:49.806 --> 1:11:53.574
I think until you mourn
those losses

1:11:53.576 --> 1:11:55.576
you're gonna be stuck
in some way or another.

1:11:55.578 --> 1:11:58.279
- You know, this is gonna be your homework.
- Yeah.

1:11:58.281 --> 1:12:00.782
And do you write sermons?
Did you write sermons

1:12:00.784 --> 1:12:02.717
as part of your training?

1:12:02.719 --> 1:12:04.052
Yeah, I did a little bit, yeah.

1:12:04.054 --> 1:12:06.421
So, I want you
to write a sermon about this.

1:12:06.922 --> 1:12:08.990
- Okay.
- You know, um,

1:12:08.992 --> 1:12:12.293
I feel like you have
two kinds of weight to lose.

1:12:12.295 --> 1:12:13.961
- Yeah.
- And the physical weight is

1:12:13.963 --> 1:12:16.964
almost less important
than the emotional weight.

1:12:16.966 --> 1:12:19.233
You're, you're, carrying
around 700 pounds

1:12:19.235 --> 1:12:21.269
of emotional weight, too.

1:12:21.271 --> 1:12:23.071
But it seems
like the emotional weight

1:12:23.073 --> 1:12:24.806
is heavier than the physical.

1:12:24.808 --> 1:12:28.009
- Yeah.
- You know?

1:12:28.011 --> 1:12:30.178
So, Ontreon, I'm gonna
bring your wife in. Is that okay?

1:12:30.180 --> 1:12:32.046
- Yes.
- And what we'll talk about the homework, okay?

1:12:32.048 --> 1:12:33.381
- Okay.
- Great.

1:12:38.253 --> 1:12:39.921
- Hi, are you Musa?
- [Musa] Yes.

1:12:39.923 --> 1:12:42.023
- Hi, Musa, come on in.
- [Musa] All righty.

1:12:42.858 --> 1:12:44.225
You can have a seat
right over there.

1:12:45.294 --> 1:12:46.361
Oh, thank you.

1:12:51.333 --> 1:12:53.501
So, you have a terrific husband.

1:12:53.503 --> 1:12:56.003
Thank you, I know. [laughs]

1:12:56.005 --> 1:12:58.005
Uh, and I'm really impressed
with him,

1:12:58.007 --> 1:13:02.110
and I have some homework,
uh, that I gave to him.

1:13:02.112 --> 1:13:05.146
And I want, um, Ontreon
to tell you about the homework

1:13:05.148 --> 1:13:07.248
so that you can
support him in doing it.

1:13:07.250 --> 1:13:10.785
So, Ontreon, tell Musa
about your homework.

1:13:10.787 --> 1:13:13.054
Dr. Paradise wants me
to write about, um,

1:13:13.056 --> 1:13:15.289
the grief and hope.

1:13:15.291 --> 1:13:17.024
So you're gonna write
a sermon, right?

1:13:17.026 --> 1:13:18.126
- [Ontreon] A sermon.
- Okay.

1:13:18.128 --> 1:13:20.228
About, about that, so...

1:13:20.230 --> 1:13:23.731
So you'll be a good, a good,
receptive audience to that.

1:13:23.733 --> 1:13:24.999
- [Musa] Of course.
- Okay.

1:13:25.001 --> 1:13:26.300
Are you, are you hopeful
for him?

1:13:26.302 --> 1:13:27.902
- Oh, yes, I am.
- Okay.

1:13:27.904 --> 1:13:30.238
- I will.
- [Dr. Paradise] Good.

1:13:30.240 --> 1:13:32.874
Thanks for coming, guys.
Okay, take care, guys.

1:13:32.876 --> 1:13:34.242
[Ontreon] All right,
thank you so much.

1:13:34.877 --> 1:13:37.078
All right, baby.

1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:39.046
- All right, one, two...
- Okay, on three.

1:13:39.214 --> 1:13:41.048
One, two, three.

1:13:42.284 --> 1:13:44.385
Don't you fall. [laughs]

1:13:44.920 --> 1:13:46.788
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1:13:46.790 --> 1:13:48.656
Thanks so much, Dr. Paradise.

1:13:48.658 --> 1:13:50.958
<i>Well, that was challenging.</i>

1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:52.760
<i>Dr. Paradise made
some good points</i>

1:13:52.762 --> 1:13:55.163
<i>and I appreciate his outlook.</i>

1:13:55.165 --> 1:13:58.299
<i>I don't know how to feel about
the homework he set out for me.</i>

1:13:58.301 --> 1:14:00.701
<i>I wanted to be able
to move past things</i>

1:14:00.703 --> 1:14:04.038
<i>in the past and get better.</i>

1:14:04.040 --> 1:14:06.040
<i>And I know if I don't do
this type of stuff,</i>

1:14:06.042 --> 1:14:08.142
<i>it's never gonna happen.</i>

1:14:08.144 --> 1:14:09.944
<i>So I'll do what I have to do.</i>

1:14:09.946 --> 1:14:11.179
[groans]

1:14:21.657 --> 1:14:22.790
[Ontreon] Hello, how are you?

1:14:22.792 --> 1:14:24.058
[cashier] Not bad,
how about yourself, man?

1:14:24.060 --> 1:14:27.929
Good. Let me get, oh, um...

1:14:27.931 --> 1:14:30.731
A caramel frappe
with a cinnamon roll.

1:14:30.733 --> 1:14:32.166
- [cashier] You got it.
- Yeah.

1:14:32.168 --> 1:14:33.801
All right, man. We will
get this right out for you.

1:14:33.803 --> 1:14:35.169
Okay.

1:14:39.007 --> 1:14:41.709
<i>Today, I'm taking some time
to do the homework</i>

1:14:41.711 --> 1:14:45.079
<i>that Dr. Paradise wanted me
to do as a preacher.</i>

1:14:45.081 --> 1:14:49.083
<i>I guess he wants me to write
a message about grief.</i>

1:14:49.085 --> 1:14:52.286
<i>So I decided to grab me
something sweet</i>

1:14:52.288 --> 1:14:55.289
<i>to help me out
with that process.</i>

1:14:56.558 --> 1:14:59.527
<i>It's the little reward that
will help me stay focused.</i>

1:15:01.797 --> 1:15:04.065
<i>So, David wrote
the Book of Psalms.</i>

1:15:04.800 --> 1:15:07.134
<i>He was a king in the Bible.</i>

1:15:07.136 --> 1:15:09.937
<i>You know, David,
he's slaying Goliath</i>

<i>when he was young.</i>

1:15:12.941 --> 1:15:16.410
<i>And so, for him to grow up
being a young king...</i>

1:15:17.746 --> 1:15:19.547
<i>being kind of isolated,</i>

1:15:19.549 --> 1:15:22.083
<i>his life was full of grief.</i>

1:15:23.151 --> 1:15:26.988
<i>I understand, because the
people that I connected to</i>

1:15:26.990 --> 1:15:31.259
<i>that understood who I am,
they're gone.</i>

1:15:31.261 --> 1:15:36.063
<i>And so, I understand
where David is at this point.</i>

1:15:36.065 --> 1:15:38.733
<i>It was like David
was confessing.</i>

1:15:38.735 --> 1:15:41.836
<i>I came to a place of this grief,</i>

1:15:41.838 --> 1:15:45.172
<i>like, it brought depression,
it brought on physical pain,</i>

1:15:45.174 --> 1:15:47.008
<i>it destroyed me.</i>

1:15:47.809 --> 1:15:51.279
<i>You can tell
that depression set in.</i>

1:15:52.681 --> 1:15:54.081
<i>So once he confessed,</i>

1:15:54.083 --> 1:15:58.853
<i>God showed up
and started restoring him.</i>

1:15:58.855 --> 1:16:01.255
<i>Trusting in God,
knowing that He's there,</i>

1:16:01.257 --> 1:16:03.190
<i>knowing that He is with you,</i>

1:16:03.192 --> 1:16:05.560
<i>you know, you can start
to overcome.</i>

<i>I'm heading to my next
appointment with Dr. Now.</i>

1:16:39.661 --> 1:16:40.962
<i>I'm super nervous</i>

1:16:40.964 --> 1:16:43.164
<i>'cause this weigh-in can
make it or break it for me.</i>

1:16:43.966 --> 1:16:46.000
<i>I continued working
on my emotional issues,</i>

1:16:46.002 --> 1:16:48.336
<i>and making progress at that.</i>

1:16:52.741 --> 1:16:55.810
<i>I have a long way to go
before I get to a good place,</i>

1:16:55.812 --> 1:16:59.180
<i>but I'm hoping that the work
has led to more progress.</i>

1:17:00.148 --> 1:17:02.984
<i>I'm scared because
I'm not sure that it has.</i>

1:17:04.019 --> 1:17:07.521
<i>Working on all this
emotional stuff has been good,</i>

1:17:08.790 --> 1:17:11.993
<i>but it made it a lot harder
for me sometimes to end it</i>

1:17:11.995 --> 1:17:15.429
<i>because it makes me want to eat.</i>

1:17:15.431 --> 1:17:19.166
<i>It really does, so it's just been a
struggle these last few months.</i>

1:17:23.238 --> 1:17:26.240

going in a positive direction,</i>

1:17:32.281 --> 1:17:34.815
[nurse] Okay, you can go
ahead and step on the scale.

1:17:34.817 --> 1:17:38.419
[Ontreon] <i>At my last
appointment I weighed 689 pounds,</i>

1:17:40.255 --> 1:17:44.325
<i>and my assignment was to
lose 80 pounds in two months.</i>

1:17:44.327 --> 1:17:47.962
<i>And if I did that today, I would've
been down to 609 pounds.</i>

1:17:51.166 --> 1:17:53.300
Okay, your weight is 704.

1:17:58.974 --> 1:18:01.042
<i>[Ontreon] You know,
I don't know what happened.</i>

1:18:03.145 --> 1:18:05.446
It's so discouraging sometimes.

1:18:08.116 --> 1:18:10.084
[nurse] Okay, we're gonna
go to Room Five.

1:18:11.853 --> 1:18:13.521
<i>[Ontreon] It feels like
no matter what I do,</i>

1:18:13.523 --> 1:18:15.089
<i>it's not gonna be good enough.</i>

1:18:18.727 --> 1:18:22.029
<i>I can't help but feel
that I messed up my chances</i>

1:18:24.800 --> 1:18:27.968
<i>because I know that Dr. Now
would not be happy.</i>

1:18:29.938 --> 1:18:32.073
<i>And if he gives up on me,</i>

I will have let Musa down.</i>

[knocking at door]

1:18:42.417 --> 1:18:43.984
Hello, how y'all doing?

1:18:44.319 --> 1:18:45.286
Good.

1:18:46.121 --> 1:18:47.188
Good.

1:18:47.190 --> 1:18:50.758
Well, Ontreon, what is going on?

1:18:50.760 --> 1:18:52.760
Because not only
did you gain weight,

1:18:52.762 --> 1:18:55.296
you're heavier
than the first day I saw you.

1:18:56.798 --> 1:18:58.232
So it's been seven months,

1:18:58.234 --> 1:19:00.868
and you don't make any progress,

1:19:00.870 --> 1:19:04.105
and nothing we have done
has been able to wake you up,

1:19:04.107 --> 1:19:08.175
and it looks like that
includes psychotherapy, too.

1:19:08.177 --> 1:19:11.245
Did you learn anything
from starting therapy?

1:19:11.247 --> 1:19:14.148
What I learned is that,
um, I needed to deal

1:19:14.150 --> 1:19:16.317
with the emotional baggage,

1:19:16.852 --> 1:19:18.252
um, that I have

1:19:18.254 --> 1:19:21.956
and to, uh, process it

1:19:21.958 --> 1:19:24.825
and, um, learn
how to overcome it.

1:19:24.827 --> 1:19:27.995
I don't know exactly
where I... I messed up at,

1:19:27.997 --> 1:19:32.133
um, 'cause from our discussion
that me and him had, that...

1:19:32.135 --> 1:19:34.101
That it was kind of

1:19:34.103 --> 1:19:37.171
my emotional baggage
is related definitely

1:19:37.173 --> 1:19:39.140
to the... To the weight.

1:19:39.142 --> 1:19:40.808
So somewhere...

1:19:40.810 --> 1:19:43.177
Somewhere I didn't
figure something out,

1:19:43.179 --> 1:19:46.547
and so, um, I definitely
want to see him again,

1:19:46.549 --> 1:19:50.584
um, to continue to work,
um, on the psychological part.

1:19:50.586 --> 1:19:52.620
And I definitely
believe that the...

1:19:52.622 --> 1:19:57.858
That the physical weight, too,
will line up. Um...

1:19:57.860 --> 1:20:00.761
Well, how do you explain
that you gained 15 pounds

1:20:00.763 --> 1:20:02.830
instead of losing any?

1:20:02.832 --> 1:20:05.933
You haven't had made that
choice to change your life,

1:20:05.935 --> 1:20:09.203
and you keep
gaining, gaining, gaining.

1:20:09.205 --> 1:20:12.940
I don't have any objection for
you to seeing the therapist again.

1:20:12.942 --> 1:20:14.375
So you go see,

1:20:14.377 --> 1:20:17.178
uh, your therapist again

1:20:17.180 --> 1:20:19.013
and have... Find a way

1:20:19.015 --> 1:20:21.749
to figure out what is behind

1:20:21.751 --> 1:20:25.152
all those emotional issues
that's driving you to eat.

1:20:25.154 --> 1:20:28.022
And at this point,
we've done all we can,

1:20:28.024 --> 1:20:30.024
but you haven't responded to it.

1:20:30.026 --> 1:20:32.193
But you tell me,
is there anything

1:20:32.195 --> 1:20:34.094
we can do to help you out?

1:20:34.096 --> 1:20:36.463
Anything that we're missing?

1:20:36.465 --> 1:20:38.766
What... What do you think,

1:20:38.768 --> 1:20:43.304
um, we can give you
that is gonna work?

1:20:43.306 --> 1:20:46.440
What do you think is the
solution for the problem?

1:20:46.942 --> 1:20:48.175
Um...

1:20:49.010 --> 1:20:51.312
To be honest right now,
I... You know...

1:20:52.547 --> 1:20:54.982
You know, I... I don't know.
So I guess my...

1:20:54.984 --> 1:20:57.084
My thing is...

1:20:57.086 --> 1:20:59.753
Is that no, I don't have...
I'm not where...

1:20:59.755 --> 1:21:01.355
Where we want to be,

1:21:02.190 --> 1:21:04.325
but just don't
give up on me yet.

1:21:05.727 --> 1:21:08.529
You don't have to.
It's not your position to.

1:21:09.364 --> 1:21:12.066
You can, that's fine.
I understand,

1:21:13.468 --> 1:21:16.170
but I know there's progress
that's been made.

1:21:16.172 --> 1:21:20.140
It's just not as significant
as where we want it to be

1:21:20.142 --> 1:21:22.676
and maybe even as quickly
as we want it to be,

1:21:22.678 --> 1:21:24.545
but there's progress.

1:21:24.547 --> 1:21:28.082
I can say today that,
yes, I want to live today.

1:21:28.084 --> 1:21:31.051
You asked me that yesterday
and I was honest with you.

1:21:31.053 --> 1:21:33.020
I would have told you
no, I don't care,

1:21:33.188 --> 1:21:35.289
but today, I do.

1:21:35.291 --> 1:21:37.157
You know, It's just
one step at a time,

1:21:37.159 --> 1:21:39.860
and it is frustrating.

1:21:39.862 --> 1:21:46.233
You know... You know
everybody was upset at the scale,

1:21:46.235 --> 1:21:49.069
but they don't feel
the disappointment that I feel

1:21:49.971 --> 1:21:51.272
and the frustration.

1:21:52.040 --> 1:21:54.008
So that's on me,

1:21:54.010 --> 1:21:57.011
you know, we can...
We can talk about whatever,

1:21:57.679 --> 1:22:00.314
but that hurts me
more than anybody else

1:22:00.316 --> 1:22:02.716
because I know...
I know the changes that...

1:22:02.718 --> 1:22:03.884
That I've been making

1:22:03.886 --> 1:22:07.254
and trying to be make...
And try to keep making.

1:22:07.256 --> 1:22:11.892
Even though I struggle, even
though the weight says one thing,

1:22:11.894 --> 1:22:13.360
I've been making changes

1:22:13.929 --> 1:22:15.796
and doing my best,

1:22:15.798 --> 1:22:20.000
and... And I understand. I
understand everything that you said.

1:22:20.002 --> 1:22:21.936
I understand everything
that Musa said,

1:22:21.938 --> 1:22:24.038
even my mother,

1:22:24.040 --> 1:22:27.041
you know, even friends,
I understand all of it,

1:22:27.175 --> 1:22:28.976
and but it's just...

1:22:30.245 --> 1:22:33.881
You know, I just... I just gotta
keep to... Continue to work.

1:22:33.883 --> 1:22:36.583
[Dr. Now] Ontreon, I get
what you're saying,

1:22:36.585 --> 1:22:39.486
and I don't doubt that you're
working on some things

1:22:39.488 --> 1:22:42.589
and making
some level of progress,

1:22:42.591 --> 1:22:46.927
but this program with me
can't start without a choice.

1:22:46.929 --> 1:22:50.097
That is the, uh,
situation that we are in,

1:22:50.099 --> 1:22:53.867
and you, in your mind,
you haven't made that choice.

1:22:53.869 --> 1:22:57.237
You just, um,
keep eating everything,

1:22:57.239 --> 1:23:01.175
and you want somebody
to accept the way you are,

1:23:01.177 --> 1:23:03.277
and you don't want
to lose weight,

1:23:03.279 --> 1:23:06.113
and you just want
to make a gesture of it,

1:23:06.115 --> 1:23:08.549
but you're running out of time.

1:23:08.551 --> 1:23:12.119
So I hope to see you
wake up at some point,

1:23:12.121 --> 1:23:14.121
but unless that happens,
there is no need

1:23:14.123 --> 1:23:16.190
to keep wasting time.

1:23:16.192 --> 1:23:19.226
But if you do turn things
around, give me a call.

1:23:19.228 --> 1:23:21.996
Other than that,
I wish you luck. Okay?

1:23:21.998 --> 1:23:23.130
Okay.

1:23:23.132 --> 1:23:24.932
All right, have
a safe trip back.

1:23:24.934 --> 1:23:25.933
Thank you so much.

1:23:25.935 --> 1:23:27.334
[Dr. Now] Bye.

1:23:32.340 --> 1:23:35.576
It is always disappointing
to get to this point.

1:23:35.578 --> 1:23:38.812
I was hoping
sending Ontreon to therapy

1:23:38.814 --> 1:23:42.082
<i>would at least start him
going in the right direction,</i>

1:23:42.084 --> 1:23:44.318
<i>even if it was
just a little bit.</i>

1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:47.221
<i>But the fact that
he gained weight since then</i>

1:23:47.223 --> 1:23:49.957
<i>shows me even more
that he's still waiting</i>

1:23:49.959 --> 1:23:53.193
for someone to save him
from his situation

1:23:53.195 --> 1:23:55.696
<i>and solve his problems for him.</i>

1:23:55.698 --> 1:23:57.197
<i>And that's not gonna work.</i>

1:23:57.199 --> 1:24:00.100
<i>There is no magic solution
out there for him.</i>

1:24:00.102 --> 1:24:03.937
<i>And until he starts to take
responsibility for himself</i>

1:24:03.939 --> 1:24:07.007
<i>to take the first step
towards taking his life back,</i>

1:24:07.009 --> 1:24:09.576
then there is nothing
we can do for him

1:24:09.578 --> 1:24:12.613
to help him, as much
as we may want to.

1:24:12.615 --> 1:24:17.017
<i>But the fact that he wants to
keep going to therapy is positive,</i>

1:24:17.019 --> 1:24:19.853
<i>and if he does that,
then I'm hopeful that Ontreon</i>

1:24:19.855 --> 1:24:21.855
<i>will get to the point</i>

1:24:21.857 --> 1:24:25.959
where he does wake up to make
the choices he needs to save his life

1:24:25.961 --> 1:24:27.928
<i>so that, at some point
down the road,</i>

1:24:27.930 --> 1:24:30.064
we can move ahead with him.

1:24:30.066 --> 1:24:33.467
<i>I just hope he does it
before his time runs out.</i>

1:24:36.538 --> 1:24:39.807
[Ontreon] <i>Well, I know I have
a lot of soul-searching to do,</i>

1:24:39.809 --> 1:24:44.044
<i>and I think that, with Dr. Now
sending me to therapy,</i>

1:24:44.046 --> 1:24:46.880
<i>I see that I've given up
on myself, deep inside.</i>

1:24:46.948 --> 1:24:48.281
Okay.

1:24:48.283 --> 1:24:52.052
<i>And I know that I need to
change that if I want to live.</i>

1:24:54.622 --> 1:24:56.156
<i>I know I need to
fight for my life,</i>

1:24:56.158 --> 1:24:58.358
<i>'cause I feel like
I'm letting everyone down.</i>

1:25:01.729 --> 1:25:02.863
[grunting]

1:25:02.865 --> 1:25:05.132
<i>But that doesn't mean
I'm giving up.</i>

1:25:05.134 --> 1:25:07.801
<i>In some ways,
I'm just beginning.</i>

1:25:07.803 --> 1:25:10.304
[breathing heavily]

1:25:10.306 --> 1:25:14.007
<i>I know that I have a lot of
work to do to save my life,</i>

1:25:14.175 --> 1:25:16.310
<i>but strangely enough,</i>

1:25:16.312 --> 1:25:20.047
<i>I feel like for the first time
in a long time,</i>

1:25:20.049 --> 1:25:21.982
<i>that I'm gonna try to do it.</i>
