00:01.748 --> 00:04.239
<i>In New York City's
war on crime,</i>

00:04.318 --> 00:06.377
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:06.453 --> 00:09.320
<i>by the detectives
of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:09.389 --> 00:11.084
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:13.427 --> 00:14.917
You're sure
it's not gluttony?

00:14.995 --> 00:17.156
Lisa, I know this.
It's sloth.

00:17.230 --> 00:19.528
And your
handwriting is horrible.

00:20.467 --> 00:24.460
Okay, I need quiet.
The quiz isn't over yet.

00:30.110 --> 00:33.079
The deadly sin we were
looking for, sloth.

00:33.146 --> 00:34.511
Yes!
Great!

00:34.581 --> 00:39.848
And the proud new owners of a sexy
Townsend hoodie, Matty's Angels!

00:48.795 --> 00:50.194
Hmm. Orange hoodies.

00:50.263 --> 00:52.322
Isn't this what prisoners have to wear?

00:52.399 --> 00:54.264
Lisa, stay.
Do a shot with me.

00:54.334 --> 00:58.134
Can't. One more missed curfew
and Greg is going to ground me.

01:08.248 --> 01:09.715
Good morning.

01:10.016 --> 01:11.540
Whose is this?

01:12.419 --> 01:13.977
Won it at the quiz.

01:14.054 --> 01:16.352
Play with us sometime.
You'll get one, too.

01:19.593 --> 01:21.788
One of your office girls can wear it.

01:21.862 --> 01:23.022
Might be
a tough sell.

01:45.352 --> 01:47.752
Cologne, right?
A man's cologne?

01:47.821 --> 01:50.346
Beer.
Mr. Beckstead is in Three.

01:54.127 --> 01:55.651
Four for the dinner cruise.

01:55.729 --> 02:00.325
Oh! All the times we've been to New
York, I've always wanted to do this.

02:00.400 --> 02:01.526
Where's Lisa?

02:01.601 --> 02:02.898
She was over there.

02:02.969 --> 02:04.596
Maybe she went to
the ladies' room.

02:04.671 --> 02:06.434
I'll go find her.

02:06.940 --> 02:09.306
Drunk before the
booze cruise. Damn.

02:09.376 --> 02:12.539
Guys, did you see a woman, blonde?

02:16.116 --> 02:17.242
Lisa?

02:21.888 --> 02:23.150
Help me.

02:23.723 --> 02:25.122
Don't worry.

02:26.993 --> 02:30.360
All the tests are normal. I've
controlled her pain with morphine.

02:30.430 --> 02:32.455
So, nothing at all led up to this?

02:32.532 --> 02:36.969
She had mild GI distress
yesterday. She used an OTC antacid.

02:37.504 --> 02:38.971
You'll run more tests?

02:39.039 --> 02:41.405
She needs more
specialized evaluation.

02:48.715 --> 02:49.875
She shouldn't be awake.

02:57.657 --> 02:59.625
Do you have pain, Mrs. Ross?

02:59.693 --> 03:02.787
My face feels strange.

03:09.536 --> 03:12.130
Get the intern on-call
to room 1405. Stat.

03:12.205 --> 03:15.140
What? What's wrong?
Tell me. What's happening?

04:05.125 --> 04:06.490
It's chloracne.

04:06.560 --> 04:08.551
A year ago, even veteran
doctors had never heard of it.

04:08.628 --> 04:10.152
And now your night nurses recognize it.

04:10.230 --> 04:11.993
We can thank that Ukrainian
politician for that.

04:13.166 --> 04:15.896
Have you tested Mrs.
Ross for dioxin poisoning?

04:15.969 --> 04:18.403
We had to send out the
samples. It'll take time.

04:18.471 --> 04:21.668
All the more reason for me to
talk to her as soon as possible.

04:21.741 --> 04:26.701
I'm with the Board of Health. There
are some questions I need to ask.

04:26.780 --> 04:30.807
First of all, have you
consumed sport fish or game?

04:31.585 --> 04:34.611
No. Do you know what's happened to me?

04:34.688 --> 04:37.088
Well, that's what these
questions will help us determine.

04:37.157 --> 04:40.615
I need an inventory of everything
you've consumed in the last week.

04:40.694 --> 04:43.185
Dr. Ross, can you help us out here?

04:46.132 --> 04:48.828
We have dinner out
almost every night.

04:48.902 --> 04:52.235
Except Tuesday.
I see my friends.

04:52.973 --> 04:53.962
Right.

04:54.040 --> 04:57.498
And breakfast she has at
home. Fruit and yogurt.

04:57.577 --> 05:00.410
Maybe you can write
down what you remember.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.438
What do you
do for a living?

05:02.515 --> 05:07.179
Website for wedding
planning, webofjoy.

05:07.921 --> 05:09.946
You work out
of an office?

05:10.357 --> 05:12.882
A converted
brownstone in Brooklyn.

05:13.226 --> 05:15.319
How recent is
the conversion?

05:15.395 --> 05:18.694
We just finished the
renovations two weeks ago.

05:19.099 --> 05:21.067
And where's your office?

05:21.568 --> 05:24.560
In the basement.
It's all been redone.

05:29.643 --> 05:33.511
No one forced Lisa to work down
here. She just liked the quiet.

05:34.581 --> 05:37.482
I maintain a very
healthy work environment.

05:38.084 --> 05:41.053
I keep anti-bacterial
soap in the bathroom.

05:41.121 --> 05:44.557
Hey, you bake that stuff
in the sun 10 years,

05:44.624 --> 05:47.718
add a little chlorine,
you got dioxin.

05:48.061 --> 05:49.619
Good to know.

05:49.696 --> 05:53.462
"Stag and hen packages. " How
long was Lisa working down here?

05:53.533 --> 05:55.592
Not long. She was
developing a new product,

05:55.669 --> 05:57.728
bachelor and bachelorette parties.

05:57.804 --> 06:00.705
You know I said to Lisa, "stag
and hen" just sounds so...

06:00.774 --> 06:02.036
British?

06:02.108 --> 06:03.405
Exactly.

06:10.583 --> 06:12.574
Yeah, it's an exhaust
for an incinerator.

06:12.652 --> 06:15.450
That's what was
bolted down here.

06:16.990 --> 06:18.890
You know, before they
outlawed it in the '70s,

06:18.958 --> 06:22.689
they burned everything back
then. Including plastic.

06:22.762 --> 06:24.730
You burn plastic, you get dioxin.

06:25.498 --> 06:26.658
And you never
get rid of it.

06:26.733 --> 06:29.668
And Lisa was sitting
right under the chimney.

06:31.237 --> 06:34.866
The scrapings I took from the walls
and the exhaust contain dioxin,

06:34.941 --> 06:37.307
but the levels
aren't real impressive.

06:37.377 --> 06:39.208
But it's there.
That's significant.

06:39.279 --> 06:40.837
Dioxin is a slow poison.

06:40.914 --> 06:43.007
You don't get sick overnight,
the way this lady did.

06:43.083 --> 06:45.415
The results on
her dioxin level.

06:46.553 --> 06:47.713
This can't be right.

06:48.755 --> 06:50.586
I've never even heard
of a level like this.

06:50.657 --> 06:54.991
From environmental exposures.
But if she ingested pure dioxin?

06:55.361 --> 06:58.330
If she'd licked the inside of the
incinerator, she wouldn't test this high.

06:58.398 --> 06:59.990
I think we've moved out of
the basement, Mr. Belkin.

07:00.066 --> 07:03.001
We're talking about an
intentional poisoning.

07:03.403 --> 07:05.200
How easy is it to
get pure dioxin?

07:05.271 --> 07:06.499
Not easy for a layman.

07:06.573 --> 07:08.268
How about to make it?

07:09.142 --> 07:15.047
The chemical components are available,
but you'd need a knowledge of chemistry.

07:15.782 --> 07:18.774
Knowledge that a doctor
or dentist might have.

07:19.753 --> 07:21.516
Get a search warrant.

07:21.588 --> 07:24.523
See what Dr. Ross has
been feeding his wife.

07:26.826 --> 07:28.157
I have medicine for her face.

07:28.228 --> 07:29.661
Let me see.

07:30.296 --> 07:32.764
This doesn't work. Don't bother.

07:32.832 --> 07:33.856
I'll just try a little.

07:33.933 --> 07:35.798
Nothing works on chloracne.

07:35.869 --> 07:38.133
I read up on it.

07:46.279 --> 07:48.008
I don't understand.

07:50.016 --> 07:51.745
I don't understand.

07:58.124 --> 07:59.557
You think something
here made her sick?

07:59.626 --> 08:01.594
Should we get
ourselves checked?

08:01.661 --> 08:04.721
We don't think you need to
be worried at this point.

08:04.798 --> 08:08.063
How did your daughter meet
Dr. Ross? Was she a patient?

08:08.134 --> 08:11.433
No. Lisa was a manager at
a pub near Greg's office.

08:11.504 --> 08:13.096
He'd come in for lunch.

08:13.173 --> 08:15.198
They look happy here.

08:15.275 --> 08:19.268
Treats her like a goddess.
Always tells her she's beautiful.

08:20.313 --> 08:22.543
We should get
to the hospital.

08:26.085 --> 08:27.712
All's well in Camelot.

08:27.787 --> 08:31.154
Mom sounds like she wishes
she'd married Dr. Ross.

08:32.192 --> 08:33.659
Look at this.

08:37.931 --> 08:39.558
The alarm is
set for 3:00 p. m.

08:39.631 --> 08:41.121
That's not the alarm.

08:41.601 --> 08:45.162
The alarm is set for 5:15 a.
m., you know, dentist hours.

08:45.705 --> 08:50.904
This is a dual time zone
function set for five hours ahead.

08:50.977 --> 08:54.708
Five hours ahead.
That's what, British Isles?

08:55.949 --> 09:00.181
Bachelor parties, "stag and
hen," that's a British expression.

09:00.253 --> 09:02.551
Kind of posh
for a Jersey girl.

09:03.156 --> 09:06.057
Her husband needs to
be at work by 6:00 a. m.

09:07.026 --> 09:08.516
She's in bed.

09:08.795 --> 09:12.060
She needs to know what
time it is in Great Britain.

09:12.966 --> 09:15.366
It's a boyfriend,
a British boyfriend.

09:15.435 --> 09:18.802
Naughty girl.
Maybe Ross found out.

09:19.973 --> 09:21.702
We need to
talk to her alone.

09:25.879 --> 09:27.039
Eames.

09:29.616 --> 09:30.947
Thanks for calling.

09:31.417 --> 09:32.441
It's too late.

09:36.789 --> 09:37.847
Yes?

09:38.992 --> 09:40.516
Yes, Gregory,
we're both here.

09:42.128 --> 09:43.254
What?

09:52.438 --> 09:56.067
Oh, God. My baby!

10:01.848 --> 10:04.043
My wife is dead.

10:04.450 --> 10:06.441
My apartment's
been ransacked.

10:06.519 --> 10:10.683
I have been questioned by the
police and the Health Department,

10:10.757 --> 10:13.453
and no one can tell me
what the hell happened!

10:13.526 --> 10:15.426
We understand your
frustration, Dr. Ross,

10:15.495 --> 10:19.124
but we're stalled until we figure
out how your wife was contaminated.

10:19.198 --> 10:21.632
My apartment. Is
it safe to go there?

10:21.701 --> 10:23.032
It tested clean.

10:27.006 --> 10:29.201
We have
a few more questions.

10:31.511 --> 10:34.480
Had Lisa been overseas in the last year?

10:35.181 --> 10:37.775
No. I don't think she
even had a passport.

10:37.850 --> 10:40.648
Was she in touch with
anybody in Europe or England?

10:40.720 --> 10:43.314
Maybe a friend or
a business contact?

10:43.756 --> 10:45.849
No. Not that I am aware of.

10:46.592 --> 10:48.651
We're sorry for your loss.

10:49.762 --> 10:52.196
Your TMJ is acting up.

10:52.265 --> 10:53.698
It's stress.

10:55.201 --> 10:57.635
This is unbelievably
awful for me.

11:01.741 --> 11:04.471
Wasn't a lot of laughs for Lisa, either.

11:05.111 --> 11:08.012
He didn't seem all that rattled when
you brought up merry old England.

11:08.081 --> 11:10.015
And before you say it,

11:10.083 --> 11:12.779
if this happened to my wife,
I'd grind my teeth, too.

11:12.852 --> 11:14.752
I wasn't going
to say anything.

11:14.821 --> 11:18.814
I was counting how often he used
the words "me," "my," and "I."

11:19.492 --> 11:22.154
If his wife had
a Brit boyfriend,

11:22.228 --> 11:23.320
there's gotta
be a phone trail.

11:23.396 --> 11:28.026
Sorry, the dumps on her home and work
phones don't show any calls overseas.

11:28.101 --> 11:29.591
You check her computer for e
- mails?

11:29.669 --> 11:32.536
The judge wouldn't include
it in the search warrant.

11:32.605 --> 11:35.403
Eleven. Eleven "me's,"
"my's," and "I's. "

11:36.342 --> 11:39.334
One "she. "
It's all about him.

11:40.346 --> 11:42.780
Get back to that judge about
a warrant for Dr. Ross' office.

11:42.849 --> 11:44.646
Check his deliveries.

11:44.984 --> 11:47.953
Maybe he got his dioxin
from the tooth fairy.

11:48.021 --> 11:51.422
I will, Doctor.
Yes, word-for-word.

11:52.759 --> 11:55.785
Dr. Ross is tied up making
arrangements for Mrs. Ross.

11:55.862 --> 11:58.160
But he said to tell you that
she never came to the office,

11:58.231 --> 12:00.927
so she couldn't have been
contaminated by anything here.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.231
A lot of photos of Dr. Ross and
his wife, especially of his wife.

12:04.303 --> 12:05.861
Even in the examination room.

12:05.938 --> 12:07.997
Well, she was so beautiful.

12:09.242 --> 12:11.710
A lot of people comment on her beauty?

12:11.778 --> 12:12.836
Yes.

12:13.246 --> 12:15.214
I bet
Dr. Ross liked that.

12:16.082 --> 12:17.777
My mother told me to always
stay away from beautiful women.

12:17.850 --> 12:18.942
You know why?

12:19.018 --> 12:22.613
You have to worry all the
time. Well, maybe not you.

12:23.723 --> 12:26.624
Dr. Ross, he worries? I mean,
he'd have to. He's only human.

12:26.692 --> 12:29.559
I kept telling him he
was just imagining things.

12:29.629 --> 12:31.119
For example?

12:31.197 --> 12:32.562
Well, that.

12:32.999 --> 12:35.991
It was Lisa's.
He had me smell it.

12:40.339 --> 12:41.704
It's beer.

12:41.774 --> 12:45.733
Well, that's what I thought. He
said he smelled a man's cologne.

12:48.081 --> 12:50.811
This is every invoice
for the last six months.

12:50.883 --> 12:53.943
Cross-referenced by
supply company and product.

12:56.322 --> 13:00.053
I see you use the same two
courier services for pick-ups.

13:00.126 --> 13:02.253
You have accounts with them?

13:04.263 --> 13:06.697
You have Mercury
Messenger down here.

13:06.766 --> 13:09.132
I didn't see in the
log that you used them.

13:09.702 --> 13:13.297
Dr. Ross asked for their phone
number a couple of weeks ago.

13:13.372 --> 13:15.203
He used them for
his personal business?

13:15.274 --> 13:16.901
I don't know.

13:16.976 --> 13:19.103
Maybe for a pick-up
from the tooth fairy.

13:22.348 --> 13:24.612
It would have been
two weeks ago, give or take.

13:24.684 --> 13:26.311
Yeah, I got that.

13:27.153 --> 13:29.986
<i>Cómo está, Rudy?
Hey, I'm busy right now.</i>

13:32.091 --> 13:34.855
Yeah, sure.
I'll check you later.

13:34.927 --> 13:36.292
All right.

13:36.362 --> 13:41.231
Okay. I'm not finding any
deliveries to or from a Gregory Ross.

13:41.300 --> 13:42.324
No?

13:44.937 --> 13:49.897
L. Ross, delivery to Brooklyn,
what is that, 10 days ago?

13:49.976 --> 13:52.376
Lisa Ross' office.
Who was the sender?

13:52.445 --> 13:55.676
I don't have that information. It
was a walk-in, cash transaction.

13:55.748 --> 13:58.376
Walk-in? Like your
friend who made us?

13:59.018 --> 14:01.851
Looks like you got a lot of
late-night deliveries there.

14:01.921 --> 14:05.880
Your biggest client wouldn't
happen to be Dial-a-Dope, would it?

14:07.059 --> 14:08.219
We don't look at what's in the packages.

14:08.294 --> 14:09.955
We just deliver them.

14:11.063 --> 14:14.226
The ME ran a tox screen. Lisa
tested positive for cocaine,

14:14.300 --> 14:16.825
but there was no
evidence of long-term use.

14:16.903 --> 14:18.700
The coke is probably
what Mercury delivered.

14:18.771 --> 14:22.366
Somehow, her husband got wind of it,
maybe tried to find out who sent it.

14:22.441 --> 14:24.966
Or maybe he arranged
for the delivery himself.

14:25.044 --> 14:26.705
Coke to his
wife's office?

14:26.779 --> 14:28.747
That's too reckless for
a guy who's anything but.

14:28.814 --> 14:32.272
The receptionist at Lisa's office
remembered her opening the package.

14:32.351 --> 14:34.444
There was some kind
of pretty card inside.

14:34.520 --> 14:37.717
Lisa read the card and put the
rest of the package in her purse.

14:37.790 --> 14:40.384
Gift of drugs, courtesy
of her Brit boyfriend.

14:40.459 --> 14:44.555
A gift of pleasure, because he couldn't
be here to pleasure her himself.

14:44.630 --> 14:45.961
So, he helped her
get high by herself?

14:46.032 --> 14:48.762
He would have been better off
saving up for a plane ticket.

14:48.834 --> 14:51.302
Well, there's other ways
for them to get high together.

14:51.370 --> 14:53.201
Naughty cyber pals.

15:01.514 --> 15:04.813
It's negative. No cocaine
residue on these surfaces.

15:06.586 --> 15:10.215
The guy sent her cocaine.
He wanted influence over her.

15:10.590 --> 15:13.457
He'd want to see proof
of that influence.

15:13.526 --> 15:15.153
There's no video cam.

15:20.099 --> 15:24.126
Could you just wait...
Wait a moment, please.

15:27.173 --> 15:29.232
All right, so Lisa, she...

15:30.109 --> 15:33.943
She has the dual time
zone clock next to her bed.

15:35.881 --> 15:40.011
She checks it in the morning, that's
her time, after her husband goes to work.

15:40.086 --> 15:41.678
She figures out when
her boyfriend's online.

15:41.754 --> 15:42.982
They start chatting.

15:45.258 --> 15:49.991
She takes the cocaine
and she types,

15:50.062 --> 15:53.429
as she feels the drug
take effect on her.

15:53.499 --> 15:55.899
So, she gets wired
and starts typing fast.

15:55.968 --> 15:57.492
What a turn-on.

16:06.445 --> 16:09.437
Influence.
He wanted influence.

16:09.515 --> 16:10.948
He would have
told her how to...

16:16.155 --> 16:19.090
He would have told her
how to take the drug.

16:22.862 --> 16:25.262
Could you test
this seat, please?

16:26.465 --> 16:28.023
You think she snorted it off the chair?

16:28.100 --> 16:30.500
We're thinking
she didn't snort it.

16:31.203 --> 16:32.192
Oh.

16:43.582 --> 16:46.244
Positive. Cocaine residue,
right on the money.

16:46.319 --> 16:48.287
Very naughty cyber pals.

16:50.356 --> 16:52.324
This is good-bye for me.

16:52.625 --> 16:54.855
Lisa was my partner.
I can't play without her.

16:54.927 --> 16:57.657
It's so unfair. It was all
coming together for her,

16:57.730 --> 16:59.322
a career and
a great marriage.

16:59.398 --> 17:01.559
Don't go overboard.
What do you mean?

17:01.634 --> 17:02.965
Forget it.

17:03.302 --> 17:04.997
I'm really going to miss her.

17:05.070 --> 17:06.560
A lot of guys will.

17:09.974 --> 17:13.069
Her vaginal tissue tested
positive for cocaine.

17:13.145 --> 17:15.636
Now, in and of itself,
that's not so unusual.

17:15.714 --> 17:20.117
I had a gentleman here last week who
died giving himself a sherry enema,

17:21.087 --> 17:26.047
but I also found
microscopic lesions

17:26.125 --> 17:30.653
that suggested a more caustic chemical
irritant than cocaine alkaloid.

17:30.730 --> 17:31.924
Dioxin.

17:32.264 --> 17:35.256
Bingo. She ingested it
through her vaginal tissue.

17:35.334 --> 17:37.666
The cocaine was
cut with dioxin.

17:39.438 --> 17:43.204
So her boyfriend set up an
online encounter, he directed her,

17:43.275 --> 17:45.675
made sure she took the full dose.

17:46.479 --> 17:49.175
He killed her without
ever touching her.

17:49.248 --> 17:51.978
And they say all the good men are taken.

17:54.987 --> 17:56.750
Enemies?
I don't think so, no.

17:56.822 --> 17:59.814
Lisa didn't have enemies.
Why? What did you find out?

17:59.892 --> 18:01.757
That's funny. We were going
to ask you the same thing.

18:01.827 --> 18:03.317
What did you find out?

18:03.396 --> 18:05.990
Me? Nothing. I am in the dark here.

18:07.133 --> 18:10.933
Mercury Messengers. You in the
dark about Mercury Messengers?

18:11.003 --> 18:12.163
I...

18:12.238 --> 18:15.571
No. I was going to use them
to send x-rays to a colleague.

18:15.641 --> 18:19.042
No, see, your phone records
show you called Mercury

18:19.111 --> 18:22.478
two days after they delivered
a package to your wife.

18:22.782 --> 18:25.114
I saw their name on an
envelope in Lisa's trash.

18:25.184 --> 18:27.345
I tried to find out who sent
it. They wouldn't tell me.

18:27.420 --> 18:28.910
It's all right.

18:28.988 --> 18:32.480
You know, we all get
jealous one time or another.

18:32.858 --> 18:34.052
This was
not jealousy.

18:34.126 --> 18:35.855
I was expecting a
delivery myself and...

18:35.928 --> 18:39.659
Your hygienist said that you were
convinced that this smelled of cologne,

18:39.732 --> 18:40.756
a man's cologne.

18:40.833 --> 18:43.233
You know,
that's jealousy talking.

18:43.769 --> 18:47.466
Were you just taking a flyer,
or was there something to it?

18:47.740 --> 18:52.768
I found a fragment of
a chat on Lisa's computer.

18:52.845 --> 18:56.804
She was chatting with a
man, they seemed friendly.

18:56.882 --> 18:58.782
They used terms
I didn't understand.

18:58.851 --> 19:00.409
Sexual terms?
No.

19:00.820 --> 19:04.449
I just said they were friendly.
It was not a sexual chat.

19:04.990 --> 19:08.289
Okay, friendly terms.
Like what?

19:08.594 --> 19:09.686
"Visual round. "

19:09.762 --> 19:12.993
He said that his was difficult,
and he asked her about hers.

19:13.065 --> 19:15.329
It could be
some private code.

19:15.401 --> 19:16.663
Or a game.

19:18.103 --> 19:19.764
"Townsend Arrows. "

19:20.406 --> 19:22.874
"Arrows" is British slang for "darts. "

19:23.375 --> 19:24.740
She get this
playing darts?

19:24.810 --> 19:28.746
No, she won it playing trivia
a week ago, Tuesday, at a pub.

19:29.081 --> 19:32.141
You mean pub quiz. My
kid brother plays that.

19:33.018 --> 19:35.680
A "visual round" is
a round of the game.

19:35.754 --> 19:37.949
She might have been chatting
with someone she met there.

19:38.023 --> 19:39.081
Another player.

19:39.158 --> 19:41.183
Do you know who she
played with Tuesday nights?

19:41.260 --> 19:43.785
A married couple,
food-and-beverage types.

19:43.896 --> 19:46.091
They play at a pub downtown, Dempsey's.

19:46.165 --> 19:49.794
I played with them once. A waste
of time. I have patients waiting.

19:49.869 --> 19:51.359
Just one more thing.

19:51.437 --> 19:54.497
Why didn't you tell us about
your wife's online relationship?

19:54.573 --> 19:59.010
It was not a relationship, and I
didn't want you wasting your time.

20:03.849 --> 20:05.441
How considerate.

20:05.818 --> 20:07.683
He's a conflicted man.

20:07.753 --> 20:11.712
Flaunted his wife's beauty,
felt validated by it,

20:11.790 --> 20:14.156
and then ridicules her,
her friends, her hobbies.

20:14.226 --> 20:16.251
"Food-and-beverage types. "

20:17.196 --> 20:19.994
People she might be
sharing her secrets with.

20:20.065 --> 20:22.397
I see a pub quiz in our future.

20:23.602 --> 20:24.864
Matty's Angels?

20:24.937 --> 20:27.132
Uh, I'm Matty.
This is Marcia.

20:27.406 --> 20:28.896
You two looking
to join a team?

20:28.974 --> 20:30.737
Well, we never played before.

20:30.843 --> 20:32.435
Quiz is about fun.

20:32.511 --> 20:35.002
If you're a jerk who always has
to be right, this isn't for you.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.570
Maybe we should sit this out.

20:36.649 --> 20:39.049
You got
a know-it-all man, too?

20:39.118 --> 20:40.710
Partner,
as in police.

20:40.786 --> 20:42.515
We need to talk to
you about Lisa Ross.

20:42.588 --> 20:46.149
Ready, everyone? Our next
round is American Presidents.

20:46.625 --> 20:52.154
In 1876, he won the popular
vote, but lost the presidency.

20:52.231 --> 20:53.220
I got that.

20:53.299 --> 20:55.665
We write our
answers down.

20:56.802 --> 20:58.167
It's Tilden.
Oh, yeah!

20:58.237 --> 20:59.295
Who is it?
It's Tilden.

20:59.371 --> 21:00.998
Okay.
Before she died,

21:01.073 --> 21:05.567
Lisa was chatting online with
another pub quiz player, a man.

21:05.644 --> 21:09.273
He might have told her that he
was British. Living in England.

21:09.348 --> 21:10.838
Lisa never said anything
to me.

21:10.916 --> 21:15.546
The White House bathtub was replaced
at the request of this president.

21:15.621 --> 21:17.521
I have it. It's Taft.

21:19.658 --> 21:21.057
Taft was enormous.

21:21.126 --> 21:24.289
This person might have
been masking their identity

21:24.363 --> 21:26.263
because they had a
grudge against Lisa.

21:26.332 --> 21:28.129
It's very important that we find him.

21:28.901 --> 21:30.732
We didn't talk
about that stuff.

21:30.803 --> 21:32.134
You guys make
your own scorecards?

21:32.204 --> 21:33.603
It's easy,
on the computer.

21:33.672 --> 21:37.836
This presidential pair ran a
country that didn't elect them.

21:38.310 --> 21:40.335
It's Ford and Rockefeller.

21:41.146 --> 21:43.637
A devil with horns
and three halos.

21:44.783 --> 21:47.183
Nice.
Who's the third angel?

21:48.153 --> 21:51.418
Colleen. She's so upset
about Lisa, she won't play.

21:51.790 --> 21:52.984
They were close?

21:53.058 --> 21:54.753
Drinking pals, anyway.

21:54.827 --> 21:57.125
Colleen hooked up
with us six months ago.

21:57.196 --> 21:59.061
She likes to party after
the quiz.

21:59.131 --> 22:01.656
Lisa was a level-10
stud magnet.

22:02.067 --> 22:04.058
She reeled them in and
then threw them to Colleen.

22:05.504 --> 22:07.404
Maybe not all of them?

22:07.573 --> 22:09.734
Colleen said a lot of
guys would miss Lisa.

22:09.808 --> 22:13.141
Hmm. Girl speak. You
got a number for Colleen?

22:16.949 --> 22:19.611
Lisa was beautiful, so,
obviously, men will miss her.

22:19.685 --> 22:20.913
That's all I meant.

22:20.986 --> 22:23.420
Marcia was pretty sure
you meant something else,

22:23.489 --> 22:27.016
and we know there was somebody,
another pub quiz player.

22:27.092 --> 22:30.061
What difference would it
make? She got food poisoning.

22:30.129 --> 22:32.723
No, the poisoning,
it was deliberate.

22:32.965 --> 22:34.330
Oh, no.

22:34.400 --> 22:37.563
You're not protecting her
by keeping her secrets.

22:39.438 --> 22:41.429
She did talk about a guy.

22:41.774 --> 22:43.503
She compared him to her husband.

22:44.109 --> 22:45.542
It was very mean.

22:46.378 --> 22:48.869
Well, we've heard it all.
Don't be shy.

22:48.947 --> 22:52.383
She said the way he touched
her wasn't like Greg.

22:52.751 --> 22:54.378
It wasn't dental.

22:54.953 --> 22:56.580
Now, that we haven't heard.

22:56.655 --> 22:59.954
So Lisa was actually having an affair?

23:01.727 --> 23:04.218
But we've gone
over her schedule.

23:05.531 --> 23:07.431
I mean, we don't know
when she had the time.

23:07.499 --> 23:09.660
She saw him
in the morning.

23:09.735 --> 23:11.498
She called him Mr. Coffee.

23:11.570 --> 23:14.835
He brought her coffee after
her husband went to work.

23:14.907 --> 23:18.138
But look, the times we stayed out late,

23:18.210 --> 23:20.337
I saw her make out with a lot of guys.

23:21.480 --> 23:24.210
There could have been more than one guy.

23:25.317 --> 23:27.080
Sure, we understand.

23:28.387 --> 23:30.321
<i>Colleen,
your lunch is here.</i>

23:31.490 --> 23:32.889
Is that it?

23:33.358 --> 23:34.689
That's it.

23:39.264 --> 23:41.164
That's an early lunch.

23:42.801 --> 23:44.166
Excuse me.

23:44.269 --> 23:46.999
Colleen, what time
does her shift start?

23:47.072 --> 23:48.096
7:00.

23:48.173 --> 23:50.403
She was 9:00 to 5:00,
but she asked to change.

23:50.476 --> 23:51.966
Probably so she could go on auditions.

23:52.044 --> 23:53.443
A lot of our temps are actresses.

23:53.512 --> 23:56.345
She also changed
the layout of her cubicle.

23:56.415 --> 24:00.749
I noticed that they drilled a
new hole for her computer cable.

24:00.819 --> 24:03.811
Yeah. She was getting
a glare from her screen.

24:04.156 --> 24:05.953
All right.
Thank you.

24:06.725 --> 24:10.786
Come on, look at
all these cubicles.

24:11.296 --> 24:13.924
Anyone passing by
can see the screens,

24:14.366 --> 24:18.166
but Colleen moved her computer
so she could have privacy.

24:18.237 --> 24:20.569
Well, private
chats at 7:00 a. m.

24:20.839 --> 24:23.899
Maybe she was doing her
acting on the Internet.

24:24.843 --> 24:28.108
So Colleen was the one on the
computer, chatting up Lisa,

24:28.180 --> 24:29.306
pretending to be a guy,

24:29.381 --> 24:31.406
conning her into
poisoning herself.

24:33.185 --> 24:35.244
Lab find anything on
their computers? Nothing.

24:35.320 --> 24:38.687
Colleen's work computer crashed
two days after Lisa got sick.

24:38.757 --> 24:40.987
The hard drive
got reformatted.

24:41.059 --> 24:42.151
These girls
have a history?

24:42.227 --> 24:43.421
They met
six months ago.

24:43.495 --> 24:47.329
They saw each other once a week at
the pub. Everybody said they got along.

24:47.399 --> 24:50.698
Colleen went out of her way
to make Lisa seem promiscuous.

24:50.769 --> 24:52.862
Now, that's usually a
sign of sexual jealousy.

24:52.938 --> 24:55.839
Maybe they had the hots for the same
guy. Do we have anything else on her?

24:55.908 --> 24:58.638
Well, she moved from upstate a year ago.

25:00.312 --> 25:01.870
She worked for an
environmental group,

25:01.947 --> 25:03.676
Planet Preserve,
for three years.

25:03.749 --> 25:06.650
Before that, it was community
college, waitressing.

25:06.718 --> 25:11.382
Planet Preserve, their website
will list their projects.

25:23.435 --> 25:24.732
Well,
it was a clerical job,

25:24.803 --> 25:28.170
but Colleen was so smart,
so curious about science.

25:28.240 --> 25:31.971
Could you send her a big hi from me,
Jack, who taught her soil testing?

25:32.044 --> 25:33.170
You mentored her?

25:33.245 --> 25:36.339
I unchained her from the
Xerox machine whenever I could.

25:36.415 --> 25:39.248
Take her out into the field or
over to the lab at the college.

25:39.318 --> 25:42.719
She work with a lot of
pollutants? Dioxin, in particular?

25:42.788 --> 25:46.588
Of course. There's nearly three million
cubic yards of contaminated sediment

25:46.658 --> 25:48.819
along this strip of
river alone.

25:48.894 --> 25:54.764
You know, it sounds like you
awakened, like, a passion in her.

25:55.167 --> 25:57.067
Was she like that?
Passionate?

25:57.135 --> 25:59.433
Fixating on a person or a cause?

25:59.504 --> 26:01.267
Well, certainly on this cause.

26:01.340 --> 26:04.070
And I think I found out why,
after she left.

26:04.142 --> 26:06.235
She might have had a health problem.

26:06.311 --> 26:08.404
From environmental contamination?

26:08.480 --> 26:09.606
I thought so.

26:09.681 --> 26:13.549
She kept getting these bills
here from Saint Edwin's Hospital.

26:13.619 --> 26:15.849
I was afraid
she had a cancer.

26:20.192 --> 26:24.060
I'm Dr. Ross. I'm running
behind today. I apologize.

26:24.796 --> 26:28.698
It's not the way I like to start
things off with a new patient.

26:29.902 --> 26:32.632
You don't have to
say anything, Gregory.

26:36.275 --> 26:40.609
I know and you know,
and it's okay.

26:42.447 --> 26:43.937
We'll be fine.

26:49.988 --> 26:52.252
Colleen Dexler was
not a patient here.

26:52.324 --> 26:56.385
The bills she received were for
somebody else, a family member?

26:56.461 --> 27:00.591
Sister. Last name,
Dexler, first name, Morgan.

27:01.099 --> 27:03.897
Date of birth,
March 8th, 1973.

27:03.969 --> 27:07.530
<i>Deceased 1994.
That's all I can tell you.</i>

27:08.573 --> 27:09.972
Cause of death?

27:10.042 --> 27:11.441
Undetermined.

27:11.510 --> 27:13.307
Thank you.
Good-bye.

27:17.349 --> 27:21.786
Undetermined. The Westchester ME
might have an opinion about that.

27:23.956 --> 27:26.823
Morgan Dexler,
21, female Caucasian.

27:27.192 --> 27:31.356
Eleven years ago, she presented at
Saint Edwin's with a variety of symptoms.

27:31.430 --> 27:34.524
Then that turned into this.

27:37.769 --> 27:40.033
They still don't know
what happened to her.

27:40.105 --> 27:41.572
We can guess.

27:45.944 --> 27:49.345
Hmm.
It still haunts me.

27:49.414 --> 27:52.577
Dioxin. God.
Never occurred to us.

27:53.552 --> 27:54.951
Morgan's younger sister,
Colleen,

27:55.020 --> 27:56.487
did you have much
contact with her?

27:56.555 --> 27:58.955
She was the only family
member that I dealt with.

27:59.024 --> 28:00.753
Of course,
there was no father.

28:00.826 --> 28:04.421
Her mother came to the hospital
once, but the cysts on Morgan's face

28:04.496 --> 28:05.827
just scared her off.

28:05.897 --> 28:08.832
So Colleen made the
decisions about Morgan's care?

28:08.900 --> 28:14.270
I mean, it wasn't ideal. She was highly
emotional, very devoted to her sister.

28:14.339 --> 28:18.708
Morgan was a... She was
such a beautiful girl.

28:19.511 --> 28:21.342
Was anybody else
close to Morgan?

28:21.413 --> 28:23.745
Beautiful girls
usually have boyfriends.

28:23.815 --> 28:26.909
Well, she had one,
but I never met him.

28:27.819 --> 28:29.081
He didn't go
to the hospital?

28:29.154 --> 28:32.885
No, not while I was there. I was
told he had a very busy practice.

28:32.958 --> 28:34.289
He was a doctor?

28:35.060 --> 28:36.652
A local dentist.

28:42.667 --> 28:46.501
Well, finally, an answer. You
know, when I lost my angel,

28:46.571 --> 28:49.802
my pastor said that God
would reveal in the future

28:50.242 --> 28:52.472
what we couldn't fathom today.

28:53.478 --> 28:55.070
Is this Colleen
or Morgan?

28:55.147 --> 28:56.739
Oh,
Morgan, of course.

28:57.215 --> 28:59.479
That's from a
catalogue she did.

28:59.785 --> 29:01.184
She was 11.

29:01.553 --> 29:03.282
Well, sit, sit.
Look...

29:03.355 --> 29:06.347
Let me
show you something here.

29:07.059 --> 29:08.526
Look at this.

29:10.395 --> 29:15.628
This... Oh, right. Oh, this. Now,
this was from the Foliage Fair.

29:16.268 --> 29:18.862
<i>She did the song
from The Fantasticks.</i>

29:19.938 --> 29:21.132
She's gorgeous.

29:21.206 --> 29:24.369
The boys must have been
lining up at your door.

29:24.776 --> 29:28.507
Local trash. You know, none of
them was good enough for her.

29:29.014 --> 29:32.313
But she did have a boyfriend,
didn't she? A dentist?

29:32.684 --> 29:35.050
Gregory, a person of quality.

29:35.854 --> 29:41.087
They were engaged, but he
moved away after Morgan died.

29:41.159 --> 29:43.320
He was just
so heartbroken.

29:43.395 --> 29:46.558
We were surprised that he didn't
spend more time at the hospital.

29:46.631 --> 29:48.724
Morgan's doctor said
that he had never met him.

29:48.800 --> 29:51.928
Gregory had his patients
to think of and,

29:52.003 --> 29:54.335
you know, he was such
a wonderful dentist.

29:55.006 --> 29:58.203
He did this
crown for me.

29:58.977 --> 30:01.878
Eleven years.
You know, it's still perfect.

30:02.280 --> 30:04.578
One visit.
Only took an hour.

30:05.050 --> 30:09.851
Did Colleen have anything to
do with Gregory's staying away?

30:10.388 --> 30:13.357
We heard she was at
the hospital every day.

30:13.425 --> 30:15.256
Her work hours were flexible.

30:15.327 --> 30:17.420
It's hard for you, this...

30:17.496 --> 30:19.896
Seeing your beautiful
daughter disfigured.

30:25.137 --> 30:28.573
She was such a beauty,
you know. An angel.

30:29.508 --> 30:32.033
Well, she was lucky she had Colleen.

30:32.878 --> 30:34.709
Did Gregory get
along with Colleen?

30:34.779 --> 30:36.440
They were friends.

30:36.882 --> 30:38.281
Because of Morgan.

30:38.350 --> 30:39.510
No.

30:39.584 --> 30:43.281
Gregory ate at the restaurant
where Colleen worked.

30:43.355 --> 30:47.018
She brought him home,
and then he met Morgan.

30:47.826 --> 30:52.593
But he dated Colleen first? That
must have made for some tension.

30:53.031 --> 30:56.330
Oh, not at all.
That kind of man wants a star.

31:00.305 --> 31:04.036
"A star. " That must have
made Colleen feel special.

31:04.109 --> 31:08.102
She might have been carrying a
torch for Gregory all these years.

31:11.983 --> 31:13.883
And why didn't he tell us
that he had a girlfriend

31:13.952 --> 31:17.149
who died of the same
symptoms, same disfigurement?

31:17.622 --> 31:19.817
Because he poisoned
her in the first place.

31:19.891 --> 31:21.688
Well, we might have gotten this wrong.

31:21.760 --> 31:24.024
He might have killed
Morgan and Lisa.

31:24.095 --> 31:27.929
We had no luck figuring out where
he got the dioxin three weeks ago.

31:27.999 --> 31:32.163
I wouldn't hold my breath figuring
out where he got it 11 years ago.

31:32.704 --> 31:34.899
The crown that he made
for Colleen's mother.

31:34.973 --> 31:37.498
She said that he
made it in an hour.

31:37.976 --> 31:40.809
Now, he must have had
a lab in his office.

31:43.548 --> 31:46.915
Dr. Ross used to share a
practice with my father.

31:46.985 --> 31:49.476
Dad was old school.
He had the lab.

31:49.955 --> 31:53.550
After he retired, I closed it
and put the apparatus in storage.

31:53.625 --> 31:54.956
What about the
chemicals he used?

31:55.026 --> 31:56.687
Do you have
records of those?

31:57.996 --> 31:59.361
Right here.

32:00.332 --> 32:02.357
Do you have fond
memories of Dr. Ross?

32:02.434 --> 32:06.063
Dad loved him.
He was all work and no play.

32:06.137 --> 32:09.937
Well, he played a little. Didn't
he have a stunning girlfriend?

32:10.442 --> 32:13.434
Over in Dobbs Ferry.
Morgan Dexler.

32:14.613 --> 32:17.639
Queen of the Hudson
Valley Beauty Pageants.

32:17.716 --> 32:21.675
I felt bad for him. He
called her his fiancée,

32:21.753 --> 32:23.914
but my friends and I would see
her late at night with this kid,

32:23.989 --> 32:25.957
Jason Crick, a mechanic.

32:26.224 --> 32:28.988
The lab had ether, chlorine.

32:29.628 --> 32:32.563
Add plastic to that soup
and you get dioxin.

32:34.699 --> 32:39.193
This very tidy,
very thorough inventory.

32:40.739 --> 32:42.468
Any reason you kept it?

32:42.540 --> 32:45.998
In case I got another visit
from an environmental group.

32:46.077 --> 32:47.738
Which group visited you?

32:47.812 --> 32:51.111
Planet Preserve,
two years ago,

32:51.182 --> 32:53.707
to check on our disposal
of hazardous chemicals.

32:54.085 --> 32:56.280
That's when I
closed the lab.

32:56.655 --> 32:58.885
Do you remember who they sent?

32:59.724 --> 33:02.090
A woman around my age.

33:05.096 --> 33:06.688
Yes, that's her.

33:09.234 --> 33:12.533
Forensics found dioxin
residue on the lab apparatus.

33:12.737 --> 33:16.173
Meaning Dr. Ross poisoned his
fiancée, Morgan Dexler, 10 years ago.

33:16.241 --> 33:18.106
Because she was cheating
on him with a mechanic.

33:18.176 --> 33:21.339
He went after her
principal asset, her beauty.

33:21.546 --> 33:23.377
Colleen figured out
what he did.

33:23.448 --> 33:24.574
Then why not
turn him in?

33:24.649 --> 33:27.709
Probably because she has
her own plans for Gregory.

33:27.786 --> 33:31.688
She lured his wife Lisa into an online
relationship in order to kill her.

33:31.756 --> 33:35.385
Eliminating her as a romantic rival
and giving her leverage over Gregory.

33:35.460 --> 33:38.918
He killed Colleen's sister
and Colleen killed his wife.

33:39.064 --> 33:42.261
Jealousy and desire. What
tangled webs they weave.

33:42.734 --> 33:46.568
Let's start with Dr. Ross. He
knows he's guilty of one murder.

33:46.905 --> 33:48.896
We charge him with two,

33:48.973 --> 33:51.874
maybe we can convince
him to cut his losses.

33:53.645 --> 33:56.113
Dr. Ross is a
respected professional.

33:56.181 --> 33:59.207
How anyone could think he's
capable of this is beyond me.

33:59.284 --> 34:01.445
Simple,
he's done it before,

34:01.519 --> 34:03.146
10 years ago for
the same reason.

34:03.221 --> 34:06.019
He knew his fiancée, Morgan
Dexler, was cheating on him.

34:06.091 --> 34:07.422
I knew no such thing.

34:07.492 --> 34:08.857
With the local grease monkey.

34:08.927 --> 34:11.918
All the girls at your
old dental office knew.

34:11.996 --> 34:14.328
Well, they
neglected to tell me.

34:14.998 --> 34:16.989
Doctor, it's not
just that your lab

34:17.068 --> 34:19.661
had all the ingredients
to make dioxin.

34:19.737 --> 34:22.969
Or that we found dioxin
residue on the lab apparatus.

34:23.041 --> 34:26.168
It's your absence from the
hospital when Morgan was sick.

34:26.244 --> 34:30.078
We didn't know what she had. I
couldn't risk infecting my patients.

34:30.148 --> 34:35.882
I'm sure a jury will be moved by your
concern. Fact remains, twice in 10 years.

34:36.487 --> 34:38.217
I've talked to the Westchester D.A.

34:38.289 --> 34:40.257
Plead to the murder of your choice,

34:40.324 --> 34:44.420
we'll agree to 25-to-life and waive
prosecution for the other murder.

34:44.496 --> 34:47.431
Fight us, and we'll
prosecute you for both.

34:47.498 --> 34:50.024
We'll leave you alone
to discuss it.

34:52.971 --> 34:55.871
There's another suspect
you should consider.

34:57.442 --> 34:59.433
Morgan's sister, Colleen.

35:00.378 --> 35:05.645
She showed up at my office
this week, making threats,

35:06.184 --> 35:09.085
presuming we had
some kind of relationship.

35:09.220 --> 35:10.278
Did you?

35:10.355 --> 35:12.186
Of the most
superficial kind.

35:12.857 --> 35:15.849
She sent me
cards at Christmas.

35:15.927 --> 35:19.328
She called me on the
anniversary of Morgan's death.

35:19.998 --> 35:21.932
She's fixated on me.

35:22.000 --> 35:26.130
I met her. She was a waitress
in Dobbs Ferry. I ask her out,

35:26.204 --> 35:28.001
next thing you know,

35:28.206 --> 35:30.731
her mother's thrusting
Morgan at me.

35:31.276 --> 35:32.903
Her mother?
Yes.

35:33.278 --> 35:35.303
Colleen never got over it.

35:35.780 --> 35:38.442
She must have poisoned
Morgan and now Lisa.

35:38.516 --> 35:40.143
She is a monster.

35:40.218 --> 35:45.417
A monster, Mr. Carver. And a perfectly
reasonable alternate theory of the crime.

35:46.424 --> 35:48.449
We'll pass on your offer.

35:54.299 --> 35:55.561
Nice try.

35:56.100 --> 35:58.625
Problem is we got two good
suspects for both crimes.

35:58.703 --> 36:01.831
We'll get nowhere as long as they
point the finger at each other.

36:01.906 --> 36:05.000
Colleen's been waiting
for Dr. Ross for 10 years.

36:05.076 --> 36:09.638
And now, the life that she's dreamed of
as the new Mrs. Ross is within her grasp.

36:09.714 --> 36:12.274
She won't toss it away by
accusing Gregory of murder.

36:12.350 --> 36:14.318
We need to throw
her off her game.

36:14.385 --> 36:18.549
If we put another obstacle in her way,
she might hang herself climbing over it.

36:18.623 --> 36:21.057
What obstacle do
you have in mind?

36:21.326 --> 36:24.318
The one that she's been
running into all her life.

36:25.029 --> 36:28.430
No, Lisa said Dr. Ross
was kind and gentle.

36:28.500 --> 36:30.092
She never said
he threatened her.

36:30.401 --> 36:34.462
Didn't she tell you that the way
he touched her, it was dental?

36:35.940 --> 36:40.502
That's just one of those catty things
that was always coming out of Lisa's mouth.

36:40.578 --> 36:42.512
She wanted excitement.

36:42.580 --> 36:43.604
Like Mr. Coffee.

36:43.681 --> 36:47.412
There were others, too. One
of those guys poisoned her.

36:47.652 --> 36:50.314
Her husband might have bored her to
death, but he would never hurt her.

36:50.388 --> 36:51.855
He's a pussycat.

36:51.923 --> 36:53.447
We've been tracking
down his old girlfriends.

36:53.525 --> 36:55.925
We came across
one you might know.

36:58.329 --> 37:00.763
Morgan Dexler.
Your sister, right?

37:03.067 --> 37:05.501
Okay, I wasn't totally honest.

37:06.704 --> 37:09.969
Dr. Ross and I kept in
touch after Morgan died.

37:10.074 --> 37:11.803
Totally as friends.

37:12.210 --> 37:15.646
When he finally got married,
I was real happy for him.

37:16.281 --> 37:19.216
And how did you end
up friends with Lisa?

37:19.651 --> 37:23.052
Dr. Ross told me he
suspected Lisa of cheating.

37:23.555 --> 37:25.580
He thought it might
be someone at the pub.

37:25.657 --> 37:29.184
I went there to check it out,
for his sake, as a friend.

37:29.427 --> 37:31.361
You told Dr. Ross
what Lisa was doing?

37:31.429 --> 37:34.421
No. I couldn't stand breaking his heart.

37:37.602 --> 37:40.162
We appreciate your
honesty, Ms. Dexler.

37:42.106 --> 37:44.700
Mrs. Dexler's early,
but I thought...

37:45.510 --> 37:47.808
No problem.
Have a seat, Mrs. Dexler.

37:47.879 --> 37:49.676
I thought this
was about Morgan.

37:49.747 --> 37:50.941
It is.

37:52.083 --> 37:56.281
We forgot to mention that Dr. Ross
was also charged with Morgan's murder.

37:56.354 --> 37:58.618
Gregory?
Oh, that's impossible.

37:58.690 --> 38:02.854
No, see, we found evidence
that he cooked up dioxin

38:02.927 --> 38:05.054
in his old
dental office.

38:06.264 --> 38:09.461
He poisoned your daughter,
just like he poisoned his wife.

38:09.534 --> 38:10.831
Well, that...
It makes no sense.

38:10.902 --> 38:11.926
That's what I said.

38:12.003 --> 38:13.027
Yeah, all right.

38:13.104 --> 38:15.732
Gregory and Morgan were engaged.

38:15.807 --> 38:16.831
They were in love.

38:16.908 --> 38:18.307
Well, maybe Gregory was,

38:18.376 --> 38:20.810
but we don't think that Morgan
was ready to settle down.

38:20.878 --> 38:26.009
The girls at Gregory's old office remembered
seeing her with a young man, a mechanic.

38:26.084 --> 38:28.644
It's true, Mom. She was
still seeing Jason Crick.

38:28.720 --> 38:32.121
You spiteful girl, how can you
say that about your poor sister?

38:32.190 --> 38:33.623
You saw them together,
Colleen?

38:33.691 --> 38:36.990
Gregory did. He hired a
detective to follow Morgan.

38:37.061 --> 38:40.997
Well, I don't believe it. My
Morgan had class and standards.

38:41.265 --> 38:44.098
Even if the detective
misinterpreted what he saw,

38:44.168 --> 38:48.628
it would give a jealous guy like Dr.
Ross a powerful motive to hurt Morgan.

38:48.706 --> 38:52.301
And, like we said, we found dioxin
residue on his lab equipment.

38:52.377 --> 38:53.674
Oh, dear God.

38:53.745 --> 38:55.975
But he didn't do
anything to Morgan.

38:56.047 --> 39:00.074
You see, on the other hand, if
she was sleeping with the mechanic,

39:01.352 --> 39:03.217
he might be
who was jealous.

39:03.287 --> 39:04.754
That's right.

39:05.289 --> 39:09.248
Morgan told me Jason said if he
couldn't have her, no one would.

39:09.327 --> 39:13.457
And garages have all kinds
of toxic sludges lying around.

39:13.798 --> 39:17.256
Yes. Garages are full of
pollutants, including dioxin.

39:17.335 --> 39:18.700
Maybe we should
bring this kid in.

39:18.770 --> 39:21.295
We can't.
Car crash, four years ago.

39:21.673 --> 39:25.473
For the last time, my daughter never
gave that trash the time of day.

39:25.543 --> 39:27.670
Mom, she was
sleeping with him.

39:27.745 --> 39:31.738
It sounds like Morgan was just
taking advantage of Gregory.

39:31.816 --> 39:34.284
She was.
That's just not true.

39:34.786 --> 39:36.276
There he goes.

39:38.056 --> 39:40.047
Where are they taking him?

39:40.124 --> 39:43.685
Rikers. And with two murder
charges, he won't be getting bail.

39:43.761 --> 39:46.321
You don't think
he deserves this?

39:46.397 --> 39:48.092
You think he's
too kind and gentle?

39:48.166 --> 39:49.190
Yes.

39:49.267 --> 39:52.566
Well, didn't you hear them?
He murdered your sister.

39:53.171 --> 39:55.002
He murdered my angel.

39:55.073 --> 39:58.133
Well, Colleen would know
better. She dated him.

39:58.209 --> 40:00.109
Did she tell you that?

40:00.812 --> 40:03.110
Breakfast.

40:03.881 --> 40:06.907
He took you to breakfast
at a family restaurant.

40:06.984 --> 40:08.849
A family restaurant?
How romantic.

40:08.920 --> 40:11.650
That's a man's way of telling
a woman he's not interested.

40:11.723 --> 40:13.122
Mom, don't say that!

40:13.191 --> 40:14.818
It wasn't
just breakfast.

40:17.195 --> 40:20.653
Colleen and Gregory, they
kept in touch over the years.

40:21.199 --> 40:23.497
You know, with cards
and then phone calls.

40:23.568 --> 40:29.734
In 10 years, you've gone from breakfast
to greeting cards with this man?

40:29.807 --> 40:31.434
You are pathetic.

40:33.177 --> 40:36.305
You don't think that Colleen would
even have a chance with Gregory?

40:36.380 --> 40:39.008
Men like him require beauty and class.

40:39.417 --> 40:41.817
You mean like Morgan? She had class?

40:41.886 --> 40:44.013
Oh, she had that and much more.

40:44.088 --> 40:45.316
Class?

40:45.389 --> 40:49.325
Morgan was spreading them for Jason
Crick in his trailer behind the garage!

40:49.393 --> 40:51.088
Shut your mouth!

40:51.162 --> 40:56.156
Morgan was the kind of woman that
Gregory could introduce to his peers.

40:56.467 --> 40:58.230
Like Lisa,
the woman that he married.

40:58.302 --> 40:59.792
Yes. Like her.

41:01.773 --> 41:03.502
Like her, Colleen.

41:03.608 --> 41:05.473
A woman with class,
not like you.

41:05.910 --> 41:11.007
Lisa was a slut, a restaurant
hostess who put coke up her crotch.

41:11.082 --> 41:12.674
You call that class, Mom?

41:12.750 --> 41:13.774
You're disgusting.

41:13.851 --> 41:15.580
Yeah,
but she's right.

41:17.421 --> 41:19.753
How did you know what
Lisa did?

41:22.059 --> 41:24.994
'Cause you were online
with her, weren't you?

41:26.664 --> 41:29.861
You sent her the coke
that you mixed with dioxin,

41:30.268 --> 41:32.031
told her what to do.

41:32.603 --> 41:36.130
That's how you knew. That's
the only way you could know.

41:37.141 --> 41:38.369
Oh, God.

41:39.911 --> 41:42.937
It's the only way you
could ever have Gregory.

41:43.481 --> 41:46.314
You're gonna have to
let him go, Colleen.

41:47.185 --> 41:49.210
You know, he's already
put it all on you.

41:49.287 --> 41:52.848
He said that you
killed Lisa and Morgan.

41:52.924 --> 41:54.858
No. Just Lisa.

41:55.293 --> 42:00.162
He killed Morgan.
I know why. I understand.

42:00.231 --> 42:03.325
She didn't love him.
No. Neither of them did.

42:03.868 --> 42:05.165
But I do.

42:05.603 --> 42:07.127
And you just wanted
the chance to show him.

42:07.205 --> 42:08.229
Yes.

42:08.940 --> 42:11.067
I just needed time with him.

42:13.110 --> 42:15.635
Time together.
That's all we needed.

42:16.080 --> 42:19.174
You're under arrest for
the murder of Lisa Ross.

42:19.483 --> 42:21.713
You are such a
disappointment.

42:21.786 --> 42:25.483
Why did you have to give him
to Morgan? You killed her.

42:26.023 --> 42:27.547
It's your fault.

42:27.625 --> 42:28.751
My fault?

42:28.826 --> 42:30.384
I wouldn't have
cheated on him.

42:30.461 --> 42:33.362
Never! He wouldn't have killed me.

42:58.189 --> 43:00.020
He lied to us.

43:00.091 --> 43:01.752
He hired a PI
to follow Morgan.

43:01.826 --> 43:05.284
He knew she was cheating on
him. That nails his motive.

43:05.763 --> 43:07.594
That should do
it for Dr. Ross.

43:07.665 --> 43:10.429
Engaged to one beautiful girl,
married to another.

43:10.501 --> 43:14.028
Each time he must have thought
he'd died and gone to heaven.

43:14.105 --> 43:16.938
Beauty, it's a beast.
