00:02.169 --> 00:04.204
DAVE:
I've never been on tour before,

00:04.204 --> 00:06.440
so, you know, I didn't even know
what to expect,

00:06.440 --> 00:09.776
but I imagined
it would feel like...

00:09.776 --> 00:12.346
freedom, you know?

00:12.346 --> 00:14.448
Like, freedom from having
to create every day.

00:14.448 --> 00:18.752
Freedom from being a prisoner
of my own ambition.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.288
And I could just have
one task every night:

00:21.288 --> 00:23.423
perform my music.

00:23.423 --> 00:25.159
But it's a lot different
making these songs,

00:25.159 --> 00:27.294
like, in my studio by myself.

00:27.294 --> 00:29.263
I mean, every night I'm out
there and I really do, like,

00:29.263 --> 00:30.664
face the music, you know?

00:30.664 --> 00:32.266
I'm seeing the crowd.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.101
And I love my fans, I really do,

00:34.101 --> 00:37.137
but some of them are
ruining it for the rest of them,

00:37.137 --> 00:39.606
because we're at a time
right now

00:39.606 --> 00:42.342
where our country is, like,
eating itself alive,

00:42.342 --> 00:44.444
and I'm up there making jokes

00:44.444 --> 00:47.548
that I don't even know
if I find funny anymore.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.650
A-And, like, on top of that,
every moment

00:49.650 --> 00:52.586
I'm, like, being filmed
and scrutinized,

00:52.586 --> 00:54.788
and, like, if I say
the wrong thing onstage

00:54.788 --> 00:58.025
or do the wrong thing,
who knows what would happen?

00:58.025 --> 01:01.595
A-And I thought this tour was
gonna be, like, me living,

01:01.595 --> 01:05.299
but it really just feels
like I'm surviving.

01:05.299 --> 01:08.569
I need to rebrand
'cause I'm breaking down.

01:08.569 --> 01:12.506
(sighs)
I just can't do it anymore.

01:12.506 --> 01:16.176
So what are you saying?

01:16.176 --> 01:18.412
He's saying he wants to cancel
the rest of the tour.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.984
Yeah.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.166
(Dave sighs)

01:39.166 --> 01:40.667
We'll be okay.

01:40.667 --> 01:43.737
Think about Lincoln.

01:45.305 --> 01:48.242
Everything that he went through.

01:48.242 --> 01:50.377
Stay strong mentally.

01:50.377 --> 01:52.279
'Cause we're gonna
get through this as a unit.

01:52.279 --> 01:55.315
Honestly, I just don't even know
what this doc is anymore.

01:55.315 --> 01:58.018
Like, it feels half-baked
if we're stopping now.

01:58.018 --> 01:59.486
Look, life isn't
all about content, okay?

01:59.486 --> 02:02.055
Everything is content, dawg.

02:02.055 --> 02:04.124
No, Gata,
not everything is content.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.993
I am not content.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.761
I'm not content.

02:07.761 --> 02:10.397
(sighs)
How does Jack Harlow...

02:10.397 --> 02:12.633
How does this guy's followers
go up like this?

02:12.633 --> 02:15.169
- EMMA:
Comparison is the thief of joy.
- (phone chimes)

02:15.169 --> 02:18.172
DAVE:
None of those fucking phrasings
today, okay? Those idioms?

02:18.172 --> 02:20.707
They're ill-kempt. Do I need
to wear this mic anymore,

02:20.707 --> 02:22.376
- now that you're not
interested in...
- EMMA: Who cares?

02:22.376 --> 02:23.710
GATA:
Come on, man.

02:23.710 --> 02:25.646
Okay. 1:58, Dave.
Let's go. We got to go.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.381
- We got to get ready
for this call.
- The call's at 2:00.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.116
- I need the two minutes.
- No, 'cause I need to connect

02:29.116 --> 02:30.751
to the Wi-Fi because there's
no signal out here, Dave.

02:30.751 --> 02:33.053
- Wi-Fi connects instantaneously.
- So we need to be prepared.

02:33.053 --> 02:34.621
- 'Cause they're gonna call
any minute now.
- Look, just let me gather

02:34.621 --> 02:36.390
- my whole...
- I know you want
to cancel your tour

02:36.390 --> 02:37.257
for your mental health,
and I'm here for you, okay?

02:37.257 --> 02:38.292
Bieber did it last year.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.526
It's not that big of a deal.

02:39.526 --> 02:40.661
It's okay.
I love you, all right?

02:40.661 --> 02:42.396
- I'm doing this with you.
- I know.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.697
I love you, too, I just feel
so bad for all my fans

02:43.697 --> 02:45.532
that bought tickets.
I love my fans.

02:45.532 --> 02:47.367
You can't feel bad for the fans.
They're gonna get a full refund.

02:47.367 --> 02:49.069
Plus, your fans would rather
have you happy and healthy.

02:49.069 --> 02:50.437
- (phone ringing)
- I would hope so.
- And look.

02:50.437 --> 02:52.306
- And look. What did I say?
- They're calling.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.241
- And they're early. You're...
- That's why I do what I do.

02:54.241 --> 02:57.544
- You're buttoned up. Hey.
- Yo! You got Mike and Dave.

02:57.544 --> 02:59.112
- Both.
- KEITH (over phone):
Yeah, it's Keith.

02:59.112 --> 03:01.782
Oh, Keith. The big dog.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.650
What do we owe this pleasure
to you-- uh...

03:03.650 --> 03:05.052
- What's up?
- Hi.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.620
Yeah, shut the fuck up.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.388
What you idiots are proposing
is outlandish.

03:08.388 --> 03:10.023
Dave here.
(chuckles)

03:10.023 --> 03:11.992
So, look, I just want you
to know that I really put

03:11.992 --> 03:14.228
a lot of thought into this
decision to cancel the tour.

03:14.228 --> 03:15.762
It's not one I took lightly.

03:15.762 --> 03:18.999
I don't know if you watch
CNN these days, but, like...

03:18.999 --> 03:20.467
the nation is so divided
right now.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.135
- Pretty toxic.
- Yeah.

03:22.135 --> 03:25.072
Again, shut the fuck up
and listen to me.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.540
You have been a thorn
in this label's side

03:26.540 --> 03:28.442
- since we signed you.
- Yeah.

03:28.442 --> 03:31.144
- "Jail"?
- That's a good song still.

03:31.144 --> 03:32.746
The shit in Korea?

03:32.746 --> 03:34.448
Let's just keep
this conversation

03:34.448 --> 03:36.149
purely domestic, if possible.

03:36.149 --> 03:38.318
If we start talking
international issues,

03:38.318 --> 03:40.053
- we're just gonna be
talking for hours.
- Yeah. It's dirty.

03:40.053 --> 03:43.123
You refused to promote
your album at the VMAs.

03:43.123 --> 03:45.692
You did a song with Gator?
Fucking Gator?

03:45.692 --> 03:47.361
It's Gata.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.996
Yeah, it's-- Whoa!

03:48.996 --> 03:50.397
- Whoa! Whoa!
- (metal screeching)

03:50.397 --> 03:53.200
Sorry, folks.
Engine's being frisky, okay?

03:53.200 --> 03:54.768
KEITH:
Am I on speakerphone?
Take me off.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.304
MIKE:
No. Uh, sorry about that, Keith.

03:57.304 --> 04:00.240
Let me-- Hold on, let me
talk to you outside, Keith.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.609
This is the most mismanaged
operation I've ever seen.

04:02.609 --> 04:04.411
You've recouped about 18 grand

04:04.411 --> 04:07.414
out of a $400,000 advance, leaving...

04:07.414 --> 04:09.316
- $382,000.
- Right.

04:09.316 --> 04:11.318
And you've breached contract
more than enough times,

04:11.318 --> 04:13.320
so you will be hearing
from our lawyers.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.122
Whoa.
You're gonna get litigious?

04:15.122 --> 04:17.157
Yes, and to put it
even more simply,

04:17.157 --> 04:20.294
we just don't believe
in this Lil Dicky shit anymore.

04:20.294 --> 04:21.695
(laughs):
Okay.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.401
That is-- that hurts. But...

04:27.401 --> 04:29.203
Look, I understand that, like,

04:29.203 --> 04:31.038
the Lil Dicky thing hasn't
really popped off

04:31.038 --> 04:33.140
the way that we all
would have imagined it would,

04:33.140 --> 04:36.043
but I have a whole plan
to rebrand.

04:36.043 --> 04:38.111
Mike, take me
off speakerphone now.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.614
Hey, Keith. Yeah, okay, l-look,
let us come back with a plan

04:40.614 --> 04:42.649
- to show you that this can be
way more cost-efficient.
- I can't hear.

04:42.649 --> 04:44.151
Okay?

04:44.151 --> 04:45.419
I am going to take care of this.

04:45.419 --> 04:46.753
I can prove to you

04:46.753 --> 04:48.689
this is a-a well-run machine,
you know?

04:48.689 --> 04:50.457
Let-let me show you that we can
get our shit together here.

04:50.457 --> 04:53.393
I promise you, even if it seems
bad now, it's not...

04:55.362 --> 04:57.264
Holy shit!

05:01.235 --> 05:04.071
(softly):
What the fuck?

05:04.071 --> 05:06.206
- What the fuck?
- Cliff.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.576
What in the fuck?!

05:09.576 --> 05:11.411
- Cliff!
- Cliff! Cliff!

05:11.411 --> 05:13.447
Get away from the bus, Dave!
Get away from the bus!

05:13.447 --> 05:15.482
Dave! Dave, get over here!

05:15.482 --> 05:17.618
Get him away from the bus!

05:17.618 --> 05:19.286
Oh, man, it was the rats.

05:19.286 --> 05:22.256
The rats, the wires
down in the undercarriage.

05:22.256 --> 05:23.423
What the fuck are you
talking about, bro?

05:23.423 --> 05:25.225
We could have fucking died.

05:25.225 --> 05:27.227
- All my shit is on there, bro!
- (screams)

05:27.227 --> 05:28.729
- We're alive. We're alive.
- You better ask somebody
about me...

05:28.729 --> 05:32.533
- My fucking laptop!
- My God, we are so lucky.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.102
How much does
a fucking bus cost?

05:35.102 --> 05:36.603
- (moans)
- I ain't worrying
about that shit.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.305
We could have died. Like...

05:38.305 --> 05:41.208
fuck all this
Lil Dicky fucking shit.

05:46.280 --> 05:48.515
Man, this some real Bad Boys
shit right here.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.150
I'm about to get this
on the Story.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.752
IG, look...

05:51.752 --> 05:54.254
Fuck. Ain't no goddamn service.

05:54.254 --> 05:56.323
♪ ♪

06:11.171 --> 06:13.440
MIKE:
There's still no
cell service out here.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.510
Damn, I fucking left
my meds on the bus.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.778
My Adderall was on
that bus, too.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.580
I didn't take
my Adderall today, so...

06:19.580 --> 06:21.481
CLIFF:
This is all y'all's fault.

06:21.481 --> 06:23.584
Y'all left the food that draw
the rats to the food

06:23.584 --> 06:25.285
that caused the explosion.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.020
ELZ:
Cliff, if you don't hurry
the fuck up...

06:27.020 --> 06:29.223
Gata, we have to save that.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.091
Are we really in that type
of situation?

06:31.091 --> 06:33.093
- Yes.
- (scoffs)

06:33.093 --> 06:34.328
I'm trying to cool down, man.

06:34.328 --> 06:35.629
It's hot as a motherfucker
out here.

06:35.629 --> 06:38.966
(birds squawking)

06:51.678 --> 06:53.547
Who's Lil Dicky?

06:55.516 --> 06:57.084
MAN:
I don't know.

06:59.086 --> 07:02.122
But R. I. P., Lil Dicky.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.725
Wait.

07:04.725 --> 07:06.093
What?

07:06.093 --> 07:07.494
Whoa.

07:31.318 --> 07:32.753
- I'm gonna sit in that booth.
- (Emma sighing)

07:32.753 --> 07:36.390
Oh, my God. Got food.

07:36.390 --> 07:38.058
Ugh. I need to wash my hands.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.060
- I'm so dirty.
- EMMA: Oh. (sighs)

07:40.060 --> 07:41.562
Finally, Wi-Fi.

07:41.562 --> 07:44.031
- (groaning)
- Oh, you got the Wi-Fi?

07:44.031 --> 07:46.200
I don't know how the Jews...

07:46.200 --> 07:49.269
did all the fucking traveling
and the wandering.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.205
Hey, will you share
the password, please?

07:51.205 --> 07:53.140
GATA:
I just shared it with you, Mike.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.408
You need to get me water 'cause
I've never been more thirsty.

07:54.408 --> 07:56.343
- (phones chiming)
- Yo. What the fuck?

07:56.343 --> 07:58.745
- Wait. Are you guys seeing this?
- Nah, nah.

07:58.745 --> 08:01.248
WAITER:
What drinks can I get you guys?

08:01.248 --> 08:03.650
- Just give us a minute, please.
- DAVE: What's going on?
- GATA: I mean, bro,

08:03.650 --> 08:05.619
- this shit ain't cool, man.
- EMMA: This is insane.
- Is it another mass shooting?

08:05.619 --> 08:08.522
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude,
dude, dude, dude, dude.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.123
Everyone thinks you're dead.

08:10.123 --> 08:11.458
- Thinks I'm what?
- Dead.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.093
I'm getting
"Sorry for your loss" texts,

08:13.093 --> 08:15.062
I'm getting calls.
I have 90 unanswered texts

08:15.062 --> 08:16.997
that are just like,
"Yo, sorry, bro,

08:16.997 --> 08:18.532
didn't know what was going on,
bro." Like, what the fuck?

08:18.532 --> 08:20.300
MAN (over video):
R. I. P., Lil Dicky.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.102
DAVE:
That's my sex doll legs.

08:22.102 --> 08:25.038
How many Instagram followers
did you have this morning?

08:25.038 --> 08:26.640
Uh... Wait, I don't keep track.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.009
Like 847,000 or something?

08:29.009 --> 08:30.544
Well, you've got
2.9 million now.

08:30.544 --> 08:32.012
No, I don't.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.547
2.9 million in, like,
three hours?

08:33.547 --> 08:35.315
ELZ:
Everybody thinks you're dead.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.150
It's the number one
trending topic on Twitter, bro.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.585
- ELZ: My mom has texted me, bro.
- That's crazy, man.

08:38.585 --> 08:39.753
ELZ:
I don't know
what the fuck to do.

08:39.753 --> 08:42.389
DAVE:
Oh, my God. #RIPLilDicky?

08:42.389 --> 08:44.725
Holy shit. This is exactly
the story I needed.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.593
Okay, I need
the Wi-Fi right now.

08:46.593 --> 08:48.262
- Someone give me the Wi-Fi.
- ELZ: Okay, yeah. I need to...

08:48.262 --> 08:50.164
Dave, can I talk to you
outside for a second?

08:50.164 --> 08:51.532
Yeah, give me a second, I just
want to see what's going on...

08:51.532 --> 08:53.233
EMMA: What are you--
what are you doing?

08:53.233 --> 08:55.068
- No.
- Talk outside,
just for two seconds.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.670
- What are you doing?
Stop messing...
- Real fast.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.405
Outside. Outside. Real fast.
Outside, outside, outside.

08:58.405 --> 08:59.606
- Give me my phone right now.
- Just one minute. Please.

08:59.606 --> 09:01.041

09:01.041 --> 09:02.709
- you always tripping, man.
- I'll go.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.678
Hey, can I have my phone back
so I can tweet to the world

09:04.678 --> 09:06.346
- that I'm not dead, please?
- Yeah, yes, yes,
we can do that.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.348
- We can do that.
- Yeah. Thank you.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.717
Or we don't...

09:10.717 --> 09:13.620
- we don't at all.
- What?

09:13.620 --> 09:15.522
Just-just for a short amount of
time, a little period of time,

09:15.522 --> 09:16.990
- we do nothing.
- I don't understand.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.192
I'm not gonna let people
think I'm dead.

09:18.192 --> 09:19.660
My mom thinks I'm dead.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.161
- My-- Give me the phone.
- Listen. No, no, no, Dave.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.396

- Shh...

09:22.396 --> 09:23.664
- My mom thinks I'm dead.
- Listen. Listen.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.999
Listen to me
for two seconds, please.

09:25.999 --> 09:29.203
Okay, just--
Your streams are up. Way up.

09:29.203 --> 09:31.338
- Give me my phone.
- And I'm talking so way up

09:31.338 --> 09:32.372
that we could recoup
the label's losses--

09:32.372 --> 09:33.540
all of them-- in one day.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.776
- One day?
- I did the math. One day.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.245
This could fix
our entire situation.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.713
If we just play into this
little misunderstanding

09:39.713 --> 09:41.114
just a little bit,
you know, and...

09:41.114 --> 09:42.549
We can't do this, man.

09:42.549 --> 09:44.184
- We're not doing this.
- Elz. Think about Elz.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.385
I mean, he's got pub
on most of those songs.

09:45.385 --> 09:46.620
He produced almost
the whole thing.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.188
He's broke as shit.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.590
GATA:
Trending right now.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.492
On Twitter. Everywhere.

09:51.492 --> 09:53.193
ELZ:
That's crazy.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.295
Or Gata? Gata's streams--
through the roof.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.563
- It's absurd,
what's happening right now.
- Okay, they're not...

10:01.235 --> 10:02.536
I'm gonna deal with the fallout.

10:02.536 --> 10:03.637
It's already fucking trending, dude.

10:03.637 --> 10:04.705
The Internet has it, it's gone.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.406
It-it exists, Dave. You know?

10:06.406 --> 10:08.175
And at some point, you're
gonna come forward and go,

10:08.175 --> 10:10.177
"Hey, I'm not dead, obviously."

10:10.177 --> 10:11.678
- That's gonna be weird,
and that's gonna be...
- No. Because

10:11.678 --> 10:13.413
you didn't control the narrative
in the first place.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.082
You're just saying,
"Hey, I'm not dead, you guys."

10:15.082 --> 10:16.617
And what's the difference
in doing that right now

10:16.617 --> 10:19.353
or tomorrow morning?

10:19.353 --> 10:20.521
It's like...

10:22.055 --> 10:23.323
Y-You're playing with fire
here doing this.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.526
Why? We didn't do anything.

10:25.526 --> 10:27.528
Let's do nothing.

10:27.528 --> 10:30.063
I really wish I was
on my Adderall right now.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.365
This is the first time
in ten years

10:31.365 --> 10:33.100
that I haven't been
on my Adderall.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.334
My brain is not able
to fucking process this shit.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.036
There's a lot of money
coming in.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.405
Let me process it, okay?
That's what I'm here to do.

10:38.405 --> 10:39.473
Do I even want
more attention on...?

10:39.473 --> 10:40.707
I mean, this is the same music

10:40.707 --> 10:42.009
that I just canceled
my tour for,

10:42.009 --> 10:43.310
because I was so ashamed by it.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.511
Why do I want more eyes on that?

10:44.511 --> 10:46.513
I need to do a whole rebrand.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.614
Oh, what--
What's a better rebrand than

10:47.614 --> 10:49.550
coming back from the dead?

10:49.550 --> 10:51.652
This could be huge.

10:51.652 --> 10:55.189
Massive. We just let it drag out
a little bit longer.

10:55.189 --> 10:56.557

- Yes.

16:39.500 --> 16:41.335
Are you telling me

16:41.335 --> 16:44.605
that there's a legitimate shot
at a number one here?

16:44.605 --> 16:46.340
I am telling you
that I've been running

16:46.340 --> 16:48.208
the numbers all day long,

16:48.208 --> 16:50.744
and Penith as an album
and "I'm Drunk" as a single

16:50.744 --> 16:54.114
have a very good chance
of being the number one album

16:54.114 --> 16:57.718
and the number one single
in the country at the same time.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.189
I've told you that the only way
I'm gonna be satisfied in life

17:02.189 --> 17:04.224
- is if I have...
- A number one on
Billboard, I know.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.193
I know it's a really dumb way
to live your life, but I...

17:06.193 --> 17:07.561
No, you want to be acknowledged
at a given point in time

17:07.561 --> 17:09.229
by the industry as the best.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.597
And you'll have achieved
your dream

17:10.597 --> 17:12.566
- and be free.
- And be free.

17:12.566 --> 17:14.334
- I say this all the time?
- A lot, yeah.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.702
But I'm listening.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.304
So what does that mean?

17:17.304 --> 17:19.740
Two more days and then
we get number ones?

17:19.740 --> 17:23.410
(laughs)
Look at me.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.345
But that's lying.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.014
- What's lying?
- That's lying.

17:27.014 --> 17:28.549
If we don't come out and--
Uh, you said-- we agreed

17:28.549 --> 17:30.384
- on tomorrow morning.
- There is no lie to be told.

17:30.384 --> 17:32.319
You didn't say anything,
you didn't do anything.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.687
- I got to look this shit up.
- Dave, you're not
on social media.

17:33.687 --> 17:36.156
You're off the grid.
You're off the grid.

17:36.156 --> 17:37.658
I'm never getting off my phone.

17:37.658 --> 17:39.526
This is the most interesting
content in the world.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.295
- Everyone's talking about me.
- You're gone.

17:41.295 --> 17:43.030
You want to be number one?
You're gone.

17:43.030 --> 17:45.299
- (sighs)
- I got to find a way

17:45.299 --> 17:47.100
to get more radio play,
like, right now.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.569
I'm gonna go get food.

17:48.569 --> 17:50.437
Stay here, don't move.
I'm serious. Please.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.573
I got to sit here
like Anne Frank all night?

17:52.573 --> 17:54.141
You know, you kind of look
like her when you shave. I...

17:54.141 --> 17:55.375
- Oh, my God!
- What?

17:55.375 --> 17:56.677
- What happened?
- Drake.

17:56.677 --> 17:58.512
Drake liked my last tweet.

17:58.512 --> 18:01.448
- Mm. Mm.
- He knows who I am.
I have to DM him.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.517
- No! Dave,
don't-don't do that, Dave.
- I have to respond.

18:03.517 --> 18:05.452
- I'm DMing LeBron!
- Dave! Do you want your dreams
to come true?

18:05.452 --> 18:07.554
- I have to DM these men.
- Do you want your dreams
to come true?

18:07.554 --> 18:09.089
- God!
- Then you got to be
patient, Dave.

18:09.089 --> 18:10.424
You said you want to rebrand.

18:10.424 --> 18:11.992
What better time to think
about a rebrand

18:11.992 --> 18:14.728
than right now,
in this room, by yourself?

18:14.728 --> 18:17.331
Let me do my thing,
you do your thing,

18:17.331 --> 18:19.233
and then the whole world
is gonna be watching

18:19.233 --> 18:20.667
when you decide
to reveal, finally,

18:20.667 --> 18:23.103
who the real Lil Dicky is.

18:24.471 --> 18:25.606
Uh-huh.

18:25.606 --> 18:27.608
(laughs softly)
Okay.

18:27.608 --> 18:30.244
I'm on it.
Good fucking shit, Mike.

18:30.244 --> 18:32.412
(door closes)

18:32.412 --> 18:34.181
(exhales)

18:44.558 --> 18:46.126
(phone chimes)

18:48.529 --> 18:52.065
ROBYN (over phone):
Dave. It's, um,
it's, um, it's me.

18:52.065 --> 18:54.301
It's... it's Robyn. Um...

18:54.301 --> 18:56.403
And...

18:56.403 --> 18:57.738
(sighs)

18:57.738 --> 19:00.207
I can't believe...
(ragged inhale)

19:00.207 --> 19:02.276
Ugh, this is stupid.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.649
(line ringing)

19:08.649 --> 19:10.651
(New York accent):
Hello. Yeah, hi.

19:10.651 --> 19:12.452
(clears throat)
Is this Keith?

19:12.452 --> 19:14.388
Keith, it's Jim Morera.

19:14.388 --> 19:17.224
Yeah, I'm an attorney.
I represent David Burd.

19:17.224 --> 19:19.026
And Mike Spera. Yes.

19:19.026 --> 19:21.128
I know. It's been
a long day over here.

19:21.128 --> 19:23.197
You can imagine how we feel,
you know?

19:23.197 --> 19:24.665
Yeah. Well, crazy thing--

19:24.665 --> 19:26.700
Mike told me about
a conversation you guys had.

19:26.700 --> 19:28.702
Uh, earlier. Prior. Before...

19:29.670 --> 19:31.305
Yeah. No, I know.

19:31.305 --> 19:33.507
I can't imagine
the guilt you're feeling.

19:33.507 --> 19:35.375
Everyone over there, really.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.177
Yeah, no. No, we're praying.

19:37.177 --> 19:39.012
I'm praying. I'm praying myself
that they're missing,

19:39.012 --> 19:42.249
but the likelihood is high
that they were... incinerated.

19:43.383 --> 19:44.484
Uh-huh.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.286
Well, I'm curious to know--

19:46.286 --> 19:49.156
is the label gonna be supporting
Dave's album posthumously?

19:49.156 --> 19:51.158
Uh-huh.

19:51.158 --> 19:52.659
The-the boys said, you know,

19:52.659 --> 19:54.228
there was something about radio, maybe.

19:54.228 --> 19:55.996
That they'd get radio play.

19:55.996 --> 19:57.431
And, um...

19:57.431 --> 20:00.434
Yeah. Well, they never
really felt supported

20:00.434 --> 20:01.702
most of the time.

20:03.337 --> 20:04.571
Keith, let me...

20:04.571 --> 20:06.673
let me call you right back, Keith.

20:13.447 --> 20:15.215
You left these.

20:17.351 --> 20:18.986
Thank you.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.789
They seemed ex pensive.
I didn't want you to lose them.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.625
Thanks.

20:26.460 --> 20:28.295
LD.

20:30.230 --> 20:32.633
What's that stand for?

20:34.034 --> 20:36.470
Uh, Landon Donovan.

20:36.470 --> 20:39.239
Landon Donovan is
an American soccer player.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.308
The U. S. men's team.

20:41.308 --> 20:43.110
Ah.

20:44.077 --> 20:47.314
USA. USA.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.624
♪ ♪

21:06.033 --> 21:07.768
DAVE:
This is all

21:07.768 --> 21:09.403
Here's one you can weigh in on.

21:09.403 --> 21:11.705
MGK-- who I've never even met,
mind you,

21:11.705 --> 21:13.307
so I have no idea
why he's posting about me

21:13.307 --> 21:15.442
in the first place-- wrote,

21:15.442 --> 21:19.146
"I'm so sorry
about what happened in Germany."

21:19.146 --> 21:22.015
What is this guy talking about?
I've never even been to Germany.

21:22.015 --> 21:26.553
Is he just, like, apologizing
in general for the Holocaust?

21:26.553 --> 21:28.689
That's all he wrote?

21:28.689 --> 21:30.157
Yeah.

21:30.157 --> 21:32.125
- Strange.
- Yeah.

21:33.060 --> 21:35.295
"LeBron is listening."

21:35.295 --> 21:37.097
Uh, what is this?

21:37.097 --> 21:39.166
Yeah. Very important.
Got to keep this top of mind.

21:39.166 --> 21:41.435
LeBron is listening.
We got to remember that, it's...

21:41.435 --> 21:43.670
Who is LeBron? Is he a Nazi?

21:43.670 --> 21:44.671
No. No.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.273
Anne, you are safe here.

21:46.273 --> 21:48.408
Uh, LeBron is
actually the opposite of a Nazi.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.544
He's a crusader for justice,
on and off the court.

21:50.544 --> 21:52.179
He's got, like, schools and...

21:52.179 --> 21:54.181
really carries himself well.

21:54.181 --> 21:55.649
He followed me today, so...

21:55.649 --> 21:56.783
it's pretty cool.

21:56.783 --> 21:58.385
He's tracking you?

21:58.385 --> 21:59.419
No. No, no, no.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.154
Following, uh...

22:01.154 --> 22:04.358
Hmm. How do I explain
the Internet to Anne Frank?

22:04.358 --> 22:08.662
So, every fact
that exists in life

22:08.662 --> 22:10.531
can be obtained,

22:10.531 --> 22:12.299
like, through this box.

22:12.299 --> 22:14.168
And through this box,

22:14.168 --> 22:16.036
you can communicate

22:16.036 --> 22:17.771
with everybody...

22:17.771 --> 22:19.673
on Earth, pretty much.

22:22.209 --> 22:24.311
Y-You know, when I was hiding
from the Nazis...

22:24.311 --> 22:26.046
LeBron could unfollow me
at any moment,

22:26.046 --> 22:28.315
which is, like,
a really troubling reality.

22:28.315 --> 22:29.716
And-and that's something
that I need to, like,

22:29.716 --> 22:31.418
keep in mind as well. Because...

22:31.418 --> 22:33.020
I really got to figure out

22:33.020 --> 22:34.288
how I'm gonna get out
of this whole thing.

22:35.322 --> 22:36.323
Get out of...?

22:36.323 --> 22:37.524
This. This entire situation.

22:37.524 --> 22:39.026
Are you kidding?

22:39.026 --> 22:40.027
I was worried
about scrutiny before.

22:40.027 --> 22:41.128
What about now?

22:41.128 --> 22:42.296
I've, like, opened up such a...

22:42.296 --> 22:43.497
I mean, what am I gonna do,

22:43.497 --> 22:45.432
like, go to a park and be like,

22:45.432 --> 22:48.168
"I'm alive"
and hope that goes over well?

22:48.168 --> 22:50.370
Like, I don't think I've even
fucking properly contemplated

22:50.370 --> 22:52.005
my exit strategy.

22:52.005 --> 22:54.007
You know. Fuck.
It's like, what are they gonna--

22:54.007 --> 22:56.143
People are gonna eat me alive, potentially.

22:56.143 --> 22:57.578
Or not. Uh, but,

22:57.578 --> 23:00.347
you know, my life could end
at any moment.

23:02.082 --> 23:04.184
Uh, what I mean by that
is not, like,

23:04.184 --> 23:06.186
end my life in the way
that you were...

23:06.186 --> 23:07.187
clipped.

23:07.187 --> 23:08.722
I mean, like, uh,

23:08.722 --> 23:10.257
today, in America,

23:10.257 --> 23:13.227
they can kill you
while you're alive.

23:13.227 --> 23:15.629
Which, in my opinion,
is worse than being dead.

23:15.629 --> 23:18.532
Although I can't speak to-- I
don't know how you were killed.

23:18.532 --> 23:21.301
How did you die?
Was it, like, a...

23:21.301 --> 23:23.170
- I-In a camp.
- In a camp.

23:23.170 --> 23:25.005
So it was, like, a slow death.
I-I kind of always imagined,

23:25.005 --> 23:27.641
like, people running up and,
like, Osama bin Laden-style,

23:27.641 --> 23:28.775
just, like...
(mimics gunfire)

23:28.775 --> 23:30.544
- Uh, but...
- (claps hands)

23:30.544 --> 23:33.614
Yeah, cancel culture
is a total nightmare.

23:35.148 --> 23:36.583
Yeah, you make coffee in that.

23:36.583 --> 23:37.784
Coffee.

23:37.784 --> 23:40.120
Coffee? No, it's good.

23:40.120 --> 23:42.589
I don't know if you guys
even had stimulants, but...

23:42.589 --> 23:44.224
Did you have Adderall back then?

23:44.224 --> 23:46.260
I'm not on my Adderall.

23:46.260 --> 23:48.428
And it's...

23:48.428 --> 23:50.764
I don't know
if that's why this is happening.

23:50.764 --> 23:52.633
(phone chimes)

23:52.633 --> 23:56.303
Oh, my God. They just added
six of my songs to RapCaviar.

23:56.303 --> 23:58.372
That's 14 million new listeners.

24:00.073 --> 24:01.508
Is that what you want?

24:01.508 --> 24:02.643
Uh, listeners?

24:02.643 --> 24:04.044
Yeah.

24:04.044 --> 24:05.746
Uh, how many listeners
is enough?

24:06.713 --> 24:08.015
Uh...

24:08.015 --> 24:10.117
That's a... big question, Anne.

24:10.117 --> 24:13.120
But, uh, I don't know. You
can really never have too many.

24:13.120 --> 24:15.455
But more listeners you have,

24:15.455 --> 24:17.524
the more scrutiny. Right?

24:17.524 --> 24:20.160
And scrutiny leads to feeling
like everything could just end,

24:20.160 --> 24:21.662
you said. Right?

24:21.662 --> 24:24.565
Very good memory, Ms. Frank.

24:24.565 --> 24:27.134
It was ten seconds ago.

24:27.134 --> 24:28.702
Uh, mm, true.

24:28.702 --> 24:31.538
What is this? Uh, your shirt.

24:31.538 --> 24:32.573
"Whip"?

24:32.573 --> 24:34.107
- Oh.
- What is this?

24:34.107 --> 24:35.576
- Whip. Yeah, whip.
- Whip?

24:35.576 --> 24:37.511
Uh, it's like
a contemporary dance.

24:37.511 --> 24:39.046
It's actually
not even that contemporary.

24:39.046 --> 24:41.048
It's pretty old at this point.
But, uh...

24:41.048 --> 24:43.450
It's like, uh... I normally have
to, like, stand to do it well.

24:43.450 --> 24:45.052
But, uh...

24:45.052 --> 24:46.453
Hey, how did you deal
with all the scrutiny

24:46.453 --> 24:47.788
as far as your diary?

24:47.788 --> 24:49.790
Y-You...

24:49.790 --> 24:51.391
know of my diary?

24:51.391 --> 24:53.360
Oh, my God. Yeah,
everyone knows of your diary.

24:54.328 --> 24:56.029
- Everyone?
- Yeah.

24:56.029 --> 24:57.498
I mean, I don't know
if every single s-- I mean,

24:57.498 --> 24:59.266
it's one of the most popular
books of all time.

24:59.266 --> 25:00.367
(breathing heavily)

25:00.367 --> 25:02.636
Uh, how... how did this happen?

25:02.636 --> 25:04.538
How did it happen? Like,
I don't understand the question.

25:04.538 --> 25:06.173
Like, how did it get published?

25:06.173 --> 25:08.375
Uh, I can-- I'll use the box.

25:08.375 --> 25:10.143
This is the advantage
of the box.

25:10.143 --> 25:11.578
Okay, it says here

25:11.578 --> 25:14.014
that your diary was published
by your father.

25:14.014 --> 25:15.449
Um...

25:15.449 --> 25:17.150
My father published

25:17.150 --> 25:18.652
- my fucking diary?!
- Anne,

25:18.652 --> 25:20.587
nobody came out of the Holocaust
looking better than you.

25:20.587 --> 25:23.590
- (yells)
- Oh! Hey! You came across
really well in the diary!

25:23.590 --> 25:25.092
