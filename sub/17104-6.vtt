-Oh, this is Mia, your
imaginary girlfriend?

-So you met Kat [inaudible]?

00:18.640 --> 00:21.199
If the staff know that if your
friends with her, then you're

00:21.239 --> 00:23.440

seriously.

in primary school

01:36.560 --> 01:39.079
was Stephanie Maxwell.

01:39.120 --> 01:42.799
She had this long, shiny
ponytail and would tease me

01:42.840 --> 01:44.799
because all I had was tangles.

Uh-huh?

01:47.560 --> 01:48.920
Really.

01:48.959 --> 01:51.680
I cried about it to Mom who
said true beauty is in the

01:51.719 --> 01:53.359

01:53.400 --> 01:55.319
She'd obviously never spent
time at the academy.

01:55.359 --> 01:56.560
Hey, Mom.

01:56.599 --> 01:57.760
I'm going to have to
call you back.

02:01.480 --> 02:04.760
To be accepted here, you have
to be in the top 5% of dance

02:04.799 --> 02:07.760

02:07.799 --> 02:10.318
Over the next three years, some
will leave because of

02:10.360 --> 02:15.080
injury; others, because they're
just not good enough.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.159
A few will get tired of working
so hard and just want

02:17.199 --> 02:18.360

contracts with the company.

in a generation that someone

which if you work it out is

02:36.400 --> 02:40.360
like 0.001% of all girls
who do ballet.

02:40.400 --> 02:43.400
So it's statistically
impossible.

02:43.439 --> 02:46.199

But you're always worrying
about being late, so--

Kat's friends.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.159
You didn't want to bring
Abigail, too?

12:10.200 --> 12:12.600
-Uh, well, I would have if it
was four years ago and we were

12:12.639 --> 12:13.919
actually still friends.

12:13.960 --> 12:16.279
But hey, he-he, bonus points
for name recall, Mom.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.639
-Hm, I'm always in so much
trouble with her.

12:18.679 --> 12:20.039
-Me, too.

12:21.879 --> 12:24.799
-Now, tomorrow, I know you're
far too busy to spend time

12:24.840 --> 12:27.080
with your decrepit mother, but
we haven't done anything

12:27.120 --> 12:28.759
together in ages.

12:28.799 --> 12:31.639
-Well, my wardrobe could use
some credit card action.

12:31.679 --> 12:32.639
And I guess if--

12:32.679 --> 12:34.159
-I was more thinking
an early dinner.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.320
I have a matinee in the
afternoon, which I thought--

12:36.360 --> 12:40.600
-Uh, I just remembered that
we have, uh, a thing on.

12:40.639 --> 12:43.679
We have a thing on.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.159
-Well, if you get an opening,
I'll leave your

12:45.200 --> 12:46.399
names on the door.

12:46.440 --> 12:47.600
-Oh, that would be fantastic.

12:59.519 --> 13:03.799
[cellphone rings]

13:03.840 --> 13:05.200
-Sorry, Mom.

13:09.200 --> 13:10.759
-So you guys got along?

13:10.799 --> 13:12.320
-How could you not?

13:12.360 --> 13:13.480
Mia is smart.

13:13.519 --> 13:14.440
She is funny.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.639
And she is way too
hot for you.

13:16.679 --> 13:18.039
-Yeah, she's perfect,
isn't she?

13:21.440 --> 13:24.519
But theoretically, what's
"perfect" when

13:24.559 --> 13:26.320
you get down to it?

13:26.360 --> 13:28.200
-Are you sure you
want Lieberman?

13:28.240 --> 13:29.480
Because I can show you around.

13:29.519 --> 13:30.480
-[giggles]

13:30.519 --> 13:31.679
Positive.

13:34.399 --> 13:35.480
Hey, how was the ballet?

13:35.519 --> 13:37.600
I feel bad Sammy missed
out because of me.

13:37.639 --> 13:38.759
-No, no, no, no, don't.

13:38.799 --> 13:41.360
Uh, as a present to the
reunited lovebirds--

13:41.399 --> 13:42.399
-Hm.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.639
---I got you matinee tickets.

13:43.679 --> 13:45.080
-Aw, thanks, Kat.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.200
That's so sweet.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.159
-Oh, stop it.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.320
-Hey.

13:51.639 --> 13:53.799
-When you die, I'm
having your feet.

13:53.840 --> 13:54.679
-[chuckles]

13:54.720 --> 13:56.159
Uh, it's a genetic gift.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.360
Mom and I are both
double-jointed.

13:57.399 --> 13:58.240
You ready?

13:58.279 --> 13:59.120
Watch it.

13:59.159 --> 14:00.480
Ahem.

14:00.519 --> 14:01.039
Normal?

14:01.080 --> 14:02.440
-Mm-hm.

14:02.480 --> 14:03.759
Aw.

14:03.799 --> 14:06.159
Bones aren't meant
to go that way.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.039
KAT (OFFSCREEN): [laughs]

14:07.080 --> 14:07.840
-What?

14:07.879 --> 14:08.799
-La-la-la-la.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.799
[laughs]

14:15.080 --> 14:17.399
-Something's different.

14:17.440 --> 14:21.799
You got a new training
bra, right?

14:21.840 --> 14:24.519
-You look like someone.

14:24.559 --> 14:26.679
-I think it's sweet you're
trying to copy Natasha.

14:26.720 --> 14:29.240
It's a shame it doesn't do much
for your bone structure.

14:29.279 --> 14:30.679
-I'm not trying to
look like anyone.

14:30.720 --> 14:32.200
Is it illegal to
want to change?

14:37.720 --> 14:40.799
-First Ethan, then
your mother.

14:40.840 --> 14:42.639
Isn't it adorable how your best
friend has a crush on

14:42.679 --> 14:44.600
your entire family?

-[fake giggles]

-Follow, everyone.

up through the sky.

15:07.759 --> 15:09.519
Is something funny, darling?

15:09.559 --> 15:11.799
The rest of us are
trying to work.

15:11.840 --> 15:14.159
Isn't that right, Tara?

15:14.200 --> 15:15.399
Good!

15:15.440 --> 15:16.759
Excellent.

15:16.799 --> 15:18.720
Lovely, lightness.

[cellphone rings]

15:30.639 --> 15:31.840
-Sorry, I'll get out
of your way.

15:31.879 --> 15:33.399
-Actually, I was looking
for you.

15:33.440 --> 15:36.440
-You were?

15:36.480 --> 15:39.240
-I heard you had tickets to this
afternoon's performance.

15:39.279 --> 15:41.159
-Hm?

15:41.200 --> 15:44.799
-I wouldn't usually, you know,
ask, but for some reason, I

15:44.840 --> 15:46.799
haven't been able to source
any, which is really

15:46.840 --> 15:48.799
irritating because it's "Swan
Lake" and that's obviously

15:48.840 --> 15:49.799
something I have to see.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.240
-Hm.

15:52.279 --> 15:52.600
-So?

15:52.639 --> 15:53.840
-Yes.

15:53.879 --> 15:57.600
We can absolutely go to
the ballet together.

15:57.639 --> 15:59.399
-All right.

15:59.440 --> 16:00.720
I'll meet you in the common
room at 3:00.

16:00.759 --> 16:03.360
-OK.

16:03.399 --> 16:08.720
[phone rings]

16:08.759 --> 16:10.320
-Hi.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.159
Yeah, sorry, I didn't hear it.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.039
Uh, listen, about those,
um, those tickets.

16:15.080 --> 16:17.399
They've-- they've
fallen through.

16:17.440 --> 16:18.080
Yeah, and I--

16:18.120 --> 16:20.399
I know it sucks.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.720
Eh, what can you do?

16:22.759 --> 16:23.720
OK.

16:23.759 --> 16:25.240
All right, bye.

16:33.159 --> 16:36.440
Jacket or no jacket?

16:36.480 --> 16:37.799
-[chuckles]

16:37.840 --> 16:42.120
Can nobody dress themselves
around here?

16:42.159 --> 16:43.799
-Sorry, I'm just
a little, euh.

16:43.840 --> 16:47.200
-Aw, you and Mia still
getting nervous?

16:47.240 --> 16:48.519
-Yeah.

16:48.559 --> 16:51.240
-You know, if I wasn't
girl-crushing on her, I'd be

16:51.279 --> 16:52.000
jealous.

16:52.039 --> 16:54.440
-Kat, where have you been?

16:54.480 --> 16:56.480
-Sorry, was I supposed to
give you my coordinates?

16:56.519 --> 16:58.679
-Do you mind if I go
to the Opera House?

16:58.720 --> 17:00.039
We didn't actually have
a thing, did we?

17:00.080 --> 17:03.480
Because, um, Natasha did leave
our names at the door.

17:03.519 --> 17:04.720
-So you'd thought you'd, what?

17:04.759 --> 17:07.799
Go and see if she'll
adopt you?

17:07.839 --> 17:10.160
You know, why don't you rub
her and see if some of her

17:10.200 --> 17:11.640
magic comes off?

17:11.680 --> 17:12.279
-What?

17:12.319 --> 17:13.680
-What?

17:13.720 --> 17:14.839
It's fine, Tara.

17:14.880 --> 17:15.598
Just don't ask my permission
because you're

17:15.640 --> 17:18.240
going to do it anyway.

17:18.279 --> 17:20.118
-I don't get what
the problem is.

17:20.160 --> 17:21.799
Natasha only wants to
spend time with you.

17:21.839 --> 17:22.480
-[chuckles]

17:22.519 --> 17:23.598
Is that a fact?

17:23.640 --> 17:25.039
-Yes.

17:25.079 --> 17:27.160
And if I was lucky enough to
have a mother like yours, I

17:27.200 --> 17:28.279
would make the most of it.

17:28.319 --> 17:30.319
-Ah-ha, stop embarrassing
yourself, Tara.

17:33.279 --> 17:36.160
-Wear the jacket, Sammy.

can't see it?

know, wardrobe malfunction.

Obviously, not for you
because you're--

are we ready?

-Where's Mia?

-Your girlfriend?

-Oh, no, it's just
us two today.

18:07.519 --> 18:10.799

with something.

of blockage.

of you to be concerned.

going to love me.

on the planet, but

19:19.480 --> 19:21.640
Um, thanks for what you
said in class today.

19:21.680 --> 19:25.160
You know that "feeling
like a bird"?

19:25.200 --> 19:26.160
Do you often picture that?

19:26.200 --> 19:26.759
Because I know when
I'm dancing--

19:26.799 --> 19:27.480
[knocks on doors]

19:27.519 --> 19:28.200
---I really feel like--

19:28.240 --> 19:28.720
-5 minutes.

19:28.759 --> 19:29.599
---I'm flying.

19:31.480 --> 19:33.319
-I can't deal with this
right now, could you?

19:33.359 --> 19:34.519
-Come with me, love.

19:41.279 --> 19:42.599
-Don't worry.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.160
The principals just
get a bit twitchy.

19:45.200 --> 19:48.279
-Yeah, they have to focus
on themselves before a

19:48.319 --> 19:49.359
performance.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.240
-Before performance,
after performance.

19:51.279 --> 19:53.799
I've not met one yet who
isn't just a little bit

19:53.839 --> 19:55.160
self-absorbed.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.279
I suppose they have to be.

19:57.319 --> 19:59.640
But Kat would have
told you that.

19:59.680 --> 20:00.400
-Yeah.

20:00.440 --> 20:01.640
She did mention something.

20:21.519 --> 20:24.759
-What's worse than dog poo?

20:24.799 --> 20:27.279
-Maggots in the dog poo.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.279
-Right.

So there's growth between
my toes and--

---burrowing into your skin,
which causes some horrible

you vomit incessantly.

20:52.839 --> 20:54.200
-And that's what I am.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.400
-Worse.

21:04.480 --> 21:08.559
You know, before I went
away, everyone said--

21:08.599 --> 21:12.039
---that we were perfect
together.

21:12.079 --> 21:15.160
I know.

21:15.200 --> 21:16.599
-So is Abigail more perfect
for you than me now?

21:16.640 --> 21:17.799
-No, she's--

21:20.160 --> 21:21.519
she's kind of the opposite.

21:26.839 --> 21:28.359

to do about Kat.

21:51.160 --> 21:52.640
She has potential,
but such a bad

attitude about her dancing.

21:54.519 --> 21:57.640
Did you see that girl before?

21:57.680 --> 22:00.279
The new best friend and the
worst-trained dancer in the

22:00.319 --> 22:01.799
entire academy.

22:01.839 --> 22:04.240
It's like she's trying
to annoy me.

22:04.279 --> 22:06.599
I just wish she'd realize
how lucky she is.

-Hey, Mom.

Do you have time to talk?

-How could you do that?

22:42.559 --> 22:46.839

with Mia in the divorce.

22:46.880 --> 22:51.480
-Hey, Kat, sorry about
yesterday.

22:51.519 --> 22:52.440
I was being insensitive--

22:52.480 --> 22:54.519
---and self-absorbed?

22:54.559 --> 22:56.079
-That, too.

-Cool.

showing you around.

benefit of my experience.

-Yeah, hair appointment.

It's going to take forever
to come out, but I

23:16.880 --> 23:20.400
guess I have time.

-Hm.

a few highlights.

It's what we chase in every
moment of every class.

23:34.720 --> 23:37.519
But sometimes, perfect
isn't what we want.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.359
And sometimes, it can make
us selfish and let

23:42.400 --> 23:44.319
other people down.

23:44.359 --> 23:48.200
Sure, I want to be in
the top 0.001%.

23:48.240 --> 23:52.799
But there's got to be another
way because that's not my idea

23:52.839 --> 23:54.640
of perfection.

23:54.680 --> 23:56.039
Not even close.

24:02.079 --> 24:03.799
