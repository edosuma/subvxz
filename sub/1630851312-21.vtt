WEBVTT

00:06.267 --> 00:09.139
Okay, Tina.
What's your big news?

00:09.313 --> 00:11.663
So, remember back in the day
when I was in that girl group?

00:11.837 --> 00:14.753
Femme Nasty. They were like
Compton's Destiny's Child.

00:16.277 --> 00:17.974
I'm sorry, baby.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.845
No, I'm just excited for you.
Go ahead, go ahead.

00:19.976 --> 00:21.934
Okay. So, there's this TV show

00:22.109 --> 00:24.198
called Are They Still Alive?
And...

00:24.372 --> 00:26.461
Where they bring back
local music groups

00:26.635 --> 00:29.464
and answer the question,
"Are they still alive?"

00:31.988 --> 00:34.469
Please, no, baby, continue.
No, go, go.

00:34.643 --> 00:37.080
Okay, so as I was saying,
well, it turns out that...

00:37.254 --> 00:38.821
They want Femme Nasty
to perform!

00:40.953 --> 00:42.433
Sorry. Calvin told me
last night.

00:42.607 --> 00:45.175
Sorry, Calvin.

00:45.349 --> 00:48.613
Oh, wow, Tina. This is amazing.

00:48.787 --> 00:50.876
So you knew, too?

00:51.007 --> 00:53.227
Sorry,
I suck at lying.

00:54.445 --> 00:56.752
Well, anyway, I'm so excited.

00:56.882 --> 00:59.668
I have not seen Nicki or Janice
since before I had the boys.

00:59.798 --> 01:02.453
Oh, you three were inseparable.

01:02.584 --> 01:05.456
One time, I took Tina out,
and they all came.

01:05.587 --> 01:08.372
It was the most money
I ever spent at a Denny's.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.028
But once our song
hit the charts,

01:12.202 --> 01:14.422
everywhere Femme Nasty went,
our food was free.

01:14.596 --> 01:16.380
Yeah.

01:16.554 --> 01:18.556
You guys really were
Compton's Destiny's Child.

01:18.730 --> 01:20.689
And I bet you were
the Beyoncé.

01:21.690 --> 01:23.257
No, Gemma.

01:23.387 --> 01:25.476
Beyoncé was the me.

01:41.318 --> 01:44.930
God, I am so happy
to see my girls.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.585
How has it been so long?

01:47.759 --> 01:49.544
Oh, to quote the great...The years fly by.

01:49.718 --> 01:51.894
You had kids.
Janice and I moved away.

01:52.068 --> 01:53.896
I went to jail.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.855
You did not go to jail.

01:57.029 --> 01:59.771
I married a pastor,
so basically the same thing.

02:00.946 --> 02:02.992
But now the fellas
are in luck,

02:03.166 --> 02:04.646
because I am single
and ready to...

02:04.776 --> 02:06.517
Run amok?

02:06.648 --> 02:08.476
Sure, we'll go with that.

02:10.217 --> 02:11.870
Well, a lot has
changed for me. I...

02:12.044 --> 02:13.437
All right,
are we singing or what?Let's go.

02:13.611 --> 02:14.873
Ooh, ooh.

02:15.047 --> 02:16.745
Sorry, ladies.
It was kind of hard

02:16.875 --> 02:19.226
to find a tech guy
at the last minute.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.879
How's it going in there?

02:21.053 --> 02:22.838
You're good to go.
But it's gonna cost you

02:23.012 --> 02:24.709
two extra cupcakes
for my overtime.

02:27.756 --> 02:30.454
Y-You know what? It's just
so great seeing you ladies.

02:30.628 --> 02:32.543
You know, I can't remember
why we gave it up.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.676
Well, there were several reasons
why we gave it...

02:34.850 --> 02:37.548
Wait, hold up, hold up.
Something doesn't feel right.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.942
I need you two to
switch positions.

02:40.943 --> 02:42.945
Hurry up. Time is money.

02:43.119 --> 02:45.991
Oh, Janice, please don't slouch.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.865
Hey, uh, did we miss rehearsal?

02:50.039 --> 02:51.997
Sorry, guys. Dave is
somehow your biggest fan.

02:52.172 --> 02:55.218
Ladies, this is Dave and Gemma.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.002
And, uh, sorry, Femme Nasty
rehearsals are closed.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.482
I even kicked Calvin out.

03:00.005 --> 03:01.746
Hold on.
Those were the old rules.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.835
I like being watched.

03:04.836 --> 03:06.708
Okay, let's go.

03:06.882 --> 03:09.450
All right, uh, Gemma, could you
hit the button, please?

03:09.624 --> 03:11.147
Oh. Yeah.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.850
They're so good.

03:21.505 --> 03:24.900
They really connect
with their audience.

03:30.645 --> 03:32.777
Some of the audience.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.084
What?

03:35.258 --> 03:37.521
Grover, what happened?

03:37.695 --> 03:40.916
I was watching the nice lady
dance for Daddy.

03:41.090 --> 03:43.962
Well, it was working
the last time I touched it.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.531
Oh, there's your problem.
It's unplugged.

03:47.705 --> 03:50.534
Oh, my. I wonder
how that happened.

03:50.708 --> 03:53.233
Well, you guys have
a lot of rehearsing to do,

03:53.407 --> 03:54.277
so we're leaving.

03:54.451 --> 03:55.670
We are?

03:55.844 --> 03:57.498
Now, Dave.

04:01.763 --> 04:03.112
He was cute.

04:03.286 --> 04:04.896
Mm, I hope you talking
about Grover.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.507
No, I'm talking about Dave.

04:06.681 --> 04:08.726
That tall glass of milk,
he's got something.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.641
Yeah, it's called
a wife and child.

04:15.298 --> 04:17.648
Okay, everybody.Hey, what's up?

04:17.779 --> 04:20.477
Look, today is a big day
for our boy, Victor Davis.

04:20.651 --> 04:22.000
Who?
Who?

04:23.001 --> 04:24.089
Crackhead Victor.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.482
Oh!

04:25.656 --> 04:26.570
I mean, you could've
just said that.

04:26.744 --> 04:28.355
Look, Victor's out of rehab,

04:28.529 --> 04:30.748
and he's coming back
to start cutting hair again.

04:30.879 --> 04:32.663
Yeah, and if he doesn't
get the support he needs,

04:32.794 --> 04:35.666
he could go right back to
sleeping in your cars.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.278
Or impersonating you at the gym
so he can use their showers.

04:38.452 --> 04:40.236
Yeah, or stealing
your Amazon packages

04:40.410 --> 04:41.716
and then trying to
sell them back to you.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.152
Oh, hey.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.589
That's all in the past,
all right?

04:45.763 --> 04:47.809
Now, Victor needs all
of our help to move forward.

04:47.983 --> 04:50.159
Yeah, and I don't want him
to slide back into addiction

04:50.333 --> 04:52.553
after how hard he's worked,
so I've convinced Que

04:52.683 --> 04:55.033
to let him rent a chair until
he gets back on his feet.

04:55.207 --> 04:57.601
Now... okay, now,
here he comes.

04:57.775 --> 04:59.560
Everybody, let's give
him a warm welcome.

05:01.823 --> 05:03.303
Hey, everybody!Hey, Vic.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.350
Hey, Vic, man.

05:07.524 --> 05:08.960
How you doing?
You ready to get started?

05:09.134 --> 05:10.614
Yeah. I'm a little nervous.

05:10.788 --> 05:12.050
It's been a minute
since I've cut someone.

05:12.224 --> 05:13.487
Their hair, I mean.

05:14.792 --> 05:16.533
Uh, yeah, you know,
we might want

05:16.707 --> 05:18.361
to start you out on clippers.

05:20.581 --> 05:21.799
All right, everybody,
I'm out of here.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.932
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Pop, where you going?Dad?

05:24.106 --> 05:25.977
To the ballet, Malcolm.

05:27.805 --> 05:29.720
Look, I got six cars
waiting for me at the shop.

05:29.851 --> 05:30.634
Y'all got this.

05:32.462 --> 05:35.117
All right. Guys,
let's support our neighbor.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.423
Who's up first?

05:36.597 --> 05:38.773
Marty?

05:38.947 --> 05:40.992
Uh, listen.
Necie loves my hair long,

05:41.166 --> 05:43.995
and I love Necie, so no.

05:45.519 --> 05:48.435
Okay. Uh, Malcolm,
ready to jump in there?

05:48.609 --> 05:51.176
Uh, you know,
I would, Dave, but, uh,

05:51.307 --> 05:54.136
with my delicate hairline,
brother, I can't take any risks.

05:55.964 --> 05:57.139
You do it, Dave.

05:57.313 --> 05:58.793
You're married with a kid.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.708
Nobody cares how you look.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.015
All right. No problem.

06:04.189 --> 06:06.235
I trust Victor.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.846
I supervised craft time
at the VA, and his...

06:09.020 --> 06:11.762
his paper snowflakes
were transcendent.

06:13.068 --> 06:14.330
All right, Vic, let's do this.

06:14.461 --> 06:16.506
One micro-trim, please.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.510
Oh!

06:33.784 --> 06:35.743
Vic, I love it.

06:35.917 --> 06:38.920
You know, I was just saying
the other day that I wish...

06:39.094 --> 06:41.270
wish I could see more scalp,
and now I can.

06:41.444 --> 06:42.750
Okay.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.079
Vic, go that way!
Go that way!

07:08.253 --> 07:10.081
Ma'am, no, we can fix it!
We can fix it!

07:20.352 --> 07:22.790
W-W-Wait, wait, wait.
Little man, I-I can fix it.

07:25.053 --> 07:27.490
Looks like little man
is moving on up.

07:28.839 --> 07:30.624
I pray that little boy
is homeschooled.

07:31.886 --> 07:33.322
All right, you know what?
Don't worry.

07:33.496 --> 07:35.237
Hair, it always grows back.

07:35.411 --> 07:36.630
You better hope so.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.942
Okay, Gemma, check me out.

07:48.119 --> 07:51.340
They are never gonna forget
you're alive after tonight.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.342
Aw. Thank you.

07:53.516 --> 07:55.257
You know what,
I'm really enjoying

07:55.431 --> 07:57.346
reconnecting with my girls.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.217
You know, I even
rearranged the song,

07:59.348 --> 08:01.089
I redid our choreography,

08:01.219 --> 08:03.265
and I rehearsed them
to perfection.

08:03.439 --> 08:05.397
Aw. Great.

08:05.572 --> 08:08.226
But Nicki better not go
all "Private Dancer"

08:08.400 --> 08:10.577
on Dave again, or I might
have to give her

08:10.751 --> 08:13.231
a Hickory Corners
"how do you do?"

08:16.147 --> 08:17.540
Okay.

08:19.368 --> 08:21.936
Well, you know,
Nicki can be a lot,

08:22.110 --> 08:24.721
but don't worry,
she's harmless.

08:24.895 --> 08:27.158
Unlike these boots.

08:27.332 --> 08:29.334
Damn it.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.423
Malcolm should've delivered
that cupcake order an hour ago.

08:31.598 --> 08:33.034
You know, I'm just
gonna see if he's home.

08:33.164 --> 08:34.731
I got to go, too.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.211
Oh, shouldn't you get out
of your costume first?

08:36.385 --> 08:37.908
Girl, I'm wearing
three pairs of Spanx.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.954
I'm in this costume
till you cut me out of it.

08:47.352 --> 08:48.876
Malcolm?

08:52.357 --> 08:54.577
Clothes all over the place.

08:54.751 --> 08:56.666
Music blasting.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.363
I raised these boys
better than this.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.496
Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.632
I guess somebody must be busy.

09:09.244 --> 09:10.941
I know that laugh.

09:14.075 --> 09:15.076
Nicki?

09:15.250 --> 09:17.121
Tina?
Mama?

09:17.295 --> 09:18.732
Mama?!

09:20.342 --> 09:22.736
Oh, hell no!

09:31.527 --> 09:33.834
Mama!Tina, listen.

09:34.008 --> 09:35.183
I had no idea.

09:35.313 --> 09:36.445
Look, Ma, it's true, okay?

09:36.619 --> 09:38.273
We met the other
night at Ernie's,

09:38.447 --> 09:40.014
and one thing
led to another.

09:40.188 --> 09:42.494
But I swear I didn't recognize
her from your old photos.

09:42.669 --> 09:45.454
Well, obviously--
she looks much older now.

09:46.455 --> 09:47.804
No, you didn't.

09:47.978 --> 09:49.110
Yes, I did.

09:49.284 --> 09:51.808
Tina, this was just
an innocent hookup

09:51.982 --> 09:53.549
between two consenting adults.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.160
Malcolm is not just any adult.

09:56.334 --> 09:58.075
He's my baby.

09:58.249 --> 10:01.122
So whatever this is, it's over.

10:01.296 --> 10:03.864
Uh, wait a minute, Ma.Wait, you can't
tell us what to do.

10:04.038 --> 10:06.301
Right.If we want to keep seeing
each other, we will.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.999
Hell, if we want to run off
and get married, we will.

10:09.130 --> 10:11.262
Uh, who is "we"?

10:11.436 --> 10:13.134
You know what, Nicki?

10:13.308 --> 10:14.614
You're right.

10:14.788 --> 10:16.311
We're all adults.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.008
We can do whatever we want.

10:18.139 --> 10:20.924
Like, if I want to cancel
our show tonight, I can!

10:21.098 --> 10:23.100
You can't cancel our show.

10:23.231 --> 10:25.320
Just because your bossy ass
used to tell us what to do

10:25.494 --> 10:26.669
doesn't mean you still can.

10:26.843 --> 10:29.585
Where do you get off
calling me bossy?

10:29.759 --> 10:31.500
That's the reason
we broke up, Tina.

10:31.674 --> 10:34.459
You were a control freak then,
and you're a control freak now.

10:34.590 --> 10:36.200
Ah, oh, well,
you're just a freak.

10:36.374 --> 10:38.463
Oh.

10:38.594 --> 10:41.597
Well, this freak is performing
tonight with or without you.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.862
She dipped on me.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.259
What were you thinking?

10:51.433 --> 10:53.043
I don't know, Ma.

10:53.174 --> 10:55.393
But, uh, whatever it was,
just trust me,

10:55.524 --> 10:57.265
I will not be thinking it again.

11:16.240 --> 11:19.853
Whoa, man. You never sneak up
on a former crackhead.

11:21.593 --> 11:22.986
We were just coming
to check in on you.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.161
How you doing, Vic?

11:24.335 --> 11:26.120
The haircut was that bad, huh?

11:27.991 --> 11:31.125
No. Come on. Can a haircut
ever really be bad?

11:31.299 --> 11:32.996
Yeah. Yeah.

11:33.170 --> 11:34.606
Yours.

11:34.781 --> 11:37.087
Well, it's okay, it's okay.
I know I messed up.

11:37.218 --> 11:39.568
Hell, I made a little boy
look like George Jefferson.

11:41.222 --> 11:42.919
Obviously, this ain't
gonna work out.

11:43.093 --> 11:45.748
Whoa, hold on, Vic.
That's not true. Look.

11:45.879 --> 11:48.316
Everyone needs a
practice swing.

11:48.446 --> 11:49.926
Or three.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.494
Look, but we are not
gonna let you quit.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.104
You have come too far.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.324
Yeah, man,
you cannot be a quitter.

11:56.454 --> 11:59.414
Uh, uh, with-with this,
specifically.

11:59.588 --> 12:02.025
Uh, it's totally okay to...
to quit crack.

12:03.635 --> 12:05.463
I just feel like everybody's
just watching

12:05.594 --> 12:08.075
and waiting for me to mess up.

12:08.249 --> 12:11.208
Well, you just need to find
a way to block that out.

12:11.339 --> 12:13.558
You know, find a way
to get into your own world.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.039
You know what, Vic?

12:16.213 --> 12:18.346
Just give it one more day.
I've got a plan.

12:18.476 --> 12:19.739
Okay, but you're not
gonna make us do

12:19.913 --> 12:21.262
any more trust falls again,
are you?

12:21.436 --> 12:23.003
'Cause we did enough of that
at the VA.

12:24.047 --> 12:26.049
No, that is not the plan.

12:26.223 --> 12:29.009
God, you know,
you drop a guy one time,

12:29.183 --> 12:32.055
and suddenly everyone
hates trust falls.

12:37.669 --> 12:39.933
Can't believe Nicki
would betray me like that!

12:41.282 --> 12:43.153
Hell, I may be taking my life

12:43.284 --> 12:45.155
into my own hands here,
but, uh...

12:46.678 --> 12:48.811
...technically, she didn't know
she betrayed you.

12:48.985 --> 12:50.639
She didn't know who Malcolm was.

12:50.813 --> 12:52.641
But when she found out,

12:52.815 --> 12:54.382
she said that
she was gonna keep on

12:54.512 --> 12:55.992
dating him
if she wanted to!

12:59.082 --> 13:01.519
But, babe, I'm sure she
said that because she was mad.

13:01.693 --> 13:04.696
I mean, you used to love Nicki
for being a feisty free spirit.

13:04.871 --> 13:07.525
Well, that was before she
free-spirited all over our son.

13:07.699 --> 13:11.051
You know, I was so excited
about getting back together,

13:11.225 --> 13:12.443
and she just ruined it.

13:12.617 --> 13:13.749
Tina...

13:13.880 --> 13:15.664
You know, she had the nerve

13:15.838 --> 13:17.492
to call me a control freak.

13:17.666 --> 13:20.495
Said that we broke up
because I have opinions.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.018
Well... I mean, well, baby,

13:22.192 --> 13:24.020
you know, back in the day,
you were one

13:24.194 --> 13:25.413
to definitely...

13:28.111 --> 13:29.765
Are you taking her side?

13:31.158 --> 13:33.682
'Cause it sounds to me
like you're taking her side.

13:36.859 --> 13:38.556
Of course not.

13:38.730 --> 13:40.210
Why would I be taking her side

13:40.341 --> 13:42.256
when, clearly, you're the one
who's right here?

13:45.215 --> 13:47.087
Hey, y'all. Mama, can we talk?

13:47.261 --> 13:49.350
Well, you know what?

13:49.524 --> 13:51.526
I'm gonna let y'all
have at it, all right?

13:51.700 --> 13:53.833
But, uh, safety first.

14:00.927 --> 14:03.320
Mama, I'm sorry
we upset you.

14:03.494 --> 14:04.974
But even though
you're mad at Nicki...

14:05.932 --> 14:07.890
...you're mad at us...

14:09.761 --> 14:10.893
...you should still do
the show tonight.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.504
Now, why would I do that?

14:13.678 --> 14:15.071
Uh, because it might be
the last time

14:15.245 --> 14:16.725
you get to perform
with Femme Nasty.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.466
You can't miss that.

14:18.596 --> 14:21.599
And I was so looking forward
to hitting that stage again.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.732
Exactly. And you always said

14:23.906 --> 14:26.126
you loved performing
with Janice and Nicki.

14:26.256 --> 14:28.606
Not everybody gets a chance
to relive their dreams.

14:30.260 --> 14:32.262
So what you're saying is
I shouldn't let

14:32.393 --> 14:36.049
Nicki's cradle-robbing ass
steal all the glory.

14:36.223 --> 14:38.529
Th-That's...
that-that is not what I said.

14:38.703 --> 14:40.183
Th-That's... that...
th-that's what I heard.

14:49.105 --> 14:51.499
Whew. Still pitchy.

14:51.629 --> 14:53.675
Good to know nothing's changed.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.939
You're right.
I can't hit that

14:57.113 --> 14:58.767
self-righteous note
you do so perfectly.

14:58.941 --> 15:01.291
C-Can I...
can I just say one thing?

15:01.465 --> 15:02.858
Yeah, but I don't know why
you're screaming, though.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.862
Ever since we got started...

15:06.993 --> 15:09.778
Ladies, you're on in two.

15:09.952 --> 15:12.433
It is time for me to greet
my adoring fans.

15:12.607 --> 15:14.217
You mean the ones
who came to see me?

15:14.391 --> 15:16.306
Can't we just get along?Janice, please!

15:16.480 --> 15:18.265
Look, for somebody so quiet,
you sure do talk a lot.

15:34.977 --> 15:37.937
Oh, my gosh, don't
they look great?

15:38.111 --> 15:40.417
You better not
answer that.

16:11.796 --> 16:16.018
Wow, it... it's like
she's singing just to me.

16:18.368 --> 16:21.023
You better hope not, buddy,
or we're going home.

16:22.503 --> 16:24.809
Don't tell Mom,
but between you and me,

16:24.984 --> 16:27.029
I totally get it.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.946
Brother, you don't even know.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.688
Come on.

16:33.862 --> 16:35.951
It's like she's singing
just to me.

16:36.952 --> 16:39.302
Uh, look away,
little man.

16:39.476 --> 16:41.739
You don't want the drama
that comes with that.

16:53.273 --> 16:55.710
Ooh.

17:04.936 --> 17:08.201
Oh!It is always the quiet ones.

17:12.335 --> 17:14.294
Thank you! Thank you!

17:15.773 --> 17:17.514
Oh, my God.

17:17.688 --> 17:20.474
Femme Nasty
is still nasty.

17:20.648 --> 17:22.563
Oh, God,
I hate to admit it,

17:22.693 --> 17:24.652
but you were amazing.

17:24.782 --> 17:27.698
And I hate to admit it more,
but so were you.

17:29.439 --> 17:31.528
Oh, it felt good
out there.

17:31.702 --> 17:33.487
Yeah, it did.

17:34.792 --> 17:36.142
I promise
I'll come back.

17:36.316 --> 17:37.752
Janice!

17:37.926 --> 17:39.710
I mean, come on,
who knew you had it in you?

17:39.884 --> 17:41.277
Well, that's
because y'all two

17:41.451 --> 17:43.497
never shut up and
let me get a note in.

17:43.671 --> 17:46.935
Now, y'all need to grow up
and work this thing out.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.284
I'm gonna go talk
to my fans, okay?

17:48.458 --> 17:52.071
Okay. Okay.
Oh, I'm back! Hey!

17:53.333 --> 17:55.378
Whew.

17:55.552 --> 17:56.945
Tina...

17:57.119 --> 17:59.817
I am truly sorry
about all of this.

17:59.991 --> 18:02.342
Yeah. I'm sorry, too.

18:02.472 --> 18:04.648
Partly my fault for making
such a good-looking son.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.302
You sure did.

18:06.476 --> 18:08.391
Hey.

18:08.565 --> 18:09.740
Careful there.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.961
You know, Nicki,
you were right.

18:14.789 --> 18:18.575
You know, I was bossy
when we were coming up, and...

18:18.706 --> 18:21.012
I'd just hate to think that
that was the reason we broke up.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.276
Tina, there were
a lot of reasons.

18:23.406 --> 18:25.800
Yeah, didn't you sleep
with our manager?

18:25.974 --> 18:28.107
Like I said, there were
a lot of reasons.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.024
But we are all exactly
where we should be.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.157
Could you imagine us
being on tour right now?

18:35.331 --> 18:38.117
Ooh, girl, no.
I go to sleep at15.

18:40.162 --> 18:43.209
Well, hopefully, we don't
have to be in a group

18:43.383 --> 18:45.080
to be friends again.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.474
Nicki, we never stopped
being friends.

18:47.648 --> 18:49.128
Give me some.

18:49.302 --> 18:51.521
Girl, girl, give me some.

18:55.656 --> 18:58.441
Now that we have
that behind us,

18:58.615 --> 19:01.096
what's up with Marty?Girl, I will stab you.

19:03.968 --> 19:05.579
You better stop playing.

19:10.888 --> 19:12.977
Do you like it?

19:13.108 --> 19:14.327
Hell no, I don't like it.

19:15.676 --> 19:16.894
Man, I love it.

19:17.808 --> 19:19.680
Okay.
Yes!

19:19.854 --> 19:22.639
Man, I look like
the old Steve Harvey.

19:25.207 --> 19:27.035
Aw, man, yo,
I do not get it.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.124
How did Vic make Pop
look like a GQmodel

19:29.298 --> 19:31.344
and Dave look like an
unsupervised toddler?

19:34.477 --> 19:36.175
Man, you've got to love Prince.

19:36.349 --> 19:38.742
I'm cutting hair like it's 1999.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.440
Thanks, Dave.

19:40.614 --> 19:41.919
You were right.
These things really do work.

19:42.093 --> 19:43.704
It was like I was
in my own world.

19:43.878 --> 19:45.532
Yeah, man.
You know, down at the VA,

19:45.706 --> 19:47.098
whenever you needed space,
you listened to music,

19:47.273 --> 19:48.230
so I thought those might help.

19:48.404 --> 19:49.666
Yeah, it was great.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.059
No kids were harmed today.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.583
Kids were harmed another day?

19:54.889 --> 19:58.197
Uh... I don't think you want
to ask that question.

19:58.371 --> 20:00.024
You know what?

20:00.155 --> 20:02.157
Y'all really believed in me
when I didn't.

20:02.331 --> 20:04.028
Dave, to thank you,
I'm gonna fix

20:04.203 --> 20:06.640
that busted-up cut I gave you.

20:06.814 --> 20:08.250
What busted-up cut?

20:08.381 --> 20:09.469
Uh, Daddy, no, Dad-Daddy, no...No, no, no.

20:09.643 --> 20:10.557
No, Daddy, don't!

20:14.169 --> 20:16.476
Victor carved Dave up
like a jack-o'-lantern,

20:16.650 --> 20:18.391
and y'all let me sit
in his chair?

20:21.132 --> 20:22.743
All three of y'all
are out of my will.

20:22.873 --> 20:24.223
Daddy, come on, man!

20:24.397 --> 20:25.746
I didn't know he
was gonna do that.

20:25.876 --> 20:27.748
I was in the will?

20:27.922 --> 20:30.316
Calvin!
What was I gonna get?

20:39.238 --> 20:42.371
and TOYOTA.
