WEBVTT

01:35.304 --> 01:36.782
Not happening, Ro.

01:36.806 --> 01:38.033
Sis, please.

01:38.057 --> 01:39.660
I said no, and I meant it.

01:39.684 --> 01:42.495
Seriously?
I'm 16, not five.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.205
I don't know these kids.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.582
And I need you to take Mary
to dance class on Friday.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.334
I've got two clients
for a color and cut.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.879
Yeah, you always have clients.

01:50.903 --> 01:53.048
How do you think I pay
for your baseball equipment?

01:53.072 --> 01:54.717
Okay, do you think money
grows on trees?

01:54.741 --> 01:56.259
That's fine. I'll just be
the laughing stock

01:56.283 --> 01:57.326
of all the juniors.

01:59.161 --> 02:01.932
Look.
I'm sorry, Ro.

02:01.956 --> 02:03.726
We need the money.

02:03.750 --> 02:06.477
I'm two years behind
on property taxes.

02:06.501 --> 02:09.355
The bills keep coming in.

02:09.379 --> 02:12.299
Maybe we should start thinking
about selling Dad's Mustang.

02:14.969 --> 02:16.529
It would solve
a lot of problems.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.489
We're not selling Dad's car,
all right?

02:18.513 --> 02:19.908
I won't go to the stupid party.

02:19.932 --> 02:21.617
It's no biggie, really.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.747
It's not stupid to want
to hang out with your friends.

02:24.771 --> 02:26.749
Hey, maybe I can move
my appointments?

02:26.773 --> 02:28.876
No, I mean, I've already started
looking at other jobs, so...

02:28.900 --> 02:31.627
Your job is to keep
a grade-A average

02:31.651 --> 02:34.213
and to get into a good college
on scholarship.

02:34.237 --> 02:37.009
You can't keep working
yourself to the bone.

02:37.033 --> 02:39.594
I'm fine.

02:39.618 --> 02:41.304
We've been going
strong for three years now.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.098
Why change it?

02:43.122 --> 02:45.433
Maybe it's because you haven't
been with a friend

02:45.457 --> 02:47.811
or on a date since...

02:47.835 --> 02:50.898
I can't even remember the last
time I've seen you with a guy.

02:50.922 --> 02:52.941
I see guys all the time.

02:52.965 --> 02:55.425
Yeah, your yoga class?
It doesn't count.

02:57.386 --> 02:58.706
Take care of yourself out there.

02:59.722 --> 03:01.075
You can count on it.

03:01.099 --> 03:02.658

- Oh, wait, wait.

Your shirt's on backwards.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.580
Arms up.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.540
Good morning, San Francisco.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.878
Let's talk baseball,
specifically Trent Fox.

03:12.902 --> 03:15.338
It's been a few weeks since
the bad boy hitter

03:15.362 --> 03:16.381
from the Ports
tore his hamstring

03:16.405 --> 03:19.134
in the last game of the season.

03:19.158 --> 03:21.302
The injury doesn't
seem to have stopped him.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.805
Brian?

03:22.829 --> 03:23.806
Well, Gerry,
there are those who say

03:23.830 --> 03:25.515
Trent Fox hasn't peaked.

03:30.585 --> 03:33.439
Wake up, you piece of shit.

03:33.463 --> 03:34.506
Ross?

03:36.675 --> 03:37.903
What are you doing here?

03:37.927 --> 03:39.612
Six weeks of
recuperation, Trent,

03:39.636 --> 03:41.115
and this is what you have
to show for it?

03:41.139 --> 03:42.407
You living in filth, man.

03:42.431 --> 03:44.118
Drinking? Smoking?

03:44.142 --> 03:45.618
Have you even gone
to therapy yet?

03:45.642 --> 03:46.995
Ross, of course I have.

03:47.019 --> 03:48.579
Three days a week.

03:48.603 --> 03:50.665
Three other days
I lift weights with Clay.

03:50.689 --> 03:54.002
Are you supposed
to be lifting weights. Huh?

03:54.026 --> 03:56.839
What about strengthening,
flexibility, stretching?

03:56.863 --> 03:59.424
Doc recommended daily
yoga classes for you, Trent.

03:59.448 --> 04:04.179
You have got to
snap out of it, kid.

04:04.203 --> 04:05.889
I mean, is this what
you do with your time?

04:05.913 --> 04:07.515
Hell, I'm surprised
you have one of your little

04:07.539 --> 04:09.792
girlfriends up in here warming
your bed right now.

04:13.171 --> 04:14.172
Really?

04:15.297 --> 04:16.274
Maybe.

04:16.298 --> 04:19.485
Shit.
Unbelievable.

04:19.509 --> 04:23.489
It's always the talented
ones, too.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.409
Pills, liquor

04:26.433 --> 04:29.103
and endless fucking women.

04:30.729 --> 04:31.790
What else, Trent?

04:31.814 --> 04:34.584
What the hell else?
Huh?

04:34.608 --> 04:37.004
I don't owe you
any explanations.

04:37.028 --> 04:38.629
I'm on medical leave.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.215
The hell you don't!

04:40.239 --> 04:42.258
The way I see it,
you got one of two choices.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.929
Either get your shit together
or lose your contract.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.680
And with the way
that you've been hitting,

04:47.704 --> 04:51.291
you're looking at an offer
of 100 mil for five years.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.480
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

04:55.504 --> 04:57.941
Jesus.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.861
Look, man.

05:00.885 --> 05:03.529
Coach wants you ready

05:03.553 --> 05:05.866
I'll lay off the booze
and the late nights.

05:05.890 --> 05:09.410
And you'll go to the therapy
and the yoga.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.872
Yoga? Come on.

05:11.896 --> 05:14.166
Trent, you will go to a class

I'm here for rehabilitation.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.487
Pulled hamstring, right?

06:26.511 --> 06:28.447
Torn.

My brother is a huge Ports fan.

too much pressure
on the hamstring.

Could we do that again,
privately?

Private classes?

Oh, well, if you can pay,

now and determine

14:01.592 --> 14:03.318
a routine that will help
loosen your limbs, okay?

14:03.342 --> 14:04.612
Okay.

14:04.636 --> 14:05.845
All right.

14:07.598 --> 14:09.451
♪♪

14:09.475 --> 14:12.185
Push it in as far as...

14:18.316 --> 14:19.835
Now, I want you to take your
right thumb

14:19.859 --> 14:22.571
and put it on left nostril
and inhale. Okay.

14:40.922 --> 14:43.610
Ah...

14:43.634 --> 14:45.218
Ooh.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.644
Okay, let's stretch.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.317
Other side.

15:09.535 --> 15:12.704
Come over and open your legs
as wide as you can.

15:31.515 --> 15:33.642
You know how ridiculously
beautiful you are?

15:35.434 --> 15:36.995
Other side.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.564
Okay.

15:40.816 --> 15:42.417
Right here.
Yeah.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.528
- Oh, much better.
- Good.

15:49.115 --> 15:52.619
Whatever it is you do,
you gotta keep doing it.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.973
Like a Voodoo healer.

15:55.997 --> 15:59.208
I don't practice magic
or voodoo of and kind.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.400
Okay, um...

16:06.424 --> 16:07.509
Now you...

16:18.812 --> 16:19.997
Are you going to tell me

16:20.021 --> 16:22.457
about the hotshot
baseball player?

16:22.481 --> 16:24.084
He's nicer than I thought
he would be

16:24.108 --> 16:28.255
for someone who has websites
dedicated to his body.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.031
I mean, most women
think he's hot.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.720
But what do you think?

16:33.744 --> 16:35.304
Every time I'm around him,

16:35.328 --> 16:39.266
I turn into a lust driven teen.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.310
There are worse things.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.979
I'm supposed to be helping
him recover through yoga.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.900
And half the time
I'm checking him out.

16:46.924 --> 16:48.400
So what are you going
to do about it?

16:48.424 --> 16:49.944
Nothing.

16:49.968 --> 16:52.112
He's a client.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.865
Vivy, you know, you really...

16:53.889 --> 16:56.200
No, no, listen,
it's not going to work

16:56.224 --> 16:59.494
unless I just want
to have casual sex,

16:59.518 --> 17:04.374
which, incidentally,
is what Luna suggested.

17:04.398 --> 17:07.002
Well, it's been three years
since the breakup,

17:07.026 --> 17:10.422
so maybe you should.

17:10.446 --> 17:15.052
This coming from the girl
who's all study, no dating.

17:15.076 --> 17:18.180
Does it feel right to you?

17:18.204 --> 17:23.101
It feels like something
I just don't know what.

17:23.125 --> 17:26.521
- Trent Fox.
- Trent Fox.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.983
Trent Fox? Are you guys
talking about Trent Fox?

17:29.007 --> 17:31.068
That's my freaking idol.

17:31.092 --> 17:33.153
Go back inside.
I'll be in there soon. Okay.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.280
Why? Ambers here.

17:35.304 --> 17:38.283
Hey, Row, Trent's your sister's
new private client.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.744
- Amber.
- What?

17:39.768 --> 17:41.996
Vivy, you have got to
introduce me to him.

17:42.020 --> 17:44.373
Please. I'll do anything.
I'll even mow the lawn.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.083
You already mow the lawn.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.734
Come on, please.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.129
Okay. Maybe after a lesson,

17:51.153 --> 17:54.466
we can invite him for
a treat on us at the bakery.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.678
No promises.

17:56.702 --> 17:58.972
- And you need a haircut.
- I don't.

17:58.996 --> 18:00.765
But you're the best sister ever.

18:00.789 --> 18:02.182
I got to make dinner.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.101
Something special for
my awesome sister.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.520
See ya, Amber.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.272
You know, it's
his night to cook.

18:08.296 --> 18:09.983
- Oh, of course.
- Yeah.

18:10.007 --> 18:11.566
Yeah.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.573
Um. Okay.

18:18.597 --> 18:20.618
Hold that pose until I tell you
to go into child's pose, okay?

18:20.642 --> 18:21.852
Okay.

18:35.531 --> 18:36.634
Viv, what's the matter?

18:36.658 --> 18:37.993
Child's pose.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.389
You're acting weird.

18:42.413 --> 18:44.182
Did I do something to offend?

18:44.206 --> 18:46.060
No, not at all.

18:46.084 --> 18:48.484
You've been more focused today
than you have been all week.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.506
I was just wondering...

18:54.467 --> 18:56.135
If...

18:58.722 --> 19:00.324
Go ahead.

19:00.348 --> 19:02.827
Well, you can totally say no,
but I was wondering

19:02.851 --> 19:06.021
if I could take you for coffee.

19:07.438 --> 19:10.752
Genevieve, are you
asking me out on a date?

19:10.776 --> 19:12.670
Huh?

19:12.694 --> 19:14.756
You're asking me out.

19:14.780 --> 19:16.423
Oh, no, no, not exactly.

19:16.447 --> 19:18.051
Come here.

19:18.075 --> 19:19.927
I've been busting my brain
trying to think of a way

19:19.951 --> 19:22.262
to ask you out,
and here you are,

19:22.286 --> 19:27.291
looking all cute
and nervous about asking me.

19:35.383 --> 19:36.651
That should not have happened.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.029
It definitely should
have happened.

19:38.053 --> 19:39.446
No, no, no,
you don't understand.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.032
I am not asking you on a date.

19:41.056 --> 19:43.533
But I want to take
you out on a date.

19:43.557 --> 19:47.245
After this week's
sessions and the kiss and...

19:47.269 --> 19:48.622
Pig!

19:48.646 --> 19:50.374
You just hit on me and
I'm the pig?

19:50.398 --> 19:54.294
All right. I was wondering
if after one of our sessions,

19:54.318 --> 19:56.213
you would want to meet
my brother?

19:56.237 --> 19:57.238
Your brother?

19:59.407 --> 20:01.409
You have no interest
in going out with me?

20:03.202 --> 20:06.081
Well, I wouldn't say that.

20:14.965 --> 20:16.400
I will meet with you
and your brother

20:16.424 --> 20:18.069
tomorrow after our session.

20:18.093 --> 20:21.930
Then tomorrow evening,
I take you out on a real date.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.534
I can't.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.078
Why not?

20:27.102 --> 20:29.122
- Clients.
- Clients?

20:29.146 --> 20:31.022
I cut hair on the weekends.

20:39.114 --> 20:41.490
So when are you free?

20:43.451 --> 20:47.164
I'll have to check my schedule?

20:49.415 --> 20:50.666
Kiss me.

21:03.972 --> 21:06.599
You'll get back to me
on that date.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.316
♪♪

21:26.660 --> 21:29.681
I can hear you
thinking over there.

21:29.705 --> 21:33.643
What's got you so twisted up,
Vivy?

21:33.667 --> 21:38.965
I am so sorry for bothering you
in whatever it is...

21:39.966 --> 21:41.944
That you are doing.

21:41.968 --> 21:45.655
You're putting off
some tumultuous vibes.

21:45.679 --> 21:49.142
How do you expect
to teach a class like this? Sit.

21:54.064 --> 21:57.667
So why are you
sitting on a desk?

21:57.691 --> 21:59.212
Getting perspective.

21:59.236 --> 22:02.089
You know, accounting
is not my strong suit.

22:02.113 --> 22:05.200
And you have to sit on
a desk to get perspective?

22:07.409 --> 22:08.930
To fully understand the problem,

22:08.954 --> 22:12.016
it is best to give
all of yourself.

22:12.040 --> 22:14.143
So I inserted myself
into the chaos

22:14.167 --> 22:18.480
in the hopes that I find
a fix to my numbers issue.

22:18.504 --> 22:19.857
And did you get an answer?

22:19.881 --> 22:23.152
I did.
To ward off negativity.

22:23.176 --> 22:24.760
It's beautiful.

22:30.516 --> 22:33.561
What was the answer,
if you don't mind me asking?

22:34.645 --> 22:37.499
To hire an accountant.

22:37.523 --> 22:40.902
In the end, I realized I was
not needed in the equation.

22:41.987 --> 22:43.630
Is the center doing okay?

22:43.654 --> 22:45.549
Better than ever.

22:45.573 --> 22:46.926
Speaking of...

22:46.950 --> 22:49.535
I heard you had a
private lesson all week.

22:52.163 --> 22:54.808
Oh, whatever's going on
in that head of yours

22:54.832 --> 22:57.144
is torturous to watch.

22:57.168 --> 22:59.296
Please share with me.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.691
Your mama's not here.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.694
God bless her beautiful
young soul.

23:05.718 --> 23:07.345
You've got to work
with what you have.

23:09.888 --> 23:12.326
Okay.

23:12.350 --> 23:16.454
My private client is
professional baseball player

23:16.478 --> 23:18.540
Trent Fox.

23:18.564 --> 23:21.127
And yesterday
I kissed him right here.

23:21.151 --> 23:23.878
I mean, not right
here in Studio B,

23:23.902 --> 23:27.091
but now he wants to date me,

23:27.115 --> 23:30.743
and I'm going to
introduce him to Row, and...

23:31.869 --> 23:33.763
I shouldn't have kissed him.

23:33.787 --> 23:35.849
Why not?

23:35.873 --> 23:39.603
Because he's a player
and a client.

23:39.627 --> 23:42.522
We do not place
rules on sexual attraction.

23:42.546 --> 23:44.691
We have tantric workshops here.

23:44.715 --> 23:47.694
Still, it's not professional.

23:47.718 --> 23:50.780
Love, sex, and passion
usually aren't.

23:50.804 --> 23:54.952
But if this man gets your heart
and root chakra humming,

23:54.976 --> 23:56.769
why not enjoy yourself?

23:59.521 --> 24:01.316
And what if I fall
in love with him?

24:03.401 --> 24:05.611
Worse things have happened
to you, my dear.

24:07.946 --> 24:11.926
And what if he just wants sex
and not a relationship?

24:11.950 --> 24:13.161
Did he tell you that?

24:14.578 --> 24:15.621
Not exactly.

24:16.998 --> 24:19.643
He wants to take me on a date.

24:19.667 --> 24:22.063
And other things.

24:22.087 --> 24:25.215
And do you want
these other things to?

24:27.300 --> 24:28.343
Oh, yeah.

24:30.719 --> 24:32.781
Well, looks like
you have your answer.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.848
No, I don't.
I'm more confused than ever.

24:37.018 --> 24:42.457
If you want to spend time
with him, casual or otherwise,

24:42.481 --> 24:44.168
go ahead.

24:44.192 --> 24:46.461
You're a grown woman.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.798
Now, let's do a
quick chakra readjust.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.990
Can't have you spreading
this bad juju.

25:02.460 --> 25:04.688
I was trying meditation.

25:04.712 --> 25:08.109
Think I might take that hot
chick's class this weekend.

25:08.133 --> 25:10.152
Hot chick?

25:10.176 --> 25:12.779
Works in the bakery.

25:12.803 --> 25:13.929
Dara.

25:15.348 --> 25:16.391
Then, you know she's hot.

25:18.726 --> 25:21.579
We will begin today
with sun salutation.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.290
What did I do now?

25:23.314 --> 25:24.666
If you think
my friends are so hot,

25:24.690 --> 25:26.043
why don't you ask them out?

25:26.067 --> 25:27.068
You're jealous.

25:28.111 --> 25:30.505
You can date whoever you want.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.175
There are some lovely ladies
in and out of here.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.658
What am I going to do?

25:37.745 --> 25:40.182
Okay, boss, put me
through the paces.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.726
I got a hot date
that I don't want to miss.

Are you feeling okay?

25:56.473 --> 25:58.451
Totally fine.
Minimum day.

25:58.475 --> 25:59.993
Can I have a donut?

26:00.017 --> 26:01.786
Yeah, sure.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.581
Rowan, I'm sorry. I should
have checked the schedule.

26:04.605 --> 26:06.040
Don't worry about it.

26:06.064 --> 26:08.085
I don't mind taking home
little my sister.

Yeah, but still...

Rowan, this is my client.

- Client?

- Oh my God.

26:16.074 --> 26:17.761
Rowan Harper.

26:17.785 --> 26:20.097
You're, like, the best center
in baseball history.

26:20.121 --> 26:21.182
You play?

26:21.206 --> 26:22.599
Yeah, well, high school.

26:22.623 --> 26:24.559
Got the record for
most hits on my team.

26:24.583 --> 26:25.894
Any scouts at the games?

26:25.918 --> 26:27.896
Perhaps, but
I don't really care.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.482
According to his coach, he's got

26:29.506 --> 26:31.525
the best batting average
in the state of California.

26:31.549 --> 26:33.943
Really?
That's how I got my start.

26:33.967 --> 26:36.405
Well, I'm going
to Berkeley, so...

26:36.429 --> 26:37.822
That's not the plan, bro.

26:37.846 --> 26:39.241
You're going to take
the best package

26:39.265 --> 26:41.243
for your baseball career
and your education.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.620
Can we talk about this later?

26:43.644 --> 26:45.747
It's better financially
for us to stay local.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.082
Plus I already told coach
to talk to scouts.

26:48.106 --> 26:49.918
You mean scouts are
already asking about you?

26:49.942 --> 26:51.295
Yeah. All right.

26:51.319 --> 26:53.297
Can we get treats now?
Trent's waiting.

you some advice.

1:26:56.211 --> 1:26:57.188
But how about you?

1:26:57.212 --> 1:26:59.714
You know what I want to see.

1:27:01.299 --> 1:27:03.277
Do I have to?

1:27:03.301 --> 1:27:05.196
Come on.

1:27:05.220 --> 1:27:08.117
I mean, it's been a whole day.

1:27:08.141 --> 1:27:09.142
Fine.

1:27:13.562 --> 1:27:15.230
God. You are stunning, baby.

1:27:17.859 --> 1:27:19.878
You say that every day.

1:27:19.902 --> 1:27:22.131
How about this?

1:27:22.155 --> 1:27:23.841
Marry me.

1:27:23.865 --> 1:27:26.592
Same as yesterday.
Any time.

1:27:26.616 --> 1:27:28.428
Time for what?

1:27:28.452 --> 1:27:30.139
I just don't want it to be
about me being knocked up.

1:27:30.163 --> 1:27:31.722
Okay?

1:27:31.746 --> 1:27:37.603
Let's just talk about it
after he's born.

1:27:37.627 --> 1:27:40.023
Is it he?

1:27:40.047 --> 1:27:42.067
Oh, my God.
I am so sorry.

1:27:42.091 --> 1:27:45.904
I got the ultrasound yesterday
and I asked the technician

1:27:45.928 --> 1:27:48.406
what it was between his
legs, and she laughed.

1:27:48.430 --> 1:27:51.076
And I'm so sorry.

1:27:51.100 --> 1:27:53.494
I ruined the surprise.
Are you mad?

1:27:53.518 --> 1:27:56.747
Am I mad that I'm having a son?

1:27:56.771 --> 1:27:58.024
No, I'm fucking stoked.

1:28:00.943 --> 1:28:02.796
Are you still seeing that
root chakra red

1:28:02.820 --> 1:28:05.924
when you meditate
like I taught to you?

1:28:05.948 --> 1:28:07.324
Absolutely.

1:28:09.160 --> 1:28:11.054
Genevieve.

1:28:11.078 --> 1:28:12.806
From here on out.

1:28:12.830 --> 1:28:15.290
When I'm with you, I'm home.

1:28:22.297 --> 1:28:24.967
I am going to go.
Okay? Bye.

Bye.
