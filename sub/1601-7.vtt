00:00.146 --> 00:02.400
<i>Previously on Bates Motel... </i>

00:02.501 --> 00:04.069
I also think that they thought

00:04.170 --> 00:06.555
that Johnny was worth two of our guys,

00:06.617 --> 00:10.075
and two of our guys is worth
ten of their guys or maybe 12,

00:10.176 --> 00:13.445
or however many I can get
in one place at one time.

00:13.546 --> 00:15.447
He's blacked out twice in front of me.

00:15.548 --> 00:17.249
And he told me it's happened before.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.084
He, like, leaves his mind.

00:19.185 --> 00:21.353
He can physically move,
and he can talk a little,

00:21.454 --> 00:22.684
but he's not in there.

00:22.746 --> 00:25.357
It's me, Cody. Can you hear me?

00:25.458 --> 00:27.525
I didn't tell your mom. I told Emma.

00:27.627 --> 00:29.327
That's as good as telling my mom.

00:29.428 --> 00:31.596
I got to go to work.
What's this guy doing here?

00:31.697 --> 00:33.665
I came here to talk to your daughter.

00:33.766 --> 00:36.034
- What?
- Just go back to bed, dad.

00:36.135 --> 00:38.703
[Both yelling]

00:38.804 --> 00:41.139
Dad!

00:47.112 --> 00:49.013
Norman, where are you?

00:49.114 --> 00:51.683
This is not cool, okay?

00:51.784 --> 00:53.217
Honey, I know you're mad,

00:53.318 --> 00:57.522
but you can't just walk down
a road and disappear on me.

00:57.623 --> 01:00.925
I'm at city hall right now
picking up a parking pass

01:01.026 --> 01:02.760
or something they called me about,

01:02.861 --> 01:05.930
but I'm gonna be home soon,
and we need to talk, okay?

01:06.031 --> 01:07.532
[Sighs]

01:07.633 --> 01:11.235
I'm worried about you, so please call me.

[Indistinct chatter, telephones ringing]

01:34.827 --> 01:38.162
[Sighs]

01:38.263 --> 01:41.799
- Norma Bates?
- Hi.

01:41.900 --> 01:43.768
I'm Anne Dietrich. We spoke on the phone.

01:43.869 --> 01:46.437
Oh, yes, of course. Nice to meet you.

01:46.538 --> 01:48.606
Glad you could get here before
we close for the evening.

01:48.707 --> 01:50.208
I have everything together for you...

01:50.309 --> 01:52.877
parking pass, I.D. card, keys.

01:52.978 --> 01:55.580
I wanted you to have it as
much in advance as possible.

01:55.681 --> 01:56.948
Well, I appreciate that.

01:57.049 --> 01:58.983
I know I'm gonna be playing catch-up.

01:59.084 --> 02:01.986
Well, I'm sure you can handle it.

02:02.087 --> 02:03.788
Would you like to see your office?

02:03.889 --> 02:06.591
- I have an office?
- Right this way.

02:06.692 --> 02:08.158
I didn't know this came with an office.

02:08.259 --> 02:10.995
I mean... I mean, it's nice.

02:11.096 --> 02:13.998
I mean, it's good to have an office.

02:14.099 --> 02:16.567
Yeah.

02:23.575 --> 02:25.910
Mrs. Bates.

02:26.011 --> 02:28.513
Max Borowitz... Councilman, District 4.

02:28.614 --> 02:30.815
Oh, nice to meet you.

02:30.916 --> 02:33.151
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

02:33.252 --> 02:35.153
Can you come to my office for a minute?

02:35.254 --> 02:37.622
I'd like to run something by you.

02:37.723 --> 02:40.258
- Absolutely.
- Great.

02:41.660 --> 02:43.695
I'm really sorry I missed that last meeting

02:43.796 --> 02:46.531
when you called Lee Berman a dick.

02:46.632 --> 02:49.000
Yeah, well, uh, I'm a little embarrassed

02:49.101 --> 02:50.568
about all that now.

02:50.669 --> 02:53.805
Don't be. He was, God rest his soul.

02:53.906 --> 02:55.873
What's weird is the way you ended up

02:55.975 --> 02:58.543
taking his place on the council.

02:58.644 --> 03:00.712
Life is funny, huh?

03:00.813 --> 03:03.615
Yeah, I guess it is. [Sighs]

03:03.716 --> 03:06.484
Yeah, i-it makes me feel a little bad.

03:06.585 --> 03:09.420
Seat opened up, and you got it.

03:09.521 --> 03:11.689
- How did you get it?
- How did I get it?

03:11.790 --> 03:14.659
- Uh-huh.
- I just met with the Mayor.

03:14.760 --> 03:17.195
[Scoffs] You're funny.

03:17.296 --> 03:19.364
Let's cut right through the crap.

03:19.465 --> 03:21.399
I know you don't want the bypass.

03:21.500 --> 03:25.870
- That's your issue, and...
- Max, I need to talk to Norma.

03:25.971 --> 03:29.273
Oh, okay.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.877
Excuse us. [Chuckles]

03:32.978 --> 03:34.612
That was really embarrassing, Alex.

03:34.713 --> 03:36.514
Why'd you pull me out of there like that?

03:36.615 --> 03:39.317
Because something happened.
I need you to come with me.

03:39.418 --> 03:41.953
What? Is it Norman or Dylan?

03:42.054 --> 03:43.655
- What? What happened?
- They're okay.

03:43.756 --> 03:46.457
Just come with me.

03:46.558 --> 03:48.459
What the hell is going
on? Tell me right now.

03:48.560 --> 03:49.961
Stop, okay?

03:50.062 --> 03:52.263
Something happened, all
right? Norman's fine.

03:52.364 --> 03:53.598
You said that already, but what?

03:53.699 --> 03:55.400
He was with Cody Brennen at her place,

03:55.501 --> 03:57.535
and there was some kind
of fight, apparently.

04:00.673 --> 04:03.908
Her father's dead.

04:04.009 --> 04:05.910
How did he die?

04:06.011 --> 04:08.446
Norman's saying it was self-defense.

04:08.547 --> 04:09.647
There was a fight.

04:09.748 --> 04:12.350
Her dad got pushed down the stairs.

04:17.822 --> 04:21.625
[Crackling electricity]

04:29.601 --> 04:32.603
[Truck door opens]

04:35.874 --> 04:38.309
[Sighs] Okay, look, here's
what's gonna happen...

04:38.410 --> 04:40.211
I want to see Norman.

04:40.312 --> 04:42.714
I know you do, but there's a
process we need to go through

04:42.815 --> 04:44.582
- for something like this.
- Something like what?

04:44.683 --> 04:47.452
When somebody dies and the
circumstances aren't clear.

04:47.553 --> 04:50.488
- You said it was self-defense.
- I said Norman said that.

04:50.589 --> 04:52.824
- Now we're looking into it.
- You don't believe him?

04:52.925 --> 04:55.960
Norma, what I'm doing is
I'm following procedure

04:56.061 --> 04:57.695
and covering all the bases.

04:57.796 --> 04:59.864
This is normal, okay? You want something?

04:59.965 --> 05:02.300
You want water, cup of coffee?

05:02.401 --> 05:04.168
- I just want to see Norman.
- Okay.

05:04.269 --> 05:08.473
Just sit tight, be patient, and you will.

05:15.714 --> 05:18.916
[Door buzzes]

05:23.822 --> 05:28.059
Turn your head to the left
and lift your chin, please.

05:29.862 --> 05:33.765
Thank you. And now the same to the right.

05:35.434 --> 05:37.435
Okay.

05:42.541 --> 05:44.542
Open.

05:48.347 --> 05:51.382
Okay, you can relax.

05:52.551 --> 05:54.786
Can I, uh... Can I just ask?

05:54.887 --> 05:56.788
W-what are you gonna do
with all that stuff...

05:56.889 --> 05:59.457
you know, the... the
nails and the finger clips?

05:59.558 --> 06:00.892
You know, what are... what
are you gonna do with...

06:00.993 --> 06:03.594
It's evidence for the investigation.

06:03.695 --> 06:06.230
But it was an accident. There
was an accident. Why do...

06:06.331 --> 06:09.333
Take your shirt off.
Put this one on, please.

06:09.334 --> 06:12.470
Why?

06:14.339 --> 06:16.908
Oh, no, I-I told Sheriff Romero.

06:17.009 --> 06:21.712
It's... it's my blood, not mister...

06:21.814 --> 06:24.182
I-I got hit, you know, in... in the face.

06:24.283 --> 06:27.285
I was bleeding. It's mine.

06:31.023 --> 06:34.425
Well, then I am sure that's
what the lab will say.

06:34.526 --> 06:36.694
He just fell back down the stairwell.

06:36.795 --> 06:38.663
It... it was an accident.

06:38.764 --> 06:40.731
Accidents need to be investigated, too,

06:40.833 --> 06:45.536
to make sure they were actually accidents.

06:45.637 --> 06:47.338
Okay, that's it.

06:47.439 --> 06:49.841
We're done in here for now.

06:49.942 --> 06:52.310
Is Cody all right? Can I talk to her?

06:52.411 --> 06:54.812
Later maybe, not right now.

06:54.913 --> 06:56.380
Can I go?

06:56.481 --> 06:58.716
Not right now.

07:02.221 --> 07:03.821
So what's going on with you, man?

07:04.022 --> 07:05.456
Tell me what's happening.

07:05.557 --> 07:07.425
I thought we were friends.

07:07.526 --> 07:10.628
- It's just some personal sh...
- With my mother.

07:10.729 --> 07:13.264
I'll deal with it.

07:13.365 --> 07:15.900
Well, you get tired of sleeping down here

07:16.001 --> 07:17.568
or with the boss,

07:17.669 --> 07:21.572
you're welcome to come
and crash at my place.

07:21.673 --> 07:23.875
- Sleeping with the boss?
- [Chuckles]

07:23.976 --> 07:25.643
Yeah, she called me up,

07:25.744 --> 07:28.246
told me she was picking you
up at the hospital, not me.

07:28.347 --> 07:30.882
Then I don't see you for
about a day and a half.

07:30.983 --> 07:32.416
You know, based on the 23 years

07:32.517 --> 07:33.885
I've been working for this family

07:33.986 --> 07:35.786
and knowing a little bit about Jodi Morgan,

07:35.888 --> 07:38.522
I'm kind of kojaking
that that's what happened.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.958
[Chuckles]

07:41.059 --> 07:43.761
So how was it?

07:43.862 --> 07:47.198
- How was what?
- Come on...

07:47.299 --> 07:50.835
- Details.
- [Scoffs] Not a chance.

07:50.936 --> 07:52.870
This place used to be a cannery.

07:52.971 --> 07:56.507
The family took it over about 20 years ago.

07:56.608 --> 07:58.943
And this is Dylan and Remo...

07:59.044 --> 08:00.811
Hard at work, it seems.

08:00.913 --> 08:03.147
Oh, hey, Teddy came and picked up

08:03.248 --> 08:05.883
that order for Orange County, boss.

08:05.984 --> 08:07.919
We're... we're done for the day, really.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.787
Well, unless you need us to do something.

08:09.888 --> 08:13.557
Nope. Thanks, but I'm good.

08:13.659 --> 08:16.427
- Who's your friends?
- Just some buddies.

08:16.528 --> 08:18.562
They're gonna do a job for us.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.198
- Doing what?
- Not your concern right now.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.701
Come on.

08:31.343 --> 08:34.278
- He's going rogue on us...
- Wonderful.

08:34.379 --> 08:36.313
What do you think he's got planned?

08:36.414 --> 08:38.849
Nothing good, that's for sure.

08:41.886 --> 08:44.155
- Norma?
- Emma, what are you doing here?

08:44.256 --> 08:46.123
I heard about what
happened. Is Norman okay?

08:46.224 --> 08:48.492
He's in there talking to Sheriff Romero.

08:48.593 --> 08:51.662
- How did you find out?
- My dad heard about it in town.

08:51.763 --> 08:53.464
From what I heard, it was self-defense.

08:53.565 --> 08:54.765
They can't be blaming Norman.

08:54.866 --> 08:57.234
He would never do anything like this.

08:59.905 --> 09:01.572
Oh, this is crazy. I'm sorry.

09:01.673 --> 09:03.407
But they can't just not tell you anything

09:03.508 --> 09:04.909
and leave you hanging like this.

09:05.010 --> 09:06.977
I want to know what's going on in there.

09:07.078 --> 09:09.580
Well, let's find out.

09:09.681 --> 09:11.682
You shouldn't be alone.
I'm gonna stay with you...

09:11.783 --> 09:13.484
all night if that's what it takes.

09:13.585 --> 09:16.887
Honey, you are so sweet.
I-I can't let you do that.

09:16.988 --> 09:18.656
Go back home. Take care of the motel.

09:18.757 --> 09:20.024
That's how you can help.

09:20.125 --> 09:22.927
Okay, thank you so much
for checking in on us.

09:23.028 --> 09:25.529
That... that just means the world.

09:25.630 --> 09:28.365
You're such a good girl.

09:28.466 --> 09:30.834
Thank you.

09:36.708 --> 09:38.108
[Knock at door]

09:38.210 --> 09:40.578
Got everything we need from Norman Bates...

09:40.679 --> 09:42.446
blood, hair, prints, you name it.

09:42.547 --> 09:43.981
I woke up my buddy at the state lab

09:44.082 --> 09:45.649
so we can get the stuff processed.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.952
You woke him up? Did I
even ask you to do this?

09:48.053 --> 09:50.621
Well, no, but he doesn't mind.

09:50.722 --> 09:52.489
He was my assistant
back when I ran the lab.

09:52.591 --> 09:54.625
This is one of those "it's good
to know someone" situations.

09:54.726 --> 09:56.060
We'll get the results back fast.

09:56.161 --> 09:57.461
I'm just not sure how much

09:57.562 --> 09:58.963
nail clippings are gonna tell us.

09:59.064 --> 10:00.798
You never know.

10:00.899 --> 10:02.633
You can't discount anything
when you got a dead body.

10:02.734 --> 10:04.001
And if you want to know my opinion...

10:04.102 --> 10:05.636
Uh, no, I don't actually think I do.

10:05.737 --> 10:07.438
- Just go.
- Okay.

10:07.539 --> 10:09.039
In fact, if you want to
drive those evidence samples

10:09.140 --> 10:10.808
to Portland to your lab-tech friend,

10:10.909 --> 10:12.876
go right ahead and do that.

10:12.978 --> 10:14.845
- He's coming to pick 'em up.
- Great.

10:14.946 --> 10:18.682
- I told him I can't leave here.
- Then go wait for him.

10:18.783 --> 10:21.252
Okay.

10:24.555 --> 10:27.557
[Laughs]

10:31.729 --> 10:35.031
[Sighs]

10:35.133 --> 10:37.701
[Laughs]

10:37.802 --> 10:39.503
Excuse me? I need to
talk to Sheriff Romero.

10:39.604 --> 10:41.138
I've been waiting to see my son.

10:41.239 --> 10:42.506
I need to know when that's going to happen.

10:42.607 --> 10:44.174
I don't know, Mrs. Bates,

10:44.275 --> 10:45.942
but I'll pass the
message on to the Sheriff.

10:46.043 --> 10:47.511
No, that's not good enough.

10:47.612 --> 10:49.946
I either want to see my son right now,

10:50.047 --> 10:51.681
or I want Sheriff Romero
to tell me personally

10:51.783 --> 10:53.984
why I can't see him so
I can tell my lawyer.

10:54.085 --> 10:56.419
Mrs. Bates, you can come back now.

10:56.521 --> 10:59.523
[Sighs]

11:02.493 --> 11:04.661
Regina?

11:04.762 --> 11:07.230
[Door buzzes]

11:11.035 --> 11:13.103
Oh, honey.

11:13.204 --> 11:14.671
Look at you.

11:14.772 --> 11:17.340
You must have been so scared.

11:17.441 --> 11:20.177
Why did you go to that girl's house?

11:20.278 --> 11:22.045
- Your face.
- Oh.

11:22.146 --> 11:24.314
- Are you hurt?
- It's not that bad.

11:24.415 --> 11:26.416
What happened? Tell me everything.

11:26.517 --> 11:28.318
I went over to see Cody

11:28.419 --> 11:30.921
'cause I was mad at her for
telling Emma about my blackout

11:31.022 --> 11:32.389
and Emma telling you.

11:32.490 --> 11:34.958
We were arguing, and...
and then her dad came out

11:35.059 --> 11:36.626
and was really angry
and started hurting Cody.

11:36.727 --> 11:38.995
So I tried to help her, and he hit me.

11:39.096 --> 11:40.497
Then I just tried to push him away,

11:40.598 --> 11:42.499
and he fell down these
really steep stairs, and...

11:42.600 --> 11:45.035
You can't tell them that you
were arguing with Cody, honey.

11:45.136 --> 11:46.703
Why... why wouldn't I tell them that?

11:46.804 --> 11:48.638
Because you... you... You can't tell them

11:48.739 --> 11:51.007
that you black out, Norman.

11:51.108 --> 11:53.376
T-they're not gonna understand that.

11:53.477 --> 11:54.544
What do you mean?

11:54.645 --> 11:56.012
Just tell them that you went over

11:56.113 --> 11:57.480
to hang out or watch TV or something.

11:57.582 --> 11:59.416
No, no. He was only mad 'cause I was mad.

11:59.517 --> 12:01.084
He yelled 'cause I was yelling,

12:01.185 --> 12:02.652
and Cody came between us, and he hit her.

12:02.753 --> 12:04.454
Well, make sure you tell them that.

12:04.555 --> 12:06.289
I did.

12:08.125 --> 12:10.126
Why are you so worried? It was an accident.

12:10.228 --> 12:12.295
I know. I know it was.

12:12.396 --> 12:14.998
I'm sure you were very frightened

12:15.099 --> 12:18.568
and things just were happening so fast.

12:20.471 --> 12:24.274
Why don't you believe me?

12:24.375 --> 12:27.143
Norman, I'm just trying to make you see

12:27.245 --> 12:28.979
how them knowing certain things

12:29.080 --> 12:31.314
will make it impossible for
them to believe you like I do.

12:31.415 --> 12:33.650
It was an accident.

12:33.751 --> 12:36.953
Hey. Sorry about the delay.

12:37.054 --> 12:38.955
You want to come back with me, Norman?

12:39.056 --> 12:40.523
So what's happening now?

12:40.625 --> 12:43.159
We just... we need to go
through everything one more time.

12:43.261 --> 12:45.629
But he has to have me
in there too, doesn't he?

12:45.730 --> 12:47.497
He's still a minor. Isn't that the law?

12:47.598 --> 12:50.100
No, he's not under arrest.
He's just talking to me.

12:50.201 --> 12:52.936
You don't legally have to be in there.

12:53.037 --> 12:55.238
But if Norman wants you in there anyway,

12:55.339 --> 12:57.173
- that's fine with me.
- No, I-I don't.

12:57.275 --> 12:59.542
- She can stay out here.
- Okay. All right.

12:59.644 --> 13:01.177
We'll be back soon.

13:01.279 --> 13:03.280
- Alex?
- It's a couple questions...

13:03.381 --> 13:05.315
just some things I didn't have time for.

13:05.416 --> 13:07.250
Questions about what?

13:07.351 --> 13:09.619
Norma, you have to try and
disengage a little, all right?

13:09.720 --> 13:11.254
You're gonna make yourself crazy.

13:11.355 --> 13:13.156
Disengage? I'm his mother. Are you kidding?

13:13.257 --> 13:14.658
You're gonna patronize me over this?

13:14.759 --> 13:16.293
- I've done your laundry.
- We're just gonna talk

13:16.394 --> 13:18.128
and make sure we're not missing anything,

13:18.229 --> 13:19.596
and then we'll be done.

13:53.573 --> 13:56.408
I was just trying to protect her.

13:58.578 --> 14:01.647
You know, we were all
pulling on each other, and...

14:01.748 --> 14:05.317
Then he turned on me
and... and lunged at me,

14:05.418 --> 14:07.386
and I...

14:07.487 --> 14:10.990
I-I pushed back at him, and
he just... just stumbled back

14:11.057 --> 14:14.360
and went all the way down the stairwell.

14:14.427 --> 14:16.762
I just didn't move.

14:20.267 --> 14:23.802
I keep seeing his face when he was falling.

14:26.806 --> 14:29.408
Yeah, it's a hard thing to see.

14:38.525 --> 14:40.386
So, um...

14:40.453 --> 14:44.089
What's... what's gonna happen to Cody?

14:47.360 --> 14:49.361
[Sighs] Well, you know, she's 17,

14:49.462 --> 14:52.364
so she still needs a guardian.

14:52.465 --> 14:56.001
Her aunt, her mother's sister...
she lives near Fort Wayne.

14:56.102 --> 14:59.371
We got in touch with her,
and she's gonna go there.

14:59.472 --> 15:01.607
- Well, is she nice?
- Yeah.

15:01.708 --> 15:03.676
As much as you can tell on the phone, yeah.

15:03.743 --> 15:06.612
Well, that's good.

15:06.713 --> 15:09.548
[Sighs]

15:15.455 --> 15:17.690
You know, Norman...

15:17.791 --> 15:18.957
[Sighs]

15:19.025 --> 15:21.226
Jimmy Brennen... he grew up here,

15:21.294 --> 15:24.196
so I knew him for a long, long time,

15:24.297 --> 15:28.334
and he was angry for pretty much all of it.

15:28.435 --> 15:31.270
But if I hadn't of been
there when he woke up,

15:31.371 --> 15:34.206
then he'd still be alive right now.

15:34.307 --> 15:36.742
Nothing can change that.

15:39.326 --> 15:41.122
You're right. You're right.

15:45.719 --> 15:48.721
Have some cocoa while it's hot, huh?

16:11.378 --> 16:13.112
Hey. You all right?

16:13.413 --> 16:15.147
How did you know I was here?

16:15.215 --> 16:16.849
I got a phone call from a friend...

16:16.950 --> 16:18.717
well, actually, two friends.

16:18.818 --> 16:21.020
It's a small town. Gossip
travels at the speed of light.

16:21.121 --> 16:22.788
- Gossip?
- Don't worry about that.

16:22.856 --> 16:26.725
It doesn't matter. Is Norman all right?

16:26.826 --> 16:28.494
Norman isn't even near all right.

16:28.595 --> 16:30.162
He's very upset. He's worried.

16:30.230 --> 16:31.830
He doesn't know what's going on.

16:31.932 --> 16:33.499
What they're doing here, Norma...

16:33.600 --> 16:34.934
it's just standard procedure.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.502
Okay, well, when can we go home?

16:36.603 --> 16:39.171
When they've got all the facts down.

16:39.239 --> 16:41.340
You're a lawyer. Do you
know how all this works?

16:41.408 --> 16:42.841
I do.

16:47.147 --> 16:50.716
Norman, um...

16:50.784 --> 16:53.752
He just wanted to talk to Cody.

16:53.853 --> 16:57.456
And then he comes barging in.

16:57.524 --> 16:59.258
He's drunk. He won't listen.

16:59.326 --> 17:01.293
He's making accusations.

17:01.394 --> 17:03.796
And then he attacks Norman
and then his own daughter,

17:03.897 --> 17:05.431
and she is so small.

17:05.531 --> 17:07.098
She's like a little bird.

17:07.166 --> 17:10.703
How is she gonna stand a
chance against a man like that?

17:10.804 --> 17:13.137
She needed help. Norman
only ever wants to help.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.007
Norma, I don't do criminal law,

17:15.075 --> 17:18.143
but I know enough that
if that's what happened,

17:18.244 --> 17:22.714
Norman has absolutely
nothing to worry about.

17:22.816 --> 17:26.018
Okay. [Sniffles]

17:26.086 --> 17:29.021
So we go in the front gate,
hit 'em front on, right?

17:29.089 --> 17:30.356
No one will know what's happening.

17:30.457 --> 17:32.591
- Yeah?
- All right.

17:48.975 --> 17:51.810
So what are those guys here for?

17:51.911 --> 17:53.779
- Why?
- No, I just thought

17:53.880 --> 17:55.447
that if you were... if you
were planning something,

17:55.548 --> 17:59.285
maybe I could help out.

17:59.386 --> 18:04.156
Oh, hey, speaking of plans...

18:04.257 --> 18:06.859
I know about yours.

18:06.926 --> 18:10.796
Well, I guess it's more my sister's plan...

18:10.897 --> 18:13.098
You know, for you to watch my back.

18:13.199 --> 18:17.303
And, no, Jodi didn't tell me,
if that's what you're wondering,

18:17.404 --> 18:20.172
although I do get why
she wants you to do it.

18:20.273 --> 18:23.175
- It's not like that.
- Dude, it's fine.

18:23.276 --> 18:25.144
I get it.

18:25.211 --> 18:29.782
I got out of jail, and she
just handed me this job.

18:29.849 --> 18:31.417
She didn't even hesitate.

18:31.484 --> 18:34.486
So, if that's what she wants to do, then...

18:34.587 --> 18:36.822
I'm good.

18:36.923 --> 18:40.159
I just wanted you to know that, uh...

18:40.226 --> 18:42.027
I knew.

18:53.039 --> 18:55.441
I probably don't need to tell you.

18:55.508 --> 18:57.309
You look like you know
your way around women,

18:57.410 --> 19:00.446
but, uh, if you're gonna
sleep with my sister,

19:00.513 --> 19:02.348
manage your expectations.

19:02.415 --> 19:04.717
- I don't...
- Yeah, sure, I know.

19:04.784 --> 19:06.285
It's just, uh...

19:06.386 --> 19:09.288
It's not her first time
below her pay grade.

19:09.389 --> 19:12.291
You're keeping me from getting hurt, right?

19:12.392 --> 19:15.227
I don't want you to get hurt either.

19:47.994 --> 19:50.996
[Toilet flushes]

19:52.599 --> 19:55.334
How are you, Cody?

19:55.435 --> 19:57.436
Bad.

19:59.172 --> 20:02.941
Um, I know you don't like me.

20:03.009 --> 20:06.779
I can understand that. It's
probably my fault anyway.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.747
But, please...

20:08.815 --> 20:13.419
You can't tell them
about Norman's blackouts.

20:13.520 --> 20:17.189
- Why would that even come up?
- Well, I don't know.

20:17.290 --> 20:19.358
I don't know what they're going to ask you.

20:19.459 --> 20:21.226
They're gonna ask me what
happened when my dad died.

20:21.294 --> 20:23.462
Of course. I know.

20:23.563 --> 20:26.198
I am sorry.

20:26.299 --> 20:29.368
But they might just ask
about Norman, in general.

20:29.469 --> 20:31.203
And if they do,

20:31.304 --> 20:33.539
the fact that he's
blacked out on occasion...

20:33.640 --> 20:35.307
they might make that something it's not.

20:35.408 --> 20:37.142
- Why?
- I don't know.

20:37.210 --> 20:39.077
They might think there's
something wrong with him.

20:39.179 --> 20:41.213
- Is there?
- It's not relevant to this.

20:41.314 --> 20:43.382
You think it is.

20:43.483 --> 20:45.551
Even though Norman
didn't black out tonight,

20:45.652 --> 20:48.387
to you, it's connected.

20:48.488 --> 20:51.223
Tell me why you don't want me
to say anything, and I won't.

20:51.324 --> 20:54.326
You saw him firsthand
when he was like that.

20:54.394 --> 20:56.829
Did he hurt you?

20:56.930 --> 20:59.031
Did he hurt anyone? Was
he angry or uncontrollable?

20:59.132 --> 21:00.999
No, right?

21:01.100 --> 21:03.335
He just wasn't himself,
and there's no good reason

21:03.403 --> 21:06.104
that anyone should know that.

21:06.206 --> 21:08.407
But...

21:14.247 --> 21:15.848
You done in here, hon?

21:15.949 --> 21:18.417
Your aunt's on the phone for you.

21:42.058 --> 21:45.060
[Rattling]

21:48.931 --> 21:51.133
Um, thanks for letting me come meet you.

21:51.234 --> 21:52.968
What do you want, Emma?

21:53.069 --> 21:54.503
If Norma put you up to this,
you might as well tell me now

21:54.604 --> 21:56.238
so we don't waste each other's time.

21:56.339 --> 21:58.507
She didn't. She has no idea I'm even here.

22:00.943 --> 22:04.012
- You want anything?
- No, no, I'm good.

22:04.080 --> 22:07.983
But the reason I'm here
is about her and Norman.

22:08.084 --> 22:10.852
He's down at the police station.
Cody Brennen's father died.

22:10.953 --> 22:12.187
Yeah, I know.

22:12.255 --> 22:15.857
Norma left me a voice mail.

22:15.958 --> 22:18.960
- Have they arrested him yet?
- I don't know all the details,

22:19.061 --> 22:21.062
but from everything I've
heard, it was an accident.

22:21.164 --> 22:24.232
Yeah, well, if it was an
accident, then it's no big deal.

22:24.333 --> 22:28.370
What am I supposed to do about it, anyways?

22:28.437 --> 22:31.039
You could be there for them, for Norman.

22:31.140 --> 22:32.541
That's what you could do.

22:32.642 --> 22:34.376
Norman doesn't connect
with a lot of people.

22:34.443 --> 22:37.045
- You matter to him.
- I can't help him, okay?

22:37.146 --> 22:39.447
He's just gonna have to figure
some things out for himself,

22:39.549 --> 22:41.349
especially between him and Norma.

22:41.450 --> 22:42.984
They only care about each other.

22:43.085 --> 22:44.719
Whatever you guys fought about,

22:44.821 --> 22:46.421
can't you just take a
break, just for right now?

22:46.522 --> 22:48.824
So, basically, it doesn't
matter how people treat you?

22:49.125 --> 22:51.026
When they need something,
you just go running back.

22:51.127 --> 22:52.627
- Is that how it is?
- Is that what happened?

22:52.728 --> 22:55.030
- It doesn't matter.
- I'm not going.

22:55.131 --> 22:56.531
Somebody died. Are you just
gonna let him figure that out

22:56.632 --> 22:58.366
for himself, let him
deal with it on his own?

22:58.467 --> 23:00.101
- I can't fix this.
- Of course you can't.

23:00.202 --> 23:01.703
So don't go. Don't help. Don't do anything.

23:01.771 --> 23:03.538
You know, I wish I had
a mother and a brother

23:03.639 --> 23:05.206
I could treat like sh...

23:05.307 --> 23:08.309
[Oxygen tank rattling]

23:19.789 --> 23:21.790
[Door closes]

23:25.061 --> 23:28.129
Norma, know that I'm here for you...

23:28.230 --> 23:30.465
anything you need.

23:30.566 --> 23:33.068
I promise I'll help you.

23:33.135 --> 23:35.236
This is all gonna be fine.

23:41.110 --> 23:43.244
Why are you so nice?

23:47.583 --> 23:50.351
Mother?

23:50.419 --> 23:54.923
Sheriff. Phone for you.

23:54.990 --> 23:58.259
Uh, you guys can have a few minutes.

24:00.262 --> 24:02.030
Why is he here?

24:02.131 --> 24:05.533
George came to see if we
are all right, to help us.

24:05.634 --> 24:07.068
Hey, Norman.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.575
Uh, you know what? You
guys have had a long night.

24:13.676 --> 24:16.544
I'll give you some privacy.

24:16.645 --> 24:19.013
George?

24:19.115 --> 24:20.982
Thank you so much.

24:21.050 --> 24:23.284
It's gonna be okay.

24:27.423 --> 24:28.923
He's an attorney. He can help us.

24:29.024 --> 24:30.492
- With what?
- [Door opens]

24:32.294 --> 24:35.697
Cody.

24:35.798 --> 24:39.567
Are you okay?

24:46.442 --> 24:48.576
I need some fresh air.

24:50.613 --> 24:52.247
Norman.

25:13.435 --> 25:16.905
[Sighs] You guys must be exhausted.

25:17.006 --> 25:19.040
I'm gonna have a deputy take you home.

25:19.141 --> 25:20.608
Really?

25:20.709 --> 25:22.177
Yeah, you can go.

25:22.278 --> 25:25.280
We're done with Norman for now.

25:28.350 --> 25:31.352
[Sniffles]

25:41.430 --> 25:43.398
Why didn't you let me
do that for you, Norman?

25:43.465 --> 25:45.633
Oh, it's fine, mom. I got it myself.

25:45.734 --> 25:48.203
Okay.

25:50.372 --> 25:54.008
Oh, no, does he think I'm a murderer?

25:54.109 --> 25:58.313
- Sheriff Romero?
- No, your, uh, friend...

25:58.380 --> 26:00.148
- George.
- Oh.

26:00.216 --> 26:02.317
[Scoffs] No, honey, no.

26:02.384 --> 26:04.886
He knows you could never
do something like that.

26:04.987 --> 26:07.155
- How?
- Because I told him.

26:07.223 --> 26:08.923
But he doesn't even know me.

26:09.024 --> 26:11.092
I told him about you.

26:11.193 --> 26:14.195
So you just told him,
and... and he believed it,

26:14.296 --> 26:15.396
even though he doesn't know me?

26:15.497 --> 26:16.998
And I told you, and...

26:17.099 --> 26:18.666
and you know me better than anyone.

26:18.767 --> 26:20.335
And you didn't?

26:20.402 --> 26:22.470
- And you still don't?
- That's not true.

26:22.571 --> 26:25.173
Whether or not you like Cody
or if I should have been there,

26:25.274 --> 26:28.610
I was there, and I
couldn't let him hurt her.

26:28.677 --> 26:30.478
I had to try to help her.

26:30.579 --> 26:33.381
Are... are you mad at me?
Did... did I do something wrong?

26:33.482 --> 26:37.285
- It's not that.
- Well, then what is it?

26:37.386 --> 26:39.220
- Why don't you believe me?
- I do.

26:39.321 --> 26:41.256
But... What?

26:41.323 --> 26:43.358
Sweetheart, it's... it's just...

26:43.425 --> 26:45.460
[Sighs]

26:45.561 --> 26:47.695
I don't know what you want me to say.

26:56.405 --> 26:59.407
I'm not hungry anymore.

27:10.252 --> 27:12.920
Hi.

27:12.988 --> 27:14.422
I didn't want to text or call or bug you,

27:14.523 --> 27:15.657
but what's going on?

27:15.724 --> 27:17.425
Is everything settled? Is it over?

27:17.526 --> 27:19.661
I-I don't know.

27:19.728 --> 27:22.297
They let me go home last night, so...

27:22.364 --> 27:23.998
If they were gonna
arrest you for something,

27:24.099 --> 27:25.166
they would have by now, right?

27:25.267 --> 27:27.001
Or they're not going to anyway

27:27.102 --> 27:29.103
because obviously it was an accident.

27:29.171 --> 27:30.905
Are you okay?

27:31.006 --> 27:33.308
I guess, yeah.

27:33.375 --> 27:35.510
You know, I mean, it's...
it's way worse for Cody

27:35.611 --> 27:37.211
and for her dad.

27:37.279 --> 27:39.013
Yeah. No, I know.

27:39.081 --> 27:40.481
But still, it must have been so awful.

27:40.549 --> 27:42.617
I was mad at her... Cody...

27:42.718 --> 27:45.386
you know, for telling you
about what happened to me.

27:45.454 --> 27:46.921
That's why I went over there,

27:47.022 --> 27:48.856
because if she hadn't have told you,

27:48.924 --> 27:51.359
then you couldn't have told my mom.

27:53.529 --> 27:55.129
I'm sorry, Norman.

27:55.197 --> 27:57.165
I was just worried about
you, scared for you.

27:57.266 --> 27:58.966
If anything had happened to you

27:59.068 --> 28:00.968
and I hadn't said something
that could've helped...

28:01.070 --> 28:03.971
I know. I-I'm sorry.

28:04.073 --> 28:05.907
I just...

28:06.008 --> 28:07.608
I know you did the right
thing, and I'm not mad anymore,

28:07.710 --> 28:09.444
not at you.

28:09.545 --> 28:11.312
I was just telling you
the reason I was at Cody's

28:11.380 --> 28:13.481
in the first place.

28:13.582 --> 28:15.283
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

28:15.351 --> 28:17.251
I mean, I can't ever trust you again,

28:17.353 --> 28:18.753
but I'm not mad.

28:22.191 --> 28:23.458
Shut up.

28:23.559 --> 28:26.227
Emma...

28:26.295 --> 28:28.129
Thank you.

28:28.230 --> 28:29.497
I mean it.

28:29.598 --> 28:33.267
- For what?
- For believing in me.

28:35.404 --> 28:38.272
Whatever. You're welcome.

28:50.939 --> 28:53.841
[Cell phone chimes]

28:56.260 --> 28:58.093
_

28:58.147 --> 29:01.015
[Breathing heavily]

29:01.116 --> 29:03.851
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:03.952 --> 29:05.687
God, I was so worried about you.

29:05.788 --> 29:07.855
They wouldn't let me talk to you.

29:07.956 --> 29:09.157
They wanted to make sure

29:09.258 --> 29:10.692
we couldn't get our stories straight.

29:10.793 --> 29:14.696
I mean, look at us...
total Bonnie and Clyde.

29:14.797 --> 29:16.064
I'm so sorry.

29:19.968 --> 29:21.869
Now he's always gonna be pissed off

29:21.970 --> 29:25.540
and bitter and drunk...

29:25.641 --> 29:30.211
Blaming me for whatever.

29:30.312 --> 29:32.880
It was his own fault.

29:32.981 --> 29:34.916
That's why this happened, you know,

29:34.983 --> 29:37.018
because he chose to be like that,

29:37.086 --> 29:40.054
and he came in like he
did, and it all happened,

29:40.155 --> 29:42.223
and he died.

29:42.324 --> 29:44.826
So don't blame yourself.

29:46.995 --> 29:49.230
I got to go.

29:49.331 --> 29:51.499
I just wanted to say that before I left.

29:51.600 --> 29:53.601
<i>What, you're... you're
just leaving now now?</i>

29:53.702 --> 29:55.937
They won't let me go back to
my place even if I wanted to.

29:56.004 --> 29:57.839
What, so you're just going to Indiana?

29:57.906 --> 29:58.906
Yep. [Chuckles]

29:59.007 --> 30:00.808
Hoosiers, here I come.

30:00.909 --> 30:03.911
My aunt already cleaned out
the guest room, she said.

30:04.012 --> 30:05.246
She has five cats,

30:05.347 --> 30:07.248
so her place probably smells like cat pee

30:07.349 --> 30:10.084
instead of beer and smoke.

30:10.185 --> 30:12.086
Man, I can't wait until I'm 18,

30:12.187 --> 30:14.122
so I can pick the way my place smells.

30:14.189 --> 30:18.292
Will you text me when you
get there so I can call you?

30:22.197 --> 30:24.265
Norman...

30:25.834 --> 30:28.736
Calling, texting...

30:30.639 --> 30:31.873
I know myself.

30:31.940 --> 30:33.541
I'm not gonna do that.

30:38.781 --> 30:43.551
Isn't it better to just
say good-bye right now,

30:43.652 --> 30:47.955
face-to-face, when
it's still real?

31:02.137 --> 31:03.905
Your mom at the Sheriff's station...

31:03.972 --> 31:06.507
she warned me not to
talk about your blackouts.

31:06.608 --> 31:07.975
Oh, yeah, I know.

31:08.043 --> 31:09.911
She didn't want them to get the wrong idea.

31:09.978 --> 31:12.180
- I know.
- No, she begged me.

31:12.247 --> 31:14.248
She said something happens to you in them.

31:14.349 --> 31:17.251
You change. They can make you do things.

31:17.352 --> 31:20.087
What? What happens to me?

31:20.155 --> 31:23.090
I don't know, but she knows,

31:23.158 --> 31:25.092
and you got to make her tell you, Norman,

31:25.160 --> 31:28.896
'cause whatever it is, it
scares the shit out of her.

31:31.133 --> 31:34.068
[Engine turning over]

31:48.150 --> 31:51.118
[Vehicle approaching]

32:00.829 --> 32:02.630
Hey.

32:06.168 --> 32:08.102
I, uh... I just wanted to
come by and tell you, uh,

32:08.203 --> 32:09.604
Jimmy Brennen's death

32:09.705 --> 32:12.573
has been officially ruled an accident.

32:12.641 --> 32:15.076
[Sighs]

32:15.177 --> 32:16.944
Okay, so that's it?

32:17.012 --> 32:18.579
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

32:18.647 --> 32:21.215
Yeah, it ended up being
pretty straightforward.

32:21.283 --> 32:25.753
I'm sorry Norman had to go through that.

32:25.821 --> 32:26.954
Okay. Thank you...

32:27.022 --> 32:28.689
No, thank you for... for being patient,

32:28.757 --> 32:31.192
and, you know, um...

32:31.293 --> 32:32.994
I'll, uh... I'll talk to you later.

32:33.095 --> 32:35.296
- Okay.
- All right.

32:38.667 --> 32:41.802
[Engine turning over]

32:48.110 --> 32:52.546
Norman!

32:52.648 --> 32:54.482
Norman!

32:54.583 --> 32:56.050
Norman.

32:56.118 --> 32:58.719
Norman, Sheriff Romero just stopped by.

32:58.820 --> 33:00.554
The investigation... it's done.

33:00.656 --> 33:02.790
It's over. They ruled it an accident.

33:02.858 --> 33:04.892
Oh, my God.

33:04.960 --> 33:08.663
Oh, my God, I'm so relieved.

33:11.833 --> 33:15.736
I can see that. Cody was here earlier.

33:15.837 --> 33:18.005
- Was she?
- Yeah, she's leaving.

33:18.106 --> 33:21.208
She's, uh... she's moving to
Indiana to be with her aunt.

33:21.310 --> 33:22.243
Right now?

33:22.344 --> 33:25.012
- Forever?
- Mm-hmm.

33:25.113 --> 33:27.581
Well, for your sake, I'm sorry.

33:27.683 --> 33:29.183
I know you'll miss her,

33:29.251 --> 33:32.253
but sometimes a fresh start's
good for the soul, right?

33:37.960 --> 33:42.029
I'm glad she came over to
say good-bye to you, though.

33:42.130 --> 33:46.968
She came over to tell me
that, uh, you're lying to me...

33:49.871 --> 33:51.539
That there's something really wrong with me

33:51.606 --> 33:53.140
and that you know what it is.

33:56.778 --> 33:58.212
That girl could've ruined

33:58.313 --> 34:01.215
your entire life the other night.

34:01.316 --> 34:03.884
Have you missed the fact that
she's not a stable person?

34:03.986 --> 34:06.520
No, you told her something
happens to me when I black out.

34:06.621 --> 34:07.955
Norman.

34:08.056 --> 34:09.924
You said I change, that I'm not myself.

34:09.992 --> 34:12.827
Who am I, mother? Who
am I, and what do I do?

34:12.893 --> 34:15.629
Norman...

34:19.167 --> 34:21.936
I love you so much.

34:22.004 --> 34:24.972
[Sniffles]

34:25.072 --> 34:29.010
And I did say those things.

34:29.110 --> 34:31.078
And they are true.

34:33.882 --> 34:36.117
But we are not gonna talk about them.

34:36.184 --> 34:37.752
What?

34:37.819 --> 34:41.188
You have to trust that I am protecting you,

34:41.289 --> 34:43.657
I know you better than anyone,

34:43.759 --> 34:46.193
because I'm not gonna answer your question,

34:46.293 --> 34:50.097
and I don't want you to ever ask me again!

35:00.675 --> 35:03.677
[Door closes]

35:18.044 --> 35:20.145

35:20.213 --> 35:23.749

35:28.321 --> 35:30.756
Yeah.

Now's the time. Come with us.

35:33.660 --> 35:35.828
Come where?

35:43.870 --> 35:46.005
Yeah? What's that?

35:46.106 --> 35:47.940
If you come with us, you'll know.

35:48.041 --> 35:51.610
Come on, you can't watch me
if you don't come with me.

35:51.711 --> 35:54.580

35:54.681 --> 35:56.282
Let's not forget about Remo.

35:56.349 --> 35:59.952
Yeah, he's gonna go
with, uh, Chuck and Sid.

36:03.957 --> 36:06.258

36:10.263 --> 36:13.132
You're gonna ride with us. Come on.

Look, think this through.

38:31.237 --> 38:32.704
You don't think I have?

38:32.806 --> 38:34.973
We're telling them,

38:35.074 --> 38:36.742
you go up against us,

38:36.810 --> 38:38.811
it's gonna be five times
more painful for them.

38:38.912 --> 38:41.780
- We're sending them a message.
- That's not the right message.

38:41.881 --> 38:44.249
It's too big, all right?

38:44.350 --> 38:47.286
- And everything about it's wrong.
- Too big?

38:47.353 --> 38:50.823
Too big for me, you mean.

38:50.890 --> 38:52.658
Who's it gonna be big enough for?

38:52.725 --> 38:55.661
What do you think they're
gonna do back to us, huh?

38:55.728 --> 38:57.663
You... you think they're just gonna stop?

38:57.730 --> 39:01.333
I just need you to tell me...

39:01.434 --> 39:05.704
Are you with me or not?

39:07.106 --> 39:09.107
I'm not.

39:18.718 --> 39:21.119
I'm not gonna kill you...

39:24.123 --> 39:26.925
But I can't promise you they won't.

39:28.761 --> 39:29.928
How about you?

39:32.298 --> 39:33.732
I'm with you.

39:33.833 --> 39:37.870

- It's Deputy Lin.

41:12.265 --> 41:13.598

- It matched.
