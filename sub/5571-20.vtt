WEBVTT

00:08.542 --> 00:10.175
Tony:
Aha.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.644
Would you like a glass
of bubbly, director?

00:12.646 --> 00:14.480
No drinking on the clock,
agent DiNozzo.

00:14.482 --> 00:15.581
Of course not, sir.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.116
And why deprive the politicians?

00:17.117 --> 00:18.650
Most of them have not had
a drink since this morning.

00:19.687 --> 00:23.022
Mrs. bransfield,
nice to see you again.

00:23.024 --> 00:24.223
Excuse me.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.491
Hi.

00:25.493 --> 00:26.492
You don't have
a wristband.

00:26.494 --> 00:29.194
Ooh, you got me.
No wristband.

00:29.196 --> 00:32.498
The line was just kind of crazy
outside, so we let ourselves in.

00:32.500 --> 00:36.101
Name?
I'm very special agent
Anthony DiNozzo, NCIS.

00:36.103 --> 00:39.338
We were expecting a
special agent Gibbs.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.540
(Chuckles)
Well, consider yourself lucky.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.142
He's not really
a people person.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.343
He's more of a...

00:44.345 --> 00:45.878
Basement person.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.412
The invitations are
non-transferrable.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.148
Uh, is there
a problem, miss...?

00:49.150 --> 00:51.316
Marsden, director.
Senator Kelly's aide.

00:51.318 --> 00:53.052
Ah, miss marsden.

00:53.054 --> 00:55.187
I'm sure that the senator
wouldn't object if we had...

00:55.189 --> 00:56.188
Man:
Director Vance,

00:56.190 --> 00:57.356
who let you in here?

00:57.358 --> 00:58.624
Thank you, Lisa.

00:58.626 --> 01:01.160
You invited Secnav,
you invite us.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.361
Senator Kelly,
how's the racquetball game?

01:02.363 --> 01:04.229
Ah, still have
a few good shots left.

01:04.231 --> 01:05.464
You remember
senator bransfield?

01:05.466 --> 01:07.132
Well, of course I do.
Nice to see you.

01:07.134 --> 01:08.667
And this is
one of our best,

01:08.669 --> 01:10.302
special agent Anthony DiNozzo.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.171
Tony:
It's a pleasure, senators.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.339
Bransfield:
Uh...

01:14.341 --> 01:16.675
I...

01:16.677 --> 01:18.644
Would you, uh...

01:18.646 --> 01:20.712
Would you excuse me
a second, please?

01:20.714 --> 01:23.348
Excuse me.
(Clears throat)

01:23.350 --> 01:25.651
It's good to see you, Leon.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.653
Pardon me
while I make the rounds.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.321
By all means.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.359
What the hell was that?

01:34.361 --> 01:36.161
(Chuckles):
I don't know.

01:36.163 --> 01:39.431
I usually only have
that effect on women.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.701
Can't say I know a lot about
her music, but she's Katy Perry.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.704
She's got... she's got
the fiery hair.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.406
Roar! (Laughs)

01:47.408 --> 01:49.475
(Tony mutters)

01:50.711 --> 01:52.878
Ah. Senator bransfield.

01:52.880 --> 01:56.115
Don't you "senator" me,
you despicable piece of filth.

01:57.485 --> 01:59.384
What are you doing
showing up here?

01:59.386 --> 02:01.587
We weren't supposed
to meet till tonight.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.789
I'm sorry?
Oh, really?

02:03.791 --> 02:05.424
You're sorry?

02:05.426 --> 02:07.192
You will be

02:07.194 --> 02:09.561
if you ever try
to contact me again.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.899
You see that?

02:13.901 --> 02:16.568
I hope you choke on it.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.680
¶ ¶

02:56.577 --> 02:58.644
Tony (Whispers):
$500.

03:00.581 --> 03:04.616
$20,000.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.585
USS<i> Theodore Roosevelt.</i>

03:07.555 --> 03:09.354
Taken.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.556
USS<i> constitution.</i>

03:10.558 --> 03:11.657
Also taken.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.392
USS<i> fortitude?</i>

03:13.394 --> 03:14.593
Ooh, I like that one.
Mm-hmm.

03:14.595 --> 03:17.629
It conveys strength
and determination.

03:17.631 --> 03:20.465
No. It's already taken.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.534
Damn.
Yup. Minesweeper in
world war two.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.470
What about you, Tony?
A little busy right now.

03:25.472 --> 03:27.472
Bishop:
Doing...

03:27.474 --> 03:28.674
What?

03:30.344 --> 03:32.211
Okay.

03:32.213 --> 03:32.878
Tony.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.646
I don't want to play.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.348
Look, we're naming aircraft
carriers, okay?

03:36.350 --> 03:37.950
Whatever comes to
your head first.
Don't even think about it.

03:37.952 --> 03:39.585
Just whatever comes
to your head first. What is it?

03:39.587 --> 03:41.453
Peanut.

03:41.455 --> 03:42.821
What's the second thing
that pops in your head?

03:42.823 --> 03:43.889
Brett favre.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.998
Okay, does this look like
the USS<i> peanut</i> to you?

03:53.000 --> 03:55.267
The USS<i> Brett favre?</i>

03:55.269 --> 03:56.735
Make him stop talking to me.

03:56.737 --> 03:57.869
Tony, this is important.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.538
A new aircraft carrier

03:59.540 --> 04:00.806
is being announced next month,

04:00.808 --> 04:03.609
and Secnav is holding
a contest to name it.

04:03.611 --> 04:04.810
Tony, do you realize

04:04.811 --> 04:06.010
what a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity this is?

04:06.013 --> 04:08.614
You get to emblazon
the name of your choice

04:08.616 --> 04:11.683
on a state-of-the-art,
nuclear-powered vessel

04:11.685 --> 04:14.519
that's protecting the greatest
country in the world.

04:14.521 --> 04:16.421
Let's put a pin in
that, mcmilitary,

04:16.423 --> 04:18.824
and talk about
my problem.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.761
$20,000.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.296
And why is that a problem?

04:24.298 --> 04:26.531
Because technically,
it might be stolen.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.000
By who?
By me.

04:28.702 --> 04:29.801
DiNozzo!

04:30.971 --> 04:32.804
Oh, hey. You're here.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.439
That's good.

04:34.441 --> 04:35.607
Gibbs, what's the matter?

04:35.609 --> 04:37.609
I just got a phone call.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.311
A deputy in Virginia

04:39.313 --> 04:42.314
just found an NCIS special agent
dead in a car crash.

04:42.316 --> 04:43.682
Oh, my god,
that's terrible.

04:43.684 --> 04:44.850
Who died?

04:44.852 --> 04:47.586
You did.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.960
Tony: Yes, that's my name,
but it's not my photo.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.562
It's obviously a fake.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.799
How do I know
you're really you?

05:00.801 --> 05:03.735
How do I know<i> you're</i> really you?

05:03.737 --> 05:05.671
Hi.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.306
NCIS special agent McGee.

05:07.308 --> 05:08.640
Um, where'd you get the badge?

05:08.642 --> 05:11.843
Front pocket
of the driver's jacket.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.347
He's deceased.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.748
Mm.

05:16.750 --> 05:17.749
Yeah, we gathered that.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.685
Um, can we take
a look at that?

05:19.687 --> 05:22.421
Seeing as the victim is
not an actual NCIS agent,

05:22.423 --> 05:24.690
and seeing as he died
within our jurisdiction,

05:24.692 --> 05:26.992
sheriff's department will take
lead in this investigation.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.561
How is the investigation going?

05:29.563 --> 05:31.396
Special agent Gibbs.

05:31.398 --> 05:33.765
Deputy sheriff Hicks.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.734
So talk to me, deputy.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.669
A one-car crash, broad daylight.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.004
My guess, the guy was drunk.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.772
Or asleep.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.674
Bishop:
Gibbs!

05:42.676 --> 05:44.810
Over here!

05:44.812 --> 05:46.812
Skid marks.
Two sets of them.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.580
Here and over here.

05:48.582 --> 05:51.116
There was a second
vehicle involved.

05:51.118 --> 05:54.786
McGee: Hey, boss, got
something you got to see here.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.688
White paint.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.924
Looks like our victim got tapped
by another vehicle.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.359
Maybe forced
off the road.

06:02.363 --> 06:03.862
How's that investigation
going now, Hicks?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.397
Guess it could have been
a hit-and-run.

06:05.399 --> 06:07.499
Guess we'll have to take
a closer look.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.901
Ducky: Investigators
don't guess, deputy.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.970
They study. They analyze.

06:11.972 --> 06:14.139
They make inferences
based on evidence

06:14.141 --> 06:15.941
and facts.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.442
What do you got, duck?

06:17.444 --> 06:19.644
Ducky: Well, what happens
when a immovable object

06:19.646 --> 06:20.746
meets a unstoppable force?

06:20.748 --> 06:22.765
In this case,

06:22.766 --> 06:24.783
the driver was pinned
under the steering wheel.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.985
Other than hypothesize,
I'm going to wait

06:26.987 --> 06:30.389
until the firefighters
extract his body.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.991
Found something! (Grunts)

06:32.993 --> 06:36.027
(Sighs)

06:36.029 --> 06:36.995
What's inside?

06:36.997 --> 06:39.931
I don't know.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.666
But I think I know.

06:41.668 --> 06:42.834
That's evidence.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.773
(Sighs)

06:53.847 --> 06:55.080
Hicks:
So, uh...

06:55.082 --> 06:59.050
So DiNozzo was rich, huh?

06:59.052 --> 07:00.819
Living the dream.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.828
Tony: Yes, "fraud" is
a really good name for it.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.196
Can you please cancel the card?

07:11.198 --> 07:13.031
Much appreciate it. Huh?

07:13.033 --> 07:14.933
Oh, I'd love to take a survey.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.935
A United States senator

07:16.937 --> 07:18.870
gives you $20,000,

07:18.872 --> 07:20.439
and you don't think
to mention it?

07:20.441 --> 07:22.441
I wanted some answers first,
boss.

07:22.443 --> 07:24.910
What do we know?

07:24.912 --> 07:26.578
Bishop:
Our victim's name is

07:26.580 --> 07:28.547
Scott byers.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.583
Hmm.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.118
Uh, technical issues.
Please stand by.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.223
Scott byers is,
uh, 35 years old,

07:38.225 --> 07:39.925
lived in roanoke, Virginia.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.159
Part-time waiter,

07:41.161 --> 07:42.527
part-time uber driver.

07:42.529 --> 07:44.296
No prior record.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.064
And no apparent connection
to senator bransfield.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.467
Never even voted.
How'd he get
DiNozzo's badge and I.D.?

07:48.469 --> 07:49.868
Tony:
Don't look at me.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.603
I didn't give it to him.

07:51.605 --> 07:52.938
Well-made forgeries.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.906
We're looking into
known counterfeiting operations.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.007
Bishop:
Got it.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.108
Loose connection.

08:01.682 --> 08:02.981
Tony:
Oh, wow.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.584
Really is a phony Tony.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.252
Bishop: Now we know
why he stole Tony's identity.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.920
McGee:
Working theory is that

08:08.922 --> 08:11.156
byers impersonated Tony,
ran up the cards,

08:11.158 --> 08:13.124
and then extorted
senator bransfield.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.226
You find byers' cell phone?

08:14.228 --> 08:16.161
No. Maybe he didn't have one,

08:16.163 --> 08:18.063
which seems odd
for a blackmailer.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.031
So what did he have

08:20.033 --> 08:22.234
on bransfield that was
worth paying 20 grand?

08:22.236 --> 08:24.135
Yeah, that's
an excellent question.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.937
And I just hung up
with the senator,

08:25.939 --> 08:28.707
who has very graciously agreed
to come down and talk to us.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.243
Oh, boy.

08:31.245 --> 08:35.013
An object in motion
tends to stay in motion,

08:35.015 --> 08:38.984
uh, in the same speed
in the same direction,

08:38.986 --> 08:43.088
unless acted on
by an unbalanced force.

08:43.090 --> 08:47.158
That's Isaac Newton's law
of inertia, Mr. byers.

08:47.160 --> 08:51.963
You challenged that law,
and now you know the rest.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.532
Ah, Timothy.

08:53.534 --> 08:55.066
What a pleasant surprise.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.134
Hey, ducky.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.903
I am playing
the part of Gibbs today.

08:57.905 --> 09:01.139
And this fellow's playing
the part of Anthony DiNozzo.

09:01.141 --> 09:04.743
Who knew that DiNozzo
had a stand-in in the wings?

09:04.745 --> 09:06.411
So what do you got?

09:06.412 --> 09:08.078
Massive damage
to multiple organs.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.214
Severe hemorrhaging.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.550
Death was due
to blunt force trauma

09:11.552 --> 09:14.119
from the car
hitting the light pole.

09:14.121 --> 09:17.055
So it was the car crash
that killed him.
Indeed.

09:17.057 --> 09:22.060
Oh, and also I located
Mr. byers' missing cell phone.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.595
Oh, that's good news.

09:23.596 --> 09:25.129
We need to find out who
he was in contact with.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.067
Phone is in the bowl?

09:29.069 --> 09:31.136
Most of it.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.204
The rest is embedded
in his quadriceps.

09:33.206 --> 09:35.073
What, the phone
was inside his leg?

09:35.075 --> 09:37.108
It was in
his pants pocket.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.878
It shattered
when the car crashed,

09:39.880 --> 09:42.113
and the pieces, I say,
embedded in his thigh.

09:42.115 --> 09:44.716
Well, so much for
getting those contacts.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.351
I think it's safe to say

09:46.353 --> 09:49.854
that his last contact
was with the pole.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.058
(Chuckles)

09:53.060 --> 09:55.627
I made a joke.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.633
Wow.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.234
You cut the car in half.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.869
No. (Chuckles)
The firefighters did.

10:04.871 --> 10:06.104
They were already
slicing it up

10:06.106 --> 10:08.106
to try to extricate
phony Tony,

10:08.108 --> 10:10.075
so I just asked them to
go ahead and bisect it.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.610
It's easier to
work like this.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.144
Oh. Well, tell me
you found something.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.346
I found something.

10:14.348 --> 10:17.282
Bishop:
A... scrape?

10:17.284 --> 10:21.252
To the naked eye,
it is a scrape.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.054
But inside,

10:23.056 --> 10:26.891
at ten times magnification,
we find...

10:29.029 --> 10:30.629
...chlorine and ethylene.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.097
Do you know
what that is?

10:32.099 --> 10:33.865
Gibbs is really good
at my games,

10:33.867 --> 10:34.899
but you'll catch on.

10:34.901 --> 10:36.134
So...

10:36.136 --> 10:38.803
So it's the chemical composition
for vinyl.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.105
What's made out of vinyl?

10:40.107 --> 10:41.306
Records?

10:41.308 --> 10:43.208
Bumper stickers.
Oh.

10:43.210 --> 10:47.212
I bet this shred scraped off
when the two cars collided.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.114
Can you tell me
what the bumper sticker says?

10:49.116 --> 10:52.150
Based on a shred
that's 3.2 millimeters long?

10:52.152 --> 10:53.852
No.

10:53.854 --> 10:57.022
Ooh, you have something else,
don't you?

10:57.024 --> 10:59.141
I do.

10:59.142 --> 11:01.259
And you know that because
you saw my spectrophotometer.

11:01.261 --> 11:04.195
Visible light is
measured in nanometers.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.197
That's a billionth of a meter;
It's very small.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.033
But with this machine, my...

11:08.035 --> 11:10.235
Spectro...
Spectrophotometer.

11:10.237 --> 11:13.705
It's got
a color analyzing wheel

11:13.707 --> 11:15.440
and inference filters
and a stepper motor...

11:15.442 --> 11:16.675
Abby.

11:16.677 --> 11:19.277
Get to the good part.

11:19.279 --> 11:22.113
Okay. Well, put this

11:22.115 --> 11:25.150
on the color,
push a button...

11:25.152 --> 11:27.686
And ta-da!

11:28.822 --> 11:29.721
Arctic beach.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.456
That's the color.

11:31.457 --> 11:33.190
It was really common in
luxury European models

11:33.193 --> 11:34.259
in the early '70s,

11:34.261 --> 11:37.796
so if you can find
an old white BMW

11:37.798 --> 11:40.732
or Mercedes with a dent
and a torn bumper sticker,

11:40.734 --> 11:42.200
you'll find your killer.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.235
Thanks, Abby. Thank your gizmo.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.871
Thank you, gizmo.

11:46.873 --> 11:50.241
Senator, I'm truly sorry
for any misunderstanding.

11:50.243 --> 11:54.212
It's, uh... well, it's kind of
funny, when you think about it.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.281
Hilarious, even.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.916
Not hilarious.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.854
It's kooky.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.889
(Knocking on door)
Come in.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.394
Senator.

12:09.396 --> 12:12.197
Hilarious.

12:12.199 --> 12:15.867
I'm truly sorry
for any misunderstanding.

12:15.869 --> 12:18.269
Anyway, here we are,
conference room.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.338
Now we get to confer.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.307
Jason, will you
wait outside, please?

12:23.376 --> 12:25.210
That's a good idea.

12:25.212 --> 12:27.278
You got a lot of nerve
pulling me in here.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.247
Now, you listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.149
I'll give you
$20,000 more.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.383
That is my Max.

12:32.385 --> 12:33.818
(Door opens)

12:36.490 --> 12:39.491
Special agent Gibbs.

12:39.493 --> 12:42.026
Senator. Thanks for coming.

12:42.028 --> 12:44.195
Special agent DiNozzo
get you up to speed?

12:44.197 --> 12:45.230
Well, I was
just explaining

12:45.232 --> 12:47.265
to the senator that, um,

12:47.267 --> 12:49.400
he was being blackmailed
by an imposter

12:49.402 --> 12:51.069
who stole my identity.

12:51.071 --> 12:52.504
And we

12:52.506 --> 12:56.407
are returning your $20,000,

12:56.409 --> 12:58.309
not a penny short.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.779
(Chuckles)

13:00.781 --> 13:02.914
How long has this extortion
been going on?

13:02.916 --> 13:04.849
Uh, several weeks.

13:04.851 --> 13:06.317
He would ask me to put the money

13:06.319 --> 13:08.553
in a trash can
over at the soccer field.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.789
I never met the guy,
obviously, so...

13:10.791 --> 13:12.457
You saw me at the party;

13:12.458 --> 13:14.124
you thought that I came
to collect the money personally.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.360
Yeah.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.128
We'd like to access
your phone and e-mail.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.063
Trace your correspondence.

13:20.133 --> 13:23.902
Well, if I gave you
access to my phone,

13:23.904 --> 13:27.272
you'd find out
why I was being blackmailed.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.045
(Sighs)

13:34.047 --> 13:36.114
Look, gentlemen, I'm...

13:36.116 --> 13:37.482
I'm not proud of this.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.518
I'm hoping
it doesn't go public.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.354
But if it helps you
catch that bastard...

13:45.158 --> 13:48.126
Okay. There you go.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.595
Actually, senator,
your blackmailer is dead.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.097
Someone ran him
off the road yesterday.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.436
Well...

13:59.873 --> 14:02.240
Looks like my little
problem is solved, huh?

14:02.242 --> 14:03.474
Am I free to go?

14:03.476 --> 14:05.376
The guy stole my identity,
senator.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.946
We still have
a murder investigation.

14:07.948 --> 14:12.150
Well, my office wishes you
nothing but luck.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.119
(Sighs)

14:18.959 --> 14:21.593
Gibbs...

14:21.595 --> 14:24.295
I did something bad.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.397
How bad?

14:26.399 --> 14:28.132
<i>Bad</i> bad.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.371
So I hacked into
senator bransfield's e-mail

14:33.373 --> 14:35.273
while he was sitting in there.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.475
The government should be ashamed
of their firewalls.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.410
Anyways, our trusted
elected official

14:39.412 --> 14:42.380
cannot be trusted
to keep his hands to himself.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.315
Tony (Chuckles):
Oh-ho-ho.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.917
That's not Mrs. bransfield.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.151
He kept this e-mail?

14:47.153 --> 14:48.486
No, he deleted it.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.488
I just...
Un-deleted it.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.390
But you have to see the
note that came with it.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.493
"You've been
a naughty boy, senator.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.396
"Pay me $20,000 or I'm
sending these to the press.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.431
"Instructions to follow.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.234
Love, NCIS special agent
Tony DiNozzo."

15:03.236 --> 15:05.403
Well, it's kind of sweet.
He said "love, Tony."

15:05.405 --> 15:07.639
You got any shots
of the woman's face?

15:07.641 --> 15:09.040
No, sorry.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.509
Can you get an I.D. On her?

15:11.511 --> 15:12.911
Well, sure, Gibbs.

15:12.913 --> 15:16.247
I'll just push
my "identify a stranger

15:16.249 --> 15:17.615
"based solely on the back

15:17.617 --> 15:19.584
of their head" button.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.619
Why don't you just ask
the senator who she is?

15:21.621 --> 15:22.987
Can't do that.

15:22.989 --> 15:24.555
He'll know we hacked
into his private e-mail.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.024
Whoa! Gibbs.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.458
You should see this.

15:27.460 --> 15:31.496
Senator bransfield just got
a new e-mail.

15:32.432 --> 15:35.033
"Senator,
you stood me up last night.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.534
"Now the price goes up
to $40,000.

15:36.536 --> 15:39.103
Same drop zone.
Love, Tony."

15:39.105 --> 15:40.138
Okay.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.539
So either phony Tony

15:41.541 --> 15:43.708
is sending e-mails
from the grave or...

15:43.710 --> 15:46.377
There's another phony Tony.

15:54.354 --> 15:58.222
Senator bransfield,
it's special agent Tony DiNozzo.

15:58.224 --> 16:00.058
Yes, the real one.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.259
Morning, Ellie.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.328
Well, good morning, Tim.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.530
Ah, the ship-
naming contest.

16:05.532 --> 16:07.098
I'm gonna win this thing.
(Chuckles)

16:07.100 --> 16:08.366
How many names you got on there?

16:08.368 --> 16:10.301
I don't know. Couple dozen.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.736
It looks more like 50.

16:11.737 --> 16:13.170
I got to tell you,
the brainstorming session

16:13.173 --> 16:14.706
last night was out of control.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.240
Delilah and I came up with
so many choices.

16:16.242 --> 16:17.542
We were up till late night

16:17.544 --> 16:21.179
researching each name's
cultural, political

16:21.181 --> 16:23.214
and historical
significance.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.216
Um... McGee,

16:25.218 --> 16:26.985
you know you're
only allowed

16:26.987 --> 16:29.320
one entry per person?

16:32.225 --> 16:34.659
Okay. Senators are on board.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.494
You think Gibbs
will go for it?
Go for what?

16:36.496 --> 16:37.729
Um...

16:37.731 --> 16:39.731
Come on. Talk.

16:39.733 --> 16:43.301
Gibbs, senator bransfield isn't
the only senator being extorted.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.336
McGee: We traced the
e-mail sent to bransfield

16:45.338 --> 16:46.671
that Abby intercepted.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.773
Same account holder
sent extortion e-mails

16:48.775 --> 16:50.308
to two other senators.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.310
Let me guess.
Senator Shawn Kelly?

16:52.312 --> 16:55.380
Explains why he ran away from me
when we met at his fundraiser.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.015
The other one
is senator will Matheson.

16:59.085 --> 17:01.386
The blackmailer's dead.

17:01.388 --> 17:04.422
Senator Kelly's blackmailer
is dead.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.224
Let's call him
phony Tony number one.

17:07.293 --> 17:10.294
Bransfield's is still out there.

17:10.296 --> 17:13.131
Let's call him
phony Tony number two.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.534
What about senator Matheson?
McGee: Blackmailed by

17:16.536 --> 17:18.269
phony Tony
number three.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.306
So, DiNozzo, you got your
identity stolen three times?

17:22.308 --> 17:23.374
Ah, yes.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.109
Uh, that appears to be the case.

17:25.111 --> 17:26.444
But I'm gonna
make up for it now,

17:26.446 --> 17:28.046
because I came up
with a new plan

17:28.048 --> 17:30.315
to catch the remaining
blackmailers.

17:30.316 --> 17:32.583
When Matheson and bransfield
make their payoff later today,

17:32.585 --> 17:35.119
we will be there
to arrest them.

17:35.121 --> 17:38.222
We're not using United States
senators as decoys in a sting.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.258
Oh, no.
Of course not.

17:40.260 --> 17:44.128
Gibbs, I'd like you to meet
senator will Matheson.

17:44.130 --> 17:45.430
Vote for me in November.

17:45.432 --> 17:46.764
Senator Matheson,

17:46.766 --> 17:48.733
you remember
senator bransfield?

17:50.804 --> 17:52.537
Good to meet you
again, senator.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.473
Okay.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.542
Let's go con the cons.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.344
Man:
Score a goal!

18:00.346 --> 18:02.380
All right, guys.
Man 2: Go. Go, go!

18:02.382 --> 18:04.365
Let's go, girls!
Come on, let's get one!

18:04.366 --> 18:06.349
All right!
(Crowd cheering,
girls squealing)

18:06.352 --> 18:08.786
See any potential
phony Tonys?

18:08.788 --> 18:11.856
You mean middle-aged men
with wandering eyes?

18:11.858 --> 18:13.491
You got the bird's-eye view.

18:13.493 --> 18:15.393
(Chuckles)

18:15.395 --> 18:17.361
Bishop:
Well, I see you.

18:17.363 --> 18:19.197
A little grayer than normal.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.665
Politics ages a man.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.201
All right,
I'm gonna do the drop.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.470
Now, remember, he has to
physically have the money

18:25.472 --> 18:28.106
before you arrest him, okay?

18:28.108 --> 18:30.708
Thanks for the bribery advice,
senator.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.710
You're a little
too good at this.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.361
(Sighs)

18:50.363 --> 18:51.496
Senator?

18:55.435 --> 18:57.635
Agent DiNozzo?

18:59.572 --> 19:01.205
That's me.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.676
Bishop:
Here we go.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.545
Homeless guy.

19:07.547 --> 19:10.481
Doesn't really look like Tony.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.483
McGee:
Well, give him a few years.

19:14.454 --> 19:15.486
Bishop:
Ugh.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.488
Not him.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.728
$20,000.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.667
It's all there.

19:41.481 --> 19:44.315
Got a runner.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.524
McGee:
Anthony DiNozzo.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.763
Senator?

19:58.765 --> 20:01.332
Man:
<i> You know, I got to say, uh,</i>

20:01.334 --> 20:02.800
you don't really look
like your picture.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.735
(Laughs)
Yeah.

20:04.737 --> 20:07.705
Well, neither do you.

20:13.646 --> 20:17.281
You two are
looking at 20 years

20:17.283 --> 20:19.350
for impersonating
a federal agent

20:19.352 --> 20:20.718
and bribing a
U.S. senator.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.386
Whoa, whoa, no.
Hang on, hang on.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.654
No, no,
i didn't do any bribing.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.289
All I did was pick up the money.

20:25.291 --> 20:26.857
Yeah, sh-she paid me
five grand to pick up.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.526
Has the Tony show started yet?

20:28.528 --> 20:29.594
Tony:
And who is<i> she</i> exactly?

20:29.596 --> 20:30.695
Bring popcorn?

20:30.697 --> 20:32.296
The chick that hired us.

20:32.298 --> 20:34.532
Yeah. She's the one
that set all this up.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.267
Is this a blonde chick?

20:36.269 --> 20:37.668
I...

20:37.670 --> 20:39.704
I don't know.
I-i never met her.

20:39.706 --> 20:40.938
Then how'd she hire you?

20:40.940 --> 20:41.872
Craigslist.

20:42.742 --> 20:43.741
I'm an actor.

20:43.743 --> 20:44.909
It was a casting call.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.545
She said she really
liked my head shot.

20:47.547 --> 20:49.013
Yeah, yeah, she told
me the same thing.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.448
She was super nice.
Yeah.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.515
Actually,
she-she told me that

20:51.517 --> 20:52.683
I'd get to play
a government agent.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.252
You know,
like-like Jason bourne.

20:54.254 --> 20:57.321
Instead, of course,
i get Jason boring.

20:58.391 --> 20:59.757
Uh, look the point is,

20:59.759 --> 21:02.460
a week after she hired me,

21:02.462 --> 21:03.928
this arrives in the mail,

21:03.930 --> 21:05.796
along with your badge
and I.D.,

21:05.798 --> 21:07.632
your credit card,
your backstory.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.300
I committed
everything to memory.

21:09.302 --> 21:11.502
(Clicks tongue)
Just like memorizing lines.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.704
We know everything about you.
Yeah.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.673
What's my mother's maiden name?

21:15.675 --> 21:16.841
Oh, that's easy.

21:16.843 --> 21:18.509
Paddington.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.478
And how long
have I been working for NCIS?

21:20.480 --> 21:22.546
Yeah, long enough that you
should be making better money.

21:22.548 --> 21:25.616
Wait for it, wait for it.
Yep, you're pathetic.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.286
I'm not even that good
at memorizing lines.

21:28.288 --> 21:29.487
You were easy!

21:29.489 --> 21:30.888
You have no life.
That's true.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.991
Yeah, no wife, no kids,
uh, no hobbies.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.559
Same job, same apartment.

21:35.561 --> 21:36.627
(Chuckles):
I mean,

21:36.629 --> 21:38.496
nothing changes with you.

21:38.498 --> 21:39.563
What a fun conversation.

21:39.565 --> 21:40.564
Yeah.

21:40.566 --> 21:42.566
Hey, I've got an idea.

21:42.568 --> 21:44.035
Let's call your boss.

21:44.037 --> 21:46.037
Sorry, uh, no can do.

21:46.039 --> 21:47.605
Mm-mm.
No, no, yeah.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.190
She calls us.

21:49.191 --> 21:50.774
Tells us when and where
to pick up the money.

21:50.777 --> 21:52.376
Where do you drop it off?

21:54.314 --> 21:56.681
(Sighs)

21:56.683 --> 21:58.649
Bus station.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.419
Massachusetts Avenue.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.421
Locker 177.

22:07.727 --> 22:11.562
Right, so there was one camera
pointed at locker 177.

22:11.564 --> 22:14.332
This is at 3:22 P.M.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.000
On Saturday afternoon.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.369
There's the smaller Tony
making a drop.

22:18.371 --> 22:19.937
Tiny.
Then we fast-forward

22:19.939 --> 22:21.639
two hours ahead.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.941
And here comes
tall, handsome Tony.

22:23.943 --> 22:24.975
He's really cute,
by the way.

22:24.977 --> 22:26.010
I mean,

22:26.012 --> 22:28.512
not nearly as cute as you are.

22:28.514 --> 22:31.615
Not even close.

22:31.617 --> 22:34.352
Okay, 11:54 P.M.,

22:34.354 --> 22:38.756
here comes
our mystery woman.

22:38.758 --> 22:40.858
Please tell me
she turns around.
She turns around.

22:43.029 --> 22:45.129
Oh, boy.

22:45.131 --> 22:46.130
I know.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.665
I think that is the woman

22:47.667 --> 22:49.667
that was kissing
senator bransfield.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.836
(Sighs)

22:51.838 --> 22:53.037
Wait.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.438
You know her.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.673
Yeah, I know her.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.074
I dated her.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.490
Who the hell is she?

23:12.492 --> 23:13.975
I don't know.

23:13.976 --> 23:15.459
You don't know?
She was in your apartment.

23:15.461 --> 23:16.727
I've had lots of women
in my apartment.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.596
This one stole
your identity.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.598
Did you happen
to catch her name, DiNozzo,

23:20.600 --> 23:22.933
or is that not the way
that dates work anymore?

23:22.935 --> 23:24.802
McGee: Boss, she told
Tony that her name was

23:24.804 --> 23:26.504
Leah Ramsey-- that's
not her real name.

23:26.506 --> 23:28.639
Bishop: 18 Leah ramseys have
social security numbers

23:28.641 --> 23:29.974
in the United States.

23:29.976 --> 23:32.610
Not one matches
her age and description.

23:32.612 --> 23:34.145
Does she have a phone, DiNozzo?

23:34.147 --> 23:35.980
Look, she gave me
her e-mail,

23:35.982 --> 23:38.482
which I threw away, because i
never intended to see her again.

23:38.484 --> 23:39.817
Well, how did you contact
her the first time?

23:39.819 --> 23:41.018
I met her at a bar.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.953
(Chuckles) Let me guess.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.422
She approached you.

23:44.424 --> 23:47.558
Well, they usually do, but I...

23:47.560 --> 23:48.993
I was a target.

23:48.995 --> 23:50.428
An easy one!

23:50.430 --> 23:53.731
Bishop: So, we've got
three extorted senators,

23:53.733 --> 23:55.733
uh, two arrested bagmen

23:55.735 --> 23:57.768
and one identified suspect.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.437
And zero leads!

23:59.439 --> 24:00.604
Come on!

24:00.606 --> 24:02.673
We're smarter than this!

24:04.777 --> 24:06.177
(Sighs)

24:06.179 --> 24:07.945
(Whispers):
I think we're in trouble.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.613
Yeah.

24:11.451 --> 24:12.883
Thanks for coming over, Abby.

24:12.885 --> 24:15.119
I needed another set of eyes.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.121
Of course.
It's an honor.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.490
I haven't been to the
inner sanctum in a while.

24:19.492 --> 24:21.459
Welcome back to casa DiNozzo.

24:21.461 --> 24:23.461
I wish it was under
better circumstances.

24:23.463 --> 24:25.229
And I get to say hello

24:25.231 --> 24:27.865
to Kate and Ziva
in their cute little bowl.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.934
Yeah, Ziva's gained
a little weight.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.202
(Chuckles)

24:31.204 --> 24:32.570
You can drop by anytime.

24:32.572 --> 24:33.237
Senior does.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.573
I think it's really sweet

24:35.575 --> 24:38.242
that you two get to spend
more time together.

24:38.244 --> 24:40.878
Maybe someone will start
impersonating him, too.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.481
So, how do you
think Leah did it?

24:43.483 --> 24:44.515
I don't know.

24:44.517 --> 24:46.784
I-i went to the kitchen.

24:46.786 --> 24:51.121
So... maybe in those 30 seconds,
she used a flash drive

24:51.123 --> 24:54.191
or a camera on her cell phone.

25:03.503 --> 25:06.170
Do you feel violated?

25:06.172 --> 25:08.506
Yes, and not the way I like.

25:08.508 --> 25:09.573
Wait.

25:10.710 --> 25:13.611
Tony...

25:13.613 --> 25:15.012
You don't have a cat.

25:15.014 --> 25:15.880
(Chuckles):
Oh, yeah.

25:15.882 --> 25:18.516
That.

25:18.518 --> 25:19.884
Or a dog.

25:19.886 --> 25:21.519
It's a long story.

25:21.521 --> 25:23.521
Yeah.

25:23.523 --> 25:26.223
You pretend to have a pet
to impress women.

25:26.225 --> 25:27.525
So it's a short story.

25:27.527 --> 25:28.993
I just don't get it.

25:28.995 --> 25:31.662
You don't need
to put on a show.

25:31.664 --> 25:36.267
You are very special agent
Anthony freakin' DiNozzo,

25:36.269 --> 25:38.035
and you are a catch.

25:38.037 --> 25:41.972
Maybe I just haven't
met the right one yet.

25:43.843 --> 25:47.778
Or maybe you're afraid
of who you're gonna find.

25:47.780 --> 25:49.280
Maybe.

25:49.282 --> 25:51.315
I'm sorry, this is a waste
of time, isn't it?

25:51.317 --> 25:54.318
I mean, it was over a month ago
when she was here.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.986
We're not gonna find any prints.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.588
Look how clean
i keep this place.

25:57.590 --> 25:59.557
Don't give up.

25:59.559 --> 26:01.825
I haven't even been
in the bedroom yet.

26:01.827 --> 26:03.661
We never made it to the bedroom.

26:03.663 --> 26:04.762
We stayed right out here.

26:04.764 --> 26:06.597
A little Sinatra,
a little chardonnay.

26:06.599 --> 26:09.066
God, she was good to go, too.

26:12.638 --> 26:13.637
Oh.

26:13.639 --> 26:16.307
Don't move.

26:16.309 --> 26:17.841
Tony?

26:17.843 --> 26:19.176
Ha-ha!

26:21.347 --> 26:22.980
I hate chardonnay.

26:22.982 --> 26:24.682
This has been sitting
untouched for a month.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.317
Do you know the last
person to touch it?

26:26.319 --> 26:29.019
Leah?
Leah.

26:32.692 --> 26:35.726
$50 for one
bottle of wine.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.962
Well, she said she was
a trust-fund baby,

26:37.964 --> 26:39.797
and so, you know,
a little nice chardonnay

26:39.799 --> 26:42.366
instead of a screw top.

26:42.368 --> 26:44.802
Hmm? You got her?

26:44.804 --> 26:46.904
Got her mug shot.

26:46.906 --> 26:48.372
Got two mug shots, okay.

26:48.374 --> 26:49.974
Elizabeth Elliot.

26:49.976 --> 26:52.076
Arrested twice in Florida

26:52.078 --> 26:54.345
for writing bad checks
and embezzlement.

26:54.347 --> 26:56.780
(Sighs)
Run her social.

26:59.118 --> 27:01.385
Okay, so she's
totally off the grid.

27:01.387 --> 27:02.886
Her driver's
license is expired.

27:02.888 --> 27:05.322
And she hasn't
filed her taxes since

27:05.324 --> 27:08.392
2009 when she was
a mortgage lender.

27:08.394 --> 27:11.729
Whatever she's doing now,
obviously doesn't hand out w2s.

27:11.731 --> 27:12.896
(Chuckles):
Mm-hmm!

27:12.898 --> 27:15.666
Two warrants out for her arrest.

27:15.668 --> 27:17.401
Means we're not the only
ones looking for her.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.937
But I'm gonna get
this little kitty cat.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.972
Oh, thank you.

27:24.410 --> 27:26.243
All right.

27:26.245 --> 27:27.845
I got it.
I narrowed down the list.

27:27.847 --> 27:29.179
I've got one name left.

27:29.181 --> 27:30.648
You ready for this?

27:30.650 --> 27:31.682
Drum roll.

27:31.684 --> 27:32.416
(Tapping on desk)

27:32.418 --> 27:35.152
The USS<i> Hannibal Hamlin.</i>

27:36.422 --> 27:38.422
I'm drawing a blank.

27:38.424 --> 27:39.690
Hannibal Hamlin.

27:41.227 --> 27:42.426
Come on, Hannibal Hamlin.

27:42.428 --> 27:44.028
Repeating his name isn't gonna

27:44.030 --> 27:45.396
make it magically happen, Tim.

27:45.398 --> 27:47.698
Okay, he was the second
most powerful guy

27:47.700 --> 27:49.933
in the United States for
a period of four years.

27:49.935 --> 27:52.903
Lincoln's vice president
during the civil war.

27:52.905 --> 27:54.405
Hannibal Hamlin.

27:54.407 --> 27:56.740
Secnav's never gonna
call a ship<i> the Hannibal,</i>

27:56.742 --> 27:58.075
unless it's christened
with fava beans

27:58.077 --> 27:59.910
and a bottle of chianti.

27:59.912 --> 28:01.879
You I.D.'D her.
That's great.

28:01.881 --> 28:02.880
Where you going?

28:02.882 --> 28:05.249
To find her and end this.

28:05.251 --> 28:07.084
Where is she?
I don't know.

28:07.086 --> 28:09.420
What are you gonna do, just
wander the streets aimlessly?

28:09.422 --> 28:11.889
Why don't you take your
lookalikes with you?

28:11.891 --> 28:14.825
How many dinozzos does it take
to screw in a lightbulb?

28:16.929 --> 28:18.462
Tell me you have something.

28:18.464 --> 28:20.431
Tony I.D.'D the woman
from his apartment.

28:20.433 --> 28:23.400
And McGee and I have a theory

28:23.402 --> 28:25.302
on who killed
our dead impersonator.

28:25.304 --> 28:27.037
Okay, go.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.439
Senator Shawn Kelly.

28:28.441 --> 28:31.208
I hope you have evidence.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.711
Circumstantial, but
it's overwhelming.

28:33.713 --> 28:34.945
All right,
walk me through it.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.280
Well, the
extortion e-mails

28:36.282 --> 28:38.115
that dead Tony sent
to senator Kelly

28:38.117 --> 28:41.118
refer to his quote,
"military secret."

28:41.120 --> 28:42.753
Kelly was an officer
in the Navy?

28:42.755 --> 28:43.954
A lieutenant.

28:43.956 --> 28:45.489
We did some digging and,

28:45.491 --> 28:48.058
in 1990, his ship
was sent to the Gulf

28:48.060 --> 28:49.760
to fight in operation
desert storm,

28:49.762 --> 28:52.463
but he didn't go
due to a medical discharge.

28:52.465 --> 28:53.464
So?

28:53.466 --> 28:55.733
So, five years ago,

28:55.735 --> 28:58.335
the doctor who authorized
that discharge recanted.

28:58.337 --> 29:00.738
Said Kelly paid him to lie,

29:00.740 --> 29:02.306
so he could stay
out of harm's way.

29:02.308 --> 29:04.225
McGee:
It's an election year, boss.

29:04.226 --> 29:06.143
Why would Kelly's opponents
not have used that against him?

29:06.145 --> 29:07.745
Navy records are sealed.

29:08.748 --> 29:10.848
But not to NCIS agents.

29:10.850 --> 29:13.751
Explains why this woman
wanted our Tony's identity.

29:13.753 --> 29:15.486
I mean, only someone
with access to classified

29:15.488 --> 29:17.855
military records
could get that information.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.823
Makes sense.
What else?

29:19.825 --> 29:21.792
Senator Kelly
takes a lot of limos,

29:21.794 --> 29:23.827
but when he drives
himself to work,

29:23.829 --> 29:26.497
he drives a 1972 white Mercedes.

29:26.499 --> 29:29.533
That arctic beach?

29:29.535 --> 29:31.034
Don't know, but...

29:31.036 --> 29:33.036
You see that?

29:33.038 --> 29:35.072
Parking decal to access

29:35.074 --> 29:36.774
congress's private parking lot.

29:36.776 --> 29:38.509
McGee: We think
the shred of vinyl

29:38.511 --> 29:40.511
that Abby found on
dead Tony's car isn't

29:40.513 --> 29:42.079
part of a bumper sticker,
but actually

29:42.081 --> 29:43.514
that parking decal.

29:43.516 --> 29:45.048
Bishop: To find out,
we need a warrant,

29:45.050 --> 29:46.784
but he's a sitting U.S. senator,

29:46.786 --> 29:48.819
so...
Get one.

30:06.972 --> 30:09.573
Good afternoon, officer.

30:09.575 --> 30:11.542
Sir!

30:11.544 --> 30:13.477
Back in the vehicle!
I understand.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.546
I'm a federal agent in
the course of an investigation.

30:15.548 --> 30:18.048
I'm reaching into my pocket;
I'm pulling out my badge.

30:18.050 --> 30:19.449
Here we go. Look at that.

30:19.451 --> 30:21.819
There's me. There's the badge.

30:23.289 --> 30:25.222
Where's your government vehicle?

30:25.224 --> 30:27.391
What... this is a rental car.

30:27.393 --> 30:28.892
I'm test-driving cars right now.

30:28.894 --> 30:30.160
I need that back.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.427
You were going
45 in a 35.

30:31.430 --> 30:32.930
When I ran your plates,
they flagged.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.932
Rental car company said
the credit card used

30:34.934 --> 30:36.567
to procure the
vehicle was stolen.

30:36.569 --> 30:39.503
Stolen<i> from</i> me, not by me.

30:39.505 --> 30:40.904
Uh-huh.

30:40.906 --> 30:42.005
What, you don't believe me?

30:42.007 --> 30:43.440
I believe you could
just as easily

30:43.442 --> 30:44.942
be the thief
in all this.

30:44.944 --> 30:47.845
You got beady little
rat eyes like one.

30:47.847 --> 30:49.246
(Grunts)

30:49.248 --> 30:51.481
You're under arrest for
impersonating a federal officer.

30:51.483 --> 30:52.916
Okay, all right. Listen.

30:52.918 --> 30:54.418
You're making a mistake.

30:54.420 --> 30:57.254
Bigger mistake was you playing
fake agent on my watch.

30:57.256 --> 30:59.323
Look, I...
Button it!

31:06.899 --> 31:08.298
Tony:
Thanks for getting me, Tim.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.300
Why do you smell so weird?

31:10.302 --> 31:13.437
I was seated between two guys
who stole a hot dog cart.

31:13.439 --> 31:16.340
Ah. Sauerkraut.

31:16.342 --> 31:18.642
Sorry. I'll keep
the windows open.

31:20.246 --> 31:22.880
So you all right?

31:22.882 --> 31:25.482
Feel like my life
is a charade.

31:25.484 --> 31:27.618
Uh, not any more
than usual.

31:27.620 --> 31:30.554
I mean, you'd tell me, right,
if I was losing my edge?

31:30.556 --> 31:33.023
The DiNozzo edge?

31:33.025 --> 31:34.625
'Cause I feel like it.

31:34.627 --> 31:36.627
I mean... (Laughs)

31:36.629 --> 31:39.296
I... I get swindled
by a bimbo.

31:39.298 --> 31:41.498
I got Laurel and Hardy
impersonating me.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.400
What about the third guy?
Is he a buffoon?

31:43.402 --> 31:45.102
Is that who I am?

31:45.104 --> 31:46.970
Tony, you're not
losing your edge.

31:46.972 --> 31:48.372
You've momentarily
misplaced it, okay?

31:48.374 --> 31:51.174
You're getting it back.

31:51.176 --> 31:54.444
Did a lot of thinking
in the big house.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.980
You weren't even booked.
You sat in the lobby.

31:56.982 --> 31:58.382
Time passed real slow.

31:59.985 --> 32:03.387
Honestly...

32:03.389 --> 32:05.422
Sometimes, I...

32:05.424 --> 32:07.491
Feel like I don't
know who I am.

32:07.493 --> 32:09.426
And it's strange,

32:09.428 --> 32:11.328
because she stole
my identity, right?

32:11.330 --> 32:14.698
But... I feel like I've
already lost my identity.

32:16.302 --> 32:18.335
I mean, what is this?

32:18.337 --> 32:21.271
Seriously, is this some
kind of weird metaphor

32:21.273 --> 32:23.340
for my current
psychological state?

32:23.342 --> 32:25.009
Look, I don't understand

32:25.010 --> 32:26.677
half of what you're talking
about right now, okay?

32:26.679 --> 32:30.147
And we don't have time
for an existential crisis.

32:30.149 --> 32:31.315
Listen to me.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.283
You are very special agent
Anthony DiNozzo.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.385
You survived
the pneumonic plague.

32:35.387 --> 32:37.688
You saved Gibbs
from drowning.

32:37.690 --> 32:40.390
But you know what?
More than anything...

32:40.392 --> 32:42.559
You're one of my best friends.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.965
All right, looks like
we tracked down the girl

32:47.967 --> 32:51.368
that got you into this mess,
so enough with the Oprah.

32:51.370 --> 32:53.070
Let's go get her.

32:53.072 --> 32:55.138
Thanks, Tim.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.408
Bishop:
<i>This is a receiver transponder.</i>

32:58.410 --> 33:00.677
You'll be able to both
hear and speak to us.

33:00.679 --> 33:02.346
All right, cool!

33:02.348 --> 33:04.214
Ooh! (Laughs)

33:04.216 --> 33:07.217
Whatever's happening here,
i don't like it.

33:07.219 --> 33:08.585
It's the only plan we got.

33:08.587 --> 33:10.220
Which is?

33:10.222 --> 33:11.989
Gibbs:
He's the bait.

33:11.991 --> 33:15.359
Woman running the extortion ring
texted him to arrange a meet.

33:15.361 --> 33:17.260
We see her, we grab her.

33:17.262 --> 33:19.429
Okay. All set.

33:19.431 --> 33:21.098
Ready, Freddie.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.100
McGee and DiNozzo?

33:23.102 --> 33:24.434
Meeting us there.

33:24.436 --> 33:26.486
Where are they?

33:26.487 --> 33:28.537
Uh, following up on a lead.
Didn't pan out.

33:30.009 --> 33:31.775
So, listen, stretch.

33:31.777 --> 33:33.510
This isn't a game.

33:33.512 --> 33:36.380
You got one shot at your friend.

33:36.382 --> 33:37.447
No fooling around.

33:37.449 --> 33:40.450
Don't worry. I'm an actor.

33:40.452 --> 33:43.687
Yeah. That's what
I'm worried about.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.794
(Birds chirping)

33:54.566 --> 33:56.466
Got anything?

33:56.468 --> 33:57.801
McGee:
Yeah, a blister.

33:57.803 --> 34:00.170
Thought gardening was
supposed to be therapeutic.

34:00.172 --> 34:02.072
Why does Tony get
to stay in the car?

34:02.074 --> 34:05.108
Tony:<i> Trust me, it's not</i>
<i> as fun as it sounds.</i>

34:05.110 --> 34:06.410
And I get to stay in the car

34:06.412 --> 34:08.278
because Leah,
or whatever her name is,

34:08.280 --> 34:09.413
knows what I look like.

34:09.415 --> 34:10.580
Remember?

34:14.720 --> 34:16.586
Hey.

34:16.588 --> 34:17.821
What's he doing?

34:17.823 --> 34:19.056
Bishop:
Uh...

34:19.058 --> 34:20.490
I guess he's hot?

34:20.492 --> 34:21.591
Sign of nerves?

34:21.593 --> 34:23.493
Ya think?

34:23.495 --> 34:24.795
(Exhales)

34:27.433 --> 34:29.533
Okay.

34:29.535 --> 34:30.767
What the hell?
Bishop...

34:30.769 --> 34:32.302
On it.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.674
Hey. Hey.

34:37.676 --> 34:38.842
I don't want to do this.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.343
Okay.
Get ahold of yourself.
Okay?

34:40.345 --> 34:41.962
She's gonna be
here any minute.

34:41.963 --> 34:43.580
What? Okay. I can't, I can't,
i can't do this.

34:43.582 --> 34:45.148
Oh, boy.
Gibbs: Abort. Abort.

34:45.150 --> 34:46.450
Now. Get him out of there.

34:46.452 --> 34:47.784
Okay. Okay.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.519
Oh, there, that's good.

34:49.521 --> 34:50.587
All right.

34:50.589 --> 34:53.557
And the other...
Okay.

35:17.649 --> 35:19.549
So much for
<i> strangers in the night.</i>

35:19.551 --> 35:21.485
Tony.

35:21.487 --> 35:22.519
The one and only.

35:22.521 --> 35:24.621
You said you were a cat person.

35:24.623 --> 35:27.491
Yeah, well...
I said a lot of things.

35:29.228 --> 35:30.760
You know,
you're looking good, Tony.

35:30.762 --> 35:32.295
(Laughs)

35:32.297 --> 35:33.563
So are you.

35:33.565 --> 35:34.898
But it pains me to say,

35:34.900 --> 35:36.800
Leah Ramsey
or Elizabeth Elliott,

35:36.802 --> 35:39.603
you're under arrest.

35:39.605 --> 35:41.771
And, you know, I imagined
putting these on you;

35:41.773 --> 35:43.673
it was just under
different circumstances.

35:55.621 --> 35:58.255
Writing your confession?

35:58.257 --> 35:59.890
Mm.

35:59.892 --> 36:01.725
My...

36:01.727 --> 36:04.261
"Get out of jail free" card.

36:04.263 --> 36:05.629
Read it.

36:05.631 --> 36:08.598
It's the story of how
my friend Scott byers

36:08.600 --> 36:13.637
was run off the road and
killed by senator Shawn Kelly.

36:13.639 --> 36:14.671
So what?

36:14.673 --> 36:16.339
So go arrest him for murder.

36:16.341 --> 36:17.607
Based on your word?

36:17.609 --> 36:18.808
He's a United States senator.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.510
You're a scam artist.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.746
(Chuckles)

36:22.748 --> 36:24.948
Check my phone records.

36:24.950 --> 36:27.284
Scott called me that night,
freaking out.

36:27.286 --> 36:30.554
Said the senator was following
him, driving like crazy.

36:30.556 --> 36:33.623
Then I heard screaming,
and the phone went dead.

36:35.294 --> 36:37.727
So what do you say?
My testimony for my immunity?

36:37.729 --> 36:39.896
We don't make deals.

36:41.733 --> 36:43.533
Fine.

36:43.535 --> 36:46.570
Arrest me for extortion...

36:46.572 --> 36:48.838
But let a killer go free.

36:51.677 --> 36:53.610
It's just a matter of leverage.

36:53.612 --> 36:55.912
I learned that negotiating
mortgage loans.

36:55.914 --> 36:57.881
Where you going?

36:57.883 --> 37:00.383
I'd be worried about
where you were going.

37:05.624 --> 37:06.756
Abby test the senator's car?

37:06.758 --> 37:07.958
Arctic beach white.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.426
And the parking decal?

37:09.428 --> 37:10.594
McGee: The car was
recently repaired.

37:10.596 --> 37:12.462
New Fender, new
parking decal.

37:12.464 --> 37:14.297
So there's no way
to definitively say

37:14.299 --> 37:17.434
if it was his car that ran
dead Tony off the road.

37:17.436 --> 37:19.703
We may need her testimony
to convict him.

37:19.705 --> 37:21.738
We are not
letting her walk, McGee.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.608
We are
absolutely sure

37:24.610 --> 37:25.875
that senator Kelly did this?

37:25.877 --> 37:27.510
I don't trust a word she says.

37:27.512 --> 37:28.778
Bishop:
How did she learn about

37:28.780 --> 37:29.913
the senator
military secret?

37:29.915 --> 37:31.648
Journalists,
political rivals--

37:31.650 --> 37:35.785
nobody could dig this up,
but some hustler figured it out?

37:35.787 --> 37:37.854
Doesn't make any sense.

37:41.260 --> 37:42.726
She had somebody on the inside.

37:42.728 --> 37:45.395
Someone who knew the senator
better than anyone?

37:45.397 --> 37:47.330
DiNozzo, come on.
You're with me.

37:47.332 --> 37:48.698
With pleasure, sir.

37:52.738 --> 37:54.571
NCIS!

37:55.774 --> 37:57.274
Gentlemen.

37:57.276 --> 37:58.708
Senator Kelly's
on the hill.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.644
Can I take a message for him?

38:00.646 --> 38:01.878
Tony:
Sure.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.446
We got a message.

38:03.448 --> 38:05.048
Tell him he's gonna
need a new assistant.

38:09.855 --> 38:12.889
Tall Tony (Mouth full):
<i> Mm. So senator Kelly</i>

38:12.891 --> 38:14.691
did not kill dead Tony?

38:14.693 --> 38:16.826
No.

38:16.828 --> 38:19.796
The senator's aide, Lisa,
was driving the car.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.500
The chick who hired us.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.770
No, that was Elizabeth,

38:26.772 --> 38:28.638
who I knew as Leah,

38:28.640 --> 38:30.073
and she's the one
who stole my identity

38:30.075 --> 38:32.642
and gave it to you clowns.
No offense.

38:32.644 --> 38:33.843
None taken.

38:33.845 --> 38:35.812
Why did Lisa
run him off the road?

38:35.814 --> 38:37.981
Because dead Tony
was about to squeal

38:37.983 --> 38:39.816
and ruin their
extortion operation.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.484
Would you... would you
pay attention?

38:41.486 --> 38:42.786
Focus.

38:44.690 --> 38:46.790
They were partners?
Mm.

38:47.859 --> 38:49.693
They worked at
the same mortgage company.

38:49.695 --> 38:51.094
Tall Tony:
She's cute.

38:51.096 --> 38:52.095
Yeah, total hottie.

38:52.097 --> 38:53.830
2008,
when the bubble burst,

38:53.832 --> 38:56.399
Lisa went to work
as a senator's aide,

38:56.401 --> 38:57.834
and Elizabeth became a grifter.

38:57.836 --> 39:01.771
So Lisa concocted a plan
to blackmail her boss.

39:01.773 --> 39:03.890
Mm.

39:03.891 --> 39:06.008
Yeah, and it was so successful,
they expanded operations.

39:06.011 --> 39:09.012
Which is why they needed
more phony Tonys.

39:09.014 --> 39:11.915
Us. (Laughs)

39:13.552 --> 39:15.018
Do-do you get it?
Do... do you see?

39:15.020 --> 39:17.721
Are those hot peppers?
Oh, my god.

39:17.723 --> 39:19.273
(Tall Tony laughs)

39:19.274 --> 39:20.824
How did you know
they were my favorite, huh?

39:20.826 --> 39:22.492
Because they're my favorite.

39:22.494 --> 39:24.127
Ah!

39:24.129 --> 39:25.628
(Laughter)

39:25.630 --> 39:26.629
(Sighs)

39:26.631 --> 39:28.431
So, uh, what happens to us?

39:28.433 --> 39:30.066
We'll put a good word
in for you,

39:30.068 --> 39:32.469
but sorry, guys,
you're gonna have to do time.

39:33.405 --> 39:34.804
Brief, with good behavior.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.477
Oh, my god.

39:40.479 --> 39:41.878
No way.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.013
No way!

39:44.015 --> 39:45.515
Gibbs:
Bishop?

39:45.517 --> 39:47.016
Sorry.

39:47.018 --> 39:49.152
Uh, it's nothing. It's fine.

39:50.122 --> 39:51.855
Oh, my god.

39:51.857 --> 39:53.623
No way.

39:53.625 --> 39:54.924
What? What is it?

39:54.926 --> 39:56.926
It's the ship-naming contest.

39:56.928 --> 39:58.762
I'm a finalist.

39:58.764 --> 40:00.247
The contest just ended.

40:00.248 --> 40:01.731
How-how could they have made
their decision already?

40:01.733 --> 40:03.967
I don't know, but they
narrowed it down to ten.

40:05.737 --> 40:06.703
I'm jealous.

40:07.839 --> 40:09.389
Happy for you though.

40:09.390 --> 40:10.940
Congratulations.
What'd you go with?

40:10.942 --> 40:12.809
Yeah, I want to see this.

40:12.811 --> 40:15.078
A deceased,
decorated war veteran.

40:15.080 --> 40:18.782
USS<i> admiral John McGee.</i>

40:18.784 --> 40:20.450
My dad.

40:21.586 --> 40:23.153
Thanks, Ellie.

40:23.155 --> 40:24.888
You bet, Tim.
