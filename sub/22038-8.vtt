00:26.270 --> 00:27.640
So far in this series,

00:27.640 --> 00:30.600
we've focused
on the country music outlaws,

00:30.600 --> 00:32.430
artists who refuse to follow

00:32.430 --> 00:34.220
the rules of the record business

00:34.220 --> 00:38.020
or the rules
of polite society,
for that matter.

00:38.020 --> 00:39.600
These have all been
pretty big names,

00:39.600 --> 00:41.060
but we're gonna end this season

00:41.060 --> 00:43.600
with a guy who was every bit
the outlaw artist

00:43.600 --> 00:44.810
in his own way,

00:44.810 --> 00:48.100
but who never quite achieved
that same level of fame.

00:48.100 --> 00:50.060
And to be honest,
it just seems wrong

00:50.060 --> 00:52.310
that hardly anybody
knows his name.

Mike:
Willie Nelson recorded
one of his songs

01:35.640 --> 01:37.770
alongside Merle Haggard.

01:37.770 --> 01:40.180
In fact, Merle called it
the best country song

01:40.180 --> 01:42.270
he'd heard in 15 years.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.980
Lucinda Williams wrote
a song about the guy,

01:44.980 --> 01:47.470
and Townes Van Zandt
called him a brother.

01:47.470 --> 01:50.930
Remember this name: Blaze Foley.

01:50.930 --> 01:53.390
(theme music playing)

02:05.350 --> 02:07.890
He was the nicest asshole
you'd ever meet.

02:07.890 --> 02:09.520
And that's something,
with his looks,

02:09.520 --> 02:10.980
you'd never guess.

02:10.980 --> 02:12.680
He was a very
scary-looking guy.

02:12.680 --> 02:14.020
Scary-looking guy, yeah.

02:14.020 --> 02:16.770
Mike:
Hank Sinatra and Chuck Lamb

02:16.770 --> 02:18.560
witnessed the magic
of Blaze Foley

02:18.560 --> 02:21.060
more times than either
of them can count.

02:21.060 --> 02:25.220
They remember Blaze
as an intimidating presence
on first impression.

02:25.220 --> 02:26.890
Hank:
Blaze walked with a big limp,

02:26.890 --> 02:30.220
and that even made him
more scary, more pirate-like,
you know.

02:30.220 --> 02:31.930
He even scared
some of the bikers.

02:31.930 --> 02:33.600
He was just a big 'ol goon.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.140
And when he started singing,

02:35.140 --> 02:38.140
you just completely lost
all thoughts of...

02:38.140 --> 02:40.890
what you thought
when you first saw the guy.

02:40.890 --> 02:43.560

02:53.180 --> 02:54.770
Blaze had a bet
with somebody,

02:54.770 --> 02:56.270
a hundred dollar bet
with somebody

02:56.270 --> 02:58.430
that he could get
kicked out of every bar

02:58.430 --> 03:00.220
that had
live music in Austin.

03:00.220 --> 03:03.520
Yeah, he literally
got thrown out of every
bar in town.

03:03.520 --> 03:06.310
The Outhouse
was the last place.
(laughs)

03:06.310 --> 03:09.430
I was not gonna help
Blaze win that bet.

03:09.430 --> 03:12.100
So we managed
to put up with him.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.430
Met this character,
Blaze Foley,

03:14.430 --> 03:16.430
back in 1977,

03:16.430 --> 03:18.770
and, uh, he had this guitar
in this case

03:18.770 --> 03:20.390
that he wanted to show me.

03:20.390 --> 03:22.220
Actually, he wanted
to sell it to me.

03:22.220 --> 03:24.980
Mike:
Singer-songwriter Gurf Morlix,

03:24.980 --> 03:27.890
maybe the greatest name
in country music history,

03:27.890 --> 03:29.890
was playing a gig
when Blaze Foley

03:29.890 --> 03:31.890
approached him
with a proposition.

03:31.890 --> 03:33.640
I was in the middle of a set,

03:33.640 --> 03:36.810
and he came up to me
and wanted to talk to me,

03:36.810 --> 03:38.640
like, in between songs.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.770
And he's, like, six-three,
six-four maybe,

03:40.770 --> 03:43.270
long hair, cowboy hat,

03:43.270 --> 03:44.980
just looked like a weirdo.

03:44.980 --> 03:46.060
And I said, well, you know,

03:46.060 --> 03:48.310
"When I take a break,
can we talk then?"

03:48.310 --> 03:51.520
And a little later on,
he showed me this guitar
that he wanted to sell me.

03:51.520 --> 03:54.930
It was an old acoustic guitar
from the early 1900s,

03:54.930 --> 03:58.140
and, uh, I found out later
it wasn't his guitar.

03:58.140 --> 04:00.470
He always had to borrow
somebody's guitar

04:00.470 --> 04:02.430
to play
most of the time.

04:02.430 --> 04:05.180
Yeah, I don't know
if he ever actually
owned one.

04:05.180 --> 04:08.140
I guess he sold that guitar
to about four different people.

04:08.140 --> 04:10.600
(laughs)
And none of 'em ever got it.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.060
Mike:
A few days later,

04:12.060 --> 04:14.680
Blaze played his first-ever
performance in Austin,

04:14.680 --> 04:17.270
the city where he would
build his legend.

04:17.270 --> 04:20.640
He got a gig in a...
it was in a disco,

04:20.640 --> 04:24.020
just a ridiculous place
for him to be,

04:24.020 --> 04:26.930
and we kind of sat around,
and he had a valise

04:26.930 --> 04:28.520
with a bunch of stuff in it,

04:28.520 --> 04:30.270
and he would pull out pictures

04:30.270 --> 04:32.140
and say,
"Well, here's the person
from this song,"

04:32.140 --> 04:35.470
and he'd play the song
while the picture was being
passed around.

04:35.470 --> 04:37.020
Mike:
One of the pictures
he pulled out

04:37.020 --> 04:39.270
was of himself as a kid,

04:39.270 --> 04:41.770
for a little number
he called, "Fat Boy."

04:41.770 --> 04:44.560
♪ I won't be
a fat boy anymore... ♪

04:44.560 --> 04:47.020
Lindsey Horton:
He used to tell me about
when he'd be at home as a kid

04:47.020 --> 04:49.470
that he'd sit down
and eat a stick of butter.

04:49.470 --> 04:51.140
He'd just sit down for a snack

04:51.140 --> 04:52.730
and he'd just eat
a stick of butter.

04:52.730 --> 04:54.020
And of course,
you do things like that,

04:54.020 --> 04:56.140
it's gonna pack
some weight on you.

04:56.140 --> 04:57.390
I first met Blaze

04:57.390 --> 04:58.730
when I was working
the Sears store,

04:58.730 --> 04:59.850
when I was in high school.

04:59.850 --> 05:02.060
Mike:
Lindsey Horton
was in automotive.

05:02.060 --> 05:05.310
Blaze, or Michael Fuller,
as he was known then,

05:05.310 --> 05:07.140
worked in paint and hardware.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.270
He was a big kid
from Malvern, Arkansas,

05:10.270 --> 05:12.310
who had a thing
about his weight

05:12.310 --> 05:14.220
and his name, apparently.

05:14.220 --> 05:16.600
He started introducing
himself on stage

05:16.600 --> 05:18.930
as Deputy Dawg,
like the cartoon.

05:18.930 --> 05:21.430
Deputy Dawg, of course,
was destitute,

05:21.430 --> 05:24.520
so I went with him
a few places around
trying to sell the guitar.

05:24.520 --> 05:27.100
Someone said, well, you know,
Kinky Friedman buys guitars.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.640
He might be
interested in that.

05:28.640 --> 05:31.100
Kinky was playing down
at the Armadillo World
Headquarters,

05:31.100 --> 05:34.220
so, uh, we sent word in
that we'd like to talk to him,

05:34.220 --> 05:36.850
and sure enough,
he came out and sat down
with us.

05:36.850 --> 05:39.100
And Blaze
showed him his guitar,
and Kinky played it a while,

05:39.100 --> 05:42.100
played a few little,
little runs of this and that
and whatever on it.

05:42.100 --> 05:43.600
And, uh, said,

05:43.600 --> 05:45.730
"Well, thank you very much
for showing me your guitar."

05:45.730 --> 05:46.980
And got up
and went back inside.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.060
I don't remember precisely
meeting anybody.

05:49.060 --> 05:51.730
I'm sure it was on the gangplank
of Noah's Ark, you know,

05:51.730 --> 05:54.270
but, uh, you'd have to tell me

05:54.270 --> 05:56.600
and then it comes back
to the Kinkster.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.390
There was one night
when we went to a,

05:59.390 --> 06:01.810
a Willie Nelson concert,

06:01.810 --> 06:03.270
and somehow we ended up

06:03.270 --> 06:06.140
right in front of the stage
with this guitar.

06:06.140 --> 06:09.100
At some point,
Willie Nelson, you know,
sort of leaned down

06:09.100 --> 06:10.430
and Deputy said to him,

06:10.430 --> 06:13.730
"Would you like to buy
this guitar?" you know.

06:13.730 --> 06:15.060
Nobody would buy it.

06:15.060 --> 06:17.020
Mike:
In 1974,

06:17.020 --> 06:18.640
Michael met Sybil Rosen

06:18.640 --> 06:21.060
while performing
at an artists' commune

06:21.060 --> 06:23.470
45 miles west of Atlanta.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.140
It was during that time

06:25.140 --> 06:26.980
that he was working
on the name,

06:26.980 --> 06:28.220
Blaze Foley.

06:28.220 --> 06:31.180
It was just like, you know,
watching someone being born.

06:31.180 --> 06:33.770
Mike:
He called himself
the illegitimate son

06:33.770 --> 06:35.020
of Red Foley,

06:35.020 --> 06:37.600
a country music legend
who was an inveterate drunk,

06:37.600 --> 06:40.600
and Blaze Starr,
a stripper whose specialty

06:40.600 --> 06:42.890
was a stage effect
that produced smoke

06:42.890 --> 06:44.470
from between her legs.

06:44.470 --> 06:45.850
We was in love.

06:45.850 --> 06:49.020
At some point, I thought
that it was probably time

06:49.020 --> 06:51.470
to introduce him to the folks.

06:51.470 --> 06:53.140
Here's my middle-aged,

06:53.140 --> 06:55.810
middle-class Jewish parents
from Brooklyn.

06:55.810 --> 06:59.270
You know, they sweated blood
to send me to college.

06:59.270 --> 07:02.390
And I come in
with this big cowboy

07:02.390 --> 07:04.310
with boots and a hat,

07:04.310 --> 07:06.180
this big handlebar mustache,

07:06.180 --> 07:09.020
and he has my IUD
in his ear.

07:09.020 --> 07:10.470
(laughs)

07:10.470 --> 07:12.890
I'd gone to, you know,
Planned Parenthood
and asked for an IUD,

07:12.890 --> 07:15.640
and my body
couldn't tolerate it,
so they removed it

07:15.640 --> 07:18.850
and they gave it to Blaze,
and he put it in his ear,
you know.

07:18.850 --> 07:21.060
And my mother, God bless her,

07:21.060 --> 07:23.060
she takes one look at Blaze,

07:23.060 --> 07:25.470
turns around,
goes into the bedroom,

07:25.470 --> 07:26.770
starts crying.

07:26.770 --> 07:28.350
(laughing)

07:28.350 --> 07:30.930
But Blaze starts singing
these songs,

07:30.930 --> 07:34.100
and, um, once he sang,

07:34.100 --> 07:35.980
they really
couldn't resist him.

07:35.980 --> 07:40.430
♪ With sad,
pretty blue eyes... ♪

07:42.520 --> 07:45.810
Mike:
Blaze was with Sybil
when he first visited Austin,

07:45.810 --> 07:48.060
home of sorts
to another singer-songwriter,

07:48.060 --> 07:51.220
a hard-living crooner
who would become a legend,

07:51.220 --> 07:52.980
Townes Van Zandt.

07:52.980 --> 07:54.810
Blaze was a homeless person,
I think,

07:54.810 --> 07:56.270
you know, intentionally.

07:56.270 --> 07:57.600
I always got the impression,

07:57.600 --> 08:00.060
he just slept on people's
couches all the time, you know?

08:00.060 --> 08:02.060
And that must have been
a horrible feeling.

08:02.060 --> 08:03.850
But he seemed to be
comfortable with it.

08:03.850 --> 08:07.730
Mike:
Harold Eggers spent 20 years
booking Townes Van Zandt

08:07.730 --> 08:09.390
and trying to stay sane.

08:09.390 --> 08:12.730
He tried several times
to get a record deal for Blaze.

08:12.730 --> 08:14.560
They were gonna put him
on the road with Townes

08:14.560 --> 08:16.310
when Heartland Records,
we made the record deal,

08:16.310 --> 08:19.520
they had said well, you know,
"Can you keep a lid on him?"

08:19.520 --> 08:21.600
And you know, I always
say yes to everything.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.770
It's like, "Sure, man,
we can keep a lid on Townes
and the two of 'em," you know.

08:24.770 --> 08:28.770
But to be honest with you,
there's no lid for those guys.
It was... They were full tilt.

08:28.770 --> 08:30.770
Mike:
If the two of them
weren't bad enough,

08:30.770 --> 08:32.890
they used to run around
with this guy.

08:32.890 --> 08:35.430
I used to manufacture
methamphetamine.

08:35.430 --> 08:37.140
I used to be
a pretty good chemist.

08:37.140 --> 08:39.060
The reason I learned
to make methamphetamine--

08:39.060 --> 08:41.220
because I liked it
more than anybody else.

08:41.220 --> 08:44.100
Mike:
Leland Waddell claims
that his side business

08:44.100 --> 08:46.930
kept him in skins and sticks
as a drummer.

08:46.930 --> 08:49.390
I met this guy,
he turned me on to it.

08:49.390 --> 08:52.430
I said, "Damn.
Where'd you get that?
That's good."

08:52.430 --> 08:54.100
He said, "Oh, I made it."

08:54.100 --> 08:55.680
"You what?

08:55.680 --> 08:57.140
You made it!"

08:57.140 --> 09:00.640
You know, and I didn't let
that motherfucker leave my sight

09:00.640 --> 09:03.520
until I learned
how to do it.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.770
You know, I mean,
I said goddamn,

09:05.770 --> 09:07.390
this is the best thing--

09:07.390 --> 09:09.220
I said, this is
the best thing of all.

09:09.220 --> 09:12.310
It's like goddamn,
why do I have to worry
about money?

09:12.310 --> 09:15.390
I can actually make
fucking speed.

09:15.390 --> 09:18.060

That was Waddell in 2002.

09:18.060 --> 09:19.640
This is him now.

09:19.640 --> 09:20.810
He survived,

09:20.810 --> 09:21.980
mostly intact.

09:21.980 --> 09:23.640
Blaze was staying with Townes.

09:23.640 --> 09:26.600
Townes lived like four blocks
from me at the time.

09:26.600 --> 09:30.140
And so, um, Townes called me,
he said, "Come on over,
Blaze is here, man.

09:30.140 --> 09:33.140
We got some Kamchatka Vodka,
come on over, man."

09:33.140 --> 09:35.980
Kamchatka
is the cheapest vodka
that you can buy.

09:35.980 --> 09:39.060
It's like a dollar and 60 cents
for a half-pint.

09:39.060 --> 09:42.020
So I went
over there to Townes',

09:42.020 --> 09:45.270
and the minute I showed up,
Jeanene, who's Townes' wife,

09:45.270 --> 09:48.180
you know, she knew
what was about to happen.

09:48.180 --> 09:49.730
Pretty much at that time,

09:49.730 --> 09:51.470
they were pretty much
best friends,

09:51.470 --> 09:52.850
running buddies.

09:52.850 --> 09:54.850
So Townes says, "Hey, man,

09:54.850 --> 09:56.600
"I'm gonna die pretty soon.

09:56.600 --> 10:01.020
"I want you and Blaze
to go out and help me
find a gravesite.

10:01.020 --> 10:04.350
Let's go today, because I know
I'm gonna die any minute."

10:04.350 --> 10:07.350
So I said, "Sure, man,
let's go take a look."

10:07.350 --> 10:10.100
Well, we went
to Texas Cemetery,

10:10.100 --> 10:11.680
where all the senators and...

10:11.680 --> 10:13.810
and all of those were buried,

10:13.810 --> 10:15.520
and way too hifalutin.

10:15.520 --> 10:19.470
Stopped by the liquor store,
got us a half a pint each
or whatever,

10:19.470 --> 10:22.930
spent another 30-45 minutes
looking around.

10:22.930 --> 10:25.770
We were right over here
off the interstate.

10:25.770 --> 10:27.890
Blaze looked over, he said,

10:27.890 --> 10:30.060
"Man, there's a cemetery
right there."

10:30.060 --> 10:31.810
So we said, "All right,
let's go take a look."

10:31.810 --> 10:34.270
Well, Blaze stumbled out,

10:34.270 --> 10:36.220
sat down on a gravestone.

10:36.220 --> 10:39.270
Townes couldn't walk,
so Blaze grabbed his feet

10:39.270 --> 10:41.100
and I grabbed his arms,

10:41.100 --> 10:43.560
and we drug him through
that cemetery.

10:43.560 --> 10:47.020
And every time we'd get
to one of them old crosses,
you know,

10:47.020 --> 10:49.310
"Damn, man,
what do you think
about this, man?"

10:49.310 --> 10:52.390
"Ah, yeah, man,
I like that, but let's look."

10:52.390 --> 10:55.560
So we went to the back
of the cemetery,

10:55.560 --> 10:57.350
and as we went over that hill,

10:57.350 --> 10:59.270
there was an encampment
of homeless people

10:59.270 --> 11:02.100
right at the edge
of the cemetery.

11:02.100 --> 11:04.560
As we drug him
across there, man,

11:04.560 --> 11:08.020
they was headed out of there.
They thought he was dead.

11:08.020 --> 11:10.770
So finally, "We found you
the one we like."

11:10.770 --> 11:12.730
"Um, this is--
What do you think about this?"

11:12.730 --> 11:15.850
Well, that-- by that time,
he was totally out,

11:15.850 --> 11:18.270
so I told Blaze, I said,
"Well, let's go back,

11:18.270 --> 11:20.640
get in the car
and go get some more booze,

11:20.640 --> 11:22.310
and we'll come back
and get him."

11:22.310 --> 11:26.730
So we left him leaned up
against that headstone
in that cemetery,

11:26.730 --> 11:28.220
passed completely out.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.520
He looked as dead
as anybody you ever seen.

11:30.520 --> 11:32.430
Blaze says, "Hey, man,

11:32.430 --> 11:34.560
I think we did all right,
don't you?"

11:34.560 --> 11:37.310
Mike:
Townes went on to live...

11:37.310 --> 11:39.520
another 16 years.

11:39.520 --> 11:42.180
The first time I remember
actually seeing him

11:42.180 --> 11:43.810
or knowing who he was,

11:43.810 --> 11:45.980
he was asleep under
the pool table

11:45.980 --> 11:48.930
at a singer-songwriter bar
here in Austin.

11:48.930 --> 11:53.020
Mike:
Larry Monroe was a local DJ
who frequented the Outhouse

11:53.020 --> 11:54.890
and became friendly with Blaze.

11:54.890 --> 11:57.680
I remember
he had Mercurochrome
on his face,

11:57.680 --> 12:00.560
you know, just--
he had painted his face
with it.

12:00.560 --> 12:03.680
And he was sprawled out
on his back,

12:03.680 --> 12:05.100
people just playing pool,

12:05.100 --> 12:07.520
and every time somebody
would make a ball

12:07.520 --> 12:11.060
and it would drop down
and then roll across,

12:11.060 --> 12:13.180
it would wake Blaze up
just momentarily.

12:13.180 --> 12:14.810
And he'd kind of rouse up

12:14.810 --> 12:17.930
and hit his head
on the underside
of the pool table,

12:17.930 --> 12:19.810
and then he'd just
sprawl back out

12:19.810 --> 12:21.390
and go back to sleep.

12:21.390 --> 12:25.640
When I met Townes,
I was just kind of thrown into
Townes' world overnight,

12:25.640 --> 12:29.350
and one of the first things
we did was go find Blaze.

12:29.350 --> 12:31.930
And he was sleeping
under that pool table.

12:31.930 --> 12:36.350
It was early in the morning,
Blaze comes crawling out,
you know, "Good morning,"

12:36.350 --> 12:38.600
and, you know,
"Who's this little darling?"

12:38.600 --> 12:40.350
And actually,
I was quite frightened.

12:40.350 --> 12:42.850
You know? I'm like,
"What in the hell?"

12:42.850 --> 12:46.310
Mike:
Blaze also had another
kind of bizarre habit:

12:46.310 --> 12:47.520
duct tape.

12:47.520 --> 12:50.100
He used a lot of duct tape.
Duct tape...

12:50.100 --> 12:53.680
He had some outfits
with duct tape lapels...
Yeah.

12:53.680 --> 12:58.770
This craze developed around
the movie Urban Cowboy.

12:58.770 --> 13:00.810
All of the sudden,
people are showing up,

13:00.810 --> 13:03.600
wearing expensive
country and western jewelry,

13:03.600 --> 13:07.180
and accouterments,
as Blaze would call 'em--

13:07.180 --> 13:10.180
silver collar tips,
and silver boot tips,

13:10.180 --> 13:12.180
and they were going
to these bars

13:12.180 --> 13:14.140
and spending all this money
on this stuff.

13:14.140 --> 13:17.060
And Blaze,
he would talk about
how ridiculous it was

13:17.060 --> 13:18.680
that these people
were spending

13:18.680 --> 13:21.060
hundreds and hundreds
of dollars on...

13:21.060 --> 13:22.730
on these pieces of silver,

13:22.730 --> 13:24.560
when duct tape
was almost as good.

13:24.560 --> 13:28.060
So he started duct taping
his collar tips and his
boot tips,

13:28.060 --> 13:30.470
and then it kind of--
it took off from there.

13:30.470 --> 13:33.220
He started making clothes
out of duct tape.

13:33.220 --> 13:36.980
He made shoes out of duct tape,
made a set of cowboy boots.

13:36.980 --> 13:39.020
Nobody questioned it.

13:39.020 --> 13:41.560
I mean, I never asked him
about the duct tape.

13:41.560 --> 13:43.890
Maybe that duct tape
was the only thing
holding him together.

13:43.890 --> 13:45.180
(laughs)

13:45.180 --> 13:47.060
Mike:
At some point,
he stopped living

13:47.060 --> 13:49.600
under pool tables
and other people's couches

13:49.600 --> 13:51.930
and moved into an actual car.

13:51.930 --> 13:53.430
It was a wood panel,

13:53.430 --> 13:56.930
avocado green
Esquire station wagon.

13:56.930 --> 13:59.930
And, um, I remember one time
my car had broken down,

13:59.930 --> 14:03.430
so he, like, generously said,
"Oh, you can use my car."

14:03.430 --> 14:05.930
So, Townes and I
and some other girl

14:05.930 --> 14:07.430
were out partying all night,

14:07.430 --> 14:10.770
and we were, like,
talking and stuff,
and I look up

14:10.770 --> 14:13.390
and there's another
exact car,

14:13.390 --> 14:16.930
avocado green, wood panel,
Esquire station wagon

14:16.930 --> 14:19.100
on the other side of the road
and it jumped the median

14:19.100 --> 14:22.470
right when I looked up.
It was like, boom!

14:22.470 --> 14:23.930
Pretty bad wreck.

14:23.930 --> 14:26.890
And we couldn't figure out
which car was whose afterwards.

14:26.890 --> 14:28.680
But then,
one of the first people

14:28.680 --> 14:31.100
on the street
after the wreck is Blaze.

14:31.100 --> 14:32.430
And I'm standing
in the median,

14:32.430 --> 14:34.350
crying,
"I'm a home-wrecker!"

14:34.350 --> 14:36.310
'Cause he lived in the car.

14:36.310 --> 14:38.810
"I'm a home-wrecker!
I wrecked your home!"

14:38.810 --> 14:41.020
And so we gave him
a key to the house

14:41.020 --> 14:44.470
and gave him permanent
couch privileges.

14:44.470 --> 14:46.810
Mike:
By 1978, Townes Van Zandt

14:46.810 --> 14:49.430
was working on his seventh
studio album.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.730
Blaze couldn't get arrested.

14:51.730 --> 14:54.100
Well, in the figurative
sense, at least.

14:54.100 --> 14:55.890
Harold Eggers
had been trying

14:55.890 --> 14:58.390
to get Blaze
to do an album,

14:58.390 --> 15:01.180
and Blaze was...

15:01.180 --> 15:04.310
not happy
about contracts.

15:04.310 --> 15:06.180
So him and Harold
had gone around

15:06.180 --> 15:07.680
and around and around

15:07.680 --> 15:11.310
about selling his soul
to the devil, you know.

15:11.310 --> 15:14.890
Yeah, I would say,
"Now, look. If Townes
is willing to sign it,

15:14.890 --> 15:17.680
come on, you can't be
that paranoid," I said,
you know.

15:17.680 --> 15:19.980
Then finally he signed it,
and threw it on the floor,
and said,

15:19.980 --> 15:23.520
"There it is, man!
Now you own me
like everybody else."

15:23.520 --> 15:25.020
So Harold, one night says,

15:25.020 --> 15:28.520
"Okay, I want to do a video
on the front porch with Blaze."

15:28.520 --> 15:30.890
I was like, "You bet, man,
no problem."

15:30.890 --> 15:34.680
So here they came,
and I started videotaping.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.810
Well, Blaze is shit-faced,
totally smashed.

15:37.810 --> 15:39.600
And he's got that
album cover

15:39.600 --> 15:41.730
sitting here beside him
on the chair,

15:41.730 --> 15:44.470
and Harold says,
"Well, hold up the album
and talk about it, you know."

15:44.470 --> 15:47.810
And, "You got to straighten up.
Come on, this is serious,
you know."

15:47.810 --> 15:51.350
Blaze just reaches down there
and picks up that album cover,

15:51.350 --> 15:55.390
"Screw your album.
Screw your contract.
Screw you."

15:55.390 --> 15:57.770
And-- Poom!
Like a Frisbee.

15:57.770 --> 16:01.140
Knocked his hat off.
It was that close-- Schoomp!

16:01.140 --> 16:03.930
I told him, I said, "Blaze,
you do that one more time,
I'm gonna kill you."

16:03.930 --> 16:05.850
And he laughed, you know,
and, uh...

16:05.850 --> 16:07.890
Well, he could've been
a Vaudeville character,
you know.

16:07.890 --> 16:10.520
Mike:
At the height
of Houston's oil boom,

16:10.520 --> 16:13.560
Gurf Morlix remembers
that Blaze found some
money guys

16:13.560 --> 16:15.850
to back his first real
studio session.

16:15.850 --> 16:19.220
It was an oil trading company
named Zephyr Records,

16:19.220 --> 16:23.350
who were looking to, uh,
lose some money, I think,

16:23.350 --> 16:27.470
and so they formed
this record company
and signed Blaze.

16:27.470 --> 16:30.220
He had met Kinky Friedman
somewhere,

16:30.220 --> 16:34.430
and Kinky invited Blaze
to come to New York City
and open for him.

16:34.430 --> 16:37.930
And so Blaze
talked Zephyr Records
into buying him a ticket,

16:37.930 --> 16:39.560
and of course,
it was a disaster.

16:39.560 --> 16:42.470
As we say in New York,
"Never 'hoid of him!"

16:42.470 --> 16:45.350
Fuck, I don't know.
I have forgotten
the first half of my life.

16:45.350 --> 16:48.640
By the time that I got up
to New York to play these
shows with Blaze,

16:48.640 --> 16:51.980
he was ensconced
in the Gramercy Park Hotel

16:51.980 --> 16:53.770
and up to no good.

16:53.770 --> 16:56.850
Amphetamines
and binge drinking.

16:56.850 --> 17:00.430
He just had this amazing
ability to fuck it up.

17:00.430 --> 17:03.600
Mike: Zephyr Records went bust
with the energy crisis,

17:03.600 --> 17:05.890
but not before
pressing some 45s

17:05.890 --> 17:08.850
of the best song
Blaze had in his repertoire.

17:08.850 --> 17:13.180
I remember him playing,
"If I Could Only Fly"
for the first time,

17:13.180 --> 17:16.810
and both of us crying,
and, you know...

17:16.810 --> 17:19.560
I see that song as, um,

17:19.560 --> 17:22.270
sort of a lament about...

17:22.270 --> 17:24.930
the consequences
of rootlessness.

17:24.930 --> 17:26.850
You know, he was saying,

17:26.850 --> 17:28.140
"This is who I am."

we had thousands of 'em,

17:57.020 --> 18:00.640
and Blaze, of course,
was trading them
for drinks in bars.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.600
Larry: I never knew him
to have a job.

18:02.600 --> 18:06.390
He said, "I have vowed
never to have a day job,

18:06.390 --> 18:08.270

18:08.270 --> 18:10.350

He was making decent bucks
at the time, Townes was.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.730
He had entrée
into a lot of circles

18:34.730 --> 18:36.060
that Blaze didn't have,

18:36.060 --> 18:38.390
like the Kerrville
Folk Festival. (laughs)

18:38.390 --> 18:40.020
Mike:
The Kerrville Folk Festival

18:40.020 --> 18:41.930
had hosted artists
like Townes,

18:41.930 --> 18:44.520
Lyle Lovett,
Lucinda Williams,

18:44.520 --> 18:47.930
and Peter, Paul & Mary,
since 1972.

18:47.930 --> 18:51.100
It's a big event around here,
especially for us songwriters.

18:51.100 --> 18:53.180
You got on the campground,
people jamming,

18:53.180 --> 18:55.310
everybody's singing
their own songs.

18:55.310 --> 18:57.560
Singer-songwriter Ky Hote

18:57.560 --> 18:59.810
hosts the  Underground
Kerrville Review,

18:59.810 --> 19:02.140
and has been playing
the festival for decades.

19:02.140 --> 19:05.020
Rod Kennedy runs
the Kerrville Folk Festival,

19:05.020 --> 19:07.890
and Rod's kind of a--
He can be a little...

19:07.890 --> 19:09.560
reactionary.

19:09.560 --> 19:11.560
A few people have been
kicked out of there

19:11.560 --> 19:13.810
for swearing on-stage,
you know,

19:13.810 --> 19:16.350
banned for years,
you know, just for,

19:16.350 --> 19:18.390
for saying "fuck"
or something, you know,

19:18.390 --> 19:20.560
and Blaze wasn't gonna
shy away from any of that.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.890
He had these songs
and he was just gonna
play them.

19:22.890 --> 19:25.810
Townes got him
a guest spot at Kerrville,

19:25.810 --> 19:28.060
and he sang the song
about Idi Amin.

19:28.060 --> 19:31.770
Mike:
Idi Amin was the dictator
of Uganda at the time.

19:31.770 --> 19:34.220
He was all over the news
with rumors of having killed

19:34.220 --> 19:36.600
hundreds of thousands
of his own people

19:36.600 --> 19:39.180
and engaging in
cannibalistic rituals.

19:39.180 --> 19:43.730
♪ Kampala, Uganda,
on Saturday night ♪

19:43.730 --> 19:48.100
♪ Idi Amin just stepped out
for a bite ♪

19:48.100 --> 19:50.310
♪ The waitress,
she asked him ♪

19:50.310 --> 19:52.560
♪ "Can I help you, please?" ♪

19:52.560 --> 19:57.220
♪ "A platter of elbows,
a bowl full of knees"... ♪

19:57.220 --> 20:01.470
Rod Kennedy told him,
"You're banned from here
for life.

20:01.470 --> 20:03.520
You cannot ever
come back here."

20:03.520 --> 20:06.060
That was his response to...

20:06.060 --> 20:08.560
the "Springtime in Uganda"
thing.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.640
Rod got the hook
and got him off stage.

20:10.640 --> 20:13.390
Mike:
Folk singer Carlene Jones
and Ky Hote

20:13.390 --> 20:16.470
were both there when Blaze
tried to come back
to Kerrville.

20:16.470 --> 20:19.930
It was the middle of the night,
we're all camping out there.

20:19.930 --> 20:21.810
So I wake up
early in the morning

20:21.810 --> 20:23.560
and I'd been up late,

20:23.560 --> 20:25.350
and I'm tired,
I haven't had coffee.

20:25.350 --> 20:28.350
I walk over to this campfire,
I sit down.

20:28.350 --> 20:30.560
I look to the left of me

20:30.560 --> 20:33.810
and here's this big woman,

20:33.810 --> 20:35.850
I think.

20:35.850 --> 20:37.810
Ugly, ugly.

20:37.810 --> 20:38.930
I just look away.

20:38.930 --> 20:42.220
He decided to put on
a disguise, and, uh,

20:42.220 --> 20:45.390
he painted his fingernails
this god-awful color of maroon,

20:45.390 --> 20:47.930
and he had this batik skirt,
and a frilly white blouse,

20:47.930 --> 20:50.770
a bandana around his head,
you know, lipstick.

20:50.770 --> 20:53.470
And then I hear
this voice, "Ky...

20:53.470 --> 20:55.180
"It's me, Blaze.

20:55.180 --> 20:56.980
I'm incognito."

20:56.980 --> 20:59.470
Mike:
Rod Kennedy
threw him out again.

20:59.470 --> 21:01.770
But as the man himself
remembers,

21:01.770 --> 21:03.520
that wasn't nearly
the end of it.

21:03.520 --> 21:06.140
I think it was probably
two or three months later,

21:06.140 --> 21:08.640
we were in Emma Joe's,
and he spat

21:08.640 --> 21:10.430
across the room
and hit me in the face.

21:10.430 --> 21:11.850
He just spit on him.

21:11.850 --> 21:13.390
Blaze had a bad habit of,

21:13.390 --> 21:16.310
when he'd get really wasted,
spitting on people.

21:16.310 --> 21:19.180
He never did it to me.
(laughing)

21:19.180 --> 21:21.270
I would have vomited on him.

21:21.270 --> 21:23.180
Rod Kennedy was a badass,

21:23.180 --> 21:25.850
and Blaze took
a beating on that one.
Yeah.

21:25.850 --> 21:28.430
I'd been out
of the Marine Corps
too short a time

21:28.430 --> 21:30.770
to control what was
an instantaneous,

21:30.770 --> 21:32.640
almost involuntary reaction.

21:32.640 --> 21:35.560
And I think
I flew through the air
and hit him about chest high.

21:35.560 --> 21:38.180
He was sitting at a table,
and grabbed him by the ears

21:38.180 --> 21:39.430
and slammed his head
on the floor

21:39.430 --> 21:41.470
until somebody
pulled me off of him.

21:41.470 --> 21:43.310
I'd heard that he had spent

21:43.310 --> 21:48.640
the Christmas holidays
of 1988 in jail,

21:48.640 --> 21:50.640
that he had beat up somebody.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.100
And it sounded
out of character to me.

21:53.100 --> 21:57.310
Mandy:
He was always really sweet
to children and older people,

21:57.310 --> 22:00.100
and anybody he thought
had soul and was cool.

22:00.100 --> 22:01.520
He liked this older man,

22:01.520 --> 22:05.100
an elderly
African-American gentleman

22:05.100 --> 22:06.770
named Concho January.

22:06.770 --> 22:10.020
I said, "I heard you just
got out of jail. What happened?"

22:10.020 --> 22:13.390
And he said,
"Well, I know this old guy
named Concho,

22:13.390 --> 22:15.430
"and his son beats him up

22:15.430 --> 22:19.430
"and takes his Social Security
money and spends it on heroin.

22:19.430 --> 22:21.930
"And I just won't let him
do that.

22:21.930 --> 22:25.060
And we got in a fight
and I kicked his ass."

22:25.060 --> 22:27.390
And I said, "Well, Blaze,
you got to be careful."

22:27.390 --> 22:30.020
He said, "Well, this kid
may kill me,

22:30.020 --> 22:32.430
but I'm not gonna let him
beat up his dad."

22:32.430 --> 22:34.600
Apparently, there had been
several confrontations,

22:34.600 --> 22:37.270
and the reason I know it,
it happened more than once,

22:37.270 --> 22:39.020
was that Mr. January's son

22:39.020 --> 22:41.600
actually took out
a restraining order
against Blaze.

22:41.600 --> 22:45.270
He was supposedly
not even supposed to be
over there anymore.

22:45.270 --> 22:48.020
Concho, he loved Blaze,
he really did.

22:48.020 --> 22:50.770
Blaze was the person
who cared about him,

22:50.770 --> 22:53.060
and who was trying
to take care of him,

22:53.060 --> 22:54.520
trying to protect him.

22:54.520 --> 22:55.930
It was his character.

22:55.930 --> 22:57.890
That's the way he was
right up to the time

22:57.890 --> 22:59.600
that he was shot.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.140
You know, he was defending
another guy.

23:02.140 --> 23:05.680
Mike:
On the first day
of February, 1989,

23:05.680 --> 23:08.060
the day the government
checks arrive,

23:08.060 --> 23:10.730
Concho January's son
came to the house.

23:10.730 --> 23:16.310
By the time he left,
Blaze Foley had a bullet wound
in his liver from a .22 rifle.

23:16.310 --> 23:18.060
He was dead within hours.

23:18.060 --> 23:19.810
The day of the funeral,

23:19.810 --> 23:21.640
once some songs got sung,

23:21.640 --> 23:24.310
people decorated the casket
with the duct tape,

23:24.310 --> 23:28.770
and I remember as it was
being lowered down that--

23:28.770 --> 23:32.430
that Blaze probably would have
got a kick out of seeing
that happen.

23:32.430 --> 23:35.470
They labeled him
the Duct Tape Messiah.

23:35.470 --> 23:38.270
Mike:
Seven months later,
Concho's son was acquitted

23:38.270 --> 23:40.680
of first-degree
premeditated murder.

23:40.680 --> 23:44.600
Even though the old man
could not have been
more clear in his deposition,

23:44.600 --> 23:46.430
the jury found
that Concho's son

23:46.430 --> 23:48.730
shot Blaze in self-defense.

23:48.730 --> 23:52.560
The spookiest thing about it
was before Blaze got killed,

23:52.560 --> 23:55.890
he finally got a song covered
by Merle Haggard.

23:55.890 --> 23:59.270
He recorded,

24:52.560 --> 24:55.470

24:55.470 --> 24:58.850
And I came back from LA,
where I was living,

24:58.850 --> 25:02.100

and he showed me his room,

25:02.100 --> 25:03.850
and he was so proud of it.

25:03.850 --> 25:06.020
And then, a couple of weeks--

26:19.350 --> 26:21.220
to get 'em
to go get diet pills.

26:21.220 --> 26:24.140
All the fat girls in town
was over at my house.

26:24.140 --> 26:25.810
I'd say,
"Baby, go on over there

26:25.810 --> 26:28.730
and get them pills, now,
and come on back over here."

26:28.730 --> 26:31.060
And, I mean, I had all
the fat women in town

26:31.060 --> 26:32.520
bringing me speed in the '70s,

26:32.520 --> 26:35.810
till they cut that out,
you know, in about '73.

26:35.810 --> 26:37.390
No one, no one.

26:37.390 --> 26:39.020
You couldn't get no diet pills.

26:39.020 --> 26:41.060
(car engine revs)
