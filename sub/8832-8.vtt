14:04.933 --> 14:06.267
>>

14:06.267 --> 14:07.233
>> WHO'S A JERK?

14:07.233 --> 14:08.900
>> JERKS. LIKE, REAL JERKS.

14:08.933 --> 14:09.767
LIKE -- LIKE, THE DRAFT --

14:09.767 --> 14:10.800
NO ONE WANTS TO BRING THE DRAFT

14:10.800 --> 14:11.700
BACK, BUT IF YOU'RE A JERK,

14:11.700 --> 14:13.067
WE'LL DRAFT YOU.

14:15.067 --> 14:16.167
YOU'RE ON THE SUBWAY, AND

14:16.167 --> 14:17.600
THERE'S A LADY STANDING UP, AND

14:17.600 --> 14:19.067
SHE'S QUESTIONABLY PREGNANT, AND

14:19.067 --> 14:20.433
THERE'S A GUY SITTING RIGHT IN

14:20.433 --> 14:21.133
FRONT OF HER.

14:21.133 --> 14:22.233
THAT GUY IS A JERK.

14:22.233 --> 14:23.267
>> MAYBE HE'S ILL.

14:23.267 --> 14:24.433
SOME PEOPLE GOT GOUT.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.767
>> IF WE PUT A GOUT CLAUSE IN

14:28.767 --> 14:30.300
THE PETITION, HOW ABOUT THAT?

14:30.300 --> 14:31.200
FAIR ENOUGH?

14:31.200 --> 14:32.900
>> WELL, NO, BECAUSE THERE'S

14:32.900 --> 14:34.200
MORE THAN JUST GOUT.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.067
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS.

14:35.067 --> 14:36.067
>> THERE'S MORE THAN JUST GOUT?

14:36.067 --> 14:37.233
>> THIS GUY IS RATIONALIZING WHY

14:37.233 --> 14:38.267
JERKS ARE NOT GOOD FOR THE

14:38.267 --> 14:38.633
DRAFT.

14:38.633 --> 14:39.900
>> I MEAN, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO,

14:39.900 --> 14:41.133
GO AROUND AND ASK EACH AND EVERY

14:41.133 --> 14:41.667
GUY WE SEE?

14:41.667 --> 14:43.433
GUYS THAT'S NOT A JERK THAT'S AT

14:43.433 --> 14:43.867
WAR?

14:43.867 --> 14:45.167
I THINK EVERYBODY THAT GO TO WAR

14:45.167 --> 14:45.667
IS A JERK.

14:45.667 --> 14:46.333
>> YEAH, SURE.

14:46.333 --> 14:47.333
>> I MEAN, THAT'S MY OWN

14:47.333 --> 14:47.900
PHILOSOPHY.

14:47.900 --> 14:49.400
YOU CAN'T STRAIGHTEN NO ONE ELSE

14:49.400 --> 14:49.767
OUT.

14:49.767 --> 14:51.100
YOU DON'T WANT TO SEND YOUR

14:51.100 --> 14:52.067
FAMILY OVER THERE.

14:52.067 --> 14:52.467
>> YEAH.

14:52.467 --> 14:53.600
>> NO ONE'S GONNA SEND THEIR

14:53.600 --> 14:54.367
FAMILY OVER THERE.

14:54.367 --> 14:55.867
I MIGHT BE A JERK, AS WELL.

14:55.867 --> 14:57.333
I THINK THEY'RE ALL JERKS.

14:57.333 --> 14:58.633
HE MIGHT CONSIDER YOU A JERK.

14:58.633 --> 15:00.100
AND I JUST GOT A TICKET FOR

15:00.100 --> 15:01.633
GOING BETWEEN THE SUBWAY CARS.

15:01.633 --> 15:02.900
HE'S THE GUY THAT'S WORKING FOR

15:02.900 --> 15:03.600
THE GOVERNMENT.

15:03.600 --> 15:04.867
>> SO, MAYBE WE SHOULD DRAFT ALL

15:04.867 --> 15:06.067
THE GOVERNMENT AND SEND THOSE

15:06.067 --> 15:06.767
JERKS OVERSEAS.

15:06.767 --> 15:07.867
>> THAT'S WHO SHOULD GO.

15:07.867 --> 15:08.567
>> ALL RIGHT!

15:08.567 --> 15:09.833
SO, LET'S SIGN THIS .

15:09.833 --> 15:10.700

15:11.467 --> 15:12.633
HE -- HE LOST HIMSELF.

15:12.633 --> 15:13.933
HE GOES, "LET'S SIGN THIS

15:13.933 --> 15:14.500
"

15:14.500 --> 15:15.333
"SAYING WHAT?"

15:15.333 --> 15:16.467
HE LOST HIMSELF IN THAT WHOLE

15:16.467 --> 15:17.067
CONVERSATION.

15:17.067 --> 15:18.267
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE'S

15:18.267 --> 15:19.167
TALKING ABOUT ANYMORE.

15:19.167 --> 15:20.067
>> PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

15:20.067 --> 15:20.600
THANK YOU, MAN.

15:20.600 --> 15:21.400
>> AW!

15:21.400 --> 15:23.067
>> COULDN'T GET IT, COULDN'T GET

15:23.067 --> 15:23.400
IT.

15:24.767 --> 15:26.333
>> Narrator: IT'S A LOST CAUSE

15:26.333 --> 15:27.900
FOR MURR, MAKING HIM TONIGHT'S

15:27.900 --> 15:29.767
BIG LOSER.

15:29.767 --> 15:31.600
>> AND HERE WE ARE, WITH OUR

15:31.600 --> 15:32.533
LOSER, MURR!

15:32.533 --> 15:33.167
>> THERE HE IS.

15:33.167 --> 15:33.933
>> YEAH, HERE WE GO.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.067
WELL, ALL YOU GOT TO DO, BUD --

15:35.067 --> 15:35.800
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE.

15:35.800 --> 15:36.367
>> YEAH.

15:36.367 --> 15:37.700
>> LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

15:37.700 --> 15:39.100
JUST GO.

15:39.100 --> 15:39.633
>> JUST LEAVE?

15:39.633 --> 15:40.633
>> WE'RE NOT TELLING YOU WHAT

15:40.633 --> 15:40.933
IT IS.

15:40.933 --> 15:41.967
YOU'RE NOT GONNA KNOW UNTIL IT

15:41.967 --> 15:42.333
HAPPENS.

15:42.333 --> 15:42.767
>> I JUST --

15:42.767 --> 15:43.200
>> THAT'S IT.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.100
>> GO OUT THE DOOR.

15:44.100 --> 15:45.167
>> JUST SIT DOWN, BUDDY.

15:45.167 --> 15:45.867
JUST SIT DOWN.

15:45.867 --> 15:46.533
>> YEAH, ENJOY.

15:46.533 --> 15:47.067
>> JUST GO.

15:47.067 --> 15:47.667
>> I CAN SIT.

15:47.667 --> 15:48.067
>> OKAY.

15:48.067 --> 15:49.067
>> DOESN'T GET EASIER THAN THAT.

15:49.067 --> 15:50.067
>> SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY EASY

15:50.067 --> 15:50.433
PUNISHMENT.

15:50.433 --> 15:50.900
>> BYE!

15:50.900 --> 15:51.367
>> BYE!

15:51.367 --> 15:53.233
>> BYE-BYE.

15:53.233 --> 15:55.067
>> WE'RE SCREENING MURRAY'S FILM

15:55.067 --> 15:56.833
"DAMNED!" THAT HE MADE IN, WHAT,

15:56.833 --> 15:57.267
'98?

15:57.267 --> 15:58.233
>> '98 -- 1998.

15:58.233 --> 15:59.300
>> HE SELF-PRODUCED IT, HE

15:59.300 --> 16:00.633
DIRECTED IT, HE WROTE IT, HE DID

16:00.633 --> 16:01.467
EVERYTHING WITH IT.

16:01.467 --> 16:02.300
>> IT'S TERRIBLE.

16:02.300 --> 16:03.067
IT IS TERRIBLE.

16:03.067 --> 16:04.333
>> HE'S BEEN TRYING TO BURY IT

16:04.333 --> 16:05.067
FOR 20 YEARS.

16:05.067 --> 16:06.400
>> HE SUCCESSFULLY BURIED IT

16:06.400 --> 16:07.300
UNTIL RIGHT NOW.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.367
>> GUESS WHO'S GOT SOME SHOVELS?

YOUR LIFE.

16:31.300 --> 16:32.700
>> SON?

16:32.700 --> 16:34.100
>> GOD?

16:34.100 --> 16:35.200
>> CALL ME DAD.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.933
>> I'M NOT CALLING YOU DAD!

16:36.933 --> 16:38.433
>> ARE WE GONNA START THIS

16:38.433 --> 16:39.067
AGAIN?!

16:39.067 --> 16:40.667
>> I DON'T KNOW, GOD, ARE WE?!

16:41.800 --> 16:43.633
>> SO, MURRAY'S MOVIE IS ABOUT

16:43.633 --> 16:45.533
TEEN JESUS SET IN MODERN TIMES.

16:55.967 --> 16:56.333
MURRAY!

16:56.333 --> 16:57.667
>> THERE HE IS.

16:58.533 --> 16:59.733
IT'S LIKE ALFRED HITCHCOCK

16:59.733 --> 17:01.067
SHOWING UP IN HIS OWN MOVIE.

17:01.067 --> 17:03.100
>> HOLY !

17:04.267 --> 17:04.967
AAH!

17:04.967 --> 17:06.700

17:37.933 --> 17:40.467
>> IN THE BACK OF AN AMBULANCE

17:40.467 --> 17:41.533
IN 1995...

17:41.533 --> 17:42.400
>>

17:42.400 --> 17:43.933
>> ...I WATCHED MY FATHER PASS

17:43.933 --> 17:45.333
FROM THIS WORLD TO ANOTHER.

17:45.333 --> 17:48.067
MY LOOK WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THIS

17:48.067 --> 17:49.500
GUY RIGHT HERE.

17:49.500 --> 17:50.667
>>

17:50.667 --> 17:52.767
>> VICTORY OR DEATH?!

17:57.233 --> 17:59.233
>> POW!

17:59.233 --> 18:00.167
OH!

18:00.167 --> 18:01.533
OH!

18:29.867 --> 18:31.367
JAMES S. MURRAY.

18:32.800 --> 18:33.900
>> GET UP THERE!

18:35.133 --> 18:36.733
>> IT'S NOT OVER YET!

18:39.533 --> 18:41.067
>> THIS WAS THE FIRST FILM.

18:41.067 --> 18:41.600
>> YES.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.333
>> POSSIBLY, THE BUDGET WAS VERY

18:43.333 --> 18:43.867
TIGHT.

18:43.867 --> 18:46.067
>> UH, THE BUDGET WAS ABOUT

18:46.067 --> 18:47.933
$25,000, $30,000.

18:51.333 --> 18:52.400
>> WHERE DID THE MONEY COME

18:52.400 --> 18:52.733
FROM?

18:52.733 --> 18:54.600
>> WHEN I GRADUATED COLLEGE, MY

18:54.600 --> 18:56.167
DAD SAID, "I'LL BUY YOU A

18:56.167 --> 18:57.833
FORD TAURUS AS A GRADUATION

18:57.833 --> 18:58.400
GIFT."

18:58.400 --> 19:01.067
AND I SAID, "INSTEAD OF THE CAR,

19:01.067 --> 19:03.967
CAN I USE THAT MONEY, UH, TO

19:03.967 --> 19:05.300
MAKE A FILM?"

19:05.300 --> 19:06.800
I DID IT, AND I USED THAT MONEY

19:06.800 --> 19:07.733
TO MAKE THE MOVIE.

19:07.733 --> 19:09.867
>> HE MUST BE VERY PROUD.

19:09.867 --> 19:11.767
>>

19:11.767 --> 19:12.667
YOU KNOW...

19:14.867 --> 19:16.300
>>  YOU COULD HAVE

19:16.300 --> 19:16.933
HAD A CAR.

19:17.967 --> 19:19.200
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR

19:19.200 --> 19:20.100
DIRECTING STYLE.

19:20.100 --> 19:21.600
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WOULD SAY

19:21.600 --> 19:23.133
THAT NO STYLE IS A STYLE IN AND

19:23.133 --> 19:23.767
OF ITSELF.

19:26.900 --> 19:30.533
DID YOU GO TO FILM SCHOOL?

19:30.533 --> 19:32.067
>> NO, I WAS AN ENGLISH

19:32.067 --> 19:33.133
LITERATURE MAJOR.

19:33.133 --> 19:34.867
>> SO, YOU WOULD THINK YOU WOULD

19:34.867 --> 19:35.900
KNOW ABOUT STORY.

19:38.067 --> 19:39.367
>> OH!

19:39.367 --> 19:40.767
>> ONE WOULD THINK, YES.

19:44.633 --> 19:46.667
>> I'VE TRIED TO TAKE INTO

19:46.667 --> 19:49.067
ACCOUNT THAT YOU WERE YOUNG, BUT

19:49.067 --> 19:51.500
ORSON WELLES WAS IN HIS 20s WHEN

19:51.500 --> 19:52.900
HE MADE "CITIZEN KANE."

19:52.900 --> 19:54.067
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

19:58.300 --> 19:59.800
>> IS THERE ANY WAY WE COULD

19:59.800 --> 20:01.333
HAVE HER HANG OUT WITH US ALL

20:01.333 --> 20:03.033
THE TIME SO SHE CAN CUT HIM DOWN

20:03.033 --> 20:04.333
EVERY DAY, ALL DAY LONG?

20:05.633 --> 20:07.400
>> UM, WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU

20:07.400 --> 20:10.233
GIVE FILMMAKERS STARTING OUT,

20:10.233 --> 20:12.100
UM, IN ORDER TO HELP THEM TO

20:12.100 --> 20:13.533
AVOID THE PITFALLS THAT YOU

20:13.533 --> 20:14.767
CLEARLY FELL INTO?

20:15.967 --> 20:18.267
>> UM, IF I COULD GO BACK IN

20:18.267 --> 20:19.067
TIME

20:19.067 --> 20:20.033
I WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE FORD

20:20.033 --> 20:20.933
TAURAUS

20:24.433 --> 20:26.267
THANK YOU JAMES S MURRAY AND

20:26.267 --> 20:27.733
GOOD NIGHT.
