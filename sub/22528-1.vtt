02:19.360 --> 02:21.000
<i>Any change, Meecham?</i>

02:21.680 --> 02:23.400
<i>I still have hope, Doctor.</i>

03:41.320 --> 03:46.960
BETHLEM HOSPITAL, LONDON, 1830

03:51.480 --> 03:52.960
Lost cause this one, Father.

03:53.340 --> 03:55.260
God's left him long passed.

03:56.280 --> 03:57.680
God leaves no one.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.720
Will you pray with me, my son?

04:09.880 --> 04:11.200
Come back to us, John.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.080
<i>Come back to us.</i>

04:21.120 --> 04:22.120
My son.

04:32.560 --> 04:33.640
John?

06:09.960 --> 06:11.120
<i>He lives.</i>

06:12.120 --> 06:13.120
He lives.

07:05.100 --> 07:06.100
Come on.

07:06.620 --> 07:07.820
Back to bed will you.

07:09.860 --> 07:10.860
Enough!

07:25.940 --> 07:26.940
Enough!

07:28.340 --> 07:29.380
Enough now!

07:30.860 --> 07:32.260
Don't make me...

08:18.180 --> 08:19.380
Forgive me.

09:12.100 --> 09:13.340
Out of the way!

09:14.740 --> 09:16.100
Out of the way!

09:45.640 --> 09:47.740
<i>Let me show you where you were born.</i>

09:54.760 --> 09:56.360
<i>My Adam.</i>

10:41.780 --> 10:44.180
<i>You are the next step.</i>

11:03.380 --> 11:06.340
JOHANN DIPPEL

11:33.740 --> 11:34.860
Jemima.

11:42.300 --> 11:44.199
You told me that if Daniel succeeded,

11:44.200 --> 11:45.900
then we would be in a world without God.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.420
And I would be as guilty for it as he.

11:53.020 --> 11:54.340
Well, he has...

11:57.020 --> 11:58.220
and I am.

12:00.440 --> 12:01.640
I was lost.

12:04.240 --> 12:05.480
I couldn't find you.

12:17.240 --> 12:18.960
There will be another one after you...

12:20.240 --> 12:21.480
and others after that.

12:26.520 --> 12:29.880
Fire and water and ice.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.060
You must find him.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.240
You must do this for me.

12:50.960 --> 12:53.120
Heaven is closed to both of us.

13:12.140 --> 13:14.400
Fire and water and ice.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.439
Where are you?

13:18.440 --> 13:20.760
You must find him.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.040
You must do this for me.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.480
<i>You must find him.</i>

14:26.120 --> 14:27.800
<i>You must do this for me.</i>

14:57.240 --> 15:00.840
They say the body is a real mess,
like a scene from the Bible.

15:00.880 --> 15:04.280
Who'd kill an Archdeacon but a man
touched by the devil himself?

15:04.880 --> 15:08.000
Ripped out his intestines and his
heart, and his lungs, I heard.

15:12.640 --> 15:16.200
Oi! I told you lot to get
down to the coroner's office.

15:17.520 --> 15:18.840
Sergeant Nightingale.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.480
Inspector Treadaway.

15:24.040 --> 15:25.040
Look at this.

15:25.480 --> 15:27.840
Sir Robert's Great
Metropolitan experiment.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.559
At Bow Street, I went out
and got things done.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.559
Now I spend all day writing
about it in triplicate.

15:33.560 --> 15:36.887
Detailed records are the
future, sir. I do believe it.

15:36.888 --> 15:38.303
I think you might be right, Sergeant.

15:38.304 --> 15:40.200
Because they're no bloody use
to us here in the present.

15:41.380 --> 15:42.860
Have you finished at Portugal Street?

15:43.480 --> 15:45.959
As I suggested, it was
a crime of passion.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.479
It was the husband himself
who killed his wife.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.839
- You got him to admit to it?
- No need, sir.

15:50.840 --> 15:52.720
The evidence admits all.

15:55.560 --> 15:56.640
Good work, Sergeant.

15:57.640 --> 15:58.640
Very good.

16:00.080 --> 16:02.040
Murder is definitely your talent.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.440
I have another one with your name to it.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.039
- The murder of the Archdeacon?
- No,

16:08.040 --> 16:09.359
a guard at Bethlem,

16:09.360 --> 16:12.019
killed by an escaped
lunatic in his flight.

16:12.020 --> 16:14.199
Bethlem is under Southwark Watchhouse.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.596
But the tollman on Regent Bridge

16:16.597 --> 16:18.728
spied the lunatic crossing the river.

16:18.730 --> 16:21.280
Which makes him the
concern of Westminster.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.119
How did the guard die?

16:23.120 --> 16:25.439
Throat slit ear to ear, I'm told.

16:25.440 --> 16:26.760
Horrible business.

16:27.560 --> 16:29.080
Constable Bircher!

16:32.240 --> 16:34.760
You'll be assisting Sergeant
Nightingale in his enquiries.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.755
- Sergeant Nightingale...
- If you wish to rise

16:41.756 --> 16:43.420
above the rank of constable,

16:43.421 --> 16:45.559
you need to be more
conscientious with your work

16:45.560 --> 16:48.004
rather than fueling babble and hearsay.

16:48.006 --> 16:49.006
Understood?

16:49.520 --> 16:50.520
Yes, sir.

17:12.560 --> 17:15.800
We've come for the body of the
Archdeacon. Hand him over.

17:18.240 --> 17:21.039
This murder is the concern of the
church coroner, Mr. Renquist.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.079
- Says who?
- Says the church!

17:23.632 --> 17:25.679
Out. Get him out!

17:25.680 --> 17:28.240
I don't take orders
from Charlies like you.

17:30.013 --> 17:31.939
But maybe you will accept the authority

17:31.941 --> 17:34.314
of the Very Reverend Dean of Westminster

17:35.840 --> 17:38.279
when I tell you that you
have no jurisdiction here.

17:38.280 --> 17:41.000
The Parish Watch are in
charge, not the police.

17:52.826 --> 17:54.506
Never let that happen again.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.240
Yes, sir.

18:55.673 --> 18:56.953
How can I help you?

19:00.266 --> 19:02.106
I was abandoned by God.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.240
And now you seek His sanctuary?

19:15.000 --> 19:16.560
So, it is you, John Marlott.

19:17.213 --> 19:18.707
I am not John Marlott.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.320
Yet you walk in his image.

19:22.413 --> 19:25.013
- Why?
- To find Daniel Hervey...

19:27.340 --> 19:29.420
and show him God's vengeance.

19:30.660 --> 19:31.660
No.

19:33.687 --> 19:35.247
The man I knew...

19:36.040 --> 19:37.960
This man I see before me...

19:38.912 --> 19:41.031
You were not a man of vengeance.

19:41.460 --> 19:42.700
Who was I?

19:43.200 --> 19:45.000
You were a man of kindness.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.131
A man of justice.

19:48.133 --> 19:49.493
Justice?

19:53.400 --> 19:55.200
I was shown no justice.

19:57.240 --> 20:00.760
Now, I walk a wasteland, Father.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.240
A world forsaken.

20:05.800 --> 20:08.360
It is the poor who are
forsaken, not the world.

20:08.807 --> 20:11.599
And what they crave is justice.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.680
- Then, we are all abandoned.
- No, no!

20:15.310 --> 20:19.080
Here in Pye Street, it is the
church who has abandoned us.

20:19.640 --> 20:22.320
The church, not God.

20:24.800 --> 20:27.520
My flock lies here

20:28.360 --> 20:30.160
in the cradle of the church,

20:30.800 --> 20:32.480
under the gaze of God.

20:33.800 --> 20:37.120
Yet every day, they wander
further into the valley of death

20:38.040 --> 20:40.319
<i>while the Dean of Westminster watches on</i>

20:40.320 --> 20:43.479
- <i>and lines his own pockets.</i>
- Deliver us from evil,

20:43.480 --> 20:46.723
for thine is the kingdom, and the power,

20:46.724 --> 20:50.679
and the Glory for ever. Amen.

20:50.680 --> 20:51.720
Amen.

20:56.800 --> 20:57.880
Good morning, Mr. Dean.

20:58.440 --> 21:02.149
Mr. Renquist. Gentlemen,
leave us please?

21:11.560 --> 21:13.799
The Metropolitan police

21:13.800 --> 21:16.878
have begun trespassing on the
murder of the Archdeacon.

21:16.880 --> 21:19.319
Yes, how very irritating.

21:19.320 --> 21:22.675
The Home Secretary wishes to
illustrate the competence

21:22.677 --> 21:24.669
of his new police force.

21:24.671 --> 21:26.680
It feels like desperation.

21:27.093 --> 21:28.253
Nevertheless,

21:29.467 --> 21:31.919
I cannot be expected to
conduct church business

21:31.920 --> 21:33.929
with their continuing interference.

21:35.240 --> 21:36.640
And you shall not.

21:38.120 --> 21:39.860
Even the Home Secretary

21:39.862 --> 21:43.912
will find he cannot refuse
the seal of the King,

21:43.914 --> 21:46.319
who, I'm sure, would not object

21:46.320 --> 21:49.520
to my small appropriation
of his authority.

21:50.360 --> 21:53.440
Westminster is not the
domain of the state.

21:54.060 --> 21:55.798
It is the domain of God.

21:58.093 --> 22:01.413
The King's seal is the final word

22:02.520 --> 22:04.720
and the people will...

22:06.560 --> 22:08.960
have faith in the church.

22:41.700 --> 22:43.740
I rescued them after your arrest.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.820
Do you think I'm guilty of it, Father,

22:53.220 --> 22:54.580
Flora's murder?

22:56.300 --> 22:57.820
That's between you and God.

22:59.660 --> 23:01.180
I won't betray you.

23:03.213 --> 23:04.773
But your clothing might.

23:08.113 --> 23:12.433
Go to this shop and ask for Esther Rose.

23:15.860 --> 23:17.540
She is someone you can trust.

23:26.940 --> 23:28.500
I cannot repay you.

23:30.340 --> 23:32.370
"The wicked borrow and pay not again,

23:32.372 --> 23:34.821
but the righteous show mercy and give."

23:36.580 --> 23:37.723
Is that a Psalm?

23:38.300 --> 23:39.580
That's right.

23:41.840 --> 23:43.040
I remember it.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.820
Do not forsake God, my son.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.360
And do not forsake those
He has in keeping for you.

23:59.873 --> 24:02.313
They still await you on the other side.

24:03.387 --> 24:05.187
I have seen the other side.

24:06.713 --> 24:09.913
I was taken to the meeting
place, but they were both gone.

24:12.720 --> 24:14.240
They were sent on without me.

24:18.120 --> 24:20.839
What marvel brought you
back here, John Marlott?

24:20.840 --> 24:23.320
- I am not John Marlott.
- Then who are you?

24:26.040 --> 24:28.920
I passed beyond God's kingdom.

24:32.200 --> 24:33.680
John Marlott is dead.

24:51.040 --> 24:53.879
"An Archdeacon is murdered in
the very heart of Westminster,

24:53.880 --> 24:55.744
and the Metropolitan
police are instructed

24:55.746 --> 24:57.563
to play no part in such matters"?

24:58.200 --> 25:00.959
The Dean of Westminster
flaps his wings indeed.

25:00.960 --> 25:04.671
The letter did arrive under the seal
of King George, Home Secretary.

25:04.673 --> 25:07.014
And if King George has
witnessed its contents,

25:07.016 --> 25:09.956
then I am a Charing
Cross saddler. No, Fox.

25:09.957 --> 25:13.105
This is the work of the
Dean and no other.

25:18.200 --> 25:21.159
Mr. Dipple. Forgive me, I was
unaware of any appointment.

25:21.160 --> 25:24.239
No forgiveness necessary, Sir
Robert. I am unannounced.

25:24.240 --> 25:27.040
I'm afraid, sir, the Home
Secretary's appointments do not...

25:28.920 --> 25:31.560
Oh, that is quite extraordinary.

25:34.760 --> 25:36.000
Vishnu.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.680
Late seventeenth century.

25:40.120 --> 25:43.479
- West Bengal, I'd hazard.
- Speak plainly, Mr. Dipple.

25:43.480 --> 25:45.480
- What is your business?
- "Speak plainly"?

25:46.246 --> 25:48.046
Novel words from a politician.

25:50.380 --> 25:52.619
We are all aware of your
influence, Mr. Dipple,

25:52.620 --> 25:54.059
but in the seat of Government,

25:54.060 --> 25:56.939
you will do well to address me
with the customary respect.

25:56.940 --> 25:58.340
Sir Robert,

25:58.740 --> 26:01.166
spare me the indignation of tradition.

26:01.168 --> 26:02.859
We are both men of the modern world.

26:02.860 --> 26:06.900
Governments come and go like
the passing of the seasons.

26:07.860 --> 26:09.260
And yours is in trouble.

26:11.420 --> 26:12.900
What is your business?

26:16.060 --> 26:17.859
Fox, would you be so kind as to collect

26:17.860 --> 26:20.660
the minutes of this morning's
Cabinet meeting? Thank you.

26:25.540 --> 26:28.529
There was a murder two
nights ago in Westminster.

26:28.531 --> 26:29.699
The Archdeacon?

26:29.700 --> 26:31.646
And that night also saw the escape

26:31.648 --> 26:33.821
of a dangerous lunatic from Bethlem.

26:34.519 --> 26:36.791
His liberty is of concern to me.

26:36.793 --> 26:38.993
And why should it concern me?

26:41.386 --> 26:45.345
I understand your new cemetery
bill reaches a crucial stage.

26:45.347 --> 26:46.947
As we have discussed.

26:56.960 --> 27:01.039
Mr. Dipple, your support for
this scheme is very generous.

27:01.040 --> 27:05.079
Yes, I believe the swift
apprehension of this man

27:05.080 --> 27:06.431
will hasten the completion

27:07.130 --> 27:10.006
of these documents in
no uncertain measure.

27:11.953 --> 27:13.719
And what will you gain from this?

27:13.720 --> 27:15.039
Me?

27:15.040 --> 27:19.040
Well, you hardly impress as the
Good Sa
