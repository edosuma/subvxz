Previously on "Hellcats  ...  "

00:02.375 --> 00:03.458
You sure school's
worth all this?

00:03.458 --> 00:05.708
I'm going to graduate,
pass the bar up North and work

00:05.708 --> 00:09.333
in a DA's office where everybody
talks in flat Yankee vowels.

00:09.333 --> 00:10.166
You're applying
for a scholarship?

00:10.166 --> 00:12.000
I have one now,
for cheerleading.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.625
Cheerleading? Oh.

00:13.625 --> 00:15.667
Hello, Marti.
Welcome to Cheertown.

00:15.667 --> 00:18.166
I need two pre-law students
to help me.

00:18.166 --> 00:21.667
A man's been sentenced to life
in prison for a minor burglary.

00:21.667 --> 00:23.333
If there's even the slightest
chance that he's innocent--

00:23.333 --> 00:25.542
I took this case
to get a law overturned.

00:25.542 --> 00:28.083
If you pass the bar one day,
you can take up his cause.

00:28.083 --> 00:29.333
Why wait till then?

00:29.333 --> 00:30.458
Vanessa, I'm sure you remember

00:30.458 --> 00:31.792
the famous coach Red Raymond.

00:31.792 --> 00:33.708
Just so we're clear,
I have a boyfriend.

00:33.708 --> 00:34.625
Things change.

00:34.625 --> 00:36.834
That boy is charming,
but he's not serious

00:36.834 --> 00:38.166
and certainly not about you.

00:38.166 --> 00:40.291
This conversation
officially sucks.

00:40.291 --> 00:43.542
If you go through that door,
there is no comin' back.

00:43.542 --> 00:45.375
I just found out
the bid video results.

00:45.375 --> 00:47.166
Of the 15 slots,
we placed 16th.

00:47.166 --> 00:49.375
How do we pay for sectionals,
let alone nationals?

00:49.375 --> 00:50.959
That's a fantastic question.

00:50.959 --> 00:52.875
I owe you one.
Thanks for the save.

00:52.875 --> 00:56.417

Ever since
she was a little girl

01:04.041 --> 01:07.083
Jemma Linkletter dreamt
of being a cheerleader.

01:07.083 --> 01:09.041
She dedicated her life
to the sport

01:09.041 --> 01:11.417
working each day
to achieve her dream

01:11.417 --> 01:14.333
and that dream became a reality
the day Jemma joined

01:14.333 --> 01:17.208
the Western Tennessee
State Mustangs.

01:17.208 --> 01:20.375
That is,

01:39.083 --> 01:41.792
Hi. My name is
Jemma Linkletter

01:41.792 --> 01:44.625
and cheerleading
is still my life.

(Alice)
What a bunch
of sentimental crap.

02:06.291 --> 02:08.500
Those are the jokers
that beat us?

02:08.500 --> 02:09.583
Nothin' like a kid
in a wheelchair

02:09.583 --> 02:11.792
to stir up cheap sentiment.

02:11.792 --> 02:14.000
- 'Their stunting is terrible.'
- No, wait. Look.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.458
Here's where she pops
the wheelie.

02:15.458 --> 02:16.792
- 'Oh.'
- 'Wow.'

02:16.792 --> 02:18.250
(Lewis)
'Can you turn that off, please?'

02:18.250 --> 02:19.750
I can't take any more.
Really.

02:19.750 --> 02:22.583
Oh, no.
I had a broken wrist.

02:22.583 --> 02:23.750
I had a broken wrist.

02:23.750 --> 02:24.792
That could've been all of you

02:24.792 --> 02:26.625
pushing me in that wheelchair.

02:26.625 --> 02:28.458
We would never have
been that cynical.

02:28.458 --> 02:30.000
Okay, let's focus, Alright?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.667
Now that we've lost
our free ride to nationals

02:31.667 --> 02:33.125
we have to take
the scenic route.

02:33.125 --> 02:34.959
The sectionals are in Louisville
in three weeks.

02:34.959 --> 02:37.458
If we're going, we have to get
there on our own dime

02:37.458 --> 02:41.291
which means we need $5000
and we need ideas.

02:41.291 --> 02:43.792
Hey, my gymnastics coach
held a backflip-a-thon

02:43.792 --> 02:46.000
whenever we needed
new team leotards.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.166
People would pledge
a quarter per backflip.

02:48.166 --> 02:52.834
Well, do the math.
$5000 means 20,000 backflips.

02:52.834 --> 02:54.834
I don't know.

02:54.834 --> 02:56.667
Wait up. Y'all ever seen
a date auction before?

02:56.667 --> 02:58.875
- What's that?
- Oh, it's a great idea.

02:58.875 --> 03:00.125
Each of us plans
her own date and then

03:00.125 --> 03:01.875
we go out
with the highest bidder.

03:01.875 --> 03:03.875
I'm tellin' you, the football
team has one every year.

03:03.875 --> 03:05.000
Makes a ton of money.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.333
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:06.333 --> 03:08.000
Well, then let's get busy,
Hellcats.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.583
- Let's do that.
- Yeah.

03:09.583 --> 03:10.792
- Come on.
- Yeah.

03:10.792 --> 03:12.417
(all)
Hellcats!

03:18.959 --> 03:21.291
Hey, you goin' to that place
on Union to get fliers made up?

03:21.291 --> 03:24.000
Yep. They love us and we get
stuff printed super cheap.

03:26.291 --> 03:27.917
Alright, catch you later.

03:31.333 --> 03:33.750
Hey! Whoa!
Give that back to me.

03:33.750 --> 03:34.834
Well, you gotta
tell me already.

03:34.834 --> 03:36.208
Tell you what?

03:36.208 --> 03:37.708
All the sneaking out
at all hours

03:37.708 --> 03:39.250
the texting, the smiling.

03:41.041 --> 03:42.750
There's a guy, isn't there?

03:42.750 --> 03:44.917
You're spying on me?

03:44.917 --> 03:47.333
Poor form, roomie.

03:47.333 --> 03:48.875
- I see you deleting.
- No, you don't.

03:48.875 --> 03:50.208
Yeah. You were just
deleting right--

03:50.208 --> 03:52.041
- No, I was not.
- Yeah, you were.

03:52.041 --> 03:54.208
- You're gonna tell me.
- No, I'm not.

03:54.208 --> 03:56.375
Okay, come on.
The curiosity is killing me.

03:57.708 --> 03:59.583
Oh, God.

03:59.583 --> 04:01.875
It's your little
law class friend.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.083
I'm right, aren't I?

04:03.083 --> 04:05.166
- He's the guy.
- What, Morgan?

04:05.166 --> 04:08.000
Ugh. Please. I'm actually going
out of my way to avoid him.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.708
Why? He's cute.

04:11.583 --> 04:14.250
Yeah, well, he could also
be big trouble for me.

04:14.250 --> 04:15.917
What kind of trouble?

04:15.917 --> 04:17.583
Remember that law case
I've been working on

04:17.583 --> 04:19.583
for the three-strikes project?

04:19.583 --> 04:21.708
Well, I think the guy they've
got behind bars is innocent.

04:21.708 --> 04:23.583
I've been trying to prove it.

04:23.583 --> 04:26.125
If my law professor finds out
I've been going rogue

04:26.125 --> 04:27.959
I'll get bounced from the class.

04:27.959 --> 04:29.500
I don't trust Morgan
to not bust me.

04:31.083 --> 04:33.750
Oh. It's like
romancing the stone.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.583
You and Morgan hate each other
right up to the moment

04:35.583 --> 04:38.208
where he saves you from the
crocodile and your lips meet.

04:38.208 --> 04:39.750
Then it's nothin' but fireworks.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.041
You're a freak.

04:41.041 --> 04:42.458
Okay, nothing happens
in the squad

04:42.458 --> 04:43.542
that I don't know about.

04:43.542 --> 04:44.917
There is no guy.

04:50.250 --> 04:53.125
Bedspreads are hideous.

04:53.125 --> 04:55.291
They're coverlets.

04:55.291 --> 04:57.959
Who let you in here?

04:57.959 --> 04:59.458
You going somewhere?

04:59.458 --> 05:02.333
Thinking of dropping
by the prison?

05:02.333 --> 05:03.583
Why would you say that?

05:06.417 --> 05:08.667
Julian needed another signature
from Travis Guthrie

05:08.667 --> 05:10.667
and sent me back there.

05:12.250 --> 05:14.125
I saw your name
on the sign-in sheet three times

05:14.125 --> 05:16.500
and I wanna know why
you went back on your own.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.291
Is the impervious
Morgan Pepper worried

05:18.291 --> 05:20.500
a mere cheerleader will steal
his thunder in class?

05:20.500 --> 05:23.125
It would be a huge mistake
to try to one-up me.

05:23.125 --> 05:25.166
I've been bringing
Travis a guitar to play

05:25.166 --> 05:26.875
so he can feel human again.

05:31.625 --> 05:33.083
And get your face
out of my room.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.667
- What?
- Huh? Yeah.

05:36.583 --> 05:38.000
There we go.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.166
Hey, can I get an opinion

05:39.166 --> 05:40.458
on my date for the auction?

05:40.458 --> 05:41.750
Mm-hmm.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.625
Alright.

05:43.625 --> 05:45.959
I was thinking of offerin'
a personal training session

05:45.959 --> 05:48.708
followed by couple's massage
at a spa.

05:48.708 --> 05:50.333
Is that somethin'
the ladies would like?

05:50.333 --> 05:51.875
Sign me up.

05:51.875 --> 05:53.291
(Savannah)
'I think it's perfect.'

05:53.291 --> 05:55.000
I'm gonna set up
an after-hours picnic

05:55.000 --> 05:58.375
at the revival movie theater.
My dad knows the owner.

05:58.375 --> 06:01.375
- How barfably adorable.
- You've got something better?

06:01.375 --> 06:04.125
After Jake bids on me,
we're going to the Adams Hotel

06:04.125 --> 06:06.792
for drinks and then up to
a suite for a slumber party.

06:06.792 --> 06:08.375
Ooh.

06:08.375 --> 06:10.458
But what if someone else
ends up buying your date?

06:10.458 --> 06:12.834
You're just gonna take him
to a hotel room?

06:12.834 --> 06:15.500
Depends on how much they bid.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.208
If you expect your boyfriend
to bid on you

06:17.208 --> 06:20.166
you ought to think about
spicing up your date plan.

06:20.166 --> 06:21.708
'Guys can only go
on so many picnics'

06:21.708 --> 06:24.417
before they want
breakfast in bed.

06:24.417 --> 06:27.875
[laughs]
Like you ever had a guy
stick around for breakfast.

06:27.875 --> 06:29.333
[laughs]

06:32.083 --> 06:33.875
(Savannah)
'I want you to know that
you shouldn't feel obligated'

06:33.875 --> 06:36.000
to buy my date at the auction.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.500
I know money is tight,
especially now

06:38.500 --> 06:40.375
that your family is saving
for a wedding.

06:40.375 --> 06:42.417
You're sweet.
You get pie.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.208
And I'm still gonna bid for you.

06:46.208 --> 06:48.125
My brother can pay
for his own mistake.

06:50.208 --> 06:54.333
- You're not happy he's engaged?
- Sure, if it works out.

06:54.333 --> 06:57.708
See, he's one of those guys
who feels like

06:57.708 --> 07:00.917
life is just a timeline of
major events to be ticked off.

07:00.917 --> 07:03.959
He's known this girl long enough
and marriage is the thing

07:03.959 --> 07:06.667
that happens next,
so it's happening.

07:08.417 --> 07:10.875
I don't see what's
so wrong with that.

07:10.875 --> 07:12.625
It's good to make plans
for the future.

07:12.625 --> 07:13.959
Yeah, if you have no interest

07:13.959 --> 07:15.708
in wherever else life
could take you.

07:15.708 --> 07:19.417
Just put those blinders on
and stare at the road.

07:19.417 --> 07:23.250
Forget about the possibility of
a, a detour that could take you

07:23.250 --> 07:26.166
to some really amazing
unexpected destination.

07:28.083 --> 07:29.333
So does that mean
you don't see yourself

07:29.333 --> 07:31.792
getting married someday?

07:31.792 --> 07:34.083
Who knows? I mean,
if it happens, it happens.

07:34.083 --> 07:36.834
I'm certainly not
gonna stress about it now.

07:38.417 --> 07:41.041
Cool.
Yeah, I totally get it.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.625
But you're open to it, right?

07:47.625 --> 07:48.959
Is it an issue?

07:50.959 --> 07:53.333
Well, growing up,
I always figured

07:53.333 --> 07:55.792
I'd wait until I was married
to have sex.

07:57.583 --> 07:59.583
Oh.

07:59.583 --> 08:01.834
Don't look all disappointed.

08:01.834 --> 08:03.250
That was back
when I was living at home

08:03.250 --> 08:05.625
and looked at life
a lot differently.

08:07.458 --> 08:12.625
I can maybe see being
with a guy, the right guy.

08:12.625 --> 08:16.166
But I have to at least know
that there's marriage ahead.

08:16.166 --> 08:19.583
I mean, down the road.
You know, at some point.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.667
If it all worked out, I mean.

08:23.667 --> 08:26.125
- That's fine.
- What part of it is fine?

08:29.375 --> 08:32.750
Sometimes it's hard to tell
what you're thinking.

08:32.750 --> 08:36.667
Marriage, sex, the future,
it's all fine.

08:36.667 --> 08:39.291
Let's just take
one step at a time.

08:39.291 --> 08:41.625
Not worry so much. Yeah?

08:45.375 --> 08:46.708
You know what worries me?

08:49.000 --> 08:50.375
Not knowing there's a plan.

08:52.667 --> 08:54.834
Even if we had a plan

08:54.834 --> 08:57.834
I'd change it
just to keep life interesting.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.667
I bet you think it's cute
when you say things like that.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.708
- Oh, it is.
- Well, it's not.

09:04.708 --> 09:05.834
It is.

09:19.667 --> 09:20.834
[moans]

09:26.708 --> 09:27.875
Oh.

09:32.542 --> 09:34.250
[chuckles]

09:36.667 --> 09:37.875
That was close.

09:37.875 --> 09:39.458
No closer than last night

09:39.458 --> 09:42.083
when your mom almost caught us.

09:42.083 --> 09:43.375
Mmm.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.750
Don't you like the thrill of it?

09:44.750 --> 09:46.417
Hmm? Right?

09:46.417 --> 09:48.917
And the element of danger?

09:48.917 --> 09:50.583
You have to admit
it's kind of fun.

09:50.583 --> 09:54.000
Well, yeah, at first.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.333
But, you know,
this sneakin' around

09:56.333 --> 09:59.375
you know, it can't
last forever, right?

09:59.375 --> 10:03.583
- Uh, right?
- What? Is it so bad?

10:03.583 --> 10:06.417
I mean, living in Cheertown
is like living in a terrarium.

10:06.417 --> 10:08.083
I don't like all the bobbleheads
knowing everything

10:08.083 --> 10:09.417
about my life.

10:09.417 --> 10:11.583
Resistance is futile.

10:11.583 --> 10:14.917
Come on. Didn't you learn
anything being with Alice?

10:14.917 --> 10:16.250
From what people say

10:16.250 --> 10:17.708
it's like you two
had your own reality show.

10:17.708 --> 10:21.208
Uh, a different
situation altogether.

10:21.208 --> 10:24.250
Well, if that was different,
then...

10:24.250 --> 10:25.708
...let's keep
our thing different.

10:25.708 --> 10:26.917
Mmm.

10:31.417 --> 10:33.125
Oh, damn.

10:33.125 --> 10:35.083
Come on. Let's get out of here
before Vanessa sees us.

11:31.375 --> 11:34.041
Thank you so much
for coming out tonight.

11:34.041 --> 11:38.458
It is my pleasure to introduce
to you your Lancer Hellcats

11:38.458 --> 11:40.792
and tell you all about
the fabulous dates

11:40.792 --> 11:42.333
that we have planned.

11:42.333 --> 11:44.333
Each date will start at $50

11:44.333 --> 11:46.375
but I mean, come on,
we all agree

11:46.375 --> 11:49.458
that these talented Hellcats
are worth more than that.

11:49.458 --> 11:50.834
Am I right?

11:50.834 --> 11:52.625
[cheering]

11:52.625 --> 11:56.542
Now we are trying
to raise $5000

11:56.542 --> 11:59.333
so we're hoping that
you'll bid generously

11:59.333 --> 12:01.208
and have a great time
doin' it.

12:01.208 --> 12:04.667
So let the Hellcat
date auction begin.

12:04.667 --> 12:06.834
[cheering]

12:10.875 --> 12:14.500
First up, we have Frankie

12:14.500 --> 12:16.708
'and she wants to take
y'all on a riverboat'

12:16.708 --> 12:19.417
'down the Mississippi.'

12:19.417 --> 12:20.667
'Go, half pint.'

12:24.708 --> 12:27.333
Now we have Darwin.
Ain't he cute?

12:30.417 --> 12:33.625
'I'll know that's you.
What, what?'

12:33.625 --> 12:35.417
'Come on,
here comes red and blondie.'

12:35.417 --> 12:38.500
Yep, double the trouble,
Louise and Jen.

12:52.417 --> 12:54.917
'Oh, here's Lewis, y'all.'

12:54.917 --> 12:58.417
'Yep, and he wants
to work your body.'

12:58.417 --> 13:00.708
'He's offerin' a free
personal training'

13:00.708 --> 13:03.917
'followed by a couple's massage
at a local spa.'

13:03.917 --> 13:05.708
We got $50 in the front.

13:05.708 --> 13:08.750
'Can I get 75?'

13:08.750 --> 13:11.917
Seventy five in the back.
Thank you.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.917
'Can I get a 125?'

13:13.917 --> 13:17.291
Oh, look at you, Lewis.
You are popular tonight.

13:17.291 --> 13:19.250
Can I get a 200?

13:19.250 --> 13:20.792
'Two hundred in the back.'

13:20.792 --> 13:23.125
How 'bout 225?

13:23.125 --> 13:25.959
'Two hundred goin' once,
goin' twice'

13:25.959 --> 13:29.333
and sold to number 62
in the back.

13:33.458 --> 13:35.333
- 'Hey, it's all good.'
- Wow.

13:37.667 --> 13:39.500
Well, that's new.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.583
I always thought
silver foxes were hot.

13:41.583 --> 13:43.458
Right. At least
he has good taste.

13:43.458 --> 13:46.458
(Vanessa)
Okay, here we have Alice

13:46.458 --> 13:48.500
and she wants to take
someone for a drink

13:48.500 --> 13:52.375
at the intimate martini lounge
at the Adams Hotel.

13:53.959 --> 13:55.834
'Can you handle it?'

13:55.834 --> 13:59.667
'Okay, we got $50 from Lancer
quarterback Jake Harrow.'

13:59.667 --> 14:00.667
'Thank you.'

14:00.667 --> 14:02.458
How 'bout 75?

14:02.458 --> 14:04.250
Can I get a 75?
Oh, come on.

14:04.250 --> 14:07.166
'This talented, amazing
co-captain of the Hellcats'

14:07.166 --> 14:11.875
'is a steal at 75.'

14:11.875 --> 14:16.000
Hey, nobody's gonna bid against
Lancer's starting quarterback.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.291
Do something.

14:17.291 --> 14:18.750
Oh, no. You're right.

14:24.375 --> 14:27.125
Uh, okay.
We got a bid at, uh...

14:27.125 --> 14:29.792
- Hundred dollars.
- 'Hundred dollars. Thank you.'

14:33.542 --> 14:38.667
- Three hundred dollars.
- Sold for $300 to number 5.

14:38.667 --> 14:40.708
I'm worth twice as much
as that and he knows it.

14:40.708 --> 14:42.542
I let him off easy.

14:42.542 --> 14:44.208
(Vanessa)
'Oh, listen up, y'all.'

14:44.208 --> 14:46.917
'It's Marti Perkins.'

pre-law student.'

What you know about that?

'Work it out.'

14:55.708 --> 15:00.375
'We have number 38
and number 40.'

15:00.375 --> 15:02.583
- Okay, number 6.
- Confirmed.

15:02.583 --> 15:07.208
- 'Sold to number 6 for $250.'
- What?

15:07.208 --> 15:08.959
Are you serious?

15:12.250 --> 15:14.542
(Vanessa)
'And finally
we our Hellcats captain'

15:14.542 --> 15:17.375
'extraordinaire
Savannah Monroe.'

15:17.375 --> 15:19.625
'Shake your
tail feather, girl.'

15:19.625 --> 15:22.792
Sassy little thing.
And we have our first bid.

15:24.417 --> 15:28.250
'And our second.
We're at 100.'

15:28.250 --> 15:30.792
'One fifty, two hundred.'

15:32.917 --> 15:35.583
- Five hundred dollars.
- 'Oh, my goodness.'

15:35.583 --> 15:37.083
'Five hundred dollars
to the gentleman'

15:37.083 --> 15:38.250
'over here at the front.'

15:38.250 --> 15:40.125
Can I get a 525?

15:44.083 --> 15:45.583
Okay. Well, there we have it.

15:45.583 --> 15:48.708
Savannah's date goes
for $500 to number 18.

15:48.708 --> 15:50.417
'Please see
our university brochure'

15:50.417 --> 15:52.041
'Mr. Dumont right in the front.'

15:52.041 --> 15:54.417
Well, this concludes
our date auction.

15:54.417 --> 15:56.375
Thank you so much
for comin' out tonight.

15:56.375 --> 15:58.000
'supporting our Hellcats.'

16:06.166 --> 16:07.792
Any idea what that
was all about?

16:07.792 --> 16:09.792
That's Noah.

16:09.792 --> 16:11.166
Wait. As in ex-boyfriend Noah?

16:11.166 --> 16:12.500
Mm-hmm.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.333
I didn't know he was
made of money like that.

16:14.333 --> 16:15.917
He's not made of money.

16:15.917 --> 16:17.625
I have a feeling
the unsinkable Layne Monroe

16:17.625 --> 16:18.959
sponsored his appearance.

16:18.959 --> 16:20.834
Why would your mom do that?

16:20.834 --> 16:22.291
I plan to ask her.

16:22.291 --> 16:23.959
Well, you may be goin'
on a date with Noah

16:23.959 --> 16:25.458
but you are comin' home with me.

16:25.458 --> 16:26.750
Mm-mm. Absolutely.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.333
We're still almost $1000 short.

16:32.333 --> 16:34.667
Uh, excuse me, coach Lodge.

16:34.667 --> 16:37.917
Um, I have been contacted
by a proxy bidder

16:37.917 --> 16:40.000
who would like to put in
one final bid.

16:40.000 --> 16:46.166
He is willing to spend
$825 on a date.

16:46.166 --> 16:48.959
But the... All the Hellcats
have dates already.

16:48.959 --> 16:51.792
Yes. Well, this bidder
is hoping to buy a date

16:51.792 --> 16:53.583
with a former Hellcat.

16:55.333 --> 16:57.959
He wants a date with you,
Coach Lodge.

16:57.959 --> 17:00.542
[scoffs]
Who's the bidder?

17:00.542 --> 17:02.417
He insists
on remaining anonymous.

17:02.417 --> 17:05.000
Well, you can
give me a hint, right?

17:05.000 --> 17:06.875
I mean, is it someone I know?

17:06.875 --> 17:10.708
Someone in the athletic
department, perhaps?

17:10.708 --> 17:12.791
It's not Red Raymond, is it?

17:12.791 --> 17:16.375
Why would I tell you,
and spoil all the fun?

17:16.375 --> 17:17.875
Here are the details
of your dates

17:17.875 --> 17:20.416
and if the Hellcats
need that money

17:20.416 --> 17:22.541
all you have to do
is show up.

17:24.666 --> 17:25.875
Wow.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.500
Well, Red is on
a recruiting trip

17:31.500 --> 17:32.834
but I checked his schedule

17:32.834 --> 17:34.417
and he's due back tonight.

17:34.417 --> 17:37.208
Come on, Vanessa.
Anyone could have bid on you.

17:37.208 --> 17:40.792
And listen, even if it was Red,
the Hellcats need you, right?

17:40.792 --> 17:43.250
Be right there!

17:43.250 --> 17:46.500
Sorry, babe, but, uh,
Dr. Herbert's talk is starting.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.542
Go on the date,
I trust you

17:48.542 --> 17:51.250
and I'll see you as soon as
I'm back from Atlanta.

17:51.250 --> 17:53.041
I love you.

17:53.041 --> 17:54.708
Okay.

17:54.708 --> 17:56.291
Love you, too, Derrick.

17:59.041 --> 18:01.458
Another one, coach?

18:01.458 --> 18:03.875
Yes. Something, uh,
stronger this time.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.583
What's wrong?
Date auction didn't go well?

18:06.583 --> 18:08.291
Yeah. We came up
a little short.

18:08.291 --> 18:11.083
That surprises me with all
those pretty girls on display

18:11.083 --> 18:12.750
and, oh, that Lewis. Ho, ho.

18:12.750 --> 18:15.417
Not as surprising as
a last-minute anonymous bid

18:15.417 --> 18:17.250
for the exact amount
that we needed.

18:17.250 --> 18:19.166
Well, then what are you
doin' in here boohooin'?

18:19.166 --> 18:20.583
- That sounds like great news.
- Yeah.

18:20.583 --> 18:22.750
Except that the bid
was for a date with me

18:22.750 --> 18:26.250
and I think
the bidder was Red Raymond.

18:26.250 --> 18:28.792
- It's for the Hellcats, right?
- Mm-hmm.

18:28.792 --> 18:30.458
Your boyfriend will understand.

18:30.458 --> 18:32.875
Yeah, he was a little
too understanding.

18:32.875 --> 18:35.583
I was hoping he'd be
at least a little outraged.

18:35.583 --> 18:37.792
I mean,
even if just for show.

18:37.792 --> 18:40.041
Well, that sounds like
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

18:40.041 --> 18:42.750
My advice, get all gussied up.

18:42.750 --> 18:45.875
Go out for a fabulous meal,
but don't touch it.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.375
If you don't touch it,
it don't count.

18:50.333 --> 18:53.500
Well, that's excellent
advice, Wanda.

18:54.583 --> 18:56.083
Very helpful.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.250
It comes with bein' a mom.

19:01.458 --> 19:03.750
(Layne)
'A pleasure as always, ladies.'

19:03.750 --> 19:05.125
Nicely done.

19:05.125 --> 19:07.125
- Now you all have your handout?
- Yes, we do.

19:07.125 --> 19:09.166
Because we have
a lot of reading to do.

19:09.166 --> 19:10.417
[laughs]

19:12.125 --> 19:14.125
Savannah, what brings you here?

19:15.583 --> 19:16.959
Wanna do this
in front of them?

19:19.041 --> 19:21.500
So, Annie, we are
at your house next week.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.083
Thank you again, everybody.

19:23.083 --> 19:24.792
- Do drive carefully.
- Bye. Thank you.

19:24.792 --> 19:26.667
Bye-bye now.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.291
[sighs]

19:30.291 --> 19:31.667
Noah Campbell showed up
at the Hellcats

19:31.667 --> 19:33.792
date auction last night.

19:33.792 --> 19:35.458
Know anything about it?

19:35.458 --> 19:37.917
Noah's a very nice boy.
You should be flattered.

19:39.375 --> 19:42.500
No. No, I'm confused, mom.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.000
Okay, the last time I was here

19:44.000 --> 19:45.500
you didn't want anything
more to do with me

19:45.500 --> 19:47.750
and now you're butting
right back into my life.

19:47.750 --> 19:51.000
Things are said in anger
that we don't really mean.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.375
No matter what, I will
never give up on you.

19:53.375 --> 19:55.375
This isn't about me.

19:55.375 --> 19:57.959
It's about your reputation
and the church.

19:57.959 --> 19:59.667
If your rogue daughter
reunites with her

19:59.667 --> 20:02.500
upstanding ex-boyfriend,
the minister's son, no less

20:02.500 --> 20:04.000
then maybe
your Bible study group

20:04.000 --> 20:06.458
will stop whispering
behind your back.

20:06.458 --> 20:09.708
My friends and I talk
very openly about the pain

20:09.708 --> 20:12.166
your absence causes this family.

20:15.708 --> 20:18.083
Well, your plan
isn't going to work.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.542
But I'm still
showing up on the date.

20:20.542 --> 20:22.959
The Hellcats appreciate
your generous donation.

20:24.542 --> 20:26.375
You be kind to Noah.

20:26.375 --> 20:28.625
You've already broken
his heart once.

20:31.375 --> 20:34.667
Good to know you care so much
about everyone else but me.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.875
No. No, um, d-don't apologize.
I appreciate you trying to help.

20:45.875 --> 20:47.291
'Thanks.'

20:48.708 --> 20:51.041
Hey, something wrong?

20:51.041 --> 20:52.750
I just got off
with the last homeless shelter

20:52.750 --> 20:54.417
left to call that might have
information

20:54.417 --> 20:55.917
on Travis' ex-girlfriend.

20:56.500 --> 20:57.959
Nothing.

20:57.959 --> 20:59.917
Ah, you're gonna find her.

21:18.583 --> 21:19.959
(Alice)
'Marti.'

21:19.959 --> 21:21.917
- Oh.
- Um, hey.

21:21.917 --> 21:24.750
I was just telling, Lewis, how
excited I am about sectionals.

21:24.750 --> 21:25.792
- Yeah.
- Yay.

21:25.792 --> 21:27.750
- Yay.
- Yay.

21:27.750 --> 21:29.917
Whatever. Savannah wants you
in the common room.

21:35.667 --> 21:37.291
That would have been a disaster.

21:40.083 --> 21:43.000
Is there more goin' on here
than you're tellin' me?

21:43.000 --> 21:44.959
No, of course not.

21:44.959 --> 21:48.667
I'm just saying it's still early
and I think we should find out

21:48.667 --> 21:52.250
if this really works before
we let everyone in on it.

21:52.250 --> 21:55.000
And once it becomes part
of the group, it's, uh...

21:55.000 --> 21:57.542
Gets a lot harder
to back out. Right.

21:59.500 --> 22:02.417
It's just the second
we talk about us out loud

22:02.417 --> 22:03.583
the relationship becomes real.

22:05.291 --> 22:07.166
Well, hey, if you're gettin'
cold feet

22:07.166 --> 22:09.125
now's the time to let me know.

22:09.125 --> 22:10.417
Hmm?

22:10.417 --> 22:11.583
No harm, no foul.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.667
So what do you wanna do?

22:15.667 --> 22:17.542
(Savannah)
'Marti!'

22:19.500 --> 22:23.125
Marti, can I get some help
out here please?

22:23.125 --> 22:25.041
Let me get back to you on that.

22:25.041 --> 22:27.875
(Savannah)
'Marti, I would love some help!'

22:39.208 --> 22:42.625
- Which one?
- What are you doing?

22:42.625 --> 22:44.166
Getting ready for my date.

22:44.166 --> 22:46.166
Okay, but what are you
really doing?

22:46.166 --> 22:47.792
Teaching my mother a lesson.

22:47.792 --> 22:49.667
I want Noah to be so shocked
that he runs home

22:49.667 --> 22:52.583
to his preacher daddy and tells
him what a bad girl I am now.

22:54.041 --> 22:57.208
Why would you want that?
Am I missing something?

22:57.208 --> 22:58.667
Gossip that good
makes it through

22:58.667 --> 23:00.583
the church grapevine in no time.

23:00.583 --> 23:03.500
My mother is gonna be mortified.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.417
Okay, have you
thought this through?

23:05.417 --> 23:06.917
I think everything through.

23:08.917 --> 23:11.875
Look, if you still have hope
of reconnecting with your family

23:11.875 --> 23:14.375
'this is only going to
push you farther apart.'

23:14.375 --> 23:16.375
Trust me, I've tried
everything with Wanda

23:16.375 --> 23:18.792
and hostility
doesn't heal anything.

23:20.708 --> 23:22.542
[doorbell rings]

23:29.208 --> 23:31.333
Look, it's, it's not too late.

23:31.333 --> 23:33.166
I can stall him
if you wanna go change.

23:48.250 --> 23:50.917
Noah. How the hell are you?

24:05.208 --> 24:08.041
So...

24:08.041 --> 24:09.917
This is nice.

24:09.917 --> 24:12.166
Romantic.

24:12.166 --> 24:13.417
If you think I was serious

24:13.417 --> 24:15.917
when I planned a picnic
at a movie theater

24:15.917 --> 24:19.458
it goes to show how little
you know me anymore.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.000
Look at this movie.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.250
Totally ironic.

24:25.291 --> 24:26.792
Yeah.

24:26.792 --> 24:29.291
Basically, I'm really
into irony these days.

24:29.291 --> 24:31.333
Romantic dates like this
are ridiculous

24:31.333 --> 24:34.208
and only sad sacks
fall for them.

24:37.583 --> 24:39.125
(Morgan)
'Should we have another?'

24:41.291 --> 24:43.083
Uh, bring one more for the lady.

24:43.083 --> 24:45.500
Look, Morgan, I-I appreciate
the chivalry and all

24:45.500 --> 24:47.166
but can we just get to it?

24:47.166 --> 24:50.125
I know you brought me here
to talk about Travis.

24:50.125 --> 24:53.125
You think it's all work,
work, work with me.

24:53.125 --> 24:55.667
Is it so crazy that
I might have feelings for you?

24:57.959 --> 25:00.000
Are you serious?

25:02.500 --> 25:04.458
- Okay.
- Please.

25:04.458 --> 25:05.875
Don't flatter yourself.

25:05.875 --> 25:07.500
You're right
on one count though.

25:07.500 --> 25:10.208
I figured I'd get you drunk,
get you talking.

25:10.208 --> 25:12.625
If you found a way to be a hero
in our law clinic

25:12.625 --> 25:15.792
I want you to cut me in.
Share the wealth.

25:15.792 --> 25:18.708
For an ambitious person
to another.

25:18.708 --> 25:20.834
I can help you, Marti.

25:20.834 --> 25:22.375
- I'm a hard worker.
- Mm-hmm.

25:22.375 --> 25:25.333
I'm great with people.

25:25.333 --> 25:27.542
And you'd have access
to my brilliant legal mind.

25:28.959 --> 25:30.708
Even if I tell you,
you won't be interested.

25:30.708 --> 25:33.250
You've made it clear you don't
care if Travis is innocent.

25:33.250 --> 25:35.625
You found something
that proves his innocence?

25:35.625 --> 25:37.750
Please. I swear
I won't tell Julian.

25:39.333 --> 25:42.000
What if I can actually
help you help Travis?

25:42.000 --> 25:43.291
Wouldn't that be worth the risk?

25:45.542 --> 25:46.542
What do you know?

25:49.000 --> 25:51.917
I know nothing.
That's the problem.

25:51.917 --> 25:53.834
I've spent the last few weeks
searching everywhere

25:53.834 --> 25:55.834
for this Jane Loomis.

25:55.834 --> 25:58.708
I remember her from the
deposition. The homeless woman.

25:58.708 --> 26:00.875
That's right.

26:00.875 --> 26:02.792
They were living together on
the streets when he was arrested

26:02.792 --> 26:04.875
and she was his alibi.

26:04.875 --> 26:06.375
By the time the trial
rolled around

26:06.375 --> 26:08.750
she'd changed her story.

26:08.750 --> 26:10.208
So you got nothin'?

26:10.208 --> 26:13.041
Homeless people are hard
to keep track of.

26:13.041 --> 26:16.166
Looks like you spent
$250 on nothin'. Mm.

26:16.166 --> 26:17.375
Eh.

26:18.708 --> 26:20.166
It was an old check
for an account

26:20.166 --> 26:22.542
that I closed two years ago.

26:22.542 --> 26:24.708
It'll bounce like a superball.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.583
I'm sorry.
You wrote a bad check?

26:26.583 --> 26:27.959
Yeah.

26:29.792 --> 26:31.959
Well, I'm not gonna pay
to watch you eat.

26:33.792 --> 26:36.750
These drinks are most
definitely on you then.

26:36.750 --> 26:38.500
Thanks, buddy.

26:51.375 --> 26:55.250
Want some?
It's straight tequila.

26:55.250 --> 26:57.083
No, none for me. Thanks.

27:02.083 --> 27:04.500
Don't let me stop you.
Drink up.

27:08.166 --> 27:11.834
Come on, boots.
I know this is all an act.

27:11.834 --> 27:14.291
No, it's not. It's the new me.

27:19.625 --> 27:21.250
What gave me away?

27:21.250 --> 27:23.083
There's a reason why
you were always cast as a tree

27:23.083 --> 27:26.166
in the Sunday school
theater productions.

27:26.166 --> 27:28.125
You're not a good actor.

27:28.125 --> 27:29.792
You always told me I was great.

27:29.792 --> 27:33.750
I liked you even way back then.

27:33.750 --> 27:35.417
Do you know how much bending
is involved

27:35.417 --> 27:37.750
while playing a weeping willow?

27:37.750 --> 27:38.834
I can imagine.

27:42.250 --> 27:45.417
Look, I know my mother
was behind this date.

27:45.417 --> 27:46.708
The dress, the alcohol...

27:48.417 --> 27:51.166
- I did it to get back at her.
- Seriously?

27:51.166 --> 27:54.959
We've been fighting for months
about my life at Lancer

27:54.959 --> 27:56.500
and I know she sent you
to the date auction

27:56.500 --> 27:59.792
hoping you'd talk sense into me.

27:59.792 --> 28:03.166
Look, you can think of Layne
as an evil villainess

28:03.166 --> 28:06.875
all you want,
but when she came to me

28:06.875 --> 28:09.250
all I saw was a worried mom.

28:09.250 --> 28:12.125
Well, she doesn't need to worry.

28:12.125 --> 28:14.625
I've met great new people
and I've done things in my life

28:14.625 --> 28:17.000
that have totally
expanded the way I think.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.333
But because I'm outside
of her bubble of control

28:21.333 --> 28:24.250
because I'm free,
she rejects it all.

28:25.708 --> 28:27.708
What's it like?

28:27.708 --> 28:30.417
Being so unrestricted.

28:33.500 --> 28:37.708
Sometimes, I don't know
what I'm doing

28:37.708 --> 28:40.875
and I feel like a step behind.

28:40.875 --> 28:43.250
Like people are laughing at me
because I don't get the joke.

28:44.667 --> 28:47.542
It can be a big, scary mess.

28:47.542 --> 28:49.834
But I do it.

28:49.834 --> 28:51.834
There's the honesty
I was waiting for.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.708
It's weird.

28:55.708 --> 28:59.583
When I sit next to you,
I feel like I could say anything

28:59.583 --> 29:02.375
'cause you already know
everything about me.

29:02.375 --> 29:04.333
We do go back a long way, so...

29:06.917 --> 29:09.458
Well, here's to old friends.

29:25.125 --> 29:27.625
Uh, it's you?

29:30.208 --> 29:31.917
You're my date?

29:33.500 --> 29:35.125
Surprise.

29:36.583 --> 29:38.542
But how?

29:38.542 --> 29:41.375
- Why didn't you...
- Early flight home.

29:41.375 --> 29:43.542
And listen, I knew that
if I didn't keep my identity

29:43.542 --> 29:45.417
a secret that you would
never allow me to spend

29:45.417 --> 29:47.667
this kind of money
on the Hellcats.

29:47.667 --> 29:49.583
You're right about that.

29:51.166 --> 29:54.750
So it was an easy decision,
Vanessa.

29:54.750 --> 29:58.333
My promotion may take me away
from you a little bit more

29:58.333 --> 30:00.625
but it also came
with a salary bump

30:00.625 --> 30:03.291
and I can't think of anything
better to spend the money on.

30:03.291 --> 30:06.333
Hmm. Not even that flat screen
at Gilday's?

30:06.333 --> 30:08.667
Okay, how did you know,
I had my eye on that?

30:08.667 --> 30:11.125
Baby, I have to wipe
the drool off your face

30:11.125 --> 30:13.500
every time we pass that window.

30:13.500 --> 30:16.875
Yeah, well,
flat screens come and go

30:16.875 --> 30:18.500
but I plan on staring
at you for years.

30:22.625 --> 30:26.625
Oh, my God. Look at me.
I'm a mess. I'm so embarrassed.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.125
Yeah, good thing you didn't
show up to our first date

30:28.125 --> 30:29.625
dressed like this.

30:29.625 --> 30:31.625
Well, you know,
in protesting Red's date

30:31.625 --> 30:33.834
I ran 6 miles
without showering so, yeah

30:33.834 --> 30:36.708
I must smell awful.

30:36.708 --> 30:39.667
You...

30:39.667 --> 30:43.959
...actually did work up
a serious funk, Vanessa. Wow.

30:43.959 --> 30:46.166
Now do you really think
Red Raymond could pull off

30:46.166 --> 30:49.333
something as cool as this?

30:49.333 --> 30:51.417
Not in a million years.

31:04.667 --> 31:05.959
Oh.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.667
I thought tonight
was gonna be awful.

31:09.667 --> 31:12.000
But it turned out
to be really nice.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.875
Thanks, I think.

31:13.875 --> 31:15.792
You know what I mean.

31:15.792 --> 31:19.041
Yeah, it has been really nice.

31:19.041 --> 31:21.834
Could be again.

31:21.834 --> 31:24.208
Noah, this isn't a real date.

31:24.208 --> 31:26.500
What about the connection
we have?

31:26.500 --> 31:28.041
We've always had?

31:28.041 --> 31:31.375
Don't tell me
you don't still feel it.

31:31.375 --> 31:34.083
- I have a boyfriend now.
- Yeah, I know.

31:35.667 --> 31:37.708
Bad-boy type, right?

31:37.708 --> 31:40.750
All exciting. Has game.

31:40.750 --> 31:42.875
You know what we squares have?

31:42.875 --> 31:45.000
- What?
- Stability.

31:48.708 --> 31:51.000
If we got back together

31:51.000 --> 31:53.375
I see us dating
for about a year or so.

31:53.375 --> 31:56.041
And when we finish school,
we'd get engaged.

31:58.667 --> 32:00.750
A year to plan the wedding
because we both wanna

32:00.750 --> 32:03.708
do it right.

32:03.708 --> 32:05.166
Then kids.

32:06.458 --> 32:09.000
I wanna grow old
with you, boots.

32:12.208 --> 32:14.417
I don't know
what to say to that.

32:14.417 --> 32:16.333
You don't have to say
anything right now.

32:17.792 --> 32:20.083
You know exactly
where you can find me.

32:24.917 --> 32:26.875
So you drag me out of bed
on a Sunday morning.

32:26.875 --> 32:28.625
Take me to a strange part
of town.

32:28.625 --> 32:30.417
And you won't tell me
what we're doing?

32:30.417 --> 32:31.750
- No.
- Wow.

32:31.750 --> 32:32.917
Where's your white panel van

32:32.917 --> 32:34.750
with the onboard manacles?

32:34.750 --> 32:36.542
You know, you should think
before you crack wise.

32:36.542 --> 32:37.750
Oh.

32:37.750 --> 32:38.708
Ta-da.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.542
Pretty nice neighborhood
for someone

32:41.542 --> 32:42.917
that was homeless for so long.

32:44.500 --> 32:45.792
Jane Loomis?

32:45.792 --> 32:47.625
- Mm-hmm.
- How'd you find her?

32:47.625 --> 32:49.125
I went down to Social Services

32:49.125 --> 32:51.458
with a tray of lattes
and pumpkin muffins.

32:51.458 --> 32:54.458
Walked out with a forwarding
address here in Memphis.

32:54.458 --> 32:55.959
That worked?

32:55.959 --> 32:58.250
Honestly, I'm as surprised
as you are.

32:58.250 --> 33:00.750
[doorbell rings]

33:00.750 --> 33:02.625
- Yes?
- Good morning, Miss Loomis.

33:02.625 --> 33:03.667
My name is Morgan Pepper.

33:03.667 --> 33:05.291
- This is Marti Perkins.
- Hi.

33:05.291 --> 33:07.291
We're students
at Lancer University.

33:07.291 --> 33:08.333
We were hoping
you could help us out

33:08.333 --> 33:09.417
with a project we're working on.

33:09.417 --> 33:10.834
Why, of course.

33:10.834 --> 33:13.625
I, uh, saw some hard times
over the years

33:13.625 --> 33:15.500
and Lancer students
helped me out a lot.

33:15.500 --> 33:16.792
Well, we'd like to
talk to you about

33:16.792 --> 33:20.250
your ex-boyfriend
Travis Guthrie.

33:20.250 --> 33:22.166
Our law clinic is looking
into his robbery conviction

33:22.166 --> 33:24.500
and we found some discrepancies
in witness reports

33:24.500 --> 33:26.333
surrounding his arrest.

33:26.333 --> 33:29.375
I already told the police
and the prosecutor's office

33:29.375 --> 33:31.375
everything I know about
Travis' case, so...

33:32.792 --> 33:34.041
What about his alibi?
He said that--

33:34.041 --> 33:36.834
I really have
nothing more to add.

33:36.834 --> 33:38.250
Thank you.

33:41.500 --> 33:44.291
Okay. That was suspicious.

33:44.291 --> 33:46.917
We need to look into Jane.
Her background, this house.

33:46.917 --> 33:49.166
Are you saying you want me
in on this with you?

33:49.166 --> 33:50.667
Only if you pay every penny
of that bad check

33:50.667 --> 33:52.291
back to the Hellcats.

33:52.291 --> 33:54.166
That's a non-starter.

33:54.166 --> 33:56.125
I'll pay you ten cents
on the dollar.

33:56.125 --> 33:57.500
What? No way.

33:57.500 --> 33:59.125
I'll maybe let you get away
with 75 cents

33:59.125 --> 34:00.250
on the dollar and that's it.

34:00.250 --> 34:01.750
Fifty cents on the dollar

34:01.750 --> 34:03.834
and you pick up the bar tab
from last night.

34:03.834 --> 34:06.041
- I only had a smart drink.
- And it didn't work.

34:06.041 --> 34:07.708
I outsmarted you.

34:07.708 --> 34:09.208
- Sixty cents.
- Fifty five.

34:09.208 --> 34:10.625
Fifty nine and you never
step foot in my dorm again.

34:11.542 --> 34:13.458
[cell phone rings]

34:22.708 --> 34:24.333
You survived your date
last night?

34:27.208 --> 34:29.166
Noah wants to get back together.

34:29.166 --> 34:31.000
Yeah, I bet, one look
at those perky freddies

34:31.000 --> 34:32.166
all pushed up like that--

34:32.166 --> 34:33.708
Marti, this is serious.

34:33.708 --> 34:35.958
Oh. It is? Why?

34:38.083 --> 34:40.166
You're not considering, are you?

34:42.375 --> 34:44.041
When he and I were dating,
everything was simple.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.917
He knew what he wanted
his life to look like

34:47.917 --> 34:50.083
and I thought I wanted
the same things.

34:50.083 --> 34:52.917
And you're thinking you might
want something else now.

34:52.917 --> 34:55.958
Thinking, stressing,
you name it.

34:55.958 --> 34:58.375
'My whole life, I've been told
that if I didn't find a boy'

34:58.375 --> 35:00.333
get married, save myself
for my wedding night

35:00.333 --> 35:03.583
have kids right away,
blah blah blah blah

35:03.583 --> 35:05.125
it would change the way
that God looked at me.

35:06.959 --> 35:08.333
It would make me a bad person.

35:10.125 --> 35:12.959
And Noah reminds you of how easy
all those rules make everything.

35:12.959 --> 35:14.333
Exactly.

35:15.750 --> 35:17.959
I've been putting so
much pressure on myself

35:17.959 --> 35:19.750
being the free spirit
that Dan wants

35:19.750 --> 35:22.583
that the thought of

35:22.583 --> 35:25.083
knowing what to expect
with Noah is tempting.

35:25.083 --> 35:27.208
New relationships
are always scary.

35:28.834 --> 35:30.083
Morgan.

35:32.959 --> 35:34.959
I'm talking about Lewis.

35:36.959 --> 35:39.625
You guys are together?

35:39.625 --> 35:41.750
At the moment,
I'm, I'm not sure.

35:41.750 --> 35:44.625
No way. I can't believe
you haven't told me.

35:44.625 --> 35:46.166
I've wanted to keep things quiet
until we know

35:46.166 --> 35:47.959
where the relationship is going.

35:47.959 --> 35:49.625
I totally knew
he had the hots for you.

35:49.625 --> 35:51.333
Hey, will you stop making
such a big deal about it?

35:51.333 --> 35:52.708
Okay, okay.

35:53.667 --> 35:55.083
So what's the problem?

35:57.333 --> 35:59.083
Lewis...

36:02.166 --> 36:04.166
I don't know.

36:04.166 --> 36:06.917
He's got a problem
with keeping us a secret.

36:06.917 --> 36:08.417
'I mean, do we need
to go around flaunting'

36:08.417 --> 36:10.667
our relationship to everyone?

36:10.667 --> 36:12.834
That's not normal.

36:12.834 --> 36:16.166
Wow.
You're really scared of love.

36:16.166 --> 36:19.500
Hey, who said anything about
love? I am nowhere near love.

36:19.500 --> 36:21.625
See? Scared.

36:24.291 --> 36:26.041
And what about you?

36:27.708 --> 36:31.291
I'm scared of the unknown
and that's Dan.

36:33.375 --> 36:35.417
We need to not be scared.

36:35.417 --> 36:37.458
I don't think it works that way.

36:37.458 --> 36:38.834
Change is scary.

36:38.834 --> 36:40.542
Anything different is scary.

36:40.542 --> 36:42.667
Going to kindergarten
for the first time

36:42.667 --> 36:45.333
and graduating high school,
leaving home

36:45.333 --> 36:47.417
all those things terrified me
when I did 'em.

36:48.625 --> 36:50.083
But you did them.

36:50.083 --> 36:51.750
Yeah. You have to.

36:51.750 --> 36:53.583
Otherwise you get stuck
in the same spot forever.

36:54.750 --> 36:56.375
And that would be scary.

36:58.208 --> 36:59.625
You can handle this.

37:01.542 --> 37:03.041
We can handle this.

37:05.542 --> 37:07.375
Lewis.

37:14.166 --> 37:15.583
Charlotte?

37:21.333 --> 37:23.875
And I was counting
on a peaceful afternoon.

37:23.875 --> 37:26.125
I'm not here to fight, mom.
I just want to talk.

37:26.125 --> 37:28.250
I've heard that before.

37:28.250 --> 37:30.500
Mom, please.

37:30.500 --> 37:32.125
[sighs]
Come on.

37:36.083 --> 37:38.083
So I went on my date
with Noah last night.

37:38.083 --> 37:41.583
And was it as awful
as you thought it would be?

37:42.750 --> 37:43.959
No.

37:46.625 --> 37:49.417
Do you have any idea
how hard it has been for me

37:49.417 --> 37:50.917
to leave my old life behind?

37:50.917 --> 37:52.750
How would I know that, Savannah?

37:52.750 --> 37:54.583
Every time I try to talk to you

37:54.583 --> 37:56.917
you have such walls up
around your choices.

37:58.375 --> 38:01.875
Fine. Five minutes, no wall.

38:04.583 --> 38:06.917
What were you hoping to get out
of setting me and Noah up again?

38:10.917 --> 38:14.291
Noah has always been a very
popular, inquisitive boy

38:14.291 --> 38:18.125
who also understands
that God has a plan for him

38:18.125 --> 38:21.000
and he is gonna follow it
step by step.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.500
And if I can't be that

38:22.500 --> 38:24.417
at least I could be
with someone like that.

38:25.792 --> 38:27.834
Well, when you put
it that way, yes.

38:28.959 --> 38:31.083
I think it would be good for you

38:31.083 --> 38:33.834
to show you you can be
whomever you wanna be

38:33.834 --> 38:35.333
and still walk with God.

38:35.333 --> 38:37.083
Right.

38:37.083 --> 38:38.959
Footprints in the sand
and all that.

38:38.959 --> 38:40.667
You said no wall.

38:42.625 --> 38:45.291
I'm sorry.

38:45.291 --> 38:48.125
God simply wants us
to have joyful, carefree lives

38:48.125 --> 38:51.625
and he gives us a very clear
path to happiness.

38:51.625 --> 38:54.750
But I am happy, mom.

38:54.750 --> 38:58.333
My path might be more winding
than you would choose for me.

38:58.333 --> 39:01.458
And yes, it's scary sometimes.

39:02.959 --> 39:06.166
But no matter what,
I truly believe

39:06.166 --> 39:08.250
I'm gonna end up
in the perfect place for me.

39:11.291 --> 39:12.583
Okay.

39:14.166 --> 39:18.333
So when you go down that road

39:18.333 --> 39:21.708
and if you end up
getting lost...

39:21.708 --> 39:24.250
...just promise me
you'll come home.

39:29.208 --> 39:30.583
Come here, baby.

39:32.000 --> 39:33.333
Oh.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.291
Give me a hand with these.

39:49.500 --> 39:53.417
- You must be exhausted.
- Yeah, it was a long night.

39:53.417 --> 39:57.250
(Lewis)
Long night.
That's fantastic, really.

39:59.667 --> 40:01.500
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:01.500 --> 40:04.458
So, um, yeah,
Lewis and I are dating.

40:05.375 --> 40:06.542
Oh.

40:11.708 --> 40:13.500
That was anticlimactic.

40:13.500 --> 40:15.667
(Alice)
Don't get too attached, Marti.

40:15.667 --> 40:18.959
He's really not
relationship material.

40:18.959 --> 40:22.041
Yeah, well, neither am I,
so it's gonna be awesome.

40:22.041 --> 40:24.291

after the date with Noah.

40:46.542 --> 40:49.041
I needed time to think.

Should I be worried?

40:51.417 --> 40:53.542
Not at all.

40:53.542 --> 40:57.750
