00:09.110 --> 00:10.610
<i>Previously on Frasier...</i>

00:10.900 --> 00:12.600
What is going on?

00:12.790 --> 00:14.974
Oh, our beloved
station manager decided...

00:15.009 --> 00:16.390
...we're not getting
our raise this year!

00:16.680 --> 00:19.980
-You intractable despot!
-Ass! -Shrew!

00:22.380 --> 00:24.477
...you know, you were in
the middle of a negotiation.

00:24.512 --> 00:27.080
Maybe she laid that smackeroo
on you just to rattle your brain.

00:27.210 --> 00:30.010
...we have got to settle
this strike! Alright.

00:30.190 --> 00:32.354
Those people deserve
a five percent raise.

00:32.389 --> 00:33.890
-I'll give you three.
-Four! -Done.

00:42.680 --> 00:46.180
-Frasier! -Damn, I didn't
think you'd be here...

00:46.310 --> 00:47.799
Well, I would've gone
to my regular haunt...

00:47.834 --> 00:50.710
...but "The Pig 'N Swig" is
closed for remodelling.

00:50.840 --> 00:53.367
I'm sorry, Niles, it's just...
I'm meeting Kate here.

00:53.402 --> 00:55.940
We want to discuss the little dilemma
in which we find ourselves.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.142
If you're talking about
the little kiss you two shared...

00:58.177 --> 00:59.720
...that hardly constitutes a dilemma.

00:59.900 --> 01:03.700
-It's not as if you plunged
into a tawdry office affair. -No.

01:03.880 --> 01:08.580
-Then you'd have a real problem.
-Yes. -A kiss? It's nothing. -Right.

01:08.940 --> 01:12.440
Had sex with her, didn't you?

01:12.810 --> 01:16.310
I didn't mean to!
It just... happened!

01:16.520 --> 01:17.759
One minute we were negotiating...

01:17.794 --> 01:19.820
...the next minute our
inhibitions were shattered...

01:20.020 --> 01:23.520
...along with my kneecap
and her Macintosh PowerBook.

01:24.520 --> 01:28.520
-This happened in her office?
-Yes. -What are you saying?

01:28.710 --> 01:32.810
-Her couch folds out?
-We used her desk.

01:33.400 --> 01:36.700
-Her desk folds out?!
-There she is!

01:36.850 --> 01:38.486
Look, look, just make
an excuse and go, okay?

01:38.521 --> 01:41.150
-Alright, okay. Ah, Miss Costas.
-Dr. Crane.

01:41.420 --> 01:45.720
Oh, look at the time! I, er, have a
session with my multiple personality.

01:46.610 --> 01:50.610
Well, not to worry. If I'm late he
can just talk amongst himself.

01:52.520 --> 01:55.420
-So... good morning.
-Good morning.

01:55.610 --> 01:59.640
-How's your knee?
-Ah. Well er, it's better, thanks.

01:59.675 --> 02:02.010
And... and your laptop?

02:02.900 --> 02:05.300
I refer to your computer.

02:05.530 --> 02:09.430
A little dented,
but fine. The computer.

02:10.310 --> 02:12.610
Ah. Anyway, what I wanted
to tell you was that...

02:12.770 --> 02:14.136
...well, last night was...

02:14.171 --> 02:17.370
...one of the greatest nights
of lovemaking I've had since...

02:17.570 --> 02:20.870
-Roz!
-Tell me she just walked in.

02:21.530 --> 02:25.030
Well, hi! Guess you guys
kissed and made up, huh?

02:27.120 --> 02:29.320
Well, in a manner
of speaking, yes.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.792
We were just discussing
the step system...

02:31.827 --> 02:33.920
...in a new healthcare plans
co-payment scheme and...

02:34.070 --> 02:37.370
-...well, it wouldn't interest you.
-Oh, the hell it wouldn't!

02:37.550 --> 02:40.850
You know they're too cheap
to pay for a butt-lift?

02:41.050 --> 02:44.350
I sit on this thing all day
long, that's work-related!

02:45.930 --> 02:47.333
Listen, I really have to go.

02:47.368 --> 02:50.530
But I would like to discuss this matter
at the first possible opportunity.

02:50.730 --> 02:52.730
So would I.

02:53.140 --> 02:57.640
I almost forgot. I need you two to
fill in the eight-to-ten slot tonight.

02:57.820 --> 03:01.420
Floyd, the Happy Chef,
is in rehab again.

03:02.630 --> 03:04.893
Oh, great. I was supposed
to have dinner...

03:04.928 --> 03:06.930
...with a successful, handsome doctor!

03:07.150 --> 03:10.250
She thinks we're all as happy
to work all night as she is.

03:10.410 --> 03:14.310
Well, you're a psychiatrist, Frasier.
She's a cold, repressed workaholic...

03:14.550 --> 03:18.150
...who has no sex life
whatsoever. Can't you help her?

03:20.750 --> 03:23.250
I've tried, Roz.

03:28.920 --> 03:32.220
Why do we bother having
a service elevator?

03:32.520 --> 03:34.012
I just rode up nineteen floors...

03:34.047 --> 03:36.520
...with two sweaty moving
men munching on chili-dogs...

03:36.640 --> 03:39.922
...which they proceeded
to drip onto my suede shoes.

03:39.957 --> 03:41.640
How will I ever get that stain out?

03:47.620 --> 03:49.620
Ah, yes.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.520
Dog saliva!

03:53.030 --> 03:56.030
Nature's miracle solvent.

03:58.420 --> 03:59.522
So who's moving out anyway?

03:59.557 --> 04:02.720
Deirdre Sauvage, the one who
writes the romance novels.

04:02.920 --> 04:05.920
Yeah, the lost Gabor sister's
finally outta here.

04:06.340 --> 04:08.840
Well, she's a very sweet person
and I'm going to miss her.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.240
Well, you're not the one she's
always undressing with her eyes.

04:12.450 --> 04:15.850
She lured me into her apartment
one time, supposedly to fix a lamp.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.671
Next thing I know,
I got a drink in my hand...

04:17.706 --> 04:21.190
...and she's reading me a
dirty poem about meadow walks.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.441
Well, I must admit she's
never done that to me.

04:24.476 --> 04:27.240
Yeah well, if she does, don't fake
a charley horse to get outta there.

04:27.440 --> 04:30.440
She'll just try to rub it!

04:32.760 --> 04:36.660
Speaking of romance, Dr. Crane... when
I washed your shirt this morning...

04:36.840 --> 04:40.440
I couldn't help noticing lipstick
in the oddest places.

04:40.630 --> 04:43.930
I'll take it negotiations
went well last night...?

04:45.260 --> 04:47.760
-I'd rather not discuss it, thank you.
-Why, is there a problem?

04:47.950 --> 04:50.950
Things between me and Kate just went
a little faster than I intended.

04:51.060 --> 04:53.078
I'll say! There were also
four buttons missing...

04:53.113 --> 04:55.360
...and teeth-marks in the shoulders!

04:56.440 --> 04:59.240
Thank you, Inspector Moon!

05:01.660 --> 05:03.860
Things got a little out of hand.

05:04.060 --> 05:05.939
I think we should
slow down a bit but er...

05:05.974 --> 05:08.660
I'm afraid to tell her for
fear of hurting her feelings.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.204
Daphne, how about
a woman's perspective?

05:10.239 --> 05:12.450
Let's just say, for argument's sake,
that you and I succumbed to a...

05:12.580 --> 05:15.280
...a night of passion...

05:17.040 --> 05:19.440
-What, you and me?
-Yes...

05:19.670 --> 05:23.208
What - bosoms heaving, shirt
buttons catapulting through the air?

05:23.243 --> 05:25.170
It's a hypothetical question!

05:25.360 --> 05:29.960
-I'll say it is! -Oh, alright,
somebody else! Alright?

05:30.150 --> 05:32.736
So, you have a, a mad tryst
with this young man...

05:32.771 --> 05:34.850
...and then the next day
he says that...

05:34.970 --> 05:37.017
...he thinks things are going too fast.

05:37.052 --> 05:39.170
He'd like to slow down.
What would you say?

05:39.380 --> 05:42.125
I suppose I'd say,
"Thanks for being honest.

05:42.160 --> 05:45.280
You're probably right,
we were moving too fast."

05:45.860 --> 05:49.560
"Not that it was too fast
for you last night.

05:49.780 --> 05:52.780
Ohh, no, we were right on
schedule then, weren't we?"

05:52.960 --> 05:55.592
"But, now you've had your fun -
though not too much, apparently...

05:55.627 --> 05:56.660
...and you want to be my friend.

05:56.790 --> 06:00.390
Well you can just sod off,
Trevor Mulgrew!!!"

06:03.380 --> 06:07.180
You know, I think I might have
some buttons for this shirt...

06:07.750 --> 06:10.434
You see, dad -
the whole thing's a minefield.

06:10.469 --> 06:11.850
Ah, you'll never learn, will you?

06:12.050 --> 06:14.350
Handling a woman's easy!

06:14.970 --> 06:16.110
You know, you kill me.

06:16.145 --> 06:19.850
Mister Psychiatrist, you've always
gotta make everything so complicated.

06:20.060 --> 06:22.003
A woman comes on too
strong, you just tell her...

06:22.038 --> 06:24.460
...to cool her engines! It's the
easiest thing in the world.

06:25.360 --> 06:29.860
-Oh, Deirdre! -I understand you're
leaving us. -Alas, yes! Oh, do come in!

06:30.070 --> 06:31.770
Thank you.

06:32.270 --> 06:34.770
Ohhh hello, Martin!

06:37.790 --> 06:41.690
You've been so kind to me - I wanted
to give you my new address.

06:41.870 --> 06:44.370
Oh, great!
I'd hate to lose touch!

06:44.560 --> 06:47.379
I also wanted to bring
you a farewell gift.

06:47.414 --> 06:50.260
My latest novel, "Foolish Escapade."

06:50.380 --> 06:54.680
It's the long-awaited sequel
to "The Rose and the Rapier."

06:55.390 --> 07:00.590
-Swell! -I was er, thinking of you
when I created the character of...

07:00.880 --> 07:04.880
...Lorenzo,
the lovesick gondolier...

07:06.190 --> 07:08.190
How 'bout that? Hah!

07:08.480 --> 07:11.680
Hey, where are my manners?
Let me show you out!

07:13.790 --> 07:16.800
Oh, by the way, the lock on
my suitcase is jammed.

07:16.835 --> 07:19.390
I was er, hoping that
you'd come and...

07:19.580 --> 07:23.580
-...tinker with it? -Oh gee, you know,
I'd love to, Deirdre. But I...

07:23.790 --> 07:26.590
I promised Frasier I'd do
something with him tonight.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.070
Oh oh, dad, didn't I mention it?

07:28.105 --> 07:30.780
I'm filling in for
The Happy Chef tonight...

07:30.980 --> 07:34.980
-...so, you're all hers!
-Oh, marvelous!

07:37.680 --> 07:40.080
Goodnight, Lorenzo.
Hello, Polly.

07:42.800 --> 07:46.000
-How can I help you?
<i>-Oh, I'm so glad I got through!</i>

07:46.270 --> 07:48.310
<i>I'm sitting here not
knowing what to do.</i>

07:48.345 --> 07:51.570
<i>I find myself lacking a certain spice.</i>

07:52.280 --> 07:54.831
Well Polly, if you want to shake up
your routine, why don't you er...

07:54.866 --> 07:57.380
...try something new and dangerous?

07:58.210 --> 08:02.610
Er, skydiving, belly-dancing, perhaps?
That ought to add some spice.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.500
<i>What are you talking about?! I'm making
an apple tart and I'm out of cinnamon!</i>

08:12.390 --> 08:15.590
I see. Listeners...

08:15.880 --> 08:18.680
...for the fourth
time this hour...

08:18.800 --> 08:22.200
I am not The Happy Chef.

08:22.410 --> 08:26.510
I am The Irritated Psychiatrist,
Dr. Frasier Crane!

08:28.320 --> 08:30.620
We'll be right back
after the news.

08:34.690 --> 08:38.490
And while we're on
the subject of tarts...

08:38.780 --> 08:41.136
I'm really sorry about that call.

08:41.172 --> 08:42.490
No, it's alright, Roz.
Why don't you...

08:42.900 --> 08:45.700
...just run along for your date?
I can handle the last ten minutes here.

08:45.840 --> 08:46.809
-Are you sure?
-Sure!

08:46.844 --> 08:49.240
I mean, I feel terrible leaving
you here alone in the lurch.

08:49.410 --> 08:51.953
We are a team, Frasier; you just
say the word and I'll stay...

08:51.988 --> 08:53.810
Hey, hold that elevator!

09:01.010 --> 09:01.863
Got a minute?

09:01.898 --> 09:05.710
Oh, yes. Er, look, I, I'm glad
you're still here. Er, listen...

09:05.910 --> 09:08.310
No-no-no, me first this time.

09:09.100 --> 09:10.500
Okay.

09:10.710 --> 09:14.110
I really think that we
should slow things down.

09:15.820 --> 09:17.604
Oh, I am so glad you said that!

09:17.639 --> 09:19.520
I wanted to say the
same thing but I was...

09:19.700 --> 09:21.800
I was afraid that you'd feel
I was rejecting you!

09:22.000 --> 09:26.400
Oh, how sensitive. And yet, at the
same time, how full of yourself.

09:32.420 --> 09:35.020
You are one tough nut, lady.

09:35.530 --> 09:39.230
-Well, all this definitely shows we're
doing the right thing. -Agreed.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.182
Frankly, now that we've
got that settled...

09:41.217 --> 09:43.400
-...do you mind if I ask you
a question about last night? -Yeah.

09:43.620 --> 09:47.020
-What the hell was that?!
-I have no idea!

09:47.600 --> 09:48.781
I... ever since I've gotten here...

09:48.816 --> 09:52.900
...you have done nothing but irritate
me like a persistent skin rash.

09:53.110 --> 09:55.386
Yes, and you me! And, and,
and last night was no different.

09:55.421 --> 09:57.510
You just kept talking
and talking and talking...

09:57.740 --> 09:58.981
...and I guess that mouth of yours...

09:59.016 --> 10:02.240
...just ticked me off so much
I just had to have it!

10:02.920 --> 10:06.320
-The whole thing... it's just,
it's so primitive! -Yeah, yeah...

10:06.530 --> 10:10.130
-...animal! We were just functioning
on instinct. -It's fascinating, really.

10:10.410 --> 10:13.210
Oh, oh, let's not dismiss
the element of danger.

10:13.410 --> 10:15.369
All those people outside that could
have walked in any moment...

10:15.404 --> 10:17.710
-...and caught us.
-That crossed my mind...

10:18.420 --> 10:21.720
For once, in my cautious,
buttoned-down life...

10:21.930 --> 10:24.930
...I felt like a real bad boy.

10:25.510 --> 10:28.410
I felt like a... dirty girl.

10:29.210 --> 10:33.410
-What did you just call yourself?
-I said "dirty girl."

10:35.830 --> 10:38.630
You bad boy.

10:39.820 --> 10:42.610
You dirty girl.

10:42.820 --> 10:45.520
You bad boy!

10:45.730 --> 10:50.830
-Dirty girl! -Bad boy...!
-Dirty girl...!

11:00.010 --> 11:01.385
How much time do we
have left on the news?

11:01.420 --> 11:04.640
Three minutes. But that's alright,
I can play lots of extra commercials!

11:05.720 --> 11:08.387
In local news, Congressman
Robert Gill was accused...

11:08.422 --> 11:10.810
...of accepting bribes from a
waste treatment facility.

11:10.930 --> 11:16.650
Asked to comment, the congressman said-
Yes! Yes! I am a bad boy, aren't I...

11:17.050 --> 11:22.750
...you dirty girl! Come to your
bad boy! Oh, yes... Oh, no!

11:23.130 --> 11:26.030
<i>-Is that the on-air light?
-Stop talking.</i>

11:26.150 --> 11:29.350
<i>-You must have hit the switch with your
elbow while we were... -Stop talking!</i>

11:29.540 --> 11:32.640
<i>-We'd better hurry up and get dressed
while we still... -Stop talking!</i>

11:48.380 --> 11:50.680
Okay, Fabio...

11:52.330 --> 11:53.930
I want two things.

11:54.120 --> 11:58.220
One: you will never make another
crack about my sex life.

11:58.440 --> 12:02.240
I don't care if I start
dating a lumber camp.

12:02.920 --> 12:07.320
-Done.
-And two: who's Dirty Girl?

12:07.870 --> 12:13.470
-I can't tell you that. -Oh, come on,
Frasier! I swear, I won't tell a soul!

12:14.630 --> 12:17.630
Yes? Not yet,
I'll call you back.

12:20.150 --> 12:21.850
Doc...

12:22.560 --> 12:26.660
-I got one thing to say to you...
-Go ahead, take your best shot.

12:26.860 --> 12:29.860
I am so proud of you, man.

12:31.860 --> 12:36.460
-Well, doesn't that just put the
cherry on the parfait. -Now come on...

12:36.660 --> 12:39.660
...you gotta tell me
who's the mystery chick?

12:39.930 --> 12:41.283
Bulldog, haven't you already seen?

12:41.318 --> 12:44.430
I've told half a dozen reporters
that I'm not going to name names.

12:44.640 --> 12:49.440
Yeah, don't you see this right here?
"'I Won't Fink,' Says Kinky Shrink."

12:53.350 --> 12:55.450
-Good afternoon, Dr Crane.
-Miss Costas.

12:55.640 --> 12:59.540
Hey, hey, you're the boss - make
him tell who his playmate was.

13:00.050 --> 13:02.128
Bulldog, this is really
none of your business.

13:02.163 --> 13:03.350
Oh, but we got a pool going.

13:03.560 --> 13:08.060
-So far, hot money's on Roz.
-What?! Oh, well, thank you...

13:08.260 --> 13:09.996
...but I think I have
a little more self-respect...

13:10.031 --> 13:13.460
...than to have a quickie
with a co-worker on the air!

13:16.070 --> 13:19.070
What kind of slut
do they think I am?

13:19.440 --> 13:22.440
Dr. Crane, could I have a word
with you in private?

13:22.590 --> 13:25.513
Er, I-I'd love that, but I, I've got
my show in two minutes.

13:25.548 --> 13:26.290
Actually you don't.

13:26.490 --> 13:29.390
-What?
-I'm suspending you for a week.

13:29.550 --> 13:33.750
-Bulldog, you're going on. Roz,
you'll have to produce. -Alright!

13:38.710 --> 13:41.410
I must say,
I find that a, a bit harsh...

13:41.670 --> 13:45.070
-...all things considered. -Yes, I can
see how you might feel that way.

13:45.310 --> 13:47.352
But the station does
have certain standards...

13:47.387 --> 13:49.010
...and it is my job to enforce them.

13:49.230 --> 13:52.830
Now if you will excuse me, I have to
meet with one of last night's sponsors.

13:52.970 --> 13:56.170
The Wholesome Family Cookie Company.

14:03.480 --> 14:05.880
Hey! Turn those lights out!

14:06.530 --> 14:09.830
-Why?
-Deirdre hasn't finished moving yet.

14:12.190 --> 14:14.020
If she sees the light in here,
she'll know I'm home!

14:14.055 --> 14:16.290
You can see your living room
from her bedroom.

14:16.490 --> 14:19.790
-Her bedroom...? -She had me
cornered in there yesterday.

14:19.920 --> 14:24.170
I don't mind telling you, I haven't
been that scared since Korea.

14:26.470 --> 14:27.428
Don't worry, dad.

14:27.463 --> 14:29.970
Look, I have no intention
of letting anyone in here tonight.

14:31.980 --> 14:33.861
There's a damn tabloid news
crew down in the lobby.

14:33.896 --> 14:37.080
I had to go in the back way and
use the service elevator.

14:37.300 --> 14:40.800
Say, I tuned in to your show
tonight. Why weren't you on it?

14:42.280 --> 14:46.380
-If you must know, I've been
suspended for a week. -Oh, no.

14:46.800 --> 14:50.100
I spent the last three hours at the
observation deck of the Space Needle.

14:50.300 --> 14:54.300
Looking down on a city
that's looking down on me.

14:55.890 --> 14:59.690
-Hello, Dr Crane.
-Daphne. I'm not here.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.909
Yes. Your father's not here either.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.880
It's so nice having the
whole house to myself.

15:08.630 --> 15:12.530
-Daphne. -Oh, how lovely.
Now the whole family's not here.

15:15.190 --> 15:18.290
I listened to your programme
as I was driving home last night.

15:18.460 --> 15:21.560
Here's a bill to replace the
front wheel of my Mercedes...

15:21.810 --> 15:23.077
...and the second to replace
the back bumper..

15:23.112 --> 15:25.810
...of some wretched
little domestic car.

15:26.760 --> 15:30.510
-Go easy on your brother, Niles - he's
had a rough day. -You're right, dad.

15:30.680 --> 15:33.502
Er, Frasier, please
accept my apologies.

15:33.537 --> 15:36.180
I, I can imagine how trying
this must have been for you.

15:36.390 --> 15:37.478
Thanks, Niles.

15:37.513 --> 15:41.490
'Course, it's been no picnic for
those of us who share your name.

15:44.220 --> 15:48.420
My Maris took it particularly
hard. When I left this morning...

15:48.620 --> 15:49.985
...she was ordering new stationery...

15:50.020 --> 15:53.520
...with an accent aigu
over the "e" in our name.

15:54.210 --> 15:59.310
Hereafter, her memos will read,
"From the desk of Maris Crané."

16:04.850 --> 16:08.650
-Who is it?
-Kate Costas. -Wait, wait!

16:09.490 --> 16:12.090
Alright, all of you. You know
nothing about last night!

16:13.150 --> 16:15.350
-Hello! -Hello.
-Come in!

16:15.590 --> 16:18.102
Hello, Kate. Er,
you know Niles, of course.

16:18.137 --> 16:20.190
Er, this is my father, Martin...

16:20.480 --> 16:22.880
...and er, his healthcare worker.
Daphne, Kate Costas.

16:23.110 --> 16:26.010
-Nice to meet you. -I'm sorry
if I'm coming at a bad time.

16:26.260 --> 16:29.960
Oh no, no, I, I - we were just
taking Eddie for a walk. Eddie!

16:30.080 --> 16:32.480
I have to be running along too.

16:33.140 --> 16:36.240
Oh, what's that on your chin? Have
you been in the garbage again?

16:36.490 --> 16:39.290
You Bad Boy!

16:51.910 --> 16:53.610
So... nice place.

16:54.020 --> 16:57.420
-Whoa, what a view!
-Yes.

16:58.410 --> 17:01.210
I'll be enjoying it
during my suspension.

17:01.560 --> 17:06.260
Well... I guess that concludes
the small-talk portion of our evening.

17:06.790 --> 17:10.290
-Look, it must be obvious; I've come
here to apologise. -Oh, really.

17:10.560 --> 17:14.760
For what? Turning on me when I went
out of my way to protect you?

17:14.950 --> 17:16.480
You know we're
both responsible for this.

17:16.515 --> 17:19.450
Yet I end up looking like an idiot
and you look like a no-nonsense boss!

17:19.640 --> 17:22.740
Alright, alright, just tell me what
I can do to make this right.

17:22.930 --> 17:24.585
Nothing! There is nothing you can do...

17:24.619 --> 17:26.630
...there is nothing you can say,
to make this up to me.

17:26.800 --> 17:30.600
-The owners wanted you fired.
-That's pretty good!

17:31.310 --> 17:34.041
Look, there's no way
we can rewrite the past.

17:34.076 --> 17:37.410
It happened, we did it, it's on tape.

17:38.240 --> 17:41.440
But we can do this: we can prevent
it from ever happening again.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.080
Agreed.

17:43.270 --> 17:46.970
Obviously, there's some kind of
incredible attraction between us.

17:47.160 --> 17:51.160
The trick will be simply to
avoid the opportunity. We're strong...

17:51.350 --> 17:53.750
...we're intelligent...

17:54.850 --> 17:58.550
-...and we're alone in this apartment.
-I'll get my bag! -Yes...

18:00.750 --> 18:03.575
Oh Kate, Kate, er, that news
crew's probably still in the lobby.

18:03.610 --> 18:06.650
Let me walk you to the service
elevator and see you out.

18:09.440 --> 18:13.540
-Going down? -No, you guys
go ahead. Just send it back up!

18:18.550 --> 18:20.412
Yes... well, I'm sure
if we really try...

18:20.447 --> 18:22.450
...we can keep things
on a professional footing.

18:22.790 --> 18:26.290
-We're two mature adults.
-Just have to avoid all undue...

18:26.510 --> 18:27.910
...temptation.

18:31.700 --> 18:34.300
-What's going on?
-I don't know. Hello?

18:34.840 --> 18:37.380
You know, let's have a little light.

18:38.010 --> 18:42.610
Hello? Hello? Can anybody hear me?

18:43.730 --> 18:47.230
-Yeah! What's going on?
<i>-Looks like you're stuck.</i>

18:47.420 --> 18:50.820
<i>Same thing happened this morning.
Took about half an hour to fix.</i>

18:51.060 --> 18:55.060
<i>-You two guys gonna be okay?</i>
-Yeah, yeah, we're fine. We're adults.

18:55.260 --> 18:57.460
We're mature adults!

19:16.460 --> 19:17.882
It's getting sort of hot
in here, isn't it?

19:17.917 --> 19:19.860
Yeah. It's a bit - it's a bit hot.

19:20.010 --> 19:21.768
You don't mind if I take off
my jacket, do you?

19:21.803 --> 19:23.910
Makes no difference to me.

19:30.350 --> 19:31.807
Looks like we're gonna be
here for a little while.

19:31.842 --> 19:34.550
May as well try to make
ourselves comfortable.

19:36.380 --> 19:38.980
Maybe there are
some chairs in here.

19:39.790 --> 19:43.490
Ah, here we are! I'll just
have to move this down along...

19:48.510 --> 19:53.110
-What's that? -I must have knocked
open a music box in here somewhere.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.919
-I'm not really in the mood for music.
Could you stop that, please?

19:57.954 --> 19:59.300
Yes, yes, I'll try.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.600
God, it's hot in here!

20:05.680 --> 20:09.180
-What's that smell? -I seem to have
broken a bottle of something...

20:11.720 --> 20:14.620
Musk oil...!

20:15.410 --> 20:18.110
Oh, oh, where is that
damn music box?

20:19.780 --> 20:21.680
Here it is!

20:22.310 --> 20:24.155
I really think that it would
be a very good thing...

20:24.190 --> 20:26.510
...if you just did something
about that musk oil...

20:28.710 --> 20:32.910
Oh, I know, hand me that drop-cloth
there and maybe I can just smother it.

20:38.580 --> 20:41.580
Who lives in this building?!

20:42.670 --> 20:46.038
You know er, I think we can just
forego the musk oil right now.

20:46.073 --> 20:47.970
Why don't you just cover,
cover that back up.

20:48.220 --> 20:52.420
No no no no no, not gonna touch this
thing again. Look at me, I'm all dirty.

20:58.190 --> 21:01.790
-Ooh, stop - stop - stop!
-You're right!

21:11.790 --> 21:16.190
We have gazed into the gaping
maw of temptation, and survived!

21:16.500 --> 21:19.800
My God, I'm, I'm,
I'm proud of us!

21:20.790 --> 21:22.990
I am, too! God!

21:26.400 --> 21:30.100
Of course, the cable could break.

21:31.290 --> 21:35.290
-And we'd be kicking ourselves all
the way down... -You are so right!

21:58.970 --> 22:02.470
-Goodnight, Dr Crane.
-Miss Costas.
