WEBVTT

00:10.959 --> 00:13.959
OKAY, KAZ,

00:10.959 --> 00:13.959
WOULD YOU RATHER...

00:14.000 --> 00:17.042
HAVE FREEZE FRAME'S

00:14.000 --> 00:17.042
POWER TO STOP TIME

00:17.083 --> 00:19.876
BUT YOU HAVE TO TALK

00:17.083 --> 00:19.876
LIKE A CHICKEN...

00:17.083 --> 00:19.876
( imitates chicken squawking )

00:19.918 --> 00:23.876
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">OR </font></i> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> TECTON'S</font>

00:19.918 --> 00:23.876
IMMUNITY TO PAIN,

00:23.918 --> 00:26.042
BUT YOU HAVE

00:23.918 --> 00:26.042
TO WEAR A DIAPER?

00:26.083 --> 00:29.042
OH, I'D WEAR A DIAPER--

00:26.083 --> 00:29.042
FOR TWO REASONS:

00:29.083 --> 00:31.000
NUMBER ONE...

00:31.042 --> 00:32.918
AND NUMBER TWO.

00:31.042 --> 00:32.918
( both laughing )

00:33.918 --> 00:35.959
( sighs )

00:33.918 --> 00:35.959
OLIVER, LOOK.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.042
THERE IT IS--

00:36.000 --> 00:39.042
THE METEORITE OF ZANDOR,

00:39.083 --> 00:42.042
THE SOURCE OF TECTON'S

00:39.083 --> 00:42.042
IMMEASURABLE POWERS.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.375
AH, I HAVE TO HAVE THIS.

00:44.417 --> 00:47.042
HIDDEN IN THE EARTH'S CRUST

00:44.417 --> 00:47.042
FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS,

00:47.083 --> 00:50.042
FORGED FROM A SUPERNOVA

00:47.083 --> 00:50.042
IN THE BALLAZAR GALAXY--

00:50.083 --> 00:51.876
SAYS "MADE IN TAIWAN."

00:51.918 --> 00:54.334
AH. WELL,

00:51.918 --> 00:54.334
I STILL WANT IT.

00:54.375 --> 00:56.542
BUT I'LL NEVER BE ABLE

00:54.375 --> 00:56.542
TO AFFORD IT.

00:56.584 --> 00:58.876
AH--BUT WE CAN STILL

00:56.584 --> 00:58.876
POSE WITH IT.

00:58.918 --> 01:00.959
EH, COMMEMORATIVE

00:58.918 --> 01:00.959
FAKE PHOTO.

01:02.584 --> 01:04.042

01:04.083 --> 01:05.125
( chuckles )

01:05.167 --> 01:07.334
OH, YOU BLINKED.

01:07.375 --> 01:09.000
( clearing throat )

01:09.042 --> 01:11.042
WE'LL TAKE THAT, THANK YOU.

01:09.042 --> 01:11.042
BOYS...

01:11.083 --> 01:13.083
YOU KNOW THE RULES

01:11.083 --> 01:13.083

01:11.083 --> 01:13.083
YEAH.

01:13.125 --> 01:15.042
RULE NUMBER ONE:

01:13.125 --> 01:15.042
NO TOUCHING THE MERCHANDISE.

01:15.083 --> 01:17.918
RULE NUMBER TWO:

01:15.083 --> 01:17.918
NO MISTAKING US FOR EACH OTHER.

01:17.959 --> 01:18.626
I'M CLYDE.

01:17.959 --> 01:18.626
I'M WALLACE.

01:18.667 --> 01:21.250
IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

01:21.292 --> 01:24.042
RULE NUMBER THREE:

01:21.292 --> 01:24.042
YOU <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> HAVE </font></i> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> TO USE THE RESTROOM,</font>

01:24.083 --> 01:27.083
IN THE CAULDRON OF KREPULAN.

01:28.083 --> 01:29.584
THAT WAS <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> ONE TIME.</font></i>

01:30.626 --> 01:32.459
OKAY, TWICE.

01:34.083 --> 01:36.042
OH, HEY, JORDAN.

01:36.083 --> 01:38.542
SHH. I'M TRAILING

01:36.083 --> 01:38.542
THIS MAJESTIC UNICORN.

01:38.584 --> 01:42.042
IT'S THE LAST ONE

01:38.584 --> 01:42.042
IN THE ENTIRE LAND.

01:42.083 --> 01:44.042
MMM...BOOM!

01:44.083 --> 01:46.209
CUT OFF ITS HEAD!

01:47.709 --> 01:52.042
AW, LOOK--ITS BLOOD

01:47.709 --> 01:52.042
IS MADE OF RAINBOWS.

01:52.083 --> 01:54.417
HEY, UH,

01:52.083 --> 01:54.417
WE WANTED TO TALK TO YOU

01:54.459 --> 01:56.542
ABOUT OUR ROBOT PROJECT

01:54.459 --> 01:56.542
FOR SCIENCE DAY TOMORROW.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.417
YEAH, THE THREE OF US

01:56.584 --> 01:58.417
ARE WORKING ON IT, RIGHT?

01:58.459 --> 02:01.042
YEP, IT'LL BE JUST

01:58.459 --> 02:01.042
THE THREE OF US.

02:01.083 --> 02:03.250
YOU, ME, AND KAZ...

02:01.083 --> 02:03.250
( chuckles nervously )

02:03.292 --> 02:04.500
AND GUS.

02:04.542 --> 02:05.751
WHAT?!

02:05.792 --> 02:07.167
GUS? NO, NO, NO.

02:07.209 --> 02:08.584
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

02:08.626 --> 02:10.542
I'M SORRY,

02:08.626 --> 02:10.542
BUT HE IS OUR FRIEND,

02:10.584 --> 02:12.083
AND WE JUST FELT BAD FOR HIM

02:12.125 --> 02:14.083
'CAUSE NO ONE ELSE

02:12.125 --> 02:14.083
WANTED HIM IN THEIR GROUP.

02:12.125 --> 02:14.083
( scoffs )

02:14.125 --> 02:16.542
YEAH, FOR THE SAME REASON

02:14.125 --> 02:16.542
NO ONE WANTS A DEAD FISH

02:14.125 --> 02:16.542
IN THEIR BED:

02:16.584 --> 02:19.083
THEY BOTH SMELL

02:16.584 --> 02:19.083
LIKE DEAD FISH.

02:19.125 --> 02:22.292
LOOK, IF I DON'T

02:19.125 --> 02:22.292
GET AN "A" ON THIS PROJECT,

02:22.334 --> 02:25.083
MY PARENTS WON'T LET ME

02:22.334 --> 02:25.083
PLAY VIDEO GAMES FOR A <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> YEAR!</font></i>

02:25.125 --> 02:28.042
AND IF I CAN'T CHOP OFF

02:25.125 --> 02:28.042
UNICORN HEADS, THEN...

02:28.083 --> 02:29.209
WHO AM I?

02:30.584 --> 02:32.042
WE PROMISE YOU...

02:32.083 --> 02:34.000
WE'LL KEEP GUS

02:32.083 --> 02:34.000
UNDER CONTROL.

02:34.042 --> 02:35.417
HE--HE WON'T SAY A WORD.

02:35.459 --> 02:38.042
REALLY? WHERE ARE WE

02:35.459 --> 02:38.042
GONNA GET A MUZZLE?

02:38.083 --> 02:41.334
FINE. JUST KEEP HIM

02:38.083 --> 02:41.334
AWAY FROM ME.

02:41.375 --> 02:43.042
NOW WE GOTTA

02:41.375 --> 02:43.042
GET A LEASH.

02:43.083 --> 02:45.000
THIS IS BECOMING

02:43.083 --> 02:45.000
A NIGHTMARE.

02:43.083 --> 02:45.000
( sighs )

02:46.667 --> 02:49.500
KAZ, IT'S SKYLAR STORM,

02:49.542 --> 02:51.584
MY FAVORITE COMIC BOOK

02:49.542 --> 02:51.584
SUPERHERO!

02:51.626 --> 02:53.709
( sighs )

02:51.626 --> 02:53.709
SHE HAS 24 SUPERPOWERS,

02:53.751 --> 02:55.292
INCLUDING X-RAY VISION...

02:55.334 --> 02:58.000
SO SHE CAN SEE

02:55.334 --> 02:58.000
HOW BIG MY HEART IS.

02:59.083 --> 03:01.083
OH, OLIVER, COME HERE

02:59.083 --> 03:01.083
AND KISS ME,

03:01.125 --> 03:03.209
BUT BE GENTLE BECAUSE YOU

03:01.125 --> 03:03.209
KNOW I'M MADE OF CARDBOARD.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.292
( imitates kissing )

03:04.334 --> 03:06.042
KAZ--KAZ, STOP.

03:06.083 --> 03:07.375
YOU HEARD WALLACE

03:06.083 --> 03:07.375
AND CLYDE.

03:07.417 --> 03:09.042
NO TOUCHING THE MERCHANDISE.

03:09.083 --> 03:12.000
OH, IT'S FINE.

03:09.083 --> 03:12.000
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?

03:19.834 --> 03:22.542
AND THE AWARD FOR THE MOST

03:19.834 --> 03:22.542
HUMILIATED PATIENTS

03:22.584 --> 03:24.292
IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM

03:22.584 --> 03:24.292
GOES TO...

03:24.334 --> 03:27.459
THE BOYS STUCK

03:24.334 --> 03:27.459
IN A FLYING SAUCER.

03:27.500 --> 03:31.584
( laughing )

03:27.500 --> 03:31.584
TAKE THAT, GUY WITH HIS HAND

03:27.500 --> 03:31.584
STUCK IN THE GUMBALL MACHINE.

03:31.626 --> 03:32.667
( Kaz chuckles )

03:34.125 --> 03:36.292
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT, KAZ.

03:36.334 --> 03:39.500
THIS IS SO TYPICAL.

03:36.334 --> 03:39.500
YOU ALWAYS DO THESE CRAZY THINGS

03:39.542 --> 03:41.125
AND EXPECT ME

03:39.542 --> 03:41.125
TO JUST FOLLOW YOU.

03:41.167 --> 03:42.626
HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

03:41.167 --> 03:42.626
FOLLOW ME.

03:43.626 --> 03:44.751
WHERE ARE WE GOING?!

03:44.792 --> 03:46.709
THE GUY WHO JUST

03:44.792 --> 03:46.709
WALKED INTO THE CLOSET--

03:46.751 --> 03:48.375
I THINK THAT'S

03:46.751 --> 03:48.375
THE BLUE TORNADO.

03:48.417 --> 03:50.125
YOU MEAN THE SUPERHERO?

03:50.167 --> 03:52.792
WHO CAN SPIN AT THE SPEED

03:50.167 --> 03:52.792
OF SOUND?

03:52.834 --> 03:55.000
AND IS MAKE-BELIEVE?

03:56.459 --> 03:58.375
I-I KNOW IT DOESN'T

03:56.459 --> 03:58.375
MAKE ANY SENSE,

03:58.417 --> 03:59.876
BUT IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE HIM.

03:59.918 --> 04:02.417
HE HAD THE SAME CROOKED NOSE,

03:59.918 --> 04:02.417
THE SAME SCAR ON HIS CHEEK.

04:02.459 --> 04:04.292
HE EVEN HAD A WISPY BEARD.

04:04.334 --> 04:06.167
SO DOES MY GRANDMOTHER!

04:06.209 --> 04:08.000
( grunts )

04:09.751 --> 04:11.334
( groaning )

04:13.417 --> 04:15.709
WHAT THE...?

04:13.417 --> 04:15.709
I DON'T GET IT.

04:15.751 --> 04:17.000
I JUST SAW HIM GO IN HERE.

04:17.041 --> 04:19.834
WELL, MAYBE ONE OF HIS POWERS

04:17.041 --> 04:19.834
IS TO TURN HIMSELF

04:19.875 --> 04:23.042
INTO A ROLL OF ONE-PLY

04:19.875 --> 04:23.042
TOILET PAPER.

04:23.083 --> 04:26.459
NOW, YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH

04:23.083 --> 04:26.459
DAMAGE FOR TODAY.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.834
CAN WE PLEASE JUST GO?

04:26.500 --> 04:28.834
YEAH.

04:28.876 --> 04:31.042
WAIT--

04:28.876 --> 04:31.042
( grunts )

04:28.876 --> 04:31.042
OW!

04:32.542 --> 04:34.042
Oliver: CHECK IT OUT!

04:34.083 --> 04:38.292
OH, I KNOW.

04:34.083 --> 04:38.292
MY MOM HAS THIS

04:34.083 --> 04:38.292
EXACT SAME MOP.

04:38.334 --> 04:39.500
NO. LOOK!

04:41.292 --> 04:42.792
SOME SORT OF PUZZLE.

04:42.834 --> 04:44.667
AND I THINK

04:42.834 --> 04:44.667
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

04:44.709 --> 04:46.250
( mutters )

04:44.709 --> 04:46.250
IS IT THE MAZE

04:46.292 --> 04:48.584
WHERE YOU HAVE TO HELP

04:46.292 --> 04:48.584
THE RABBIT FIND HIS CARROT?

04:48.626 --> 04:52.292
'CAUSE IF SO,

04:48.626 --> 04:52.292
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

04:48.626 --> 04:52.292
THOSE THINGS ARE IMPOSSIBLE.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.626
GOT IT.

04:53.667 --> 04:56.292
WHAT? IT'S THE SYMBOL

04:53.667 --> 04:56.292

04:56.334 --> 04:58.000
THE LEGENDARY HEALER

04:56.334 --> 04:58.000

04:59.584 --> 05:02.792
WHOA. IT SAYS "ENTER."

05:02.834 --> 05:04.667
( sighs )

05:02.834 --> 05:04.667
I GUESS THE BIG

05:02.834 --> 05:04.667
DECISION HERE IS...

05:04.709 --> 05:06.792
WHETHER OR NOT

05:04.709 --> 05:06.792
TO PUSH THE BUTTON.

05:06.834 --> 05:08.667
YOU WANNA PUSH IT,

05:06.834 --> 05:08.667
DON'T YOU?

05:08.709 --> 05:10.584
OH, I ALREADY DID.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here

05:25.542 --> 05:27.083
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

05:27.125 --> 05:29.042
HEY--

05:27.125 --> 05:29.042
THERE'S BLUE TORNADO.

05:31.083 --> 05:33.209
( whimpers )

05:31.083 --> 05:33.209
AND THERE'S SOLAR FLARE.

05:36.459 --> 05:39.209
OH, AND THERE'S INCOGNITO

05:36.459 --> 05:39.209
WITH HIS POWER OF INVISIBILITY.

05:39.250 --> 05:41.751
OKAY, NOW THIS

05:39.250 --> 05:41.751
MAY BE A LITTLE COLD.

05:41.792 --> 05:43.000
( murmurs )

05:44.751 --> 05:45.959
( grunts )

05:46.000 --> 05:47.792
THIS MUST BE

05:46.000 --> 05:47.792
SOME KIND OF, LIKE,

05:47.834 --> 05:49.792
SECRET SUPERHERO HOSPITAL.

05:49.834 --> 05:51.417
NO, THAT'S--

05:49.834 --> 05:51.417
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

05:51.459 --> 05:53.375
SUPERHEROES DON'T EXIST.

05:53.417 --> 05:54.584
THAT'S CRAZY.

07:01.250 --> 07:04.375
MY WHOLE WORLD HAS BEEN

07:01.250 --> 07:04.375
TURNED UPSIDE DOWN.

07:04.417 --> 07:06.000
NOT AS MUCH AS HERS.

07:09.292 --> 07:11.250
INCOMING! INCOMING!

07:11.292 --> 07:12.626
MAKE A PATH, PEOPLE.

07:12.667 --> 07:14.417
I'VE GOT

07:12.667 --> 07:14.417
A NON-RESPONSIVE HERO.

07:14.459 --> 07:17.125
TEMPERATURE IS 4,000

07:14.459 --> 07:17.125
DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

07:17.167 --> 07:19.834
AND HE'S OOZING WEIRD

07:17.167 --> 07:19.834
BLUE GLOWING STUFF.

07:19.876 --> 07:21.250
IT TASTES LIKE HUMMUS.

07:21.292 --> 07:24.000
THIS DUDE NEEDS MEDICAL

07:21.292 --> 07:24.000
ATTENTION STAT!

07:24.042 --> 07:26.959
THAT'S THE CRUSHER--THE

07:24.042 --> 07:26.959
STRONGEST MAN IN THE UNIVERSE.

07:24.042 --> 07:26.959
YEAH, WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

07:27.000 --> 07:29.751
HE'S GOING

07:27.000 --> 07:29.751
INTO CARDIAC ARREST, PEOPLE!

07:29.792 --> 07:32.626
OKAY, HE AND I

07:29.792 --> 07:32.626
HAVE THE SAME PERSONAL TRAINER.

07:32.667 --> 07:34.584
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

07:32.667 --> 07:34.584
CLEAR!

07:34.626 --> 07:36.417
( electricity humming,

07:34.626 --> 07:36.417
beeping )

07:36.459 --> 07:38.792
HIS HEART'S NOT RESPONDING.

07:36.459 --> 07:38.792
I DON'T UNDERSTAND!

07:38.834 --> 07:40.334
HE'S DYING.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.334
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

07:40.375 --> 07:42.167
HOLD ON.

07:40.375 --> 07:42.167
I-IF THE CRUSHER'S REAL,

07:42.209 --> 07:44.209
THEN...MAYBE EVERYTHING WE'VE

07:42.209 --> 07:44.209
READ ABOUT HIM IS REAL, TOO.

07:44.250 --> 07:46.626
O-OKAY, LET'S SEE.

07:44.250 --> 07:46.626
I-IN THE LATEST ISSUE, UH,

07:46.667 --> 07:49.375
THE CRUSHER HAS JUST RETURNED

07:46.667 --> 07:49.375
FROM THE PLANET EBRION.

07:49.417 --> 07:51.417
WHERE THE GRAVITY IS 40 TIMES

07:49.417 --> 07:51.417
THAT OF EARTH.

07:51.459 --> 07:53.167
HE'S CRASHING.

07:51.459 --> 07:53.167
CLEAR!

07:53.209 --> 07:54.751
( electricity humming,

07:53.209 --> 07:54.751
beeping )

07:54.792 --> 07:56.334
UH, MAYBE THE EXTREME GRAVITY

07:56.375 --> 07:58.584
PULLED HIS HEART FROM HIS CHEST

07:56.375 --> 07:58.584
DOWN TO HIS FEET!

07:58.626 --> 07:59.834
THEY'RE SHOCKING

07:58.626 --> 07:59.834
THE WRONG PLACE.

07:59.876 --> 08:01.500
HERE, GIVE ME THOSE!

08:01.542 --> 08:04.000
CLEAR!

08:01.542 --> 08:04.000
WAIT, KAZ--

08:01.542 --> 08:04.000
WHAT ARE YOU...?

08:08.083 --> 08:09.125
( yelling )

08:13.083 --> 08:16.500
THANK YOU, NURSE.

08:13.083 --> 08:16.500
I'LL NEED THE HENDERSON

08:13.083 --> 08:16.500
X-RAYS I MY OFFICE.

08:16.542 --> 08:18.500
OH, AND I'LL NEED AN OFFICE.

08:18.542 --> 08:21.209
KAZ, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:18.542 --> 08:21.209
WE'RE NOT DOCTORS.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.042
YOU'RE NOT?

08:21.250 --> 08:23.042
GUARDS!

08:23.083 --> 08:24.626
OH, NO--

08:23.083 --> 08:24.626
WE'RE NOT GUARDS, EITHER.

08:26.959 --> 08:28.250
NO, BUT THEY ARE!

08:29.334 --> 08:31.792
COMMEMORATIVE

08:29.334 --> 08:31.792
TERRIFIED FAKE PHOTO?

08:38.292 --> 08:40.542
TAKE IT EASY--

08:40.583 --> 08:41.958
MY MOM JUST

08:40.583 --> 08:41.958
IRONED THIS SHIRT.

08:43.667 --> 08:45.626
WHAT DO YOU THINK

08:43.667 --> 08:45.626
THEY'RE GONNA DO TO US?

08:46.918 --> 08:48.876
IT SAYS, "NOW YOU DIE"!

08:48.918 --> 08:50.709
DO YOU THINK

08:48.918 --> 08:50.709
THEY MEAN YOU OR ME?

08:50.751 --> 08:53.459
WELL, IT SAYS "YOU."

08:53.500 --> 08:54.876
Distorted voice: <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> SILENCE!</font></i>

08:54.918 --> 08:57.792
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">YOU HAVE TRESPASSED</font></i>

08:54.918 --> 08:57.792
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">IN MY HOSPITAL,</font></i>

08:57.834 --> 08:59.792
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">AND FOR THAT,</font></i>

08:57.834 --> 08:59.792
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">THE PUNISHMENT IS...</font></i>

08:59.834 --> 09:00.876
ALAN!

09:00.918 --> 09:02.792
THE PUNISHMENT IS ALAN!

09:04.375 --> 09:05.834
STUPID SIGN.

09:06.918 --> 09:09.334
Oliver: OH,

09:06.918 --> 09:09.334
"KNOW YOUR DIET FACTS."

09:09.375 --> 09:11.792
THAT'S FAR LESS SCARY.

09:11.834 --> 09:13.751
ALAN, WHAT ARE YOU

09:11.834 --> 09:13.751
DOING IN THE CAFETERIA?

09:13.792 --> 09:15.500
UH, NOTHING,

09:13.792 --> 09:15.500
UNCLE HORACE.

09:15.542 --> 09:17.042
IS THAT MY MUG?

09:17.083 --> 09:18.250
SEND IT OVER.

09:23.792 --> 09:25.751
"WORLD'S SEXIEST

09:23.792 --> 09:25.751
CHIEF OF STAFF

09:25.792 --> 09:28.375
AND VICE CHANCELLOR

09:25.792 --> 09:28.375
OF MEDICAL ADMINISTRATION."

09:28.417 --> 09:31.000
BOUGHT THIS AT A GAS STATION.

09:28.417 --> 09:31.000
WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

09:33.542 --> 09:35.042
I'M DR. HORACE DIAZ,

09:35.083 --> 09:36.292
HEAD OF THIS HOSPITAL.

09:36.334 --> 09:37.751
WHO ARE YOU

09:36.334 --> 09:37.751
AND WHAT CAN YOU DO?

09:37.792 --> 09:40.000
WELL, I'M KAZ,

09:40.042 --> 09:41.834
AND I...

09:41.876 --> 09:43.709
CAN DO THIS.

09:45.626 --> 09:47.542
ANYBODY CAN DO THAT.

09:47.584 --> 09:49.667
I MEANT,

09:47.584 --> 09:49.667
"WHAT ARE YOUR POWERS?"

09:49.709 --> 09:50.876
OH, WE DON'T

09:49.709 --> 09:50.876
HAVE ANY POWERS.

09:50.918 --> 09:52.459
WHAT?!

09:52.500 --> 09:53.626
YOU'RE NORMOS?

09:53.667 --> 09:55.834
NORMOS CAN'T KNOW

09:53.667 --> 09:55.834
ABOUT MIGHTY MED.

09:55.876 --> 09:57.542
I'M GONNA GET A NORMO CAGE.

09:57.584 --> 10:00.417
NOT SO FAST.

10:01.751 --> 10:03.834
THE CRUSHER IS ONE OF OUR

10:01.751 --> 10:03.834
MOST IMPORTANT HEROES,

10:03.876 --> 10:05.083
AND YOU SAVED HIS LIFE.

10:05.125 --> 10:08.042
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT HIS HEART

10:05.125 --> 10:08.042
WASN'T IN HIS CHEST?

10:08.083 --> 10:10.042
UH, WELL, I THOUGHT

10:08.083 --> 10:10.042
THE SUPER-GRAVITY ON EBRION

10:10.083 --> 10:12.584
MIGHT HAVE PULLED HIS HEART

10:10.083 --> 10:12.584
DOWN TO HIS FEET.

10:12.626 --> 10:13.918
VERY CLEVER.

10:13.959 --> 10:16.334
YOU FIGURED THAT OUT

10:13.959 --> 10:16.334
FASTER THAN OUR BEST DOCTORS,

10:16.375 --> 10:17.667
EVEN DR. BRAINHEAD,

10:17.709 --> 10:21.042
AND HIS ENTIRE HEAD

10:17.709 --> 10:21.042
IS A BRAIN!

10:21.083 --> 10:24.042
YEAH, WE PRETTY MUCH EAT,

10:21.083 --> 10:24.042
DRINK, AND BREATHE SUPERHEROES.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.751
MM-HMM.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.751
LITERALLY.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.876
THIS MORNING, I HAD A BOWL

10:25.792 --> 10:28.876
OF HONEY-NUT BLUE TORNADO-O's.

10:28.918 --> 10:31.375
A TRUE FAN.

10:28.918 --> 10:31.375
LOVE THIS GUY!

10:31.417 --> 10:34.709
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE

10:31.417 --> 10:34.709
SOMEONE LIKE YOU AROUND HERE.

10:34.751 --> 10:36.792
( muffled grunting )

10:34.751 --> 10:36.792
WHAT'S THAT NOISE?

10:36.834 --> 10:38.000
OH, RIGHT. ALAN.

10:40.083 --> 10:41.751
WE CAN'T HAVE NORMOS HERE.

10:41.792 --> 10:44.459
I HEARD THAT IF YOU TOUCH THEM,

10:41.792 --> 10:44.459
YOUR BUTT FALLS OFF.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.542
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

10:46.584 --> 10:48.876
THAT'S NOT TRUE, IS IT?

10:48.918 --> 10:50.042
UM, NO.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.667
GOOD.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.667
BECAUSE WITHOUT A BUTT,

10:52.709 --> 10:54.500
WHAT WOULD I SHAKE

10:52.709 --> 10:54.500
ON THE DANCE FLOOR?

10:55.751 --> 10:57.751
SO, YOU WANT US TO WORK HERE?

10:57.792 --> 10:59.751
NOT "US." YOU.

10:59.792 --> 11:03.000
YOUR FRIEND OVER THERE

10:59.792 --> 11:03.000
SEEMS A BIT...OFF.

11:03.042 --> 11:04.542
WONDER WHAT THIS BUTTON DOES.

11:04.584 --> 11:06.042
( beeping )

11:04.584 --> 11:06.042
( buzzing )

11:06.083 --> 11:08.000
( screaming )

11:09.167 --> 11:11.542
( panting )

11:11.584 --> 11:14.542
THAT WAS...AWESOME.

11:14.584 --> 11:15.959
( laughing )

11:16.000 --> 11:17.751
I THINK HE JUST

11:16.000 --> 11:17.751
PROVED MY POINT.

11:17.792 --> 11:19.042
YOU--WITH ME.

11:19.083 --> 11:21.042
YOU--DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW

11:21.083 --> 11:23.792
IF YOU TAKE A SMALL

11:21.083 --> 11:23.792
OR MEDIUM NORMO CAGE?

11:23.834 --> 11:25.000
WHAT--WHOA, WHOA.

11:25.042 --> 11:26.459
I WANNA WORK HERE, TOO.

11:26.500 --> 11:29.042
I KNOW JUST AS MUCH

11:26.500 --> 11:29.042
ABOUT SUPERHEROES AS HE DOES.

11:29.083 --> 11:30.000
RIGHT, OLIVER?

11:30.042 --> 11:31.459
BACK ME UP.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.667
YEAH, KAZ IS GREAT.

11:33.709 --> 11:35.959
AND, WELL, WE KINDA

11:33.709 --> 11:35.959

11:36.000 --> 11:37.042
OKAY,

11:37.083 --> 11:38.751
I'LL GIVE YOU BOYS

11:37.083 --> 11:38.751
A TRIAL RUN.

11:38.792 --> 11:40.042
YES! WE GET TO WORK

11:40.083 --> 11:41.792
WITH REAL SUPERHEROES!

11:41.834 --> 11:43.042
YEAH, MAN, I CAN'T WAIT

11:41.834 --> 11:43.042
TO TELL GUS AND JORDAN

11:43.083 --> 11:44.042
ABOUT THIS PLACE.

11:44.083 --> 11:45.709
ARE YOU CRAZY?

11:45.751 --> 11:47.876
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYONE

11:45.751 --> 11:47.876
ABOUT MIGHTY MED.

11:47.918 --> 11:49.042
IT'S A TOP-SECRET HOSPITAL.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.167
ALAN, STOP INTERRUPTING.

11:51.209 --> 11:53.792
ARE YOU CRAZY?

11:53.834 --> 11:55.667
YOU CAN'T TELL ANYONE

11:53.834 --> 11:55.667
ABOUT MIGHTY MED.

11:55.709 --> 11:58.042
IT'S A TOP-SECRET HOSPITAL.

11:58.083 --> 12:00.751
ANOTHER THING:

11:58.083 --> 12:00.751
IF YOUR FRIEND HERE

11:58.083 --> 12:00.751
MESSES UP,

12:00.792 --> 12:03.167
I'M HOLDING YOU RESPONSIBLE.

12:07.167 --> 12:10.125
HERE THAT?

12:07.167 --> 12:10.125
NO GOOFING AROUND.

12:10.167 --> 12:11.959
DO NOT KAZ THIS UP FOR ME.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.542
ABSOLUTELY.

12:14.584 --> 12:16.209
OOH. WONDER WHAT

12:14.584 --> 12:16.209
THIS BUTTON DOES.

12:16.250 --> 12:17.542
( beeping )

12:17.584 --> 12:19.709
HMM. NOTHING.

12:19.751 --> 12:20.709
( yelps )

12:20.751 --> 12:21.918
NOT NOTHING!

12:29.709 --> 12:31.542
NOW, LET ME

12:29.709 --> 12:31.542
SHOW YOU BOYS AROUND.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.918
THIS IS A WEB-UNTANGALIZER

12:33.959 --> 12:36.083
FOR OUR ARACHNID-BASED

12:33.959 --> 12:36.083
SUPERHEROES.

12:36.125 --> 12:39.167
THIS IS A MOLECULAR

12:36.125 --> 12:39.167
DE-VAPORIZER.

12:39.209 --> 12:41.834
A LOT OF PEOPLE GET VAPORIZED

12:39.209 --> 12:41.834
IN THIS BUSINESS.

12:41.876 --> 12:44.834
THIS IS A PICTURE OF A BRIDGE.

12:44.876 --> 12:46.626
I LOVE BRIDGES!

12:47.834 --> 12:50.167
THIS IS THE REC ROOM,

12:50.209 --> 12:52.083
WHERE RECOVERING SUPERHEROES

12:52.125 --> 12:56.000
WORK ON STRENGTHENING POWERS

12:52.125 --> 12:56.000
AND HONING SUPER-SKILLS.

12:56.042 --> 12:58.751
OKAY, SO,

12:56.042 --> 12:58.751
IF SUPERHEROES ARE REAL

12:58.792 --> 13:00.042
AND OUT THERE

12:58.792 --> 13:00.042
SAVING THE WORLD,

13:00.083 --> 13:01.709
HOW COME WE

13:00.083 --> 13:01.709
NEVER SEE YOU GUYS?

13:01.751 --> 13:02.876
IT'S A COMBINATION OF THINGS.

13:02.918 --> 13:04.918
SOMETIMES WE

13:02.918 --> 13:04.918
ERASE THE MEMORIES

13:04.959 --> 13:06.918
OF NORMOS

13:04.959 --> 13:06.918
WHO WITNESS OUR HEROICS.

13:06.959 --> 13:08.918
USUALLY WE DON'T NEED TO

13:06.959 --> 13:08.918
BECAUSE MOST OF YOU

13:08.959 --> 13:11.584
ARE LOOKING DOWN

13:08.959 --> 13:11.584
AT YOUR PHONES ALL THE TIME.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.042
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

13:15.083 --> 13:17.083
PLUS, SOME OF US

13:15.083 --> 13:17.083
ARE INVISIBLE.

13:17.125 --> 13:20.626
AND SOMETIMES WE DO THINGS

13:17.125 --> 13:20.626
SO FAST, YOU DON'T EVEN SEE IT--

13:20.667 --> 13:23.000
LIKE HOW YOU AND I

13:20.667 --> 13:23.000

13:24.334 --> 13:25.667
NO WE DIDN'T.

13:25.709 --> 13:27.751
OR DID WE?

13:25.709 --> 13:27.751
( chuckles )

13:29.083 --> 13:31.209
BUT, I-IF YOU GUYS

13:29.083 --> 13:31.209
ACT IN SECRET,

13:31.250 --> 13:34.083
THEN WHY ARE THERE

13:31.250 --> 13:34.083
SUPERHERO COMIC BOOKS

13:31.250 --> 13:34.083
AND GRAPHIC NOVELS?

13:34.125 --> 13:36.292
WE CHRONICLE OUR ADVENTURES

13:34.125 --> 13:36.292
AND SELL THEM TO THE PUBLIC

13:36.334 --> 13:39.042

13:39.083 --> 13:42.584

13:51.667 --> 13:53.709
I KNOW.

13:51.667 --> 13:53.709
SORRY THEY'RE SO BULKY.

13:53.751 --> 13:56.751
THE MM-200-S

13:56.792 --> 13:58.792

YESTERDAY, I WAS AMBUSHED

14:36.125 --> 14:38.709

14:38.751 --> 14:42.042
TOOK MY INVISIBLE

14:38.751 --> 14:42.042

14:42.083 --> 14:44.000
HE EVEN STOLE MY COSTUME.

14:44.042 --> 14:46.792
HE LEFT ME JUST STANDING THERE

14:44.042 --> 14:46.792

( chuckles )

15:41.083 --> 15:43.792
I MEANT FOR OUR

15:41.083 --> 15:43.792

15:56.959 --> 15:59.500
AND OBVIOUSLY

15:56.959 --> 15:59.500

15:59.542 --> 16:02.000
ANYWAYS, YOU ASKED

15:59.542 --> 16:02.000

16:02.042 --> 16:03.959
AND I FOUND THIS IN MY ROOM.

16:07.959 --> 16:10.209
MY PARENTS GIVE ME MONEY

16:07.959 --> 16:10.209

16:21.834 --> 16:23.417
WE HAVE TO GO.

16:23.459 --> 16:25.334
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY

16:23.459 --> 16:25.334

18:02.083 --> 18:04.125
MEGAHERTZ WAS ROBBING

18:02.083 --> 18:04.125
THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK.

18:04.167 --> 18:06.709
WHEN HE TRIED TO MAKE

18:04.167 --> 18:06.709
AN UNAUTHORIZED WITHDRAWAL,

18:06.751 --> 18:08.542
I STOPPED HIM.

18:08.584 --> 18:09.584
UNFORTUNATELY,

18:09.626 --> 18:12.000
HE MADE AN UNAUTHORIZED DEPOSIT

18:12.042 --> 18:14.459
OF THIS STOP SIGN

18:12.042 --> 18:14.459
IN MY CHEST.

18:15.626 --> 18:18.125
MAN, HOW COOL IS THIS GUY?

18:18.167 --> 18:20.542
HE'S SKEWERED AND HE'S

18:18.167 --> 18:20.542

18:20.584 --> 18:22.000
WHEEL TECTON TO THE O.R.

18:29.083 --> 18:32.167

18:32.209 --> 18:34.083
ARE YOU KIDDING?

18:34.125 --> 18:36.334
WE'D LOVE TO.

18:34.125 --> 18:36.334

18:36.375 --> 18:40.542
OH, BUT...WE KIND OF

18:36.375 --> 18:40.542
HAVE A PRIOR COMMITMENT.

18:40.584 --> 18:42.709
HUH. I THOUGHT YOUR COMMITMENT

18:42.751 --> 18:44.542
WAS TO THIS HOSPITAL.

18:44.584 --> 18:46.167
GUESS I MISJUDGED YOU.

18:46.209 --> 18:47.626

18:49.459 --> 18:51.334
IT WOULD BE

18:49.459 --> 18:51.334
A DREAM COME TRUE.

18:51.375 --> 18:54.042
IT'S JUST...

18:51.375 --> 18:54.042

WHO SAVE PEOPLE.

19:05.500 --> 19:08.459
OH, I TOLD YOU

19:05.500 --> 19:08.459
YOU SHOULD'VE TRADEMARKED THAT.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.083
TOO LATE!

19:19.083 --> 19:20.375
UGH.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.209
UGH.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.042
OH, NO.

19:30.083 --> 19:31.584
WHAT?!

19:31.626 --> 19:34.209
YOU'RE DOING THIS ALL WRONG.

19:34.250 --> 19:36.042
WHERE IS THE RUDDER?

19:36.083 --> 19:37.209
AND THE OARS?

19:37.250 --> 19:40.000
THIS IS THE WORST ROWBOAT

19:37.250 --> 19:40.000
I'VE EVER SEEN.

19:41.459 --> 19:44.042
WE'RE NOT MAKING

ROBOT!

19:50.167 --> 19:53.626
IN THAT CASE, WOULD YOU

19:50.167 --> 19:53.626
BE INTERESTED IN BUYING

19:53.667 --> 19:56.083
TEN POUNDS OF LIVE BAIT?

19:57.375 --> 19:59.667
DEAD BAIT?

20:03.083 --> 20:04.667
( phone ringing )

20:04.709 --> 20:06.042
OH. HI, JORDAN.

20:06.083 --> 20:07.667
