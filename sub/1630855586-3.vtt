00:06.006 --> 00:08.425
<i>When a being considers
the vastness of the orb,</i>

00:08.425 --> 00:11.720
<i>they're often reminded of
their own insect-like tininess.</i>

00:11.720 --> 00:13.931
<i>These moments of reflection
can sometimes result</i>

00:13.931 --> 00:15.432
<i>in a sensation of helplessness.</i>

00:15.432 --> 00:18.894
<i>But with that uncertainty comes
the feeling of great possibility.</i>

00:20.103 --> 00:23.565
<i>The orb contains so many possibilities
that oftentimes,</i>

00:23.565 --> 00:25.859
<i>beings underestimate its potential</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:29.863
<i>and fail to realize that when
one opportunity seems so far away,</i>

00:29.863 --> 00:32.533
<i>another one may be much closer
than you think.</i>

00:40.832 --> 00:43.585
<i>Here's our orb
It's slightly leaning</i>

00:43.585 --> 00:45.379
<i>Orbiting a star</i>

00:46.129 --> 00:48.799
<i>We find ways to give life meaning</i>

00:48.799 --> 00:50.425
<i>Some might seem bizarre</i>

00:51.385 --> 00:53.637
<i>All we know is that we exist</i>

00:53.637 --> 00:56.598
<i>And it won't be for long
So it helps to put some foot tubes on</i>

00:56.598 --> 00:58.934
<i>Joy and sadness, courage and fear</i>

00:58.934 --> 01:01.603
<i>Curiosity and anger
On a planet full of danger</i>

01:01.603 --> 01:03.814
<i>And it's only getting stranger
From here</i>

01:24.293 --> 01:25.294
What is--

01:38.849 --> 01:40.851
I'm not usually up at the crack of star.

01:41.518 --> 01:44.771
Likewise. This was the only time
I could cleanse my tubes.

01:46.106 --> 01:49.193
<i>A-well, you just can't be
Too careful now</i>

01:49.193 --> 01:51.403
<i>At a cliff on the side of the road</i>

01:52.154 --> 01:55.240
<i>But if you wanna eat a meal
That's a cut above</i>

01:55.240 --> 01:57.451
<i>While you worry 'bout
What's waiting below</i>

01:57.451 --> 01:58.911
<i>A-well, you gotta go</i>

01:58.911 --> 02:04.458
<i>Gotta go to Careful Now
You gotta go to Careful Now</i>

02:04.458 --> 02:07.294
<i>Every meal is bliss
When you're on the abyss</i>

02:07.294 --> 02:09.880
- <i>At Careful Now</i>
- <i>Don't fall down</i>

02:10.506 --> 02:12.424
I can't believe they're still playing
this commercial.

02:12.424 --> 02:14.927
They must have made it 20 revolutions ago.

02:14.927 --> 02:16.094
That's a real place?

02:16.094 --> 02:18.805
Yeah. It's perched dangerously
on the edge of a cliff.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.391
I heard it's about to break off
and plunge into the void.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.476
Oh, no.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.312
They've been saying that forever though.
I guess you've never been?

02:25.312 --> 02:27.856
No. I just moved here
to live with my sibling.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.358
They're expecting their first offspring.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.652
That's so sweet.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.445
If you know of any good places

02:33.445 --> 02:35.447
that aren't perched
dangerously on a cliff,

02:35.447 --> 02:36.657
I'd love to know about them.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.492
It's not that dangerous.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.785
I was there a few weeks ago

02:39.785 --> 02:41.703
for a last-day-as-a-single-being
celebration.

02:42.704 --> 02:43.664
It wasn't mine.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.749
No, I'm still in my days
as a single being.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.551
That being's got the right idea.

02:55.551 --> 02:58.512
Yep. Warm foot fabric tubes
straight out the tumble heater.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.641
Oh, no! That's mine.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.643
Stand back. I can handle this.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.657
I'm sorry about that.
I feel like it's my fault.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.617
Oh, please. It's no big deal.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.786
I can run out and get you a fresh cup
from somewhere.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.162
Is that cliff place nearby?

03:24.162 --> 03:25.414
For sure, yeah.

03:25.414 --> 03:29.501
Okay. Well, I can go there and grab it.

03:30.002 --> 03:32.546
- Or...
- Or?

03:32.546 --> 03:35.257
Or would you want to go sit there

03:35.257 --> 03:38.135
and consume jitter liquid
together on purpose?

03:38.135 --> 03:39.219
Yes.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.346
It won't fall into the void today, right?

03:41.346 --> 03:42.431
I doubt it.

03:45.434 --> 03:48.353
If you have any thoughts
for this revolution's rooftop attraction,

03:48.353 --> 03:50.898
speak now or forever hold
your flavormuscle.

03:50.898 --> 03:54.401
Every revolution, I suggest something
with purpose and function.

03:54.401 --> 03:55.736
And every revolution,

03:55.736 --> 03:59.156
you opt for an attraction
that is neither purposeful nor functional.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.658
That's because I choose
to live with flair.

04:02.409 --> 04:05.204
Welcome to Careful Now.
Would you like to sit or scoot?

04:06.413 --> 04:07.414
Scoot?

04:10.334 --> 04:12.419
Can I get someone
to get you some jitter liquid?

04:12.419 --> 04:13.712
- Yes, please.
- That'd be great.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.047
Coming right up.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.841
This is nice. Once you're inside,
it doesn't feel like

04:17.841 --> 04:18.926
you could perish at any moment.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.053
Well, you haven't tried
the sustenance yet.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.976
- What part of Burg do you--
- You know about Double Shadow Day?

04:28.977 --> 04:30.479
Apologies. Go ahead.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.106
I was just wondering if you know
about Double Shadow Day.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.024
It's coming up.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.610
Is that the eclipse?
My sibling mentioned it to me.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.571
We thought it would be exciting
if their offspring emerged that day.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.114
That would be.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.201
I believe in the interconnectedness
of our orb and our life cycles

04:44.201 --> 04:45.827
from the moment of emergence.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.205
And Double Shadow is a great day.

04:48.205 --> 04:52.167
But the weeks leading up to it
can be a little messy.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.085
Really?

04:53.085 --> 04:56.213
Big time. Beings can get
completely out of sorts.

04:56.213 --> 04:58.757
They say not to make any important
decisions in these weeks

04:58.757 --> 05:00.717
because you may not be thinking clearly.

05:00.717 --> 05:04.179
I made the decision to ask you
for jitter liquid, and that worked out.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.145
Look at this view.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.899
We need an attraction that helps people
appreciate the greatness

05:15.899 --> 05:17.734
of what sits in front of them.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.736
How about some nice tables and chairs?

05:19.736 --> 05:22.239
Boring. Plus, that won't work in the rain.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.491
Beings can sit inside if it rains.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.661
I want this attraction
to be enjoyable all revolution long.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.706
- We can put up a tent.
- Then you can't see the sky!

05:30.706 --> 05:36.003
Let's think bigger and more precariously,
like a zip line over the void.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.130
Beings love to dangle on wires.

05:38.130 --> 05:39.840
I am going to check on my patrons.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.050
A trapeze could be fun.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.303
They are one of my favorite
pretenders as well.

05:44.928 --> 05:47.723
I've heard as a civilian being,
they are not that friendly.

05:47.723 --> 05:49.600
But I still think they are very talented.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.019
Perhaps we could go see
their newest moving image together?

05:53.604 --> 05:57.649
I find you very easy to converse with.
But I don't wanna deceive you.

05:57.649 --> 06:00.152
I'm not ready to commit
to a romance right now.

06:01.028 --> 06:04.239
I see. That's okay.
I'm not looking for anything serious.

06:04.239 --> 06:07.868
It's just with Double Shadow Day
coming up, I don't think it's a good idea.

06:07.868 --> 06:11.622
I would not wanna send a message
to the orb that I am open to change.

06:11.622 --> 06:13.790
- Apologies.
- No apologies necessary.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.251
Instead of dealing with feelings directly,
you are avoiding them

06:16.251 --> 06:18.795
while placing blame
on the shifting positions of the moons.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.882
- I understand.
- Perhaps I should go.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.842
Can I leave some currency
for my jitter liquid?

06:23.842 --> 06:27.346
It is not necessary, but I will think
more highly of you if you do.

06:27.346 --> 06:28.931
Maybe it's better I don't then.

06:31.767 --> 06:32.851
Hey!

06:32.851 --> 06:34.937
Sorry about your broken blood pump.

06:34.937 --> 06:37.564
You really wear your blood pump
on your sleeve, huh?

06:37.564 --> 06:39.316
I-- Do I?

06:39.316 --> 06:41.860
- I heard you say you just moved here.
- How did you hear that?

06:41.860 --> 06:45.155
And I believe that one being's misfortune
is another being's lucky day.

06:45.155 --> 06:48.075
In this case, you are the being
with the misfortune.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.327
And I am the being with the lucky day.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.663
Do you need a job?
We could use a little more help.

06:53.372 --> 06:54.498
I don't know.

06:54.498 --> 06:56.542
I heard this place might fall
into the void soon.

06:56.542 --> 06:58.919
It might. But you know what they say,

06:58.919 --> 07:01.421
"When one door closes, another door opens.

07:01.421 --> 07:05.217
And you won't know if you're gonna fall
into the gaping hole underneath it

07:05.217 --> 07:06.635
until you walk through."

07:06.635 --> 07:11.181
I've never heard that saying.
But I do need a job.

07:11.181 --> 07:14.226
- Uh-huh?
- And I'd love to meet some new beings.

07:14.226 --> 07:16.812
But I've never worked
in a restaurant before.

07:16.812 --> 07:19.189
Your negotiating skills
could use some work,

07:19.189 --> 07:21.149
but I think you're perfect for the job.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.693
Let's go meet the rest of the staff.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.361
Here they are.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.530
You hired this being?

07:26.530 --> 07:29.491
Not yet, but we do need someone
to start immediately.

07:29.491 --> 07:32.244
The other night, you covered
for half of the waitstaff.

07:32.244 --> 07:34.997
You did great
but also lit a table on fire.

07:34.997 --> 07:36.915
Well, there's plenty to do--
There always is.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.125
But who even is this?

07:38.125 --> 07:39.501
A good kid. Probably.

07:39.501 --> 07:42.671
Actually, I'm 22 revolutions.

07:42.671 --> 07:44.715
I graduated
with high back pats and everything.

07:45.549 --> 07:50.137
A great kid. Just moved here,
probably great at all sorts of stuff.

07:50.137 --> 07:55.058
Remind you of any other valiant beings
you knew around ten revolutions ago?

07:55.601 --> 07:58.228
We could use a fresh
point of view around here.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.898
I bet they can add some spice
to this old place.

08:02.316 --> 08:04.318
We'll try you out and see
if you can handle it.

08:04.318 --> 08:05.402
What's your strongest skill?

08:06.195 --> 08:08.030
Learning new skills.

08:08.030 --> 08:11.617
See? Always learning.
Go on, give them the tour.

08:11.617 --> 08:14.828
I'll be on the roof, brainstorming
our latest attraction.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.247
If you have any ideas, I'm all ears.

08:18.290 --> 08:21.752
Every revolution, they unveil
a new rooftop attraction

08:21.752 --> 08:24.713
to both attract new patrons
and entertain our regulars.

08:24.713 --> 08:27.633
They are usually poorly thought-out
and difficult to use.

08:27.633 --> 08:28.759
What was it last revolution?

08:28.759 --> 08:31.637
They turned an old phone booth
into a tiny dance club.

08:31.637 --> 08:34.681
- That sounds fun.
- Three of our patrons got stuck inside.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.767
- Yikes.
- But then two fell in love.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.852
But then the other one perished.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.898
In an unrelated incident.
Anyway, right this way.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.860
Okay, this is our patience podium.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.446
We refer to every group that comes in
as a "party,"

08:49.446 --> 08:50.948
so they feel like they're fun.

08:50.948 --> 08:52.908
If there's a wait,
we give them one of these.

08:53.659 --> 08:56.745
It buzzes when their table's ready.
Also relieves tension headaches.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.789
This is where we keep our mild poison.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.332
Our poison pourers guard the bottles,

09:00.332 --> 09:03.418
mix the liquids and tell patrons
when to stop getting sloppy.

09:03.919 --> 09:06.004
I'm more of a poison sommelier.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.006
The bar is also the designated area

09:08.006 --> 09:10.509
for single beings to attempt
to connect with each other

09:10.509 --> 09:13.554
in the hopes of future mouth pushing
or domestic stability.

09:13.554 --> 09:16.056
It's fun to watch them
whether it's going well or not,

09:16.056 --> 09:17.891
but especially when it's not.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.444
We also have a fizz liquid shooter.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.530
Here, try it. But aim it away from us,

09:31.530 --> 09:33.282
like maybe over--

09:35.742 --> 09:37.661
Let's head to the kitchen.

09:37.661 --> 09:38.871
Lots to see there.

09:39.705 --> 09:43.208
Yes, the kitchen.
The beating blood pump of any restaurant.

09:43.709 --> 09:45.460
So you know your way around a kitchen.

09:45.460 --> 09:48.922
Of course.
Here is the sustenance preserver.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.550
- That's the plate cleaner.
- Must be a modern unit.

09:51.550 --> 09:54.386
- It's been here as long as I have.
- And this must be the sizzle maker.

09:54.386 --> 09:57.556
The heat blaster.
Okay, let's start from the top.

09:57.556 --> 10:01.143
Sustenance goes on plates,
plates go on trays, trays go on limbs.

10:01.143 --> 10:06.190
We use the stacking system here.
Stack. Stack. Stack. Photo booth.

10:06.190 --> 10:08.817
We do not nap in there,
despite wanting to.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.069
Someone's in here.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.946
You can write down a patron's order,

10:12.946 --> 10:15.199
but it's more suspenseful
for them if you memorize it.

10:16.867 --> 10:18.994
You know when you see your order
coming towards you,

10:18.994 --> 10:20.495
but it's really for someone else?

10:20.495 --> 10:23.540
We prevent that with set paths
and tray domes.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.710
- There's old stuff on the walls.
- I've seen that in lots of restaurants.

10:26.710 --> 10:28.045
Why is it that--

10:28.045 --> 10:30.255
Because nostalgia makes food taste better.

10:31.924 --> 10:33.300
Are you joining the tour?

10:33.300 --> 10:35.552
Thanks so much. I'd love to.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.137
Next up, my house.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.601
Did anyone mention to you

10:42.601 --> 10:44.811
that the restaurant has been
slowly drifting down the cliff?

10:44.811 --> 10:46.104
Maybe.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.482
We had it all assessed.
Or rather, the city did.

10:48.482 --> 10:53.111
Sure, yes. When I took over, I thought,
"Oh, Lorb, this won't end well."

10:53.111 --> 10:57.282
But that was many revolutions ago.
Our patrons no longer wear life vests.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.952
You can if you like.
There's tons in the supply closet.

11:00.536 --> 11:03.830
At my insistence, the city sends
their best structural engineers

11:03.830 --> 11:05.832
to give us the all clear every few months.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.377
The current one showed up yesterday
and has just been measuring stuff

11:08.377 --> 11:10.504
and frowning for hours, like they all do.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.048
Perhaps talking with them
will placate your nerves.

11:13.048 --> 11:14.842
Here you go. It's all yours.

11:16.510 --> 11:19.263
Thanks. Perfect fit. Hand holes.

11:21.932 --> 11:24.601
Apologies, I don't wish
to disrupt your work.

11:24.601 --> 11:27.521
I just wanted to introduce you
to this curious being

11:28.021 --> 11:31.358
who has some safety questions
I felt ill-equipped to answer.

11:34.069 --> 11:36.864
Well, not sure I have any good news
for you on the safety front.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.866
The danger to this place
should concern you.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.285
It does. But it's always the same warning.

11:41.285 --> 11:45.497
It's practically reassuring at this point.
The restaurant might fall off the cliff.

11:45.497 --> 11:46.957
Yeah, sorry, it's gonna plummet.

11:46.957 --> 11:50.085
- What?
- Sure, in, like, 20 revolutions.

11:50.085 --> 11:52.004
Well, that at least gives us
enough time to--

11:52.004 --> 11:55.007
No. It's way more likely
that it'll fall on Double Shadow Day

11:55.007 --> 11:56.717
because the moons control the tides

11:56.717 --> 11:58.635
which affects the tectonic shelves
and all that.

12:00.137 --> 12:03.265
Sorry, this Double Shadow Day?
This revolution?

12:04.433 --> 12:06.602
Do you know if the kitchen's
still dealing with that lunch rush?

12:06.602 --> 12:08.353
I'm thinking of getting
a triple-starch bowl.

12:08.353 --> 12:11.607
How can you think about that right now?
We're all gonna perish in the void.

12:11.607 --> 12:12.816
There's no need to worry.

12:12.816 --> 12:15.986
I have a plan to reinforce the foundation
in a way that'll work better

12:15.986 --> 12:19.031
than this tape-and-spit situation
you have going on right now.

12:19.615 --> 12:22.117
I did not mean for this encounter
to increase your anxiety.

12:22.117 --> 12:23.952
I don't know if I can
accept employment here.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.787
I am too concerned about perishing.

12:25.787 --> 12:28.874
Plus, I don't think you even want me
to work here.

12:28.874 --> 12:32.336
Well, now that you no longer want to
work here, I want you to work here more.

12:32.336 --> 12:35.714
Isn't that interesting? Playing hard
to get has many advantages.

12:35.714 --> 12:36.798
It does.

12:37.966 --> 12:39.426
Aren't you frightened?

12:39.426 --> 12:42.137
I know you've been doing this a while,
but why stay?

12:42.137 --> 12:43.222
Funny story.

12:43.722 --> 12:46.683
I moved here when I was your age
with a group of student meteorologists

12:46.683 --> 12:48.936
to find out what that fog in the void is.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.438
Things did not go as planned.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.440
- Are you the only survivor?
- What? No.

12:54.024 --> 12:57.778
I see. So, if you're trained
in meteorology--

12:57.778 --> 12:59.655
Why do I work here at all?

13:00.322 --> 13:03.450
Well, turned out I was awful
at meteorology.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.661
Way more guessing than I expected.

13:06.161 --> 13:09.706
But I'm great at other things,
and I ended up really liking the work.

13:10.749 --> 13:11.959
I love this place.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.503
I'm assuming you figured out
what's under the fog?

13:15.379 --> 13:19.508
No, no one knows how far down
it goes or what's at the bottom.

13:19.508 --> 13:21.885
Might be liquid, might be dirt,
might be dreams.

13:22.386 --> 13:24.972
But the point is,
this is a nice place to work.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.933
And you can't beat that view.
Shall we head to the roof?

13:32.521 --> 13:34.064
Have we settled on an attraction?

13:34.064 --> 13:36.400
Not yet. And we're running out of time.

13:36.400 --> 13:39.319
- We must decide on the attraction tonight.
- Why?

13:39.319 --> 13:41.697
I've always worked best under pressure.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.366
So, have you learned the ropes yet, kid?

13:45.158 --> 13:49.037
I think I learned some,
but I'm sure there are more to grasp.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.998
They know nothing of
restaurant management,

13:51.540 --> 13:53.250
but they are pleasant to be around.

13:53.250 --> 13:54.543
Gratitude.

13:55.127 --> 13:58.922
If you can think of an idea
for the attraction, I'll give you a raise.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.757
Seriously? What if I think of one?

14:01.925 --> 14:03.760
I'm gonna go check on my patrons again.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.053
See ya.

14:10.934 --> 14:13.812
I can't help but notice that you keep
stealing glances at the regular customer.

14:13.812 --> 14:15.272
Am I being too obvious?

14:15.272 --> 14:17.649
I don't think they've noticed.
Why don't you go talk to them?

14:17.649 --> 14:20.068
I don't think so.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.945
Why not? They're just a being.

14:21.945 --> 14:25.574
I am not able to open myself up
to other beings quite that easily.

14:25.574 --> 14:27.201
Maybe that's something you can talk about.

14:27.201 --> 14:30.537
- You might have that in common.
- No. Gratitude.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.872
What's the worst that could happen?

14:31.872 --> 14:34.708
In the weeks leading up
to Double Shadow Day,

14:34.708 --> 14:36.293
anything is possible.

14:36.293 --> 14:39.588
- Is that really a thing?
- I did not used to think so, but right now

14:39.588 --> 14:41.590
it seems like an excuse
that could work in my favor.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.175
It's fun to take risks.

14:43.175 --> 14:45.427
If that's not deception,
then don't you think

14:45.427 --> 14:47.638
you should risk falling
into the void and work here?

14:47.638 --> 14:49.932
I could not possibly make
that type of decision in the weeks

14:49.932 --> 14:51.141
before Double Shadow Day.

14:51.141 --> 14:53.852
How about this? If I take the job,
will you go over there?

14:55.187 --> 14:56.230
How about a half step?

14:59.149 --> 15:00.692
Will you bring this to them?

15:06.198 --> 15:10.827
Apologies. I have some
leftover mush stuck in my mouthstones.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.746
No apology necessary
for good oral hygiene,

15:12.746 --> 15:14.790
though I do not need
to hear too much about it.

15:15.749 --> 15:19.586
I'll take your currency
whenever you're ready.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.506
I think that's what I say.
I've never done this before.

15:22.506 --> 15:23.841
Gratitude.

15:26.844 --> 15:28.428
<i>Sorry I didn't reply yesterday.</i>

15:28.428 --> 15:30.264
<i>I'm really bad at this stuff.</i>

15:30.264 --> 15:33.725
<i>I just wanted to say that I don't
not like you.</i>

15:34.226 --> 15:35.310
<i>The management.</i>

15:38.564 --> 15:40.816
See? Easy.

15:41.316 --> 15:42.442
Yes, you're right.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.695
I always think it's important
not to make large mountains

15:44.695 --> 15:46.321
out of mini crawling insect hills.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.448
In the grand scheme of the orb,
we're specks.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.242
And when we see ourselves that way,

15:50.242 --> 15:53.579
we can better appreciate
our own experiences,

15:53.579 --> 15:57.374
as well as how magical
the orb actually is.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.126
Oh, my Lorb.

16:01.170 --> 16:02.963
I know what this revolution's attraction
should be.

16:03.839 --> 16:05.215
A tiny ice-skating rink?

16:05.215 --> 16:07.217
No, something a little more meaningful.

16:07.217 --> 16:08.719
Than an ice-skating rink?

16:47.257 --> 16:50.427
It is my honor to present
our brand-new attraction.

16:53.972 --> 16:54.973
A telescope.

16:56.058 --> 16:59.436
And it's pointed at our two moons,
Lorb and Rorb,

16:59.436 --> 17:01.897
all ready for Double Shadow Day.

17:01.897 --> 17:04.525
I had one of these as a young being.

17:05.567 --> 17:08.403
This might be my favorite attraction.

17:08.403 --> 17:09.946
It was all their idea.

17:09.946 --> 17:13.075
Sometimes, we just need to take
a good look at the giant orb around us

17:13.075 --> 17:16.118
to see what's been right in front
of our eyeholes the entire time.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.373
Plus, you can use it
to search for treasure.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.375
Okay.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.381
I must admit that hiring them
was a good idea,

17:27.381 --> 17:29.758
despite the fact
that they're a terrible server.

17:29.758 --> 17:31.677
I am impressed
that you saw their potential.

17:31.677 --> 17:33.804
Every being has their own strengths.

17:34.304 --> 17:37.850
They may be more creative,
but you are a great manager.

17:37.850 --> 17:42.813
Gratitude. You are a very eccentric owner.

17:42.813 --> 17:46.316
Gratitude.
And I can get even weirder than this.

17:46.316 --> 17:47.401
No need to show me.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.580
Hey. Thanks for sticking around.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.918
Thanks for convincing me to.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.546
I'll admit, the more I think about it,
the more terrified I am

18:07.546 --> 18:09.006
about plummeting into the chasm.

18:09.006 --> 18:13.135
Hey. If we plummet,
we plummet in good company.
