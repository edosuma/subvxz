WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:03.769
Damn it.
How do you spell "boudoir"?

00:03.771 --> 00:05.137
I'm so far off, I'm not
getting the auto-correct.

00:05.139 --> 00:07.339
So which girl are you
texting now, the coffin-maker?

00:07.341 --> 00:08.674
Oh, you're
thinking about Jamie.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.009
Nah, nah.
She kinda disappeared

00:10.011 --> 00:11.443
into her busy season,

00:11.445 --> 00:13.245
so this is Rhonda.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.980
Oh, is this the girl
with the yogurt mouth?

00:14.982 --> 00:16.949
That's Simi Valley Sue.

00:16.951 --> 00:18.918
Rhonda is
Willem Dafoe's assistant.

00:18.920 --> 00:21.020
No, she's n...
Rhonda's the army reservist.

00:21.022 --> 00:22.655
Boy, you are on such a tear

00:22.657 --> 00:23.923
with the ladies, Winston.

00:23.925 --> 00:25.758
(whistles)
Your boy cleanin' up.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.660
Not thinking about Aly.

00:27.662 --> 00:29.662
And Rhonda, you know,
she's cool, man.

00:29.664 --> 00:31.163
I'm having the
most fun with her.

00:31.165 --> 00:32.832
She really keeps
me on my toes.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.500
And y'all know Winston
love being on his toes.

00:34.502 --> 00:35.701
Definitely, definitely.
You know, actually,

00:35.703 --> 00:37.136
she's poppin' by later.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.771
You guys will get to
meet her before the wedding.

00:38.773 --> 00:40.172
Before the... she's coming
to our wedding? Yes.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.273
Winston, you're
gonna bring this

00:41.275 --> 00:42.541
flavor of the month
to our wedding?

00:42.543 --> 00:43.676
Well, I was... She's gonna
be in wedding photos?

00:43.678 --> 00:44.810
Are you kidding me?

00:44.812 --> 00:46.145
Oh, gather round, grandchildren.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.646
Look at Uncle Winston,
and this woman

00:47.648 --> 00:49.982
who is not
Willem Dafoe's assistant.

00:49.984 --> 00:51.951
Well, I am excited
to meet her.

00:51.953 --> 00:53.185
Can you tell us
some basics?

00:53.187 --> 00:55.120
Her-her last name,
her rank...

00:55.122 --> 00:56.388
Yeah, I don't know
any of that stuff.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.224
I've only been on
two dates with her, so...

00:58.226 --> 00:59.525
Two dates, how do
we even know

00:59.527 --> 01:00.993
that she's fighting
for<i> our</i> army?

01:00.995 --> 01:03.829
Hey! Are we looking at the
owner of a new used car?

01:03.831 --> 01:05.898
No. (scoffs) I wish.

01:05.900 --> 01:08.500
Billy from Car County started
playing misogynist bingo

01:08.502 --> 01:10.069
with me as soon
as I walked in the door.

01:10.071 --> 01:11.637
He called me "dollface."

01:11.639 --> 01:13.539
Started pointing out
all the room in the trunk

01:13.541 --> 01:15.007
for my shopping bags.

01:15.009 --> 01:17.309
Then, he explained
four-wheel drive to me.

01:17.311 --> 01:18.644
I don't need
four-wheel drive explained.

01:18.646 --> 01:20.346
It's very well named.

01:20.348 --> 01:21.914
Like World Series of Poker
champion, Chris Moneymaker.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.415
Continue, though.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.017
Okay, you know how you
get back at this guy?

01:25.019 --> 01:27.386
Huh. You do the entire
thing online.

01:27.388 --> 01:28.988
You set up an
e-mail address,

01:28.990 --> 01:31.023
but under a dude's name.

01:31.025 --> 01:32.892
Yes. I love it.

01:32.894 --> 01:34.059
Help! Help!

01:34.061 --> 01:35.861
There's some lunatic after me!
(yelling)

01:35.863 --> 01:37.029
Oh, my God!
Call 911!

01:37.031 --> 01:38.097
Call 911!

01:38.099 --> 01:39.431
Please, somebody help me.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.600
(everyone yelling at once)
Winston! Winston, go...!

01:41.602 --> 01:43.269
JESS: Oh, my God!
Stay there! Wait!

01:43.271 --> 01:44.570
Don't pull it out.

01:44.572 --> 01:47.106
(laughing)

01:49.076 --> 01:50.276
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

01:51.245 --> 01:54.013
(both laughing)

01:54.015 --> 01:56.181
You just got Rhonda'd.

01:56.183 --> 01:57.182
(laughing)

01:57.184 --> 01:58.450
Rhonda'd!

01:58.452 --> 02:00.686
(Rhonda and Winston
laughing)

02:00.688 --> 02:02.922
What's your last name?

02:02.924 --> 02:05.024
♪ ♪

02:07.929 --> 02:11.263
I'm almost done with my
"Jeff Day" e-mail to the dealer.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.432
I've constructed
a very rich back story for him.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.234
Listen to this, listen to this.
Okay.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.403
He wrote this while
on break from his job,

02:17.405 --> 02:19.371
which is hanging telephone line.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.206
He should have
a desk job by now,

02:21.208 --> 02:23.108
but the ground has always
been trouble for him.

02:23.110 --> 02:25.744
Yeah, the poles are safer.

02:25.746 --> 02:28.547
And sometimes, at dusk,
he can see his buddies

02:28.549 --> 02:31.050
from Desert Storm
dancing in the static.

02:31.052 --> 02:32.718
That's beautiful.
Yeah, it's okay.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.054
So you need a dude pass
before you send it off, right?

02:35.056 --> 02:36.088
No, I don't need
a dude pass.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.256
No, no.
Listen to this.

02:37.258 --> 02:40.059
My wife is on my nuts.

02:40.061 --> 02:41.727
I need two grand off the MSRP.

02:41.729 --> 02:42.962
Go, Clips.

02:42.964 --> 02:44.330
Go, Clips! Good, yeah.
Hey, Nick,

02:44.332 --> 02:46.098
if anyone's gonna
give Jess a dude pass,

02:46.100 --> 02:47.900
it's gonna be me.

02:47.902 --> 02:48.968
A<i> dude</i> pass.

02:48.970 --> 02:50.436
Not a pretty-boy pass.

02:50.438 --> 02:54.073
Not a "I make my money
from my mind" pass.

02:54.075 --> 02:57.343
Not a "I look like the cute
benchwarmer on an NBA team,

02:57.345 --> 02:59.078
"but I'm not good
enough to play."

02:59.080 --> 03:00.846
Are you done? After I
take my dude pass,

03:00.848 --> 03:02.414
why don't you take
a short guy pass?

03:02.416 --> 03:04.984
Why don't you take
a snake voice pass?

03:04.986 --> 03:06.652
Is it frustrating for you
when you go to concerts

03:06.654 --> 03:08.153
and you can't see the stage
'cause you're so short?

03:08.155 --> 03:09.355
It can be.

03:09.357 --> 03:11.690
It<i> can</i> be!

03:11.692 --> 03:13.926
I know we're in
an awkward situation.

03:13.928 --> 03:16.495
I used to date Nick,
now I'm dating Sam, again.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.664
I thought we were
over all this.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.032
And now every time
I turn around,

03:20.034 --> 03:21.800
you guys are
in some kind of turf war.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.036
Are we in a turf war?
I didn't even notice, you punk.

03:24.038 --> 03:25.537
This can't go on forever.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.972
Let's just get
our emotions out there.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.273
Let's just express ourselves...

03:28.275 --> 03:29.441
I'm good. I don't...

03:29.443 --> 03:30.609
I got nothing.
Yeah, I mean, everything's fine.

03:30.611 --> 03:31.443
You feel good?
Yeah, I feel great.

03:31.445 --> 03:32.845
You feel good,
I feel good.

03:32.847 --> 03:33.846
Yeah, I got nothing to talk about, yeah.
We're good, man.

03:33.848 --> 03:35.447
I don't feel nothin'
towards you man.

03:35.449 --> 03:38.350
You can spit on the
bottom of my shoe, dude.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.452
(Winston laughing)

03:40.454 --> 03:42.221
Let's...

03:42.223 --> 03:44.523
SCHMIDT: This is what you
want for our nuptials?

03:44.525 --> 03:46.125
Shenanigans?

03:46.127 --> 03:47.359
This is our wedding, Cece,

03:47.361 --> 03:49.395
not "Ernest Goes
to Our Wedding."

03:49.397 --> 03:51.296
Can't we just revoke
Winston's plus one?

03:51.298 --> 03:52.831
Okay, look, I'm sure
there's more to Rhonda

03:52.833 --> 03:54.800
than just pranks,
all right?

03:54.802 --> 03:57.669
We owe it to Winston
to get to know her.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.371
Well, let's start
at the beginning.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.473
Tell us about your childhood.
Where'd you grow up?

04:01.475 --> 04:03.976
Well, I grew up in Baltimore.
Oh.

04:03.978 --> 04:05.711
I don't like to
talk about it

04:05.713 --> 04:07.312
around new people,

04:07.314 --> 04:09.014
but we were homeless.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.983
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.

04:10.985 --> 04:12.184
I had no idea.

04:12.186 --> 04:13.252
It was tough.

04:13.254 --> 04:15.320
We didn't have money

04:15.322 --> 04:18.190
for food, clothes, toys.

04:18.192 --> 04:21.093
My brother and I adopted a rat.

04:21.095 --> 04:24.029
I remember, we called
the rat Singular Wireless.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.165
He was sweet.

04:26.167 --> 04:28.434
Until he ate my brother's
pinkie toe clean off.

04:28.436 --> 04:30.536
(quietly):
What?

04:30.538 --> 04:31.770
He bit it like a baby carrot.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.872
Just (snapping).

04:33.874 --> 04:35.107
It woke me up.

04:35.109 --> 04:37.276
That snap, that snap.

04:37.278 --> 04:38.377
In the end,
we laughed about it,

04:38.379 --> 04:39.611
'cause what else can you do?

04:39.613 --> 04:41.880
Just Singular being Singular.

04:41.882 --> 04:42.881
Gosh darn it.

04:42.883 --> 04:43.749
(sighing)

04:43.751 --> 04:45.184
He ran away
after a while--

04:45.186 --> 04:47.553
my brother, not the rat--

04:47.555 --> 04:50.589
he didn't get far,
obviously, not with nine toes.

04:50.591 --> 04:54.626
Listen, it wasn't
a great childhood,

04:54.628 --> 04:56.261
and I know that
I come on strong,

04:56.263 --> 04:58.597
but I guess, if I can

04:58.599 --> 05:01.066
scare people with my pranks,

05:01.068 --> 05:05.270
then I know I'm not the
only one who's scared.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.439
What a cruel, terrible
world we live in.

05:07.441 --> 05:10.442
I had no idea.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.910
I'm so, so, so, sorry.

05:11.912 --> 05:15.080
(both guffawing)

05:15.082 --> 05:16.415
You're stupid, Schmidt.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.150
And you're-you're
stupid, too, Cece,

05:18.152 --> 05:19.818
Stupid.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.953
Okay, wait,
so the en... the en...

05:20.955 --> 05:22.721
the entire
story is a lie?

05:22.723 --> 05:25.390
Rhon. Da'd.

05:25.392 --> 05:26.458
Pow-pow.

05:29.130 --> 05:31.163
Need a little more of this.

05:31.165 --> 05:32.764
Anybody else
want some, uh, wine?

05:32.766 --> 05:33.999
Oh, no, thanks.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.834
I salted it.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.402
(Rhonda guffaws)

05:37.404 --> 05:39.104
You salted the wine?
How is that even a prank?

05:39.106 --> 05:41.673
You just told her that you
salted it before she took a sip.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.977
Unless of course that the prank
is that there's no salt in it.

05:48.349 --> 05:49.348
(spits)

05:49.350 --> 05:50.782
(guffawing)

05:50.784 --> 05:52.351
Yes, there's salt.

05:52.353 --> 05:54.019
There's most
definitely salt in that.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.621
(laughing)

05:55.623 --> 05:57.523
This is delightful.

05:58.826 --> 06:02.327
Mr. Day, I, too,
love<i> Sons of Anarchy.</i>

06:02.329 --> 06:03.762
You drive a pretty hard bargain.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.497
I agree to your terms!

06:05.499 --> 06:09.635
You just have to sign
the papers in person.

06:09.637 --> 06:12.337
I'm at the dealership
for another hour.

06:12.339 --> 06:14.940
Ah, I did not
think this through.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.208
(sighing, groaning)

06:16.210 --> 06:18.844
Nick... I have hit
a snag in my car buying.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.779
I'm not surprised
you came to me.

06:20.781 --> 06:23.615
I heard you and, uh,
Dr. Trap-Jaw last night,

06:23.617 --> 06:25.484
and he climaxes like a woman.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.718
That was me.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.221
Then you sound like
a woman when you climax.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.123
I am a woman.
What's your point?

06:31.125 --> 06:32.291
We're still on your point.

06:32.293 --> 06:33.659
I'm waiting for you
to wrap it up.

06:33.661 --> 06:34.960
My point is...

06:34.962 --> 06:36.962
your car deal went south,
and so you need Nick Miller

06:36.964 --> 06:38.564
to twist some nips
for you, yeah?

06:38.566 --> 06:40.399
Nope. The nips have
already been twisted.

06:40.401 --> 06:42.868
All I need right now is someone
to pretend to be Jeff Day.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.404
And I would ask Sam, but he's
in a procedure all day.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.739
He's de-webbing
some kid's toes.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.008
It sounds whimsical, but
it's actually very serious.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.176
Why would you go to him?

06:51.178 --> 06:53.679
He cannot close
this deal for you, Jess.

06:53.681 --> 06:55.514
The deal has
already been closed.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.849
Right now, I just need,
literally, any man.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.051
(chuckling)
If I could wish

06:59.053 --> 07:01.019
a mannequin to life, I would.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.187
(both laughing)

07:02.189 --> 07:03.889
Oh, Jessica.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.858
You understand that fate fused
that kid's toes together.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.094
And Dr. Sam is
the man for that job,

07:09.096 --> 07:10.562
but I'm the man for this job.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.863
So if you excuse me,

07:11.865 --> 07:13.532
let me get my Julius
Pepperwood disguise.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.900
Wait, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.535
I just need you
to pretend to be Jeff Day.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.537
Well, I need some sort of disguise.
Absolutely not.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.905
What about a mustache?
That's a disguise.

07:19.907 --> 07:22.074
Not if I grow one. We're
in the car in ten minutes.

07:22.076 --> 07:23.909
You gonna grow a
mustache in ten minutes?

07:23.911 --> 07:26.245
No man could do that.

07:26.247 --> 07:28.080
Scientifically impossible.

07:28.082 --> 07:30.349
Hey, I guess science
always wins, right?

07:30.351 --> 07:32.284
See ya in the car.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.919
JESS:
All right, now remember,

07:33.921 --> 07:35.854
Jeff Day is
a lovable schnook,

07:35.856 --> 07:37.589
who makes sausage
in his spare time.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.258
You work for
the phone company,

07:39.260 --> 07:40.792
so you call
the phones "units."

07:40.794 --> 07:42.594
All right,
what's my back story?

07:42.596 --> 07:43.962
Units, that's good.
Uh, you're my wife.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.697
You spend all day
making sausages,

07:45.699 --> 07:47.766
and clucking with the other
hens on the kitchen unit.

07:47.768 --> 07:51.470
No, no. I'm a disgraced
ice-skating sensation.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.272
I got ex-communicated
from the sport

07:53.274 --> 07:55.374
for protesting
that nudie fabric.

07:55.376 --> 07:56.642
And then I broke my butt.

07:56.644 --> 07:57.876
Right, and which toe is webbed?

07:57.878 --> 07:59.711
Ugh, Nick,
that's real life.

07:59.713 --> 08:00.946
Ugh. This is gonna
be a disaster.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.114
Abort, abort.

08:02.116 --> 08:03.081
Dollface!

08:03.083 --> 08:04.116
You're back!

08:04.118 --> 08:05.817
Hi. I am, I am.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.085
Um, I believe
you've been e-mailing

08:07.087 --> 08:08.320
with my husband Jeff.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.588
Jeff Day.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.457
Lover of meats,
enemy of nonsense.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.159
Put her there.
(laughs)

08:14.161 --> 08:16.061
Nice mustache.
My guy.

08:21.135 --> 08:22.134
SCHMIDT: All right!
(cell phone rings)

08:22.136 --> 08:23.468
Oh, excuse me for a minute.

08:23.470 --> 08:24.936
I have to go feed the meter.

08:24.938 --> 08:27.339
Uh, excu... before you go,

08:27.341 --> 08:28.674
can you please fill us in

08:28.676 --> 08:30.842
on all active pranks
at this table?

08:30.844 --> 08:32.177
I think you found
them all, okay?

08:32.179 --> 08:33.178
Relax.

08:33.180 --> 08:36.581
Oh, wait! Winston...

08:36.583 --> 08:38.984
I put a watch battery
in your huevos rancheros.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.519
(Rhonda laughs)

08:40.521 --> 08:41.520
In the huevos?

08:41.522 --> 08:43.588
No, you did not.

08:43.590 --> 08:45.757
Winston, she's been
sitting down this whole time.

08:45.759 --> 08:48.093
Does she have someone working
with her in the kitchen?

08:48.095 --> 08:49.795
Can you explain to me
how that's funny?

08:49.797 --> 08:52.130
'Cause you could have cracked
a molar or choked to death.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.265
(laughing)
It's hilarious.

08:53.267 --> 08:54.433
'Cause what if I choke
on the battery?

08:54.435 --> 08:55.600
You know what I mean?

08:55.602 --> 08:57.135
Or if the battery breaks

08:57.137 --> 08:58.437
open inside of me, you know?

08:58.439 --> 09:01.173
and causes all kinds of... no?

09:02.109 --> 09:04.142
What-what?
You guys don't like her?

09:04.144 --> 09:05.277
Mm...
Uh...

09:05.279 --> 09:06.278
And I mean, look, I get it.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.446
She might not be the one,

09:07.448 --> 09:09.147
but come on, at least
we're having fun, right?

09:09.149 --> 09:10.682
We gave her a chance,
okay, Winston?

09:10.684 --> 09:12.484
But I am scared
to touch my food,

09:12.486 --> 09:14.820
and I don't want to feel that
way at our wedding. Yes.

09:14.822 --> 09:15.954
Winston, it brings me no joy

09:15.956 --> 09:17.189
to do this, whatsoever,

09:17.191 --> 09:18.623
but I'm revoking
your plus one.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.325
You gave me that plus one,

09:20.327 --> 09:21.827
which means I can bring anyone.

09:21.829 --> 09:23.962
Plus one means plus anyone.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.464
For the
Schmidt-Parikh wedding,

09:25.466 --> 09:27.165
it's a plus<i> the</i> one.

09:27.167 --> 09:29.234
You just had that one
locked and loaded, didn't you?

09:29.236 --> 09:31.002
Excuse me, sir? Here's your check.
Oh, my God!

09:31.004 --> 09:32.504
That's my face.
Why is that my face?

09:32.506 --> 09:33.805
Ha-ha!

09:33.807 --> 09:35.407
(laughing)
WINSTON: No, no, no, no.

09:35.409 --> 09:37.209
Save it.

09:37.211 --> 09:39.010
It's gonna be wasted
on these two.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.179
Let's get out of here.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.782
How did she get
a mask of my face?

09:45.018 --> 09:47.719
Oh... (scoffs) did they just
stick us with the bill?

09:47.721 --> 09:49.654
N... no.

09:49.656 --> 09:52.057
She left, like, $300.

09:52.059 --> 09:54.025
Who does<i> this</i> prank?

09:54.027 --> 09:55.360
Thanks for meeting with us.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.329
I don't know...
what made me think

09:57.331 --> 10:00.232
I could have possibly
bought a car by myself.

10:00.234 --> 10:01.867
You were right to get
your hubby involved.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.268
Now, Mr. Day,

10:03.270 --> 10:05.537
your mind seemed
pretty made up over e-mail.

10:05.539 --> 10:07.839
Look, Billy, I wish, uh,
we could get twin hogs,

10:07.841 --> 10:09.574
but then the missus
would stop giving me

10:09.576 --> 10:11.276
that sweet potato pie.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.611
You know Jeff Day,

10:12.613 --> 10:14.780
I need my sweet potato pie
every four hours.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.081
Ain't that right, baby?

10:16.083 --> 10:17.582
I married a hungry man.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.084
BILLY: If you're open
to other options,

10:19.086 --> 10:20.752
we just got a
consignment of vehicles

10:20.754 --> 10:22.053
that we are looking to move

10:22.055 --> 10:23.555
at rock bottom prices.

10:23.557 --> 10:26.024
I had my heart set
on that cute little car

10:26.026 --> 10:27.592
that you showed me
in that e-mail you wrote.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.094
(chuckles)

10:29.096 --> 10:32.564
Had a really big makeup mirror,
and I sure was excited about it.

10:32.566 --> 10:34.366
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, buh-buh...

10:34.368 --> 10:36.701
There's no harm in hearing what
the catch of the day is, right?

10:36.703 --> 10:38.069
No harm.
Exactly.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.105
Billy, Jeff needs to
take his omega-3 pill.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.773
Could you grab us a glass of water?
Not a problem.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.108
I got a bad ticker myself.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.776
Not... uh...

10:46.246 --> 10:47.579
I had him right
where I wanted him.

10:47.581 --> 10:48.947
He's trying to
bait and switch us,

10:48.949 --> 10:50.415
and you're gobbling it up
like an old king

10:50.417 --> 10:51.883
with a turkey leg.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.952
You're leaving money
on the table.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.554
I can smell it.

10:55.556 --> 10:57.122
Watch. I'm gonna
string him along,

10:57.124 --> 10:58.824
and then I'm going to
get you a better deal.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.459
He thinks he's fishing for me.

11:00.461 --> 11:03.995
Nah, I'm fishing for him,
but<i> from</i> the water.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.263
You're in way over your head.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.499
Right where a fish wants to be.

11:07.501 --> 11:09.267
Here's your water, and...

11:09.269 --> 11:12.003
take as many mouse pads
as you want.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.005
Quit stalling me.
Smart.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.841
Tell me about the
secret stash, Billy.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.075
These vehicles are a lot bigger

11:17.077 --> 11:18.310
than what you were
e-mailing about.

11:18.312 --> 11:20.111
Well, a car can
never be too big,

11:20.113 --> 11:22.080
and a pot can
never be too sweet.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.248
(mouthing)

11:23.250 --> 11:24.749
I hear ya, so I guess,

11:24.751 --> 11:25.984
don't waste your time
with anything smaller

11:25.986 --> 11:27.752
than a two liter?
Two liter?

11:27.754 --> 11:29.621
I want a car,
not a Mountain Dew.

11:29.623 --> 11:32.491
(all laughing)

11:32.493 --> 11:34.359
You want to send this girl
out on to the road

11:34.361 --> 11:36.328
with a little bulk,
in case she gets hit,

11:36.330 --> 11:38.864
or more likely, hits someone,
am I right? (laughs)

11:38.866 --> 11:41.266
While she's text messaging.
They can't stop.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.201
They're beautiful,
but... (boinging)

11:43.203 --> 11:44.503
(laughing):
I like you.

11:44.505 --> 11:46.505
Honey, don't forget how
much research you put in.

11:46.507 --> 11:48.106
You don't want to
throw that all away,

11:48.108 --> 11:49.808
like I did
with my skating career.

11:49.810 --> 11:51.276
Jeff, you clearly know
your way around an engine.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.478
What are we talkin', 5.0?

11:53.480 --> 11:55.647
You want the bird to sing
in my underpants,

11:55.649 --> 11:56.681
I'm gonna need double digits.

11:56.683 --> 11:57.949
Oh, yeah,
Jeff.

11:57.951 --> 11:58.817
baby!

11:58.819 --> 11:59.718
Oh, yeah.

11:59.720 --> 12:00.719
Yeah!

12:00.721 --> 12:02.387
It's gonna sing.
Boom.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.122
(cell phone chiming)
You get me.

12:04.124 --> 12:06.691
(Billy and Nick laughing,
making goofy noises)

12:06.693 --> 12:08.727
Excuse me.
I have to take this.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.829
It's Oksana Baiul.
Honey, get the car I want,

12:10.831 --> 12:13.298
or the only pie you'll be eating
is out of the garbage.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.366
(laughs)

12:15.402 --> 12:17.035
Hey, I thought you
were de-webbing.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.670
Well, it took less time
than I thought.

12:18.672 --> 12:20.171
Yeah, he only wanted
his big toe free,

12:20.173 --> 12:21.640
so he could wear flip-flops.

12:21.642 --> 12:22.574
How's the new car?
Ugh!

12:22.576 --> 12:24.376
Don't make
a thing out of it,

12:24.378 --> 12:26.678
but I had to ask Nick
to be Jeff Day.

12:26.680 --> 12:27.979
You asked Nick for help,
not me?

12:27.981 --> 12:29.381
Well, you were in surgery,

12:29.383 --> 12:30.682
and he was the only person
I could find,

12:30.684 --> 12:32.384
but he's screwing it up so much

12:32.386 --> 12:34.819
that I really wish
I'd "Reverse-Tootsie'd."

12:34.821 --> 12:37.255
Of course he's screwing up.
He's a little human porkchop.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.224
I'm on my way. Wait, don't come.
Don't come.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.492
I could be Jeff Day.

12:40.494 --> 12:41.826
I just need to find
a fake mustache.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.328
What is it with you guys
and mustaches?

12:43.330 --> 12:45.230
Look, I have the situation
un-under control.

12:49.336 --> 12:52.404
Cutting Winston's plus one
creates a real ripple effect.

12:52.406 --> 12:54.039
Jason gets bumped from 14.

12:54.041 --> 12:55.574
Ruthie gets bumped from 6,

12:55.576 --> 12:57.842
landing Tyler right
next to the bar,

12:57.844 --> 12:59.578
which feels like tempting fate.

12:59.580 --> 13:01.179
Yeah, you know what?
The more I think about it,

13:01.181 --> 13:03.782
we may have judged Rhonda
a little too harshly.

13:03.784 --> 13:05.083
Maybe you're right.
You know what?

13:05.085 --> 13:07.118
If Winston is happy,
with Lady Kutcher,

13:07.120 --> 13:08.853
we should support him.

13:08.855 --> 13:10.455
What's the worst
that can happen?

13:10.457 --> 13:13.391
Maybe she'll put some cellophane
over the toilet bowls.

13:13.393 --> 13:16.127
Hopefully, my Uncle Randy
doesn't get

13:16.129 --> 13:18.263
(door opens, closes)
fired up at the buffet.

13:18.865 --> 13:20.865
Hey, guys.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.568
We were just talking,
and we're sorry about earlier.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.070
Oh, listen, I've been thinking

13:25.072 --> 13:26.905
about what you said,
and maybe you're right.

13:26.907 --> 13:29.474
I want the woman that I bring
to your wedding to be special.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.476
Special like...

13:31.478 --> 13:33.745
my wife.

13:33.747 --> 13:35.814
(laughing)

13:35.816 --> 13:38.783
BOTH:
We got married!

13:38.785 --> 13:41.052
(laughing)

13:41.054 --> 13:42.120
What?!

13:49.496 --> 13:51.096
You got married?
Well, look, you guys said

13:51.098 --> 13:52.597
to be more serious,

13:52.599 --> 13:55.433
and nothing's more serious
than holy matrimony.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.402
I mean, this is what
you guys wanted, right?

13:57.404 --> 13:58.937
No! No! This is insane.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.272
And we were totally out of
bounds in the first place.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.841
We never should
have interfered

14:02.843 --> 14:04.109
in your love life.
No.

14:04.111 --> 14:05.410
Got you again!
Boom!

14:05.412 --> 14:06.578
That's what we
needed to hear.

14:06.580 --> 14:09.414
Huh? Wait. What?

14:09.416 --> 14:10.415
What, so you...
wait a minute.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.516
You're not
actually married?

14:11.518 --> 14:12.851
(laughing)

14:12.853 --> 14:13.985
Oh, thank...
thank goodness.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.186
It was...
it was just a prank.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.188
It was just a prank.
Just a prank.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.025
Okay. How did you guys get such a
realistic marriage certificate?

14:20.027 --> 14:21.359
Does it look realistic?

14:21.361 --> 14:22.694
Oh, that's good.
They did a good job on it,

14:22.696 --> 14:24.162
'cause it's
a hundred percent real.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.964
We got you.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.932
We found a
same-day chapel,

14:27.934 --> 14:29.467
and then we got married,

14:29.469 --> 14:30.769
as a prank.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.107
Wha-uh...? So-so you
really did get married?

14:36.109 --> 14:37.342
Y'all can't keep up.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.678
How is really getting
married, Winston, a prank?

14:39.680 --> 14:41.346
The authenticity
of the marriage

14:41.348 --> 14:43.148
is what makes it
a great prank.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.783
Come on, guys.
Yeah.

14:44.785 --> 14:46.051
Says who? Hold on. wh...
no, please.

14:46.053 --> 14:47.886
Let them explain.
Please explain.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.621
We've already explained it.

14:49.623 --> 14:53.291
A simple prank
is a strong prank.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.460
Uh-huh.
Okay.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.629
Let's just say...
I don't know,

14:57.631 --> 14:59.698
I told you that I cut
my pinkie finger off,

14:59.700 --> 15:02.200
and then I actually cut
my pinkie finger off.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.702
RHONDA: Mm.

15:03.704 --> 15:05.203
Is that a prank?
Is that a prank?

15:05.205 --> 15:06.538
Well, I would not
see that coming.

15:06.540 --> 15:08.339
Okay.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.841
Different direction.

15:09.843 --> 15:11.976
Let-let's say
that I-I told you

15:11.978 --> 15:13.378
that I invested
all of my money

15:13.380 --> 15:14.746
into boogie boards.

15:14.748 --> 15:15.747
That's just a lie.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.415
And then I took you

15:17.417 --> 15:18.883
to my accountant's office,

15:18.885 --> 15:20.251
and sitting
behind the desk

15:20.253 --> 15:22.887
was just a little
crab in sunglasses.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.589
Hmm, still sounds
like a lie.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.525
And then my real
accountant came out

15:27.527 --> 15:29.394
and showed you the books

15:29.396 --> 15:31.329
and, in fact,
I had invested

15:31.331 --> 15:33.898
all of money in boogie boards.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.533
That's definitely a prank.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.335
Yeah, that would get me.
That's-that's a good one.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.570
That's crazy, yeah.
That's a good one.

15:38.572 --> 15:39.838
RHONDA: That's a good one.
I don't understand this.

15:39.840 --> 15:41.940
Okay, so this is like
a lifelong prank?

15:41.942 --> 15:43.608
Oh, no, no, we're getting
it annulled tomorrow.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.376
Oh, right.
RHONDA: Tonight's the honeymoon.

15:45.378 --> 15:46.945
Listen, a little
marriage advice--

15:46.947 --> 15:48.913
I would know
because I'm married--

15:48.915 --> 15:52.717
a happy wife,
uh, a happy life.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.385
Have you heard the saying before?
Mm.

15:54.387 --> 15:57.589
I'm questioning everything right now.
I swear, I swear... I swear...

15:57.591 --> 15:59.057
He's about 5'10".

15:59.059 --> 16:00.725
Maybe a mustache.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.393
Sometimes he just sits in
the bathroom buying music.

16:02.395 --> 16:03.762
Do you think you
could check in there?

16:03.764 --> 16:04.863
Is that him in the RV?
Oh, no.

16:04.865 --> 16:06.598
He wouldn't be in an RV.

16:07.934 --> 16:10.468
He is, he is.
That's him in the RV.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.070
You look natural behind
the wheel of that baby.

16:12.072 --> 16:13.538
I felt like myself for
the first time in my life.

16:13.540 --> 16:14.773
JESS:
Hey, Jeff.

16:14.775 --> 16:16.141
Where were you,

16:16.143 --> 16:17.976
and why weren't you
answering your unit?

16:17.978 --> 16:19.110
Excuse me.
Excu... yeah.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.779
Good stuff, Billy.
Thank you.

16:20.781 --> 16:22.080
Ow.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.281
Is this you
doing your plan?

16:23.283 --> 16:24.482
I don't know.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.884
He keeps changing things up.

16:25.886 --> 16:27.318
He's very good at his job.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.721
Hey, how ya doin'?
I'm Jeff Day.

16:30.457 --> 16:31.456
My brother.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.991
Geoff with a "G."

16:32.993 --> 16:34.492
Yeah, I came as soon as I could.
JESS: I don't know why.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.895
I explicitly told you not to.

16:36.897 --> 16:38.730
NICK: Yeah, why don't you take
a hike? No one needs you here.

16:38.732 --> 16:40.064
The reason she
came to me first.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.299
Sorry, Billy.

16:41.301 --> 16:42.500
There's a little bit
of bad blood

16:42.502 --> 16:43.935
between my brother
and my husband.

16:43.937 --> 16:45.236
She may have come
to you for help,

16:45.238 --> 16:46.805
but you're clearly not
getting the job done,

16:46.807 --> 16:48.673
which is why she'll always
come back for my help.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.175
As soon as you get
a helping of my help,

16:50.177 --> 16:51.409
you're never the same.
No one helps

16:51.411 --> 16:53.244
me better than I help myself.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.579
I told you if you'd
just guide me.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.080
Let's not get into that now.

16:56.082 --> 16:57.816
I don't really know what
you guys are talking about,

16:57.818 --> 16:59.117
but are you still buying the RV?

16:59.119 --> 17:01.152
No! I'm not buying an RV.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.821
Honey, he's giving
us a great price.

17:02.823 --> 17:04.989
Why don't you get those numbers?
Don't get those numbers.

17:04.991 --> 17:06.524
Why don't you go get them?
Stay right there.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.093
Why do women always bring
your drama in here?

17:09.095 --> 17:11.129
Oh, you're blaming me?

17:11.131 --> 17:12.997
Hah! All right.

17:12.999 --> 17:16.668
I'd like to test-drive

17:18.972 --> 17:20.471

You're talking to me.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.527
You're really good at this, Jess.
Really good.

18:17.530 --> 18:18.997
Now for you two, jokers.

18:18.999 --> 18:20.765
I'm sorry I went rogue, Jess.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.000
I'm sorry, too.

18:22.002 --> 18:23.067
You told me not
to come, but I did.

18:23.069 --> 18:24.269
Don't apologize to me.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.570
Talk to each other.

18:25.572 --> 18:28.406
Figure out a way to
both be in my life.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.842
Otherwise, I'm gonna
turn the heat up to 90.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.944
I'm gonna turn the
radio to Pink.

18:32.946 --> 18:36.114
And I am going to find
a cobblestone street.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.882
Oh, no, please don't.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.050
Shut up, Billy!

18:39.052 --> 18:40.618
You have a
little boy's name.

18:40.620 --> 18:41.586
You are so mean!

18:41.588 --> 18:42.754
Now solve it.

18:42.756 --> 18:44.055
Deal with your emotions.

18:44.057 --> 18:45.256
Jess, you don't get it.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.125
The stuff between Sam and I
is deep guy stuff.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.426
It's untalkable.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.428
That's right.
I punched him twice.

18:50.430 --> 18:51.896
And I stole his girlfriend.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.198
We're talking about adultery
and violence.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.534
That part of the male brain
has not been civilized.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.469
So you're just gonna
feud forever?

18:58.471 --> 19:00.705
I'll teach my sons
to hate his sons

19:00.707 --> 19:02.473
and I expect the
same from him.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.442
You got it.
Thank you.

19:04.444 --> 19:05.576
If you insist on
hating each other,

19:05.578 --> 19:06.778
do it while I'm not around.

19:06.780 --> 19:08.446
The moment I walk
in the room,

19:08.448 --> 19:09.781
I want some convincing

19:09.783 --> 19:11.783
dude on dude
friendship stuff.

19:11.785 --> 19:13.284
I want high-fives.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.285
I want golf tips.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.254
When a hot
waitress walks by,

19:16.256 --> 19:17.755
I want to see a
real nudge-nudge.

19:17.757 --> 19:18.823
Hubba, hubba.

19:18.825 --> 19:19.958

if he can't do it.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.001
(laughs)

19:30.003 --> 19:31.569
Are you wearing a fake mustache?

19:31.571 --> 19:33.471
Yeah.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.406
Thanks for coming
to my annulment, guys.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.308
Yeah, well, we should get
to know your ex-wife.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.310
Yeah, like, did she make
that mask of my face,

19:39.312 --> 19:41.446
or does she have a mask guy?

19:41.448 --> 19:43.114
Rhonda's in here.

19:43.116 --> 19:44.349
Is it weird that
I'm a little nervous?

19:44.351 --> 19:46.050
Yes.
Yeah.

19:51.758 --> 19:52.991
Rhonda.

19:52.993 --> 19:54.192
Will you make me the most

19:54.194 --> 19:56.327
hilarious man in the world
by being my ex...

19:56.329 --> 19:57.595

19:57.597 --> 19:59.097
Come on! Rhonda's a boy!
Rhonda's a boy!

19:59.099 --> 20:00.264
You ain't Rhonda.

20:00.266 --> 20:01.866
Winston Bishop?
Y-y-yes.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.468
I'm supposed to play you this.

20:03.470 --> 20:05.937
Oh, here we go.

20:05.939 --> 20:09.374
Winston, I think we should
postpone our annulment.

20:09.376 --> 20:14.045
Until you put the pieces
of your mind back together.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.613
(laughing,
imitates shooting gun)

20:15.615 --> 20:18.149
I wish I could see
your face right now.

20:18.151 --> 20:19.484
But I can't,

20:19.486 --> 20:21.019
because I got
called up for duty.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.888
Bye-bye, hubby.

20:25.191 --> 20:28.726
(nervous laugh)
That's...

20:28.728 --> 20:30.294
Wait, so we're still married.

20:30.296 --> 20:31.562
Yeah.

20:31.564 --> 20:34.132
But then how...
but then how you gon...

20:34.134 --> 20:35.500
we were... we were
co-pranksters.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.168
How you gonna prank
your co-prankster?

20:37.170 --> 20:40.638
Hmm... I get it.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.408
I finally get
the prank now, man.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.510
You got Rhonda'd.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.178
I made Billy my baby.

20:47.180 --> 20:49.247
I made that little bitch
a bottle, right guys?

20:49.249 --> 20:51.182
You did a great job, honey.
You did awesome.

20:51.184 --> 20:52.517
What a terrific
hybrid vehicle.

20:52.519 --> 20:53.885
I'm glad that
the previous owner

20:53.887 --> 20:56.421
scraped off all the
"Co-exist" bumper stickers.

20:56.423 --> 20:57.588
So I have no options.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.823
I have no options.
Okay, well...

20:58.825 --> 21:00.558
Sleep with both eyes open,
you idiot.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.193
It's one eye,
you idiot.

21:02.195 --> 21:04.562
Cut your chance in half, you idiot.
Idiot.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.397
Hey, don't bill me for this.

21:06.399 --> 21:09.534
Sorry, that was my divorce lawyer.
What?!

21:09.536 --> 21:11.402
Yeah, it's been a day.
So I got married.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.438
Then my wife was
shipped overseas.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.672
And I remain married.

21:14.674 --> 21:17.508
What? Who? When? How? What?

21:17.510 --> 21:19.677
Yeah, he married Rhonda.
As a prank.

21:19.679 --> 21:22.046
Wait, you're really
married, Winston?

21:22.048 --> 21:24.215
I-I'm not sure
I understand the prank.

21:24.217 --> 21:26.050
The prank is, is that
Winston's on the hook

21:26.052 --> 21:27.518
to send care packages to Germany

21:27.520 --> 21:28.786
for the next six months.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.188
Rhonda'd.

21:30.190 --> 21:31.856
Guys, let's just celebrate

21:31.858 --> 21:33.624
how hilarious my situation is,

21:33.626 --> 21:35.193
