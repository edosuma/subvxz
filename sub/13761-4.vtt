<i>Attention. The Empire has
taken control of the city.</i>

00:20.690 --> 00:24.630
I advise everyone to leave before
more Imperial troops arrive.

00:25.730 --> 00:28.600
Ugh!
Why do they hate us?

00:28.630 --> 00:30.670
Don't take it personal.
It's just part of the job.

00:32.729 --> 00:34.590
Don't let me down, Lobot.

00:34.630 --> 00:38.400
<i>That cargo must not fall
into Imperial hands.</i>

01:09.640 --> 01:11.540
Freeze!

01:31.460 --> 01:34.460
Focus.
You must focus.

01:34.490 --> 01:37.420
This beauty has genuine
Corellian leather seats

01:37.460 --> 01:40.360
and, with only 50 billion light-years,
it's still under warranty.

01:41.430 --> 01:42.800
We can buff that out.

01:44.470 --> 01:47.330
Ugh!
Another sale blown!

01:47.370 --> 01:50.670
It's just a little slump. Something
will come along. It always does.

01:50.740 --> 01:53.740
Oh, it better. Or we'll have
to sell Roger to pay the rent.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.650
- Pardon?
- Sell Roger?

01:55.680 --> 01:58.580
Focus! There is nothing
more important than this.

01:58.620 --> 02:00.690
You must force
the pieces together...

02:00.720 --> 02:02.660
with the, uh, Force.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.590
Not being redundant there.
I have to take this.

02:05.630 --> 02:08.360
Continue your training.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.669
Blast!
I just can't do it.

02:09.699 --> 02:13.440
Ow! You got a reason for
bouncing parts off my tail pipe?

02:13.470 --> 02:18.470
Sorry, Zander. It's just...
this Force stuff is so hard!

02:18.510 --> 02:20.780
- And kicking helps?
- A little.

02:20.810 --> 02:25.650
I just don't want to let Naare down.
This is <i>so</i> important to her.

02:25.680 --> 02:28.620
<i>This is</i> so <i>important to me.</i>

02:28.650 --> 02:32.690
<i>Why haven't you located
more Kyber Saber crystals?</i>

02:32.720 --> 02:35.660
The boy's skills are weak.
He requires training.

02:35.690 --> 02:38.490
<i>Eh... Correct me
if I'm wrong, Naare,</i>

02:38.530 --> 02:43.470
<i>but so far, he's found all the crystals
when you were nowhere near him.</i>

02:43.500 --> 02:45.370
<i>Isn't that right?</i>

02:45.400 --> 02:47.470
Well, yes.
I suppose that's true.

02:47.500 --> 02:52.340
<i>Maybe it's just my Sith nature
that makes me paranoid,</i>

02:52.370 --> 02:54.370
<i>but I wonder...</i>

02:54.410 --> 02:56.780
<i>Instead of you
deceiving the boy,</i>

02:56.810 --> 02:59.820
<i>perhaps it is he
who is deceiving you.</i>

02:59.850 --> 03:02.680
No, I-I'm certain
that is not the case.

03:02.720 --> 03:06.590
<i>Then prove it.
Find those crystals.</i>

03:06.620 --> 03:09.520
<i>I will check your progress
again soon.</i>

03:11.660 --> 03:14.500
<i>Status report! What have you
done since we last spoke?</i>

03:14.530 --> 03:16.370
<i>Hmm?</i>

03:23.500 --> 03:26.730
Maybe you're looking at it
the wrong way.

03:26.770 --> 03:28.770
Maybe you can't force the Force.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.450
- Know what I mean?
- No.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.750
I mean, maybe you should take your
mind off the whole thing for a bit.

03:35.780 --> 03:39.610
Ooh, I know! You should do what
I do whenever I'm feeling down.

03:39.650 --> 03:43.520
Whoo! Podraces!

03:45.690 --> 03:48.620
Did you see that, Rowan?
I didn't see anything.

03:48.660 --> 03:52.620
I know! That BT-310 is blazing fast.
You feel better already, right?

03:52.670 --> 03:55.440
Actually, I kinda
don't know how...

03:55.470 --> 03:57.410
To thank me? No need.
You're my brother.

03:57.440 --> 03:59.410
Just don't tell Kordi
I brought you down here.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.440
She has this thing about the
Lower Ring being dangerous.

04:02.480 --> 04:05.310
Ooh!
I just don't see it.

04:05.350 --> 04:08.320
Aaah!

04:09.720 --> 04:11.620
Ha-ha!
I'm still alive!

04:11.650 --> 04:13.580
Whoo-hoo!

04:13.620 --> 04:16.290
- I'm gonna go take a look around.
- 'Kay, but hurry back.

04:16.320 --> 04:20.519
You don't want to miss the battle lap.
Whoo-hoo! I love podracing!

04:28.540 --> 04:31.370
It's an easy
grab-and-go job.

04:31.400 --> 04:35.300
Data reports indicate Cloud City
is under Imperial lockdown.

04:35.340 --> 04:37.370
Which is why
I can't go back there.

04:37.440 --> 04:40.370
I left some
precious cargo behind,

04:40.410 --> 04:43.740
and I'll pay a small fortune
to whoever retrieves it.

04:43.780 --> 04:47.350
A small fortune? That'd bring
a smile to Kordi's face.

04:47.390 --> 04:51.630
This cargo is of vital importance
to me and the Rebel Alliance.

04:51.660 --> 04:53.560
And Chewbacca.

04:53.590 --> 04:56.660
Negative. My programming
forbids aiding the Alliance.

04:56.700 --> 04:58.570
Me too.
Forget it.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.600
I gotta get outta here.
No way.

05:00.630 --> 05:03.460
I'm out.

05:08.480 --> 05:11.480
Hello. I'm an appropriately
tall adult person

05:11.510 --> 05:14.370
capable of retrieving
this precious cargo.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.390
I'm sorry,
Mr. Appropriately Tall.

05:18.420 --> 05:21.360
I'm only hiring
real adult persons.

05:21.390 --> 05:24.330
Looks to me like you're
not hiring anybody.

05:24.360 --> 05:28.630
I've got a ship and a crew, and we could
handle your grab-and-go job, no problem.

05:28.660 --> 05:29.720
Is that real enough for you?

05:29.760 --> 05:32.590
Is everyone on your crew
as tall as you?

05:32.630 --> 05:35.530
Taller.

05:35.570 --> 05:40.410
I know we just had lunch, but
you know what I could go for?

05:40.440 --> 05:42.580
Uh... second lunch?
Yeah!

05:44.510 --> 05:46.370
Tell me what I want to hear!

05:46.410 --> 05:48.510
Um, everyone thinks you're
cooler than Boba Fett.

05:48.550 --> 05:52.320
- Nobody laughs at
that diaper on your head.

05:52.350 --> 05:54.410
Just telling you what
you want to hear, Dengar.

05:54.450 --> 05:58.650
Twelve systems searched, and we still
haven't found the little twerp!

05:58.690 --> 06:00.650
What am I gonna tell Graballa?

06:00.690 --> 06:03.660
Tell him we found a great snack stand.
Good jawa juice.

06:03.700 --> 06:05.570
Yeah.
Good variety.

06:05.600 --> 06:10.510
Oh, and we heard about a job
with a big payoff.

06:10.540 --> 06:11.670
How big?

06:11.700 --> 06:14.630
Any moment now.

06:14.670 --> 06:16.640
Any moment.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.380
So exciting.

06:19.410 --> 06:22.410
- Come on! We've got a job.
- But they're just about to...

06:22.450 --> 06:25.350
Aw! The pods!
I missed them!

06:25.390 --> 06:28.460
No point in staying then.
Come on! A real job!

06:28.490 --> 06:31.330
You took Rowan
to the Lower Ring?

06:31.360 --> 06:33.760
Why not give him death sticks,
while you're at it?

06:33.790 --> 06:35.390
It was brother bonding time?

06:35.430 --> 06:38.330
And I landed us a job.
An easy in and out.

06:38.360 --> 06:40.360
Come on, Kordi.
We gotta do this!

06:40.400 --> 06:42.700
Oh, we're taking
this Lando guy's job.

06:42.740 --> 06:44.670
You had me
at "small fortune."

06:44.700 --> 06:47.730
But you ever take Rowan
to the Lower Ring again,

06:47.770 --> 06:49.730
I'll launch you into hyperspace

06:49.780 --> 06:51.680
with my boots!

06:51.710 --> 06:53.670
Come on, come on!

06:53.710 --> 06:56.610
Into the ship already!

06:56.650 --> 06:58.550
- Roger, you mind the shop.
- Waah!

06:58.590 --> 07:01.560
We don't want anyone getting
there before us, so tell no one.

07:01.590 --> 07:03.430
Roger, roger.

07:03.460 --> 07:05.530
This isn't a salvage mission,

07:05.560 --> 07:08.500
so no sense lugging the cargo
carrier all the way to Bespin.

07:08.530 --> 07:10.430
Right.
Keep it lean and mean.

07:10.460 --> 07:13.290
Separation in three, two, one.

07:18.370 --> 07:21.730
<i>Remember, Roger, tell no one where
we're going or what we're doing.</i>

07:21.770 --> 07:24.340
<i>- Are we clear on that?</i>
- Crystal clear.

07:24.380 --> 07:26.620
Your secret is safe with me.

07:26.650 --> 07:28.280
Secret?

07:28.310 --> 07:29.740
What secret?
There's no secret at all.

07:29.780 --> 07:32.640
Not on Cloud City.
Nuh-uh!

07:32.690 --> 07:35.590
We are <i>crystal</i> clear on that.

07:35.620 --> 07:37.550
Crystal? On Cloud City?

07:37.590 --> 07:40.530
I wasn't supposed
to say anything.

07:40.560 --> 07:43.530
I can't stop telling secrets.

07:45.630 --> 07:47.530
Much better.

07:47.570 --> 07:51.470
Has Rowan sensed a Kyber
Saber crystal on Cloud City?

07:51.500 --> 07:54.330
But why would he keep that
a secret from me?

07:54.370 --> 07:57.400
Unless...
Does he know the truth?

07:57.440 --> 08:00.710
Pretty smooth.
Aaah!

08:02.380 --> 08:04.710
Welcome aboard. This is
your captain, Zander.

08:04.750 --> 08:08.280
We're off to Cloud City where
today's forecast is cloudy...

08:08.320 --> 08:10.680
with a chance of fortune!

08:12.690 --> 08:17.520
If the Freemakers plan to double-cross
me, they will rue the day.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.640
Strap in, boys.
Next stop, Cloud City.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.070
Aw! You're trying too hard.

08:37.100 --> 08:40.940
How 'bout you give it a rest and
take us out of hyperspace instead?

08:40.970 --> 08:42.909
Really? I've never...

08:42.940 --> 08:45.310
You can do it. Just push
forward on that lever.

08:47.010 --> 08:48.880
Easy.

08:52.250 --> 08:54.190

09:25.880 --> 09:29.240
Oh, this is embarrassing. Zander,
did you forget to charge this?

09:29.290 --> 09:31.960
Blast. I did.
Sorry, Kordi.

09:31.990 --> 09:34.890
And I can't remember
what the order was for.

09:34.920 --> 09:37.290
Help us out, fellas. What
around here needs repairs?

09:37.330 --> 09:40.170
Nothing. Get back in your
ship and get outta here.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.130
Oh. Okay.

09:42.170 --> 09:45.100
We get paid all the same,
and I like free money.

09:45.130 --> 09:48.230
Good luck explaining to the Emperor
why he paid us for doing nothing.

09:48.270 --> 09:50.270
I understand
he's very forgiving.

the Emperor of nothing.

10:22.310 --> 10:24.340
We will inform
the Emperor of nothing.

10:24.370 --> 10:28.140
You will go for a long march
off a short platform.

14:01.260 --> 14:03.190
Precious cargo.

14:03.230 --> 14:07.130
Hey, Zander? You're not
going to believe this,

14:07.160 --> 14:10.060
but I think I've actually discovered
what's wrong with this chamber.

14:10.100 --> 14:13.140
- It's not mynocks?
- I know. Weird, right?

14:13.170 --> 14:16.940
Look. Somehow that coolant
tube got cut in two.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.970
Huh. I can reach it
from here.

14:22.010 --> 14:24.310
Hold on. I got this.

14:32.290 --> 14:35.890
Ugh! Why do I even try?

14:35.930 --> 14:37.360
I'm just not good enough.

14:45.200 --> 14:48.100
Hey. Look, Rowan!
You totally did it.

14:48.140 --> 14:50.040
I did?

14:50.070 --> 14:52.100
I used the For...
Aaah!

14:52.140 --> 14:54.000
Huh?

14:58.010 --> 14:59.910
Rowan, no!

14:59.950 --> 15:01.120
What have I done?

15:01.150 --> 15:03.050
Hey! Looks like
you fixed it.

15:04.090 --> 15:05.920
Good job!

15:09.790 --> 15:11.790
Great news! I got the goods.
sorry, buddy.

15:11.830 --> 15:13.770
No, I got the goods!

15:13.800 --> 15:16.170
No, I will take
the Kyber Saber crystal!

15:16.200 --> 15:19.200
- What?
- You know, for safekeeping.

15:19.240 --> 15:23.040
Kyber Saber crystal?
Is that what's in the case?

15:23.070 --> 15:26.200
- Isn't it? -Zander, why is
Rowan frozen in carbonite?

15:26.240 --> 15:30.000
What are <i>you</i> doing here, and
why are these guys with you?

15:30.050 --> 15:32.950
We're not with her. We're just
looking for precious cargo.

15:32.980 --> 15:35.110
And lunch. Is this
the food court?

15:35.150 --> 15:37.850
One Mygeeto burrito, please.

15:37.890 --> 15:40.860
Um, maybe it's 'cause I can't
hear so good in this helmet,

15:40.890 --> 15:42.030
but I'm very confused.

15:42.060 --> 15:44.800
Isn't that the kid
Graballa wants?

15:45.960 --> 15:47.820
It is!
Take them both!

15:49.870 --> 15:50.940
- Rowan!
- The crystal!

15:50.970 --> 15:53.240
- The case! -My burrito!
- I surrender!

15:56.240 --> 15:59.210
First you try to take
the crystals for yourself.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.070
Then you lose
the only link to them?

16:01.110 --> 16:03.080
Why would <i>we</i> try
to take the crystals?

16:03.110 --> 16:05.710
Um... That's
a good question.

16:05.750 --> 16:07.190
Argue later.
They got Rowan.

16:11.150 --> 16:13.980
How did they get back there?

16:17.030 --> 16:19.060
<i>Naare! What's new?</i>

16:19.100 --> 16:21.030
<i>Enjoying Cloud City, hmm?</i>

16:21.060 --> 16:22.920
<i>Good, good.</i>

16:22.970 --> 16:24.970
<i>Also, where are my crystals?</i>

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Uh, you're breaking up.
Losing signal.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.010
Gotta go now!

16:29.040 --> 16:31.840
Faster, you slugs!

16:31.870 --> 16:34.900
- Hand over the crystal!
- My pleasure!

16:36.910 --> 16:38.870
Get the kid to the ship!

16:38.910 --> 16:40.740
Come back with our brother!

16:45.860 --> 16:47.760
All these hallways
look the same.

16:47.790 --> 16:49.190
Some color coding would be nice.

16:52.130 --> 16:53.770
They're getting away!

16:53.800 --> 16:56.100
Uh! Not that way!

16:56.130 --> 16:58.160
Oh, right.
Sorry.

16:58.200 --> 17:02.040
They'll figure that out before we get
over there. Come on! I've got an idea!

17:02.070 --> 17:04.099
Do his ideas ever work?
Be honest.

17:04.140 --> 17:06.079
Um... 50/50?

17:08.980 --> 17:12.980
- Ah! I can't remember
which one it was!

17:13.020 --> 17:15.990
No time to do this gently.

17:19.990 --> 17:22.760
Are you mad?
What have you done?

17:22.790 --> 17:25.920
Shut down the repulsorlift generator.
Seemed like the smart play.

17:25.960 --> 17:29.760
- Though I might be wrong
about that!

17:31.770 --> 17:33.170
What's going on?

17:33.200 --> 17:36.730
Best guess... Somebody forgot
to pay their power bill.

17:45.110 --> 17:46.210
Here they come!

17:48.120 --> 17:52.060
We got Rowan! But we still don't
have that precious cargo.

18:07.100 --> 18:09.800
Aaah!
Move aside.

18:09.840 --> 18:11.810
I've got this!

18:20.780 --> 18:22.840
Oh, Freemakers,
what would you do with...

18:25.960 --> 18:27.860
Yes!

18:39.100 --> 18:42.200
You broke the repulsorlift generator.
Can you fix it?

18:42.240 --> 18:45.140
Not if I can't reach it.

18:45.170 --> 18:49.100
If Naare hadn't picked this moment to visit
dreamland, she could "use the Force."

18:49.150 --> 18:52.080
- Rowan could do it if he wasn't frozen.
- So, unfreeze him.

18:52.110 --> 18:54.110
You can do that?

19:00.960 --> 19:03.860
Where am I?

19:03.890 --> 19:06.850
I can't see anything. You've
got carbonite sickness.

19:06.900 --> 19:10.940
How did that happen? Yeah, funny story.
You'll laugh. But later.

19:10.970 --> 19:15.840
Right now we need you to use the Force to
reconnect those repulsorlift generator cables.

19:15.870 --> 19:18.870
Use the Force, when I can't see?

19:18.910 --> 19:21.850
Maybe the Force doesn't
need you to see, Rowan.

19:21.880 --> 19:24.180
Maybe it's not what you see.

19:24.210 --> 19:26.140
Maybe it's what you feel.

19:30.190 --> 19:33.160
I told you, I'm not good enough.

19:37.090 --> 19:40.120
Or we could just plummet to our doom.
Your call.

19:41.200 --> 19:44.040
When you put it that way...

19:49.100 --> 19:51.000
You can do this, Rowan.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.140
I know you can.

19:53.180 --> 19:56.010
We're right here with you.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.900
Whoa!

20:34.850 --> 20:36.920
- You did it!
- You saved the city!

20:36.950 --> 20:38.810
And I used the Force!

20:38.850 --> 20:42.150
You were right, Zander. I was
looking at it all wrong.

20:42.190 --> 20:46.250
It's almost as if my eyes
were, you know, deceiving me.

20:46.300 --> 20:49.800
And that's why you're my
hero, little brother.

20:49.830 --> 20:51.230
Hmm.

20:56.310 --> 20:59.110
Well done, Freemakers.

20:59.140 --> 21:02.100
You'll be handsomely
rewarded, of course.

21:02.140 --> 21:05.770
Yes! Handsome rewards
make me happy.

21:05.810 --> 21:08.040
Though I can also live
with ugly rewards.

21:08.080 --> 21:09.740
I don't judge rewards.

21:09.790 --> 21:12.120
And now to be reunited with...

21:13.190 --> 21:15.230
Is it a crystal?

21:16.230 --> 21:19.060
My precious cargo!

21:20.100 --> 21:21.200
A cape?

21:21.230 --> 21:24.140
Can't fight the Empire
without the right style.

21:24.170 --> 21:28.040
And now I don't have to
wear Han's old clothes!

21:28.070 --> 21:30.110
That makes you happy too,
huh, Chewie?

21:32.040 --> 21:34.000
Oh! You like that cape?

21:34.040 --> 21:37.100
I can get you one just like it.
I know a guy.

21:37.150 --> 21:41.190
Well, it wasn't a total loss. I
know who the mysterious boy is.

21:41.220 --> 21:44.020
Rowan Freemaker.

21:44.050 --> 21:47.110
And if I ever get out of here,
I might even tell Graballa.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.990
Cloud City prison food
ain't so bad.

21:50.030 --> 21:52.200
Mmm, five stars.
I'd eat here again.

21:53.260 --> 21:56.060
Huh?

21:57.305 --> 22:03.360
