01:50.986 --> 01:53.080
Leave it!

01:55.407 --> 01:58.001
Grab our stuff!

02:01.079 --> 02:02.797
Come on, hurry UP!

02:05.000 --> 02:06.798
Curse him!

02:08.878 --> 02:10.381
NO FISHING

02:14.426 --> 02:18.602
AN (ALMOST) PERFECT VILLAGE

02:20.599 --> 02:23.899
Good morning,
my name is Domenico Buonocore

02:24.144 --> 02:28.524
and this is my hometown,
Pietramezzana.

02:29.816 --> 02:34.037
Now you see it like this,
but it used to be different.

02:37.366 --> 02:42.793
We used to have a job,
it was hard but we managed.

03:02.724 --> 03:06.479
Then they closed the mine
and everything changed.

03:06.687 --> 03:12.694
Most of the townfolk have left
but those 120 who stayed

03:12.901 --> 03:17.748
can count on unemployment
checks. As long as it lasts...

03:17.989 --> 03:21.994
Good morning, Tonino. Are you
taking it all? No investments?

03:22.160 --> 03:24.208
The receipt.

03:25.789 --> 03:28.918
Take care, ATM!

03:29.126 --> 03:33.222
- Don't get upset, he's just rude.
- It's not for what he called me.

03:33.422 --> 03:36.221
- No...
- I'm not touchy.

03:36.425 --> 03:42.103
But there are so many good
investments available right now!

03:45.016 --> 03:48.646
Bye, ATM... I mean... Nicola.

03:51.440 --> 03:56.162
Hello, Nicola. This one is mine
and this is Mr. Pace's.

03:56.361 --> 03:59.615
- I've told you. Don't do this.
- Why not?

03:59.823 --> 04:02.747
- It's illegal.
- You have to do it.

04:02.993 --> 04:06.918
Do you want to see his
authorization? His ID?

04:07.122 --> 04:09.466
Don't scream.

04:11.918 --> 04:14.171
- Every given month...
- Here we are.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.132
- Bye.
- Good morning, Saverio.

04:24.139 --> 04:28.064
Hi, Domenico.
I talked to my brother.

04:28.727 --> 04:33.528
- There's a job opening in town.
- Rosaria, I'm not leaving.

04:33.732 --> 04:38.863
You spend your day talking about
when you had a job at the mine

04:39.070 --> 04:42.199
and meanwhile
the roof is about to leak.

04:42.407 --> 04:45.286
But it doesn't matter,
because we get two checks!

04:45.494 --> 04:47.292
Not that again!

04:47.496 --> 04:51.296
Pace himself asked me
to cash his check for him.

04:51.500 --> 04:55.676
- He signed the authorization.
- He has been dead for a while.

04:55.879 --> 04:59.008
But the government
thinks he is still alive!

05:05.597 --> 05:07.725
I don't want to move to town.

05:07.933 --> 05:11.779
Let me live the life that I want.

05:12.395 --> 05:16.696
Domenico, that job is for me.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.999
Good luck, then.

05:45.637 --> 05:49.517
When it's Nicola ringing those bells
no one ever shows up.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.153
They must all be stuck in traffic!

05:53.353 --> 05:57.699
This was supposed to be
a village meeting.

05:57.899 --> 06:01.028
This seems more
of a condominium's meeting!

06:01.236 --> 06:05.412
What are those factory people
going to do with my land?

06:05.615 --> 06:09.791
They want to build a plant here
because they'd get tax exemption.

06:09.995 --> 06:13.920
But we aren't a tax haven!

06:14.124 --> 06:18.300
- This is not the problem.
- Why give them an exemption?

06:18.503 --> 06:21.632
You could have offered something
less than Cyprus did.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.184
I tried to fool them

06:24.384 --> 06:27.854
so that they wouldn't see
how fake our candidacy is.

06:28.054 --> 06:31.900
- Tax exemption for how long?
- Forever.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.479
- That's not the problem.
- What then?

06:35.687 --> 06:39.737
It needs to be more
than 200 inhabitants

06:39.983 --> 06:41.463
and we are less
than half that number.

06:41.526 --> 06:46.703
That's easily solved.
With all the people who left,

06:46.907 --> 06:51.003
we just have to cheat a little.
They won't come here to count us.

06:51.202 --> 06:54.877
- Who takes care of the numbers?
- The tax collectors.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.927
The insurance requires
a doctor to live here.

06:59.127 --> 07:03.348
It has been nine years that
we have been looking for a doctor.

07:03.548 --> 07:07.428
Let's find one,
so we can stop looking.

07:07.636 --> 07:12.142
Mr. Mayor, we can find a doctor
who will live here, right?

07:15.393 --> 07:19.193
Consolino, let's talk about that.

07:33.912 --> 07:37.041
Excuse me. Keep the change.
Good evening.

07:42.671 --> 07:45.174
Here she is, our beauty!

07:45.382 --> 07:49.137
Anna, bring us more wine. It's on me!

07:49.344 --> 07:53.941
- I'll divorce and marry you.
- You're too old for me, Michele.

07:56.518 --> 07:59.692
Bring more wine!

08:08.530 --> 08:09.907
How..-

08:17.080 --> 08:20.550
What are you doing, Teresa?

08:24.004 --> 08:25.426
Domenico...

08:32.470 --> 08:36.566
- Mr. Mayor, where are you going?
- On holiday.

08:36.765 --> 08:40.645
And you are taking
the furniture with you?

08:40.854 --> 08:44.529
I got a well paid job in the city.

08:44.733 --> 08:49.830
My daughter needs braces
for her teeth. She's a mess.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.078
Show him your teeth.

08:55.243 --> 09:00.374
- She got it from her mother.
- Thank you very much!

09:00.582 --> 09:04.587
- I was trying to say...
- That I'm ugly, right?

09:04.794 --> 09:08.515
- Franca!
- What if she got your nose?

09:08.715 --> 09:12.436
See? I no longer
have an authority here.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.264
What about the factory?

09:26.107 --> 09:29.452
- Do you need help?
- No, thank you.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.417
Good luck.

09:56.930 --> 10:00.685
What do I tell my brother?

10:05.438 --> 10:08.362
Tell him that
we are opening a factory!

10:16.616 --> 10:22.214
Celestino, send this
to every doctor in Italy.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.086
- To each one of them.
- All right.

10:35.343 --> 10:38.062
How long will it take?

10:39.722 --> 10:43.226
- Do you need anything else?
- No.

10:43.434 --> 10:47.234
See? What I was telling you
about Celestino?

11:04.873 --> 11:07.001
You've got an e-mail.

11:09.544 --> 11:14.596
"Dear Doctor, in the magnificent
setting of Pietramezzana,

11:14.799 --> 11:19.020
we are offering you a permanent
job as the local doctor."

11:19.220 --> 11:23.475
Pietramezzana is as beautiful as
Cortina, St. Moritz or Courmayeur.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.857
They even add a drawing.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.814
It's one of those places
with good air,

11:30.023 --> 11:34.995
where they work the land,
they milk the cows...

11:35.153 --> 11:38.532
- While we are making fake boobs.
- You're right.

11:38.740 --> 11:42.085
- I'll answer that you accept it.
- Let me see.

11:42.285 --> 11:44.003
That's the picture.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.504
Pietramezzana? Maybe in another life!

11:47.707 --> 11:51.052
Why did you delete it?
I want to live among cows!

11:55.673 --> 11:59.598
Good morning, Caterina.
Is Celestino home?

11:59.802 --> 12:03.022
No one replied to the e-mail yet.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.645
Goodbye.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.317
Hi, Domenico.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.863
So? The doctor?

12:21.491 --> 12:23.289
Any news?

12:26.079 --> 12:27.752
I'm sorry.

12:38.508 --> 12:42.888
Michele, if I move to the city,
will you come visit me?

12:44.347 --> 12:48.818
- No.
- What? Not even once?

12:50.395 --> 12:54.866
- Shut up!
- I'm not joking.

12:55.066 --> 12:58.866
Rosaria has been offered
a good job in the city.

13:02.532 --> 13:05.786
- Forget about it.
- You can come by bus.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.463
- I don't know where to get it.
- And the train?

13:08.663 --> 13:10.711
Never seen one.

13:11.499 --> 13:16.221
Michele,
have you ever been to the city?

13:18.298 --> 13:22.098
- No.
- Never ever?

13:24.345 --> 13:26.473
Never.

13:26.681 --> 13:30.311
- What's wrong about it?
- Nothing.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.866
- License and registration.
- Good evening.

13:45.074 --> 13:49.329
I'm a doctor. I was speeding
because I got an emergency call.

13:49.537 --> 13:54.008
- Where are you coming from?
- From a cricket match.

13:54.208 --> 13:57.678
- Your ID.
- Did you get it? He's a doctor.

13:57.879 --> 14:00.849
We're late because of you.

14:01.049 --> 14:04.724
You should be troubling criminals
instead of doctors.

14:04.927 --> 14:08.056
- Honey, please...
- Now, it's my fault?

14:08.264 --> 14:10.813
You are abusing your authority!

14:11.059 --> 14:14.654
- Say something.
- And your ID too, Miss.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.983
Sure. Right away.

14:18.149 --> 14:19.992
Give it to him.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.287
It's a serious matter.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.865
Let us go, please.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.166
Calm down.

14:28.576 --> 14:32.046
What is this? Is this yours?

14:33.039 --> 14:36.543
What is this? What is this?

14:42.673 --> 14:46.644
Listen, I'm a plastic surgeon...

14:47.637 --> 14:51.608
I could
do something for your wife...

14:51.808 --> 14:56.735
I could make her boobs as hard
as rock... If that's not the issue,

14:56.896 --> 15:00.901
I could give her a Brazilian ass!

15:01.109 --> 15:05.660
Or I could help you
with that nose of yours!

15:07.407 --> 15:09.501
So you are a doctor...

15:09.700 --> 15:13.250
Yes, a plastic surgeon.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.126
Get down, it's no use.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.870
First of all,
I want to say something.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.243
When you hear the bells,

15:48.448 --> 15:51.497
it means
that there's a general meeting.

15:51.701 --> 15:55.456
And when there's a general meeting,
you must come to it.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.467
A doctor will come to live
in Pietramezzana.

16:02.462 --> 16:07.389
For a month. Wait, don't go away!
I'm not clone yet.

16:07.592 --> 16:10.812
I know it's not much,
but we have one month

16:11.012 --> 16:14.016
to convince the doctor

16:14.182 --> 16:17.106
to sign a long term contract.

16:17.310 --> 16:21.861
If he will sign,
we will have a real job

16:22.064 --> 16:26.069
for us and for our children.

16:26.277 --> 16:29.702
So we will keep living here
in our ancestor's homes.

16:29.906 --> 16:34.377
Who wants to tell the Government
where to put that charity

16:34.577 --> 16:37.126
that has been ruining our lives?

16:37.330 --> 16:40.675
Who wants to stop feeling useless?

16:40.875 --> 16:44.425
Who wants to wake up
in the morning and go to work

16:44.629 --> 16:48.509
instead of wandering around
because there's nothing to do?

16:49.634 --> 16:53.389
Who wants to keep living here?

16:57.016 --> 16:59.815
Come on!

17:00.019 --> 17:02.989
- Let's go!
- Come on!

17:04.773 --> 17:08.744
We have to get this doctor...
Gianluca Terragni

17:08.986 --> 17:12.707
to fall in love
with Pietramezzana.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.618
Well done!

17:22.541 --> 17:25.295
Number one.

17:25.502 --> 17:29.098
When the doctor comes here

17:30.258 --> 17:33.432
we must blind him.
- Let's turn on the streetlamps.

17:33.636 --> 17:37.732
- What are you talking about?
- Let's make everything shiny.

17:37.932 --> 17:42.062
Clean up the village.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.188
Number two...

17:47.400 --> 17:50.370
- That is?
- Number two...

17:51.320 --> 17:54.164
If he could often find money
on the ground,

17:54.365 --> 17:56.993
he would think that
this village is wealthy.

17:57.159 --> 18:00.754
- How much money?
- Just a few cents.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.591
It puts people in a good mood.

18:03.791 --> 18:06.544
- Will you see to it?
- I'll do it.

18:06.752 --> 18:10.757
- Money.
- Number three.

18:11.757 --> 18:15.853
- Where will he sleep?
- We could use a hotel.

18:16.053 --> 18:20.479
- The closest one is 40 km away.
- He'll stay at my place.

18:20.683 --> 18:24.688
- With that furniture?
- What's wrong with it?

18:24.895 --> 18:27.990
- It's so old school.
- Do you know what he likes?

18:28.190 --> 18:30.784
- Do you?
- No.

18:30.985 --> 18:33.238
Who knows what he likes?

18:38.284 --> 18:41.037
So this is Gianluca Terragni.

18:42.079 --> 18:44.252
That's his Facebook.

18:44.457 --> 18:48.132
What does a book
have to do with this?

18:49.086 --> 18:52.215
Facebook is a social network.

18:53.049 --> 18:55.268
He accepted my friendship.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.562
- So candidly?
- Yes.

18:57.762 --> 19:01.232
- Whatever!
- Are there any other pictures?

19:01.432 --> 19:06.063
- What's this?
- He's a plastic surgeon...

19:06.270 --> 19:08.443
<i>'</i> who?
<i>'</i> Him?

19:08.648 --> 19:10.616
He's a plastic surgeon.

19:11.609 --> 19:13.452
What's this?

19:13.653 --> 19:17.283
That's cricket.
He is a cricket fan.

19:17.490 --> 19:21.040
- He'll find lots of bugs here.
- Cricket is also a sport.

19:21.243 --> 19:24.873
- Not only an insect.
- How was I supposed to know?

19:25.081 --> 19:27.800
- Domenico, are you writing?
- Yes, I am.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.424
This is a cricket field.

19:30.628 --> 19:33.882
I thought it was a record
with something written on top.

19:35.216 --> 19:37.310
This is the bat.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.684
It's like a short oar.

19:40.888 --> 19:44.017
- And this is the uniform.
- White.

19:44.225 --> 19:48.071
- And a helmet.
- We have plenty of those.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.989
And these are the rules.
Should I print them?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.988
Yes, please.

20:30.104 --> 20:34.610
- Here I am.
- How do we make this?

20:34.817 --> 20:39.664
Give me that ball.
You must play cricket!

20:53.502 --> 20:55.049
What's this?

20:55.254 --> 20:57.723
The mine's old switchboard.

20:57.923 --> 21:01.052
Did Guglielmo Marconi built it?

21:01.260 --> 21:06.266
- It just needs a good cleaning.
- That's heavy! Help me.

21:07.683 --> 21:13.110
Let's place a mic in his house
phone so we can spy on him.

21:13.314 --> 21:15.442
- Who?
- The doctor.

21:15.649 --> 21:18.744
- We might get arrested.
- Don't be so negative!

21:18.986 --> 21:22.115
You're making a scene.

21:22.323 --> 21:26.874
We just have to move to
our country estate for a month.

21:27.077 --> 21:31.332
You've gone mad.
Putting a stranger in our house.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.043
He is the doctor of the village.

21:34.251 --> 21:37.004
I don't need a doctor.
I'm healthy.

21:37.213 --> 21:41.093
For now...
But you may need him, one day.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.893
Why not you?

21:43.093 --> 21:48.475
This is a little sacrifice
for the good of our village.

21:48.682 --> 21:51.105
- Why do I care?
- Calm down.

21:51.310 --> 21:54.814
You know what?
I'll go stay with our daughter.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.821
- Do you remember her?
- Of course I do.

21:58.108 --> 22:01.328
- You'll leave me like a dog.
- With your dog.

22:01.529 --> 22:04.408
You, your dog
and the dog biscuits!

22:05.366 --> 22:09.121
- Want one?
- You find it funny?

22:10.496 --> 22:16.128
Cover the furniture or,
when I get back, I'll beat you up.

22:29.557 --> 22:34.358
We'll think about the uniforms later.
There's room for improvement...

22:35.396 --> 22:39.526
- Did you read the instructions?
- Yes.

22:39.733 --> 22:43.454
Let's start. Go on the field.

22:43.654 --> 22:47.830
Calm down. Use your mind.

22:48.033 --> 22:52.288
The short people in front
and the tall people in the back.

22:52.496 --> 22:55.500
Come on. Spread out.

22:55.708 --> 22:58.803
Let's stay focused.

22:59.003 --> 23:02.507
We can do this.
Here are the instructions.

23:02.715 --> 23:06.265
- But it's in English.
- We can see the pictures.

23:06.468 --> 23:10.518
Let's just spread out on the field
like it's shown here.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.442
Then we'll try
to figure out the game.

23:13.642 --> 23:17.237
If we put all of ourselves
into this project,

23:17.396 --> 23:23.779
if we try to look
at the player who is next to us

23:23.986 --> 23:29.083
and we get strength from his eyes

23:29.283 --> 23:34.835
we will do this,
because we are a good team!

23:35.039 --> 23:38.760
Yes! Scream with me!

23:51.263 --> 23:55.063
That's enough. We got this right.

23:55.267 --> 23:58.487
- Now we can...
- No!

23:59.772 --> 24:01.991
Domenico...

24:37.559 --> 24:41.314
I'm going. Bye.

24:44.608 --> 24:47.031
- What's wrong?
- It's too tight.

24:47.236 --> 24:50.740
Last time I wore, it was at your
brother's wedding, 20 years ago.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.789
Fabric shrinks over time.

24:54.576 --> 24:57.170
The jacket?

24:57.371 --> 25:00.250
- I can't button it.
- Wait.

25:03.419 --> 25:08.846
What are you doing?
I don't like the smell of mothballs.

25:11.844 --> 25:14.814
How handsome!
You look like Berlusconi!

25:20.394 --> 25:24.991
I can't create a million jobs,
but maybe 50...

26:06.482 --> 26:11.409
I'm Domenico Buonocore,
the mayor of this village. Welcome.

26:11.612 --> 26:13.706
- Thank you.
- Do you need help?

26:14.740 --> 26:18.165
- I'll take this.
- As you prefer.

26:18.368 --> 26:21.292
- Come.
- Is it dangerous to cross?

26:32.007 --> 26:35.136
We'll be there soon.

26:41.433 --> 26:45.779
These are our Dolomites.
Millennia old!

27:12.756 --> 27:17.478
I've been living here for 60 years
and I have never seen this.

27:18.262 --> 27:22.312
- Did it rain a lot?
- No. It's the mountain goats.

27:22.516 --> 27:27.522
They are cute but
they keep mating and then...

27:27.729 --> 27:32.610
Let's call for help...
My phone... There's no signal.

27:32.818 --> 27:34.786
It comes and goes.

27:36.280 --> 27:40.535
- What then?
- We'll use the direct route.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.933
They will use the cableway!

27:56.175 --> 27:58.223
<i>Now mow'-!</i>

27:58.427 --> 28:00.600
They had to see us from afar.

28:00.804 --> 28:04.104
- I know.
- They'll see we can't play.

28:04.308 --> 28:06.902
- Wait.
- We suck.

28:07.895 --> 28:10.364
- What about my luggage?
- We'll send those later.

28:10.564 --> 28:12.658
- And my bike too?
- Yes.

28:14.818 --> 28:16.070
Shall I climb in?

28:23.493 --> 28:26.747
Let's keep calm and spread out.

28:26.997 --> 28:29.125
Hold on tight.

28:30.459 --> 28:33.588
- Is it dangerous?
- Just a little.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.033
Doctor!

30:02.509 --> 30:06.685
- Where am I?
- Welcome to Pietramezzana.

30:07.889 --> 30:09.812
- The mayor?
- Here I am.

30:10.017 --> 30:11.894
Put me down.

30:12.185 --> 30:15.155
- What happened?
- You fainted.

30:15.355 --> 30:17.904
- Let me go.
- Let him go.

30:18.108 --> 30:20.827
- My luggage?
- Here they are.

30:21.570 --> 30:24.039
- What's wrong?
- My jacket.

30:24.239 --> 30:26.833
- It's here.
- And my bike?

30:27.034 --> 30:31.460
- We'll get it later.
- No, let's go now.

30:31.663 --> 30:35.668
Let me go!
I've already had two stolen.

30:35.876 --> 30:39.926
Come here, doctor.
No one will touch it here.

30:40.130 --> 30:44.010
- That bike is expensive.
- Come here.

30:44.217 --> 30:49.519
- Let's go.
- Are they playing cricket?

30:49.723 --> 30:54.354
- It's an old tradition here.
- It's my favorite sport!

30:54.561 --> 30:58.907
It's very popular in India,
but I never expected it here.

30:59.107 --> 31:03.704
We had Indians here...
During the war.

31:03.904 --> 31:08.000
- There were some troops...
- I didn't know that.

31:08.200 --> 31:11.670
I've never seen a team
play in such heavy defense.

31:11.870 --> 31:16.842
- They want to cover...
- Too much defense?

31:17.501 --> 31:23.008
- I keep telling them that...
- It's a daring tactic.

31:26.718 --> 31:31.645
Let's go see... Just one inning.

31:31.848 --> 31:35.819
They are coming here.
He will be here in two minutes.

31:37.062 --> 31:42.489
- It's better than football.
- We hate football here.

31:42.692 --> 31:45.491
We'll be miserable...

32:13.849 --> 32:16.102
What's up?

32:20.397 --> 32:22.491
Nice.

32:25.110 --> 32:29.206
- Did both teams win?
- No, but they are good losers.

32:29.406 --> 32:33.912
- When is the next match?
- The season is finished.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.087
How unfortunate!

32:39.332 --> 32:42.927
Let's go, before
someone takes your bike.

32:43.170 --> 32:48.518
- You said no one would touch it.
- Let's not take our chances.

32:48.717 --> 32:50.344
Here we are.

32:50.552 --> 32:55.149
A long time ago, this was
Doctor Paterno's bedroom.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.646
The old doctor of this village.

32:57.851 --> 33:00.821
He was always available.
Day and night.

33:01.021 --> 33:04.742
He had this little door made.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.862
At night, if someone needed him,

33:08.069 --> 33:12.620
they knocked at this door
and he would open right away.

33:13.992 --> 33:17.542
He would grab his bag
and his jacket and go.

33:17.746 --> 33:20.215
No matter the weather,

33:20.415 --> 33:23.009
even when it snowed or hailed.

33:24.544 --> 33:28.515
Don't be afraid to ask
if you need anything.

33:29.591 --> 33:31.559
Goodbye.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.854
Goodbye, doctor.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.879
- Come.
- Does it work?

34:00.080 --> 34:02.048
We don't know.

34:02.249 --> 34:04.468
I hear something.

34:04.668 --> 34:06.921
- I can't ear a thing.
- Turn it up.

34:08.505 --> 34:10.849
- What?
- It's fragile.

34:11.049 --> 34:15.395
- Hello?
- Honey, how are you?

34:16.012 --> 34:18.936
I tried to call you
but there's no signal here.

34:19.139 --> 34:22.235
I'm sorry, Gianluca. Really.

34:22.435 --> 34:25.279
It doesn't matter.

34:25.480 --> 34:29.030
What about Mrs. Cerami's surgery?
It was important.

34:29.234 --> 34:32.204
I've postponed it to September.

34:32.404 --> 34:36.329
She wanted to show off
her new boobs this summer

34:36.533 --> 34:40.879
but I've convinced her
with a nice discount.

34:41.079 --> 34:45.458
- Do you like that village?
- Well...

34:45.667 --> 34:48.090
It's the asshole of the world!

34:48.295 --> 34:51.094
How rude!

34:51.297 --> 34:53.016
- What words!
- It's just an expression.

34:53.216 --> 34:55.810
- It's not so bad.
- What about the people?

34:56.011 --> 34:59.106
The guy who came to pick me up
seems pretty nice.

35:00.807 --> 35:05.654
But he need
some surgeries on his face.

35:05.854 --> 35:08.277
- What?
- Plastic surgery.

35:08.481 --> 35:10.734
- Why?
- Were you rude to him?

35:10.984 --> 35:15.114
- No...
- They all play cricket here.

35:20.076 --> 35:23.671
- He believes it!
- Are you happy, honey?

35:23.872 --> 35:25.374
Well...

35:25.582 --> 35:30.713
- I'm sorry, Fuffy...
- What a nice nickname!

35:30.920 --> 35:35.391
- I like it.
- What about the house?

35:37.135 --> 35:40.605
- Ask me another question.
- He was too impressed to talk.

35:40.805 --> 35:45.402
- He asked for another question.
- Describe it to me.

35:45.602 --> 35:49.527
- Ray Charles furnished it!
- Who?

35:49.731 --> 35:53.201
- Who is he?
- An architect.

35:53.401 --> 35:57.156
- So it's badly furnished?
- It's furnished with a taste...

35:57.364 --> 36:00.994
- You see?
- A horrible taste!

36:01.159 --> 36:05.915
- He said that it's ugly.
- It's really dreary.

36:06.122 --> 36:08.045
- Don't write it.
- I must do it.

36:08.249 --> 36:11.719
There's a picture of the man who
lives here. You should see him.

36:14.631 --> 36:18.602
- I can't stand him!
- I can't hear a thing now!

36:18.802 --> 36:20.520
- Honey?
- Hello?

36:20.720 --> 36:22.313
Here it is.

36:22.639 --> 36:26.735
The signal comes and goes.
It's a disaster here.

36:26.935 --> 36:32.988
- Poor Fuffy...
- I miss the city and our house.

36:33.191 --> 36:37.537
- And I miss you, Nicole.
- It's hard for me too.

36:37.737 --> 36:41.662
- Go eat something.
- Do you know what I fancy?

36:41.866 --> 36:43.743
Let's hear it.

36:43.993 --> 36:47.338
- Some sushi and sashimi.
- I don't see that happening.

36:50.291 --> 36:54.012
What does it mean?

37:17.068 --> 37:18.320
I'm going.

37:18.528 --> 37:21.452
Do a favor for your aunt:
what is...?

37:22.699 --> 37:24.542
How do you cook that?

37:24.743 --> 37:28.919
Sushi are rolls of rice
and sashimi is raw fish.

37:29.122 --> 37:30.795
Got it.

37:32.584 --> 37:35.713
- Your plan is disgusting.
- Good girl.

37:40.467 --> 37:46.895
Gabriele, get some boiled rice
and the fish sticks.

37:52.228 --> 37:53.980
Excuse me...

38:02.447 --> 38:05.747
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

38:05.992 --> 38:09.246
Can you recommend a restaurant?

38:09.454 --> 38:13.630
We've only got one.
Just follow the road.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.301
Thank you.

38:15.502 --> 38:19.052
It's hard to get lost
in such a tiny place!

38:21.382 --> 38:25.432
With all those ups and downs
it reminds me of San Francisco!

38:29.015 --> 38:31.484
Nice roses...

38:34.979 --> 38:39.029
- Thank you and good evening.
- Good evening.

39:21.442 --> 39:24.412
What's good to eat?
Not sushi, I guess.

39:26.990 --> 39:29.539
DISH OF THE DAY

39:30.368 --> 39:32.871
I'll take sushi, then.

39:34.414 --> 39:36.883
A lot of wasabi, please.

39:42.463 --> 39:44.761
I didn't see...

39:45.008 --> 39:48.512
- Is that tempura?
- Indeed...

40:33.806 --> 40:38.186
You have 14 siblings and they
all have high blood pressure?

40:38.394 --> 40:40.567
- Yes.
- What a mess it must be!

40:47.028 --> 40:48.530
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

40:48.738 --> 40:51.207
Lift your leg.

40:52.617 --> 40:57.168
- It hurts.
- You're fine. That way.

40:58.164 --> 41:02.214
- Touch it.
- No!

41:02.418 --> 41:06.889
- Is that mayo?
- No, it's for the itch.

41:07.090 --> 41:10.060
- Thank you, queer.
- You're welcome.

41:10.259 --> 41:12.102
Stick your tongue out.

41:20.228 --> 41:23.778
This is Gianluca and Nicole's
answering machine.

41:23.982 --> 41:27.156
Leave a message at the tone.

41:27.443 --> 41:29.537
Honey, it's me.

41:29.737 --> 41:34.664
I just called to see how you were.
I wanted to say hello.

41:34.867 --> 41:37.791
I had a busy day

41:37.996 --> 41:40.840
I had lots of patients.

41:42.375 --> 41:48.758
Call me, or I can try again later.
I love you. Bye.

41:49.007 --> 41:52.352
- You're bothering me!
- I'm worried!

42:00.476 --> 42:04.447
- Anyone here?
- You found it then!

42:04.647 --> 42:08.447
Hi, I didn't see you.

42:08.651 --> 42:13.282
- Are you reading?
- No, I'm looking at the pictures.

42:13.489 --> 42:15.036
Are you offended

42:15.241 --> 42:19.417
because
I said that this village is tiny?

42:19.620 --> 42:24.342
- Don't go. Ok, it's enormous!
- I've finished my shift.

42:24.542 --> 42:28.342
Do you work here? Last night
there was a fat woman...

42:28.546 --> 42:31.220
- My aunt.
- Very good looking.

42:32.467 --> 42:35.846
I wanted to tell you
that this is a wonderful place.

42:38.931 --> 42:42.561
A little rough at first, but...

42:44.270 --> 42:46.147
Yes, bye.

42:47.398 --> 42:51.995
Doctor...
How was your first day here?

42:52.195 --> 42:55.745
I never stopped for a minute.

42:55.907 --> 43:00.378
If it's going to be like this,
I'll have a stroke.

43:00.578 --> 43:03.206
Let me buy you a drink.

43:04.248 --> 43:06.296
I'm so tired.

43:10.463 --> 43:14.764
Half the village in just one day.
Are you crazy?

43:15.009 --> 43:17.387
Is this
how you want to persuade him?

43:17.595 --> 43:21.441
He said he's seen things
he has never seen before!

43:21.641 --> 43:26.738
He thought
he was back in the Middle Ages.

43:26.896 --> 43:31.993
Who told him he had
a wild boar birthmark?

43:32.151 --> 43:34.995
Well done, Tonino.

43:35.154 --> 43:39.580
Did you think you would persuade
the doctor to stay for five years

43:39.784 --> 43:44.085
by showing him a very rare
and itchy wild boar birthmark?

43:44.288 --> 43:48.714
It's itchy. It's a serious matter.
Do you understand me, queer?

43:49.752 --> 43:53.723
From now on
I'll book the appointments.

43:55.133 --> 43:57.727
Who wants to go tomorrow?

43:58.845 --> 44:04.693
We are taking no appointments
for tomorrow. You can go.

44:04.892 --> 44:08.647
Go away. Celestine, come here.

44:09.647 --> 44:12.992
I'm asking you because you are
not as ignorant as the others.

44:13.192 --> 44:15.615
- Do you like music?
- Yes.

44:15.820 --> 44:19.996
- Do you like Nu Jazz?
- Not really.

44:21.242 --> 44:24.496
- You'll get used to it.
- Not really...

44:38.551 --> 44:41.896
Do you like this rhythm?

44:42.930 --> 44:46.184
- Yes.
- Do you hear the backing vocals?

44:51.981 --> 44:54.109
It gives you goose bumps!

44:54.317 --> 44:59.039
Mr. Casini? I'm Mr. Buonocore
from Pietramezzana.

44:59.238 --> 45:02.412
- Who?
- The new mayor.

45:04.368 --> 45:08.669
- We have a doctor.
- I'm happy for you.

45:08.873 --> 45:12.002
I'm talking about the factory.
Do you remember?

45:12.210 --> 45:15.134
Sure.

45:15.338 --> 45:21.471
Your project
doesn't fit our requirements.

45:21.677 --> 45:24.396
It seems like
you are 120 inhabitants

45:24.597 --> 45:27.601
and we need twice that number.
- No.

45:27.808 --> 45:31.403
- We are 250.
- I believe you.

45:31.604 --> 45:35.825
But we will come there
and check it out, anyway.

45:36.025 --> 45:41.373
- We'll be waiting for you.
- I'll be honest with you.

45:41.572 --> 45:44.451
Cyprus has made us a better offer.

45:46.327 --> 45:49.080
- Do you understand?
- No.

45:49.288 --> 45:51.416
50.000.

45:51.624 --> 45:55.800
- 50.000 inhabitants?
- No, euros.

45:57.880 --> 46:00.884
50.000? From Cyprus?

46:01.092 --> 46:02.844
Yes.

46:04.178 --> 46:06.476
All right. Then so will we.

46:06.681 --> 46:10.436
Well, in that case, I'll come
to inspect the village next week.

46:10.643 --> 46:13.863
And we will be waiting for you.

46:14.063 --> 46:17.112
- Goodbye.
- See you soon.

46:19.527 --> 46:24.033
If we want to beat Cyprus
they want 50.000 euros.

46:24.240 --> 46:28.370
- 50.000?
- What is all this money for?

46:28.577 --> 46:33.003
- For the paperwork...
- It's not that much.

46:33.165 --> 46:38.171
- Soon we will make money again.
- It's not a bribe, is it?

46:38.379 --> 46:40.928
What are you thinking about?

46:41.173 --> 46:45.349
For such a large sum,
I'll have to ask my boss' consent.

46:45.553 --> 46:50.059
- Make your own decision.
- I can't.

46:50.266 --> 46:55.113
- They might close and put an ATM.
- You're already an ATM!

46:55.313 --> 47:01.116
I have been in charge of this bank
for 20 years, so I'll decide.

47:01.319 --> 47:05.620
- Next time dress a little better.
- Who is going to see us?

47:05.823 --> 47:09.703
Please take a seat, gentlemen.

47:12.121 --> 47:15.842
How can I help you?

47:17.543 --> 47:21.468
- Nicola, please...
- The pleasure is mine.

47:22.089 --> 47:25.810
You say you need a loan.

47:29.055 --> 47:33.561
- Can I kill him?
- Michele...

47:33.768 --> 47:37.398
- How much do you need?
- 50.000 euros.

47:37.605 --> 47:42.076
That is a large sum of money.
Fill out this form.

47:42.276 --> 47:44.199
You are Mister...?

47:44.403 --> 47:46.701
Domenico Buonocore.

47:48.157 --> 47:52.333
Domenico
with a "D" as in "Domodossola"?

47:54.789 --> 47:59.636
- He didn't like the meat.
- Was it bad?

47:59.835 --> 48:04.716
He had indigestion and a little gas.

48:04.924 --> 48:06.392
Gas?

48:07.843 --> 48:09.641
It happens.

48:14.100 --> 48:17.821
- His feet were cold...
- What's that?

48:19.397 --> 48:24.073
Let's just ask him to work here
without all this trickery.

48:24.276 --> 48:29.658
- Give me that paper.
- No, it's private information.

48:29.865 --> 48:33.745
I won't use it, let me see it.

48:36.997 --> 48:39.921
Give me that...

48:40.126 --> 48:42.629
He didn't have a father.

48:48.134 --> 48:50.683
Domenico...

48:50.886 --> 48:54.766
Don't smile like that!
You promised.

49:00.688 --> 49:04.443
- Doctor... Gianluca...
- Yes?

49:05.693 --> 49:09.243
- Let's be less formal.
- Sure.

49:10.239 --> 49:14.369
- How old are you?
- 36. Why?

49:17.830 --> 49:21.004
The same age
my son would have been.

49:21.834 --> 49:23.928
Your son?

49:26.005 --> 49:28.258
His name was Bernardo.

49:34.305 --> 49:38.811
It feels strange
talking to a young man his age...

49:39.894 --> 49:42.022
about women, about life.

49:59.038 --> 50:04.044
I found this in the mine.
I gave it to him.

50:06.253 --> 50:08.255
It's quartz.

50:09.715 --> 50:11.467
Here.

50:12.885 --> 50:16.935
- I can't. It's too much.
- I'd like you to have it.

50:20.100 --> 50:21.943
<i>Make me “EDDY-</i>

50:29.568 --> 50:32.447
- Will you take me one day?
- Where?

50:32.655 --> 50:35.534
- To the mine.
- Sure.

50:58.681 --> 51:01.400
- There's someone waving at you.
- Where?

51:01.600 --> 51:03.352
Over there.

51:08.857 --> 51:11.781
- Let's go.
- What about the fish?

51:11.986 --> 51:15.661
- Tomorrow.
- I'll drive.

51:42.725 --> 51:47.071
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Doctor Paternb.

51:47.271 --> 51:53.153
- I'm not Doctor Paterno.
- Come, my brother is sick.

51:53.360 --> 51:55.328
He doesn't talk anymore.

51:55.529 --> 51:58.453
Wait a second while I get dressed.

52:03.412 --> 52:07.508
Your blood pressure is low,
that's all.

52:07.708 --> 52:11.008
I go. Call me if you need me.

52:11.170 --> 52:13.298
Stay a bit longer.

52:13.505 --> 52:16.600
- Stay a bit longer.
- You want me to stay?

52:16.800 --> 52:20.020
Try to rest, to sleep a little bit.

52:51.210 --> 52:55.181
- Hi. Do you need help?
- No, it's too heavy.

52:55.381 --> 52:59.306
- Come on. I can do it.
- Are you sure?

53:03.472 --> 53:05.691
- Which way?
- Up.

53:05.891 --> 53:09.691
- Up the hill?
- Yes, right on top.

53:10.896 --> 53:13.445
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

53:25.786 --> 53:28.915
- Drink this.
- Thank you.

53:37.131 --> 53:39.759
When we talk on the phone

53:40.008 --> 53:43.228
I feel like I could touch you.

53:44.513 --> 53:47.813
If I was there,
what would you do to me?

53:49.518 --> 53:52.237
If you were here...

53:52.396 --> 53:55.366
I would touch your shoulders...

53:55.566 --> 53:58.866
- Yes...
- Slowly...

54:00.154 --> 54:04.625
Then I'd slide down slowly...

54:04.992 --> 54:07.461
Slowly...

54:07.995 --> 54:11.590
Until I'd touch your ass!

54:12.708 --> 54:16.053
- And your thighs.
- My thighs?

54:18.422 --> 54:21.892
- And then?
- First...

54:22.092 --> 54:25.221
- Yes?
- I'd undress you...

54:25.429 --> 54:29.525
Then I'd lick your shoulders...

54:30.309 --> 54:32.778
and move down...

54:33.020 --> 54:38.368
And then...
I'd pull out my toy train.

54:38.567 --> 54:42.913
- Your toy train?
- Write it down!

54:44.615 --> 54:46.709
What would you do
with your toy train?

54:46.909 --> 54:51.005
- You don't smoke.
- It doesn't matter.

54:51.205 --> 54:55.301
Tell me what you'd do to me.

54:57.669 --> 55:01.890
- Tell me, honey...
- Tell her!

55:04.301 --> 55:06.395
What is this toy train?

55:09.348 --> 55:11.271
Turn it down!

55:11.475 --> 55:13.569
Nicole!

55:19.650 --> 55:24.747
Rosanna... Have you worked out
what this toy train is?

55:26.406 --> 55:28.704
I think so.

55:28.909 --> 55:34.211
I heard that they make love
on a toy train.

55:34.748 --> 55:37.342
How do they do it?

55:41.338 --> 55:43.932
- Good morning, doctor.
- Good morning.

55:56.019 --> 55:58.522
There's a quicker way
to go to your house.

55:58.730 --> 56:01.654
Yes, I know.
I came here on purpose.

56:02.776 --> 56:04.653
Where are you going?

56:08.073 --> 56:12.670
I wanted to ask if you could
invite me to lunch one day

56:12.870 --> 56:16.716
to try out a typical dish
of this not-so-tiny village.

56:16.915 --> 56:21.637
- You are involved with someone.
- How do you know this?

56:21.837 --> 56:26.263
- I just know.
- That's a "no", right?

56:26.466 --> 56:28.309
Are you sure?

56:29.928 --> 56:32.022
Think about it.

56:47.696 --> 56:51.121
This is
Pietramezzana's famous mine.

56:52.910 --> 56:56.039
Hundreds of people from
this village used to work here.

56:59.833 --> 57:04.714
They extracted the rock,
then took it away in those wagons.

57:04.922 --> 57:09.223
- It's hard to work on water.
- It was dry before.

57:09.718 --> 57:13.018
Then they built the dam
and flooded the place.

57:13.221 --> 57:16.475
And now they won't even
let us fish in the lake.

57:23.774 --> 57:25.651
Watch your head.

57:28.445 --> 57:31.073
These are iron sulfur fumes.

57:31.281 --> 57:34.410
They're good
for the respiratory tract.

57:36.119 --> 57:39.544
After a 12 hour shift,
your head would be throbbing.

57:39.748 --> 57:44.879
You have to do it right. Two or three
hours here and your asthma is gone!

57:45.420 --> 57:48.549
This rotten egg smell
clings to your clothes!

57:48.757 --> 57:50.851
That's what's good for you!

57:51.843 --> 57:54.141
- Amazing!
- Let's go.

57:56.473 --> 57:58.567
REJECTED

57:58.767 --> 58:00.895
Darn it! Why?

58:01.144 --> 58:05.365
It's a lot of money and our code
of ethics does not allow us

58:05.565 --> 58:08.114
to lend money for bribes.

58:08.318 --> 58:10.366
What are you talking about?

58:11.905 --> 58:15.125
What do we do now? Let's go.

58:15.325 --> 58:18.704
Our bank manager must be busy.

58:18.912 --> 58:22.257
Because a bank manager
has a lot to do.

58:22.457 --> 58:25.381
He has lots of paper work.

58:25.585 --> 58:28.384
Yes, with all those customers.

58:28.588 --> 58:32.638
A real bank manager participates
in projects for the town.

58:32.843 --> 58:35.221
The camera is turned on.

58:35.429 --> 58:39.434
A director knows when to risk.

58:39.641 --> 58:44.021
A real bank manager dares
to tell to his boss...

58:44.187 --> 58:49.114
"I don't need forms, because
I trust my fellow countrymen!"

58:49.317 --> 58:54.323
Me too!
Mrs. Martini is watching us.

58:54.531 --> 58:57.034
A real bank manager
does all these things.

58:57.242 --> 59:00.212
Since you don't want
to do these things

59:00.412 --> 59:03.916
it means
that you are nothing but...

59:04.124 --> 59:06.798
- Don't you dare!
- An ATM.

59:07.002 --> 59:09.801
- He dared.
- Have a good day.

59:16.636 --> 59:20.937
The moment that we have
all been waiting for has arrived.

59:21.141 --> 59:24.566
The manager of the factory
will come here tonight.

59:25.479 --> 59:27.527
I want everyone to be here,

59:27.731 --> 59:30.826
and everything has to be perfect.

59:33.570 --> 59:36.494
We have to stay focused.

59:39.534 --> 59:42.037
Come on, let's go.

59:42.704 --> 59:44.297
Come.

01:00:04.392 --> 01:00:06.486
This way.

01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:11.362
- Would you like some?
- Not much. I don't drink much.

01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:16.990
- See how lively it is?
- There's a population issue.

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:19.908
We are 250 inhabitants.

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:23.246
There are only 120
registered with the tax office.

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:27.629
They're incompetent, or there
wouldn't be so much tax evasion.

01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:30.177
Who's talking to Domenico?

01:00:30.377 --> 01:00:33.927
An old supplier...

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:39.809
- Guess how many people are here.
- One hundred?

01:00:40.011 --> 01:00:43.106
Come with me.

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:44.933
Come.

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:01.783
What's going on?

01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:05.128
It's <i>8</i> o'clock.

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:08.499
- And so?
- Their favorite soap's on TV.

01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:13.922
They scared me!
I thought there was a fire.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:19.843
- Do you want to go too?
- No, I record it.

01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:46.916
We are almost there.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.258
Good evening.

01:02:11.478 --> 01:02:14.197
Who has 15?

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:17.116
No one has 15?

01:02:17.317 --> 01:02:20.241
Me! Bingo!

01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:25.079
Let's go.

01:02:27.619 --> 01:02:31.249
- Bingo!
- Good.

01:02:31.456 --> 01:02:36.053
- We are 250 inhabitants.
- Yes. Where's the restaurant?

01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:39.882
The restaurant? Why?

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:43.219
- I left my hat there.
- I'll mail it to you.

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:45.929
I'm not leaving without it.

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:49.479
- That way.
- I thought it was this way.

01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:52.527
- It's quicker that way.
- Thank you.

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:58.530
EmergerlCY!

01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:02.033
Back to the bar!

01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:07.709
I never expected you
to play cricket here.

01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:11.751
I feel like playing cricket again.

01:03:11.997 --> 01:03:15.126
Every morning after breakfast
I feel like playing cricket.

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:17.461
Right away...

01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:38.110
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:41.114
- Are you wearing my hat?
- What?

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:44.743
I don't wear hats.

01:03:45.864 --> 01:03:48.743
Do you mind giving it back to me?

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:56.045
- The doctor put it on my head.
- Thank you.

01:04:01.296 --> 01:04:05.802
- Where is everybody?
- Watching the soap on TV.

01:04:07.927 --> 01:04:11.022
Also my wife watches it.
Goodbye.

01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:16.732
This is Gianluca and Nicole's
answering machine.

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:20.236
Leave a message after the beep.
Beep!

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:28.491
- What's for dinner?
- What there was for lunch.

01:04:36.331 --> 01:04:39.084
- Yes?
- Hi, Leo.

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:43.547
- Who is he?
- His best friend.

01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:47.009
- Hi, Gianluca. How are you?
- Fine.

01:04:47.175 --> 01:04:50.349
Can ask you for a favor?

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:53.932
Can you record
the cricket match Saturday?

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:58.236
- Saturday there's a football match.
- Can't you watch it there?

01:04:58.436 --> 01:05:03.192
- I can't get a signal.
- I'll record it for you.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:08.372
We'll use Celestino's satellite dish
so he can watch cricket.

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:11.700
- What about the football match?
- Shut up.

01:05:12.826 --> 01:05:19.550
- What about the people there?
- They are all nice people.

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:24.255
I haven't felt this useful
as a doctor for years.

01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:29.138
- We are getting there!
- Listen, I wanted to ask you...

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:33.097
- Have you seen Nicole recently?
- No. Why?

01:05:33.304 --> 01:05:37.184
She is strange. She is never home.

01:05:37.392 --> 01:05:40.020
I know this is silly, but

01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:45.075
would you keep an eye on her?

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:48.370
- He trusts the guy.
- I'll do it.

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:50.789
You're a real friend.

01:05:50.989 --> 01:05:54.539
- Are you stealing my clients?
- Of course not.

01:05:55.034 --> 01:05:58.163
Just joking. Thank you.

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:03.552
To the right!

01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:06.637
- Nope.
- To the left?

01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:12.185
- It's almost done.
- Higher!

01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:16.682
- It's fine.
- Well done.

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:21.020
Stay where you are. Don't move.

01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:39.128
How good!

01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:41.457
That's a penalty!

01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:44.589
That rogue!

01:06:47.712 --> 01:06:50.010
Which version is that?

01:06:50.215 --> 01:06:54.436
If we're lucky,
this match will last five hours.

01:07:00.058 --> 01:07:04.234
Who touched the antenna?

01:07:07.649 --> 01:07:10.698
There we are.
I told you it was a penalty.

01:07:10.902 --> 01:07:14.372
- It wouldn't be cricket.
- It wouldn't be cricket!

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:18.288
It shouldn't be cricket.

01:07:20.245 --> 01:07:23.795
I'll be back. What a wonderful match!

01:07:31.923 --> 01:07:34.176
- What are you doing?
- Let go!

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:07.755
What happened? I'm coming!

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:11.137
- What happened?
- It was a false alarm.

01:08:12.547 --> 01:08:16.893
- Why did you cheer?
- The batter missed the ball

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:19.437
and we were disappointed.

01:08:21.346 --> 01:08:25.022
- Are you drunk?
- He...

01:08:25.852 --> 01:08:30.028
He is drunk! You scared me.

01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:36.287
- Let's watch the match.
- What's the score?

01:08:37.488 --> 01:08:39.707
What's the score?

01:08:39.907 --> 01:08:41.625
4-4.

01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:46.332
- Have you ever fallen from here?
- We found Nicola in Salerno, once.

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:52.002
That's incredible!

01:08:56.049 --> 01:09:00.020
- Every day I find five euros.
- Really?

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:04.767
- In the same place?
- Yes, every day!

01:09:05.015 --> 01:09:07.689
This is a lucky village.

01:09:14.524 --> 01:09:18.246
I really like it in this village.

01:09:18.446 --> 01:09:20.823
He likes it!

01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:25.499
You must stay, then!

01:09:26.245 --> 01:09:29.374
- Then you must stay.
- He is ours!

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:37.015
Here we are. Homemade.

01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:40.389
Made it with my hands
and with my heart.

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:42.687
Or rather with my feet.

01:09:44.055 --> 01:09:48.276
- I have some bad news for you.
- It's turned to vinegar?

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:51.696
No. Don't worry.
It's nothing serious.

01:09:51.895 --> 01:09:56.447
They've turned down the loan
for the second time.

01:09:56.651 --> 01:09:59.780
- What?
- Don't worry.

01:09:59.987 --> 01:10:03.161
I have important contacts.

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:05.744
When I started out in my career

01:10:06.077 --> 01:10:10.378
I worked with the father of
Mrs. Martini, the general manager.

01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:15.094
I'll give her a call,
she won't deny me the loan.

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:20.475
- Are you going to ruin it all?
- Don't worry.

01:10:20.675 --> 01:10:24.680
The doctor is happy to be here.

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:29.267
It was my idea for him
to find some money every day.

01:10:29.475 --> 01:10:32.695
We have to get him
to sign the contract.

01:10:35.106 --> 01:10:39.202
If we ask him now,
he'll get scared and won't sign.

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:43.157
The fish has taken the bait,
that was the easy part.

01:10:43.364 --> 01:10:46.459
- Now we have to land him.
- How?

01:10:46.659 --> 01:10:51.631
We have to convince him that our
boat is the best place on Earth.

01:10:52.707 --> 01:10:57.087
We'll make him jump into the boat!

01:10:57.295 --> 01:10:59.844
I have deliveries to make.

01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:03.551
- Mario will see to it.
- Let's go drink something.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:07.185
- Maybe he's fixing it.
- It's broken.

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:11.025
- Do you have other clothes?
- No, only this.

01:11:11.184 --> 01:11:15.280
- We'll take care of this.
- We are the same size.

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.859
- Let's go.
- Wait...

01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:23.037
- To the new doctor!
- Doctor Colla!

01:11:29.577 --> 01:11:33.457
Hi, Celestino. Who is that man?

01:11:33.664 --> 01:11:37.009
Our doctor for the next five years.

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:41.181
We need him in order
to have the factory built here.

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:44.509
- He's very good.
- Another liter, please.

01:11:45.343 --> 01:11:50.395
Gianluca, you can take the day off
now that Dr. Colla is here.

01:11:50.598 --> 01:11:54.728
- I don't want a day off.
- All right.

01:11:58.815 --> 01:12:02.911
- Hooray for the doctor!
- Let's toast!

01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:37.862
You spoke to Mr. Bonelli.

01:12:38.062 --> 01:12:42.693
He denied me a loan
that was a good investment.

01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:45.403
I have the paperwork here.

01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:49.616
What security can two
unemployed men give the bank?

01:12:49.824 --> 01:12:53.078
I know them personally.

01:12:53.286 --> 01:12:58.133
You've been honest for 20 years,
so I want you to know

01:12:58.332 --> 01:13:01.461
that we might replace you
with an ATM.

01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:11.396
I understand...
I'll mortgage my land.

01:13:11.596 --> 01:13:17.023
- That's not enough.
- My severance pay, then.

01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:22.031
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes.

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:27.283
Get all the paperwork ready
and then call me back.

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:30.581
- Goodbye.
- Take care.

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:01.358
You didn't go to work, today?

01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:11.490
- What's this?
- Have you robbed a bank?

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:14.075
We got the loan.

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:19.289
We'll have to pay 48 installments
of 1.141 euros.

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:23.339
- How did you do that?
- I mortgaged my land and pension.

01:14:24.919 --> 01:14:27.172
You're nuts!

01:14:27.713 --> 01:14:31.308
- Well done, Nicola!
- Is it in the bank already?

01:14:31.509 --> 01:14:36.231
- No, I took an advance.
- We must celebrate.

01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:40.731
- I don't drink.
- We need to celebrate!

01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:43.734
All we have to do now
is sign the contract.

01:14:45.106 --> 01:14:47.404
To your health.

01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:55.033
Wake up, Uncle Domenico.
Come upstairs.

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:58.211
- Let's read it out.
- No, we'll just tell him.

01:14:58.411 --> 01:15:00.505
Say that all again slowly.

01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:03.549
Gianluca called Nicole.

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:07.674
- The first time.
- She didn't answer.

01:15:09.005 --> 01:15:11.849
So he left a really long message

01:15:12.049 --> 01:15:15.679
about that toy train thing.

01:15:15.886 --> 01:15:21.063
Then he mentioned some body oil,
a cream then the train again.

01:15:21.267 --> 01:15:24.191
- Rosaria...
- Then?

01:15:24.395 --> 01:15:29.993
He started making lots of
phone calls he was going crazy...

01:15:30.568 --> 01:15:33.822
Guess whose house Nicole was at?

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:41.003
His best friend, Leo!

01:15:41.162 --> 01:15:46.089
- His best friend...
- He was also her best friend!

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:48.340
Did you get it?

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:52.299
She cheated on him for three years.

01:15:52.506 --> 01:15:55.305
What a good friend!

01:15:55.509 --> 01:15:57.853
Three years!

01:15:58.054 --> 01:16:02.309
- Their romance is over.
- It's over.

01:16:02.516 --> 01:16:06.817
- That's it.
- He has no reason to go home now.

01:16:07.021 --> 01:16:11.197
- That's what we think too.
- We were trying to explain it.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:15.780
I knew something
would happen sooner or later.

01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:19.868
We hated that Nicole so much,
and yet... she helped us!

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:22.329
Saint Nicole!

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.512
Gianluca...

01:16:40.179 --> 01:16:42.022
How are you?

01:16:43.224 --> 01:16:45.773
I broke up with my fiancé.

01:16:46.018 --> 01:16:48.692
Really? I'm sorry.

01:16:54.652 --> 01:16:59.829
My whole life
in these past few years...

01:17:00.032 --> 01:17:03.377
were nothing but a lie.

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:11.215
She would call me "love" and
then sleep with my best friend.

01:17:11.418 --> 01:17:15.048
How could I be so blind

01:17:15.256 --> 01:17:18.931
and see that is was just a lie?

01:17:19.176 --> 01:17:23.147
Everybody would lie
and I believed everything.

01:17:25.224 --> 01:17:29.070
Most of my friends
must have known.

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:34.404
I bet they found it really funny!

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:38.496
Every time I went
to the surgery room

01:17:38.696 --> 01:17:41.666
for a breast implant
or a nose job...

01:17:41.866 --> 01:17:45.871
Now that I think about it,
that is all fake too!

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:59.179
All right...

01:18:00.551 --> 01:18:03.896
- Sorry for dumping this on you.
- No...

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:15.111
Gabriele...

01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:46.514
- Good evening, Domenico.
- Good evening, Sebastiana.

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:51.649
- You're lying on top of me.
- Come on, Sebastiana.

01:18:52.561 --> 01:18:56.691
He doesn't come very often,
you can be a little patient.

01:18:57.608 --> 01:19:02.364
- Will this last long?
- No, I'll be quick.

01:19:04.114 --> 01:19:06.116
Thank you.

01:19:08.786 --> 01:19:10.459
Michele!

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:17.258
What will happen after
the doctor signs the contract?

01:19:18.379 --> 01:19:23.101
- What could happen?
- When he will find out

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.678
that it was all fake,

01:19:25.886 --> 01:19:29.356
that we lied to him for a month...

01:19:30.933 --> 01:19:34.107
They were only white lies...

01:19:37.147 --> 01:19:39.821
He's going to be hurt.

01:19:47.408 --> 01:19:50.127
We have two possibilities.

01:19:50.327 --> 01:19:53.627
We throw the fish back in the sea

01:19:53.831 --> 01:19:58.428
or, for the next five years,

01:19:58.627 --> 01:20:02.677
we'll have to be the town
Mr. Terragni thinks we are.

01:20:03.841 --> 01:20:08.847
I'm not listening to Nu Jazz for the
next 5 years. I'll kill myself, first.

01:20:11.181 --> 01:20:15.186
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

01:20:15.394 --> 01:20:19.149
And Jesus said:
"Bring me the fish to multiply..."

01:20:19.356 --> 01:20:21.450
- Doctor!
- Sorry.

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:26.201
- I didn't mean to disturb you.
- Can we help you?

01:20:26.405 --> 01:20:28.533
I just came to tell you

01:20:28.741 --> 01:20:32.291
that in this month
that I have spent here

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:36.874
I have discovered
that Pietramezzana is small,

01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:40.052
there are no big restaurants

01:20:40.252 --> 01:20:43.802
and there isn't a big night life...

01:20:44.006 --> 01:20:48.682
But I have discovered

01:20:48.886 --> 01:20:54.063
that there is
something authentic here.

01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:58.316
You're genuine people

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:02.900
and this is hard to find
in big cities.

01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:05.778
I'm sorry I interrupted you

01:21:06.403 --> 01:21:08.906
but I wanted to say

01:21:09.573 --> 01:21:13.294
that I'd be happy to be your doctor.

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:33.017
Thank you.

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:38.477
But unfortunately...

01:21:38.685 --> 01:21:42.235
Dr. Colla has already
signed the contract.

01:21:46.485 --> 01:21:48.362
I'm sorry.

01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:59.165
I understand...

01:21:59.373 --> 01:22:01.546
Then...

01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:06.555
I won't bother you any further.

01:22:07.548 --> 01:22:10.142
Forgive me.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:16.432
Domenico...

01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:48.259
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:50.216
Let's go.

01:22:55.929 --> 01:23:00.105
The prefecture...
The regional Authorities...

01:23:02.853 --> 01:23:06.278
- It's all here.
- We need the doctor's contract.

01:23:06.482 --> 01:23:08.450
You've got it.

01:23:08.650 --> 01:23:12.450
We sent it to you last week
by registered mail.

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:17.125
- To the head office?
- I thought you'd bring it.

01:23:17.326 --> 01:23:21.923
Call the office.
Do you have a copy of it?

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:24.500
Of course.

01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:26.752
I-Ii-

01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:34.100
I came here to say bye to you.

01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:36.895
Do you want to stay for lunch?

01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:40.599
I'm single again as of yesterday.

01:23:40.807 --> 01:23:42.480
I know.

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:46.530
- Domenico told you?
- No.

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:51.235
It's been a month that
we are listening to your phone calls.

01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:53.537
What do you mean?

01:23:55.656 --> 01:23:58.660
We listen to your phone calls.

01:24:00.744 --> 01:24:03.873
Why do you do this?

01:24:05.415 --> 01:24:09.170
Come inside, let's talk a little bit.

01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:15.931
- No deal without the doctor.
- Of course.

01:24:16.134 --> 01:24:19.183
With a doctor's contract
we can get EU funds.

01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:22.187
- Right.
- Mayor, you have a doctor?

01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:26.396
- Yes, we have a doctor.
- No tricks.

01:24:29.815 --> 01:24:32.284
What's a wicket in cricket?

01:24:34.319 --> 01:24:39.120
You know nothing about cricket.
You lied to me all along. Right?

01:24:40.242 --> 01:24:43.792
- You lied to me for a month!
- Well...

01:24:43.996 --> 01:24:47.751
- We were not really lying...
- What was your dead son's name?

01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:51.095
Bernardo.

01:24:51.712 --> 01:24:55.262
- Bernardo?
- Why, Domenico?

01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:02.060
I thought that we were...

01:25:04.516 --> 01:25:05.938
Gianluca...

01:25:14.067 --> 01:25:16.786
- Who was that?
- An old cricket player.

01:25:16.987 --> 01:25:19.911
- Can I see the contract?
- Sure.

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:21.867
Gianluca, stop!

01:25:25.912 --> 01:25:29.758
It's been eight years
that we don't have jobs.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.676
Every month we line up to get
an unemployment check.

01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:38.137
You get money
and a big dose of shame.

01:25:38.342 --> 01:25:42.722
The money only lasts 15 days but
the shame lasts the whole month.

01:25:42.929 --> 01:25:48.436
We needed a doctor who would
bring 120 people back to life.

01:25:51.897 --> 01:25:53.991
Weren't you 220?

01:26:30.185 --> 01:26:33.906
- Will you learn to play cricket?
- No.

01:26:46.326 --> 01:26:49.705
Gianluca Terragni will be our doctor.

01:26:52.582 --> 01:26:56.052
Where is the guy from the factory?

01:26:56.253 --> 01:27:01.180
- They won't build a factory here.
- Why?

01:27:01.383 --> 01:27:05.559
The contract mentions an office,
not a production line.

01:27:05.762 --> 01:27:08.936
They never intended
to build a factory here.

01:27:10.183 --> 01:27:14.108
They might have hired
a janitor or some cleaners.

01:27:14.312 --> 01:27:17.782
After all this tragedy,
at least I saved my money.

01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:22.283
And now?

01:27:25.824 --> 01:27:30.375
I'll be in the office tomorrow.
Mrs. Cerami has confirmed.

01:27:30.579 --> 01:27:34.174
Be there tomorrow morning.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.096
All right. See you tomorrow. Bye.

01:28:13.538 --> 01:28:16.667
- It's you.
- There's a problem.

01:28:16.875 --> 01:28:20.345
- Is someone sick?
- No, there was a landslide.

01:28:20.545 --> 01:28:25.142
Another? What will I do?
How will I catch my train?

01:28:25.342 --> 01:28:27.845
There's the direct route.

01:28:29.679 --> 01:28:35.436
I'm sorry, I have to leave.
I've got so much work to do.

01:28:36.603 --> 01:28:38.901
Thank you everyone.

01:28:39.105 --> 01:28:42.075
I'm sorry about your jobs.

01:28:42.275 --> 01:28:46.655
Don't make us regret
that we rejected that rascal.

01:28:47.864 --> 01:28:50.743
Here we have nothing
but good health.

01:28:50.992 --> 01:28:55.372
- If they take that away too...
- Can I call you, if I need help?

01:28:55.580 --> 01:29:00.381
Of course, that goes for everyone.
Just call me and I'll be here.

01:29:04.548 --> 01:29:07.142
Thanks again. Bye.

01:29:15.475 --> 01:29:20.481
- It wouldn't be cricket!
- It wouldn't be cricket!

01:30:20.874 --> 01:30:23.002
But...

01:30:54.574 --> 01:30:57.293
- Welcome, queer...
- Is he talking to me?

01:30:57.494 --> 01:30:59.462
Indeed!

01:31:12.509 --> 01:31:16.264
The dream we had for the mine
came true in the end.

01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:22.194
We put into practice
the idea of Gianluca, our doctor.

01:31:22.394 --> 01:31:26.444
That is: make the most
of what we already had.

01:31:29.025 --> 01:31:32.199
Good morning.
The changing room is on the right.

01:31:34.447 --> 01:31:38.202
Welcome to
Pietramezzana's Thermal Complex.

01:31:38.410 --> 01:31:42.165
This used to be a mine,
then, when it was used up,

01:31:42.372 --> 01:31:45.626
they built a dam
and flooded the tunnels.

01:31:48.461 --> 01:31:53.058
This place does miracles.
Not for everyone, darling.

01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:58.147
- You need a miracle, not me!
- No!

01:32:01.474 --> 01:32:03.192
What are you doing?

01:32:16.531 --> 01:32:20.911
Me? An ATM?
I'll show you who is an ATM!

01:32:43.641 --> 01:32:46.690
- Can I see you tonight?
- No way!

01:32:46.895 --> 01:32:49.444
Take your time,
we've our whole lives in front of us!

01:32:58.364 --> 01:33:03.086
We are not rich
but we are back to living

01:33:03.286 --> 01:33:07.587
with our heads held high
and with the desire to dream.
