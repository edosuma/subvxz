WEBVTT

00:01.280 --> 00:04.960
Maybe I can arrange something.
For information about your friend.

00:09.680 --> 00:13.040
You know Nikki.
Always needs more time than others do.

00:13.240 --> 00:15.480
There are certain subjects
you have to avoid.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.200
If she gets hysterical again,
we'll get nowhere at all.

00:18.400 --> 00:23.480
So you may only talk to her about
these things. Sign at the bottom please.

00:23.680 --> 00:27.960
"I love you. I need you.
Yours always, Rita."

00:29.480 --> 00:31.360
I don't trust Benoit anymore.

00:32.840 --> 00:33.920
Oh, Mie.

00:34.240 --> 00:36.200
They give me these here.
- Yes?

00:36.840 --> 00:41.200
They're worried I'll commit suicide
because I've tried before.

00:43.360 --> 00:45.000
Sorry, it's an old habit.

00:48.960 --> 00:49.760
Vronsky.

00:49.960 --> 00:52.720
Mie D'Haeze faked the hypnosis session.

00:52.920 --> 00:56.880
Instead of tormenting Mie, you'd be
better off checking up on her old man.

02:14.320 --> 02:18.000
THE WOODS FOR THE TREES

02:25.400 --> 02:28.600
You're losing, my dear contestant.

02:29.720 --> 02:32.440
Are your shoes filling with sand?

02:35.360 --> 02:37.080
And now...

02:38.200 --> 02:40.320
the ultimate question.

02:43.880 --> 02:50.080
Who caused Thomas Spectre
to vanish into thin air?

03:08.880 --> 03:12.480
Who was it, oh, who was it, Mie?

03:13.800 --> 03:19.440
Have you got sand in your ears?
For the final time,

03:19.640 --> 03:26.600
who murdered Thomas Spectre?

03:29.560 --> 03:36.320
Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

03:36.520 --> 03:41.320
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.840
Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

03:45.720 --> 03:48.280
TODAY
12 DECEMBER

03:48.480 --> 03:53.520
Mie? You've got a visitor. OK?
- OK.

03:57.160 --> 04:00.680
It's high time we had a proper talk.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.600
Don't you agree?

04:06.280 --> 04:08.960
You said my wife would be here too.

04:09.160 --> 04:12.600
People don't always tell the truth,
Mr D'Haeze.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.280
You should know that.

04:15.680 --> 04:16.960
Where is Mie?

04:20.200 --> 04:21.600
Sit down.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.440
Pardon?
- Sit down.

04:26.160 --> 04:29.680
You can always come with me
to the station, if you want.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.080
I thought we would be on
more neutral ground here.

04:46.640 --> 04:49.360
I want to go over
your comings and goings again.

04:49.960 --> 04:52.560
In the days just before
Spectre disappeared.

04:53.280 --> 04:56.040
Why am I being questioned again?

04:56.680 --> 05:00.040
Because telling a lie
is quickly done, Mr D'Haeze.

05:00.240 --> 05:03.600
But the truth takes more time.

05:04.200 --> 05:07.920
I think it started from
when I knew Romy was dead.

05:08.120 --> 05:12.240
What was different about his behaviour?
- He became more distant.

05:13.200 --> 05:17.200
Was it during the same period
that you met Thomas Spectre?

05:17.400 --> 05:19.360
I think so.

05:19.560 --> 05:24.600
Yes, Benoit found out that
Tom and I saw each other. And he...

05:26.560 --> 05:32.480
He reacted very badly to it, in a way that
was unfamiliar to me. Quite destructive.

05:32.680 --> 05:37.160
You and Spectre weren't exactly
good friends, were you? Eh?

05:39.640 --> 05:43.680
Honeybird, on the other hand...
she got on well with him.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.600
Very well, in fact.

05:49.640 --> 05:54.160
Suppose Thomas Spectre fucked your wife.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.720
I can imagine...
- Fuck you.

05:57.400 --> 06:01.320
Fuck you, pal. You bastard!
- ... you would be furious.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.240
You can't accuse me of anything.
- No?

06:03.440 --> 06:06.560
No.
- Aggravated assault.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.240
Little witnesses sometimes
only come forward later.

06:12.960 --> 06:17.920
You were seen at the recycling yard. And
you weren't there recycling your rubbish.

06:18.400 --> 06:23.440
So I have good reason
to check your alibi again.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.560
OK.

06:30.600 --> 06:35.280
I was at work. I already told you that.
But check it again.

06:35.480 --> 06:38.800
If we're going to continue this
conversation we'll do so at the station.

06:39.240 --> 06:41.000
No problem.
- With a lawyer.

06:41.200 --> 06:45.920
Maybe you should file a second complaint.
Halting the investigation would suit you.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.440
Shit!

06:50.640 --> 06:53.480
How is your relationship with your father?
- With my father?

06:53.680 --> 06:55.760
Yes. What kind of person is your father?

06:55.960 --> 06:59.840
My father has always been
a very calm, patient man.

07:00.240 --> 07:05.560
Very different from Benoit.
Ã… brilliant neurologist.

07:05.760 --> 07:10.240
It's ironic, you dedicate your whole life
to healing people's brain

07:10.440 --> 07:12.480
and then you get Alzheimer's.

07:13.040 --> 07:15.920
Do you often compare your situation
to that of your father?

07:16.120 --> 07:19.800
Yeah. It's... It's different, but...

07:20.000 --> 07:23.800
It has brought us closer together.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.760
Even without my problems I've always been
more like my father than my mother.

07:28.080 --> 07:31.080
Oh, in what way?
- I just have.

07:31.440 --> 07:35.640
My mother is... How shall I put it?

07:36.760 --> 07:38.760
Not easy to get on with.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.760
THE DAY OF THE DISAPPEARANCE

07:45.960 --> 07:50.360
It belonged to my mother.
- Could you not interfere for once?

07:50.560 --> 07:53.200
I'm not interfering.
This is my house, my daughter.

07:53.400 --> 07:56.720
I'm needed here.
- You value yourself too highly, Rita.

07:56.920 --> 07:59.520
Hey, you're out of control.

07:59.920 --> 08:04.800
Do you know how much that's worth?
- You broke that pot yourself.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.040
It's not all you've broken in the family.
- Pardon? Why do you say that?

08:10.240 --> 08:13.280
I'm the one who has to
mend things around here, I am.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.880
And I'll tell you how it all started.
- Right.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.480
It was when you let your dick
rule your head

08:20.680 --> 08:22.880
while my daughter suffered from depression

08:23.080 --> 08:25.000
because she was at her wits' end
with Romy.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.600
And sir here had to go and fuck his ex.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.040
What are you on about now?
Yes, that happened.

08:32.240 --> 08:35.320
Ages ago. You tackled me about it
back then, and rightly so.

08:35.520 --> 08:38.240
And I had nothing more to do
with Veronique from then on.

08:38.440 --> 08:42.840
No, pal, don't lie. Don't try to make out
you behaved better than you did.

08:43.040 --> 08:47.400
You only stopped having the affair
when Annemie took an overdose.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.480
No.
- Yes. Only then...

08:49.680 --> 08:54.160
Only then was it brought home to you.
- That's got nothing to do with it. OK?

08:54.920 --> 08:58.280
You... You don't deserve Annemie.
You're a coward.

08:58.480 --> 09:01.600
You're a coward and a liar and a cheat.

09:01.800 --> 09:07.040
Who here is the cheat? Who climbs on top
of her sick husband's nurse every night?

09:07.240 --> 09:10.800
It's not what you think. It's...
- Who is playing her daughter for a fool?

09:11.000 --> 09:14.280
It was a joint decision.
- I'm not talking about Romy,

09:14.480 --> 09:17.120
I'm talking about much longer ago.

09:18.080 --> 09:20.120
What?
- Who was pregnant

09:20.320 --> 09:23.880
by some crazy loser or other
and found herself a wealthy neurologist

09:24.080 --> 09:26.280
and made him think
he was going to be a father?

09:26.800 --> 09:30.800
You're imagining things.
- You defy imagination, Rita.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.760
How did you find out?

09:32.960 --> 09:37.560
You should've thrown away your old love
letters before you started seeing Walter.

09:38.360 --> 09:43.760
And I... I married Annemie
because I love her.

09:44.720 --> 09:46.880
You can't say that about your Walter,
can you?

09:47.080 --> 09:52.400
I love my husband. OK, it wasn't love
at first sight. I admit that.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.560
But I've come to love him
over the years

09:54.760 --> 09:59.160
and my daughters have had
a fantastic father.

10:00.440 --> 10:04.440
He was my guy. I looked up to him.

10:05.560 --> 10:09.960
It's the goddamn Alzheimer's
that has fucked up everything.

10:10.160 --> 10:13.560
And the situation with Annemie
and my granddaughter being dead

10:13.760 --> 10:18.960
are what has wrecked the family,
not me. But go ahead...

10:19.880 --> 10:24.120
destroy the little that there is left.

10:32.600 --> 10:36.840
THE BEAR PIT
CABIN IN WOODS NOW!

10:43.640 --> 10:47.600
No. Walter isn't my father.
Benoit is cheating on me with Veronique.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.800
Walter isn't my father.

10:54.680 --> 10:58.320
Walter isn't my father.
Benoit is cheating on me with Veronique.

11:01.360 --> 11:05.960
Walter isn't my father.
Benoit is cheating on me with Veronique.

11:07.320 --> 11:09.240
Walter isn't my father.

11:11.960 --> 11:15.120
Walter isn't my father.
Benoit is cheating on me with Veronique.

11:15.320 --> 11:18.840
Walter isn't my father.
Benoit is cheating on me with Veronique.

11:19.040 --> 11:23.120
Walter isn't my father.
Benoit is cheating on me with Veronique.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.600
Walter isn't my father.

11:46.640 --> 11:50.240
Benoit is cheating on me
with V... Veronique.

11:50.440 --> 11:53.840
Walter isn't... my father.

11:57.480 --> 12:00.800
Benoit is cheating on me with... V...
Walter isn't... my father.

12:07.440 --> 12:12.640
Walter isn't my father. Benoit is cheating
on me. Walter isn't my father.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.520
Walter isn't my father.
Walter isn't my father.

12:16.720 --> 12:22.000
Walter isn't my father. Walter isn't
my father. Walter isn't my father.

12:22.200 --> 12:26.920
Walter isn't my father.
Walter... isn't my father.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.560
Walter isn't my father.

12:31.760 --> 12:34.360
Walter isn't my father.

12:35.680 --> 12:37.840
Walter isn't my father.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.280
Walter isn't my father.

12:50.120 --> 12:54.720
Walter isn't my father.
Walter isn't my father.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.320
Walter isn't my father.

13:00.240 --> 13:01.720
Walter isn't my father.

13:01.920 --> 13:05.000
CABIN IN WOODS NOW!
MESSAGE SENT 43 MINUTES AGO

13:48.160 --> 13:50.800
Mummy, this is our secret camp.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.080
Our secret camp.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.720
TODAY
12 DECEMBER

15:18.400 --> 15:22.400
THE DAY OF THE DISAPPEARANCE

15:38.120 --> 15:42.400
What happened?
- Nothing. An accident at work.

15:52.320 --> 15:53.560
You've been in a fight.

15:58.320 --> 16:01.320
Did Benoit do that?
- It's my own fault.

16:03.080 --> 16:06.880
Why?
- We have to stop this, Mie.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.080
It's not right.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.600
So why are you here then?

16:22.600 --> 16:25.280
Go back to your life with your husband.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.760
I want to be with you.

16:32.360 --> 16:36.480
Goddammit, Mie. That's not possible.

16:36.680 --> 16:40.280
I'm not who you want me to be.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.720
No one is who they say they are anymore.

16:53.240 --> 16:55.360
We have to stop this.

17:25.920 --> 17:29.440
TODAY
12 DECEMBER

17:34.800 --> 17:35.760
Wolkers speaking.

17:35.960 --> 17:39.600
Where are you? I told you
I wanted to speak to you about the case.

17:39.800 --> 17:40.760
I'm listening.

17:40.960 --> 17:44.960
No, I don't want you to listen. I want you
to come and report to me in my office!

17:45.160 --> 17:46.720
It's that simple.

17:47.440 --> 17:49.880
Hello?
- I have to go, chief.

17:50.080 --> 17:54.560
I'll come first thing tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow? No way. You will come now...

18:01.200 --> 18:02.200
<i>Don't you...</i>

18:02.400 --> 18:04.040
<i>THE DAY OF THE DISAPPEARANCE</i>

18:04.240 --> 18:09.800
<i>... forget about me.
- About me</i>. Annemie.

18:17.760 --> 18:20.520
Think about what you feel for me today.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.960
I feel good...

18:25.880 --> 18:29.560
with you.
- Hold onto that.

18:31.880 --> 18:33.600
Why are you saying that?

18:37.240 --> 18:39.960
Because this is who I really am.

18:42.720 --> 18:46.400
Idiot.
- Promise?

18:50.920 --> 18:52.440
Promise.

19:11.240 --> 19:12.960
I want to leave.

19:14.200 --> 19:17.440
Aren't we fine lying here?
- Yes.

19:21.120 --> 19:25.200
I want to leave with you. Get away
from here, get away from everything.

19:26.320 --> 19:27.920
Don't say that.

19:33.400 --> 19:36.360
I want to be with you.
- Me too.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.240
But you can't just run away.

19:42.600 --> 19:44.320
What is there to keep me here?

19:47.760 --> 19:49.800
I've lost my child.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.800
My husband isn't the man I married
and my mum is telling lies.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.080
My father isn't my real father.
What is there to keep me here? Eh?

20:01.680 --> 20:03.760
I want to leave with you.

20:07.800 --> 20:09.960
I love you.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.040
OK.
- OK.

20:25.720 --> 20:29.120
I'm going to go and say goodbye
to my father and get my things.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.120
Back here at 4 o'clock?

20:33.600 --> 20:35.960
Yes.
- See you then.

20:37.840 --> 20:40.600
Go on, go home and get your things too.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.440
How are you today?

21:07.880 --> 21:11.600
I can't even remember
what I ate this morning.

21:12.360 --> 21:16.600
And I don't know what day it is today.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.520
But what I do still know

21:23.360 --> 21:26.200
is that when you were little,
at the beach,

21:26.400 --> 21:30.000
you trod in dog poo
while wearing open sandals.

21:30.400 --> 21:35.120
And I had to clean your little toes
there on the breakwater.

21:35.320 --> 21:39.320
Because the stench made Rita feel sick.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.720
Dad, can I ask you something?
- No.

21:48.920 --> 21:51.720
You can't have the last chocolate.

21:54.440 --> 21:57.280
There aren't many moments like this.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.760
Soon there may not be any anymore.

22:01.960 --> 22:06.520
You're lucky. Now is the moment,
today is a good day.

22:11.760 --> 22:16.360
You and Mum...
You'd only just met

22:17.600 --> 22:20.400
and Mum got pregnant immediately with me.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.920
Did you never wonder about that?

22:28.760 --> 22:33.760
Is the colour yellow
round or square?

22:37.480 --> 22:42.680
What does it matter
if yellow is your favourite colour?

22:45.040 --> 22:48.560
Your mum may be a bit loopy but...

22:50.120 --> 22:55.400
she is the love of my life.
And she gave me two wonderful daughters.

22:55.600 --> 22:58.680
And my disease can never
take that away from me.

23:00.960 --> 23:02.600
There are days...

23:03.480 --> 23:06.400
when my mind is muddled, Mie.

23:07.880 --> 23:11.640
But in lucid moments like this

23:11.840 --> 23:18.360
I consider myself lucky that
no matter where my confused mind is...

23:19.200 --> 23:23.560
my three women will always be with me.

23:31.320 --> 23:33.040
Oh, Dad.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.320
That looked really cosy,
the two of you out there.

23:42.520 --> 23:45.000
What were you talking about?
- About you.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.000
Oh.

23:47.200 --> 23:51.560
About how, all my life, since I was born,
you've been lying to me.

23:53.440 --> 23:57.840
Did Benoit say something?
- To Dad, to me, to Nikki.

23:58.040 --> 24:00.000
And to yourself.

24:00.200 --> 24:03.680
Annemie, sit down a moment.
- If Dad isn't my father,

24:03.880 --> 24:07.880
then you are no longer my mother.
- What did you say?

24:08.480 --> 24:12.720
All my life I've...
- All my life I've heard you say

24:13.280 --> 24:15.960
how everything is always down to you.

24:16.160 --> 24:19.680
How you put yourself last.
Behind Dad, behind me, behind everyone.

24:19.880 --> 24:24.320
Annemie, will you listen a moment?
- You're only interested in yourself.

24:24.520 --> 24:26.360
In myself?
- Yes.

24:26.560 --> 24:30.760
I do nothing but look after everyone else.
- You're like a spoiled brat. Eh?

24:33.920 --> 24:38.360
There's someone out there who loves you.
Loves you a lot.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.800
And you don't even realize.

24:42.000 --> 24:46.280
What do you know about that, eh?
What do you really know about that?

24:46.480 --> 24:47.640
Mum...

24:52.880 --> 24:57.160
you are a lucky woman.
You should realize that.

24:57.920 --> 24:59.800
And enjoy him.

25:00.960 --> 25:02.520
While you still can.

26:12.840 --> 26:16.280
TODAY
12 DECEMBER

26:19.480 --> 26:21.080
Hi.
- Nikki.

26:22.880 --> 26:25.760
Sorry I didn't come before.

26:26.880 --> 26:29.400
But I couldn't play the game
like everyone else.

26:29.600 --> 26:31.360
I know she's dead.

26:35.640 --> 26:39.640
But it's not just that.
- What? What's the matter?

26:39.840 --> 26:44.040
I shouldn't be here. I mustn't tell you...
- Nikki, what's the matter?

26:45.600 --> 26:50.400
Mie, you have to remember
what happened to that Thomas Spectre.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.560
Otherwise you're in deep shit.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.000
You're not only the last link to that guy

26:59.200 --> 27:03.960
but you also have a motive.
- Benoit has a motive, not me.

27:04.600 --> 27:08.200
No, Mie, you both have one
but you've just forgotten.

27:14.120 --> 27:15.720
If Dad isn't my father...

27:15.920 --> 27:19.840
What are you saying?
- That's why Tom was always so distant

27:20.040 --> 27:23.800
and why he was always so mysterious
about his past.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.480
The feeling that I knew him from somewhere
and Benoit behaving so strangely...

27:29.000 --> 27:31.400
Nikki, Thomas Spectre is my brother.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.680
No.
- Yes.

27:33.880 --> 27:36.480
He's my half-brother.
Like you're my half-sister.

27:36.680 --> 27:40.360
Mie, stop it.
They're poisoning your mind in here.

27:40.560 --> 27:44.960
Thomas isn't your brother.
- I'm going crazy.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.000
Shhh. Hey...

27:47.200 --> 27:51.280
I no longer know what's real and
what isn't, Sis. I don't know anymore.

27:56.320 --> 28:00.440
Do you remember
that last argument with Benoit? Eh?

28:01.240 --> 28:04.720
Before they found you in the woods.
Do you remember it?

28:04.920 --> 28:10.320
You wanted to run away with Thomas. You
wanted to leave Benoit for him. Remember?

28:23.200 --> 28:27.160
THE DAY OF THE DISAPPEARANCE

28:44.320 --> 28:49.080
Hi.
- Hi. What happened here?

28:51.200 --> 28:52.680
It was... an accident.

28:56.080 --> 28:59.080
And sir here had to go and fuck his ex.

29:01.560 --> 29:03.680
Benoit, I'm leaving you.

29:14.240 --> 29:15.440
Why?

29:17.720 --> 29:21.760
Because I don't love you anymore.
- You do still love me, Mie.

29:21.960 --> 29:25.600
You're just a bit confused at the moment.
- Don't treat me like a backward child.

29:25.800 --> 29:28.760
I know more than you think.
- Is it that Thomas?

29:30.640 --> 29:33.320
You haven't loved me
for a long time either.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.120
Don't say things like that.

29:41.520 --> 29:44.440
What about that Veronique then? Eh?

29:47.880 --> 29:48.840
Yeah...

29:50.120 --> 29:54.520
Yeah, it happened. A long time ago.
After...

29:58.000 --> 30:01.560
After you tried to commit suicide
I had nothing more to do with Veronique.

30:01.760 --> 30:05.880
I needed someone then. I needed you.
- I'm here now.

30:07.160 --> 30:12.080
You have to stop lying, Benoit,
you really do. I found your card.

30:12.280 --> 30:15.240
It's not over
between you and that Veronique.

30:16.200 --> 30:19.880
It is over.
I just lied about that card so that...

30:20.080 --> 30:22.200
Stop lying.
I don't need to hear your excuses.

30:22.400 --> 30:25.800
That woman keeps trying to get in touch
but I ignore her, Mie.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.160
Oh, wow.
I'm supposed to be pleased, or what?

30:45.280 --> 30:46.800
I don't know anymore.

30:53.160 --> 30:55.280
I don't know anymore.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.320
You're right.

31:13.200 --> 31:17.000
It's not working. It's not working
between us. We can't do this. This...

31:23.440 --> 31:27.080
If you really want to leave
then you should leave.

31:35.280 --> 31:36.520
Sorry.

31:41.120 --> 31:43.600
Go and fuck our daughter's killer.

31:46.640 --> 31:47.800
What did you say?

31:54.120 --> 31:56.440
Thomas Spectre is the drunk...

31:57.560 --> 32:00.320
who drove into your car, Mie.

32:09.480 --> 32:11.080
That's not true.

32:13.200 --> 32:14.800
You're lying.

32:19.120 --> 32:22.200
You are. You're lying.

32:27.360 --> 32:29.520
Tell me you're lying.

32:30.720 --> 32:32.120
Tell me you're lying.

32:39.240 --> 32:40.840
I'm not lying.

32:49.920 --> 32:52.040
MUSICAL STAR'S CAREER CRASHES

32:52.240 --> 32:54.400
He went to prison for three months.

32:54.600 --> 32:58.800
He paid a fortune in fines,
compensation...

33:01.000 --> 33:02.680
And that's my motive.

33:04.440 --> 33:07.640
You said you'd met a Tom but...

33:07.840 --> 33:12.000
If I'd known it was that Thomas,
I could have stopped you.

33:13.240 --> 33:18.640
Benoit eventually found out and
tried to solve it the Benoit way.

33:18.840 --> 33:22.080
How?
- By keeping you out of it.

33:23.680 --> 33:28.360
He went and threatened him physically.
But Thomas didn't give up.

33:28.560 --> 33:32.200
So Benoit finally had to tell you.

33:32.400 --> 33:35.720
But I don't know what you did after that.
- Nothing.

33:35.920 --> 33:40.640
I didn't do anything. I wouldn't do
anything terrible. You know me, eh?

33:43.720 --> 33:47.160
Are you sure Benoit didn't do
any more than that?

33:54.600 --> 33:57.360
Madam, you didn't
sign the papers properly.

33:57.800 --> 34:00.760
The police require all visitors to sign...
- Yeah, I'm coming.

34:06.960 --> 34:08.360
Mie...

34:09.760 --> 34:12.800
you have to remember what happened.

34:13.000 --> 34:16.400
So you can get out of here.
- I know.

34:18.560 --> 34:20.200
I have to get out of here.

34:21.160 --> 34:22.720
I have to get out of here.

34:39.600 --> 34:46.200
Hello. Yes. Uh... fifteen minutes later.
Quarter to eight? Right.

34:46.840 --> 34:51.080
OK. Yes. I'll just write it down.

34:54.040 --> 34:56.760
Mie? Annemie D'Haeze.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.040
Were we going for a walk?
Do you mind if I come with you?

35:02.360 --> 35:07.000
I know you're keeping things from me.
I know you faked that hypnosis.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.000
Why?

35:09.440 --> 35:13.280
What on earth are you scared of?
- I'm not scared.

35:15.120 --> 35:19.880
I have nothing left to lose. Because
your son took everything away from me.

35:21.440 --> 35:26.360
And maybe we wouldn't have been here now
if you'd been a good father to him.

35:30.440 --> 35:33.400
I know what my son did was terrible

35:33.600 --> 35:36.040
but you and I have to...
- I don't have to do anything.

35:36.240 --> 35:38.400
And you have to leave me alone.

35:39.560 --> 35:41.840
I don't know where your child is.

35:43.080 --> 35:45.920
But I have lost mine forever.

36:25.200 --> 36:27.840
How does Wolkers know
I faked the hypnosis?

36:34.920 --> 36:36.560
You ratted on me.

36:39.200 --> 36:40.920
Who are you?

36:43.720 --> 36:46.440
Are we going to play that game?
Are we going to play Who Am I?

36:48.640 --> 36:50.040
I'm Mie.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.760
I'm your friend.

36:53.800 --> 36:57.880
And you?
- Me? Jan Peeters.

36:58.080 --> 37:01.280
I'll tell you who you are.
You are a dirty rat.

37:02.200 --> 37:03.760
Vronsky the rat.

37:10.080 --> 37:12.160
Where are my papers?

37:14.720 --> 37:16.560
Papers?

37:16.760 --> 37:20.320
There's a page missing from
my medical records. I want it back.

37:20.520 --> 37:25.120
Only one lunatic in here rips pages
out of books and that's you.

37:27.400 --> 37:30.400
Was there something on it
I wasn't allowed to know?

38:58.680 --> 39:01.560
Here you are.
- Thank you. Bye.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.600
Hi, Omar.
- Hi, Mie.

39:29.160 --> 39:33.560
Um, Mie, this is my mother, Fatima.
- Go on, take one. Try one.

39:33.880 --> 39:37.040
No, no, I don't want to disturb you.
- You're not disturbing us.

39:37.400 --> 39:39.760
Come on, join us.
- Sit down.

39:40.120 --> 39:42.200
Would you like a drink?
- A coffee, please.

39:42.400 --> 39:44.520
A tea.
- Tea? OK.

39:44.720 --> 39:46.080
Thanks.

39:57.640 --> 40:01.400
Can I help you, Mie?
- No. No, thank you.

40:12.960 --> 40:14.640
How do you says "cheers"?

40:14.960 --> 40:17.240
<i>Saha.
- Saha. Saha.</i>

40:21.640 --> 40:23.880
<i>And "thank you"?</i> Shu...
- Shukran.

40:24.080 --> 40:28.520
Shukran. <i>And "sorry"?
- Um</i>... Smeh-li.

40:28.720 --> 40:31.680
<i>Smeh-li. Smeh-li.</i>

40:35.240 --> 40:38.280
<i>What's wrong, Mum?
- I feel a bit dizzy.</i>

40:38.480 --> 40:41.520
She's feeling a bit dizzy.
- Oh dear.

40:42.560 --> 40:45.880
Maybe I should take her to the toilet.

40:46.680 --> 40:53.160
Yes. Mum, let her take you to the toilet.
- Yes. Yeah.

41:18.520 --> 41:21.760
SORRY

42:05.120 --> 42:07.480
Thank you for the lift. Bye.

45:23.280 --> 45:24.520
Hi.

45:26.480 --> 45:28.000
I've run away.

45:30.200 --> 45:33.600
At... At the recycling centre.
Where Tom lives.

45:35.480 --> 45:37.960
Sorry, but I just had to
get out of there.

45:39.800 --> 45:43.480
Uh... No. No. I only want to see you.

46:00.560 --> 46:04.120
Mie, everyone is looking for you.
You have to go back now.

46:06.200 --> 46:10.000
I want to go to where my accident happened
first, then I'll go back.

46:10.600 --> 46:13.240
I don't know where that was.

46:14.880 --> 46:16.960
You can find out.

46:22.280 --> 46:26.360
I'm not allowed to do that.
The police are looking for you.

46:26.560 --> 46:30.440
I know Tom caused my accident.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.640
You know what he did?

46:33.840 --> 46:39.120
I know something was going on between us.
And Benoit found out.

46:41.280 --> 46:43.000
I have to go there.

46:44.120 --> 46:47.560
I have to remember.
I want to be able to put an end to this.

46:52.760 --> 46:56.320
If you call the police now
I'll tell them you gave me a mobile phone

46:56.520 --> 46:58.560
and that's how I managed to escape.

46:59.280 --> 47:01.440
Don't you trust me, Mie?

47:04.440 --> 47:06.240
Wait in the car.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.800
Do you want me to come too?

49:14.320 --> 49:16.320
Did it help?

49:18.680 --> 49:19.920
Yes.

49:20.640 --> 49:22.720
Have you remembered anything else?

49:25.480 --> 49:29.520
No.
- Nothing about Thomas Spectre?

49:31.360 --> 49:32.760
Will you be OK?

49:36.200 --> 49:37.440
Yes.

49:39.320 --> 49:40.640
Thank you.

49:50.040 --> 49:53.440
Is... Is Omar's mum OK?
- Yes, she's OK.

49:53.640 --> 49:56.440
But we'll talk about it tomorrow.
Go to sleep now.

49:56.640 --> 49:57.680
Yeah.

49:58.200 --> 50:00.800
Can you give her her clothes back?
- Yeah.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.200
He's been burnt without... without flames.

51:22.400 --> 51:24.560
Do you think he'll make it?
- I don't know.

51:24.760 --> 51:27.560
He was burnt all over.
Only his legs were OK.

51:27.760 --> 51:31.480
Yes, his legs were still fine.
- Mie, are you OK?

51:33.160 --> 51:35.040
Come on,
I'll take you back to your room.

51:36.120 --> 51:37.280
Come on.

51:47.960 --> 51:49.600
NEXT TIME

51:49.800 --> 51:50.800
24 hours.

51:53.440 --> 51:55.840
You're looking for a scapegoat.
- You have a motive.

51:56.040 --> 52:00.920
You have to remember. Now is the time.
There is no other way. You have to do it.

52:01.120 --> 52:04.240
How did a pyromaniac get hold of
a model airplane and methanol?

52:06.800 --> 52:08.040
Can we play a game?

52:08.240 --> 52:12.720
You're focussing too much on the accident.
You should concentrate on Thomas Spectre.

52:12.920 --> 52:14.680
But the two are connected.

52:15.320 --> 52:19.680
Can't you see through him? He knows
everything. He's done something to Tom.

52:19.880 --> 52:21.200
Fuck.
