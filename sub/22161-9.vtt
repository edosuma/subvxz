00:09.092 --> 00:10.343
{\an7}&gt;&gt; I THOUGHT OUR SENIOR TRIP

00:10.427 --> 00:11.761

00:11.845 --> 00:13.179
{\an7}BLAST BEFORE GRADUATION,

00:13.263 --> 00:13.763
{\an7}UNTIL I FOUND OUT

00:13.847 --> 00:14.806

00:24.315 --> 00:25.900
{\an7}ANNOYING VOICE THE WHOLE TIME.

{\an7}&gt;&gt; STEPHEN, I WENT TO CAMP.

00:26.526 --> 00:27.485
{\an7}I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

00:27.569 --> 00:28.611
{\an7}&gt;&gt; OH, YEAH, AND WE WERE
