00:03.786 --> 00:06.615
Look at my sexy lady
on her business trip.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.400
How's it going
up in San Francisco?

00:09.444 --> 00:10.749
CLAIRE:
Well, it's a sports bar,

00:10.793 --> 00:12.969
so the redesign's
pretty simple.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.492
I'm basically
just putting in everything

00:14.536 --> 00:16.538
eight-year-old you would have
wanted in our house.

00:17.887 --> 00:19.715
Anyway, I can't believe
your dad decided to make

00:19.758 --> 00:22.239
a last minute trip;
that's so not like him.

00:22.283 --> 00:23.893
Yeah, he loves planning ahead.

00:23.936 --> 00:25.503
In third grade, they asked him
what he wanted to be

00:25.547 --> 00:28.898
when he grew up, and he said,
"15 minutes early."

00:28.941 --> 00:30.508
Well, I'm bummed to miss him.

00:30.552 --> 00:32.249
You guys are so cute together.

00:32.293 --> 00:34.077
You sing the same songs,

00:34.121 --> 00:36.253
and tell jokes and work stories,

00:36.297 --> 00:39.822
you're always dancing.
[laughs]

00:39.865 --> 00:42.912
You know what, actually, I'm
fine to be missing this weekend.

00:43.826 --> 00:45.828
But I am sad to be missing

00:45.871 --> 00:48.657
our little Saturday night
routine.

00:48.700 --> 00:51.921
Ooh. You mean,
60 minutes of intense,

00:51.964 --> 00:54.228
mind-bending pleasure?

00:54.271 --> 00:57.970
[laughs] More like seven minutes
of that,

00:58.014 --> 01:00.321
followed by 53 of us just
housing Ben & Jerry's.

01:03.324 --> 01:06.544
Well, either way,
this hubby's getting chubby.

01:06.588 --> 01:08.198
Well, you know, we could, uh,

01:08.242 --> 01:11.158
try a little something
over FaceTime.

01:11.201 --> 01:13.116
Ooh, you bad.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.379
I'm about to get all up
in that bandwidth.

01:15.423 --> 01:17.990
'Cause you know you drive me
crazy even in pixel form.

01:18.034 --> 01:21.037
With those gorgeous eyes
and that adorable--

01:21.081 --> 01:23.909
Hold on, Cooper's in the house.

01:23.953 --> 01:25.563
Okay.

01:25.607 --> 01:27.391
Cooper, you've met my spouse,
Claire Davis.

01:27.435 --> 01:29.915
Hi, Claire.Hi.

01:29.959 --> 01:32.135
Don't mind Jake. He gets weird
when people hear us

01:32.179 --> 01:33.745
being romantic on the phone.

01:33.789 --> 01:37.793
All right, well,
bye, Jakey-poo. I love you.

01:37.836 --> 01:39.447
My little buttercup,
you're just so cute.

01:39.490 --> 01:43.929
Interesting. And for thee,
I, too, feel affection.

01:43.973 --> 01:46.541
All the best and good day,
madame.[knocking on door]

01:46.584 --> 01:50.371
MIKE:
I have a delivery
for Jake Davis.

01:50.414 --> 01:52.808
[laughing]: Oh-ho-ho.
Who might that be?

01:52.851 --> 01:55.593
It's your daddy!
Daddy!

01:55.637 --> 01:58.161
[both laughing]

01:58.205 --> 02:00.337
Oh, good to see you.

02:00.381 --> 02:01.686
Oh.
Oh, man.

02:01.730 --> 02:04.472
Oh, it's so good
to see you, Jake.

02:04.515 --> 02:05.908
It's good
to see you, too, man.

02:05.951 --> 02:07.083
You never come visit
out of the blue.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.215
What brings you out here?

02:08.258 --> 02:10.130
Well, I found out
I was dying.
What?

02:10.173 --> 02:12.697
To see you!

02:12.741 --> 02:13.916
I miss you.

02:13.959 --> 02:16.048
Plus, I'm curious
about this, uh,

02:16.092 --> 02:18.007
pop star roommate of yours.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.443
Oh, right.
Okay, well,

02:19.487 --> 02:21.358
just remember, Cooper likes
living a simple life,

02:21.402 --> 02:23.143
so it's best just
to act normal around him.

02:23.186 --> 02:26.581
Jake, I'm a lead accountant
with the Boston Celtics.

02:26.624 --> 02:28.452
I'm around celebrities
all the time.

02:28.496 --> 02:29.453
Hey, Mr. Davis.

Oh.

02:35.416 --> 02:36.721
I love your tunes.

02:36.765 --> 02:38.201
You're just awesome.

02:38.245 --> 02:40.072

04:08.291 --> 04:11.773
So I look up at the clock,
time is running out.

04:11.816 --> 04:14.645
The whole year has led
to this moment.

04:14.689 --> 04:18.040
And my team,
they're counting on me.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.128
It's April 15,

04:19.171 --> 04:20.347
tax day.

04:20.390 --> 04:22.740
Tax day.

04:22.784 --> 04:25.482
And I only have ten minutes

04:25.526 --> 04:27.832
to finish Paul Pierce's
tax return

04:27.876 --> 04:30.313
or I got to file the extension.JAKE: Ah.

04:30.357 --> 04:33.447
This is why you get
in the accounting gig.

04:33.490 --> 04:34.926
MIKE:
I got a receipt

04:34.970 --> 04:36.972
for a mango Jamba Juice
right next

04:37.015 --> 04:39.322
to a receipt
for a mango Ferrari.

04:40.976 --> 04:44.371
And that's when the roller ball
on my mouse gives out

04:44.414 --> 04:47.809
just like my fake tooth
when I bite into an apple.

04:47.852 --> 04:49.767
He's got a fake tooth,
when he bites into a...

04:49.811 --> 04:52.466
Yeah, I heard. That's the one
part I do understand.

04:52.509 --> 04:56.383
So now, I'm filing deductions
using the toggle column

04:56.426 --> 04:58.820
on the scroll bar,
and lowering

04:58.863 --> 05:01.475
the track piece like it's 1996.

05:01.518 --> 05:02.911
Oh!

05:04.608 --> 05:08.177
You got to tell me how it ends,
Cooper, I'm too nervous.

05:08.220 --> 05:12.660
And that, my friend,
is when my computer freezes.

05:12.703 --> 05:14.183
No!

05:14.226 --> 05:15.576
You were listening.

05:15.619 --> 05:17.360
I was listening.

05:17.404 --> 05:20.363
So I did the only thing I could,

05:20.407 --> 05:22.017
I hit the back button

05:22.060 --> 05:23.975
and re-entered
the tier one deductions

05:24.019 --> 05:25.542
from memory.

05:25.586 --> 05:28.502
Are you not entertained?!

05:32.070 --> 05:34.334
Judging from that reaction,

05:34.377 --> 05:36.379
that's a great story,
Mr. Davis.

05:36.423 --> 05:37.554
Oh, yeah, man.
Oh, yeah.

05:37.598 --> 05:39.251
Speaking of basketball,

05:39.295 --> 05:40.775
I'm singing the national anthem
at the Lakers game tomorrow

05:40.818 --> 05:42.211
if you guys want to come.

05:42.254 --> 05:44.213
Uh, that depends on who
they're playing.

05:44.256 --> 05:46.215
They're floor seats.That's my favorite team.

05:46.258 --> 05:47.782
[laughs]

05:47.825 --> 05:49.392
Thanks, Coop.

05:49.436 --> 05:51.438
Uh, I'll go get us
some more beers.
Yeah, sure.

05:51.481 --> 05:54.484
[laughs]

05:54.528 --> 05:56.660
So, Cooper,
what's with you living here?

05:56.704 --> 06:01.404
Is this like a reverse
Make-A-Wish kind of thing?

06:01.448 --> 06:03.537
Yeah, I know people
think it's weird,

06:03.580 --> 06:05.843
but I recently went
through a bad breakup,

06:05.887 --> 06:08.759
and wanted to escape the
public eye and hide for a while.

06:08.803 --> 06:12.589
Oh. I know what it's like
to want to hide.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.679
You just want to escape.

06:15.723 --> 06:18.987
Find a little cottage
out in the woods.

06:19.030 --> 06:22.730
Away from everyone
and everything.

06:22.773 --> 06:25.297
But then I'd be all alone
in my thoughts.

06:25.341 --> 06:27.299
Nothing but my harmonica.

06:29.258 --> 06:33.393
Which I really
can't even play.

06:40.617 --> 06:42.619
Mr. Davis, are...
are you okay?

06:42.663 --> 06:44.360
JAKE:
I got the beers.
[laughs]

06:44.404 --> 06:45.622
I got the beer.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.450
What are we talking about?Oh, nothing.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.409
Cooper's just sitting here
bumming me out.

06:54.370 --> 06:56.981
[sighs]
So it's Saturday night.

06:57.025 --> 07:01.333
Are you ready to forget that the
government is likely watching

07:01.377 --> 07:04.598
and get nasty?[Claire laughs]

07:04.641 --> 07:06.774
Yeah. [laughs]
I'm also kind of nervous

07:06.817 --> 07:08.602
'cause I've never
done this before.

07:08.645 --> 07:11.474
Me, either.
But how hard can it be?

07:11.518 --> 07:15.173
Which is a question I should
probably be asking you.

07:15.217 --> 07:17.524
[laughs]

07:21.049 --> 07:23.312
All right. Okay.

07:23.355 --> 07:25.749
[laughing]

07:25.793 --> 07:27.577
I'm sorry, that was so good.

07:27.621 --> 07:29.884
Okay. Ah, here we go.

07:29.927 --> 07:32.452
All right, here we go.
Here we go.Mm-hmm.

07:32.495 --> 07:34.715
[laughs] Hey, baby.

07:34.758 --> 07:36.891
Hey.[both laugh]

Mm-hmm.

07:43.550 --> 07:46.466

07:46.509 --> 07:48.555
Jake, is this working?

07:48.598 --> 07:50.165
I'm not sure.
So far, we just sound

07:50.208 --> 07:52.341
like Guy Fieri eating
a cheesesteak.

07:52.384 --> 07:54.474
You know what, I'm gonna Google
what we should say.

07:54.517 --> 07:55.736
That's smart.

07:55.779 --> 07:59.130
Let me just answer this e-mail
really fast.

07:59.174 --> 08:00.436
Babe, focus.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.742
What? Sorry. Okay.

08:01.785 --> 08:04.701
So, hey, boo.

08:04.745 --> 08:06.964
That's you. [laughs]

08:07.008 --> 08:10.620
Why don't you unbutton your
shirt and stroke your chest?

08:10.664 --> 08:14.755
Oh. Don't mind if I do-skees.

08:14.798 --> 08:16.060
[laughs]

08:16.104 --> 08:17.497
Ah.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.150
Now push 'em together.

08:19.194 --> 08:21.762
All right,
it's a little bit weird,

08:21.805 --> 08:23.459
but... how's that?

08:23.503 --> 08:25.417
Mm-hmm.Are they together enough?

08:25.461 --> 08:26.636
[both laugh]

08:26.680 --> 08:29.160
Now put a pencil between them.

08:30.379 --> 08:31.685
Uh...

08:35.863 --> 08:36.951
Now spit on it.

08:36.994 --> 08:38.474
Spit on it? What?

08:38.518 --> 08:40.607
Oh! Oh, no. I'm reading
what the guy should say.

08:40.650 --> 08:41.695
Okay, hold on.

08:42.391 --> 08:43.610
Ah! Someone's in here!

08:44.611 --> 08:46.438
Oh, there's my pencil.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.005
Always between the nipples,
am I right?

08:48.049 --> 08:49.572
Well, sorry to interrupt,

08:49.616 --> 08:51.487
but can I talk to you
about your dad?

08:51.531 --> 08:53.141
I'm a little worried he might
be going through something.

08:53.184 --> 08:55.665
What? Oh, come on, man,
that's crazy. [grunts]

08:55.709 --> 08:57.319
No offense, Cooper,
but if something was wrong,

08:57.362 --> 08:58.668
why would he talk to you
and not me?

08:58.712 --> 09:00.583
People open up to me
all the time.

09:00.627 --> 09:01.628
It might be because
of my single,

09:01.671 --> 09:02.890
"You Can Tell Me Anything--

09:02.933 --> 09:04.761
parentheses Yes, Anything."

09:06.633 --> 09:08.983
I'm just saying it might be
worth checking in with him.

09:09.026 --> 09:10.811
Oh, please. What would that
even sound like?

09:10.854 --> 09:12.943
[stupid voice]:
"Hey, Dad, are you okay?"

09:12.987 --> 09:14.815
[normal voice]:
He's okay.

09:14.858 --> 09:16.512
I don't know why
you'd use that voice,

09:16.556 --> 09:17.905
but, yeah, that's the gist.

09:17.948 --> 09:20.472
Anyway, I'll let you get back
to your FaceTime sex.

09:20.516 --> 09:22.170
I wasn't-- that's not what I was
doing. I wasn't doing that.

09:22.213 --> 09:23.563
Mate, I'd believe you,
but you're still connected

09:23.606 --> 09:25.129
to the Bluetooth speaker
downstairs.

09:29.830 --> 09:32.267
I'm a little nervous about
singing the national anthem.

09:32.310 --> 09:34.965
Do I say "spangled" weird?

09:35.009 --> 09:38.316
You say everything weird.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.537
Oh, uh...

09:42.669 --> 09:44.018
All right.

09:44.061 --> 09:45.672
Hey, uh, Pop.

09:45.715 --> 09:47.282
Um, how you doing?

09:47.325 --> 09:48.718
What's going on?
Everything good?

09:48.762 --> 09:50.154
Oh, everything's great.

09:50.198 --> 09:52.156
[laughs]

09:52.200 --> 09:53.636
Just rocking and rolling.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.855
Rocking and rolling.Yeah, yeah.

09:54.898 --> 09:56.291
Righteous. Righteous.Yeah, yeah.

09:56.334 --> 09:57.988
So everything's good at home?

09:58.032 --> 09:59.816
Oh, yeah.
Everything's great.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.035
So you're okay.

10:01.078 --> 10:02.558
Of course I'm okay.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.951
What kind of question is that?

10:03.994 --> 10:06.431
[stupid voice]:
Hey, Dad, are you okay?

10:07.824 --> 10:09.739
[stupid voice]:
Hey, Dad, are you okay?

10:10.784 --> 10:12.481
[phone rings]Oh, that is my phone.

10:12.524 --> 10:15.571
Must be Claire, my wife.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.749
I'm just gonna grab
one of these pencils

10:19.793 --> 10:21.751
for no reason whatsoever.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.753
[phone continues ringing]

10:28.497 --> 10:31.979
So, Cooper, how do you like
your eggs, buddy?

10:32.022 --> 10:33.720
Uh, over easy.

10:33.763 --> 10:37.767
Huh. I'll tell you
what was over easy.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.727
My marriage.

10:42.293 --> 10:43.817
I'm so sorry to hear that, Mike.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.819
Maybe we should tell Jake. Jake?

10:45.862 --> 10:47.559
It's been
six years

10:47.603 --> 10:49.387
since Jake's mom left me,

10:49.431 --> 10:53.957
and every day hurts
just a little bit more.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.655
Wow.

10:55.698 --> 10:57.657
Mike, could you just
give me one second?

10:57.700 --> 10:59.223
Jake?!

10:59.267 --> 11:00.572
Jake?

11:00.616 --> 11:02.662
Coop? Cooper?

11:06.361 --> 11:08.319
You know, I guess

11:08.363 --> 11:10.757
I thought somewhere,
in the back of my mind,

11:10.800 --> 11:13.107
that she would always
come back to me.

11:13.150 --> 11:15.675
Look, Mike, I wrote that
"You Can Tell Me Anything" song

11:15.718 --> 11:20.114
for the Trollsmovie, and
they didn't even use it, so...

11:20.157 --> 11:21.855
Well,
now she's getting remarried,

11:21.898 --> 11:24.118
so I guess
I just have to move on.

11:28.078 --> 11:30.994
You know what? I'm just
gonna go take a jog.

11:31.038 --> 11:35.607
[crying]:
Maybe the sweat will
camouflage my tears.

11:37.914 --> 11:40.351
Hey, where'd my dad go?Oh, he went for a run.

11:40.395 --> 11:42.745
Oh. Well, uh, that was my mom.

11:42.789 --> 11:45.574
Apparently,
she's getting remarried.

11:45.617 --> 11:48.708
Wonder if that's why
my dad's upset.

11:48.751 --> 11:50.710
[Mike wailing]

11:54.888 --> 11:56.933
Think it might be.

12:04.985 --> 12:07.074
Wow. So your mom's
getting remarried?

12:07.117 --> 12:09.859
Can't believe my dad hasn't
talked to me about this.

12:09.903 --> 12:11.426
You know, this whole time,
I thought

12:11.469 --> 12:13.558
I had this great relationship
with my dad, but...

12:13.602 --> 12:14.777
[sighs]

12:14.821 --> 12:16.779
Why won't he talk to me
about my mom?

12:16.823 --> 12:19.956
It's okay.
I mean, most dads don't talk

12:20.000 --> 12:21.958
to their sons
about their love lives.

12:22.002 --> 12:24.700
Yeah, but we're not just father
and son. We're best friends.

12:24.744 --> 12:27.007
And how many people can say
they started life

12:27.050 --> 12:28.356
in their best friend's scrotum?

12:28.399 --> 12:30.793
Okay.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.839
You know,
when we first started dating,

12:32.882 --> 12:34.841
you were pretty closed off
emotionally, too.

12:34.884 --> 12:37.626
And then, that one night,
we had a few drinks,

12:37.669 --> 12:39.759
and we played that game
"Never Have I Ever."

12:39.802 --> 12:42.239
We learned
that I was the first girl

12:42.283 --> 12:44.241
you ever said "I love you" to.

12:44.285 --> 12:46.809
And I felt way closer
to you after that night.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.811
Oh, honey, I was just trying
to get some.

12:48.855 --> 12:49.769
[Claire laughs]

12:49.812 --> 12:51.118
Well, it worked.

12:51.161 --> 12:53.903
Yeah. Yeah,
that's a great idea, babe.

12:53.947 --> 12:55.557
Yeah, I'll-I'll invite
your parents over

12:55.600 --> 12:58.821
for a little game night and try
to get my dad comfortable enough

12:58.865 --> 13:00.127
to open up to me.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.563
[laughs]
Mm-hmm.

13:01.606 --> 13:04.131
You know, we could start playing
right now,

13:04.174 --> 13:07.917
'cause never have I ever
had FaceTime sex.

13:07.961 --> 13:09.701
Ooh. [laughs]

13:09.745 --> 13:11.703
So, hey there, big boy.

13:11.747 --> 13:13.140
[static]

13:13.183 --> 13:14.750
So you like what you see?

13:14.794 --> 13:16.578
Screen froze.CLAIRE:
How is this?

13:16.621 --> 13:18.101
You look like you sell chins.

13:18.145 --> 13:20.843
Well, why don't you come up
to my hotel room, and...?

13:20.887 --> 13:22.932
Uh, rain check, okay?
Rain check....throw me down onto the bed?

13:25.717 --> 13:27.110
Is this turning you on?

13:27.154 --> 13:29.373
All right.

13:31.985 --> 13:34.552
[laughing]:
Oh. Mike, it has been
such a long time.

13:34.596 --> 13:36.250
Yeah, I haven't
seen you since

13:36.293 --> 13:39.775
you accidentally grabbed my butt
at the wedding.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.299
BOTH:
Sorry, I thought
you were someone else.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.608
[knocking at door]

13:49.132 --> 13:50.873
Hey, g'day.Hey there, Cooper.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.310
Hey.Check out our courtside
tickets for tomorrow's game.

13:53.354 --> 13:54.921
I am very excited!

13:54.964 --> 13:56.923
So sorry. This is for
me, Jake and his dad.

13:56.966 --> 13:58.968
For you guys!

13:59.012 --> 14:00.796
Don't worry.
This isn't the first time

14:00.840 --> 14:04.321
I've been excluded
from a threesome.

14:04.365 --> 14:06.193
Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.

14:06.236 --> 14:07.585
Guys, you know
my manager Wayne.

14:07.629 --> 14:08.717
Hey.
Hi, Wayne.
Hey.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.545
Hey, buddy. Have a seat.

14:10.588 --> 14:12.634
So, tonight, I was thinking
we all play a little

14:12.677 --> 14:14.157
"get to know each other"
kind of game.

14:14.201 --> 14:16.507
Oh, great. I'll find a bowl
for us to put our keys in.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.861
Uh, no, no. I was,
uh, thinking more like

14:21.904 --> 14:23.384
"Never Have I Ever." Right?

14:23.427 --> 14:25.429
So, you say something
that you've never done,

14:25.473 --> 14:27.214
and if someone has
done it, they drink.

14:27.257 --> 14:32.741
Ooh, well, I have
never played this game.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.917
Uh, Bonnie, no. You-you drink
if you havedone it.

14:34.961 --> 14:39.269
Oh, well, now I have.
[laughs]

14:39.313 --> 14:41.402
Well, I'll go first.
Uh... hmm.

14:41.445 --> 14:42.882
At the top of my head.

14:42.925 --> 14:45.754
I don't know.
Uh, never have I ever...

14:45.797 --> 14:48.888
hidden my feelings
from my best friend.

14:55.372 --> 14:57.070
All right,
that was a lame one. I'll go.

14:57.113 --> 15:00.160
Never have I ever...
had sex at work.

15:00.203 --> 15:01.857
Oh. [scoffs]

15:04.425 --> 15:07.210
[laughter]
Hey-oh!
Hey-oh!

15:11.606 --> 15:16.002
Uh, Gerald, we've worked
together our entire careers.

15:16.045 --> 15:18.395
Oh, honey, this was before we
met, when I worked at the zoo.

15:18.439 --> 15:20.702
Oh...

15:23.009 --> 15:25.925
Oh.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.622
Oh, I got another one.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.972
Uh, never have I ever
buried my feelings

15:30.016 --> 15:32.192
because I felt like I had
to be strong for everyone else.

15:39.939 --> 15:43.203
Jake, did I leave my journal
lying around the office?

15:43.246 --> 15:44.987
[laughing]:
'Cause...

15:45.031 --> 15:46.380
All right, Dad, you're up.

15:46.423 --> 15:48.948
It can be anything,
anything you're feeling at all.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.950
Okay, uh...

15:50.993 --> 15:53.648
never have I ever...

15:53.691 --> 15:56.346
tried gazpacho.

15:56.390 --> 15:59.045
Ooh.

15:59.088 --> 16:01.917
Tried gazpacho?
Yeah.

16:03.179 --> 16:06.139
Is that all you got?

16:08.663 --> 16:11.057
Ah. I love a cold soup.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.016
It's so surprising.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.887
It's like stepping
onto an escalator that's broken.

16:15.931 --> 16:17.454
Oh...

16:17.498 --> 16:19.500
Hey, I got one. I got one.

16:19.543 --> 16:21.893
Never have I ever found out

16:21.937 --> 16:23.765
that my ex-wife
is getting remarried,

16:23.808 --> 16:25.245
which made the
reality of my divorce

16:25.288 --> 16:27.769
hit home in a way
it hadn't in six years,

16:27.812 --> 16:29.858
and I'd rather talk
to a stranger about it

16:29.901 --> 16:31.033
than my own son!

16:32.861 --> 16:34.776
Boy, you read me like a book.

16:37.735 --> 16:39.215
What the hell, Jake?

16:39.259 --> 16:41.478
This was supposed
to be a fun game.

16:41.522 --> 16:43.959
Yeah, well, it would be fun
if you would just open up to me.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.701
Look, I know you're upset
about Mom getting remarried.

16:46.744 --> 16:50.096
Well, that's my problem, and
it's up to me to deal with it.

16:50.139 --> 16:52.489
But I want to help you.
We're best friends.

16:52.533 --> 16:55.188
Yeah, well, best friends
don't trick each other

16:55.231 --> 16:58.017
into talking about things
that they don't want to.

16:58.060 --> 17:01.063
Damn. To think that's how
you repay the guy

17:01.107 --> 17:03.283
who carried you around
in his scrotum.

17:10.681 --> 17:13.902
[indistinct shouting]

17:13.945 --> 17:15.034
[cheering]

17:17.210 --> 17:18.689
Right.

17:18.733 --> 17:21.170
Pretty good seats, huh?

17:21.214 --> 17:23.129
Little tip. Uh, when
the cheerleaders come out,

17:23.172 --> 17:24.521
make sure you stare
at the ceiling.

17:24.565 --> 17:26.001
Otherwise, the tabloids
will make it look

17:26.045 --> 17:28.743
like you're staring
at their butts.

17:28.786 --> 17:29.961
[organ plays cheer]

17:30.005 --> 17:32.051
Well, this is fun.

17:32.094 --> 17:34.705
You know, Justin Timberlake
and Kevin Hart wanted

17:34.749 --> 17:37.491
to come tonight, but I'm super
glad I brought you guys instead.

17:37.534 --> 17:40.146
[organ plays cheer]

17:40.189 --> 17:42.539
He's right, Dad.
You know, um,

17:42.583 --> 17:44.106
this is your last night here,

17:44.150 --> 17:47.066
and these seats
are insane, so...

17:47.109 --> 17:49.764
can we just go back to only
talking about sports and stuff?

17:49.807 --> 17:51.722
Yeah.
[cheering]

17:51.766 --> 17:53.550
ANNOUNCER:
LeBron James, for three!

17:53.594 --> 17:55.596
[cheering, whooping]

17:59.208 --> 18:01.993
I can't believe
LeBron left Cleveland.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.691
Right? Must have
been devastating

18:03.734 --> 18:07.173
for those Cleveland fans,
getting left behind like that.

18:09.218 --> 18:11.177
Oh, totally.

18:11.220 --> 18:13.222
Yeah. Uh,

18:13.266 --> 18:16.225
you know, it's-it's got
to be painful as hell

18:16.269 --> 18:17.661
when someone
you thought would be

18:17.705 --> 18:19.750
on your team forever
leaves for another team.

18:19.794 --> 18:22.753
But, uh, doesn't mean
that the Cavs should just

18:22.797 --> 18:24.320
shut down and stop playing.

18:24.364 --> 18:26.148
They got to get
back out there,

18:26.192 --> 18:28.237
maybe even find a new LeMom...
I mean, LeBron.

18:28.281 --> 18:31.110
[organ plays cheer]

18:31.153 --> 18:34.025
I'm just scared
that Cleveland

18:34.069 --> 18:37.464
will never be the
same without LeBron.

18:37.507 --> 18:39.248
Dad, come on.
That's impossible.

18:39.292 --> 18:40.684
Cleveland needs
to look back

18:40.728 --> 18:42.904
on all the times
it had with LeBron fondly.

18:42.947 --> 18:45.472
Remember that
they'll always have

18:45.515 --> 18:48.170
that sexy championship
they made together.

18:48.214 --> 18:51.652
I'll always love
that championship.

18:51.695 --> 18:54.785
Well, Dad, all the championship
wants is for Cleveland

18:54.829 --> 18:56.787
to open up to it
from time to time.

18:56.831 --> 19:00.139
It's just, I know how much
you look up to me, Jake,

19:00.182 --> 19:04.273
and I'm afraid that if I
burden you with my problems,

19:04.317 --> 19:06.449
you might start
thinking less of me.

19:06.493 --> 19:08.973
Dad, you've been my hero
since I was a little kid.

19:09.017 --> 19:12.499
You're the coolest dad ever, and
you've always been there for me.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.718
And nothing would
make me happier

19:14.762 --> 19:17.286
than to have the chance
to repay the favor.

19:17.330 --> 19:18.896
Oh, man.

19:18.940 --> 19:20.202
[voice breaking]:
Dad, don't do that.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.204
Yo... and...

19:22.248 --> 19:24.424
No, 'cause when your lip
quivers, my lip quivers.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.208
I know, and it's
just, I love you, man.

19:26.252 --> 19:28.167
When you cry,
then I feel like...

19:28.210 --> 19:30.212
I love you so much, Dad.[horn blows]

19:30.256 --> 19:32.214
ANNOUNCER:
The Los Angeles Lakers would
like to once again thank

19:32.258 --> 19:36.218
multi-platinum recording artist,
Cooper James,

19:36.262 --> 19:38.699
for singing today's
National Anthem.

19:38.742 --> 19:41.528
[both crying,
phone ringing]

19:41.571 --> 19:44.357
That was good. Oh.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.010
Oh. Oh, babe.

19:46.054 --> 19:49.013
You'll never guess
what just happened. Claire?

19:49.057 --> 19:52.147
Hey, babe. I hope that
you're ready for some cybersex.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.105
ALL THREE:
No! No!

19:54.149 --> 19:56.151
No!

Jake, what the hell?!

19:58.371 --> 20:00.155
I'm sorry, baby.
I forgot to tell you

20:00.199 --> 20:01.635
I was at a basketball game
tonight.

20:01.678 --> 20:03.463
I'll call you later, okay?
I'm super impressed.

20:03.506 --> 20:05.508
So was everyone else. Bye.

20:12.950 --> 20:15.388
[Jake and Claire moaning]

20:16.911 --> 20:19.609
I can't believe we're finally
doing this on FaceTime.

20:19.653 --> 20:21.916
CLAIRE:
I know. I've been so hungry
for it.

20:21.959 --> 20:23.526
[Jake laughs]

20:23.570 --> 20:25.354
[both moan]

20:25.398 --> 20:27.965
BOTH:
Mmm!

20:28.009 --> 20:29.184
Ah.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.230
Such a good call
to just bail on the sex

20:31.273 --> 20:33.797
and just skip to the part where
we eat the ice cream together.

20:33.841 --> 20:37.366
Yeah, and for once, we can both
finish at the same time.

20:37.410 --> 20:38.976
[both laugh]

20:39.020 --> 20:40.108
Mmm.CLAIRE:
Oh.

20:40.151 --> 20:41.501
Ah, don't tease me.

20:41.544 --> 20:43.720
[Jake and Claire moaning]

20:46.680 --> 20:48.116
[both moaning]

20:48.159 --> 20:50.597
JAKE:
Look how thick
that piece of chocolate is.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.381
CLAIRE:
Mmm. Oh.

20:52.425 --> 20:54.078
JAKE:
Thick.

20:54.122 --> 20:55.993
CLAIRE:
Ah, it's going straight
to my butt, but I don't care.

20:56.037 --> 21:00.128
For God's sake, Jake, get
your damn phone off Bluetooth!
