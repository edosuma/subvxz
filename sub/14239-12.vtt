I thought you'd done this for me.

00:52.980 --> 00:56.265
88 is a joyous year
for the Japanese.

00:56.300 --> 00:58.540
I'm off to London
to watch men throw rice.

00:58.575 --> 01:01.677
You get that in the Balti

01:01.712 --> 01:04.780
OK, down to business.
What have we got?

01:04.815 --> 01:06.545
The Ritz Dancehall.

01:06.580 --> 01:11.780
It's been derelict since 1989 but
someone's complained about hearing music...

01:11.815 --> 01:13.980
music from the 1940s.

01:14.015 --> 01:15.460

01:34.980 --> 01:39.105
Just dashing young soldiers
and pretty young ladies.

01:39.140 --> 01:44.380
And as they danced, the girls would look into
their partners' eyes, smile softly and say...

01:44.415 --> 01:46.265
Jack! Mind my laptop.

01:46.300 --> 01:50.700

"How long before you head off to war?"

Tosh's rift monitor programme.

03:40.140 --> 03:44.060
She set it to alert me if there
were any further movements.

03:44.095 --> 03:49.065
The rift's been opening
more and more recently.

03:49.100 --> 03:52.660
Yeah, well, I've noticed that.
Doesn't take a genius.

03:52.695 --> 03:56.220
Tosh reckons the equations
are forming a pattern.

03:56.255 --> 03:58.105
I should call her.

03:58.140 --> 04:01.620
She may have readings her end
and this is over my head.

04:01.655 --> 04:04.397
Um, why wasn't I told about this?

04:04.432 --> 04:07.140
Well, you've been off, haven't you?

04:10.220 --> 04:11.980
The line's dead.

04:13.060 --> 04:16.420
It's no use. It's dead.
I can't get through to the Hub.

04:16.454 --> 04:17.904
Let's get back inside.

04:17.940 --> 04:19.860
That's where we were
when we crossed.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.420
'Gwen, can you get down
to Sage Street?'

04:24.455 --> 04:27.025
Yep. What's up? 'We need Tosh. '

04:27.060 --> 04:31.540
The rift monitor sounded. She's with Jack but
their phones are dead and we can't access her files.

04:31.575 --> 04:33.060
'OK, I'll get down there now'.

04:34.100 --> 04:36.700
We really are in 1941.

04:37.740 --> 04:40.025
What if we can't get back?

04:40.060 --> 04:45.860
Flotsam and jetsam slips through all the
time. We'll get back. Look on the bright side.

04:45.895 --> 04:50.157
Gives you one hell of an excuse for
your party. I have a life there.

04:50.192 --> 04:54.420
And they can't help us because
I have the latest readings in here.

04:54.455 --> 04:57.057
People are staring at us.

04:57.092 --> 04:59.456
We need to try to blend in.

04:59.491 --> 05:01.785
It's easy for you to say.

05:01.820 --> 05:06.660
I'm the only Asian here. Don't worry.
You're with the Captain.

05:07.780 --> 05:12.580
Hey. I've got into Tosh's files,
all her reports.

05:12.615 --> 05:15.185
See there, December 24th.

05:15.220 --> 05:18.020
That's when Diane
flew through the rift.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.025
I had to let her go.

05:23.060 --> 05:25.300
You were in love with her,
weren't you?

05:26.980 --> 05:30.140
If Tosh knows a way
of opening the rift,

05:30.175 --> 05:31.865
maybe we can get Diane back.

05:31.900 --> 05:36.140
Jack would never allow it. Opening
the rift could devastate the city.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.180
# My love is true

05:40.215 --> 05:41.945
# And just for you

# I would do most anything
at any time... #

05:49.820 --> 05:53.860
Water, please, and a brandy.
I haven't seen you in here before.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.620
Three and six, please, sir.

05:58.820 --> 06:00.460
I'll, er...

06:00.495 --> 06:02.100
get them.

06:03.260 --> 06:07.140
Thank you. On one condition. What?

06:12.260 --> 06:18.540

06:19.820 --> 06:22.820

06:30.340 --> 06:31.980

06:34.660 --> 06:37.220
They must be here somewhere.

Do you mind?

07:15.020 --> 07:20.260
I'm only borrowing her, mate. Maybe she doesn't want
to be borrowed. You want to make something of it?

07:20.295 --> 07:21.860
You can always dance with me.

07:24.580 --> 07:27.060
OK, I'll lead. You follow.

Cut it out, kiddo.

07:39.420 --> 07:41.265
Sorry about that.

07:41.300 --> 07:45.540
The men are a bit lively tonight.
It's last day of OTU tomorrow.

07:45.575 --> 07:49.177
Apologise to the gentleman, George.
I was only dancing.

07:49.212 --> 07:52.780
I think it was your fist
he didn't like, not your foxtrot.

07:54.820 --> 07:58.540
I'm sorry.
It's OK. You barely got me.

08:01.420 --> 08:04.180
I think the lady also deserves
an apology.

08:04.215 --> 08:05.785
I'm sorry.

08:05.820 --> 08:08.985
Apology accepted.

08:09.020 --> 08:11.460
Let's get a drink, George.

Hey, are you a volunteer too? Yeah.

08:15.395 --> 08:18.345
I'm Captain...

08:18.380 --> 08:22.060
You go first. I'm Captain
Jack Harkness. 133rd Squadron.

08:23.860 --> 08:26.060
Look this way, please.

08:29.740 --> 08:34.419
Right, the Ritz Dancehall,
opened in 1932, shut down in 1989.

08:34.455 --> 08:37.265
Due to be demolished in one week.

08:37.299 --> 08:40.345
Now, the reported music
is from the 1940s.

08:40.380 --> 08:44.940
Why is a ghost job taking them this
long? All those young soldiers...

08:47.380 --> 08:49.900
Owen, look.

08:49.935 --> 08:51.940
There.

08:57.620 --> 09:00.300
One more for the record, sir.

09:00.335 --> 09:02.060
I insist.

09:04.700 --> 09:06.340
Thank you, gentlemen.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.980
I should be heading off..
Hey, I didn't catch your names.

09:11.015 --> 09:12.785
Toshiko Sato.

09:12.820 --> 09:16.145
I'm Captain James Harper. 71st.

09:16.180 --> 09:19.820
71st, that's where I'm hoping
to be posted. What's your poison?

09:19.855 --> 09:23.460
Maybe later. My friend and I were
in the middle of something. Sure.

09:28.580 --> 09:30.740
Why does that man have your name?

09:32.580 --> 09:35.340
I'm lost enough here
without you holding back on me!

09:38.340 --> 09:40.740
It's not my name.

09:40.775 --> 09:42.397
It's his.

09:42.432 --> 09:43.985
I took his.

09:44.020 --> 09:47.660
But I didn't realise he was...
so hot!

09:47.695 --> 09:49.225
Jack!

09:49.260 --> 09:51.800
I know too much.

09:51.835 --> 09:54.305
Then... share.

09:54.340 --> 09:56.900
You wouldn't want that. Trust me.

09:58.740 --> 10:00.540
We have to get back.

10:00.575 --> 10:02.425
What's in here?

10:02.460 --> 10:06.940
I've got half the equation in here.
The other half's back at the Hub.

10:06.975 --> 10:10.025
If I can find some way of getting
these figures back to base,

10:10.060 --> 10:14.300
they can combine them, open the rift
and bring us back through. Come on.

10:16.380 --> 10:18.505
I heard music earlier.

10:18.540 --> 10:22.940
If I can hear them,
maybe they can hear me.

10:22.975 --> 10:25.757
They've got to come back.

10:37.820 --> 10:39.905
What?

10:39.940 --> 10:41.620
I thought I heard my name.

10:43.980 --> 10:49.180
OK, so we use Tosh's information
to open the rift

10:49.215 --> 10:51.140
and bring them back.

10:51.175 --> 10:52.665
We can't.

10:52.700 --> 10:54.265
Half the equation's missing.

10:54.300 --> 10:57.900
It can't be. It must be somewhere
else. Let me try. It's not there.

10:57.935 --> 11:01.500
It might be in her laptop. Which
she never goes anywhere without.

11:01.535 --> 11:03.780
Shit. Shit!

11:06.700 --> 11:09.180
No-one here. Come on, quick.

11:15.180 --> 11:19.260
It works! LAPTOP: 'Your battery
is running low'.

11:19.295 --> 11:22.020
Just take down everything,
in case it dies.

11:26.260 --> 11:30.900
I'm not used to writing with these
things! Don't press so hard.

11:32.460 --> 11:35.620
Oh, no. LAPTOP: 'Your battery
is low. ' Can you read that?

11:37.180 --> 11:39.905
Plus one over five a...

11:39.940 --> 11:43.705
sine two eight X.
'Your battery... '

11:43.740 --> 11:47.580
You got everything you need? I just
need the coordinates of the hall,

11:47.615 --> 11:49.825
so I can integrate them
into the equation.

11:49.860 --> 11:52.380
Then we need to get the information
back to the Hub.

11:52.415 --> 11:54.140
What are you doing in here?

11:55.380 --> 11:58.185
Who are you?

11:58.220 --> 12:01.145
Captain... James Harper.

12:01.180 --> 12:06.100
And this is Toshiko Sato,
friend and mathematician.

12:06.135 --> 12:09.265
I'm Bilis, the manager.

12:09.300 --> 12:14.580
You're not in full uniform, Captain.
On leave.

12:14.615 --> 12:16.300
48 hours.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.105
That's an interesting camera.

12:21.140 --> 12:25.420
It takes photographs instantly. I
didn't know they could do that yet.

12:25.455 --> 12:30.620

They're coming for us now.

13:07.980 --> 13:13.380
Hello. Could you open it all up for me? I think
some of my friends got locked in. Follow me.

13:13.415 --> 13:15.060
Thank you.

13:16.140 --> 13:19.220
Pearl Harbour, Jack. Doesn't happen
till the end of the year.

13:19.255 --> 13:23.780
Granddad stayed in London
but he was persecuted.

13:23.815 --> 13:25.700
If I stay here,
what will happen?

13:27.260 --> 13:28.580
I'll take care of you.

13:30.460 --> 13:34.700
This period,
you look like you fit in.

13:34.735 --> 13:37.380
Have you been here before?

13:37.415 --> 13:39.265
Yeah.

13:39.300 --> 13:43.700
I can't explain
but I served in the war in 1941.

13:43.735 --> 13:46.705
I was undercover.

13:46.740 --> 13:52.260
I needed a false identity,
so I took... his name.

13:52.295 --> 13:54.660
Who were you
before you took his name?

13:58.340 --> 14:01.060
Why him? It was convenient.

14:02.140 --> 14:05.620
But if you chose his identity
to steal, then he...?

14:05.655 --> 14:07.460
Dies, in battle.

14:07.495 --> 14:08.820
When?

14:10.380 --> 14:11.860
Tomorrow.

14:13.580 --> 14:18.060
And I say, "Look, love, it's raining
bombs and fire, so get down that cellar. "

14:18.095 --> 14:22.260
And she says, "I can't,
there's rats down there!"

14:22.295 --> 14:25.505
So, who's the best navigator here?

14:25.540 --> 14:30.140
Tim. He can't fly for toffee, but at least when
he goes down, he'll know exactly where he is.

14:31.700 --> 14:34.460
Why don't we chat over here?

14:34.495 --> 14:37.500
HE WOLF-WHISTLES

14:39.540 --> 14:42.320
I give the public schoolboy
a fortnight.

14:42.355 --> 14:45.065
That boy's come a long way
in five weeks.

14:45.100 --> 14:48.740
As long as you boys remember
your training, you'll be all right.

14:48.775 --> 14:51.140
Glad you came. Shall we sit down?

15:04.460 --> 15:09.300
Why were your friends in here,
anyway? Just a silly dare.

15:09.335 --> 15:10.940
Someone said it was haunted.

15:10.975 --> 15:13.225
You look worried, dear.

15:13.260 --> 15:16.500
I'll make you a nice cup of tea.

15:20.700 --> 15:26.540
The sun rose this morning at 08.12,

15:26.575 --> 15:28.545
21 by 7 degrees.

15:28.580 --> 15:31.100
I note it down every day.

15:31.135 --> 15:33.620
It's a bit silly, I suppose.

15:33.655 --> 15:36.265
It's fantastic.

15:36.300 --> 15:39.145
You must have seen some action.

15:39.180 --> 15:42.040
Let's just say the enemy comes
in many guises.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.865
Yeah, I can't wait
to give Jerry what for.

15:44.900 --> 15:48.980
How many did you kill in the Battle
of Britain, sir? 26, wasn't it?

15:49.015 --> 15:51.305
You've read that story
countless times.

15:51.340 --> 15:53.900
No-one's as fast as him.
Hasn't lost a man yet.

15:55.860 --> 15:59.620
Care for a drink, Captain?
I'll just have water, thanks.

15:59.655 --> 16:01.100
All right.

16:04.100 --> 16:08.180
Hello, Jack. I know you're having
a night with the men

16:08.215 --> 16:11.740
but I thought I'd look in,
if that's all right.

16:11.775 --> 16:13.745
Yeah.

16:13.780 --> 16:15.500
Good to see you.

16:24.100 --> 16:28.260
Is anyone expecting you?

16:28.295 --> 16:29.465
Yes.

16:29.500 --> 16:34.100
Perhaps you should call them, otherwise
they may think you've disappeared too.

16:34.135 --> 16:36.620
I'll put the kettle on.

16:36.655 --> 16:40.260
CLOCK CHIMES

16:42.380 --> 16:43.945
Anything your end?

16:43.980 --> 16:48.220
There are no more photographs
of Jack and Tosh after that night.

16:48.255 --> 16:51.060
That's encouraging.
Yeah, unless the bombs got 'em.

16:51.095 --> 16:54.017
The manager, Bilis Manger,

16:54.052 --> 16:56.940
kept them for posterity.

16:56.975 --> 16:59.025
Bilis Manger?

16:59.060 --> 17:00.825
That's the name of the caretaker.

17:00.860 --> 17:03.585
Can't be the same guy, can it?
Not old enough.

17:03.620 --> 17:07.420
But he does look a bit
out of his time. He wears a cravat.

17:13.060 --> 17:15.819
Gwen, he's in the photo
with Jack and Tosh.

17:18.940 --> 17:22.425
He's the answer. He came through
the rift. Find out what he's doing.

17:22.460 --> 17:27.020
No. Get out, Gwen. Wait for backup. We can't
lose him. Nor Gwen! Maybe this is a trap.

17:27.055 --> 17:30.705
He could be sucking us
back through time one by one.

17:30.740 --> 17:34.460
Get out of there, Gwen. I'm sorry
but who put you in charge?

17:42.300 --> 17:45.105
I've got what I need.
Now all I have to do

17:45.140 --> 17:50.020
is find a way to leave a message for the team
on something that will last across time. OK.

17:51.940 --> 17:54.300
I haven't seen you two here before.

17:54.335 --> 17:56.625
Is she with you?
Nah, she's after Tim.

17:56.660 --> 18:00.185
Why else would she let him
bore her to death about navigation?

18:00.220 --> 18:04.660
Maybe she's a spy. The Chinese are on
our side, aren't they? I'm Japanese.

18:04.695 --> 18:07.825
You're hardly an ally, then.
Leave it, Audrey.

18:07.860 --> 18:10.920
So whose side are you on?
What's in the bag? Nothing.

18:10.955 --> 18:14.627
If you've got nothing to hide,
open the bag! She can't.

18:14.662 --> 18:18.265
Her work is top secret.
She's a decoder for the Brits.

18:18.300 --> 18:22.420
Without her, we'd have no way of
defending the country. To Toshiko.

18:22.455 --> 18:24.500
Toshiko!

18:25.820 --> 18:29.585
I need Bilis's camera.
Photographs last, don't they?

18:29.620 --> 18:35.060
Sure you don't want me to come with you? Oh, you
can't run out on me. I've just got you a drink.

18:35.095 --> 18:37.620
I'm fine. You carry on.

18:39.140 --> 18:40.700
To a fellow captain.

18:42.340 --> 18:45.345
So, what brings you down here?
I had to rest up.

18:45.380 --> 18:50.020
Injured my back bailing over Kent.
That's his excuse for not dancing.

18:50.055 --> 18:52.420
Mind if I join you?

18:52.455 --> 18:53.860
Sure. Why not?

19:03.900 --> 19:05.625
Starting to be a habit.

19:05.660 --> 19:08.585
I just wanted to try it out.

19:08.620 --> 19:14.180
This little beauty is very unusual
and rare, not unlike yourself.

19:16.260 --> 19:18.100
Don't go without this.

19:20.980 --> 19:25.580
I could think of better things
to photograph than numbers, my dear.

19:29.780 --> 19:31.220
Do call again.

19:39.780 --> 19:42.100
What are you doing?

19:42.135 --> 19:43.985
Owen!

19:44.020 --> 19:48.580
We haven't got the missing numbers. We'll
improvise with the Rift Manipulator. We can't.

19:48.615 --> 19:50.705
It's risky enough with the equation.

19:50.740 --> 19:54.380
If we don't do it properly, anything
can happen. Bombs are falling.

19:54.415 --> 19:56.980
They're stuck in the middle
of the Cardiff Blitz.

19:57.015 --> 19:58.620
It's our duty to get 'em out.

20:08.300 --> 20:12.060
JACK'S LAUGHTER ECHOES
Jack?

20:22.740 --> 20:26.460
Open the rift and the world could
suffer. We could all get sucked in.

20:26.495 --> 20:29.105
Who knows what will come out?

20:29.140 --> 20:32.460
This is about Diane! When will you
accept she chose to leave you?

20:33.820 --> 20:40.300
Whereas your cyber-girlfriend stuck around.
Not that she had a choice, wired in the cellar.

20:40.335 --> 20:44.420
That was different. Yeah. Mainly
because Diane didn't try and kill us

20:44.455 --> 20:47.425
and she also happened
to be a human being. Stop it.

20:47.460 --> 20:51.980
Not some monster. I thought
she was still Lisa. I loved her.

20:53.060 --> 20:56.820
You only knew Diane for a week.
And it wasn't enough.

20:56.855 --> 21:00.580
Maybe the Manipulator
can calculate the missing figures.

21:13.380 --> 21:16.265
It isn't working. Good.

21:16.300 --> 21:19.460
Jack would never have wanted us
to use it this way.

21:19.495 --> 21:22.180
There's a piece missing.

21:23.180 --> 21:25.100
We've got to find it.

21:28.420 --> 21:32.820
Maybe you should go home.
You don't have any power over me.

21:37.220 --> 21:42.340
OK, lanto, we'll play it your way -
safe and boring.

21:44.380 --> 21:47.180
BUG BAND TUNE FINISHES

21:47.215 --> 21:50.340
PEOPLE APPLAUD

21:52.900 --> 21:56.745
So, what's your next mission?
Careless talk costs lives.

21:56.780 --> 22:00.020
I should go anyway. No, I didn't
mean that to... It's all right.

22:00.055 --> 22:01.940
I can get a lift if I leave now.

22:03.740 --> 22:05.700
I'd better stay here.

22:06.860 --> 22:08.980
Aren't you leaving tomorrow night?

22:10.940 --> 22:13.785
You sick of us Welsh already?

22:13.820 --> 22:17.220
Yeah, that's why I'm still
fighting for you.

22:20.620 --> 22:22.940
I'll be in touch
when I'm next on leave.

22:28.140 --> 22:30.745
Nancy...

22:30.780 --> 22:33.620
it's been a good few weeks.

22:45.020 --> 22:46.500
Was that it?

22:48.740 --> 22:53.780
She's a sweet kid, but I need to look after
my men tonight. It's their last day tomorrow.

22:53.815 --> 22:55.937
Go after her.

22:55.972 --> 22:58.025
Kiss her goodbye.

22:58.060 --> 23:00.585
Anything can happen tomorrow.

23:00.620 --> 23:04.180
It's just a routine training
exercise. I'm hardly gonna die.

23:04.215 --> 23:08.180
That's when they catch you,
when you least expect it.

23:08.215 --> 23:09.820
You don't know what's ahead.

23:11.380 --> 23:15.100
Kiss her... goodbye.

23:22.860 --> 23:23.900
Nancy?

23:44.060 --> 23:46.380
I love you.

24:03.220 --> 24:06.600
That just made things
20 times worse.

24:06.635 --> 24:09.945
Now she thinks
she's in love with me.

24:09.980 --> 24:12.705
Hey, her falling for you
is hardly my fault.

24:12.740 --> 24:16.340
Play it coo in front of your men,
but not me. It's OK to be scared.

24:16.375 --> 24:18.625
A captain has to keep his head.

24:18.660 --> 24:22.020
A captain needs to explain risks,
tell his men what to expect.

24:22.055 --> 24:24.305
So what do I do?

24:24.340 --> 24:27.500
Tell 'em I saw a young boy
get shot in the eyes mid-flight?

24:27.535 --> 24:28.785
I understand.

24:28.820 --> 24:32.380
Do you? Did you hear him on the
radio, yelling for his mom,

24:32.415 --> 24:35.940
while the Messerschmitts shot him
blew his plane apart?

24:35.975 --> 24:38.585
All I can hear on the radio...
Is screams.

24:38.620 --> 24:42.385
I went to war when I was a boy.
I was with my best friend.

24:42.420 --> 24:47.980
We got caught crossing the border over enemy
lines. They tortured him because he was weaker.

24:48.015 --> 24:53.780
They made me watch him die.
And they let me go.

24:53.815 --> 24:55.065
Who were they?

24:55.100 --> 24:58.340
The worst possible creatures
you can imagine.

24:59.940 --> 25:01.505
I persuaded him to join up.

25:01.540 --> 25:03.820
I said it would be an adventure.

25:03.855 --> 25:06.097
He hadn't lived.

25:06.132 --> 25:08.340
Have any of us?

25:39.420 --> 25:44.220
OK, team...
I hope you like treasure hunts.

25:45.980 --> 25:48.500
No sign of Bilis leaving the area.

25:52.820 --> 25:56.340
Er, where are you off to?
The dancehall.

25:56.375 --> 25:57.905
Bilis's office.

25:57.940 --> 26:01.700
He must know how the rift works.
Maybe we'll find a clue there.

26:10.900 --> 26:15.380
What would Jack and Tosh do?
How would they try and help us?

26:19.260 --> 26:20.700
Bilis!

26:42.780 --> 26:44.220
I need more equations, Gwen.

26:47.060 --> 26:49.340
What happened here, Tosh?

26:51.620 --> 26:53.780
No.

27:03.940 --> 27:06.380
AIR RAID SIREN WAILS

27:19.860 --> 27:22.260
BOMB WHISTLES THROUGH AIR

27:23.380 --> 27:25.900
THEY SCREAM

27:29.060 --> 27:30.065
Toshiko!

27:30.100 --> 27:32.540
Toshiko! Jack!

27:32.575 --> 27:35.065
This way!

27:35.100 --> 27:39.460
I didn't get the first part
in the photo. The rest is outside.

27:39.495 --> 27:42.740
If they find it, they'll
keep looking, won't they? Yeah.

27:44.180 --> 27:47.860
'Be careful, Gwen.
Bilis is still around'.

27:49.420 --> 27:52.160
Owen, where are you? 'I'm in the
building. Where's Bilis's office?'

27:52.195 --> 27:54.900
It's at the far end of the corridor.
I'll keep looking out here.

28:30.780 --> 28:32.225
Yes!

28:32.260 --> 28:35.180
BOMBS BOOM OVERHEAD

28:38.140 --> 28:42.460
Thing is, you could be
the last girl I ever kiss.

28:49.900 --> 28:51.625
I've got to finish the message.

28:51.660 --> 28:54.580
Pencil will fade.
I need to find something else.

29:15.060 --> 29:17.380
Airtight. This'll do.

29:48.500 --> 29:55.280
# There'll be bluebirds over

29:55.315 --> 30:02.060
# The white cliffs of Dover

30:02.095 --> 30:05.905
# Tomorrow

30:05.940 --> 30:10.060
# Just you wait and see... #

30:13.220 --> 30:15.460
OK.

30:26.140 --> 30:27.620
Shit!

30:29.420 --> 30:31.900
CLOCK CHIMES

30:34.940 --> 30:37.940
ALARM CLOCK BEEPS

30:39.060 --> 30:41.380
Timepieces.

31:05.740 --> 31:11.300
I didn't find any equations.
Um, I'll get back to the Hub.

31:11.335 --> 31:14.940
I'll keep looking here, then.
Yeah, you do that.

31:23.180 --> 31:24.660
Yes.

31:26.940 --> 31:29.340
Of course I'm scared.

31:50.140 --> 31:54.500
I'm going to check everywhere for the other
figures. I'm not going to leave Jack now.

31:57.820 --> 32:01.140
# There'll be bluebirds over... #

32:01.175 --> 32:04.420
SONG FADES

32:17.300 --> 32:20.060
ALL-CLEAR SIGNAL WAILS

32:20.095 --> 32:23.117
Let the dancing continue!

32:23.152 --> 32:26.140
ALL CHEER AND APPLAUD

32:28.620 --> 32:33.300
I've finished.
The rest of the equation is hidden.

32:33.335 --> 32:35.065
What happened?

32:35.100 --> 32:37.540
I slipped. I've got a first-aid kit
in the van.

32:40.860 --> 32:42.345
Scotch, Captain?

32:42.380 --> 32:46.940
I'd like some time in private
with Captain Harper.

33:36.420 --> 33:39.580
lanto? Yeah, it's me.
I've found it.

33:41.180 --> 33:43.060
It's written in blood.

33:47.060 --> 33:49.780
Gwen's found the rest
of Tosh's readings.

33:49.815 --> 33:51.745
What's she got for us?

33:51.780 --> 33:57.585
Cos sine squared, axcx = x over 2.

33:57.620 --> 34:03.260
No, I need at least three more numbers,
Gwen. They must be somewhere else.

34:03.295 --> 34:06.537
'No, they're not'.
Well, how do you know?

34:06.572 --> 34:09.780
Somebody scraped out
the final numbers.

34:12.820 --> 34:16.120
Tosh has written
a message at the end.

34:16.155 --> 34:19.420
It says,
"Tell my family I love them. "

34:30.460 --> 34:33.219
Why did you make me
kiss her goodbye?

34:34.820 --> 34:39.219
I just think you should live
every night like it's your last.

34:39.255 --> 34:43.217
Make tonight
the best night of your life.

34:43.252 --> 34:47.179
You're alive -
right here, right now.

34:48.780 --> 34:51.625
Your men are fine.

34:51.659 --> 34:53.500
What are you trying to say?

34:59.780 --> 35:01.540
Go to her.

35:05.620 --> 35:08.620
Go to your woman
and lose yourself in her.

35:11.220 --> 35:13.180
Maybe I should.

35:13.215 --> 35:15.020
Yeah.

35:16.060 --> 35:19.500
Is Toshiko your woman? No.

35:21.300 --> 35:23.980
There's no-one.

35:27.220 --> 35:30.060
Go to her.

35:42.260 --> 35:47.220
It still won't work. There's a piece
missing. Bilis had it all along.

35:47.255 --> 35:49.517
We still don't have
all the equation.

35:49.552 --> 35:51.866
Maybe the machine can work it out.

35:51.901 --> 35:54.380
MACHINE BURSTS INTO LIFE
Owen!

35:54.415 --> 35:56.860
MACHINE ENGINE SPLUTTERS OUT

36:05.340 --> 36:10.300
There must be something in the safe. We need better
instructions. You can't open it. You've no right.

36:10.335 --> 36:13.345
I'm second in command.
I have got every fucking right.

36:13.380 --> 36:18.940
There's stuff we don't know about. That's how
Jack likes it. I won't play with his toys, lanto!

36:25.060 --> 36:28.185
"Rhea Silva,
the god of war's missus. "

36:28.220 --> 36:31.340
And a nine-digit number.
Not so clever, Jack.

37:10.980 --> 37:13.580
Blueprints for the Rift machine.

37:22.860 --> 37:24.860
I thought you'd gone.

37:28.580 --> 37:31.140
This could be your last chance.

37:31.175 --> 37:34.140
That's why I came back.

37:40.220 --> 37:42.580
I might have to leave
before the night is over.

37:43.620 --> 37:47.380
Well, then make the most of now.

37:56.340 --> 37:58.865
WOMAN LAUGHS

37:58.900 --> 38:02.745
We need lovers' corner,
if you don't mind, boys.

38:02.780 --> 38:07.060
Of course. I was just discussing
strategies with the captain.

38:07.095 --> 38:09.060
We'll go somewhere else.

38:09.095 --> 38:10.705
No.

38:10.740 --> 38:12.980
You've told me all I need to know.

38:19.900 --> 38:23.980
There's instructions in here.
This isn't a random act of madness.

38:24.015 --> 38:27.465
It's a trap!
Bilis wanted you to find it. Why?

38:27.500 --> 38:30.920
To provoke the rift. To incite
total chaos and destruction.

38:30.955 --> 38:34.340
All the reports of the haunted
dancehall were anonymous.

38:34.375 --> 38:36.425
What if it was him?

38:36.460 --> 38:40.345
Please, listen to me! I'm tired
of being in awe of the rift.

38:40.380 --> 38:46.620
I'm tired of living with Jack's secrets. We don't
even know who he is. He's our leader. Not any more.

38:48.220 --> 38:49.460
Get out of my way.

38:52.660 --> 38:54.300
lanto! Ugh!

39:11.140 --> 39:14.220
Tomorrow is their last
training exercise,

39:14.255 --> 39:17.105
just another day.

39:17.140 --> 39:18.745
They go out on a sortie

39:18.780 --> 39:21.820
and are surprised
by two formations of Messerschmitts.

39:22.900 --> 39:25.305
He destroys three of the enemy.

39:25.340 --> 39:29.700
His men listen to his whoops of joy
over the radio.

39:32.100 --> 39:33.740
Then it all goes quiet.

39:38.780 --> 39:41.740
He can't bail out
because his whole plane is on fire.

39:41.775 --> 39:45.420
But his men
all make it back to safety.

39:58.260 --> 40:00.380
Put the key down.

40:03.300 --> 40:05.500
Or I'll shoot.

40:05.535 --> 40:07.700
Who were you?

40:09.340 --> 40:11.665
A conman.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.545
That's why I took his name,

40:13.580 --> 40:17.460
falsified his records
so it seemed he was still alive.

40:17.495 --> 40:20.180
How did you end up in Torchwood?

40:21.940 --> 40:24.825
Someone saved my life.

40:24.860 --> 40:26.425
Brought me back from death.

40:26.460 --> 40:31.980
And ever since then, it's been like they're keeping
me for something and I don't know what it is.

40:35.980 --> 40:38.020
I'm sorry for dragging you
into this.

40:38.055 --> 40:40.697
It was my choice.

40:40.732 --> 40:43.340
I'll look after you.

40:50.620 --> 40:53.100
But there's nothing I can do
for him.

41:02.300 --> 41:06.380
You have to let Diane go.
Like I did with Lisa.

41:06.415 --> 41:08.625
Don't compare yourself to me.

41:08.660 --> 41:12.700
You're just a tea boy.
I'm much more than that.

41:12.735 --> 41:15.185
Jack needs me.

41:15.220 --> 41:17.865
In your dreams, lanto.

41:17.900 --> 41:22.860
In your sad wet dreams when
you're his part-time shag, maybe.

41:22.895 --> 41:28.385
That rift took my lover
and my captain.

41:28.420 --> 41:35.860
So if I die trying to beat it, then
it will all be in the line of duty.

41:44.580 --> 41:45.900
Aaargh!

41:52.220 --> 41:54.060
MACHINE STARTS UP

42:00.380 --> 42:03.100
You don't know what you've done.

42:06.660 --> 42:09.900
# That certain night

42:09.935 --> 42:13.105
# The night we met

42:13.140 --> 42:19.625
# There was magic abroad in the air

42:19.660 --> 42:27.265
# There were angels dancing
at the Ritz

42:27.300 --> 42:37.540
# And a nightingale sang
in Berkeley Square... #

42:40.700 --> 42:43.260
#.. I may be right

42:44.140 --> 42:46.940
# I may be wrong... #

42:46.975 --> 42:49.425
What's he doing?

42:49.460 --> 42:53.900
#.. But I'm perfectly willing
to swear... #

43:39.700 --> 43:42.780
RIFT BLASTS OPEN
Jack!

43:44.620 --> 43:46.420
Jack, we need to get out!

43:49.500 --> 43:52.460
Jack, you have to!

43:52.495 --> 43:54.477
We need you!

43:54.512 --> 43:56.460
I have to go.

44:00.220 --> 44:02.020
It's my duty.

45:25.540 --> 45:28.140
Oh, you made it! You made it!

45:28.175 --> 45:31.225
You made it.

45:31.260 --> 45:36.420
Oh, Tosh, come here, come here,
come here! I'm fine!

45:36.455 --> 45:39.020
GWEN LAUGHS

45:47.660 --> 45:50.060
I knew we did the right thing,

45:50.095 --> 45:52.785
opening the rift.

45:52.820 --> 45:54.900
Still no sign of Bilis.

45:56.740 --> 45:59.020
World didn't end after all, did it?

46:01.060 --> 46:04.620
Good job you're a crap shot.
I was aiming for your shoulder.

46:06.380 --> 46:11.460
It was wartime, I know,
but it was beautiful.

46:11.495 --> 46:13.740
There were angels dancing
at the Ritz.

46:17.380 --> 46:18.820
- Jack...
- Let me.

46:32.420 --> 46:35.180
He would have been so proud
that you took his name.

46:35.215 --> 46:39.300
Because here you are,
saving the world.

46:41.460 --> 46:43.180
To Captain Jack.

46:46.780 --> 46:48.220
To Captain Jack.
