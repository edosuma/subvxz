00:05.839 --> 00:07.374
CLYDE: <i>13 Bannerman Road</i>
<i>is where</i>
<i>Sarah Jane Smith lives</i>

00:07.440 --> 00:10.744
<i>and it's home to things</i>
<i>way beyond your imagination.</i>

00:10.810 --> 00:14.214
<i>There's an extraterrestrial,</i>
<i>super computer in the wall,</i>

00:14.280 --> 00:17.550
<i>her son, a genetically</i>
<i>engineered boy genius,</i>

00:17.617 --> 00:20.353
<i>a school girl investigator</i>
<i>across the road</i>

00:20.420 --> 00:23.957
<i>and a whole universe</i>
<i>of adventure</i>
<i>right here on the doorstep.</i>

00:31.331 --> 00:32.866
-Ready?
-Always.

00:49.716 --> 00:53.052
MR SMITH: <i>Meteor redirected</i>
<i>to these co-ordinates.</i>

00:53.119 --> 00:55.889
<i>Strong possibility</i>
<i>of germ pathogens.</i>

00:55.955 --> 00:57.690
We've got to neutralise it.

00:57.757 --> 00:59.759
Rani, bio-coolant.

00:59.826 --> 01:01.961
Clyde, thermo-clamps.

01:03.897 --> 01:04.931
Go, go, go!

01:07.600 --> 01:10.703
If it splits opens,
the germs will escape!
We've got to be quick!

01:21.448 --> 01:23.216
Just in time. Rani?

01:23.283 --> 01:25.084
RANI: On it! (SCREAMS)

01:25.852 --> 01:27.220
Whoa! What was that?

01:29.222 --> 01:30.056
It's reading all clear.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.927
I didn't do anything.

01:35.061 --> 01:36.896
-(BEEPING)
-Something there.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.469
What are you doing here?

01:42.535 --> 01:44.137
Saving the world.

01:44.204 --> 01:45.538
All in a day's work.

01:45.605 --> 01:46.573
Goodbye.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.542
No, wait! Who are you?

01:52.612 --> 01:53.947
(ENGINE STARTS)

01:57.717 --> 01:59.619
She's exactly like you.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.904
She's bad news,
whoever she is.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.473
Last thing we need
is amateurs under our feet.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.342
Well, she looked
pretty professional to me.

02:22.408 --> 02:24.511
Well, she must've
detected the meteor,
so she's got alien tech.

02:24.577 --> 02:25.812
Plus, she knew
what she was doing.

02:25.879 --> 02:27.914
Yeah, well,
I'll get Mr Smith on the case.

02:29.048 --> 02:30.517
We'll find her.

02:37.223 --> 02:38.925
Wait, wait, wait.
What did I just see?

02:40.727 --> 02:42.495
RANI: Uh, we've found her.

02:42.896 --> 02:43.930
What?

02:49.335 --> 02:51.538
There was a big furniture van
out there the other day.

02:51.604 --> 02:54.374
Wonder Woman's moved in
down the road.

02:54.440 --> 02:55.942
Ah, you left
the hand brake off!

02:57.477 --> 03:00.013
-I must be getting old.
-(CHUCKLES)

03:00.079 --> 03:01.447
So, what now?

03:01.514 --> 03:04.717
Well, we find out exactly
what's going on here.

03:14.661 --> 03:15.929
(KNOCKING)

03:23.536 --> 03:24.704
We need to talk.

03:24.771 --> 03:26.172
You followed me?

03:26.239 --> 03:27.740
We only live over there.

03:27.807 --> 03:30.076
Like I care. Get lost.

03:30.143 --> 03:31.678
Not good enough!

03:33.379 --> 03:34.447
Ah!

03:36.482 --> 03:38.151
Get out of my house!

03:38.217 --> 03:40.954
I've been door-stepping
since I was 19.

03:41.020 --> 03:42.956
Those days at the
<i>South Croydon Echo</i>
never left her.

03:43.156 --> 03:45.892
You're a journalist.
I might have known.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.860
Get out
or I'll call the police.

03:47.927 --> 03:49.629
You don't really
want to do that.

03:49.696 --> 03:52.599
Not with alien technology
lying about the place.

03:52.665 --> 03:55.068
You have no idea
what you're getting into here,

03:55.134 --> 03:56.970
or you wouldn't be
bringing kids with you.

03:58.805 --> 04:00.173
Yeah, well, wherever I go,

04:00.974 --> 04:01.975
they go.

04:03.409 --> 04:04.711
You get one minute.

04:04.777 --> 04:06.212
What's your name?

04:06.279 --> 04:08.147
-What's yours?
-Ruby White.

04:08.214 --> 04:09.549
Uh, put that down!

04:09.616 --> 04:11.451
Who do you think you are?

04:11.517 --> 04:13.319
You just used
a bio-coolant spray

04:13.386 --> 04:15.822
on a meteor you couldn't
possibly know
had fallen to Earth,

04:15.888 --> 04:18.291
to destroy germs
you couldn't possibly
have known it contained.

04:18.358 --> 04:19.791
Would you like to explain?

04:19.858 --> 04:22.128
All of which
equally applies to you.

04:22.195 --> 04:24.931
(SIGHS) Don't think
I haven't met amateurs before.

04:26.799 --> 04:28.935
(SCOFFS) Why this house?

04:30.570 --> 04:31.938
Why move here?

04:33.906 --> 04:37.977
This area, they call it
the Ealing Triangle.

04:38.044 --> 04:40.179
Trueman, the astrologer,
happened here.

04:40.246 --> 04:42.448
The Bubbleshock factory,
10 minutes away.

04:42.515 --> 04:45.051
-(WATCH BEEPS)
-Reports of rhinos
in police cars,

04:45.118 --> 04:47.553
alien plant life.
Shall I go on?

04:47.620 --> 04:49.389
How very peculiar.

04:49.455 --> 04:52.625
(CHUCKLES)
Your little cub reporters
not taking notes?

04:52.692 --> 04:53.660
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

04:55.962 --> 04:57.797
My name's Sarah Jane Smith.

04:57.864 --> 04:59.399
I'm not an amateur.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.100
I don't think you are either.

05:04.037 --> 05:07.173
I don't care what you think.
Your minute's up. Get out.

05:12.211 --> 05:13.012
Now!

05:25.291 --> 05:26.693
MR SMITH: <i>Ruby Ann White.</i>

05:26.759 --> 05:29.696
<i>First class degree</i>
<i>in biophysics from Oxford,</i>

05:29.762 --> 05:31.731
<i>attached to the</i>
<i>Auckland Institute,</i>

05:31.798 --> 05:33.332
<i>recently returned</i>
<i>from New Zealand.</i>

05:33.399 --> 05:35.768
Okay. Save the rest for later.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.537
Hmm.

05:37.603 --> 05:39.672
You got to admit,
she sounds kosher.

05:39.739 --> 05:41.941
Yeah, just like us,
except ruder.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.650
-Sarah Jane?
-Hmm?

05:50.717 --> 05:52.618
Oh, sorry.
What were we talking about?

05:52.685 --> 05:54.587
Uh, Ruby White?

05:54.654 --> 05:56.756
Oh, sorry. I was miles away.

05:58.324 --> 06:00.460
(CHUCKLES)
So what do we do about her?

06:00.526 --> 06:01.928
What she wants. We stay away.

06:04.397 --> 06:07.333
Yeah, but we keep
our eyes open.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.768
Right, you two, home.

06:08.835 --> 06:10.903
It's been a long day.

06:10.970 --> 06:12.138
You okay, Sarah Jane?

06:12.205 --> 06:13.639
Fine. Bye.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.055
-No, this one.
-Oh!

06:29.122 --> 06:30.957
(GASPS) Did you see
that face, then?

06:31.023 --> 06:32.091
So cheeky.

06:34.660 --> 06:37.029
Ooh! Hello, new neighbour!

06:37.096 --> 06:39.098
-Hello.
-Hello. Afternoon.

06:42.168 --> 06:44.837
Oh, charming.
Frosty the Snowwoman.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.106
Yeah, maybe she's got
her reasons.

06:47.173 --> 06:48.374
CHANDRA: Somebody
knows something.

06:48.441 --> 06:50.576
-Yeah, went round there
the other day.
-(GASPS)

06:50.643 --> 06:52.145
Just to say hello.

06:52.211 --> 06:54.413
Hello, Clyde.
Oh, secret new friend?

06:54.480 --> 06:55.648
Why wasn't I invited?

06:55.715 --> 06:56.849
She's not the friendly type.

06:56.916 --> 06:57.884
Hello, sir.

07:00.386 --> 07:02.755
You know, I'm still
not feeling the yellow.

07:02.822 --> 07:04.590
CHANDRA: It was Gita's idea!

07:04.657 --> 07:07.527
It's like summer
all year round.

07:07.593 --> 07:08.995
Number 46, is she?

07:09.061 --> 07:10.897
I've always wanted
to look in there,

07:10.963 --> 07:13.266
but she was a right ratbag,
that old Mrs Kuthrapali.

07:13.332 --> 07:15.201
Gita, the woman's
only been dead a month.

07:16.836 --> 07:18.738
Afternoon, Sarah!

07:18.805 --> 07:20.873
Oh, hi! Can't stop.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.341
Have to put Luke's tea on.

07:22.408 --> 07:24.610
Is Luke back? Rani didn't say.

07:24.677 --> 07:26.312
What?

07:26.379 --> 07:28.414
No. No, he's not back...

07:28.481 --> 07:29.849
Sorry, excuse me.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.185
Oh, shall I go over?

07:32.251 --> 07:33.853
No, Mum, leave her alone.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.655
Um, come on, Clyde,
we need to go
pick up that stuff.

07:37.356 --> 07:38.124
Bye.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.195
Come on, Haresh.

07:48.167 --> 07:52.738
Look, I know she's been
acting a bit weird,
but that was off the scale!

07:52.805 --> 07:55.808
Oh, and now she's left
the door open.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.978
You know what,
she needs a holiday.

07:59.045 --> 08:01.581
-You're right. Let's tell her.
-No, wait!

08:01.647 --> 08:04.483
You hang back five minutes,
I'll do it.

08:07.420 --> 08:08.855
<i>Mum, is something wrong?</i>

08:08.921 --> 08:12.391
No, nothing.
Just wanted a chat.
Missing you.

08:12.458 --> 08:13.993
<i>Already?</i>

08:14.060 --> 08:15.895
<i>It's only been a couple</i>
<i>of hours since you called.</i>

08:15.962 --> 08:18.431
Well, Mum's prerogative.
How's, um...

08:18.497 --> 08:20.900
Oh, what's his name?
Metal dog.

08:20.967 --> 08:22.435
<i>You mean K9?</i>

08:22.501 --> 08:24.904
<i>Yeah, he's good.</i>

08:24.971 --> 08:26.505
<i>Mum, are you sure</i>
<i>you're all right?</i>

08:26.572 --> 08:29.675
Yes, I'm absolutely fine!

08:29.742 --> 08:31.310
<i>-Hey, Rani.</i>
-Hi, Luke.

08:31.377 --> 08:33.546
Don't worry, I'm keeping
your mum out of trouble.

08:33.613 --> 08:35.648
<i>Oh, tough job.</i>

08:35.715 --> 08:38.985
<i>Listen, I said I'd meet Sanjay</i>
<i>back at the Union.</i>
<i>Gotta go, okay?</i>

08:39.051 --> 08:40.720
<i>See you later. Bye.</i>

08:42.054 --> 08:43.089
Love you.

08:44.724 --> 08:46.692
Right, what can I do you for?

08:46.759 --> 08:48.527
You are not all right,
Sarah Jane.

08:48.594 --> 08:51.631
Oh, yeah, I've been
waiting for this, Rani.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.733
I forget something,

08:53.799 --> 08:57.603
I make a silly mistake,
and you blow it into
this big disaster.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.810
-(SIGHS)
-No, I'm not even
going to try.

09:06.445 --> 09:09.181
Hey, you're missing Luke.

09:09.248 --> 09:11.150
Yes, of course,
but now it's not just that.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.853
It's like...
I can't concentrate.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.389
When was the last time
you took a holiday,
a proper holiday?

09:16.455 --> 09:18.557
Oh, no. I love my work.
I don't need one.

09:18.624 --> 09:20.626
When was the last time?

09:20.693 --> 09:24.030
Look, I can't put a sign
on the dark side of the Moon,

09:24.096 --> 09:27.300
"Oh, don't invade this week,
'cause old Smith,
she's on her hols."

09:27.366 --> 09:28.768
(BOTH LAUGH)

09:28.834 --> 09:31.637
Go and see Luke.
Just for a few days.

09:31.704 --> 09:33.339
He only lives an hour
down the road.

Rani, take that!

10:45.444 --> 10:46.579
Clyde.

10:50.282 --> 10:51.584
Your hour has come.

10:51.650 --> 10:52.918
What are you doing?

this planet.

-By any means!
-Are you serious?

SARAH JANE: More than
I've ever been.

10:59.091 --> 11:01.627

to let him fire that?

11:01.694 --> 11:03.396
Sarah Jane,
this is not like you.

11:03.462 --> 11:05.931
Oh, stop talking and move!

11:17.076 --> 11:18.711
RANI: How many
do you think there are?

11:18.778 --> 11:21.981
CLYDE: Should we split up?
SARAH JANE: No! Stay close.

Whoa! Down, down!

11:39.065 --> 11:40.299
They're coming!

11:40.366 --> 11:41.367
They won't kill us
till they've scanned us.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.668
First indigenous specimens.

11:42.735 --> 11:43.969
Fireworks are just
scare tactics.

11:44.170 --> 11:45.771
Well, the scare tactics
are working!

11:45.838 --> 11:47.540
We need them close.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.776
ALL: Oh!

11:50.843 --> 11:53.079
They're ruthlessly logical.
This is a scan blind.

11:53.145 --> 11:54.613
It will overload
their sensors.

11:54.680 --> 11:55.915
They'll think
we're tougher than them,
the fleet withdraws.

11:55.981 --> 11:57.716
-Ya-de-ya-de-ya. Simple.
-Then use it!

11:57.783 --> 11:59.518
(COCKING GUN)

11:59.585 --> 12:02.054
They're close enough!
Need to activate it.
Clyde, the sonic!

12:02.121 --> 12:04.223
-I don't have it!
-What? I told you to bring it!

12:04.290 --> 12:05.558
You said bring this!

12:05.624 --> 12:07.059
What good's that?
It's not even charged!

12:07.126 --> 12:08.094
-(EXPLOSION)
-(SCREAMS)

12:08.794 --> 12:10.996
Well, what's Plan B?

12:11.063 --> 12:13.866
There is no Plan B!
Oh, I've got us killed.

12:14.700 --> 12:15.935

12:17.937 --> 12:19.171

12:23.442 --> 12:26.112
I'm so sorry. Oh, Luke.

12:26.178 --> 12:27.780
Dark Horde warriors!

12:30.616 --> 12:32.585
You got it wrong, boys.

12:32.651 --> 12:35.087
Scan over here.

12:35.154 --> 12:37.523
Wait till you see
what I've got for you.

12:39.925 --> 12:42.895
Clyde, Rani, trust me!

12:42.962 --> 12:45.097
Clyde, left! Rani, right!

12:49.969 --> 12:51.036
Catch!

press the buttons!

13:07.286 --> 13:08.053
Now!

13:25.905 --> 13:26.972
RUBY: Is everyone all right?

13:27.039 --> 13:27.973
Wait, what did you just do?

13:29.575 --> 13:31.010
You mean, what did we do?

13:31.076 --> 13:33.145
MALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
<i>Dark Horde fleet retreating.</i>

13:33.212 --> 13:34.380
What's that?

<i>I'm an artificial</i>
<i>intelligence.</i>

13:36.615 --> 13:38.317
<i>-Hello.</i>
-CLYDE: Hello.

13:38.384 --> 13:39.385
Somebody explain.

13:39.451 --> 13:41.554
<i>With your help,</i>
<i>I reflected back</i>

13:41.620 --> 13:44.790
<i>to the Horde an image</i>
<i>of a slightly stronger</i>
<i>version of themselves.</i>

13:44.857 --> 13:46.692
<i>Their logical reaction</i>
<i>was to flee.</i>

13:46.759 --> 13:48.060
-Cool!
-(RANI CHUCKLES)

13:48.127 --> 13:50.196
-Should call him Mr White.
-(CHUCKLES)

13:50.262 --> 13:53.199
Ruby, you saved our lives,
you saved the Earth!

13:53.265 --> 13:54.533
You are amazing!

13:54.600 --> 13:56.902
No, I've been doing
my research.

13:56.969 --> 13:59.371
If anyone's amazing,
it's you, Sarah Jane.

13:59.438 --> 14:03.776
(SIGHS) Rani Chandra,
Clyde Langer,
thank you both.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.711
I don't think we were
properly introduced last time,

14:05.778 --> 14:09.448
which is my fault,
jumping to conclusions.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.016
You're no amateurs.

14:13.619 --> 14:16.689
If that handshake is still
on offer, Sarah Jane?

14:21.327 --> 14:22.928
Welcome to the attic.

14:23.929 --> 14:25.898
Wow, this is incredible!

14:25.965 --> 14:27.733
MR SMITH:
<i>And rather unexpected.</i>

14:27.800 --> 14:29.835
Ruby White,
say hello to Mr Smith.

14:29.902 --> 14:33.572
-She's a friend.
-Mr Smith, wow, hello!

14:33.639 --> 14:35.741
Makes my revelation look
a little less impressive.

14:35.808 --> 14:39.011
Nah, he's good. Pocket-sized!

14:39.078 --> 14:42.581
Mr White, I like that.
Reminds me of my dad.

14:42.648 --> 14:44.750
RANI: Where did you get him?
RUBY: New Zealand.

14:44.817 --> 14:46.218
Dredged him out of a swamp.

14:46.285 --> 14:48.053
I couldn't turn him
into the authorities.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.489
They would just strip
him down and use him
as a weapon of war.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.625
Mr Smith, meet Mr White.

14:52.691 --> 14:54.026
MR WHITE: <i>Hello, Mr Smith.</i>

14:54.093 --> 14:56.328
MR SMITH: <i>Well, you're</i>
<i>certainly the most</i>

<i>agreeable artificial</i>
<i>intelligence I've met since</i>
<i>I've been on this planet.</i>

14:59.365 --> 15:01.700
MR WHITE: <i>You're not</i>
<i>so bad yourself, Smithy.</i>

15:01.767 --> 15:03.902
RUBY: There's so much
out there.

15:03.969 --> 15:06.639
Aliens, civilisations.

15:06.705 --> 15:08.073
When I was a kid,
I never dreamed

15:08.140 --> 15:10.976
the universe could be
so strange and beautiful.

15:11.043 --> 15:13.946
Finally, people
I can talk to about all this.
It's like a dream.

15:14.013 --> 15:16.515
-Well, welcome to the club.
-(CHUCKLES)

15:16.582 --> 15:17.816
(DOOR OPENS)

15:19.385 --> 15:22.054
-I really like her.
-Yeah, me, too!

15:22.121 --> 15:24.023
She's so much
like Sarah Jane.

15:24.089 --> 15:25.457
Cooler car, though.

15:25.524 --> 15:27.526
This is proper good news.
We've got a new mate.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.728
Sarah Jane's got someone
to take the pressure off.

15:29.795 --> 15:32.031
Isn't that what we're for?

15:32.097 --> 15:33.499
Oh, I love Clyde and Rani.

15:33.565 --> 15:37.770
They're great kids,
but they're a different
generation.

15:37.836 --> 15:39.838
I could do
with a grown-up friend.

15:39.905 --> 15:41.573
Well, I need a friend, too.

15:41.640 --> 15:45.077
I got you so wrong
the other day.
My big mouth.

15:45.144 --> 15:47.346
No, no, you were right
about one thing.

15:47.413 --> 15:51.417
I put children in danger.
Today, I nearly
got them killed.

15:51.483 --> 15:54.420
Sonic lipstick, which I take
everywhere with me.

15:54.486 --> 15:57.022
Except this afternoon,
when I really needed it.

15:57.089 --> 15:59.391
Sonic lipstick?

15:59.458 --> 16:02.561
(LAUGHING) Well,
now I really feel inadequate.

16:04.963 --> 16:06.965
You've led a normal life.

16:07.166 --> 16:09.835
Nothing's been normal for me.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.704
I was 23,
thought I knew it all.

16:11.770 --> 16:15.341
Just another day,
chasing a story,
trying to make my name.

16:15.407 --> 16:17.810
Then my world
turned upside down.

16:17.876 --> 16:19.078
Oh, no. What happened?

16:19.144 --> 16:20.579
I met him, didn't I?

16:20.646 --> 16:22.247
The man who changed my life.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.916
-Who's that?
-He's...

16:27.119 --> 16:27.920
Um...

16:30.422 --> 16:34.226
Oh, it's the Doc...
Yes, the Doctor!

16:34.293 --> 16:37.529
Look, I'm terrible
with names, too.
It's no big deal.

16:39.565 --> 16:40.833
(FAST-FORWARDING)

16:40.899 --> 16:43.068
<i>The man who changed my life.</i>

16:43.135 --> 16:44.937
<i>-Who's that?</i>
<i>-He's...</i>

16:47.673 --> 16:48.974
<i>Um...</i>

16:49.041 --> 16:51.043
<i>Oh, it's the Doc...</i>
<i>Yes, the Doctor!</i>

16:52.478 --> 16:54.012
<i>Look, I'm terrible</i>
<i>with names, too.</i>

16:54.079 --> 16:55.514
Finish replay.

16:56.982 --> 17:00.686
How could I forget his name,
even for a second?

17:02.588 --> 17:03.856
How could I?

17:07.659 --> 17:09.895
Mr Smith,
I want a full medi-scan.

17:09.962 --> 17:12.498
-MR SMITH: <i>Of Ruby?</i>
-Of me.

17:12.564 --> 17:14.165
-Do it.
<i>-Complying.</i>

17:17.903 --> 17:19.605
<i>Compiling scan data.</i>

17:20.839 --> 17:22.741
<i>Sarah Jane,</i>
<i>I do not know how to...</i>

17:22.808 --> 17:24.576
Well, just tell me!

17:24.643 --> 17:28.046
<i>There is evidence</i>
<i>of deterioration</i>
<i>of brain tissue,</i>

17:28.113 --> 17:32.518
<i>cognitive dysfunction,</i>
<i>impaired reaction times.</i>

17:32.584 --> 17:36.021
<i>Damage is not serious,</i>
<i>but it cannot be treated.</i>

17:36.088 --> 17:38.924
<i>I am sorry.</i>
<i>You are very ill indeed.</i>

17:42.127 --> 17:43.128
Mmm-hmm.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.733
Listen,
in my current condition,

17:47.800 --> 17:49.768
should I be given
a position

17:49.835 --> 17:53.505
of responsibility
and authority
over other people's lives?

17:53.572 --> 17:55.207
<i>Sarah Jane, it is not my...</i>

17:55.274 --> 17:56.942
I want an answer!

17:57.643 --> 17:58.644
<i>No.</i>

17:59.611 --> 18:01.113
Thank you, Mr Smith.

18:03.982 --> 18:08.020
So, no one's irreplaceable.

18:09.188 --> 18:09.988
(SCOFFS)

18:14.393 --> 18:16.061
-Try it.
-(BEEPING)

18:16.128 --> 18:17.896
-It won't bite.
-(LAUGHS)

18:21.233 --> 18:22.568
(ALL LAUGH)

18:27.806 --> 18:29.007
It pongs, though!

18:34.012 --> 18:35.547
GITA: Are you sure
about this, Ru?

18:35.614 --> 18:37.616
Mum, it's only one lesson!

18:38.684 --> 18:40.252
Bye, Mrs Chandra.

18:40.319 --> 18:42.087
Oh, Ru, call me Gita.

18:42.154 --> 18:43.522
Call me Ruby.

18:50.362 --> 18:51.463
Ruby.

18:52.898 --> 18:54.900
I can't do this any more.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.835
What? Don't be stupid!

18:56.902 --> 19:00.506
Mr Smith scanned me.
Second best doctor I know.

19:00.572 --> 19:03.408
I'm getting old,
it's too much for me.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.611
Ruby, look at my hands.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.413
You need to calm down.

19:08.480 --> 19:12.251
Now, listen! I am ill.
My life has made me ill.

19:12.317 --> 19:16.889
I'm old and I'm tired
and...I'm dangerous.

19:16.955 --> 19:19.958
I nearly got Clyde
and Rani killed and... No!

19:20.158 --> 19:22.294
That must never happen again.

19:22.361 --> 19:26.665
No, it's over. I'm over.
My story is finished.

19:26.732 --> 19:30.135
But this planet,
it needs someone
to protect it.

19:30.202 --> 19:33.605
Are you that person?
Are you the woman
I think you are?

19:34.873 --> 19:36.208
You want me to take over?

19:36.275 --> 19:38.176
Oh, you're so much
like I used to be.

19:38.243 --> 19:41.213
Uh, wait, wait, wait.
We need to stop and think.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.148
We do not have time.
And we don't need to think.

19:43.215 --> 19:46.151
You're the only other
person in the world
who could do this.

19:46.218 --> 19:48.921
I wouldn't ask
unless I was completely sure.

19:50.255 --> 19:51.957
If you agree,
you get this house,

19:52.024 --> 19:54.693
you get Mr Smith,
you get Clyde, Rani,
you get everything.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.028
Yes or no?

19:56.094 --> 19:58.497
I can't suddenly decide
something this big.

19:58.564 --> 19:59.865
Yes or no?

20:04.169 --> 20:04.937
Yes.

20:06.371 --> 20:07.472
Right.

20:09.775 --> 20:11.076
Well, I'm leaving right now.

20:12.611 --> 20:14.012
You can't be serious.

20:14.079 --> 20:17.149
I have to. If I don't,
I'll change my mind.

20:17.215 --> 20:19.718
-Well, what about Luke?
-Doesn't need me any more.

20:19.785 --> 20:23.422
He's got his own life
and I won't be
a burden to him.

20:23.488 --> 20:26.458
It's harsh,
but this life is harsh.

20:27.359 --> 20:28.994
Just remember,

20:29.061 --> 20:31.697
one day,
this'll happen to you.

20:31.763 --> 20:34.533
So, it's a deal?

20:39.237 --> 20:40.606
It's a deal.

20:42.441 --> 20:44.476
Right.

20:44.543 --> 20:49.314
Mr Smith, program Alpha 3,
you delete my voice
from the command program.

20:49.381 --> 20:52.517
Your orders now come
from Ruby White.

20:52.584 --> 20:54.419
MR SMITH: <i>Do you think</i>
<i>that is wise, Sarah Jane?</i>

20:54.486 --> 20:55.954
It's an order!

20:57.089 --> 20:58.523
My last order.

21:04.396 --> 21:05.931
<i>Con... Confirmed.</i>

21:08.600 --> 21:10.969
RUBY: So, Sarah Jane,

21:11.169 --> 21:13.105
what are you going
to do with yourself now?

21:13.805 --> 21:15.540
No plans. Um...

21:15.607 --> 21:18.844
I'm just going to drive off
and see where I end up.

21:19.611 --> 21:20.579
Well, um...

21:22.414 --> 21:23.882
It's all yours.

21:26.652 --> 21:27.719
Keys.

21:28.553 --> 21:29.955
And the watch.

21:32.290 --> 21:33.492
Oh, yes.

21:34.726 --> 21:36.495
I mustn't forget this.

21:38.163 --> 21:40.932
Yes, now you've
got everything.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.135
Thank you.

21:43.201 --> 21:45.070
(WHIMPERS)

21:45.137 --> 21:47.572
-Oh, are you okay?
-I'm fine.

21:49.074 --> 21:51.410
We're all going to miss you,
Sarah Jane.

21:51.476 --> 21:54.846
Me and all your little chums.

21:54.913 --> 21:59.685
Wonderful, brilliant Rani,
and amazing, plucky Clyde.

22:01.486 --> 22:03.088
Oh, and your son.

22:06.658 --> 22:09.795
Lukey wukey pukey.

22:09.861 --> 22:11.830
But you don't want these.

22:11.897 --> 22:12.998
Your mind's made up.

22:13.065 --> 22:15.133
No looking back,
no goodbyes.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.369
You're a hard woman,
Sarah Jane.

22:17.436 --> 22:20.439
What am I going to tell
those poor, poor kids?

22:20.505 --> 22:21.773
Wait, stop, I can't think.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.675
There's no time to think,
you said.

22:23.742 --> 22:26.111
And no one's going
to change your mind,
least of all me.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.546
No, I can't leave.

22:27.612 --> 22:29.648
-You can't?
-Not like this.

22:29.715 --> 22:31.917
I didn't even say
goodbye to Luke.

22:33.585 --> 22:35.420
It's the way you wanted it.

22:35.487 --> 22:37.756
Mr Smith,
get Luke on the screen.

22:40.025 --> 22:40.926
Mr Smith.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.829
Well, he's not answering.

22:43.895 --> 22:47.065
Oh, (CHUCKLES) silly me.

22:47.132 --> 22:50.268
Your voice has been erased
from the command program,
hasn't it?

22:50.335 --> 22:52.838
Yes, Ruby, please,
patch me back in.

22:52.904 --> 22:54.072
I must talk to my son.

22:55.941 --> 22:56.875
No.

22:57.809 --> 22:59.211
What?

22:59.277 --> 23:00.045
Ruby, please.

23:02.013 --> 23:03.915
-What's happening?
-Oh.

23:03.982 --> 23:07.052
What's happening is
you're not in charge any more.

23:07.119 --> 23:10.856
You gave me these.
You gave me this place.

23:10.922 --> 23:12.557
And you gave me yourself.

23:12.624 --> 23:14.326
-What?
-Well, what's left of you.

23:14.392 --> 23:15.694
-Ruby, no.
-Oh.

23:15.761 --> 23:17.095
Shh, shh, don't struggle.

23:23.368 --> 23:25.303
Uh, where are we?

23:25.370 --> 23:27.572
You've got your secret attic.

23:27.639 --> 23:29.040
Welcome to my secret cellar.

23:33.612 --> 23:35.080
Lord, what is that?

23:36.848 --> 23:38.049
You mean over there?

23:43.054 --> 23:44.956
That's my stomach.

23:45.157 --> 23:47.159
And it's hungry for your soul.

23:48.193 --> 23:50.061
Yes, you are ill.

23:50.128 --> 23:51.530
I made you ill.

23:51.596 --> 23:54.900
I've been draining you dry,
sucking your life force

23:54.966 --> 23:57.969
every time we met,
drop by drop.

23:59.404 --> 24:00.672
Would you like to see?

24:00.739 --> 24:02.541
Ruby, please. Ruby, no.

24:02.607 --> 24:03.775
Ruby...

24:08.180 --> 24:09.848
What are you?

24:09.915 --> 24:11.783
I am Qetesh.

24:11.850 --> 24:15.954
My race devours the excitement
and excesses of life,

24:16.021 --> 24:18.890
the adventures,
the terrors, the thrills.

24:18.957 --> 24:21.393
That's why I came for you.

24:21.459 --> 24:24.196
Yours is the most
exciting life on the planet.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.598
I trusted you.

24:26.665 --> 24:28.099
(CHUCKLES) Well...

24:29.301 --> 24:30.969
I did my homework.

24:31.036 --> 24:34.206
The meteor,
playing hard to get,

24:34.272 --> 24:36.675
saving you
from the Dark Horde.

24:38.009 --> 24:40.779
Oh, you saw yourself in me.

24:41.713 --> 24:43.648
And so did Clyde and Rani.

24:43.715 --> 24:45.584
Yeah, well, they'll find me.

24:45.650 --> 24:48.153
Hmm, no.

24:48.220 --> 24:49.855
Right now, Mr White
is back in the attic

24:49.921 --> 24:53.191
preparing a very, very
touching farewell message.

24:53.258 --> 24:55.293
Clyde and Rani
will believe you've gone

24:55.360 --> 24:56.595
because you're going
to tell them.

24:57.128 --> 24:57.929
No!

25:01.233 --> 25:03.368
You handed me your life.

25:03.435 --> 25:07.005
Now my stomach
can drain you directly.

25:17.682 --> 25:20.018
Soon it will drain
you completely,

25:20.952 --> 25:22.921
and then my adventure begins!

25:24.456 --> 25:27.525
I will feast on this world.

25:33.932 --> 25:36.902
Soon, no one on this planet
will be safe from me!

25:36.968 --> 25:38.737
<i>Ruby is taking my place.</i>

25:38.803 --> 25:40.372
You put this in her head
and now she's gone,

25:40.438 --> 25:42.407
just like my dad's gone!
And it's all your fault!

25:42.474 --> 25:44.376
That isn't me!

25:44.442 --> 25:46.011
I'm almost upsetting myself.

25:46.077 --> 25:48.813
You've got to get
this message.
You've got to help!

25:48.880 --> 25:51.316
She would never, ever
just run off.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.985
K9: <i>UNIT is of Qetesh origin.</i>

25:54.052 --> 25:57.055
It's the only way, or Clyde
and Sarah Jane will die.
