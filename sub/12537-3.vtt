_

01:08.372 --> 01:09.906
Early yesterday evening,

01:09.941 --> 01:12.976
witnesses reported seeing
two men on bikes throw...

01:21.886 --> 01:24.254
No!

01:24.288 --> 01:27.457
No! No! No, no!

01:38.903 --> 01:41.938
..are believed to be
workers from the restaurant.

01:41.973 --> 01:45.575
We're told that a police raid was going on
at the time at the back of the restaurant

01:45.610 --> 01:47.878
but we are also being told
it is unrelated.

01:47.912 --> 01:50.947
- Fuck.
- Hey, Evie.

01:59.290 --> 02:01.358
- Hello?
- Hi.

02:03.461 --> 02:05.929
Hi. You okay?

02:06.931 --> 02:09.132
- Yeah.
- Want me to get Evie?

02:09.166 --> 02:12.269
- Please.
- Okay. Hold on.

02:13.304 --> 02:15.972
Take it. And watch that.

02:16.007 --> 02:17.274
Hi.

02:17.308 --> 02:20.677
Hey, baby, I'm just checking
in, see how you're doing.

02:23.648 --> 02:26.383
Look, I'm sorry about
yesterday, with the dinner.

02:26.417 --> 02:29.486
- We'll do it again. Right?
- Don't sweat it. I gotta go.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.554
- Evie, wait.
- I'm gonna be late for school.

02:31.589 --> 02:33.590
Evie.

02:55.613 --> 02:57.681
Thank you.

03:05.089 --> 03:06.923
So, how's he doing?

03:08.492 --> 03:10.927
Detective Fleming inhaled
a lot of smoke.

03:10.962 --> 03:13.196
They're still running tests
right now.

03:14.198 --> 03:16.499
Early signs are
it shouldn't be too bad.

03:16.534 --> 03:18.768
Something to be thankful for.

03:18.803 --> 03:22.072
- He's one tough cop.
- He's a cop, period.

03:22.106 --> 03:25.942
Find out which bastards
did this and nail them.

03:27.211 --> 03:29.379
We owe Detective Fleming that.

03:35.586 --> 03:38.855
- You think it's Karabas?
- Jimmy Laszlo.

03:38.889 --> 03:42.959
- Why Laszlo? - Someone took out
his bookkeeper, Tony Aldon.

03:42.994 --> 03:45.528
It's looking like Clay Street.
Could be payback.

03:45.563 --> 03:47.297
If he wanted to hit
the Lee brothers,

03:47.331 --> 03:50.300
Laszlo wouldn't just take out
a couple of waiters.

03:50.334 --> 03:53.003
- Someone in his crew?
- Someone with a death wish.

03:53.037 --> 03:56.673
- Jimmy will be pissed off if he didn't sign
off on it. - What about his eldest son?

03:56.707 --> 03:59.342
- Alec?
- Some kind of a hothead, isn't he?

03:59.377 --> 04:02.278
Crude'd be his middle name
if he could spell it, but...

04:02.313 --> 04:03.813
Yeah. It could be him.

04:06.484 --> 04:08.485
Come down hard on Laszlo.

04:11.389 --> 04:13.423
- Light 'em up.
- Yes, sir.

04:38.182 --> 04:40.483
Hello, sweetheart.

04:41.819 --> 04:43.920
I missed you.

04:43.954 --> 04:46.990
Oh, you missed me?
Oh, how much? Mm?

04:47.024 --> 04:49.626
This much?

04:52.263 --> 04:54.497
- Dad.
- Morning, Jimmy.

04:54.532 --> 04:58.034
How about Mom takes you
for ice cream? Hm?

04:59.603 --> 05:01.838
There you go. Good girl.

05:01.872 --> 05:03.873
Come here, baby.

05:03.908 --> 05:05.708
What do you say to Grandpa?

05:05.743 --> 05:09.112
- Thank you, Grandpa.
- You're welcome, sweetheart.

05:09.146 --> 05:11.181
- Go to Mommy.
- Come on, babes.

05:17.855 --> 05:19.856
Bye-bye.

05:22.393 --> 05:24.127
What?

05:24.161 --> 05:27.297
How could you be
so fucking stupid? Hm?

05:27.331 --> 05:28.932
Dad!

05:31.035 --> 05:33.803
- We had to do something.
- You don't fuckin' listen.

05:33.838 --> 05:35.839
- We had to hit back.
- I had it in hand.

05:35.873 --> 05:38.475
- I had it under control
- People were laughing at us.

05:38.509 --> 05:42.412
- There were cops in there.
- How was I supposed to know that?

05:42.446 --> 05:46.583
Do you have any idea of the shit storm
that's coming down on us? On me.

05:46.617 --> 05:48.751
- How could I have known?
- I told you to wait!

05:48.786 --> 05:51.488
Wait? Wait for what?
We knew who hit us.

05:51.522 --> 05:54.524
Fucking Clay Street!
What was I supposed to do, dad?

05:54.558 --> 05:56.626
Wait for them
to come at us again, huh?

05:56.660 --> 05:59.262
Get lucky, put one
between your eyes?

05:59.296 --> 06:02.499
- I did it for you.
- Ha! Jesus.

06:02.533 --> 06:05.168
So, okay, I didn't know
about the fucking cops.

06:05.202 --> 06:08.238
But we had a move.
You've got to admit that.

06:09.373 --> 06:11.341
It wasn't Clay Street.

06:11.375 --> 06:15.044
- What?
- It wasn't them. They didn't hit us.

06:15.079 --> 06:16.746
What do you mean?
How do you know?

06:16.780 --> 06:20.183
Because I make sure I have
all the facts before I act.

06:20.217 --> 06:23.620
- Who, then?
- Not Clay Street.

06:28.526 --> 06:29.893
Dad, I...

06:29.927 --> 06:31.761
You're sorry?

06:31.795 --> 06:33.963
Now I gotta clean up
your fuckin' mess.

06:33.998 --> 06:36.065
Like I haven't got enough
on my plate.

06:36.100 --> 06:40.236
I've spent a lifetime cleaning
up your fucking shit!

06:46.210 --> 06:47.744
Fuck!

07:19.543 --> 07:21.511
Mm-hm.

07:21.545 --> 07:23.813
Inside.

07:42.032 --> 07:45.101
Please tell me you had
nothing to do with this.

07:45.135 --> 07:48.371
Christ, Jimmy! I fuckin' told
you it wasn't Clay Street.

07:52.243 --> 07:53.710
So who did it?

07:56.947 --> 07:59.849
My God. Alec? It was Alec?

07:59.883 --> 08:02.018
Fuck!

08:02.786 --> 08:05.021
- How could you let this happen?
- Careful.

08:05.055 --> 08:08.024
You have any idea
what he's done?

08:08.058 --> 08:10.326
He got an officer in the hospital.
Cops could've died.

08:10.361 --> 08:12.262
You think I'm not aware
of that?

08:12.296 --> 08:14.864
They are gonna rain down
on you.

08:16.533 --> 08:19.869
Yeah. So what's the plan? You gonna
strap on the six-shooter?

08:19.903 --> 08:24.007
Whoever set you up, you'll be
playing right into their hands.

08:24.041 --> 08:27.944
Why'd they make it look like Clay
Street were coming at you? Huh?

08:27.978 --> 08:30.413
They wanna spark a gang war.
Destabilize you.

08:30.447 --> 08:34.017
So what? I sit tight? See who comes to
the door first-- Clay Street or cops?

08:34.051 --> 08:36.953
No. We shut this thing down.

08:36.986 --> 08:39.222
I need you out of jail
and I need you alive.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.662
This thing goes up in flames,
I'll lose every lead I have.

08:50.567 --> 08:52.268
I'm listening.

08:52.303 --> 08:56.372
Right now, the cops are figuring out
how to fuck you every which way.

08:57.374 --> 09:00.576
You wanna put 'em on the
defensive, buy some time?

09:01.912 --> 09:05.081
Walk into Oakland PD and offer
your full cooperation. No lawyer.

09:05.115 --> 09:07.650
I'm not going anywhere near that place.
You're out of your fucking mind.

09:07.685 --> 09:11.020
Cooperate from the start and
if they have nothing on you...

09:11.055 --> 09:14.023
Big fucking if. This is Alec
we're talking about.

09:14.058 --> 09:17.894
You cooperate, the DA's gonna think
twice about bringing charges.

09:17.928 --> 09:19.996
The cops turn down the heat.

09:24.635 --> 09:26.636
- Find out what they have.
- I can't...

09:26.670 --> 09:30.606
I'm not going anywhere near that place
until you find out what they have on me.

09:38.849 --> 09:40.283
Hey, Jackie!

09:40.317 --> 09:44.887
Jackie. We're tightening ship.
I need to swap phones. I need the old one.

09:49.760 --> 09:50.960
- Thanks.
- Alright.

09:50.994 --> 09:53.162
Thanks, Charlie.

09:53.664 --> 09:56.265
Where's he taking that?

09:56.300 --> 09:58.701
You collected everyone's
phones? Your whole crew?

09:58.736 --> 10:01.304
- Mm-hm.
- You know what you're sitting on?

10:01.338 --> 10:04.107
- Please don't tell me you destroyed 'em.
- What do you take me for?

10:04.141 --> 10:07.610
I can run them.
Locations. Numbers.

10:07.644 --> 10:11.314
- Those phones could give up your traitor.
- It's not happening.

10:11.348 --> 10:15.151
You may want me free, Grace.
You're still a cop.

10:16.787 --> 10:20.356
- Why would I jeopardize...
- Find out what they have on me.

10:20.391 --> 10:21.924
Do your job.

10:23.694 --> 10:25.762
Yeah.

10:28.065 --> 10:29.465
Yeah.

10:39.977 --> 10:41.978
He has no right
to talk to you like that.

10:42.012 --> 10:44.480
Leave it.

10:45.282 --> 10:48.151
He lets himself in, talks
like that in your own home.

10:48.185 --> 10:49.819
I said leave it.

10:53.123 --> 10:55.391
You don't have to take it.

10:59.430 --> 11:01.664
You're the master here.

11:01.698 --> 11:03.733
Twice the man.

11:08.739 --> 11:12.341
Still... you wanna lie down?

11:14.845 --> 11:17.346
- Roll over?
- Fuck off.

11:19.016 --> 11:21.217
Fuck you, Alec Laszlo.

11:22.619 --> 11:24.020
Fuck you.

12:14.338 --> 12:16.739
Come on, baby. Come on!

12:24.448 --> 12:26.382
Harder!

13:33.350 --> 13:35.585
You're gonna have to
deal with it.

13:37.054 --> 13:39.055
Tie up loose ends.

13:42.559 --> 13:47.229
You need to get those boys out of here
before the cops or the chinks find them.

13:49.366 --> 13:51.434
Put them on a bus.

13:54.171 --> 13:56.272
Baby?

14:10.387 --> 14:12.388
What's going on out there?

14:15.792 --> 14:18.361
I can't lie. It ain't fuckin'
pretty. I'll tell you that.

14:18.395 --> 14:20.496
The 5-0?

14:21.465 --> 14:24.033
Looks like he's gonna
pull through.

14:24.067 --> 14:25.568
Oh, thank fuck.

14:25.602 --> 14:29.005
Look. Don't beat yourselves up.
Who could've known?

14:29.039 --> 14:32.108
Still gotta hang tight, okay?
You can't show your faces.

14:34.177 --> 14:36.545
Brought you some shit.

14:38.215 --> 14:40.316
Keep your strength up.

14:45.589 --> 14:49.692
This uh...
This screw-up was your idea.

14:49.726 --> 14:51.894
You know, we did this for you.

14:51.928 --> 14:54.764
Now we're hiding out here
like a bunch of fucking bums.

14:54.798 --> 14:57.933
- What the fuck are we gonna do?
- I'm looking out for you.

14:59.403 --> 15:02.338
That's what I'm doing.
I owe you. I know that.

15:02.372 --> 15:06.042
Now, I'm getting you out of here, just
for a while, till things settle down.

15:07.477 --> 15:08.844
When?

15:08.879 --> 15:10.780
I'm working on it.

15:12.182 --> 15:15.184
Hopefully, I'll have
something by tonight.

15:16.920 --> 15:19.221
I'm gonna need your phones.

15:19.256 --> 15:21.223
Why?

15:21.258 --> 15:23.392
Don't worry.
I'll get you new burners.

15:23.427 --> 15:26.595
So the fuckin' cops can't locate you.
Why do you think?

15:31.034 --> 15:34.470
I got your back.
We take care of our own.

15:34.504 --> 15:36.539
Now, you hang tough.
You hear me?

15:36.573 --> 15:38.174
Huh?

15:39.209 --> 15:41.977
- Yeah, we're cool.
- Tight.

15:42.012 --> 15:45.214
I'll be back later.
Couple of hours tops.

16:08.939 --> 16:10.372
Hey, baby.

16:10.407 --> 16:12.174
Kim, right?

16:13.443 --> 16:14.877
It's okay.

16:14.911 --> 16:17.113
You a cop?

16:18.115 --> 16:20.182
Go get a coffee.

16:20.217 --> 16:23.085
You tell anyone I'm here,
I'm calling Immigration.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.154
Go on.

17:08.832 --> 17:11.166
Surprise.

17:15.472 --> 17:17.606
Grace Travis.

17:17.641 --> 17:20.742
I've been waiting for this day since
you first walked into Oakland.

17:20.777 --> 17:24.713
- Yeah, me too.
- I see you came prepared.

17:25.949 --> 17:29.318
- So how do you want me? - Not sure
I've got the words to describe it.

17:29.352 --> 17:32.254
- Ooh, sounds exciting.
- Mm-hm.

17:35.759 --> 17:37.293
You been following me?

17:37.327 --> 17:40.329
Oh, come on.
You ran me for ten months.

17:41.331 --> 17:44.600
You didn't think I'd make it my
business to know everything about you?

17:44.634 --> 17:46.769
Every skank CI you put
on the payroll.

17:46.803 --> 17:49.638
Every fleabag motel
you take your meetings in.

17:52.642 --> 17:57.046
I'm thinking Hernandez has gotta have you on
probation after that stunt you pulled with me.

17:57.080 --> 17:59.181
- Technically.
- Technically.

17:59.216 --> 18:01.984
So how's it gonna go down
with Lieutenant Hernandez

18:02.018 --> 18:04.854
when she finds out
you've been nailing your CI?

18:08.291 --> 18:10.259
What do you want?

18:10.293 --> 18:13.162
The look on your face
is almost enough.

18:24.007 --> 18:26.508
What are you saying, Jimmy?
What's your point?

18:26.543 --> 18:29.311
I'm just saying
I need more time.

18:29.346 --> 18:32.348
- How long?
- Couple of days, hopefully.

18:32.382 --> 18:34.984
- Hopefully?
- Nothing to worry about.

18:35.018 --> 18:38.988
The banks are taking longer than I thought
to process the funds. You know how it is.

18:39.022 --> 18:41.690
You don't close this by the end
of the week, Jimmy, the deal's going south.

18:41.725 --> 18:43.893
Is that what you want?

18:43.927 --> 18:46.629
No. Don't worry.
I'll have the money. Hm?

18:46.663 --> 18:48.597
- Okay.
- Listen, Ted, I got another call.

18:48.632 --> 18:50.633
I have to go.

18:57.974 --> 18:59.008
Yeah?

18:59.042 --> 19:00.776
They got nothing on you.

19:00.810 --> 19:03.045
- You're good to go.
- What, that's it?

19:03.079 --> 19:05.481
Unless you've forgotten
the address of Oakland PD.

19:07.317 --> 19:09.485
You're fine, Jimmy.
On my life.

19:10.353 --> 19:12.554
It will be.

20:12.682 --> 20:15.084
Not in there!
Try Charlie's office.

20:31.768 --> 20:33.035
Jacks?

20:33.169 --> 20:37.072
Jimmy wanted me to drop off the
manifest for the Northern Star.

20:37.107 --> 20:39.608
See what we can
squeeze in there.

20:52.689 --> 20:54.723
Hernandez.

20:55.825 --> 20:59.762
Are you kidding me?
Send him up.

21:06.436 --> 21:08.437
It's through here.

21:24.387 --> 21:28.057
I don't think we've met.
James Laszlo.

21:30.060 --> 21:31.460
This way.

21:39.969 --> 21:43.272
Jimmy's phones.
His whole fucking crew.

21:44.174 --> 21:47.743
I need you to run 'em.
Locations, where they've been calling.

21:47.777 --> 21:50.345
- Anything that can give us
anything at all. - Slow down.

21:50.380 --> 21:52.114
No. I need to get 'em back.

21:52.816 --> 21:56.285
Are you kidding me, Travis?
That's a warrant.

21:56.319 --> 21:59.488
There's paperwork. That's
a trail. There's no way.

21:59.522 --> 22:02.691
There's always a way. Come
on. You can figure it out.

22:02.725 --> 22:05.694
No, I can't. Sorry.

22:06.796 --> 22:09.031
You're sorry?

22:10.133 --> 22:13.368
Just think for a moment who the fuck
you're getting into bed with here.

22:13.403 --> 22:16.338
They almost killed a cop
last night. One of us.

22:16.372 --> 22:18.507
One of us?

22:18.541 --> 22:21.543
They kicked me out the
fuckin' door. Right. One of us?

22:21.578 --> 22:24.213
- Grace.
- Seven years old.

22:25.215 --> 22:27.883
I will get into bed with
whoever I fuckin' will have to.

22:27.917 --> 22:29.318
He was seven years old.

22:29.352 --> 22:31.957
You keep going the
way you're going and

22:32.068 --> 22:34.823
everything's gonna happen is
Evie's gonna lose her mother.

22:35.058 --> 22:36.492
This runs deep.

22:36.526 --> 22:39.361
I ran Jimmy's arrests.
You know who had him flagged?

22:39.395 --> 22:41.897
Hm? Hernandez.

22:43.967 --> 22:45.601
- Hernandez?
- Yeah.

22:45.635 --> 22:47.669
She called me up, wanted to
know why I was looking at Laszlo,

22:47.704 --> 22:50.506
told me to run everything
by her.

22:51.307 --> 22:54.243
You're getting in
way over your head here.

22:55.211 --> 22:57.913
- You gotta end this.
- When did you find out?

22:57.947 --> 23:00.249
What?

23:00.283 --> 23:03.085
The flag.
When did you find out?

23:06.923 --> 23:08.757
Couple of days ago.

23:08.791 --> 23:13.061
You've known for two days Hernandez
is running interference for Jimmy

23:13.096 --> 23:15.097
and you didn't think
to tell me?

23:15.131 --> 23:17.599
- I didn't want you...
- What?

23:17.634 --> 23:19.868
I got burned, Mitch!

23:19.903 --> 23:23.505
I had a gun put to my head
and you didn't think to tell me?

23:23.540 --> 23:25.674
Christ! One of us!

23:28.378 --> 23:30.379
What happened to you?

23:49.232 --> 23:53.335
For the record, Mr. Laszlo, you're
here of your own free will?

23:53.369 --> 23:54.803
I am, Lieutenant. Yes.

23:54.837 --> 23:57.639
I heard about last night's
arson attack

23:57.674 --> 24:00.576
at the Bamboo Pearl
on Franklin.

24:01.377 --> 24:04.913
I understand one of your
officers was injured.

24:04.948 --> 24:06.815
- How's he doing?
- He'll make it.

24:06.849 --> 24:08.250
Good. That's good news.

24:08.284 --> 24:11.987
It was a despicable
and cowardly act, Lieutenant.

24:12.755 --> 24:16.291
I'd like to extend my
condolences to their families.

24:16.326 --> 24:18.160
I'm sure they'll be
heartened to hear that.

24:18.194 --> 24:22.064
Which is why I'm here
to offer my full cooperation.

24:22.098 --> 24:25.467
I assume you're aware of
certain business conflicts

24:25.501 --> 24:28.670
my colleagues and I have
with the Lee brothers.

24:28.705 --> 24:33.342
I also assume we would naturally be
of interest in the investigation.

24:34.077 --> 24:35.544
How good is this guy?

24:38.748 --> 24:40.949
And why would that be?

24:40.984 --> 24:43.252
Well, you know as well
as I do, Lieutenant,

24:43.286 --> 24:48.890
that relations between my family,
my businesses and the Oakland PD

24:48.925 --> 24:51.627
have not always been
all that they could.

24:51.661 --> 24:52.894
Relations?

24:52.929 --> 24:55.564
So to avoid any waste of
valuable time on your part,

24:55.598 --> 24:57.466
I'm here to help
in any way I can.

24:57.500 --> 25:00.569
I and my organization
have nothing to hide.

25:00.603 --> 25:04.139
Hopefully this will free you up
to look for the real culprits.

25:05.708 --> 25:08.377
Tell me about your other son,
Alec.

25:08.611 --> 25:11.546
- Alec.
- Got a bit of a temper on him, doesn't he?

25:11.581 --> 25:13.415
Where was he 6:30 last night?

25:13.449 --> 25:17.185
At my house. We were having a
homecoming party for my youngest.

25:17.220 --> 25:20.255
- Max.
- Along with dozens of guests.

25:22.258 --> 25:24.993
Max just came out of
Santa Rita, right?

25:25.027 --> 25:28.063
You must be very proud.

25:28.097 --> 25:32.234
It's not what any decent
person wish for their son, is it?

25:33.035 --> 25:36.338
I've made mistakes as
a parent. I can't deny that.

25:37.106 --> 25:41.676
I suppose every parent has, but it
doesn't make it any easier, does it?

25:42.778 --> 25:45.247
Do you have children,
Lieutenant?

25:48.885 --> 25:50.252
Mm.

25:50.286 --> 25:53.788
I'm happy to bring Alec down
here to answer any questions,

25:53.823 --> 25:56.057
without counsel,
if that's what you'd like.

25:56.092 --> 25:57.659
- You speaking for him?
- No. No.

25:57.693 --> 26:01.029
I'm simply saying he too is willing
to help in any way he can.

26:01.063 --> 26:03.999
Oh. You grown a conscience
all of a sudden?

26:04.033 --> 26:08.370
Well, how am I supposed
to answer that, Lieutenant?

26:10.940 --> 26:13.308
I fuckin' love this guy, man.

26:14.343 --> 26:16.111
Let's talk about your business.

26:16.145 --> 26:19.214
- By all means.
- It's been quite a couple of weeks.

26:19.248 --> 26:20.715
That's one way of putting it.

26:20.750 --> 26:23.184
Your accountant turns out dead.
Somebody takes a shot at you.

26:23.219 --> 26:25.420
- Allegedly.
- How's your crew feeling?

26:25.454 --> 26:28.056
- My business colleagues?
- Shaken, I'll bet.

26:28.090 --> 26:29.624
Feeling like they're under siege.

26:29.659 --> 26:32.494
Losing a little faith
in the leadership.

26:33.329 --> 26:36.097
That's gotta hurt.

26:36.132 --> 26:39.401
You don't have what it takes anymore.
Is that what they're saying?

26:39.435 --> 26:41.603
I wouldn't know.

26:41.637 --> 26:46.408
They're certainly gonna miss Tony Aldon.
I know that. He was a good man.

26:46.442 --> 26:50.946
Come on. You gotta be aching to
hit back, shore up your position.

26:50.980 --> 26:54.082
You can't be perceived
as weak, not in your game.

26:54.116 --> 26:56.284
Then the vultures really
start circling.

26:56.319 --> 26:59.588
I'm putting my faith in you
and the Oakland PD

26:59.622 --> 27:02.057
to solve Tony's murder,

27:02.091 --> 27:05.694
and to keep us safe
in the future, Lieutenant.

27:07.196 --> 27:10.131
I have every confidence
you'll do that.

27:14.804 --> 27:18.840
Fucking dancing round her.
Raid him.

27:25.514 --> 27:28.416
- Just got static.
- We got static!

27:28.451 --> 27:30.318
- Shit!
- Offices clean?

27:30.353 --> 27:32.787
- Yeah. How long do you want
us to hold 'em off? - Give me a minute.

27:32.822 --> 27:35.890
Do not let 'em
break down that door.

27:37.860 --> 27:40.362
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

27:42.398 --> 27:44.399
Open up!

27:44.433 --> 27:46.301
Oakland PD.

27:46.335 --> 27:49.004
- Hold on. I'm coming.
- Open up! Police!

27:49.038 --> 27:50.939
Open the goddamn door!

27:50.973 --> 27:53.642
Okay. You know, the stress is gonna
get you, you know that?

27:53.676 --> 27:55.276
Try some fucking deep breathing.

27:55.311 --> 27:57.379
I lost the keys.

27:58.748 --> 28:01.516
- Okay, go! Go!
- Okay, okay!

28:02.418 --> 28:04.386
One second. Hold on.

28:04.420 --> 28:06.454
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Hey!

28:06.489 --> 28:07.656
Go, go, go!

28:17.466 --> 28:19.067
Let's go!

28:19.902 --> 28:21.036
Clear.

28:29.045 --> 28:30.645
You did your best.

28:30.680 --> 28:33.648
The balls on that guy.
You kinda gotta admire him.

28:33.683 --> 28:35.116
Why don't you buy him a drink?

28:35.151 --> 28:37.452
Better still,
get his autograph--

28:37.486 --> 28:40.288
on a charge sheet, preferably.

28:40.322 --> 28:42.724
You didn't land
a single punch, Lieutenant.

28:47.263 --> 28:49.597
I want whoever's responsible
for this.

28:49.632 --> 28:52.267
I want their fucking heads.

28:56.539 --> 28:58.907
Thank you.

28:58.941 --> 29:01.409
You're not gonna like this.
The place is a fucking mess.

29:01.444 --> 29:03.511
The fuckers.

29:10.619 --> 29:13.488
Next time, Lloyd,
just open the door. Mm?

29:15.691 --> 29:17.726
It's always a mess.

29:17.727 --> 29:18.727
Fuck.

29:19.528 --> 29:20.895
Jesus.

29:20.930 --> 29:23.264
- Smart move.
- What?

29:23.299 --> 29:26.534
The phones. Clearing
them out. Smart move.

29:27.336 --> 29:29.337
Yeah.

29:49.325 --> 29:51.726
- Hi.
- You fuckin' steal from me?!

29:51.761 --> 29:53.995
- Jimmy...
- From me?

29:54.029 --> 29:56.669
You send me down there
and I get fucking raided.

29:56.770 --> 29:58.767
Who do you think
you're dealing with?

29:57.800 --> 29:59.801
What raid?
I didn't know anything...

29:59.835 --> 30:02.704
You get them back.
You fucking get them back now!

30:02.738 --> 30:04.439
Don't make me
come looking for you!

30:04.473 --> 30:06.107
Please...

30:07.309 --> 30:09.544
Fuck.

30:21.590 --> 30:24.159
- Yeah?
- You got anything?

30:24.193 --> 30:25.794
No, not yet.

30:27.096 --> 30:29.230
- Then when?
- I'm on it, Grace.

30:29.265 --> 30:30.632
When?

30:30.866 --> 30:33.768
I'm about to work something
right now. I'm on it. I'll call you later.

30:33.803 --> 30:36.404
Jimmy found out
I took the phones.

30:38.507 --> 30:41.809
You stole them from him?
Oh, Jesus.

30:41.844 --> 30:43.845
Yeah. Right. So I gotta
get them back.

30:43.879 --> 30:47.415
Grace, I'm on it. I'll call you
when I'm done. Alright?

30:50.052 --> 30:52.553
s & t Telecom.
How may I direct your call?

30:53.655 --> 30:55.823
Putting you through.
Thank you.

30:59.395 --> 31:01.029
- Hello.
- Hello.

31:01.063 --> 31:05.099
Detective Lucas Mitchell, looking
for a Carson Blakemore, please.

31:06.635 --> 31:09.070
There's a police officer
here to see you.

31:10.472 --> 31:12.540
Detective Mitchell.

31:14.610 --> 31:17.345
- He'll be out momentarily.
- Thank you very much.

31:24.553 --> 31:26.421
s & t Telecom.

31:26.455 --> 31:28.990
How may I direct your call?
Thank you.

31:31.326 --> 31:33.294
Officer? How can I help?

31:33.328 --> 31:35.029
It's "Detective".

31:35.064 --> 31:37.932
- Detective. Sorry.
- Don't be.

31:37.966 --> 31:40.935
Don't know why you'd want
to remember. I sure as hell wouldn't.

31:40.969 --> 31:44.505
3rd and King. 29th July.
Year before last.

31:44.540 --> 31:46.741
Um... no...

31:47.576 --> 31:49.977
The er... Heartbreak Hotel.

31:50.012 --> 31:52.113
Oh, come on.

31:52.147 --> 31:54.949
On the East Side.
Rents by the hour.

31:55.784 --> 31:58.286
- I was working vice.
- Yes, of course.

31:58.320 --> 32:00.354
Detective Mitchell...

32:01.123 --> 32:03.191
Maybe we should take this
into my office.

32:03.192 --> 32:04.192
Right.

32:06.095 --> 32:08.696
This whole thing's
a clusterfuck.

32:09.765 --> 32:13.401
We cannot afford to let it spiral
out of control any further.

32:13.435 --> 32:14.969
We need to contain it.

32:15.003 --> 32:18.339
No-one makes a move
without my say so.

32:19.975 --> 32:22.877
- Am I making myself clear?
- Yeah, boss.

32:22.911 --> 32:25.079
- We got it, boss.
- Yeah, yeah.

32:27.282 --> 32:30.551
- Where are they?
- They've set up at the Szechuan Buddha.

32:30.586 --> 32:33.321
It's another of their joints
over on Vesey.

32:33.355 --> 32:36.491
- Shit. How many have they got?
- This one's all-you-can-eat.

32:36.525 --> 32:39.694
Fuckers are vicious. Rice
fermenting on the buffet all day.

32:39.728 --> 32:42.196
I'm telling you,
you're paying to puke.

32:42.231 --> 32:44.565
Are we done?

32:44.600 --> 32:46.634
Hold up.

32:47.469 --> 32:48.936
Let him in.

32:54.443 --> 32:55.843
Come on.

32:59.615 --> 33:01.082
So what do you wanna do?

33:01.116 --> 33:05.720
I'm gonna go over there, I'm gonna sit down,
work this thing out with them face to face.

33:06.889 --> 33:09.290
- Something you want to say?
- Just...

33:10.726 --> 33:12.143
Is that a good idea?

33:12.265 --> 33:15.229
I mean, you walk in that joint,
who knows how they're gonna react?

33:14.263 --> 33:17.198
- I can handle it.
- I'm not questioning that.

33:17.232 --> 33:19.567
It's...

33:19.601 --> 33:22.136
Do you want to pour water
on this thing?

33:22.171 --> 33:24.038
Because that's pouring oil
on it.

33:24.072 --> 33:26.073
It's like a red rag to a bull.

33:26.108 --> 33:28.809
He's right. These chinks
are fucking unpredictable.

33:28.844 --> 33:30.845
You can't exactly
read their faces.

33:33.815 --> 33:35.816
I'll go.

33:39.421 --> 33:41.522
- Forget it.
- You haven't thought about it.

33:41.557 --> 33:43.424
- I don't need to.
- Why not?

33:43.458 --> 33:47.161
Because it's not happening.
I'm not letting you walk in there.

33:48.030 --> 33:50.231
They don't know me, Dad.
I've been away.

33:51.133 --> 33:53.801
I don't carry any baggage
with them.

33:53.835 --> 33:56.771
But I'm your son. Which shows
we're taking it seriously.

33:56.805 --> 33:58.239
It shows respect.

34:01.543 --> 34:03.144
And I'll keep a cool head.

34:04.079 --> 34:06.714
Which is what we all need
right now.

34:06.748 --> 34:09.784
Maybe with hindsight, if
we'd had that previously...

34:09.818 --> 34:11.786
Kid's got a point, Jimmy.

34:11.820 --> 34:13.387
I don't like it.

34:14.623 --> 34:16.791
I'll go with him.
I'll watch his back.

34:16.824 --> 34:19.960
We'll put Sean at guard by
the door. He won't be alone.

34:23.532 --> 34:24.899
I want to help.

34:24.933 --> 34:27.435
You need to contain
this thing fast, and...

34:29.137 --> 34:31.138
I can do it.

35:05.841 --> 35:09.377
- Do we have anything?
- I'm just getting started.

35:09.411 --> 35:12.480
- Are you safe?
- Yeah.

35:13.115 --> 35:15.283
How long before
you'll have something?

35:15.317 --> 35:18.419
I don't know, but the more you keep
bugging me, the longer it's gonna take.

35:18.453 --> 35:19.954
Well, call me
as soon as you do.

35:19.988 --> 35:21.656
- All right?
- Okay.

35:21.690 --> 35:23.991
At the moment
you get something, Mitch.

35:24.026 --> 35:25.493
Goodbye, Travis.

35:29.631 --> 35:31.766
Oh! God.

35:32.401 --> 35:34.535
You scared me.

35:34.569 --> 35:37.004
How long you been
standing there?

35:37.039 --> 35:39.240
Well, come on.
Come on, sit down.

35:39.274 --> 35:42.677
I went ahead
and did it without you.

35:42.711 --> 35:44.612
Ziggy's lasagna.

35:44.646 --> 35:47.415
A little late, I know,
but here it is.

35:48.650 --> 35:49.984
Huh?

35:50.018 --> 35:52.687
So what do you think?
You hungry?

35:54.389 --> 35:56.724
Come on. Evie, sit down.

35:56.758 --> 35:59.026
Tell me about your day.
Something.

36:00.028 --> 36:02.029
I had lasagna for lunch.

36:30.625 --> 36:34.261
- This is too fucking long.
- I could go in and I...

36:34.296 --> 36:36.664
No, you stay where you are.

36:38.467 --> 36:40.835
If they hurt him...

36:42.070 --> 36:44.638
- Max could talk his way out of a...
- Shut up!

36:52.814 --> 36:55.316
Oh, come on, come on.

36:57.452 --> 36:59.053
They're coming.

37:15.237 --> 37:17.405
They want blood.

37:21.877 --> 37:24.011
But I negotiated.

37:25.213 --> 37:27.081
It wasn't easy.

37:27.115 --> 37:29.417
They're stubborn
little fuckers.

37:31.286 --> 37:34.955
Well, they started at 1.2
but they'll settle at 750.

37:40.362 --> 37:41.429
Dad?

37:42.764 --> 37:44.765
I can't do that.

37:46.034 --> 37:47.501
Not right now.

37:52.274 --> 37:54.642
What do you mean?
It's a lotta money, sure.

37:54.676 --> 37:57.278
- But we can get hands on it.
- Not now. No.

38:01.082 --> 38:04.018
Then... it's blood.

38:33.181 --> 38:35.349
How's she doing?

38:38.320 --> 38:42.189
You know... you can go
up there and talk to her.

38:42.924 --> 38:44.625
She doesn't want me.

38:44.659 --> 38:46.694
Doesn't want you?

38:47.996 --> 38:51.265
I thought you were supposed
to be the adult here.

38:51.299 --> 38:52.833
What does that mean?

38:52.868 --> 38:55.469
- Don't, Grace. Not now.
- No, no, really.

38:55.504 --> 38:58.372
I want to hear this.
What does that mean?

38:58.406 --> 39:00.574
You really wanna do this
right now?

39:00.609 --> 39:02.843
I really wanna do this
right now.

39:02.878 --> 39:04.912
Okay. Okay, fine.

39:06.047 --> 39:09.216
She wants consistency, Grace.

39:09.251 --> 39:13.787
She wants somebody who'll be there for her,
not somebody who's always running away.

39:13.822 --> 39:15.856
I'm running away?

39:15.891 --> 39:19.960
I'm the one out there
with the fear and the filth.

39:19.995 --> 39:21.595
That is your choice.

39:22.564 --> 39:25.599
Sometimes I think I'm the only
one facing up to this thing,

39:25.634 --> 39:28.369
cos I am sure as shit
the only one dealing with it.

39:28.403 --> 39:32.139
Right. Right. Because your grief
is just so much more profound than mine.

39:32.173 --> 39:35.009
- I am fighting for my son!
- Our son!

39:35.043 --> 39:38.779
Our son! He's my boy, too!

39:40.048 --> 39:42.049
He was...

39:43.618 --> 39:45.652
You know what? You do not
have a monopoly on pain.

39:46.554 --> 39:48.222
Every day,
I wanna curl up and die.

39:48.256 --> 39:51.558
But I don't. I'm right here.
I'm not running.

39:51.593 --> 39:53.826
Because our daughter has
been through more hurt

39:53.921 --> 39:56.597
than any kid her age
should have to deal with.

39:56.630 --> 39:57.831
So I stay here
because she needs me.

39:58.633 --> 40:01.602
- She needs a mother, too.
- "A mother".

40:01.636 --> 40:04.538
Her mother, Grace! Okay?
She needs you. Okay?

40:04.572 --> 40:06.473
How fuckin' dare you.

40:06.508 --> 40:09.376
You run.
You know, you stay busy.

40:09.410 --> 40:11.612
You lose yourself so you
don't have to stay here

40:11.646 --> 40:15.349
and deal with the reality of
a decimated fucking family.

40:16.351 --> 40:18.552
You run. Okay?

40:19.454 --> 40:21.922
Out there, away from me.

40:21.956 --> 40:23.724
Away from us.

40:25.293 --> 40:27.294
I...

40:28.329 --> 40:30.864
I can't reach you anymore.

40:32.567 --> 40:36.370
And that is killing me.
That is fucking killing me.

40:41.142 --> 40:43.777
Our son is dead.

40:45.780 --> 40:47.981
He's gone, Grace.

40:48.817 --> 40:51.752
And it's mean
and it's miserable...

40:51.786 --> 40:55.088
and it's unfair and it doesn't
make any fuckin' sense.

40:55.123 --> 40:57.090
- Stop it. Stop it!
- It is never...

40:57.125 --> 40:59.593
- Listen to what I have to say!
- Stop it! Stop it!

40:59.627 --> 41:01.361
It's never gonna get
any better.

41:01.396 --> 41:04.264
And if you think fucking justice
and vengeance is gonna help,

41:04.299 --> 41:08.535
then you are fuckin' misguided
and you are fuckin' lost.

41:08.570 --> 41:10.237
You hear that, Grace?

41:10.271 --> 41:13.307
You're fuckin' lost
and I don't know what to do.

41:14.075 --> 41:16.210
Like I fuckin' just don't know
what to do.

41:19.647 --> 41:21.648
Tom...

41:24.085 --> 41:25.686
- Tom, please...
- Grace...

41:25.720 --> 41:29.022
I can't do this anymore.
Fighting.

41:29.057 --> 41:31.058
I don't wanna do this.

41:31.092 --> 41:33.760
This fighting.
This back and forth.

41:34.762 --> 41:37.297
I'm too tired.
I got nothing left.

41:39.667 --> 41:41.735
Yeah, well, fuck you.

41:42.704 --> 41:45.572
Yeah. Yeah, fuck you, too.

42:33.121 --> 42:34.688
How's it hangin'?

42:35.890 --> 42:37.891
Any news or what?

42:38.826 --> 42:40.460
I'm gettin' you out of here.

42:41.462 --> 42:43.463
- When?
- Now.

42:47.268 --> 42:48.635
Where? Where are we going?

42:48.670 --> 42:50.671
Wanna know where we're
sending your asses?

42:50.705 --> 42:52.039
Yeah.

42:53.274 --> 42:55.309
Fuck.

42:55.343 --> 42:58.478
Almost forgot.
Dead Presidents.

42:59.247 --> 43:01.548
Keep you going
till I bring you back.

43:06.854 --> 43:08.221
So...

43:08.256 --> 43:11.391
Ensenada, Mexico.

43:12.794 --> 43:16.296
Fun in the sun.
Steaks by the pool.

43:16.331 --> 43:19.066
Meet the locals.
Eat their pussy.

43:19.100 --> 43:21.935
Freshly prepared, organic,
for all I know.

43:22.770 --> 43:24.438
Fuck.

43:24.472 --> 43:26.473
Organic pussy.

43:26.507 --> 43:28.909
You two are gonna
live like kings.

43:31.512 --> 43:33.580
Your phones.

43:33.614 --> 43:36.650
Hey. You did good.

43:36.684 --> 43:39.252
You came through for me.

43:39.287 --> 43:42.022
- I'm not gonna forget it.
- Thanks, chief.

43:42.924 --> 43:45.425
When all this shit
blows over...

43:45.460 --> 43:48.161
we are gonna
fuckin' rock this town.

43:48.196 --> 43:50.330
Ain't gonna know what hit it.

43:50.365 --> 43:51.898
Am I right?

43:51.933 --> 43:54.167
- Am I right?
- Fuckin' A, man.

43:54.202 --> 43:56.269
Fuckin' A.

43:58.006 --> 44:00.007
Let's go.

44:15.957 --> 44:19.292
Hey. Oh. You didn't have to.

44:19.327 --> 44:22.329
- We got anything?
- No. Come on in.

44:26.434 --> 44:29.036
- Something to drink?
- No.

44:30.538 --> 44:33.373
Mm. You hungry?

44:33.408 --> 44:35.409
Uh-uh. No.

44:35.443 --> 44:38.612
Oh... this looks good.

44:41.416 --> 44:44.351
I'm just trying to
make sense of it all.

44:45.053 --> 44:47.254
Red is for Jimmy.

44:48.056 --> 44:50.357
Blue's Charlie.
Green is Lloyd.

45:02.370 --> 45:05.439
None of them show up
near Sam's school.

45:05.473 --> 45:07.607
Oh. Sorry.

45:08.476 --> 45:10.644
Sure you're not hungry?

47:08.062 --> 47:10.130
We're done.

48:01.549 --> 48:02.882
What?

48:11.859 --> 48:13.860
Mitch?

48:14.996 --> 48:16.429
We got something.
