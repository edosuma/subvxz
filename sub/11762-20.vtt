WEBVTT

00:02.173 --> 00:04.775
(door opens and closes)
(Harry Chapin) в™Є HE'D SAY,
"I'M GONNA BE LIKE YOU, DAD в™Є

00:04.775 --> 00:07.378
HEY, GUYS, WHAT'S GOING ON?
SHH!

00:07.378 --> 00:09.380
THE GUYS ARE PLAYING
EMOTIONAL CHICKEN.

00:09.380 --> 00:12.183
WHOEVER CRIES TO THIS SONG FIRST
LOSES.

00:12.183 --> 00:13.244
MM.

00:13.244 --> 00:15.246
I'VE GOT 20 BUCKS ON BOBBY.

00:15.246 --> 00:17.148
LISTEN TO THE WORDS.

00:17.148 --> 00:20.751
THIS DAD HAD NO TIME
FOR HIS BOY.

00:20.751 --> 00:22.653
SOUND FAMILIAR?

00:22.653 --> 00:24.024
(coos)

00:24.024 --> 00:26.026
TRAVIS IS A MAN NOW.

00:26.026 --> 00:29.130
HIS CHILDHOOD'S GONE,
AND YOU MISSED IT.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.432
YOU WORK SO MUCH.

00:31.432 --> 00:35.736
STAN USED TO CRY WHEN YOU LEFT,
BUT NOW HE DOESN'T.

00:35.736 --> 00:38.409
YOUR SON GREW UP WITHOUT YOU.

00:38.409 --> 00:40.411
YOUR SON IS...
(whispers) FORGETTING YOU.

00:40.411 --> 00:43.114
в™Є I SAID, "NOT TODAY,
I GOT A LOT TO DO" в™Є

00:43.114 --> 00:45.116
в™Є HE SAID, "THAT'S OKAY" в™Є

00:45.116 --> 00:46.647
(sobbing)
I'M SO SORRY, STAN!

00:46.647 --> 00:48.319
в™Є HIS SMILE NEVER DIMMED
AND SAID... в™Є

00:48.319 --> 00:51.051
OH, BOBBY,
YOU GOT CHANGE FOR A $20?

00:51.051 --> 00:54.085
(grunts)
I WOULD SO ROCK
AT THIS GAME.

00:54.085 --> 00:56.757
IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK.
YOU HAVE TO HOLD EYE CONTACT.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.759
I ALWAYS HOLD EYE CONTACT
WITH PEOPLE.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.761
IT TOTALLY FREAKS OUT
MY GYNO.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.833
(sighs) HEY.

01:02.833 --> 01:05.236
TRAV! LET'S GO PLAY CATCH.

01:05.236 --> 01:06.437
I'M GOOD.

01:06.437 --> 01:08.439
LOOK AT MY FACE.
NEVER FORGET ME.

01:08.439 --> 01:10.741
HE WON'T LOOK AT ME!
HE WON'T LOOK AT ME!

01:10.741 --> 01:12.743
HE WON'T LOOK AT ME!

01:12.743 --> 01:15.176
OH, EVERYBODY'S ACTING WEIRD.

01:15.176 --> 01:19.110
I DON'T THINK BABY STAN LOOKS
VERY MUCH LIKE YOU AT ALL.
REALLY?

01:19.110 --> 01:21.612
SOMETIMES THE TRAITS THAT
FATHERS PASS ON TO THEIR SONS

01:21.612 --> 01:23.754
ARE MORE SUBTLE.
FOR INSTANCE, BOBBY AND TRAVIS--

01:23.754 --> 01:26.487
THEY SHARE THE SAME SKIN TONE
WHEN BOBBY IS SICK.

01:26.487 --> 01:29.560
CAN WE JUST PRETEND
I'M NOT HERE, PLEASE?

01:29.560 --> 01:32.193
NO. I'M DONE DOING THAT.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.494
YOU ALL RIGHT?

01:35.196 --> 01:40.201
KYLIE DUMPED ME, OKAY?
HAPPY?

01:40.201 --> 01:43.404
OH,
TRAVIS IS SO HEARTBROKEN.

01:43.404 --> 01:46.737
BUT GUESS WHO GETS TO FIX HIM.
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
SAY "YOU."

01:46.737 --> 01:49.140
I CAN WAIT ALL DAY, SO...

01:49.140 --> 01:50.841
MMM.

01:50.841 --> 01:52.883
AHH.

01:52.883 --> 01:55.115
YOU?

01:55.115 --> 01:57.848
ME!
ELLIE, IT WAS SO SAD.

01:57.848 --> 01:59.850
LAST NIGHT, HE PUT HIS HEAD
ON MY SHOULDER,

01:59.850 --> 02:01.352
AND HE JUST CRIED.

02:01.352 --> 02:03.554
ONE LITTLE TEAR
LANDED RIGHT THERE.

02:03.554 --> 02:05.856
THAT'S NOT FROM THE TEAR.

02:05.856 --> 02:09.760
IT'S 'CAUSE I JUST KEEP
TASTING IT ALL DAY. MMM. OHH!

02:09.760 --> 02:13.404
WOW! I... WOW.

02:13.404 --> 02:15.866
THIS CABERNET IS MONKEY PEE,
BUT I'LL TAKE A CASE,

02:15.866 --> 02:17.738
BUT ONLY
'CAUSE YOU SLEEP WITH ME.

02:17.738 --> 02:21.712
THAT'S HOW I SELL
MOST OF THIS STUFF.
I HAVE TO SAY,

02:21.712 --> 02:25.176
WE THINK IT IS SO SEXY
THAT YOU'RE A WINE VENDOR.

02:25.176 --> 02:27.178
I HAVEN'T BLUSHED LIKE THIS

02:27.178 --> 02:29.320
SINCE WE MET
THAT OTHER WINE VENDOR.

02:29.320 --> 02:31.352
COME FOR DINNER TONIGHT.
I CAN'T COOK,

02:31.352 --> 02:33.584
BUT I'LL BRING
TONS OF FREE WINE.
MARRY ME.

02:33.584 --> 02:35.226
JULES?
STOP IT!

02:35.226 --> 02:39.690
OH, I'M SORRY. I CAN'T TONIGHT.
I HAVE TO COMFORT MY SON.

02:39.690 --> 02:42.263
HEY, ANDY AND ELLIE
ARE COMING FOR DINNER TONIGHT.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.534
HOORAY.

02:43.534 --> 02:47.238
SHH!

02:47.238 --> 02:51.502
HE'S GOTTA HAVE AT LEAST
ONE FEATURE THAT LOOKS LIKE ME.

02:55.206 --> 02:56.207
(giggles)

02:58.779 --> 03:01.412
AH, NOPE.

03:01.412 --> 03:04.255
SOMETIMES KIDS LOOK LIKE
OTHER RELATIVES.

03:04.255 --> 03:06.257
FOR INSTANCE,
I LOOK EXACTLY LIKE

03:06.257 --> 03:07.758
MY BIOLOGICAL DAD'S
HANDSOME BROTHER

03:07.758 --> 03:10.721
WHO LIVED WITH US UNTIL MY MOM
GOT PREGNANT WITH ME

03:10.721 --> 03:12.823
AND THEN MY DAD MADE HIM
MOVE OUT.

03:12.823 --> 03:14.825
I'VE GIVEN MY SON NOTHING.
UGH.

03:14.825 --> 03:17.898
WHEN I'M THIS DEPRESSED,
I-I NEED TO EAT.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.331
YOU CAN SOMETIMES GET
FREE CHICKEN IN THIS PARK.

03:20.331 --> 03:22.503
WHERE?
PETTING ZOO.

03:22.503 --> 03:23.974
DUDE, NO.

03:23.974 --> 03:26.907
IT'S LIKE TAKING THE SHAMPOOS
FROM A HOTEL.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.909
THEY EXPECT YOU TO DO IT.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.642
(laughs) THEY REALLY DON'T.

03:31.642 --> 03:33.244
(panting)

03:33.244 --> 03:37.948
(voice breaking) I HOPE
I'M NOT BRINGING YOU DOWN.

03:37.948 --> 03:40.651
LISTEN, I KNOW THAT
YOU HATE WOMEN RIGHT NOW.

03:40.651 --> 03:41.922
(sighs)

03:41.922 --> 03:43.924
BUT WHEN YOU GO OFF
TO COLLEGE,

03:43.924 --> 03:46.927
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
YOU WILL NEVER HAVE TO WORRY

03:46.927 --> 03:48.929
ABOUT A DATE
ON FRIDAY NIGHT,

03:48.929 --> 03:50.931
BECAUSE YOU WILL ALWAYS
HAVE ONE, HONEY.

03:50.931 --> 03:53.964
DO YOU KNOW KNOW WHO?

03:53.964 --> 03:55.806
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
SAY "YOU."

03:57.838 --> 03:59.670
(strangled voice) YOU?
(giggles) ME!

03:59.670 --> 04:02.242
(whimpers)
IF YOU GO TO COLLEGE
WITHIN SIX HOURS,

04:02.242 --> 04:04.515
I'M GONNA DRIVE THERE.
AND IF YOU DON'T,

04:04.515 --> 04:06.517
THEN WE CAN RENT
THE SAME MOVIE

04:06.517 --> 04:09.350
AND WATCH IT WHILE
WE'RE ON THE PHONE.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.951
(door closes)
SOUNDS HORRIFYING.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.953
DON'T MIND ME.
I'M JUST MAKING DINNER.

04:12.953 --> 04:16.487
I NEED TO BORROW A SPATULA.

04:16.487 --> 04:18.429
HEY, TRAV. CHIN UP.

04:18.429 --> 04:22.032
CHICKS REALLY DIG
THE WHOLE SAD, WOUNDED THING.
THANKS.

04:22.032 --> 04:24.535
AW, THAT'S SO SWEET OF YOU
TO CHEER HIM UP.

04:24.535 --> 04:25.696
(whack)

04:25.696 --> 04:27.698
(lowered voice)
DUDE, STOP IT!

04:27.698 --> 04:28.999
I NEED THIS.

04:28.999 --> 04:30.701
THAT REALLY HURT.

04:30.701 --> 04:32.373
SORRY.
DO IT AGAIN.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.374
(whack)

04:33.374 --> 04:35.546
GET OUT. GO.

04:35.546 --> 04:36.707
AHH.

04:36.707 --> 04:38.048
GREAT MEAL, BABY.

04:38.048 --> 04:40.751
I CONCUR. SO, SARA,
DID YOU NOT EAT DESSERT

04:40.751 --> 04:43.283
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT
WEIRD BODY ISSUES?

04:43.283 --> 04:43.914
(imitates explosion)

04:43.914 --> 04:45.616
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

04:45.616 --> 04:47.618
(sighs) WHEN ANDY HAS
SOME DRINKS,

04:47.618 --> 04:49.690
HE LIKES TO ASK
THESE DICEY QUESTIONS.

04:49.690 --> 04:52.923
HE CALLS THEM "QUESTION BOMBS,"
AND HE'S GONNA STOP RIGHT NOW.
FIRE IN THE HOLE.

04:52.923 --> 04:54.925
SO DO YOU ENJOY
INTERCOURSE WITH SARA

04:54.925 --> 04:56.927
EVEN THOUGH YOU ONCE SAID

04:56.927 --> 05:00.731
THAT HAVING SEX WITH SOMEONE
OVER 25 IS REALLY DISGUSTING?
(imitates explosion)

05:00.731 --> 05:02.773
I DIDN'T... (chuckles)
DID NOT--

05:02.773 --> 05:04.575
YOU'RE NOT DISGUSTING.

05:04.575 --> 05:07.508
THANK YOU. CAN I COME OVER THERE
AND MAKE THAT SOUND WITH YOU?

05:07.508 --> 05:10.080
SURE. ANDY, RAPID-FIRE.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.683
HAVE YOU EVER GOTTEN
A GIRL PREGNANT?
(both imitate explosion)

05:12.683 --> 05:15.416
HOW COME YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY BLACK FRIENDS?
(both imitate explosion)

05:15.416 --> 05:17.918
ARE YOU WORRIED THAT
SARA'S GONNA FEEL INSECURE

05:17.918 --> 05:20.090
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO TIGHT
AND FLIRTY WITH JULES?
KABOOM.

05:20.090 --> 05:23.954
JULES AND I ARE JUST FRIENDS,
I PROMISE.

05:23.954 --> 05:25.956
NO MORE OF THIS STUPID GAME.

05:25.956 --> 05:27.658
I WOULDN'T SWEAT IT.

05:27.658 --> 05:29.800
(snoring)

05:29.800 --> 05:31.862
WHEN DID HE UNDO HIS PANTS?

05:31.862 --> 05:34.705
HUH? (mutters)

05:34.705 --> 05:37.538
CUTE FOR AN UGLY PERSON.
UGLY FOR A CUTE PERSON.

05:37.538 --> 05:40.010
HOT IN IRELAND.

05:40.010 --> 05:43.013
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
THE RULES OF THIS GAME.
(gasps) JULES.

05:43.013 --> 05:45.776
ISN'T THAT
TRAVIS' EX-GIRLFRIEND?

05:45.776 --> 05:47.778
LITTLE WHORE
IN HER PINK CARDIGAN.

05:47.778 --> 05:49.980
BACK ME UP, LAURIE.
YEAH.

05:49.980 --> 05:55.456
I BET SHE... PLAYS TENNIS
AND WRITES THANK YOU NOTES.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.988
WHAT? THIS ONE'S HARD.
SHE'S SO CUTE.

05:57.988 --> 06:01.392
SHE CAN'T JUST BREAK MY SON'S
HEART AND THEN HAVE COFFEE.

06:01.392 --> 06:03.694
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO HER.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. JULES.

06:03.694 --> 06:05.696
AS MY UNCLE DAD
ALWAYS TOLD ME,

06:05.696 --> 06:09.099
CHECK YOURSELF
BEFORE YOU WRECK YOURSELF.

06:09.099 --> 06:11.542
YOU DON'T WANNA DO THIS.

06:11.542 --> 06:13.974
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT...
FOR SOMEONE WHO'S WRONG.

06:13.974 --> 06:17.047
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
HEY, KYLIE.

06:17.047 --> 06:20.080
HI. WHAT YOU GOT THERE?
LITTLE PEPPERMINT LATTE?

06:20.080 --> 06:22.082
LAURIE, THROW THIS OUT.
NO.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.715
YEAH. THAT JUST HAPPENED.

06:24.715 --> 06:27.017
YOU THINK YOU CAN GO AROUND
HURTING WHOEVER YOU WANT,

06:27.017 --> 06:29.019
BUT WHEN THERE'S
A MAMA BEAR AROUND,

06:29.019 --> 06:31.462
YOU BETTER WATCH OUT,
BECAUSE SHE MIGHT JUST

06:31.462 --> 06:33.924
RIP YOUR FACE RIGHT OFF
AND MAKE YOU TAKE

06:33.924 --> 06:37.468
A LONG, HARD LOOK AT YOURSELF.
COME ON. LOOK AT IT!

06:37.468 --> 06:41.632
I LOVE TRAVIS. I BROKE UP WITH
HIM BECAUSE HE CHEATED ON ME.

06:41.632 --> 06:43.634
(gasps)

06:43.634 --> 06:45.175
WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP ME?

06:45.175 --> 06:47.638
PUT IT DOWN, JULES.
PUT THE FACE DOWN.

06:51.642 --> 06:57.948
в™Єв™Є

07:04.054 --> 07:06.497
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
TRAVIS IS A CHEATER.

07:06.497 --> 07:08.999
HE MUST HAVE INHERITED
THE CHEATER GENE FROM BOBBY.

07:08.999 --> 07:11.001
WHAT DID TRAVIS EVEN DO?

07:11.001 --> 07:12.933
CHEATING IS KIND OF
HARD TO DEFINE.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.435
NOT TO ME. CHEATING INCLUDES
BUT IS NOT LIMITED

07:15.435 --> 07:18.008
TO SEX, HUGGING, KISSING
AND WINKING.

07:18.008 --> 07:20.010
GRAY AREAS ARE
MOUTH-TO-MOUTH RESUSCITATION,

07:20.010 --> 07:22.172
HOLDING THE ELEVATOR
AND DREAMS,

07:22.172 --> 07:25.115
WHICH YOU CAN CONTROL.
ANDY, PUNISHMENT FOR CHEATING?

07:25.115 --> 07:28.719
REMOVING MY OWN GENITALIA WITH
GARDEN SHEARS WHILE YOU WATCH.

07:28.719 --> 07:29.780
WOW.

07:29.780 --> 07:31.782
I DON'T THINK IT'S CHEATING

07:31.782 --> 07:34.154
IF YOU'RE ON VACATION,
IF IT'S OUT OF PITY

07:34.154 --> 07:36.857
OR IF YOU BOTH KEEP
YOUR TOPS ON.
SO MANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT.

07:36.857 --> 07:39.129
I JUST CAN'T LET TRAVIS
TURN INTO HIS DAD.

07:39.129 --> 07:42.092
I MEAN, I'M GONNA HAVE TO
BITCH-SLAP SOME SENSE INTO HIM.

07:42.092 --> 07:43.233
HEY, PEOPLE.

07:43.233 --> 07:46.537
OH, HEY, SWEETIE.
I GOT YOU SOME FUDGE POPS.

07:46.537 --> 07:50.000
WHAT? TAKES SOME PREP TIME
TO BE ABLE TO BITCH-SLAP.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.546
GOOD MORNING, SUNSHINE.

07:55.546 --> 07:57.007
NO, TOO EARLY FOR HER.

07:57.007 --> 08:00.110
YOU CANNOT COMPLAIN
AFTER THE VERY FILTHY THINGS

08:00.110 --> 08:01.982
I DID TO YOU LAST NIGHT.

08:01.982 --> 08:05.716
MY DAD LEFT WHEN I WAS A KID.
GOT MESSED UP SEXUALLY.

08:05.716 --> 08:08.719
I HAD A CRAPPY FATHER, TOO,
BUT I DIDN'T GO SLUTTY.

08:08.719 --> 08:11.922
I JUST DIED INSIDE.
OH! YOU TWO HAVE
SO MANY CUTE THINGS IN COMMON.

08:11.922 --> 08:15.095
LET ME GET YOU SOME COFFEE.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.698
WOULD YOU CALM DOWN,
YOU BIG BABY?

08:17.698 --> 08:20.000
I LIKE HER. I'M NOT GONNA
SCREW THINGS UP FOR YOU.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.972
FOR INSTANCE, SARA WAS JUST

08:21.972 --> 08:24.535
TELLING ME YOU'RE NOT GREAT
AT THE CHEST-AREA FOREPLAY,

08:24.535 --> 08:27.538
SO YOU MIGHT WANNA SKIP THAT
IN THE FUTURE. YOU'RE WELCOME.

08:27.538 --> 08:29.810
I HATE YOU.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.111
I DON'T CARE.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.243
HUH?

08:33.243 --> 08:38.288
I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT THAT IS
MAKING ME REALLY SAD.

08:40.190 --> 08:43.994
OKAY,
SO STAN'S NOT YOUR TWIN.

08:43.994 --> 08:46.997
I'M SURE YOU GUYS HAVE
OTHER THINGS IN COMMON, RIGHT?

08:46.997 --> 08:49.800
YOU MEAN, DOES HE SHARE MY LOVE
OF BUTTER LETTUCE

08:49.800 --> 08:51.802
OR MARY HIGGINS CLARK NOVELS?

08:51.802 --> 08:53.804
I DON'T KNOW, LAURIE.
HE'S A BABY.

08:53.804 --> 08:57.237
ANDY, THINK. WHEN YOU WERE
HIS AGE, WHAT DID YOU LOVE?

08:57.237 --> 08:59.109
BABY ANIMALS.

08:59.109 --> 09:02.172
SEE? I BET THAT STAN
WILL LOVE BABY ANIMALS, TOO.

09:02.172 --> 09:05.646
OH! BOBBY SAID THERE'S
THAT PETTING ZOO AT THE PARK!

09:05.646 --> 09:07.648
HONEY, I'LL GO WITH YOU.

09:07.648 --> 09:10.020
THANKS, LAURIE.
YOU'RE BEING GREAT.
AW.

09:10.020 --> 09:11.321
NO, THAT'S CHEATING!

09:11.321 --> 09:12.783
OH! (laughs)
(laughs)

09:12.783 --> 09:15.085
TRAVIS, I ASKED YOUR DAD
TO COME HERE TODAY

09:15.085 --> 09:18.028
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING
REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT.

09:18.028 --> 09:21.031
NOW, SON, I KNOW HOW
YOU LOOK UP TO YOUR OLD MAN,

09:21.031 --> 09:23.133
AND I CAN DO NO WRONG
IN YOUR EYES.

09:23.133 --> 09:24.635
(groans)

09:24.635 --> 09:25.736
(whispers)
JUST GO WITH IT.

09:25.736 --> 09:28.699
THAT IS WHY THIS IS HARD
FOR ME TO ADMIT,

09:28.699 --> 09:30.701
BUT WHEN YOUR MOM AND I
WERE MARRIED,

09:30.701 --> 09:32.102
I CHEATED ON HER.

09:32.102 --> 09:33.804
(high-pitched voice) WHAT?

09:33.804 --> 09:35.806
(normal voice) NO!
WAIT. WHAT?

09:35.806 --> 09:39.850
HOLD ON. LET ME PICK SOMETHING
OFF THE FLOOR--MY JAW.

09:39.850 --> 09:41.782
YOU KNOW?
EVERYONE KNOWS.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.784
THE GUY AT THE PIZZA PLACE
WOULD SAY,

09:43.784 --> 09:46.116
"TWO MEDIUM PEPPERONIS,
AND YOU DESERVE BETTER."

09:46.116 --> 09:48.619
I FIGURED IT OUT
WHEN YOU GAVE ME A LOLLIPOP

09:48.619 --> 09:51.161
NOT TO TELL MOM I SAW YOU
AND THAT NATIVE AMERICAN LADY

09:51.161 --> 09:54.124
TAKING A... (lowers voice) BATH.
YOU NAILED LINDA BLACKFOOT?

09:54.124 --> 09:56.196
TRAVIS' SPEECH THERAPIST?

09:56.196 --> 09:59.299
I HAD A SPEECH THERAPIST?
YEAH. YOU COULDN'T SAY YOUR M's
WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.672
YOU SOUNDED LIKE
A TINY WHITE RAPPER.

10:01.672 --> 10:04.635
"MORE JUICE, PLEASE."
"MORE JUICE, PLEASE."

10:04.635 --> 10:06.606
(laughs)
(laughs)

10:06.606 --> 10:08.939
OKAY.
WE'RE GETTING OFF-TRACK.

10:08.939 --> 10:11.882
ALL RIGHT, TRAV,
YOUR MOM AND I BOTH AGREE.

10:11.882 --> 10:14.344
CHEATING ISN'T COOL.
YOU DON'T WANNA GO
YOUR DAD'S ROAD

10:14.344 --> 10:17.047
JUST HURTING GIRL
AFTER GIRL AFTER GIRL.

10:17.047 --> 10:19.720
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
I EVER CHEATED ON.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.922
OH, GOOD. I'M SPECIAL.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.223
JULES, LISTEN.

10:23.223 --> 10:26.356
I GOT NOTHIN'. I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA CUT ME OFF.

10:26.356 --> 10:30.100
DAMN IT, BOBBY. THE ONE THING
THAT MADE ME FEEL OKAY

10:30.100 --> 10:33.103
WAS THE FACT THAT I WASN'T
THE ONLY WOMAN YOU DID THIS TO.

10:33.103 --> 10:35.906
OKAY, OKAY. SO THE LESSON
HERE, TRAVIE, IS THAT

10:35.906 --> 10:38.268
IF YOU'RE GONNA CHEAT,
CHEAT ON EVERYONE EQUALLY.

10:38.268 --> 10:40.871
THAT IS NOT THE LESSON!

10:42.042 --> 10:44.144
YOU OWE ME A LOLLIPOP,
SNITCH.

10:45.816 --> 10:48.819
YOU KNOW, SARA, IT'S NOT EASY
FOR ME TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS.

10:48.819 --> 10:49.820
NO.

10:49.820 --> 10:52.222
KEEP MOVING, STRETCH.

10:52.222 --> 10:55.225
ANYWAY, I FEEL LIKE YOU AND I
HAVE REALLY CONNECTED.

10:55.225 --> 10:56.727
I MEAN, MOSTLY 'CAUSE

10:56.727 --> 10:58.989
YOU THINK I'M REALLY FUNNY
AND PRETTY AND...

10:58.989 --> 11:01.962
AND WHAT?
NO. IT'S YOUR TURN.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.193
BRAVE?

11:03.193 --> 11:05.896
BRAVE. I LIKE BEING BRAVE.

11:05.896 --> 11:07.437
CAN YOU ANSWER
A TOUGH QUESTION?

11:07.437 --> 11:09.740
OF COURSE. THAT'S HOW
BRAVE PEOPLE ROLL.

11:09.740 --> 11:11.742
THIS WHOLE
GRAYSON/JULES THING--

11:11.742 --> 11:14.274
YOU THINK I HAVE SOMETHING
TO WORRY ABOUT?

11:16.176 --> 11:18.208
THANKS FOR
TAKING CARE OF ME.

11:18.208 --> 11:21.211
WELL, THE FIRST TWO DOZEN
FRIED CHEESE STICKS WERE FREE.

11:21.211 --> 11:23.113
SOON YOU HAVE TO PAY.

11:23.113 --> 11:25.285
NO, I WON'T, 'CAUSE BOBBY
ONLY CHEATED ON ME.

11:25.285 --> 11:29.389
NOT SURE THAT ABSOLVES YOU
FROM FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.
HE WASN'T THE ONLY ONE.

11:29.389 --> 11:32.092
I REMEMBER I CAUGHT
BILLY MILLER IN KINDERGARTEN

11:32.092 --> 11:34.224
EATING ANOTHER GIRL'S PASTE.

11:34.224 --> 11:36.927
THAT'S NOT A METAPHOR,
IS IT?

11:36.927 --> 11:38.769
NO. AND GROSS!

11:38.769 --> 11:42.272
OKAY, SO WHAT? TWO PEOPLE.
IS THAT IT?
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

11:44.034 --> 11:45.275
JULES...

11:45.275 --> 11:48.078
AND GRAYSON. IS THIS
GOING TO BE FUN OR WEIRD?

11:48.078 --> 11:50.210
DID YOU EVER CHEAT ON ME?

11:50.210 --> 11:51.711
SO FUN, THEN.

11:53.183 --> 11:55.185
(goofy voice)
HI! I GOT LONG EARS.

11:55.185 --> 11:57.487
I GOT FLOPPY EARS.
I GOT FLOPPY, FLOPPY EARS.

11:57.487 --> 11:59.489
(normal voice)
SEE? STAN HATES IT.
(wailing)

11:59.489 --> 12:01.752
YEAH, BUT THAT MIGHT
HAVE MORE TO DO

12:01.752 --> 12:03.754
WITH THE WEIRD GOAT WRANGLER

12:03.754 --> 12:05.956
THAT DID "UPSY-DAISIES"
WITHOUT ASKING.

12:05.956 --> 12:10.000
(chicken clucking,
duck quacking)

12:10.000 --> 12:12.132
OH, NO, NO. BOBBY.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.905
(goat bleats)

12:14.905 --> 12:18.839
HEY! A GOOSE. I USED TO LOVE
GOOSEYS WHEN I WAS A KID.

12:18.839 --> 12:21.011
OH, THEN STAN'S GONNA
LOVE THEM, TOO.

12:21.011 --> 12:23.013
I'LL RECORD IT.
AND JUST F.Y.I.--

12:23.013 --> 12:25.315
IF YOU CAN GET STAN
TO RIDE THE GOOSE,

12:25.315 --> 12:27.948
WE WILL, LIKE,
SHUT DOWN THE INTERNET.
(honks)

12:27.948 --> 12:30.380
HEY, STAN,
SAY HI TO MR. HONK-HONK.

12:30.380 --> 12:33.954
(honks)
OW! OW, OW!
MR. HONK-HONK, NO! OW!

12:33.954 --> 12:36.286
NO, JULES,
I NEVER CHEATED.

12:36.286 --> 12:38.128
WELL, YOU HEARD HIM.
LET'S GO.

12:38.128 --> 12:40.760
ONCE WE WERE EXCLUSIVE,
I WAS TOTALLY FAITHFUL.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.492
LESS IS MORE, JEFF.

12:42.492 --> 12:44.494
WAIT. WE SLEPT TOGETHER
FOR THREE WEEKS

12:44.494 --> 12:46.166
BEFORE WE SAID
WE WERE EXCLUSIVE.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.468
RIGHT. BUT NOT EXCLUSIVELY.

12:48.468 --> 12:52.202
I WAS EXCLUSIVE.
I-I DIDN'T EVEN SELF-LOVE.

12:52.202 --> 12:54.174
WOW.
HOW'D YOU GET THROUGH IT?

12:54.174 --> 12:56.446
HE'S RIGHT. IT'S NOT THAT BIG
A SACRIFICE FOR WOMEN.

12:56.446 --> 12:58.448
IT IS IF YOU HAVE INSOMNIA,

12:58.448 --> 13:01.351
AND YOUR FRIEND FINALLY
TELLS YOU HOW TO DO IT

13:01.351 --> 13:04.384
SO YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE A FOOL--
YOU KNOW, LOCK THE DOOR,

13:04.384 --> 13:07.087
LIGHTS OUT, LOTS OF BLANKETS.
GOOD-BYE, JEFF.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.960
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY,
JULES.

13:09.960 --> 13:13.193
GRAYSON, YOU CAN GO, TOO.
RIGHT.

13:15.425 --> 13:18.228
ARE YOU IN YOUR BATHTUB
BECAUSE YOU'RE SAD?

13:18.228 --> 13:20.901
WHO CARES ABOUT JEFF?

13:20.901 --> 13:22.903
IT'S BOBBY, JEFF,
PASTE BOY--

13:22.903 --> 13:24.204
THEY ALL CHEATED.

13:24.204 --> 13:27.237
AND ALL THIS TIME,
I PUT IT ON THEM.

13:27.237 --> 13:29.179
BUT GUESS WHO'S
THE COMMON DENOMINATOR.

13:29.179 --> 13:31.141
DON'T MAKE ME SAY "YOU."

13:32.512 --> 13:34.184
YOU?

13:34.184 --> 13:35.946
ME.

13:35.946 --> 13:37.217
...ENOUGH, BUT...

13:37.217 --> 13:39.019
I BRING IT ON MYSELF.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.420
GOOD. YOU'RE HERE,

13:40.420 --> 13:43.193
PRETENDING TO GIVE JULES
A BATH.

13:43.193 --> 13:44.494
I SHOULD GO.

13:44.494 --> 13:47.958
NO, WAIT. YOU--
WHAT'D YOU SAY TO HER?

13:47.958 --> 13:49.129
STUFF.

13:51.561 --> 13:53.864
THAT'S NEVER GOOD.

14:03.013 --> 14:04.915
YOU REALLY SAID TO SARA

14:04.915 --> 14:08.418
SHE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT ME?
THAT MUST'VE BEEN HARD TO SAY.

14:08.418 --> 14:10.420
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
VERY BRAVE, JULES.

14:10.420 --> 14:13.423
WE KNOW THAT ABOUT ME,
PLUS SARA'S MY FRIEND AND I--

14:13.423 --> 14:15.255
WHOA. NOW SHE'S YOUR FRIEND?

14:15.255 --> 14:17.557
NO! I MEAN, WE JUST HAD
A GLASS OF WINE.

14:17.557 --> 14:20.130
YOU DRANK WINE WITH HER
DURING THE DAY?

14:20.130 --> 14:22.092
COME ON! THAT'S OUR THING.

14:22.092 --> 14:26.166
IS THERE ANYONE IN THE WORLD
THAT'S NOT CHEATING ON ME?
ARE YOU REALLY UPSET?

14:26.166 --> 14:30.170
NO. I MEAN,
YOU ARE A FILTHY SKANK.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.172
BUT I GUESS I'M PAST IT.

14:32.172 --> 14:36.947
YOU'RE LUCKY. NO ONE WOULD
EVER BETRAY YOU.
NO, THAT WOULD BE FOOLISH.

14:36.947 --> 14:40.110
(door opens and closes)
BUT GOOD OL' JULES--YOU KNOW,
JUST CHEAT ON HER ALL YOU WANT,

14:40.110 --> 14:42.953
AND SHE'LL STILL HAVE YOU
IN HER LIFE. HEY, TRAV.

14:42.953 --> 14:45.986
IF YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO'S
LOOKING FOR A HUMAN DOORMAT,

14:45.986 --> 14:47.958
TELL 'EM TO GIVE ME A CALL.
OKEYDOKEY, ARTICHOKE-Y.

14:47.958 --> 14:50.260
WHY ARE YOU SO HAPPY?

14:50.260 --> 14:52.422
KYLIE TOOK ME BACK. BOOM!

14:52.422 --> 14:55.495
THE DREAM CONTINUES.

14:55.495 --> 14:59.229
IT IS TOO LATE FOR ME,
BUT I CAN STILL SAVE HER.

14:59.229 --> 15:01.501
TRAVIS,
SOMEDAY YOU'LL THANK ME!

15:03.573 --> 15:05.305
AM I GONNA THANK HER?

15:05.305 --> 15:07.107
I DOUBT IT.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.209
DON'T LISTEN TO ELLIE.
NOW YES,

15:09.209 --> 15:11.211
I HAVE AN ATTRACTIVE
SINGLE FRIEND,

15:11.211 --> 15:13.913
BUT I'M SURE YOU HAVE
PLENTY OF THEM, TOO.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.546
YEAH, BUT I'VE SLEPT
WITH ALL MINE.

15:16.546 --> 15:19.419
WELL, I HAVEN'T.
OKAY, I HAVE... A LOT.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.191
BUT NOT WITH JULES.

15:21.191 --> 15:23.253
WHY NOT?
ARE YOU SAVING HER?

15:23.253 --> 15:25.255
SAVING HER?
SHE'S NOT A CUPCAKE.

15:25.255 --> 15:27.257
NOW LOOK. I'M WITH YOU.

15:27.257 --> 15:29.259
I'M GONNA CLOSE THE BAR
EARLY TONIGHT

15:29.259 --> 15:31.261
AND BE BACK HERE BY 8:00.
I'LL MAKE DINNER.

15:31.261 --> 15:34.104
THEN WE'LL JUMP IN THE SHOWER,
AND I'LL CLEAN YOUR BREASTS.

15:34.104 --> 15:36.306
YOU SAY THAT
LIKE IT'S FOR ME.

15:36.306 --> 15:39.269
HAVE YOU SEEN THOSE THINGS?
THEY'RE FILTHY.

15:43.213 --> 15:45.345
BOBBY, THIS CHICKEN
IS DELICIOUS.

15:45.345 --> 15:48.378
IT'S SPECIAL BIRD,
HAND-FED BY CHILDREN.

15:48.378 --> 15:49.949
ANDY,
WHY AREN'T YOU HAVING ANY?

15:49.949 --> 15:53.023
BECAUSE...

15:53.023 --> 15:54.154
(gasps)

15:54.154 --> 15:56.726
FREEZE!

15:56.726 --> 16:01.661
IS THAT A HICKEY ON YOUR NECK?
GO GET THE GARDEN SHEARS!

16:01.661 --> 16:04.034
NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S--IT'S A GOOSE BITE.

16:04.034 --> 16:07.137
I TOOK STAN TO THE PETTING ZOO.
PERMISSION TO UNFREEZE?

16:07.137 --> 16:09.039
NO! I'M SORRY, BOO.

16:09.039 --> 16:11.041
IT'S JUST
THIS WHOLE THING WITH JULES

16:11.041 --> 16:13.643
HAS PUT CHEATING
ON THE BRAIN.
I LET IT GO.

16:13.643 --> 16:16.176
THANK YOU. WHO'D YOU GO
TO THE PETTING ZOO WITH?

16:16.176 --> 16:18.678
NO ONE.

16:18.678 --> 16:21.311
KYLIE, WOMEN LIKE US
ARE ALWAYS GONNA GET HURT.

16:21.311 --> 16:24.154
WE--WE JUST LOVE TOO HARD.

16:24.154 --> 16:26.416
YOU KNOW,
MY MOM USED TO TELL ME THAT

16:26.416 --> 16:29.589
NO ONE WANTS TO BUY A COW WHEN
YOU CAN GET THE MILK FOR FREE.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.992
I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF MOM
CALLS THEIR DAUGHTER A COW?

16:32.992 --> 16:35.665
SHE GAVE ME EATING ISSUES.

16:35.665 --> 16:37.227
AND I'M 41 AND SKINNY,

16:37.227 --> 16:39.229
SO I SHOULD PROBABLY
"THANK" HER, RIGHT?

16:39.229 --> 16:41.231
I'VE NEVER HAD
REAL ICE CREAM.

16:41.231 --> 16:42.732
IS IT GOOD?

16:42.732 --> 16:47.006
JULES KIKI COBB,
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

16:47.006 --> 16:49.509
I LOVE YOU, TRAVIS,
BUT, KYLIE, HE'S A CHEAT.

16:49.509 --> 16:52.482
DON'T END UP LIKE ME.
DON'T BE A SUCKER.

16:52.482 --> 16:54.184
I KISSED TINA SPANGLER.

16:54.184 --> 16:57.347
YEAH, AND I KISSED JOEY SPANGLER

16:57.347 --> 16:59.519
AFTER THE H1N1 ASSEMBLY
LAST WEEK,

16:59.519 --> 17:02.392
SO WE'RE KINDA EVEN.

17:02.392 --> 17:04.524
SO YOU'RE BOTH SLUTS.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.526
WE'RE JUST BOTH
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.729
WE BOTH FIND
THE SPANGLER FAMILY ATTRACTIVE.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.331
HERE, LET'S GO.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.233
WOW.

17:14.334 --> 17:17.036
WAIT. WHY WOULDN'T
YOU JUST TELL ELLIE

17:17.036 --> 17:19.339
THAT YOU WENT
TO THE PETTING ZOO WITH ME?

17:19.339 --> 17:21.511
RIGHT, SO SHE CAN PICTURE US
LYING DOWN

17:21.511 --> 17:23.513
WITH ALL
THE TINY, BEAUTIFUL ANIMALS

17:23.513 --> 17:25.545
CRAWLING ALL OVER
OUR NAKED BODIES.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.748
THAT'S GROSS IN, LIKE,
A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS.

17:28.748 --> 17:32.122
HEY! IT'S GOOSE GUY. HUH?

17:32.122 --> 17:34.384
EH, EH, EH, EH...
(imitates goose honking)

17:34.384 --> 17:35.485
(laughs) AAH!

17:35.485 --> 17:38.228
OKAY, GREAT.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:38.228 --> 17:40.230
OUR VIDEO IS SO POPULAR.

17:40.230 --> 17:45.395
SOMEONE EVEN SENT IT TO ME...
FROM KOREA!

17:45.395 --> 17:48.298
OH, THIS IS NOT GOOD.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.272
UH, PASS?

17:54.674 --> 17:57.277
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT IS THIS?

17:57.277 --> 17:58.678
PLAIN VANILLA ICE CREAM.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.780
MMM!

18:00.780 --> 18:02.282
YOU KNOW WHAT SUCKS?

18:02.282 --> 18:05.285
I CAN'T EVER BE ONE
OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT SAYS,

18:05.285 --> 18:09.319
YOU KNOW, "IF YOU BETRAY ME,
WE'RE THROUGH."

18:09.319 --> 18:11.361
I ALWAYS FORGIVE, GRAYSON.

18:11.361 --> 18:13.293
I'M TOO GREAT A PERSON.

18:13.293 --> 18:14.294
(chuckles)

18:14.294 --> 18:16.326
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

18:16.326 --> 18:18.328
JUST...
SOMETIMES I JUST FEEL LIKE

18:18.328 --> 18:21.131
I'M ALWAYS WAITING AROUND
TO GET BURNT AGAIN.

18:21.131 --> 18:25.235
YOU'LL BE FINE.
YOU JUST NEED TO FIND THE GUY

18:25.235 --> 18:28.238
THAT CAN NEVER BEAR THE THOUGHT
OF HURTING YOU LIKE THAT.

18:29.439 --> 18:32.182
(alarm beeps)
HEY. IT'S 8:00.

18:32.182 --> 18:34.284
DIDN'T YOU
WANNA CLOSE UP EARLY?

18:34.284 --> 18:35.615
DON'T SWEAT IT.

18:35.615 --> 18:39.749
FROZEN YOGURT, YOU ARE
ICE CREAM'S... (whispers) BITCH.

18:41.821 --> 18:45.124
TELL HER.
TELL ME WHAT?

18:45.124 --> 18:48.127
ALL RIGHT, LAURIE WANTED ME
TO COME CLEAN ABOUT SOMETHING,

18:48.127 --> 18:52.362
AND BOBBY'S HERE TO PROTECT ME
IF THINGS GET VIOLENT.
AND TO MAKE MARGARITAS.
WHO WANTS ONE?

18:52.362 --> 18:53.833
YO!
ME!

18:53.833 --> 18:55.865
(Ellie) ME.
(laughs) MAN, I LOVE DRINKING.

18:55.865 --> 19:01.311
I... WAS NOT AT THE PETTING ZOO
ON MY OWN.

19:01.311 --> 19:03.213
I WENT WITH LAURIE.

19:03.213 --> 19:04.844
(blender whirring)

19:04.844 --> 19:06.846
(loudly)
I-I WAS JUST SPINNING

19:06.846 --> 19:09.349
BECAUSE OUR SON HAS NOTHING
IN COMMON WITH ME,

19:09.349 --> 19:11.351
AND PLEASE DON'T BE MAD...

19:11.351 --> 19:14.784
(whirring stops)
(normal voice)
PLEASE DON'T BE MAD WITH ME.

19:14.784 --> 19:18.288
WOW. HE MAKES MARGARITAS FAST.

19:18.288 --> 19:20.290
(Hungry Kids of Hungary's

19:20.290 --> 19:23.233
AND NOW WE WILL GO UPSTAIRS
WHILE I CHANGE STAN.

19:23.233 --> 19:25.265

19:25.265 --> 19:26.596
(Stan coos)
WHOA!

19:26.596 --> 19:27.697
HELLO!

19:27.697 --> 19:30.340
WHAT?
IT'S JUST BABY PRIVATE PARTS.

19:30.340 --> 19:33.773
THAT'S MORE LIKE GROWN MAN
PRIVATE PARTS ON A BABY.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.675
HOW DID YOU NOT KNOW THAT?

19:35.675 --> 19:38.948
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE I SEE
A LOT OF OTHER NAKED BABIES.

19:38.948 --> 19:40.950
SO IS HE, LIKE, BIG?

19:40.950 --> 19:43.313
(laughs) THAT'S LIKE
AN ELEPHANT TRUNK.

19:43.313 --> 19:46.756
(giggles)
SMILE. YOU HAVE SOMETHING
IN COMMON WITH YOUR SON.

19:46.756 --> 19:49.859
EEE! (laughs)

19:49.859 --> 19:53.663

19:53.663 --> 19:55.395
HEY. SORRY I'M LATE.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.927
JULES WAS REALLY DOWN,
AND I--

19:57.927 --> 20:00.270
YEAH, THAT MUST SUCK
FOR HER.

20:00.270 --> 20:04.274
I JUST STAYED TO SAY THAT
I'M GONNA GO--LIKE, GO GO.

20:04.274 --> 20:07.837
NO, NO, NO, NO.
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND, GRAYSON.

20:07.837 --> 20:10.340
в™Є ...RINGING TRUE в™Є

20:10.340 --> 20:14.944
в™Є SHOULD I RETURN

20:14.944 --> 20:16.446
в™Є LET'S START AGAIN в™Є

20:16.446 --> 20:19.819
WOW.
SHE DROVE OFF IN A HURRY.

20:19.819 --> 20:22.252
YEAH. YEAH, SHE DID.

20:22.252 --> 20:24.294
I'M SORRY.

20:24.294 --> 20:26.556
OH! DOES THIS MEAN
I CAN BE HER FRIEND NOW?

20:26.556 --> 20:28.398
NO! ELLIE, GO BACK INSIDE!

20:28.398 --> 20:29.899

20:29.899 --> 20:33.703

20:33.703 --> 20:35.265

20:35.265 --> 20:36.566
в™Є THIS HEART OF MINE в™Є

20:36.566 --> 20:38.568
ARE WE PLAYING
EMOTIONAL CHICKEN?

20:38.568 --> 20:41.411
BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO FAR AWAY,
AND THERE'S NO MUSIC.

20:41.411 --> 20:43.413
GOOD NIGHT, JULES.

20:43.413 --> 20:44.714
GOOD NIGHT, GRAYSON.

20:44.714 --> 20:48.418
в™Є ARREST THIS HEART OF MINE в™Є

21:07.637 --> 21:10.400
OKAY, THIS IS RIGHT BEFORE
THE GOOSE ATTACKED ANDY.

21:10.400 --> 21:13.673
WHO'S THAT TOOTHLESS CARNY CREEP

21:13.673 --> 21:16.746
UPSY-DAISY! (laughs)
(crying)

21:16.746 --> 21:18.277
(TV volume mutes)

21:18.277 --> 21:20.350
HE'S A GOOD GUY.
YOU IDIOT.

21:20.350 --> 21:22.912
WAIT. DAD.

21:22.912 --> 21:24.884
(duck quacking)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:24.884 --> 21:27.357
(goat bleats)

21:27.357 --> 21:30.390

21:31.721 --> 21:33.062
BOBBY, NO.
