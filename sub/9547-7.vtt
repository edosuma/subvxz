WEBVTT

00:09.949 --> 00:10.949
He's late.

00:11.165 --> 00:13.402
He's always running late,
mr. Monk. Just relax.

00:13.415 --> 00:15.367
If I could relax,
I wouldn't be here, would I?

00:17.091 --> 00:20.601
It's harold krenshaw. He's in there
right now. He knows I'm waiting.

00:20.627 --> 00:21.701
He knows it.

00:22.330 --> 00:25.600
Oh, they're never gonna catch him. 
-who? -The frisco fly.

00:25.800 --> 00:28.055
This is him on the 
Golden gate bridge.

00:28.155 --> 00:30.838
This is him, three weeks ago,
climbing coit tower.

00:30.905 --> 00:34.889
The police always get there too late.
He's like a real-life superhero.

00:35.522 --> 00:38.427
I wonder if he's single.
I wonder if he needs an assistant.

00:39.875 --> 00:41.742
Mr. Monk, what are you doing?

00:43.484 --> 00:44.500
He's crying.

00:44.600 --> 00:47.900
You can't listen in.
What if somebody listened to you?

00:48.630 --> 00:51.497
They wouldn't hear me
crying... Very often.

00:54.284 --> 00:55.284
Adrian.

00:56.409 --> 00:57.760
11:02, harold.

00:57.860 --> 00:59.727
Sorry. I guess we lost
track of the time.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.179
I heard you crying.

01:01.759 --> 01:05.942
- I was not crying.
- I heard you, harold, through the wall.

01:06.971 --> 01:09.221
We were laughing, you idiot.

01:09.433 --> 01:13.966
We were laughing. I told him a joke,
and we both just started laughing.

01:14.133 --> 01:15.717
He doesn't laugh.

01:15.817 --> 01:18.333
Yes, he does. 
He doesn't laugh with you.

01:18.433 --> 01:20.041
- Go to hell, harold.
- You go to hell!

01:20.608 --> 01:24.425
The only reason I would
even consider going to hell

01:24.652 --> 01:26.152
would be to visit you.

01:26.478 --> 01:28.906
You are really a sad, sad man.

01:29.006 --> 01:31.306
I don't know why
dr. Kroger even bothers.

01:32.204 --> 01:34.954
I wasn't crying.
I wasn't crying.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.031
Natalie.

01:39.323 --> 01:40.982
- Good-bye, harold.
- Bye.

01:50.504 --> 01:52.371
So how was your session?

01:54.262 --> 01:55.329
Mr. Monk?

01:57.477 --> 01:58.843
Natalie!
I just got it!

01:58.986 --> 02:01.703
Got what?
What I should have said to harold!

02:02.225 --> 02:04.099
Oh, my god.
A zinger!

02:04.199 --> 02:05.538
It's what they call a "comeback."

02:05.578 --> 02:07.250
Mr.Monk,
I don't think it really matters.

02:07.288 --> 02:09.723
No, no. Just listen, listen to this.
Listen to this.

02:10.115 --> 02:14.890
I said dr. Kroger doesn't laugh.
He said, "he doesn't laugh with you."

02:15.346 --> 02:17.206
what I should have said is,

02:17.904 --> 02:20.434
"maybe he's laughing atyou, harold."

02:21.361 --> 02:22.611
at you. Get it?

02:22.868 --> 02:25.506
At you. Get it?
At you.

02:25.606 --> 02:27.756
- Yeah, I got it.
- It would have destroyed him!

02:27.856 --> 02:31.411
He'd be boxed in.
He'd be boxed in.

02:31.586 --> 02:33.494
There's no possible response.

02:33.811 --> 02:35.769
- At you. Let's call him.
- Call him?

02:35.869 --> 02:38.143
Yeah. No!
No, you're right.

02:38.243 --> 02:40.470
You're right, you're right.
We'll go to his house.

02:40.511 --> 02:43.494
We'll do it in person. But we have to
hurry before he forgets what he said!

02:43.519 --> 02:45.412
No, Mr. Monk.
I don't think that's a good idea.

02:45.471 --> 02:46.681
Please, natalie.

02:46.943 --> 02:49.031
- I have so little.
- No, forget it.

02:49.131 --> 02:52.503
I am not driving downtown
so you can zing harold krenshaw.

02:52.603 --> 02:54.555
Why don't you just mail it to him?

02:57.373 --> 02:58.673
It's not the same.

03:11.040 --> 03:14.525
Hey, dad, look. It's him!
It's the frisco fly!

03:15.668 --> 03:18.584
- I can't believe it. It's actually him.
- Wow, he's awesome.

03:20.456 --> 03:21.889
Is he okay?

03:22.392 --> 03:25.292
Yeah, he's fine.
It's all part of the show.

03:30.282 --> 03:31.282
Come on.

03:31.782 --> 03:32.916
He's moving!

03:37.284 --> 03:40.400
- He's alive! Call 911!
- I already did. They're on their way!

03:40.696 --> 03:43.996
- The awning must've broken his fall.
- Be careful with him. Easy, easy.

03:44.682 --> 03:47.001
Hang on, fella. You're gonna be okay.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000

04:55.579 --> 04:57.557
- Where's natalie?
- Oh, she's still in the car.

04:57.657 --> 04:59.020
She's talking to Julie.

05:00.508 --> 05:01.508
One body?

05:02.107 --> 05:05.025
Yep. Driver. He was still behind
the wheel, buckled in.

05:05.125 --> 05:06.548
- Who was he?
- We don't know.

05:06.698 --> 05:08.158
The killer doesn't want us to know.

05:08.258 --> 05:10.773
Whoever did this stuck around

05:10.873 --> 05:12.672
and removed every bit of I.D.,

05:12.772 --> 05:15.139
filed off the vin
numbers off of the car.

05:15.782 --> 05:18.922
All we got is a gas can and
a flashlight. No fingerprints.

05:19.022 --> 05:22.778
Yeah, dr. G figured, uh,
it happened about four days ago.

05:23.456 --> 05:25.440
No, it was longer. At least a week.

05:26.307 --> 05:29.241
The grass is already
starting to grow back.

05:30.777 --> 05:33.004
It wasn't me. It was dr. G.

05:33.314 --> 05:35.630
- Cause of death?
- Vehicular homicide.

05:35.730 --> 05:38.681
Dr. G says the victim
was forced off the road.

05:39.272 --> 05:42.850
I don't think so. There's no
dents on the side or the rear.

05:43.574 --> 05:45.358
I think this was an accident.

05:46.259 --> 05:47.259
Look,

05:48.092 --> 05:51.026
I think this poor guy hit a deer. Look.

05:55.642 --> 05:57.025
A little piece of antler.

05:58.723 --> 06:01.623
Plus,
the headlights were off,

06:01.723 --> 06:04.090
so this must have
happened during the day.

06:04.652 --> 06:07.569
But the guy burned the car later.

06:08.423 --> 06:09.781
He needed the flashlight.

06:10.144 --> 06:13.611
- I guess dr. G is 0 for 2.
- This doesn't track, does it?

06:13.711 --> 06:15.955
The guy hits a deer, runs off the road,

06:16.055 --> 06:18.731
crashes into a rock, dead on impact,

06:19.214 --> 06:22.883
a few hours go by, maybe a day.
Somebody comes along, a stranger.

06:22.984 --> 06:26.092
He files the vin number off the engine,
which would have taken a few hours,

06:26.192 --> 06:28.092
then torches the car and the body.

06:28.192 --> 06:30.493
- Why?
- Why, indeed. Is that poison ivy?

06:30.652 --> 06:31.652
No.

06:31.926 --> 06:33.936
- Oh, thank god.
- It's poison oak.

06:34.002 --> 06:36.887
Wait, you guys. You're not gonna believe
what I just heard on the radio.

06:36.939 --> 06:37.996
I've got some weird news,

06:38.096 --> 06:41.121
and some really weird news and some
really, really, really weird news.

06:41.221 --> 06:42.325
What do you want first?

06:42.425 --> 06:43.883
Uh, I guess the weird news.

06:43.983 --> 06:45.794
Okay, you know the frisco fly,
the daredevil?

06:45.840 --> 06:48.440
He was just climbing
telegraph tower and he fell off.

06:50.842 --> 06:52.542
Hmm. And what's the really weird news?

06:52.642 --> 06:54.342
He's okay.
It's a miracle.

06:54.575 --> 06:57.325
He hit a flagpole and two
awnings on the way down.

06:57.425 --> 06:59.875
What's the really, really, really...

07:00.441 --> 07:01.507
What's the last one?

07:01.780 --> 07:03.213
It's harold krenshaw.

07:03.449 --> 07:04.832
He's the frisco fly.

07:13.053 --> 07:14.053
What?

07:16.284 --> 07:17.392
It doesn't make any sense.

07:17.492 --> 07:19.984
Harold krenshaw is more
afraid of heights than I am.

07:20.084 --> 07:21.782
He's more afraid of everything.

07:21.882 --> 07:24.389
- Well, apparently he got over it.
- How? How did he do it?

07:24.489 --> 07:26.013
- I don't know.
- How did he do it?

07:26.113 --> 07:28.413
- I don't know.
- Okay. But how did he do it?

07:28.513 --> 07:31.322
I don't know. Harold krenshaw.
Friend or family?

07:31.422 --> 07:32.422
Neither.

07:32.776 --> 07:34.425
We have the same therapist.

07:34.525 --> 07:37.003
They're very good friends.
They just don't like to admit it.

07:37.103 --> 07:38.193
Room 312.

07:38.443 --> 07:39.502
Oh, do me a favor.

07:39.602 --> 07:42.231
Tell him sylvia said
thank you for the autograph.

07:42.331 --> 07:43.331
My nieces loved it.

07:43.405 --> 07:47.201
My family can't believe I actually
met the frisco fly. I can't believe it.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.832
- How is he doing?
- Oh, much better.

07:48.907 --> 07:50.324
I was here when they brought him in.

07:50.382 --> 07:52.940
At first, he kept denying
he was the frisco fly.

07:52.954 --> 07:53.969
Really?

07:54.069 --> 07:57.224
- Yeah.
- Modest and brave. If I wasn't married.

08:06.027 --> 08:08.185
Look at me. I'm a hero sandwich!

08:11.605 --> 08:13.205
You were telling us about the accident.

08:13.582 --> 08:16.578
The last thing I rember,
I was almost at the top,

08:16.678 --> 08:19.558
which we call "the summit,"
and I lost my footing.

08:19.951 --> 08:21.241
I must've slipped.

08:21.341 --> 08:22.765
You had a parachute. Why didn't you?

08:22.865 --> 08:24.780
It happened so quick. I wasn't thinking.

08:25.480 --> 08:27.213
Next time, I'll know better.

08:27.413 --> 08:28.963
So there will be a next time?

08:30.770 --> 08:32.054
I'd better not say.

08:32.154 --> 08:33.655
Are there any cops in here?

08:34.484 --> 08:37.001
Oh, honey, look at this.
It's from evel knievel.

08:37.905 --> 08:41.409
- I... I still can't find my glasses.
- Okay, I'll read it.

08:41.509 --> 08:43.485
It says "harold, you are the man.

08:43.605 --> 08:46.772
P.S. Next time, check
your damn parachute."

08:49.041 --> 08:50.608
evel. What a character.

08:52.376 --> 08:55.092
Jimmy, how do you feel?
Are you proud of your dad?

08:55.192 --> 08:56.192
I am now.

08:57.009 --> 08:58.826
I used to be kind of embarrassed.

08:58.990 --> 09:00.590
I could hear him downstairs,

09:00.907 --> 09:02.524
crying and cursing all night.

09:02.690 --> 09:04.724
But now I know what he was really doing.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.045
Planning his next big stunt.

09:08.385 --> 09:09.585
I love you, dad.

09:10.123 --> 09:11.339
I love you, too.

09:13.560 --> 09:16.327
Oh, harold, your cousin joey's here.

09:16.624 --> 09:19.891
- Harry. How are you feeling, cuz?
- Fine.

09:20.086 --> 09:22.463
Uncle ronnie couldn't make it.
He's not doing too well.

09:22.563 --> 09:24.737
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

09:24.837 --> 09:27.587
- Who's uncle ronnie?
- Last of the original krenshaws.

09:27.687 --> 09:30.391
He owns a dude ranch in nevada.
About a thousand acres.

09:30.508 --> 09:32.291
Me and harry used
to go down every summer.

09:33.425 --> 09:35.894
- What was harold like as a kid?
- This guy?

09:36.036 --> 09:38.419
He was indestructible,
and that's a fact.

09:38.636 --> 09:41.052
Me and uncle ronnie used
to throw him off the roof,

09:41.152 --> 09:43.919
then down the stairs, then off the dock.
Remember?

09:45.939 --> 09:47.880
Yeah, me and uncle ronnie
was just goofing off,

09:47.980 --> 09:49.949
but for harold, I guess it was practice!

09:52.550 --> 09:54.669
Okay, that's it, folks. Everyone out.

09:55.221 --> 09:57.971
I've got to change those bandages.
You can come back after dinner.

10:01.129 --> 10:02.229
I'll call you later.

10:02.929 --> 10:03.962
Thank you.

10:06.645 --> 10:07.645
Adrian?

10:09.360 --> 10:10.710
I knew you'd come.

10:11.167 --> 10:13.377
Can I talk to him?
It'll just be a minute.

10:13.477 --> 10:16.100
Oh, I can't say no to the frisco fly.

10:16.278 --> 10:17.328
Two minutes.

10:18.446 --> 10:19.580
I'll be right outside.

10:21.113 --> 10:22.180
Bye, harold.

10:28.999 --> 10:29.999
So...

10:31.801 --> 10:33.377
The frisco fly, huh?

10:36.542 --> 10:39.275
- You look surprised.
- Iamsurprised.

10:40.350 --> 10:43.509
Here's the thing I can't figure out.
You look surprised too.

10:45.066 --> 10:46.666
It's killing you, isn't it?

10:48.505 --> 10:49.822
How did you do it, harold?

10:50.489 --> 10:52.372
You've always been afraid of heights.

10:52.830 --> 10:57.017
You got vertigo when dr. Kroger put in
thicker carpet, remember?

10:57.693 --> 10:58.760
I'm cured.

11:00.577 --> 11:01.585
How?

11:01.836 --> 11:03.003
It wasn't easy.

11:03.938 --> 11:05.269
I'll be honest with you.

11:06.123 --> 11:07.659
I don't think you can do it.

11:08.742 --> 11:11.371
You don't have it in you.
It takes strength.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.758
I'm not talking about physical strength,

11:14.465 --> 11:16.015
although I've got plenty of that.

11:16.291 --> 11:18.024
I'm talking aboutit.
It?

11:19.762 --> 11:22.259
- It?
- Yeah. The right stuff.

11:22.552 --> 11:24.102
Strength of character.

11:25.465 --> 11:26.465
I have it.

11:27.018 --> 11:28.485
Neil armstrong has it.

11:29.366 --> 11:30.425
Rocky has it.

11:30.525 --> 11:33.527
- Rockywas just a movie, harold.
- Excuse me.

11:33.627 --> 11:35.104
I'm a little confused.

11:35.263 --> 11:38.198
I just fell off telegraph tower.
How was your day?

11:38.531 --> 11:39.681
Here's what I do know.

11:39.814 --> 11:45.531
You don't have it, and you never,
ever, ever, ever, ever, ever will!

11:52.256 --> 11:53.256
Mr. Monk.

11:54.405 --> 11:55.405
Mr. Monk.

11:55.478 --> 11:56.519
It couldn't be him.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.560
He fell off a building.
There were 50 witnesses.

11:59.660 --> 12:02.117
I know it was him. Of course it was him.

12:07.537 --> 12:08.859
But it couldn't be him.

12:12.857 --> 12:16.104
For the record, my crush on
the frisco fly is officially over.

12:16.204 --> 12:20.025
He's not the frisco fly.
He can't be. He can't be.

12:20.537 --> 12:21.937
- No, thank you.
- No.

12:22.111 --> 12:25.605
You know, mr. Monk,
you and harold have a lot in common.

12:25.705 --> 12:28.696
I think that you could
actually be friends.

12:28.796 --> 12:29.987
I don't think so.

12:30.087 --> 12:33.092
The fact that I despise him
would always come between us.

12:33.332 --> 12:34.965
Harold, harold!

12:36.940 --> 12:41.443
Fly! Frisco fly!
I love you! Harold!

12:41.543 --> 12:42.543
Mr. Fly!

12:42.900 --> 12:45.556
That's not him. His room is up there.

12:46.973 --> 12:48.423
You mean you've met him?

12:48.709 --> 12:51.070
- What's he like?
- I've seen his file.

12:51.453 --> 12:53.495
He wet his bed till he was 34.

12:53.595 --> 12:56.002
And he has to be hypnotized
to get his hair cut.

12:56.102 --> 12:57.561
Excuse me. You were up there?

12:57.661 --> 13:00.229
Yeah, is he okay? Cause we
heard he broke, like, seven ribs.

13:00.329 --> 13:03.834
Yeah. What he broke was
at least seven city ordinances.

13:03.934 --> 13:06.115
The cops won't press charges.
They wouldn't dare.

13:06.215 --> 13:07.839
- He's a real-life hero.
- He's a hero.

13:07.997 --> 13:11.664
He is not a hero!
What is wrong with you people?

13:11.796 --> 13:13.626
I mean, he fell, right?

13:13.726 --> 13:15.868
A daredevil basically has one job...

13:16.100 --> 13:17.233
Not falling.

13:17.783 --> 13:19.203
I mean, I could fall.

13:20.095 --> 13:22.329
I bet I could fall
100 stories if I tried.

13:22.974 --> 13:25.249
Why don't you, man?
In fact, I'd be glad to help.

13:25.301 --> 13:26.767
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

13:26.820 --> 13:31.040
Now, don't hurt him. Hey, ask yourself,
what would harold do?

13:31.140 --> 13:35.505
Yeah I hate to tell you this. I've known
arold krenshaw for 31/2 years,

13:35.605 --> 13:39.790
and he is a lot of things, but he is not
the frisco flyer.

13:40.370 --> 13:41.520
Oh, yeah, man?

13:41.748 --> 13:43.141
Well, we were there.

13:43.513 --> 13:45.780
We saw him fall,
so how do you explain that?

13:45.964 --> 13:48.647
We saw
him fall.

14:08.403 --> 14:09.620
It's so quiet.

14:11.341 --> 14:12.491
It is quiet.

14:12.807 --> 14:14.457
Which I prefer, actually.

14:15.093 --> 14:18.427
It makes it easier to hear the voices
in my head, screaming and pleading.

14:18.750 --> 14:19.750
Are you okay?

14:19.977 --> 14:20.977
I'm fine.

14:21.476 --> 14:23.093
How high are we?

14:23.847 --> 14:25.464
Uh, 24 stories.

14:26.131 --> 14:27.131
Yeah.

14:27.758 --> 14:30.425
All right, so that's west,

14:30.621 --> 14:33.387
which means he fell off
the roof over there.

14:33.584 --> 14:35.584
It's not possible.

14:35.971 --> 14:38.238
I just came up in the elevator
and it nearly killed me.

14:38.239 --> 14:39.762
You're telling me harold krenshaw

14:39.862 --> 14:43.256
climbed up the side of this building?
Will you shut up?!

14:43.832 --> 14:44.832
Shut it!

14:45.287 --> 14:46.504
Not... Not you.

14:47.122 --> 14:49.483
Okay, but Mr. Monk,
everybody saw him fall off the roof.

14:49.583 --> 14:50.649
Maybe not.

14:50.749 --> 14:52.659
What if he had two costumes,

14:53.404 --> 14:55.355
and he put one costume on a dummy,

14:55.455 --> 14:58.382
hired someone to throw
the dummy off the roof.

14:58.854 --> 15:02.655
Meanwhile, krenshaw
is down below, hiding,

15:02.790 --> 15:05.740
in the other costume,
waiting to be discovered.

15:06.591 --> 15:09.881
There. Mystery solved.
Will you stop interrupting?

15:09.981 --> 15:11.562
I'm not gonna tell you again.

15:11.662 --> 15:14.052
Okay, Mr. Monk,
harold krenshaw almost died.

15:14.202 --> 15:16.726
He had a concussion
and five broken ribs.

15:16.826 --> 15:18.875
Are you saying that was self-inflicted?

15:19.032 --> 15:21.167
Why would he do that?
Why would anybody do that?

15:21.267 --> 15:22.817
- To get to me.
- You?

15:23.375 --> 15:25.244
So this is about you?

15:25.996 --> 15:27.496
Not entirely.

15:28.618 --> 15:30.068
It's mainly me.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.673
- He's obsessed with me, natalie.
- Okay. What happened to the dummy?

15:33.773 --> 15:35.970
If somebody threw it
off the roof, where'd it go?

15:36.154 --> 15:40.107
What about the real frisco fly? He would
have contacted the press by now.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.362
Here's all I know.

15:41.729 --> 15:44.345
Harold krenshaw was never on this roof.

15:44.612 --> 15:45.843
There is no way.

15:47.773 --> 15:50.226
Eyeglasses.
They look like harold's.

15:50.692 --> 15:52.391
He said he lost his, remember?

15:52.491 --> 15:55.040
- They couldn't be.
- They're engraved.

15:55.224 --> 15:56.824
Look. "H. K."

15:57.366 --> 15:58.891
Oh, my god.

16:00.465 --> 16:01.832
It really was him.

16:03.203 --> 16:05.423
Wait. Mr. Monk, this is good news.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.298
This should inspire you.

16:07.445 --> 16:11.610
If harold krenshaw can overcome
his fears, then you can too.

16:13.332 --> 16:16.598
Sure you can!
I'll help you. We'll do it together.

16:20.360 --> 16:24.319
Okay, so we're just going
to take this really slow.

16:25.228 --> 16:26.228
Mr. Monk?

16:27.201 --> 16:29.885
Okay, now,
you're afraid of a lot of things.

16:29.985 --> 16:32.251
- 312.
- Right, 312.

16:32.351 --> 16:36.348
But all we want to do today
is beat one of them.

16:36.658 --> 16:37.658
Wouldn't that be great

16:37.725 --> 16:40.142
if we just crossed one of
those right off your list?

16:40.752 --> 16:42.929
Okay, here are four things
that you're scared of,

16:43.029 --> 16:45.011
but don't worry, you don't have to do

16:45.111 --> 16:47.190
all of them. You can just pick one.

16:47.562 --> 16:51.897
You can drink the milk,
or you could play the harmonica,

16:52.251 --> 16:55.491
put the ladybug on your finger,
or you can climb the ladder.

16:56.491 --> 16:57.543
That's a big ladder.

16:57.865 --> 16:59.041
It's only four feet.

17:00.175 --> 17:01.975
Harold krenshaw did it...

17:02.922 --> 17:05.887
- Excuse me?
- Is this how harold krenshaw did it?

17:06.204 --> 17:08.813
Why, I don't know, Mr. Monk.
But yeah, probably.

17:08.913 --> 17:09.963
Something like this.

17:10.282 --> 17:12.761
You know what?
Soon you'll be climbing skyscrapers!

17:13.641 --> 17:17.616
Oh, no. We're not even gonna think
about that right now.

17:17.657 --> 17:19.992
We're just going to
concentrate on one thing, okay?

17:20.126 --> 17:22.596
Uh, baby steps, okay?
Little baby steps.

17:23.175 --> 17:24.275
Here you go.

17:25.311 --> 17:27.806
- Baby step.
- Baby steps!

17:30.229 --> 17:31.229
Which one?

17:52.133 --> 17:53.474
Oh, wait, I forgot.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.710
come on, come on.
You can do it, you're doing great.

18:56.183 --> 18:59.117
- Is there a fifth thing?
- No.

19:06.105 --> 19:07.372
The ladybug.

19:08.101 --> 19:09.101
Let me try.

19:14.689 --> 19:16.692
Okay.
Put out your hand.

19:24.423 --> 19:26.903
Yes, yes. Oh, my gosh!

19:27.003 --> 19:28.749
Yes, you're doing it.
You're doing it.

19:28.997 --> 19:31.779
You got it.
That's great, mr. Monk.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.879
Oh, yeah, yeah.

19:40.795 --> 19:41.878
A ladybug?

19:42.983 --> 19:43.983
It was this big.

19:44.446 --> 19:45.846
You could barely see it.

19:46.655 --> 19:48.771
But I was the one who was scared.

19:50.199 --> 19:53.105
- When he flew away, I thought,
- that little insect...

19:54.913 --> 19:56.213
Happier than me.

19:57.555 --> 19:59.422
He's happier than I'll ever be.

20:01.389 --> 20:04.332
Adrian, you know when you talk this way,
I get a little concerned.

20:04.432 --> 20:05.874
How did he do it?

20:06.443 --> 20:09.410
The man was a basket case, right?

20:10.619 --> 20:13.916
- We're talking about harold krenshaw?
- Harold krenshaw

20:14.436 --> 20:19.428
is climbing buildings.
Skyscrapers. And he's parachuting!

20:21.114 --> 20:22.981
Whatever it is you did for him,

20:24.145 --> 20:25.939
why can't you do it for me?

20:26.039 --> 20:28.766
- I didn't do anything.
- Did you hypnotize him? no.

20:28.866 --> 20:32.506
Some kind of special, new treatment?

20:32.606 --> 20:34.407
The 10:00 session, is that it?

20:34.955 --> 20:37.821
It's one hour earlier, so

20:38.062 --> 20:41.249
you're sharper, you're fresher.

20:41.685 --> 20:44.814
Adrian, I'm really not comfortable
talking about other patients.

20:44.914 --> 20:47.799
Oh. I'd hate to make you
feel uncomfortable.

20:48.274 --> 20:49.491
We wouldn't want that.

20:50.243 --> 20:54.040
I'm dying over here, but
as long as you're comfortable.

20:54.551 --> 20:55.551
Are you warm enough?

20:56.610 --> 20:57.610
Are you thirsty?

20:58.591 --> 21:00.457
Can I get you some water?

21:09.192 --> 21:10.275
I'm sorry.

21:10.882 --> 21:15.077
I understand how upset you are,
but the fact is that when I heard

21:15.177 --> 21:17.261
that it was harold up on the roof,

21:17.361 --> 21:20.882
the frisco fly,
I was as surprised as anyone.

21:21.038 --> 21:25.338
But whatever harold did, whatever
he accomplished, he did it on his own.

21:26.731 --> 21:29.498
I'd like to take credit
for it, but it wasn't me.

21:31.252 --> 21:33.894
So no matter how bad it got,

21:33.994 --> 21:37.361
no matter how low I sank,

21:38.355 --> 21:40.640
I could always say...

21:43.608 --> 21:45.562
"At least I'm not harold krenshaw."

21:50.959 --> 21:52.807
he was my northern star.

21:55.887 --> 22:00.156
He was the only thing in the world
I could really, count on.

22:11.614 --> 22:13.133
You know, you're unbuttoned.

22:18.229 --> 22:21.342
Adrian, it's been a while since
we talked about medication,

22:21.442 --> 22:25.013
but there are some new
anti-depressants on the market.

22:25.278 --> 22:26.278
It doesn't matter.

22:29.833 --> 22:30.833
I give up.

22:31.502 --> 22:34.152
Did you just say, "I give up"?

22:36.129 --> 22:38.162
Captain, we got a hit.

22:38.342 --> 22:40.133
A gas can by the burned-out car?

22:40.233 --> 22:44.705
It was bought 15 days ago at a hardware
store, g & g hardware in pacifica,

22:44.805 --> 22:46.101
eight miles from the crash site.

22:46.201 --> 22:48.077
And they don't remember who bought it.

22:48.180 --> 22:49.222
And he paid with cash.

22:49.274 --> 22:52.126
Of course no security camera,
no picture, but...

22:52.200 --> 22:53.183
But?

22:53.257 --> 22:54.331
We can I.D. The car.

22:54.669 --> 22:55.780
We got the vin number.

22:56.187 --> 22:58.220
It was on the radiator support bracket.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.905
Guess our boy must have forgot that.

23:00.005 --> 23:02.769
They always forget
the radiator support bracket.

23:03.830 --> 23:05.946
Vehicle identification...

23:06.140 --> 23:07.773
Universal tracking program.

23:09.183 --> 23:10.316
Come on, come on, come on.

23:11.549 --> 23:13.990
- Okay, shoot.
-First letter "t," as in tsunami.

23:14.265 --> 23:16.465
- The tsunami.
- Silent "t."

23:18.503 --> 23:20.928
wha... No, "t" as in "tom."
just say "tom."

23:21.563 --> 23:22.593
what's the difference?

23:22.882 --> 23:23.966
It doesn't...

23:24.559 --> 23:25.692
The "t" is silent.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.066
It's not completely silent.

23:28.626 --> 23:29.676
T- sunami.

23:30.494 --> 23:32.491
All right, all right. Let's go.

23:32.591 --> 23:35.485
Uh, second letter, "p" as in...
"P" as in "paul."

23:35.585 --> 23:37.531
-  No.
- Too late. I typed it. "P."

23:37.871 --> 23:40.604
yeah, but the person reading
the letters gets to say the word.

23:40.704 --> 23:42.758
- That's how we do it.
- That's how who does it?

23:43.654 --> 23:45.693
Society. We live in a society.

23:45.795 --> 23:49.839
Yes, we do randy. Meanwhile the p's been
sitting on my screen for ten minutes.

23:50.143 --> 23:52.467
Fine. "P" for pan. No. Panavision.

23:52.724 --> 23:55.399
Tsunami, panavision.
The next letter, "l."

23:55.444 --> 23:56.861
-  "l."
- as in...

23:57.238 --> 23:58.536
No, we can come back to that one.

23:58.548 --> 24:00.863
No, we can't come back to it, randy. We.

24:02.106 --> 24:04.828
Whoever this is, thank you
very much for calling.

24:05.818 --> 24:06.818
When?

24:07.772 --> 24:08.772
Is he okay?

24:10.420 --> 24:11.590
We'll be right there.

24:13.219 --> 24:16.296
- Come on.
- what?

24:16.739 --> 24:17.756
Come on.

25:01.524 --> 25:02.791
Suicide watch.

25:28.405 --> 25:30.722
Harold!
Harold krenshaw!

25:33.205 --> 25:34.522
Harold krenshaw!

25:40.571 --> 25:42.794
I've never actually
seen him sleep before.

25:42.894 --> 25:44.881
Sometimes I wonder what he dreams about.

25:45.432 --> 25:46.865
Cleaning supplies.

25:48.304 --> 25:50.601
No, I think he dreams
about a perfect world

25:50.701 --> 25:53.061
with no surprises, no emotion.

25:53.161 --> 25:55.957
Everything is clean and neat
and in groups of ten.

25:56.902 --> 25:59.053
For anybody else,
that would be a nightmare.

25:59.153 --> 26:01.397
Yeah.
Oh, he's smiling.

26:01.691 --> 26:03.225
I'm glad he's happy somewhere.

26:03.677 --> 26:05.227
He's probably talking to Trudy.

26:07.947 --> 26:08.947
Yep.

26:11.019 --> 26:13.608
Hey, why don't you take off?
You have a life.

26:15.461 --> 26:16.594
I can stick around.

26:17.113 --> 26:19.849
Nah. Julie's with my folks. I can stay.

26:19.987 --> 26:21.904
Well, I hope he enjoys it while he can.

26:23.727 --> 26:27.105
Cause when he wakes up, it's back
to reality. Have you seen this?

26:27.484 --> 26:30.967
The whole city's gone ga-ga
over harold krenshaw.

26:33.232 --> 26:35.715
Hey, how you feelin'?

26:42.673 --> 26:44.505
After years of thrilling the public

26:44.605 --> 26:49.237
"and eluding authorities"
the frisco fly's true identity...

26:49.337 --> 26:52.567
"Mild-mannered loan
officer Harold krenshaw,

26:52.996 --> 26:56.513
school board member,
a real-life spider-man."

26:57.480 --> 26:59.030
he's not spider-man.

26:59.902 --> 27:02.490
Spider-man goes around helping people.

27:02.590 --> 27:05.845
- Yeah. You're spider-man.
- Where are my shoelaces?

27:09.479 --> 27:11.088
- Dr. Kroger thought that...
- Yeah.

27:11.188 --> 27:12.645
Okay, I get it.

27:13.292 --> 27:15.172
- Where are you going?
- Bathroom.

27:15.272 --> 27:16.281
Why?

27:18.918 --> 27:22.257
- I'll go with you.
- I don't think so.

27:22.690 --> 27:23.840
No, let me go with you.

27:24.137 --> 27:26.235
We promised dr. Kroger
we wouldn't leave you alone.

27:26.335 --> 27:27.989
I am not suicidal.

27:28.089 --> 27:29.911
I just wish I was never born.

27:30.255 --> 27:31.255
There's a difference.

27:31.348 --> 27:33.282
Monk, I gotta go with you.

27:33.686 --> 27:34.686
I won't look.

27:35.567 --> 27:38.127
That doesn't mean anything.
I'm not gonna look either.

27:39.123 --> 27:40.276
Okay.

27:41.393 --> 27:42.881
You're gonna leave the door open.

27:42.981 --> 27:45.232
Leave the door open?
Have we met?

27:45.541 --> 27:47.588
Monk, I am just looking out for you.

27:48.225 --> 27:49.800
You're not going in there alone.

27:53.466 --> 27:54.799
Then I'm not going.

28:22.568 --> 28:25.443
Well, this is ridiculous.
You can't hold it in forever.

28:25.527 --> 28:27.673
- I think I can.
- Then so can I.

28:29.376 --> 28:31.209
My record is nine days.

28:33.908 --> 28:36.554
Let's keep going
all the way to the ice machine.

28:36.773 --> 28:39.093
That's the spirit.
That's the frisco fly spirit.

28:39.193 --> 28:41.352
- Excuse me, mr. Krenshaw.
- Yeah?

28:41.452 --> 28:42.452
I'm sara hollins.

28:42.540 --> 28:45.088
I teach kindergarten
at st. Mark's elementary.

28:45.188 --> 28:47.263
This is evan, and this is molly.

28:47.363 --> 28:48.463
- Hello.
- hi.

28:48.605 --> 28:49.605
Hello.

28:49.688 --> 28:52.452
The kids just adore you.
You're all they talk about.

28:52.552 --> 28:54.644
We've been waiting downstairs all day.

28:54.744 --> 28:56.057
They wanted to give you this.

29:00.491 --> 29:01.956
It's a picture of you.

29:02.056 --> 29:03.382
That's me, huh?

29:03.666 --> 29:05.340
Well, I hope not.

29:05.440 --> 29:07.108
Look at the size of my head.

29:07.208 --> 29:09.050
I'm surprised you can stand up.

29:09.574 --> 29:11.932
I know.
And what is that?

29:12.403 --> 29:14.298
- The golden gate bridge.
- Really?

29:14.604 --> 29:16.373
What's keeping it up, magic?

29:16.473 --> 29:18.836
Because I don't see
any suspension cables.

29:18.986 --> 29:20.569
- Joey, you got a pen?
- yeah. 

29:20.752 --> 29:22.369
What's the matter with you?

29:22.650 --> 29:23.650
Okay.

29:29.466 --> 29:31.516
Now it's a bridge.

29:31.622 --> 29:33.387
It's basic physics.

29:33.487 --> 29:34.795
They're only six years old.

29:34.895 --> 29:36.438
They're not gonna learn any younger.

29:36.538 --> 29:38.238
That's what my uncle ronnie always says.

29:38.338 --> 29:39.717
What's this, a bird?

29:39.817 --> 29:42.387
My god, it must be 20 feet long. yeah.

29:42.487 --> 29:43.749
It looks like mothra.

29:43.849 --> 29:45.519
Remember that old movie?

29:49.303 --> 29:51.003
You're on the school board?

29:51.312 --> 29:52.312
Yeah.

29:55.145 --> 29:56.888
- Hello.
- Mr. Krenshaw?

29:56.988 --> 29:57.988
That's right.

29:58.078 --> 29:59.832
This is dr. Levine, calling from reno.

29:59.932 --> 30:02.790
You wanted me to call if there was
a change in your uncle's condition.

30:03.054 --> 30:04.504
I'm afraid it doesn't look good.

30:04.629 --> 30:06.961
You might want to think about
coming home to say good-bye.

30:07.027 --> 30:08.104
How long does he have?

30:08.604 --> 30:11.387
Five days. Maybe a week.
I'm sorry, son.

30:12.648 --> 30:13.681
Thank you, doctor.

30:15.075 --> 30:19.359
All right, kids, you got your notes.

30:19.459 --> 30:22.261
I want you to go back
to school and try again.

30:22.361 --> 30:23.543
- Oh.
- Hit it.

30:23.643 --> 30:25.025
Bye-bye.

30:26.121 --> 30:27.822
- That was nice.
- Who was that?

30:27.922 --> 30:31.048
Cousin, that was money calling.
Endorsement money.

30:31.148 --> 30:33.665
- You ever heard of neptune energy bars?
- No.

30:33.765 --> 30:34.953
Well, they've heard of you.

30:35.053 --> 30:37.939
They want to pay you ten grand
to be in their next commercial.

30:38.149 --> 30:40.710
But they're on a tight schedule.
They need to shoot tomorrow.

30:40.727 --> 30:41.810
You think you're up for it?

30:41.898 --> 30:44.479
Of course I'm up for it.
I'm the frisco fly, right?

30:44.579 --> 30:45.579
Yeah.

30:46.724 --> 30:48.847
I don't have to climb anything, do I?

30:50.400 --> 30:51.400
Thank you.

30:59.453 --> 31:00.453
Disher.

31:00.765 --> 31:03.175
Lieutenant, I've tracked down
the vin number you gave us.

31:03.358 --> 31:06.908
- I got a name for you.
- Great. Hold on.

31:11.021 --> 31:13.460
- Okay. Shoot.
- His name is victor grajna.

31:14.125 --> 31:16.656
"V" as in "victor."
sorry.

31:16.756 --> 31:17.756
"V" as in what?

31:18.611 --> 31:20.362
"V" as in "victor."

31:20.856 --> 31:22.851
Sorry, I still can't hear you. "V" as in

31:22.984 --> 31:25.159
"V" as in what?
I know it's a "v," but "v" as in what?

31:25.274 --> 31:27.178
If you know it's a "v,"
what does it matter?

31:27.278 --> 31:29.747
Well, I just... I'd still like to know.
"V" as in what?

31:29.847 --> 31:31.851
- Why?
- Because that's how we do it.

31:31.951 --> 31:35.147
- Why?
- Just... Just say it. "V" as in what?

31:37.798 --> 31:39.098
That doesn't start with a "v."

31:40.995 --> 31:42.245
how are you doing?

31:42.548 --> 31:43.698
I feel good.

31:44.052 --> 31:46.881
- Never better. How are you doing?
- I'm okay.

31:47.252 --> 31:49.209
Don't you worry about me.

31:50.336 --> 31:54.326
You know, I'm pretty well acquainted
with all seven of the deadly sins,

31:55.677 --> 31:58.123
and I'd have to say that envy

31:58.634 --> 32:00.102
is the granddaddy sin.

32:00.202 --> 32:03.338
That's the one that causes
all the real problems out there.

32:03.878 --> 32:06.694
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm talking about you and krenshaw.

32:07.122 --> 32:09.619
You comparing yourself to him,
wanting what he has.

32:09.719 --> 32:11.624
What good is that doing you?

32:13.164 --> 32:16.752
Hey we gotta go. I just talked to randy.
He wants to show us something.

32:16.891 --> 32:18.016
No, thank you.

32:18.470 --> 32:21.020
Believe me, Mr. Monk,
you're gonna want to see this.

32:34.048 --> 32:35.048
Randy?

32:35.143 --> 32:37.552
The landlord let me in, so we're legal.

32:37.859 --> 32:39.174
But don't touch anything.

32:39.418 --> 32:42.073
Okay, I won't touch anything.

32:42.173 --> 32:43.173
Where'd you find this?

32:43.253 --> 32:44.266
Under the bed.

32:44.786 --> 32:45.786
Check this out.

32:47.481 --> 32:48.531
Look at this.

32:49.995 --> 32:51.845
A parachute, bright yellow.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.505
That's his trademark.

32:53.835 --> 32:55.002
Whose trademark?

32:55.683 --> 32:57.874
I think the guy who lived here
was the frisco fly.

32:57.974 --> 32:59.222
The real frisco fly.

33:00.205 --> 33:02.224
- Well, where is he?
- He's dead.

33:02.324 --> 33:04.749
Or at least I think he is.
Remember the burned-out car?

33:05.190 --> 33:06.456
I tracked the vin number.

33:06.556 --> 33:08.427
This guy owned it.
I think he was our driver.

33:08.527 --> 33:10.999
His name's, uh, victor grajna.

33:11.099 --> 33:13.894
I checked with immigration.
Guess what he did back in hungary?

33:13.994 --> 33:16.798
- Circus performer.
- Acrobat.

33:19.893 --> 33:21.043
What do you got?

33:25.976 --> 33:27.343
Coit tower...

33:29.538 --> 33:31.355
Golden gate bridge...

33:33.809 --> 33:35.326
Pacific electric building.

33:36.235 --> 33:38.969
Reconnaissance photos.
Before he climbed them.

33:39.069 --> 33:40.218
Wait a second.

33:40.984 --> 33:44.984
If this guy, victor grajna,
was the real frisco fly, what...

33:46.307 --> 33:49.107
What was harold krenshaw
doing on that roof?

33:49.950 --> 33:52.284
And how did he get into that costume?

33:52.490 --> 33:55.308
- You okay?
- Poison oak, that day in the woods.

33:58.006 --> 33:59.039
Poison oak?

33:59.536 --> 34:01.928
I didn't want to tell you.
It's not contagious.

34:09.900 --> 34:10.900
This is...

34:12.170 --> 34:13.570
This is wonderful!

34:13.772 --> 34:15.495
I know what happened!

34:15.723 --> 34:20.030
Harold krenshaw isn't the frisco fly.
He was never the frisco fly.

34:20.059 --> 34:21.389
Wait, it gets better.

34:21.693 --> 34:23.425
Somebody is trying to kill him.

34:25.542 --> 34:27.632
And shouldn't we
do something about that?

34:31.137 --> 34:33.373
I'll call it in.
What's this guy's name again?

34:33.942 --> 34:37.641
Grajna. "G" as in "gnome,"
"r" as in "randy Disher"...

34:37.839 --> 34:38.956
Mr. Monk.

34:39.728 --> 34:41.007
Your shoes are untied.

34:48.801 --> 34:50.685
Should we leave a note for dr. Franklin?

34:50.784 --> 34:51.784
Negative.

34:51.819 --> 34:54.255
The energy bar people want
to keep this on the hush-hush.

34:54.434 --> 34:55.400
Why?

34:55.447 --> 34:57.572
Show business reasons.
Don't worry about it.

34:58.499 --> 34:59.499
You okay?

34:59.513 --> 35:01.880
Well, it's kind of tight.

35:02.921 --> 35:03.988
You look great.

35:05.235 --> 35:07.660
- All right, let's go make some money.
- Yeah.

35:10.080 --> 35:11.163
Up?

35:11.296 --> 35:12.563
Change of plans.

35:12.663 --> 35:14.669
The energy bar people
want to shoot on the roof.

35:14.769 --> 35:15.794
The roof?

35:16.292 --> 35:18.309
Oh... Mmm...

35:20.360 --> 35:21.793
Oh, no. He's gone.

35:23.104 --> 35:24.104
Excuse me.

35:24.173 --> 35:26.004
Sfpd. We're looking for the frisco fly.

35:26.104 --> 35:27.403
He's not the frisco fly.

35:27.503 --> 35:29.913
He was just here.
He was with his cousin.

35:30.844 --> 35:31.944
His costume's gone.

35:32.642 --> 35:33.742
My god.

35:36.019 --> 35:38.465
Listen, joey, I gotta
tell you something.

35:38.565 --> 35:42.066
I... You gotta promise
not to tell anyone.

35:43.298 --> 35:45.290
I'm not the frisco fly.

35:45.390 --> 35:47.665
Oh. I gotta tell you something.

35:48.977 --> 35:49.977
I know.

35:50.082 --> 35:53.387
You two stay here. Randy, get some
back-up. Call hospital security.

35:53.441 --> 35:54.758
We're locking down this building.

35:54.796 --> 35:57.320
This is Disher. We got a possible 312.
Subject could be wearing

35:57.345 --> 35:58.795
a parachute and goggles.

36:00.029 --> 36:01.029
What?

36:01.305 --> 36:05.080
I don't think they'd go outside.
It's too risky. Harold's famous now.

36:05.513 --> 36:07.130
He'd be recognized.

36:07.793 --> 36:08.910
The roof.

36:09.039 --> 36:10.055
The roof.

36:10.788 --> 36:12.505
Come on, buddy.

36:12.645 --> 36:14.349
It's not as bad as it seems.

36:14.997 --> 36:16.916
All right, daredevil.

36:19.264 --> 36:21.967
Let's go wave to the people.
We need some witnesses.

36:23.193 --> 36:24.193
Uhh! do it!

36:27.513 --> 36:29.397
Hey, on the roof!

36:30.385 --> 36:32.485
Fly, fly, fly, fly!

36:33.484 --> 36:35.024
Sorry about this, cuz.

36:35.124 --> 36:38.131
Uncle ronnie said he's gonna
leave everything to you and me.

36:38.557 --> 36:41.391
As you rember, I never
was very good at sharing.

36:42.588 --> 36:43.805
Oh, a little extra.

36:44.193 --> 36:46.960
Last time, I don't think
I used quite enough.

36:49.583 --> 36:51.097
Come on, Mr. Monk.

36:51.197 --> 36:52.245
I can't.

36:52.965 --> 36:54.065
I can't.

36:57.328 --> 36:58.878
All right, this won't hurt.

36:59.572 --> 37:00.839
I promise.

37:18.985 --> 37:22.581
Harold! The gun, harold!
Grab the gun!

37:39.278 --> 37:41.128
Harold, are you okay?

37:42.420 --> 37:44.567
Yeah. I... I was just... I...

37:45.373 --> 37:46.731
I saw my fans down there.

37:47.082 --> 37:52.074
Thought I would climb down the building
and say hello, 'cause the frisco fly

37:52.399 --> 37:53.895
never disappoints his fans.

37:53.995 --> 37:55.805
Yeah, forget about it, harold.

37:56.242 --> 37:59.258
Give it a rest, okay?
The show's over.

38:01.027 --> 38:02.247
Here's what happened.

38:02.824 --> 38:04.890
Your cousin joey wanted you dead.

38:05.323 --> 38:08.168
I can think of five or six
reasons off the top of my head.

38:08.268 --> 38:10.016
Money. We have a rich uncle.

38:10.586 --> 38:12.946
He didn't want to share the estate.

38:13.113 --> 38:14.327
That's what I figured.

38:14.427 --> 38:16.646
Two weeks ago, joey's wish came true.

38:16.943 --> 38:20.222
There was an accident.
He happened to see it as he drove past.

38:20.547 --> 38:23.177
The driver's name was victor grajna.

38:23.567 --> 38:25.286
He was a professional acrobat.

38:25.386 --> 38:27.756
He was the real frisco fly.

38:29.085 --> 38:32.368
For Joey finding that costum
was like hitting the jackpot.

38:32.678 --> 38:34.545
2 Gallons of gazoline,

38:34.803 --> 38:39.065
one match and the real
Frisco fly was gone for ever.

38:44.284 --> 38:47.384
All joey had to do was wait
for the right moment.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.614
On monday night, he made his move.

38:50.323 --> 38:52.361
Where did it happen?
Was it at your house?

38:54.089 --> 38:55.834
It was in a parking garage.

38:57.808 --> 38:59.650
He dragged you up to the roof.

38:59.750 --> 39:02.499
It must have take him an hour
to get that costum on.

39:03.740 --> 39:06.266
They have to admit
it was a brilliant plan.

39:06.568 --> 39:09.918
Everyone would think the frisco fly
slipped and fell.

39:10.069 --> 39:12.963
It would have worked,
if you hadn't hit that awning.

39:13.079 --> 39:14.204
I don't understand.

39:14.304 --> 39:16.844
What did you think when you woke up?
In that costume?

39:17.031 --> 39:18.764
40 stories high?

39:19.483 --> 39:20.933
It was pretty confusing.

39:21.426 --> 39:25.176
It was a very confusing few minutes.

39:25.414 --> 39:29.434
It was probably the most confusing
two or three minutes of my life.

39:29.477 --> 39:30.887
Why didn't you tell anyone?

39:30.987 --> 39:32.394
Why didn't you say, "excuse me!

39:32.494 --> 39:34.264
Somebody just pushed me off the roof"?

39:34.364 --> 39:37.720
Because of me. He was
trying to drive me crazy.

39:38.106 --> 39:40.023
It wasn't you, Adrian.

39:40.873 --> 39:44.729
I know this is hard to understand,
but not everything is always about you.

39:46.358 --> 39:50.022
It's about my family, my little boy.

39:51.664 --> 39:53.375
He was so proud of me.

39:54.121 --> 39:56.688
Everybody was making such a fuss.

39:56.905 --> 39:58.924
I didn't know what had happened or why.

39:59.024 --> 40:02.342
I just... I knew that
it felt pretty good.

40:04.066 --> 40:05.083
Plus...

40:06.829 --> 40:09.129
It was driving you insane.

40:10.089 --> 40:12.339
Harold, he just saved your life.

40:14.782 --> 40:15.866
Thank you.

40:16.872 --> 40:17.872
Mr. Monk.

40:19.430 --> 40:20.563
You're welcome.

40:22.006 --> 40:23.172
Glad you're...

40:24.049 --> 40:25.049
Okay.

40:25.604 --> 40:27.888
- Enjoy your ineritance.
- Now I get it.

40:30.846 --> 40:32.513
This is about money, isn't it?

40:32.860 --> 40:35.013
Well, forget it.
There's no reward.

40:35.113 --> 40:38.299
What? He's not in this for the money!
You really are delusional!

40:38.355 --> 40:39.512
Go to hell, Teeger!

40:39.576 --> 40:41.476
- You go to hell!
- You can both go to hell!

40:41.509 --> 40:43.137
You go to hell! Not you.

40:44.663 --> 40:47.896
I will see you both
in dr. Kroger's office.

40:48.197 --> 40:52.597
And I hope that chuck and I
don't keep you waiting too long.

40:58.354 --> 41:00.993
- Harold!
- Is he... Is he...

41:01.049 --> 41:04.470
His parachute opened.
He's okay.

41:04.915 --> 41:06.299
Well, what's going on?

41:06.399 --> 41:08.654
Well, they're carrying him off

41:08.777 --> 41:10.443
on their shoulders.

41:10.583 --> 41:12.867
Because he broke his legs?

41:13.952 --> 41:15.373
I don't think so, Mr. Monk.

41:20.861 --> 41:22.311
can I go home now?

41:23.305 --> 41:29.242
