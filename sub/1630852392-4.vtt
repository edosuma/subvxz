WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:05.000
The warrant. Oh, this is just
surface, squeaky-clean and perfect.

00:05.000 --> 00:07.640
And what we're looking for
is in here somewhere.

00:07.640 --> 00:10.080
We found these in a hidden
safe in his workplace.

00:18.600 --> 00:20.720
This Hadi Mansour is not
giving up anything.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.640
So, right now, Fionn Brannigan

00:22.640 --> 00:24.320
is all we've got
to stop this bomb.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.720
I don't have you down
as a class of terrorist, Fionn.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.280
I think you lay down with dogs

00:28.280 --> 00:30.040
and got up with more
than you can handle.

00:30.040 --> 00:31.560
If they find
this other thing,

00:31.560 --> 00:32.960
I go to jail
for a really long time.

00:32.960 --> 00:34.360
I need you to destroy it.

00:36.400 --> 00:39.640
ALARM GOES OFF

00:36.400 --> 00:39.640
They caught me, the guards.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.160
It's a declaration of trust.

00:42.160 --> 00:45.120
And I need you
to get me out of here unseen.

00:45.120 --> 00:48.840
Siobhan... The hard drive.
They didn't get it.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.560
They've done it, James.
They've suspended my licence.

00:51.560 --> 00:53.080
Hey, they're just
following protocol.

00:53.080 --> 00:54.840
I have an ear I can bend.

00:54.840 --> 00:57.680
I think I might have
put you in danger.

00:57.680 --> 01:00.440
What sort of danger?
He's here, Emer.

01:00.440 --> 01:01.920
He's handing himself in.

01:01.920 --> 01:04.760
Something's not right.
He's not here.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.200
He was going
to take a deal?

01:19.200 --> 01:21.600
It's what the sister says.
You can ask for yourself.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.640
She's still here.
What do you think he has?

01:23.640 --> 01:24.720
We think he's laundering

01:24.720 --> 01:26.600
and crossed paths
somehow with the bombers.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.760
We think he wants
to give us that connection.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.280
Does it look like
someone got to him

01:30.280 --> 01:32.120
or he changed
his mind and ran?

01:32.120 --> 01:33.840
No sign of foul play.

01:33.840 --> 01:35.720
No-one entered the airport
who wasn't already

01:35.720 --> 01:37.720
on a passenger
or staff list.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.280
Most likely, he went over the
fence. We're looking at that.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.640
Can I take your bag?

01:42.640 --> 01:44.840
What about
outbound flights?

01:44.840 --> 01:48.000
Well, two in the timeframe.
One to Charleroi.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.080
We had it searched
on landing, nothing.

01:50.080 --> 01:52.480
And the other is a private
plane to Tangiers.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.200
Where he could
get beyond extradition.

01:54.200 --> 01:56.120
Yeah. Yeah, this is
where he was last seen.

01:56.120 --> 01:59.600
His sister left him there to get
her husband and the police.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.880
Any crew here that worked
for any of his companies?

02:03.880 --> 02:05.440
Could have
helped him get out?

02:05.440 --> 02:07.000
Vince is on that.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.480
And the contact list
his sister gave us.

02:08.480 --> 02:10.480
Follow me.

02:10.480 --> 02:13.320
What about the pilot
that brought him here?

02:13.320 --> 02:16.200
Admitted to smuggling him
on the cargo plane.

02:16.200 --> 02:18.240
Says he was threatened
with his job if he didn't.

02:18.240 --> 02:20.360
Ha! He'll be losing
a lot more than that now.

02:20.360 --> 02:22.320
We think he got help
getting to the airport.

02:22.320 --> 02:23.880
We're tracing that car.

02:23.880 --> 02:26.600
This is what
I want to show you.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.600
The fence wire
is pushed down.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.360
Hard to tell if it's even recent
and nowhere to lift a print.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.840
But he definitely
could have gone over it.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.680
If you come out
of the hangar,

02:35.680 --> 02:37.280
it's the first place
you'd try to hop.

02:37.280 --> 02:38.880
Good blind spot.

02:38.880 --> 02:40.960
Yeah, and the camera
is facing outwards.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.400
Yes, set up to get people
breaking in, not out.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.040
Also in his favour.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.400
He could be out
there now, running.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.880
We have search parties
and road checks for miles.

03:32.560 --> 03:33.760
Nothing yet.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.520
Frau Melnick, this is Detective
Sergeant Emer Berry

03:38.520 --> 03:41.160
from Ireland's
Criminal Assets Bureau.

03:41.160 --> 03:44.600
Why are CAB here?
We're looking for my brother.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.480
Yeah, well,
CAB got the information

03:46.480 --> 03:47.920
that can help us do that.

03:50.960 --> 03:54.160
Why did he come here to you,
Mrs Melnick?

03:56.440 --> 03:58.560
He wasn't making
much sense.

03:59.560 --> 04:02.000
He... Hmm...

04:02.000 --> 04:04.280
He said he was in danger

04:04.280 --> 04:06.480
and it would be
safer for him

04:06.480 --> 04:09.360
to talk to the police
and leave me out of it.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.040
He was coked
to the gills.

04:11.040 --> 04:12.840
I thought it was
mostly paranoia.

04:12.840 --> 04:16.280
Did he gave you any indication
what he wanted to tell us?

04:16.280 --> 04:18.440
No. I've no idea.

04:21.760 --> 04:25.200
I'd like to ask you again.

04:25.200 --> 04:28.760
Are you sure your
brother didn't know Sana Retz?

04:30.640 --> 04:33.000
He may have met her,
I don't remember.

04:34.720 --> 04:36.840
The last time Fionn
was here was when?

04:36.840 --> 04:38.880
Two months.

04:38.880 --> 04:40.760
Sana was in my employment then,

04:40.760 --> 04:43.320
but I don't remember
them meeting.

04:43.320 --> 04:46.560
He came to my office for lunch.
Maybe then, but...

04:46.560 --> 04:48.280
Why?

04:48.280 --> 04:50.720
He owns the apartment
where she was murdered.

04:50.720 --> 04:52.320
What?

04:52.320 --> 04:54.400
Wait, Fionn owned the apartment?

04:54.400 --> 04:56.800
I thought it was
this dealer...

04:56.800 --> 04:59.160
Darren Reid
fronted the purchase

04:59.160 --> 05:00.680
for your brother.

05:00.680 --> 05:03.240
Wait, that's...

05:03.240 --> 05:05.480
That's where the bomb was...

05:05.480 --> 05:08.800
Fionn, he wouldn't have
any involvement in that.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.320
No.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.120
How often
does he come to Antwerp?

05:14.120 --> 05:16.480
A couple of times a year.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.280
That's how often we see him.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.960
It's not the same as how often
he's here, I suppose.

05:20.960 --> 05:23.640
You didn't know he had
acquired property here?

05:23.640 --> 05:27.240
No. He'd know
I wouldn't be pleased.

05:27.240 --> 05:30.400
Look, it doesn't surprise me
that Fionn is on CAB's radar,

05:30.400 --> 05:32.560
but this...

05:32.560 --> 05:35.000
..this sounds like
what he was running from.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.240
He was really scared.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.000
Please, just find him.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.160
Well, that's what
we're trying to do. Thank you.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.120
You think
she's telling us everything?

06:07.120 --> 06:10.120
Her employee at the apartment,
her brother owns it.

06:12.120 --> 06:14.360
She's been fully
cooperating.

06:14.360 --> 06:16.560
And background checks threw nothing
up.

06:19.120 --> 06:21.400
There is, however,
a line of inquiry into him.

06:22.480 --> 06:25.360
James Melnick's law firm
represented a company

06:25.360 --> 06:28.040
accused of shipping illegal
chemicals to Syria.

06:29.400 --> 06:33.040
Isopropanol. Used in the
production of sarin nerve gas.

06:33.040 --> 06:35.120
And the company
had no export licence.

06:35.120 --> 06:36.960
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

06:35.120 --> 06:36.960
He lost the case

06:36.960 --> 06:39.640
and appears to have had no
contact with the company since.

06:39.640 --> 06:43.040
That was seven
or eight years ago.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.160
Yeah?

06:49.200 --> 06:51.320
OK.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.440
Plane to Tangiers just landed.
Four passengers.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.840
One pilot, one crew.
They're all females.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.960
I want a fucking cigarette.

07:01.960 --> 07:04.160
You smoke?

07:04.160 --> 07:07.160
Well... I'm trying to quit.
Got a patch.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.120
Yeah. You're very calm.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.680
I cheat. Got one
over here as well.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.240
Do you have a spare?

07:16.240 --> 07:17.640
Sure do.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.240
Oh, thank you!

07:20.240 --> 07:22.080
I've got gum too.

07:22.080 --> 07:25.200
So maybe Fionn Brannigan
changed his mind. I wonder why.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.400
I just don't want
to hear that more people

07:27.400 --> 07:29.640
have been blown up
before we find him.

07:29.640 --> 07:31.760
Yeah.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.840
Been looking at that apartment
on the news all week.

07:50.880 --> 07:52.560
It was owned by your brother.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.280
And how...how does he get
himself mixed up

07:58.280 --> 08:00.600
with people
who blow people up?

08:01.920 --> 08:03.880
You know what I don't get?

08:05.160 --> 08:07.400
How does Sana fit
into all of this?

08:07.400 --> 08:09.960
Hmm? Huh! Pretty girl.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.640
Catches his eye. Drugs?

08:11.640 --> 08:14.000
He might be dead.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.800
No...

08:17.800 --> 08:20.600
No, he scrapes his way
out of everything.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.200
I'm sure he knows
plenty of shady people

08:23.200 --> 08:24.600
who can help him run.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.120
Plus, he knows the airport.

08:26.120 --> 08:29.000
If he was OK, he would've
called me or Siobhan by now.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.560
It's only been a few hours.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.560
I should have made him
come with me.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.000
The state he was in.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.120
No... Hey...

08:53.400 --> 08:54.960
He'll be back.

08:59.280 --> 09:02.320
He'll be back to give us plenty
more sleepless nights.

09:05.160 --> 09:06.920
I'd take them.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.880
SIREN WAILS

10:51.480 --> 10:53.240
What the fuck?!

10:53.240 --> 10:54.640
Hey!

11:28.480 --> 11:30.040
CROWD SHOUTS

13:06.920 --> 13:08.600
Yes?
I have an appointment.

13:08.600 --> 13:10.360
I phoned earlier. Thank you.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.600
The Irish police again.

13:15.600 --> 13:18.040
What? You fell out
with your Belgian partner?

13:23.440 --> 13:26.800
How would I verify if these
come from the same source?

13:26.800 --> 13:29.120
Read the accompanying
paperwork.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.760
They're from the same mine.

13:34.760 --> 13:36.440
You can tell,
just like that?

13:36.440 --> 13:39.320
Hmm... Blue.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.360
Both exposed to boron
during formation.

13:42.360 --> 13:44.440
Rare.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.040
Expensive.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.640
And they have
the same-shaped atoms.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.920
Expressed
in their outward shape.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.880
Round now because the edges
are worn, but look.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.760
12 faces.

13:55.760 --> 13:57.520
Hmm...

13:57.520 --> 14:00.680
Everything comes
to the surface eventually.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.680
To answer your question,
it is highly unlikely

14:02.680 --> 14:05.560
that two people in Ireland have
these stones by coincidence.

14:05.560 --> 14:06.760
Hang on, I didn't say...

14:06.760 --> 14:08.600
You're not the first cop
to ever come in here.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.280
To ask me about
illegal diamonds.

14:10.280 --> 14:12.160
It happens all the time.

14:15.440 --> 14:16.960
Have you seen this man?

14:16.960 --> 14:19.280
His name
is Fionn Brannigan.

14:19.280 --> 14:22.120
You, I remembered
straight off. Him, I never saw.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.880
Looking is what I do.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.240
But I tell you, these are
no good to him like this.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.360
They have to be cut
and polished.

14:29.360 --> 14:32.000
And they can't without
a Kimberley.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.480
He needs someone disreputable
to do that and certify them.

14:34.480 --> 14:36.720
And your friend has beautiful
laundered diamonds.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.920
Someone like that is
who I'd be looking for.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.920
Where?

14:40.920 --> 14:43.440
Anywhere in the world with
an exploited work force

14:43.440 --> 14:44.920
or a system open to bribes.

14:44.920 --> 14:47.960
China, Russia,
India, Africa.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.440
So, anywhere?

14:49.440 --> 14:51.520
Hmm.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.320
Have you got anything
on the Audi?

15:54.320 --> 15:57.280
CCTV footage
is a complete wash-out.

15:57.280 --> 16:01.040
No match on either the guest
list or the staff list. Nothing.

16:01.040 --> 16:03.240
And Emer, we can see the car
pull out onto the road

16:03.240 --> 16:05.000
then it literally disappears.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.040
Nothing on the next camera
in either direction.

16:07.040 --> 16:10.040
We're probably chasing
our tails here but keep at it.

16:10.040 --> 16:12.560
Will do.
Put Norah on.

16:12.560 --> 16:14.440
She's not here yet.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.880
OK, I'll talk to you later.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.640
Double-shot espresso.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Thought you might need it.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.520
How are the boys?

16:28.520 --> 16:31.000
Huge. I have
to scold upwards.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.880
Ha-ha! Brian?

16:34.880 --> 16:38.040
The way your team's been
in the headlines lately,

16:38.040 --> 16:41.480
you didn't bring me here
to ask about my family.

16:41.480 --> 16:44.080
I need to know everything
Revenue has on Brannigan.

16:44.080 --> 16:47.280
Hmm! You know what we know.
You've seen what's in the files.

16:47.280 --> 16:50.520
But what I really want
is what isn't in the files.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.080
What's in your head.
What makes you think...

16:53.080 --> 16:55.760
You wouldn't stop digging
on a scumbag that big.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.800
He is scum.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.920
Maybe posh scum
with a tan on a yacht,

17:00.920 --> 17:02.960
but every penny is diddled from
the Irish taxpayer,

17:02.960 --> 17:04.840
so real scum.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.360
What can you tell me?

17:08.360 --> 17:10.160
Without clearance?

17:11.760 --> 17:13.240
SHE LAUGHS

17:17.160 --> 17:19.320
You think I don't know
why I'm here, Norah?

17:19.320 --> 17:21.160
Sorry.

17:21.160 --> 17:24.400
Sorry, but I really want
to get the little fucker.

17:24.400 --> 17:27.320
The rules are the reason
we didn't get the little fucker.

17:28.360 --> 17:29.800
We're too bloody slow.

17:31.280 --> 17:33.120
We'd over a decade

17:33.120 --> 17:35.800
to recover what him and
his father hid from the state.

17:36.840 --> 17:40.960
Revenue doesn't want
the real figure out there.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.360
But the Brannigans
must have hidden 600 million.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.600
Say 5% compound on that.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.760
Makes 400 million
tax free.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.320
Shit!

17:49.320 --> 17:51.560
It's an obscene
amount of money.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.880
I've hardly had the time.

17:53.880 --> 17:56.680
I just can't break
through his books.

17:56.680 --> 17:59.160
I really need a steer.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.680
OK.

18:06.080 --> 18:07.600
Surat.What?

18:08.840 --> 18:10.760
Fionn Brannigan tried
to put three properties

18:10.760 --> 18:13.480
beyond our reach at the time
his father topped himself.

18:13.480 --> 18:14.720
We got two of them.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.040
You wouldn't believe
what we had to go through

18:17.040 --> 18:18.680
in Moscow and in India.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.200
Not just twists and turns,
but real threats

18:21.200 --> 18:24.480
from Brannigan's
new-found friends and partners.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.760
But there was something in Surat
too that we didn't get.

18:26.760 --> 18:28.840
He was travelling in and out
of there the whole time,

18:28.840 --> 18:30.360
and we don't know why.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.960
You think that asset
is still there?

18:31.960 --> 18:33.760
Something is.

18:33.760 --> 18:35.520
Surat.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.560
That's where I'd be looking.

19:03.360 --> 19:05.440
Any word?No.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.800
You look exhausted, Bibi.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.960
You really need
to be here?

19:11.960 --> 19:14.160
If I'm at work,
I don't have to think.

19:18.280 --> 19:19.760
What are you doing here?

19:19.760 --> 19:21.240
I was on my way
to meet a client.

19:21.240 --> 19:23.000
Thought I would drop in.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.920
You're not just
doing admin, are you?

19:27.920 --> 19:30.680
I saw your vans heading down
to the docks as I drove in.

19:30.680 --> 19:32.600
I was going to tell you
last night but...

19:34.440 --> 19:36.840
Richard got the suspension
lifted.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.520
What?

19:39.680 --> 19:42.120
You know him.
He always has to fix things.

19:42.120 --> 19:44.760
He has to know that
they're broken, first.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.520
It's just until the hearing.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.440
Wait, you went
behind my back?

19:48.440 --> 19:50.600
This is my area of the law

19:50.600 --> 19:52.160
and you would rather
take his advice?

19:52.160 --> 19:53.640
If I have to close until the
hearing,

19:53.640 --> 19:55.080
I could lose half my business.

19:55.080 --> 19:56.600
If you bend the rules, Bibi,

19:56.600 --> 19:58.160
you could lose
all your business.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.760
Which is why I counselled
you as I did.

20:00.840 --> 20:03.160
You hired an illegal, OK?
That isn't nothing.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.840
These people could bring
their full weight down on you

20:05.840 --> 20:07.440
if they want to.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.880
I know them and
they're not going to like

20:09.880 --> 20:12.120
you pulling their strings.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.640
This could really backfire.

20:13.640 --> 20:16.120
James! James!

20:16.120 --> 20:19.440
What should I do?
Ask my father.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.360
Detective Sergeant Berry,
please come take a look at this.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.960
This... This dark grey Volvo.

20:39.240 --> 20:40.800
This is the road
behind the airport.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.840
The hangar where
Fionn Brannigan was.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.600
Nothing unusual.

20:44.600 --> 20:47.360
Only, the same car passes

20:47.360 --> 20:49.360
at the exact same spot
nine minutes later,

20:49.360 --> 20:51.280
but in the opposite direction.

20:51.280 --> 20:53.280
But this is a no-through road.

20:53.280 --> 20:55.720
So there's nowhere to go
or come back from in that time.

20:55.720 --> 20:57.920
So it stopped
and had business.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.440
Yes.
Nine minutes.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.480
That's enough time for him
to jump the fence

21:02.480 --> 21:04.400
and that car to drive him away.

21:04.400 --> 21:06.080
We picked it back up
on the airport road.

21:07.120 --> 21:09.680
And we have much
better cameras there.

21:09.680 --> 21:11.840
We have the licence plate.

21:13.160 --> 21:14.600
And we have the address.

21:16.920 --> 21:19.280
OK. Let's go.

21:20.320 --> 21:23.280
Oh, chief,
forensics are here.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.600
Dr Marianne Baert,
Head of Forensics,

21:27.600 --> 21:29.360
this is Detective
Sergeant Emer Berry.

21:29.360 --> 21:31.600
Hi! From Ireland.
I've heard about you. Welcome!

21:31.600 --> 21:34.360
Christian, we have managed
to extract a sample of DNA

21:34.360 --> 21:36.120
from the explosive device.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.600
And Interpol have a match.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.800
The bomber?
Yes.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.720
But it doesn't make sense.

21:41.720 --> 21:44.160
The match says he's Colombian.

21:44.160 --> 21:45.680
He's what?

21:45.680 --> 21:47.480
DNA from an explosion
is notoriously

21:47.480 --> 21:49.240
difficult to extract.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.600
Any sample
potentially contains DNA

21:51.600 --> 21:53.160
from 15 different people.

21:53.160 --> 21:54.880
But we rechecked every step.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.320
Colombian, you say?

21:56.320 --> 21:57.760
Hmm-hmm.

21:57.760 --> 22:00.120
Makes no sense at all.

22:00.120 --> 22:02.320
Makes sense for him
blessing himself.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.560
Narcotic-funded terrorism?

22:06.400 --> 22:09.600
And the cartels aren't
exactly unknown here.

22:09.600 --> 22:13.480
And drugs would link in with
Darren Reid and Fionn Brannigan.

22:13.480 --> 22:15.080
Hold on, I thought
we were investigating

22:15.080 --> 22:16.920
an Islamic terrorist attack.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.720
We're investigating
a terrorist attack.

22:19.720 --> 22:22.800
Interpol have requested
the release of his particulars.

22:22.800 --> 22:26.320
So the Colombian Ambassador
will be expecting you.

22:26.320 --> 22:27.920
Thank you. Let's go.

22:36.720 --> 22:40.000
So, you've ruled out
ISIS, then?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.280
Yeah, well, it doesn't smell right.

22:42.280 --> 22:44.800
They haven't claimed it.
We have no intel.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.600
This cell just appeared
out of nowhere.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.560
So either these guys
are dangerously good

22:49.560 --> 22:51.400
or the men we hauled in

22:51.400 --> 22:53.520
have absolutely
nothing to do with it.

22:53.520 --> 22:55.520
I'm keeping
my options open.

23:29.680 --> 23:31.400
Chief Inspector De Jong?

23:31.400 --> 23:33.960
Detective Sergeant Berry. Welcome.

23:33.960 --> 23:36.800
My office has sent through
everything you asked for.

23:36.800 --> 23:39.040
Let me know if you need
anything else.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.320
Maybe something to eat?

23:40.320 --> 23:42.160
No, thank you. OK. Bye.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.880
Luis Eduardo Spinola.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.560
Born in Bogota, 1978.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.280
Parole denied.

23:56.600 --> 23:59.200
Two counts of burglary, assault,

23:59.200 --> 24:00.720
four counts of armed robbery.

24:02.440 --> 24:06.400
No drug-related offences,
and no known drug affiliations.

24:06.400 --> 24:09.480
This guy doesn't seem to have any
connections to the drugs at all.

24:11.840 --> 24:14.280
Doesn't look right.

24:14.280 --> 24:15.720
Because it's not.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.080
It's not him.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.320
"Se ahorca".

24:23.320 --> 24:25.440
Hung himself.

24:25.440 --> 24:27.760
Spinola can't be the Antwerp bomber.

24:27.760 --> 24:31.120
He died in La Modelo prison
four weeks ago.

24:33.040 --> 24:34.880
This fucking case.

24:37.240 --> 24:40.080
What are we even doing here?

24:40.080 --> 24:41.640
There must be a mix-up.

24:46.200 --> 24:48.360
NEWSCASTER: Live in Antwerp
this evening.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.720
We spoke to members of
the public voicing fears that,

24:50.720 --> 24:53.880
despite police questioning of
four suspects detained yesterday

24:53.880 --> 24:56.680
in the 2060 district,
no charges have yet been brought.

24:56.680 --> 24:59.360
Chief Inspector Christian De Jong
of the Counter Terrorism Unit

24:59.360 --> 25:00.640
has declined to comment.

25:00.640 --> 25:02.400
And the predominant fear is that

25:02.400 --> 25:04.720
whoever is mounting this
campaign is...

25:04.720 --> 25:06.400
Give me a minute.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.320
I need a cigarette.

25:26.240 --> 25:27.840
Don't do it.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.760
PHONE RINGS

26:09.200 --> 26:10.920
Same registration.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.880
They cloned the fucking plates.

26:16.120 --> 26:17.360
Fuck!

26:30.480 --> 26:33.000
Not a single hit.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.800
No leads to a hotel or
a business park.

26:35.800 --> 26:38.720
Any commercial property, nothing.

26:38.720 --> 26:41.640
No mention of Surat in any
of his correspondence, either.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.560
No-one is taking our jobs.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.400
That's what he wants you to believe.

27:22.680 --> 27:25.000
Viktor Maes,
a right-wing politician.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.880
Cynical, profiteering low-life

27:27.880 --> 27:30.600
using the bombings to stir up
racial hatred for votes.

27:36.440 --> 27:38.520
But they are taking our jobs.

27:43.360 --> 27:46.720
My wife, she's been looking for
a job for eight months now.

27:46.720 --> 27:48.000
Eight months? Yeah?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.560
Well, she's not going to be too
happy when you lose yours.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.040
Dark grey Volvo.

27:58.040 --> 27:59.560
Right reg.

27:59.560 --> 28:01.560
Sitting all night in a
disused car park.

28:08.640 --> 28:10.640
He took seven flights
to Surat that year,

28:10.640 --> 28:12.120
and no attempts to hide them.

28:12.120 --> 28:15.240
But I can't find any, no evidence
of what he was doing there.

28:15.240 --> 28:17.560
No sign of any
high-yielding properties.

28:17.560 --> 28:20.760
No leads to... Hold on.
Seven trips to Surat, in India?

28:20.760 --> 28:22.480
They cut diamonds big time there.

28:23.640 --> 28:26.240
If those raw diamonds
were illegal..."If"?

28:26.240 --> 28:28.880
We found some in
the bottom of a monkey cage.

28:28.880 --> 28:31.600
Norah, this sounds
completely dodgy.

28:31.600 --> 28:32.640
He was laundering.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.960
We're looking for a place
that cuts diamonds.

28:34.960 --> 28:36.320
I'm on it.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.600
Do you know how many of those
there are in Surat?

28:44.600 --> 28:46.800
Most diamonds go through there.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.800
Hey, Marianne.

28:49.800 --> 28:51.200
Hi.

28:51.200 --> 28:54.120
So, all this.

28:54.120 --> 28:57.640
And whoever we're looking for
was probably wearing gloves.

28:57.640 --> 29:01.120
Oh, Jesus, it's like someone
tipped a bin into it.

29:01.120 --> 29:02.880
It's that one over there.

29:02.880 --> 29:06.040
Are you kidding me?
No, it's DNA soup in here.

29:06.040 --> 29:09.160
I mean, we have four different
colours of hair already -

29:09.160 --> 29:10.880
and that's just human hair.

29:10.880 --> 29:13.880
Tissues, plastic cutlery, straws...

29:13.880 --> 29:16.960
So, no matches any time soon? No.

29:16.960 --> 29:19.840
Any sign of blood? Minimal.

29:19.840 --> 29:22.640
Consistent with minor
cuts and scrapes.

29:22.640 --> 29:25.840
And, judging by the grade,
yeah, it's mostly old.

29:25.840 --> 29:28.760
Any sign of a struggle? None.

29:28.760 --> 29:31.560
Good. And if he were dead,
why take him?

29:31.560 --> 29:33.160
All the roadblocks last night,

29:33.160 --> 29:35.160
these guys would've had
to switch cars.

29:36.160 --> 29:38.640
Let's see if any cars were
stolen from here.

29:38.640 --> 29:40.240
Or they were met here.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.600
I'll spare you the agony, Christian.

29:44.600 --> 29:47.040
The wires are all cut. Every one.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.480
Sure. Of course they are.

29:51.240 --> 29:52.880
Dead end? Yeah.

29:52.880 --> 29:55.720
Well, I'm giving Emer a
fucking tour of them.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.280
I'll expedite what I can here.

29:59.280 --> 30:02.880
Are you still double-checking
the DNA of the bomber? Mm-hm.

30:02.880 --> 30:04.360
That wasn't our guy.

30:04.360 --> 30:07.680
He died in a Colombian prison
just under a month ago.

30:07.680 --> 30:10.320
OK. Ohh, yes...

30:10.320 --> 30:12.480
..so, we'll keep checking.

30:12.480 --> 30:14.880
But this is very strange. Come on.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.400
Thanks, Marianne.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.240
This is a needle in a haystack.

30:24.240 --> 30:27.800
There are hundred of diamond
polishing houses in Surat.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.840
I still can't join the dots.

30:29.840 --> 30:33.200
Well, Revenue, they couldn't find
a connection in ten years.

30:33.200 --> 30:35.920
Do you really think we can now?

30:35.920 --> 30:38.400
Not if we keep looking for it
the same way they did.

30:39.480 --> 30:41.480
We need to find a different way.

30:44.240 --> 30:46.480
Antwerp.

30:46.480 --> 30:48.680
The Revenue never had
reason to look there.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.200
It's only popped up recently.

30:50.200 --> 30:53.280
And it's the obvious place for
him to be getting raw diamonds,

30:53.280 --> 30:55.280
or moving them through to Surat.

30:56.840 --> 30:58.600
Antwerp.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.520
OK, let's start again.

31:00.520 --> 31:02.160
OK, cool.

31:10.880 --> 31:14.240
PHONE RINGS

31:14.240 --> 31:16.080
Yep? Sean, what is it?

31:16.080 --> 31:19.240
We found the Audi we thought
Fionn Brannigan maybe escaped in.

31:19.240 --> 31:20.960
This sounds like bad news.

31:22.040 --> 31:24.280
We didn't get it on any street CCTV

31:24.280 --> 31:26.840
because it drove straight
under the ground again.

31:26.840 --> 31:29.480
Into the shopping centre next door.

31:29.480 --> 31:33.520
It belongs to two teachers from
Galway who were having an affair.

31:33.520 --> 31:35.320
Go, Galway.

31:35.320 --> 31:37.800
So, Siobhan was definitely lying.

31:37.800 --> 31:40.040
If he didn't exit
the car park, Sean,

31:40.040 --> 31:41.960
the chances are he didn't enter.

31:41.960 --> 31:43.440
The logical conclusion here

31:43.440 --> 31:45.920
is that he was never
in the Strand Restaurant at all.

31:45.920 --> 31:48.160
That you lost him en route.

31:48.160 --> 31:50.920
So, Siobhan Brannigan didn't
go there for someone

31:50.920 --> 31:52.640
to rescue her husband.

31:52.640 --> 31:54.280
He was already gone.

31:54.280 --> 31:57.320
She knew the document was there
and went to get it.

31:57.320 --> 31:59.680
Fionn was a regular,
and he could've hidden...

32:00.840 --> 32:02.680
Shit.

32:02.680 --> 32:05.120
That's why she was in the...

32:05.120 --> 32:08.160
Get a search warrant, Sean.
Search the men's toilets.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.760
See if there's anything else there.

32:09.760 --> 32:10.800
Yes, boss.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.120
Where are you headed?

32:13.120 --> 32:15.560
I've gone through every hospital
admission in the country,

32:15.560 --> 32:18.360
but no luck. So, maybe I'm scraping
the bottom of the barrel,

32:18.360 --> 32:20.360
but I'm heading south.

32:20.360 --> 32:22.360
South? Local PD called it in.

32:22.360 --> 32:24.640
A guy out walking his dog
found a body.

32:24.640 --> 32:26.360
Bit of a mess, no ID.

32:27.480 --> 32:30.560
And you think this might be
Fionn Brannigan because...?

32:30.560 --> 32:33.280
Same height. Ish.

32:33.280 --> 32:35.360
Found close to Charleroi.

32:35.360 --> 32:37.800
Caucasian, brown hair,
platinum wedding band,

32:37.800 --> 32:39.640
Louis Copeland suit...

32:39.640 --> 32:40.880
Shit.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.960
It's him. What?

32:44.960 --> 32:47.160
Louis Copeland -
it's the suit of choice for

32:47.160 --> 32:50.360
the wealthy businessman in Ireland.

32:50.360 --> 32:52.560
It's him.

32:52.560 --> 32:54.040
OK.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.640
Tell them we're coming, Vince.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.480
I'm coming with you. No, you're not.

34:18.320 --> 34:21.800
OK. How did you end up here?

34:24.200 --> 34:26.080
So, do you think it's him?

34:28.560 --> 34:30.280
It's him.

34:46.840 --> 34:48.280
And here!

34:54.280 --> 34:55.960
It's radiating everywhere.

34:57.840 --> 34:59.520
That blood here.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.520
And over there.

35:02.520 --> 35:06.360
You'd expect that would be in a
straightforward trajectory, but...

35:08.840 --> 35:11.480
AIRPLANE OVERHEAD

35:13.440 --> 35:15.920
Oh, God. Fuck!

35:17.360 --> 35:19.600
The plane that left
for Charleroi last night

35:19.600 --> 35:21.320
would've passed right over here.

35:21.320 --> 35:24.560
We're about seven kilometres
from the airport, just about

35:24.560 --> 35:27.000
where the landing gear comes down.

35:28.280 --> 35:30.120
Maybe he was trying to escape?

35:32.760 --> 35:35.200
Or maybe there's a bullet
in the back of his head.

35:40.440 --> 35:43.720
Sorry, could you just...
turn him ever so slightly?

35:45.680 --> 35:47.960
Hard to tell if that's a
bullet wound or not.

35:47.960 --> 35:50.680
We'll have to wait for
the forensics report.

35:50.680 --> 35:51.840
Damn!

36:11.760 --> 36:13.160
A guy like that, Emer,

36:13.160 --> 36:15.040
was always going to meet
a bad ending.

36:19.160 --> 36:21.760
I wanted answers from him.

36:28.240 --> 36:30.720
RETCHING

37:13.200 --> 37:15.720
Erm, I'm going to have
to call Siobhan, and...

37:15.720 --> 37:17.600
I called. I called her.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.800
What did she say?

37:19.800 --> 37:22.040
Thank you for telling her.

37:22.040 --> 37:24.840
I mean, what can you say?

37:24.840 --> 37:26.840
Still. I need to call her.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.080
What shall I say?

37:30.080 --> 37:31.480
I don't know.

37:31.480 --> 37:33.080
Just listen, I guess.

37:35.360 --> 37:37.240
Here.

37:37.240 --> 37:38.880
Dropped from a plane.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.800
Do you think he was alive?

37:43.800 --> 37:45.600
No. No, no.

37:46.680 --> 37:49.320
Who would do something like that?

37:49.320 --> 37:51.440
Here, it'll help. No.

37:57.760 --> 37:59.800
I've sent my plane for her.

38:01.240 --> 38:04.040
For Siobhan? Mm-hm.
She's coming tonight?

38:07.640 --> 38:10.000
I thought I could do
something that would help.

38:16.400 --> 38:20.080
The police need somebody
to formally ID the body.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.240
I said I would go.

38:26.800 --> 38:29.760
We're not going to be able
to make arrangements yet, are we?

38:29.760 --> 38:31.480
Not yet, no.

38:31.480 --> 38:35.880
It's probably going to be a couple
of weeks before they release...

38:35.880 --> 38:38.000
Before they...

38:38.000 --> 38:39.640
Look, I know somebody I could call.

38:39.640 --> 38:41.040
No, we got it.

38:43.680 --> 38:45.120
Thank you.

38:46.720 --> 38:49.160
Oh, my God!

38:49.160 --> 38:51.120
The children.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.680
How do you tell your children
something like that?

38:56.040 --> 38:58.400
What if they ever see photographs?

39:02.000 --> 39:04.720
I didn't even return
his calls yesterday.

39:04.720 --> 39:06.960
Bibi...

39:06.960 --> 39:08.920
You've always been there for him.

39:08.920 --> 39:11.960
PHONE RINGS

39:08.920 --> 39:11.960
Always.

39:13.800 --> 39:15.640
You did everything you could.

39:15.640 --> 39:17.840
RINGING CONTINUES

39:17.840 --> 39:19.440
Yeah, it's me.

39:19.440 --> 39:22.040
He couldn't have asked for
a better sister than you.

39:32.560 --> 39:34.280
PHONE RINGS

39:35.480 --> 39:37.680
Yeah. Hey, Sean.
You got your warrant.

39:37.680 --> 39:41.200
Someone's running it up to you now.
Thank you.

39:41.200 --> 39:43.680
Search warrant's just been issued
for the River Restaurant.

39:43.680 --> 39:45.120
Brilliant.

39:48.440 --> 39:49.680
Hey.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.320
Red.

40:02.440 --> 40:04.600
What have you got, Norah? Look.

40:06.480 --> 40:08.560
I'm looking. What am I seeing?

40:10.040 --> 40:12.760
Senne van Eyck?

40:12.760 --> 40:15.240
All these companies used him.

40:16.360 --> 40:17.640
And here.

40:20.800 --> 40:22.960
And here, too.

40:22.960 --> 40:25.720
This guy is everywhere.
Aircraft insurance.

40:25.720 --> 40:27.320
An insurance underwriter?

40:27.320 --> 40:30.760
I was expecting a fixer,
or a dodgy lawyer.

40:30.760 --> 40:32.720
Looks like he's hiding
in plain sight.

40:35.560 --> 40:38.480
That's what makes him
valuable to us.

40:38.480 --> 40:41.120
Because Fionn overlooked him.

40:41.120 --> 40:42.760
He overused him.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.480
Norah.

40:51.480 --> 40:54.360
He was an underwriter on the
hotel in Moscow, too.

40:54.360 --> 40:56.240
The one Revenue recovered.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.600
And the business park in Bulgaria.

41:01.600 --> 41:04.680
This means there's a good chance
that Fionn Brannigan might have

41:04.680 --> 41:06.200
used him in Surat, as well.

41:06.200 --> 41:08.720
If we get to this
Senne van Eyck's files,

41:08.720 --> 41:12.400
and find a company in Surat
he might have done business with,

41:12.400 --> 41:14.080
we might get to Fionn.

41:14.080 --> 41:17.160
Cos the insurance will have
required full disclosure.

41:36.360 --> 41:38.400
Christian!

41:38.400 --> 41:39.920
You were right.

41:41.320 --> 41:43.560
Your victim was on that plane.

41:43.560 --> 41:45.800
Blood found in the left
wheel-well is a match.

41:45.800 --> 41:49.040
Here, gunshot to the head. OK.

41:49.040 --> 41:52.680
Why, though? Why not just
leave him there in the hangar?

41:54.160 --> 41:57.040
So we would waste all this time
looking for him and not them.

41:57.040 --> 41:59.320
Not a bomber.

41:59.320 --> 42:02.560
Did they leave anything?
No, only the bullets.

42:02.560 --> 42:05.960
They're from a Glock. See?

42:05.960 --> 42:07.600
Here.

42:07.600 --> 42:09.480
Same weapon that killed
Darren Reid.

42:11.200 --> 42:14.720
These guys have got to be
someone's private little army.

42:14.720 --> 42:17.760
Someone with serious money,
serious range. Not ISIS.

42:17.760 --> 42:19.680
They've got their own foot soldiers.

42:19.680 --> 42:22.520
But made to look like ISIS.

42:22.520 --> 42:26.160
This case keeps going in
too many directions.

42:26.160 --> 42:28.600
You're not going to like this, then.

42:28.600 --> 42:31.320
The DNA we extracted from
the Antwerp bomb -

42:31.320 --> 42:34.640
it does belong to the prisoner
who died in Bogota.

42:34.640 --> 42:39.640
What? Yeah. We reran the tests
with a fresh sample. It's him.

42:39.640 --> 42:43.560
How can he be dead on the other side
of the world, and here, in Antwerp?

42:43.560 --> 42:45.160
He wasn't dead.

42:46.520 --> 42:48.920
DNA doesn't lie.

42:48.920 --> 42:50.480
OK, but how...?

42:50.480 --> 42:53.480
Someone faked his death and
got him out of the prison.

42:53.480 --> 42:55.960
Why would an escaped Colombian
prisoner come over here

42:55.960 --> 42:58.280
and blow himself up?I don't know.

42:58.280 --> 43:02.480
Someone might've been threatening
his family or offered a fee,

43:02.480 --> 43:05.200
or he had a debt to pay.

43:05.200 --> 43:07.960
Any number of reasons.

43:07.960 --> 43:10.560
He was doing life and denied parole.

43:10.560 --> 43:12.440
He could've been persuaded.

43:13.720 --> 43:16.600
And, Christian,
the Brussels bomber -

43:16.600 --> 43:18.360
he could be Colombian, too.

43:25.400 --> 43:31.280
So, this Spinola guy died 11 days
before the Antwerp bombing.

43:31.280 --> 43:33.920
We need to find out if any other
prisoners died in the same

43:33.920 --> 43:36.280
sort of timeframe
before the Brussels bomb.

43:36.280 --> 43:39.080
Yes. Mm-hm. We need to go back
to the Colombian Embassy.

43:41.600 --> 43:43.560
OK, let's go.

43:43.560 --> 43:44.840
Thanks, Marianne!

44:15.080 --> 44:17.720
DOG WHINES

44:46.000 --> 44:47.200
Just some coke.

44:50.880 --> 44:52.600
So, he did have a hidey hole.

45:03.880 --> 45:05.320
Shit.

45:09.920 --> 45:11.840
Nothing else there.

45:27.360 --> 45:29.000
TEARFULLY: I'm so sorry.

45:33.360 --> 45:36.160
QUIET SOBBING

45:59.400 --> 46:01.200
ENGINE IGNITES

46:18.160 --> 46:20.360
Thank you for waiting, detectives.

46:23.040 --> 46:25.160
Four inmates who died
in the last two months

46:25.160 --> 46:27.120
in La Modelo prison.

46:27.120 --> 46:28.640
What records there are.

46:28.640 --> 46:31.960
They aren't exactly known for
their record-keeping at La Modelo.

46:31.960 --> 46:34.440
OK. Thank you. You're welcome.

46:34.440 --> 46:36.520
Thank you.

46:36.520 --> 46:37.880
HE CLEARS THROAT

46:45.560 --> 46:46.960
No.

46:51.400 --> 46:54.040
Blinded in a knife attack. No.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.600
Autopsy pictures -
definitely dead.

47:02.600 --> 47:04.040
Wait a minute.

47:04.040 --> 47:05.360
This guy.

47:08.680 --> 47:10.640
A lifer?

47:13.280 --> 47:15.760
Denied parole.

47:15.760 --> 47:18.360
Died by suicide...

47:18.360 --> 47:20.200
..11 days before the Brussels bomb.

47:20.200 --> 47:22.640
It's him.

47:22.640 --> 47:24.200
It's him.

47:27.680 --> 47:30.080
Hector Hernandez.

47:30.080 --> 47:34.280
Born in Soacha, 1976.

47:34.280 --> 47:37.240
In and out of prison
his whole life.

47:37.240 --> 47:41.400
Stealing food, escalating
to armed robbery.

47:41.400 --> 47:44.840
These poor bastards are just
easy pickings for someone.

47:50.520 --> 47:52.000
Christian.

47:56.600 --> 47:58.760
Luca Rivera.

48:00.200 --> 48:02.920
Denied parole.

48:02.920 --> 48:04.560
Hung himself.

48:06.080 --> 48:07.560
One week ago.

48:08.920 --> 48:10.480
He's on his way.

48:12.200 --> 48:14.160
Or he's already here.
