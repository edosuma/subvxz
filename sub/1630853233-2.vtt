00:06.000 --> 00:07.040
[clattering]

00:09.800 --> 00:11.800
[tense music playing]

00:17.480 --> 00:18.760
[James breathing heavily]

00:19.360 --> 00:20.360
[door opens]

00:23.520 --> 00:25.360
-[whispering] Hi.
-[James whispering] Hi.

00:26.240 --> 00:27.120
What time is it?

00:27.840 --> 00:28.920
Uh,

00:29.000 --> 00:30.640
nine something.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.440
Are you hungry?

00:36.080 --> 00:36.920
[sighs heavily]

00:37.920 --> 00:39.080
What's the matter?

00:40.600 --> 00:42.040
There's… there's been a…

00:45.200 --> 00:47.000
She's lying now.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.040
Who's lying?

00:48.560 --> 00:49.680
[James] Come out here.

00:50.200 --> 00:51.680
He's asleep. He's…

00:53.440 --> 00:55.440
[sighs] She's made an accusation.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.080
Olivia Lytton?

01:00.160 --> 01:01.560
It's absurd.

01:01.640 --> 01:02.800
Well, what did she--

01:09.000 --> 01:09.880
Rape?

01:11.120 --> 01:14.040
[Olivia breathing heavily]

01:14.880 --> 01:16.800
-[Olivia groaning]
-[clothes tearing]

01:16.880 --> 01:18.120
[horn honking]

01:18.200 --> 01:20.200
[suspenseful music playing]

01:44.440 --> 01:46.400
[woman] It's a love-hate relationship.

01:46.480 --> 01:47.360
[indistinct chatter]

01:47.440 --> 01:50.720
I love the clear goal,
and I quite love the number 10,000,

01:50.800 --> 01:53.360
but on the other hand,
it's sort of like, "Yes, thank you."

01:53.440 --> 01:56.840
"Track my activity and mind
your own fucking business," you know?

01:56.920 --> 01:58.520
[Kate chuckles] How many steps so far?

01:58.600 --> 02:01.840
[woman] Well, this has 4,300,
but I think it's wrong.

02:02.600 --> 02:06.200
All I've done this morning
is boil an egg and wash my face.

02:06.280 --> 02:07.360
[both chuckle]

02:08.000 --> 02:09.320
Wake up, Big Brother.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.680
God, such deliberation.

02:13.760 --> 02:17.320
Next to you, Michelangelo just threw paint
at the chapel Jackson Pollock style.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.320
Presentation matters.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.640
Look at us in our silly costumes.

02:23.720 --> 02:26.360
Why do we still
buy into all of this nonsense?

02:26.440 --> 02:27.640
Don't you ever wonder?

02:27.720 --> 02:28.640
I like the pomp.

02:29.160 --> 02:30.400
You mean the facade.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.200
-I said, "pomp."
-[woman chuckles]

02:33.920 --> 02:35.480
[dramatic music playing]

02:35.560 --> 02:37.600
You know you don't stand a chance
with this one?

02:38.400 --> 02:40.560
Now that just tells me you're terrified.

02:40.640 --> 02:41.800
[woman] I am terrified.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.440
That my Fitbit's on the blink.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.520
No. That would be your case, lovely.

02:46.600 --> 02:49.320
Irrevocably flawed, two separate things.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.520
[journalist] Mr Whitehouse!

02:51.560 --> 02:52.560
Mr Whitehouse!

02:52.640 --> 02:54.080
[journalists clamouring]

02:54.560 --> 02:57.200
[journalist] Sophie, do you believe
your husband is innocent?

02:58.200 --> 02:59.240
[banging]

03:00.080 --> 03:01.920
[journalist 2] Sophie,
this way, please. Quick.

03:02.000 --> 03:02.920
Ready?

03:05.640 --> 03:08.040
-[journalist 3] Mrs Whitehouse!
-Good morning.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.240
[journalist 4] Sophie.

03:09.320 --> 03:11.520
Sophie! Do you think
he can get away with it?

03:11.600 --> 03:14.400
[journalist 5] What's it like sleeping
with an accused rapist?

03:14.480 --> 03:16.400
[camera shutters clicking]

03:19.520 --> 03:22.120
[woman] As I said, this is the easy part.

03:23.600 --> 03:24.440
Shall we?

03:29.840 --> 03:31.240
I'm Angela Regan.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.520
You must be Sophie.

03:32.600 --> 03:33.960
Thank you for your help.

03:34.040 --> 03:34.920
Of course.

03:36.360 --> 03:37.880
[ominous music playing]

03:47.680 --> 03:49.720
[judge] Are we ready to enter a plea?

03:49.800 --> 03:50.920
[Angela] Yes, My Lord.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.240
[clerk] James Whitehouse,
you are charged with rape.

03:55.720 --> 03:58.280
That on the 12th day of October 2018,

03:58.800 --> 04:02.480
you intentionally penetrated the vagina
of Olivia Lytton with your penis,

04:03.000 --> 04:06.560
the said Olivia Lytton
not consenting to the penetration,

04:06.640 --> 04:08.640
and you, James Whitehouse,

04:08.720 --> 04:11.800
not reasonably believing
that Olivia Lytton consented.

04:12.760 --> 04:13.760
How do you plead?

04:14.400 --> 04:16.560
Guilty or not guilty?

04:22.280 --> 04:23.280
Not guilty.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.240
[indistinct murmuring]

04:26.320 --> 04:27.560
[judge] Thank you, Miss Regan.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.320
Now, I understand both sides have agreed

04:30.400 --> 04:33.680
that three months
will be adequate for preparation.

04:33.760 --> 04:34.680
[Sophie panting]

04:34.760 --> 04:35.880
[Angela] Yes, My Lord.

04:36.720 --> 04:40.840
The date for the trial
has been set for the first of April.

04:40.920 --> 04:44.160
Does either party
have any difficulties with the date?

04:44.720 --> 04:46.000
Counsel have discussed the date

04:46.080 --> 04:48.400
and we are agreed
that the first of April is suitable.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.160
And what are his bail conditions,
Miss Woodcroft?

04:52.240 --> 04:56.280
To surrender his passport and not
to contact any prosecution witnesses.

04:56.360 --> 05:00.000
[judge] Right. Well, those conditions
are to continue until the next hearing.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.400
I believe that completes the housekeeping?

05:02.480 --> 05:03.760
Yes, My Lord.

05:03.880 --> 05:05.120
Thank you, My Lord.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.360
[clerk] Be upstanding.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.080
[dramatic music playing]

05:20.280 --> 05:21.920
[indistinct chatter]

05:23.840 --> 05:25.920
[woman] A person, A, commits an offence

05:26.000 --> 05:30.120
if a, he intentionally penetrates
the vagina, anus or mouth

05:30.200 --> 05:32.760
of another person, B, with his penis,

05:32.840 --> 05:35.600
b, B does not consent to this penetration,

05:35.680 --> 05:38.680
and c, A does not reasonably believe
that B consents.

05:38.760 --> 05:41.080
Someone should set
the Sexual Offences Act to music.

05:41.160 --> 05:42.280
Oh, I did, almost.

05:42.360 --> 05:47.400
Well, not music, but a mnemonic thing.
VAMP, for vagina, anus, mouth, penis.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.720
Do you know what vamp means,
other than in terms of music?

05:49.800 --> 05:52.920
It's old-fashioned slang
for a flirtatious woman, isn't it?

05:53.440 --> 05:56.560
Well, it will always be vagina, anus,
mouth, penis to me.

05:56.640 --> 05:57.480
[Kate chuckles]

05:58.840 --> 06:01.280
[woman] Juries don't like
relationship rape, do they?

06:01.800 --> 06:02.760
What's there to like?

06:03.480 --> 06:05.720
Take it from your pupil mistress, Maggie,

06:05.800 --> 06:09.400
prosecuting sexual assault
is as urgent as it is frustrating.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.720
Lest we forget, we live in a country
where raping your wife

06:12.800 --> 06:16.520
wasn't legally considered rape until 1991.

06:17.120 --> 06:18.440
1991.

06:19.440 --> 06:22.400
Well, curious he's got the PM
on his side, Whitehouse.

06:22.480 --> 06:25.480
I can think of at least three government
blokes accused of similar things

06:25.560 --> 06:28.600
when it seemed like Tom Southern
couldn't cut ties fast enough.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.160
-They're old friends.
-He looks like a rapist.

06:31.840 --> 06:32.800
Why do you say that?

06:32.880 --> 06:36.120
I always think
when someone's that handsome, look out.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.520
[dramatic music playing]

06:38.400 --> 06:42.240
Madam Speaker, there's a notable absence
in our chamber today.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.560
Unless you've been residing under a rock,

06:44.640 --> 06:47.040
you'll know that
the honourable member for Thurlsdon

06:47.120 --> 06:48.920
is facing a charge of rape,

06:49.720 --> 06:52.160
and has therefore
been stripped of his ministry.

06:52.240 --> 06:54.320
Now aside
from what a nasty business that is,

06:54.400 --> 06:58.960
it leaves Mr Whitehouse's proposed
amendment to his own immigration bill,

06:59.480 --> 07:01.960
-…um, hanging, as it were.
-[murmuring]

07:02.480 --> 07:04.520
In light of which, Madam Speaker,

07:04.600 --> 07:08.160
I wonder if the Prime Minister
fears postponement of its consideration

07:08.760 --> 07:11.120
lays the ground for thousands of migrants

07:11.200 --> 07:13.360
to be similarly left hanging.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.240
[murmuring]

07:15.320 --> 07:18.640
Mr Aitken can rest assured
I have no such fear.

07:18.720 --> 07:23.160
Immigration is top of both mind
and agenda in our cabinet.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.760
Consideration of the measure will proceed

07:25.840 --> 07:28.600
under the general auspices
of the Home Office.

07:29.440 --> 07:32.280
Speaking of Mr Whitehouse,

07:32.360 --> 07:34.920
could the Prime Minister clarify
for the electorate

07:35.520 --> 07:38.960
whether he still has full confidence
in his dear friend,

07:39.640 --> 07:41.800
given that his dear friend

07:41.880 --> 07:44.840
is about to stand trial
at the Old Bailey for rape?

07:45.520 --> 07:48.160
And if his dear chum, Mr Whitehouse,

07:48.240 --> 07:52.160
does indeed continue to enjoy
the Prime Minister's full confidence,

07:52.240 --> 07:56.200
would he be so kind as to explain why?

07:56.280 --> 07:57.440
[clamouring]

07:57.520 --> 08:00.040
Order! Order! Order!

08:00.640 --> 08:01.640
Order!

08:02.360 --> 08:03.200
Why?

08:04.400 --> 08:05.360
Why?

08:06.480 --> 08:10.880
Because last time I checked,
a man accused is not a man convicted.

08:10.960 --> 08:11.840
[indistinct murmuring]

08:11.920 --> 08:14.960
Because until an allegation is proved

08:15.040 --> 08:18.680
beyond a reasonable doubt
in a court of law,

08:18.760 --> 08:22.360
a man who abandons
a long-standing colleague and friend

08:22.440 --> 08:24.840
is not only fair-weather but spineless.

08:24.920 --> 08:26.480
[indistinct murmuring]

08:30.680 --> 08:32.520
[Chris] This won't be the end of it.

08:32.600 --> 08:35.120
First it's an affair, then a rape.
What's next, cannibalism?

08:35.200 --> 08:37.800
-You don't need this shit.
-Is there a pill you could take?

08:37.880 --> 08:40.920
Let's consider what you might take,
because it'll be right up the arse.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.160
-Lovely.
-It's not just that he's a minister--

08:43.240 --> 08:45.440
-He's no longer a minister.
-Who's your best mate.

08:45.520 --> 08:48.040
People will wonder what he's got on you
to earn your support.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.400
How about that he's innocent.
Would that count for anything?

08:50.480 --> 08:52.880
He needs to be "former" best mate,
"former" inner circle,

08:52.960 --> 08:54.760
I say this as one
who has affection for James.

08:54.840 --> 08:56.280
Yes. I can see it oozing out now.

08:56.360 --> 08:59.440
Gone are the days when a shag
would be a mark in the Whip's black book.

08:59.520 --> 09:02.440
It's different now.
The road is paved in Me Too land mines.

09:02.520 --> 09:04.240
I beseech you, Prime Minister,

09:04.760 --> 09:07.760
don't let Whitehouse's
fucking fuck-up bring you down.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.120
-Chris.
-Has he got something on you?

09:10.200 --> 09:11.440
Just tell me.

09:13.440 --> 09:14.360
Fine.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.080
[school bell ringing]

09:19.440 --> 09:20.400
[door opens]

09:20.480 --> 09:22.160
[indistinct chatter]

09:28.560 --> 09:29.880
-Hello.
-Hi.

09:30.600 --> 09:33.800
Is it just me, or does it feel
many degrees colder than it is?

09:33.880 --> 09:35.160
Maybe it's the wind.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.040
Or winter?

09:38.920 --> 09:41.880
We're looking forward to Saturday.
I promise no last-minute bailing.

09:41.960 --> 09:44.040
Which is what I needed to tell you.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.600
Mark has been roped into
some constituency event,

09:46.680 --> 09:48.480
so we now won't be here.

09:49.200 --> 09:52.520
That's such a shame that Ginny
will have to miss her dance recital.

09:53.400 --> 09:54.800
Oh no, we'll go up after that.

09:54.880 --> 09:58.440
So the constituency event
is late on Saturday night?

09:59.480 --> 10:00.320
Must be.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.120
Mark talked me through
how it was all going to work,

10:03.200 --> 10:04.920
but now I forget the specifics.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.680
[Ellie inhales, sniffs]

10:06.760 --> 10:08.120
-Another time.
-Please.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.320
How about Sunday?

10:10.400 --> 10:11.800
[dramatic music playing]

10:13.000 --> 10:13.880
[scoffs]

10:14.400 --> 10:15.640
I'm joking, Ellie.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.000
[children] Bye!

10:17.080 --> 10:18.600
[children clamouring]

10:18.680 --> 10:19.640
[whispering] Hello.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.000
Come on. Quick, quick.

10:22.440 --> 10:25.360
-Can I go over to Joe's?
-Not today, darling. No.

10:25.440 --> 10:26.720
Why not?

10:26.800 --> 10:28.160
'Cause it's a busy time.

10:28.240 --> 10:29.600
I'm not busy.

10:30.440 --> 10:31.280
Come on.

10:32.720 --> 10:35.720
Scarlet was talking about Daddy
going to court today.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.880
Well, people will talk.
We've discussed this.

10:39.480 --> 10:42.240
What you need to remember
is it's all a big misunderstanding.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.680
But people believe it's true.

10:45.320 --> 10:47.400
Is he going to go to jail?

10:47.480 --> 10:48.760
Don't be ridiculous.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.840
-Guess what?
-[children] What?

10:52.920 --> 10:54.480
Daddy's got a surprise for you.

10:56.520 --> 10:57.800
[breathing heavily]

11:01.680 --> 11:02.760
[children gasping]

11:02.840 --> 11:03.760
[puppy whimpering]

11:03.840 --> 11:05.240
[Emily] Are we keeping him?

11:05.320 --> 11:08.840
Well, it wouldn't be very nice
to return our new pup. Would it?

11:08.920 --> 11:10.120
[boy] What's he called?

11:10.200 --> 11:12.480
She's a she, and she needs a name.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.160
She's so warm.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.720
Can I have a turn?

11:16.320 --> 11:17.960
[dramatic music playing]

11:21.680 --> 11:23.200
[whispering] What's your name?

11:23.760 --> 11:24.920
What did she say, Finn?

11:26.160 --> 11:27.000
[Finn] She said

11:28.480 --> 11:29.560
Velcro.

11:29.640 --> 11:30.480
[Sophie laughs]

11:30.560 --> 11:32.000
Velcro Whitehouse.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.480
I hereby christen our lovely new pooch…

11:34.560 --> 11:37.200
-[children] A Whitehouse.
-And what's the thing about Whitehouses?

11:37.280 --> 11:39.360
We always come out on top.

11:39.440 --> 11:40.400
[Sophie chuckles]

11:41.120 --> 11:42.400
Welcome to the family.

11:46.000 --> 11:46.960
[James sighs]

11:48.760 --> 11:49.680
[piano playing]

11:49.760 --> 11:51.560
Oh I love them, Aunt Kate!

11:51.640 --> 11:53.440
Oh I'm so pleased, Ollie.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.200
[Ollie] Look what I got.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.280
[man] Oh great. Do you like it?

11:59.920 --> 12:01.040
Don't take this the wrong way,

12:01.120 --> 12:03.760
but occasionally I do imagine
the unfortunate accident

12:03.840 --> 12:07.280
that would lead to having
my gorgeous godson all to myself.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.280
You raise one, you raise all three.

12:09.360 --> 12:10.520
I'd do it happily.

12:10.600 --> 12:11.440
Liar.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.120
I remember the young Kate.
You never wanted kids.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.000
Now and then my imagination does.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.080
[woman] Bollocks.

12:17.680 --> 12:21.360
As is the secret you kept from me.

12:21.440 --> 12:22.280
What secret?

12:24.320 --> 12:27.640
I take it this
is the "quite high-profile" case

12:27.720 --> 12:28.840
to which you referred?

12:30.680 --> 12:32.720
-Yes.
-You sure about this one?

12:32.800 --> 12:34.800
Well, you're the one
who encouraged me to take it.

12:34.880 --> 12:38.400
Yes. But it's James Whitehouse.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.080
And he's a minister.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.720
Former minister.

12:41.800 --> 12:42.800
For now.

12:42.880 --> 12:46.320
Look, I hate to say it, but he seems
to be doing a good job, for a Tory.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.920
I don't care who he is.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.400
The CPS thinks it's a strong case.

12:51.320 --> 12:52.960
As long as you know what you're doing.

12:54.240 --> 12:55.320
[sloshing]

12:55.400 --> 12:57.280
[tense music playing]

12:57.840 --> 12:59.760
[James] …go out clubbing, am I, Chris?

12:59.840 --> 13:00.720
Obviously.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.160
No.

13:04.360 --> 13:07.720
As I've already told you
a thousand times, only Olivia.

13:09.640 --> 13:10.760
Well, of course.

13:12.360 --> 13:13.600
Of course.

13:13.680 --> 13:14.880
Understood.

13:17.720 --> 13:19.560
That was Chris Clarke,

13:20.080 --> 13:22.320
confirming I'm gonna keep a low-profile.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.960
And what was he saying about Olivia?

13:24.040 --> 13:26.640
[sighs] Nothing. He wanted to be sure

13:26.720 --> 13:29.200
there wouldn't be any more
surprises from my past,

13:29.280 --> 13:30.800
which I assured him there would not.

13:30.880 --> 13:32.360
What about her past?

13:32.880 --> 13:35.160
Why doesn't he focus
on Olivia Lytton for God's sake?

13:35.240 --> 13:38.400
Why is she lying about you?
Why doesn't he poke into that?

13:38.480 --> 13:40.840
[James] Oh, he'll poke
into everything, believe me.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.800
And apparently, we've got a proper cunt,

13:42.880 --> 13:44.440
his word, as a QC.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.880
He says this Kate Woodcroft is relentless.

13:47.520 --> 13:48.600
I hate her.

13:48.680 --> 13:49.680
Who?

13:49.760 --> 13:50.600
Olivia.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.320
For lying about you,
for trying to destroy you.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.720
And for what? She's upset over a fling.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
In the meantime,
you have to rally the troops.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.600
Reach out to Tom.
Make sure he really is still on side.

14:02.680 --> 14:04.280
He can't be seen with me right now.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.680
So don't be seen with him.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.720
[Tom] Oh right? Lovely.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.000
[man] See you later, old chap.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.800
[indistinct chatter]

14:16.680 --> 14:18.640
Excuse me, would you hold that thought?

14:18.720 --> 14:20.720
[dramatic music playing]

14:42.840 --> 14:43.760
Did you do it?

14:44.280 --> 14:45.680
-Rape her?
-[Tom] Yes.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.520
No. How can you ask me that?

14:47.600 --> 14:49.680
You know better.
You know me better than anybody else.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.720
I'm sorry. I had to ask.

14:52.560 --> 14:54.680
Chris thinks they're gonna start
digging into the past.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.120
[Tom] Well, let them dig.

14:56.200 --> 14:59.600
What else are they gonna find but photos
of a bunch of posh lads behaving badly?

14:59.680 --> 15:01.440
They published those when I became PM.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.160
They might not stop there this time.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.440
We'll get through this.

15:05.040 --> 15:06.480
I am terrified.

15:06.560 --> 15:08.400
[Tom] We'll get through this.

15:08.920 --> 15:11.200
Chris says the case
against you is pitifully weak.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.640
It'll be over soon.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.920
Omertà of the Libertines.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.520
[tense music playing]

15:22.440 --> 15:24.720
-[boys clamouring]
-Omertà of the Libertines!

15:24.800 --> 15:26.640
Omertà of the Libertines!

15:26.720 --> 15:28.600
More champers.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.680
-[boy] Excellent work, Tom.
-[Tom] Let's not drink it.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.240
-Let's waste it.
-[boys clamour in agreement]

15:34.320 --> 15:36.880
Let's drink it and piss it up the wall.

15:36.960 --> 15:38.520
-[all] Yeah!
-[scattered clapping]

15:40.680 --> 15:42.200
Put your todger back, man.

15:42.280 --> 15:44.440
Come on, man, open it.

15:44.520 --> 15:45.840
[boys cheering]

15:48.680 --> 15:50.680
[boys shouting, laughing indistinctly]

15:53.960 --> 15:55.080
[laughing]

15:57.120 --> 15:58.720
[Tom] Pour it away.

16:05.520 --> 16:06.680
More Bolly!

16:11.440 --> 16:13.480
In years to come, we'll be able to say

16:13.560 --> 16:16.400
we were rich enough
to pour our Bolly away.

16:18.440 --> 16:19.400
Mwah!

16:25.240 --> 16:26.960
[suspenseful music playing]

16:28.200 --> 16:29.320
[waitress gasping]

16:29.960 --> 16:31.240
[Tom] Don't look so shocked.

16:32.040 --> 16:32.920
I'll support you.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.200
[boys raucously cheering]

16:34.280 --> 16:35.840
[Tom laughing]

16:49.320 --> 16:52.680
A thousand apologies
for my beastly friends.

16:52.760 --> 16:55.560
We will, of course,
reimburse you for the damage.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.640
Yeah!

17:00.920 --> 17:02.640
[dramatic music playing]

17:06.680 --> 17:08.800
[Tom] All the Bolly, now pour it away!

17:08.880 --> 17:10.520
[all] All the Bolly, now pour it away!

17:10.600 --> 17:13.320
All the Bolly, now pour it away!
All the Bolly, now pour it away!

17:13.400 --> 17:16.080
All the Bolly, now pour it away!
All the Bolly, now pour it away!

17:16.160 --> 17:17.520
All the Bolly, now pour it away!

17:17.600 --> 17:19.600
[boys clamouring, raucously cheering]

17:21.440 --> 17:22.280
[music fades]

17:22.360 --> 17:25.000
[Kate] …the power difference,
for one thing. Olivia was his employee.

17:25.080 --> 17:27.520
[man] Yes, but don't you find
that juries often have a soft spot

17:27.600 --> 17:28.920
for the office romance?

17:29.520 --> 17:32.160
Not when there's such a difference
in status and age.

17:32.240 --> 17:34.160
What kind of agency did she really have?

17:34.240 --> 17:36.080
Now, that's a buzzword for you. Agency.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.840
It is if you've never
had to worry about it.

17:37.920 --> 17:40.160
I'm objecting to the lingo,
not the concept.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.080
I know.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.440
[indistinct chatter]

17:42.520 --> 17:45.680
The hard part, of course,
is that she fancied him.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.560
You know what Maggie was saying?

17:50.640 --> 17:51.800
Who's Maggie?

17:51.880 --> 17:54.080
My pupil. I told you about her.

17:54.680 --> 17:55.720
From Slough.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.320
-Bright, ambitious.
-Which is why she got out of Slough.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.040
Snob.

18:02.600 --> 18:06.200
Anyway, she thinks that James Whitehouse
looks like a rapist.

18:07.200 --> 18:08.120
Based on what?

18:10.520 --> 18:11.400
Nothing.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.320
It's probably nonsense.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.680
She just has an instinct about him.

18:16.480 --> 18:17.680
Anyway, I like her.

18:17.760 --> 18:19.160
-Who?
-[Kate] Maggie.

18:19.240 --> 18:21.320
She's direct, doesn't hold back.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.800
As long as she follows your lead.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.800
Times have changed
since you were my pupil master.

18:25.880 --> 18:27.440
How so?

18:28.360 --> 18:30.160
I never questioned what you told me.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.280
They're more sceptical these days.

18:32.360 --> 18:33.200
Confident.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.280
[woman laughing]

18:38.720 --> 18:39.760
Can you come home with me?

18:39.840 --> 18:40.920
[man sighs]

18:42.040 --> 18:42.920
Yes, please.

18:43.000 --> 18:43.920
Felicity?

18:45.480 --> 18:46.480
In Wiltshire.

18:48.680 --> 18:49.520
Yay.

18:50.800 --> 18:51.640
[kissing]

18:56.160 --> 18:58.040
[car engine revving]

19:06.680 --> 19:08.320
[James] Why are you sitting in the dark?

19:08.880 --> 19:09.800
No reason.

19:11.080 --> 19:12.080
[light switch clicks]

19:12.160 --> 19:13.040
How was he?

19:14.160 --> 19:15.240
[James] Steadfast.

19:16.360 --> 19:17.200
[Sophie] Good.

19:21.600 --> 19:22.840
Can I get you something?

19:24.080 --> 19:25.480
I made a mistake.

19:25.560 --> 19:26.640
[James] Marrying me?

19:26.720 --> 19:27.560
[Sophie scoffs]

19:28.320 --> 19:29.680
Giving up my career.

19:30.240 --> 19:31.840
Stupid mistake.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.800
I think you're revising history
a little bit.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.640
[Sophie] What do you mean?

19:36.720 --> 19:39.320
I was utterly invested
in children's literature.

19:39.400 --> 19:42.360
I practically lived in Narnia
while I did my dissertation.

19:42.440 --> 19:43.520
Okay.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.440
What?

19:45.000 --> 19:49.360
I just remember a lot of "bloody Narnia"s"
and "fuck Narnia," and--

19:50.080 --> 19:54.080
Well, you're the one who jokes about
having charmed your way through a degree.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.680
Well, yes, dissertations are hard,

19:56.760 --> 19:58.280
but anyway, it got me a job.

19:58.360 --> 19:59.880
You were frustrated at Macmillan.

19:59.960 --> 20:03.440
It was all lost socks
and narcoleptic dinosaurs.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.240
I was frustrated
with the preschool division.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.440
If I'd stuck it out, moved on to YA…

20:09.320 --> 20:11.880
I suppose I didn't love it
like you love your job,

20:11.960 --> 20:14.920
but I still managed to get a degree
from one of the best universities.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.360
I'm sure I could get hired somewhere.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.520
So you want to look for a job, now?

20:23.640 --> 20:25.840
Well, when all this is over, then.

20:27.440 --> 20:29.160
I think that's a wonderful idea.

20:35.160 --> 20:36.760
Maybe it's best I'm not there.

20:37.480 --> 20:38.320
Where?

20:38.960 --> 20:41.440
[Sophie] In court every day
once the trial starts.

20:41.520 --> 20:43.320
[dramatic music playing]

20:43.920 --> 20:47.720
I don't know if I can bear it.
And what use would I be anyway?

20:47.800 --> 20:50.360
What use would you be, Sophie?
I can tell you right now.

20:50.440 --> 20:51.760
If you don't show up in court,

20:51.840 --> 20:54.080
you may as well announce
to the world you think I'm guilty.

20:54.160 --> 20:55.080
Don't get sharp.

20:55.160 --> 20:56.520
I could go to prison.

20:56.600 --> 20:57.880
That's not going to happen.

20:59.600 --> 21:02.320
If you believe me, you'll be there.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.000
I do believe you,

21:05.680 --> 21:08.600
but I'm gonna have to see
how I feel in three months' time.

21:11.080 --> 21:12.040
[sighs]

21:13.800 --> 21:14.800
Okay.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.200
It's a long way away.

21:22.400 --> 21:25.920
I didn't mean to imply
that you weren't a serious student.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.880
[bell-tower ringing]

21:38.960 --> 21:40.160
[bells chiming]

21:40.920 --> 21:41.920
[indistinct chatter]

21:42.000 --> 21:43.640
[Sophie] It's the ultimate test.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.800
"Sir Gawain, the youngest
of all of King Arthur's knights,

21:46.880 --> 21:49.800
bravely volunteers
to accept the Green Knight's challenge,

21:49.880 --> 21:53.200
and in doing so, he proves his commitment
to the code of chivalry."

21:57.240 --> 21:59.200
[clears throat] What about you, Holly?

21:59.280 --> 22:01.600
Do you agree with Sophie's analysis?

22:02.320 --> 22:04.560
Yes and no.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.760
I think things get more interesting

22:06.840 --> 22:09.640
after the Green Knight
picks up his own severed head.

22:09.720 --> 22:12.320
Gawain's a womaniser,

22:12.840 --> 22:16.000
And he has to choose
between loyalty or courtesy.

22:16.080 --> 22:16.960
So it is a test.

22:17.760 --> 22:18.880
It's subversive.

22:18.960 --> 22:22.840
It both elevates and rubbishes
the whole idea of chivalry.

22:23.320 --> 22:25.160
[man chuckles] That's rather a neat take.

22:25.760 --> 22:26.600
Holly.

22:27.080 --> 22:27.920
Holly.

22:29.400 --> 22:30.320
You're clever.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.040
Let's divide and conquer.

22:32.120 --> 22:33.040
What?

22:33.520 --> 22:35.360
[Sophie] The Anglo-Saxon translations.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.240
We are tutorial partners after all.

22:38.320 --> 22:40.560
-[Holly] But--
-[Sophie] I'm just being practical.

22:40.640 --> 22:43.840
There is so much to read
and so many more fun things to do.

22:44.760 --> 22:45.600
What do you think?

22:47.360 --> 22:48.800
I think he would have gone for you.

22:48.880 --> 22:49.920
Who?

22:50.520 --> 22:51.600
King Arthur's knight.

22:52.720 --> 22:53.760
You're his type.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.360
[Sophie scoffing]

22:56.520 --> 22:58.360
[dramatic music playing]

23:03.800 --> 23:05.200
[whispering] Holly.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.960
Did you finish the whatsit?

23:08.040 --> 23:09.560
-[Holly] The Malory?
-[Sophie] Yeah.

23:09.640 --> 23:10.960
[Holly] Did you read your part?

23:11.440 --> 23:14.800
Not yet, but I am getting an essay
from my friend Ned later.

23:14.880 --> 23:16.680
I got it in exchange for two beers.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.040
Is that all it cost you?

23:18.120 --> 23:19.600
Holly. [chuckles]

23:19.680 --> 23:20.920
What are you implying?

23:22.040 --> 23:23.400
So do you have those notes?

23:26.040 --> 23:26.880
Okay.

23:26.960 --> 23:27.840
Well…

23:29.960 --> 23:31.600
I've got to get to practice.

23:31.680 --> 23:32.680
You're a goddess.

23:41.160 --> 23:42.520
[music fading]

23:43.080 --> 23:44.800
[ducks quacking]

23:54.920 --> 23:56.480
[dramatic music playing]

23:57.280 --> 23:58.880
[breathing heavily]

24:19.480 --> 24:20.680
[water sloshing]

24:20.760 --> 24:21.880
[duck warbling]

24:57.880 --> 24:58.840
[door closing]

24:59.800 --> 25:00.760
[alarm chirps]

25:03.600 --> 25:05.160
[Velcro barking]

25:05.240 --> 25:06.120
[whispering] Hi.

25:07.520 --> 25:08.640
When are you leaving?

25:08.720 --> 25:09.800
Half past.

25:09.880 --> 25:10.720
I'll be ready.

25:11.480 --> 25:12.560
[Velcro barking]

25:15.440 --> 25:16.520
[sighs]

25:18.240 --> 25:20.080
[journalists clamouring]

25:24.720 --> 25:27.120
[journalist] Do you have the
Prime Minister's support, Mr Whitehouse?

25:28.120 --> 25:29.840
[journalist 2] What'd you think
your marriage--

25:29.920 --> 25:31.440
[camera shutters clicking]

25:34.520 --> 25:37.480
[judge] If you follow politics,
if you follow the media,

25:37.560 --> 25:40.600
you may recognise the man being tried.

25:41.080 --> 25:45.400
But I want you to be impervious
to whatever you've read or heard.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.280
This is a rape case.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.120
A serious crime, obviously.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.600
Now, we all have prejudices,

25:53.680 --> 25:57.320
but you must not let
preconceived ideas or conjecture

25:57.400 --> 25:59.480
influence you at any time.

26:00.240 --> 26:04.600
The case must be tried solely
according to the evidence.

26:05.520 --> 26:08.800
So from this point on, you are instructed

26:08.880 --> 26:11.080
to stay off the Internet.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.640
Nor under any circumstances

26:13.720 --> 26:16.240
are you to conduct your own research.

26:16.320 --> 26:21.480
Most importantly, you are not
to discuss the case outside the jury room.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.200
Not with friends,

26:24.240 --> 26:25.240
not with family.

26:29.560 --> 26:31.560
-[man clearing throat]
-[woman coughing]

26:32.920 --> 26:36.240
I am Miss Woodcroft,
and I appear on behalf of the prosecution.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.320
The defendant, James Whitehouse,
is represented by Miss Regan

26:40.400 --> 26:41.760
who sits to my right.

26:41.840 --> 26:43.040
[dramatic music playing]

26:43.120 --> 26:46.840
This case concerns an event
that took place between two individuals,

26:47.440 --> 26:49.320
James Whitehouse, the defendant,

26:49.400 --> 26:51.920
and a young woman named Olivia Lytton.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.240
Mr Whitehouse, as his Lordship
has said, may look familiar.

26:56.040 --> 26:57.360
He is a member of Parliament,

26:57.440 --> 27:01.040
and until he was charged
with this offence, a government minister.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.680
He is married with two young children.

27:05.360 --> 27:08.040
Miss Lytton
was his parliamentary researcher.

27:08.640 --> 27:11.160
She started working for him
in March of last year.

27:11.240 --> 27:14.760
By May, the two of them
had embarked on an affair.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.640
It was a consensual relationship,

27:17.720 --> 27:20.960
which was ended by Mr Whitehouse
on the 5th of October.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.560
And that might have been that.

27:24.640 --> 27:25.880
Except it wasn't.

27:27.320 --> 27:30.520
Miss Lytton
continued to work for James Whitehouse,

27:31.080 --> 27:35.160
and on the 12th of October,
a week after their affair had finished,

27:35.840 --> 27:36.960
he raped her

27:37.800 --> 27:38.800
in a lift

27:39.320 --> 27:43.040
off the committee corridor
in the heart of the House of Commons.

27:44.160 --> 27:47.040
There is no dispute
that sexual intercourse took place.

27:47.600 --> 27:50.720
What is in dispute is the nature of it.

27:51.320 --> 27:54.360
Was this, as the Crown submits,

27:55.000 --> 27:58.640
a violent act of rape
to which Miss Lytton did not consent?

27:59.360 --> 28:01.960
Or was it, as the defence submits,

28:02.040 --> 28:03.360
an act of passion,

28:04.000 --> 28:05.560
a frenzied bout of lovemaking

28:05.640 --> 28:07.760
by two individuals
caught up in the moment?

28:09.000 --> 28:10.760
Yes, or no.

28:11.280 --> 28:13.520
That is what consent comes down to.

28:14.800 --> 28:17.720
In this case,
it is the Crown's simple contention

28:18.240 --> 28:20.520
that what began as a "yes"

28:20.600 --> 28:23.360
very quickly became a "no."

28:24.480 --> 28:28.360
When you come to consider your verdict,
you must decide three things.

28:29.080 --> 28:32.840
One, did penetration
by a penis take place?

28:32.920 --> 28:35.120
The answer is yes. That is not in dispute.

28:36.200 --> 28:40.760
Two, at the point of penetration
did Miss Lytton consent?

28:41.480 --> 28:44.720
And three, at the point of penetration

28:44.800 --> 28:49.680
did Mr Whitehouse reasonably believe
that Miss Lytton was consenting?

28:50.840 --> 28:53.040
It really is no more
complicated than that.

29:03.480 --> 29:04.640
[door opens]

29:14.920 --> 29:16.560
Can you swear in the witness?

29:21.040 --> 29:23.080
[clerk] Can you read the words
on the card?

29:25.440 --> 29:28.680
I swear by almighty God
that the evidence I shall give

29:28.760 --> 29:31.960
shall be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

29:37.680 --> 29:39.000
[Olivia sighs heavily]

29:40.240 --> 29:42.240
[tense music playing]

29:45.000 --> 29:46.720
Could you state your name, please?

29:46.800 --> 29:48.200
Olivia Lytton.

29:48.280 --> 29:51.320
Your full name
and a little louder, please.

29:51.400 --> 29:52.880
Olivia Clarissa Lytton.

29:54.320 --> 29:56.120
Ms Lytton,
I'm going to ask you some questions

29:56.200 --> 29:57.920
and we're going
to take things slowly.

29:58.000 --> 29:58.960
Okay?

29:59.040 --> 30:00.560
Let's begin at the beginning.

30:01.440 --> 30:04.040
When did you start working
for Mr Whitehouse?

30:04.120 --> 30:05.080
In March.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.680
[Kate] And what was your role
in his office?

30:07.760 --> 30:09.960
I was a parliamentary researcher.

30:10.040 --> 30:11.360
Did you enjoy your work?

30:11.960 --> 30:15.120
Very much.
I was able to put my education to use.

30:15.200 --> 30:18.040
I don't think it's in dispute
that you went to Cambridge University

30:18.120 --> 30:20.520
and took a degree in political science.

30:20.600 --> 30:23.080
And studied public policy as a postgrad.

30:23.160 --> 30:24.640
Could you just tell us a bit about

30:24.720 --> 30:27.280
what your work
as a parliamentary researcher involved?

30:27.880 --> 30:32.040
[Olivia] In addition to investigating
all the nuances of a given issue,

30:32.120 --> 30:36.360
I would also contribute writing
to briefings and press releases.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.920
How would you describe
the culture within the office?

30:40.800 --> 30:41.680
Collegial.

30:42.240 --> 30:45.480
Uh, we worked long hours and felt
like we were in the trenches together.

30:45.560 --> 30:48.320
And how did the staff
feel about Mr Whitehouse?

30:48.400 --> 30:51.040
We all liked him, respected him.

30:51.120 --> 30:52.560
[Kate] How did you address him?

30:52.640 --> 30:55.400
We all called him Minister,
but he preferred James.

30:55.480 --> 30:58.360
-Did you call him James?
-No. Always Minister.

30:59.320 --> 31:00.360
Until later.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.320
[Kate] What was he like?

31:02.960 --> 31:04.760
[Olivia] Friendly, but not overly so.

31:04.840 --> 31:06.720
Did you socialise together?

31:06.800 --> 31:09.920
Patrick and Kitty,
the staff in the private office and I,

31:10.000 --> 31:11.560
would sometimes go for a drink.

31:12.320 --> 31:14.000
-But James never did.
-[man] I don't disagree.

31:14.080 --> 31:16.680
It's a sound immigration reform
the minister is proposing.

31:16.760 --> 31:18.480
-Sound? It's brilliant.
-[indistinct chatter]

31:18.560 --> 31:23.040
It manages to be tough and humane
and apolitical all at once.

31:23.120 --> 31:24.960
That's how talented a politician James is.

31:25.040 --> 31:27.000
He can sell anything to the public.

31:27.520 --> 31:29.320
Those cocktail eyes of his don't hurt.

31:29.400 --> 31:32.280
Olivia! He's old and married.

31:32.360 --> 31:35.120
I'm merely referring
to his ability to seduce the electorate.

31:38.960 --> 31:41.720
[Kate] And why didn't the minister
join the staff for drinks?

31:41.800 --> 31:43.200
He had a heavy workload,

31:43.760 --> 31:46.800
and he would say
he needed to go home to see his family.

31:49.560 --> 31:51.840
[Kate] Did things change
between you and Mr Whitehouse?

31:51.920 --> 31:54.480
-[Olivia] Yes.
-[Kate] How did that change come about?

31:54.560 --> 31:57.520
When we first went
for a drink together on the 18th of May.

31:57.600 --> 32:00.520
I'd been for a drink
with friends earlier from the office.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.560
-See you tomorrow.
-Too late.

32:02.640 --> 32:05.080
-No, no, no.
-I've already bought us a third round.

32:05.160 --> 32:06.200
See you tomorrow.

32:06.280 --> 32:07.960
[upbeat music playing]

32:09.800 --> 32:11.120
[Kate] What happened next?

32:11.200 --> 32:13.280
I realised
I'd forgotten my gym bag at the office,

32:13.360 --> 32:16.240
and I was planning on
an early-morning workout, so I went back.

32:16.320 --> 32:18.320
[bell ringing]

32:20.280 --> 32:21.760
[tense music playing]

32:22.760 --> 32:24.640
[Olivia] Oh, Minister.

32:25.920 --> 32:26.760
Olivia.

32:27.280 --> 32:30.480
[Kate] And on the 18th of May,
when you ran into Mr Whitehouse,

32:30.560 --> 32:31.480
what happened?

32:33.000 --> 32:34.520
[Olivia] I think I was nervous.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.680
The House wasn't sitting,
and I hadn't expected to see him.

32:37.760 --> 32:39.840
I was…
I was just rushing to collect my bag.

32:39.920 --> 32:42.560
-And what happened when you stumbled?
-He helped me.

32:42.640 --> 32:44.120
Uh, he sort of…

32:47.040 --> 32:48.280
-You all right?
-[Olivia] Yeah.

32:48.360 --> 32:49.520
Yep.

32:50.280 --> 32:51.200
Thanks. [chuckles]

32:51.280 --> 32:53.600
[Kate] And had anything like that
ever happened before?

32:54.480 --> 32:56.000
He'd never touched me. No.

32:56.080 --> 32:57.840
It was all quite proper in the office.

32:57.920 --> 33:00.000
How long did he carry on
touching your arm?

33:00.720 --> 33:01.600
Well, he…

33:03.600 --> 33:04.640
Thank you.

33:05.160 --> 33:06.000
Thank you.

33:09.720 --> 33:12.960
Well, he… he dropped it
once I'd put my shoe back on.

33:13.040 --> 33:15.280
-What happened next?
-He asked me for a drink.

33:15.360 --> 33:16.720
He asked you?

33:16.800 --> 33:18.040
Yes.

33:18.120 --> 33:19.960
[Kate] Do you remember the words he used?

33:20.560 --> 33:21.440
The exact words.

33:21.520 --> 33:23.320
Do you fancy a drink, Olivia?

33:23.400 --> 33:24.840
And what did you say?

33:25.520 --> 33:28.280
I said, "I probably shouldn't, but…

33:28.360 --> 33:30.600
-Yes.
-[Kate] Where did you go?

33:31.120 --> 33:32.000
The Terrace Bar.

33:33.160 --> 33:34.280
I'd call it navy.

33:34.360 --> 33:35.600
[bell ringing]

33:36.120 --> 33:37.240
[Olivia] What about you?

33:38.240 --> 33:39.440
I'd call it night.

33:39.520 --> 33:40.960
You think like a poet.

33:42.600 --> 33:44.800
-Is that a criticism?
-Not at all.

33:45.560 --> 33:47.640
Politics could always use more poetry.

33:48.240 --> 33:49.960
[glasses clattering, breaking]

33:56.880 --> 33:58.200
I like working for you--

33:58.280 --> 33:59.720
In… in your office.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.080
[dramatic music playing]

34:01.680 --> 34:03.280
I've learned a lot, actually.

34:03.360 --> 34:04.600
What have you learned?

34:07.120 --> 34:08.120
How to lie.

34:08.200 --> 34:09.120
Excuse me?

34:11.640 --> 34:13.480
[Olivia] Uh, for…
for the right reasons, I mean.

34:13.560 --> 34:16.120
Um, strategically, expertly,

34:16.200 --> 34:21.680
not… not lie as much as redirect attention
to more favourable facts.

34:22.400 --> 34:23.480
[chuckling]

34:24.480 --> 34:25.320
Cheers.

34:25.920 --> 34:27.120
Cheers.

34:29.560 --> 34:30.600
[Olivia] I'd call it navy.

34:30.680 --> 34:32.040
[James] You think like a poet.

34:32.120 --> 34:33.160
I'd call it night.

34:33.240 --> 34:35.240
I like a woman who likes her whiskey.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.840
[glasses clattering, breaking]

34:38.920 --> 34:39.960
My dad taught me.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.520
He says I have a discerning palate.

34:48.360 --> 34:49.600
I'm not a liar, Olivia.

34:55.480 --> 34:56.440
I'm sorry, Minister.

34:56.520 --> 34:57.880
You always smell so good.

34:59.720 --> 35:00.800
That's the truth.

35:01.640 --> 35:03.640
[Kate] Did you talk about anything else?

35:03.720 --> 35:05.440
[suspenseful music playing]

35:05.520 --> 35:07.360
[Olivia] Just one thing actually.

35:07.440 --> 35:08.720
[Kate] And what was that?

35:09.400 --> 35:10.240
I said…

35:11.440 --> 35:13.360
Your wife must be wondering where you are.

35:14.160 --> 35:16.160
-[Kate] And what did he say to that?
-He didn't.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.160
[Kate] What happened next?

35:18.680 --> 35:20.160
I repeated the question.

35:20.240 --> 35:21.200
About his wife?

35:21.280 --> 35:23.080
I don't know why, but I said…

35:23.160 --> 35:26.040
No, really. Won't your wife
be wondering where you are?

35:26.120 --> 35:28.920
[Kate] And what did he say
the second time?

35:29.000 --> 35:29.960
She trusts me.

35:33.520 --> 35:36.520
[Kate] Did the affair
with Mr Whitehouse start that night?

35:36.600 --> 35:38.720
No. Nothing happened until a week later.

35:38.800 --> 35:39.760
This is May?

35:40.280 --> 35:41.280
The 23rd of May.

35:41.360 --> 35:43.200
[Kate] What happened on the 23rd of May?

35:43.280 --> 35:44.800
[Olivia] He booked a hotel.

35:52.920 --> 35:55.200
What do you think?
Shall we have some more?

35:55.280 --> 35:57.240
I owe you Parliamentary Questions
in the morning.

35:58.120 --> 36:00.080
Worry about the morning tomorrow.

36:00.160 --> 36:04.360
My heart says yes, but my head says no.
My future headache that is.

36:05.160 --> 36:07.080
Hearts are much smarter than heads.

36:08.120 --> 36:09.040
Really?

36:09.560 --> 36:10.600
Always.

36:11.680 --> 36:12.720
Heads are idiots.

36:13.240 --> 36:14.960
[Kate] How long did the relationship last?

36:15.040 --> 36:16.120
Five months.

36:17.000 --> 36:20.400
Could you tell us when Mr Whitehouse
broke off the relationship?

36:22.280 --> 36:23.760
It was the 5th of October.

36:25.520 --> 36:26.480
[James] Olivia?

36:26.560 --> 36:27.760
Do you have a moment?

36:29.880 --> 36:31.240
[phone ringing]

36:38.000 --> 36:42.120
Just so you know, James, Mary and Roger
are still managing constituent emails

36:42.200 --> 36:43.680
a mere three metres away.

36:43.760 --> 36:44.640
So…

36:47.280 --> 36:49.120
You are such a lovely woman.

36:49.720 --> 36:51.120
[scoffs] Uh-oh.

36:51.680 --> 36:54.280
We've had a great time,
but it had to conclude. We both know that.

36:54.360 --> 36:55.640
[melancholy music playing]

36:55.720 --> 36:56.560
Okay.

36:56.640 --> 36:58.400
[James] It's my preference
that you continue

36:58.480 --> 37:00.560
in your position
as parliamentary researcher

37:00.640 --> 37:02.360
because you're so damn good at it.

37:03.280 --> 37:06.160
But if you'd feel more comfortable
elsewhere, then I'd happily have a chat

37:06.240 --> 37:08.000
with another minister
or different department.

37:08.080 --> 37:09.760
No, no, no. That won't be necessary.

37:10.280 --> 37:11.760
So we're all fine then?

37:11.840 --> 37:12.960
Yes. Of course we are.

37:13.560 --> 37:14.520
'Course.

37:14.600 --> 37:16.760
Because I do so appreciate your talent.

37:16.840 --> 37:17.760
Which talent?

37:21.360 --> 37:23.680
You're amazing, Olivia.
You're young, you're bright.

37:23.760 --> 37:25.440
You could do anything you want.

37:30.720 --> 37:31.720
[inhales]

37:31.800 --> 37:34.480
What about the amendment?
Uh, the immigration amendment?

37:34.560 --> 37:36.080
I had some line edits,

37:36.160 --> 37:38.600
some language
I think might help push it through.

37:54.200 --> 37:56.360
[Kate] Do you need
to take a break, Miss Lytton?

37:56.440 --> 37:57.840
[gasping] No.

37:57.920 --> 37:59.040
Sorry. I'm fine.

37:59.640 --> 38:01.600
[Kate] That day in the office,

38:01.680 --> 38:03.160
did he say anything else?

38:03.240 --> 38:05.760
[Olivia] Honestly,
once he'd broken it off,

38:05.840 --> 38:09.240
I couldn't process the words
coming out of his mouth.

38:10.400 --> 38:12.920
Mostly I was concentrating on my own.

38:13.840 --> 38:14.720
[Kate] Your own?

38:15.840 --> 38:16.880
Mouth.

38:18.560 --> 38:22.040
I was focusing
on not letting him see my lip move.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.000
I didn't want it to end…

38:30.520 --> 38:31.760
because I was in love with him.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.240
[crowd murmuring]

38:38.320 --> 38:39.520
[sighing heavily]

38:40.040 --> 38:41.960
[high-pitched whirring]

38:43.880 --> 38:45.720
[Sophie breathing heavily]

38:45.800 --> 38:47.080
[heart beating]

38:57.760 --> 38:59.320
[suspenseful music playing]

38:59.400 --> 39:01.400
[Sophie breathing heavily]

39:21.920 --> 39:22.800
Taxi!

39:24.040 --> 39:25.360
[car brakes screeching]

39:38.080 --> 39:38.920
Krystyna?

39:39.000 --> 39:40.080
[breathing heavily]

39:42.640 --> 39:44.520
[whimpering, groaning]

39:47.200 --> 39:49.600
[James] She doesn't mean anything
to me. It was just sex.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.120
I was weak.

39:59.680 --> 40:00.880
[exhaling]

40:05.280 --> 40:06.120
[Olivia] James.

40:08.840 --> 40:09.720
[James] She trusts me.

40:14.400 --> 40:15.440
[Olivia breathing heavily]

40:21.720 --> 40:22.960
I'm still in love with you.

40:23.040 --> 40:24.880
-[elevator bell dings]
-[Olivia moaning]

40:25.520 --> 40:26.400
Sophie!

40:28.680 --> 40:30.400
[music crescendos]

40:39.360 --> 40:41.360
[music fades]

40:42.680 --> 40:44.680
[ending theme song playing]
