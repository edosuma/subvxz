00:02.160 --> 00:03.082
Previously on Arrow...

00:03.240 --> 00:04.446
I got an ID on our Mr. Creepy.

00:04.680 --> 00:06.409
<i>- I'm not sure what that symbol means.
- It means "anarchy."</i>

00:06.600 --> 00:08.204
<i>Lonnie Machin.
Full-time crazy-pants.</i>

00:13.560 --> 00:14.925
Speedy, don't!

00:20.040 --> 00:22.964
Sometimes the best way to teach someone
a lesson isn't to punish them.

00:23.120 --> 00:25.691
<i>It's to punish the ones
he cares about the most.</i>

00:25.920 --> 00:27.126
Felicity Smoak...

00:28.280 --> 00:32.604
Would you make me the happiest man
on the face of the Earth?

00:32.800 --> 00:34.086
Yes.

01:07.160 --> 01:11.006
Now I know that it's not my fault.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.004
It's my responsibility.

01:15.320 --> 01:17.004
Responsibility to do what?

01:17.840 --> 01:19.080
To end it.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.490
I'm gonna kill him.

01:27.920 --> 01:30.002
Where is Damien Darhk?

01:49.880 --> 01:53.043
Where's Darhk? Where is Darhk?

02:17.040 --> 02:18.371
Any luck?

02:18.560 --> 02:21.245
Just more Ghosts
who would rather die than talk.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.645
Nobody, nobody is gonna give up Darhk.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.164
John, we gotta talk to Andy again.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.368
I don't think Andy
is in a very cooperative place.

02:29.520 --> 02:30.567
Darhk has gone to ground.

02:30.720 --> 02:33.690
Right now, unless things change,
Andy is our best chance of catching him.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.922
Felicity's going in for another surgery.

02:36.160 --> 02:39.004
If we hurry, we might be able to see her
before she goes into prep.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.407
No, no. Darhk's in the wind.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.244
The longer he's there,
the harder he's gonna be to catch.

02:43.400 --> 02:46.609
I'm going to stay here,
find something useful from the tip line.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.602
It's what Felicity would want me to do.

02:53.080 --> 02:55.082
Can't lie your way out of this one, pal.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.163
Reiter might've bought your BS before,

02:57.400 --> 02:59.528
but now, between these maps

02:59.720 --> 03:03.281
and 0l' Miss Ukraine over here
still being alive,

03:04.280 --> 03:05.611
it's game over.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.403
He needs to rest for a moment.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.284
Don't care. Keep moving.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.566
And when he passes out,
do you plan on carrying him?

03:17.880 --> 03:19.609
Fine. Quick.

03:28.600 --> 03:32.730
Hey. You need to make a run for it.
I'll distract Conklin.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.809
By doing what? Bleeding on him?

03:36.120 --> 03:37.804
Well, isn't this touching.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.290
All right, come on, let's go.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.484
Don't get too attached to him, sweetheart.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.961
His prospects for a long life
don't look too good.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.286
Hey-

03:52.160 --> 03:53.446
Hey-

03:54.160 --> 03:55.161
How you feeling?

03:55.400 --> 03:56.765
I have never been more ready

03:57.000 --> 03:59.321
to have a bunch of guys
poking around inside me.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.646
Doctors.

04:01.920 --> 04:02.967
Doing doctor things.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.401
They, um...

04:05.640 --> 04:08.007
They think the last surgery
will fix the nerve damage, so...

04:08.160 --> 04:09.446
Mmm-hmm.

04:10.320 --> 04:11.685
These are from Oliver.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.687
Well, that's really nice
of him to stop by.

04:15.640 --> 04:16.687
Yeah, it's okay.

04:16.839 --> 04:21.368
I know he's doing everything he can
to track down the, uh, flowers.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.489
Which is much more important.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.523
Plus I got all the support
I need right here.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.011
<i>- Felicity?</i>
- Mmm?

04:28.360 --> 04:29.691
I'm here to prep you for surgery.

04:32.280 --> 04:34.681
I'm gonna be fine.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.600
Yeah.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.645
Aren't you tired of this?

04:38.880 --> 04:40.006
Same dead-end conversation.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.168
I'm not talking. I'm not helping.

04:42.360 --> 04:44.727
So how about you stop wasting
both our time?

04:47.480 --> 04:50.723
The Green Arrow told me to have
a conversation with you about Darhk.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.725
I'm surprised, John.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.564
I didn't think you had it in you.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.689
- I didn't.
- What changed?

05:00.880 --> 05:02.962
Her name is Felicity.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.404
Yeah, listen. I know, I know, all right?

05:14.560 --> 05:16.085
Just do...

05:17.080 --> 05:19.367
Listen, I gotta call you back,
call you back.

05:20.640 --> 05:21.687
How's she doing?

05:21.920 --> 05:23.046
She's in surgery again.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.571
Then what are you doing here?

05:24.760 --> 05:26.569
Looking for Damien Darhk.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.367
There's a card
that we haven't turned over yet.

05:29.560 --> 05:32.086
And we haven't turned it over
because when we do,

05:32.240 --> 05:33.685
he will know that you are working with us.

05:33.880 --> 05:35.609
You want to know where
I've been meeting with Darhk.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.086
Yeah.

05:37.760 --> 05:39.250
You won't be able to go home.

05:40.080 --> 05:43.084
Luckily, we have space in the bunker.
There are living quarters.

05:43.440 --> 05:45.841
- What about Laurel?
- She can take care of herself.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.366
Yeah, I've seen that.

05:47.600 --> 05:51.286
All right. Office building,
8326th Street, 30th floor.

05:51.520 --> 05:52.760
But with Felicity in the hospital,

05:53.040 --> 05:55.247
me and Laurel watching our backs,
your team gets mighty small.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.966
None of it matters
once Darhk is off the board.

05:58.520 --> 06:00.284
So you're back to dropping bodies?

06:02.400 --> 06:03.811
Just this one.

06:52.240 --> 06:53.605
Lonnie Machin.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.121
The symbol that I found at Darhk's lair
is consistent with the symbol

06:56.320 --> 06:59.164
that Machin left near the bodies
of two paramedics a few months ago.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.971
Okay. But why is Machin
still targeting Ghosts?

07:02.160 --> 07:03.685
When he kidnapped Danforth's daughter,

07:03.920 --> 07:05.251
Darhk was the one
who gave up his location.

07:05.480 --> 07:08.131
This is payback.
Darhk cleared out before Machin got there.

07:08.360 --> 07:12.604
Darhk is one step ahead of Machin,
but Machin is one step ahead of us.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.122
Yeah. And I'll keep chipping away
at my stone wall.

07:17.520 --> 07:21.525
Wait. How did you suddenly
find Darhk's base of operations?

07:21.840 --> 07:23.888
Finally had an interrogation
that went somewhere.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.525
I'm gonna bring up
everything I can on Machin.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.690
I'll ask my dad if SCPD found
any leads at the crime scene.

07:39.440 --> 07:42.887
Mr. Conklin,
I trust there is a reason for this?

07:43.560 --> 07:44.686
It's like I've been telling you.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.167
Queen's a liar.
He told me he'd killed this one.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.528
It turns out he's just been
keeping her stowed away.

07:49.720 --> 07:53.202
What you and your men do
to satisfy your needs outside of camp

07:53.360 --> 07:54.407
is no interest of mine.

07:54.560 --> 07:55.721
Yeah, I thought you might say that.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.530
That's why I made sure
to bring these with me.

07:58.720 --> 08:01.690
<i>I found these two coming up
from a shipwrecked freighter.</i>

08:01.880 --> 08:03.325
<i>Must've found them inside.</i>

08:03.520 --> 08:06.683
If he's been on this island
the whole time like he says,

08:07.360 --> 08:08.566
how'd he know where they were?

08:08.880 --> 08:09.927
I got those for you.

08:10.160 --> 08:13.403
For whatever it is
you're doing here.

08:13.840 --> 08:15.729
And yet you waited all this time.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.083
With someone you claimed to kill.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.403
I've defended you, Mr. Queen.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.887
At the cost of my credibility with my men.

08:24.240 --> 08:25.526
No more.

08:26.040 --> 08:27.769
You can kill him now if you like.

08:28.160 --> 08:30.766
No. I got something else in mind.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.408
<i>"TNANA". You can't do this!</i>

08:36.760 --> 08:38.125
You can't do this!

08:55.120 --> 08:56.360
How's Felicity?

08:56.640 --> 08:58.961
She's in surgery. It's a long procedure.

09:00.560 --> 09:01.925
<i>I'm gonna go to the hospital in a bit,</i>

09:02.120 --> 09:03.645
but I needed to come here
and get something first.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.120
What?

09:11.960 --> 09:13.644
I'd hate to see the other guy.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.131
The other guy's Andy.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.809
We had to
get information on Darhk.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.325
I thought that was Oliver's vendetta.

09:22.640 --> 09:23.880
Oliver does have a vendetta.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.724
I'm just trying to keep my friends safe.

09:26.320 --> 09:27.321
You feel betrayed.

09:27.560 --> 09:30.484
I do feel betrayed, Lyla.
He was my brother. My family.

09:30.640 --> 09:33.166
I think that's your problem.

09:33.560 --> 09:36.564
Ever since you heard about
what Andy did back in Afghanistan,

09:36.800 --> 09:38.848
Andy stopped being Andy to you.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.842
He became a traitor. The enemy.

09:42.080 --> 09:45.801
Yeah. And then he doubled down
and became one of Darhk's Ghosts.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.764
<i>And you've been treating him
like a Ghost ever since.</i>

09:47.960 --> 09:49.007
How's that working out for you?

09:49.160 --> 09:50.161
What's your point, Lyla?

09:50.360 --> 09:51.691
If you're not getting through
to Andy as a Ghost,

09:51.920 --> 09:53.524
maybe you should try
reaching him as your brother.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.000
No. No.

09:56.600 --> 09:57.647
I can't do that.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.080
Sure you can.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.209
I've seen the love you have
for your brother, Johnnie.

10:01.440 --> 10:03.363
The strength of it. It's iron.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.690
Before you give up on Andy,

10:06.360 --> 10:08.124
just make sure he sees what I do.

10:08.320 --> 10:11.529
A man who'd go to the ends of the Earth
for the ones he loves.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.360
And if it helps,

10:14.680 --> 10:17.047
consider it an order, soldier.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.211
_Are YOU doing okay?

10:26.360 --> 10:27.850
You mean now that Machin's back?

10:28.040 --> 10:29.565
I'm sure he's not after you.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.404
Why would he be?

10:31.560 --> 10:34.882
I only burned his face off
in a fiery fit of Lazarus rage.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.371
Thea.

10:37.560 --> 10:40.245
Look, you know those crime scene photos
that Ollie showed us,

10:40.480 --> 10:43.723
with paramedics
and the writing symbols in blood?

10:44.720 --> 10:47.564
Whoever is out there now
is a complete monster.

10:47.720 --> 10:49.848
A monster that we're going to catch.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.651
I don't know anymore.

10:52.160 --> 10:54.242
And lately,
I can't seem to win for losing.

10:54.560 --> 10:55.721
What do you mean?

10:55.920 --> 10:58.161
When we got John's brother outta HIVE,

10:59.480 --> 11:01.403
I ran into Damien Darhk.

11:02.560 --> 11:06.724
And he tried to use his
creepy magic mojo on me,

11:08.600 --> 11:12.241
but after that, my bloodlust was better.

11:12.760 --> 11:14.603
It was almost completely gone.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.043
I don't know. I really just thought

11:17.280 --> 11:19.089
I was starting to get on
the other side of this.

11:19.360 --> 11:22.523
Hey. Sounds like you already are.

11:22.840 --> 11:26.845
Except now, Machin's out there
and he has a bloodlust of his own.

11:28.280 --> 11:29.930
And it's completely my fault.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.963
No, Thea. You can't think that way.

11:32.120 --> 11:33.690
It's a little too late for that.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.246
Dad.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.202
What are you...

11:46.440 --> 11:51.241
I had no idea that Felicity's friend
was Quentin's daughter.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.247
It's such a small world.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.811
Microscopic.

11:59.960 --> 12:03.760
Um, Thea, I've been trying to get, um,
Donna to eat something at the cafeteria.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.564
But maybe you'd have better luck.

12:05.760 --> 12:06.807
Uh...

12:07.080 --> 12:09.481
Yeah. Yeah. Sure, sure. Come on.

12:09.640 --> 12:11.802
- Yeah, okay.
- All right, sweetheart. All right.

12:13.800 --> 12:17.088
I was gonna say something, but then,
with everything with Felicity and...

12:17.280 --> 12:19.169
Dad, Dad. It's fine.

12:19.400 --> 12:20.481
Really?

12:20.640 --> 12:21.846
I want you to be happy.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.323
Okay, so, Oliver found
Darhk's base of operations,

12:26.480 --> 12:28.482
and I'm guessing that's thanks to you?

12:28.760 --> 12:31.923
Well, there's no use being on the inside
if I can't provide inside intel, right?

12:32.120 --> 12:34.009
Darhk's going to realize
that you're helping the Green Arrow.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.525
I think that ship's
probably already sailed.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.286
Don't worry. I can look after myself.
I'm more worried about you.

12:38.520 --> 12:39.681
I thought we already worked past this.

12:39.840 --> 12:43.162
There's no working past a father
caring about his daughter.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.522
Mmm. Text from your new girlfriend?

12:47.680 --> 12:48.966
Easy. Get outta here.

12:50.360 --> 12:54.206
Crime lab. I had the handful of CSl's
I got working on the HIVE crime scene.

12:54.360 --> 12:55.850
I doubt they'll find anything.

12:56.040 --> 12:58.281
The Ghosts have their DNA scrambled.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.448
Which makes this particularly strange.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.646
The blood Machin used for his graffiti
didn't come from the Ghosts.

13:03.880 --> 13:04.881
How do you know?

13:05.120 --> 13:06.690
The CSU got a match.

13:07.440 --> 13:08.851
Two of them, actually.

13:11.560 --> 13:13.369
Michael and Crystal Olguin.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.846
Machin's foster parents.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.280
Kidnapped three days ago.

13:16.520 --> 13:17.726
Machin's settling old scores.

13:17.960 --> 13:21.567
He planted their blood at HIVE,
so clearly Darhk is next on his list.

13:21.720 --> 13:24.166
But Machin's gotta be laying low
somewhere, right?

13:24.400 --> 13:25.481
You think his former home?

13:25.680 --> 13:27.045
Well, I mean, it's vacant now.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.641
Yeah. Maybe they have
a security system we can hack into.

13:29.880 --> 13:31.166
I got it.

13:35.360 --> 13:37.010
- Or not.
- Here, <i>let</i> me try.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.246
Okay, wait, who's that?

13:42.560 --> 13:43.846
It's him.

13:44.560 --> 13:45.846
Suit up.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.567
Whoa. That's not at all creepy.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.603
The front's clear.

14:06.880 --> 14:11.283
Same. Except for trash, flies
and some bad graffiti.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.088
Wait. I think we might have something.

14:34.720 --> 14:36.643
I was expecting Mr. Darhk's friends,

14:36.800 --> 14:40.202
but you guys are a pleasant surprise.

14:42.560 --> 14:43.925
Especially you, dear.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.883
Hey! Don't move.

14:47.640 --> 14:50.803
Funny. I was gonna tell you
the same thing.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.445
It's on a motion sensor.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.491
Good.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.003
Oh, did you think I was going to kill you?

15:29.600 --> 15:31.284
Why would I do such a thing?

15:35.200 --> 15:37.601
You're the one who saved me from myself.

15:43.960 --> 15:47.601
Come on, then. Hit me with your best shot.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.370
Oh, that's pretty.

15:54.640 --> 15:55.721
You take voice lessons?

15:55.960 --> 15:57.564
No, Speedy! Stay away from her!

15:57.720 --> 15:59.563
Oh, I would never hurt her.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.290
You, on the other hand...

16:07.320 --> 16:08.890
Speedy, you okay?

16:09.560 --> 16:10.891
Now what?

16:11.640 --> 16:13.369
<i>We find out what he knows.</i>

16:25.920 --> 16:29.242
Aren't we risking some crazy
Bond villain stupidity here?

16:29.560 --> 16:34.168
I mean, this guy needs to be put away.
Far, far away.

16:34.360 --> 16:37.364
Machin found Darhk's base of operations
without any help.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.080
I need to know how,
I need to know where Darhk is right now,

16:40.360 --> 16:42.089
and the cops can have him
when I'm done with him.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.925
Machin is about
10 different kinds of deranged.

16:45.240 --> 16:46.765
Why would you believe
anything he tells you?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.604
'Cause I don't have any other choice.

16:48.760 --> 16:51.047
Now, lam done talking about this.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.411
Give me the room.

16:53.760 --> 16:54.921
Thought we'd moved past this.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.287
Sorry to disappoint. Wake up.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.725
Where's Damien Darhk?

17:01.440 --> 17:03.283
He went home.

17:05.079 --> 17:07.970
I was planning, you know, a party for him
when you interrupted my...

17:10.599 --> 17:11.806
Tell me where he is.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.290
Or what?

17:14.040 --> 17:15.451
Look at me.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.124
What can you possibly do
that I haven't already enjoyed?

17:21.440 --> 17:23.204
- Hey!
- Get out.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.641
No. Look, there's something
you need to hear.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.766
What?

17:34.400 --> 17:35.970
Felicity is out of surgery.

17:36.240 --> 17:37.287
Donna just texted me.

17:37.440 --> 17:41.161
Didn't say what was wrong,
but I don't think it's good.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.450
You need to go there.

17:50.560 --> 17:52.164
Hmm. Back for more?

17:52.440 --> 17:55.250
Does beating up on your little brother
give you a little thrill?

17:55.440 --> 17:56.805
I'm not proud of what I did, Andy.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.570
In fact, I'm ashamed of it.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.281
You, John? Mr. High and Mighty?

18:03.840 --> 18:09.006
Do you remember the last time
you beat on me until your knuckles bled?

18:11.080 --> 18:12.844
Yeah, I do. Ten years ago.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.161
When I found out you were dealing.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.931
Yeah. You convinced me to enlist.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.688
To go the straight and narrow
like my big bro.

18:23.120 --> 18:25.851
And I tried. Honestly, I tried, man.

18:26.360 --> 18:27.805
Enough to fool you.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.971
That's just not who I was.

18:30.520 --> 18:33.046
'Cause it's always been about you, John.

18:33.200 --> 18:36.682
Because I'm such an embarrassment,
my bad deeds look bad on you.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.883
No, Andy, no. That's not true.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.441
I did what I did because I love you, man.

18:41.800 --> 18:46.169
No, I do, Andy. Then, now.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.123
Andy, you're still my little brother,
who I stayed up late playing cards with.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.808
You going through this, that's on me.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.327
But do you really think Damien Darhk
gives a damn about you?

18:57.560 --> 19:00.040
He believes that the world needs a reset.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.050
And honestly, John, after
what we witnessed in Afghanistan,

19:03.240 --> 19:04.730
can you tell me otherwise?

19:06.520 --> 19:08.409
Okay. All right, so you and Darhk

19:08.640 --> 19:09.846
are burning the village
in order to save it.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.081
I get that.

19:11.240 --> 19:13.242
Malcolm Merlyn was talking the same tune.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.722
But, Andy, Darhk hurt a friend of mine.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.320
A close friend.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.407
A woman better than you
and me put together.

19:21.520 --> 19:23.045
It doesn't matter if Darhk
wants to save the world.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.605
He crossed a line!

19:26.400 --> 19:27.606
So I'm asking you, Andy,

19:27.760 --> 19:29.410
begging you, man,

19:31.320 --> 19:32.606
brother to brother,

19:33.840 --> 19:35.205
where can I find Darhk?

19:40.040 --> 19:41.451
He, uh,

19:43.880 --> 19:46.281
likes to talk about Stonehaven.

19:48.280 --> 19:52.126
About how the leaves look there in autumn.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.600
Thanks, Andy.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.451
Don't thank me.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.290
You're ashamed?

20:00.600 --> 20:01.931
Now we're even.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.042
Speedy.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.488
That is what the blonde
with the black leather

20:12.640 --> 20:15.610
and the big mouth called you, right?

20:16.280 --> 20:18.328
Hard to look at me, I know.

20:19.120 --> 20:21.441
Your doing. I owe you a thank you.

20:21.640 --> 20:24.769
Baptism by fire. It's transcendent.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.649
You burnt away my weakness,

20:27.920 --> 20:31.322
like a phoenix rising from the ashes.

20:31.560 --> 20:35.326
If you thought burning your face off
was fun, keep talking.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.005
Put an arrow through your eye.

20:38.160 --> 20:39.491
So why hold back?

20:41.600 --> 20:42.840
I know you want to kill me.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.083
Because I can control myself.

20:46.280 --> 20:47.850
No, you can't.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.480
You think you can, you say you can,

20:51.000 --> 20:52.684
but I can see it in your eyes.

20:52.920 --> 20:55.321
The hunger to deliver death.

20:56.840 --> 20:58.080
Ah, delicious.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.327
Told you.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.646
Bye, dean

21:13.000 --> 21:16.641
<i>Coming to you live now
from downtown Star City, where the SCPD</i>

21:16.840 --> 21:19.844
<i>has apprehended a fugitive wanted
for murder and kidnapping charges...</i>

21:20.200 --> 21:22.168
- Hi, Donna.
- Where have you been?

21:22.880 --> 21:25.611
I... I should have been here.

21:27.040 --> 21:29.361
Thea said that Felicity is out of surgery.

21:29.960 --> 21:34.010
Yeah, yeah. She's, uh, well,
she's got a new diagnosis.

21:34.720 --> 21:36.131
What?

21:37.200 --> 21:38.531
They can't...

21:39.200 --> 21:40.531
They can't fix her.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.564
What do you mean, they can't fix her?

21:46.240 --> 21:48.527
The damage to her spinal cord, it's...

21:50.400 --> 21:51.731
Oliver, it's permanent.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.404
She's never gonna walk again.

21:55.080 --> 21:58.801
No. No. No. We'll talk to another doctor.

21:59.040 --> 22:00.644
No, no, no. See, you don't...

22:00.880 --> 22:02.086
This...

22:02.320 --> 22:03.367
This is the other doctor, okay?

22:03.560 --> 22:06.404
This is the doctor that came
all the way from Central City.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.922
This is... This is the doctor.

22:10.200 --> 22:12.726
Where is she? I need to see her.

22:12.920 --> 22:14.160
She's in recovery.

22:14.360 --> 22:15.850
<i>In</i> a <i>special report, Lonnie Machin</i>

22:16.040 --> 22:18.611
<i>has just been apprehended
by the Star City Police Department.</i>

22:19.080 --> 22:21.924
<i>D.A. Laurel Lance was onsite
to oversee his containment.</i>

22:35.760 --> 22:37.091
Stop!

22:37.400 --> 22:38.447
What?

22:38.600 --> 22:39.931
Stop.

22:43.440 --> 22:45.124
You said he was mine
to do whatever I want with.

22:45.280 --> 22:48.443
That was before I saw the signs.
On his abdomen.

22:53.760 --> 22:54.807
Mmm.

22:54.960 --> 22:57.247
Well, you can look at it
all you want after he's dead.

22:58.600 --> 22:59.806
But I have need of him.

23:02.080 --> 23:04.481
No! No! No! Everyone stay back!

23:06.120 --> 23:08.122
Well, I count five guns.

23:08.640 --> 23:09.926
You got one.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.768
What you gonna do? You can't run.

23:17.160 --> 23:18.730
I'm not running.

23:34.840 --> 23:36.126
Ah, long time no see.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.129
We didn't finish our conversation.

23:38.320 --> 23:41.324
And, what, I'm supposed to be so grateful,

23:41.520 --> 23:44.364
I'm just gonna give up what I know
about where Darhk is?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.365
Not likely.

23:59.360 --> 24:01.044
You make sure he's dead.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.363
Have you
completely lost your mind?

24:15.520 --> 24:16.851
I don't have time for a debate.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.361
Good, because there's nothing to debate.
What you did is...

24:19.560 --> 24:20.971
What I did?

24:22.280 --> 24:25.409
I did what I had to do,
after you made it necessary.

24:26.400 --> 24:29.324
Machin was only arrested by the SCPD
because you gave him up.

24:29.520 --> 24:33.411
You were holding a man prisoner
as some sort of personal vendetta.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.041
Do you have any idea
how many people Damien Darhk

24:36.320 --> 24:38.368
and HIVE have killed
over the past six months?

24:39.640 --> 24:42.246
This might be a vendetta,
but it's not personal.

24:43.680 --> 24:44.920
I don't know what's worse.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.641
You actually believe that
or you expect me to.

24:47.880 --> 24:49.405
I put a tracker on Machin.

24:49.560 --> 24:52.245
He will lead us to Darhk,
and then we will take both of them down.

24:52.480 --> 24:54.084
And when your master plan doesn't work,

24:54.240 --> 24:57.244
you just sent a murdering psychotic
back on the streets.

24:57.760 --> 24:59.330
Like you did with Sara?

25:00.680 --> 25:01.920
That's not fair.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.361
What's going on?

25:03.600 --> 25:06.080
Oliver broke Machin out of custody.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.568
- What?
- I'm using Machin to get to Darhk.

25:08.760 --> 25:10.000
Peflod.

25:10.600 --> 25:13.604
If either of you has a problem with it,
you know where the door is.

25:15.080 --> 25:16.923
Laurel, give us a second.

25:19.920 --> 25:21.445
I don't have time for a lecture, John.

25:21.600 --> 25:22.681
There's no lecture here, Oliver.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.450
But you should know that
Andy gave me a lead on Darhk.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.443
- And I've been working on it.
- Good. What have you found?

25:26.600 --> 25:27.681
Unfortunately, it was a dead end.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.604
- But you should also...
- But nothing. But nothing.

25:29.760 --> 25:30.966
<i>Oliver, I know you're hurting, man.</i>

25:31.120 --> 25:33.248
But you should know
that whatever your play is,

25:34.080 --> 25:35.809
- I got your back.
- But?

25:36.200 --> 25:37.565
But you've come so far, Oliver.

25:38.440 --> 25:42.923
You've recovered a humanity
that you'd lost when I first met you.

25:43.440 --> 25:45.647
I know you want payback
for what Darhk did to Felicity,

25:45.880 --> 25:47.041
and you should.

25:47.240 --> 25:49.811
But don't lose what made her
fall in love with you in the first place.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.484
Oh. Hey.

26:01.720 --> 26:02.767
What are you doing here?

26:02.960 --> 26:04.928
I came by to tell you, um...

26:07.440 --> 26:08.646
I can't do this.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.571
My "anger management issues,"

26:14.160 --> 26:16.003
they are less manageable than I thought.

26:16.640 --> 26:20.167
Look, I called what's going on with you
"anger management" because

26:20.400 --> 26:22.323
I don't know what else to call it.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.086
All I know is that there's something
that's really bothering you.

26:25.320 --> 26:28.642
And if I know what it is,
maybe I can help.

26:29.600 --> 26:30.840
You can't.

26:31.960 --> 26:34.964
This... This can't really be helped.

26:35.680 --> 26:36.841
I don't believe that.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.331
I don't believe that for a second.

26:38.520 --> 26:41.842
Thea, you've lived through more tragedies
than a person has any right to,

26:42.120 --> 26:44.009
but instead of crumbling, here you are,

26:44.280 --> 26:46.328
every single day,
working to rebuild your home.

26:46.680 --> 26:49.206
- You've got steel inside of you, Thea.
- Huh.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.488
That's what drew me to you
in the first place.

26:53.960 --> 26:56.042
Thank you. I'm...

26:57.520 --> 26:58.851
Just not ready.

26:59.480 --> 27:02.211
Well, hey, when you are, I'll be here.

27:03.360 --> 27:04.691
Hmm.

27:05.280 --> 27:06.566
Okay.

27:18.480 --> 27:21.563
Oh, boy. What did I miss?

27:21.960 --> 27:23.689
<i>Well, it's a long story.</i>

27:23.960 --> 27:27.203
Short version, Machin's gotten loose,
he's after Darhk, and we're tracking him.

27:27.400 --> 27:30.563
Wait. What? What happens
if he gets out and starts hurting people?

27:30.720 --> 27:32.722
- That's exactly my point.
- It doesn't matter.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.081
You sound like him.

27:34.640 --> 27:37.644
No, I mean the tracker's gone dark.
I mean, we just lost his signal.

27:37.920 --> 27:40.321
He must have found the tracker.
We lost him.

27:42.360 --> 27:45.170
Okay, so what do we do now?

27:45.360 --> 27:46.771
I don't know.

27:48.600 --> 27:49.931
That was the whole plan.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.085
Oliver, go see Felicity.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.765
Not right now, John. Not when we're...

27:53.920 --> 27:55.524
<i>Then when? Then when, Oliver?</i>

27:55.760 --> 27:57.046
She needs you.

27:57.760 --> 28:00.240
And right now,
I think you need her too.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.205
We will find Machin.

28:03.440 --> 28:06.762
Look, they are right, okay?

28:06.920 --> 28:08.922
We are going to figure this out.

28:10.760 --> 28:14.765
But right now,
you need to go and be with her.

28:27.360 --> 28:28.646
Hey, stranger.

28:35.800 --> 28:39.964
Sorry I didn't come by sooner. It's...

28:41.720 --> 28:42.801
It's unforgivable.

28:43.040 --> 28:45.168
Only if you were in Bali or something.

28:46.960 --> 28:47.961
Were you in Bali?

28:48.160 --> 28:49.491
No, I was, uh...

28:49.640 --> 28:50.926
Beating the streets?

28:51.480 --> 28:53.608
Probably a lot of people
looking for Darhk.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.087
I didn't want to come see you
until Darhk was off the board.

28:56.280 --> 28:57.486
Any luck?

28:59.080 --> 29:00.491
We're working some leads.

29:00.920 --> 29:02.649
Tell me you haven't gone off the rails.

29:04.280 --> 29:05.486
Well...

29:08.840 --> 29:10.126
It's just...

29:12.160 --> 29:13.969
I can't help but think that

29:15.480 --> 29:17.164
the reason that Darhk is winning

29:17.440 --> 29:20.011
is because I haven't been willing
to go far enough.

29:20.160 --> 29:23.687
And that if I was, if I had,

29:24.160 --> 29:26.367
maybe you wouldn't be in here right now.

29:28.160 --> 29:34.042
And I don't know what the point of
what I'm doing as Green Arrow is

29:36.000 --> 29:38.526
if I can't protect the people
that are closest to me.

29:38.680 --> 29:41.604
What was the point of doing it
if you lose yourself in the process?

29:41.840 --> 29:43.046
Yeah.

29:43.200 --> 29:45.168
There's something else
we need to talk about.

29:45.800 --> 29:47.131
The doctors,

29:48.120 --> 29:50.851
they say that I'm... Uh...

29:51.440 --> 29:52.726
I know.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.202
My point being is
we didn't really exchange any vows,

29:55.360 --> 29:57.727
so the whole "for better, for worse"
thing doesn't really apply here.

29:57.960 --> 29:59.405
What are you talking about?

29:59.560 --> 30:01.642
That maybe the real reason
you haven't been here is because...

30:01.840 --> 30:03.205
Felicity.

30:08.560 --> 30:11.882
The nurse, she took this
off of you in the ER.

30:13.360 --> 30:14.566
How dare she.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.240
For better or for worse.

30:25.080 --> 30:26.366
Yeah.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.087
He's bluffing.

30:38.240 --> 30:40.766
Reiter, I can help you find what you need,

30:41.400 --> 30:42.845
on one condition.

30:43.600 --> 30:44.726
What do you want?

30:44.920 --> 30:46.160
I want Taiana's safety.

30:47.440 --> 30:50.444
So long as she is alive, I'll cooperate.

30:51.080 --> 30:52.764
He's manipulating you.

30:53.280 --> 30:55.442
What do you think he's been doing
this whole time?

30:55.600 --> 30:57.568
You give him what he wants,
he's gonna turn on you.

30:57.760 --> 30:59.046
Do we have a deal or not?

31:07.360 --> 31:08.725
Take them both to prison.

31:12.360 --> 31:13.646
You can't trust him!

31:15.440 --> 31:16.805
Remember, Conklin,

31:17.640 --> 31:20.564
there's no part of my plan
which requires you to be alive.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.330
When we go out every night,

31:38.320 --> 31:40.243
<i>suiting up, risking our lives,</i>

31:41.440 --> 31:43.488
fighting assassins and meta-humans,

31:43.640 --> 31:45.642
<i>and all the worst kinds of people,</i>

31:46.440 --> 31:47.965
she's stronger than all of us.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.809
You won't get an argument from me.

31:53.160 --> 31:54.491
Oliver, we might have something.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.763
John's brother said Darhk could be found
at a place called "Stonehaven."

31:58.160 --> 31:59.685
Dig said that lead was a dead end.

31:59.840 --> 32:03.003
That was before we cross-referenced
the tracker's location

32:03.160 --> 32:05.766
and came back with a residential address.

32:06.120 --> 32:08.168
Machin's going after Darhk where he lives.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.646
We're gonna roll out.

32:09.920 --> 32:12.651
I thought you might want to tag along.

32:13.640 --> 32:14.846
Thank you.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.000
Let's go.

32:23.440 --> 32:26.489
All righty. I just spoke with Mr. Darhk.

32:26.880 --> 32:28.530
He's on his way.

32:30.440 --> 32:32.647
Traffic's a bitch.

32:33.280 --> 32:34.486
Could take a while.

32:34.720 --> 32:39.169
I really don't see why we can't have
some fun in the meanwhile.

32:44.040 --> 32:46.884
Just so you know, this isn't your fault.

32:48.640 --> 32:51.041
You see, Daddy done me wrong.

32:51.400 --> 32:53.368
There needs to be recompense for that.

32:54.720 --> 32:57.883
He's not responsible for what
happened to my face.

32:58.840 --> 33:01.241
Not directly. But incidentally.

33:02.200 --> 33:03.565
<i>And isn't that what anarchy is?</i>

33:03.800 --> 33:07.486
The intersection of seemingly
unconnected events?

33:19.080 --> 33:20.161
Who owns the house?

33:20.360 --> 33:21.771
It's owned by a dummy corporation.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.367
Couldn't work through
all the layers without Felicity.

33:24.600 --> 33:26.602
And we're sure
that Machin's inside?

33:28.560 --> 33:29.766
Oh, yeah.

33:31.680 --> 33:32.761
We're sure.

33:32.920 --> 33:34.251
Hey-

33:48.400 --> 33:49.606
Get on the ground!

33:49.880 --> 33:53.441
First, you catch me,
then you break me out,

33:53.680 --> 33:55.808
now you wanna catch me again.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.090
Make up your mind!

33:58.640 --> 33:59.880
Stick him.

34:05.400 --> 34:06.640
Get them out of here!

34:07.440 --> 34:09.806
You're gonna be okay.
Just come with us.

34:26.159 --> 34:27.650
_5plit UP-_0kay-

35:04.680 --> 35:05.966
There it is.

35:06.680 --> 35:08.364
Shut up.

35:08.680 --> 35:14.210
A little piece of me inside of you
just begging to come out and play.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.565
Where's my family?

35:30.880 --> 35:32.120
I saved them.

35:37.800 --> 35:39.325
I want to be clear about something.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.810
I have shown you repeatedly
that you cannot beat me.

35:43.480 --> 35:45.084
You saved my family.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.721
So I'll give you a few weeks
to spend with yours.

35:49.240 --> 35:50.526
Enjoy your time.

35:51.560 --> 35:53.005
What's left of it.

35:57.560 --> 35:58.891
You missed.

35:59.480 --> 36:00.766
<i>On purpose.</i>

36:01.920 --> 36:03.331
I'm disappointed in you.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.887
Are Darhk's wife
and daughter in police custody?

36:27.120 --> 36:29.600
They told police
they weren't his wife and daughter.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.250
Had fake ID and everything.

36:31.880 --> 36:33.120
Speedy,

36:34.040 --> 36:35.121
you okay?

36:35.280 --> 36:36.566
Yeah.

36:37.120 --> 36:38.963
I'm just sorry I let Machin get away.

36:39.120 --> 36:40.565
I'm just glad that you're all right.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.443
I'm gonna go see Felicity.

36:50.280 --> 36:53.363
Chinese used this island as a prison.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.410
Bet you didn't know that.

36:56.080 --> 36:58.890
They said being sentenced here
was worse than any hell.

36:59.320 --> 37:02.927
Guess I'll just have to see if I can give
those Chinese a run for their money.

37:08.160 --> 37:10.162
Reiter's gonna get through
with you eventually.

37:10.600 --> 37:12.648
Then you and me'll have
a little uninterrupted time.

37:19.560 --> 37:20.846
You've lost a lot of blood.

37:23.120 --> 37:25.248
You shouldn't let these wounds
sit open like that.

37:25.560 --> 37:26.846
Thank you.

37:27.280 --> 37:28.930
You saved my life again.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.330
Nearly at the expense of your own.

37:31.640 --> 37:32.846
No.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.525
You didn't deserve to die.

37:36.240 --> 37:37.526
You're a good man.

37:38.160 --> 37:39.650
My brother would have liked you.

37:47.840 --> 37:50.161
I already told you
everything I know, John.

37:50.360 --> 37:53.284
I'm not here
to ask any questions, Andy.

38:13.160 --> 38:14.730
Thank you for coming.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.885
Yeah. I'm glad I did.

38:19.040 --> 38:20.280
And glad you called.

38:22.040 --> 38:24.520
<i>You know, this is
a little bit confusing. Uh...</i>

38:24.720 --> 38:25.960
Yeah.

38:26.360 --> 38:28.886
First we're on, then we're off,
now we're...

38:29.160 --> 38:30.969
- Drinking wine.
- Drinking wine.

38:33.240 --> 38:38.406
Look, um,
something happened earlier today,

38:39.840 --> 38:42.923
and I guess I just wanted to say
that you were right.

38:44.640 --> 38:47.086
I am stronger than I think I am.

38:47.840 --> 38:51.242
Well, uh, here's to being stronger, huh?

39:00.840 --> 39:01.887
Mmm.

39:02.040 --> 39:03.087
How you feeling?

39:03.240 --> 39:04.924
How long you been sitting there?

39:05.280 --> 39:06.611
Not long enough.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.206
Sorry I went away.

39:09.440 --> 39:11.761
I think you apologized already.

39:12.760 --> 39:14.922
Nowhere near done apologizing.

39:18.120 --> 39:21.761
You know, I think I wanna go to Bali.

39:22.280 --> 39:23.566
Yeah.

39:23.920 --> 39:25.126
Wanna come with me?

39:26.600 --> 39:27.886
Yeah.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.045
I'd go anywhere with you.

39:30.240 --> 39:31.287
Yeah.

39:31.440 --> 39:32.805
Just one question.

39:32.960 --> 39:34.086
Mmm-hmm?

39:34.280 --> 39:36.442
What's Damien Darhk doing in Bali?

39:37.920 --> 39:39.968
I only ask 'cause if he's still here,

39:41.800 --> 39:43.131
we have some work to do.

39:44.200 --> 39:45.929
How did you get to be so strong?

39:48.640 --> 39:50.404
I take my lead from you.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.165
Shh.

40:03.640 --> 40:06.120
I've bought out the Fairmont
for the month.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.926
You'll be safe there
until we find a new home.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.569
And what about the man that attacked us?

40:12.400 --> 40:13.925
Lonnie Machin?

40:14.440 --> 40:15.487
He'll never hurt you again.

40:15.680 --> 40:17.682
Those vigilantes saved us.

40:20.280 --> 40:23.966
My dearest Ruvé, do I detect
a note of criticism in your voice?

40:24.520 --> 40:27.842
Yes, but not the one you think.

40:29.440 --> 40:31.363
You should have killed
the Green Arrow tonight.

40:31.840 --> 40:33.968
As you said, he saved your life.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.964
It would be bad form to take him out now.

40:37.520 --> 40:40.683
Genesis is almost ready.
We're much too close to play games.

40:41.200 --> 40:42.531
Do you remember what I promised you?

40:43.320 --> 40:44.685
A new beginning.

40:46.120 --> 40:47.360
And you will have it.

40:48.520 --> 40:50.887
Once we've brought this world to its end.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.091
Are you okay?

41:25.720 --> 41:27.051
Are you?

41:31.080 --> 41:32.366
No.

41:33.240 --> 41:35.208
You know what you have to do, right?

41:37.480 --> 41:39.608
You have to kill the son of a bitch.

42:09.880 --> 42:10.881
English - SDH
