00:01.440 --> 00:02.710
<b><i>But you know...</i></b>

00:02.710 --> 00:08.560
<b><i>After you told me, an octopus, 
that I was a cool guy...</i></b>

00:09.420 --> 00:11.700
<b><i>After you said we could be friends...</i></b>

00:13.260 --> 00:15.740
<b><i>I couldn't let you die!</i></b>

00:20.030 --> 00:21.870
<b>I'm gonna save you!</b>

00:22.110 --> 00:25.000
<b>Don't die on me!</b>

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
<b>Power x And x Games</b>

01:51.470 --> 01:55.970
<b>While Killua was being rescued 
by the Chimera Ant Ikalgo,</b>

01:55.970 --> 01:58.120
<b>his supposed enemy,</b>

01:58.950 --> 02:04.990
<b>Gon, too, was forming a bond with 
a Chimera Ant called Meleoron.</b>

02:14.440 --> 02:16.850
<b>You should stop smoking.</b>

02:18.080 --> 02:20.760
<b>If the smoke sticks to you,</b>

02:20.760 --> 02:24.280
<b>people can smell you coming, and it'll 
waste your ability to become invisible.</b>

02:25.360 --> 02:27.400
<b>I appreciate the warning.</b>

02:27.400 --> 02:29.750
<b>But honestly, that doesn't matter.</b>

02:30.010 --> 02:33.020
<b>While my invisibility is a sort of calling card,</b>

02:33.020 --> 02:35.890
<b>my real power is on an entirely different level.</b>

02:37.940 --> 02:39.360
<b>Just watch.</b>

02:45.130 --> 02:48.650
<b><i>Huh?! He vanished in an instant...</i></b>

02:49.890 --> 02:51.440
<b><i>I can't sense him at all.</i></b>

02:52.010 --> 02:53.770
<b><i>Only the smell of cigarettes.</i></b>

02:56.580 --> 02:57.600
<b><i>He's gone...</i></b>

02:58.100 --> 03:00.030
<b><i>This isn't mere invisibility.</i></b>

03:01.030 --> 03:02.880
<b><i>Does he also have the ability</i></b>

03:02.880 --> 03:06.920
<b><i>to change locations instantly, 
without making any sound?</i></b>

03:07.440 --> 03:08.650
<b><i>That isn't possible!</i></b>

03:09.190 --> 03:10.580
<b><i>How did he do it?!</i></b>

03:13.490 --> 03:14.960
<b>Where'd you come from?</b>

03:16.460 --> 03:18.380
<b>I've been here the entire time.</b>

03:18.630 --> 03:19.550
<b>Huh?</b>

03:19.550 --> 03:23.200
<b>My second ability is Perfect Plan.</b>

03:23.370 --> 03:30.810
<b>God's Alibi
Perfect Plan</b>

03:25.130 --> 03:27.570
<b>When I hold my breath,</b>

03:27.570 --> 03:30.810
<b>no one can sense my existence.</b>

03:31.120 --> 03:34.560
<b>You were even touching me...</b>

03:34.560 --> 03:37.820
<b>But your mind didn't realize it.</b>

03:37.820 --> 03:39.940
<b>Eh? I touched you?</b>

03:41.790 --> 03:44.330
<b>You know how some people are easily overlooked?</b>

03:44.330 --> 03:46.490
<b>When you go to a restaurant in a group,</b>

03:46.490 --> 03:49.760
<b>there's always one person that the 
waitress forgets to bring water.</b>

03:49.760 --> 03:51.830
<b>This is an extreme version.</b>

03:51.830 --> 03:55.710
<b>I'm right here, but no one notices me.</b>

03:55.710 --> 03:56.840
<b>Oh...</b>

03:57.350 --> 04:00.920
<b>I use my other ability to turn invisible</b>

04:00.920 --> 04:05.000
<b>to cover this one so no one can learn about it.</b>

04:05.550 --> 04:10.700
<b>For the record, you and I are 
the only ones in the world</b>

04:11.760 --> 04:13.440
<b>who know this.</b>

04:15.780 --> 04:18.050
<b>Why tell me something so important?</b>

04:18.540 --> 04:21.540
<b>Well, it's to build trust.</b>

04:21.540 --> 04:24.840
<b>Since I'm the one who has to take a risk...</b>

04:25.190 --> 04:29.030
<b>If I can't convince you to trust me, 
we can't start anything.</b>

04:29.400 --> 04:32.540
<b>You mean, what you said about 
me being a valuable partner?</b>

04:32.860 --> 04:36.300
<b>Yeah, but that's for later.</b>

04:38.280 --> 04:41.580
<b>Like I said, we have to trust each other first.</b>

04:41.580 --> 04:46.550
<b>Once you've agreed to be my 
partner, I'll tell you more.</b>

04:46.720 --> 04:48.390
<b>Okay, I'll be your partner.</b>

04:49.140 --> 04:49.970
<b>That was fast!</b>

04:50.920 --> 04:53.080
<b>You don't know how to bargain, kid.</b>

04:53.080 --> 04:55.180
<b>Don't be so trusting of me!</b>

04:55.180 --> 04:56.150
<b>Suspect everyone!</b>

04:56.150 --> 04:58.440
<b>Until you've done due diligence, 
don't trust anyone!</b>

04:58.440 --> 04:59.250
<b>Huh?</b>

04:59.250 --> 05:01.610
<b>I said it's okay, so why are 
you being so difficult?</b>

05:01.610 --> 05:04.660
<b>Can you even make this decision on your own?!</b>

05:04.660 --> 05:05.900
<b>What about your buddy?</b>

05:05.900 --> 05:07.180
<b>He'll have a fit</b>

05:07.180 --> 05:10.870
<b>when he hears you teamed up with 
a suspicious-looking monster...</b>

05:12.440 --> 05:15.050
<b>And why am I insulting myself?</b>

05:15.050 --> 05:18.240
<b>I didn't choose to be this way!</b>

05:18.240 --> 05:20.420
<b><i>He talks a lot...</i></b>

05:21.370 --> 05:22.800
<b>Whatever.</b>

05:23.450 --> 05:27.430
<b>Even a friend of twenty years 
could stab you in the back.</b>

05:27.620 --> 05:30.170
<b>Time is no measure of trust!</b>

05:30.170 --> 05:32.180
<b>Say, "Ho"!</b>

05:33.140 --> 05:35.320
<b>You're no fun...</b>

05:35.800 --> 05:37.250
<b>We can never be friends.</b>

05:37.790 --> 05:39.940
<b><i>I feel the same way...</i></b>

05:41.120 --> 05:43.390
<b>Then, are you sure about this?</b>

05:43.390 --> 05:44.350
<b>About what?</b>

05:44.350 --> 05:46.190
<b>About teaming up with me.</b>

05:46.190 --> 05:48.280
<b>Won't your buddy object?</b>

05:48.790 --> 05:50.570
<b>Most likely.</b>

05:50.570 --> 05:52.790
<b>Because he tends to be cautious 
and to question everything.</b>

05:53.320 --> 05:54.790
<b>This won't work, then.</b>

05:54.790 --> 05:56.870
<b>The deal's dead in the water.</b>

05:57.270 --> 06:00.580
<b>But if I insist on having my way, it'll be fine.</b>

06:00.580 --> 06:02.980
<b>Killua won't like it, but he'll give in.</b>

06:03.940 --> 06:07.380
<b>Really... He must have a hard time.</b>

06:07.970 --> 06:11.780
<b>Well, whatever. 
If you say it's okay, I'll trust you.</b>

06:11.780 --> 06:13.360
<b>So let's get to business.</b>

06:13.360 --> 06:14.070
<b>Yeah.</b>

06:16.980 --> 06:18.770
<b>I want to defeat the King.</b>

06:21.010 --> 06:22.800
<b>Want to know why?</b>

06:22.800 --> 06:24.900
<b>Yeah, of course.</b>

06:25.510 --> 06:27.270
<b><i>That's what I've been waiting for...</i></b>

06:28.360 --> 06:29.800
<b>Revenge.</b>

06:33.220 --> 06:37.260
<b>Right now, I can't tell you 
why I want revenge...</b>

06:37.260 --> 06:38.080
<b>Okay.</b>

06:38.080 --> 06:40.240
<b>I'd like to know, but I'll wait.</b>

06:40.630 --> 06:42.690
<b><i>That's probably what he wants to hear...</i></b>

06:43.950 --> 06:46.910
<b>If you're that curious, I'll tell you.</b>

06:46.910 --> 06:48.050
<b>You'll tell me now?!</b>

06:48.050 --> 06:49.870
<b>Just kidding!</b>

06:49.870 --> 06:52.680
<b>Beg all you want, but I won't tell you now.</b>

06:52.680 --> 06:54.430
<b>I didn't beg you for anything.</b>

07:01.170 --> 07:03.400
<b>The King killed someone I owed my life to.</b>

07:04.960 --> 07:06.680
<b>His name was Peggy.</b>

07:07.330 --> 07:10.320
<b>I saw the King behead him right before my eyes.</b>

07:13.490 --> 07:17.830
<b>But at the time, I didn't realize 
what had happened.</b>

07:18.320 --> 07:19.860
<b>Huh? Why not?</b>

07:19.860 --> 07:21.780
<b>You saw it happen, didn't you?</b>

07:27.360 --> 07:30.720
<b>Because I'd forgotten that Peggy</b>

07:31.160 --> 07:33.940
<b>was the one who raised me.</b>

07:40.170 --> 07:45.980
<b>A little while ago, I began to recover my 
memories from when I was human.</b>

07:47.330 --> 07:49.580
<b>I haven't remembered everything.</b>

07:51.540 --> 07:53.300
<b>No, I should rephrase that...</b>

07:53.780 --> 07:56.260
<b>I've only remembered a few things.</b>

07:56.680 --> 08:01.750
<b>The names of my parents, my name, 
episodes from my childhood.</b>

08:02.520 --> 08:06.120
<b>Peggy was the name of the 
Chimera Ant the King killed.</b>

08:06.900 --> 08:11.110
<b>That was also my foster father's human name.</b>

08:12.000 --> 08:16.970
<b>He was into education, and always 
carried thick books around.</b>

08:20.650 --> 08:25.730
<b>In both life and death, he never 
parted with his books about NGL.</b>

08:26.630 --> 08:29.730
<b>Then you all have memories 
from when you were human?</b>

08:29.730 --> 08:32.240
<b>I don't know if we're all the same.</b>

08:32.580 --> 08:36.530
<b>Some Chimera Ants are clearly feral in nature.</b>

08:36.530 --> 08:39.340
<b>With others, there's no 
telling what they're thinking.</b>

08:39.340 --> 08:41.530
<b>But I think I understand now.</b>

08:42.840 --> 08:47.250
<b>This is why, when we first met, 
I was willing to trust you.</b>

08:48.270 --> 08:50.160
<b>You're very human.</b>

08:50.620 --> 08:53.050
<b>More human than any other 
Chimera Ant I've met.</b>

08:53.460 --> 08:56.220
<b>In fact, I'd say you're still human.</b>

08:56.590 --> 09:00.800
<b>Really? When I met you, 
I had the opposite reaction.</b>

09:00.800 --> 09:01.750
<b>Huh?</b>

09:01.750 --> 09:05.810
<b>I could sense a vicious beast inside you.</b>

09:06.200 --> 09:08.500
<b>That's why I wanted to team up.</b>

09:09.020 --> 09:11.820
<b>There's no limit to what you'll do.</b>

09:14.960 --> 09:17.320
<b>All right... Now, let's get down to business.</b>

09:17.900 --> 09:23.080
<b>But first, could you tell me your name?</b>

09:25.270 --> 09:27.570
<b>I'm Gon... Gon Freecss.</b>

09:28.820 --> 09:31.790
<b>I actually have one more ability.</b>

09:31.790 --> 09:34.520
<b>And the condition for its 
activation has been met.</b>

09:37.960 --> 09:41.220
<b>Time to show you my third power!</b>

09:48.100 --> 09:49.480
<b>Activate!</b>

10:18.660 --> 10:20.240
<b>It isn't flying away...</b>

10:26.440 --> 10:30.650
<b>Does that mean I was using Perfect Plan, too?</b>

10:30.850 --> 10:32.520
<b>Exactly.</b>

10:32.520 --> 10:36.380
<b>This is my third power, God's Accomplice.</b>

10:36.820 --> 10:43.160
<b>While Perfect Plan is active, it allows 
anyone I touch to use it, as well.</b>

10:46.360 --> 10:49.990
<b>Do you understand how powerful 
this technique is now?</b>

10:50.510 --> 10:54.680
<b>This power will let us approach 
and attack the enemy...</b>

10:56.450 --> 10:58.170
<b>without their knowledge.</b>

10:58.680 --> 11:00.830
<b>The King's strength doesn't matter...</b>

11:00.830 --> 11:05.380
<b>If we can sneak up and use a powerful 
attack when his guard is lowered, we'll win.</b>

11:07.960 --> 11:09.370
<b>Hey, Gon...</b>

11:09.940 --> 11:13.020
<b>You're the partner I've been looking for.</b>

11:14.870 --> 11:16.650
<b>The perfect guy to smack the King</b>

11:16.650 --> 11:20.600
<b>with the strongest attack this world's ever seen!</b>

11:27.520 --> 11:29.300
<b>I was watching</b>

11:29.960 --> 11:32.960
<b>when you used that rock-paper-scissors thing.</b>

11:34.020 --> 11:36.130
<b>Those were my soldiers.</b>

11:37.080 --> 11:41.260
<b>I sent them to attack, so I could 
measure your strength,</b>

11:42.490 --> 11:44.320
<b>but they...</b>

11:45.230 --> 11:47.540
<b>Ah, no need to feel bad...</b>

11:47.540 --> 11:51.480
<b>They were killing for sport when 
I wasn't paying attention.</b>

11:51.930 --> 11:55.110
<b>They're no longer my soldiers, or even my allies.</b>

11:55.720 --> 12:00.780
<b>Well, from their perspective, 
I'm the one who's changed.</b>

12:02.590 --> 12:04.390
<b>What you said about being your partner...</b>

12:06.110 --> 12:08.120
<b>There's someone who'd be better than me.</b>

12:09.010 --> 12:10.650
<b>You know someone?</b>

12:11.160 --> 12:11.950
<b>Yep.</b>

12:13.590 --> 12:14.750
<b>I'll contact him.</b>

12:14.750 --> 12:15.770
<b>Hold on.</b>

12:16.870 --> 12:19.360
<b>I trust you.</b>

12:19.360 --> 12:25.150
<b>And even if you end up turning on me, 
I won't blame you or regret my decision.</b>

12:25.150 --> 12:29.950
<b>Because I watched you, spoke to you, 
and decided to trust you.</b>

12:31.060 --> 12:37.610
<b>But I'm not about to trust others 
just because you trust them.</b>

12:37.610 --> 12:39.020
<b>Do you understand?</b>

12:40.300 --> 12:42.160
<b>I get your point, but...</b>

12:42.160 --> 12:45.030
<b>My life is on the line here.</b>

12:47.260 --> 12:48.550
<b>Listen to me.</b>

12:48.550 --> 12:51.820
<b>Perfect Plan is not invincible.</b>

12:51.820 --> 12:53.790
<b>In fact, it's highly vulnerable.</b>

12:53.790 --> 12:56.760
<b>I can make people ignore my existence,</b>

12:56.760 --> 13:01.450
<b>but I'm still right there in the same place.
They just don't notice me.</b>

13:01.450 --> 13:05.800
<b>So their attacks can still hit me.</b>

13:06.300 --> 13:11.680
<b>Knowing there's a person around with 
my ability, what would someone do?</b>

13:12.020 --> 13:15.160
<b>They'd launch attacks in every direction.</b>

13:15.160 --> 13:16.690
<b>Oh, you're right...</b>

13:17.010 --> 13:21.730
<b>If one of those attacks hits me, 
even by dumb luck, I'm done for.</b>

13:21.730 --> 13:23.130
<b>I hate to admit it,</b>

13:23.130 --> 13:26.700
<b>but when it comes to combat, 
I'm the weakest Chimera Ant around.</b>

13:26.700 --> 13:28.710
<b>I'm on the same level as foot soldiers.</b>

13:28.710 --> 13:29.960
<b>Forget the King...</b>

13:29.960 --> 13:33.200
<b>I couldn't even survive a punch 
from a Squadron Leader.</b>

13:33.920 --> 13:37.640
<b>If I just turn invisible, 
others can locate me with <i>En</i>.</b>

13:37.640 --> 13:41.710
<b>It's been tested, so the other 
Squadron Leaders know this, too.</b>

13:42.230 --> 13:46.830
<b>I need my enemies to believe 
my power to be weak.</b>

13:46.830 --> 13:49.640
<b>They need to think <i>En</i> is enough to beat it.</b>

13:50.350 --> 13:56.390
<b>This ability is only invincible 
if no one knows about it.</b>

13:57.800 --> 14:00.000
<b>Enough explaining...</b>

14:00.000 --> 14:04.010
<b>My point is that I don't want to 
reveal my power to any others!</b>

14:04.010 --> 14:07.110
<b>Not even if it's someone you trust.</b>

14:09.280 --> 14:11.230
<b>You can see for yourself, then.</b>

14:13.110 --> 14:16.160
<b>I'll call him out here without mentioning you.</b>

14:16.570 --> 14:17.750
<b>W-Wait...</b>

14:18.180 --> 14:19.990
<b>You can watch from a distance.</b>

14:21.840 --> 14:22.380
<b>Hello—</b>

14:22.380 --> 14:25.350
<b>Yo! I've been waiting, fool!</b>

14:25.350 --> 14:27.770
<b>You pulled a fast one! Where are you?</b>

14:28.860 --> 14:31.250
<b>I've got lots of questions for you.</b>

14:33.000 --> 14:35.750
<b>Because of you kids, the boss 
had to make a move...</b>

14:36.250 --> 14:41.020
<b>The plan's been derailed, 
but I support what you're doing.</b>

14:43.130 --> 14:46.800
<b>Letting five million die isn't right.</b>

14:47.670 --> 14:50.950
<b>The boss used his power to surround the capital.</b>

14:50.950 --> 14:52.170
<b>Really?</b>

14:52.170 --> 14:57.770
<b>That should make it harder for Neferpitou 
to control puppets remotely.</b>

14:57.770 --> 15:02.020
<b>In other words, they can't perform 
the selection from a distance.</b>

15:02.020 --> 15:03.040
<b>Right.</b>

15:03.040 --> 15:09.270
<b>But the boss and Knov-san will be expending 
all their energy to delay Neferpitou.</b>

15:09.270 --> 15:11.850
<b>Which means, when the operation starts,</b>

15:11.850 --> 15:16.640
<b>they won't be in any condition to 
take on any of the Royal Guard.</b>

15:18.880 --> 15:24.210
<b>We expect more citizens to gather 
in the capital for the celebration.</b>

15:24.210 --> 15:27.030
<b>There may be a massacre yet.</b>

15:27.030 --> 15:29.540
<b>The situation's still grim...</b>

15:32.870 --> 15:35.870
<b>We can no longer contact the Chairman.</b>

15:36.200 --> 15:41.250
<b>He's holed up somewhere until the last 
possible minute, preparing for the final battle.</b>

15:48.230 --> 15:50.600
<b>We four need to make a decision.</b>

15:51.210 --> 15:56.140
<b>Do we summon reinforcements, or do we 
face the three Royal Guards by ourselves?</b>

15:58.610 --> 16:00.460
<b>I'd like to know Killua's opinion.</b>

16:01.070 --> 16:02.470
<b>He isn't here.</b>

16:03.020 --> 16:05.040
<b>What? You split up?</b>

16:06.050 --> 16:09.440
<b>I get it... He's been disrupting things alone.</b>

16:09.440 --> 16:11.150
<b>Can you call him real quick?</b>

16:16.050 --> 16:18.150
<b>No luck. He isn't picking up...</b>

16:18.150 --> 16:19.290
<b>I think his is off.</b>

16:19.640 --> 16:22.920
<b>Really? Well, keep trying.</b>

16:23.340 --> 16:26.710
<b>We should meet up, the sooner the better.</b>

16:26.710 --> 16:27.570
<b>Yeah.</b>

16:27.570 --> 16:31.690
<b>Let's find a halfway point to meet.</b>

16:33.210 --> 16:35.360
<b>Here... Mandai City.</b>

16:35.680 --> 16:37.470
<b>Okay, got it.</b>

16:55.510 --> 16:56.320
<b>Checkmate.</b>

16:58.390 --> 16:59.390
<b>You're done.</b>

17:04.640 --> 17:07.080
<b>Why didn't you resign?</b>

17:14.190 --> 17:15.850
<b>Don't make me repeat myself.</b>

17:15.850 --> 17:20.350
<b>The match ended twenty-two moves ago.</b>

17:20.720 --> 17:23.100
<b>Why did you not resign then?</b>

17:23.700 --> 17:26.480
<b>Did you believe I would make a mistake?</b>

17:42.600 --> 17:43.890
<b>Idiot.</b>

17:46.180 --> 17:48.730
<b>Next, we have the national Go champion.</b>

17:50.100 --> 17:51.550
<b>Give me the rulebook.</b>

17:54.530 --> 17:58.300
<b>It may look simple at first, 
but it is a complex game.</b>

17:59.140 --> 18:01.660
<b>It may take more time to learn than shogi.</b>

18:15.360 --> 18:17.470
<b>Please let me leave!</b>

18:17.470 --> 18:18.700
<b>What do you want?</b>

18:19.430 --> 18:22.470
<b>Someone! Help me!</b>

18:25.820 --> 18:26.900
<b>My glasses...</b>

18:26.900 --> 18:27.990
<b>Silence.</b>

18:29.080 --> 18:30.620
<b>You are in the King's presence.</b>

18:38.620 --> 18:40.180
<b>The choice is yours.</b>

18:41.710 --> 18:44.430
<b>Sit across from me now.</b>

18:45.490 --> 18:46.680
<b>Or die.</b>

18:53.820 --> 18:55.390
<b>5.5 points.</b>

18:55.390 --> 18:56.820
<b>The King wins.</b>

18:57.700 --> 18:59.540
<b><i>I-It only took him ten games?</i></b>

19:00.930 --> 19:03.000
<b>I'm t-tired!</b>

19:03.000 --> 19:04.680
<b>It's the only explanation for that loss!</b>

19:04.680 --> 19:06.540
<b>And I think I have a fever.</b>

19:06.540 --> 19:07.480
<b>I'm short on sleep.</b>

19:07.480 --> 19:08.460
<b>And I feel dizzy...</b>

19:09.580 --> 19:10.620
<b>I'll give you eight hours.</b>

19:11.270 --> 19:12.420
<b>And any medicine you need.</b>

19:13.010 --> 19:14.930
<b>I expect you to be in top condition.</b>

19:16.140 --> 19:19.250
<b>Should you lose again, I won't 
be interested in excuses.</b>

19:20.500 --> 19:22.140
<b>Rest as if your life depends on it.</b>

19:27.550 --> 19:31.950
<b>I'm impressed by how quickly 
you learn these games.</b>

19:32.680 --> 19:36.540
<b>I can't believe it took less than half 
the time you spent mastering shogi.</b>

19:37.020 --> 19:39.260
<b>It's all about learning the feel.</b>

19:40.120 --> 19:43.200
<b>Chess, Go, shogi...</b>

19:43.760 --> 19:46.650
<b>They have different rules, but all three</b>

19:46.650 --> 19:49.620
<b>have a certain rhythm to their moves.</b>

19:50.840 --> 19:54.170
<b>That means disrupting your 
opponent's rhythm is crucial.</b>

19:54.780 --> 19:58.630
<b>Once you've learned the openings, 
you can deduce your opponent's rhythm.</b>

20:00.510 --> 20:04.390
<b>Once you know their rhythm, 
you need only disrupt it.</b>

20:05.450 --> 20:08.890
<b>A psychological principle that 
would apply to any contest.</b>

20:09.500 --> 20:14.220
<b>If you've already reached that conclusion, 
I don't see the benefit of playing more games.</b>

20:15.030 --> 20:17.600
<b>I believe they will only bore you.</b>

20:19.090 --> 20:20.950
<b>How many remain?</b>

20:21.550 --> 20:25.110
<b>This country has one more professional game.</b>

20:25.430 --> 20:27.700
<b>It's a board game called Gungi.</b>

20:28.790 --> 20:29.870
<b>Gungi?</b>

20:30.360 --> 20:32.990
<b>The game originated in East Gorteau,</b>

20:32.990 --> 20:36.130
<b>and nearly all citizens know how to play.</b>

20:36.400 --> 20:38.050
<b>Give me the rulebook.</b>

20:41.900 --> 20:45.900
<b>As in chess and shogi, its goal is to trap the king.</b>

20:46.500 --> 20:49.430
<b>But you can stack up to three pieces.</b>

20:49.430 --> 20:53.770
<b>At the start, you may also freely place 
your pieces within your own area.</b>

20:54.330 --> 20:57.080
<b>The game has a different feel</b>

20:57.080 --> 21:00.780
<b>due to the addition of a third dimension.</b>

21:01.770 --> 21:05.810
<b>For the past fifteen years, 
there have been world tournaments,</b>

21:05.810 --> 21:08.630
<b>and East Gorteau has yet to lose.</b>

21:09.630 --> 21:13.790
<b>Currently, they're on their third representative, 
a five-time reigning champion.</b>

21:15.720 --> 21:19.040
<b>Then, if I defeat this champion, 
I'll be the best in the world?</b>

21:19.690 --> 21:22.140
<b>A fitting way to end this recreation.</b>

21:23.000 --> 21:24.020
<b>Bring them in.</b>

21:46.270 --> 21:48.560
<b>There are six days until the selection.</b>

21:49.070 --> 21:52.580
<b>The King has no idea</b>

21:52.580 --> 21:57.580
<b>how this girl is about to influence his fate.</b>

23:24.770 --> 23:26.960
<b>Next time: Check x And x Mate.</b>

23:26.960 --> 23:27.940
<b>I'm Gon.</b>

23:27.940 --> 23:29.000
<b>I'm Gillua.</b>

23:29.000 --> 23:30.290
<b>Did you change your name?</b>

23:30.290 --> 23:31.370
<b>No way.</b>

23:31.370 --> 23:32.340
<b>Say it again.</b>

23:32.340 --> 23:33.720
<b>I'm Gillua!</b>

23:33.720 --> 23:34.430
<b>GG!</b>
