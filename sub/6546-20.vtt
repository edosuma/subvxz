00:01.169 --> 00:02.249
(Audrey): Previously on Haven...

00:02.712 --> 00:05.454
- Hi, excuse me.
Stuart Mosley?

00:05.590 --> 00:07.000
(Stuart): Oh, my God.

00:07.758 --> 00:09.749
(Audrey): He sent Duke and Nathan
back in time.

00:09.886 --> 00:11.592
Stuart, this is you.

00:11.721 --> 00:14.212
These two men need your help
to get home.

00:16.058 --> 00:18.765
- 30 years ago,
the day I woke up on the beach,

00:18.895 --> 00:22.638
lying beside me
was The Colorado Kid, dead.

00:22.773 --> 00:23.979
Did I kill Audrey's son?

00:24.108 --> 00:25.723
- No, I won't believe it.

00:25.860 --> 00:28.977
- Duke? l'm Hailie Colton.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.359
I did it!

00:32.491 --> 00:34.356
(man): So you like to watch, Dave?

00:34.493 --> 00:36.870
(Dave): | see what Croatoan's doing,

00:36.996 --> 00:39.658
and he knows I'm watching.
I have to do this, Vince.

00:39.790 --> 00:41.326
- Then I'm coming with you.

00:41.459 --> 00:42.949
Oh, my.

00:45.296 --> 00:47.537
- How?
- Why did he put it here?

00:47.673 --> 00:50.415
- Because Croatoan didn't,
Dave did.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.667
Dave killed Charlotte.

00:58.351 --> 01:01.388
- I need some answers
about Charlotte's death, Dave.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.853
- Nathan, please understand.

01:04.982 --> 01:06.188
It wasn't me.

01:06.651 --> 01:08.687
l was being controlled
by Croatoan.

01:08.819 --> 01:11.401
- But why would Croatoan
want Charlotte dead?

01:11.530 --> 01:14.488
- I swear,
I don't remember anything.

01:15.326 --> 01:16.862
It was just like last time.

01:16.994 --> 01:18.905
- What, something like this
happened before?

01:20.081 --> 01:21.662
- 1983.

01:22.083 --> 01:24.574
Woke up on the beach once
near a body.

01:25.836 --> 01:26.916
- Whose body?

01:27.922 --> 01:30.789
- James Cogan,
The Colorado Kid.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.335
Your son.

01:33.511 --> 01:35.547
I think
I killed him too, Nathan.

01:35.680 --> 01:37.887
(crying)

01:38.015 --> 01:39.346
I'm so sorry.

01:40.351 --> 01:42.717
- I need to know everything
that you remember

01:42.853 --> 01:44.104
about the day he died.

01:44.230 --> 01:46.596
- I don't remember much
about that day.

01:48.526 --> 01:50.391
(sighs)

01:50.528 --> 01:51.734
It's all so jumbled.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.695
- Who was there?
Anyone suspicious?

01:55.700 --> 01:57.190
- There was one stranger,

01:57.785 --> 01:59.867
a woman, just for a minute.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.828
She ran past me
just as the thinny opened

02:02.957 --> 02:04.163
and l was drawn in.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.248
- Wait, wait, wait.

02:07.086 --> 02:09.953
You saw a thinny
on the beach? Are you sure?

02:10.631 --> 02:13.498
- Yeah, the only thing I'm sure of.
- Who was this woman?

02:13.634 --> 02:15.170
Why was she there?

02:15.303 --> 02:16.713
- I don't know.

02:22.977 --> 02:26.265
- There's another way
into the Void.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.313
(Nathan): This is where Dave
said he saw the open thinny.

02:37.450 --> 02:40.533
- But Charlotte sealed
the Thinnies 500 years ago.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.526
- Maybe.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.119
Dave saw one.

02:44.248 --> 02:46.330
We need to find it.

02:46.459 --> 02:50.452
We have to get
into the Void, Parker.

02:50.588 --> 02:53.546
- Charlotte said that we needed
to get, um...

02:53.674 --> 02:56.131
- She called it a controller.

02:56.260 --> 02:59.127
Said it's the other piece
we need besides the aether core

02:59.263 --> 03:01.128
to build a new Barn.

03:01.265 --> 03:04.678
- Okay, well, let's say that
somehow we are able to get it.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.392
Do you really think that
we're gonna be able to build

03:07.521 --> 03:11.184
a-a new Barn without...

03:13.527 --> 03:16.644
My mother?
- We have to.

03:16.781 --> 03:19.147
Charlotte said that the new Barn
would remove the Troubles

03:19.283 --> 03:22.821
and everything else that belonged
in the Void, including Croatoan.

03:22.953 --> 03:26.081
- He won't be able
to influence Dave anymore.

03:26.207 --> 03:29.825
Nathan, I don't think
that there's a thinny here.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.575
I would see a shimmer.

03:31.712 --> 03:35.375
I would feel something.

03:35.508 --> 03:38.341
- So what,
it just disappeared?

03:38.469 --> 03:39.959
None of the others have.

03:40.805 --> 03:42.841
Unless it was caused
by a Trouble.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.518
Dave knew everyone
except that woman at the beach.

03:47.311 --> 03:49.347
She's our
unknown element here.

03:50.648 --> 03:52.013
We have to find her.

03:52.149 --> 03:53.855
- Well, where are we gonna find
a mystery woman

03:53.984 --> 03:55.690
from almost 30 years ago?

03:57.863 --> 03:59.148
- Right here...

04:00.324 --> 04:01.484
where we know she was.

04:01.867 --> 04:04.859
- What?
She was here in 1983.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.576
- Exactly.

04:08.374 --> 04:09.910
I'm going back in time.

04:12.336 --> 04:15.248
(somber folk music)

04:43.701 --> 04:45.692
(Vince):
As requested, my sketch.

04:46.745 --> 04:48.076
- The woman Dave saw
on the beach?

04:48.205 --> 04:51.163
- Yes. I know I've seen her before,
but it was years ago.

04:51.292 --> 04:54.750
I don't think she's still in Haven.
- Yeah, but she was in 1983.

04:54.879 --> 04:57.996
I had Audrey
bring Stuart Mosley in.

04:58.132 --> 05:00.794
- You're gonna use Mosley's
Trouble to go back in time?

05:01.218 --> 05:03.083
- To the day the Colorado Kid died,

05:04.096 --> 05:06.303
the day Dave saw this woman
on the beach.

05:06.432 --> 05:09.094
- l was laid up
in East Shore Hospital that day.

05:09.226 --> 05:10.932
But why is the woman
so important?

05:11.061 --> 05:13.973
- The thinny Dave saw on the beach
that day... it was open.

05:14.106 --> 05:15.516
Now it's gone.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.106
This woman may be the only
person who can tell me why.

05:23.908 --> 05:24.863
- Nice outfit.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.608
I guess nylon was in in '83.

05:27.745 --> 05:29.110
- We raided Goodwill.

05:29.747 --> 05:31.032
What do you think?

05:31.165 --> 05:33.281
- Kind of glad I'm immune
to Mosley's Troubles

05:33.417 --> 05:35.453
so I don't have
to go back with you.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.122
He's in the break room.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.165
- How are you gonna switch on
Mosley's Trouble?

05:39.298 --> 05:41.505
- Oh, he gets upset
every time he sees me.

05:41.634 --> 05:44.000
I think it's because I keep
crossing through his time line.

05:44.136 --> 05:46.513
Anyway,
his Trouble activates.

05:46.639 --> 05:51.133
- When it's time to come home,
show 1983 Mosley this photo.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.475
It's the same photo we used before.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.103
- Thanks.

05:58.108 --> 06:01.896
- Look, I should come with you.
I can help. I know 1983.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.644
You were just a boy then.

06:03.781 --> 06:06.523
- Okay. Good.

06:07.451 --> 06:09.612
You'll need some clothes
from that time period.

06:14.959 --> 06:17.325
- This is what I wore back then.

06:17.461 --> 06:18.541
- Of course it is.

06:20.631 --> 06:22.167
- Keep your interactions small.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.550
Be like mice.

06:23.676 --> 06:27.260
If you change anything in the past,
it can make things worse now.

06:27.388 --> 06:30.175
All you need to figure out is
what that woman knows about the thinny.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.763
- Absolutely.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.803
- Okay.
Hey...

06:36.355 --> 06:37.470
This might help.

06:42.820 --> 06:43.980
- Thanks.

06:47.658 --> 06:51.276
- Remember, you can't change
what happens.

06:51.412 --> 06:52.868
- I know.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.072
You ready?

07:04.675 --> 07:06.711
No, that's A.M.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.382
You know what? Never mind.
I can do it myself.

07:11.515 --> 07:12.880
(phone beeps)

07:13.017 --> 07:16.555
(scoffs)

07:16.687 --> 07:18.678
(sighs)

07:25.112 --> 07:27.945
Okay, fellas, you know what?
You could have just knocked.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.654
- Clear!

07:29.783 --> 07:31.284
- Or not.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.781
Look, if this is about
a certain bank

07:35.581 --> 07:39.870
and a certain $31,000... ish,

07:40.210 --> 07:41.416
I don't have it.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.246
I said, "I don't have it."

07:45.382 --> 07:46.633
- Skip McMannis, huh?

07:47.134 --> 07:51.002
You need new |Ds, Mr. Crocker.
You've been using that one since 2007.

07:51.138 --> 07:54.471
- You guys have been keeping tabs
on me since 2007?

07:56.560 --> 07:59.051
If the shroud is still up,
you shouldn't even remember me.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.774
Hey. Hey!

08:02.900 --> 08:04.231
Who the hell are you guys?

08:05.069 --> 08:08.812
(Nathan): l have to surprise him, Vince,
so you go in first.

08:13.494 --> 08:14.859
- Who the hell are you?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.826
- You don't ask the questions here.

08:17.414 --> 08:18.745
Remember this?

08:21.335 --> 08:22.871
- It's from the paper.

08:23.003 --> 08:26.211
- I know that.
Do you remember this day, Mr. Mosley?

08:26.340 --> 08:28.251
The day they found the Colorado Kid?

08:30.427 --> 08:31.758
- l was here.

08:32.096 --> 08:35.213
I spent the entire day
in this damn police station,

08:35.349 --> 08:37.965
ﬁghﬂng
about parking tickets.

08:38.102 --> 08:39.262
- Hello, Mr. Mosley.

08:41.105 --> 08:43.016
- You!

08:44.441 --> 08:46.853
- Whoa, how'd you do that?

08:48.612 --> 08:51.149
(camera shutter clicks,
camera whirs)

09:04.336 --> 09:05.872
Where did you come from?

09:10.801 --> 09:13.417
- We're from the government.
(Vince): Yeah.

09:13.554 --> 09:14.794
- And we need that photo.

09:18.142 --> 09:19.803
Your country thanks you.

09:21.311 --> 09:25.145
Now, uh, is
Detective Wuornos around?

09:27.317 --> 09:29.478
('80s pop rock music)

09:36.535 --> 09:38.947
May 22, 1983.
It's the right day.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.912
(Stuart): Damn it! I don't
even own this car anymore.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.372
And they ain't my tickets.
- That's young Mosley.

09:44.501 --> 09:47.493
(Nathan): That's our way home.
(Stuart): Are you even hearing me?

09:48.422 --> 09:50.629
- Okay.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.750
So we know Dave is gonna wind up
near that thinny.

09:53.886 --> 09:55.342
So I'll go and find him.

09:55.679 --> 09:59.012
- Okay, but keep your distance,
no interacting.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.928
I'll find the woman
in the sketch.

10:02.060 --> 10:05.723
With any luck, we'll meet up on that beach.
- Okay.

10:05.856 --> 10:09.223
(indistinct chatter)

10:15.407 --> 10:18.114
- | just want to make sure
you're okay.

10:21.205 --> 10:22.445
(speaking indistinctly)

10:22.581 --> 10:24.321
Yeah.

10:24.458 --> 10:25.789
-Oh, um...

10:28.796 --> 10:31.583
(coughs)

10:31.715 --> 10:34.457
Uh...

10:34.593 --> 10:35.753
- Yes?

10:36.428 --> 10:38.589
-Are you...

10:41.767 --> 10:42.973
Detective Wuornos?

10:43.101 --> 10:45.353
- Sure am.
Can I help you?

10:45.479 --> 10:48.971
- Yeah.
I'm looking for this woman.

10:50.651 --> 10:53.313
(Garland): Super.
Who the hell are you?

10:53.445 --> 10:56.778
- Special Agent
Nathan Butterworth, FBI.

10:56.907 --> 11:00.616
- Okay. Give me a minute
to see my lady friend out.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.200
I'll be right back.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.910
Get you a coffee?

11:04.581 --> 11:07.618
- Black. Yeah, thanks.
- Sure.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.832
- I recognize that woman
in his sketch.

11:13.674 --> 11:14.789
lt's Barbara Colton.

11:14.925 --> 11:16.085
She's Troubled.

11:16.969 --> 11:18.880
- So why do the Feds
want her?

11:19.012 --> 11:20.843
We don't need that kind
of attention.

11:20.973 --> 11:22.759
- Especially today.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.387
| just want to call James
and say good-bye

11:26.520 --> 11:28.681
and make sure
he gets out of town

11:29.940 --> 11:32.147
before I go back
into the Barn.

11:32.693 --> 11:36.811
- See James.
I'll get rid of this joker.

11:42.119 --> 11:44.656
(Duke):
Okay, so you guys know about me.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.154
How about a little town
called Haven?

11:47.291 --> 11:48.656
Haven, Maine?

11:48.792 --> 11:51.124
Anybody?
Ring a bell?

11:53.297 --> 11:55.754
Whatever.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.464
You're wasting your time.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.626
False arrest,
illegal search.

12:01.722 --> 12:05.055
This'll never hold up in court.
- We're not from the government.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.174
There's no court...

12:08.145 --> 12:09.134
just us.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.182
- Okay.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.731
Help!
Anybod...

12:25.579 --> 12:27.490
- There you go.
Black as sin.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.199
- Thank you, Detective.

12:32.336 --> 12:34.167
- Call me Garland, Nathan.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.207
I got a boy named Nathan.

12:36.340 --> 12:37.921
- Oh, yeah? Good kid?

12:39.009 --> 12:40.499
- Ah, sometimes.

12:41.345 --> 12:44.087
He's always putting his butt
on my desk, like you.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.757
- Maybe he likes sitting up there
so he can be closer to his dad.

12:48.894 --> 12:52.682
- Ah, I don't know, maybe.
So this woman, what'd she do?

12:55.067 --> 12:56.682
- Uh, that's, um...

12:57.110 --> 12:58.566
lt's confidential,

12:59.112 --> 13:00.318
FBl business.

13:00.447 --> 13:05.362
But I hope that the Bureau
can still depend on your help, Garland.

13:05.786 --> 13:08.698
- I'll put every available man
that I can on it.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.700
But I have no idea
who this person is.

13:13.085 --> 13:15.201
- Don't you have a local paper?

13:16.046 --> 13:17.377
Maybe they can help.

13:17.756 --> 13:19.747
- The Herald’s closed.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.628
One of the publishers is
in the hospital.

13:22.761 --> 13:24.922
- Yeah, uh, Vince Teagues.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.763
Is he at County
or out at the Ping?

13:31.395 --> 13:32.555
- County.

13:33.063 --> 13:34.974
I'll tell you what,
Agent Butterworth,

13:35.107 --> 13:37.723
before you go bothering
those boys,

13:39.569 --> 13:41.901
I'm just gonna check on one thing.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.199
- Hey, mister.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.288
I know you're not a cop
around here,

13:54.418 --> 13:57.876
but they're always too busy
to help me, anyways. So maybe you can.

13:58.255 --> 13:59.461
- Yeah. What's wrong?

13:59.589 --> 14:02.171
- My camera got stolen,
my good one.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.585
- Did you file a report?

14:03.719 --> 14:05.255
- I already know who stole it...

14:05.595 --> 14:07.927
A kid in my grade, Duke Crocker.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.392
- Come here.

14:14.896 --> 14:17.558
You know that abandoned shed
out on East Beach?

14:19.943 --> 14:22.980
(whispering): That's where Duke
hides all the things he steals.

14:23.113 --> 14:24.978
Go get your camera back.

14:25.574 --> 14:26.734
- How do you know that?

14:27.284 --> 14:29.445
(normal voice): Told you,
| work for the government.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.448
Get out of here.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.868
- Yes, I'm sure, James.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.992
l have to leave for a while.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.413
- If you say so.

14:39.546 --> 14:40.661
ljust...

14:41.131 --> 14:42.746
I wish we had more time
together.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.460
- Me too.

14:46.928 --> 14:49.510
Can we go for one last walk
on the beach?

14:50.307 --> 14:53.174
- Yeah, I'll meet you at 4:00. Okay?

14:53.643 --> 14:54.974
I love you, Mom.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.146
- I love you too.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.152
- We have a problem.

15:07.365 --> 15:09.856
That FBI agent just referred
to East Shore Hospital

15:09.993 --> 15:11.153
as "the Ping."

15:11.661 --> 15:13.526
- Only Haven cops call it the Ping.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.654
- Yeah. Something's not right here.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.324
I'm gonna make some calls
and check him out.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.538
You got a minute
to stall him for me?

15:20.670 --> 15:22.001
- Sure.

15:32.516 --> 15:34.052
(Vince): Excuse me.

15:34.184 --> 15:37.847
I'm looking for a David J. Teagues.

15:38.522 --> 15:42.265
- l'm Dave.
- Well, pleasure to meet you.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.732
Wallace Telman, literary agent.

15:44.861 --> 15:47.773
You wrote a piece
on the vanishing lobster man

15:47.906 --> 15:49.942
of Spruce Island that was, well...

15:50.075 --> 15:51.736
sublime.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.076
- Well, lots of lobstering
going on around here.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.786
Write what you know.

15:56.915 --> 16:01.158
- Indeed. And if I may be so bold,
I think you should get to know

16:01.545 --> 16:04.878
the dude ranches in New Mexico
immediately.

16:05.257 --> 16:08.420
- Excuse me?
- Mr. Teagues, I'll be blunt.

16:08.552 --> 16:11.635
You're a wonderful writer...
Muscular, nuanced...

16:11.763 --> 16:15.722
And I could get you published
in Time magazine

16:15.851 --> 16:19.093
if you covered
an inter-dude-ranch rodeo

16:19.229 --> 16:22.062
in New Mexico tomorrow.

16:22.732 --> 16:25.109
- Tomorrow?
- You'd have to leave tonight.

16:25.235 --> 16:26.725
- Wow.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.065
Wait a minute.

16:32.284 --> 16:34.775
Oh, my God.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.068
Vincent?

16:37.747 --> 16:40.580
(sighs)

16:40.709 --> 16:42.745
- Oh, darn it all!

17:01.897 --> 17:03.307
- Barbara Colton.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.305
And there's your address.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.943
(clears throat)

17:15.785 --> 17:17.446
Hi.

17:18.622 --> 17:20.613
- Find anything interesting?

17:21.082 --> 17:24.040
- Uh... just looking for a pen.

17:24.169 --> 17:26.831
- Oh.
Well, here...

17:27.839 --> 17:29.670
use... use mine.

17:30.717 --> 17:31.877
I'm Lucy.

17:33.178 --> 17:34.884
- Nathan.

17:41.186 --> 17:44.678
Thanks.
- What just happened?

17:44.814 --> 17:46.850
- Nothing.

17:49.194 --> 17:50.354
I should go.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.610
-Wait. Um...

17:55.742 --> 17:58.654
Garland sent me in here to help you.

17:58.787 --> 18:01.950
Maybe I know this woman
that you're looking for.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.412
- |-|-|, um...

18:08.380 --> 18:10.041
I have everything I need.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.039
I should really go.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.053
- Um, my pen.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.316
- It was nice to meet you.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.252
- Okay.

18:51.381 --> 18:54.498
(phone beeping, line trilling)

18:54.634 --> 18:56.295
- Hi, it’s Barbara.
Leave a message.

18:56.428 --> 18:57.383
(answering machine beeps)

18:57.512 --> 19:00.800
- Barbara. It's me, Lucy.

19:01.516 --> 19:03.598
You need to get out of town...

19:04.519 --> 19:05.554
HOW.

19:20.618 --> 19:22.119
- Barbara Colton?

19:25.373 --> 19:28.536
I need to talk to you.
- Now's not really a good time.

19:30.295 --> 19:31.501
That ring...

19:32.464 --> 19:33.670
where'd you get it?

19:34.507 --> 19:36.293
Wa...

19:46.770 --> 19:48.476
Barbara, wait!

19:48.605 --> 19:50.311
- Hands where I can
see them now!

19:51.858 --> 19:54.065
- That woman... you have
to let me go after her.

19:54.194 --> 19:57.686
- Don't think so. There is no
Nathan Butterworth at the FBI.

19:57.822 --> 20:00.404
- Garland, I need to talk
to Barbara Colton.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.239
I think she can do something.

20:02.369 --> 20:05.486
- No, you're not going anywhere
until you tell me who the hell you are.

20:05.830 --> 20:09.072
- Okay, I know it sounds like I am talking
nonsense, but I am on your side.

20:09.209 --> 20:12.076
I am trying to save Haven.

20:12.212 --> 20:15.124
- "Save Haven"?
What's your interest in this?

20:15.256 --> 20:17.918
You're not with the FBI.
You're not with the State Police.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.791
I can't find a record
on you anywhere.

20:20.470 --> 20:23.462
Why don't we just start with you
telling me your real name?

20:25.725 --> 20:28.387
- My first name really is Nathan.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.431
I was born here at the Ping,

20:30.563 --> 20:32.269
12:43 A.M.,

20:32.399 --> 20:34.435
December 14th,

20:34.567 --> 20:38.685
to Elizabeth and Max Hansen.

20:39.614 --> 20:41.730
But I took my adoptive father's
last name.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.319
I'm Nathan Wuornos.

20:45.620 --> 20:46.951
I'm your son.

20:53.586 --> 20:57.875
- So I'm supposed to believe
that you're my son come back in time?

20:58.758 --> 21:01.500
- You know better than anyone
what Troubles can do.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.585
- Don't move.

21:04.889 --> 21:08.598
So whose Trouble was it, then,
sent you back from the future?

21:08.726 --> 21:10.717
- Stuart Mosley. You know him?

21:11.062 --> 21:12.268
- Know the family.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.221
Then again, so does anyone
with a phone book.

21:20.738 --> 21:22.444
- Did I pass the test?

21:28.955 --> 21:30.240
- I just pricked you.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.075
- Do I need a Band-Aid?

21:33.001 --> 21:34.832
- Didn't seem like
you even felt it.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.628
- Didn't.
- But you knew I was gonna do it.

21:39.048 --> 21:40.709
- 'Cause I know you.

21:42.469 --> 21:43.675
You're my father.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.221
It's a lotto take in, Chief.

21:48.349 --> 21:52.137
- So I made Chief, huh?
- Yeah.

21:54.272 --> 21:57.810
- I'm sure glad you finally
grew into those ears, son.

22:00.653 --> 22:04.521
(Dave):
Oh, what... what about flying cars?

22:04.657 --> 22:06.693
Did the Commies get them first?

22:07.118 --> 22:11.532
- Yes, they had whole fleets of them,
armed with death rays.

22:11.664 --> 22:16.829
Dave, I didn't come here to reveal
the secrets of the future to you.

22:16.961 --> 22:18.371
- Then why did you come here?

22:18.505 --> 22:20.837
- To tell you that you're going
to be in terrible danger.

22:20.965 --> 22:22.421
You need to leave Haven.

22:22.550 --> 22:26.088
- Hello, you just revealed
secrets of the future to me.

22:26.221 --> 22:27.506
- I'm being serious, Dave.

22:28.264 --> 22:29.470
You have to get packed.

22:29.974 --> 22:31.305
There's no time to waste.

22:31.434 --> 22:34.892
- Hold on there, Buck Rogers.
Yeah, l-l'm not going anywhere

22:35.021 --> 22:39.685
until you tell me what's going on.
And no more being vague.

22:40.610 --> 22:41.645
I want details.

22:41.778 --> 22:43.314
- Fine.

22:43.905 --> 22:45.691
I'm not supposed to be telling you this

22:46.157 --> 22:49.240
but later today you are going
to be possessed

22:49.369 --> 22:53.282
by Croatoan, a monster
from another dimension.

22:53.414 --> 22:56.656
I'm here to stop that,
because if it happens,

22:57.001 --> 22:58.741
your fate will be sealed.

22:59.504 --> 23:02.541
- That was probably
a little too much detail.

23:10.181 --> 23:11.557
Well, I guess I'd better pack.

23:17.480 --> 23:21.723
(helicopter blades
whirring overhead)

23:21.859 --> 23:23.474
(man): He's here.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.020
Go help.

23:27.156 --> 23:28.441
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

23:37.709 --> 23:39.916
- Hey, I got an idea.

23:40.837 --> 23:44.625
You can just let me slip out
that bathroom window,

23:45.341 --> 23:48.458
say I-I sucker-punched you,
all right?

23:48.845 --> 23:50.085
And in return,

23:50.221 --> 23:51.802
I can set you up with a life

23:51.931 --> 23:54.217
where you never have
to wear a suit again.

23:54.601 --> 23:56.011
You know what I'm saying?

23:57.645 --> 23:58.851
- I like suits.

24:02.692 --> 24:05.479
- Whoo!
Duke Crocker...

24:06.070 --> 24:07.446
I've been looking for you.

24:14.912 --> 24:17.289
(Garland): And you think that
Barbara Colton's Trouble

24:17.415 --> 24:19.497
has something to do
with making these Thinnies.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.617
- I saw her vanish
from right in front of me

24:21.753 --> 24:23.960
and then appear over there
a second later.

24:24.088 --> 24:26.295
- Barbara robbed a jewelry store
last year.

24:26.424 --> 24:29.291
The door was alarmed,
but she came right through the wall.

24:29.427 --> 24:31.918
I didn't know that she could
move through thin air, though.

24:32.055 --> 24:33.090
- Maybe it's something new.

24:33.222 --> 24:35.838
Something's changing the way
her Trouble works.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.387
I saw her wearing a ring...

24:40.104 --> 24:41.719
like this.

24:43.232 --> 24:46.975
- Lucy has that ring.
Barbara must have stolen it.

24:47.111 --> 24:49.727
- These rings allow people
to travel between dimensions.

24:50.323 --> 24:53.030
I think when Barbara wears it,
it alters her Trouble

24:53.159 --> 24:55.024
so that she's not just
passing through things,

24:55.161 --> 24:57.368
she's passing in and out
of the Void,

24:57.872 --> 25:01.410
creating temporary Thinnies.
We need one of those Thinnies.

25:01.542 --> 25:05.205
Finding a way into the Void,
that's our only hope now.

25:06.464 --> 25:08.921
- So it's that bad, then...
Haven in the future?

25:09.342 --> 25:11.378
- Yeah, it's worse
than it's ever been.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.512
- I might have an answer.

25:13.638 --> 25:15.048
There's a man named Howard.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.922
- I know him in my time too.

25:18.267 --> 25:19.803
- He said something to me
the other day,

25:20.186 --> 25:23.974
something that could save Haven
right now.

25:24.440 --> 25:28.024
He said that the Troubles
would go away forever...

25:29.696 --> 25:32.062
If Lucy killed the one
thatsheloved.

25:32.198 --> 25:35.986
- And the one that she loves is you.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.951
- Maybe I was once.

25:40.998 --> 25:42.078
But it's her son.

25:42.667 --> 25:44.407
Ever since she found James,

25:44.836 --> 25:46.918
there's room
for no one else.

25:47.797 --> 25:49.253
- Have you told Lucy
about this?

25:49.382 --> 25:51.964
- No, of course not.
I could never do that.

25:52.301 --> 25:54.383
All the suffering
that she could end,

25:54.721 --> 25:56.882
all the lives
that she could save,

25:57.265 --> 25:59.096
but she'd have to kill
her own son.

25:59.225 --> 26:02.012
What kind of a choice is that
for a parent to make?

26:03.104 --> 26:05.186
- Audrey refused
to make that choice.

26:05.732 --> 26:06.721
- Audrey?

26:07.442 --> 26:09.649
- Lucy in the future.

26:11.821 --> 26:14.483
- So what about you and me?
How are we in the future?

26:14.824 --> 26:16.735
- We have some rough times.

26:17.994 --> 26:19.655
You never gave me a break...

26:21.873 --> 26:22.862
Not once.

26:23.458 --> 26:24.413
- That right, huh?

26:24.542 --> 26:25.873
- Mm-hmm.

26:33.259 --> 26:36.751
- You were trying to get me ready
to do the job you'd been doing.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.756
When the Troubles came back,
I didn't think I was ready,

26:41.893 --> 26:43.554
but it turns out that I was...

26:46.022 --> 26:47.432
Because of you.

26:49.066 --> 26:52.103
I never gave you credit
for that.

26:52.236 --> 26:55.353
- Well, I guess you just did.
And that's real sweet,

26:56.282 --> 26:57.897
but we're kind of busy right now.

27:01.287 --> 27:03.778
(car engine whirring)

27:04.290 --> 27:06.076
- That's Lucy.
Where's she going?

27:06.918 --> 27:08.033
- Why would she be leaving?

27:08.461 --> 27:09.871
What if she heard

27:10.004 --> 27:12.290
what we were saying
about what Howard told you?

27:12.632 --> 27:14.668
- Well, that's not the way
I'd want to hear it either.

27:14.801 --> 27:17.668
- No, no. You don't understand.
Howard didn't tell you everything.

27:17.804 --> 27:19.886
The Troubles end if Lucy kills
the one she loves

27:20.014 --> 27:22.551
because Troubled people
everywhere,

27:23.059 --> 27:24.799
every one of them dies.

27:24.936 --> 27:27.723
- Wait. That means
if she kills James...

27:27.855 --> 27:30.938
- Then a whole lot of people
are gonna die today, including us.

27:31.067 --> 27:33.023
- Let's go.

27:40.368 --> 27:41.778
- I have to stop Lucy.

27:42.203 --> 27:43.989
Can you bird-dog
the Colton woman?

27:44.121 --> 27:45.622
- On it. You need a car?

27:47.166 --> 27:48.372
(Nathan): I already got one.

27:48.501 --> 27:50.207
- That's Lyman Grood's Bronco.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.291
- Not forever.

27:51.754 --> 27:53.619
I know how to hot-wire it.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.789
- Damn, I did an outstanding job
of training you.

28:03.432 --> 28:07.641
- But why did you pick that story
to get me to leave?

28:07.770 --> 28:11.103
You really think
I could make it as a writer?

28:11.232 --> 28:14.224
- I know you can, Dave.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.602
- I do have a muscular style.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.729
- Hmm, yeah.
Well, just keep packing.

28:22.076 --> 28:23.816
(Vince): That's Lucy.

28:28.124 --> 28:30.365
- Right, she... she can't know about you.

28:30.501 --> 28:31.786
Just stay here.

28:37.508 --> 28:39.920
Lucy?

28:40.052 --> 28:41.167
You all right?

28:41.304 --> 28:43.295
- No.

28:44.473 --> 28:46.634
What would you sacrifice
to save this town,

28:47.476 --> 28:48.636
to stop the Troubles?

28:49.395 --> 28:51.101
- I've been through
the Troubles twice,

28:51.480 --> 28:55.098
seen how it devastates
this town.

28:56.277 --> 28:59.269
Don't know what I wouldn't
sacrifice to stop the Troubles.

29:01.032 --> 29:02.363
Why?

29:03.701 --> 29:04.986
Do you have a way?

29:07.204 --> 29:08.580
- I need a gun.

29:09.540 --> 29:12.452
- Lucy, what are you going to do?

29:12.585 --> 29:14.166
- Please, Dave...

29:15.338 --> 29:16.828
just give me your gun.

29:23.179 --> 29:26.171
(engine turning over)

29:28.893 --> 29:31.760
- That took a long time.
What did Lucy want?

29:34.065 --> 29:35.430
-Agun.

29:36.359 --> 29:38.441
Lucy wanted a gun.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.692
Our Lucy.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.818
Why?
- We don't have time to find out.

29:44.951 --> 29:47.408
- Well, whatever she's doing,
she was scared to death.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.037
But I know one thing for sure.

29:49.163 --> 29:53.497
She's fighting for this town,
fighting for us.

29:53.626 --> 29:55.958
- Dave!
- Vince, ifl run today,

29:56.337 --> 29:59.079
what's to say
this... this... this Croatoan

29:59.215 --> 30:01.456
won't find me tomorrow
or the next day?

30:01.592 --> 30:02.547
- Nothing, but...

30:02.677 --> 30:07.467
- So your whole plan might wind up
accomplishing absolutely nothing.

30:07.598 --> 30:08.758
Isn't that right?

30:08.891 --> 30:10.392
(sighs)

30:10.518 --> 30:13.476
This Croatoan, can it be killed?

30:13.896 --> 30:16.854
- Charlotte was of his kind,
and she was mortal.

30:17.775 --> 30:19.731
But I don't know for certain.

30:19.860 --> 30:21.475
- Well, I know something for certain.

30:21.612 --> 30:25.025
I can either run and save myself,

30:25.157 --> 30:30.026
or I can stay and fight, like Lucy.

30:31.872 --> 30:34.534
Which one
would you rather do, brother?

30:34.667 --> 30:37.625
- Dave, if we can't kill him,

30:38.546 --> 30:39.877
you're doomed.

30:46.971 --> 30:49.929
Fine.
Then let's go kill the bastard.

30:58.315 --> 30:59.816
- Hey, don't look so sad.

31:01.610 --> 31:03.225
I'll see you again someday.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.444
Maybe all this
will come back to you.

31:07.700 --> 31:10.362
Maybe you'll remember me this time.
- Maybe.

31:11.078 --> 31:14.115
Let's enjoy the time
that we have left.

31:15.041 --> 31:17.999
Come on, walk with me.

31:20.546 --> 31:24.038
I don't know if I ever told you
how I felt when you found me.

31:27.261 --> 31:29.126
- Relieved?
(chuckles)

31:31.265 --> 31:35.178
- When I discovered who I am,
I felt like a visitor in my own life...

31:35.728 --> 31:39.562
Just passing through,
no connection, but...

31:41.067 --> 31:43.058
You changed all that.

31:43.861 --> 31:46.648
You made me feel connected.

31:48.282 --> 31:50.694
And I love you for that, James.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.498
- I love you too.

31:59.168 --> 32:02.160
I'm sorry we couldn't find
another way to stop the Troubles.

32:04.131 --> 32:05.507
(sighs)

32:05.633 --> 32:07.464
Keep you out
of that damn Barn.

32:11.305 --> 32:14.342
Mom, are you okay?
You're shaking.

32:14.475 --> 32:16.716
- Oh, I'm just... I'm cold.

32:18.145 --> 32:20.887
Would you be able to get
my sweater out of the car?

32:21.357 --> 32:23.018
- Sure.

32:24.735 --> 32:26.236
I'll be right back.

32:30.199 --> 32:32.986
Oh, don't be surprised
if when you come back,

32:33.119 --> 32:34.199
you have a few grandkids.

32:34.620 --> 32:35.985
Arla wants three.

32:36.122 --> 32:37.487
(chuckles)

32:40.292 --> 32:43.750
(breathing shakily)

32:45.506 --> 32:47.497
- I love you, James.

32:49.844 --> 32:51.175
(sighs)

33:00.479 --> 33:03.016
- Lucy, no.
You can't do this.

33:03.149 --> 33:05.435
- I have to.
You don't understand.

33:05.568 --> 33:06.978
- Yes, I do.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.229
James...

33:08.904 --> 33:10.405
he's my son.

33:12.158 --> 33:14.615
- What?
- Our son.

33:22.918 --> 33:24.658
We have to stay out of this.

33:24.795 --> 33:28.162
- I... I heard you talking
to Garland.

33:28.299 --> 33:30.881
You said that you were
from the future, not the past.

33:31.010 --> 33:34.298
- I've gone back in time before to Sarah.

33:34.972 --> 33:37.008
- I knew from the minute I met you,

33:37.141 --> 33:38.551
there was something between us.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.970
- Yes.

33:42.313 --> 33:44.053
- He looks like you.

33:44.190 --> 33:46.647
And you came back to save him.

33:46.775 --> 33:49.027
- No.
- To save us.

33:49.153 --> 33:52.065
- That's not why I came back.
- But that's what you just did.

33:52.198 --> 33:54.655
You stopped me from killing
my son, our son.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.319
- Because it would have ended
the Troubles

33:56.452 --> 33:58.693
by killing
every Troubled person.

34:00.789 --> 34:02.620
I'm not here to save you, Lucy...

34:04.293 --> 34:05.453
or James.

34:06.795 --> 34:07.750
(brakes squeal)

34:07.880 --> 34:09.711
- Barbara Colton, stop!

34:13.469 --> 34:14.709
- I was right.

34:15.304 --> 34:17.044
She makes temporary Thinnies.

34:17.473 --> 34:18.462
- What?

34:24.730 --> 34:27.187
- Doors to another world.

34:27.316 --> 34:30.979
I need one in Haven in the future.
That's why I came back.

34:32.738 --> 34:33.898
- Mom!

34:34.031 --> 34:35.487
- James.
- Hey.

34:37.826 --> 34:39.032
- Who is that?

34:39.161 --> 34:40.446
- Wait. What is he doing?

34:40.579 --> 34:43.491
- Damn it.
He's trying to change the past.

34:49.171 --> 34:50.377
- Dave!

35:04.687 --> 35:06.097
- What's wrong with him?

35:06.230 --> 35:08.095
- Dave's gone through the thinny.

35:09.066 --> 35:10.556
Croatoan has him.

35:11.568 --> 35:12.853
It's started.

35:14.196 --> 35:15.561
- He's heading towards James.

35:15.698 --> 35:16.733
- Lucy...

35:18.200 --> 35:20.031
this is what I was trying
to tell you.

35:21.870 --> 35:25.579
He's gonna kill James,
and we can't stop it.

35:25.708 --> 35:26.743
- Oh, yes, we can.

35:26.875 --> 35:29.127
- This has to happen.

35:29.253 --> 35:32.620
- No! There must be something
we can do.

35:32.756 --> 35:33.745
- It's too risky.

35:33.882 --> 35:36.419
Changing the past with something
as big as this,

35:36.552 --> 35:38.668
it could destroy us all.

35:38.804 --> 35:42.262
It almost did when you tried
to kill our son.

35:42.391 --> 35:44.302
- No.
- But now I know

35:44.435 --> 35:45.800
that a Colton makes Thinnies,

35:45.936 --> 35:48.018
and I can take that information
to my world,

35:48.147 --> 35:49.978
and maybe I can save Haven
for good.

35:50.774 --> 35:52.560
- But he's my son.

35:53.944 --> 35:55.525
He's your son.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.736
- We can't save him.

35:58.615 --> 36:00.230
He has to die.

36:02.244 --> 36:03.654
He already did.
(whimpers)

36:05.581 --> 36:06.741
(gaSDS)

36:18.969 --> 36:21.927
(cries)
- Oh, God.

37:10.813 --> 37:13.145
(gaSDS)

37:52.896 --> 37:55.888
(seagulls crying)

37:59.236 --> 38:03.149
(indistinct chatter)

38:03.282 --> 38:06.274
(indistinct chatter
over police radio)

38:12.958 --> 38:15.290
(camera shutter clicks)

38:18.839 --> 38:21.296
(Nathan): It's time to
find Mosley and go home.

38:29.850 --> 38:30.965
(Stuart): Who's that?

38:31.101 --> 38:32.432
(Nathan): That's you in the future.

38:39.693 --> 38:43.277
(footsteps approaching)

38:51.705 --> 38:53.741
Thanks.

38:53.874 --> 38:55.410
- You okay?

38:57.544 --> 38:58.920
- Watching...

39:00.756 --> 39:01.962
you...

39:02.090 --> 39:05.127
see our son die again...

39:05.886 --> 39:07.376
(sighs)

39:11.266 --> 39:13.382
- I'm sorry that you had
to go through that.

39:13.519 --> 39:15.510
- I almost wish I was still
on that beach

39:15.646 --> 39:17.728
when Croatoan
wiped everyone's memory.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.643
- Then you wouldn't remember
how Barbara Colton made the thinny.

39:21.151 --> 39:23.312
- She used a ring.

39:27.824 --> 39:29.109
This one.

39:29.785 --> 39:33.152
I guess my dad must have
gotten it back from her.

39:33.580 --> 39:37.118
- You think he would have
if you hadn't made it so important?

39:37.251 --> 39:40.914
- I don't know. All this time
he remembered me coming to him.

39:42.089 --> 39:44.080
He knew what was gonna happen.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.758
That actually explains a lot.

39:50.639 --> 39:53.927
We got to put this ring on a Colton.

39:54.393 --> 39:56.725
- I don't know how to tell you
this, Nathan, but...

39:59.231 --> 40:03.144
I wasn't able to find
a single Colton in all of Haven.

40:03.277 --> 40:04.357
- I know.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.356
There haven't been any
in town for years.

40:07.489 --> 40:09.605
- You knew them?
- I knew of them.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.322
Stories around the station.

40:12.619 --> 40:14.826
They're pretty notorious
petty criminals.

40:15.455 --> 40:17.491
I didn't realize
they were Troubled.

40:17.624 --> 40:20.286
- Without a Colton,
we cannot get into the Void,

40:20.419 --> 40:22.535
we cannot save
the future, so...

40:23.505 --> 40:25.712
your trip didn't change
anything.

40:25.841 --> 40:26.876
- No.

40:27.009 --> 40:28.590
It changed everything.

40:32.889 --> 40:35.426
- So you want to tell me
who the hell you are?

40:35.892 --> 40:38.759
- Saul Goodwin.
(sighs)

40:41.023 --> 40:44.390
- Saul, the kid whose stuff
I stole in elementary school.

40:44.526 --> 40:46.027
You were really
into photography.

40:46.695 --> 40:47.650
Wow.

40:48.196 --> 40:49.936
Way to hold
a grudge, buddy.

40:50.073 --> 40:52.530
- I don't remember you
from grade school.

40:52.868 --> 40:53.983
It's weird.

40:55.746 --> 40:57.577
- Because you don't remember Haven.

40:58.165 --> 41:01.703
- No, I don't.
- Then what the hell is all this?

41:04.921 --> 41:06.536
- I have something for you,

41:07.257 --> 41:09.999
but I couldn't give it to you
until today.

41:11.178 --> 41:15.012
I've kept track of you
for almost three decades.

41:16.141 --> 41:17.301
I got good at it,

41:18.769 --> 41:21.101
so good I finally started
my own firm.

41:21.521 --> 41:25.480
What's weird is
l have no idea why...

41:26.443 --> 41:28.809
I started watching
you anymore.

41:30.238 --> 41:32.194
I think
I used to know why.

41:34.326 --> 41:36.738
But anyway, now it's over.

41:37.579 --> 41:38.819
Right now.

41:50.425 --> 41:52.086
Good luck...

41:53.095 --> 41:54.301
Mr. Crocker.

41:55.180 --> 41:56.386
- Yeah.

41:58.475 --> 42:01.592
I'm sorry about stealing your stuff.
(chuckles)

42:05.899 --> 42:07.105
(door closes)

42:09.152 --> 42:12.394
(Nathan): "Duke, it’s Nathan
writing from 1983.

42:12.531 --> 42:15.273
"I guess it’s my turn
to write a letter from the past.

42:15.409 --> 42:17.570
"I know we didn’t end up
in a great place,

42:17.703 --> 42:19.409
"but I need your help.

42:19.538 --> 42:22.029
"I found a way to save Haven
once and for all,

42:22.165 --> 42:23.780
"but I can ’t do it without you.

42:24.376 --> 42:26.617
"I need you to ﬁnd a member
of the Colton family

42:26.753 --> 42:28.709
"and bring them back
through the shroud to Haven.

42:29.381 --> 42:31.747
Please.
I’m counting on you. "

42:31.883 --> 42:33.544
- Hailie.
