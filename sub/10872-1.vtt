25:00.806 --> 25:05.099
Police artists drew this sketch
for me two years ago.

25:05.101 --> 25:07.437
I've dealt with
the bastard before.

25:11.442 --> 25:13.858
You think you can find him?

25:13.860 --> 25:15.693
If he's back in this area, yes.

25:15.695 --> 25:17.945
But you'll have to be fast
because he moves his base

25:17.947 --> 25:19.906
of operations around
all the time.

25:19.908 --> 25:23.410
Excuse me.
The Wraith?

25:23.412 --> 25:25.203
The cold-blooded human
and drug trafficker

25:25.205 --> 25:26.454
that no one ever sees?

25:26.456 --> 25:27.955
And if they do,
they end up dead?

25:27.957 --> 25:29.874
Which is why they call him
the Wraith in the first place?

25:29.876 --> 25:31.335
That's who we're going after?

25:31.337 --> 25:33.711
Yes.

25:33.713 --> 25:36.214
But Jovalyn just said
he works globally.

25:36.216 --> 25:39.425
He's probably not even
in the Philippines right now.

25:39.427 --> 25:42.721
You lost an entire team
and almost got killed,

25:42.723 --> 25:46.226
and now it's rumored that
he has his own private army.

25:48.812 --> 25:51.230
Great.

25:51.232 --> 25:53.315
Why the hell can't
the police handle this?

25:53.317 --> 25:55.608
Because Lieutenant Kalalo
believes that some of the force

25:55.610 --> 25:57.903
is actually on
the Wraith's payroll.

25:57.905 --> 26:02.907
