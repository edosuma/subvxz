00:29.071 --> 00:31.606
- Just give me the keys.
- Give me the keys.

00:31.640 --> 00:32.707
Give me the keys.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.944
It's Kringle Time!

00:34.977 --> 00:37.079
There are, like,
forty people counting on me...

00:37.113 --> 00:39.181
Oh everyone's always
counting on you, Gary!

00:39.215 --> 00:41.217
Everyone always needs you, Gary!

00:41.250 --> 00:43.818
Gary, Gary, Gary, Gary!

00:43.852 --> 00:47.123
The spotlight shines
real bright, doesn't it, Gary?

00:47.156 --> 00:49.524
I know it's not
Mister Goddamn Wizard,

00:49.557 --> 00:51.994
but they still need someone
to run the fucking show

00:52.028 --> 00:53.528
and in order to run
the fucking show,

00:53.561 --> 00:55.097
I need to get
to the fucking show

00:55.131 --> 00:56.665
and in order to get
to the fucking show,

00:56.698 --> 00:59.668
I need the fucking car!

00:59.701 --> 01:01.070
Blinders, Jerry!

01:01.103 --> 01:03.172
My Car!

01:03.205 --> 01:05.141
So what if it's in your name?

01:31.067 --> 01:34.236
You are more than this.

01:34.270 --> 01:39.241
You are more than
the job you hold.

01:39.275 --> 01:45.780
You are more than
the town where you live.

01:45.814 --> 01:49.919
You are a shining ball
in the darkness of existence.

01:49.952 --> 01:51.786
We're at ten minutes, Jer.

01:51.820 --> 01:55.657
On my way.

02:02.898 --> 02:05.201
- Herb's not at set.
- What? Where is he?

02:05.234 --> 02:07.602
I don't know.
But he's not at set.

02:07.635 --> 02:10.940
Intern said he's not
in the dressing room either.

02:10.973 --> 02:13.742
Ten minutes!

02:13.775 --> 02:16.112
Hey Gunther, my trash
still hasn't been taken out.

02:16.145 --> 02:18.047
- <i>Fünf minuten.</i>
- It's been four days,

02:18.080 --> 02:19.547
can you take care of it, please?

02:19.581 --> 02:21.217
- <i>Jawohl!</i>
- Can you just say "Yes"

02:21.250 --> 02:23.919
- in the future?
- <i>Jawohl.</i>

02:23.953 --> 02:25.754
I don't speak German, Gunther.

02:27.089 --> 02:30.126
Hey... who are you...

02:30.159 --> 02:31.593
Have you seen Herb?

02:31.626 --> 02:35.031
Welcome to Goshen Public-Access,
Mr. Mayor.

02:35.064 --> 02:37.233
Oh, Jerry,
you've met Rodney, right?

02:37.266 --> 02:39.068
Mayor Jorkins, don't think
I've had the pleasure.

02:39.101 --> 02:40.936
Hiya Jerry,
the pleasure's all mine!

02:40.970 --> 02:42.104
Did you vote for me?

02:42.138 --> 02:44.974
I'm just joshin' ya!

02:45.007 --> 02:46.876
But did you vote for me?

02:46.909 --> 02:49.677
- Uh, Daphne?
- What!

02:49.711 --> 02:51.180
- Seen Herb?
- I haven't seen him.

02:51.213 --> 02:53.681
- The Herb?
- Very nice to meet you, sir.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.617
All right, love you, bye.

02:55.650 --> 02:57.819
- Meow, meow...
- You guys seen Herb?

02:57.852 --> 02:59.621
Jer-Bear, we're in the middle
of something.

02:59.654 --> 03:00.923
Please don't call me Jer-Bear,
I just want...

03:00.956 --> 03:03.259
♪ Leave us the fuck alone ♪

03:03.292 --> 03:04.193
Bye.

03:04.226 --> 03:05.928

03:05.961 --> 03:07.329
- Jerry, where the fuck is Herb?
- Looking for him right now.

03:07.363 --> 03:09.165
I need to mic him up
before we go live.

03:09.198 --> 03:11.133
Sound doesn't penetrate
a fucking snowsuit, Jerry.

03:11.167 --> 03:14.937
- I'm on it, Karen.
- Aw thanks, asshat.

03:14.970 --> 03:16.704
Six minutes.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.606
Good morning, Goshen.

03:18.640 --> 03:19.741
Morning.

03:19.774 --> 03:20.976
Good morning, Goshen!

03:21.010 --> 03:23.845
- Good morning Go-shen...
- Ernest!

03:23.879 --> 03:24.947
- Have you seen Herb?
- What?

03:24.980 --> 03:26.215
- Herb.
- What?

03:26.248 --> 03:29.952
I... I don't know, Jerry.

03:29.985 --> 03:31.387
Okay.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.155
Hey, have we checked
his dressing room?

03:33.189 --> 03:35.623
The sign on the door
says "In Kringle Time."

03:35.657 --> 03:37.126
I just assumed he's on set.

03:37.159 --> 03:38.894
- That's not what that means.
- What does it mean?

03:38.928 --> 03:40.728
Herb needs personal time
during the day.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.630
- He calls it "Kringle Time."
- Well it's also the name

03:42.664 --> 03:44.934
of the show,
so it's just confusing.

03:44.967 --> 03:48.003
It is confusing,
thank you, Greg.

03:48.037 --> 03:51.639
- Herb, we're at...
- Jerry, I have to quit.

03:51.673 --> 03:52.408
Wh... can we talk about this
later?

03:52.441 --> 03:55.643
No, I'm sorry.

04:02.084 --> 04:04.819
Herb, we gotta stop
burning through interns.

04:04.853 --> 04:07.923
It's this place, Jerry.

04:17.765 --> 04:19.868
When your dad and I
started this show,

04:19.902 --> 04:21.370
I never thought I'd be here now.

04:21.403 --> 04:22.837
We really don't have time
for this today.

04:22.871 --> 04:26.175
Three decades and here I am.

04:26.208 --> 04:30.045
Gathering dust inside
a fraying snowman.

04:30.079 --> 04:32.780
Doesn't sound so bad.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.117
You're a fuck-up, Jerry.

04:35.151 --> 04:40.022
You don't know nothing.

04:40.055 --> 04:46.395
Okay.

04:46.428 --> 04:48.230
- Hey, big love.
- Tell me the mantra again.

04:48.264 --> 04:49.398
Take the turn!

04:49.431 --> 04:51.100
Come on, Grayson, you fuck!

04:51.133 --> 04:53.235
Is that my daughter
on the phone?

04:53.269 --> 04:55.337
- Yes.
- ...At the fucking Hamptons!

04:55.371 --> 04:56.939
Herb won't come to set, what's
the thing you said last time?

04:56.972 --> 04:58.174
Come on, Grayson,
you're better than this.

04:58.207 --> 05:00.342
- What did you say last time?
- Oh.

05:00.376 --> 05:04.113
Tell him there's only
one Kringles.

05:04.146 --> 05:07.316
Can't control our legacy, Jerry.

05:07.349 --> 05:10.085
That's... that's
what I figured out.

05:10.119 --> 05:14.156
At the end of the day,
our life's just a...

05:14.190 --> 05:17.859
There's only one Kringles.

05:21.897 --> 05:23.499
Fuck it.

05:23.532 --> 05:25.767
Karen, found your snowman!

05:25.800 --> 05:28.437
- How you doing, love?
- For fuck's sake, Herb!

05:28.470 --> 05:30.272
Ugh, God, you smell
like piss on the rocks.

05:30.306 --> 05:31.974
- Yeah, well...
- We got two minutes!

05:32.007 --> 05:33.741
I feel like Brooklyn
is where I belong,

05:33.775 --> 05:35.743
but Manhattan is,
like, my soul.

05:35.777 --> 05:37.479
- Uptown or downtown?
- No, Manhattan.

05:37.513 --> 05:39.181
- You found Herb?
- Yeah.

05:39.215 --> 05:41.450
- Is he drunk?
- Where's the mayor?

05:41.483 --> 05:45.988
Oh Jesus.

05:46.021 --> 05:47.022
Mr. Mayor.

05:47.056 --> 05:49.391
Is this 4K, or what?

05:49.425 --> 05:50.792
Yeah, it's great, huh?

05:50.825 --> 05:52.127
Don't wander off.

05:52.161 --> 05:54.129
- Yeah, great technology.
- Mhm.

05:54.163 --> 05:58.934
- You use three cameras on this?
- That's right.

05:58.968 --> 06:02.071
Herb, you good?

06:02.104 --> 06:04.039
As good as it gets, Jer.

06:08.544 --> 06:11.547
Meant to say that kids
are the bane of my existence,

06:11.580 --> 06:15.251
but that's, you know, you do
what you gotta do, right?

06:15.284 --> 06:16.885
This place that I got
in Brooklyn...

06:16.919 --> 06:18.820
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
we are live in...

06:18.853 --> 06:20.289

- Nope, up one.

06:29.864 --> 06:31.866

Kringles got a letter!

What does it say, Kringles?

08:15.204 --> 08:17.039
Let's find out, Jaxon.

08:25.981 --> 08:27.015
Let's see here.

"Dear Kringles..."

"Dear Kringles..."

08:56.345 --> 09:00.549
S... sorry Kringles...

09:00.582 --> 09:03.986
is having a...

09:09.625 --> 09:12.694
Should I cut, Jerry?

09:12.728 --> 09:15.431
Herb, Herb! Don't say anything
and do not...

09:15.464 --> 09:16.999
Call 911!

09:19.501 --> 09:21.437
Get the goddamn suit off of him!

09:24.339 --> 09:25.541
Would you stop!

09:25.574 --> 09:27.009
I'm trying to help!

09:27.042 --> 09:30.279
Just call the goddamn ambulance!

09:30.312 --> 09:33.649
Jerry, how do I cut again?

09:33.682 --> 09:35.751
It's the red goddamn button,
Ethel!

09:39.154 --> 09:40.355
Come on, Herb.

09:47.095 --> 09:51.333
Never take off the...

10:48.190 --> 10:52.661
Thank you, Gunther.

10:52.694 --> 10:55.364
In accordance
with Herb's final wishes,

10:55.397 --> 10:58.500
his ashes will be scattered

10:58.534 --> 11:02.504
in this parking lot.

11:02.538 --> 11:09.411
Where he met his beloved
ex-wife, Sue Ann.

11:09.444 --> 11:12.548
His daughter, Layla,
who was also conceived

11:12.581 --> 11:18.854
in this parking lot,
will now say a few words.

11:18.888 --> 11:22.190
Sweetheart, you ready?

11:39.274 --> 11:43.712
My father was a snowman.

12:06.535 --> 12:09.838
Love you, daddy.

12:23.452 --> 12:28.690
What good can be said about Herb

12:28.724 --> 12:34.196
that was not already said
by Herb?

12:34.229 --> 12:39.801
He was a man who demanded
much from others.

12:39.835 --> 12:45.574
And less... much less
from himself.

12:45.607 --> 12:48.577
Oh god, the board
is miles up my ass.

12:48.610 --> 12:50.646
- They want to pull the plug.
- They can't do that.

12:50.679 --> 12:52.414
They can do anything they want.

12:52.447 --> 12:54.216
It's public-access.

12:54.249 --> 12:55.684
You're not gonna let them.

12:55.717 --> 13:02.892
I don't want to make enemies,
Jer.

13:02.925 --> 13:06.528
They're giving me one show, Jer.

13:06.561 --> 13:12.501
A comeback show to de-traumatize
the kids or whatever.

13:12.534 --> 13:14.803
Well that oughta be fun,
without a Kringles.

13:14.836 --> 13:17.907
Our target audience
is five-year-olds.

13:17.940 --> 13:19.875
We could swap the body out
of that suit mid-episode

13:19.909 --> 13:23.980
and they wouldn't notice.

13:24.013 --> 13:26.281
You, uh...

13:26.314 --> 13:29.651
got someone in mind or?

13:29.685 --> 13:31.486
From where I'm standing,

13:31.520 --> 13:36.558
I can see one person
who could do the job right now.

13:36.591 --> 13:38.928
You mean?

13:38.961 --> 13:40.862
Over there, Jerry.

13:40.897 --> 13:44.232
Look where I'm looking.

13:44.266 --> 13:46.868
What, Mark? That guy's an idiot.

13:46.903 --> 13:50.272
- He's young, he's handsome.
- Who cares if he's handsome?

13:50.305 --> 13:51.707
He's gonna be inside
of a snowman.

13:51.740 --> 13:53.275
- He's great with the kids.
- Yeah

13:53.308 --> 13:56.012
because they recognize
their own kind.

13:56.045 --> 13:58.580
Trust me, Jerry, he's the one.

13:58.613 --> 14:02.317
You are looking at
the future of Kringle Time.

14:02.350 --> 14:06.722
Hopefully,
for a good many years.

14:09.892 --> 14:10.993
Daphne.

14:11.027 --> 14:13.528
Yeah?

14:13.562 --> 14:15.764
- I quit...
- Excuse me,

14:15.797 --> 14:17.566
are we ready to do this?

14:17.599 --> 14:18.867
Yeah, let's do it!

14:18.901 --> 14:20.736
Come on, let's go.

14:27.009 --> 14:28.844
Ready for what?

14:30.812 --> 14:35.250
Okay, uh, thank you all for,
uh, for coming.

14:38.553 --> 14:40.990
"I, Herbert Lott Kelley,

14:41.023 --> 14:42.824
resident of the City of Goshen,

14:42.858 --> 14:46.062
declare this document to be
my last will and testament.

14:46.095 --> 14:47.964
To Gunther, I
leave my collection

14:47.997 --> 14:50.332
of presidential
commemorative coins.

14:50.365 --> 14:53.301
I trust you know
what to do with them.

14:53.335 --> 14:57.974
To the current Mayor of Goshen"
that would be Mr. Jorkins

14:58.007 --> 15:01.309
"I bequeath the hon..." Why are
you... you don't have to stand.

15:01.343 --> 15:03.946
I'm just gonna, like, rattatat

15:03.980 --> 15:04.981
Okay.

15:05.014 --> 15:07.582
Thank you.

15:07.616 --> 15:09.886
"To the current Mayor of Goshen,
I bequeath the honor

15:09.919 --> 15:13.722
of erecting a statue
in my likeness..."

15:13.755 --> 15:18.995
Jerry, he said "erecting."

15:19.028 --> 15:21.097
- It would be my great honor...
- Why are you...

15:21.130 --> 15:23.799
To erect a statue of Herb.

15:23.832 --> 15:25.534
Could you write that down,
that it would be my great honor?

15:25.567 --> 15:26.903
- No, that's not my job.
- Okay, sure.

15:26.936 --> 15:29.437
- Could you just...
- I accept this task.

15:29.471 --> 15:31.673
All right, here we go.

15:31.706 --> 15:34.110
"To my beautiful daughter,
Layla, I bequeath my house..."

15:34.143 --> 15:35.844
Present.

15:35.878 --> 15:40.883
"And all possessions in it,
unless otherwise noted."

15:40.917 --> 15:44.954
"And next, the role
of Kringles the Snowman,

15:44.987 --> 15:47.890
including snowman suit
and all paraphernalia"

15:47.924 --> 15:51.493
in my dressing room, including
my safe and its contents

15:51.526 --> 15:54.897
are hereby bequeathed
to Jericho Perkins."

15:58.867 --> 16:02.138
Who the hell's that?

16:06.474 --> 16:09.444
Jerry, can I talk
to you for a second?

16:09.477 --> 16:11.847
Uh.

16:11.881 --> 16:14.583
Production meeting,
4 o'clock tomorrow.

16:14.616 --> 16:16.953
You're gonna graciously
step down and pass the torch

16:16.986 --> 16:20.990

over there.

16:21.023 --> 16:23.960

Jerry Perkins.

16:25.962 --> 16:30.498

The show was his life.

17:41.170 --> 17:43.805
You know, growing up, I probably
saw him more often in that suit

17:43.838 --> 17:45.540
than I saw him out of it.

17:50.112 --> 17:54.482
I'm not asking you
to put me through what he did.

17:54.516 --> 17:57.186

So the studio's down there,
just a heads-up,

19:58.074 --> 19:59.808
we had to disable
these smoke detectors.

19:59.841 --> 20:01.010

As you know, I've been
entrusted with the task

21:47.349 --> 21:49.717
of building a statue of Herb
and I was hoping

21:49.751 --> 21:51.921
to grab a couple of minutes
of your time.

21:51.954 --> 21:53.322
I've never worked on
statues before,

Yeah, that's uh, uh-huh.

22:05.935 --> 22:10.272
Great, well we'll circle back
around on the statue later then.

22:10.306 --> 22:13.042
Personally, I think
the bronze works great,

22:13.075 --> 22:16.212
but that's just my opinion.

22:16.245 --> 22:18.380
Yeah, it's in Williamsburg.

22:18.414 --> 22:20.782

22:42.271 --> 22:45.174
Ah, okay.

22:45.207 --> 22:47.009
Hey Jerry, Jerry,
if you respected yourself

22:47.042 --> 22:48.510
a little more, you'd probably
fix a lot of problems

22:48.544 --> 22:53.048
at work, bro, and at home!

22:53.082 --> 22:54.283
Okay, great.

22:54.316 --> 22:57.920
Um, so look I, uh...

22:57.953 --> 23:00.089

23:00.122 --> 23:03.825
Okay, I... I believe

23:03.858 --> 23:07.529
I've given my life to this
station because of Kringle Time.

23:14.536 --> 23:17.139
I started writing down
my ideas for the show.

23:17.172 --> 23:21.877
And more than anything
in the entire world

23:21.910 --> 23:22.978

Jerry.

25:06.048 --> 25:09.985
Who is Kringles?

25:10.018 --> 25:12.488
Kringles is a magical
snowman from Alaska

25:12.521 --> 25:14.323
who was brought to life
by an ice wizard.

25:14.356 --> 25:16.592
He's fueled by the power
of wishes.

25:16.625 --> 25:18.494
Hm, wrong.

25:18.527 --> 25:20.229
Kringles is a knock-off Frosty

25:20.262 --> 25:21.964
the station
didn't have to license.

25:21.997 --> 25:25.601
Okay, Kringles is way different
than Frosty the Snowman,

25:25.634 --> 25:27.669
- that's...
- Oh, how?

25:27.703 --> 25:29.705
Uh, well he has a lasso,
for one thing.

25:29.738 --> 25:32.674
Hm, and why does a snowman
need a lasso, Jerry?

25:32.708 --> 25:34.376
Uh, because, Daphne,

25:34.410 --> 25:36.612
the lasso contains the spirit
of Arizona Willie,

25:36.645 --> 25:38.113
which of course
can only be summoned

25:38.147 --> 25:39.648
with the magical chant
by the children.

25:39.681 --> 25:41.984
Scrip-a-doo-banana-jamma,
I don't really understand

25:42.017 --> 25:43.719
the question,
it's in the goddamn song.

25:43.752 --> 25:46.955
Yeah but... look, I'm not gonna
have this argument with you.

25:46.989 --> 25:48.991
Kringles was the cheapest
costume they could afford,

25:49.024 --> 25:50.559
and it went from there.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.995
My apologies, I should have been
a little more specific...

25:53.028 --> 25:54.062
Listen to the goddamn song.

25:54.096 --> 25:58.333
Who is Kringles to you?

25:58.367 --> 26:00.169
What?

26:00.202 --> 26:02.638
Who is Kringles to you?

26:07.176 --> 26:11.113
Kringles taught me
right from wrong.

26:11.146 --> 26:14.416
He told me to believe in myself.

26:17.519 --> 26:20.756
He was my first friend.

26:20.789 --> 26:22.124
Right.

26:25.661 --> 26:29.765
Now say we do...

26:29.798 --> 26:35.370
whatever that is
and it hits home with one kid,

26:35.404 --> 26:40.075
one future Jerry out there
who really connects with it.

26:40.108 --> 26:43.779
But in doing so, we've robbed
a hundred other normal kids

26:43.812 --> 26:45.180
of that relationship
with Kringles

26:45.214 --> 26:47.483
that you just mentioned.

26:47.516 --> 26:49.785
Does that seem worth it, Jerry?

28:29.718 --> 28:33.555
Good morning Goshen.

28:33.589 --> 28:36.625
Goshen, city of Goshen.

28:36.658 --> 28:39.795
Goshen Public Works
announced that the pothole

28:39.828 --> 28:43.632
on 2nd and Gage
has been filled in.

28:43.665 --> 28:48.136
I guess you could call it
a not-hole now.

28:48.170 --> 28:50.572
And fear not, snowman fans.

28:50.606 --> 28:52.307
Because it's been confirmed

28:52.341 --> 28:55.477
that Kringles The Snowman
will live on.

28:55.510 --> 28:59.214
In the capable hands
of Jerry Perkins.

28:59.247 --> 29:01.850
So tune in on Saturday
at the regular time,

29:01.884 --> 29:04.586
coming up this Saturday.

29:04.620 --> 29:06.655

all wish Jerry...

29:06.688 --> 29:09.591
Let's wish Jerry good times.

29:09.625 --> 29:11.560

29:37.219 --> 29:39.655
Jerry, how we doing, buddy?

29:39.688 --> 29:42.357
You ready to get started?
You feel good? You look good.

29:42.391 --> 29:43.859

- All right.

29:43.893 --> 29:46.695
Pow pow!

29:46.728 --> 29:48.697
- Pow!
- Pow.

29:48.730 --> 29:50.499
Keep it positive,
keep it fresh, keep it bright

29:50.532 --> 29:52.200
and we're gonna do it big, okay?

29:52.234 --> 29:53.268
Just like every day. Here we go.

29:53.301 --> 29:54.904
Five, six, seven, eight.

29:58.807 --> 30:00.609
Ugh!

30:02.444 --> 30:04.379
Good girl.

30:04.413 --> 30:06.248
Dog Store,
this is Layla speaking.

30:06.281 --> 30:08.517
I can't do it. I'm freaking out.

30:08.550 --> 30:11.286
- Just breathe, Jerry.
- I'm too old.

30:11.319 --> 30:14.556
I'm old and I'm soft
and I'm gonna die someday.

30:14.589 --> 30:17.292
- You're not gonna die, Jerry.
- We're all gonna die!

30:17.325 --> 30:19.861
And I'm gonna be forgotten,
like George Lazenby.

30:19.896 --> 30:22.564
- Who?
- That's what I mean.

30:22.597 --> 30:24.499
He was James Bond, Layla.

30:24.533 --> 30:25.767
Freaking James Bond!

30:25.801 --> 30:27.904
And now he's dead and forgotten.

30:27.937 --> 30:29.972
Or maybe he's still alive.
I don't know, I don't know.

30:30.006 --> 30:32.240
Nobody knows, you know why?
Because nobody gives a fuck

30:32.274 --> 30:33.943
about George Lazenby!

30:33.976 --> 30:35.912
You know the combination
to your dad's safe?

30:35.945 --> 30:37.646
- I don't.
- He left me a safe

30:37.679 --> 30:39.581
with no combination,
I mean, who does that?

30:39.614 --> 30:41.850
I gotta go, babe, okay?

30:41.884 --> 30:44.252
There's whiskey in here
and I need it.

30:44.286 --> 30:49.458
You're gonna do great,
all right, just...

30:49.491 --> 30:52.394
- Big love.
- Big love.

31:02.304 --> 31:04.372
You are more than this...

31:30.532 --> 31:32.034
Dad?

31:34.536 --> 31:36.505
Blinders, Jerry.

31:45.982 --> 31:49.751
- Hey there, Jerry.
- Shit.

31:54.389 --> 31:55.390
Hey, what are you doing?

31:55.423 --> 31:56.993
I'm fine, I'm fine.

31:57.026 --> 32:00.562
- Are you jerkin' it, dude?
- What? No. I'm not... no.

32:00.595 --> 32:04.666
- Hey guys, Jerry's jerking it!
- I'm not jerking it!

32:04.699 --> 32:06.368
God.

32:06.401 --> 32:08.971
Hey man, have a good jerk.

32:09.005 --> 32:12.440
I'm not... I'm not jerk... Naveed!

32:18.413 --> 32:19.648
Hiya Jerry, Mayor Jorkins.

32:19.681 --> 32:22.517
Yes sir, we've met
numerous times.

32:22.551 --> 32:23.953
- You got a minute?
- I'm actually really busy,

32:23.986 --> 32:25.487
- I've got a...
- It'll just take a second.

32:25.520 --> 32:26.521
I'm sorry I gotta...

32:27.990 --> 32:29.457
- What am I doing?
- No, no.

32:29.491 --> 32:30.759
Come on, you want some coffee?

32:30.792 --> 32:32.427
Let's get some coffee.

32:32.460 --> 32:34.462
Yeah, okay.

32:34.496 --> 32:36.132
I can't do it, Jerry.

32:36.165 --> 32:38.100
I'm not gonna get it done,
and then I'm just gonna be

32:38.134 --> 32:40.136
some guy who didn't build
a statue at all.

32:40.169 --> 32:42.004
- Okay, hey, here you go.
- Thank you, Jerry.

32:42.038 --> 32:44.539
Yeah.

32:47.977 --> 32:49.678
That's hot.

32:49.711 --> 32:50.779
It's a fresh pot.

32:50.812 --> 32:54.016
Mm.

32:54.050 --> 32:55.717
I should just quit.

32:55.750 --> 32:57.153
I don't know why
I thought I could do this.

32:57.186 --> 33:00.089
Hey, look, it's just a statue.

33:00.122 --> 33:01.891
I mean, don't kill yourself
building a monument

33:01.924 --> 33:05.527
to Herb's massive ego.

33:05.560 --> 33:08.931
Just a statue?

33:08.965 --> 33:11.399
No, Jerry.

33:11.433 --> 33:13.970
A statue is history.

33:14.003 --> 33:16.605
A statue is important.

33:16.638 --> 33:20.775
A statue looks
to the future and says,

33:20.809 --> 33:25.915
"Hey future, I'm dead.

33:25.948 --> 33:28.850
But I wasn't always dead.

33:28.885 --> 33:33.923
And when I was alive...

33:33.956 --> 33:37.193
I mattered."

33:37.226 --> 33:39.095
You just need a little help.

33:39.128 --> 33:42.697
Look, hey, there's this guy who
helped Gunther a few years ago

33:42.731 --> 33:44.066
put the wainscoting in out back,

33:44.100 --> 33:45.800
maybe he's still
got his contact.

33:45.834 --> 33:47.036
I'll ask him, all right?

33:47.069 --> 33:50.739
Hey Gunther... Jesus.

33:50.772 --> 33:55.577
You still got the card
for that guy who...

33:55.610 --> 33:58.881
Thank you, Gunther.

33:58.915 --> 34:01.017
Here, maybe that'll help.

34:01.050 --> 34:02.817
Give him a call.

34:02.851 --> 34:05.587
- Thanks, Jerry.
- Yeah.

34:05.620 --> 34:07.589
Oh, what are we?

34:07.622 --> 34:09.456
Okay, all right.

34:09.491 --> 34:12.995
- Thank you, Jerry.
- Oh god.

34:13.029 --> 34:15.463
All right, why don't... no, no.

34:15.496 --> 34:17.233
This is a lot.

34:17.266 --> 34:18.466
- Zip.
- Zap.

34:18.500 --> 34:19.501
- Zip.
- Zap.

34:19.534 --> 34:20.467
- Zap.
- Zip.

34:20.502 --> 34:21.070
- Zip.
- Zap.

34:21.103 --> 34:21.603
- Zip,
- Zap.

34:21.636 --> 34:24.239
- Zip.
- Zip... oh.

34:24.273 --> 34:26.976
- You guys are coming for me.
- Guys?

34:27.009 --> 34:28.210
It's okay,
it's all right, buddy.

34:28.244 --> 34:29.577
Let's do it again, do it again.

34:29.610 --> 34:30.947
- Guys?
- What, Jerry?

34:30.980 --> 34:32.882
- This shit again.
- What's up, Jerry?

34:32.915 --> 34:36.118
I just want to say um...

34:36.152 --> 34:37.686
I know you guys don't think
I can do this...

34:37.719 --> 34:40.487
Oh my God,
you're like a broken record.

34:40.522 --> 34:44.126
Shut up,
this is a different thing.

34:44.159 --> 34:46.161
I don't want to fight you guys,
okay?

34:46.195 --> 34:50.933
And I'm not going to,
I want to be a team player.

34:50.967 --> 34:53.101
I've been given
a huge opportunity here,

34:53.135 --> 34:55.972
and I just, uh...

34:56.005 --> 34:59.574
I won't let you down.

35:02.211 --> 35:03.845
What are you doing?

35:06.815 --> 35:08.616
We miss him too, bro.

35:13.122 --> 35:14.991
Feeling strong there today, Jer.

35:15.024 --> 35:17.759
Okay, remember,
it's absolutely not Christmas.

35:17.792 --> 35:19.627
And here we go.

36:27.129 --> 36:29.831
- Do the wiggy, wiggy way.
- Ah!

36:29.864 --> 36:31.699
Yeah, they invited me
out for drinks.

36:31.733 --> 36:33.635
- Oh that's great, Jer!
- I know, right?

36:33.668 --> 36:36.671
Hey, is it all right
if I miss the race?

36:36.704 --> 36:39.008
Yeah, sure.

36:39.041 --> 36:40.309
Great.

I'll see you later tonight.

36:43.245 --> 36:45.047

36:49.018 --> 36:51.220
Okay, okay, Kringles
Resurrection dress rehearsal,

36:51.253 --> 36:54.689
let's pick it up from
right before the cult chant.

36:54.722 --> 36:56.992
And cue, Jaxon.

36:57.026 --> 36:58.693
I'm so glad you're back,
Kringles!

36:58.726 --> 37:01.030
Oh thank you, Jaxon!

37:01.063 --> 37:05.067
And this time,
I promise I will live forever.

37:08.037 --> 37:10.072
We will never die!

37:10.106 --> 37:12.274
We will never die!

37:12.308 --> 37:14.376
- We will never die!
- Okay, okay, okay.

37:14.410 --> 37:16.278
You guys,
that sounds fucking great!

37:16.312 --> 37:20.648
We will never die!
We will never die!

37:20.682 --> 37:24.819
We will never die!
We will never die!

37:24.853 --> 37:26.989
We will never die.

37:39.068 --> 37:41.370
Then last week,
I fucked my sister's widower.

37:41.403 --> 37:44.240
I mean, his ass is incredible,
though.

37:44.273 --> 37:46.008
No, she died fine, it was...

37:46.041 --> 37:47.409
Yeah? Oh, all right.

37:47.443 --> 37:49.345
Hey, Father?
Yeah, I gotta go.

37:49.378 --> 37:52.181
All right, love you, bye.
Yes, Jerry?

37:52.214 --> 37:55.850
Uh, I just had a question
about the script.

37:55.885 --> 37:58.254
Okay?

37:58.287 --> 37:59.721
It seems like we're
kind of telling kids

37:59.754 --> 38:02.824
that death doesn't matter.

38:02.857 --> 38:05.361
Hmm, it's interesting
you picked up on that,

38:05.394 --> 38:07.829
because that's exactly
what we're telling them.

38:07.862 --> 38:12.134
Ah and you don't think
that's kind of um...

38:12.168 --> 38:14.203
I don't know...

38:14.236 --> 38:17.206
uh, irresponsible?

38:17.239 --> 38:19.841
Do you remember
our conversation, Jerry?

38:19.874 --> 38:22.411
About giving people
what they want?

38:22.444 --> 38:25.114
You know what kids want?

38:25.147 --> 38:26.482
Death.

38:26.515 --> 38:29.018
They love it.

38:29.051 --> 38:31.253
I'm fucking with you, Jerry!

38:31.287 --> 38:33.721
Kids hate death,
they want their snowman alive,

38:33.755 --> 38:35.925
- that's what they want.
- It just seems like this

38:35.958 --> 38:40.930
could be like
a teachable moment, or...

38:40.963 --> 38:44.433
Come here.

38:44.466 --> 38:45.968
Sit.

38:46.001 --> 38:48.904
Now, I was waiting
to give this to you.

38:48.938 --> 38:54.876
Partly out of vindictiveness,
I'll admit, but...

38:54.910 --> 38:57.146
- The magic lasso?
- Mhm.

39:03.385 --> 39:06.754
You've earned it, Jerry.

39:10.392 --> 39:11.994
Now.

39:12.027 --> 39:14.129
I don't want you
to worry about the script.

39:14.163 --> 39:15.297
Okay?

39:15.331 --> 39:19.268
Kringles is a symbol.

39:19.301 --> 39:23.973
What good would it do
to ruin that, huh?

39:24.006 --> 39:25.840
It's the night before the show.

39:25.873 --> 39:30.879
I want you to take Layla out
for a nice dinner and celebrate.

39:30.913 --> 39:34.816
Make her feel like a real woman,
can you do that, Jerry?

39:34.849 --> 39:36.418
Yeah?

39:36.452 --> 39:39.154
Good boy.

39:39.188 --> 39:42.224
Woo, I do not plan on
being the executive director

39:42.258 --> 39:46.495
of a public-access station
my whole life, Jerry.

39:46.528 --> 39:51.033
Tomorrow, everything changes.

40:01.010 --> 40:02.844
To Kringles.

40:06.215 --> 40:07.483
Yep.

40:16.091 --> 40:18.327
Daphne gave me the lasso today.

40:18.360 --> 40:20.229
Didn't Dad leave
you that in his will?

40:20.262 --> 40:26.502
No... yeah, he did,
she just gave it to me today.

40:26.535 --> 40:28.170
Okay.

40:28.203 --> 40:29.305
Cool.

40:34.043 --> 40:35.277
Are you, like,
mad at me about something?

40:35.311 --> 40:37.446
No, I'm just hungry.

40:42.284 --> 40:45.554
Can you slow down, please?

40:45.587 --> 40:48.991
Excuse me? Lady, can you?

40:49.024 --> 40:51.460
Just bring the
whole fucking bottle.

40:51.493 --> 40:53.929
Thank you.

40:57.333 --> 40:59.401
- It feels like you're mad at me.
- No, I'm not mad at you, Jerry,

40:59.435 --> 41:03.038
I just had a long day going
through my dead father's shit.

41:03.072 --> 41:04.340
So what, you want to eat dinner
at home every night

41:04.373 --> 41:06.275
for the rest of your life?

41:10.512 --> 41:13.949
I'm going to the bathroom.

41:13.982 --> 41:16.285
- To poop, Jerry!
- Okay.

41:28.564 --> 41:31.266
- What's the matter, cowpoke?
- Jesus Christ!

41:31.300 --> 41:33.102
No.

41:33.135 --> 41:37.039
There is only Kringles.

41:44.446 --> 41:46.348
Are you?

41:46.382 --> 41:49.651
Uh, man!

42:47.443 --> 42:51.313
Think of the children.

43:31.086 --> 43:32.621
Can we go home?

43:32.654 --> 43:34.656
I'm tired.

43:39.495 --> 43:45.801
Ugh.

43:47.436 --> 43:52.241
You ready?

43:52.274 --> 43:55.210
You need to puke?

43:55.244 --> 43:56.445
Are you not opening your mouth
'cause you're afraid

43:56.478 --> 44:02.518
you're gonna puke?

44:02.551 --> 44:06.121
You'll be fine,
big guy, come on!

44:06.154 --> 44:08.056
Right?

44:08.090 --> 44:09.791
I mean, you better be fine.

44:09.825 --> 44:14.096
'Cause this show has
got to be fucking spectacular.

44:14.129 --> 44:16.598
You read me, Jerry?

44:16.632 --> 44:18.600
Hey.

44:18.634 --> 44:20.235
All right.

44:20.269 --> 44:23.772
Love yah, see you on the ice.

44:40.689 --> 44:43.392
Fade up twelve.

44:54.336 --> 44:55.737
Oh no, Kringles fell down!

44:55.771 --> 44:58.440
What can we do?

44:58.473 --> 45:01.643
Well, Jaxon,
sometimes people fall down

45:01.677 --> 45:03.812
and don't get back up again.

45:03.845 --> 45:07.849
And Kringles...

45:07.884 --> 45:10.285
Oh, what?

45:10.319 --> 45:12.120
I'm alive!

45:16.525 --> 45:18.226
'Atta baby, Jer.

45:18.260 --> 45:20.529
Stand by, camera two.

45:30.572 --> 45:34.376
Kringles is back, baby!

45:34.409 --> 45:36.845
Um, excuse me.

45:36.879 --> 45:39.581
- Jerry?
- I got it, I got it.

45:39.615 --> 45:40.917
Thank you all so much.

45:40.950 --> 45:42.451
This has really been
a dream come true,

45:42.484 --> 45:44.820
and I just want to thank
every single one of you

45:44.853 --> 45:46.321
for making it happen!

45:46.355 --> 45:47.556
To Jerry!

46:07.910 --> 46:10.579
Suck my dick, Luigi.

46:39.441 --> 46:40.475
Heather!

46:40.509 --> 46:41.710
Right? The intern!

46:41.743 --> 46:43.278
Yeah!

46:43.311 --> 46:46.581
Man, you were there for what?
Six, seven?

46:46.615 --> 46:49.651
A day. I was there for a day.

46:49.685 --> 46:53.755
Was it a day?

46:53.789 --> 46:55.323
Oh, well, you know what?

46:55.357 --> 46:56.993
We miss you Heather,
wish you could have stayed.

46:57.026 --> 46:59.896
Me too. What'll you have, Jerry?

46:59.929 --> 47:01.763
- You know, I'm gonna have a...
- Jerry!

47:01.797 --> 47:06.768
Mayor Jorkins, oh, you're so
handsome!

47:06.802 --> 47:09.304
Hey Jerry, great news
on the Herb statue.

47:09.337 --> 47:10.872
I called that guy,
I paid him extra.

47:10.907 --> 47:13.475
I had to do a little creative
thing with the finances

47:13.508 --> 47:15.877
so people wouldn't, you know,
taxpayer... but anyway!

47:15.912 --> 47:17.412
It's gonna be ready
in two weeks!

47:17.446 --> 47:19.548
Two weeks, ah!

47:19.581 --> 47:22.284
I'm spending so much money on
this, and I am loving it.

47:22.317 --> 47:23.652
You're really building
a statue for that guy?

47:23.685 --> 47:25.787
Damn right, baby,
seventy feet tall!

47:25.821 --> 47:26.989
It's gonna be
about six feet tall.

47:27.023 --> 47:28.356
It's gonna block out the sun!

47:28.390 --> 47:29.992
It's roughly Herb-sized.

47:30.026 --> 47:33.795
- Can we have some shots?
- Two shots!

47:33.829 --> 47:37.532
Heather is the best
because she brings me shots.

47:37.566 --> 47:42.004
Here we go!

47:42.038 --> 47:44.372
Love you.

47:44.406 --> 47:46.341
Good job!

48:28.017 --> 48:35.357
You were a grumpy
son-of-a-bitch, Herb.

48:35.390 --> 48:37.659
But thank you.

49:12.761 --> 49:14.629
Oh.

49:20.869 --> 49:23.772
Oh!

49:33.782 --> 49:36.451
Oh shit.

50:09.784 --> 50:11.419
Hi there, Jerry.

50:11.453 --> 50:13.022
Hi, Herb.

50:13.055 --> 50:16.725
Now, if you're watching this,
I'm dead.

50:16.758 --> 50:18.426
Probably from liver failure,

50:18.460 --> 50:22.198
or a car accident,
or a shootout.

50:22.231 --> 50:27.469
You probably also realize
that I left you Kringles,

50:27.502 --> 50:30.538
which I think
is incredibly kind of me,

50:30.572 --> 50:34.542
so don't fuck it up, Jerry.

50:34.576 --> 50:39.714
Now, I would like you
do to a favor for me.

50:39.748 --> 50:45.654
In that safe, there's a shoebox
marked Kringle Time.

50:45.687 --> 50:47.822
I want you to take that shoebox

50:47.856 --> 50:49.824
and destroy it.

50:49.858 --> 50:53.595
Do not open it,
do not ask questions,

50:53.628 --> 50:55.597
just destroy it.

50:55.630 --> 50:57.532
I want you to burn it.

50:57.565 --> 51:00.903
Burn it till
there is nothing left.

51:00.937 --> 51:04.941
That's all I need you
to do for me.

51:04.974 --> 51:07.609
Try not to fuck up, Jerry.

51:07.642 --> 51:08.945
Love ya.

51:10.745 --> 51:11.948
Oh!

51:11.981 --> 51:14.183
Jesus. Oh!

51:44.947 --> 51:49.885
♪ Who are you
coming in so close ♪

51:49.919 --> 51:53.822
♪ So close,

51:53.855 --> 51:57.759

51:57.792 --> 52:00.129
Herb was one of
our greatest treasures.

52:00.162 --> 52:03.065
This monument will immortalize
his deeds forever.

52:43.205 --> 52:44.206
Yeah.

52:50.079 --> 52:51.247
It's not nothing,
what am I saying?

52:51.280 --> 52:52.614
- Oh, Jesus.
- All right, Jerry,

52:52.647 --> 52:54.917
calm the fuck down.

52:54.950 --> 52:56.651
Does anyone else know
about this?

52:58.988 --> 53:05.027
Okay, so we have a choice.

53:05.061 --> 53:09.231
Now, once we open that box,
we may not have a choice.

53:09.265 --> 53:11.167
This is one of those

53:11.200 --> 53:14.003
Pandora's Cat
kind of situations, Jerry.

53:15.770 --> 53:16.871
I mean, I understand
what you're saying.

53:16.906 --> 53:17.872
I don't think that's
the correct phrase, but...

53:17.907 --> 53:19.909
Okay, okay, okay,
think about it like this.

53:19.942 --> 53:21.676
Herb's dead!

53:21.709 --> 53:24.779
If anything was going on,
it's over!

53:24.813 --> 53:28.250
Whatever is in that box,

53:28.284 --> 53:31.020
what good would it do
to see the light of day?

53:31.053 --> 53:32.922
I don't know, I just...

53:33.889 --> 53:35.091
Listen to me.

53:35.124 --> 53:37.692
We brought Kringles back
from the dead!

53:37.725 --> 53:40.262
Do you want to kill him again?

53:40.296 --> 53:42.098
You open that box,
and I promise you,

53:42.131 --> 53:43.999
you will bring the show down.

53:44.033 --> 53:47.635
And if the show goes down,
I go down.

53:47.669 --> 53:48.803
Do you want that?

53:51.673 --> 53:53.708
Okay, okay.

53:53.741 --> 53:56.112
Think about it like this,
all right?

53:56.145 --> 53:57.046
No!

54:01.250 --> 54:02.918
Mark! Get me fire!

54:04.719 --> 54:06.788
- Daphne, come on!
- No!

54:06.821 --> 54:08.057
Just let it go!

54:11.327 --> 54:12.827
Gimme the goddamn box.

54:18.234 --> 54:20.002
Just let it happen, Jerry!

54:24.806 --> 54:27.243
No! No!

54:29.345 --> 54:30.346
I'm gonna throw up.

54:30.379 --> 54:31.347
Oh, God, no!

54:31.380 --> 54:33.681
No! God!

54:33.715 --> 54:34.682
Fine!

54:34.716 --> 54:37.319
Fine, take the box!

54:37.353 --> 54:39.388
Oh, God, thank you.

54:39.421 --> 54:41.123
No!

54:41.157 --> 54:42.258
Ow!

54:42.291 --> 54:43.758
No!

54:46.061 --> 54:47.963
God!

54:47.997 --> 54:49.265
Fuck!

54:54.470 --> 54:56.038
She's so strong.

54:56.071 --> 54:58.073
Why is she so strong?
She's a freak.

55:14.990 --> 55:16.724
- Jerry.
- No!

55:16.758 --> 55:18.127
Damn it! Jerry!

55:18.160 --> 55:19.827
Just hear me out! Hear me out.

55:31.207 --> 55:32.208
Look.

55:34.143 --> 55:36.912
I've been talking to the board
about giving you

55:36.946 --> 55:38.480
creative control
of Kringle Time.

55:42.551 --> 55:45.921
They think you've done
a hell of a job, Jerry.

55:45.955 --> 55:50.192
I mean, I think you've done
a hell of a job.

55:50.226 --> 55:51.961
And the audience,

55:51.994 --> 55:54.430
they love you!

55:54.463 --> 55:56.899
We could ride this wave, Jerry.

55:56.932 --> 55:58.467
I mean, Herb, he was content
to be a big fish

55:58.500 --> 56:00.002
in a small toilet,
but you and I?

56:01.170 --> 56:03.405
We think big.

56:03.439 --> 56:05.374
We don't have to be stuck
at Public Access

56:05.407 --> 56:07.476
the rest of our lives.

56:07.509 --> 56:13.048
Kringles could be on
local affiliate stations, Jerry.

56:13.082 --> 56:14.450
How does that sound?

56:21.023 --> 56:26.228
If you want it,
the show is yours.

56:26.262 --> 56:28.097
Thank you all for coming.

56:28.130 --> 56:30.532
You know, when Herb
first gave me this task,

56:30.566 --> 56:33.535
to build this monument
in his honor,

56:33.569 --> 56:35.537
I felt unworthy.

56:35.571 --> 56:37.940
How could I, a humble mayor,

56:37.973 --> 56:40.509
two-time all-state
varsity swimming champion,

56:40.542 --> 56:42.144
and veteran,

56:42.177 --> 56:45.180
do justice to this great man?

56:45.214 --> 56:49.018
But with all your support,
we made this happen.

56:49.051 --> 56:50.219
Thank you.

56:55.624 --> 56:56.824
I want to thank Fabio.

56:56.858 --> 56:58.060
Where's Fabio?

56:58.093 --> 56:59.528
Thank you for all
your late nights

56:59.561 --> 57:01.497
on this project.

57:01.530 --> 57:03.966
Love the ascot.

57:03.999 --> 57:06.834
And thank you all
for entrusting me

57:06.868 --> 57:09.305
with this sacred task.

57:09.338 --> 57:12.241
And I want to say,

57:12.274 --> 57:14.310
without exaggeration,

57:14.343 --> 57:17.112
that when I stand here
tomorrow morning

57:17.146 --> 57:18.914
and watch the sun crest
over the shoulders

57:18.947 --> 57:21.016
of this great man,

57:21.050 --> 57:25.954
it'll be the greatest moment
of my life.

57:25.988 --> 57:27.890
- You know, when I...
- I'll be right back.

57:27.923 --> 57:29.258
...was a young boy,
I visited the...

57:29.291 --> 57:30.893
Heather!

57:30.926 --> 57:32.227
Sorry, um...

57:33.896 --> 57:35.331
- Why did you leave?
- I have to get to work.

57:35.364 --> 57:38.567
No, um, why did you
leave the show?

57:38.600 --> 57:40.469
Don't act like you don't know.

57:40.502 --> 57:41.904
I... I don't.

57:41.937 --> 57:44.406
You were the one
who sent me to Kringle Time.

57:44.440 --> 57:47.009
What... what do you mean?

57:47.042 --> 57:49.278
You were an intern for the show.

57:49.311 --> 57:51.580
- Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
- Thank you, thank you, thanks.

57:51.613 --> 57:53.515
I'd also like
to take this opportunity

57:53.549 --> 57:55.384
to announce
the new creative director

57:55.417 --> 57:56.385
of Kringle Time...

57:56.418 --> 57:57.953
Mr. Jericho Perkins!

58:01.290 --> 58:03.592
Here's to many more, Jerry!

58:03.625 --> 58:06.228
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

58:06.261 --> 58:07.596
- Truly.
- Thank you, thank you.

01:00:01.243 --> 01:00:02.644
You wanna get drunk?

01:00:02.678 --> 01:00:05.047
- I hated her!
- No, you didn't!

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:06.181
You had the biggest crush
on her.

01:00:06.215 --> 01:00:08.283
No, I didn't, she was dating...

01:00:08.317 --> 01:00:10.185
she was dating that dude Ross.

01:00:10.219 --> 01:00:11.153
She was dating that dude Ross,

01:00:11.186 --> 01:00:13.322
I swear to God
that dude couldn't count.

01:00:13.355 --> 01:00:14.389
He couldn't count numbers.

01:00:14.423 --> 01:00:16.358
Oh, Ross, yeah.

01:00:16.391 --> 01:00:18.393
He was a dick, though,
I would have dated her.

01:00:19.761 --> 01:00:22.264
No, it was...
it was Mrs. Clarkson,

01:00:22.297 --> 01:00:23.565
she was math?

01:00:23.599 --> 01:00:25.167
- Was she math?
- No.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.468
- Yes, she was math!
- I don't think so.

01:00:26.502 --> 01:00:29.705
Yes, because Dad
had the hots for her!

01:00:29.738 --> 01:00:31.039
- Did not know that.
- Yes,

01:00:31.073 --> 01:00:33.542
Dad wanted to do dick
stuff to her.

01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:36.678
Fucking Dad.

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.215
You've got the cutest face.

01:00:41.416 --> 01:00:43.218
Where did you get that face?

01:00:43.252 --> 01:00:44.720
- I don't know.
- You're so cute.

01:00:44.753 --> 01:00:46.822
Jerry!

01:00:46.855 --> 01:00:48.590
What are you doing?

01:00:48.624 --> 01:00:50.592
Stop it.

01:00:54.096 --> 01:00:55.430
Jerry?

01:00:58.333 --> 01:01:02.804
I feel like you want me to be
something different...

01:01:02.838 --> 01:01:04.773
than who I am.

01:01:09.444 --> 01:01:11.580
So handsome.

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:21.623
I am not gonna
remember this tomorrow.

01:01:23.825 --> 01:01:25.827
I wonder if it even happened.

01:02:44.306 --> 01:02:45.641
Where are you?

01:02:47.542 --> 01:02:48.877
Where are you!

01:02:50.679 --> 01:02:52.814
Where are you?

01:02:52.848 --> 01:02:54.884
I wanna talk to you!

01:02:55.751 --> 01:03:00.322
Hello, Jerry.

01:03:05.694 --> 01:03:07.429
Show me Herb.

01:03:08.998 --> 01:03:12.634
You're the all-powerful
fuckin' demon thingy.

01:03:14.536 --> 01:03:17.506
Show me Herb's face.

01:03:17.539 --> 01:03:20.308
I wanna look him
in the fucking eyes.

01:03:22.778 --> 01:03:24.713
Show me, goddammit!

01:03:36.258 --> 01:03:38.393
Hiya, Jer.

01:03:43.365 --> 01:03:45.333
What the fuck is wrong
with you, man?

01:03:45.367 --> 01:03:46.936
Hey, hey, settle down!

01:03:46.969 --> 01:03:48.670
I didn't kill anybody.

01:03:48.704 --> 01:03:50.439
Well, that's
a low fuckin' bar, Herb.

01:03:50.472 --> 01:03:51.673
Come on, man.

01:03:51.707 --> 01:03:53.475
I've done nothing illegal.

01:03:53.508 --> 01:03:54.843
You took advantage
of those kids!

01:03:54.876 --> 01:03:56.611
They weren't kids!

01:03:56.645 --> 01:04:00.816
They're teenagers, we're talking
about goddamn teenagers.

01:04:00.849 --> 01:04:04.252
And I asked every one of them

01:04:04.286 --> 01:04:07.589
if they would do it,
and none of them said no.

01:04:07.622 --> 01:04:09.992
You were fucking Kringles, man,
they're not gonna say no to you!

01:04:10.026 --> 01:04:11.626
Yeah, well,
they were fine with it.

01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.662
They don't look
fucking fine, Herb!

01:04:13.695 --> 01:04:14.730
You know what?

01:04:14.763 --> 01:04:16.465
I'm fucking sick of this!

01:04:16.498 --> 01:04:19.835
You drag me back
from beyond the grave,

01:04:19.868 --> 01:04:22.671
and after everything...

01:04:22.704 --> 01:04:27.043
everything
that I've done for you.

01:04:29.979 --> 01:04:32.614
After everything
you've done for me?

01:04:32.647 --> 01:04:34.616
You never gave a shit about me.

01:04:34.649 --> 01:04:35.985
Even when you gave me
my dream job,

01:04:36.018 --> 01:04:37.519
you fucking poisoned it.

01:04:37.552 --> 01:04:38.620
The only reason I'm here

01:04:38.653 --> 01:04:40.789
is 'cause you knew
I'd do your dirty work for you.

01:04:40.822 --> 01:04:42.424
What have you given me, huh?

01:04:42.457 --> 01:04:44.359
Besides dangle a fucking carrot
in front of me for 20 years?

01:04:44.392 --> 01:04:47.596
Oh, wah, wah, poor little boy!

01:04:47.629 --> 01:04:50.632
Make a life for yourself, Jerry.

01:04:50.665 --> 01:04:53.568
You could have left at any time,
but you didn't.

01:04:53.602 --> 01:04:55.637
Why?

01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:57.839
Because your dreams
weren't big enough,

01:04:57.873 --> 01:04:59.708
and you knew it.

01:04:59.741 --> 01:05:00.809
This is all beside the point.

01:05:00.842 --> 01:05:02.778
You had a responsibility
to those kids,

01:05:02.811 --> 01:05:04.080
and you fucking betrayed us.

01:05:04.113 --> 01:05:05.781
Yeah, well don't pretend
you didn't know

01:05:05.814 --> 01:05:07.783
- what was happening.
- I didn't know!

01:05:07.816 --> 01:05:10.052
All that line of interns
that quit

01:05:10.086 --> 01:05:13.755
after going into Kringle Time
with me?

01:05:17.894 --> 01:05:19.061
You knew what was going on.

01:05:19.095 --> 01:05:21.630
You just chose to ignore it.

01:05:21.663 --> 01:05:24.699
That makes you as guilty as me.

01:05:24.733 --> 01:05:27.369
I 100% never lassoed
an intern, Herb.

01:05:27.402 --> 01:05:30.006
"I never lassoed an intern."

01:05:30.039 --> 01:05:32.307
You wanna do something about it?

01:05:33.408 --> 01:05:35.844
I'm ashes.

01:05:35.877 --> 01:05:37.412
I don't care.

01:05:37.445 --> 01:05:38.948
Huh?

01:05:51.526 --> 01:05:54.897
Oh, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.

01:06:57.492 --> 01:06:59.861
You didn't answer me.

01:06:59.896 --> 01:07:02.631
What are you going to do?

01:07:05.167 --> 01:07:08.436
I'm gonna tear
this whole fucking place down.

01:07:14.576 --> 01:07:18.613

01:07:18.647 --> 01:07:22.651

01:08:12.767 --> 01:08:14.003
Pow-pow!

01:08:28.616 --> 01:08:30.518

you get tingles.

01:08:53.975 --> 01:08:57.313
Jerry, why aren't you
in costume, dude?

01:08:57.345 --> 01:08:58.779
It's in the dressing room.

01:08:58.813 --> 01:09:00.749
All right.

01:09:00.782 --> 01:09:02.817
I wanted to ask you, um,

01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:05.553
right here actually,
there it is.

01:09:05.587 --> 01:09:08.157
What's this "Kringle Surprise"
thing?

01:09:08.189 --> 01:09:09.892
Don't worry about that.

01:09:09.925 --> 01:09:11.227
What is it?

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:12.660
Don't worry about it.

01:09:12.694 --> 01:09:14.029
Like, I'm not worrying about it,

01:09:14.063 --> 01:09:15.231
I just want to know what it is.

01:09:15.264 --> 01:09:16.232
It's a surprise.

01:09:16.265 --> 01:09:18.134
Don't worry about it.

01:09:18.167 --> 01:09:21.103
See, now I'm... now I'm starting
to worry about it.

01:09:21.136 --> 01:09:23.305
It's just a surprise.

01:09:23.339 --> 01:09:24.872
Don't worry about it.

01:09:26.808 --> 01:09:28.010
Okay.

01:10:13.089 --> 01:10:16.092
You sure you want
to do this, Jerry?

01:10:16.125 --> 01:10:17.792
Yes, Dad.

01:10:17.826 --> 01:10:19.361
I'm sure.

01:10:19.395 --> 01:10:21.931
What about the kids?

01:10:23.698 --> 01:10:25.968
I'm doing this for the kids.

01:10:26.001 --> 01:10:30.039
Uh, are you, Jerry?

01:10:30.072 --> 01:10:33.409
Because if you open up
that box on air,

01:10:33.442 --> 01:10:36.245
you are gonna traumatize
the shit out of them.

01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:42.318
Yeah, well, they gotta grow up
sometime, right?

01:10:42.351 --> 01:10:43.785
I did.

01:10:43.818 --> 01:10:45.354
You made sure of that
pretty goddamn early,

01:10:45.387 --> 01:10:46.155
both of you.

01:10:46.188 --> 01:10:48.090
I was just protecting you,
buddy.

01:10:48.124 --> 01:10:49.992
I didn't need protecting.

01:10:52.394 --> 01:10:54.163
I'm taking the blinders off.

01:12:12.274 --> 01:12:14.376
Scrip-a-doo-banana-jamma!

01:12:14.410 --> 01:12:16.744
Scrip-a-doo-banana-jamma!

01:12:32.328 --> 01:12:34.063
No, no.

01:12:35.998 --> 01:12:37.066
No!

01:12:37.099 --> 01:12:38.167
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.168
Goddammit!

01:12:42.004 --> 01:12:43.472
I'm an opportunist, Jer.

01:12:43.505 --> 01:12:45.873
What'd you expect?

01:12:58.354 --> 01:13:01.490
Look, don't feel too bad.

01:13:01.523 --> 01:13:04.059
If I had a nickel for every time
someone found me passed out

01:13:04.093 --> 01:13:06.428
in front of
incriminating evidence...

01:13:10.832 --> 01:13:13.569
Look, Jerry, you can't
make change from the bottom.

01:13:13.602 --> 01:13:15.870
Power doesn't trickle up.

01:13:15.904 --> 01:13:17.506
You want real change,
you know what has to happen?

01:13:17.539 --> 01:13:19.441
The person at the top
has to give up control,

01:13:19.475 --> 01:13:21.343
and people don't do that.

01:13:22.945 --> 01:13:26.315
Think of it as a new beginning.

01:13:47.936 --> 01:13:51.373
Yeah, so I missed the deposit
for the one in Brooklyn,

01:13:51.407 --> 01:13:55.044
but I did find this one
in Queens

01:13:55.077 --> 01:13:57.845
that I could move into
by early October-ish,

01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:01.250
but I don't know, like,
is that too early?

01:14:01.283 --> 01:14:03.319
Like early October-ish?

01:14:03.352 --> 01:14:04.453
What the fuck?

01:14:04.486 --> 01:14:06.088
Gunther!

01:14:06.121 --> 01:14:08.557
Why hasn't my fucking trash
been taken out?

01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:10.392
- Fünf minuten...
- No! No!

01:14:10.426 --> 01:14:13.228
Not fünf minuten. Right now!

01:14:13.262 --> 01:14:15.998
All you have to do
is keep this place clean!

01:14:16.031 --> 01:14:18.233
You have one fucking job.

01:14:18.267 --> 01:14:19.902
I want this trash cleaned up.

01:14:19.935 --> 01:14:23.572
Not tomorrow, not next week,
not "fünf minutens,"

01:14:23.605 --> 01:14:25.074
right now!

01:14:25.107 --> 01:14:27.409
Or you're fucking fired!

01:14:27.443 --> 01:14:29.011
Hey, Jer-Bear!

01:14:29.044 --> 01:14:30.045
Calm down, huh?

01:14:30.079 --> 01:14:32.514
My name is Jerry, goddammit.

01:14:32.548 --> 01:14:34.516
And the next person
to call me "Jer-Bear"

01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:36.285
is fucking fired, too!

01:14:36.318 --> 01:14:37.920
Yeah, you're just
gonna fire everybody, huh,

01:14:37.953 --> 01:14:40.122
big Mister fuckin'
Boss Man or whatever?

01:14:40.155 --> 01:14:43.525
Shut the fuck up, Naveed!

01:14:43.559 --> 01:14:48.364
Oh, and by the way,
you're never moving to Brooklyn.

01:14:48.397 --> 01:14:49.932
What?

01:14:49.965 --> 01:14:51.367
How long you been
talking about that, huh?

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.401
Four years?

01:14:52.434 --> 01:14:53.502
Five years?

01:14:53.535 --> 01:14:56.071
Yeah, it just hasn't been
the right time yet.

01:14:57.406 --> 01:14:58.440
It's not the right time?

01:14:58.474 --> 01:15:00.008
Yeah, it's never the right time.

01:15:00.042 --> 01:15:01.143
That's not the question.

01:15:01.176 --> 01:15:04.179
The question is are you
the kind of person who goes,

01:15:04.213 --> 01:15:05.948
or the kind of person
who stays?

01:15:05.981 --> 01:15:06.849
Hm.

01:15:06.882 --> 01:15:09.017
You're the kind of person
who stays.

01:15:09.051 --> 01:15:10.185
Okay?

01:15:10.219 --> 01:15:12.388
And take my advice,
realize that now.

01:15:12.421 --> 01:15:14.957
It'll be less of a fall.

01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:18.160
Shitty, Jerry. Very shitty.

01:15:18.193 --> 01:15:19.928
This is why we never wanted
to hang out with you.

01:15:19.962 --> 01:15:21.597
I don't give a shit!

01:15:21.630 --> 01:15:24.266
'Cause you're all
a big basket of assholes!

01:15:24.299 --> 01:15:25.434
And it's about time
you showed me

01:15:25.467 --> 01:15:27.369
some fucking respect!

01:15:51.593 --> 01:15:55.964
1992, that season,
now everybody likes that season.

01:15:55.998 --> 01:15:59.435
Tell you the truth, Ernie,
total blur.

01:15:59.468 --> 01:16:02.070
I don't remember much
about it at all.

01:16:02.104 --> 01:16:05.474
You know,
I knew Jamie Farr back then.

01:16:05.507 --> 01:16:07.743
- Introduced him to cocaine.
- Wow.

01:16:07.776 --> 01:16:10.212
He introduced
Robert Downey, Jr. to coke

01:16:10.245 --> 01:16:11.680
and then we had a foursome!

01:16:11.713 --> 01:16:13.382
So!

01:16:13.415 --> 01:16:14.550
When are we going on air?

01:16:14.583 --> 01:16:16.552
We're live now.

01:16:16.585 --> 01:16:18.020
Shit.

01:16:27.162 --> 01:16:30.165
So this season,
there's a Kringles show.

01:16:30.199 --> 01:16:34.470
Oh, yeah, we've got a singing,
dancing snowman, yeah.

01:16:34.503 --> 01:16:36.004
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, for sure.

01:16:36.038 --> 01:16:37.606
Yeah. Anything else?

01:16:37.639 --> 01:16:39.007
Anything else
we can expect to...

01:16:39.041 --> 01:16:40.075
No, no.

01:16:40.108 --> 01:16:41.577
Oh, great, no, far out, far out.

01:16:41.610 --> 01:16:43.412
You know, I love...

01:16:49.451 --> 01:16:50.352
Whee!

01:16:54.756 --> 01:16:57.593
Welcome back
to Good Morning, Goshen!

01:16:57.626 --> 01:16:59.361
We're here with Herbert Kelley.

01:16:59.394 --> 01:17:00.429
Hi, Herb, how's it going?

01:17:00.462 --> 01:17:01.763
- Very good.
- Oh, good, good,

01:17:01.797 --> 01:17:03.398
that's good to hear, yeah, yeah.

01:17:03.432 --> 01:17:05.300
So you were talking a little bit
about Kringle Time.

01:17:05.334 --> 01:17:07.369
- Tell us a little bit more.
- It's a different kind of show

01:17:07.402 --> 01:17:09.238
from what people
are prepared for.

01:17:09.271 --> 01:17:10.339
Different kind of show.

01:17:10.372 --> 01:17:12.040
How's that?

01:17:12.074 --> 01:17:14.309
I think kids are smart.

01:17:14.343 --> 01:17:15.744
And I believe that
the worst thing that we can do

01:17:15.777 --> 01:17:18.580
as adults is to pretend
that life's not hard.

01:17:18.614 --> 01:17:20.749
I mean, the world's
a hard place,

01:17:20.782 --> 01:17:24.186
and it's a confusing place,
but...

01:17:24.219 --> 01:17:27.389
there's a beauty
in that confusion.

01:17:27.422 --> 01:17:30.092
If there's a guiding principle
behind Kringle Time...

01:17:32.194 --> 01:17:34.229
...it's about being honest
about who you are

01:17:34.263 --> 01:17:35.564
and what you want to do.

01:17:35.597 --> 01:17:37.132
Because if Kringles exists

01:17:37.165 --> 01:17:40.168
at the expense
of being genuine, then,

01:17:40.202 --> 01:17:41.236
well, maybe there comes a time

01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:45.140
when the world doesn't need
Kringles anymore.

01:17:59.321 --> 01:18:00.656
Gunther!

01:18:00.689 --> 01:18:02.691
Jesus.

01:18:02.724 --> 01:18:05.460
Gunther, where's my trash?

01:18:05.494 --> 01:18:08.130
I took it out, like you asked.

01:18:08.163 --> 01:18:09.431
- Am I fired?
- No!

01:18:09.464 --> 01:18:11.867
No, I'm sorry, Gunther, man,
I was a dick.

01:18:11.901 --> 01:18:16.104
Look, is there any way I can
still get a hold of that trash?

01:18:28.684 --> 01:18:30.319
Ah!

01:18:36.458 --> 01:18:38.360
Ew, gross, Jerry!

01:18:38.393 --> 01:18:40.395
All right, listen up, fuckers.

01:18:40.429 --> 01:18:42.497
I'm the creative director
of Kringle Time.

01:18:42.531 --> 01:18:44.800
And guess what?

01:18:44.833 --> 01:18:47.169
We got some changes
we're gonna make.

01:19:23.372 --> 01:19:25.641
Kringles.

01:19:25.674 --> 01:19:28.443
I brought you this mouse,

01:19:28.477 --> 01:19:31.546
but it died in my hands.

01:19:34.850 --> 01:19:36.251
This mouse...

01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:40.689
...is my father.

01:19:45.661 --> 01:19:46.896
Kringles!

01:19:47.763 --> 01:19:49.966
Jessica.

01:19:49.999 --> 01:19:51.733
I'm pregnant!

01:19:54.269 --> 01:19:55.570
What?

01:19:55.604 --> 01:19:57.239
I'm pregnant!

01:19:58.807 --> 01:19:59.875
What?

01:19:59.909 --> 01:20:02.344
I'm pregnant!

01:20:02.377 --> 01:20:03.712
Oh.

01:20:03.745 --> 01:20:05.714
What?

01:20:08.017 --> 01:20:09.618
Oh, no!

01:20:09.651 --> 01:20:11.420
Ken Starr!

01:20:11.453 --> 01:20:13.755
I'm gonna get ya!

01:20:17.292 --> 01:20:18.627
Come on, kids!

01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:22.932
Let's play a game
of hide and no-seek!

01:20:36.445 --> 01:20:37.746
Mr. Mayor, I'm sorry,

01:20:37.779 --> 01:20:39.247
I've got other things
to deal with.

01:20:39.281 --> 01:20:40.282
Okey-dokey, I gotcha,

01:20:40.315 --> 01:20:42.651
but if we could just circle back
about the statue...

01:20:42.684 --> 01:20:43.819
Anita?

01:20:43.852 --> 01:20:44.786
Yeah?

01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:46.688
Can you show the mayor
the traffic cameras

01:20:46.722 --> 01:20:48.490
at 1st and Samson?

01:20:48.523 --> 01:20:50.927
Yeah.

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:52.828
Thank you.

01:20:55.597 --> 01:20:57.934
I really appreciate this, Anita.

01:20:57.967 --> 01:21:00.036
It's been a tough few days.

01:21:00.069 --> 01:21:02.304
Yeah.

01:21:04.907 --> 01:21:06.508
Oh, there!

01:21:06.541 --> 01:21:07.709
Can you zoom in?

01:21:07.743 --> 01:21:08.844
Yeah.

01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:13.682
Is that Jerry?

01:21:13.715 --> 01:21:16.518
Yeah.

01:21:16.551 --> 01:21:17.853
What is he doing?

01:21:30.967 --> 01:21:31.867
Where'd he go?

01:21:37.106 --> 01:21:38.373
Jerry.

01:21:39.909 --> 01:21:41.343

after a word from our sponsors.

01:22:21.951 --> 01:22:23.652
And we're out.

01:22:23.685 --> 01:22:24.921
Yeah.

01:22:26.655 --> 01:22:28.124
That was incredible!

01:22:28.157 --> 01:22:29.025
Really great stuff.

01:22:29.058 --> 01:22:32.627
What in the ever-living fuck
was that?

01:22:32.661 --> 01:22:34.030
You gave me creative control.

01:22:34.063 --> 01:22:36.765
And I told you to color
inside the fucking lines,

01:22:36.798 --> 01:22:38.533
Jerry, I told you!

01:22:38.567 --> 01:22:39.401
If you keep going like this,

01:22:39.434 --> 01:22:40.669
you are going to kill
Kringle Time...

01:22:40.702 --> 01:22:42.604
is that what you want?

01:22:45.174 --> 01:22:46.943
Oh, Jesus Lord, of course.

01:22:46.976 --> 01:22:48.643
Why didn't I realize it before?

01:22:48.677 --> 01:22:50.545
You're just enough
of a fucking psychopath

01:22:50.579 --> 01:22:52.949
- to tank your own show!
- Wait, what?

01:22:52.982 --> 01:22:54.951
- You didn't approve this?
- Who's Ken Starr?

01:22:54.984 --> 01:22:57.019
Fuck no, you idiots!

01:22:57.053 --> 01:23:00.522
- Liar, Jerry, very liar!
- What the hell, Jerry?

01:23:00.555 --> 01:23:02.058
- The show must go on.
- Wow.

01:23:02.091 --> 01:23:03.425
You are right about that.

01:23:03.458 --> 01:23:04.492
Get him out of this suit.

01:23:04.526 --> 01:23:06.162
Mark, you are up.

01:23:06.195 --> 01:23:07.997
Sorry about this, Jerry...

01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:09.932
- No!
- Give me the glove!

01:23:09.966 --> 01:23:11.901
- You guys like wrestling?
- Mark!

01:23:13.869 --> 01:23:15.104
- Get up!
- Get up, Jerry.

01:23:18.074 --> 01:23:19.708
A, B, C, D...

01:23:21.576 --> 01:23:23.879
You can't do this.

01:23:23.913 --> 01:23:26.916
I can do anything I want, Jerry.

01:23:26.949 --> 01:23:30.518
I'm the executive director
of Goshen Public Access.

01:23:32.754 --> 01:23:34.924
Sorry, Jer. Love you, buddy.

01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:42.464
No!

01:23:46.501 --> 01:23:48.637
Can we have more time?
I don't have a mic!

01:23:48.670 --> 01:23:49.906
How are we gonna...

01:23:49.939 --> 01:23:51.073
- Four...
- Just make it look happy!

01:23:51.107 --> 01:23:52.641
...three...

01:23:55.610 --> 01:23:57.812
Hey, kids!

01:23:57.846 --> 01:23:59.781
Come on now, Jerry, come on.

01:24:02.985 --> 01:24:04.921
It's done, Jerry.

01:24:04.954 --> 01:24:07.089
Your Kringle Time
has come to an end.

01:24:08.857 --> 01:24:13.062
You will be nothing
but a blip in history.

01:24:13.095 --> 01:24:15.998
Like George Lazenby.

01:24:16.032 --> 01:24:17.199
Motherfucker.

01:24:17.233 --> 01:24:19.068
What I learned
from the afterlife

01:24:19.101 --> 01:24:22.504
is there's
no such thing as sadness!

01:24:22.537 --> 01:24:24.040
- Uh, yes!
- Oh, goddammit.

01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:33.615
Why did you take
your blinders off?

01:24:33.648 --> 01:24:35.650
All of it could have been yours.

01:24:37.619 --> 01:24:40.222
You can't kill a symbol.

01:24:40.256 --> 01:24:43.059
You try to break the symbol,

01:24:43.092 --> 01:24:46.628
the symbol breaks you.

01:24:52.734 --> 01:24:57.706
You know,
it's funny you say that.

01:24:57.739 --> 01:25:00.076
Because really,

01:25:00.109 --> 01:25:02.278
anything will kill a snowman.

01:25:03.913 --> 01:25:06.815
Literally just existing
long enough

01:25:06.848 --> 01:25:09.285
will kill a snowman.

01:25:09.318 --> 01:25:15.024
We only build snowmen
to slowly watch them die.

01:25:15.057 --> 01:25:16.858
What does that say about us?

01:25:20.762 --> 01:25:22.564
But you know,

01:25:22.597 --> 01:25:24.766
the quickest way
to kill a snowman?

01:25:35.277 --> 01:25:37.313
Fire.

01:25:37.346 --> 01:25:41.183
If you do it, they'll hate you.

01:25:49.858 --> 01:25:52.560
Kringle Twist!

01:25:59.902 --> 01:26:01.103
Fire alarms?

01:26:01.137 --> 01:26:02.704
Since when are those...

01:26:02.737 --> 01:26:03.805
Fire!

01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:08.843
♪ The fire's only
in your imagination ♪

01:26:08.877 --> 01:26:10.678
Come on, everyone,
let's go, there's a fire!

01:26:10.712 --> 01:26:11.846
Apparently.

01:26:11.881 --> 01:26:13.249
Gunther, it's a big fire,
that's not gonna work!

01:26:13.282 --> 01:26:15.017
You gotta go, come on!

01:26:15.051 --> 01:26:17.053

yeah, let's go!

01:26:17.086 --> 01:26:19.221
Come on, here we go,
let's go to safety!

Mark, Mark, Mark!

01:26:20.655 --> 01:26:22.590
Hey, listen, you gotta
take the suit off, man.

01:26:22.624 --> 01:26:23.758
Hey, you're not gonna make it!

01:26:23.792 --> 01:26:25.327
- Are you an angel?
- Mark!

01:26:25.361 --> 01:26:28.130
Take the suit off,
I'll protect the suit!

01:26:37.106 --> 01:26:40.708
Jerry! You son of a bitch!

01:26:40.742 --> 01:26:42.877
- Jerry!
- What are you doing?

01:26:42.912 --> 01:26:44.779
- There's a fire in there!
- Jerry!

01:26:44.813 --> 01:26:47.682
Jerry, you let me
back in there right now.

01:26:47.715 --> 01:26:48.616
What the fuck?

01:26:48.650 --> 01:26:49.684
Fire in there, Jerry!

01:26:49.717 --> 01:26:52.754
What the... what the fuck?

01:26:54.223 --> 01:26:56.892
911, what's your emergency?

01:26:56.926 --> 01:26:57.893
Ernest.

01:26:57.927 --> 01:26:59.828
Ernest.

01:26:59.861 --> 01:27:01.063
No, no, Ernest, Ernest,
wait, wait.

01:27:01.097 --> 01:27:02.864
Undo this rope, Ernest!

01:27:02.898 --> 01:27:05.000
Just hear me out, okay?

01:27:05.034 --> 01:27:07.702
Look, you love
doing your show, right?

01:27:07.735 --> 01:27:08.703
Every week, I let you
go out there

01:27:08.736 --> 01:27:09.737
and do whatever you want.

01:27:09.771 --> 01:27:11.107
That's what this station's
about, right?

01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:13.142
Do not listen
to that motherfucker!

01:27:13.175 --> 01:27:14.176
That's all I want.

01:27:14.210 --> 01:27:15.911
I just want five minutes, Ern.

01:27:15.945 --> 01:27:18.080
Can you help me do that, please?

01:27:18.114 --> 01:27:20.082
There is no fire in there!

01:27:22.284 --> 01:27:23.919
What do you say, buddy?

01:27:31.227 --> 01:27:32.428
- You fucking idiot.
- Oh, fuck, you're right.

01:27:32.461 --> 01:27:34.796

01:27:34.829 --> 01:27:38.300

Kringles Korner, huh?

01:28:44.233 --> 01:28:46.868

01:28:48.504 --> 01:28:51.273
Jerry!

01:28:51.307 --> 01:28:53.909
Oh, look, it's
a credit card statement!

01:28:53.943 --> 01:28:55.511
Yay!

01:28:55.544 --> 01:28:59.048
Oh, look, this one's

01:28:59.081 --> 01:29:00.748

01:29:03.118 --> 01:29:04.920
Jerry.

01:29:11.894 --> 01:29:16.031
Kringles has had
a rough week, kids.

01:29:16.065 --> 01:29:18.100
Going through some stuff.

01:29:19.834 --> 01:29:21.370
Might sound boring
to some of you,

01:29:21.403 --> 01:29:23.105
I'm not sure, but...

01:29:23.138 --> 01:29:24.772
I guess if it comes down
to a choice

01:29:24.806 --> 01:29:27.009
between connecting
with one person

01:29:27.042 --> 01:29:31.380
versus guessing what
a bunch of people might want,

01:29:31.413 --> 01:29:35.117
I figure it's better to go
for the audience of one.

01:29:50.065 --> 01:29:52.368
My name is Jerry,

01:29:52.401 --> 01:29:55.070
and I play Kringles.

01:29:58.374 --> 01:30:01.543
Before me, it was a guy
named Herb, and, uh,

01:30:01.577 --> 01:30:05.047
Herb was a difficult man.

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:08.217
And to be honest, I hated him.

01:30:10.286 --> 01:30:12.354
But when he put on this mask...

01:30:16.492 --> 01:30:19.395
...he became something
that I loved.

01:30:24.967 --> 01:30:27.002
So what do you do with that?

01:30:29.071 --> 01:30:33.342
Do you look behind the mask
at the real person?

01:30:33.375 --> 01:30:35.277
I think that's our instinct,
right?

01:30:35.311 --> 01:30:40.082
The mask is a facade,
but the person is real.

01:30:40.115 --> 01:30:44.420
But the person is just a person.

01:30:44.453 --> 01:30:48.123
And people die. Every day.

01:30:48.157 --> 01:30:50.959
We lose good people,
we lose bad people.

01:30:53.362 --> 01:30:56.864
Eventually, we lose everybody.

01:30:56.899 --> 01:31:00.169
But the mask lives on.

01:31:00.202 --> 01:31:03.072
The mask has power forever.

01:31:05.974 --> 01:31:08.077
So which one's more important?

01:31:11.914 --> 01:31:13.282
I don't know
the answer here, kids,

01:31:13.315 --> 01:31:17.186
I'm still trying
to figure it out myself.

01:31:17.219 --> 01:31:20.055
Kringles gets lost
sometimes, too.

01:31:25.227 --> 01:31:26.362
Here's the thing, kids...

01:31:28.097 --> 01:31:29.331
...you can't choose who you are.

01:31:29.365 --> 01:31:30.566
The mayor!

01:31:30.599 --> 01:31:32.935
But you can choose
who you want to be.

01:31:32.968 --> 01:31:34.236
And personally...

01:31:34.269 --> 01:31:36.105
Jerry!

01:31:36.138 --> 01:31:38.440
...I'd like to be something
different than I have been.

01:31:39.575 --> 01:31:43.145
Naveed, I'm sorry, man.

01:31:43.178 --> 01:31:45.681
I think you will move
to Brooklyn.

01:31:45.714 --> 01:31:49.451
Gunther, I'm sorry
I never read your pilot.

01:31:49.485 --> 01:31:51.186
I just...

01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:53.188
Shit.

01:31:54.156 --> 01:31:57.159
Heather,

01:31:57.192 --> 01:31:59.495
and all the other interns...

01:32:01.597 --> 01:32:03.332
I'm sorry.

01:32:05.234 --> 01:32:06.435
I knew.

01:32:06.468 --> 01:32:08.704
Or at least,
I should have known.

01:32:08.737 --> 01:32:10.005
Stand back!

01:32:10.038 --> 01:32:13.609
- It was just...
- Ah!

01:32:13.642 --> 01:32:16.378
...just more comfortable
to ignore it, I guess.

01:32:18.013 --> 01:32:21.116
And Layla, you already know.

01:32:23.252 --> 01:32:26.488
Well, kids, uh,
I guess that's it.

01:32:28.690 --> 01:32:31.427
Kringles has to go home now.

01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:33.662
You have a good life, cowpokes.

01:32:35.464 --> 01:32:37.533
And if anyone needs
to hear this...

01:32:40.402 --> 01:32:43.539
...you are more than this.

01:32:43.572 --> 01:32:47.743
You are more than
the job you hold.

01:32:47.776 --> 01:32:50.746
You are more than
the town where you live.

01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:58.487
You are a shining ball
in the darkness of existence...

01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:01.190
ah!

01:33:03.192 --> 01:33:04.560
He is mine!

01:33:06.028 --> 01:33:08.230
Lemme at him!

01:33:08.263 --> 01:33:10.566
I will fire each
and every one of you!

01:33:13.402 --> 01:33:15.237
I have got this under control.

01:33:15.270 --> 01:33:16.638
Mr. Mayor, I have got this.

01:33:20.042 --> 01:33:21.777
What the fu...

01:33:21.810 --> 01:33:23.645
People were gonna point
at that statue

01:33:23.679 --> 01:33:25.581
a hundred years from now,
and say,

01:33:25.614 --> 01:33:27.382
"You know who built that, son?

01:33:27.416 --> 01:33:30.352
Mayor Rodney Jorkins
built that."

01:33:30.385 --> 01:33:32.521
- Jorkins! Jorkins!
- Freeze!

01:33:32.554 --> 01:33:33.722
Jorkins! Jorkins!

01:33:33.755 --> 01:33:35.624
Now what are they gonna say?

01:33:35.657 --> 01:33:38.026
They're gonna say nothing,
Jerry.

01:33:38.060 --> 01:33:39.628
Is that what you want?

01:33:39.661 --> 01:33:42.631
A future where people
are pointing at nothing?

01:33:42.664 --> 01:33:44.299
What is happening?

01:33:44.333 --> 01:33:45.334
Jorkins!

01:33:45.367 --> 01:33:47.269
I got this.

01:33:48.537 --> 01:33:49.505
Why?

01:33:49.538 --> 01:33:50.772
How does that feel, Jerry?

01:33:50.806 --> 01:33:52.140
Huh?

01:33:55.377 --> 01:33:58.280
Oh, I tasted...

01:34:05.087 --> 01:34:06.622
Ugh, fuck!

01:34:32.381 --> 01:34:33.549
Well...

01:34:36.184 --> 01:34:38.720
I did what you wanted.

01:34:38.754 --> 01:34:40.455
Your legacy's fine.

01:34:43.792 --> 01:34:45.794
For the moment, I guess.

01:34:45.827 --> 01:34:49.131
Until all those kids
out there grow up,

01:34:49.164 --> 01:34:53.735
get old, and die like me.

01:34:53.769 --> 01:34:57.272
Just remember,
there's only one Kringles.

01:34:59.575 --> 01:35:03.612
Aren't you, like,
immortal now or some shit?

01:35:05.614 --> 01:35:07.549
What's the point?

01:35:23.465 --> 01:35:25.667
I can go?

01:35:25.701 --> 01:35:27.502
Yeah.

01:36:08.710 --> 01:36:10.345
Good morning, Goshen!

01:36:10.379 --> 01:36:12.514
I'm Jasmine Harris,
filling in for Ernest

01:36:12.547 --> 01:36:14.583
while he's recuperating.

01:36:14.616 --> 01:36:17.486
Get well soon, Ernest!

01:36:17.519 --> 01:36:21.456
Mayor Rodney Jorkins
made history yesterday

01:36:21.490 --> 01:36:23.926
by being the first Goshen mayor

01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:26.662
- to be arrested while in office.
- Mr. Mayor, Mr. Mayor!

01:36:26.695 --> 01:36:27.629
No, not right now,
guys, please...

01:36:27.663 --> 01:36:28.965
How does it feel to be
the first mayor arrested

01:36:28.998 --> 01:36:29.999
- while in office?
- Wait, what?

01:36:30.033 --> 01:36:32.401
- First mayor what?
- To be arrested while in office.

01:36:32.434 --> 01:36:33.735
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:36:33.769 --> 01:36:35.337
That's pretty cool.

01:36:35.370 --> 01:36:38.473
Acting station manager
Daphne Jones announced

01:36:38.507 --> 01:36:40.442
after public backlash

01:36:40.475 --> 01:36:42.411
that the long-running
children's favorite,

01:36:42.444 --> 01:36:45.514
Kringle Time, will be cancelled.

01:36:45.547 --> 01:36:48.517
The show has been running
ever since 1987

01:36:48.550 --> 01:36:52.354
and was a staple
of Goshen Public Access.

01:36:52.387 --> 01:36:55.724
