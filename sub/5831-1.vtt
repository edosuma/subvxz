00:31.031 --> 00:34.262
I never really saw
the big picture before...

00:34.300 --> 00:36.029
not until today.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.768
Love can sure
spin your head around.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.540
God, where do you begin?

00:51.718 --> 00:55.176
The universe was created
fifteen billion years ago...

00:55.221 --> 00:58.987
in a tremendous burst
of pure energy.

00:59.025 --> 01:01.687
The matter spreading
from this big bang...

01:01.728 --> 01:03.923
became the galaxies.

01:03.963 --> 01:06.193
Our sun and planets
were formed...

01:06.232 --> 01:08.700
from swirling clouds
of star stuff...

01:08.735 --> 01:11.169
over five billion years ago.

01:13.173 --> 01:15.141
It took billions more years...

01:15.175 --> 01:17.143
for the first life
to be created...

01:17.177 --> 01:20.237
in the primordial stew
of earth's atmosphere.

01:21.881 --> 01:23.906
Life slowly evolved.

01:23.950 --> 01:26.145
One-celled organisms
learned to reproduce...

01:26.186 --> 01:28.518
and became more complex.

01:31.691 --> 01:35.149
At first
clinging to the ocean floor...

01:35.195 --> 01:37.993
then developing locomotion
and sight.

01:42.202 --> 01:44.670
Hundreds of millions
of years ago...

01:44.704 --> 01:47.673
our primitive ancestors
crawled up on the shore.

01:47.707 --> 01:50.175
Amphibians
gave way to reptiles...

01:50.210 --> 01:53.668
who ruled the earth
for millions of years.

01:53.713 --> 01:56.739
Then came warm-blooded mammals.

01:56.783 --> 02:01.152
Man evolved
in the last few million years.

02:01.187 --> 02:03.417
It took
tens of thousands of years...

02:03.456 --> 02:07.620
for civilization as we know it
to reach the modern era.

02:07.660 --> 02:09.184
And it took thirty years...

02:09.229 --> 02:12.164
for Harry Washello
to find the right girl.

03:08.054 --> 03:09.612
You guys better
brush your teeth...

03:09.656 --> 03:12.352
or that could be you
in ten thousand years.

03:58.204 --> 04:01.002
You guys want to put
a dollar in here?

04:01.040 --> 04:04.942
OK. Here you go.
One for each of us.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.947
Just take it and put it
in the kitty's nice little... ow!

04:09.916 --> 04:12.077
...from the ice.

04:12.118 --> 04:13.881
They cut off a piece of it...

04:13.920 --> 04:18.289
and they thawed it out,
cooked it up, and they ate it.

04:18.324 --> 04:22.886
Yeah, I know. They made
this frozen woolly mammoth stew.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.159
This is my field trip,
young man.

04:37.677 --> 04:39.167
That's five even. Yeah?

04:45.551 --> 04:47.519
I don't need a bag. Thank you.

05:16.983 --> 05:21.113
My one in a million girl,
and I let her slip away.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.146
I felt so bad I could've
jumped into the Tar Pits.

05:25.925 --> 05:28.655
I thought
I'd never see her again.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.877
Fate is a funny thing.

05:50.917 --> 05:54.148
We must've been meant
to be together, Julie and I.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.485
They're so cramped.

05:56.522 --> 05:58.683
I can't eat these guys.

06:00.526 --> 06:04.724
I guess we're going to have
to take all of them, but to go.

06:04.764 --> 06:09.167
I'd like you to fly them back
to Maine and set them free, OK?

06:09.202 --> 06:11.796
- How much would that cost?
- Twelve hundred bucks.

06:11.838 --> 06:13.305
Twelve hundred dollars?

06:27.286 --> 06:30.255
I think I've always been
a romantic kind of guy.

06:30.289 --> 06:33.747
I just never had someone
to be romantic with before.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.662
It was just like
it's supposed to be.

06:42.668 --> 06:46.104
I mean, for me to find a girl
my age who actually knows...

06:46.139 --> 06:48.630
who Dicky Wells
and Vernon Brown were...

06:48.674 --> 06:51.472
there has to be
a cosmic plan of some sort.

07:35.154 --> 07:37.145
Tell me that they aren't bad.

07:51.938 --> 07:56.204
She's a very hip girl,
but a little old-fashioned.

07:56.242 --> 07:58.676
The way she brought
her grandfather Ivan...

07:58.711 --> 08:00.645
to see me play...

08:00.680 --> 08:03.843
like that trolley
we toured the Miracle Mile in...

08:03.883 --> 08:06.010
it's just a little out of time.

08:10.957 --> 08:14.154
I think it's time for a change.

08:14.193 --> 08:16.354
Maybe I should stop trying
to be the king...

08:16.395 --> 08:18.795
of the Glenn Miller
impersonators...

08:18.831 --> 08:22.665
take a teaching gig around here
at some junior high...

08:22.702 --> 08:25.830
see if there's a vacancy
in Julie's building.

08:31.577 --> 08:35.535
A lot of yuppies moving into
Park La Brea these days.

08:35.581 --> 08:38.379
I've been here
thirty-five years.

08:38.417 --> 08:41.784
Which building
do you guys live in?

08:41.821 --> 08:44.153
I live over there,
and, Julie, she lives...

08:44.190 --> 08:46.556
I live in another one.

08:46.592 --> 08:50.050
Oh, can I buy you kids
a tube steak?

08:50.096 --> 08:52.462
- Not for me.
- Well, yeah, sure.

08:52.498 --> 08:54.796
A little mustard
and some sauerkraut?

08:54.834 --> 08:56.893
- Got it.
- Great.

08:56.936 --> 08:59.564
Too bad you have to leave town.

08:59.605 --> 09:02.005
Ohh, it's too bad
you have to work tonight.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.066
Only until midnight.

09:04.110 --> 09:07.045
Well, I'm game.
Do you like to dance?

09:07.079 --> 09:09.843
No. I love to dance.

09:16.556 --> 09:20.583
Don't be embarrassed, hon.
Give me an intro.

09:20.626 --> 09:21.752
Harry Washello.

09:21.794 --> 09:24.422
Lucy Peters,
Julie's grandmother.

09:24.463 --> 09:26.522
- You play slide trombone?
- Yes, ma'am.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.933
I told Harry all about
your health food casserole.

09:29.969 --> 09:31.732
Why don't you go on
and heat it up...

09:31.771 --> 09:33.033
upstairs,
and we'll meet you up there?

09:33.072 --> 09:34.198
Well, honey.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.800
Julie, what about
the old tube steaks?

09:42.582 --> 09:45.050
Grandma.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.574
I'm sorry.

09:49.555 --> 09:53.047
Hey, what's the story?

09:53.092 --> 09:57.358
They haven't spoken
to each other in fifteen years.

09:57.396 --> 10:00.627
They still love each other
as much as anyone ever did.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.725
It must've been
a hell of a fight, huh?

10:02.768 --> 10:05.328
They can't even remember
what it's about.

10:05.371 --> 10:08.568
Stupid pride!

10:08.608 --> 10:10.599
It breaks my heart.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.602
We better go check him out.

10:22.121 --> 10:25.249
Well, time to sling hash.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.987
Well, why don't I come in,
sit down, guzzle some coffee?

10:28.027 --> 10:30.222
And watch me work? No way.

10:30.262 --> 10:32.093
- Come on.
- No.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.099
No.
You go back to your hotel...

10:34.133 --> 10:36.499
you clean your spit valve,
and take a nap...

10:36.535 --> 10:39.993
because you're going to need
all your energy tonight.

10:40.039 --> 10:42.098
I think I'm gonna head back
and take a nap.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.769
OK. 12:15.

11:03.896 --> 11:07.559
Third date, Harry, I'm going
to screw your eyes blue.

11:11.804 --> 11:15.604
Yep. Just your basic
old-fashioned girl.

11:34.927 --> 11:36.622
Julie Washello.

12:21.607 --> 12:24.098
Julie, Julie, Julie.

13:26.605 --> 13:28.095
Nothing?

14:45.584 --> 14:47.575
3:45.

14:53.893 --> 14:57.329
Finally meet the right girl,
and you blow it.

14:57.363 --> 15:00.196
Real good, Harry. Shit.

15:02.601 --> 15:05.570
I'm only
three and a half hours late.

15:05.604 --> 15:07.572
That shouldn't be a problem.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.097
Robot demons!

15:36.135 --> 15:38.865
You can backstroke
in a vat of dragon piss...

15:38.904 --> 15:40.701
for all I care about it, ma'am.

15:40.739 --> 15:43.435
Not me. Not spongy.

15:55.654 --> 15:59.090
This used to be
Romeo's Time Square.

16:00.659 --> 16:04.561
You into barbecue? I own
a little place down on Crenshaw.

16:04.596 --> 16:06.564
Best barbecued ribs in town.

16:06.598 --> 16:07.792
Julie here?

16:07.833 --> 16:09.494
I've eaten my way
up and down Crenshaw.

16:09.535 --> 16:10.968
Mel's Rib Hutch.

16:11.003 --> 16:13.301
Honey, Hogly Pogly's
Tyler Texas Barbecue...

16:13.339 --> 16:15.705
in Panorama City is tops.

16:15.741 --> 16:17.333
Panorama City?
Where the hell is that?

16:17.376 --> 16:20.140
Morning, Harry.
You just missed her.

16:20.179 --> 16:22.613
My alarm didn't go off.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.843
The power went out in the hotel.

16:24.883 --> 16:27.283
Really.

16:27.319 --> 16:30.720
- So, was she upset?
- Wouldn't you be?

16:30.756 --> 16:34.419
Yeah. Listen,
you got her phone number?

16:34.460 --> 16:36.724
It's in the book.

16:36.762 --> 16:39.230
Come on.

16:39.264 --> 16:40.925
It's under Lucy Peters...

16:40.966 --> 16:42.991
but I wouldn't wake her
right now if I were you.

16:44.703 --> 16:46.295
Are you eating something?

16:46.338 --> 16:51.742
Yeah. I'll have that gyro
and eggs and some coffee.

16:51.777 --> 16:54.678
I had the nastiest dream
about her the other night.

16:54.713 --> 16:57.238
- Oh, yeah? What's she do?
- Almost everything.

16:57.282 --> 16:58.749
I meant for a living, Harlan.

16:58.784 --> 17:00.843
I don't know. She's some kind
of stockbroker broad.

17:00.886 --> 17:02.820
Shh. Here she comes.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.452
- Morning.
- Good morning, Fred.

17:07.492 --> 17:08.686
Here's your coffee.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.160
She's got old Fred wrapped
around her finger, don't she?

17:12.196 --> 17:14.222
Shut up, will you, Harlan?
Jesus.

17:26.744 --> 17:28.906
You've reached
the Peters household.

17:28.947 --> 17:33.213
Please leave a message
at the sound of the beep.

17:33.252 --> 17:35.743
Julie, it's Harry.
Are you there?

17:38.757 --> 17:40.725
Listen,
I'm really sorry about this...

17:40.759 --> 17:42.090
but it's not
what you might think.

17:42.127 --> 17:45.221
My alarm didn't go off.
It's the truth.

17:45.264 --> 17:48.392
The power went out in the hotel,
and I just slept right through.

17:48.434 --> 17:53.428
So, well, it's 4:00
here at Johnie's, and...

17:53.472 --> 17:55.235
listen, if you want
to come on down...

17:55.274 --> 17:57.265
and we'll go out for
a little champagne breakfast...

17:57.309 --> 18:00.142
or something,
it would be great.

18:00.179 --> 18:02.113
Otherwise, I guess
I'll call you tomorrow...

18:02.147 --> 18:05.241
and, listen, I'm really,
really sorry about this.

18:05.284 --> 18:06.774
Good night.

18:46.859 --> 18:51.228
Dad, it's me, Chip. How come
the phone was busy just now?

18:51.263 --> 18:54.130
Jesus. Look.
I had to wake you, and...

18:54.166 --> 18:56.964
it's... it's happening!
I can't believe it...

18:57.002 --> 18:59.800
but we're locked into it.
Fifty minutes and counting.

18:59.838 --> 19:02.773
Christ, I just can't take it!
I can't fucking take it!

19:04.510 --> 19:06.740
I'm sorry, dad.
I shouldn't swear.

19:06.778 --> 19:07.904
I'm sorry, but this is it.

19:07.946 --> 19:09.743
This is really it!
This is the big one!

19:09.781 --> 19:11.681
Thor Arthur 66 ZZD.

19:11.717 --> 19:13.651
I told you what would happen
if it ever came down.

19:13.685 --> 19:17.348
Well, it is! We don't know why!
Why would we, huh?

19:17.389 --> 19:19.254
It's for real, dad!
It's no drill!

19:19.291 --> 19:21.191
We shoot our wad
in fifty minutes.

19:21.226 --> 19:22.818
They're going to
pick us up in five or ten...

19:22.861 --> 19:24.556
and you could get it back
in an hour and ten.

19:24.596 --> 19:26.689
Maybe seventy-five minutes!

19:26.732 --> 19:28.427
What exactly
are you talking about?

19:28.467 --> 19:30.799
I'm talking about
nuclear fucking war.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.202
Who is this?

19:33.238 --> 19:36.696
Where's my dad? Go get my dad!

19:36.742 --> 19:39.210
Your dad?
Look, there's nobody here.

19:39.244 --> 19:41.735
Where's he supposed to be?

19:41.780 --> 19:43.941
How the hell would I know?

19:43.982 --> 19:46.712
You're in Orange County.
I'm in North Dakota.

19:46.752 --> 19:49.220
Is this some kind of prank
or something?

19:49.254 --> 19:56.160
Prank? Prank? Oh, God!
Is this 254-9411?

19:56.195 --> 20:00.222
Yeah, it is, but, listen,
it's just a phone booth.

20:00.265 --> 20:02.233
It's a phone booth
at a coffee shop.

20:02.267 --> 20:07.000
Oh, is this 714? Did I dial 213?
Shit!

20:10.042 --> 20:12.340
I think they heard me. Shit!

20:12.377 --> 20:15.505
Oh, man, they see me
on the monitor. Fuck!

20:18.283 --> 20:20.717
I patched into
the red line excom to do this.

20:20.752 --> 20:23.243
They're going to nail my ass.
Tell dad...

20:23.288 --> 20:26.724
just tell him that
I am sorry about that summer.

20:26.758 --> 20:27.884
OK? He'll know what I mean.

20:27.926 --> 20:30.156
All right, all right,
look, that's enough.

20:30.195 --> 20:31.753
This is a joke, right?

20:31.797 --> 20:36.257
Yes, sir. No, sir. I was just
checking the circuits, sir.

20:36.301 --> 20:38.030
Wait. Wait!

20:42.307 --> 20:43.774
Security. Should I trace?

20:43.809 --> 20:45.242
Listen,
it's probably a felony...

20:45.277 --> 20:48.269
to joke around on the phone
like this.

20:48.313 --> 20:51.282
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

20:51.316 --> 20:54.774
Listen, I'm just a guy
who picked up the phone.

20:54.820 --> 21:00.816
I don't know if this is a wrong
phone number or a joke or what.

21:00.859 --> 21:04.795
What happened to Chip?
He was just joking, right?

21:04.830 --> 21:08.493
Forget everything you just
heard and go back to sleep.

21:36.028 --> 21:38.724
Oh, shit.

21:38.764 --> 21:41.426
The special's getting cold.
Put it back under the light.

21:47.472 --> 21:50.270
Hey, Landa, if I told you
you had a beautiful body...

21:50.309 --> 21:51.776
would you hold it against me?

21:55.080 --> 21:57.139
Will you grow up, Harlan?

21:57.182 --> 21:59.207
This is the Golden State,
this is the Ventura...

21:59.251 --> 22:00.548
this is the 101...

22:00.585 --> 22:02.815
and this is Hogly Pogly's
Tyler Texas Barbecue.

22:02.854 --> 22:03.980
But what is this, then...

22:04.022 --> 22:05.956
if this is the Golden State,
and this is the 101?

22:05.991 --> 22:08.186
I don't know. That's your
noodle. I didn't put that there.

22:08.226 --> 22:09.887
Shit.

22:09.928 --> 22:11.725
I just can't figure it out.

22:11.763 --> 22:14.129
OK, this is
the Harbor freeway...

22:14.166 --> 22:16.964
and this is the Santa Monica...

22:17.002 --> 22:19.266
and this is the 405.

22:19.304 --> 22:21.670
- You know the 405, don't you?
- Oh, shit.

22:21.707 --> 22:25.143
- Thank God for that.
- Shit.

22:25.177 --> 22:28.146
Hey, Landa, didn't I see you
at the nude bowling alley...

22:28.180 --> 22:29.977
out in Puente Hills?

22:30.015 --> 22:34.281
Harlan, Harlan, Harlan.
That's mature, Harlan.

22:46.298 --> 22:48.528
What did she do,
slap you through the phone?

22:51.036 --> 22:53.300
I answered the phone
out there...

22:53.338 --> 22:54.498
Great.

22:56.074 --> 22:58.133
- Can I have this?
- Sure.

23:22.768 --> 23:25.532
This can't be true.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.764
It can't...

23:29.274 --> 23:31.742
It was.

23:31.777 --> 23:33.267
It is.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.770
Jesus Christ.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.047
He grabbed me by the hand.

23:40.085 --> 23:43.248
This is the Hollywood freeway.
This is the Ventura freeway.

23:43.288 --> 23:44.778
Excuse me.

23:46.291 --> 23:48.418
Do you eat here a lot?

23:48.460 --> 23:50.189
Every night.

23:50.228 --> 23:52.059
I was just wondering
if you know...

23:52.097 --> 23:54.429
if anyone here
has a son named Chip?

23:54.466 --> 23:57.299
I had an uncle named Chet.

23:58.904 --> 24:00.735
Hey, I got a new joke for you.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.967
A new joke? Go ahead.

24:03.008 --> 24:04.566
Postman comes to the door, see?

24:04.609 --> 24:06.770
Broad opens the door.
She ain't got no clothes on.

24:06.812 --> 24:09.280
She takes him upstairs,
she fucks his brains out.

24:09.314 --> 24:11.043
Hey, hey, you guys?

24:11.082 --> 24:14.051
Excuse me.
I answered the phone out...

24:14.085 --> 24:16.747
- She takes him to the door...
- Excuse me!

24:16.788 --> 24:18.380
Hands him five dollars, see?

24:18.423 --> 24:20.584
Hey! Hey! You guys!

24:20.625 --> 24:21.785
Hey! Shut up!

24:23.261 --> 24:25.229
Look, this could be
very important.

24:25.263 --> 24:28.721
Does anyone here
have a son in a missile silo?

24:28.767 --> 24:31.736
- A missile silo?
- Yeah, North Dakota.

24:31.770 --> 24:33.499
Chip.

24:33.538 --> 24:34.527
Look, I know how this sounds...

24:34.573 --> 24:37.337
but I answered the phone
out there...

24:37.375 --> 24:40.003
and the guy on the other end,
he was very, very frantic.

24:40.045 --> 24:42.775
He thought I was his dad
for a minute.

24:42.814 --> 24:44.748
I think he just had
the wrong area code.

24:44.783 --> 24:46.250
Yeah? So what?

24:46.284 --> 24:49.253
So he was calling
from a missile silo.

24:49.287 --> 24:51.152
He said that
they were locked in...

24:51.189 --> 24:55.421
fifty minutes and counting...
to shoot off their nuclear wad.

24:56.761 --> 25:00.094
We would be getting it back
in an hour and ten.

25:01.700 --> 25:04.794
I mean,
he meant that we're at war.

25:06.071 --> 25:08.801
Nuclear war.

25:22.087 --> 25:23.714
Who the fuck is this bozo?

25:23.755 --> 25:26.246
I don't know, Harlan. This is
scaring the shit out of me.

25:26.291 --> 25:27.417
Yeah, you and me both.

25:27.459 --> 25:29.552
- What's your problem, man?
- It's the witching hour.

25:29.594 --> 25:31.619
All the weirdos come out
just before dawn.

25:31.663 --> 25:34.723
This is probably just
somebody's very sick joke.

25:34.766 --> 25:37.530
I thought so, too, at first,
but if you could've heard him...

25:37.569 --> 25:40.129
I mean, it was just too real
to be wrong.

25:40.171 --> 25:42.469
There's lots of good actors
in this town with insomnia...

25:42.507 --> 25:45.567
and nothing better to do
than stupid things like that.

25:45.610 --> 25:47.635
I saw him on the phone
out there.

25:47.679 --> 25:49.374
I don't know
what he said or heard...

25:49.414 --> 25:51.473
but I saw him on the phone.

25:51.516 --> 25:53.984
- Me, too!
- What a crock! Over what?

25:54.019 --> 25:55.680
Man, are you drunk?

25:55.720 --> 25:57.347
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong with you?

25:57.389 --> 26:00.324
Hey, there's nothing
wrong with me.

26:00.358 --> 26:03.384
That guy on the phone
might be wrong, but I'm not...

26:03.428 --> 26:05.419
and what I heard is right.

26:05.463 --> 26:08.489
Los Angeles.
Do you have today's code?

26:08.533 --> 26:11.502
Can you please tell me,
are we at forced readiness?

26:11.536 --> 26:12.764
Has that been confirmed?

26:12.804 --> 26:15.705
Why would we be at war?
There's no big crisis anywhere.

26:15.740 --> 26:18.402
Not that we know about.

26:18.443 --> 26:20.206
There's never going
to be a good enough reason why.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.179
We would never attack.

26:22.213 --> 26:25.478
If it was the fucking Russkies,
I might believe it, but not us.

26:25.517 --> 26:27.075
And Thato, too?

26:29.387 --> 26:31.947
When did they leave?

26:31.990 --> 26:34.458
- Landa.
- Thank you.

26:34.492 --> 26:37.620
Landa, you said
we had to strike first...

26:37.662 --> 26:39.220
if it ever came down to it.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.732
Remember, you told me that?
Do you remember?

26:41.766 --> 26:43.028
I remember, Fred.

26:43.068 --> 26:45.332
- Preemptive first strike!
- Shit!

26:45.370 --> 26:47.634
They have to evacuate us first,
don't they?

26:47.672 --> 26:50.004
You tell me where to?
And when was the last time...

26:50.041 --> 26:52.441
they told you what to do
in case? There's no plans.

26:52.477 --> 26:54.172
Earth to everybody!

26:54.212 --> 26:56.578
Let's all get back
to reality here.

26:56.615 --> 27:00.483
It's 4:00 in the a.m. Really!
More java, please.

27:00.518 --> 27:03.112
I hope this isn't happening.

27:03.154 --> 27:05.384
I used to have real awful
dreams about atom bombs.

27:05.423 --> 27:07.755
Come on! We forgot about it!

27:07.792 --> 27:09.623
It doesn't mean
it's not gonna happen!

27:09.661 --> 27:12.824
Come on, Harlan,
we build three warheads a week!

27:12.864 --> 27:14.263
Is the senator in?

27:18.236 --> 27:20.170
Oh, really?

27:21.740 --> 27:23.640
No. It can't be!

27:27.045 --> 27:29.707
OK! I'm very serious
about this shit!

27:29.748 --> 27:32.478
Now you tell me now!
You're joking, huh?

27:33.485 --> 27:35.214
Come on, man.

27:35.253 --> 27:37.050
Leave him alone, Fred.
He's just drunk.

27:37.088 --> 27:39.181
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

27:39.224 --> 27:42.284
If you are, you tell me now.

27:42.327 --> 27:46.229
Why in hell would I
make up this story, huh?

27:46.264 --> 27:50.530
Look, if you want me
to say so, I will, but...

27:50.568 --> 27:52.695
- But what?
- Fred, Fred, put the gun away!

27:52.737 --> 27:53.897
But what?

27:55.273 --> 27:57.104
It's true.

28:01.046 --> 28:02.843
I ain't takin' no chances.

28:02.881 --> 28:04.746
Joe, get the truck!

28:04.783 --> 28:07.752
Jeez Louise, I never seen him
riled up like that before.

28:07.786 --> 28:10.186
Come here. Come here.

28:10.221 --> 28:11.688
What's your name?

28:11.723 --> 28:13.190
- Harry.
- Harry.

28:13.224 --> 28:14.851
Can you repeat the conversation
to me, please...

28:14.893 --> 28:16.417
verbatim, if you can?

28:16.461 --> 28:19.589
- Um, yeah, OK.
- Come on!

28:19.631 --> 28:21.895
Nobody believes this, do they?

28:21.933 --> 28:23.457
I mean, if I said it,
nobody would.

28:23.501 --> 28:25.696
Will you shut up?
Just let him talk.

28:25.737 --> 28:27.602
Go ahead.

28:27.639 --> 28:30.039
OK, well, I answered the phone
because it was ringing.

28:30.075 --> 28:33.374
And the guy,
he just started yelling...

28:33.411 --> 28:36.278
"Dad! Dad! It's happening!

28:36.314 --> 28:38.282
"The big one. We're locked in.

28:38.316 --> 28:40.580
"Thor Arthur 66 DDZ."

28:40.618 --> 28:42.882
Wait a minute.

28:42.921 --> 28:44.445
Say that last part again.

28:44.489 --> 28:48.084
It's Thor Arthur 66 DDZ.

28:48.126 --> 28:50.560
And then he started going,
"Oh, my God!

28:50.595 --> 28:53.086
"We shoot off our wad
in fifty minutes.

28:53.131 --> 28:55.463
"You're going to be getting it
back in an hour and ten."

28:55.500 --> 28:56.762
Then I said something...

28:56.801 --> 28:59.599
and he realized
that I wasn't his dad.

28:59.637 --> 29:02.231
And so I asked him
if it was a prank.

29:02.273 --> 29:06.232
And he went,
"A prank? Oh, God, a prank."

29:06.277 --> 29:09.678
He was just trying to call
his dad in Orange County.

29:09.714 --> 29:12.182
And then, uh...

29:12.217 --> 29:15.186
and then he said,
"They see me on the monitor."

29:15.220 --> 29:16.687
And then someone came in...

29:16.721 --> 29:21.215
and he started going,
"Yes, sir. No, sir."

29:23.294 --> 29:24.761
Then they shot him.

29:24.796 --> 29:28.095
No. No. I heard gunshots.

29:28.133 --> 29:30.499
And then someone else
got on the line.

29:30.535 --> 29:34.232
And I said,
"Hey, is this a joke?"

29:35.740 --> 29:39.870
And all he said was...

29:39.911 --> 29:42.209
"Forget everything
you just heard...

29:42.247 --> 29:44.272
"and go back to sleep."

29:45.750 --> 29:49.709
I knew they'd do some
stupid shit like this one day!

29:49.754 --> 29:52.348
They ain't gonna catch me
with my pants down!

29:52.390 --> 29:55.723
Heck, I'm going up
to the San Gabriel mountains!

29:55.760 --> 29:59.321
Mine shaft! Anybody that helps
can come, but bring cans!

29:59.364 --> 30:01.059
Bring lots of cans!

30:01.099 --> 30:02.862
I'm coming with you, Freddie!

30:04.169 --> 30:06.660
That Thor Arthur stuff,
that meant something to you.

30:06.704 --> 30:10.299
I know it did!
Is that the code for it?

30:10.341 --> 30:11.467
It's possible.

30:11.509 --> 30:12.976
How the hell
would you know, lady?

30:13.011 --> 30:14.171
Because I used to date a guy...

30:14.212 --> 30:15.873
who worked
at the Rand Corporation.

30:15.914 --> 30:17.472
I've just been trying to reach
a few of our friends...

30:17.515 --> 30:18.880
who could tell me
if the unthinkable...

30:18.917 --> 30:20.908
was being thought about in D.C.

30:20.952 --> 30:22.783
At this very moment,
4 out of 5 are in transit...

30:22.821 --> 30:24.254
to the extreme
southern hemisphere.

30:24.289 --> 30:26.189
I find that
more than just very curious.

30:26.224 --> 30:27.748
So what do we do?

30:27.792 --> 30:29.987
We have less than
forty-six minutes till we know.

30:30.028 --> 30:32.223
And then everyone will.

30:32.263 --> 30:34.754
I'd like a head start.
The streets will be jammed.

30:34.799 --> 30:36.198
I'm ready
to make a commitment...

30:36.234 --> 30:38.532
to getting to the airport
as fast as possible...

30:38.570 --> 30:41.266
and finding out from there.
Step on a plane, at least.

30:41.306 --> 30:43.900
- Come on.
- This is fuckin' crazy!

30:43.942 --> 30:46.570
Come on, buddy! I'm going.

30:46.611 --> 30:48.511
How far do you have to go
to get away from an atom bomb?

30:48.546 --> 30:50.309
There won't be any atom bomb,
just missiles.

30:50.348 --> 30:53.010
A dozen for L.A., I bet.

30:53.051 --> 30:56.612
Make a mental note... line up
heliport shuttle to L.A.X.

30:58.556 --> 31:01.024
Hey, hey, hey! Wait a second!

31:01.059 --> 31:02.185
Where does Julie live?

31:02.227 --> 31:03.819
Park La Brea.
It's just over there.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.796
I know, I know,
but which building?

31:05.830 --> 31:08.424
It's building 351.
Let me go!

31:08.466 --> 31:09.797
351.

31:09.834 --> 31:12.769
Roger! You coming with us?

31:14.772 --> 31:16.763
Suit yourself.

31:18.810 --> 31:21.745
Where do we go where
the radiation won't get us?

31:21.779 --> 31:23.804
What about Mexico or Hawaii?
Let's go to Hawaii.

31:23.848 --> 31:25.247
No tropics.

31:25.283 --> 31:27.808
Ocean, clouds, rain, forget it.
It's got to be a desert, right?

31:27.852 --> 31:30.787
Like the Sahara or the Gobi.
Fuck the Gobi.

31:30.822 --> 31:32.119
We're going to Antarctica
if it's true.

31:32.156 --> 31:33.714
Wait a minute!

31:33.758 --> 31:35.749
There's a valley there
with zero rainfall.

31:35.793 --> 31:37.260
Plenty of fresh water
in the snow...

31:37.295 --> 31:38.922
for generations, if need be.

31:38.963 --> 31:41.830
Is that the North Pole
or the South Pole?

31:44.903 --> 31:46.268
Landa says we have
to go to the airport.

31:46.304 --> 31:48.534
Shit, man.

31:48.573 --> 31:50.666
Mike, I want you and Susie
to make a list for me...

31:50.708 --> 31:52.266
people who we want
to bring along...

31:52.310 --> 31:54.005
scientists, leaders,
great minds.

31:54.045 --> 31:55.672
I want it in five minutes, OK?

31:55.713 --> 31:57.271
Jesus.

32:00.652 --> 32:04.088
Los Angeles.
Number for Ivan Peters.

32:04.122 --> 32:05.453
Mr. Sagan
will want to be informed.

32:05.490 --> 32:07.481
Fred, let's go!

32:07.525 --> 32:09.755
I told you we need cans!
Lots of cans!

32:09.794 --> 32:13.389
Hey, only if we get somewhere!
Come on!

32:13.431 --> 32:14.989
Thank you very much.

32:26.144 --> 32:28.635
Hey, someone stole my car.
You got to give me a ride.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.147
Yeah, I guess so.

32:30.181 --> 32:32.581
Listen, we got to go
get Julie first, OK?

32:32.617 --> 32:35.552
- Before the airport!
- Yeah, hop on!

32:37.689 --> 32:40.351
Hey! Wait up!

32:42.226 --> 32:44.421
Come on! We got you!

33:02.447 --> 33:03.846
It's the LSA charter lines.

33:03.881 --> 33:05.678
The head is
Charles Morton Samuel.

33:05.717 --> 33:06.843
Wake him up. Any price.

33:06.884 --> 33:08.943
No amount is absurd, right?
Go for it.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.785
- What about Pat Riley?
- Pat Riley? Come on.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.950
She said leaders.
My cousin knows him.

33:13.992 --> 33:16.119
Just write down what I say, OK?

33:16.160 --> 33:17.627
- We're talking mensa.
- Mensa.

33:17.662 --> 33:20.130
That's not a person.
That's an organization.

33:20.164 --> 33:22.098
People like Linus Pauling.
Write this down.

33:22.133 --> 33:24.465
You must know some pilots?
Any charter lines?

33:24.502 --> 33:28.700
Well, actually,
it's my sister's outfit.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.732
Jane and Tom, Harry Belafonte.

33:31.776 --> 33:34.711
Ah, what about Joyce Brothers?
She's really smart.

33:34.746 --> 33:36.213
Fuck Joyce Brothers!

33:36.247 --> 33:38.477
Tell Archie to break into
that ski shop in Culver City.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.814
Tell him to get
all the down clothing he can.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.342
Down, down. Yeah, like a duck.

33:42.387 --> 33:44.617
The super warm stuff, you know?
All he can get.

33:44.655 --> 33:46.816
Is anyone here a Christian?

33:46.858 --> 33:49.827
You know, like a hard-core one?

33:49.861 --> 33:52.125
Danny Berrigan and his brother.

33:52.163 --> 33:54.791
Yeah, Bobby Seale, Dick Gregory.

33:56.367 --> 33:58.392
You got these people's
phone numbers?

33:58.436 --> 34:00.165
Terry, did you get
a hold of him yet?

34:00.204 --> 34:01.603
No, get this lined up first.

34:01.639 --> 34:03.664
Don't waste time
if there's no point, get it?

34:03.708 --> 34:05.972
Stay calm. Optimum efficiency.

34:11.215 --> 34:12.341
Oprah Winfrey!

34:16.154 --> 34:17.815
This isn't right.

34:19.157 --> 34:20.886
We should be at Park La Brea.

34:20.925 --> 34:22.688
- What?
- We got to get Julie.

34:22.726 --> 34:24.422
- Who's Julie?
- Who are you?

34:24.462 --> 34:25.895
Well, who are you?

34:27.465 --> 34:28.989
Hey, where are we going?

34:29.033 --> 34:31.661
- The airport.
- The airport?

34:33.071 --> 34:35.539
Listen, you said
you were gonna go get Julie!

34:35.572 --> 34:37.768
- I lied.
- You lied?

34:37.809 --> 34:39.572
I wanted to secure
the heliport...

34:39.610 --> 34:40.838
for a rendezvous
to the airport...

34:40.878 --> 34:43.141
ready to leave
no later than 5 to 5:00.

34:43.181 --> 34:44.808
Where's this rendezvous?
Which heliport?

34:44.849 --> 34:48.512
5900 Wilshire. Sorry, Harry.
There's no turning back now.

34:48.553 --> 34:50.918
OK, look,
you got to stop and let me off.

34:50.955 --> 34:52.513
No way, man. No chance.

34:52.556 --> 34:55.025
Every minute counts,
and I don't stop for nothing.

34:55.059 --> 34:56.924
Come on!
I got to go back and get Julie.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.758
That's tough shit, man.
I love her, too...

34:58.796 --> 35:00.058
but it's dog eat dog now.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.157
Call her when you get there.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.168
Look, stop the truck!

35:04.202 --> 35:05.567
- Fuck you.
- Harry!

35:05.603 --> 35:07.161
Let me go! Stop the truck!

35:07.205 --> 35:09.503
Mr. Sagan,
can you hold, please?

35:09.540 --> 35:12.703
You want to jump?
Jump when I make that on-ramp!

35:22.587 --> 35:24.987
Yeah. Like when
you blow a tire at eighty...

35:25.022 --> 35:26.182
and you're heading
for the wall...

35:26.224 --> 35:28.715
and you don't have time
to say anything but whoops.

35:28.759 --> 35:29.987
Mr. Sagan.

35:30.027 --> 35:32.894
Yes, I understand.
I do apologize...

35:32.930 --> 35:35.490
but what I'm about to tell you
is something quite horrific.

36:45.169 --> 36:46.659
Shit.

37:00.685 --> 37:02.152
I'm dreaming.

37:02.186 --> 37:03.813
That's it, I'm dreaming.

37:10.127 --> 37:11.617
Fuck!

37:17.001 --> 37:18.298
Hey! Stop!

37:32.316 --> 37:34.045
Hey, look.
Don't hurt me, man, OK?

37:34.085 --> 37:35.211
Look, just look in the trunk...

37:35.253 --> 37:36.481
and get you
a stereo or speakers, man.

37:36.520 --> 37:39.080
I got Nakamichi, Pioneer...
I got everything, man.

37:39.123 --> 37:41.614
- Just help yourself, all right?
- Would you just shut up?

37:41.659 --> 37:43.388
I'll say it was
a Mexican family, OK?

37:43.427 --> 37:45.987
- I ain't even seen your face!
- Shut up! Shut up!

37:47.265 --> 37:50.496
- Just go back the on-ramp.
- OK, whatever you say, man.

37:52.603 --> 37:55.834
Just drive as fast as you can
and keep going.

37:55.873 --> 37:57.966
Don't stop at any light
unless I say so.

37:58.009 --> 38:00.170
This is as fast as it goes!

38:02.680 --> 38:04.671
This is the wrong way!

38:12.590 --> 38:14.285
You're not going to hurt me,
are you?

38:14.325 --> 38:16.657
Look, I've never hurt anybody
in my entire life...

38:16.694 --> 38:18.719
but I'm gonna use this
if I have to.

38:22.633 --> 38:24.157
What's your name?

38:24.201 --> 38:25.793
It's Wilson.

38:27.672 --> 38:29.970
Wilson? Well, I'm Harry.

38:32.209 --> 38:34.268
What's the hurry, Harry?

38:34.312 --> 38:35.939
I got to catch a plane.

38:35.980 --> 38:38.744
The airport's
back that way, man.

38:38.783 --> 38:40.580
I know! I forgot something.

38:40.618 --> 38:43.109
OK, man, I believe you.
I do. I swear.

38:43.154 --> 38:47.147
Whatever you say. Just be cool.
Just be cool, man.

38:48.659 --> 38:50.456
If it doesn't happen...

38:50.494 --> 38:54.692
I'll pay you for any kind of
damage to your car or anything.

38:54.732 --> 38:56.666
If it doesn't happen.

38:59.670 --> 39:02.104
If what doesn't happen, man?

39:02.139 --> 39:05.131
Do you know
where Park La Brea is?

39:07.611 --> 39:10.512
You got enough gas to get there
and back to the airport?

39:10.548 --> 39:13.745
Not even close. I barely had
enough to get back to Venice.

39:13.784 --> 39:16.617
What, man?
If what doesn't happen? What?

39:18.823 --> 39:20.552
Pull into this gas station.

39:20.591 --> 39:23.719
That's for cabs.
They won't give us none.

39:40.644 --> 39:43.613
Give me the key.
I got to make a phone call.

39:43.647 --> 39:46.673
OK, listen, here.

39:46.717 --> 39:48.412
Here's twenty dollars.

39:48.452 --> 39:50.613
Now, just get enough gas
to get up there and back, OK?

39:50.654 --> 39:52.121
Yeah, sure. No sweat.

39:52.156 --> 39:53.453
Look, you stick with me...

39:53.491 --> 39:55.322
you're gonna be
one of the lucky ones.

40:15.112 --> 40:18.138
- Hello, Ivan?
- What the hell time is it?

40:18.182 --> 40:19.649
It's late. It's very late.

40:19.683 --> 40:21.275
Listen, I'm sorry
to call you this late.

40:21.318 --> 40:22.512
It's Harry Washello...

40:22.553 --> 40:25.613
and I have to tell you
something very, very important.

40:25.656 --> 40:28.056
It's gonna sound crazy,
but we got to wake up Julie...

40:28.092 --> 40:30.583
right now and get down
to the 5900 building.

40:30.628 --> 40:33.654
Hey, boy, what you doing?

40:33.697 --> 40:35.688
You trying to steal
some gas here?

40:35.733 --> 40:37.792
Hell, no, I ain't tryin'
to steal nothin', man.

40:37.835 --> 40:42.932
Harry, that's awfully hard
to fathom at this time of night.

40:42.973 --> 40:44.133
I know, I know.

40:44.175 --> 40:46.268
It's impossible to believe,
but you got to do this.

40:46.310 --> 40:48.278
You're only a couple blocks
away from them.

40:48.312 --> 40:52.078
Just wake them up
and wait for me out front.

40:52.116 --> 40:54.107
I'll be by there
in five minutes.

40:54.151 --> 40:55.880
I'll give you twenty dollars
for some gas.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.218
He said he'll give you
fifty dollars...

40:58.255 --> 41:00.223
plus this twenty
if you give us some gas.

41:00.257 --> 41:01.451
Don't shoot me,
all right, brother?

41:01.492 --> 41:03.517
I got car stereos... I got
Pioneer, I got Nakamichi...

41:03.561 --> 41:05.222
I got Sony, I got everything.

41:05.262 --> 41:07.628
I got a Blaupunkt
that's never been used.

41:07.665 --> 41:09.530
Maybe you want a CD, man.
You name it, I'll get it.

41:09.567 --> 41:11.558
This guy's crazy. Just let us
get a little bit of gas...

41:11.602 --> 41:13.729
and we'll be out of here.
We'll be gone.

41:13.771 --> 41:15.170
What's the problem?

41:15.206 --> 41:18.141
You want some gasoline? It's
gonna cost you fifty dollars.

41:18.175 --> 41:20.769
Cash money.
No credit cards, man.

41:20.811 --> 41:22.278
OK, there you go,
there's fifty dollars.

41:22.313 --> 41:23.803
If you could just
start pumping, please...

41:23.848 --> 41:25.509
we're in a real big hurry.

41:25.549 --> 41:26.777
I don't pump gas, man.

41:26.817 --> 41:28.512
You're gonna have
to pump that yourself.

41:32.523 --> 41:34.684
Y'all got the guns, man.

41:51.208 --> 41:53.199
OK, Julie, come on.

41:57.448 --> 41:59.279
You've reached
the Peters household.

41:59.316 --> 42:02.683
Please leave a message
at the sound of the beep.

42:13.731 --> 42:15.460
Holy mother of God, man.

42:15.499 --> 42:18.059
I'm gonna do five years
for this fuckin' gun.

42:18.102 --> 42:20.627
They'll give me ten years
for what's in my trunk.

42:20.671 --> 42:22.298
Don't do nothing rash, man.

42:22.339 --> 42:24.671
Drop your weapon, now!

42:24.708 --> 42:26.801
You! Get down on the ground!

42:26.844 --> 42:30.245
Now! Now!

42:30.281 --> 42:32.772
Spread your arms and legs!

42:32.816 --> 42:34.841
- Spread 'em!
- Spread 'em!

42:34.885 --> 42:38.377
I work here. He's been
trying to rob me all week.

42:38.422 --> 42:41.186
Bullshit! He's lying, officer.
You know you're lying, fool.

42:41.225 --> 42:42.351
He's lying, officer.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.759
I can prove it.
I got plenty of identification.

42:44.795 --> 42:45.921
It's that guy's car.

42:45.963 --> 42:48.397
Officer, I can explain.

42:48.432 --> 42:50.923
Look in his trunk. He's got all
kinds of stolen stuff in there.

42:50.968 --> 42:52.401
Keep your mouth shut!

42:56.907 --> 42:58.772
Halt!

43:01.545 --> 43:04.013
Carol!
Get away from the pumps, Carol!

43:04.048 --> 43:06.209
Move away from the pumps!

43:27.404 --> 43:28.871
Get in!

43:44.221 --> 43:45.950
I had to do that
back there, man!

43:45.990 --> 43:47.617
I had to, you understand, huh?

43:47.658 --> 43:49.125
I had stolen stuff in my trunk.

43:49.159 --> 43:50.990
I had tickets,
I had warrants, man.

43:51.028 --> 43:53.553
I had to squirt them,
but they didn't have to shoot!

43:53.597 --> 43:56.896
Explosion and/or related fire
reported on Pico.

43:58.535 --> 44:00.799
Push the red button twice.

44:04.708 --> 44:08.667
Hello. What are the latest
on the evacuation plans?

44:08.712 --> 44:11.180
Please identify yourself.

44:11.215 --> 44:12.614
This is Mr. Peters...

44:12.650 --> 44:15.585
with the, uh, Atomic Energy
Commission.

44:15.619 --> 44:16.916
What?

44:16.954 --> 44:20.287
We have a Code Arthur situation.
Haven't you been informed?

44:20.324 --> 44:22.622
We have nothing at all
at the headquarters, sir.

44:22.660 --> 44:24.127
What's the source
of your information?

44:24.161 --> 44:25.924
They don't even know yet.

44:25.963 --> 44:28.989
Could you give us
your present location?

44:30.634 --> 44:34.126
Is that what it is? A meltdown?

44:34.171 --> 44:36.298
Yeah, man, yeah. Yeah, it is.

44:36.340 --> 44:38.604
You work at the plant, man?
Is that how you know, huh?

44:40.544 --> 44:42.512
Oh, man, my sister
goes to those rallies.

44:42.546 --> 44:45.538
She'll be blown out...
I mean, really blown out.

44:47.518 --> 44:49.611
When's the cloud come?

44:51.121 --> 44:52.611
Within the hour.

44:58.595 --> 44:59.823
What do we do?

44:59.863 --> 45:02.161
Look, the streets
are gonna be completely jammed.

45:02.199 --> 45:04.667
There's a helicopter rendezvous
down here at Wilshire...

45:04.702 --> 45:06.294
that'll shuttle to the airport.

45:10.974 --> 45:13.534
Listen, just wait here.

45:13.577 --> 45:14.839
I have to go up
and get some people.

45:14.878 --> 45:16.175
It'll just take a minute.

45:16.213 --> 45:18.408
Where's the heliport?
Is it that mutual building?

45:18.449 --> 45:20.076
I got to get
my sister Charlotta, man.

45:20.117 --> 45:21.607
She can come with us,
can't she?

45:21.652 --> 45:23.347
I got to get her, man.
I got to get her.

45:23.387 --> 45:27.915
Honk the horn in four minutes,
OK? Four minutes.

45:27.958 --> 45:31.086
I got to get her, man.

45:38.035 --> 45:39.195
C-14.

45:41.004 --> 45:42.164
Aw, shit.

45:43.173 --> 45:44.606
Ivan?

46:20.978 --> 46:22.138
Julie?

46:36.660 --> 46:38.628
Anybody here?

46:38.662 --> 46:40.653
Mrs. Peters?

46:46.670 --> 46:48.638
Mrs. Peters,
it's Harry Washello.

46:48.672 --> 46:50.469
You met me this afternoon.

46:50.507 --> 46:52.975
Oh, why, you're
the fine swing man, Harry.

46:53.010 --> 46:54.477
Yes, ma'am, that's right.
Where's Julie?

46:54.511 --> 46:57.071
Well, she's dead to the world.
You better come back tomorrow.

46:57.114 --> 46:59.981
- No, we've got to wake her up.
- Wait a minute.

47:00.017 --> 47:01.985
You just tell me
what the hell's going on.

47:02.019 --> 47:03.486
Mrs. Peters,
in a half an hour...

47:03.520 --> 47:06.148
there's gonna be
a full-on nuclear attack.

47:06.190 --> 47:07.987
The missiles
are on their way now.

47:08.025 --> 47:10.425
L.A.'s gonna be a desert again
very soon.

47:10.460 --> 47:12.758
- Why?
- I don't know why.

47:12.796 --> 47:14.263
Listen, grab anything
you want to take.

47:14.298 --> 47:15.856
We're going to the Mutual
Benefit Life building...

47:15.899 --> 47:17.025
on Wilshire.

47:17.067 --> 47:19.729
There's a helicopter there
that'll take us to the airport.

47:19.770 --> 47:20.930
God.

47:30.214 --> 47:32.648
I feel like Prince... somebody.

47:37.621 --> 47:41.352
Let's go! Let's get
out of here, man! Come on!

47:41.391 --> 47:43.882
Hold on! I'll be right there!

47:45.362 --> 47:47.523
Sorry, man, I got to go.

47:47.564 --> 47:49.327
Wait!

47:54.638 --> 47:55.866
Julie, wake up.

47:55.906 --> 47:59.342
Damn it! Pick up the phone!

47:59.376 --> 48:00.934
Do you have a car, Mrs. Peters?

48:00.978 --> 48:04.106
There's one down in the garage.
I haven't driven it for years.

48:04.147 --> 48:06.206
I don't even know
where the keys are.

48:08.118 --> 48:10.086
How long do we have?

48:10.120 --> 48:12.987
About 15 to 20 minutes
before the chopper leaves.

48:21.198 --> 48:23.564
Does she always sleep
this deep?

48:23.600 --> 48:27.036
She took a valium.

48:27.070 --> 48:30.130
Oh, you could give her
one of these diet pills...

48:30.173 --> 48:31.663
kind of speed it up.

48:31.708 --> 48:34.108
It'll make her sick,
but it'll wake her up.

48:34.144 --> 48:35.611
I think
I'll just let her sleep.

48:35.646 --> 48:39.104
I don't want her to know
until she has to.

48:46.256 --> 48:48.383
Lucy, can you jog along with us?

48:48.424 --> 48:51.951
Well, I'm elderly.
I'm not decrepit.

48:59.802 --> 49:01.702
Lucy?

49:01.738 --> 49:03.535
Ivan?

49:11.848 --> 49:13.213
Aw, darling.

49:16.319 --> 49:17.809
I think we better get going.

49:17.854 --> 49:21.585
No, no. We'll get the car
and catch up with you.

49:21.624 --> 49:23.285
5900 Wilshire.

49:57.193 --> 49:59.627
What am I doing in this cart?

50:01.130 --> 50:03.655
Did I sleep all day...

50:03.700 --> 50:05.930
or is it the next night?

50:07.303 --> 50:09.328
You didn't show.

50:09.372 --> 50:13.103
The power went out in the hotel.
The alarm didn't work.

50:13.142 --> 50:17.408
OK, could've happened.
You could've called.

50:17.447 --> 50:19.108
I tried. It was too late.

50:19.148 --> 50:20.911
Hey, you know, this thing
is kind of cutting into my leg.

50:20.950 --> 50:22.781
Maybe you could just,
like, get me out of this.

50:22.819 --> 50:25.845
OK, OK, OK.
Put your arm around my neck.

50:25.888 --> 50:27.515
Here... here we go.

50:27.557 --> 50:30.583
All right. OK, good.

50:30.626 --> 50:33.254
- You OK?
- Yeah, but my leg's asleep.

50:33.296 --> 50:35.924
- OK, come on.
- Wake up. Come on.

50:35.965 --> 50:37.660
You'll be OK. Come on, let's go.

50:39.869 --> 50:41.734
I know where we're going.

50:41.771 --> 50:43.068
You do?

50:43.106 --> 50:45.574
It's one of those
balloon rides, right?

50:45.608 --> 50:48.873
Champagne brunch, wafting out
over L.A. at sunrise.

50:48.911 --> 50:52.210
Sounds like something you'd
cook up, am I right? Huh?

50:52.248 --> 50:53.681
Yeah, maybe.

50:53.716 --> 50:56.378
With your luck,
it won't have any air in it.

50:56.419 --> 50:58.250
You're probably right
about that.

51:07.630 --> 51:09.120
Wait here.

51:12.869 --> 51:14.894
She doesn't know yet,
and I don't think she should...

51:14.937 --> 51:17.735
so let's just leave the car,
and we'll go up to the heliport.

51:17.774 --> 51:18.900
It's right across the street.

51:18.941 --> 51:20.670
No.
We're not going with you, Harry.

51:20.710 --> 51:23.338
We want to savor our time
together if this is happening.

51:23.379 --> 51:26.280
We're going to go to Lucy's
favorite place, Cantor's...

51:26.315 --> 51:28.840
and I'm gonna have
the greasiest, fattest...

51:28.885 --> 51:32.048
triple-bypass pastrami sandwich
they got.

51:32.088 --> 51:33.953
Well, I'm going
to let him eat it.

51:36.659 --> 51:38.627
This is so great.

51:38.661 --> 51:41.494
This is so completely great!

51:41.531 --> 51:43.021
I don't believe this.

51:43.065 --> 51:45.556
We just want to say
good-bye, honey.

51:45.601 --> 51:47.626
We love you.

51:47.670 --> 51:49.069
You, too, Harry.

51:49.105 --> 51:52.597
Well, wait. Wait, wait.
Where are you going?

51:52.642 --> 51:56.408
- We got a lot to talk about.
- Lots of catching up to do.

51:56.446 --> 51:58.380
You kids take care now.

51:59.982 --> 52:02.450
- Ease off on the gas, Lucy.
- Oh, criminy!

52:02.485 --> 52:05.511
For crying out loud, Lucy,
ease up!

52:13.429 --> 52:16.489
Well, no, no, no.
I want... I want to go! Wait!

52:16.532 --> 52:19.467
It's all right. They're
going to be fine. Come on.

52:19.502 --> 52:22.494
How did they ever get together?

52:22.538 --> 52:24.233
Tell me what's going on.

52:24.273 --> 52:26.241
- Well...
- Come on.

52:26.275 --> 52:27.606
It's a secret.

52:27.643 --> 52:30.237
I want to spend some time
with them, Harry.

52:30.279 --> 52:32.679
I want to talk with them.
What's the hurry?

52:32.715 --> 52:34.774
I'll tell you
when we get up to the top, OK?

52:36.285 --> 52:37.411
Where's the sable?

52:37.453 --> 52:38.920
I don't know where the sable is!

52:38.955 --> 52:40.047
Where are the hollow points?

52:40.089 --> 52:41.420
You were supposed to bring
the hollow points!

52:41.457 --> 52:44.187
Oh, God, just forget it.
Come on!

52:45.361 --> 52:47.226
I mean,
I don't want to be rude...

52:47.263 --> 52:50.528
and ruin this romantic surprise
you've got going...

52:50.566 --> 52:52.534
but, you know, I'd really
rather go down to Cantor's...

52:52.568 --> 52:54.468
and have breakfast
with them, OK?

52:54.504 --> 52:56.028
I mean, you know, no offense...

52:56.072 --> 52:58.540
but we can go up in a balloon
any old morning, right?

52:58.574 --> 52:59.973
Can't we?

53:00.009 --> 53:01.374
Harry,
what happened to your face?

53:01.410 --> 53:04.174
- Oh, I just slipped and fell.
- It looks bad.

53:04.213 --> 53:05.612
It's nothing.
I broke my glasses.

53:05.648 --> 53:10.176
It looks... let's just go have
pancakes at Cantor's, Harry.

53:10.219 --> 53:12.278
- Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!
- Hold the elevator!

53:12.321 --> 53:14.346
Damn it! What time is it?

53:15.992 --> 53:17.584
And they swore they'd never
talk to each other...

53:17.627 --> 53:19.527
till the day they died.

53:24.934 --> 53:28.995
Gosh, I used to try
to get them back together...

53:29.038 --> 53:32.098
but they always saw it coming
a mile away.

53:32.141 --> 53:34.371
They thought the other one
put me up to it.

53:34.410 --> 53:36.970
Jesus.

53:37.013 --> 53:38.310
When I was a kid...

53:38.347 --> 53:41.214
and I'd come out
from Boulder on vacation...

53:43.052 --> 53:46.112
he'd always take me to, like,
the Movieland Wax Museum...

53:46.155 --> 53:48.555
or some touristy place.

53:48.591 --> 53:50.889
And then, the next day,
I'd be with her...

53:50.927 --> 53:54.385
and she'd take me
to the exact same place.

53:54.430 --> 53:57.558
I'd have to pretend
that I'd never been there.

53:57.600 --> 54:01.593
It was so silly, so sad.

54:03.439 --> 54:06.602
We're going to make it. We are.

54:10.580 --> 54:14.744
The oxygen. Where's that thing?

54:17.553 --> 54:19.953
- Hey, y'all ready to go?
- You the pilot?

54:19.989 --> 54:21.752
- Pilot?
- Isn't there a pilot here?

54:21.791 --> 54:23.349
Not yet.
The clock's ticking, too.

54:23.392 --> 54:25.519
The first plane out
leaves in ten minutes.

54:27.463 --> 54:28.896
Here. Hold this.

54:28.931 --> 54:31.422
You guys friends of Landa's?

54:31.467 --> 54:34.561
You gotta take a helicopter
to get to the balloon?

54:34.604 --> 54:36.094
What balloon?

54:40.443 --> 54:41.910
Are you the helicopter pilot?

54:41.944 --> 54:44.845
No. I'm Gerstead. I don't know
if the guy will show.

54:44.880 --> 54:46.245
I think this is all
horse shit, anyhow.

54:46.282 --> 54:47.806
I ain't heard nothing
to verify it.

54:47.850 --> 54:49.078
You a friend of Landa's?

54:49.118 --> 54:50.551
Landa,
the lady with the mobile phone?

54:50.586 --> 54:52.679
Exactly. Right, the woman
with the mobile phone...

54:52.722 --> 54:54.952
sticking
out of her fucking ear!

54:54.991 --> 54:56.891
Listen, is this helicopter
all ready to fly?

54:56.926 --> 54:59.690
Yeah. If you can fly it. I've
put out over 4 grand so far...

54:59.729 --> 55:01.253
lining up things
for that bitch...

55:01.297 --> 55:02.958
and she better cough up
the reimbursement, too.

55:02.999 --> 55:05.593
It's gonna be one high-priced
yacht, let me tell you.

55:05.635 --> 55:08.365
- So it's all set?
- It's gassed and ready.

55:08.404 --> 55:09.598
I paid off the guard
to go home...

55:09.639 --> 55:11.106
which is where I'm gonna be
in another twenty minutes.

55:11.140 --> 55:12.198
That's the deal.
I'm out of here.

55:12.241 --> 55:13.970
- All right, give me the money.
- No.

55:15.478 --> 55:17.378
Where can I find a pilot?

55:17.413 --> 55:19.381
How? It's after 4:00.

55:19.415 --> 55:21.007
All the helicopter pilot bars
are closed...

55:21.050 --> 55:22.347
along with everything else.

55:22.385 --> 55:24.876
I checked off every name on
the shuttle's certified list.

55:24.920 --> 55:27.946
Some 'Nam jock is driving in
from Malibu for two Gs.

55:27.990 --> 55:30.891
He's on his way. The rest...
pissed off, no dice...

55:30.926 --> 55:32.052
the machine, there's no answer.

55:32.094 --> 55:34.085
What do you expect
this time of the morning?

55:34.130 --> 55:35.825
The only reason I'm still here
is that cunt...

55:35.865 --> 55:37.628
promised me three grand
to do all this shit.

55:37.667 --> 55:39.658
I brought up all the goddamn
chips from her office...

55:39.702 --> 55:41.033
all the files... hey!

55:41.070 --> 55:43.903
I want you guys to be witness
that I did everything she asked.

55:43.939 --> 55:47.102
All right, listen, I need you
to stay here and keep calling.

55:47.143 --> 55:48.804
Call for helicopter pilots,
all right?

55:48.844 --> 55:50.368
Call their neighbors
if you have to.

55:50.413 --> 55:52.313
Just don't give up, all right?

55:52.348 --> 55:53.781
It's happening, pal.

55:53.816 --> 55:57.183
I'm the one who took
the phone call. I told Landa.

55:57.219 --> 56:02.122
Harry, I'm very confused about
what's going on here.

56:03.993 --> 56:06.461
Julie, now stay here.

56:06.495 --> 56:09.293
Now, if I'm not back and
the pilot comes, go without me.

56:09.331 --> 56:12.767
Go without you, Harry? I don't
want to go anywhere at all.

56:12.802 --> 56:16.397
Julie!
Give me five minutes, OK?

56:16.439 --> 56:18.430
Trust me with this.

56:18.474 --> 56:20.442
With what?

56:20.476 --> 56:22.740
I love you.

56:28.050 --> 56:29.847
Oh, thank God.

56:29.885 --> 56:32.217
- Come on, come on, hurry.
- Come on.

56:32.254 --> 56:35.121
- Help me out here, will you?
- I am, I am. Just load.

56:36.292 --> 56:37.589
How many are going
first shuttle?

56:37.626 --> 56:38.854
Going where?

56:38.894 --> 56:41.488
- The South Pole.
- The South Pole?

56:41.530 --> 56:42.827
Vitamins...
where are the vitamins?

56:42.865 --> 56:43.991
Landa wanted
lots and lots of vitamins.

56:44.033 --> 56:46.365
- Penicillin, too.
- What's going on here?

56:46.402 --> 56:48.165
Condoms!
We won't be needing these.

56:48.204 --> 56:50.172
We've got to repopulate
a whole planet.

56:50.206 --> 56:52.299
You could repopulate
a whole planet.

56:52.341 --> 56:54.138
How many warheads
are pegged for L.A.?

56:54.176 --> 56:55.643
Warheads?
What do you mean, warheads?

56:55.678 --> 56:58.442
L.A. Basin
is a total overkill sector.

56:58.481 --> 57:01.211
Oh, my God.

57:02.752 --> 57:03.946
Come on.

57:05.888 --> 57:07.788
Here. Here.

57:09.391 --> 57:11.382
Take it... supplies.

57:45.461 --> 57:46.951
Listen! Hey!

57:46.996 --> 57:48.964
Hey, do you know
anybody who can fly...

57:48.998 --> 57:50.625
Fuck you!

57:50.666 --> 57:51.860
Shit.

58:33.475 --> 58:38.469
People who know people...
friends, neighbors, anything.

58:38.514 --> 58:42.143
Can I see your membership card?

58:42.184 --> 58:43.344
Listen, excuse me...

58:43.385 --> 58:45.285
do you know anybody
who can fly a helicopter?

58:45.321 --> 58:47.152
Any helicopter pilots?

58:51.126 --> 58:55.085
Hey, hey, do you know anybody
who can fly a helicopter?

58:55.130 --> 58:58.099
Helicopter pilots, huh?

58:58.133 --> 59:02.092
Excuse me. Do you know anybody
who can fly a helicopter?

59:02.137 --> 59:03.627
Do you...

59:05.341 --> 59:07.605
Do you know
any helicopter pilots?

59:07.643 --> 59:09.133
Any... no.

59:12.648 --> 59:16.015
Excuse me. Anybody here
know any helicopter pilots?

59:16.051 --> 59:17.746
Anybody?

59:17.786 --> 59:20.186
Anybody here
know how to fly a helicopter?

59:23.893 --> 59:28.125
I said, does anybody here
know how to fly a helicopter?

59:28.163 --> 59:29.630
Oh, God, please don't shoot!

59:29.665 --> 59:31.633
Listen. It's an emergency.

59:31.667 --> 59:34.397
It's for a heart transplant.

59:40.009 --> 59:41.670
Can't anybody fly a helicopter?

59:41.710 --> 59:43.974
Hey! I can.

59:44.013 --> 59:45.605
You can fly a chopper?

59:45.648 --> 59:48.310
Bell jets, hughies.

59:48.350 --> 59:50.284
Pretty rusty.
It'd come back though.

59:50.319 --> 59:52.219
- I'll need bucks.
- Whatever you want, OK?

59:52.254 --> 59:56.782
But we got to go now. It's not
really for a transplant.

59:56.825 --> 01:00:00.090
All right? We'll all be dead
if we don't get out of here.

01:00:00.129 --> 01:00:02.597
It's a matter of minutes.

01:00:02.631 --> 01:00:04.121
What's the problem?

01:00:05.301 --> 01:00:07.963
It's a toxic fire... cyanide.

01:00:08.003 --> 01:00:10.267
The wind's starting to blow in
this direction.

01:00:10.306 --> 01:00:13.366
A lot of people are going
to die. We gotta go now.

01:00:13.409 --> 01:00:17.573
If shit like that's coming down,
I got to bring somebody, OK?

01:00:17.613 --> 01:00:19.547
Oh, look, man, there's no time.

01:00:22.051 --> 01:00:23.814
Then shoot me.

01:00:26.155 --> 01:00:28.055
All right. Go ahead. Go.

01:00:28.090 --> 01:00:31.116
Hurry!

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:34.129
Leslie! Come on! We're going.

01:00:34.163 --> 01:00:36.825
What the hell's going on?

01:00:36.865 --> 01:00:38.730
Any problem?

01:00:39.768 --> 01:00:42.236
No. No, no, no.
There's no problem.

01:00:46.742 --> 01:00:50.838
Do you know any pilots?
Any helicopter pilots?

01:00:50.879 --> 01:00:53.347
Do you know anybody
who can fly a helicopter?

01:00:53.382 --> 01:00:56.374
Aw, shit. Listen.
I got to go get someone.

01:00:56.418 --> 01:00:58.249
You guys go
up to the heliport, OK?

01:00:58.287 --> 01:01:00.812
It's right there at the Mutual
Benefit Life building, OK?

01:01:00.856 --> 01:01:02.255
You for real?

01:01:05.527 --> 01:01:07.620
Don't leave without us.

01:01:09.131 --> 01:01:10.621
I'll be there.

01:01:12.501 --> 01:01:14.435
Hey! Hey, wait!

01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:15.630
Come back!

01:01:37.226 --> 01:01:39.194
Oh, shit!

01:02:02.551 --> 01:02:04.519
Suspect has crashed
into department store...

01:02:04.553 --> 01:02:07.317
Officer, are you all right?

01:02:09.024 --> 01:02:11.720
A hundred feet or more
inside the store.

01:02:14.696 --> 01:02:16.254
Julie,
we got to get out of here.

01:02:16.298 --> 01:02:19.096
- Waiting for back-up.
- Roger, N1-14.

01:02:19.134 --> 01:02:21.102
SWAT team has been dispatched.

01:02:21.136 --> 01:02:23.263
The captain's order
is to clear the streets...

01:02:35.284 --> 01:02:37.878
I was... I was looking
for a pilot.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.182
It's OK.

01:02:39.288 --> 01:02:40.550
And they just smashed
through the window.

01:02:40.589 --> 01:02:42.022
Look! They're shot up!

01:02:42.057 --> 01:02:44.525
- Look!
- Oh, my God. Wilson.

01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:01.070
When's the cloud coming?

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:03.635
It should be here by now,
you said.

01:03:03.679 --> 01:03:06.580
It's been an hour.

01:03:06.615 --> 01:03:09.709
Nobody knows nothing, man.

01:03:09.751 --> 01:03:12.083
What do you mean, a cloud?

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:13.588
It's a meltdown.

01:03:13.622 --> 01:03:17.388
The streets will be jammed.

01:03:17.426 --> 01:03:19.223
What?

01:03:19.261 --> 01:03:21.786
Who told you it was a meltdown?

01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:23.889
That guy.

01:03:23.932 --> 01:03:26.628
He was there.
He works at the plant.

01:03:30.639 --> 01:03:33.233
This is the Los Angeles
Police Department...

01:03:33.275 --> 01:03:35.106
Special Weapons Tactical unit.

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:37.612
We have the building surrounded.

01:03:37.646 --> 01:03:41.047
Throw down your weapons
and give yourselves up.

01:03:41.083 --> 01:03:42.812
We're dying.

01:03:43.952 --> 01:03:45.579
I know.

01:03:48.957 --> 01:03:53.087
Is this your blood or mine?

01:03:53.128 --> 01:03:54.595
I don't know.

01:04:12.614 --> 01:04:14.605
Help me.

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:22.915
I got to catch up
with Charlotta.

01:04:22.958 --> 01:04:24.220
Do me, man.

01:04:24.259 --> 01:04:27.990
It ain't killing.
I'm gone anyway.

01:04:31.633 --> 01:04:33.123
Please!

01:04:53.689 --> 01:04:54.815
Come out now...

01:04:54.856 --> 01:04:58.087
with your hands in plain view
above your head.

01:05:05.968 --> 01:05:07.936
He said you told him
it was a meltdown.

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:09.528
I did.

01:05:09.571 --> 01:05:11.266
I didn't think
he'd believe the truth.

01:05:11.306 --> 01:05:13.297
What is the truth, Harry?

01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:15.367
Where did you hear
we'd started a war?

01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:17.571
Those people at the helicopter
said Landa told them...

01:05:17.613 --> 01:05:19.410
and you told Landa?

01:05:20.749 --> 01:05:23.616
Oh, God! What have I done?

01:05:27.889 --> 01:05:29.914
You told everybody, Harry?

01:05:29.958 --> 01:05:32.893
They only heard from you?
You took the phone call?

01:05:32.928 --> 01:05:35.419
Fifty minutes and counting.

01:05:35.464 --> 01:05:36.988
It's been over an hour now.

01:05:37.032 --> 01:05:39.364
They must've called it off
somehow.

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:44.471
Well, that's great news.

01:05:44.506 --> 01:05:47.532
This is your last warning,
cop killer!

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:50.409
Do you know what they're
talking about, Harry? Do you?

01:05:50.445 --> 01:05:52.743
You and that kid
didn't shoot somebody, did you?

01:05:52.781 --> 01:05:53.907
They were blinded.

01:05:53.949 --> 01:05:57.043
They just pulled their own
trigger and blew themselves up.

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:02.384
Well, we've got
to tell them something.

01:06:02.424 --> 01:06:06.053
We have to tell them something
before they start shooting.

01:06:06.094 --> 01:06:08.187
Uh, I'll go out there,
and I'll tell them...

01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:10.926
that we just...
we walked in on this.

01:06:10.966 --> 01:06:12.934
We were just bystanders.
We didn't...

01:06:12.968 --> 01:06:16.062
we didn't know
what was happening in here, OK?

01:06:16.104 --> 01:06:18.868
OK, Harry? It's going to be OK.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:35.479
And, hell, I'll write an article
about all this for Esquire.

01:06:35.524 --> 01:06:38.516
Somebody will probably
make a TV movie out of it.

01:07:01.850 --> 01:07:03.841
I'm just a bystander!

01:07:07.622 --> 01:07:08.782
Don't shoot!

01:07:19.601 --> 01:07:21.068
Coming out!

01:07:21.103 --> 01:07:24.072
Abort all activities
and return to precinct.

01:07:24.106 --> 01:07:25.596
It's just me!

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:30.237
I'm just walking out slowly.

01:07:45.761 --> 01:07:47.786
I'm just walking right out!

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:53.391
Hey, where you going?

01:07:56.571 --> 01:07:58.562
What the hell's going on?

01:08:10.218 --> 01:08:12.049
Where are the police going?

01:08:12.087 --> 01:08:15.215
You said it would've happened
already by now if it was, right?

01:08:15.257 --> 01:08:18.225
This isn't rush hour.
People aren't going to work.

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.783
Yeah, but I can still be
Chicken Little.

01:08:19.828 --> 01:08:21.853
Wait for me!

01:08:21.897 --> 01:08:23.660
Come on, we got to go.

01:08:23.698 --> 01:08:24.858
Slow down!

01:08:52.627 --> 01:08:56.256
714-254...

01:09:10.612 --> 01:09:13.103
Hello, look, I'm sorry about
calling you this early.

01:09:13.148 --> 01:09:16.515
I just want to know...
do you have a son named Chip?

01:09:16.551 --> 01:09:18.109
Yeah. So?

01:09:18.153 --> 01:09:19.676
Did something happen?

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:21.120
No, no. He's fine.

01:09:21.156 --> 01:09:25.115
I just want to know
if you know where he is.

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:27.492
North Dakota. Why?

01:09:29.163 --> 01:09:31.359
In a missile silo?

01:09:31.399 --> 01:09:33.799
Hey, look, pal.
That's classified.

01:09:33.835 --> 01:09:35.631
Call back tomorrow.

01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:37.001
Hey, hey, wait a second!
Hey, hey!

01:09:37.037 --> 01:09:39.973
He wanted to say he was
sorry about... shit!

01:09:48.617 --> 01:09:50.107
Come on.

01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:05.261
We've got to find a pilot.

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:07.461
- I already found one.
- What?

01:10:07.502 --> 01:10:09.527
I hope he's still up there.

01:10:09.571 --> 01:10:10.765
I'm scared.

01:10:13.141 --> 01:10:14.768
So scared.

01:10:29.925 --> 01:10:31.654
Shit.

01:10:35.664 --> 01:10:37.393
Julie, listen to me.
Listen to me.

01:10:37.432 --> 01:10:38.831
I need you to go
back up to the heliport.

01:10:38.867 --> 01:10:40.459
Right now, OK?
I'll be right there.

01:10:40.502 --> 01:10:41.799
I don't want to go anywhere
without you.

01:10:41.836 --> 01:10:44.202
Hey, get the fuck out of here!

01:10:44.239 --> 01:10:46.207
Now listen, I just saw
the helicopter pilot...

01:10:46.241 --> 01:10:48.732
over there, OK? I got to go
catch him, all right?

01:10:48.777 --> 01:10:50.972
Go back up there. Take this.

01:10:51.012 --> 01:10:53.003
No, no, no.
There's no bullets.

01:10:53.048 --> 01:10:55.949
Just point it at anybody
if there's any trouble, OK?

01:10:55.984 --> 01:10:57.611
It's just not safe anymore.

01:10:57.652 --> 01:10:59.142
- I love you.
- What?

01:10:59.187 --> 01:11:02.350
I love you. I love you.

01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:04.255
I love you, too, OK?

01:11:07.362 --> 01:11:09.694
Just go and hurry, OK?

01:11:09.731 --> 01:11:12.928
Don't look back, all right?
Go on! Go on!

01:11:15.637 --> 01:11:17.264
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

01:11:32.153 --> 01:11:33.643
Hold it!

01:11:47.802 --> 01:11:50.066
Hey, come on. Let's go.

01:11:50.105 --> 01:11:51.595
I'm sorry. I...

01:11:53.108 --> 01:11:55.668
Have they said anything?

01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:57.109
Have they confirmed it?

01:12:04.386 --> 01:12:07.583
...spreading like wildflowers...
wildfire.

01:12:07.622 --> 01:12:10.250
Unconfirmed rumors
of possible nuclear attack...

01:12:10.291 --> 01:12:11.451
have spread throughout...

01:12:13.361 --> 01:12:16.592
I think we're going
to a live feed now...

01:12:16.631 --> 01:12:18.565
from... from Brian Jones.

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.932
Brian Jones down on the street.

01:12:20.969 --> 01:12:22.334
Brian, can you hear me?

01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:24.133
It's absolute madness!

01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:27.269
We're not people anymore.
It's like...

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:30.438
It's total chaos!

01:12:30.478 --> 01:12:32.537
The fear... it's total!
It's absolute!

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:41.451
My God! It's a B-1!

01:12:41.489 --> 01:12:44.014
- 52!
- Out of my way!

01:13:12.687 --> 01:13:14.120
Son of a bitch!

01:13:15.924 --> 01:13:17.186
Shit!

01:13:20.895 --> 01:13:22.055
Goddamn!

01:13:28.536 --> 01:13:31.130
That goddamn son of a bitch!

01:13:33.174 --> 01:13:35.404
I'll shoot your damn ass, boy!

01:13:35.443 --> 01:13:38.139
I'm going to shoot
your damn ass!

01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:47.612
Get back! Get back here!

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:56.063
Son of a bitch! God damn it!

01:13:56.097 --> 01:13:59.589
God damn it! Get back here!

01:15:12.740 --> 01:15:14.605
Oh, God.

01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:28.885
All those chances, I mean...

01:15:28.923 --> 01:15:31.585
Hey, don't think about it.

01:15:31.626 --> 01:15:34.117
Oh, God.

01:15:38.399 --> 01:15:41.368
It's hell out there now,
isn't it?

01:15:41.402 --> 01:15:43.063
Just blot it out.

01:15:46.574 --> 01:15:49.543
If you weren't in here
with me...

01:15:49.577 --> 01:15:51.568
that would be hell.

01:15:57.085 --> 01:15:59.019
People are going
to help each other, won't they?

01:15:59.053 --> 01:16:02.682
I mean, rebuilding things.

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:04.624
The survivors, I mean.

01:16:08.296 --> 01:16:11.094
I think it's the insects' turn.

01:16:17.071 --> 01:16:21.440
All your life, you think you
have time to do everything...

01:16:21.476 --> 01:16:23.103
and then it just...

01:16:45.466 --> 01:16:47.491
Is that it?

01:16:47.535 --> 01:16:50.527
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:16:50.571 --> 01:16:53.472
I'm so scared.

01:16:53.508 --> 01:16:55.203
We won't feel a thing.

01:17:02.450 --> 01:17:05.715
And we'll be together,
won't we?

01:17:05.753 --> 01:17:07.584
And when it comes...

01:17:09.090 --> 01:17:12.287
wherever we are, I mean...

01:17:12.327 --> 01:17:14.522
even if our atoms are...

01:17:14.562 --> 01:17:17.053
I mean our spirits
will be together.

01:17:17.098 --> 01:17:18.793
- Yes.
- Right?

01:17:27.108 --> 01:17:29.099
There's no more words...

01:17:31.112 --> 01:17:32.602
except I love you.

01:18:14.922 --> 01:18:17.584
God!
I wish I had some window pane.

01:18:20.595 --> 01:18:23.564
And I ate the drugstore.

01:18:23.598 --> 01:18:26.567
Oh, Nellie,
them perks are a perkin'.

01:18:26.601 --> 01:18:30.469
And all that other stuff.
It all mixes in your tummy.

01:18:30.505 --> 01:18:32.564
Mama always said...

01:18:32.607 --> 01:18:34.905
I wasn't sure
I'd get off in time, but...

01:18:39.347 --> 01:18:41.372
Man, that better not have just
been the fucking earthquake.

01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:43.577
If I went and fried my brain
over an earthquake...

01:18:43.618 --> 01:18:45.381
Shit!

01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:47.786
Landa!

01:18:47.822 --> 01:18:49.756
You slut! Why didn't I listen?

01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:55.093
I could be out fucking penguins
with Jacques Cousteau.

01:18:55.129 --> 01:18:58.121
Baron Lafitte-Rothschild '28.

01:18:58.166 --> 01:19:00.191
Not any corkscrew in sight.

01:19:05.139 --> 01:19:07.903
Tastes like shit!

01:19:09.744 --> 01:19:11.507
Holy cock-sucking
mother of Christ!

01:19:11.546 --> 01:19:12.706
There's the first
son of a bitch right now!

01:19:12.747 --> 01:19:13.907
See what I see?

01:19:25.159 --> 01:19:27.923
Look at that baby go!

01:19:27.962 --> 01:19:31.557
It's going all the way
to Tia-fucking-juana!

01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:02.623
Run!

01:20:08.336 --> 01:20:10.099
Let's go!

01:20:10.138 --> 01:20:11.935
I said I'd be here.

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:13.406
Can we make it?

01:20:14.475 --> 01:20:15.635
We'll make it.

01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:01.855
The E.M.P.
Blew out the controls.

01:21:05.626 --> 01:21:07.856
There's nowhere to go.

01:21:59.547 --> 01:22:01.572
No! I don't want this!

01:22:01.616 --> 01:22:03.083
I can't do this!

01:22:03.117 --> 01:22:06.086
You don't want to go out there.

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.384
I don't want to die like this.

01:22:08.422 --> 01:22:10.652
I don't want this!

01:22:13.828 --> 01:22:15.420
There's nothing up there.

01:22:17.131 --> 01:22:18.598
I don't want this.

01:22:18.633 --> 01:22:20.430
I don't want it.

01:22:30.611 --> 01:22:32.738
They'll find us here someday.

01:22:37.151 --> 01:22:39.551
They'll put us in the museum.

01:22:46.193 --> 01:22:49.526
Maybe we'll get a direct hit.

01:22:49.563 --> 01:22:52.225
It will metamorphosize us.

01:22:52.266 --> 01:22:54.530
Superman,
he can take a lump of coal...

01:22:54.568 --> 01:22:57.731
and he'd squeeze it,
and it would make a diamond.

01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:05.578
Diamonds...

01:23:05.613 --> 01:23:07.604
you and me, Harry.

01:23:11.619 --> 01:23:13.450
You and me.

01:23:17.224 --> 01:23:19.124
Diamonds.
