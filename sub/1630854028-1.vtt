01:37.099 --> 01:38.299
<i>Okay, are you ready?</i>

01:39.134 --> 01:40.334
<i>I guess.</i>

01:41.036 --> 01:42.037
<i>And speeding.</i>

01:43.005 --> 01:44.907
<i>What's that?</i>

01:44.940 --> 01:46.350
<i>I want to start
with some questions.</i>

01:46.374 --> 01:47.375
<i>Oh, got it.</i>

01:49.077 --> 01:50.112
<i>Is it hard for you?</i>

01:50.145 --> 01:52.413
<i>Has it been hard
for you since...</i>

01:52.446 --> 01:54.750
<i>Mmm...</i>

01:54.783 --> 01:57.652
<i>Not in the way that I think you
would think it would be, but...</i>

02:00.756 --> 02:03.591
<i>Uh, it's pretty much
common knowledge</i>

02:03.624 --> 02:05.526
<i>that it takes at least 20 shells</i>

02:05.560 --> 02:06.627
<i>to have a community.</i>

02:09.064 --> 02:11.800
<i>That that's about the minimum
that you need to survive, so...</i>

02:11.834 --> 02:13.135
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:13.168 --> 02:14.236
<i>I think at first</i>

02:14.269 --> 02:16.637
<i>I was thinking
we're not gonna make it.</i>

02:23.078 --> 02:25.747
<i>But sometimes you just have
to disregard those rules</i>

02:25.781 --> 02:27.058
<i>and think, "Well, actually,
the rule is</i>

02:27.082 --> 02:28.917
<i>"that I want to be
having a good life</i>

02:28.951 --> 02:30.484
<i>"and stay alive, and...</i>

02:31.720 --> 02:34.022
<i>And not just survive,
but have a good life.</i>

02:38.459 --> 02:40.661
Tell me about
what's life like now?

02:40.695 --> 02:44.166
It... Me? Uh...

02:44.199 --> 02:46.434
<i>I appreciate
its different beauties,</i>

02:46.467 --> 02:49.437
<i>but it... it's not the way
I would've done things</i>

02:49.470 --> 02:50.839
<i>if I was still in the group.</i>

02:52.473 --> 02:55.576
<i>But they're not here.</i>

02:55.610 --> 02:59.014
<i>So, that's why I have
the electric mixer.</i>

02:59.047 --> 03:00.514
- Ready?
- Mmm-hmm.

03:09.992 --> 03:11.894
Ta-da!

03:11.927 --> 03:13.437
I mean,
I don't want my voice in it.

03:13.461 --> 03:14.695
Well, that's up to you.

03:14.730 --> 03:15.940
So, stop asking me
questions is what I'm saying.

03:15.964 --> 03:17.799
Oh! Oh, okay.

03:17.833 --> 03:19.835
Do your parents work?
Have you ever met a chef?

03:19.868 --> 03:20.945
What happens if you break this?

03:20.969 --> 03:22.213
Have you ever eaten a raspberry?

03:22.237 --> 03:25.073
Um, and what was that like?

03:25.107 --> 03:26.742
Are you gonna ask me questions?

03:30.045 --> 03:31.046
Hello?

03:32.781 --> 03:34.783
Oh, man, this is weird.

03:34.816 --> 03:35.650
I don't want
my voice in it.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.219
How am I supposed
to ask you questions?

03:38.486 --> 03:41.857
<i>There are actually
only two of us now.</i>

03:43.524 --> 03:44.592
<i>Myself...</i>

03:45.593 --> 03:48.629
<i>and my grandmother, Nana Connie.</i>

03:53.135 --> 03:54.779
<i>Back when the man
and the woman lived here,</i>

03:54.803 --> 03:56.238
<i>there were a lot of us.</i>

03:56.271 --> 03:59.207
<i>More sounds and smells</i>

03:59.241 --> 04:02.077
<i>and, uh, things to say</i>

04:02.110 --> 04:04.079
<i>'cause there were
more people to talk to.</i>

04:08.516 --> 04:10.685
- There... A stage.
- All right!

04:10.719 --> 04:12.120
Ah! Up.

04:12.988 --> 04:14.823
<i>These days, it's quieter.</i>

04:28.103 --> 04:29.938
Rolling.
Give me some levels.

04:29.972 --> 04:33.607
Give... Give you some levels?
Like...

04:33.641 --> 04:36.912
Just, like,
talk a little bit.
Like, oh, uh...

04:36.945 --> 04:39.547
- Hello, my name is...
- Darn it.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.283
It's not the first time
I've done that.

04:41.316 --> 04:42.417
My name is Marcel,

04:42.451 --> 04:46.288
and I'm partially a shell
as you can see on my body,

04:46.321 --> 04:50.726
but I also have shoes,

04:50.759 --> 04:53.929
and, um, a face.

04:53.962 --> 04:57.866
So, I like that about myself,
and I like myself,

04:57.899 --> 05:00.869
and I have a lot of
other great qualities as well.

05:00.902 --> 05:02.636
That was perfect.
Okay.

05:04.906 --> 05:07.109
Is this
the wild tone right now?

05:07.142 --> 05:09.177
- Yes.
- Ugh.

05:09.211 --> 05:11.079
Just stay still
for 30 seconds.

05:14.282 --> 05:15.649
How long you gonna...

05:15.683 --> 05:17.228
What are you trying to do
with all this?

05:17.252 --> 05:18.787
Um...

05:18.820 --> 05:20.231
I'm making, like,
a little documentary

05:20.255 --> 05:21.790
that I might put online.

05:21.823 --> 05:24.159
- Online?
- Yeah.

05:24.192 --> 05:25.727
Eh, you lost me.

05:27.129 --> 05:28.130
Ugh.

05:29.831 --> 05:32.666
Are you okay?
Itchy. Are you recording?

05:32.701 --> 05:33.735
Yeah.
Right now?

05:33.769 --> 05:34.903
Yeah.
Oh.

05:34.936 --> 05:36.637
Well, what should I be doing?

05:36.670 --> 05:37.906
Just, well, don't do anything.

05:37.939 --> 05:39.350
Just do whatever
you'd normally be doing,

05:39.374 --> 05:40.674
like if I weren't here.

05:54.823 --> 05:56.058
Where'd you
get the rope?

05:56.091 --> 05:59.327
This?
Uh, It... I... I'll show you.

05:59.361 --> 06:01.763
I come to the bathroom,
I get these curly hairs.

06:01.797 --> 06:03.365
They're the strongest

06:03.398 --> 06:05.133
'cause you have to uncurl it,

06:05.167 --> 06:07.803
but, um, then you can see
it's really long and strong.

06:07.836 --> 06:09.805
But...

06:09.838 --> 06:11.638
Hey, what are you laughing at?

06:13.842 --> 06:16.078
We call 'em hardy hairs.

06:16.111 --> 06:17.946
<i>This is the arboretum,</i>

06:17.979 --> 06:21.216
<i>a collection of trees
that a community keeps alive,</i>

06:21.249 --> 06:22.393
but I do like to talk to them,

06:22.417 --> 06:23.651
and plants like to have

06:23.684 --> 06:25.320
classical music played for them.

06:25.353 --> 06:28.390
<i>Mozart and Brahms,
it helps them grow faster.</i>

06:28.423 --> 06:30.258
This is my bread room.

06:30.292 --> 06:32.094
Uh, it's a bedroom,

06:32.127 --> 06:33.995
but I sleep on a piece of bread,

06:34.029 --> 06:35.263
so I...

06:35.297 --> 06:36.865
Whoa, sorry.
He's just saying hi.

06:36.898 --> 06:38.366
<i>I actually</i>

06:38.400 --> 06:40.711
<i>like the concept
of having a dog.</i>

06:40.735 --> 06:42.871
Oh, God, I can smell his face.

06:42.904 --> 06:45.974
But I just tie a hair
to a piece of lint,

06:46.007 --> 06:47.342
and I drag it around.

06:47.375 --> 06:48.877
I love you.

06:48.910 --> 06:51.813
Come on. Come on.
That's it.

06:51.847 --> 06:53.348
<i>Sometimes, people say</i>

06:53.381 --> 06:56.051
that my head is too big
for my body.

06:56.084 --> 06:58.987
And then I say,
"Compared to what?"

06:59.020 --> 07:01.790
Sometimes, if I don't have
a way to itch my itch,

07:01.823 --> 07:03.925
the only thing I can do is
I just stand there.

07:03.959 --> 07:06.660
I just let it get me
and I just...

07:06.694 --> 07:08.130
I just have to scream it out.

07:22.010 --> 07:23.411
He's your best friend?

07:25.080 --> 07:26.647
Don't you know any other

07:28.216 --> 07:29.851
guys or...

07:31.486 --> 07:32.754
Cool.

07:38.059 --> 07:40.061
Hmm. I never get it
the first time.

07:45.967 --> 07:47.002
Nope.

07:49.938 --> 07:50.939
Oh, dang it.

07:55.977 --> 07:57.913
Oh! Go, go, go!

07:57.946 --> 08:00.048
Boom! There it is.

08:01.883 --> 08:04.186
You miss a 100% of the shots
you don't take.

08:05.086 --> 08:06.121
Wow.
That's a quote.

08:06.154 --> 08:07.122
I didn't make that up.

08:07.155 --> 08:10.458
It's by a famous sports player
named Wayde...

08:11.326 --> 08:13.328
Wayde Gansdy...

08:13.361 --> 08:14.429
What is it?

08:14.462 --> 08:15.797
Ways...

08:16.298 --> 08:18.333
Way... Whale...

08:18.366 --> 08:20.068
Whale Gensky.

08:20.101 --> 08:21.870
Are you thinking of Wayne...
Gensky. Whale...

08:21.903 --> 08:23.247
Wayne...
Could that be his name?

08:23.271 --> 08:24.406
Whale Jetski?

08:24.439 --> 08:25.774
No.
No?

08:27.108 --> 08:29.144
- Wake... Lake... Jake?
- Well...

08:30.278 --> 08:31.780
Wayne Jet... Jet... Get...

08:31.813 --> 08:33.982
This is my stockpile.

08:34.015 --> 08:36.117
All right,
so, we got your basics here.

08:36.151 --> 08:39.287
I got couple of almonds.
I have a dozen peanuts.

08:39.321 --> 08:40.755
It's basically your dry goods.

08:40.789 --> 08:42.524
You got a craisin
with the raisins,

08:42.557 --> 08:44.326
but the craisin sits to the side

08:44.359 --> 08:46.861
because it is a treat. Uh...

08:46.895 --> 08:48.263
Is...
Is this an inhaler?

08:50.599 --> 08:52.500
It's like... It's like a slide
or something...

08:52.534 --> 08:53.844
Like, I don't even actually
know what it this is.

08:53.868 --> 08:54.979
Where did you get that from?

08:55.003 --> 08:57.906
From one of the people
that stayed here for a night.

08:57.939 --> 09:00.175
Why?
Did you take anything from me?

09:00.208 --> 09:01.209
Mmm...

09:05.046 --> 09:06.214
What is wrong with you?

09:06.248 --> 09:07.415
I didn't know.

09:07.449 --> 09:08.526
<i>Give me that.
I didn't know what it was.</i>

09:08.550 --> 09:10.394
So, these are
all the parts put together.

09:10.418 --> 09:12.287
Mmm-hmm.
And then now what?

09:12.320 --> 09:13.364
I'm gonna put it
on the Internet,

09:13.388 --> 09:14.889
and people can watch it.
Oh.

09:16.424 --> 09:17.993
Oh, no.

09:18.026 --> 09:19.928
Your soda can is almost empty.

09:21.263 --> 09:22.797
Whoa.

09:22.831 --> 09:24.132
Sorry.
Hold on one second.

09:24.165 --> 09:25.800
All right.

09:25.834 --> 09:26.978
I don't know
why you would...

09:27.002 --> 09:28.246
What... What is
cleaning the house

09:28.270 --> 09:29.838
if all she does is
move things around,

09:29.871 --> 09:31.406
and disturb
the entire environment?

09:31.439 --> 09:33.351
She doesn't.
She's doing dishes right now.

09:33.375 --> 09:36.111
She's the harbinger
of the vacuum.

09:36.144 --> 09:37.188
I can't tell her
to go home.

09:37.212 --> 09:38.422
I mean, that's her
scheduled cleaning.

09:38.446 --> 09:39.547
But why?
She was hired

09:39.581 --> 09:43.018
by the lady that is, like,
the Airbnb host.

09:43.051 --> 09:46.021
What? The...
Airbnb?

09:46.054 --> 09:48.056
Mmm, what is Airbb?
To clean.

09:48.089 --> 09:50.191
Oh, that's you! Oh, who's she?

09:50.225 --> 09:51.993
Oh... I don't...

09:52.027 --> 09:53.328
Oh, wow, wait, what?

09:53.361 --> 09:55.497
That's outside of here.
Yeah.

09:55.530 --> 09:57.165
Somehow, this has kind of turned

09:57.198 --> 09:59.167
into like a computer hotel?

09:59.200 --> 10:01.069
Sort of, yeah.
Why did you decide...

10:01.102 --> 10:02.304
Why are you here?

10:02.337 --> 10:03.881
I had to move
out of my old place,

10:03.905 --> 10:05.840
so I'm staying here
until I find a new one.

10:05.874 --> 10:07.075
Why did you have to move out?

10:07.108 --> 10:08.343
Uh, that's personal.

10:09.210 --> 10:10.545
Okay.

10:10.578 --> 10:12.356
You never talked to anyone
who stayed here before?

10:12.380 --> 10:13.915
Eh...

10:13.948 --> 10:15.216
People don't usually notice us.

10:15.250 --> 10:17.085
Aw, dang it.

10:17.118 --> 10:18.486
I got to go check on Nana Connie

10:18.520 --> 10:20.288
if this lady's gonna
be running the vacuum.

10:21.956 --> 10:24.326
This is the rover. Ow!

10:24.359 --> 10:26.861
It's a good thing I don't,
like, "care" care

10:26.895 --> 10:29.464
about this car because I can't

10:29.497 --> 10:30.541
figure out
where I'm going in this thing.

10:30.565 --> 10:32.534
Oops, what was that? Sorry.

10:32.567 --> 10:35.103
No, no, no. Arthur.

10:35.136 --> 10:37.372
Hopefully, she's right
around the corner here.

10:37.405 --> 10:40.575
And there she is.

10:41.676 --> 10:43.178
That's a load off.

10:43.211 --> 10:44.946
Can you just wait here
for one sec

10:44.979 --> 10:47.515
because I do think that
with you and with the camera,

10:47.549 --> 10:49.050
- it's just I... That I...
- Okay.

10:49.084 --> 10:50.518
I just want to warn her. Yeah.
Okay.

10:50.552 --> 10:52.654
Brown head-hair,
and he has glasses.

10:52.687 --> 10:53.765
You want me to leave?

10:53.789 --> 10:56.191
No, no, no, no, no! I want you
to stay is what I...

10:56.224 --> 10:57.058
- Yeah.
- Just careful

10:57.092 --> 10:58.269
- where you step.
- Yeah, I know.

10:58.293 --> 11:00.471
- I just brought him by.
- You're making what?

11:00.495 --> 11:01.629
A documentary.

11:04.432 --> 11:05.476
It's like...
Oh, it's like a movie,

11:05.500 --> 11:06.568
but nobody has any lines,

11:06.601 --> 11:08.036
and nobody even knows what it is

11:08.069 --> 11:09.070
while they're making it.

11:09.571 --> 11:11.606
Mmm...
No?

11:11.639 --> 11:13.017
That's sort of a way
to put it, yeah.

11:13.041 --> 11:15.410
No, I just am making
a little video portrait.

11:15.443 --> 11:17.145
- About Marcel?
- Yeah.

11:17.178 --> 11:18.947
- A... A film?
- Uh, yeah.

11:18.980 --> 11:21.116
It's like the truth, kind of.
It's a...

11:21.149 --> 11:22.550
And it's the truth about Marcel?

11:22.584 --> 11:23.627
I mean, I hope so.

11:23.651 --> 11:25.086
I guess he could really spin it,

11:25.120 --> 11:26.621
and make me look like a total...

11:26.654 --> 11:28.032
So, this is your garden
out here, huh?

11:28.056 --> 11:29.224
- Yes.
- Beautiful.

11:29.257 --> 11:31.126
Thank you.
Thank you for the aromas.

11:31.159 --> 11:33.328
<i>My house
was very popular.</i>

11:33.361 --> 11:35.697
<i>I had lots of friends.</i>

11:35.731 --> 11:37.565
<i>And if you told me then,</i>

11:37.599 --> 11:39.267
<i>many years ago,</i>

11:39.300 --> 11:42.404
<i>that I would've spent
so much time in a garden,</i>

11:42.437 --> 11:44.072
<i>I would've said,
"Are you kidding?"</i>

11:44.105 --> 11:45.507
Okay, you see these ones?

11:45.540 --> 11:47.442
You can feel them.

11:47.475 --> 11:48.510
They're not quite ripe,

11:48.543 --> 11:49.944
but in a few days,
they would be.

11:49.978 --> 11:51.446
<i>It wasn't easy.</i>

11:52.547 --> 11:54.482
<i>I didn't know anything
about farming.</i>

11:56.484 --> 11:58.553
<i>Because when the couple
still lived here,</i>

11:58.586 --> 12:00.422
<i>there was always food.</i>

12:00.455 --> 12:02.557
<i>In the pantry, in the kitchen,</i>

12:02.590 --> 12:04.626
<i>there were stacks
here and there.</i>

12:06.594 --> 12:08.314
<i>But when they went away</i>

12:10.598 --> 12:11.599
<i>the food disappeared.</i>

12:13.468 --> 12:16.237
<i>So, I had to taught myself
how to farm.</i>

12:18.373 --> 12:21.109
"Planting, harvesting..."

12:21.142 --> 12:23.178
<i>She's always been
a pretty tough cookie.</i>

12:23.211 --> 12:25.280
<i>Everything has a function
with her.</i>

12:25.313 --> 12:28.751
<i>There's no one button
that's there for decoration.</i>

12:28.784 --> 12:29.795
<i>- You know what I mean?
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

12:29.819 --> 12:31.286
<i>She's just
like a backhoe.</i>

12:34.489 --> 12:36.725
<i>But I will say you can
really see her tender side</i>

12:36.759 --> 12:38.259
<i>when she's working
with the bugs.</i>

12:39.027 --> 12:40.061
<i>Is she okay?</i>

12:40.094 --> 12:41.262
Yeah, she's okay,

12:41.296 --> 12:43.164
she's a little loopy.

12:43.198 --> 12:46.735
She had a little bit too much,
uh, nectar.

12:46.769 --> 12:49.604
<i>Vino fiore, right, Franny?</i>

12:49.637 --> 12:51.774
<i>My community
found the bugs</i>

12:51.807 --> 12:55.143
<i>to be deeply unlikeable.</i>

12:55.176 --> 12:57.245
Okay, we'll put her
here in the sun.

12:57.278 --> 12:58.656
And in a few seconds,
she'll be dry.

12:58.680 --> 13:01.082
<i>But Connie's
made friends with many of them,</i>

13:01.115 --> 13:03.651
<i>and in return, they actually
help her with the gardening.</i>

13:03.685 --> 13:05.029
At first,
found them a little yucky

13:05.053 --> 13:06.321
but now I see their beauty.

13:06.354 --> 13:07.322
I cannot
stand this thing.

13:07.355 --> 13:09.324
Because they turn the soil,
they break it...

13:09.357 --> 13:11.092
It's wonderful to have them.

13:11.125 --> 13:13.294
His whole body looks
like his pants are off.

13:15.798 --> 13:17.031
<i>It reminds me</i>

13:17.065 --> 13:19.267
<i>of Whoopi Goldberg
in Sister Act,</i>

13:19.300 --> 13:21.035
<i>how she helps them
to do graffiti</i>

13:21.069 --> 13:23.404
in a meaningful way
or something, and...

13:23.438 --> 13:24.606
Oh, there she goes.

13:26.274 --> 13:27.551
- Oops!
- Ow, ow, ow.

13:27.575 --> 13:29.477
She's gone.

13:29.511 --> 13:31.513
Uh, sort of.

13:32.313 --> 13:33.348
Oh, wow.

13:35.083 --> 13:37.018
What is, uh...
What is this?

13:37.853 --> 13:39.320
- Hmm?
- What's that?

13:39.354 --> 13:41.689
What are you doing now
with Marcel?

13:41.724 --> 13:43.591
Oh, I'm making a movie.

13:46.394 --> 13:47.763
Uh...
A documentary.

13:47.796 --> 13:49.397
- About Marcel?
- Yeah.

13:49.430 --> 13:51.800
A documentary? Uh, a film?

13:51.834 --> 13:53.434
Yeah.

13:53.468 --> 13:54.837
Ah, Marcel.
You remember, Nan,

13:54.870 --> 13:56.304
we were just talking about it.

13:56.337 --> 13:57.372
It's a movie,

13:57.405 --> 13:58.449
and we're doing it
together, but...

13:58.473 --> 14:00.184
- what I just said before.
- That's what you...

14:00.208 --> 14:02.210
And we just joked about it.

14:02.243 --> 14:03.554
- Yes.
- It's the truth,

14:03.578 --> 14:04.813
<i>but it's the truth about me...</i>

14:10.251 --> 14:14.289
<i>She has lost
a small piece...</i>

14:14.322 --> 14:16.357
<i>of a very large puzzle.</i>

14:18.192 --> 14:19.193
Nan!

14:22.230 --> 14:23.331
Nana!

14:23.364 --> 14:25.366
<i>Once or twice a week,
I'll find her in here,</i>

14:25.400 --> 14:27.368
<i>snoozing in
the laundry basket and...</i>

14:27.402 --> 14:28.747
Is it bad for her
to be in here?

14:28.771 --> 14:30.839
Yeah, it's not
the safest place to be.

14:33.876 --> 14:36.745
You know, my cousin
fell asleep in a pocket,

14:36.779 --> 14:39.280
and that's why
I don't like the saying,

14:39.314 --> 14:41.115
"Everything comes out
in the wash,"

14:41.149 --> 14:42.785
because sometimes it doesn't.

14:42.818 --> 14:43.919
Or sometimes it does,

14:43.953 --> 14:46.387
and they're just like
a completely different person.

14:47.856 --> 14:48.724
'Cause after that,

14:48.757 --> 14:50.167
my cousin would
just sit by the window

14:50.191 --> 14:52.126
and wait for fire trucks
to go by.

14:57.632 --> 14:59.768
<i>Guess what I use
to tie my skis to my car.</i>

14:59.802 --> 15:01.502
<i>What?
A hair.</i>

15:01.536 --> 15:02.570
<i>Guess what my...</i>

15:02.604 --> 15:03.504
MARCEL THE SHELL WITH SHOES ON

15:03.538 --> 15:05.340
<i>Guess...
Guess what my skis are.</i>

15:05.373 --> 15:07.743
<i>What?
Toe nails from a man.</i>

15:07.776 --> 15:09.310
Wait, hold on.

15:09.344 --> 15:11.814
So, you're telling me that
84 different people have

15:11.847 --> 15:12.915
just watched?

15:12.948 --> 15:14.282
Yeah, isn't that cool?
Yeah.

15:14.315 --> 15:16.651
I mean... Geez.

15:16.684 --> 15:17.720
What?

15:17.753 --> 15:20.521
Just... Wow.

15:20.555 --> 15:21.900
<i>What do you
do when you get bored?</i>

15:21.924 --> 15:23.458
<i>Uh, I move around.</i>

15:23.491 --> 15:25.360
<i>♪ You really gotta
move, move it</i>

15:25.393 --> 15:26.929
<i>♪ You really gotta groove it</i>

15:26.962 --> 15:29.564
<i>♪ Taking that time
to let yourself</i>

15:29.597 --> 15:30.833
<i>♪ Lose it ♪</i>

15:32.367 --> 15:34.511
<i>I could tell
he's performing
a little bit for you,</i>

15:34.535 --> 15:36.537
- you know?
- Mmm-hmm.

15:36.571 --> 15:38.941
Da, da, da, da.
You're giving him a stage.

15:38.974 --> 15:40.551
It's good for him.

15:40.575 --> 15:41.695
<i>One, two...</i>

15:42.577 --> 15:45.413
<i>♪ Mmm
I want to linger</i>

15:45.446 --> 15:47.649
<i>♪ Mmm, a little longer</i>

15:47.682 --> 15:50.585
<i>♪ Mmm, a little longer here
with you...</i>

15:50.618 --> 15:52.897
The stage makes him feel good.

15:52.921 --> 15:55.423
Playful. He needs that.

15:56.557 --> 15:58.761
<i>♪ Mmm, and as the years go by</i>

15:58.794 --> 16:00.929
<i>♪ Mmm, I'll think of you
and sigh</i>

16:00.963 --> 16:03.932
<i>♪ Mmm, that it's so long
and not goodbye ♪</i>

16:05.868 --> 16:07.335
He hasn't been able to get that

16:07.368 --> 16:09.170
since the others
were taken from us.

16:15.543 --> 16:17.703
Okay, so do you just want me
to start at the beginning?

16:21.016 --> 16:24.318
<i>I don't actually know
how it started,</i>

16:24.352 --> 16:27.723
<i>but the man and the woman
started to yell at each other</i>

16:27.756 --> 16:29.825
<i>more often than they would
talk to each other.</i>

16:34.462 --> 16:37.331
<i>You'd just hear
these big noises from the sky,</i>

16:37.365 --> 16:41.536
<i>and my cousin's house
fell down this one time</i>

16:41.569 --> 16:43.872
<i>when the office door
got slammed.</i>

16:51.312 --> 16:53.816
<i>We started
to have a shelter plan.</i>

16:53.849 --> 16:55.918
<i>We all go to the sock drawer,</i>

16:56.952 --> 16:59.021
<i>and so everyone
will be safe there.</i>

17:00.823 --> 17:02.256
<i>This was a Sunday,</i>

17:02.290 --> 17:03.524
<i>and everybody gets together,</i>

17:03.558 --> 17:06.762
<i>and we all watch 60 Minutes
as a community.</i>

17:06.795 --> 17:08.030
<i>60 Minutes, the...</i>

17:08.063 --> 17:10.631
Yeah. So, this is
where we were...

17:10.665 --> 17:12.385
<i>- And...
- Every week, all of you?</i>

17:13.334 --> 17:14.502
Yeah. We love it.

17:14.535 --> 17:16.547
We just call it "The show."
That's how much we love it.

17:16.571 --> 17:17.638
Lesley.

17:17.672 --> 17:19.474
Who's Lesley?
Lesley Show.

17:20.075 --> 17:21.642
She likes Lesley Stahl.

17:21.676 --> 17:22.577
<i>I'm Lesley Stahl...</i>

17:22.610 --> 17:23.888
<i>She blows cases wide open,</i>

17:23.912 --> 17:25.646
<i>and she's got class.</i>

17:25.680 --> 17:26.749
<i>Tonight on 60 Minutes.</i>

17:27.983 --> 17:29.283
<i>But...</i>

17:29.317 --> 17:30.962
<i>We could tell
that something was the matter</i>

17:30.986 --> 17:32.921
because the clock
started ticking...

17:34.689 --> 17:35.800
<i>and it was just
the two of us there.</i>

17:35.824 --> 17:38.659
<i>It was a big one.</i>

17:39.995 --> 17:40.996
<i>And we had...</i>

17:41.864 --> 17:43.431
<i>We had no warning.</i>

17:46.034 --> 17:47.936
<i>What we think is that</i>

17:49.004 --> 17:49.972
<i>everybody scooted</i>

17:50.005 --> 17:52.473
<i>into the sock drawer, and, uh...</i>

17:52.507 --> 17:54.777
<i>And the man just...</i>

17:54.810 --> 17:56.511
<i>dumped all the drawers
into a suitcase.</i>

18:02.084 --> 18:03.384
<i>And then he left.</i>

18:11.459 --> 18:13.427
<i>And that's...
That's how they got moved.</i>

18:15.097 --> 18:16.664
<i>I...</i>

18:16.697 --> 18:17.966
<i>Oh...</i>

18:18.000 --> 18:19.760
Do you want a tissue?

18:20.501 --> 18:21.502
Yeah.

18:23.504 --> 18:26.008
Do you mind if I just
plop into it real quick?

18:26.041 --> 18:27.042
Sure.

18:33.648 --> 18:35.784
Shoot.

18:35.818 --> 18:37.351
This can be
our last thing.

18:37.385 --> 18:39.087
Okay.

18:40.488 --> 18:43.826
<i>It's always what they say
on the days</i>

18:43.859 --> 18:44.893
<i>when you have</i>

18:45.928 --> 18:48.964
<i>a really keen sense
of being lost</i>

18:48.997 --> 18:50.799
<i>or losing something,</i>

18:50.833 --> 18:52.868
<i>that it...</i>

18:52.901 --> 18:55.603
<i>It often feels like
the sun shines the brightest.</i>

18:56.171 --> 18:57.405
<i>And then the next day,</i>

18:57.438 --> 19:00.374
<i>there was a really sunny day
with a good breeze.</i>

19:00.408 --> 19:02.978
<i>And I just remember thinking,</i>

19:03.846 --> 19:04.847
<i>"if I was somebody else,</i>

19:04.880 --> 19:06.748
<i>"I would really be
enjoying this."</i>

19:06.782 --> 19:07.783
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

19:21.864 --> 19:23.832
Whoa! Geez.

19:31.907 --> 19:34.042
Okay, here it is.

19:41.049 --> 19:42.994
So, tell me a little bit
about who you put on here.

19:43.018 --> 19:44.652
I put,
first and foremost,

19:44.685 --> 19:46.989
my parents, Catherine and Mario,

19:47.022 --> 19:48.556
next to each other with a heart.

19:50.859 --> 19:53.128
My brother is here and here...

19:53.161 --> 19:56.564
and I put my music teacher,
The Maestro.

20:01.970 --> 20:03.939
Wow!
Yeah!

20:03.972 --> 20:05.616
I love that one,
it sounds like Taps.

20:05.640 --> 20:06.875
Do you know that?

20:06.909 --> 20:08.710
Yeah. Do you want
to hear Taps?

20:08.744 --> 20:10.746
Sure.

20:20.956 --> 20:21.990
<i>Do you feel angry?</i>

20:23.258 --> 20:24.335
<i>Uh, I just feel angry</i>

20:24.359 --> 20:25.994
<i>that we didn't have
a better goodbye.</i>

20:27.229 --> 20:28.964
<i>Who would you
say goodbye to?</i>

20:28.997 --> 20:30.464
<i>I'd like to say goodbye</i>

20:30.498 --> 20:32.633
<i>to my neighbors, the Costas.</i>

20:32.667 --> 20:34.836
Goodbye, the Costas,

20:34.870 --> 20:37.105
even though we had
a language barrier.

20:37.139 --> 20:38.506
You were my neighbors.

20:38.539 --> 20:40.876
You always liked to garden.

20:40.909 --> 20:44.079
Goodbye, Richard, you were
the worst singer in our class,

20:44.112 --> 20:46.580
but I loved how you let me
cut you in line.

20:46.614 --> 20:48.549
Goodbye, Anka,

20:48.582 --> 20:51.153
your sense of timing
is one of the worst.

20:51.186 --> 20:54.056
Bye, Sandra,
you were my favorite author.

20:54.089 --> 20:55.757
Goodbye, Mrs. Kim.

20:55.791 --> 20:57.859
The time that you ate
a pepper flake

20:57.893 --> 20:59.895
and it made you fly
into the wall

20:59.928 --> 21:03.031
was one of the funniest
yet most serious accidents

21:03.065 --> 21:04.766
any of us ever witnessed,

21:04.800 --> 21:07.869
and you bore it
with great grace and bravery.

21:07.903 --> 21:09.271
Goodbye, Brad.

21:09.304 --> 21:10.272
Thank you so much

21:10.305 --> 21:13.275
for rolling that marble
into my bread room.

21:13.308 --> 21:15.210
<i>I still keep it to this day.</i>

21:21.283 --> 21:24.186
Yep. And that...
And there they all are.

21:34.062 --> 21:36.530
- Guess why I smile a lot.
- Why?

21:36.564 --> 21:38.200
Uh, 'cause it's worth it.

22:01.056 --> 22:04.993
Um...
Uh, whatcha doing?

22:06.128 --> 22:07.996
Looking for apartments.

22:10.631 --> 22:13.001
So, do you have
any plans tonight?

22:14.236 --> 22:15.804
No.

22:20.742 --> 22:23.178
I'm gonna...

22:23.211 --> 22:25.646
- Give me that.
- No! No!

22:35.357 --> 22:37.625
<i>Whoa.
Marcel, look at this.</i>

22:40.862 --> 22:43.031
It... Aren't I...
Wait. Is this normal for you?

22:43.065 --> 22:44.208
No, this never happens.

22:44.232 --> 22:45.834
- It's so cool.
- 22 million?

22:45.867 --> 22:47.302
It's wonderful.

22:47.335 --> 22:50.604
Yeah, it's, uh, broad...
Broad spectrum of emotions.

22:50.638 --> 22:52.941
I didn't even know
there were that many people.

22:52.974 --> 22:54.018
Okay,
now jump really hard.

22:54.042 --> 22:56.211
<i>Have you guys seen
Marcel the Shell?</i>

22:56.244 --> 22:57.245
<i>It's a YouTube video.</i>

22:57.279 --> 22:59.014
<i>My name is Marcel,</i>

22:59.047 --> 23:00.614
<i>and I'm partially a shell.</i>

23:00.648 --> 23:02.026
<i>My name is Marcel,</i>

23:02.050 --> 23:04.853
<i>and I'm a shell as you can see
on my body, but...</i>

23:05.921 --> 23:07.655
Oh, so nice.

23:07.688 --> 23:08.733
<i>as a beanbag?</i>

23:09.825 --> 23:11.059
<i>A raisin.</i>

23:12.360 --> 23:14.628
<i>The wildly popular
online character,</i>

23:14.662 --> 23:16.064
<i>Marcel the Shell
With Shoes On...</i>

23:16.098 --> 23:17.132
<i>Marcel...</i>

23:17.165 --> 23:19.101
Marcel the Shell With Shoes On.

23:19.134 --> 23:21.870
"When the kush hit..."

23:23.038 --> 23:24.806
"Kush"? What is kush?

23:27.275 --> 23:29.144
I...
It goes so deep, and...

23:29.177 --> 23:30.212
They got tattoos.

23:30.245 --> 23:31.722
It's just
so many people, I...

23:31.746 --> 23:33.348
<i>I kind of regret this tattoo.</i>

23:33.381 --> 23:35.217
<i>Here it is.</i>

23:36.084 --> 23:38.153
<i>It's like a snail.</i>

23:38.186 --> 23:40.288
<i>Um, I just saw it online,</i>

23:40.322 --> 23:43.191
<i>but it was like super puffy
the day after,</i>

23:43.225 --> 23:44.259
<i>and I don't know why,</i>

23:44.292 --> 23:46.061
<i>and the tattoo guy
couldn't say why.</i>

23:46.094 --> 23:47.829
<i>And then,
a couple of months later,</i>

23:47.863 --> 23:48.997
<i>I found out that I...</i>

23:49.030 --> 23:50.899
<i>Today, I'm going to be
popping popcorn</i>

23:50.932 --> 23:52.710
<i>with a magnifying glass.
So right now we have...</i>

23:52.734 --> 23:53.945
<i>There's
all these people,</i>

23:53.969 --> 23:56.872
<i>and... And we're all
looking at the same thing,</i>

23:56.905 --> 23:59.007
<i>and we're all doing
the same thing.</i>

23:59.040 --> 24:01.109
<i>We're watching the guys...</i>

24:01.143 --> 24:03.411
<i>It's beautiful. And...
And it feels like...</i>

24:03.445 --> 24:04.946
<i>I don't even know
how to describe it.</i>

24:04.980 --> 24:07.082
<i>It feels like something.</i>

24:11.086 --> 24:13.155
Move, move, move!

24:13.188 --> 24:15.924
<i>It's really lovely.</i>

24:15.957 --> 24:18.226
Are you okay?
Yes, yes. I'm okay. I'm okay.

24:18.260 --> 24:20.204
So, are you
going to eat it?

24:20.228 --> 24:21.129
You can eat this stuff?

24:21.163 --> 24:23.832
Yeah, dude!
What does it taste like?

24:23.865 --> 24:24.942
Oh, my gosh,
you're gonna love it.

24:28.970 --> 24:30.272
So good, isn't it?

24:32.240 --> 24:33.842
<i>It's all been really fun,</i>

24:33.875 --> 24:35.944
<i>and having
all this happen, and...</i>

24:35.977 --> 24:38.013
<i>And, uh...</i>

24:38.046 --> 24:41.917
<i>You know, it's so big feeling,
and it's so nice.</i>

24:41.950 --> 24:42.951
<i>Um...</i>

24:46.388 --> 24:50.192
<i>Let it go! Let it go!</i>

24:52.360 --> 24:53.971
<i>The other part of it
is I think I find</i>

24:53.995 --> 24:58.266
<i>my mind wandering a bit
just thinking,</i>

24:58.300 --> 24:59.768
<i>what would my family think,</i>

25:01.770 --> 25:02.904
<i>and really noticing</i>

25:02.938 --> 25:04.482
<i>that they're not here
to share it with me.</i>

25:10.312 --> 25:12.747
<i>I do wonder what...</i>

25:13.381 --> 25:14.316
<i>What my dad would say,</i>

25:14.349 --> 25:17.852
<i>what my mom would say,
and, yeah...</i>

25:19.454 --> 25:21.056
<i>I think they'd like it a lot.</i>

25:33.568 --> 25:35.870
Oh! There she goes.

25:44.246 --> 25:45.814
Oh, beautiful.

25:46.248 --> 25:47.882
Hmm.

25:47.916 --> 25:50.418
There must be
so many others like me.

25:51.820 --> 25:53.097
It's impossible
that there wouldn't be,

25:53.121 --> 25:54.289
and not just my family.

25:56.124 --> 25:58.159
They're out there.

25:58.193 --> 25:59.993
Somewhere out there.

26:07.002 --> 26:10.438
Every time I do this,
that dog goes totally crazy.

26:15.176 --> 26:17.445
He sees something
truly elegant in the sky,

26:17.479 --> 26:19.047
and this is his reaction?

26:24.019 --> 26:26.187
What a sad type of idiot.

26:40.969 --> 26:42.070
Wow, this is...

26:42.103 --> 26:44.282
Well, yeah, I don't
think that's gonna yield much.

26:44.306 --> 26:47.075
No. Right, but...

26:47.108 --> 26:48.152
- Probably.
- You know...

26:48.176 --> 26:49.176
What's the matter?

26:51.079 --> 26:52.981
Do you think
they could be out there?

26:55.183 --> 26:56.518
Uh, I mean...

26:58.386 --> 26:59.387
Maybe.

27:06.261 --> 27:07.305
All right,
I think that's it.

27:07.329 --> 27:08.897
We are live streaming.

27:08.930 --> 27:09.799
And do I look at you,

27:09.831 --> 27:11.533
or should I look
right into the thing?

27:11.566 --> 27:13.301
Me.
Quick, uh, no, the camera.

27:13.335 --> 27:14.412
It's gonna take a picture.

27:14.436 --> 27:15.570
Okay, well...

27:18.340 --> 27:22.177
<i>Hi, everybody.
It's Marcel from before,</i>

27:22.210 --> 27:24.346
<i>and I'm recording this video</i>

27:24.379 --> 27:26.281
<i>because I'm looking
for my family.</i>

27:26.314 --> 27:28.216
<i>They were last seen
with this man.</i>

27:28.249 --> 27:29.184
<i>His name is Mark.</i>

27:29.217 --> 27:31.252
<i>They disappeared from the house</i>

27:31.286 --> 27:34.089
<i>owned by a woman named Larissa.</i>

27:34.122 --> 27:35.123
<i>Here it is.</i>

27:37.492 --> 27:39.461
<i>What we do
is manage properties</i>

27:39.494 --> 27:41.162
<i>that are on the short-term
rental market,</i>

27:41.196 --> 27:42.964
<i>so if somebody's
out of town for a long time</i>

27:42.997 --> 27:44.675
<i>and just wants to rent a place
for a while, we do that.</i>

27:44.699 --> 27:46.401
So would you
give me her number?

27:46.434 --> 27:47.545
<i>If there's a problem
with the property,</i>

27:47.569 --> 27:48.771
<i>I can send someone out,</i>

27:48.804 --> 27:49.815
<i>but I can't give you
any personal information.</i>

27:49.839 --> 27:53.174
Uh-huh. Hey, have you
ever eaten a raspberry?

27:54.476 --> 27:55.577
Hello?

27:58.313 --> 27:59.647
Darn it.

27:59.681 --> 28:02.283
<i>Just go for it.</i>

28:02.317 --> 28:04.452
<i>This is what they
look like. Uh, right here,</i>

28:04.486 --> 28:06.421
<i>and here and here.</i>

28:06.454 --> 28:08.323
<i>Um, I made this
just to give you a sense</i>

28:08.356 --> 28:10.158
<i>of who to be on the lookout for.</i>

28:14.562 --> 28:16.162
Sorry. I think I need
a little help here.

28:17.699 --> 28:20.568
Dean?
Hmm?

28:20.602 --> 28:22.113
Oh, Dean, come on.
Because of what you're doing.

28:22.137 --> 28:23.104
It's exciting.
It's a good scene.

28:23.138 --> 28:24.038
You could...
You could still film it.

28:24.072 --> 28:27.075
You can just put
the thingy on the thing.

28:27.108 --> 28:28.586
How would you do it
if I wasn't here?

28:28.610 --> 28:30.111
There's a lot of times

28:30.145 --> 28:32.414
where I just don't get stuff
that I need.

28:32.447 --> 28:34.191
You are here. That's actually
what the truth of it is.

28:34.215 --> 28:35.150
Yeah, but I don't
want to be in it.

28:35.183 --> 28:36.594
That's, like, defeats
the whole point of this.

28:38.453 --> 28:40.955
You know, Dean,
have you ever thought that...

28:43.091 --> 28:44.727
your life might be
a bit less lonely

28:44.760 --> 28:45.728
and a bit more integrated

28:45.761 --> 28:48.029
if you took the time
to connect with somebody

28:48.062 --> 28:49.664
and not just make videos
about them?

28:56.739 --> 28:57.939
Thank you.

28:59.040 --> 29:00.975
<i>And lastly,
this picture here</i>

29:01.009 --> 29:04.012
<i>shows the car
that Mark drove away in.</i>

29:04.045 --> 29:07.248
<i>It is a teal Mishibibi.</i>

29:07.282 --> 29:09.317
<i>- Mitsubishi.
- Mitsi-ibitsy.</i>

29:09.350 --> 29:10.618
<i>- And...
- Mitsubishi.</i>

29:10.652 --> 29:11.763
<i>What is it?
Mitsubishi.</i>

29:11.787 --> 29:14.155
<i>Mitsubatbitsubisy.</i>

29:14.189 --> 29:17.058
<i>Please leave any tips
or any helpful comments</i>

29:17.091 --> 29:18.393
<i>in the section below.</i>

29:18.426 --> 29:20.061
<i>Thank you. Have a great day.</i>

29:26.334 --> 29:29.537
<i>Update, guys,
I think we found it.</i>

29:32.073 --> 29:35.443
<i>It's Marcel's house.
It's Marcel Shell's house.</i>

29:35.477 --> 29:36.721
<i>Do you think you can
get in there right now?</i>

29:43.551 --> 29:44.562
<i>- Oh, someone' s coming.
- Go.</i>

29:44.586 --> 29:46.387
<i>We got to go.
Follow for more</i>

29:46.421 --> 29:48.356
<i>- celebrity homes.
- Just keep going.</i>

29:51.292 --> 29:52.427
Huh.

29:54.462 --> 29:55.497
Are they...

29:56.397 --> 29:58.199
Are they here to help?

29:59.434 --> 30:00.468
Mmm...

30:02.203 --> 30:03.203
Uh...

30:05.173 --> 30:08.711
Don't feel that
this is the task force

30:08.744 --> 30:10.345
I was hoping for.

30:15.450 --> 30:17.285
There's so much nothing.

30:19.153 --> 30:20.421
"She's the best."

30:20.455 --> 30:22.557
"She"? What?

30:22.590 --> 30:25.093
But my dad has pink shoes.
So did my grandfather.

30:27.462 --> 30:28.463
So cute.

30:29.765 --> 30:31.266
Ugh. Peace.

30:31.299 --> 30:33.668
Uh, yeah. Obviously peace.

30:33.701 --> 30:35.336
Like...

30:35.370 --> 30:37.205
What a weird thing
to try to test

30:37.238 --> 30:38.382
to see if someone else is into.

30:38.406 --> 30:40.308
Like, of course I'm into peace.

30:40.341 --> 30:42.510
No, sorry,
I'm a real war person.

30:43.511 --> 30:45.213
No, war actually.

30:45.246 --> 30:48.416
I sign all
my personal letters, "war."

30:48.449 --> 30:51.052
"Let the battle begin.
Marcel."

30:53.621 --> 30:54.622
Ugh!

30:56.825 --> 30:57.726
You know, there's...

30:57.760 --> 31:00.695
There is nothing in here
about finding them.

31:04.532 --> 31:06.668
It's still a group of people,

31:06.701 --> 31:08.737
but it's an audience.
It's not...

31:08.771 --> 31:10.605
It's not a community.
There's...

31:13.709 --> 31:14.710
Man.

31:17.679 --> 31:19.681
Oh! What about the car?

31:19.715 --> 31:21.282
What do you mean?

31:21.316 --> 31:23.852
Mark drove away in a teal car.

31:25.620 --> 31:28.590
So we can go look for it.
Like, if we find the car...

31:28.623 --> 31:29.768
Yeah,
I don't think that's like...

31:29.792 --> 31:30.859
That's not the way to...

31:30.893 --> 31:34.162
Wow! Okay, so it actually
doesn't even seem that big.

31:34.195 --> 31:36.130
I mean, it's big
but what we just need to do

31:36.164 --> 31:37.066
is get up high,

31:37.098 --> 31:38.867
and then maybe
we'll be able to spot his car.

31:38.901 --> 31:41.870
Mmm...
What's, like, your mantel?

31:41.904 --> 31:44.339
Like, when I need to
look out over the whole rug,

31:44.372 --> 31:46.307
I get up high.
I get up on the mantel.

31:47.710 --> 31:49.453
Do you see what I'm saying?
'Cause I can see...

31:49.477 --> 31:50.554
Yeah, no, I got it.
Yeah.

31:50.578 --> 31:52.222
Great, so we'll just head up
to the top of this thing,

31:52.246 --> 31:54.315
and then
we'll be able to see it.

31:54.349 --> 31:55.426
I don't think
we'll necessarily be able

31:55.450 --> 31:56.684
to see it.
I actually disagree.

32:01.489 --> 32:02.457
I don't think
it's a good idea because

32:02.490 --> 32:04.459
if we're... if we don't
have, like, a plan,

32:04.492 --> 32:05.360
then we're just,
sort of, flying blind.

32:05.393 --> 32:06.361
And we might just
waste a lot of time

32:06.394 --> 32:07.671
going around in circles.
Just put that there...

32:07.695 --> 32:10.498
What's that for?
It's just in case
we get in a fight.

32:10.531 --> 32:12.467
We're not
gonna get in any fights.

32:12.500 --> 32:14.302
You said it was dangerous
out there.

32:14.335 --> 32:16.213
It's dangerous
in a different way, so...
And you know what else?

32:16.237 --> 32:17.548
I should probably
bring this match.

32:17.572 --> 32:19.207
You don't need that.

32:19.240 --> 32:20.675
Uh, just give me
one more minute.

32:20.709 --> 32:22.276
I need some sort of a helmet.

32:22.310 --> 32:23.812
All right,
so you've got the book.

32:23.846 --> 32:25.279
You've got
a little bit of a raisin,

32:25.313 --> 32:26.423
which I really don't think
you're gonna finish,

32:26.447 --> 32:27.792
but you can go to town.
Go to town.

32:27.816 --> 32:28.860
Also, you have

32:28.884 --> 32:29.918
two drips of...

32:29.952 --> 32:31.185
Look over here.
What?

32:31.219 --> 32:32.353
You have two drips of water.

32:32.387 --> 32:34.857
You got an LED flashlight
in case the power goes out.

32:34.890 --> 32:36.925
You just got to step on it
like this. See?

32:36.959 --> 32:37.926
See how it... Whoa.
What?

32:37.960 --> 32:39.470
Sorry. But don't stand
right in front of it.

32:39.494 --> 32:41.596
Finally, this is the sparkler.

32:41.629 --> 32:43.398
What you do is you light
this end on fire,

32:43.431 --> 32:44.499
and then you step back.

32:44.532 --> 32:46.467
This can act
as a flare, all right?

32:46.501 --> 32:48.804
Why would I need it?
That's if you need
to signal for help.

32:48.837 --> 32:51.305
And Dean's gonna leave you
his phone just in case.

32:51.339 --> 32:52.349
What? No, I'm not.
Who will see the flare?

32:52.373 --> 32:54.375
You know what? Now that
I'm thinking about it,

32:54.409 --> 32:56.249
why don't we just
put the colander over you now

32:56.277 --> 32:57.311
if you want?

32:58.246 --> 32:59.915
All right, how's that?

33:00.749 --> 33:02.483
You must let me out of here.

33:02.517 --> 33:03.695
Do you want
Alan in there with...

33:19.333 --> 33:20.268
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay.

33:20.301 --> 33:22.470
I'm so sorry.
It's not a big deal. It's tiny.

33:25.573 --> 33:27.710
Whew.

33:28.443 --> 33:29.644
I think I'm okay.

33:32.680 --> 33:34.016
God, I am so sorry.

33:36.051 --> 33:38.352
Oh, my God.

33:38.386 --> 33:40.889
How many times a day
do you throw up in your car?

33:40.923 --> 33:41.957
There's a car. That...

33:41.990 --> 33:45.693
That's a teal, but, uh,
but that's more like, mmm...

33:45.728 --> 33:48.663
I've never seen a lake
except for in a picture.

33:48.696 --> 33:49.765
Let's do it.

33:52.500 --> 33:55.603
Uh, I think I'm gonna cry.

33:55.636 --> 33:56.739
It's very beautiful.

33:56.772 --> 33:58.841
There's fountains in the lake.

34:01.710 --> 34:05.714
And another car. And a car.
And a car. And a...

34:05.748 --> 34:08.349
There's a lot of places
to get tattoos.

34:08.382 --> 34:12.553
"Psychic love expert."
Wow, I bet... Wow.

34:12.587 --> 34:13.732
I could use
one of those.

34:13.756 --> 34:15.423
What would you want her to say?

34:15.456 --> 34:17.458
Uh, I don't know.

34:18.392 --> 34:19.795
There's more fish in the sea.

34:19.828 --> 34:21.529
Yeah.

34:21.562 --> 34:22.563
Yeah.

34:24.332 --> 34:26.376
Look, you got a lot of
smoocheroonies in your future.

34:26.400 --> 34:27.535
- I can see it now.
- Yeah.

34:27.568 --> 34:29.008
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, yeah.

34:29.037 --> 34:30.739
Ooh, baby, baby.

34:32.775 --> 34:33.909
Ooh, baby.

34:36.377 --> 34:38.679
I've seen people kiss
on television.

34:42.350 --> 34:43.752
I'm so sorry.

34:45.486 --> 34:46.554
Up here, yeah?

34:46.587 --> 34:48.023
Oh! Is it?
Oh, this is it!

34:48.056 --> 34:49.825
- This is it.
- Let's check it out.

34:51.827 --> 34:53.561
Whoa, we're really going up.

34:53.594 --> 34:55.563
Up, up, up.
This is gonna get high.

34:55.596 --> 34:56.732
Mmm-hmm.

34:56.765 --> 34:57.766
Wow.

35:01.536 --> 35:04.505
What are all the little dots
on the hills?

35:05.573 --> 35:06.909
Those are houses.

35:06.942 --> 35:08.342
All?

35:08.376 --> 35:09.845
Yeah. Those are houses
like yours.

35:11.713 --> 35:12.815
Really?

35:20.923 --> 35:22.323
What's all that?

35:23.992 --> 35:25.459
That's the rest of the city.

35:26.627 --> 35:29.630
Oh, right.
Right, right.

35:42.778 --> 35:43.812
I...

35:45.914 --> 35:47.415
I had no idea.

35:53.088 --> 35:56.859
Is this all there is
for out there?

35:57.692 --> 35:58.994
Mmm-mmm.

35:59.027 --> 36:03.598
This is like one part
of one big city.

36:04.465 --> 36:05.499
And the...
But, uh...

36:05.533 --> 36:07.135
But there are many big cities.

36:07.169 --> 36:10.839
There's lots of them.
I mean, you've seen,
like, you know,

36:10.873 --> 36:14.076
in movies and when it says,
like, "Tokyo" and...

36:14.109 --> 36:17.045
Uh-huh.
"Antarctica," those are
all different places.

36:19.014 --> 36:21.116
Oh. Right.

36:41.069 --> 36:43.437
There's so many places
that they could be.

36:45.908 --> 36:48.744
Do you think it's impossible?

36:48.777 --> 36:49.854
I don't think
it's impossible.

36:49.878 --> 36:51.445
I think that's just, uh...

36:54.649 --> 36:55.884
Look at that lady's dress.

36:55.918 --> 36:57.786
I know.
It's really nice.

37:04.692 --> 37:07.229
Thanks for the ride.
Yeah. It was fun.

37:07.262 --> 37:08.864
Oh. Look at this.

37:08.897 --> 37:10.866
They're right on the...
They're on the lawn.

37:11.967 --> 37:13.567
- They came right up.
- Stop it!

37:13.601 --> 37:14.679
You wouldn't get it.

37:14.703 --> 37:16.214
Hey, guys. Guys.

37:16.238 --> 37:17.906
I wanna be first.

37:17.940 --> 37:18.983
- Hey.
- Stop it!

37:19.007 --> 37:20.541
No, no.

37:20.574 --> 37:22.177
Um...

37:22.210 --> 37:23.587
Would you mind
just moving a little bit

37:23.611 --> 37:25.479
so we can pull the car in?

37:31.019 --> 37:32.087
Arthur.

37:32.120 --> 37:35.023
Nan! Nan!

37:37.558 --> 37:38.559
Nan!

37:41.662 --> 37:43.732
- Nan!
- Yes.

37:43.765 --> 37:45.934
Oh, my God.
Nan, are you...

37:45.968 --> 37:47.745
I'm just hurt
a little bit...
Oh, my God.

37:47.769 --> 37:49.204
- But I'm okay.
- You are?

37:49.237 --> 37:50.138
Please just...

37:50.172 --> 37:51.716
Just lean
your whole self on me.

37:51.740 --> 37:54.876
Put all your weight.
Don't worry, I can take it.

37:54.910 --> 37:56.577
And I guess... Okay.

37:56.610 --> 37:58.747
Uh,
let's just take it easy.

38:08.957 --> 38:12.728
<i>I'm really not sure
exactly of what happened</i>

38:12.761 --> 38:15.297
<i>because she won't tell me.</i>

38:15.330 --> 38:17.032
It could just be
that she doesn't remember,

38:17.065 --> 38:18.834
and I think
that's probably the case.

38:18.867 --> 38:20.202
Do you want me to stop?

38:20.235 --> 38:21.645
<i>But what I've been able
to piece together</i>

38:21.669 --> 38:25.941
<i>is that she did get startled,
then she fell off the dryer.</i>

38:25.974 --> 38:28.143
No! No! Arthur!

38:28.176 --> 38:29.677
Sorry.
Arthur, come here.

38:29.711 --> 38:30.746
- Arthur!
- Dean...

38:30.779 --> 38:32.047
Arthur! Come here.

38:32.914 --> 38:34.816
He... He... He has got to go.

38:34.850 --> 38:38.020
I cannot have him here
with Connie like this.

38:38.053 --> 38:40.588
It's not that
I don't like Arthur.

38:40.621 --> 38:42.724
Stop, Dean. I'm not kidding.

38:42.758 --> 38:43.825
Stop that.

38:44.760 --> 38:45.861
No! Oh, my God!

38:45.894 --> 38:48.096
- No! No. Off!
- Arthur! Arthur!

38:48.130 --> 38:49.765
All right.
A little bit more.

38:53.769 --> 38:54.770
Okay.

38:59.908 --> 39:01.609
<i>What's he, uh...</i>

39:02.377 --> 39:04.112
What's he being charged with?

39:05.013 --> 39:06.048
What?

39:06.081 --> 39:07.291
Is he going to the jail?

39:07.315 --> 39:08.850
No.

39:08.884 --> 39:10.952
Oh. Oh, phew.
'Cause I'm sorry. I thought...

39:10.986 --> 39:12.826
I'm going to take him
to my wife's house.

39:14.688 --> 39:16.058
Uh... You...

39:16.690 --> 39:18.093
What?

39:18.126 --> 39:19.303
Well,
we got separated recently,

39:19.327 --> 39:20.371
so that's why I'm staying here.

39:20.395 --> 39:21.830
I've been looking
for a new place.

39:22.696 --> 39:23.765
That's why I'm here.

39:23.799 --> 39:25.000
Why wouldn't you tell me this?

39:26.802 --> 39:28.379
Uh, I don't know.
I didn't think to.

39:28.403 --> 39:30.338
Okay.

39:30.372 --> 39:32.174
I told you so much. I...

39:32.207 --> 39:34.242
So...
I'm making a movie about you.

39:34.276 --> 39:36.344
I'm not making a movie about me.

39:36.378 --> 39:38.914
But you're also here.
And I was sharing.

39:38.947 --> 39:40.681
You didn't also think to share?

39:42.650 --> 39:44.128
And then you're just
pointing that around.
No.

39:44.152 --> 39:45.887
I do think about it.

39:45.921 --> 39:47.856
It's not...

39:47.889 --> 39:50.125
Why do you... Do you
always need to be filming?

39:50.158 --> 39:51.592
No.

39:55.864 --> 39:56.974
I think you'll be glad

39:56.998 --> 39:59.067
I have it, though. We have it.

39:59.101 --> 40:00.168
Uh-huh.

40:06.741 --> 40:09.244
Hold on.

40:09.277 --> 40:11.046
Can we pause
the videos that we made

40:11.079 --> 40:12.613
so people can't see them,
please?

40:15.317 --> 40:16.818
Yeah,
I can take 'em down.

40:20.055 --> 40:22.033
I just can't have more
people coming to the house

40:22.057 --> 40:23.758
like... Like how
it happened today.

40:25.060 --> 40:27.095
I can't believe
I let this happen.

40:42.844 --> 40:44.880
<i>Well, you know,
she sleeps a lot.</i>

40:48.283 --> 40:50.218
<i>And she hasn't been eating
very much.</i>

40:52.854 --> 40:54.890
<i>It's looking good.
You just gotta keep on moving.</i>

40:54.923 --> 40:56.033
<i>You're just one more little...</i>

40:56.057 --> 40:57.392
Let me do...
I can do it.

40:57.425 --> 41:00.762
<i>She's just not able to do</i>

41:00.795 --> 41:05.066
<i>a lot of the things that
she used to be able to do.</i>

41:05.100 --> 41:06.177
- Yeah, that's...
- Hurts.

41:06.201 --> 41:08.179
Over again.
Sorry, did you
shut the window?

41:08.203 --> 41:10.172
Yes,
I shut the window.

41:10.205 --> 41:11.907
Don't help me here.
I don't need help.

41:11.940 --> 41:14.176
Nana,
I'm not even doing anything.

41:23.451 --> 41:25.353
Uh!

41:25.387 --> 41:26.454
<i>The skater rink,</i>

41:26.488 --> 41:29.291
<i>you know, is usually
just for the holidays.</i>

41:31.193 --> 41:33.094
- Want to try...
- How am I looking?

41:33.128 --> 41:35.964
You need, uh,
maybe once or twice more.

41:35.997 --> 41:37.032
Okay.

41:37.065 --> 41:38.900
<i>But I set it up just to...</i>

41:40.969 --> 41:42.771
<i>try to cheer her up a bit.</i>

41:44.873 --> 41:46.975
Pump it. Pump it up.
Come on, Nan.

41:47.442 --> 41:48.443
Up.

41:49.010 --> 41:50.045
All right!

41:50.078 --> 41:51.279
Nana, pump it up.

41:51.313 --> 41:53.315
No, no.
No, no, I don't think so.

41:53.348 --> 41:55.784
Don't you wanna pump it up?
No, no.

41:55.817 --> 41:59.020
When I say "jam,"
you say "Nan." Jam.

42:00.455 --> 42:02.366
<i>Well, she won't skate with me
anymore, that's for sure.</i>

42:02.390 --> 42:03.992
<i>Get into it, a little bit.</i>

42:04.025 --> 42:06.494
Stop it.

42:07.929 --> 42:08.997
<i>But you know what?</i>

42:09.030 --> 42:11.266
<i>She... She really
does like the dust.</i>

42:12.901 --> 42:15.003
<i>For her, it's special.
She's not from here.</i>

42:15.036 --> 42:18.306
<i>She's from the garage.
That's why she has the accent.</i>

42:18.340 --> 42:20.875
It's this wonderful smell.

42:20.909 --> 42:22.544
<i>She traveled here
by coat pocket</i>

42:22.577 --> 42:24.546
<i>when she was really little.</i>

42:24.579 --> 42:26.781
I just feel...

42:26.815 --> 42:30.051
<i>And so I think
it reminds her of home.</i>

42:30.986 --> 42:33.521
Nan, look at this. Ready?

42:43.965 --> 42:45.900
Oh!

42:47.135 --> 42:48.436
Grandma Connie, we need to move!

42:48.470 --> 42:49.804
Not that way. This way!

42:49.838 --> 42:51.539
Get it out!
I'll get the rover!

42:54.542 --> 42:55.977
Did I hit it?

42:56.011 --> 42:57.288
Not coming over here?
Come follow my voice.

42:57.312 --> 42:59.848
- Your left or my left.
- Your left.

42:59.881 --> 43:00.849
<i>At this point,
the good days</i>

43:00.882 --> 43:03.985
<i>are harder to come by with her.</i>

43:04.019 --> 43:06.087
I mean, he's right here.
He's on the couch.

43:06.121 --> 43:07.555
Yeah, I'm looking right at him.

43:07.589 --> 43:11.126
<i>And then the bad days
are just actually astounding.</i>

43:11.159 --> 43:12.527
Oh! He can jump.

43:13.928 --> 43:14.863
There he... There he goes!

43:14.896 --> 43:17.232
- Ah, all right, all right.
- Yay!

43:17.265 --> 43:19.968
<i>I'm trying not to
treat her any differently,</i>

43:20.001 --> 43:22.537
<i>but it's, uh, keeping me on
my toes, I'll tell you that.</i>

43:22.570 --> 43:23.972
Wait,
I'm gonna close this.

43:31.212 --> 43:32.614
Wow, look at this.

43:36.051 --> 43:37.491
- You might be interested.
- Right?

43:38.253 --> 43:39.354
Oh, my gosh.

43:40.488 --> 43:41.489
I know.

43:42.991 --> 43:44.125
With Lesley Stahl.

43:45.360 --> 43:46.361
Oh, my gosh.

43:48.463 --> 43:50.598
Ugh. This is a...

43:51.599 --> 43:53.101
This is...

43:54.402 --> 43:56.371
Oh, my God.

43:56.404 --> 43:58.524
- It's amazing, isn't it?
- Mmm, yeah, yeah.

44:00.108 --> 44:01.109
It's really...

44:05.980 --> 44:07.882
We can't show this
to Nana Connie.

44:09.417 --> 44:10.618
Absolutely not.

44:10.652 --> 44:11.662
I mean,
I could ask them to keep

44:11.686 --> 44:13.164
the crew really small,
then they wouldn't make

44:13.188 --> 44:15.557
a big footprint.
No. No, no, no.

44:17.025 --> 44:19.294
Can I ask them
how many people would come in?

44:19.327 --> 44:20.662
No.
What?

44:20.695 --> 44:23.164
I'm not taking the risk.

44:23.198 --> 44:24.508
- There are a lot...
- What is the risk?

44:24.532 --> 44:27.068
The risk? Look what
already happened to Nana Connie.

44:29.104 --> 44:31.606
"We're wondering
if you might be interested

44:31.639 --> 44:34.476
"to discuss doing an interview
piece with Lesley Stahl."

44:34.509 --> 44:36.511
We can't do it, Nan.

44:36.544 --> 44:37.713
The real Lesley?

44:37.747 --> 44:39.323
Yeah,
it's the real Lesley.
Don't do that.

44:39.347 --> 44:41.683
"Please let me know
if you're interested.

44:41.717 --> 44:43.561
"We'd love to make it work."

44:43.585 --> 44:45.954
This recovery
is not happening fast enough,

44:45.987 --> 44:48.923
and now she has attitude,
and I feel bad.

44:48.957 --> 44:50.658
We'll just do it
once she's feeling better

44:50.692 --> 44:51.761
and moving around better.

44:51.794 --> 44:54.229
How many of those
do you take? Don't take a lot.

44:54.262 --> 44:56.498
I'm not taking,
'cause I don't know how...

44:56.531 --> 44:57.709
when I'm gonna get another one.

44:57.733 --> 44:59.701
This is how I live.

44:59.735 --> 45:04.372
We just had to work so hard
just to do this,

45:05.340 --> 45:06.718
just to find
new ways of doing things

45:06.742 --> 45:08.376
and learning
how to survive on our own.

45:08.410 --> 45:09.544
And I guess it's...

45:11.546 --> 45:16.251
I don't wanna end up
with less... than what I have.

45:16.284 --> 45:17.729
I can't make
this decision for you, but...

45:17.753 --> 45:19.096
No, you're not. I've already
made it for myself.

45:19.120 --> 45:21.720
This is a really
good way to find them.
I said no.

45:51.619 --> 45:54.389
He's no fun to be around, is he?

45:57.559 --> 46:01.029
Do... Do you have
any corner pieces over there?

46:01.062 --> 46:02.530
I want you to do it.

46:02.564 --> 46:06.167
No. Nan, no. And we already...
We told them no.

46:07.402 --> 46:10.672
But don't you want
to meet Lesley Stahl?

46:10.706 --> 46:13.208
We need quiet, Nana.

46:13.241 --> 46:15.744
We don't need a lot of people
coming in here and...

46:15.778 --> 46:17.679
You don't...
You don't need quiet for me.

46:17.713 --> 46:19.647
I don't want quiet.
Oh.

46:24.285 --> 46:26.354
Nope.
I think you should do it.

46:27.455 --> 46:29.366
You know, we're just
flying blind. I don't...

46:29.390 --> 46:31.590
I don't even know what we're
supposed to be making here.

46:32.260 --> 46:33.695
What is this even a picture of?

46:36.264 --> 46:37.398
Do you have any blue pieces?

46:37.432 --> 46:40.034
<i>He seems...
He's bound up, isn't he?</i>

46:41.603 --> 46:43.137
Mmm.

46:44.272 --> 46:45.673
I think he's afraid of

46:46.574 --> 46:48.142
change.

46:48.811 --> 46:50.011
Scary.

46:51.579 --> 46:54.215
Especially after
what we went through.

46:57.720 --> 47:00.488
But life's not
gonna go on unless...

47:01.857 --> 47:03.424
if you don't.

47:03.458 --> 47:05.593
If you don't open up, right?

47:07.529 --> 47:09.197
Do you know that, Dean?

47:10.833 --> 47:12.133
Heh, heh, heh.

47:13.802 --> 47:15.346
<i>Who among us hasn't wished...</i>

47:16.437 --> 47:18.373
<i>we could read
someone else's mind?</i>

47:18.406 --> 47:20.608
<i>Know exactly
what they're thinking.</i>

47:20.642 --> 47:22.811
<i>Well, that's impossible,
of course...</i>

47:22.845 --> 47:24.078
<i>I want him to...</i>

47:25.113 --> 47:27.515
<i>I want him to dive in life,
you know?</i>

47:27.549 --> 47:29.450
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

47:29.484 --> 47:33.087
<i>I'm not gonna
be here forever. Hmm.</i>

47:34.823 --> 47:36.324
You know what I mean?

47:37.793 --> 47:39.503
Uh, yeah, I think
he's just worried that...

47:39.527 --> 47:40.562
Maybe he'll feel...

47:40.595 --> 47:42.635
He'll sort of lighten up
when you're feeling better.

47:43.431 --> 47:45.266
Better?
Yeah.

47:46.401 --> 47:47.502
Feeling better.

47:49.237 --> 47:52.407
Better. Better. Better. Hmm.

47:52.440 --> 47:55.209
T-t-t-t-t-tch. Better.

48:00.381 --> 48:01.382
Connie?

48:02.317 --> 48:03.418
Nan?

48:05.286 --> 48:07.155
Huh.

48:07.188 --> 48:10.258
It's weird because I did think
I heard her up. Listen...

48:12.160 --> 48:13.528
What the...

48:15.931 --> 48:17.900
Nan.

48:17.933 --> 48:19.410
Are you...
Look how fun this is. Look.

48:19.434 --> 48:21.312
You're just out here?
Look,
I had forgotten how fun...

48:21.336 --> 48:22.479
Yeah, how long
have you been out here?

48:22.503 --> 48:24.505
Look, I can...

48:24.539 --> 48:26.775
Oh! What is going on right...

48:26.809 --> 48:27.843
Nan, you're really...

48:27.876 --> 48:29.688
I have to work on my aim,
but look, look, look.

48:29.712 --> 48:30.645
Yeah, I see that.

48:30.678 --> 48:32.881
I've been trying
to get it.

48:34.549 --> 48:36.885
<i>♪ What so proudly</i>

48:36.919 --> 48:38.152
<i>♪ We hailed...</i>

48:39.287 --> 48:40.388
<i>♪ At the twilight's... ♪</i>

48:40.421 --> 48:41.632
I never understood the words,
but I could do it with...

48:41.656 --> 48:42.834
<i>Yeah.</i>

48:42.858 --> 48:45.094
<i>I don't wanna
get ahead of myself,</i>

48:45.126 --> 48:49.697
<i>but she seems to suddenly
have a lot more energy.</i>

48:49.732 --> 48:51.199
Do you know
what that is?

48:51.232 --> 48:52.200
- It's the...
- They play that

48:52.233 --> 48:52.935
- before the sports.
- Yeah, before sports.

48:52.968 --> 48:54.669
It means
the sports are starting.

48:54.702 --> 48:55.880
What kind of sports
do you watch?

48:55.904 --> 48:58.874
They like running after balls
or squash them.

48:58.907 --> 48:59.908
Kicking.

48:59.942 --> 49:02.811
Put them over, like, a net
sometimes, they do that.

49:02.845 --> 49:04.823
But the net is a hole, so
it comes right out.

49:04.847 --> 49:06.858
Right, so it's just like,
why do you put it back in?

49:06.882 --> 49:08.359
<i>- It's really strange.
- I do notice,</i>

49:08.383 --> 49:11.720
<i>I think, that she's definitely
been eating better.</i>

49:11.754 --> 49:13.756
Mmm. My favorite.

49:13.789 --> 49:15.356
Nope, not for you.

49:17.558 --> 49:20.261
Bup. Nan, you really...

49:20.294 --> 49:21.764
Did you just eat
that whole thing?

49:21.797 --> 49:24.399
Oh, yes, of course.
I love shish kebab.

49:24.432 --> 49:26.200
- Wow.
- No, we're still friends.

49:26.234 --> 49:28.403
Why did you
divorce her? Was your wife...

49:28.436 --> 49:29.916
She's great.
We just grew apart.

49:32.841 --> 49:34.052
You okay?
I'm totally fine.

49:34.076 --> 49:35.120
Are you sure?
Maybe you should
be resting or...

49:35.144 --> 49:38.279
Nan, maybe we'll think of...
Who decided to leave?

49:38.312 --> 49:40.716
- You or her?
- It was pretty mutual.

49:40.749 --> 49:43.952
You don't fool me.
It's never mutual.

49:46.021 --> 49:48.356
And she's... she's got
some of her color back.

49:48.389 --> 49:49.768
You're broken.
You're making

49:49.792 --> 49:51.435
- this documentary to...
- Oh, my...

49:51.459 --> 49:52.636
So you don't
have to think of her?

49:52.660 --> 49:54.797
Is that why?
'Cause he's heartbroken.

49:54.830 --> 49:56.664
Are you heartbroken, Dean?

49:56.698 --> 49:59.600
He's laughing, so maybe
he's not so heartbroken.

49:59.634 --> 50:00.812
Look at her.
She's just completely

50:00.836 --> 50:02.670
bounced back. It's like...
Completely.

50:02.705 --> 50:05.239
- 100%.
- Wow.

50:05.273 --> 50:07.508
I hope I get that...
those genes.

50:11.880 --> 50:13.657
Because...
I mean,
that's not part of the deal.

50:13.681 --> 50:15.616
Do you want me
to be happy?

50:15.650 --> 50:17.485
- Yeah.
- Do the interview.

50:18.553 --> 50:20.823
She got you there.

50:20.856 --> 50:22.891
All right. For you.

50:22.925 --> 50:23.992
I like you brave.

50:24.026 --> 50:26.360
Come on.

50:26.394 --> 50:27.863
Two...

50:27.896 --> 50:30.431
Uh, six...
Over to the left, yeah.

50:32.500 --> 50:34.335
Eight.

50:35.804 --> 50:37.706
And now just the green button.

50:41.744 --> 50:43.712
Boom, baby.

50:45.948 --> 50:47.281
You got this.

50:48.416 --> 50:49.450
<i>CBS.</i>

50:49.484 --> 50:51.754
Oh, uh... hello?

50:52.755 --> 50:53.898
<i>Put it on speaker.
Hello?</i>

50:53.922 --> 50:55.256
Hello, is this...

50:55.891 --> 50:57.692
<i>Hello?
Is this Shari?</i>

50:57.726 --> 51:00.996
<i>Yes, it is! Is this...
Hi, Shari, uh, this is Marcel.</i>

51:01.029 --> 51:02.530
This is Dean.
I'm also on the line.

51:02.563 --> 51:04.532
<i>Hi, nice to speak with you guys.</i>

51:04.565 --> 51:06.601
<i>Nice to speak with you.
Um...</i>

51:06.634 --> 51:08.402
<i>Sorry. Go ahead.
Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

51:08.436 --> 51:09.437
I just said it was...

51:09.470 --> 51:11.940
That it's also nice
to speak with you as well.

51:11.974 --> 51:13.414
<i>It's nice
to talk to you, too.</i>

51:13.441 --> 51:16.011
He was acting calm
and collected,

51:16.044 --> 51:18.714
and I knew he was, like,

51:18.747 --> 51:22.017
the front, Mr. Serious Face,
Mr. Cucumber,

51:22.050 --> 51:24.385
but inside, butterflies.

51:24.418 --> 51:25.453
<i>Absolutely, yes.</i>

51:25.486 --> 51:27.956
<i>Talk about your family
and your search to find them.</i>

51:27.990 --> 51:29.901
<i>Sometimes we'll learn
something as we're shooting,</i>

51:29.925 --> 51:31.894
<i>and that can lead
to new discoveries.</i>

51:31.927 --> 51:33.694
Mmm-hmm.
And, uh, do you think it's...

51:33.729 --> 51:36.098
It's a possibility
that something could,

51:36.131 --> 51:37.833
uh, come from...

51:37.866 --> 51:40.035
<i>Yeah, I mean,
there's no promises,</i>

51:40.068 --> 51:42.503
<i>but if you have information,
we'll see where...</i>

51:42.537 --> 51:44.106
<i>Where our reporting leads.</i>

51:44.139 --> 51:47.508
<i>Um, and, Dean, one other thing
I wanted to ask you is,</i>

51:47.542 --> 51:49.812
<i>you know, I think
it might be really interesting</i>

51:49.845 --> 51:51.914
<i>to interview you
as part of the story as well.</i>

51:51.947 --> 51:53.787
<i>Is that something
that you're comfortable with?</i>

51:54.682 --> 51:55.918
Uh, I don't know.

51:55.951 --> 51:57.652
I mean, I'm generally
behind the camera.

51:57.685 --> 51:59.788
Ah! Ah!

51:59.822 --> 52:02.825
Somebody doesn't
wanna do it. Oh!

52:02.858 --> 52:05.593
Uh, I'll get back to you
on it. How about that?

52:28.416 --> 52:30.384
Hmm?

52:30.418 --> 52:32.054
This is a little doorbell.

52:34.488 --> 52:36.091
Good morning, Nan.

52:39.962 --> 52:40.963
Nan?

52:42.463 --> 52:43.564
Huh.

52:49.838 --> 52:51.405
Just one second.

52:54.675 --> 52:56.577
Good morning, Nan.

52:56.611 --> 52:58.579
- Today's the day.
- Yes.

53:00.548 --> 53:01.682
Oh, Nan.

53:01.717 --> 53:03.719
Oh, no, I'm fine.
I was just going to...

53:03.752 --> 53:07.122
Are you sure that's...
Does it hurt still or...
No, adjusted.

53:07.155 --> 53:09.423
Getting better already.
Look, look.

53:10.092 --> 53:11.559
All right.

53:14.863 --> 53:16.040
I'm gonna grab you some water.

53:16.064 --> 53:17.565
Oh, thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

53:26.241 --> 53:27.642
Got your water here.

53:27.675 --> 53:29.878
Ice-cold,
thirst-quenching water.

53:29.912 --> 53:33.949
Who wants it? A water, water,
who wants a water?

53:33.982 --> 53:35.217
Thank you, Marcello.

53:35.250 --> 53:37.119
You're welcome.

53:37.152 --> 53:39.922
Quite a day for Lesley Stahl.

53:43.158 --> 53:46.061
There's
definitely a storm rolling in.

53:47.495 --> 53:48.663
I can feel it.

53:49.831 --> 53:52.234
I can feel it because
my shell feels tight.

53:59.573 --> 54:01.609
Do I seem nervous?

54:01.642 --> 54:02.687
- It's okay to be nervous.
- Ugh.

54:03.912 --> 54:05.013
Let me get that.

54:05.047 --> 54:06.447
Yeah, I guess.

54:10.719 --> 54:11.920
Uh...

54:11.954 --> 54:14.588
I...

54:14.622 --> 54:15.733
- Is that...
- What? What is it?

54:15.757 --> 54:18.693
That's the shish kebab
from the other night.

54:18.727 --> 54:20.138
Where is she?
Do you know where she is?

54:20.162 --> 54:21.229
Nana.

54:21.263 --> 54:22.164
<i>You took away my vote.
You didn't ask me.</i>

54:22.197 --> 54:23.065
<i>I can't believe you lied.</i>

54:23.098 --> 54:23.966
- You lied to me, Nan.
- You took my...

54:23.999 --> 54:26.168
You wrote me off.
I did not write you off.

54:26.201 --> 54:27.577
Did youask me?
No, you didn't.

54:27.601 --> 54:28.636
So?
You just said no

54:28.669 --> 54:29.805
<i>to 60 Minutes, end of story.</i>

54:29.838 --> 54:32.174
I made a decision for your
health 'cause I was worried

54:32.207 --> 54:33.141
about you.

54:33.175 --> 54:36.178
Should I get the door?

54:36.211 --> 54:37.621
That's what I want.

54:37.645 --> 54:38.579
Well, I...
I want that too,

54:38.612 --> 54:40.716
- but this is...
- All I want...

54:40.749 --> 54:42.050
- Nan.
- All I want

54:42.084 --> 54:43.952
is for you to try.

54:43.986 --> 54:45.087
- I want you...
- No...

54:45.120 --> 54:46.154
Nan...

54:46.188 --> 54:47.055
It's a big wide world.

54:47.089 --> 54:48.099
I don't wanna
lose everything

54:48.123 --> 54:50.691
in the hope of something.
That's already gone.

54:50.726 --> 54:52.003
You break my heart
if you don't.

54:52.027 --> 54:53.627
Hello?

54:53.661 --> 54:54.706
You can tell 'em
we need to cancel

54:54.730 --> 54:55.797
if you want to do that.

54:55.831 --> 54:56.908
Well,
what's the option?

54:56.932 --> 54:58.233
- Dean?
- Mmm-hmm?

54:58.266 --> 55:00.002
Please,
can you shut up?

55:03.238 --> 55:05.639
Marcello...
Yes?

55:05.673 --> 55:07.776
Let's forget about being afraid.

55:09.244 --> 55:12.247
Uh...
Is Lesley afraid?

55:13.315 --> 55:16.752
Mmm, no, Lesley is fearless.

55:16.785 --> 55:18.854
It may be good, it may be not,

55:18.887 --> 55:21.990
but just take the adventure.

55:22.024 --> 55:27.229
Don't use me as an excuse
not to live. Hmm?

55:34.803 --> 55:35.904
But what if...

55:36.872 --> 55:38.672
What if everything changes...

55:39.941 --> 55:41.076
again?

55:42.978 --> 55:45.714
Marcello, oh...

55:45.747 --> 55:46.782
Yeah.

55:49.351 --> 55:50.719
It will.

55:54.923 --> 55:55.924
Aw.

55:56.958 --> 55:58.026
Come here.

56:07.035 --> 56:09.071
Okay, well...
let's do it.

56:10.338 --> 56:12.007
Come on, go, go.

56:13.141 --> 56:14.142
Yeah.

56:19.647 --> 56:21.783
Hello. Come in!

56:21.817 --> 56:23.051
Hi, it's so nice to meet you.

56:23.085 --> 56:24.262
It's good
to finally meet you.

56:24.286 --> 56:25.797
You're Shari, I presume?
You have a camera.

56:25.821 --> 56:27.231
Oh, I do have a camera.
Okay, then.

56:27.255 --> 56:28.766
Is that okay?
Can I film while you guys

56:28.790 --> 56:29.967
- are setting up?
- Sure, sure.

56:29.991 --> 56:30.892
- Yeah? That's great.
- Whoa.

56:30.926 --> 56:34.329
Those gentlemen were not
wearing bee-odorant.

56:42.170 --> 56:43.972
- Whoa, whoa! Whoa!
- Whoa!

56:44.005 --> 56:45.373
- Did you see that?
- I did.

56:45.407 --> 56:47.008
Just those boxes walking.

56:47.042 --> 56:48.810
And then behind them,
there were men.

56:48.844 --> 56:50.779
Look at ponytail over here

56:50.812 --> 56:52.056
looking around for the bathroom.

56:52.080 --> 56:53.849
Trying to act like
it's not an emergency.

56:55.784 --> 56:58.920
It's over there!

56:58.954 --> 56:59.964
What are you...
What are you doing to him?

56:59.988 --> 57:01.899
Now,
I'm just sort of giving Marcel

57:01.923 --> 57:04.126
a little bit of bronzer
just to kind of warm up.

57:04.159 --> 57:05.203
That tickles.

57:05.227 --> 57:07.395
I'm just gonna
do a little bit here.

57:07.429 --> 57:08.763
Oh.

57:08.797 --> 57:10.942
Sorry, I spit on you.
Close... That's okay.
Close your mouth.

57:10.966 --> 57:12.276
Hey, now look,
now he's on TV.

57:12.300 --> 57:13.969
Okay, but now
he's back in real life.

57:14.002 --> 57:16.438
This guy over here, look.
Real life, on TV.

57:16.471 --> 57:17.706
Oh, look at that one.

57:17.739 --> 57:18.907
That's Toolbelt.

57:18.940 --> 57:20.275
And that one?

57:20.308 --> 57:21.419
That's just
Mr. Headphones.

57:22.577 --> 57:23.311
Do you wanna
see what you look like?

57:23.345 --> 57:25.679
Oh, my God.
Don't you look rested?

57:25.714 --> 57:27.458
Yeah, I look like I, like,
only drink olive oil.

57:28.783 --> 57:29.994
This guy over here, look.

57:30.018 --> 57:31.953
Real life, on TV.
Marcello, look.

57:31.987 --> 57:33.030
Good.
How was your flight?

57:33.054 --> 57:34.094
It was okay.

57:34.122 --> 57:35.891
Yeah?
You know, long.

57:35.924 --> 57:37.726
All right,
well, we have a fun day...

57:37.759 --> 57:39.828
Nana, make the noise.

57:47.869 --> 57:49.780
Marcel, can I get you
to stand in real quick?

57:49.804 --> 57:52.340
Oh, yes. Uh, Nan,
uh, are you gonna be...

57:52.374 --> 57:54.709
Go, go.
Yes, of course. Go.
Okay.

57:54.743 --> 57:55.676
Go.
Coming through.

57:55.710 --> 57:56.511
I'll bring him right back.

57:56.545 --> 57:58.146
- Yeah.
- Be right back.

57:58.180 --> 57:59.281
Goodbye.

58:01.416 --> 58:02.683
On real life,

58:07.889 --> 58:08.890
on TV.

58:10.325 --> 58:12.294
Wow, I think, uh... Yeah.

58:12.327 --> 58:14.763
I think that's the brightest
thing I've ever seen.

58:45.894 --> 58:47.329
I...
I know that you like

58:47.362 --> 58:49.931
these kind of things
for your movie.

58:49.965 --> 58:52.200
- It might... might be good.
- Mmm.

58:54.069 --> 58:56.104
I found this the other day.

58:56.137 --> 58:58.907
Mmm... Here it is.

58:58.940 --> 59:01.876
It's about season changing.

59:01.910 --> 59:04.512
This book... This book
I had for many, many years.

59:05.380 --> 59:08.283
But I had not noticed

59:08.316 --> 59:11.786
this... This part that
I would like to read you.

59:11.820 --> 59:13.321
Please.

59:22.564 --> 59:24.008
All right, guys,
five to four minutes.

59:24.032 --> 59:25.233
Four minutes, everybody.

Let's reset.
Let's go to one, please.

59:40.949 --> 59:43.885
<i>"Is it that

59:43.918 --> 59:47.856

- Yep.

We're done.

1:00:58.426 --> 1:01:00.995
All right, everybody.
That's a wrap on Marcel!

1:01:16.544 --> 1:01:17.922
I think they had
to get to the outlet,

1:01:17.946 --> 1:01:19.090
but we can get them
to move it back.

1:01:19.114 --> 1:01:20.081
Yeah, but if something
moved and nobody noticed

1:01:20.115 --> 1:01:22.050
Nana Connie, she could be
behind something.

1:01:22.617 --> 1:01:23.885
Nan?

1:01:25.019 --> 1:01:26.630
I just... Sometimes she goes
to the toilet

1:01:26.654 --> 1:01:27.989
and sits on the rim.

1:01:28.456 --> 1:01:29.491
Nan?

1:01:31.426 --> 1:01:34.162
- You checked her room, yeah?
- No.

1:01:34.195 --> 1:01:35.439
<i>Yeah, do you want... I mean,
should we go over...</i>

1:01:35.463 --> 1:01:36.965

I'm glad
I got to meet her.

1:02:06.060 --> 1:02:07.228
Me, too.

1:02:15.603 --> 1:02:17.505
She probably felt tired.

1:02:19.374 --> 1:02:22.277
Especially after
being very excited.

1:02:26.448 --> 1:02:28.383
Have you ever done that before,

1:02:28.416 --> 1:02:31.386
like, when there's a party
in your house?

1:02:33.455 --> 1:02:35.523
Sometimes it's easiest to rest

1:02:36.524 --> 1:02:38.092
when you go off by yourself

1:02:38.126 --> 1:02:41.129
and you can still hear
the noise of the party,

1:02:41.162 --> 1:02:44.432
and you feel safe knowing that
so many people are around...

1:02:44.466 --> 1:02:46.267
Yeah.
That you can have a rest?

1:02:46.301 --> 1:02:47.736
Mmm-hmm.

1:02:54.542 --> 1:02:56.611
That's good. And now this one.

1:03:08.757 --> 1:03:12.360
<i>She was exactly what you would
want a grandmother to be.</i>

1:03:15.764 --> 1:03:18.299
and a colorful personality,

1:03:18.333 --> 1:03:21.804
and she didn't get sanded down
by life.

1:03:44.793 --> 1:03:46.060
Hello!

1:03:47.595 --> 1:03:49.264
- Hi.
- Hi.

1:03:50.498 --> 1:03:51.767
Why're you in the tree?

1:03:53.701 --> 1:03:55.838
- Sorry?
- That's my tree.

1:03:55.871 --> 1:03:57.539
- This is yours?
- Yeah.

1:03:57.572 --> 1:03:59.572
Oh, I'm sorry. It looked
like it was on hers.

1:03:59.607 --> 1:04:00.675
Nope.

1:04:04.279 --> 1:04:05.790
Well, do you mind if
I stay up here for a minute?

1:04:05.814 --> 1:04:07.716
- I'm just... It's a short...
- I do mind.

1:04:07.750 --> 1:04:08.784
I don't have insurance

1:04:08.817 --> 1:04:10.385

up there.

1:04:12.120 --> 1:04:14.422
Okay, coming down.
Sorry.

1:04:15.156 --> 1:04:16.224
- Okay.
- You fall,

1:04:16.257 --> 1:04:18.693
something happens, I'm liable.

1:04:18.727 --> 1:04:20.228

that you're actually...

1:04:20.261 --> 1:04:22.363
Is it... Not with a studio

1:04:22.397 --> 1:04:23.565

- No.

1:04:32.574 --> 1:04:34.475
Whoa, all right.

1:04:34.509 --> 1:04:38.446
Okay, and I made her
look like an everything bagel.

Perfect.

Nope.

1:09:03.745 --> 1:09:07.015
Marcel the Shell
shares his unique perspective

1:09:07.049 --> 1:09:09.550
on what we take for granted.

1:09:09.584 --> 1:09:12.721
He adds new meanings
to the simplest of ideas.

1:09:13.554 --> 1:09:16.557
Marcel, a 1 inch-tall shell,

1:09:16.591 --> 1:09:19.795
reminds us of
the true value of community,

1:09:19.828 --> 1:09:22.630
the transformative power
of friendship,

1:09:22.663 --> 1:09:27.102
and the most ingenious use
for a tennis ball.

1:09:27.135 --> 1:09:28.904
<i>But if you
wanna make sure</i>

1:09:28.937 --> 1:09:32.406
<i>that your parking space is,
like, perfectly flat,</i>

1:09:32.440 --> 1:09:35.911
because otherwise, it's not
gonna be where you left it.

1:09:35.944 --> 1:09:37.255
And... And I don't have
the model...

1:09:37.279 --> 1:09:39.547
<i>For years, Marcel
and his grandmother Connie</i>

1:09:39.580 --> 1:09:42.885
<i>shared this old house
with their pet lint, Alan,</i>

1:09:42.918 --> 1:09:45.620
<i>and an ever-changing array
of human guests.</i>

1:09:45.653 --> 1:09:47.488
I just stay
out of their way and...

1:09:47.521 --> 1:09:49.557
And stay out of sight,
and it worked.

1:09:49.590 --> 1:09:50.893
<i>But all that changed</i>

1:09:50.926 --> 1:09:53.427
<i>when an amateur filmmaker
moved in.</i>

1:09:53.461 --> 1:09:54.973
So kind of on all the time.
And so, I felt like

1:09:54.997 --> 1:09:56.865
I could just roll
and roll and roll.

1:09:56.899 --> 1:09:59.533
Um, Dean, what were
your first impressions?

1:09:59.567 --> 1:10:02.771
Uh, I guess
I was impressed with his, um,

1:10:03.571 --> 1:10:04.639
pizzazz...

1:10:04.672 --> 1:10:06.474
- his spark, you know?
- Wow.

1:10:06.507 --> 1:10:07.976
Uh, pfft.

1:10:08.010 --> 1:10:09.677
No, I... I like it.

1:10:09.711 --> 1:10:11.013
And maybe you needed...

1:10:11.046 --> 1:10:13.181
Needed the connection,
needed the friendship.

1:10:13.215 --> 1:10:14.983
Yeah, maybe you needed
the friendship.

1:10:16.785 --> 1:10:20.088
Marcel, how long has it been
since you've seen your family?

1:10:21.156 --> 1:10:23.557
Well, I don't do the clock

1:10:23.591 --> 1:10:25.693
the way that you guys
do the clock.

1:10:25.727 --> 1:10:28.230
Right.
Uh, but I think

1:10:28.263 --> 1:10:31.033
I'm watching the changes
in the trees and

1:10:32.167 --> 1:10:33.701
the flowers that have bloomed

1:10:33.735 --> 1:10:36.671
and the blossoms
that have fallen.

1:10:36.705 --> 1:10:39.708
The buds that have come
and bloomed again.

1:10:39.741 --> 1:10:42.744
So I... I couldn't tell you,
but I, uh...

1:10:42.778 --> 1:10:46.547
The space in my heart gets
bigger and louder every day.

1:10:46.580 --> 1:10:48.649
Mmm. Dean,
do you know how long?

1:10:48.683 --> 1:10:49.718
It was two years.

1:10:49.751 --> 1:10:50.786
- Two years.
- Yeah.

1:10:50.819 --> 1:10:52.354
Oh, that's nice to know.

1:10:52.387 --> 1:10:55.257
<i>Given all the new information
Marcel shared with us...</i>

1:10:55.290 --> 1:10:58.626
And he had just, like
the same kind of man face,

1:10:58.659 --> 1:11:00.062
like two eyes,
that kind of thing.

1:11:00.095 --> 1:11:01.430
A mouth and all the teeth.

1:11:01.462 --> 1:11:05.533
<i>We were able
to track down Larissa Geller.</i>

1:11:05.566 --> 1:11:08.703
<i>We found her here
in the highlands of Guatemala</i>

1:11:08.737 --> 1:11:11.639
<i>working for
an environmental NGO.</i>

1:11:15.243 --> 1:11:17.846
<i>Geller then returned home</i>

1:11:17.879 --> 1:11:20.548
<i>and helped us locate this man,</i>

1:11:20.581 --> 1:11:23.085
<i>her former boyfriend,
Mark Booth.</i>

1:11:23.118 --> 1:11:25.562
<i>I don't even wanna do this.
You're really putting me
in a tough spot here...</i>

1:11:25.586 --> 1:11:26.931
<i>All right, I'll see you soon.
Come on.</i>

1:11:26.955 --> 1:11:28.522
<i>Okay, bye.
This is ridiculous.</i>

1:11:28.556 --> 1:11:29.858
<i>Wait, are you still...</i>

1:11:32.060 --> 1:11:33.895
<i>After some
brief introductions...</i>

1:11:33.929 --> 1:11:34.830
<i>- This is Mark.
- Hey, sorry.</i>

1:11:34.863 --> 1:11:36.630
It's kind of messy.
I'm just sort of...

1:11:36.664 --> 1:11:38.176
- So I was cleaning earlier.
- Right.

1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:39.509
<i>the search efforts began.</i>

1:11:39.533 --> 1:11:41.702
<i>I mean, I don't know.
This is...</i>

1:11:41.737 --> 1:11:42.914
I don't even know
where else to look.

1:11:42.938 --> 1:11:45.573
I honestly don't know what
to do. I don't know the area.

1:11:45.606 --> 1:11:47.575
This is definitely
the bag.

1:11:47.608 --> 1:11:48.777
So that... That is good news.

1:11:48.810 --> 1:11:51.279
I'm not gonna get... I'm not
gonna start to feel down...

1:11:51.313 --> 1:11:54.648
<i>And then
Marcel heard a familiar sound.</i>

1:11:54.682 --> 1:11:55.860
Yeah, and then
you just came over...

1:11:55.884 --> 1:11:58.186
<i>What our crew heard
was an argument.</i>

1:11:58.220 --> 1:11:59.788
You were on all of the emails...

1:11:59.821 --> 1:12:01.323
<i>But what Marcel heard...</i>

1:12:01.356 --> 1:12:02.991
<i>was the sounding of an alarm.</i>

1:12:03.025 --> 1:12:04.860
I'm a child?
Yes.

1:12:04.893 --> 1:12:07.129
Oh, dur, the sock drawer.
Did we check the sock drawer?

1:12:07.162 --> 1:12:08.997
<i>An alarm
he knew would send</i>

1:12:09.031 --> 1:12:11.199
<i>any shells into a shelter plan.</i>

1:12:11.233 --> 1:12:14.036
Geez, it's over here!

1:12:14.069 --> 1:12:17.005
Hey, guys! Over here!
Over here, I need a boost.

1:12:17.039 --> 1:12:19.241
Hey, I need to get to the top.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:12:19.274 --> 1:12:20.742
Open the top drawers, somebody.

1:12:22.310 --> 1:12:24.022
<i>Be careful.
Be very, very careful.</i>

1:12:24.046 --> 1:12:25.313
<i>Open, open. Careful.</i>

1:12:25.347 --> 1:12:28.717
<i>What followed

1:14:27.969 --> 1:14:30.272
Talk to Mario

Look at you.

1:16:05.867 --> 1:16:07.302
I missed your little face,
Marcel.

1:16:07.335 --> 1:16:09.580
I missed you so much.
I just want to squeeze you.

1:16:09.604 --> 1:16:11.373
Um, I'm just moving on.

1:16:12.574 --> 1:16:14.843
More so, I cried
from the beauty.

1:16:14.876 --> 1:16:17.946
Aw, Mr. Costas,
you're making me blush.

1:16:20.148 --> 1:16:22.126
Okay, but just put your weight
on the front foot...

1:16:22.150 --> 1:16:23.518
JUSTIN brother

1:16:23.551 --> 1:16:24.595
and then you unstick
the back one.
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.

1:16:24.619 --> 1:16:26.597
I know. Right,
but you have to keep doing it.

1:16:26.621 --> 1:16:27.723
I'm fine.

1:16:27.757 --> 1:16:29.467
Well, all right, but
do you see what's happening?

1:16:29.491 --> 1:16:31.026
- I know.
- Okay.

1:16:31.059 --> 1:16:34.329
She is really good, especially
for such a little one.

1:16:34.362 --> 1:16:35.563
But you know what it is?

1:16:35.597 --> 1:16:37.208
She has that thing that's like
when you're young,

1:16:37.232 --> 1:16:40.068
you have no fear 'cause you
haven't injured yourself yet,

1:16:40.101 --> 1:16:41.445
and you don't even know
what risk is.

1:16:41.469 --> 1:16:43.171
You just zoom around
all the time.

1:16:43.204 --> 1:16:44.939
Marcel, I'm being patient.

1:16:44.973 --> 1:16:46.574
Okay.
Marcel, come on.

1:16:46.608 --> 1:16:47.686
If you're trying
to be patient...

1:16:47.710 --> 1:16:50.011
Come out here with me,
and shake that little tush.

1:16:50.045 --> 1:16:51.079
Come on.
I will.

1:16:51.112 --> 1:16:53.124
I really promise I will take
a turn around the rink.

1:16:53.148 --> 1:16:54.392
I'm just kind of observing.
Dean, Dean, Dean, Dean.

1:16:54.416 --> 1:16:55.450
Yeah?
Please.

1:16:55.483 --> 1:16:57.419
This is the stock
that I come from.

1:16:57.452 --> 1:16:58.929
Dean.
You can see a direct line

1:16:58.953 --> 1:17:00.331
to Nana Connie with this one.

1:17:00.355 --> 1:17:01.189
Could you tell
your friend Marcel

1:17:01.222 --> 1:17:02.857
I'm not gonna wait forever,
please?

1:17:02.891 --> 1:17:04.526
Wow.

1:17:04.559 --> 1:17:06.137
It's nice to see you
back with everyone.

1:17:06.161 --> 1:17:08.229
Yeah.

1:17:08.263 --> 1:17:10.598
You know, you're welcome
back here any time you want.

1:17:13.935 --> 1:17:16.471
Thanks.
Mmm-hmm.

1:17:16.504 --> 1:17:18.873
You're welcome to
my house any time you want.

1:17:18.907 --> 1:17:20.208
You don't have a house.

1:17:20.241 --> 1:17:21.476
I will soon.

1:17:21.509 --> 1:17:22.377
- I signed a lease.
- Pay attention.

1:17:22.410 --> 1:17:24.045
Each of you...
Oh. Well, then, I accept.

1:17:24.079 --> 1:17:25.519
One, two, three.

1:17:27.482 --> 1:17:30.418
Come on,
Marcel. Come on. Let's go.

1:17:30.452 --> 1:17:32.120
We're going ice skating.

1:17:32.153 --> 1:17:32.987
We're going
on the ice skating rink.

1:17:33.021 --> 1:17:34.465
Yeah,
I saw you skating before.

1:17:35.825 --> 1:17:39.227
<i>It is different now after
living alone for so long.</i>

1:17:39.260 --> 1:17:42.263
<i>I find that sometimes
being in a big group is...</i>

1:17:42.297 --> 1:17:44.666
This is what
I wanna be doing.
I want to slide down.

1:17:44.699 --> 1:17:46.310
Good. I didn't know
that that's what you were

1:17:46.334 --> 1:17:48.334
trying to do. I thought
you were asking me how I...

1:17:48.937 --> 1:17:51.539
<i>Can be
overwhelming to me.</i>

1:17:54.275 --> 1:17:57.112
You guys, there's...
I need to learn.

1:17:59.214 --> 1:18:01.950
<i>I needed somewhere
that I could come and just...</i>

1:18:12.060 --> 1:18:15.130
<i>I found myself coming down
here more and more.</i>

1:18:18.066 --> 1:18:20.168
<i>Such a lovely smell
from the dryer sheets.</i>

1:18:21.302 --> 1:18:24.105
<i>And I... I like it because</i>

1:18:25.006 --> 1:18:26.174
<i>there's a window</i>

1:18:26.207 --> 1:18:28.376
<i>that is always opened
a little crack there.</i>

1:18:31.312 --> 1:18:33.148
<i>I would stand there,</i>

1:18:33.181 --> 1:18:36.217
<i>and sometimes I'd tell her
things, ask for advice,</i>

1:18:36.251 --> 1:18:39.154
<i>or just let sounds
come out of my mouth.</i>

1:18:40.221 --> 1:18:42.190
<i>And one day, I was just sitting,</i>

1:18:43.191 --> 1:18:44.559
<i>and the wind blew in,</i>

1:18:44.592 --> 1:18:49.631
<i>and it blew just over the top
of my head in such a way.</i>

1:18:50.999 --> 1:18:52.100
<i>And the wind blew over,</i>

1:18:52.133 --> 1:18:54.469
<i>and it made
a beautiful whistling sound.</i>

1:18:56.438 --> 1:18:57.548
What kind
of noise is it?

1:18:57.572 --> 1:18:59.240
Wait, shh, shh. Listen.

1:19:00.408 --> 1:19:02.343
Can you hear it?

1:19:05.313 --> 1:19:08.683
That's it.
That's going through my shell.

1:19:10.585 --> 1:19:16.291
<i>It felt just like her
to lead me to a place</i>

1:19:16.324 --> 1:19:19.394
<i>where I would experience
something new and special.</i>

1:19:24.432 --> 1:19:27.669
<i>It connected me
how I felt like to everything,</i>

1:19:27.702 --> 1:19:33.141
<i>because if I wasn't there,
the sound never would exist.</i>

1:19:33.174 --> 1:19:37.445
<i>And I felt like
everything was in pieces,</i>

1:19:37.479 --> 1:19:38.646
<i>and then I stood there,</i>

1:19:38.680 --> 1:19:41.349
<i>and suddenly,
we were one large instrument.</i>

1:19:44.419 --> 1:19:46.554
<i>I like to go there a lot</i>

1:19:46.588 --> 1:19:48.389
<i>because it reminds me</i>

1:19:48.423 --> 1:19:52.627
<i>that I'm not
just one separate piece</i>

1:19:52.660 --> 1:19:55.463
<i>rattling around in this place,</i>

1:19:55.497 --> 1:19:59.300
<i>but that I'm part of a whole.</i>

1:19:59.334 --> 1:20:03.338
<i>And I truly enjoy
the sound of myself</i>

1:20:03.371 --> 1:20:05.006
<i>connected to everything.</i>

1:20:37.438 --> 1:20:38.582
I'm gonna let him out.
Are you ready?

1:20:38.606 --> 1:20:40.608
All right.
Release the hounds!

1:20:40.642 --> 1:20:41.777
Come on, do it.

1:20:41.810 --> 1:20:43.344
I'm actually really excited
to see him.

1:20:43.378 --> 1:20:44.655
Here it comes.

1:20:44.679 --> 1:20:47.549
Hi, bud! Oh, boo-boo.
Come here, bubba.

1:20:47.582 --> 1:20:49.517
How are you, pal?

1:20:49.551 --> 1:20:51.119
Aw, he remembers you!

1:20:51.152 --> 1:20:52.788
Ah! Ugh. Ew.

1:20:52.821 --> 1:20:54.098
Oh, you remember Marcel?

1:20:54.122 --> 1:20:55.399
Oh, you smell.
Oh, my goodness.

1:20:55.423 --> 1:20:57.793
He has a new smell.
It's... Is he sick?

1:20:57.826 --> 1:20:59.294
<i>I switched him
to wet food,</i>

1:20:59.327 --> 1:21:00.604
<i>and it's made
his breath go crazy.</i>

1:21:00.628 --> 1:21:04.165
It is a very dense,
very rich aroma.

1:21:04.198 --> 1:21:05.567
- Arthur!
- Wow.

1:21:05.600 --> 1:21:07.635
<i>So, you guys got wet dog food.</i>

1:21:07.669 --> 1:21:09.604
- Yeah.
- You got a balcony.

1:21:09.637 --> 1:21:11.382
- Yeah, we got the cool view.
- That's nice.

1:21:11.406 --> 1:21:13.174
I see you have
some flowers here.

1:21:13.207 --> 1:21:14.251
Oh, yeah. They're nice.

1:21:14.275 --> 1:21:16.377
<i>They're from, uh, a bike path.</i>

1:21:16.411 --> 1:21:17.378
<i>There's a bike path that goes
in front of my place.</i>

1:21:17.412 --> 1:21:19.414
Uh-huh.
Who gave you these flowers?

1:21:19.447 --> 1:21:20.491
No one gave them to me.

1:21:20.515 --> 1:21:21.382
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:21:21.416 --> 1:21:22.350
- Okay.
- I picked them myself.

1:21:22.383 --> 1:21:23.460
Oh, really?
'Cause we had a garden

1:21:23.484 --> 1:21:25.687
at our place. I never
saw you picking any flowers.

1:21:27.422 --> 1:21:28.566
<i>I wanted
to make the place nice.</i>

1:21:28.590 --> 1:21:29.792
<i>A friend was coming over.</i>

1:21:29.825 --> 1:21:31.794
<i>- Ah, a friend.
- Yes, I had a friend.</i>

1:21:31.827 --> 1:21:32.795
<i>What kind of a friend?</i>

1:21:32.828 --> 1:21:34.005
<i>- She is a girl.
- Really?</i>

1:21:34.029 --> 1:21:36.364
Would you like to
see the rest of the apartment?

1:21:36.397 --> 1:21:38.901
Would you
like to change the subject?

1:21:40.736 --> 1:21:43.204
Yes, I want to see it.

1:21:43.237 --> 1:21:44.707
<i>- Hop on.
- Oh, thanks.</i>

1:21:45.941 --> 1:21:48.844
All right,
so, here's my room.

1:21:48.877 --> 1:21:52.447
Oh!
More flowers in here, huh?

1:21:52.480 --> 1:21:54.850
Yeah,
more flowers in here.

1:21:54.883 --> 1:21:57.619
Hit... Hitting
that bike path pretty hard.

1:21:57.652 --> 1:21:59.822
Actually, those are
from the farmer's market.
