WEBVTT

00:00.133 --> 00:01.967
Previously on The Fosters...

00:02.101 --> 00:03.702
I think we both know that
she's everything that I'm not.

00:03.735 --> 00:04.803
And nothing that I wanna be.

00:04.837 --> 00:06.871
So really you just wanted
to use me... for sex.

00:06.991 --> 00:08.053
I thought you were different.

00:08.053 --> 00:09.522
What do I have to do to prove it to you?

00:09.642 --> 00:11.524
- It's about Dani.
- What happened?

00:11.644 --> 00:13.459
We had sex.

00:13.463 --> 00:15.869
... and I, we're working
the program together.

00:15.989 --> 00:18.149
I pray I can do better for this baby,

00:18.184 --> 00:19.500
than I did for my twins.

00:19.860 --> 00:22.087
Sorry I was being such a bitch.

00:23.089 --> 00:24.956
I'm having a hard time right now.

00:24.990 --> 00:27.507
- No, you're allowed.
- What's going on with you?

00:27.687 --> 00:29.641
- Is it Wyatt?
- We're kinda taking a break.

00:29.675 --> 00:32.397
Idyllwild would like
to offer you a full ride

00:32.430 --> 00:34.064
to their summer music program.

00:35.104 --> 00:38.162
Yeah, I know, it's just one of the most
prestigious programs in the country.

00:38.181 --> 00:41.063
I can't sign the papers
again. I can't abandon you.

00:41.183 --> 00:43.095
- I love you.
- I don't love you.

00:43.114 --> 00:44.811
I'm never going to get out to him.

00:44.888 --> 00:46.234
And I know that.

00:50.414 --> 00:51.922
So, I'm not gonna graduate?

00:51.944 --> 00:53.766
No, that is not what we're saying.

00:53.767 --> 00:55.639
But I took World History at Jefferson.

00:55.670 --> 00:58.149
And obviously I took Algebra,
I'm in Algebra II now.

00:58.269 --> 01:01.132
Yes, I know, and I'm gonna do everything
I can to find those transcripts,

01:01.154 --> 01:02.180
and get those credits, but...

01:02.188 --> 01:04.828
So I'm gonna have to take all
of these classes over again?

01:04.875 --> 01:07.737
Hopefully not. But even if I
do find all of your records,

01:07.857 --> 01:09.332
you're still gonna need
to go to summer school.

01:09.620 --> 01:10.805
Awesome.

01:10.825 --> 01:12.726
And we should probably
come up with some kind of

01:12.726 --> 01:14.170
independent study project for you.

01:14.179 --> 01:17.956
We know this is unfair, and I wish
we could just, fix everything, love...

01:17.967 --> 01:19.411
It's out of your hands. Yeah, I get it.

01:19.445 --> 01:21.513
With a plan, we can get you through this.

01:21.544 --> 01:23.488
Yeah, unless I have to
live with the Quinns,

01:23.496 --> 01:25.553
and I'm going to some private school

01:25.565 --> 01:29.340
where they tell me my credits from
Anchor Beach didn't even transfer.

01:29.355 --> 01:31.938
We're not going to let Robert, or
anyone else, take you out of this house.

01:31.965 --> 01:33.687
CPS took me when your

01:33.707 --> 01:34.982
your foster license expired,

01:35.165 --> 01:36.658
and there was nothing
you could do about that.

01:40.438 --> 01:42.801
I'm sorry. I'm just...

01:42.835 --> 01:45.004
We know. We know.

01:46.643 --> 01:49.588
So guess who got the
highest score in her grade

01:49.610 --> 01:52.277
on the math evaluations! Ninety-eight!

01:54.006 --> 01:57.836
That's incredible, Mariana.
Great job! You're amazing.

01:57.866 --> 01:59.461
We're sorry, honey, that is amazing.

01:59.490 --> 02:00.812
- We are very proud of you.
- That's awesome.

02:00.831 --> 02:02.717
I guess I'll just have to wait
until they announce my name

02:02.751 --> 02:04.838
at the assembly this week
to get the props I deserve.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.608
- Honey, really?
- I'm kidding, it's fine.

02:07.806 --> 02:10.436
But guess what else? You know
Craig, Craig the math teacher?

02:10.883 --> 02:12.327
He wants me to join STEM.

02:12.537 --> 02:13.932
Well that sounds fun.

02:14.992 --> 02:15.837
What is it?

02:15.876 --> 02:17.889
Uh, Science, Technology,

02:17.928 --> 02:18.852
Something, and Math.

02:18.866 --> 02:20.980
It's like computer club,
but like a team or something.

02:21.043 --> 02:24.431
And they go to like, coding competitions
and stuff. It's kind of a big deal.

02:25.214 --> 02:26.319
If you do say so yourself.

02:26.353 --> 02:28.296
Well, apparently no one else is going to.

02:29.015 --> 02:30.677
OK, when's dinner? I'm starved.

02:30.697 --> 02:32.651
In a few minutes, go ahead and go wash up.

02:32.694 --> 02:33.392
OK.

02:38.298 --> 02:40.641
- Can I... ?
- Yeah.

02:41.101 --> 02:42.568
Hey...

02:43.157 --> 02:44.961
we love you.

02:45.283 --> 02:46.793
I love you, too.

02:49.764 --> 02:51.245
God, I hate seeing her like this.

02:51.264 --> 02:53.019
She's... looks so defeated.

02:53.044 --> 02:55.753
Yeah, well, can you blame her? It's just
been one thing after another for her.

02:55.778 --> 02:57.577
No, I know, but

02:57.601 --> 02:59.715
we have got to help her graduate.

03:00.135 --> 03:04.390
Graduating from high school is the single
most important thing that a foster kid can do.

03:04.631 --> 03:06.698
A foster kid? That's what
we're calling her now?

03:06.941 --> 03:07.737
Well,

03:07.938 --> 03:10.472
until the court decides
otherwise, it's what she is.

03:30.832 --> 03:32.332
Hello?

03:32.959 --> 03:34.174
Hey.

03:34.706 --> 03:36.112
What?

03:36.766 --> 03:38.580
OK, slow down.

03:44.533 --> 03:46.431
Stef, Stef...

03:46.551 --> 03:48.734
I need your help.

03:54.008 --> 03:55.675
You don't wanna hurt anyone!

03:55.710 --> 03:58.578
- We don't have...
- Where the hell is it?!

03:58.698 --> 04:00.016
Come on, man, before you hurt someone.

04:01.055 --> 04:02.597
Police! Drop it, drop the knife!

04:02.604 --> 04:05.497
Drop the knife! Drop the
knife! Get on the ground!

04:05.533 --> 04:07.271
- On the ground!
- OK, OK.

04:07.391 --> 04:09.422
Both of you, on the ground now!

04:09.457 --> 04:10.747
- On the ground!
- We live here!

04:10.753 --> 04:12.339
- You two, down,
- There are kids here!

04:12.360 --> 04:14.361
Both of you, on the ground, now!

04:17.375 --> 04:18.670
Where are they?

04:19.235 --> 04:20.848
Where are the kids?

04:20.968 --> 04:22.617
- I...
- Where are they?!

04:22.638 --> 04:23.837
The bedroom.

04:25.793 --> 04:27.908
Face down, on the ground.

04:27.942 --> 04:29.325
Is anybody in there?

04:29.445 --> 04:31.290
Hands behind your back. I
said hands behind your back.

04:31.410 --> 04:33.198
Hello.

04:33.236 --> 04:36.777
Um... listen, the police are
here, and you're safe, you're fine.

04:36.796 --> 04:39.586
Can you, uh, can you open the door?

04:44.010 --> 04:45.624
Hi, honey.

04:45.744 --> 04:48.199
I'm with the police, you
see my badge right there?

04:48.199 --> 04:49.551
Can you open up the door?

04:49.671 --> 04:50.766
Yeah?

05:29.103 --> 05:33.503
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:35.538 --> 05:37.683
He was talking all kinds of crazy,

05:37.712 --> 05:40.873
saying they stole his stash, and
next thing you know, he pulls a knife.

05:41.082 --> 05:43.870
So I grabbed the girls, locked
us in the bedroom, and called you.

05:43.964 --> 05:46.123
Why didn't your foster
parents call the police?

05:46.123 --> 05:48.441
I dunno. He's their friend or somethin'.

05:48.561 --> 05:49.613
The sketchy guy?

05:50.513 --> 05:51.752
Damn. I mean,

05:52.135 --> 05:54.286
I've been in some bad
foster homes before, but

05:54.523 --> 05:55.975
never anything like that.

05:56.177 --> 05:58.456
- Well, at least you're safe now.
- Yeah, tonight,

05:58.565 --> 06:00.370
who knows where they gonna put me next.

06:03.630 --> 06:05.374
What about you?

06:05.787 --> 06:07.155
What's going on with you?

06:08.079 --> 06:09.019
Um...

06:11.292 --> 06:13.066
well, Robert's trying to get custody.

06:13.279 --> 06:14.172
For real?

06:14.190 --> 06:16.736
Yeah, I have to have visitations with him

06:16.766 --> 06:17.714
every week.

06:18.530 --> 06:21.487
It's not the same as you, like, at all,

06:21.889 --> 06:24.902
but I keep thinking, like maybe,

06:25.042 --> 06:26.780
maybe now, maybe this time,

06:26.900 --> 06:29.003
I'll be out of the
system for good, you know?

06:29.039 --> 06:30.121
And they just keep...

06:30.838 --> 06:32.825
pulling me back.

06:33.171 --> 06:35.844
I just wanna be in one
place for a while, you know?

06:36.410 --> 06:38.464
Even if it ain't as nice as this one.

06:42.219 --> 06:43.738
I hope...

06:44.061 --> 06:46.544
I hope you get that.

07:05.474 --> 07:06.969
Stoned much?

07:10.999 --> 07:12.727
Planning to go to class?

07:13.800 --> 07:16.282
So you trying to get kicked out of school?

07:16.544 --> 07:18.451
What the hell do you care?

07:21.756 --> 07:23.047
Please don't tell me
you're not acting like this

07:23.167 --> 07:25.345
-  because we broke up.
- Yeah, Callie,

07:25.601 --> 07:28.440
you're the reason for every
single thing that I do.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.774
OK, I don't even wipe the sleep
outta my eyes in the morning

07:30.774 --> 07:32.680
without wondering what
you're going think about it.

07:33.970 --> 07:35.087
Wow.

07:39.689 --> 07:40.699
Peace.

07:52.647 --> 07:53.816
Well?

07:54.409 --> 07:56.603
Not the best falafel in San Diego.

07:56.723 --> 07:59.201
What? You cannot be serious.

07:59.321 --> 08:00.447
A close second.

08:00.736 --> 08:02.657
To mine.

08:02.710 --> 08:03.917
Well, I will be the judge of that.

08:04.037 --> 08:06.097
- Next time, you're bringing lunch.
- Mmm, OK.

08:07.039 --> 08:09.682
We need to do this more
often. It's been too long.

08:10.130 --> 08:11.482
I know.

08:13.100 --> 08:15.431
I've been meaning to check in with you,

08:15.796 --> 08:17.079
but um...

08:17.551 --> 08:19.867
... after you lost the baby, I...

08:21.143 --> 08:23.559
- I just didn't know what to say.
- It's OK.

08:23.802 --> 08:25.131
I get it.

08:27.636 --> 08:29.011
And how about you?

08:30.143 --> 08:32.452
Are you, OK?

08:33.203 --> 08:35.261
I am, mostly.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.874
Work's a good distraction.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.456
So

08:40.760 --> 08:42.263
what do you think about, Monty?

08:42.764 --> 08:43.767
So far.

08:43.964 --> 08:45.255
Well,

08:45.992 --> 08:48.005
I had my reservations, as you know,

08:48.125 --> 08:49.501
but she's pretty great.

08:49.782 --> 08:51.392
She's leaving the academics to me,

08:51.415 --> 08:54.202
and she has some amazing
fund-raising ideas.

08:54.263 --> 08:55.229
I think

08:55.405 --> 08:57.356
for the first time in a very long time,

08:58.121 --> 08:59.580
we're in good hands.

08:59.628 --> 09:02.046
Wow. Sounds like she's really won you over.

09:02.228 --> 09:03.315
I wouldn't go that far.

09:09.744 --> 09:10.589
Look,

09:11.014 --> 09:13.615
- look, I'm sorry, all right?
- Whatever.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.523
I don't get it, Jesus.

09:16.276 --> 09:17.764
You say you like me,

09:17.934 --> 09:20.540
you say you care about me,
and then you just blow me off.

09:20.967 --> 09:23.373
I really wanted you to see
me at the dance competition.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.309
No, I just...

09:24.740 --> 09:26.994
remember, you said we have
to be there for people.

09:27.948 --> 09:29.662
I was talking about me.

09:30.519 --> 09:32.366
- Your girlfriend.
- I know,

09:32.543 --> 09:33.928
- but Ana...
- Your birth mom?

09:34.201 --> 09:35.325
What about her?

09:36.796 --> 09:38.552
She's pregnant, OK?

09:38.880 --> 09:41.056
- The crack-head?
- She's not a crack-head.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.522
Not anymore.

09:45.254 --> 09:46.852
How'd you find out?

09:47.119 --> 09:48.851
I went to one of her AA meetings.

09:48.857 --> 09:50.242
She was telling everyone.

09:50.254 --> 09:53.159
I got so weirded out, I
left before she saw me.

09:54.211 --> 09:55.561
What'd Mariana say?

09:55.595 --> 09:56.556
She doesn't know,

09:57.200 --> 09:58.591
and you can't tell her.

09:58.616 --> 10:00.666
She'll freak out, she'll tell my moms.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.729
And then I'm screwed. OK?

10:06.405 --> 10:07.373
OK.

10:09.291 --> 10:11.575
I'm still bummed you missed my solo,

10:12.043 --> 10:13.623
you're gonna have to make it up to me.

10:13.743 --> 10:14.559
Promise.

10:16.114 --> 10:18.095
So, who's the baby daddy?

10:21.828 --> 10:25.169
- What if it's, Mike?
- Who's Mike?

10:27.049 --> 10:28.694
OK, so there are two generals,

10:28.724 --> 10:30.766
with armies, on either side of a city.

10:31.042 --> 10:33.033
Now both armies have to
attack at the same time,

10:33.057 --> 10:35.045
otherwise the lone attacker is defeated.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.140
- So, they just have to agree...
- Mind if I...

10:37.158 --> 10:38.191
No.

10:40.269 --> 10:42.408
But, what're you doing here?

10:42.453 --> 10:43.593
I was invited.

10:43.713 --> 10:45.385
... if a message has been delivered.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.349
How do you create a formula

10:47.416 --> 10:49.232
to be 100 percent sure

10:49.593 --> 10:51.409
that the armies attack at the same time?

10:51.456 --> 10:52.313
Hm?

10:53.364 --> 10:54.768
Uh, you can't.

10:57.052 --> 10:59.549
Well, there's always be some uncertainty,

10:59.567 --> 11:00.971
it's a trick question, right?

11:01.305 --> 11:02.812
That's right.

11:03.043 --> 11:04.580
- Now, I'm gonna walk the rest of you...
- Wow,

11:04.605 --> 11:05.958
never woulda thought Jesus' sister

11:05.982 --> 11:07.834
would turn out to be a math whiz.

11:08.393 --> 11:10.464
Was that even a math question?

11:11.616 --> 11:13.774
And please tell me you know
I'm nothing like my brother.

11:13.809 --> 11:15.058
No,

11:15.792 --> 11:16.750
I do.

11:18.251 --> 11:19.865
Look... I'm sorry about how

11:19.928 --> 11:21.197
all that went down.

11:21.377 --> 11:22.956
With Hayley and everything.

11:23.076 --> 11:23.735
It's cool.

11:24.055 --> 11:25.086
Don't worry about it.

11:25.830 --> 11:29.067
If it helps, I like
you way better than her.

11:30.433 --> 11:32.155
That does help.

11:32.738 --> 11:33.910
A little.

11:35.387 --> 11:37.701
But I don't think Hayley
was even the problem.

11:40.512 --> 11:43.702
I think we were done as soon
as I became his math tutor.

11:44.461 --> 11:45.724
He just

11:45.844 --> 11:47.974
couldn't deal with me
being smarter than him.

11:49.265 --> 11:50.765
But I'm glad that you're here.

11:52.175 --> 11:54.309
Between this and wrestling,
I was starting to think

11:54.324 --> 11:56.390
that I was the only person
in the world without a penis.

11:58.357 --> 12:02.207
And it's not gonna be some
kind of crazy, drug-fueled,

12:02.245 --> 12:03.643
trashing hotels kinda tour.

12:03.688 --> 12:05.208
We're just going to be
playing like skate parks,

12:05.238 --> 12:07.813
small clubs maybe a
fair if we can book one.

12:07.851 --> 12:10.965
And we'll crash with friends, or
sleep in the van if we have to.

12:13.752 --> 12:15.332
Or, you know, we'll

12:15.567 --> 12:17.868
set aside enough money to make sure we're

12:17.876 --> 12:19.197
staying in motels.

12:19.501 --> 12:22.486
You know, nice ones.
Clean ones. Like chains.

12:23.693 --> 12:26.518
And I'll do SAT prep online

12:26.541 --> 12:29.678
and I'll make sure I'm working on
my summer reading list in the van.

12:29.724 --> 12:32.139
I mean, most of the our time will
be spent driving anyways, so...

12:33.803 --> 12:36.301
Not on freeways or anything like that.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.358
Or night, just...

12:40.865 --> 12:44.077
Look, it's gonna be really cool.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.781
And it's a chance to see
a little bit of the world

12:46.826 --> 12:48.657
while I do something I love.

12:48.885 --> 12:51.056
Well, you've given us a lot to think about,

12:51.079 --> 12:53.054
just give us some time.

12:54.041 --> 12:55.044
OK.

12:55.819 --> 12:56.973
All right.

12:57.565 --> 12:59.380
But, you know, as you're deliberating,

12:59.409 --> 13:01.427
I just want you to think
of this as less of a tour

13:01.433 --> 13:03.094
- and more of like a right of passage.
- OK.

13:03.098 --> 13:05.097
That's good. That's enough. Thank you.

13:05.443 --> 13:07.278
All right.

13:09.958 --> 13:11.835
Well, that was good for a laugh.

13:12.248 --> 13:14.484
I just mean, come on, we're not
gonna let him go on the road. Right?

13:14.544 --> 13:16.841
It's the summer before his senior year.

13:16.841 --> 13:20.194
Colleges are gonna wanna see an
internships and study programs,

13:20.206 --> 13:21.992
and not from the, Sid
Vicious School of Rock'n'Roll.

13:22.181 --> 13:23.335
Sid Vicious?

13:23.390 --> 13:24.748
You forget, I used to be cool.

13:25.152 --> 13:26.630
All right, so you guys wanna tell him,

13:26.653 --> 13:27.723
or you want me to take the heat this time?

13:27.752 --> 13:29.803
Well, I mean let's hold
on here for a second,

13:29.807 --> 13:32.424
I think maybe he should go.

13:33.925 --> 13:34.769
You, what?

13:34.847 --> 13:36.950
Who are you and what have
you done with my wife?

13:40.299 --> 13:40.936
Hey.

13:41.897 --> 13:42.970
What's he doing here?

13:43.160 --> 13:43.689
Uh,

13:43.809 --> 13:45.731
- good to see you, too, Jesus.
- Jesus.

13:46.074 --> 13:47.726
Sorry, that came out wrong.

13:47.781 --> 13:49.632
Would you like to back
up and try that again?

13:51.541 --> 13:52.936
Hey, Mike, how's it going?

13:53.480 --> 13:54.647
Good, bud, how's wrestling?

13:55.385 --> 13:56.116
Good.

14:04.846 --> 14:07.284
- Chatty.
- Teenage.

14:09.151 --> 14:09.789
Hey.

14:10.928 --> 14:11.776
Hey.

14:12.133 --> 14:14.278
- They reach a verdict?
- Uh,

14:14.307 --> 14:15.724
still deliberating.

14:15.778 --> 14:17.773
Two against one. One being in favor.

14:18.438 --> 14:20.149
Wow, poor Lena.

14:20.231 --> 14:22.401
Having to fend for
herself against two cops.

14:23.058 --> 14:24.271
Actually, it's Mom.

14:24.975 --> 14:26.884
No way, Stef's pro tour?

14:27.004 --> 14:29.069
It's weird, right? It's like
Freaky Friday down there.

14:29.085 --> 14:30.594
Yeah.

14:33.809 --> 14:35.937
You didn't tell them
about Idyllwild, did you?

14:36.955 --> 14:37.608
No.

14:37.728 --> 14:38.999
Yeah, if they find out about that,

14:39.011 --> 14:40.648
there's no way they're
letting you go on tour.

14:44.746 --> 14:46.788
Don't worry, I'm not gonna say anything.

14:54.922 --> 14:55.774
Sweetheart.

14:57.982 --> 15:00.847
Can we talk to you for a moment?

15:01.777 --> 15:02.578
About Ana.

15:04.370 --> 15:05.116
Why?

15:06.795 --> 15:07.674
Well,

15:07.841 --> 15:10.268
Mom told me how hard it was for you,

15:10.466 --> 15:11.924
when Ana made her amends.

15:11.951 --> 15:13.883
I just, don't like seeing girls cry.

15:14.175 --> 15:15.601
It's not just about that.

15:15.640 --> 15:17.565
You have a connection with her.

15:17.612 --> 15:18.666
And that's OK.

15:19.195 --> 15:21.026
What's not OK is ignoring the fact

15:21.069 --> 15:23.370
that you are a child of an addict.

15:23.988 --> 15:26.119
So if you decide you want to see Ana again,

15:26.130 --> 15:27.620
we'd like you to be prepared.

15:28.292 --> 15:30.442
We want you to start
going to Alateen meetings.

15:30.562 --> 15:32.717
What is that? Like, AA for teens?

15:32.744 --> 15:35.392
No, no, no, it's for teenagers

15:35.823 --> 15:37.523
whose parents or family members,

15:37.534 --> 15:39.017
are alcoholics or addicts.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.031
It's just a

15:40.066 --> 15:42.617
way  to help you guys figure
out how to deal with it all.

15:43.014 --> 15:43.971
Do I have to?

15:44.091 --> 15:46.257
I don't even know if I
want to see Ana again.

15:46.541 --> 15:47.843
You say that now.

15:47.917 --> 15:48.597
But

15:49.076 --> 15:51.210
in a few weeks, or months, who
knows how you're gonna feel?

15:51.533 --> 15:52.275
Hey, Mom.

15:52.874 --> 15:55.048
Hey, B, good timing. Come
here, love. Come here.

15:55.317 --> 15:58.676
Um, you have been to a few
Alateen meetings, haven't you?

15:58.730 --> 16:00.557
- Yeah, sure.
- Hm?

16:01.875 --> 16:04.740
Um... yeah, it's super
cool. You should totally go.

16:05.358 --> 16:05.992
See,

16:06.427 --> 16:08.601
you wouldn't be in this
alone, Brandon'll take you.

16:08.641 --> 16:09.442
What?

16:09.562 --> 16:10.539
Why do I have to go?

16:11.180 --> 16:13.454
Because it would be really
good for both of you.

16:16.752 --> 16:18.187
So they're selling kids now, is that it?

16:18.404 --> 16:19.917
That's not how I'd describe it.

16:19.936 --> 16:22.079
Then how do you explain
putting kids in an apartment

16:22.118 --> 16:24.198
where the adults that
are responsible for them

16:24.210 --> 16:26.056
are letting meth addicts in the front door?

16:26.114 --> 16:27.468
- Stef...
- Well, what?

16:27.514 --> 16:28.937
It's money, isn't it?

16:28.956 --> 16:30.546
I mean, this is exactly why you cannot

16:30.561 --> 16:32.210
privatize things like foster care.

16:32.218 --> 16:34.447
- Foster care is not privatized.
- OK, then what would you call it?

16:34.532 --> 16:38.123
The county contracts with some
private agencies to place more kids.

16:38.129 --> 16:39.167
There just aren't enough homes.

16:39.183 --> 16:41.808
And those agencies get paid
more based on the number

16:41.823 --> 16:43.663
of homes they find and
kids they place. Correct?

16:43.671 --> 16:44.896
So they're incentivized

16:44.919 --> 16:47.178
to approve people who may
or may not be qualified.

16:47.466 --> 16:49.749
Well, unfortunately, that's
really not for us to decide.

16:49.761 --> 16:53.069
Are you not part of
Child Protective Services?

16:53.368 --> 16:55.934
Who else is gonna decide
these things, exactly?

16:57.021 --> 16:59.555
I can't... he won't
answer. I don't understand.

16:59.574 --> 17:02.476
As long as Kiara doesn't have
to go back into that house.

17:06.364 --> 17:08.665
You are not sending
her back there. Are you?

17:09.944 --> 17:12.079
I know people in Vegas. I'll
just go there and lay low.

17:12.317 --> 17:15.069
"Lay low" with who? Other runaways?
You know that's not gonna work.

17:15.089 --> 17:16.896
I don't care, I'm not
going back to that place!

17:16.915 --> 17:18.696
You're just gonna end up back in juvie.

17:19.386 --> 17:19.992
OK, look,

17:20.280 --> 17:21.602
you don't see me running.

17:21.621 --> 17:23.029
Don't you get it?

17:24.156 --> 17:26.719
My foster parents know I narc'd on them.

17:27.705 --> 17:29.767
You think they're going to
welcome be back with open arms?

17:36.611 --> 17:37.237
So...

17:37.563 --> 17:39.978
I was looking over our API scores.

17:40.157 --> 17:41.806
And can we talk about Mariana?

17:41.926 --> 17:44.143
Top in her class in Math? How about that!

17:44.205 --> 17:46.120
I know, pretty great, right?

17:46.240 --> 17:47.399
We're so proud of her.

17:47.640 --> 17:49.802
Well, the whole school
did well in Math, in fact,

17:49.962 --> 17:51.047
it's very impressive.

17:51.167 --> 17:51.883
Thank you.

17:52.442 --> 17:54.527
English on the other hand,

17:54.593 --> 17:55.627
not so much.

17:55.833 --> 18:00.044
The scores are... low, and if we wanna
qualify for the kind of grants we need,

18:00.095 --> 18:01.861
well, we gotta get 'em up.

18:01.981 --> 18:05.100
In a fiscal crisis like
we're in, it's a big issue.

18:05.162 --> 18:06.042
I hear you.

18:06.205 --> 18:08.370
We need to get on top of this right away.

18:08.433 --> 18:11.314
We've gotta make some changes to
our curriculum, as soon as possible,

18:11.583 --> 18:13.664
so are you up for speaking with Timothy?

18:13.691 --> 18:15.887
I mean since he's the head
of the English Department?

18:31.745 --> 18:32.679
Well?

18:33.103 --> 18:34.094
Well, what?

18:34.118 --> 18:35.008
Well?  How was it?

18:35.233 --> 18:37.104
I want to make sure it's
good before I show it to Tia.

18:37.275 --> 18:38.387
Oh, it's good.

18:38.651 --> 18:39.343
It is?

18:39.569 --> 18:40.548
Oh yeah.

18:40.766 --> 18:41.606
It's sexy.

18:42.644 --> 18:43.748
- It is?
- Yeah.

18:44.129 --> 18:45.487
You're sexy.

18:46.893 --> 18:47.683
What?

18:48.678 --> 18:51.300
- Nobody's ever called me sexy before.
- Well, you are,

18:51.774 --> 18:53.135
very sexy.

18:54.235 --> 18:56.222
Especially when you dance.

19:00.857 --> 19:03.100
- What?
- I gotta go, STEM.

19:04.279 --> 19:05.022
Really?

19:05.869 --> 19:07.892
Maybe I should join STEM, I killed it

19:07.961 --> 19:09.170
on the math evaluation.

19:09.209 --> 19:10.403
- Did you?
- Yup.

19:10.831 --> 19:11.725
Ninety-two,

19:12.192 --> 19:13.245
thank you very much.

19:13.304 --> 19:15.435
- Wow. That's great.
- How'd you do?

19:15.975 --> 19:18.323
Oh, OK.

19:18.677 --> 19:19.381
Eighty-eight.

19:20.843 --> 19:23.080
Eighty-eight's super good, above average!

19:23.643 --> 19:25.218
Yep, that's me,

19:25.490 --> 19:26.703
above average.

19:27.383 --> 19:28.569
OK, gotta go.

19:29.215 --> 19:29.860
Bye.

19:38.822 --> 19:39.553
Hey.

19:42.461 --> 19:44.899
Uh, so, I've been thinkin'...

19:45.187 --> 19:46.048
... about the tour.

19:48.741 --> 19:49.633
Are you OK?

19:50.584 --> 19:52.061
Yeah, I'm just...

19:52.124 --> 19:53.403
got a lot on my mind, what's up?

19:54.491 --> 19:55.957
What's going on?

19:56.801 --> 19:58.559
Uh, Callie's friend, Kiara

19:58.629 --> 20:01.211
we pulled her out of a pretty messed
up foster home the other night.

20:01.693 --> 20:04.026
And Social Services is
sending her back tomorrow.

20:05.098 --> 20:07.062
Well, I wish I could
say I find that shocking.

20:07.132 --> 20:08.240
Yeah, right.

20:08.505 --> 20:11.125
And then I'm pretty sure they're dealing.

20:11.529 --> 20:12.645
Really?

20:12.703 --> 20:13.815
Yeah, why else would you

20:14.017 --> 20:15.903
let a tweaker into your house
in the middle of the night?

20:16.023 --> 20:18.077
Unless you're planning on
doing a little business.

20:18.584 --> 20:20.081
So, I, uh...

20:21.442 --> 20:23.763
I'm thinking about making a house call.

20:26.329 --> 20:27.546
Want some back up?

20:31.516 --> 20:32.519
What is this?

20:32.970 --> 20:34.797
I used to go here for group.

20:34.831 --> 20:36.882
It's like drop-in center for foster kids.

20:37.002 --> 20:38.002
Drop in for what?

20:38.266 --> 20:41.237
Like, therapy, support groups, legal help.

20:45.737 --> 20:46.510
Hey, there,

20:46.806 --> 20:48.812
I'm Rafael. what can I do for you?

20:48.979 --> 20:51.806
She's getting sent back
to an abusive foster home,

20:51.818 --> 20:53.416
her social worker won't
do anything about it,

20:53.428 --> 20:54.821
so we need to talk to someone who can

20:55.105 --> 20:57.053
help get her a new placement or whatever.

20:57.434 --> 20:57.943
OK.

20:58.511 --> 20:59.529
I'm really sorry to hear at.

20:59.767 --> 21:01.688
Um, first, we'll have to get you a CASA...

21:03.341 --> 21:05.440
That is a Court Appointed Special Advocate.

21:05.812 --> 21:06.586
Here you go.

21:06.672 --> 21:07.679
But it's gonna be a few weeks

21:07.694 --> 21:09.265
- before we can...
- No, we don't have weeks.

21:09.277 --> 21:10.187
Let's just go.

21:10.214 --> 21:11.477
No, look, I'm sorry,

21:11.504 --> 21:12.601
but it's really important

21:12.620 --> 21:14.681
- that we get you on a waitlist. If we...
- A waitlist?

21:14.977 --> 21:17.470
All we're ever freaking doing is waiting.

21:17.657 --> 21:20.479
How long we gotta wait for someone
who's actually going to listen to us?

21:20.541 --> 21:21.110
Huh?

21:21.230 --> 21:23.049
Someone that's actually help us.

21:23.119 --> 21:24.324
How long's that gonna be?

21:24.355 --> 21:25.534
Until we're 18?

21:26.377 --> 21:27.128
I'm sorry,

21:28.015 --> 21:28.959
I really am.

21:29.605 --> 21:33.088
In the meantime, we could set up an
appointment with a counselor, try to...

21:33.127 --> 21:36.187
Kiara is in a house with drug dealers.

21:36.261 --> 21:38.376
OK, you think a little
therapy is gonna help that?

21:38.656 --> 21:40.728
The main reason we need
the therapy is because

21:40.743 --> 21:43.878
we keep getting put in these screwed
up situations in the first place!

21:46.311 --> 21:48.617
This is pointless, let's
go, this is a waste of time.

21:53.023 --> 21:54.765
I don't understand, we
already gave our statements.

21:54.773 --> 21:57.033
Well, there were some
inconsistencies, for instance,

21:57.044 --> 21:59.144
you said that you didn't know the intruder,

21:59.179 --> 22:00.451
but he seems to know you.

22:00.537 --> 22:02.753
- He's more of an acquaintance.
- Where does he live?

22:03.274 --> 22:06.241
- In the neighborhood, I think.
- Actually, he lives in Oceanside.

22:06.327 --> 22:08.341
Maybe he works around here, I don't know.

22:08.368 --> 22:09.227
He's unemployed.

22:09.865 --> 22:12.194
Well, like I told you, we barely know him.

22:12.260 --> 22:14.118
Then why'd you let him in your house?

22:14.686 --> 22:16.106
Couldn't you see he was
tweaked out of his mind?

22:16.122 --> 22:18.630
- Not at first. He seemed fine...
- We didn't let him in.

22:18.750 --> 22:21.161
Like I said in my
statement, he forced his way.

22:21.200 --> 22:23.553
So did you let him in or
you didn't? He says yeah.

22:23.588 --> 22:24.437
He's a tweaker,

22:24.557 --> 22:26.015
who can believe anything he says, right?

22:26.043 --> 22:27.411
No, that he was a tweaker.

22:27.531 --> 22:29.623
You know where he's getting
his drugs? Are you selling him?

22:29.635 --> 22:30.220
You know what,

22:30.758 --> 22:32.460
if you want to talk more, get a warrant.

22:32.674 --> 22:34.709
If you wanna do this the
hard way, maybe we will.

22:34.731 --> 22:36.239
- But let me tell you one thing...
- Stef...

22:36.519 --> 22:38.448
You let one of those foster kids get hurt,

22:38.448 --> 22:41.067
at all, in any way, you
let them come to any harm,

22:41.098 --> 22:42.900
and I will dedicate my
life to ruining yours.

22:42.950 --> 22:43.992
- Is that a threat?
- No.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.117
- No threats.
- I know my rights.

22:45.155 --> 22:46.383
- Thank you for your time.
- I'm sure you do.

22:46.423 --> 22:48.054
All that time spent in the prison library?

22:48.100 --> 22:50.442
I may not be a lawyer,
but I do know my rights.

22:52.713 --> 22:53.995
What the hell is wrong with people?

22:54.785 --> 22:55.899
What the hell is wrong with you?

22:56.453 --> 22:58.418
You were totally over the
line in there, and you know it.

22:59.115 --> 23:01.193
I know this is frustrating as all get out,

23:01.782 --> 23:04.140
and I know you hate feeling
like there's nothing you can do,

23:04.143 --> 23:05.445
feeling powerless. But you can't

23:05.919 --> 23:07.776
go getting yourself in trouble, Stef.

23:08.504 --> 23:10.128
You want IA on your ass again?

23:15.962 --> 23:16.951
OK, thank you.

23:18.523 --> 23:18.946
Oh,

23:19.232 --> 23:20.616
have you talked to Timothy yet?

23:21.634 --> 23:24.841
Not yet, I just, uh, I
haven't had a chance today.

23:24.961 --> 23:27.087
OK, let me know how it goes.

23:27.264 --> 23:27.865
Yeah.

23:29.271 --> 23:30.390
Oh, you know,

23:30.626 --> 23:31.954
I've been meaning to tell you,

23:31.970 --> 23:33.625
Mariana stopped by my office today.

23:33.908 --> 23:35.239
- She did? Why?
- Well,

23:35.300 --> 23:38.341
she asked me not to announce
her during the assembly tomorrow,

23:38.376 --> 23:40.475
said she didn't want all the attention.

23:41.164 --> 23:43.232
Mariana? My Mariana?

23:43.352 --> 23:44.943
Said she didn't want attention?

23:45.028 --> 23:47.964
That girl used to make the whole family
clap every time she put on her shoes.

23:48.450 --> 23:49.814
What is that about?

24:10.344 --> 24:11.441
You ever wonder

24:11.822 --> 24:13.229
what would've happened if I hadn't

24:13.268 --> 24:15.077
called Stef and Lena
when we were on the roof?

24:21.045 --> 24:23.242
I only came back because
of you, you know that.

24:24.036 --> 24:25.264
That's not true.

24:25.346 --> 24:26.661
It is true. It's...

24:27.442 --> 24:28.920
more true that it should be.

24:29.418 --> 24:30.297
It's kinda pathetic.

24:31.164 --> 24:32.778
It's not pathetic.

24:36.098 --> 24:38.651
So are you going to go back to Indiana?

24:38.771 --> 24:40.174
With your mom?

24:40.209 --> 24:43.375
I'm thinking about it. I don't know.

24:43.702 --> 24:46.040
Maybe this time I'll just drive.

24:46.625 --> 24:49.205
Maybe I'll hang out in New
Mexico for a little while,

24:49.235 --> 24:50.663
see if I can get abducted by aliens.

24:52.788 --> 24:55.132
You know, I don't think that
would be as fun as you think.

24:55.142 --> 24:56.581
How would you know?

24:57.033 --> 25:00.230
Oh, my whole life is kinda
like being abducted by aliens.

25:00.901 --> 25:01.873
Still?

25:03.064 --> 25:05.820
Well, judge is talking about
making me go and live with Robert.

25:07.055 --> 25:09.252
Seriously? He's basically like a stranger.

25:10.038 --> 25:11.711
It wouldn't be the first time.

25:17.485 --> 25:18.671
So come with me.

25:54.032 --> 25:57.425
Oh, uh, sorry.

25:58.922 --> 26:01.819
So Monty told me you came to see her today?

26:01.834 --> 26:03.569
To talk about the assembly tomorrow?

26:04.279 --> 26:06.203
Oh yeah, I was just,

26:06.323 --> 26:07.914
offering to help out, if

26:07.953 --> 26:09.692
you know, if she needed anything.

26:10.145 --> 26:12.011
Really? Because that's
not quite what she...

26:16.634 --> 26:18.710
I guess I misunderstood.

26:21.300 --> 26:22.680
Are you done with your homework?

26:23.103 --> 26:24.605
Just getting to it.

26:24.961 --> 26:26.181
Don't forget your math.

26:38.508 --> 26:41.896
So, do I have to talk during this
meeting? Or can I just listen?

26:42.016 --> 26:42.853
Up to you.

26:43.184 --> 26:45.065
Come on, what should I expect?

26:45.940 --> 26:48.764
To sit in a room with a
bunch of kids talk about

26:48.784 --> 26:50.757
having drunk parents, OK?

26:54.913 --> 26:57.761
Look, I only went once.

26:57.922 --> 27:01.257
And I totally zoned out. I usually end up

27:01.377 --> 27:03.809
getting pizza or something
around the corner.

27:04.329 --> 27:05.870
- Don't tell Moms.
- Why the hell did you wait

27:05.885 --> 27:06.916
so long to tell me that?

27:06.974 --> 27:08.826
Screw Alateen, let's go!

27:18.294 --> 27:22.173
So you wanna help out at the assembly, huh?

27:22.897 --> 27:26.251
I just, Mat was so proud of his math score,

27:26.266 --> 27:28.424
and I beat him by like
six points, and I just...

27:28.439 --> 27:30.388
Just don't wanna seem
smarter than your boyfriend?

27:34.175 --> 27:35.375
Oh, honey,

27:36.211 --> 27:40.135
if he can't handle the math
genius and the pink nails, well,

27:40.742 --> 27:42.317
then, he doesn't deserve you.

27:43.717 --> 27:45.715
Don't play small, my love.

27:46.284 --> 27:48.214
Not for him, not for anybody.

27:49.817 --> 27:51.809
You're already really short.

27:59.291 --> 28:01.838
This girl can't go more than
five minutes without texting me.

28:01.882 --> 28:05.055
She's like a Registered Text Offender.

28:05.828 --> 28:08.715
Why do you put up with it? If you
don't like her, then just end it.

28:08.835 --> 28:10.611
I like her, I guess.

28:10.898 --> 28:12.181
She's really into me.

28:14.422 --> 28:15.963
But it's not as simple as that.

28:16.809 --> 28:18.894
- Why not?
- You can't tell moms.

28:19.677 --> 28:22.598
You know what? I'm actually
trying to go on tour, anyway,

28:22.608 --> 28:24.542
it's probably best I don't
know anything about...

28:24.551 --> 28:26.044
Oh, what?

28:26.219 --> 28:28.785
Please tell me that's not real.

28:28.843 --> 28:30.783
I wish.

28:31.186 --> 28:32.445
What were you thinking, dude?

28:32.469 --> 28:34.516
I don't need you to
tell me I'm an idiot, OK?

28:34.550 --> 28:35.372
I already know.

28:35.449 --> 28:36.873
Yeah, it was stupid,

28:36.898 --> 28:39.114
and if Moms find out that, you are dead,

28:39.234 --> 28:40.815
completely dead.

28:46.759 --> 28:47.833
Well, I, uh...

28:48.427 --> 28:51.031
I have actually done worse. Much worse.

28:51.085 --> 28:52.835
- Like what?
- Uh...

28:52.893 --> 28:54.837
Come on, I just told you.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.467
It doesn't matter. Let's just say

28:57.710 --> 28:59.805
I wish that I just had a tattoo.

29:06.440 --> 29:09.629
You know, I think we could probably
still catch most of that meeting

29:09.749 --> 29:10.771
if we hurry.

29:20.593 --> 29:21.867
What's going on?

29:22.212 --> 29:25.517
I just found out I have to
see Robert in a few days.

29:25.692 --> 29:27.000
Oh, really?

29:27.661 --> 29:29.576
Yeah. I just thought that

29:29.975 --> 29:32.216
after the whole Sophia
thing that maybe they'd,

29:32.881 --> 29:34.306
call it off or something.

29:34.476 --> 29:36.202
She really tried to kill herself?

29:37.665 --> 29:40.606
Why? She think Heaven's gonna
be any nicer than that house?

29:41.359 --> 29:43.955
- Yeah...
- Sorry. But for real.

29:44.139 --> 29:45.525
Why would she do that?

29:46.594 --> 29:48.656
I think she...

29:52.724 --> 29:54.775
Sometimes it just gets
to be too much, you know?

29:56.214 --> 29:58.683
Oh, I know.

30:00.735 --> 30:02.691
'Course you do.

30:04.438 --> 30:06.308
I'm gonna be all right, Callie.

30:06.428 --> 30:09.078
Even if they send me go back to that place,

30:09.488 --> 30:11.113
I'm gonna be all right.

30:18.412 --> 30:20.752
_

30:29.532 --> 30:32.008
_

30:35.737 --> 30:37.150
And I know they're dealing drugs,

30:37.188 --> 30:39.869
it's the most obvious thing in
the world, but they're smart.

30:39.900 --> 30:42.459
We can't catch 'em. And now
Kiara's gotta go back there.

30:42.505 --> 30:44.677
What happens when the
next tweaker goes crazy?

30:44.797 --> 30:46.804
What if they have a gun?

30:47.943 --> 30:52.014
I hate the system sometimes.

30:52.310 --> 30:54.179
I mean, they'll basically start

30:54.299 --> 30:56.283
shipping the kids out as soon

30:56.298 --> 30:58.577
as you can prove you have an extra room.

31:04.402 --> 31:05.928
What?

31:07.229 --> 31:10.744
Standardized tests are worthless, you
know that. I've even heard you say it.

31:10.751 --> 31:13.200
I don't disagree with you that
they've become too important,

31:13.248 --> 31:14.925
but they're the barometer that people use,

31:14.934 --> 31:16.660
when they're talking
about successful schools.

31:16.694 --> 31:17.715
What people?

31:17.744 --> 31:19.955
The people who decide
who to give grants to.

31:19.975 --> 31:22.469
The people who renew our
charter. Those people.

31:23.261 --> 31:26.056
Timothy, the school is
in a financial crisis.

31:26.066 --> 31:27.528
This is one of the things we have to do

31:27.528 --> 31:28.428
to keep the doors open.

31:28.437 --> 31:29.993
- And if we wanna grow...
- What do you mean, "grow"?

31:30.353 --> 31:32.943
What, does Monty got some
plan to franchise Anchor Beach?

31:33.322 --> 31:35.179
This isn't a fast food restaurant!

31:35.354 --> 31:37.070
Look, I took a pay cut

31:37.133 --> 31:39.748
to come to a charter school so
I could teach the way I want,

31:39.934 --> 31:42.456
in the way I think actually makes
a difference to the students.

31:42.670 --> 31:44.652
I want these kids to be able to think,

31:44.852 --> 31:46.548
I'm not gonna make them sit around all day

31:46.626 --> 31:49.566
- and regurgitate facts.
- I respect that, you know that I do.

31:49.848 --> 31:52.667
But we have to demonstrate
that we're academically on par

31:52.696 --> 31:54.188
with the other schools in the system.

31:54.222 --> 31:56.016
So we're meant to teach to the test now?

31:56.136 --> 31:57.027
Is that it?

31:57.508 --> 31:58.626
And where does it stop?

31:59.151 --> 32:00.887
Are we about to get a list of banned books?

32:00.921 --> 32:01.708
Don't be hyperbolic.

32:01.718 --> 32:03.973
This doesn't sound like you at all, Lena.

32:05.009 --> 32:07.507
I thought you had final say
when it came to academics here.

32:07.716 --> 32:09.155
- I do.
- Really?

32:09.725 --> 32:11.168
'Cause it doesn't seem like that.

32:18.493 --> 32:20.938
They've never missed a payment,
and they've got a year lease,

32:20.958 --> 32:23.617
so I couldn't evict them if I wanted to.

32:23.737 --> 32:26.446
How many people did they say would
be living in the apartment, again?

32:27.000 --> 32:28.166
A husband and wife.

32:28.166 --> 32:30.844
Mmm, so they didn't mention the
three foster kids on the lease?

32:30.864 --> 32:32.074
That sounds like a breech to me.

32:32.113 --> 32:34.135
OK, sure. But I don't really care.

32:34.164 --> 32:36.969
As long as they don't
have a waterbed, I'm cool.

32:38.189 --> 32:41.883
Would you be cool if I told you that your
tenants were under suspicion for selling drugs?

32:42.082 --> 32:44.449
Now we'll be driving by
two or three times a night,

32:44.493 --> 32:48.085
shining spotlights in their windows and the
windows of everyone else in the building.

32:48.205 --> 32:50.083
How will your other
tenants feel about that?

32:50.710 --> 32:53.218
Oh, and, I noticed some code violations.

32:53.238 --> 32:54.215
Yes, yeah.

32:54.234 --> 32:56.436
We're gonna have to send someone
from county down to do an inspection.

32:56.446 --> 32:57.345
I think so.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.601
- Later.
- Later.

33:24.136 --> 33:25.930
- Ninety-eight.
- Huh?

33:27.024 --> 33:28.871
I got a 98. On the math exams.

33:28.906 --> 33:29.999
Wait a sec, you did?

33:31.292 --> 33:32.969
- But why'd you tell me...
- Because

33:33.089 --> 33:36.805
even though I'm really smart,
I can be super super stupid.

33:36.925 --> 33:40.537
I was afraid you'd be, I
dunno, you'd be threatened if...

33:40.657 --> 33:43.026
If I knew you kicked my ass in math.

33:43.560 --> 33:45.262
Wow,

33:45.700 --> 33:47.931
- you don't really think much of me, huh?
- No,

33:48.218 --> 33:49.719
I think you're awesome.

33:50.351 --> 33:52.305
It's me I wonder about sometimes.

33:58.750 --> 34:01.681
Come on, nerd, walk me to band practice.

34:06.225 --> 34:08.641
So how'd it go? With Timothy?

34:09.103 --> 34:10.030
Not great.

34:10.496 --> 34:12.087
Really? Why not?

34:20.010 --> 34:21.391
I thought you said I had, autonomy,

34:21.425 --> 34:22.742
when it comes to academics here.

34:22.862 --> 34:24.886
- You do.
- Are you sure about that?

34:24.905 --> 34:26.621
Because I don't want
to completely undermine

34:26.639 --> 34:28.347
the really great work
our teachers are doing,

34:28.360 --> 34:29.917
just to get some test scores up.

34:30.223 --> 34:33.545
Lena, I'm not trying to impose on
your authority over the teachers.

34:33.619 --> 34:35.777
I just wanna make sure we
get our charter renewed.

34:35.995 --> 34:38.635
And that we qualify for as many
funding streams as possible.

34:40.023 --> 34:40.764
OK.

34:43.592 --> 34:44.455
Sorry, I...

34:45.149 --> 34:47.237
And I know that we have
to figure out a way to

34:47.272 --> 34:48.368
work the system,

34:48.761 --> 34:49.453
I get that.

34:49.643 --> 34:52.828
When I said we're a team, Lena, I meant it.

34:53.324 --> 34:55.962
I think you're an extraordinary educator.

34:56.121 --> 34:57.980
I'm learning so much from you.

34:59.372 --> 35:00.197
Thank you.

35:00.834 --> 35:02.736
I respect you, too, I do. I...

35:03.133 --> 35:05.443
I think I'm a little gun shy,

35:05.474 --> 35:06.944
after our last principal.

35:09.737 --> 35:10.499
So

35:10.802 --> 35:13.170
how did you leave things with Timothy?

35:13.462 --> 35:17.623
Well, he said he's going to teach the
way he wants to teach and that's that.

35:18.933 --> 35:21.169
Well, he's gonna have to give a little bit.

35:21.289 --> 35:23.090
Do you think he's at all open to that?

35:24.435 --> 35:25.248
I'm not sure.

35:25.640 --> 35:27.475
Well, look, if he's not willing
to work with the administration,

35:27.479 --> 35:29.290
and teach the prescribed curriculum...

35:30.593 --> 35:31.697
then we'll fire him.

35:36.939 --> 35:38.549
Hey, Callie, Kiara?

35:40.171 --> 35:41.497
Anybody home?

35:42.999 --> 35:44.969
Kiara, Callie, you in there?

35:45.288 --> 35:46.867
Hello, ladies.

36:11.714 --> 36:12.877
You pack light.

36:20.782 --> 36:21.560
Here.

36:22.294 --> 36:23.630
No, that's... that's yours.

36:24.127 --> 36:24.967
It was a gift.

36:26.051 --> 36:28.626
I think you need it more than I do.

36:29.193 --> 36:31.850
I mean, if you're gonna go, gallivanting
around the country, you're gonna

36:31.900 --> 36:34.284
need something to remind
you of home, right?

36:37.317 --> 36:38.309
You're staying.

36:40.821 --> 36:41.910
You should, too.

36:43.189 --> 36:45.048
But not for me. You should stay for you.

36:48.765 --> 36:50.289
I know you didn't come back for me, Wyatt.

36:50.308 --> 36:51.891
You came back to finish school. So do it.

36:52.190 --> 36:53.112
Finish it.

36:54.691 --> 36:55.746
What about you? You gonna

36:55.800 --> 36:56.784
finish what you started?

36:59.316 --> 37:02.749
You know, you really only have two choices.
Either you give up or you keep trying.

37:05.642 --> 37:06.388
Well,

37:08.064 --> 37:11.173
if there's one thing I know about you,
you're not really the giving up kind.

37:11.809 --> 37:13.461
Are you?

37:57.149 --> 37:58.651
How's Callie?

37:59.000 --> 38:02.057
She's sad... and worried.

38:02.177 --> 38:05.019
I don't know how much more
disappointment she can take

38:05.139 --> 38:07.620
before she runs... again.

38:07.740 --> 38:10.571
Well, at least those other kids don't have
to go back to that home. That's a big win.

38:10.586 --> 38:12.348
On a technicality.

38:12.865 --> 38:17.065
Meanwhile her friend is
out on the street tonight.

38:17.710 --> 38:19.495
Doing God knows what to survive.

38:19.615 --> 38:20.786
You think they'll find her?

38:20.906 --> 38:23.315
Well, hopefully she'll

38:23.665 --> 38:27.348
get arrested for some minor crime
before something worse happens to her.

38:27.468 --> 38:29.581
I'm really sorry, honey.

38:31.973 --> 38:34.366
What would you think about...

38:35.133 --> 38:37.700
about Mike and I partnering again?

38:39.925 --> 38:41.208
Really?

38:41.390 --> 38:44.337
He drives me crazy,
because he knows me so well.

38:44.457 --> 38:46.871
But in a partner, you
know that's a good thing.

38:47.582 --> 38:49.028
- I was talking with Mike and...
- Wait,

38:49.089 --> 38:50.936
you already talked to Mike about this?

38:50.954 --> 38:53.634
No. I mean, yes, we discussed it, but,

38:53.754 --> 38:54.716
you know,

38:54.946 --> 38:56.040
pending your approval.

38:56.076 --> 38:58.914
I was very clear that it
was pending your approval.

38:59.728 --> 39:01.398
Can I please think about this?

39:01.433 --> 39:05.057
Of course. I'm not even sure, so...

39:09.766 --> 39:12.554
- In other news...
- Yes, please.

39:12.674 --> 39:14.906
I have a small win for you.

39:14.924 --> 39:16.291
Oh, for me?

39:16.327 --> 39:18.259
Yes, I was talking to Monty.

39:18.320 --> 39:19.371
She's so swell.

39:19.402 --> 39:21.613
And she convinced me that

39:21.916 --> 39:24.633
sending Brandon on tour
could be really good,

39:25.028 --> 39:26.255
even for college.

39:26.375 --> 39:28.904
That it could set him apart
from the other applicants.

39:29.761 --> 39:32.119
So, I think we should let him go.

39:33.054 --> 39:35.181
So she said what I said but

39:35.199 --> 39:37.138
because she said it, it's right?

39:37.623 --> 39:40.212
- Yes, exactly.
- Well, that's really funny,

39:40.230 --> 39:43.578
because I was talking with Mike and he
convinced me that I was crazy, so there you go.

39:43.698 --> 39:45.194
Of course.

39:57.674 --> 40:01.484
Don't worry, I'm not going to
go off on you again or anything.

40:02.365 --> 40:04.425
I wouldn't blame you if you did.

40:06.121 --> 40:07.688
I need your help with something.

40:08.411 --> 40:09.845
OK.

40:11.079 --> 40:12.410
I wanna volunteer.

40:13.455 --> 40:16.644
I have to do some kinda, independent study

40:16.687 --> 40:19.573
for school so I can graduate
and I wanna do it here.

40:20.096 --> 40:22.076
I wanna help the kids who need it.

40:24.185 --> 40:25.504
Where's your friend?

40:26.657 --> 40:28.092
She ran away.

40:32.641 --> 40:35.537
I think we can work something out.

40:35.905 --> 40:38.375
You're a fighter.

40:38.707 --> 40:41.261
We could always use a
good fighter around here.

40:44.980 --> 40:48.475
All righty. Well, if you're going to be
volunteering, here, I might as well show you around.

40:48.595 --> 40:50.833
- OK.
- So, here we go.
