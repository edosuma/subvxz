WEBVTT

00:01.902 --> 00:03.137
Hello, everyone! I'm back!

00:03.171 --> 00:05.039
This is my boyfriend Joel.

00:05.073 --> 00:06.107
Welcome to
our little town, Joel.

00:06.140 --> 00:08.276
I came all this way to
tell you that I love you.

00:08.309 --> 00:10.511
What you said to me before
I left, it meant something.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
But then it's like
real life took over.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.282
Zoe Hart does not get to
have a real boyfriend.

00:14.315 --> 00:15.549
She does not get to
break your heart

00:15.583 --> 00:17.085
and then waltz off
into the sunset.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.187
I sublet the carriage house
to my cousin Lynly.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.288
ZOE:
 That's Little Lynly?

00:20.321 --> 00:22.090
Little Lynly is nursing
a broken heart.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.125
Now, if you so much
as flirt with her,

00:24.158 --> 00:25.559
I will remove your arms.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.528
Are you planning on leaving
any time soon?

00:27.561 --> 00:28.529
You're just like my parents.

00:28.562 --> 00:31.132
What is wrong with me?
Why does everyone hate me?

00:31.165 --> 00:32.100
You win the break-up contest.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.801
I told Zoe Hart that

00:33.834 --> 00:35.569
you have an amazing
new girlfriend: me.

00:37.505 --> 00:39.273
Looks like we'll be living
happily ever after.

00:39.307 --> 00:40.408
(chuckles)

00:54.255 --> 00:55.356
Good morning?

00:55.389 --> 00:58.559
There was a moment there
when I had the fans oscillating

00:58.592 --> 00:59.460
in the perfect
contrapuntal motion,

00:59.493 --> 01:02.563
and there was just
the inkling of a breeze

01:02.596 --> 01:04.397
coming through
the mosquito screens,

01:04.432 --> 01:05.633
when I didn't feel like

01:05.666 --> 01:07.568
I was gonna
spontaneously combust.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.603
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay here?

01:11.872 --> 01:13.441
Of course.

01:13.474 --> 01:14.842
Really?

01:14.875 --> 01:17.545
Because that's the smile you use
around my mother.

01:17.578 --> 01:18.879
Okay.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.848
(slams ice cube bag)

01:20.881 --> 01:22.450
Zoe, I love you.

01:22.483 --> 01:24.352
I want to be with you.

01:24.385 --> 01:28.389
And last night, the idea of
moving here seemed so romantic.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.358
But now, in the...

01:30.391 --> 01:32.360
not-at-all-cold
light of day,

01:32.393 --> 01:33.427
it feels, um...

01:33.461 --> 01:35.229
Like you're
sweating lava?

01:36.497 --> 01:37.898
Yes, it's an adjustment.

01:37.931 --> 01:38.866
Look, it all is, you know?

01:38.899 --> 01:41.269
I mean, it's like,
I've lived on the same block

01:41.302 --> 01:42.136
for the last ten years.

01:42.170 --> 01:45.373
You know, I had...
I had my coffee place,

01:45.406 --> 01:46.874
I had my sushi place.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.609
The guy at the newsstand
would talk to me

01:48.642 --> 01:50.178
every morning
about the Knicks,

01:50.211 --> 01:52.380
as if I knew about sports;
it was awesome.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.349
Now I have a book due.

01:55.383 --> 01:57.385
I don't even know
if I can write here.

01:57.418 --> 01:58.486
I get it.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.388
You're totally
at sea.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.390
I wish.
It'd be cooler at sea.

02:02.423 --> 02:05.359
Joel, I felt the
exact same way

02:05.393 --> 02:06.894
when I moved here.

02:06.927 --> 02:10.198
But you have something
that I didn't: me!

02:10.231 --> 02:13.201
I will show you
the ins, the outs,

02:13.234 --> 02:16.304
the food, the drink,
the places where alligators

02:16.337 --> 02:18.606
might possibly eat
your computer.

02:18.639 --> 02:22.243
I promise, you're gonna
fall in love with BlueBell.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.382
(sighs)

02:31.585 --> 02:33.321
(sheets rustling)

02:33.354 --> 02:34.722
(man belches)

02:36.357 --> 02:39.493
I am irresistible.

02:39.527 --> 02:40.528
No, you are disgusting.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.730
Well, you don't think
I'm disgusting

02:42.763 --> 02:44.432
when I'm doing that thing
you like.

02:44.465 --> 02:45.299
You know,

02:45.333 --> 02:47.601
the one with the...
Stop! Go! Get out!

02:47.635 --> 02:49.970
See you here at noon?

02:50.003 --> 02:50.971
No!

02:51.004 --> 02:52.740
Okay. 11:30.

02:58.379 --> 03:00.381
(birds chirping)

03:04.718 --> 03:06.554
(clears throat)
Hey...

03:06.587 --> 03:10.391
person...
who I'm horrified to say

03:10.424 --> 03:11.659
I don't know the name of.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.562
Just call me
Chick from Last Night.

03:14.595 --> 03:15.563
Okay.

03:15.596 --> 03:18.966
Well, uh, Chick,
um, thank you

03:18.999 --> 03:20.234
for, you know.

03:20.268 --> 03:21.435
Uh, it was great.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.337
It was... it was
really, really great.

03:23.371 --> 03:25.239
But you've got
places to go.

03:25.273 --> 03:26.206
And so do I.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.276
Been through
the morning-after drill before.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.978
Okay. Uh, well,
then feel free to shower.

03:31.011 --> 03:32.580
And...

03:32.613 --> 03:34.315
I made you some eggs.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.586
No one's ever made me eggs.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.588
It's not that hard;
you just crack 'em,

03:40.621 --> 03:42.390
and you mix 'em up,
and then...

03:42.423 --> 03:44.992
Well, you have
a great day.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.794
It's a pleasure to meet you.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.762
Good-bye.

03:54.502 --> 03:55.503
DASH:
 Well, Blawkers,

03:55.536 --> 03:58.672
it's official, Lemon-ade lives!

03:58.706 --> 04:00.608
So tell me,

04:00.641 --> 04:02.776
when did you two first feel
that first spark?

04:02.810 --> 04:06.314
Well, who could forget?

04:06.347 --> 04:08.316
Uh, it happened this past...

04:08.349 --> 04:09.383
Saturday.
...Summer.

04:10.418 --> 04:11.619
Summer.
Summer.
She's always right.

04:11.652 --> 04:12.620
(chuckles):
Oh.

04:12.653 --> 04:13.787
Well, Wade, did you ever

04:13.821 --> 04:15.489
imagine that
you'd settle down

04:15.523 --> 04:17.425
with someone
like Lemon Breeland here?

04:17.458 --> 04:18.759
(laughs)
Never!

04:18.791 --> 04:20.361
(foot stamps)
(clears throat)

04:20.394 --> 04:22.496
It's just, I-I never thought
she'd be interested

04:22.530 --> 04:23.631
in someone like me.

04:23.664 --> 04:24.832
Oh.
(chuckles):
Oh.

04:24.865 --> 04:25.766
And, Lemon,

04:25.799 --> 04:26.767
what is it, pray tell,

04:26.800 --> 04:27.835
about Wade Kinsella

04:27.868 --> 04:29.770
that you're attracted to?

04:29.803 --> 04:32.340
Well...

04:32.373 --> 04:34.508
It must be
my willingness to go along

04:34.542 --> 04:36.444
with all her crazy ideas.

04:36.477 --> 04:37.511
Oh.

04:37.545 --> 04:38.846
(silverware tapping glass)

04:38.879 --> 04:41.382
It means
you're supposed to kiss.

04:41.415 --> 04:44.385
At weddings, not at
our place of business.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.487
This is not a bordello.
(chuckles)

04:46.520 --> 04:47.521
WANDA:
Come on!

04:47.555 --> 04:48.856
It's an added attraction.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.057
Kiss!

04:50.090 --> 04:51.559
Kiss!
Kiss!

04:51.592 --> 04:53.727
ALL (chanting):
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

04:53.761 --> 04:55.563
(chanting continues)

04:55.596 --> 04:56.664
Come on, kiss.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.532
(applause)

04:58.566 --> 05:01.835
(quietly):
This is a disaster.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.772
I only lied because
I thought that Zoe was leaving.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.475
You are the one who outed us
to the whole town.

05:07.508 --> 05:10.344
I didn't plan on anyone thinking
that I would actually date you.

05:10.378 --> 05:11.812
I have a reputation to protect.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.547
Oh, says the girl
who's screwing Meatball.

05:13.581 --> 05:14.715
(gasps)

05:14.748 --> 05:16.784
That is my own
private shame.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.386
I can't have
a public one, too.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.587
You know how hard
I've been working

05:19.620 --> 05:20.888
to find the right sort of man.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.123
Let's just end this now.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.692
We cannot end this now!

05:24.725 --> 05:25.859
Everybody would be onto us.

05:25.893 --> 05:27.828
We have to be covert
and deliberate.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.497
Well, let me just

05:29.530 --> 05:31.499
grab this pencil,
and I will take notes

05:31.532 --> 05:33.100
on how you dissolve
a fake relationship.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.201
Well, fine.

05:34.234 --> 05:37.505
Step one: we announce
that we're having problems.

05:37.538 --> 05:38.606
Step two:

05:38.639 --> 05:40.107
we stage a fight, and we end it.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.609
And step three:

05:41.642 --> 05:42.843
we all just move on
with our lives,

05:42.876 --> 05:44.712
and we hope
everybody here

05:44.745 --> 05:46.480
has amnesia.
(silverware tapping glass)

05:46.514 --> 05:48.115
ALL (chanting):
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

05:48.148 --> 05:50.751
(chanting continues)

05:50.784 --> 05:53.153
Step four:
you get some mouthwash.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.856
(applause)

05:55.889 --> 05:57.591
DASH:
And they kissed.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.860
(car horn honks)

05:59.893 --> 06:02.129
(seagulls calling)

06:02.162 --> 06:04.465
(birds singing)

06:10.638 --> 06:11.939
Once Lemon became a
roadhouse proprietress,

06:11.972 --> 06:13.874
it was only a matter of time

06:13.907 --> 06:16.444
until she started
dating the help.

06:16.477 --> 06:17.678
What's that
supposed to mean?

06:18.946 --> 06:20.748
Who's Lemon dating?

06:20.781 --> 06:21.782
Wade Kinsella.

06:22.783 --> 06:25.152
Also, please don't ever
address us ever again.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.555
(chuckles):
Wade Kinsella?

06:27.588 --> 06:29.890
She would never
date Wade Kinsella.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.192
Oh, they outed themselves
to the whole town last night.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.528
Lemon's no
spring chicken,

06:34.562 --> 06:37.465
but I didn't expect her
to just give up.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.835
The Butter Stick
is where you get

06:41.869 --> 06:43.571
your basic pastries
and your coffee.

06:43.604 --> 06:44.672
(door slams)
Oh.

06:44.705 --> 06:45.906
How are the bagels?

06:45.939 --> 06:47.675
Here, they call them
English muffins.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.878
Tom, hey! This is my boyfriend.
Joel Stephens.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.513
(chuckles)

06:52.546 --> 06:54.915
The Cicada's Lament
is my favorite book ever!

06:54.948 --> 06:57.685
I bought it online because I
thought it was about bugs.

06:57.718 --> 06:59.487
And then I was reading it,
and I was like,

06:59.520 --> 07:00.488
"This isn't about bugs."

07:00.521 --> 07:01.589
And then I was like,

07:01.622 --> 07:03.691
"This is about everything."

07:03.724 --> 07:05.593
I have no less than
45 questions

07:05.626 --> 07:07.961
that I have been dying to
ask you, Mr. Stephens.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.797
Oh, yeah, well, sure.

07:09.830 --> 07:10.931
And I'm Joel.

07:10.964 --> 07:11.932
Ah!

07:11.965 --> 07:13.667
I'll get us some coffee.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.769
Ooh!

07:16.770 --> 07:17.771
Big Z!

07:17.805 --> 07:20.674
(chuckles) I'm happy to be
running into you again.

07:20.708 --> 07:21.909
What's up?

07:21.942 --> 07:24.945
Oh, just trying to get Joel
to fall in love with BlueBell.

07:24.978 --> 07:27.548
That, my friend, is ironic.

07:27.581 --> 07:28.949
Like me,
he's a New Yorker.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.951
He needs to connect
with the people.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.720
You know, the really cool,
awesome people,

07:32.753 --> 07:36.223
like, my very, very,
very best friend.

07:36.256 --> 07:37.558
Say no more.

07:37.591 --> 07:38.792
Dinner at the mayor's
plantation tonight.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.961
AB and I will roll out
the red carpet.

07:40.994 --> 07:41.962
You're the best.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.565
Oh, but you may want
to take him

07:44.598 --> 07:45.833
to the Rammer Jammer
for breakfast.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.035
Tom's got that look
he gets when he's taught

07:48.068 --> 07:49.703
his hamster a new trick.

07:49.737 --> 07:50.971
No, I'm not taking him
to the Rammer Jammer.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.005
Not because of Wade.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.240
Not because of Wade.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.742
Because of
Wade and Lemon.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.744
Totally different,
totally disturbing,

07:56.777 --> 07:58.011
and possibly
against nature.

07:58.045 --> 08:00.013
Yeah, I admit,
it's freaking my goose.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.716
No one likes to see their ex
with someone else.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.752
But are you sure
that's all it is?

08:04.785 --> 08:06.554
Yes, that's all.

08:06.587 --> 08:07.855
Okay.

08:07.888 --> 08:08.989
Get over it.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.858
Otherwise, you're gonna
run out of places

08:10.891 --> 08:12.259
to eat real quick.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.894
Thank you.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.797
Hey, hon, c-can you
get me a croissant?

08:16.830 --> 08:18.566
Oh, here, they call them
English muffins.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.033
Come on. I'm gonna take you
somewhere else.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.670
Oh. Should I come?

08:22.703 --> 08:24.638
No, Tom.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.540
Oh, okay.

08:26.574 --> 08:27.875
MEATBALL:
 So, the whole time

08:27.908 --> 08:29.009
we were getting down...

08:29.042 --> 08:31.545
Shh!
...you and Wade?

08:31.579 --> 08:33.080
Listen, it's-it's
complicated.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.582
Wade is my best friend!

08:34.615 --> 08:35.849
You turned me into a guy

08:35.883 --> 08:37.751
that sleeps with
his best friend's girl!

08:37.784 --> 08:39.052
Okay, listen,
I-I will make it up

08:39.086 --> 08:40.888
to you later, all right?
Now just go.

08:40.921 --> 08:41.822
No!

08:42.722 --> 08:44.291
Until you and Wade are through,

08:44.324 --> 08:46.627
this Meatball is closed
for business.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.028
(chuckles)

08:48.061 --> 08:49.296
You're not serious.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.665
Oh, I am very serious.

08:53.634 --> 08:56.136
Anyway, I thought
that's what you wanted.

08:59.707 --> 09:00.908
You know what?

09:00.941 --> 09:02.643
You're absolutely right.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.116
(whistling)

09:11.051 --> 09:12.352
You're still here.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.253
Sorry if it's weird,

09:13.286 --> 09:15.322
but I didn't know
how to contact you,

09:15.355 --> 09:18.025
and I wanted to offer
to make you dinner later.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.828
You know, to repay you
for the eggs.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.930
You know what?
That's-that's not necessary.

09:22.963 --> 09:25.032
Huge relief,
'cause I don't cook.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.133
We could go out.

09:26.166 --> 09:29.637
Uh... you know, listen, um,

09:29.670 --> 09:31.705
I hope I haven't given you
the wrong idea here,

09:31.739 --> 09:34.642
but since we didn't even
exchange names,

09:34.675 --> 09:37.377
I thought that this was
kind of a one-time...

09:37.410 --> 09:38.946
Oh, yeah, totally!

09:38.979 --> 09:40.948
I've got to go.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.884
And I'll see you around.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.720
Yeah.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.388
The name
Rammer Jammer comes from

09:48.421 --> 09:50.157
the University of Alabama's
fight song,

09:50.190 --> 09:51.825
not something
vaguely sexual,

09:51.859 --> 09:53.761
which is what I thought
for the first year.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.095
Thanks.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.866
Doc, Mr. Doc.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.734
What can I, uh, get for y'all?

10:00.768 --> 10:02.169
Pancakes for two.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.737
Actually, uh,
when in Alabama.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.372
I will have the grits.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.707
Grits. Sure?

10:06.740 --> 10:08.041
It's kind of an acquired taste.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.376
Grits don't scare me.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.144
As long as they're
not prepared with

10:11.178 --> 10:12.112
or near peanuts,

10:12.145 --> 10:14.381
peanut oil,
mushrooms or cumin.

10:14.414 --> 10:15.983
I've got allergies.

10:17.084 --> 10:18.886
Hmm. Hold the cumin.

10:18.919 --> 10:19.920
Gotcha.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.924
I can't believe there are
actually guys like that.

10:23.957 --> 10:24.792
Did you see his guns?

10:24.825 --> 10:27.695
I bet he got them
doing something rugged

10:27.728 --> 10:29.396
like chopping down trees
or something...

10:29.429 --> 10:30.798
Does he chop down trees?

10:30.831 --> 10:33.000
Funny thing:

10:33.033 --> 10:35.869
Wade and I sort of dated.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.404
No.

10:37.437 --> 10:38.806
Yeah, just for
a few months though

10:38.839 --> 10:39.907
before I left.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.875
But we broke up, and...

10:41.909 --> 10:42.776
him and Lemon dating now,

10:42.810 --> 10:44.745
so I hope
that you're okay with that.

10:44.778 --> 10:45.913
Yeah, you know,

10:45.946 --> 10:48.749
I'm sure that all big-city
doctors that go down South,

10:48.782 --> 10:51.919
uh, go through their
bad-boy-bartender phase.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.153
Yeah, I'm fine.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.855
Good.

10:55.856 --> 10:56.890
Ew! Why?

10:56.924 --> 10:59.126
I thought we were supposed
to be having problems.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.961
Well, it turns out,
me being with you

11:00.994 --> 11:02.696
is the best Meatball
deterrent there is.

11:02.730 --> 11:03.831
I thought sleeping
with Meatball

11:03.864 --> 11:05.165
is the best Meatball
deterrent there is.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.934
You'd think, but there's
this thing that he does...

11:06.967 --> 11:07.735
Ew, gross, stop!

11:07.768 --> 11:09.837
Bleh!
(silverware tapping glass)

11:09.870 --> 11:12.039
Listen, I...
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

11:14.775 --> 11:17.177
Listen, I think if I can
just detox from Meatball

11:17.210 --> 11:19.747
for a few days,
then I can quell my addiction.

11:19.780 --> 11:20.981
Please?

11:22.750 --> 11:24.818
We are definitely
not breaking up.

11:24.852 --> 11:25.853
(chuckles)

11:27.755 --> 11:28.922
(whoops)
Hello!

11:28.956 --> 11:30.758
You okay?

11:30.791 --> 11:33.761
Yeah, I just...
I want to get you some coffee.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.964
The service here leaves
something to be desired.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.144
You know, I just heard
the darnedest thing.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.480
I was out buying
my morning paper,

11:53.513 --> 11:56.817
'cause it's just not a paper
if you read it on a screen.

11:56.850 --> 11:57.818
Right?

11:57.851 --> 11:59.820
And I ran into Sal.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.889
And you know what
Sal had to say?

12:01.922 --> 12:04.792
He was telling me all about
how you and my daughter

12:04.825 --> 12:05.859
were seeing each other!

12:05.893 --> 12:07.094
Now, when did
that happen?!

12:07.127 --> 12:08.829
Uh, summer.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.230
Oh, summer.
Oh, summer, you say.

12:10.263 --> 12:13.901
So-so I've been coming in
here every day, for months,

12:13.934 --> 12:15.202
and you've poured
my coffee,

12:15.235 --> 12:18.005
you, uh, chatted me up
about sports and about cars,

12:18.038 --> 12:19.873
and it never occurred
to you to tell me

12:19.907 --> 12:21.809
that you are dating
my daughter?

12:22.843 --> 12:25.178
I see now that that
m-might bother you.

12:25.212 --> 12:28.515
Oh... I don't expect you
to ask my permission.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.851
But at least I deserve
better than hearing about it

12:30.884 --> 12:31.985
from the fishmonger!

12:32.019 --> 12:33.821
Uh, ah!

12:33.854 --> 12:35.088
Ah!

12:35.122 --> 12:37.791
I got my eye on you.

12:40.060 --> 12:43.130
(sighs):
Man.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.965
I just don't understand.

12:44.998 --> 12:45.833
AnnaBeth and I spent

12:45.866 --> 12:48.869
all summer making
this list of Alabama's

12:48.902 --> 12:50.203
most eligible bachelors for you.

12:50.237 --> 12:51.271
Good-bye, Horace Vanderlinden.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.107
Good-bye,
Charles Ludlow-Strauss.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.943
Good-bye, Carter Covington.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.244
I think I'll miss you
most of all.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.279
Okay, okay, you know,
you can just stop

12:59.312 --> 13:01.815
with the martyr routine,
because we all know

13:01.849 --> 13:03.250
that you copied that list
from Southern Living.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.052
You know who's not
on the list?

13:05.085 --> 13:06.854
Wade Kinsella.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.890
Right. Well, Wade and I
are dating each other

13:09.923 --> 13:11.591
for very complicated
reasons, so...

13:11.624 --> 13:12.960
Abs.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.928
But who knows if Wade
and I will work out?

13:14.962 --> 13:16.930
So I will just
take this list.

13:16.964 --> 13:17.931
Insurance.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.167
I mean, after all, you did go

13:20.200 --> 13:23.270
to all that trouble
of copying it.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.210
Oh, I was thinking steak.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.312
Unless Joel is one
of those New Yorkers

13:32.345 --> 13:34.882
who doesn't eat meat,
and then that would be...

13:34.915 --> 13:37.184
Oh... what is it?

13:37.217 --> 13:39.586
I called, uh, I texted.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.355
Haven't heard
from Lynly all morning.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.892
Yeah, uh, I have
to tell you, um,

13:44.925 --> 13:48.395
yesterday, I asked Lynly
when she was planning to leave,

13:48.428 --> 13:52.099
and she maybe thought it was
because I want her to leave.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.334
And-and-and why would
she think that?

13:54.367 --> 13:56.336
Because I do want her to leave.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.905
I'm sorry, Lavon.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.107
I know she's your cousin,
I know you love her,

14:00.140 --> 14:01.909
but she's driving me nuts!

14:01.942 --> 14:04.644
Well, I-I realize that
Lynly may be emotional

14:04.677 --> 14:06.413
and a-a tad high-maintenance

14:06.446 --> 14:08.115
right now, but...

14:08.148 --> 14:11.018
But I remind you that she's
going through a heartbreak.

14:11.051 --> 14:11.818
I know.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.887
Look, I remind you
that her daddy

14:13.921 --> 14:15.355
taught me how to
throw a football.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.357
I know.
I remind you
that Uncle Shel

14:17.390 --> 14:19.359
and Aunt Beatrice
looked out for me.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.228
And I promised
them that I would

14:21.261 --> 14:22.229
look out for Lynly.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.630
That-that we

14:23.663 --> 14:24.664
would look out for Lynly.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.033
She is a grown woman.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.367
I'm sure she's fine.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.971
Oh, absolutely fine.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.139
Don't mind me.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.174
I'm just gonna
go kill myself.

14:37.677 --> 14:38.979
What's wrong, Lynly?

14:39.012 --> 14:41.114
I met a guy.
Oh, no, no!

14:41.148 --> 14:42.449
No, a nice guy--
he made me eggs.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.384
Eggs?
Scrambled.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.219
It's like he knew
they were my favorite.

14:46.253 --> 14:49.056
But he said he doesn't want
to see me again.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.058
Who is he?
Just tell me the jerk's name.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.193
I don't know it.

14:53.226 --> 14:56.930
But I wouldn't tell you anyway
because you'll kill him.

14:56.964 --> 15:00.167
If I'm feeling generous.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.102
Excuse me.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.039
(door slams)

15:06.073 --> 15:07.307
Well, I still don't
understand why we had

15:07.340 --> 15:08.308
to leave the Rammer Jammer.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.977
It was too loud.

15:10.010 --> 15:10.978
You wouldn't get
writing done there.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.180
Why write inside when
you can write in nature?

15:13.213 --> 15:15.282
Here.
Great.

15:15.315 --> 15:18.085
The only thing is
we don't have a plug-in.

15:18.118 --> 15:20.687
Oh, actually, I left my plug
somewhere this morning,

15:20.720 --> 15:22.722
so I'm gonna have
to buy a new one.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.491
No, this is BlueBell.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.193
If it's not right
where you left it,

15:26.226 --> 15:28.395
it's because someone found it
and wants to hand-deliver it.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.964
Probably with a
basket of muffins.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.099
I can get used to that.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.200
See?

15:33.233 --> 15:37.104
Get Joel acclimated to
BlueBell-- going perfectly.

15:37.137 --> 15:40.040
Hey, uh, I'm not getting
a Wi-Fi signal,

15:40.073 --> 15:42.309
and my manuscript
is stored on the Cloud.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.111
Okay.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.312
No worries, man.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.314
Because there's definitely

15:47.347 --> 15:49.516
Wi-Fi in BlueBell.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.451
Just got to move a little.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.486
(stammers) Okay.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.226
Pardon me. My GPS isn't working.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.328
I'm trying to find
my way back to Mobile.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.396
Mobile's a dump.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.165
Perhaps.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.000
But I'd still like some
directions if you don't mind.

16:07.034 --> 16:09.269
All right.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.406
Let's see.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.344
Here, let me help you.

16:17.377 --> 16:18.545
Oh, why, thank you.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.213
Absolutely.

16:20.247 --> 16:23.016
Are you planning
to spill a lot?

16:23.050 --> 16:25.052
Oh... (laughs)

16:25.085 --> 16:26.353
No, no, those aren't for me.

16:26.386 --> 16:29.089
They're for a, um,
fine-dining establishment

16:29.122 --> 16:30.557
of which I am the co-owner.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.159
My mother was a businesswoman.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.193
No one I respect more.

16:33.226 --> 16:36.096
Well, there's no one I
respect more than a man

16:36.129 --> 16:37.464
who respects his mother.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.765
(both chuckle)

16:38.798 --> 16:41.168
Oh, uh, where are my manners?

16:41.201 --> 16:42.369
I haven't even
introduced myself.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.804
I'm-I'm Lemon Breeland.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.773
The legendary Lemon Breeland.

16:46.806 --> 16:49.276
Your legacy precedes you.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.577
I'm Carter Covington.

16:50.610 --> 16:54.114
And your name precedes you.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.216
Anything now?

16:56.249 --> 16:59.152
Not a single bar.

16:59.186 --> 17:02.289
You know, why don't we just go
try over by the Hem 'n Haw.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.790
That-that's a real place?

17:03.823 --> 17:07.160
Wow, South,
you do not disappoint.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.205
Huh.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.508
Well, Miss Breeland,
I'm gonna be in Mobile

17:21.540 --> 17:23.276
for the next few days.

17:23.310 --> 17:26.279
If I spill something,
can I give you a call?

17:26.313 --> 17:28.581
The pleasure would be
all mine, Mr. Covington.

17:34.354 --> 17:37.424
(yelling)

17:37.457 --> 17:38.525
Oh, my God! Ow!

17:38.558 --> 17:40.127
(stammers)

17:40.160 --> 17:41.128
Joel?

17:41.161 --> 17:42.562
Ow, ow, something is biting me!

17:42.595 --> 17:43.563
I'm coming!

17:43.596 --> 17:44.564
Oh, God, I was just...

17:44.597 --> 17:45.832
I was sitting there and... ow!

17:45.865 --> 17:47.400
No, no, no!

17:47.434 --> 17:48.568
No one sits on this rock!

17:48.601 --> 17:50.303
Everyone knows
that's Fire Ant Rock.

17:50.337 --> 17:51.871
Not everyone!

17:51.904 --> 17:53.273
We got to get you
to Dr. Breeland.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.274
Oh!
Ooh!

17:54.307 --> 17:55.875
Son of a bitch!

17:55.908 --> 17:58.178
Oh!

18:06.219 --> 18:07.587
Okay.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.323
Remember how I said earlier
that we couldn't break up?

18:10.357 --> 18:11.891
Well, I retract.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.861
What? No, I was kind of enjoying
our fake relationship, huh?

18:14.894 --> 18:16.163
Well, too bad.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.531
A fake relationship
with you may help me

18:18.565 --> 18:21.368
with my Meatball addiction,
but do you know what's sure to?

18:21.401 --> 18:23.870
A real relationship
with an authentic gentleman

18:23.903 --> 18:25.538
not named after
spaghetti's sidekick.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.474
So, in one hour,

18:27.507 --> 18:29.476
I will be leaking to AnnaBeth
that we are having problems.

18:29.509 --> 18:30.477
Deal.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.245
Fine.

18:32.279 --> 18:35.615
I just hope my next fake
girlfriend isn't so bossy.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.617
(winces, groans)
ZOE: Have I said
that I was sorry?

18:37.650 --> 18:39.252
'Cause I am really sorry.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.487
Oh, it's no big deal.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.688
Oh, really?

18:41.721 --> 18:43.290
No, actually, no,
it's a huge deal.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.458
My ass is on fire,
and a man I hardly know

18:45.492 --> 18:47.460
is giving me
an intimate massage.

18:47.494 --> 18:48.928
BRICK:
Well, I apologize, but I am

18:48.961 --> 18:50.630
the only doctor in town.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.299
I thought I banned you.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.500
I'm here as girlfriend,
not doctor.

18:53.533 --> 18:54.401
Well, some girlfriend.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.570
You-you let him sit
on Fire Ant Rock.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.639
All right,
the swelling should subside

18:59.672 --> 19:01.441
in a couple hours,
so you just need

19:01.474 --> 19:03.643
to-to monitor these blisters.

19:03.676 --> 19:06.379
If they start leaking pus,
it means you're infected.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.216
You, in the corner,

19:09.249 --> 19:10.483
hands at your side,

19:10.517 --> 19:12.319
mouth closed.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.587
MAN (over TV): To keep your body
absolutely still

19:14.621 --> 19:18.258
during the putting stroke,
imagine you're trying not

19:18.291 --> 19:20.727
to be noticed
by a pride of lions.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.963
And pray God
they haven't smelled your urine.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.199
This is like
a life-or-death game of golf.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.268
This is...

19:29.469 --> 19:30.503
Hey! I...

19:30.537 --> 19:32.439
I was... I...
George Tucker.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.207
You are Lavon Hayes's lawyer,
and as such,

19:34.241 --> 19:36.309
I need you to make sure
I don't do anything illegal.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.944
Happy to help.
Now, you may
not now this,

19:37.977 --> 19:39.679
but my little cousin
Lynly's in town.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.314
Some punk hurt her.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.949
Now, I'd assume it was Wade,
but he's with Lemon, so...

19:42.982 --> 19:45.218
Wait, I'm sorry.
Wait, back that up.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.553
Did you say Wade
was with Lemon?

19:46.586 --> 19:47.954
As in Lemon and Wade

19:47.987 --> 19:49.256
are... they're together?

19:49.289 --> 19:50.657
Is that...?
Yeah.

19:50.690 --> 19:51.958
So, guys,
what can I get for you?

19:51.991 --> 19:52.925
No, we're plotting,
not eating.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.262
You're dating my ex-fiancée
and didn't think

19:55.295 --> 19:57.264
that information might be
relevant for me to know?

19:57.297 --> 20:00.600
Oh, right, I-I see how
that might bother you, yeah.

20:00.633 --> 20:01.968
You know, 'cause when I dated

20:02.001 --> 20:03.603
your ex-wife,
I asked you first.

20:04.504 --> 20:07.006
Uh, if it helps,

20:07.039 --> 20:08.475
Lemon and I are
apparently having problems.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.343
So, there's that. Yeah.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.579
Geez, Louise, some people
in this town have no respect

20:12.612 --> 20:13.980
for the sanctimony
of fr... well...

20:14.013 --> 20:16.983
you know, don't even
get me started on you.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.385
Oh, come on, man,
we-we moved past that.

20:18.418 --> 20:19.218
Now, I got pressing business.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.254
How do I find this guy,
threaten him,

20:21.288 --> 20:23.490
but not end up in prison?

20:23.523 --> 20:24.591
Ah, what did he do?

20:24.624 --> 20:25.625
He messed with Little Lynly!

20:25.658 --> 20:27.427
(groans)
Anybody can look

20:27.460 --> 20:29.296
in her eyes and see
that she is fragile.

20:29.329 --> 20:30.997
And she's suffering again.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.599
You do not make a-a girl eggs

20:32.632 --> 20:35.268
and then walk out on her.

20:35.302 --> 20:36.269
Eggs.

20:36.303 --> 20:37.504
Mmm.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.407
So, I take it
that Little Lynly,

20:40.440 --> 20:42.642
she's not 14 anymore?

20:42.675 --> 20:44.277
She's 25.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.281
Well, you know,
consenting adults.

20:48.315 --> 20:51.050
Maybe there were some
mitigating factors.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.051
Yeah.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.654
I'll let the dude explain them
right before I put

20:54.687 --> 20:57.357
his nose through his eyes.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.429
Come on.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.030
We've got a future eunuch
to find.

21:04.063 --> 21:06.032
Yeah, yeah, um, we might

21:06.065 --> 21:08.267
just want to just
leave that there.

21:12.539 --> 21:14.441
AnnaBeth, I was just

21:14.474 --> 21:15.675
at the Butter Stick,
and I heard

21:15.708 --> 21:17.510
the most interesting thing.

21:17.544 --> 21:19.646
That you ordered
a cheesecake for tonight.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.714
Now, I know that you
only order cheesecake

21:21.748 --> 21:23.316
when you're having
a dinner party.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.651
Lemon, I'm sorry.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.353
But the only reason
I didn't invite you is

21:26.386 --> 21:28.355
because it's for Zoe Hart
and her boyfriend.

21:28.388 --> 21:29.822
Oh, bup, bup, bup, no,
no need to apologize.

21:29.856 --> 21:31.791
I just need an invitation.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.560
You did hear the
part where I said

21:33.593 --> 21:34.794
it's for Zoe and Joel, right?

21:34.827 --> 21:36.095
Uh-huh, so you'll
definitely need

21:36.128 --> 21:38.431
to invite some people
that I can talk to.

21:38.465 --> 21:39.766
Maybe, uh, Stanley
and Crickett.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.668
Oh, and funny thing,

21:41.701 --> 21:43.536
I ran into Carter Covington,

21:43.570 --> 21:45.572
who's staying in Mobile
for a few days.

21:45.605 --> 21:47.540
Carter Covington?
Mm-hmm.

21:47.574 --> 21:48.675
Bachelor number nine
on your list?
Mm-hmm.

21:48.708 --> 21:49.676
Wait, what about Wade?

21:49.709 --> 21:52.078
Oh, yes, well...

21:52.111 --> 21:55.415
between you and I,
we've been having some problems.

21:55.448 --> 21:58.084
But, I mean, who couldn't
see that coming, right?

21:58.117 --> 21:59.752
I am so confused.

21:59.786 --> 22:02.589
First, you tell me that you're
sleeping with someone

22:02.622 --> 22:03.690
too shameful
to ever admit,

22:03.723 --> 22:05.091
then you told
the whole town

22:05.124 --> 22:06.693
you're dating Wade.
Oh, is Wade the secret guy?

22:06.726 --> 22:08.828
Or is the secret guy

22:08.861 --> 22:10.497
the reason you're having
problems with Wade?

22:10.530 --> 22:14.100
Okay, AnnaBeth, my life is
rapidly going down the commode.

22:14.133 --> 22:15.835
So I need you,
my best friend,

22:15.868 --> 22:19.372
my only friend, to invite me
and Carter Covington

22:19.406 --> 22:21.408
to this dinner party tonight
and trust that one day

22:21.441 --> 22:22.842
it will all make sense!

22:22.875 --> 22:23.843
Of course.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.144
Great!

22:25.177 --> 22:27.113
Well, I'll go home
and steam my party dress.

22:27.146 --> 22:28.748
See you tonight!

22:32.852 --> 22:35.622
What-what did she mean,
"See you tonight"?

22:35.655 --> 22:40.727
Well... there are a few
additions to the guest list.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.395
Like Lemon?

22:42.429 --> 22:44.931
You invited my sworn enemy
to my boyfriend's party?

22:44.964 --> 22:47.634
I'm so, so sorry,
but she needs this.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.536
She and Wade
are having problems.

22:49.569 --> 22:50.870
Problems?

22:50.903 --> 22:51.938
Mmm.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.440
Since when?

22:53.473 --> 22:54.874
I'm not sure exactly.

22:54.907 --> 22:57.644
I only found out
they were dating yesterday.

22:58.678 --> 22:59.879
Yesterday?

22:59.912 --> 23:01.448
Interesting.

23:01.481 --> 23:02.749
So where now?

23:02.782 --> 23:04.951
Uh... (sighs) well,
we've been all over BlueBell,

23:04.984 --> 23:06.886
and no one saw her
with anyone last night,

23:06.919 --> 23:09.489
so I guess we just trust

23:09.522 --> 23:11.491
that the guy really regrets
what he did,

23:11.524 --> 23:14.160
and we just call it a day.

23:14.193 --> 23:15.895
We haven't been
to Torchy's.

23:15.928 --> 23:17.564
Yeah, people always
go to Torchy's

23:17.597 --> 23:19.566
to do things they don't want
anybody to know about!

23:19.599 --> 23:21.634
Oh, no, no, listen, listen,
Lavon, Lavon, hey, hey, hey.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.670
Stop, stop, stop.
Listen.

23:23.703 --> 23:25.572
I know that you are worried,

23:25.605 --> 23:27.774
but I really do think
the healthiest thing

23:27.807 --> 23:30.910
for both of you right now

23:30.943 --> 23:33.746
would just be to... to go home.

23:35.815 --> 23:36.883
(scoffs) You're right.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.918
I can get the truth
out of Lynly

23:38.951 --> 23:40.520
at the dinner party tonight.

23:40.553 --> 23:42.188
Dinner party? I'm sorry, what?

23:42.221 --> 23:43.790
Yeah, for Zoe's new boyfriend.

23:43.823 --> 23:46.793
Joel! Yeah, he seems so great.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.227
Um, look, uh,
would-would it be okay

23:48.260 --> 23:50.497
if I came
to the dinner party tonight?

23:50.530 --> 23:51.764
I mean, I probably should.

23:51.798 --> 23:55.802
You know, just in case you get
tempted to do something stupid.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.804
(chuckles)

23:57.837 --> 23:59.939
Oh! You are a great
friend, George Tucker.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.808
(both chuckle)

24:01.841 --> 24:03.710
Yeah. See you tonight.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.445
Oh, my God.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.882
Wanda, have you seen
Joel's power cord?

24:09.916 --> 24:12.619
We think that he left it here
this morning.

24:12.652 --> 24:15.888
Oh, shoot. I was gonna bake some
muffins and take it to you.

24:15.922 --> 24:17.624
Come on.

24:17.657 --> 24:18.758
(chuckles)

24:18.791 --> 24:20.259
WADE:
Doc...

24:20.292 --> 24:22.629
how's your new boyfriend's
first day in BlueBell going?

24:22.662 --> 24:24.631
So you heard
about the fire ants.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.699
Yeah, Dash posted
some great pics.

24:26.733 --> 24:27.700
It's a setback.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.902
But we are going
to a dinner party at Lavon's,

24:29.936 --> 24:31.237
and it's going to be lovely.

24:31.270 --> 24:32.238
Oh, that sounds
wonderful.

24:32.271 --> 24:33.840
Can he sit?

24:33.873 --> 24:35.975
Okay, maybe I dropped the ball
a little bit.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.243
I was distracted.

24:37.276 --> 24:39.011
But you know
whose fault that is?

24:39.879 --> 24:42.615
Yes, technically, mine.

24:42.649 --> 24:43.750
But I was busy

24:43.783 --> 24:45.752
watching
your fake girlfriend flirt

24:45.785 --> 24:47.854
with another very handsome man.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.656
What?
Mm-hmm.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.057
At least my boyfriend's real.

24:51.090 --> 24:53.025
You're just faking
this whole thing with Lemon

24:53.059 --> 24:54.861
just to get to me.
First of all,

24:54.894 --> 24:56.863
very mature;
second of all,

24:56.896 --> 24:57.730
it's not working.

24:57.764 --> 24:59.265
You may as well
just cut the charade.

24:59.298 --> 25:02.001
You are just so wrong.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.002
Oh, am I?

25:03.035 --> 25:04.003
Top ten wrongest...

25:04.036 --> 25:06.272
Hey! Hi. I got it.

25:06.305 --> 25:07.574
Everything okay?

25:07.607 --> 25:09.008
Yeah, everything's great.
Let's go.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.077
All right.

25:11.110 --> 25:12.979
Y'all have a good night.

25:15.114 --> 25:16.683
Hey, Wanda,

25:16.716 --> 25:19.652
I'm gonna need you to get a tie
out of the lost and found.

25:19.686 --> 25:22.521
I'm meeting my girlfriend Lemon
at a dinner party tonight.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.899
I don't mean to be one of those
harpy women we hate,

25:32.932 --> 25:35.568
but you were supposed to be here
to help me set up.

25:35.602 --> 25:37.303
And now party guests
are arriving

25:37.336 --> 25:39.038
before the party lighting
is ready.

25:39.071 --> 25:41.641
We were trying to track down
the guy that upset Lynly.

25:41.674 --> 25:42.642
Oh! Lynly?

25:42.675 --> 25:44.577
What a surprise!
Hi!

25:44.611 --> 25:46.813
Oh, good to see you!
Thank you for coming!

25:46.846 --> 25:48.715
You two are fighting,
aren't you?

25:48.748 --> 25:51.751
I guess that explains
the party lighting.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.053
ANNABETH:
Voilà!

25:54.086 --> 25:55.888
Ooh.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.327
Oh, Mr. Covington,
so nice to see you.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.929
I can't think

26:02.962 --> 26:04.831
of a better way
to spend an evening...

26:04.864 --> 26:05.732
or more delightful company.

26:05.765 --> 26:09.702
I am Dr. Brick Breeland,
Lemon's father.

26:09.736 --> 26:11.337
Pleased to meet you, sir.
Carter Covington.

26:11.370 --> 26:12.672
Carter.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.941
Well, Daddy,
don't let us keep you.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.342
Oh, nonsense, sweetheart.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.144
Carter, let me tell
you a little story

26:18.177 --> 26:20.813
about a friend of mine
who got so busy at work,

26:20.847 --> 26:23.816
he took his eye off
his lovely daughter.

26:23.850 --> 26:26.819
And she ended up
dating a bartender!

26:26.853 --> 26:29.055
I bet he never let
that happen again.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.056
No, he won't.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.090
(chuckles)

26:31.123 --> 26:32.825
So, uh, Zoe tells me

26:32.859 --> 26:35.061
that you're quite
the football athlete.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.664
Oh, well, uh,
back in the day anyway.

26:37.697 --> 26:40.099
I mean, now I just limit myself
to video games.

26:40.132 --> 26:42.869
Sometimes I get injured
playing those, you know?

26:42.902 --> 26:43.936
(all chuckle)

26:43.970 --> 26:45.972
Shall we?

26:46.005 --> 26:47.807
Lavon used to play
for the NFL,

26:47.840 --> 26:49.676
but around here
he is remembered

26:49.709 --> 26:51.678
as being the star
of the Crimson Tide.

26:51.711 --> 26:52.845
Number 47 was retired

26:52.879 --> 26:54.981
about a second after
he stopped playing.

26:55.014 --> 26:56.883
That's so weird.
There's a guy on Amazon

26:56.916 --> 26:58.384
with the user name
RollTide47.

26:58.417 --> 26:59.986
He must be a big fan.

27:00.019 --> 27:01.120
RollTide47,
that's me.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.154
What?!

27:02.188 --> 27:03.756
I can't believe
you remember that.

27:03.790 --> 27:04.824
Yeah, I have this problem;

27:04.857 --> 27:07.794
um, try as I might,
I remember every bad review

27:07.827 --> 27:08.928
and everyone
who wrote them.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.930
You hated
 The Cicada's Lament.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.032
No, no, no.

27:13.065 --> 27:15.001
You're that Joel Stephens?

27:15.034 --> 27:16.903
Oh, surely,
you didn't hate the book.

27:16.936 --> 27:18.204
He gave it one star.

27:18.237 --> 27:19.806
The majority
of the review

27:19.839 --> 27:20.773
is about his outrage

27:20.807 --> 27:22.975
that Amazon doesn't let you give
zero stars.

27:23.009 --> 27:24.877
Yeah, it wasn't my favorite.

27:24.911 --> 27:26.412
You know what might help us?

27:26.445 --> 27:27.847
Three drinks.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.949
And one for each of you.

27:32.852 --> 27:35.421
Lynly, I'm so
glad you came!

27:35.454 --> 27:37.724
In my dress?

27:37.757 --> 27:39.826
You were so nice
to invite me that I wanted

27:39.859 --> 27:41.427
to do something nice
for you, too.

27:41.460 --> 27:43.062
This is really meant
for someone younger.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.997
George!

27:45.031 --> 27:49.035
Um, George, have you,
um... have you met

27:49.068 --> 27:50.169
Lavon's cousin, Lynly?

27:50.202 --> 27:52.038
Nope, never.
Oh, well,

27:52.071 --> 27:53.940
then you two
will have so much

27:53.973 --> 27:55.875
to talk about.

27:55.908 --> 27:58.911
Oh, welcome
to the party!

27:58.945 --> 28:00.747
Could I talk to you?

28:01.781 --> 28:04.817
I promise these aren't
all for me.

28:08.054 --> 28:09.021
Wade?!

28:09.055 --> 28:10.790
Hey, Doc, good news.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.825
Me and Lemon patched things up.

28:12.859 --> 28:13.926
I know you're worried.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.028
This party is for Joel.

28:16.062 --> 28:17.964
Oh, good thinking--
after the day he's had,

28:17.997 --> 28:19.198
boy could use a party, right?

28:19.231 --> 28:20.767
(chuckles)
Huh?

28:20.800 --> 28:22.068
Hey, grab me a beer, pal.

28:22.101 --> 28:23.936
Thank you.

28:23.970 --> 28:25.938
It's totally fine that
you didn't like my book.

28:25.972 --> 28:28.775
I'm just curious what
exactly you didn't like.

28:28.808 --> 28:31.210
I don't know,
it just wasn't for me.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.945
I get it, I get it.
(chuckles)

28:32.979 --> 28:34.747
Hey, I probably wouldn't
have liked it myself

28:34.781 --> 28:35.948
if I hadn't have written it.

28:35.982 --> 28:36.883
Right.

28:36.916 --> 28:39.251
But what, specifically,
wasn't for you?

28:39.285 --> 28:40.953
I don't remember details.

28:40.987 --> 28:42.288
Actually, if you don't remember
the details,

28:42.321 --> 28:45.958
then maybe you wouldn't
mind deleting the review.

28:45.992 --> 28:47.493
(chuckling):
Uh... no.

28:47.526 --> 28:49.095
See, I wouldn't have been
that harsh

28:49.128 --> 28:50.797
if I didn't really hate it.

28:58.037 --> 28:59.105
Hmm.

28:59.138 --> 29:00.239
I figured I could
blow my trust

29:00.272 --> 29:01.273
on an amazing
year in Europe,

29:01.307 --> 29:02.508
or I could buy
my own company.

29:02.541 --> 29:03.542
(both laugh)

29:03.575 --> 29:04.977
Now I have 15
offices in Europe,

29:05.011 --> 29:06.813
and I can go
any time I want.

29:06.846 --> 29:10.016
Well, you are such a...
an upright young man,

29:10.049 --> 29:11.851
I think I'll just
get out of your hair.

29:11.884 --> 29:12.985
Uh, no!

29:13.019 --> 29:15.855
Um, aren't you concerned
about where in Europe, Daddy?

29:15.888 --> 29:19.525
Oh, uh, yeah.
Uh, Carter, let me...

29:19.558 --> 29:20.893
let me ask you a question.

29:20.927 --> 29:22.995
Uh, you spend much
time in France?

29:23.029 --> 29:24.063
Because I'm a
little concerned

29:24.096 --> 29:26.165
about the loose moral
structure of that country.

29:27.934 --> 29:30.536
You, now, come.

29:30.569 --> 29:32.939
Look, last night,
I obviously did not know

29:32.972 --> 29:34.073
that you were
Lavon's cousin.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.541
And I also somehow
missed the fact

29:35.574 --> 29:38.945
that you are in a very
vulnerable state.

29:38.978 --> 29:40.279
And I'm very sorry.

29:40.312 --> 29:41.547
I feel like a chump.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.282
No, I'm sorry.
It was a one-night thing.

29:43.315 --> 29:44.951
We both knew.
I shouldn't have pushed.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.152
Great, great!

29:46.185 --> 29:49.021
Now, if you could somehow
not tell Lavon that it was me,

29:49.055 --> 29:50.990
that would be swell
because he is a friend.

29:51.023 --> 29:52.558
But a friend is not
going to be so forgiving

29:52.591 --> 29:54.160
of another friend taking
advantage of his very young,

29:54.193 --> 29:55.962
vulnerable cousin.

29:55.995 --> 29:57.196
Also, I like my legs.

29:57.229 --> 29:58.898
Okay, I won't tell him...

29:58.931 --> 30:01.167
if you answer this question.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.202
You're great, I'm great,

30:03.235 --> 30:06.305
so why does it have to be
a one-time thing?

30:06.338 --> 30:08.307
All right,
listen, Lynly.

30:08.340 --> 30:11.110
I cannot even
conceive of starting

30:11.143 --> 30:13.179
a new relationship
right now.

30:13.212 --> 30:14.881
And that is not
gonna change.

30:14.914 --> 30:19.185
Well, I guess there's nothing
much else to say, is there?

30:19.218 --> 30:21.220
Just that I really do
like my legs.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.890
You know, walking,
biking, wearing pants.

30:23.923 --> 30:26.125
Hey, George, uh,
could you give us a sec?

30:26.158 --> 30:28.160
I need to talk to Lynly.

30:28.194 --> 30:30.329
Funny,
I have to talk to you, too.

30:36.235 --> 30:38.204
So, no one knew
until yesterday

30:38.237 --> 30:40.006
that Lemon and Wade
were dating?

30:40.039 --> 30:42.408
No. All we knew
was she'd been

30:42.441 --> 30:44.010
secretly sleeping
with someone.

30:44.043 --> 30:46.112
And you didn't know
who that someone was?

30:46.145 --> 30:47.646
Well, I thought it was

30:47.679 --> 30:50.016
that well-toned banker
from Mobile.
Robert?

30:50.049 --> 30:52.651
No, Robert's the one with
the perfectly tailored suits.

30:52.684 --> 30:53.953
I was talking
about Adam,

30:53.986 --> 30:55.121
with the really good hair.

30:55.154 --> 30:56.188
Oh.
Yeah.

30:56.222 --> 30:58.357
Anyway, now we know why
Lemon kept it a secret.

30:58.390 --> 31:01.093
I mean, who would ever admit
they were with Wade?

31:01.127 --> 31:03.229
(both snicker)

31:03.262 --> 31:05.297
Sorry.

31:05.331 --> 31:06.632
Mmm.

31:06.665 --> 31:08.267
STANLEY:
Oh.

31:09.468 --> 31:12.038
Okay, look, I understand
you want to protect this guy.

31:12.071 --> 31:13.439
Just tell me his name.

31:13.472 --> 31:16.142
I can't-- not just to protect
him, but to protect you.

31:16.175 --> 31:19.011
Whoa, whoa, now, Lavon Hayes
does not need protecting.

31:19.045 --> 31:20.913
I know how much you love me.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.124
There is no reason for
you to be here, okay?

31:32.158 --> 31:33.392
You hate dinner parties.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.194
And this is not
even your tie!

31:35.227 --> 31:36.462
Zoe thinks we're faking
the relationship.

31:36.495 --> 31:38.364
We are faking
the relationship!

31:38.397 --> 31:41.667
Well, I don't want her
to know that.

31:41.700 --> 31:46.405
Wade, Carter Covington is the
first truly eligible bachelor

31:46.438 --> 31:49.208
I have met in a
really long time.

31:50.977 --> 31:53.212
Do you know what you're
asking me to give up?

31:55.081 --> 31:57.249
Yeah, I do.

31:59.385 --> 32:02.154
Hey, have you seen Lavon?
I'm thinking he didn't realize

32:02.188 --> 32:04.390
that chapter seven is
an alternate reality.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.359
Try over by the crawfish table.

32:07.393 --> 32:09.161
But don't eat the crab cakes.

32:09.195 --> 32:11.998
They're fried in peanut oil.

32:12.031 --> 32:14.466
I always like to meet any
woman's family I plan to date

32:14.500 --> 32:16.302
just to make sure
they approve of me.

32:16.335 --> 32:17.336
Oh, we do.

32:17.369 --> 32:18.504
(both chuckle)

32:18.537 --> 32:20.272
LEMON:
Carter, I would like
to introduce you

32:20.306 --> 32:21.473
to someone.

32:21.507 --> 32:24.310
Um, this is
my boyfriend Wade.

32:24.343 --> 32:26.312
Oh, no.

32:26.345 --> 32:28.214
WADE:
We, uh... we run
the Rammer Jammer together.

32:28.247 --> 32:29.448
Yes, no one would
ever predict

32:29.481 --> 32:31.050
that we would
fall in love,

32:31.083 --> 32:33.519
but you stare at someone
for 14 hours a day, and...

32:33.552 --> 32:34.520
WADE:
Especially someone as tasty

32:34.553 --> 32:36.122
as this little nugget.
Come on.

32:36.155 --> 32:37.123
Crazy things happen.

32:37.156 --> 32:38.357
Catfish cake?

32:42.094 --> 32:45.131
So, how did you two
finally get together?

32:45.164 --> 32:47.133
Well...
Well...

32:47.166 --> 32:50.369
...I was waiting
on table six.

32:50.402 --> 32:52.738
And we still argue whether
it was buffalo wings

32:52.771 --> 32:54.540
or jalapeño poppers.
Jalapeño poppers.

32:55.574 --> 32:57.143
Catfish cake!

32:57.176 --> 32:59.011
No, it was definitely
not catfish cakes.

32:59.045 --> 33:00.012
(coughing)

33:00.046 --> 33:00.946
You okay?

33:00.979 --> 33:03.249
The catfish cakes
are fried in peanut oil!

33:03.282 --> 33:04.516
(wheezing)
Hey!
It's fried in peanut oil!

33:04.550 --> 33:05.517
He's allergic!

33:05.551 --> 33:07.419
Get his EpiPen out of my purse!

33:07.453 --> 33:09.455
(coughs, wheezes)
Okay.

33:20.799 --> 33:22.234
Your heart's
stopped racing.

33:22.268 --> 33:23.435
How are you
feeling?

33:23.469 --> 33:24.303
Well, the good news is

33:24.336 --> 33:26.272
I don't feel
the fire ant bites anymore.

33:26.305 --> 33:29.175
Joel, I am so sorry.

33:29.208 --> 33:30.142
I'm the worst girlfriend
in the world.

33:30.176 --> 33:33.045
I tried to warn you
about the catfish cakes,

33:33.079 --> 33:34.513
and then you weren't there,
and...

33:34.546 --> 33:36.315
I got distracted...

33:36.348 --> 33:38.284
You remember
that guy Wade, right?

33:38.317 --> 33:40.186
Paul Bunyan?
Yeah, he's hard to forget.

33:40.219 --> 33:42.521
Well, I think he's faking
his relationship with Lemon.

33:42.554 --> 33:45.257
And it's driving me crazy
that I can't prove it.

33:45.291 --> 33:48.194
So, why would Wade
be faking a relationship?

33:48.227 --> 33:51.797
Maybe he freaked out
because I reappeared,

33:51.830 --> 33:53.799
awesome boyfriend in tow.

33:53.832 --> 33:55.501
Or-or maybe he's
just messing

33:55.534 --> 33:56.802
with my head.

33:56.835 --> 33:58.804
Regardless,
I fell into his trap,

33:58.837 --> 34:00.606
and I am so, so sorry.

34:00.639 --> 34:03.142
Well...

34:03.175 --> 34:05.377
you're not the one
faking a relationship.

34:06.845 --> 34:08.114
That's true.

34:08.147 --> 34:09.181
You behaved like anyone

34:09.215 --> 34:11.850
who found their ex-boyfriend
dating their archenemy.

34:11.882 --> 34:14.320
Also true.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.322
I'm a much better girlfriend
than I thought.

34:16.355 --> 34:17.589
Now, now, now...

34:17.623 --> 34:20.559
let's not get ahead
of ourselves here.

34:20.592 --> 34:24.463
But the writer in me

34:24.496 --> 34:27.233
needs to know
if they really are faking.

34:27.266 --> 34:28.567
So...

34:28.600 --> 34:30.202
give me the details,
let's figure this out.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.438
Um...

34:32.471 --> 34:34.273
when did you first hear
they were dating?

34:36.442 --> 34:38.844
It's just such a shame
you turned up

34:38.877 --> 34:40.646
right after Lemon
got together with Wade.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.514
I mean, timing, huh?

34:42.547 --> 34:43.549
Crickett!

34:45.184 --> 34:46.185
Excuse me.

34:50.222 --> 34:52.224
Carter... listen.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.260
Your opinion of
me matters, so

34:54.293 --> 34:56.462
I have a confession
to make.

34:56.495 --> 34:57.696
In confidence.

34:59.498 --> 35:01.867
Wade and I are faking
our relationship.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.469
What?

35:03.502 --> 35:04.603
Why?

35:04.636 --> 35:07.273
See, he needs to
triumph over Zoe Hart,

35:07.306 --> 35:09.275
and if you knew Zoe Hart,
you would understand.

35:09.308 --> 35:11.877
Now, I don't normally
participate in such antics,

35:11.910 --> 35:13.712
but Wade is a friend.

35:16.282 --> 35:17.483
And he's sick.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.886
It's terminal.

35:20.919 --> 35:22.488
That's tragic.

35:22.521 --> 35:24.256
It is.

35:25.924 --> 35:27.359
You should know
that my family's

35:27.393 --> 35:29.495
had its share of scandal.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.630
We can't withstand any more.

35:31.663 --> 35:34.633
So I have to be sure
that any woman I date

35:34.666 --> 35:36.402
has an unblemished record.

35:36.435 --> 35:38.604
Any woman you date?

35:38.637 --> 35:40.506
Well...

35:40.539 --> 35:42.908
I assure you, Mr. Covington,

35:42.941 --> 35:46.378
there are no more
skeletons in my closet.

35:46.412 --> 35:47.713
And no one knew
about the relationship

35:47.746 --> 35:49.348
until you came
to town?

35:49.381 --> 35:51.250
No. Her best friend didn't
even know until yesterday.

35:51.283 --> 35:52.251
All right.

35:52.284 --> 35:53.585
They're totally faking it.

35:53.619 --> 35:54.720
Right?

35:54.753 --> 35:56.322
You should write
detective novels.

35:56.355 --> 35:57.923
Wade's motive is clear.

35:57.956 --> 35:59.925
But Lemon's,
we're not gonna know hers

35:59.958 --> 36:02.628
until we unmask
her secret lover.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.930
(giggles)

36:04.963 --> 36:06.932
Will it hold?

36:06.965 --> 36:08.500
I need, like,
ten minutes.

36:08.534 --> 36:10.569
Oh, thank goodness!

36:11.670 --> 36:13.439
Nothing kills
a dinner party

36:13.472 --> 36:16.342
like the guest of honor,
you know, being killed.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.444
Well, I had excellent
medical attention.

36:20.979 --> 36:22.248
Let's eat!

36:22.281 --> 36:23.549
(guests cheering)

36:23.582 --> 36:25.417
Yeah!
(whoops)

36:25.451 --> 36:27.286
Come on,
there you go!

36:27.319 --> 36:28.754
All right!

36:28.787 --> 36:31.557
There it goes!

36:31.590 --> 36:32.958
Okay!

36:32.991 --> 36:35.427
(guests clapping, whooping)

36:35.461 --> 36:37.529
Hey, hey, hey, wh-what
are you doing here?

36:37.563 --> 36:39.731
Well, I brought you
some apology beers.

36:39.765 --> 36:40.732
But you weren't home,

36:40.766 --> 36:42.434
so I drank 'em
while I was waiting.

36:42.468 --> 36:44.336
N-No need for apology.

36:44.370 --> 36:45.737
MEATBALL:
And then I looked over here
and saw the lights

36:45.771 --> 36:48.440
and thought maybe
you came to the party.

36:48.474 --> 36:49.641
And I was hungry.

36:49.675 --> 36:50.709
Look, wh-why don't we just

36:50.742 --> 36:52.311
walk you back over to my place?

36:52.344 --> 36:53.345
What do you say?
No!

36:53.379 --> 36:55.281
I have to tell you something.

36:55.314 --> 36:57.283
Lemon is cheating on you.

36:57.316 --> 36:58.417
No. No, I mean...

36:59.618 --> 37:00.719
What a joker, right?
This guy.

37:00.752 --> 37:01.987
Meatball?
(laughs)

37:02.020 --> 37:03.355
Why don't we talk
about this later?

37:03.389 --> 37:04.590
Lemon, who is this?

37:04.623 --> 37:05.991
Who are you?

37:06.024 --> 37:08.427
Oh, well, he is
an upstanding young man

37:08.460 --> 37:10.729
who happens to be here
with my daughter.

37:10.762 --> 37:12.398
Carter Covington, of the
Birmingham Covingtons.

37:15.701 --> 37:17.603
Well, I am Meatball.

37:17.636 --> 37:19.338
No last name required.

37:19.371 --> 37:21.473
Like Cher and Jesus.

37:21.507 --> 37:24.676
And you may want to know
that your date

37:24.710 --> 37:29.748
has been recently intimate
with not only Wade,

37:29.781 --> 37:32.618
but also with a special
certain someone

37:32.651 --> 37:34.753
I like to call myself.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.422
(guests gasping)

37:36.455 --> 37:38.624
(guests murmuring quietly)

37:38.657 --> 37:41.460
No one ever suspects
the guy named Meatball.

37:42.528 --> 37:44.029
WADE:
Thank you.

37:44.062 --> 37:46.298
Yeah, I'm going to the bar.

37:46.332 --> 37:48.834
If he's Lemon's secret lover,
then who is Wade?

37:48.867 --> 37:50.068
Her beard!

37:50.101 --> 37:51.370
Crawfish, anyone?

37:51.403 --> 37:53.071
I want some.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.806
What's a beard?

38:04.683 --> 38:06.685
(sighs heavily)

38:11.623 --> 38:13.659
You know, you shouldn't
drink alone.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.527
People will judge.

38:21.833 --> 38:24.403
You're a good
friend, Lemon.

38:24.436 --> 38:27.539
Your, uh, gentleman
caller take off?

38:28.874 --> 38:30.409
(sighs)

38:30.442 --> 38:33.645
Frankly, I think my father
is taking it worse than I am.

38:33.679 --> 38:35.681
It's Carter's loss.

38:37.449 --> 38:39.418
"Of the Birmingham
Covingtons."

38:39.451 --> 38:40.919
(chuckling):
I mean, come on.

38:47.593 --> 38:49.428
George,
we need to talk.

38:49.461 --> 38:51.597
Yes, of course we do.

38:52.864 --> 38:54.099
We need a favor.

38:54.132 --> 38:55.567
A favor?

38:55.601 --> 38:56.402
See, I've been
forever trying

38:56.435 --> 38:58.604
to convince Lynly
to go to law school.

38:58.637 --> 39:00.105
LYNLY:
And I've just realized

39:00.138 --> 39:01.407
it's a great idea.

39:01.440 --> 39:02.808
But I need to study
for my LSATs.

39:02.841 --> 39:05.577
So I was hoping
you would tutor her.

39:05.611 --> 39:06.878
Please?

39:10.482 --> 39:12.418
Uh, yeah. Sure.

39:12.451 --> 39:13.485
Of course, I'd...

39:13.519 --> 39:15.654
I'll see you soon, then.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.723
Can't wait.

39:20.492 --> 39:21.827
She's a terrible student.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.795
You're gonna have your work
cut out for you.

39:23.829 --> 39:25.831
Thanks.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.801
Yeah.

39:29.835 --> 39:31.503
No problem.

39:41.647 --> 39:43.849
Hey.

39:43.882 --> 39:47.152
(clears throat)

39:47.185 --> 39:49.921
So, here's the thing.

39:49.955 --> 39:53.759
Seeing you with someone else
kind of freaks me out.

39:53.792 --> 39:56.662
More than I thought it would.

39:56.695 --> 39:59.565
And I'm guessing
that it's not fun for you

39:59.598 --> 40:01.533
to see me
with Joel, either.

40:02.701 --> 40:04.770
(Zoe sighs)

40:04.803 --> 40:07.639
You're not saying anything?

40:07.673 --> 40:08.907
Okay.

40:08.940 --> 40:11.677
Fine.

40:11.710 --> 40:14.680
But we need to figure out
a way to coexist.

40:14.713 --> 40:17.215
Be okay
with each other moving on.

40:17.248 --> 40:20.819
Because it's
a really small town.

40:28.827 --> 40:30.796
Got a big-ass mosquito
on your neck.

40:31.830 --> 40:32.831
What?

40:32.864 --> 40:33.732
Ow!

40:33.765 --> 40:35.801
Where?
Nah, you...
you missed him.

40:35.834 --> 40:37.636
You should probably try again.
Harder.

40:37.669 --> 40:39.471
Where is it?
Did I get it?

40:39.505 --> 40:41.607
Yeah, uh... no.
Where is it?

40:41.640 --> 40:42.941
Actually, now... now it's two.

40:44.510 --> 40:45.644
Oh.

40:45.677 --> 40:46.812
I hate you.

40:46.845 --> 40:48.747
(laughs)

40:55.621 --> 40:58.924
Three questions: One, Meatball?

40:58.957 --> 41:00.559
Two, seriously?

41:00.592 --> 41:03.729
And three, is Crickett's husband
gay or just Southern?

41:04.996 --> 41:07.533
And you've just played
BlueBell's favorite game.

41:07.566 --> 41:10.235
I love how great you're
being about everything.

41:10.268 --> 41:12.971
I mean, after a day
of fire ants,

41:13.004 --> 41:14.973
anaphylactic shock
and Tom Long,

41:15.006 --> 41:16.842
I was sure you were
gonna be on

41:16.875 --> 41:18.544
the first flight
back to New York.

41:18.577 --> 41:19.511
Well, to be honest with you,

41:19.545 --> 41:21.647
that's all I could think
about this morning.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.014
I just...
I get so much

41:23.048 --> 41:24.983
creative energy from
the city, you know?

41:25.016 --> 41:27.753
There's so much life there,
and so much drama and craziness,

41:27.786 --> 41:29.821
and I was afraid I was
throwing all that away.

41:29.855 --> 41:31.557
But BlueBell...

41:31.590 --> 41:33.058
I mean...

41:33.091 --> 41:36.562
two people named after foods
were secretly doing it.

41:36.595 --> 41:37.462
(laughs)

41:37.495 --> 41:40.866
Technically, Lemon
is named after a flower.

41:40.899 --> 41:43.001
Wow, also fascinating.

41:43.034 --> 41:44.770
(sighs)

41:44.803 --> 41:45.771
(sighs)

41:45.804 --> 41:48.574
So...

41:48.607 --> 41:51.977
any other exes you
want to tell me about?

41:52.010 --> 41:53.679
Why did that
George Tucker guy

41:53.712 --> 41:54.880
refuse to shake
my hand?

41:54.913 --> 41:56.682
There's some stuff

41:56.715 --> 41:58.584
that we should just
save for later.
(chuckles)
