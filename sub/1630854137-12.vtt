WEBVTT

00:04.221 --> 00:06.180
<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>

00:06.180 --> 00:07.485
<i>sexually based offenses</i>

00:07.485 --> 00:09.792
<i>are considered
especially heinous.</i>

00:09.792 --> 00:12.360
<i>In New York City,
the dedicated detectives</i>

00:12.360 --> 00:14.144
<i>who investigate
these vicious felonies</i>

00:14.144 --> 00:15.624
<i>are members of an elite squad</i>

00:15.624 --> 00:17.843
<i>known as
the Special Victims Unit.</i>

00:17.843 --> 00:19.410
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:21.804 --> 00:25.155
I want confirmation
that Oscar Papa

00:25.155 --> 00:26.330
put the hit out on me.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.549
I don't kill people, Captain.

00:27.549 --> 00:30.334
No, you have kids
do it for you.

00:30.334 --> 00:33.381
I wanna show you something.

00:33.381 --> 00:39.387
100 open rapes perpetrated
by known BX9 recruiters.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.998
<i>Maria Garcia ID'd both
Bugbear and Sacrilege</i>

00:41.998 --> 00:43.347
<i>as the guys who raped her.</i>

00:43.347 --> 00:44.609
Can we get her to testify?

00:44.609 --> 00:46.089
So far, no.

00:46.089 --> 00:47.699
Benny Barros.

00:47.699 --> 00:50.354
My client has all his boss's
phone conversations on tape.

00:50.354 --> 00:51.964
And he's willing to testify.

00:51.964 --> 00:53.531
Yes.

00:53.531 --> 00:55.055
Oscar Papa,
you're under arrest

00:55.055 --> 00:57.448
for rape and attempted murder.

00:59.798 --> 01:00.886
<i>Everything okay?</i>

01:00.886 --> 01:02.497
<i>Just found out
my cousin's dead.</i>

01:02.497 --> 01:04.847
<i>Stabbed in Green Haven,
along with his friend, Sabo.</i>

01:04.847 --> 01:06.240
<i>Oh, what happened?</i>

01:06.240 --> 01:07.545
<i>The cops put them
on the same block</i>

01:07.545 --> 01:10.461
<i>in Green Haven as 19th Street.</i>

01:10.461 --> 01:11.854
After that subway thing?

01:11.854 --> 01:13.203
Yeah.

01:13.203 --> 01:15.205
Just trying to flip them.

01:15.205 --> 01:17.164
This Duarte guy,
he have any kids?

01:17.164 --> 01:20.776
No, but that bitch
from the news does.

01:20.776 --> 01:22.256
- Benson?
- Yeah.

01:22.256 --> 01:23.866
She got a son.

01:23.866 --> 01:25.520
All right.

01:25.520 --> 01:28.000
We're gonna make this right.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.350
<i>How?</i>

01:29.350 --> 01:31.091
<i>You know the rule--
blood for blood.</i>

01:31.091 --> 01:34.224
<i>Get some principiantes
to chop the little bastard up,</i>

01:34.224 --> 01:36.052
<i>right in front of her.</i>

01:38.141 --> 01:39.751
You heard enough?

01:39.751 --> 01:43.842
My client was in distress,
expressing frustration.

01:43.842 --> 01:46.106
There is a difference
between intent and hyperbole.

01:46.106 --> 01:50.371
Well, unfortunately,
this sick bastard's hyperbole

01:50.371 --> 01:51.763
carries a lot of weight.

01:51.763 --> 01:53.809
Benny Barros is an
amoral opportunist

01:53.809 --> 01:57.160
who secretly recorded my client
in exchange for what?

01:57.160 --> 02:00.120
<i>Citizenship and a safehouse
about as far away</i>

02:00.120 --> 02:01.599
<i>from your client as possible.</i>

02:01.599 --> 02:03.775
Benny, he's playing you.

02:03.775 --> 02:07.301
I think you'll find once
your anger settles, that it is

02:07.301 --> 02:09.825
the very man that you have
in witness protection

02:09.825 --> 02:12.001
who ordered a group of kids
to attack you

02:12.001 --> 02:13.437
and your son with machetes.

02:13.437 --> 02:16.005
Captain Benson,
as I've stated,

02:16.005 --> 02:18.355
I'm sorry you were hurt.

02:18.355 --> 02:20.270
But it pains me more that
your son was traumatized--

02:20.270 --> 02:26.233
If you say one more word

02:26.233 --> 02:30.106
about my son,

02:30.106 --> 02:32.717
it will be your last.

02:35.024 --> 02:36.808
<i>I think we're done here.</i>

02:36.808 --> 02:38.462
<i>We'll be charging your client
with multiple counts</i>

02:38.462 --> 02:40.203
<i>of rape in the first,
not to mention</i>

02:40.203 --> 02:43.815
<i>attempted murder of a police
officer and her son.</i>

02:53.912 --> 02:56.654
That was a huge mistake letting
you go in there by yourself.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.830
Counselor Swope
is gonna claim NYPD bias.

02:58.830 --> 03:02.530
Promise me that
he'll be convicted

03:02.530 --> 03:08.188
because I need to know
that Noah is safe

03:08.188 --> 03:10.364
before I bring him home.

03:14.281 --> 03:16.631
Oscar Papa, you are charged

03:16.631 --> 03:19.242
with 19 counts of rape
in the first.

03:19.242 --> 03:20.983
How do you plead?
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

03:20.983 --> 03:23.333
And on the two counts
of attempted murder

03:23.333 --> 03:25.248
in the second?
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

03:25.248 --> 03:26.684
People on bail?

03:26.684 --> 03:28.773
Oscar Papa is a career
criminal who ordered

03:28.773 --> 03:30.993
the gangland style hit
of an NYPD captain

03:30.993 --> 03:32.560
and her 11-year-old son.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.431
He is the acknowledged leader
of BX9,

03:34.431 --> 03:36.564
and he's guilty of
participation in at least

03:36.564 --> 03:38.043
100 rapes--that we know of.

03:38.043 --> 03:39.480
We request remand.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.221
Your Honor,
these murder charges

03:41.221 --> 03:42.787
are up to interpretation.

03:42.787 --> 03:44.920
The defense intends
to paint Oscar Papa

03:44.920 --> 03:47.662
as some kind of local
youth advocate when, in fact,

03:47.662 --> 03:50.273
we all know that he is the head
of a criminal organization

03:50.273 --> 03:52.797
that could more accurately
be described as a death cult.

03:52.797 --> 03:54.364
He has never been
charged with a crime.

03:54.364 --> 03:55.931
Well, he is now.

03:55.931 --> 03:59.195
Defendant is remanded
to Rikers pending trial.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.240
Next case.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.719
Must feel good.

04:03.112 --> 04:05.114
You wanna clean up our trash
like the Italian cops

04:05.114 --> 04:06.637
did with the Mob?

04:06.637 --> 04:09.423
Let's save the fist bumps
til this prick's in prison.

04:13.601 --> 04:15.429
Well, DOJ's pulling out
of the Bronx.

04:15.429 --> 04:16.865
You know what that means.

04:16.865 --> 04:18.432
You got a whole crew
of new detectives

04:18.432 --> 04:19.607
you gotta break in.

04:19.607 --> 04:22.131
Hell no. I'm done.
I told you.

04:22.131 --> 04:24.786
That deaf girl case was my last
piece of unfinished business.

04:24.786 --> 04:27.571
What, you got some kind of
monogrammed hammock in Mexico

04:27.571 --> 04:29.834
I don't know about?

04:29.834 --> 04:32.402
Believe me,
a settlement like that

04:32.402 --> 04:33.751
isn't as good as it sounds.

04:33.751 --> 04:36.319
You expect me
to believe that, right?

04:36.319 --> 04:37.755
Uncle Sam took half of it.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.279
My ex-wife, Rose,
took the rest.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.715
Poor Bruno.

04:40.715 --> 04:43.587
So thank you
for picking up the check.

04:43.587 --> 04:45.589
You're not fooling anybody, Bruno.

04:45.589 --> 04:46.895
All right, tell you what.

04:46.895 --> 04:48.766
Let's put your
detective skills to the test.

04:48.766 --> 04:49.941
Let's go.

04:49.941 --> 04:51.334
If you can tell me
what I have left

04:51.334 --> 04:53.989
within one million,
I'll pick up the tab.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.556
Okay.

04:55.556 --> 04:58.080
Judging from the way you threw
that Patek at that lab rat

04:58.080 --> 04:59.908
like your wrist was on fire,

04:59.908 --> 05:02.476
I'm guessing
you got at least half

05:02.476 --> 05:05.087
of that kickin'
around somewhere.

05:05.087 --> 05:06.306
Am I right?

05:07.829 --> 05:10.266
Close enough.

05:10.266 --> 05:12.007
Just in time.

05:12.007 --> 05:14.226
Phoebe wants me home.

05:14.226 --> 05:17.012
So what are you gonna
do now--climb Machu Picchu?

05:17.012 --> 05:18.230
Surf the Gold Coast?

05:18.230 --> 05:20.450
Ah, I don't know.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.670
Probably sleep in for once.

05:22.670 --> 05:25.150
Find Rose on a dating app
and swipe right.

05:25.150 --> 05:26.369
That sounds healthy.

05:26.369 --> 05:27.718
Hey, yo, Orlando!

05:27.718 --> 05:29.372
Stop! What the hell?
- What?

05:29.372 --> 05:30.982
Everything okay? We're cops.

05:30.982 --> 05:33.420
- I thought I heard something.
- Like what?

05:33.420 --> 05:34.986
I don't know,
but I heard something.

05:34.986 --> 05:36.988
Yeah?

05:42.124 --> 05:43.995
Orlando, stop the compactor!

05:43.995 --> 05:46.041
Okay!

06:01.230 --> 06:02.753
Open up the back.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.455
She's alive!

06:08.455 --> 06:10.805
She's barely breathing.

06:10.805 --> 06:14.025
Blue-gray lips--
looks like an OD.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.033
The hell is that?

06:22.033 --> 06:23.557
Some kind of dart.

06:23.557 --> 06:27.299
Send me a bus, corner
of Bryant and Hunts Point.

06:27.299 --> 06:28.866
Hey.

06:28.866 --> 06:30.128
Hey!

06:30.128 --> 06:31.434
Can you tell me what happened?

06:34.655 --> 06:36.961
I was raped.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.443
We got you.

06:40.443 --> 06:42.576
We got you, okay?

07:31.363 --> 07:33.365
She was pretty out of it
when we found her,

07:33.365 --> 07:36.107
but she said she was raped.

07:36.107 --> 07:38.762
I found blood in
her underwear, semen.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.111
Arms are bruised up
pretty good.

07:40.111 --> 07:41.243
She was held down.

07:41.243 --> 07:42.940
At least until
the Wildnil kicked in.

07:42.940 --> 07:44.028
Wildnil?

07:44.028 --> 07:45.769
The tranquilizer dart
you found.

07:45.769 --> 07:48.729
Tested positive
for a potent opioid.

07:48.729 --> 07:50.252
Lucky she's a heroin addict.

07:50.252 --> 07:52.515
What makes you say that?

07:52.515 --> 07:53.908
Already has
a built up tolerance.

07:53.908 --> 07:56.084
She's gonna
pull through, right?

07:56.084 --> 07:58.826
I've never had to use
three doses of Narcan before.

08:10.533 --> 08:11.926
Wow.

08:34.688 --> 08:37.647
Excuse me.

08:37.647 --> 08:39.431
Liv?
<i>- Hey.</i>

08:39.431 --> 08:43.131
So I'm just heading up
to Carisi's to prep witnesses.

08:43.131 --> 08:44.436
You coming?

08:44.436 --> 08:45.655
I wish I could,
but evidently,

08:45.655 --> 08:47.483
I'm incapable
of making it south

08:47.483 --> 08:48.876
of the Washington Bridge.

08:48.876 --> 08:50.660
Hold on, you're still up
in the Bronx?

08:50.660 --> 08:52.967
Yeah, me and Bruno
stumbled onto a case.

08:52.967 --> 08:55.404
Oh, your new best friend?

08:55.404 --> 08:57.885
All right, Fin,
are you leaving me too?

08:57.885 --> 08:59.843
You've always been
and will always be

08:59.843 --> 09:01.715
my sister from another mister.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.194
But I just can't drop this
in the lap

09:03.194 --> 09:05.980
of some green
Bronx SVU detectives.

09:05.980 --> 09:08.156
The woman was raped
and dumped in the back

09:08.156 --> 09:09.810
of a garbage truck.

09:09.810 --> 09:11.420
Well, then,
you owe me a favor.

09:11.420 --> 09:12.726
All right.

09:12.726 --> 09:15.859
Let me call you
Amanda from now on.

09:15.859 --> 09:18.383
Okay, and tell Carisi
don't wait up for me.

09:18.383 --> 09:20.081
I'll be working late.

09:28.393 --> 09:30.308
Listen, hon, why don't you
take another sip

09:30.308 --> 09:32.310
of that cola and slow down?

09:32.310 --> 09:34.312
I got low blood sugar.

09:34.312 --> 09:36.184
You wanna tell us how
you wound up in the back

09:36.184 --> 09:38.229
of that garbage truck?

09:38.229 --> 09:39.709
I pretended I was dead.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.493
Yeah, you pretended
you were dead for who?

09:41.493 --> 09:43.147
That's the question.

09:43.147 --> 09:44.279
Some white boy.

09:44.279 --> 09:45.933
Can you tell us
what he looked like?

09:45.933 --> 09:48.544
Hell, all you white boys
look alike to me.

09:48.544 --> 09:50.067
Whoa, whoa,
where are you going?

09:51.678 --> 09:53.201
You cops.

09:53.201 --> 09:54.594
Somebody catch me
talking to you,

09:54.594 --> 09:55.725
my pimp is gonna kill me.

09:55.725 --> 09:57.248
Someone attacked you.

09:57.248 --> 09:58.902
The nurse found evidence
that he may have

09:58.902 --> 10:01.383
forced himself on you.

10:01.383 --> 10:02.645
Ain't the first time.

10:02.645 --> 10:04.429
Don't you want us
to catch who did this?

10:04.429 --> 10:08.695
If I don't earn, I get beat.

10:08.695 --> 10:09.826
How much are you
making a night?

10:12.307 --> 10:14.265
On a good night?

10:14.265 --> 10:17.094
Two, three.

10:17.094 --> 10:18.400
Here then.

10:23.187 --> 10:24.406
That's enough
for a great night.

10:26.495 --> 10:27.888
He crazy or something?

10:27.888 --> 10:29.411
Yeah, but he's a good dude.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.458
What do you want
in return for it?

10:33.458 --> 10:35.286
The truth.

10:35.286 --> 10:37.680
Tell us everything you know
about the guy who hurt you.

10:40.074 --> 10:45.427
After I passed out, I woke up
in some kind of tile room.

10:45.427 --> 10:47.211
And he was spraying me down
with a hose.

10:47.211 --> 10:50.911
Do you remember
anything else?

10:50.911 --> 10:54.044
It was like a medical room.

10:54.044 --> 10:57.134
Then he kind of just
did it to me.

10:57.134 --> 10:59.223
Next thing I knew,
I was in a dumpster.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.881
We done here?

11:04.881 --> 11:07.362
Just promise us you'll
go home and get some rest.

11:10.017 --> 11:14.282
If it's okay with you,
I think I'll stay here.

11:19.156 --> 11:20.984
We have our witnesses
prepped, the few that we have.

11:20.984 --> 11:22.420
We got Benny Barros.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.379
Benny's not the most
reliable guy I've ever met.

11:24.379 --> 11:25.728
Carisi's right.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.121
Yeah, the guy
keeps making demands.

11:27.121 --> 11:28.775
I mean, last night,
it was a strict vegan menu.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.602
What happens
if he changes his mind?

11:30.602 --> 11:32.387
Benny's got more to lose than
anyone if he doesn't testify.

11:32.387 --> 11:34.041
And we got Fugazi
in our pocket.

11:34.041 --> 11:35.738
Where are we
with Maria Garcia?

11:35.738 --> 11:37.000
Still doesn't wanna testify.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.175
So how do we change that?

11:38.175 --> 11:39.655
She can be found in contempt.

11:39.655 --> 11:41.135
Do you really wanna put
a victim

11:41.135 --> 11:42.832
of sexual assault in prison?

11:42.832 --> 11:45.356
Well, all the same,
the threat can't hurt.

11:45.356 --> 11:46.749
What about Sacrilege?

11:46.749 --> 11:48.969
What about him?

11:48.969 --> 11:50.971
Did you get him
to tell us anything?

11:50.971 --> 11:52.668
The kid won't talk.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.714
I mean, I couldn't help
to notice his track marks.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.367
The kid's an addict.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.718
It's been a while
since his last fix.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.936
That ought to hurt.

11:59.936 --> 12:01.416
Well, it was your
techniques that got

12:01.416 --> 12:02.504
us here in the first place.

12:02.504 --> 12:04.332
Me? What did I do?

12:04.332 --> 12:06.638
Those recordings that
we received from Benny

12:06.638 --> 12:09.816
confirm that the hit on Benson
was a direct result of you

12:09.816 --> 12:12.079
putting Ricky and Sabo
in stabbing distance

12:12.079 --> 12:13.994
of 19th Street because
you wanted to flip them.

12:13.994 --> 12:16.039
You almost got my son killed.

12:16.039 --> 12:18.346
Thank you again for that.

12:18.346 --> 12:21.044
Captain, if you want,
I can talk to him.

12:21.044 --> 12:23.003
We're getting very close
to the trial.

12:23.003 --> 12:26.310
I mean, is that worth a shot?

12:26.310 --> 12:28.095
A last-minute
change of conscience

12:28.095 --> 12:29.836
from the only
gang recruiter left alive?

12:29.836 --> 12:31.446
It's down to the wire,
but it can't hurt.

12:31.446 --> 12:33.143
Okay, Velasco.

12:33.143 --> 12:35.755
Take Churlish with you.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.147
Okay.

12:44.589 --> 12:47.505
Hector, Detective Velasco.

12:49.072 --> 12:51.683
She a lawyer?

12:51.683 --> 12:52.728
No.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.599
But where's yours?

12:54.599 --> 12:56.950
I, uh, represent myself.

12:56.950 --> 12:59.604
Bold words for a guy
whose hands are shaking.

12:59.604 --> 13:02.346
That captain of yours left me
in here to sweat it out.

13:02.346 --> 13:04.696
Yeah, he ain't
no captain of ours.

13:04.696 --> 13:07.787
Whoever uses withdrawal as a
weapon hasn't been through it.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.397
You have?

13:11.181 --> 13:13.793
What the hell are you doing?

13:13.793 --> 13:15.142
We're supposed
to be asking questions

13:15.142 --> 13:16.578
and trying to flip him,
but we both know

13:16.578 --> 13:18.275
it's not gonna work
if he's sweating like that.

13:18.275 --> 13:20.669
- Can I talk to you outside?
- No.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.453
Where'd you get that?

13:22.453 --> 13:24.629
Wheel well of that car
your dealers were using.

13:29.156 --> 13:30.766
This has gone too far.

13:30.766 --> 13:32.637
What are you gonna do,
Captain America?

13:32.637 --> 13:34.248
Huh?

13:34.248 --> 13:36.859
You're gonna arrest me, hmm?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.476
She's pretty uptight
for a sister.

13:45.476 --> 13:47.783
Yeah, she grew up
in the suburbs.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.263
You can tell.

14:11.676 --> 14:13.591
I went to my car after work.

14:13.591 --> 14:16.333
Two men were in the back seat,
door open.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.422
They pulled me inside.

14:18.422 --> 14:20.947
They took turns raping me.

14:20.947 --> 14:23.166
When they were done,
they took my underwear.

14:23.166 --> 14:24.515
For what purpose?

14:24.515 --> 14:25.821
To show my brother
what they could do

14:25.821 --> 14:28.041
to the rest of the women
in our family,

14:28.041 --> 14:33.394
our mom or our baby sister,
if he said no.

14:33.394 --> 14:35.875
Were these the two men
who assaulted you?

14:35.875 --> 14:37.224
Yes.

14:37.224 --> 14:38.616
For the record,
Lindsay del Toro,

14:38.616 --> 14:40.531
AKA Bug Bear, is now deceased.

14:40.531 --> 14:43.708
Hector Suarez, street name
Sacrilege, is in Rikers.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.494
Now, you heard testimony
that DNA links both

14:46.494 --> 14:49.845
of these men
to Ms. Garcia's assault.

14:49.845 --> 14:52.717
Ms. Garcia, did you tell
your brother what had happened?

14:52.717 --> 14:53.588
I did.

14:53.588 --> 14:56.460
He told me he had no choice.

14:56.460 --> 14:58.506
That BX9 would target
other women in our family

14:58.506 --> 14:59.942
if he refused to join.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.944
Which is why you withdrew
your initial complaint

15:01.944 --> 15:03.250
to the police.

15:03.250 --> 15:07.428
I was afraid of retaliation
against Rodrigo.

15:07.428 --> 15:08.559
But he was killed.

15:08.559 --> 15:10.300
Two months ago.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.867
By rivals of BX9,

15:11.867 --> 15:14.304
so he doesn't need me
to protect him anymore.

15:14.304 --> 15:16.045
Thank you.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.267
I am--

15:20.267 --> 15:23.270
I am very sorry for what
happened to you, Ms. Garcia.

15:23.270 --> 15:26.055
But haven't the men responsible
for your ordeal

15:26.055 --> 15:27.883
been brought to justice?

15:27.883 --> 15:30.538
One is already dead,
and the other is in jail

15:30.538 --> 15:32.018
awaiting his own trial.

15:32.018 --> 15:34.194
Yes, but they were acting
on Oscar Papa's orders.

15:34.194 --> 15:36.152
Well, do you have
any direct knowledge of that?

15:36.152 --> 15:40.287
Other than what the police
and the DA have told you?

15:40.287 --> 15:41.723
No, but--

15:41.723 --> 15:43.333
Did your brother
implicate my client?

15:43.333 --> 15:44.508
No--

15:44.508 --> 15:45.727
You know Oscar Papa,
don't you,

15:45.727 --> 15:47.294
from around the neighborhood?

15:47.294 --> 15:48.730
Everyone does.

15:48.730 --> 15:51.167
He's a customer sometimes
at my family's restaurant.

15:51.167 --> 15:54.388
You invited two NYPD captains
to that same restaurant

15:54.388 --> 15:55.650
under false pretenses?

15:55.650 --> 15:56.738
I had to do that.

15:56.738 --> 15:57.782
I was afraid that--

15:57.782 --> 16:00.350
Of my clients or the police?

16:00.350 --> 16:01.743
Both.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.136
But you did lie
to the police.

16:03.136 --> 16:05.355
Well, did that motivate
your decision to testify?

16:05.355 --> 16:06.356
Objection.

16:06.356 --> 16:07.879
Withdrawn.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.055
Nothing further.

16:14.886 --> 16:16.671
Captain Duarte,
can you explain what this is

16:16.671 --> 16:17.933
to the jury, please?

16:17.933 --> 16:19.979
A recruitment tool for BX9--

16:19.979 --> 16:23.591
undergarments of rape victims,
mothers and sisters,

16:23.591 --> 16:26.463
hung from a tree to intimidate
vulnerable teens

16:26.463 --> 16:28.683
into signing up
as principiantes.

16:28.683 --> 16:30.598
<i>Principiantes?</i>

16:30.598 --> 16:32.600
That's what they call
new recruits at BX9.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.775
And how many women
were you able

16:33.775 --> 16:35.559
to associate with rape cases?

16:35.559 --> 16:37.822
Through DNA
and victim IDs, about 90.

16:37.822 --> 16:39.694
And what did your
investigations conclude?

16:39.694 --> 16:42.088
Two mid-level recruiters,
Sacrilege and Bug Bear

16:42.088 --> 16:44.046
of the Tremont clique,
were responsible

16:44.046 --> 16:44.960
for most of the rapes.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.789
Now, do mid-level recruiters

16:47.789 --> 16:50.618
for BX9 usually act
independently?

16:50.618 --> 16:52.446
In my experience, no.

16:52.446 --> 16:55.188
BX9 is a hierarchical organization.

16:55.188 --> 16:57.103
There are multiple levels
of the command chain.

16:57.103 --> 16:59.540
And how do gang members
usually move up the ranks?

16:59.540 --> 17:01.150
Through committing
acts of violence,

17:01.150 --> 17:04.066
including rape and murder at
the behest of their superiors.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.677
Does anything happen without
the knowledge of the head

17:06.677 --> 17:07.765
of the organization?

17:07.765 --> 17:09.245
No, it does not.

17:09.245 --> 17:12.553
Orders of violence only spill
down from the leadership

17:12.553 --> 17:14.468
to the soldiers
and the principiantes.

17:14.468 --> 17:16.905
And in your
ongoing investigations

17:16.905 --> 17:19.951
into the BX9 leadership,
who did you focus on?

17:19.951 --> 17:23.129
That man right there,
Oscar Papa.

17:23.129 --> 17:25.914
Thank you, Captain.

17:25.914 --> 17:28.438
Captain Duarte,
you investigated

17:28.438 --> 17:30.832
BX9 for five years.

17:30.832 --> 17:32.312
Is that fair to say?

17:32.312 --> 17:33.574
Yes, that sounds about right.

17:33.574 --> 17:34.879
Well, isn't it
also fair to say

17:34.879 --> 17:37.099
that you have a personal
vendetta against BX9?

17:37.099 --> 17:39.232
A vendetta, no.
I'm just doing my job.

17:39.232 --> 17:42.583
But you--you did own
a vintage Mustang?

17:42.583 --> 17:44.193
- Yes.
- What happened to it?

17:44.193 --> 17:47.718
Two BX9 gang members followed
me home and set it on fire.

17:47.718 --> 17:49.155
And that made you
pretty angry, didn't it?

17:49.155 --> 17:50.721
What do you think?

17:50.721 --> 17:53.028
Well, angry enough to push
one of the boys off a roof?

17:53.028 --> 17:54.856
Objection.
As Counselor Swope knows,

17:54.856 --> 17:56.423
Sleep's death
was ruled an accident.

17:56.423 --> 17:57.946
Sustained.

17:57.946 --> 18:01.776
But one of your colleagues,
Captain Olivia Benson,

18:01.776 --> 18:04.953
accused you of pushing
the boy, didn't she?

18:04.953 --> 18:06.346
It was a misunderstanding.

18:06.346 --> 18:08.609
Well, is it true that
you've had a few of those

18:08.609 --> 18:10.219
involving BX9 members?

18:12.482 --> 18:14.267
Do you recognize
these two boys?

18:16.791 --> 18:20.534
Sabo and Pretty Ricky,
two former principiantes

18:20.534 --> 18:21.883
of the Tremont clique.

18:21.883 --> 18:24.146
They're deceased now,
aren't they?

18:24.146 --> 18:26.192
Stabbed in prison
by rivals you requested

18:26.192 --> 18:30.065
they be put in close proximity
to in an effort to flip them.

18:30.065 --> 18:32.415
Now, was Captain Benson aware
that this decision

18:32.415 --> 18:35.375
made her and her son a target?

18:35.375 --> 18:36.898
She is now.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.856
A lie of omission,
just another one

18:38.856 --> 18:41.163
of your misunderstandings?

18:41.163 --> 18:42.686
Objection, immaterial.

18:42.686 --> 18:44.645
Move it along.

18:44.645 --> 18:46.037
You're Mexican, right?

18:46.037 --> 18:47.952
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

18:47.952 --> 18:50.085
Well, in your experience,
have you found

18:50.085 --> 18:54.002
that Mexicans are prejudiced
against Salvadorans?

18:54.002 --> 18:56.570
Humans are territorial,
just like every other animal

18:56.570 --> 18:57.788
on this planet.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.964
Are you territorial?

18:59.964 --> 19:01.966
Well, I'm human, aren't I?

19:01.966 --> 19:07.189
But I'm not prejudiced against
Salvadorans, only BX9.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.583
They ruined the neighborhood
I grew up in.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.019
Before they came along,

19:11.019 --> 19:14.370
people could walk their dogs
at night.

19:14.370 --> 19:17.852
Kids didn't have to worry
about their mothers' dignity,

19:17.852 --> 19:20.202
being hung from a tree
as some sort

19:20.202 --> 19:25.512
of a sick advertisement for
a life they didn't even want.

19:25.512 --> 19:28.471
Well, it sounds to me
that you do have a vendetta

19:28.471 --> 19:30.038
against my client, Captain.

19:30.038 --> 19:32.432
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

19:39.482 --> 19:41.136
Yeah, pulled two Jane Does

19:41.136 --> 19:43.356
out of here
in the past few years.

19:43.356 --> 19:44.661
You run their DNA?

19:44.661 --> 19:46.141
Yeah, nothing in the system.

19:46.141 --> 19:48.187
Showed their photos around
Hunts Point, but nah,

19:48.187 --> 19:50.276
no one wanted to talk.
- So where are their bodies?

19:50.276 --> 19:51.973
Buried on Hart Island.

19:51.973 --> 19:53.801
What'd the M.E. say?

19:53.801 --> 19:57.021
Both OD'd,
massive dose of opioids.

19:57.021 --> 19:58.588
Any sign of sexual assault?

19:58.588 --> 19:59.763
We're Homicide.

19:59.763 --> 20:01.025
It's not like
we ran a rape kit.

20:01.025 --> 20:02.636
If M.E. found something,
that was Bronx SVU.

20:02.636 --> 20:04.290
That was their job.

20:04.290 --> 20:07.249
You know better than anyone
what really happened there.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.469
All too well.

20:09.469 --> 20:10.774
Yeah, thank you, man.

20:10.774 --> 20:12.733
See you fellas.

20:12.733 --> 20:14.430
I think we're looking
at a serial.

20:14.430 --> 20:15.779
It'd be tough to prove,

20:15.779 --> 20:17.303
unless we find that source
of Wildnil.

20:17.303 --> 20:19.435
We may get lucky with the
online complaint system.

20:19.435 --> 20:22.656
Cross-reference doctors,
dentists, pharmacists.

20:22.656 --> 20:24.484
And veterinarians, right?

20:24.484 --> 20:26.442
I don't know of too many
other kinds of doctors

20:26.442 --> 20:28.836
who shoot their patients
with a dart to put them out.

20:28.836 --> 20:31.491
So much for your retirement,
huh, Bruno?

20:31.491 --> 20:32.709
Yep.

20:35.146 --> 20:38.454
I know I'm not supposed
to have Misty here.

20:38.454 --> 20:40.543
But she's gentle, quiet.

20:40.543 --> 20:43.242
We're not here to confiscate
your dog, Ms. Morgan.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.940
Two years ago,
you filed a complaint

20:45.940 --> 20:47.985
against your veterinarian?

20:49.422 --> 20:51.902
Dr. Tim. That pervert.

20:51.902 --> 20:55.123
Can you tell us why
you filed that complaint?

20:55.123 --> 20:58.169
I didn't have money
to pay Misty's bill.

20:58.169 --> 21:01.999
Dr. Tim said we could
work something out.

21:01.999 --> 21:03.479
And what did he mean by that?

21:05.351 --> 21:07.831
He tried to get me
to touch it.

21:07.831 --> 21:09.311
Touch what?

21:09.311 --> 21:10.878
What do you think?

21:10.878 --> 21:13.707
His member, his tool, his wang!

21:13.707 --> 21:16.797
Okay, we get it.

21:16.797 --> 21:18.886
Okay, so what happened?

21:18.886 --> 21:22.324
I'm old, but I'm no idiot.

21:22.324 --> 21:23.760
I touched it.

21:25.588 --> 21:27.851
But I didn't like it.

21:34.815 --> 21:36.773
You licking your wounds?

21:36.773 --> 21:38.558
Yeah.

21:38.558 --> 21:40.734
Why? Should I stop so you can
pour some salt in them?

21:40.734 --> 21:44.520
Hey, you did your best.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.261
Which, let's face it,

21:46.261 --> 21:49.177
might not have been
good enough.

21:49.177 --> 21:52.223
If Oscar Papa gets off--
- Don't even say that.

21:52.223 --> 21:54.791
This is not over.
We have a solid case.

22:02.408 --> 22:03.974
Captain Benson.

22:10.764 --> 22:13.027
Velasco,
what the hell happened?

22:13.027 --> 22:15.159
UNI says Benny's mom
sent him a plate of food.

22:15.159 --> 22:17.074
He took a few bites,
and he started bleeding.

22:17.074 --> 22:19.294
- Rat poison.
- For a rat.

22:19.294 --> 22:22.079
Oh, my God.

22:22.079 --> 22:24.430
Is it possible that
they got to his mother?

22:24.430 --> 22:26.910
Either that or the kid
who delivered it.

22:31.132 --> 22:32.960
What are the chances
Benny makes it?

22:32.960 --> 22:36.529
Well, if it doesn't,
Oscar Papa walks free.

22:43.753 --> 22:46.277
- Benny Barros is dead, huh?
- Died in the ambulance.

22:46.277 --> 22:47.627
Yeah, which puts our case
on life support

22:47.627 --> 22:48.628
because Benny's tapes
are no longer admissible.

22:48.628 --> 22:50.412
We know BX9 is behind this,

22:50.412 --> 22:51.848
which means Oscar Papa
gave the order.

22:51.848 --> 22:54.242
No kidding.
So what are you doing about it?

22:54.242 --> 22:55.548
My detectives
are all over it,

22:55.548 --> 22:58.159
working BX9's girlfriends'
contacts.

22:58.159 --> 22:59.334
What about Sacrilege?

22:59.334 --> 23:00.466
You get anything?

23:00.466 --> 23:01.641
I got the kid on the hook.

23:01.641 --> 23:04.339
That's one word for it.

23:04.339 --> 23:05.340
What does that mean?

23:05.340 --> 23:06.863
Nothing.

23:08.474 --> 23:09.779
All right,
I'll talk to the DA.

23:09.779 --> 23:11.346
I'll see if I can't
sweeten his plea deal.

23:11.346 --> 23:13.174
For 100 rapes?
You gonna tell Benson?

23:13.174 --> 23:15.437
Hey, we're past that.

23:15.437 --> 23:16.917
Don't you get it?

23:16.917 --> 23:18.788
We need to start playing dirty,
just like Oscar Papa.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.706
Copy that.

23:28.885 --> 23:31.801
He's been running a fever.

23:31.801 --> 23:33.020
I'm gonna send
the nurse back over,

23:33.020 --> 23:35.718
but if he gets any worse,

23:35.718 --> 23:37.328
you have to take him
to the hospital.

23:37.328 --> 23:38.373
No.

23:38.373 --> 23:39.940
No, I'm fine.

23:39.940 --> 23:42.725
Albert, how are you doing, truthfully?

23:42.725 --> 23:43.857
Huh?

23:43.857 --> 23:45.728
Why are there
more cops around?

23:49.863 --> 23:53.127
Benny Barros was
killed last night.

23:53.127 --> 23:55.346
I thought he was
in witness protection.

23:55.346 --> 23:56.478
He was.

23:56.478 --> 23:57.610
Just like us.

23:57.610 --> 23:59.568
I just want my son
to be safe.

23:59.568 --> 24:01.483
Believe me, so do I.

24:01.483 --> 24:04.094
I don't know why
I ever trusted you.

24:04.094 --> 24:05.748
I'll never be able to walk
down the street

24:05.748 --> 24:09.317
without looking
over my shoulder again.

24:09.317 --> 24:12.189
You should have just ended
my life while you could.

24:12.189 --> 24:13.321
Don't say that, Albert.

24:13.321 --> 24:14.975
My son is not testifying.

24:14.975 --> 24:16.063
Mrs. Diaz,
let's think about this.

24:16.063 --> 24:18.457
No!

24:18.457 --> 24:21.024
Get out. Get out of our lives.

24:32.906 --> 24:36.910
Captain Benson, you are
a sorbet for the eyes.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.346
Hey, you wanted
to talk, talk.

24:38.346 --> 24:40.435
Well, we both know that
your lead witness is dead.

24:40.435 --> 24:43.090
Yeah, a pupusa
full of rat poison.

24:43.090 --> 24:45.571
You know, BX9 should
publish a cookbook.

24:45.571 --> 24:47.486
We'll be filing
a motion to dismiss

24:47.486 --> 24:49.705
unless the DA has an offer.

24:49.705 --> 24:51.751
Well, your client
pleads guilty

24:51.751 --> 24:54.449
to 19 charges of rape,
2 counts of attempted murder.

24:54.449 --> 24:55.581
We'll think about it.

24:55.581 --> 24:58.279
You do that,
but Benny may be dead,

24:58.279 --> 24:59.628
but those recordings he gave us

24:59.628 --> 25:02.588
have your client
running his mouth

25:02.588 --> 25:04.111
about half the gangs
in the city.

25:04.111 --> 25:05.939
Now, I might not be able
to use that in court--

25:05.939 --> 25:09.595
But they would make
a great mixtape

25:09.595 --> 25:12.119
for all the bangers in here.

25:12.119 --> 25:14.077
Are you threatening me?

25:14.077 --> 25:16.340
That's not a threat.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.821
It's a verdict.

25:18.821 --> 25:24.044
No one gets away
with trying to kill my son,

25:24.044 --> 25:26.350
not without some form
of justice.

25:26.350 --> 25:28.048
And right now...

25:29.832 --> 25:35.142
Yours is starting
to sound pretty good.

25:35.142 --> 25:38.232
You know the rule--

25:38.232 --> 25:40.147
blood for blood.

25:47.067 --> 25:50.287
Now, take your time,
Ms. Sipes.

25:52.072 --> 25:53.334
That's him.

25:53.334 --> 25:54.553
You sure?

25:54.553 --> 25:55.597
Yeah.

25:55.597 --> 25:58.165
I remember the eyes.

25:58.165 --> 25:59.558
Who the hell is he?

25:59.558 --> 26:03.213
Dr. Tim Birch,
a veterinarian.

26:03.213 --> 26:05.302
We think he's good
for the murders

26:05.302 --> 26:07.261
of a few other prostitutes
in the area.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.700
Why would he do that?

26:14.050 --> 26:16.096
He could have just paid
like the rest of the johns

26:16.096 --> 26:17.619
up at Hunts Point.

26:22.798 --> 26:25.975
Vets are supposed to
take care of animals.

26:25.975 --> 26:27.629
Yeah.

26:27.629 --> 26:29.152
Well, he is one.

26:32.721 --> 26:34.549
The judge won't grant
a motion to dismiss,

26:34.549 --> 26:36.899
but if Fugazi doesn't testify,

26:36.899 --> 26:38.640
then I have no way to prove
that Oscar Papa

26:38.640 --> 26:41.382
ordered that hit
on you and Noah.

26:41.382 --> 26:44.080
The UNIs assigned to Fugazi
and his mother--

26:46.256 --> 26:49.042
They just rushed him
to the hospital.

26:49.042 --> 26:50.870
Not another
poisoned pupusa, is it?

26:50.870 --> 26:55.091
Nope.
This time, it's my fault.

26:58.399 --> 26:59.966
<i>They said
I'm gonna lose my leg.</i>

26:59.966 --> 27:01.837
We're getting you
the best doctors, okay?

27:01.837 --> 27:03.360
- I'm afraid.
- I know, honey.

27:03.360 --> 27:04.361
I know.
- Where's my mom?

27:04.361 --> 27:05.536
She's just upstairs.

27:05.536 --> 27:06.755
She's filling out
some paperwork.

27:06.755 --> 27:08.061
I'm sorry.
We have to take him in now.

27:08.061 --> 27:10.193
She's gonna be with you
the whole time, okay?

27:17.548 --> 27:19.463
I'm running out of witnesses.

27:19.463 --> 27:21.683
Upside is,
I might be home early.

27:21.683 --> 27:23.685
I love you too.

27:23.685 --> 27:25.644
Hey.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.036
You look like you could use
a cup of coffee.

27:27.036 --> 27:28.559
Come in, come in.

27:28.559 --> 27:31.780
Been at the hospital
all night with the Diazes.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.869
The doctors manage
to save Fugazi's leg?

27:33.869 --> 27:38.047
Oh, man, this kid is gonna be
out of commission for months.

27:38.047 --> 27:39.353
Wouldn't be the first time

27:39.353 --> 27:40.702
I had somebody testify
from a hospital bed.

27:40.702 --> 27:44.227
Be that as it may,
the mother is not budging.

27:44.227 --> 27:46.403
I'm not a miracle worker.

27:46.403 --> 27:50.930
I mean, I got a 48-hour
continuance after Benny,

27:50.930 --> 27:54.585
but I gotta put somebody
on that stand tomorrow.

27:54.585 --> 27:55.848
Thank you.

27:57.632 --> 28:00.504
How's Noah doing?

28:00.504 --> 28:02.724
He's fine. He's good.
He's safe.

28:02.724 --> 28:05.771
You know, Woodstock PD's
got unmarked cars

28:05.771 --> 28:07.294
on the McCanns' block, but--

28:07.294 --> 28:09.078
I see what you did there, Counselor.

28:09.078 --> 28:11.690
Me? What'd I do?

28:11.690 --> 28:14.605
Brought up Noah
to remind me which kid

28:14.605 --> 28:17.260
I should really
be thinking about.

28:17.260 --> 28:20.002
I plead the fifth.

28:20.002 --> 28:21.308
Thanks for not
telling Benson.

28:21.308 --> 28:23.005
About what?

28:23.005 --> 28:24.093
Those drugs that
we confiscated

28:24.093 --> 28:26.139
from these bangers.

28:26.139 --> 28:27.618
You know it was
all theater, right?

28:27.618 --> 28:29.925
The guy was a junkie.
He was sweating.

28:29.925 --> 28:32.623
I just dangled some of his
product in front of him.

28:32.623 --> 28:34.930
You didn't give him any?
Because that would be illegal.

28:34.930 --> 28:36.715
Oh, of course not.

28:39.152 --> 28:40.588
You know I'm just
a white shield,

28:40.588 --> 28:42.459
but I have a whole future
to worry about.

28:42.459 --> 28:44.766
I get it.
You got your sights set on 1PP.

28:44.766 --> 28:46.594
Don't laugh.

28:46.594 --> 28:47.943
Look, if you wanna keep
your nose clean so you can be

28:47.943 --> 28:50.729
the next Black female
commissioner or whatever,

28:50.729 --> 28:51.947
that's on you.

28:51.947 --> 28:53.470
But my job right now
is to flip a bishop

28:53.470 --> 28:54.863
to take down the king.

28:54.863 --> 28:56.691
Okay, and you heard Carisi.
We gotta play dirty.

28:56.691 --> 28:59.476
If push comes to shove,
I'm never gonna lie for you.

28:59.476 --> 29:02.131
No one's asking you to.

29:12.011 --> 29:13.708
What's up, homey?

29:16.450 --> 29:17.581
What, no care package?

29:17.581 --> 29:19.322
We're cops, not dealers.

29:19.322 --> 29:21.542
Yo, nobody's
talking to you, bicha.

29:23.587 --> 29:25.198
I'm only interested
in my friend here.

29:38.951 --> 29:40.300
What did he say?

29:40.300 --> 29:42.171
It's a waste of time.

29:42.171 --> 29:45.000
He's being vulgar.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.393
About me?

29:49.135 --> 29:51.702
So what do you say, bicha?
Huh?

29:51.702 --> 29:55.228
How about I, uh, show you
the rest of my tattoos?

29:57.839 --> 30:00.407
You know what, Churlish?
Why don't you give us a minute?

30:04.019 --> 30:04.933
Knock yourself out.

30:18.425 --> 30:20.819
Never good to drink alone.

30:20.819 --> 30:24.387
Well, it beats sleeping
in my house that way.

30:24.387 --> 30:26.259
Is that an invitation?

30:26.259 --> 30:28.696
You wish.

30:28.696 --> 30:30.654
I was talking about my kid.

30:32.091 --> 30:33.657
What she's having.

30:33.657 --> 30:37.270
Oh, that's defeat
on the rocks.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.273
Actually,
I'll have a bourbon.

30:41.927 --> 30:46.757
So Carisi is going
to subpoena Fugazi.

30:46.757 --> 30:47.802
What, you didn't
crack him in the head

30:47.802 --> 30:49.891
with that bleeding heart
of yours?

30:49.891 --> 30:51.675
It's all out of blood.

30:54.461 --> 30:56.898
Oscar Papa will do that
to you.

30:56.898 --> 30:58.944
Guy's like a bed bug.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.251
You know,
I finally understand

31:02.251 --> 31:06.473
why you are the way you are.

31:09.693 --> 31:12.348
He's ruined
hundreds of lives.

31:12.348 --> 31:15.525
Not to mention
taking me away from my son.

31:17.919 --> 31:21.270
He's never looked so happy.

31:21.270 --> 31:24.273
They look really--

31:24.273 --> 31:25.405
normal.

31:25.405 --> 31:27.842
Yeah, they do.

31:31.541 --> 31:38.418
So I hate to say it,
but you were right.

31:38.418 --> 31:42.204
We should have
gone after Oscar Papa

31:42.204 --> 31:43.902
right after the subway case.

31:43.902 --> 31:47.035
Does that mean you're sorry
for reducing my five-year

31:47.035 --> 31:48.950
whale hunt for one
of the biggest scourges

31:48.950 --> 31:52.040
this city's ever seen
into a simple rape case?

31:52.040 --> 31:53.912
Don't push it.

31:55.174 --> 31:56.349
No.

31:58.873 --> 32:02.572
If that's as close
as I'll get tonight,

32:02.572 --> 32:04.531
I'll sleep a happy man.

32:10.363 --> 32:12.713
Thank you.
You didn't have to do that.

32:12.713 --> 32:16.151
What, picking up the check?

32:16.151 --> 32:17.761
What can I say?

32:17.761 --> 32:19.894
Ever since you got jumped,
I've been racking the overtime.

32:21.591 --> 32:24.420
Are you sure that
we can't drop you somewhere?

32:24.420 --> 32:26.118
No, thank you.
I think I'm gonna walk.

32:26.118 --> 32:30.600
Okay. Good night, Mike.

32:30.600 --> 32:31.950
Good night, Captain.

32:47.356 --> 32:48.575
Help you?

32:48.575 --> 32:51.578
Can I get a pack
of Reds, please?

33:04.547 --> 33:05.940
Get on the ground.

33:05.940 --> 33:07.159
Call 911.

33:07.159 --> 33:09.204
Tell them it's a police
officer involved.

33:09.204 --> 33:11.424
Do it.

33:11.424 --> 33:12.468
Ahh!

33:29.050 --> 33:30.399
You okay, Liv?

33:30.399 --> 33:31.748
How is he?

33:31.748 --> 33:33.489
Still in surgery.

33:33.489 --> 33:34.795
The doctors say
he lost a lot of blood.

33:34.795 --> 33:36.188
Oh, my God.

33:36.188 --> 33:38.146
Every unit in the city
is on the scene canvassing,

33:38.146 --> 33:39.582
pulling traffic cams.

33:39.582 --> 33:41.106
Bodega cameras caught
the whole attack.

33:41.106 --> 33:42.455
We're running
facial recognition.

33:42.455 --> 33:44.239
We're gonna get these guys.

33:44.239 --> 33:46.937
That's my boy Manny
from Bronx Gangs.

33:46.937 --> 33:49.723
Velasco's on the scene.
Muncy came in on her day off.

33:49.723 --> 33:53.161
I can't believe this,
but I was just with him.

33:53.161 --> 33:56.034
It's not over, Liv.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.079
We did catch a serial.

33:58.079 --> 33:59.776
Picked him up off vic ID.

33:59.776 --> 34:02.518
DNA linked him to the rape kit.

34:02.518 --> 34:05.130
And I'm really impressed
with Moneybags.

34:05.130 --> 34:06.783
This guy is driven.
He's on a mission.

34:06.783 --> 34:09.743
And I was thinking,
now that Rollins is gone,

34:09.743 --> 34:12.180
we could use another body.
- No, I just--

34:12.180 --> 34:14.965
I was too hard on Duarte.

34:14.965 --> 34:16.924
He's a good cop, Fin.

34:16.924 --> 34:18.534
We all know that.

34:34.811 --> 34:38.641
Bobby Santos,
Jose Cruz, Carlos Lopez--

34:38.641 --> 34:39.816
you recognize them?

34:39.816 --> 34:41.340
You should.

34:41.340 --> 34:44.038
They're three of the
five principiantes

34:44.038 --> 34:46.519
that you ordered
to kill Captain Duarte,

34:46.519 --> 34:48.173
and they're willing to testify.

34:48.173 --> 34:49.435
Testify to what?

34:49.435 --> 34:51.698
Well, unlike Fugazi,
they say that

34:51.698 --> 34:54.918
they got their orders to kill
Duarte from a prison call.

34:54.918 --> 34:56.703
Which are all recorded.

34:56.703 --> 34:58.139
You had to know that.

34:58.139 --> 34:59.706
I'm not denying anything, Captain.

34:59.706 --> 35:01.011
You got me dead to rights.

35:01.011 --> 35:02.491
I need to confer
with my client.

35:02.491 --> 35:04.058
No, you don't.

35:04.058 --> 35:05.190
Sit down.

35:09.194 --> 35:10.630
We're listening.

35:10.630 --> 35:13.241
I just wanted to say

35:13.241 --> 35:17.158
I know how much
you respected Captain Duarte.

35:17.158 --> 35:18.942
And that's why
you killed him?

35:18.942 --> 35:21.162
You know the rule.

35:21.162 --> 35:23.295
Blood for blood.

35:23.295 --> 35:28.343
He wanted to take away
everything I've built.

35:28.343 --> 35:30.519
I couldn't allow that
to happen.

35:34.393 --> 35:39.006
You knew that you could run
your organization from here.

35:39.006 --> 35:42.096
Most of my crew is in here.

35:42.096 --> 35:45.578
And like I said,
you can't kill an idea.

35:48.189 --> 35:50.844
So you knew exactly
what you were doing

35:50.844 --> 35:52.672
when you made that call.

35:54.369 --> 35:58.895
The question is, why?

35:58.895 --> 36:01.550
The truth?

36:01.550 --> 36:05.989
I got a soft spot
for you, Captain.

36:05.989 --> 36:07.687
I see the way you look at me.

36:07.687 --> 36:10.342
Most women say they
would kill for their kid,

36:10.342 --> 36:13.214
but not a lot of them
would go toe to toe

36:13.214 --> 36:15.303
with a guy like me for them.

36:17.262 --> 36:21.614
You are a better mother
than I've ever had.

36:21.614 --> 36:24.704
We can talk about
your childhood later.

36:24.704 --> 36:27.315
What I need to know is,
is your client going

36:27.315 --> 36:28.795
to plead guilty to murder?

36:33.887 --> 36:34.801
But not the rapes.

36:41.242 --> 36:42.374
Hang on.

36:49.163 --> 36:54.255
I need you to assure me

36:54.255 --> 36:57.215
that my son is safe.

37:03.177 --> 37:04.918
He won't be harmed.

37:06.920 --> 37:09.966
I got what I wanted.

37:09.966 --> 37:14.101
So we're even now.

37:21.195 --> 37:23.415
25 years for the
attempted murder on you.

37:23.415 --> 37:25.895
25 to life for Duarte.

37:25.895 --> 37:29.986
He'll be eligible
for parole around 2096.

37:29.986 --> 37:31.727
And the five principiantes?

37:31.727 --> 37:35.296
We're gonna
go after them all.

37:35.296 --> 37:38.168
Noah headed home?
- He is.

37:38.168 --> 37:40.170
Stabler's driving him down.

37:40.170 --> 37:42.085
And I'm going to
meet them at home.

37:42.085 --> 37:45.437
I didn't wanna drive
after the day that we've had.

37:45.437 --> 37:48.440
There's nobody that I trust
more to bring my son home

37:48.440 --> 37:51.269
in one piece than Stabler.

37:53.488 --> 37:54.750
I'll give Amanda your love.

37:54.750 --> 37:56.274
Please do.

38:01.191 --> 38:04.630
Officer Churlish, you're
a long way from the Bronx.

38:04.630 --> 38:07.850
I have something
I wanted to give you.

38:07.850 --> 38:09.374
Okay.

38:09.374 --> 38:11.550
I left my phone on
when Detective Velasco

38:11.550 --> 38:13.682
was talking to that recruiter.

38:13.682 --> 38:17.338
Aside from it being a felony,

38:17.338 --> 38:19.862
why would you do that?

38:19.862 --> 38:22.082
You'll see
when you listen to it.

38:35.269 --> 38:38.838
He's out like a light.

38:38.838 --> 38:41.231
- He's had a hard week.
- Yeah.

38:41.231 --> 38:43.538
So did you.

38:43.538 --> 38:45.671
Thank you, Elliot.

38:47.194 --> 38:49.065
Thank you for picking him up.

38:49.065 --> 38:51.503
You're family.

38:51.503 --> 38:53.635
What are you looking for?

38:53.635 --> 38:54.723
Sugar?

38:54.723 --> 38:56.377
It's here.

38:56.377 --> 38:58.510
I have some here somewhere.

39:03.166 --> 39:04.777
Why didn't you call me?

39:07.910 --> 39:11.784
Because I knew that
you would try to protect me.

39:13.438 --> 39:15.614
And there's something
wrong with that?

39:21.141 --> 39:22.969
I care for you.

39:29.976 --> 39:31.891
Liv, look at me.

39:36.156 --> 39:37.810
Here it is.

39:44.164 --> 39:45.774
Liv.

39:48.298 --> 39:50.257
Elliot.

39:50.257 --> 39:52.520
Elliot, I want to.

39:52.520 --> 39:55.915
I want to, but I can't.

39:55.915 --> 39:58.526
Why not?

39:58.526 --> 40:01.616
Because what if
it doesn't work out?

40:04.837 --> 40:06.665
And what if things work out?

40:08.797 --> 40:11.017
Elliot, I'm not ready
for this.

40:13.062 --> 40:15.064
I'm not ready for this.

40:19.634 --> 40:22.289
I'm not ready for this.
