**

00:08.967 --> 00:10.427
Yo!

00:10.468 --> 00:12.804
It's that time, guys.
Night three of the battles.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.264
Team Niall!

00:14.305 --> 00:16.641
I cannot wait to get
these battles going, baby.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.184
Man: Alright, folks,
have a seat, please.

00:18.226 --> 00:19.686
Let's clear the aisles.
Watch your step.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.688
John: All the coaches are
so impressed with our teams.

00:21.730 --> 00:22.897
One minute.
One minute.

00:22.939 --> 00:24.190
Nobody deserves to go home.

00:24.232 --> 00:25.275
How you doing?

00:25.316 --> 00:27.027
These match-ups are insane.

00:27.068 --> 00:28.361
Bananas.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.447
These pairings are
going to blow your mind.

00:31.531 --> 00:33.533
* Whoa, oh, ohhhh *

00:33.575 --> 00:36.286
Wow!
Oh, my gosh!
That was so good!

00:36.327 --> 00:38.663
Beating his chair up.
That's how good it was.

00:38.705 --> 00:39.914
You better bring it.

00:39.956 --> 00:41.624
Gwen: This is my seventh season
on the show,

00:41.666 --> 00:44.210
and almost every single
performance has blown me away.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.754
John: Holy crap.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.714
It's making for some really,
really tough decisions.

00:47.756 --> 00:51.051
I'm really hoping someone
comes up with a steal here.

00:51.092 --> 00:52.969
Daly: That's the sound
of a steal!

00:53.011 --> 00:56.389
I love to entertain,
but I love to beentertained.

00:56.431 --> 00:58.224
I'm so stoked to see
what happens next.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.143
Fingers are crossed.
Here we go!

01:00.185 --> 01:02.228
Let's go.
Here we go.

01:03.355 --> 01:06.232
Kelly: Next Team Niall
battle pairing.

01:06.274 --> 01:08.735
Nini Iris...

01:08.777 --> 01:12.322
you will be battling
Sophia Hoffman.

01:12.364 --> 01:15.408
[ Cheers and applause ]

01:15.450 --> 01:16.826
It's just such
a great feeling,

01:16.868 --> 01:18.620
knowing, like, we're both
going to kick butt.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.246
We are so meant to be.
Yeah.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.748
It definitely worries me
a little bit

01:21.790 --> 01:23.124
that I'm going
against someone

01:23.166 --> 01:24.876
who has gotten
a four-chair turn.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.462
* I see red *

01:27.504 --> 01:29.422
The blind audition was insane.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.508
* Ohhh, red *

01:31.549 --> 01:33.009
I'm trying to concentrate
on singing,

01:33.051 --> 01:35.387
and then these four beautiful
people are sitting here,

01:35.428 --> 01:36.971
like, staring at me.

01:37.013 --> 01:39.683
Like, no, don't.
[ Laughs ]

01:39.724 --> 01:41.685
I think we're looking at
a potential winner here.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.937
Niall is such
a good storyteller,

01:43.978 --> 01:45.438
and I'm a songwriter myself,

01:45.480 --> 01:48.233
so I feel like I made
the best choice

01:48.274 --> 01:50.694
to pick Niall as my coach.

01:50.735 --> 01:53.488
Just reminding you,
Niall's right here.
Yeah. Yeah.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.115
We're going to sing
in front of him.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.117
We got this.
Come on.

01:57.158 --> 01:58.618
I got you!
Ay!

01:58.660 --> 01:59.619
I got you.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.579
Oh, we're good to go.
Okay, slick.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.415
Bye, babe.

02:03.456 --> 02:05.041
Okay, give me your hand.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.292
Okay.
Wait, he's right here.

02:06.334 --> 02:09.504
Hello!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

02:09.546 --> 02:14.259
Walking in and seeing Niall
was truly amazing.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.719
How's it going?
Hi!

02:15.760 --> 02:18.221
He's literally coaching me
through this journey.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.223
My heart felt, like,
really warm,

02:20.265 --> 02:22.308
that, like,
dreams do come true.

02:22.350 --> 02:24.310
We're back.
We are.
We're back, baby.

02:24.352 --> 02:27.731
Sophia, you're back
in a big way.

02:27.772 --> 02:28.732
Yes, sir.

02:28.773 --> 02:31.192
Last time
didn't go so well.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.902
No. [ Laughs ]
And then look at you now.

02:32.944 --> 02:35.697
Last season, my outcome was
a no-chair turn.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.907
But this season,
I put the work in,

02:37.949 --> 02:41.911
so when I saw boom, boom...

02:41.953 --> 02:44.122
I was like,
"Oh, my God, I did it."

02:44.164 --> 02:47.834
* Tell me you love me *

02:47.876 --> 02:50.587
* I need someone *

02:50.628 --> 02:53.340
When I was finished,
I, like...

02:53.381 --> 02:54.674
I had, like, a moment

02:54.716 --> 02:56.634
because I was
so proud of myself.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.055
It wasn't my time last time,
but it is now.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.348
Yeah, that all makes sense.

03:01.389 --> 03:02.849
That's the biggest lesson
for anyone.

03:02.891 --> 03:05.518
You never learn anything
from success.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.854
Ever.
That's so real.

03:07.896 --> 03:12.108
My whole life story revolves
around that one sentence.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.069
Success isn't how you learn.

03:14.110 --> 03:18.031
I've been navigating what
it's like to handle rejection,

03:18.073 --> 03:22.202
and part of who I am is I love
working out, bodybuilding.

03:22.243 --> 03:24.287
Like, I love going to the gym.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.663
And this second opportunity,

03:25.705 --> 03:27.290
it's almost like, yes,
building your body,

03:27.332 --> 03:29.501
but also building
the artist I want to become.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.628
I get to rebuild
who I want to be.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.713
So, with him saying those words,

03:33.755 --> 03:36.424
it was almost like solidifying,
like, you're on the right track.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.843
And that meant
a whole lot to me.

03:38.885 --> 03:42.097
This song, it's all about,
like, energy and dynamics.

03:42.138 --> 03:44.349
But I think this is what's
so nice about this version

03:44.391 --> 03:46.142
is it gives you
the opportunity

03:46.184 --> 03:47.727
to show a different side
of your voice.
Yeah, yeah,
yeah.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.897
And it felt like
the right thing for both of you.

03:50.939 --> 03:54.818
* Once I had a love,
and it was a gas *

03:54.859 --> 03:58.988
* He soon turned out,
had a heart of glass *
Whoo!

03:59.030 --> 04:00.573
Niall: "Heart of Glass"
by Blondie --

04:00.615 --> 04:01.908
This is the perfect song
for them

04:01.950 --> 04:04.536
because these two have
two huge voices,

04:04.577 --> 04:06.371
so much character,
so much individuality.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.914
* ...behind *

04:07.956 --> 04:10.458
I love Sophia this afternoon.
She was so good.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.085
She was being herself
in a song

04:12.127 --> 04:13.795
that's not necessarily
in her wheelhouse,

04:13.837 --> 04:15.839
but requires
a powerful singer.

04:15.880 --> 04:19.718
* Mucho mistrust,
love's gone behind *

04:19.759 --> 04:22.303
Nini's got so much grit
and gravel to her voice.

04:22.345 --> 04:24.848
You know,
she's a real sassy rock diva,

04:24.889 --> 04:27.267
and she's going to do so well
in this competition, I think.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.811
* Ohhh *

04:29.853 --> 04:32.564
[ Laughing ] Whoa!
Thank you. Thank you.

04:32.605 --> 04:35.358
Oh, that's why I turned around
for both of you.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.735
[ Laughter ]

04:36.776 --> 04:38.611
Oh, my God.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.697
I actually had a question
about the dynamics.

04:40.739 --> 04:43.366
I feel like, since I have
a pretty big voice,

04:43.408 --> 04:44.784
I was wondering about,
you know,

04:44.826 --> 04:46.202
learning how to put breath
in certain places.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.038
Yeah, I think it's literally
going through line by line

04:48.079 --> 04:49.456
and seeing where you're going
to finish your breath

04:49.497 --> 04:50.957
and use it
in the right spots.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.126
I think you're doing a pretty
good job of it as it is now.

04:53.168 --> 04:57.464
One thing I will say is
I think if you were to read it,

04:57.505 --> 04:59.466
like,
it's a heart-wrencher.
Yeah.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.051
So make sure
you're telling that story

05:01.092 --> 05:02.802
in your individual verses.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.721
* Once I had a love,
and it was a gas *

05:04.763 --> 05:09.684
Nini: The song is about a woman
that gets in a relationship,

05:09.726 --> 05:12.645
and it turns out
that it's not as wonderful

05:12.687 --> 05:14.606
as, like, she thought
it was going to be.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.858
I've definitely been
into, like, friendships

05:16.900 --> 05:19.611
that you think
that you can trust this person,

05:19.652 --> 05:22.989
and then it's like
they hurt you.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.616
I'm from Tbilisi, Georgia,

05:24.657 --> 05:26.868
but when I was 16,
I came to America.

05:26.910 --> 05:28.495
The person that I was
going to stay with,

05:28.536 --> 05:31.039
they were supposed to meet me
at the airport,

05:31.081 --> 05:32.582
and she was a no-show.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.334
I mean,
I tried to find places,

05:34.376 --> 05:36.044
but nobody
would give me a home

05:36.086 --> 05:38.421
because, like,
I didn't have my papers.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.173
I started working really hard.

05:40.215 --> 05:44.177
Like, I was making burritos.
I drove a rideshare.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.804
You name it, I done it.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.682
I feel like that experience
brought me here,

05:48.723 --> 05:52.686
and it just made me want to
fight even harder for my dreams.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.479
This could easily turn
into a karaoke song

05:54.521 --> 05:55.897
if we allow it to.
That's true.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.857
Make sure when you're singing
in harmony together

05:57.899 --> 06:02.404
that it doesn't get too
"We're in a bar! Ohhh!"

06:02.445 --> 06:06.783
I would even contain some
of those * Ooh, whoa, ohh *

06:06.825 --> 06:09.828
If that's a 10,
roll it back to an 8.5.

06:09.869 --> 06:10.870
Pick your moments,
of course.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.414
Nini: Yeah. Okay.
Yeah.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.541
But this is going to be
ridiculous.
Lit.

06:14.582 --> 06:16.001
Oh, my God.
Yay!

06:16.042 --> 06:18.670
Oh, and a good thing is
there are two steals this year,

06:18.712 --> 06:21.756
so just do a really good job,
both of you,

06:21.798 --> 06:23.008
so one of you gets stolen,

06:23.049 --> 06:25.260
and then I don't
have to feel so bad.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.387
How about that?
[ Laughter ]

06:27.429 --> 06:29.389
Anyway,
that's all I have to say.
Thank you.
Thank you.

06:29.431 --> 06:30.598
Team Niall slay.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.891
Both: Team Niall slay!
Over and out.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.519
I think this battle
comes down to

06:34.561 --> 06:36.021
who brings the energy
on the day.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.064
Keep in touch with me,
please.
Yes.
Absolutely.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.065
You have my e-mail.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.275
Who has the most sass?

06:40.316 --> 06:41.735
Who looks like
they're having the most fun?

06:41.776 --> 06:44.070
But also, it is
a singing competition,

06:44.112 --> 06:47.240
and we need controlled vocals
on a "rock song."

06:47.282 --> 06:49.409
Team Niall slay.

06:49.451 --> 06:50.577
This is going to be
a big battle,

06:50.618 --> 06:52.037
it's going to be
a big moment,

06:52.078 --> 06:54.998
and we're going to rip
the roof off this place.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.583
Come on!

06:56.624 --> 06:58.251
We're going to win
this thing!

Together: * ...be *

07:01.755 --> 07:03.506
Daly: ...the artists rise
to the occasion...

07:03.548 --> 07:05.550
That's the sound of a steal!

07:05.592 --> 07:07.761
...sending our coaches
into a frenzy.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.929
I'm just -- spank you.
Like, no.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.265
[ Laughter ]

07:12.307 --> 07:13.683
I love you.

* This is "The Voice" *

07:20.523 --> 07:21.649

to the battles

07:21.691 --> 07:24.235
at Universal Studios Hollywood.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.987
Reba: Good to see ya.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.989
And you and you and you and you.
How are you?

07:28.031 --> 07:29.824
Man: We'll go
in just a moment here.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.452
Isn't this amazing,
how they do this?

07:32.494 --> 07:33.745
Exciting, isn't it?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.872
Try the fried pickles.
They're really good.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.165
Okay, 30 seconds.
30 seconds.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.917
Y'all have fun.
We gonna have fun.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.628
Well, y'all enjoy
the rest of the show.

Sometimes, people come out

as the winner

something special.

She has this thing where
you can't keep your eye off her.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.286
There's a gap in the world
of music for someone like Nini,

13:06.327 --> 13:08.496

run in a straight line into it.

and build a little bit more
into that tone

18:09.547 --> 18:11.299
instead of going from soft
to [Imitates explosion]

18:11.341 --> 18:13.093
You know what I mean?
100%.

18:13.134 --> 18:16.638
* Wish I could *

18:16.680 --> 18:20.100
* I could've said goodbye *

18:20.141 --> 18:21.768
Calla:
It's a very sad song.

18:21.810 --> 18:24.562
And so, it kind of reminds me of
certain moments in my life.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.773
I moved to Nashville
January of 2020.

18:26.815 --> 18:28.608
I wanted to pursue music
full time.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.860
I didn't adapt
very well at first.

18:30.902 --> 18:33.863
Nobody talks about how hard it
is to make friends as an adult.

18:33.905 --> 18:35.240
It's very hard.

18:35.281 --> 18:38.284
I would just play piano,
and I would write by myself.

18:38.326 --> 18:39.536
That's when I honed in on, like,

18:39.577 --> 18:41.496
"This is my style,
this is my vibe,

18:41.538 --> 18:42.872
this is what I want to do."

18:42.914 --> 18:47.002
* Don't wanna start
another fire *

18:47.043 --> 18:50.505
I actually want to give a lot
of credit to my mom on this.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.590
Whenever I was younger,
if I started something,

18:52.632 --> 18:54.467
I was not allowed to quit
until the season was over,

18:54.509 --> 18:55.719
like a sport.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.554
I cannot believe
I made it to battles.

18:57.595 --> 19:01.057
I totally knew you would.
I'm so excited for you.

19:01.099 --> 19:05.520
She's a go-getter, and I think
I adopted those traits from her.

19:05.562 --> 19:11.776
Together:
* ...again *

19:11.818 --> 19:14.446
Alright, we are
onto something here.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.407
You're getting closer.
I loved that chorus.

19:17.449 --> 19:18.950
That sounded beautiful.
Okay.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.118
Yeah, it hasto be that.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.619
Got you.
Has to be that.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.872
Chechi, you know that
when you're in the bathroom

19:23.913 --> 19:27.083
and you're singing
that song to the mirror,

19:27.125 --> 19:28.585
what you have inside you --

19:28.626 --> 19:30.253
like, youknow
what you have.

19:30.295 --> 19:32.088
You just have to
let people see it.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.591
You want people
to see it, right?
Yeah.

19:34.632 --> 19:36.134
So, you just have
to figure that out.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.427
Gwen gets it.

19:37.469 --> 19:39.679
Her feedback is so uplifting,

19:39.721 --> 19:42.182
and I feel like
I can express myself.

19:42.223 --> 19:43.767
And you know what?

19:43.808 --> 19:45.935
Like, yeah, she might be a
little bit more all over the map

19:45.977 --> 19:48.688
with her millions
of different ways she can sing.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.565
You have something
that's very truthful

19:50.607 --> 19:52.108
about the way
that you perform.

19:52.150 --> 19:53.360
I just want you guys
to both know

19:53.401 --> 19:55.236
you have
really good strengths.

19:55.278 --> 19:56.946
The battles can fool you
sometimes.

19:56.988 --> 19:58.782
You think you know,
and then you get out there,

19:58.823 --> 20:01.701
and somebody just deserves it
more than the other person.

20:01.743 --> 20:04.204
I always dread these decisions.

20:04.245 --> 20:05.622
It's the worst.

20:05.663 --> 20:07.415
[ Laughing ] Ready?
One, two, three.

20:07.457 --> 20:08.708
[ Chuckles ] Perfect.

20:08.750 --> 20:12.879
We did it! We did it,
we did it, we did it!

20:19.177 --> 20:21.096
* This is "The Voice" *

20:21.137 --> 20:23.014
Daly: Welcome back.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.933
Hi, there.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.518
[ Southern accent ]
Hey, y'all. I'm Reba McEntire.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.894
[ Laughter ]

20:27.936 --> 20:30.063
You do me,
and I'll do you.
Yeah, alright.

20:30.105 --> 20:31.981
Man:
Thank you for your patience.

20:32.023 --> 20:33.108
Here we go.

20:34.067 --> 20:36.027
The battle starts now.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.946
[ Cheers and applause ]

20:50.417 --> 20:54.671
* I could've said goodbye *

20:54.713 --> 20:59.718
* I would have said
what I wanted to *

20:59.759 --> 21:04.305
* Maybe even cried
for you *

21:04.347 --> 21:07.767
* If I knew *

21:07.809 --> 21:12.063
* It would be
the last time *

21:12.105 --> 21:16.735
* I would have broke
my heart in two *

21:16.776 --> 21:20.989
* Tryin' to save
a part of you *

21:21.031 --> 21:25.201
* Don't wanna feel
another touch *

21:25.243 --> 21:29.622
* Don't wanna start

21:29.664 --> 21:33.918
* Don't wanna know

21:33.960 --> 21:38.465
* No other name falling
off my lips *

21:38.506 --> 21:45.513
* I'll never love again *

21:45.555 --> 21:48.767
* And I don't wanna know
this feeling *

21:48.808 --> 21:52.979
* Unless it's you and me *

21:53.021 --> 21:56.608
* And I don't wanna waste
a moment *

21:56.649 --> 22:02.822
* Ohhhh *

22:02.864 --> 22:06.076
* And I don't wanna give
somebody else *

22:06.117 --> 22:10.789
* The better
part of me, yeah *

22:10.830 --> 22:14.209
* I would rather
wait for you *

22:14.250 --> 22:20.006
* Ohh, youuuuuuuu *

22:20.048 --> 22:23.426
* Don't wanna feel
another touch *

22:24.177 --> 22:28.598
* Don't wanna start

Whoo!

22:28.640 --> 22:32.811
* Don't wanna know
another kiss *

22:32.852 --> 22:37.107
* Baby, unless they are
on your lips *

22:37.148 --> 22:41.820

my heart away *

* To another stranger *

22:46.032 --> 22:49.786
* Don't let

[ Cheers and applause ]

23:09.222 --> 23:13.643
**

23:13.685 --> 23:14.686
Holy crap.

23:14.728 --> 23:16.730
Are you proud of me?

23:17.564 --> 23:18.898
Aww!

23:19.649 --> 23:20.775
Wow, guys.

23:20.817 --> 23:23.695
"Wow" is right.
Wow, wow, wow.

23:23.737 --> 23:25.155
Calla, I felt like

23:25.196 --> 23:27.907
you were just waiting
to be able to burst, you know?

23:27.949 --> 23:29.826
My only issue
with your performance

23:29.868 --> 23:32.704
was you were a little unsure
about how to build it

23:32.746 --> 23:34.205
from the beginning
to the end

23:34.247 --> 23:37.083
and make all of it
feel super-compelling.

23:37.125 --> 23:39.753
But once you revved it up
into full gear,

23:39.794 --> 23:42.630
it was like,
"Okay, this girl can sing."

23:42.672 --> 23:45.467
And then, Chechi,
you're exceptionally gifted.

23:45.508 --> 23:47.052
Your range is ridiculous.

23:47.093 --> 23:50.847
The beginning,
it sounded so rich and full,

23:50.889 --> 23:52.390
and the fact
that you can do that

23:52.432 --> 23:54.893
and still hit
those super-high notes

23:54.934 --> 23:56.895
in the stratosphere
is pretty amazing.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.772
You really gave
a really great performance.

23:58.813 --> 24:01.733
[ Cheers and applause ]

24:03.234 --> 24:05.737
Chechi, your voice
is incredible.

24:05.779 --> 24:08.156
I mean,
the low to the high.

24:08.198 --> 24:10.950
You two singing together
complemented each other

24:10.992 --> 24:15.246
because, Calla,
when you sang those low notes,

24:15.288 --> 24:16.790
it was like a whisper.

24:16.831 --> 24:18.750
It was just so tender.

24:18.792 --> 24:21.628
It drew me in.
I absolutely loved it.

24:21.670 --> 24:24.756
So, the range
of this song is crazy,

24:24.798 --> 24:27.133
and you gals covered it
to perfection.

24:27.175 --> 24:30.261
Way to go. I thought it was
a very good performance.

24:30.303 --> 24:34.557
If I did have to pick somebody,
to help you out,

24:34.599 --> 24:35.684
Chechi.

24:35.725 --> 24:36.935
Thank you.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.813
[ Cheers and applause ]

24:39.854 --> 24:41.272
Niall: Girls,
that was magic.

24:41.314 --> 24:43.566
That's such a tough song
to take on, first of all.

24:43.608 --> 24:44.901
She should
really apologize.

24:44.943 --> 24:46.569
You come on "The Voice,"
you better bring it.

24:46.611 --> 24:48.446
[ Laughter ]

24:48.488 --> 24:50.365
Calla, that thing that Reba
was just talking about,

24:50.407 --> 24:51.741
that whisper,
I was like,

24:51.783 --> 24:53.368
"Oh, I could listen
to that forever."

24:53.410 --> 24:56.287
Thank you.
It was so tasteful
and really compelling

24:56.329 --> 24:58.164
and love-- compelling,
to use a word of John's.

24:58.206 --> 25:01.418
I'm basically
turning into a thesaurus
because of John Legend.

25:01.459 --> 25:04.087
Sometimes I go home and Google
everything John said.

25:04.129 --> 25:05.755
[ Laughter ]

25:05.797 --> 25:07.382
I was an English major.

25:07.424 --> 25:08.800
This is, you know.
Ooh!

25:08.842 --> 25:10.218
[ Laughter ]

25:10.260 --> 25:12.387
And I didn't finish
high school.

25:12.429 --> 25:14.931
[ Laughter ]

25:14.973 --> 25:17.809
Chechi, sometimes it looked
like you weren't sure

25:17.851 --> 25:19.144
about the note
you were going to hit,

25:19.185 --> 25:21.479
and you brought it
into a nasal point

25:21.521 --> 25:23.314
up here for safety,

25:23.356 --> 25:27.027
instead of going,
"I'm going to that note."

25:27.068 --> 25:28.611
And I would watch out
for that, for sure.

25:28.653 --> 25:30.405
But another
super performance

25:30.447 --> 25:31.948
for both of you,
actually, to be honest.

25:31.990 --> 25:34.242
Gwennie!
I know.

25:34.284 --> 25:35.118
You did it again.

25:35.160 --> 25:37.037
I know.
Here I am again.

25:37.078 --> 25:38.997
Daly:
Thank you, coaches.

25:39.039 --> 25:42.250
Calla, it was emotional.
It was perfect.

25:42.292 --> 25:43.960
It was in tune.
The look on your face.

25:44.002 --> 25:46.129
Everything you did
was perfection.

25:46.171 --> 25:48.298
Chechi,
you're so amazing.

25:48.340 --> 25:51.593
That was like a Grammys
first verse, like, for me.

25:51.634 --> 25:53.094
Thank you.
It was so good.

25:53.136 --> 25:54.929
But I could still see
this little bit

25:54.971 --> 25:56.598
of insecure version of you

25:56.639 --> 25:59.851
that doesn't belong
on that stage or in your life.

25:59.893 --> 26:01.227
Like, you are just
not that girl.

26:01.269 --> 26:03.730

I don't know.

26:03.772 --> 26:07.108
I'm just -- spank you.

an incredible performance.

whatever you want.

it was a great battle.

26:37.222 --> 26:39.015
That means a really
difficult decision.

26:39.057 --> 26:42.519
But we need to know, who is
the winner of this battle?

26:42.560 --> 26:44.145
Aaah! This is so hard.

26:44.187 --> 26:47.023
Thank you guys for trusting me
and working with me.

26:47.065 --> 26:48.233
I really enjoyed it.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.235
You inspired me,
both of you have.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.444
But I have to choose somebody.

26:51.486 --> 26:55.323
And the winner
of this battle is...

26:55.365 --> 26:56.366
Chechi.

26:56.408 --> 26:58.284
Chechi, congratulations!

26:58.326 --> 27:00.829
You are moving on
to the knockouts for Team Gwen.

27:00.870 --> 27:02.247
Gwen:
It was a really hard decision,

27:02.288 --> 27:04.749
but I just know
that Chechi has what it takes

27:04.791 --> 27:06.626
to have a flawless performance.

27:06.668 --> 27:08.253
She has an original sound.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.922
She's somebody I can really
work with, and I can help her.

27:10.964 --> 27:12.257
I'm excited for that.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.592
Daly: Give it up
for Calla Prejean, everybody.

27:14.634 --> 27:17.053
Gwen: It's just really hard to
watch talented people go home.

27:17.095 --> 27:20.140
But so far, my team is amazing.
It's on fire.

27:20.181 --> 27:22.308
There's a lot
of talented singers.

27:22.350 --> 27:24.060
You're my favorite person
in the world.

to be on this season.

at goodbyes *

is so intriguing,

and it's, like, mysterious
and ethereal.

The winner of this battle
is Caleb.

27:55.425 --> 27:57.260

in Caleb.

I see his artistry
and his uniqueness

27:59.763 --> 28:01.056
in everything he does,

28:01.097 --> 28:02.891
and I'm excited to see
what he does next.

* Telling my whole life *

28:18.823 --> 28:21.368
Lila, you have
a unique magic

28:21.409 --> 28:23.995
to the way that you
express yourself musically.

28:24.037 --> 28:26.498
The winner of this battle
is Lila.

28:26.539 --> 28:28.958
Lila, congratulations!

28:29.000 --> 28:31.336
John: Something
about Lila just stood out.

28:31.378 --> 28:34.005
It's this slinky, beautiful,

28:34.047 --> 28:36.508
classic '70s
singer/songwriter voice.

28:36.549 --> 28:39.177
She was demanding to advance
to the knockout.

28:39.219 --> 28:41.179
And I believe I have
at least a couple people

28:41.221 --> 28:43.848
on Team Legend
that could win "The Voice."

28:43.890 --> 28:46.017
So, we have Reba next.

28:46.059 --> 28:47.852
Man, this is fun.

28:47.894 --> 28:49.604
It's not at all.
I hate it.

28:49.646 --> 28:51.439
[ Laughter ]

28:57.737 --> 28:58.905
* This is "The Voice" *

28:58.947 --> 29:01.032
Daly: Welcome back
to the battles.

29:01.074 --> 29:07.706
**

29:07.747 --> 29:14.170
**

29:14.212 --> 29:16.297
Well, well, well.

29:16.339 --> 29:18.216
Look what we've got here.

29:18.258 --> 29:19.759
"John's 'Voice' Playbook."

29:19.801 --> 29:21.261
"I knew you would read this,

29:21.302 --> 29:24.431
Niall,
and try to cheat."

29:27.100 --> 29:29.602
Niall: "You'll never know
my secrets."

29:29.644 --> 29:31.646
Caught you, Niall!

29:31.688 --> 29:33.273
You'll never defeat me!

29:33.314 --> 29:35.525
[ Laughs evilly ]

29:37.485 --> 29:39.821
Can't barely see back here.
Ain't no light.

29:39.863 --> 29:41.531
But, Rach, how you feeling?

29:41.573 --> 29:42.449
Man: Rach?

29:42.490 --> 29:45.285
Oh, me?
Yeah, you. [ Laughs ]

29:45.326 --> 29:46.411
I'm trying to connect
to the Wi-Fi.

29:46.453 --> 29:47.537
That's my number-one
priority.

29:47.579 --> 29:49.622
We always need Wi-Fi
everywhere.

29:49.664 --> 29:52.083
Mac: Rachele is
absolutely phenomenal.

29:52.125 --> 29:54.127
She wants to practice
every day,

29:54.169 --> 29:55.754
and she always
has all these ideas.

29:55.795 --> 29:57.047
She would just text me like,

29:57.088 --> 29:58.298
"Mac, so what do you think
about this?"

29:58.340 --> 29:59.466
Or "What do you think
about that?"

29:59.507 --> 30:01.009
Rachele:
With Mac, I'm very excited

30:01.051 --> 30:02.844
just because
we have the same vibe.

30:02.886 --> 30:03.970
We know what we're about to do.

30:04.012 --> 30:05.430
His voice -- oh, my gosh.

30:05.472 --> 30:07.557
Every time I listen to it,
I'm just like, "Ooh!"

30:07.599 --> 30:09.434
Like, I get the shivers.

30:09.476 --> 30:11.936
Well, hi, there.
Hello.
Hey.

30:11.978 --> 30:13.772
How you doing?
Hi, Rachele.
Hi, Mac.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.440
How you guys doing?
I'm good. How are you?

30:15.482 --> 30:16.983
Come here
and give me a hug.

30:17.025 --> 30:18.485
I feel like we're kind of
making history

30:18.526 --> 30:20.653
just because we are
on her first team,

30:20.695 --> 30:23.281
and I'm very excited
to have her as my coach.

30:23.323 --> 30:24.407
Let's do it.
Oh, my gosh.

30:24.449 --> 30:27.410
Reba is
a literal living legend.

30:27.452 --> 30:29.454
I've been trying my best
not to lose my mind

30:29.496 --> 30:31.164
at the fact that I'm here,
you know?

30:31.206 --> 30:32.665
So, this is crazy.

30:32.707 --> 30:35.293
Y'all did such a great job
on the blind auditions,

30:35.335 --> 30:36.711
or you wouldn't
be here today.

30:36.753 --> 30:39.005
So, that's
a confidence booster, too.

30:39.047 --> 30:40.006
Yeah, for sure.

30:40.048 --> 30:44.386
* You cut me open and I *

30:44.427 --> 30:46.346
Reba: I was the only one
that turned for Rachele.

30:46.388 --> 30:48.556
But, man, I heard
something different there.

30:48.598 --> 30:51.434
It was angelic,
power where it needed.

30:51.476 --> 30:53.978
I'm so glad
I turned around for her.

30:54.020 --> 30:57.941
* Gravity, ooh *

30:57.982 --> 30:59.150
Four chairs!

30:59.192 --> 31:01.194
Reba: Mac was
a four-chair turn.

31:01.236 --> 31:02.737
You're going with me?!
Yeah.

31:02.779 --> 31:04.656
Reba: I was thrilled to death
to get him on my team.

31:04.698 --> 31:08.201
He said his grandmother loved
watching my TV show.

31:08.243 --> 31:09.494
Way to go.

31:09.536 --> 31:13.748
* I know your eyes
in the morning sun *

31:13.790 --> 31:15.333
* I feel your touch... *

31:15.375 --> 31:17.544
I paired Mac with Rachele,
and they're singing

31:17.585 --> 31:19.921
"How Deep is Your Love,"
the Bee Gees' song.

31:19.963 --> 31:23.383
I paired them together because
they are in the R&B space.

31:23.425 --> 31:25.260
Rachele's very soft,

31:25.301 --> 31:27.429
and then, Mac can also
get very soft,

31:27.470 --> 31:29.806
especially when he's going up
into falsetto.

31:29.848 --> 31:32.308
And I thought they could
play off each other better.

31:33.810 --> 31:34.769
* How deep is your love,
how deep... *

31:36.688 --> 31:38.648
This is probably
one of the most iconic

31:38.690 --> 31:41.484
and beautifully written songs
of all time.

31:41.526 --> 31:43.737
People need to feel that love.

31:43.778 --> 31:46.489
I enjoy being able
to create a space

31:46.531 --> 31:49.367
where people can feel that
through my music

31:49.409 --> 31:53.246
* And it's me
you need to show *

31:53.288 --> 31:54.914
* How deep is your love *

31:54.956 --> 31:57.792
Being a professional busker,
out performing on the street,

31:57.834 --> 32:00.712
some days you might
make a load of money,

32:00.754 --> 32:03.923
and then some days
you may make change.

32:03.965 --> 32:06.301
But it shaped my artistry

32:06.343 --> 32:09.262
because having all of
those distractions around

32:09.304 --> 32:11.765
while I was in the midst
of performing

32:11.806 --> 32:15.769
made me, like, really
focus on my craft.

32:15.810 --> 32:18.855
But there's so much more
that I'll learn

32:18.897 --> 32:20.523
from working with Reba.

32:20.565 --> 32:22.192
I'm forever grateful for that.

32:22.233 --> 32:23.693
Reba: Very good.
Very good.

32:23.735 --> 32:26.446
Now, Mac, I didn't think
you were hearing the beat.

32:26.488 --> 32:28.656
You kind of went
a different direction on it.

32:28.698 --> 32:30.950
I guess when we were practicing,
we just wanted to,

32:30.992 --> 32:32.660
like, pay homage
to the Bee Gees,

32:32.702 --> 32:35.288
but also, like, give the people
just a little bit

32:35.330 --> 32:37.499
of what we do
or what we like, so...

32:37.540 --> 32:39.626
Well, the reason we pick
the songs we do

32:39.668 --> 32:41.670
is because
of familiarity.
Got you.

32:41.711 --> 32:43.755
When I'm out
on a concert tour,

32:43.797 --> 32:46.132
those people out there
who paid that hard-earned money

32:46.174 --> 32:47.759
to come listen to me sing,

32:47.801 --> 32:50.011
they want something
they can sing along to.
Right.

32:50.053 --> 32:53.515
So, when you're singing a song
that is so well known

32:53.556 --> 32:55.517
as "How Deep Is Your Love,"

32:55.558 --> 32:58.311
you need to stay
with the melody I remember

32:58.353 --> 33:00.897
so I can sing with,
be a part of the show.

33:00.939 --> 33:02.732
Got you.
Got you, for sure.

33:02.774 --> 33:07.028
* 'Cause we're living
in a world of fools *

33:07.070 --> 33:08.905
Rachele: Because I am
a minor on Reba's team,

33:08.947 --> 33:10.198
I feel that there are people

33:10.240 --> 33:11.866
that may look at me
as a little kid

33:11.908 --> 33:14.577
or kind of have that sympathy
for me just because I'm a minor.

33:14.619 --> 33:16.913
But I want to bring it my all
and just prove to them, as well,

33:16.955 --> 33:18.665
that I am here for a reason.

33:18.707 --> 33:20.291
There's still so much to learn,

33:20.333 --> 33:22.711
and I feel very honored
to be here.

33:22.752 --> 33:24.462
I am excited
for the battle round,

33:24.504 --> 33:26.631
and I hope that I do get further
in the competition.

33:26.673 --> 33:29.718
Rachele, you know, you really
get into the body movement,

33:29.759 --> 33:32.762
and your eyes are closed,
and it's beautiful,

33:32.804 --> 33:36.016
but when you open your eyes,
hone in on somebody.

33:36.057 --> 33:41.479
* And you come to me
on a summer breeze *

33:41.521 --> 33:43.565
Rachele: One of my habits
is that I really like

33:43.606 --> 33:45.025
to close my eyes
when I sing.

33:45.066 --> 33:47.360
So, when you see me singing,
I'm literally, like,

33:47.402 --> 33:49.779
sleepwalking and singing
at the same time.

33:49.821 --> 33:51.865
I just need some duct tape
on my eyes, though,

33:51.906 --> 33:52.866
and I'll be fine.

33:52.907 --> 33:54.242
I am still working on it,

33:54.284 --> 33:56.703
but, like, by battle round,
my eyes will be open.

33:56.745 --> 33:59.581
When you get on that stage
during the battle rounds,

33:59.622 --> 34:02.542
you're selling your song,
your idea.

34:02.584 --> 34:04.627
You're selling yourself
to the audience,

34:04.669 --> 34:07.047
and it's all in emotions.
Okay.

34:07.088 --> 34:08.882
Barry Manilow told me
one time, he said,

34:08.923 --> 34:10.967
"Were you smiling?"
He was in the control room.

34:11.009 --> 34:12.218
I said, "No."

34:12.260 --> 34:14.054
He said, "In the lyric,
if you smile,

34:14.095 --> 34:16.806
it comes out and you get more
of that emotion."

34:16.848 --> 34:19.434
So, when it merits it,
smile.

34:19.476 --> 34:21.561
Got you.
Okay, cool.

34:21.603 --> 34:23.146
I definitely made
the right choice of Reba,

34:23.188 --> 34:24.689
without question.

34:24.731 --> 34:27.150
Just hearing, you know,
all of these tips and tricks

34:27.192 --> 34:30.236
from somebody that's been
in the industry that long,

34:30.278 --> 34:32.989
like, it gave me
a little more confidence.

34:33.031 --> 34:34.449
So, I'm just going to go

34:34.491 --> 34:37.577
and deliver the best performance
that I possibly can.

34:37.619 --> 34:39.079
I turned for both of you

34:39.120 --> 34:41.706
because there was something
very special in your voices.

34:41.748 --> 34:44.584
You both have a great look.

34:44.626 --> 34:46.586
You're individuals.

34:46.628 --> 34:48.004
And then,
when you sang together,

34:48.046 --> 34:50.590
I couldn't believe
how well your voices blend.

34:50.632 --> 34:53.426
Way to go, way to go,
way to go.

34:53.468 --> 34:55.762
Y'all are so good.

34:55.804 --> 34:57.889
Reba: The battle
will come down to

34:57.931 --> 35:00.600
how they touch my heart
when they're performing.

35:00.642 --> 35:03.061
And may the best singer win.

35:03.103 --> 35:04.354
Whew!

35:04.396 --> 35:06.856
So many talented people
in this world.

Aww, look how happy she is!

Oh, my gosh.
That's cute as a button.

37:59.654 --> 38:01.489
[ Exhales sharply ] Wow.

38:01.531 --> 38:03.033
Guys, that was so good.

38:03.074 --> 38:05.785
To take on a song of
that stature is brave in itself.

38:05.827 --> 38:07.328
I thought the two of you
were fantastic.

38:07.370 --> 38:09.164
Mac, I heard
a few pitch issues early on,

38:09.205 --> 38:10.498
but apart from that,

38:10.540 --> 38:12.334
it was pretty solid,
especially in the harmony.

38:12.375 --> 38:15.337
I think it's so hard sometimes
to go in and out like you were,

38:15.378 --> 38:17.589
and she's singing in
a completely different octave,

38:17.630 --> 38:20.008
and you were ready
to take that first note,

38:20.050 --> 38:21.926
having heard
a much higher note before that.

38:21.968 --> 38:23.553
It was super-impressive,
Mac.

38:23.595 --> 38:25.055
Rachele,
that was so good.

38:25.096 --> 38:27.432
So much better than I remember
the first audition,

38:27.474 --> 38:29.351
and I'm sitting around there,
going, "Why didn't I turn?"

38:29.392 --> 38:31.311
Eeee!
[ Laughter ]

38:31.353 --> 38:32.645
You were really good.

38:32.687 --> 38:34.272
Like, it was so nice.
Thank you so much.

38:34.314 --> 38:35.315
It was so beautiful.

38:35.357 --> 38:36.775
To be your age, at 17,

38:36.816 --> 38:39.861
and to have that composure
and will to just be like,

38:39.903 --> 38:42.072
"Give me the biggest song
you've got."

38:42.113 --> 38:44.240
It's not easy, Reba.
[ Laughs ] I know.

38:44.282 --> 38:47.035
For me, I think
I'll go to Rachele.

38:47.077 --> 38:48.453
Rachele? Okay.

38:48.495 --> 38:51.039
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

38:51.081 --> 38:53.708
Mac, like,
I love your voice so much.

38:53.750 --> 38:57.504
It's so warm and buttery
and just, I mean, incredible.

38:57.545 --> 38:59.381
And Rachele,
the fact you're 17,

38:59.422 --> 39:02.092
I hate to throw that in there,
because singing is singing,

39:02.133 --> 39:04.052
but the things
that you can do with your voice

39:04.094 --> 39:07.055
and your instincts,
it's pretty magical.

39:07.097 --> 39:09.099
If I really had
to pick right now...

39:09.140 --> 39:11.059
[ Squeals ]

39:11.101 --> 39:13.478
I don't have to pick,
so that's perfect.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.271
[ Laughter ]

39:15.313 --> 39:16.272
"I won't be doing that."

39:16.314 --> 39:18.108
John:
Ah, that's funny.

39:18.149 --> 39:21.361
Mac, I just love
the sound of your voice.

39:21.403 --> 39:23.071
Me, too.
It's just so gorgeous.

39:23.113 --> 39:26.991
It is soulful, and it's got,
like, richness and character,

39:27.033 --> 39:29.786
and it's just the kind of voice
I love to hear.

39:29.828 --> 39:31.162
There were a couple
pitch moments.

39:31.204 --> 39:33.039
I felt like it was really
in that early part,

39:33.081 --> 39:35.959
but once you revved up,
it was buttery gorgeousness.

39:36.001 --> 39:37.293
So good.

39:37.335 --> 39:40.005
And, Rachele, you were doing
so many exciting things,

39:40.046 --> 39:42.257
so many cool
musical choices

39:42.298 --> 39:44.092
and runs
and things of that nature.

39:44.134 --> 39:46.094
Reba, I think
it's a hard decision.

39:46.136 --> 39:48.054
If I were to pick,
I would probably go with Mac

39:48.096 --> 39:50.765
just because
personal preference on tone.

39:50.807 --> 39:51.766
Okay.
Thanks, John.

39:51.808 --> 39:53.476
Daly: Thank you, coaches.

39:53.518 --> 39:55.353
[ Cheers and applause ]

39:55.395 --> 39:57.272
Alright, Reba,
you've got the final decision.

39:57.313 --> 40:00.066
But first, give us
some thoughts on that battle.

40:00.108 --> 40:03.611
Rachele, you had
such enthusiasm,

40:03.653 --> 40:06.614
and your range
was incredible.

40:06.656 --> 40:08.199
You did a wonderful job.

40:08.241 --> 40:09.284
Very proud of you.

40:09.325 --> 40:11.828
Mac, I still wish
we could have stayed

40:11.870 --> 40:14.247
with the Bee Gees' version
of the opening,

40:14.289 --> 40:16.207
because that
kind of threw me again,

40:16.249 --> 40:18.043
as it did
in our rehearsals.

40:18.084 --> 40:21.671
Maybe that was the pitch thing
you guys were talking about.

40:21.713 --> 40:23.840
But, man, your vocals
are incredible.

40:23.882 --> 40:26.176
I'm just so proud
of you both.

40:26.217 --> 40:27.635
That's a great song
to sing,

40:27.677 --> 40:29.929
and you did
a wonderful job on it.

40:29.971 --> 40:31.973
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you.

40:32.015 --> 40:33.975
Reba, a really tough decision
for you,

40:34.017 --> 40:35.143
but the time has come.

40:35.185 --> 40:37.103
Who is the winner
of this battle?

40:37.145 --> 40:38.313
Reba: Well...

40:38.355 --> 40:42.150
**

40:42.192 --> 40:45.320
The winner of this battle
is Rachele.

40:45.362 --> 40:47.238
Rachele, congratulations!

40:47.280 --> 40:50.200
You're moving on
to the knockouts for Team Reba!

40:50.241 --> 40:52.494
Reba: Rachele --
man, she just blew me away.

40:52.535 --> 40:55.622
She's got a great package,
all the way around.

40:55.663 --> 40:57.165
She's beautiful.
Great voice.

40:57.207 --> 41:00.043
And for her to beat out
a four-chair turn says a lot.

41:00.085 --> 41:02.212
Coaches, let me remind you
that Mac's available to steal.

41:02.253 --> 41:04.673
Mac, anything you want
to say to your coach?

41:04.714 --> 41:07.425
Um, I just want to say --
[ Whoosh ]

41:07.467 --> 41:10.178
That's the sound of a steal!

41:10.220 --> 41:15.809
John Legend uses his steal
on Mac from Team Reba!

41:16.893 --> 41:18.436
Come on home, bro.

41:18.478 --> 41:20.563
John: Mac has the kind of voice
that I love to listen to.

41:20.605 --> 41:22.315
Just right in my wheelhouse.

41:22.357 --> 41:24.984
He has the stage presence,
the confidence.

41:25.026 --> 41:27.696
He just sounds like
he should be a star right now.

41:27.737 --> 41:29.948
I want to hear a Mac record.

41:29.989 --> 41:32.033
Maybe he should have always been
on Team Legend.

41:32.075 --> 41:33.868
Time to come on home, Mac.

41:33.910 --> 41:36.705
That's great.
Yeah, he's really good.

41:36.746 --> 41:39.207
Let's go!
Whoo, yeah!

41:39.249 --> 41:40.709
Mac,
you're on Team Legend.

41:40.750 --> 41:42.168
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The Legend and the Mac.

41:42.210 --> 41:44.879
I'm looking forward to John,
like, really giving me

41:44.921 --> 41:46.881
the game on, like,
how we going to win this show.

41:46.923 --> 41:49.634
Let's go, let's go.
You know what I'm saying?
Like, that's what's going on.

41:49.676 --> 41:51.511
Ridiculous voice.
Totally great.

41:51.553 --> 41:52.762
He has a disgusting voice.

41:52.804 --> 41:54.514
His voice
is disgusting, Gwen?

41:54.556 --> 41:55.724
In, like, a good way.

41:55.765 --> 41:58.518
Like, it's opposite day
today, Niall.
