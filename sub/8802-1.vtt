01:28.101 --> 01:31.559
Stand firm, men, for
the King and Monteria!

01:33.907 --> 01:35.499
Back to the sea, dog!

01:45.218 --> 01:46.845
Prince Alexander!

01:53.660 --> 01:57.756
Drop your weapons or say
goodbye to your prince!

02:00.133 --> 02:03.625
Robert. I should have known you
were behind this cowardly attack.

02:03.703 --> 02:07.867
Hello, nephew. Sorry I've
missed the family reunions,

02:08.275 --> 02:12.177
but it's been difficult,
being banished and all.

02:12.512 --> 02:14.776
Your punishment
was well-earned.

02:14.848 --> 02:17.373
That depends
on your point of view.

02:17.684 --> 02:21.916
But since your daddy has left
you alone and unprotected,

02:22.355 --> 02:26.621
I thought we could get
reacquainted.

02:26.893 --> 02:28.690
His absence
is but temporary.

02:28.795 --> 02:30.990
He has business
across the Western Sea.

02:31.064 --> 02:33.055
Is that what he told you?

02:34.501 --> 02:37.937
He knew I was growing strong
in the mechanical arts.

02:38.171 --> 02:40.605
Too strong, perhaps,
for even him.

02:41.541 --> 02:45.637
You fight bravely
for the son of a coward.

02:53.787 --> 02:55.721
Tie him up!
Your cutlass!

02:55.789 --> 02:57.950
Plenty more at home.
Leave it.

02:58.024 --> 03:00.720
A calling card
for my cowardly brother.

03:01.561 --> 03:05.657
Take him aboard the <i>Stubb!</i>
And be sure to bring the princess as well!

03:05.732 --> 03:08.724
She's not here.
She stayed behind in Monteria.

03:10.437 --> 03:13.304
Search the ship.
Find the girl.

03:13.373 --> 03:15.500
I tell you,
she's not here!

03:33.593 --> 03:35.026
Aha!

03:51.878 --> 03:53.903
Are you certain
he's gone?

03:54.581 --> 03:58.278
I say, my lady, it may be
prudent to remain under wraps.

03:59.219 --> 04:00.447
My lady?

04:01.755 --> 04:03.450
My brother needs help.

04:03.523 --> 04:06.788
Oh, heavens, my lady!
As your butler, I cannot allow you to...

04:06.860 --> 04:08.293
Step aside, Willory.

04:08.361 --> 04:10.488
But, my lady,
it's a boatful of pirates

04:10.564 --> 04:12.930
and your fencing classes
have just begun!

04:12.999 --> 04:15.229
You're not yet
up to the task!

04:16.202 --> 04:17.635
Perhaps you're right.

04:17.704 --> 04:19.762
Then there's only
one thing to do.

04:19.839 --> 04:22.899
Indeed. Stay hidden until
the rogues have left.

04:24.210 --> 04:25.438
My lady?

04:26.913 --> 04:28.278
What is it?

04:28.381 --> 04:31.179
It's from my father.
His own creation.

04:31.818 --> 04:35.879
He said I was to use it only
in the gravest of circumstances.

04:37.157 --> 04:39.489
I'd say this qualifies.

04:39.559 --> 04:41.186
But what does it do?

04:41.261 --> 04:42.922
It's a Helpseeker.

04:47.767 --> 04:50.395
We need help.
Alexander has been taken.

04:50.704 --> 04:53.639
The situation is dire.
Please bring back...

04:54.374 --> 04:56.774
Let me see.
What do we need?

04:57.277 --> 04:59.006
The army! The navy!

04:59.179 --> 05:02.740
Heroes. We need heroes
that can save Alexander!

05:19.733 --> 05:21.598
She's not on board, sir.

05:21.668 --> 05:25.832
Blast! Send spies to Monteria
and the surrounding isles.

05:25.905 --> 05:27.702
I need them both.

05:42.355 --> 05:43.583
Heroes?

05:44.624 --> 05:47.149
Yes. Heroes.

06:21.961 --> 06:23.656
<i>Oh</i>

06:23.730 --> 06:25.698
<i>It's Spanish gold</i>
<i>for all tonight</i>

06:25.765 --> 06:27.756
<i>For King and country,</i>
<i>now we fight</i>

06:27.834 --> 06:30.735
<i>Our shirts are loose</i>
<i>Our pants are tight</i>

06:30.804 --> 06:32.704
<i>It's Spanish gold</i>
<i>for all tonight</i>

06:32.772 --> 06:34.831
<i>It's Spanish gold</i>
<i>for all tonight</i>

06:34.908 --> 06:36.341
Have you seen
the show before?

06:36.409 --> 06:37.740
No, too expensive.

06:37.811 --> 06:40.541
My boyfriend got me in for
free tonight. He works here.

06:40.613 --> 06:43.104
Oh, mine, too.
Family Night, right?

06:43.183 --> 06:44.946
Right.
Is he in the show?

06:45.018 --> 06:47.316
No, he's just
a cabin boy.

06:47.387 --> 06:49.753
Same here.
But not for long.

06:49.823 --> 06:53.759
Elliot says he's a shoo-in for
the show, as soon as he tries out.

06:53.827 --> 06:57.024
Wait. You're Elliot's date?
Our boyfriends are friends!

06:58.198 --> 06:59.426
Is that bad?

06:59.499 --> 07:02.400
No. There's something
behind you.

07:04.637 --> 07:06.036
Where is he?

07:06.573 --> 07:09.007
For the flower
of all gourds.

07:10.543 --> 07:13.239
Oh, Sedgewick,
you're too cute.

07:13.546 --> 07:15.036
Anything for you, Ellen.

07:15.115 --> 07:17.015
<i>It's Spanish gold</i>
<i>for all tonight</i>

07:17.083 --> 07:19.051
<i>As Spaniards quake</i>
<i>to see the sight</i>

07:19.119 --> 07:22.088
<i>Our flag unfurled</i>
<i>with black and white</i>

07:24.090 --> 07:28.993
<i>It's Spanish gold</i>
<i>for all tonight!</i>

07:29.062 --> 07:30.324
Hooray, Sir Frederick!

07:30.396 --> 07:32.125
Picture for
the happy couple?

07:32.198 --> 07:33.222
Sure, why not?

07:33.299 --> 07:36.063
Oh, Sedgewick, come here.
Put your face close to me.

07:38.705 --> 07:40.002
Look at that.
<i>Soy la reina.</i>

07:40.073 --> 07:41.870
I'm the queen,
you're the king.

07:44.010 --> 07:46.478
I'll catch up
with you later.

07:47.514 --> 07:49.948
Hey!
Cabin boy! Refill!

07:50.817 --> 07:53.650
I'm telling you this job
will be the death of me.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.551
But you're going to
keep at it

07:55.622 --> 07:58.614
so you don't end up back
in your parents' basement.

07:58.691 --> 07:59.658
Right.

07:59.726 --> 08:00.920
I like your toy.

08:00.994 --> 08:04.191
It's not a toy, it's
a labor-saving device!

08:04.731 --> 08:07.996
Sedgewick, meet Bernadette.
She's Elliot's girlfriend.

08:08.067 --> 08:09.364
Pleased to meet you.

08:09.435 --> 08:11.913
Sweetie, how about
having your little car

08:11.914 --> 08:13.565
fetch me some barbecue sauce?

08:13.640 --> 08:14.629
It's in the back room.

08:18.144 --> 08:19.611
Out of range.

08:20.046 --> 08:23.743
Well, how about you fetch
me some barbecue sauce?

08:24.117 --> 08:27.382
It's in the back room.
Out of range.

08:27.754 --> 08:28.846
Sedgewick!

08:28.922 --> 08:31.823
There he is now. Hi, Elliot.

08:31.891 --> 08:32.914
Hey, Bernadette.

08:32.991 --> 08:34.653
Elliot, would you run
to the back room

08:34.727 --> 08:37.491
and get some barbecue sauce
for my new friend, Ellen?

08:37.563 --> 08:40.863
You know I would, Bernadette,
but, it's just that

08:41.034 --> 08:44.731
the back room
is real, real dark.

08:46.072 --> 08:47.130
And?

08:47.540 --> 08:49.030
It's on my list.

08:49.108 --> 08:50.370
His list?

08:50.743 --> 08:54.611
His list of things he's afraid of.
It's extensive.

08:54.981 --> 08:57.381
Well, I don't need
barbecue sauce that badly.

08:57.450 --> 08:58.815
Why doesn't
he get it?

08:58.885 --> 09:00.182
Too much work.

09:00.253 --> 09:01.880
George!
- Huh?

09:01.955 --> 09:06.016
We'll have George get it.
You can talk him into anything.

09:06.292 --> 09:07.316
I'm back!

09:07.393 --> 09:08.951
What took so long?

09:09.362 --> 09:12.820
Oh, I had to run an errand
for another cabin boy.

09:13.199 --> 09:14.427
George.

09:14.500 --> 09:17.867
Oh, it was nothing.
How do the kids like the show?

09:17.937 --> 09:21.373
It's great. Did you see Sir Frederick
knock that guy into the water?

09:21.441 --> 09:23.432
I liked it when he
swung on the rope.

09:23.509 --> 09:25.568
They're both pretty taken
with Sir Frederick.

09:25.645 --> 09:27.272
He's cool!
Yeah!

09:27.647 --> 09:28.671
Right.

09:28.748 --> 09:30.134
Hey, after the show's over,

09:30.135 --> 09:32.548
you want me to take you
down on the pirate ship?

09:32.619 --> 09:34.280
Sir Frederick
is gonna take us.

09:34.354 --> 09:35.378
What?

09:35.455 --> 09:37.446
You don't need to wait
for Sir Frederick.

09:37.523 --> 09:39.718
I could take you
on the set tonight.

09:39.792 --> 09:42.625
Yeah, Dad, but Mom says
if we come back on Friday

09:42.695 --> 09:46.791
I can bring some money and get a
sword just like Sir Frederick's.

09:46.866 --> 09:48.731
I'll wait till Friday.

09:48.835 --> 09:52.271
You're no match for me!

09:52.338 --> 09:55.501
Take that!
Taste my steel!

09:55.575 --> 09:58.169
Cool!
Did you see Sir Frederick?

09:58.244 --> 09:59.643
He's a hero!

10:07.420 --> 10:09.854
Hey, cabin boy!
Refill!

10:11.524 --> 10:12.718
Coming.

10:24.938 --> 10:27.168
I can't believe my own
kids are coming back

10:27.240 --> 10:29.606
to get a tour
from Sir Frederick.

10:29.809 --> 10:31.470
It's just 'cause
he's in the show.

10:31.544 --> 10:35.241
And he's big and strong
and brave and manly.

10:36.282 --> 10:38.750
When I'm in the show,
after my audition,

10:38.818 --> 10:40.843
Bernadette'll think
I'm a hero, too.

10:40.920 --> 10:43.081
Yeah, after
your audition.

10:43.156 --> 10:46.683
Look at George here. This guy
knows every line in that show.

10:46.759 --> 10:50.058
He knows more about pirates
than Blackbeard himself.

10:50.530 --> 10:52.157
So, why didn't
he try out?

10:52.231 --> 10:54.358
Yeah, George.
Why don't you?

10:54.434 --> 10:57.562
It would never work.
I'm just not the type.

10:58.237 --> 10:59.704
There you go.

11:09.115 --> 11:12.482
Excuse me, sir.
The day's show is over.

11:14.120 --> 11:16.554
I say, the show is over.

11:16.622 --> 11:20.558
The hour is near.
The call is coming.

11:20.626 --> 11:22.719
Adventure awaits.

11:23.496 --> 11:28.126
Though you will stumble, the
crab will show you the light.

11:28.868 --> 11:33.532
When adversity devours you,
a lever will set you free.

11:34.574 --> 11:40.706
When all hope is gone, help will
come from above in the shape of

11:41.914 --> 11:43.711
a donkey!

11:44.817 --> 11:47.183
Take heed, O friends.

11:47.253 --> 11:52.190
The stage is set
for the heroes at hand.

12:04.704 --> 12:08.071
The crab of adversity
will devour the donkey?

12:08.141 --> 12:09.904
What was that about?

12:10.309 --> 12:14.177
And why would a blind guy come
to a dinner theater, anyway?

12:14.614 --> 12:16.605
Maybe he likes the music.

12:17.617 --> 12:19.482
I know what it means.
- What?

12:19.552 --> 12:23.079
Don't you see? "The stage is
set for the heroes at hand."

12:23.156 --> 12:24.987
We're gonna be
in the show, all of us.

12:25.058 --> 12:26.082
What?

12:26.159 --> 12:28.320
Listen to me.
There's the stage.

12:28.394 --> 12:31.022
We're the heroes
at hand. Get it?

12:31.097 --> 12:34.191
If we all audition,
we're going to be stars.

12:34.267 --> 12:35.962
How would he know?

12:36.536 --> 12:39.300
The blind are often
blessed with keen insight.

12:39.372 --> 12:42.170
Our gals would really look up
to us if we were in the show.

12:42.241 --> 12:44.732
And my kids would think
I'm a hero.

12:45.311 --> 12:48.906
The stage is set
for the heroes at hand.

12:48.981 --> 12:51.973
I got my own set of pirate
costumes in my locker.

12:52.051 --> 12:55.612
I've been saving them for,
you know, whatever.

12:55.688 --> 12:57.519
"The hour is near."

12:57.590 --> 12:59.217
"The call is coming."

12:59.292 --> 13:01.590
Let's give it a shot!

13:03.029 --> 13:05.122
Okay, let's get this
over with.

13:05.198 --> 13:07.598
It's way past my bedtime.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.760
Ready when you are,
Mr. Hibbing!

13:09.836 --> 13:10.825
All right.

13:10.903 --> 13:13.337
<i>Andy, cue the music</i>
<i>and the lights.</i>

13:13.439 --> 13:16.636
<i>Scene Three positions.</i>
<i>Let's see what you've got.</i>

13:17.877 --> 13:19.640
Here we go.

13:20.847 --> 13:22.872
Avast, you scurvy dogs.

13:22.949 --> 13:26.976
You came from the sea and
to the sea you shall return.

13:27.053 --> 13:29.180
<i>Pirate two, position five.</i>

13:30.857 --> 13:32.085
Okay.

13:33.960 --> 13:35.860
I go aloft, Captain.

13:35.928 --> 13:38.954
The height will afford me
a keener view.

13:43.302 --> 13:45.668
<i>Pirate three,</i>
<i>position four.</i>

13:45.738 --> 13:49.196
Your cutlass be sharper
than your mind, bilge rat.

13:51.010 --> 13:54.207
Can I do my lines from here?
I'm pooped.

13:54.747 --> 13:56.078
<i>Trigger B.</i>

13:58.851 --> 14:00.944
Whoa!
That's on my list.

14:19.872 --> 14:20.998
Ahoy.

14:24.777 --> 14:28.338
I can't believe he fired us
just for failing an audition.

14:28.414 --> 14:30.541
And breaking
the restaurant.

14:31.117 --> 14:32.778
Man, that's it for me.

14:32.852 --> 14:36.219
It's back to my parents'
basement and goodbye Ellen.

14:36.956 --> 14:38.617
I needed that job.

14:39.592 --> 14:41.184
Sure, we can get
some ice cream.

14:41.260 --> 14:42.989
Okay, double-fudge for me.

14:43.062 --> 14:46.031
Hi, Jacob.
Hello, Mr. Lewis.

14:46.599 --> 14:48.294
Heard about
your audition.

14:48.367 --> 14:52.167
I guess that makes you
"The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything."

14:54.640 --> 14:59.634
Well, tough luck.
Some guys got it and some guys don't.

15:00.413 --> 15:03.898
No wonder George Jr.
wants to hang out with us.

15:03.899 --> 15:04.975
His dad's a loser.

15:09.922 --> 15:12.789
I don't know what went wrong.
The old man...

15:12.892 --> 15:15.520
What went wrong is
that we listened to you!

15:15.595 --> 15:18.063
I should be at home
right now, watching TV

15:18.130 --> 15:20.690
as a happily employed
cabin boy.

15:21.601 --> 15:25.401
I guess guys like us will
never be more than cabin boys.

15:26.372 --> 15:27.930
Oh, come on, guys.

15:28.007 --> 15:31.841
Things look kind of bad right now,
but something will turn up.

15:42.722 --> 15:44.349
See what I mean?

15:45.057 --> 15:46.046
Free garbage.

15:46.125 --> 15:50.289
Oh, now we're headed someplace.
We've got a metal ball.

15:52.832 --> 15:54.925
Well, what is it?

15:55.201 --> 15:58.602
Well, it could be something
valuable, like a Russian satellite.

15:58.671 --> 16:00.161
Or maybe a bomb.

16:00.239 --> 16:02.332
I don't think
it's a bomb.

16:03.342 --> 16:04.639
Uh-oh.

16:04.710 --> 16:05.688
I told you it was a bomb.

16:05.689 --> 16:07.645
Chuck it in the river.
It think it might be a bomb.

16:07.713 --> 16:09.476
I don't think it's a bomb.
I think it's a bomb.

16:09.548 --> 16:11.836
It's a bomb!
It's a bomb for sure!

16:11.837 --> 16:13.143
I saw this on TV once.

16:13.219 --> 16:14.709
It's a bomb!

16:14.787 --> 16:16.812
I don't think
it's a bomb.

16:20.159 --> 16:21.217
What happened?

16:21.294 --> 16:22.761
It stopped blinking.

16:22.828 --> 16:25.058
I pushed the button.

16:25.131 --> 16:26.689
You did what?

16:40.513 --> 16:42.947
There's something
you don't see every day.

16:43.015 --> 16:46.746
So, we lost our jobs,
but we got a rowboat.

16:47.253 --> 16:48.914
So maybe it's a wash.

16:48.988 --> 16:51.786
Oh, okay.
I'll say, "Hey, Ellen.

16:51.857 --> 16:53.518
"The bad news is,
I got fired

16:53.592 --> 16:55.787
"and I'm living in
my parents' basement again.

16:55.861 --> 16:58.523
"The good news is,
I got a rowboat."

16:59.665 --> 17:01.360
It's so old.

17:01.434 --> 17:03.269
Well, you know the saying.

17:03.270 --> 17:06.303
"Give a man a fish and
he'll eat for a day.

17:06.372 --> 17:08.806
"Give a man a rowboat
and he'll..."

17:10.576 --> 17:12.544
You ruined my life!

17:17.049 --> 17:19.574
Hey, we could
have two rowboats.

17:19.652 --> 17:20.675
Wait!

17:45.911 --> 17:50.143
I'm thinking we should avoid
pushing any more buttons!

17:50.216 --> 17:51.979
I was going to
get us another rowboat.

17:52.051 --> 17:53.362
Well, you didn't!

17:53.363 --> 17:56.988
You didn't get us another rowboat!
You got us...

17:58.190 --> 17:59.657
You got us...

18:00.626 --> 18:02.093
Where are we?

18:02.628 --> 18:05.188
We appear
to be at sea.

18:07.666 --> 18:09.361
It's a lovely day.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.372
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:13.372 --> 18:15.704
Take me home!
Put me back!
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:15.704 --> 18:15.775
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:15.775 --> 18:17.140
I don't know how.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:17.140 --> 18:17.209
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:17.209 --> 18:20.474
Push another button!
You're the king of the buttons!
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:20.474 --> 18:20.546
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:20.546 --> 18:22.000
But it doesn't do anything if they
aren't blinking. They're not blinking.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:22.000 --> 18:24.983
But it doesn't do anything if they
aren't blinking. They're not blinking.

18:26.986 --> 18:28.510
See? Nothing.

18:28.587 --> 18:30.782
Hey, I think
I see something.

18:31.891 --> 18:34.826
It's a ship.
Let's row over and check it out.

18:36.061 --> 18:37.028
Row?

18:37.096 --> 18:38.448
Yeah. It's a rowboat.

18:38.449 --> 18:41.089
Each of you grab an
oar and start rowing.

18:42.535 --> 18:44.323
Hey, scoot over a little bit.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.665
We got to even out
the weight a little.

18:46.739 --> 18:47.763
You hold the skinny part.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.104
I wanna be the rudder.
Can I be the rudder?

18:50.176 --> 18:51.336
You're not
rowing together.

18:51.410 --> 18:52.536
No, you're going the wrong way.

18:52.611 --> 18:55.944
It's not a metaphor.
I'm talking literally.

18:58.584 --> 19:01.075
It's a girl.
Ahoy, there!

19:02.788 --> 19:04.756
Ahoy, strange seafarers.

19:05.157 --> 19:08.422
What brings you so far from
shore in such a modest vessel?

19:08.494 --> 19:10.291
Well, it's kind of funny.

19:10.362 --> 19:13.195
We found this rowboat
in the alley

19:13.265 --> 19:16.564
because there was a ball
in the garbage truck.

19:16.635 --> 19:17.693
This ball.

19:17.770 --> 19:19.067
The Helpseeker.

19:19.138 --> 19:21.072
Willory, they've come!

19:21.140 --> 19:22.732
Who's come, my lady?

19:22.808 --> 19:24.867
The heroes.
They're here!

19:25.444 --> 19:26.411
What'd she say?

19:26.479 --> 19:29.505
We've been waiting for you.
Quickly, come up.

19:32.318 --> 19:34.218
It's splendid
to meet you.

19:34.286 --> 19:37.084
I'm Eloise,
Princess of Monteria,

19:37.156 --> 19:39.420
and this is my butler,
Willory.

19:40.693 --> 19:45.460
We haven't much time. Pirates have
taken my brother, Prince Alexander.

19:45.531 --> 19:47.692
With my father, the King,
away in the west,

19:47.766 --> 19:51.065
it is imperative that we
mount a rescue immediately.

19:52.671 --> 19:54.138
So?

19:54.206 --> 19:56.174
Well, you're the heroes.

19:56.876 --> 19:58.366
Any questions?

20:01.013 --> 20:03.311
My lady,
may I have a word?

20:03.382 --> 20:04.713
We need to talk.

20:04.783 --> 20:06.944
Certainly.
One moment.

20:07.019 --> 20:08.987
We'll be
right with you.

20:09.455 --> 20:13.983
I mean no disrespect, but these
men hardly seem the heroic type.

20:14.393 --> 20:16.623
They're short,
rather pudgy,

20:16.695 --> 20:20.290
and for heaven's sake,
they were rowing around the ocean.

20:20.366 --> 20:22.698
What is going on here?

20:22.768 --> 20:24.326
She thinks we're, uh...

20:24.403 --> 20:25.631
Heroes.

20:25.704 --> 20:27.695
But, Willory,
they have the ball.

20:27.773 --> 20:32.233
Perhaps they plucked it from the
ocean or stole it from the real heroes.

20:32.311 --> 20:34.711
They could be pirates
themselves, you know.

20:34.780 --> 20:37.112
I mean,
look how they're dressed.

20:37.316 --> 20:38.408
So, what do we do?

20:38.484 --> 20:41.544
I say we have the asparagus
and the little princess

20:41.620 --> 20:44.214
turn this boat around
and take us home.

20:44.290 --> 20:46.060
Or we take this opportunity

20:46.061 --> 20:48.420
to do what we've
always wanted to do.

20:48.494 --> 20:49.483
Buy go-carts?

20:49.562 --> 20:51.223
No, be heroes.

20:51.664 --> 20:53.256
But we're cabin boys.

20:53.332 --> 20:55.630
They don't know that.
She called us heroes.

20:55.701 --> 20:56.998
You're kidding, right?

20:57.069 --> 20:59.299
Oh, come on,
how hard could it be?

20:59.371 --> 21:02.829
We sail around, we find the
prince, we go back home heroes.

21:02.908 --> 21:04.466
But how
can we trust them?

21:04.543 --> 21:06.909
Because
I trust my father.

21:06.979 --> 21:10.779
He created the Helpseeker for
one purpose, to bring help.

21:10.849 --> 21:13.374
And this is the help
it has brought.

21:14.987 --> 21:17.353
It's kind of nice
to be called a hero.

21:17.423 --> 21:19.084
Sure beats "loser."

21:19.158 --> 21:21.888
Well, gentlemen, are
you ready for adventure?

21:21.961 --> 21:23.622
Point the way!

21:23.696 --> 21:26.790
Oh, you're not pirates,
are you?

21:26.865 --> 21:28.890
Well, we're...

21:28.968 --> 21:30.663
We sure
aren't cabin boys.

21:30.736 --> 21:33.261
We're friendly pirates,
sort of.

21:33.839 --> 21:36.637
Oh. You don't rob
or pillage, do you?

21:36.709 --> 21:39.143
Oh, no, we don't do
any of that stuff.

21:39.211 --> 21:42.044
In fact, we don't do
anything at all.

21:42.114 --> 21:46.551
Back home, they actually call us
"The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything."

21:46.619 --> 21:48.314
That's right.

21:48.387 --> 21:49.854
How comforting.

21:49.922 --> 21:52.482
Well, then, there's
no time to spare.

21:52.558 --> 21:54.219
Great. I'll drive.

21:57.196 --> 21:59.323
We'll just give it some gas.

22:00.866 --> 22:02.163
How do you start this thing?

22:02.234 --> 22:06.261
What a kidder.
Elliot, let me take the wheel.

22:06.338 --> 22:09.739
You scramble up to the
yard and unfurl the topsail.

22:10.476 --> 22:11.534
Come again?

22:11.610 --> 22:12.770
Position three.

22:12.845 --> 22:14.813
Oh! Aye, aye, Captain.

22:20.619 --> 22:22.712
So, you guys got TiVo?

22:23.956 --> 22:26.390
Certainly.
Where are my manners?

22:26.458 --> 22:28.824
Willory, kindly bring
our friend some tea.

22:28.894 --> 22:30.521
No, TiVo.

22:30.596 --> 22:34.794
It's the recording thing with
the TV thing in the future.

22:37.202 --> 22:38.965
Tea would be lovely.

22:51.183 --> 22:53.310
The spies
are in place, sir.

23:09.768 --> 23:11.258
This is great.

23:12.871 --> 23:15.237
So, where we headed?

23:15.307 --> 23:19.903
We're coming up on a bunch
of islands. Real pointy ones.

23:19.978 --> 23:22.674
Yes, the Whipcrack Islands.

23:22.748 --> 23:26.878
These treacherous waters
shelter many a desperate pirate.

23:26.952 --> 23:30.945
A skilled captain able to sail
this maze will find, at its center,

23:31.023 --> 23:34.686
the Inn of Jolly Joe,
a popular pirate haunt.

23:35.494 --> 23:37.325
Perhaps we should
turn back.

23:37.396 --> 23:40.729
We cannot turn back.
Alexander is counting on us.

23:41.400 --> 23:43.732
Captain, are you
up to the task?

23:49.708 --> 23:52.541
Sure. Why, exactly,
do we need to go there?

23:53.212 --> 23:55.339
To find out
more about this.

23:57.750 --> 23:59.775
Hey, I've seen that on TV.

24:00.119 --> 24:03.384
You can cut a can with it
and still slice a tomato.

24:04.356 --> 24:07.587
This cutlass belongs to the
pirate who took my brother.

24:07.659 --> 24:09.286
If we find out
who the owner is,

24:09.361 --> 24:11.522
we'll be closer
to finding Alexander.

24:11.597 --> 24:14.157
My lady,
I don't think we're safe.

24:14.233 --> 24:16.531
These waters
teem with pirates,

24:16.602 --> 24:19.162
and you'd make
a handsome prize.

24:19.238 --> 24:23.004
We must do whatever it takes
to rescue my brother, Willory.

24:23.075 --> 24:26.010
Besides, we have our
heroes to watch over us.

24:26.445 --> 24:29.175
Does anyone know
where the bathroom is?

24:30.015 --> 24:31.039
Oh.

24:31.116 --> 24:34.779
Don't worry about a thing, Willory.
It's under control.

24:34.853 --> 24:39.051
Listen here, I don't know who
you are or where you came from,

24:39.124 --> 24:44.653
but I know what a hero is and you
three buffoons are most definitely not.

24:49.568 --> 24:51.433
How do we look,
First Mate Elliot?

24:51.503 --> 24:54.666
Looking good, Captain.
Steady as she goes.

25:04.950 --> 25:06.178
Huh?

25:09.421 --> 25:13.221
Captain, did you see
anything over there?

25:16.061 --> 25:17.858
Hey, I don't see anything.

25:18.964 --> 25:19.953
Hmm.

25:23.368 --> 25:24.562
Oh, no!

25:25.204 --> 25:27.035
What? Oh, dear!

25:27.105 --> 25:31.041
Drop your sails and
prepare to be boarded!

25:31.109 --> 25:33.236
Quickly, my lady,
you must hide.

25:33.312 --> 25:34.643
What do I do?

25:37.149 --> 25:38.639
We should drop our sails.

25:38.717 --> 25:39.775
What?

25:39.852 --> 25:40.860
Drop the sails!

25:40.861 --> 25:44.221
Get to the yard and undo the knots.
Position three!

25:44.857 --> 25:46.154
Okay.

25:46.225 --> 25:49.490
Perhaps you don't know
who you're dealing with.

25:49.561 --> 25:54.760
This be One-Eyed Louie,
terror of the Seven Seas.

25:54.833 --> 25:58.826
I'm giving you to the count
of five to drop your sails

25:58.904 --> 26:01.566
or we'll send you
to the bottom.

26:01.640 --> 26:04.074
I'm putting you on my list.

26:04.142 --> 26:06.042
Drop the sails!
Drop the sails!

26:06.111 --> 26:07.476
I don't know
how to untie them.

26:07.546 --> 26:08.570
Five...

26:08.647 --> 26:10.740
They're bowline knots.
Break the back!

26:10.816 --> 26:12.579
Back of what?
Which? Where?

26:12.651 --> 26:13.675
Four...

26:13.752 --> 26:16.812
The rabbit goes around the
tree twice, then down the hole.

26:16.889 --> 26:18.823
Get the rabbit
out of the hole!

26:18.891 --> 26:20.358
What rabbit?

26:20.425 --> 26:21.824
Three...

26:21.894 --> 26:24.226
<i>Looking for the bathroom</i>

26:24.296 --> 26:28.062
Oh! How quaint.
The princess has a Powder Room!

26:29.434 --> 26:31.732
Locked. All right,
where's the key?

26:31.803 --> 26:33.771
Two...
I'm not getting it.

26:33.839 --> 26:36.171
The rabbit,
the middle, the hole!

26:36.775 --> 26:39.539
Here, key, key, key!

26:39.611 --> 26:41.069
Oh! Look, there you are.

26:41.070 --> 26:43.741
On a big ring,
just like at the gas station.

26:43.815 --> 26:45.248
One.

26:45.317 --> 26:48.946
Come on.
I got to go!

27:12.678 --> 27:16.739
What a marvelous strategy,
pretending you couldn't untie a knot

27:16.815 --> 27:19.010
while Sedgewick crept
down to the gun deck.

27:19.084 --> 27:21.143
What cunning!
What bravery!

27:21.219 --> 27:24.848
Oh, it was nothing. Really.

27:24.923 --> 27:27.084
I told you
they were heroes.

27:37.469 --> 27:40.905
I don't have to
go to the bathroom no more!

27:45.811 --> 27:48.905
Get a move on.
Hurry it up!

27:51.049 --> 27:53.540
Welcome to
my kingdom, Prince.

27:54.152 --> 27:57.383
It's not quite as homely
as your father's,

27:58.090 --> 28:00.388
but it's great
for entertaining.

28:00.525 --> 28:01.822
Whoa!

28:01.893 --> 28:03.724
Have fun!

28:03.795 --> 28:07.196
You can't hide, Robert.
My father will send help.

28:07.265 --> 28:10.166
Oh, I would enjoy that.

28:10.235 --> 28:11.896
All are welcome.

28:15.107 --> 28:16.972
Watch your step.

28:28.954 --> 28:30.888
Any sign
of the inn yet?

28:31.156 --> 28:32.248
Anything?

28:32.324 --> 28:33.848
Not yet.

28:33.925 --> 28:38.055
My father will be very pleased
that his Helpseeker found you all.

28:38.130 --> 28:39.961
You love your dad
a lot, huh?

28:40.032 --> 28:42.796
Oh, yes.
He's a wonderful king.

28:43.235 --> 28:48.832
Wise, brave, but he always finds
time for me, his little Eloise.

28:49.174 --> 28:50.766
Oh, that's great.

28:50.842 --> 28:54.073
I'd figure a king would be
kind of busy most of the time.

28:54.146 --> 28:57.513
Oh, but he's much more
than just an ordinary king.

28:59.217 --> 29:00.844
Do you have children?

29:00.919 --> 29:04.855
Sure do. George Jr.
and Lucy. Great kids.

29:04.923 --> 29:08.620
I'm sure they know how lucky
they are. A hero for a father!

29:12.330 --> 29:14.423
I see something!

29:14.499 --> 29:16.899
It looks like an inn
or something.

29:25.243 --> 29:27.108
I'm asking again,
my lady,

29:27.179 --> 29:30.273
for your own safety,
please return to the ship.

29:31.249 --> 29:35.583
You are a princess, and this inn
is full of treacherous pirates!

29:35.654 --> 29:37.138
Yes, thank you, Willory.

29:37.139 --> 29:39.488
But my brother's
life may be at stake.

29:40.158 --> 29:42.820
Even princesses
can do what's right.

29:43.795 --> 29:45.558
Yes, of course.

29:51.269 --> 29:53.703
You'll need to befriend
a group of pirates,

29:53.772 --> 29:56.639
then ask them about the
owner of this cutlass.

29:56.708 --> 29:57.800
Right.

29:57.876 --> 30:01.039
And, for heaven's sake,
keep your wits about you.

30:01.113 --> 30:03.638
These are treacherous men.

30:03.715 --> 30:04.875
Join in!

30:05.646 --> 30:08.386
<i>Argh, argh, argh, argh, argh,</i>
<i>argh, argh, argh, argh, argh</i>

30:08.453 --> 30:11.650
<i>Argh, argh, argh, argh, argh,</i>
<i>argh, argh, argh!</i>

30:15.293 --> 30:16.817
<i>Grab your root beer,</i>
<i>hold it high!</i>

30:16.895 --> 30:18.487
<i>Whack your shipmate</i>
<i>in the eye!</i>

30:18.563 --> 30:20.428
<i>Yank his hair</i>
<i>and break his nose!</i>

30:20.499 --> 30:22.091
<i>Watch your back,</i>
<i>it's Jolly Joe's!</i>

30:22.167 --> 30:23.794
<i>Grab your root beer,</i>
<i>hold it high!</i>

30:23.869 --> 30:25.837
<i>Whack your shipmate</i>
<i>in the eye!</i>

30:25.904 --> 30:27.496
<i>Yank his hair</i>
<i>and break his nose!</i>

30:27.572 --> 30:29.267
<i>Watch your back,</i>
<i>it's Jolly Joe's!</i>

30:29.341 --> 30:30.740
<i>Argh, argh, argh, argh, argh</i>

30:30.809 --> 30:32.699
<i>Argh, argh, argh, argh, argh</i>

30:32.700 --> 30:35.075
You've got it
now! Keep it up, lads!

30:36.114 --> 30:39.413
<i>Swing your shipmate, promenade</i>
<i>Smack him with a rusty blade</i>

30:39.484 --> 30:40.986
<i>Spin around and do-si-do</i>

30:40.987 --> 30:43.215
<i>Watch your step,</i>
<i>it's Jolly Joe's</i>

30:43.288 --> 30:46.621
<i>Swing your shipmate, promenade</i>
<i>Smack him with a rusty blade</i>

30:46.691 --> 30:48.019
<i>Spin around and do-si-do</i>

30:48.020 --> 30:49.990
<i>Watch your step,</i>
<i>it's Jolly Joe's</i>

30:50.061 --> 30:51.392
<i>Argh, argh, argh, argh, argh</i>

30:51.463 --> 30:52.515
<i>Argh, argh, argh, argh, argh</i>

30:52.516 --> 30:53.658
Watch your
backs, scalawagons!

30:53.732 --> 30:56.929
<i>Argh, argh, argh, argh, argh</i>

30:57.002 --> 31:00.301
<i>Pirates do as pirates please</i>

31:00.372 --> 31:03.432
<i>We're terrors</i>
<i>of the Seven Seas</i>

31:03.508 --> 31:07.308
<i>And when we've pillaged</i>
<i>all our foes</i>

31:07.379 --> 31:14.342
<i>There ain't no place</i>
<i>like Jolly Joe's!</i>

31:14.619 --> 31:18.111
<i>Grab a keg of ginger ale</i>
<i>Hop up on a wooden pail</i>

31:18.190 --> 31:19.885
<i>Drop it on</i>
<i>your shipmate's toes!</i>

31:19.958 --> 31:20.947
Oh!

31:21.026 --> 31:25.861
<i>There ain't no place</i>
<i>like Jolly Joe's!</i>

31:25.931 --> 31:27.660
<i>Argh, argh, argh, argh, argh</i>

31:27.732 --> 31:30.997
<i>Argh, argh, argh, argh, argh,</i>
<i>argh, argh, argh, argh, argh</i>

31:31.069 --> 31:32.764
Argh, great! Argh!

31:35.106 --> 31:38.473
They sound jolly, but
they don't look so jolly.

31:40.912 --> 31:42.675
Okay, boys,
deal them up.

31:42.747 --> 31:44.840
That deck's got
to be swabbed.

31:44.916 --> 31:49.410
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I was wondering if you could,

31:49.854 --> 31:51.788
if you could tell me...

31:54.526 --> 31:57.927
What's the matter there?
Parrot got your tongue?

31:59.698 --> 32:01.165
Well, I...

32:01.233 --> 32:06.034
He looks like a captain,
but he talks like a cabin boy!

32:11.576 --> 32:14.374
It isn't going to work.
Let's just go.

32:14.446 --> 32:18.075
Let me try. You got to know
how to talk to these guys.

32:18.883 --> 32:22.114
Argh!
'Twas a fine day at sea today.

32:22.187 --> 32:26.556
Took a 12-gun brigantine
and 10,000 pieces of eight.

32:26.625 --> 32:29.822
Argh! Well, we took
an 18-gun sloop

32:29.894 --> 32:32.294
and 20,000 pieces
of eight.

32:32.364 --> 32:34.559
Aye, but did you
show no mercy?

32:34.633 --> 32:35.622
Not a bit!

32:35.700 --> 32:37.463
Were you cruel and unusual?

32:37.535 --> 32:39.025
The cruelest!

32:39.104 --> 32:42.767
Well, me hearties,
that was a fine day!

32:44.276 --> 32:46.437
Grab a chair,
and join the game!

32:46.511 --> 32:47.603
All right!

32:47.679 --> 32:50.614
Come on in. Serve them up,
pour them up, pull them up.

32:50.682 --> 32:54.846
Ahem! By the way, mateys,
have any of you seen this?

33:00.859 --> 33:03.327
Is that a yes or a no?

33:07.232 --> 33:09.029
Aye, lad.

33:10.568 --> 33:12.763
The cutlass
belongs to Robert.

33:12.837 --> 33:14.634
Robert the Terrible.

33:15.907 --> 33:17.374
My uncle!

33:17.442 --> 33:20.138
You have his cutlass,
but you're not he.

33:20.211 --> 33:23.180
The others were fooled,
but I know better.

33:23.248 --> 33:25.443
You know where we
could find this fellow?

33:25.517 --> 33:27.542
His fortress is hidden.

33:27.619 --> 33:31.487
But I've heard tell of an island,
past the Rocks of Malabar.

33:32.123 --> 33:34.182
On that island, a cave.

33:34.259 --> 33:38.821
And in that cave, the clues
to finding his secret lair.

33:39.397 --> 33:42.059
Not that I'd go
looking for it.

33:42.133 --> 33:43.259
And why shouldn't they?

33:43.335 --> 33:46.634
They don't call him
"Robert the Terrible" for nothing.

33:46.705 --> 33:51.608
He's the King's own brother,
but he's as bad as the King is good.

33:51.676 --> 33:54.201
Tried to take the throne
by force, he did.

33:54.279 --> 33:58.181
And, for his treachery,
was banished from Monteria.

33:58.249 --> 33:59.773
So he's a little nasty.

33:59.851 --> 34:01.148
A little?

34:01.219 --> 34:04.245
Aren't you
up for a little adventure?

34:04.322 --> 34:07.519
I hear tell, locked
deep in his fortress,

34:07.592 --> 34:09.753
he's harnessed
the mechanical arts,

34:09.828 --> 34:11.795
to make himself
stronger than the King.

34:11.862 --> 34:15.025
With terrible
iron legs and arms.

34:15.100 --> 34:16.260
Not that terrible.

34:16.333 --> 34:19.360
His iron claw
can crack a coconut!

34:19.437 --> 34:21.042
Stop trying to scare them.

34:21.043 --> 34:24.067
Story says he's waiting
for the King to step away,

34:24.141 --> 34:27.373
just long enough to grab
his beloved children

34:27.445 --> 34:30.572
and take the throne
for his own.

34:30.648 --> 34:33.411
So, what would
he do with them?

34:33.485 --> 34:37.545
For Robert to claim the throne,
they must be gone!

34:37.621 --> 34:39.418
On vacation?

34:39.591 --> 34:41.217
Princess Eloise?

34:46.231 --> 34:48.096
So, what would he do
with someone

34:48.166 --> 34:50.360
who was helping
the Prince and Princess?

34:50.435 --> 34:55.338
A cucumber slices much
more easily than a coconut.

35:01.413 --> 35:03.210
Oh, for Pete's sake.

35:03.982 --> 35:07.042
Okay, that's enough adventure
for this gourd.

35:07.118 --> 35:10.383
Clearing tables is really
kind of fun when you think about it.

35:10.455 --> 35:12.685
Don't leave
without me!

35:12.757 --> 35:15.885
Which way would be home?

35:15.960 --> 35:19.157
George! Sedgewick! Elliot!
Where are you going?

35:19.230 --> 35:21.721
We must sail
for the island at once!

35:21.800 --> 35:25.167
Unless, of course, our
heroes are giving up.

35:25.236 --> 35:26.794
Oh, no.

35:26.871 --> 35:30.864
It's just that, you know,
heroes can be very busy.

35:30.942 --> 35:33.740
And now that this situation
is under control,

35:33.812 --> 35:37.009
we've been beckoned
to another crisis.

35:37.582 --> 35:38.640
Somewhere else.

35:38.716 --> 35:40.183
You must be mistaken.

35:40.251 --> 35:42.014
The Helpseeker
brought you here,

35:42.086 --> 35:44.577
and only the Helpseeker
can send you back.

35:44.656 --> 35:46.419
According to
my father's notes,

35:46.491 --> 35:50.018
the red button brings help,
and the blue button sends you home.

35:50.094 --> 35:52.961
But I don't believe it will light
until your work here is done.

35:53.031 --> 35:54.555
I want to go home!

35:54.632 --> 35:58.591
Just get me back to 1972.
I'll walk from there.

35:58.670 --> 36:01.662
I don't understand.
You're our heroes!

36:01.739 --> 36:05.004
Brave as lions
and cunning as foxes.

36:05.743 --> 36:07.643
Are you the lion?
'Cause I'm not the lion.

36:07.712 --> 36:11.307
No, you're the chicken.
He's the spineless sea sponge.

36:11.382 --> 36:12.406
Who are you?

36:12.484 --> 36:16.420
I don't know. I'm like
a sleepy little panda.

36:16.488 --> 36:18.854
My father brought you here
for a reason,

36:18.923 --> 36:21.187
and your work here
is not done.

36:32.003 --> 36:34.164
All right, here are
the Rocks of Malabar.

36:34.239 --> 36:36.764
But look! There's
no island anywhere.

36:37.976 --> 36:41.139
But Jolly Joe said there's
an island past the rocks.

36:41.212 --> 36:43.373
Well, you're
the King's heroes.

36:43.448 --> 36:46.076
I'll leave the
interpretation up to you.

36:46.718 --> 36:47.878
Ta-ta!

36:48.753 --> 36:50.118
I don't know
about you,

36:50.188 --> 36:53.919
but if I bump into that Robert guy,
I'm going to wet myself.

36:53.992 --> 36:58.326
Well, let's at least go look.
It won't be that hard.

36:58.396 --> 37:02.765
We sail to the Rocks, look
around a little, and then go home.

37:02.834 --> 37:07.533
Our work will be done.
No island, nothing more we can do.

37:08.740 --> 37:09.764
I don't know.

37:09.841 --> 37:10.000
Well, what if
the map is wrong?

37:22.387 --> 37:23.684
Great plan, George.

37:23.755 --> 37:27.452
What he lacks in spine,
he makes up for in brain.

37:27.525 --> 37:30.653
<i>Raise the mast</i>
<i>on the</i> Steadfast!

37:31.095 --> 37:33.529
<i>Swifter than</i>

37:33.865 --> 37:36.095
<i>Sailing an uncharted</i>
<i>sea course</i>

37:36.167 --> 37:38.294
<i>Who could survive</i>
<i>such a dangerous mission</i>

37:38.369 --> 37:41.099
<i>Alongside pirates</i>
<i>with zero ambition?</i>

37:41.172 --> 37:44.039
<i>We got the coconuts poured</i>

37:44.108 --> 37:46.975
<i>We dropped the hooks overboard</i>

37:47.045 --> 37:49.912
<i>And if you get</i>
<i>a little seasick</i>

37:49.981 --> 37:52.245
<i>We play the haddock</i>
<i>for a hat trick</i>

37:52.884 --> 37:54.818
<i>We got the hammocks</i>
<i>on the main deck</i>

37:54.886 --> 37:55.944
<i>Swingin' low</i>

37:56.020 --> 37:57.681

<i>Flighty as a bird</i>

38:15.239 --> 38:18.299
<i>Yo, I'm seeing no heroes</i>

38:22.113 --> 38:24.274
<i>We're on a limbo craze</i>

38:24.349 --> 38:27.147
<i>It's a relic</i>
<i>from our limber days</i>

38:27.218 --> 38:30.085
<i>Now we're stuck</i>
<i>inside the limbo zone</i>

38:30.154 --> 38:31.701
<i>That's where the pirates go</i>

38:31.702 --> 38:34.022

<i>Yo, I'm seeing no heroes</i>

38:57.248 --> 38:59.808
<i>We're on the bad mood swing</i>

39:00.118 --> 39:03.019
<i>We haven't done one thing</i>

39:03.087 --> 39:05.715
<i>Not even the minimum</i>

39:06.024 --> 39:08.891

39:10.928 --> 39:11.952

39:13.665 --> 39:14.757

39:14.832 --> 39:16.766

39:16.834 --> 39:17.858
<i>Rings the chime</i>

39:28.312 --> 39:31.329
<i>Steady as a rock</i>
<i>I know it's a shock</i>

39:31.330 --> 39:32.749
<i>Yo, let's be a hero</i>

39:32.817 --> 39:34.114
<i>Go, hero</i>

39:34.185 --> 39:36.983
<i>Standing in the gap</i>
<i>Taking up the slack</i>

39:36.984 --> 39:38.485
<i>Following the King's map</i>

39:38.556 --> 39:39.921
<i>Go, hero</i>

39:39.991 --> 39:42.824
<i>Steady at the wheel</i>
<i>Keep an even keel</i>

39:42.894 --> 39:45.795
<i>Yo, there be the King's heroes</i>

39:59.210 --> 40:01.770
The Rocks of Malabar!

40:01.846 --> 40:04.781
Well, that's it.
No island around here.

40:04.849 --> 40:05.838
Time to go home.

40:05.917 --> 40:10.320
Fellows, fellows!
Let us not give up so easily.

40:10.388 --> 40:12.913
The island
may still lie ahead.

40:26.871 --> 40:29.101
What is that?

40:29.173 --> 40:32.336
<i>El Remolino,</i>
the great whirlpool!

40:32.410 --> 40:36.437
But no pirate will sail beyond the
Rocks of Malabar for fear of it.

40:36.514 --> 40:40.644
I thought it was pirate
legend, but there it is.

40:40.718 --> 40:42.515
Okay,
time to go home.

40:42.587 --> 40:44.384
No islands out here.

40:46.491 --> 40:49.255
No, we're going to
keep going.

40:50.294 --> 40:52.888
But didn't you hear him?
It's a giant whirlpool!

40:52.964 --> 40:55.228
"Captain George's
Death Cruise,"

40:55.299 --> 40:58.700
brought to you by
George, the Crazy Grape.

40:58.770 --> 41:01.136
I thought
you were on our side.

41:01.205 --> 41:02.672
Thank you, George.

41:02.740 --> 41:05.072
Might be
a giant whirlpool.

41:05.143 --> 41:08.374
Might not be.
Let's hold our course!

41:12.183 --> 41:16.483
That whirlpool holds
nothing but our own demise!

41:16.554 --> 41:18.215
Oh, really?

41:22.693 --> 41:23.990
The island!

41:24.061 --> 41:25.756
Huh. How about that?

41:25.830 --> 41:27.457
What?
How could...

41:27.532 --> 41:28.931
It's a sea mirage.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.629
Water droplets in the air
reflecting the sky so perfectly

41:32.703 --> 41:34.933
they block the island
from view.

41:36.274 --> 41:37.935
Weather Channel.

41:44.448 --> 41:47.906
Right on time.

41:48.686 --> 41:51.814
And look
who they left behind.

42:05.636 --> 42:07.900
Do you think there are
snakes on this island?

42:07.972 --> 42:09.872
'Cause snakes
are on my list.

42:09.941 --> 42:13.001
Oh, I'm sure there are snakes.
Big ones, too.

42:13.077 --> 42:14.977
And spiders
and bears.

42:15.046 --> 42:16.070
Huh?

42:16.147 --> 42:20.049
Of course, the real question
is why are we on this island?

42:20.117 --> 42:21.311
I don't follow you.

42:21.385 --> 42:22.477
We had a plan!

42:22.553 --> 42:25.954
Sail to the Rocks,
don't find the island, go home!

42:26.023 --> 42:27.752
Which part eluded you?

42:27.825 --> 42:29.554
It was a sea mirage!

42:29.627 --> 42:32.460
You knew that,
but we didn't need to know that.

42:32.530 --> 42:33.827
It's an adventure.

42:33.898 --> 42:35.866
I don't want
any more adventure!

42:35.933 --> 42:38.766
I should be home on the couch
right now, eating cheese curls

42:38.836 --> 42:40.201
and watching
<i>The Love Boat!</i>

42:40.271 --> 42:42.899
Instead, I'm stuck here
with Captain Weather Channel

42:42.974 --> 42:46.569
on my way to be sliced and
diced by Edward Scissorhands!

42:47.945 --> 42:50.505
Look, I don't know
what I'm doing here.

42:50.581 --> 42:52.947
I'm just trying
to help Eloise.

42:53.017 --> 42:55.485
Let's just get the clues
for the Princess.

42:55.553 --> 42:58.078
Maybe then we can go home.

42:58.155 --> 43:01.989
Now, if I were a cave,
where would I be?

43:02.059 --> 43:03.720
Right about there.

43:11.402 --> 43:14.769
Dark, creepy caves
are on my list.

43:14.839 --> 43:16.602
Sedgewick,
look for the clues.

43:16.674 --> 43:19.802
Oh, yeah. To bring me
even closer to my death.

43:24.682 --> 43:27.845
So, what's wrong
with our boat?

43:27.919 --> 43:31.355
We can't sneak up on them
in a pirate boat, you ninny.

43:32.924 --> 43:34.949
So, what do
they look like?

43:35.026 --> 43:36.653
What?
The clues.

43:36.727 --> 43:37.751
I don't know.

43:37.828 --> 43:41.696
Maybe a map or a model of
the world carved out of rock.

43:41.766 --> 43:43.393
Or maybe a billboard.

43:43.467 --> 43:45.526
Not likely.
Too obvious.

43:45.603 --> 43:47.662
No, really.
A billboard.

43:47.738 --> 43:48.966
What?

43:52.610 --> 43:55.545
"If a sailor
were to look for me,

43:55.613 --> 43:58.377
"the East
is where he'd start.

43:58.449 --> 44:01.680
"He'd reach
the Isle of Walking Rocks

44:01.752 --> 44:04.880
"and the Clapping Pass
would part.

44:04.956 --> 44:08.084
"Then gaze with pride
upon my keep,

44:08.159 --> 44:10.423
"not found on any chart,

44:10.494 --> 44:13.895
"till he would spy
my steely eye

44:13.965 --> 44:16.559
"and fear
would stop his heart."

44:17.802 --> 44:18.826
Ooh.

44:18.903 --> 44:21.770
"Copyright Robert the Terrible.
All rights reserved."

44:21.839 --> 44:24.603
Oh, yeah. That sounds
like fun and all,

44:24.675 --> 44:29.339
but I'd kind of like to keep my heart
going, if it's all the same to you.

44:29.413 --> 44:32.314
So, what do we got?
We head East to...

44:32.383 --> 44:36.877
The Isle of Walking Rocks
and the Clapping Pass.

44:36.954 --> 44:39.354
And that's where
this Robert guy hangs out.

44:39.423 --> 44:42.153
And then something
about cardiac arrest.

44:43.294 --> 44:48.322
I don't know, call me crazy, but maybe
our senses of fun are a little bit

44:49.500 --> 44:50.990
different.

44:51.068 --> 44:52.433
Holy mackerel.

44:52.503 --> 44:54.437
Holy mackerel!

44:54.505 --> 44:55.995
What? What is it?
What? What is it?

44:56.073 --> 44:57.097
Pieces of eight?

44:57.174 --> 44:58.573
Spanish gold?

44:58.642 --> 45:00.200
Even better.

45:02.613 --> 45:04.376
Cheese curls!

45:04.448 --> 45:06.143
What?
Cheese curls.

45:06.217 --> 45:09.050
Thousands of them.
Maybe millions!

45:09.120 --> 45:12.021
Well, grab a few and
let's get back to the boat.

45:12.089 --> 45:14.455
I'm not going
back to the boat.

45:16.794 --> 45:19.592
What do you mean you're
not going back to the boat?

45:19.663 --> 45:22.393
The way I see it,
I have two choices.

45:22.466 --> 45:25.094
Go back to the boat and
continue our little adventure

45:25.169 --> 45:27.729
until we all die
in terrible ways,

45:27.805 --> 45:30.831
or stay on this island
and frolic in the sun

45:30.908 --> 45:34.173
with a lifetime supply
of my favorite snack food.

45:34.245 --> 45:36.440
Now, I'm no
Albert Einstein,

45:36.514 --> 45:38.846
but I'm thinking the
choice is pretty clear.

45:38.916 --> 45:42.875
But, the Princess, she
thinks we're heroes.

45:42.953 --> 45:44.887
Well, she's wrong.

45:44.955 --> 45:49.324
Heroes are tall and strong and brave
and handsome, like Sir Frederick.

45:49.393 --> 45:51.657
We aren't any
of those things.

45:52.329 --> 45:54.923
When you're done pretending,
come on back.

45:54.999 --> 45:57.433
I'll save you
a few cheese curls.

45:59.837 --> 46:02.237
Fine.
Have it your way.

46:02.306 --> 46:04.069
I will. Thank you.

46:04.141 --> 46:05.904
You're not welcome.

46:14.718 --> 46:18.279
Where do I start?
How about you, my little friend?

46:24.095 --> 46:25.187
What?

46:29.400 --> 46:32.267
Hey, hey, hey, fellas?

46:34.138 --> 46:35.662
Oh, what does he know?

46:35.739 --> 46:40.733
I know we're not real heroes
but we're not doing so bad.

46:40.811 --> 46:43.109
Let's just
get back to the boat.

46:44.682 --> 46:46.309
Where is she going?

46:46.383 --> 46:47.782
She's sailing away.

46:47.852 --> 46:49.786
But the clues!

46:49.854 --> 46:52.254
Maybe she didn't
need them after all.

46:53.491 --> 46:54.651
Are you beeping?

46:54.725 --> 46:56.158
It's my bag.

46:56.660 --> 46:59.823
The ball. It's the blue button!
We can go home now.

46:59.897 --> 47:02.229
What? That doesn't
make any sense.

47:02.299 --> 47:04.631
It means
our work is done.

47:04.702 --> 47:06.602
Where's the rowboat?

47:06.670 --> 47:10.265
But the ball! It's blinking!
We can go home.

47:10.341 --> 47:13.640
Hold on a sec.
How long has that been here?

47:16.180 --> 47:19.377
It's one of Robert's boats.
But where are the men?

47:20.417 --> 47:23.853
The ball!
It's blinking!

47:27.391 --> 47:29.655
Something ain't right.

47:31.929 --> 47:34.557
They've got the Princess!
We got to help her!

47:34.632 --> 47:35.894
Come on!

47:42.973 --> 47:44.531
Listen,
when the ball blinks,

47:44.608 --> 47:46.667
our work is done
and we can go home.

47:46.744 --> 47:50.305
Don't you want to go home?
Don't you want to see your kids?

47:50.381 --> 47:52.406
Sure I want to
see my kids.

47:53.017 --> 47:56.180
But I also want them
to want to see me.

47:56.253 --> 47:59.188
You know, maybe the reason
they don't look up to me

47:59.256 --> 48:03.215
is because I haven't given them
something worth looking up to.

48:03.294 --> 48:04.727
But the ball.

48:04.795 --> 48:08.390
Hey, that ball thought
we were heroes.

48:08.465 --> 48:12.231
It was wrong about that.
It could be wrong about this, too.

48:12.870 --> 48:14.337
Look, Elliot.

48:15.072 --> 48:18.041
If you want to go home,
you can go home.

48:18.676 --> 48:22.168
But Eloise needs me.
And I need to do what's right.

48:37.861 --> 48:39.453
Let's go save a princess!

48:39.530 --> 48:41.259
Help is on the way!

48:41.966 --> 48:44.025
Help!

48:48.973 --> 48:51.999
What kind of a crazy
B movie am I in?

48:52.076 --> 48:55.136
<i>Attack Of</i>
<i>The Killer Cheesecurls?</i>

48:55.212 --> 48:57.703
Okay, guys.
Let's be reasonable.

48:58.682 --> 49:00.547
I wasn't really
going to eat you,

49:00.618 --> 49:03.416
but you were impersonating
a snack food!

49:09.093 --> 49:10.390
Okay, we're off!

49:10.461 --> 49:12.895
I don't think we can
catch up with them.

49:12.963 --> 49:16.660
I think you're right. Then we'll
just have to follow the clues.

49:16.734 --> 49:17.758
The clues?

49:17.835 --> 49:19.234
Yeah, from the billboard.

49:19.303 --> 49:22.272
Head East to the Island
of Walking Rocks.

49:22.339 --> 49:23.966
You think
that's a good idea?

49:24.041 --> 49:26.134
No, but I haven't got
a better one.

49:26.210 --> 49:27.905
East it is!

49:30.180 --> 49:31.807
The other east.

49:31.882 --> 49:33.713
East it is!

49:39.723 --> 49:41.623
My sacroiliac.

49:42.293 --> 49:44.887
At least I lost
those cheese curls.

49:48.799 --> 49:50.384
They're like roaches!

49:50.385 --> 49:53.327
Sick, demented,
cheese-flavored roaches!

49:54.004 --> 49:55.767
They stuck me here
on purpose.

49:55.839 --> 49:59.969
I bet George knew about those little
things from the Weather Channel, too.

50:00.044 --> 50:02.103
He's trying to kill me.

50:11.322 --> 50:14.155
I can't climb that.
It's too far.

50:15.192 --> 50:16.853
It isn't worth it.

50:18.996 --> 50:21.692
Eaten by his own
favorite snack food.

50:22.666 --> 50:26.466
Could be worse. I could be
eaten by something I don't like.

50:28.138 --> 50:29.469
I give up.

50:29.907 --> 50:31.636
It was a good life.

50:31.709 --> 50:35.304
At least that one day,
from about 2:00 to 2:30.

50:37.281 --> 50:38.748
Hey!

50:38.816 --> 50:41.580
Where did...
That's mine!

50:43.420 --> 50:44.580
Ellen.

50:45.389 --> 50:47.823
I bet she'd want me
to come back.

50:51.995 --> 50:53.087
What?

50:54.331 --> 50:55.662
The light.

50:56.900 --> 51:00.097
The crab
will show me the light.

51:01.472 --> 51:05.374
Maybe I can't do it,
but maybe I can!

51:09.713 --> 51:12.511
And this is the day
to find out!

51:55.826 --> 51:59.318
Sorry, boys!
Gourd is off the menu!

52:11.775 --> 52:13.572
What do you want, Robert?

52:13.644 --> 52:17.603
Isn't it obvious?
I want the throne, the crown!

52:18.348 --> 52:21.215
For years I watched
my "noble" brother

52:21.285 --> 52:27.121
use his power for the benefit of every
family in Monteria except our own!

52:27.191 --> 52:29.853
Feed the poor,
help the sick.

52:29.927 --> 52:32.157
The widows,
the orphans,

52:32.229 --> 52:33.856
blah, blah, blah.

52:33.931 --> 52:36.365
My father is a good
and generous King.

52:36.433 --> 52:37.866
Indeed.

52:37.935 --> 52:42.338
He took Monteria's wealth,
our wealth, my wealth,

52:42.406 --> 52:45.375
and squandered it
on strangers. Peasants!

52:46.276 --> 52:52.010
When the crown is mine, I can once
again enjoy the benefits of royalty.

52:52.483 --> 52:56.476
You're not strong enough to take
the crown from my father's head.

52:56.553 --> 52:57.447
Perhaps not.

52:57.448 --> 53:00.649
But with you and your
sister out of the way,

53:00.724 --> 53:03.215
I'll be next in line
for the throne.

53:03.894 --> 53:08.627
And if your father should have
an unfortunate accident...

53:08.966 --> 53:10.194
What do you mean?

53:10.267 --> 53:12.792
Ambition is
the mother of invention.

53:13.837 --> 53:17.136
A little something I
worked up during my exile.

53:18.308 --> 53:20.276
Amazing what
black powder can do,

53:20.344 --> 53:22.437
floating just beneath
the surface.

53:22.513 --> 53:24.504
A little demonstration.

53:29.386 --> 53:32.253
Off you go,
Your Highness.

53:41.665 --> 53:44.190
Of course, I can't just leave
them in the harbor waiting,

53:44.268 --> 53:46.133
or I'll blow up
my own ships.

53:46.203 --> 53:50.867
So I need to know something.
When is the King returning?

53:50.941 --> 53:51.965
He didn't say.

53:52.042 --> 53:55.842
But even if he had, I'd give
my own life before I'd tell you!

53:56.413 --> 53:58.745
But would you give
your sister's?

54:00.384 --> 54:01.715
Alexander!

54:01.785 --> 54:05.380
Surely you must know when
your father is returning!

54:05.455 --> 54:09.016
If you can manage to remember,

54:09.092 --> 54:12.084
I might consider
sparing the two of you.

54:20.137 --> 54:22.662
You have two hours
to think it over.

54:25.108 --> 54:28.043
Otherwise,
when the sand runs out,

54:28.745 --> 54:31.737
so do the Prince
and Princess.

54:38.021 --> 54:39.921
Put them in their cell.

54:42.559 --> 54:45.426
Oh, Father,
who can help us now?

54:48.012 --> 54:50.298
<i>Papa's got a gumball, Nellie</i>
<i>Papa's got a gumball, Sue</i>

54:50.367 --> 54:51.605
<i>Papa's got a gumball, Nellie</i>

54:51.606 --> 54:53.268
<i>I think I'll blow</i>
<i>a bubble for you</i>

54:53.337 --> 54:55.271
<i>Oh, Papa's got</i>
<i>a pork chop, Nellie,</i>

54:55.272 --> 54:56.431
<i>Papa's got a pork chop...</i>

54:56.506 --> 54:57.768
Will you stop that?

54:57.841 --> 54:59.900
What? It's a good song.
Don't you like it?

54:59.977 --> 55:03.413
After the 32nd verse,
it grates.

55:03.480 --> 55:05.311
Besides,
it's making me hungry.

55:05.382 --> 55:06.291
Look at this.

55:06.292 --> 55:09.716
I suppose Robert's fortress
is beyond those peaks.

55:10.220 --> 55:12.484
But there's supposed
to be a pass.

55:12.556 --> 55:14.547
The Clapping Pass, right?

55:14.625 --> 55:17.150
Right.
I don't see anything.

55:17.227 --> 55:20.458
You think that's the Island
of Walking Rocks?

55:20.530 --> 55:24.466
It's got rocks, but they don't
appear to be going anywhere.

55:24.534 --> 55:26.559
Maybe it's poetic license.

55:31.942 --> 55:35.400
I'm going to look for the pass.
You hang out here.

55:49.192 --> 55:51.092
Walking rocks.

55:51.161 --> 55:53.527
<i>Look at us,</i>
<i>we're walking rocks</i>

55:53.597 --> 55:55.895
<i>We don't wear</i>
<i>any shoes or socks</i>

55:55.966 --> 55:57.297
La-la-la-la-la

56:07.477 --> 56:08.910
George?

56:08.979 --> 56:10.139
George!

56:17.187 --> 56:20.247
That must lead to the fortress.
Hey, Elliot!

56:20.323 --> 56:22.450
The rocks!

56:22.993 --> 56:24.119
Huh?

56:36.139 --> 56:37.697
There's another one!

56:45.382 --> 56:48.510
Do you think one of those
could crush a coconut?

56:48.585 --> 56:50.250
Are you kidding?

56:50.251 --> 56:52.885
One of those could
crush a Volkswagen!

57:01.031 --> 57:03.522
I think
we woke up Dad.

57:05.802 --> 57:08.828
Do you suppose he'll
put the kids on time-out?

57:09.806 --> 57:10.000
Not likely. It was nice
knowing you, Elliot!

57:10.000 --> 57:12.969
You're Watching 123Movies.to
Not likely. It was nice
knowing you, Elliot!

57:12.969 --> 57:13.043
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:13.043 --> 57:15.773
You too, George.
Thanks for the adventure.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:15.773 --> 57:15.846
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:15.846 --> 57:17.541
Don't mention it.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:17.541 --> 57:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:30.660 --> 57:32.025
Sedgewick!

57:33.964 --> 57:36.455
Hey! I've been
looking for you.

57:36.533 --> 57:39.798
I followed the clues.
They worked out pretty well.

57:40.804 --> 57:42.533
That was a swim.

57:47.344 --> 57:49.005
Company?

57:50.614 --> 57:54.141
Oh, no.
I hate these guys!

58:10.767 --> 58:13.463
Sedgewick, keep it up.
I think they like it.

58:13.537 --> 58:18.600
Oh, sure, yeah. I'll just keep
running all day. No problem.

58:18.675 --> 58:22.133
Oh, it had to be me. It's not...
I am so tired... Would you...

58:24.047 --> 58:26.038
Somebody eat them.

58:26.550 --> 58:27.915
Would you?

58:41.298 --> 58:44.893
That was a good idea, swimming
over here with those...

58:44.968 --> 58:46.401
Whatever they are.

58:48.338 --> 58:51.398
Oh, no. We got to get
through there before it closes!

58:51.474 --> 58:52.771
What? Why?

58:52.843 --> 58:55.505
Robert has the Prince
and the Princess.

58:55.579 --> 58:56.739
Hang on.

58:56.813 --> 59:00.510
Now, this is the guy who wants
to crush us like coconuts, right?

59:00.584 --> 59:01.608
Uh-huh.

59:01.685 --> 59:05.018
And you're going to go in
there and stand up to him?

59:05.088 --> 59:06.180
Yep.

59:06.256 --> 59:07.917
And you're in
on this, too?

59:07.991 --> 59:09.117
Mmm.

59:11.494 --> 59:12.620
Okay.

59:16.433 --> 59:18.799
We go to row through
before it closes.

59:18.869 --> 59:20.427
I don't think
that's possible,

59:20.503 --> 59:21.902
and that's
coming from a guy

59:21.972 --> 59:25.430
who just swam 92 nautical
miles without arms or legs.

59:25.508 --> 59:27.999
Well, you got
a better idea?

59:36.620 --> 59:39.589
Yeah. We need to get through.
Can you help?

59:42.525 --> 59:45.722
What's he gonna do, chuck us
into the side of the mountain?

59:45.795 --> 59:47.729
We'll just have to
trust him.

59:47.797 --> 59:49.662
Trust him?
He's a rock!

01:00:02.279 --> 01:00:04.839
"Trust the rock,"
he says.

01:00:04.915 --> 01:00:06.644
I don't understand.

01:00:07.884 --> 01:00:09.146
Guys?

01:00:09.219 --> 01:00:14.020
We're not going to make
it. The pass is almost closed.

01:00:14.090 --> 01:00:15.990
Guys?

01:00:16.059 --> 01:00:18.926
"Trust the rock.
Trust the rock."

01:00:20.997 --> 01:00:22.726
Guys!
- What?

01:00:31.074 --> 01:00:32.132
Row!

01:00:51.761 --> 01:00:55.026
Oh, the Clapping Pass.
I get it.

01:00:58.001 --> 01:01:01.266
Must be some kind of a
secret bay or something.

01:01:01.338 --> 01:01:03.363
So, where's
this fortress?

01:01:04.607 --> 01:01:06.074
Oh.
Found it.

01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.077
Won't they
see us coming?

01:01:12.148 --> 01:01:15.083
We're flying their flag.
We should be fine.

01:01:26.563 --> 01:01:28.554
There you go.
They got a garage!

01:01:28.631 --> 01:01:31.361
Well, that makes it easy.

01:01:31.434 --> 01:01:34.801
Too easy.
It's not guarded or anything.

01:01:34.871 --> 01:01:38.329
They don't need to guard
it. Nobody can find this place.

01:01:38.408 --> 01:01:39.466
Huh?

01:01:42.645 --> 01:01:44.704
Hey, guys?
There's bubbles.

01:02:00.697 --> 01:02:03.495
Look out!
He's going to eat us!

01:02:05.769 --> 01:02:07.259
Don't eat me!

01:02:22.185 --> 01:02:23.880
Back off, serpent,

01:02:24.621 --> 01:02:27.146
or taste my steel!

01:02:29.826 --> 01:02:31.418
What?

01:02:50.313 --> 01:02:51.644
Huh?

01:02:57.187 --> 01:02:59.519
Hi, guys.
It's a contraption.

01:02:59.589 --> 01:03:03.423
I found a big lever inside,
shut the whole thing down.

01:03:03.493 --> 01:03:05.120
Pretty cool, huh?

01:03:08.198 --> 01:03:09.290
Guys?

01:03:15.472 --> 01:03:17.463
Oh, dear.

01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:20.100
Like sand
through the hourglass,

01:03:20.176 --> 01:03:24.237
so are the last few
minutes of our lives.

01:03:30.887 --> 01:03:33.754
Okay, guys, let's
go get the Princess.

01:03:40.964 --> 01:03:43.330
I'm hoping this will lead
up to the dungeon level,

01:03:43.399 --> 01:03:46.664
and that's where we'll find
the Prince and Princess.

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:54.073
Wow!
Their dungeon has a swimming pool.

01:03:54.144 --> 01:03:57.272
Oh, no.
It's a cistern.

01:03:57.347 --> 01:03:59.713
A what?
Their supply of drinking water.

01:03:59.782 --> 01:04:02.012
So they could last for
months during a battle.

01:04:02.085 --> 01:04:03.882
The dungeon must be
on the next level up.

01:04:03.953 --> 01:04:05.978
Hey! I found
the stairs.

01:04:11.361 --> 01:04:12.658
Hmm.

01:04:15.465 --> 01:04:18.866
So, what are we going to do
when we get to the dungeon?

01:04:18.935 --> 01:04:22.302
Huh? Oh, I haven't
figured that part out yet.

01:04:22.372 --> 01:04:25.239
Oh, good.
I was thinking we had a plan.

01:04:30.446 --> 01:04:32.607
Hey, I think we're there.

01:04:34.117 --> 01:04:35.880
It's locked.

01:04:35.952 --> 01:04:38.546
Yep, this
is the dungeon, all right.

01:04:38.621 --> 01:04:40.851
And look!
There's the Princess!

01:04:41.291 --> 01:04:44.226
Princess Eloise!
Princess Eloise!

01:04:45.762 --> 01:04:47.787
What?
- It's...

01:04:47.864 --> 01:04:49.354
Who is it?
It's...

01:04:49.432 --> 01:04:50.990
Our heroes!

01:04:51.067 --> 01:04:53.262
We've come
to rescue you.

01:04:54.304 --> 01:04:56.101
Do you have the keys?

01:05:03.413 --> 01:05:05.847
If only we could
get real small.

01:05:18.428 --> 01:05:20.055
That is one neat toy.

01:05:20.129 --> 01:05:23.565
It is not a toy.
It's a labor-saving device.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.991
Come on!
Time's a-wastin'!

01:05:55.965 --> 01:05:57.296
Huh? Huh?

01:06:26.596 --> 01:06:28.723
What manner of magic
is this?

01:06:28.798 --> 01:06:30.390
It's not magic.

01:06:31.167 --> 01:06:32.862
It's RadioShack!

01:06:44.681 --> 01:06:46.876
All right, quickly!

01:06:48.518 --> 01:06:50.418
I knew you'd come back.

01:06:57.393 --> 01:06:59.224
We got to go.
Follow me.

01:07:00.396 --> 01:07:01.954
Quick! The keys!

01:07:02.031 --> 01:07:03.828
But this way is...
Now!

01:07:10.873 --> 01:07:12.534
Time's up.

01:07:12.608 --> 01:07:15.270
Hello! What's this?

01:07:15.678 --> 01:07:18.613
Someone wanted to
spoil my fun?

01:07:18.681 --> 01:07:19.875
Surely not you?

01:07:19.949 --> 01:07:22.008
Oh, no, sir.

01:07:22.919 --> 01:07:24.716
Then you three?

01:07:26.689 --> 01:07:29.590
They're heroes
sent by my father.

01:07:29.659 --> 01:07:31.718
They'll be your undoing.

01:07:33.196 --> 01:07:37.292
The King's heroes?
Then you can answer my question.

01:07:37.367 --> 01:07:39.392
When will the King return?

01:07:40.336 --> 01:07:42.167
He didn't
mention it to us.

01:07:42.238 --> 01:07:43.364
It didn't come up.

01:07:43.439 --> 01:07:46.602
Surely the King's heroes
would know of his plans!

01:07:46.676 --> 01:07:48.701
Tell me
when the King will return,

01:07:48.778 --> 01:07:51.144
or say goodbye
to the Princess.

01:07:52.382 --> 01:07:55.510
Let her go!
We're not the King's heroes.

01:07:55.585 --> 01:07:57.849
We're not heroes at all.

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.354
It was all
a misunderstanding.

01:08:01.591 --> 01:08:02.819
Explain.

01:08:03.593 --> 01:08:06.289
We're no heroes.
We're cabin boys.

01:08:06.362 --> 01:08:09.820
We work in a restaurant.
We clear dishes. We clean up.

01:08:09.899 --> 01:08:12.766
We give people refills
on their soft drinks.

01:08:12.835 --> 01:08:15.326
That's right.
The King's heroes?

01:08:15.405 --> 01:08:18.340
He's so lazy, he can't even
climb a ladder without giving up.

01:08:18.408 --> 01:08:21.844
Yeah, and he's scared of everything.

01:08:21.911 --> 01:08:24.937
Spiders, snakes,
wicker furniture.

01:08:25.014 --> 01:08:26.072
It's true.

01:08:26.149 --> 01:08:27.241
And George there,

01:08:27.316 --> 01:08:31.274
he's such a wimp, even his
own son thinks he's a loser.

01:08:32.388 --> 01:08:34.049
Isn't that right?

01:08:39.694 --> 01:08:41.127
Is it true?

01:08:45.268 --> 01:08:46.929
It's true.

01:08:47.002 --> 01:08:50.996
The ball made a mistake.
We're no heroes. We're...

01:08:53.709 --> 01:08:56.337
<i>When all hope is gone,</i>

01:08:56.412 --> 01:09:02.214
<i>help will come from above</i>
<i>in the shape of a donkey.</i>

01:09:03.118 --> 01:09:04.609
Donkeys.

01:09:04.687 --> 01:09:07.349
We're not donkeys.
We're cabin boys.

01:09:14.029 --> 01:09:15.861
But even cabin boys

01:09:17.366 --> 01:09:19.357
can do what's right!

01:09:27.977 --> 01:09:29.341
Follow me!

01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:38.048
Elliot! The ball!

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:39.381
Here.

01:09:47.997 --> 01:09:50.557
We really
need help right now.

01:09:56.939 --> 01:09:58.463
Get in!
What?

01:10:00.877 --> 01:10:02.708
Everybody, lean!

01:10:05.014 --> 01:10:07.073
No! Get them!

01:10:13.289 --> 01:10:16.452
It's more fun if you hold
your hands in the air.

01:10:24.333 --> 01:10:25.322
What was that?

01:10:25.401 --> 01:10:28.063
The drain.
We're getting out of here!

01:10:31.107 --> 01:10:32.904
I'm feeling flushed!

01:10:39.348 --> 01:10:41.475
You've got to be kidding!

01:10:42.752 --> 01:10:44.686
Quick! To the ship!

01:10:45.821 --> 01:10:47.345
Whoa!

01:10:50.393 --> 01:10:52.293
What a ride!
You did it!

01:10:52.361 --> 01:10:56.229
We're not done yet.
Row! Row like the wind!

01:11:04.707 --> 01:11:07.175
We've got company!

01:11:08.844 --> 01:11:12.177
Row! Row! Row!

01:11:12.248 --> 01:11:16.878
Can I ask where we're rowing to?
The pass is closed!

01:11:16.953 --> 01:11:19.854
It could open up at any second.
Keep rowing!

01:11:21.757 --> 01:11:24.749
A noble
but pointless effort.

01:11:24.827 --> 01:11:27.057
Gentlemen, take them out.

01:11:34.971 --> 01:11:37.269
This is not
going so well.

01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:39.740
Unless that pass opens up,
we're doomed.

01:11:39.809 --> 01:11:41.834
We can't
get much further.

01:11:44.313 --> 01:11:47.248
Is there anything
that ball can do now?

01:11:47.316 --> 01:11:49.807
We really need help.

01:11:49.885 --> 01:11:51.580
Help!

01:11:51.654 --> 01:11:53.986
Nothing.
It's not blinking.

01:11:54.056 --> 01:11:57.958
They're in range now, boys.
Finish them.

01:12:01.964 --> 01:12:03.397
Whoa!

01:12:10.006 --> 01:12:11.997
What is it?
I don't know.

01:12:18.781 --> 01:12:20.214
Father!

01:12:22.218 --> 01:12:24.209
It can't be!

01:12:24.286 --> 01:12:27.346
You know what to do, men.
Watch your aim.

01:12:27.423 --> 01:12:29.414
Quickly!
Disable the ship!

01:12:35.965 --> 01:12:38.399
Where are you going?
Back to your posts!

01:12:38.467 --> 01:12:40.332
Return fire!

01:12:40.403 --> 01:12:43.201
Against the King's men?
You are mad!

01:12:48.411 --> 01:12:50.470
Men, hold your fire.

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:54.611
On my word, Brother,
I'm not finished!

01:12:54.684 --> 01:13:00.145
I'll never be finished until
that crown is on my head!

01:13:17.239 --> 01:13:21.198
For amazing tenacity,
unwillingness to give up.

01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:29.883
For extraordinary bravery
in the face of grave danger.

01:13:33.823 --> 01:13:38.590
For leadership and cunning
in a time of great peril.

01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:56.244
You wish to speak?

01:13:56.879 --> 01:14:00.815
We're glad we could help.
Your kids are real sweet.

01:14:00.883 --> 01:14:04.046
But the ball,
it doesn't work right.

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:07.248
We're no heroes.
We're cabin boys.

01:14:07.757 --> 01:14:09.918
There were no mistakes.

01:14:09.992 --> 01:14:14.088
The Helpseeker picked
exactly whom I intended.

01:14:14.163 --> 01:14:19.567
And I made sure you had everything
you needed to complete the task.

01:14:19.935 --> 01:14:23.166
The crab that
showed you the way,

01:14:23.239 --> 01:14:26.174
the lever that
saved your friends.

01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:29.041
The donkey from above.

01:14:30.112 --> 01:14:34.276
The adventure I call you to
may not be easy,

01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:37.217
but you'll never
journey alone.

01:14:37.286 --> 01:14:39.914
My help is always there.

01:14:41.056 --> 01:14:44.457
When we were on the island, the
ball said it was time to go home.

01:14:44.527 --> 01:14:49.624
That was a test, which you
passed with flying colors.

01:14:50.432 --> 01:14:55.301
Sometimes, a test helps us
decide what matters most.

01:14:55.838 --> 01:14:59.672
The hero isn't the
strongest or the fastest

01:14:59.742 --> 01:15:02.438
or the smartest
or the best-looking.

01:15:03.078 --> 01:15:08.209
The hero is the one who,
no matter how hard,

01:15:08.284 --> 01:15:11.117
does what he knows
is right.

01:15:12.121 --> 01:15:13.679
Monteria!

01:15:13.756 --> 01:15:16.782
I give you three heroes!

01:15:32.641 --> 01:15:34.939
Are you sure
you don't want to stay?

01:15:35.010 --> 01:15:38.070
We can always use
a few more heroes.

01:15:38.147 --> 01:15:40.581
No. I want to
see my kids.

01:15:40.649 --> 01:15:41.638
And my Ellen!

01:15:41.717 --> 01:15:42.979
And Bernadette!

01:15:43.052 --> 01:15:45.145
Fare thee well, friends.

01:15:45.221 --> 01:15:47.849
Your work here
is done.

01:15:50.626 --> 01:15:52.389
Sure enough.

01:15:55.264 --> 01:15:56.595
Hang on.

01:16:00.936 --> 01:16:04.235
You know, I liked them
from the very beginning.

01:16:10.946 --> 01:16:14.040
We're back. The show's
on! It must be Friday.

01:16:14.583 --> 01:16:16.107
I got to
find my kids.

01:16:16.185 --> 01:16:17.743
And the girls!

01:16:29.798 --> 01:16:32.892
<i>Our shirts are loose</i>
<i>Our pants are tight</i>

01:16:32.968 --> 01:16:34.799
<i>It's Spanish gold</i>
<i>for all tonight</i>

01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:36.303
<i>It's Spanish gold</i>
<i>for all tonight</i>

01:16:36.372 --> 01:16:38.340
Caroline! Kids!

01:16:40.376 --> 01:16:41.934
There they are!

01:16:45.447 --> 01:16:48.143
It's a fine night
for a pirate fight.

01:16:49.585 --> 01:16:51.746
<i>It's Spanish gold</i>
<i>for all tonight</i>

01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:53.913
<i>So bring</i>
<i>a hearty appetite</i>

01:16:53.989 --> 01:16:57.015
<i>Our aim is true</i>
<i>Our cause is right</i>

01:16:57.092 --> 01:16:59.253
<i>It's Spanish gold</i>
<i>for all tonight</i>

01:16:59.328 --> 01:17:02.058
Oh, no! He thinks
Sir Frederick is me!

01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:09.801
<i>It's Spanish gold</i>
<i>for all tonight</i>

01:17:09.872 --> 01:17:12.033
<i>As Spaniards quake</i>
<i>to see the sight</i>

01:17:12.107 --> 01:17:15.008
<i>Our flag unfurled</i>
<i>with black and white</i>

01:17:15.077 --> 01:17:16.942
<i>It's Spanish...</i>

01:17:17.012 --> 01:17:18.343
Hey!

01:17:21.517 --> 01:17:25.248
There's no King to
save you now, cabin boy!

01:17:25.321 --> 01:17:27.050
Elliot! The ball!

01:17:27.122 --> 01:17:28.248
It's blinking!

01:17:30.326 --> 01:17:31.691
Here it is.

01:17:44.974 --> 01:17:46.305
Stall him!

01:17:47.443 --> 01:17:49.377
Andy! Trigger B!

01:17:57.653 --> 01:18:01.214
Say hello to my little friend.
Take that!

01:18:02.424 --> 01:18:03.652
Whoa!

01:18:04.259 --> 01:18:05.487
No!

01:18:06.328 --> 01:18:08.057
Enough tricks!

01:18:11.433 --> 01:18:12.923
A little help?

01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:19.230
Ouch.

01:18:20.542 --> 01:18:22.271
Time to go home.

01:18:22.344 --> 01:18:23.936
Uh-oh.

01:18:31.787 --> 01:18:33.812
All right!

01:18:33.889 --> 01:18:35.652
That's my dad!

01:18:35.724 --> 01:18:37.954
Can I come over
to your house?

01:18:50.472 --> 01:18:52.736
I'd like to rethink
your auditions.

01:18:52.808 --> 01:18:55.777
You could really add
something to the show.

01:19:03.052 --> 01:19:06.249
I don't think we need
to be in the show after all.

01:19:07.456 --> 01:19:10.254
Life has plenty of
adventure of its own.

01:19:29.711 --> 01:19:33.545
<i>Argh, argh, argh, argh</i>

01:19:33.615 --> 01:19:37.449
<i>We are The Pirates</i>
<i>Who Don't Do Anything</i>

01:19:37.519 --> 01:19:40.215
<i>We just stay at home</i>
<i>and lie around</i>

01:19:40.289 --> 01:19:43.383
<i>And if you ask us</i>
<i>to do anything</i>

01:19:43.459 --> 01:19:46.485
<i>We'll just tell you</i>
<i>We don't do anything</i>

01:19:46.562 --> 01:19:48.245
<i>But I've never been</i>
<i>to Greenland</i>

01:19:48.246 --> 01:19:49.463
<i>And I've never been to Denver</i>

01:19:49.531 --> 01:19:52.523
<i>And I've never buried treasure</i>
<i>in St. Louis or St. Paul</i>

01:19:52.601 --> 01:19:54.159
<i>And I've never been to Moscow</i>

01:19:54.236 --> 01:19:55.760
<i>And I've never been to Tampa</i>

01:19:55.838 --> 01:19:58.534
<i>And I've never been</i>
<i>to Boston in the fall</i>

01:19:58.607 --> 01:20:01.337
<i>Hold on.</i>
<i>We're not quite done.</i>

01:20:06.281 --> 01:20:07.509
<i>Skeedoodlee bop</i>
