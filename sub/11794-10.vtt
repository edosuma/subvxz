00:03.969 --> 00:06.673
 <i>* When I wake up in the</i>

00:06.705 --> 00:09.576

00:09.609 --> 00:12.512

<i>* It's all right</i>

01:17.344 --> 01:20.714
 I like school. It's a good way
 to kill time between weekends.

01:20.747 --> 01:24.484
  It gives me five days
  to plan my Saturday night.

01:24.517 --> 01:26.619
   I did it!
   I was KBLA's 25th caller.

01:26.653 --> 01:28.488
   I won two tickets
   to go see George Michael.

01:28.521 --> 01:30.490
  Kelly, that's great.
  Who are you going to take?

01:30.523 --> 01:33.493
 Allow me to recommend
 Zack Morris.

01:33.526 --> 01:36.363
He's cute,
warm and affectionate.

01:36.396 --> 01:38.798
  And so's a cocker spaniel.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.535
 If you want a date, Kelly,
 take me.

01:42.569 --> 01:45.638
 Well, I'd love to take
 both of you, but l need
  some time to decide.

01:45.672 --> 01:47.741
  - Sounds fair.
  - Time's up.
  What's your answer?

01:47.774 --> 01:49.709
  - Zack.
  - See? She's going with me.

01:49.743 --> 01:50.977
   Too bad, Slater.

01:51.011 --> 01:53.413
( bell rings )

01:53.446 --> 01:56.516
I'll let you guys know.

01:56.549 --> 02:00.053
 Screech, in honor of your
 37th consecutive A+,

02:00.053 --> 02:02.622
you get to wear
the Mertz Molecule Hat.

02:02.655 --> 02:04.758
   ( sings )

02:06.626 --> 02:08.695
 ( applause )

02:10.630 --> 02:12.332
 It's a good way to get girls.

02:12.365 --> 02:13.600
  Thanks, Dr. Mertz.

02:13.633 --> 02:16.469
  Don't let it go to your head.
  "Bzz-bbb!"

02:18.071 --> 02:21.074
- I won't, sir.
- Good.

02:21.074 --> 02:23.343
  And now l have
  the pleasure of passing out

02:23.376 --> 02:25.712
   last week's test results.

02:25.745 --> 02:27.914
 Slater, here you go.

02:27.947 --> 02:29.482
Right.

02:30.417 --> 02:32.752
  Hey, a B-!

02:32.786 --> 02:34.487
That's decent.

02:34.521 --> 02:37.524
 Decent? If NASA scientists
 got B-s,

02:37.557 --> 02:40.493
 the space shuttle
 wouldn't get past Cleveland.

02:42.529 --> 02:46.099
 Sorry, Zack. Copy from someone
 smarter next week.

02:46.099 --> 02:49.469
 That's up to you, sir.
 You assign the seats.

02:51.104 --> 02:53.106
Kelly?

02:53.106 --> 02:55.108
Ooh, I'm really sorry.

02:55.742 --> 02:57.377
 An F?

02:57.410 --> 02:59.412
 Did l really
 deserve an F?

02:59.446 --> 03:02.916
 No, but they don't
 allow us to give Ms.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.755
   My parents are
   going to kill me.

03:08.788 --> 03:11.691
 Remember, there's one
 more test on Friday,

03:11.725 --> 03:13.893
  and that counts
  for half your final grades.

03:14.761 --> 03:16.596
  I'll be grounded for life.

03:16.629 --> 03:19.432
  No more cheerleading,
  no more volleyball.

03:19.466 --> 03:22.535
  And for sure,
  no George Michael concert.

03:22.569 --> 03:24.738
  There goes
  my weekend.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.342
 Screech, l need
 to borrow your brain.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.611
  No way, Zack.
  You still haven't returned

03:31.644 --> 03:34.848
 my tricycle from
 kindergarten.

03:34.881 --> 03:38.718
  No, l mean l need you to help
  Kelly get an A on
  her science test,

03:38.752 --> 03:41.087
 so she'll take me
 to the George Michael concert.

03:41.087 --> 03:42.722
 I don't have any time, Zack.

03:42.756 --> 03:45.091
It's mating season
on my ant farm.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.696
   I'm going to be an uncle.

03:52.098 --> 03:55.468
 Now look, Kelly is
 Lisa's friend, right?

03:55.502 --> 03:58.938
And by helping Kelly,
you'll be helping Lisa.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.574
   Ah, Lisa!

04:01.608 --> 04:04.044
 I'll never pass Mertz's class.
 I'm doomed.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.046
   Kelly, you have
   to change your attitude.

04:06.079 --> 04:09.582
 She's right, this is not
 like you. Will you start
thinking positive?

04:09.616 --> 04:12.585
  Okay, I'm positive
  I'm doomed.

04:12.619 --> 04:14.721
 Kelly, your troubles are over.

04:14.754 --> 04:18.725
 Screech here has
 agreed to share his
 wisdom and tutor you.

04:18.757 --> 04:21.060
 I will be your Yoda.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.065
   And l will be
   your everything.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.700
  And l will be gone.

04:28.401 --> 04:31.071
  I could really use your help.
  I don't know what to say.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.540
Well, just say,
"After l pass the test,

04:33.573 --> 04:36.076
   I'm going to take Zack
   to the George
   Michael concert."

04:36.076 --> 04:39.446
  Oh, Zack.
  Okay, so when do we start?

04:39.479 --> 04:41.815
  Tonight, but it has
  to be at my place.

04:41.848 --> 04:44.517
 I'm not allowed out
 after "ALF."

04:55.562 --> 04:57.931
Screech? Hello?

05:15.582 --> 05:18.084
  Gosh. You're electrifying.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.153
 Who are you?

05:20.186 --> 05:22.856
   Hi. I'm Kevin,
   Screech's robot.

05:22.889 --> 05:24.791
 Welcome to our world.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.928
Oh, hi, Kelly.

05:28.962 --> 05:32.198
   Sorry I'm late.
   I was developing
   pictures in my dark room.

05:32.232 --> 05:35.101
They're for
"Robot Illustrated."
I'm hunk of the month.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.506
 I see you've
 met my robot, Kevin.

05:39.539 --> 05:41.207
 Screech, he's just like you.

05:41.241 --> 05:42.842
 It's 'cause I programmed him.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.711
That's what he thinks.

05:44.744 --> 05:48.114
   How fun. Well, Screech,
   you've got a great room.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.684
   I mean, I've never seen
   anything like it before.

05:50.717 --> 05:53.953
 I guess you've only
 lived on one planet.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.723
   - Now let's get started.
   - I brought all my books.

05:56.756 --> 05:58.158
  Where do you want to begin?

05:58.191 --> 06:00.160
Let's start with
atomic energy.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.429
What do you know
about nuclear fission?

06:02.462 --> 06:05.031
Not much.
I always end up
losing my bait.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.869
   Better put on a pot
   of cocoa, Kevin.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.672
 It's going to be a long night.

06:14.808 --> 06:18.945
   Think of these
   dolls as cheerleader
   atoms at a football game.

06:19.045 --> 06:22.048
Alone, they are just
separate little voices.

06:22.082 --> 06:26.052
 Rah, rah,
 sis-boom-ba!

06:26.086 --> 06:28.688
 But fused together
 as a pyramid,

06:28.722 --> 06:30.156
   they are a force.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.725
 ( cheering )

06:33.226 --> 06:36.529
Oh, so if fusion is forming
a cheerleading pyramid,

06:36.563 --> 06:37.864
then fission must be...

06:37.897 --> 06:40.900
When the atoms
do the splits.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.636
 ( mimics explosion )

06:45.305 --> 06:46.706
   Thank you, Kevin.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.876
  I get it now.
  Screech, this is fantastic.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.178
 I can't believe you went
 to all this
 trouble just for me.

06:52.212 --> 06:54.514
   I wanted to show
   you that science is fun.

06:55.815 --> 06:59.252
 Beep. It's 9:00 p.m.,
 have you flossed yet?

07:00.754 --> 07:03.823
 Sorry, Kelly. We have to stop.
 It's my bedtime.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.625
   I really should
   be getting home.

07:05.658 --> 07:08.261
  Screech,
  thanks for everything.
  I really had a great time.

07:08.294 --> 07:10.697
  I did too. Well...

07:10.730 --> 07:13.633
 - Well...
 - Good night.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.036
  Good night.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.078
  She's cute.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.786
  Well, she's got
  all the symptoms...

07:32.819 --> 07:35.088
  glassy eyes,
  goofy look.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.691
  Mismatched wardrobe.
  It can only mean one thing.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.093
 Both: Crush!

07:41.628 --> 07:43.096
  Come on, Kelly.
  Who are you thinking about?

07:43.129 --> 07:45.632
   - Is he cute?
   - Well, kind of.

07:45.665 --> 07:48.802
  He's real intelligent,
  got a great sense of humor,

07:48.835 --> 07:50.970
and he's really
fun to be with.

07:51.071 --> 07:53.873
  If I found someone like that,
  I'd never let him go.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.575
  So give already.
  Who is it?

07:55.608 --> 07:57.110
   Screech.

08:01.881 --> 08:03.249
 Kelly, you're kidding right?

08:03.283 --> 08:06.586
 No, l had so much fun studying
 with Screech in
 his room last night.

08:06.619 --> 08:09.022
 You were in his room?

08:09.022 --> 08:12.625
  Didn't the bats bother you?

08:12.659 --> 08:15.328
 That is just a rumor.
 None of his creatures can fly.

08:15.362 --> 08:17.797
   You know,
   Lisa, you really ought
   to give Screech a chance.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.633
 I'd rather give
 chickenpox a chance.

08:20.667 --> 08:24.170
   Hey, I'm telling you,
   Screech can be
   really charming.

08:24.204 --> 08:26.706
He definitely did
something to her brain.

08:26.740 --> 08:29.876
 He did. I'm seeing Screech
 in a completely different way.

08:29.909 --> 08:32.312
 The best way is blindfolded.

08:34.681 --> 08:38.051
 Screech, you still haven't
 told me how it went with
 Kelly last night.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.318
   We've been
   over it already.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.188
 Okay, so how many times
 did my name come up?

08:42.222 --> 08:45.792
None, zero, zilch.
Zippity-doo-da.

08:45.825 --> 08:47.227
 All right, all right,

08:47.260 --> 08:50.263
   but l bet she was thinking
   about me the whole time.

08:50.296 --> 08:52.298
 Screech, all l can think about
 since last night

08:52.332 --> 08:53.667
  is the stuff we went over.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.268
 - Hi, Kelly.
 - I got my book here.

08:55.301 --> 08:56.803
   Maybe we can
   review right now?

08:56.836 --> 08:58.371
 - Sure.
 - Hi, Kelly.

08:58.405 --> 09:01.775
Let's go to our own table.
It'll be a lot quieter.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.109
  Bye, Kelly.

09:08.815 --> 09:10.216
  Don't take it personally,
  Zack,

09:10.250 --> 09:12.252
   but Kelly's only got
   eyes for Screech.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.721
   What?
   Get out of town.

09:14.754 --> 09:15.855
   Here's your usual, Kelly.

09:15.889 --> 09:19.025
Thanks.
Screech, would you like
to split this with me?

09:19.025 --> 09:20.727
 - Sure.
 - No problem.

09:20.760 --> 09:24.898
 Service for one is
 now service for two.

09:24.931 --> 09:26.299
  Thank you.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.368
  Come on,
  you guys are crazy.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.037
  There's nothing going on
  between Screech and Kelly.

09:31.037 --> 09:34.641
 It's just a simple tutor-tutee
 relationship.

09:34.674 --> 09:37.277
   You should see
   what he's doing
   with your tutee.

09:44.217 --> 09:47.387
I think we've just entered
"The Twilight Zone."

09:51.891 --> 09:53.960
   Slater, I'm telling you,

09:54.060 --> 09:58.565
 they were drinking
 from the same malt.
 Their lips were this close.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.935
 Kelly and Screech?
 Forget it, Preppie. No sale.

10:01.968 --> 10:03.970
 I saw it with my
 own two eyes.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.272
Screech was
being charming.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.641
 He was using a spoon.

10:10.043 --> 10:13.713
   - Get outta town.
   - Oh, you get outta town.

10:16.383 --> 10:19.686
   Okay,
   let's put it to the test.

10:19.719 --> 10:22.622
  Hey Kelly, how about
  a pizza and movie tonight?

10:22.655 --> 10:25.125
 Sorry, Slater, l already have
 dinner plans with "Screechie."

10:25.158 --> 10:28.395
 After that, "Kel-Kel"
 and I are going to be
 studying at my place.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.330
   Yeah, probably till late.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.202
  Screechie?

10:36.970 --> 10:38.672
   Kel-Kel?

10:39.439 --> 10:42.142
  Okay, define radioactivity.

10:42.175 --> 10:45.345
   Changing stations till you
   find your favorite song?

10:45.378 --> 10:48.214
( Kevin buzzes )
Wrong.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.884
   I was just joking, Kevin.

10:50.917 --> 10:54.254
 Radioactivity is
 the spontaneous
 emission of waves or particles

10:54.287 --> 10:56.222
 from decaying atomic nuclei.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.757
  Very good.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.693
  Excellent, Kel-Kel.

11:01.061 --> 11:04.097
Okay, now that we know
what radioactivity is,

11:04.130 --> 11:06.066
 how about radiation?

11:06.099 --> 11:08.134
 ( knocking on door )

11:08.168 --> 11:11.104
Kevin, you didn't order
a pizza again, did you?

11:11.137 --> 11:12.806
   Don't look at me.

11:19.145 --> 11:23.216
   - Hey, Screech.
   - Zack,
   what are you doing here?

11:23.249 --> 11:27.420
  Me? I came by to return
  Screech's tricycle.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.223
Screech, is that yours?

11:30.256 --> 11:32.325
It was in kindergarten.

11:34.094 --> 11:37.197
 Kelly, what
 a pleasant surprise.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.466
Preppie, what are
you doing here?

11:39.499 --> 11:42.302
  I was just about
  to ask you the same thing.

11:42.335 --> 11:45.171
   I got stuck on a little
   science problem at home.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.940
  - What is it?
  - Screech,

11:46.973 --> 11:50.844
 can you explain Einstein's
 Theory of Relativity?

11:50.877 --> 11:53.813
   It's pretty complicated.
   It could take all night.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.749
  - I can wait.
  - You guys,

11:55.782 --> 11:58.118
 we're in the middle
 of something here.
Do you mind?

11:58.118 --> 11:59.819
  Both: Yes.

12:02.055 --> 12:05.191
 Sorry. Why don't we meet
 tomorrow after school

12:05.225 --> 12:07.394
 and do guy things?
 Bye.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.763
 Both: But...

12:09.796 --> 12:12.866
Screech, that was great.
You really took charge.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.901
  Science brings out
  the animal in him.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.171
  Now, where were we?

12:20.140 --> 12:22.842
 Now, this blender is an atom,

12:22.876 --> 12:25.211
  and the popcorn
  are its particles.

12:25.245 --> 12:29.249
 If we were to bombard
 the atom, the particles
 would split apart.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.117
 I'm not so sure
 l understand.

12:31.151 --> 12:34.421
  Watch. My finger
  will bombard
  this blender and...

12:39.426 --> 12:41.795
we have radioactivity.

12:41.828 --> 12:43.763
 Screech,
 you're the greatest.

12:43.797 --> 12:45.098
Thanks.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.000
 I understand.
 I see it now.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.803
You're the best teacher
I've ever had.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.111
   Preppie,

12:58.111 --> 13:01.247
  we just lost our girl
  to a nerd.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.818
Let's keep this a secret.
We've got
reputations to protect.

13:04.851 --> 13:06.252
 Shh.

13:10.056 --> 13:11.524
  Kelly and Screech together!

13:11.558 --> 13:13.460
 This is hot!

13:14.828 --> 13:16.763
  Kelly and Screech!

13:17.364 --> 13:19.232
  Kelly and Screech!

13:19.265 --> 13:21.167
 Kelly
 and Screech!

13:21.201 --> 13:22.369
  Kelly and Screech!

13:22.402 --> 13:24.437
 Kelly
 and Screech!

13:24.471 --> 13:26.272
  Kelly and Screech?

13:38.184 --> 13:40.086
  ( beeping )

13:46.092 --> 13:48.561
   Something tells me
   the secret's out.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.269
 I remember the first time
 Screech proposed to me
 in kindergarten.

13:56.302 --> 13:58.872
I buried his head
in the sandbox.

13:58.905 --> 14:00.273
We got out
early that day.

14:00.306 --> 14:03.476
 Mrs. Gurskey had to call
 the fire department.

14:03.510 --> 14:07.414
 Kelly has no right to steal
 the one guy l love to reject.

14:09.416 --> 14:13.053
 - It's him!
 - Screech can we sit with you?

14:13.086 --> 14:16.456
 Well, l guess so,
 if we can find a table for 18.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.230
   Screech-mania...

14:24.264 --> 14:27.300
   is all over Bayside
   like a bad rash.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.802
   You know, l don't get it.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.870
 - What do they see in him?
 - Slater: You got me.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.939
   Kelly's the most popular
   girl in school.

14:32.972 --> 14:35.375
 If she wore
 a pizza on her head
 and called it a hat,

14:35.408 --> 14:38.278
 there'd be a run
 on pepperoni.

14:38.311 --> 14:41.081
Screech is
the fashion statement?

14:41.114 --> 14:42.816
Scary thought.

14:45.952 --> 14:47.520
   Got a date
   for the prom yet?

14:47.554 --> 14:50.123
  Well, I've been asked by
  the captains of
  the football team,

14:50.156 --> 14:53.126
  the basketball team,
  the debating
  team, and the class hunk...

14:53.159 --> 14:55.462
nothing to get
excited about.

14:55.495 --> 14:59.099
 Yeah, l know what you mean.
 All the good nerds are taken.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.502
Hello.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.306
Hello!

15:08.208 --> 15:11.544
 - Hey, me first.
 - Hey, out of my way.

15:11.578 --> 15:14.080
  Did your mother ever
  teach you manners?

15:14.114 --> 15:15.815
   Hey, come on,
   come on.

15:15.849 --> 15:17.917
  ( silly laughter )

15:22.922 --> 15:25.358
 Way to go, spazzola.

15:25.392 --> 15:27.460
  Walk much as a kid?

15:28.361 --> 15:29.562
Oh! Oh.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.265
   Both: Hi, girls!

15:34.434 --> 15:36.169
  Oh, girls.

15:36.202 --> 15:39.172
   The Bayside stud-muffins
   are here.

15:39.205 --> 15:41.207
That's us.
Yep, yep, yep.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.343
   Hey, do you know
   anybody who can do this?

15:46.146 --> 15:49.349
Wow, that is so cool.
Can you teach us
how to do that?

15:50.917 --> 15:54.621
 Maybe later.
 Kelly's here.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.090
- Darn.
- Hello, boys.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.292
  Kelly, come here.
  Come here.

15:59.325 --> 16:01.361
 Kelly, you want
 to come over tonight

16:01.394 --> 16:04.497
   and look at my
   lint collection?

16:04.531 --> 16:09.569
 No she can't.
 She's coming over to look
 at my ear-wax sculptures.

16:09.602 --> 16:12.939
Sorry,
boys, I'm not seeing either
one of you anymore.

16:13.039 --> 16:14.874
Nerds are out.

16:14.908 --> 16:17.877
  - Well, what's in?
  - ( dramatic music plays )

16:27.954 --> 16:31.091
 The name is Bond...
 Screech Bond.

16:35.362 --> 16:37.530
   I have a license to love.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.602
   - Wow.
   - Tough.

16:44.137 --> 16:46.573
   There's only one way
   to outfox a nerd.

16:46.606 --> 16:48.541
You get a bigger nerd.

16:54.647 --> 16:57.217
  Are you sure this one
  is going to work, Preppie?

16:57.250 --> 16:58.651
   Trust me, Slater,

16:58.685 --> 17:01.688
 if Belding thinks
 Kelly and Screech
 are getting married,

17:01.721 --> 17:03.223
 he'll break them up.

17:03.256 --> 17:06.059
 Let's hope he doesn't
 buy them Tupperware.

17:06.092 --> 17:08.494
 The aluminum drive was
 over last week, boys.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.563
   You're a little late
   with those cans.

17:12.598 --> 17:15.702
  Cans, sir?
  What cans?

17:17.037 --> 17:18.570
   Move it.

17:21.273 --> 17:22.709
 Moving, sir.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.651
 ( nervous laughter )

17:31.685 --> 17:34.054
That was supposed
to be a secret.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.589
  - What is?
  - Um, nothing sir.

17:36.623 --> 17:39.125
 Yeah,
 this certainly has nothing
 to do with Screech and Kelly.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.061
   - Shh!
   - Boys...

17:41.094 --> 17:44.164
  need l remind
  you that anything
  that goes on in my school,

17:44.197 --> 17:47.067
concerning my students
is principal territory?

17:48.201 --> 17:50.103
   He does have
   a right to know.

17:50.136 --> 17:52.405
  But it's not
  our place to tell.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.674
 Well, what does all
 this stuff have to do

17:54.708 --> 17:56.743
   with Screech
   and Kelly anyway?

17:56.776 --> 17:58.611
 It's not like they're
 getting married or anything.

17:58.645 --> 18:01.147
  ( laughs )

18:01.181 --> 18:03.116
 You didn't hear it
 from us, sir.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.353
Excuse us, Mr. Belding,

18:06.386 --> 18:08.021
 but we've got to tie those
 to the back

18:08.021 --> 18:10.490
  of the honeymoon 10-speed.

18:10.523 --> 18:13.093
   Look, l understand
   how kids your age

18:13.126 --> 18:16.529
  might misread
  a close friendship
  as something more.

18:16.563 --> 18:18.565
   You see the road
   I'm following here, son?

18:18.598 --> 18:22.469
 No, l think you lost me
 at the on-ramp, sir.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.271
I'm talking about
you and Kelly.

18:25.305 --> 18:28.041
   I don't think either of you
   realizes what lies ahead.

18:28.041 --> 18:31.144
 Well, sure we do.
 Friday's the big day.

18:31.177 --> 18:35.515
 Friday?
 Do you really think you're
 ready for something like this?

18:35.548 --> 18:38.651
  I'm always ready.
  I just hope she is.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.587
 Do your parents know?

18:40.620 --> 18:43.390
  Of course they do.
  She's been at my
  house every night.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.692
And they have
no objections?

18:45.725 --> 18:48.461
  No, they're rooting us on.

18:48.495 --> 18:51.698
   Well, l have objections.
   Screech, you can't elope.

18:51.731 --> 18:54.768
Who are you
calling a cantaloupe,
you melon head?

19:02.375 --> 19:04.277
I'm sorry, Mr. Belding.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.513
Screech,
get a hold of yourself.

19:06.546 --> 19:10.583
Teenage marriage
is a very serious step.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.452
What teenage marriage?

19:12.485 --> 19:14.354
  Yours and Kelly's.

19:14.387 --> 19:17.057
   I'm not getting married.
   Is she?

19:17.090 --> 19:20.060
   Well then,
   what's all this about
   Friday being the big day?

19:20.093 --> 19:22.128
   Well, it is.
   In science class.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.364
  It's the final test we've
  been cramming for all week.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.666
( thud, door creaking )

19:26.700 --> 19:31.137
 Oh, so all this talk about you
 and Kelly getting married

19:31.171 --> 19:34.808
   is just some crazy hoax
   perpetrated by...

19:37.110 --> 19:39.612
 ...a couple
 of detention lifers.

19:41.214 --> 19:43.283
( bell rings )

19:43.316 --> 19:45.618
So ends another
science soiree.

19:45.652 --> 19:48.555
Pick up your tests
on the way out, please.

19:56.262 --> 19:59.532
All right, B+, Preppie.

19:59.566 --> 20:00.734
 How'd you do?

20:00.767 --> 20:02.435
- I got a C.
- Yeah?

20:02.469 --> 20:05.405
Yeah, it says,
"See me after school."

20:08.842 --> 20:10.510
I got an A, I got an A!

20:10.543 --> 20:12.679
  That means I'm going
  to pass the course!

20:12.712 --> 20:14.447
  Screech, we did it!

20:14.481 --> 20:16.483
No you did it, Kelly.
I only helped.

20:16.516 --> 20:19.185
  That means l get to go to
  the George Michael concert.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.454
- And guess who I'm taking?
- Zack?

20:21.488 --> 20:23.423
   - No.
   - Slater?

20:23.456 --> 20:24.491
   No, I'll give you a hint.

20:24.524 --> 20:27.494
 Someone l know who's
 the smartest guy in science.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.429
  Dr. Mertz?

20:29.863 --> 20:31.965
No, silly, you!

20:31.998 --> 20:35.835
  Me? Why would you want
  to take me to
  see George Michael?

20:35.869 --> 20:37.270
  I hate him.

20:37.771 --> 20:39.439
You do?

20:39.472 --> 20:41.207
   Oh. Well, then where would
   you like to go celebrate?

20:41.241 --> 20:43.643
 How about
 the International Insect Expo?

20:43.677 --> 20:47.347
 I hear this year they're
 having a petting zoo.

20:47.380 --> 20:51.317
 I don't think so.
 Why don't we go
 play volleyball on the beach?

20:51.351 --> 20:55.255
No, I've had a fear of sand
ever since l was
in kindergarten.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.760
I guess we don't have
a lot in common, do we?

21:00.794 --> 21:02.662
  Guess not.

21:02.696 --> 21:04.264
  You're beach and sunscreen,

21:04.297 --> 21:06.399
  I'm ant farms
  and allergy pills.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.870
   Every ice cream cone
   has its last lick, Kelly,

21:10.904 --> 21:12.539
 and this one's ours.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.674
  I'll never forget
  how you helped me.

21:19.913 --> 21:22.248
  We'll always have science.

21:25.819 --> 21:27.253
   Rebound.

21:29.289 --> 21:30.357
  So, Kelly,

21:30.390 --> 21:32.892
looks like you need
a date for
the concert after all.

21:32.926 --> 21:35.095
 - Pick you up around 7:00?
 - Forget it, Preppie.

21:35.095 --> 21:37.797
  She's taking me,
  aren't you, Kelly?

21:37.831 --> 21:40.433
Why don't you guys go?

21:40.467 --> 21:42.569
 I really don't feel up to it.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.575
 Whoa.
 You think she'll be all right?

21:48.608 --> 21:51.811
 Oh yeah.
 How long could it take
 to get over Screech?

21:51.845 --> 21:53.847
 You're right.

21:53.880 --> 21:56.850
   Well, looks like we're going
   to the concert together.

21:56.883 --> 21:59.953
   I'm not going on
   a date with you.

22:00.053 --> 22:03.723
 - Well,
 then give me your ticket.
 - No, give me yours.

22:05.759 --> 22:08.528
   Well, these are
   front row seats.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.499
 Pick you up at 7:00?

22:12.532 --> 22:14.801
 If you get me home by 10:00.

22:22.075 --> 22:24.811
  ( instrumental
  theme music plays )
