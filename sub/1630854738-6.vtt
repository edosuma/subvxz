WEBVTT

00:11.052 --> 00:12.220
Cookie.

00:13.555 --> 00:16.349
Could we please stop the <i>90210</i> marathon?

00:16.433 --> 00:18.935
I had a dirty dream
about Andrea Zuckerman.

00:19.436 --> 00:20.895
I'm so confused.

00:21.479 --> 00:24.607
This show is the only thing
getting me through my breakup with Jay.

00:25.108 --> 00:26.776
Oh, I know you're hurting.

00:26.860 --> 00:30.238
But, again, you actually have to date
someone to break up with them.

00:31.614 --> 00:33.658
I like it better under here.

00:33.742 --> 00:37.579
Oh my God. Still with the <i>90210?</i>
This is getting pathetic.

00:37.662 --> 00:40.915
I'm not gonna say it to her face,
but she needs professional help.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.710
I saw her yesterday wandering
just through the neighborhood

00:43.793 --> 00:45.420
like our grandpa used to.

00:45.920 --> 00:46.838
Near the end.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.924
Guys, stop.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.634
She's going through something.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.887
Something really stupid.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.264
Gwen! I'm right here!

00:56.765 --> 00:58.224
Good. You needed to hear it.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.519
How long am I going to feel this bad?

01:01.603 --> 01:04.856
It takes about half the time
you were in a relationship to get over it.

01:04.939 --> 01:07.609
And since you were never
<i>in</i> a relationship…

01:08.818 --> 01:09.819
You're good.

01:11.029 --> 01:13.990
Leia, come on.
Don't go back into your sad hole.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.493
We came by to give you
your birthday present.

01:18.286 --> 01:21.539
Guys, I love it. How did you know my size?

01:22.248 --> 01:25.085
We got you an extra large
so we can enjoy it too.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.296
Is this chair too small?

01:29.672 --> 01:31.758
Just give Leia our birthday card already.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.176
Inside cat.

01:33.259 --> 01:34.928
Outside cat.

01:35.011 --> 01:37.764
Inside cat. Outside cat. Ins--

01:37.847 --> 01:38.681
No more cat.

01:39.224 --> 01:42.644
I missed you guys.
My sad hole was lonely without you.

01:43.728 --> 01:46.856
I'm not gonna let my breakup with Jay
ruin my birthday.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.108
Not a breakup.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.193
Not a breakup.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.403
Not a breakup.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.824
How many times
do you turn 15 in your life?

01:56.366 --> 01:57.367
Not that many.

01:58.827 --> 01:59.911
I'm over him.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.788
New year, new me.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.040
New Kids On The Block.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.251
I over-corrected.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.213
What's this?
You spelled my name wrong on this card.

02:10.296 --> 02:12.423
How do you not know
how to spell your girlfriend's name?

02:12.507 --> 02:13.842
Let me see that.

02:15.426 --> 02:16.427
Nik!

02:17.595 --> 02:19.764
People are leaving? I just got this right.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.683
<i>-One, two, three, four!</i>

02:33.319 --> 02:35.363
<i>Hello, Wisconsin!</i>

02:35.989 --> 02:40.076
Well, Donna and Eric aren't gonna make it
for Leia's birthday.

02:41.077 --> 02:45.456
Eric's upset, but he knew the risks
when he signed up for Space Camp.

02:45.540 --> 02:50.211
Kitty, he fell out of his bunk bed.
It's not exactly Apollo 13.

02:50.795 --> 02:53.464
Well, he is gonna wish
he slept on the bottom bunk

02:53.548 --> 02:58.303
because I am throwing
a classic Kitty Forman birthday bash.

03:01.139 --> 03:02.682
It's you and me, old friend.

03:02.765 --> 03:04.809
We're about to put on a show.

03:05.476 --> 03:08.021
You're planning a kid's party.

03:08.104 --> 03:11.608
So let's try and not
get all stressed out this time.

03:11.691 --> 03:12.734
Don't worry.

03:12.817 --> 03:15.069
I woke up early to get a head start.

03:15.153 --> 03:18.948
Oh my God, it's 7:00 a.m.
I haven't deviled a damn thing!

03:20.825 --> 03:22.410
Well, I did my part.

03:22.493 --> 03:23.995
Took care of the gift.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.164
Twenty dollars.

03:27.248 --> 03:29.500
-You did one thing. Good for you.

03:32.295 --> 03:35.173
I'm sorry. I snapped.
It's… Birthdays are fun.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.718
It's gonna be a long day.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.263
Hey there! Hi there! Ho there!

03:43.806 --> 03:45.934
And it just got longer.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.311
-Bob. You made it.

03:50.021 --> 03:50.939
You knew about this?

03:51.022 --> 03:53.066
And you didn't, and that's why he's here.

03:53.149 --> 03:54.776
-Hi!
-Hi.

03:54.859 --> 03:57.820
I brought you some fresh Florida oranges.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.989
I used them as a pillow on the plane.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.701
So, if you find any curly hairs in there,
that's me.

04:04.661 --> 04:08.581
Well, I am just gonna put these
in the dishwasher.

04:10.833 --> 04:13.002
There's the birthday girl!

04:13.086 --> 04:15.338
Happy birthday.

04:16.631 --> 04:17.966
I said it first.

04:19.008 --> 04:20.009
Hey, Grandpa Bob.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.053
Ooh! Look at you.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.431
You are so darn beautiful.

04:26.015 --> 04:29.269
Those Pinciotti genes
are strong like a bull.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.229
Bull-something.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.315
That milk's for the party!

04:36.693 --> 04:39.279
I mean, happy birthday, honey.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.365
Happy birthday, kiddo.

04:42.448 --> 04:43.950
Is Grandma all right?

04:44.867 --> 04:46.119
I'd lay low.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.334
If you don't even know
how I spell my name,

04:53.418 --> 04:55.086
what else do you not know about me?

04:55.169 --> 04:57.380
I don't know what I don't know, Nik.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.427
Ask me something about your boobs.
I can draw those on a napkin.

05:03.761 --> 05:05.471
You're buying <i>us</i> lunch on <i>your</i> birthday?

05:06.347 --> 05:09.559
I felt like I needed to thank you guys
for taking care of me this week.

05:09.642 --> 05:10.810
I wasn't too bad, was I?

05:15.857 --> 05:17.233
Oh, you weren't kidding.

05:17.734 --> 05:22.196
I'm glad you finally realized it's dumb
to let a man waste so much of your time.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.114
That's our job.

05:24.365 --> 05:26.993
You're right.
I'm going to have a great birthday.

05:27.076 --> 05:29.245
All that moping around stuff
is in the past.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.288
Good.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.999
'Cause Jay and Serena just walked in.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.668
This is bad. She's gonna have a relapse.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.673
Yeah. Leia, you don't need this right now.
Let's just get outta here.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.383
Seriously, guys, I'm fine.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.053
I'm gonna go over there
and say hi like a normal person.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.681
How's it going, turkeys?

05:49.307 --> 05:52.643
I like her body language.
Strong, assertive.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.228
She just picked up a pickle.

05:54.312 --> 05:57.440
So today's my birthday.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.109
New year, startin' fresh.
The big one-five.

06:01.277 --> 06:04.697
Aww, that's so cute!
I barely even remember turning 15.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.157
I think I was in the Bahamas.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.658
Me too!

06:07.742 --> 06:08.951
But you're here right now.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.411
No, you're here.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.122
Anywhistle, big party tonight.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.292
My grandma's inviting her bridge club,
so the roof shall be raised.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.962
Actually, I'm so rude.
You guys should come.

06:20.838 --> 06:23.132
-Are you sure?
-Of course.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.511
I want all my friends
and their new girlfriends at my party.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.930
Okay, great. We'll be there.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.933
As will I. Cannot wait.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.854
I just ruined my birthday.

06:38.022 --> 06:41.109
This is where you're supposed to tell me
I didn't just ruin my birthday.

06:41.192 --> 06:42.151
But you did.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.737
This pickle's bad luck!

06:45.238 --> 06:47.073
Don't put your demon pickle near me.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.748
You wanna lose that hand?

06:56.332 --> 07:01.462
You know, it's hard
to take the joy out of a cupcake.

07:02.046 --> 07:03.047
But you did.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.844
Well, if you don't wanna help me,
you can go sit in the living room

07:07.927 --> 07:11.180
and talk to Bob
about his prosthetic testicle.

07:12.682 --> 07:14.350
Why did you have to invite him?

07:14.434 --> 07:18.104
I don't know what you're getting
worked up about. He's Leia's grandpa too.

07:18.187 --> 07:19.522
I blame Eric.

07:21.190 --> 07:24.527
There's only one girl in the world
with Bob as her dad,

07:24.610 --> 07:26.988
and he had to pick her.

07:28.072 --> 07:30.032
Hey there, what's cookin'?

07:30.700 --> 07:32.618
-'Cause we're in the kitchen.
-Oh.

07:34.412 --> 07:35.538
Damn it.

07:35.621 --> 07:39.584
We said his name three times
and summoned him like Beetlejuice.

07:41.502 --> 07:44.630
I'm gonna make my famous clam dip
for the party.

07:44.714 --> 07:47.842
Oh, that's sweet,
but we have plenty of food for tonight.

07:47.925 --> 07:50.720
I know, but the kids are gonna want
something good.

07:52.513 --> 07:54.891
I was thawing a ham in there.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.019
I'm just excited.

07:58.102 --> 08:02.231
You know, I went all out
on Leia's birthday gift this year.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.609
I got her a karaoke machine.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.821
-Aren't those things expensive?
-Oh yeah.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.531
I left the price tag on.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.910
'Cause I want her to…

08:13.993 --> 08:15.995
…remember how much I love her.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.207
I need a minute!

08:22.084 --> 08:24.212
This guy thinks he can run my party?

08:24.295 --> 08:26.756
Clam my ham? No, sir!

08:28.049 --> 08:30.510
You can rinse off your ham, Kitty.

08:31.052 --> 08:34.639
My 20 bucks is getting its ass kicked
by a karaoke machine.

08:34.722 --> 08:37.058
Well, then, step it up, Red.

08:37.141 --> 08:39.602
You've got twice the balls, act like it.

08:43.272 --> 08:44.690
You guys, I think I figured out

08:44.774 --> 08:47.068
why I invited Jay and his girlfriend
to my party.

08:47.151 --> 08:47.985
You ready?

08:48.486 --> 08:49.612
I'm not over Jay.

08:50.655 --> 08:53.032
-Oh my God. No way.
-What?

08:54.951 --> 08:56.244
I know!

08:56.327 --> 08:57.787
I'm surprised too.

08:58.496 --> 08:59.747
And it's all my fault.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.415
Because, guys…

09:01.499 --> 09:03.417
-I'm Brenda.
-Brenda?

09:03.501 --> 09:06.254
-Brenda Walsh, from <i>90210.</i>

09:06.337 --> 09:09.674
Brenda obsesses over the guy,
but she never <i>goes </i>for the guy.

10:02.143 --> 10:05.187
All my life, people told me
I was running away.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.272
But, really,

10:07.273 --> 10:08.774
I've been running <i>to</i> something.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.067
It's me, isn't it?

10:10.776 --> 10:11.611
It is.

10:19.827 --> 10:23.748
Hey, Leia. I'm DJing a party tonight.
You wanna come? It's gonna be fresh.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.791
Not now, David.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.919
It's because I'm a freshman, isn't it?

10:33.507 --> 10:36.844
So Brenda's the passive,
overly dramatic doormat.

10:36.927 --> 10:38.512
This makes sense now.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.097
I know, right?

10:40.181 --> 10:42.099
But you know who always gets the guy?

10:42.183 --> 10:45.436
Kelly, the popular blonde
with the rich-girl attitude.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.994
All my life, people told me
I was running away.

11:02.578 --> 11:03.496
But, really,

11:04.205 --> 11:05.665
I've been running <i>to</i> something.

11:05.748 --> 11:06.957
It's me, isn't it?

11:07.041 --> 11:08.042
No, bitch. It's me.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.588
-Leia?
-It's Kelly.

11:13.172 --> 11:16.550
Hey, guys. I'm DJing a party tonight.
You wanna come? It's gonna be fresh.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.010
Not now, David.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.014
It's because I'm a freshman, isn't it?

11:25.559 --> 11:28.562
I like it.
Mind if I riff on it a little bit?

11:36.779 --> 11:39.448
Hey, guys. I'm DJing a party.
It's gonna be fresh.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.576
This totally rad breakdancer's
gonna be there. Check it.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.162
Drop that beat.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.304
That's the coolest kid I've ever seen!

12:07.435 --> 12:08.686
Really, dude?

12:09.270 --> 12:10.563
David don't lie.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.734
When Jay and Serena show up at my party,
I'm gonna show 'em what's what.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.235
Kelly-style.

12:16.318 --> 12:18.821
This is why we get paid 30% less than men.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.616
What happened to not obsessing over Jay?

12:22.700 --> 12:24.201
I'm not obsessing.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.704
I'm just gonna change how I look
and how I act and how I think

12:26.787 --> 12:27.621
to win him back.

12:29.540 --> 12:32.376
-Hey! What was that for?
-To snap you out of it.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.419
Dude!

12:34.170 --> 12:35.045
Hey!

12:35.129 --> 12:36.380
Ow. Stop.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.549
I am the wrong audience for this.

12:38.632 --> 12:39.717
Ow!

12:40.259 --> 12:41.802
-I got the gift.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.429
-Where's Bob?
-Oh.

12:43.971 --> 12:44.805
Well…

12:45.556 --> 12:47.266
He was driving me crazy, so I…

12:47.767 --> 12:50.060
I put some cold medicine in his iced tea.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.731
And some in his potato salad.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.817
Some more in his pudding.

12:58.068 --> 13:01.864
He just… He wouldn't go down, Red.
It was like… drugging a rhino.

13:03.491 --> 13:06.076
Anyhoo, he's fast asleep upstairs.

13:06.160 --> 13:09.455
Wait till you see what I got Leia.

13:09.538 --> 13:14.043
Bob went expensive, but I went thoughtful.

13:14.126 --> 13:16.295
You sweet, sweet man.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.381
Her own cordless drill.

13:22.426 --> 13:25.012
You stupid, stupid man.

13:25.930 --> 13:29.141
But it's a great gift.
It gives her independence.

13:29.225 --> 13:33.145
She can fix things on her own.
Take care of herself.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.066
Why are you looking at me like that?

13:38.108 --> 13:40.110
Did I not say it was cordless?

13:42.571 --> 13:45.366
Red, you need to think like a teenager.

13:45.449 --> 13:47.660
What did you want when you were 15?

13:47.743 --> 13:49.495
A vaccine for polio.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.165
All right. I'll keep looking.

13:53.249 --> 13:56.418
Man… I must have been really tired.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.381
I fell asleep in the hallway.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.969
Well… you know,
that jet lag can be a killer.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.097
Let me get you some more iced tea.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.063
Ooh!

14:16.146 --> 14:18.566
Somebody brought their appetite.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.610
So which one of my hors d'oeuvres
do you like best?

14:22.111 --> 14:24.238
This clam dip? Love!

14:26.824 --> 14:27.825
Whoopsie.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.373
Okay, I've figured out high heels.
You can let go now.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.250
So you're gonna stand here
and wait for Jay?

14:36.333 --> 14:39.753
Yeah. And when he gets here,
I'm gonna grab him and Kelly his face off.

14:45.342 --> 14:46.760
This is so embarrassing.

14:49.138 --> 14:52.850
I thought I could win back Jay,
but he didn't even care enough to show.

14:53.809 --> 14:54.643
I get it.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.646
No one came to watch me
DJ at the Peach Pit.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.690
Not even Donna Martin.

14:59.773 --> 15:00.649
It's the worst.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.694
What was she like? I mean, between scenes?

15:04.820 --> 15:05.905
What do you mean, "scenes"?

15:07.698 --> 15:08.741
Never mind.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.411
Thank you for coming
to my birthday, David.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.872
-You were always my favorite.
-I'll take it.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.419
Who are you talking to?

15:20.502 --> 15:21.837
Uh, David. Nobody.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.381
This is stupid.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.383
I wasted my whole birthday
thinking about Jay,

15:26.467 --> 15:27.968
and he's clearly moved on.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.178
I'm done being pathetic.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.179
Finally!

15:30.262 --> 15:32.681
-Move, he's here! Move, he's here!

15:34.725 --> 15:35.684
Grandpa Bob?

15:36.185 --> 15:38.604
You mean Grandpa Tom Jones.

15:39.813 --> 15:42.816
I'm here to sing your birthday song
on your birthday gift.

15:42.900 --> 15:45.653
You're gonna sing?
In front of my friends? In that jacket?

15:45.736 --> 15:46.862
I'll be over here.

15:48.572 --> 15:49.740
Tom Jones?

15:50.240 --> 15:54.119
More like Tom groans
getting up from the couch. Am I right?

15:55.537 --> 15:56.830
I am right.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.961
Wrong song, but, hey, the show must go on.

16:02.544 --> 16:06.799
I'd like to dedicate this song
to my beautiful granddaughter, Leia.

16:06.882 --> 16:08.175
This one's for you.

16:08.258 --> 16:09.426
Oh no.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.313
Hey, it worked out. It's a birthday song.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.273
This is not a birthday song.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.900
We'll ride it out together.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.079
This is our song.

16:38.580 --> 16:41.417
It was playing on the radio the first time
you let me touch your butt.

16:42.459 --> 16:43.961
Oh, you remembered!

16:49.341 --> 16:50.509
Wanna get some air?

16:51.010 --> 16:52.469
Oh God, yes.

16:56.306 --> 16:58.183
Bob. Nobody's relaxed.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.355
Seems like you might have had
a rough night, kiddo.

17:04.231 --> 17:07.067
I've only been 15 for a day,
and so far I don't like it.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.861
I mean, nothing's gone right.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.738
It's like I don't know what I'm doing.

17:10.821 --> 17:11.822
Well,

17:12.823 --> 17:15.075
everything's not gonna go right.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.911
Give yourself a break.
You're half dumbass.

17:21.373 --> 17:22.207
It's just…

17:22.708 --> 17:26.295
Everyone else seems to have it all
figured out and I'm just making it all up.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.631
Well, I hate to break it to you, kid,

17:29.715 --> 17:34.303
but we're all just making it up
as we go along.

17:35.262 --> 17:37.056
So don't be so hard on yourself.

17:38.182 --> 17:39.141
Thanks, Grandpa.

17:41.268 --> 17:42.394
Oh. Hey, wait.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.271
Don't you want your present?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.948
A car? You got me a car?

17:55.032 --> 17:56.784
It belonged to your father.

17:57.493 --> 18:01.288
Tomorrow, we'll get your learner's permit,
and I'll teach you how to drive. Okay?

18:01.955 --> 18:03.290
Thank you, Grandpa.

18:03.373 --> 18:05.250
This is the best present I've ever gotten.

18:05.334 --> 18:06.418
Oh…

18:07.002 --> 18:09.046
Be sure to say that to Grandpa Bob.

18:10.547 --> 18:12.257
Happy birthday, kiddo.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.679
You gave her the Vista Cruiser?

18:18.847 --> 18:21.809
Man, you really creamed my jeans.

18:25.020 --> 18:28.190
Can't you even lose like a normal person?

18:29.316 --> 18:31.652
Now, Red, it wasn't a competition.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.282
I wanted to do something nice for Leia.

18:37.991 --> 18:40.953
You guys are lucky
to spend all this time with her.

18:41.662 --> 18:45.666
I don't want her
to forget about her ol' Grandpa Bob.

18:45.749 --> 18:46.834
Oh.

18:47.668 --> 18:48.585
Damn it.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.296
You're a good man, Bob.

18:52.714 --> 18:55.092
Annoying as hell, but a good man.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.886
Leia is lucky to have you.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.597
You guys are makin' me emotional.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.059
And I never cry.

19:05.727 --> 19:07.813
Bob, you are welcome here anytime.

19:09.189 --> 19:10.190
Ooh.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.484
I gotta see a man about a clam.

19:15.779 --> 19:17.030
"Anytime"?

19:17.990 --> 19:19.241
Red, he's family.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.701
Eric!

19:28.458 --> 19:29.293
Jay?

19:31.503 --> 19:33.255
Hey. Mind if I come in?

19:33.338 --> 19:34.965
Okay, but the party's over.

19:35.966 --> 19:38.844
Yeah. I'm sorry I missed it.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.638
It just didn't feel right
to show up with Serena.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.640
I still don't know why I invited her.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.685
-I just wanted you to be there.
-I wanted to be there too.

19:47.269 --> 19:50.397
But… at least I can wish you
a happy birthday.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.192
You know? Before it's too late.

19:58.822 --> 20:00.741
Whoa. Where did that come from?

20:00.824 --> 20:02.868
I guess I'm just
making it up as I go along.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.833
-You need to break up with Serena.
-Serena who?

20:14.880 --> 20:16.215
Hey, you wanna go for a drive?

20:16.924 --> 20:18.091
Yeah, but I don't have a car.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.551
Not a problem.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.143
-Hey, we kissed.
-I know.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.437
This is the best birthday.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.152
Just be cool.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.238
You mean, for the first time in my life?!
