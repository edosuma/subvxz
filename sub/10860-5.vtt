00:24.640 --> 00:26.720
No sign, as yet.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.840
But there's definitely
something out here.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.880
Livestock gone missing,

00:32.880 --> 00:34.960
strange tracks down by the...
the river.

00:34.960 --> 00:37.280
And the locals are totally freaked.

00:38.360 --> 00:41.280
Well, the locals ARE freaks.
But that's probably unrelated.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.240
(ROARING)

00:47.440 --> 00:49.400
This is it.

00:53.560 --> 00:55.440
Hello?

00:55.440 --> 00:58.000
I can see something!

00:58.000 --> 00:59.880
I can see things... (INDISTINCT)

01:00.720 --> 01:02.520
(ROARING)

01:09.720 --> 01:11.680
(SCREAMS)

01:47.840 --> 01:50.880
Tell me something, Connor. Do you
ever think about your future?

01:50.880 --> 01:53.560
Not really.
I'll just be happy if I've got one.

01:53.560 --> 01:55.680
You won't be surprised to hear
that I've been

01:55.680 --> 01:57.800
monitoring you
for a while now. Have you?

01:57.800 --> 02:01.120
Prospero is conducting
its own anomaly research. Really?

02:01.120 --> 02:04.480
You're wasted in the field. You
should be in the lab - full time.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.920
That's why I want you to come over
and head up my team.

02:06.920 --> 02:09.199
I'll square things away with Lester.

02:09.199 --> 02:13.000
You and I both know
that the animals are a distraction.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.360
It's the anomalies
that really matter. Wow!

02:15.360 --> 02:17.080
That's fantastic.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.840
I have to square it with Abby, but...

02:18.840 --> 02:21.960
Fine. Well, once you have
her permission, come and see me.

02:21.960 --> 02:24.040
No...it's not like
I need her permission.

02:24.040 --> 02:26.160
I can't keep this offer open
indefinitely.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.760
Let me know.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.320
Matt?

02:37.320 --> 02:39.520
Am I boring you?

02:39.520 --> 02:43.040
When I'm reprimanding somebody for
being totally unprofessional and...

02:43.040 --> 02:46.400
stupid...I expect them to
at least pretend they're listening.

02:46.400 --> 02:50.400
Emily thought if she
came in she'd be locked up and
treated like a freak.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.480
Was she wrong?
Not locked up.

02:52.480 --> 02:56.400
Protected. For how long?
For months, for years?

02:56.400 --> 02:58.160
And your way was better, was it?

02:58.160 --> 03:01.200
Play games, keep secrets, leave her
unsupervised and in danger.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.960
How do you suppose she feels now?!
We're wasting time here.

03:03.960 --> 03:06.800
I should be out there looking
for them both. This Ethan guy

03:06.800 --> 03:09.400
is dangerous.
(ALARM)

03:18.640 --> 03:21.080
False alarm?
What's he doing here?

03:23.320 --> 03:25.760
(ALARM RESTARTS)
What the hell is going on?

03:25.760 --> 03:27.760
We're picking up something, but...

03:27.760 --> 03:30.560
the signal is very weak.
Do you mind if I...?

03:33.200 --> 03:36.400
It's an anomaly, but it's unstable.
The energy seems to be

03:36.400 --> 03:39.560
fluctuating - I've never seen that.
Interesting.

03:39.560 --> 03:41.440
We need more detailed information.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.320
Get the team down there.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.800
I'm...sorry, James.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.320
That is...of course...your call.

03:53.240 --> 03:56.360
Well? Get the team down there.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.080
Abby and Connor can handle this.
I need to find Emily and Ethan.

04:12.080 --> 04:15.440
Your place is in the field.
Go on. Don't worry.
We'll clean up your mess.

04:15.440 --> 04:18.600
She's my responsibility.
OUR responsibility.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.760
We're a team. I think it's really
about time you understood that.

04:25.040 --> 04:28.200
Sorry. Did...anybody hear me
give a direct order (?)

04:28.200 --> 04:30.360
Hm?

04:46.560 --> 04:48.600
The places we've been. Hm?

04:49.920 --> 04:52.720
Nine times out of ten,
the human race hadn't even begun.

04:54.120 --> 04:57.880
Gateway after gateway. Millions
of years, millions of miles.

04:57.880 --> 05:01.320
And...my Charlotte dies
in the very city of her birth.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.560
(CLICKS TONGUE REPROACHFULLY)

05:11.720 --> 05:15.400
I've travelled with you for three
years. Don't you think I know
all your tricks?

05:15.400 --> 05:17.920
We don't belong here, Ethan.
Speak for yourself.

05:17.920 --> 05:20.000
Charlotte was my friend too.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.080
Don't you think I'm grieving.
Don't.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.080
Don't compare your feelings to mine.

05:26.240 --> 05:28.360
I loved her.

05:28.360 --> 05:31.840
If you blame me so much for her
death, why don't you just
kill me here now?

05:31.840 --> 05:34.000
All in good time.

05:35.320 --> 05:37.960
What are you going to do?

05:37.960 --> 05:40.680
You and I are the only ones
in this world to have known her.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.680
She deserves a proper funeral.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.280
We're nearly there.

05:51.280 --> 05:54.280
You got a signal yet?
No. The anomaly must've closed.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.760
Or it's too weak to pick up.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.640
Thanks.
So, what do you think I should do?

06:40.640 --> 06:43.720
You've got to admit,
it's a pretty incredible opportunity.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.800
I would rather shower in toxic waste

06:45.800 --> 06:47.920
than get involved
with Philip's lousy job.

06:47.920 --> 06:50.480
Right. I'm sensing you're still
a bit angry with him?

06:51.560 --> 06:53.960
Can't think how
you're getting that idea (!)

07:00.440 --> 07:02.400
Mum.

07:03.240 --> 07:06.240
Mum! He's gone - the guy in the tent.

07:06.240 --> 07:08.920
Good. One less thing to worry about.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.600
No, he's 'gone.' The worm got him.
Ray!

07:13.280 --> 07:16.040
There is no worm. Will you stop?

07:20.560 --> 07:22.520
(DOG BARKING)

07:25.960 --> 07:28.840
Let's see if the locals
have noticed anything unusual.

07:30.320 --> 07:32.760
Jess. Tell Matt we'll be in the pub.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.120
Morning.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.080
Nice day.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.360
I suppose a white wine spritzer's
out of the question?

08:13.240 --> 08:14.880
Thanks (!)

08:14.880 --> 08:18.040
Hey. Hello.
Bit early, isn't it?

08:18.040 --> 08:20.480
Even for you two.

08:22.440 --> 08:25.120
So, Witchfield Cove
has a mythical creature.

08:27.120 --> 08:29.200
I'd love to know more.

08:29.200 --> 08:33.720
Like I told the kid camping up on the
headland - superstitious nonsense.

08:44.760 --> 08:47.040
So, no-one's actually seen
this creature, then.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.960
Only children and drunks
believe in the worm.

08:55.920 --> 08:59.480
Jess. See what you can find out
about the Witchfield worm.

08:59.480 --> 09:01.560
This place is seriously weird.

09:01.560 --> 09:04.920
What's the story with you and Philip?
You were very tight this morning.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.960
Sorry. It's all in confidence.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.640
All right. Fine.
You've bullied it out of me.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.520
Offered me a job at his lab.
His lab?

09:14.520 --> 09:17.000
Philip's doing research work
outside of The Ark?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.760
I really shouldn't say. But...yeah.

09:19.760 --> 09:23.240
It's called Prospero.
And the resources they have there,
they could...

09:23.240 --> 09:25.480
really push this thing forward.

09:25.480 --> 09:27.120
Anything could be possible.

09:28.240 --> 09:30.440
I think I'd like to
see inside Prospero someday.

09:30.440 --> 09:32.800
Well, I'll see what I can do.

09:35.880 --> 09:39.280
Jess says people and livestock have
been going missing here for decades.

09:39.280 --> 09:41.880
Either a creature has been here
all that time...

09:41.880 --> 09:45.200
Or the anomaly keep recurring and
different creatures come through.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.400
Most sightings have been
on the headland. OK.

09:47.400 --> 09:51.080
You check up there.
I'll see if I can find this kid
the barman mentioned.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.200
(FLAPPING OF WINGS)

11:11.920 --> 11:13.760
This place is well creepy.

11:16.600 --> 11:19.520
All we need now is a weird kid
sat on a porch playing a banjo.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.880
(MIMICS A BANJO BEING PLUCKED)

11:33.960 --> 11:35.920
What is it?

11:54.800 --> 11:57.920
I don't know any farm animal
that produces a mucus like that.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.040
Maybe it's a giant snail.

12:01.040 --> 12:03.520
At last a creature
we're gonna be able to outrun (!)

12:42.400 --> 12:44.600
Turn around slowly!

12:51.120 --> 12:53.080
You are on private property!

13:30.100 --> 13:33.260
Now. Put those weapons
on the ground.

13:34.420 --> 13:37.140
They're not really weapons.
Put them on the ground!

13:37.140 --> 13:39.300
Fine. Down!
Putting it down.

13:40.380 --> 13:43.060
And those earpieces - take them out.
Really?

13:43.060 --> 13:45.100
Out! Now!
OK.

13:46.740 --> 13:50.220
Why are you on my land?
You're not police. No.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.260
No, we're not. We're not police.

13:52.260 --> 13:54.100
We're just...

13:54.100 --> 13:56.940
We're just interested in the worm.
That's all.

13:56.940 --> 13:59.580
All the sightings that's...
happened round here.

13:59.580 --> 14:01.660
Tourists, are you?

14:01.660 --> 14:05.420
Carrying weapons like that?
I don't think so.

14:32.420 --> 14:35.220
OK. All right. You want the truth?

14:35.220 --> 14:38.500
Yes. We're a secret
government department.

14:39.940 --> 14:44.540
That worm's a dangerous prehistoric
creature and we're here to capture
it quietly and take it away.

14:44.540 --> 14:46.500
Secret government department?

14:48.420 --> 14:50.420
Prehistoric creature?
(LAUGHS)

14:50.420 --> 14:53.020
Do you take me for an idiot?

14:54.140 --> 14:56.100
No.
Now.

14:56.100 --> 14:57.900
Tell me why you're really here.

14:57.900 --> 14:59.020

15:07.500 --> 15:10.180
You idiot!

15:27.620 --> 15:30.020

I've found body parts in the river.

15:30.020 --> 15:31.980
I need you here now.

15:42.780 --> 15:44.660
Get away from the water!

15:50.900 --> 15:53.740
Get away from the water!

16:22.740 --> 16:25.060
Go! Get away! Go! Move!

16:32.220 --> 16:34.820
I found this on CCTV
near Matt's flat.

16:36.140 --> 16:38.860
What on earth is going on?

16:38.860 --> 16:40.860
He's kidnapping her.

16:40.860 --> 16:43.380
Yes, I can see that.

16:43.380 --> 16:45.820
I mean why do it here?
You know. Why can't he

16:45.820 --> 16:48.380
do this in the Jurassic era,
where it's not my problem?

16:48.380 --> 16:50.780

No, he's still on -

16:50.780 --> 16:53.500
Still on medical leave.
Yeah. Course he is.

16:53.500 --> 16:57.060
Right. Pull Matt out of the field.

17:04.780 --> 17:07.460
Matt, there's news on Emily.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.540
Ethan took her from your flat.
He had a knife.

We'll handle it.
Go.

17:16.780 --> 17:19.740
OK. You take the other bank.
It's bound to come out eventually.

17:32.300 --> 17:34.700
What is is, Jess?
That's my seat.

17:56.020 --> 17:58.020

Gotcha!

We've got a signal.
Yep. Got it. ABBY: Connor!

18:04.700 --> 18:07.300
There's tracks. It came out here.

18:07.300 --> 18:10.740
Forget about the tracks. Prioritise
the anomaly. I want you to find it.

18:10.740 --> 18:13.820
Now!
Disregard that order.

18:13.820 --> 18:16.460
Jess? Tell them to find
and contain the creature.

18:16.460 --> 18:20.100
Something is keeping that anomaly
in its suspended state.

18:20.100 --> 18:23.780
Now, whatever it is might give us
a vital clue as to how

18:23.780 --> 18:27.020
and why they appear. No priority's
greater than human life.

18:27.020 --> 18:29.060
Jess?

18:29.060 --> 18:30.540
Do it.

18:32.740 --> 18:35.860
Connor? Abby? Lester says
keep on the creature's trail.

18:35.860 --> 18:39.500
Connor. You understand
the importance of this.

18:39.500 --> 18:43.340
I want you to get a black box
in front of that anomaly
as soon as possible.

18:43.340 --> 18:45.060
I understand. But -
We'll split up.

18:45.060 --> 18:48.020
Connor can find the anomaly,
I'll get the creature. Not alone.

18:48.020 --> 18:51.140
Matt. Go with her.

Don't go on your own.
Wait for backup. OK?

18:59.340 --> 19:02.660
It'll take too long. OK, stay there.
I'll come. You need some help.

19:02.660 --> 19:05.300
Connor, I can handle it.
I don't need you or backup

19:05.300 --> 19:08.900

how to do my job. OK? Abby!

21:55.620 --> 21:58.780
Any luck with the creature?
(ROARING)

22:00.140 --> 22:02.460
I've found the creature.
Everything's in hand.

22:02.460 --> 22:04.580
Are you sure?
Yep.

22:04.580 --> 22:07.180
Oh, yeah. No problem.

22:07.180 --> 22:09.700
OK. Cool.

22:26.580 --> 22:29.460
Connor's reached the anomaly
and Abby's found the creature.

22:29.460 --> 22:31.340
But I can't watch Matt AND Philip.

22:31.340 --> 22:34.220
Plus, I've now got two
black box signals for Matt.

22:34.220 --> 22:36.140
OK. Right. I'm on it.

22:36.140 --> 22:38.380
You're on it?
Why not me?

22:38.380 --> 22:43.020
Do you even know how the hub works?
Can you use the radio or
the anomaly detector?

22:43.020 --> 22:46.500
Honestly, Jess. If you can manage it,
how hard can it be?

22:50.380 --> 22:52.780
OK. Mm-hm. And erm...

22:52.780 --> 22:54.860
Yep. How do you switch the radio on?

22:54.860 --> 22:56.780
It IS on.
Oh.

22:57.900 --> 23:01.020
I've just set up a secure line
between you and Matt. Okey-dokey.

23:01.020 --> 23:03.380
Matt, can you hear me? Matt?

23:03.380 --> 23:06.420
Jess? Matt can't hear me
and the computer's broken.

23:12.780 --> 23:14.820
It helps if you
put the volume up (!)

23:14.820 --> 23:17.100
Yep. Sarcasm won't
get you promoted, Jess.

23:17.100 --> 23:19.860

Don't think I didn't hear that.

23:19.860 --> 23:22.980
Right. Er... Matt? Can you read me?

23:22.980 --> 23:26.060
Lester? What are you doing there?
Bear with me. I'm the new Jess.

23:26.060 --> 23:31.260
Right. Now, I've got two blinking
dots on the screen, both with
your name on. That can't be right.

23:31.260 --> 23:33.580
Emily must've taken
a black box from my flat.

23:33.580 --> 23:36.060
OK. Er...breaking news.

23:36.060 --> 23:39.860
She's travelling eastbound
on the fast lane of the motorway
at about 80mph.

23:39.860 --> 23:42.660

cars in Victorian times.

The...co-ordinates.
Yes. I'll do that right now.

23:55.340 --> 23:57.420
Philip, it's not here!

23:57.420 --> 24:00.380
Well, according to these readings,
you're...right on top of it.

24:01.900 --> 24:05.140
Course I am. It's underneath me!

24:12.380 --> 24:14.500
We're here.

24:16.340 --> 24:18.540
Matt, they've stopped.
Tower Hill Cemetery.

24:18.540 --> 24:21.060
Cemetery?
She must be moving on foot.

24:23.580 --> 24:25.620
You drove that?

24:25.620 --> 24:27.580

get the creature here.

who ever knew me.

29:20.460 --> 29:22.420

29:33.900 --> 29:37.900
I should've died a hundred times,
but...I didn't.

29:37.900 --> 29:40.660
And I told her
if I ever made it back...

29:40.660 --> 29:42.700
I'd find them.

29:42.700 --> 29:44.900
And I'd make them pay.

29:55.180 --> 29:57.140

30:21.140 --> 30:23.740
Philip, there's
something strange down here.

30:23.740 --> 30:25.980
There's some kind of...white sludge.

30:29.540 --> 30:32.460
It's thick. And it's erm...

30:35.380 --> 30:37.060
It's kind of metallic-looking.

30:42.060 --> 30:44.580
There's something else
coming down from the surface.

30:44.580 --> 30:48.420
What is it?
Well, it's...it's acid, but...

30:50.020 --> 30:52.260
..what the hell
is that doing down here?

30:56.700 --> 30:58.420
The sludge is bismuth.

30:58.420 --> 31:01.780
Pass the energy from an anomaly
through acid and what do you get?

31:01.780 --> 31:05.020
Electrolysis. The longer
the anomaly keeps trying to open...

31:05.020 --> 31:06.900
The more bismuth it creates,

31:06.900 --> 31:08.860
the more the anomaly gets repelled.

31:08.860 --> 31:11.820
So that's what's making the anomaly
unstable - some kind of acid.

31:11.820 --> 31:12.860
Exactly.

I can't get Abby on her comms.

32:38.060 --> 32:41.180
No, but she's OK.
I'm following her tracker signal.

32:41.180 --> 32:43.620
OK. The anomaly's gone.

32:43.620 --> 32:46.260
The signal's there.
It's faint, you just can't see it.

It must be from the farm.

up to something.

41:55.500 --> 41:58.540
You want me to use her as bait?
Matthew.

41:58.540 --> 42:01.780
Harden your heart. Do your job.

42:01.780 --> 42:03.820
Nothing else matters.

42:11.140 --> 42:13.180
Three people died.
Yes.

42:13.180 --> 42:15.420
I'm aware of that.
And I deeply regret it.

42:15.420 --> 42:18.340
But Connor, the data
you recovered today is invaluable.

42:18.340 --> 42:21.060
Data that might help us solve
the riddle of the anomalies.

42:21.060 --> 42:23.900
And if we can do that, countless
lives could be saved. Philip.

42:24.860 --> 42:26.900
About the job offer.

42:26.900 --> 42:29.180
I am unbelievably flattered.

42:29.180 --> 42:31.540
It's just, I...

42:31.540 --> 42:33.980
I wouldn't feel comfortable
in a lab,

42:33.980 --> 42:37.900
knowing that there was other people,
my friends, out there risking
their lives.

42:37.900 --> 42:39.940
It just...

42:39.940 --> 42:41.980
It doesn't sit well with me.

42:41.980 --> 42:44.060
I see.

42:45.860 --> 42:48.020
Well, you're making a big mistake.

42:48.020 --> 42:50.620
That's what I'm afraid of.
What about a compromise?

42:54.620 --> 42:56.620
I still work on your projects...

42:58.380 --> 43:00.420
..but I do it in my spare time?

43:00.420 --> 43:02.380
Connor. It's not a hobby.

43:02.380 --> 43:04.220
I can do both. I know it. I...

43:05.260 --> 43:07.100
I really want this.

43:12.020 --> 43:14.860
OK. We'll have a lab
set up over here.

43:14.860 --> 43:16.900
And Connor...

43:16.900 --> 43:18.780
working for Prospero

43:18.780 --> 43:21.220
is strictly confidential -
and by that,

43:21.220 --> 43:23.700
I mean you don't tell anybody.

43:24.780 --> 43:27.540
Yep.
Not even Abby.

43:28.620 --> 43:30.420
Yep.

43:31.340 --> 43:34.500
I mean, she's not really interested
in this side of things anyway.

43:34.500 --> 43:37.420
So that... I'll be fine.

43:38.500 --> 43:40.340
Welcome aboard.

43:45.900 --> 43:48.660
To sum up, we're looking for
a psychopath.

43:48.660 --> 43:52.180
He murdered at least half a dozen
people before disappearing
without trace.

43:52.180 --> 43:54.020
I know what you're doing, Matt.

43:54.020 --> 43:57.540
I didn't just fall into this job.
I've been preparing for it
my whole life.

43:57.540 --> 43:59.820
Something's gonna happen
with the anomalies.

43:59.820 --> 44:01.900
Everyone's in danger.
You have to believe me!

44:04.660 --> 44:08.380
There's a pressure pad under my foot.
It's attached to that metronome.

44:08.380 --> 44:11.260
And I think that's a bomb.
You get out now. I mean it, Jess!

44:11.260 --> 44:13.260
Emily?
Yeah.

44:13.260 --> 44:16.700
But don't worry. I'm gonna use her
to catch Ethan and then
I'll walk away.

44:16.700 --> 44:18.580
She means nothing to me.
Jenny!
