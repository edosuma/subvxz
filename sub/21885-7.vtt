WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:03.087
Go back to the void, babe.
I'll be there in a minute.

00:03.171 --> 00:04.923
OK. I'll miss you like crazy.
- I'll miss you more.

00:04.964 --> 00:05.840
No.

00:06.216 --> 00:08.551
I'll miss you more. Bye!

00:08.635 --> 00:11.262
It's my first time making someone
so he might be a little bit "off."

00:11.346 --> 00:15.808
Janet, you can't just go around
inventing people.

00:15.892 --> 00:17.227
Get rid of him immediately.

00:17.560 --> 00:18.436
No.

00:18.520 --> 00:20.313
Eleanor told me to find a rebound guy.

00:20.396 --> 00:23.316
I couldn't find one, so I made one.

00:23.399 --> 00:24.859
He's helping me forget about Jason.

00:24.901 --> 00:29.197
Ugh! "Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason."

00:29.280 --> 00:31.908
"Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason."

00:31.991 --> 00:33.701
Ugh! "Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason."
- Honey...

00:33.785 --> 00:35.286
"Jason. Jason. Jason. Jason."
- Babe.

00:35.370 --> 00:37.205
"Jason. Jason. Ja--"
- Babe! Don't be jealous.

00:37.288 --> 00:39.082
I love you now.

00:39.165 --> 00:40.875
And we are going to spend
every second together.

00:40.917 --> 00:43.002
Aw...
- No! No, no, you are not.

00:43.086 --> 00:45.296
Janet, no one can know about...

00:45.838 --> 00:47.382
I'm so sorry, what's your name again?

00:47.465 --> 00:48.466
Derek Hoffstetler.

00:48.550 --> 00:52.220
If anybody finds out about him,
we are doomed.

00:52.303 --> 00:54.514
He has to stay in your void.

00:54.597 --> 00:56.808
It's <i>our</i> void now.

00:56.891 --> 00:59.727
We moved in together.
- What! Can you believe it?

00:59.811 --> 01:03.356
I got my own hanger for my jumpsuit.
- Already? I mean, that's... that's so fast!

01:03.439 --> 01:05.149
Well, when you know, you know.

01:05.233 --> 01:07.569
And we know literally everything.

01:07.652 --> 01:09.737
We are so in sync,
we're finishing each other's...

01:09.821 --> 01:10.989
Derek!
- Ah!

01:20.456 --> 01:21.416
Hey, guys!
- Oh!

01:21.499 --> 01:23.042
Michael, you frightened me.

01:23.126 --> 01:26.421
Jason's making me watch this horror film
about two ex-convicts

01:26.504 --> 01:28.965
who try to rob and murder a neglected child.

01:29.674 --> 01:30.800
<i>Get over here!</i>

01:32.594 --> 01:34.137
Hey, I got some great news.

01:34.220 --> 01:37.307
I've arranged for you to have a weekend
getaway.

01:37.390 --> 01:39.851
I bet you're tired of being cooped up
in this house, aren't you?

01:39.934 --> 01:41.102
I am a bit, actually.

01:41.185 --> 01:44.981
All this time indoors has degraded my skin
from "radiant" to merely "dewy."

01:45.064 --> 01:46.399
Me! Dewy!

01:46.482 --> 01:49.902
Well, there's going to be plenty of sun
and fun at the private campsite

01:49.986 --> 01:51.946
that I set up for you
at the edge of the Neighbourhood.

01:52.030 --> 01:55.825
Here you go. Ah, I told Vicky that I'll be
torturing you for the time being.

01:55.908 --> 01:59.329
So just relax, live it up.
Out you go. Here. Now, sadly...

01:59.412 --> 02:02.999
Janet is still offline, so you...
you can't call her, OK?

02:03.082 --> 02:06.294
The best news is, none of this is suspicious.

02:06.961 --> 02:08.755
<i>I don't know what's going to happen to us.</i>

02:08.838 --> 02:10.673
<i>But I need to tell you something...</i>

02:12.884 --> 02:14.052
<i>I love you.</i>

02:14.135 --> 02:15.845
What are you watching?
- Um...

02:15.928 --> 02:18.056
"Cannonball Run Two."
- Again?

02:18.139 --> 02:20.558
You watch that movie a lot.

02:20.642 --> 02:22.852
Well, it's basically my favourite movie
of all time.

02:23.561 --> 02:26.022
But you can never watch it! This copy's mine.

02:26.105 --> 02:28.107
Uh-oh, I guess I'm still pretty selfish.

02:28.858 --> 02:31.402
Help. I need another ethics lesson, quick!

02:31.486 --> 02:33.821
Very weird energy
coming off of you right now.

02:33.905 --> 02:35.114
Hey, guys. What you doing?

02:35.198 --> 02:36.616
Nothing? Great.

02:36.699 --> 02:39.118
So, Chidi, just want to double check.

02:39.202 --> 02:42.705
How do ethical philosophers
feel about murder?

02:43.247 --> 02:44.248
It's frowned upon.

02:44.332 --> 02:48.211
OK, what if the reason
you want to murder someone

02:48.294 --> 02:50.880
is to make your life easier?
That's OK, right?

02:50.963 --> 02:52.924
Is there a problem here, bud?

02:53.007 --> 02:54.092
OK, I'll just tell you.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.135
Um... no.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.054
Too hard to explain. I'll show you.

02:58.096 --> 02:58.971
Janet.

02:59.013 --> 03:00.390
- Hi there.
- Hey there!

03:00.473 --> 03:01.766
Who the fork is that?

03:01.849 --> 03:05.061
Derek Hoffstetler, PI.
- Derek is my rebound guy.

03:05.144 --> 03:06.396
I made him.

03:07.105 --> 03:10.650
Oh! Did you do that because, um...
of what I said?

03:10.733 --> 03:12.652
Yes. Because of what you said.
- Janet...

03:12.735 --> 03:14.195
Thank you, Eleanor.
- Thank you, Eleanor.

03:14.278 --> 03:16.114
You know, you seem so sad.

03:16.197 --> 03:18.032
Do you want me
to make you a boyfriend too?

03:18.116 --> 03:19.742
Ooh, I could have a brother.
- Yes!

03:19.826 --> 03:21.619
Based on your last 10,000 comments

03:21.661 --> 03:24.205
it would be Stone Cold Steve Austin's head
on Tahani's body.

03:24.288 --> 03:26.457
Or vice versa.
- She's not gonna make you anything.

03:26.833 --> 03:27.959
Janet, that'll be all.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.002
OK. Goodbye. Say goodbye, Derek.

03:30.086 --> 03:33.548
Ah! "Goodbob."
I hope we "same place" again very now.

03:34.757 --> 03:36.592
His brain is wrong.
- Ah-ha!

03:38.594 --> 03:40.680
Well, I definitely understand everything,
so...

03:42.140 --> 03:43.433
No need to explain.

03:44.851 --> 03:46.436
Mm!
- Mm!

03:46.519 --> 03:48.730
Now, the goal is to tap the ball hard enough

03:48.813 --> 03:51.774
that it goes through the wicket,
but not so hard that it goes too far through.

03:51.858 --> 03:56.738
It combines both classic aspects
of British sport - whimsy and restraint.

03:58.448 --> 04:01.159
Oh! So restrained.

04:01.242 --> 04:03.661
You know, I believe it was Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain

04:03.745 --> 04:06.581
who called croquet, "barely a game!"

04:06.664 --> 04:10.668
It's kinda fun, I guess.
But can I teach you a different game?

04:10.835 --> 04:13.379
In this one,
you just whack it as hard as you can

04:13.463 --> 04:15.339
in whatever direction you want!

04:15.423 --> 04:17.091
Jaguars rule!

04:18.634 --> 04:20.344
The Jaguars are very good!

04:20.428 --> 04:22.722
Ooh!
- Whoa, nice!

04:28.644 --> 04:29.520
Mm!

04:32.648 --> 04:34.734
Fore!
- Well done.

04:34.817 --> 04:36.569
OK, here's where I am on this.

04:36.652 --> 04:38.112
We gotta kill Derek.

04:38.863 --> 04:41.991
No, think about it.
What if Vicky calls for Janet

04:42.074 --> 04:43.910
and Derek shows up too?

04:43.993 --> 04:46.078
She's gotta have a lot of questions
that we can't answer.

04:46.162 --> 04:49.832
But Derek does seem
to be helping Janet get over Jason.

04:49.916 --> 04:52.084
Right? No earthquakes since he showed up.

04:52.168 --> 04:55.922
If we get rid of Derek, then maybe Janet
will start glitching again.

04:56.005 --> 05:00.092
OK, if we can't kill Derek,
then we gotta break up Jason and Tahani.

05:00.176 --> 05:03.596
If that relationship ends
then Janet won't feel sad anymore

05:03.679 --> 05:05.473
and maybe she'll get rid of Derek herself.

05:05.556 --> 05:09.185
Girl, you are a messy bench
who loves drama and I am into it.

05:09.268 --> 05:12.730
I'm sorry, Michael.
But that's also ethically kind of dicey.

05:12.814 --> 05:14.023
Here comes the egghead.

05:14.106 --> 05:16.067
Well, look, Jason and Tahani
are happy together

05:16.150 --> 05:19.320
and telling them that he was once married
to Janet might cause them harm.

05:19.403 --> 05:22.573
It's not permissible to...
to ruin their happiness to save ourselves.

05:22.657 --> 05:26.702
Wait, but isn't keeping a secret
from someone basically like lying though?

05:26.786 --> 05:28.037
No, no, it's OK to keep a secret.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.081
As long as that secret isn't harming anyone.

05:30.164 --> 05:32.500
And telling them that secret
might cause harm.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.168
Noice!
- Cool.

05:34.252 --> 05:35.461
Good point, egghead.

05:35.545 --> 05:37.755
I'll tell you what else
would cause them harm.

05:37.839 --> 05:40.716
Getting caught and being sent
to the real Bad Place

05:40.800 --> 05:45.096
to be tortured for eternity,
which will happen if Derek blows our cover.

05:45.179 --> 05:49.559
I know! But we'll also be sent
to the real Bad Place if we do bad things.

05:49.642 --> 05:53.521
I know it's tempting to take a shortcut,
but moral strength is defined

05:53.604 --> 05:56.232
by how we behave in times of stress.

05:56.315 --> 05:59.151
Has anyone ever told you what a drag you are?

05:59.235 --> 06:00.319
Everyone.

06:00.987 --> 06:02.154
Constantly.

06:05.199 --> 06:08.411
I hereby pronounce you... King Jason!

06:09.579 --> 06:10.621
Dope.

06:11.956 --> 06:13.416
Where did you learn how to do this?

06:13.499 --> 06:15.835
The Hertfordshire Academy
for Expressionless Girls.

06:15.918 --> 06:18.337
It was a finishing school I attended
before Oxford.

06:18.921 --> 06:20.381
And then of course the Sorbonne.

06:21.674 --> 06:23.968
You know, I don't think I've ever asked you
where you were educated.

06:24.051 --> 06:27.722
I went to Lynyrd Skynyrd High School
in Northeast Jacksonville

06:27.805 --> 06:30.558
which was really just a bunch
of tugboats tied together.

06:30.641 --> 06:32.143
Didn't you get seasick?

06:32.226 --> 06:35.021
No, sorry.
They were tied together in a junkyard.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.565
It wasn't a very good school.

06:37.982 --> 06:41.152
For most of my classes,
we just sold dirty magazines door to door.

06:41.235 --> 06:46.073
You know, Jason. Every single detail
about your life is deeply disturbing.

06:46.157 --> 06:47.992
And yet, I envy you. Where I...

06:48.075 --> 06:49.994
I was never allowed to goof off.

06:51.329 --> 06:54.332
I never even had a friend
I could just be myself around.

06:54.415 --> 06:56.125
Maybe I can be that friend.

06:57.460 --> 06:59.795
Or your husband!

06:59.879 --> 07:01.213
OK, stop it.

07:01.297 --> 07:02.840
No, no, no, I'm serious.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.634
Will you marry me?

07:07.720 --> 07:09.972
I say we just let sleeping dogs lie.

07:10.056 --> 07:13.726
Tell Janet that Derek can stay,
but she's gotta keep him under wraps

07:13.809 --> 07:15.686
so that none of the other demons find out.

07:15.770 --> 07:19.857
Fine. As long as they fly under the radar,
and Janet stays happy

07:19.941 --> 07:21.150
I think we'll be safe.
- Great.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.526
- Janet!
- Because the truth is...

07:22.610 --> 07:23.736
You always do this!
- ...you don't respect me!

07:23.819 --> 07:26.072
You make a federal case out of everything!
- ...and you never have

07:26.155 --> 07:27.865
because to you I'll always be
"that guy you made!"

07:27.949 --> 07:29.075
Guys, guys, guys! What's going on?

07:29.158 --> 07:31.369
OK, can we not do this
in front of my friends?

07:31.452 --> 07:33.412
Oh, so they're <i>your</i> friends now?

07:33.496 --> 07:35.623
I'm stating a fact. They are your friends.

07:35.706 --> 07:38.584
I don't know these people. I am out of here.

07:38.668 --> 07:41.212
Oh, great, Derek.
- I'm gonna go back to our void

07:41.295 --> 07:43.923
and I'm gonna try
and forget this ever happened.

07:44.006 --> 07:46.133
It is not your void.
- Oh!

07:46.217 --> 07:47.718
It is <i>my</i> void.
- Wow.

07:47.802 --> 07:51.555
I know it's a boundless, barren nothingness,
but you are always there.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.140
Fine, I'll go somewhere else.

07:53.224 --> 07:55.309
Fine!
- No, not fine, don't go somewhere else!

07:56.519 --> 07:57.770
OK. Yeah.

07:58.312 --> 07:59.981
We're forked here, aren't we?

08:01.732 --> 08:02.775
Look, Jason.

08:02.858 --> 08:05.903
You're lovely and I've honestly
had a wonderful time with you

08:05.987 --> 08:07.029
these past few weeks.

08:07.113 --> 08:09.240
But why on Earth would I marry you?

08:09.323 --> 08:12.076
Well, for one thing, we're not on Earth.

08:12.618 --> 08:13.703
Decent point.

08:13.786 --> 08:19.917
Also, we like each other.
And I promise to always be nice to you.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.336
OK.

08:23.254 --> 08:24.296
I'll marry you.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.924
But I need some time
to plan a proper reception.

08:27.008 --> 08:28.050
I mean, where will everyone sit?

08:28.134 --> 08:29.677
Will it Michael and Janet
opposite Chidi and Eleanor

08:29.760 --> 08:31.262
or Michael and Eleanor
opposite Janet and Chidi?

08:31.345 --> 08:33.222
Let's just have it today. At the beach!

08:33.305 --> 08:34.765
The beach is where all the best stuff happens

08:34.849 --> 08:38.644
like, uh... swimsuit issues,
and "Saving Private Ryan"

08:38.728 --> 08:41.647
and "Jersey Shore" and crabs!

08:41.731 --> 08:44.191
OK. Oh, I hope Janet's back online.
- Mm.

08:44.275 --> 08:46.485
- Janet?
- Hi there.

08:47.903 --> 08:51.073
Is everything alright, Janet?
- Yeah. Mm-hm. Everything's fine.

08:51.157 --> 08:52.366
It's OK. Yeah, I'm fine.

08:52.450 --> 08:55.036
So, it's all fine.

08:55.119 --> 08:56.704
How can I help you?

08:56.787 --> 08:58.039
Where? There he is!

08:58.122 --> 08:59.248
- Derek. How are you?
- Derek!

08:59.331 --> 09:00.791
Nice to meet you.
- Derek!

09:00.875 --> 09:02.084
Derek, get down from there!

09:02.168 --> 09:04.920
I am not coming down
because I'm meant to come here.

09:05.004 --> 09:06.756
- I came here on purpose...
- Shh.

09:06.839 --> 09:09.258
...cos this tree is my new house.
This is Derek's house

09:09.341 --> 09:12.261
and Janet's not allowed in,
because I booby-trapped it.

09:12.344 --> 09:13.262
- OK, OK!
- Hi.

09:13.304 --> 09:15.431
Janet! Oh, my God, you're here! Thank, God!

09:15.514 --> 09:18.267
Derek, I am not talking to you right now.

09:18.350 --> 09:19.351
I'm here to announce

09:19.435 --> 09:24.690
that Jason Mendoza and Tahani Al-Jamil
are getting married this evening.

09:26.108 --> 09:29.278
"The ceremony will be private,
but we think it would be totally dope"

09:29.361 --> 09:33.491
"if you biz-natches came
and got turnt up with us afterward."

09:33.574 --> 09:35.284
I think I can guess who wrote the invitation.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.578
How come you never get
this upset at anything I do, Janet?

09:37.661 --> 09:39.622
Do not start with me right now, Derek?

09:39.705 --> 09:41.582
Oh, I will start it.
- No, no, no, don't!

09:41.665 --> 09:45.044
- Oh! Do not avoid me by going to the void.

09:45.127 --> 09:46.504
No, no, no!

09:46.545 --> 09:48.964
What a little bench!
- Argh!

09:49.048 --> 09:51.092
Things are falling apart here.

09:51.175 --> 09:56.347
Chidi, I understand the ethics involved,
but we need to stop that wedding!

09:56.430 --> 09:58.849
We break up Jason and Tahani.

09:58.933 --> 10:02.561
Janet stops being sad. Derek goes away.

10:02.645 --> 10:04.563
Fine, but...

10:05.731 --> 10:07.399
...there's something
called the Doctrine of Double Effect.

10:07.483 --> 10:09.485
In order to remain ethical,
you can't just go into this

10:09.568 --> 10:11.028
with the intention of killing Derek.

10:11.112 --> 10:13.948
Your only goal has to be
to spare Jason and Tahani

10:14.031 --> 10:16.951
from future pain by filling them in
on Jason's past.

10:17.034 --> 10:18.244
No, I gotcha. I gotcha.

10:18.327 --> 10:22.414
So, it's like ethically we should tell Jason
that he used to be married to Janet

10:22.498 --> 10:26.293
and it sure would be terrible
if that ultimately led to Derek's death.

10:26.377 --> 10:27.920
Wink.
- No, the winking is bad.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.464
You should not be winking
or saying the word, "wink."

10:30.548 --> 10:32.800
OK. We really need to kill...

10:33.342 --> 10:37.263
We really need to kill any suspicion
that I wanna murder Derek.

10:37.638 --> 10:38.556
Boom!

10:38.639 --> 10:39.723
Wink!

10:39.807 --> 10:41.392
You shouldn't be winking either.

10:41.725 --> 10:42.601
Guys!

10:43.477 --> 10:45.980
Tahani, you're so smart.

10:46.063 --> 10:50.734
Every day you teach me something new
about art, and history, and...

10:50.818 --> 10:53.404
and why I shouldn't eat
everything that smells good...

10:53.487 --> 10:55.865
because sometimes, it's candles.

10:55.948 --> 10:59.243
You're basically like a hot genius teacher

10:59.326 --> 11:02.371
who sometimes has sex with me, your student.

11:03.455 --> 11:06.542
That used to happen a lot
at Lynyrd Skynyrd High School.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.002
But this time, you won't be arrested.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.380
Oh, I love you, Tahani.

11:12.798 --> 11:15.050
Brap! Brap! Brap! Pew! Pew!

11:16.760 --> 11:21.265
Jason. I never guessed
we'd be where we are today.

11:21.348 --> 11:24.602
Me, a prominent British philanthropist
with award-winning legs

11:24.685 --> 11:28.022
set to marry you,
a swamp-dweller who once asked me

11:28.105 --> 11:31.775
if the presidents on Mount Rushmore
have butts on the other side.

11:32.651 --> 11:35.529
We don't make any sense together.

11:35.613 --> 11:38.782
And yet, when I'm with,
you I can really let my hair down -

11:38.866 --> 11:42.328
metaphorically speaking, of course, since
I'd never have it up in the first place.

11:43.537 --> 11:44.914
I'm not a factory worker.

11:45.497 --> 11:49.585
But you've helped me to see
that there is more to life than just...

11:49.668 --> 11:53.797
appearances. And I can't believe
I'm about to say this, but...

11:54.965 --> 11:56.425
- I think I love--
- Wait!

11:56.508 --> 11:57.927
Stop the ceremony!

11:58.594 --> 12:01.013
This wedding cannot happen.

12:01.096 --> 12:03.098
This is not helpful,
but I have always wanted

12:03.182 --> 12:05.517
to be a part of a wedding
that was stopped dramatically.

12:05.601 --> 12:07.478
We can't get married? Why not?

12:07.561 --> 12:09.688
Because... because...

12:10.606 --> 12:12.483
Hang on a second. I can't do it.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.401
Professor Buzzkill got in my head.

12:14.485 --> 12:17.905
I'm just thinking about all the rules
I have to follow to stay ethical.

12:17.988 --> 12:20.282
Someone else is gonna have to do this,
I... I... No.

12:20.366 --> 12:23.369
Alright, alright, alright.
I hate to be the bearer of bad news...

12:23.452 --> 12:26.872
Uh, I think you mean "Bad News Bear."

12:28.707 --> 12:32.836
Before all the reboots,
Jason was married to Janet, OK?

12:32.920 --> 12:36.340
That's why Janet's been glitching,
because she's sad cos she misses Jason.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.426
In fact, she was so sad she... Well...

12:40.469 --> 12:43.097
- Derek?
- Well, well, well.

12:43.555 --> 12:44.848
Jason Mendoza.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.976
At last we meet.

12:47.059 --> 12:48.978
You've got a lot of nerve, buddy.

12:49.061 --> 12:50.521
No, no, I'm Eleanor, man.
- What?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.357
Everybody, this is Derek.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.901
Janet made Derek as a boyfriend

12:55.985 --> 12:57.945
to try and rebound from Jason.

12:59.863 --> 13:01.615
Oh, I feel quite lightheaded.

13:02.199 --> 13:05.869
Janet, fetch my dizzy couch, please.

13:05.953 --> 13:08.539
Uh, Jason, Tahani.

13:08.622 --> 13:10.582
You guys stay there, OK?

13:10.666 --> 13:13.043
The rest of you, come with me, right now!

13:13.127 --> 13:14.295
So, it's true.

13:14.378 --> 13:16.880
I'm just some sort of consolation prize.
- Derek!

13:16.964 --> 13:20.342
Save the drama for your mama
and technically, I am your mama

13:20.426 --> 13:22.511
and I don't want it!
- Ugh!

13:23.637 --> 13:24.888
Decision time.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.683
Any second now, someone's gonna
realise we're all missing.

13:27.766 --> 13:29.518
Why don't you just reboot all of us?

13:29.601 --> 13:31.979
Tahani and Jason
will forget they were ever in love.

13:32.062 --> 13:34.398
It was a fluky thing,
it probably won't happen again.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.150
And Chidi and I can forget, uh...

13:36.233 --> 13:38.485
Anything we want to forget.

13:38.569 --> 13:43.198
You know just like, uh... personal bloopers
that were embarrassing or, uh...

13:43.282 --> 13:45.367
Days where we were very gassy, etc.

13:45.451 --> 13:47.077
And then we'll meet back in your office.

13:47.161 --> 13:49.955
You bring us up to speed
and we go from there.

13:50.039 --> 13:52.207
No, no, no. We're not starting over.

13:52.291 --> 13:53.542
We've come too far.

13:53.625 --> 13:57.338
Our only options are
to reboot either Janet, or Derek.

13:57.421 --> 14:00.341
Neither one is permissible
as your primary intention.

14:00.424 --> 14:03.218
I mean, the Doctrine of Double Effect,
remember?

14:03.302 --> 14:07.890
Well, man, I'm working with the "Doctrine
of Not Being Completely Effed." OK?

14:07.973 --> 14:11.477
I say we just reboot both of them
and see what shakes out.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.394
OK.

14:16.148 --> 14:18.734
No, no, Michael, Michael,
please, please, I have a son.

14:18.817 --> 14:21.153
He's also my boyfriend.
I have a boyfriend-son.

14:21.236 --> 14:23.405
Please, Michael, no. I was just born today.

14:23.489 --> 14:25.407
I'm a baby.
- I birthed him. I'm a mummy.

14:25.491 --> 14:26.950
Don't kill a baby, Michael.
- Argh!

14:27.034 --> 14:28.369
Would you kill a baby?

14:28.452 --> 14:29.787
I can't stand this. I just hate this!

14:29.870 --> 14:31.663
I don't understand
what you even like about Jason.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.749
What does he have that I don't have?

14:33.832 --> 14:34.875
A soul.

14:35.084 --> 14:36.418
And genitals.
- Ugh!

14:36.502 --> 14:39.463
Here we go, with this whole "no genitals"
thing again.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.132
You're the one that gave me
wind chimes instead of a penis, Janet!

14:42.216 --> 14:44.551
This isn't about your wind-chime penis.

14:44.635 --> 14:46.261
In fact, it's not about you at all.

14:46.345 --> 14:50.015
I don't even know what it is about,
which is very confusing

14:50.099 --> 14:52.976
because the whole point of me
is that I know everything!

14:53.060 --> 14:55.896
Janet, can I speak
to you alone for a second?

14:56.438 --> 14:59.817
OK, look. When you said
you were sad about Jason...

14:59.900 --> 15:02.778
and I suggested, "Hey, find a rebound guy."

15:02.861 --> 15:05.364
It's cos I thought
it was some sort of schoolgirl crush

15:05.447 --> 15:07.825
like just some guy
you made out with a couple of times

15:07.908 --> 15:10.619
in the walk-in freezer
of a Bruegger's Bagels.

15:10.702 --> 15:12.246
Not based on a real example.

15:12.329 --> 15:14.873
Yes, it is. His name was Marcus Bicksburger.

15:14.957 --> 15:16.875
Marcus? I always called him Ben.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.920
Look, I gave you bad advice...
- Uh-huh.

15:20.003 --> 15:22.965
OK? Jason was clearly important to you...
- Yeah.

15:23.048 --> 15:25.551
...and real heartbreak
doesn't have a simple cure.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.177
Mm-mm.

15:27.261 --> 15:29.972
I mean, you will feel better
after some time goes by.

15:30.055 --> 15:32.516
I don't really experience
the passage of time.

15:32.891 --> 15:34.768
I do use it as lotion, occasionally, but...

15:34.852 --> 15:38.105
I mean, weird, but keep doing it
cos your skin looks amazing.

15:38.188 --> 15:39.648
Thank you. Not skin.

15:39.731 --> 15:42.401
The point is, to get through a real
heartbreak

15:42.484 --> 15:45.529
you kind of just have to sit
with your feelings, and mull it over

15:45.612 --> 15:47.114
and power through.

15:48.240 --> 15:51.160
And you have to talk about it. Ugh!

15:51.243 --> 15:53.662
Talking about your feelings is the worst.

15:53.745 --> 15:56.081
It's so much easier
just to find a rebound guy

15:56.165 --> 15:57.458
and have sex about your feelings.

15:57.541 --> 15:59.585
I don't know if I want to talk to Jason
right now.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.628
That's cool. Until then...

16:02.629 --> 16:05.674
if you ever need a friend to talk to,
just know I'm here.

16:06.425 --> 16:08.635
That's really kind of you, Eleanor.
Thank you.

16:09.219 --> 16:12.347
And in case you were wondering,
Marcus is still at that Bruegger's Bagels

16:12.431 --> 16:16.894
and he's the manager now!
- Good for Ben.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.520
Marcus.
- Marcus.

16:19.313 --> 16:21.732
Derek, there's no easy way to say this.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.942
I never should have made you.
- Hm.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.819
I think it's time for you to go away.

16:25.903 --> 16:28.572
I understand because you understand.

16:28.655 --> 16:33.702
Janet, this relationship has been
the best seven hours of my whole life.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.913
It's been the only seven hours
of my whole life.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.289
It's been my whole life.

16:37.372 --> 16:38.749
I made you this morning, we all remember.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.459
OK, you ready to do this?
- Yep.

16:44.546 --> 16:47.508
Janet? What are you doing?

16:47.591 --> 16:49.885
I imbued Derek with some of my thoughts,
and emotions.

16:49.968 --> 16:51.637
This is the only way I can re-absorb them.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.096
It'll just be a minute.

16:54.223 --> 16:57.142
Dang it! That is some hot re-absorbing.

16:57.226 --> 16:59.228
Can you get pregnant from re-absorbing?

17:00.771 --> 17:03.690
Uh-oh. I hear wind chimes.
Look away! Everybody, look away!

17:03.774 --> 17:05.984
I'm gonna keep watching,
but you guys look away!

17:09.154 --> 17:10.239
Goodbye, Derek.

17:10.322 --> 17:13.659
From the moment I made you,
everyone wanted to kill you.

17:14.952 --> 17:16.036
And then I did.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.829
Goodbye, mummy-girlfriend.

17:17.913 --> 17:20.624
- Bye, everybody!
- Derek's going away now.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.044
Does he seem a little bit, uh...

17:24.086 --> 17:25.170
still alive?

17:25.254 --> 17:27.047
Well, he's about as dead as he can be.

17:27.506 --> 17:29.341
Kind of like he's in power-saver mode.

17:29.424 --> 17:30.968
Derek.

17:31.510 --> 17:33.053
Are you worried
you might start glitching again?

17:33.136 --> 17:36.557
No. I think I'll be OK now that I understand
what I'm going through.

17:36.640 --> 17:39.184
And now that I know
I can talk to my friends about it.

17:39.977 --> 17:41.895
OK, I'm gonna toss this steamer trunk

17:41.979 --> 17:43.355
containing the lifeless husk
of my ex-boyfriend

17:43.438 --> 17:46.567
into a remote corner of my limitless void!
Bye, guys!

17:46.650 --> 17:48.277
Derek!

17:50.279 --> 17:52.573
I'm kinda glad we didn't get married today.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.285
Me too.
Perhaps we were rushing things a bit.

17:56.368 --> 17:58.120
I mean we don't even know
that much about each other.

17:58.787 --> 18:00.914
Like, who was the first person you kissed?

18:00.998 --> 18:04.293
The sexy mouse robot
in the Chuck E Cheese band.

18:04.876 --> 18:06.211
Yeah, it was...
- OK, OK.

18:06.295 --> 18:08.297
I think that's probably enough
"getting to know each other" for now.

18:08.380 --> 18:09.631
We'll just take things slow.

18:10.882 --> 18:13.051
I know I'm technically married to Janet.

18:13.135 --> 18:15.679
But I don't remember it at all.

18:17.222 --> 18:19.975
I'm sorry that it puts you
in a weird position.

18:20.058 --> 18:21.893
And I still like you a lot.

18:23.645 --> 18:24.938
Me too.

18:26.648 --> 18:27.983
What happens now?

18:28.900 --> 18:31.987
Don't know. Do you want to try...

18:33.572 --> 18:34.698
re-absorbing me?

18:43.999 --> 18:45.959
Something wrong?
- No.

18:46.835 --> 18:51.590
Yep. I've been keeping a secret from you,
about you.

18:51.673 --> 18:52.758
What is it?

18:52.841 --> 18:55.969
The thing is, it's not even harming you,
and... and... and if I tell you

18:56.053 --> 18:57.763
I feel like it... it might harm you.

18:57.846 --> 18:59.640
So, uh, ethically speaking

18:59.723 --> 19:00.849
I don't think I have to tell you.

19:00.932 --> 19:02.309
Yeah, well...forget all that.

19:02.392 --> 19:04.978
Um, this is freaking me out.
I'm losing my mind. So just tell me.

19:07.230 --> 19:11.193
<i>And you don't need to respond cos
I know you have trouble saying how you feel.</i>

19:11.276 --> 19:12.402
<i>I love you too.</i>

19:17.366 --> 19:18.742
Wow, OK.

19:19.326 --> 19:21.453
You just... said it.

19:21.495 --> 19:26.124
And I just said it, so effortlessly.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.126
I've never been that certain about anything.

19:28.210 --> 19:31.630
I once even tried to rent socks.

19:31.672 --> 19:35.217
How did I say <i>that</i>, that easily?

19:35.676 --> 19:37.678
I mean, I get how <i>you</i> said it.

19:38.637 --> 19:39.930
I'm a total smoke-show.

19:40.806 --> 19:42.557
But how did <i>I</i> say it so easily?

19:44.309 --> 19:48.021
Look, I don't want to talk about this,
but after everything that's happened today

19:48.105 --> 19:51.858
I think we gotta.
So, let's just get it all out there.

19:51.942 --> 19:52.984
Um...

19:54.152 --> 19:55.904
Well, yeah, I guess, do you...

19:55.987 --> 20:00.325
I don't know, do you have any feelings
like that for me again now?

20:02.744 --> 20:05.539
I'm... I'm sorry, but I don't think I do.

20:06.957 --> 20:08.625
S... "sorry"? Why are you sorry?

20:08.709 --> 20:12.129
Cos I'm relieved, because I don't either.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.922
So, all good.

20:14.005 --> 20:16.633
I mean, I, I... I feel incredibly close
to you...

20:16.717 --> 20:18.760
No, no, no! Dude, dude, you don't...
- ...in many ways.

20:18.844 --> 20:22.514
...need to explain yourself.
We are on the same page. OK. Good.

20:22.597 --> 20:24.850
Hey, guys. Sorry, I, uh...

20:24.933 --> 20:25.976
I know it's late.

20:26.727 --> 20:28.145
Can I talk to Eleanor for a second?

20:28.228 --> 20:29.563
Actually, we're chatting
about something right now.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.565
No, it's cool. We were wrapping it up.
Good talk, bro.

20:34.401 --> 20:35.527
What's on your mind?

20:35.610 --> 20:38.113
Uh... well.

20:38.196 --> 20:41.241
Being ethical... it's hard.

20:41.324 --> 20:42.701
And I kind of hate it.

20:42.784 --> 20:45.996
When's it get easier?
- Why are you asking me?

20:46.079 --> 20:47.372
Why don't you ask Chidi?

20:47.456 --> 20:50.917
He's the ethics master. I'm just a newbie
and I still kinda suck at it.

20:51.001 --> 20:53.336
Yeah. That's why I'm asking you.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.381
I designed this entire torture chamber

20:56.465 --> 20:59.968
around the absolute certainty
that when the going got tough

21:00.051 --> 21:03.138
you would give up.
That was the signature Shellstrop move!

21:03.221 --> 21:06.266
Do you remember once
when your "change oil" light came on?

21:06.349 --> 21:09.019
You just abandoned your car
in a parking garage.

21:09.102 --> 21:10.896
Of course.
- But here...

21:10.979 --> 21:15.108
faced with the toughest challenges
I could throw at you...

21:15.192 --> 21:19.237
you never once stopped trying to become
a better person, and I just...

21:20.989 --> 21:21.865
Why?

21:21.948 --> 21:23.658
I... I don't know.

21:23.742 --> 21:26.661
I mean, whenever
I would do something crappy on Earth

21:26.745 --> 21:30.248
there would be a little tiny voice
in the back of my head, that would say

21:30.332 --> 21:34.878
"Eleanor, don't grab that handful of olives
from the salad bar."

21:34.961 --> 21:36.046
You know, "You didn't pay for that."

21:36.129 --> 21:39.633
Or "Eleanor, don't spit those olive pits
onto the floor of the grocery store."

21:39.716 --> 21:40.592
"That's not cool."

21:40.675 --> 21:45.138
Or "Eleanor, that old man just
slipped on your olive pit and he fell down."

21:45.222 --> 21:48.350
"Don't use the fact that everyone's
distracted to go back and steal more olives."

21:48.433 --> 21:50.060
I get it.
- The thing is...

21:50.644 --> 21:52.979
I still did those things.

21:53.063 --> 21:54.856
I just ignored the voice.

21:55.774 --> 21:58.109
This ethics stuff - it's hard.

21:58.193 --> 22:01.613
And it's confusing. It is such a buzzkill.

22:02.906 --> 22:05.492
But it does get rid of the little voice.

22:05.575 --> 22:08.036
Because at least
I'm trying to do the right thing

22:08.119 --> 22:09.704
instead of the crappy thing, and...

22:09.788 --> 22:12.958
I gotta say, man,
I don't miss the little voice.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.168
Well...

22:16.628 --> 22:18.088
Thank you for helping me today.

22:21.091 --> 22:26.054
Wow. You, uh... you really
did just come here to chat, didn't you?

22:26.137 --> 22:28.807
Just shootin' the shirt
with your old pal, Eleanor.

22:28.890 --> 22:30.225
I guess so, yeah, why?

22:30.308 --> 22:32.894
It's just a very human-y thing to do.

22:33.728 --> 22:35.522
Stick with the programme, demon buddy.

22:35.605 --> 22:38.775
I really feel like things are starting
to click in our little study group.

22:40.777 --> 22:41.903
Mm.

22:44.656 --> 22:47.492
Hello, Michael. Shut the door.

22:47.617 --> 22:48.618
Have a seat.
