00:02.436 --> 00:03.604
Previously on
Young Sheldon...

00:03.704 --> 00:04.672
I understand
you're moving forward

00:04.772 --> 00:05.706
with Sheldon's grant database.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.241
I was an intrinsic part of that.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.942
Hmm. Sheldon didn't mention you.

00:09.043 --> 00:11.945
Of course he didn't, that
pint-sized little credit hog.

00:12.046 --> 00:13.013
What did you decide?

00:13.114 --> 00:14.014
I'm cutting everybody out

00:14.115 --> 00:15.283
and doing this myself.

00:15.383 --> 00:16.750
What?
I don't need
the university,

00:16.850 --> 00:18.219
and I don't need
Dr. Linkletter.

00:18.319 --> 00:19.920
How are you gonna pay
for all this?

00:20.020 --> 00:22.090
I'll find private investors.
They can pay for it

00:22.190 --> 00:23.824
on the condition I'm left alone.

00:23.924 --> 00:26.627
Are you sure you don't want to
think about this a little more?

00:26.727 --> 00:28.229
Perhaps you're right.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.531
Done. I'm good.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.869
Good morning.
I'm Sheldon Cooper.

00:35.969 --> 00:38.106
Thank you for taking
the time to hear my proposal.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.873
I have some handouts.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.143
I-I'm sorry, who are you?

00:42.243 --> 00:43.777
Oh, I'm... Sheldon Cooper.

00:43.877 --> 00:47.047
I'm here to pitch my idea for
a grant computer database.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.582
How old are you?

00:48.682 --> 00:50.584
When you hear my presentation,
I believe you'll realize

00:50.684 --> 00:52.052
my age is irrelevant.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.788
So there's no adult with you?

00:54.888 --> 00:58.326
Well, my mom drove me here, but
I told her to wait in the car.

00:59.427 --> 01:00.528
Is this a joke?

01:00.628 --> 01:02.029
I assure you, it's not.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.531
When I make jokes,
I follow them with a "bazinga"

01:03.631 --> 01:04.532
so it's clear.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.767
Like this: "Bazinga."

01:07.968 --> 01:10.638
How long does it take
to grow a mustache?

01:11.705 --> 01:14.542
* Nobody else
is stronger than I am *

01:14.642 --> 01:17.278
* Yesterday I moved a mountain *

01:17.378 --> 01:19.613
* I bet I could be your hero *

01:19.713 --> 01:22.716
* I am a mighty little man *

01:22.816 --> 01:26.887
* I am a mighty little man. *

01:29.723 --> 01:31.492
(indistinct chatter)

01:31.592 --> 01:33.461
I know we've lost
to Pineview a lot

01:33.561 --> 01:36.164
over the years,
but that's in the past.

01:36.264 --> 01:37.631
You're a different
team now.

01:37.731 --> 01:38.732
So just stick
to the plan,

01:38.832 --> 01:40.901
and you're gonna
come out on top.

01:41.001 --> 01:43.036
And Stevens, I don't care
how uncomfortable you are,

01:43.137 --> 01:44.172
you're wearin' your cup tonight.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.739
(laughter)
All right,

01:45.839 --> 01:47.841
you boys have
worked hard for this.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.843
Now, let's get out there
and get that W.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.279
Yeah!
Let's go!
Yes, sir!

01:51.379 --> 01:52.580
ROB: Looking like
some winners in here.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.448
Hey, y'all. George.

01:54.548 --> 01:57.084
Pastor Rob, you made it.
Of course.

01:57.185 --> 01:58.486
And... why?

01:58.586 --> 02:00.421
Coach Wilkins invited me
to pray with the kids

02:00.521 --> 02:01.489
before the game.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.624
Oh. And... why?

02:03.724 --> 02:05.326
Can't hurt to have
a little extra help

02:05.426 --> 02:06.594
from the big man upstairs.

02:06.694 --> 02:07.661
Amen to that.

02:07.761 --> 02:08.962
(claps hands) All right, guys.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.231
Circle up.

02:11.031 --> 02:12.200
ROB: Lord, we lift
these players...

02:12.300 --> 02:14.101
What the hell, Wayne?

02:14.202 --> 02:16.136
What? Lots of teams do it.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.472
Well, why him?
He's a good guy.

02:18.572 --> 02:21.742
He's been counseling me
since Darlene left.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.511
(sighs)

02:23.611 --> 02:26.347
Fine, just... next time,
give me a heads-up.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.048
Yeah, you're right,
I'm sorry.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.283
It's okay,
forget about it.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.219
Amen!
PLAYERS: Amen!

02:31.319 --> 02:32.853
All right, hands in,

02:32.953 --> 02:33.954
"team" on three!

02:34.054 --> 02:35.155
One, two, three!

02:35.256 --> 02:36.390
ALL: Team!
Let's go!

02:36.490 --> 02:38.426
(whooping, cheering)

02:38.526 --> 02:40.160
Yeah!
All right, boys, go get 'em.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.296
He did "team on three."

02:42.396 --> 02:43.364
I do "team on three."

02:43.464 --> 02:44.965
I'll do it with ya.
Wh...

02:45.065 --> 02:46.867
It's not the same.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.971
Hey, how was the game?

02:51.071 --> 02:52.773
Fine.

02:52.873 --> 02:55.142
Well, Pineview's a tough team.

02:55.243 --> 02:56.377
Don't beat yourself up.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.712
No, we won.

02:59.480 --> 03:02.783
I want to be happy,
but your face is confusing me.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.152
We destroyed 'em.
It was a blowout.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.256
That doesn't clear things up.

03:09.056 --> 03:12.025
Pastor Rob prayed with
the team before the game

03:12.125 --> 03:14.562
and everyone thinks
he's the reason we won.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.697
So you're mad he helped you win?

03:16.797 --> 03:18.165
He didn't help!

03:18.266 --> 03:20.734
I coached that team up,
I designed the game plan.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.303
But who do they hoist
on their shoulders

03:22.403 --> 03:23.537
after the final whistle?

03:23.637 --> 03:26.006
Well...

03:26.106 --> 03:28.008
What?

03:29.142 --> 03:30.744
Come on.

03:33.113 --> 03:35.283
MISSY:
Of course I like cars.

03:35.383 --> 03:36.984
Most girls don't?

03:37.084 --> 03:38.586
(knocking at door)
Well, I do.

03:38.686 --> 03:41.054
Which one's your favorite?

03:41.154 --> 03:42.055
Yeah, totally.

03:42.155 --> 03:43.491
Ford's the best.
(knocking)

03:43.591 --> 03:45.225
SHELDON: Missy,
I need to use the phone.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.460
Too bad.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.461
SHELDON:
This is important.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.762
Can't you lie to boys

03:48.862 --> 03:50.498
about liking cars
some other time?

03:50.598 --> 03:53.100
I gotta go. Bye.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.769
Here.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.972
Wait, don't go away.
I need your help.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.741
This is stupid.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.810
Do you want the money or not?

04:04.545 --> 04:07.180
(accent): Hello?
Yes, I have Sheldon Cooper

04:07.281 --> 04:08.949
calling for Mr. Jennings.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.618
Yes, we'll hold.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.256
(deeper voice):
Hello, Mr. Jennings.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.625
Mr. Cooper here.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.394
Yes, I know we have
an appointment for tomorrow,

04:20.494 --> 04:22.863
but I thought, why wait
to do this face-to-face

04:22.963 --> 04:25.265
when we could do it
over the phone? Ha, ha.

04:25.366 --> 04:28.001
Well, it's just that
there's been so much interest

04:28.101 --> 04:30.237
in the grant database,
I wanted to make sure that you

04:30.338 --> 04:31.939
got a chance to hear it first.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.342
Excellent. Well...

04:34.442 --> 04:36.344
(dialing)

04:36.444 --> 04:37.945
I'm on the phone.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.347
Oh. Sorry, baby.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.649
Uh, so you can hang up now.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.551
Your voice sounds funny,

04:43.651 --> 04:44.985
are you coming down with a cold?

04:45.085 --> 04:46.554
No, I'm fine.

04:46.654 --> 04:48.055
This is my normal adult voice.

04:48.155 --> 04:51.091
I guess I just miss
that sweet little boy voice.

04:51.191 --> 04:52.526
SHELDON:
Mom!

04:52.626 --> 04:54.562
Wh-- I-It doesn't matter
how old I am, Mr. Jennings,

04:54.662 --> 04:56.830
because
I'm really, really smart.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.966
Oh, is this about
his database thingy?

04:59.066 --> 05:01.635
He is so excited about that

05:01.735 --> 05:03.504
I could barely get him
to bed last night.

05:03.604 --> 05:04.972
Mom!

05:06.474 --> 05:07.641
(laughter)

05:07.741 --> 05:08.709
Oh. As long as
I've been teaching here,

05:08.809 --> 05:10.177
we have never beaten Pineview.

05:10.277 --> 05:11.612
Oh, well, I can't
take credit for that.

05:11.712 --> 05:12.946
Gotta give it
to the big guy.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.147
George?

05:14.247 --> 05:15.816
Oh, I meant
the big guy upstairs,

05:15.916 --> 05:17.217
but yeah, him, too.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.588
So when you baptize someone,

05:20.688 --> 05:22.856
are you only wearing
swim trunks or...?

05:22.956 --> 05:24.658
Oh, no, no, fully covered.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.794
So is it, like, in a pool...

05:26.894 --> 05:28.529
or a hot tub or...

05:28.629 --> 05:29.663
Um...

05:29.763 --> 05:31.432
I thought you were Mormon.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.133
Mind your business.
Okay.

05:33.233 --> 05:34.368
Good mornin'.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.369
Hey, George.
Hey.

05:35.469 --> 05:36.437
Hey, good morning, George.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.538
What's going on here?

05:37.638 --> 05:39.106
Just talking
about Friday's game.

05:39.206 --> 05:41.609
The paper called it
the "Medford Miracle."

05:41.709 --> 05:43.611
No miracle,
just good coaching.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.212
Let's not forget
about those kids--

05:45.312 --> 05:47.080
I mean, they really
played their hearts out.
Mm. Yeah.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.216
One of the things
I coached them to do.

05:49.316 --> 05:52.453
Of course. I'm just saying
it's a team effort.

05:52.553 --> 05:53.954
I'm sorry,
what are you doin' here?

05:54.054 --> 05:55.889
Oh. A couple of
the players wanted to talk,

05:55.989 --> 05:58.492
so I'm waiting for them
to have a free period.

05:58.592 --> 05:59.593
Talk about what?

05:59.693 --> 06:01.629
Anything they want.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.296
Just here to listen.

06:04.297 --> 06:05.699
He's a good listener, George.

06:05.799 --> 06:06.967
If you ever need someone
to talk to--

06:07.067 --> 06:08.035
I'm fine.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.637
Sure.

06:10.538 --> 06:12.305
A man who listens.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.306
Hmm.

06:13.407 --> 06:14.374
(chuckles weakly)

06:14.475 --> 06:16.109
HUTCHINS:
Mmm-mm-mm.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.045
So what's up?

06:18.812 --> 06:20.748
Well, I was hoping
I could maybe

06:20.848 --> 06:22.450
bring a friend over
to watch a movie.

06:22.550 --> 06:23.717
Mm-hmm.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.886
And would that friend
be a-a boy?

06:25.986 --> 06:27.755
Yeah, his name is Dean
and he's so cool,

06:27.855 --> 06:29.022
and if I bring him to my house,

06:29.122 --> 06:30.290
my family's gonna embarrass me

06:30.390 --> 06:31.592
and he's never gonna
talk to me again.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.594
Calm down,
he can come here.

06:33.694 --> 06:34.762
Thank you.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.530
But I have some rules.
Anything.

06:36.630 --> 06:37.598
Okay, first rule,

06:37.698 --> 06:39.600
you can sit on the same couch,

06:39.700 --> 06:41.469
but separate cushions.

06:41.569 --> 06:42.736
And no crossing the line.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.705
Deal.
I'm not done.

06:45.606 --> 06:46.807
I will leave you alone,

06:46.907 --> 06:49.276
but I will
cross through occasionally,

06:49.376 --> 06:50.644
unannounced

06:50.744 --> 06:52.946
and I better not see
any scooting, scurrying

06:53.046 --> 06:54.281
or resetting of pillows.

06:54.381 --> 06:55.282
No problem.

06:55.382 --> 06:56.850
The movie can be PG-13,

06:56.950 --> 06:58.619
but the date has to stay G.

06:58.719 --> 07:01.321
I promise.
All right, then.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.091
Thank you, you're
the best meemaw ever.
Yeah, I know.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.426
And just so you know,
Little Mermaid is rated G,

07:06.527 --> 07:08.261
and they totally kiss.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.098
On the lips.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.634
SHELDON:
No one will even
listen to my ideas.

07:13.734 --> 07:14.835
I'm being
discriminated against

07:14.935 --> 07:15.903
because I'm too young.

07:16.003 --> 07:17.905
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.272
I can't wait
till I'm your age

07:19.372 --> 07:21.074
and people treat me
with respect and reverence.

07:21.174 --> 07:24.111
Sometimes older people get
discriminated against, too.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.780
For what? Getting smaller
and cuter year after year?

07:26.880 --> 07:28.516
Look at you.

07:28.616 --> 07:29.917
Well, sometimes people assume,

07:30.017 --> 07:32.185
because of my age,
that I'm out of touch,

07:32.285 --> 07:34.855
that I, uh,
don't know how to use

07:34.955 --> 07:37.891
new technologies,
that I, uh...

07:37.991 --> 07:39.993
Hold on, there's a third one.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.361
So I'm too young
and you're too old?

07:41.461 --> 07:43.296
If you take the mean
of both our ages,

07:43.396 --> 07:44.998
we'd be a formidable 41.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.433
Hmm.

07:49.703 --> 07:50.938
My name is Sheldon Cooper

07:51.038 --> 07:52.673
and this is my partner,
Dr. John Sturgis.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.374
Greetings.
With us,

07:54.474 --> 07:56.343
you get both youth
and experience.

07:56.443 --> 07:59.547
Oh, by the way,
I remembered that third thing.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.014
I'll tell you later.

08:08.522 --> 08:09.957
So once this is
up and running,

08:10.057 --> 08:11.391
anyone with a computer
and a modem can have access

08:11.491 --> 08:12.760
to every grant
offered worldwide.

08:12.860 --> 08:17.264
And you can charge
for access on both sides.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.767
As the kids like to say,
ka-ching.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.501
That's the sound
of a cash register,

08:21.602 --> 08:23.403
in case the onomatopoeia
was unclear.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.272
Sounds like this could be
very lucrative.

08:25.372 --> 08:26.373
(whispers):
It was clear.

08:26.473 --> 08:27.407
LOCKHART:
How soon do you think

08:27.507 --> 08:28.676
you could have a prototype?

08:28.776 --> 08:30.477
Well, working around
my class schedule

08:30.578 --> 08:32.813
and a sensible bedtime,
I think within a year.

08:32.913 --> 08:35.182
If we fund this, we'd expect you
to work on it full-time.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.184
We don't want someone else
beating us to the punch.

08:37.284 --> 08:41.321
I suppose I could, uh, take
a sabbatical from teaching,

08:41.421 --> 08:43.523
but my bedtime
is also quite rigid.

08:43.624 --> 08:46.326
Look, building a company
is not a part-time endeavor.

08:46.426 --> 08:48.929
We need to know our partners
are as committed as we are.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.864
So you want me
to drop out of college?

08:50.964 --> 08:53.000
Of course not.
We want to give you money

08:53.100 --> 08:54.201
to build a grant database.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.203
I guess
the question is...

08:56.303 --> 08:57.437
what do you want?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.707
Well, I-I want that too,

08:59.807 --> 09:02.342
but I should probably
ask my mom.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.279
My mom is long dead, so...

09:06.379 --> 09:08.415
I'm good to go.

09:08.515 --> 09:09.817
SHELDON:
Good news.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.952
We found investors
for the grant database.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.186
Oh, honey, that's great.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.022
And even more good news--
you no longer have

09:15.122 --> 09:17.891
to drive me to school, because
I'm dropping out to work on it.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.559
What? No, you're not.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.428
But they won't fund
the project unless

09:21.528 --> 09:22.730
I'm working on it full-time.

09:22.830 --> 09:25.165
I don't care,
you're finishing college.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.634
But you let him drop out.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.602
And look how
his life turned out.

09:28.702 --> 09:29.569
Hey.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.871
I'm sorry, Sheldon,

09:30.971 --> 09:32.305
but you're gonna have
to tell them no.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.707
I got a job

09:33.807 --> 09:35.275
and a cool garage
to live in.
(sighs)

09:35.375 --> 09:37.177
This doesn't have to be
permanent. I can always go back.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.847
People always say that,
and then life gets in the way.

09:39.947 --> 09:42.082
I was gonna go to college
after I had Georgie,

09:42.182 --> 09:43.350
and then I didn't.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.185
And look how
her life turned out.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.320
This discussion is over.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.388
This is so unfair.

09:48.488 --> 09:49.522
What's going on?

09:49.623 --> 09:50.924
Sheldon wants
to quit college.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.293
So I'm the only one
who's not a dropout?

09:53.393 --> 09:54.662
Who saw that coming?

09:55.495 --> 09:56.864
(TV playing softly)

09:56.964 --> 09:58.365
Hey, Coach.

09:58.465 --> 09:59.833
You got a sec?

10:00.634 --> 10:03.203
I'm trying to get through
this game tape on Jasper.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.437
We're playing them on Friday.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.473
Oh, I know,
I'll-I'll be there.

10:06.573 --> 10:07.474
Praying for you.

10:07.574 --> 10:09.643
Great.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.812
Heck of a
practice today.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.613
Yeah? What practice
were you watching?

10:13.714 --> 10:15.082
They were
soft as noodles out there.

10:15.182 --> 10:18.852
Yeah. Yeah, I heard you
yell that a few times.

10:21.855 --> 10:24.658
What can I do for ya, Rob?

10:24.758 --> 10:26.994
Well, you know I counsel
a few of your players.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.261
Mm-hmm.
And, uh,

10:28.361 --> 10:30.263
a-a couple of them
have mentioned that

10:30.363 --> 10:33.133
maybe you've been a little
hard on 'em this week.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.267
Really?

10:34.367 --> 10:35.402
Was it Stevens?

10:35.502 --> 10:36.536
I bet it was Stevens.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.505
It doesn't matter.

10:38.605 --> 10:39.773
Thought I should
let you know.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.141
They think I've been hard,

10:41.241 --> 10:42.575
they haven't seen "hard" yet.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.813
It's just...
I find that some kids

10:45.913 --> 10:47.815
respond better
to encouragement.

10:47.915 --> 10:50.250
This isn't Sunday school,
this is football.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.719
Oh, hey. I get it.

10:51.819 --> 10:54.221
I was an athlete in high
school. Varsity tennis.

10:55.088 --> 10:55.856
Okay.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.157
Almost went to state.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.291
I'm sure you did.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.260
And I'm sure tennis
is considered

11:00.360 --> 11:02.362
a real sport...
somewhere.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.833
But this is Texas, and this
game on Friday is gonna be

11:05.933 --> 11:07.367
a street fight,
and it is my job

11:07.467 --> 11:08.802
to make sure these boys
are ready for it.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.603
Yeah, we got the same
goal here, George.

11:10.704 --> 11:13.640
Really? You also want you
to get out of my office?

11:15.408 --> 11:17.610
All right, I'll go.

11:17.711 --> 11:18.912
(chuckles)

11:19.012 --> 11:21.148
I'm sorry if I
overstepped. I just...

11:21.248 --> 11:23.717
hope you think about
what I said, and, uh...

11:23.817 --> 11:25.052
ball's in your court.

11:25.152 --> 11:26.987
(clicks tongue)

11:27.788 --> 11:29.723
Yeah, I'm not doin' that back.

11:32.125 --> 11:35.228
Okay. I'm just
gonna set this

11:35.328 --> 11:38.165
right here
between you.

11:38.265 --> 11:41.468
And remember, just
one hand at a time.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.236
Thank you, Meemaw.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.105
I'll just be upstairs,

11:45.205 --> 11:47.107
unless I'm downstairs.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.575
(whispers):
I could be anywhere.

11:48.675 --> 11:49.910
Got it.

11:51.278 --> 11:52.579
Sorry about her.
Oh, no,

11:52.679 --> 11:54.447
I like that you and
your grandma are so close.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.750
You do?
I think it's cool.

11:56.850 --> 11:59.787
Yeah, she's cool.
We're pretty close.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.354
I was close to my grandma, too.

12:01.454 --> 12:02.790
Grandmas are the best.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.357
Yeah.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.994
Mine died earlier this year.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.929
Oh.

12:09.029 --> 12:09.863
I'm sorry.

12:09.963 --> 12:11.799
Yeah, it's...
it's okay.

12:13.666 --> 12:14.835
So, should we
start the movie?

12:14.935 --> 12:16.703
Totally.

12:18.305 --> 12:21.074
(movie playing quietly)

12:21.909 --> 12:24.211
Is she just gonna
sit upstairs by herself?

12:24.311 --> 12:25.345
Oh, yeah, she loves it.

12:25.445 --> 12:26.679
Probably knitting.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.816
My grandma knitted.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.221
Hey, think she'd
want to watch with us?

12:34.321 --> 12:35.688
Oh, no, she's fine.

12:35.789 --> 12:38.091
I just know
if I had the chance

12:38.191 --> 12:40.828
to watch one more movie
with my grandma,

12:40.928 --> 12:43.030
I'd hate to pass it up.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.397
(sighs)

12:44.497 --> 12:46.066
Meemaw!

12:47.734 --> 12:49.970
So what's goin' on here?

12:50.770 --> 12:52.572
I really don't know.

12:53.340 --> 12:56.009
Well, how are the boys
looking for Friday?

12:56.109 --> 12:57.244
Good.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.711
Just good?

12:58.812 --> 13:01.348
'Cause I have a bet
with the Jasper principal

13:01.448 --> 13:04.584
and I really don't want
to wear a pink cowboy hat

13:04.684 --> 13:05.785
to the next pep rally.
(chuckles)

13:05.886 --> 13:07.888
I gotta be honest,
it'd be going better

13:07.988 --> 13:09.857
if Pastor Rob would
stay in his lane.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.724
Well, I thought the kids
liked having him around.

13:11.825 --> 13:14.294
Yeah, 'cause he's filling
their heads with junk

13:14.394 --> 13:16.663
like they should be treated nice
and not get yelled at.

13:16.763 --> 13:19.199
Oh. Well, he's one
of those, huh?

13:19.299 --> 13:20.200
Yeah.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.069
So I can get rid of him?

13:22.169 --> 13:23.203
Hell no.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.072
We just beat
Pineview by 28 points.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.674
You telling me God didn't
have anything to do with that?

13:27.774 --> 13:29.409
Well, I think
I deserve a little credit.

13:29.509 --> 13:30.777
Fine, good job.

13:30.878 --> 13:33.346
Mustache boy stays.
Oh, come on.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.149
George, you don't mess
with a winning streak.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.551
So as long as we're winning
I'm stuck with this guy?

13:38.651 --> 13:39.686
That's right.

13:39.786 --> 13:40.820
What if we lose?

13:40.921 --> 13:42.022
Then you're gonna
get murdered

13:42.122 --> 13:44.191
by a guy wearing
a pink cowboy hat.

13:47.394 --> 13:48.896
Dad, I have a
question for you.
(sighs)

13:48.996 --> 13:50.597
Not a good time, Sheldon.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.332
Please, it's really important.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.267
Whatever it is, fine.

13:55.102 --> 13:57.704
Mom, Dad said I could
drop out of college!

13:57.804 --> 13:59.873
What?
MARY:
George!

14:06.613 --> 14:07.780
My parents are being
completely unreasonable.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.382
They won't even let me
drop out of school.

14:09.482 --> 14:10.817
And even after I told them
that Bill Gates

14:10.918 --> 14:12.419
and Steve Jobs both
dropped out of college.

14:12.519 --> 14:13.853
What did they say?

14:13.954 --> 14:15.455
They said, "We don't care
what your friends do,

14:15.555 --> 14:17.324
you're not dropping out."
Well, Sheldon,

14:17.424 --> 14:18.525
I know it's disappointing,

14:18.625 --> 14:21.161
but, uh, I think they just have

14:21.261 --> 14:22.862
your best interests at heart.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.397
They said that, too.

14:24.497 --> 14:27.000
And for every
Bill Gates and Steve Jobs,

14:27.100 --> 14:28.801
there's a Paul Labiscous.

14:28.902 --> 14:29.869
Who's that?

14:29.970 --> 14:31.304
Exactly.

14:31.404 --> 14:34.274
But this is a good idea.
We can't just give up.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.676
Well, you could go back
to the university.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.211
They were willing to fund it.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.846
No, they wanted to control
the whole thing.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.982
I want somebody who will just
give me the money,

14:42.082 --> 14:43.516
let me work on my own schedule

14:43.616 --> 14:45.418
and not expect me to listen
to their dumb ideas.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.787
I don't think rich people
who give money

14:47.887 --> 14:50.457
like being told
their ideas are dumb.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.625
This is fun.
Not a lot of people

14:52.725 --> 14:54.627
I can talk to,
scientist to scientist.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.430
We're not talking
scientist to scientist.

14:57.530 --> 14:58.865
You're not
a scientist;

14:58.966 --> 15:00.200
you're just a rich man
that no one will be honest to

15:00.300 --> 15:02.069
because everyone
wants your money.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.503
What happened?

15:03.603 --> 15:04.871
He found my honesty delightful

15:04.972 --> 15:06.573
and gave the university
a lot of money.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.641
Impressive.
I know.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.744
But what are the odds
we'll find someone like him?

15:14.281 --> 15:15.915
Oh.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.050
(phone ringing)

15:17.150 --> 15:18.918
Hello?

15:19.019 --> 15:20.187
Hey, Missy, it's Dean.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.990
Oh, hi-- Hey, I mean... Hi.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.224
It was, uh,

15:24.324 --> 15:25.592
fun hanging out with you
the other night.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.727
I thought maybe
we could do it again.

15:27.827 --> 15:29.662
Totally.
We could go to the mall.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.264
Or we could go mini-golfing.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.699
I was thinking

15:32.799 --> 15:34.934
maybe we could hang out
with your grandma again.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.204
And do what?

15:37.304 --> 15:38.238
I don't know, uh,

15:38.338 --> 15:40.240
we could play a board game,

15:40.340 --> 15:41.608
or...

15:41.708 --> 15:44.077
Oh, my grandma loved
to bake cookies with me.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.945
I guess that could be fun.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.348
Great. It's a date.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.383
Right. You and me.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.619
At your meemaw's.
Can't wait. Bye.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.489
* *

15:56.589 --> 15:58.191
(indistinct chatter)
All right!

15:58.291 --> 16:00.860
Hands in, "team" on three.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.829
Wait. Isn't Pastor Rob gonna
pray with us?

16:02.929 --> 16:05.132
Well, he's late
and we got a game to play.

16:05.232 --> 16:07.000
Actually, we have a few minutes.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.835
Thanks, Wayne.

16:08.935 --> 16:11.438
Y'all want a prayer,
I'll give you a prayer.

16:11.538 --> 16:13.273
Circle up.

16:13.373 --> 16:14.807
Heavenly Father,

16:14.907 --> 16:16.976
bless this team
and the hands that catch...

16:17.077 --> 16:19.012
the-the ball...
Oh, boy.

16:19.112 --> 16:21.414
...the feet that run and...

16:21.514 --> 16:22.649
and kick...

16:22.749 --> 16:24.651
ROB: Hey, y'all!
Sorry, guys.

16:24.751 --> 16:25.952
Sorry I'm late, Coach.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.854
Oh, Pastor Rob's here,
you can stop.

16:27.954 --> 16:28.988
ROB:
No, no, George,

16:29.089 --> 16:31.058
I'm-I'm sure you're doing great.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.193
Come on, Pastor Rob,
we want you to do it.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.394
(team agreeing)

16:34.494 --> 16:36.329
It's fine, go ahead.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.864
All right.
Oh.

16:38.965 --> 16:40.133
(exhales)

16:40.233 --> 16:42.269
Heavenly Father,
bless this team--

16:42.369 --> 16:44.104
Exactly what I said.
Shh.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.438
ROB:
Help these young men...

16:47.907 --> 16:50.943
Thank you so much for bringing
this opportunity to me.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.145
This is exciting.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.513
So will you give us the funding?

16:53.613 --> 16:54.881
Well, it's
a lot of money,

16:54.981 --> 16:57.917
but my horoscope did say
take a chance today.

16:58.718 --> 17:01.321
You're, uh, making
a big financial decision

17:01.421 --> 17:02.822
based on astrology?

17:02.922 --> 17:05.325
I know,
I'm such a Gemini, right?

17:05.425 --> 17:07.294
That's ridiculous.

17:07.394 --> 17:08.761
The alignment of
the planets and stars

17:08.861 --> 17:10.897
has no correlation
to your success or failure.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.332
Ah, this is great.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.967
I mean, science thrives
on this kind of debate.

17:15.068 --> 17:16.103
This isn't a debate.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.937
Rebuttal: Yes, it is.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.038
There we go again.

17:19.139 --> 17:20.307
(chuckles)

17:20.407 --> 17:21.974
Oh, I gotta tell ya,

17:22.075 --> 17:24.311
making lab furniture
has made me rich,

17:24.411 --> 17:27.647
but this,
this is what I really love.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.449
Now, just to be clear,

17:29.549 --> 17:32.452
we're looking for a financier,
not a partner.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.687
Oh, yes, no, this is your baby.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.923
You guys are the parents,
I'm just a wet nurse.

17:37.023 --> 17:39.992
Just a wealthy,
wealthy wet nurse.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.561
What does that mean?

17:41.661 --> 17:43.796
A wet nurse is a woman
who suckles another--
No, no,

17:43.896 --> 17:46.199
I know what it means,
I just meant what does he mean?

17:46.299 --> 17:49.369
Well, I mean I just want
to be around the process.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.138
Anything you need, I'm your guy.

17:51.238 --> 17:52.739
But I'm still in charge, right?

17:52.839 --> 17:54.741
Did NASA fake the moon landing?

17:54.841 --> 17:56.209
No.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.010
See, that's what I thought
until about a year ago.

17:58.111 --> 17:59.946
Oh, we're gonna have
so much fun.

18:00.046 --> 18:01.481
(chuckles)

18:01.581 --> 18:03.450
(cheering, band playing)

18:03.550 --> 18:05.952
(indistinct announcement)

18:06.052 --> 18:07.954
(cheering)

18:08.054 --> 18:10.157
QUARTERBACK:
Close to 23. Hut, hut!

18:10.257 --> 18:12.559
(grunting)

18:12.659 --> 18:13.793
(blows whistle)

18:13.893 --> 18:14.827
Ah, damn!

18:14.927 --> 18:15.962
Time!
(blows whistle)

18:16.062 --> 18:17.764
What do you want
to do, Coach?

18:17.864 --> 18:21.301
Send in the field goal unit,
we gotta go for a tie.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.403
Ooh...

18:23.503 --> 18:24.404
What?

18:24.504 --> 18:25.972
Nothing.

18:26.072 --> 18:27.207
Not my place.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.276
You got something to say,
let's hear it.

18:29.376 --> 18:30.510
I just don't think

18:30.610 --> 18:31.944
they're gonna expect you
to go for it.

18:32.044 --> 18:33.946
You fake a field goal,
you might catch 'em off guard.

18:34.046 --> 18:36.916
Actually, Pastor
Rob, at this level

18:37.016 --> 18:38.918
that kind of play never--
Hang on, Wayne.

18:39.018 --> 18:39.786
Rob got us a win

18:39.886 --> 18:41.521
last week all on his own.

18:41.621 --> 18:42.989
Who are we to say no?

18:44.657 --> 18:46.025
Are you sure?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.093
Yeah, I'm sure.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.161
What's the worst
that could happen?

18:48.261 --> 18:49.696
We could lose.
Yep.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.064
And who would we blame?

18:53.032 --> 18:55.568
Change of plans,
we're running the fake.

18:55.668 --> 18:56.736
Really?
Yeah, you heard me.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.305
Come on, let's go.

18:58.405 --> 18:59.539
(cheering)

18:59.639 --> 19:01.308
(whistle blows)
All right! Let's go!

19:01.408 --> 19:03.476
PASTOR ROB:
Let's go, guys!

19:03.576 --> 19:04.844
* *

19:04.944 --> 19:06.579
I don't want to tell you
how to do your job,

19:06.679 --> 19:08.881
but if I was a prayin'
man, I'd start now.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.551
(crowd cheering)

19:11.651 --> 19:13.586
All right, let's go.

19:13.686 --> 19:16.256
(indistinct chatter)

19:17.123 --> 19:18.758
Hut, hut!

19:23.863 --> 19:25.064
(cheering)
ANNOUNCER: Touchdown!

19:25.164 --> 19:27.200
(cheering wildly)

19:32.339 --> 19:33.506
(whooping)

19:33.606 --> 19:35.007
George, you crazy
son-of-a-bitch,

19:35.107 --> 19:36.909
I can't believe you
pulled that off!

19:37.009 --> 19:38.177
Me, neither.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.479
Looks like we make
a pretty good team, George.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.180
Yeah!

19:41.281 --> 19:43.216
What's up, boys? Go, go, go!

19:47.487 --> 19:49.188
Yeah!
Yeah!

19:49.289 --> 19:50.657
(laughter, cheering)

19:57.364 --> 19:58.931
Hey, Dean, want to help
me roll out the dough?

19:59.031 --> 20:01.200
Yeah, one second, I'm just
helping Grandma grease the pan.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.536
Who?

20:03.636 --> 20:05.238
Oh, uh, sorry.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.206
You just remind me
of my grandma.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.577
I tell you what,
why don't you help Missy,

20:10.677 --> 20:12.479
and I'm gonna
start the dishes.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.347
Oh, uh, while the
cookies are baking,

20:14.447 --> 20:16.215
maybe you could teach me
how to play gin rummy.

20:16.316 --> 20:18.518
All right, we're done here.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.820
What?
You heard me.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.422
Are you breaking
up with me?

20:22.522 --> 20:24.357
Yeah. You can go now.

20:24.457 --> 20:27.360
But my mom's not
picking me up till 7:00.

20:28.528 --> 20:31.130
Oh, I'll get the cards.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.632
