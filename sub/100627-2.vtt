00:18.541 --> 00:20.875
<i>There are always happier days to remember.</i>

00:21.750 --> 00:26.500
<i>The more fucked you are,</i>
<i>the happier those days seem to be.</i>

00:27.083 --> 00:28.625
<i>While hoping for a miracle</i>

00:28.708 --> 00:31.208
<i>and hearing the beep</i>
<i>of Nairobi's vital signs,</i>

00:31.291 --> 00:35.541
<i>I remembered those days,</i>
<i>like the soccer match at the monastery.</i>

00:36.125 --> 00:38.416
-Keep up the defense. One minute left.
-Come on.

00:38.500 --> 00:40.416
-Hey!
-Come on.

00:40.500 --> 00:41.458
Go.

00:42.166 --> 00:43.000
Take this.

00:43.083 --> 00:47.500
<i>I never imagined the seconds before</i>
<i>a corner kick could be so much fun.</i>

00:48.250 --> 00:49.166
Hey!

00:49.250 --> 00:50.833
Ref, he touched my balls!

00:50.916 --> 00:52.000
You saw that.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Please! Enough. There's a minute left.
Are you going to waste it arguing?

00:57.083 --> 00:59.083
I was defending. He was glued to my ass!

00:59.166 --> 01:01.375
I saw you touching his balls, pig.

01:01.458 --> 01:04.833
That's enough!
Don't touch him again... anywhere, OK?

01:04.916 --> 01:06.833
-Or you'll be sent off.
-OK, go.

01:06.916 --> 01:07.750
Come on, go!

01:09.708 --> 01:10.833
It's a goal!

01:12.291 --> 01:13.250
Penalty!

01:13.333 --> 01:16.250
-Let's see what happens.
-There's gonna be a fight.

01:18.458 --> 01:19.375
There we go!

01:19.458 --> 01:21.916
Penalty and a red card. Get out of here!

01:25.583 --> 01:27.041
-Tokyo!
-Go.

01:29.750 --> 01:32.750
<i>-There's no signal. Everything's down.</i>
<i>-What do we do?</i>

01:32.833 --> 01:35.375
<i>-We're losing her.</i>
<i>-No, fuck!</i>

01:59.375 --> 02:00.416
Carefully.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.208
Slowly.

02:03.500 --> 02:04.833
OK, I have it.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.250
A little bit higher.

02:08.375 --> 02:09.916
You're doing really well.

02:10.583 --> 02:12.250
Now remove the bullet.

02:14.791 --> 02:15.708
Go on.

02:18.500 --> 02:19.416
That's it.

02:20.291 --> 02:21.250
Good.

02:21.333 --> 02:22.958
Be careful. That's it.

02:23.708 --> 02:24.875
There it is.

02:50.916 --> 02:52.125
<i>That is nostalgia:</i>

02:52.875 --> 02:57.416
<i>finding out that past events</i>
<i>you hadn't even imagined were happiness</i>

02:58.083 --> 02:58.916
<i>actually were.</i>

03:09.041 --> 03:10.375
Yeah!

03:15.791 --> 03:18.750
<i>We hadn't even</i>
<i>reached the end of the first half,</i>

03:18.833 --> 03:23.208
<i>and Lisbon was 3 kilometers from the tent</i>
<i>and forced to switch jerseys.</i>

03:23.666 --> 03:25.416
<i>Goal by Sierra into the top corner.</i>

03:28.375 --> 03:30.416
<i>Meanwhile, like robots,</i>

03:30.750 --> 03:33.291
<i>we removed a piece of Nairobi's lung.</i>

03:34.250 --> 03:36.666
<i>We didn't know</i>
<i>if we were saving her life</i>

03:36.750 --> 03:38.208
<i>or finishing her off.</i>

03:38.791 --> 03:40.250
<i>A second teammate down.</i>

03:41.208 --> 03:42.916
<i>And a second goal against us.</i>

03:45.208 --> 03:47.958
<i>And the third was yet to come,</i>
<i>from Palermo.</i>

03:48.416 --> 03:50.000
<i>But it'd be on our side.</i>

03:57.458 --> 03:59.083
<i>He had been a good captain.</i>

04:01.375 --> 04:03.375
<i>But he was an awful team player.</i>

04:26.500 --> 04:30.458
<i>The only thing resembling the plan</i>
<i>was the Professor's arrival in Madrid.</i>

04:30.625 --> 04:34.500
<i>But not even that was right.</i>
<i>A rider was missing.</i>

04:35.833 --> 04:36.750
Professor...

04:37.458 --> 04:38.375
we have to go.

04:51.666 --> 04:55.708
<i>By motorbike and along forest trails,</i>
<i>dirt roads, and cattle routes,</i>

04:55.791 --> 04:58.333
<i>they crossed La Mancha,</i>
<i>avoiding checkpoints.</i>

04:58.416 --> 04:59.875
<i>The knight and his squire,</i>

04:59.958 --> 05:04.583
<i>defeat after defeat, advancing towards</i>
<i>a battle of fools in this unwinnable war.</i>

05:05.166 --> 05:07.958
<i>Meanwhile, everything</i>
<i>was about to explode.</i>

06:32.000 --> 06:33.333
Can you believe this?

06:35.791 --> 06:37.166
Me, pregnant.

06:38.958 --> 06:40.500
Who would have thought?

06:41.458 --> 06:42.583
Congratulations.

06:43.875 --> 06:44.791
Thank you.

07:51.791 --> 07:52.750
Seriously...

07:54.416 --> 07:56.083
you're very brave, you know?

07:56.583 --> 07:57.875
I did what I had to.

07:57.958 --> 08:00.958
Unless we make a stand,
they'll trample us like in Auschwitz.

08:01.375 --> 08:03.041
If it stings too much, tell me.

08:03.125 --> 08:06.833
Go ahead, put alcohol on it.
I can handle pain. I'm used to it.

08:08.208 --> 08:09.041
Let's see...

08:13.416 --> 08:14.250
Keep going.

08:39.833 --> 08:44.500
Have you lost your mind?
You beat the crap out of him.

08:44.666 --> 08:48.291
-You can't lose it like that!
-How can I not? This is a pressure cooker.

08:48.375 --> 08:49.291
Exactly!

08:49.625 --> 08:53.541
That's why you can't come to blows
with people, like a spoiled brat!

08:58.958 --> 09:00.791
You have blood... Your top's...

09:01.541 --> 09:04.500
Don't worry about me.
I can't see with this eye.

09:12.916 --> 09:14.166
Listen, Amanda...

09:14.833 --> 09:18.125
have you had any anxiety attacks
because of the heist?

09:20.416 --> 09:23.208
-Well... I think so.
-I see.

09:24.875 --> 09:28.583
And I can't sleep
for more than 30 minutes straight.

09:28.666 --> 09:31.416
Because I have a knot right here, and I...

09:33.916 --> 09:36.083
That's normal in these cases.

09:36.416 --> 09:38.250
There's a lot of tension.

09:38.916 --> 09:42.791
A lot of tension. But don't worry,
I'll get you some sedatives.

09:43.208 --> 09:49.500
We don't want you getting PTSD,
because it's so hard to get over.

09:49.583 --> 09:51.166
In fact, sometimes...

09:51.708 --> 09:53.083
it lasts forever.

09:55.625 --> 09:58.208
Let me help you. You have some blood here.

10:00.041 --> 10:05.000
Don't worry, while I'm around...
you'll have everything you need.

10:08.666 --> 10:10.541
You'll be my personal project.

10:13.708 --> 10:18.083
We're holding up the Bank of Spain.
Maybe you've forgotten, but I haven't.

10:18.166 --> 10:21.250
-We never acted like dicks before.
-Maybe I'm traumatized.

10:21.333 --> 10:24.125
Maybe that's what's up.
We're all traumatized.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.666
What the fuck do you mean?
What's my trauma?

10:28.333 --> 10:29.500
-I'm not--
-Tell me.

10:29.583 --> 10:30.791
You broke up with Tokyo.

10:31.333 --> 10:34.166
How many guys do you know
who would leave Tokyo?

10:34.541 --> 10:36.833
None, because you don't leave Tokyo.

10:39.333 --> 10:41.083
What do you know about Tokyo?

10:41.166 --> 10:44.083
Tokyo is a fucking Maserati.
Everyone wants one.

10:44.166 --> 10:45.958
If you leave one in the street

10:46.041 --> 10:49.625
with the doors open and keys in it,
you've gotta be fucked up.

10:51.958 --> 10:54.625
Look, Rio. I'm gonna make this very clear:

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
maybe your trauma comes
from them affecting your manhood.

10:59.958 --> 11:03.125
Maybe they pushed you too far...
with the torture.

11:04.416 --> 11:08.041
You need to let it out.
That's why you left Tokyo, isn't it?

11:08.500 --> 11:12.333
If one person did it or if it was a group,
the trauma it causes is different.

11:12.416 --> 11:13.416
Let it out!

11:15.750 --> 11:19.583
You can count on me...
for whatever you need.

11:21.250 --> 11:22.208
Anything.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.583
Ladies and gentlemen...

11:41.125 --> 11:43.833
I regret to inform you
that I must say goodbye.

11:44.125 --> 11:45.041
I'm leaving.

11:45.666 --> 11:49.916
-Keep up the good spirits.
-What the fuck are you doing?

11:51.333 --> 11:52.208
Matías...

11:53.541 --> 11:54.500
I'm leaving.

11:56.916 --> 11:59.708
Pleasure working with you, as always.

12:01.375 --> 12:02.625
I would even say...

12:04.125 --> 12:05.916
that I love you a lot, Matías.

12:06.666 --> 12:08.291
As for all of you...

12:08.750 --> 12:11.291
I hope my leadership
hasn't been too traumatic.

12:11.375 --> 12:15.583
You can tell your grandchildren
and loved ones this story. Anyway...

12:16.041 --> 12:17.666
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:18.083 --> 12:19.416
it's been a pleasure.

12:25.416 --> 12:26.791
What the...?

12:32.875 --> 12:34.041
Calm down.

12:35.541 --> 12:37.625
Palermo, calm down.

12:38.583 --> 12:41.625
Let's talk... calmly.

12:43.833 --> 12:45.333
But you're not leaving.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.666
Fucking hell!

12:53.291 --> 12:56.875
You staged a coup d'état, you bitch!
What did you expect?

12:56.958 --> 13:00.458
I'm in charge of the military side,
you're in charge of the technical.

13:00.541 --> 13:01.708
The technical side?

13:03.083 --> 13:06.375
Do I look like
some nerdy engineer with glasses?

13:08.208 --> 13:10.916
What sort of orders would I give?

13:11.708 --> 13:13.500
Now melt, now don't!

13:13.583 --> 13:17.041
Bathyscaphe out! Bathyscaphe in!
Immersion! Emersion!

13:18.666 --> 13:20.708
Who the fuck do you think I am?

13:21.250 --> 13:25.333
I didn't come here for this shit!
This is beneath me. I'm off.

13:28.208 --> 13:32.458
I'm activating the manual door,
and I'm doing you a favor.

13:34.250 --> 13:36.875
Because if I stay,
I'll shoot the shit out of you

13:36.958 --> 13:38.416
and the rest of them.

13:40.625 --> 13:42.375
I'm not on your side anymore.

13:51.125 --> 13:56.500
It's me who's doing you a favor.
Because I swear, the next thing I'll do...

13:57.500 --> 13:58.958
is kill you.

13:59.583 --> 14:00.583
I don't think so.

14:01.791 --> 14:02.833
I think so.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.708
Claymore mines...

14:14.958 --> 14:16.458
which, as you can see...

14:17.416 --> 14:19.208
are pointing towards you.

14:19.583 --> 14:21.125
They won't get me.

14:22.625 --> 14:25.458
You know I have no qualms
about killing you.

14:26.291 --> 14:27.375
Easy.

14:27.458 --> 14:29.416
You can't betray us like this.

14:30.208 --> 14:31.333
Do you want to bet?

14:33.666 --> 14:36.541
Palermo! Don't move!

14:37.625 --> 14:38.500
Oh, good.

14:38.583 --> 14:42.583
The mad princess came
to wave her prince goodbye at the station.

14:42.666 --> 14:44.500
Have some dignity!

14:44.958 --> 14:48.166
Where are you going? To prison?

14:49.916 --> 14:51.583
To be shot in the forehead?

14:52.250 --> 14:53.583
To sell us out?

14:53.666 --> 14:55.208
I won't sell anyone out.

14:55.291 --> 14:57.583
I have a safeguard: state secrets.

14:57.666 --> 14:59.291
I won't betray you.

14:59.375 --> 15:00.791
Leaving is betrayal.

15:01.291 --> 15:03.291
Leaving us alone here is betrayal.

15:04.125 --> 15:05.208
Don't...

15:05.291 --> 15:07.708
move, I don't want to kill you, big man.

15:08.916 --> 15:10.458
You don't want to kill me?

15:16.250 --> 15:17.750
You'll have to kill me.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.875
What you're doing is crazy, Helsinki.

15:22.833 --> 15:24.416
If you leave, Palermo...

15:25.791 --> 15:26.791
I swear...

15:27.833 --> 15:29.750
I'll go boom...

15:29.833 --> 15:32.166
boom... ciao.

15:34.708 --> 15:38.333
I'm serious, Palermo. I will.

15:45.208 --> 15:46.208
Seriously.

15:50.375 --> 15:51.666
I got you.

16:12.916 --> 16:14.916
What the hell did you say to Rio?

16:15.000 --> 16:17.541
-About what?
-You told him he's traumatized.

16:17.958 --> 16:20.416
Call it what you like,
but something's up.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.750
Something's up?
Because he left Tokyo?

16:22.833 --> 16:25.375
-Because she's a... Maserati.
-Look...

16:26.458 --> 16:28.833
The Maserati thing is the way guys talk.

16:28.916 --> 16:32.416
What I'm saying is
something happened during the torture.

16:33.166 --> 16:36.041
-They pushed him too far.
-They did what?

16:36.125 --> 16:38.666
Forty sweaty guys opened his back door.

16:38.958 --> 16:40.458
In his back door.

16:40.541 --> 16:44.458
Rio was tortured,
and you go and give him all that shit.

16:44.541 --> 16:47.250
It's true.
I asked if they crossed the line.

16:47.333 --> 16:51.375
Know what? He went quiet
because he can't face it. A textbook case.

16:51.458 --> 16:52.291
No.

16:54.083 --> 16:55.000
I can't.

16:56.291 --> 16:57.291
You can't what?

16:58.625 --> 17:00.916
You know? All of a sudden I feel...

17:02.083 --> 17:04.750
-as if the bubble has burst.
-What bubble?

17:04.916 --> 17:05.833
What bubble?

17:07.041 --> 17:10.125
No, I want to know
what bubble we're talking about.

17:10.416 --> 17:11.333
What bubble?

17:14.291 --> 17:17.166
It's as if a blindfold
has fallen from my eyes.

17:18.125 --> 17:20.125
I don't recognize you.

17:21.041 --> 17:25.250
I don't know what we're doing together.
I don't know who you are.

17:25.666 --> 17:27.833
Mónica... don't get me wrong.

17:27.958 --> 17:31.166
Tokyo may be a Maserati,
but it doesn't mean you're a 600.

17:36.458 --> 17:37.625
I'm sorry, Denver.

17:38.458 --> 17:39.833
I can't stay with you.

17:56.500 --> 17:57.458
Right.

17:59.375 --> 18:03.416
When you see her coming at you,
angry like a hydra, shut up.

18:05.083 --> 18:09.083
A hydra... A... Never mind.
Just keep your fucking mouth shut.

18:09.166 --> 18:11.166
-And not defend myself?
-No.

18:11.250 --> 18:14.041
Because you don't even know
why she's angry.

18:14.250 --> 18:15.791
You, hush.

18:15.875 --> 18:18.125
The less you know
what she's talking about,

18:18.208 --> 18:19.250
the sorrier you are.

18:19.708 --> 18:23.500
You say, "Yes, sorry, darling"
to everything.

18:23.583 --> 18:25.375
Now, that is a textbook case.

18:25.458 --> 18:28.958
-From a textbook for the henpecked.
-No, for survivors.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.875
You wait for the storm to pass.

18:30.958 --> 18:33.875
When you work out
which way the wind is blowing,

18:33.958 --> 18:36.583
and when she has calmed down,

18:37.083 --> 18:39.833
then, and only then...

18:41.500 --> 18:42.666
you make your move.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.541
Didn't you see me before?

18:46.958 --> 18:50.625
We've had problems since the monastery.
That's what's going on.

18:50.708 --> 18:53.416
-Well...
-This has been building up.

18:54.250 --> 18:57.041
And with all this pressure,
it all comes out.

18:58.708 --> 18:59.958
That's what's up.

19:17.791 --> 19:18.625
<i>Professor.</i>

19:20.500 --> 19:21.375
<i>It's Tokyo.</i>

19:26.000 --> 19:29.416
-You just staged a coup d'état.
-<i>Palermo's gone crazy.</i>

19:29.500 --> 19:32.000
He almost blew up the lobby.

19:32.083 --> 19:34.916
-<i>But we've got it under control.</i>
-You don't.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.500
You can't control him. He's unpredictable.

19:37.583 --> 19:39.666
He's tied up and under surveillance 24/7.

19:39.750 --> 19:42.083
Tokyo, the plan is falling to pieces!

19:43.416 --> 19:45.416
I'm still here, Professor.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.125
So what?

19:47.208 --> 19:49.833
<i>Without Palermo,</i>
<i>we can't get the gold out.</i>

19:49.916 --> 19:51.541
<i>Do you know how to do it?</i>

19:52.000 --> 19:53.208
And without Nairobi!

19:53.958 --> 19:55.125
And without Lisbon!

20:13.250 --> 20:17.041
<i>Palermo was leaving</i>
<i>because it's the only smart thing to do.</i>

20:18.375 --> 20:19.208
Professor...

20:20.041 --> 20:22.041
<i>you've been my guardian angel.</i>

20:23.500 --> 20:24.583
Now it's my turn.

20:28.916 --> 20:30.041
How did it happen?

20:31.916 --> 20:33.625
She died to protect me.

20:34.083 --> 20:35.666
I'm really sorry.

20:36.291 --> 20:37.208
<i>I...</i>

20:38.083 --> 20:41.125
was camouflaged
in a tree, and there were...

20:42.791 --> 20:45.250
soldiers and police officers everywhere.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.916
<i>She was on a farm.</i>
<i>That's where they found her.</i>

20:50.750 --> 20:54.625
<i>They made her kneel down, unarmed,</i>
<i>and they asked her about me.</i>

20:55.208 --> 20:57.291
<i>I ran and ran.</i>

20:57.375 --> 20:59.583
They asked her, "Where's the Professor?"

21:02.000 --> 21:03.666
I said, "Tell them, Raquel.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.583
Tell them where I am,
tell them I'll surrender, please."

21:10.083 --> 21:11.333
<i>"I don't know."</i>

21:12.375 --> 21:14.291
<i>She repeated, "I don't know."</i>

21:16.625 --> 21:18.208
<i>And they shot her twice.</i>

21:20.875 --> 21:23.250
She was unarmed,
and they shot her twice.

21:27.125 --> 21:28.875
I didn't make it in time.

21:40.916 --> 21:41.875
<i>Did you see it?</i>

21:43.625 --> 21:44.833
You only heard it?

21:46.333 --> 21:49.791
Professor,
did you see them moving her body?

21:49.875 --> 21:51.208
I had to run.

21:52.125 --> 21:53.041
<i>Listen to me.</i>

21:53.750 --> 21:56.375
I also heard
my mother tell me to come home,

21:56.666 --> 21:58.333
<i>that I'd be safer there.</i>

21:58.458 --> 22:01.000
<i>But 20 cops</i>
<i>were waiting in her kitchen.</i>

22:01.666 --> 22:06.541
And in the tent,
they also heard us fleeing from the bank,

22:07.708 --> 22:08.958
<i>but we're still here.</i>

22:09.458 --> 22:12.166
<i>The only one who left</i>
<i>was a ferret with a hood.</i>

22:15.208 --> 22:16.791
<i>Is there anything in the news?</i>

22:17.375 --> 22:18.250
Nothing.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.041
The same as with Rio.

22:26.458 --> 22:28.375
If they'd killed her, we'd know.

22:33.125 --> 22:34.541
She's being interrogated.

22:37.416 --> 22:40.000
-Where are you going?
-The Bank of Spain.

22:40.083 --> 22:42.666
It's not a good idea. It's too risky.

22:43.500 --> 22:45.250
I appreciate your concern,

22:45.333 --> 22:48.791
but it's the only place I can find out
if my partner's alive. Move.

22:48.875 --> 22:50.375
-No.
-I'm asking you.

22:50.458 --> 22:52.250
-No, Professor.
-Move.

22:52.333 --> 22:54.791
I won't let you get on the motorbike.

23:05.541 --> 23:06.458
Seventy.

23:09.875 --> 23:14.041
With what we have in those reports,
you'll be 70 when you're released.

23:15.333 --> 23:16.375
Paula will be 40.

23:17.166 --> 23:21.083
And your mother will be so long dead,
she'll be bones in a grave.

23:21.166 --> 23:23.125
Stop, you don't need to go on.

23:24.166 --> 23:26.875
The recommended sentence
depends on the prosecutor, not you.

23:27.291 --> 23:29.291
And the final decision, on the judge.

23:31.500 --> 23:32.875
But you know full well

23:33.500 --> 23:35.750
that the prosecutor and the judge

23:35.916 --> 23:39.875
work with what I write in these reports.

23:41.458 --> 23:43.458
And I can write whatever I want.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.708
What do you want me to write?

23:48.208 --> 23:50.791
You're going to make me
resort to violence.

23:50.875 --> 23:53.416
-I'm protecting the plan.
-It's my plan.

23:53.500 --> 23:56.125
This isn't the plan. It's improvisation.

23:56.208 --> 23:59.208
You always say, "No improvising."

23:59.291 --> 24:01.041
I won't give in.

24:01.833 --> 24:03.291
You need to understand

24:03.375 --> 24:06.166
that that's the only place
I can get answers.

24:06.250 --> 24:07.416
In the Bank of--

24:10.750 --> 24:12.125
Very well.

24:13.208 --> 24:14.625
Seriously, Professor?

24:16.375 --> 24:19.708
I don't know where the Professor is,
or what he'll do.

24:21.250 --> 24:22.333
Can't you think?

24:23.541 --> 24:25.458
Has love clouded your mind?

24:26.333 --> 24:28.750
The plan includes this kind of firewall.

24:29.750 --> 24:31.750
It's nothing to do with love.

24:31.833 --> 24:33.166
Of course it is.

24:33.250 --> 24:37.333
But just think,
in prison, love drains away like water.

24:37.416 --> 24:40.750
<i>It disappears fast.</i>
<i>In two months, it's all dried up.</i>

24:40.833 --> 24:43.375
<i>Two months of suffering</i>
<i>or a life in prison?</i>

24:45.875 --> 24:48.250
Even if you were reincarnated seven times,

24:48.916 --> 24:51.333
you still wouldn't understand
our love.

24:51.416 --> 24:52.791
To protect the plan,

24:52.875 --> 24:55.500
we need to see
if she's being interrogated there.

24:55.583 --> 24:58.041
If so, it'll be Alicia Sierra doing it,

24:58.125 --> 25:01.000
and she'll be at the Bank of Spain.

25:01.958 --> 25:03.208
But you can't go!

25:03.750 --> 25:07.291
Let me tell you
about the nature of your love.

25:07.625 --> 25:09.916
One in jail in Soto del Real,
the other in Cádiz,

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
waiting for a yearly conjugal visit.

25:12.083 --> 25:15.708
That's if you're lucky.
Because if we don't catch your lover,

25:15.791 --> 25:18.416
<i>you won't ever fucking see him again.</i>

25:18.750 --> 25:23.333
Choose between that or getting out in time
to be a mother to your daughter.

25:23.416 --> 25:26.250
You're trying
to emotionally manipulate me.

25:26.333 --> 25:28.000
I'm just speaking the truth.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.083
As always.

25:31.625 --> 25:33.416
To protect the plan, we must go.

25:33.500 --> 25:37.375
How will you go to the tent
if your face is all over the news?

25:39.083 --> 25:40.416
Like everyone else.

25:41.916 --> 25:43.666
In a red jumpsuit and a Dalí mask.

25:44.333 --> 25:46.000
Oh, good.

25:47.875 --> 25:49.541
She won't betray us.

25:49.625 --> 25:50.750
Give me your hand.

25:54.708 --> 25:55.791
Give me your hand.

25:59.166 --> 26:02.291
How many times have you thought
you'd fallen in love before?

26:06.666 --> 26:10.291
The same will happen this time,
and you know it.

26:17.291 --> 26:20.208
Everyone is capable of betrayal,
Marseille.

26:20.291 --> 26:21.708
You only have to know--

26:24.916 --> 26:27.791
That was quite a punch--
I thought we were finished.

26:28.333 --> 26:29.166
Were we?

26:30.125 --> 26:31.000
I didn't know.

27:15.875 --> 27:18.625
-Have some more to drink.
-I've had two.

27:18.708 --> 27:19.958
You look so serious.

27:21.208 --> 27:23.208
This is a weird wedding, Andrés.

27:23.291 --> 27:24.541
It's a great party!

27:24.625 --> 27:26.875
-Brother!
-I feel bad for her. She's young,

27:26.958 --> 27:29.833
and she's in love, but you're sick.

27:29.916 --> 27:33.833
Didn't you hear the priest?
"Till death do you part."

27:35.791 --> 27:38.250
Maybe for you it's the grand finale,

27:38.333 --> 27:41.541
but for her, it's the beginning,
and it isn't a fair one.

27:42.541 --> 27:44.375
She knows I'm sick.

27:44.458 --> 27:46.458
Everyone knows I'm sick.

27:46.541 --> 27:48.791
You're betraying her feelings.

27:50.583 --> 27:54.125
I'll give her
the best two or three years of her life.

27:54.250 --> 27:58.166
Yes, and after that...
Actually, I will betray her in a way.

27:59.791 --> 28:00.833
Anyway.

28:00.916 --> 28:03.291
Betrayal is an inherent part of love.

28:03.666 --> 28:06.041
Since we're on the subject, have a look.

28:06.125 --> 28:07.000
Martín.

28:08.375 --> 28:11.375
What a legend! My best friend. He's happy.

28:11.708 --> 28:13.083
Would he betray me?

28:15.208 --> 28:16.708
Of course he would,

28:16.791 --> 28:19.375
in the right circumstances. Tatiana?

28:21.333 --> 28:22.583
Tatiana would too.

28:22.666 --> 28:28.291
You say you experience love,
but you only see traitors everywhere.

28:28.375 --> 28:29.916
No, I'm not saying that.

28:30.750 --> 28:35.625
I'm saying, betrayal doesn't depend on
how or how much you love someone.

28:35.708 --> 28:39.625
It depends on
how difficult your dilemma is.

28:40.041 --> 28:42.708
Would you betray your beloved?
In theory, no.

28:42.791 --> 28:45.375
But what if you were told
that if you did,

28:45.458 --> 28:48.750
you'd be given a drug
to save your beloved brother?

28:50.916 --> 28:52.583
That is a real dilemma.

29:19.500 --> 29:21.625
<i>Sergio Marquina. Emotional coldness.</i>

29:22.666 --> 29:24.583
<i>Compulsive narcissism.</i>

29:24.958 --> 29:26.708
<i>Pathological shyness.</i>

29:27.125 --> 29:28.708
<i>Psychopathic traits...</i>

29:31.125 --> 29:32.708
-In short, a gem.
-Well.

29:33.666 --> 29:37.083
A report written by a mock expert
without interviewing the subject.

29:37.833 --> 29:41.125
He's much more fun
than what it says there.

29:42.291 --> 29:43.125
Cool.

29:44.416 --> 29:46.958
Yeah, a psychopath can be so much fun.

29:48.125 --> 29:49.458
Then there's your profile.

29:50.916 --> 29:52.208
What about it?

29:52.291 --> 29:55.708
You're the caring type that gets attached
to this sort of jerk.

29:57.250 --> 29:58.375
You idealize them.

29:59.333 --> 30:04.375
Gradually, you get smaller by their side.
Then, they use and manipulate you.

30:05.500 --> 30:08.583
When did you give up on
your gut instinct, inspector?

30:09.666 --> 30:12.166
Before the Professor came into your life?

30:13.208 --> 30:18.000
Because Alberto used to beat you up.
How does this one humiliate you?

30:19.875 --> 30:23.750
First you use my mother's Alzheimer's
and now domestic violence.

30:23.833 --> 30:28.583
Tell me the story is not repeating itself.
Tell me at some point it hasn't clicked,

30:28.666 --> 30:32.208
and you've thought, "Careful,
this guy could be a bastard."

30:33.500 --> 30:34.625
Say it's not true.

30:35.750 --> 30:38.375
<i>You know about protocols and negotiation,</i>
<i>but so do I.</i>

30:38.791 --> 30:40.083
I beat you, Raquel.

30:40.500 --> 30:44.166
I must be a fool,
because I thought we had fallen in love.

30:44.250 --> 30:45.458
I didn't ask you to come.

30:45.541 --> 30:46.916
<i>It was a bluff.</i>

30:47.000 --> 30:49.375
She hung up,
and we didn't even play our hand!

30:49.458 --> 30:52.041
She went for you
because you're the weakest link.

30:54.166 --> 30:55.541
What's he done for you?

30:55.625 --> 30:58.208
Would he go to an island
with his family for you?

30:59.375 --> 31:01.375
Would he follow a plan of yours?

31:02.750 --> 31:06.791
Have you ever been the protagonist? Ever?

31:08.041 --> 31:10.666
Or have you always followed him
like a puppy?

31:11.208 --> 31:14.250
I warned you about Alberto.
He was a son of a bitch.

31:15.208 --> 31:16.666
And this guy's the same.

31:18.041 --> 31:20.166
The question is very simple, Raquel:

31:22.041 --> 31:24.541
do you deserve to spend 30 years in prison

31:25.125 --> 31:27.041
for an idiot in a mask?

31:33.416 --> 31:34.333
Colonel...

31:35.791 --> 31:39.250
I've been checking the reports,
and it may be my mistake,

31:39.333 --> 31:42.458
but I can't find
the records for Murillo's arrest.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.416
-You've been checking what?
-I don't want a technicality...

31:46.500 --> 31:49.708
Well, you know...
it's a question of human rights.

31:49.791 --> 31:52.875
What's wrong with you?
Did you join an NGO?

31:52.958 --> 31:55.250
Amnesty International? Cut the crap.

31:55.333 --> 31:57.041
But according to the law--

31:57.125 --> 32:00.291
Do you know
when we start applying the law in here?

32:01.250 --> 32:02.958
Can you guess?

32:03.500 --> 32:04.750
Give me an answer.

32:06.166 --> 32:08.166
-When you--
-...fucking say so.

32:08.250 --> 32:10.791
Specifically, whenever I fucking want to.

32:10.875 --> 32:14.666
I don't give a shit about arrest reports
or procedural guarantees.

32:16.458 --> 32:18.291
Do you understand?

32:19.666 --> 32:21.416
Yes, I do.

32:24.458 --> 32:25.916
So until then...

32:27.791 --> 32:32.916
Until then, that bitch will be sat there
with no sleep, peeing in a bucket.

32:33.666 --> 32:35.166
Got a problem with that?

32:35.375 --> 32:37.750
No... no problem.

32:37.833 --> 32:40.125
Good, Antoñanzas. Good.

32:44.583 --> 32:46.166
TRANSPARENCY

32:51.416 --> 32:53.041
GIVE ME A RAISE

32:56.333 --> 32:58.750
LONG LIVE EVIL
LONG LIVE CAPITAL

32:58.833 --> 33:01.916
<i>This system does not represent us!</i>

33:02.000 --> 33:06.833
<i>The Professor would've loved X-ray vision</i>
<i>to see if Lisbon was behind the canvas.</i>

33:07.000 --> 33:08.583
<i>But he wasn't Superman.</i>

33:08.666 --> 33:11.583
<i>So he had to make do</i>
<i>with being Sherlock Holmes.</i>

33:12.000 --> 33:15.375
<i>He arrived at the bank</i>
<i>in search of a thread to pull.</i>

33:15.458 --> 33:16.583
<i>And he found three.</i>

33:17.708 --> 33:19.958
<i>The van. What was it doing there?</i>

33:21.125 --> 33:22.916
<i>And why did it have mud on it?</i>

33:23.833 --> 33:26.166
CNP85600N.

33:26.250 --> 33:28.250
<i>Pakistan found the answer.</i>

33:28.333 --> 33:30.916
<i>The van belonged</i>
<i>to the police in Huelva,</i>

33:31.000 --> 33:33.875
<i>near where Lisbon</i>
<i>had supposedly been killed.</i>

33:37.291 --> 33:38.166
<i>Ángel.</i>

33:40.000 --> 33:44.208
<i>If anyone should have been following</i>
<i>the Hamelin plan trail, it was him.</i>

33:44.583 --> 33:47.166
<i>Unless he had</i>
<i>something more important to do.</i>

33:47.541 --> 33:49.541
<i>Like transferring Lisbon to Madrid.</i>

33:50.041 --> 33:54.125
<i>If anyone should have been mourning</i>
<i>a friend's death, it was also him.</i>

33:58.333 --> 34:01.750
<i>And Alicia Sierra.</i>
<i>The truce had been declared hours ago.</i>

34:01.833 --> 34:03.375
<i>But there she was.</i>

34:03.458 --> 34:05.416
<i>As much of a workaholic as she was,</i>

34:05.500 --> 34:08.833
<i>she should have been home</i>
<i>soaking her ankles.</i>

34:09.958 --> 34:12.041
<i>Unless she got off on interrogating</i>

34:12.125 --> 34:15.041
<i>one of the most-wanted criminals</i>
<i>in the country.</i>

34:16.708 --> 34:18.125
<i>Lisbon might be alive.</i>

34:18.708 --> 34:20.333
<i>But he needed to check</i>

34:20.416 --> 34:23.291
<i>and let her know he wouldn't abandon her.</i>

34:41.875 --> 34:44.875
The ambulance you used
as a communication center arrived.

34:48.625 --> 34:50.375
Know who'll inspect it?

34:55.750 --> 34:57.583
Alberto, your ex-husband.

34:59.041 --> 35:00.791
Besides being the best CSI,

35:00.875 --> 35:04.041
he's very eager
to fuck your life up even more.

35:05.333 --> 35:06.666
There's another option.

35:14.708 --> 35:20.208
I could go in there... before anyone else
and get rid of all the evidence.

35:28.791 --> 35:30.333
You won't find anything.

35:35.791 --> 35:36.958
Shit, Raquel.

35:38.333 --> 35:39.458
You should know.

35:41.583 --> 35:43.125
We always find something.

35:44.750 --> 35:48.208
We'll find a clue that leads us
to your mom and daughter.

35:48.958 --> 35:50.000
You'll see.

36:44.541 --> 36:48.208
Next five, get ready
to go to the bathroom with my colleague.

36:58.958 --> 37:02.750
Hey, Gandía, now we're on the same team,
may I ask a question?

37:02.833 --> 37:06.791
I'm confused.
Are we... the good guys or the bad guys?

37:09.666 --> 37:11.583
I'll cut your nutsack open,

37:11.666 --> 37:15.291
pull out your balls,
and shove them in your mouth.

37:15.666 --> 37:17.000
That'd be interesting.

37:17.708 --> 37:19.916
But your hands are tied up, buddy.

37:30.125 --> 37:35.000
Did you know the reliability of handcuffs
is based on one anatomical feature?

37:36.333 --> 37:38.583
The metacarpal stops them coming off.

37:39.791 --> 37:43.125
But it's very easy to dislocate it.

37:44.416 --> 37:46.458
-Really?
-Well...

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
they're ideas for freedom.

37:50.791 --> 37:52.333
<i>Free</i>

37:53.333 --> 37:55.791
<i>Like the sun at dawn</i>

37:55.875 --> 37:58.125
<i>I'm free</i>

37:58.458 --> 38:01.416
<i>Like the sea</i>

38:01.708 --> 38:03.666
<i>Free</i>

38:03.750 --> 38:07.541
<i>Like the bird that escaped from its prison</i>

38:08.000 --> 38:11.041
<i>And can finally fly</i>

38:11.250 --> 38:12.875
<i>Free</i>

38:12.958 --> 38:15.333
<i>Like the wind that gathers</i>

38:15.416 --> 38:19.375
<i>My lament and my regret</i>

38:19.458 --> 38:21.458
<i>I walk endlessly</i>

38:21.916 --> 38:25.833
<i>In search of the truth</i>
<i>And I'll finally know</i>

38:25.916 --> 38:29.625
<i>What freedom is</i>

38:33.583 --> 38:34.666
Go to sleep.

38:37.958 --> 38:39.666
Four corners to my bed,

38:40.875 --> 38:42.958
four angels round my head.

38:43.333 --> 38:45.625
Luke, Matthew, and Joseph,

38:46.125 --> 38:48.291
our Lord and the Virgin Mary.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.208
Antoñanzas.

39:10.041 --> 39:11.166
Why are you here?

39:12.625 --> 39:13.625
You're...

39:15.541 --> 39:16.833
You're under arrest!

39:21.541 --> 39:22.708
On your knees.

39:24.041 --> 39:25.833
I was only testing the waters.

39:27.625 --> 39:29.083
On your knees.

39:36.750 --> 39:39.250
Please, my wife and daughters are in bed.

39:40.333 --> 39:41.791
They'll be fine.

39:43.625 --> 39:47.333
You just have to follow instructions
and answer some questions.

39:48.208 --> 39:51.083
I won't speak to someone
who has a gun to my head.

39:53.125 --> 39:54.250
You will speak.

39:57.416 --> 39:59.708
We've got, one:

40:01.666 --> 40:02.666
the ambulance.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.250
Two:

40:10.208 --> 40:11.750
the dotty grandma.

40:12.458 --> 40:15.458
Where am I?

40:15.541 --> 40:16.708
I can't do it.

40:17.250 --> 40:20.666
Three: the motherless child.

40:21.125 --> 40:22.125
Mommy.

40:22.791 --> 40:24.958
Mommy.

40:26.125 --> 40:27.125
Four:

40:32.625 --> 40:34.958
the Professor's love,

40:36.333 --> 40:39.375
which will last two days
once you're in prison.

40:42.166 --> 40:44.833
And now, the final scene.

40:49.625 --> 40:53.916
You're assaulting an officer.
You don't know what you're getting into.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.083
We called a truce.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.833
A truce can be
the most important part of a war.

41:05.500 --> 41:06.500
I can't...

41:07.416 --> 41:08.541
I can't breathe.

41:12.833 --> 41:14.458
Pull yourself together.

41:15.666 --> 41:16.708
Calm down.

41:19.625 --> 41:20.541
I can't breathe.

41:23.375 --> 41:24.375
Marseille.

41:44.750 --> 41:45.625
Better?

42:05.166 --> 42:06.416
If you cooperate,

42:07.416 --> 42:10.625
the prosecution will request 12 years,
you'll get 10,

42:11.333 --> 42:12.875
and you'll be out in five.

42:13.750 --> 42:15.625
That's how your life could be.

42:16.791 --> 42:19.541
If you don't cooperate,
you'll get 30 years.

42:20.500 --> 42:22.250
That's how your life will be.

42:24.291 --> 42:26.583
Your choice, Inspector.
