WEBVTT

01:04.064 --> 01:06.024
KOREAN YOUTH DANCE COMPETITION

01:08.985 --> 01:12.572
ONE DAY AGO

02:07.460 --> 02:08.294
Li-sa.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.767
Was there anyone
Li-sa was close with while practicing?

02:22.851 --> 02:26.479
Anyone who might know where she went?

02:26.563 --> 02:29.941
Yes. There was a girl
who'd film all of her rehearsals.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.734
-Her name was--
-Lee Ju-yeong?

02:31.818 --> 02:33.194
Yes, I think so.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.864
Did she come here today?

02:36.573 --> 02:39.993
I think I saw her a while ago,
but I don't know where she went.

02:49.419 --> 02:50.753
I see. Thanks.

02:56.050 --> 02:57.010
Honey.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.312
I'll go look around more.

03:48.645 --> 03:52.732
<i>You draw someone because you love them.</i>

03:55.526 --> 03:57.570
And I think I saw him there.

04:14.671 --> 04:17.048
HYEON-SEONG

04:18.716 --> 04:21.386
<i>I got a hold of Ju-yeong.
They're together.</i>

04:21.469 --> 04:22.428
<i>Don't worry.</i>

04:23.763 --> 04:24.806
<i>Are you there?</i>

04:26.391 --> 04:28.768
<i>Hui-ju. Where are you right now?</i>

05:21.029 --> 05:22.322
Hey! Wait up!

05:22.989 --> 05:24.282
My goodness.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.705
Wait up! Walk slowly!

05:30.788 --> 05:32.290
Okay.

05:51.642 --> 05:54.187
<i>I thought I ran away best I could,</i>

05:55.063 --> 05:56.522
<i>but I'm back to square one.</i>

06:01.152 --> 06:06.157
EPISODE 8
US, HERE AGAIN

06:31.224 --> 06:33.434
-Are you hungry?
-Yes.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.603
I'll make some radish soup.
It won't take long.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.146
Where's Woo-jae?

06:38.147 --> 06:41.442
He said he was busy
and left early in the morning.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.404
Without even telling me?

06:45.488 --> 06:48.658
You were sound asleep,
so he didn't want to wake you.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.159
He wanted you to sleep in.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.705
Then I'll sleep a bit more.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.856
FAVORITES
WOO-JAE

07:19.939 --> 07:24.026
WOO-JAE

07:29.240 --> 07:32.118
<i>Ju-yeong, did you go to school?</i>

07:32.201 --> 07:34.620
<i>I have a favor to ask.</i>

07:40.293 --> 07:42.628
I told you
that place was private property.

07:42.712 --> 07:44.422
Why did you go up there again?

07:45.840 --> 07:47.091
To die?

07:47.842 --> 07:49.760
Maybe I shouldn't have grabbed you.

07:49.844 --> 07:52.138
-That's not why.
-Then

07:53.181 --> 07:56.017
did Hae-won tell you to keep an eye on me?

07:56.100 --> 07:57.185
Of course not.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.813
I had no idea you'd be there.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.609
So it's just another coincidence?

08:11.991 --> 08:13.493
Or maybe not.

08:14.952 --> 08:18.498
I did think that maybe

08:19.165 --> 08:20.541
I would run into you there.

08:33.221 --> 08:35.806
If it was because
of what I said yesterday…

08:36.307 --> 08:38.226
<i>I hope you will be happy this time.</i>

08:38.309 --> 08:40.102
You want us to be happy this time?

08:40.186 --> 08:42.688
Then were we unhappy before?

08:45.107 --> 08:46.817
Don't take it to heart.

08:48.611 --> 08:51.989
To be frank,
I don't care much how you two live.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.199
Even now.

08:53.908 --> 08:56.953
I'm more worried about myself
than my daughter who didn't come home.

08:59.247 --> 09:02.416
We'll be running into each other often
because of the project,

09:02.500 --> 09:04.085
but I hope not like this.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.096
Let's do a good job, Mr. Seo.

09:39.996 --> 09:43.040
It was just a mistake.
It's not a big deal.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.793
It is a big deal.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.587
I keep making the same mistake.

09:47.670 --> 09:50.464
And that makes me anxious,
so I keep falling.

09:54.844 --> 09:55.886
Li-sa.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.515
Don't let it get to you.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.476
It means you'll get better
if you work on it.

10:03.144 --> 10:07.398
But you should be sorry
for running away and worrying us.

10:09.317 --> 10:12.445
Your mom couldn't sleep
and left early in the morning to find you.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.282
-She did?
-Yes.

10:18.367 --> 10:21.454
She went to Ju-yeong's house.
Didn't you see her?

10:39.513 --> 10:40.598
Li-sa.

10:46.520 --> 10:50.524
To me, no one is
more precious than you are.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.819
That's all you need to know.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.864
Let me go. You're drenched.

11:34.402 --> 11:38.823
It may have seemed useless,

11:38.906 --> 11:41.033
but look at how much they've grown.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.829
I should make your mom
some hangover soup with this.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.123
I'll add a bunch of garlic.

11:50.626 --> 11:53.337
When will she grow up?

12:03.305 --> 12:07.435
You just can't give up on him, can you?

12:14.150 --> 12:17.486
Fine. Do as you wish.

12:19.488 --> 12:23.742
It's not like
I can stop you from loving him.

12:27.913 --> 12:31.333
LEE JU-YEONG SENT A PHOTO

12:56.692 --> 13:00.029
<i>Hae-won! Gu Hae-won!</i>

14:04.260 --> 14:07.221
DIRECTOR AN HYEON-SEONG

14:08.055 --> 14:12.226
RESTRICTED NUMBER

14:33.956 --> 14:36.917
Your phone was vibrating,
but I couldn't find it.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.586
Did you leave it here?

14:39.169 --> 14:40.337
Right.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.888
You have two phones? Why?

14:48.971 --> 14:52.099
This is my work phone.
I use this for work-related matters.

14:55.144 --> 14:56.312
Did you get some sleep?

14:56.896 --> 15:00.733
Yes. But I still feel under the weather.
I should go.

15:01.442 --> 15:04.695
Make sure you pick up Li-sa
from her dance studio.

15:04.778 --> 15:05.613
Okay.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.490
-Bye.
-Bye.

15:16.540 --> 15:19.627
<i>He's definitely cheating on you
if he has two phones.</i>

15:21.337 --> 15:23.589
Could your ex

15:23.672 --> 15:27.885
get me my husband's call records?
I want to see if it's really for work.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.388
I can ask him,
but are you sure about this?

15:31.472 --> 15:34.892
It's better to be certain
than to torment myself with doubts.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.561
What if he's really cheating?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.813
What do you think? I'll turn a blind eye.

15:40.397 --> 15:41.941
Then why bother looking into it?

15:43.776 --> 15:47.237
Being uncertain and turning a blind eye
are very different things.

15:48.948 --> 15:52.284
I guess looking the other way
lets it end as a fling.

15:53.327 --> 15:57.706
You must protect
your marriage until you grow old.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.125
You have too much to lose
if you get a divorce.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.380
It can't be her, right?

16:05.464 --> 16:08.425
The woman who came here last time.
She seemed feisty.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.427
Maybe she's taking revenge on you.

16:10.511 --> 16:11.929
Right before her wedding?

16:12.012 --> 16:14.765
What? Isn't she already married?

16:14.848 --> 16:16.350
They didn't have a wedding yet.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.227
Why would she have it now?

16:18.811 --> 16:20.437
Maybe she's warning you.

16:21.021 --> 16:23.691
"He's mine,
so don't you dare touch him again."

16:23.774 --> 16:24.984
Something like that.

16:27.236 --> 16:31.073
That's so pointless.
Why would I go through that hell again?

17:04.732 --> 17:05.607
Hey.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.069
Don't leave without telling me.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.281
I didn't want to wake you.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.119
I thought you ran away again.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.415
I'm sorry.

17:24.293 --> 17:25.419
Get some rest.

17:36.013 --> 17:38.932
<i>There's no point in holding onto him.</i>

17:39.433 --> 17:43.812
Doing that won't do you any good.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.483
Abandon him and live your life.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.946
But I can't abandon him.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.120
Because I am…

18:01.914 --> 18:03.290
the abandoned one here.

18:21.809 --> 18:24.353
Ho-su, let's go home.

18:24.436 --> 18:25.854
Thank you, Mother.

18:25.938 --> 18:29.566
Sure. Massage my legs before you go
if you're thankful.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.069
My legs are swollen.

18:39.576 --> 18:40.744
Where's Li-sa?

18:40.828 --> 18:43.330
Hyeon-seong just picked her up
from her dance studio.

18:44.998 --> 18:46.917
How dare she run away from home?

18:48.252 --> 18:51.672
She didn't. She told him
she'd be sleeping over at her friend's.

18:52.172 --> 18:56.093
How can you control her
when you didn't receive proper discipline?

18:56.176 --> 18:59.221
If you can't handle her,
we'll just hire an expert.

19:00.973 --> 19:03.976
The entrance exam is just around
the corner, so she's sensitive.

19:04.059 --> 19:07.062
All the more reason why
you should hire an expert.

19:08.772 --> 19:13.026
Only those who have no money
argue that kids need their mother's touch.

19:17.656 --> 19:18.782
That feels nice.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.786
You sure are dexterous.

19:24.037 --> 19:27.624
I'd rather have you massage me
than call a masseuse.

19:32.296 --> 19:36.216
We need to do what we're good at.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.453
JEONG HUI-JU

20:06.371 --> 20:08.290
Sir, be careful with that.

20:11.084 --> 20:13.462
Have all these paintings been--

20:13.545 --> 20:16.006
They were purchased
at the beginning of the exhibition.

20:16.089 --> 20:19.927
Some of the buyers wanted them sooner,
so we already sent out a few yesterday.

20:24.681 --> 20:27.059
Who bought that painting?

20:29.603 --> 20:31.647
That's one of my favorites,

20:31.730 --> 20:33.565
so I'm just curious.

20:42.699 --> 20:44.701
What's with this awkwardness?

20:49.998 --> 20:50.958
Let me.

20:56.004 --> 21:00.550
Congratulations on the success
of your exhibition.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.055
It was unfortunate that I was in a rush.

21:05.138 --> 21:07.849
But it went smoothly all thanks to you.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.643
You know that your works will be hung

21:09.726 --> 21:11.645
at Yangjin Group's new headquarters,
right?

21:12.229 --> 21:15.565
I'll make sure
they're displayed in the best spots.

21:15.649 --> 21:16.692
Thank you.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.319
Maybe we can talk about this in private.

21:20.445 --> 21:21.738
Silly me.

21:25.075 --> 21:28.870
I wanted you to see some
of Mr. Woo's works before meeting him.

21:30.122 --> 21:34.710
Let me thank you again for
accepting this offer for Mr. Seo's sake.

21:37.087 --> 21:37.963
Thank you.

21:57.524 --> 21:58.608
What's wrong?

22:00.819 --> 22:02.654
I can't understand a thing he's saying.

22:04.531 --> 22:07.159
You don't have to understand language
to understand art.

22:09.453 --> 22:12.581
It was selfish of me to steal
your opportunity and pursue this.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.124
I can wait.

22:15.667 --> 22:16.793
I'm still young.

22:33.393 --> 22:34.519
Ho-su.

22:42.736 --> 22:44.237
Go to sleep.

23:41.503 --> 23:44.673
I've always been a fan of Mr. Woo's work.

23:44.756 --> 23:47.676
I'm not doing this for anyone
or doing you a favor.

23:47.759 --> 23:50.554
Mr. Woo will be meeting us there,

23:50.637 --> 23:52.347
so let's all take my car.

23:52.430 --> 23:54.057
I'll drop you off here again.

23:54.683 --> 23:55.725
Okay.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.398
<i>This is Mr. Woo Jeong-hyo.</i>

24:01.481 --> 24:03.692
This is Ms. Jeong Hui-ju.

24:03.775 --> 24:05.402
-And this is
-Hello.

24:05.485 --> 24:06.778
Mr. Seo Woo-jae.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.155
Thank you for coming.

24:08.238 --> 24:10.448
Shall we go inside?

24:10.532 --> 24:11.533
-Okay.
-Okay.

24:57.787 --> 24:58.705
What do you think?

24:59.289 --> 25:02.834
It's a pity that this place
will be demolished after the exhibition.

25:02.918 --> 25:05.629
That's the downside of architectural art.

25:06.213 --> 25:07.631
It's different from other art.

25:08.798 --> 25:10.717
Since they're built for use,

25:10.800 --> 25:14.971
they're bound to wear down and disappear.

25:15.055 --> 25:17.641
Besides, this place
has been abandoned for too long.

25:17.724 --> 25:21.811
To keep something for a long time,
effort and sacrifice are needed.

25:22.437 --> 25:23.480
You're right.

25:24.022 --> 25:26.942
Now that I've grown older,
I finally realize how hard it is

25:27.651 --> 25:29.611
to protect what's already mine.

25:31.029 --> 25:32.614
You're still very young though.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.951
-Let's go.
-Okay.

26:08.441 --> 26:10.110
She's getting her car.

26:30.130 --> 26:33.216
Ms. Lee left first to drive Mr. Woo.

26:33.717 --> 26:35.719
I'll drop you off at the gallery.

26:39.681 --> 26:41.599
TOP TEN BILLIARD HALL

26:41.683 --> 26:44.019
FINAL NOTICE OF DEMOLITION

26:46.855 --> 26:48.398
Gosh, it's so messy.

26:48.481 --> 26:50.275
-Let's put one here.
-Sure.

26:51.901 --> 26:53.570
-Up here?
-Over there.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.488
My gosh!

26:55.572 --> 26:56.781
Don't touch my property.

26:56.865 --> 26:59.367
-Sir! Please calm down!
-Leave.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.244
-Sir!
-Get away from here, you bastards!

27:01.328 --> 27:03.038
-You're going to hurt someone!
-Leave!

27:03.121 --> 27:04.956
That's enough! Sir!

27:13.965 --> 27:17.302
We've given you more than enough time.

27:18.136 --> 27:20.472
You're the one
who rejected all our offers.

27:20.555 --> 27:22.640
You mean that chump change?

27:23.683 --> 27:25.643
This area is pretty much dead.

27:25.727 --> 27:28.855
Holding out here
won't bring it back to life, will it?

27:42.702 --> 27:45.038
Think of your daughter.

27:45.580 --> 27:46.998
She's very talented.

27:47.082 --> 27:50.335
Shouldn't you help her attend
the school of her dreams?

27:50.418 --> 27:54.172
That's exactly why I can't leave.
If I leave, we'll die.

27:54.255 --> 27:56.007
We'll all die!

28:03.139 --> 28:05.016
Hold out here, and you'll also die.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.398
TOP TEN BILLIARD HALL

28:31.000 --> 28:33.545
We'll all die. We'll just all die.

28:33.628 --> 28:35.588
Die!

28:35.672 --> 28:36.714
Die!

29:02.699 --> 29:04.743
If it feels stuffy,
I'll turn off the heater.

29:05.326 --> 29:08.413
You were dry coughing. It's cold out.

29:16.337 --> 29:19.048
LEE JU-YEONG

29:19.132 --> 29:22.302
Hey, Ju-yeong.
I'm driving right now. What is it?

29:22.385 --> 29:24.637
<i>Ms. Gu, what should I do?</i>

29:37.609 --> 29:38.943
How did you know I was here?

29:39.027 --> 29:41.112
Does that even matter right now?

29:41.780 --> 29:42.947
What happened?

29:43.031 --> 29:44.491
It's nothing.

29:44.574 --> 29:47.577
How could you say that
when you cut your forehead?

29:50.163 --> 29:51.581
The CT scan came out fine.

29:51.664 --> 29:53.249
He just needs to treat his wound.

29:54.334 --> 29:56.711
Let's ask another doctor
to treat me, not my sister.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.463
I already did.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.633
You need to be admitted
for us to be at an advantage.

30:02.550 --> 30:03.843
I should do that.

30:03.927 --> 30:07.639
I won't settle with him
until he accepts the compensation.

30:07.722 --> 30:10.642
Rather, you should demand
compensation from him.

30:10.725 --> 30:12.852
He's at a disadvantage.

30:12.936 --> 30:15.897
This is a special assault case
since he hit you with a cue stick.

30:16.940 --> 30:18.525
I'm fine. You can relax.

30:18.608 --> 30:20.610
It's just a work-related matter,

30:20.693 --> 30:22.111
and it's going well.

30:24.197 --> 30:25.657
Honey, did you…

30:27.242 --> 30:29.244
get hit on purpose?

30:31.162 --> 30:33.331
I wasn't going to actually hit him.

30:33.414 --> 30:36.125
I was just swinging it around,

30:36.209 --> 30:38.086
but he approached me and got hit.

30:38.169 --> 30:41.047
That still doesn't change the fact
that you assaulted him.

30:41.130 --> 30:45.134
But how could I sit still
and watch them post those notices?

30:45.218 --> 30:46.636
How could I?

30:46.719 --> 30:48.888
Remember what you told me?

30:48.972 --> 30:51.808
You said not to give up
and that we had enough time.

30:51.891 --> 30:54.185
So what is this
sudden notice of demolition?

30:54.269 --> 30:57.814
Does this make any sense to you?
Of course not.

31:28.553 --> 31:31.723
Take her to our house.
She shouldn't be alone.

31:40.148 --> 31:42.525
-What about you?
-I can stay at the studio.

31:42.609 --> 31:43.443
Go on.

31:59.208 --> 32:02.503
<i>Your call could not be made.
After the tone…</i>

32:54.138 --> 32:55.348
Yes?

32:55.431 --> 32:57.350
<i>Ma'am, you have a visitor.</i>

32:58.476 --> 32:59.769
At this hour?

32:59.852 --> 33:01.896
<i>He's here to give you your bag.</i>

33:10.863 --> 33:12.115
Where's my bag?

33:12.198 --> 33:14.158
He wants to give it to you himself.

33:26.754 --> 33:28.464
You weren't picking up, so…

33:31.300 --> 33:33.219
Ms. Lee gave me your address.

33:34.804 --> 33:36.431
Here's your bag.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.851
Thank you. Goodbye, then.

33:39.934 --> 33:40.810
Wait.

33:42.562 --> 33:44.439
I wasn't meaning to look, but…

33:49.777 --> 33:53.114
Are these my sketches?

33:54.741 --> 33:55.950
What?

33:57.702 --> 33:58.828
They are, aren't they?

34:00.455 --> 34:01.289
Of course not.

34:02.123 --> 34:05.251
If that was the case,
why would I have them?

34:06.210 --> 34:07.295
Goodbye.

34:21.934 --> 34:24.145
SECURITY

35:17.824 --> 35:19.534
<i>There was a visitor.</i>

35:21.536 --> 35:22.620
VISITOR NOTICE

35:56.946 --> 35:59.323
What are you doing here without the girl?

35:59.949 --> 36:01.742
She must've been tired. She's asleep.

36:02.243 --> 36:03.661
Where have you been?

36:04.245 --> 36:06.080
I went to give back Ms. Jeong's bag.

36:08.166 --> 36:11.627
She had left it in the car,
and you had a lot on your mind.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.550
-At this hour?
-I left it there.

36:18.968 --> 36:20.428
At the maintenance office.

36:23.347 --> 36:27.143
She had brought it with her to the site,
so I thought she'd need it.

36:32.815 --> 36:35.109
You seem to be quite concerned about her.

36:35.693 --> 36:37.612
She provided me with a great opportunity.

36:38.779 --> 36:42.366
And since we'll be working together,
we'll have to…

36:52.668 --> 36:55.880
You just need to fill this in.
I'll take care of the rest.

37:03.554 --> 37:05.932
MARRIAGE VOW

37:07.600 --> 37:09.268
There will be no officiant.

37:09.352 --> 37:11.395
They just read their vows nowadays.

37:20.154 --> 37:22.073
What is it? Do you not want to?

37:23.574 --> 37:24.700
No.

37:26.035 --> 37:28.204
It's just all very sudden for me.

37:29.372 --> 37:30.957
Can you give me some time?

37:32.750 --> 37:34.627
I've waited way far too long.

37:36.045 --> 37:38.422
You should yield to me this time.

37:56.565 --> 37:59.277
TAERIM HOSPITAL

38:14.959 --> 38:17.420
You know that Mr. Lee had no intention

38:18.379 --> 38:19.630
of harming you.

38:20.423 --> 38:22.466
Please settle and let him out.

38:22.967 --> 38:25.136
He's Ju-yeong's sole guardian.

38:25.219 --> 38:29.473
Didn't I already tell you
that this was a losing game?

38:29.557 --> 38:31.767
You shouldn't have given him false hope.

38:32.351 --> 38:34.520
And you're responsible for turning him

38:34.603 --> 38:37.440
into a fighter when he should've
just taken the compensation.

38:37.940 --> 38:40.192
You're the one who rushed the process.

38:40.818 --> 38:43.195
Not everyone in the building
consented to this.

38:43.279 --> 38:46.240
Also, the tenants deserve some time
even if the lessor consented--

38:46.324 --> 38:47.241
Ms. Gu.

38:50.411 --> 38:51.620
Make up your mind.

38:52.204 --> 38:54.081
Either protect your family

38:54.165 --> 38:56.417
or put up a useless fight for justice.

39:01.130 --> 39:02.590
I shouldn't laugh.

39:04.592 --> 39:06.635
But I can empathize with you.

39:08.763 --> 39:12.099
You're willing to wreak havoc
to protect something.

39:13.392 --> 39:15.436
I know how that feels.

39:17.021 --> 39:18.397
But sir,

39:18.481 --> 39:22.276
don't corner those
who have nowhere else to go.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.530
My grandfather once told me this.

39:27.323 --> 39:30.826
"Since trees are deeply rooted
and can't flee,

39:31.410 --> 39:35.539
they emit reeking smells or poison

39:35.623 --> 39:38.417
to scare their enemies away."

39:44.924 --> 39:46.008
Hey.

39:54.433 --> 39:55.601
Did you not hear me?

39:58.354 --> 39:59.980
Fine. What is it?

40:01.607 --> 40:03.150
Look at you.

40:03.234 --> 40:06.570
Not only are you a homewrecker,
but you're brazen as well.

40:07.613 --> 40:09.824
You should tell that to someone else.

40:09.907 --> 40:11.742
We were just discussing school matters.

40:11.826 --> 40:14.161
You should've discussed that at school.

40:15.371 --> 40:17.581
You even came to his house, didn't you?

40:17.665 --> 40:19.208
How shameless of you.

40:19.959 --> 40:22.086
I've never done anything shameful.

40:22.169 --> 40:24.463
How dare you talk back to me?

40:24.547 --> 40:29.427
Hey. Did you grow up
without any parents? Did you?

40:30.010 --> 40:32.763
Yes. I never had
impudent parents like you.

40:32.847 --> 40:35.766
-Ms. Gu.
-You're a lost cause, aren't you?

40:36.434 --> 40:38.811
-You should go.
-A lost cause?

40:38.894 --> 40:40.354
You should watch what you say.

40:40.438 --> 40:43.315
You should never be quick
to judge someone like that.

40:43.399 --> 40:45.484
Never. Got that?

40:45.568 --> 40:46.694
How dare you talk back?

40:46.777 --> 40:50.197
I'm not the lost cause here. It's--

40:52.741 --> 40:54.285
What do you think you're doing?

40:55.286 --> 40:58.038
Was pestering me not enough?

40:58.747 --> 41:01.167
Mother, go inside. People are watching.

41:01.792 --> 41:04.378
Why do you want her to leave?
Scared of what I'll say?

41:04.462 --> 41:05.921
No, it's a waste of time.

41:06.881 --> 41:09.175
No matter what you do,
nothing will change.

41:26.358 --> 41:27.193
I'm sorry.

41:28.652 --> 41:30.738
I'm sorry.

41:31.780 --> 41:34.867
Don't apologize!

41:34.950 --> 41:36.535
Don't apologize!

41:37.036 --> 41:38.454
-Let me go!
-Mother, let's go.

41:38.537 --> 41:40.039
Please, Hae-won.

41:44.460 --> 41:46.587
Let me go!

41:49.173 --> 41:52.176
This is exactly why
I told you to change hospitals.

42:15.157 --> 42:17.201
-Why did you apologize?
-Hae-won.

42:17.284 --> 42:18.827
You should've defended me.

42:19.495 --> 42:22.623
Just because I acted like a crazy bitch
doesn't mean I was wrong.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.501
Did you not think
that maybe I was the victim?

42:25.584 --> 42:27.628
Then you should've said so
instead of yelling.

42:27.711 --> 42:29.213
I couldn't get through to them!

42:32.258 --> 42:34.885
They couldn't understand me
when I was being nice.

42:41.433 --> 42:42.935
You weren't like this before.

42:45.563 --> 42:46.564
Really?

42:48.607 --> 42:50.818
I don't remember the person I used to be.

42:53.404 --> 42:54.822
So tell me.

42:55.864 --> 42:57.616
What was I like?

43:07.835 --> 43:09.795
He's right, Mother.

43:09.878 --> 43:12.047
She wanted him to settle
yesterday's incident.

43:12.131 --> 43:14.383
It's not what you think it is.

43:14.466 --> 43:16.969
If that was the case,
I would've caught on.

43:17.052 --> 43:20.806
All men are bound to be seduced
if a woman sets her mind to it.

43:21.390 --> 43:24.226
I'm only saying this
because of her attitude towards you.

43:24.310 --> 43:25.644
You better be careful.

43:26.228 --> 43:28.814
I'm absolutely sick and tired of affairs.

43:38.657 --> 43:43.829
<i>Your husband mainly used that phone
to make international calls.</i>

43:44.371 --> 43:45.539
Really?

43:45.623 --> 43:47.666
<i>That's all that we know.</i>

43:47.750 --> 43:50.502
<i>I'll text the call records to you,
so check later.</i>

43:51.670 --> 43:53.339
Okay. Thanks.

44:05.184 --> 44:07.853
MEAL AND DRINKS

44:07.936 --> 44:10.397
RICE MEAL
LUNCH SPECIALS

44:12.941 --> 44:14.109
Hello.

44:20.282 --> 44:21.408
What's wrong?

44:22.951 --> 44:23.869
Did someone hit you?

44:25.996 --> 44:27.998
-Does it show?
-Who was it?

44:29.249 --> 44:30.668
That guy you're seeing again?

44:31.752 --> 44:32.878
No.

44:33.545 --> 44:36.423
I wouldn't have waited for him
if he were that kind of man.

44:42.805 --> 44:43.931
Then was it…

44:46.517 --> 44:47.851
that woman from before?

44:55.067 --> 44:56.610
She's the one who hit me,

44:57.319 --> 44:59.530
but I'm more upset with Woo-jae.

45:00.114 --> 45:02.658
We tend to be more upset
with those we are close with.

45:03.742 --> 45:05.994
They say when a couple gets back together,

45:06.954 --> 45:10.374
there's a higher chance
that they'll break up again.

45:10.457 --> 45:13.210
Come on. Statistics don't matter.

45:14.211 --> 45:17.005
Those who are bound to break up
are destined to do so.

45:17.965 --> 45:19.341
Then there are those

45:19.842 --> 45:22.136
who become more cautious
and never break up again.

45:23.470 --> 45:25.514
I wonder which one it'll be.

45:27.766 --> 45:29.143
Aren't you seeing him again

45:30.018 --> 45:31.812
so you can work things out?

45:32.563 --> 45:33.522
No.

45:34.481 --> 45:36.150
I'm talking about them, not me.

45:36.900 --> 45:37.818
What?

45:38.485 --> 45:40.612
When Woo-jae left me,

45:41.822 --> 45:44.032
this is what I heard most about me.

45:47.828 --> 45:49.788
"It was just a guy."

45:53.584 --> 45:55.252
"She's a fool…

45:57.713 --> 46:01.216
for letting a guy ruin her entire life."

46:03.760 --> 46:05.888
"She must've done something wrong."

46:11.768 --> 46:13.604
Those who don't know the story

46:14.688 --> 46:16.106
gossip the most.

46:16.190 --> 46:18.442
If they did, they could never do that.

46:18.525 --> 46:19.359
You're right.

46:20.611 --> 46:23.113
He may have just been "a guy" to them,

46:23.906 --> 46:26.867
but to me, he was a friend, lover,

46:27.868 --> 46:30.370
the world, and the universe.

46:33.040 --> 46:34.875
I was the victim,

46:35.417 --> 46:37.836
but they criticized me for being a fool.

46:41.298 --> 46:42.674
That's so harsh.

46:48.597 --> 46:50.182
So I hope

46:51.225 --> 46:53.644
they'll go through what I've been through.

47:03.195 --> 47:05.072
-Is it true?
-What?

47:05.155 --> 47:06.823
Did Ju-yeong's dad really do that?

47:09.034 --> 47:12.621
Li-sa. I'm sorry, but you should stop
hanging out with her for the time being.

47:12.704 --> 47:13.997
Will he go to jail?

47:14.081 --> 47:15.832
Nothing is certain yet.

47:15.916 --> 47:17.334
What will happen to Ju-yeong?

47:19.711 --> 47:23.715
She'll be staying with Ms. Gu,
so don't worry about her.

47:23.799 --> 47:25.259
I need to rest.

47:25.926 --> 47:27.010
Dad.

47:29.805 --> 47:32.432
What happened? Tell me.

47:32.516 --> 47:33.642
Why won't you tell me?

47:33.725 --> 47:36.311
I'm fine. Have you eaten dinner yet?

47:36.395 --> 47:38.730
What? Don't change the subject.

47:38.814 --> 47:42.109
AN HYEON-SEONG'S CALL RECORDS

47:49.199 --> 47:54.955
INTERNATIONAL CALLS

48:21.815 --> 48:24.443
Couples often fight
while planning their wedding.

48:24.526 --> 48:27.863
Exactly. They fight
over the most trivial things.

48:27.946 --> 48:29.781
Do you really have to have a wedding?

48:30.490 --> 48:32.200
Not like you've had one before.

48:33.243 --> 48:37.289
Anyway, men aren't attracted
to clingy women.

48:37.372 --> 48:40.542
They find independent ones more alluring.

48:40.626 --> 48:43.503
Do you remember
how you felt on your wedding day?

48:44.421 --> 48:46.423
I was exhausted, and it was a hassle.

48:47.466 --> 48:50.886
But you should try it out
to realize that it's nothing special.

48:50.969 --> 48:53.472
See? He has experience
and says it's nothing special.

48:53.555 --> 48:55.682
I'm just saying,

48:55.766 --> 48:58.810
married life isn't all about
some magnificent love or happiness.

48:59.811 --> 49:04.650
It's about sticking with each other
through thick and thin.

49:04.733 --> 49:05.651
That's what I mean.

49:09.029 --> 49:10.864
Fine, you're all better than me.

49:12.824 --> 49:14.618
Like I know anything.

49:15.994 --> 49:19.164
You'll be a part of it.
I can't do it alone.

49:19.247 --> 49:21.124
First, get a nice outfit.

49:21.208 --> 49:23.168
No. I hate <i>hanbok</i>.

49:23.251 --> 49:26.004
The stiff shoulders
make my neck look short.

49:26.922 --> 49:28.465
Then you can wear a dress too.

49:29.383 --> 49:30.300
A dress?

49:30.384 --> 49:33.220
It won't be formal,
so wear whatever you want.

49:34.721 --> 49:39.101
Gosh, are you serious?
Can I really do that?

49:40.936 --> 49:42.521
I'd love that.

49:54.658 --> 49:56.618
I heard there was a ruckus
at the hospital.

49:57.619 --> 50:01.748
My father only cheated once. Just once.

50:02.874 --> 50:05.127
And you know what my mother did, right?

50:05.210 --> 50:08.213
He lived like her slave for decades.

50:08.296 --> 50:11.508
When he retired, he said
he'd done enough and asked for a divorce.

50:12.426 --> 50:15.512
I empathized with him.
He really did enough.

50:16.805 --> 50:21.143
But she didn't budge an inch.

50:21.226 --> 50:24.229
He lived like a prisoner
until his last breath.

50:25.272 --> 50:28.150
I guess the wound of betrayal
lasts a lifetime.

50:29.359 --> 50:31.153
Why are you bringing that up here?

50:32.195 --> 50:35.031
My mom will never condone cheating

50:35.115 --> 50:37.659
even if it's her own son, so don't worry.

50:37.743 --> 50:41.121
I don't. I trust Hyeon-seong.

50:41.204 --> 50:42.706
Don't be so sure, though.

50:43.457 --> 50:46.752
After all, we even lie in our diaries.

50:48.128 --> 50:51.590
I'm sorry. Your measurements changed,
so I had to adjust them.

50:53.383 --> 50:54.509
I'm fine.

50:57.846 --> 50:58.847
Goodness.

50:58.930 --> 51:02.601
Look at the quality of these clothes.
For heaven's sake.

51:03.477 --> 51:06.730
Oh, my. It's that crazy bitch from before.

51:15.822 --> 51:18.366
Hello, Dr. An.
What a surprise running into you here.

51:18.450 --> 51:20.911
It is. What brings you here?

51:21.495 --> 51:24.456
I heard Ms. Jeong
gets her dresses fitted here.

51:24.539 --> 51:27.334
I loved the outfit
she wore for her exhibition.

51:27.417 --> 51:29.795
So I came to get a dress here
for a special occasion.

51:34.633 --> 51:36.259
Can I have a cup of tea, please?

51:40.388 --> 51:42.057
What kind of special--

51:42.724 --> 51:44.309
Take out all the pins.

51:45.101 --> 51:46.019
I'm sorry.

52:09.417 --> 52:13.922
After yesterday's commotion,
you still want my blessing?

52:15.632 --> 52:18.051
Please don't take to heart
what happened that day.

52:18.134 --> 52:20.428
I can forgive you for slapping my face.

52:21.513 --> 52:23.223
But not for stabbing me in the back.

52:26.226 --> 52:27.811
I want to be like you, Hui-ju.

52:29.437 --> 52:30.272
What?

52:30.355 --> 52:33.191
I wondered how you could pretend…

52:33.275 --> 52:37.153
No, live as if nothing ever happened.

52:37.946 --> 52:39.322
I gave it some thought.

52:42.117 --> 52:44.119
You just have to let go of the guilt.

52:46.204 --> 52:50.208
Once you let go of that guilt
and become unapologetic,

52:50.292 --> 52:51.668
you become shameless.

52:52.419 --> 52:53.587
Just like you.

52:55.422 --> 52:56.631
Please come.

53:00.093 --> 53:01.344
<i>In Ireland?</i>

53:01.845 --> 53:05.390
His foundation has
an overseas business department,

53:05.473 --> 53:07.267
and all the numbers were from there.

53:07.350 --> 53:09.144
What if he has a mistress in Ireland?

53:09.227 --> 53:11.146
International lovers do exist.

53:11.229 --> 53:13.106
Call the number and check for yourself.

53:13.189 --> 53:15.859
You came all the way here to tell me that?

53:15.942 --> 53:17.485
That and something else.

53:21.740 --> 53:23.742
What's her deal?
We barely know each other.

53:25.827 --> 53:28.538
She gave this to me in person,

53:29.247 --> 53:31.917
and I couldn't help but wonder
why she was going that far.

53:33.251 --> 53:34.544
She gave one to me too.

53:35.295 --> 53:37.839
What a lunatic. Are you going?

53:39.174 --> 53:40.425
What if she invited

53:40.508 --> 53:42.886
your friends instead of hers
out of vengeance?

53:42.969 --> 53:46.848
She dreamed of this wedding,
so I doubt she'd want to ruin it.

53:46.932 --> 53:47.891
That's true.

53:48.934 --> 53:50.977
Still, you should be on your toes

53:52.604 --> 53:54.481
if you want to keep all of this.

54:00.236 --> 54:01.363
COMPLAINT LETTER
PLAINTIFF: LEE IL-SEONG

54:01.446 --> 54:02.989
We're going to argue

54:03.073 --> 54:06.284
that his billiard hall
isn't included on the school site.

54:07.202 --> 54:09.996
Then you'll have to measure
the area once again.

54:10.580 --> 54:11.581
Ms. Gu.

54:12.499 --> 54:13.583
Hae-won.

54:13.667 --> 54:17.003
Strictly speaking,
it's not even a part of the school.

54:17.879 --> 54:19.547
It'll be a part of the gallery.

54:23.718 --> 54:25.720
Why waste your energy on this?

54:25.804 --> 54:27.764
If we lose, we'll appeal.

54:29.265 --> 54:31.601
At least that'll help us buy some time.

54:31.685 --> 54:34.980
Fine. If the compensation
is the problem, we can renegotiate--

54:35.063 --> 54:35.981
Let him out first.

54:37.357 --> 54:38.984
He may be a mess,

54:39.859 --> 54:41.903
but Ju-yeong still needs a guardian.

54:46.700 --> 54:47.867
Please.

54:50.912 --> 54:54.916
And please tell Hui-ju I said thanks.

54:55.834 --> 54:57.335
I'm truly grateful

54:57.919 --> 55:01.923
that she decided
to work with Woo-jae on the project.

55:10.598 --> 55:13.393
<i>Ms. Lee proposed the offer
to your wife first.</i>

55:14.811 --> 55:18.857
It was Mr. Woo's third collaboration
with Hwain Gallery.

55:18.940 --> 55:21.568
She was also the one
who recommended Mr. Seo.

55:24.988 --> 55:27.824
I'm sure your wife
was pressured into accepting the offer.

55:29.701 --> 55:30.827
Will he be here soon?

55:30.910 --> 55:32.162
Yes, sir.

55:32.245 --> 55:34.873
Among the critics
who disapprove of Ms. Lee's success,

55:35.415 --> 55:36.875
he's the most influential one.

55:45.341 --> 55:47.177
Welcome. It's nice to meet you.

55:50.013 --> 55:54.601
<i>The gallery sugarcoats rookie artists
and help them gain fame?</i>

55:55.226 --> 56:00.023
<i>I'm sure that can't always be
in the artists' best interest.</i>

56:01.441 --> 56:03.151
<i>You can just state the facts.</i>

56:03.651 --> 56:05.403
<i>That'll be enough.</i>

56:07.572 --> 56:08.990
"FABRICATED" ROOKIE ARTISTS
IN THE ART COMMUNITY

56:09.074 --> 56:13.620
Didn't you say Mr. Seo was
well-received among the critics?

56:14.204 --> 56:17.665
How could they bash a project
that has yet to be launched?

56:17.749 --> 56:19.000
This is a problem.

56:19.084 --> 56:22.921
Park Jae-gwan is
the operation director of Korea Art Week

56:23.004 --> 56:24.756
and the editor of <i>ARTicle</i>,

56:24.839 --> 56:27.342
the most influential journal
among art collectors.

56:27.425 --> 56:30.887
For such a powerful journal
to dedicate an entire page

56:30.970 --> 56:36.059
to criticize a rookie artist must mean
that they're very much interested in him.

56:36.142 --> 56:38.269
"An exhibition
by one of the top art galleries

56:38.853 --> 56:41.356
alongside a popular artist…"

56:41.439 --> 56:43.024
This must be me.

56:43.858 --> 56:48.613
"And an architect who received
an outstanding award."

56:49.531 --> 56:51.241
They're just envious.

56:52.117 --> 56:55.036
They're just criticizing us
because they're jealous.

56:55.703 --> 56:58.081
They can only be so quick to judge

56:58.164 --> 57:00.917
because they've never
created art themselves.

57:08.299 --> 57:09.968
Am I late?

57:10.051 --> 57:13.263
Not at all. We just came early.
Have a seat, Mr. Seo.

57:17.100 --> 57:18.059
Here.

57:22.230 --> 57:24.566
What terrible weather.

57:24.649 --> 57:27.444
You're right. It's still very windy.

57:27.527 --> 57:28.778
Please excuse me.

58:10.862 --> 58:11.905
It was an accident.

58:11.988 --> 58:14.741
There's nothing we can do
about natural disasters.

58:14.824 --> 58:18.411
That's okay. It's not like
accidents happen with a warning.

58:40.141 --> 58:42.685
I planted that tree.

58:45.146 --> 58:47.899
This used to be my father's studio.

58:48.608 --> 58:50.527
It's my only inheritance.

58:52.820 --> 58:57.116
There used to be
a very old tree in its place.

58:58.117 --> 59:01.371
But when I was young,
it was struck by lightning.

59:05.041 --> 59:07.669
That was the first time
I'd seen my father cry.

59:10.171 --> 59:12.215
But why are you smiling?

59:16.135 --> 59:18.846
I was happy to know

59:19.889 --> 59:21.015
that he could cry too.

59:22.934 --> 59:26.604
That's why I planted
a new tree in the same spot.

59:28.565 --> 59:30.608
But I can't believe it died as well.

59:31.901 --> 59:34.279
Maybe you picked the wrong tree.

59:36.489 --> 59:37.323
Sorry?

59:37.991 --> 59:39.909
That's a Chinese lacquer tree.

59:42.036 --> 59:47.667
Unlike others, Chinese lacquer trees
don't become magnificent as they age.

59:48.167 --> 59:50.253
The branches become thin,

59:51.087 --> 59:52.880
and they wither away.

59:55.592 --> 59:57.927
Perhaps it's best for them

59:59.178 --> 1:00:01.639
to meet their fate
before they turn out that way.

1:00:05.643 --> 1:00:11.482
But their sap leaves behind
beautiful works of art.

1:00:12.191 --> 1:00:13.651
They're quite fascinating.

1:00:23.661 --> 1:00:24.662
What is it?

1:00:27.332 --> 1:00:29.042
So this is how you sound

1:00:30.043 --> 1:00:31.628
when you're not upset.

1:00:36.174 --> 1:00:38.259
You have a lovely voice.

1:00:53.941 --> 1:00:55.610
<i>Why are you staring at me?</i>

1:00:56.194 --> 1:00:57.528
Because you're fascinating.

1:00:59.280 --> 1:01:02.784
Do you know you frown instead of
scratching them when your eyes are itchy?

1:01:03.576 --> 1:01:06.287
You touch your ears
if you're not happy with your work.

1:01:06.371 --> 1:01:08.873
And your lips swell when you're tired.

1:01:10.166 --> 1:01:12.460
Stop teasing me. Last time…

1:01:13.628 --> 1:01:15.338
When I said you were beautiful?

1:01:16.964 --> 1:01:18.341
I meant it.

1:01:18.424 --> 1:01:20.218
Don't you know I'm married?

1:01:21.511 --> 1:01:22.804
So?

1:01:22.887 --> 1:01:24.847
Being married or having kids

1:01:25.556 --> 1:01:28.184
doesn't affect your beauty.

1:01:30.353 --> 1:01:33.189
It all disappears with age.
It becomes useless.

1:01:33.898 --> 1:01:36.192
Beauty doesn't disappear.

1:01:36.901 --> 1:01:38.069
It just changes.

1:01:52.583 --> 1:01:54.210
I should get going.

1:01:58.798 --> 1:01:59.632
Wait.

1:02:01.592 --> 1:02:03.428
Thank you for what you said back there.

1:02:03.511 --> 1:02:06.806
I was going to
just ignore what critics say.

1:02:08.433 --> 1:02:10.268
But it wasn't that easy.

1:02:10.893 --> 1:02:14.397
Your words were comforting.

1:02:15.523 --> 1:02:17.358
It felt like you were defending me.

1:03:43.069 --> 1:03:45.154
INCOMING, OUTGOING CALLS

<i>However…</i>

1:05:40.728 --> 1:05:44.190
"A long river was flowing

1:05:45.024 --> 1:05:48.527
"The rushing river pierced

1:05:49.070 --> 1:05:51.197
"It glistened underneath the sunlight."

1:05:52.323 --> 1:05:54.909
"The mountains in the sky…"

CLOSED ON MONDAYS

1:07:26.083 --> 1:07:27.668
This has to be photoshopped.

1:07:28.961 --> 1:07:31.130
Where in the world are they?

1:07:32.423 --> 1:07:34.425
-Hey.
-You're so pretty.

1:07:34.508 --> 1:07:38.179
I thought it was ridiculous
to have the wedding now.

1:07:38.971 --> 1:07:41.724
But it sure makes me happy
to see you in a wedding dress.

1:07:42.808 --> 1:07:46.562
This must be why people have weddings.

1:07:48.439 --> 1:07:49.356
We should

1:07:50.107 --> 1:07:53.402
hold a party when we go back.

1:07:53.944 --> 1:07:55.821
Goodness. Dad.

1:07:55.905 --> 1:07:58.574
You shouldn't cry
on such a happy day. Don't be silly.

1:07:59.241 --> 1:08:01.952
Why are you dressed so immaturely?

1:08:02.912 --> 1:08:04.371
It's not your wedding.

1:08:06.832 --> 1:08:08.125
Don't I still look pretty?

1:08:20.137 --> 1:08:21.722
MARRIAGE VOW

1:08:36.654 --> 1:08:38.447

<i>You must not be interested in what I know.</i>

<i>I wanted to display my misfortune.</i>

<i>I wanted everyone to know</i>

<i>So you came to my wedding after all.</i>

1:12:14.955 --> 1:12:17.082
<i>I ran away because
I thought I would cause trouble.</i>

1:12:17.708 --> 1:12:20.711
Find out what those two are caught up in.

<i>What did you talk about with my husband?</i>

Give me your phone.

1:12:29.303 --> 1:12:32.431
Too bad. It could have been interesting.

1:12:32.514 --> 1:12:35.601
<i>Was it a good thing for me to come back?</i>

1:12:35.684 --> 1:12:37.186
<i>I want to see you.</i>

<i>We don't have to hide
