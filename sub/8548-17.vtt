WEBVTT

00:07.041 --> 00:08.142
SLAUGHTERED YOU AGAIN.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.244
I'M AHEAD THREE GAMES TO TWO.

00:10.311 --> 00:12.813
I WANT A RE-MATCH.
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.448
YOU SAID I COULD
PLAY THE WINNER.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.485
YOU CAN. IT'S THE BEST 51
OUT OF A HUNDRED.

00:22.590 --> 00:25.559
ALRIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.
EVERYBODY OFF TO BED.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.995
JUST ONE MORE GAME.
NO, IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

00:28.062 --> 00:32.366
YEAH. YOU SHOULD ALL GO READ A
BOOK. IT'LL IMPROVE YOUR MIND.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.368
HEY, SOMEDAY, YOU'LL
THANK ME.

00:34.435 --> 00:35.669
YEAAHHH.

00:37.838 --> 00:39.573
I THOUGHT THEY'LL NEVER LEAVE.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.222
* IT'S A RARE CONDITION *

00:54.288 --> 00:55.889
* IN THIS DAY AND AGE *

00:55.956 --> 00:59.360
* TO READ ANY GOOD NEWS
ON THE NEWSPAPER PAGE *

00:59.427 --> 01:02.596
* AND LOVE AND TRADITION
OF THE GRAND DESIGN *

01:02.663 --> 01:07.235
* SOME PEOPLE SAY
IS EVEN HARDER TO FIND *

01:07.301 --> 01:10.271
* WELL, THEN, THERE MUST BE
SOME MAGIC CLUE *

01:10.338 --> 01:14.475
* INSIDE THESE GENTLE WALLS *

01:14.542 --> 01:18.246
* 'CAUSE ALL I SEE
IS A TOWER OF DREAMS *

01:18.312 --> 01:23.083
* REAL LOVE BURSTIN'
OUT OF EVERY SEAM *

01:23.151 --> 01:26.287
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:26.354 --> 01:30.090
* WE'RE GONNA FILL OUR HOUSE
WITH HAPPINESS *

01:30.158 --> 01:32.993
* THE MOON MAY CRY *

01:33.060 --> 01:36.830
* WE'RE GONNA SMOTHER
THE BLUES WITH TENDERNESS *

01:36.897 --> 01:39.767
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:39.833 --> 01:43.704
* THERE'S ROOM FOR YOU
ROOM FOR ME *

01:43.771 --> 01:47.908
* FOR GENTLE HEARTS
AN OPPORTUNITY *

01:47.975 --> 01:51.312
* AS DAYS GO BY *

01:51.379 --> 01:56.150
* IT'S THE BIGGER LOVE
OF THE FAMILY *

02:37.525 --> 02:39.327
MOM, I'M WAY BEHIND
IN HISTORY.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.128
I GOT TO PULL
AN ALL-NIGHTER.

02:41.195 --> 02:45.699
FINE. AS LONG AS YOU'RE
IN BED BY 10:00.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.602
EDWARD, WHY IS YOUR FATHER
UNDER THE TABLE?

02:50.137 --> 02:52.273
HARRIETTE,
THIS CHAIR IS WOBBLY.

02:52.340 --> 02:54.141
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING, CARL.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.009
BUT JUST CALL THE SHOP
AND GET IT FIXED.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.478
I CAN DO THIS.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.747
ALL I GOTTA DO
IS EVEN OUT THE LEGS.

02:59.813 --> 03:03.417
I GUESS THAT MEANS WE'RE GOING
TO GET A NEW KITCHEN SET.

03:03.484 --> 03:07.788
THANK YOU FOR YOUR OVERWHELMING
VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN ME.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.557
COME ON, EDWARD. LET'S
GET BACK TO WORK.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.460
DAD, I'M TIRED.
HOW ABOUT TOMORROW?

03:12.526 --> 03:14.462
OH, I GUESS, WE CAN
KNOCK IT OFF.

03:14.528 --> 03:17.798
WELL, YOU GOT ALGEBRA
DOWN COLD ANYWAY.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.933
GOODNIGHT, EINSTEIN.

03:22.169 --> 03:24.272
GOODNIGHT, PROFESSOR.

03:25.273 --> 03:27.375
LAURA, I'M DEAD.

03:27.441 --> 03:30.311
IF I DON'T PULL AT LEAST A "C"
ON MY MIDTERM EXAM,

03:30.378 --> 03:32.480
I'M GONNA FLUNK ALGEBRA.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.315
I THOUGHT DAD
WAS A MATH WHIZ.

03:34.382 --> 03:36.450
HE IS.
THEN, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

03:36.517 --> 03:39.287
I'M THE ONE
WHO'S TAKING THE TEST.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.655
GUESS YOU'RE
OUT OF LUCK.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.157
LAURA, IF I FLUNK,
MOM AND DAD WON'T LET ME GO

03:44.224 --> 03:45.759
TO THE PRINCE CONCERT.

03:45.826 --> 03:48.896
YOU GOT TO HELP ME.
I HAVEN'T HAD ALGEBRA YET.

03:48.962 --> 03:52.300
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON
WHO CAN HELP YOU NOW--

03:52.366 --> 03:54.034
STEVE URKEL.

03:54.101 --> 03:55.336
URKEL?

03:57.305 --> 03:59.340
I'D RATHER EAT WORMS.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.310
HE CAN
TEACH YOU THAT, TOO.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.320
RACHEL, I DON'T WANT
TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS,

04:12.386 --> 04:15.589
BUT THAT LOG CABIN
IS PITIFUL.

04:17.291 --> 04:18.892
HEY, GIVE ME A BREAK.

04:18.959 --> 04:22.696
I'M ON A SUGAR HIGH FROM EATING
ALL THOSE POPSICLES.

04:22.763 --> 04:26.567
AUNT RACHEL, HURRY UP. YOU'RE
HOLDING UP THE HOMESTEAD.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.068
HONEY, I'M ALMOST DONE.

04:28.135 --> 04:31.639
IT TOOK THE PIONEERS LESS TIME
TO BUILD THE REAL THING.

04:37.811 --> 04:38.779
HI, EVERYBODY.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.113
HI, HONEY.

04:40.180 --> 04:43.917
STEVE, DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
THAT WHEN THE DOOR'S CLOSED,

04:43.984 --> 04:46.554
WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP
UNWANTED PEOPLE OUT?

04:46.620 --> 04:48.789
OH, I'D BETTER
LOCK IT, THEN.

04:52.893 --> 04:55.496
HE'S SUCH
A THOUGHTFUL CHILD.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.499
THANKS, ESTELLE.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.201
LAURA'S
NOT HERE.

05:01.268 --> 05:04.338
WELL, ACTUALLY, IT WAS EDDIE
WHO ASKED ME TO STOP BY.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.173
YOU'RE KIDDING.

05:06.239 --> 05:07.675
I COULDN'T
BELIEVE IT EITHER.

05:07.741 --> 05:11.579
I GOT SO EXCITED, I ALMOST
STEPPED ON MY TARANTULA.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.713
EW!

05:12.780 --> 05:14.748
EDDIE'S IN
THE LIVING ROOM.

05:14.815 --> 05:19.920
THANKS. NICE DIORAMA, EXCEPT
FOR THAT PITIFUL LOG CABIN.

05:22.055 --> 05:25.526
JUDY, WHY DON'T YOU HAVE RACHEL
TAKE A SHOT AT IT.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.230
HI, EDDIE.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.299
URKEL, THANK GOODNESS
YOU'RE HERE.

05:32.366 --> 05:33.634
I COULDN'T BELIEVE
YOU CALLED ME.

05:33.701 --> 05:36.404
SO, WHAT ARE YOU UP FOR?
TV, PARCHEESI,

05:36.470 --> 05:39.407
A LITTLE MALE BONDING?

05:39.473 --> 05:41.409
STEVE, I NEED YOUR HELP.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.577
I'M FLUNKING ALGEBRA,
AND I NEED YOU TO TUTOR ME.

05:43.644 --> 05:46.113
WELL, THIS IS
MY BUSY SEASON.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.882
I'M TRYING TO TEACH
THE FOOTBALL TEAM FRACTIONS.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.454
STEVE, I'M DESPERATE.
IF YOU DON'T HELP ME,

05:53.521 --> 05:55.322
I CAN'T GO
TO THE PRINCE CONCERT.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.024
CHECK OUT THESE SEATS.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.493
THIRD ROW.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.895
WOW! YOU COULD
GET SWEATED ON.

06:03.431 --> 06:04.532
WILL YOU TUTOR ME?

06:04.598 --> 06:06.299
I'LL GIVE YOU
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.735
REALLY?

06:07.801 --> 06:10.571
MAYBE WE CAN WORK
SOMETHING OUT.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.344
WHAT'S THAT?

06:17.411 --> 06:20.347
STANDARDIZED URKEL
ELEMENTARY MATH EXAM.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.816
IT HELPS TO DETERMINE
HOW MUCH HELP YOU NEED.

06:24.317 --> 06:26.253
OKAY, FIRST QUESTION.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.121
WHAT DO YOU GET
WHEN YOU MULTIPLY

06:28.188 --> 06:31.158
A NEGATIVE
BY A NEGATIVE?

06:31.224 --> 06:32.826
A REALLY BIG NEGATIVE?

06:35.095 --> 06:36.430
UH-OH.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.100
SECOND QUESTION.

06:40.167 --> 06:43.604
3 TIMES X EQUALS 6.

06:43.671 --> 06:45.839
WHAT IS
THE VALUE OF X?

06:45.906 --> 06:47.407
I KNOW THIS ONE.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.677
IT'S EITHER A NUMBER
OR A LETTER.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.614
WHOA.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.586
THIS HAS NEVER
HAPPENED BEFORE.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.754
I DID GOOD, HUH?

07:00.821 --> 07:02.823
YOU DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT
ONTO THE CHART.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.159
STEVE, TUTOR ME.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.829
I'LL GIVE YOU
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.197
ANYTHING?

07:10.263 --> 07:12.733
NAME IT
AND IT'S YOURS.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.368
WE'LL JUST SAY
THAT YOU OWE ME A FAVOR.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.904
IN THE MEANTIME...

07:16.970 --> 07:20.974
I'LL JUST TAKE THESE
AS COLLATERAL.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.915
I WOULD LIKE
TO PROPOSE A TOAST

07:27.981 --> 07:30.317
TO THE MOST BRILLIANT
CHILDREN IN CHICAGO.

07:30.383 --> 07:31.885
YOU ALL DID GREAT
ON YOUR MIDTERMS.

07:31.952 --> 07:35.122
WE'RE PROUD OF YOU.
HERE, HERE.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.690
JUDY'S TEACHER SAID

07:36.757 --> 07:39.727
SHE MADE THE BEST COVERED WAGON
IN THE WHOLE CLASS.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.496
REALLY? WHAT DID SHE LIKE
THINK OF MY LOG CABIN?

07:42.563 --> 07:43.831
SHE LOVED IT.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.600
I SET IT ON FIRE AND CALLED IT
AN INDIAN ATTACK.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.105
DAD, WHY DON'T
YOU SIT DOWN?

07:52.172 --> 07:54.107
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
HAVE A CHAIR, THAT'S WHY.

07:56.443 --> 07:59.079
CARL, HOW'S YOUR CHAIR
COMING ALONG?

07:59.146 --> 08:00.180
JUST GREAT, MAMA.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.215
WITH ANY LUCK, I'LL
BE SITTING BY BREAKFAST.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.320
[SNIFFING]

08:07.387 --> 08:09.356
HI, EVERYBODY.
HI, HONEY.

08:09.422 --> 08:11.925
HI, LAURA,
MY SWEET.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.927
MMM. STEAK.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.697
YOU EVER BEEN DOWN
TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE?

08:17.765 --> 08:19.399
IT'S FASCINATING.

08:19.466 --> 08:21.401
ONE MINUTE, MOO.

08:21.468 --> 08:23.704
THE NEXT MINUTE,
RUMP ROAST.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.575
HE'S SUCH
A WELL-ROUNDED CHILD.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.410
EDDIE, COULD WE
SPEAK PRIVATELY?

08:30.477 --> 08:31.712
SURE, URK.

08:31.779 --> 08:34.414
EXCUSE US
FOR A MINUTE.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.016
COME ON, OLD BUDDY.

08:41.589 --> 08:44.725
I GOT A "B."
HIGH!

08:48.729 --> 08:50.898
CONGRATULATIONS.
THAT'S GREAT.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.166
WONDERFUL. NOW
ABOUT MY PAYMENT...

08:53.233 --> 08:57.370
ANYTHING, URK, ANYTHING
IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.

08:57.437 --> 08:59.372
I WANT A DATE
WITH LAURA.

08:59.439 --> 09:01.942
WHAT'S YOUR
SECOND CHOICE?

09:02.009 --> 09:04.277
THERE IS
NO SECOND CHOICE.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.346
BUT, URKSTER,
BE REASONABLE.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.215
I WANT LAURA...

09:08.281 --> 09:10.017
ON A DATE...

09:10.083 --> 09:11.819
THIS FRIDAY NIGHT.

09:20.027 --> 09:23.196
LAURA, I'VE
BEEN THINKING.

09:23.263 --> 09:27.234
YOU KNOW WHO'S REALLY A GREAT
GUY ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW HIM?

09:27.300 --> 09:29.569
STEVE URKEL.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.405
URKEL?

09:32.472 --> 09:33.907
YEAH.

09:33.974 --> 09:37.144
YOU TWO KIDS REALLY
HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.311
IF I BELIEVED THAT,

09:38.378 --> 09:40.180
THERE'D BE
NO REASON TO GO ON.

09:42.650 --> 09:43.684
LAURA...

09:43.751 --> 09:45.686
STEVE WAS
A GREAT TUTOR.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.387
NOW I OWE HIM BIG.

09:47.454 --> 09:50.023
HOW BIG?

09:50.090 --> 09:52.459
I PROMISED HIM
A DATE WITH YOU.

09:52.525 --> 09:53.927
REALLY?

09:57.397 --> 10:00.734
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR MIND?

10:00.801 --> 10:02.435
HAVE A HEART.

10:02.502 --> 10:04.872
A COUPLE OF MEASLY HOURS
OF YOUR TIME

10:04.938 --> 10:06.306
COULD MAKE HIS
DREAMS COME TRUE.

10:06.373 --> 10:09.309
AND GIVE ME NIGHTMARES
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

10:10.410 --> 10:11.945
I CAN'T GO BACK
ON MY WORD.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.682
YOU SHOULD'VE PROMISED HIM
SOMETHING YOU COULD DELIVER,

10:14.748 --> 10:16.717
LIKE A RIDE
ON A SPACE SHUTTLE.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.820
LAURA...

10:19.887 --> 10:22.222
LAURA, LISTEN TO ME,
PLEASE.

10:29.496 --> 10:30.931
IT'S FINISHED.

10:30.998 --> 10:34.034
I TOOK THIS BABY APART
AND RE-GLUED EVERY JOINT,

10:34.101 --> 10:37.204
AND NOW THIS CHAIR
IS PERFECT.

10:41.008 --> 10:44.011
YEAH. NOW
IT'S A RECLINER.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.116
CAN I ASK YOU GUYS
A QUES--

10:52.753 --> 10:55.088
CAN I ASK YOU GUYS
A QUESTION?

10:55.155 --> 10:56.890
DID YOU EVER GO OUT
WITH SOMEONE

10:56.957 --> 10:58.792
JUST BECAUSE YOU FELT
SORRY FOR THEM?

10:58.859 --> 11:02.963
SURE. HOW DO YOU THINK
I MET YOUR DAD?

11:03.030 --> 11:07.100
HARRIETTE, DON'T START WITH ME.
I'M HAVING A REAL BAD WEEK.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.569
MY WORST DATE WAS
A CHICKEN FARMER.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.004
LUCAS HOBBS.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.073
HE WAS
THE MOST PATHETIC MAN.

11:13.140 --> 11:15.275
ALWAYS COVERED
WITH FEATHERS.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.510
WHY DID YOU DATE HIM?

11:17.577 --> 11:20.147
IT WAS THE DEPRESSION.
I NEEDED A GOOD MEAL.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.285
ONCE HE GOT ME
IN THE RUMBLE SEAT,

11:25.352 --> 11:27.320
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHETHER TO KISS HIM

11:27.387 --> 11:29.056
OR PLUCK HIM.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.359
HARRIETTE, REMEMBER
WHEN I WENT OUT

11:32.425 --> 11:34.762
WITH CLARENCE BIBBY?

11:34.828 --> 11:36.229
DO I EVER.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.531
EVERYTHING THAT BOY
EVER ATE IN HIS LIFE

11:38.598 --> 11:40.400
WAS STUCK
TO HIS HUSH PUPPIES.

11:40.467 --> 11:42.635
RACHEL, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'RE
THE HUSH PUPPY TYPE?

11:42.702 --> 11:44.337
OH, IT WAS A MERCY DATE.

11:44.404 --> 11:48.809
HE WAS HOPELESSLY IN LOVE
WITH ME. ONE OF MANY.

11:48.876 --> 11:52.645
SO LAURA, HONEY, WHO'S THE LOSER
IN YOUR LIFE?

11:52.712 --> 11:54.147
NAMES AREN'T IMPORTANT.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.449
LET'S JUST SAY HE'S
A WORLD-CLASS NERD

11:56.516 --> 11:58.418
WITH NO REDEEMING
QUALITIES.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.120
SOUNDS LIKE STEVE URKEL.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.323
IT IS.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.926
OOH.
OOH.

12:05.993 --> 12:09.329
THAT'S NOT A MERCY DATE.
THAT'S A LORD-HAVE-MERCY DATE.

12:09.396 --> 12:12.632
MERCY DATE?
STEVE IS A FINE YOUNG MAN.

12:12.699 --> 12:14.167
IF I WAS A FEW YEARS YOUNGER,

12:14.234 --> 12:16.904
I'D GIVE YOU A RUN
FOR YOUR MONEY.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.106
YOU WANT
A HEAD START?

12:30.250 --> 12:34.187
SO EDDIE, WHAT TIME SHOULD I
PICK UP LAURA FRIDAY NIGHT?

12:34.254 --> 12:37.891
URKMAN. I WAS JUST
GOING TO CALL YOU.

12:38.826 --> 12:42.362
LAURA SAID NO.

12:42.429 --> 12:46.934
HMM...WHO SHOULD I TAKE
TO THE PRINCE CONCERT?

12:47.000 --> 12:49.169
ONE OF THE GUYS
FROM THE CHESS CLUB?

12:49.236 --> 12:52.072
OR DR. WOO,
MY ALLERGIST?

12:54.507 --> 12:55.708
HI, STEVE.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.278
HI, LAURA.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.180
I DON'T SUPPOSE
I COULD PERSUADE YOU

13:00.247 --> 13:03.416
TO CHANGE YOUR MIND
ABOUT FRIDAY NIGHT.

13:03.483 --> 13:07.387
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SAYING THIS, BUT...

13:07.454 --> 13:09.022
I'LL--

13:12.292 --> 13:15.695
I'LL GO WITH YOU.

13:15.762 --> 13:18.866
WOW! THIS NEW COLOGNE
MUST REALLY WORK.

13:21.068 --> 13:24.637
LAURA, YOU'RE THE BRAVEST SISTER
A GUY EVER HAD.

13:24.704 --> 13:27.307
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.
YOU WON'T BE SORRY, LAURA.

13:27.374 --> 13:30.944
I HAVE A SPECTACULAR
EVENING PLANNED.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.745
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE

13:32.812 --> 13:34.814
UNTIL THE GROUND RULES
ARE STRAIGHT.

13:34.882 --> 13:37.350
FIRST OF ALL,
THIS IS NOT A REAL DATE.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.186
IT'S A NONDATE.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.421
SECOND, NO ONE
MUST EVER KNOW

13:41.488 --> 13:43.456
ABOUT THIS NONDATE.

13:44.925 --> 13:48.428
THIRD, IF YOU TOUCH ME
AT ANY TIME,

13:48.495 --> 13:50.597
THE NONDATE IS OVER.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.799
WHAT IF YOU TRIP
OR SOMETHING?

13:52.866 --> 13:55.568
JUST LET ME FALL.

13:55.635 --> 13:58.838
THE REST OF THE RULES ARE
COVERED IN THIS CONTRACT.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.840
"NO MOUTH BREATHING,

14:00.908 --> 14:02.542
"NO SNORTING,

14:02.609 --> 14:03.911
NO DROOLING--"

14:03.977 --> 14:07.447
WHO DOES THESE THINGS?
THEY'RE DISGUSTING.

14:08.748 --> 14:10.117
WHERE DO I SIGN?

14:25.732 --> 14:29.469
CARL, IT'S TAKING YOU FOREVER
TO FINISH THAT CHAIR.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.872
HARRIETTE, DO YOU WANT THIS FAST
OR DO YOU WANT IT GOOD?

14:32.940 --> 14:36.109
I DON'T THINK HE'S
GOT A SHOT EITHER WAY.

14:40.847 --> 14:43.650
LAURA...

14:43.716 --> 14:45.618
LAURA.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.354
DARN, YOU RECOGNIZED ME.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.890
WELL, IT WAS EITHER YOU
OR THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA!

14:57.264 --> 14:59.666
HI, EVERYBODY.
HI, HONEY.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.735
HI, LAURA,
MY SWEET.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.904
YOU LOOK RADIANT.

15:04.972 --> 15:06.273
THESE ARE FOR YOU.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.511
OHH.

15:13.180 --> 15:15.382
OHH.

15:15.448 --> 15:18.085
OH, AND I GOT NOUGAT
ON MY SHOE.

15:21.488 --> 15:22.822
OH, NO PROBLEM.

15:22.889 --> 15:26.093
I'LL JUST WIPE IT
OFF ON THE CURB.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.728
READY, MY SWEET?
OUR LIMO AWAITS.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.663
YOU RENTED A LIMO?

15:30.730 --> 15:34.167
NO. WELL, ACTUALLY IT'S
MY UNCLE ERNIE'S HEARSE.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.371
HE'S GONNA DRIVE
US TONIGHT.

15:38.438 --> 15:42.242
WE ONLY HAVE TO MAKE
ONE QUICK DELIVERY.

15:45.812 --> 15:48.181
LET'S GET THIS
OVER WITH.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.184
GOODNIGHT,
EVERYBODY.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.524
EXCUSE ME.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.990
DR. AND MRS. URKEL.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.794
JUST PRACTICING.

16:34.861 --> 16:36.429
AH, YES.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.232
MONSIEUR URKEL.
RIGHT THIS WAY, PLEASE.

16:39.299 --> 16:42.102
DON'T PUT US NEAR THE KITCHEN
OR BATHROOM, OKAY?

16:42.169 --> 16:44.337
OUI, MONSIEUR URKEL.

16:44.404 --> 16:48.608
I HATE THE SOUND
OF FLUSHING WHILE I'M EATING.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.578
DON'T YOU, MY PET?

16:55.482 --> 16:57.650
EXCUSEZ MOI.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.588
WHOOP!

17:07.227 --> 17:09.562
MADEMOISELLE.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.064
MONSIEUR.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.565
BON APPETIT.

17:15.968 --> 17:18.138
NERD ALERT.
TABLE 12.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.509
THIS PLACE IS PERFECT. NOBODY
WE KNOW WOULD EVER COME HERE.

17:22.575 --> 17:26.079
RIGHT. IT WILL BE
OUR SPECIAL PLACE.

17:27.814 --> 17:28.981
MADEMOISELLE.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.417
NO. WE WON'T BE
NEEDING THOSE.

17:30.483 --> 17:34.154
I ORDERED AHEAD FOR THE
SPECIALTY OF THE MAISON.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.089
AH, YES.

17:36.156 --> 17:37.657
CUISSE DES GRENOUILLES.

17:37.724 --> 17:38.825
EXCELLENT CHOICE.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.496
STEVE, WHAT DID YOU
JUST ORDER US?

17:43.563 --> 17:45.965
FROG LEGS.

17:46.032 --> 17:48.735
ARE YOU OKAY?

17:48.801 --> 17:49.769
AAH!

17:52.071 --> 17:53.706
WATCH IT!

17:55.575 --> 17:59.078
I HOPE THEIR FOOD IS BETTER
THAN THEIR SERVICE.

18:12.024 --> 18:16.329
BOY, DO THESE GUYS KNOW HOW
TO SAUTE THEIR AMPHIBIANS.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.400
HOW ABOUT SOME DESSERT?
NO, THANK YOU.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.135
EVERYTIME WE ORDER
ANOTHER COURSE,

18:22.202 --> 18:24.204
YOU BRING
YOUR CHAIR CLOSER.

18:24.271 --> 18:26.173
I CAN'T HELP IT, LAURA.

18:26.239 --> 18:29.609
I'M DRAWN TO YOU
LIKE A MOTH TO A FLAME,

18:29.676 --> 18:31.578
A BEE TO A BLOSSOM,

18:31.644 --> 18:34.314
A MOUSE TO CHEESE.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.817
CHECK, PLEASE.

18:40.387 --> 18:43.356
LAURA, YOU'RE
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL

18:43.423 --> 18:44.891
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.296
AND I'M THE LUCKIEST GUY.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.733
I ONLY HOPE THIS EVENING

18:53.800 --> 18:57.404
HAS BEEN AS MAGICAL FOR YOU
AS IT'S BEEN FOR ME.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.273
WELL...

19:02.141 --> 19:04.311
IT HASN'T
BEEN THAT BAD.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.347
ONLY ONE MORE THING

19:07.414 --> 19:10.850
COULD MAKE THIS NIGHT
EVEN MORE SPECIAL.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.419
I WAS JUST HOPING--

19:12.485 --> 19:15.455
WELL, IF IT'S NOT
TOO MUCH TROUBLE,

19:15.522 --> 19:19.292
I COULD HAVE ONE SMALL KISS
ON THE CHEEK.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.430
THAT WOULD
INVOLVE TOUCHING,

19:23.496 --> 19:25.298
WHICH WOULD BE
A CLEAR VIOLATION

19:25.365 --> 19:26.633
OF OUR CONTRACT.

19:26.699 --> 19:30.470
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

19:30.537 --> 19:31.838
WHY SHOULD YOU
LOWER YOURSELF

19:31.904 --> 19:35.107
JUST BECAUSE IT WOULD
MEAN THE WORLD TO ME?

19:35.174 --> 19:36.509
OH, URKEL.

19:37.744 --> 19:40.647
FOR YOU, IT'S JUST
AN INSIGNIFICANT GESTURE.

19:40.713 --> 19:44.284
IN YOUR LIFETIME, YOU'LL GO OUT
ON HUNDREDS OF DATES.

19:44.351 --> 19:47.720
BUT FOR ME, THIS COULD
BE MY ONE AND ONLY.

19:47.787 --> 19:51.591
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?
I'VE PEAKED AT 13.

19:55.662 --> 19:59.866
OKAY, URKEL.
ONE KISS ON THE CHEEK.

19:59.932 --> 20:03.503
KEEP YOUR HANDS ON THE TABLE
WHERE I CAN SEE THEM,

20:03.570 --> 20:06.339
DON'T MOVE YOUR HEAD,
AND NO PUCKERING.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.282
THANKS,
UNCLE ERNIE!

20:18.050 --> 20:19.619
URKEL!

20:19.686 --> 20:22.088
THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE
CONTRACT ABOUT PICTURES.

20:22.154 --> 20:25.958
NOW WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE MEMENTO
OF OUR NIGHT TOGETHER.

20:26.025 --> 20:29.095
THAT'S IT.
THIS NONDATE IS OVER!

20:29.161 --> 20:31.598
OH, BUT, LAURA,
MY SWEETS--

20:38.305 --> 20:40.440
BONJOUR.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.338
WILL SOMEBODY HAND ME SOME
MARSHMALLOWS, PLEASE?

21:22.349 --> 21:25.084
CARL, I HATE TO SAY
I TOLD YOU SO--

21:25.151 --> 21:26.686
THEN, DON'T.

21:29.489 --> 21:32.124
HI, LAURA.
HOW'D IT GO?

21:32.191 --> 21:34.661
IT WAS THE MOST
DISGUSTING...

21:38.398 --> 21:41.133
IT WAS THE MOST
DISGUSTING, DEGRADING,

21:41.200 --> 21:44.637
HUMILIATING NIGHT
OF MY LIFE.

21:44.704 --> 21:46.739
OH. HOW WAS
THE FOOD?

21:48.975 --> 21:51.277
LAURA, LOOK, I KNOW
YOU HAD A BAD NIGHT,

21:51.344 --> 21:54.013
BUT SOMEDAY YOU GONNA LOOK BACK
AT THIS NIGHT

21:54.080 --> 21:55.382
AND SEE HOW FUNNY IT IS.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.617
MAYBE FROM
WHERE YOU SIT, DAD.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.153
BUT RIGHT NOW

22:01.220 --> 22:03.823
ALL I CAN SEE IS URKEL RUNNING
OUT OF THE RESTAURANT

22:03.890 --> 22:06.393
WITH A TABLECLOTH
TUCKED INTO HIS PANTS.

22:07.794 --> 22:08.695
HE DID THAT?

22:08.761 --> 22:11.531
HE PRACTICALLY
LEVELED THE PLACE.

22:11.598 --> 22:14.467
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

22:14.534 --> 22:18.505
I GUESS
IT WAS PRETTY FUNNY.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.272
HERE ARE YOUR TICKETS.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.476
THANKS, LAURA.
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

22:23.543 --> 22:26.278
WHY DON'T YOU GO TO
THE CONCERT WITH ME?

22:26.345 --> 22:27.814
YOU MEAN THAT?

22:27.880 --> 22:29.949
IT'LL BE FUN.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.083
THANKS, EDDIE.

22:34.253 --> 22:36.489
LAURA, YOU DID
A NICE THING.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.057
WE'RE PROUD OF YOU.

22:38.124 --> 22:39.792
YEAH. NOW LOOK AT IT
THIS WAY.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.661
NOW THAT YOU'VE
GONE OUT WITH STEVE,

22:41.728 --> 22:44.030
HE'LL PROBABLY LEAVE
YOU ALONE FOR A WHILE.

22:44.096 --> 22:45.798
[RING]

22:47.099 --> 22:49.035
[RING]

22:50.403 --> 22:51.337
HELLO?

22:51.404 --> 22:53.473
HI, CARL,
THIS IS STEVE!

22:56.876 --> 22:58.811
YOU'VE REACHED
THE WINSLOW RESIDENCE.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.880
THERE'S NO ONE HOME RIGHT NOW.
SO PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE

23:00.947 --> 23:03.516
AT THE SOUND
OF THE BEEP. BEEP!

23:04.651 --> 23:07.854
LAURA, THANK YOU
FOR OUR ENCHANTED EVENING.

23:07.920 --> 23:12.625
MY CHEEK IS STILL ON FIRE
FROM YOUR KISS.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.427
AND NOW THAT
WE'RE A COUPLE,

23:14.494 --> 23:17.597
I WAS HOPING YOU'D WEAR
MY MEDICAL I.D. BRACELET.

23:17.664 --> 23:21.434
THE CHESS CLUB'S HAVING
A WEENIE ROAST THIS WEEKEND,

23:21.501 --> 23:23.436
I PUT US DOWN FOR TWO.
