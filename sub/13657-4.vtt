Thank god.
This jet lag is killing me.

00:15.249 --> 00:17.916
Yeah, the flight from phoenix

on the ground.

00:25.693 --> 00:26.892
Too much sodium.

00:26.894 --> 00:28.460
You sure?
'cause I took like 30 bags

wasn't watching.

In the part of town

If it's not up to
your usual standards,

00:47.448 --> 00:50.249
Maybe we can get the d.A.
To revoke your deal.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.451
Yeah, and then instead of
testifying tomorrow,

00:52.453 --> 00:55.888
You can spend the next 20 years
in a state facility.

00:55.890 --> 00:58.757
No, I'm not complaining, guys.
You've both been awesome.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.526
First time I've ridden
in a police car

Without my hands cuffed
behind my back.

You don't make
any other calls,

You don't leave this room,
and you don't open the door.

To pick you up.

four weeks back, I fainted.

About all the money
nicole's wedding is costing.

I'm arguing with my ex-wife,

And the next minute,
I wake up in an ambulance

With some guy asking me
who the president is.

Unless you want

because...?
Nothing.

High blood pressure.

The doctor wants to put me
on this pill,

02:30.451 --> 02:33.485
But the side effects
could make me irritable, moody,

of first-degree murder.

let this happen?

We were doing you a favor!
This is not even our case!

told to pick the creep up
at the airport,

My chances of a conviction
are zero.

And who exactly
is scott perry?

Stealing moving vans
and fencing their contents.

08:09.623 --> 08:12.824
They had a dispute over money.
Scott perry shot dennis tucker.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.327
His other friend, lloyd gibbs,
witnessed the murder

08:15.329 --> 08:17.028
And agreed to testify.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.097
Couldn't you have just made
a deal with mr. Perry?

08:19.099 --> 08:21.166
We believe scott perry
was paid to kill his friend

08:21.168 --> 08:24.302
By someone more powerful,
most likely his fence,

08:24.304 --> 08:26.972
And there's no deal
unless perry gives the guy up.

over here.

to a police station before.

08:36.717 --> 08:37.816
Wow.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.986
It's just all
so interesting.

08:40.988 --> 08:43.121
Oh, buzz,
this is my friend kris.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.723
Kris, this is buzz.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.259
<i>You're</i> kris?
I thought you were...

08:48.728 --> 08:50.695
I mean, it's so nice
to meet you.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.264
You too.

08:52.266 --> 08:54.366
What a cool place to study.
How many people work here?

08:54.368 --> 08:56.334
About half.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.703
Here's
your math problems back.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.739
I marked the ones
you might want to rethink.

09:00.741 --> 09:01.773
Thanks.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.742
You can sit here.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.045
Sharon:
I understand your frustration,

09:07.047 --> 09:08.980
But until we have orders
to the contrary,

09:08.982 --> 09:11.416
L.A.P.D. Officers
are not required

09:11.418 --> 09:13.084
To babysit
your witnesses.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.086
Emma: Unless they're cute,
little blond boys,

09:15.088 --> 09:17.155
In which case,
you adopt them?

09:17.157 --> 09:19.824
Look, I can't put lloyd gibbs
on the stand

09:19.826 --> 09:22.827
Unless he's cleared
of this murder -- immediately.

09:22.829 --> 09:24.963
Lieutenant tao
has just returned

09:24.965 --> 09:28.867
With evidence from
the crime scene at
the convenience store.

09:28.869 --> 09:31.436
I will be out there momentarily
to examine it. Thank you.

09:36.442 --> 09:37.776
Ah, ah.

09:38.778 --> 09:40.979
Sit.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.847
Captain...

09:42.849 --> 09:45.317
We were never informed that
lloyd gibbs could be dangerous,

09:45.319 --> 09:47.252
And he was unarmed
when we picked him up.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.788
And you searched him
for weapons?

09:49.790 --> 09:51.723
The dirtbag
was getting off a plane!

09:51.725 --> 09:53.391
That's the tsa's job!

09:53.393 --> 09:55.393
I'm almost certain
that this whole thing

09:55.395 --> 09:57.228
Is just one big
misunderstanding,

09:57.230 --> 09:59.064
And we'll sort it out
in no time.

09:59.066 --> 10:02.200
Tao:
The evidence shows lloyd gibbs
robbed the convenience store

10:02.202 --> 10:04.002
After shooting the owner
to death.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.004
And what makes you
so sure of that?

10:06.006 --> 10:07.906
The time line
we put together.

10:09.175 --> 10:11.943
Sykes: Louis berg,
owner of easy time market.

10:11.945 --> 10:15.180
At 1:16 a.M. -- Standing
in the middle of his store.

10:15.182 --> 10:17.449
Mr. Berg was shot twice
in the chest.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.050
As you can see,
his blood covers

10:19.052 --> 10:21.152
About a 4-foot radius
on the floor.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.154
Lloyd gibbs' sneakers.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.589
See the tread?

10:25.758 --> 10:29.427
Gibbs walked through the blood
to the counter,

10:29.429 --> 10:33.331
And then he tracked prints
to the door and beyond.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.433
Is there any video
from inside the market?

10:35.435 --> 10:38.937
There were cameras in the store,
but nothing was being recorded.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.338
Aha!

10:40.340 --> 10:42.107
So no incriminating footage
from the scene.

10:42.109 --> 10:45.477
But we did catch some video
from an atm 20 yards away.

10:45.479 --> 10:47.312
I've blown it up.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.981
That's lloyd gibbs
jumping up and down in a puddle.

10:50.916 --> 10:53.985
Trying, I think,
to get blood off his sneakers.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.321
Buzz, can you freeze-frame?

10:56.323 --> 10:57.889
Thanks.

10:57.891 --> 11:00.392
Underneath his right arm --
two six-packs of beer.

11:00.394 --> 11:01.860
Underneath his left arm --

11:01.862 --> 11:04.095
A bag stamped
"easy time market."

11:04.097 --> 11:07.065
Other security cameras captured
his run back to the motel,

11:07.067 --> 11:08.266
Culminating at 3:10 a.M.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.968
With this video of gibbs

11:09.970 --> 11:11.870
Staggering through
the parking lot

11:11.872 --> 11:12.837
Towards his room.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.005
Oh, my god.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.840
Tao:
This footage is consistent

11:15.842 --> 11:18.109
With all the 911 calls
from various people

11:18.111 --> 11:21.946
Reporting someone matching
our suspect's description
returning to the motel.

11:21.948 --> 11:24.015
Emma: I've got 15 minutes
to get to court

11:24.017 --> 11:25.884
And persuade the judge
that lloyd gibbs

11:25.886 --> 11:27.952
Is a credible witness
being unfairly detained.

11:27.954 --> 11:30.155
Anybody care
to come back me up?

11:30.157 --> 11:31.289
I will.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.224
This evidence
is total bullshit.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.592
Emma: Thank you.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.494
Nice to know I have
at least one friend here,

11:36.496 --> 11:38.129
Detective lopez.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.531
[ chuckles ]

11:41.867 --> 11:43.868
Oh, that's so sad.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.371
I know --
the poor shopkeeper's family.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.373
No, I mean that
detective sanchez has a crush

11:48.375 --> 11:49.841
On that horrible emma lady,

11:49.843 --> 11:51.309
And she doesn't
even know his name.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.244
Uh-huh.
Thank you.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.412
That was ballistics.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.114
The .45 found
in lloyd's room

11:56.116 --> 11:58.583
Not only matches the bullets
that killed louis berg --

11:58.585 --> 12:00.452
It's also
the missing murder weapon

12:00.454 --> 12:01.586
From dda rios' trial.

12:03.923 --> 12:05.857
I think
her material witness

12:05.859 --> 12:08.159
May end up becoming
her new defendant.

12:19.972 --> 12:21.272
Emma: Ii'll be opensclose
to charges of misconduct.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.907
Don't worry.
I got your back.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.009
Judge richwood:
Let's call the court to order.

12:25.011 --> 12:27.412
Your honor, one moment
before you bring in the jury.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.281
I have a...
A little emergency.

12:30.283 --> 12:33.351
[ sighs ]
will counsel please approach?

12:34.186 --> 12:36.955
Detective lopez.

12:39.024 --> 12:41.292
All right,
what's the problem, ms. Rios?

12:41.294 --> 12:44.062
Because of threats to the life
of the people's witness,

12:44.064 --> 12:45.930
The l.A.P.D. Has taken
lloyd gibbs

12:45.932 --> 12:47.298
Into protective custody, sir.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.501
He's temporarily unavailable
to testify.

12:49.503 --> 12:51.970
I'm sorry.
You are?

12:51.972 --> 12:55.507
Detective julio sanchez.
Major crimes.

12:55.509 --> 12:58.576
Dda rios insisted that mr. Gibbs
be allowed to appear,

12:58.578 --> 13:00.478
But in our opinion,
it's not safe.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.981
Your honor, I find
this explanation ridiculous.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.283
Your honor, mr. Gibbs
is being held by the police.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.185
And he is being protected.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.653
Dillard:
Your honor, 10 minutes ago,
I heard a news report

13:08.655 --> 13:10.655
That a man
sounding like lloyd gibbs

13:10.657 --> 13:12.056
Was arrested for murder

13:12.058 --> 13:13.491
Tragically similar to the one

13:13.493 --> 13:15.460
My client is on trial for
at this very moment.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.962
Your honor, the l.A.P.D.
Is not run by reporters,

13:17.964 --> 13:20.231
And our concerns about mr. Gibbs
are legitimate.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.600
[ inhales deeply ]
ms. Rios...

13:22.602 --> 13:24.435
Look, I don't mind
an afternoon off

13:24.437 --> 13:25.670
Or a late morning tomorrow,

13:25.672 --> 13:28.606
But the jury can't stay here
indefinitely.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.275
I'll grant
a 24-hour continuance,

13:30.277 --> 13:32.677
At which time
trial will resume

13:32.679 --> 13:34.445
With your witness or without.

13:34.447 --> 13:35.547
Is that clear?

13:35.549 --> 13:37.115
Yes, your honor.
Thank you.

13:39.084 --> 13:42.587
Wow, you completely
misrepresented what's going on.

13:42.589 --> 13:44.222
It's too soon to say.

13:44.224 --> 13:47.125
Maybe lloyd
wasn't even in that store.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.693
Hell yeah,
I was in the store.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.161
But you didn't
rob the place?

13:50.163 --> 13:53.031
Uh, did I <i>rob</i> it?
Um...

13:53.033 --> 13:55.133
Well, why do you even need
to think about it?

13:55.135 --> 13:57.168
Either you robbed the place
or you didn't.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.670
I-it's not a simple
yes-or-no answer.

13:58.672 --> 14:01.506
Okay, the cashier
was lying on the floor, dead.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.575
I mean [laughs]
what was I gonna do --

14:03.577 --> 14:06.277
Throw a 20 on him and say,
"here you go, dead guy"?

14:06.279 --> 14:08.046
"that's for the beer.
Keep the change."

14:08.048 --> 14:10.515
Had you ever seen
the shopkeeper before?

14:10.517 --> 14:12.450
I don't think so.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.186
I mean, does this look like
anyone you know?

14:15.188 --> 14:16.588
Oh, very funny, lloyd.

14:16.590 --> 14:18.990
<i>We're asking you</i>
<i>serious questions here.</i>

14:18.992 --> 14:20.291
<i>Well, and I'm giving you</i>
<i>serious answers.</i>

14:20.293 --> 14:22.026
<i>[ stammers ]</i>
<i>as far as I know,</i>

14:22.028 --> 14:24.395
<i>I'd never seen the guy before,</i>
<i>and even if I had,</i>

14:24.397 --> 14:26.664
<i>I definitely</i>
<i>would not have recognized him</i>

14:26.666 --> 14:28.466
<i>Given the way</i>
<i>he looked then.</i>

14:28.468 --> 14:30.568
<i>And by that, I mean given</i>
<i>that he was dead.</i>

14:30.570 --> 14:32.070
Sykes:
Great news, captain.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.038
Turns out louis berg,
our dead shopkeeper,

14:34.040 --> 14:35.340
Was a total sleazebag.

14:35.342 --> 14:36.708
A lot of people
could've wanted him dead.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.409
Really?
No question.
And that market --

14:38.411 --> 14:41.045
It was mostly a front
for his gambling operation.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.513
Louis berg was a bookie.

14:42.515 --> 14:45.183
Which explains why the cameras
weren't recording.

14:45.185 --> 14:48.052
Detective sykes,
see if you can make a list

14:48.054 --> 14:50.288
Of mr. Berg's
gambling clientele.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.623
Thank you.

14:51.625 --> 14:53.157
<i>[ clears throat ]</i>
<i>uh, all right.</i>

14:53.159 --> 14:54.425
Provenza:
All right, lloyd, look at me.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.294
Now listen.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.329
Do you understand
that you could go to prison

14:58.331 --> 14:59.631
For the rest of your life?

14:59.633 --> 15:02.433
Okay, how dumb
do you guys think I am?

15:02.435 --> 15:05.370
No one gets life in prison
for stealing beer.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.338
<i>Not even</i>
<i>really good beer.</i>

15:07.340 --> 15:11.643
<i>For murder, lloyd!</i>
<i>You'll go to prison for murder!</i>

15:11.645 --> 15:14.612
In 30 years, I've never seen
a better case against anybody.

15:14.614 --> 15:15.713
Flynn: You know what?
The hell with it.

15:15.715 --> 15:17.448
I'm gonna arrest him now.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.583
Okay, w-wait!
Look.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.717
[ sighs ]

15:19.719 --> 15:22.253
A friend was with me
last night.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.188
<i>I told you</i>
<i>not to call anybody!</i>

15:24.190 --> 15:25.657
<i>It wasn't just anybody!</i>

15:25.659 --> 15:29.227
This is the most amazing woman
in the world.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.329
I've known her
since we were kids.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.298
We've dated off and on
since high school,

15:33.300 --> 15:34.399
And you can believe <i>her</i>

15:34.401 --> 15:36.100
When she says
I didn't kill anyone

15:36.102 --> 15:38.636
Because she is honest,
dependable,

15:38.638 --> 15:41.639
And absolutely
<i>not</i> a prostitute.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.374
"not a prostitute."

15:45.744 --> 15:48.746
What is her name?

15:48.748 --> 15:50.782
Her name is "shampagne."

15:52.084 --> 15:53.217
With an "s."

15:54.153 --> 15:55.520
And she has a website.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.094
[ sighs ]

16:03.096 --> 16:05.396
In the entire history
of crime,

16:05.398 --> 16:09.734
There has never been a reliable
alibi witness named shampagne.

16:09.736 --> 16:12.570
I am so sorry.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.372
I would have introduced myself
sooner,

16:14.374 --> 16:15.506
But it's been so busy here.

16:15.508 --> 16:16.541
You must be kris.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.643
Sharon, kris.

16:18.645 --> 16:22.146
This is my own personal
police captain.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.848
Kris: Oh, well,
it's so nice to meet you.

16:23.850 --> 16:26.117
Thanks for letting me come
and watch today.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.219
I was just telling kris
that this is an easy one

16:28.221 --> 16:30.254
Because you guys
already caught the murderer.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.289
Lloyd: No, they didn't!

16:31.291 --> 16:32.824
I didn't kill anyone!

16:32.826 --> 16:35.426
Um...

16:35.428 --> 16:39.197
I hope your parents
don't mind you being here.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.566
Oh, no. My parents
don't care where I am.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.134
Really?

16:43.136 --> 16:45.403
Uh, that's how much
they trust her.

16:46.338 --> 16:49.207
Captain, we found
the alibi witness.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.875
Excuse me.

not a problem --

19:11.317 --> 19:14.585
Though as long as you know
it's twice the price.

Also, I have to charge
for the time it takes

Which is why I really don't want
to tell you about last night...

U-unless I have to.
Do I have to?

20:42.709 --> 20:44.642
I'd say it's
in your best interest.

Okay, fine.

Who has always had
the biggest crush on me.

with a big bouquet of flowers.

Last night.
Just concentrate
on last night.

20:59.826 --> 21:02.693
Oh, uh, lloyd texted
and said he was in town,

21:02.695 --> 21:04.528
And did
I want to come over?

21:04.530 --> 21:07.164
Only when I got there,
he didn't have any beer.

21:07.166 --> 21:09.900
I had no idea
he'd be so unready to entertain,

21:09.902 --> 21:12.036
So I drove him
to the nearby market

21:12.038 --> 21:14.405
And waited outside
while he went in,

21:14.407 --> 21:15.706
And, uh...

21:15.708 --> 21:17.408
There were gunshots.

21:17.410 --> 21:20.444
So, you just
left him there?

21:20.446 --> 21:22.813

if he was all right,

from being charged with murder,

how hard it is to kick heroin.

why we haven't arrested him yet

Isn't that the number

35:43.942 --> 35:45.275
I'll take the deal.

35:45.277 --> 35:46.877
You made
the right choice.

35:46.879 --> 35:49.546
Good. I'll write up
your statement of facts.

35:49.548 --> 35:52.582
You can sign it, and we'll
give it to judge richwood.

35:52.584 --> 35:53.884
And we'll all move on.
[ sighs ]

35:53.886 --> 35:56.953
Flynn:
Don't start with me, okay?!

35:56.955 --> 35:58.855
Hey, listen,
if you expect me to pay 30 grand

35:58.857 --> 36:01.291
Of my hard-earned money
for this wedding,

36:01.293 --> 36:03.460
I am walking her
down the aisle myself.

36:03.462 --> 36:04.861
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.830
Her stepfather hasn't
contributed a dime, okay?

36:06.832 --> 36:10.700
I'm gonna walk my little girl
to the altar alone.

36:10.702 --> 36:13.503
Flynn, be careful --
your blood pressure!
What? What the --

36:13.505 --> 36:15.972
You just told the entire world
that I have high blood pressure.

36:15.974 --> 36:17.507
Now everyone knows!

36:17.509 --> 36:18.608
They didn't hear me.

36:18.610 --> 36:19.609
Nobody heard me,
did they?

36:19.611 --> 36:20.744
I heard you!

36:20.746 --> 36:22.345
You said,
"high blood pressure."

36:22.347 --> 36:24.848
Explains a lot -- I mean,
not everything, but a lot.

36:24.850 --> 36:27.918
You see?
What did I ask you?
Just take it easy.

36:27.920 --> 36:29.719
Y-yank on your earlobe
or something.

36:29.721 --> 36:31.021
Don't tell me
to take it easy, okay?

36:31.023 --> 36:32.589
I asked you to do
one simple thing --

36:32.591 --> 36:34.457
Not tell anybody
about my blood pressure!

36:34.459 --> 36:36.459
What do you do?!
You tell the world!
It just slipped out!

36:36.461 --> 36:37.661
Oh, really?!
Really!

36:37.663 --> 36:38.795
Really?!
Really?!
Really.

36:41.332 --> 36:43.466
[ thud ]

36:43.468 --> 36:45.402
What's going on out there?

36:54.512 --> 36:56.079
Julio!

37:08.359 --> 37:09.492
<i>Rusty: Okay, uh,</i>
<i>just let me have it.</i>
<i>Shh.</i>
<i>What'd I miss?</i>  <i>Quiet.</i>

37:09.494 --> 37:10.694
<i>Kris: Nice try. No.</i>

37:10.696 --> 37:12.462
<i>Just think about it.</i>

37:12.464 --> 37:15.031
<i>That lieutenant provenza guy,</i>
<i>he's avuncular.</i>

37:15.033 --> 37:16.766
[ chuckles ]
means irresistible.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.501
[ laughs ]
look it up.

37:18.503 --> 37:21.037
<i>It's means, like,</i>
<i>kindly, like an uncle.</i>

37:21.039 --> 37:22.672
How's lieutenant flynn?

37:22.674 --> 37:25.642
Well, falling down
knocked some sense into him.

37:25.644 --> 37:27.978
He's starting the meds
he should've been on weeks ago.

37:27.980 --> 37:30.947
<i>Hey, so, um,</i>
<i>I was wondering...</i>
<i>Also, I told him if he didn't,</i>

37:30.949 --> 37:33.116
I'd put it in his files
and chain him to a desk.

37:33.118 --> 37:35.518
<i>...What is there to do in</i>
<i>los angeles over the weekend?</i>

37:35.520 --> 37:38.922
Oh, oh, oh.
Look at this.

37:38.924 --> 37:41.524
<i>I mean, if this were</i>
<i>san francisco or new york,</i>

37:41.526 --> 37:42.592
<i>I'd have a better idea,</i>

37:42.594 --> 37:45.695
But...
I don't know l.A.

37:45.697 --> 37:47.063
<i>Well, um...</i>

37:47.065 --> 37:50.934
<i>Well, this is</i>
<i>kind of different, but,</i>

37:50.936 --> 37:53.703
Um, there's a cemetery
<i>in hollywood</i>

37:53.705 --> 37:55.872
Where a lot of old actors
are buried,

37:55.874 --> 37:58.541
And during the summer,
they show movies there.

37:58.543 --> 38:00.610
Uh, somebody took me there...

38:00.612 --> 38:04.414
I mean,
I took somebody there once,

38:04.416 --> 38:06.850
And it was -- it was fun...

38:06.852 --> 38:09.019
F-for a little while.

38:09.021 --> 38:13.423
<i>Well, is there a chance</i>
<i>that maybe we could go?</i>

38:13.425 --> 38:16.026
Uh, oh, oh, kris, look,

38:16.028 --> 38:18.828
You may live in california,
but I live in a police state,

38:18.830 --> 38:22.565
And I can't go anywhere right
now without an l.A.P.D. Escort.

38:22.567 --> 38:25.135
<i>Maybe they wouldn't</i>
<i>mind coming.</i>

38:25.137 --> 38:27.604
Well, it's expensive --
overtime costs.

38:29.473 --> 38:32.709
But you know what?
I-I can ask.

38:32.711 --> 38:34.577
I mean, the worst thing
that can happen

38:34.579 --> 38:35.979
Is I could get a "no,"
right?

38:35.981 --> 38:37.580
Right.

38:37.582 --> 38:38.815
Right, okay.

38:38.817 --> 38:40.617
<i>All right,</i>
<i>well, I'll ask.</i>

38:40.619 --> 38:42.118
<i>[ laughing ] okay.</i>

38:42.120 --> 38:44.120
I'll be right back.

38:44.122 --> 38:46.523
Captain,
he's on his way out.

38:46.525 --> 38:47.791
He's gonna be --
oh.

38:53.197 --> 38:55.799
[ police radio chatter ]

38:58.135 --> 38:59.869
Oh, hi.

38:59.871 --> 39:01.471
Hey.
Hey.

39:01.473 --> 39:03.907
How's the studying going?

39:03.909 --> 39:05.008
It's fine.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.577
Um, I wanted
to ask you something.

39:07.579 --> 39:08.945
Is this a bad time?

39:08.947 --> 39:11.047
Oh, no, no,
it's, um, perfect.

39:11.049 --> 39:12.749
What?

39:12.751 --> 39:15.618
W-well, this last case
you've been working on,

39:15.620 --> 39:19.022
It's about discrediting
a material witness, right?

39:19.024 --> 39:20.657
Yes.

39:20.659 --> 39:22.225
Well, how'd that work out?

39:22.227 --> 39:24.260
Uh, well, uh,
in this case,

39:24.262 --> 39:27.097
The legal system
had an alternative. Why?

39:27.099 --> 39:28.998
I was just thinking about

39:29.000 --> 39:31.801
How serious
my situation really is.

39:31.803 --> 39:35.038
Oh, rusty, you're fine.
Don't worry about it.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.674
Is there, um...

39:37.676 --> 39:42.212
Anything else that, uh,
you'd like to ask me.

39:45.049 --> 39:46.049
No.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.651
No, not right now.
Uh...

39:50.121 --> 39:51.721
Thanks.

40:06.670 --> 40:08.638
Well, how'd it go?

40:08.640 --> 40:10.106
What happened?

40:10.108 --> 40:13.009
I'm not sure.

40:14.812 --> 40:16.846
Rusty: <i>Hey.</i>

40:16.848 --> 40:22.752
So [sighs] uh, this sucks,
<i>but she said no.</i>

40:22.754 --> 40:25.288
Kris: <i>Oh, well. Sorry.</i>

40:25.290 --> 40:27.123
Y-you said no?

40:27.125 --> 40:29.993
Just to keep me
out of your office?

40:29.995 --> 40:31.294
Lieutenant,
he never asked.

40:31.296 --> 40:34.230
<i>Safety first</i>
<i>around here, so...</i>

40:34.232 --> 40:35.965
Well...

40:35.967 --> 40:39.235
Maybe he's nervous.

40:39.237 --> 40:42.572
I don't think so.
<i>Lucky for us we still have</i>
<i>a lot of vocabulary cards</i>

40:42.574 --> 40:44.841
<i>To go through.</i>
<i>Right, that we do.</i>

40:44.843 --> 40:47.644
When my daughter
was rusty's age,

40:47.646 --> 40:51.147
She dated several boys
from her ballet school.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.249
It didn't go so well.

40:53.251 --> 40:54.984
<i>Okay, let's try obfuscate.</i>

40:54.986 --> 40:56.820
<i>Obfuscate.</i>

40:56.822 --> 40:59.322
[ sighs ]
<i>to make something</i>
<i>incomprehensible.</i>

40:59.324 --> 41:04.594
Anyway, I feel a month
of civility coming my way.

41:04.596 --> 41:05.628
Son of a --

41:05.630 --> 41:08.131
Ah.

41:09.733 --> 41:10.800
I mean...

41:10.802 --> 41:12.268
You're welcome.

41:12.270 --> 41:15.038
[ laughs ]

41:15.040 --> 41:17.607
<i>Correct again.</i>

41:17.609 --> 41:19.776
<i>Mendacious.</i>

41:19.778 --> 41:23.780
Misleading
or prone to lying.

41:23.782 --> 41:25.648
Mm-hmm.

41:25.650 --> 41:28.151
<i>All right, uh,</i>
<i>the next word is pariah.</i>

41:28.153 --> 41:30.019
Pariah -- an outcast.

41:30.021 --> 41:32.889
<i>His close friends</i>
<i>respected him,</i>

41:32.891 --> 41:32.922
But the rest of the world
viewed him as a pariah.
