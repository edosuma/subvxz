WEBVTT

00:09.167 --> 00:11.000
- No, you're doing it from here.

00:11.100 --> 00:12.433
It's up here, okay?
It's like, "I'm Jay Baruchel.

00:12.533 --> 00:14.433
"Uh, I don't know
how to fly a plane,

00:14.533 --> 00:16.500
but I can train your dragon."

00:16.600 --> 00:18.400
- Oh, big news.

00:18.500 --> 00:21.200
I'm assuming both of you ladies
know who Trick Malloy is.

00:21.300 --> 00:22.933
- Sounds like a bisexual
pool player.

00:23.033 --> 00:24.400
- Or an Irish magician.

00:24.500 --> 00:26.733
- He is a quarterback
and the MVP

00:26.833 --> 00:29.233
for the Conquistadors.

00:29.333 --> 00:32.067
Football team
I'm part owner of?

00:32.167 --> 00:35.400
Anyway, his contract
is almost up,

00:35.500 --> 00:37.700
and he's considering retiring.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.067
- Was Trick
short for Patrick?

00:39.167 --> 00:40.100
I love
last-half-of-the-name nicknames,

00:40.200 --> 00:42.233
like Topher, Xander...

00:42.333 --> 00:44.033
- Or Acob.
- Ladies, ladies,

00:44.133 --> 00:45.733
I've invited him here
for the weekend

00:45.833 --> 00:47.267
to clear his head.

00:47.367 --> 00:50.267
I convinced him
not to leave the team.

00:50.367 --> 00:52.100
Now, he has
a press conference on Monday.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.733
Ladies, I need you both

00:54.833 --> 00:57.233
on your best behavior,
all right?

00:57.333 --> 00:59.433
And be careful of this one.
He's a bit of a charmer.

00:59.533 --> 01:02.133
I'll try, but celebrities, uh,

01:02.233 --> 01:03.433
make me nervous.

01:03.533 --> 01:04.567
I'm an adorable...

01:04.667 --> 01:06.500
I'm an adorable Canadian.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.633
- That's good.

01:09.467 --> 01:11.667
- Dueling Jay Baruchel
impressions.

01:11.767 --> 01:13.567
- You both sound
like sick goats.

01:13.667 --> 01:15.367
both:
Perfect.

01:15.467 --> 01:17.367
- * We're too gangsta for TV

01:17.467 --> 01:19.067
* That's why
you don't see us *

01:19.133 --> 01:20.633
* But they still
wanna be us *

01:20.733 --> 01:23.233
Ha ha!

01:24.900 --> 01:27.967
- Damn it,
this is not yare.

01:28.067 --> 01:30.167
- Is that like a tiny ship
for ants or what?

01:30.267 --> 01:32.067
- I got it!

01:32.133 --> 01:33.733
- I'll go pose
by the fire's place.

01:33.833 --> 01:34.833
- Uh-huh.

01:34.933 --> 01:36.567
- You look so good,
Mr. Russell.

01:36.667 --> 01:38.300
- Yeah.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.567
- All right,
that's enough.

01:39.667 --> 01:42.167
Go take your germs
away somewhere else.

01:42.267 --> 01:44.967
Trick, you're soaked.

01:45.067 --> 01:48.300
Ladies, I'd like to
introduce you to

01:48.400 --> 01:49.633
Trick Malloy.

01:51.567 --> 01:52.633
* I'm so fresh, kid

01:52.733 --> 01:54.200
* I'm so fresh, fresh

01:54.300 --> 01:55.500
* 'Cause I'm fresh, kid

01:55.600 --> 01:56.733
* I'm so fresh, fresh

01:56.833 --> 01:58.800
* Yeah, I'm fresh, kid

01:58.900 --> 02:00.967
* I'm so fresh, fresh
'cause I'm fresh, kid *

02:01.067 --> 02:03.233
- Ho...
- Ly...

02:03.333 --> 02:04.400
- Ship!

02:04.500 --> 02:05.467
Holy !

02:05.567 --> 02:06.533
- Trick, my man.

02:06.633 --> 02:07.767
How was the flight?

02:07.867 --> 02:09.333
- It was good.

02:09.433 --> 02:10.867
I gave up my first-class seat
to a veteran,

02:10.967 --> 02:13.833
met some pretty solid
people back in coach,

02:13.933 --> 02:16.200
and, yeah, you know what they
say about plane friends.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.333
"Plane friends
stay friends."

02:17.433 --> 02:18.433
- I feel the same way.

02:18.533 --> 02:20.200
- I absolutely
feel the same way.

02:20.300 --> 02:21.300
- That's awesome.

02:21.400 --> 02:24.333
- Trick, this is
my wife, Tanzy.

02:24.433 --> 02:26.167
- "Enchanti."

02:26.267 --> 02:28.367
- And, uh, over here
is my daughter, Gene.

02:28.467 --> 02:29.800
- Hey.

02:29.900 --> 02:32.633
- And this is her Billie.

02:32.733 --> 02:34.333
- Oh, not in a lesbian way.
Although,

02:34.433 --> 02:36.333
I'm not afraid to do that.
How's it going?

02:36.433 --> 02:38.367
- Sorry about
my wet hand skin.

02:38.467 --> 02:39.667
- No, I like it wet.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.067
- Cool.

02:42.133 --> 02:43.500
Ship in a bottle.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.667
That's exactly how I feel
sometimes, you know?

02:45.767 --> 02:47.833
It's just like,
all sealed up

02:47.933 --> 02:50.633
behind glass
and on display.

02:50.733 --> 02:52.700
It's like the whole world's
got stones,

02:52.800 --> 02:55.133
and they're just throwing them.

02:55.233 --> 02:57.267
You know what I'm saying?

02:59.100 --> 03:01.067
- Land ho!

03:01.167 --> 03:04.100
Shipwreck.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.067
- Sorry.

03:06.133 --> 03:07.067
She's got diarrhea.

03:07.133 --> 03:08.167
- Trick, let me, uh,

03:08.267 --> 03:09.300
let me show you
to your room, huh?

03:09.400 --> 03:10.667
- Yeah, I don't.

03:10.767 --> 03:12.300
- Yes, sir.
- It's right up here.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.467
Yeah.

03:14.767 --> 03:18.467
You stepped in ship.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.333
- Oh, put it down,
put it down, Joy.

03:21.433 --> 03:23.267
Go away, take the rest
of the weekend off,

03:23.367 --> 03:26.600
'cause my boy here
has got to be ship-shape

03:26.700 --> 03:28.633
for his big press conference
tomorrow.

03:28.733 --> 03:32.167
Trick Malloy.
- Kent Russell.

03:32.267 --> 03:33.333
- I know you're thinking
of doing something else

03:33.433 --> 03:35.167
with your life.
I get it, I do.

03:35.267 --> 03:38.800
You're not a one-trick pony,
and it's a trick...y decision.

03:38.900 --> 03:40.433
You see what I'm doing here?

03:40.533 --> 03:42.333
- I do, I do.
You're having fun with my name.

03:42.433 --> 03:43.400
- Exactly.

03:43.500 --> 03:44.667
All right, so, what is it

03:44.767 --> 03:46.267
that you want to do
with your life

03:46.367 --> 03:49.067
if you're not
gonna play football?

03:49.167 --> 03:51.133
- To be honest, Ken, everything.

03:51.233 --> 03:52.433
- Ooh, I like that.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.933
- I don't know.
I want it all.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.333
I want to--I want to eat.

03:55.433 --> 03:56.767
I want to eat life.

03:56.867 --> 03:58.667
- My vagina's nickname
is "life."

03:58.767 --> 04:01.667
- Trick, I've climbed
Mount Kilimanjaro

04:01.767 --> 04:02.967
and Hillary Rodham Clinton.

04:03.067 --> 04:04.800
I have done it all.

04:04.900 --> 04:07.067
And trust me, you're not
gonna find a better gig

04:07.133 --> 04:09.533
than being a Conquistador.

04:09.633 --> 04:11.900
- That's just it, I've been
a Conquistador for ten years

04:12.067 --> 04:14.567
and I've never even been
to Conquistador, you know?

04:14.667 --> 04:16.200
Guess I'm still...

04:16.300 --> 04:17.567
still hungry.

04:17.667 --> 04:19.333
- Hmm.

04:22.733 --> 04:23.967
- She gets it.

04:26.167 --> 04:28.067
- Oops, oh, my God.

04:28.167 --> 04:29.700
I'm so clumsy.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.100
That made me all wet.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.233
We should sex this weekend.

04:34.333 --> 04:36.800
- Yeah, Trick, looks
like you're almost done.

04:36.900 --> 04:38.733
Why don't you come up to my
office, and I will show you

04:38.833 --> 04:43.733
my bronzed cast
of Apolo Ohno's hands?

04:43.833 --> 04:46.433
- Oh, yes, to Ohno,
you know?

04:47.967 --> 04:49.300
- Attaboy.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.800
- Oh, my gosh,
do you hear that?

04:53.667 --> 04:55.067
That sex train.
Do you hear it?

04:55.167 --> 04:57.633
Chugga, chugga, chugga,
chugga, his dick!

04:57.733 --> 04:58.633
You know what
I'm saying?

04:58.733 --> 05:00.133
- No, I don't.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.067
- I mean we're gonna
get it on with sex.

05:02.133 --> 05:04.600
- * Capital S
lowercase E *

05:04.700 --> 05:07.800
* Little-ass C
tiny-ass K *

05:07.900 --> 05:09.700
- Good for you,
that's just not my--

05:09.800 --> 05:12.067
I think of, like,
Trick and sex, like "blech."

05:12.167 --> 05:13.167
No, gross.

05:14.367 --> 05:15.433
- Yeah, that's what I said.

05:15.533 --> 05:17.200
I'm just--I'm not into

05:17.300 --> 05:21.500
the blue eyes, and the skin
and the symmetry

05:21.600 --> 05:23.500
and the--"I'm very gorgeous."

05:23.600 --> 05:26.167
It's not my--
I'm into brains, thoughts,

05:26.267 --> 05:27.833
mental capacities.

05:27.933 --> 05:29.567
- Oh, good, 'cause
I told him you had diarrhea.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.067
I mean, good.

05:32.133 --> 05:34.367
Thank you.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.400
- Is it just me,

05:36.500 --> 05:39.833
or is that guy
really cute?

05:44.067 --> 05:46.067
- Oh, oops.
- Sorry.

05:46.100 --> 05:47.367
- Body bump.

05:47.467 --> 05:49.233
- I call that interference,
you know?

05:49.333 --> 05:50.867
Hey, you're a teacher, right?
- Yeah.

05:50.967 --> 05:52.367
- That's awesome.
It's like

05:52.467 --> 05:53.533
you're an agent for change
or something.

05:53.633 --> 05:54.900
- Oh, yeah,

05:55.067 --> 05:57.067
I never thought of it like that.
Excuse me.

05:57.133 --> 05:58.400
- Do you ever get
scared, you know?

05:58.500 --> 06:00.433
Like scared that
your--your students

06:00.533 --> 06:02.167
will just not listen
and they'll just

06:02.267 --> 06:03.433
be distracted
by your beauty?

06:05.567 --> 06:07.133
- Might be
'cause I'm asking it.

06:07.233 --> 06:08.467
- Oh, that's really clever.

06:08.567 --> 06:10.400
Um, no, I don't.

06:12.933 --> 06:15.200
- Oh, I get scared of
a lot of things.

06:16.500 --> 06:19.733
- Um, I don't know.
Um...

06:19.833 --> 06:21.200
Um, not being in control
of my own fate?

06:21.300 --> 06:23.633
- Mm.

06:23.733 --> 06:26.633
- Or horror movies
or something--

06:26.733 --> 06:28.500
- Yeah, no,
I get that fate stuff,

06:28.600 --> 06:30.133
you know what I'm saying,
'cause I'm kinda going through

06:30.233 --> 06:31.733
a little piece of that
myself right now.

06:31.833 --> 06:34.400
It kind of reminds me of the
lyrics of that song "Changes"

06:34.500 --> 06:37.400
by that guy, Dah-vad BoweÃ©.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.533
I wanna send you those lyrics.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.367
I think you'll appreciate them
as much as I'm really

06:41.467 --> 06:44.167
just appreciating
talking to you right now.

06:44.267 --> 06:48.567
- Oh, um...um...Billie--

06:50.333 --> 06:51.633
- Uh, Billie...

06:53.900 --> 06:55.700
- Uh, Billie--

06:55.800 --> 06:58.667
- Okay, "Billie@billie.billie".
Sent.

07:01.233 --> 07:03.300
Hmm, that's weird.
It sent back.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.267
Later-ade.
- Laters.

07:05.367 --> 07:07.967
Oh, my God,
what is wrong with me?

07:08.067 --> 07:09.267
Why would you say that?

07:09.367 --> 07:10.700
- Hey, are you
talking to me?

07:10.800 --> 07:12.633
or are you talking to yourself
in the hallway?

07:19.533 --> 07:20.700
Oh, my God.

07:25.433 --> 07:26.967
- Elizabeth Barrett Browning

07:27.067 --> 07:28.967
was one of the
most important--

07:29.067 --> 07:30.600
Gene.

07:33.200 --> 07:34.300
- On and off the field,

07:34.400 --> 07:35.667
the rumors are swirling

07:35.767 --> 07:37.967
around this grid-iron bad boy.

07:38.067 --> 07:39.667
The pressure is mounting...

07:39.767 --> 07:41.167
both:
Mounting.

07:41.267 --> 07:43.067
- For him to make a decision.

07:43.100 --> 07:45.200
One thing is certain:
when that decision comes,

07:45.300 --> 07:47.567
the world will be watching.

07:47.667 --> 07:50.333
That's what makes
his choice so hard.

07:50.433 --> 07:51.600
both:
Hard.

07:53.467 --> 07:54.567
- No cheating!

07:54.667 --> 07:56.700
I'm sorry.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.067
- You're not interrupting!
- That's too loud.

07:58.133 --> 07:59.467
- I mean, you're not
interrupting.

07:59.567 --> 08:00.733
- I just, uh, I wanted to see
if I could sit in.

08:00.833 --> 08:02.067
That cool?
I didn't do

08:02.167 --> 08:03.400
a lot of class stuff,
you know?

08:03.500 --> 08:04.400
Football always came first.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.600
- I love coming first.

08:05.700 --> 08:07.367
- Of course,
absolutely.

08:07.467 --> 08:08.900
- Thanks,
what are we studying?

08:09.067 --> 08:12.633
19th century poetry.

08:12.733 --> 08:14.067
- I...

08:14.167 --> 08:18.600
yearn...for what can be

08:18.700 --> 08:21.233
to awaken the soul

08:21.333 --> 08:24.067
inside of me.

08:26.067 --> 08:27.967
- I guess my--my mouth just did.

08:28.067 --> 08:29.800
- Okay,

08:29.900 --> 08:31.533
back to the lesson.

08:31.633 --> 08:33.867
Eliza-trick Billie Brown--

08:33.967 --> 08:35.933
Eliza-trick--
Eliza-trick Billie Browning.

08:36.067 --> 08:38.433
Eliz--oops, the chalk's done.

08:38.533 --> 08:40.100
I'll go get
another one.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.700
- Chalk.

08:42.800 --> 08:44.633
Code for loose poops.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.300
Whew!

08:49.400 --> 08:50.700
Can't wait till recess

08:50.800 --> 08:52.933
so we can go masturbate,
am I right?

08:53.067 --> 08:54.300
Oops.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.300
So clumsy...

08:56.400 --> 08:57.967
and good in bed.

08:58.067 --> 08:59.500
Separate note.

09:01.133 --> 09:02.867
Can't quite get it.

09:02.967 --> 09:05.667
Got it.

09:05.767 --> 09:07.600
Oh, spaghetti fingers.

09:07.700 --> 09:09.400
Let me get that.

09:09.500 --> 09:11.933
Oh, almost--

09:12.067 --> 09:14.233
doing such a bad job
with my hands.

09:14.333 --> 09:16.600
Bad hand job,
bad hand job.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.067
Grab it.

09:18.133 --> 09:19.833
Oh, almost got it.

09:19.933 --> 09:22.667
Let me use my mouth.

09:22.767 --> 09:24.100
No.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.433
Got it.

09:34.067 --> 09:35.533
Now we're pen pals.

09:35.633 --> 09:37.200
- Holy crap.

09:38.867 --> 09:41.567
Kent wants you
to come out back

09:41.667 --> 09:44.067
so you can
play foosball together.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.067
- Foosball, yeah,

09:46.133 --> 09:48.167
I think you, uh--I think
you mean football, right?

09:48.267 --> 09:50.667
- Sure.

09:50.767 --> 09:53.400
- You.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.267
- Holy crap.

09:56.367 --> 09:57.733
I'm in love.

09:57.833 --> 09:59.700
- Got it!
Where's Trick?

10:01.533 --> 10:03.867
- Nothing, my lips were chapped
and my hair was in my face. Why?

10:03.967 --> 10:06.233
- Oh, my God, you--
you totally like him.

10:06.333 --> 10:07.833
- No, I don't.

10:07.933 --> 10:09.100
- You totally like him.
- No, I don't.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.767
- No, girl, you can tell me.

10:10.867 --> 10:12.033
You kinda like him a little bit.
- I don't like him, no.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.033
- Just know this.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.833
If it happens for one of us,

10:16.933 --> 10:19.200
the other one that's
stupid and annoying

10:19.300 --> 10:20.533
has to back off.

10:20.633 --> 10:21.867
*

10:21.967 --> 10:23.067
Hos before bros.

10:23.167 --> 10:25.600
- I'm not a ho.

10:25.700 --> 10:28.600
- Tell that
to your pink scrunchie.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.600
*

10:30.700 --> 10:32.033
This is my pen.

10:32.133 --> 10:33.700
No one can have it.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.267
- I don't want it.
- Don't come into my room

10:35.367 --> 10:37.000
for 15 minutes.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.900
- You're gonna masturbate.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.800
- You're gonna masturbate!
- You're disgusting.

10:43.433 --> 10:46.567
Wow, what a cannon.

10:46.667 --> 10:48.633
Now, you're gonna tell me

10:48.733 --> 10:51.333
that you're gonna let
that golden arm go to waste?

10:51.433 --> 10:52.733
I mean, what is this, really?

10:52.833 --> 10:54.433
Some sort of
a negotiating tactic?

10:54.533 --> 10:56.300
- No, it's not about money.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.967
It's like I have a calling,

10:58.067 --> 11:00.067
and I'm tired of letting it

11:00.100 --> 11:01.200
just go straight to voicemail.

11:01.300 --> 11:02.500
- Ring, ring.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.733
Ring, ring.

11:04.833 --> 11:07.967
Sorry, I just overheard
your metaphor.

11:08.067 --> 11:09.533
I was tending to the garden.

11:09.633 --> 11:11.067
Nice toss, by the way.

11:11.167 --> 11:13.633
That's the exact
kind of throw

11:13.733 --> 11:14.833
that would beat
a soft nickel,

11:14.933 --> 11:16.200
assuming that the safety
bites it

11:16.300 --> 11:18.167
on a fake pump,
of course.

11:18.267 --> 11:20.633
- Didn't know you knew so much
about football, Billie.

11:20.733 --> 11:21.800
- She doesn't.

11:21.900 --> 11:23.967
She's just trying
to impress me.

11:24.067 --> 11:26.367
She doesn't know...

11:26.467 --> 11:27.367
she already has.

11:28.900 --> 11:30.400
- Your beautiful lip color,

11:30.500 --> 11:31.667
with your scrunchie.

11:33.267 --> 11:34.533
Thank you.

11:34.633 --> 11:35.900
- You're welcome.

11:36.067 --> 11:38.067
- Ugh!

11:38.133 --> 11:40.500
These things get so dirty,
you know?

11:40.600 --> 11:43.233
Oh, get 'em
a little wet, you know?

11:43.333 --> 11:45.267
Oh, squirter.

11:45.367 --> 11:46.800
- That's weird that
they get so dirty.

11:46.900 --> 11:48.700
Don't they just sit
in the water all day?

11:48.800 --> 11:51.067
- I'm pretending
they're penises.

11:51.167 --> 11:53.267
- Okay, Trick,
why don't we go inside?

11:53.367 --> 11:55.733
I'll show you my, uh,
upside down room

11:55.833 --> 11:57.467
where all the furniture
right over here is,

11:57.567 --> 11:59.467
you know, attached
to the ceiling.

11:59.567 --> 12:01.067
- Cool, I love
not sitting down.

12:01.133 --> 12:02.467
- Hey,

12:02.567 --> 12:03.933
since when did you start

12:04.067 --> 12:06.333
hand-jobbing
the pool equipment?

12:06.433 --> 12:10.500
- Same time you started
using a hoe, ho.

12:15.433 --> 12:16.933
- Good night.

12:17.067 --> 12:18.367
No, uh...

12:18.467 --> 12:20.333
Good night.

12:20.433 --> 12:22.667
Bonne nuit, Trick.
Bonne nuit--

12:24.233 --> 12:25.867
What are you doing?

12:25.967 --> 12:26.933
both:
Where--

12:28.267 --> 12:29.433
- Just gonna go say
good night to Trick,

12:29.533 --> 12:31.133
see if he needs anything
before bed.

12:31.233 --> 12:32.967
Where are you going?

12:33.067 --> 12:34.967
- I was also gonna go...

12:35.067 --> 12:37.833
see if he needed
to be put to bed.

12:37.933 --> 12:39.867
- Ass before class.

12:43.067 --> 12:45.900
Hey, Trick.

12:46.067 --> 12:48.433
- Hey.
- Books, nice.

12:48.533 --> 12:49.900
I've read about those.

12:50.067 --> 12:51.167
- Cool.

12:51.267 --> 12:52.367
-Just wanted to come
say good night.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.733
Thinking about turning in.

12:54.833 --> 12:59.167
Unless I stay up to,
I don't know, have sex.

12:59.267 --> 13:01.733
- Okay, night, night.

13:01.833 --> 13:06.133
- Oh...okay.

13:07.700 --> 13:08.967
Good luck in there.

13:09.067 --> 13:10.933
There's jizz
all over the walls.

13:11.067 --> 13:12.333
- No.

13:12.433 --> 13:14.367
My hand.

13:17.900 --> 13:19.267
Good night, Trick.

13:32.567 --> 13:34.100
- You touching yourself
to porno?

13:34.200 --> 13:35.967
- No, Gene,
I'm not watching porno.

13:36.067 --> 13:38.067
- Yeah, me neither.
Who watches porno?

13:38.133 --> 13:39.800
What is that, the "Labyrinth"
in the background?

13:39.900 --> 13:41.067
You watching the "Labyrinth?"

13:41.167 --> 13:42.533
- No, it's not the "Labyrinth."

13:42.633 --> 13:44.167
It's--I don't need to watch

13:44.267 --> 13:45.833
the "Labyrinth" to fall asleep.

13:45.933 --> 13:47.333
It's a different movie.

13:47.433 --> 13:48.733
Go to sleep.

13:51.233 --> 13:52.367
Oh, Dickolas Cage.

13:52.467 --> 13:55.200
That makes more sense.

14:01.833 --> 14:09.767
*

14:16.867 --> 14:19.900
- * Today I found her

14:20.067 --> 14:22.267
* We're so meant to be

14:22.367 --> 14:27.200
* The only question,
would she marry me? *

14:27.300 --> 14:29.467
* 'Cause if she does

14:29.567 --> 14:33.933
* All the people
of Earth will talk *

14:34.067 --> 14:36.233
* They'll say

14:36.333 --> 14:39.267
* It's Trick and Billie

14:39.367 --> 14:41.500
* Look at those two

14:41.600 --> 14:44.133
* I know we're silly

14:44.233 --> 14:48.100
* Can I get a pic of you?

14:48.200 --> 14:51.467
*

14:51.567 --> 14:54.433
* The people of Earth

14:54.533 --> 15:02.167
* Will talk

15:02.267 --> 15:04.067
*

15:09.700 --> 15:10.867
- Harder!

15:10.967 --> 15:12.267
Ah, harder!

15:13.667 --> 15:15.767
Jay Baruchel!

15:15.867 --> 15:17.567
- Oh, so sorry, Jay!

15:17.667 --> 15:20.600
Jay, oh, Baruchel!
- Whoo, Canada!

15:28.067 --> 15:30.067
- Oops.

15:30.133 --> 15:32.667
Ooh, sorry, didn't mean
to scare a fart out of you.

15:32.767 --> 15:34.367
- I didn't fart, Gene.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.933
It stinks because no one's been

15:36.067 --> 15:37.733
cleaning up after themselves
since Joy left.

15:39.333 --> 15:41.200
- Just making some
Belgian waffles for Trick.

15:41.300 --> 15:43.200
It's his favorite.
I Google'd it.

15:43.300 --> 15:44.833
- That's so nice of you.

15:44.933 --> 15:46.400
- Well, you know,
he's a guest.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.867
I figured we might as well
be hospitable, and...

15:48.967 --> 15:52.400
Fun fact: his favorite
lunch food is a BL--

15:57.833 --> 15:59.400
Bitch.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.333
- Hey, Trick, I know waffles
are your favorite.

16:02.433 --> 16:05.767
Probably need all the energy
you can get after last night.

16:05.867 --> 16:07.067
You nasty.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.100
What happened last night?

16:09.200 --> 16:10.100
- Well, let's just say

16:10.200 --> 16:12.200
you had sex with Jay Baruchel,

16:12.300 --> 16:13.567
and it was good.

16:13.667 --> 16:15.333
- You mean that
dude that goes...

16:15.433 --> 16:16.867
"I wrote and directed 'Goon.'

16:16.967 --> 16:18.067
I wrote and directed it."

16:18.167 --> 16:19.900
- No, I don't
recognize that.

16:20.067 --> 16:22.133
- No, uh-huh.

16:22.233 --> 16:24.633
- Mmm, those waffles
are really good.

16:24.733 --> 16:26.967
- Gene, you don't
have to do that.

16:28.567 --> 16:30.967
- You know how you act
all sexual around me?

16:31.067 --> 16:33.300
You don't have to do that.
I like you.

16:34.800 --> 16:37.667
Spelled with a U.

16:37.767 --> 16:38.733
- 'Cause see, when I hear
those words...

16:38.833 --> 16:40.700
- Mm-hmm.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.567
- All of this...

16:42.667 --> 16:44.300
- Jesus.
- More feels like--

16:44.400 --> 16:45.700
it looks like this.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.567
- Tears of--
- Tears.

16:49.067 --> 16:51.067
- Just let the sexuality go.

16:51.100 --> 16:53.533
You're more than your sex.

16:55.933 --> 16:57.900
- I cry when I listen
to Lennie Annox.

16:58.067 --> 17:00.367
- No, Annie Lennox, yeah,
that's--that's it.

17:00.467 --> 17:03.233
- Whoa,
I feel hella vulnerable.

17:03.333 --> 17:05.400
- Yeah.

17:05.500 --> 17:06.967
- Gene, can I talk to you

17:07.067 --> 17:08.100
inside for a second?

17:08.200 --> 17:09.600
- Sure-cicles.

17:09.700 --> 17:11.733
Poor thing,
all that diarrhea.

17:11.833 --> 17:15.300
She just found out.
Bottom AIDS.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.300
Life is short,
you know?

17:16.400 --> 17:17.300
- Hey, Gene.

17:18.800 --> 17:22.700
- It's really nice
to finally meet you.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.967
- You too.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.067
What's up?

17:28.100 --> 17:29.100
- That was not cool, Gene.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.667
Do you know how hard it is

17:30.767 --> 17:32.600
to make Belgian waffles
without a waffle maker?

17:36.733 --> 17:38.533
- I'm sorry, all I hear
is French music

17:38.633 --> 17:39.800
when I'm in love.
What'd you say?

17:39.900 --> 17:41.267
- You can't possibly think

17:41.367 --> 17:42.367
he's into you, can you?

17:42.467 --> 17:43.800
- Mm, I don't know.

17:43.900 --> 17:45.367
We sort of have this
"will they, won't they"

17:45.467 --> 17:47.133
thing happening,
you know?

17:47.233 --> 17:50.200
- Let me just cut to the end
for you, hmm?

17:50.300 --> 17:53.533
They won't, okay?

17:58.367 --> 18:00.600
Did you just throw
garbage at me?

18:02.067 --> 18:04.767
No, I don't think so.

18:04.867 --> 18:07.067
Oh, wait, yeah,
I totally did.

18:07.133 --> 18:09.533
- It was a rhetorical question.

18:09.633 --> 18:10.933
Bitch!

18:12.467 --> 18:13.967
- Come on, get your
head on the ground.

18:14.067 --> 18:16.133
- No, I'm uncomfortable
by your vagina--

18:16.233 --> 18:17.467
- You want balls
in your mouth.

18:17.567 --> 18:20.100
Eat it!
Come here!

18:20.200 --> 18:21.133
Not the beets!

18:21.233 --> 18:23.267
Not the beets!

18:23.367 --> 18:25.633
- You look egg-cellent.

18:25.733 --> 18:28.333
- Well, this just in.
He's nacho man!

18:28.433 --> 18:29.767
Oh!
- Turkey slap!

18:29.867 --> 18:32.433
- Salad joke!

18:32.533 --> 18:33.967
- Yokes on you!

18:34.067 --> 18:35.233
- Does this remind you
of your childhood?

18:35.333 --> 18:36.633
Trash!

18:36.733 --> 18:39.467
- Kent, thank you so much
for your hospitality,

18:39.567 --> 18:41.300
but your house
smells like garbage.

18:41.400 --> 18:42.767
- Fair criticism.

18:42.867 --> 18:44.600
But I trust tomorrow's
press conference

18:44.700 --> 18:46.267
will yield happiness,
yes, yes?

18:46.367 --> 18:48.733
- I think we'll both be smiling.
- Ooh.

18:48.833 --> 18:49.933
- Yeah, maybe even laughing.

18:53.067 --> 18:54.300
- Name stuff still happening.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.633
- Yeah, come on, get in here.

18:55.733 --> 18:56.833
- All right.

18:58.367 --> 19:01.467
- Listen, you...

19:01.567 --> 19:06.167
are my best
and closest friend.

19:06.267 --> 19:07.667
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

19:07.767 --> 19:08.733
- Thank you.

19:08.833 --> 19:10.367
- Yeah.

19:10.467 --> 19:11.733
- All right, see you, buddy.

19:11.833 --> 19:13.500
- Yeah, man.

19:13.600 --> 19:16.967
[both shouting
and making gun noises]

19:17.067 --> 19:18.500
- Well,

19:18.600 --> 19:20.900
I guess we should get
Joy back in here

19:21.067 --> 19:22.167
now that Trick's gone.

19:23.800 --> 19:24.867
- Mm.

19:24.967 --> 19:26.967
I think that went well.

19:27.067 --> 19:29.267
Mm, yeah,
that went quite well.

19:31.267 --> 19:33.133
- Bitch!
No!

19:33.233 --> 19:38.467
Okay, truce.

19:38.567 --> 19:40.233
- I wonder if Trick's gonna
send me some sort of a signal.

19:40.333 --> 19:41.800
You know, like rub his nose
or, like, pull on his dick.

19:41.900 --> 19:43.267
- He's not going to.
You're delusional.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.667
- Girls, girls, hush, hush!

19:46.767 --> 19:48.533
Shut it, it's starting.
Thank you.

19:48.633 --> 19:50.467
- Good afternoon,
I think we all know

19:50.567 --> 19:52.767
that I've come to a bit
of a crossroads in my life,

19:52.867 --> 19:55.367
and, you know, I got
some really great advice

19:55.467 --> 19:57.367
from a really good friend
this weekend.

19:57.467 --> 19:58.967
- And, uh...

19:59.067 --> 20:01.367
that advice was to
remove the clutter.

20:01.467 --> 20:04.533
And that clutter is football.

20:04.633 --> 20:06.467
Kent Russell, I love you,

20:06.567 --> 20:08.633
and I would've never been able
to make this decision.

20:08.733 --> 20:11.033
I was wavering,
and you made it for me.

20:11.133 --> 20:13.200
Dude, I'm gonna
follow my dreams.

20:13.300 --> 20:14.867
I'm gonna be a stand-up comic.

20:14.967 --> 20:17.033
- No.

20:17.133 --> 20:18.800
I mean, how you guys
doing out there?

20:20.433 --> 20:21.467
Like, what's the deal
with that name?

20:21.567 --> 20:23.367
- Greg, my man!

20:23.467 --> 20:24.833
- It's weird, it's like
some dude took your quarter.

20:24.933 --> 20:26.267
- I don't like comedy.

20:26.367 --> 20:27.967
I didn't say that.
I didn't say that!

20:28.067 --> 20:29.667
- I see a lot of ladies
out there.

20:29.767 --> 20:32.500
:
Love me the ladies, oh, hey.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.467
I met this girl, right?
She's all like,

20:34.567 --> 20:37.000
"Oh, man, I like, cry every
time I listen to Annie Lennox,"

20:37.100 --> 20:39.700
and I'm like, "Annie Len-nah,
that sucks, dude.

20:39.800 --> 20:42.300
Don't cry at Annie Lennox."
You know what also sucks?

20:42.400 --> 20:44.067
Like, generally when,
like, women are like,

20:44.167 --> 20:45.733
"Yeah, I like sports,"

20:45.833 --> 20:47.333
and you're just like, "Go knit.

20:47.433 --> 20:48.567
Like, prune a tree or something

20:48.667 --> 20:50.233
or prune this dick.
Mm!"

20:51.800 --> 20:52.700
- You guys are fun.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.333
- What a train wreck.

20:54.433 --> 20:57.333
- Yeah, like, turns out
we're out of his league.

21:01.433 --> 21:03.833
- And don't even get me
started on traffic, right?

21:03.933 --> 21:06.700
It's like--
just all go the same speed.

21:15.467 --> 21:17.167
Like, what is that about?

21:17.267 --> 21:18.967
I don't actually think that
that--that space is real.

21:19.067 --> 21:21.667
I think people just keep
saying that it's real

21:21.767 --> 21:24.367
and saying that like,
that there's stuff out there

21:24.467 --> 21:27.433
but it's like, we're never
gonna know for real.

21:27.533 --> 21:28.067
You can't go there.
