A REAL DOCTOR.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.094
- MY CHARACTER GETS KILLED

02:16.177 --> 02:19.055

I'VE GOT TO CALL MY AGENT.

THE SUPERMODEL DOCTOR HERE?

POOFERTY IS WHEN FAIRY BABIES
GO FROM SAYING "POOF, POOF"

02:34.737 --> 02:35.655
TO ACTUAL WORDS.

02:35.738 --> 02:38.157
BUT WHILE POOF MAKES
THE TRANSITION,

02:38.241 --> 02:40.451
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND
A THING HE SAYS.

02:40.535 --> 02:42.620
- WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN'T
UNDERSTAND HIM,

02:42.704 --> 02:44.372

02:44.455 --> 02:45.248
- [babbling]

02:45.331 --> 02:47.458
- HE EITHER SAID HE'S HUNGRY

OR THAT I LEFT
THE SOGGY OVEN ON.

02:49.502 --> 02:50.920
I'M BETTING HE'S HUNGRY.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.547
boom!

02:52.630 --> 02:53.381
I BET WRONG.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.633
- IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO

02:55.717 --> 02:57.594
FOR MY BABY,
DR. STUDWELL?

02:57.677 --> 02:59.888
- DON'T WORRY, HE'LL COME
OUT OF THE FISH BOWL EVENTUALLY.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.431
- SHE MEANT POOF.

03:01.514 --> 03:02.599
- OH, RIGHT.

03:02.682 --> 03:03.433
WELL, ALL WE CAN DO
IS GIVE HIM

03:03.516 --> 03:06.227
THIS LIST OF WORDS TO PRACTICE.

03:06.311 --> 03:09.564
- "EXTERIOR: ARCTIC CIRCLE, DAY.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.490
AND EVENTUALLY,
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SPEAK

03:19.574 --> 03:20.033
AS GOOD AS I TALK.

03:20.116 --> 03:23.703
- [babbling]

03:26.623 --> 03:27.373
- NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

03:27.457 --> 03:28.416
I HAVE TO GET BACK TO THE SET

03:28.499 --> 03:31.169

WANDER OFF.

WHISTLING BETWEEN THEIR EARS.

03:39.177 --> 03:40.470
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.889
- [babbling]

03:42.972 --> 03:44.474
- I CAN TRANSLATE THAT.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.559
HE EITHER SAID HE'LL SEE YOU
AFTER SCHOOL,

03:46.643 --> 03:48.728
OR HE'S MARRYING A SIAMESE CAT.

03:48.811 --> 03:50.313
EITHER WAY, I ACCEPT HIM.

03:50.396 --> 03:53.274
I'M PROUD OF MY WEIRD,
CAT-LOVING SON.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.279
[bell ringing]

03:58.363 --> 04:00.740
- OH, GOOD,
IT'S DARK IN HERE.

04:00.823 --> 04:02.825
I WON'T HAVE TO USE
MY SLEEP MASK.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.744
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

04:04.827 --> 04:07.121

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

04:09.332 --> 04:13.169
HERE'S YOUR HOST,
DENZEL CROCKER.

04:13.252 --> 04:14.587

F DANCERS!

04:19.175 --> 04:20.843
SORRY I HAVEN'T GRADED
YOUR PAPERS YET.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.637

REHEARSING THIS NUMBER.

BRING IT ON HOME!

04:30.269 --> 04:31.521

04:31.604 --> 04:32.522

04:32.605 --> 04:33.982

04:34.065 --> 04:36.359

04:46.536 --> 04:49.288
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE
MY LATEST INVENTION.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.624
I CALL IT MY ABRA-CA-BLENDER!

04:51.708 --> 04:54.502
THIS BABY WILL DRAIN THE MAGIC
FROM ANY MAGICAL CREATURE

04:54.585 --> 04:56.045
AND TURN IT INTO
A DELICIOUS SMOOTHIE!

04:56.129 --> 04:58.423
AND ONCE I DRINK IT,

04:58.506 --> 05:00.008
I'LL HAVE THE CREATURES POWERS

05:00.091 --> 05:01.342
WITH A PROTEIN BOOST.

05:01.426 --> 05:02.510
- HEY, MR. NUT JOB,

05:02.593 --> 05:04.012
CAN WE LEARN SOMETHING NOW?

05:04.095 --> 05:05.054
- DON'T TRY TO DISTRACT ME,
TURNER.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.473
I KNOW YOU HAVE FAIRIES!

05:07.557 --> 05:09.308
AND AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

05:09.392 --> 05:10.935
I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION
THAT THEY'RE DISGUISED

05:11.019 --> 05:12.395
AS YOUR STUPID PINK HAT,

05:12.478 --> 05:15.398

THE MAGIC FROM.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.608

05:20.987 --> 05:22.697
OOPS, HAD THE SETTINGS UP
TOO HIGH.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.115
OH, WELL, BOTTOM'S UP.

05:25.825 --> 05:26.951
GAH!

05:27.035 --> 05:28.578
I DON'T FEEL MAGICAL AT ALL.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.830
ALL RIGHT, KIDS,
READ CHAPTER THREE

05:30.913 --> 05:31.497
WHILE I GO THROW UP HAT JUICE.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.503
- BOY, TIMMY, MR. CROCKER'S
REALLY OUT OF CONTROL.

05:37.587 --> 05:40.923
- YEAH, IF HE CAN PUT A HAT
IN A BLENDER,

05:41.007 --> 05:43.676
THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT KIND OF
EVIL HE'S CAPABLE OF.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.054
THE NEXT TIME,
IT COULD BE YOUR PENCIL.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.014
HOLY COW,
WE'RE YOUR PENCILS!

05:48.097 --> 05:49.348
- COSMO'S RIGHT.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.267
YOU GUYS ARE IN DANGER,

05:51.350 --> 05:53.603
AND IT'S TIME WE GOT RID OF
MR. CROCKER ONCE AND FOR ALL.

05:53.686 --> 05:56.439
I WISH HE WERE TRANSFERRED
TO A NEW SCHOOL.

05:56.522 --> 05:59.192
AND MAKE IT THE ONE THAT'S
THE FARTHEST AWAY FROM HERE.

05:59.275 --> 06:00.109

RIGHT BACK UP.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.454
[retches]

06:11.537 --> 06:13.456
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I WAS TRANSFERRED

06:13.539 --> 06:14.624
TO ANOTHER SCHOOL.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.959
BOY, YOU TRY TO
SHAPE YOUNG MINDS

06:17.043 --> 06:18.252
AND SKIM A LITTLE MONEY
FROM THE PTA FUND,

06:18.336 --> 06:20.630
AND THIS IS THE THANKS YOU GET.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.298

NEVER HEARD OF IT.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.468
I'LL JUST PLUG THE COORDINATES
INTO THE OLD GPS,

06:25.551 --> 06:25.593
AND I'M OFF.

06:29.597 --> 06:33.059

MAY HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE.

06:33.142 --> 06:35.311
APPARENTLY THE LEAD'S
WHAT KEEPS YOU ON THE GROUND.

06:35.394 --> 06:36.312

06:43.319 --> 06:44.821
OOH, THAT WAS A BUMPY RIDE.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.823
I THINK I BURPED UP
A LITTLE HAT JUICE.

06:46.906 --> 06:49.325
[children cheering]

06:49.408 --> 06:50.827
NOTHING ODD HERE.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.371
JUST A TYPICAL BUNCH
OF BRATTY BRATS.

06:53.454 --> 06:55.498
SHE MUST UNLEADED GAS
IN HER BROOM.

06:55.581 --> 06:58.584
AH, THAT'S THE STRANGE LITTLE
KID FROM MY NEIGHBOR'S LAWN.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.461
WAIT A MINUTE!

07:00.545 --> 07:01.295
A LITTLE KID TYING HIS OWN SHOE?

07:01.379 --> 07:03.506
HE MUST BE MAGICAL!

07:03.589 --> 07:04.715
GAH!

07:04.799 --> 07:06.175
THIS IS A SCHOOL
FOR MAGICAL CHILDREN.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.010
I'VE HIT THE JACKPOT.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.638
BUT GIVEN THAT I'M
A WORLD-FAMOUS FAIRY HUNTER,

07:10.721 --> 07:13.182
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
ONE OF THESE BRATS WILL KNOW ME.

07:14.100 --> 07:14.684
- MOVE IT, WEIRDO.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.185
- YEP, THEY KNOW ME.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.271
TIME FOR A CLEVER DISGUISE.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.858
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

07:21.941 --> 07:25.153
I'M YOUR NEW TEACHER,
MR. SACKLUNCH.

07:25.236 --> 07:28.030

07:28.114 --> 07:29.782
[tittering]

07:33.161 --> 07:34.745
- CHECK THIS OUT, SAMMY.

07:34.829 --> 07:38.332
I RIGGED A VOICE-ACTIVATED
FAIRY WHACKER TO THE DOOR.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.917

"POOF, POOF!"

08:06.277 --> 08:08.112

- GOOD MORNING, CHILDREN.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.206
NO!

08:18.289 --> 08:19.916

08:19.999 --> 08:21.167
FINALLY A TEACHER WORTH
SUCKING UP TO.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.502
ALL RIGHT, STUDENTS.

08:23.586 --> 08:25.129
I'M ANXIOUS TO DRAIN YOU
OF YOUR MAGIC--

08:25.213 --> 08:27.173
I MEAN, GET TO KNOW YOU BETTER.

08:27.256 --> 08:29.091
- OOH, MR. SACKLUNCH.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.635
LET ME SHOW YOU MY MAGIC.

08:30.718 --> 08:31.928
IT'S SUPER SCARY,
AND IT WORKS BEST

08:32.010 --> 08:35.014
IF USED ON AN INNOCENT VICTIM
LIKE POOF OVER HERE.

08:35.097 --> 08:35.681
- [babbling]

08:35.765 --> 08:36.933
- IS THAT GIBBERISH,

08:37.015 --> 08:39.309
OR CAN I JUST NOT HEAR YOU
THROUGH THIS PAPER BAG?

08:39.393 --> 08:40.352
- [babbling]

08:40.436 --> 08:42.313
- ENOUGH BABY TALK, KID.

08:42.395 --> 08:44.440
YOU SHOULD BE USING REAL WORDS
AT YOUR AGE.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.150
AND YOU CERTAINLY SHOULDN'T HAVE
A RATTLE.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.360
GIVE ME THAT.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.739
- [babbling]

08:51.822 --> 08:53.950
- ON THAT NOTE OF CLARITY,
CLASS DISMISSED.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.701
YOUR HOMEWORK IS TO PREPARE
FOR A MAGICAL SHOW-AND-TELL,

08:55.785 --> 08:57.912
WHERE EACH OF YOU WILL
DEMONSTRATE YOUR POWERS.

08:57.995 --> 09:01.123
- BUT WE'VE ONLY BEEN HERE
FOR TEN MINUTES,

09:01.207 --> 09:02.458
AND I WANT TO LEARN SOMETHING.

09:02.541 --> 09:05.670
- OH, YOU WANT TO
LEARN SOMETHING?

09:05.753 --> 09:06.754
LEARN TO DUCK!

09:08.381 --> 09:10.633

09:10.716 --> 09:11.842
- SEE YOU TOMORROW, CHILDREN.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.098
GREAT, NOW I'M HAVING
A BAG HAIR DAY.

09:17.181 --> 09:19.225
BUT WHO CARES?

09:19.308 --> 09:20.768
TOMORROW,
I, DENZEL CROCKER,

09:20.851 --> 09:22.144
WILL SUCK THE MAGIC
OUT OF THOSE LITTLE BRATS

09:22.228 --> 09:25.523

- [babbling]

09:26.232 --> 09:28.359
- GAH!

09:28.442 --> 09:29.902
YOU OVERHEARD MY LITTLE SECRET,
DID YOU?

09:29.986 --> 09:31.237
WELL, YOU CAN'T TELL ON ME.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.281
NO ONE CAN UNDERSTAND
A WORD YOU SAY.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.074
AND AS FAR AS ANYONE ELSE KNOWS,

09:35.157 --> 09:36.242
I'M STILL MR. SACKLUNCH.

09:36.325 --> 09:39.495
SEE YOU TOMORROW
WHEN YOUR MAGIC WILL BE MINE.

09:39.578 --> 09:40.830
[cackling]

09:40.913 --> 09:41.831
[gags]

09:41.914 --> 09:43.082
YUCK!

09:43.165 --> 09:45.251
HOW AM I STILL BURPING UP
HAT JUICE?

09:52.591 --> 09:54.385
- HEY, SPORT, HOW WAS THE REST
OF YOUR DAY

09:54.468 --> 09:55.678
WITHOUT MR. CROCKER?

09:55.761 --> 09:56.679
- I DON'T KNOW.

09:56.762 --> 09:57.930
I SLEPT THROUGH IT.

09:58.014 --> 09:58.723
- HOW ARE YOU EVER GONNA
LEARN ANYTHING

09:58.806 --> 10:01.142
IF YOU NEVER PAY ATTENTION?

10:03.602 --> 10:05.563
- HEY, TIMMY,
WHEN DID YOU GET A DOG?

10:05.646 --> 10:07.023
- THAT'S SPARKY, COSMO.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.274
I'VE HAD HIM FOR MONTHS.

10:08.357 --> 10:09.734
- OH, RIGHT.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.736
WHO'S THE CHICK
WITH THE PINK HAIR?

10:11.819 --> 10:13.654
- HOW'D TRAFFIC SCHOOL GO,
SPARKY?

10:13.738 --> 10:14.864
- NO IDEA, TIMMY.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.115
I SLEPT THROUGH IT.

10:16.198 --> 10:17.867
THEN I FORGOT TO
TAKE MY SLEEP MASK OFF

10:17.950 --> 10:18.868
WHEN I DROVE OFF,

10:18.951 --> 10:20.119
AND I HIT AN F DANCER.

10:20.202 --> 10:21.412
SHE'S OKAY.

10:21.495 --> 10:22.580
IN FACT,
WE'RE HAVING DINNER LATER.

10:24.582 --> 10:27.084

OH, RIGHT.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.966
AND WHERE'S YOUR MAGIC RATTLE?

10:34.050 --> 10:37.053

10:37.136 --> 10:38.220
- CALM DOWN, POOF.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.388

10:39.472 --> 10:41.724

10:55.154 --> 10:56.238
I WANT TIMMY TO BE MY PARTNER.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.324

10:58.407 --> 10:59.241
GAME OVER.
WE WIN!

10:59.325 --> 11:01.035

POOF IS TRYING TO TELL US
SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

11:02.661 --> 11:05.414
