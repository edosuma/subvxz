00:07.023 --> 00:08.148
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

00:08.358 --> 00:10.986
- Someone's down!
- We have to wait for a secure area.

00:11.194 --> 00:12.456
We should not be out here!

00:12.662 --> 00:15.460
I thought you smoothed things
between ER and paramedics?

00:15.665 --> 00:18.293
You're my new intern.
I just gave you an order.

00:18.501 --> 00:20.628
I wasn't aware Reece had
a hearing problem.

00:20.837 --> 00:21.997
My son is my business.

00:22.205 --> 00:26.039
And I'm not interested in continuing
as Interim Chief.

00:26.242 --> 00:27.072
Beard is stuck!

00:27.277 --> 00:31.043
I wouldn't have asked if you had
told me what you were doing.

00:31.247 --> 00:33.807
Sorry you thought it was
your business to ask me.

00:34.417 --> 00:36.817
Carter? What are you doing here?

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:05.548 --> 01:08.449
Hey! Morning, Carter.

01:08.918 --> 01:13.116
That's Grace Jones.
Hey, I didn't wake you up, did I?

01:13.323 --> 01:15.052
I mean, you're on at 7.

01:15.258 --> 01:18.318
Yeah. But no problem.

01:18.528 --> 01:20.996
Good. You settling in down there?

01:21.197 --> 01:23.495
Yes, I like it.

01:26.236 --> 01:28.932
You have a very interesting
CD collection.

01:29.239 --> 01:30.228
What?

01:30.440 --> 01:33.568
I said, you have
a very eclectic CD collection!

01:34.144 --> 01:35.133
Thanks.

01:37.313 --> 01:39.406
Anything you want to listen to,
just ask.

01:39.616 --> 01:41.607
Don't ever touch it on your own,
though.

01:41.818 --> 01:46.414
I've rented to a lot of students,
so I had to make that a rule.

01:46.923 --> 01:49.858
Carter, let me make you one
of these, man.

01:50.059 --> 01:52.721
It'll slingshot you into your day.

01:53.563 --> 01:55.190
You're in a really good mood.

01:55.899 --> 02:00.268
I'm just so glad to be
100 percent focused on medicine.

02:02.238 --> 02:04.468
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Sure.

02:05.008 --> 02:08.000
Do you find it easy to evaluate
other people's work?

02:08.645 --> 02:10.669
Time to grade your student?

02:11.481 --> 02:12.971
I worry about being too harsh.

02:13.416 --> 02:16.044
Does she deserve to be judged harshly?

02:17.153 --> 02:18.745
I want to be fair.

02:19.355 --> 02:22.791
Lucy hasn't gotten off
to a great start this year, clearly.

02:23.493 --> 02:25.791
But she's smart and
she's willing to work hard.

02:25.995 --> 02:30.591
Maybe I should go easy, give her
a chance to turn things around.

02:33.837 --> 02:36.135
Go on. Keep talking.

02:41.811 --> 02:42.641
A stripper?

02:42.846 --> 02:46.942
I said, "Damn! Can't you cover that
up?" She was destroying the magic.

02:47.150 --> 02:48.981
I thought I'd ride along this morning.

02:49.185 --> 02:51.346
It's more fun than the hospital,
isn't it?

02:51.554 --> 02:55.217
He likes it on the frontlines,
or we need closer supervision.

02:55.658 --> 02:58.821
- Somebody's gotta keep an eye on you.
- Hey, doc. Here!

03:00.997 --> 03:04.728
By the way, can I crash here tonight?
My building's being fumigated.

03:04.934 --> 03:07.300
Have to ask the captain.
Shouldn't be a problem.

03:07.503 --> 03:09.937
You can sleep on a Barcalounger.
I've done that.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.465
Who paged me?

03:12.675 --> 03:15.769
I got an 87-year-old man
with cholangitis for you.

03:15.979 --> 03:19.813
I stopped taking admits at 6:30.
Why didn't you page the on-call team?

03:20.016 --> 03:24.680
He came in while you were on call.
Dr. Romano specifically asked for you.

03:24.921 --> 03:27.685
- How sick is he?
- He's septic, intubated...

03:27.891 --> 03:32.123
...hypotensive and in renal...
- No, no! This can't be happening.

03:32.328 --> 03:36.492
Look, I haven't had a nap in the last
24 hours. Rounds are starting.

03:36.699 --> 03:38.599
I have to take a shower,
I smell bad.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.928
And you give me a patient
sick as a dog?

03:41.137 --> 03:42.104
What does that say?

03:42.338 --> 03:46.035
What does that say? 6:38!
I'm not on call!

03:47.043 --> 03:48.977
He's in Curtain 3.

03:52.949 --> 03:54.143
We've all been there.

03:54.350 --> 03:56.011
Shut up.

04:46.669 --> 04:50.127
- Tony Broadway?
- That a great porn star name, or what?

04:50.340 --> 04:54.003
- Carol, want to know your porno name?
- What?

04:54.210 --> 04:56.474
Take your middle name
and the street you live on.

04:56.679 --> 04:59.580
Like, mine would be Anthony Broadway.
Tony Broadway.

04:59.782 --> 05:02.615
You're mixed up. That's your
romance novelist's name.

05:02.819 --> 05:05.185
- Excuse me?
- Your porno name is your pet name...

05:05.388 --> 05:09.449
...with your mother's maiden name.
My name would be Nibbles McGee.

05:09.659 --> 05:11.422
Nibbles. That's a great porno name.

05:11.627 --> 05:15.119
Mine would be Fluffy Florez.
If you don't have a pet?

05:15.331 --> 05:17.663
- Use one you had as a kid.
- Nibbles is a great name.

05:17.867 --> 05:19.334
I don't think that's right.

05:19.535 --> 05:21.503
- What would yours be?
- Mine wouldn't work.

05:21.704 --> 05:24.468
Have we gotten a package
from Lakeside Supply?

05:24.674 --> 05:26.938
- This early?
- It's supposed to arrive overnight.

05:27.143 --> 05:28.303
Tell me when it's here.

05:28.511 --> 05:30.376
Kerry, have you got a minute?

05:30.580 --> 05:33.014
We need to prepare
these Attending schedules.

05:33.216 --> 05:35.616
I'm not familiar with
the computer down here.

05:35.818 --> 05:39.310
It's a snap. Jerry can take
you through it.

05:39.522 --> 05:41.956
- Can you give me a hand?
- I got a lot of patients.

05:42.158 --> 05:45.127
Dr. Anspaugh, got a woman
complaining about her bill.

05:45.328 --> 05:47.262
She was charged for procedures
not done.

05:47.463 --> 05:48.828
Why are you telling me?

05:49.032 --> 05:51.398
Those calls go to
the Chief of Emergency.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.501
Or the Interim Chief.

05:53.703 --> 05:57.730
Tell her you'll pull her chart
and call her within two days.

05:58.541 --> 06:01.635
I don't know how I'm supposed
to learn in this environment.

06:01.844 --> 06:03.869
Our relationship has turned
adversarial...

06:04.080 --> 06:06.412
...and it's not good for the patients.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.743
Dr. Carter, we need to talk.

06:09.986 --> 06:12.284
Hey, Lucy. Is everything all right?

06:12.488 --> 06:14.718
You're talking to yourself.
Not a bad thing...

06:14.924 --> 06:18.792
Actually, do you think I should
sit down and talk to Dr. Carter?

06:18.995 --> 06:23.762
Depends on how direct you want to be.
You don't want to be confrontational.

06:23.966 --> 06:26.161
- You don't want him to be defensive.
- Right.

06:26.369 --> 06:27.666
I'd do it over a meal.

06:27.870 --> 06:31.431
Oh, like a chat. I like that.
Makes sense.

06:31.741 --> 06:33.538
Oh, damn!

06:34.510 --> 06:35.499
Hey, Lucy?

06:36.079 --> 06:38.343
Could you get me a tampon
from the thingy?

06:38.548 --> 06:40.448
Oh, I got one here.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.049
Damn it.

06:43.453 --> 06:44.784
- There you go.
- Thanks a lot.

06:45.188 --> 06:46.314
Peter, sorry I'm late.

06:46.522 --> 06:49.047
I was in the ER with an admission
you need to see.

06:49.258 --> 06:51.021
- The problem?
- 87-year-old male...

06:51.227 --> 06:54.390
...septic, with cholangitis.
He's on mezlo and Flagyl.

06:54.597 --> 06:56.462
I got his pressure up with dopamine.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.658
He's too sick for open surgery.
We'll do a decompression.

06:59.869 --> 07:02.269
- I booked the O.R.
- Busy night last night?

07:02.472 --> 07:06.408
Oh, God, horrible!
Twelve admissions, plus this one.

07:06.609 --> 07:10.045
I got an abdominal aortic aneurysm,
stab wound to the chest...

07:10.246 --> 07:14.012
...fall from a second-story balcony.
They just kept coming.

07:14.217 --> 07:16.651
I worked 36-hour shifts
as an intern in England.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.185
This makes me realize
how long ago that was.

07:19.922 --> 07:22.948
I'll take him down,
and we'll round at 8, okay?

07:23.292 --> 07:27.786
Lovely. Gives me enough time
for prerounds...

07:28.397 --> 07:29.386
...and a shower.

07:30.266 --> 07:33.360
You know, I bumped into
David Kotlowitz an hour ago.

07:34.003 --> 07:35.265
He's a terrific ENT.

07:35.471 --> 07:37.996
He's done a lot of work
with cochlear implants.

07:39.509 --> 07:40.737
Did you tell him about Reece?

07:41.477 --> 07:45.379
No, I just told him I had a friend
in need of talk on the subject.

07:45.581 --> 07:48.812
Don't solicit medical advice
on my behalf, all right?

07:49.118 --> 07:51.882
I worked with Kotlowitz.
That's why I brought it up.

07:52.088 --> 07:53.851
- Lf you'd rather I hadn't...
- Yeah.

07:54.056 --> 07:55.785
Fine, forget about it.

07:59.595 --> 08:01.825
- What is that? A sternal saw?
- Yes, it is.

08:02.031 --> 08:05.125
- What's it doing here?
- My midline thoracotomy proposal...

08:05.334 --> 08:08.235
...sailed through
the Human Subjects Committee.

08:08.437 --> 08:09.426
Nobody told me.

08:09.639 --> 08:12.904
Well, I'm certified to use it,
so we're up and running.

08:13.109 --> 08:15.634
I thought we'd talk
before it got underway.

08:15.845 --> 08:17.574
Surgeons use it on odd days...

08:17.780 --> 08:21.978
...ER docs get it on evens.
Your turn's tomorrow.

08:24.420 --> 08:25.546
Hey, bad news.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.586
We're still not pregnant.

08:27.790 --> 08:29.223
We'll redouble our efforts.

08:29.425 --> 08:31.723
If it's more
than three times a week...

08:31.928 --> 08:36.261
...we get diminishing returns.
Like reusing the same tea bag.

08:36.465 --> 08:39.696
- There's a romantic idea.
- Wasn't very romantic, was it?

08:39.902 --> 08:40.890
Doug?

08:41.102 --> 08:44.937
I've got a lethargic infant
not eating. You better come see him.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.771
- You okay?
- Yeah.

08:53.449 --> 08:54.780
Baby's name is Sun? Korean?

08:54.984 --> 08:57.817
Actually, it's Sun.
His mom's a little different.

08:59.088 --> 09:02.717
All right, Mrs. Everly. I'm Dr. Ross.

09:02.925 --> 09:03.983
Can I take a look at Sun?

09:04.193 --> 09:06.423
I don't know what's wrong.
He won't nurse.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.494
We'll figure it out.

09:08.698 --> 09:11.292
Hey, you his big sister?
What's your name?

09:11.500 --> 09:13.900
- Sky. Hello, doctor.
- Well, hello, Sky.

09:14.103 --> 09:15.502
Sun and Sky, huh?

09:16.372 --> 09:17.930
He was fine until a few days ago.

09:18.574 --> 09:21.008
Then I noticed he wasn't nursing
so well.

09:21.711 --> 09:26.239
- Any solid foods or formula?
- Oh, no. Only my milk.

09:26.449 --> 09:28.508
My breasts are engorged
with him not eating.

09:28.718 --> 09:30.276
When was the last time he pooped?

09:30.486 --> 09:34.752
- Oh, man. When?
- Yesterday morning.

09:37.326 --> 09:40.454
- You sure?
- Yes, I haven't changed him since.

09:40.830 --> 09:44.960
We'll hydrate him. Give him
50 cc's of D5 saline.

09:45.167 --> 09:46.828
We'll have to do blood tests.

09:47.036 --> 09:49.766
And I need your consent
to do a spinal tap.

09:49.972 --> 09:52.964
You stick a needle into his spine?
Won't that hurt?

09:53.175 --> 09:54.665
We'll sedate him, no pain.

09:54.877 --> 09:57.869
- Mom, it's gonna be okay.
- Do you think so, honey?

10:01.384 --> 10:02.783
We'll be right back, okay?

10:04.620 --> 10:08.181
Get a CBC, Chem-20 and blood cultures.
Can you assist with the LP?

10:08.391 --> 10:09.824
Sure, how do you sedate him?

10:10.026 --> 10:11.721
Propafol.
I'll get it from Pedes.

10:11.927 --> 10:14.555
General anesthesia?
Have we done that in the ER?

10:14.764 --> 10:18.461
First time for everything.
I'll take the proper precautions.

10:20.069 --> 10:23.038
Yelling doesn't help!
There's an ambulance out front.

10:23.239 --> 10:25.002
- Thank God!
- Don't open that door.

10:25.207 --> 10:26.196
Get away from me!

10:26.409 --> 10:28.934
- Come on!
- Get away from me! Don't touch me!

10:29.145 --> 10:31.113
- Yes, hello.
- We got a 911 call.

10:31.314 --> 10:33.145
- I called.
- She shouldn't have called.

10:33.349 --> 10:34.179
Get in here!

10:34.383 --> 10:37.875
- Where's the injured man?
- This is not an emergency.

10:38.087 --> 10:40.920
Everything's fine.
I don't need the hospital.

10:41.123 --> 10:42.784
- Your name?
- Richard Weingarten.

10:42.992 --> 10:46.052
He let this lunatic drill
a hole in his head.

10:46.262 --> 10:48.958
I'm an emergency physician.
Let me take a look.

10:49.165 --> 10:52.601
- I'm all right.
- Okay, just sit down here. Sit down.

10:52.802 --> 10:55.293
What are you ashamed of?

10:55.538 --> 10:57.802
- What happened?
- It's called trepanation.

10:58.007 --> 11:03.104
It's a centuries-old practice, a means
of increasing brain blood volume.

11:03.312 --> 11:06.042
- I had mine done in Amsterdam in 1968.
- Oh, God!

11:06.248 --> 11:08.739
It was like God lifted
a weight from me.

11:08.951 --> 11:10.043
It's a surgical drill.

11:10.820 --> 11:12.014
We're going to the hospital.

11:12.221 --> 11:16.248
You can't take me against my will.
I've studied this for years.

11:16.459 --> 11:18.154
I didn't embark on it lightly.

11:18.361 --> 11:21.558
Let us at least put a bandage on
and get a blood pressure.

11:22.898 --> 11:26.698
Okay, sir, just sign this.
It says you refuse treatment.

11:26.902 --> 11:28.733
Go to the rig and get some saline.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.736
- Come on, Rich. We did it.
- The Internet!

11:31.941 --> 11:34.375
That's what started this whole thing!

11:34.577 --> 11:35.566
- Laura!
- I hate it!

11:35.778 --> 11:37.575
- Get her outside.
- I hate it!

11:37.780 --> 11:39.145
- What are you doing?
- Outside!

11:39.348 --> 11:41.213
- I don't want to go!
- Calm down!

11:41.417 --> 11:45.478
I'll have you brought up on charges.
I want to go back inside!

11:47.390 --> 11:49.119
You're an intelligent person.

11:49.325 --> 11:51.384
I don't want to take you
against your will.

11:51.594 --> 11:52.583
I had to do something.

11:54.163 --> 11:55.653
All right. Okay.

11:57.433 --> 11:59.424
Doesn't look like you
penetrated the dura.

12:00.269 --> 12:04.535
All I want to do is put a sterile
dressing on to clean the wound.

12:04.740 --> 12:07.300
I'll leave you some saline
and gauze so you...

12:07.510 --> 12:09.671
...or your friend, can keep it clean.

12:09.879 --> 12:12.006
I forgot to bring any gauze.

12:14.550 --> 12:16.916
I've held enough screaming
babies to know.

12:17.119 --> 12:18.381
They have to be sedated.

12:18.587 --> 12:19.576
Doug?

12:19.989 --> 12:21.581
How you doing?

12:21.791 --> 12:23.918
You can't administer propafol
to an infant.

12:24.126 --> 12:26.060
You've done it upstairs for 10 years.

12:26.262 --> 12:28.628
You're not an anesthesiologist.

12:28.831 --> 12:30.594
I didn't think you'd have a problem.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.791
Well, I do.

12:33.569 --> 12:36.663
I have him on a cardiac monitor,
pulse ox, dynamap...

12:36.872 --> 12:37.930
...and a crash cart.

12:38.140 --> 12:41.371
You cannot just make up policy
as you go along.

12:41.577 --> 12:44.478
I'm trying to prevent pain,
do what's best for this boy.

12:44.680 --> 12:48.844
If you want to discuss policy, leave.
We'll do it later.

12:49.485 --> 12:50.679
We will.

12:57.793 --> 13:00.353
Dr. Carter, want to grab lunch later?

13:00.563 --> 13:03.930
Let's see. Tell me about
this patient in Curtain 3.

13:04.133 --> 13:06.601
Thirty-year-old male with pain
on urination.

13:06.802 --> 13:09.965
- The UA is negative for white cells.
- Chlamydia.

13:10.306 --> 13:11.295
Do a sexual history?

13:11.507 --> 13:14.169
He had two partners last year,
and used condoms.

13:14.376 --> 13:17.504
So he claims. Send up a DNA probe
and treat empirically.

13:17.713 --> 13:18.805
Treatment for chlamydia?

13:19.014 --> 13:21.778
Doxycycline BID,
or a dose of Zithromax.

13:21.984 --> 13:23.645
You should look at his chart...

13:23.853 --> 13:26.617
- Hi, I'm Dr. Carter.
- Hey.

13:26.822 --> 13:29.222
I need to ask,
do you always use condoms?

13:29.458 --> 13:30.891
Pretty much, yeah.

13:31.093 --> 13:32.890
There's times where you haven't?

13:33.896 --> 13:35.761
Once or twice maybe, yeah.

13:36.632 --> 13:39.465
That's all it takes.
We're gonna give you antibiotics.

13:39.668 --> 13:42.501
I think you have a common
infection called chlamydia.

13:42.705 --> 13:43.694
What, VD?

13:43.906 --> 13:45.703
Sexually transmitted disease, yes.

13:45.908 --> 13:47.239
She doesn't think so.

13:49.211 --> 13:53.944
He also had conjunctivitis and
arthralgias at the knee and ankle.

13:57.453 --> 13:59.614
Mr. Bussey, excuse us for a moment.

14:01.290 --> 14:03.349
He was in Mexico and had diarrhea.

14:03.559 --> 14:06.289
The timing and symptoms
are classic for Reiter's.

14:06.495 --> 14:08.963
- You could've included that.
- You cut me off.

14:09.164 --> 14:11.962
- You could've said, "Reiter's."
- I didn't get a word in. You...

14:12.167 --> 14:14.965
- I'm always doing what?
- Like now, you're defensive.

14:15.170 --> 14:16.797
You don't even hear me.

14:19.808 --> 14:22.868
So, what's the treatment
for Reiter's Syndrome?

14:24.213 --> 14:25.305
Indomethacin.

14:26.048 --> 14:29.984
- We can still send off for chlamydia...
- No, you're right. It's Reiter's.

14:30.219 --> 14:31.914
Good pickup, Lucy.

14:34.590 --> 14:38.720
Propafol is ideal for use in the ER.

14:38.928 --> 14:42.193
First of all, onset is immediate,
and it wears off in...

14:42.398 --> 14:45.026
Don't you think a doctor
should be trained?

14:45.234 --> 14:49.671
Got a gunshot to the chest coming.
The saw is sterilized in Trauma 1.

14:49.872 --> 14:52.363
We need to be ready
if this guy qualifies.

14:52.575 --> 14:55.305
You'll document 10 critical times.
Clock starts when?

14:55.511 --> 14:56.944
Soon as the patient enters.

14:57.146 --> 15:00.274
Don't they need to have
cardiac arrest? He sounded okay.

15:00.482 --> 15:02.541
Patients can deteriorate en route.

15:02.751 --> 15:04.981
Forty-six-year-old man shot
with a BB gun.

15:05.187 --> 15:07.052
- Hemodynamically stable.
- A BB gun?

15:07.256 --> 15:10.487
The punk who shot me needs to be
put under the jail.

15:10.693 --> 15:14.151
Ten years old or not.
Let me up off of this, I can walk.

15:14.363 --> 15:16.490
- Let him go.
- Doesn't need a thoracotomy.

15:16.699 --> 15:21.432
- No, a tetanus shot and a Band-Aid.
- You can follow me, sir.

15:21.637 --> 15:25.403
- Want to turn around, or can we hang?
- No, take 10 minutes.

15:26.742 --> 15:29.540
Hey, Carol. What's going on?

15:30.446 --> 15:32.505
Just doing a quick blood draw.

15:32.781 --> 15:35.045
So how's the clinic going today?

15:35.250 --> 15:39.380
Oh, I just love prenatal days.
Takes me back to my OB roots.

15:39.588 --> 15:41.283
Why don't you let a nurse do that?

15:41.690 --> 15:43.521
Because I was trying to be discreet.

15:43.726 --> 15:46.752
Let me do it. It's kind of hard
to stick yourself.

15:46.962 --> 15:47.792
Thanks.

15:47.997 --> 15:49.692
What labs you need?

15:50.699 --> 15:54.760
Just a CBC, check if I'm anemic.

15:54.970 --> 15:57.302
Oh, I only ask
because if you'd like...

15:57.506 --> 16:01.567
...I can run the results through
the clinic. Be more private.

16:01.777 --> 16:02.766
That's a great idea.

16:05.547 --> 16:08.414
What I'd really like is
to check my hormone levels.

16:08.617 --> 16:10.881
Oh, okay. Infertility workup?

16:11.120 --> 16:14.180
- I don't want to discuss details.
- I wasn't trying to...

16:14.390 --> 16:17.291
It'd be great if you
run it through the clinic.

16:17.493 --> 16:18.790
- Okay.
- Thanks.

16:27.870 --> 16:32.500
Mark, glad I caught you.
I've had to move my surgical schedule.

16:32.708 --> 16:34.801
Dr. Lee's interview is pushed to 1:30.

16:35.010 --> 16:36.807
- Is that a problem?
- No, that's fine.

16:37.012 --> 16:39.412
- Have you looked at her CV?
- Impressive.

16:39.615 --> 16:43.051
If she's half as impressive in person,
she might be our next Chief.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.844
And not a moment too soon.

16:45.054 --> 16:48.046
Dr. Greene, I didn't think you
were gonna be around.

16:48.257 --> 16:52.557
I was on a paramedic ride-along,
and we brought in a patient.

16:52.761 --> 16:56.219
So, you finish your student
evaluation yet?

16:56.432 --> 16:58.263
I thought I had till the shift ends?

16:59.068 --> 17:01.195
No big deal, this afternoon's fine.

17:01.970 --> 17:04.097
I wrote an evaluation for Lucy...

17:04.306 --> 17:07.036
...but I tore it up because
I want to be fair.

17:07.242 --> 17:10.108
You put something on paper
that'll impact her life.

17:10.945 --> 17:12.310
Just evaluate her work.

17:14.983 --> 17:16.415
What are you talking about?

17:16.617 --> 17:18.813
I'm talking about your porn-star name.

17:19.021 --> 17:22.422
Take your pet's name
and your mother's maiden name.

17:22.624 --> 17:26.060
- Try it. Like mine is Rex Voytek.
- Oh, I know that game.

17:26.261 --> 17:28.058
But it's your drag name, not porn.

17:28.697 --> 17:30.927
- Drag name?
- Yeah, the name of your pet...

17:31.133 --> 17:34.000
...and the street you're born on.
- I don't think so.

17:34.203 --> 17:36.171
RuPaul had it on her show.

17:36.505 --> 17:38.769
Leave some crumbs for the rest of us.

17:38.974 --> 17:41.408
- Are you the cookie police?
- Have some...

17:41.610 --> 17:43.840
...but I brought those for
the docs and nurses.

17:44.046 --> 17:46.514
- So you're the cookie fairy.
- Wait a minute.

17:46.715 --> 17:48.649
- Don't worry.
- Bad enough you raid...

17:48.851 --> 17:50.876
...the icebox, now you
want to call names?

17:51.086 --> 17:53.054
Conni, you begrudge us some juice?

17:53.255 --> 17:54.984
It's not like you bring anything in.

17:55.190 --> 17:59.183
You should thank me for the cookie
I keep from your fat snack hole.

18:00.629 --> 18:02.221
You just keep talking, Morales.

18:03.499 --> 18:06.366
- Hey, what's going on?
- That one's got a problem.

18:06.568 --> 18:09.036
- You antagonizing them?
- He called Yosh a fairy.

18:09.238 --> 18:12.207
I called him the cookie fairy.
It was a dumb joke.

18:12.407 --> 18:14.238
A real dumb joke.
Ready to head back?

18:14.443 --> 18:15.740
Yeah, let's go.

18:20.816 --> 18:23.046
I got no problem with him
being a bone-smoker.

18:23.252 --> 18:25.550
I was joking like I would
with anybody.

18:25.754 --> 18:27.449
Don't worry about it.

18:27.656 --> 18:29.556
Write the discharge orders soon.

18:29.758 --> 18:33.319
- Bed Control likes them by 12 noon.
- Yes, I am aware of that.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.828
I told you I'd have a hard time
seeing you as my intern.

18:37.032 --> 18:39.000
It's complicated for a lot of reasons.

18:39.234 --> 18:42.067
Dr. Corday, Mr. Frybush's
creatinine is much higher.

18:42.271 --> 18:44.432
Thank you.
Shall we call a renal consult?

18:44.640 --> 18:46.267
Yeah, this guy needs dialysis.

18:46.475 --> 18:50.502
- So did you ever get that shower?
- No, can you tell?

18:50.712 --> 18:52.805
Well, go ahead. I'll cover SICU.

18:53.015 --> 18:55.882
- I don't want special treatment.
- Turning down a shower?

18:56.084 --> 18:59.076
- I've got a lot of work.
- Okay, have it your way.

18:59.288 --> 19:02.382
Gotta go find Weaver.
She's itching to use that saw.

19:02.591 --> 19:04.889
Going to the roach coach.
Want something?

19:05.093 --> 19:08.290
Yes, a triple espresso.
Thank you, Kit.

19:08.497 --> 19:09.657
Elizabeth?

19:09.865 --> 19:13.232
How would you like to scrub in
on a bilateral adrenalectomy?

19:13.435 --> 19:17.337
Oh, I appreciate the offer,
but I'm postcall.

19:17.539 --> 19:20.531
I gotta finish my work,
and I have to catch up on sleep.

19:20.742 --> 19:23.006
A case like this comes
once in a blue moon.

19:23.212 --> 19:26.511
I'm up to my neck in ER garbage,
but I'm not passing this up.

19:27.449 --> 19:30.316
Well, it's been a while since
my last adrenalectomy.

19:30.519 --> 19:32.248
I'll do right, you do left.

19:32.921 --> 19:35.549
I can get Dr. Kennedy to cover
your service.

19:36.258 --> 19:40.058
Jeanie? The baby's spinal tap
came back negative for meningitis.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.456
What's going on?

19:41.663 --> 19:43.324
A lot. We got to talk to the mom.

19:43.532 --> 19:46.797
I'll take Sky out of the room.
She doesn't need to hear all this.

19:47.002 --> 19:48.026
Good idea.

19:48.237 --> 19:51.035
Her mom leans on her a lot,
don't you think?

19:51.240 --> 19:53.674
- A smart kid, though.
- Yeah.

19:54.042 --> 19:55.839
Okay. Hey.

19:56.044 --> 19:58.638
- What did you find?
- Spinal tap was negative.

19:59.248 --> 20:03.309
I have more questions. Maybe
Jeanie and Sky could take a walk.

20:03.518 --> 20:05.884
I don't want to worry
about her wandering.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.116
I'd rather stay here with Mom.

20:08.323 --> 20:11.451
Can she help me put
some toys away while you talk?

20:11.660 --> 20:13.355
It's a good idea.

20:13.795 --> 20:15.956
- Mind helping me?
- I don't mind.

20:16.164 --> 20:17.563
I'll be right back, Mom.

20:17.766 --> 20:19.791
- See what toys we can find.
- Sure.

20:20.569 --> 20:24.335
Okay, we need to see if
we can figure out...

20:24.539 --> 20:26.234
...the cause of Sun's deterioration.

20:26.441 --> 20:29.638
- Now, has he had a polio vaccine?
- Oh, God, polio!

20:30.345 --> 20:32.506
He was vaccinated. Is that effective?

20:33.582 --> 20:34.913
Do you have a doll at home?

20:35.684 --> 20:37.481
- No.
- No, really?

20:38.253 --> 20:41.086
I had one. Dolls are for babies.
I'm a big girl.

20:42.524 --> 20:45.254
- And how old are you?
- Six.

20:46.028 --> 20:47.086
Six.

20:52.167 --> 20:55.728
After the adrenal vein, we'll work
our way around the medial...

20:55.938 --> 20:58.031
...and inferior edges of the gland.

20:58.607 --> 21:01.542
Cut, please. And another tie.

21:03.178 --> 21:04.145
Elizabeth, cut.

21:06.448 --> 21:08.075
Elizabeth?

21:09.084 --> 21:10.381
Sorry. Yes.

21:11.386 --> 21:13.946
You do need a rest.
Why don't you step out?

21:14.523 --> 21:15.854
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

21:16.058 --> 21:17.423
Go take a nap.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.952
Sorry I dragged you along.

21:24.967 --> 21:26.332
Dr. Goodman?

21:32.040 --> 21:34.508
- Can I run something by you?
- Make it quick.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.803
Male with aphasia and arm weakness.

21:37.012 --> 21:39.947
CT scan was normal.
Spinal fluid is clear.

21:40.148 --> 21:42.582
I'm thinking vasculitis or MS?

21:42.784 --> 21:46.686
Send off a sed rate
and a complement level in the CSF.

21:46.888 --> 21:50.255
Look at the differential. May be some
zebras you haven't considered.

21:50.459 --> 21:53.155
Okay. Hey, Yosh, is that
Lucy's palmtop?

21:53.362 --> 21:55.159
I love this. She let me borrow it.

21:55.364 --> 21:58.765
- Can I use it? When you're done.
- I'm done.

21:59.668 --> 22:01.067
Here you go.

22:02.270 --> 22:05.262
- Know how to work it?
- Yeah, Lucy showed me once.

22:07.409 --> 22:10.572
<i>I'd hoped to avoid this.</i>
<i>But things haven't improved.</i>

22:10.779 --> 22:15.216
<i>I don't know how I'm supposed to</i>
<i>learn in this hostile environment.</i>

22:15.450 --> 22:18.248
<i>Our relationship has turned</i>
<i>completely adversarial...</i>

22:18.453 --> 22:20.944
<i>... and it's not good</i>
<i>for the patients.</i>

22:21.223 --> 22:22.747
<i>We need to talk.</i>

22:22.958 --> 22:25.119
This crazy bastard lets Dr. Greene...

22:25.327 --> 22:27.420
...Iook inside the hole
with a penlight.

22:27.629 --> 22:29.893
- Unbelievable!
- I thought I'd seen it all.

22:30.098 --> 22:32.191
Doc writes him a scrip
for antibiotics.

22:32.401 --> 22:33.800
The guy thanks us for coming.

22:34.002 --> 22:36.630
Yeah, I've got a way
with ranting lunatics.

22:36.838 --> 22:39.966
- I ain't kidding. You do.
- Hey, what's up, guys?

22:40.175 --> 22:42.370
- We're all here.
- You're not on today.

22:42.577 --> 22:45.375
Truth is, they're here because
we got you something.

22:45.680 --> 22:46.669
You like it?

22:49.718 --> 22:52.516
- It's great.
- You're one of the gang now.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.687
- Almost.
- Almost?

22:57.893 --> 22:59.622
There's something every
paramedic does.

22:59.828 --> 23:02.661
It's only appropriate
that you do too.

23:02.864 --> 23:07.494
How many patients have you brought in
strapped to a backboard with a collar?

23:07.702 --> 23:08.862
What do you have in mind?

23:09.071 --> 23:11.096
Come over to the table,
we'll show you.

23:11.306 --> 23:14.935
As a part of our training,
we all get on the board ourselves.

23:15.143 --> 23:16.610
You want me to lie on the board.

23:16.812 --> 23:18.279
Don't worry. We all did it.

23:18.480 --> 23:21.074
- Comes with the coat.
- Gotta drop your pants.

23:21.283 --> 23:23.148
No, he doesn't!

23:23.819 --> 23:26.811
Forget about that part, guys.
All right? Forget it.

23:27.022 --> 23:29.013
I have to get back to the hospital.

23:29.224 --> 23:31.192
Then don't fight. Just lie down.

23:31.393 --> 23:32.917
- Come on.
- Relax, guys, back off.

23:33.128 --> 23:34.618
Let him do it on his own.

23:34.830 --> 23:35.819
You want me to lie down.

23:38.700 --> 23:40.895
- There.
- There you go.

23:41.103 --> 23:42.195
Get him!

23:42.404 --> 23:43.530
Got the shower on?

23:43.738 --> 23:47.572
- Come on, the shower's on!
- Get the shower!

23:50.345 --> 23:52.210
Stop it! Stop it!

23:52.414 --> 23:53.711
Take it easy, doc.

23:53.915 --> 23:55.746
Hey, guys, guys. Come on.

23:55.951 --> 23:57.077
Let him up.

23:58.386 --> 24:01.878
- Let him up.
- We weren't gonna hurt you.

24:02.090 --> 24:03.284
Much.

24:06.595 --> 24:08.495
It's all over for now.

24:14.269 --> 24:16.760
Jer, know what your name is
as a porn star?

24:16.972 --> 24:18.200
That game is tired.

24:18.406 --> 24:22.536
- I've got the best, Satan Monroe.
- Your mother's maiden name is Satan?

24:22.744 --> 24:25.508
- Carol, I need you.
- What's wrong?

24:25.714 --> 24:29.241
Young woman complains of severe
right lower quadrant pain.

24:29.451 --> 24:31.510
Pregnancy test positive,
a possible ectopic.

24:31.720 --> 24:32.709
- Name?
- Maria Jones.

24:32.921 --> 24:35.754
Five pregnancies.
Two live births, two abortions.

24:36.191 --> 24:37.385
Hi, Maria.

24:37.592 --> 24:38.854
We're gonna take care of you.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.756
- It hurts, it hurts!
- All right.

24:43.098 --> 24:47.762
Let's get a CBC, Beta HCG, Chem-20.

24:48.537 --> 24:51.870
Type and cross two units,
and start a line of saline.

24:52.073 --> 24:55.065
- Did you do a pelvic?
- No, she's in too much pain.

24:55.277 --> 24:58.303
She said I'm pregnant.
Is my baby okay?

24:58.513 --> 25:00.003
Okay.

25:01.183 --> 25:03.617
Let's do an ultrasound
while we're at it.

25:05.287 --> 25:07.847
It just hurts so bad!

25:08.056 --> 25:10.524
Okay, you're gonna be fine.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.427
Sorry I'm late.

25:13.628 --> 25:18.031
We were just about to start
without you. Dr. Lee, Mark Greene.

25:18.233 --> 25:19.257
Sorry if I held things up.

25:19.467 --> 25:21.628
I'll try not to take it personally.

25:21.836 --> 25:24.862
You've been flexible with your time.
We appreciate it.

25:25.073 --> 25:27.837
- I'm happy to be here.
- Let's get right to it.

25:28.310 --> 25:30.870
"Three years as associate chief.

25:31.079 --> 25:35.106
Excellence in Clinical Teaching Award
two years in a row."

25:36.384 --> 25:38.852
How do you think you can improve
our department?

25:39.054 --> 25:43.115
You could benefit from an eight-bed
observation unit for 23-hour stays.

25:43.325 --> 25:45.953
Paid for how?
We're a cash-poor county hospital.

25:46.161 --> 25:49.858
- That's why you need it.
- Tell us more.

25:50.065 --> 25:51.794
I set up a unit like it in Atlanta.

25:52.000 --> 25:56.869
And it saved the hospital $2 million
a year in unnecessary admissions.

25:57.072 --> 25:59.666
What kind of patients
are we talking about?

26:00.108 --> 26:02.406
- Lucy, take this.
- What is it?

26:02.611 --> 26:04.203
Your evaluation.

26:04.412 --> 26:05.401
It's blank.

26:05.614 --> 26:08.777
You fill it out since you think
I'm so adversarial.

26:08.984 --> 26:12.317
And keep track of this
before someone walks away with it.

26:12.520 --> 26:13.646
You listened to my notes?

26:13.855 --> 26:16.085
You're so sure I'd give you
a bad evaluation...

26:16.291 --> 26:19.419
...you're planning a countermove.
A hostile workplace?

26:19.628 --> 26:21.357
I didn't know it's time
for evaluation.

26:21.563 --> 26:23.861
Please. Why'd you want to have lunch?

26:24.065 --> 26:25.828
To get things out in the open.

26:26.034 --> 26:27.968
Well, they're out in the open.

26:28.169 --> 26:32.606
Why don't you fill that out, and let's
see how fair-minded you can be.

26:35.810 --> 26:39.803
- How long will they be upstairs?
- Not much longer.

26:40.015 --> 26:42.040
What was the name of the doll you had?

26:42.250 --> 26:45.048
- Baby.
- Was Baby a boy or a girl?

26:45.253 --> 26:46.948
She wasn't a boy or a girl.

26:47.155 --> 26:49.248
She didn't have a penis or a vagina.

26:53.094 --> 26:56.029
- What are you doing?
- Letting him lick the spoon.

26:57.399 --> 26:59.094
Does your brother lick the spoon?

26:59.301 --> 27:01.531
Sometimes, with things that he likes.

27:01.736 --> 27:04.261
- Like what? Yogurt?
- Sun doesn't like yogurt.

27:04.472 --> 27:06.940
- What does he like?
- Lots of things.

27:08.677 --> 27:09.666
Does he like honey?

27:11.179 --> 27:13.841
Your little brother licks honey
off of your spoon?

27:14.182 --> 27:16.582
- He likes it.
- Okay.

27:16.785 --> 27:19.310
Sky, let's go find your mom
and Dr. Ross, okay?

27:20.322 --> 27:21.311
Okay.

27:21.523 --> 27:23.991
- I like the observation unit idea.
- Good.

27:24.559 --> 27:26.754
- Very good presentation.
- Thank you.

27:26.961 --> 27:29.191
I'd be happy to give you
a tour of the ER.

27:29.397 --> 27:30.796
I don't need to be hand-held.

27:30.999 --> 27:32.762
But I do want to walk around.

27:32.967 --> 27:35.162
Feel free. I'll catch up with you.

27:35.370 --> 27:36.735
It's a pleasure.

27:38.373 --> 27:41.968
- Mark, do you like her?
- She's good.

27:42.177 --> 27:44.737
You didn't say much.
Didn't think you're impressed.

27:44.946 --> 27:47.073
I'd like to continue this
in a less formal setting.

27:47.282 --> 27:49.079
I'll see if she can come for dinner.

27:49.284 --> 27:51.047
- Would you be...?
- I can't tonight.

27:51.252 --> 27:54.221
I'm sorry. Excuse me, Dr. Anspaugh.

27:55.156 --> 27:57.317
- Are you feeling better?
- A little bit.

27:57.525 --> 27:59.516
Going to the bathroom helped, huh?

27:59.728 --> 28:01.286
Maybe it was just gas pains.

28:01.496 --> 28:03.862
You haven't had any bleeding,
which is good.

28:04.065 --> 28:08.126
You're further along than we thought.
Looks like 15 weeks.

28:08.336 --> 28:11.237
- I wasn't even sure I was pregnant.
- Look.

28:14.008 --> 28:16.533
Can you tell? Is it a boy or a girl?

28:17.445 --> 28:21.313
Can't say for sure.
It looks like a girl.

28:21.516 --> 28:23.677
After having two boys, that'd be nice.

28:25.019 --> 28:26.543
Well, I don't see a penis.

28:26.755 --> 28:28.552
You can't always tell
on an ultrasound.

28:28.757 --> 28:30.486
You'll have to come back...

28:30.692 --> 28:32.819
...make sure she stays healthy.

28:33.261 --> 28:34.523
I'll do that.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.394
Come on, Corday.

28:43.838 --> 28:45.499
Pull yourself together.

28:45.707 --> 28:48.232
It's just a few more hours to go.

29:02.924 --> 29:04.448
Elizabeth, can you do me a favor?

29:04.659 --> 29:07.150
Watch the service?
I've gotta see Dr. Kotlowitz.

29:07.362 --> 29:09.922
- Really?
- Yeah, I ran into him.

29:10.532 --> 29:12.397
Actually, I went looking for him.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.534
Peter, that's terrific. Yes, go!

29:14.736 --> 29:17.432
- I can cover service.
- Thanks.

29:22.544 --> 29:24.478
I need orders on a new admission.

29:24.679 --> 29:26.169
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

29:26.381 --> 29:30.215
- No, Mr. Ramos is back.
- Ramos? Fem-pop bypass?

29:30.418 --> 29:31.646
I discharged him yesterday.

29:32.120 --> 29:34.816
He's back with an infection
and an asthma attack.

29:35.423 --> 29:37.823
- You know the rules.
- Yep, I know. He's mine.

29:38.026 --> 29:40.153
He's on continuous albuterol.

29:41.329 --> 29:43.194
Hello, Mr. Ramos.

29:43.398 --> 29:45.593
Let's take a look at your legs.

29:45.800 --> 29:47.631
I was hoping you'd be here today.

29:48.336 --> 29:51.100
Oh, where else would I possibly go?

29:51.806 --> 29:54.172
I asked the mom if she'd given
the baby food.

29:54.375 --> 29:55.899
Guess I talked to the wrong person.

29:56.110 --> 29:58.374
The baby's lucky.
We can treat botulism.

29:58.580 --> 30:00.946
- But what do we do to help Sky?
- She's fine.

30:01.149 --> 30:02.673
Her mom's draining her childhood.

30:02.917 --> 30:06.683
As much neglect and abuse as I see,
trust me, Sky is okay.

30:06.888 --> 30:10.551
- She needs to be a little girl.
- Yeah, that's true.

30:10.758 --> 30:14.455
Hey, guys. Okay, now...

30:15.129 --> 30:17.029
...you can't give honey
to your brother...

30:17.232 --> 30:19.962
...or to any baby
because it can hurt them.

30:20.168 --> 30:21.931
Honey can have botulism spores.

30:22.136 --> 30:26.197
Their intestines are immature,
and they can't kill off the spores.

30:26.407 --> 30:28.534
He's maxed out with a pressure of 65.

30:28.743 --> 30:32.702
Systemic resistance is 3500.
Let's start Levophed.

30:32.914 --> 30:36.008
Dr. Corday, I need you here.
Mr. Ramos is pretty tight.

30:37.752 --> 30:38.912
You okay?

30:39.120 --> 30:41.247
Yep, I'm fine.

30:43.558 --> 30:46.459
- How much albuterol?
- Twenty an hour.

30:46.661 --> 30:49.528
- He's had Solu-Medrol.
- 125 in the ER.

30:49.731 --> 30:52.393
- Okay, I'll push some magnesium.
- Magnesium?

30:52.600 --> 30:55.933
It relaxes the smooth muscles
of the bronchioles.

30:56.137 --> 30:57.627
Can you look at Mr. Frybush?

30:57.839 --> 30:59.739
Give me five minutes, okay?

30:59.941 --> 31:02.273
Carter, can you explain
this evaluation?

31:02.477 --> 31:04.741
If it's this bad,
you should've come to me.

31:04.946 --> 31:06.538
Do you have something against her?

31:06.748 --> 31:09.114
- Wait a sec...
- I want to see you and Lucy.

31:09.317 --> 31:12.115
We're gonna figure this out.
Find her and then me.

31:12.320 --> 31:14.345
- Can I hang on to that?
- No!

31:16.824 --> 31:18.485
Sound like you're in a good mood.

31:18.693 --> 31:21.025
Do me a favor?
I need a place to crash.

31:21.229 --> 31:23.356
Building's being fumigated.
Would Carol mind?

31:23.565 --> 31:26.090
- You kidding? Come over.
- Save me a few bucks.

31:26.301 --> 31:28.735
- Sure thing, glad to have you.
- Thanks.

31:28.937 --> 31:32.202
He's set up for another
four hours of continuous.

31:33.708 --> 31:36.176
Magnesium's on board.

31:36.544 --> 31:39.308
- How are you feeling, Mr. Ramos?
- Dizzy.

31:39.514 --> 31:42.415
- Whoa. What's happening?
- Maybe he's hypoxic.

31:42.617 --> 31:46.212
- How much mag did you give him?
- Two grams IV push, 40 cc's.

31:46.421 --> 31:48.048
Forty cc's of 50 percent mag?

31:48.256 --> 31:50.087
Not 50 percent! Five percent!

31:50.291 --> 31:52.452
No, Dr. Corday,
you gave him 50 percent.

31:54.028 --> 31:56.622
My God, you're right.
I gave him a lethal dose.

31:56.831 --> 31:58.662
- He's not breathing.
- ET tube!

31:58.866 --> 32:00.390
Bradying down. Heart rate's 30.

32:00.602 --> 32:03.867
Two grams calcium gluconate.
Push an amp of atropine.

32:06.541 --> 32:08.805
Bag him, prep for IJ.
I'll float a pacemaker.

32:09.010 --> 32:11.672
- Lost the pulse, in P.E.A.
- I'll start compressions.

32:11.879 --> 32:15.440
Seven and a half gloves and
8 French Cordis introducer.

32:20.521 --> 32:24.355
The cochlear implant is a miracle,
and the technology keeps improving.

32:24.559 --> 32:25.924
I'm impressed by what I read.

32:26.127 --> 32:28.152
Don't read.
Talk to people who have it.

32:28.363 --> 32:29.694
Talk to parents of kids...

32:29.897 --> 32:33.162
I can get you in touch with people
who faced the same.

32:33.368 --> 32:37.270
Great, I've already heard
an earful from the opponents, so...

32:37.472 --> 32:38.803
The fanatics.

32:39.007 --> 32:40.634
Well, they've got their agendas.

32:40.842 --> 32:45.142
The level of passion with which
these people attack you, it's bizarre.

32:45.346 --> 32:50.010
Someone used the word "genocidal."
Said I was eradicating deaf culture.

32:50.351 --> 32:52.512
Deafness is not
an alternative lifestyle.

32:52.720 --> 32:55.086
People who claim it is
are beyond reasoning with.

32:55.289 --> 32:56.984
The thing I figure is...

32:57.191 --> 33:00.092
...why make an argument against
hearing and speaking?

33:00.294 --> 33:04.287
Honestly, know what I think?
I think it comes down to laziness.

33:04.499 --> 33:06.296
A deaf person can function.

33:06.501 --> 33:08.696
But some people don't want
to exercise...

33:08.903 --> 33:10.837
...and do all the drills it takes.

33:11.039 --> 33:13.234
Look, it's years of hard work.

33:13.441 --> 33:15.875
Yeah, but they have the energy
to attack me.

33:16.077 --> 33:18.602
The hell with them.
Don't stand in my way...

33:18.813 --> 33:20.940
...when I'm trying to help a person
function.

33:22.884 --> 33:25.079
Why don't you tell me
how you really feel?

33:27.055 --> 33:31.754
Anyway, you bring in your son
and we'll see if he's a candidate.

33:33.027 --> 33:35.757
Do you work closely with Dr. Corday?

33:36.297 --> 33:38.231
Actually, she's my intern.

33:38.433 --> 33:41.163
She told me about the fallout
with Rocket Romano.

33:41.369 --> 33:42.358
Oh, yeah.

33:43.004 --> 33:45.131
Do you know if she's seeing anybody?

33:45.773 --> 33:47.206
I'm just wondering.

33:47.742 --> 33:50.540
I'm pretty sure
she's involved with somebody.

33:50.745 --> 33:52.212
- I'm not surprised.
- Yeah.

33:52.413 --> 33:53.573
- Oh, well.
- Thanks.

33:53.781 --> 33:56.045
You bet, anytime. Give me a call.

33:57.852 --> 33:58.841
Check, please.

34:00.154 --> 34:01.678
Systolic, 60 palp.

34:01.889 --> 34:05.154
Come on. Come on. Come on.

34:05.860 --> 34:09.626
We've got capture.
Turning the rate down to 80.

34:10.965 --> 34:12.431
- Did you page Dr. Benton?
- Done.

34:12.632 --> 34:13.964
- Pulse is stronger.
- Good.

34:14.168 --> 34:16.431
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

34:16.838 --> 34:18.168
That could be the atropine.

34:18.371 --> 34:20.203
That, or he stroked out.
What happened?

34:20.408 --> 34:23.571
I gave him enough magnesium
to cause a cardiac arrest.

34:23.777 --> 34:26.042
- Twenty grams.
- Oh, no.

34:26.246 --> 34:29.580
I looked at the label.
I thought it said 5 percent...

34:29.784 --> 34:33.311
...but it was 50 percent.
But I looked at the label.

34:35.223 --> 34:37.783
- I got your blood work back.
- Thanks, Lynette.

34:37.992 --> 34:41.428
Progesterone level's normal.
That's good news, you ovulated.

34:41.629 --> 34:44.427
I've been trying to get pregnant,
and I haven't.

34:44.632 --> 34:46.862
- How long have you been at it?
- Couple months.

34:47.068 --> 34:49.002
Give yourself at least six months...

34:49.203 --> 34:50.830
...before you start worrying.

34:51.038 --> 34:52.596
Yeah, you're right. I'm crazy.

34:52.806 --> 34:55.503
Maybe you guys need to increase
your activity.

34:55.710 --> 34:57.940
How often do you, you know, do the do?

34:58.146 --> 35:01.138
- What?
- Oh, sorry, am I being indiscreet?

35:01.682 --> 35:02.671
Carol, what's the deal?

35:02.884 --> 35:06.012
I went to see your ectopic.
She's dressed, ready to leave.

35:06.220 --> 35:08.745
- Maria Jones?
- She pulled her IV?

35:09.557 --> 35:11.286
Maria, where are you going?

35:11.492 --> 35:12.982
I feel better. I'm going home.

35:13.227 --> 35:16.196
You were in so much pain,
I couldn't examine you.

35:16.397 --> 35:18.627
- But I'm better now.
- But, wait.

35:18.833 --> 35:21.301
We need to make sure
everything's okay with you.

35:21.502 --> 35:23.561
Just let the doctor look you over.

35:23.771 --> 35:26.740
Look, I just wanted to know
if it was a boy or a girl.

35:26.941 --> 35:28.306
Nothing's wrong, so why worry?

35:28.509 --> 35:31.535
Wait! You were faking those
abdominal pains?

35:31.746 --> 35:34.738
- Are you crazy?
- You weren't sure you were pregnant.

35:34.949 --> 35:37.247
Why would you lie and cause
all that drama...

35:37.451 --> 35:39.749
...to find out if it's a boy or a...?

35:39.954 --> 35:42.616
- No, are you gonna abort this baby?
- Let go of me!

35:42.824 --> 35:45.349
- Carol!
- She's had two boys and two abortions.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.959
Are you getting rid of this child...?

35:47.161 --> 35:48.890
It's my baby and I'll do what I want.

35:49.096 --> 35:52.532
I told you that ultrasound
is inconclusive. It could be a boy!

35:52.733 --> 35:54.758
Lady, take your hands off of me.

35:54.969 --> 35:56.231
Carol, let her go.

35:56.437 --> 35:58.132
Girls are trouble anyhow.

35:58.339 --> 36:01.502
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with you?!

36:11.419 --> 36:14.786
How could you inject a patient
with 20 grams of magnesium?

36:14.989 --> 36:17.321
I make no excuses.
It was a grievous error.

36:18.526 --> 36:20.960
Where were you during this,
Dr. Benton?

36:21.162 --> 36:24.188
I was out of the hospital.
I came when I was paged.

36:24.398 --> 36:26.263
It wouldn't have mattered, anyway.

36:26.467 --> 36:28.901
You left your intern unsupervised.

36:29.103 --> 36:31.571
This patient may have suffered
brain injury.

36:31.772 --> 36:32.761
I stopped by the unit.

36:32.974 --> 36:35.272
Mr. Ramos' eyes are open,
and he's responding.

36:35.476 --> 36:37.341
You are not to leave while on duty.

36:37.545 --> 36:39.911
You are not to leave
your intern unsupervised.

36:41.148 --> 36:44.515
I know it's hard for us all to view
Elizabeth as an intern.

36:44.719 --> 36:48.246
But we've opened up this hospital
to enormous liability.

36:51.792 --> 36:55.660
I'll speak to Risk Management
and the hospital attorneys.

36:55.863 --> 36:59.299
They'll determine what information
to release to the families.

37:00.635 --> 37:03.604
Don't either of you discuss
this with anyone.

37:09.610 --> 37:12.170
Can we get together
and not talk about this?

37:12.380 --> 37:15.076
I have to pick up my son
from my sister's house.

37:15.283 --> 37:16.648
All right.

37:20.121 --> 37:22.248
You just need to get
a good night's sleep.

37:32.800 --> 37:34.267
I didn't fill this out.

37:34.468 --> 37:35.457
- Who did?
- She did.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.501
- Why did she?
- Because he told me to.

37:37.705 --> 37:40.503
I didn't say to give it to him,
I said to give it to me.

37:40.708 --> 37:42.676
- No, you didn't.
- Okay, wait.

37:43.277 --> 37:44.972
Don't talk to each other, talk to me.

37:45.179 --> 37:48.410
Mark, I wanted to know
how she thought she was doing...

37:49.383 --> 37:50.577
...before my final assessment.

37:50.785 --> 37:52.309
I tried to put myself
in his shoes...

37:52.520 --> 37:54.852
...and be critical.
He said, "fill it out"...

37:55.056 --> 37:57.923
...meaning "turn it in."
- How could she assume that?

37:59.193 --> 38:00.160
Makes no sense.

38:00.394 --> 38:03.056
That's part of his problem.
Incomplete directions.

38:03.264 --> 38:04.731
I give incomplete directions?

38:04.932 --> 38:06.422
- Name a time.
- Just one?

38:06.634 --> 38:08.761
Tell her to name a time
when I gave her...

38:08.970 --> 38:12.531
...incomplete directions.
- Okay, talk to each other.

38:12.740 --> 38:16.039
Don't talk to me.
Whatever this is, I can't fix it.

38:16.243 --> 38:18.837
Work it out, both of you.

38:21.949 --> 38:24.975
Kerry, I need to talk to you
about the x-ray report.

38:25.186 --> 38:26.414
Please don't blow me off.

38:26.620 --> 38:27.848
Sorry, trauma coming in.

38:28.055 --> 38:30.216
Possible candidate
for the thoracotomy study.

38:30.424 --> 38:31.584
I didn't know that's running.

38:31.792 --> 38:34.454
Stab wound to left chest.
Had a pulse in the field.

38:34.662 --> 38:37.825
Gave him epi, 1500 cc's of saline.
Shocked him twice.

38:38.032 --> 38:39.556
Great candidate. The stopwatch?

38:39.767 --> 38:40.961
Right here.

38:41.202 --> 38:42.191
You mind if I tag along?

38:42.870 --> 38:46.033
Now, start the timer. Here we go.

38:46.640 --> 38:50.303
On my count: One, two, three!

38:50.511 --> 38:52.274
Two units of O-neg on the infuser.

38:52.480 --> 38:55.506
Get type-specific as soon as you can.
Ten blade, let's go.

38:55.716 --> 38:57.581
Good breath sounds bilaterally.

38:57.785 --> 38:59.582
Seven and a half gloves.

39:01.889 --> 39:06.258
Okay, skin incision is complete.

39:06.660 --> 39:07.991
Mark the time. Saw, please.

39:24.512 --> 39:26.776
- Sternal retractor.
- Good job!

39:26.981 --> 39:29.449
- I need a purple top.
- Pulse ox 85.

39:29.650 --> 39:32.118
- Mark the time.
- Suction, please.

39:32.319 --> 39:35.948
Pickups and Metz.
Looks like blood in the pericardium.

39:36.157 --> 39:37.749
First hemoglobin is 9.2.

39:37.958 --> 39:40.290
Okay, pericardium is open.
Mark the time.

39:41.195 --> 39:43.186
I see a stab wound
to the left ventricle.

39:43.397 --> 39:45.524
- What are we at?
- Forty-two seconds.

39:45.733 --> 39:47.701
Take over internal compressions.

39:47.902 --> 39:49.460
Tamponade the wound. 2-O silk.

39:49.670 --> 39:51.535
One horizontal mattress should do it.

39:51.739 --> 39:55.140
- Two units are in.
- Hang another two. How's the heart?

39:56.077 --> 39:58.807
- Starting to fill.
- Get the paddles ready.

39:59.013 --> 40:02.813
Okay, cardiac injury is repaired.
Mark the time.

40:03.017 --> 40:06.111
- V-fib.
- Charging to 20 and clear.

40:08.589 --> 40:12.047
- Sinus rhythm.
- Cardiac activity restored, mark time.

40:12.259 --> 40:14.819
- I've got a pulse.
- Excellent job, Kerry.

40:29.610 --> 40:31.009
Dr. Greene.

40:31.312 --> 40:33.303
Dr. Lee. Finding your way around?

40:33.514 --> 40:36.278
Yes, thanks. I wanted to ask you.

40:36.484 --> 40:39.146
I didn't feel I connected with you
at my interview.

40:39.353 --> 40:41.548
- Is that a correct assessment?
- How do you mean?

40:42.556 --> 40:45.423
I'd look over and wonder,
"Am I making my best case?"

40:46.560 --> 40:47.618
It was a good interview...

40:47.828 --> 40:49.819
I like this department
and I want this job.

40:50.030 --> 40:52.760
I'm one of the baddest ER bitches
out there.

40:53.634 --> 40:57.468
If I didn't make my best case before,
I'd like to try again now.

40:57.671 --> 40:59.104
Can I grab a soda and sit with you?

41:00.441 --> 41:01.965
Yeah, sure.

41:02.343 --> 41:04.436
Call me when he's in Recovery.

41:08.716 --> 41:13.380
- Don, I have something to confess.
- Oh?

41:13.587 --> 41:17.148
For a while I felt resentment
when it became clear...

41:17.358 --> 41:21.158
...I wasn't your choice to run
the Emergency Department full-time.

41:21.362 --> 41:24.695
- It's not that you weren't qualified...
- Hold on.

41:24.899 --> 41:29.598
Now I am so grateful to be putting
all of myself into medicine.

41:29.803 --> 41:34.240
And I want you to know there are
no lingering hard feelings on my part.

41:34.441 --> 41:37.808
Well, I must say I could sense
the bad feelings.

41:38.145 --> 41:43.082
I did wish there was something I could
do because I value your friendship.

41:43.284 --> 41:45.149
Well, how's the job search going?

41:45.352 --> 41:48.788
We interviewed a wonderful woman.
Amanda Lee, out of Atlanta.

41:48.989 --> 41:51.184
- I don't know her.
- Join us for dinner?

41:51.392 --> 41:52.950
I'd love to hear what you think.

41:53.160 --> 41:56.596
Don, I'm trying.
But I'm not all the way there yet.

41:57.665 --> 41:58.825
Thanks.

42:01.101 --> 42:03.331
Isn't it weird living with your boss?

42:03.537 --> 42:05.971
No, we get along okay.
Plus, it's a bargain.

42:06.173 --> 42:09.301
All I have to do is some yard work,
clean the gutters.

42:09.510 --> 42:11.705
Do the stuff that she can't handle.

42:15.649 --> 42:18.311
Roxanne, if you make me forget
this day...

42:18.519 --> 42:21.977
...I will owe you the biggest favor.
- Lousy day, huh?

42:22.189 --> 42:26.626
- My med student is driving me crazy.
- Lucy.

42:27.761 --> 42:29.786
There's so much I want to teach her.

42:29.997 --> 42:31.555
And it's just not happening.

42:31.765 --> 42:33.289
I don't think I'm a bad teacher.

42:33.500 --> 42:35.058
I don't think she's a bad student.

42:36.136 --> 42:39.697
You know what?
I can say one good thing about Lucy.

42:39.907 --> 42:41.602
She's not here.

42:42.676 --> 42:44.735
Oh, you make a good point.

42:49.850 --> 42:54.116
- Didn't mean to put you to work.
- Don't be silly. It's gonna be nice.

43:09.503 --> 43:11.027
- Want some more?
- No, no.

43:11.238 --> 43:12.705
It was good, though.

43:12.906 --> 43:16.808
Hey, who's making all that noise?
What's up, man?

43:17.011 --> 43:19.275
Come on.
Let's get ready to go, huh?

43:19.480 --> 43:21.471
Come on, say goodbye to Aunt Jackie.

43:21.715 --> 43:23.876
Jackie, who gave him this phone?

43:24.084 --> 43:27.850
Oh, it's a toy, Peter.
It's a cute shape, and he likes it.

43:28.055 --> 43:30.114
He probably saw you on it all day.

43:30.324 --> 43:31.416
Hey, hey!

43:31.625 --> 43:35.527
I'm sorry. You know,
we went to a surgeon today.

43:36.163 --> 43:39.690
I'm trying to do what's best, and
I feel like I'm in a battlefield.

43:39.900 --> 43:42.460
The more information I get,
the less I know.

43:42.670 --> 43:44.467
I don't have anybody to talk with.

43:44.672 --> 43:46.139
What about Carla?

43:46.340 --> 43:50.333
Yeah, she's looking for me
to take the lead on this thing.

43:50.544 --> 43:53.012
I can't go back and forth
over it with her.

43:53.213 --> 43:54.441
Your girlfriend's a doctor.

43:54.648 --> 43:56.548
Why can't you talk with Elizabeth?

43:56.750 --> 44:00.345
- Hey, hey.
- Peter?

44:01.922 --> 44:03.890
- Hey, come on.
- Peter?

44:04.091 --> 44:06.821
Come on. Hey, man.
