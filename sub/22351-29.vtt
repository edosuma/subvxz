WEBVTT

00:01.990 --> 00:07.989
In moments, either John or
Steve will be evicted, but their
game may not be over.

00:07.990 --> 00:11.989
Tonight, the jurors battle to
re-enter the house for a second

00:11.990 --> 00:15.989
chance at the half million
dollar grand prize.

00:15.990 --> 00:18.990
Welcome to "Big Brother."

00:20.990 --> 00:28.539
Previously on "Big Brother":
With the house under the rule of

00:28.540 --> 00:30.289
Judas...
>> it could get ugly.

00:30.290 --> 00:33.989
Steve and John were sent to
the imagine narrium.

00:33.990 --> 00:39.119
Johnny Mac and Steve, you're
victims just like I am.

00:39.120 --> 00:42.989
But Austin secretly
considered targeting a bigger

00:42.990 --> 00:42.991
fish.

00:42.991 --> 00:46.989
I didn't put Vanessa up on
the block but she's still on my

00:46.990 --> 00:47.000
radar.

00:47.001 --> 00:51.989
If someone comes up with the
veto, she might be the one to

00:51.990 --> 00:51.991
come up.

00:51.991 --> 00:54.989
The poker player flushed any
chance at a backdoor.

00:54.990 --> 00:55.990
It's my birthday.

00:55.990 --> 00:56.990
It's my birthday.

00:56.990 --> 00:57.990
Oh, yeah.

00:57.991 --> 01:01.989
After extending an olive
branch...

01:01.990 --> 01:03.989
we want to work going
forward, I'm down.

01:03.990 --> 01:04.990
I do.

01:04.991 --> 01:06.949
I have no one.

01:06.950 --> 01:08.989
Vanessa considered using the
veto on John.

01:08.990 --> 01:11.989
I don't want you to go.

01:11.990 --> 01:14.989
I just gotta see where Austin's
head's at this morning.

01:14.990 --> 01:16.989
But when Austin shot her down...

01:16.990 --> 01:21.949
if you use the veto, I really
have to... I mean I'm ( Bleep ).

01:21.950 --> 01:24.830
She delivered the bad news.

01:24.990 --> 01:26.989
No.

01:26.990 --> 01:30.989
So Johnny Mac sold out Austin
and the twins.

01:30.990 --> 01:33.989
We had a five-person alliance
to get you out?

01:33.990 --> 01:34.990
Me.

01:34.991 --> 01:39.989
Johnny said there was last
week a five-person alliance to
get me out.

01:39.990 --> 01:40.990
That was true.

01:40.991 --> 01:44.990
The twin quickly threw Steve
under the bus.

01:45.120 --> 01:46.989
He wanted to bring Johnny Mac
into it.

01:46.990 --> 01:48.989
Sending Vanessa on the attack.

01:48.990 --> 01:49.990
Say good-bye.

01:49.991 --> 01:52.289
You anticipate got my vote.

01:52.290 --> 01:57.989
At the veto meeting, Vanessa
pulled no punches.

01:57.990 --> 02:01.989
Steve comes up to me, gives me a
big old hug and tells me just

02:01.990 --> 02:05.989
how happy he is that I got
picked to play in the veto

02:05.990 --> 02:05.991
competition.

02:05.991 --> 02:08.289
I bet you were even more happy
when I won it.

02:08.290 --> 02:09.989
Needless to say, I have decided
to not use the power of veto.

02:09.990 --> 02:12.989
Tonight, will the dentist be
extracted from the house or will

02:12.990 --> 02:15.989
the trombonist play his final
tune?

02:15.990 --> 02:20.949
Plus an epic battle will begin
to send one juror back into the
game.

02:20.950 --> 02:24.989
All this live on "Big Brother."

02:24.990 --> 02:27.989
You stink, and I am hooking
up with a guy that has a
girlfriend.

02:27.990 --> 02:29.990
Whatever.

02:33.990 --> 02:35.870
Captioning funded by CBS
( Cheers and applause )

03:07.990 --> 03:09.989
Julie: Good evening.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.989
I'm Julie chen.

03:11.990 --> 03:13.989
Welcome to "Big Brother."

03:13.990 --> 03:17.989
For a second week, Austin and
the twins were in control of the

03:17.990 --> 03:21.989
house but could not decide on a
target.

03:21.990 --> 03:25.989
Ultimately, they took the safe
route and decided to split up

03:25.990 --> 03:28.989
John and Steve, but their
decision could backfire on them

03:28.990 --> 03:32.989
because before the hour's up,
either John or Steve will get

03:32.990 --> 03:35.989
the chance to re-enter the game.

03:35.990 --> 03:39.989
To do that, they'll have to beat
out Shelli, Jackie, and Becky in

03:39.990 --> 03:41.949
an epic battle.

03:41.950 --> 03:45.289
So who will get a second shot to
play the "Big Brother" game?

03:45.290 --> 03:46.989
We'll find out soon enough.

03:46.990 --> 03:50.999
But first, for weeks, Vanessa
has been a target for the

03:51.000 --> 03:55.989
majority of the house, and not
only has she survived time and

03:55.990 --> 03:56.990
time again.

03:56.991 --> 04:04.991
She has controlled who has gone
home week after week.

04:11.990 --> 04:15.989
So the bad news is despite
the fact they told Vanessa, hey,

04:15.990 --> 04:18.989
there's a five-person alliance
that I was a part of working

04:18.990 --> 04:21.989
against you, she does not use
the veto on me.

04:21.990 --> 04:25.119
The good news is, it seems like
she's kind of mad at Steve,

04:25.120 --> 04:25.990
which is not me.

04:25.991 --> 04:30.989
I used to have, like, a 0%
chance of staying, and maybe I

04:30.990 --> 04:34.949
have, like, a 2% chance now.

04:34.950 --> 04:38.289
I'm feelinges tense right now
because Vanessa attacked me in

04:38.290 --> 04:39.989
front of the entire house.

04:39.990 --> 04:44.989
I think right now, I just need
to step away, get in in a

04:44.990 --> 04:45.990
rational state of mind.

04:45.991 --> 04:48.989
Which way do we go?

04:48.990 --> 04:50.989
Awkward.

04:50.990 --> 04:51.830
Really?

04:51.831 --> 04:52.989
I think both of them should go
home.

04:52.990 --> 04:55.989
I just care about that me &
Meg are safe.

04:55.990 --> 04:59.990
Dodged a bullet on that one.

05:02.990 --> 05:04.539
You okay?

05:04.540 --> 05:06.989
I want so badly not to cry
right now.

05:06.990 --> 05:10.989
After hearing all the things
that John had to say, I realized

05:10.990 --> 05:13.989
that maybe I'm lower on the
totem pole with Austin and the

05:13.990 --> 05:14.990
twins than I thought.

05:14.991 --> 05:18.989
I really want to make sure that
things are okay.

05:18.990 --> 05:21.989
Our actions should speech
louder than these words,

05:21.990 --> 05:21.991
Vanessa.

05:21.991 --> 05:23.989
I had all the power last week.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.989
I could have backdoored you
against everyone.

05:25.990 --> 05:26.990
I understand.

05:26.991 --> 05:30.989
Johnny Mac and Steve were the
ones going after you.

05:30.990 --> 05:32.989
I'm not mad at you guys.

05:32.990 --> 05:34.989
I'm mad at Steve.

05:34.990 --> 05:37.989
Huevery reason, you had every
reason, you, especially, had

05:37.990 --> 05:38.999
every reason because you didn't
know.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.289
We should have confronted you
sooner and we're really sorry.

05:43.290 --> 05:46.989
I'm trying to be as upfront with
Vanessa as possible because she

05:46.990 --> 05:49.989
very well could have been the
backdoor target this week.

05:49.990 --> 05:51.989
However, if it didn't happen,
it's irrevelant, right?

05:51.990 --> 05:54.989
Now we're just trying to smooth
things over with her and move

05:54.990 --> 05:54.991
forward.

05:54.991 --> 05:59.949
The point is him acting like
he's my ( Bleep ) Friend behind

05:59.950 --> 06:01.989
the scenes and that he totally
has my back.

06:01.990 --> 06:09.989
Let me tell you, the level of
loyalty to that...

06:09.990 --> 06:12.989
is there any way I can help
or should I leave you alone?

06:12.990 --> 06:15.989
I think this should be a time
to leave me alone.

06:15.990 --> 06:16.830
Leave you alone?

06:16.830 --> 06:17.290
Yes, please.

06:17.291 --> 06:21.699
Will do.

06:21.700 --> 06:24.989
I'm very upset with Steve for
orchestrating it and saying the

06:24.990 --> 06:26.989
things he was saying behind the
diseens me.

06:26.990 --> 06:27.700
Yeah.

06:27.701 --> 06:29.989
But even Johnny Mac was
coming up there and giving us

06:29.990 --> 06:31.989
things about you.

06:31.990 --> 06:34.989
If Johnny Mac thought by
telling Vanessa about this

06:34.990 --> 06:37.989
five-person deal it was going to
break up our relationship with

06:37.990 --> 06:38.990
her, think again, Johnny Mac.

06:38.991 --> 06:42.289
Sorry, man, but you did nothing
to help yourself.

06:42.290 --> 06:46.989
Honestly, like, I can't tell
you how much it's, like, I do

06:46.990 --> 06:54.990
not blame you.

06:58.990 --> 06:59.990
You're going to talk to him?

06:59.991 --> 07:03.989
I just want to ask him why he
did what he did.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.699
What is he thinking?

07:05.700 --> 07:06.989
He still has a chance to stay.

07:06.990 --> 07:07.990
I know.

07:07.990 --> 07:08.950
So dumb.

07:08.951 --> 07:11.989
Even though I am so heated
about this five-person deal that

07:11.990 --> 07:13.989
Johnny Mac tried to blow up in
my face... hey, can we talk?

07:13.990 --> 07:13.991
Sure.

07:13.991 --> 07:16.989
I have to think about the
long-term benefit.

07:16.990 --> 07:18.989
He's a jury vote, number one,
and two, if he stays in the

07:18.990 --> 07:21.989
house I don't want him going
after me.

07:21.990 --> 07:22.990
I have a quick question.

07:22.991 --> 07:26.989
Why would you tell Vanessa about
the five-person deal?

07:26.990 --> 07:29.409
Why would you threaten to piss
people off?

07:29.410 --> 07:30.989
I don't understand.

07:30.990 --> 07:31.990
You were after her, too.

07:31.991 --> 07:34.539
Yeah, I know, I was.

07:34.540 --> 07:37.989
But, so, then why would you
say it?

07:37.990 --> 07:38.290
Like.

07:38.291 --> 07:42.989
Because I thought you guys
kind of went back on it when you

07:42.990 --> 07:46.949
put Steve and me on the the
block.

07:46.950 --> 07:46.990
Okay.

07:46.991 --> 07:51.989
Well, I just think that it's
kind of weird of you to say that

07:51.990 --> 07:53.989
when you have a chance to stay.

07:53.990 --> 07:54.990
I don't think I do.

07:54.991 --> 07:56.989
You don't?

07:56.990 --> 07:57.000
Okay.

07:57.001 --> 08:00.289
You guys like Steve.

08:00.290 --> 08:03.829
Well, honestly, I like you,
Johnny Mac, but the fact that

08:03.830 --> 08:06.409
you had to do that just, like,
really, like, pissed me off,

08:06.410 --> 08:09.829
because it makes me feel like
when your back is against the

08:09.830 --> 08:11.409
wall, you're just going to blab
your mouth.

08:11.410 --> 08:11.990
Whoa!

08:11.990 --> 08:12.990
Hold the phone, Liz!

08:12.991 --> 08:15.409
It's not like someone else put
me on the block.

08:15.410 --> 08:21.989
You and Austin put me on the
block and that's not what a good

08:21.990 --> 08:22.999
alliance member does!

08:23.000 --> 08:26.989
So as far as I'm concerned, I
can say whatever the hell I

08:26.990 --> 08:26.991
want.

08:26.991 --> 08:30.989
If you put Steve and me up on
the block, like, it makes me

08:30.990 --> 08:34.409
feel like you have a deal with
James and Meg, you know.

08:34.410 --> 08:35.000
It's just how I feel.

08:35.000 --> 08:35.990
Yeah.

08:35.991 --> 08:39.289
And you guys didn't really go
out of your way to make me feel

08:39.290 --> 08:39.990
safe.

08:39.990 --> 08:39.991
Okay.

08:39.991 --> 08:43.989
So I just... I felt like... it
was a judgment call.

08:43.990 --> 08:44.999
It was what I had to do at the
time.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.989
Okay.

08:48.990 --> 08:49.990
Sorry.

08:49.990 --> 08:50.830
It's okay.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.989
Sucks to suck, Jack.

08:52.990 --> 08:53.700
You're still on the block.

08:53.701 --> 09:01.701
So I will forgive you and play
nice but I will not forget.

09:05.990 --> 09:07.119
Hey.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.409
I'm going to take a little nap
here.

09:09.410 --> 09:10.989
Did you work out already?

09:10.990 --> 09:12.989
I think I'll do it tonight.

09:12.990 --> 09:15.999
If I have any chance to stay in
this game, I need Vanessa on my

09:16.000 --> 09:18.989
side because it takes three
votes to stay this week.

09:18.990 --> 09:22.989
So I just need to get Vanessa to
trust me more, and I'm going to

09:22.990 --> 09:26.989
do this by being brutally honest
with her, and if she trusts me

09:26.990 --> 09:34.990
more than Steve, then I stay and
Steve goes.

09:37.990 --> 09:43.989
I can go up to Meg and James
and be like, "look, I'm mad at

09:43.990 --> 09:44.700
Vanessa.

09:44.701 --> 09:51.989
And I'm really mad at the other
threthree."

09:51.990 --> 09:54.989
"If I win this h.O.H., you know
who I'm coming after."

09:54.990 --> 09:56.989
I think that will get their
votes.

09:56.990 --> 10:00.989
John thinks one of the paths
toward staying is for me to vote

10:00.990 --> 10:01.990
with Meg and James.

10:01.991 --> 10:05.989
What he doesn't know is I'll
never go against the twins.

10:05.990 --> 10:09.989
For him to have a chance to
stay, it's for the twins to vote

10:09.990 --> 10:10.990
with me.

10:10.991 --> 10:14.989
The problem is the twins are
going to want me to vote with

10:14.990 --> 10:18.990
them.

10:23.990 --> 10:26.989
So do you want to talk or do
you want me to talk?

10:26.990 --> 10:29.989
I have nothing really else to
say.

10:29.990 --> 10:30.540
I said what I needed to say.

10:30.541 --> 10:32.989
Steve, like, you have done me so
dirty over the last week.

10:32.990 --> 10:34.989
You are approach my limit.

10:34.990 --> 10:37.989
If you lie to me in this
conversation, that's going to be
it.

10:37.990 --> 10:39.989
You never told me there was
anyone any alliance.

10:39.990 --> 10:43.989
You mean me, the twins,
Austin, Johnny Mac?

10:43.990 --> 10:46.989
Uh-huh.

10:46.990 --> 10:48.989
We talked this week about you.

10:48.990 --> 10:49.990
Last week.

10:49.991 --> 10:52.989
Nothing happened last week.

10:52.990 --> 10:54.989
What do you mean?

10:54.990 --> 10:55.990
The one whose whole purpose was
to get me out this week.

10:55.990 --> 10:56.990
That conversation happened
this week.

10:56.991 --> 10:58.989
This week?

10:58.990 --> 10:59.540
When Austin was h.O.H.

10:59.540 --> 10:59.990
Yes.

10:59.990 --> 11:00.990
What is this.

11:00.991 --> 11:03.949
Am I like in the ( Bleep )
Twilight zone?

11:03.950 --> 11:06.119
Do you not know why I'm mad?

11:06.120 --> 11:07.000
Do you know what I know?

11:07.001 --> 11:08.989
No, I missed that part.

11:08.990 --> 11:10.989
That's a pretty important part.

11:10.990 --> 11:12.989
An alliance with the five of
us...

11:12.990 --> 11:15.989
Steve, you're going to go
home unless...

11:15.990 --> 11:16.990
I know.

11:16.991 --> 11:18.989
Vanessa is in a very
intimidating person.

11:18.990 --> 11:20.409
She's in my face.

11:20.410 --> 11:22.989
I'm going home if I don't have
her vote.

11:22.990 --> 11:25.409
She put me on the to the spotand
my brain freezes.

11:25.410 --> 11:30.410
I can't remember what happened
five minutes ago right now let
alone what happened a week ago.

11:32.990 --> 11:33.990
Actually, I'm really glad
you're here.

11:33.991 --> 11:35.829
Oh.

11:35.830 --> 11:38.829
Do you remember when you guys
made that five-person group?

11:38.830 --> 11:39.989
It was last week.

11:39.990 --> 11:39.991
Yeah.

11:39.991 --> 11:41.409
During Liz's h.O.H.

11:41.410 --> 11:41.990
Yeah.

11:41.991 --> 11:43.989
That's what I thought.

11:43.990 --> 11:44.410
Like, dude.

11:44.410 --> 11:44.990
Okay.

11:44.991 --> 11:47.829
I don't understand how you
can possibly screw that up.

11:47.830 --> 11:48.989
Then I'm wrong.

11:48.990 --> 11:49.990
That simple.

11:49.991 --> 11:51.989
Then I am putting pieces
together wrong in my head.

11:51.990 --> 11:54.409
What do you mean?

11:54.410 --> 11:56.989
Honestly, you make yourself seem
even more shady.

11:56.990 --> 11:58.989
I'm going to brush my teeth.

11:58.990 --> 12:01.989
From what I can tell, Steve's
game is being ploan up by

12:01.990 --> 12:05.989
Vanessa right now, and I feel
great about that, because it's

12:05.990 --> 12:06.990
not me.

12:06.991 --> 12:08.949
So, Vanessa, go for it.

12:08.950 --> 12:11.539
Because I'm on board.

12:11.540 --> 12:14.949
What you're upset about is
the difference in timing

12:14.950 --> 12:17.949
between...
>> no what I'm mad about is the

12:17.950 --> 12:17.990
two-faced ( Bleep ).

12:17.991 --> 12:21.119
You had that planned this week
and you act excited when I get

12:21.120 --> 12:22.989
pulled... I don't know how much
that hurt my feelings.

12:22.990 --> 12:24.989
That is, like, so terrible.

12:24.990 --> 12:25.990
That's rotten.

12:25.991 --> 12:33.991
I'm so ( Bleep ) Hurt by you,
hurt.

12:40.990 --> 12:41.990
Hey, ladies.

12:41.990 --> 12:42.990
Hey!

12:42.990 --> 12:43.990
Hey!

12:43.991 --> 12:44.999
What's up?

12:45.000 --> 12:48.829
Most likely, us two are
voting with Vanessa, so, we want

12:48.830 --> 12:50.989
to know, like, where your head
is at.

12:50.990 --> 12:53.989
Vanessa, Julia, and I have
the power this week to send

12:53.990 --> 12:55.989
someone home and this is a huge
decision.

12:55.990 --> 12:58.409
This could make or break our
game.

12:58.410 --> 13:01.989
I just want to make sure that,
like you, you know, aren't

13:01.990 --> 13:04.989
coming after us because that
would suck.

13:04.990 --> 13:09.699
No, I win h.O.H., it's, like,
do you want to go after James

13:09.700 --> 13:11.989
and Meg, whoever comes back?

13:11.990 --> 13:12.990
Like, I need ton.

13:12.991 --> 13:15.989
What I think is reasonable is
to go after the person who

13:15.990 --> 13:16.950
returns from the jury.

13:16.950 --> 13:17.410
Okay.

13:17.411 --> 13:21.989
We'll take the juror out, and
you three don't want to be up as

13:21.990 --> 13:22.700
pawns.

13:22.700 --> 13:23.410
Is that pretty much the deal?

13:23.410 --> 13:23.990
Yeah.

13:23.990 --> 13:24.990
That's doable.

13:24.991 --> 13:26.989
The twins are saying all the
right things to me.

13:26.990 --> 13:30.989
I love what I'm hearing, and if
Vanessa's on my side, Steve can

13:30.990 --> 13:33.989
go this week and I might end up
staying.

13:33.990 --> 13:35.989
That's our wager.

13:35.990 --> 13:39.989
I know what Vanessa more or less
wants, but at the end of the

13:39.990 --> 13:43.949
day, I have to be able to trust
Johnny Mac.

13:43.950 --> 13:44.989
I don't know if I can trust him.

13:44.990 --> 13:49.990
That's pretty easy.

13:52.990 --> 13:57.409
Basically, like, I just want
to say...

13:57.410 --> 13:59.989
you're essentially the swing
vote.

13:59.990 --> 14:01.989
I'm voting with you guys.

14:01.990 --> 14:02.990
So I'm not swinging anything.

14:02.991 --> 14:05.989
Johnny Mac may think we have
a deal, but all bets are off

14:05.990 --> 14:09.119
until we sit down with Vanessa
and decide what we really want

14:09.120 --> 14:09.990
to do.

14:09.991 --> 14:12.989
He hasn't done ( Bleep ) In
the the game.

14:12.990 --> 14:15.989
He's is like a Meg.

14:15.990 --> 14:16.999
He doesn't win anything.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.119
He's a floater.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.409
He's so bad of a player.

14:19.410 --> 14:21.989
I know.

14:21.990 --> 14:24.989
Are we stupid not to consider
that?

14:24.990 --> 14:32.989
My gut literally tells me to
get out Johnny Mac.

14:32.990 --> 14:35.989
Number two, he never, like,
outright was going after you

14:35.990 --> 14:39.829
until he heard all this stuff
about you.

14:39.830 --> 14:42.989
Johnny Mac, however, was.

14:42.990 --> 14:43.990
That's what I'm scared of.

14:43.991 --> 14:48.409
But, also, like, if we keep
Steve, if Jackie comes back,

14:48.410 --> 14:50.989
that's your number one target is
Steve.

14:50.990 --> 14:54.699
If you get in the finals with
Steve, everyone's going to vote

14:54.700 --> 14:55.989
for Steve.

14:55.990 --> 14:57.829
They're always going to feel bad
for him.

14:57.830 --> 15:00.989
They'll be like he's been a fan
of the game forever.

15:00.990 --> 15:02.989
The worst part about this all...

15:02.990 --> 15:08.989
my gut is very confused.

15:08.990 --> 15:13.699
Julie: Coming up, James'
friends reveal what this

15:13.700 --> 15:16.989
fun-loving prankster is really
like back home.

15:16.990 --> 15:20.989
Then, either John or Steve will
be evicted, but their game is

15:20.990 --> 15:22.989
still very much alive.

15:22.990 --> 15:25.989
The jurors' battle to get back
in the house is just around the

15:25.990 --> 15:26.990
corner.

15:26.991 --> 15:31.989
And remember, the zingbot
Twitter account is now

15:31.990 --> 15:32.700
officially open.

15:32.701 --> 15:37.699
And in less than a week, he has
almost 100,000 followers.

15:37.700 --> 15:39.989
Not bad for a robot.

15:39.990 --> 15:41.990
Stay with us.

16:12.990 --> 16:14.989
Welcome back to "Big Brother."

16:14.990 --> 16:18.289
James has pranked just about
everyone in the house, but his

16:18.290 --> 16:21.989
bar buddies back home think his
biggest prank may be walking

16:21.990 --> 16:27.989
away with the half million
dollar grand prize.

16:27.990 --> 16:29.989
I saw and you your friend
when you all came in.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.989
I was like, you're super cute.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.829
Are you guys playing like
you're at a bar.

16:33.830 --> 16:33.990
Yeah.

16:33.991 --> 16:35.989
This is my buddy Austin, by the
way.

16:35.990 --> 16:36.990
Hey, Austin.

16:36.990 --> 16:37.990
This is Meg.

16:37.991 --> 16:39.699
I just met her.

16:39.700 --> 16:42.989
James, that is the worst!

16:42.990 --> 16:44.989
I bet you have a great shower
voice.

16:44.990 --> 16:47.699
A great shower voice?

16:47.700 --> 16:49.989
I've been drinking too many
beers.

16:49.990 --> 16:53.990
At this point, all conversation
is accepted.

16:55.540 --> 16:57.699
I'm Whitney.

16:57.700 --> 16:58.989
I'm friends with James.

16:58.990 --> 17:04.989
Wichita falls, there's not too
much to do so we go to the bar a
lot and hang out.

17:04.990 --> 17:07.989
James likes to go hunting and
fishing.

17:07.990 --> 17:11.989
So he goes by "the hillbilly
Asian."

17:11.990 --> 17:12.540
That's his nickname.

17:12.541 --> 17:13.989
Oh, my God, James!

17:13.990 --> 17:17.989
People expect him to be this
quiet, reserved guy, when in

17:17.990 --> 17:23.989
fact he's not.

17:23.990 --> 17:24.990
Well done.

17:24.991 --> 17:28.949
Can't fall asleep around
James or else you're going to

17:28.950 --> 17:28.990
become a victim.

17:28.991 --> 17:30.539
What are you doing, Steve.

17:30.540 --> 17:32.409
Has that happened to you, Jason?

17:32.410 --> 17:34.699
I don't miss that at all.

17:34.700 --> 17:38.989
I will scare her so good, Liz
is going to feel it.

17:38.990 --> 17:46.989
Arrghh!

17:46.990 --> 17:49.989
He definitely keeps the house
alive.

17:49.990 --> 17:53.289
I generally assume you're up
to no good when you're wearing

17:53.290 --> 17:53.990
the cat hat.

17:53.991 --> 17:56.989
I don't think Liz is getting
that kitty hat back.

17:56.990 --> 17:57.990
No!

17:57.991 --> 17:59.829
I'm going to have to wear it.

17:59.830 --> 18:02.989
I bet James really misses gizmo.

18:02.990 --> 18:04.989
Gizmo is James' child.

18:04.990 --> 18:08.989
He loves that cat so much, and
that cat goes fishing with us

18:08.990 --> 18:08.991
all the time.

18:08.991 --> 18:13.119
When I pull my boat up, like,
he's on the bow all times and

18:13.120 --> 18:17.699
people on the bank say is that a
dog?

18:17.700 --> 18:19.989
No it's a cat.

18:19.990 --> 18:21.829
He is a really good swimmer.

18:21.830 --> 18:24.539
How do you teach a cat to swim?

18:24.540 --> 18:28.999
Throw his ass in the water,
right.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.999
Whenever I'm in the mood to
watch chick flicks, I know I can

18:33.000 --> 18:34.989
always count on him to watch it
with me.

18:34.990 --> 18:36.989
James is just one of the girls.

18:36.990 --> 18:39.989
You need to fix that corner.

18:39.990 --> 18:41.989
James is a stand-up guy.

18:41.990 --> 18:44.119
He's big-hearted.

18:44.120 --> 18:45.989
You need some more of this.

18:45.990 --> 18:46.990
Oh, yes I do.

18:46.991 --> 18:49.949
He's a great guy to hang around.

18:49.950 --> 18:49.990
Perfect.

18:49.991 --> 18:52.989
I think James has a huge
crush on Meg because she's

18:52.990 --> 18:55.989
really sweet and she's really
pretty.

18:55.990 --> 18:59.989
( Cheers and applause )
And he's really into blond girls

18:59.990 --> 19:01.989
that are taller than him.

19:01.990 --> 19:03.829
Yeah!

19:03.830 --> 19:05.989
Do you think she likes him at
all?

19:05.990 --> 19:07.989
Nothing's going to come out
of it.

19:07.990 --> 19:13.289
He should inform her that he
has a taller, better-look

19:13.290 --> 19:13.990
roommate.

19:13.990 --> 19:14.990
Good night, sweetheart.

19:14.991 --> 19:16.989
Good night, Mr. James.

19:16.990 --> 19:17.990
Shut up, Steve.

19:17.991 --> 19:21.989
But I'm glad he has her in
the house.

19:21.990 --> 19:25.989
A social game, his is the
best one in the house.

19:25.990 --> 19:28.989
Even if you're not in his
alliance, he's still going to be

19:28.990 --> 19:29.990
nice to you.

19:29.991 --> 19:34.989
To win "Big Brother," James has
to play a smart game and

19:34.990 --> 19:37.989
probably align with somebody
stronger than Meg.

19:37.990 --> 19:40.289
Meg, I think I saw a turtle
pass you.

19:40.290 --> 19:41.989
Shut up, James.

19:41.990 --> 19:47.989
James owes me 20 bucks, so I
really need him to win "big
brother."

19:47.990 --> 19:49.989
Julie: In the moments
leading up to the show tonight,

19:49.990 --> 19:55.989
the houseguests were still
undecided as to who they will be
evicting.

19:55.990 --> 19:59.829
Let's head to the living room
and find out what will happen.

19:59.830 --> 19:59.990
Houseguests.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.989
Hey, Julie!

20:01.990 --> 20:04.989
Julie: It is time for the
live vote, everyone.

20:04.990 --> 20:08.989
John, Steve, in just moments,
your housemates will cast their

20:08.990 --> 20:12.989
votes to evict live, but before
they do, you each have a final

20:12.990 --> 20:16.989
chance to sway their vote with
one brief statement.

20:16.990 --> 20:18.699
John, you're first.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.949
All right.

20:20.950 --> 20:26.409
Steve, you and I are probably
e biggest do, dorks in here, but

20:26.410 --> 20:29.699
in my mind, we'll always be rock
star status.

20:29.700 --> 20:34.989
When you're voting tonight,
Steve knows a lot about "big

20:34.990 --> 20:39.989
brother" things, and I don't,
but I am really good at picking

20:39.990 --> 20:43.119
up my own dishes and gas
management.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.989
So please vote for me to stay.

20:45.990 --> 20:47.989
I'd appreciate your vote.

20:47.990 --> 20:50.989
Julie: Was that a knock on
Steve's gas management?

20:50.990 --> 20:51.990
No!

20:51.990 --> 20:52.990
Julie: Okay.

20:52.990 --> 20:53.830
Just checking.

20:53.831 --> 20:56.409
Thank you, John.

20:56.410 --> 20:57.989
Steve, you have the floor.

20:57.990 --> 20:58.950
Thank you.

20:58.951 --> 21:00.989
First, a huge thank you to my
family and friend at home and

21:00.990 --> 21:05.409
anyone who helped me get to this
point because your support means

21:05.410 --> 21:06.989
absolutely everything to me.

21:06.990 --> 21:09.989
Houseguests, when I walked in
here 71 days ago, as zingbot

21:09.990 --> 21:13.989
pointed out, I was a nerdy and
socially awkward trombonist who

21:13.990 --> 21:17.409
loves my mom and since then I've
had a lot of really cool

21:17.410 --> 21:17.990
experiences.

21:17.991 --> 21:21.989
I got to play my first game of
truth or dare, my first game of

21:21.990 --> 21:25.949
spin the bottle and gave Meg the
most awkward kiss she will ever

21:25.950 --> 21:26.989
have in her life.

21:26.990 --> 21:30.989
I want to thank you for making
me feel for socially confident

21:30.990 --> 21:34.829
as a person than I ever have
before.

21:34.830 --> 21:36.989
For your vote tonight, I would
obviously appreciate your votes

21:36.990 --> 21:39.989
but I understand you have to do
what's best for your game.

21:39.990 --> 21:40.990
If I do walk out that door,
despite everything that happens,

21:40.991 --> 21:46.989
I will walk out a nerdy
trombonist, a 5:00 shadow, a new

21:46.990 --> 21:53.989
haircut, and an experience I'll
never forget.

21:53.990 --> 21:54.540
Julie: Well done.

21:54.541 --> 21:55.989
Thank you, both.

21:55.990 --> 21:59.989
All right, everyone, it is time
for the live vote to begin.

21:59.990 --> 22:02.989
Austin, as head of household are
you not allowed to vote.

22:02.990 --> 22:04.949
Neither are the two nominees.

22:04.950 --> 22:08.989
One at a time the rest of you
will enter the the diary room

22:08.990 --> 22:09.999
and cast your vote to evict.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.989
Meg, you're up first tonight.

22:11.990 --> 22:15.989
Please go to the diary room.

22:15.990 --> 22:19.989
At one point, Meg and Johnny Mac
were allies.

22:19.990 --> 22:23.989
So where do they stand now?

22:23.990 --> 22:24.290
Hi, Meg.

22:24.291 --> 22:26.999
Hey, Julie.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.829
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

22:28.830 --> 22:31.989
I vote to evict Johnny Mac.

22:31.990 --> 22:31.991
Julie: Thank you.

22:31.991 --> 22:34.989
Thank you.

22:34.990 --> 22:38.989
Julie: James' social game
kept him off the block this
week.

22:38.990 --> 22:43.989
So who will be best for his game
moving forward?

22:43.990 --> 22:44.120
Hi, James.

22:44.121 --> 22:45.989
Hey, Julie.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.539
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.989
I vote to evict John.

22:49.990 --> 22:50.990
Julie: Thank you.

22:50.991 --> 22:52.989
Thank you, Julie.

22:52.990 --> 22:58.989
Julie: Vanessa has been
going back and forth on whom to

22:58.990 --> 23:03.989
evict tonight, so who will she
be gambling on with her vote?

23:03.990 --> 23:04.990
Hi, Vanessa.

23:04.991 --> 23:06.989
Hey, Julie! Please cast
your vote to evict.

23:06.990 --> 23:10.989
I vote to evict Johnny Mac.

23:10.990 --> 23:12.989
Julie: Thank you.

23:12.990 --> 23:15.989
It's official, with three votes
to evict John, John will leave

23:15.990 --> 23:16.990
the house tonight.

23:16.991 --> 23:21.989
But let's see how the other
votes fall.

23:21.990 --> 23:21.991
Hi, Julia.

23:21.991 --> 23:23.989
Hey, Julie.

23:23.990 --> 23:25.989
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

23:25.990 --> 23:28.989
I vote to evict John.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.989
Julie: Thank you.

23:30.990 --> 23:34.989
Liz sees the advantage of Steve
as an Ally and has been very

23:34.990 --> 23:40.989
vocal about keeping him in the
house.

23:40.990 --> 23:40.991
Hi, Liz.

23:40.991 --> 23:42.989
Hi, Julie.

23:42.990 --> 23:43.990
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

23:43.991 --> 23:46.989
I vote to evict Johnny Mac.

23:46.990 --> 23:47.990
Julie: Thank you.

23:47.991 --> 23:53.990
Thank you.

23:58.990 --> 24:01.989
Julie: All of the votes
are in, and with five votes to

24:01.990 --> 24:04.989
evict John, John will leave the
house tonight.

24:04.990 --> 24:08.999
When we return, we'll give the
news to the houseguests.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.999
Then it's two battles in one as
jurors Shelli, Jackie, Becky,

24:14.000 --> 24:17.989
and John compete to get back
into the game, and everyone

24:17.990 --> 24:19.989
fight it out for head of
household.

24:19.990 --> 24:21.990
Stay with us.

24:40.990 --> 24:41.990
Julie: Welcome back to

24:41.990 --> 24:42.700
"Big Brother."

24:42.701 --> 24:45.989
By a vote of 5-0, the
houseguests have just voted to

24:45.990 --> 24:46.990
evict John.

24:46.991 --> 24:50.989
But before the hour is up, he
and the other jurors will have

24:50.990 --> 24:53.989
their shot at getting back in
the game.

24:53.990 --> 24:57.989
Let's return to the living room
and reveal the results of the

24:57.990 --> 24:58.990
vote.

24:58.991 --> 25:00.989
Houseguests, the votes are in.

25:00.990 --> 25:04.289
When I reveal the vote, the
evicted houseguest will have

25:04.290 --> 25:07.989
just a few moments to say
good-bye, gather his belongings,

25:07.990 --> 25:09.989
and walk out the front door.

25:09.990 --> 25:16.989
By a vote of 5-0, John, you are
evicted from the "Big Brother"

25:16.990 --> 25:24.990
house.

25:33.990 --> 25:39.989
By, Mac.

25:39.990 --> 25:41.989
Whack street boy for life.

25:41.990 --> 25:44.289
Good luck, guys.

25:44.290 --> 25:48.989
Go get 'em, go get 'em.

25:48.990 --> 25:56.990
( Cheers and applause )
>> Had to do it, man.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.409
Good work.

26:09.410 --> 26:10.699
Thank you.

26:10.700 --> 26:11.989
Oh!

26:11.990 --> 26:14.989
Oh, man, whoa!

26:14.990 --> 26:16.989
My heart is, like, literally
dying.

26:16.990 --> 26:19.989
I know.

26:19.990 --> 26:21.989
Get ready for this now.

26:21.990 --> 26:25.989
You guys, they went insane
for him.

26:25.990 --> 26:29.119
Yeah, Johnny Mac is...
>> he's a rock star, man.

26:29.120 --> 26:29.990
Loveable.

26:29.990 --> 26:30.990
Lovable.

26:30.991 --> 26:32.289
And a dentist.

26:32.290 --> 26:32.990
And a dentist.

26:32.991 --> 26:36.989
And a dentist.

26:36.990 --> 26:37.990
Julie: How you feeling?

26:37.991 --> 26:41.989
Yeah, I knew it was coming,
Julie.

26:41.990 --> 26:42.990
I can't lie.

26:42.991 --> 26:44.409
Julie: Let's talk about
the details.

26:44.410 --> 26:44.990
Okay.

26:44.991 --> 26:48.989
Julie: When Austin won
h.O.H., you thought you were

26:48.990 --> 26:49.990
sitting pretty.

26:49.991 --> 26:51.989
You thought you were aligned
with him and the twins.

26:51.990 --> 26:52.990
I thought so.

26:52.991 --> 26:54.989
Julie: So what do you
think happened?

26:54.990 --> 26:56.539
They're good.

26:56.540 --> 26:58.999
And they're aligned with
everyone, and then they just

26:59.000 --> 27:01.989
break it to the person that's
going out the door.

27:01.990 --> 27:03.989
That's pretty good.

27:03.990 --> 27:07.989
Julie: When you say
"they're good," you're talking

27:07.990 --> 27:09.989
about they're good, they
meaning...

27:09.990 --> 27:13.119
Austin and the twins, yeah.

27:13.120 --> 27:13.990
Julie: You like them?

27:13.991 --> 27:15.989
What they did was amazing.

27:15.990 --> 27:17.949
I'm mad that it happened to me.

27:17.950 --> 27:23.989
But, yeah, I mean I'm over it.

27:23.990 --> 27:24.120
( Laughter ).

27:24.121 --> 27:25.989
Julie: In the beginning of
the game.

27:25.990 --> 27:26.700
Right.

27:26.701 --> 27:29.989
Julie: It kind of seemed
like you were a loner.

27:29.990 --> 27:30.990
Yeah.

27:30.991 --> 27:32.989
Julie: In the beginning of
the week we saw you basically

27:32.990 --> 27:35.989
building alliances with a lot of
people in the house, but none of

27:35.990 --> 27:38.989
them... none of those alliances
seemed to stick.

27:38.990 --> 27:42.989
Why do you think the others in
the game didn't quite take those

27:42.990 --> 27:44.829
alliances or you seriously?

27:44.830 --> 27:44.990
I don't know.

27:44.991 --> 27:49.409
A lot of people don't take me
seriously, Julie.

27:49.410 --> 27:54.989
But I think the biggest problem
was I couldn't win anything.

27:54.990 --> 27:58.989
I got labeled as someone who
could win comps and I couldn't

27:58.990 --> 28:03.989
back it up, and I couldn't make
any, like, strong, like, deals.

28:03.990 --> 28:04.990
And yeah.

28:04.991 --> 28:06.539
I think that's all it was.

28:06.540 --> 28:07.989
I just couldn't back it up.

28:07.990 --> 28:09.989
Julie: You knew how to
throw a comp.

28:09.990 --> 28:11.989
I knew how to throw a comp.

28:11.990 --> 28:14.699
Yeah, I could do that.

28:14.700 --> 28:16.989
Julie: I will say that.

28:16.990 --> 28:19.119
You made no secret that you were
gunning for Vanessa.

28:19.120 --> 28:19.990
Yeah.

28:19.991 --> 28:21.989
Julie: And, obviously, you
couldn't get her out, you

28:21.990 --> 28:22.990
couldn't get her.

28:22.990 --> 28:23.990
No.

28:23.991 --> 28:26.539
Julie: Do you think being
so vocal about wanting to get

28:26.540 --> 28:29.989
her out is why you're sitting
here with me now?

28:29.990 --> 28:30.990
I don't think so.

28:30.991 --> 28:34.989
I think when you're playing this
game you have to have people

28:34.990 --> 28:36.989
you're closed to, people you're
kind of close to, and then you

28:36.990 --> 28:37.990
have to have enemies.

28:37.991 --> 28:41.989
If you have deals with everyone,
people central artery to find

28:41.990 --> 28:43.989
out out like they were starting
to do with Vanessa.

28:43.990 --> 28:47.989
I think that actually worked in
my favor last week, being so

28:47.990 --> 28:50.949
vocal about trying to get her
out.

28:50.950 --> 28:54.989
But yeah, it's good to have one
of me in the game, I feel.

28:54.990 --> 28:56.989
Julie: In your campaign
and trying to stay, we saw you

28:56.990 --> 28:59.989
in the last few days bond
suddenly with Vanessa.

28:59.990 --> 29:02.989
Had you stayed in the game,
would you truly have tried to

29:02.990 --> 29:03.990
work with her.

29:03.990 --> 29:04.990
Yeah.

29:04.991 --> 29:07.409
I would have tried to work with
her because just the way the

29:07.410 --> 29:09.989
house is, you have Austin and
the twins.

29:09.990 --> 29:11.989
They are not going to turn on
each other.

29:11.990 --> 29:13.989
And then you have James and Meg.

29:13.990 --> 29:15.989
They're not going to turn on
each other.

29:15.990 --> 29:18.989
If Steve was out here and it was
me and Vanessa still left in

29:18.990 --> 29:21.989
there, we would have pretty much
had to work together.

29:21.990 --> 29:24.989
Julie: In the event you
were the one evicted tonight

29:24.990 --> 29:26.989
your housemates taped some
good-bye messaged.

29:26.990 --> 29:27.290
All right.

29:27.291 --> 29:28.539
Julie: Look over here.

29:28.540 --> 29:28.990
Watch and listen.

29:28.990 --> 29:29.990
All right.

29:29.991 --> 29:32.989
Johnny Mac, I wanted to align
with you since the beginning of

29:32.990 --> 29:36.699
this game, but we never talked
game until last week.

29:36.700 --> 29:37.989
Please don't take it
permanently.

29:37.990 --> 29:39.989
I wish we could have worked
together.

29:39.990 --> 29:41.989
Rock on, man.

29:41.990 --> 29:44.989
Johnny Mac, we were pitted
against eaching for quite a

29:44.990 --> 29:46.989
while in this game but this week
we started from scratch.

29:46.990 --> 29:50.989
I genuinely believed we could
work together moving forward

29:50.990 --> 29:53.989
which is why I fought to have
you stay.

29:53.990 --> 29:54.990
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

29:54.991 --> 29:57.989
Hey, Johnny Mac, I know it's
been a really rough week going

29:57.990 --> 29:58.990
up against Steve.

29:58.991 --> 30:01.989
However, I really wish we could
have worked together sooner.

30:01.990 --> 30:04.999
You are the coolest rock star
dentist I ever met and maybe you

30:05.000 --> 30:07.989
can do some work on these teeth
one day.

30:07.990 --> 30:11.999
Hey, Johnny Mac, thank you so
much for geeking out with me

30:12.000 --> 30:12.990
this summer.

30:12.991 --> 30:17.409
I always knew I could Ally on
you and trust you and I'm really

30:17.410 --> 30:21.989
sorry we were together on the
block and hope to see you soon.

30:21.990 --> 30:22.990
Good luck, Johnny.

30:22.991 --> 30:24.989
Julie: Final thought?

30:24.990 --> 30:25.990
Steve is so adorable!

30:25.991 --> 30:27.989
Julie: One last question.

30:27.990 --> 30:33.989
If you get to go back in the
house, who are you going after?

30:33.990 --> 30:34.999
That... that's a tough
question.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.989
You think I'd go after Austin
and the twins?

30:37.990 --> 30:39.989
But it would probably be Meg.

30:39.990 --> 30:41.989
Julie: Meg?

30:41.990 --> 30:41.991
Meg.

30:41.991 --> 30:42.990
Julie: Why Meg?

30:42.991 --> 30:46.289
Because until James and Meg
are brocken up, I think people

30:46.290 --> 30:49.989
are going to keep falling back
on those two to, line with, so.

30:49.990 --> 30:50.990
Julie: Well.

30:50.991 --> 30:54.989
It's a weird one, but, yeah,
that's who I would go after.

30:54.990 --> 30:58.119
Julie: Tonight, you and
the other members of the jury

30:58.120 --> 31:00.989
will compete to get back in the
house.

31:00.990 --> 31:02.989
Maybe you can get back in there
and go after Meg.

31:02.990 --> 31:03.990
All right.

31:03.990 --> 31:04.990
Julie: Are you ready for
it?

31:04.991 --> 31:06.989
I'll give it a shot.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.989
I don't know how I'll do but
let's do it.

31:08.990 --> 31:10.999
Julie: Stay right it
there, sit tonight.

31:11.000 --> 31:11.990
We're moments away from that.

31:11.991 --> 31:18.989
Shelli, Jackie, Becky, and John
go head to head for a second
chance of winning it all.

31:18.990 --> 31:26.990
For this week's bbsoundoff, we
want to see you lip sync some of
the best lines of the season.

31:28.990 --> 31:36.989
Go to CBS.Com/bbsoundoff and
start sharing on Twitter and
instagram.

31:36.990 --> 31:38.990
Stay with us.

31:42.410 --> 31:48.990
Brocode # 5: If bro sees another
bro that's equally as gorgeous
other bro is not intimidated by
bro.

32:14.990 --> 32:15.990
Julie: Welcome back to
"Big Brother."

32:15.991 --> 32:21.989
John has just been evicted and
is eagerly awaiting his chance
to get back in the game.

32:21.990 --> 32:27.989
It's an opportunity that has
weighed heavily on the mind of
all the jurors.

32:27.990 --> 32:29.699
Oh, my God!

32:29.700 --> 32:32.409
You always get them!

32:32.410 --> 32:32.990
Cheater.

32:32.991 --> 32:35.989
I guess it's been nice just
having the two of us.

32:35.990 --> 32:36.540
I know.

32:36.541 --> 32:40.989
The vibe in the jury house is so
low key so relaxing.

32:40.990 --> 32:42.989
It's nothing like the "big
brother" house.

32:42.990 --> 32:46.989
We haven't spent any time alone
because we just want to hang
out.

32:46.990 --> 32:49.699
I need to hear what's happening
in our house.

32:49.700 --> 32:49.990
I know.

32:49.991 --> 32:52.989
We'll see who comes in.

32:52.990 --> 32:55.989
I'm definitely anxious to see
who will be coming in the house

32:55.989 --> 32:57.989
That will say a lot about the
how the tone of the house has

32:57.990 --> 33:00.989
been lately without me being
there.

33:00.990 --> 33:03.989
Who do you think it's going
to be?

33:03.990 --> 33:04.410
Maybe Becky.

33:04.411 --> 33:06.289
I really hope not, though.

33:06.290 --> 33:10.989
I would totally hate to see any
one of my alliance members,

33:10.990 --> 33:11.990
Becky, James, or Meg.

33:11.991 --> 33:14.989
Even though I would love to hang
out with them, I hope they're

33:14.990 --> 33:16.289
still in the "Big Brother" house
killing it.

33:16.290 --> 33:17.829
No!

33:17.830 --> 33:17.990
Becky!

33:17.991 --> 33:19.119
Becky!

33:19.120 --> 33:23.989
Coming out of "Big Brother"
house, it's a horrible feeling,

33:23.990 --> 33:27.699
and I made some bad game moves
and it's cost me this.

33:27.700 --> 33:28.989
Liz came after me.

33:28.990 --> 33:31.989
Becky, what happened to your
toe!

33:31.990 --> 33:35.289
I got an infection underneath
my toenail.

33:35.290 --> 33:36.290
That's a bad week.

33:36.291 --> 33:37.989
It's a bad week.

33:37.990 --> 33:39.699
All right, get ready.

33:39.700 --> 33:45.699
Let's take a look at the
final question.

33:45.700 --> 33:47.829
Oh, geez.

33:47.830 --> 33:48.000
Four times.

33:48.001 --> 33:49.409
Was it five?

33:49.410 --> 33:54.829
Congratulations, Liz, you are
the new head of household.

33:54.830 --> 33:56.989
I knew I was in trouble.

33:56.990 --> 34:01.289
I have nominated you, Becky,
and you, Johnny Mac.

34:01.290 --> 34:01.990
Wow.

34:01.991 --> 34:04.989
I'm really upset about Becky.

34:04.990 --> 34:08.989
I know she was fearing Vanessa
would come after her, as well as

34:08.990 --> 34:10.829
Austin and the twins, and sure
enough they did.

34:10.830 --> 34:11.989
Hello, "Big Brother"!

34:11.990 --> 34:14.289
Otev.

34:14.290 --> 34:18.989
Gosh, we missed everything,
Jack.

34:18.990 --> 34:19.120
Oh!

34:19.121 --> 34:20.989
She's just fine.

34:20.990 --> 34:26.989
Liz, you have won the power
of veto.

34:26.990 --> 34:30.119
She told you she wasn't going
to use it.

34:30.120 --> 34:32.989
She wanted to keep the noms
the same.

34:32.990 --> 34:35.989
Julie: By a vote of 6-0,
Becky, you are evicted from the

34:35.990 --> 34:38.989
"Big Brother" house.

34:38.990 --> 34:39.990
Oh!

34:39.991 --> 34:42.999
And then there I went.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.829
Well, one of us will be going
back.

34:46.830 --> 34:46.990
Yeah.

34:46.991 --> 34:49.989
I know that people will be
worried if I come back in those

34:49.990 --> 34:50.990
doors.

34:50.991 --> 34:52.989
Vanessa's actually someone I've
wanted to take out, but I have

34:52.990 --> 34:57.989
to also think of, okay, maybe
you send Liz because she has a

34:57.990 --> 34:58.990
showmance and a twin in the
house.

34:58.991 --> 35:01.119
Fiwere to go back in the
house, I would definitely want

35:01.120 --> 35:02.989
to stick with James and Meg.

35:02.990 --> 35:05.989
That's a great teem teamand
hopefully I can win h.O.H. As

35:05.990 --> 35:06.990
soon as I get back.

35:06.990 --> 35:07.990
Oh, my gosh.

35:07.991 --> 35:10.989
I want to be the first jury
member to make my way back into

35:10.990 --> 35:16.409
the "Big Brother" house, fight
my way to the end and win this
thing.

35:16.410 --> 35:20.539
Julie: Please welcome
Shelli, Jackie, Becky, and

35:20.540 --> 35:22.989
recent evictee, Johnny Mac.

35:22.990 --> 35:29.989
( Cheers and applause )
Welcome, jurors, welcome.

35:29.990 --> 35:36.989
All right, jurors, listen up
because shortly the four of you

35:36.990 --> 35:38.699
will compete head to head in a
live competition.

35:38.700 --> 35:42.989
The winner will be back in the
game which means one of you

35:42.990 --> 35:44.989
could go home with a half
million dollars.

35:44.990 --> 35:45.990
Are you guys ready?

35:45.990 --> 35:46.990
Yes.

35:46.990 --> 35:47.540
Yes.

35:47.541 --> 35:48.989
Julie: You're pumped?

35:48.990 --> 35:50.989
Yes!

35:50.990 --> 35:53.999
Julie: All right, well,
why don't I send you back in

35:54.000 --> 35:56.989
there because I know they are
expecting to see these four

35:56.990 --> 35:57.000
faces.

35:57.001 --> 35:59.989
Go on in, Johnny Mac, you lead
the way.

35:59.990 --> 36:01.989
Whooo!

36:01.990 --> 36:09.990
( Cheers and applause )
>> Oh, my God!

36:21.990 --> 36:24.989
Julie: Houseguests, hello,
houseguests.

36:24.990 --> 36:25.990
Hi, Julie!

36:25.991 --> 36:29.119
All right, I see you guys are
really pumped up.

36:29.120 --> 36:33.989
That is because as you are all
very well aware, four people

36:33.990 --> 36:36.949
have been sent to the jury
house, but tonight they are all

36:36.950 --> 36:36.990
back.

36:36.991 --> 36:40.989
And one of them will soon be
back in the game.

36:40.990 --> 36:44.989
Say hello to your former
housemates.

36:44.990 --> 36:49.830
( Doorbell )
>> Julie: All right,

37:33.990 --> 37:35.829
houseguests, listen up,
everyone.

37:35.830 --> 37:40.989
I need every single one of you
to head to the backyard right
away.

37:40.990 --> 37:46.989
It is time to battle it out.

37:46.990 --> 37:51.989
Up next, it's two epic
competitions in one.

37:51.990 --> 37:55.949
Four jurors battling to get back
in the game, and everyone the

37:55.950 --> 37:58.989
fighting to be the new head of
household.

37:58.990 --> 37:59.990
Stay with us.

38:17.990 --> 38:19.989
Julie: Welcome back to
"Big Brother."

38:19.990 --> 38:22.989
It's now time to find out which
juror will return to the game

38:22.990 --> 38:25.119
and who will become the new head
of household.

38:25.120 --> 38:31.409
Let's head to the backyard and
get things started.

38:31.410 --> 38:35.989
Houseguests, the power is back
up for grabs, and even more is

38:35.990 --> 38:38.989
at stake for Shelli, Jackie,
Becky, and John.

38:38.990 --> 38:43.989
One of them is about to win a
second shot at the half million

38:43.990 --> 38:44.990
dollars.

38:44.991 --> 38:48.989
Austin, as outgoing head of
household, you are not eligible

38:48.990 --> 38:49.990
to compete.

38:49.991 --> 38:55.989
This competition is called
"dizzyland" and the goal for

38:55.990 --> 38:56.990
everyone is the same.

38:56.991 --> 39:01.699
As you hit the hand, you will be
sent spinning.

39:01.700 --> 39:04.989
So you'll need to hold on for
dear life.

39:04.990 --> 39:09.989
Be the last person standing, and
you will be the new head of

39:09.990 --> 39:11.289
household.

39:11.290 --> 39:14.989
For the jurors, the last person
standing will be back in the

39:14.990 --> 39:16.989
game.

39:16.990 --> 39:17.990
Everyone understand?

39:17.991 --> 39:19.989
Yes.

39:19.990 --> 39:20.120
Yes.

39:20.121 --> 39:21.989
Julie: Excellent.

39:21.990 --> 39:25.989
Then hang on tight, houseguests,
because this competition begins

39:25.990 --> 39:33.989
now.

39:33.990 --> 39:39.699
So everyone understands, if the
last person standing out of

39:39.700 --> 39:44.539
everyone is a juror, that person
is not only back in the game.

39:44.540 --> 39:50.949
They also become the new head of
household.

39:50.950 --> 39:58.950
Good luck, houseguests and
jurors.

40:05.830 --> 40:06.999
Oh, that hand spins!

40:07.000 --> 40:08.989
Oh, my gosh!

40:08.990 --> 40:09.990
Yeah.

40:09.990 --> 40:10.990
O yeah.

40:10.991 --> 40:12.989
It pushes you inappropriately.

40:12.990 --> 40:15.829
It does!

40:15.830 --> 40:21.989
The second one is a slapper!

40:21.990 --> 40:25.989
Oh, my gosh!

40:25.990 --> 40:33.989
Aaahhh!

40:33.990 --> 40:34.000
Whoa!

40:34.001 --> 40:39.989
Whoa!

40:39.990 --> 40:43.989
Julie: I hear some
complaint, but you're all still

40:43.990 --> 40:44.990
hanging in there.

40:44.990 --> 40:45.990
How are you guys doing?

40:45.990 --> 40:46.990
Dizzy!

40:46.990 --> 40:47.540
Hanging in there.

40:47.541 --> 40:50.989
Julie: They don't call it
dizzyland for nothing.

40:50.990 --> 40:54.989
All four jurors have revenge on
their mind, but only one will

40:54.990 --> 40:56.989
win the chance to get it.

40:56.990 --> 41:01.989
We'll rejoin this all-important
competition when we return.

41:01.990 --> 41:02.990
Stay with us.

41:23.990 --> 41:25.989
Julie: Welcome back to
"Big Brother."

41:25.990 --> 41:27.989
The battle for head of household
is under way.

41:27.990 --> 41:32.989
Tune in Sunday to see who will
be the new h.O.H.

41:32.990 --> 41:35.119
Then Wednesday, the power of
veto is back up for grabs.

41:35.120 --> 41:40.989
And on Thursday, it is dwubl
eviction time once again.

41:40.990 --> 41:45.699
Two more houseguests are sent to
the jury and it will all happen

41:45.700 --> 41:45.990
after live.

41:45.991 --> 41:51.989
Tune in to "Big Brother after
dark" on poptv tonight to see

41:51.990 --> 41:53.989
who takes control of the house.

41:53.990 --> 41:56.989
To find your channel go to
poptv.Com.

41:56.990 --> 41:59.989
For now, let's rejoin the action
in the backyard.

41:59.990 --> 42:01.989
Hello, again, houseguests.

42:01.990 --> 42:02.990
Hi, Julie!

42:02.991 --> 42:07.989
Julie: In the last few
minutes since we spoke we have

42:07.990 --> 42:11.539
just lost Steve and we have lost
Julia in this competition and

42:11.540 --> 42:13.699
Meg has just fallen.

42:13.700 --> 42:17.989
So there are seven of you left
in this competition we're

42:17.990 --> 42:21.989
calling "dizzyland."

42:21.990 --> 42:26.989
All jurors are still left.

42:26.990 --> 42:29.989
It's going to be a long night,
everyone.

42:29.990 --> 42:30.830
Hang on tight.

42:30.831 --> 42:31.989
Good night, everyone.

42:31.990 --> 42:33.989
And good luck.

42:33.990 --> 42:35.990
Bye, Julie!
