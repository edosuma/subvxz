<i>No one can pinpoint</i>
<i>the exact moment it all fell apart.</i>

00:44.335 --> 00:45.920
<i>When emotions got too high…</i>

00:48.631 --> 00:50.050
<i>when the weapons came out…</i>

00:52.343 --> 00:54.262
<i>when the fear got the upper hand…</i>

00:57.223 --> 00:59.517
<i>when the leader</i>
<i>didn't have it in him anymore.</i>

01:13.990 --> 01:15.241
<i>Every bad decision…</i>

01:18.787 --> 01:19.954
<i>every wrong step…</i>

01:25.210 --> 01:26.920

01:31.382 --> 01:36.054
<i>Suspicion, guilt, lies.</i>

02:26.437 --> 02:29.774
<i>No one can pinpoint</i>

03:03.516 --> 03:06.019

03:06.102 --> 03:08.271
<i>I've rarely seem a hybrid storm like…</i>

03:08.354 --> 03:10.523
<i>…a trifecta of destruction.</i>

03:10.607 --> 03:12.525
<i>…calling it the perfect storm.</i>

03:12.609 --> 03:14.277
<i>Ocean surges coming…</i>

03:14.360 --> 03:17.030
<i>As Ignacio</i>
<i>leaves the city and heads north,</i>

03:17.113 --> 03:20.450
<i>we have reports of an explosion</i>
<i>at the Center Mall.</i>

03:21.034 --> 03:24.996
<i>All over the city,</i>
<i>there is utter devastation.</i>

03:25.079 --> 03:27.749
<i>Every street,</i>
<i>every place that you can see…</i>

03:27.832 --> 03:32.128
<i>Right here in Times Square,</i>
<i>so much of the island sitting in the dark,</i>

03:32.212 --> 03:33.880
<i>while glittering in the distance,</i>

03:33.963 --> 03:37.300
<i>the rest of the skyline</i>
<i>shining as it always has.</i>

03:42.513 --> 03:44.766
Where the fuck do you think you're going?

03:44.849 --> 03:45.767
We're blown.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.894
Three days, Tupper Lake.
It's not safe here.

03:47.977 --> 03:50.271
Get the bonds and take them to the fence.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.483
Where are the bonds?

03:53.566 --> 03:55.693
In the truck.
Where you were supposed to be.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.528
My job was to put them in the elevator.

03:57.612 --> 03:58.488
I did that. Okay?

03:58.571 --> 04:00.615
I go up, there's no bonds and no truck.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.784
Where's Ava? Weren't you with her?

04:02.867 --> 04:04.953
Where's Bob? Weren't you with him?

04:06.037 --> 04:08.581
Yeah.
Yeah, um, we got separated.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.501
-I thought he'd be back here.
-Well, nobody is.

04:11.584 --> 04:14.045
We take these passports,
we get out of here.

04:17.632 --> 04:21.094
I didn't do everything that I just did
to walk away with nothing.

04:21.177 --> 04:23.513
Until we've got those bonds,
no one's going anywhere.

04:23.596 --> 04:24.806
You think somebody screwed us?

04:24.889 --> 04:27.183
Because everyone's so fucking trustworthy?

04:29.310 --> 04:31.771
-What about the FBI, Leo?
-They must've heard the alarms.

04:31.854 --> 04:34.023
No, no. I heard it on the comms.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.276
The FBI showed up
before the alarms came on,

04:36.359 --> 04:38.111
which means that someone told them.

04:41.030 --> 04:42.740
Which means we've got a rat.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.094
Leo!

05:05.680 --> 05:06.597
Get in here!

05:07.140 --> 05:08.099
Man, relax!

05:09.225 --> 05:11.227
-Who was that?
-What, Damarion?

05:11.311 --> 05:12.729
What the fuck is a Damarion?

05:12.812 --> 05:15.690
It's cool. He's Hungarian.
He gave me this pear actually.

05:15.773 --> 05:18.484
-You had a friend drive you?
-No, of course not. Uh…

05:21.070 --> 05:22.071
Stan, did you…

05:25.199 --> 05:26.826
Did you Uber to the meet?

05:27.702 --> 05:28.661
I mean, it was Lyft

05:28.745 --> 05:31.122
'cause surge pricing
is ridiculous right now.

05:31.205 --> 05:33.458
Look, I don't know
how to hotwire a car. Okay?

05:33.541 --> 05:34.542
I'm not you.

05:34.625 --> 05:37.211
I have a fake account.
I use it to make drop-offs.

05:37.295 --> 05:38.588
Why didn't you take the truck?

05:38.671 --> 05:41.049
It wasn't there, man,
but I'll tell you who was.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.220
Look who decided to show up.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.140
Where's your husband?

05:50.475 --> 05:51.309
I don't know.

05:53.686 --> 05:54.937
What about RJ?

05:56.814 --> 05:58.107
Where's RJ, Judy?

06:05.114 --> 06:06.824
Leo doesn't have the bonds.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.579
You gotta be shitting me.

06:11.662 --> 06:12.997
All that was for nothing?

06:13.081 --> 06:17.085
That whole grade A,
prize-winning clusterfuck was for nothing?

06:17.168 --> 06:19.587
-Somebody's got the bonds--
-Yeah, someone's got them!

06:20.213 --> 06:22.298
-He's halfway to Fiji.
-Nobody is.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.841
I bet someone's on a plane right now

06:23.925 --> 06:26.636
with a mimosa in one hand
and a middle finger in the other.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.221
Bob didn't take the bonds!

06:28.304 --> 06:30.723
He's gonna try to kill us
and not take the bonds?

06:30.807 --> 06:32.892
How the fuck do you know that, Judy, huh?

06:44.070 --> 06:47.073
Roger? I got here as fast as I could.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.909
I saw them on the feed.

06:49.992 --> 06:51.452
They couldn't have gotten far.

06:51.536 --> 06:55.456
I just want to know who they are
and how the hell they got into my vault.

06:56.374 --> 06:59.210
Please check on every video feed,
every alarm log.

06:59.293 --> 07:00.962
Get a full systems analysis.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.338
-Okay.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.548
And a forensics team.

07:05.049 --> 07:06.634
Carlos, what the fuck happened?

07:06.717 --> 07:07.760
I…

07:07.844 --> 07:09.220
I had one of them.

07:09.303 --> 07:10.888
Did you recognize him?

07:11.389 --> 07:13.099
-They've been drugged.
-You think?

07:13.182 --> 07:15.184
Last six hours of video have been wiped.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.015
Whoa.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.685
Get a dive team. I want eyes inside now.

07:57.768 --> 08:01.439
The bond cases are waterproof.
The bonds themselves should be safe.

08:01.522 --> 08:03.691
You know what else
was supposed to be waterproof?

08:03.774 --> 08:05.526
The entire fucking vault!

08:10.907 --> 08:12.700
We have guests.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.869
-What's the FBI doing here?
-I don't know.

08:14.952 --> 08:16.746
-Get 'em out.
-They could be useful.

08:16.829 --> 08:19.040
Stefan Thiele has ears everywhere, Hannah,

08:19.123 --> 08:20.208
including the FBI.

08:20.291 --> 08:23.961
I don't want him getting wind of this
until I know those bonds are safe. Go.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.471
-I'm gonna find my way down.

08:33.554 --> 08:34.972
We have probable cause.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.935
Agent Abbasi, FBI.
We're looking for Roger Salas.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.812
Uh, I'm afraid Mr. Salas
is tied up at the moment.

08:41.896 --> 08:44.190
I'm Hannah Kim, head of digital security.

08:44.273 --> 08:46.400
We have reason to believe
your vault was robbed.

08:46.484 --> 08:47.652
How dramatic.

08:48.694 --> 08:51.447
But if we had been robbed,
I would be the first to know.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.950
We have informants inside the crew.

08:55.576 --> 08:59.914
I see. Well, fortunately,
everything down at SLS is safe and sound.

08:59.997 --> 09:03.334
Yet you're all here at 4:00 a.m.
In the tail of a hurricane.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.836
-If there'd been an attempt--
-Which there wasn't.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.798
Not telling us about it
would be obstruction of justice.

09:10.925 --> 09:13.761
Short of you coming back
with a warrant, I'm--

09:13.844 --> 09:16.806
Agents! Roger Salas.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.559
Thank you so much for checking on us.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.895
Luckily it's all just a false alarm,
some, uh, minor water damage.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.106
Well, we'd like to come down. Take a look.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.608
No, I'd be happy to let you
with advance notice.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.527
My clients are very private people.

09:29.610 --> 09:32.113
Can't allow just anyone inside.
You understand.

09:32.196 --> 09:34.282
We're not just anyone. We're the FBI.

09:34.365 --> 09:37.368
At certain levels,
the rest of us are all "just anyone."

09:45.126 --> 09:46.794
We've taken enough of your time.

09:52.049 --> 09:54.385
They don't have anything.
They're just fishing.

10:02.768 --> 10:04.395
Okay, so we can't get into SLS,

10:04.478 --> 10:06.814
but maybe we can
find the people who robbed it.

10:06.897 --> 10:09.483
Mercer's in the Con-Ed truck.
We can get on the traffic cam.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.111
-We could track her truck.
-Follow her to the meet.

10:13.571 --> 10:16.657
I'm sorry, buddy, but after tonight,
I don't trust any of you.

10:18.909 --> 10:22.830
Better you think you know somebody,
easier they can fool you.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.169
Three days. Tupper Lake.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.424
What? Without the bonds?

10:35.217 --> 10:38.179
It's not safe here.
What part of that aren't you getting?

10:38.262 --> 10:40.181
The part that's not leaving
without our money.

10:40.264 --> 10:42.099
We get the passports
once we have the bonds.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.226
-If Salas finds us--
-How's he going to find us?

10:44.310 --> 10:46.687
-There's no video, no prints.
-What about the vault?

10:46.771 --> 10:48.773
<i>It's basically</i>
<i>SeaWorld at this point.</i>

10:49.357 --> 10:51.734
<i>What if we left something</i>
<i>that can be connected to us?</i>

10:52.318 --> 10:55.237
<i>It was clean.</i>
<i>There's no way Salas can track us.</i>

11:00.034 --> 11:02.411
-<i>What about the amp?</i>

11:03.079 --> 11:06.499
<i>It's full-on</i>
<i>generic RadioShack gear. It's untraceable.</i>

11:08.709 --> 11:11.504
Stan, where are your glasses?

11:14.715 --> 11:15.549
No, I…

11:16.967 --> 11:17.885
I probably…

11:24.892 --> 11:25.893
Fuck!

11:31.190 --> 11:34.276
That's Ava Mercer, right?
Out of the gate at 3:23 a.m.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.529
Five minutes later,
she's at Essex and Delancey.

11:36.612 --> 11:41.117
Then, 3:41, she's uptown. 58 and Second.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.451
She's all over the place.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.912
-She's hurt, confused?

11:46.330 --> 11:49.083
Those are bridge entrances.
She's trying to get off the island.

11:49.166 --> 11:52.086
Keep tracking.
She'll lead us right to the crew.

12:11.188 --> 12:14.442
I've got lab techs coming to run DNA.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.788
Stefan, good to hear from you.

12:27.872 --> 12:30.708
<i>I understand there's been</i>
<i>a problem in the vault.</i>

12:30.791 --> 12:32.835
Not that I know of.

12:32.918 --> 12:37.173
Mr. Thiele, this is Hannah Kim.
The hurricane had no impact.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.091
<i>That's not what I'm led to believe.</i>

12:39.175 --> 12:42.344
-I don't know where you heard that.
<i>-I keep my eyes on my money.</i>

12:42.428 --> 12:45.765
Well, I can assure you, Stefan,
your bonds are safe and sound.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.016
<i>Ah.</i>

12:48.934 --> 12:52.188
<i>Good to hear.</i>
<i>I'll be by first thing in the morning.</i>

12:56.650 --> 12:58.319
<i>Who is Roger Salas?</i>

12:58.861 --> 13:01.280
As per his bio, he was born in Venezuela,

13:01.363 --> 13:04.492
spent his 30s in Japan
and didn't come to America till his 40s.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.912
Look at this.

13:07.995 --> 13:12.166
Salas' passport from Venezuela in 1994
and his current US passport.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.959
That's not the same guy.

13:14.043 --> 13:17.338
And none of it matches the information
he registered with the SEC.

13:22.510 --> 13:25.638
Hey, the whole crew's
somehow connected to Ray Vernon, right?

13:32.853 --> 13:35.856
-Some interesting old friends.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.115
Everything I've built…

13:47.368 --> 13:48.953
everything I've worked for…

13:51.330 --> 13:52.957
They'll enjoy destroying me.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.752
We will find who did this.
They're out there.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.212
I will get those bonds

13:59.046 --> 14:02.716
and I will make sure
that you get everything you deserve.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.539
That's the guy
who did my eye exam.

14:33.622 --> 14:36.876
Came in at 12:35, left by 1:18.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.128
-Exterior cameras.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.053
There.

15:01.108 --> 15:05.362
Okay, fine. Glasses.
But Salas can't track that, right?

15:05.446 --> 15:07.406
You don't know what he's capable of.

15:09.783 --> 15:13.996
Then maybe he's right.
It's a risk. Maybe we should go.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.124
Maybe we should go?

15:22.713 --> 15:25.466
Okay. Okay, you two
are in on this together.

15:25.549 --> 15:26.467
Excuse me?

15:26.550 --> 15:29.511
Yeah, you've got him,
he's got Ava, she's got the fence.

15:33.390 --> 15:35.976
Stan, you don't ever think
that he's playing you?

15:36.685 --> 15:40.397
Surrogate dad leading you down
whatever fucking path he wants?

15:40.481 --> 15:42.483
I'm not leading him anywhere.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.944
I don't know.
You've got secrets left and right.

15:45.027 --> 15:49.281
You really think I would
do you like that? After eight years?

15:49.365 --> 15:51.742
But what has he
actually told you, Stan?

15:52.952 --> 15:54.745
What do you actually know?

15:56.747 --> 15:57.623
She's right.

15:58.749 --> 15:59.750
Most I ever got

15:59.833 --> 16:02.169
was when you cried in your sleep
in Washington.

16:02.711 --> 16:04.088
Then I knew you were human.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.340
At least I'm not running
with a married woman.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.342
You don't know shit about what we've--

16:08.425 --> 16:09.969
I know what I see.

16:11.428 --> 16:12.680
We had what we had.

16:14.473 --> 16:18.143
When this is done, I'm going my way
and you are going to go yours.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.270
I don't know why I thought
it'd be different.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.314
You really think I'm screwing you over?

16:22.398 --> 16:24.358
Take my share, split it up.

16:24.441 --> 16:25.734
Split what up?

16:25.818 --> 16:27.903
He doesn't care about the money.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.616
It's never been about the money, has it?

16:35.619 --> 16:37.079
So what is it about, Leo?

16:38.789 --> 16:40.499
What'd we risk our lives for?

16:56.974 --> 16:58.100
We're closed.

17:04.982 --> 17:07.359
-Are you Mrs. Stan Loomis?
-Yeah.

17:09.778 --> 17:13.157
I am Detective Miguel Fuentes.
I'm looking for your husband.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.994
No, he's been off parole for years now.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.663
He's not in any trouble, ma'am.

17:20.164 --> 17:24.418
Mr. Loomis has been working with us
in an information capacity.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.171
We believe that he might be in danger.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.049
I'm looking to help.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.388
You're saying Stan's an informant?

17:37.639 --> 17:39.308
He never said nothing about that.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.060
Which makes him a good informant.

17:41.643 --> 17:44.605
We haven't been able to reach him,
I was hoping he was here.

17:44.688 --> 17:45.522
Well, he is not.

17:46.815 --> 17:47.691
No one is.

17:47.775 --> 17:50.360
Hello? Barbara?

17:50.444 --> 17:52.654
It's nothing, Barbara! Go back to bed!

17:52.738 --> 17:55.032
Are you talking about my Stan?

17:55.699 --> 17:56.950
No one, huh?

18:01.580 --> 18:05.042
This gentleman says he's looking for Stan.

18:05.667 --> 18:08.962
I am Detective Fuentes.
You must be Stan's mother.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.422
He told me all about you.

18:10.506 --> 18:14.176
Oh, he's a good boy.
His father, God rest his soul--

18:14.259 --> 18:16.804
We're trying to find him.
We're worried about him.

18:16.887 --> 18:19.973
I told Detective Fuentes
we don't know where Stan is.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.850
You got that phone thing.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.811
Find Me A Phone or whatever.

18:25.771 --> 18:26.605
'Course.

18:29.316 --> 18:30.567
Let me go get it.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.869
Stan's going to be so sad
that he missed you.

18:45.332 --> 18:46.166
Yeah.

18:47.251 --> 18:51.213
I can't find him. It must be the storm.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.923
Must have knocked out reception.

18:53.006 --> 18:55.592
Yeah, I hate to think of him
all alone out there.

18:56.176 --> 18:58.762
Especially with the people
that he's dealing with.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.097
Can be unpredictable.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.349
I got it on my phone, too.

19:02.432 --> 19:05.435
I bet he's probably
playing poker with his friends.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.834
<i>Okay. Thank you, Carlos.</i>

19:31.378 --> 19:34.464
So Carlos has tracked him
to an auto shop in Red Hook.

19:35.299 --> 19:36.341
Oh.

19:36.425 --> 19:37.759
He's gathering his men.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.928
What's he going to do?

19:40.470 --> 19:43.724
Carlos will do what Carlos does.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.395
Is that the best option?

19:49.146 --> 19:50.898
We're way past options.

20:02.409 --> 20:04.536
I think I have enough on Salas
to take to a judge.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.205
Mercer's made it to Brooklyn.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.040
If we go now, we can find the crew.

20:09.499 --> 20:11.084
Can't be in two places at once.

20:14.379 --> 20:15.881
We're going to need some help.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.133
Soon as I make this call,

20:19.551 --> 20:21.678
everything we've done,
everything off-book,

20:21.762 --> 20:22.930
it's going to come out.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.350
I've been buried in this thing too long.
I've…

20:26.934 --> 20:28.769
I've lost way too much to stop now.

20:29.436 --> 20:30.646
You're still coming up.

20:31.438 --> 20:32.856
You have a career.

20:32.940 --> 20:37.569
Whatever happens to me happens to me,
but you don't have to take the fall.

20:45.118 --> 20:47.579
Make the call. Send in a squad.

21:15.190 --> 21:17.067
We can argue about this all you want.

21:17.901 --> 21:20.153
Once Roger sics Carlos on us,
we're done for.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.488
Unless he's your inside man.

21:21.571 --> 21:23.031
You're not thinking straight.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.449
I'm clear as day.

21:24.533 --> 21:28.996
You got the inside man. You got Ava.
She's got the fence. That's all you need.

21:29.079 --> 21:31.415
If I hadn't stopped you,
you'd have left us.

21:46.054 --> 21:48.348
Ava, you got hit. Are you okay?

21:48.432 --> 21:49.599
You look terrible.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.393
-Come on, over my shoulder.
-Yeah.

21:55.355 --> 21:56.773
-You okay?
-Yeah, I got her.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.775
-I'm okay.
-How bad is it? Do you know?

21:58.859 --> 22:01.153
It just grazed me. I'm all right.

22:01.236 --> 22:03.447
-Easy, easy, easy.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.745
-Okay, just stay there.
-I'm okay. I'll sit up.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.122
-Who popped you?

22:12.873 --> 22:15.751
SLS guards. They kept coming.

22:16.501 --> 22:17.711
The truck's hot.

22:17.794 --> 22:18.837
We're made.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.173
Let's load this in the cars and get out.

22:21.256 --> 22:24.343
I gotta admit, I thought
you'd be halfway to Mexico by now.

22:24.426 --> 22:27.804
-I'm Argentinian.
-Oh, that's right. Excellent beef.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.266
So why'd you take the truck?

22:31.350 --> 22:33.769
It had the bonds and everyone was gone.

22:33.852 --> 22:36.980
The truck was there,
the bonds were there, but none of you.

22:37.064 --> 22:37.898
RJ?

22:39.358 --> 22:40.192
Bob?

22:42.444 --> 22:43.653
He's gone, Judy.

22:43.737 --> 22:44.988
What do you mean by gone?

22:45.489 --> 22:49.493
I saw him in the road. Bob's dead.

22:53.622 --> 22:54.456
I'm sorry.

23:00.253 --> 23:01.254
How'd he die?

23:01.755 --> 23:04.716
No idea. I just saw him there.

23:05.258 --> 23:06.593
Was he bleeding or was--

23:06.676 --> 23:09.054
He was dead. Dead-dead.

23:09.137 --> 23:10.597
No, was he shot?

23:10.680 --> 23:12.307
Shut the fuck up, Stan!

23:19.272 --> 23:20.399
No!

23:21.483 --> 23:22.317
No.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.782
Fuck! Fuck, fuck!

23:35.247 --> 23:36.331
I knew you'd fuck us!

23:36.415 --> 23:37.958
Why'd I show up with fakes?

23:38.041 --> 23:40.168
-To claim innocence.
-They're in on it together.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.003
You took the bonds to the elevator.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.756
You had 'em for two hours,
so don't you start that!

23:44.840 --> 23:46.716
Where were you when the FBI came in?

23:46.800 --> 23:49.845
Oh, so am I a backstabber or an FBI mole?

23:49.928 --> 23:51.346
Who says you can't be both?

23:51.430 --> 23:53.849
What about RJ? He's the only one not here.

23:53.932 --> 23:56.143
-Maybe he's got the bonds.
-It's not RJ.

23:56.226 --> 23:59.604
Tell ya what. I'm gonna take my real bonds
and my fake passport,

23:59.688 --> 24:01.398
and get the fuck away from all of you.

24:01.898 --> 24:03.233
That's community property.

24:03.316 --> 24:05.026
Don't you point that thing at her.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.571
Enough, all of you.

24:32.846 --> 24:35.849
-Tell us where you put them.
-She doesn't have the bonds.

24:35.932 --> 24:37.934
How do you know? How do you really know?

24:39.227 --> 24:40.353
Maybe Salas switched it out.

24:40.437 --> 24:42.272
-Someone tipped him.
-Nobody tipped anybody.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.151
Cover! Get out!

25:13.136 --> 25:14.638
Drop your weapons.

25:14.721 --> 25:15.555
Shit.

25:18.892 --> 25:20.477
Drop your weapons or he dies.

25:24.606 --> 25:27.150
Drop 'em. Now.

25:29.277 --> 25:30.445
Kick them away.

25:37.369 --> 25:38.620
The fuck is this shit?

25:42.207 --> 25:43.875
Where are the rest of the bonds?

25:43.959 --> 25:45.335
We don't have them.

25:46.169 --> 25:47.295
Hey, hey, hey!

25:47.379 --> 25:48.713
-Bonds.

25:49.631 --> 25:53.927
The first shot will go through his ankles,
the second through his knees,

25:54.010 --> 25:55.262
and I'll work my way up

25:55.345 --> 25:57.597
until you tell me where the bonds are.

25:58.265 --> 25:59.933
And I hope it takes a long time--

26:00.016 --> 26:02.018
I'll tell you everything. Don't hurt him.

26:02.102 --> 26:02.936
Shut up, Judy!

26:03.687 --> 26:05.438
In a storage locker in Bensonhurst.

26:05.522 --> 26:06.648
I put the key in the office.

26:06.731 --> 26:08.608
I can show you where. Don't hurt him.

26:08.692 --> 26:09.901
Go, now!

26:10.443 --> 26:12.404
Fuck! Shit! God!

26:12.487 --> 26:17.867
Shut up, you fool. You dumb fucking bitch.
You're such a fucker. Shut up!

26:18.660 --> 26:20.829
Fucking bitch. Motherfucker.

26:42.934 --> 26:44.060
Let's get out of here.

27:35.945 --> 27:36.780
Come on.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.808
I can stay until the vault's drained.

28:04.891 --> 28:07.602
No, no. I think we got it handled.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.313
The storm has passed.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.773
Mm-hmm.

28:12.816 --> 28:13.983
You got a ride?

28:14.067 --> 28:15.860
Yeah, my sister's nearby.

28:17.362 --> 28:20.156
Oh, good morning, Glen.
I'm surprised to see you here!

28:20.782 --> 28:22.325
The city never stops.

28:30.583 --> 28:32.293
We live to fight another day.

28:32.377 --> 28:33.920
We most certainly do.

28:54.149 --> 28:54.983
How'd it go?

28:55.567 --> 28:57.527
Just drive.

29:10.915 --> 29:11.750
Agents.

29:11.833 --> 29:12.792
Mr. Salas.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.170
Nice to see you again.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.255
We discussed a warrant.

29:18.882 --> 29:20.967
This gives us the right
to search all property

29:21.050 --> 29:22.844
expressly owned by you or SLS,

29:22.927 --> 29:24.471
including the private vaults.

29:28.349 --> 29:29.309
That it does.

29:30.351 --> 29:36.733
Well, I'll be very happy
to show you every one.

29:57.504 --> 30:01.800
So, as I said,
some, uh, mild water damage.

30:02.801 --> 30:06.429
Nothing to worry about,
unless the FBI has a plumber on staff.

30:13.561 --> 30:14.687
The safes are empty.

30:14.771 --> 30:17.607
Yeah. We moved our clients' assets
to a secure location

30:17.690 --> 30:19.275
to protect against the weather.

30:27.116 --> 30:28.326
What about that one?

30:29.160 --> 30:31.454
That is my own private vault.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.499
I promise you
no one else has been in there.

30:34.582 --> 30:36.417
Let's open it. Just to be sure.

30:39.128 --> 30:39.963
Okay.

31:23.047 --> 31:26.301
Would you mind telling me
why that is in your personal safe?

31:31.389 --> 31:32.932
I'd like to call my attorney.
