WEBVTT

00:11.500 --> 00:13.500
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:13.533 --> 00:14.833
SHE CUT HIS LVAD WIRE.

00:14.867 --> 00:18.200
(Miranda) DENNY DUQUETTE DIED
AT 7:42 THIS EVENING.

00:18.233 --> 00:20.167
I HAD A BABY
AND I WENT SOFT.

00:20.200 --> 00:23.067
YOUR HAND IS FINE, AND SHEPHERD
WILL CLEAR YOU FOR SURGERY.

00:23.100 --> 00:25.800
OUR MARRIAGE IS OVER.
YEAH, I GUESS IT IS.

00:25.833 --> 00:28.167
WHO AM I TO YOU, GEORGE?
AM I YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

00:28.200 --> 00:29.800
AM I SOMEBODY
YOU MESS AROUND WITH?

00:29.833 --> 00:32.267
CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK, CALLIE?
ONLY IF YOU HAVE IT DELIVERED
TO MY HOTEL ROOM,

00:32.300 --> 00:33.833
BECAUSE I'M OFF TO BED.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.500
YOU ARE A GREAT GUY.
SO IT'S DEREK.

00:36.533 --> 00:38.600
(Finn) HE'S GONNA
HURT YOU AGAIN.
I'M WALKIN' AWAY.

00:38.633 --> 00:40.333
IT'S FOR YOU.
IT'S FROM DENNY.

00:43.200 --> 00:46.567
***

00:46.600 --> 00:49.467
(Meredith) FIRST DO NO HARM--

00:49.500 --> 00:52.300
AS DOCTORS, WE PLEDGE
TO LIVE BY THIS OATH.

00:52.333 --> 00:54.267
BUT HARM HAPPENS...

00:54.300 --> 00:56.700
AND THEN GUILT HAPPENS.

00:56.733 --> 00:59.767
AND THERE'S NO OATH
FOR HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT.

00:59.800 --> 01:00.867
(Izzie) MORNING.

01:00.900 --> 01:02.833
I THOUGHT WE WERE DONE
WITH THE WHOLE MUFFIN THING.

01:02.867 --> 01:04.767
THIS ISN'T MUFFINS.
THIS IS BREAKFAST.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.300
HMM.
MER NEEDS
A GOOD, SOLID BREAKFAST.

01:07.333 --> 01:09.533
FIRST DAY BACK
AFTER THE BIG SURGERY.

01:09.567 --> 01:11.767
ARE YOU OKAY?

01:11.800 --> 01:14.167
OF COURSE I'M OKAY.
I'M A MILLIONAIRE. FRUIT?

01:14.200 --> 01:16.200
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK
ABOUT B&Bs?

01:16.233 --> 01:18.133
I'M THINKING ABOUT OPENING
A B&B IN VERMONT

01:18.167 --> 01:21.100
WHERE THE FOLIAGE IS,
YOU KNOW?

01:21.133 --> 01:23.533
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO BACK
TO BED.
CAN'T. I'M GOING TO
THE HOSPITAL.

01:23.567 --> 01:25.700
ARE YOU GONNA GO
TALK TO THE CHIEF?

01:25.733 --> 01:28.433
NOPE. GOING TO
CLEAN OUT MY LOCKER.

01:28.467 --> 01:30.733
I COULD BUY A HOTEL. HOW MUCH
DO YOU THINK A HOTEL COSTS? OOH.

01:30.767 --> 01:33.300
(gasps) IZZIE!
IS THAT...

01:33.333 --> 01:34.400
THAT IS $8 MILLION.

01:34.433 --> 01:36.833
$8 MILLION DOES NOT LIKE
TO HAVE JUICE SPILLED ON IT.

01:36.867 --> 01:39.800
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT
TO THE BANK TODAY.

01:39.833 --> 01:42.233
IT'S MAKING ME NERVOUS
IN THE HOUSE.

01:42.267 --> 01:44.100
I WILL, AS SOON AS
I CLEAN OUT MY LOCKER.

01:44.133 --> 01:45.667
I AM FINE.

01:45.700 --> 01:46.833
REALLY, I AM FINE.

01:46.867 --> 01:48.800
DENNY LOVED ME.

01:48.833 --> 01:50.667
HE WANTED ME TO HAVE
THIS MONEY.

01:50.700 --> 01:52.733
HE WANTS ME TO BE HAPPY.

01:52.767 --> 01:54.400
SO I'M HAPPY.

01:54.433 --> 01:56.333
JUICE?

01:56.367 --> 01:58.533
***

01:58.567 --> 02:00.067
(Meredith) SHE'S LOSING IT.

02:00.100 --> 02:01.433
SHE ALMOST BATTERED
AND DEEP FRIED

02:01.467 --> 02:04.100
AN $8 1/2-MILLION CHECK
THIS MORNING.

02:04.133 --> 02:06.067
THAT KIND OF MONEY,
I'D BUY MY OWN HOSPITAL

02:06.067 --> 02:08.100
AND STOCK IT
FULL OF SICK PEOPLE.

02:08.133 --> 02:11.067
VALVULOPLASTIES
AND RUPTURED ANEURYSMS... MM.

02:11.067 --> 02:12.800
YOU'RE A PSYCHO.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

02:12.833 --> 02:14.767
I'M NOT THE ONE WITH
AN $8 1/2-MILLION CHECK

02:14.800 --> 02:17.567
I WON'T CASH.
(Izzie) STOP TALKING
ABOUT ME.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.633
I'M FINE.

02:19.667 --> 02:22.400
I AM CLEANING OUT MY LOCKER
AND I AM GOING HOME.

02:22.433 --> 02:24.500
MER IS THE ONE
WITH THE PROBLEMS.

02:24.533 --> 02:26.333
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

02:26.367 --> 02:28.267
WELL, NOW YOU HAVEN'T
TOLD McDREAMY

02:28.300 --> 02:29.333
THAT YOU DUMPED McVET.

02:29.367 --> 02:31.267
OH, YOU HAVEN'T
DONE THAT YET?

02:31.300 --> 02:33.167
DUDE, TELL HIM ALREADY.
SHE'S SCARED.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.567
I AM NOT SCARED.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.733
DEREK WALKED AWAY.
HE WALKED AWAY.

02:36.767 --> 02:38.367
AND MAYBE THAT'S
A GOOD THING.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.300
I MEAN, MAYBE HE'S HAPPIER.
MAYBE HE'S MOVED ON.

02:40.333 --> 02:42.267
HE'S GOT ADDISON HERE.
HE'S GOT MARK HERE.

02:42.300 --> 02:44.200
HE'S... GOT A LOT
TO DEAL WITH.

02:44.233 --> 02:46.533
AND I'M NOT GONNA
MAKE HIM FEEL GUILTY.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.333
I MEAN, I AM BEING
AN ADULT HERE.

02:48.367 --> 02:51.800
AND I AM NOT GOING TO
DRAG HIM INTO OUR WHOLE...

02:51.833 --> 02:54.133
IZZIE IS THE ONE
WITH THE BIG CHECK.

02:54.167 --> 02:56.067
I'M FINE.

02:56.100 --> 02:59.467
GUILT NEVER GOES ANYWHERE
ON ITS OWN.

02:59.500 --> 03:03.567
IT BRINGS ITS FRIENDS
DOUBT AND INSECURITY.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.733
(cell phone rings)

03:05.767 --> 03:07.700
IS THAT
YOUR BOYFRIEND AGAIN?

03:07.733 --> 03:09.633
I DO NOT HAVE
A BOYFRIEND.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.567
THEN WHY THE GUILTY FACE?

03:11.600 --> 03:14.433
(sighs) YOU WERE SEXIER
WHEN YOU WEREN'T TALKING.

03:14.467 --> 03:17.467
(Miranda) AM I KEEPING YOU,
O'MALLEY?

03:19.100 --> 03:21.133
M&M IN 15 MINUTES, PEOPLE.

03:21.167 --> 03:23.067
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WE GET TO GO TO M&M?

03:23.100 --> 03:25.100
EVEN IF WE HAVEN'T
FINISHED OUR ROUNDS?
EVEN IF.

03:25.133 --> 03:28.733
I WANT ALL OF YOU
AT THE M&M TODAY.
YES!

03:28.767 --> 03:31.500
PEOPLE DIE IN THIS HOSPITAL
ON OUR WATCH.

03:31.533 --> 03:34.400
ONCE A MONTH, WE MEET TO DISCUSS
HOW OUR ACTIONS AS PHYSICIANS

03:34.433 --> 03:36.067
CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEATHS.

03:36.067 --> 03:38.067
THIS IS A SERIOUS EXERCISE.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.300
(man) DR. BAILEY.

03:39.333 --> 03:41.200
GEORGE, ALEX, YOU GUYS
GET GOOD SEATS.

03:41.233 --> 03:44.067
MER AND I WILL GET SNACKS.
YEAH.

03:44.067 --> 03:46.633
UH, MR. AND MRS. NILES.
WE KINDA GOT TURNED AROUND
ON OUR WAY TO ADMITTING.

03:46.667 --> 03:48.067
OH, OH, NOT A PROBLEM.

03:48.067 --> 03:49.633
DR. KAREV, UH,

03:49.667 --> 03:51.800
MRS. NILES IS SCHEDULED
FOR A MASTECTOMY TOMORROW.

03:51.833 --> 03:54.600
UH, WHY DON'T YOU SHOW HER
AND HER HUSBAND

03:54.633 --> 03:56.500
UP TO THE FIFTH FLOOR?
IS THIS THE LITTLE MAN?
(laughs)

03:56.533 --> 03:59.067
HE IS ADORABLE.
HE'S NOT SO ADORABLE

03:59.100 --> 04:00.833
AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING
WHEN HE'S SCREAMING

04:00.867 --> 04:02.767
AND WON'T TAKE A BOTTLE.
CAN WE JUST GET TO THE ROOM?

04:02.800 --> 04:04.333
IT'S BEEN KIND OF
A ROUGH WEEK.

04:04.367 --> 04:06.633
SHE HAD TO STOP NURSING.
GUS HERE JUST WON'T EAT.

04:06.667 --> 04:09.533
HERE. WHY DON'T
I TAKE YOU UP?
THERE YOU GO.

04:09.567 --> 04:10.667
YEAH. YEAH.

04:10.700 --> 04:12.733
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN TRY
A LITTLE SUGAR WATER

04:12.767 --> 04:16.700
ON THE BOTTLE,
JUST UNTIL HE GETS USED TO IT.

04:16.733 --> 04:18.633
DOES THAT WOMAN
HAVE BREAST CANCER?

04:18.667 --> 04:21.233
WHAT IS SHE, 30 YEARS OLD?

04:21.267 --> 04:22.567
IT'S A NEW BABY.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.333
PROBABLY THOUGHT THE LUMP
WAS A MILK DUCT.

04:24.367 --> 04:25.467
HMM?

04:25.500 --> 04:27.667
YOU LEARN THINGS
ON THE VAGINA SQUAD.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.167
OKAY, YEAH, FOCUS, PEOPLE.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.100
M&M--INSULTS FLYING,
RESIDENTS COVERING THEIR ASSES,

04:31.133 --> 04:34.600
OUR BOSSES GETTING KICKED
IN THE TEETH INSTEAD OF US.

04:34.633 --> 04:36.067
SEATS, THEN SNACKS.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.600
COME ON.

04:37.633 --> 04:40.500
HEY. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
COMING TO THE M&M.

04:40.533 --> 04:41.700
YOU BROUGHT SNACKS?

04:41.733 --> 04:45.600
WELL... YEAH.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.333
YOU OKAY?

04:47.367 --> 04:48.300
FINE.

04:48.333 --> 04:49.467
HEY, NO SURGERIES TODAY,
RIGHT?

04:49.500 --> 04:51.767
I MEAN, I'M READY
IF YOU NEED ME.

04:51.800 --> 04:56.067
NO. NO SURGERIES.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.667
CALLIE. HEY.

05:03.700 --> 05:06.700
HI. DID YOU GET MY MESSAGE--
MY MESSAGES?

05:06.733 --> 05:08.633
YEAH. I GOTTA GET A SEAT.

05:08.667 --> 05:12.133
ALEX IS SAVING US A BUNCH
IF YOU WANT TO SIT WITH US.
NO.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.833
SHE'S TRYING TO MAKE ME
FEEL GUILTY

05:20.867 --> 05:23.067
ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT
ABOUT THE IZZIE THING.

05:23.067 --> 05:24.800
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU APOLOGIZED ALREADY?

05:24.833 --> 05:26.833
I DID. I HAVE.

05:26.867 --> 05:28.367
I'M DONE.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.200
I-I AM NOT APOLOGIZING
ANYMORE.

05:31.233 --> 05:33.500
I'M ENJOYING LIFE.
I'M LOVING THE M&M.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.433
(Richard) OKAY, PEOPLE,
LET'S BEGIN.

05:35.467 --> 05:38.767
PATIENT 34986
DIED LAST MONTH

05:38.800 --> 05:42.200
FROM COMPLICATIONS
FOLLOWING A HEART TRANSPLANT.

05:42.233 --> 05:43.700
DR. BURKE WILL PRESENT.

05:47.167 --> 05:48.700
YOU GUYS...

05:48.733 --> 05:51.400
ISN'T PATIENT 34986...

05:51.433 --> 05:52.367
DENNY.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.533
$8 MILLION...

05:53.567 --> 05:55.467
$8 MILLION
COULD GET US ON A PLANE

05:55.500 --> 05:57.733
TO SOMEWHERE FAR, FAR AWAY.

06:22.500 --> 06:26.267
CAUSE OF DEATH AT AUTOPSY
WAS AN EMBOLUS THAT DISLODGED

06:26.300 --> 06:28.200
FROM THE SUTURE LINE
OF THE TRANSPLANT

06:28.233 --> 06:31.267
AND CAUSED A C.V.A.
WITH BRAIN STEM HERNIATION.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.133
SO THE COMPANY LINE IS THAT
HE DIED OF A C.V.A.?

06:35.167 --> 06:37.833
THERE'S NO COMPANY LINE.
THAT'S WHAT HE DIED OF.

06:37.867 --> 06:40.667
UH, YES, LET'S GET BACK
TO THIS, UH, PATIENT'S NEED

06:40.700 --> 06:42.233
FOR AN EMERGENT TRANSPLANT.

06:42.267 --> 06:45.333
YOU'RE SAYING
THAT HIS LEFT VENTRICLE

06:45.367 --> 06:48.067
HAD BEEN WEAKENED BY
THE LVAD MALFUNCTION?

06:48.100 --> 06:49.833
(Preston) HIS LEFT VENTRICLE
WAS WEAKENED

06:49.867 --> 06:52.200
BY THE FACT THAT HE SUFFERED
FROM CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.

06:52.233 --> 06:53.733
(man)
OH, COME ON, DR. BURKE.

06:53.767 --> 06:56.100
WE ALL KNOW THE LVAD
WAS CUT BY AN INTERN.

06:56.133 --> 06:58.733
OH, I'M GOING TO
MY HAPPY PLACE.

06:58.767 --> 07:00.567
THE EXACT CHAIN OF EVENTS
REMAIN UNCLEAR.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.533
IT REMAINS UNCLEAR TO YOU
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN THE E.R.

07:02.567 --> 07:04.267
WITH A GUNSHOT WOUND.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.200
WHY AREN'T WE HEARING
FROM DR. BAILEY?

07:06.233 --> 07:08.633
SHE WAS THE SENIOR PHYSICIAN
ON THE CASE.

07:08.667 --> 07:10.533
I AM THE ATTENDING
ON RECORD.
YES...

07:10.567 --> 07:13.133
I WAS THE RESIDENT
IN CHARGE.

07:21.167 --> 07:22.667
UH...

07:22.700 --> 07:26.500
DR. BURKE HAS SUMMARIZED
THE MEDICAL FACTS OF THIS CASE.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.067
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS
FOR ME?

07:38.833 --> 07:41.200
YOU RECENTLY HAD A BABY,
DR. BAILEY?

07:41.233 --> 07:43.400
I DON'T SEE WHAT THAT
HAS TO DO WITH--

07:43.433 --> 07:45.600
SLEEP DEPRIVATION COUPLED WITH
WILD SWINGS IN HORMONE LEVELS

07:45.633 --> 07:48.200
ARE FACTORS THAT COULD
CLOUD ANYONE'S JUDGMENT.

07:48.233 --> 07:50.133
I SLEEP JUST FINE,
DR. SAVOY.

07:50.167 --> 07:51.267
REALLY?

07:51.300 --> 07:53.833
'CAUSE IF A PATIENT DIED
DUE TO MY POOR DECISION MAKING,

07:53.867 --> 07:56.100
I'D PROBABLY LOSE AT LEAST
A LITTLE SLEEP OVER IT.

07:56.133 --> 07:58.133
LET ME REMIND EVERYONE

07:58.167 --> 07:59.833
THAT OUR PURPOSE HERE
IS NOT TO PLACE BLAME.

07:59.867 --> 08:02.733
THIS IS A FORUM TO DISCUSS
MISTAKES IN PATIENT CARE

08:02.767 --> 08:04.767
AND LEARN FROM THEM.

08:04.800 --> 08:07.533
WELL, SO FAR, I HAVEN'T HEARD
DR. BAILEY ADMIT TO A MISTAKE.

08:07.567 --> 08:10.233
WHY DON'T THEY JUST PUT A BULLET
IN THE BACK OF HER HEAD?

08:10.267 --> 08:12.833
IT WOULD BE MORE HUMANE.
(Savoy) SO FOR A PERIOD
OF SEVERAL HOURS,

08:12.867 --> 08:14.800
YOUR INTERNS WERE RUNNING AMOK
IN THE HOSPITAL,

08:14.833 --> 08:17.167
TOTALLY UNSUPERVISED.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.533
I'M WAITING FOR A QUESTION.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.467
THE QUESTION IS
WHERE WERE YOU?

08:21.500 --> 08:25.433
THERE WAS THE SHOOTING,
AND THE E.R. WAS CHAOTIC.

08:25.467 --> 08:27.067
THE E.R. IS ALWAYS CHAOTIC.

08:27.100 --> 08:28.833
DID YOU PAGE THEM
DURING THIS TIME?

08:28.867 --> 08:30.500
YES, I PAGED THEM
MULTIPLE TIMES.

08:30.533 --> 08:32.067
WELL, APPARENTLY,

08:32.067 --> 08:34.567
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS OKAY
TO IGNORE YOUR PAGES.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.533
DOCTOR, WHY DO YOU THINK
YOUR INTERNS

08:36.567 --> 08:38.667
HAVE SUCH CONTEMPT
FOR YOUR AUTHORITY?

08:38.700 --> 08:41.367
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!

08:41.400 --> 08:43.267
DR. KAREV, SIT DOWN.

08:43.300 --> 08:46.433
(indistinct murmuring)

08:50.333 --> 08:52.233
(whispers) IZZIE.

08:57.067 --> 08:59.567
NEXT QUESTION.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.500
DEREK SAYS
THAT NEITHER OF YOU

09:01.533 --> 09:03.700
BROUGHT ANY ASSETS
INTO THE MARRIAGE.
MM-HMM.

09:03.733 --> 09:06.600
WELL, I HAD MY TRUST FUND
AND A SPARKLING PERSONALITY...

09:06.633 --> 09:09.200
OH, AND THE FUTON COUCH.

09:09.233 --> 09:12.300
YES, ADDISON HAD A VERY UGLY,
VERY HEAVY FUTON COUCH.

09:12.333 --> 09:14.367
WHAT EVER HAPPENED
TO THAT COUCH?
WE GAVE IT TO MARK.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.167
OH.
SHE CAN HAVE HIM.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.767
I DON'T WANT HIM.
OKAY, WELL,
THAT'S SETTLED. WHAT ELSE?

09:18.800 --> 09:20.600
SO ASIDE FROM ADDISON'S
TRUST FUND,

09:20.633 --> 09:22.533
WHICH REMAINS IN HER NAME,
YOU'LL SPLIT EVERYTHING--

09:22.567 --> 09:24.467
STOCKS, BONDS, 401Ks--
DOWN THE MIDDLE.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.533
THE ONLY THAT GETS
A LITTLE COMPLICATED

09:26.567 --> 09:27.733
IS THE REAL ESTATE.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.667
LET ME MAKE THIS,
UH, SIMPLE.

09:29.700 --> 09:32.567
I'D LIKE TO KEEP MY TRAILER
AND THE LAND IN SEATTLE.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.500
ADDISON CAN HAVE THE REST.
HOLD ON.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.433
THAT'S THE HOUSE
IN THE HAMPTONS

09:36.467 --> 09:38.633
AND THE BROWNSTONE
OVERLOOKING CENTRAL PARK?

09:38.667 --> 09:40.167
THAT'S VERY GENEROUS,
DR. SHEPHERD.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.133
THANK YOU.
HOLD ON.
HE'S UP TO SOMETHING.

09:42.167 --> 09:44.067
NO, I'M NOT.
I CAME HERE TO FIGHT
OVER CDs AND BOOKS,

09:44.100 --> 09:46.133
GO TO WAR
OVER A CRYSTAL VASE.

09:46.167 --> 09:48.100
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO, DEREK?
THE DIVORCE IS MY FAULT.
LET ME TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.

09:48.133 --> 09:49.733
WE BOTH HAD AFFAIRS.

09:49.767 --> 09:51.733
YOU HAD A ONE-NIGHT STAND
WITH MARK.

09:51.767 --> 09:54.533
DEREK, ACTUALLY...
WELL, IT WAS--

09:54.567 --> 09:57.833
OH, OKAY, IT WAS TWO NIGHTS.
YOU MADE A MISTAKE.

09:57.867 --> 10:00.400
MEREDITH AND I,
WE HAD A RELATIONSHIP.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.500
MAKE THESE CHANGES,
AND I'LL SIGN IT TODAY.

10:05.733 --> 10:08.100
(Meredith) YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE IN HERE, IZZIE.

10:08.133 --> 10:10.133
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
HAD TO SEE THAT.

10:10.167 --> 10:13.033
NO, IT'S FINE. I'M FINE.

10:13.067 --> 10:16.733
CLEARLY THE DOCTOR THING
WAS NOT WORKING FOR ME.

10:16.767 --> 10:19.367
SO GO ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.333
RUN LABS, CURE CANCER.
I'M FINE.

10:21.367 --> 10:23.800
YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME.

10:23.833 --> 10:26.167
EITHER YOU HANG OUT WITH US
OR WE'LL CALL YOUR MOTHER.

10:26.200 --> 10:29.067
OOH.
SHE'S JUST
A FEW HOURS AWAY,

10:29.100 --> 10:31.733
AND I'M SURE SHE WOULDN'T MIND
COMING AND STAYING WITH YOU,

10:31.767 --> 10:33.800
ALL DAY.
YOU WOULDN'T.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.433
DIALING.
WHOA. HEY, HEY.

10:35.467 --> 10:37.267
OKAY.

10:37.300 --> 10:39.500
I'LL JUST...

10:39.533 --> 10:42.667
GO HANG OUT
IN THE LOCKER ROOM.

10:55.067 --> 10:56.800
(Richard)
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

10:56.833 --> 11:00.233
SHE HAS NO BUSINESS
IN THIS ROOM.

11:01.567 --> 11:03.767
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
AT ME FOR?

11:03.800 --> 11:05.600
I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

11:05.633 --> 11:09.400
I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH ANY OF THIS.

11:09.433 --> 11:11.200
I'LL STAY WITH HER TODAY,
IF THAT'S OKAY.

11:11.233 --> 11:13.433
I'LL UPDATE CHARTS
AND I'LL RUN LABS

11:13.467 --> 11:15.400
AND JUST KEEP AN EYE ON HER,
IF THAT'S OKAY.

11:15.433 --> 11:17.133
SHE SHOULDN'T BE ALONE.

11:17.167 --> 11:18.333
(Richard) FINE.

11:20.867 --> 11:23.067
DR. BAILEY...
WE JUST WANNA SAY...

11:23.067 --> 11:24.700
WE'RE REALLY SORRY...
(Meredith) ABOUT THE M&M.

11:24.733 --> 11:28.333
NO, YOU DO NOT GET
TO APOLOGIZE TO ME FOR THIS.

11:28.367 --> 11:30.200
YOU DO NOT
GET TO FEEL BETTER.

11:30.233 --> 11:32.433
NEITHER DO I.
GET TO WORK.

11:32.467 --> 11:35.500
O'MALLEY, JUST KEEP
AN EYE ON HER.

11:35.533 --> 11:37.467
YES, DR. BAILEY.

11:42.533 --> 11:45.833
DR. BAILEY, YOU UNDERSTAND.
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.

11:45.867 --> 11:48.533
PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT
YOUR HORMONE LEVELS

11:48.567 --> 11:50.467
STARTS FEELING
PRETTY PERSONAL.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.633
HEY, DR. BAILEY. LOOK,
YOU'RE THE BABY WHISPERER.

11:53.667 --> 11:55.167
GUS HERE DRANK
THE WHOLE BOTTLE.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.167
HERE,
YOU WANT TO HOLD HIM?

11:57.200 --> 11:59.100
UH, ACTUALLY NOW
ISN'T A GOOD TIME.

11:59.133 --> 12:00.467
I'M ABOUT TO GO
AND GET YOUR WIFE'S LABS.

12:00.500 --> 12:03.300
OH, YEAH. UH... DO YOU, UH,
THINK YOU COULD TALK TO HER?

12:03.333 --> 12:04.833
SHE'S KIND OF FREAKING OUT.

12:04.867 --> 12:06.767
SHE'S NOT TOO SURE
ABOUT THE MASTECTOMY.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.833
SHE'S THINKING MAYBE
A LUMPECTOMY.

12:08.867 --> 12:11.567
I KNOW SHE LIKES YOU.
MAYBE YOU COULD TALK HER INTO--

12:11.600 --> 12:14.467
OH, NO, NO. IT'S NOT MY JOB
TO TALK HER INTO ANYTHING.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.700
MAYBE IF SHE KNEW MORE ABOUT
HER RECONSTRUCTIVE OPTIONS...

12:16.733 --> 12:19.600
UM, I'LL SEND
OUR PLASTIC SURGEON UP.

12:19.633 --> 12:22.367
(chuckles)

12:28.267 --> 12:29.633
HEY, CHIEF.

12:29.667 --> 12:31.133
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

12:31.167 --> 12:33.500
SURE. THAT WAS QUITE
A MORNING, HUH?

12:33.533 --> 12:34.833
IT WAS.

12:34.867 --> 12:36.833
IT'S ALWAYS GOOD
TO BE REMINDED

12:36.867 --> 12:39.733
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO BE
AT THE TOP OF YOUR GAME.

12:39.767 --> 12:42.233
THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

12:42.267 --> 12:44.233
I AM SO GLAD YOU ARE BACK
IN THIS BUILDING.

12:44.267 --> 12:46.167
I NEED YOUR HELP
FOCUSING THE STAFF.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.267
THEY RESPOND TO YOU
AS AN AUTHORITY FIGURE.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.200
I MEAN, YOU'RE AN EXAMPLE
OF WHAT THEY SHOULD BE--

12:50.233 --> 12:51.367
A LEADER.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.067
I'M GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK,
PRESTON.

12:54.100 --> 12:56.800
THANK YOU, CHIEF.

13:03.667 --> 13:05.200
YOU'RE BACK.

13:05.233 --> 13:06.633
I AM.

13:06.667 --> 13:09.567
YOU LOOK, UH, GOOD
WITHOUT AN APPENDIX.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.133
IT SUITS YOU.

13:11.167 --> 13:12.467
HOW ARE YOU?

13:12.500 --> 13:14.233
FINE.

13:14.267 --> 13:17.067
HOW ARE YOU?

13:17.100 --> 13:18.267
I'M GREAT.

13:18.300 --> 13:20.733
FEELING WELL? NO PAIN?

13:20.767 --> 13:22.100
NO PAIN.

13:22.133 --> 13:23.767
(pager beeps)

13:23.800 --> 13:25.433
OH.

13:25.467 --> 13:28.733
THAT'S YOUR WIFE.
I'M ON HER SERVICE.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.467
OH. OKAY, THEN.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.733
I WON'T
STAND IN YOUR WAY.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.333
OKAY.

13:42.233 --> 13:45.067
HI. I WAS PAGED BY
DR. MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD.

13:45.100 --> 13:46.467
DR. GREY.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.800
WELCOME BACK.

13:47.833 --> 13:49.367
THANK YOU.

13:49.400 --> 13:52.267
AND, UH, IT'S JUST
MONTGOMERY NOW.
WHAT?

13:52.300 --> 13:54.333
MY NAME. THE DIVORCE
WAS FINALIZED THIS MORNING.

13:54.367 --> 13:56.600
SO... MONTGOMERY.

13:56.633 --> 13:59.500
TO ADD TO OUR FUN,
WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO CONSULT

13:59.533 --> 14:01.433
ON A CASE WHERE A WOMAN

14:01.467 --> 14:04.233
HAS A FOREIGN OBJECT
STUCK INSIDE OF HER. AHEM.

14:04.267 --> 14:05.633
(man) AH!

14:05.667 --> 14:08.100
(woman) ADAM, OW!
IT HURTS WHENEVER YOU MOVE.

14:08.133 --> 14:10.067
WELL, THEN KEEP YOUR WEIGHT
OFF MY BAD KNEE.

14:10.067 --> 14:13.067
I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT
IT WAS ON THE LEFT SIDE.

14:13.067 --> 14:16.433
19 YEARS OF MARRIAGE, YOU'D
THINK YOU'D HAVE THAT ONE DOWN.

14:16.467 --> 14:18.600
IT APPEARS THAT HER HUSBAND
IS THE FOREIGN OBJECT.

14:18.633 --> 14:20.467
EX-HUSBAND.
EX-HUSBAND.

14:21.633 --> 14:24.233
OOH!
OH.

14:26.767 --> 14:28.667
(woman) YOU HAD TO GO
AND GET A PIERCING.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.167
(Adam) SONJA.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.700
WHAT? IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE
NOT GOING TO FIND OUT.

14:32.733 --> 14:34.367
THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.600
NO. EMBARRASSING IS MEETING
YOUR HUSBAND FOR LUNCH

14:36.633 --> 14:39.667
WITH YOUR EX-HUSBAND
STILL ATTACHED.

14:39.700 --> 14:42.133
HOW LONG IS THIS GONNA TAKE?

14:42.167 --> 14:44.500
BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T WANT
MY HUSBAND FINDING OUT.

14:44.533 --> 14:47.233
PLEASE, COULD YOU WORK OUT
SOME SMALL MIRACLE?

14:47.267 --> 14:49.633
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

14:49.667 --> 14:51.533
WHAT THE PIERCING
IS CAUGHT ON.
OKAY.

14:51.567 --> 14:53.833
DO YOU HAVE ANY PIERCINGS?

14:53.867 --> 14:55.667
ME? NO!
OW!

14:55.700 --> 14:57.067
(whispers) I'M SORRY.

14:57.100 --> 14:59.300
(normal voice)
I SELL REAL ESTATE.

14:59.333 --> 15:02.167
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
I SELL REAL ESTATE, TOO.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.633
WE'VE BEEN DIVORCED
FOR FIVE YEARS.

15:04.667 --> 15:07.333
BUT WE KEEP RUNNING INTO
EACH OTHER,

15:07.367 --> 15:09.067
YOU KNOW, WORK STUFF.

15:09.100 --> 15:10.833
WE GET TOGETHER SOMETIMES.
(clears throat)

15:10.867 --> 15:13.333
IT'S STUPID AND WEAK,

15:13.367 --> 15:15.567
AND IT IS
NEVER HAPPENING AGAIN.

15:15.600 --> 15:18.500
OKAY, WELL, DR. GREY IS
GOING TO CHECK ON THE X-RAYS,

15:18.533 --> 15:21.067
AND THEN--THEN WE'LL TAKE IT
FROM THERE, OKAY?

15:21.100 --> 15:24.533
BUT, UM, YOU--YOU MIGHT WANT
TO CANCEL YOUR LUNCH PLANS.

15:24.567 --> 15:26.233
(knock on door)

15:26.267 --> 15:27.667
HEY.

15:27.700 --> 15:30.067
THAT M&M WAS--

15:30.067 --> 15:31.267
YEAH.

15:33.167 --> 15:36.300
I WENT TO TELL THE CHIEF...

15:36.333 --> 15:38.200
ABOUT MY HAND.

15:38.233 --> 15:40.067
OH.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.700
BURKE, HOW--HOW DID...

15:41.733 --> 15:43.767
BUT I COULDN'T.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.400
I...

15:46.433 --> 15:49.233
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

15:49.267 --> 15:52.133
WELL, I-I CAN BE THERE
IF YOU NEED ME IN SURGERY.

15:52.167 --> 15:55.067
I'M NOT GOING TO DO
ANY SURGERIES.

15:55.100 --> 15:57.800
I'M GONNA CATCH UP
ON PAPERWORK.

15:57.833 --> 16:00.267
WAIT, SO--SO WHAT
DOES THAT MEAN? THAT--
I DON'T KNOW.

16:00.300 --> 16:03.600
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

16:03.633 --> 16:06.500
I NEED TIME TO THINK.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.333
I HAVE...

16:08.367 --> 16:09.800
PAPERWORK.

16:09.833 --> 16:13.067
I NEED TO DO PAPERWORK.

16:14.667 --> 16:16.667
I KNOW HOW THE RUMOR MILL WORKS
AROUND HERE, GEORGE, OKAY?

16:16.700 --> 16:18.600
I'M THE CRAZY INTERN,
AND NOW I'M THE CRAZY INTERN

16:18.633 --> 16:20.333
WHOSE FRIENDS
HAVE TO BABYSIT HER.

16:20.367 --> 16:22.267
YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD
TALK ABOUT

16:22.300 --> 16:24.067
IS WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO
WITH ALL THAT MONEY

16:24.067 --> 16:26.300
ONCE YOU DEPOSIT THE CHECK AFTER
WE DON'T LET YOU DESTROY IT.
(Sonja) DON'T MOVE, ADAM.

16:26.333 --> 16:27.800
WHOA!
(Adam) I'M NOT MOVING.

16:27.833 --> 16:30.167
WOW. ARE THOSE PEOPLE
HAVING SEX?
(Sonja) JUST LAY STILL.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.500
THEY WERE HAVING SEX.
NOW THEY'RE JUST FIGHTING.

16:32.533 --> 16:35.567
GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK,
STEVENS.
I'M NOT BACK.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.700
I'M FINE,
JUST NOT BACK.

16:37.733 --> 16:40.400
HEY, YOU'RE ADDISON FORBES
MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.333
THAT'S A LOT OF NAMES,
A LOT OF RICH SOUNDING NAMES.

16:42.367 --> 16:44.267
YOU'RE RICH, RIGHT?

16:44.300 --> 16:46.433
(chuckles)
OH, THAT'S RUDE.
THAT'S A RUDE QUESTION.

16:46.467 --> 16:48.333
I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST THAT
I'M RICH NOW, TOO.

16:48.367 --> 16:50.267
YOU'RE NOT RICH UNTIL
YOU DEPOSIT THE CHECK.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.500
DO YOU EVER FEEL GUILTY?
I'M SORRY.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.433
BEING RICH. 'CAUSE I HAVE
ALL THIS MONEY NOW,

16:54.467 --> 16:56.367
AND I DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE
I DID ANYTHING TO DESERVE IT,

16:56.400 --> 16:58.300
AND I CAN'T REALLY TALK
TO MY FRIENDS ABOUT IT...

16:58.333 --> 16:59.833
(lowers voice)
'CAUSE THEY'RE ALL SO POOR.

16:59.867 --> 17:01.767
STANDING RIGHT HERE,
IZZIE.

17:01.800 --> 17:05.133
DEPOSIT THE CHECK, STEVENS.

17:05.167 --> 17:07.467
JUST START THERE, OKAY?

17:07.500 --> 17:13.067
AND, UM, THE GUILT
WILL WORK ITSELF OUT.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.767
HEY.
YOU'RE EVERYWHERE.

17:20.800 --> 17:24.700
WELL, I'M SORRY. FOR ONCE,
IT WAS ACTUALLY NOT ON PURPOSE.

17:26.267 --> 17:29.333
DO THESE LOOK BLURRY
TO YOU?

17:31.400 --> 17:33.333
WHAT EXACTLY
AM I LOOKING AT?

17:33.367 --> 17:35.233
A DIVORCED COUPLE WHO GOT
STUCK TOGETHER DURING--

17:35.267 --> 17:37.167
OH, WOW. THAT'S GOTTA BE
PRETTY AWKWARD.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.500
YEAH. DIVORCED FIVE YEARS,
AND STILL GOING AT IT

17:39.533 --> 17:40.800
LIKE TEENS AT THE PROM...

17:40.833 --> 17:42.467
SO TO SPEAK.

17:42.500 --> 17:43.533
MM.

17:45.333 --> 17:47.467
SPEAKING OF DIVORCE...

17:47.500 --> 17:50.200
I HEARD BECAUSE
I'M WORKING WITH YOUR WIFE.

17:50.233 --> 17:51.700
MM.
EX-WIFE.

17:51.733 --> 17:53.433
IT WAS TIME.

17:53.467 --> 17:55.433
GOOD.

17:55.467 --> 17:57.267
HOW'S FINN?

17:57.300 --> 18:01.667
FINN IS... FINE.

18:01.700 --> 18:03.600
***

18:03.633 --> 18:04.667
GOOD.

18:05.867 --> 18:08.833
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THEY'RE BLURRY.

18:08.867 --> 18:11.133
YOU SHOULD GET
SOME NEW ONES.

18:13.667 --> 18:16.133
IF YOU GO AHEAD
WITH THE MASTECTOMY,

18:16.167 --> 18:18.100
THERE ARE SEVERAL
RECONSTRUCTIVE OPTIONS.

18:18.133 --> 18:19.800
SALINE IMPLANTS
ARE USED MOST OFTEN,

18:19.833 --> 18:22.700
BUT SILICONE HAS A MORE
NATURAL LOOK AND FEEL.

18:22.733 --> 18:25.700
I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS
RIGHT NOW.

18:25.733 --> 18:26.667
(Gus cries)

18:26.700 --> 18:29.067
DIANA, COME ON.
IT'LL TAKE TWO SECONDS, HUH?

18:29.067 --> 18:31.133
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO HAS TO
FEEL THEM, SO YOU DECIDE.

18:31.167 --> 18:32.467
I DON'T CARE.

18:32.500 --> 18:35.067
DUDE, BELIEVE ME,
YOU CARE.
DR. KAREV.

18:35.067 --> 18:38.633
DUDE, HE'S RIGHT.
YOU CARE.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.433
DR. BAILEY?

18:49.467 --> 18:52.100
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY WIFE?

18:52.133 --> 18:53.667
I'M... SORRY.

18:53.700 --> 18:57.533
UH, AS YOU KNOW, SHE HAS
STAGE IIB BREAST CANCER.

18:57.567 --> 18:59.100
I KNOW THAT.

18:59.133 --> 19:01.600
WILL YOU PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER?

19:01.633 --> 19:03.200
MR. NILES--

19:03.233 --> 19:04.733
'CAUSE SHE WON'T.

19:04.767 --> 19:06.667
SHE WON'T TALK TO ME.
I'VE TRIED, AND I'M TRYING.

19:06.700 --> 19:08.600
AND I KNOW THIS SUCKS,
AND IT'S SCARY,

19:08.633 --> 19:10.567
BUT WE CAN DO THIS.
WE CAN FIGHT THIS.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.167
BUT SHE WON'T.
SHE WON'T EVEN LOOK AT GUS.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.467
SHE WON'T HOLD HIM,
AND ALL HE WANTS IS HIS MOM.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.400
HE'S JUST--
SHE'S SUCH A GOOD MOM.

19:16.433 --> 19:18.333
I KNOW IT DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE THAT,

19:18.367 --> 19:21.133
BUT SHE IS.

19:21.167 --> 19:24.433
OKAY, I CAN SCHEDULE
A PSYCH CONSULT.

19:24.467 --> 19:28.400
I DON'T WANT
A PSYCH CONSULT.

19:28.433 --> 19:31.067
I JUST WANT MY WIFE BACK.

19:31.067 --> 19:32.367
(Gus cries)

19:32.400 --> 19:33.533
PLEASE.

19:33.567 --> 19:35.067
NOW SHE'S TALKING CRAZY,

19:35.100 --> 19:37.667
HOW SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE
THE SURGERY AT ALL.

19:37.700 --> 19:39.633
MR. NILES--

19:39.667 --> 19:43.467
CAN YOU PLEASE TELL HER THAT
SHE HAS TO HAVE THE SURGERY?

19:43.500 --> 19:46.400
PLEASE.
SOMEBODY HAS TO TELL HER.

19:46.433 --> 19:49.100
(Gus cries)

19:49.133 --> 19:51.233
I DID THIS FOR YOU,
YOU KNOW?

19:51.267 --> 19:54.333
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE GOT TO
STOP DOING THINGS FOR ME.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.833
I'M WITH TOM NOW.
I LOVE TOM.

19:55.867 --> 19:58.667
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU LEFT ME FOR THAT GUY.

19:58.700 --> 20:01.567
WH-WHAT DOES TOM HAVE
THAT I DON'T, HUH?

20:01.600 --> 20:03.400
WELL, HE DOESN'T HAVE
A PIERCED--

20:03.433 --> 20:05.333
YOU TWO NEED TO STAY
COMPLETELY STILL

20:05.367 --> 20:08.467
SO THAT WE CAN GET
A CLEAR PICTURE.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.467
WE FOUGHT THROUGH 19 YEARS
OF MARRIAGE.

20:11.500 --> 20:14.500
THE ONLY TIME WE DIDN'T FIGHT

20:14.533 --> 20:16.767
WAS WHEN WE WERE HAVING SEX.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.133
(sobs) THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I STILL LOVE YOU.

20:19.167 --> 20:21.600
OKAY, I-I'M IN HELL.

20:21.633 --> 20:23.067
MOM.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.067
DAD!

20:24.100 --> 20:25.600
SCRATCH THAT.

20:25.633 --> 20:28.033
NOW I'M IN HELL.

20:28.067 --> 20:30.433
OH, GOD.

20:32.367 --> 20:35.200
JENNIFER, MAYBE YOU WANT
TO GO WAIT IN THE--

20:35.233 --> 20:37.533
YOU GUYS ARE SO PAYING
FOR MY THERAPY

20:37.567 --> 20:40.133
AND MY RENT...
AND A NEW CAR.
(pager beeps)

20:40.167 --> 20:42.633
OF COURSE, SWEETIE.
OH, GO AHEAD. CODDLE HER.

20:42.667 --> 20:45.467
YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW
THAT YOUR PARENTS

20:45.500 --> 20:48.667
ARE SEXUAL BEINGS
AND THAT THEY MAKE MISTAKES.

20:48.700 --> 20:51.367
OH, IS THAT WHAT YOU
CALL THIS, MOM, A MISTAKE?

20:51.400 --> 20:54.267
BECAUSE I CALL THIS YOU,
ONCE AGAIN, BEING A SLUT.

20:54.300 --> 20:56.733
HEY! YOU DON'T TALK TO ME
LIKE THAT. I AM YOUR MOTHER!

20:56.767 --> 20:58.767
YEAH, AND WHAT A GREAT ROLE
MODEL YOU'VE TURNED OUT TO BE.

20:58.800 --> 21:02.200
LOOK AT YOU--CHEATING ON YOUR
HUSBAND WITH YOUR EX-HUSBAND.

21:02.233 --> 21:04.467
GOD! AND, DADDY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:04.500 --> 21:07.067
I THOUGHT--I THOUGHT
YOU HAD FINALLY MOVED ON.

21:07.067 --> 21:10.800
YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA
START DATING.
IT'S COMPLICATED, HONEY.

21:10.833 --> 21:16.233
WELL, IT SEEMS THAT YOUR I.U.D.
HAS DISLODGED FROM YOUR UTERUS,

21:16.267 --> 21:18.067
HOOKED ON TO
YOUR HUSBAND'S PIERCING

21:18.100 --> 21:20.200
AND IS EMBEDDED
IN YOUR VAGINAL WALL.

21:20.233 --> 21:22.400
DID SHE SAY "PIERCING"?

21:22.433 --> 21:24.100
DAUGHTER.

21:24.133 --> 21:25.433
PERFECT.

21:27.833 --> 21:28.767
HEY.

21:28.800 --> 21:29.733
HEY.

21:29.767 --> 21:31.667
SO... WHO GOT
THE BROWNSTONE?

21:31.700 --> 21:33.367
YOU HEARD?

21:33.400 --> 21:35.300
PEOPLE TALK AROUND HERE.
I LISTEN.

21:35.333 --> 21:36.500
WHO GOT THE BROWNSTONE?

21:36.533 --> 21:38.200
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

21:38.233 --> 21:40.133
I LEFT MY BIKE
IN THE BASEMENT.

21:40.167 --> 21:43.133
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHO TO
TALK TO TO GET IT BACK.
BUY A NEW BIKE.

21:43.167 --> 21:45.067
YOU KNOW, THIS
ANGRY DIVORCéE THING

21:45.100 --> 21:47.233
REALLY TURNS ME ON.

21:48.833 --> 21:49.967
I GOT THE BROWNSTONE.

21:50.067 --> 21:53.200
AND YOU'LL GET YOUR BIKE BACK
WHEN YOU COME TO YOUR SENSES

21:53.233 --> 21:54.600
AND GO BACK HOME.

21:54.633 --> 21:57.067
DEREK TOOK THE HAMPTONS?

21:57.067 --> 21:58.500
DEREK HATES THE HAMPTONS.

21:58.533 --> 22:01.500
DEREK GAVE YOU
THE HAMPTONS, TOO?

22:01.533 --> 22:03.567
HE STILL DOESN'T KNOW
THE WHOLE STORY, DOES HE?

22:03.600 --> 22:06.067
NO.
AND AS LONG
AS YOU DON'T TELL HIM,

22:06.067 --> 22:08.200
YOU GET TO BE THE GOOD GUY,
AND I'M JUST THE CHUMP

22:08.233 --> 22:10.233
WHO SEDUCED HIS WIFE
FOR THE HELL OF IT.

22:10.267 --> 22:12.067
REAL FAIR.

22:12.067 --> 22:13.800
***

22:13.833 --> 22:17.467
I THINK I'M GONNA BUY SOMETHING
FOR BAILEY AND FOR BURKE.

22:17.500 --> 22:20.333
WHAT DO YOU THINK BURKE
WOULD WANT?
NOTHING YOU CAN GET
WITH MONEY.

22:20.367 --> 22:22.233
HE LIKES JAZZ.
I'M NOT BUYING HIM
A CD, GEORGE.

22:22.267 --> 22:23.467
I'M A MULTIMILLIONAIRE.

22:23.500 --> 22:25.733
I NEED TO BUY HIM
SOMETHING... BIG.

22:25.767 --> 22:28.167
A HOUSE... IN THE BAHAMAS.

22:28.200 --> 22:31.333
I'D BUY THE BAHAMAS,
OR AT LEAST A BAHAMA.

22:31.367 --> 22:32.833
AN ISLAND. YOU KNOW,
FOR $8 MILLION,

22:32.867 --> 22:34.700
I'D BUY AN ISLAND.
OH, YOU'RE AN INTERN.

22:34.733 --> 22:36.633
WHEN WOULD YOU HAVE TIME
TO GO TO YOUR BAHAMA?

22:36.667 --> 22:38.267
I'D QUIT.
OH, NO, YOU WOULDN'T.

22:38.300 --> 22:41.167
YOU'RE A SURGEON. YOU OPERATE.
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.633
***

22:43.667 --> 22:44.700
SORRY.

22:44.733 --> 22:46.267
(Izzie) WHAT?

22:46.300 --> 22:48.433
IT'S FINE. I'M FINE.

22:48.467 --> 22:50.500
I AM NOT A SURGEON.

22:50.533 --> 22:53.100
MY PATIENT? 30 YEAR OLD
WITH ADVANCED BREAST CANCER.

22:53.133 --> 22:56.467
I SAY LIVE YOUR LIFE
WHILE YOU CAN IN THE BAHAMAS.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.600
HAVE YOU TOLD DEREK YET
THAT YOU BROKE UP WITH FINN?

22:59.633 --> 23:02.233
I'M GIVING HIM TIME.
THAT'S STUPID.

23:02.267 --> 23:03.700
YOU KNOW WHAT'S STUPID?

23:03.733 --> 23:06.367
IS CARRYING AROUND A CHECK
FOR $8 MILLION.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.400
(sighs) I'M FINE.

23:08.433 --> 23:12.600
THE CHECK IS FINE.
WE'RE ALL FINE, OKAY?

23:12.633 --> 23:15.433
***

23:21.267 --> 23:23.133
I SLEPT WITH ANOTHER GUY.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.200
DO I TELL GEORGE?

23:27.233 --> 23:29.133
***

23:29.167 --> 23:32.467
I, UM... BROKE UP WITH FINN.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.833
DO I TELL DEREK?

23:34.867 --> 23:37.733
***

23:37.767 --> 23:40.500
I CAN'T TELL DEREK.

23:40.533 --> 23:43.100
I HAVE TO TELL GEORGE.

23:43.133 --> 23:47.067
***

23:48.133 --> 23:50.833
HONEY, PLEASE, AT LEAST
HOLD GUS. NO, DON'T--

23:50.867 --> 23:52.767
STOP IT.
WILL YOU AT LEAST
TALK TO ME?

23:52.800 --> 23:54.567
I WANT YOU
TO LEAVE ME ALONE.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.333
YOU--
(Gus cries)

23:56.367 --> 23:58.267
PLEASE, PLEASE.

23:58.300 --> 24:02.167
YOU TOOK A LOT OF HITS
TODAY AT THAT M&M.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.433
SOME OF 'EM JUSTIFIED,

24:04.467 --> 24:06.367
SOME OF 'EM NOT.

24:06.400 --> 24:10.100
COMPASSION AND EMPATHY
ARE A BIG PART OF THE JOB.

24:10.133 --> 24:12.667
LOOK, I DON'T CARE
WHAT SAVOY SAID,

24:12.700 --> 24:15.567
AND I KNOW I HAVEN'T ALWAYS
BEEN SUPPORTIVE,

24:15.600 --> 24:20.300
BUT BEING A PARENT
MAKES YOU A BETTER DOCTOR.

24:31.300 --> 24:34.633
(knock on door)

24:34.667 --> 24:36.300
HI. I JUST...

24:36.333 --> 24:38.767
WANTED TO SAY HI.

24:38.800 --> 24:41.167
DENNY LEFT ME $8 MILLION--

24:41.200 --> 24:43.433
$8.7 MILLION TO BE EXACT.

24:43.467 --> 24:45.600
DID YOU KNOW
THAT HE HAD MONEY?

24:45.633 --> 24:47.300
'CAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW.

24:47.333 --> 24:49.400
NO, I DIDN'T KNOW.

24:49.433 --> 24:51.333
I'M THINKING ABOUT
USING IT TO TRAVEL,

24:51.367 --> 24:52.833
MAYBE GO TO ITALY.

24:52.867 --> 24:55.067
I'VE NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE.
I HEAR VENICE IS AMAZING.

24:55.067 --> 24:55.800
IZZIE--

24:55.833 --> 24:58.833
I'M FINE.
REALLY, I AM. I'M FINE.

24:58.867 --> 25:00.833
EVERYONE THINKS I'M NOT.
EVERYONE THINKS I'M...

25:00.867 --> 25:02.567
BUT I'M FINE.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.667
YOU'RE FINE.

25:04.700 --> 25:06.133
I'M FINE.

25:06.167 --> 25:08.600
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

25:10.500 --> 25:11.767
SO...

25:11.800 --> 25:14.333
I GOT SHOT.

25:14.367 --> 25:16.633
I GOT SHOT BECAUSE I WAS
COMING BACK TO THE HOSPITAL

25:16.667 --> 25:18.567
TO CHECK ON DENNY

25:18.600 --> 25:22.633
BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME TO.

25:22.667 --> 25:24.367
I'M NOT FINE.

25:24.400 --> 25:27.567
DENNY ASKED YOU TO MARRY HIM,
AND NOW HE IS DEAD.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.467
YOU'RE NOT FINE.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.633
DON'T COME IN HERE AND...

25:34.500 --> 25:36.767
JUST...

25:36.800 --> 25:39.400
WE'RE NOT FINE.

25:39.433 --> 25:43.167
I'M SORRY.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.500
WE WERE FRIENDS.

25:44.533 --> 25:47.600
YOU WERE MY BOSS, BUT...

25:47.633 --> 25:49.767
I THINK WE WERE FRIENDS, TOO.

25:49.800 --> 25:52.533
AND--AND I NEVER MEANT...

25:52.567 --> 25:54.833
FOR ANYONE TO GET HURT.

25:54.867 --> 25:58.333
AND I KNOW THERE IS NOTHING
I CAN DO TO TAKE IT BACK.

25:58.367 --> 25:59.700
NO.

25:59.733 --> 26:01.733
PRESTON, PLEASE--

26:01.767 --> 26:03.500
YOU QUIT.

26:03.533 --> 26:06.067
YOU QUIT...

26:06.067 --> 26:07.767
BEING A SURGEON.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.800
YOU HAVE TWO GOOD HANDS...

26:10.833 --> 26:13.533
AND YOU AREN'T USING THEM.

26:13.567 --> 26:15.767
FEEL GUILTY ABOUT THAT.

26:23.533 --> 26:25.233
(sighs)

26:25.267 --> 26:26.433
SONJA, QUIT GRABBING MY LEG.

26:26.467 --> 26:29.300
I AM NOT GRABBING YOU
ANYWHERE. SHE IS.

26:29.333 --> 26:31.233
MR. MORRIS, WE NEED TO
POSITION YOU CORRECTLY

26:31.267 --> 26:33.267
IN ORDER TO GET
A CLEAR IMAGE.

26:33.300 --> 26:36.500
DR. YANG, MOVE HIM
A LITTLE TO THE LEFT.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.567
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

26:42.600 --> 26:44.500
OH, I HEARD ABOUT IT.

26:44.533 --> 26:47.067
I HAD TO SEE IT.

26:47.800 --> 26:50.667
AND I'VE SEEN ENOUGH.

26:50.700 --> 26:52.633
Dr. Yang, I need you
to lift him a little

26:52.667 --> 26:55.100
as you pull him.
TRYING.

26:55.133 --> 26:57.733
AH.
Now lift his right leg
20 degrees.

26:57.767 --> 26:59.633
(Adam) OW!
(Sonja) OW!

26:59.667 --> 27:01.067
PAIN!

27:01.067 --> 27:03.067
Freeze! Hold that position.

27:03.100 --> 27:05.500
Okay, now, Dr. Grey, can you
kind of slowly

27:05.533 --> 27:09.333
swirl Mrs. Kellman in
a counterclockwise direction?

27:09.367 --> 27:11.200
SWIRL?
SWIRL?

27:11.233 --> 27:12.300
SWIRL.

27:12.333 --> 27:14.567
Swirl.

27:18.067 --> 27:19.100
OH, MY GOD, SONJA.

27:19.133 --> 27:21.133
OH, GOD, ADAM. NOT NOW.

27:21.167 --> 27:23.067
(Richard) Careful. Careful.
OH, MY GOD.

27:23.067 --> 27:25.300
OH, MY GOD.
(Addison)
Okay, now, Grey, Yang,

27:25.333 --> 27:27.500
on the count of three,
I want you to slowly,

27:27.533 --> 27:29.400
gently pull them apart.

27:29.433 --> 27:31.700
One, two, three.

27:31.733 --> 27:33.067
(Sonja screams)

27:33.100 --> 27:34.467
(gasps)

27:34.500 --> 27:36.533
OH, OKAY. HE'S HAVING A--
SONJA!

27:36.567 --> 27:39.100
HEART ATTACK! HE'S HAVING
A HEART ATTACK!

27:39.133 --> 27:41.367
OH, THANK GOD.
I MEAN, CODE BLUE.

27:43.867 --> 27:45.800
OH, HE'S TEARING THROUGH
HIS AORTA.

27:45.833 --> 27:48.467
WE NEED TO GET HIM TO
AN O.R. NOW, OR HE'S GONNA DIE.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.067
WHO'S THE CARDIOTHORACIC
SURGEON ON CALL?
DR. HARRISON. BUT HE'S
IN THE MIDDLE OF SURGERY.

27:51.100 --> 27:52.467
WHERE'S BURKE?

27:52.500 --> 27:55.733
HE'S IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM,
BUT HE'S NOT ON THE BOARD YET.

27:55.767 --> 27:58.633
WELL, HE IS NOW. NOTIFY THE O.R.
LET'S MOVE, PEOPLE.

27:58.667 --> 28:00.167
COME ON. GO, GO, GO.

28:07.200 --> 28:08.567
HOW DO WE DO THIS?

28:08.600 --> 28:10.500
YOU STAND ON MY RIGHT SIDE.
ON YOUR RIGHT SIDE...

28:10.533 --> 28:12.433
AND IF AT ANY TIME
DURING THE PROCEDURE--
IF YOU TREMOR...

28:12.467 --> 28:13.600
I'LL LOOK AT YOU.

28:13.633 --> 28:17.400
YOU'LL KNOW TO SLIDE IN TO DO
THE SUTURES WE'VE PRACTICED.

28:18.633 --> 28:20.533
WHAT IF ONE OF
THE SCRUB NURSES NOTICES?

28:20.567 --> 28:23.067
WHAT IF THEY SAY SOMETHING?

28:23.100 --> 28:25.133
CRISTINA, I CAN'T WALK AWAY
FROM THIS SURGERY.

28:25.167 --> 28:27.300
IF I DO,
THAT MAN IN THERE WILL DIE.

28:27.333 --> 28:29.233
SO TREMOR OR NO TREMOR,
I HAVE TO TRY.

28:29.267 --> 28:30.333
BUT YOU--

28:30.367 --> 28:32.700
I'M YOUR INTERN.

28:32.733 --> 28:36.367
I WILL BE THERE
ON YOUR RIGHT SIDE.

28:51.533 --> 28:53.133
10 BLADE.

29:03.333 --> 29:06.200
(Addison) AS SOON AS WE HEAR
SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR EX-HUSBAND,

29:06.233 --> 29:08.133
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW.

29:08.167 --> 29:09.367
SINCE I REMOVED YOUR I.U.D.,

29:09.400 --> 29:11.600
YOU MAY WANT TO USE
A BACKUP METHOD.

29:11.633 --> 29:13.800
OH, I DOUBT I'LL BE
HAVING SEX ANYTIME SOON

29:13.833 --> 29:15.733
ONCE I TELL TOM.

29:15.767 --> 29:20.067
YOU'RE--YOU'RE GONNA TELL
YOUR HUSBAND?

29:20.100 --> 29:22.767
YOU KNOW, THE FIRST TIME
IT HAPPENED,

29:22.800 --> 29:25.800
I FELT SO GUILTY,
AND I WASN'T GONNA TELL TOM

29:25.833 --> 29:28.433
BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER
GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.633
AND THEN IT HAPPENED AGAIN

29:30.667 --> 29:33.300
AND AGAIN.

29:33.333 --> 29:35.233
AND THEN SOMEWHERE
ALONG THE WAY,

29:35.267 --> 29:38.500
I JUST
STOPPED FEELING GUILTY.

29:38.533 --> 29:40.133
YEAH...

29:40.167 --> 29:42.800
I'M GONNA TELL MY HUSBAND.

29:44.333 --> 29:46.700
I THINK THE TRUTH
JUST HAS TO COME OUT,

29:46.733 --> 29:49.633
YOU KNOW?

30:00.100 --> 30:03.133
(clears throat)

30:06.833 --> 30:09.200
(clears throat)

30:11.233 --> 30:13.133
DR. BURKE, I KNOW
IT'S A LOT TO ASK,

30:13.167 --> 30:14.700
BUT I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE

30:14.733 --> 30:17.167
IF YOU'D LET ME TRY
MY RUNNING WHIP STITCH.

30:22.667 --> 30:26.300
ALL RIGHT, TAKE A GOOD BITE.

30:26.333 --> 30:29.233
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE
IT HOLDS. GOOD.

30:29.267 --> 30:32.133
DON'T PUT TOO MUCH PRESSURE.

30:32.167 --> 30:34.233
THERE.

30:34.267 --> 30:36.767
KEEP GOING.

30:39.367 --> 30:40.667
OH, MY GOD.

30:40.700 --> 30:42.600
CRISTINA'S DOING
A RUNNING WHIP STITCH

30:42.633 --> 30:44.400
ON A HEART.

30:44.433 --> 30:46.333
I GUESS SLEEPING WITH
YOUR BOSS HAS ITS PERKS.

30:46.367 --> 30:48.233
THIS SUCKS.

30:48.267 --> 30:49.567
CRISTINA GETS SEX AND PERKS.

30:49.600 --> 30:52.433
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST
APOLOGIZE AGAIN, GEORGE.

30:52.467 --> 30:54.767
YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU'RE IN
A GREAT POSITION

30:54.800 --> 30:56.700
TO GIVE RELATIONSHIP ADVICE.

30:56.733 --> 30:59.567
CRISTINA'S DOING
A RUNNING WHIP STITCH

30:59.600 --> 31:01.800
ON A HEART.

31:05.267 --> 31:06.633
(door closes)

31:06.667 --> 31:08.433
I DON'T FEEL LIKE TALKING.

31:10.300 --> 31:12.333
(sighs)

31:12.367 --> 31:15.100
WHEN I'M DRIVING HOME
AT NIGHT

31:15.133 --> 31:17.400
AFTER A LONG DAY AT WORK,

31:17.433 --> 31:20.800
ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
IS GETTING TO MY BABY.

31:20.833 --> 31:22.500
(clicks tongue)

31:22.533 --> 31:25.400
IF THIS IS WHERE YOU TELL ME
TO FIGHT THE CANCER

31:25.433 --> 31:27.567
SO I DON'T MISS OUT
ON THE JOYS OF MOTHERHOOD--

31:27.600 --> 31:30.400
THEN I GET HOME--
THE BABY'S CRYING...

31:30.433 --> 31:32.400
THE EXHAUSTION HITS,

31:32.433 --> 31:38.300
AND I RESENT THAT TINY BABY'S
PRESENCE IN MY HOUSE,

31:38.333 --> 31:42.067
MY PREVIOUSLY
VERY QUIET HOUSE.

31:42.067 --> 31:44.533
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?

31:44.567 --> 31:46.467
SO YOU KNOW WHAT I DO?
(chuckles)

31:46.500 --> 31:49.633
FIRST, I PICK A FIGHT
WITH MY HUSBAND,

31:49.667 --> 31:53.367
YOU KNOW, BLAME HIM FOR NOT
SETTLING THE BABY DOWN,

31:53.400 --> 31:57.167
THEN I BITCH ABOUT
THE NEIGHBORS' LOUD MUSIC.

31:57.200 --> 32:02.500
AND IF I'M REALLY TIRED
AND PISSED OFF...

32:02.533 --> 32:05.300
I BLAME THE BABY.

32:07.133 --> 32:10.067
I MEAN, IF YOU HADN'T
BEEN BREAST-FEEDING,

32:10.100 --> 32:11.833
YOU NEVER WOULD'VE THOUGHT
THE LUMP

32:11.867 --> 32:14.133
WAS A CLOGGED MILK DUCT.

32:14.167 --> 32:16.833
YOU WOULD'VE GONE
TO THE DOCTOR

32:16.867 --> 32:18.767
AS SOON AS YOU FELT IT,

32:18.800 --> 32:21.433
THE CANCER WOULDN'T
HAVE GOTTEN THIS FAR,

32:21.467 --> 32:24.767
AND YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE
MAKING THIS DECISION.

32:26.200 --> 32:28.433
AM I CLOSE?

32:30.400 --> 32:34.667
WHAT KIND OF MOTHER BLAMES
HER OWN BABY FOR HER CANCER?

32:34.700 --> 32:37.367
A MOTHER WHO'S HUMAN.

32:37.400 --> 32:41.400
A MOTHER WHO'S OVERWHELMED.

32:43.300 --> 32:45.200
BUT IF THIS IS GONNA
KILL ME EVENTUALLY,

32:45.233 --> 32:46.533
WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER

32:46.567 --> 32:48.533
IF IT HAPPENED
WHEN GUS WAS LITTLE?

32:48.567 --> 32:51.433
WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER FOR HIM
IF I JUST NEVER EXISTED?

32:51.467 --> 32:52.800
OKAY. SHH.

32:52.833 --> 32:56.800
NOW THIS IS THE PART
WHEN I TELL YOU

32:56.833 --> 32:58.733
TO FIGHT THE CANCER

32:58.767 --> 33:02.767
SO THAT YOU DON'T MISS OUT
ON THE JOYS OF MOTHERHOOD.

33:02.800 --> 33:04.800
(sobbing)

33:04.833 --> 33:05.767
DEREK.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.733
YEAH. HEY, YOU KNOW
WHAT I LIKE?

33:07.767 --> 33:09.367
I LIKE THAT WE'RE CIVILIZED.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.300
WE'RE THESE ADULT,
GROWN-UP PEOPLE WHO CAN BE

33:11.333 --> 33:12.533
DIVORCED AND FRIENDLY.

33:12.567 --> 33:14.267
WE DESERVE A MEDAL.

33:14.300 --> 33:16.133
IT WASN'T A ONE-NIGHT STAND.

33:16.167 --> 33:17.433
WHAT?
MARK AND I--

33:17.467 --> 33:19.833
IT WASN'T A ONE-NIGHT STAND.
I WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM.

33:19.867 --> 33:22.200
OR... AT LEAST,
I THOUGHT I WAS.

33:22.233 --> 33:23.767
AFTER YOU LEFT,

33:23.800 --> 33:25.733
WE LIVED TOGETHER
FOR TWO MONTHS.

33:25.767 --> 33:27.667
I WANTED TO BELIEVE
THAT WE COULD MAKE IT WORK,

33:27.700 --> 33:29.600
THAT I HADN'T THROWN
MY MARRIAGE AWAY,

33:29.633 --> 33:31.533
THAT I HADN'T
THROWN MY LIFE AWAY

33:31.567 --> 33:33.133
ON A FLING.

33:33.167 --> 33:36.500
BUT HE'S MARK, AND, WELL...

33:36.533 --> 33:40.200
I CAUGHT HIM
WITH SOMEONE ELSE, AND...

33:40.233 --> 33:42.200
AND THEN RICHARD CALLED,
SO...

33:42.233 --> 33:45.233
WE BOTH HAD RELATIONSHIPS
WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

33:45.267 --> 33:47.767
WE'RE BOTH EQUALLY LIABLE
FOR EVERYTHING,

33:47.800 --> 33:51.067
SO PLEASE TAKE THE BROWNSTONE.

33:51.067 --> 33:52.800
ALL I WANT IS SEATTLE.

33:52.833 --> 33:54.533
I WANT SEATTLE,

33:54.567 --> 33:58.133
AND I WANT NEVER
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

33:58.167 --> 34:01.167
***

34:03.467 --> 34:05.300
(elevator bell dings)

34:07.733 --> 34:10.733
***

34:18.767 --> 34:21.267
YOU'RE HERE.

34:21.300 --> 34:23.133
YOU'RE EVERYWHERE,

34:23.167 --> 34:25.500
AND I CAN'T NOT TELL YOU.

34:25.533 --> 34:28.300
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN...

34:28.333 --> 34:29.700
NOT TELLING YOU ALL DAY

34:29.733 --> 34:31.633
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS KIND,

34:31.667 --> 34:34.633
AND I THOUGHT I WAS
GIVING YOU SPACE.

34:34.667 --> 34:37.100
BUT I CAN'T NOT TELL YOU
BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE

34:37.133 --> 34:40.300
AND YOU'RE YOU AND...

34:40.333 --> 34:44.667
I BROKE UP WITH FINN.

34:44.700 --> 34:46.600
OKAY.

34:46.633 --> 34:49.633
***

34:51.167 --> 34:56.700
OKAY... THEN.

34:56.733 --> 34:58.300
OKAY.

35:00.500 --> 35:01.833
I TOLD YOU.

35:01.867 --> 35:03.400
(elevator bell dings)

35:03.433 --> 35:05.233
YEAH.

35:05.267 --> 35:08.267
***

35:14.200 --> 35:16.167
THE OPERATION WAS SUCCESSFUL.

35:16.200 --> 35:19.100
THE NEXT 24 TO 48 HOURS
ARE REALLY CRITICAL, BUT--

35:19.133 --> 35:21.067
WE EXPECT YOUR FATHER TO MAKE
A FULL RECOVERY.

35:21.067 --> 35:23.633
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
DR. BURKE.

35:23.667 --> 35:26.533
FIRST DO NO HARM--

35:26.567 --> 35:28.500
EASIER SAID THAN DONE.

35:28.533 --> 35:32.267
WE CAN TAKE ALL THE OATHS
IN THE WORLD,

35:32.300 --> 35:34.533
BUT THE FACT IS...

35:34.567 --> 35:39.300
MOST OF US
DO HARM ALL THE TIME.

35:41.100 --> 35:42.767
I HAVE $8 MILLION.

35:42.800 --> 35:45.100
SO I'VE HEARD.

35:47.467 --> 35:50.400
I CAN...
DO ANYTHING I WANT.

35:50.433 --> 35:51.800
JUST ABOUT.

35:51.833 --> 35:53.533
(exhales)

35:53.567 --> 35:57.067
AND ALL I REALLY WANT TO DO
IS A RUNNING WHIP STITCH.

35:58.567 --> 36:00.467
MY FIRST YEAR AS AN INTERN,

36:00.500 --> 36:03.833
I HAD A STABLE CARDIAC PATIENT
WHO BLEW OUT HIS LUNG

36:03.867 --> 36:06.300
WHILE I WAS
TRANSPORTING HIM TO C.T.

36:06.333 --> 36:08.067
I CALLED IN THE CODE.

36:08.100 --> 36:11.633
BY THE TIME EVERYONE
GOT THERE, HE WAS DEAD.

36:11.667 --> 36:15.233
IF I HAD PUT A CHEST TUBE IN
RIGHT AWAY...

36:15.267 --> 36:17.067
YOU MADE A MISTAKE.

36:18.467 --> 36:20.467
BUT I STAYED.

36:20.500 --> 36:22.800
I WORKED.

36:22.833 --> 36:25.767
I LEARNED.

36:25.800 --> 36:29.167
I NEVER MADE
THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.

36:29.200 --> 36:30.733
IF I HAD QUIT,

36:30.767 --> 36:34.133
ALL I WOULD HAVE HAD
WAS THAT LIFE...

36:34.167 --> 36:37.633
THAT I LOST.

36:37.667 --> 36:40.600
INSTEAD, I GET TO SAVE LIVES.

36:40.633 --> 36:45.233
EVERY DAY,
I GET TO SAVE LIVES.

36:45.267 --> 36:47.300
SOMETIMES EVEN WHEN WE'RE
TRYING TO HELP...

36:47.333 --> 36:50.100
WE DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD...

36:57.067 --> 36:58.733
SHE TOLD YOU.

37:02.633 --> 37:04.533
I'VE KNOWN YOU MY WHOLE LIFE.

37:04.567 --> 37:07.800
I GREW UP WITH YOU, SO I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING...

37:09.367 --> 37:12.767
THAT THERE IS A YEAR
OF YOUR LIFE WASTED

37:12.800 --> 37:14.767
TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK
WITH ADDISON,

37:14.800 --> 37:17.067
AND YOU COULD'VE BEEN
WITH MEREDITH,

37:17.100 --> 37:19.767
THAT YOU COULD BE HAPPY
RIGHT NOW,

37:19.800 --> 37:21.833
THAT ALL THIS...

37:21.867 --> 37:25.433
EVERYTHING...

37:25.467 --> 37:31.433
THAT YOU AND MEREDITH
COULD'VE HAD A REAL CHANCE.

37:31.467 --> 37:33.533
STILL...

37:36.367 --> 37:39.100
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW
THE TRUTH.

37:39.133 --> 37:41.833
I THOUGHT I OWED YOU THAT...

37:41.867 --> 37:43.100
AS A FRIEND.

37:43.133 --> 37:45.233
YOU'RE NOT MY FRIEND.

37:45.267 --> 37:50.633
AND THEN GUILT REARS
ITS UGLY HEAD.

37:50.667 --> 37:54.667
WHAT YOU DO WITH THAT GUILT
IS UP TO YOU.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.367
BABYSITTING, DR. BAILEY?

37:59.400 --> 38:03.067
THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M BABYSITTING.

38:03.100 --> 38:07.600
I'M BEING ALL UNPROFESSIONAL
AND EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED

38:07.633 --> 38:10.700
WHILE MY PATIENT AND HER HUSBAND
ARE HAVING A MOMENT TOGETHER.

38:11.733 --> 38:13.633
OH, YOU MIGHT
WANT TO LEAVE NOW.

38:13.667 --> 38:16.333
I'M FEELING A RUSH
OF HORMONES COMING ON.

38:16.367 --> 38:19.667
THERE'S NO TELLING
WHAT I MIGHT DO.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.367
SILLY, SILLY, SILLY.

38:23.400 --> 38:25.233
HOW'S IT GOING IN THERE?

38:25.267 --> 38:27.233
I THINK THEY'RE LEANING
TOWARDS A MASTECTOMY.

38:27.267 --> 38:28.800
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

38:28.833 --> 38:32.800
UH, ABOUT IZZIE...

38:32.833 --> 38:34.200
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

38:34.233 --> 38:36.133
I KNOW, KAREV.
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

38:36.167 --> 38:37.700
YOU WEREN'T EVEN HERE.

38:37.733 --> 38:39.067
NO, LISTEN... (sighs)

38:39.067 --> 38:40.567
I KNEW.

38:40.600 --> 38:43.333
IZZIE TOLD ME
WHAT SHE WAS GONNA DO,

38:43.367 --> 38:45.500
BUT I DIDN'T WANT
TO GET INVOLVED.

38:45.533 --> 38:48.433
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. I DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING TO STOP HER.

38:48.467 --> 38:51.167
YOU WEREN'T THE ONLY ONE.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.433
ALEX.

38:54.067 --> 38:56.200
THANK YOU.

38:57.867 --> 39:05.400
WE'RE LEFT WITH A CHOICE...

39:05.433 --> 39:06.500
(sighs)

39:06.533 --> 39:10.067
I GOT FRIED CHICKEN--
EXTRA CRISPY--

39:10.100 --> 39:12.400
COLESLAW, PEACH COBBLER,

39:12.433 --> 39:15.833
"BEETLE JUMP" AND...

39:15.867 --> 39:17.767
***

39:17.800 --> 39:20.267
"SAMURAI AMBUSH."

39:20.300 --> 39:22.067
THE OTHER NIGHT...

39:22.100 --> 39:24.600
WHEN I TOLD YOU I WAS DONE
TRYING TO COMPETE?

39:24.633 --> 39:26.533
THAT WAS ME BREAKING UP
WITH YOU.

39:26.567 --> 39:29.233
NO.

39:29.267 --> 39:31.467
NO, I THINK I WOULD'VE
NOTICED THAT.

39:31.500 --> 39:34.167
EXCEPT YOU DIDN'T...

39:34.200 --> 39:37.167
WHICH IS WHY I BROKE UP
WITH YOU.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.133
***

39:39.167 --> 39:43.567
AT LEAST NOW YOU DON'T
HAVE TO FEEL GUILTY ANYMORE.

39:43.600 --> 39:45.500
SHUT UP.

39:45.533 --> 39:48.400
EITHER LET THE GUILT THROW YOU
BACK INTO THE BEHAVIOR

39:48.433 --> 39:53.433
THAT GOT YOU INTO TROUBLE
IN THE FIRST PLACE

39:53.467 --> 39:57.367
OR... LEARN FROM THE GUILT

39:57.400 --> 40:01.400
AND DO YOUR BEST
TO MOVE ON.

40:01.433 --> 40:03.100
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY

40:03.133 --> 40:05.667
NOT GOING TO DEPOSIT
THAT CHECK?

40:05.700 --> 40:08.167
***

40:08.200 --> 40:10.200
SOME GOOD NEEDS TO COME
FROM THIS MONEY.

40:10.233 --> 40:13.067
AND UNTIL I KNOW
WHAT THAT GOOD IS,

40:13.100 --> 40:15.500
NO, I'M NOT DEPOSITING
THE CHECK.

40:15.533 --> 40:18.533
***
