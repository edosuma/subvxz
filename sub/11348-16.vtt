WEBVTT

00:06.640 --> 00:09.677
(narrator) In the criminal
justice system,

00:09.710 --> 00:12.213
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:12.246 --> 00:14.615
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.648 --> 00:16.450
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.484 --> 00:18.219
are members of an elite squad
known as

00:18.252 --> 00:19.953
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.987 --> 00:21.789
These are their stories.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.958
Sorry, watch those blocks.

00:24.992 --> 00:27.328
So what, that toy box
is just what, decorative?

00:27.361 --> 00:29.663
Oh, you brought the jokes.

00:29.697 --> 00:30.664
Listen, would you hold him
for a minute?

00:30.698 --> 00:32.633
Huh?
Ah, oh.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.835
Thanks.

00:34.868 --> 00:39.173
So you said you didn't want to
talk about this in the office?

00:39.207 --> 00:43.911
Um, Johnny D, the pimp,
he's still in custody

00:43.944 --> 00:45.679
on federal charges?

00:45.713 --> 00:48.649
Yeah, his lawyers tried for bail
but they were shut down, why?

00:48.682 --> 00:51.885
What if our investigation
turned up information

00:51.919 --> 00:55.889
that Johnny D fathered a child?

00:55.923 --> 00:59.693
With Elly Porter.

00:59.727 --> 01:02.130
This conversation is
hypothetical as of now, okay?

01:07.168 --> 01:12.273
If Johnny D was in fact
Noah's biological father...

01:14.342 --> 01:17.511
is that something that NYPD
would have to disclose?

01:17.545 --> 01:19.847
You double checked?

01:19.880 --> 01:23.417
Ran the DNA three times.

01:23.451 --> 01:25.786
Johnny D was a major trafficker.

01:25.819 --> 01:29.357
Probably bought and sold
every girl who's been

01:29.390 --> 01:31.692
put to work in New York.

01:31.725 --> 01:35.196
And then he raped them
to break them in.

01:35.229 --> 01:40.168
Look, I haven't slept
since I...

01:40.168 --> 01:42.670
Just tell me that he doesn't
have to know.

01:42.703 --> 01:44.772
He doesn't.

01:44.805 --> 01:48.476
It's not exculpatory in any way.
He never needs to find out.

01:48.509 --> 01:52.346
I've already started
the adoption paperwork.

01:52.380 --> 01:56.217
Given Noah's early history,
how can you be expected

01:56.250 --> 01:58.786
to know who his father was?

02:09.197 --> 02:13.066
Walter?
Excuse me.

02:13.100 --> 02:17.538
They dig you out of the old
novelist's home for this too?

02:19.473 --> 02:20.908
It's Fred Worth, Walter.

02:20.941 --> 02:23.377
Fred Worth.
Wow, great to see you.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.213
Are you sure?

02:25.246 --> 02:30.117
Last time we spoke was in the
green room at the Cavett show.

02:30.218 --> 02:33.587
I had just finished
reviewing your Vietnam book.

02:33.621 --> 02:36.123
You said you were gonna
slice off my ears

02:36.224 --> 02:37.958
and mail them to the Viet Cong.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.760
I didn't do it.
Did I?

02:39.793 --> 02:41.562
Of course not, darling.

02:41.595 --> 02:44.232
I guess you're going strong,
Walter.

02:44.232 --> 02:47.501
Forgot what it takes to hold
onto a beauty like this.

02:47.535 --> 02:50.103
My prettiest wife yet.

02:50.137 --> 02:52.640
Oh, look, there's Roland Evans.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.942
Ah.
Fred, great to see you.

02:54.975 --> 02:58.346
Great to see you too.

03:04.252 --> 03:05.986
- Dad!
- Dad?

03:06.019 --> 03:08.356
We weren't on the list
for the party because of her.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.390
- Charmaine?
- Yeah, Dad.

03:09.423 --> 03:10.824
She won't let us see you.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.660
Delilah, please not now.
Your father is cold.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.862
We've been to the house.
She hasn't let us in to see you.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.097
Dad--Dad, we just want to know
are you all right?

03:17.130 --> 03:18.432
- We miss you.
- Yeah, I--I'm great.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.000
I'm just fine, yes.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.402
Dad, are you sure?

03:21.435 --> 03:23.571
- I'm fine.
- Watch your head.

03:23.604 --> 03:24.905
Dad?

03:24.938 --> 03:26.574
It was great to see you.

03:36.284 --> 03:37.751
[knock at door]

03:37.785 --> 03:39.287
Hey, Sarge, there's two women

03:39.287 --> 03:41.389
here who will only speak
to someone in charge.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.791
Sure.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.693
Hi, how can I help you?

03:45.726 --> 03:47.895
We want to report
a sex crime--a rape.

03:47.928 --> 03:51.965
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Why don't you have a seat?

03:51.999 --> 03:54.535
- Which one of you--
- It wasn't one of us.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.305
It was our father,
Walter Briggs.

03:57.305 --> 04:00.107
The novelist?
I'm a huge admirer.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.809
I've read every one
of his books ever since--

04:01.842 --> 04:04.312
So what happened to him?

04:04.312 --> 04:05.846
His wife, Charmaine,

04:05.879 --> 04:08.148
she pumps him full
of erectile dysfunction pills

04:08.181 --> 04:10.951
and makes him have sex
every day, which is dangerous,

04:10.984 --> 04:12.686
considering
he's got a heart condition.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.389
He's divorced
from both our mothers.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.157
Charmaine won't let us see him.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.826
So how do you know this?

04:18.859 --> 04:20.728
His housekeeper told us.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.831
She feels terrible,
but she doesn't know what to do.

04:23.864 --> 04:26.334
That may not technically
be rape.

04:26.334 --> 04:30.571
Penal law section 130.25--
sexual intercourse with a person

04:30.604 --> 04:33.407
who is incapable of consent
because of mental disability

04:33.441 --> 04:35.242
or incapacitation.

04:35.343 --> 04:38.579
Our father is almost 80
and has dementia.

04:38.612 --> 04:39.647
He does not consent.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.715
He cannot consent.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.050
Did you look that up?

04:43.083 --> 04:44.485
- I'm in law school.
- Oh, where?

04:44.518 --> 04:48.856
- I'm in Fordham--nights.
- Carisi?

04:48.889 --> 04:51.224
Why would she be doing this?

04:51.258 --> 04:53.827
Our father's will divides
his estate in equal shares

04:53.861 --> 04:56.530
between his current wife
and his children.

04:56.564 --> 05:00.468
Your stepmother wants a child
so she can have an extra share.

05:00.501 --> 05:03.136
So she's raping him.

05:10.444 --> 05:13.414
[dramatic music]

05:13.447 --> 05:21.422
*

05:58.025 --> 05:58.225
.

05:58.258 --> 06:01.429
Yes, I've worked
for Mr. Walter for 30 years.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.196
His daughters told us
that you had some concerns.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.998
I do.

06:05.032 --> 06:08.469
When Mrs. Briggs find out,
she'd fire me in a skip second.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.170
No--we'll do our best
to keep you out of it.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.973
What's she's doing
to Mr. Walter is wrong.

06:13.006 --> 06:14.642
Giving him them pills.

06:14.675 --> 06:18.145
He doesn't know, but I see her.

06:18.178 --> 06:21.915
A man his age--
he needs his ease.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.685
Does he know what's going on?
In general.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.987
He was brilliant.

06:27.020 --> 06:32.826
Now he's got gaps.
Big, empty spaces.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.562
Oh, she don't like me
to be late.

06:34.595 --> 06:37.230
Okay.
Thank you coming in.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.335
Well, the housekeeper confirms.

06:42.369 --> 06:44.538
Okay, so Mr. Walter
as in Walter Briggs, the writer?

06:44.572 --> 06:46.206
Yeah, Pulitzer Prize,
National Book Award.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.941
Well, he's nearly 80,
and his wife--

06:47.975 --> 06:50.110
- His sixth wife.
- Who's 45--

06:50.143 --> 06:51.612
And making him
have sex constantly.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.614
Is that a crime
or an old man's dream?

06:53.647 --> 06:56.249
The daughters say
that she wants another child,

06:56.283 --> 06:58.852
so if he is incapable
of giving consent,

06:58.886 --> 07:00.287
then they're right,
it's--it's rape.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.189
Yeah, and the fact
that the alleged rapist

07:02.222 --> 07:03.657
is his wife
is legally irrelevant

07:03.691 --> 07:06.660
but, I mean,
of all the people--I mean,

07:06.694 --> 07:08.962
have you guys read Briggs' book
The Fifth Assailant?

07:08.996 --> 07:10.664
The guy is a literary genius.

07:10.698 --> 07:12.800
Isn't he the literary genius
who threw one of his wives

07:12.833 --> 07:14.968
through a plate glass window?

07:15.002 --> 07:18.338
Yeah, there's actually a scene
based on that in the book.

07:18.371 --> 07:20.708
Okay, so the complaints
are coming from his daughters,

07:20.741 --> 07:21.809
right?

07:21.842 --> 07:22.976
What's in it for them?

07:23.010 --> 07:24.878
A bigger slice of the estate?

07:24.912 --> 07:27.347
No--love, devotion,
maybe concern?

07:27.380 --> 07:28.882
Right.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.651
We've got an allegation,
we have corroborations,

07:30.684 --> 07:34.154
so you two go speak
with the happy couple.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.222
And Carisi,

07:35.255 --> 07:38.792
as a detective, not a fan.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.298
I should say I'm still
not quite sure why you're here.

07:45.332 --> 07:46.867
It's called a welfare check.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.002
We do it from time to time,
mostly with seniors.

07:49.036 --> 07:52.072
I'm guessing
that would be me, huh?

07:52.105 --> 07:54.207
Oh, dear, did my husband's
daughters call you?

07:54.241 --> 07:55.909
They did express some concern.

07:55.943 --> 07:58.311
They said they weren't allowed
to see Mr. Briggs?

07:58.345 --> 08:00.581
This is one of those difficult
family situations--

08:00.614 --> 08:02.249
stepmother, stepdaughters.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.951
I'm sure
it happens all the time.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.787
I'm sure it does but actually,
Mrs. Briggs,

08:06.820 --> 08:09.256
would you mind if we--
if we spoke separately?

08:09.289 --> 08:10.758
It's just standard procedure.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.593
As a matter of fact,
I do mind.

08:12.626 --> 08:16.096
Walter and I don't keep secrets
from each other, do we, Walter?

08:16.129 --> 08:20.333
Not really, no.
I humor her.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.335
So what exactly
did you want to talk about?

08:22.369 --> 08:24.137
It's pretty personal.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.807
Pertaining to your sex life.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.576
And that's a police matter?

08:28.576 --> 08:32.112
79 and stiff
as a varnished eel.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.981
A varnished eel.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.783
My third wife
took up with a bartender

08:35.816 --> 08:39.419
because I got distracted
by my book on the pope.

08:39.452 --> 08:41.421
Now, you spend six months
in the Vatican,

08:41.454 --> 08:45.959
and you'll see
what happens to your testicles.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.928
Roman Follies.
It was a wonderful book, sir.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.597
- I read it in college.
- Thank you.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.798
All of his books
are wonderful.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.299
Okay, so Mr. Briggs,

08:52.332 --> 08:53.867
you're happy to keep
your wife satisfied?

08:53.901 --> 08:56.169
Well, of course I am.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.205
I mean, just look at her.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.307
Moreover, I'm obliged.

09:00.340 --> 09:04.077
It's a man's duty to nature.

09:04.111 --> 09:07.180
(Walter)
A million years of evolution,
you know.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.249
Oh, these feminists,
they can preach

09:09.282 --> 09:11.251
and screech all they want,

09:11.284 --> 09:14.354
but until the day
that a man suckles an infant

09:14.387 --> 09:19.359
and a woman goes out
and hunts, and...

09:25.332 --> 09:28.468
A woman goes out
and hunts, and...

09:28.501 --> 09:30.070
What?
I'm sorry.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.272
What?
I'm sorry.

09:32.305 --> 09:36.543
My husband's very tired,
but as you can see, we are fine.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.446
You're kidding me.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.214
His daughters are complaining,
but he isn't?

09:41.248 --> 09:43.050
Yeah, he says
he's doing his manly duty

09:43.083 --> 09:44.818
by keeping his woman satisfied.

09:44.852 --> 09:47.821
So he's consenting
to the sexual activity?

09:47.855 --> 09:50.390
Him and his varnished eel.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.392
Okay, but is he capable
of consent?

09:52.425 --> 09:54.728
I mean, what's he like?

09:54.762 --> 09:56.429
- I don't know.
- Rollins?

09:56.463 --> 09:57.831
He winked at Rollins
a whole bunch.

09:57.865 --> 09:59.432
He quoted from an essay
about manly men

09:59.466 --> 10:01.168
that he wrote in Playboy
in 1972,

10:01.201 --> 10:04.337
and then just like that,
he goes off into ga-ga land.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.940
It was sad.
The guy was a titan.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.575
Listen,
that was the housekeeper.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.911
Mr. Briggs just
went to the hospital.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.681
Apparent heart attack.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.983
The daughter said
that he had a heart condition.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.584
If the wife knew

10:17.617 --> 10:19.119
and was secretly
feeding him those pills--

10:19.152 --> 10:20.821
Yeah, that's assault three.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.956
Recklessly causing physical
injury to another person,

10:22.990 --> 10:25.092
maybe even attempted murder.
Am I right, counselor?

10:25.125 --> 10:27.194
Seldom. Unless the daughters
can give you proof

10:27.227 --> 10:28.696
that the wife knew about
the heart condition

10:28.729 --> 10:31.665
and was exacerbating it,
you've got nothing.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.669
She's contesting it?
Of course she is.

10:35.703 --> 10:39.639
What a bitch.
Okay, call me back.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.141
That was my sister.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.475
She's been at the courthouse
all day

10:42.509 --> 10:44.945
trying to get visitation rights.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.680
Charmaine still won't let
us visit him,

10:46.714 --> 10:48.982
not even in the hospital.

10:49.016 --> 10:52.953
- Any word on his condition?
- Stable. That's all we know.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.454
Has he had heart attacks
before?

10:54.487 --> 10:57.324
Several, going back
to the '80s.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.892
But can you prove
Charmaine knew that?

10:58.926 --> 11:00.728
The world knew it.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.030
He wrote a piece about his first
heart attack for Esquire.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.965
[cell phone vibrates]

11:04.998 --> 11:06.734
Of course I have 12 crazies
here today.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.201
I'm a playwright.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.470
I started this theater
to put up my own work,

11:10.503 --> 11:12.039
so now I'm artistic director,

11:12.072 --> 11:14.541
fundraiser, ticket taker,
occasional janitor.

11:14.574 --> 11:16.376
Let me be clear.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.445
Did you and your sister
ever specifically

11:18.478 --> 11:21.581
discuss your father's heart
condition with Charmaine?

11:21.614 --> 11:23.650
Absolutely.

11:26.754 --> 11:27.921
(Benson)
Dr. Tedroe?

11:27.955 --> 11:29.589
Are you here
because of the incident?

11:29.622 --> 11:32.625
Yes, we're wondering
if Mr. Briggs' heart attack

11:32.659 --> 11:34.895
could have been caused
by his ED medication.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.429
I don't know.
I never got the chance

11:36.463 --> 11:38.631
to take a complete medical
history.

11:38.665 --> 11:40.000
Why not?

11:40.033 --> 11:43.103
I thought that's
why you're here.

11:43.136 --> 11:47.174
His wife arrived 20 minutes ago
with a private ambulance

11:47.207 --> 11:51.779
and removed him from the
hospital against medical advice.

11:51.779 --> 11:54.948
She pulled him off the EKG
monitor and was in such a hurry,

11:54.982 --> 11:56.316
she took our IV pump with her.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.785
The nurses didn't try
to stop her

11:57.785 --> 11:59.286
because Mr. Briggs
needed it to maintain.

11:59.319 --> 12:01.588
Can he maintain
outside the hospital?

12:01.621 --> 12:02.990
Maybe, maybe not.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.424
His wife has put his life
in jeopardy.

12:04.457 --> 12:05.793
And you just let her take him?

12:05.793 --> 12:07.194
His wife said
she was transferring him

12:07.227 --> 12:08.528
to another hospital.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.564
We got the court order.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.266
Where's our dad?

12:13.300 --> 12:16.169
- He's not here.
- You mean he's...gone?

12:16.203 --> 12:20.673
No, no, no, no.
No, he was--more like taken.

12:28.448 --> 12:28.648
.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.951
We have checked
every hospital in Manhattan.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.319
There is no sign of Briggs.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.821
It's not kidnapping.
She's his wife.

12:33.821 --> 12:34.822
She has the right to take him
out of the hospital.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.156
Even against medical advice?

12:36.189 --> 12:37.590
Ripping hospital equipment
out of the wall?

12:37.624 --> 12:39.492
Want me to file a larceny
charge on the IV pump?

12:39.526 --> 12:41.094
His daughter's got
a court order to visit him.

12:41.128 --> 12:42.162
Charmaine's in violation.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.630
Has she denied them access?

12:43.663 --> 12:45.465
- They don't know where he is.
- So no.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.600
She's endangering
her husband's life.

12:47.634 --> 12:49.269
The--the doctors made
that clear.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.437
Yeah, plus the rape
and assault charges

12:50.470 --> 12:52.172
are still under investigation.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.941
Barely--one of them's a stretch,
the other one's a chasm.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.843
This is a sick old man
getting dragged across the city.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.244
Well, we're not social workers.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.080
But we are cops,
and we can keep investigating.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.850
- Knock yourselves out.
- We will.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.590
Mommy?
Yeah, it's me.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.993
No, how's Abuelita doing?

13:13.026 --> 13:16.763
Uh-huh, I can stop by the house
probably tonight.

13:16.864 --> 13:18.531
They sent her home?

13:18.565 --> 13:19.900
Who's gonna take care of her?

13:23.937 --> 13:25.672
The dispatcher said
you handled a call today

13:25.705 --> 13:27.875
concerning a patient
named Briggs.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.877
The sick old dude
with the crazy wife?

13:29.877 --> 13:31.111
You tell me.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.046
Guy had tubes
hanging out of his arms.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.781
I could barely get him
in the chair.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.449
I figured we were going
to another hospital,

13:36.483 --> 13:38.886
maybe rehab,
but the wife said no.

13:38.886 --> 13:40.053
Where'd she want to go?

13:40.087 --> 13:42.355
Private airport
in Westchester.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.624
I said, "Lady, I don't think
your husband's up for a flight."

13:44.657 --> 13:46.093
She said she was paying me
to drive,

13:46.126 --> 13:47.394
not give medical opinions.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.396
- Okay, so you took him.
- No way.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.064
I told her we were going back
to the hospital

13:51.098 --> 13:53.066
or to another hospital--
end of options.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.801
That guy kicks on a plane
somewhere,

13:54.902 --> 13:55.903
they're gonna ask about
the brilliant ambulance driver

13:55.936 --> 13:57.270
who launched him.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.705
So where'd you end up
taking him?

13:58.738 --> 14:00.440
The lady made me
stop right there.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.109
She dragged her husband
out in the middle

14:02.142 --> 14:03.911
of 57th Street.
Hailed a cab.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.645
Wow, okay.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.915
Did she mention where they were
gonna go on that private plane?

14:07.915 --> 14:09.316
Canada.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.918
That sound like a healthy choice
for a sick old man

14:10.918 --> 14:12.920
in the winter?

14:12.920 --> 14:14.687
Hmm.

14:14.721 --> 14:20.360
[police sirens whooping]

14:23.096 --> 14:25.966
Mr. Briggs.
Mrs. Briggs?

14:25.999 --> 14:28.135
Hello, detectives.

14:28.168 --> 14:31.538
- Oh, great to see you.
- Good to see you too, sir.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.640
Mrs. Briggs, you want to tell us
what's going on?

14:33.673 --> 14:35.575
We are taking a vacation.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.978
Is that right, Mr. Briggs?

14:38.011 --> 14:40.813
I humor her.

14:40.847 --> 14:44.084
Mr. Briggs, your daughters
got a court order to see you.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.552
They're concerned
about your welfare.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.320
I'm his wife, no one
is more concerned

14:47.354 --> 14:48.555
about his welfare than me.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.257
Well, that may be true,
Mrs. Briggs,

14:50.290 --> 14:52.059
but now you're gonna
have to tell that to a judge.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.227
My lawyer already spent half
the day in front of the judge.

14:54.261 --> 14:57.064
Well, now you're gonna
have to spend all night.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.565
Please.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.306
So you say you're pursuing

15:06.339 --> 15:08.408
a criminal investigation
against Mrs. Briggs?

15:08.441 --> 15:10.110
(Heller)
Which is ridiculous,
Your Honor.

15:10.143 --> 15:11.478
This is police intimidation.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.980
What are they even doing here?

15:13.013 --> 15:14.414
And you are Mrs. Briggs'
attorney?

15:14.447 --> 15:15.782
Arlene Heller, always a pleasure

15:15.815 --> 15:17.784
to come to bucolic Westchester.

15:17.817 --> 15:20.020
How nice.
Mrs. Briggs is not under arrest.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.754
- Is that correct?
- Yes, ma'am.

15:21.788 --> 15:24.024
Then why am I being held
against my will?

15:24.057 --> 15:25.158
Because you were trying
to sneak our father

15:25.192 --> 15:26.426
out of the country.

15:26.459 --> 15:27.760
What sneak?
Mr. and Mrs. Briggs

15:27.794 --> 15:29.529
can take a trip if they want to.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.999
Your Honor, we have a court
order allowing us to see him.

15:32.032 --> 15:35.002
And we are moving now
to be his guardians,

15:35.002 --> 15:38.005
pursuant to article 81
of the Mental Hygiene Law.

15:38.005 --> 15:40.007
Guardians?
He doesn't need guardians.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.474
He's married to me.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.010
Mr. Briggs was removed
from a hospital today

15:43.043 --> 15:45.145
by Mrs. Briggs,
against medical advice.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.114
And evidence suggests
the heart attack

15:47.147 --> 15:49.116
that put him in the hospital
was caused by Mrs. Briggs

15:49.149 --> 15:51.718
overdosing him on erectile
dysfunction medication.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.620
What evidence?
Who's testifying here?

15:53.653 --> 15:56.289
When did NYPD
become medical doctors?

15:56.323 --> 15:58.158
I'll take it from here,
Ms. Heller.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.727
So the contention is Mrs. Briggs
is abusing her husband?

16:00.760 --> 16:02.795
Absolutely.

16:02.829 --> 16:07.100
Mr. Briggs,
is your wife abusing you?

16:07.134 --> 16:10.203
No, of course not.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.604
There is a question,
Your Honor,

16:11.638 --> 16:13.906
of mental competence.

16:13.940 --> 16:17.944
Mr. Briggs, can you tell me
what this hearing is about?

16:18.045 --> 16:19.946
Well, I'm pretty sure
that it's about me.

16:20.047 --> 16:23.383
Dad, you're here because you
should be back in the hospital.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.817
- No, I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

16:24.851 --> 16:26.253
Charmaine is not taking care
of you.

16:26.286 --> 16:27.420
I don't have
to stand for this.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.556
Everyone, stop.
One at a time.

16:29.589 --> 16:34.227
Your Honor?
May I have a minute, please?

16:37.364 --> 16:41.801
You know who I am,
right, Dad?

16:41.834 --> 16:44.671
Yes, I know who you are.
You're my daughter.

16:44.704 --> 16:48.408
And you know who she is,
right?

16:48.441 --> 16:50.077
Yes, another daughter.

16:50.110 --> 16:53.080
Don't you think
I know my children?

16:53.113 --> 16:55.182
What are our names, Dad?

16:56.716 --> 16:59.152
This is ridiculous.
He is exhausted.

16:59.186 --> 17:03.856
Just a moment.
Do you know their names, sir?

17:03.890 --> 17:06.993
Well, I ought to.
I named them myself.

17:07.094 --> 17:09.829
Dad, who am I?

17:09.862 --> 17:11.598
Well, you're the one
that wants to be a writer.

17:11.631 --> 17:15.268
No--oh, no.
She is, right?

17:15.302 --> 17:19.706
That's right, Dad.

17:19.739 --> 17:22.109
What's my name?
Come on, Dad.

17:22.142 --> 17:25.112
You named us after women
in the Bible--strong women.

17:25.145 --> 17:29.549
Judith, that's enough.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.885
There's been so many people.

17:32.919 --> 17:35.122
This proves nothing, Your Honor.
It's late.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.723
Mr. Briggs is recovering
from a heart attack.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.225
Oh, that didn't stop her
from pulling him out

17:38.258 --> 17:39.226
of his hospital bed.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.128
That's enough.

17:41.128 --> 17:42.462
I'm gonna reserve judgment
on the motion for guardianship

17:42.495 --> 17:44.264
pending a psychological
and physical examination

17:44.297 --> 17:45.698
of Mr. Briggs.

17:45.732 --> 17:50.470
I remember.
Their names were from the Bible.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.705
Delilah cut somebody's hair,

17:52.739 --> 17:55.275
and Judith cut off
somebody's head.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.576
Thank you, sir.

17:56.609 --> 17:57.577
In the meantime,
he'll be admitted

17:57.610 --> 17:59.146
to Westchester General

17:59.179 --> 18:03.350
and his daughters
may visit whenever they like.

18:09.489 --> 18:12.659
You are the one
tormenting him, not me.

18:12.692 --> 18:17.029
Walter, I'm gonna get you
the best room in that hospital.

18:19.832 --> 18:22.902
I had six wives, you know.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.504
I know, sir.

18:24.537 --> 18:27.874
And hundreds of lovers.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.509
I penetrated their bodies

18:29.542 --> 18:32.979
and I penetrated their minds,
because I was a man.

18:33.012 --> 18:35.715
That's what I was supposed
to be.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.184
And now,
women are batting me around

18:37.217 --> 18:39.986
like a feathered shuttlecock.

18:40.019 --> 18:45.425
My wife, my daughters,
and a judge in a skirt.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.361
Oh, God.

18:48.395 --> 18:52.265
And tonight, I'm gonna
have a nurse wipe my ass.

18:56.969 --> 19:02.309
How did this happen, hmm?
You tell me.

19:19.859 --> 19:22.795
Mommy, I just don't understand
why she doesn't go to rehab.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.531
'Cause she doesn't want to go
to rehab.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.299
The doctors have
all argued with her.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.601
They are done.
Do you want to argue with her?

19:28.635 --> 19:30.537
Yeah, I do.
Let me carry one of those bags.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.539
Wait, wait--there's eggs
in that one.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.474
Let--don't worry,
I think I can handle it.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.809
So is this the plan?
Huh?

19:36.843 --> 19:40.112
Hi...You're gonna work for
12 hours every day

19:40.146 --> 19:43.149
and then come here and do
her pills, bring her groceries.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.818
I'm her daughter.
And the stairs are hard for her.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.887
Yeah, that's why she should live
in an elevator building.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.122
I don't mind,
and she loves it here.

19:50.156 --> 19:51.724
You can have
the groceries delivered.

19:51.758 --> 19:55.328
[laughs]
This is the Bronx, darling.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.630
This is not Park Avenue,
remember?

19:57.664 --> 19:59.366
How could I forget?

20:00.500 --> 20:04.203
Momma?
It's me.

20:07.006 --> 20:10.510
Ah.
I see you brought el juez.

20:10.543 --> 20:14.347
Abuelita, I'm not a judge.

20:14.381 --> 20:18.251
You will be.

20:18.285 --> 20:20.753
To what do I owe the honor?

20:24.691 --> 20:26.926
Hey, how'd it go last night?

20:26.959 --> 20:28.261
Heartbreaking.

20:28.295 --> 20:29.562
I mean, Briggs is aware
just enough

20:29.596 --> 20:31.163
to know that he's lost it.

20:31.197 --> 20:33.266
Not anymore, he isn't.
That was the hospital.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.568
He died earlier this morning
up in Westchester.

20:35.602 --> 20:38.070
Another heart attack.

20:40.273 --> 20:41.674
Maybe it's for the best.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.075
You know, wife like that--

20:43.109 --> 20:44.611
the end game
was gonna be pretty brutal.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.245
(Benson)
Well, it already was.

20:46.279 --> 20:48.348
Look, we need Warner
or any other New York City ME

20:48.381 --> 20:50.116
to perform the autopsy--

20:50.149 --> 20:52.018
make sure his wife's actions
didn't contribute.

20:52.051 --> 20:54.721
The judge put off
ruling on guardianship.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.923
Charmaine still has control
of everything.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.091
Including the body.
That's not good.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.961
All right, get up there.
I'll call Barba.

21:11.203 --> 21:13.840
Hey, hold up.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.442
Is that Mr. Briggs?

21:15.475 --> 21:17.710
Yes, I'm taking him
to a beautiful place.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.446
Actually, you're not.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.514
It's a court order.
No more hide and seek.

21:21.548 --> 21:23.015
Trip's off, boys.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.352
The world isn't done
with Walter Briggs.

21:31.824 --> 21:32.024
.

21:32.058 --> 21:35.094
His arteries were clogged,
his heart enlarged.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.830
Since when does SVU investigate
death by heart attack?

21:37.864 --> 21:39.432
Well, his wife
took him on a road trip

21:39.466 --> 21:41.133
after he had a smaller attack
yesterday.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.969
We just want to know
if it contributed.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.771
Well, it certainly didn't help.

21:44.804 --> 21:47.073
The gentleman was in
no condition to go sightseeing.

21:47.106 --> 21:49.409
So you would draw a connection
between that and his death?

21:49.442 --> 21:51.243
I mean, doc,
she took him out of the hospital

21:51.277 --> 21:53.580
against medical advice
with an IV hanging from his arm.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.748
Well then, ipso facto.

21:55.782 --> 21:57.016
By the way, it looks
like she pulled something else

21:57.049 --> 21:58.385
out of him too.

21:58.385 --> 22:01.821
- What?
- There's semen in his urethra.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.390
He had sex?

22:03.423 --> 22:06.559
A final ejaculation
shortly before or after he died.

22:06.593 --> 22:09.729
His wife climbed
into the hospital bed with him?

22:09.762 --> 22:12.599
I don't believe he was in
any shape to be that fortunate.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.200
If you care to observe,

22:14.233 --> 22:16.168
I could show you
the intrarectal trauma.

22:16.202 --> 22:17.570
No--no, thanks.
I'm good.

22:17.604 --> 22:22.074
Really?
Rectal probe electroejaculation?

22:22.108 --> 22:23.242
Wow.

22:23.275 --> 22:24.911
Guys, I'm--I'm lost here.

22:24.944 --> 22:27.179
It's a technique
for grieving wives

22:27.213 --> 22:33.119
to procreate with their loved
ones, even posthumously.

22:33.152 --> 22:37.557
Rectal probe
electroejaculation?

22:37.590 --> 22:39.892
That sounds like a sex crime
in and of itself.

22:39.926 --> 22:42.629
We talked to the nurse
on the ward in Westchester.

22:42.662 --> 22:44.230
In the middle of the night
after he died,

22:44.263 --> 22:45.698
his daughters had just left.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.967
His wife called in
a specialized company

22:48.000 --> 22:49.536
to extract his sperm.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.103
They're used
to emergency calls.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.972
The same outfit cuts heads
off bodies for people

22:53.005 --> 22:54.273
who want to freeze them.

22:54.306 --> 22:55.708
The hospital allowed this?

22:55.742 --> 22:58.244
The wife had the right,
as you pointed out.

22:58.277 --> 22:59.579
Come on, counselor.

22:59.612 --> 23:00.947
You know what we're looking
at here.

23:00.980 --> 23:02.982
She tormented this guy,
all right?

23:03.015 --> 23:04.717
The blue pills,
the flight from the hospital--

23:04.751 --> 23:09.722
It pains me to say this,
but you're right, Carisi.

23:09.756 --> 23:11.558
She killed him.

23:14.326 --> 23:15.528
Manslaughter
in the second degree--

23:15.562 --> 23:16.863
does the defendant have a plea?

23:16.896 --> 23:18.565
A plea for sanity, Your Honor.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.166
Mrs. Briggs is a widow

23:20.199 --> 23:23.002
whose husband died tragically
of natural causes.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.704
Natural causes brought on
by the reckless behavior

23:24.737 --> 23:26.005
of the defendant.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.707
Her counsel might want
to read the statute.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.676
The ADA might want to ditch
the condescending attitude

23:29.709 --> 23:31.343
before it drips
onto his suit.

23:31.377 --> 23:33.212
(judge)
You two hash this out
on your own time.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.381
Assuming no objection,
I'll enter a plea of not guilty.

23:35.482 --> 23:37.584
Bail is set at 100,000,
cash or bond.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.085
Next.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.691
- Mommy.
- We have to talk.

23:44.724 --> 23:45.692
Okay, I'm a little busy
right now.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.059
You're always busy.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.360
You don't think
this is important?

23:48.394 --> 23:49.929
Claro que si, of course I do.

23:49.962 --> 23:52.031
Barba--$100,000 for a homicide?
Are you kidding me?

23:52.064 --> 23:53.666
We're lucky
we didn't get our OR.

23:53.700 --> 23:57.236
Sergeant Benson, this
is my mother, Lucille Barba.

23:57.269 --> 23:59.739
- Oh.
- Benson...he talks about you.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.842
You drive him a little crazy.

24:02.875 --> 24:06.178
- Just doing my job.
- Mommy...

24:06.212 --> 24:08.648
Take another look at
that place for Abuelita.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.149
You know that it's
the right thing to do.

24:10.182 --> 24:12.819
No, you know it's
the right thing to do.

24:12.852 --> 24:14.954
Please, just think about it.

24:14.987 --> 24:17.423
I'm thinking.
Call me.

24:17.524 --> 24:18.991
Bye, ma.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.593
- Charmaine?
- Charmaine, Charmaine.

24:20.627 --> 24:22.194
Charmaine, Charmaine--
did you kill your husband?

24:22.228 --> 24:24.263
Charmaine, why did you hide
Walter from the kids?

24:24.296 --> 24:27.266
You people are jackals.
You just want raw meat.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.602
The prosecution is hounding
a loyal,

24:29.636 --> 24:31.203
loving wife who was dealing

24:31.237 --> 24:32.672
with her husband's illness
as best she could.

24:32.705 --> 24:34.874
I just want my husband
to rest in peace.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.876
(male reporter)
How much did you pay
for the rectal probe?

24:36.909 --> 24:39.045
(female reporter)
What did you do
with your husband's sperm?

24:39.078 --> 24:42.649
- Do we have to listen to this?
- They're not bad questions.

24:42.682 --> 24:46.318
- Did you see the headline?
- Yeah.

24:46.352 --> 24:49.288
Everything the guy accomplished,
his whole life reduced to this.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.558
He wasn't exactly
a great human being.

24:51.558 --> 24:55.294
He was a great writer, Nick.
The work deserves respect.

25:00.833 --> 25:03.102
Ms. Thwaites, in your capacity
as the Briggs' housekeeper,

25:03.135 --> 25:06.372
did you have occasion
to see Mrs. Briggs administering

25:06.405 --> 25:07.607
medication to her husband?

25:07.640 --> 25:09.041
(Thwaites)
Yes.

25:09.075 --> 25:11.043
I've seen those pills
on the TV ads,

25:11.077 --> 25:15.748
the ones where--so men can,
you know, perform.

25:15.782 --> 25:17.984
But I knew what
she was giving Mr. Walter,

25:18.017 --> 25:19.952
- but he didn't.
- Strike that.

25:19.986 --> 25:22.321
Your Honor, she's a housekeeper,
not a psychic.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.891
She can't know
what the deceased knew.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.793
Sustained.
Jury will disregard.

25:26.826 --> 25:29.461
How did the defendant
give Mr. Briggs those pills?

25:29.495 --> 25:31.097
Mashed up the pills
and put them

25:31.130 --> 25:33.733
in orange juice
when he wasn't in the room.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.968
(Barba)
Thank you.

25:36.002 --> 25:38.605
And that's exactly what you told
Mrs. Briggs' stepdaughter,

25:38.605 --> 25:41.073
- Delilah, isn't that right?
- I did.

25:41.107 --> 25:42.341
(Heller)
And you've known Delilah
a long time?

25:42.374 --> 25:44.510
I helped raise her.

25:44.611 --> 25:47.647
I was with Mr. Walter
through four marriages.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.617
So you feel motherly
towards Delilah?

25:50.617 --> 25:54.353
I don't know about motherly.
I am fond of her.

25:54.386 --> 25:57.356
Are you fond
of Charmaine Briggs?

25:57.389 --> 25:59.992
No.

26:00.026 --> 26:01.360
(Heller)
Were you upset that

26:01.393 --> 26:03.262
she wouldn't let Delilah
see Mr. Briggs?

26:03.295 --> 26:05.064
It broke my heart.

26:05.097 --> 26:09.368
So you were looking for a way
to get her in to see her father

26:09.401 --> 26:13.906
by feeding Delilah ammunition
against her stepmother?

26:13.940 --> 26:15.842
I didn't think of it
like that.

26:15.875 --> 26:18.210
Well, maybe you didn't.

26:19.979 --> 26:22.214
No further questions.

26:26.452 --> 26:28.420
Mr. Briggs
had a reasonable chance

26:28.454 --> 26:30.089
of surviving
his initial heart attack,

26:30.122 --> 26:32.058
but he was
in very fragile health.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.559
And what would the effect
on such a patient

26:33.660 --> 26:35.862
be of yanking him
out of the hospital,

26:35.895 --> 26:37.930
putting him in an ambulance
and then a taxi,

26:37.964 --> 26:41.901
then leaving him shivering
for hours in an airport hangar?

26:41.934 --> 26:43.936
Potentially catastrophic.

26:43.970 --> 26:46.072
Every one of those acts
puts stress on a patient

26:46.105 --> 26:47.940
who is already very weak.

26:47.974 --> 26:50.710
That's why we urged Mrs. Briggs
to leave her husband with us,

26:50.743 --> 26:52.544
but she refused.

26:52.578 --> 26:54.246
Thank you.

26:54.280 --> 26:57.216
Dr. Tedroe, you said that moving
around town was dangerous

26:57.249 --> 26:59.451
for Mr. Briggs
because his health was so bad.

26:59.485 --> 27:00.887
That's right.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.555
So bad that everyday,
ordinary activity

27:03.589 --> 27:06.793
like getting into a taxi
could lead to his death?

27:06.826 --> 27:08.360
Yes.

27:08.394 --> 27:10.697
So wasn't he in danger
of dying soon anyway?

27:10.697 --> 27:12.832
Couldn't he have died while,
I don't know,

27:12.865 --> 27:16.869
going to the bathroom
while lifting a spoon?

27:16.903 --> 27:18.838
He might have.

27:18.871 --> 27:20.707
I see.
Thank you.

27:21.908 --> 27:25.077
Redirect?

27:25.111 --> 27:28.881
Dr. Tedroe, what was
more dangerous for Mr. Briggs--

27:28.915 --> 27:31.718
lifting a spoon or being dragged
around two counties?

27:31.751 --> 27:34.821
Mr. Briggs should not have
left the hospital.

27:39.726 --> 27:41.227
Look,
I know what you're thinking.

27:41.260 --> 27:42.428
No.

27:42.461 --> 27:44.731
I should take her
in to live with me.

27:44.764 --> 27:47.867
Other people put their families
in places like this.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.836
We do not put our family
in places like this.

27:49.869 --> 27:52.438
You are singlehandedly keeping
a charter school alive.

27:52.471 --> 27:53.840
You only go home to sleep.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.274
How are you supposed
to take care of her?

27:55.307 --> 27:58.945
- I could retire.
- No, you couldn't.

27:58.978 --> 28:03.415
Mira, it's not so bad.
Maybe she'll like it.

28:03.449 --> 28:04.784
It smells.

28:04.817 --> 28:06.285
They're cooking lunch,
Abuelita.

28:06.318 --> 28:09.922
- What are they cooking, skunk?
- Mama.

28:09.956 --> 28:11.991
Rafie has gone
through a lot of trouble

28:12.024 --> 28:14.026
to arrange this for you.

28:14.060 --> 28:17.429
I didn't ask him to.

28:17.463 --> 28:22.201
Why should I move
after 40 years?

28:22.234 --> 28:23.970
Because here,
nobody has to carry groceries

28:24.003 --> 28:26.505
up six flights of stairs,
Abuelita.

28:26.538 --> 28:29.842
They have activities.
Mira, movies.

28:29.876 --> 28:31.811
If you fall down again,
[speaks Spanish]

28:31.844 --> 28:33.645
anything, you just push
a button.

28:33.679 --> 28:36.682
If I fall down at home,
I bang on the floor--

28:36.783 --> 28:37.984
Mrs. Rivera hears.

28:38.017 --> 28:41.287
- Mommy?
- We'll think about it.

28:41.320 --> 28:43.222
I'm just trying
to help both you.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.656
Bye.

28:44.690 --> 28:47.193
I have to go.
I'm needed in court.

28:48.427 --> 28:51.798
Good, go help somebody else.

28:58.170 --> 28:59.571
Yeah, it was around the time

28:59.605 --> 29:02.441
my father's health
started to deteriorate.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.610
Charmaine stopped letting us
visit him.

29:04.643 --> 29:07.546
She made excuses at first,
like he was having a bad day,

29:07.579 --> 29:10.917
and then she stopped
making excuses.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.384
It hurt us deeply.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.486
Your Honor, the charge
is manslaughter,

29:14.520 --> 29:16.555
not being mean to stepdaughters.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.390
Move it along, Mr. Barba.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.292
Miss Briggs, tell us
about the day your stepmother

29:20.326 --> 29:22.494
removed your father
from the hospital.

29:22.528 --> 29:23.896
My sister went to court

29:23.930 --> 29:25.731
to get an order
allowing us to visit him.

29:25.832 --> 29:27.433
Was the defendant
aware of this?

29:27.466 --> 29:29.135
Yes, that's why she ripped him
out of there.

29:29.168 --> 29:31.003
Anything to keep us
from seeing him.

29:31.037 --> 29:32.939
- Move to strike.
- Sustained.

29:32.972 --> 29:34.573
(Barba)
Okay. Did you ever find out

29:34.606 --> 29:36.575
why the defendant did not want
you to see your father?

29:36.608 --> 29:38.845
I assume it was
about his will.

29:38.845 --> 29:40.679
I don't know if she was trying
to get him to change it

29:40.712 --> 29:42.314
or she was afraid we would.

29:42.348 --> 29:44.183
Move to strike.
She says she doesn't know.

29:44.216 --> 29:45.484
Or maybe she just hated us.

29:45.517 --> 29:46.853
- Your Honor?
- Sustained.

29:46.886 --> 29:50.589
The jury will disregard.
[cell phone dings]

29:50.622 --> 29:53.625
- Mrs. Briggs?
[cell phone dings]

29:53.659 --> 29:58.130
[cell phone dings]
- Oh, my God.

29:58.164 --> 30:02.334
- Is there a problem?
- Could be, Your Honor.

30:02.368 --> 30:06.138
It's a video message
from Walter Briggs.

30:15.247 --> 30:15.447
.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.950
Now, if anyone is still
reading Fred Worth's books

30:17.984 --> 30:19.785
by the time you see this,

30:19.818 --> 30:21.620
that could only be because
it's part of their punishment

30:21.653 --> 30:23.455
at a state penitentiary.

30:23.489 --> 30:24.891
He spends the first
ten minutes

30:24.924 --> 30:26.592
trashing his literary rivals.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.995
Well, God forbid a feud
should end just because he died.

30:29.028 --> 30:30.062
Where did this come from?

30:30.096 --> 30:31.730
It's an internet service

30:31.763 --> 30:33.265
that sends messages
to your loved ones post mortem.

30:33.299 --> 30:34.633
They recorded it
three years ago.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.835
His obituary
triggered its release.

30:36.869 --> 30:38.971
For an extra fee,
they set it to music.

30:39.005 --> 30:42.174
Now I want to talk
to the people I love.

30:42.208 --> 30:45.912
My beautiful wife, Charmaine,
who saved my life,

30:45.945 --> 30:50.649
and my daughters, whom I love
despite the way they treated me.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.284
The way they treated him?

30:52.318 --> 30:54.686
He certainly had a different
view on it than we do.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.956
He had dementia.
I mean, he was confused.

30:56.989 --> 30:59.959
He doesn't look confused here.

30:59.992 --> 31:02.761
Their mothers
turned them against Charmaine.

31:02.794 --> 31:07.033
They were rude to her--
rude to my wife in my own home.

31:07.066 --> 31:09.568
I talked to his daughters.
They knew nothing about this.

31:09.601 --> 31:12.338
Can the other side use
this in court?

31:12.371 --> 31:14.173
They'll find a way.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.713
(Worth)
Delilah, I love you,

31:21.747 --> 31:24.283
but you wanted
to have it both ways.

31:24.316 --> 31:25.952
For years,
you wouldn't speak to me

31:25.985 --> 31:29.288
because of that incident
with your mother.

31:29.321 --> 31:30.856
Now, that would be
the occasion

31:30.957 --> 31:32.959
where he threw your mother
through a closed window?

31:32.959 --> 31:35.061
- Yes.
- Okay.

31:35.094 --> 31:38.764
But when your career
in the theater went to nothing

31:38.797 --> 31:41.533
and you wrote
that dreadful adaptation

31:41.567 --> 31:44.603
of The Fifth Assailant
without my permission,

31:44.636 --> 31:47.873
you began coming around,
pestering me for the rights.

31:47.974 --> 31:51.710
(Worth)
It just became too tedious
to see you.

31:51.743 --> 31:55.114
You testified yesterday
that Mrs. Briggs barred you

31:55.147 --> 31:57.383
from seeing your father
because of his will,

31:57.416 --> 31:59.151
or she hated you.

31:59.185 --> 32:00.319
Is that still your contention?

32:00.352 --> 32:01.720
Yes, I still believe it.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.189
So you don't believe
your father?

32:03.222 --> 32:06.025
I believe he was under
her influence--her spell.

32:06.058 --> 32:09.996
(Heller)
I see.

32:09.996 --> 32:12.664
Charmaine was sentimental.

32:12.698 --> 32:16.235
She thought a father should see
his children whenever,

32:16.268 --> 32:19.371
no matter what.

32:19.405 --> 32:23.542
But I had to insist
it was best for us all.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.215
When Walter
went into the hospital,

32:29.248 --> 32:31.850
I knew he didn't have long.

32:31.883 --> 32:36.355
I wanted him to die in peace
without being pestered,

32:36.388 --> 32:39.058
and in a beautiful place.

32:39.091 --> 32:44.696
There was a lake in Quebec
where we had happy times.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.232
And what about medical care?

32:46.265 --> 32:48.034
There couldn't have
been much at the lake.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.501
He was dying.

32:49.535 --> 32:50.902
He knew it,

32:50.936 --> 32:53.872
and he had the courage
to face it.

32:53.905 --> 32:55.874
He was the bravest man
I've ever known.

32:55.907 --> 32:58.910
Did you tell him why you were
taking him out of the hospital?

32:58.944 --> 33:00.212
I didn't have to.

33:00.246 --> 33:01.847
He had made it very clear

33:01.880 --> 33:04.516
that he didn't want
to die surrounded by tubes

33:04.550 --> 33:06.352
and machines.

33:06.385 --> 33:09.055
Now, we've heard testimony
that before the heart attack

33:09.055 --> 33:11.457
you gave your husband
erectile dysfunction pills

33:11.490 --> 33:15.061
without his knowledge.

33:15.061 --> 33:19.065
He was very...proud.

33:19.065 --> 33:21.300
He wanted to feel like a man,

33:21.333 --> 33:26.805
and he didn't need to know
that a drug was helping him.

33:26.838 --> 33:30.142
I wanted to have his child.

33:30.176 --> 33:32.544
To get another share
of the estate?

33:32.578 --> 33:36.548
No, because I loved
my husband.

33:36.582 --> 33:41.287
I've never met anyone in my life
like Walter Briggs,

33:41.320 --> 33:43.889
and I wanted to have a piece
of him with me forever,

33:43.922 --> 33:46.825
and I wanted the world
to have another piece of him.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.627
Thank you, Mrs. Briggs.

33:48.660 --> 33:50.396
I'm sorry for your loss,

33:50.429 --> 33:54.400
and I am very sorry
that you have to be here today.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.371
Your husband's doctor
testified that he might have

33:59.405 --> 34:01.173
recovered,
but you knew he was dying.

34:01.207 --> 34:02.574
Which medical school
did you attend?

34:02.608 --> 34:03.642
Objection.

34:03.675 --> 34:05.244
Mr. Barba?

34:05.277 --> 34:07.379
I knew he didn't want
to be in that hospital.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.548
But you didn't remove him
until after you had learned

34:09.581 --> 34:11.317
that his daughters
had won visitation rights.

34:11.350 --> 34:13.285
- Seeing them distressed him.
- Right.

34:13.319 --> 34:17.556
And you knew he wanted
to die in peace?

34:17.589 --> 34:18.557
Yes.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.126
So you peacefully yanked him

34:20.159 --> 34:21.627
out of his hospital bed
with a hep-lock in his arm.

34:21.660 --> 34:22.994
He didn't want to be there.

34:23.028 --> 34:24.163
You lied about where you
were taking him,

34:24.196 --> 34:25.797
put him in an ambulance,

34:25.831 --> 34:27.333
pulled him out of that ambulance
in midtown Manhattan,

34:27.366 --> 34:28.467
shoved him in a taxi...

34:28.500 --> 34:29.935
He didn't need an ambulance.

34:29.968 --> 34:31.737
And then you took him
to Westchester

34:31.770 --> 34:34.140
to wait in an airplane hangar
without oxygen, medication,

34:34.173 --> 34:35.907
or professional supervision.

34:35.941 --> 34:38.244
He was happy.

34:38.277 --> 34:40.146
He wasn't suffering.
He was with me.

34:40.146 --> 34:41.347
Not until the fatal
heart attack

34:41.380 --> 34:42.781
that occurred shortly
thereafter.

34:42.814 --> 34:44.916
Which could have happened
at any time.

34:44.950 --> 34:47.153
And that gave you the right
to make it happen sooner?

34:47.153 --> 34:50.922
- Your Honor?
- Withdrawn.

34:50.956 --> 34:52.424
No further questions.

34:52.458 --> 34:54.760
The witness may step down.

34:57.696 --> 34:59.765
Ms. Heller, your next witness.

34:59.798 --> 35:02.901
The defense calls Judith Briggs.

35:05.404 --> 35:08.940
Your Honor.

35:08.974 --> 35:10.008
She wasn't on the list.
She's been sitting here

35:10.041 --> 35:11.677
listening to other witnesses.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.412
She didn't hear anything
she didn't already know,

35:13.445 --> 35:17.048
and she only just offered
to testify.

35:18.083 --> 35:20.186
I will allow it.

35:20.186 --> 35:23.021
I'll give you an hour
to prepare.

35:31.263 --> 35:31.463
.

35:31.497 --> 35:33.699
Judith, I can't believe
you're gonna testify

35:33.732 --> 35:35.201
for that bitch.

35:35.201 --> 35:36.535
After I saw Dad's video,

35:36.568 --> 35:39.605
I finally understood
what was going on.

35:39.638 --> 35:42.007
I stopped seeing him

35:42.040 --> 35:44.776
because you told me
Charmaine wouldn't let us visit,

35:44.810 --> 35:46.512
but it was just you.

35:46.545 --> 35:48.680
No, she forced him
to make that video.

35:48.714 --> 35:49.748
She hates us both.

35:49.781 --> 35:51.283
Delilah, please,
just one minute.

35:51.317 --> 35:52.951
Judith, what do you intend
to say on the stand?

35:52.984 --> 35:54.953
That my sister lied to me.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.855
Charmaine hates us both!

35:56.888 --> 35:58.790
She didn't want
either of us there.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.259
I was just a scapegoat.

36:00.292 --> 36:02.228
I've always been the scapegoat
in this family.

36:02.228 --> 36:04.230
Delilah, stop.

36:04.230 --> 36:06.865
This is all about your play,
isn't it?

36:06.898 --> 36:09.668
That play was supposed
to be her big break.

36:09.701 --> 36:11.036
She told me it fell through

36:11.069 --> 36:13.239
because she
couldn't get funding.

36:13.239 --> 36:15.106
I couldn't get funding 'cause
Dad wouldn't give me the rights.

36:15.140 --> 36:17.509
He was so arrogant.
You know that.

36:17.543 --> 36:19.478
It couldn't be good
unless he wrote it himself.

36:19.511 --> 36:20.679
Besides, I was a girl.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.314
How could a girl
be a good writer?

36:22.348 --> 36:24.816
How could a girl
compare herself to him?

36:24.850 --> 36:27.018
I called him
on his stupid prejudices.

36:27.052 --> 36:29.255
That's what he couldn't take.

36:29.255 --> 36:31.257
- Are we interrupting?
- Blessedly.

36:31.257 --> 36:34.360
- We're in a conference.
- With my witness.

36:34.393 --> 36:36.262
Let's cut to the chase.

36:36.262 --> 36:37.529
The good little sister's gonna

36:37.563 --> 36:39.798
take the stand
and demolish your case

36:39.831 --> 36:43.369
by proving that my client
was right to keep Delilah away.

36:43.402 --> 36:44.836
Scintillating family drama,

36:44.870 --> 36:47.573
but that does not give
Mrs. Briggs license

36:47.606 --> 36:49.140
to recklessly cause
her husband's death.

36:49.174 --> 36:50.876
If I could have kept
him alive,

36:50.909 --> 36:52.578
I would have done anything,

36:52.611 --> 36:54.546
but we both knew
it was only a matter of days.

36:54.580 --> 36:56.282
His mind was gone.
He didn't know anything.

36:56.282 --> 36:57.983
No, he had moments of clarity

36:58.016 --> 37:00.151
and when they came, he was
adamant about what he wanted.

37:00.185 --> 37:02.288
- He didn't want to be raped.
- Oh, God.

37:02.321 --> 37:06.625
Delilah, for once
in your life, just stop.

37:08.494 --> 37:09.928
One thing I know...

37:09.961 --> 37:14.633
My father wouldn't
want any of this.

37:14.666 --> 37:17.135
We don't either.
Counselor?

37:17.168 --> 37:19.137
Your client pleads to
criminally negligent homicide,

37:19.170 --> 37:20.138
does one year.

37:20.171 --> 37:21.440
No, not good enough.

37:21.473 --> 37:23.775
I might consider
reckless endangerment.

37:23.809 --> 37:25.577
- First or second?
- First.

37:25.611 --> 37:28.447
- It's still a felony.
- I could accept probation.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.416
You know what, we'll take it
to court and get an acquittal.

37:30.449 --> 37:32.083
You know what, we can.
We're due in court right now.

37:32.117 --> 37:36.322
- Let's go.
- No--let's end this.

37:36.355 --> 37:38.189
I'll take it on one condition--

37:38.223 --> 37:42.428
that she is not allowed to ruin
Walter's work with her bad play.

37:42.461 --> 37:46.665
He didn't want that,
so I don't want it.

37:46.698 --> 37:50.336
Judith.

37:50.336 --> 37:53.339
Delilah?
You know I love you.

37:53.339 --> 37:55.841
But I have to respect
dad's wishes.

37:55.874 --> 38:00.045
Then the vote will be tied.
I'll take you to court.

38:00.078 --> 38:03.081
No.
It won't be tied.

38:03.114 --> 38:06.251
I may be cut out, but there's a
third vote that I will control.

38:06.352 --> 38:10.589
Your new brother or sister.

38:10.622 --> 38:15.427
A fertility clinic implanted
a surrogate with an embryo--

38:15.461 --> 38:18.797
my egg and Walter's sperm.

38:18.830 --> 38:20.899
They're all doing fine.

38:20.932 --> 38:22.233
Okay, then.

38:22.267 --> 38:24.536
We have a deal
and you have a child.

38:24.570 --> 38:26.137
Mazel tov.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.141
One year's probation?

38:30.175 --> 38:31.610
She killed her husband.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.779
Well, one might argue
that she kept him alive.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.080
And I do believe
that she loved him.

38:35.113 --> 38:36.382
So what, people can't
love somebody

38:36.415 --> 38:38.116
and still hasten their demise?

38:38.149 --> 38:39.918
Carisi, I know you admire
the guy, but there was no way

38:39.951 --> 38:42.087
a jury was gonna
put Charmaine in jail.

38:42.120 --> 38:45.457
And the daughters
are okay with this?

38:45.491 --> 38:46.792
One of them is.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.560
Judith?

38:48.594 --> 38:51.129
Talk to her yourself.

38:51.162 --> 38:52.664
That's a good idea.

38:54.933 --> 38:58.937
- Families.
- How's your grandmother?

38:58.970 --> 39:01.607
Still giving me grief about
moving her out of that walk-up

39:01.640 --> 39:04.410
deathtrap she somehow confused
with Shangri-La.

39:04.410 --> 39:07.479
- She didn't like the facility?
- No, she didn't.

39:07.513 --> 39:09.548
But it can't be her choice
anymore.

39:09.581 --> 39:13.251
So we're starting to pack up
her things, under protest.

39:13.284 --> 39:16.021
That's hard.

39:16.054 --> 39:19.558
- You are a good grandson.
- No, I'm not.

39:19.591 --> 39:22.494
I'm over-compensating.

39:22.528 --> 39:25.864
What are you gonna be doing
when you're 85?

39:25.897 --> 39:29.200
Squabbling with you?

39:29.234 --> 39:31.169
Wouldn't that be nice?

39:35.574 --> 39:39.778
I thought you might like
to have this.

39:39.811 --> 39:42.948
- The Fifth Assailant?
- First edition.

39:46.452 --> 39:48.186
And autographed.

39:48.219 --> 39:50.522
I know you admired my father.

39:50.556 --> 39:54.760
I did.
Thank you.

39:54.793 --> 39:57.796
So now you're left
to clean up your father's--

39:57.829 --> 39:59.565
Affairs?

39:59.598 --> 40:03.869
You can say it.
He was a charmer.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.304
Charmaine asked me to go
through his papers.

40:06.337 --> 40:08.273
His publisher is bringing out
his collected works

40:08.306 --> 40:09.575
in a new edition.

40:09.608 --> 40:14.379
He deserves that.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.482
I wish you could have
known him...

40:16.515 --> 40:18.717
When he was all there.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.656
I do.

40:31.262 --> 40:33.064
Mommy?

40:33.098 --> 40:35.901
Raf.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.972
I came over to help her go
through her things, you know,

40:41.006 --> 40:43.509
just to help
her go through her stuff.

40:43.542 --> 40:46.778
And I buzzed the buzzer
and--and there was no answer.

40:46.812 --> 40:48.079
So, you know, I've got a key,

40:48.113 --> 40:50.482
so I came in,
went up the stairs,

40:50.516 --> 40:53.151
got into the apartment,
walked down the hallway,

40:53.184 --> 40:56.321
and she was lying on her bed.

40:56.354 --> 40:59.625
I love you, Mommy.
I'm so sorry.

40:59.658 --> 41:03.261
I never should have
agreed to this.

41:03.294 --> 41:06.532
She told us
she didn't want to move.

41:06.532 --> 41:07.999
I should've moved in with her,
I should've--

41:08.033 --> 41:09.367
I should've quit the job.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.702
Mommy.
Mommy, no.

41:10.736 --> 41:15.006
It was me, okay?

41:15.040 --> 41:20.011
She said she wanted to die
in her own home.

41:20.045 --> 41:22.681
And she did.

41:22.714 --> 41:25.684
Hey, come.

41:25.717 --> 41:28.554
Oh, God.
