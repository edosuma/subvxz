00:41.141 --> 00:42.301
Susan?

00:47.821 --> 00:49.701
Good evening, everyone,

00:49.741 --> 00:52.620
and thank you all
for coming tonight.

00:52.660 --> 00:56.540
The police officer who is about to
speak to you needs no introduction.

00:56.580 --> 00:58.781
As Detective Chief Superintendent,

00:58.821 --> 01:01.101
she has made waves
in this community.

01:02.101 --> 01:05.421
Crime figures have fallen
with her at the helm.

01:05.461 --> 01:09.660
Impressively, she has slashed
drug and gang-related offences.

01:10.580 --> 01:14.340
Our new multi-force police station
opens tomorrow...

01:14.381 --> 01:17.421
and who better to head up
our new joint police service

01:17.460 --> 01:21.740
than Detective Chief Superintendent
Elizabeth Bancroft?

01:29.501 --> 01:31.020
Thank you.

01:31.061 --> 01:33.541
Don't know about you lot, but
I'm just here for the free booze.

01:39.141 --> 01:41.660
Now, I know some of you are worried

01:41.701 --> 01:45.020
about the possible ramifications
of this merger.

01:45.061 --> 01:47.501
Will there be enough police
on the street?

01:48.701 --> 01:54.180
Will we be able to respond quickly
and effectively to call-outs?

01:54.220 --> 01:55.701
Well...

01:55.740 --> 01:58.781
this is going to be a challenge.

01:58.820 --> 02:00.981
But in partnership
with the Chief Constable...

02:02.020 --> 02:06.781
.. I will work tirelessly
to keep our community safe.

02:10.701 --> 02:11.781
Thank you.

02:25.861 --> 02:27.620
You're working to keep
the community safe.

02:28.900 --> 02:31.620
If it wasn't so outrageous,
it'd be funny.

02:31.661 --> 02:32.900
You're pissed, Cliff.

02:32.941 --> 02:35.141
You shouldn't have been up there,

02:35.180 --> 02:36.261
you should be in prison.

02:36.300 --> 02:39.261
You know the IOPC exonerated me
for the death of Kamara.

02:39.300 --> 02:41.300
Now, why don't you just let it drop?
Athif Kamara?

02:41.340 --> 02:42.780
This is about Katherine.

02:46.580 --> 02:48.780
You clearly weren't listening
to the Chief, were you?

02:49.900 --> 02:51.661
This merger...

02:51.701 --> 02:53.020
is about productivity.

02:55.180 --> 02:58.060
Now, HR have drawn up a list
and I am fighting for you, but...

02:58.101 --> 03:00.221
You can't make me retire.

03:00.261 --> 03:02.421
Well, you're not the policeman
you used to be, Cliff.

03:03.421 --> 03:06.421
It's time to accept that.
Go back to your family.

03:08.101 --> 03:10.460
Does Katherine come back at you
in your nightmares?

03:24.541 --> 03:26.060
'She's out of theatre.

03:26.101 --> 03:28.261
'They've put her
in a medically-induced coma.'

03:34.541 --> 03:36.340
I will bring you down.

03:36.381 --> 03:38.101
Poor Katherine.

04:30.140 --> 04:31.341
Thank you.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.300
CAR ENGINE STARTS

04:57.300 --> 04:58.300
Joe.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.820
Who's that?
The victims' son.

06:30.861 --> 06:33.221
He lives in a cottage
on the property.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.740
Did he find 'em?

06:34.781 --> 06:37.180
He came round with the newspapers
this morning.

06:37.221 --> 06:38.781
DI Morris?

06:38.820 --> 06:40.180
He's inside.

07:32.461 --> 07:34.101
Two dead.

07:34.140 --> 07:36.820
Michael Connors, property developer,

07:36.861 --> 07:38.981
and his wife, Susan.

07:39.021 --> 07:40.021
Yeah, I've heard of him.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.740
That's his first wife.

07:46.620 --> 07:48.300
Second wife is in here.

08:06.541 --> 08:08.781
Well, you were right
to get me out here.

08:08.820 --> 08:11.180
Bad enough Michael Connors
being a well-known figure,

08:11.221 --> 08:13.380
but with this level of violence...

08:13.421 --> 08:16.101
.. it's gonna be a high-profile case.
Was there anything stolen?

08:16.140 --> 08:17.861
Not by the looks of things.

08:17.901 --> 08:20.060
Right, well,
I'm gonna get back to the station,

08:20.101 --> 08:21.140
get ahead of the press.

08:40.981 --> 08:42.101
Joe.

08:45.380 --> 08:47.540
That's my elder brother, Adam.

08:47.581 --> 08:50.620
Who's she?
My step-sister, Annabel.

08:50.660 --> 08:52.941
Is Annabel local?
No.

08:52.981 --> 08:54.341
She moved away.

08:54.380 --> 08:56.500
She's training to be a doctor.

08:56.540 --> 08:58.500
And him?

08:58.540 --> 09:00.660
Annabel's boyfriend, Joe.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.500
Did you know Joe was going out
with her?

09:14.540 --> 09:15.701
No.

09:15.740 --> 09:19.380
No. I-I-I knew he'd transferred
to another hospital, and that's it.

09:19.420 --> 09:20.701
Well, when did you last see him?

09:21.981 --> 09:23.620
Er, Katherine Stevenson's funeral.

09:25.061 --> 09:26.581
Yeah, I remember he was devastated.

09:28.101 --> 09:30.020
Yeah, well, we all were.

09:30.061 --> 09:33.221
And you haven't talked to him since?
No, I...

09:33.260 --> 09:34.701
I mean, I've tried...

09:35.701 --> 09:38.341
What did you argue about
in the first place?

09:38.380 --> 09:41.620
Nothing, nothing serious,
just stupid stuff, you know.

09:41.660 --> 09:43.821
Listen, you will tell me
if he comes here, won't you?

09:46.620 --> 09:47.900
George, please.

10:00.380 --> 10:01.821
Sorry, I've got to go.

10:04.101 --> 10:06.020
What are you doing?

10:06.061 --> 10:07.981
I've been told to set up in here.

10:08.020 --> 10:09.461
This is my office.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.941
Sorry, Guv, orders.
Whose?

10:13.981 --> 10:15.981
DI Morris should be seconded
to the Connors' case.

10:16.020 --> 10:17.140
He was first on the scene.

10:18.620 --> 10:20.181
Give it to Jake Harper.

10:21.301 --> 10:23.981
Well, is he any good?
He has an excellent record...

10:24.020 --> 10:26.181
a conviction on every case
he's been on.

10:26.221 --> 10:28.461
And we need someone
that doesn't know you, because of...

10:29.581 --> 10:31.540
I'm sorry,
I've forgotten your son's name.

10:31.581 --> 10:32.620
Joe.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.821
You have to keep yourself completely
separate from this investigation.

10:38.380 --> 10:40.780
Yes, no, Frances, absolutely,
I'll keep out of it.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.140
What've you got there?

11:17.181 --> 11:19.181
Drugs data for the two forces.

11:19.221 --> 11:22.020
Our stats blow theirs away,
of course.

11:22.061 --> 11:25.701
Yes, well, we all know how
Bancroft's cleaned up this city.

11:25.740 --> 11:26.941
It's not just her,

11:26.981 --> 11:29.181
I practically run the unit.

11:29.221 --> 11:30.221
And I'm still not DI.

11:31.701 --> 11:33.701
I would have been
if this merger hadn't kicked in.

11:33.740 --> 11:36.260
If you deserve the promotion, Bevan,
you'll get it.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.581
You've been administrating
the merger?

11:39.620 --> 11:41.861
That's right, yes.
It's gonna be really productive.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.301
Productive, my ass!

11:43.341 --> 11:46.260
It's about cuts and selling off
police stations.

11:46.301 --> 11:48.020
Well...

11:48.061 --> 11:49.620
I'm looking forward
to collaborating.

11:49.660 --> 11:51.821
The sooner we start
information sharing, the better.

11:51.861 --> 11:53.821
Sorry, you are?
Jake Harper, Guv.

11:53.861 --> 11:56.260
Detective Superintendent, homicide.

11:56.301 --> 11:59.140
Ah, the lead on the Connors case.

11:59.181 --> 12:00.861
Good to meet you.

12:00.900 --> 12:02.301
Right, listen up, everyone.

12:05.581 --> 12:08.701
Michael Connors was attacked
on the ground floor.

12:08.740 --> 12:11.020
Susan, upstairs in the bathroom.

12:11.061 --> 12:13.740
Looks like the attacker,
or attackers,

12:13.780 --> 12:15.780
came in through the back.
They left out the front.

12:15.821 --> 12:18.260
Any CCTV on the property?
No.

12:18.301 --> 12:20.780
According to, er, Martin,
the stepson,

12:20.821 --> 12:22.500
Michael and Susan
were lax with security.

12:22.540 --> 12:25.420
At some point, the attackers
keyed the Connors' car.

12:25.461 --> 12:28.620
Why bother, unless you've got
a grudge against the victims?

12:28.660 --> 12:30.020
It feels personal.

12:30.061 --> 12:32.660
Michael Connors came from nothing,
he made a mint fast,

12:32.701 --> 12:34.821
he was known for being ruthless.

12:34.861 --> 12:36.780
At work, he ruffled feathers.

12:36.821 --> 12:38.620
Family's complicated too.

12:38.660 --> 12:43.181
Martin and Adam Mullen are Susan's
children, Michael's stepsons.

12:43.221 --> 12:44.660
Adam works for Michael's company,

12:44.701 --> 12:47.140
Martin does odd jobs
around the house and estate.

12:47.181 --> 12:50.861
Michael had one daughter
from a previous wife, Annabel.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.461
Her mother died in an accident.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.181
Have all the children been informed?

12:55.221 --> 12:57.140
Family liaison's with them now.

12:58.181 --> 13:00.341
How often did you all
see your parents?

13:03.061 --> 13:05.020
Most days.

13:05.061 --> 13:07.581
There was always something
needed doing.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.420
I worked with Michael,
so, like Martin,

13:10.461 --> 13:12.140
pretty much every day.

13:12.181 --> 13:14.500
I'm a junior doctor,
so I don't get home much, but...

13:15.941 --> 13:18.101
.. Dad came to take me out,
and I talk...

13:19.181 --> 13:21.181
.. I talked on the phone to him
a lot.

13:23.020 --> 13:24.660
Is there anyone,

13:24.701 --> 13:26.821
that any of you can think of, who...

13:26.861 --> 13:28.581
who might have had a grudge
against them?

13:56.020 --> 13:57.020
Joe.

13:58.941 --> 14:00.780
I, um...

14:00.821 --> 14:01.861
I came to find you.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.740
God, you look, um...

14:04.780 --> 14:06.301
Um, I mean, you...

14:07.740 --> 14:08.981
You just, you look different.

14:12.981 --> 14:14.101
Um...

14:14.140 --> 14:16.260
So, did you come up here with...?

14:16.301 --> 14:17.581
Annabel.
Annabel, yes.

14:18.780 --> 14:21.260
It's just, um, terrible
about her parents.

14:28.861 --> 14:29.900
So, how are you?

14:31.061 --> 14:33.420
How's the hospital?

14:33.461 --> 14:35.660
I don't do that any more.
Right, so what?

14:35.701 --> 14:37.020
Did you, did you leave?

14:39.181 --> 14:40.500
Oh.

14:40.540 --> 14:42.701
So, what-what are you doing now?
You got another job?

14:47.740 --> 14:50.181
OK, um, well, if you need any money,

14:50.221 --> 14:52.581
or anywhere to stay...
I should probably get back,

14:52.620 --> 14:55.701
she's gonna wonder where I am...
Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe. Joe, just...

14:58.581 --> 14:59.981
Nothing is the same without you.

15:02.061 --> 15:05.260
We just need to spend a bit of time
with each other. We just...

15:05.301 --> 15:07.140
We just need to talk things...

15:07.181 --> 15:08.380
Annabel and I are engaged.

15:11.181 --> 15:13.500
You hardly know each other!
Well, we're getting married.

15:13.540 --> 15:15.500
What?

15:15.540 --> 15:16.540
Joe?

15:19.341 --> 15:20.341
What-what's going on?

15:22.101 --> 15:23.620
Hello. I'm...

15:23.660 --> 15:26.181
I'm so sorry for your loss.

15:26.221 --> 15:27.380
Who are you?

15:28.780 --> 15:30.701
I'm Elizabeth Bancroft,
I'm Joe's mother.

15:31.981 --> 15:33.780
Your mother...

15:37.821 --> 15:39.061
You told me she was dead.

15:55.026 --> 15:59.786
I regret to say
that Michael and Susan Connors

15:59.825 --> 16:03.465
were found dead in their home
yesterday morning.

16:05.345 --> 16:08.786
The family are understandably
devastated.

16:10.546 --> 16:12.426
A full investigation is underway.

16:13.585 --> 16:16.426
A number of our enquiries

16:16.465 --> 16:18.945
are at very early stages,

16:18.985 --> 16:22.026
with forensic teams
remaining at the scene,

16:22.065 --> 16:25.626
gathering evidence
as part of this investigation.

16:27.506 --> 16:29.626
Get it in, move on.

16:29.666 --> 16:31.585
'.. at ten minutes past eight
this morning,

16:31.626 --> 16:33.506
'the police were called
to a house...'

16:33.546 --> 16:35.705
How can I?
After what she did to Katherine.

16:36.585 --> 16:39.906
Dad, you have to stop
talking about that.

16:39.945 --> 16:42.786
There's no proof
she murdered Katherine.

16:43.945 --> 16:46.465
Forget it.
They have requested...

16:46.506 --> 16:47.786
Forget Bancroft.

16:50.306 --> 16:53.546
'We are offering full support,
and assistance,

16:53.585 --> 16:55.546
'during this difficult time.'

17:12.546 --> 17:14.825
What happened?
Suspected drug OD.

17:14.865 --> 17:16.704
It's the third this week.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.146
There's a bad batch out there.

17:21.265 --> 17:22.265
OK.

17:22.305 --> 17:23.386
Is she stable?

17:27.586 --> 17:29.745
All right, I'll be at the hospital
in ten minutes.

17:35.505 --> 17:38.465
Yeah.
It's a bit of a mixed bag, Guv.

17:38.505 --> 17:40.346
Michael Connor's stepson, Martin,

17:40.386 --> 17:42.545
has a history of violence
against Michael.

17:42.586 --> 17:44.505
He, er, broke a couple of his ribs
this Christmas.

17:44.545 --> 17:46.305
Oh. Boxing Day in the true sense.

17:47.386 --> 17:50.265
We're bringing him in this morning,
with his siblings, um,

17:50.305 --> 17:52.265
keeping it unofficial
for the moment.

18:08.626 --> 18:10.785
Any forensics?
Male footprint at the scene.

18:13.505 --> 18:15.626
Sorry to interrupt, Guv.

18:15.666 --> 18:18.106
Press have figured out
the connection between you,

18:18.146 --> 18:19.785
Joe and the Connors.

18:19.826 --> 18:21.505
Right, well,
they were always going to.

18:23.346 --> 18:25.545
Which is why you need to keep
completely independent

18:25.586 --> 18:27.346
from the investigation.

18:27.386 --> 18:29.025
For your own good.

18:29.066 --> 18:30.426
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

18:31.666 --> 18:34.705
The news are reporting
that Joe's engaged to Annabel.

18:34.745 --> 18:36.265
Yeah. Yeah, it's true.

18:37.586 --> 18:39.745
What?
I've only just found out myself.

18:43.146 --> 18:45.346
The Guv hasn't seen Joe
for a couple of years.

18:47.305 --> 18:48.906
Why, if I may ask?

18:51.826 --> 18:53.465
You got any kids?

18:53.505 --> 18:55.505
No. I'm not married.

18:55.545 --> 18:57.426
Well, I brought up Joe on my own,

18:57.465 --> 18:59.866
as a single parent,
and that makes very strong ties.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.745
But there comes a time
in a child's life

19:01.785 --> 19:03.666
where they have to leave the nest.

19:05.586 --> 19:07.745
Joe's just asserting
his independence, that's all.

19:12.305 --> 19:13.465
Thank you.

19:13.505 --> 19:14.505
Guv.

19:21.945 --> 19:24.146
What's Joe like?
He's a good lad.

19:24.186 --> 19:26.106
But he's out of touch with his mum
for two years?

19:26.146 --> 19:27.626
That's weird.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.426
Check if he's got a criminal record.

19:29.465 --> 19:31.305
This is Bancroft's son
we're talking about.

19:31.346 --> 19:32.866
We need to keep an open mind.

19:32.906 --> 19:34.505
You can't update Bancroft.

19:34.545 --> 19:35.866
It could mess up everything.

19:37.745 --> 19:38.945
She needs to stay away.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.586
Yep.
'We've got a problem.'

20:08.626 --> 20:11.586
There's a 16-year-old girl
in hospital, critical.

20:11.626 --> 20:14.025
'Bad batch of coke suspected.'

20:14.066 --> 20:17.025
Another two lads were brought into
hospital last night from a rave.

20:17.066 --> 20:18.745
OK. Talk to him,
find out what's going on.

20:18.785 --> 20:22.025
Can't you?
No, Andy, I can't!

20:22.066 --> 20:23.346
It's day two of the joint force.

20:23.386 --> 20:25.545
And believe it or not,
I've got other stuff going on.

20:27.305 --> 20:29.626
It's the last thing I need
right now, so just contain it.

20:35.586 --> 20:37.705
Blunt weapon.

20:37.745 --> 20:39.225
Michael Connors falls to the floor.

20:40.426 --> 20:42.866
Probably on hands and knees.

20:42.906 --> 20:46.745
He's trying to get away,
crawling along the floor here.

20:48.346 --> 20:49.985
But he's hit again, here.

20:51.505 --> 20:52.505
He's whipped.

20:53.666 --> 20:55.985
What with?
Marks would suggest a belt.

20:57.666 --> 21:00.866
Blood spatter reaches
these surfaces.

21:00.906 --> 21:04.265
He then receives several blows
to the back of the head.

21:04.305 --> 21:06.586
I should be able to confirm
these were the cause of death.

21:09.426 --> 21:12.985
There was some kind of fight
between your father and...

21:13.985 --> 21:16.186
.. your stepbrother, Martin?

21:16.225 --> 21:17.745
Yeah.

21:17.785 --> 21:18.945
He was sticking up for us.

21:20.386 --> 21:22.386
For Joe, really.

21:23.426 --> 21:25.426
My dad's not great
when he's drunk too much.

21:27.386 --> 21:29.866
He started getting aggressive
with Joe.

21:29.906 --> 21:31.505
Martin tried to calm things down.

21:32.906 --> 21:33.945
He got between them...

21:35.626 --> 21:37.265
.. Dad fell.
Right.

21:38.985 --> 21:41.346
So, how was your father's
relationship with Joe?

21:41.386 --> 21:42.426
Good.

21:47.826 --> 21:49.985
Well, until Joe got sacked
from the hospital.

21:50.025 --> 21:51.225
Sacked?

21:51.265 --> 21:53.186
Yeah, he couldn't afford his digs,

21:53.225 --> 21:55.785
moved into my flat...

21:55.826 --> 21:57.626
My father wasn't keen on that.

22:00.545 --> 22:02.305
Sexual assault?

22:02.346 --> 22:05.305
I'd say no, but we'll confirm that.

22:05.346 --> 22:08.025
One thing,
fourth finger on her left hand

22:08.066 --> 22:09.666
appears to be freshly broken.

22:12.386 --> 22:14.265
Could be she broke the finger
in the struggle.

22:27.666 --> 22:29.265
You all right, Guv?

22:30.866 --> 22:33.945
It sounds like the Christmas bust-up
between Martin and Michael

22:33.985 --> 22:36.305
was just a family argument,
no more than that.

22:36.346 --> 22:39.265
What about Martin's alibi?
He was working at a petrol station

22:39.305 --> 22:41.265
the night of the murder.
We're checking.

22:45.146 --> 22:47.025
There is one other thing, Guv.

22:48.106 --> 22:52.826
Annabel said that there was aggro
between Joe Bancroft and her dad.

22:52.866 --> 22:54.346
Aggro?

22:54.386 --> 22:56.626
And I've checked with Adam...

22:56.666 --> 22:58.906
Michael was furious
about the engagement.

22:59.945 --> 23:02.146
Stopped her allowance,
tried to split 'em up.

23:03.186 --> 23:04.545
Do a background check on him:

23:04.586 --> 23:07.545
Cell site analysis, mobile, the lot.

23:17.026 --> 23:20.026
Joe's staying at
the Thistle And Rose hotel...

23:20.066 --> 23:22.306
with Annabel Connors.
Great, thanks, Lee.

23:27.386 --> 23:28.386
Lee, you can go.

23:36.066 --> 23:37.306
So, Cliff,

23:37.346 --> 23:39.066
what's it to be?

23:39.106 --> 23:41.066
I'm not doing Court Liaison,
you know that.

23:43.225 --> 23:44.905
A copy's gone to HR.

23:44.945 --> 23:46.225
Well, it's the right decision.

23:47.985 --> 23:49.425
You might be leaving soon after me.

23:50.826 --> 23:53.145
Son involved in a murder case.

23:55.106 --> 23:56.586
He's not involved.

23:57.945 --> 23:59.786
Semantics, never my strong suit.

24:01.266 --> 24:02.386
Data, though...

24:04.225 --> 24:06.026
These figures make
interesting reading.

24:06.066 --> 24:08.866
Drug crime last year
dropped dramatically for us,

24:08.905 --> 24:11.145
but rose sequentially
for the other force.

24:12.225 --> 24:13.586
So?

24:13.626 --> 24:16.106
Dealers get squeezed out
of one area, move somewhere else.

24:17.705 --> 24:20.026
Then, when the merger's announced,
three months ago,

24:20.066 --> 24:23.626
with you at the helm,
drug crime for both forces falls.

24:23.665 --> 24:26.026
Well, they've moved on again.

24:26.066 --> 24:27.745
Very convenient of them...

24:27.786 --> 24:29.225
and fortunate for you.

24:32.786 --> 24:36.425
I reckon you're controlling
the drug flow for this entire area.

24:38.026 --> 24:39.425
You're pissing in the wind, Cliff.

25:03.505 --> 25:04.705
Get me another one.

25:35.705 --> 25:39.066
I mean it, it's bad enough
sharing an office with new coppers,

25:39.106 --> 25:41.945
then I'm at the bedside of a teenage
girl who's about to drop dead.

25:43.786 --> 25:44.786
What?

25:44.826 --> 25:47.626
A, you've supplied some bad shit.

25:47.665 --> 25:50.425
B, you still haven't given us
the names of the dealers

25:50.465 --> 25:52.145
you supplied it to.

25:52.185 --> 25:53.465
That's not the deal, Daanish.

25:55.826 --> 25:58.546
We don't protect you for fun
or because we love you.

25:58.586 --> 26:00.425
Bancroft's pissed off.

26:00.465 --> 26:01.985
Whatever's out there's not mine.

26:03.786 --> 26:06.026
But I have heard there's some
new stuff on the street.

26:08.425 --> 26:10.266
So, who's selling it?

26:19.185 --> 26:20.826
What are you doing here?!

26:20.866 --> 26:22.306
Annabel's gonna come back...
Good.

26:22.346 --> 26:24.505
I wanna meet her again,
properly this time. No.

26:24.546 --> 26:26.826
What...
Why wouldn't she wanna meet me?

26:26.866 --> 26:28.786
Why's she so stressed out about me?

26:28.826 --> 26:31.185
Get out!
You never used to smoke weed!

26:31.225 --> 26:33.386
Yeah, after Katherine died,
I didn't wanna think.

26:38.225 --> 26:39.225
Er...

26:46.866 --> 26:48.066
Look, I'm...

26:49.786 --> 26:51.185
I know that you were upset.

26:53.546 --> 26:56.546
But after the funeral,
you-you just should have come home.

26:56.586 --> 26:57.586
You put her in danger.

26:57.626 --> 26:59.626
I don't know how you did it,
but you did.

26:59.665 --> 27:01.346
You were jealous of her
because of me.

27:01.386 --> 27:04.225
And if she hadn't had met me,
then she'd still be alive...

27:04.266 --> 27:05.786
This is ridiculous!

27:05.826 --> 27:08.306
W- Why? Why do you think like this?!

27:08.346 --> 27:10.665
How can I not think like that?!
I know that it's true!

27:17.026 --> 27:19.905
You haven't said this to anyone,
have you? What if I had?

27:19.945 --> 27:21.745
It would be problematic.
For who?

27:21.786 --> 27:22.905
For me!

27:24.346 --> 27:25.705
And for whoever else you told.

27:32.266 --> 27:33.505
I haven't told anyone.

27:34.905 --> 27:36.745
Not even Annabel?
No, not even her.

27:42.985 --> 27:44.546
Look at you.

27:47.665 --> 27:49.066
You're still my boy.

27:50.705 --> 27:52.905
I'll keep your secret...

27:56.905 --> 27:59.626
.. because I can't prove
what you did,

27:59.665 --> 28:01.985
and telling's not gonna
bring Katherine back.

28:03.626 --> 28:05.346
But I don't wanna see you. Ever.

28:08.866 --> 28:10.505
Annabel's all I care about now.

28:12.786 --> 28:14.626
Keep away from us.

29:23.505 --> 29:24.745
There you are.

29:26.306 --> 29:27.306
You OK?

29:30.626 --> 29:33.106
I'm here for you, you know I am.

29:33.145 --> 29:34.786
Mm.

29:34.826 --> 29:36.346
Well, come and join me then.

29:38.505 --> 29:41.026
Well, I haven't brought
my swimming stuff.

29:41.066 --> 29:43.066
Who cares?

29:43.106 --> 29:45.665
Come on!

35:04.091 --> 35:06.091
Thought you might want a pick-me-up.

35:06.130 --> 35:07.130
Ta.

35:10.011 --> 35:11.770
So, um...

35:11.810 --> 35:14.730
is Martin still the first line
of the investigation?

35:14.770 --> 35:17.011
Oh, his alibi holds up, um...

35:18.091 --> 35:21.091
There's CCTV footage of him
working at a petrol station.

35:22.611 --> 35:23.931
Who're they looking into now?

35:25.371 --> 35:27.690
I can't tell you, Guv.
Harper's a tight arse.

35:27.730 --> 35:29.170
Come on, he's not here, is he?

35:30.330 --> 35:31.411
Come on, George.

35:31.451 --> 35:33.611
If I talk to you,
he's gonna chuck me off this case.

35:36.330 --> 35:37.451
They considering Annabel?

35:42.810 --> 35:43.810
Nothing points to her.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.770
I think there's something
really off about her.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.371
I mean, she treats Joe like shit.

35:47.411 --> 35:49.130
All his girlfriends
treated him like shit!

35:49.170 --> 35:51.290
No, this is different. I mean...

35:51.330 --> 35:53.011
It's like a power thing.

35:53.051 --> 35:55.451
I mean, she wasn't exactly upset
about her parents, was she?

35:55.491 --> 35:57.051
I'd say she was devastated.

36:05.690 --> 36:09.250
Yeah? Joe Bancroft sent
abusive emails to Michael Connors,

36:09.290 --> 36:11.730
ranting about how Michael
was a control freak.

36:12.810 --> 36:14.971
"You can't get rid of me.
I'm not going anywhere."

36:15.011 --> 36:17.690
A day later, "You can take your
money and stick it where it hurts."

36:17.730 --> 36:19.011
Money?

36:19.051 --> 36:21.451
'Michael was trying to split them up
and pay Joe off.'

36:21.491 --> 36:23.130
Joe was furious.

36:23.170 --> 36:25.690
This gives Joe a motive. I'm calling
a briefing, where are you?

36:25.730 --> 36:27.051
Right, I'm on my way in.

36:31.250 --> 36:32.210
Well?

36:32.250 --> 36:33.411
No!

36:33.451 --> 36:34.451
George!

36:38.091 --> 36:39.290
Look, I mean it, Guv.

36:41.051 --> 36:42.451
There's too much riding on this.

37:17.051 --> 37:18.810
What part of "leave me alone"
don't you get?

37:18.850 --> 37:20.411
The police are looking into you.

37:21.650 --> 37:23.130
What?

37:23.170 --> 37:24.250
Well, what about?

37:24.290 --> 37:26.531
Well, The Connors' murder,
I presume.

37:26.571 --> 37:28.810
I- I haven't done anything.
What about Annabel, has she?

37:28.850 --> 37:30.011
No! No, of course not!

37:30.051 --> 37:33.451
Look, if either of you are hiding
anything, you have got to tell me.

37:33.491 --> 37:35.290
But we're not. I...

37:35.330 --> 37:36.850
I've got no idea
what you're on about.

37:36.891 --> 37:38.451
Listen, I've gotta go, um...

37:38.491 --> 37:40.491
it's probably nothing,
it's just routine checks.

37:40.531 --> 37:42.650
But don't talk to the police, OK?

37:46.891 --> 37:49.290
She's doing this to stress you out.

37:49.330 --> 37:50.451
You said, she lies to you.

37:50.491 --> 37:52.290
What did they ask you about
that night?

37:52.330 --> 37:54.091
They wanted to know where I was,
that's all.

37:54.130 --> 37:56.011
You're being paranoid.
Did they ask about me?

37:56.051 --> 37:57.971
Yeah, and I said
you were in the flat, with me.

38:00.730 --> 38:02.170
No, you weren't there.

38:02.210 --> 38:03.810
SHE SCOFFS
Of course I was there.

38:03.850 --> 38:05.650
No, I woke up...
You were off your face!

38:05.690 --> 38:07.931
No, I remember I got out of bed,
I looked for you.

38:07.971 --> 38:09.891
Where were you?
I was in the flat!

38:09.931 --> 38:11.250
No, Annabel!

38:13.650 --> 38:14.690
This is your mother...

38:16.730 --> 38:18.371
.. she's turning you against me.

38:18.411 --> 38:20.650
For some reason, they think
they've got something on us.

38:20.690 --> 38:22.011
So, we have to be really careful,

38:22.051 --> 38:24.770
and we have to be really honest
with each other. All right!

38:25.810 --> 38:27.531
I...

38:27.571 --> 38:29.770
I- I was gonna tell you, but...

38:32.690 --> 38:34.891
Well, you were passed out...

38:34.931 --> 38:37.411
I was so pissed off about Daddy
trying to break us up, I...

38:39.770 --> 38:41.011
I drove to the house.

38:42.971 --> 38:44.571
Your dad's house?

38:44.611 --> 38:45.611
Yeah.

38:47.650 --> 38:49.130
And did you see anything?

38:50.210 --> 38:51.411
No, the door was open...

38:52.650 --> 38:53.931
Daddy was on the floor, but...

38:53.971 --> 38:56.170
They were already dead,
it was awful.

38:56.210 --> 38:57.371
Blood everywhere.
HE GROANS

38:57.411 --> 38:59.130
No, Susan was upstairs, in the bath.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.730
Oh, why didn't you phone
the police?!

39:00.770 --> 39:03.690
I- I know, I should have, I just...

39:03.730 --> 39:05.011
I panicked!

39:07.051 --> 39:08.810
It was like my-my mother
all over again.

39:08.850 --> 39:11.571
The blood, everyone blaming me,
the police and their questions.

39:12.891 --> 39:14.770
OK, you're gonna have
to explain this to them.

39:14.810 --> 39:17.170
I- I just need to get
my head straight, Joe.

39:17.210 --> 39:19.971
There's too much going on,
I can't think.

39:20.011 --> 39:22.491
When you saw your dad, why did
you go upstairs to find Susan?

39:27.250 --> 39:29.371
I don't know, OK?!

39:29.411 --> 39:31.770
I don't know what I was doing!
Annabel...

39:31.810 --> 39:33.130
No, I just need to get out of here.

39:33.170 --> 39:35.330
You don't have to come.
I get it. You want to stay...

39:35.371 --> 39:36.770
No, no. I don't want to stay here.

39:36.810 --> 39:38.810
I want to be with you...
I don't know any more!

39:43.011 --> 39:44.531
Did we rush everything?
No!

39:44.571 --> 39:46.091
You know, the engagement?
No!

39:46.130 --> 39:48.051
No! No! Maybe you're not ready
for this, and...

39:48.091 --> 39:50.250
now with my parents dying,
everything's changed.

39:50.290 --> 39:52.051
No, nothing's changed.

39:53.451 --> 39:54.650
Nothing's changed.

40:00.091 --> 40:01.170
It's just...

40:15.051 --> 40:16.130
It's just a couple of days.

40:18.371 --> 40:19.491
That's all. Then...

40:20.850 --> 40:22.170
.. I'll talk to the police. I...

40:23.931 --> 40:25.130
I promise.

40:27.210 --> 40:28.330
I promise.

40:57.971 --> 41:00.770
I heard you come here every day.

41:00.810 --> 41:01.971
I'm not six feet under.

41:03.130 --> 41:04.130
You can come and see me.

41:06.690 --> 41:08.451
But no...

41:08.491 --> 41:09.770
you're back from Pakistan...

41:11.371 --> 41:13.051
.. we don't even get a visit, do we?

41:17.451 --> 41:20.650
What I do get, though,
is trouble on the streets.

41:20.690 --> 41:22.451
Bad drugs being sold
out of Highwater,

41:22.491 --> 41:24.371
by old mates of Athif.

41:25.850 --> 41:27.491
And I'm thinking to myself...

41:28.931 --> 41:31.770
.. are you muscling in
on my business, Mum?

41:31.810 --> 41:33.371
How did you make it your business?

41:34.451 --> 41:37.130
Athif was a leader.
I've got brains, right?

41:37.170 --> 41:40.571
I use... I know you told the police
where Athif was.

41:42.571 --> 41:44.371
Keep your fantasies to yourself,
will you?

41:48.051 --> 41:51.011
You chose Elizabeth Bancroft
over your own brother.

41:54.091 --> 41:56.411
You'll regret that, and so will she.

42:04.611 --> 42:05.611
Yeah?

42:07.250 --> 42:08.850
It's my mum supplying the drugs.

42:10.091 --> 42:11.170
Are you sure?
'Yeah.'

42:11.210 --> 42:13.371
She's out for revenge.

42:13.411 --> 42:15.170
She knows we worked together
to get Athif.

42:15.210 --> 42:16.690
'Watch yourself.'

42:16.730 --> 42:18.371
Do you understand?

42:18.411 --> 42:20.011
'OK.'

42:38.850 --> 42:41.411
Hello, hi.
Hiya.

42:41.451 --> 42:43.210
Ta, thanks.
Thank you.

42:56.371 --> 42:57.850
Oi! Oi!

43:04.650 --> 43:06.650
Hell!

43:06.690 --> 43:08.531
Go on, get on.

43:08.571 --> 43:10.491
Don't touch that, mate,
it's evidence.

43:12.571 --> 43:14.730
Yeah, Detective Chief Superintendent
Bancroft.

43:14.770 --> 43:17.051
Urgent assistance required,
Archer Road.

43:17.091 --> 43:19.451
Suspected acid attack.

44:07.891 --> 44:09.650
'Hello, this is Elizabeth Bancroft.

44:09.690 --> 44:12.091
'I'm currently unavailable
to take your call at the moment.

44:12.130 --> 44:13.690
'But if you leave your name
and number,

44:13.730 --> 44:15.371
'I'll endeavour to get back to you.'

44:17.210 --> 44:18.210
Hi, it's me.

44:21.130 --> 44:24.051
I was hoping that I'd catch you,
but, um...

44:28.011 --> 44:31.451
Just so you know,
we'll be back in a couple of days.

44:31.491 --> 44:32.491
We're fine.

44:33.571 --> 44:34.971
That nobody needs to worry.

44:39.170 --> 44:40.491
Bye, Mum.

44:56.025 --> 44:57.706
"We're leaving town
for a couple of days.

44:57.746 --> 44:59.545
"Annabel needs some space, Joe."

44:59.585 --> 45:00.866
You tip them off?

45:00.905 --> 45:02.786
You've been pumping George
for information,

45:02.826 --> 45:04.146
you were at the hotel last night.

45:04.186 --> 45:06.186
Well, what's wrong with them
leaving town anyway?

45:06.226 --> 45:08.226
Unless they're suspects?
If you interfere again,

45:08.266 --> 45:09.706
I'll take it to the Chief Constable.

45:09.746 --> 45:11.706
My son is not a murderer.

45:11.746 --> 45:14.025
You're his mother,
you're not objective. You're wrong.

45:15.905 --> 45:17.226
I know a killer when I see one.

45:20.666 --> 45:22.465
If you're going up a blind alley
towards Joe,

45:22.505 --> 45:23.945
well, you need to know something...

45:25.226 --> 45:26.786
.. I'll do anything to protect him.

45:53.186 --> 45:54.905
Mm, that's pretty.

45:58.025 --> 45:59.746
Oh, just some bit of old rubbish.

45:59.786 --> 46:01.186
Hm.
Had it for years.

46:05.585 --> 46:08.625
Look, I know that it's difficult
to think about...

46:10.786 --> 46:12.306
.. but that night, at the house...

46:13.666 --> 46:15.585
.. why didn't you get out
when you found your dad?

46:15.625 --> 46:16.625
Why did you go upstairs?

46:16.666 --> 46:17.666
Oh...

46:20.625 --> 46:22.105
I think I...

46:23.746 --> 46:25.905
Well, I heard something, Susan,
she called out.

46:27.105 --> 46:29.706
Yeah, but... you said she was
drowned when you found her?

46:30.826 --> 46:33.505
Well, maybe the attacker was still
up there and that's what I heard?

46:33.545 --> 46:34.826
You didn't see anyone?

46:36.905 --> 46:39.545
You have to get your facts straight
before you talk to the police,

46:39.585 --> 46:40.945
you know that?
Of course I do.

46:45.866 --> 46:47.425
The moped was stolen.

46:47.465 --> 46:49.266
It was seen fleeing
the Highwater Estate

46:49.306 --> 46:51.545
30 minutes after the acid attack
on you.

46:51.585 --> 46:53.866
The same driver
stabbed a young man there.

46:53.905 --> 46:55.666
At Highwater?
Mm.

46:55.706 --> 46:58.146
Was-Was it a gang thing?
Seems like it.

46:58.186 --> 47:02.545
And I assume you heard
that girl died overnight?

47:02.585 --> 47:04.186
What girl?

47:04.226 --> 47:06.905
The 16 year old,
hospitalised after taking cocaine.

47:06.945 --> 47:09.786
I do hope this isn't the beginning
of a new drug problem.

47:09.826 --> 47:12.386
The stats have been exceptional
over the last 12 months.

47:12.425 --> 47:13.706
We don't want that changing.

47:13.746 --> 47:16.425
I know, of course, I'll, um,
I'll find out what's going on.

47:16.465 --> 47:18.625
Whatever it is...

47:18.666 --> 47:20.146
come down hard on it.

47:27.465 --> 47:29.065
This Highwater stabbing?

47:29.105 --> 47:31.266
Victim was one of Daanish's men.

47:31.306 --> 47:32.585
It was his corner.

47:32.625 --> 47:34.465
He reckons Mrs Kamara
gave the order.

47:36.226 --> 47:38.465
We've had this drugs thing
under control for two years,

47:38.505 --> 47:40.505
now she comes back
and kicks it all off again.

47:41.505 --> 47:42.985
And that girl who OD'd has died.

47:44.025 --> 47:45.985
She wants a war,
she's gonna get one.

47:46.025 --> 47:47.025
Yeah.

47:50.505 --> 47:52.025
'Hi, it's me...

47:52.065 --> 47:54.826
'I was hoping that I'd catch you,
but, um...

47:54.866 --> 47:59.585
'Just so you know, we'll be back
in a couple of days and we're fine.

47:59.625 --> 48:01.306
'That nobody needs to worry.

48:01.346 --> 48:03.346
'Bye, Mum.'

48:03.386 --> 48:05.666
I'm the last person he'd call
if he had something to hide.

48:05.706 --> 48:07.346
Unless he wants you to help
cover for him?

48:08.425 --> 48:10.226
What about Lucinda Connors' file?

48:10.266 --> 48:12.025
Annabel's mum,
have you looked into that?

48:12.065 --> 48:13.706
Yeah, of course.
And?

48:13.746 --> 48:15.746
It's not relevant
to the present investigation.

48:15.786 --> 48:17.505
Well, are you sure?

48:17.545 --> 48:19.505
One minute your mother's hanging up
a glass lamp,

48:19.545 --> 48:20.945
the next, she's cut her neck open

48:20.985 --> 48:23.146
and she's bleeding out
in front of you. I mean,

48:23.186 --> 48:26.505
that just must have been terrifying
for Annabel. I don't see your point.

48:26.545 --> 48:29.905
Wha... What does that level
of trauma do to a child?

48:30.905 --> 48:33.146
That's the question I'd wanna ask.

48:33.186 --> 48:35.346
You realise if she's implicated,
Joe could be too?

48:35.386 --> 48:37.826
Well, then he'll have to pay
the price, just like anybody else.

48:39.585 --> 48:42.786
Look, this is my force, my patch...

48:42.826 --> 48:45.105
I wanna know who did it,
just as much as you do.

48:45.146 --> 48:46.985
You have no idea where
they might have gone?

48:47.025 --> 48:48.545
No! No, none, I wish I had.

48:48.585 --> 48:51.465
Look, you can monitor my phone,
just in case he calls again.

48:53.505 --> 48:54.505
Yeah, we will. Thanks.

48:56.945 --> 48:59.505
And you're probably right
not to be looking into Annabel,

48:59.545 --> 49:00.905
just keep her in mind, that's all.

49:05.625 --> 49:07.065
We're checking out her flat today,

49:07.105 --> 49:09.105
and a few other properties
Michael Connors owned.

49:14.625 --> 49:17.266
I'm not sure "needing space"
adds up.

49:17.306 --> 49:19.306
Didn't they know
we wanted to keep talking to them?

49:19.346 --> 49:21.706
I specifically asked Annabel
to get Joe to call us.

49:21.746 --> 49:24.505
She said he would. What if she
didn't go with him willingly?

49:24.545 --> 49:26.545
Joe wrote the note...
Ah, come on...

49:26.585 --> 49:29.706
this isn't abduction. We can't rule
out concerns for Annabel's safety.

49:29.746 --> 49:32.786
Still no trace of them?
Mobile phones? CCTV?

49:32.826 --> 49:36.585
ANPR picked up, er,
the car heading west on the A577.

49:36.625 --> 49:39.266
From there, there's nothing.
Must be taking back roads.

49:39.306 --> 49:41.465
Exactly what I'd do
if I made my girlfriend run away

49:41.505 --> 49:43.025
and didn't wanna be found!

49:43.065 --> 49:45.706
Reed, arrange access
to Annabel's flat, drive over there.

49:45.746 --> 49:48.746
Look around for any pointers
to where they might be.

49:48.786 --> 49:50.945
Michael Connors had a hunting lodge
he rented out.

49:50.985 --> 49:52.505
Morris, take a look at it.

49:52.545 --> 49:54.985
We throw everything at this.
It could be an innocent misstep,

49:55.025 --> 49:57.386
or it could be something more.
Thank you.

51:03.186 --> 51:06.746
Michael Connors has a licence
for an AYA twelve-bore shotgun,

51:06.786 --> 51:08.505
and it's definitely missing.

51:08.545 --> 51:10.985
Would Joe and/or Annabel know
where the guns were kept?

51:11.025 --> 51:13.866
Yeah. Michael used to take them
shooting when they visited.

51:15.945 --> 51:18.666
So, we've got Joe, Annabel
and a gun all missing.

51:19.905 --> 51:22.306
Coincidences like that
make me nervous.

51:30.985 --> 51:33.146
Where have you been?
I didn't know where you were!

51:33.186 --> 51:35.585
I just went down to the sea.
Are you OK?!

51:35.625 --> 51:37.746
Yeah, I'm fine, Joe.

51:37.786 --> 51:39.945
Don't go off like that again, OK?
You had me worried.

51:39.985 --> 51:42.146
So, it's all right for you
to sneak off in the night?

51:43.585 --> 51:44.625
Last night.

51:45.866 --> 51:47.585
I saw you, at the phone box.
You followed me?

51:47.625 --> 51:49.425
Who did you call, Joe?
My mum.

51:51.866 --> 51:53.826
Annabel, listen...
Why did you call her?

51:53.866 --> 51:56.266
She can help us! I can't believe
you'd do that behind my back!

51:56.306 --> 51:58.706
You going into that house that night
could look bad for you.

51:58.746 --> 52:01.306
She's high-ranking, she's gonna
know who to talk to, what to do.

52:01.346 --> 52:03.985
You're gonna have to talk to
the police about it at some point.

52:04.025 --> 52:07.306
I- I-I don't have to do anything.
Annabel, we can't stay here forever!

52:07.346 --> 52:09.945
We said we'd be back
in a couple of days.

52:09.985 --> 52:12.146
The police might be getting
suspicious as it is.

52:12.186 --> 52:14.985
I am going through
THE most terrible experience...

52:15.025 --> 52:16.786
and all you're doing
is badgering me,

52:16.826 --> 52:18.226
after all I've done for you!
Yes.

52:18.266 --> 52:19.826
I picked you up
when you were a wreck...

52:19.866 --> 52:22.025
Yes, and now it's my turn
to help you.

52:22.065 --> 52:23.905
I need you to talk to me!

52:25.226 --> 52:29.226
My mum always lied, and she always
held things back from me,

52:29.266 --> 52:30.346
don't be like her.

52:33.585 --> 52:35.826
But if I tell you everything,
I'm scared you'll leave me.

52:35.866 --> 52:37.266
I don't care what you've done,

52:37.306 --> 52:38.905
I just don't want it
coming between us.

52:38.945 --> 52:39.945
It's bad, Joe.

52:42.146 --> 52:44.866
It's really bad.
Nothing can shock me, believe me.

52:52.146 --> 52:54.065
Bancroft wants a big response.

52:54.105 --> 52:55.905
This is what we're gonna do.

52:55.945 --> 52:58.105
We turn over a load
of drug-related names.

52:58.146 --> 53:01.386
Put the message out
that WE are in control.

53:01.425 --> 53:03.706
We put your mum in the mix,
bang her up out of the way.

53:03.746 --> 53:05.706
That won't be enough.

53:05.746 --> 53:06.746
She's dangerous.

53:08.025 --> 53:09.985
Bancroft doesn't get it.

53:10.025 --> 53:11.706
Bancroft just had acid
lobbed at her,

53:11.746 --> 53:13.266
by the same guy
who stabbed your lad.

53:13.306 --> 53:15.545
She gets it!

53:15.585 --> 53:16.905
She's pissed off

53:16.945 --> 53:18.746
and wants her turf back.

53:24.985 --> 53:26.666
I don't believe this.

53:26.706 --> 53:28.065
That's Anil,

53:28.105 --> 53:30.065
he used to work for me.

53:30.105 --> 53:31.226
Remember Anil?

53:32.585 --> 53:34.706
Yeah. Hard to forget.

53:36.105 --> 53:39.025
You will hand over
your entire business to me.

53:40.266 --> 53:41.266
No.

53:43.425 --> 53:45.905
Then I will tell everyone
you're a police grass.

53:45.945 --> 53:47.146
You wouldn't.

53:50.945 --> 53:52.346
You wouldn't wanna lose two sons.

53:58.905 --> 54:00.465
You're not my son.

54:18.505 --> 54:19.905
Is that Naila Kamara?

54:21.425 --> 54:23.625
Thought that family
were a thing of the past.

54:23.666 --> 54:25.025
She's just come back to the UK.

54:26.866 --> 54:29.105
Think she might be involved
in these drugs going around?

54:30.226 --> 54:31.746
It's possible.

54:31.786 --> 54:34.306
Won't hurt to bring her in,
cover our bases.

54:35.866 --> 54:37.826
Whatever happened to that other son,
um...

54:39.186 --> 54:41.425
.. Daanish?

54:41.465 --> 54:42.746
He still inside?

54:42.786 --> 54:45.306
He got out after six months.

54:45.346 --> 54:47.625
Went totally clean.

54:47.666 --> 54:49.146
Hasn't crossed our radar since.

55:08.465 --> 55:11.306
Look, just forget about Walker,
he's leaving soon anyway.

55:11.346 --> 55:13.025
Easy for you to say!

55:13.065 --> 55:16.266
You make sure it's me
getting my hands dirty all the time.

55:16.306 --> 55:17.666
If this all blows up...

55:18.826 --> 55:20.186
.. I won't go down alone.

55:20.226 --> 55:22.985
Look, I cannot deal with this
right now. I'll talk to you later.

55:30.625 --> 55:31.786
Hi.

55:31.826 --> 55:33.386
It's DC Reed, isn't it?

55:33.425 --> 55:35.386
Yes, Ma'am. I wasn't expecting you.

55:35.425 --> 55:37.625
How can I help?
Oh, no, no, no, I'm here to help.

55:37.666 --> 55:40.226
Harper sent me, see if I could spot
anything out of the ordinary,

55:40.266 --> 55:41.746
you know, as Joe's mum...

55:41.786 --> 55:44.666
So, can we just get into the flat...
Sorry.

55:44.706 --> 55:46.306
I had a bit of trouble
finding the keys.

55:46.346 --> 55:48.306
Hi, DCS Bancroft.

55:48.346 --> 55:50.505
Oh, you're Joe's mother.
I- I saw you on TV.

55:50.545 --> 55:52.826
Listen, I'm so sorry
for everything you've been through.

55:54.386 --> 55:56.545
I'm-I'm just trying
to keep myself busy.

55:58.585 --> 55:59.585
Right.

56:05.331 --> 56:06.851
After my mother died...

56:07.891 --> 56:09.291
.. I had terrible nightmares.

56:11.490 --> 56:13.331
Dad let me sleep in his bed.

56:14.731 --> 56:17.090
He'd stroke my hair...

56:17.130 --> 56:18.570
.. any bare skin he could find.

56:18.610 --> 56:20.450
He'd tell me I looked
so much like my mother.

56:23.010 --> 56:24.331
That's when he'd...

56:25.691 --> 56:27.650
.. progress things.

56:27.691 --> 56:30.331
How do you mean... Do I really
have to explain it all blow-by-blow?

56:30.371 --> 56:32.010
No.

56:32.050 --> 56:33.490
No, of course not.

56:35.090 --> 56:37.291
You never told anyone?

56:37.331 --> 56:39.490
Your stepbrothers, or your friends?
No.

56:41.891 --> 56:42.891
I was scared.

56:44.731 --> 56:45.731
Ashamed.

56:47.371 --> 56:49.891
He made me feel so dirty...

56:51.811 --> 56:52.891
This is so fucked up.

56:52.930 --> 56:54.930
The fact is,
he was trying to drive us apart.

56:56.691 --> 56:57.970
So typical of Dad...

56:59.371 --> 57:00.411
.. so controlling.

57:01.450 --> 57:03.930
But being with you
gave me the strength to fight him.

57:06.211 --> 57:08.570
I wanted to make MY choice
for MY life,

57:08.610 --> 57:10.050
and my choice was you, Joe.

57:12.130 --> 57:13.171
So, I went to tell him.

57:15.930 --> 57:17.291
He laughed at me.

57:19.650 --> 57:21.570
Started stroking my hair
like he used to, and...

57:23.010 --> 57:24.610
And I just lost it.

57:24.650 --> 57:26.010
OK. When we go to the police,

57:26.050 --> 57:28.530
you're gonna have to tell them
everything... I can't, I can't.

57:28.570 --> 57:30.970
You could plead manslaughter.
They'd send me to prison.

57:31.010 --> 57:32.331
No, not if you have a good lawyer.

57:32.371 --> 57:34.251
Your father abused you,
your stepmother knew.

57:34.291 --> 57:36.731
You could build a strong case
of mitigating circumstances.

57:36.771 --> 57:38.530
No, I-I'd lose everything.

57:38.570 --> 57:39.650
I'd lose you.

57:39.691 --> 57:42.731
No. No. You will never lose me.

57:43.891 --> 57:45.731
I'll never leave you,
do you understand?

57:53.050 --> 57:54.050
I trust you.

57:56.530 --> 57:57.771
I'll do whatever you think.

57:58.731 --> 58:00.211
Go back...

58:00.251 --> 58:01.331
talk to the police.

58:03.771 --> 58:05.610
But can we just have
a bit more time?

58:07.650 --> 58:09.010
Just the two of us?

58:10.251 --> 58:11.970
Just for a day.

58:21.130 --> 58:22.331
I best get on.

58:22.371 --> 58:24.530
Well, unless you need me
to stick around for anything?

58:24.570 --> 58:26.530
No. No, no, no, you go.

58:26.570 --> 58:27.771
Take care of yourself.

58:33.691 --> 58:36.130
If I was living in a place
rent-free, I'd look after it better.

58:37.411 --> 58:38.411
This isn't Joe.

58:41.050 --> 58:43.251
He used to tidy up after me
when we lived at home.

58:44.610 --> 58:46.050
Have a look around, Ma'am.

58:46.090 --> 58:48.010
See anything unusual, let me know.

59:05.570 --> 59:07.251
'I've found something.'

59:07.291 --> 59:09.930
Size eight, male trainer.
It could be a match for

59:09.970 --> 59:12.211
the crime scene footprint.
Could be Joe Bancroft's.

59:13.530 --> 59:15.970
I'm sorry,
but you can't go round there, Ma'am.

59:16.010 --> 59:17.891
This place is now a crime scene.

59:17.930 --> 59:19.411
I need you out!
