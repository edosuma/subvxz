00:50.750 --> 00:52.809
Bitch.

01:26.853 --> 01:30.311
Bartender, seven and seven, pack of Morleys.

01:39.299 --> 01:43.030
Seven and seven, pack of Morleys.

01:44.037 --> 01:46.130
We have a winner.

01:48.575 --> 01:51.305
Do l know you?

01:51.377 --> 01:53.504
Do you know me?

01:53.580 --> 01:57.516
Come on, Wayne-o.
l'm part of the regular game.

01:58.751 --> 02:02.744
You know your problem, my friend?
lt's not the cards.

02:02.856 --> 02:06.019
lt's playing the hand you were dealt.

02:06.092 --> 02:10.995
Plenty of guys get a bad deal.
lt's all in what you do with it.

02:11.064 --> 02:14.090
You know what l'm saying, partner?

02:15.535 --> 02:17.662
You can think. Cards can't.

02:17.737 --> 02:22.197
They just lie there.
You gotta make them work for ya.

02:23.209 --> 02:25.006
Jack of hearts.

02:30.850 --> 02:36.948
2,598,960 possible five-card hands,

02:37.056 --> 02:40.719
1277 flushes in any given suit,

02:40.793 --> 02:44.957
1,980,240 ways to make two pairs,

02:45.064 --> 02:49.899
and yet the game can't beat the man.

02:49.969 --> 02:53.234
Man only beats himself.

02:53.306 --> 02:57.299
And so on and so forth.

03:04.250 --> 03:10.052
She comes here every Friday,
loses her paycheck, cries all weekend.

03:10.123 --> 03:12.216
Such a nice girl.

03:13.226 --> 03:18.926
l keep hoping her luck is gonna change
and she could catch a break.

03:24.971 --> 03:28.930
We gonna blow this joint?
Call it a night?

03:30.843 --> 03:35.075
Hey, Wayne-o, you're bluffing me, right?

03:35.915 --> 03:38.145
You're gonna show me Fifth Street.

03:38.251 --> 03:42.688
Walk right outta here, surprise me.
For a change.

04:08.281 --> 04:10.374
Three of hearts.

04:11.684 --> 04:14.653
Two of clubs.

04:16.389 --> 04:18.822
l won! l won!

04:20.526 --> 04:23.552
Oh, my God! Help me, please!

04:23.663 --> 04:25.358
Help me!

04:25.465 --> 04:29.162
Somebody help me.
There's a woman who's been murdered.

04:29.235 --> 04:32.636
Somebody help me. Oh, God!

06:27.420 --> 06:30.253
Agent Reyes?

06:30.323 --> 06:33.815
Three plus four is seven.
Seven and six are 13.

06:34.927 --> 06:39.626
- What are you doing?
- 10. 13. 14. 16.

06:40.600 --> 06:44.593
l wanna ask you to open your mind
to something. Don't think l'm crazy.

06:44.670 --> 06:46.797
Why would l think that you're crazy?

06:46.873 --> 06:52.175
Do you believe the universe is knowable
as a mathematical calculation of the whole?

06:52.278 --> 06:54.508
- No.
- Why not?

06:54.614 --> 06:58.641
Because its complexity doesn't allow
for it to be reduced so simply.

06:58.718 --> 07:01.152
But you accept that some people do?

07:01.220 --> 07:04.018
l presume you mean
the so-called unified theory,

07:04.123 --> 07:06.819
what physicists refer to
as the theory of everything -

07:06.893 --> 07:11.227
an equation so simple they say
that it might be printed on a T-shirt.

07:11.330 --> 07:13.890
lt's a holy grail in the world of science,

07:14.000 --> 07:18.164
potentially the most important question
that mankind has ever asked.

07:18.237 --> 07:25.473
But that such a complex calculation is even
possible is a subject of great controversy.

07:25.545 --> 07:28.742
ls that what you mean?

07:28.848 --> 07:31.544
Um... potentially.

07:35.688 --> 07:39.055
Carla Maria Carpenter.
Born 2-1-77.

07:39.158 --> 07:44.357
Killed outside a nightclub two years ago.
Her murder remains unsolved.

07:47.099 --> 07:50.865
Judy Ann Fuller.
Born 3-21-69.

07:50.937 --> 07:53.735
Killed at a mall two years ago. Unsolved.

07:57.910 --> 08:01.869
Julie Frances Gresham.
Born 1-22-80.

08:01.948 --> 08:06.282
Killed in her parked car last month.
Unsolved.

08:06.385 --> 08:12.187
Agent Reyes, if there's a connection that
l'm supposed to be seeing, l'm not seeing it.

08:12.258 --> 08:14.089
And our latest victim.

08:14.193 --> 08:18.459
Amy Sheridan Noffsberger.
Born 4-4-77.

08:18.564 --> 08:23.058
Killed two weeks ago in a casino.
Police have yet to find her killer.

08:23.135 --> 08:26.901
Am l to presume that you've solved
these unsolved murders

08:26.973 --> 08:29.533
by using some kind of numerical calculation?

08:29.609 --> 08:32.578
Letters of names assigned values,
added to birth dates,

08:32.645 --> 08:35.044
reduced to the lowest common denominator.

08:35.114 --> 08:37.912
A-J-S equal one. B-K-T...

08:37.984 --> 08:41.750
Numerology, Agent Reyes.

08:41.821 --> 08:47.282
You're trying to solve these cases
by using what is essentially a child's game.

08:47.393 --> 08:49.452
lt's been used since the 6th century BC,

08:49.562 --> 08:53.555
when Pythagoras determined that the world
was built on the power of numbers.

08:53.633 --> 08:56.932
And when exactly did you stumble upon it?

08:57.003 --> 08:59.494
We did it as kids.

08:59.605 --> 09:04.508
l still do it. You meet people at a party,
ask them their birth date. lt's an icebreaker.

09:04.610 --> 09:08.239
As l was reading the story of this woman,
l calculated she was a 14 -

09:08.314 --> 09:12.307
what they call a karmic number,
a significant numerological number -

09:12.418 --> 09:15.148
prompting me to look at
these other unsolved cases,

09:15.254 --> 09:21.659
the victims of which also work out
to have karmic numbers: 10, 13, 16.

09:21.761 --> 09:25.754
So in other words
you haven't actually solved these cases.

09:25.831 --> 09:27.799
''Cracked'' is a better word.

09:27.867 --> 09:34.466
Without any other evidence to directly
connect them, circumstantial or forensic?

09:36.943 --> 09:38.535
What?

09:43.649 --> 09:45.378
Can you enlarge this?

09:55.294 --> 09:59.060
Can l see the rest of those photos?

09:59.165 --> 10:01.656
What is it?

10:01.734 --> 10:04.498
There's a pattern in the bruising.

10:04.570 --> 10:06.037
Yeah.

10:06.138 --> 10:08.663
All four of the victims have it.

10:08.741 --> 10:13.178
Three small circles.
lt might be from a ring that the killer wears.

10:14.981 --> 10:17.313
You're saying these cases are connected.

10:17.383 --> 10:22.411
That numerology may actually be driving
the killer and that l'm definitely not crazy.

10:22.521 --> 10:25.649
Or that maybe you're both crazy.

12:25.711 --> 12:27.178
Arrivederci.

12:31.984 --> 12:33.451
Wayne-o.

12:33.519 --> 12:35.384
Come stai?

12:35.488 --> 12:39.151
Quit following me or
you might find yourself dead real soon.

12:39.225 --> 12:41.557
Oh, come on, Wayne-o.

12:41.660 --> 12:46.154
That's not your style.
Doesn't fit your pattern.

12:46.665 --> 12:51.364
Far be it from me to rat you out.
Can't show 'em what they can't see.

12:52.705 --> 12:55.697
Now, two clowns and a man with a crown.

12:55.808 --> 12:58.208
Want to try your luck, sailor?

12:58.844 --> 13:03.838
King runs, but he can't hide.
How can you lose? Kids' stuff.

13:08.020 --> 13:12.354
There goes the neighborhood.
But Mr Money lives right next door.

13:13.559 --> 13:19.759
There's a secret to this game, Wayne-o,
and l'm gonna tell you what the secret is.

13:20.432 --> 13:22.923
Choose better.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.941
You got something to say to me, you say it.

13:32.378 --> 13:34.403
Son, l just did.

14:16.222 --> 14:17.246
Hello?

14:17.323 --> 14:21.054
There's a clipboard there with three forms.
Fill out the top one.

14:21.126 --> 14:26.393
Or all three if you wanna unlock your secret
numbers for love, life and true happiness.

14:26.465 --> 14:30.265
l'm not here for a personal chart.
l'm with the FBl,

14:30.336 --> 14:35.069
investigating a series of deaths that
seem to have a numerological connection.

14:35.140 --> 14:39.099
l give insights to the living.
The dead already know their future.

14:39.178 --> 14:41.976
These are murders.
l want your help in solving them.

14:42.081 --> 14:44.948
You may overestimate
the work l'm capable of.

14:45.017 --> 14:49.954
My hope is, in doing the victims' numerology,
you'll be able to draw a picture of the killer.

14:50.022 --> 14:53.458
l don't think you understand.
l run a little business here.

14:53.525 --> 14:58.861
People come here if they wanna improve their
lives, get rich, marry the man of their dreams.

14:58.964 --> 15:03.594
Look around. lf l could actually provide
that kind of information...

15:03.669 --> 15:05.796
l don't have to draw you a picture.

15:05.871 --> 15:08.863
- You don't believe in it.
- At best, it's an art.

15:12.778 --> 15:18.182
l have established a numerological
connection between all of these victims.

15:22.021 --> 15:26.481
lf l found the killer,
l might prevent this happening again.

15:28.027 --> 15:30.154
Let me see what l can come up with.

15:34.800 --> 15:38.292
- Monica Reyes.
- Monica, you're not gonna believe this.

15:38.370 --> 15:42.306
We found two more cases,
two more victims to add to this thing.

15:42.374 --> 15:44.569
Both with the same marks on their faces.

15:44.677 --> 15:49.478
l knew you were good, but this?
This is career-launching.

15:49.548 --> 15:53.006
You better get back here.

16:04.263 --> 16:05.855
Nice work.

16:06.665 --> 16:08.826
Well done. Well done.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.027
Thank you.

16:10.102 --> 16:12.070
By tying these cases together,

16:12.171 --> 16:18.007
VlCAP is now developing a profile on the man
we are officially calling the Triple Zero Killer.

16:18.077 --> 16:20.841
Through the identification
of the pattern he leaves,

16:20.913 --> 16:25.577
we have connected six unsolved cases to
one murderer, including these two new cases.

16:25.684 --> 16:29.381
Agent Scully will act as
a point person on the case forensics.

16:29.455 --> 16:31.855
Three recent killings and three from 1999.

16:31.924 --> 16:37.920
The pattern appears to be murders in threes
on a serpentine trail up the Eastern seaboard.

16:38.030 --> 16:42.228
Agent Doggett will lead the task force.
Here's what we don't know.

16:42.301 --> 16:45.236
One: how he chooses his victims.
Two: how he kills.

16:45.304 --> 16:48.603
Three: if he'll kill again soon
or disappear like two years ago.

16:48.707 --> 16:52.609
He may have been incarcerated. We may
be looking for someone with a record.

16:52.711 --> 16:54.440
Excellent observation.

16:54.546 --> 16:58.277
The killer is strong.
He uses his fists as weapons.

16:58.384 --> 17:02.718
Brute force.
He is angry and he acts on impulse.

17:02.788 --> 17:05.279
Good. lmportant.

17:05.391 --> 17:10.657
Agent Reyes, we're all working off your lead.
Give us your special insight into this case.

17:11.829 --> 17:16.061
Well, the killer probably has
a soul number of either four or six.

17:16.135 --> 17:20.070
His birth path is - l'm guessing -
a nine or maybe a six.

17:20.138 --> 17:23.438
The destiny and
realization numbers are karmic.

17:23.509 --> 17:26.967
l'll know for sure once l've got
the charts from the numerologist,

17:27.079 --> 17:32.278
but the killer is probably working off
numerical vibrational disharmonies.

17:33.585 --> 17:35.348
That's her now.

17:35.454 --> 17:37.251
- Monica Reyes.
- Agent Reyes?

17:37.322 --> 17:40.314
- l've been running numbers on the victims.
- Yes?

17:40.426 --> 17:44.260
- And the strangest thing has come up.
- What? What is it?

17:44.329 --> 17:50.598
There's three forms in the clipboard. Fill in
the top one, or all three if you wanna unlock...

18:03.382 --> 18:07.375
l want her body sent to Quantico.
l want facts. l want details.

18:07.486 --> 18:10.978
l want Agent Scully to go over this woman
with a fine-tooth comb.

18:11.457 --> 18:14.449
And l want you to tell me
who else knows about this.

18:14.526 --> 18:16.221
- About what?
- This case.

18:16.328 --> 18:19.126
About you coming to this office
to see this woman.

18:19.198 --> 18:21.462
l don't think l told anyone.

18:21.533 --> 18:25.230
Then how did the killer find his way here?
Chance? Coincidence?

18:25.337 --> 18:26.531
l...

18:26.638 --> 18:30.506
We got a guy working the Eastern seaboard,
murdering along the coast.

18:30.576 --> 18:34.637
Tell me how he winds up here,
in this building, on this floor, in this room,

18:34.713 --> 18:37.546
on the same day you came to see her
if he didn't know.

18:37.649 --> 18:39.913
That's why l came to see this woman:

18:40.018 --> 18:43.215
to find out who the killer is,
why he does what he does.

18:43.322 --> 18:47.588
We have a reputation to uphold.
The FBl doesn't go to numerologists

18:47.693 --> 18:53.063
for the same reason we don't consult
horoscopes or palm readers or crystal balls.

18:53.165 --> 18:58.102
A killer kills for a reason. He lives in
the world of cause and effect, as we all do.

18:58.203 --> 19:02.697
He gets an impulse and acts on it.
Always the case, even if he doesn't know it.

19:02.774 --> 19:05.038
And that's how we catch him.

19:05.110 --> 19:09.843
lf he acts on impulses he can't understand,
isn't it possible we can't understand them?

19:09.915 --> 19:13.544
Can we not accept that every killer
is not driven by the same impulses?

19:13.619 --> 19:16.884
That there are impulses
that not every killer kills for?

19:16.955 --> 19:18.445
No.

19:18.557 --> 19:20.855
- Why not?
- Because it's unacceptable.

19:20.926 --> 19:23.520
But if Reyes didn't tell anyone
she was coming,

19:23.595 --> 19:27.224
the only person who could have any idea
is somebody at the FBl.

19:27.299 --> 19:29.699
An inside job? l don't buy it.

19:29.768 --> 19:33.704
- Don't we have to accept it as a possibility?
- No, we don't.

19:33.772 --> 19:37.606
- Why?
- Because it's highly improbable.

19:37.709 --> 19:41.645
- But not impossible.
- Six of one, half a dozen of the other.

19:41.747 --> 19:46.309
- How would you like us to proceed, sir?
- The bottom line is, l want results.

19:46.418 --> 19:50.582
l don't care how you go about it.
What l want is this killer caught.

19:50.656 --> 19:54.285
All right, let's get the body outta here.

19:55.160 --> 19:57.788
- Maybe you were followed.
- How?

19:57.896 --> 20:01.457
lf the killer didn't even know
l was looking for him?

20:01.567 --> 20:03.159
You explain it, then.

20:03.268 --> 20:06.965
This woman called me
just before she was murdered.

20:07.072 --> 20:10.405
She had something to tell me,
something in the victims' charts.

20:10.475 --> 20:13.308
- Their charts?
- Their numerology.

20:13.412 --> 20:17.473
A calculation of numbers
that rule their lives in 13 categories.

20:17.583 --> 20:21.576
- But a calculation based on what?
- On names and birth dates.

20:21.653 --> 20:27.091
Because my name is John J Doggett and l
was born April 4, 1960, l got a magic number?

20:27.826 --> 20:31.990
Six. Which makes you
an active, adaptive, curious person,

20:32.097 --> 20:36.193
who insists on their independence,
loves a bargain, and wants to be successful.

20:36.301 --> 20:39.793
- That describes pretty much anyone.
- People are people.

20:39.871 --> 20:43.705
- Right. They're not numbers.
- Then what was she calling me for?

20:49.181 --> 20:53.709
l'm gonna leave you here to figure that out.
l'm going back to the Bureau.

21:18.410 --> 21:21.811
- Buongiorno, Wayne-o.
- Who do you think you are?

21:21.880 --> 21:24.007
Who do you think l am?

21:33.025 --> 21:36.426
- Don't say a word.
- Do l ever?

21:52.444 --> 21:55.902
You're just trying to get me caught.

21:56.014 --> 21:58.710
l'm just playing a game of dominoes.

21:58.784 --> 22:02.220
Long as you're sitting here, though,
how are you feeling?

22:03.221 --> 22:06.213
- Go to hell.
- Are the reservations in your name?

22:08.427 --> 22:12.557
You're a card.
You really are a card.

22:12.631 --> 22:14.462
But l love you.

22:16.368 --> 22:20.134
- Got time for a quick game?
- l don't play your games.

22:21.707 --> 22:24.608
Not a truer word's been spoken.

22:54.940 --> 22:58.467
The deceased is Vicki Louise Burdick.

22:58.577 --> 23:03.640
Upon external examination, cause of death
appears to be a fatal blow to the maxilla,

23:03.749 --> 23:08.243
in which a small three-ring pattern lies.

23:09.154 --> 23:15.150
l will begin
my internal examination at 6:06pm.

24:14.219 --> 24:16.414
Agent Scully.

24:16.521 --> 24:19.581
- l've got something to show you.
- What is it?

24:19.691 --> 24:23.388
l figured out what the triple-zero pattern
on the victim is.

24:23.495 --> 24:29.434
They aren't zeroes at all.
lt's the number 666, only worn away.

24:29.534 --> 24:34.062
lt must be stamped on the killer's ring.
666 - the mark of the devil.

24:34.172 --> 24:36.936
Of course. How'd you figure that?

24:37.042 --> 24:40.034
- l didn't.
- Then how'd you discover it?

24:40.111 --> 24:42.773
Completely by accident.

24:42.881 --> 24:47.045
l discovered something. The victims' charts,
when the numbers were figured,

24:47.118 --> 24:51.714
the numerologist found
they were a match to her own numbers.

24:51.790 --> 24:55.954
- How did the killer find her?
- lt obviously wasn't an accident.

24:57.863 --> 25:01.355
And how does that help us find the killer?

25:01.433 --> 25:03.924
lt doesn't.

25:22.287 --> 25:27.884
Agent Doggett, l think we have
a psychological profile on the murderer.

25:28.393 --> 25:31.453
- What is it?
- Based on the amalgam of forensic detail,

25:31.563 --> 25:35.727
the facts, such as time and place
of the murders and the amount of force,

25:35.800 --> 25:40.294
the killer is a man in his mid-twenties
to late-forties, average build and looks,

25:40.405 --> 25:44.239
who is driven by rage
stemming from a hatred of his mother.

25:44.309 --> 25:46.971
He was a bed-wetter
who was made to feel inferior,

25:47.078 --> 25:51.071
which he took out on the world
by killing small animals.

25:51.149 --> 25:53.982
- That's it?
- Go to work.

25:54.085 --> 25:59.421
That's the average profile of almost every
single serial killer the FBl's ever hunted.

25:59.491 --> 26:02.619
ls that really all that surprising?

26:04.863 --> 26:07.093
ls there a problem, Agent Doggett?

26:09.834 --> 26:13.167
lt's the way Agent Reyes found the cases.

26:13.271 --> 26:17.469
l don't think she should
so easily be dismissed.

26:17.542 --> 26:20.670
You don't believe in this nonsense?

26:25.850 --> 26:31.789
Look at this.
The path of the killer forms the number six.

26:31.856 --> 26:36.293
- Your point?
- l don't know. l just noticed it.

26:36.361 --> 26:40.161
Have you noticed
all babies look like Winston Churchill?

26:40.231 --> 26:43.166
Same difference, Agent Doggett.

26:43.868 --> 26:46.632
But what if this is the killer's pattern?

26:46.705 --> 26:51.733
What if the number six has
some kind of significance to the murders?

26:51.843 --> 26:57.748
lt may... to you and Agent Reyes,
but not to victim number seven.

27:12.030 --> 27:15.898
lf we could analyze these numbers,
l know we could figure this out.

27:16.001 --> 27:21.166
Despite what we know about
the victims' numerology, about the ring,

27:21.239 --> 27:27.041
we really know next to nothing about
where to start looking for this man.

27:27.112 --> 27:29.205
The answer's gonna come to me.

27:31.583 --> 27:33.881
You going down?

27:57.208 --> 27:58.732
Thank you.

28:07.452 --> 28:10.478
Get outta the elevator! Move!

28:11.322 --> 28:13.722
Just be cool. Be cool.

28:13.792 --> 28:17.319
All right? Everything's gonna be fine.

28:19.330 --> 28:21.423
Be cool.

28:25.136 --> 28:27.627
- lt's him.
- He's going down.

28:29.974 --> 28:31.839
Stairs.

29:03.174 --> 29:05.267
Not getting reception.

29:06.611 --> 29:08.670
Oh, great!

29:10.014 --> 29:12.107
No service.

29:16.454 --> 29:20.117
We have to get an APB out on that car.
Did you happen to see a plate?

29:20.191 --> 29:21.522
No.

29:23.628 --> 29:27.826
We've got all the numbers on this case
except for the ones we need.

29:27.899 --> 29:31.528
Maybe there's another way out.

29:31.636 --> 29:35.800
lt's only midnight. There's gotta be
somebody coming in or out soon.

29:35.874 --> 29:38.741
How do we know who was driving that car?

29:38.843 --> 29:42.540
That it was even him?
That the killer's not still here?

29:59.831 --> 30:03.494
We are federal agents and we're armed!

30:03.568 --> 30:07.265
lf you are here and
you make any sudden moves,

30:07.372 --> 30:10.933
we will be forced to consider you a threat.

30:14.179 --> 30:16.238
Stay where you are! Right there!

30:18.116 --> 30:22.018
Hands where we can see them!

30:22.086 --> 30:24.884
Get out of the car slowly.

30:36.034 --> 30:40.698
- Did l do something wrong?
- Step around the back of the car.

30:48.112 --> 30:50.603
l want you to show us some identification.

30:50.715 --> 30:53.912
- l don't have a wallet.
- Do you have some form of lD?

30:53.985 --> 30:57.386
- l don't think so.
- Sir, what are you doing here?

30:57.455 --> 31:01.949
- Waiting for a friend.
- At midnight, in a parking garage?

31:02.427 --> 31:05.726
We have this regular game we play.

31:05.797 --> 31:09.597
- What kind of game?
- Checkers.

31:10.668 --> 31:15.435
The checkers are in the trunk,
if either of you play.

31:15.506 --> 31:19.135
Sir, does it look like
we're here to play checkers?

31:19.244 --> 31:22.577
No. What are you here for?

31:22.647 --> 31:26.105
Get your hands back up in the air!
Step forward.

31:28.019 --> 31:30.613
Put your hands on the trunk.

31:38.997 --> 31:40.487
He's clean.

31:40.598 --> 31:44.159
All right. Let's pop the trunk.

31:49.974 --> 31:52.169
- What's all this?
- Music.

31:52.277 --> 31:55.838
- You must really like music.
- l love it. The classics, of course.

31:55.947 --> 31:57.812
Mozart, Bach.

31:57.882 --> 32:02.342
The earlierjazz, Louis Armstrong,
Sinatra, doo-wop, Elvis, marching bands...

32:02.453 --> 32:04.819
Sir, enough.

32:04.889 --> 32:11.055
Don't get me wrong - l love all music,
but l prefer the stuff that lasts.

32:13.731 --> 32:16.666
You like them? Keep 'em.

32:16.734 --> 32:21.034
Thanks to the wondrous world of digital
technology, l can always make more.

32:21.139 --> 32:25.166
What time is your friend coming?

32:25.243 --> 32:28.337
Soon.

32:28.413 --> 32:33.077
- What do you wanna do?
- l don't know. l don't know.

32:33.985 --> 32:35.885
l have some nice dance music.

32:35.987 --> 32:39.889
We happen to be here
because there is a serial killer on the loose.

32:39.991 --> 32:43.893
- How many did he kill?
- Seven women now.

32:45.697 --> 32:49.155
- How are you gonna catch him?
- We're not, stuck down here.

32:49.434 --> 32:53.200
You sure there's nothing l can do?

32:53.271 --> 32:56.365
- Do you have the combination to the door?
- No.

32:56.441 --> 32:58.909
Do you have a cellphone that works?

32:59.010 --> 33:01.945
l wish l did.

33:03.114 --> 33:05.878
There's always checkers.

33:15.226 --> 33:17.786
Next victim?

33:25.903 --> 33:29.031
How did we get ourselves into this?

34:23.127 --> 34:25.186
Agent Reyes?

34:30.034 --> 34:32.127
Your hair color.

34:36.974 --> 34:38.668
l don't believe it.

34:39.543 --> 34:43.139
- What?
- What if we're his next victims?

34:43.214 --> 34:44.511
You?

34:44.581 --> 34:48.279
- The seventh victim was a blonde.
- But neither of you are blondes.

34:48.351 --> 34:50.342
He kills in threes.

34:50.455 --> 34:52.980
Blonde, redhead, brunette.

34:53.056 --> 34:56.652
The next victims will be
a redhead and a brunette.

34:56.726 --> 34:59.821
Amazing! From a game of checkers.

35:03.367 --> 35:05.460
Who are you?

35:05.536 --> 35:09.131
Obviously someone you are
very lucky to have run into.

35:09.207 --> 35:12.233
No. No.

35:12.343 --> 35:15.005
- You're part of this.
- How do you figure that?

35:15.079 --> 35:18.048
No. lt's all in the numbers.

35:18.149 --> 35:22.711
lt makes perfect sense. The numbers led us
to the killer. The killer led us to the garage.

35:22.820 --> 35:27.655
And now all we've done is recognize
the killer's real serial pattern.

35:27.725 --> 35:31.889
- So l didn't have anything to do with it.
- Hey, keep your hands up.

35:31.996 --> 35:33.861
Why?

35:34.932 --> 35:37.230
l don't know.

35:38.536 --> 35:40.697
- What's this about numbers?
- Will you...

35:40.771 --> 35:42.068
l'm good with numbers.

35:42.173 --> 35:45.336
The killer is driven by
an impulse we believe is numerological.

35:45.409 --> 35:50.369
- Of course, he's a serial killer.
- No, that's not what she means.

35:50.848 --> 35:56.047
She thinks that his acts
are determined by a calculation of numbers.

35:56.120 --> 36:00.250
So the killer's not in control of his actions,
the numbers are?

36:00.358 --> 36:01.689
Yes.

36:01.759 --> 36:06.958
Are the numbers helping you catch him
or are they helping him not get caught?

36:07.064 --> 36:10.056
That's a good question.

36:10.635 --> 36:14.901
- So, it's a kind of a game.
- No, it's not.

36:14.972 --> 36:19.238
No, maybe it is. Maybe that's what
this is about - who wins the game.

36:19.310 --> 36:22.302
- l think she's on to something.
- Agent Reyes,

36:22.413 --> 36:27.282
you can't reduce complex factors,
physical and psychological, into a game.

36:27.385 --> 36:32.755
You're a scientist, your world is ruled
by numbers - atoms, molecules, periodicity.

36:32.823 --> 36:36.589
So mightn't everything made from them
be ruled by numbers too?

36:36.661 --> 36:40.995
- Genes, chromosomes, us, the universe.
- Go, girl.

36:41.098 --> 36:44.261
Agent Reyes, that is utter nonsense, OK?

36:44.335 --> 36:47.463
lt would mean that
we are just checkers on a checkerboard

36:47.572 --> 36:52.134
being moved around by some forces
completely outside and unbeknownst to us.

36:52.243 --> 36:54.438
- What did Einstein say?
- There's a winner.

36:54.512 --> 36:56.946
''God does not play dice with the universe.''

36:57.014 --> 37:00.609
Nor does he play checkers.

37:01.252 --> 37:05.450
Look, Agent Reyes,
you can't reduce all of life, all creation,

37:05.523 --> 37:11.155
every piece of art, architecture, music,
literature into a game of win or lose.

37:11.262 --> 37:15.164
Why not? Maybe the winners
are those who play the game better.

37:15.266 --> 37:18.702
Those who see the patterns
and connections, like us right now.

37:18.803 --> 37:21.499
Free will.

37:22.473 --> 37:25.033
Maybe we're not the next victims.

37:25.142 --> 37:30.546
Maybe we're here because we saw the
numbers and we're here to catch the killer.

37:31.682 --> 37:36.381
But the killer is outside, killing,
and we are stuck in a parking garage.

37:37.622 --> 37:40.113
What if he's not?

37:41.058 --> 37:44.459
What if we didn't look hard enough?

37:44.528 --> 37:47.725
What if the killer's still down here?

37:53.371 --> 37:55.669
What are you looking at?

37:57.541 --> 37:59.509
Same thing you are.

38:02.046 --> 38:06.210
- So what now?
- You go left, l'll go right.

38:06.317 --> 38:09.684
You, you stay right where you are.

38:09.754 --> 38:13.554
Oh, there's no getting rid of me.

39:08.079 --> 39:10.206
He's going fast.

39:10.281 --> 39:13.409
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. l think so.

39:13.484 --> 39:16.715
Can you hear me?

39:19.156 --> 39:21.989
Why'd you do it, kill those women?

39:38.242 --> 39:40.107
How did you ever find us?

39:40.177 --> 39:45.171
l saw something in his pattern made me
realize there was gonna be nine victims,

39:45.282 --> 39:49.241
and that maybe you two
were gonna be eight and nine.

40:00.831 --> 40:02.924
Where'd he go?

41:25.416 --> 41:27.281
Hello?

41:27.384 --> 41:30.080
- All right. l need to know.
- What?

41:30.187 --> 41:34.248
What my numerology is... my number...
Whatever you call it. What am l?

41:34.358 --> 41:36.349
You're a nine.

41:36.427 --> 41:38.258
Which means what?

41:38.362 --> 41:40.125
Nine is completion.

41:40.231 --> 41:43.928
You've evolved through all the other numbers
to a spiritual realization

41:44.034 --> 41:47.970
that this life is only part of a larger whole.

41:49.440 --> 41:52.307
Dana, are you there?

41:52.409 --> 41:57.711
- There's something else that's bugging me.
- What's that?

41:57.781 --> 42:00.443
Who was that man?

42:00.551 --> 42:02.985
God knows.
