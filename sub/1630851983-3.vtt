00:36.912 --> 00:39.790
<i>Snoopy, I see you're admiring our robots.</i>

00:41.708 --> 00:45.087
<i>Robots are important tools
for space exploration</i>

00:45.170 --> 00:48.257
<i>because they can do things
and go places that humans can't.</i>

00:50.467 --> 00:53.762
<i>They come in all shapes,
sizes and abilities.</i>

00:53.846 --> 00:58.016
<i>They can even be teamed up to accomplish
some incredibly complicated tasks.</i>

00:58.100 --> 01:01.895
<i>Like working together to collect
and return samples from Mars.</i>
<i>Like working together to collect
and return samples from Mars.</i>

01:02.479 --> 01:06.316
Wow! These bots
sure have some impressive skills.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.361
Okay, let's go. Eye on the ball.

01:09.444 --> 01:12.906
I don't think that's what
they're supposed to be used for, sir.

01:19.288 --> 01:20.581
I stand corrected.

01:20.664 --> 01:24.418
Careful. It's only a matter of time
until the robots take over.

01:24.501 --> 01:25.794
We've all seen the movie.

01:26.420 --> 01:30.132
We really ought to expand
your arts and entertainment options.

01:31.049 --> 01:33.635
<i>Before they help us
search for life in space,</i>

01:33.719 --> 01:36.930
<i>all of NASA's robots
must be thoroughly tested.</i>

01:37.014 --> 01:40.100
And the ones that pass their tests
get to go on the mission?

01:40.184 --> 01:41.643
<i>In a way, yeah.</i>

01:47.983 --> 01:51.278
<i>Thanks, Linus.
Welcome to the testing site.</i>

01:52.112 --> 01:53.113
Neat!

01:53.197 --> 01:56.283
Hey. Where's Snoopy?
He wouldn't want to miss this.

02:03.165 --> 02:07.669
Snoopy, I hate to break it to you,
but your costume's not very convincing.

02:07.753 --> 02:11.840
Do you really believe that's going to
fool CARA into thinking you're a robot

02:11.924 --> 02:13.509
and sending you on a mission?

02:16.887 --> 02:19.139
<i>The first task: digging.</i>

02:19.223 --> 02:23.727
<i>Rovers like</i> <i>Perseverance collect dirt
and rocks for scientists to study.</i>

02:23.810 --> 02:27.773
<i>In this material, we might find
the chemical building blocks of life,</i>

02:27.856 --> 02:30.234
<i>which are the ingredients
that make up you and me.</i>

02:31.151 --> 02:33.153
<i>Well, maybe not me.</i>

03:15.571 --> 03:17.322
<i>Next up: climbing.</i>

03:17.406 --> 03:18.407
Wow.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.367
Interesting.

03:20.450 --> 03:25.956
RoboSimian<i> is a prototype, which means
our engineers are still working on it.</i>

03:26.039 --> 03:31.086
<i>But it's designed to cross the rough and
unpredictable terrain of rocky planets.</i>

04:03.827 --> 04:06.371
<i>And finally: flying.</i>

04:06.455 --> 04:11.084
<i>Designed to be the first powered aircraft
to ever fly on another planet,</i>

04:11.168 --> 04:13.086
<i>Ingenuity</i> <i>is a special helicopter</i>

04:13.170 --> 04:16.298
<i>that'll help us learn
what it takes to fly on Mars.</i>

04:16.380 --> 04:20.427
<i>Later versions might give us a better
understanding of the surface of Mars</i>

04:20.511 --> 04:23.722
<i>and even collect samples
that rovers can't reach.</i>

05:00.467 --> 05:02.928
<i>Excellent! Testing is complete.</i>

05:03.929 --> 05:06.640
<i>This group of robots
has performed optimally</i>

05:06.723 --> 05:10.561
<i>and will soon launch
on NASA missions searching for life.</i>

05:11.979 --> 05:12.980
All of them?

05:15.983 --> 05:19.778
<i>Well, except for the one that's
clearly Snoopy in a robot costume.</i>

05:23.282 --> 05:25.492
<i>I do enjoy his practical jokes.</i>

05:25.576 --> 05:27.911
<i>He's got quite the imagination.</i>

05:33.250 --> 05:36.628
<i>I appreciate your enthusiasm,
Astronaut Snoopy.</i>

05:36.712 --> 05:40.841
<i>At the moment there's just no way
that's realistic or safe</i>

05:40.924 --> 05:43.677
<i>for anyone to travel such long distances.</i>

05:45.888 --> 05:49.933
I guess if Snoopy's not going on
a mission, we won't be needed either.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.477
<i>Not so fast, Franklin.</i>

05:52.561 --> 05:57.107
<i>People, and beagles, may not be able
to go everywhere robots can,</i>

05:57.191 --> 06:00.903
<i>but NASA still relies on humans
to lead the missions.</i>
<i>but NASA still relies on humans
to lead the missions.</i>

06:01.486 --> 06:03.864
- Really?
<i>- Absolutely.</i>

06:03.947 --> 06:07.910
<i>Someone has to tell the robots
where to go and what to look for.</i>

06:07.993 --> 06:11.121
<i>In fact, how would you
like to join the team</i>

06:11.205 --> 06:14.958
<i>to help NASA search for
signs of life in the universe?</i>

06:18.462 --> 06:20.214
<i>I'll take that as a "yes."</i>

06:28.347 --> 06:30.307
<i>Welcome to your new work space.</i>

06:30.390 --> 06:31.975
Hooray! Yeah!

06:32.559 --> 06:33.810
I call robots!

06:34.394 --> 06:35.646
I'll head up research.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.940
I'll keep an eye on the monitors.

06:38.023 --> 06:41.193
I've been training my whole life for this.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.278
Data entry.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.990
And I'll keep track of the big picture.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.868
Snoopy, where'd you go, pal?

06:57.876 --> 06:59.294
Oh, I get it.

07:00.379 --> 07:04.466
Excuse me, CARA,
but Snoopy's not sure how to fit in.

07:04.550 --> 07:08.053
<i>Well, in science,
we do need good imagination.</i>

07:08.679 --> 07:13.058
<i>The power of imagination
helps us think creatively about problems</i>

07:13.141 --> 07:14.852
<i>and see things in new ways.</i>

07:20.566 --> 07:24.319
Imagination? Snoopy has plenty of that.

07:44.381 --> 07:47.759
Yes, indeed. A lot of imagination.
