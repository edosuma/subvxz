00:18.420 --> 00:20.040
I want to get this done quick-like.

00:20.050 --> 00:22.180
Screw it up,you might as
well slit your own throats

00:22.190 --> 00:24.210
and throw yourselves into the hudson.

00:25.760 --> 00:28.420

00:39.470 --> 00:41.740

that think they're faster.

00:41.760 --> 00:43.530
Not usually the irish!

00:44.600 --> 00:46.900

01:10.650 --> 01:14.200
That's for making me remember
I had asthma when I was a kid.

01:14.210 --> 01:15.590
All right?

01:18.580 --> 01:20.130
shut your mouth and keep walking.

01:25.300 --> 01:27.700
it's bono,you scuzzy knacke

01:28.020 --> 01:29.900
it's irish.

01:31.960 --> 01:33.900
My name is sam tyler.

01:33.910 --> 01:37.310
I was in an accident,and
I woke up in 1973.

01:37.320 --> 01:39.450
I don't know how or why I'm here,

01:39.460 --> 01:40.750
but whatever's happened,

01:40.760 --> 01:42.960
it's like I've landed
on a different planet.

01:42.970 --> 01:45.380
Now maybe if i can work out the reason,

01:45.390 --> 01:47.060
I can get home.

01:57.570 --> 01:58.970
Look at that.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.390
I love a woman in uniform.

02:01.400 --> 02:04.600
I bet you have a very fine set of
fun bags nestled warmly ithere,huh?

02:04.610 --> 02:06.560
Like two ferrets fighting in a sack.

02:06.570 --> 02:08.979
Oh,the beautiful irish
boys you'd bear,huh?

02:08.990 --> 02:10.680
Not much in the way of
birthing hips,though,does she?

02:10.690 --> 02:12.730
No,the skinny ones never
disappoint me,patrick.

02:12.740 --> 02:15.420
mind your manners,junior.

02:15.430 --> 02:17.690
Apologize to the lady.

02:19.860 --> 02:24.370
There's a difference between
bravery and stupidity.

02:25.010 --> 02:27.250
Now apologize.

02:28.470 --> 02:30.210
Sure.

02:32.340 --> 02:33.990
Sorry,love.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.540
let's go.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.780
I'll give you points for realism,tyler.

02:53.290 --> 02:55.470
But next time you elbow me in the gut,

02:55.490 --> 02:57.600
I ain't pulling my own punches.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.560
sorry about that,boss.

03:00.440 --> 03:01.710
Yeah.

03:01.720 --> 03:03.800
You had me really
thinkin' you were irish.

03:03.810 --> 03:05.040
you're good at accents,

03:05.050 --> 03:06.020
like rich little.

03:06.030 --> 03:07.640
What the hell you been
doing these past two weeks?

03:07.650 --> 03:11.320
You smell like flipper
after a 5-day herring bender.

03:11.330 --> 03:12.740
Yeah,well,I look like a longshoreman

03:12.750 --> 03:15.610
who's been unloading
ships full of fish all day.

03:15.620 --> 03:17.090
What do you got besides blisters?

03:17.100 --> 03:20.690
Well,big patrick's been cherry-picking
guys off the docks for covert jobs.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.610
We were off loading these
black market V.C.R...

03:23.730 --> 03:24.670
R.

03:24.690 --> 03:26.250
,Uh,those gizmos,

03:26.260 --> 03:27.210
when you guys arrived.

03:27.220 --> 03:28.830
What about jim mcmanus?

03:28.840 --> 03:30.240
Mcmanus hasn't made an appearance yet,

03:30.250 --> 03:33.050
but I heard some talk about that
truck hijacking three weeks ago.

03:33.060 --> 03:36.510
It was mcmanus and his crew who
jacked that trucoad of electronics.

03:36.520 --> 03:37.670
I knew it.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.930
Yeah,well,the truck
hasn't turned up yet.

03:40.060 --> 03:44.450
Rumor is mcmanus himself pulled
the trigger on the driver's murder.

03:45.770 --> 03:47.650
it fits his vicious M.O.

03:48.810 --> 03:50.490
Pumped fourounds into a lifeless body

03:50.500 --> 03:52.520
when anyone else would
have stopped at two.

03:52.530 --> 03:54.910
Like I said,it's just hearsay.

03:54.930 --> 03:57.190
You get closer,you watch yourself.

03:57.200 --> 04:00.720
Mcmanus has been known to sniff
out less noble rats before.

04:01.130 --> 04:03.690
He has marshmallow
guns,knives and coffins

04:03.700 --> 04:06.130
in his bowl of lucky
charms every morning.

04:06.140 --> 04:08.490
He's magically malicious.

04:09.860 --> 04:10.960
fair warning.

04:10.970 --> 04:12.880
Fair warning,tyler.

04:14.010 --> 04:16.320
Okay I better get back out there.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.310
Get him back to his chums.

04:17.320 --> 04:19.640
Oh,boss,uh,one
more thing--

04:19.649 --> 04:22.550
maybe I should get a shiner or
somethin' for appearance's sake.

04:22.560 --> 04:25.110
Yeah,you should.

04:26.740 --> 04:28.320
- ray.
- Yeah.

04:31.970 --> 04:33.400
You got it.

04:52.190 --> 04:53.950
there aren't any ashtrays
in here,are there?

04:53.960 --> 04:55.860
What are you doin'?

04:56.820 --> 04:57.550
Oh,boy.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.200
stand up.

04:59.210 --> 05:00.710
You picked,go to the right.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.770
You ain't,go to the left.

05:04.070 --> 05:06.590
- skelton
- is that an irish name?

05:07.080 --> 05:07.800
Yeah.

05:07.810 --> 05:09.570
You became a cop.

05:09.580 --> 05:12.280
You must have made
your mama so proud,huh?

05:14.120 --> 05:16.770
okay,homebound goes left,

05:16.780 --> 05:18.720
floppers go to the right.

05:18.730 --> 05:20.840
You,homebound.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.040
Homebound.

05:23.610 --> 05:25.490
Flopper.

05:25.510 --> 05:26.450
Homebound.

05:26.470 --> 05:28.220
Flopper.

05:29.670 --> 05:31.690
paddY.

05:32.820 --> 05:34.640
who's the scrappy one?

05:34.660 --> 05:36.950

05:37.220 --> 05:38.980

05:38.990 --> 05:40.880
Easy there.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.960
Scrappy,

05:45.050 --> 05:47.040
come on with us.

05:58.270 --> 05:59.760

05:59.770 --> 06:01.970
Back off.All right?

06:04.390 --> 06:06.650
Come on.Sit down and
have a drink with me.

06:10.330 --> 06:13.440
You got a name,or you want
me to call you scrappy?

06:13.470 --> 06:14.850
bono.

06:14.860 --> 06:16.680
- Bono?
- Sam bono.

06:16.700 --> 06:19.220
Dublin--the
accent?

06:19.230 --> 06:20.950
Yeah.Sandycove.

06:21.160 --> 06:23.980
there was a place my pop
used to talk about called the,

06:23.990 --> 06:25.190
uh,the fifty foot.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.860
Said it was a nice swim spot then.

06:26.870 --> 06:28.630
You familiar?

06:31.110 --> 06:33.580
Uh,I think you mean the forty foot.

06:37.570 --> 06:38.810
For--what was
I thinking?

06:38.820 --> 06:40.210
Man,what was I thinking?

06:40.220 --> 06:42.190
You got a brain on you.I like that.

06:42.340 --> 06:42.900
I tell you what.

06:42.910 --> 06:45.130
Let me introduce you
to some of the boys,huh?

06:45.590 --> 06:47.910
Here,these mooks.

06:48.410 --> 06:49.620

06:49.630 --> 06:51.050

06:51.060 --> 06:51.970

06:51.980 --> 06:53.860

06:53.880 --> 06:56.020

06:56.600 --> 06:58.910
And this here is drunk petey.

06:59.060 --> 07:00.790
Jimmy boy.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.360
Can I trouble you for a pint?

07:02.370 --> 07:03.800
Your sister ain't having it.

07:03.820 --> 07:05.450
She cut me off clean.

07:05.470 --> 07:08.310
Yeah.That's because you're
a serious neddy,drunk petey.

07:08.320 --> 07:09.630
Come on.Piss off,okay?

07:19.660 --> 07:21.450
Name it.

07:21.890 --> 07:22.850
How about your dukes?

07:22.860 --> 07:24.540
Anyone,anyhow,anywhere.

Okay,what about right now?Patrick?

07:30.820 --> 07:32.140
No.Big patrick.

07:32.150 --> 07:34.570
Hey,paddy boy.

07:34.830 --> 07:37.780
No here says he can
crush you,fist to fist.

07:37.980 --> 07:40.050
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

07:46.320 --> 07:48.540
go easy on him,okay?

07:53.240 --> 07:57.010

08:01.080 --> 08:03.470
Come on,paddy!

08:04.320 --> 08:08.260

come on!

08:15.540 --> 08:16.890
come on!

08:45.400 --> 08:46.480
wow,sammy.

08:46.490 --> 08:49.910
In irish tarot,that-- that's
a symbol of possibility.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.630
Cool,right?

08:51.810 --> 08:53.400
Hello.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.310
mommy's home!

08:55.330 --> 08:56.620
Hey,there's eggs in the B.

08:56.630 --> 08:58.610
Hello,my sweetie.

09:00.530 --> 09:02.260
colleen.

09:02.270 --> 09:04.160
I thought I said no more readings.

09:04.170 --> 09:06.330
You know they only confuse him.

09:06.350 --> 09:08.140
I know.Okay?

09:08.160 --> 09:11.150
But he got the ace of pentacles.

09:11.810 --> 09:13.310
What does that mean?

09:13.320 --> 09:16.550
It means he can make all
your dreams come true.

09:19.630 --> 09:21.080
glad you're here.

09:21.090 --> 09:24.220
You know,I was scared we'd run out
of drunken irish hoodlums today.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.760
This is my joint.

09:25.770 --> 09:27.930
I'm--
colleen.

09:27.940 --> 09:30.060
Yeah,that's right.How'd you know?

09:30.070 --> 09:33.550
Oh,I-I overheard a
couple of lads going on

09:33.560 --> 09:36.480
about a bottle of smoke that
works the bar here,named colleen.

09:36.490 --> 09:37.630
Well,pick yourself up.

09:37.640 --> 09:38.940
Dust yourself off.

09:38.950 --> 09:41.390
You're a good 2 pints behind the masses.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.060
You through playing nursemaid?

09:44.070 --> 09:45.170
Hump off.

09:45.180 --> 09:46.680
Two
rules,bono--

09:46.700 --> 09:49.130
twrules that keep anarchy
and chaos outside of this bar.

09:49.140 --> 09:53.750
One--we're a family first and
foremost,and don't you forget that.

09:53.760 --> 09:58.120
And two--don't even think about
making nice-y with my sister.

09:58.140 --> 09:59.530
here you go.

09:59.540 --> 10:02.100
Yeah,that'll ease the pain.

10:02.630 --> 10:03.950
- Jimmy?
- Yes?

10:03.960 --> 10:05.200
When will I get some work?

10:05.210 --> 10:06.910
Eh,relax your cacks,okay?

10:06.920 --> 10:09.420
I do admire your enthusiasm.

10:10.330 --> 10:12.260
No,I'll tell you what.

10:12.730 --> 10:15.480
Go to this address tonight at 7:00.Okay?

10:15.490 --> 10:16.490
Be on time.

10:16.500 --> 10:21.030
Tell 'em jimmy sent you,and you follow
their instructions to the letter.

10:21.050 --> 10:22.310
Thanks for this,boss.

10:22.320 --> 10:23.870
"thanks,boss"?

10:23.880 --> 10:26.430
You say that like I just
handed you a glass of water.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.990
All right,listen,listen,listen.Don't
talk.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.400
- Here's the thing,bono...
- why are you reading the obituaries?

10:30.420 --> 10:34.500
The least they could do,you know,print
their last words,don't you think?

10:34.520 --> 10:36.980
The toughest men
I ever seen croak--

10:36.990 --> 10:38.950
I'm talking about the
diamond-hard bastards,

10:38.970 --> 10:40.050
the stone-cold
killers--

10:40.060 --> 10:42.910
you know what their final words were?

10:42.920 --> 10:44.120
MommY.Mommy.

10:44.130 --> 10:46.450
I don't just put anybody on my team...

10:46.470 --> 10:49.070
hey ray,you believe in hell?

10:49.080 --> 10:50.550
Yeah.

10:51.060 --> 10:53.930
Sunday dinner at my mother-in-law's
with her new friend gus,

10:53.940 --> 10:55.780
who has a goiter and an undercooked ham.

10:55.790 --> 10:56.900
Come on.I'm serious.

10:56.910 --> 10:57.910
I am,too.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.280
The goiter and the uercooked
ham look very similar.

11:00.290 --> 11:04.030
I'm always afraid I'm gonna stick
my fork into the wrong pinkish blob.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.810
In hell,you think they
got flames everywhere?

11:07.290 --> 11:08.340
You want hell?

11:08.350 --> 11:09.090
I'll give you hell.

11:09.110 --> 11:12.430
Hell is sitting three hours on a
stakeout with a jibber-jawing jackass

11:12.450 --> 11:15.970
who's come down with a bad case
of "what's it all about,alfie?

11:33.040 --> 11:35.140
" this is interesting.

11:35.150 --> 11:39.450
Jimmy sent me,said I should
follow your instructions.

11:41.850 --> 11:44.080
Come on in.

11:49.790 --> 11:51.200
So...

11:51.980 --> 11:54.610
are you as good with a hammer
as you are with your hands?

11:55.020 --> 11:57.630
Well,uh,that depends on the job.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.640
Do you know what I mean?

12:05.300 --> 12:07.040
Hanging a mirror?

12:07.090 --> 12:08.790
Yeah.

12:09.680 --> 12:12.740
That brother of mine-- he's
got some sense of humor.

12:14.050 --> 12:16.150
I'll go get a hammer.

12:22.350 --> 12:24.420
detective skywalker?

12:24.980 --> 12:26.100
What--what are
you doing here?

12:26.110 --> 12:27.390
Hey,rose.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.320
There you are.

12:29.610 --> 12:33.350
Sam,this is,uh,this is
rose tyler,my new neighbor

12:33.360 --> 12:36.600
and friend and the mother of
the most beautiful little boy

12:36.610 --> 12:37.840
you've ever seen in your life.

12:37.850 --> 12:40.770
Uh,rose,this is sam bono.

12:48.390 --> 12:51.480
Uh,nice to meet you...saM.

12:51.790 --> 12:53.960
Bono.Sam bono.

12:54.630 --> 12:56.890
well,sam works for jimmy.

12:56.900 --> 12:58.580
Yep.Nice to meet you,rose.

12:58.600 --> 13:02.350
Any friend of colleen's
here is me auld segotia.

13:02.980 --> 13:04.160
uh,your accent...

13:04.170 --> 13:05.890
it's driving you wild,huh?

13:05.900 --> 13:08.540
Yeah,you and the rest of the lashes.

13:09.340 --> 13:10.870
You know,do you want a drink,sam?

13:10.880 --> 13:14.700
Only if you want to see a grown
man overcome with gratitude.

13:18.060 --> 13:18.960
what is going on?

13:18.970 --> 13:20.250
I'm workg a case,undercover.

13:20.260 --> 13:21.780
Please don't blow it for me.

13:21.800 --> 13:22.680
What are you doing here?

13:22.690 --> 13:24.490
No,what are you doing here?

13:24.500 --> 13:27.000
I-I just moved in next door.

13:27.010 --> 13:28.790
You know,with vic gone,the
rent on the old place was...

13:28.800 --> 13:30.500
well,a smaller apartment
was all we needed,

13:30.520 --> 13:33.250
and--and colleen watches sammy
sometimes,when I have to work late.

13:33.260 --> 13:35.510
Oh,here we go.

13:35.520 --> 13:37.590
Oh,no,no,no,no,no.

13:37.770 --> 13:38.610
I-I really should get going.

13:38.620 --> 13:40.710
You know,it's gonna take me
forever to get sammy to leave.

13:40.730 --> 13:42.780
I think he has a crush on colleen.

13:42.790 --> 13:45.260
I think so,too.

13:47.480 --> 13:50.710
well,I mean,who wouldn't?

13:58.240 --> 13:59.540
Find a pay phone?

13:59.550 --> 14:01.460
Yeah.I spoke to annie.

14:01.470 --> 14:04.230
This address is where
jimmy's sister lives.

14:04.240 --> 14:06.050
What,the bartender?

14:06.060 --> 14:09.290
Oh,man,she is one witchy wildcat.

14:09.300 --> 14:10.960
- You ever seen her?
- No.

14:10.970 --> 14:13.810
How come tyler gets all
the plumb undercovers?

14:13.970 --> 14:17.060
We get diamond district
rabbis and busboys.

14:17.070 --> 14:19.890
Remeer when we had to pose
as nursing home workers?

14:20.750 --> 14:24.280
Still got the smell of
granny poo on my loafers.

14:24.530 --> 14:30.130
I bet he's up there right
now,getting "in" her "cognito.

14:33.370 --> 14:35.100
" Sl*inte.

14:37.530 --> 14:40.110
well,I think it's about
time we hung the mirror.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.010
Look who's awake.

14:42.020 --> 14:43.400
Hey,sammy.

14:43.410 --> 14:44.570
Hey,sweethearT.

14:44.580 --> 14:47.060
Oh,are you ready to go home?

14:47.100 --> 14:49.220
Sammy,this is sam.

14:49.230 --> 14:51.690
Sam,this is sammy.

14:51.700 --> 14:53.950
Nice to meet you,kid.

14:54.580 --> 14:57.160
All right,say-- say
good night,sammy.

14:57.490 --> 14:59.560
Good night.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.100
- Good night.
- Good night,yeah.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.960
- Thanks,colleen.
- sure.

15:10.950 --> 15:12.910
God,can you believe you
were ever that young?

15:12.920 --> 15:14.120
No.

15:14.130 --> 15:16.960
Sometimes I think
irrived here fully grown.

15:18.050 --> 15:19.590
so,uh...

15:20.170 --> 15:22.640
do you still shuffle an
irish tarot deck,do you?

15:22.650 --> 15:24.010
I do.

15:24.030 --> 15:26.030
How do you know that?

15:26.110 --> 15:29.690
Oh,uh,one of jimmy's boys mentioned it.

15:29.700 --> 15:31.650
They thought it was odd.

15:33.160 --> 15:36.660
Well,you know what?If any one of them
had an ounce of the mystic in them

15:36.670 --> 15:39.340
,maybe they wouldn't
be so all-day angry.

15:39.350 --> 15:41.830
It takes a keen eye to hang a mirror.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.970
A little bit too much to the left,a
little bit too much to the right,

15:44.980 --> 15:48.300
and it all gets banjaxed.

15:48.690 --> 15:50.250
Ta-da.

15:50.680 --> 15:54.360
Well,clearly jimmy hired
the right man for the job.

15:58.880 --> 16:01.700
Well,I should be off.

16:18.100 --> 16:19.420
detective skywalker.

16:19.430 --> 16:21.460
Uh,or sam or whoever you are right now.

16:21.470 --> 16:23.930
I'm--I'm sorry
about that.

16:24.040 --> 16:26.610
I just wanted to see
how you guys are doin'.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.800
Oh,we're fine.

16:29.460 --> 16:30.970
Well,aside from the
fact that my son thinks

16:30.980 --> 16:33.990
his father's on a very
long business trip.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.140
And I don't know when or
how to tell him otherwise.

16:38.220 --> 16:40.810
Um,is--is colleen in
some kind of trouble?

16:40.820 --> 16:42.310
If so,I'd really like to know.

16:42.320 --> 16:47.390
Well,all--all I can say is that her
brother's mixed up in some shady stuff.

16:47.410 --> 16:49.710
So do me a favor.

16:49.720 --> 16:52.290
Stay away from her,okay?

16:52.820 --> 16:54.340
Okay,I'll do that...

16:54.350 --> 16:57.280
- thank you.
- If you'll do something for me.

16:57.630 --> 16:59.310
Of course.Anything.

16:59.320 --> 17:02.120
Will you talk to sammy?

17:03.460 --> 17:05.220
Talk to him?

17:05.240 --> 17:06.599
I...

17:07.260 --> 17:08.569
about what?

17:08.589 --> 17:10.540
I'm worried.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.599
He's changed since his father left.

17:12.609 --> 17:14.240
You know,he's angry.

17:14.250 --> 17:17.369
He threw a rock at a
neighborhood boy last week.

17:17.849 --> 17:21.780
You were right,detective,about vic.

17:22.450 --> 17:24.650
You warned me,and you were right.

17:25.760 --> 17:29.110
Sammy needs a man in his life,

17:29.570 --> 17:31.320
a good man,

17:31.370 --> 17:32.790
like you.

17:32.840 --> 17:35.250
Just to talk to.

17:36.090 --> 17:38.270
I'm doing everything I can,but...

17:39.080 --> 17:39.910
- rose.
- Will you

17:39.920 --> 17:42.820
will you please
just--just talk to him?

17:42.830 --> 17:44.790
Please.

17:44.800 --> 17:48.530
It would mean so much
to sammy and to me.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.440
I'm sorry.I,um...

17:57.270 --> 17:59.150
I'm sorry.

17:59.260 --> 18:01.220
I really want to help you,

18:01.930 --> 18:04.570
but I can't do that.

18:10.030 --> 18:11.360
okay.

18:12.850 --> 18:15.810
I'm not sure I understand why,but,um,

18:16.940 --> 18:19.490
I can't say that I'm surprised.

18:20.400 --> 18:24.710
Since we've met,you've been nothing
but a-a puzzle with several lost pieces.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.810
- Oh,rose.
- Thanks anyway.

18:26.820 --> 18:28.370
- Well,listen.
- Just...

18:28.860 --> 18:31.120
I still need you to stay
away from jimmy mcmanus.

18:31.130 --> 18:32.170
Do you understand?

18:32.180 --> 18:34.820
You and sammy both.

18:35.490 --> 18:37.170
mommy.

18:38.090 --> 18:40.470
I had a bad dream.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.240
He can hardlsleep.

18:42.250 --> 18:44.580
He's afraid of his own dreams.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.810
Good night...

18:47.820 --> 18:50.110
mrs.Tyler.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.170
********

18:54.180 --> 18:55.580
- she was your babysitter.
- Yes.

18:55.590 --> 18:57.970
Crazy jimmy mcmanus' sister,colleen,

18:57.980 --> 19:01.450
was your babysitter back
in-- no,here in 1973.

19:01.460 --> 19:01.910
That's right.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.890
And I didn't realize it
at the time or even later.

19:03.910 --> 19:05.780
In fact,it only just occurred
to me when I saw her today.

19:05.790 --> 19:09.190
But she pretty much forged my taste
in all the women who came after her.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.320
- Really?
- Yeah,well,

19:11.330 --> 19:15.290
one's formative years being
so crucial and a that,you know.

19:15.310 --> 19:17.320
So does maya look like her?

19:17.330 --> 19:19.100
Um,no,not at all.

19:19.110 --> 19:20.150
And now here she is.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.720
She's jimmy mcmanus' sister,and
she's living next door to my mother,

19:22.730 --> 19:25.370
- so I can't help but think
- oh,please don't say it.

19:25.380 --> 19:27.820
- What?
- Don't say "maybe that's why I'm here,

19:27.830 --> 19:29.940
" because you keep saying,"maybe
that's why I'm here,"

19:29.960 --> 19:31.130
and every time you say it,

19:31.140 --> 19:34.450
I think maybe the reason you're
here is to drive me utterly insane.

19:34.460 --> 19:37.930
Okay.Look,I know this all
seems like nonsense to you,

19:37.940 --> 19:39.350
the ravings of a lunatic.

19:39.360 --> 19:40.820
I appreciate that.

19:40.830 --> 19:42.270
You know,you've tried
to go there with me,

19:42.280 --> 19:45.510
you haven't called the men from
the funny farm to take me away.

19:45.520 --> 19:46.280
Not yet.

19:46.290 --> 19:47.720
You kept my confidence.

19:47.730 --> 19:50.640
I am so grateful for that.

19:51.130 --> 19:56.590
So I can only promise that if I
ever do get back to 2008 or 2009

19:56.600 --> 19:58.850
or wtever the hell it is right now,

19:58.870 --> 20:00.990
I will make it up to you.

20:02.740 --> 20:04.940
I'll take you out for sushi at nobu.

20:04.950 --> 20:07.740
I will fill your ipod with the
entire justin timberlake catalog.

20:07.750 --> 20:10.150
I will fly you down to the epcot
center to show you the spaceship earth.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.790
Okay.

20:11.800 --> 20:12.550
- Okay?
- Okay.

20:12.570 --> 20:14.600
- Okay.
- It's a deal,sam.

20:15.950 --> 20:18.750
Uh,if you ever get back
to wherever you're fm,

20:18.760 --> 20:22.540
you can take me with you
and do all those things.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.820
Okay.It's a deal.

20:26.430 --> 20:28.600
It's a deal.

20:30.510 --> 20:32.290
What is sushi?

20:34.360 --> 20:36.040
I think that sam's
plan to work the sister

20:36.060 --> 20:37.280
has got nothing to do with the case

20:37.290 --> 20:39.600
and everything to do with her ass.

20:43.340 --> 20:46.450
I can handle the silent
treatment,believe you me.

20:46.550 --> 20:49.210
I married the eldest stovack sister.

20:49.220 --> 20:51.080
Ignoring me for days on end

20:51.090 --> 20:53.930
is the favorite weapon in her arsenal.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.760
I ain't gonna crack,junior.

21:10.340 --> 21:11.560
All right.

21:11.670 --> 21:12.960
Fine.

21:13.170 --> 21:14.540
On the subject of the afterlife,

21:14.560 --> 21:15.820
here is my
opinion--

21:15.830 --> 21:18.310
depending on how we
behave here on earth,

21:18.320 --> 21:21.400
we either go to heaven or go to hell.

21:21.410 --> 21:23.630
In heaven,it's all dancing girls,

21:23.640 --> 21:27.740
ice cream sundaes,rivers of
bourbon,led zeppelin music,

21:27.750 --> 21:29.330
no one's allowed to wear any clothes,

21:29.340 --> 21:31.470
you have to have sex
at least ten times a day

21:31.480 --> 21:33.330
and eat pizza when
you're not having sex.

21:33.340 --> 21:35.610
It's like a rule there.

21:35.810 --> 21:36.770
Well,so what's hell?

21:36.780 --> 21:39.570
Hell is just a great big window

21:39.580 --> 21:41.930
you have to sit behind all day long

21:41.940 --> 21:44.710
and watch what goes on in heaven.

21:51.900 --> 21:53.390
yodel yo.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.070
jimmy sleeping one off?

21:55.080 --> 21:57.780
No,he don't get up until the
corned beef's on the table.

21:57.790 --> 22:00.380
Not that I think you're
really here looking for jimmy.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.100
Am I that transparent?

22:02.690 --> 22:03.870
you drinkin'?

22:03.880 --> 22:05.600
Always.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.420
What makes you think I
want anything from you?

22:13.430 --> 22:16.730
Well,men only talk to
women for two reasons.

22:16.760 --> 22:21.280
When they want their house
cleaned or their mouse cleaned.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.100
true,I could have you any time I wanted.

22:28.270 --> 22:29.360
oh,you think so?

22:29.370 --> 22:30.780
- Oh,I do.
- Why?

22:30.790 --> 22:33.860
Because you fancy
yourself some tough guy?

22:34.320 --> 22:37.840
I mean,do you really think that's
appealing to jimmy mcmanus' sister?

22:37.980 --> 22:39.990
I mean,I grew up around
all these hard shells

22:40.000 --> 22:42.600
with their fists and
their guns and their anger.

22:42.610 --> 22:46.870
Do you think I find that
even remotely attractive?

22:49.090 --> 22:53.660
Well,I also make,uh,lace curtains
out of dried pineapple rings.

22:59.240 --> 23:01.310
You're getting warmer.

23:06.700 --> 23:08.890
Woo me.

23:09.500 --> 23:11.960
W-woo you?

23:12.900 --> 23:15.230
I need woo.

23:27.680 --> 23:29.300
not here.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.340
maybe we should go to your place.

23:34.350 --> 23:36.910
Sammy and rosie live right next door.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.230
What if little sammy hears?

23:39.250 --> 23:41.460
His bedroom's right against the wall.

23:42.760 --> 23:44.050
trust me.

23:44.060 --> 23:45.840
He won't mind.

23:50.870 --> 23:53.710
so you know,I'm not a loose boot.

23:55.260 --> 23:59.050
I was the only girl at
st.Edmund'S...st.Spreadmund'S...

23:59.060 --> 24:02.530
who didn't lose her
virginity until she was 16.

24:02.610 --> 24:04.190
st.Spreadmund'S.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.030
Well,what do you know?

24:06.500 --> 24:07.390
What?What is it?

24:07.400 --> 24:09.190
This is the tower card.

24:09.200 --> 24:09.900
What does that mean?

24:09.910 --> 24:13.120
Well,the tower card means that
as long as we remain inert,

24:13.130 --> 24:16.330
nothing will change,no
progress will be made,

24:16.340 --> 24:18.460
until we take action.

24:18.470 --> 24:19.410
Take action?

24:19.420 --> 24:21.310
Yeah,take action.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.730
No matter how that action might mean

24:23.740 --> 24:26.530
the end of everything we deem sacred.

24:30.230 --> 24:32.970
If you could go back in time

24:32.990 --> 24:35.580
and talk to yourself as a kid...

24:36.180 --> 24:38.430
- Would you do it?
- Absolutely.

24:38.440 --> 24:41.750
Mostly to warn myself about my ex.

24:42.530 --> 24:43.900
You?

24:44.760 --> 24:46.490
I can't do it.

24:46.640 --> 24:48.110
Can't?

24:48.570 --> 24:50.040
Won'T.

24:50.050 --> 24:52.490
I mean,I wouldn'T.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.260
Facing yourself that young means

24:54.280 --> 24:55.710
you can change anything you want

24:55.720 --> 24:57.740
in your life with just a few words.

24:59.300 --> 25:02.780
All the painful memories,all
the wrong turns...

25:04.560 --> 25:09.130
having that power makes you question
every choice you've ever made.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.300
Who wants to face that?

25:17.340 --> 25:18.690
What is it?

25:18.830 --> 25:20.490
Nothin'.

25:23.940 --> 25:27.500
You're not like any of the
thugs in my brother's employ.

25:28.650 --> 25:30.840
You don't kiss like one either.

25:30.850 --> 25:32.920
You kissed many of them,have you?

25:34.310 --> 25:35.890
You really shouldn't
let my brother jimmy

25:35.900 --> 25:39.110
know you have brains to
go with those good looks.

25:39.500 --> 25:43.190
Has he,uh,mentioned anything about...

25:43.840 --> 25:45.680
well,has he mentioned anything?

25:45.690 --> 25:46.540
About what?

25:46.550 --> 25:49.450
About anything,you know,about,uh,

25:49.460 --> 25:52.380
me,about what his intentions are.

25:53.080 --> 25:55.470
We don't talk about his business.

25:55.790 --> 25:58.050
I try not to talk about mine.

26:03.250 --> 26:06.560
you've got to be the stupidest idiot
ever to walk upright,you know that?

26:06.570 --> 26:07.990
Hey,big patrick.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.590
Oh,little patrick,too.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.650
Where's medium-size patrick?

26:11.660 --> 26:13.210
He have the day off?

26:15.270 --> 26:16.620
oh,look who it is.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.650
You got anything you wanna tell me?

26:19.010 --> 26:20.580
Jimmy.

26:20.950 --> 26:24.110
I got nothin' to say to
you you don't already know.

26:24.210 --> 26:25.950
You scuttle my sister.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.780
I take you under my wing,my new prot?

26:27.790 --> 26:30.560
If it was a patrick or sean,

26:30.570 --> 26:33.200
they'd be meeting my favorite
cleaver,I swear to god.

26:33.210 --> 26:35.040
But you...

26:35.470 --> 26:37.340
you got style.

26:38.300 --> 26:40.760
You got something dark in
your soul,and I like that.

26:41.940 --> 26:44.060
You could only really work for me.

26:47.980 --> 26:49.590
come have a drink.

26:54.380 --> 26:55.380
here.

26:55.390 --> 26:56.720
Have another drink,ah?

26:56.730 --> 26:58.060
Let's have a shot or two to

26:58.070 --> 27:00.740
welcome you into our
little enclave,okay?

27:00.750 --> 27:02.620
sl*inte.

27:06.730 --> 27:08.190
Wanna see somethin'?

27:09.110 --> 27:12.430
The picture there,with the
dog-- that's my old man.

27:12.800 --> 27:14.170
Nasty S.O.B.

27:14.180 --> 27:18.180
He had these shoes
that,uh,when he walked,

27:18.190 --> 27:20.320
made this horrible sound.

27:20.340 --> 27:26.570
Kinda hard to explain,but like
a click-clack-clack,click-click.

27:28.030 --> 27:30.180
You always knew he was
comin' down the hall.

27:30.200 --> 27:34.470
The typical irish sad story.

27:35.430 --> 27:37.440
Old man comes home drunk,

27:38.450 --> 27:40.550
beats the crap out of me,

27:40.660 --> 27:42.880
beats the crap out of colleen.

27:43.520 --> 27:47.540
He was a rough S.O.B.

27:47.550 --> 27:49.110
All around.

27:49.450 --> 27:51.010
Mine,too.

27:51.770 --> 27:53.290
Well...

27:53.440 --> 27:55.980
so what did you ?

27:57.740 --> 28:00.170
I went down to the docks
where he was workin',

28:00.750 --> 28:03.240
and he sees me,sees me walkin' up,

28:03.250 --> 28:06.210
and he says,"what do
you-- what do you want,boy?

28:07.520 --> 28:09.720
" And I say,"pa,smile.

28:09.730 --> 28:14.560
" And I take a tire iron,and
I crack his skull two times.

28:16.030 --> 28:17.190
You killed him?

28:17.210 --> 28:19.270
Oh,god,no.

28:20.100 --> 28:22.280
That's my father.

28:23.500 --> 28:28.360
But he's layin' there,and
blood's all over his face.

28:29.330 --> 28:31.540
And he looks up,

28:32.160 --> 28:34.880
and he says to me,"about time,boy.

28:35.250 --> 28:36.780
About time.

28:37.960 --> 28:40.080
" Then I'm walkin' away...

28:41.450 --> 28:45.570
and I hear that same sound,the
cck-click-clack thing.

28:46.030 --> 28:48.110
And he's still on the ground.

28:49.510 --> 28:52.040
The sound's coming from my own shoes.

28:55.290 --> 28:57.220
'Cause eventually,we
all become our fathers.

28:57.230 --> 28:59.090
There's no getting around it.

29:01.230 --> 29:03.320
I believe we can change who we are.

29:03.330 --> 29:04.940
No way,no change.

29:04.950 --> 29:08.010
We're spurned from their loins.

29:09.050 --> 29:11.230
So whether we like it or not,

29:12.620 --> 29:14.510
we wind up just like 'em.

29:22.040 --> 29:24.160
let's have a drink to you...

29:24.840 --> 29:27.130
saving your sister.

29:31.580 --> 29:33.890
I love colleen.

29:34.030 --> 29:36.880
I love colleen so much

29:36.890 --> 29:39.840
that I can't even put it into words.

29:40.060 --> 29:41.990
I love her more than
I love my own heart,

29:42.000 --> 29:45.700
which is why it hurts me to my...

29:46.980 --> 29:49.280
**********

29:49.300 --> 29:51.010
jimmy,come on.Now it wasn't like that.

29:51.020 --> 29:53.130
You know,me and
her-- we're not...

29:53.140 --> 29:56.470
I'm not talking about you and
she and your fornications,okay?

29:56.480 --> 29:57.660
It's got nothing to do with that.

29:57.670 --> 30:00.080
Colleen talked to the cops.

30:02.110 --> 30:04.300
My own sister.

30:04.580 --> 30:06.380
How do you know that?

30:10.820 --> 30:12.570
jimmy?

30:12.850 --> 30:14.080
Come on,man.This is crazy.

30:14.090 --> 30:15.530
You don't have to do this.

30:15.540 --> 30:17.740
No,I don't,do I?

30:17.770 --> 30:19.220
You do.

30:19.230 --> 30:20.030
What?

30:20.040 --> 30:21.760
We're talkin' about your future now.

30:21.770 --> 30:23.790
You do the honors.

30:24.330 --> 30:25.790
Take the gun.

30:29.780 --> 30:30.900
You're family now.

30:30.910 --> 30:32.260
Take the gun!

30:32.270 --> 30:34.420
She ain't worth it.

30:37.420 --> 30:38.450
There you go.

30:38.460 --> 30:39.880
I can't do it.

30:39.890 --> 30:43.370
Sistercide--that's a cross I refuse
to bear,and I ain't goin' to hell.

30:43.380 --> 30:45.110
It doesn't have to be like this.

30:45.120 --> 30:47.000
Wh,some passionate chumminess,

30:47.010 --> 30:49.070
and all of a sudden you're
telling me how it's gonna be?

30:50.250 --> 30:53.300
Pray tell,what do you say,sister sweet?

30:53.310 --> 30:55.120
Jimmy,I'm no rat!

30:55.130 --> 30:56.410
Please,you gotta believe me!

30:56.420 --> 30:58.830
Shh.You're a rat.

30:58.850 --> 31:01.410
My own sister,a rat.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.980
What are you standing over
there like a delicate flower for?

31:04.090 --> 31:06.240
Shoot her!Come on!

31:07.240 --> 31:08.400
yodel yo yo!

31:08.410 --> 31:09.590
Shut up,petey!

31:09.610 --> 31:10.970
She ain't talkin' to no cops.

31:10.980 --> 31:13.520
I got a gut feeling about it,and
my gut feeling's not wrong.

31:13.530 --> 31:14.880
When I tell you to
shoot her,you shoot her!

31:14.890 --> 31:17.250
I can guarantee she's
not talking to any cops.

31:17.270 --> 31:20.050
Guarantee?You can't guarantee anything!

31:20.060 --> 31:23.030
- How?
- because I am a cop!

31:29.680 --> 31:30.800
Come again?

31:30.810 --> 31:31.880
He said he's a cop.

31:31.900 --> 31:33.190
I heard what he said,okay?

31:33.200 --> 31:34.770
It's a rhetorical question,okay?

31:34.790 --> 31:36.800
Shut up,moron.You're a pig.

31:36.810 --> 31:38.780
Yodel yo yo yo!

31:38.800 --> 31:40.210
Yeah.

31:40.220 --> 31:43.120
I got a badge number
aneverything--2-4-6.

31:43.130 --> 31:46.260
Jimmy mcmanus,we want
you for murder,extortion,

31:46.280 --> 31:47.730
racketeering,armed robbery

31:47.740 --> 31:50.510
and for just being a
plain,old nasty bastard.

31:51.590 --> 31:52.430
against the wall!

31:52.450 --> 31:54.170
Everybody,up against the wall!

31:54.180 --> 31:55.240
Move!

31:55.260 --> 31:57.430
Against the wall!Let's move!Now!

31:57.440 --> 31:58.020
Let's go!

31:58.030 --> 32:00.040
This isn't loaded,is it?

32:02.470 --> 32:04.360
that was great.

32:06.540 --> 32:07.340
damn it!

32:07.350 --> 32:09.220
Come on now.

32:09.340 --> 32:10.650
Nice job,sis.

32:10.660 --> 32:11.950
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

32:11.960 --> 32:14.370
God bless you.Very nice.

32:14.380 --> 32:16.180
Good.You're great.

32:16.280 --> 32:19.040
Now it's your turn to get on your knees.

32:19.480 --> 32:20.450
get on your knees.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.850
I'm not gonna tell you again.

32:25.210 --> 32:27.180
Get on your knees!

32:33.370 --> 32:35.530
Send this rodent to the rain.

32:35.560 --> 32:36.760
You meet any saints along the way,

32:36.770 --> 32:38.510
put a good word in for me,please,okay?

32:38.520 --> 32:40.360
We could've been friends.

32:40.370 --> 32:42.300
- Where's the car?
- It's out back,jimmy.

32:43.090 --> 32:45.000
I don't need to see this.

32:48.140 --> 32:51.620
You know,there's two kinds
of guys that roam the kitchen.

32:51.640 --> 32:54.210
There's crooks,and there's cops.

32:55.340 --> 32:57.380
And as I said before,

32:57.780 --> 33:00.830
you don't kiss like no crook.

33:03.130 --> 33:05.780
Why couldn't you be real?

33:09.240 --> 33:11.400
police!Get your hands up!

33:11.580 --> 33:12.080
Hands up!

33:12.090 --> 33:13.670
Mcmanus went out the
back!He went out the back!

33:13.680 --> 33:15.650
freeze!Drop the gun!

33:18.790 --> 33:20.870
- Got him!
- get her out of here.

33:24.010 --> 33:25.480
move it.

33:30.140 --> 33:31.370
let's go.

33:33.350 --> 33:35.130
Pretty good timing,boss.

33:35.240 --> 33:36.820
The nose knows,huh?

33:36.840 --> 33:41.210
The nose has an inside guy
to watch your sorry ass.

33:43.280 --> 33:46.360
"yodel yo" means everything's jake.

33:46.370 --> 33:49.070
"Yodel yo yo" means marshall the troops.

33:49.080 --> 33:52.540
"Yodel yo yo yo" means get
your angry asses in here.

33:52.550 --> 33:53.660
Sergeant pete cochran.

33:53.670 --> 33:54.930
Been under since you been under,

33:54.940 --> 33:59.560
except all he needs
is whiskey and a wire.

34:00.670 --> 34:01.200
Okay.

34:01.220 --> 34:03.510
I-I don't know whether to be
flattered or insulted,boss.

34:03.520 --> 34:05.310
I'd go for both.

34:05.480 --> 34:09.090
I trust you enough to worry about you,

34:09.100 --> 34:12.020
but I worry about you
enough not to trust you.

34:12.690 --> 34:13.969
- Good work.
- Yeah.

34:14.750 --> 34:16.989
Mcmanus is in the wind,loot.

34:21.820 --> 34:23.760
Word on the spit is that your brother

34:23.770 --> 34:26.320
turned tail and is
headed to celtic town.

34:26.330 --> 34:28.239
What do you know about that?

34:28.260 --> 34:30.370
I don't know nothin'.

34:30.659 --> 34:33.070
You know,thing about a girl like you?

34:34.989 --> 34:37.940
I see you walking down
the street,and I may say,"

34:38.110 --> 34:41.850
wow.That's one sexy chick.

34:41.860 --> 34:44.389
" But knowing what you're really like...

34:44.920 --> 34:46.810
on the inside...

34:47.989 --> 34:52.239
you're uglier than a
photo of a bulldog's hole.

34:55.820 --> 34:57.139
hey,bono?

34:57.150 --> 34:59.180
You know,I wonder,

34:59.190 --> 35:02.990
do your pals here-- do they
know who you really are?

35:04.600 --> 35:06.810
They know you
have a dark side--

35:06.880 --> 35:09.880
how you beat big patrick to a pulp...

35:10.810 --> 35:14.070
how you lie and pretend
to be someone you're not?

35:14.130 --> 35:15.520
Shut up.

35:16.190 --> 35:18.810
He's closer to my
brother than he is to you.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.420
I said shut up!

35:22.310 --> 35:24.750
I don't know,sugar lips.

35:24.870 --> 35:27.920
He's pretty damn close to me right now.

35:35.750 --> 35:37.270
wallet.

35:54.500 --> 35:57.750
there's a message from
rose tyler to a commander...

35:57.920 --> 35:59.710
skywalker?

36:00.430 --> 36:03.250
uh,she hopes you'll
decide to change your mind.

36:03.430 --> 36:04.620
Oh,yeah.

36:04.630 --> 36:06.410
She's,um...

36:07.130 --> 36:08.920
rose...

36:10.070 --> 36:12.020
wants me to speak to her son.

36:12.480 --> 36:13.610
Rose tyler.

36:13.620 --> 36:14.780
Yeah.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.080
The woman you believe to be your...

36:17.090 --> 36:18.570
your mother...

36:18.580 --> 36:20.060
wants you to talk to yourself?

36:20.070 --> 36:22.280
Yeah,she wants me to speak to...

36:22.970 --> 36:24.100
me.

36:24.120 --> 36:25.580
But I figured if I put it like that,

36:25.600 --> 36:28.320
you'd give me one of
your epic looks of pity.

36:28.940 --> 36:31.810
Why does she want you to talk to you?

36:31.820 --> 36:33.670
Apparently,I've...

36:33.810 --> 36:35.770
well,he'S...

36:36.140 --> 36:40.900
okay,we've been having
trouble ever since my...

36:42.100 --> 36:44.010
ever since vic left.

36:44.470 --> 36:46.160
Are you gonna do it?

36:46.490 --> 36:48.080
I don't think so.

36:48.870 --> 36:50.710
What if by me talking to me,

36:50.720 --> 36:51.580
I say the wrong thing,

36:51.590 --> 36:55.690
and that wrong thing brings about
some kind of tragic result...

36:56.360 --> 36:58.300
some kind of bad ending?

36:58.610 --> 37:00.460
I mean,this is all...

37:00.910 --> 37:04.390
I mean,it's pretty--
it's pretty fragile,annie.

37:08.530 --> 37:11.170
What if the simple act of

37:11.380 --> 37:14.400
talking to my younger
self brings about...

37:14.770 --> 37:16.380
darkness?

37:21.340 --> 37:23.440
You're trying to remember where
you put the phone number of the men

37:23.450 --> 37:26.190
from the funny farm
right now,aren't you?

37:26.720 --> 37:28.660
It's in my other coat.

37:32.420 --> 37:33.690
sam?

37:35.470 --> 37:37.550
You do have to ask yourself,

37:38.150 --> 37:42.330
if you don't talk to him,who will?

37:47.610 --> 37:49.770
Glad you changed your mind,detective.

37:50.030 --> 37:53.720
Yeah,well,I didn't want
just anyone talking to him.

37:54.570 --> 37:56.740
Sam,he's heartbroken about colleen.

37:57.130 --> 37:58.720
Eh,he'll get over it.

37:58.740 --> 38:01.600
Sometimes a faasy is
better than the reality.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.180
Yeah.

38:03.340 --> 38:05.960
Sammy,I have somebody
who wants to talk to you.

38:05.970 --> 38:07.940
He's a policeman.

38:08.220 --> 38:09.210
Come on out now.

38:09.220 --> 38:10.800
No.

38:11.410 --> 38:13.400
You know what?Just give us a minute.

38:13.420 --> 38:16.060
I did the same thing when I was his age.

38:17.190 --> 38:18.220
Okay.

38:27.090 --> 38:29.640
she's gone.You can come out now.

38:52.510 --> 38:55.060
my name is detective skywalker.

38:55.870 --> 38:58.040
You can call me luke.

38:59.060 --> 39:01.750
your mom tells me you got
into a fight last week.

39:02.230 --> 39:04.580
And the kid you fought
with-- jerry flood--

39:04.600 --> 39:07.110
he made fun of you in
front of your friends.

39:07.470 --> 39:09.270
So you...

39:09.820 --> 39:11.660
threw a rock at him.

39:11.680 --> 39:14.840
I bet your mom said
you were a bad boy,huh?

39:15.020 --> 39:16.390
'Cause,you know,when I was growing up,

39:16.400 --> 39:20.430
my mom said I was a
bad boy,too,sometimes.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.060
I guess she was always scared

39:25.540 --> 39:27.620
I'd turn out like my father.

39:32.890 --> 39:35.540
was your father bad,luke?

39:36.890 --> 39:39.290
my father...

39:40.890 --> 39:43.280
went over to the dark side.

39:46.320 --> 39:48.630
but I know there was still good in him.

39:49.010 --> 39:51.090
And I know that you threw that rock

39:51.100 --> 39:52.420
because you're upset that your dad

39:52.430 --> 39:55.910
is away on a long business trip.

39:56.100 --> 39:58.780
And now your babysitter colleen is in...

39:58.790 --> 40:00.760
well,she'S...

40:00.780 --> 40:02.380
okay,she's moved to florida.

40:02.390 --> 40:04.720
But there'll be other
babysitters,especially jenny.

40:04.730 --> 40:05.800
I mean,wow.

40:05.810 --> 40:07.090
Jenny is like...

40:07.100 --> 40:08.570
when you're 10,you're gonna love jenny.

40:08.580 --> 40:11.060
They're not coming back,are they?

40:13.660 --> 40:15.690
I wouldn't count on it.

40:17.230 --> 40:20.530
people just go away,you know?

40:22.900 --> 40:25.320
it's not your fault.

40:27.500 --> 40:29.500
it's not my fault?

40:31.250 --> 40:32.710
It's not.

40:34.110 --> 40:36.690
It's just life.

40:41.940 --> 40:43.280
life?

40:45.190 --> 40:46.430
Life.

40:50.960 --> 40:53.250
This guys' zooted.Hit
him with the lights.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.180
people come in and out of our lives,

40:57.400 --> 40:59.480
and they help shape who we are.

41:06.140 --> 41:09.130
and we really hope that
the good ones stick around.

41:13.020 --> 41:14.510
somebody's having an alkie-holiday.

41:14.520 --> 41:16.970
Top of the mornin' to you,lads.

41:27.800 --> 41:30.760

41:31.060 --> 41:33.760
Sometimes they just away.
